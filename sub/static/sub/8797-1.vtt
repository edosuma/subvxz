03:37.400 --> 03:40.130
You fuck, you broke it.

04:20.976 --> 04:22.410
What the hell was that?

04:22.578 --> 04:24.068
What was what?

04:24.247 --> 04:27.114
I'm referring to the enormous
underwater explosion.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.414
- Alfonz?
- What?

04:33.623 --> 04:35.614
Do you have any idea what this is?

04:35.792 --> 04:39.319
I would guess it is a piece of a plate
from Howard Johnson's.

04:39.495 --> 04:41.929
Do you have any idea what this is, buddy?

04:42.098 --> 04:43.258
This is it.

04:43.433 --> 04:46.561
This is it, man, this is what
I've been looking for for eight years.

04:46.736 --> 04:48.431
Eight years.

04:49.405 --> 04:50.531
Huh?

04:50.707 --> 04:53.198
Oh, good God. Oh, thank you.

04:53.376 --> 04:56.277
Oh, baby, I knew you were here.
Oh, yes, you are.

04:56.846 --> 04:58.507
Where's the boat?

04:58.681 --> 05:00.876
- Where's the boat?
- I don't know.

05:01.985 --> 05:04.180
What, did somebody just take it?

05:10.593 --> 05:11.617
I found it.

05:13.296 --> 05:16.527
- What do you mean? Where is it?
- It will come to you.

05:22.905 --> 05:24.566
Oh, no.

05:24.741 --> 05:27.209
For some reason,
I'm not entirely surprised.

05:27.377 --> 05:29.402
Oh, no.

06:03.146 --> 06:05.410
- Hey, guys.
- Get in.

06:05.581 --> 06:09.847
- You wanna know where the boat went.
- It took us a minute to figure it out too.

06:10.019 --> 06:12.749
- You sunk it.
- Listen, Curtis, forget the boat.

06:12.922 --> 06:15.288
We found something.
I mean, we found something.

06:15.458 --> 06:19.258
Bigg Bunny spent some major bank
on that leaky-ass piece of shit.

06:19.429 --> 06:20.521
How come it sunk?

06:20.696 --> 06:22.926
Look, boats sink.
I mean, nobody knows why.

06:23.099 --> 06:24.396
Can I show you what I found?

06:24.567 --> 06:26.694
- I think it was the compressor.
- Don't help me.

06:26.869 --> 06:29.804
I want them to know it was you
who stole their money.

06:29.972 --> 06:31.564
You didn't buy a new compressor?

06:32.075 --> 06:35.476
- It's okay if I take off now?
- Yeah, man, we don't care about you.

06:35.645 --> 06:39.046
Oh, you disloyal Ukrainian prick.

06:45.054 --> 06:47.716
Ho! Ho! Ho! Easy.

06:47.890 --> 06:50.085
Get in the damn boat.

06:58.468 --> 07:00.231
Oh...

07:12.115 --> 07:14.106
Oh...

07:16.352 --> 07:18.320
What perfect hair.

07:18.488 --> 07:20.513
What a perfect hairstyle.

07:20.690 --> 07:24.990
Oh, my God, what perfect nails.
Where did you get them done?

07:25.161 --> 07:29.393
You did them yourself? Oh, my God.

07:29.565 --> 07:32.432
They're so incredibly perfect.

07:32.602 --> 07:37.471
Like your incredibly perfect face,
and your...

07:38.608 --> 07:40.838
...perfect personality.

07:42.111 --> 07:44.705
Ugh. Ooh.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.746
That's nice.

07:52.054 --> 07:55.251
Lillian, I've called Teddy and Purdy...

07:55.424 --> 07:58.621
...and they're not going to tell
their editors...

07:58.794 --> 08:00.853
...not to publish stories about her.

08:01.030 --> 08:03.498
It's how they make a living. Anyway...

08:03.666 --> 08:06.294
...what about the other half-dozen
bloody magazines...

08:06.469 --> 08:08.460
...she's always appearing in
half-clothed...

08:08.638 --> 08:11.129
...and halfway on her way
to the bloody halfway house?

08:11.307 --> 08:12.399
Crush them too?

08:12.575 --> 08:15.635
No, no, no, I assure you
that as soon as Gemma arrives...

08:15.811 --> 08:19.406
...I have every intention of giving her
a very firm talking-to, and l...

08:20.483 --> 08:22.974
Hello? Oh...

08:25.655 --> 08:27.145
My ex-wife.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.186
Yes, sir.

08:33.229 --> 08:35.595
Was there something else, uh?

08:36.432 --> 08:38.866
- Tess.
- I'm sorry. Tess, yes.

08:39.034 --> 08:40.400
No, sir.

08:40.570 --> 08:44.336
I just wanted to tell you how much
I appreciate you accommodating me.

08:45.474 --> 08:46.907
How did I do that?

08:47.777 --> 08:51.235
You know, by agreeing to stop
in Key West for my thing tomorrow.

08:52.114 --> 08:53.342
Your thing?

08:54.217 --> 08:57.186
Oh, yes, I remember.
Married, are you getting?

08:57.353 --> 08:59.913
Oh, no.

09:00.256 --> 09:01.848
Divorced.

09:03.192 --> 09:04.659
Oh.

09:04.927 --> 09:05.951
Your idea?

09:06.128 --> 09:07.595
Yeah.

09:08.097 --> 09:10.031
I don't mean to pry, just...

09:10.633 --> 09:13.101
That's all right.
I'll tell you all about it sometime.

09:14.136 --> 09:15.728
If you like.

09:18.774 --> 09:20.799
Anyway, thanks again.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.272
You're welcome.

09:30.019 --> 09:36.754
I authorized $62,581.43 to fix that boat.

09:40.596 --> 09:42.120
So where my money at?

09:42.298 --> 09:44.926
Oh, God, I don't know, um...
It's all over.

09:45.101 --> 09:46.295
All over where?

09:47.570 --> 09:48.832
The world.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.131
All over the world?

09:50.640 --> 09:51.937
The Caribbean, mainly.

09:52.108 --> 09:53.769
Hell, I was pretty much blown out...

09:53.943 --> 09:56.639
...at just about every dive supplier
south of Key West.

09:57.113 --> 09:58.705
- I don't believe this guy.
- Look.

09:58.881 --> 10:01.509
I used the money
to pay off some old debts...

10:01.684 --> 10:04.482
...which, if anything,
should reassure you.

10:05.288 --> 10:09.054
Because now I owe you money,
and you know that I'm good for it.

10:09.792 --> 10:11.191
Huh?

10:12.128 --> 10:14.596
Now, can we talk about the plate?

10:17.099 --> 10:18.828
Come on.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.301
A plate from Howard Johnson's.

10:28.477 --> 10:30.536
It is not a plate
from Howard Johnson's, man.

10:30.713 --> 10:33.807
That's got half the Vangor family crest
stamped on the back of it.

10:33.983 --> 10:36.247
And if you just let me get back
down to my boat...

10:36.419 --> 10:38.683
...all right, before my books rot,
I'll prove it.

10:38.854 --> 10:41.322
Shit look more to me
like half a Arby's logo or something.

10:44.327 --> 10:47.091
Look at the filigree scalloping on the rim.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.893
Do you understand what this means?

10:55.771 --> 10:57.568
Get his embezzling ass off my island.

11:03.479 --> 11:04.946
Fine.

11:05.681 --> 11:07.012
Can I have my shard back?

11:08.117 --> 11:09.880
You ain't gonna need it.

11:11.987 --> 11:13.921
So you do know what it means.

11:15.424 --> 11:17.858
No, no, no, get...

11:19.995 --> 11:22.520
You guys are making a big mistake.

11:22.698 --> 11:27.032
<i>Bigg Bunny is never gonna find
the Aurelia without me.</i>

11:29.905 --> 11:32.897
You ever hear the expression,
"miss by an inch, miss by a mile"?

11:34.477 --> 11:35.774
It's a diving expression.

11:35.945 --> 11:38.778
It means, you miss by an inch,
you miss by a mile.

11:40.182 --> 11:43.345
Now, that wreck could be scattered
over 20 miles, guys.

11:43.886 --> 11:46.320
Any last words?

11:53.629 --> 11:55.062
Yeah.

11:58.167 --> 11:59.691
Tell Tess I love her.

11:59.869 --> 12:01.530
Okay.

12:02.505 --> 12:03.529
Who's Tess?

12:04.140 --> 12:05.835
It's my wife.

12:06.475 --> 12:10.468
At least she will be
till 10:00 tomorrow morning.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.243
She's divorcing me...

12:15.184 --> 12:17.482
...and I still don't know what I did wrong.

12:20.790 --> 12:23.953
Well, brother, you ain't never
gonna find out, neither.

12:24.126 --> 12:26.754
- Let's go.
- Curtis, hold it, help.

12:26.929 --> 12:29.659
Help. Help!

12:32.067 --> 12:33.091
Oh, shit.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.967
Hey.

12:41.811 --> 12:44.780
Hey. Don't move.

12:54.523 --> 12:56.491
Oh, shit.

13:05.334 --> 13:07.063
Whoa. Whoa.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.172
Get him.

13:15.344 --> 13:18.211
Use the boat. Start the engine.

13:21.951 --> 13:23.851
Oh, shit!

13:24.053 --> 13:25.384
Whoo!

13:32.728 --> 13:33.888
Shit.

13:56.485 --> 13:57.645
Shit.

14:31.987 --> 14:35.252
Please, Lord,
don't let me shoot off my foot.

15:12.761 --> 15:14.558
Okay, guys...

15:15.130 --> 15:16.290
...wish me luck.

15:16.465 --> 15:19.662
Good luck, honey.
Don't lose your nerve at the last minute.

15:19.835 --> 15:23.134
She don't need her nerve,
10-to-1 the guy don't even show up.

15:24.807 --> 15:27.071
- Why do you say that?
- Because that's his nature.

15:27.242 --> 15:29.301
- What the hell do you know?
- That's right.

15:29.478 --> 15:32.106
Defend that bastard
and attack your friends who love you.

15:32.281 --> 15:33.441
I've got no feelings.

15:33.616 --> 15:36.312
I'm just saying you don't know
anything about my marriage.

15:36.485 --> 15:38.885
- Well, I heard enough.
- Hmm.

15:39.054 --> 15:41.318
Do I comment on your love life?

15:41.490 --> 15:45.483
You could, if I didn't happen to be
the most fortunate guy in the world.

15:46.228 --> 15:47.252
Get out of here.

15:47.429 --> 15:51.627
I just want you to have the happiness
me and Eddie thank God for every day.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.098
He's not exaggerating, either.
We really do that.

15:54.269 --> 15:56.794
Apparently this makes me
some kind of deranged animal.

15:56.972 --> 15:59.532
You make it sound
like I never meant anything to him.

16:00.142 --> 16:04.044
All I said was the guy has a tendency
to miss a lot of appointments.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.877
Behold this dude.

17:10.045 --> 17:11.603
What's up?

17:11.780 --> 17:14.374
Oh, my God, are you from Cuba?

17:14.550 --> 17:17.951
Lucky for you we happened along,
my most superfluously toasted friend.

17:18.119 --> 17:19.484
Water, water.

17:19.655 --> 17:23.250
It appears that you have run dry
of the sacred nectar.

17:23.425 --> 17:24.517
Oh, yeah.

17:27.362 --> 17:28.852
Yeah.

17:29.031 --> 17:34.094
All hail Neptune,
and those who party on his mighty waves.

17:34.269 --> 17:36.635
- Hail, Neptune. Whoo!
- Hail, Neptune. Whoo!

17:40.375 --> 17:42.104
Decent rescue.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.078
Holy shit.

17:55.090 --> 17:59.424
Go faster. Whoo!

18:01.463 --> 18:02.987
Take a left right here.

18:09.471 --> 18:13.373
I'll give him a few more minutes,
Mr. McCintry...

18:13.909 --> 18:17.310
...but if he's not here by a quarter past...

18:17.479 --> 18:22.712
...l'll be forced to award everything
to Mrs. Finnegan here...

18:22.885 --> 18:24.250
...by default.

18:24.419 --> 18:28.082
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Do you wanna go to prison?

18:28.657 --> 18:30.784
If it gets me out of Florida?

18:31.093 --> 18:34.551
Honey, Florida didn't ruin your life.
You did.

18:34.730 --> 18:39.258
You married a guy for the sex,
and then expected him to be smart.

18:43.405 --> 18:44.702
Aah.

18:45.307 --> 18:46.934
Maybe he had car trouble.

18:47.910 --> 18:49.104
Car trouble?

18:49.278 --> 18:50.711
<i>Yeah. You know...</i>

18:52.114 --> 18:53.138
...car trouble.

18:55.517 --> 18:57.610
He'd have to own a car...

18:58.053 --> 19:01.682
...which he couldn't even if he wanted to
because he has no money.

19:01.857 --> 19:04.655
<i>He has no credit.</i>

19:04.827 --> 19:07.352
He has no clue how to behave
like a responsible adult.

19:07.963 --> 19:08.987
Oh...

19:09.164 --> 19:15.660
Which is why I can't get a loan,
because everything is in our name. Ha-ha.

19:17.639 --> 19:20.335
I can't even pay for school
and finish my degree...

19:20.509 --> 19:22.875
...which is what I was doing
in the first place...

19:23.045 --> 19:25.445
...before I got dragged down here
on spring break.

19:28.183 --> 19:30.811
But like you said, the sex was really...

19:31.854 --> 19:34.254
...really, really great.

19:36.525 --> 19:39.688
Do you have any idea
how humiliating it is...

19:39.862 --> 19:41.762
...to get divorced by yourself?

19:53.876 --> 19:57.812
Your Honor, this is a big mistake.

19:57.980 --> 19:59.709
This woman...

20:00.282 --> 20:03.115
...and I still love each other.

20:04.686 --> 20:06.449
Don't do this, Tess.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.852
Look, I know I messed up, all right?

20:09.024 --> 20:12.050
But I'm willing to change in any area
that you feel needs work.

20:12.227 --> 20:13.660
I wanna make you happy.

20:15.130 --> 20:16.927
I'll do anything.

20:17.866 --> 20:20.562
I'll see a counselor.

20:24.506 --> 20:27.566
Will you come to Chicago with me
like you promised?

20:30.012 --> 20:31.741
Could be... I mean, that could work.

20:33.715 --> 20:35.478
I'll definitely see the counselor.

20:39.221 --> 20:41.655
Mr. Finnegan...

20:42.024 --> 20:45.892
...I can't tell you what a pleasure it is
to inform you that under Florida law...

20:46.495 --> 20:50.397
...you and this woman have been divorced
for the last 50 or 60 seconds.

20:50.565 --> 20:54.558
Moreover, as you were not present
at the time of the proceedings...

20:54.736 --> 20:57.330
...she got everything.

21:03.078 --> 21:04.238
We're divorced?

21:05.047 --> 21:06.480
I'm afraid so.

21:15.557 --> 21:17.422
Why?

21:21.496 --> 21:22.986
Excuse me.

21:31.840 --> 21:34.775
Oh, wait, Tess.
I gotta tell you what happened.

21:35.377 --> 21:36.969
Tess.

21:38.046 --> 21:40.571
We found it. Me and Alfonz.

21:40.749 --> 21:44.981
About a hundred yards off the reef.
Right where we always said she'd be.

21:47.055 --> 21:48.818
Oh...

21:49.191 --> 21:50.818
Prove it.

21:55.464 --> 21:58.228
Excuse me, excuse me,
you have a pen, paper?

21:58.500 --> 22:01.663
Anybody got a pen, pencil,
paper, anything?

22:01.837 --> 22:04.135
Your uselessness is epic.

22:04.306 --> 22:07.537
What does that mean? Here we go.

22:08.643 --> 22:12.010
All right. Alfonz and I are diving...

22:13.315 --> 22:16.751
...and I come across this plate,
dinner plate, about yay big.

22:16.918 --> 22:18.886
It's plain white...

22:19.054 --> 22:20.453
...but this...

22:21.390 --> 22:23.551
...was stamped on the back...

22:24.960 --> 22:26.257
...in blue.

22:27.496 --> 22:30.260
It's the Vangor family crest, Tess.

22:30.432 --> 22:33.765
You were right all along.
You were right before anybody.

22:35.570 --> 22:38.539
- Where did you find this?
- A hundred yards off the reef.

22:41.576 --> 22:43.100
Wow, Finn. Oh, my God.

22:43.278 --> 22:45.109
That's what I'm saying.

22:45.580 --> 22:47.275
Where's the plate?

22:48.683 --> 22:50.742
Well, I don't have it on me
this minute.

22:51.253 --> 22:52.277
Where do you have it?

22:52.454 --> 22:54.388
Well, it's back there.

22:57.025 --> 22:58.686
Wow.

23:00.362 --> 23:01.386
Wow.

23:01.563 --> 23:05.260
I know what you're thinking, Tess.
But I swear to God it's the truth.

23:05.434 --> 23:06.458
You can ask Alfonz.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.626
Okay. Where is he?

23:08.804 --> 23:10.066
Well, he's back there too.

23:10.238 --> 23:12.832
I can't believe you would dangle this
in front of me.

23:13.008 --> 23:15.067
I can't believe it.

23:15.243 --> 23:18.542
- You really think I'd lie about this?
- Why not? You're a liar.

23:18.713 --> 23:21.045
But this is an inappropriate time
to dwell on that.

23:21.216 --> 23:23.184
You... I can draw this picture too.

23:23.351 --> 23:26.912
Hey, Tess, I'm telling you, we solved
a 300-year-old mystery yesterday.

23:27.089 --> 23:28.249
Married or not...

23:28.423 --> 23:32.018
...if we don't go after that ship,
it's gonna haunt us the rest of our lives.

23:32.194 --> 23:34.526
I wasted eight years of my life
on this bullshit.

23:34.696 --> 23:37.358
I'm going back to Chicago.
I'm gonna get my Ph. D...

23:37.532 --> 23:41.332
...and I'm going to spend the rest of my life
teaching, reading and writing books.

23:41.503 --> 23:44.768
And somewhere in there I'm gonna meet
an intelligent, successful man...

23:44.940 --> 23:49.877
...who can get through an entire
conversation without using "definitely."

23:51.813 --> 23:55.874
First of all,
I hardly ever say that anymore.

23:56.451 --> 24:00.410
And when are you gonna stop selling
this crap about going back to school?

24:00.589 --> 24:03.922
You want history?
It's under the ocean, lady.

24:05.127 --> 24:08.392
What, are you telling me you wanna
spend your life in some dark room...

24:08.563 --> 24:10.963
...taking notes and writing books...

24:11.133 --> 24:14.296
...about what some old putz in
another room cooked up in his head...

24:14.469 --> 24:16.903
...about things
that you have actually seen...

24:17.072 --> 24:20.838
...and touched and pulled out of the sand
with your own hands?

24:23.945 --> 24:25.742
Bullshit.

24:28.283 --> 24:30.979
I'm so glad we're not married anymore.

24:37.159 --> 24:40.492
Well, where are you gonna get
the tuition money anyway?

24:40.662 --> 24:43.825
That's the best part. By selling the boat.

24:44.799 --> 24:48.064
By selling my boat, which belongs to me,
which used to belong to us...

24:48.236 --> 24:50.704
...but you missed the divorce
so now it belongs to me.

24:51.273 --> 24:54.333
I'm gonna fix it up, I'm gonna sell it,
and I'm going back... What?

24:54.509 --> 24:55.635
This is hard to say.

24:55.810 --> 24:57.437
What is?

25:15.397 --> 25:17.922
Well, you act like this is totally my fault.

25:18.867 --> 25:21.597
Can I borrow this cane
for a second, please?

25:21.770 --> 25:23.499
Oh, come on, Tess.
You're not gonna hit me.

25:23.672 --> 25:24.934
Ugh.

25:28.743 --> 25:30.370
Sorry.

26:02.644 --> 26:04.509
Oh, my God.

26:06.214 --> 26:07.875
Oh, my God.

26:09.117 --> 26:10.516
Oh, God.

26:39.080 --> 26:41.605
I take it they didn't kill you.

26:45.620 --> 26:46.985
No...

26:47.555 --> 26:49.284
...but thanks for your help.

26:49.924 --> 26:52.324
- You need help.
- You are not my mother.

26:52.494 --> 26:53.518
You're right.

26:53.695 --> 26:57.131
I guess maybe I act like your mother
sometimes because I never had one.

26:57.299 --> 26:58.357
Easy, Gary, easy.

26:58.533 --> 27:01.468
Okay, look, the main thing is
we get away from Key West.

27:01.636 --> 27:05.470
The second Finn lays eyes on this boat,
he's gonna be onboard in 10 minutes.

27:05.640 --> 27:08.074
What do you mean?
You told him you're working here?

27:08.243 --> 27:10.473
- Are you kidding?
- Then I don't get it.

27:11.046 --> 27:13.139
He needs money, Gary.

27:13.348 --> 27:16.283
Another boat, new equipment, everything.

27:16.451 --> 27:19.682
And I doubt he's gonna squeeze
another dime out of that Bugs Bunny.

27:19.854 --> 27:23.051
- Bugs Bunny?
- The rapper guy we had the fight about.

27:23.224 --> 27:25.021
- You mean Bigg Bunny Deenz?
- Yeah.

27:25.193 --> 27:27.991
- Bigg Bunny Deenz is Finn's investor?
- Yeah.

27:28.163 --> 27:31.257
- Hey, Gary?
- He is a very dangerous guy.

27:31.433 --> 27:33.799
I did like that one song he had,
"Call Me Thumper."

27:33.968 --> 27:35.162
That was some funny shit.

27:35.337 --> 27:37.635
- Anyway...
- There's something wrong with my bisque.

27:37.806 --> 27:39.205
- I'm sorry, honey.
- Anyway...

27:39.374 --> 27:42.104
But I don't get it,
because has Finn ever even met Nigel?

27:42.277 --> 27:44.939
No. But he will, don't you understand?

27:45.113 --> 27:47.809
He is a genius at exactly three things:

27:47.982 --> 27:53.420
Treasure salving, finding money
for treasure salving, and one other thing.

27:55.390 --> 27:57.324
- What other thing?
- What other thing?

27:59.060 --> 28:00.721
I don't wanna talk about it.

28:00.895 --> 28:03.022
How do you plan to get another boat?

28:03.198 --> 28:06.463
I can't think about this right now, Alfonz.

28:07.635 --> 28:09.068
I just got divorced.

28:10.238 --> 28:12.433
May I make a suggestion?

28:13.575 --> 28:14.974
No.

28:16.411 --> 28:18.709
You see that big yacht lying offshore?

28:19.347 --> 28:20.371
No, which one?

28:20.548 --> 28:23.381
The owner is Nigel Honeycutt.

28:24.686 --> 28:26.278
- So what?
- I only mention it...

28:26.454 --> 28:31.790
...because he is worth $ 700 million.

28:33.928 --> 28:37.625
And just to let you know,
I'm back onboard, obviously.

28:38.032 --> 28:40.592
So whenever you want to weigh anchor
is great.

28:41.369 --> 28:42.836
Thank you.

28:43.505 --> 28:45.370
So should I tell the captain?

28:45.540 --> 28:47.667
Ready to weigh anchor?
Ready to push off?

28:48.777 --> 28:50.506
Actually, no.

28:50.678 --> 28:53.806
My daughter, Gemma, is joining us today...

28:53.982 --> 28:55.973
...and I said I would wait here for her.

28:56.151 --> 28:58.619
Oh, great. God.

28:59.521 --> 29:01.614
When is she coming?
Where is she coming from?

29:01.790 --> 29:03.815
How far away is she? How great.

29:04.225 --> 29:06.386
I sent the chopper to Miami...

29:07.028 --> 29:09.496
...but she could be anywhere.

29:09.664 --> 29:13.156
That's so funny that you would wait
in Key West for her...

29:13.334 --> 29:16.064
...when she's coming by chopper.

29:16.237 --> 29:18.296
- Is it?
- Well, just because the helicopter...

29:18.473 --> 29:20.202
...could just meet the boat anywhere.

29:20.375 --> 29:24.607
I mean, anywhere at all, that's what's
so incredibly great about helicopters.

29:25.613 --> 29:28.138
She wants to do some shopping.

29:34.956 --> 29:36.446
What do you do, Tess?

29:38.626 --> 29:41.026
I'm the new steward.

29:42.230 --> 29:44.027
But what do you really do?

29:44.199 --> 29:48.465
What makes you think I do anything
besides stewarding?

29:48.636 --> 29:52.834
Stewing, stewarding,
stewarding? Stewarding.

29:53.007 --> 29:57.706
My infallible lifelong instinct
for sizing people up.

30:00.448 --> 30:01.813
Have you sized me up?

30:02.984 --> 30:04.576
Not quite.

30:06.154 --> 30:10.318
You don't mind the work,
but you're not here for long.

30:10.825 --> 30:15.990
You have a deep but not entirely unclouded
love for the sea.

30:16.998 --> 30:20.126
You perform your duties
with superlative efficiency and ease...

30:20.301 --> 30:23.099
...suggestive of someone expending
approximately one-tenth...

30:23.271 --> 30:25.136
...of her available brain power.

30:26.441 --> 30:27.874
So...

30:28.676 --> 30:31.440
...what do you do
with the remaining 90 percent...

30:31.613 --> 30:33.547
...when you're not getting divorced?

30:37.151 --> 30:39.381
I hope I'm not being too personal.

30:42.223 --> 30:46.057
No, not at... Not at all.

30:49.831 --> 30:53.358
It's just been a crazy couple of years.

30:57.472 --> 30:58.871
It's probably his helicopter.

30:59.040 --> 31:01.167
His daughter
is supposed to be arriving today.

31:01.342 --> 31:04.072
The whole town is buzzing
with excitement.

31:22.597 --> 31:26.431
Hey, so where you say
this, uh, museum is at?

31:28.102 --> 31:30.332
Number 2, Water Street.

31:30.505 --> 31:34.032
Okay, uh, every street on this island
is called Water Street.

31:34.208 --> 31:36.938
This place has a magic atmosphere.

31:37.111 --> 31:39.079
Will you just find
the damn address, man?

31:39.247 --> 31:41.772
Yo, Cordell, we got MapQuest
on these things?

32:23.958 --> 32:26.324
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hello, darling.

32:28.930 --> 32:30.830
Hello, my baby.

32:30.999 --> 32:32.694
Daddy.

32:38.106 --> 32:40.870
- Pleasant flight?
- Uh-huh.

32:41.943 --> 32:44.810
So, um, is this the whole boat?

32:46.547 --> 32:50.210
- Yes.
- Oh, so cute.

32:50.385 --> 32:52.717
I can't believe we're at sea.

32:52.887 --> 32:56.050
Well, uh, technically, we're at anchor.

32:56.224 --> 33:02.163
Oh, wait, okay. So that just means
that the anchor is in the water, right?

33:03.064 --> 33:04.361
- Yes.
- Yes.

33:04.532 --> 33:07.933
Okay. Because I totally wanna learn
all the sea terms.

33:08.102 --> 33:09.933
And so you shall, my darling.

33:10.104 --> 33:13.335
Okay, let me try again.
Excuse me, Nigel.

33:13.508 --> 33:15.874
Yes, my dear.

33:16.544 --> 33:18.603
You know what,
let's not do the accent thing.

33:18.813 --> 33:20.337
It's no good?

33:22.050 --> 33:23.813
It's fine.

33:24.085 --> 33:26.212
Um... Anyway...

33:26.387 --> 33:31.222
Nigel, remember when you asked me
this afternoon what I really did?

33:45.606 --> 33:46.903
Have fun shopping.

33:47.075 --> 33:48.702
Thank you, Daddy.

33:48.876 --> 33:51.344
Do try to keep it
under 50 thousand.

33:52.146 --> 33:53.170
What? Ha.

33:54.982 --> 33:56.176
Supper's at 7.

33:56.350 --> 34:00.047
I was supposed to meet some friends,
but I'm gonna try to get out of it.

34:00.221 --> 34:02.485
Invite them aboard if you like.
Just let me know.

34:02.657 --> 34:04.682
Okay, I will. Love you.

34:24.045 --> 34:25.376
My hat.

34:33.654 --> 34:36.554
Hey, look. The hat, he is a Frisbee.

34:36.724 --> 34:38.885
Can you turn the boat around?
Thank you.

34:39.060 --> 34:41.688
Okay, but we never gonna catch him.

35:05.987 --> 35:07.284
Whoa!

35:10.458 --> 35:11.482
God.

35:15.630 --> 35:17.097
- Oh, shit.
- Oh.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.128
Oh, my God. You killed him.

35:22.970 --> 35:25.165
Ow. Ow. Ow.

35:30.344 --> 35:31.971
What in God's name happened?

35:32.580 --> 35:35.606
Daddy, this man saved my life.

35:35.783 --> 35:37.444
Sir, sir...

35:37.885 --> 35:40.979
...I really don't think you should get up
until I make sure...

35:50.998 --> 35:53.159
Is this your hat?

35:53.835 --> 35:54.995
Yes. Ha-ha.

35:56.204 --> 36:01.801
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

36:03.311 --> 36:07.645
Sir, thank you so much.

36:07.815 --> 36:08.839
Thank you.

36:09.016 --> 36:10.711
- Thank you, indeed.
- He'll be okay.

36:10.885 --> 36:12.785
Just a little bump on the head.

36:12.954 --> 36:16.515
Just try not to move around too much
for the next few hours.

36:17.225 --> 36:21.355
- But I gotta go back to town.
- Oh, I really don't advise it.

36:21.729 --> 36:22.923
Oh...

36:23.164 --> 36:24.461
Now what am I gonna do?

36:25.333 --> 36:26.425
Uh...

36:26.601 --> 36:30.833
May I suggest a hot shower,
some clean clothes...

36:31.005 --> 36:32.302
...and cocktails at 6:30?

36:32.907 --> 36:36.070
Okay. Thanks.

36:37.345 --> 36:39.745
Take him to the Saint Regis.

36:41.515 --> 36:46.009
Whoa, whoa.
Yep, yep, yep, I'm good. I'm good.

36:47.355 --> 36:48.913
Hey, Mr. Honeycutt?

36:49.090 --> 36:52.753
Miss Honeycutt,
she leave him on the boat.

36:52.927 --> 36:56.556
Gemma. Your lifeline
to civilization, darling.

36:59.233 --> 37:00.791
Oh.

37:01.102 --> 37:04.003
Oh, my God, I would have been so dead.

37:04.171 --> 37:06.139
Here you are, darling.

37:13.814 --> 37:18.274
Well, Mr. Deenz, I'm always delighted
to welcome an entrant into my field...

37:18.452 --> 37:20.784
...whether it be on land or sea.

37:21.355 --> 37:24.119
But I feel I need to warn you.

37:24.425 --> 37:26.552
There's no way
of getting away from treasure...

37:26.727 --> 37:29.389
...once it's fastened itself on your mind.

37:29.563 --> 37:32.054
I want you to find me the Queen's Dowry.

37:32.233 --> 37:33.564
Heh.

37:33.734 --> 37:37.602
- Well, now, Bunny, uh...
- Bigg Bunny. It's one word.

37:40.107 --> 37:42.735
Well, that's an emerald
of a different color, isn't it?

37:43.411 --> 37:45.038
Cordell.

37:51.786 --> 37:55.517
This is a piece of the plate
that we found in the Bahamas...

37:55.690 --> 37:59.490
...off of Topsail Cay.
Now, if you turn it over...

37:59.660 --> 38:03.118
...you may notice that it has
the Vangor family crest stamped on it.

38:03.297 --> 38:05.231
That's what that is right there.

38:06.968 --> 38:08.230
That's very nice, uh...

38:10.171 --> 38:12.264
...but who the hell are the Vangors...

38:12.440 --> 38:16.274
...and why the hell should I give
a rat's ass about their family crest?

38:21.349 --> 38:25.115
It's not an investment, per se,
because you probably won't see a dime...

38:25.286 --> 38:28.084
...but it's a chance to pull out
a piece of living history...

38:28.255 --> 38:31.088
...from the sand
with your own two hands.

38:34.362 --> 38:35.522
<i>To the Aurelia.</i>

38:39.000 --> 38:40.467
Hey, babe.

38:41.168 --> 38:42.396
What are you doing here?

38:42.570 --> 38:44.162
Have a good dinner.

38:45.706 --> 38:47.765
<i>Bon appétit, everybody.</i>

38:48.976 --> 38:50.000
Ugh!

38:54.715 --> 38:56.444
I take it you've met.

38:56.917 --> 39:02.048
So Tess and I first hooked up when
we worked for this cat named Moe Fitch.

39:02.223 --> 39:05.989
He's kind of a local character, you know,
big talker, lot of tall tales...

39:06.160 --> 39:07.559
...a lovable, old sea dog.

39:07.728 --> 39:11.391
- You should live to be so eccentric.
- Ooh...

39:11.565 --> 39:12.964
Thank you, babe.

39:13.134 --> 39:15.034
I do wish you would sit down.

39:15.636 --> 39:19.299
Moe Fitch is the most respected and
successful treasure salvor in the world.

39:19.473 --> 39:21.532
- Nobody said he wasn't.
- When Finn met Moe...

39:21.709 --> 39:23.904
...he was repairing outboards
and lawn mowers...

39:24.078 --> 39:26.546
...during the brief intervals
he wasn't getting fired.

39:26.714 --> 39:28.614
Two times, Tess. I got fired two times.

39:28.783 --> 39:30.648
I'll be off in one second.

39:31.085 --> 39:34.020
Moe picked him out of a puddle
of motor oil and suntan lotion...

39:34.188 --> 39:38.420
...gave him a job, a vocation,
taught him everything he knows.

39:40.594 --> 39:42.289
Almost.

39:43.798 --> 39:47.234
Anyway, then they had a tremendous
falling-out over this cannon we found...

39:47.401 --> 39:49.164
On our day off.

39:49.336 --> 39:52.430
<i>From the Aurelia,
three miles east of Vero Beach.</i>

39:52.606 --> 39:56.133
Which the court ruled was Moe's,
because we borrowed his equipment.

39:57.912 --> 40:00.380
The sea is all attached, right?

40:00.714 --> 40:02.545
To what, darling?

40:02.716 --> 40:05.276
Kerry and Vivante
grabbed a plane for the Yucatán...

40:05.453 --> 40:07.683
...and I thought
we could hook up with them...

40:07.855 --> 40:10.722
...instead of just sailing around
doing nothing.

40:12.827 --> 40:14.761
Tell us about the treasure.

40:21.202 --> 40:24.694
July 31 st, 1715.

40:24.872 --> 40:28.638
A hurricane sinks the entire Spanish
treasure fleet off the coast of Florida...

40:28.809 --> 40:31.300
<i>...including her flagship, the Capitana...</i>

40:31.479 --> 40:35.575
...which, according to its manifest,
carried the Queen's Dowry.

40:35.749 --> 40:39.116
Forty chests
of jewelry and gold crowns...

40:39.286 --> 40:42.312
...especially crafted in the Orient
for the new queen of Spain.

40:42.490 --> 40:44.958
When we say jewels, we mean...

40:45.126 --> 40:51.031
...lndian diamonds, Burmese rubies and
Colombian emeralds the size of your fist.

40:51.198 --> 40:55.032
We should probably start with what Tess
and I got excited about on our honeymoon.

40:55.202 --> 40:57.261
Well, I think we can all guess.

40:59.273 --> 41:01.298
After we lost the court case...

41:01.475 --> 41:04.205
...we decided to go backpacking in Spain
for two weeks.

41:05.146 --> 41:09.276
Ended up spending two years
in the Archives of the Indies in Seville.

41:09.450 --> 41:11.645
You spent your honeymoon in a library?

41:12.086 --> 41:13.348
<i>Okay.</i>

41:16.157 --> 41:18.990
I love you.
Oh, baby, I love you too.

41:19.160 --> 41:22.857
Where every known record,
official transcript and royal decree...

41:23.030 --> 41:25.498
...relating to the fleets
has been kept for centuries.

41:25.666 --> 41:28.897
<i>At first it was for fun, but then
we decided to look up the Aurelia...</i>

41:29.069 --> 41:32.766
...because of the cannon we'd found in
Florida, and it became our pet project.

41:32.940 --> 41:37.377
Especially when we learned the captain was
an 18-year-old kid named Sebastian Vangor.

41:37.545 --> 41:40.309
Who we also discovered
was the illegitimate son...

41:40.481 --> 41:43.917
<i>...of Captain General Don Juan Ubilla
of the Capitana...</i>

41:44.084 --> 41:47.247
...and his Mexican mistress,
Francesca Vangor.

41:47.421 --> 41:51.289
We thought it was an interesting sidebar
and really didn't think much more of it...

41:51.458 --> 41:57.488
...until Tess found this very obscure
Spanish book published in 1905...

41:57.665 --> 42:01.157
<i>...titled, The Vangors:
an 18th Century Family.</i>

42:01.335 --> 42:04.099
- It was a collection of letters.
- So why is this important?

42:04.271 --> 42:08.708
Because the Vangors controlled
the mule train that transported the Dowry...

42:08.876 --> 42:11.538
...over the mountains
from the Pacific to the Caribbean...

42:11.712 --> 42:14.681
...and then loaded it onto Spanish galleons
here in Veracruz.

42:14.848 --> 42:18.249
So I'm reading this, and all
of a sudden I start hyperventilating...

42:18.419 --> 42:22.856
...because there it is right in front of me
in Ubilla's last letter to Francesca.

42:23.023 --> 42:24.650
He wrote:

42:24.992 --> 42:28.450
<i>"My faith in the Aurelia
is that she is swift and light...</i>

42:28.629 --> 42:31.530
...and can outrun the storms
we will most certainly encounter.

42:31.699 --> 42:35.396
But it is my faith in Sebastian
that knows no bounds.

42:35.569 --> 42:39.335
Our son is good and strong
and wiser than this old fool...

42:39.506 --> 42:42.441
...who leaves your bed
more and more reluctantly.

42:42.610 --> 42:48.344
The glory of the Spanish Crown
rests in his capable hands."

42:50.517 --> 42:52.041
So...

42:53.087 --> 42:54.384
...Ubilla pulled a switch.

42:54.555 --> 42:56.045
Mm.
- With the Vangors' help.

42:56.790 --> 43:02.194
<i>And moved the Queen's Dowry
from the Capitana to the supply ship.</i>

43:02.363 --> 43:03.387
Because?

43:03.564 --> 43:05.725
<i>The Capitana
was already way overloaded...</i>

43:05.899 --> 43:08.367
...so it was very heavy and very slow.

43:08.535 --> 43:10.799
It wasn't just hurricanes
they had to worry about.

43:10.971 --> 43:13.269
British warships,
French privateers, you name it.

43:13.440 --> 43:16.841
About the time Finn and I were ready
to leave, we found this article...

43:17.011 --> 43:20.640
...about a Spanish sailor
who was rescued off a deserted island...

43:20.814 --> 43:22.907
...after being shipwrecked for three years.

43:23.083 --> 43:24.277
Off Topsail Cay?

43:24.451 --> 43:27.682
- Right. 1718.
- Three years after the hurricane.

43:27.855 --> 43:31.621
A Dutch frigate had come to grief
on the shoals off of Topsail Cay...

43:31.792 --> 43:34.260
...and while waiting for the tide to rise...

43:34.428 --> 43:37.488
...they saw what they thought
was an old man paddling out on a log.

43:37.665 --> 43:41.260
Only he wasn't an old man.
He was 21 years old.

43:41.435 --> 43:44.461
Looked like Tom Hanks in that movie.
What was that movie?

43:44.638 --> 43:45.662
Um...

43:47.207 --> 43:48.765
<i>- Cast Away.
- Ha-ha.</i>

43:48.942 --> 43:50.034
- Yes.
- Ha-ha.

43:50.210 --> 43:53.976
He told the Dutch captain
his name was Raphael Serrano...

43:54.148 --> 43:56.639
<i>...of the tobacco ship Francesca.</i>

43:56.850 --> 43:59.250
Ha. As in mother of Sebastian.

43:59.420 --> 44:00.512
- Yes.
- Exactly.

44:01.121 --> 44:02.486
Now, he said...

44:02.656 --> 44:06.148
...he had struck the same reef
and sunk in just 30 feet of water.

44:06.660 --> 44:08.059
Wow.

44:08.228 --> 44:10.196
You guys must really like treasure.

44:10.898 --> 44:14.356
Yes. I mean, it's very impressive...

44:14.535 --> 44:17.402
...but it's still thin.

44:17.571 --> 44:20.802
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Only Francesca...</i>

44:21.642 --> 44:23.633
...she didn't sink off Topsail Cay.

44:24.845 --> 44:28.178
She sank off the coast of Veracruz
in 1708...

44:28.349 --> 44:31.944
...with all hands,
including her captain, Raphael Serrano.

44:32.486 --> 44:34.386
- Wait, I don't get it.
- Neither did we.

44:34.555 --> 44:38.992
<i>Until we discovered the Francesca
had been owned by the Vangor family.</i>

44:40.761 --> 44:42.023
Yeah.

44:42.196 --> 44:46.462
So, what do we know
about Sebastian Vangor?

44:48.902 --> 44:52.963
Well, we know for a fact that
he survived a hurricane, a shipwreck...

44:53.140 --> 44:57.133
...starvation, pirates, most likely,
and then he lied about it.

44:58.345 --> 45:02.247
Now, why lie about being part
of the greatest treasure fleet in history?

45:03.650 --> 45:06.084
Unless you're sitting on top
of a huge secret.

45:06.253 --> 45:10.815
A secret that nobody, not even
the king of Spain, knew existed.

45:12.092 --> 45:14.560
Well, I can think of only one reason:

45:15.763 --> 45:17.025
Honor.

45:18.532 --> 45:20.523
Because his father had entrusted him...

45:20.701 --> 45:22.896
...with precious gifts
mankind had never seen...

45:23.070 --> 45:27.507
...he had to survive
to fulfill the privilege...

45:27.674 --> 45:30.370
...Ubilla had bestowed on him
that fateful day in Veracruz.

45:30.544 --> 45:31.602
That's why he lied.

45:35.449 --> 45:37.679
That's why he lived.

45:38.585 --> 45:40.576
And that's why we can't give up.

45:44.725 --> 45:48.889
Sebastian Vangor is the unsung hero
of an entire nation...

45:49.062 --> 45:51.053
...and we intend to prove it.

45:51.698 --> 45:54.929
- So, what happened to him?
- Sebastian?

45:55.436 --> 45:57.631
He was taken off the Dutch ship
in Martinique...

45:57.805 --> 46:00.569
...and died a week later of consumption.
- Oh...

46:00.741 --> 46:02.265
He drank too much?

46:03.377 --> 46:07.814
No. Um... Consumption, darling.
As in tuberculosis.

46:07.981 --> 46:12.247
Not to be confused with consuming,
as in guzzling.

46:12.419 --> 46:15.388
Oh, man. I'm so dumb.

46:15.589 --> 46:17.614
Huh. You wanna hear dumb?

46:17.791 --> 46:22.751
I used to think that it meant he died
having sex, as in consummating.

46:23.530 --> 46:25.225
- You did?
- Yeah.

46:25.399 --> 46:26.559
You did?

46:26.767 --> 46:28.291
Yeah.

46:28.802 --> 46:31.066
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

46:34.408 --> 46:38.071
Anyway, that's our idea.

46:38.245 --> 46:41.737
It's Tess' mostly, she was always
the brains of the operation.

46:43.617 --> 46:47.519
Well, Gemma? What do you think?

46:47.688 --> 46:49.315
You're asking me?

46:49.490 --> 46:50.514
I am.

46:50.691 --> 46:53.524
A treasure hunt in the Bahamas?

46:53.694 --> 46:57.994
Or a month with Kerry and Vivante
in the Yucatán?

47:04.438 --> 47:06.167
Will you teach me how to dive?

47:08.108 --> 47:09.632
Yes, I will.

47:10.978 --> 47:12.502
- Tess.
- Hey, Alfonz.

47:13.313 --> 47:15.747
- Long time.
- This is Mr. Nigel Honeycutt. Alfonz.

47:15.916 --> 47:17.315
Welcome aboard.

47:17.484 --> 47:19.384
This is Gemma Honeycutt. Alfonz.

47:19.553 --> 47:21.453
Pleased to meet you.

47:38.505 --> 47:39.699
Like that.

47:40.307 --> 47:42.070
- There you go.
- Thank you.

47:42.543 --> 47:45.273
And... Whoa.

47:59.526 --> 48:01.357
Okay. Okay.

48:10.003 --> 48:12.062
Now, the island is basically triangular.

48:12.239 --> 48:14.833
You got cliffs and breakers,
harbor and town, and beach.

48:15.008 --> 48:18.102
Now, I found the plate near the reef
just on the other side.

48:18.278 --> 48:20.803
But you haven't got
the exact coordinates?

48:20.981 --> 48:23.506
The exact position
of the find is irrelevant.

48:23.684 --> 48:26.915
- Why?
- We, uh, kind of left a marker.

48:27.087 --> 48:30.056
We set the boat on fire,
and then we sank it.

48:30.223 --> 48:33.090
- But we would never do that to your boat.
- Nope, just my boat.

48:33.260 --> 48:34.557
- Our boat.
- My boat.

48:34.728 --> 48:36.059
- Our boat.
- My boat.

48:36.229 --> 48:41.223
Hey, did you know that this entire island
is owned by Bigg Bunny Deenz?

48:41.702 --> 48:44.262
- Who?
- He owns the whole island?

48:46.440 --> 48:48.931
Bigg Bunny Deenz.

48:49.109 --> 48:50.906
Oh, yes, I remember.

48:51.078 --> 48:55.208
Didn't he murder someone
named Fuzzy Dice...

48:55.382 --> 48:57.009
...or Pogo Stick or something?

48:57.184 --> 48:59.584
His name was Exta-C.

48:59.753 --> 49:01.311
You're really close.

49:01.488 --> 49:02.955
And he was totally acquitted.

49:03.123 --> 49:07.787
Well, it was difficult to secure a conviction
because he murdered all the witnesses.

49:07.961 --> 49:10.395
You are really incredible, Finn.

49:10.564 --> 49:14.364
Okay, so he owns the island. So what?
He doesn't own the water.

49:14.534 --> 49:17.970
And how's he gonna feel when we're
hauling treasure up out of the water...

49:18.138 --> 49:20.106
...in front of his beach house?

49:20.874 --> 49:24.469
- Supportive?
- I told you not to get involved with him.

49:24.645 --> 49:28.342
What if we need food or fuel
or flashlight batteries?

49:28.515 --> 49:30.312
Will you relax, Tess?

49:32.019 --> 49:33.577
<i>It's Aurelia.</i>

49:35.889 --> 49:39.518
She's right around the corner,
and she's all ours.

49:49.236 --> 49:51.500
Hey, guys.
Come look at this boat.

49:51.672 --> 49:57.133
It's got these really big, um, tubes
going in the water off the back.

50:06.253 --> 50:08.187
Is that where you found the plate?

50:17.597 --> 50:19.394
Man, oh, man.

50:19.566 --> 50:25.129
Anybody but me wanna spend
a weekend in Paris with that boat?

50:25.305 --> 50:28.433
- I think she's already taken.
- What?

50:34.848 --> 50:36.816
Oh, you son of a...

50:36.983 --> 50:38.007
Bitch.

50:38.185 --> 50:39.709
- What's the matter?
- It's Moe.

50:39.886 --> 50:41.353
- What?
- What is it?

50:45.092 --> 50:47.754
What's happened?
- I'm pretty sure hell just froze over.

50:48.495 --> 50:51.191
Well, don't that just beat all.

50:52.733 --> 50:55.497
<i>The Aurelia's mine, goddamn it.</i>

50:55.669 --> 50:57.603
Not if I find her first.

51:00.340 --> 51:02.331
Looks like he's only been here
a day or two.

51:02.509 --> 51:05.205
- How can you tell?
- It's a full day's work to lay the grid.

51:05.378 --> 51:07.312
But... So, what are they looking for?

51:07.481 --> 51:10.006
Do you really not know
the answer to that?

51:15.422 --> 51:16.684
Darling.

51:18.391 --> 51:19.585
Huh.

51:19.760 --> 51:21.489
Oh...

51:21.728 --> 51:24.663
- I will go comfort her.
- No, you stay there.

51:24.831 --> 51:26.458
I'm sorry, but she's gotta learn...

51:26.633 --> 51:29.625
...there's better ways to get attention
than acting like a bimbo.

51:29.803 --> 51:31.464
Like what?

51:58.632 --> 52:00.463
Ahoy there. Good morning.

52:00.634 --> 52:04.161
Morning to you.
That's quite a bucket you got there.

52:04.337 --> 52:05.361
Hello, Moe.

52:07.407 --> 52:09.534
- Hey, darling.
- Small world, huh?

52:09.709 --> 52:11.768
Where's that good-for-nothing husband?

52:11.945 --> 52:14.311
- Ex-husband.
- Congratulations.

52:33.567 --> 52:35.626
Find anything yet, Mr. Fitch?

52:35.802 --> 52:39.135
Well, sir, we're just gonna set
off some charges and take a look.

52:39.306 --> 52:43.766
You might wanna ease back a ways just
in case we accidentally scratch your finish.

52:43.944 --> 52:45.241
I'll tell the captain.

52:45.412 --> 52:47.642
Let's blow some holes.

52:49.449 --> 52:51.940
Come on.
I'm getting old, let's find some gold.

53:02.562 --> 53:03.654
Oh, my God.

53:04.164 --> 53:06.394
- What?
- Delay, delay.

53:06.566 --> 53:08.397
Uh, excuse me, Moe?

53:09.069 --> 53:14.097
Well, well, well.
If it isn't the Ukrainian sidekick.

53:14.274 --> 53:17.038
I don't think of myself that way.

53:17.210 --> 53:21.510
I am the lead character in my own story.
Ha.

53:21.848 --> 53:26.444
But why does everyone I know think
I'm hot except the ones on this boat?

53:26.620 --> 53:27.917
We think you're hot.

53:28.088 --> 53:29.715
- Are you kidding me?
- I know I do.

53:29.890 --> 53:32.085
Gemma. I need your help.
No time to explain.

53:32.259 --> 53:36.093
What do you want?
Some expert advice on how to be stupid?

53:37.797 --> 53:38.821
Oh...

53:38.999 --> 53:41.900
Look. See how dumb they are?

53:43.937 --> 53:45.029
Yeah.

53:45.205 --> 53:48.732
They can't help it. You can. The end.

53:48.909 --> 53:50.001
Let's go.

53:57.484 --> 53:58.974
- Okay.
- Okay, you're on.

53:59.152 --> 54:00.676
- Okay.
- All right, go, go, go.

54:04.791 --> 54:05.917
Hi.

54:06.293 --> 54:08.761
Hi. I'm Gemma.

54:08.929 --> 54:10.658
Hi.

54:10.830 --> 54:12.195
Hey. Hey, hey.

54:15.302 --> 54:17.133
- It's Gemma Honeycutt.
- Are you serious?

54:17.304 --> 54:18.362
It's Gemma Honeycutt.

54:18.538 --> 54:22.634
- Hi. What are your names? Oh.
- I'm Happy.

54:22.809 --> 54:25.073
- I'm Jim.
- Hi.

54:25.245 --> 54:27.338
- Hi.
- Petruchio, eh.

54:27.514 --> 54:30.415
So did you all grow up on this boat?

54:30.817 --> 54:33.809
- Oh! Oh, my God, there's Finn.
- Gemma.

54:37.123 --> 54:40.456
Goddamn bastard. I'll get
that little shit out of there myself.

54:44.931 --> 54:46.398
What, are you crazy, Moe?

54:49.569 --> 54:53.061
Who the hell set off that charge?
There's a man down there.

54:53.239 --> 54:54.900
- What the hell?
- Right over here.

54:55.075 --> 54:57.134
He ripped up the grid.
Nobody rips the grid.

54:57.310 --> 54:59.938
Anybody gonna kill that boy,
it's gonna be me.

55:00.113 --> 55:01.512
Okay.

55:20.400 --> 55:22.061
Finn?

55:27.107 --> 55:29.166
- Hey, honey.
- Ha-ha-ha!

55:29.342 --> 55:32.106
- You go, girl.
- I'll be right over.

55:32.278 --> 55:33.472
Hey.

55:33.646 --> 55:36.513
Bravo. Bravo.

55:36.683 --> 55:39.481
Oh, shit.

55:42.489 --> 55:44.582
Oh, hello, Moe.

55:45.125 --> 55:47.855
Hello, Finn. Anything broke?

55:48.728 --> 55:51.561
- I don't think so.
- Good.

55:53.366 --> 55:56.267
- Finn!
- Finn! Oh!

55:58.238 --> 55:59.899
Is that all you got, old man?

56:02.409 --> 56:05.708
It's difficult to maintain enthusiasm
for your leadership...

56:05.879 --> 56:09.838
...when you keep getting beat up
by that old man.

56:10.016 --> 56:12.814
He's 56 years old.

56:13.019 --> 56:14.247
I can't hit him.

56:14.421 --> 56:16.685
That's quite obvious.

56:21.694 --> 56:26.256
Was that a yellow and white
Cessna 206 seaplane?

56:26.433 --> 56:30.767
I would describe it more
as banana and cream.

56:30.937 --> 56:34.930
I still can't get over the way
he just came up out of the water like that.

56:35.108 --> 56:36.803
I know, and holding the sword.

56:36.976 --> 56:39.308
And then he just makes
this totally perfect toss...

56:39.479 --> 56:42.141
...and the sword ends up sticking
straight up in the deck.

56:42.315 --> 56:43.942
Amazing.

56:44.117 --> 56:48.781
But it's more than just the sheer power
of his raw sexuality.

56:48.955 --> 56:52.948
It's a totality of his emotional commitment
to the task at hand.

56:53.126 --> 56:55.060
Yeah, it's the focus. It's the focus.

56:55.228 --> 56:57.093
He sees it. He wants it.

56:57.564 --> 57:00.931
- He goes after it. He gets it.
- He sure got me.

57:01.101 --> 57:02.625
Do you mind?

57:03.703 --> 57:05.830
- I'm sorry.
- We're sorry.

57:11.311 --> 57:12.608
Well...

57:12.779 --> 57:16.909
Here's to a wonderfully exciting first day...

57:17.083 --> 57:21.042
...and to the safe landing
of our glorious leader.

57:21.888 --> 57:25.915
Hear, says I. Hear, hear, Nigel.
You the man.

57:27.594 --> 57:29.152
No, he meant you, stupid.

57:29.829 --> 57:30.853
What?

57:31.030 --> 57:33.498
- No, Finn, honey, Finn.
- Oh.

57:33.666 --> 57:36.567
There's port in the salon
if anyone's interested...

57:36.736 --> 57:38.636
...and a wonderful selection of cigars...

57:38.805 --> 57:42.263
...if anyone feels like
ruining the evening for the rest of us...

57:42.442 --> 57:43.739
...and cupcakes.

57:43.910 --> 57:45.468
Are there any prostitutes?

57:48.381 --> 57:50.576
Sorry. No.

57:50.750 --> 57:52.445
Well, maybe we can call some.

57:53.553 --> 57:55.487
Oh. My God, are you serious?

57:56.489 --> 57:59.287
Pay him no attention, Gemma,
he's a provocateur.

57:59.459 --> 58:03.190
Okay, but we're not in France right now,
we're in America.

58:07.333 --> 58:09.893
- Think I'm gonna head to bed.
- That's it for me tonight.

58:12.105 --> 58:15.302
A coincidence that we got up together,
and we're both going to bed...

58:15.475 --> 58:18.137
...because we're not going
to bed together.

58:18.311 --> 58:19.335
- Obviously.
- No.

58:19.512 --> 58:21.707
Well, it's really none of our business.

58:21.881 --> 58:23.781
Or even interesting.

58:23.950 --> 58:25.781
- What she's trying to say...
- Good night.

58:25.952 --> 58:27.385
Good night.

58:29.122 --> 58:30.248
Good night.

58:30.623 --> 58:33.319
Nigel, great day.
Gemma, sweet dreams.

58:39.966 --> 58:43.163
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Tess.

58:47.874 --> 58:49.535
I hope...

58:50.743 --> 58:52.472
I hope, Gemma...

58:53.813 --> 58:57.772
...it hasn't been too dull for you here.

58:57.951 --> 59:01.478
Of course not, Daddy.
It's been really fun.

59:01.654 --> 59:03.315
Yes.

59:06.292 --> 59:07.782
Do you still play gin rummy?

59:07.961 --> 59:10.486
Oh, my God, all the time.
Whenever I fly.

59:11.564 --> 59:13.532
Oh. Penny a point?

59:34.687 --> 59:36.450
Hey, it's Tess.

59:36.623 --> 59:42.892
Don't get the wrong idea,
I just, uh, wanna talk. Um...

59:43.463 --> 59:49.402
I just thought,
since I've been kind of critical recently...

59:50.470 --> 59:54.930
...maybe I should tell you
how magnificent you were today...

59:55.108 --> 59:58.202
...you know, taking out their grid and...

59:59.545 --> 01:00:01.513
You couldn't hit Moe back.

01:00:01.914 --> 01:00:04.712
Uh, it just reminded me of how...

01:00:08.754 --> 01:00:10.517
Are you in here?

01:00:18.163 --> 01:00:19.289
Oh.

01:00:27.339 --> 01:00:28.806
Gin.

01:00:28.974 --> 01:00:30.669
What?

01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:36.548
Hundred and five.

01:00:36.715 --> 01:00:38.808
Twenty-eight thousand.

01:00:39.885 --> 01:00:43.719
- Dollars?
- Well, it's all going to charity, Daddy.

01:00:45.757 --> 01:00:48.089
Well, darling, I'm very pleased
you've inherited...

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:51.161
...not only your mother's beauty
and naïve charm...

01:00:53.065 --> 01:00:57.092
...but also her singular talent for
getting huge sums of money out of me...

01:00:57.269 --> 01:00:59.533
...with a modicum of effort.

01:01:04.443 --> 01:01:05.535
What's wrong?

01:01:08.046 --> 01:01:09.445
I don't want it.

01:01:09.615 --> 01:01:12.709
I'm sorry. It was a joke.

01:01:16.355 --> 01:01:18.448
I mean, be honest...

01:01:18.624 --> 01:01:23.118
...she didn't exactly marry me for love,
did she?

01:01:30.636 --> 01:01:32.763
My mother...

01:01:32.938 --> 01:01:38.103
...was a 24-year-old blackjack dealer
from Nebraska.

01:01:38.944 --> 01:01:43.176
You had to tip her $500
just to have a drink with you.

01:01:43.348 --> 01:01:46.875
You got married two weeks later
at the age of 175.

01:01:47.052 --> 01:01:48.747
- 51 to be precise.
- Now you're mad...

01:01:48.921 --> 01:01:52.152
...because she had the brains to get
some money before you dumped her?

01:01:52.324 --> 01:01:53.757
No, I'm mad about the amount.

01:01:53.926 --> 01:01:57.418
Oh, well, okay, you can have mine.
Because I'm cutting myself off.

01:01:57.596 --> 01:02:00.827
I don't want anything from you anymore.

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:05.036
Except for food. And clothes.

01:02:05.837 --> 01:02:09.068
And rent and, like, travel.

01:02:09.241 --> 01:02:11.402
And I'm totally serious.

01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:18.174
Yes, that's what is so frightening
about it.

01:02:20.919 --> 01:02:22.580
Gemma?

01:02:26.758 --> 01:02:28.487
For what it's worth...

01:02:28.961 --> 01:02:32.419
...I loved your mother, and I love you.

01:03:17.476 --> 01:03:20.274
You believe in ghosts, Curtis?

01:03:21.246 --> 01:03:25.410
You know what,
you are some kind of stupid.

01:03:25.584 --> 01:03:28.075
Now you sound like my wife.

01:03:28.253 --> 01:03:29.550
Bunny around?

01:03:29.721 --> 01:03:34.249
You know, I can't hear you,
you talking to my deaf ear.

01:03:34.426 --> 01:03:36.189
Oh, sorry.

01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:43.158
Curtis?

01:03:58.050 --> 01:04:00.848
Take me to see Bigg Bunny.

01:04:01.019 --> 01:04:04.546
Bigg Bunny ain't never wanna find out
you didn't drown the first time.

01:04:05.891 --> 01:04:07.222
Okay.

01:04:09.094 --> 01:04:10.584
Shit.

01:04:12.998 --> 01:04:15.398
When's the last time
you had this thing sharpened?

01:04:16.601 --> 01:04:18.000
1715.

01:04:22.407 --> 01:04:24.204
Okay, okay, okay, one second.

01:04:24.609 --> 01:04:29.308
Now look, 20 people saw me today,
everybody on Moe's boat.

01:04:29.481 --> 01:04:32.109
Now if you guys take me to Bigg Bunny...

01:04:32.284 --> 01:04:36.380
...it's gonna look a lot better than if
he finds out I'm alive from someone else.

01:04:37.522 --> 01:04:41.253
- It ain't his decision no more.
- Now, who in the hell are you?

01:04:50.435 --> 01:04:52.096
Ow.

01:04:52.537 --> 01:04:55.131
Ain't no fool like a gold fool.

01:04:55.307 --> 01:04:57.502
Ain't that right, Mr. Finnegan?

01:04:59.010 --> 01:05:00.705
Who's the new guy?

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:05.710
This here is Cyrus.
He's my new, uh, chief of staff.

01:05:06.785 --> 01:05:09.720
He's helping me to refocus, reform,
and renew.

01:05:10.422 --> 01:05:13.858
What do you need him for, huh?
We handling it.

01:05:18.096 --> 01:05:19.120
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

01:05:19.297 --> 01:05:22.061
God, jeez. What's the...?

01:05:22.734 --> 01:05:24.133
Why'd you do that?

01:05:24.302 --> 01:05:26.065
Just a little restructure.

01:05:26.638 --> 01:05:30.802
See, you let this boy get past
you not just once, but twice.

01:05:30.976 --> 01:05:32.238
So I hope you focused now.

01:05:32.410 --> 01:05:35.174
Oh, extremely focused. Very motivated.

01:05:35.347 --> 01:05:39.181
My morale probably 20 percent higher
than when I came in here.

01:05:39.351 --> 01:05:41.546
- Can I get a word in?
- What? What do you want?

01:05:42.621 --> 01:05:44.919
I wanna buy some time.

01:05:45.991 --> 01:05:47.982
You still breathing, ain't you?

01:05:49.461 --> 01:05:50.894
Yeah, thank you.

01:05:51.463 --> 01:05:52.521
Now, hear me out.

01:05:53.598 --> 01:05:57.193
All right, the way I see it, you bet
on Moe, you got a fifty-fifty chance...

01:05:57.369 --> 01:06:01.863
...but you bet on the both of us, and we
cover twice the ground in half the time...

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:07.478
...and I'm willing to give you 10 percent
of everything I find.

01:06:08.246 --> 01:06:11.181
Plus what I already owe you, of course.

01:06:12.017 --> 01:06:13.917
How much you say?

01:06:14.085 --> 01:06:16.679
Ten percent, across-the-board.

01:06:16.855 --> 01:06:18.220
Ten percent, huh?

01:06:18.557 --> 01:06:20.218
Wow.

01:06:21.026 --> 01:06:23.586
- Say it again.
- Come on, what...?

01:06:23.762 --> 01:06:25.161
You know, 12 percent's cool.

01:06:25.330 --> 01:06:27.924
You know, I couldn't even hear you.
What you say?

01:06:28.099 --> 01:06:31.125
- Fifteen percent, but I gotta find...
- I'm sorry, how much?

01:06:31.303 --> 01:06:34.272
- Eighteen, but I owe other people.
- That don't sound right.

01:06:34.439 --> 01:06:36.839
- Twenty percent, but that's it, final.
- Oh.

01:06:37.008 --> 01:06:38.839
Damn it. What? How much do you want?

01:06:39.711 --> 01:06:41.542
I'll tell you what.

01:06:45.584 --> 01:06:48.144
You find the treasure and I won't kill you.

01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:07.394
- How much do you owe him?
- Whoa.

01:07:08.473 --> 01:07:10.464
Jesus, Tess.

01:07:11.576 --> 01:07:12.702
How much do you owe him?

01:07:16.214 --> 01:07:19.183
Owe who? Owe who what?

01:07:19.584 --> 01:07:20.744
Bigg Bunny.

01:07:21.753 --> 01:07:23.220
I don't owe him any money.

01:07:23.388 --> 01:07:26.880
Finn, how much do you owe him?

01:07:27.459 --> 01:07:29.984
Just tell me so I'll know.

01:07:30.161 --> 01:07:33.562
Oh, God, Tess. I mean, that's so hard
to be specific about.

01:07:33.732 --> 01:07:36.200
- It's a really complex payment schedule...
- How much?

01:07:36.368 --> 01:07:41.032
Sixty-two thousand, five hundred and
eighty-one dollars and forty-three cents.

01:07:43.108 --> 01:07:44.370
But we're good now.

01:07:45.243 --> 01:07:47.575
Is there a reason
you didn't tell me this before?

01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:50.270
Yeah.

01:07:53.018 --> 01:07:54.781
You wouldn't have come.

01:07:56.521 --> 01:07:58.148
Yeah, I would.

01:07:59.658 --> 01:08:03.321
Just wouldn't have come with you.

01:08:13.271 --> 01:08:14.295
Are we finished?

01:08:18.376 --> 01:08:20.207
We sure are.

01:08:33.024 --> 01:08:34.218
- You good?
- Yeah.

01:08:34.392 --> 01:08:36.019
Okay.

01:08:36.995 --> 01:08:38.895
What happened to your face?

01:08:39.997 --> 01:08:42.432
Somebody hit me with a cricket bat.

01:08:42.634 --> 01:08:43.999
Ah.

01:08:46.171 --> 01:08:48.799
- This is a new type of regulator...
- Shove it up your ass.

01:08:48.973 --> 01:08:51.237
- All right, we're good to go.
- Ready, darling?

01:08:51.408 --> 01:08:53.274
Drop dead.

01:08:54.212 --> 01:08:56.703
This is just like the old days, huh?

01:09:28.078 --> 01:09:29.841
Hello, darling.

01:09:31.216 --> 01:09:32.740
Drink?

01:09:34.786 --> 01:09:36.117
I have one.

01:10:46.024 --> 01:10:47.855
You know what else
is really bugging me?

01:10:48.626 --> 01:10:49.991
No.

01:10:50.161 --> 01:10:54.393
Please, tell us. Because I may personally
drop dead from disappointment...

01:10:54.566 --> 01:10:58.764
...if I don't find out the 700-millionth thing
about life on planet Earth...

01:10:58.937 --> 01:11:00.598
...that is bugging you.

01:11:01.172 --> 01:11:02.537
Well, this is fun.

01:11:02.707 --> 01:11:04.140
No, listen.

01:11:04.776 --> 01:11:08.337
If I am the Dutch frigate
stuck on a reef in a dead calm...

01:11:08.513 --> 01:11:11.573
<i>...in the same cove
the Aurelia sank three years earlier...</i>

01:11:11.749 --> 01:11:15.947
...in less than 30 feet
of the clearest water in the world...

01:11:16.855 --> 01:11:20.723
Then how come I can't see her?

01:11:24.896 --> 01:11:26.921
Because she isn't there.

01:11:29.367 --> 01:11:30.493
Yeah, I don't know.

01:11:30.668 --> 01:11:34.627
No, no, no. Sebastian specifically said
that's where she sank.

01:11:34.806 --> 01:11:36.637
- And he said it.
- Yeah.

01:11:36.808 --> 01:11:41.074
My dear children, your entire theory
is predicated on the proposition...

01:11:41.246 --> 01:11:46.013
...that Sebastian lied about everything he
could to prevent the ship being found.

01:11:46.184 --> 01:11:50.314
So why on Earth would
he tell the truth about where she sank?

01:11:51.322 --> 01:11:54.519
<i>I mean, it seems to me that
the Aurelia can't be in the cove...</i>

01:11:54.692 --> 01:11:58.128
...for the simple reason that
that's where Sebastian said she was.

01:12:13.611 --> 01:12:14.737
Sorry to disturb.

01:12:14.913 --> 01:12:17.609
We've had to move to the lee side
on account of the storm.

01:12:17.782 --> 01:12:19.807
She won't fit in the marina?

01:12:19.984 --> 01:12:23.613
Afraid not. A taxi will take you
to the beach on the north end.

01:12:23.788 --> 01:12:26.780
- Call, we'll pick you up on the launch.
- Better safe than sorry.

01:12:26.958 --> 01:12:28.391
Sir.

01:12:29.093 --> 01:12:31.994
I've grown rather fond of not sinking.

01:12:32.196 --> 01:12:34.221
Ugh. Don't even say that.

01:12:34.399 --> 01:12:37.334
Oh, it would be a shame
to lose the art collection.

01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:38.693
Or Gemma's shoes.

01:12:39.604 --> 01:12:43.233
Especially because we're so close
to shore, you know?

01:12:47.078 --> 01:12:48.170
Oh, my God.

01:12:50.081 --> 01:12:51.548
What?

01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:53.178
Oh, my God, of course.

01:12:53.351 --> 01:12:55.012
Of course what?

01:12:57.221 --> 01:12:59.746
You are a genius.

01:13:01.593 --> 01:13:02.753
Stefan.

01:13:03.194 --> 01:13:05.287
- Stefan.
- Yes.

01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:08.224
Why did you pick the north beach?

01:13:08.733 --> 01:13:11.861
I didn't. It's the only beach on the
island not blocked by the reef.

01:13:12.637 --> 01:13:15.765
Yes. Yes. He ran her aground.

01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:17.601
What are you so happy about?

01:13:17.775 --> 01:13:20.300
- He ran her aground.
- What?

01:13:20.478 --> 01:13:26.178
To save the Dowry. Sebastian ran
the whole goddamn thing aground.

01:13:27.485 --> 01:13:30.943
Bet you $ 1000 I find something
between here and that beach.

01:13:31.122 --> 01:13:32.851
You don't have $ 1000.

01:13:33.591 --> 01:13:34.683
Fine, make it 10.

01:13:35.259 --> 01:13:36.726
You don't have $ 10.

01:13:37.495 --> 01:13:39.554
Fine, make it a million.

01:13:45.803 --> 01:13:47.361
What are you doing?

01:13:47.538 --> 01:13:50.371
You think I'm letting you go out
there alone, you're crazy.

01:13:50.708 --> 01:13:52.198
What, you don't trust me?

01:13:52.377 --> 01:13:54.937
Why on Earth would I trust you?

01:13:56.447 --> 01:13:57.971
Huh.

01:15:15.293 --> 01:15:17.158
- I found a cannon.
- I found a cannon.

01:15:17.328 --> 01:15:18.989
- You did what?
- You mean there's two?

01:15:19.163 --> 01:15:20.653
- There's two cannons.
- Aah!

01:15:20.832 --> 01:15:23.699
- And I owe you a million dollars. Aah!
- Yes, you do. Oh!

01:15:23.868 --> 01:15:25.301
Whoo!

01:15:25.737 --> 01:15:27.568
<i>We got the Aurelia, baby!</i>

01:15:27.739 --> 01:15:32.233
Listen to me, if anybody finds out about
this outside of our crew, we are screwed.

01:15:32.410 --> 01:15:35.004
Wow. Can't you just enjoy this
for a second?

01:15:36.247 --> 01:15:38.272
Oh, I'm enjoying it.

01:15:42.153 --> 01:15:45.316
Oh, God. Thank God.

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:51.394
Whoo-hoo!

01:16:18.623 --> 01:16:19.920
Well, there's not much here.

01:16:20.091 --> 01:16:24.027
Now, they probably burned the ship
and took everything inland.

01:16:24.195 --> 01:16:27.653
Look, a pistol.
- Cool.

01:16:27.832 --> 01:16:31.165
All right, well, what do we know
about Topsail Cay?

01:16:31.569 --> 01:16:33.901
We got the town, the church...

01:16:34.071 --> 01:16:35.197
There's Preacher's Cave.

01:16:35.373 --> 01:16:38.399
We were up there once.
It said something about first settlers...

01:16:38.576 --> 01:16:39.600
...religious freedom...

01:16:39.777 --> 01:16:42.302
God, I think that is just so important.

01:16:44.015 --> 01:16:45.312
Yeah, but that was like...

01:16:46.217 --> 01:16:49.709
- Oh.
- Like 1780-something.

01:16:50.855 --> 01:16:54.120
I mean, Sebastian beat them here
by almost 70 years.

01:16:54.292 --> 01:16:56.487
If there are any records,
they're in the church.

01:16:56.661 --> 01:16:59.892
- Letters, journals, sermons.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:17:01.232 --> 01:17:03.359
That's smart, Tess.

01:17:04.135 --> 01:17:06.569
It's the oldest building on the island.

01:17:08.472 --> 01:17:09.871
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

01:17:17.982 --> 01:17:19.677
When Moe finds out we're gone...

01:17:19.851 --> 01:17:22.319
...he's gonna come barreling up
your ass like a freight train.

01:17:22.486 --> 01:17:24.716
Oh, my, that ought to be interesting.

01:17:24.889 --> 01:17:27.756
Well, I'm just saying
we don't have much time.

01:17:28.392 --> 01:17:29.450
Oh, my God.

01:17:30.228 --> 01:17:31.252
Stop the boat!

01:17:31.429 --> 01:17:35.456
I just figured it out. It's been
right in front of us this whole time.

01:17:35.633 --> 01:17:36.759
What?

01:17:37.368 --> 01:17:39.598
<i>Precious Gem.</i>

01:17:40.438 --> 01:17:41.462
Yes.

01:17:41.939 --> 01:17:47.673
Well, do you realize how incredibly similar
the word "gem" is to "Gemma"?

01:17:48.913 --> 01:17:51.279
Uh... I thought I did.

01:17:51.449 --> 01:17:52.848
My God.

01:17:53.017 --> 01:17:56.714
Daddy, you named the boat after me
and didn't even know it.

01:17:58.289 --> 01:17:59.415
I didn't?

01:18:00.524 --> 01:18:01.650
Don't you see?

01:18:04.795 --> 01:18:09.232
You were running away to sea,
only you wanted to bring me along.

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:12.528
So you unconsciously
named the boat after me.

01:18:14.939 --> 01:18:17.908
That is so beautiful.

01:18:24.148 --> 01:18:26.912
Of course I named it for you, Gemma.

01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:33.254
But it wasn't unconscious.
I gave it a lot of thought.

01:18:33.424 --> 01:18:37.258
No. You did it unconsciously.

01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:42.424
And then I did it unconsciously.

01:19:07.458 --> 01:19:09.050
Good afternoon.

01:19:09.226 --> 01:19:11.285
Afternoon. May I help you?

01:19:11.462 --> 01:19:14.090
- I hope so. I'm Finnegan.
- Nice to meet you.

01:19:14.265 --> 01:19:15.459
- Tess.
- Tess.

01:19:29.447 --> 01:19:30.971
Don't even think about it.

01:19:31.749 --> 01:19:34.809
- What?
- Don't "what" me. You know what.

01:19:35.987 --> 01:19:39.184
It's weird, right?

01:19:40.658 --> 01:19:43.821
- What?
- This.

01:19:44.462 --> 01:19:46.089
Us, together.

01:19:46.497 --> 01:19:50.331
It's complex, but not in a good way.

01:19:55.239 --> 01:19:59.300
Well, can I just say
I really wish we were still married?

01:20:04.448 --> 01:20:05.972
No.

01:20:14.859 --> 01:20:16.292
Oh, my God, listen to this.

01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:19.327
Listen. "That we are by no means...

01:20:19.497 --> 01:20:21.590
...the first Europeans to visit here...

01:20:21.766 --> 01:20:25.293
...is finally proven
by the discovery of a Spanish gravestone...

01:20:25.469 --> 01:20:27.027
...that of a woman.

01:20:27.204 --> 01:20:29.399
I cannot but wonder who she was...

01:20:29.573 --> 01:20:32.838
...and how she came to die here,
for the headstone reads simply...

01:20:33.010 --> 01:20:35.240
...'Aurelia, 1715."'

01:20:35.413 --> 01:20:36.812
Holy shit.

01:20:36.981 --> 01:20:40.473
"Forsake her I could not.

01:20:40.651 --> 01:20:44.109
And so it was here,
on this beautiful hilltop...

01:20:44.288 --> 01:20:47.746
...that I resolved to bury our own dead...

01:20:47.925 --> 01:20:51.918
...and begin work building a church."

01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:55.294
He marked it with a headstone.

01:20:55.466 --> 01:20:57.957
And this guy built a church around it.

01:20:58.135 --> 01:21:00.569
- It's in the cemetery.
- It's in the cemetery.

01:21:06.577 --> 01:21:07.839
- Finn.
- Mm-hm.

01:21:09.513 --> 01:21:11.003
Oh...

01:21:12.216 --> 01:21:14.184
- No, come on.
- Here we go.

01:21:14.351 --> 01:21:15.875
Oh, shit, I got you.

01:21:18.456 --> 01:21:20.117
Mm-hm.

01:21:33.370 --> 01:21:35.099
Anything?

01:21:36.373 --> 01:21:38.307
It's not here.

01:21:38.509 --> 01:21:41.034
I refuse to believe that.

01:21:41.545 --> 01:21:46.642
Well, just because you refuse to
believe something doesn't make it true.

01:21:46.817 --> 01:21:48.512
Or false.

01:21:49.386 --> 01:21:51.911
Or whatever the hell I'm saying.

01:21:52.089 --> 01:21:53.113
Something wrong, Tess?

01:21:53.290 --> 01:21:56.157
Something wrong?
Why would anything be wrong?

01:21:56.327 --> 01:21:58.955
We just had sex in a church
and we're not even married...

01:21:59.130 --> 01:22:01.064
...and now we're gonna dig up a grave.

01:22:01.232 --> 01:22:02.927
What is that, like a triple sin?

01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:05.500
I can't believe we haven't been
struck by lightning. Oh!

01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:08.335
- Ow.
- Oh, shit, you okay?

01:22:08.506 --> 01:22:11.703
Stupid rock.
That's the second time I've done that.

01:22:11.876 --> 01:22:13.207
Okay, we can't have that.

01:22:13.377 --> 01:22:15.743
Come here, you rock. Stupid rock.

01:22:21.919 --> 01:22:23.284
Wait, stop.

01:22:23.454 --> 01:22:25.649
Oh... Honey, it's heavy.

01:22:27.925 --> 01:22:30.189
So is this.

01:22:56.654 --> 01:22:58.281
Finn? Finn?

01:23:00.124 --> 01:23:01.148
Finn.

01:23:01.325 --> 01:23:02.917
- What?
- What if it's a body?

01:23:06.497 --> 01:23:09.830
Well, then he was a midget
with very cheap relatives.

01:23:12.336 --> 01:23:15.794
- What if it's a head?
- Do you mind?

01:23:59.416 --> 01:24:01.384
Oh, my God.

01:24:04.989 --> 01:24:06.354
It's his.

01:24:06.991 --> 01:24:09.221
"To my everlasting relief...

01:24:09.393 --> 01:24:13.022
...and after a year's toil
in this lonely place...

01:24:13.197 --> 01:24:17.395
...have I finally stumbled upon
a suitable place...

01:24:17.568 --> 01:24:19.559
...for my cargo...

01:24:19.737 --> 01:24:23.901
...fortified by nature
against the encroachments...

01:24:24.074 --> 01:24:25.507
...accidental or deliberate...

01:24:25.676 --> 01:24:30.875
...even of those who would force
our tongues to betray its trust.

01:24:31.849 --> 01:24:37.378
The low December tide showed us
the only way in and the only way out.

01:24:37.554 --> 01:24:39.317
But from January to November...

01:24:39.490 --> 01:24:43.688
...the beached whale's spout
is both ingress or egress.

01:24:43.861 --> 01:24:47.922
Thus is the vault rendered,
made virtually impenetrable."

01:24:48.098 --> 01:24:52.262
The beached whale's spout?
Are you sure?

01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:58.635
Yeah.

01:25:02.112 --> 01:25:04.603
It's a blowhole.

01:25:06.650 --> 01:25:08.049
It's the one at Clifton Point.

01:25:08.218 --> 01:25:12.314
- The low December tide drops so low...
- The winter solstice.

01:25:12.489 --> 01:25:15.617
The lowest tide of the year
exposes the mouth of the blowhole...

01:25:15.793 --> 01:25:19.251
...which is normally
under 15 to 20 feet of water.

01:25:19.730 --> 01:25:21.925
Two days out of the year it's a cave.

01:25:22.433 --> 01:25:25.561
They float the chests in, the tide returns...

01:25:25.736 --> 01:25:28.034
...then the place becomes a deathtrap.

01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:32.768
Did we just find our treasure?

01:25:34.244 --> 01:25:35.973
Sound like it.

01:25:37.815 --> 01:25:39.510
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Finnegan.

01:25:40.117 --> 01:25:41.675
Hey, Bunny.

01:25:41.852 --> 01:25:43.752
What the hell are you doing here?

01:25:44.421 --> 01:25:46.048
- Give me the book.
- Come on, Bunny.

01:25:46.223 --> 01:25:51.525
I mean, are you sure you don't wanna,
you know, give it to the new guy?

01:25:58.135 --> 01:26:00.194
What you think you're gonna
do with that, huh?

01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:05.534
Hey, you better put the damn shovel...

01:26:09.146 --> 01:26:12.047
Hey, hey, hey, look, you know,
I don't want no trouble.

01:26:12.216 --> 01:26:13.308
Get me out the hole!

01:26:16.954 --> 01:26:19.013
Get him, baby, get him.

01:26:27.531 --> 01:26:28.964
Finn!

01:26:30.934 --> 01:26:33.198
Where you...? What you...? Grab him.

01:26:37.374 --> 01:26:38.739
Come on.

01:26:41.445 --> 01:26:42.935
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:26:43.113 --> 01:26:44.171
Come on, go, go, go.

01:26:45.349 --> 01:26:47.340
Hey. Hey...

01:26:51.688 --> 01:26:53.178
Get after them, damn it.

01:26:55.259 --> 01:26:56.283
Hang on.

01:26:56.460 --> 01:26:59.224
Cyrus, my bike. Hey, you.

01:27:00.931 --> 01:27:01.955
Are you shot?

01:27:03.267 --> 01:27:05.394
- What?
- Shot? You?

01:27:05.569 --> 01:27:09.096
- No. Are you shot?
- No, not yet.

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:12.432
We got the book, Cyrus.

01:27:12.609 --> 01:27:14.008
Finn!

01:27:14.178 --> 01:27:15.202
I got you, Tess!

01:27:15.712 --> 01:27:19.239
- Duck!
- What? Ugh!

01:27:20.317 --> 01:27:22.148
- Finn!
- Uh-oh.

01:27:26.523 --> 01:27:28.889
Finn. No.

01:27:31.829 --> 01:27:35.595
No. Finn. Oh, my...

01:27:42.072 --> 01:27:43.903
Finn.

01:27:45.676 --> 01:27:47.303
Let's go.

01:27:57.821 --> 01:28:01.120
You sure he's dead? I've been
disappointed a lot of times before.

01:28:01.291 --> 01:28:04.488
I should've aimed at your head,
you little son of a bitch.

01:28:04.862 --> 01:28:06.329
I'm gonna tell you what.

01:28:06.497 --> 01:28:09.830
I'm gonna have my boys submit your theory
to a little academic review...

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.264
...while I go sit my balls on some ice.

01:28:36.493 --> 01:28:39.223
After this wave,
you've got about 50 seconds.

01:28:44.268 --> 01:28:45.758
Would you just get in the hole?

01:28:46.203 --> 01:28:48.433
Whoa! Whoo!

01:28:55.712 --> 01:28:57.179
I can't.

01:28:57.381 --> 01:28:58.541
Uh...

01:28:58.715 --> 01:29:00.273
Excuse me, Curtis.

01:29:00.717 --> 01:29:02.651
Get in the hole.

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:07.017
Damn, Cyrus.
Why you always in my business, huh?

01:29:07.190 --> 01:29:09.556
I'm handling this shit.

01:29:16.567 --> 01:29:18.398
You know what? You run it.

01:29:20.637 --> 01:29:22.127
You run it.

01:29:42.025 --> 01:29:43.515
It's not here.

01:29:43.694 --> 01:29:45.719
Check underwater.

01:29:47.497 --> 01:29:49.158
There's nothing but rock.

01:29:49.333 --> 01:29:50.925
I'm supposed to believe you, am I?

01:29:51.101 --> 01:29:55.800
You want a second opinion, come on down.
Get me out of here.

01:29:55.973 --> 01:29:57.201
Please.

01:29:57.407 --> 01:29:58.874
Pull her up, man.

01:30:02.613 --> 01:30:03.637
Hey.

01:30:03.814 --> 01:30:05.782
Say hi to your husband.

01:30:05.949 --> 01:30:07.177
What? No.

01:30:07.351 --> 01:30:08.875
What the hell are you doing, man?

01:30:09.052 --> 01:30:10.542
Oh, God.

01:30:17.561 --> 01:30:19.392
Throw me the rope.

01:31:47.384 --> 01:31:48.476
Whoo!

01:31:48.652 --> 01:31:51.553
Now that's what I'm talking about.

01:32:00.063 --> 01:32:01.189
<i>Talk to me.</i>

01:32:01.364 --> 01:32:03.229
It's here. Bring the tanks.

01:32:03.734 --> 01:32:06.635
We're gonna have to go in
through the ocean.

01:32:06.803 --> 01:32:07.895
<i>And the girl?</i>

01:32:08.105 --> 01:32:09.231
Uh...

01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:12.039
She won't need one.

01:32:32.395 --> 01:32:33.419
This better be good.

01:32:33.597 --> 01:32:36.532
Moe, it's Finn. It's bad, it's real bad.

01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:38.531
<i>- They got Tess.
- What?</i>

01:32:38.702 --> 01:32:41.068
The treasure's in the blowhole
at Clifton Point.

01:32:41.238 --> 01:32:42.262
They took her hostage.

01:33:03.627 --> 01:33:07.586
That is one big-ass,
sensible-sized emerald.

01:33:10.734 --> 01:33:13.202
Sure, go have fun.
Go get yourselves killed.

01:33:13.370 --> 01:33:15.565
Go pump some lead in your fellow man.
Go ahead.

01:33:15.739 --> 01:33:16.763
What a sissy.

01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:18.931
He is more man
than you'll ever be, honey.

01:33:19.109 --> 01:33:20.576
Hey. You ladies wanna move out?

01:33:21.144 --> 01:33:23.772
They could have killed
a whole graduation class by now.

01:33:23.947 --> 01:33:25.505
Daddy.

01:33:26.416 --> 01:33:29.510
- I'm scared.
- She's going to be all right.

01:33:29.686 --> 01:33:32.553
- I promise.
- I'm worried about you.

01:33:33.890 --> 01:33:36.085
Oh, bless you for that.

01:33:37.227 --> 01:33:38.558
I'll see you at breakfast.

01:34:22.239 --> 01:34:25.606
Hey! Hey!

01:34:27.510 --> 01:34:29.000
Goddamn.

01:34:29.179 --> 01:34:31.374
How many times am I gonna
have to kill this boy?

01:34:39.022 --> 01:34:40.649
Shit.

01:34:45.228 --> 01:34:46.889
Oh, shit.

01:34:50.333 --> 01:34:52.198
Somebody help.

01:34:54.170 --> 01:34:55.330
Tess!

01:34:56.072 --> 01:34:57.699
Finn?

01:34:58.875 --> 01:35:00.172
Finn!

01:35:11.254 --> 01:35:12.846
Shit.

01:35:47.023 --> 01:35:49.992
Whoo. There's a whole lot more
where this came from.

01:36:04.841 --> 01:36:07.639
- Where's Cyrus?
- He said he'd be right up.

01:36:12.983 --> 01:36:14.644
Mm.

01:36:17.954 --> 01:36:18.978
Ugh.

01:36:23.393 --> 01:36:24.485
Find out who that was.

01:36:24.694 --> 01:36:26.719
- Huh?
- You heard me.

01:37:36.666 --> 01:37:38.065
Oh, my God.

01:37:38.935 --> 01:37:39.993
Shit.

01:37:41.171 --> 01:37:42.331
Cover me.

01:37:42.505 --> 01:37:43.733
Where you going?

01:37:43.907 --> 01:37:46.102
Where's he going? Wait.
Where are you going?

01:37:46.276 --> 01:37:47.402
Shit, man.

01:37:56.119 --> 01:37:57.347
Aah!

01:37:58.521 --> 01:38:00.785
You son of a bitch.

01:38:01.157 --> 01:38:02.454
Uh-oh.

01:38:21.377 --> 01:38:24.676
Here, cock it. Cock it.

01:38:25.648 --> 01:38:28.173
I can't make it cock.

01:38:34.591 --> 01:38:36.183
No, no, no.

01:38:46.769 --> 01:38:48.498
Give that to me.

01:38:52.142 --> 01:38:55.077
- You okay, Moe?
- Yeah, great.

01:38:55.245 --> 01:38:58.442
- Get in the plane. Get...
- No. Aah!

01:39:00.283 --> 01:39:03.150
- No.
- Get your hands off her.

01:39:09.859 --> 01:39:10.985
Get in the plane.

01:39:26.176 --> 01:39:27.473
Sit back.

01:39:29.512 --> 01:39:32.572
Get your hands... Sit back now.
Sit back now.

01:39:34.017 --> 01:39:35.609
Shit.

01:40:00.176 --> 01:40:02.701
Gemma. No.

01:40:06.716 --> 01:40:09.446
- Get me on that plane.
- Hang on.

01:40:09.619 --> 01:40:13.020
Go. Go. Go.

01:40:13.723 --> 01:40:15.588
You happy now, you big butch bastard?

01:40:15.758 --> 01:40:18.852
Just go help Moe. Go help him.

01:40:20.530 --> 01:40:23.260
I want you to pull me right up
next to the port side.

01:40:23.433 --> 01:40:24.730
What's a port side?

01:40:24.934 --> 01:40:26.799
Uh... The left side.

01:40:26.970 --> 01:40:28.403
- Oh, okay.
- Right next to her.

01:40:42.919 --> 01:40:44.750
- Go, go, go, stay with it.
- Okay.

01:40:48.858 --> 01:40:52.385
- My God, what are you doing?
- Pull right up next to the pontoon.

01:41:19.589 --> 01:41:20.886
Whoa!

01:41:24.861 --> 01:41:27.694
Now that's a man who loves his wife.

01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:35.669
That's it.

01:41:36.806 --> 01:41:38.137
That's it.

01:41:58.094 --> 01:41:59.118
Oh!

01:42:05.968 --> 01:42:08.334
- Tess!
- Finn!

01:42:16.612 --> 01:42:17.840
Tess!

01:42:18.581 --> 01:42:19.673
Oh!

01:42:19.849 --> 01:42:22.943
Damn, baby,
since when do you know how to fly?

01:42:23.119 --> 01:42:25.178
Don't. Can't.

01:42:26.956 --> 01:42:31.916
Well, you're doing a great job.
I mean, we're still in the air, right?

01:42:32.128 --> 01:42:33.425
Technically.

01:42:34.464 --> 01:42:35.488
Oh, shit.

01:42:36.699 --> 01:42:39.031
I think he hit the engine.

01:42:39.769 --> 01:42:42.431
Okay. Um...

01:42:42.672 --> 01:42:47.473
Wings, flaps, air speed, altitude...

01:42:47.744 --> 01:42:51.612
...pedals for the rudder. Check. Okay.

01:42:51.781 --> 01:42:53.942
- How do you know what to do?
- You know...

01:42:54.117 --> 01:42:56.017
...PlayStation. Ha-ha!

01:42:58.054 --> 01:43:00.022
Oh, God.

01:43:00.289 --> 01:43:01.722
- Oh, God.
- Hang on, hang on.

01:43:01.891 --> 01:43:03.518
Here we go. Aah!

01:43:06.896 --> 01:43:09.262
Whoo! Finn!

01:43:09.799 --> 01:43:12.290
- Wow. Whoa.
- Hey, you're doing it.

01:43:12.468 --> 01:43:16.802
Way to go. That's great, oh, wow.
We're flying.

01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:18.898
Yep.

01:43:19.442 --> 01:43:20.568
How do we land?

01:43:22.245 --> 01:43:23.542
Yep.

01:43:25.515 --> 01:43:26.982
How'd you do it in the game?

01:43:32.321 --> 01:43:37.554
I'm rich! I'm rich! I'm rich!

01:43:48.471 --> 01:43:51.599
Now, honey, this next part...

01:43:51.774 --> 01:43:55.141
...l'm not exactly sure how to pull off.

01:43:55.578 --> 01:43:59.378
I do know that we've got to completely
stall out just before we hit the water.

01:43:59.549 --> 01:44:01.210
- Stall?
- Stop flying.

01:44:01.384 --> 01:44:04.615
- Stop flying?
- Yeah, and land.

01:44:05.455 --> 01:44:08.288
On the nice soft... water.

01:44:09.459 --> 01:44:11.893
- Are we gonna die?
- No.

01:44:12.295 --> 01:44:13.990
No, we're not.

01:44:18.468 --> 01:44:20.902
Oh, shit, where's Finn?

01:44:21.471 --> 01:44:23.439
Probably he's flying the plane.

01:44:23.606 --> 01:44:25.540
You mean there's hope?

01:44:25.708 --> 01:44:28.108
Not necessarily.

01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:33.312
- Hey, let me just say this.
- No.

01:44:35.017 --> 01:44:36.951
- Well, why not?
- Because.

01:44:37.119 --> 01:44:39.280
Tell me after we crash.

01:44:41.524 --> 01:44:43.890
That'll give me something
to look forward to.

01:44:57.139 --> 01:44:58.800
Okay.

01:45:14.323 --> 01:45:15.688
One hundred.

01:45:19.829 --> 01:45:22.161
We got it, baby. Eighty.

01:45:23.566 --> 01:45:25.090
Sixty.

01:45:28.004 --> 01:45:29.028
Forty.

01:45:32.008 --> 01:45:33.703
Pull her up, boy.

01:45:34.410 --> 01:45:37.208
Baby, baby...

01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:38.870
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:45:39.048 --> 01:45:40.106
Pull her up.

01:45:54.297 --> 01:45:55.321
Oh, shit.

01:46:13.716 --> 01:46:15.479
Finn?

01:46:18.454 --> 01:46:19.887
I'm sorry.

01:46:20.056 --> 01:46:23.719
I love you.
I've learned a lot from my mistakes.

01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:25.052
Marry me.

01:46:25.261 --> 01:46:26.956
No...

01:46:27.463 --> 01:46:29.260
...you haven't.

01:46:29.765 --> 01:46:31.528
And, yes...

01:46:31.701 --> 01:46:33.362
...I will.

01:46:39.742 --> 01:46:40.902
Baby.

01:46:41.077 --> 01:46:43.007
What?

01:52:21.216 --> 01:52:23.207
