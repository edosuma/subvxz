You can't get me.

01:17.367 --> 01:19.000
You can't get me, Elmo!

01:19.000 --> 01:21.233
Tag, you're it, Abby.
Ha ha ha!

01:21.233 --> 01:23.433
Oh. Hey, Elmo,
look who's here.

01:23.433 --> 01:25.767
Yeah, hi.
Welcome to Sesame Street.

01:25.767 --> 01:27.133
- And Happy New Year.

01:27.133 --> 01:28.667
- Oh, hi, Nina.
- Hi.

01:28.667 --> 01:29.967
Um, Elmo doesn't think

01:29.967 --> 01:31.900
that it's the new year
right now.

01:31.900 --> 01:33.800
Well, not on our calendar,
it's not.

01:33.800 --> 01:36.133
Today's the Chinese New Year.

01:36.133 --> 01:38.533
But we're not in China.

01:38.533 --> 01:40.867
That's true, but you don't
need to be Chinese

01:40.867 --> 01:43.400
or live in China
to celebrate Chinese New Year.

01:43.400 --> 01:45.433
It's also called
the Spring Festival.

01:45.433 --> 01:47.700
Oh, because people
are so happy,

01:47.700 --> 01:49.834
they spring up and down
like this?

01:49.834 --> 01:51.433
Spring, spring,
spring, spring.

01:51.433 --> 01:53.934
I think they're celebrating that
springtime is coming.

01:53.934 --> 01:55.934
- Oh.
- Oh, well,
that makes sense, too.

01:55.934 --> 01:57.700
Yeah.

01:57.700 --> 02:00.166
I've been learning all
about Chinese New Year
in this great book.

02:00.166 --> 02:01.266
You want to check it out?

02:01.266 --> 02:02.500
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I'd love to.

02:02.500 --> 02:04.867
Let's check it out.
Oh, boy.

02:04.867 --> 02:06.400
- Oh, yeah.

02:06.400 --> 02:10.033
So, to get ready,
many families clean their homes

02:10.033 --> 02:12.467
and hang decorations,
like these lanterns.

02:12.467 --> 02:17.767
Wow! Hey, those lanterns
are red like Elmo.

02:17.767 --> 02:20.166
Oh, oh, and Nina has
some red lanterns

02:20.166 --> 02:21.934
hanging up here
at the bike shop.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.800
In Chinese culture,
the color red

02:23.800 --> 02:25.934
represents luck
and good fortune.

02:25.934 --> 02:29.100
Really? Elmo likes
the Chinese New Year already.

02:29.100 --> 02:30.867
Yeah, me, too.

02:30.867 --> 02:33.033
So, um, what happens during
this celebration?

02:33.033 --> 02:34.400
Yeah.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.166
Nina:
Well, Chinese families
and friends

02:36.166 --> 02:37.867
gather and eat together.

02:37.867 --> 02:39.133
And people all over
the world

02:39.133 --> 02:40.467
celebrate in lots
of different ways.

02:40.467 --> 02:43.033
- Wow.
- Some of them doing...

02:43.033 --> 02:45.300
- the Dragon Dance!
- Ohh!

02:45.300 --> 02:47.400
Abby:
A dancing dragon?

02:47.400 --> 02:49.400
Oh, does the dragon
tap

02:49.400 --> 02:52.734
Tap, tap, rawr!
Tap, tap, rawr!

02:52.734 --> 02:54.934
Ha ha!
Um, Nina,

02:54.934 --> 02:58.233
Elmo thinks that dragon
looks a little scary.

02:58.233 --> 03:00.166
Does it breathe fire?

03:00.166 --> 03:02.000
Well, no, it's not
a real dragon.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.700
You see the dancers
underneath?

03:03.700 --> 03:05.867
Oh. Elmo knew that.
Ha ha ha.

03:05.867 --> 03:08.300
Ha ha. Yeah.
And see these scales?

03:08.300 --> 03:09.767
Uh-huh.

03:09.767 --> 03:11.600
They're actually
little pieces of paper.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.433
People write
their wishes on them

03:13.433 --> 03:15.200
and put them
on the dragon.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.467
- Oh!
- I love making wishes.

03:17.467 --> 03:18.934
Yeah, Elmo, too.

03:18.934 --> 03:21.667
Oh, Elmo has a wish
right now.

03:21.667 --> 03:24.700
Elmo wishes we could
do the dragon dance

03:24.700 --> 03:27.166
- for the Chinese New Year.
- Yeah.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.500
I wish we could, too,

03:28.500 --> 03:30.633
but where would I buy
a dragon costume right now?

03:30.633 --> 03:32.467
Well, we don't need
a dragon costume

03:32.467 --> 03:35.667
from a store
to do the dragon dance.

03:35.667 --> 03:38.767
- We can make our own dragon.
- Yeah, that's right.

03:38.767 --> 03:42.200
Oh, Abby can just
poof a dragon with
her magic wand.

03:42.200 --> 03:43.600
Go for it, Abby.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.900
Uh, well, actually,
I can't.

03:45.900 --> 03:48.133
I left my magic wand
in my cubby at school.

03:48.133 --> 03:49.800
- Oh.
- But, uh, well,

03:49.800 --> 03:52.467
we don't need magic
to make a dragon costume.

03:52.467 --> 03:53.934
Abby's right.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.600
We have everything
we need to make a dragon

03:55.600 --> 03:57.200
for Chinese New Year.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.033

I know,
it's exciting.

05:19.200 --> 05:22.233
Now let's take a look
at the picture

05:22.233 --> 05:23.800
and see what we're making.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.100
- Oh, good idea.
What picture?

05:25.100 --> 05:26.700
Oh, wait till you see,
Grover.

05:26.700 --> 05:28.834
- Here we go.

05:28.834 --> 05:33.867
Grover:
Oh, that is what everybody
is talking about.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.867
The musical number makes
a lot more sense now.

05:35.867 --> 05:38.633
Ha ha ha!
Oh, Elmo likes
the bright fabric

05:38.633 --> 05:40.333
on the dragon's back.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.266
You know, I have a colorful
bedsheet like that.

05:42.266 --> 05:43.467
I will go get it.

05:43.467 --> 05:45.266
- Oh, boy.
- Thanks, Grover.

05:45.266 --> 05:48.000
And you know what, I have
some leftover decorations

05:48.000 --> 05:50.200
from my birthday party
that will look great

05:50.200 --> 05:51.867
on that dragon.
I'll get them.

05:51.867 --> 05:55.266
Oh, oh! And Elmo has--
Elmo has...

05:55.266 --> 05:57.667
Oh, ho ho.
An idea.

05:57.667 --> 05:58.900
Oh, come on, Nina.
Let's go.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.967
Oh, okay.

06:00.967 --> 06:03.233
Come on, Nina.
Ooh, ooh.

06:03.233 --> 06:06.967
Elmo's idea is to ask
Oscar for ideas.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.834
Oh, that's great, Elmo.

06:08.834 --> 06:11.400
Oscar probably has a bunch
of crafty recycled stuff

06:11.400 --> 06:12.900
- we can reuse.
- Right.

06:12.900 --> 06:15.266
Ha ha ha!

06:15.266 --> 06:16.767
Oscar!

06:16.767 --> 06:18.433
Yeah?
What do you want?

06:18.433 --> 06:20.567
- Hi, Oscar.
- Eh.

06:20.567 --> 06:24.700
Elmo and Nina are
making a dragon costume.

06:24.700 --> 06:26.700
- Yeah, to celebrate
Chinese New Year.

06:26.700 --> 06:28.700
Yeah, we were hoping
that you might have some stuff

06:28.700 --> 06:31.066
we could reuse
to make the dragon.

06:31.066 --> 06:33.066
Hmm.
Let me see.

06:33.066 --> 06:35.066
- Stay right there.
- Okay.

06:35.066 --> 06:36.967
That's hideous.
They can have that.

06:36.967 --> 06:39.834
Yeah, yeah. I got tons
of stuff that you can take

06:39.834 --> 06:41.200
that I don't want,

06:41.200 --> 06:44.266
like these party hats
here and--

06:44.266 --> 06:45.567
Well, what's wrong
with them?

06:45.567 --> 06:47.800
Nothing.
They're completely clean.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.467
Not a dent on them.

06:49.467 --> 06:52.667
Yuck! The same with
the rest of this stuff.

06:52.667 --> 06:54.000
Oh, well,
we'll take it.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.066
- Yeah.

06:55.066 --> 06:56.333
Well, hurry,
will you?

06:56.333 --> 06:58.100
I don't like touching
stuff that's clean.

06:58.100 --> 06:59.400
- Okay.
- Take it. Take it.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.934
Oh, thank you,
Oscar.

07:01.934 --> 07:03.734
Don't thank me.

07:03.734 --> 07:05.767
Just make sure to keep
your celebratin'

07:05.767 --> 07:07.500
away from my can.

07:07.500 --> 07:08.934
- Oh, okay.
- Now scram.

07:08.934 --> 07:10.433
Okay, okay, okay.

07:11.767 --> 07:13.467
- Ha ha ha!

07:13.467 --> 07:16.000
Nina looks just like
a dragon.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.734
Ha ha ha. Ohh!

07:17.734 --> 07:19.066
Hi, Abby.

07:19.066 --> 07:21.200
Welcome to
Dragon Headquarters.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.600
Ha ha ha!

07:22.600 --> 07:24.667
Hi. Listen. Hold on
to the craft supplies.

07:24.667 --> 07:27.066
It's windy here. Ha ha.

07:27.066 --> 07:29.533
Oh, and Elmo will use
these party hats

07:29.533 --> 07:32.000
to make the dragon's
spiky back.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.700
And I'll use these
paper towel rolls
to make the horns.

07:34.700 --> 07:35.700
Cool!

07:35.700 --> 07:38.367
Grover:
And I got the fabric. Ahh!

07:39.934 --> 07:41.433
- Ohh.
- Oh, boy.

07:41.433 --> 07:43.133
Ooh, boy.

07:43.133 --> 07:44.333
Oh, are you okay?

07:44.333 --> 07:46.166
Uhh.
I don't know.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.066
I see spots!
I see spots!

07:48.066 --> 07:49.700
Aah! Aah!

07:49.700 --> 07:51.367
Oh, yeah, I am okay.
Ha ha ha.

07:51.367 --> 07:54.066
This sheet is perfect
for the dragon's body.

07:54.066 --> 07:55.834
- Thank you, Grover.
- Oh, yeah.

07:55.834 --> 07:57.300
- You are welcome.
- Ha ha ha!

07:57.300 --> 07:59.867
Abby:
Wow. Hey, Nina.

07:59.867 --> 08:02.333
Now, how can we give
our dragon scales

08:02.333 --> 08:04.200
like the one
in the picture?

08:04.200 --> 08:05.834
Oh! With these.

08:05.834 --> 08:08.934
It's sticker time, people!
Ha ha ha!

08:08.934 --> 08:11.033
Oh, how about we write
our hopes and wishes

08:11.033 --> 08:13.500
for the new year on them,
like they do in China?

08:13.500 --> 08:14.934
Ooh, I like it.
I like it.

08:14.934 --> 08:17.266
Grover, that's
my favorite part.

08:17.266 --> 08:19.133
Oh, Elmo doesn't know
how to write yet,

08:19.133 --> 08:20.900
so he will draw his wishes.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.533
- Perfect.
- Let's see here.

08:22.533 --> 08:26.767
Elmo wishes for something
nice for Nina.

08:26.767 --> 08:30.133
I want to play with
my brother Rudy more.

08:30.133 --> 08:34.934
World peace,
goodwill towards all, and...

08:36.433 --> 08:38.333
a pencil sharpener.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.500
Ha ha!

08:44.500 --> 08:46.633
This is one
good-looking dragon.

08:46.633 --> 08:48.900
Yeah! This is
gonna be great.

08:48.900 --> 08:50.533
Abby: Yeah.

08:50.533 --> 08:52.767
I don't know.
Something is missing.

08:52.767 --> 08:53.934
Abby: Hmm.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.467
I can't see
what it is.

08:55.467 --> 08:56.867
♪ Dum dee dum
dum dum ♪

08:56.867 --> 09:00.266
Whoa! Look at-- wait.
Why dragon have no eyes?

what you need,

09:04.667 --> 09:06.667
you need something round.

09:06.667 --> 09:10.133
Yeah, you know, like,
like, cookie.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.166
No, no, no.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:12.166 --> 09:14.033

Oh, come on,
Cookie Monster, please.

09:16.066 --> 09:17.367
Yeah,
we need your help.

09:17.367 --> 09:18.467

He observes.

14:21.700 --> 14:23.600
He questions.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.433
He investigates.

14:25.433 --> 14:27.767
What does this button do? Whoa!

14:27.767 --> 14:29.767
Announcer:
Super Grover 2.0.

14:29.767 --> 14:32.800
He shows up.

14:34.400 --> 14:37.767
Somewhere by a woodland stream,
one little duckling is

14:37.767 --> 14:40.367
about to waddle into
a big problem.

14:40.367 --> 14:42.734
Ha! Yippee!

14:42.734 --> 14:45.333
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

14:45.333 --> 14:47.367
I can't wait to get
to the party.

14:47.367 --> 14:49.834
It's going
to be so much fun.

14:49.834 --> 14:51.166
Ohh!

14:51.166 --> 14:52.667
A stream?

14:52.667 --> 14:55.667
And the party is
on the other side!

14:55.667 --> 14:58.900
Oh, no! How will
I ever get across?

14:58.900 --> 15:01.200
Help, help!

15:01.200 --> 15:02.767
Grover: Aah!

15:02.767 --> 15:04.033
Ohh, ohh!

15:04.033 --> 15:05.633
Super Grover 2.0!

15:05.633 --> 15:06.900
You showed up.

15:06.900 --> 15:09.033
Unh! It is what I do.

15:09.033 --> 15:11.500
So what seems to be
the problem, little one?

15:11.500 --> 15:13.400
I'm trying to get
to that party over there,

15:13.400 --> 15:15.967
but I don't know how
to get across the stream.

15:15.967 --> 15:21.300
First, I shall unleash
the power of observation.

15:21.300 --> 15:22.834
Mmm!

15:22.834 --> 15:24.300
Oh, I don't want
to miss the party.

15:24.300 --> 15:28.900
Hmm. I see with my super eyes
that you walk like a duck.

15:28.900 --> 15:30.166
Quack!

15:30.166 --> 15:31.300
Aah! And I hear
with my super ears

15:31.300 --> 15:32.800
that you quack
like a duck.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.200
Quack!

15:34.200 --> 15:36.834
My super powers of observation
tell me you are a duck.

15:36.834 --> 15:38.033
Of course I'm a duck.

15:38.033 --> 15:39.300
Quack!

15:39.300 --> 15:41.066
Well, then do not
be daffy, duck.

15:41.066 --> 15:42.533
You can swim
across the stream.

15:42.533 --> 15:44.667
Everyone knows
that ducks can swim.

15:44.667 --> 15:47.567
Well, yes,
but if I swim across,

15:47.567 --> 15:50.233
I'll ruin
my brand-new party shoes.

15:50.233 --> 15:51.333
Look.

15:51.333 --> 15:52.400
Stunning!

15:52.400 --> 15:54.667
If only there were
a bridge here.

15:54.667 --> 15:56.133
What's that, now?

15:56.133 --> 15:58.967
You know, something sturdy
and dry that connects

15:58.967 --> 16:01.300
one side of a stream
to the other side.

16:01.300 --> 16:04.166
Oh, you mean
a crossy over-thing.

16:04.166 --> 16:05.633
What good would that do?

16:05.633 --> 16:06.834
Well, I could walk
across it

16:06.834 --> 16:08.934
without my shoes
getting wet.

16:08.934 --> 16:10.567
Ah! Well,
then stand back,

16:10.567 --> 16:15.200
for I, Super Grover 2.0,
will now unleash

16:15.200 --> 16:17.900
the power of engineering
and design you

16:17.900 --> 16:20.166
a crossy-over thing.

16:20.166 --> 16:21.367
You mean a bridge.

16:21.367 --> 16:22.533
Yeah. Whatever.

16:22.533 --> 16:23.633
Ahh.

16:23.633 --> 16:24.834
♪ Design, design, design ♪

16:24.834 --> 16:27.100
And ta-da!

16:27.100 --> 16:28.834
A bridge made
of broccoli?

16:28.834 --> 16:30.867
Yes! It is the latest
in green design.

16:30.867 --> 16:32.400
What do you think?

16:32.400 --> 16:34.266
Well, I don't think
that broccoli is
the right thing

16:34.266 --> 16:35.934
to make a bridge out of,
Super Gro...

16:35.934 --> 16:36.967
Of course it is!

16:36.967 --> 16:38.400
...ver.

16:38.400 --> 16:39.934
Now let me check
my utility sock.

16:39.934 --> 16:41.333
There must be one
here somewhere.

16:42.734 --> 16:44.233
Huh? What is this
wooden roundy thingy

16:44.233 --> 16:45.967
doing in my sock?

16:45.967 --> 16:48.266
Hey. Maybe we could
use that.

16:48.266 --> 16:49.467
Do not be silly.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.000
This is not broccoli.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.467
I know. It's a log,
Super Grover,

16:54.467 --> 16:56.400
and it looks like it
might be long enough

16:56.400 --> 16:58.667
to stretch
across the stream.

16:58.667 --> 16:59.900
Not now,
little waddler.

16:59.900 --> 17:02.166
First...

17:02.166 --> 17:04.834
I must find that
pesky vegetable.

17:04.834 --> 17:07.934
I guess I'll just build
the bridge myself, then.

17:07.934 --> 17:10.600
I can just push this log.

17:10.600 --> 17:12.533
The broccoli.

17:12.533 --> 17:15.200
Ahh. Super Grover,
I did it!

17:15.200 --> 17:18.200
I engineered
a bridge with the log.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.166
It was long enough!

17:20.166 --> 17:22.300
Okay.
Let's see if this works.

17:22.300 --> 17:23.867
Ahh.

17:23.867 --> 17:28.333
I'll start on this side
and waddle, waddle, waddle,

17:28.333 --> 17:32.867
waddle, waddle, waddle,
waddle to the other side

17:32.867 --> 17:35.467
without getting
my shoes wet.

17:35.467 --> 17:36.900
Ha!

17:36.900 --> 17:37.967
It worked.

17:37.967 --> 17:39.600
Now I can go to the party!

17:39.600 --> 17:41.633
Thanks for the log,
Super Grover!

17:41.633 --> 17:43.767
Ahh. Do not thank me,
you lucky duckie!

17:43.767 --> 17:45.300
Enjoy the party!

Announcer:
And so our hero learned
that an engineer needs

17:47.300 --> 17:50.066
the right size and shape
materials to solve a problem.

Well, it looks as though
my work here is done.

21:56.667 --> 22:01.533
like Fourth of July,
Halloween, or Christmas.

22:01.533 --> 22:03.700
Sometimes people wear
special clothes

22:03.700 --> 22:05.600
and make special food.

about celebrations.

22:41.400 --> 22:45.233

23:11.633 --> 23:14.767
and stripes
and polka dots, stripes.

23:14.767 --> 23:17.233
Which one of these hats
comes next?

23:17.233 --> 23:18.300
This one?

23:18.300 --> 23:20.400
Child:
No! That's not it.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.133
Child #2:
That hat has zigzags.

23:22.133 --> 23:23.867
Elmo:
Oh, get out of here, hat.

23:23.867 --> 23:26.867
So which hat really
goes here?

23:26.867 --> 23:28.367
Child #3:
The polka dot one.

Oh, does Mr. Noodle
celebrate anything?

23:49.767 --> 23:52.333

Some celebrations
have decorations.

24:19.734 --> 24:23.767
Ha ha ha!
He decorated himself.

24:23.767 --> 24:26.200
Oh, Mr. Noodle!

24:26.200 --> 24:29.533
A celebration isn't when
you decorate yourself.

24:29.533 --> 24:32.667
No, it's when you throw
a party for something.

24:34.066 --> 24:37.166
Child #2:
Try again, Mr. Noodle.

24:37.166 --> 24:39.433
