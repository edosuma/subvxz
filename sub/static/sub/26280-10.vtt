The Big Bang Theory...

00:03.046 --> 00:06.267
Actually, I-I need to talk to
both of you about your paper.

00:06.310 --> 00:09.139
Oh, right, how are
the citations coming?Um...

00:09.183 --> 00:12.403
We came a-across
a-a Russian paper

00:12.447 --> 00:14.753
that seems to disprove
super-asymmetry.

00:19.062 --> 00:20.672
[screams]

00:23.240 --> 00:25.721
Okay, Sheldon and Amy
are still pretty upset

00:25.764 --> 00:27.375
about their theory
being disproved.

00:27.418 --> 00:30.073
So we have made
a list of subjects

00:30.117 --> 00:31.248
for everyone
to avoid.

00:31.292 --> 00:33.076
Symmetry.Asymmetry.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.034
Uh, SimCity--

00:34.077 --> 00:35.818
sounds too much like symmetry.

00:35.861 --> 00:37.689

That also applies

00:37.733 --> 00:39.735
to The Simpsons,
Simba from The Lion King,

00:39.778 --> 00:40.953
and cymbals.

00:40.997 --> 00:43.956
Russia or Russian
in any context.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.002
The country, the dressing,
the roulette.

00:47.395 --> 00:49.919
Uh, also no talk of Rocky IV.

00:49.962 --> 00:51.660
Why Rocky IV?

00:51.703 --> 00:53.096
Because he fights
a Russian.

00:53.140 --> 00:56.621
I'm sorry about her.
[chuckles]

00:56.665 --> 00:58.449
We should just try and avoid
anything that makes them think

00:58.493 --> 01:00.364
of their project
or science

01:00.408 --> 01:03.280
or Nobel Prizes
or successes or failures.

you hate asparagus.

02:13.045 --> 02:15.222
I thought so, too, but I also
thought super-asymmetry

02:15.265 --> 02:17.311
was a good idea,
so what else am I wrong about?

02:17.354 --> 02:20.575
Oh, so now you're
reevaluating

02:20.618 --> 02:22.185
every opinion you've ever had?

02:22.229 --> 02:24.535
Yes. I am following the example

02:24.579 --> 02:26.755
of 17th century philosopher
René Descartes.

02:26.798 --> 02:28.322
He subjected
all his beliefs

02:28.365 --> 02:30.889
to radical doubt so that he
could build a bedrock belief

02:30.933 --> 02:34.154
and build his cognitive life
back up on firm principles.

02:34.197 --> 02:36.547
Ugh! Still yucky, still yucky.

Sheldon, I know you're upset
about the paper, okay.

02:42.640 --> 02:43.815
I'm upset, too.

02:43.859 --> 02:45.730
I mean, I was so sure
we were right.

02:45.774 --> 02:47.993
Every fiber of my being
felt like this was it.

02:48.037 --> 02:51.040
This was the one. How can I
trust my instincts anymore?

02:51.083 --> 02:52.868
Well, just because
our theory was wrong,

02:52.911 --> 02:55.131
that doesn't mean you're wrong
about everything.

02:55.175 --> 02:58.003
Doesn't it? I've always thought
I hated jazz, maybe I was wrong.

02:58.047 --> 03:00.180

I'm not sharing the steak.

about Sheldon.

03:35.127 --> 03:36.999
I've never seen him this down.

03:37.042 --> 03:38.957
Have you tried making him
a cup of tea?

03:39.001 --> 03:42.178
He's reevaluated tea.

03:43.310 --> 03:46.269
Now he thinks it's nothing
but leaf soup.

I'm afraid so. I just...
I don't know what to do.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.372
I have something
that might help.

04:02.416 --> 04:05.375
It's-it's a recording
of the only person

04:05.419 --> 04:08.465
whose opinion Sheldon
actually respects.

Feynman?

04:11.163 --> 04:12.991
No, himself.

It's a pep talk he made
when he was a kid.

04:16.908 --> 04:19.520
He gave it to me years ago
and told me to save it

04:19.563 --> 04:21.086
for a real emergency.

04:21.130 --> 04:22.914
What?
You didn't break it out

04:22.958 --> 04:24.960
when he declared his room
a sovereign nation

04:25.003 --> 04:27.876
and waged a trade war
against us?

04:27.919 --> 04:31.575

I didn't want that anyway.

04:36.580 --> 04:37.973

Yeah, Amy asked if we
had one she could borrow

it still works.

What's on the tape?

04:44.501 --> 04:47.199

a lot of Jeopardy!for my mom,

and you see some naked people...

a member of the Magic Castle.

you auditioned there.

Oh, I never went
through with it.

05:18.927 --> 05:21.625
I watched the tape and realized
I wasn't good enough.

05:21.669 --> 05:24.846
You know that trick where
you saw a mannequin in half?

05:24.889 --> 05:27.675

called magic dumb.

on poles.

of the emblem world.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.558
that I think
might cheer you up.

06:24.601 --> 06:27.909
It is the emergency pep talk
you made when you were a kid.

06:27.952 --> 06:30.564
Oh, that.

stop making Star Wars movies.

ever gonna happen.

Back to the Future II,

06:46.057 --> 06:48.669
where Marty McFly gets a glimpse
of his future self

06:48.712 --> 06:50.148
and that got me thinking,

06:50.192 --> 06:52.890
the day may come
where I needed my help,

06:52.934 --> 06:55.893
like they did with that movie.
That was not great.

it's really you watching this

07:30.450 --> 07:34.062

what am I thinking of?

07:34.105 --> 07:35.542

nothing matters.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.969

I can do?

08:12.013 --> 08:14.319
Yes. You can build me
a time machine

08:14.363 --> 08:16.539
so I can go back and tell my
younger self to give up, because

08:16.583 --> 08:18.236
nothing's gonna work out
the way he wants.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.242

of leaf soup.

08:36.385 --> 08:38.430
Your magic tricks
from the garage.

08:38.474 --> 08:42.130
Your wands, your top hat
with the stuffed mouse inside.

08:42.173 --> 08:43.871
I never had a stuffed mouse.

08:43.914 --> 08:46.177

in the living room?

want this, and I can help you.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.505

how to present yourself,

09:11.551 --> 09:13.727
connect with the judges,
sabotage the competition.

09:13.770 --> 09:15.946
Whoa, whoa, no one's
sabotaging anybody.

Of course not.

the pageant mom to you

09:24.955 --> 09:26.348
that my mom was to me.

09:26.391 --> 09:28.611
I thought you hated your mom
for making you do that.

09:28.655 --> 09:31.396
More talk like that and
you're not getting any dinner.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.964

I need your
professional advice.

09:49.763 --> 09:51.286
Well, I'd love
to help you out, dear,

09:51.329 --> 09:53.201
but I'm very busy at the moment.

09:53.244 --> 09:55.507
Perhaps we can schedule
a time next week.

09:55.551 --> 09:56.639
It's about Sheldon.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.119
Oh, well, I-I suppose

09:58.162 --> 09:59.947
I can spare a minute or two.

09:59.990 --> 10:02.732
Wh-Why did you just say
you're too busy, but...

10:02.776 --> 10:05.996
Leonard, please,
not everything is about you.

10:07.998 --> 10:09.391
Penny, go on.

10:09.434 --> 10:12.046
Well, ever since his
paper got disproven,

10:12.089 --> 10:13.134
he's been a wreck.

10:13.177 --> 10:15.963
He's been sad
and... and angry.

10:16.006 --> 10:18.008
He just seems
kind of broken.

10:18.052 --> 10:20.228
Well, it sounds
like he may be grieving.

10:20.271 --> 10:21.098
Really?

10:21.142 --> 10:22.360
Over a theory?Of course.

10:22.404 --> 10:24.711
You can grieve
over any emotional loss.

10:24.754 --> 10:26.277
The more you care
about something,

10:26.321 --> 10:28.497
the greater the trauma
of losing it.

10:28.540 --> 10:30.499
Oh, boy.
He cared about this a lot.

10:30.542 --> 10:32.675
Yeah. What can we do
to help him?

10:32.719 --> 10:34.895
Well, grieving is a process.

10:34.938 --> 10:37.898
Every culture has its own
rituals and traditions

10:37.941 --> 10:39.900
to facilitate mourning.

10:39.943 --> 10:42.903
The ancient Egyptians
had their mummification,

10:42.946 --> 10:45.775
the Tibetans had
their sky funerals...

10:45.819 --> 10:48.082
And when I was little and my dog
died, my mom sat me down

10:48.125 --> 10:50.214
and very gently told me
that she wished the truck

10:50.258 --> 10:52.521
had hit my dad instead.

10:54.479 --> 10:56.220
I was trying
to lighten the mood.

10:56.264 --> 10:58.875
Your dog had just died.

11:02.096 --> 11:05.360
Howard and I have been working
really hard on his audition,

11:05.403 --> 11:07.231
so it'll be helpful to get
another set of eyes on it.

11:07.275 --> 11:09.190
Well, as someone who has
watched every episode

11:09.233 --> 11:10.365
of America's Got Talent,

11:10.408 --> 11:11.758
I'm getting pretty good
at telling

11:11.801 --> 11:13.760
when some American's got talent.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.370
Seriously,

11:15.413 --> 11:17.851
Heidi and I agree,
like, 90% of the time.

11:17.894 --> 11:19.461
All right.

11:19.504 --> 11:22.116
Don't be afraid to be
brutally honest.

11:22.159 --> 11:24.379
Like my mom used to say
when I was doing pageants,

11:24.422 --> 11:27.425
"Tears only make your eyes
sparkle brighter."

11:27.469 --> 11:29.819
That is both sad and true.

11:29.863 --> 11:32.213
Half my Instagram
is after a good cry.

11:32.256 --> 11:34.650
Howie, you ready?

11:34.694 --> 11:36.217
WOLOWITZ [flat]:
Yeah.

11:36.260 --> 11:40.700

Hello. I'm The Great Howdini
from Altadena, California.

12:21.653 --> 12:23.525
I have no brothers or sisters

12:23.568 --> 12:28.356
and my favorite thing to eat
is grilled cheese.

12:28.399 --> 12:29.749
When does the magic start?

12:29.792 --> 12:33.361
It already started.

12:34.579 --> 12:36.581
Hey.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.540
Hi. How are
you guys doing?

12:38.583 --> 12:40.411
A little better,
if you can believe it.

12:47.157 --> 12:48.028
Sheldon?

12:48.071 --> 12:50.247
[muffled]:
Go away.

12:50.291 --> 12:52.336
Buddy, come on, let us help you.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.338
The only person
who could help me was erased

12:54.382 --> 12:56.340
by the Medford High Wolves.

12:56.384 --> 12:59.126
Oh, that's funny. My high
school was also the wolves.

12:59.169 --> 13:01.432
No? Not now? Okay.

13:01.476 --> 13:03.478
LEONARD: Look,
t-this might

13:03.521 --> 13:05.262
seem strange, but, uh,

13:05.306 --> 13:07.743
we thought it might help you get
some closure if you had a chance

13:07.787 --> 13:09.614
to properly say good-bye
to your paper.

13:09.658 --> 13:11.094
Yeah, you know, we
could say a few words,

13:11.138 --> 13:12.704
you could talk about
what it meant to you

13:12.748 --> 13:14.794
and-and we could
bury it somewhere.

13:14.837 --> 13:17.231
You mean have a funeral
for our theory?

13:17.274 --> 13:18.275
Yeah.

13:18.319 --> 13:19.668
That's ridiculous.

13:19.711 --> 13:22.149
I thought so, too, but my mom
thought it might work.

13:22.192 --> 13:25.195
Beverly thought it would help?
We should try it.

13:25.239 --> 13:27.502
Wha-- How come when you thought
it was my idea...

13:27.545 --> 13:28.895
SHELDON:
[stammers] Leonard,

13:28.938 --> 13:30.722
please, this is not about you.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.988
I guess we could bury it
in the park.

13:35.031 --> 13:36.990
Yeah, where dogs do their
business and other dogs

13:37.033 --> 13:39.122
sniff that business?
I don't think so.

13:39.166 --> 13:41.559
What would you
like to do, Sheldon?

13:43.648 --> 13:46.303
The only fitting send-off:

13:46.347 --> 13:47.652
a Viking funeral.

13:47.696 --> 13:49.437
You mean, like,
push it out into a lake

13:49.480 --> 13:51.134
and shoot it
with a flaming arrow?

13:51.178 --> 13:54.224
This guy gets it.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.052
How about a bathtub
and a match?

13:56.096 --> 13:58.881
How about a bathtub
and a flaming arrow?

13:58.925 --> 14:02.276
How about a bathtub, a match
and an ice-cold Yoo-hoo after?

14:02.319 --> 14:04.844
Sold.

14:06.323 --> 14:08.238
[sighs]

14:08.282 --> 14:11.024
Would you like to say something?

14:11.067 --> 14:13.026
Y-Yes, thank you.

14:13.069 --> 14:17.334
I know this is just
a scientific theory,

14:17.378 --> 14:19.293
but to me, it was
more than that.

14:19.336 --> 14:22.905
It described the universe
in a new and beautiful way.

14:22.949 --> 14:26.343
I want that to be the
universe we live in,

14:26.387 --> 14:28.693
but I guess it's not.

14:28.737 --> 14:32.654
Amy, would you like
to shoot the arrow?

14:46.363 --> 14:48.496
It's kind of beautiful,
isn't it?

14:48.539 --> 14:51.238
Yeah, it is.

14:55.372 --> 14:57.418
It's getting kind of
close to the curtain.

14:57.461 --> 14:58.593
It's in water, it's fine.

14:58.636 --> 15:00.856
Oh!
Oh!

15:00.900 --> 15:02.945
Oh!

15:02.989 --> 15:05.252
Looks like we both had theories
that were wrong.PENNY: Okay...

15:10.126 --> 15:11.475
Are you getting sick?

15:11.519 --> 15:14.870
No, I have glitter in my nose.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.872
Just your nose?

15:16.916 --> 15:18.830
Consider yourself lucky.

15:18.874 --> 15:20.702
Hey, I'm gonna

15:20.745 --> 15:22.008
take tomorrow off

15:22.051 --> 15:24.053
so we can spend the whole day
running the act.

15:24.097 --> 15:28.623
You know what, it has been
so much fun working on this

15:28.666 --> 15:29.929
with you, but...But what?

15:29.972 --> 15:31.365
It hasn't.

15:32.540 --> 15:34.237
I'm not gonna audition.

15:34.281 --> 15:36.500
Hey, I didn't raise a quitter.

15:36.544 --> 15:38.154
You didn't raise me at all.

15:38.198 --> 15:40.635
Look,

15:40.678 --> 15:43.203
I get that you're scared, but
we just have to push past that.

15:43.246 --> 15:45.422
I'm not scared.
I don't like the act.

15:45.466 --> 15:46.815
It's over-the-top

15:46.858 --> 15:50.775
and weird and has more
jazz hands than magic.

15:50.819 --> 15:52.734
Why didn't you say
something earlier?

15:52.777 --> 15:55.215
You seemed like
you were so happy,

15:55.258 --> 15:56.651
and then when I tried
to say something,

15:56.694 --> 15:59.523
you seemed like you were so mad.

15:59.567 --> 16:01.482
Hey, this isn't about me.

16:01.525 --> 16:03.092
I just wanted you
to have your dream,

16:03.136 --> 16:04.746
and I wanted
to control everything

16:04.789 --> 16:08.271
about how you looked and acted
so that your victory was mine.

16:08.315 --> 16:12.275
Well, that's honest.

16:12.319 --> 16:14.930
But if I'm gonna
go through with this,

16:14.974 --> 16:16.758
I have to do it my own way.

16:16.801 --> 16:18.716
I respect that,

16:18.760 --> 16:20.718
and I'm glad that I helped
lead you to this moment.

16:20.762 --> 16:23.330
Stop trying to make this
your victory!

16:24.548 --> 16:26.550
[crowd cheering, whistle blowing
over TV]

16:36.386 --> 16:38.910
Why are you watching that?

16:38.954 --> 16:40.042
I'm just looking to see

16:40.086 --> 16:42.001
if there's anything left
of your speech.

16:42.044 --> 16:44.742
It's not important.
I remember everything I said.

16:44.786 --> 16:46.440
And?

16:46.483 --> 16:50.270
It was good, it just would've
meant more coming from me.

16:52.054 --> 16:54.752
All right, bring it in.

16:54.796 --> 16:55.927
Is that your dad?

16:55.971 --> 16:57.712
It is.

16:57.755 --> 17:00.062
I've only seen pictures of him.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.978
I know we're down, by a lot.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.241
And if I'm being
honest with you,

17:05.285 --> 17:07.330
we're probably not
gonna win this one.

17:07.374 --> 17:11.987
In fact, we're definitely not
gonna win this one.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.685
Do you want me to turn it off?

17:14.729 --> 17:17.036
But we're not
gonna quit, either.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.428
And if we do lose,

17:18.472 --> 17:21.736
you need to know
that doesn't make you losers.

17:21.779 --> 17:25.740
You learn as much about who you
are and what you're made of

17:25.783 --> 17:29.048
from failing as you do
from success.

17:29.091 --> 17:32.051
Maybe more.

17:32.094 --> 17:35.445
So you can spend the next half
feeling sorry for yourselves,

17:35.489 --> 17:38.100
or you can get out there
and give them hell.

17:38.144 --> 17:40.015
Yeah! Let's give them hell!

17:40.059 --> 17:43.105
Oh-- watch your mouth,
your mom might...

17:43.149 --> 17:45.586
I remember that game.

17:45.629 --> 17:48.023
Did they win?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.981
Oh, no.

17:50.025 --> 17:51.548
No, they lost so bad,
the other team

17:51.592 --> 17:55.596
let one of their cheerleaders
try to kick a field goal.

17:55.639 --> 17:59.165
Well, that was a nice speech.
Too bad it didn't work.

17:59.208 --> 18:01.428
Maybe it did.

18:01.471 --> 18:04.170
What do you mean?

18:04.213 --> 18:05.867
I've been acting
like the game is over,

18:05.910 --> 18:08.391
but it's only halftime.

18:08.435 --> 18:11.133
And there's a lot more physics
left to play.

18:11.177 --> 18:16.051
Wow, was that your first ever
sports metaphor?

18:16.095 --> 18:19.141
It was.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.578
And I think it was a home run.

18:24.712 --> 18:27.018
That's two.

18:27.062 --> 18:29.717
It's interesting.

18:29.760 --> 18:33.112
I've always thought that
my father's journey and my own

18:33.155 --> 18:38.465
were so different, but he also
faced failure and setbacks.

18:38.508 --> 18:43.122
Maybe our lives mirrored each
other more than I thought.

18:43.165 --> 18:47.430
So, from one viewpoint,

18:47.474 --> 18:50.912
you and your father's lives
are asymmetrical,

18:50.955 --> 18:56.047
but from another vantage point,
they're symmetrical.

18:56.091 --> 18:57.745
Sheldon,

18:57.788 --> 19:02.184
what if symmetry and asymmetry
are observer-relative?

19:02.228 --> 19:05.405
That would mean that
the Russian paper was right...

19:05.448 --> 19:08.277
But only from one perspective.

19:08.321 --> 19:11.280
If we look at it from a deeper
view in more dimensions,

19:11.324 --> 19:13.195
our theory still stands.

19:13.239 --> 19:16.677
Not only stands, i-it might be
an even bigger idea

19:16.720 --> 19:18.896
than the one we were
originally proposing.

19:18.940 --> 19:21.029
Go get your laptop.
We have a paper to fix.

19:21.072 --> 19:22.117
[chuckles]:
Okay.

19:26.904 --> 19:30.343
Thanks, Dad.

19:30.386 --> 19:32.040
We're gonna give them hell.

19:41.092 --> 19:43.051
Hi, I'm The Great Howdini,

19:43.094 --> 19:45.401
and it's an honor to be
auditioning at the Magic Castle.

19:45.445 --> 19:47.838
Could I borrow your watch, sir?

19:47.882 --> 19:49.753
Sure.Thank you.

19:49.797 --> 19:53.627
Ooh, Rolex, fancy.
I'll get it right back to you.

19:53.670 --> 19:57.848
Observe:
one very expensive watch,

19:57.892 --> 20:00.634
one wooden mallet.

20:02.984 --> 20:05.160
Do I dare? I do.

20:09.251 --> 20:12.907
Would you be amazed if your
watch survived that pounding?

20:12.950 --> 20:15.997
I think you would-- behold.
