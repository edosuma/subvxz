00:03.237 --> 00:05.367
This gigantic pyramid in Antarctica

00:05.473 --> 00:08.213
would be the oldest
pyramid on our planet.

00:08.309 --> 00:10.909
It's possible that underneath the ice

00:11.012 --> 00:15.252
will be keys for us
to reclaim our ancient past.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.419
The Nazis were particularly interested

00:17.518 --> 00:19.218
in Antarctica.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.590
Saucers were coming up out of the water

00:21.689 --> 00:24.519
and were shooting them
with some sort of beam,

00:24.625 --> 00:26.155
literally cutting ships in half.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.360
Antarctica may hold lost remnants

00:28.462 --> 00:30.362
of an extraterrestrial civilization

00:30.464 --> 00:35.174
that existed there, thousands
and thousands of years ago.

00:35.269 --> 00:38.639
Since the dawn of civilization,

00:38.739 --> 00:42.669
mankind has credited its origins to gods

00:42.777 --> 00:45.607
and other visitors from the stars.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.713
What if it were true?

00:47.815 --> 00:50.815
Did extraterrestrial beings

00:50.918 --> 00:54.118
really help to shape our history?

00:54.221 --> 00:57.921
And if so, might the
ultimate proof be found

00:58.025 --> 01:02.385
when we uncover the
pyramids of Antarctica?

# Ancient Aliens 11x01 #
Pyramids of Antarctica
Original Air Date on May 6, 2016

01:34.528 --> 01:38.428
Stretching over
five million square miles,

01:38.532 --> 01:41.402
across the southernmost
reaches of the Earth,

01:41.502 --> 01:46.372
lies the coldest and most
isolated continent in the world,

01:46.474 --> 01:48.774
Antarctica.

01:51.245 --> 01:53.075
Because of its hostile climate,

01:53.180 --> 01:55.780
including average daily temperatures

01:55.883 --> 01:58.183
of minus 49 degrees Fahrenheit

01:58.285 --> 02:02.145
and wind speeds of
over 200 miles per hour,

02:02.256 --> 02:05.686
Antarctica remains largely untouched

02:05.793 --> 02:07.833
by mankind.

02:07.928 --> 02:10.458
According to historical records,

02:10.564 --> 02:13.874
modern man did not even
set foot on the continent

02:13.968 --> 02:16.568
until 1853,

02:16.670 --> 02:20.270
when ship captain Mercator Cooper landed

02:20.374 --> 02:21.874
on what is now known as

02:21.976 --> 02:25.136
the Oates Coast of Victoria Land.

02:25.246 --> 02:29.846
Today, anywhere from
1,000 to 5,000 people

02:29.950 --> 02:34.390
reside at the research stations
scattered across the continent,

02:34.455 --> 02:37.415
braving the extreme conditions
in hopes of learning more

02:37.525 --> 02:40.325
about this mysterious landscape.

02:44.465 --> 02:46.765
The thing about Antarctica

02:46.867 --> 02:50.367
is that as much as 98% of it

02:50.471 --> 02:52.371
is covered in ice.

02:52.473 --> 02:55.073
And just occasionally,

02:55.176 --> 02:57.306
there are little areas that stick out--

02:57.411 --> 03:00.181
mountaintops, ridges, peaks.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.952
Antarctica is the least explored

03:04.051 --> 03:05.521
of the continents.

03:05.619 --> 03:06.749
Even the North Pole, which is just ice,

03:06.854 --> 03:08.524
has been explored more.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.489
It is a mystery, and it's
right here on the Earth.

03:10.558 --> 03:13.888
It's perhaps the last big
unexplored part

03:13.994 --> 03:15.834
of our home planet.

03:15.930 --> 03:19.730
Antarctica is a vast, frozen world

03:19.833 --> 03:23.473
and we know very little about it.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.671
And, in fact, the ice in Antarctica

03:25.773 --> 03:28.843
is up to three miles thick
in certain places.

03:28.943 --> 03:31.113
And what's beneath the ice

03:31.178 --> 03:34.178
is still largely a mystery
to scientists.

03:34.281 --> 03:36.421
You just have to imagine this.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.747
The Sears Tower is a little less

03:38.852 --> 03:41.152
under a third of a mile tall,

03:41.255 --> 03:43.615
so you have to imagine
that you can stack

03:43.724 --> 03:46.464
nine Sears Towers on top of each other

03:46.560 --> 03:48.490
and they would still not peek out

03:48.596 --> 03:50.526
from that ice sheet.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.466
Most geologists believe

03:54.568 --> 03:57.238
Antarctica has been completely frozen

03:57.338 --> 04:00.908
and uninhabited
for over 12 million years.

04:01.008 --> 04:04.208
But in 2012, new photographs

04:04.311 --> 04:06.651
revealed formations in the landscape

04:06.747 --> 04:09.007
that challenge this notion:

04:09.116 --> 04:12.116
Mysterious pyramid structures

04:12.219 --> 04:15.389
emerging from the now-melting ice.

04:16.857 --> 04:20.757
Recently there have been
a number of reports

04:20.861 --> 04:24.761
of pyramids being found on Antarctica.

04:24.865 --> 04:28.695
There are various photographs

04:28.802 --> 04:30.402
that show what appear to be

04:30.504 --> 04:33.114
perfect four-sided pyramids,

04:33.207 --> 04:38.877
very similar in design
to those at Giza, Egypt,

04:38.979 --> 04:40.949
and perhaps other places
around the world.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.884
While the photos were explained away

04:45.986 --> 04:48.346
by mainstream scientists

04:48.455 --> 04:51.615
as nothing more than natural
land formations...

04:51.725 --> 04:55.355
satellite imagery analysts
like Joseph White

04:55.462 --> 04:57.732
are not entirely convinced.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.271
In March of 2013,

05:00.367 --> 05:03.097
he uncovered
what he believes is evidence

05:03.170 --> 05:06.540
of yet another pyramid,
located just south

05:06.607 --> 05:10.577
of Antarctica's remote
Shackleton mountain range.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.708
I initially found the structure

05:12.813 --> 05:14.753
whilst looking on Google Earth.
I was in fact looking

05:14.848 --> 05:17.118
at some of the ra-rather strange
blank spots that you get

05:17.217 --> 05:20.717
in Antarctica, when I stumbled
on... upon this very large

05:20.821 --> 05:24.321
square structure which seems
to be some kind of building

05:24.425 --> 05:26.985
or perhaps even a pyramid,
but certainly,

05:27.094 --> 05:28.594
very large and very square.

05:28.696 --> 05:31.126
It actually lines up perfectly
with the coordinates

05:31.231 --> 05:34.471
of the compass:
north, south, east and west.

05:34.568 --> 05:37.638
And, uh, this dictates to me
that it's probably

05:37.738 --> 05:40.268
an intelligent structure,
because, uh, random structures,

05:40.374 --> 05:43.614
like mountains,
are not aligned to the compass.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.981
And another way we know
that, uh, a structure

05:46.080 --> 05:48.350
is not naturally occurring

05:48.449 --> 05:49.919
is generally to look for symmetry--

05:50.017 --> 05:53.117
things like right angles
and equilateral triangles

05:53.220 --> 05:57.060
and shapes that you would not
normally find in nature.

05:57.157 --> 05:58.987
This structure is-is exactly,

05:59.093 --> 06:00.963
uh, two kilometers square.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.931
And, uh, this corner to this corner

06:04.031 --> 06:06.061
is two kilometers and
this corner to this corner

06:06.166 --> 06:08.196
is also exactly two kilometers,

06:08.302 --> 06:11.072
which would make this
more than double the size

06:11.171 --> 06:13.671
of any pyramid thus far found on Earth.

06:15.776 --> 06:17.476
While it may seem unthinkable

06:17.578 --> 06:20.678
that pyramids could exist in Antarctica,

06:20.781 --> 06:24.121
in recent years, archaeologists
have found pyramids

06:24.218 --> 06:26.148
all over the world

06:26.253 --> 06:28.853
that had been lost for centuries,

06:28.956 --> 06:31.356
mistaken as natural formations

06:31.458 --> 06:35.128
or hidden in the most unlikely places.

06:35.229 --> 06:36.859
They have been discovered

06:36.964 --> 06:39.704
in the plains of northern Peru;

06:39.800 --> 06:43.770
buried beneath dirt
and rubble in Indonesia;

06:43.871 --> 06:45.771
and one may even exist

06:45.839 --> 06:48.069
in Los Angeles, California.

06:48.175 --> 06:50.175
All the way round the world

06:50.277 --> 06:53.277
we find evidence of pyramid structures.

06:53.380 --> 06:57.320
We should start
looking at the possibility

06:57.384 --> 07:01.094
that there was habitation on Antarctica.

07:01.188 --> 07:05.118
Was it a lost civilization?

07:05.225 --> 07:07.855
Could it be ancient astronauts?

07:07.961 --> 07:10.661
And just maybe

07:10.764 --> 07:13.574
the earliest monuments
of our own civilization

07:13.667 --> 07:16.897
came originally from Antarctica.

07:17.004 --> 07:20.544
If this gigantic pyramid in Antarctica

07:20.641 --> 07:23.581
is an artificial structure,

07:23.677 --> 07:27.547
it would probably be the
oldest pyramid on our planet.

07:27.648 --> 07:30.518
And, in fact, it might be
the master pyramid

07:30.617 --> 07:32.917
that all the other pyramids

07:33.020 --> 07:35.050
on planet Earth were designed,

07:35.155 --> 07:37.185
uh, to-to look like.

07:37.291 --> 07:40.331
There has been extensive research done

07:40.427 --> 07:42.657
on pyramids throughout the world,

07:42.763 --> 07:46.063
in terms of their structure and
what it is that they really are.

07:46.166 --> 07:49.726
And one of the theories is that
pyramids are power generators.

07:49.837 --> 07:53.567
And so, if you have these
pyramids strategically placed

07:53.674 --> 07:56.074
around the world,
generating this charge,

07:56.143 --> 07:58.143
it's possible to create

07:58.245 --> 08:01.145
a general standing wave around the world

08:01.248 --> 08:03.178
that is basically a wireless

08:03.283 --> 08:06.593
transmission of energy.

08:06.687 --> 08:10.557
It's been theorized that ancient ships,

08:10.657 --> 08:13.787
extraterrestrials and those
with high technology

08:13.861 --> 08:16.291
could use this interconnected

08:16.363 --> 08:19.133
wireless energy system

08:19.233 --> 08:21.903
to navigate around the planet

08:21.969 --> 08:24.669
and it makes sense that,

08:24.771 --> 08:28.541
if there was some kind of worldwide

08:28.642 --> 08:32.142
pyramid power grid like this,

08:32.246 --> 08:34.145
that Antarctica

08:34.248 --> 08:37.678
would have pyramids as well.

08:37.784 --> 08:41.323
The whole idea
of these pyramidal structures--

08:41.421 --> 08:43.921
where did it come from?

08:43.991 --> 08:45.991
'Cause it's not an arbitrary thing.

08:46.093 --> 08:48.333
And these structures,
they exist worldwide.

08:48.428 --> 08:50.928
So, you know, what was the impetus?

08:51.031 --> 08:52.301
What's the origin?

08:52.399 --> 08:54.729
And, even more fascinating,

08:54.835 --> 08:56.265
did they originate

08:56.370 --> 08:58.700
on the Antarctic continent?

09:01.875 --> 09:03.835
Might the pyramid

09:03.944 --> 09:06.014
Joseph White claims to have discovered

09:06.079 --> 09:07.909
near the Shackleton Mountain Range

09:08.015 --> 09:10.375
and other pyramid-shaped formations

09:10.484 --> 09:13.294
recently photographed in Antarctica

09:13.387 --> 09:16.957
provide evidence of
extraterrestrial visitation

09:17.057 --> 09:19.457
to our planet in the remote past?

09:21.194 --> 09:23.934
And if they are actually
man-made structures,

09:24.031 --> 09:26.701
how is such a thing even possible

09:26.800 --> 09:29.800
in a place that has been
buried beneath the ice

09:29.903 --> 09:32.673
for over 12 million years?

09:32.773 --> 09:35.873
According to ancient
astronaut theorists,

09:35.976 --> 09:39.406
Antarctica may not have
been a frozen continent

09:39.513 --> 09:44.283
for as long as mainstream
scientists suggest.

09:44.384 --> 09:47.324
And they say proof can be found

09:47.387 --> 09:52.287
by examining a 500-year-old map
depicting the continent...

09:52.392 --> 09:54.762
without any ice.

10:01.377 --> 10:05.047
Siberia, 2013.

10:05.114 --> 10:07.754
A wooly mammoth is discovered

10:07.850 --> 10:10.350
flash frozen in the glacial ice,

10:10.453 --> 10:12.393
engulfed so quickly

10:12.488 --> 10:17.218
that its blood and muscle tissue
are perfectly preserved.

10:17.293 --> 10:19.833
It is just one of dozens

10:19.929 --> 10:22.659
that have been found
within the Siberian ice

10:22.765 --> 10:25.565
since the turn of the 20th century.

10:25.668 --> 10:29.298
Many seemingly caught
in suspended animation,

10:29.372 --> 10:31.442
some with food in their mouths

10:31.540 --> 10:34.340
and vegetation in their stomachs

10:34.443 --> 10:37.483
that would only grow
in a much warmer climate.

10:37.546 --> 10:39.176
The discovery of a woolly mammoth

10:39.281 --> 10:40.811
that was flash frozen

10:40.916 --> 10:43.246
raises some interesting
scientific questions.

10:43.352 --> 10:46.092
Did something happen very
locally to the woolly mammoth

10:46.188 --> 10:47.818
that it froze very fast?

10:47.923 --> 10:49.723
But it does also raise the question

10:49.792 --> 10:51.762
of how quickly can climate
really change.

10:51.827 --> 10:54.457
And does it take some sort of cataclysm?

10:54.563 --> 10:56.833
One that's sudden and unexpected?

11:01.203 --> 11:03.803
In 1958,

11:03.906 --> 11:07.066
Charles Hapgood,
a Harvard-educated scientist,

11:07.176 --> 11:11.906
published the book,
Earth's Shifting Crust.

11:12.014 --> 11:16.524
In it, he proposed that
portions of the Earth's crust

11:16.619 --> 11:19.049
experienced violent and sudden shifts

11:19.155 --> 11:21.815
during Earth's geological history.

11:23.559 --> 11:27.329
His theory, known as
Crustal Displacement,

11:27.430 --> 11:29.230
posited that both Siberia

11:29.331 --> 11:32.431
and the continent of
Antarctica were located

11:32.468 --> 11:34.438
in slightly more temperate climates

11:34.537 --> 11:36.867
prior to the end of the last Ice Age,

11:36.972 --> 11:40.212
approximately 12,000 years ago.

11:40.276 --> 11:44.406
But then, some unknown
catastrophe plunged them

11:44.513 --> 11:46.183
into their current positions.

11:50.920 --> 11:53.520
Professor Hapgood came up with the idea

11:53.622 --> 11:57.392
that the previous
North Pole position had been

11:57.460 --> 11:59.490
in the area of the Hudson Bay.

11:59.595 --> 12:02.895
And then it shifted to
where the pole is today.

12:05.167 --> 12:07.397
And at the southern pole, he believes

12:07.503 --> 12:09.873
that the area of Antarctica

12:09.972 --> 12:14.542
had previously also experienced
a temperate climate,

12:14.610 --> 12:16.880
and that this was suddenly now thrust...

12:16.979 --> 12:23.019
into this deep ice and
this harsh, freezing climate.

12:23.085 --> 12:24.585
He believed the last time

12:24.687 --> 12:26.717
that this had actually taken place

12:26.789 --> 12:32.329
was approximately 12,000 years ago.

12:32.428 --> 12:34.288
When we think about
Earth crust displacement theory

12:34.396 --> 12:36.126
and plate tectonics,

12:36.232 --> 12:40.072
you want to think of the crust
basically floating on the magna

12:40.169 --> 12:43.339
and being able to shift
and move around on top of it.

12:43.405 --> 12:45.505
The Earth's crust
is not one solid piece.

12:45.574 --> 12:48.514
We know it's made of individual pieces.

12:48.611 --> 12:50.711
So, you could look and see

12:50.779 --> 12:52.849
how the continents probably
used to fit together

12:52.948 --> 12:55.378
and where they've moved,
and how they move apart

12:55.417 --> 12:57.147
over a long period of time.

12:57.219 --> 12:59.689
But the question is, you know,
would something the size

12:59.788 --> 13:02.088
of Antarctica shift suddenly,
or is that too big?

13:02.158 --> 13:05.958
These crustal shifts,
according to Hapgood,

13:06.028 --> 13:08.628
actually could happen
over a period of even days.

13:08.731 --> 13:12.101
And so, if you had
a thriving civilization,

13:12.201 --> 13:15.801
this crustal displacement could
have hit it very, very quickly,

13:15.871 --> 13:18.641
and so, it could have
actually been frozen

13:18.741 --> 13:21.311
over a very short period of time.

13:23.379 --> 13:25.679
Although Hapgood's theory of sudden,

13:25.748 --> 13:28.418
large-scale shifts of the Earth's crust

13:28.517 --> 13:30.447
was not widely accepted,

13:30.519 --> 13:33.019
renowned physicist Albert Einstein

13:33.122 --> 13:34.892
was "electrified" by it,

13:34.957 --> 13:39.557
and even wrote the foreword
of Hapgood's book.

13:39.662 --> 13:42.502
Hapgood would also find
additional support

13:42.598 --> 13:45.368
for his theory when, in 1960,

13:45.401 --> 13:48.701
while combing through the
Library of Congress archives,

13:48.771 --> 13:53.341
he unearthed an unusual map,
published in 1531.

13:53.409 --> 13:55.679
The map, credited

13:55.778 --> 13:59.848
to mathematician and
cartographer Oronteus Finaeus

13:59.915 --> 14:02.745
appears to depict an ice-free continent

14:02.851 --> 14:07.821
remarkably similar
to today's maps of Antarctica.

14:07.923 --> 14:12.133
It was not until as late as 1820

14:12.228 --> 14:17.198
that we had any real idea
of what Antarctica looked like.

14:17.299 --> 14:21.569
Yet, here, on the Oronteus
Finaeus map from 1531,

14:21.670 --> 14:23.540
here was Antarctica.

14:23.639 --> 14:25.909
How the hell is it possible

14:26.008 --> 14:30.938
that it could appear on this map?

14:31.046 --> 14:33.006
Researchers are baffled

14:33.115 --> 14:35.175
as to how the Oronteus Finaeus map

14:35.284 --> 14:37.024
could include a continent

14:37.119 --> 14:41.049
that was not discovered
until over 300 years later,

14:41.123 --> 14:43.023
and are even more perplexed

14:43.125 --> 14:48.125
by the fact that it depicts
Antarctica free of ice.

14:48.197 --> 14:53.067
If explorers somehow discovered
Antarctica in the 1500s,

14:53.168 --> 14:56.338
it would have been
completely frozen over.

14:56.438 --> 15:00.238
Remarkably,
the Finaeus map shows not only

15:00.309 --> 15:03.039
a detailed coastline free of ice,

15:03.112 --> 15:05.152
but the entire continent,

15:05.214 --> 15:08.284
including interior features
such as rivers,

15:08.384 --> 15:12.624
valleys and mountains.

15:12.721 --> 15:16.061
The map shows mountain ranges

15:16.158 --> 15:19.458
that have rivers coming out
of the mountain ranges.

15:19.561 --> 15:21.561
How could that be?

15:21.664 --> 15:24.064
It's frozen. It's ice.

15:24.133 --> 15:28.043
There's a NASA image of
the continent of Antarctica

15:28.103 --> 15:31.373
using radar so that
mountain ranges come through

15:31.473 --> 15:33.443
and can be seen.

15:33.542 --> 15:38.482
And you can see a mountain range
on one photograph,

15:38.547 --> 15:41.317
and on the Oronteus Finaeus map,
it's right there, too.

15:41.383 --> 15:43.383
It's the same mountain range.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.848
According to climatologists,

15:47.923 --> 15:50.693
the estimates of when this
feature would have been free

15:50.793 --> 15:55.503
from ice cover was
at least 6,000 years ago.

15:55.597 --> 15:59.797
So how is it possible
that this map exists?

15:59.902 --> 16:02.742
Did Finaeus have access to an older map?

16:02.838 --> 16:05.468
One dating back thousands of years?

16:07.643 --> 16:11.243
Perhaps more confounding,
U.S. Air Force cartographers

16:11.347 --> 16:15.117
that were sent the maps in the 1960s

16:15.184 --> 16:17.484
concluded that they were drawn

16:17.553 --> 16:19.753
using advanced spherical trigonometry

16:19.822 --> 16:22.792
with remarkable precision,
especially when considering

16:22.891 --> 16:25.691
the maps were made
hundreds of years ago.

16:25.728 --> 16:28.058
The fact that we find something that's

16:28.163 --> 16:30.863
a reference to modern-day
technology on a map

16:30.966 --> 16:33.296
that dates back to the 16th century,

16:33.369 --> 16:36.139
makes me think: is it possible

16:36.238 --> 16:40.508
that some type of advanced radar
technology was used?

16:40.609 --> 16:43.479
Because in order to produce a map

16:43.545 --> 16:46.605
that would outline the areas we see,

16:46.715 --> 16:51.075
you would have to be
at an altitude of 80 miles.

16:51.186 --> 16:54.216
So, how was that possible?

16:54.323 --> 16:59.393
Could it be that the basis
for these maps was gleaned

16:59.495 --> 17:02.895
from maps that were cartographed

17:02.998 --> 17:05.698
by extraterrestrial land surveyors?

17:07.336 --> 17:10.195
The implications of all this--

17:10.305 --> 17:14.665
and if you now are able
to add things like pyramids--

17:14.777 --> 17:18.037
this would really indicate
that there was some kind

17:18.146 --> 17:20.377
of ancient civilization in Antarctica.

17:20.482 --> 17:23.422
And that it would have been over
12,000 years ago.

17:23.519 --> 17:27.989
And you've got to wonder what
kind of civilization this was.

17:28.056 --> 17:31.156
Is it possible
that it was extraterrestrials?

17:33.061 --> 17:35.431
Could Antarctica have been inhabited

17:35.531 --> 17:39.101
by extraterrestrials
in the distant past?

17:39.201 --> 17:40.971
Did they study this continent

17:41.069 --> 17:43.599
and leave behind detailed information

17:43.705 --> 17:46.335
about its landscape?

17:46.408 --> 17:52.248
If so, just what happened
to these otherworldly visitors?

17:52.347 --> 17:55.077
Ancient astronaut theorists believe

17:55.150 --> 17:58.720
more clues can be found
in Egyptian stories

17:58.787 --> 18:03.217
describing an Earth-altering catastrophe.

18:12.558 --> 18:15.188
Edfu, Egypt.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.998
Located on the western bank of the Nile,

18:18.097 --> 18:20.967
the Temple of Edfu is one of the largest

18:21.034 --> 18:24.604
and most well preserved temples
of the ancient kingdom,

18:24.671 --> 18:30.111
dating back to 237 BC.

18:30.209 --> 18:33.309
The Edfu Temple
is of tremendous importance.

18:33.413 --> 18:37.213
As you enter the temple, it's
like you're going inside a book.

18:37.317 --> 18:38.717
It's literally full of texts--

18:38.818 --> 18:40.448
every wall, every column,

18:40.553 --> 18:44.123
every room, every chamber
is filled with text.

18:44.223 --> 18:46.793
They're known collectively
as the Edfu Texts.

18:46.859 --> 18:49.329
What is very interesting is that

18:49.395 --> 18:51.525
the majority of these texts
speak about the creation

18:51.631 --> 18:53.761
of the world.

18:57.036 --> 18:58.666
According to the texts,

18:58.771 --> 19:01.371
the Earth was created by powerful gods

19:01.474 --> 19:03.774
who came down from the sky,

19:03.843 --> 19:07.753
and these gods first established
a place known

19:07.847 --> 19:11.777
as the Island of the Egg.

19:11.851 --> 19:14.021
Two gods,

19:14.120 --> 19:19.960
they created an island in
the middle of the eternal lake.

19:20.026 --> 19:23.286
Creation started with that island.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.698
The occupants
of this so-called primordial,

19:27.800 --> 19:30.870
mythical world-- very strange creatures.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.467
There seems to be
three groups of people:

19:33.573 --> 19:36.743
one called the sages,

19:36.843 --> 19:39.343
one called the builders,

19:39.445 --> 19:40.775
and the other called the Shebtiu.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.150
Nobody knows who they are.

19:42.248 --> 19:44.248
These are the ones
that are very mysterious

19:44.350 --> 19:48.290
because they are said
to emerge from the water.

19:48.388 --> 19:52.758
Then the Egyptians believed
a series of gods came

19:52.825 --> 19:55.885
and built the first temples.

19:55.995 --> 19:59.025
It says that here the first
temples were-were built,

19:59.098 --> 20:01.528
the first ones ever in the world.

20:01.634 --> 20:04.374
And that these became the blueprint

20:04.470 --> 20:08.240
for every temple in Egypt.

20:08.341 --> 20:11.241
Once all the creator gods
have done their job

20:11.344 --> 20:13.844
with creating the world,

20:13.913 --> 20:18.483
they would meet with their big
bird and ascend to the sky.

20:18.551 --> 20:22.721
Ancient Egyptians believed
with all their heart

20:22.822 --> 20:27.762
that everything listed
and inscribed on these walls

20:27.827 --> 20:32.457
are true, true, true.

20:32.532 --> 20:36.032
If the walls say there's an
island in the middle of nowhere

20:36.135 --> 20:39.795
where gods would go
and ascend to the sky,

20:39.906 --> 20:43.066
then ancient Egyptians,
the devoted ones,

20:43.142 --> 20:45.882
would believe that island exists.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.610
According to the Edfu Texts,

20:50.716 --> 20:53.876
not all of the occupants left.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.816
And after many generations,

20:55.888 --> 20:58.888
the island suffered a terrible fate.

21:01.527 --> 21:03.457
The texts are very different

21:03.529 --> 21:07.799
as to what happens to the
occupants, these strange gods.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.900
They seem to...
once they have set the scene,

21:10.002 --> 21:12.072
once they have built the temples,

21:12.171 --> 21:16.771
they hand over their work
to the historical lineage,

21:16.876 --> 21:18.506
and then they depart.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.641
We don't know where they go.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.553
There seems to be something
very interesting here.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.375
There seems to be a war going on.

21:24.484 --> 21:26.724
The armies of these divinities

21:26.786 --> 21:28.786
is led by this falcon god.

21:28.888 --> 21:33.518
And he battles a kind of enemy
represented by a snake.

21:33.626 --> 21:38.096
In the skies appeared what
was known as the enemy snake.

21:38.164 --> 21:41.534
It had a name. It was called
the Great Leaping One.

21:41.601 --> 21:43.971
It was said
that immediately it appeared,

21:44.070 --> 21:46.570
there was a time of darkness.

21:46.672 --> 21:48.912
And there were suddenly floods

21:48.975 --> 21:52.875
that destroyed this sacred island.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.949
And when the waters receded,

21:55.047 --> 21:59.047
these original beings, who were
known as the Ancient Ones

21:59.152 --> 22:01.922
or the Elder Ones,

22:02.021 --> 22:05.361
were now no longer there.

22:05.424 --> 22:08.964
Perhaps the Great Leaping One,
this enemy snake,

22:09.028 --> 22:12.258
was the memory of the comet

22:12.331 --> 22:15.671
that entered
into our inner solar system,

22:15.768 --> 22:17.898
broke up,

22:17.970 --> 22:22.770
causing devastation and destruction.

22:25.645 --> 22:28.705
Might the account
of this ancient catastrophe

22:28.781 --> 22:31.551
inscribed on the walls
of the Edfu Temple

22:31.651 --> 22:34.991
be describing a natural event?

22:35.054 --> 22:37.924
Or was it a deliberate attack,

22:38.024 --> 22:42.494
an attack targeting
an otherworldly civilization

22:42.595 --> 22:47.325
existing on what we now know
as the Antarctic continent?

22:47.400 --> 22:49.630
We need to take a second look

22:49.735 --> 22:51.035
at the Edfu Texts and the story

22:51.137 --> 22:54.237
of the Island of the Egg because

22:54.307 --> 22:56.567
it's the source material
for Plato's story.

22:56.676 --> 23:00.406
In his story of Atlantis, he
gives a very important detail.

23:00.479 --> 23:04.049
He describes it as an immense island

23:04.116 --> 23:08.116
the size of Libya
and North Africa combined.

23:08.221 --> 23:11.561
Now, the thing about it is,
is that there's only one island

23:11.657 --> 23:14.057
on the planet that's out
in the middle of the ocean

23:14.126 --> 23:18.826
that matches that description,
and that's Antarctica.

23:21.133 --> 23:25.043
Curiously, the island continent depicted

23:25.137 --> 23:27.367
on the Oronteus Finaeus map

23:27.473 --> 23:29.673
reveals a shift of the South Pole

23:29.742 --> 23:32.012
of seven and a half degrees,

23:32.111 --> 23:36.751
or nearly 1,000 miles
from what it is today.

23:36.849 --> 23:40.179
Might this shift corroborate
the accounts

23:40.286 --> 23:44.656
of a major catastrophic event
in the remote past?

23:44.757 --> 23:49.057
If so, could the creation myth
recorded at Edfu

23:49.161 --> 23:53.931
be describing something more
than mythology?

23:54.033 --> 23:57.233
The cataclysm which would have
shifted Antarctica,

23:57.303 --> 24:00.703
this would have destroyed
the civilization that was there.

24:00.806 --> 24:02.866
And then, over time,

24:02.975 --> 24:05.605
whatever buildings and pyramids
that were there

24:05.711 --> 24:07.381
would be covered with ice.

24:08.914 --> 24:12.284
So the whole idea
that Antarctica is hiding,

24:12.385 --> 24:16.045
beneath its ice,
some ancient civilization

24:16.155 --> 24:18.855
is a very intriguing idea

24:18.924 --> 24:21.934
and one that may very well be true.

24:24.463 --> 24:27.203
Might there actually be evidence

24:27.300 --> 24:30.130
of an ancient extraterrestrial
civilization

24:30.202 --> 24:34.242
buried under the ice of Antarctica?

24:34.340 --> 24:38.080
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

24:38.177 --> 24:40.637
and believe that this long history

24:40.746 --> 24:44.106
of an alien presence there
is precisely what brought

24:44.183 --> 24:47.923
another occupying force
to its frozen shores--

24:48.020 --> 24:51.710
the Nazis.

24:52.984 --> 24:54.724
Hamburg, Germany.

24:54.819 --> 24:58.149
December, 1938.

24:58.256 --> 25:01.686
Four years into Adolf Hitler's
reign as Fuhrer,

25:01.759 --> 25:03.689
he is beginning to establish

25:03.761 --> 25:06.901
his total dictatorship
by taking direct control

25:06.998 --> 25:09.058
of the German military.

25:17.542 --> 25:20.442
But on the brink of World War II,

25:20.545 --> 25:24.005
Hitler is also involved
in much stranger endeavors

25:24.115 --> 25:26.175
that are hidden to the public.

25:26.250 --> 25:28.220
He is committing
every remaining resource

25:28.319 --> 25:32.049
to searching for ancient relics
that he believes

25:32.156 --> 25:34.356
could hold incredible powers.

25:36.561 --> 25:38.161
On December 17,

25:38.229 --> 25:40.699
the German freighter MS Schwabenland

25:40.798 --> 25:44.668
sets out on one
of these top secret missions.

25:44.769 --> 25:49.169
Its 33-member team is rumored
to include scientists,

25:49.273 --> 25:52.683
military experts, construction crews,

25:52.777 --> 25:55.437
and key members of the Thule Society,

25:55.546 --> 25:57.976
an elite group associated with the Nazis

25:58.049 --> 26:01.949
that focused on mysticism
and the occult.

26:02.053 --> 26:06.963
32 days later, they arrive
at their destination,

26:07.058 --> 26:10.588
Antarctica.

26:10.695 --> 26:13.755
The Nazis themselves were fascinated

26:13.865 --> 26:15.925
by ancient civilizations

26:16.033 --> 26:19.903
and legends of vanished super races.

26:20.004 --> 26:21.974
They were searching for

26:22.073 --> 26:24.173
this lost Arctic home

26:24.275 --> 26:26.705
that they thought that
the Aryans had come from.

26:26.811 --> 26:29.681
They were looking all over the world,

26:29.780 --> 26:31.780
and that included Antarctica.

26:31.849 --> 26:34.919
The Thule Society actually believed

26:35.019 --> 26:38.689
that they were mystics,
or channels, who were able

26:38.789 --> 26:40.559
to communicate with these beings

26:40.658 --> 26:43.488
who claimed to be either
extraterrestrial in origin

26:43.594 --> 26:46.064
or claimed to belong
to this, uh, civilization

26:46.163 --> 26:48.503
that lived in Earth's interior.

26:48.599 --> 26:51.129
They gave a lot of information

26:51.235 --> 26:54.135
about the building of advanced
aerospace vehicles,

26:54.238 --> 26:57.008
flying saucers,
and I think this is where,

26:57.108 --> 26:59.978
uh, Hitler's Nazi party
got a lot of its information

27:00.077 --> 27:01.777
about Antarctica--

27:01.879 --> 27:05.209
that, uh, in Antarctica there is
this ancient civilization,

27:05.316 --> 27:07.276
or bases where they could find

27:07.385 --> 27:10.115
a lot of these advanced technologies.

27:12.857 --> 27:15.117
During their time in Antarctica,

27:15.226 --> 27:17.586
the Nazis were believed to have mapped

27:17.695 --> 27:21.625
huge swaths of the icy landscape by air.

27:21.732 --> 27:25.132
Ancient astronaut theorists
believe they also established

27:25.236 --> 27:27.836
an elaborate underground headquarters

27:27.939 --> 27:31.509
known as Base 211.

27:31.609 --> 27:33.039
Hitler and the Nazis

27:33.144 --> 27:36.014
were particularly interested
in Antarctica.

27:36.113 --> 27:38.713
I think they really believed
that there were things going on

27:38.816 --> 27:40.546
deep under the ice.

27:40.651 --> 27:42.951
And there have always been
rumors that the Nazis,

27:43.054 --> 27:46.394
with their submarines,
have underwater caverns,

27:46.490 --> 27:49.630
small cities; that they escaped there

27:49.727 --> 27:52.357
after World War II.

27:52.463 --> 27:55.233
When the Germans got to Antarctica

27:55.333 --> 27:57.073
what they found were

27:57.168 --> 27:59.198
massive cities

27:59.303 --> 28:01.803
that were highly technological.

28:01.906 --> 28:05.206
And these buildings
were not just on the surface--

28:05.309 --> 28:07.809
they went deep down underground.

28:07.912 --> 28:11.112
So, they began relocating
a massive amount of equipment

28:11.215 --> 28:14.045
and personnel to Antarctica,

28:14.151 --> 28:17.091
repressurizing these ancient facilities

28:17.188 --> 28:19.188
and reoccupying them.

28:22.760 --> 28:24.730
In 1946,

28:24.829 --> 28:28.229
one year after the end of World War II,

28:28.332 --> 28:30.702
the U.S. government launched its own

28:30.801 --> 28:33.541
large-scale mission to Antarctica.

28:33.637 --> 28:37.307
Operation Highjump
deployed 4,700 troops,

28:37.408 --> 28:40.538
13 ships, an aircraft carrier,

28:40.644 --> 28:44.484
and a number of seaplanes to Antarctica.

28:44.548 --> 28:47.318
Although the government
denied it at the time,

28:47.418 --> 28:49.918
it would later become known that

28:50.021 --> 28:52.821
one of the operation's
primary objectives was

28:52.923 --> 28:56.663
"extending the United States'
sovereignty over the largest

28:56.761 --> 29:00.401
practicable area
of the Antarctic continent."

29:02.299 --> 29:05.799
The U.S. Navy, then,
sent what was basically

29:05.903 --> 29:09.773
a flotilla of armed ships to Antarctica.

29:09.874 --> 29:11.744
In Operation Highjump,

29:11.842 --> 29:14.612
there were stories
that were quite strange,

29:14.712 --> 29:17.252
that ultimately
came out of that expedition,

29:17.348 --> 29:19.178
which-which ended quite early.

29:19.283 --> 29:22.623
There were stories of craft coming up

29:22.720 --> 29:25.290
out of the water, around the ships,

29:25.389 --> 29:28.359
and of flying saucer-type vehicles.

29:28.459 --> 29:32.059
Saucers were coming up out of the water,

29:32.163 --> 29:35.963
and were shooting them
with some sort of beam,

29:36.067 --> 29:38.197
literally cutting ships in half.

29:38.302 --> 29:40.902
They were shooting planes
out of the sky.

29:41.005 --> 29:42.805
And they traveled so fast,

29:42.907 --> 29:44.837
that it was almost impossible

29:44.942 --> 29:47.012
to visually reference

29:47.111 --> 29:49.141
where the disk was going.

29:49.246 --> 29:51.576
So, the American fleet

29:51.682 --> 29:54.652
had to limp back to the United States,

29:54.752 --> 29:56.452
totally broken and destroyed.

29:57.788 --> 29:58.988
It's still a mystery,

29:59.090 --> 30:00.320
all of the activities

30:00.424 --> 30:01.824
that were going on in Antarctica.

30:01.926 --> 30:04.286
You have to wonder
if the American military,

30:04.395 --> 30:06.055
and other governments, too,

30:06.163 --> 30:08.503
are aware of structures under the ice,

30:08.599 --> 30:12.299
of pyramids beneath the ice;
and perhaps they know

30:12.403 --> 30:15.673
that there's some kind
of ancient civilization

30:15.773 --> 30:18.813
frozen beneath the ice of Antarctica.

30:21.445 --> 30:23.705
If, in fact, the Nazis were seeking

30:23.814 --> 30:26.854
extraterrestrial technology
in Antarctica,

30:26.951 --> 30:30.491
is it possible that they
actually discovered it?

30:30.588 --> 30:33.658
And might the U.S. military
have encountered

30:33.757 --> 30:36.927
this powerful technology years later,

30:36.994 --> 30:39.734
during Operation Highjump?

30:39.830 --> 30:42.300
Ancient astronaut theorists believe

30:42.399 --> 30:46.169
that further proof of an
alien presence in Antarctica

30:46.270 --> 30:49.340
may be found in a prehistoric lake

30:49.440 --> 30:53.140
buried under two miles of ice.

31:00.759 --> 31:02.959
Lake Vostok, Antarctica.

31:05.330 --> 31:07.500
Buried under two miles of ice

31:07.566 --> 31:11.226
is a 4,800-square-mile body of water.

31:11.336 --> 31:13.496
It is by far the largest

31:13.605 --> 31:15.935
of the continent's nearly 400 lakes

31:16.041 --> 31:19.111
that are entirely covered by ice.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.711
In 2001,

31:21.780 --> 31:25.080
pilots collecting data here
recorded unusual

31:25.184 --> 31:28.494
and extreme irregularities
in the magnetic field

31:28.587 --> 31:31.217
at the southeastern corner of the lake.

31:31.323 --> 31:34.063
Spanning a remarkable

31:34.159 --> 31:37.159
65 by 46 miles,

31:37.262 --> 31:39.662
the anomalous area is producing

31:39.765 --> 31:43.525
an unusually high level
of magnetic energy.

31:43.635 --> 31:47.365
This anomaly was roughly,
uh, 50 miles in diameter

31:47.473 --> 31:49.873
and was something that would be

31:49.975 --> 31:52.905
commensurate with the magnetic field

31:53.011 --> 31:55.011
being generated by a city.

31:57.216 --> 32:00.416
I have been
to Lake Vostok several times,

32:00.519 --> 32:02.449
as part of expedition research.
And when we were

32:02.554 --> 32:05.724
in the area, we did pick up
this magnetic anomaly.

32:05.824 --> 32:07.864
But we also found
other magnetic anomalies

32:07.960 --> 32:09.560
which were actually transitioning from

32:09.661 --> 32:11.391
one place to another. They were moving.

32:11.463 --> 32:13.463
Highly rare and extremely unusual.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.302
We weren't able to determine what was

32:15.400 --> 32:17.030
causing these anomalies.

32:18.837 --> 32:20.897
It's totally inexplicable.

32:21.006 --> 32:23.306
And of course, this has given rise

32:23.408 --> 32:26.008
to theories that perhaps

32:26.111 --> 32:27.881
there is something else here.

32:27.980 --> 32:30.250
Perhaps it's a UFO...

32:30.349 --> 32:33.119
some kind of alien base;
perhaps even the remnants

32:33.218 --> 32:35.318
of a lost civilization.

32:35.420 --> 32:37.820
And now the NSA themself

32:37.923 --> 32:40.193
have almost put a blanket

32:40.292 --> 32:41.832
over any further research,

32:41.927 --> 32:44.857
and it's almost become a no-go area.

32:46.198 --> 32:48.968
Vostok is not the only site

32:49.067 --> 32:51.367
with limited outside access.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.440
Seven different countries

32:53.539 --> 32:56.069
have claimed territories in Antarctica,

32:56.175 --> 32:59.305
yet it remains one of
the most restricted locations

32:59.411 --> 33:01.481
in the world.

33:01.547 --> 33:03.207
Currently, there are 68

33:03.315 --> 33:05.215
international bases here,

33:05.317 --> 33:07.247
many of which require permits

33:07.352 --> 33:09.592
or special permissions to visit.

33:09.688 --> 33:13.258
They are manned not just with scientists

33:13.358 --> 33:15.488
but also military personnel.

33:15.594 --> 33:18.904
But why is it so restricted?

33:21.200 --> 33:24.230
McMurdo Station, Antarctica.

33:24.336 --> 33:28.136
Located on a southern peninsula
of Ross Island,

33:28.240 --> 33:32.140
this is the largest research
station on the continent.

33:32.244 --> 33:35.284
It was opened by the U.S. government

33:35.380 --> 33:38.050
in 1956 and houses

33:38.150 --> 33:41.920
up to as many as 1,200
residents at a time.

33:43.388 --> 33:46.088
In January of 2015

33:46.191 --> 33:48.091
a U.S. Navy flight engineer,

33:48.193 --> 33:50.993
who served with the
Antarctic Development Squadron

33:51.063 --> 33:53.103
at McMurdo for 14 years,

33:53.165 --> 33:56.665
came forward to investigative
reporter Linda Moulton Howe

33:56.768 --> 34:00.198
with bizarre accounts
of his time in Antarctica.

34:00.305 --> 34:03.205
In January of 2015,

34:03.308 --> 34:06.338
I got an e-mail from a retired

34:06.445 --> 34:08.105
naval flight engineer.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.882
He's asked me to call him only Brian

34:10.983 --> 34:13.083
in the world public.

34:13.185 --> 34:15.685
And this is what he told me:

34:15.786 --> 34:19.357
From about 1983, to when he retired

34:19.458 --> 34:22.358
from the Navy in 1997,

34:22.460 --> 34:25.101
he was in all kinds

34:25.197 --> 34:28.967
of what they call Antarctic
squadron expedition missions,

34:29.067 --> 34:31.527
that included rescuing people

34:31.637 --> 34:33.597
in and out of various places.

34:33.705 --> 34:38.105
In all these trips, nothing of
a high strangeness had occurred.

34:38.210 --> 34:41.110
And then, all of a sudden,
it was one thing after another.

34:41.213 --> 34:45.023
During a squadron mission
in the Transantarctic Mountains,

34:45.117 --> 34:50.417
the whole crew saw a whole bunch
of silver darting objects.

34:50.522 --> 34:52.592
And they are round.

34:52.658 --> 34:54.987
And he says they're doing
the strangest thing.

34:55.092 --> 34:58.063
They're going, like,
to this peak in a group,

34:58.163 --> 35:01.103
to this peak in a group,
to this peak in a group.

35:01.166 --> 35:03.296
And then they'd all take off.

35:03.402 --> 35:08.042
And not only did this happen
once, it happened over and over.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.436
According to the informant,

35:10.542 --> 35:12.182
this was just one

35:12.277 --> 35:14.277
of many strange mysteries
on the continent

35:14.379 --> 35:17.109
that he witnessed during his time there.

35:17.215 --> 35:21.375
They get an assignment not long after.

35:21.486 --> 35:23.116
There's a medical emergency.

35:23.221 --> 35:26.261
They are now under the gun,
the clock is ticking,

35:26.358 --> 35:28.388
and a decision was made:

35:28.493 --> 35:30.663
They're going o...
through the no-fly zone

35:30.729 --> 35:32.459
because it's a medical emergency.

35:32.564 --> 35:34.634
And what do they see?

35:34.733 --> 35:37.273
In the ice,

35:37.369 --> 35:40.999
like, a huge entrance to a cave

35:41.106 --> 35:44.236
but slanted going down. And he said,

35:44.343 --> 35:47.043
"I think it was at least, Linda,
200 feet in diameter,

35:47.145 --> 35:48.805
a big hole in the ice."

35:48.914 --> 35:52.224
And he said, "Our instruments
are not operating.

35:52.317 --> 35:55.247
"We were losing electricity.
We had magnetic anomalies.

35:55.354 --> 35:58.824
"And we concluded there's
something about this hole

35:58.924 --> 36:02.064
that is now causing these problems."

36:02.160 --> 36:06.300
They do their medical recovery.

36:06.398 --> 36:08.598
And the next thing they know,

36:08.700 --> 36:10.570
they're all being chewed out

36:10.669 --> 36:13.069
by men in suits

36:13.171 --> 36:16.671
that are not from McMurdo.

36:16.775 --> 36:19.335
They appear to be from Washington, DC.

36:19.444 --> 36:20.844
And he-he said,

36:20.946 --> 36:23.746
"They told us that we are never, ever

36:23.849 --> 36:26.279
"to fly over that hole.

36:26.385 --> 36:28.485
And we are never to discuss it again."

36:28.587 --> 36:30.217
What is that about?

36:30.322 --> 36:32.292
And does that have anything to do

36:32.391 --> 36:35.031
with all these other pieces
that keep emerging

36:35.127 --> 36:38.357
that there might be
something archaeological

36:38.463 --> 36:40.263
in Antarctica?

36:41.867 --> 36:44.167
According to
ancient astronaut theorists,

36:44.269 --> 36:47.669
this was not the first time
a massive hole has been spotted

36:47.773 --> 36:50.673
in the ice of Antarctica.

36:50.776 --> 36:52.506
Famous polar explorer

36:52.611 --> 36:53.511
Admiral Richard Byrd

36:53.612 --> 36:55.382
allegedly reported

36:55.480 --> 36:58.450
seeing a massive entrance
to an underground world

36:58.550 --> 37:03.320
during his 1947 expedition
to the South Pole.

37:03.422 --> 37:07.222
Admiral Byrd made
a lot of unusual statements,

37:07.325 --> 37:11.725
allegedly talking about a large
opening at the South Pole,

37:11.830 --> 37:15.400
that went deep inside
the Earth, ice-free,

37:15.500 --> 37:17.670
and was inhabited

37:17.769 --> 37:22.039
by various sorts of aliens.

37:22.140 --> 37:24.510
And when Byrd got back
to the United States,

37:24.609 --> 37:26.609
he was brought back to Washington,

37:26.711 --> 37:30.251
where he was questioned very
heavily about his statements.

37:30.348 --> 37:35.148
And, allegedly, he was told
to stop talking about this.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.593
You have to wonder, is the South Pole

37:37.689 --> 37:41.589
some kind
of extraterrestrial entry zone,

37:41.660 --> 37:44.530
some kind of portal that's so important

37:44.629 --> 37:48.359
that it has to be controlled
by the military?

37:48.467 --> 37:52.067
Is the United States
government covering up

37:52.170 --> 37:55.770
an extraterrestrial presence
in Antarctica?

37:55.874 --> 38:00.214
And if so, could they be
the same otherworldly beings

38:00.312 --> 38:04.512
that once occupied the continent
thousands of years ago?

38:04.616 --> 38:06.816
Ancient astronaut theorists believe

38:06.918 --> 38:08.818
the truth may be revealed

38:08.920 --> 38:13.190
when Antarctica's ice
finally disappears.

38:17.804 --> 38:20.474
East Antarctica.

38:20.573 --> 38:24.313
October, 2015.

38:24.411 --> 38:26.641
Scientists at NASA announce

38:26.746 --> 38:29.946
that despite years
of thinking otherwise,

38:30.050 --> 38:32.680
they are now finding
that the ice in this region

38:32.752 --> 38:34.692
is actually growing,

38:34.788 --> 38:38.318
averaging 82 billion tons a year.

38:38.425 --> 38:42.525
Snowfall is currently adding ice
to most of the continent.

38:42.629 --> 38:46.929
But at the same time,
glaciers are rapidly melting

38:47.033 --> 38:50.773
along the coast of Western Antarctica.

38:50.870 --> 38:54.640
Scientists calculate that, since 2009,

38:54.741 --> 38:57.581
as much as 60 cubic kilometers of ice,

38:57.677 --> 39:01.477
the equivalent of
70,000 Empire State Buildings,

39:01.581 --> 39:05.151
is disappearing into the ocean
each year.

39:05.251 --> 39:07.521
But why is the ice here melting,

39:07.620 --> 39:09.590
when it is growing throughout much

39:09.689 --> 39:12.889
of the rest of the continent?

39:12.992 --> 39:17.232
We see the graphic
pictures on television

39:17.330 --> 39:21.970
of the ice caps melting
and falling into the sea.

39:22.035 --> 39:25.365
But it's actually only in some areas

39:25.438 --> 39:28.208
that the ice caps are actually melting.

39:28.308 --> 39:30.538
What's so strange is that,

39:30.643 --> 39:35.883
through various factors,
that the ice in Antarctica

39:35.982 --> 39:38.722
might actually be growing and extending.

39:38.818 --> 39:41.888
This is very strange.

39:41.988 --> 39:44.288
We can't rule out the possibility

39:44.390 --> 39:48.560
that, in certain cases,
there could be entire cities

39:48.661 --> 39:50.231
that are built underground

39:50.330 --> 39:52.300
that may even be actively maintained

39:52.398 --> 39:54.028
by extraterrestrials now,

39:54.134 --> 39:56.534
and that as those cities are powered up

39:56.636 --> 40:01.306
or expanded in size that they
are giving off some kind of heat

40:01.407 --> 40:05.807
and that heat, in turn,
is melting the ice above them.

40:05.912 --> 40:10.552
If there are things buried under
the miles of ice at Antarctica,

40:10.650 --> 40:12.780
then that would mean
that had to have happened

40:12.886 --> 40:14.746
before the last Ice Age.

40:14.854 --> 40:16.894
So who knows what we'll find there?

40:16.990 --> 40:19.390
Remnants of a lost civilization,

40:19.492 --> 40:23.762
perhaps even tools with which
these civilizations were built.

40:25.732 --> 40:29.572
It's possible that underneath
the ice will be keys for us

40:29.669 --> 40:32.539
to actually save ourselves

40:32.639 --> 40:35.639
and reclaim our ancient past.

40:35.742 --> 40:38.082
We may end up in a situation

40:38.178 --> 40:40.478
where this can't be covered up anymore,

40:40.580 --> 40:43.410
where visible ruins-- gigantic pyramids,

40:43.516 --> 40:44.976
gigantic obelisks--

40:45.084 --> 40:48.994
start to peek through the ice.

40:49.088 --> 40:51.088
And, at that point, it's game over.

40:51.191 --> 40:53.591
No longer can this be swept
under the rug.

40:53.693 --> 40:57.603
There's no question that
under the ice of Antarctica

40:57.697 --> 41:00.097
there could be extraterrestrial craft.

41:00.200 --> 41:02.470
There could be cities down there.

41:02.569 --> 41:04.399
Bottom line is,

41:04.504 --> 41:08.214
it will shock the entire
belief system of humankind.

41:08.308 --> 41:11.608
It will just change everything we know.

41:11.711 --> 41:14.781
What really lies beneath

41:14.881 --> 41:17.681
the ice and snow in Antarctica?

41:17.784 --> 41:23.024
Was this frozen continent once
covered with lush vegetation,

41:23.122 --> 41:27.862
as well as pyramids
that predate those in Egypt?

41:27.961 --> 41:32.531
And if extraterrestrials
truly did inhabit Antarctica,

41:32.632 --> 41:34.872
could these otherworldly visitors

41:34.968 --> 41:38.498
still be hiding out there today?

41:38.605 --> 41:41.135
Perhaps, one day soon,

41:41.241 --> 41:44.511
we will discover what the ice
of Antarctica

41:44.611 --> 41:47.141
has hidden for thousands of years,

41:47.247 --> 41:50.847
and it will finally expose the truth

41:50.984 --> 41:54.124
about our alien past.
