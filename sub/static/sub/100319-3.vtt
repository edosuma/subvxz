00:01.148 --> 00:02.359
People!

00:02.384 --> 00:05.023
The Sprq Point launch party
is in just three days.

00:05.048 --> 00:08.125
Have we gotten anywhere
on Charlie's watch demo?

00:08.150 --> 00:10.129
Well, considering you came up
with a completely new version

00:10.153 --> 00:12.531
two hours ago and the technology
doesn't even exist yet,

00:12.556 --> 00:15.223
I guess you could say...
we're working on it.

00:15.248 --> 00:18.068
Oh. Well, we've got one chance

00:18.093 --> 00:20.375
to leverage my husband's star power.

00:20.400 --> 00:24.312
The last thing he endorsed was
a little company called Uber.

00:24.337 --> 00:25.637
Have you ever heard of that?

00:25.662 --> 00:28.570
So could everyone please
act as if they care?

00:28.595 --> 00:31.367
I haven't breathed outside
air in over 48 hours.

00:31.392 --> 00:33.039
Because air is for winners.

00:33.064 --> 00:35.364
How hard can it be to
mirror Charlie's watch

00:35.389 --> 00:37.765
to everyone else's at the
party with limited latency?

00:37.790 --> 00:42.443
Look, I'm gonna go easy on you,
let you knock off early, okay?

00:42.468 --> 00:44.551
We'll get a fresh start in the morning.

00:45.683 --> 00:48.031
She does realize it's midnight, right?

00:48.056 --> 00:50.031
I know Charlie Bennett
is a big get and all,

00:50.056 --> 00:52.429
but why are we killing
ourselves for this chump?

00:52.454 --> 00:53.882
What did you just say, bro?

00:53.907 --> 00:56.937
Are you calling the CEO
of RockOut Games a chump?

00:56.962 --> 00:58.086
Hey, Tobes, Tobes, Tobes, take it easy.

00:58.110 --> 00:59.321
- No, no, no.
- No, take it easy, all right?

00:59.345 --> 01:02.234
Not everybody
understands Charlie's genius.

01:02.426 --> 01:04.159
Plus, like, what if he fights back?

01:04.184 --> 01:05.437
Yeah.

01:07.009 --> 01:09.240
Dude, Joan is crushing us.

01:09.265 --> 01:11.101
When I get home,
I'm going straight to bed.

01:11.126 --> 01:13.414
Honestly, there's a world
in which I don't even floss.

01:13.439 --> 01:14.789
Are you forgetting?

01:14.930 --> 01:16.327
We told Simon we'd meet up with him

01:16.351 --> 01:18.281
so he can approve Mo
to DJ the watch party.

01:18.306 --> 01:20.484
Oh, that's right.
And I invited Autumn, too.

01:20.509 --> 01:23.804
Why did we come up with
this stupid, stupid plan?

01:23.829 --> 01:25.171
We're not that bright.

01:25.516 --> 01:28.178
Splash some water on your face,
and meet me by the elevators.

01:28.203 --> 01:29.437

03:05.589 --> 03:08.592
Hi. I'm here.
We literally just got off work,

03:08.617 --> 03:09.663
which would have been bad enough,

03:09.687 --> 03:11.331
but then my boss had
to go and sing to me.

03:11.356 --> 03:13.711
Ooh, was it "9 to 5"? Because
Dolly Parton is my spirit animal.

03:13.735 --> 03:16.180
It was actually "Satisfaction,"
which makes no sense,

03:16.205 --> 03:18.094
because we've been
working nonstop recently.

03:18.119 --> 03:20.031
How could Joan
possibly not be satisfied?

03:20.056 --> 03:22.578
Maybe she was singing about
something besides work.

03:22.603 --> 03:25.555
There are lots of reasons why
people are unsatisfied, Zoey.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.164
80% of it is sex-related.

03:27.189 --> 03:29.055
Do you just make these statistics up?

03:29.080 --> 03:30.381
35% of the time.

03:30.406 --> 03:32.844
Well, if this has anything to do
with Joan's love life,

03:32.869 --> 03:34.422
then I am out.

03:34.456 --> 03:35.649
No good can come out of me

03:35.674 --> 03:38.337
being my boss's relationship counselor.

03:38.362 --> 03:39.469
You know what?

03:39.494 --> 03:41.711
I'm gonna keep this
one simple. I'll go in.

03:41.736 --> 03:43.702
I'll ask Joan if anything's
bothering her at work,

03:43.727 --> 03:44.923
because that is my responsibility,

03:44.947 --> 03:46.446
but beyond that, I am drawing a line.

03:46.471 --> 03:49.306
Zoey, look, I say this
with enough love and respect

03:49.331 --> 03:51.598
that our three-week friendship demands.

03:51.623 --> 03:54.117
I'm auditioning to DJ your party,

03:54.142 --> 03:55.852
and you're distracting as hell.

03:55.877 --> 03:58.969
So if you'll excuse me,
I have to hit 'em with the...

04:03.202 --> 04:06.117
♪ Oh, oh, do me, baby ♪

04:09.094 --> 04:10.665
- ♪ Alright, stop what you're doing... ♪
- Hey, hey, Zoey!

04:10.689 --> 04:11.901
Check this out.

04:12.422 --> 04:15.930
Autumn can guess anyone's drink
within minutes of meeting them.

04:15.955 --> 04:17.047
Simon's tough, though,

04:17.072 --> 04:20.110
because you've got this chill,
confident vibe.

04:20.135 --> 04:21.735
But then it's like...

04:21.760 --> 04:23.360
"What's that guy's deal?" you know?

04:23.385 --> 04:25.523
- Yeah.
- I've got it.

04:25.548 --> 04:26.828
- Mezcal Mule.
- Whoa!

04:26.853 --> 04:28.360
You actually nailed it.

04:28.385 --> 04:30.203
Are you serious? I told you.

04:30.228 --> 04:33.047
Listen, some people
can read your inner aura.

04:33.072 --> 04:34.789
- I can read your inner cocktail.
- Yeah.

04:34.814 --> 04:38.438
Come on, whiskey sour,
this body has gotta move.

04:38.463 --> 04:39.625
Oh! Sorry, guys.

04:39.650 --> 04:41.508
Her body is very bossy apparently.

04:42.163 --> 04:43.242
Okay.

04:43.267 --> 04:44.431
So your boy Mo's gonna be great

04:44.455 --> 04:47.070
for the Sprq Point party.
He is a boy, right?

04:47.095 --> 04:48.641
He doesn't believe in labels.

04:48.666 --> 04:50.352
Well, I'm labeling him the perfect DJ

04:50.377 --> 04:52.343
for our big night,
and I'm not just saying that

04:52.368 --> 04:54.768
because it's in three days
and the first DJ backed out.

04:55.229 --> 04:56.423
Hey, if you want to get out there,

04:56.447 --> 04:57.782
please don't let me hold you back.

04:57.806 --> 04:59.961
No, no, I'm good. Seriously.

04:59.986 --> 05:02.593
The only place I'm comfortable
dancing is in my bedroom...

05:02.618 --> 05:03.836
... closet.

05:06.743 --> 05:08.543
Well, normally
I'd be the first out there,

05:08.568 --> 05:10.922
but I haven't been
feeling it since my dad...

05:12.133 --> 05:15.429
It's just like it's too
soon to let go or something.

05:15.465 --> 05:18.594
I... totally get it.

05:19.050 --> 05:21.551
If I walk into my parents'
house in a good mood,

05:21.576 --> 05:23.709
I feel like I'm betraying my father.

05:25.785 --> 05:27.227
Are we crazy?

05:27.252 --> 05:28.414
Yes.

05:30.458 --> 05:31.906
Ooh.

05:34.547 --> 05:37.172
Is it okay for him to be
air spanking her like that?

05:37.197 --> 05:40.156
I think it's all right. Those look
like consensual spanks to me.

05:42.360 --> 05:44.211
Emily, Zoey's ready.

05:44.236 --> 05:46.671
Sorry. I was just looking
for some Pop-Tarts,

05:46.696 --> 05:48.773
but then I realized that
you're not stoned college kids

05:48.797 --> 05:50.884
so I'm just gonna take down
this loaf of bread instead.

05:50.908 --> 05:52.336
So now that we're all here,

05:52.372 --> 05:53.642
the buzzer was a great first step.

05:53.666 --> 05:55.672
- Thank you very much.
- But as we all learned,

05:55.697 --> 05:58.633
it's frustrating communicating with
only yes or no answers, right, Dad?

06:00.111 --> 06:01.281
Right there with you, honey.

06:01.306 --> 06:02.758
So I created a program

06:02.783 --> 06:07.008
that will help Dad spell
what he wants to say

06:07.033 --> 06:09.195
by using a mouse to
select different letters.

06:09.415 --> 06:11.742
So, Dad, now's your chance

06:11.767 --> 06:14.203
to finally say what's been on your mind.

06:14.342 --> 06:15.841
Let 'er rip.

06:18.587 --> 06:19.985
Ooh.

06:20.448 --> 06:22.110
L-E...

06:22.709 --> 06:25.063
Do you think he's gonna say,
"Lean in closer?"

06:25.088 --> 06:26.797
Maybe he can't hear us right now.

06:26.822 --> 06:28.414
I hope it's not "Leave me alone."

06:28.439 --> 06:30.422
Or "Leaping lizards."

06:30.447 --> 06:31.969
Why would he say that?

06:41.186 --> 06:43.149
"Lemonade"?

06:44.849 --> 06:46.680
That's what you want
to say to all of us?

06:48.361 --> 06:51.141
Guess he's just been craving
lemonade all this time.

06:51.166 --> 06:54.828
Well, one lemonade coming up.

06:57.045 --> 06:58.445
Mom.

06:59.710 --> 07:00.711
Are you all right?

07:00.736 --> 07:02.945
Oh... Yeah, no, I'm fine.

07:03.213 --> 07:07.539
Um, it was silly of me to think

07:07.564 --> 07:09.383
that the very first
thing that he would spell

07:09.408 --> 07:13.143
would be some deep
and meaningful message.

07:13.168 --> 07:15.569
I just got my hopes up too much.

07:16.575 --> 07:18.695
Uh, shouldn't you be getting to work?

07:18.720 --> 07:20.641
Don't remind me. I've got to find out

07:20.666 --> 07:22.999
why Joan is so unhappy with my team.

07:23.329 --> 07:25.629
Hopefully she's in a better place today.

07:29.353 --> 07:31.672
We're out of Crunch Berries again?

07:32.223 --> 07:34.344
Who ate all the Crunch Berries?!

07:34.369 --> 07:36.102
Was it Glenn? Bring me Glenn!

07:36.127 --> 07:38.469
Dude, come on, man.
I have to be lead programmer

07:38.494 --> 07:39.977
on the watch demo. I worship Charlie.

07:40.002 --> 07:41.568
I'm pretty sure I worship him more,

07:41.593 --> 07:44.127
'cause I went to his TED Talk,
memorized his TED Talk,

07:44.152 --> 07:45.735
and then gave his TED Talk

07:45.760 --> 07:47.719
to a workshop about giving TED Talks.

07:47.744 --> 07:50.178
Guys, it doesn't matter
who the lead programmer is.

07:50.203 --> 07:52.149
Just, please,
stop fanboying over Charlie,

07:52.174 --> 07:53.477
and get the work done.

07:53.502 --> 07:56.573
You just don't get it because
you've never played "Better World."

07:56.598 --> 07:59.151
It was the first virtual society RPG,

07:59.176 --> 08:00.776
and dedicated players like us

08:00.801 --> 08:03.479
finally had an entire
universe to explore.

08:03.504 --> 08:05.425
Without ever leaving
your parents' basement.

08:05.450 --> 08:06.831
Make your little jokes, brah,

08:06.856 --> 08:08.940
but you could do
anything in "Better World."

08:08.965 --> 08:11.120
Lost my virginity in there.
Still counts.

08:11.145 --> 08:14.034
Does it, though? Does it?

08:14.584 --> 08:16.698
Zoey, finally.

08:16.723 --> 08:19.261
We need to decide who
the lead programmer is.

08:19.286 --> 08:21.301
- Leif and Tobin have been acting...
- They can be co-leads.

08:21.325 --> 08:23.192
I have bigger issues
to deal with right now.

08:23.217 --> 08:24.471
Hi, Joan.

08:24.496 --> 08:26.690
Top of the morning to you.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.323
- Don't ever say that again.
- Okay.

08:28.348 --> 08:30.596
Uh, well, I just wanted
to do a quick check-in,

08:30.621 --> 08:32.222
make sure you're happy
with our performance.

08:32.246 --> 08:35.746
You seem just a little bit
more frustrated than normal.

08:35.772 --> 08:39.003
So I was wondering if you felt that,

08:39.028 --> 08:41.028
from us, you were getting...

08:42.052 --> 08:44.932
no satisfaction.

08:45.576 --> 08:48.953
Um, first of all,
that's terrible grammar.

08:48.978 --> 08:51.212
And don't tell the clowns downstairs.

08:51.237 --> 08:53.524
I think you're doing a pretty good job.

08:53.902 --> 08:55.468
Are you sure?

08:56.034 --> 08:57.690
But just so you know,

08:57.948 --> 09:00.526
if you were feeling
dissatisfied in any way,

09:01.221 --> 09:02.542
you could tell me.

09:02.567 --> 09:04.448
Oh, thank you for giving me permission

09:04.473 --> 09:07.307
to do what is literally
in my job description.

09:07.589 --> 09:10.784
I guess that perhaps I
have been a little more...

09:10.809 --> 09:12.675
on edge than normal.

09:12.700 --> 09:13.732
Understandable.

09:13.757 --> 09:15.991
We got a big event coming up.

09:16.016 --> 09:17.964
Hah! Yes, it's the event.

09:17.989 --> 09:19.788
Oh, is it not the event?

09:19.813 --> 09:21.800
Oh, you know, the event,

09:21.825 --> 09:24.459
the watch, the keynote speaker.

09:24.588 --> 09:26.323
You mean your husband Charlie?

09:26.995 --> 09:27.995
Oh.

09:28.020 --> 09:31.612
Um, I thought that was a
good thing he was coming. Isn't it?

09:31.637 --> 09:33.261
Oh, yeah. As a woman in my position,

09:33.286 --> 09:34.849
it feels super great

09:34.880 --> 09:36.771
that I need
my husband's stamp of approval

09:36.796 --> 09:38.763
for me to get a big win at work.

09:38.788 --> 09:40.834
Right. That sounds...

09:41.285 --> 09:42.951
complicated, but, uh,

09:42.976 --> 09:44.795
since your issue seems to be personal,

09:44.820 --> 09:47.560
not work-related,
I'm guessing we're good.

09:47.585 --> 09:50.353
Honestly, you get to
a point in a long marriage

09:50.378 --> 09:52.759
where you look at the
naked man beside you...

09:52.784 --> 09:54.946
Whoop, gotta go.
So much work to do. Ta-ta.

09:55.369 --> 09:56.821
Off the table.

10:12.229 --> 10:13.962
Again?

10:23.888 --> 10:25.509
Hello, Mother.

10:53.243 --> 10:54.539
I'm happy to grab lunch,

10:54.564 --> 10:56.798
but I don't think I'll be much help

10:56.823 --> 10:58.532
with the playlist for the watch party.

10:58.557 --> 11:01.423
That was a ruse. You know
you are literally the last person

11:01.448 --> 11:03.115
I would ask for song suggestions from.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.687
- Right.
- What we need

11:04.712 --> 11:06.023
to be talking about is me meeting

11:06.047 --> 11:07.747
both of the men in your life last night.

11:07.772 --> 11:10.876
Mo, Max and Simon are not the,
quote, men in my life,

11:10.901 --> 11:13.325
end quote. One of them
is about to get married

11:13.350 --> 11:15.548
to a lovely Brit named Jessica,

11:15.573 --> 11:18.813
and the other is in a
very handsy relationship.

11:18.838 --> 11:21.165
Sounds like somebody's a little
jealous of Max and Autumn.

11:21.190 --> 11:24.243
Not jealous. Just aware.

11:24.907 --> 11:27.064
Which I acknowledge is weird,
'cause I'm the one who set them up.

11:27.088 --> 11:30.517
I get it. I wasn't into
Cory Booker until Rosario Dawson.

11:30.542 --> 11:34.112
Then, I was like, "Okay,
Cory, I see you."

11:34.290 --> 11:36.435
At first, I was Team Simon,
because, you know,

11:36.460 --> 11:39.394
he has that whole brooding,
emotionally raw vibe.

11:39.419 --> 11:41.586
But then I was Team Max,
because he's got

11:41.611 --> 11:44.890
that sweet, funny,
guy-next-door thing going for him.

11:44.915 --> 11:47.715
Mo, I am serious.
This debate is not happening.

11:47.740 --> 11:50.251
- There are no teams.
- And yet I play for both.

12:02.069 --> 12:03.702
What do you hear them playing?

12:03.727 --> 12:05.835
A ratchet version of
"Yankee Doodle Dandy."

12:05.860 --> 12:07.079
I was a drum major in high school,

12:07.103 --> 12:08.748
and that mess would
not have been tolerated.

12:08.772 --> 12:10.642
Well, I hear
them playing "Satisfaction,"

12:10.667 --> 12:15.654
and that song has been
following me everywhere I go.

12:15.679 --> 12:17.245
It's like it's haunting me.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.626
Well, did you talk to your boss

12:18.651 --> 12:19.983
like you said you were going to?

12:20.008 --> 12:21.353
I mean, I sort of did,

12:21.378 --> 12:24.960
until I found out that what
she's so unsatisfied with

12:24.985 --> 12:26.227
has something to do with her love life,

12:26.251 --> 12:27.266
and then I just ran the other direction.

12:27.290 --> 12:29.454
We're learning something
new about your power, then.

12:29.479 --> 12:31.512
Just because you don't
want to help somebody

12:31.537 --> 12:34.104
does not mean the universe
is gonna say, "Thank you. Next."

12:34.129 --> 12:36.493
But since when is it my responsibility

12:36.518 --> 12:40.020
to be a couples therapist?
I am terrible at relationships.

12:40.045 --> 12:41.947
Look, Zo-loft, do what you want,

12:41.972 --> 12:44.532
but if you don't dive into
your boss's man troubles,

12:44.557 --> 12:46.068
then you might be haunted
by The Rolling Stones

12:46.092 --> 12:47.725
for all of eternity.

12:50.242 --> 12:51.524
Okay!

12:52.545 --> 12:54.245
I'll do it!

13:00.712 --> 13:01.990
Ahoy there, Joan.

13:02.751 --> 13:04.359
What's wrong now?
Is this about mirroring

13:04.394 --> 13:07.040
- the watches for Charlie's demo?
- Oh, actually, no. I just...

13:07.065 --> 13:08.377
Because nothing tanks a presentation

13:08.401 --> 13:10.775
- like a sync-delay.
- Totally agree. No.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.633
What I'd really like
is for all the watches

13:12.669 --> 13:14.346
to flash different
colors at the same time.

13:14.370 --> 13:16.203
What is wrong with you and Charlie?

13:18.022 --> 13:19.110
Just...

13:19.135 --> 13:21.119
- Um, why? What?
- I don't know.

13:21.144 --> 13:22.822
I don't know. It seems like
you two are having problems.

13:22.846 --> 13:24.135
Am I wrong? I'm happy to be wrong.

13:24.159 --> 13:25.690
We have the same old drama.

13:25.715 --> 13:27.063
There's nothing to worry about.

13:27.088 --> 13:29.032
But I feel like I maybe...

13:29.523 --> 13:31.290
need to worry about it.

13:31.513 --> 13:35.384
And I know I'm just a colleague...

13:35.409 --> 13:37.442
- Subordinate.
- But I have always found it

13:37.467 --> 13:40.931
helpful to vent when I'm
feeling dissatisfied.

13:40.956 --> 13:43.423
I don't vent. I scream into a pillow.

13:46.601 --> 13:48.142
Do you want a drink?

13:49.663 --> 13:52.938
Right now in the middle of the workday?

13:53.795 --> 13:55.438
Mm, here we go.

13:56.691 --> 13:58.704
72-year-old scotch.

13:59.009 --> 14:00.196
It'll be lost on you,

14:00.221 --> 14:02.149
but one day, you'll appreciate it.

14:03.897 --> 14:06.626
So you want to hear about my marriage.

14:07.253 --> 14:09.087
Sorry I missed dinner,

14:09.112 --> 14:12.981
but Joan would not stop
talking about her love life.

14:13.006 --> 14:14.868
She made me day drink, Mom.

14:14.893 --> 14:18.043
Well, doesn't she have any
other female friends at work?

14:18.068 --> 14:20.168
There are no other females at work.

14:21.091 --> 14:23.079
It's sad, Mom.

14:23.174 --> 14:25.063
Joan and Charlie are, like,

14:25.890 --> 14:28.892
the exact opposite of you and Dad.

14:29.157 --> 14:32.168
With them, everything
is always on his terms, and...

14:32.746 --> 14:34.691
she can't seem to
tell him what she needs.

14:34.716 --> 14:37.683
Well, your father had no trouble

14:37.708 --> 14:39.564
telling me his needs today.

14:39.589 --> 14:42.019
After many requests for lemonade,

14:42.044 --> 14:44.957
he managed to put a few words together.

14:44.982 --> 14:47.521
He's especially proud of spelling

14:47.546 --> 14:50.065
"No more 'Real Housewives.'"

14:51.791 --> 14:53.124
Is someone coming over?

14:54.019 --> 14:55.355
I don't think so.

14:55.380 --> 14:57.480
Honestly, I can't keep track anymore.

15:00.060 --> 15:01.159
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:01.184 --> 15:03.082
- Hey.
- I know it's late,

15:03.107 --> 15:04.972
but you said pop by anytime.

15:04.997 --> 15:06.791
I sure did.

15:06.816 --> 15:08.660
Rick and I just got
back from Santa Cruz,

15:08.685 --> 15:10.785
and we found this cute
little saltwater taffy shop,

15:10.810 --> 15:12.664
and we thought Mitch would love some.

15:12.689 --> 15:15.339
That is so sweet of you,
Susan. Thank you.

15:15.364 --> 15:17.964
Of course my dad can barely
swallow and might choke on it,

15:17.989 --> 15:21.144
but maybe I can try one
and describe it to him?

15:21.169 --> 15:23.183
- She day drank.
- I did.

15:23.208 --> 15:25.944
I think I should go make a
really nice cheese plate,

15:25.969 --> 15:28.102
and we should all sit down
and just have a catch-up.

15:28.138 --> 15:30.378
- Oh, we don't want to bother.
- I could eat.

15:31.173 --> 15:32.972
Okay. Go say hi to Mitch.

15:32.997 --> 15:34.463
I'll be right there.

15:35.885 --> 15:39.589
- Hi, Mitch. How are you?
- Hey, Mitch.

15:39.614 --> 15:41.230
Want some help?

15:41.255 --> 15:44.128
No. You go on home.
You've had a long day.

15:44.153 --> 15:45.497
I've got this.

15:45.522 --> 15:46.988
You sure? I don't mind.

Fresh bagels on a Thursday morning?

17:49.957 --> 17:51.862
What did we ever do to deserve this?

17:51.887 --> 17:52.902
All your wife talks about

17:52.927 --> 17:54.804
are her cravings for
various bread products.

17:54.829 --> 17:56.856
Don't blame me. Blame the tapeworm.

17:56.881 --> 17:59.418
- Eh...
- Oh, sorry, the cute tapeworm.

18:01.057 --> 18:03.425
Uh, actually, the reason I'm here

18:03.450 --> 18:05.700
is I want to talk about Mom.
She might not be handling things

18:05.724 --> 18:07.426
- as well as we think she is.
- Really? What...

18:07.450 --> 18:08.883
This is based on...

18:09.905 --> 18:11.472
A hunch.

18:11.497 --> 18:13.707
- A hunch?
- Mm-hmm.

18:13.732 --> 18:15.652
Well, as a public defender,

18:15.677 --> 18:18.144
you know how many innocent lives
I've seen ruined by a hunch?

18:18.169 --> 18:21.358
No, but I do know how
often you like to remind me

18:21.383 --> 18:22.777
that you are a public defender.

18:22.802 --> 18:25.002
Hey, listen, I'm a hero.

18:25.349 --> 18:26.973
I've been by their house
every day this week.

18:26.997 --> 18:29.418
- She's totally fine.
- Fine? She's not fine.

18:29.443 --> 18:32.177
I think someone should keep
an eye on her, and the problem

18:32.202 --> 18:34.404
is I am super swamped
with this big work event,

18:34.429 --> 18:36.886
and my boss is being
extra needy right now.

18:36.911 --> 18:39.128
Oh, so the bagels were a bribe, huh?

18:39.476 --> 18:42.212
Yeah? Those are dirty bagels.

18:42.237 --> 18:44.863
It's fine. It's fine.
I'll handle it just as soon

18:44.888 --> 18:48.324
as I can find my case
schedule for today. Ah.

18:48.349 --> 18:51.019
No, this is just a list
of lactation consultants.

18:59.055 --> 19:01.064
Hey, there you are.

19:01.089 --> 19:02.886
I don't know what you
did to Joan yesterday,

19:02.911 --> 19:04.918
but she's a totally different person.

19:04.943 --> 19:06.636
She actually yelled at me by name

19:06.661 --> 19:08.192
when she told me to
move in the stairwell.

19:08.216 --> 19:09.496
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:09.521 --> 19:12.261
Well, I'm glad something good
came out of talking to her.

19:12.286 --> 19:13.722
Hey, Zoey.

19:14.652 --> 19:15.762
Hey.

19:15.787 --> 19:17.199
What's happening?

19:17.224 --> 19:18.362
I don't know.

19:18.387 --> 19:20.220
- Can we talk?
- Oh.

19:22.911 --> 19:25.441
I'm gonna take you with me

19:25.466 --> 19:28.316
to a women-in-tech thing next month.

19:28.341 --> 19:32.339
It's in Daytona, a place that's
basically an STD with palm trees,

19:32.364 --> 19:35.496
but, um, I think...
I think we'll have fun.

19:35.799 --> 19:37.833
- Thank you?
- No, thank you.

19:37.904 --> 19:39.818
Thank you for our talk last night.

19:39.843 --> 19:41.842
It helped me see some
of the inefficiencies

19:41.867 --> 19:45.396
in my relationship,
and I have a solid game plan now

19:45.421 --> 19:49.880
moving forward to ensure
proper marital growth.

19:49.905 --> 19:51.591
I'm so happy I could be helpful.

19:51.616 --> 19:54.240
- I'm gonna...
- Oh, I-I got this for you.

19:54.854 --> 19:57.005
It's nothing, really, but...

19:58.621 --> 20:00.794
Oh, you could take the whole bag. Okay.

20:02.733 --> 20:04.500
They're Louboutins.

20:04.796 --> 20:06.663
- Wow.
- I know.

20:07.029 --> 20:09.199
I don't know who or what that is.

20:10.827 --> 20:13.365
They're, um, very nice shoes.

20:13.390 --> 20:15.444
Plus, you really need to step up
your game for the party.

20:15.468 --> 20:18.365
I mean, you dress like
a docent at a folk art museum.

20:18.448 --> 20:19.943
Oh, there's lunch.

20:19.968 --> 20:21.552
Must mean Charlie's on his way.

20:21.577 --> 20:23.056
He promised he'd stop by during lunch

20:23.080 --> 20:24.544
to go over the demo.

I, uh, thought
you worked on the top floor.

21:28.463 --> 21:29.492
No.

21:29.517 --> 21:31.216
Mr. Bennett, it is an honor to meet you.

21:31.241 --> 21:32.727
- Hi. Yeah.
- We're such big fans.

21:32.752 --> 21:35.984
Hi. Also the co-leads on the project.
Quick question.

21:36.009 --> 21:37.655
If you lose your virginity in
"Better World"...

21:37.679 --> 21:39.545
- Doesn't count.
- Okay. Yeah.

21:39.821 --> 21:41.720
- Told you.
- Yeah.

21:43.088 --> 21:46.055
All right. Should we work?

21:46.080 --> 21:48.246
Yes. Uh, conference room right that way.

21:49.841 --> 21:52.063
Um, oh, Zoey, join us, please,

21:52.088 --> 21:53.742
in case we have
questions about the demo.

21:53.767 --> 21:55.125
There's plenty of food.

21:55.150 --> 21:58.551
For Charlie, we order
all the sushi in San Francisco.

21:59.855 --> 22:02.215
Charlie, the reason we're so
excited is Zoey and her team

22:02.240 --> 22:04.152
were finally able to reprogram the demo

22:04.177 --> 22:08.084
so that this watch will mirror
to all the devices in the room,

22:08.109 --> 22:09.505
which is pretty fantastic...

22:09.529 --> 22:11.793
and, then, Hardware
came up with the prototype.

22:11.818 --> 22:13.255
Look at that.

22:13.279 --> 22:15.777
Babe? Charlie. Did you hear me?

22:15.802 --> 22:17.761
Uh, sorry. Rick thinks it's funny

22:17.786 --> 22:20.119
to scare me with foreign sales figures.

22:20.155 --> 22:21.955
Oh, nice watch.

22:21.981 --> 22:24.915
Thank you. Oh, Zoey,
come sit here with us.

22:24.960 --> 22:27.126
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, come sit on this end.

22:27.151 --> 22:28.283
Okay.

22:28.308 --> 22:29.886
Marketing put together a speech.

22:29.911 --> 22:32.478
It just has some bullet
points you might find useful.

22:32.503 --> 22:34.049
Anything you want to pick
to feature the watch,

22:34.073 --> 22:35.410
something about gaming.

22:35.435 --> 22:37.386
"You have the world of
gaming on your wrist."

22:38.816 --> 22:40.417
Charlie, we did this working lunch

22:40.442 --> 22:42.106
so that you could make
it to your next meeting.

22:42.130 --> 22:43.629
Could you just give me a minute?

22:43.971 --> 22:47.420
Sorry I can't skip school
for the entire day, Joan,

22:47.445 --> 22:50.279
but we both have major
releases coming up, right?

22:50.304 --> 22:51.577
I guess yours is more important.

22:51.601 --> 22:52.943
You're making that clear.

22:52.968 --> 22:54.209
And we're doing is again.

22:54.234 --> 22:56.301
Why do you have to
always turn everything

22:56.326 --> 22:58.459
- into an attack?
- This isn't an attack?

22:58.484 --> 23:00.981
No, this isn't an attack.
This is just me saying I need

23:01.006 --> 23:04.436
some space, too, for my work.
My work is important, too.

23:04.461 --> 23:06.676
But, Zoey,

23:06.701 --> 23:08.647
what is the thing we were
talking about last night?

23:08.671 --> 23:11.842
I was trying to explain
how I say one simple thing

23:11.867 --> 23:13.857
and... and it turns into an attack.

23:13.882 --> 23:14.904
- Me?
- Yes.

23:14.929 --> 23:17.521
Zoey put it in very clear terms.

23:18.077 --> 23:21.412
Did she, now? So, what was it exactly?

23:21.437 --> 23:24.874
I'd, um... I don't really
want to get involved.

23:24.899 --> 23:26.945
Oh, sounds like
it's a little late for that.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.843
- Hey.
- No, no, no, no. Please.

23:28.868 --> 23:33.676
Zoey, uh, tell me about
my dynamic with my wife.

23:33.821 --> 23:40.012
Um, I'm not exactly super
comfortable chiming in.

23:41.379 --> 23:42.707
But...

23:43.665 --> 23:45.590
for example...

23:46.286 --> 23:49.067
I don't know. Do you remember
the time when you and Joan

23:49.092 --> 23:51.254
were stuck in a gondola
in Aspen on New Year's Eve

23:51.279 --> 23:52.364
- and Joan was feeling...
- All right, all right.

23:52.388 --> 23:54.926
- Okay, whoa. We're done here.
- What do you mean?

23:54.951 --> 23:57.332
I'm not sure why you feel compelled

23:57.357 --> 23:59.411
to inject yourself into our marriage...

23:59.436 --> 24:01.629
- Charlie.
- But if you think it's helping...

24:02.946 --> 24:04.137
- ... you're wrong.
- Charlie!

24:04.162 --> 24:07.504
And, Joan,
you can have all the space you want.

24:07.529 --> 24:08.973
I'm gonna take a suite at the Fairmont.

24:08.997 --> 24:10.255
You don't have to worry about me coming

24:10.279 --> 24:12.551
to your little office party.

24:16.978 --> 24:20.583
Joan, I'm so sorry.

24:20.785 --> 24:23.856
I'm sorry.
That's very embarrassing. Um...

24:26.724 --> 24:30.168
Uh, just, you know, um,
I'll hold down the fort here,

24:30.193 --> 24:31.871
and don't even think about the party.

24:31.896 --> 24:33.863
Oh, God, the party.

24:34.410 --> 24:37.056
Please don't worry about anything.

24:38.204 --> 24:40.038
'Cause I'll fix it.

24:41.727 --> 24:43.625
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah...

24:44.936 --> 24:47.077
I didn't even know they made colors...

24:47.102 --> 24:48.694
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

24:48.719 --> 24:51.344
So, quick update. Charlie thought
the watch looked great,

24:51.369 --> 24:53.827
and he was very impressed
with all of our work here,

24:53.852 --> 24:56.352
so much so that he thought
the watch could launch itself,

24:56.377 --> 24:58.601
- and he dropped out of the event.
- What did you do?

24:58.626 --> 25:00.595
Hey, also, what's the deal
with the sushi back there?

25:00.619 --> 25:02.439
Is it first come, first serve,
or am I allowed to...

25:02.463 --> 25:03.689
- Zoey.
- I don't want to get into it

25:03.713 --> 25:06.409
right now. He just can't be here.

25:06.632 --> 25:08.144
Who can't be here?

25:08.169 --> 25:09.883
Because if we have a cancellation,

25:09.908 --> 25:11.695
there's a massive wait list

25:11.720 --> 25:13.150
now that Charlie's demoing the watch.

25:13.174 --> 25:14.828
There has been a small hiccup.

25:14.853 --> 25:19.322
Um, is there any possible
chance you could replace Charlie

25:19.347 --> 25:22.114
with another huge media
influencer by tomorrow night?

25:25.693 --> 25:28.060
♪ My name is no, my sign is no ♪

25:28.085 --> 25:30.828
♪ My number is no,
you need to let it go ♪

25:30.853 --> 25:33.220
♪ You need to let it go,

25:33.245 --> 25:35.539

25:35.564 --> 25:37.962

25:37.986 --> 25:40.787

25:43.111 --> 25:46.547

25:46.572 --> 25:49.607
Um, yeah.

25:50.386 --> 25:51.919
It shouldn't be a problem.

25:51.944 --> 25:54.555
Just pull out my contacts
and start working on that.

25:54.580 --> 25:57.415
Cool, cool. Our team can help, too.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.006
Thank you.

26:00.395 --> 26:03.262
Seriously, David, I'm fine.

26:03.287 --> 26:07.336
You did not have to leave work
to take me on a lemonade run.

26:07.361 --> 26:09.360
I know, but you've got
a lot on your plate,

26:09.385 --> 26:11.383
even if it is easier to
communicate with Dad now.

26:11.408 --> 26:13.211
Oh, is it easier?

26:15.798 --> 26:18.422
Oh, perfect.

26:18.447 --> 26:20.246
Amazing, actually.

26:20.271 --> 26:22.188
It's fine. Mom,
we can find more lemonade.

26:22.213 --> 26:24.188
Chalk that up as another fail for me.

26:24.213 --> 26:27.195
What are you talking about?
You're not... You're not failing.

26:27.775 --> 26:32.995
I just feel like I am spinning
a million plates at once,

26:33.020 --> 26:34.891
and the first thing that your father

26:34.916 --> 26:36.891
wanted to tell me on that computer

26:36.916 --> 26:40.031
was about something I was
not providing for him.

26:40.056 --> 26:41.836
Dad's not always fully there.

26:41.861 --> 26:43.743
We don't actually know
what's going on in his head.

26:43.767 --> 26:47.289
I know, but I thought he might
say something sweet or tender.

26:47.314 --> 26:50.891
Instead, he requested a beverage.

26:51.387 --> 26:53.554
And now I can't even give him that.

26:56.266 --> 26:58.164
There's a Trader Joe's
three blocks from here.

26:58.189 --> 26:59.611
I'm sure they'll have
plenty of lemonade.

26:59.635 --> 27:02.503
But your father likes
the one from here more.

27:06.725 --> 27:08.648
Hi, there.

27:09.392 --> 27:10.725
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:10.750 --> 27:13.518
Um, could you spare a couple of bottles,

27:13.543 --> 27:15.164
because I think that you guys

27:15.189 --> 27:16.889
might have cleaned out the whole store?

27:16.914 --> 27:19.114
Oh, no, we definitely did.

27:19.139 --> 27:20.742
We're having this whole Beyoncé-themed

27:20.767 --> 27:24.000
lemonade party tonight,
because, duh, Beyoncé.

27:24.025 --> 27:26.352
But, my husband really loves...

27:26.377 --> 27:28.906
Wow, we're still talking about this?

27:28.931 --> 27:31.781
I'm sorry.
We're expecting a huge turnout tonight,

27:31.806 --> 27:34.607
so if your husband is
dying for some lemonade,

27:34.632 --> 27:36.225
you can make it yourself.

27:36.500 --> 27:38.305
You're gonna give me three bottles

27:38.330 --> 27:39.789
before I beat them out of you.

27:39.814 --> 27:41.347
- Whoa.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:41.372 --> 27:42.798
What did you just say to me?

27:42.823 --> 27:44.461
- You heard me.
- Mom, it's. uh...

27:44.486 --> 27:46.281
I have bras older than you.

27:46.306 --> 27:47.563
That's not even a diss.

27:47.588 --> 27:50.516
Oh, it's a diss. It's a damn diss!

27:50.540 --> 27:52.828
- You want to get in here?
- Mom, let's get out of here...

27:52.853 --> 27:54.540
- Give me the damn lemonade.
- Not a chance.

27:54.564 --> 27:55.931
- Okay, I'm getting this.
- Stop it!

27:55.955 --> 27:58.250
We're getting this on tape
just so you know, crazy lady.

27:58.275 --> 27:59.329
I'm getting it on tape, too.

27:59.353 --> 28:00.374
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

28:00.399 --> 28:01.399
Where?

28:04.064 --> 28:06.177
Everyone I've reached out
to either isn't available or

28:06.201 --> 28:08.434
doesn't want to be a
last-minute fill-in for Charlie.

28:08.459 --> 28:10.180
How 'bout Jeff Bezos...

28:10.205 --> 28:11.538
... 's niece?

28:11.563 --> 28:13.477
I-I know Katie Zuckerberg.

28:13.502 --> 28:15.375
- No relation to Mark.
- What?

28:15.400 --> 28:16.933
All right, uh,
I don't want to say anything,

28:16.957 --> 28:19.320
but I may have a direct
line to Shigeru Miyamoto.

28:19.345 --> 28:21.944
What? The best game designer ever?
Mister Nintendo?

28:21.969 --> 28:23.017
Why didn't you lead with that?

28:23.041 --> 28:25.477
Um, also how do you
know such a big baller?

28:25.502 --> 28:28.492
He's just a family connection,
but it's a really big ask,

28:28.517 --> 28:30.492
and I can only call in this favor once,

28:30.517 --> 28:33.008
so are we sure we want
me to press this button?

28:33.033 --> 28:35.195
- I mean, it's do-or-die time.
- Yeah.

28:35.797 --> 28:37.342
Okay. I'm on it. Yeah.

28:37.378 --> 28:38.587
If Shigeru hops on a plane right now,

28:38.611 --> 28:40.875
he can make it from Kyoto in 14 hours.

28:40.900 --> 28:42.099
I'll be right back.

28:42.124 --> 28:43.156
What?

28:43.181 --> 28:44.836
People, good news.

28:44.861 --> 28:46.110
Charlie's back in.

28:46.135 --> 28:47.625
- Yeah!
- Yes!

28:47.650 --> 28:49.852
- Okay... Okay.
- Still a lot to do.

28:52.850 --> 28:53.850
What happened?

28:53.875 --> 28:54.922
Did Charlie apologize...

28:54.947 --> 28:56.391
We got him. That's what matters.

28:56.416 --> 28:58.914
Okay. Okay, but are you okay, because...

28:58.939 --> 29:00.695
Focus on your team, Zoey.

29:04.482 --> 29:07.094
It's amazing! It is on, people.

29:07.119 --> 29:09.297
Shigeru Miyamoto is in.

29:09.322 --> 29:10.891
I called in my one-time-only favor

29:10.916 --> 29:14.320
and got the big man himself.
How you like me now?

29:17.531 --> 29:18.922
Charlie's back in, isn't he?

29:18.947 --> 29:20.860
- Yeah.
- Really?

29:21.257 --> 29:23.867
Okay. Well, we're happy.

29:23.892 --> 29:25.406
Is she happy? Joan happy?

29:26.727 --> 29:28.627
Gotta make a call.

29:32.965 --> 29:36.679
And... this is where I work.

29:36.704 --> 29:38.641
Huh. Where do you want me to set up?

29:39.180 --> 29:41.391
You're not gonna say
anything about this place?

29:41.416 --> 29:43.453
Honey, I snuck onto Elton John's yacht.

29:43.478 --> 29:44.805
This is literally nothing.

29:44.830 --> 29:46.781
There he is.

29:46.806 --> 29:49.218
Oh, snap, are you gonna
play actual records tomorrow?

29:49.243 --> 29:50.439
You know, I've been known
to keep it old-school.

29:50.463 --> 29:52.461
That's what up.
Let me grab these for you.

29:52.486 --> 29:53.886
Oh, thank you.

29:54.045 --> 29:55.711
So chivalrous.

29:55.736 --> 29:57.867
You know, I'm officially on
the record as Team Simon.

29:58.231 --> 30:01.180
Mm-mm. What's wrong? What did Simon do?

30:01.205 --> 30:02.298
You know I got my fighting nails on.

30:02.322 --> 30:03.600
I'm like Wolverine, but daintier.

30:03.624 --> 30:07.203
No, Simon didn't do anything.

30:07.228 --> 30:09.896
It's, uh... It's Joan.

30:10.328 --> 30:11.375
I don't know why,

30:11.400 --> 30:14.167
but I feel like I'm not
finished helping her yet.

30:14.192 --> 30:15.759
Are you still being haunted by her song?

30:15.783 --> 30:19.752
No. I feel like I'm
just worried about her.

30:19.777 --> 30:21.977
Wait. So you want to help her

30:22.002 --> 30:24.094
just because you want to help her?

30:24.317 --> 30:26.422
Zoey Clarke,
are you growing as a person?

30:26.447 --> 30:27.516
No.

30:27.541 --> 30:28.664
Her husband's a dick.

30:28.689 --> 30:29.989
It's a girl-power thing.

30:30.014 --> 30:31.292
I scream out when I see injustice.

30:31.316 --> 30:33.125
Stop looking at me.

30:33.891 --> 30:35.664
Is everything all right?

30:35.689 --> 30:38.133
<i>Can you go be with Dad?
Emily has a partner dinner,</i>

30:38.158 --> 30:40.016
<i>and Mom and I are still at the store.</i>

30:40.576 --> 30:43.070
Didn't you say you were
heading out, like, two hours ago?

30:43.095 --> 30:44.867
We got held up.

30:50.847 --> 30:52.547
Well, we're back.

30:53.354 --> 30:54.753
And the good news is

30:54.778 --> 30:57.145
I've been banned from the grocery store.

30:58.132 --> 30:59.531
For life.

31:04.513 --> 31:06.000
I'll be back.

31:08.779 --> 31:11.514
Okay, Mom is doing
way worse than we thought.

31:11.539 --> 31:12.797
I told you.

31:12.822 --> 31:15.797
I guess we've been so
focused on taking care of Dad

31:15.822 --> 31:17.221
that we weren't even thinking

31:17.246 --> 31:19.235
about how hard this
all must be on Mom, too.

31:19.260 --> 31:21.700
She always seems like she's
so on top of everything, you know?

31:22.088 --> 31:23.089
Look, at the end of the day,

31:23.113 --> 31:25.963
we get to leave here,
we get to go back to our lives, but...

31:26.252 --> 31:28.353
this is her life.

31:28.378 --> 31:30.236
Mom is my responsibility, too,

31:30.261 --> 31:32.713
and I'm starting to realize that...

31:33.732 --> 31:36.733
problems don't just go
away if I ignore them.

31:37.146 --> 31:38.822
You're just... You're
just realizing this?

31:38.847 --> 31:40.017
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, okay.

31:40.042 --> 31:41.454
There's been a radical shift in the way

31:41.478 --> 31:42.839
I perceive the world.
You wouldn't understand.

31:42.863 --> 31:44.908
I guess not. Look, why don't we do this?

31:44.933 --> 31:46.737
Why don't we put together
some sort of a schedule

31:46.761 --> 31:48.487
with each other where
we can get a Mom a break

31:48.511 --> 31:49.784
before she has, like, another...

31:49.808 --> 31:51.728
complete meltdown on aisle five?

31:51.753 --> 31:53.064
Yeah, let's do that.

31:53.205 --> 31:55.705
But, um, first,

31:55.730 --> 31:58.002
we have to convince her
to go along with that.

31:58.027 --> 32:00.094
You're right. She's
gonna put up a fight.

32:00.695 --> 32:02.533
The woman is terrifying.

32:07.384 --> 32:08.744
Kinda hard to finish coding

32:08.769 --> 32:10.588
in the middle of Disney's
Electrical Parade.

32:10.613 --> 32:13.861
Really? I find I do my best
programming in da club.

32:14.190 --> 32:16.259
Kevin, can I see the, uh...

32:16.284 --> 32:17.431
Oh, God!

32:17.456 --> 32:19.509
I said dramatic lighting,
not interrogation room.

32:19.534 --> 32:21.467
What am I, living in a flashlight?

32:21.492 --> 32:23.799
- Can you bring that down?
- Well, looks like old Joan is back.

32:23.823 --> 32:25.182
You know, I don't know if those balloons

32:25.206 --> 32:27.657
say "launch party" or
"my nephew's bar mitzvah."

32:27.682 --> 32:29.556
- I'm not even Jewish.
- I'll be right back.

32:29.581 --> 32:31.494
Do you guys even work here?
You have two collars.

32:31.518 --> 32:33.267
Wh... Pick one. Go. Get out of here.

32:33.292 --> 32:35.693
Joan, can I talk to you for a second?

32:35.833 --> 32:39.571
I know it's not my place, but...

32:40.090 --> 32:45.594
you opened up to me the
other night for a reason,

32:45.902 --> 32:47.423
and...

32:48.384 --> 32:52.052
if you ever want to
talk about it again...

32:53.332 --> 32:54.544
I'm here.

32:54.569 --> 32:56.502
Okay.

32:59.656 --> 33:01.690
I had to beg him to come back.

33:13.329 --> 33:15.435
I had to apologize to him...

33:17.570 --> 33:20.575
even though he's the one
who threatened to leave.

33:21.179 --> 33:25.348
And it's not the first time
he's bailed on me like that.

33:27.313 --> 33:29.599
And yet somehow,
for some reason, I keep...

33:30.403 --> 33:32.263
working on it.

33:33.837 --> 33:37.519
'Cause the idea of losing
Charlie feels worse than...

33:39.526 --> 33:41.004
this.

33:42.766 --> 33:44.399
Whatever this is.

33:46.298 --> 33:47.864
Well, I can't tell you what to do,

33:47.889 --> 33:51.902
and I am definitely
not one to judge, but...

33:54.546 --> 33:56.949
you deserve to be satisfied.

34:04.052 --> 34:05.718
Oh. Sorry I'm late.

34:05.743 --> 34:07.343
I left these at the BART station,

34:07.368 --> 34:10.101
and I had to go back,
because these shoes, well,

34:10.127 --> 34:11.887
apparently they're
worth more than my life.

34:11.911 --> 34:13.449
Look, I told you
we can do this another time.

34:13.474 --> 34:15.831
- I know you have your event.
- No, no, I'm making time.

34:15.857 --> 34:18.129
Okay, remember, be strong.

34:18.154 --> 34:20.487
And take any sharp
objects out of her hands.

34:21.514 --> 34:22.714
Hey, uh, Mom...

34:22.739 --> 34:26.465
We want to float an idea by you.

34:26.489 --> 34:28.518
Is this an intervention?

34:29.996 --> 34:33.347
I told you I got a great night of sleep.

34:33.371 --> 34:35.176
I'm way less crabby now.

34:35.201 --> 34:37.768
I even sent the Kappa
Alphas a nice fern.

34:37.793 --> 34:40.355
We just want to talk to you
about helping out with Dad more.

34:40.380 --> 34:42.313
We want to give you some time off.

34:43.601 --> 34:46.972
Time off from my husband?

34:46.996 --> 34:49.197
You've taken on this all
yourself for far too long.

34:49.222 --> 34:53.491
But he is my life partner.
You kids have your own lives.

34:54.462 --> 34:57.710
And you know he would
say the same thing.

34:57.735 --> 34:59.168
Mom...

35:01.174 --> 35:04.629
there is nothing in the world

35:04.654 --> 35:06.676
that I love more than your smile.

35:07.849 --> 35:10.049
But not if it isn't real.

35:11.518 --> 35:15.082
So maybe if we can just take
a little bit off your plate...

35:15.835 --> 35:18.332
you can find that real smile again.

35:41.966 --> 35:43.137
Okay.

35:43.162 --> 35:45.590
_

35:48.345 --> 35:50.612
"Let them help."

35:54.607 --> 35:55.973
Okay.

36:12.232 --> 36:14.152
Oh, well, excuse me.

36:14.177 --> 36:16.982
Are you my friend Zoey's
self-actualized sister,

36:17.007 --> 36:18.974
or did someone have a major glow-up?

36:18.999 --> 36:22.521
Wow, you look amazing, Mo.

36:22.546 --> 36:24.846
Zoey, you clean up, too, I guess.

36:24.871 --> 36:26.607
What did you do to your hair?

36:26.632 --> 36:27.990
I can't tell if I love it or I hate it.

36:28.014 --> 36:30.535
Max let me put a little
natural product in there.

36:30.560 --> 36:33.504
It's a combination of
hemp seed and CBD oil.

36:33.529 --> 36:35.107
Yeah, not only does
it give your hair body,

36:35.131 --> 36:36.771
it also makes you
just a little bit high.

36:37.825 --> 36:39.536
We're gonna go get a couple Sprqtinis.

36:39.561 --> 36:41.039
Yeah, which are just regular martinis

36:41.063 --> 36:42.930
made by people with social disorders.

36:43.450 --> 36:46.374
The thing is, Max is funny,
and funny always wins.

36:46.399 --> 36:49.044
All right, lock it in: I'm Team Max.

36:49.376 --> 36:52.791
He is literally here
with a girl he's dating.

36:52.816 --> 36:54.802
- Eh. Mm.
- Unavailable, Mo.

36:54.827 --> 36:56.771
Okay, I know that you need the press,

36:56.796 --> 37:01.032
but can we speed this along?
I have a hard out at 9:30. Hi.

37:01.057 --> 37:02.216
What?

37:02.241 --> 37:04.029
Uh, 9:30? Hi.

37:04.054 --> 37:06.455
I-I thought I had you all... all night.

37:06.480 --> 37:08.568
Huh? No, never agreed to that.

37:08.593 --> 37:10.810
Don't make this into a thing right now.

37:10.835 --> 37:13.286
Come on. Cameras are flashing.

37:17.255 --> 37:19.614
I-I think you might want

37:19.639 --> 37:23.146
to get comfortable in your
suite at the Fairmont,

37:23.171 --> 37:27.177
because I think you're gonna
be there for a long time.

37:28.552 --> 37:30.763
I'm demoing your product in 20 minutes.

37:30.788 --> 37:32.747
You sure you want to do this now?

37:33.665 --> 37:36.279
I should have done this years ago.

37:50.273 --> 37:51.888
Did I just see Charlie leave?

37:52.742 --> 37:54.161
Yeah.

37:55.093 --> 37:56.974
I'm just gonna go out
and make a couple, uh,

37:56.999 --> 37:58.708
short remarks to the media,

37:58.733 --> 38:02.535
tell them we'll release
an online demo next week.

38:03.885 --> 38:05.700
Is that his watch?

38:05.725 --> 38:07.842
Oh, yes.

38:08.358 --> 38:10.735
He handed it to me like
it was his wedding ring.

38:10.760 --> 38:12.208
It's fitting, actually.

38:12.233 --> 38:15.735
Our marriage has always
been more of a business.

38:15.760 --> 38:18.208
Well, you know, you don't really
need Charlie to do the demo.

38:18.576 --> 38:20.612
Who's gonna do it? You?

38:20.637 --> 38:22.443
No, you.

38:24.071 --> 38:26.572
You know this watch better than anyone.

38:29.946 --> 38:31.212
You might be right.

happened with Charlie, though.

It's okay to dance, Simon.

41:01.868 --> 41:03.575
All right.
