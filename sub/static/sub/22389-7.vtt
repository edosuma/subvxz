00:20.370 --> 00:21.670
[cheers and applause]

00:21.670 --> 00:24.370
- From the Penn & Teller Theater
in Las Vegas, Nevada,

00:24.370 --> 00:28.070
here's our host,
Alyson Hannigan.

00:28.070 --> 00:31.070
[jazz music]

00:31.070 --> 00:37.530
â™ª â™ª

00:37.530 --> 00:39.030
[cheers and applause]

00:39.030 --> 00:40.299
- Hi.
Wow.

00:40.299 --> 00:41.299
Thank you.

00:41.299 --> 00:43.729
[cheers and applause]

00:43.729 --> 00:47.200
Welcome to "Penn & Teller:
Fool Us."

00:47.200 --> 00:48.670
Normally on this show,

00:48.670 --> 00:51.869
magicians try to pull one over
on Penn and Teller.

00:51.869 --> 00:55.530
But those guys are so hard
to fool that tonight,

00:55.530 --> 00:56.929
we're gonna switch things up,

00:56.929 --> 01:00.530
and the magicians
are gonna try to fool me.

01:00.530 --> 01:02.070
What?

01:02.070 --> 01:04.500
Wha--oh.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.569
Turns out that was just a joke.

01:06.569 --> 01:08.299
Okay.

01:08.299 --> 01:10.730
All right, let's go back
to the original format

01:10.730 --> 01:14.400
and bring out the men
of the hour, Penn and Teller!

01:14.400 --> 01:17.400
[jazz music]

01:17.400 --> 01:22.430
â™ª â™ª

01:22.430 --> 01:24.129
[cheers and applause]

01:24.129 --> 01:25.170
Whoo!

01:25.170 --> 01:26.870
[cheers and applause]

01:26.870 --> 01:29.870
Penn and Teller!

01:29.870 --> 01:30.969
Whoo!

01:30.969 --> 01:33.530
Remember, anyone
who fools Penn and Teller

01:33.530 --> 01:35.329
wins an all-expense-paid trip

01:35.329 --> 01:37.900
to Las Vegas to perform
with our headliners

01:37.900 --> 01:40.030
in their famous magic show.

01:40.030 --> 01:43.200
So let's meet our first
potential fooler.

01:45.500 --> 01:46.870
- I'm Vitaly Beckman.

01:46.870 --> 01:48.500
I'm an illusionist.

01:48.500 --> 01:51.069
â™ª â™ª

01:51.069 --> 01:53.299
I was born in the Soviet Union.

01:53.299 --> 01:56.000
Everybody was admiring
culture and art,

01:56.000 --> 01:58.530
and I always looked
at magic as an art form.

01:58.530 --> 02:00.930
Magic is very old.

02:00.930 --> 02:02.599
They say that, in the Pyramids,

02:02.599 --> 02:04.730
there are paintings
of somebodies

02:04.730 --> 02:06.969
doing the cups and balls.

02:06.969 --> 02:08.669
I used to paint as a kid.

02:08.669 --> 02:12.069
My act is about
bringing art to life.

02:12.069 --> 02:14.770
Sometimes I'm being
inspired from nature,

02:14.770 --> 02:18.199
like leaves falling off
a tree--as simple as that.

02:18.199 --> 02:21.099
I think that--not only
that magic can be art.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.670
I think that art is magic.

02:26.969 --> 02:31.199
- Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Vitaly Beckman.

02:31.199 --> 02:34.370
[cheers and applause]

02:34.370 --> 02:36.329
- Thank you.

02:36.329 --> 02:37.870
My name is Vitaly,

02:37.870 --> 02:41.170
and although that name
sounds Italian,

02:41.170 --> 02:44.199
I was actually born
in Soviet Union.

02:44.199 --> 02:46.170
And since I speak English,

02:46.170 --> 02:49.199
but talk Russian,

02:49.199 --> 02:50.900
I sound like Borat.

02:50.900 --> 02:53.069
[laughter]

02:53.069 --> 02:54.729
And I look like Seinfeld.

02:54.729 --> 02:56.900
[laughter]

02:56.900 --> 02:59.329
But hey,
speaking of celebrities,

02:59.329 --> 03:00.800
Alyson, would you help me out?

03:00.800 --> 03:01.870
- Oh, sure.

03:01.870 --> 03:03.030
- Let's hear it
for Alyson Hannigan.

03:03.030 --> 03:06.300
- Aw.
[cheers and applause]

03:06.300 --> 03:08.370
- Thank you very much, Alyson.
- Oh, my pleasure.

03:08.370 --> 03:10.229
- Alyson, we haven't
prearranged anything, right?

03:10.229 --> 03:13.030
- No.
- Good, because I've got here

03:13.030 --> 03:14.199
a deck of playing cards.

03:14.199 --> 03:15.370
I'll ask you to hold on
to the box for me.

03:15.370 --> 03:17.199
Thank you.
And they're all different.

03:17.199 --> 03:18.569
And you know how
a lot of times,

03:18.569 --> 03:19.930
a magician
would have you select

03:19.930 --> 03:22.400
a card--
usually like so, right?

03:22.400 --> 03:23.400
- Yes.
- We're gonna try

03:23.400 --> 03:24.400
something different.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.770
I'll ask you to look at me.

03:25.770 --> 03:27.500
Stand facing the audience,
this way.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.900
I'm gonna hold the cards
like this.

03:29.900 --> 03:31.699
- Ooh.
- Okay, now you're going

03:31.699 --> 03:33.430
to say stop anytime,

03:33.430 --> 03:35.900
as I'm gonna go through
the cards one by one, okay?

03:35.900 --> 03:36.900
- Okay.
- Now remember,

03:36.900 --> 03:38.069
they're all different,

03:38.069 --> 03:40.270
so I don't care
which one you stop me at.

03:40.270 --> 03:42.370
- Stop.
- Right here?

03:42.370 --> 03:43.400
- Yes.
- Or do you want me

03:43.400 --> 03:45.569
to go a few more.
It's up to you.

03:45.569 --> 03:46.569
- No.
- Right here, yes?

03:46.569 --> 03:47.670
- Yeah.

03:47.670 --> 03:49.170
- Okay, could you
remember this card?

03:49.170 --> 03:50.270
- Yes.
- You remember it?

03:50.270 --> 03:51.670
- Yes.
- Okay, don't forget it,

03:51.670 --> 03:53.729
because I'm gonna lose it
in the deck.

03:53.729 --> 03:55.469
So make sure that you
do not forget it.

03:55.469 --> 03:56.870
I'll take the box back.

03:56.870 --> 04:00.270
Okay, we're gonna place it
in the box,

04:00.270 --> 04:02.900
and I'll ask you to hold on
to it like this, okay?

04:02.900 --> 04:03.900
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:03.900 --> 04:05.500
Now, you know,
since I was a kid,

04:05.500 --> 04:07.699
I was trying to guess
people's playing cards--

04:07.699 --> 04:09.469
before I even got into magic.

04:09.469 --> 04:11.030
And I've got a picture
to show you,

04:11.030 --> 04:13.800
when I was about three,
four years old,

04:13.800 --> 04:16.199
with a playing card in my hand.

04:16.199 --> 04:18.199
Now, wouldn't it be amazing

04:18.199 --> 04:21.129
if that card would be the one
you're thinking of now.

04:21.129 --> 04:22.399
- Yeah.
- Right?

04:22.399 --> 04:25.170
Well, here's
my family photo album,

04:25.170 --> 04:29.269
and here is me as a kid.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.670
- Ohh.
audience: Aww.

04:30.670 --> 04:31.699
- I was very small.

04:31.699 --> 04:35.569
[laughter]

04:35.569 --> 04:37.300
In Russia,
cards are very big.

04:37.300 --> 04:38.899
[laughter]

04:38.899 --> 04:40.000
Alyson.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.930
- Yeah?
- Is that--

04:41.930 --> 04:42.930
you look disappointed.

04:42.930 --> 04:44.230
Is that the card?

04:44.230 --> 04:46.629
- No, but you're
really cute.

04:46.629 --> 04:47.629
[laughter]

04:47.629 --> 04:48.699
- I am, huh?

04:48.699 --> 04:49.970
- Yeah.
- So it's not the--no,

04:49.970 --> 04:51.269
but you're serious?
It's not the card?

04:51.269 --> 04:53.230
- It's not.
- You know, I wasn't into magic.

04:53.230 --> 04:56.029
I was very small.
But when I was eight years old,

04:56.029 --> 04:58.370
my parents,
they bought me a magic set,

04:58.370 --> 05:02.269
and I did my first card trick.
Is that the one?

05:02.269 --> 05:05.699
- Ah, still no,
but very cute.

05:05.699 --> 05:07.230
- So you like
my cuteness,

05:07.230 --> 05:08.230
but it's not the card.

05:08.230 --> 05:10.370
- Right.
- Okay, but you know what?

05:10.370 --> 05:12.600
I got better
a few years later.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.569
I became bigger too.

05:14.569 --> 05:15.829
I started to travel.

05:15.829 --> 05:18.699
Here I am in Paris.

05:18.699 --> 05:20.370
- Oh!
- Jack of clubs.

05:20.370 --> 05:22.000
- Oh.
- Alyson?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.870
No?
- No.

05:23.870 --> 05:25.300
- I've got a lot
more photographs here.

05:25.300 --> 05:26.769
- 52?

05:26.769 --> 05:28.600
- Yeah, I traveled
to 52 places.

05:28.600 --> 05:29.600
- Great.

05:29.600 --> 05:32.470
[laughter]

05:32.470 --> 05:33.529
Get comfortable.

05:33.529 --> 05:34.529
[laughter]

05:34.529 --> 05:36.230
- We have time, right?

05:36.230 --> 05:38.029
Alyson, okay, for
the first time,

05:38.029 --> 05:40.199
what card you're thinking of?
Tell us.

05:40.199 --> 05:42.529
- Eight of clubs.
- Eight of clubs?

05:42.529 --> 05:45.199
- Yes.
- Okay, since I got better

05:45.199 --> 05:46.600
with the years,

05:46.600 --> 05:49.129
I'm gonna show you
a recent photo.

05:49.129 --> 05:52.430
You see, on my way to the show,
I stopped over in London,

05:52.430 --> 05:55.870
and I took a picture
for all of you here tonight.

05:55.870 --> 05:57.699
It's the last photo here,

05:57.699 --> 06:02.029
of me in London
with the eight of clubs.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.769
- Huh.
- There was a lot of traffic.

06:07.769 --> 06:10.300
- Right.
- You--do you see me, Alyson?

06:10.300 --> 06:11.300
- No, I don't.
- You don't, huh?

06:11.300 --> 06:12.370
- I don't.
- And the card--

06:12.370 --> 06:13.730
you don't see
eight of clubs?

06:13.730 --> 06:15.829
- Uh, not--no.
- No?

06:15.829 --> 06:17.800
- I'm sorry.
- Alyson, let's have a look

06:17.800 --> 06:18.800
at it a little closer.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.029
- Okay.

06:20.029 --> 06:22.629
[horns honking,
brakes squealing]

06:22.629 --> 06:24.470
- Did you hear that?
- I heard that.

06:24.470 --> 06:25.529
- Listen one more time.

06:25.529 --> 06:30.370
[horns honking,
brakes squealing]

06:30.370 --> 06:32.699
[engine turns over]

06:32.699 --> 06:35.699
[engine rumbling]

06:39.370 --> 06:42.370
[brakes squealing]

06:43.899 --> 06:45.629
[engine rumbling
cuts off abruptly]

06:45.629 --> 06:47.600
- That is so cool.
[cheers and applause]

06:47.600 --> 06:48.800
- Thank you.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.129
Actually,
you know what, Alyson?

06:50.129 --> 06:51.399
Let me take this out
for you.

06:51.399 --> 06:54.199
I want you to see this up close.
So have a look, Alyson.

06:54.199 --> 06:56.000
- What?
- Is this a regular photograph?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.470
- Yes.
- Yes?

06:57.470 --> 07:00.670
- Yes. That is so cool.
- And--thank you very much.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.170
You can keep this
as a souvenir.

07:02.170 --> 07:03.800
Big hand to Alyson,
everybody.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.670
- Oh, thank you!
[cheers and applause]

07:05.670 --> 07:07.100
Vitaly Beckman, everybody.

07:07.100 --> 07:09.269
- Thank you guys.
- That is so cute.

07:09.269 --> 07:11.300
- Thank you.
[cheers and applause]

07:11.300 --> 07:12.600
- Wow.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.870
That is just so incredible.

07:14.870 --> 07:17.029
And you came up
with that yourself.

07:17.029 --> 07:19.170
- Yes, I actually invent
all of the illusions

07:19.170 --> 07:21.769
that I do in my shows,
and this one I developed

07:21.769 --> 07:23.470
about six, seven years ago.

07:23.470 --> 07:24.529
And I actually do

07:24.529 --> 07:26.300
a lot of different things
with photographs.

07:26.300 --> 07:27.399
That was just one.

07:27.399 --> 07:29.800
I make people disappear
from their photograph,

07:29.800 --> 07:31.029
appear in
another picture.

07:31.029 --> 07:32.500
At one show,
I had people

07:32.500 --> 07:34.730
bring their home photographs
to the show,

07:34.730 --> 07:37.069
and I removed them
from their own photographs.

07:37.069 --> 07:39.629
- That could be very useful
when you, you know,

07:39.629 --> 07:41.399
have a great photo of you

07:41.399 --> 07:43.829
and your friends
and, like, an ex-boyfriend,

07:43.829 --> 07:46.600
and you're like, "Ugh,
I wish he weren't in the photo."

07:46.600 --> 07:48.730
You could just
magically disappear him.

07:48.730 --> 07:50.569
- I could.
- Do you think you have

07:50.569 --> 07:51.699
a shot at fooling them?

07:51.699 --> 07:53.170
- Well, to be honest,
I don't know.

07:53.170 --> 07:54.170
- All right,

07:54.170 --> 07:55.430
but let's check in
with Penn

07:55.430 --> 07:57.100
and Teller and see
if you did fool them.

07:57.100 --> 07:59.230
- All right, let's see. Let's--
- All right, boys.

07:59.230 --> 08:02.399
- Ah, Vitaly,
it's so good--so good

08:02.399 --> 08:05.500
to see an act
that has animation in it--

08:05.500 --> 08:07.569
animation
where things move,

08:07.569 --> 08:11.470
and you see them,
and then it's not an iPad.

08:11.470 --> 08:13.670
It's not a screen.

08:13.670 --> 08:17.129
There's something so magical--
you know, 30 years ago,

08:17.129 --> 08:19.269
if you did a trick
and had a flat screen

08:19.269 --> 08:20.670
where something moved,

08:20.670 --> 08:23.100
that'd be the most magical thing
you could've seen.

08:23.100 --> 08:26.300
Now, in the 21st century,
the most magical thing

08:26.300 --> 08:29.829
you can do is pull out
a good old printed picture

08:29.829 --> 08:31.529
and show that to people
as a miracle.

08:31.529 --> 08:33.070
I want to praise you on that.

08:33.070 --> 08:34.570
- Thank you.
- And I want to also--

08:34.570 --> 08:36.669
where'd you say you were from?
- I was born in Russia.

08:36.669 --> 08:38.269
- And how much do you know
about baseball?

08:38.269 --> 08:39.330
- Not much.

08:39.330 --> 08:40.470
- Well, you know
that there's the--

08:40.470 --> 08:41.830
- I know they spit.
- What's that?

08:41.830 --> 08:44.029
They spit. They spit,
and they throw a ball around.

08:44.029 --> 08:45.669
- They're not gonna spit on you.
I'm pretty sure.

08:45.669 --> 08:47.799
- And you also might know that
there's not just one out.

08:47.799 --> 08:50.100
There's not just two out,
but there's multiple outs.

08:50.100 --> 08:51.470
Did you know
that about baseball?

08:51.470 --> 08:53.529
- Right. I think you're trying
to give me a code

08:53.529 --> 08:55.169
with multiple outs.
- Yeah.

08:55.169 --> 08:57.429
- And that's not true.
- That's not true?

08:57.429 --> 08:58.629
- No.
- Oh.

08:58.629 --> 09:00.070
- There's no multiple outs.
- No.

09:00.070 --> 09:01.600
- Oh, oh.
- Only one way it can go.

09:01.600 --> 09:02.700
- Yes.

09:02.700 --> 09:04.200
- And there's no, uh,
limited--and

09:04.200 --> 09:07.429
there--could she have really
picked any one of 52 cards?

09:07.429 --> 09:09.200
- Well, she--did you have
a free choice?

09:09.200 --> 09:10.399
- Yes.

09:10.399 --> 09:13.269
- So I want to say,
if we can't welcome you

09:13.269 --> 09:16.100
by saying baseball
has multiple outs,

09:16.100 --> 09:17.330
we can welcome you to America

09:17.330 --> 09:19.370
by saying you fooled
Penn and Teller.

09:19.370 --> 09:23.000
- Oh!
[cheers and applause]

09:23.000 --> 09:28.700
Congratulations!
Oh, you did it.

09:28.700 --> 09:31.370
Oh, congrats.

09:31.370 --> 09:33.029
- Thank you, Teller.

09:33.029 --> 09:36.230
- Vitaly Beckman
fooled Penn and Teller!

09:36.230 --> 09:38.299
[cheers and applause]

09:38.299 --> 09:40.399
Oh, congratulations.

09:40.399 --> 09:41.570
- Thank you again.
Thank you.

09:41.570 --> 09:44.129
[cheers and applause]

09:44.129 --> 09:45.870
- Penn and Teller
have been fooled!

09:45.870 --> 09:49.000
Let's see if it can
happen again when we come back.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
[cheers and applause]

09:58.769 --> 10:01.570
[jazz music]

10:01.570 --> 10:04.529
[cheers and applause]

10:04.529 --> 10:06.230
- Welcome back to "Fool Us."

10:06.230 --> 10:08.200
We've had one act fool Penn
and Teller

10:08.200 --> 10:10.299
and earn a trip back
to Las Vegas.

10:10.299 --> 10:13.600
Let's see if we've got
another fooler in the house.

10:15.629 --> 10:16.730
- My name is Simon Coronel.

10:16.730 --> 10:18.100
I'm from Melbourne, Australia,

10:18.100 --> 10:23.370
and I'm a magician/illusionist
/engineer/polymath.

10:23.370 --> 10:26.200
My childhood hero was MacGyver.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.899
MacGyver's superpower
has using human ingenuity

10:28.899 --> 10:31.529
to do things
that looked impossible.

10:31.529 --> 10:34.330
I was 18, doing a degree
in psychology

10:34.330 --> 10:36.000
and software engineering,

10:36.000 --> 10:39.299
and I saw a magician
showing a card trick.

10:39.299 --> 10:40.529
I was mind blown.
And you know,

10:40.529 --> 10:42.669
the scientist and engineer
in me was just like,

10:42.669 --> 10:44.870
"I want to understand.
I want to work this out."

10:44.870 --> 10:46.700
One time, I was working
on a trick--

10:46.700 --> 10:48.629
I literally started,
like, doing the algebra.

10:48.629 --> 10:50.899
And then it actually
worked for the trick.

10:50.899 --> 10:52.429
The art of magic and illusion

10:52.429 --> 10:55.269
is the most fascinating thing
I've ever studied in my life.

10:55.269 --> 10:59.070
[cheers and applause]

10:59.070 --> 11:02.029
- Please welcome Simon Coronel.

11:02.029 --> 11:05.029
[cheers and applause]

11:10.029 --> 11:11.629
- G'day.

11:11.629 --> 11:13.669
So I like to lean into the fact

11:13.669 --> 11:15.470
that this stuff is done
through slight of hand

11:15.470 --> 11:17.200
and misdirection
and human ingenuity.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.100
To me, that's so much
more of an amazing thing

11:19.100 --> 11:21.700
to share than the pretense
of magical powers.

11:21.700 --> 11:23.129
Let me give you an example.

11:23.129 --> 11:25.730
I'm gonna create the illusion
for you tonight

11:25.730 --> 11:28.500
of these poker chips traveling,

11:28.500 --> 11:30.429
apparently impossibly,
from one hand--my

11:30.429 --> 11:32.269
right hand--over
to my left hand,

11:32.269 --> 11:33.669
one at a time.

11:33.669 --> 11:35.600
Doesn't seem like a big deal,
but if there was a way

11:35.600 --> 11:37.370
to do that without
you seeing them go across,

11:37.370 --> 11:39.970
that would be something
to write home about.

11:39.970 --> 11:44.370
So here we go--one at a time,
from hand A to hand B.

11:50.070 --> 11:51.730
Okay, I should explain,
before we do this,

11:51.730 --> 11:54.200
that it happens when you're not
actually expecting it to.

11:54.200 --> 11:56.870
audience: Ooh.

11:56.870 --> 11:59.870
[applause]

12:04.799 --> 12:07.100
Now, the reason
that's possible is

12:07.100 --> 12:08.769
because even if
you're focusing really,

12:08.769 --> 12:11.100
really closely on the chips,

12:11.100 --> 12:13.230
you can't split your attention

12:13.230 --> 12:14.870
and look
at what my wrists are doing

12:14.870 --> 12:17.330
or what's happening down
on my elbows or up on my face.

12:17.330 --> 12:19.929
You get distracted for just
a second and miss the moment,

12:19.929 --> 12:22.370
as it apparently goes across.
audience: Ooh.

12:22.370 --> 12:25.370
[cheers and applause]

12:29.269 --> 12:31.200
Okay, third time's the charm.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.669
See, now that
you've seen this twice,

12:32.669 --> 12:34.269
your pattern recognition's
kicking in.

12:34.269 --> 12:36.169
You're exponentially
harder to catch with it.

12:36.169 --> 12:39.070
So most of you will probably
actually see it this time.

12:39.070 --> 12:41.029
Here we go--third chip.

12:41.029 --> 12:43.100
[sighs deeply]

12:43.100 --> 12:47.200
No pressure.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.870
[laughter]
I mean, I said you'd see it.

12:48.870 --> 12:51.200
I wasn't lying.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.070
Okay, all right, that sucks.

12:53.070 --> 12:56.129
I'm sorry.
Let's try it again.

12:56.129 --> 12:57.629
Yeah, see, it's true.

12:57.629 --> 12:59.399
If I had just done
the same thing a third time,

12:59.399 --> 13:00.570
you would've caught it.

13:00.570 --> 13:02.370
I had to change the moment
for it to work.

13:02.370 --> 13:04.870
Final chip for realsies
this time.

13:04.870 --> 13:08.470
Let's see--yeah, it's a word.
It's part of the vernacular.

13:08.470 --> 13:10.600
The thing is,
though--the problem is,

13:10.600 --> 13:12.870
you guys are now basically
the most attentive

13:12.870 --> 13:15.470
I think you might have been
all day, at this point,

13:15.470 --> 13:16.769
and there is no force on Earth

13:16.769 --> 13:19.529
that is gonna make you look away
from that poker chip.

13:19.529 --> 13:22.399
So I have to do something
different and more elaborate:

13:22.399 --> 13:23.570
hide it

13:23.570 --> 13:24.929
so that even though
you know where it is,

13:24.929 --> 13:27.129
you can't be 100%
certain anymore;

13:27.129 --> 13:30.000
change the position to try and
confuse your motion tracking;

13:30.000 --> 13:32.769
even bluff as to where
it actually gets to,

13:32.769 --> 13:35.570
and make it
completely disappear.

13:35.570 --> 13:36.830
- Oh!

13:36.830 --> 13:39.230
- Okay, no, really,
make it completely disappear

13:39.230 --> 13:41.870
but it still traveled
back to the hand.

13:41.870 --> 13:44.370
[cheers and applause]
- Wow.

13:44.370 --> 13:46.700
Simon Coronel,

13:46.700 --> 13:49.330
that was amazing.

13:49.330 --> 13:52.870
Ah, that was fantastic.

13:52.870 --> 13:54.700
Oh, my goodness. Okay.
- That seemed to go okay.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.570
I was pretty happy about that.
It felt good.

13:56.570 --> 13:59.330
- Look--look at Teller's face.
- He seems happy, I think.

13:59.330 --> 14:01.029
I'm glad.
- I know. That's so cool.

14:01.029 --> 14:03.470
Yeah, so were you just lying
to us the whole time?

14:03.470 --> 14:05.700
- I mean, everything
I said was true,

14:05.700 --> 14:07.330
but a lot of it was misleading.

14:07.330 --> 14:08.830
- Oh. It's--

14:08.830 --> 14:10.230
- Which is--again, I mean,
one of the things--like,

14:10.230 --> 14:12.000
for me, I want to be able
to tell as much of the truth

14:12.000 --> 14:13.399
as you can--truth as you can.

14:13.399 --> 14:14.669
- Mm-hmm.
- To me, it's frustrating

14:14.669 --> 14:16.399
that you have to lie
about anything of it at all.

14:16.399 --> 14:17.929
- Right.
- But you do have to, sadly,

14:17.929 --> 14:19.029
to create the illusion.

14:19.029 --> 14:20.070
Otherwise,
there wouldn't be any.

14:20.070 --> 14:22.299
- Right.
So was magic your first love?

14:22.299 --> 14:23.570
- Not at all.

14:23.570 --> 14:25.029
Like, it used to be I wanted
to program video games.

14:25.029 --> 14:27.370
That was actually my career
dream when I was in high school.

14:27.370 --> 14:28.769
And so all that
math and science,

14:28.769 --> 14:30.230
it's amazing
how applicable it is

14:30.230 --> 14:31.929
when you're designing and
innovating with new illusions

14:31.929 --> 14:33.330
and trying to find ways
to do it better.

14:33.330 --> 14:34.629
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

14:34.629 --> 14:36.169
- Let's check in
with Penn and Teller.

14:36.169 --> 14:37.529
- Cool.

14:37.529 --> 14:39.100
- Boys?

14:39.100 --> 14:43.029
- In comedy and in--
and in magic,

14:43.029 --> 14:48.230
I love it when you use the truth
to get where you're going.

14:48.230 --> 14:51.399
I love hanging this
on misdirection,

14:51.399 --> 14:53.200
hanging this on us
looking at it,

14:53.200 --> 14:56.230
doing the whole thing
right out there in the front.

14:56.230 --> 14:59.970
I love that you're doing it
with chips instead of coins.

14:59.970 --> 15:03.269
There's something that
the audience may not think about

15:03.269 --> 15:06.100
because they may not know
as much as we know,

15:06.100 --> 15:08.970
but coins are all
the same color,

15:08.970 --> 15:10.730
and chips are not,

15:10.730 --> 15:13.070
and that makes this much,

15:13.070 --> 15:15.929
much harder and much,
much cooler.

15:15.929 --> 15:19.600
And I love the fact that it's
right out there in our face,

15:19.600 --> 15:21.169
and I love your timing,

15:21.169 --> 15:22.269
and I love the fact that,

15:22.269 --> 15:23.669
at certain times,

15:23.669 --> 15:26.500
you're really telling the truth.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.500
We are familiar with Free Fly,

15:28.500 --> 15:30.629
and it is a version of that.

15:30.629 --> 15:33.370
No, that's not right.
It's not a version of that.

15:33.370 --> 15:34.929
It's the best version of that.

15:34.929 --> 15:36.029
It's really wonderful.

15:36.029 --> 15:39.029
[cheers and applause]

15:41.269 --> 15:43.799
- So they love you,
and they said

15:43.799 --> 15:47.200
you were the best at Free Fly,
but is that--

15:47.200 --> 15:48.200
- We know what that is.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.429
- You know what that is.
- Uh, yeah.

15:49.429 --> 15:52.169
- So does that mean that
they know how you did--

15:52.169 --> 15:53.169
- Oh yeah, they know.

15:53.169 --> 15:54.169
- Aw.
- Yeah, that's okay.

15:54.169 --> 15:55.429
- But so good!
- Thank you.

15:55.429 --> 15:57.269
- But it was really good.
[cheers and applause]

15:57.269 --> 16:00.299
Well, thank you so much.

16:00.299 --> 16:02.399
- Thank you.
- Simon Coronel.

16:02.399 --> 16:03.429
- Thank you.

16:03.429 --> 16:07.730
[cheers and applause]

16:07.730 --> 16:09.029
- We'll be back in a minute,

16:09.029 --> 16:11.600
but I secretly think
we could be quicker.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.799
Time us.
We'll be right back.

16:13.799 --> 16:16.799
[cheers and applause]

16:23.399 --> 16:26.399
[jazz music]

16:26.399 --> 16:29.570
[cheers and applause]

16:29.570 --> 16:32.230
- Welcome back to
"Penn & Teller: Fool Us."

16:32.230 --> 16:35.269
Let's find out a little
about our next fooler.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.370
- Howdy, I'm Mac King.

16:41.370 --> 16:44.429
I'm a magician, comedian,
Las Vegan--

16:44.429 --> 16:46.230
probably the king
of Las Vegas, really.

16:46.230 --> 16:48.269
I have a magic show
at Harrah's Las Vegas,

16:48.269 --> 16:51.899
for the past 16 years--
way more than Penn

16:51.899 --> 16:53.669
and Teller have been at the Rio.

16:53.669 --> 16:56.169
I was on the show last year.
Guinea pig.

16:56.169 --> 16:57.970
Last year, I said,

16:57.970 --> 17:00.429
"If you fool Teller,
you've fooled Penn and Teller."

17:00.429 --> 17:03.370
- He should not say, "All
you have to do is fool Teller,"

17:03.370 --> 17:05.500
'cause this juggler

17:05.500 --> 17:08.900
is gonna bust
your Kentucky butt right now.

17:08.900 --> 17:10.269
- So this year, I thought, "Ah,

17:10.269 --> 17:12.329
you know, what can I say
to insult Teller?"

17:12.329 --> 17:14.269
His slight of hand

17:14.269 --> 17:17.569
is only matched
by his slight of stature.

17:17.569 --> 17:19.170
That's--that's
just kind of a lame joke.

17:19.170 --> 17:21.500
I can't think of anything mean
to say about Teller.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.000
He's so sweet and nice.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.130
So I'm gonna have to think
of some insult for Penn again.

17:26.130 --> 17:29.930
[cheers and applause]

17:29.930 --> 17:33.099
- Our next performer didn't fool
Penn and Teller last season,

17:33.099 --> 17:35.299
but he did manage
to tick them off.

17:35.299 --> 17:38.900
Please welcome
the always-likable Mac King.

17:38.900 --> 17:42.200
[cheers and applause]

17:42.200 --> 17:43.269
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

17:43.269 --> 17:46.400
- Hey, I am Mac King,

17:46.400 --> 17:48.099
and I guess, since I'm up here
in my new suit,

17:48.099 --> 17:49.900
we ought to get this show
on the road.

17:49.900 --> 17:53.930
I know this scares you.
I'm not doing that tonight.

17:53.930 --> 17:55.130
I know it would fool you,

17:55.130 --> 17:57.869
but--Alyson, come on over.
Come on over.

17:57.869 --> 17:59.400
Step right over here
on this side.

17:59.400 --> 18:00.470
Thanks for coming.

18:00.470 --> 18:02.799
- Sure.
- Come this way,

18:02.799 --> 18:04.470
just a little bit--yeah,
right up next to the suit.

18:04.470 --> 18:05.900
- Oh, all right.
- You and I, Alyson,

18:05.900 --> 18:07.269
and that piece of rope

18:07.269 --> 18:10.430
are going to do one of Houdini's
most famous tricks.

18:10.430 --> 18:15.200
Yeah, this is called
the Houdini Challenge

18:15.200 --> 18:19.369
Naked Rope Escape.

18:19.369 --> 18:21.099
- I just have to make
a couple calls.

18:21.099 --> 18:22.529
- No, I just--
this is good--

18:22.529 --> 18:24.500
the Houdini Challenge
Naked Rope Escape.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.400
I want you to take off
your clothes and tie me up.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.529
[laughter]

18:29.529 --> 18:30.930
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

18:30.930 --> 18:33.970
- Maybe you should ask Teller.
- Yeah, all right, Teller.

18:33.970 --> 18:35.930
No, we're gonna use--
if you put up with that,

18:35.930 --> 18:37.769
you get a big
goblet of vodka.

18:37.769 --> 18:39.670
Hold that with one hand,
if you would, Alyson.

18:39.670 --> 18:41.599
Just like that--that's perfect.
If you hold it like that,

18:41.599 --> 18:43.269
everybody can see
the water part really good.

18:43.269 --> 18:44.369
Don't drink that.

18:44.369 --> 18:45.900
So Alyson,
when you were a little girl,

18:45.900 --> 18:47.000
did you ever go fishing?

18:47.000 --> 18:48.069
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

18:48.069 --> 18:49.269
My grandpa used
to take me fishing,

18:49.269 --> 18:52.700
when I was a little girl.

18:52.700 --> 18:55.470
He said, in order to catch fish,
you have to have three things.

18:55.470 --> 18:57.599
You have to have
the proper fishing pole.

18:57.599 --> 18:59.670
This is my grandpa's
original fishing pole.

18:59.670 --> 19:01.299
- Aw.
- I know.

19:01.299 --> 19:03.569
You have to have a place to put
the fish once you catch 'em.

19:03.569 --> 19:05.130
That's what you're holding.
I'm gonna catch a fish,

19:05.130 --> 19:07.470
and I'm gonna drop him right
in that glass of water.

19:07.470 --> 19:09.900
The third thing that you have
to have to catch fish is,

19:09.900 --> 19:13.970
of course,
the proper bait...

19:13.970 --> 19:16.369
the Fig Newton.

19:16.369 --> 19:18.069
Yeah, you bust off
about a third of a cookie.

19:18.069 --> 19:20.970
That's all it takes--nice long,
squishy, skinny piece.

19:20.970 --> 19:22.299
You roll that squishy,

19:22.299 --> 19:24.470
skinny piece of squishy
Fig Newton up on the hook.

19:24.470 --> 19:26.529
Just roll it and squish it
on there. It'll stay.

19:26.529 --> 19:29.869
And with cookie as bait,
you can fish anywhere you want.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.000
- All right.
- You and I are fishing

19:31.000 --> 19:32.200
out here in midair,

19:32.200 --> 19:33.869
but we're not looking
for any fish.

19:33.869 --> 19:35.269
We're catching goldfish.

19:35.269 --> 19:36.799
There's a goldfish right
in front of Teller's head.

19:36.799 --> 19:38.829
See if I can snag that out of
the--oh, I got him!

19:38.829 --> 19:41.930
Oh, yeah.
He is a fighter.

19:41.930 --> 19:43.470
Hold that glass
over here, Alyson.

19:43.470 --> 19:45.170
- Okay, okay.
- And check him out.

19:45.170 --> 19:47.170
- Aww.

19:47.170 --> 19:49.400
[cheers and applause]

19:49.400 --> 19:51.630
Hi, buddy.

19:51.630 --> 19:54.200
That's so cool.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.670
Oh my gosh.

19:55.670 --> 19:57.200
- That's a dang
real fish.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.200
- Yeah, it is.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.529
[laughter]

19:59.529 --> 20:01.970
- Alyson, do you know
the rule here on "Fool Us?"

20:01.970 --> 20:03.299
- Uh...

20:03.299 --> 20:05.599
- Rule is, whatever you catch...
- Oh, please don't.

20:05.599 --> 20:06.869
Oh, God.

20:06.869 --> 20:08.170
- You gotta eat.
- Oh.

20:08.170 --> 20:11.369
[audience groaning]

20:11.369 --> 20:16.130
- No, he's still there.
He's still there.

20:16.130 --> 20:17.970
He's just a little scared now.

20:17.970 --> 20:19.269
- Yeah.

20:19.269 --> 20:20.829
- That's why
the water's kind of cloudy.

20:20.829 --> 20:21.869
- Me too.

20:21.869 --> 20:23.869
[laughter]

20:23.869 --> 20:25.769
- Hold that one just
like before--perfect.

20:25.769 --> 20:27.799
Now, I can't show you how to
catch fish out of the air.

20:27.799 --> 20:29.069
That's my grandpa's secret.

20:29.069 --> 20:31.869
But I can show you
how to freak out your friends.

20:31.869 --> 20:35.700
You need a carrot
and a carrot peeler.

20:35.700 --> 20:37.069
- You're kidding.
- This is how I pretended

20:37.069 --> 20:38.299
to eat a goldfish.
Here's what you do.

20:38.299 --> 20:40.329
You peel off
a big strip of carrot

20:40.329 --> 20:42.700
so it looks just
like a goldfish.

20:42.700 --> 20:45.500
Yeah, then you got to use
your teeth for this.

20:45.500 --> 20:46.970
- Okay.
- Don't worry. We'll use mine.

20:46.970 --> 20:48.369
- Okay, good.
- Actually,

20:48.369 --> 20:50.170
these used to be
my grandpa's too.

20:50.170 --> 20:52.529
- Oh, he's a nice guy.
[laughter]

20:52.529 --> 20:53.569
- Uh-huh,
he was a nice guy.

20:53.569 --> 20:56.200
- Yeah.
- So you trim it up

20:56.200 --> 20:58.569
using your rodent-like teeth,

20:58.569 --> 21:01.569
so it's vaguely--
- Aww.

21:01.569 --> 21:03.730
- Thank you--vaguely
goldfish-shaped.

21:03.730 --> 21:06.170
Now, pretend like
that glass of water

21:06.170 --> 21:07.930
is your friend's aquarium
and that there are

21:07.930 --> 21:10.369
a whole bunch of goldfish
swimming around inside.

21:10.369 --> 21:12.369
Here's what you do
to freak out your friends.

21:12.369 --> 21:14.799
Hold the carrot sliver
behind your fingers.

21:14.799 --> 21:16.470
Nobody knows that you have it.

21:16.470 --> 21:18.869
When you're ready, you reach
down amongst your friend's fish

21:18.869 --> 21:21.069
and pull out the carrot like
it's one of their goldfish.

21:21.069 --> 21:22.970
You go, "Ooh,
I got your goldfish."

21:22.970 --> 21:27.200
Don't say, "Ooh,
I got your carrot"--no good.

21:27.200 --> 21:28.230
Keep him a-wiggling.

21:28.230 --> 21:29.529
Before they
get a good look at it,

21:29.529 --> 21:33.069
you pop it in your mouth.

21:33.069 --> 21:34.099
- Ugh, okay.

21:34.099 --> 21:35.099
- And they think
that you ate the fish.

21:35.099 --> 21:37.730
- Ooh--ohh.
- Oh, Alyson.

21:37.730 --> 21:38.869
- What?
- Hold the glass over here.

21:38.869 --> 21:41.130
- Oh, God, no.

21:41.130 --> 21:42.730
Ahh-ha--ugh.

21:42.730 --> 21:47.369
[cheers and applause]

21:47.369 --> 21:49.470
- Thank you very much
for your help.

21:49.470 --> 21:50.930
- Mac King, everybody!

21:50.930 --> 21:52.029
[cheers and applause]

21:52.029 --> 21:53.569
Mac.

21:53.569 --> 21:56.799
Oh, all right,

21:56.799 --> 21:59.970
you traumatized me last time
you were on the show.

21:59.970 --> 22:02.670
- Well, how bout this time?
- This time as well.

22:02.670 --> 22:04.700
- That's my big goal.
- Ah, you're so--

22:04.700 --> 22:06.670
- You should
be traumatized, Alyson.

22:06.670 --> 22:07.730
- Yes.

22:07.730 --> 22:08.970
- Screw "Penn and Teller:
Fool Us."

22:08.970 --> 22:10.200
- Do pet stores even let you in
at this point?

22:10.200 --> 22:11.430
- Do pet stores let--no,

22:11.430 --> 22:12.769
I have to wear a disguise
to go into a pet store.

22:12.769 --> 22:15.829
- I would imagine.
- Yeah, guinea pigs, fish, yeah.

22:15.829 --> 22:19.029
- Ugh, yeah, he ate a guinea pig
last time he was on the show,

22:19.029 --> 22:20.829
if anybody didn't see it.
It was terrifying.

22:20.829 --> 22:22.769
- Yeah, that's all I do,
is eat small animals.

22:22.769 --> 22:25.269
- Oh, anyway, you're amazing.

22:25.269 --> 22:26.630
- Well, thank you very much.

22:26.630 --> 22:29.599
- And even seeing it as
a carrot, it's still disturbing.

22:29.599 --> 22:31.430
- Oh, yeah, thank you very much.
- Um, so--

22:31.430 --> 22:34.869
- If I can disturb one woman,
that's a good show, really.

22:34.869 --> 22:37.670
- Well, you've done your work.
I love it.

22:37.670 --> 22:39.130
- No, keep touching me.

22:39.130 --> 22:42.099
[laughter]

22:42.099 --> 22:43.900
- Um.
- Keep deliberating, boys.

22:43.900 --> 22:45.730
She's touching me.

22:45.730 --> 22:48.500
- I'm just looking
for the-the-the guinea pig.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.930
- Oh, it's a little lower.

22:49.930 --> 22:52.900
- Uh.
[laughter]

22:52.900 --> 22:54.569
All right.
Let's go to the guys.

22:54.569 --> 22:56.099
- They look like
they're done talking.

22:56.099 --> 22:57.470
- Oh, my goodness gracious.

22:57.470 --> 22:59.029
You know, you've been in Vegas

22:59.029 --> 23:03.069
almost as long as we have--
maybe a little longer.

23:03.069 --> 23:04.599
- Maybe.
- I think that--

23:04.599 --> 23:06.700
I may have said
this last time,

23:06.700 --> 23:08.000
but I think one thing Teller

23:08.000 --> 23:10.029
and I agree on is
that you are

23:10.029 --> 23:14.529
the greatest comedy magician
working in the world today.

23:14.529 --> 23:17.529
- Aww.
[cheers and applause]

23:20.529 --> 23:22.130
- Full stop.

23:22.130 --> 23:24.000
So since we said
that nice stuff about you,

23:24.000 --> 23:26.099
will you pretend we knew
how the trick was done?

23:26.099 --> 23:27.869
No, just--
[laughter]

23:27.869 --> 23:30.130
you know,
you threw this rope out,

23:30.130 --> 23:31.500
and you made that joke--which

23:31.500 --> 23:33.230
everybody
thought was a joke--that

23:33.230 --> 23:35.630
"You're relieved I didn't do
the rope trick."

23:35.630 --> 23:39.970
And you know that every single
time you do the rope trick,

23:39.970 --> 23:41.529
you fool Teller.

23:41.529 --> 23:43.930
He's never caught you
once doing that.

23:43.930 --> 23:44.930
If you had done this--

23:44.930 --> 23:46.269
- Uh, yeah, I--
I do know that,

23:46.269 --> 23:48.930
but it's not as interesting
as spitting a fish out.

23:48.930 --> 23:50.670
- No, it's--
- And so I'm like,

23:50.670 --> 23:53.029
"Well, should I come out
and try to fool 'em,

23:53.029 --> 23:55.099
or should I come out
and try to delight them?"

23:55.099 --> 23:56.430
And I was going with delight.

23:56.430 --> 23:58.299
- Aw.
- And you certainly did.

23:58.299 --> 23:59.500
It's the best version

23:59.500 --> 24:02.400
that's ever been done
of aerial fishing,

24:02.400 --> 24:06.599
and we absolutely love you,
Mac King, as a friend

24:06.599 --> 24:08.670
and as the greatest
comedy magician

24:08.670 --> 24:11.029
at least alive today,
maybe who ever lived.

24:11.029 --> 24:13.069
- Wow, what a compliment.

24:13.069 --> 24:15.069
You know, you didn't fool them,

24:15.069 --> 24:17.200
but you definitely
delighted us all.

24:17.200 --> 24:18.269
Thank you so much.

24:18.269 --> 24:19.369
- Thanks--oh, thank you.
- Mac King!

24:19.369 --> 24:20.930
- Mac King.
- I appreciate it, guys.

24:20.930 --> 24:23.200
Thank you so much.
- Mac King!

24:23.200 --> 24:24.529
- Thank you. Thank you.

24:24.529 --> 24:27.230
[cheers and applause]

24:27.230 --> 24:29.069
- Oh, wait.
- We'll be back in a moment

24:29.069 --> 24:31.369
with more incredible tricks,
free donuts,

24:31.369 --> 24:33.730
and a performance
by Penn and Teller.

24:33.730 --> 24:35.599
Two of those
three things are true.

24:35.599 --> 24:37.029
We'll be right back.

24:37.029 --> 24:40.029
[cheers and applause]

24:46.630 --> 24:49.630
[jazz music]

24:49.630 --> 24:52.369
[cheers and applause]

24:52.369 --> 24:53.769
- Welcome back.

24:53.769 --> 24:55.670
Let's find out if our next act

24:55.670 --> 24:58.369
has what it takes
to fool Penn and Teller.

25:01.569 --> 25:03.500
- I was born and raised
in California,

25:03.500 --> 25:06.500
grew up a block and a half
from the beach.

25:06.500 --> 25:10.829
The beach has given me a place
to let ideas connect.

25:10.829 --> 25:14.369
Creating new magic,
it's a pretty intensive process.

25:16.170 --> 25:19.569
I did my first paid magic show
when I was 11 years old.

25:19.569 --> 25:21.599
It was for a five-year-old's
birthday party,

25:21.599 --> 25:24.299
and I'm glad they booked it.
'Cause if they hadn't,

25:24.299 --> 25:26.869
I probably wouldn't be
sitting here right now.

25:26.869 --> 25:30.069
As I started doing more
mind-reading pieces, I realized,

25:30.069 --> 25:33.069
if you have somebody think
about somebody in their life

25:33.069 --> 25:35.230
who's important to them
and then can tell them

25:35.230 --> 25:36.670
what that person's name is,

25:36.670 --> 25:39.430
what that relationship is,
now you're entering their life.

25:39.430 --> 25:41.299
I love seeing rational people

25:41.299 --> 25:44.700
who cannot rationalize
what they just saw.

25:44.700 --> 25:48.230
[cheers and applause]

25:48.230 --> 25:52.099
- Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Kevin Viner.

25:52.099 --> 25:55.869
[cheers and applause]

25:55.869 --> 25:57.900
- Penn, Teller,
thank you so much

25:57.900 --> 25:59.670
for inviting me to perform
in your wonderful theater.

25:59.670 --> 26:01.230
It's a pleasure to be here.

26:01.230 --> 26:02.769
And I brought
a couple things for you.

26:02.769 --> 26:05.269
Penn, this'll be important
in a moment.

26:05.269 --> 26:06.700
This is a ball of paper.

26:06.700 --> 26:09.099
If you wouldn't mind
holding on to this, please.

26:09.099 --> 26:10.529
- I will.
- Thank you so much.

26:10.529 --> 26:12.470
- I wouldn't mind at all.
- And Tell, could I ask you

26:12.470 --> 26:13.970
to stand for a moment?

26:13.970 --> 26:17.569
I'd like you to sit on
this briefcase, if that's okay.

26:17.569 --> 26:20.130
Well, I modified it
a little bit for his comfort.

26:20.130 --> 26:22.630
So--yes?

26:22.630 --> 26:24.970
I figure, if I'm going to try
to fool you on your own stage,

26:24.970 --> 26:26.200
I should at least be polite.

26:26.200 --> 26:29.099
So Teller, thank you so much.

26:29.099 --> 26:31.670
If you would have
a seat--perfect.

26:40.970 --> 26:42.829
So in a moment, one of you

26:42.829 --> 26:46.329
will find yourself
on this stage with me.

26:46.329 --> 26:48.529
We need to do a little process
of elimination--

26:48.529 --> 26:51.730
if I could ask everybody
in the audience to please stand.

26:51.730 --> 26:54.900
Okay, so we have a full house
tonight--too many choices.

26:54.900 --> 26:56.869
Let's eliminate a few of you.

26:56.869 --> 26:59.900
So only stay standing
if you're somebody

26:59.900 --> 27:03.869
who knows your exact birthday.

27:03.869 --> 27:05.230
That should be most of you.

27:05.230 --> 27:07.430
But there's something
that most of you might not know,

27:07.430 --> 27:10.170
and that's the exact time
that you were born.

27:10.170 --> 27:12.900
So if you know the exact time,
to the minute,

27:12.900 --> 27:15.630
that you were born,
stay standing.

27:15.630 --> 27:18.200
Everyone else,
please have a seat.

27:20.369 --> 27:24.470
So we eliminated about
80% of the audience right now.

27:24.470 --> 27:26.829
Now, Penn and Teller, there's an
interesting cross section

27:26.829 --> 27:28.329
of people remaining, right?

27:28.329 --> 27:30.630
Because as you may know,
there are two types of people

27:30.630 --> 27:33.900
who typically know
the exact time they were born.

27:33.900 --> 27:36.029
There's your people
with amazing numerical recall.

27:36.029 --> 27:37.230
We tend to think of them

27:37.230 --> 27:39.329
as having higher-than-average
intelligence.

27:39.329 --> 27:41.130
And then people
who need that time

27:41.130 --> 27:43.430
to complete their
astrological charts,

27:43.430 --> 27:44.529
in which case we think of them

27:44.529 --> 27:48.269
as having
below-average intelligence.

27:48.269 --> 27:49.869
So Penn, I'll let you
decide who's who,

27:49.869 --> 27:51.200
but if you'd stand
for me, please.

27:51.200 --> 27:53.329
Penn, make eye contact
with somebody in the audience.

27:53.329 --> 27:55.269
Please get that paper ball
into their hands.

27:55.269 --> 27:57.430
We will use whoever you select.

28:00.900 --> 28:02.670
Miss, would you please
join me onstage?

28:02.670 --> 28:06.230
Give her a big round
of applause.

28:06.230 --> 28:08.069
Thank you so much.
What is your name?

28:08.069 --> 28:09.430
- Gianni.
- Gianni, I'm Kevin.

28:09.430 --> 28:10.900
It's a pleasure to meet you.

28:10.900 --> 28:12.769
So, Gianni,
you caught the paper ball.

28:12.769 --> 28:14.299
You didn't know that it would be
coming to you, right?

28:14.299 --> 28:15.529
- I did not.

28:15.529 --> 28:17.369
- If your birth date

28:17.369 --> 28:20.630
is printed inside
this paper ball,

28:20.630 --> 28:21.829
would that
blow you away?

28:21.829 --> 28:23.700
- Absolutely.
- Okay, now,

28:23.700 --> 28:26.769
I need you to
be honest with me.

28:26.769 --> 28:28.529
Do you see it there?

28:28.529 --> 28:30.200
- I do.
- Okay, I'd hope so.

28:30.200 --> 28:33.170
That's a calendar.
That's a calendar.

28:33.170 --> 28:34.970
Every date.

28:34.970 --> 28:38.700
[cheers and applause]

28:38.700 --> 28:40.529
Gianni, you knew the time
you were born.

28:40.529 --> 28:41.869
- I do.

28:41.869 --> 28:43.500
- And you know that
to the minute.

28:43.500 --> 28:45.670
- I do, yes.
- What's the hour, first

28:45.670 --> 28:47.670
of all--just the hour, Gianni?

28:47.670 --> 28:49.200
- 1:00--1:00 p.m.

28:49.200 --> 28:53.099
- 1:00--Gianni,

28:53.099 --> 28:56.329
you were born
at one what?

28:56.329 --> 29:01.799
- 35.
- 1:35.

29:01.799 --> 29:03.869
Gianni, was this a.m. or p.m.?

29:03.869 --> 29:08.269
- P.m.
- 1:35 p.m., Gianni,

29:08.269 --> 29:11.029
you came into this world.

29:11.029 --> 29:12.230
- Yes, I did.

29:12.230 --> 29:13.930
- Would you hold on to that
for a moment?

29:13.930 --> 29:15.029
- Yes.

29:15.029 --> 29:18.170
- There's about
a 1 in 1500 chance

29:18.170 --> 29:21.569
of throwing out
a random time--24 hours

29:21.569 --> 29:24.069
in a day, 60 minutes
in an hour--and

29:24.069 --> 29:28.470
getting that time exactly right.

29:28.470 --> 29:31.599
Teller, you've been sitting on
that briefcase the entire time.

29:31.599 --> 29:33.970
Would you please
bring it to me onstage?

29:33.970 --> 29:37.900
Give Teller a big
round of applause.

29:37.900 --> 29:40.099
[cheers and applause]

29:40.099 --> 29:43.470
Teller, thank you
very much, yes.

29:44.569 --> 29:46.529
[laughter]

29:46.529 --> 29:49.470
If we open the briefcase,

29:49.470 --> 29:53.029
can you describe
to everybody

29:53.029 --> 29:56.430
what it is
that you see inside?

29:56.430 --> 29:57.930
- Um, a navy bag.

29:57.930 --> 30:00.730
- A navy bag with
a drawstring there, right?

30:00.730 --> 30:01.730
- Yes.

30:01.730 --> 30:02.930
Yes, sorry,
a drawstring bag.

30:02.930 --> 30:05.000
- Gianni,
I brought you a gift--

30:05.000 --> 30:06.529
a souvenir.

30:06.529 --> 30:08.930
There's a saying you may have
heard--even a stopped clock

30:08.930 --> 30:10.799
is right twice a day.

30:10.799 --> 30:12.569
I sure hope this is
one of those times.

30:12.569 --> 30:15.170
Reach inside.
Take out what's in there.

30:15.170 --> 30:16.730
Yeah, grab that.
Pull it all the way out.

30:16.730 --> 30:20.500
- Okay.
- Oh my goodness.

30:20.500 --> 30:22.029
- This is a clock

30:22.029 --> 30:28.430
set to exactly 1:35 p.m.

30:28.430 --> 30:30.369
[cheers and applause]

30:30.369 --> 30:32.299
Gianni, thank you.
- Thank you very much.

30:32.299 --> 30:34.200
- Another round of applause
for Gianni.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.700
- Thank you, thank you.

30:35.700 --> 30:38.529
[cheers and applause]

30:38.529 --> 30:43.000
- Penn, Teller,
a souvenir for you.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.269
You may want to put
some batteries in it

30:44.269 --> 30:45.529
if you'd like to use it.

30:45.529 --> 30:47.230
Thank you both so much.

30:47.230 --> 30:49.529
[cheers and applause]

30:49.529 --> 30:52.630
- Kevin Viner, everyone.
That is fantastic.

30:52.630 --> 30:54.869
- Thank you, thank you.

30:54.869 --> 30:57.630
- Wow, and you're
letting them inspect it.

30:57.630 --> 31:00.730
- Of course.
- So you're a mentalist.

31:00.730 --> 31:01.970
Do I have to ask you questions,

31:01.970 --> 31:04.670
or do you know
what I'm thinking?

31:04.670 --> 31:05.869
- It depends.

31:05.869 --> 31:07.170
I mean, I'm pretty good
at reading people.

31:07.170 --> 31:08.299
It helps with women.
- Yeah?

31:08.299 --> 31:09.599
- Yeah.
- Yes?

31:09.599 --> 31:12.069
Does that mean you just are,
like, the perfect guy,

31:12.069 --> 31:13.529
because you always, like,

31:13.529 --> 31:15.329
"Oh, honey,
I see you need a foot rub,"

31:15.329 --> 31:16.900
and you just--
you're there?

31:16.900 --> 31:18.500
- Let's put it this way--yeah,
I mean, I'm the kind of guy

31:18.500 --> 31:20.000
I can pick out the dresses

31:20.000 --> 31:22.299
she wants before she knows
she's going to like them.

31:22.299 --> 31:25.369
- Oh, ladies, come on.
- Sorry, I'm taken,

31:25.369 --> 31:28.869
but there are more like me.
- That's fantastic.

31:28.869 --> 31:30.700
All right, so
do you get, like,

31:30.700 --> 31:33.299
weird requests
from audience members, or--

31:33.299 --> 31:35.000
- I do. It's--when you do
this line of work,

31:35.000 --> 31:36.230
you have people who ask,
you know,

31:36.230 --> 31:37.970
"Can you--can you
contact people?"

31:37.970 --> 31:40.730
And I--no, not at all.
No one can do that.

31:40.730 --> 31:42.970
So I try and veer away from--

31:42.970 --> 31:45.470
- Well, this time, we can
contact people.

31:45.470 --> 31:47.000
We're gonna contact
Penn and Teller.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.369
- Please.
- Oh, my goodness.

31:48.369 --> 31:50.230
- Boys.
- Thank you.

31:50.230 --> 31:52.599
[cheers and applause]

31:52.599 --> 31:55.269
Oh, you certainly know
how to suck up to us.

31:55.269 --> 31:57.230
Doing an
astrology-is-stupid joke

31:57.230 --> 31:59.569
right at the top,
you've got us in your pocket.

31:59.569 --> 32:01.430
- Good, thank you.
- We loved it right away.

32:01.430 --> 32:03.000
I love how much
of this is clean.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.099
I just love that you
had us select

32:05.099 --> 32:07.470
somebody--absolutely
clean selection,

32:07.470 --> 32:08.930
couldn't possibly be a plant.

32:08.930 --> 32:10.930
We also love the fact
that we end up

32:10.930 --> 32:12.230
with a cheap clock

32:12.230 --> 32:14.500
with no battery in it,
completely clean.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.630
You can look at this
till the cows come home,

32:16.630 --> 32:18.170
and you can't find anything.

32:18.170 --> 32:19.799
- Yes.
- So you are completely

32:19.799 --> 32:21.000
clean on the plant.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.700
You are completely
clean on the clock.

32:22.700 --> 32:24.170
It's a wonderful way to do it.

32:24.170 --> 32:27.099
You also found a way to do
a real miracle, which is,

32:27.099 --> 32:30.470
you made Teller taller than me
for a short period of time.

32:30.470 --> 32:33.099
- Yes it is.
[cheers and applause]

32:33.099 --> 32:34.799
- But all of that being said,

32:34.799 --> 32:36.269
in this case,

32:36.269 --> 32:38.529
we have a remote idea
how you did it.

32:38.529 --> 32:40.069
- Okay.

32:40.069 --> 32:42.569
I will say that you got it.

32:42.569 --> 32:44.500
- What?
A remote?

32:44.500 --> 32:46.099
- So you get that?
- I get that.

32:46.099 --> 32:47.529
I get that. They got it.

32:47.529 --> 32:50.369
- I'm not gonna get it,
but he got it, so thanks, Kevin.

32:50.369 --> 32:51.769
All right, thank you,
Kevin Viner!

32:51.769 --> 32:54.529
- Thank you so much.
[cheers and applause]

32:54.529 --> 32:56.200
Thank you.
- All right.

32:56.200 --> 32:57.599
[cheers and applause]

32:57.599 --> 33:00.230
Penn and Teller
get to clock out as judges

33:00.230 --> 33:02.170
and clock in as entertainers,

33:02.170 --> 33:04.369
when they perform
when we come back.

33:04.369 --> 33:05.369
Don't miss it.

33:05.369 --> 33:08.369
[cheers and applause]

33:13.630 --> 33:16.630
[jazz music]

33:16.630 --> 33:18.599
â™ª â™ª

33:18.599 --> 33:21.400
- You know you love them.
I know I love them.

33:21.400 --> 33:22.700
They know I love them.

33:22.700 --> 33:25.230
So while I'm here
with my good friend Teller,

33:25.230 --> 33:27.369
here's Penn.

33:27.369 --> 33:30.369
[cheers and applause]

33:41.200 --> 33:44.200
[cheers and applause]

33:52.130 --> 33:53.869
- Goodness gracious!

33:53.869 --> 33:55.930
[cheers and applause]

33:55.930 --> 33:58.569
Oh, man, you know,

33:58.569 --> 34:02.400
juggling fire always
gets a nice round of applause.

34:02.400 --> 34:04.200
Some people think
it's beautiful--you know,

34:04.200 --> 34:06.869
watch the torches move
through the air, and the sound.

34:06.869 --> 34:09.469
Some think it's difficult,
somehow more difficult,

34:09.469 --> 34:12.199
to juggle items that are ablaze.

34:12.199 --> 34:14.130
And still others think
it is dangerous.

34:14.130 --> 34:16.869
Whatever you're thinking--
whatever you're thinking,

34:16.869 --> 34:20.070
you're all hoping
the same thing.

34:20.070 --> 34:21.300
You're all hoping
that I'm gonna have

34:21.300 --> 34:24.699
an accident--a really bad one.

34:24.699 --> 34:27.500
And I am--the worst
accident possible

34:27.500 --> 34:28.900
when juggling torches.

34:28.900 --> 34:32.030
I'm gonna catch one
of the torches on the wrong

34:32.030 --> 34:35.630
end--that is to say,
the end that is on fire.

34:35.630 --> 34:38.869
The worst accident possible
when juggling torches

34:38.869 --> 34:42.900
is about to happen right now.

34:42.900 --> 34:44.400
Oh no, fire! Fire!

34:44.400 --> 34:45.670
Run, run! Fire!

34:45.670 --> 34:48.000
Save yourselves! Fire! Fire!

34:48.000 --> 34:49.869
Oh, no, fire! Fire!

34:49.869 --> 34:50.869
Fire!

34:50.869 --> 34:52.030
[fire extinguisher hisses]

34:53.469 --> 34:56.170
The worst accident possible

34:56.170 --> 34:58.199
when juggling
torches--I slightly

34:58.199 --> 35:01.769
soiled my right hand
with carbon.

35:01.769 --> 35:04.400
I also showed
my uncompromising commitment

35:04.400 --> 35:05.869
to the First Amendment

35:05.869 --> 35:08.170
to the Constitution
of the United States

35:08.170 --> 35:11.530
of American by being
willing to yell, "Fire!"

35:11.530 --> 35:13.199
in a crowded theater.

35:13.199 --> 35:14.530
[cheers and applause]

35:14.530 --> 35:17.170
Congress shall make no law!

35:17.170 --> 35:18.869
[cheers and applause]

35:18.869 --> 35:20.030
Now, since Penn and Teller

35:20.030 --> 35:22.769
are kind of into
that debunking thing,

35:22.769 --> 35:24.570
I thought I'd explain to you
how I was able

35:24.570 --> 35:27.469
to have the worst
accident possible

35:27.469 --> 35:30.730
when juggling torches and
come out virtually unscathed.

35:30.730 --> 35:35.630
What I did was, when I caught
the torch on the wrong end,

35:35.630 --> 35:38.670
I let go of it
almost right away.

35:38.670 --> 35:41.030
Now, I can't brag on myself
too much for this.

35:41.030 --> 35:43.929
It's a trait that I may share
with many of you.

35:43.929 --> 35:47.500
Even a cursory look at strict
Darwinism would tell you

35:47.500 --> 35:49.829
that we needn't wade
through a savannah somewhere

35:49.829 --> 35:52.599
in northern Africa
150,000 years ago

35:52.599 --> 35:55.429
for this particular trait
to be selected for.

35:55.429 --> 35:58.199
When you're dealing
with carbon-based life forms--

35:58.199 --> 36:00.070
that is to say, organic life--

36:00.070 --> 36:02.469
even at your earliest
multicellular level,

36:02.469 --> 36:05.070
those organisms
that grab onto fire

36:05.070 --> 36:08.630
and don't let go just aren't
gonna jump into the gene pool

36:08.630 --> 36:11.699
with the same
gusto of our real ancestors.

36:11.699 --> 36:15.030
So that kind of covers
the dangerous part of it.

36:15.030 --> 36:17.070
Now, as far as
the difficult part,

36:17.070 --> 36:19.269
these torches were
designed to be juggled.

36:19.269 --> 36:22.630
They were not designed to
harass Frankenstein's monster.

36:22.630 --> 36:26.769
But before Teller and I
had all the money necessary

36:26.769 --> 36:29.530
to bribe all the officials
necessary

36:29.530 --> 36:31.269
to be able to use open,

36:31.269 --> 36:33.670
unsupervised flame
in a theater with,

36:33.670 --> 36:35.630
in my opinion, too few exits,

36:35.630 --> 36:38.730
we used to play places
that had a bar

36:38.730 --> 36:40.400
right there in the room with us.

36:40.400 --> 36:42.570
And I would just
grab three bottles

36:42.570 --> 36:44.869
off the speed rack
and do a routine with those.

36:44.869 --> 36:48.929
Now, these bottles were not
designed to be juggled.

36:48.929 --> 36:52.670
These bottles were
designed to hold liquor

36:52.670 --> 36:55.429
in an attractive manner,

36:55.429 --> 36:57.199
unlike some of you.

36:57.199 --> 36:58.630
I want you to contrast the way

36:58.630 --> 37:00.099
these bottles move
through the air

37:00.099 --> 37:01.599
with the way the torches move.

37:01.599 --> 37:02.670
I don't know
if you can tell this,

37:02.670 --> 37:04.429
but they move much faster,

37:04.429 --> 37:06.869
and it's a less even turn.

37:06.869 --> 37:09.070
And although each of
the bottles moves

37:09.070 --> 37:10.730
differently from the torches,

37:10.730 --> 37:13.369
they also move very
differently from one another,

37:13.369 --> 37:14.800
because they're
different brands,

37:14.800 --> 37:16.400
even though we've taken
the labels

37:16.400 --> 37:18.599
off them here for legal reasons.

37:18.599 --> 37:20.570
But even though
it's much more difficult

37:20.570 --> 37:22.530
to juggle the bottles
than the torches,

37:22.530 --> 37:25.400
it gets no reaction whatsoever.

37:25.400 --> 37:26.929
That's because

37:26.929 --> 37:31.530
it's essentially
intellectual and not visceral.

37:31.530 --> 37:34.199
But that covers difficult.

37:34.199 --> 37:35.530
And this...

37:35.530 --> 37:37.699
[glass shatters]

37:37.699 --> 37:39.769
Is beautiful.

37:39.769 --> 37:40.969
Look at that, huh?

37:40.969 --> 37:43.570
Just fractal minus zero,
no limits.

37:43.570 --> 37:44.730
See that little thing
sticking up there?

37:44.730 --> 37:47.000
See that, Alyson,
Satan's little howdy-do?

37:47.000 --> 37:48.099
Is that talking to you?

37:48.099 --> 37:49.400
- Uhh, yeah.
- It's talking to me.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.599
- Mm-hmm.
- How 'bout right in your eye?

37:51.599 --> 37:53.130
Now, they all break
very different,

37:53.130 --> 37:55.429
because there's no way to
predict how they're gonna break.

37:55.429 --> 37:57.099
It's a nonlinear--

37:57.099 --> 37:58.530
[glass shatters]
Oh, yeah.

37:58.530 --> 37:59.699
Oh, yeah.

37:59.699 --> 38:02.800
You know,
I'm not that different from you.

38:02.800 --> 38:05.429
When I'm holding
a broken bottle in my hand,

38:05.429 --> 38:07.699
I have the same thought
in my head that you'd have,

38:07.699 --> 38:09.199
and that is, "Man,

38:09.199 --> 38:11.130
I wish Clay Aiken
were here."

38:11.130 --> 38:12.900
[growls, audience laughs]

38:12.900 --> 38:15.969
Now, these square ones--I don't
like to use these square ones,

38:15.969 --> 38:17.369
'cause they break
so erratically,

38:17.369 --> 38:18.429
but let me just give it a try.

38:18.429 --> 38:19.530
[glass shatters]

38:19.530 --> 38:21.329
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

38:21.329 --> 38:22.570
Look at that.
[inhales deeply]

38:22.570 --> 38:26.269
Now, you all know--
there's no secret

38:26.269 --> 38:28.469
to this--I'm gonna juggle these.
That's the punch line.

38:28.469 --> 38:31.869
But I do want to say ahead
of time that I do sometimes,

38:31.869 --> 38:33.969
you know,
get injured during this.

38:33.969 --> 38:35.969
But it's only a slight cut.
It's not like, you know,

38:35.969 --> 38:38.300
Roy getting his head bit off
by a tiger, you know?

38:38.300 --> 38:41.170
It's not--they're not gonna be
on, like, CNN talking about it.

38:41.170 --> 38:42.969
You know, it's--but it's a cut
that will--and

38:42.969 --> 38:45.099
I also want to say, you know,
we do have a lot of children

38:45.099 --> 38:46.269
that watch this show.

38:46.269 --> 38:47.369
And I got to say--
and the children,

38:47.369 --> 38:48.699
I don't think you're stupid.

38:48.699 --> 38:50.000
I don't think you're--
I know you know this,

38:50.000 --> 38:51.269
but I got to say this,

38:51.269 --> 38:53.300
because parents watching
with you want me to say it.

38:53.300 --> 38:55.329
And that's to say,
the stuff we do on this show

38:55.329 --> 38:56.800
is very dangerous.

38:56.800 --> 38:58.469
You shouldn't try any of it.

38:58.469 --> 38:59.900
I don't even know
what I mean by that.

38:59.900 --> 39:02.599
I guess I mean, "Kids,
when you're at the bar,

39:02.599 --> 39:04.170
"don't grab three bottles,
smash 'em,

39:04.170 --> 39:06.000
"and try to juggle 'em--

39:06.000 --> 39:08.429
"not unless there's
a lot of money riding on it

39:08.429 --> 39:10.699
"or it's a double-dog dare,

39:10.699 --> 39:14.099
"which you must not
turn down ever,

39:14.099 --> 39:15.230
unless you're a chicken."

39:15.230 --> 39:18.329
Also, you might notice that,

39:18.329 --> 39:20.000
because we're a television show,

39:20.000 --> 39:23.929
there's no--there's no obscenity
in the show at all.

39:23.929 --> 39:27.929
And I--I just want to say,
from experience that,

39:27.929 --> 39:29.599
if I'm injured,

39:29.599 --> 39:33.300
that whole no-obscenity thing--
right out the window.

39:33.300 --> 39:35.730
As a matter of fact, if I'm cut
even slightly tonight,

39:35.730 --> 39:38.570
I'm going to take you
all on a scatological

39:38.570 --> 39:43.469
sexual white-knuckle ride
through the Old Testament.

39:43.469 --> 39:46.699
I'll be covering the violent
nonconsensual sex acts

39:46.699 --> 39:49.230
of Deuteronomy 14-27

39:49.230 --> 39:51.969
and detailing those acts
in the graphic street language

39:51.969 --> 39:54.269
of the late
but still great Tupac Shakur.

39:54.269 --> 39:55.929
So just--that's only--that's

39:55.929 --> 39:57.500
only--I'm gonna step
behind here.

39:57.500 --> 39:59.900
So this protects--
little pieces of glass

39:59.900 --> 40:02.099
will still fly off
as I'm doing this,

40:02.099 --> 40:04.170
and this stop stem
from bouncing off

40:04.170 --> 40:06.329
and running out
and hitting a cameraman.

40:06.329 --> 40:09.130
But they do bounce off
and come straight in my face

40:09.130 --> 40:11.000
for your entertainment pleasure.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.869
Now, what you're watching here
is a physical improvisation.

40:13.869 --> 40:16.630
I've obviously never juggled
these exact bottles before,

40:16.630 --> 40:18.170
so I have to get a feel for 'em.

40:18.170 --> 40:20.670
I'm learning the trick right in
front of you, is what I'm doing.

40:20.670 --> 40:22.929
And--there we go--getting
a sense of each of these,

40:22.929 --> 40:25.070
so I can--I can juggle them.

40:25.070 --> 40:26.199
And I want to get a--

40:26.199 --> 40:27.199
Whoa!

40:27.199 --> 40:28.230
Oh, man.

40:28.230 --> 40:31.130
Whoa, you know,
I want to talk to you

40:31.130 --> 40:33.429
about what kind of actor
I am, Alyson,

40:33.429 --> 40:36.400
because every night,
I take the third bottle,

40:36.400 --> 40:38.070
throw it in the air,
and I go, like, "Whoa!"

40:38.070 --> 40:39.530
and try to pretend
it's a hard bottle,

40:39.530 --> 40:42.599
bring a little bit of drama
into a predictable piece.

40:42.599 --> 40:44.699
But tonight, it really
is a hard bottle.

40:44.699 --> 40:46.530
[laughter]

40:46.530 --> 40:49.369
But you'll be able to tell this
is a hard bottle by the fact

40:49.369 --> 40:50.800
this is probably
a little briefer

40:50.800 --> 40:53.070
than you think it should be.

40:53.070 --> 40:55.699
Man, yeah,
this could be the night

40:55.699 --> 40:58.099
that I--you could hear
a lot of swearing

40:58.099 --> 40:59.699
coming up real soon.

40:59.699 --> 41:01.099
[laughter]

41:06.030 --> 41:10.869
[cheers and applause]

41:10.869 --> 41:12.400
That's it!

41:12.400 --> 41:13.969
Beautiful, difficult,
and...

41:13.969 --> 41:16.500
[glass shatters]
Dangerous.

41:16.500 --> 41:20.530
[cheers and applause]

41:20.530 --> 41:24.030
- You're good?
Oh, all right.

41:24.030 --> 41:25.170
Thanks for watching.

41:25.170 --> 41:27.730
Join us again next week,
here in Las Vegas,

41:27.730 --> 41:29.570
with a new batch of magicians

41:29.570 --> 41:32.030
and, of course,
Penn and Teller.

41:32.030 --> 41:33.170
Good night!

41:33.170 --> 41:36.170
[cheers and applause]
