00:04.649 --> 00:08.518
Lord, we come to you, humbly
asking for your protection.

00:08.519 --> 00:10.587
I had a lot of faith in my father.

00:10.588 --> 00:13.828
He was like God to us.

00:13.872 --> 00:19.772
He nurtured us kids in the Bible,
and he nurtured us as a father.

00:22.147 --> 00:26.377
I knew that it was
something in the house.

00:26.378 --> 00:32.278
It resented my dad's faith and
his strength in his religion.

00:32.646 --> 00:35.315
When the day of evil comes...

00:35.316 --> 00:36.802
Stand your ground.

00:36.803 --> 00:38.930
It is a Demon.

00:38.931 --> 00:42.111
It feeds on your fear.

00:54.947 --> 00:57.949
Trust in the Lord with all thine heart.

00:57.950 --> 01:00.952
Lean not into thine own understanding.

01:00.953 --> 01:06.853
In all thy ways, acknowledge him,
and he shall direct thy paths.

01:07.770 --> 01:10.428
God, forgive us our sins
and protect us from evil.

01:10.429 --> 01:16.034
It was very exciting moving into the new
house for me and my twin sister, Lisa.

01:16.035 --> 01:17.735
Please watch over our family.

01:17.736 --> 01:23.636
I felt very happy to be in a
new neighborhood, in a new house.

01:24.310 --> 01:28.210
And I had, you know, high hopes.

01:29.482 --> 01:32.617
My father was like God to us.

01:32.618 --> 01:38.518
That's how we came to understand
God, was through watching our father.

01:38.724 --> 01:41.493
I really idolized my dad.

01:41.494 --> 01:44.974
Dad exuded joy, happiness...

01:45.163 --> 01:47.165
Positive thinking.

01:47.166 --> 01:50.635
And protect us from the wiles of the
Devil and the evil that surrounds...

01:50.636 --> 01:55.342
Roger, my husband, felt that God
was calling him to return to Kokomo,

01:55.343 --> 01:59.811
to work in the church
and to be near his family.

01:59.812 --> 02:01.779
God bless our house.

02:01.780 --> 02:02.847
Amen.

02:02.848 --> 02:04.768
Amen.

02:07.653 --> 02:11.155
My dad was gonna take a
job working in a church.

02:11.156 --> 02:14.833
And he was gonna be running
their Sunday School Department.

02:14.834 --> 02:20.734
He had brought a lot of his
Seminary books home from college.

02:21.133 --> 02:26.293
They covered every inch
of the Bible, every verse.

02:26.839 --> 02:30.227
The books held such a
high value to my dad,

02:30.228 --> 02:34.875
he had wanted to build a
bookshelf for those books.

02:34.876 --> 02:36.796
Damn.

02:37.049 --> 02:40.084
The bookcases were too tall.

02:40.085 --> 02:44.225
He could not get those bookcases in.

02:44.657 --> 02:48.137
Hand me that hammer, James.

02:48.682 --> 02:51.456
My dad was hammering...

02:51.457 --> 02:53.557
Pushing.

02:59.101 --> 03:03.901
It took all night to
get those bookcases in.

03:05.911 --> 03:08.979
- Good night, dad.
- Good night, dad.

03:08.980 --> 03:11.800
Good night, girls.

03:23.529 --> 03:26.848
The next day, I went into the kitchen...

03:26.849 --> 03:30.029
And was washing dishes.

03:30.303 --> 03:33.723
I was alone in the house.

03:39.111 --> 03:44.811
I heard a very strange noise
coming from the living room.

03:49.588 --> 03:53.668
One of the books was hanging
halfway off the bookshelf,

03:53.669 --> 03:57.749
about ready to fall onto the floor.

04:13.546 --> 04:17.206
This was a thick, heavy book.

04:23.370 --> 04:28.950
There was no reason for that
book to be off the shelf.

04:38.371 --> 04:40.204
It was summertime.

04:40.205 --> 04:45.245
In Indiana, it can get
up to about 100 degrees.

04:46.245 --> 04:49.395
Summers in Indiana are hot...

04:49.396 --> 04:52.156
Very warm, humid.

04:54.466 --> 04:58.846
I was on the top bunk, and I woke up.

05:03.866 --> 05:07.526
And it felt cold in my room.

05:08.667 --> 05:12.507
I noticed something on the wall.

05:21.146 --> 05:23.066
Lana.

05:24.049 --> 05:26.384
Lana, come look at this.

05:26.385 --> 05:28.845
Lana, get up, get up.

05:28.846 --> 05:30.588
What is it?

05:30.589 --> 05:34.009
Look what's on your wall.

05:48.273 --> 05:50.673
What is it?

05:54.146 --> 05:56.815
It seemed unreal.

05:56.816 --> 06:01.486
It looked like snowflakes,
little snowflakes.

06:01.487 --> 06:03.947
It was June.

06:04.156 --> 06:09.136
There should not be
frost on the wall in June.

06:10.998 --> 06:13.398
Go get mom.

06:29.526 --> 06:35.406
There was no wet or ice or
anything whatsoever on the wall.

06:35.988 --> 06:38.656
And the frost was gone.

06:38.657 --> 06:41.125
Didn't know where it went.

06:41.126 --> 06:43.706
It disappeared.

06:48.433 --> 06:54.038
One afternoon, I was sitting
in the living room, studying.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.859
Lisa was with me.

06:58.143 --> 07:02.529
And James came in the door
wearing her roller skates.

07:02.530 --> 07:04.931
Without her permission...

07:04.932 --> 07:08.592
White skates with pink wheels.

07:09.054 --> 07:12.423
Hey, you, get 'em
off. They're my skates.

07:12.424 --> 07:17.404
I demanded that he take
those girly skates off.

07:17.593 --> 07:20.999
And they were special to me.
They were a birthday present.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.980
She was mad at me. She
wanted her skates back.

07:26.906 --> 07:29.073
What's that?

07:29.074 --> 07:34.714
I heard the most deathly moan
that I could ever imagine.

07:36.248 --> 07:39.908
It came from under the floor.

07:42.888 --> 07:45.468
The moan grew.

07:45.492 --> 07:48.612
It vibrated the floor.

07:49.052 --> 07:51.395
It was a voice.

07:51.396 --> 07:56.496
And that's what was shaking
underneath our house.

07:56.902 --> 08:00.082
This was no earthquake.

08:05.335 --> 08:07.675
It stopped.

08:12.793 --> 08:17.233
I felt like something was gonna hurt us.

08:19.866 --> 08:23.394
I didn't know what to do except...

08:23.395 --> 08:25.975
Panic and run.

08:36.942 --> 08:41.212
We would not go back in the
house until my parents came home.

08:41.212 --> 08:42.943
We were too scared.

08:42.943 --> 08:46.484
They're here. They're here.

08:46.852 --> 08:51.173
And all of us kids, we're
still, you know, shuddering.

08:51.174 --> 08:52.223
What's going on?

08:52.224 --> 08:57.662
They were shaking. They were scared. I
could tell something had frightened them.

08:57.663 --> 08:59.530
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.

08:59.531 --> 09:00.732
What happened?

09:00.733 --> 09:03.598
There was a really loud growling noise.

09:03.599 --> 09:06.468
Come on. We'll go back in
the house. Come on. Let's go.

09:06.469 --> 09:08.740
I'll check first.

09:08.741 --> 09:13.277
I didn't want to approach the door.
I didn't want to go in the house.

09:13.278 --> 09:16.098
It was too scary.

09:37.169 --> 09:40.709
I needed him to believe me.

09:42.274 --> 09:43.466
It's all clear.

09:43.467 --> 09:47.545
It was probably just an
animal or a truck backfiring.

09:47.546 --> 09:51.446
And he tried to explain it away.

09:59.825 --> 10:02.894
Yes, Lisa, what is it?

10:02.895 --> 10:05.715
Please believe me.

10:06.135 --> 10:08.895
Go to bed, Lisa.

10:08.964 --> 10:11.784
It wouldn't work.

10:11.815 --> 10:16.375
He just dismissed
everything that happened.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.528
That night, I went to bed.

10:37.529 --> 10:40.709
I was trying to sleep.

10:44.524 --> 10:48.184
I heard this scratching noise.

10:51.910 --> 10:56.830
It was coming from the
glass, from the window.

11:02.342 --> 11:07.322
I thought the scratching
noise might be a bush.

11:07.648 --> 11:13.108
Maybe a cable wire hanging
off the side of the house.

11:41.263 --> 11:42.969
I saw...

11:42.970 --> 11:45.910
This hideous face...

11:46.218 --> 11:49.639
Like it was going to
come through the glass.

11:49.640 --> 11:51.860
Dad! Dad!

11:53.258 --> 11:56.618
Lana just couldn't speak.

11:57.062 --> 11:59.616
I couldn't say anything.
I couldn't breathe.

11:59.617 --> 12:02.033
What is it? What is it?
What happened? What happened?

12:02.034 --> 12:05.094
My father looked out.

12:10.511 --> 12:13.751
There was nothing there.

12:17.107 --> 12:21.888
Dad thought that this could be
a perv or something like that.

12:21.889 --> 12:26.149
And he was very fearful for us girls.

12:27.346 --> 12:32.449
We thought, because they
were young girls maybe um...

12:32.450 --> 12:37.310
Someone was watching
them, like a Peeping Tom.

12:41.827 --> 12:47.727
There were no footprints, no sign
of anyone being in the backyard.

12:48.600 --> 12:53.104
I was frustrated. I
felt like, I'm watched.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.973
Somebody's trying to hurt me.

12:54.974 --> 12:59.474
Somebody's trying to
possibly violate me.

13:00.312 --> 13:03.492
And I can't prove it.

13:08.988 --> 13:13.657
The day that Lisa and I got
Baptized was a very special day.

13:13.658 --> 13:17.498
We were a devout Baptist family.

13:18.830 --> 13:23.449
You need to be Baptized in order
to show the church of your faith.

13:23.450 --> 13:25.309
That you gave yourself over.

13:25.310 --> 13:29.930
So we followed through
with that tradition.

13:30.818 --> 13:32.676
This is Lisa.

13:32.677 --> 13:36.060
Lisa, do you profess your
faith in Christ as your savior?

13:36.061 --> 13:40.785
I was crying because it was
my babies getting Baptized.

13:40.786 --> 13:44.822
This baptism symbolizes your faith in
Christ and your choice to follow him.

13:44.823 --> 13:47.039
I felt exuberant.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.961
I felt excited and brilliant.

13:49.962 --> 13:55.139
I baptize you in the name of the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

13:55.140 --> 13:58.200
And he put me under.

14:06.445 --> 14:10.448
And then I entered into the water.

14:10.449 --> 14:16.149
Lana, do you profess your
faith in Christ as your savior?

14:28.133 --> 14:34.033
The sermon ended, and all of us
kids packed ourselves into the car.

14:34.306 --> 14:36.444
We were all in a good mood.

14:36.445 --> 14:39.985
We were planning our dinner.

14:49.388 --> 14:53.734
And the door would not move.
We could not get into the house.

14:53.735 --> 14:57.044
And I'm watching my dad,
who was a pretty big man...

14:57.045 --> 14:59.685
Push that door.

15:00.519 --> 15:02.467
Push it hard.

15:02.468 --> 15:08.048
I'm thinking he's gonna
break the door off the hinges.

15:13.879 --> 15:15.046
It won't open.

15:15.047 --> 15:19.307
Something large was blocking that door.

15:20.652 --> 15:24.817
He asked my brother to go
around the back of the house...

15:24.818 --> 15:26.518
James, go around the back.

15:26.519 --> 15:32.419
See if he couldn't climb in the
back window and open the front door.

15:36.768 --> 15:41.231
He pried on one of those panes of glass.

15:41.232 --> 15:45.012
Just enough to open the window.

15:53.985 --> 15:58.125
And I remember thinking, it's quiet.

15:58.190 --> 16:00.170
James?

16:08.833 --> 16:12.733
Why isn't he at the front door?

16:14.906 --> 16:17.426
Come on, son.

16:26.385 --> 16:29.936
I found the bookcase
laying in front of the door.

16:29.937 --> 16:33.957
As if it was barricading the door.

16:47.806 --> 16:53.706
The first reaction was that someone
had broken in and robbed our house.

17:00.051 --> 17:05.951
What was bizarre about this was, it
was only the bookcase that was affected.

17:09.060 --> 17:13.247
These bookcases had to
have been lifted up...

17:13.248 --> 17:16.667
And flown across the room.

17:21.339 --> 17:24.460
We were all in shock.

17:27.846 --> 17:30.486
Dad? Dad, look.

17:53.853 --> 17:55.713
Dad?

17:56.089 --> 17:58.369
Dad, look.

18:01.561 --> 18:07.081
My father's Bible commentaries
were piled on the floor.

18:13.106 --> 18:17.942
These books, books that he
based his spirituality on...

18:17.943 --> 18:20.763
And his faith on.

18:21.648 --> 18:23.816
There's no way that it was an intruder.

18:23.817 --> 18:27.717
And I knew that it had to be...

18:27.897 --> 18:30.477
Something else.

18:30.590 --> 18:35.181
Whatever it was, it resented
my dad's faith and...

18:35.182 --> 18:39.082
And his strength in his religion.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.920
I noticed him shaking.

18:53.513 --> 18:59.413
It was a very frightening moment
for me to see him that way.

19:17.336 --> 19:21.656
Dad tried to act like nothing happened.

19:22.974 --> 19:26.754
This is really freaking me out.

19:27.213 --> 19:29.848
This is real, isn't it?

19:29.849 --> 19:33.809
- Dad whipped around...
- No more!

19:42.595 --> 19:45.919
I don't want to hear
you talking about this.

19:45.920 --> 19:48.560
It is a Demon.

19:49.836 --> 19:53.316
And it feeds on your fear.

19:54.874 --> 19:57.754
He, my protector...

19:58.441 --> 20:01.402
Was finally acknowledging...

20:01.403 --> 20:04.334
That this was a Demon in our house.

20:04.335 --> 20:06.118
Do you hear me?

20:06.119 --> 20:09.419
I said, do you hear me?

20:10.190 --> 20:13.430
My dad couldn't deny...

20:13.826 --> 20:17.906
That something was going on anymore.

20:17.911 --> 20:22.824
I knew now that all of the things
the kids had been telling me.

20:22.825 --> 20:25.771
They hadn't made it
up; It was really true.

20:25.772 --> 20:29.732
Something was taking over my home.

20:37.683 --> 20:43.188
We were very low-income, and we
just could not pick up and leave.

20:43.189 --> 20:45.949
We had no money.

20:46.259 --> 20:50.519
My father came to the decision that...

20:50.587 --> 20:53.832
He needed to do something.

20:53.833 --> 20:56.701
He decided he was going
to have the house blessed.

20:56.702 --> 21:02.602
In the name of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Spirit...

21:02.670 --> 21:07.345
So he called over a
preacher from our church.

21:07.346 --> 21:11.850
Seek to make this home, before
all else, a dwelling place of love.

21:11.851 --> 21:13.748
He was gonna go from room to room,

21:13.749 --> 21:16.969
and he was gonna read from
passages out of the Bible.

21:16.970 --> 21:20.625
I've completed the blessing. Now
let's share a prayer together.

21:20.626 --> 21:23.806
And as a family, we...

21:24.353 --> 21:27.071
Bowed our heads and prayed.

21:27.072 --> 21:31.151
Our father in heaven,
hallowed be your name.

21:31.152 --> 21:36.909
I felt very hopeful that this was
helping us and that it would end it.

21:36.910 --> 21:39.550
- Amen.
- Amen.

21:44.117 --> 21:49.142
For the first couple of days, I
felt like, everything's normal.

21:49.143 --> 21:52.503
And there's nothing here.

22:02.035 --> 22:05.037
There was one day that I was sick.

22:05.038 --> 22:10.618
My sisters, they all went
to school, and I stayed home.

22:21.436 --> 22:26.356
It sounded like footsteps
walking in the attic.

22:30.239 --> 22:34.559
It was one after another after another.

22:41.107 --> 22:44.227
It was a heavy sound.

22:58.925 --> 23:04.184
There was nobody in the
house, and it was just me.

23:04.185 --> 23:08.805
There was something
else making that sound.

23:45.538 --> 23:49.078
And I couldn't see anybody.

24:13.929 --> 24:14.929
Calm down.

24:14.930 --> 24:18.626
James called me at work,
and he was very excited.

24:18.627 --> 24:20.221
I'll be there as soon as I can.

24:20.222 --> 24:22.802
He was scared.

24:22.925 --> 24:27.065
I felt threatened and very terrified.

24:34.267 --> 24:38.107
James was crying. He was scared.

24:50.116 --> 24:52.617
We were waiting, anxiously.

24:52.618 --> 24:57.298
And this was... this
was unsettling for me.

24:58.091 --> 25:01.991
My husband went up to the attic.

25:21.305 --> 25:24.545
There was nothing there.

25:26.310 --> 25:28.744
There was something there.

25:28.745 --> 25:31.963
My dad, he was shocked.

25:31.964 --> 25:35.924
And baffled, unable to explain it.

25:49.032 --> 25:53.529
Bringing a preacher in the
house, I believe, just...

25:53.530 --> 25:57.490
Escalated everything we tried to...

25:57.799 --> 25:59.719
Stop.

26:02.645 --> 26:06.450
I'd come home from school
and walk in the door,

26:06.451 --> 26:09.827
and the first thing that hit me was...

26:09.828 --> 26:12.528
This heaviness...

26:24.968 --> 26:28.868
Something so heavy about the air.

26:30.807 --> 26:33.987
It was very oppressive.

26:51.694 --> 26:56.854
I remember coming out of
my bedroom one morning...

26:59.836 --> 27:03.136
When I heard this sound.

27:03.606 --> 27:07.743
I remember looking up at the ceiling.

27:07.744 --> 27:11.703
I was in my bedroom, and
we heard James shouting.

27:11.704 --> 27:15.004
Lisa, come look at this.

27:21.324 --> 27:23.664
Lana. Lana!

27:32.102 --> 27:34.957
Those scissors were stuck,

27:34.958 --> 27:40.858
right above the area where my dad would
sit and read his Bible every morning.

27:43.958 --> 27:48.149
It's not possible to throw a pair
of scissors up and both prongs stick,

27:48.150 --> 27:51.270
dead into the ceiling.

27:51.388 --> 27:56.730
If those scissors could be thrown
with that kind of force by something.

27:56.731 --> 28:00.451
It could also throw it at us.

28:03.402 --> 28:07.002
And he shall direct thy path.

28:07.003 --> 28:11.073
God forgive us our sins
and protect us from evil.

28:11.074 --> 28:13.061
My dad was sitting there...

28:13.062 --> 28:15.478
Please watch over our family.

28:15.479 --> 28:17.813
Reading his Bible.

28:17.814 --> 28:21.183
Protect us from the wiles
of the Devil and the evil...

28:21.184 --> 28:25.504
Trust in the Lord with all my heart...

28:28.592 --> 28:31.952
And I heard this noise...

28:32.929 --> 28:35.869
This thumping noise.

28:36.366 --> 28:39.034
Thump, thump, thump.

28:39.035 --> 28:41.170
He shall...

28:41.171 --> 28:42.789
Thump, thump, thump.

28:42.790 --> 28:44.873
Trust in the Lord with all thine heart.

28:44.874 --> 28:49.074
Lean not into thine own understanding.

28:54.817 --> 28:56.677
Dad!

29:01.024 --> 29:06.924
The first thing that came to my
head was, my dad has been killed.

29:11.568 --> 29:13.428
Dad?

29:13.436 --> 29:15.296
Dad?

29:17.707 --> 29:19.567
Dad!

29:23.513 --> 29:26.333
He wasn't moving.

29:31.921 --> 29:33.781
Dad?

29:34.733 --> 29:36.593
Dad!

29:53.818 --> 29:57.298
Dad was completely bleeding.

29:58.081 --> 30:01.141
His face was scraped.

30:03.168 --> 30:06.108
He was really hurt.

30:07.129 --> 30:11.527
I thought that something
evil wanted to hurt my dad.

30:11.528 --> 30:14.828
My dad was under attack.

30:30.282 --> 30:33.627
Submit yourselves therefore to God.

30:33.628 --> 30:37.718
Resist the Devil, and
he will flee from you.

30:37.719 --> 30:40.991
Then to the evil spirit
in the house, he said,

30:40.992 --> 30:45.912
as a child of God, get
thee behind me, Satan.

30:46.175 --> 30:49.780
I knew what my dad was thinking.

30:49.781 --> 30:52.661
His faith taught...

30:52.878 --> 30:54.918
That...

30:57.807 --> 31:00.423
This kind of activity was demonic.

31:00.424 --> 31:03.115
For our struggle is not
against flesh and blood.

31:03.116 --> 31:06.247
You're led to believe...

31:06.248 --> 31:09.121
Church is gonna provide all the answers.

31:09.122 --> 31:11.880
Therefore, put on the full armor of God.

31:11.881 --> 31:14.259
God's gonna provide all the answers.

31:14.260 --> 31:17.963
The Bible will provide all the answers.

31:17.964 --> 31:19.591
It doesn't.

31:19.592 --> 31:24.104
So that when the day of evil comes,
you may be able to stand your ground.

31:24.105 --> 31:29.385
And it was sad seeing him
come to that realization.

31:30.843 --> 31:35.406
Take the helmet of salvation
and the sword of the spirit,

31:35.407 --> 31:38.827
which is the word of God.

31:40.820 --> 31:43.460
- Amen.
- Amen.

31:53.699 --> 31:56.368
Lord, father in heaven...

31:56.369 --> 32:01.740
We couldn't get the answers
about what was happening.

32:01.741 --> 32:04.776
We come to you, humbly
asking for your protection.

32:04.777 --> 32:08.137
My father's answer was...

32:08.274 --> 32:11.394
To continue to pray...

32:12.098 --> 32:14.518
For protection.

32:14.519 --> 32:16.421
Amen.

32:16.422 --> 32:18.342
Amen.

32:25.598 --> 32:29.078
That night, I went to bed.

32:30.323 --> 32:34.343
It was about 3:00 in the morning.

32:45.234 --> 32:48.174
It sounded familiar.

32:48.888 --> 32:52.908
It sounded like my father's knock.

33:12.866 --> 33:16.106
There was nothing there.

33:28.595 --> 33:31.175
It came again.

33:39.821 --> 33:43.541
I did go out into the hall...

33:44.805 --> 33:48.345
To see if anyone was there.

34:05.365 --> 34:10.165
The house was quiet,
and everyone was asleep.

34:16.592 --> 34:20.492
I was scared and believed that...

34:21.973 --> 34:25.632
Something was playing with me.

34:45.255 --> 34:48.614
Then I went back to bed.

35:03.256 --> 35:05.090
I woke up.

35:05.091 --> 35:09.051
I was turned away from my window.

35:09.596 --> 35:12.776
I could hear footsteps.

35:14.810 --> 35:19.010
Softly on the carpet going like this.

35:31.784 --> 35:33.753
I was terrified.

35:33.754 --> 35:36.634
Something's coming.

35:37.775 --> 35:41.015
I was on the top bunk.

35:41.994 --> 35:43.995
I felt her fear.

35:43.996 --> 35:47.776
That's when I started to pray.

35:55.241 --> 35:59.778
Listened to it as it
slowly approached my head.

35:59.779 --> 36:03.181
God is here. God is our protector.

36:03.182 --> 36:05.450
God is here. God is our protector.

36:05.451 --> 36:07.349
Closer and closer.

36:07.350 --> 36:09.653
God is here.

36:09.654 --> 36:12.654
And then it stopped.

36:42.655 --> 36:46.495
Its teeth, like animals' teeth...

36:48.395 --> 36:50.261
It suffocated me.

36:50.262 --> 36:53.142
I couldn't scream.

36:55.346 --> 37:00.566
I wanted to jump down
there so bad to help her...

37:00.847 --> 37:03.095
But I couldn't jump out of my bed.

37:03.096 --> 37:05.616
I was frozen.

38:06.993 --> 38:11.092
And then I realized
Sam wasn't in the room.

38:11.093 --> 38:13.261
- He was gone.
- Stay here.

38:13.262 --> 38:17.954
The first thing I thought
was that he's out there.

38:17.955 --> 38:20.415
Slowly dying.

38:23.211 --> 38:27.178
Whatever was in the room
had to have picked my dog up,

38:27.179 --> 38:31.139
and thrown him through the window.

38:47.963 --> 38:52.944
It was terrible to watch
your dog in pain and...

38:52.945 --> 38:55.465
And suffering.

38:59.475 --> 39:02.410
He was shaking, trembling.

39:02.411 --> 39:06.671
Something had terrified him very badly.

39:11.311 --> 39:13.855
This was the last straw.

39:13.856 --> 39:19.136
And me and my sister, we
wanted out of that house.

39:21.006 --> 39:23.781
I had to get out of the house.

39:23.782 --> 39:28.162
That's what my heart told me, get out.

39:31.032 --> 39:36.174
Lisa and I knew that the only way we
were going to get out of that house.

39:36.175 --> 39:38.670
Is if we were to marry.

39:38.671 --> 39:42.470
That's what my dad would want us to do.

39:42.471 --> 39:45.677
I had my high school sweetheart.

39:45.678 --> 39:48.178
He was my knight in shining armor.

39:48.179 --> 39:53.759
He was the one that would
provide me that escape route.

39:55.148 --> 39:58.251
And give me a way out of that house.

39:58.252 --> 40:00.232
And...

40:00.448 --> 40:03.624
He did that with my father's blessing.

40:03.625 --> 40:05.545
Okay.

40:06.137 --> 40:08.689
Lisa and I married about a year apart.

40:08.690 --> 40:11.450
We were both 19.

40:11.539 --> 40:13.326
You look beautiful, Lisa.

40:13.327 --> 40:15.914
I didn't marry for love.
I married for freedom...

40:15.915 --> 40:18.555
Everybody smile.

40:18.813 --> 40:24.713
My freedom, to get out of that
house, get as far away as I could.

40:34.525 --> 40:38.374
I believe that the house
affected my father's health.

40:38.375 --> 40:44.080
I believe that it made him more
vulnerable, dragged him down.

40:44.081 --> 40:46.149
He wasn't the same man.

40:46.150 --> 40:49.886
He used to be strong. He used to be...

40:49.887 --> 40:51.988
A very charismatic man.

40:51.989 --> 40:55.769
He lost a big part of himself.

40:56.701 --> 40:59.207
We just were tired of it.

40:59.208 --> 41:04.668
We really felt that it was
time to get out of there.

41:11.054 --> 41:14.419
He wanted to start over
and make a new life.

41:14.420 --> 41:16.531
Are you ready?

41:16.532 --> 41:18.392
Yes.

41:35.967 --> 41:41.867
He tried as hard as he could when he was
alive to protect his wife and his family.

41:44.156 --> 41:47.318
He nurtured us as a father.

41:47.319 --> 41:49.861
And he did the best he could.

41:49.862 --> 41:53.486
I do believe that the evilness
that was in that house,

41:53.487 --> 41:55.995
over years it took a toll on my dad.

41:55.996 --> 42:00.436
And it affected him, and broke him down.

42:03.387 --> 42:08.307
It destroyed his life,
it destroyed his health.

42:08.487 --> 42:11.487
It destroyed my dad.
