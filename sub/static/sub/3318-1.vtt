You were nearly poisoned.

Someone with ties to the

01:48.776 --> 01:50.175
Of England, no doubt.

Every meal you've eaten

Has been tasted for poison

Since you left
your mother's breast.

Mary, you are the queen
of scotland.

She is beautiful.

I don't know if I'm ready.

02:32.553 --> 02:35.254
To leave here or marry
the future king of France?

02:35.256 --> 02:37.189
Both.

I hoped I would get to go back

02:46.300 --> 02:47.699
You're nearly a woman,

02:47.701 --> 02:49.501
And francis is nearly a man.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.736
It's time.

For your faith,

03:02.516 --> 03:04.183
For your people,

03:04.185 --> 03:05.918
For scotland.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.886
He will love you.

03:07.888 --> 03:10.822
I'm not sure that matters.

03:10.824 --> 03:13.192
It does to you.

Girl:
Mary...

03:16.563 --> 03:17.896
Rose.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.198
Be careful.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.666
There are ghosts there.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.668
At the castle?

03:22.670 --> 03:24.469
They say the halls
are filled with them.

03:24.471 --> 03:26.438
Tortured souls,

03:26.440 --> 03:28.907
A girl whose face is a ruin.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.842
She hides it.

03:30.844 --> 03:34.313
I was at french court before,
you know,

03:34.315 --> 03:35.847
When I was your age.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.616
I didn't see any ghosts.

03:37.618 --> 03:40.485
But what if they saw you?

03:45.291 --> 03:47.526
Guard:
Your grace.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.835
(horse whinnies)

04:22.795 --> 04:24.796
(sighs)
sebastian.

04:24.798 --> 04:27.532
Francis, they were
looking for you everywhere.

04:27.534 --> 04:29.334
Tough to find you.

04:29.336 --> 04:30.502
I was riding.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.537
Really? Who?

04:32.539 --> 04:34.006
(chuckles)

04:34.008 --> 04:35.841
So, bash, how's the mood?

04:35.843 --> 04:38.677
Father's or the
mood in general?

04:38.679 --> 04:40.312
Tense to both.

04:40.314 --> 04:41.680
Planning for
your sister's wedding.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.849
Is your mother in there?

04:43.851 --> 04:45.684
No, only royals
and their attendants allowed.

04:45.686 --> 04:46.952
But your mother

04:46.954 --> 04:49.554
Is in fine form, god save you.

04:49.556 --> 04:51.056
I'm off now that you're here.

04:52.492 --> 04:54.493
Lucky bastard.

04:54.495 --> 04:57.396
Woman:
<i>Mary should be protected.</i>

04:57.398 --> 04:59.965
Hidden.
So you've claimed.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.900
You also claimed she
needed to be kept at convent

05:01.902 --> 05:03.535
For her education,
when we both know

05:03.537 --> 05:05.070
She simply irritated you.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.605
Mary's arrival now upstages

05:06.607 --> 05:07.906
Our daughter's wedding.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.441
It's the perfect occasion

05:09.443 --> 05:11.343
To showcase the
alliance with scotland.

05:11.345 --> 05:14.046
Half the continent's royalty
will be feeding at our trough.

05:14.048 --> 05:16.315
There are those that say

05:16.317 --> 05:18.884
Too many alliances make
a king look weak.

05:18.886 --> 05:21.753
Then why did we sell
our daughter to Spain?

05:21.755 --> 05:23.889
I'm told I was needed.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.325
Or should I just come back
on my wedding day?

05:26.327 --> 05:28.860
You've chosen my wife;
have you set the date, too?

05:28.862 --> 05:30.962
Here's the date: When I say so.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.531
Or England turns its sword

05:32.533 --> 05:33.765
In our direction.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.636
She's on her way.

05:37.638 --> 05:38.904
Mary stuart, you mean.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.605
I heard.
You don't sound

05:40.607 --> 05:42.007
Very enthusiastic.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.408
You were playmates once.

05:43.410 --> 05:45.711
She had skinny legs,

05:45.713 --> 05:48.447
A missing front tooth
and strong opinions.

05:48.449 --> 05:49.881
I'm sure the adult tooth
has come in.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.350
The opinions you can ignore.

05:51.352 --> 05:53.018
Isn't that right, catherine?

05:53.020 --> 05:55.987
Her ladies-in-waiting are
on their way as well.

05:55.989 --> 05:58.990
Three titled,
the other ridiculously rich.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.525
Just your type.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.993
At least your bride
has a country

06:01.995 --> 06:03.662
And an army, should you need it.

06:06.899 --> 06:09.468
I may not have been born
with a crown,

06:09.470 --> 06:11.370
But this country relies
on my money.

06:11.372 --> 06:14.005
(scoffs)
let him talk like a king.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.007
(chuckles)
your wedding won't happen

06:16.009 --> 06:18.043
Until <i>I</i> say so.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.811
I'm on your side.

06:19.813 --> 06:20.879
Always.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.948
I know.

06:31.758 --> 06:32.758
(sniffs)

06:32.760 --> 06:34.993
That's disgusting.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.496
Where she puts it,
he won't smell it.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.831
Unless he's a very good husband.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.133
Imagine that.

06:41.135 --> 06:43.802
You do want elisabeth
to bear sons.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.937
Oh, as soon as possible.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.507
Or what is a wife's value?

06:48.509 --> 06:51.143
But what about
my son francis?

06:51.145 --> 06:53.645
What do your visions say
about his future?

06:53.647 --> 06:56.948
Tell me, nostradamus,
what have you seen?

06:56.950 --> 06:58.650
I-I've had fleeting images,

06:58.652 --> 07:01.052
But as yet,
their meaning is unclear.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.688
Perhaps if you were
more specific

07:03.690 --> 07:04.790
About your concerns.

07:04.792 --> 07:07.592
Well, will he love her?

07:07.594 --> 07:09.594
Will she love him?

07:09.596 --> 07:11.930
How do I control
a daughter-in-law

07:11.932 --> 07:14.132
Who's a queen
in her own right?

07:14.134 --> 07:15.200
Is that what bothers you?

07:15.202 --> 07:16.701
Her power?

07:16.703 --> 07:18.537
Mm.
Or the fact
that she's young

07:18.539 --> 07:20.005
And pretty?

07:20.007 --> 07:22.207
I've just had a vision.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.576
(gasps)
I see you,

07:24.578 --> 07:26.711
Beheaded, at my command.

07:28.014 --> 07:29.714
Said with gratitude

07:29.716 --> 07:32.017
For the secrets we share.

Oh, mary, your hair.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.057
Didn't the nuns
teach you anything?

09:19.059 --> 09:20.792
(chuckles)

09:20.794 --> 09:24.062
Oh, greer,
those can't all be clothes.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.131
There's jewelry
and silver, too.

09:26.133 --> 09:28.900
I'm making up in volume for what
I lack in station, I suppose.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.001
Look, here they come.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.636
(playing fanfare)

09:31.638 --> 09:33.138
Guard:
His royal highness,

09:33.140 --> 09:35.140
King henry ii.
There's the king.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.808
That's king henry,

09:36.810 --> 09:38.009
But is that catherine?

09:38.011 --> 09:39.344
No, they're still waiting
on her.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.748
That's diane de portiers,
the king's mistress.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.116
So the rumors are true.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.785
Lola:
Unlike her,

09:46.787 --> 09:49.020
You'll have no trouble
finding husbands here.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.789
We'll certainly enjoy
the hunt.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.357
What about you?

09:52.359 --> 09:53.892
Oh, don't tell me.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.760
It's about that boy
from aberdeen.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.228
Colin said he'd wait for me.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.863
Till when?

09:58.865 --> 10:00.799
We might never be
back on scottish soil,

10:00.801 --> 10:02.834
Not if it all works out
and mary reigns here.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.370
What do you mean, "if"?

10:05.372 --> 10:07.105
Make no mistake,
we're here now

10:07.107 --> 10:09.174
To get our young
queen in the game.

10:09.176 --> 10:11.977
Alliances can shift.

10:11.979 --> 10:14.980
Before they do, mary needs
to win the prince's heart.

10:17.083 --> 10:18.917
Is that francis?

10:18.919 --> 10:20.385
He's gorgeous.

10:20.387 --> 10:23.088
Mary:
No, that's not francis.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.789
I know it isn't.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.324
Lola:
Then that must be sebastian,

10:26.326 --> 10:29.194
The king's bastard,
diane's son.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.129
I hear the king favors him.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.865
(fanfare playing)

10:33.867 --> 10:39.170
Guard:
Her majesty, queen catherine!

11:06.232 --> 11:07.966
I don't believe it.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.300
Your grace.

11:09.302 --> 11:11.136
No, call me mary,
please.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.771
Francis.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.339
The castle
seems bigger.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.740
Is that possible?

11:15.742 --> 11:16.808
And you, too,
of course.

11:18.044 --> 11:19.344
Is that such a surprise?

11:19.346 --> 11:21.179
No. Especially since your legs

11:21.181 --> 11:22.747
Were always
longer than mine.

11:22.749 --> 11:24.416
You know, I hated that
when we were young--

11:24.418 --> 11:27.018
I was always chasing
after you-- but now...

11:27.020 --> 11:28.820
Uh...

11:28.822 --> 11:31.423
Now it suits you.

11:43.903 --> 11:45.136
What is it?

11:45.138 --> 11:47.172
You've had a vision.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.140
It's clear now.

11:49.142 --> 11:50.742
I saw your son's future...

11:50.744 --> 11:52.043
My lady...
Welcome,
your grace.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.412
Nostradamus:
...His union... With mary.

11:54.414 --> 11:55.880
Well, say it.

11:56.816 --> 11:59.217
She will cost francis his life.

12:11.964 --> 12:14.499
You have returned to the court
at your own queen's bidding.

12:14.501 --> 12:17.402
As noble ladies,
you must counsel her,

12:17.404 --> 12:20.105
Prepare her,
account for her.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.340
For the princess
elisabeth's wedding,

12:22.342 --> 12:23.975
As with any event,

12:23.977 --> 12:25.944
You must acquaint
yourselves, and mary,

12:25.946 --> 12:28.947
With all visiting royalty
and dignitaries.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.282
Who amongst you is fluent
in italian?

12:32.952 --> 12:34.919
I suppose I am.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.988
You will sit next
to the pope's cousin.

12:38.290 --> 12:40.492
He has no teeth
and speaks very quickly.

12:40.494 --> 12:42.761
(giggling)

12:45.197 --> 12:47.799
♪

13:01.147 --> 13:02.947
Aylee:
Are these dresses
from paris?

13:02.949 --> 13:04.349
Yes, every one.
Oh...

13:04.351 --> 13:05.550
If colin could see me,

13:05.552 --> 13:07.519
He'd marry me in a second.

13:07.521 --> 13:10.221
I look of age now;
we all do.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.791
You know what
I'd like to do?

13:12.793 --> 13:14.159
Explore.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.027
We haven't been here
since we were children.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.228
Surely the castle's changed.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.429
Who's with me?

13:18.431 --> 13:19.831
Kenna:
I am!
Go.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.099
I'll find you later.

13:21.101 --> 13:23.168
There's something
I want to see.

13:32.878 --> 13:35.280
(children's laughter echoing)

13:41.554 --> 13:44.022
(whispering):
Francis is a girl's name.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.191
(laughter echoing)

13:57.436 --> 13:59.237
(distant creak)

14:10.482 --> 14:11.983
Mary.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.852
Francis.
Um, I didn't know you...

14:13.854 --> 14:15.019
What are you
doing here?

14:15.021 --> 14:16.554
I was exploring.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.890
These were my old rooms.
Don't you remember?

14:18.892 --> 14:20.959
Not anymore.
No one comes up here.

14:20.961 --> 14:23.361
Except you.

14:26.298 --> 14:29.067
What is that?

14:29.069 --> 14:30.335
Is all of this yours?

14:31.637 --> 14:33.104
I-I make knives,

14:33.106 --> 14:34.305
And swords.

14:34.307 --> 14:35.940
At least,
I'm trying to learn.

14:35.942 --> 14:38.309
To be a bladesmith?

14:38.311 --> 14:40.111
Is that a requirement
for future kings now?

14:40.113 --> 14:41.446
When you say it like that,

14:41.448 --> 14:43.214
It sounds ridiculous, yes.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.649
No, no, I think
it's fantastic.

14:44.651 --> 14:47.085
But did you
make all these?

14:47.087 --> 14:49.921
Why?

14:49.923 --> 14:51.389
I can't help thinking that

14:51.391 --> 14:53.024
Every man, even a king,

14:53.026 --> 14:54.359
Should have
some kind of skill.

14:56.161 --> 14:57.662
Well, you're going to be
a great ruler someday.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.063
Isn't that enough?

14:59.065 --> 15:00.498
I hope I will be,

15:00.500 --> 15:02.433
But I meant
a real skill.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.269
One that
I didn't inherit,

15:04.271 --> 15:05.603
Wasn't given to me

15:05.605 --> 15:07.005
And-and can't
be taken away.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.573
My brother--

15:08.575 --> 15:10.508
My half-brother,
bash--

15:10.510 --> 15:12.076
He has so many.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.978
He wants to learn
something, he does,

15:13.980 --> 15:16.481
He wants to
go somewhere, he goes.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.283
With my father's
blessing.

15:19.618 --> 15:21.352
They don't worry
about him dying so much

15:21.354 --> 15:22.987
That they don't
let him live.

15:22.989 --> 15:24.455
Because he'll
never be king.

15:28.294 --> 15:30.461
I can milk a goat

15:30.463 --> 15:32.497
And cut peat
for the fire.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.465
The nuns, you know.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.000
Impressive.

15:36.002 --> 15:37.201
(laughs)

15:37.203 --> 15:38.536
I suppose if there was

15:38.538 --> 15:40.538
Ever an uprising that
sent my line into hiding,

15:40.540 --> 15:42.941
I could always get by
as a blacksmith.

15:44.343 --> 15:45.610
But I'd save you.

15:47.513 --> 15:50.615
And we could go to
scotland and rule there.

15:50.617 --> 15:53.284
That's a...
(clears throat)

15:53.286 --> 15:54.585
That's a very kind offer.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.521
I hope I never have
to take you up on it.

16:14.673 --> 16:16.140
Natalia.

16:17.509 --> 16:20.678
Did anyone see you
come in here?

16:20.680 --> 16:22.146
No.

16:24.717 --> 16:27.085
They never do.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.187
They never will.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.556
Nothing's changed here.

16:33.258 --> 16:34.525
Nothing has to.

16:52.711 --> 16:54.178
(dog growling)

16:57.082 --> 16:58.716
(barking)

16:59.618 --> 17:02.086
Stirling, no!

17:02.088 --> 17:03.254
Stirling!

17:04.456 --> 17:06.524
Come on, boy!

17:19.071 --> 17:20.805
Mary. What is it?

17:20.807 --> 17:22.473
Um, I brought
you something,

17:22.475 --> 17:24.208
To decorate
your swords with.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.376
Now's not a good time.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.544
Oh...

17:26.546 --> 17:28.246
Next time,
you should be announced.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.714
My page is there for a reason.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.416
I don't understand.

17:31.418 --> 17:32.483
You shouldn't be here.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.152
Why do you sound so...

17:35.220 --> 17:36.821
Are you alone?

17:38.424 --> 17:40.091
Are you with someone?

17:40.093 --> 17:42.660
If you are ever going to be
the queen of France,

17:42.662 --> 17:44.295
You need to understand
something.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.130
Kings do not answer
to their wives.

17:58.310 --> 17:59.577
(sighs)

18:14.293 --> 18:15.293
(grunts)

18:15.295 --> 18:16.761
(pebbles splash into water)

18:16.763 --> 18:17.762
(stirling barking)

18:17.764 --> 18:20.264
(barking continues)

18:20.266 --> 18:23.301
Stirling...
No, come back! Stirling!

18:23.303 --> 18:25.536
(barking continues)
stirling?

18:25.538 --> 18:27.305
Stirling,
come back!
Go on.

18:29.141 --> 18:30.408
Stirling,
come back!
Mary?

18:30.410 --> 18:32.143
Stirling!
Mary.

18:32.145 --> 18:34.145
Stirling, come back!
(horse whinnies)
mary!

18:34.147 --> 18:35.313
Stirling!
Stirling!

18:35.315 --> 18:36.314
Stirling!

18:36.316 --> 18:37.482
No, no, wait.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.550
Mary.

18:39.552 --> 18:42.820
Young girls-- royals, queens--

18:42.822 --> 18:45.723
Do not leave the castle alone.

18:45.725 --> 18:46.858
But my-my dog...

18:46.860 --> 18:48.192
Let him go.

18:48.194 --> 18:49.660
Do not go
into those woods.

18:49.662 --> 18:50.661
Do you hear me?

18:50.663 --> 18:52.597
Why not?

18:52.599 --> 18:54.665
What's in
those woods?

18:54.667 --> 18:56.334
Besides my dog,
who I might've caught

18:56.336 --> 18:57.535
If you hadn't
stopped me.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.237
He'll find
his way back.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.239
There's food and warmth.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.640
Who wouldn't want
to be at the castle?

19:04.276 --> 19:06.477
Except, perhaps, you.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.546
Rather be at the convent,
would you?

19:08.548 --> 19:11.282
Eating porridge
and trudging through mud?

19:11.284 --> 19:13.751
I quite like the way
mud feels underfoot.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.686
Maybe you'll be sent
back to the nuns.

19:15.688 --> 19:16.888
For misbehaving.

19:16.890 --> 19:18.890
You're cheeky.

19:18.892 --> 19:20.558
And you're upset
about more than your dog

19:20.560 --> 19:22.426
Taking a little jaunt
into the wild.

19:22.428 --> 19:23.694
What is it?

19:23.696 --> 19:26.230
You should ask
your brother.

19:26.232 --> 19:28.432
Ask him what?

19:28.434 --> 19:30.434
Why he's such a moody,
arrogant ass.

19:32.237 --> 19:33.771
We're half-brothers,
by the way.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.239
Nothing in common
but our father, really.

19:35.241 --> 19:36.574
Oh.

19:36.576 --> 19:40.344
But I'll mention your
discontent to francis.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.513
Don't bother.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.183
And I'll find your dog.

19:53.659 --> 19:56.227
(bird cawing, wings fluttering)

19:57.429 --> 19:59.497
(humming)

20:07.673 --> 20:09.507
Warm enough?

20:09.509 --> 20:10.708
Colin!

20:10.710 --> 20:12.810
(laughs)
I don't believe it!

20:12.812 --> 20:13.811
What are you
doing here?

20:13.813 --> 20:15.746
You can't...

20:19.885 --> 20:21.285
I've been
thinking of you

20:21.287 --> 20:22.920
From the moment
you got on that boat.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.722
I borrowed money
and left the next day.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.592
I want you to stay,

20:27.594 --> 20:29.660
But we'll be found out.

20:31.430 --> 20:33.497
We need permission.

20:34.433 --> 20:35.933
(laughing):
Oh...

20:35.935 --> 20:38.903
What a grand,
romantic gesture.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.805
And you say your queen, mary,

20:40.807 --> 20:42.006
Knows your young man?

20:42.008 --> 20:44.408
Uh, she hasn't met colin,

20:44.410 --> 20:45.810
But she knows his people.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.578
Oh...

20:47.580 --> 20:50.948
Your father is a cousin
of mary's father, james?

20:50.950 --> 20:52.817
My father served him

20:52.819 --> 20:54.352
Until the day
king james died.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.853
His grace
was generous,

20:55.855 --> 20:57.855
He granted my father
large holdings,

20:57.857 --> 21:00.925
But...
We're no relation.

21:02.728 --> 21:04.528
You come from
former servants...

21:04.530 --> 21:08.399
My, what a rise
your people have made.

21:08.401 --> 21:11.636
I do love
a success story.

21:11.638 --> 21:14.005
Stay and tell me
all about it.

21:14.873 --> 21:16.507
Oh, lola,

21:16.509 --> 21:18.643
You should go find mary,
keep her on task

21:18.645 --> 21:20.378
So we can all
enjoy the wedding.

21:39.898 --> 21:41.899
Aylee: So bash just
happened upon you.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.901
You don't believe that.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.870
He has a terrible
reputation with women,

21:45.872 --> 21:47.638
He knows no bounds.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.573
Maybe it runs
in the family.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.544
Did something happen
with francis?

21:53.546 --> 21:55.680
No, no, nothing.

21:55.682 --> 21:57.381
Really, it's fine,

21:57.383 --> 21:59.083
And we need to get ready
for the wedding.

21:59.085 --> 22:01.352
So go on...

22:01.354 --> 22:02.720
I'll tell the servants

22:02.722 --> 22:03.921
You're ready to be
bathed and dressed.

22:03.923 --> 22:05.623
Thank you.

22:13.965 --> 22:15.633
(dog barking)

22:28.080 --> 22:30.715
(distant creaking)

22:35.587 --> 22:37.855
Hello?

22:37.857 --> 22:39.623
Is anyone here?

22:39.625 --> 22:41.492
(creaking)

23:05.150 --> 23:07.451
Female voice (raspy):
Taste of love and sorrow,

23:07.453 --> 23:09.687
But don't drink the wine.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.555
Don't.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.827
Who are you?

23:22.834 --> 23:24.668
(distant creaking)

23:45.824 --> 23:47.825
(door creaks)

23:50.729 --> 23:52.062
(departing footsteps echoing)

23:52.064 --> 23:54.565
(door creaks shut)

24:01.506 --> 24:03.641
(fireworks whistling, popping)

24:05.177 --> 24:08.446
(festive music playing)

24:27.732 --> 24:29.934
We're very happy
to be back at court.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.101
Your grace.

24:31.103 --> 24:32.570
Beautiful evening,
is it not?

24:32.572 --> 24:35.039
Why aren't you
with colin?

24:42.781 --> 24:44.248
What's he doing with mary?

24:44.250 --> 24:47.051
She's his queen.

24:47.053 --> 24:49.220
He's just paying his respects.

24:49.222 --> 24:50.688
Let's raise a glass.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.923
To the happy couple.

24:52.925 --> 24:54.725
Man:
Hear, hear.

24:54.727 --> 24:56.927
Female voice (raspy):
<i>...Don't drink the wine.</i>

25:10.775 --> 25:13.043
Mary:
Oh, lola, no.

25:13.045 --> 25:15.179
Aylee, I want
to go dance.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.614
You can't dance alone.

25:16.616 --> 25:18.849
I won't be alone.

25:20.151 --> 25:21.685
Lola, come dance
with me.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.621
Take off you shoes.
Come on. Dance with me.

25:23.623 --> 25:24.755
Take off you shoes.

25:24.757 --> 25:25.823
(women laugh)

25:29.227 --> 25:31.762
♪

25:31.764 --> 25:33.864
(laughter continues)

25:37.869 --> 25:40.771
(laughter, whooping)

25:47.646 --> 25:50.180
We're overrun by scots.

25:50.182 --> 25:54.218
(onlookers cheer, applaud)

26:05.263 --> 26:08.132
(partiers clamor happily)

26:10.001 --> 26:12.803
Woman:
Dance with me! Come dance!

26:22.013 --> 26:23.647
(laughter echoing)

26:45.136 --> 26:47.905
Lola: Look... Elisabeth and
philip are leaving.

26:47.907 --> 26:49.840
Kenna: It's time for
the consummation;

26:49.842 --> 26:51.942
The ritual, the ceremony,
the mystery.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.143
Aren't you curious?

26:53.145 --> 26:54.378
(laughing)

26:58.750 --> 27:00.384
Shh...

27:00.386 --> 27:02.886
Aylee:
We can't actually watch them...
You know.

27:02.888 --> 27:04.188
Greer:
It's a tradition for royals.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.923
Aylee:
Well, we are not allowed.

27:05.925 --> 27:08.859
Don't you want to know
what you're in for someday?

27:08.861 --> 27:10.894
With your francis?

27:16.301 --> 27:17.935
Bishop: <i>Pax vobis.</i>
<i>In nomini patri</i>

27:17.937 --> 27:22.072
<i>Et fili et spiritus sancti.</i>
<i>Amen.</i>

27:32.384 --> 27:35.052
(groans)

27:35.054 --> 27:37.721
(door creaks shut)

27:52.437 --> 27:55.239
We're the only ones
that matter here.

28:12.857 --> 28:15.993
(both moan softly)

28:20.198 --> 28:22.332
(moaning continues)

28:30.475 --> 28:32.409
(gasps quietly)

28:39.384 --> 28:40.818
Let's go.

28:45.757 --> 28:47.191
Come on.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.994
Mary:
Go, before anyone sees us.

30:10.842 --> 30:13.177
Excuse me.

30:20.251 --> 30:21.852
I've been wanting
to talk to you.

30:21.854 --> 30:23.120
There's something
I need to say to you.

30:23.122 --> 30:24.321
When you came to my room,

30:24.323 --> 30:25.823
I-I shouldn't have said
what I did.

30:25.825 --> 30:27.057
There were other ways
of handling this.

30:27.059 --> 30:29.259
Handling what? Me?

30:29.261 --> 30:30.928
You do realize
that we're going

30:30.930 --> 30:32.296
To be married
someday, don't you?

30:32.298 --> 30:34.431
Believe me, I know.
I know you had a life

30:34.433 --> 30:36.233
Before I got here.
It's not about that.

30:36.235 --> 30:38.302
Don't you think
that we owe it

30:38.304 --> 30:39.536
To each other,
to our families,

30:39.538 --> 30:41.371
To our countries,
to give it a chance?

30:41.373 --> 30:42.940
It's not that simple.

30:42.942 --> 30:44.308
Not that simple?!
What's not simple?!

30:44.310 --> 30:45.943
We've been engaged
since we were six!

30:45.945 --> 30:47.277
It's all arranged.

30:47.279 --> 30:49.279
How awful must you
find me to do this?

30:49.281 --> 30:51.014
It's not you.
You're-you're beautiful

30:51.016 --> 30:53.050
And clever and unpredictable,
but it doesn't matter.

30:53.052 --> 30:55.152
What matters is
what's right for my country.

30:55.154 --> 30:57.487
France is not as strong
as you might think, or care,

30:57.489 --> 30:59.489
Which maybe you don't,
but I do.

30:59.491 --> 31:02.326
I'm going to be king someday,
responsible for my people.

31:02.328 --> 31:05.095
And right now, an alliance with
scotland could destroy France.

31:07.532 --> 31:09.399
You don't want to marry me.

31:11.202 --> 31:13.470
You don't want this at all.

31:13.472 --> 31:15.372
Things could change.

31:15.374 --> 31:18.008
Well, it isn't your decision,
it's your father's.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.910
You don't see him pushing
a wedding either, do you?

31:19.912 --> 31:22.880
All engagements really do
is hold alliances.

31:22.882 --> 31:24.448
He's betting we might need
scotland,

31:24.450 --> 31:26.250
I'm betting we'll find more
support elsewhere.

31:26.252 --> 31:28.352
I know it's not what
you want to hear.

31:28.354 --> 31:30.287
But you won't love me.

31:30.289 --> 31:31.555
You won't let yourself.

31:31.557 --> 31:34.157
Love is irrelevant
to people like us.

31:34.159 --> 31:37.928
We who are so privileged
in so many ways with that.

31:37.930 --> 31:39.997
All I'm asking you
to do is wait,

31:39.999 --> 31:41.498
See how things go.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.033
See how things go for France.

31:43.035 --> 31:46.270
I guess it is simple after all.

31:46.272 --> 31:49.139
But you aren't not the only one
with a country to think of.

31:55.513 --> 31:58.181
(thunder rumbling)

32:16.401 --> 32:17.935
(screams)

32:17.937 --> 32:19.536
Your grace, please!
Your grace, please!

32:19.538 --> 32:20.437
No! Guards!

32:20.439 --> 32:21.605
(door bangs open)

32:21.607 --> 32:24.007
Colin, no!

32:24.009 --> 32:25.108
Forgive me! I...!

32:25.110 --> 32:26.543
Come on, colin...

32:26.545 --> 32:28.045
Please, your grace, forgive me!

32:28.047 --> 32:30.213
Move!
I couldn't...!

32:30.215 --> 32:31.982
Your grace, please!

32:32.550 --> 32:33.951
Guard:
Come on!

32:33.953 --> 32:35.452
(door shuts)

32:40.358 --> 32:42.259
How could this happen?
Where were the guards?

32:42.261 --> 32:43.527
Why didn't they stop him?

32:43.529 --> 32:44.728
I hope mary did
if they didn't.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.330
They'll question her virtue.

32:46.332 --> 32:47.731
If she's not a virgin,
then she'll

32:47.733 --> 32:49.199
Never be the queen
of France,

32:49.201 --> 32:50.734
And our chances
at court will be over.

32:50.736 --> 32:52.636
You don't know what happened,
any of you.

32:52.638 --> 32:54.104
Mary:
Tell me.

32:57.041 --> 33:00.644
I've spoken to him.

33:00.646 --> 33:03.580
He's being held.

33:03.582 --> 33:05.115
I bribed a guard.

33:05.450 --> 33:07.985
Colin's a good man;
a boy still.

33:07.987 --> 33:09.486
What did he say?

33:09.488 --> 33:11.655
What possible defense
could he have given you?

33:11.657 --> 33:13.156
He said he was forced.

33:13.158 --> 33:15.492
He wouldn't say by whom.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.494
He couldn't,
he was so afraid.

33:17.496 --> 33:18.762
But he said

33:18.764 --> 33:20.497
There are people,
powerful people,

33:20.499 --> 33:22.199
Behind this,
and he had no choice.

33:22.201 --> 33:23.500
What people?

33:23.502 --> 33:25.635
Here, in the castle.

33:25.637 --> 33:28.672
He wouldn't risk
saying more.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.407
Do you believe him, mary?

33:35.113 --> 33:37.581
He looked so surprised
that I would fight back.

33:38.549 --> 33:40.317
That I would even wake.

33:40.319 --> 33:41.518
That you'd wake?

33:41.520 --> 33:42.753
He attacked you.

33:44.422 --> 33:46.189
The wine.

33:48.159 --> 33:50.327
I was told not to drink
the wine.

33:50.329 --> 33:51.328
I was warned.

33:51.330 --> 33:52.496
Warned by whom?

33:56.167 --> 33:58.435
It doesn't matter now.

33:58.437 --> 33:59.770
I believe you.

33:59.772 --> 34:01.338
I believe colin.

34:01.340 --> 34:04.374
Please help him.

34:04.376 --> 34:07.444
I thank you
for your protection last night,

34:07.446 --> 34:09.446
But I need to speak
with colin.

34:09.448 --> 34:12.149
Speak to your assailant?

34:12.151 --> 34:13.550
Why?

34:13.552 --> 34:16.420
Because he is the love
of my dear friend.

34:16.422 --> 34:18.755
And if there was
any misunderstanding,

34:18.757 --> 34:21.591
If I sent the wrong message

34:21.593 --> 34:23.260
In my joy at the wedding...

34:23.262 --> 34:24.828
Take care, child.

34:24.830 --> 34:27.297
If anyone knew
you were even asking this...

34:27.299 --> 34:29.232
Catherine, she needs to know.

34:29.234 --> 34:32.436
Gossip poisons too.

34:32.438 --> 34:34.404
It can poison
a young queen's reputation,

34:34.406 --> 34:37.140
Her heirs' right to the throne,
an entire kingdom.

34:37.142 --> 34:39.776
You may have
behaved foolishly,

34:39.778 --> 34:41.645
But you are not responsible
for your countryman's actions.

34:41.647 --> 34:44.214
Mary:
<i>Colin mcphail</i>

34:44.216 --> 34:45.582
<i>Is my subject.</i>

34:45.584 --> 34:48.218
I am his queen,
and I demand to speak with him.

34:48.220 --> 34:49.453
Witnesses have come forward.

34:49.455 --> 34:51.221
<i>The boy played a role</i>

34:51.223 --> 34:52.389
<i>In an english plot to destroy</i>

34:52.391 --> 34:53.590
Your engagement

34:53.592 --> 34:55.192
And scotland's alliance
with France.

34:55.194 --> 34:57.127
An english plot, you're sure?

34:57.129 --> 35:00.363
You must know if he'd been
successful in his assault,

35:00.365 --> 35:02.666
You'd be unfit to marry our son;

35:02.668 --> 35:04.835
To marry any royal.

35:04.837 --> 35:07.537
My dear,
this was not an act of passion.

35:07.539 --> 35:09.473
It was treason.

35:09.475 --> 35:11.108
(muffled screaming)

35:11.110 --> 35:12.576
King henry:
<i>But it's all settled now.</i>

35:12.578 --> 35:13.610
Colin's been executed.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.412
(grunts, thuds)

35:15.414 --> 35:16.746
What?

35:16.748 --> 35:18.448
He was beheaded this morning.

35:23.387 --> 35:26.523
There was nothing
I could do.

35:26.525 --> 35:28.625
I was too late.

35:28.627 --> 35:30.560
He wasn't a traitor.

35:30.562 --> 35:32.462
He wasn't a rapist.

35:32.464 --> 35:35.132
They said he was involved
in an english plot.

35:35.134 --> 35:37.267
I don't know
who to believe or to trust.

35:37.269 --> 35:39.636
I... I am so sorry, lola.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.404
You're the reason he's dead.

35:41.406 --> 35:43.240
Anyone who's close to you

35:43.242 --> 35:45.509
Lives in constant danger.

35:45.511 --> 35:48.145
We're disposable, all of us.

35:48.147 --> 35:49.779
No, you're not.

35:49.781 --> 35:51.715
I need you.

35:51.717 --> 35:54.217
You're my friends.

35:54.219 --> 35:56.653
Kenna's my friend.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.722
Greer and aylee
are my friends.

35:58.724 --> 36:01.691
You are my queen,
and we're your subjects.

36:01.693 --> 36:05.328
We're here
in service to you,

36:05.330 --> 36:08.331
Whatever that means,
whatever it costs us.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.400
I will protect you.

36:10.402 --> 36:12.769
You can't even protect yourself.

36:12.771 --> 36:15.572
I'll do better.

36:15.574 --> 36:17.807
I promise.

36:24.415 --> 36:26.483
(sobbing)

36:34.859 --> 36:36.626
(sighs)

36:36.628 --> 36:38.528
(stirling whimpers)

36:39.797 --> 36:41.364
Stirling!

36:41.366 --> 36:42.933
You found him.

36:47.772 --> 36:50.707
Oh, stirling.

36:50.709 --> 36:53.310
What did I do?

36:53.312 --> 36:55.879
I'm sorry.

36:55.881 --> 36:59.249
It's just been so hard.

36:59.251 --> 37:00.884
I know.

37:00.886 --> 37:03.753
So much harder
than I thought it would be.

37:03.755 --> 37:05.822
You're not alone here.

37:05.824 --> 37:08.325
I have my friends.

37:08.327 --> 37:10.594
I am not talking
about your friends.

37:18.836 --> 37:20.704
I meant...

37:20.706 --> 37:23.974
I want you to be well,
your grace.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.946
Thank you, sebastian.

37:29.948 --> 37:32.015
Truly.

37:45.329 --> 37:47.264
Mother.

37:47.266 --> 37:48.898
Where did you find the dog?

37:48.900 --> 37:50.634
In the woods.

37:50.636 --> 37:52.569
It was drawn to the blood.

37:52.571 --> 37:54.371
How close did you get?

37:58.042 --> 38:01.478
Take care, my brave son,

38:01.480 --> 38:03.747
Or you will bleed

38:03.749 --> 38:07.517
For a girl
who will never be yours.

38:12.857 --> 38:14.691
(sighs)

38:23.801 --> 38:26.403
You defended a boy
they found in your bed?

38:26.405 --> 38:27.804
What was he doing there?

38:27.806 --> 38:29.005
(sighs)

38:29.007 --> 38:30.607
You can tell me.

38:30.609 --> 38:32.375
I think I know already.

38:32.377 --> 38:34.611
You think I was with him
to get back at you?

38:34.613 --> 38:36.446
I think you're impulsive
and prideful.

38:36.448 --> 38:38.882
He's dead.

38:38.884 --> 38:40.684
Leave it be, I beg of you.

38:40.686 --> 38:41.818
You can't behave like this.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.321
Not at court.

38:44.323 --> 38:45.889
Can't you see what's
at stake here?

38:45.891 --> 38:47.857
Because we're engaged.

38:47.859 --> 38:50.327
But you have no intention
of marrying me.

38:50.329 --> 38:52.028
What if I told them that?

38:52.030 --> 38:53.997
Then this would be over.
You wouldn't do that

38:53.999 --> 38:55.965
Because it's not true;
I-I might marry you.

38:55.967 --> 38:58.034
Someday, maybe, if.

38:58.036 --> 38:59.969
You said that you had
a country to think about.

38:59.971 --> 39:01.838
Were you thinking about scotland
during any of this?

39:01.840 --> 39:03.940
I was thinking about myself,

39:03.942 --> 39:05.675
My friends, my safety...

39:05.677 --> 39:08.044
You could have ruined
your reputation

39:08.046 --> 39:09.612
So that I couldn't marry you,

39:09.614 --> 39:11.715
Even if things go the way
we want them to.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.588
"the way <i>we</i> want them to"?

39:19.857 --> 39:22.125
And how would
"we" want things to go?

39:24.795 --> 39:27.931
If you weren't
the future king of France,

39:27.933 --> 39:29.866
And I was just a girl,

39:29.868 --> 39:32.402
Not the queen of anything,

39:32.404 --> 39:34.437
Would you want this?

39:44.081 --> 39:45.882
I can't do this.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.384
I won't.

39:47.386 --> 39:51.721

39:51.723 --> 39:55.558

39:55.560 --> 39:59.896

40:14.546 --> 40:17.981
You said the potion
would make her

40:17.983 --> 40:19.482
Sleep like the dead.

40:19.484 --> 40:20.917
One glass of wine,

40:20.919 --> 40:22.652
And she'd wake with
her virtue destroyed,

40:22.654 --> 40:24.454
This engagement over.

40:24.456 --> 40:26.456
There was nothing wrong
with my potion.

40:26.458 --> 40:28.558
It was the delivery
of it that failed.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.593
That stupid scottish boy.

40:30.595 --> 40:33.062
A stupid, dead boy.

40:33.064 --> 40:35.064
All to protect his family.

40:35.066 --> 40:36.933
From you.

40:38.035 --> 40:40.103
I had no choice.

40:40.105 --> 40:43.773
The boy would've implicated me,
and you.

40:45.643 --> 40:48.545
Have your visions altered?

40:53.484 --> 40:55.852
No.

40:55.854 --> 40:57.754
Mary will bring

40:57.756 --> 41:00.056
Your son's death.

41:00.058 --> 41:02.192
You cannot relent.

41:02.194 --> 41:06.229
You must continue
to sacrifice.

41:10.768 --> 41:12.936
(thunder rumbling, crashing)

41:12.938 --> 41:15.004
(footsteps crunching)

41:26.517 --> 41:28.518
I don't know who you are

41:28.520 --> 41:30.653
Or why you hide,

41:30.655 --> 41:34.057
But your warning saved me.

41:34.059 --> 41:35.625
Danger surrounds me here,

41:35.627 --> 41:37.627
And I am in your debt.

41:37.629 --> 41:39.696
(thunder crashes)

41:41.899 --> 41:44.801
Are you in danger, too?
