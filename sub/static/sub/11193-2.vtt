WEBVTT

00:39.500 --> 00:41.491
Let's go, Captain!

00:41.539 --> 00:44.707
- Those gliders are comin' back!
- This man's alive!

00:44.698 --> 00:46.490
We cannot wait!

00:53.654 --> 00:56.325
OK, come on! Come on!

00:56.454 --> 00:59.537
Don't panic!
We'll have you outta here in a minute.

00:59.533 --> 01:02.201
<i>Keep moving!</i>

01:04.290 --> 01:06.033
Teal'c!

01:06.088 --> 01:08.759
I gotta go back for Carter.

01:09.688 --> 01:11.727
<i>Help me!</i>

01:18.004 --> 01:20.162
Go, go, I got him! Medic!

01:22.283 --> 01:24.953
He's alive, but he's gonna wish he wasn't.

01:24.962 --> 01:27.203
Let's get him outta here.

01:45.473 --> 01:46.932
Carter!

01:46.993 --> 01:49.662
We've got to go!

01:51.271 --> 01:53.264
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:53.310 --> 01:55.552
Let's get him outta here. Come on.

01:55.591 --> 01:59.503
Dead. He had some kind of seizure.
Bit his own tongue.

02:09.185 --> 02:11.853
<i>Keep it elevated.</i>

02:15.502 --> 02:16.829
No!

02:16.901 --> 02:20.401
I want a full quarantine
until these people can be examined!

02:20.381 --> 02:24.211
- Colonel O'Neill and the rest?
- Right behind me. And a dozen Jaffa.

02:25.699 --> 02:27.157
Lock it up!

02:36.893 --> 02:38.435
Carter,...

02:38.491 --> 02:40.283
...you OK?

02:40.331 --> 02:42.370
Yeah, fine.

02:42.771 --> 02:44.396
Thanks.

03:46.706 --> 03:49.161
There'd been no Goa'uld interference...

03:49.183 --> 03:51.722
...for three centuries.
The Nasyans are a...

03:51.742 --> 03:54.198
<i>.. were a peaceful people.</i>

03:54.221 --> 03:56.299
They were eager to form an alliance...

03:56.341 --> 03:58.748
...and aid us
in setting up a research outpost.

03:58.781 --> 04:00.358
There was no warning.

04:00.419 --> 04:03.705
We hadn't even spotted the mother ship
when the gliders attacked.

04:03.698 --> 04:06.568
It's not normal for the Goa'ulds
to just show up...

04:06.576 --> 04:09.532
...and wipe out a peaceful people
for no reason, is it?

04:09.537 --> 04:11.575
<i>In the past, there was some reason.</i>

04:11.615 --> 04:15.149
They attack civilisations
whose technology poses a threat,...

04:15.133 --> 04:17.624
...but that wasn't the case here.

04:17.651 --> 04:21.153
- Maybe they found out we were there.
- How could they know?

04:21.132 --> 04:24.380
More importantly,
why did this Goa'uld care?

04:24.370 --> 04:28.911
They might've been concerned because
we just kicked the crap out of Apophis.

04:28.846 --> 04:33.011
The truth is we still understand
very little about their society.

04:32.966 --> 04:36.798
I've seen the Goa'uld
wipe out civilisations with no reason,...

04:36.764 --> 04:39.220
...simply because it gave them pleasure.

04:39.242 --> 04:41.863
So, what...?
Nasya was just next on the list?

04:41.882 --> 04:44.884
I wish it was that simple,
but we can't underestimate them.

04:44.882 --> 04:49.211
Maybe the reasons weren't made known
to you, Teal'c. I mean, you are just a Jaffa.

04:52.199 --> 04:57.156
I-I mean Apophis wouldn't necessarily
explain everything to Teal'c,...

04:57.077 --> 05:00.031
...even if he was first prime.

05:00.036 --> 05:02.656
- Would he?
- That is true.

05:02.673 --> 05:04.168
I agree with Sam.

05:04.233 --> 05:08.444
The Goa'uld are more complex
than we're giving them credit for.

05:08.391 --> 05:12.685
The better you understand the enemy,
the better prepared you are in conflict.

05:12.629 --> 05:14.088
Exactly.

05:14.149 --> 05:16.723
What's the status of
the Nasyan survivors?

05:16.747 --> 05:19.951
We managed to rescue 237 people.
They're critically burned.

05:19.947 --> 05:23.731
Some of the overflow were transferred
to the Air Force Academy Hospital.

05:23.706 --> 05:25.531
The rest await relocation.

05:25.584 --> 05:27.375
Proceed.

05:27.425 --> 05:31.504
Sir, I-I think it's important to find out
why Nasya was a Goa'uld target.

05:32.661 --> 05:36.077
Agreed. But relocation is the first priority.

05:37.459 --> 05:40.745
The three new SG teams, 10 through 12,
will coordinate with you.

05:41.218 --> 05:42.213
Dismissed.

05:45.856 --> 05:47.896
Oh, Carter, I hate to be a nag,...

05:47.935 --> 05:51.185
...but old Doc Fraiser says
you haven't been checked out yet.

05:51.173 --> 05:56.547
I'll go right now. Wouldn't want to break
post-mission protocol. Right, Colonel?

06:08.367 --> 06:10.408
Sorry to have to do this.

06:13.646 --> 06:15.721
All right, open.

06:20.321 --> 06:23.406
- Have you had a sore throat lately?
- A little. Why?

06:23.401 --> 06:27.564
There's a small abrasion back there.
I'm gonna have to do a swab.

06:29.879 --> 06:31.918
And open.

06:34.117 --> 06:36.869
Cassandra's been asking about you.

06:36.875 --> 06:38.418
Cassandra?

06:38.475 --> 06:41.427
Yeah! I've been so busy lately.

06:42.673 --> 06:43.918
She understands.

06:43.992 --> 06:48.240
- OK! Let me know if it gets worse.
- I'm free to go out tomorrow, right?

06:48.192 --> 06:52.271
- We're researching relocation sites.
- Sure.

06:52.228 --> 06:57.185
Cassandra will be with me tomorrow.
Why not stop by and spend time with her?

06:57.106 --> 06:59.149
- I will.
- Good.

07:08.701 --> 07:12.367
Patient has third-degree burns
to over 80% of his body.

07:12.341 --> 07:15.177
So far, no sign of infection.

07:15.180 --> 07:16.259
Incredible.

07:18.098 --> 07:20.137
Hey.

07:21.375 --> 07:24.247
- Is this one of the Nasyans we saved?
- Yeah.

07:24.257 --> 07:26.629
<i>He should be dead.</i>

07:26.656 --> 07:28.281
Cassandra is in my office.

07:28.334 --> 07:31.086
We still have rounds,
but you know where it is, right?

08:01.802 --> 08:03.129
Hey there.

08:03.201 --> 08:04.612
Sam!

08:05.240 --> 08:06.651
Euch!

08:08.117 --> 08:10.112
Wow. Nice painting.

08:10.158 --> 08:14.072
You really like it?
My teacher at school says I have talent.

08:14.036 --> 08:15.779
I love it.

08:15.836 --> 08:18.954
- I missed you.
- I know, I'm sorry. I've been so busy.

08:18.954 --> 08:20.283
Very busy.

08:28.230 --> 08:30.387
Cassandra, what is it?

08:41.306 --> 08:43.760
It would be easier on the Nasyans...

08:43.825 --> 08:47.277
...if there were an active civilisation
willing to cooperate.

08:47.264 --> 08:49.754
I'll bet the folks on P3X-422 would be...

08:49.782 --> 08:52.900
Colonel O'Neill,
there's an urgent call for you, sir.

08:54.940 --> 08:57.014
Yeah?

08:57.138 --> 08:59.547
<i>Thanks for coming so quickly.</i>

08:59.578 --> 09:03.445
- What's going on with her?
- I'm not sure. She won't talk to me.

09:03.417 --> 09:06.370
She said she'd see you and only you.

09:09.852 --> 09:10.850
Cassandra?

09:10.933 --> 09:15.559
It's just me, honey.
I've got Colonel O'Neill with me.

09:28.366 --> 09:30.405
Hey.

09:44.879 --> 09:48.250
Janet says you've been a little upset
since Sam was here.

09:57.433 --> 09:59.393
What happened?

09:59.434 --> 10:01.722
She said she'd kill me if I told.

10:03.712 --> 10:07.211
Well, you don't mean "kill you" kill you?

10:09.269 --> 10:12.225
- No, I doubt that.
- She said she would.

10:14.788 --> 10:16.198
Cass,...

10:16.267 --> 10:20.133
...Sam loves you.
She'd never do anything to hurt you.

10:20.105 --> 10:22.144
She would now.

10:26.624 --> 10:27.738
Why?

10:34.859 --> 10:36.899
She's a Goa'uld.

10:40.337 --> 10:44.168
Where's the colonel?
We're due to leave in five minutes.

10:44.134 --> 10:46.293
He said he'd meet us in the gate room.

10:46.335 --> 10:48.375
Well, step on it, then!

10:52.013 --> 10:54.052
What was that?

11:04.168 --> 11:06.409
Where's Colonel O'Neill?

11:07.687 --> 11:09.927
Stand down, campers. We're on a hold.

11:09.964 --> 11:12.717
- Why?
- I don't know.

11:12.725 --> 11:14.265
Some computer glitch.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.760
What the hell was that?

11:23.799 --> 11:26.586
That was enough
to take down an elephant.

11:28.998 --> 11:30.705
<i>Open the Stargate!</i>

11:30.756 --> 11:32.879
Jack, what the hell is going on?

11:32.914 --> 11:35.488
Open the gate now!

11:36.355 --> 11:38.394
I command you.

11:44.350 --> 11:45.181
God...

11:46.789 --> 11:50.374
Open the gate now, or we will all die!

11:51.749 --> 11:53.955
Hold your fire! Teal'c!

11:56.267 --> 11:59.764
- I have a shot, sir.
- And if she drops that grenade, what?

12:07.182 --> 12:10.265
Nobody's gonna open that Stargate.

12:11.100 --> 12:13.140
We're all gonna live,...

12:13.181 --> 12:16.631
...or we're all gonna die right here.

12:17.899 --> 12:20.187
Let me go! I must go!

12:20.216 --> 12:22.338
Not gonna happen.

12:28.573 --> 12:30.613
Take it easy.

12:46.086 --> 12:48.077
<i>I didn't know!</i>

12:48.125 --> 12:52.124
I wasn't sure
until I saw her lose it down there.

12:52.085 --> 12:54.621
Cassie was the one who suspected.

12:54.643 --> 12:57.264
Cassandra still has naqahdah
in her blood.

12:57.282 --> 13:01.495
There may be a connection, a reaction
that made her sense the Goa'uld.

13:01.441 --> 13:04.014
How in the world
did it get into Captain Carter?

13:04.038 --> 13:05.581
Sir, I don't know.

13:05.638 --> 13:09.337
I examined Captain Carter.
There were no visible signs of entry.

13:09.317 --> 13:13.446
She had a small abrasion in her throat.
It could have been anything.

13:13.395 --> 13:16.479
Are you saying
it entered through her mouth?

13:16.474 --> 13:19.047
The parasite attaches itself
to the brainstem.

13:19.072 --> 13:22.107
The soft tissue in the throat
is a good place to start.

13:23.789 --> 13:26.033
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

13:26.072 --> 13:30.317
Oh, God! She was giving some guy
mouth-to-mouth.

13:30.268 --> 13:34.894
There was blood, but she said the guy
just bit his tongue before he died.

13:34.826 --> 13:40.248
If a Goa'uld can infest a human
with no detectable physical signs,...

13:40.145 --> 13:45.932
...then we'll have to start giving personnel
an ultrasound or an MRI.

13:45.822 --> 13:49.951
<i>Let's make sure we haven't let any more
Goa'ulds through the gate this time.</i>

13:49.900 --> 13:53.316
What would a Goa'uld be doing
in a Nasyan man in the first place?

13:53.298 --> 13:56.253
We didn't notice any of them
acting Goa'uldish.

13:56.258 --> 13:59.709
Maybe it was a setup.
Trying to get a spy into one of us.

13:59.696 --> 14:02.567
It is possible the Goa'uld
within Captain Carter...

14:02.576 --> 14:05.826
...has already placed
a device of destruction on this base.

14:05.815 --> 14:08.388
If there's any tampering here,
I want it found.

14:08.412 --> 14:12.159
Teal'c, I'd like you to help.
You'll know what to look for.

14:13.212 --> 14:15.668
Uh, what are we gonna do about Sam?

14:16.971 --> 14:20.053
We're gonna get that damn thing
out of her!

14:20.048 --> 14:22.289
Well, that didn't work with Kawalsky.

14:22.326 --> 14:26.573
And if any of those NID guys,
like Colonel Maybourne, find out...

14:26.527 --> 14:28.981
Well, they're not going to!

14:29.005 --> 14:30.712
Right, General?

14:30.764 --> 14:34.298
Agreed. I'm not giving up
on Captain Carter either.

14:34.282 --> 14:37.115
But until I'm presented
with a viable option,...

14:37.120 --> 14:40.123
...you're in charge
of interrogating the prisoner.

14:40.120 --> 14:43.869
Sir, I don't think that thing in her head's
gonna tell me anything.

14:43.838 --> 14:47.206
Colonel, we need to know
what that Goa'uld's doing here.

14:49.476 --> 14:51.303
Yes, sir.

14:56.834 --> 14:59.501
I'm sorry to bother you.

15:02.471 --> 15:05.044
Just a quick test here.

15:10.587 --> 15:14.586
OK! Now, we have to get rid of
some of those bandages.

15:14.947 --> 15:16.985
Ough!

15:19.904 --> 15:20.899
Oh.

15:26.263 --> 15:28.302
Excuse me.

15:29.461 --> 15:32.296
Your world is an amazing place.

15:32.298 --> 15:36.674
It can be. Um, I'm... I'm Daniel.

15:36.615 --> 15:39.951
You're one of the men responsible
for saving us.

15:39.936 --> 15:41.311
Yeah.

15:41.375 --> 15:43.830
We owe you great thanks.

15:43.855 --> 15:47.803
Could we, uh... Could we talk a minute?

15:57.609 --> 15:59.648
Colonel O'Neill.

16:01.846 --> 16:05.134
I thought you were helping
with the sweep of the base.

16:05.126 --> 16:07.166
I am on my way.

16:17.642 --> 16:19.681
This is difficult.

16:26.158 --> 16:28.447
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

16:31.715 --> 16:34.206
Assault the Goa'uld's ego.

16:34.234 --> 16:36.273
Make him appear foolish.

16:36.312 --> 16:40.561
He may then reveal things,
simply to make himself appear powerful.

16:40.511 --> 16:44.591
Ah, come on, Teal'c.
They're smarter than that.

16:44.629 --> 16:47.463
I have seen
many Goa'uld strategies revealed,...

16:47.467 --> 16:51.254
...and certain victories lost
because of Goa'uld arrogance.

16:51.227 --> 16:53.897
It is the Goa'uld's greatest weakness.

17:03.503 --> 17:05.540
Yeah.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.886
Colonel O'Neill.

17:11.897 --> 17:15.352
When you speak to her,
do not see your friend.

17:18.935 --> 17:20.973
How do you do that?

17:54.122 --> 17:56.790
<i>So,...</i>

17:56.800 --> 17:59.088
...you and I have got to have a little talk.

18:01.999 --> 18:04.207
You really screwed up here, you know.

18:04.239 --> 18:06.278
<i>I mean, you really blew it.</i>

18:07.436 --> 18:09.643
<i>You are weak.</i>

18:09.675 --> 18:11.299
Who's behind bars?

18:11.355 --> 18:13.263
Your tactics will not work.

18:16.353 --> 18:18.392
Not buyin' it, huh?

18:18.432 --> 18:20.638
You must let me go.

18:20.672 --> 18:22.711
Uh...

18:24.269 --> 18:25.263
No.

18:25.347 --> 18:28.634
You really have no idea
why this is happening.

18:33.665 --> 18:36.749
And I guess you don't feel like telling me.

18:38.983 --> 18:43.528
This is a... picture of the man
the Goa'uld came from.

18:50.498 --> 18:52.704
It's my husband.

18:52.739 --> 18:55.608
One of the other Nasyans recognised him.

18:55.617 --> 18:57.824
We found this in our video archive.

18:57.855 --> 19:00.940
And something was inside of him?

19:00.933 --> 19:03.685
I know how difficult this is for you.

19:06.134 --> 19:08.375
I lost my wife to the Goa'uld.

19:10.330 --> 19:12.369
I'm sorry.

19:16.730 --> 19:19.682
I need to know if you
noticed anything different...

19:19.686 --> 19:23.305
...about your husband lately.
I mean... anything.

19:23.286 --> 19:26.489
An injury, or, uh... new scars maybe?

19:27.845 --> 19:29.422
Wait.

19:30.564 --> 19:32.022
Here.

19:32.083 --> 19:34.157
But it was months ago.

19:34.201 --> 19:36.240
Months ago?

19:36.920 --> 19:39.755
Y- y-you never noticed
anything since then?

19:39.759 --> 19:43.544
He wasn't acting strange, violently?

19:43.518 --> 19:45.641
His eyes didn't glow?

19:48.756 --> 19:50.830
I'm sorry.

19:53.795 --> 19:54.992
I'll let you rest.

21:49.826 --> 21:52.493
<i>Let me go.</i>

21:53.986 --> 21:56.654
Let me go through the Stargate.

21:56.703 --> 22:01.031
I will find another host
and send your friend back to you.

22:00.981 --> 22:03.020
You can do that?

22:04.140 --> 22:06.846
Leave a host without killing them?

22:06.859 --> 22:08.140
Yes.

22:08.220 --> 22:10.757
It is possible, but not easy.

22:10.778 --> 22:13.694
I could die, but I promise I will try.

22:13.696 --> 22:15.902
The Nasyan man died when you left him.

22:15.935 --> 22:20.099
The Nasyan man died first.
That is why I left him.

22:20.055 --> 22:22.722
He was beyond
my natural abilities to heal.

22:22.732 --> 22:24.724
What were you doing in him?

22:27.211 --> 22:29.666
Carter's mind would be intact.

22:29.691 --> 22:32.061
She would return to you
as she was before.

22:35.288 --> 22:37.445
You know I can't trust you.

22:37.487 --> 22:40.605
I could've killed you all
when you stopped me leaving.

22:40.605 --> 22:42.397
<i>You didn't want to die.</i>

22:42.444 --> 22:45.362
They would not have killed me.
I am too valuable.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.984
Which is exactly why
we'll never let you go.

22:51.441 --> 22:53.480
I have done nothing to harm you.

22:53.520 --> 22:56.890
But you would not let me go
even if you did believe me.

22:57.279 --> 22:59.318
<i>Oh, God!</i>

22:59.357 --> 23:01.432
He's telling you the truth!

23:01.477 --> 23:02.971
Please, Jack!

23:06.875 --> 23:10.410
No, Jack, please! Don't leave me, please!
Give me a chance.

23:11.512 --> 23:12.971
Don't leave me!

23:13.032 --> 23:15.071
Please!

23:19.431 --> 23:21.470
<i>What will it take?</i>

23:52.296 --> 23:54.538
You have requested my presence.

23:54.576 --> 23:57.991
<i>Jaffa, you must convince
the humans to let me go.</i>

23:57.974 --> 24:01.307
- They will not let you go.
- They are impressive.

24:01.292 --> 24:04.328
The Tauri have become powerful
since the Goa'uld reign.

24:04.330 --> 24:08.163
The System Lords will not allow this
to go unchecked.

24:08.132 --> 24:11.381
I can give the humans information
to help defend themselves.

24:11.368 --> 24:16.741
They are more powerful than you know.
A Goa'uld attack on Earth was thwarted.

24:16.645 --> 24:20.692
- A more powerful assault is being planned.
- They are not fools.

24:20.645 --> 24:24.856
They believe you are here
to plant the seed of that destruction.

24:24.804 --> 24:27.555
Not all Goa'uld are the same.

24:27.561 --> 24:31.394
There are a few that oppose
the System Lords and their ways.

24:31.362 --> 24:33.270
You have heard of the Tok'ra.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.919
Every Goa'uld seeks power...

24:36.958 --> 24:40.160
...and would betray his own brother
to achieve it.

24:40.157 --> 24:42.566
Some seek power for a greater purpose.

24:42.596 --> 24:46.676
Not every Goa'uld is an enemy
to the people of this planet.

24:46.634 --> 24:49.920
The Tok'ra are real,
no matter what Apophis told you.

24:49.913 --> 24:52.616
- I have yet to meet one.
- You have now.

24:52.632 --> 24:55.502
I am Jolinar of Malk-shur.

25:12.345 --> 25:14.336
Oh, uh, excuse me. Sorry.

25:14.383 --> 25:16.672
I just wanted to check on Talia.

25:18.782 --> 25:20.406
How is she?

25:20.461 --> 25:22.500
She's good.

25:37.213 --> 25:39.252
- Rita?
- Yes?

25:39.333 --> 25:41.325
- Have you seen Dr. Jacobs?
- Uh-uh.

25:41.373 --> 25:46.829
What about the most recent blood work
on the patient in 412?

25:47.371 --> 25:49.695
- Here it is.
- Good. Thanks.

26:01.365 --> 26:02.989
Dr. Jacobs!

26:05.321 --> 26:07.280
There is an old legend...

26:07.324 --> 26:11.272
...concerning a group of Goa'uld
who oppose the ways of the System Lords.

26:11.240 --> 26:13.528
This group is called the Tok'ra.

26:13.559 --> 26:18.304
This Goa'uld, Jolinar of Malk-shur,
claims to be part of that group.

26:19.238 --> 26:22.239
Can you be sure he is
who he says he is?

26:24.236 --> 26:25.397
I cannot.

26:25.476 --> 26:29.804
<i>Unfortunately,
we do not carry identification.</i>

26:33.632 --> 26:38.044
OK. Let's try to build
a little trust here, shall we?

26:39.230 --> 26:43.179
One of the Nasyans we brought back
was very badly burned,...

26:43.145 --> 26:47.523
...but somehow he just got up
out of his hospital bed and disappeared.

26:47.467 --> 26:49.874
Who is he?

26:52.182 --> 26:54.140
Must be the Ashrak.

26:55.943 --> 26:58.184
It means hunter.

26:58.942 --> 26:59.938
A Goa'uld?

27:00.020 --> 27:01.016
Yes.

27:01.101 --> 27:05.429
An assassin of the highest rank who
follows the orders of the System Lords.

27:05.377 --> 27:07.251
Who's he here to kill?

27:08.817 --> 27:10.063
Me.

27:13.055 --> 27:15.627
The missing Nasyan is an Ashrak.

27:15.654 --> 27:19.782
A Goa'uld assassin sent by
the System Lords to eliminate Jolinar.

27:19.732 --> 27:21.974
That's the name of the Goa'uld in Sam?

27:22.012 --> 27:23.589
It is.

27:23.651 --> 27:26.520
Jolinar once tried to overthrow
a System Lord,...

27:26.530 --> 27:28.273
...but was defeated by Apophis.

27:28.328 --> 27:31.531
He escaped during the slaughter
of his armies.

27:31.527 --> 27:35.573
It seems this Jolinar is wanted
in Goa'uld town.

27:35.528 --> 27:39.061
He claims to be part of the Tok'ra.

27:39.045 --> 27:41.451
Resistance.

27:42.843 --> 27:47.304
The Tok'ra is a small alliance of Goa'uld
who oppose the System Lords.

27:47.241 --> 27:49.779
My teacher Bra'tac
first spoke to me of them.

27:49.800 --> 27:54.675
This Goa'uld inside Carter could be lying.
Spinning a tale to gain our trust.

27:54.597 --> 27:56.924
It's quite a spin.

27:56.959 --> 27:59.413
The sweep of the base
turned up no evidence.

27:59.436 --> 28:03.599
No tampering with the computer.
We can't find any sign of sabotage.

28:03.555 --> 28:07.255
That's why Jolinar didn't reveal himself
to be a Goa'uld.

28:07.231 --> 28:09.476
He was hiding out in the Nasyan man.

28:09.512 --> 28:11.635
Until he was hunted down by the Ashrak.

28:11.672 --> 28:15.454
When he realised we may have helped
him escape through the Stargate...

28:15.391 --> 28:18.176
He improvised.

28:18.189 --> 28:19.730
So, where are we?

28:19.788 --> 28:22.326
<i>Bottom line, sir?</i>

28:22.347 --> 28:26.214
We may have a Goa'uld out there
who's on a mission to kill Carter.

28:27.224 --> 28:29.929
And we don't even know
what he looks like.

28:33.263 --> 28:35.800
<i>Class one security breach.</i>

28:35.823 --> 28:39.950
<i>Authorised personnel, check in
at their designated security post.</i>

28:39.901 --> 28:42.521
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, Doc. What's up?

28:42.538 --> 28:46.666
- You're sending these people home?
- Yeah, you could say that.

29:03.171 --> 29:04.998
<i>Daniel Jackson.</i>

29:05.049 --> 29:06.757
Yes.

29:06.808 --> 29:11.057
You care about Samantha Carter
as much as O'Neill and Teal'c?

29:11.008 --> 29:12.465
Yes, I do.

29:12.527 --> 29:15.362
Yet this is the first time
you have come to see me.

29:15.365 --> 29:20.442
I came to see if you could give us
a description of the Ashrak.

29:20.363 --> 29:23.898
I will know him only in the moments
before he tortures me to death,...

29:23.884 --> 29:26.670
...killing your friend along with me.

29:26.681 --> 29:29.135
Well, there's no way he's getting in here.

29:29.160 --> 29:32.243
You are not stupid, Daniel. Nor am I.

29:32.239 --> 29:35.111
He doesn't know for sure
you're on this planet,...

29:35.118 --> 29:38.072
- ...let alone in this base.
- He is Goa'uld.

29:38.077 --> 29:40.282
He will find me. It's what he does.

29:40.316 --> 29:45.606
Letting me go, trusting me,
is the only chance of saving Samantha.

29:45.515 --> 29:48.135
Then I'm sorry.

29:53.191 --> 29:55.230
I'm sorry, Sam.

29:57.710 --> 30:01.921
Alive I can be a powerful ally.
Dead I am useless to you.

30:01.866 --> 30:04.903
Then you'll have to give us
more than empty promises.

30:04.904 --> 30:06.695
I can give her back to you.

30:08.702 --> 30:10.911
We can't let you go.

30:10.942 --> 30:13.019
I'm not talking about Samantha.

30:14.623 --> 30:16.365
I'm talking about Sha're.

30:20.378 --> 30:22.420
I know where she is.

30:38.412 --> 30:39.609
Who are you?

30:39.691 --> 30:42.894
- John Adams.
- You're not John...

30:51.727 --> 30:55.509
Daniel, it's a ploy.
He's playing on your greatest weakness.

30:55.484 --> 30:59.530
That may be so. But this may be
the only chance we have to see Sam again.

30:59.483 --> 31:01.441
I believe Jolinar.

31:03.281 --> 31:05.523
He told me about this resistance.

31:05.560 --> 31:09.939
They're not like the Goa'uld.
They don't take hosts against their will.

31:09.881 --> 31:11.290
Right,...

31:11.358 --> 31:13.730
...like Carter and this Nasyan guy.

31:13.759 --> 31:16.297
No. He had no choice.
He wants to leave Carter.

31:16.317 --> 31:18.807
If they don't take hosts,
how do they survive?

31:19.434 --> 31:21.891
They take humans who are about to die,...

31:21.915 --> 31:25.248
...who choose to continue to live
and coexist with the Goa'uld.

31:25.233 --> 31:27.938
Jolinar says this can be
a rewarding relationship.

31:27.951 --> 31:31.285
<i>I'm sorry.
I know what this means to you.</i>

31:31.269 --> 31:33.974
<i>But I will never, never trust a Goa'uld.</i>

31:36.949 --> 31:37.944
Hammond.

31:42.425 --> 31:46.555
The first group of Nasyans
from the hospital have arrived.

31:51.022 --> 31:53.061
Go ahead, soldier.

31:55.579 --> 31:57.619
Uh-huh.

32:02.019 --> 32:04.344
What the hell's that thing?

32:05.576 --> 32:07.367
It's a ring.

32:09.575 --> 32:11.615
Want a closer look?

32:14.814 --> 32:16.853
Have a nice day, airman.

32:25.089 --> 32:26.548
Boys.

32:26.607 --> 32:28.646
As you were.

32:29.406 --> 32:31.529
There's really no need to worry.

32:31.567 --> 32:34.402
There'll be a team waiting for you
on the other side.

32:34.405 --> 32:36.445
<i>Chevron one encoded.</i>

32:49.480 --> 32:53.427
Control room. Sir, it's the infirmary.
They said it's important.

32:53.397 --> 32:55.519
Chevron five is engaged.

32:55.556 --> 32:57.133
Thank you.

32:57.194 --> 33:00.612
The driver of the truck
that delivered the Nasyans...

33:00.596 --> 33:03.798
...just reported to the infirmary.
Says he blacked out.

33:03.794 --> 33:07.540
Doesn't remember driving
from the hospital to the base at all.

33:09.390 --> 33:12.179
Hold up security camera 1-6 Delta, please.

33:17.387 --> 33:19.628
Teal'c, let's get down there.

33:19.666 --> 33:21.539
Chevron six is engaged.

33:22.786 --> 33:26.998
This is General Hammond.
Security to level 16, holding room Delta.

33:26.944 --> 33:29.518
Chevron seven is locked.

33:43.777 --> 33:48.320
<i>Interesting weapons
these humans use.</i>

33:56.530 --> 33:58.819
Kree shac, Jolinar.

34:00.090 --> 34:03.923
By decree of the Goa'uld System Lords,
you will die with dishonour...

34:03.890 --> 34:06.096
...by the power of the Harakash.

34:06.128 --> 34:07.752
<i>Hear this.</i>

34:07.807 --> 34:10.677
The days of the Goa'uld System Lords
are numbered.

34:10.686 --> 34:12.728
Tell them that I died with hope.

34:12.766 --> 34:15.849
My death only feeds the fire
that burns strong in the Tok'ra.

34:25.320 --> 34:26.317
Agh!

34:28.719 --> 34:30.757
<i>This way! This way!</i>

34:37.596 --> 34:40.264
She's dead. Let's go.

34:44.351 --> 34:47.222
Colonel!
The prisoner and two guards are dead!

34:54.668 --> 34:56.706
These two are dead.

34:56.748 --> 34:58.621
Sam! Sam!

34:59.427 --> 35:00.804
Sam!

35:00.867 --> 35:03.536
Teal'c, get a medical team down here!

35:03.545 --> 35:05.003
Come on, Sam.

35:08.663 --> 35:10.820
Let's get her on the table.

35:10.860 --> 35:13.981
I want an EKG and an EEG stat.

35:13.981 --> 35:17.016
OK, on my count. Three, two, one!

35:17.780 --> 35:20.235
- Good. Go! Where's my epi?
- Got it.

35:20.257 --> 35:22.297
One milligram.

35:22.775 --> 35:25.233
<i>Epi's in.</i>

35:27.376 --> 35:29.414
Thank you...

35:29.454 --> 35:32.538
...for everything your people
have done for us.

35:32.532 --> 35:36.150
- You're gonna be OK.
- I hope your friend will also be well.

35:36.132 --> 35:38.007
Pulse is erratic.

35:38.052 --> 35:41.585
We're getting feedback from the EEG.
What is this?

35:41.568 --> 35:43.193
Looks like interference.

35:43.248 --> 35:45.204
<i>- Two signals.
- Isolate them.</i>

35:45.248 --> 35:47.820
You're picking up brain waves
from the parasite.

36:07.478 --> 36:09.554
Hey, I know you.

36:11.717 --> 36:13.510
Oh, jeez.

36:13.556 --> 36:16.177
<i>Do not try to stop me
or I'll kill him.</i>

36:22.831 --> 36:24.456
Doc?

36:24.873 --> 36:28.206
I don't know.
I've never been in this situation before.

36:28.190 --> 36:31.938
The Goa'uld looks like it's dying
and taking Carter with it.

36:34.706 --> 36:38.159
<i>- Release him, and you won't be hurt.
- Turn it back on.</i>

36:38.146 --> 36:40.472
We can't do that. Let him go.

36:40.505 --> 36:43.126
Turn the gate back on now, or he dies.

36:46.143 --> 36:48.599
The parasite is still getting weaker.

36:48.623 --> 36:52.204
<i>Security alert. Intruder. Code red!</i>

36:52.900 --> 36:56.398
<i>Parasite energy level
is still falling!</i>

36:56.458 --> 36:58.498
- They won't let you go.
- Silence!

36:58.538 --> 37:00.161
Open the Stargate!

37:03.137 --> 37:06.552
Let's cardiovert one more time.
40 joules.

37:12.893 --> 37:14.932
I am sorry, Daniel Jackson.

37:30.246 --> 37:32.284
Are you injured?

37:32.324 --> 37:34.364
Dumb question!

37:34.402 --> 37:36.443
But thank you.

37:36.483 --> 37:37.943
I think.

37:38.003 --> 37:40.043
You are welcome.

37:40.083 --> 37:42.572
<i>Just don't ever do that again.</i>

37:45.239 --> 37:46.518
The parasite is dead.

37:53.717 --> 37:57.416
Try another milligram of epi.
Then prepare for defib.

37:59.952 --> 38:01.746
She's out of defib.

38:01.793 --> 38:04.034
She's got a pulse.

38:10.548 --> 38:12.588
Faint, but stable.

38:29.342 --> 38:31.380
You did it, Sam.

38:31.420 --> 38:32.452
You won.

38:39.298 --> 38:41.338
It wasn't me.

38:41.376 --> 38:42.704
Oh, yes, it was.

38:42.775 --> 38:45.148
You hung in there. You beat it.

38:46.974 --> 38:50.179
The Goa'uld gave its life for me.

38:50.173 --> 38:52.001
It saved me.

39:29.358 --> 39:32.228
Hey, Sam. How's it going tonight?

39:40.753 --> 39:42.793
She's still the same.

39:44.951 --> 39:48.947
Janet said that the Goa'uld left
after it died.

39:50.028 --> 39:52.697
That's right. Um...

39:52.708 --> 39:56.373
It... It died, and her body's absorbing it.

39:56.346 --> 39:58.918
She's the old Samantha Carter.

39:58.945 --> 40:01.695
Same person we've always known.

40:02.184 --> 40:05.766
Cassie, she's just a little sad right now.

40:07.021 --> 40:10.722
But I'll bet she cheers up
when she sees you.

40:12.500 --> 40:14.327
C'mon.

40:45.806 --> 40:47.963
Sam, it's me.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.621
You're going to be OK.
