00:02.305 --> 00:04.301
Hey, Salem,
when did you start painting?

00:04.469 --> 00:06.465
When no one would read
my screenplay.

00:06.634 --> 00:07.911
I need a creative outlet.

00:08.077 --> 00:11.281
Well, my background in this area
is pretty much limited to spin art,

00:11.443 --> 00:12.562
but I like what I see.

00:12.726 --> 00:15.930
Well, let's not forget my model.
She deserves some of the credit.

00:16.453 --> 00:19.578

I've gotta sneeze.

Oh, you can read a magazine, but you
didn't have time to read my screenplay.

00:49.480 --> 00:52.878
I got through volumes one and two,
but then it seemed to drift.

00:53.047 --> 00:55.282
This is <i>Enchanted By,</i>
the magazine for witches.

00:55.452 --> 00:57.573
Anything in there
about dating mortals?

00:57.736 --> 00:59.811
You'll do anything to work the fact
that you're dating

00:59.981 --> 01:01.498
into the conversation.

01:01.664 --> 01:02.736
That's not true.

01:02.907 --> 01:04.104
Has anyone seen my book bag?

01:04.269 --> 01:05.786
The guy I'm dating has books.

01:06.754 --> 01:09.228
Sabrina, I want you to check out
this month's <i>Enchanted By.</i>

There happen to be some
very edifying articles.

01:11.965 --> 01:13.322
"Nose Warts: How to Hide Them."

01:13.488 --> 01:15.210
Oh, good, it's got pictures.

01:15.372 --> 01:17.048
The guy I'm dating has a nose.

01:18.177 --> 01:19.580
Okay, I'll stop.

01:19.741 --> 01:22.466
I want you to read the bulletin
from the Witches' Council.

01:22.626 --> 01:24.667
They're advising witches
under the age of 21

01:24.831 --> 01:26.632
to refrain from charitable magic.

01:26.795 --> 01:28.995
Whew, relieved of the burden
of helping others.

01:29.159 --> 01:32.523
Charitable magic can have disastrous
long-term consequences.

01:32.687 --> 01:34.409
For instance,
the teenage witch in Ohio

01:34.570 --> 01:36.645
who zapped away
her best friend's acne.

01:36.815 --> 01:38.731
- How thoughtful.
- Seemed that way,

01:38.899 --> 01:39.891
but as it turns out,

01:40.061 --> 01:43.745
her best friend was destined
to one day discover a cure for acne.

01:43.909 --> 01:45.312
So now, no cure.

01:45.472 --> 01:47.628
And now,
instead of being a scientist,

01:47.797 --> 01:49.872
she'll be a smooth-faced wino.

01:50.041 --> 01:53.804
I'll add that to my list of 10,000 other
witch rules I'm supposed to follow.

01:53.969 --> 01:56.854
Would you mind terribly
if I asked for that in a crystal bowl?

01:57.015 --> 01:59.820
As an artist, I'm sensitive
about these things.

01:59.981 --> 02:02.022
Allow me.

02:35.132 --> 02:36.250
If it's about your hair,

02:36.415 --> 02:38.411
yes, it does look
like a woodland creature's home.

02:38.579 --> 02:39.936
Oh, yeah? Well, I

02:40.102 --> 02:42.302

those little fellows rent.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.795
That was great, Sabrina.

Look, I hate to put you
in the position of having to say no,

but my mom's always on me
about having a friend over for dinner,

off for 13 years,

02:59.301 --> 03:00.703

at the Birkhead house.

03:07.156 --> 03:08.148
Sounds like fun,

and it beats "throw out the
fuzzy food" night at my house.

a whole new world for me.

this God-given talent for material gain?

I just got fired for recommending
a heart patient loosen up and try lard.

19:21.915 --> 19:24.480
Well, what about Warren?
I mean, you seem happy.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.317
[IN HOARSE VOICE]
I found out the hard way:

19:26.484 --> 19:28.207
electrical sockets are not toys.

19:28.368 --> 19:31.812
If you ask me, our troubles started
about the time Valerie changed.

19:31.975 --> 19:33.618
Oh, but you're glad
she changed, right?

19:33.779 --> 19:36.664
Not at all.
We miss the old Valerie.

19:36.825 --> 19:38.821
But you didn't realise how much
until she changed,

19:38.989 --> 19:40.871
so you're really glad she changed.

19:41.033 --> 19:43.234
- No.
- I see.

19:43.398 --> 19:45.040
Okay, I know what
will liven things up.

19:45.202 --> 19:46.559
Let's play charades.

19:46.725 --> 19:47.956
- Now?
- Now?

19:48.128 --> 19:49.120
I'll go first.

19:49.290 --> 19:53.816
It's not the name of a book or a movie.
It's just a particular phrase, okay?

19:53.979 --> 19:55.861
- Small?
- Tiny?

19:56.024 --> 19:59.866
- Wee?
- Yes. Okay, "we." Next word.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.947
Oh, I've got it. Happy.

20:02.116 --> 20:04.875
Okay, "We're happy--"

20:05.603 --> 20:08.407
- Valerie?
- Okay, "We're happy Valerie."

20:08.569 --> 20:10.724
- We're almost done.
- Mom, Dad,

20:10.893 --> 20:12.809
I can't keep it a secret any longer.

20:12.978 --> 20:15.019
I've got magical powers. Watch.

20:18.108 --> 20:20.628
Valerie, you changed
Warren into a dingo.

20:20.793 --> 20:21.991
"Changed." You said "changed."

20:22.156 --> 20:24.882
You said,
"We're happy Valerie changed."

20:28.729 --> 20:31.694
Uh, did I just see
what I thought I saw?

20:31.856 --> 20:33.737
Of course not.
It's that crackpot diet of yours.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.340
You eat enough pastrami
and bear claws,

20:36.505 --> 20:38.022
you're gonna start seeing things.

20:38.188 --> 20:40.424
What--? What happened?
How did I get here?

20:40.593 --> 20:43.067
You seemed to believe
you had magical powers, dear.

20:43.238 --> 20:46.876
You tried to change Warren
into a dingo.

20:47.046 --> 20:49.327
I did? I am such a loser.

20:49.491 --> 20:50.643
[CRYING]

20:50.814 --> 20:53.858
Oh, our baby, she's back.

20:58.750 --> 21:00.267
SABRINA: That's all?
- Yes.

21:00.433 --> 21:02.394
You've gotta read
and chronologically organise

21:02.557 --> 21:05.122
all of your aunt Zelda's
<i>Enchanted By</i> magazines.

21:05.283 --> 21:06.845
Then we'll consider the matter settled.

21:07.006 --> 21:09.047
And to make sure you actually
read and don't skim,

21:09.211 --> 21:11.366
there will be a quiz
when you're done.

21:11.535 --> 21:12.527
Fine by me.

21:12.698 --> 21:14.294
As a frequent victim
of your punishments,

21:14.461 --> 21:16.023
I'd say you guys are getting soft.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.018
SABRINA:
Whoa.

21:18.189 --> 21:21.073
Did I mention that I've been
a loyal <i>Enchanted By</i> subscriber

21:21.235 --> 21:23.549
for over 375 years?

21:23.720 --> 21:25.076
Believe it or not, this is nothing

21:25.243 --> 21:26.839
compared to the <i>International Male</i>

21:27.006 --> 21:28.568
she's got stacked in the basement.

21:28.730 --> 21:29.848
This is child abuse.

21:30.012 --> 21:31.735
Do you know how many
paper cuts I could get?

21:31.896 --> 21:33.812
SALEM:
You think you've got it bad?

21:34.541 --> 21:36.697
And I'm supposed
to be on my honeymoon.

21:36.866 --> 21:38.383
