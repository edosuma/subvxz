you're one of the better

00:23.170 --> 00:25.080

Not to worry
about the fish.

01:17.290 --> 01:20.960
You should, however,

Turtleneck Guy?

-Is everything okay?
-Yeah. I just need to study.

-Oh, go. Study hard.

Uh, I just wanted to say,
I am a huge fan.

03:16.620 --> 03:17.620
Oh, please.

03:17.620 --> 03:19.670
Seriously?
I don't do autographs.

03:19.670 --> 03:21.540
Uh, no not-- I just--

03:21.540 --> 03:24.000
Well, I just wanted to make sure
you're enjoying your meal.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.790
(groans) You're one of those.

03:25.790 --> 03:28.620
Look, dear, sometimes I must
choke down pedestrian swill

03:28.620 --> 03:29.790
as simple body fuel.

03:29.790 --> 03:32.500
Preferably, accompanied
by peace and quiet.

On our way.
What's going on?

03:41.500 --> 03:43.000
Go Go:
Krei ate some bad sushi.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.710
You will be okay.

03:44.710 --> 03:46.500
But while the antidote
takes effect,

03:46.500 --> 03:49.920
your major motor systems
will be significantly impaired.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.040
No kidding.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.460
Try to stay relaxed.

03:52.460 --> 03:53.580
I will rub your back.

No, g--
Ah, that's actually nice.

03:57.420 --> 03:58.460
What did she steal?

03:58.460 --> 04:01.330
That's-- oh-- classified.
It's top secret.

04:03.330 --> 04:04.710
Gravitational disrupter.

04:04.710 --> 04:06.080
An anti-grav device?

04:06.080 --> 04:07.880
-And you lost it?
-This is bad.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.210
Don't worry, she only made off
with half of my prototype.

04:10.210 --> 04:12.750
The other half is still secure
in my other secret safe.

04:12.750 --> 04:14.580
Where's your other
secret safe?

04:14.580 --> 04:16.710
I'm not telling you
and you'll never find it.

04:16.710 --> 04:18.580
Found it!
These days,

04:18.580 --> 04:20.170
the only reason
people have globes

04:20.170 --> 04:21.330
is to open secret safes.

04:21.330 --> 04:22.880
I mean, it's pretty obvious.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.580
You better not
tell anyone that's there.

04:26.580 --> 04:27.620
Pinky promise.

you were going upstairs

I'm in your room

like a study group.

05:00.710 --> 05:02.330
Yeah, a "study group."

05:02.330 --> 05:04.620
Oh, uh, yeah,
we're making flash cards,

05:04.620 --> 05:07.080
quizzing each other,
eating healthy snacks.

05:07.080 --> 05:08.580
-(clattering)
-Seriously,

05:08.580 --> 05:10.830
is there anything in this room
she didn't cut in half?

05:10.830 --> 05:12.000
Aunt Cass:
Who cut what in half?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.750
Go Go, so we can share
those healthy snacks.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.420

Now the numbness wears off.

05:18.710 --> 05:19.920
Hiro, what's going on?

05:19.920 --> 05:21.170
I'm almost done.
See you in a bit.

05:21.170 --> 05:22.290
Don't wait up.
Love you, bye.

05:22.290 --> 05:23.710
What are you going to do?

05:23.710 --> 05:25.920
Hey! Haha! I can stand.

05:26.920 --> 05:28.040
Oh.

05:33.120 --> 05:34.830
Bot fighting!

05:34.830 --> 05:37.620
What is he thinking
going to Good Luck Alley
at night?

05:37.620 --> 05:39.670
Wait. Wait, what am I thinking?

05:41.620 --> 05:42.790
I'm not going unarmed.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.580
Wasabi:
I've never seen
a cut like this.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.790
Not even my plasma blades
are this precise.

05:48.790 --> 05:51.670
-What?
-Graphene blades.

05:51.670 --> 05:53.710
Thinner than paper
but stronger than steel.

05:53.710 --> 05:55.880
This tech is cutting edge.

05:55.880 --> 05:57.380
No pun intended.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.380
Okay, okay.
Pun intended.

06:00.380 --> 06:02.290
-(keyboard clacks)
-Whoa, her knife is so thin,

06:02.290 --> 06:04.330
you can't even see it
from this angle.

06:04.330 --> 06:05.710
I told you
it was amazing.

06:05.710 --> 06:07.290
Baymax, can you
put a name to that face?

06:07.290 --> 06:08.920
I do not have
any information

06:08.920 --> 06:10.040
about that face.

06:10.040 --> 06:11.790
Good thing I do.

06:11.790 --> 06:14.750
My dad has a state-of-the-art

07:34.750 --> 07:36.420
Hi, everyone.

This is no-holds-barred cooking.

Cheating?
It's not only allowed...

...it's encouraged.

07:45.380 --> 07:46.420

07:46.420 --> 07:47.920
Are you prepared
to cook dirty?

07:47.920 --> 07:49.210
That does not sound sanitary.

07:49.210 --> 07:51.880
Spoken like someone
who's about to lose.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.830
And now,
your opponent,

07:53.830 --> 07:56.330
a man who needs
no introduction,

07:56.330 --> 07:59.420
Bolton Gramercy!

from the café today.

08:04.710 --> 08:05.920

08:05.920 --> 08:07.880
Um, well, I didn't actually
mean to enter.

08:07.880 --> 08:09.710
I'm just here

08:09.710 --> 08:11.710
So I'm gonna--
(clicks tongue)
you know...

08:11.710 --> 08:14.000
Give up. Good move.
Leave the cooking
to the real chefs.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.170

08:16.170 --> 08:19.580
Oh, we'll see
who's the real chef.

08:19.580 --> 08:22.000
You're about to get
stir-fried.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.120
Audience: Ooh!

08:23.120 --> 08:25.250
Fiesty.
Time to cook!

08:27.540 --> 08:30.960
Tonight's challenge:
the perfect crème brûlée.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.290
Oh, I can do that.

08:32.290 --> 08:33.540
But you must use

08:33.540 --> 08:34.750
gummy iguanas,

08:34.750 --> 08:36.000
cilantro,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.920
and an ostrich egg.

08:38.920 --> 08:40.670
-What?
-(laughs)

08:40.670 --> 08:43.460
-Let the food fight begin!
-(buzzer)

08:48.580 --> 08:50.500
You said it was
state-of-the-art.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.920
Well, it was in 1972.

08:52.920 --> 08:56.080
But don't worry,
my dad keeps the data
totally up-to-date.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.710
Punch cards, really?

08:57.710 --> 09:01.420
Yes, hello, but look at them,
they're up-to-date punch cards.

09:01.420 --> 09:02.710
Okay, let's get started.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.880
Whoa! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:04.880 --> 09:07.120
First, we have to let
the tubes warm up.

09:09.830 --> 09:11.880
Guess what guys?
It's punch card time.

09:11.880 --> 09:12.830
Boom.

09:25.710 --> 09:28.330

we have a match.

09:31.290 --> 09:34.420

I didn't think that was within
the realm of possibility.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.250
Present your knives
to the victor, you hack.

10:51.250 --> 10:53.460
But these knives
were a gift from my nana.

10:53.460 --> 10:54.580
To the victor...

10:54.580 --> 10:55.880
Audience:
Go the knives!

10:57.120 --> 10:59.420
Oh. No, that's
not really necessary.

10:59.420 --> 11:02.080
I don't make the rules,
I just enforce them.

11:02.080 --> 11:04.080
Take the knives.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.420
Sorry.

11:05.420 --> 11:06.920
Audience:
Cass! Cass!

11:06.920 --> 11:10.460
(audience cheers)

11:12.620 --> 11:14.540
You have
the gravitational disrupter?

11:14.540 --> 11:15.960
I have acquired it.

11:19.460 --> 11:21.080
This is only half of the device.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.790
You expect me to pay you
for only stealing half?

11:23.790 --> 11:26.380
You hired me to get
the device in Krei's safe,

11:26.380 --> 11:28.000
this is what was in his safe.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.620
So, yes.

11:29.620 --> 11:31.210
I expect to be paid.

11:31.210 --> 11:33.120
This is useless to me
without the other half.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.790
Then I guess you need
to hire me to steal
the other half.

11:35.790 --> 11:37.830
(growls) Fine.

11:37.830 --> 11:39.710
When you have
the whole device,
let me know.

11:41.120 --> 11:45.040
I will. Maybe I'll let
some other buyers know as well.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.330
Okay, I'm gonna need
a good story.

11:48.330 --> 11:50.000
Aunt Cass
is not gonna be happy.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.330
Honesty has been shown to have
significant health benefits.

11:53.330 --> 11:55.000
Not in this case.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.380
Aunt Cass, I'm home.

11:56.380 --> 11:58.500
I do not see Aunt Cass.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.960
Perhaps she has gone to bed.

11:59.960 --> 12:01.080
Aunt Cass?

12:01.080 --> 12:02.080
(whispers): Aunt Cass?

12:02.080 --> 12:04.170
-Scanning.
-(beeps)

12:04.170 --> 12:06.380
(purring)

12:06.380 --> 12:08.380
Baymax:
Aunt Cass is not here.

12:08.380 --> 12:11.620
Oh, no. She must have
gone out to look for me.
She could be anywhere.

12:11.620 --> 12:13.250
Baymax, suit up.
We gotta find her.

12:13.250 --> 12:15.170
Oh, Hiro. Hi.

12:15.170 --> 12:18.250
Hi. Wait, you were out?

12:18.250 --> 12:19.540
Um, yes.

12:19.540 --> 12:21.040
Doesn't seem like a big deal.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.210
Do you have
any idea what time it is?

12:23.210 --> 12:24.670
You scared me half to death.

12:24.670 --> 12:27.210
You are in good
physical condition.

12:27.210 --> 12:31.580
Your approximation
of a 50% proximity to death
is inaccurate.

12:31.580 --> 12:33.040
Yeah, so don't be so dramatic.

12:33.040 --> 12:34.210
-I just took a night off, okay?
-(meows)

12:34.210 --> 12:35.420
You didn't even
leave a note.

12:35.420 --> 12:36.750
Hiro:
Where were you?

12:36.750 --> 12:38.170
And why do you
smell like gummy fish?

12:38.170 --> 12:40.460
Aunt Cass:
I don't. I smell like
gummy iguanas.

12:40.460 --> 12:43.120
Now, it's late,
so I am going to bed.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.080
Hiro: No,
we're going to talk now.

12:45.080 --> 12:48.540
(sighs) Fine. Tell me all about
your robot-building study group.

12:48.540 --> 12:50.330
(yawns) You know,
it's pretty late.

12:50.330 --> 12:51.750
Let's pick this
up tomorrow.

12:51.750 --> 12:53.120
Works for me.
Good night, guys.

12:53.120 --> 12:56.080
Shall I set an alarm
for picking this up tomorrow?

12:56.080 --> 12:57.330
Both:
No.

12:57.330 --> 12:59.210
(meows, purrs)

13:05.250 --> 13:08.670
Wow. Gramercy's nana
had good taste in knives.

13:08.670 --> 13:10.210
Hey, Aunt Cass.

13:10.210 --> 13:11.790
I, uh, I have
another study group tonight,

13:11.790 --> 13:14.000
so don't worry about me
for dinner. Bye.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.080
Bye, Hiro.

13:15.080 --> 13:17.880
Guess I've got
tonight to myself.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.170
(grunts)

13:37.170 --> 13:38.710
Hey there,
looking for something?

13:38.710 --> 13:40.250
Well, this is cute.

13:40.250 --> 13:42.000
You really think
you can stop me?

13:43.000 --> 13:44.250
(grunting)

13:46.670 --> 13:48.750
Knives can be dangerous,

13:48.750 --> 13:50.330
especially when thrown.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.250
Aw, see? He gets me.

13:57.210 --> 13:58.620
Oh, no.

14:00.420 --> 14:01.500
Huh?

14:02.710 --> 14:03.790
What?

14:05.710 --> 14:06.830
Uh-oh.

14:06.830 --> 14:09.250
(grunting)

14:10.790 --> 14:12.210
Ha! Missed.

14:12.210 --> 14:13.250
Did I?

14:14.120 --> 14:16.460
Lady, you're going down.

14:16.460 --> 14:19.330
(both grunting)

14:19.330 --> 14:21.580
So the knives,
graphene, right?

14:21.580 --> 14:23.210
You can tell me,
it's kind of my thing.

14:23.210 --> 14:25.380
Yes. Want a close look?

14:25.380 --> 14:26.750
(chuckles feebly)

14:27.750 --> 14:28.830
Ha!

14:28.830 --> 14:31.000
Huh? Aah!

14:31.000 --> 14:34.250
Huh! You boys lasted
three seconds longer
than I would have thought.

14:34.250 --> 14:35.670
Impressive.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.790
-Huh? Huh.
-Huh? Huh?

14:39.790 --> 14:42.250
Now she can mess with gravity.

14:42.250 --> 14:44.420
We have to get it back
before someone gets hurt.

14:44.420 --> 14:47.040
Okay, but that was so cool.

14:52.920 --> 14:54.210
(dramatic music plays)

15:14.120 --> 15:15.250
(dramatic music continuing)

15:27.170 --> 15:30.290
Audience:
Cass! Cass! Cass! Cass! Cass!

15:34.750 --> 15:36.080
Not again.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.250
(snoring)

15:37.250 --> 15:39.040
-Baymax: Good morning,
Aunt Cass.
-What?

15:39.040 --> 15:40.880
Ooh!
What time is it?

15:40.880 --> 15:43.080
8:45.
The café should be open.

15:43.080 --> 15:45.120
Who are you and what
have you done with my Aunt Cass?

15:45.120 --> 15:48.210
Oh, relax, they can wait
an extra few minutes
for their coffee.

15:48.210 --> 15:50.540
Hiro: What's going on?
You're supposed to be
the responsible one.

15:50.540 --> 15:53.420
Aunt Cass: There's nothing wrong
with going out once in a while
to cut loose.

15:53.420 --> 15:56.170
"Cut loose"?
What are you doing all night?
Where do you go?

15:56.170 --> 15:58.250
Uh, the movies.
Gotta go to work.

15:58.250 --> 16:02.290
She has no idea what it's like
to deal with someone who is
obviously lying to you.

16:02.290 --> 16:04.380
(meows)

16:11.380 --> 16:13.710
♪ ♪

16:13.710 --> 16:15.500
What's she doing
in Good Luck Alley?

16:15.500 --> 16:16.830
This place is dangerous.

16:18.330 --> 16:19.750
(dog barking in distance)

16:19.750 --> 16:21.120
What?

16:21.120 --> 16:22.380
(grunts)

16:24.580 --> 16:27.080
What is going on?

16:27.080 --> 16:28.540
I assume you got the device.

16:28.540 --> 16:30.120
The whole thing this time.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.290
Was it ever in doubt?

16:31.290 --> 16:33.080
One anti-grav device

16:33.080 --> 16:35.290
with a 70-meter-range radius.

16:35.290 --> 16:37.460
Fine, I will
pay you double.

16:37.460 --> 16:39.790
Actually, things have changed.

16:39.790 --> 16:42.420
I'm selling it
on the black market
to the highest bidder.

16:42.420 --> 16:44.710
-(beeps)
-Why you--

16:45.710 --> 16:47.290
(choking) What the--

16:47.290 --> 16:48.710
(groans)

16:48.710 --> 16:50.620
Oh, delicious, isn't it?

16:50.620 --> 16:53.420
The toxin gives it a real kick.

16:53.420 --> 16:55.960
-Ah!
-Take him home,
then get him the antidote,

16:55.960 --> 16:57.620
eventually.

16:57.620 --> 16:59.420
-(audience cheers and applauds)
-Who's that down there?

16:59.420 --> 17:01.460
New fighter, undefeated.

17:01.460 --> 17:05.380
Not for long.

17:06.380 --> 17:09.170
I detect Aunt Cass
in the spotlight.

17:09.170 --> 17:11.000
Hey, Aunt Cass!
Aunt Cass!

17:11.000 --> 17:12.500
Hiro, what are you
doing here?

17:12.500 --> 17:14.620
-What are you doing here?
-Um, winning.

17:14.620 --> 17:17.500
And now, back in the ring
to defend her title,

17:17.500 --> 17:19.620
you know her
as reigning champion

17:19.620 --> 17:21.540
Momakase!

17:21.540 --> 17:23.500
-Momakase.
-Oh, I've heard she's good.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.710
No, she's bad. Really bad.

17:25.710 --> 17:27.040
You've gotta get out of here.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.790
I will, Hiro. Just as soon as
I crush her and take her knives.

17:29.790 --> 17:31.540
No, wait! You don't want
to get near her knives.

17:31.540 --> 17:33.710
Hey, it's inappropriate to mess
with the fighters.

17:33.710 --> 17:34.750
(Hiro shouts)

17:34.750 --> 17:36.750
(grunts)

17:36.750 --> 17:38.380
-Oh, no.
-(Hiro groans)

17:38.380 --> 17:40.830
(Hiro grunting)

17:40.830 --> 17:43.120
Go Go, I found
Momakase

17:43.120 --> 17:45.380
and you are not
gonna believe this.

17:45.380 --> 17:48.000
Hm, let me guess.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.080
A cook at some nothing café?

17:50.080 --> 17:53.460
You probably put
cute animal faces
in your cappuccino foam.

17:53.460 --> 17:56.500
You wish you could make
a panda-ccino like mine.

17:56.500 --> 17:58.500
Tonight's
championship challenge:

17:58.500 --> 18:00.460
speed sushi.

18:00.460 --> 18:02.420
-Audience: Ooh!
-Sharpen your knife skills,
chefs.

18:02.420 --> 18:04.040
This could get dangerous.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.040
(audience cheers)

18:06.080 --> 18:07.120
Oof!

18:07.120 --> 18:09.790
Okay, fine. You are going down.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.580
Whoa! I never knew

18:12.580 --> 18:13.960
cooking could be so tense.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.080
I am never gonna look

18:15.080 --> 18:16.170
at a sandwich the same way.

18:16.170 --> 18:18.210
Baymax, scan the building
for the gravity thing.

18:18.210 --> 18:20.040
(beeping)

18:21.170 --> 18:23.120
Baymax:
Gravity disrupter, located.

18:23.120 --> 18:24.330
Let's go.

18:31.710 --> 18:32.960
(grunts)

18:46.210 --> 18:48.210
It is in this room.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.580
Nice. This is gonna
be easier than I thought.

18:51.620 --> 18:53.710
Oh... hi.

18:56.670 --> 18:57.880
You are not as good

18:57.880 --> 18:58.960
as you think you are.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.500
Just have to be better
than you.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.380
Huh, we'll see about that.

19:03.380 --> 19:04.460
What?

19:07.250 --> 19:08.540
(groans)

19:08.540 --> 19:10.540
-(audience gasps)
-Oof, this looks bad for Cass.

19:10.540 --> 19:13.620
She needs to get her dish
to the judges before
time runs out to qualify.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.460
I'll be back
to collect your knives.

19:15.460 --> 19:17.830
Why is there even
a net in here?

19:21.460 --> 19:24.460
They're no graphene blades,
but they do the trick
just fine.

19:24.460 --> 19:26.460
That is mine!

19:26.460 --> 19:27.710
Really? 'Cause you stole it.

19:27.710 --> 19:29.460
So you really shouldn't
be that offended

19:29.460 --> 19:31.250
'cause, you know,
it's not yours and all.

19:32.710 --> 19:34.330
Oof!

19:34.330 --> 19:36.330
I'm okay!

19:38.670 --> 19:39.670
(grunts)

19:41.920 --> 19:43.920
Ah! (groans)

19:48.580 --> 19:50.500
Wasabi, look out!

19:50.500 --> 19:51.830
(grunting)

19:57.040 --> 19:59.710
It really works!

19:59.710 --> 20:00.960
It really works!

20:00.960 --> 20:02.580
Whoa, cool.

20:02.580 --> 20:04.420
Audience:
Ten, nine, eight...

20:04.420 --> 20:06.080
I guess you can't
win them all.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.420
I take it back.

20:12.670 --> 20:14.210
You can win them all.

20:15.330 --> 20:16.500
(buzzer)

20:16.500 --> 20:17.960
She did it!
(laughs)

20:17.960 --> 20:19.710
It's all over now
but the judging.

20:19.710 --> 20:20.710
-And the floating.
-(glass shatters)

20:23.120 --> 20:25.040
I won? Oh, I won!

20:25.040 --> 20:26.500
Oh! (grunts)

20:28.080 --> 20:29.380
Aunt Cass!

20:32.080 --> 20:33.540
(grunting)

20:33.540 --> 20:35.920
Everyone, hold on,
things are about to get heavy.

20:38.670 --> 20:40.080
(grunts)

20:41.620 --> 20:42.830
Whoa!

20:44.080 --> 20:46.750
Audience (chanting):
Cass, Cass, Cass, Cass, Cass!

20:46.750 --> 20:48.540
(chanting and cheers
continues)

20:48.540 --> 20:50.620
(grunting)

20:51.620 --> 20:53.380
Nobody steals
from Alistair Krei

20:53.380 --> 20:55.080
and gets away with it.

20:55.080 --> 20:57.170
And nobody tells
Alistair Krei how much
soy sauce to use.

20:57.170 --> 21:00.960
Wow, can you believe that woman
was a dangerous criminal?

21:00.960 --> 21:02.500
And you stood up to her.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.120
Sometimes I forget
how amazing you are.

21:04.120 --> 21:05.710
Oh.

21:05.710 --> 21:07.040
Thanks, Hiro.

21:08.460 --> 21:10.420
Chef Gramercy,
what are you doing here?

21:10.420 --> 21:11.880
Uh, hello, Cass.

21:11.880 --> 21:13.620
I should say
Chef Cass.

21:13.620 --> 21:16.330
First of all,
I want to apologize
for my atrocious behavior.

21:16.330 --> 21:18.670
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.

21:18.670 --> 21:22.290
Secondly, I was wondering if--
if you could find it
in your heart--

21:22.290 --> 21:23.960
You want
your nana's knives back.

21:31.500 --> 21:32.670
Uh...

21:32.670 --> 21:34.960
So, which ones
are your nana's?

21:37.330 --> 21:38.880
(theme music playing)
