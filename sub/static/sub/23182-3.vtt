00:10.509 --> 00:13.275
You were chorin' with
your pals the other day.

00:13.309 --> 00:14.709
(BLOWING NOSE)

00:17.742 --> 00:19.409
Don't be
a fuckin' degen, Dary.

00:19.442 --> 00:20.575
What?

00:20.609 --> 00:21.809
Well, every time
you snot rocket...

00:21.842 --> 00:23.442
Or farmer spit...

00:23.475 --> 00:25.342
You lick your lips after,
and it's fuckin' gross.

00:25.375 --> 00:26.909
You act like yous got it all
your damn self.

00:26.942 --> 00:29.175
I'm not a fuckin' snot licker,
that's for GD sure.

00:29.209 --> 00:30.442
The last time I checked,

00:30.475 --> 00:31.375
nothin' up there
that can't hurt me.

00:31.409 --> 00:32.875
Incorrect, big shooters.

00:32.909 --> 00:35.509
Snots is actually your body's
garbage removal system.

00:35.542 --> 00:37.275
When you breathe in,
your nose hairs collects

00:37.309 --> 00:38.909
all sorts of dusts and debris,

00:38.942 --> 00:41.309
including bacterias
and viruses.

00:41.342 --> 00:43.509
That's your body's way of
removing them from you.

00:43.542 --> 00:44.775
That's what snots is.

00:44.809 --> 00:46.909
Dust and debris
and viruses and what?

00:46.942 --> 00:48.742
Figure it out.

00:48.775 --> 00:51.442
You're getting rid of that
dust and debris intranasallys

00:51.475 --> 00:53.509
and then you just takes it
right back in orally.

00:53.542 --> 00:54.709
Well, youse can
both take it anally,

00:54.742 --> 00:56.142
that's all I give
a care about.

00:56.175 --> 00:57.175
You better settle
down over there,

00:57.209 --> 00:58.375
or I'm gonna come talk to you.

00:58.409 --> 00:59.675
Speaking of
taking things anallys...

00:59.709 --> 01:00.775
Moving on.

01:00.809 --> 01:02.409
‐I gots a question.
‐Nope.

01:02.442 --> 01:04.209
It's of the personal varietys.

01:04.242 --> 01:05.642
There's such a thing as
too much butt talk,

01:05.675 --> 01:07.275
and a fella oughta be
fuckin' aware of it.

01:07.309 --> 01:08.509
Well, youse guys
are my friends.

01:08.542 --> 01:10.375
I relys on you for counsel.

01:10.409 --> 01:12.609
I gots a problem
and I need my friends.

01:12.642 --> 01:14.109
If a man asks for help,
you help him.

01:15.509 --> 01:16.642
Pitter‐patter.

01:16.675 --> 01:18.309
Youse guys remembers that gal

01:18.342 --> 01:19.842
I took to the chip trucks
last summer?

01:19.875 --> 01:21.475
Fuck's sake.

01:21.509 --> 01:22.675
(CHUCKLES )The one who put
her finger in your bum?

01:22.709 --> 01:23.675
Mind your
fuckin' beeswax, Dary.

01:23.709 --> 01:25.142
That's the one, Dary.

01:25.175 --> 01:26.709
It's impolite
to kiss and tell, Dan.

01:26.742 --> 01:28.175
Well, I knows it's impolites
to kiss and tells, but...

01:28.209 --> 01:29.509
No butts.

01:29.542 --> 01:31.775
Actually, this involves
a significant butt.

01:31.809 --> 01:33.209
Hers or yours?

01:33.242 --> 01:35.642
I'm gonna take a fuckin'
migraine here.

01:35.675 --> 01:40.275
Anyways, she was
askings me about...

01:44.275 --> 01:47.409
Performings the anal sex
on her.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.575
Youse guys...

01:51.609 --> 01:53.175
Youse guys ever do that?

01:53.775 --> 01:55.275
You ever...

01:56.675 --> 01:58.309
Takes the dirt road home?

01:59.342 --> 02:02.375
‐No.
‐No.

02:02.409 --> 02:05.209
Well, Professor Tricia from
my women's studies group,

02:05.242 --> 02:07.709
she says
it's quite commons to...

02:09.242 --> 02:12.175
Enter through
the back door. Uh...

02:12.209 --> 02:14.475
Mind you she didn't stress
whethers that was naturals...

02:14.509 --> 02:16.909
Well, but, like I've been
told, that where vagina sex

02:16.942 --> 02:20.209
is like a total encasing
of the penis, like...

02:20.242 --> 02:22.875
Like sticking a hot dog
inside a pogo,

02:22.909 --> 02:25.309
and then like, anal sex is a
partial encasing of the penis,

02:25.342 --> 02:27.242
so it'd be more like

02:27.275 --> 02:28.609
putting a hot dog
in a beer bottle.

02:28.642 --> 02:30.275
‐Waynes?
‐No.

02:30.309 --> 02:32.275
‐Dary?
‐The answer's still no.

02:32.309 --> 02:34.675
But I have been told
the same thing as Dary,

02:34.709 --> 02:36.775
that whereas vagina sex
provides stimulation

02:36.809 --> 02:38.442
of the entire penis,

02:38.475 --> 02:40.775
like a sausage
inside a burrito,

02:40.809 --> 02:44.475
but bum sex provides
stimulation only from like...

02:44.509 --> 02:46.775
Well, like the rim
of the butt hole

02:46.809 --> 02:48.875
rather than inside
the butt hole also.

02:48.909 --> 02:50.675
So, what you're sayings is,

02:50.709 --> 02:54.909
it's less like going inside
this Long John Silvers here,

02:54.942 --> 02:58.509
and more like going inside
this honey cruller here.

02:58.542 --> 03:01.709
Correct. It's less like going
inside this loaf of bread...

03:03.942 --> 03:05.509
And more like going
inside this bagel.

03:05.542 --> 03:07.709
‐Waynes?
‐No.

03:07.742 --> 03:09.475
‐Dary?
‐Answer's still no.

03:09.509 --> 03:11.542
But I have been told that
it's less like going inside

03:11.575 --> 03:13.442
this wheel of Brie cheese

03:13.475 --> 03:15.909
and more like going inside
this piece of Swiss cheese.

03:15.942 --> 03:18.642
Oh, I love Swiss cheese.

03:18.675 --> 03:20.642
I love honey crullers.

03:20.675 --> 03:22.909
You don't like bagels.

03:22.942 --> 03:24.342
Nope.

03:24.375 --> 03:26.375

(SIGHS) I need to borrow
your truck, big brother.

03:43.209 --> 03:44.442
What for?

03:44.475 --> 03:45.509
To take these two
back to the city.

03:45.542 --> 03:46.909
‐For good?
‐Yeah.

03:46.942 --> 03:48.742
(KEYS RATTLE)

03:48.775 --> 03:50.809
Why youse taking them back
to the city, Katy?

03:50.842 --> 03:52.142
Why don't you ask them?

03:52.175 --> 03:55.475
Okay. Shep. Kingsley,

03:55.509 --> 03:57.542
why is Katy's taking you backs
to the citys?

03:57.575 --> 03:59.875
Probably 'cause
we're big fat tubs of lard.

03:59.909 --> 04:02.442
It's 'cause we're too tubby.

04:02.475 --> 04:03.742
Does that answer
your question, Dan?

04:03.775 --> 04:05.242
Gotcha.

04:05.275 --> 04:06.575
If I was
a supporting character

04:06.609 --> 04:08.842
in a Tom Hanks movie,
I'd be Tubba Gump.

04:08.875 --> 04:10.509
Oh, sure, sure.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.509
And if youse were an early
Jake Gyllenhaal film,

04:12.542 --> 04:14.342
you'd be Tubble Boy.

If I was a career resurrecting
Matthew McConaughey vehicle,

04:17.309 --> 04:19.175
I'd be Dallas Buyers Tub.

04:19.209 --> 04:20.809
Exactly.

04:20.842 --> 04:22.475
And if you were an Original
NES two‐player fighting game,

04:22.509 --> 04:23.809
you'd be Tubble‐Dragon.

sort of bar in this town.

needs a hand getting set up.

Mmm. What's Jivin' to do now?

Jivin' a good guy anymore.

the street uptown.

05:02.475 --> 05:03.842
Jivin' shouldn't
have done that.

Jivin' laughed at her, too,
when she jumped.

Jivin's pals
shouldn't have done that.

05:14.709 --> 05:16.909
Jivin' and his pals thinks
so much of themselves

05:16.942 --> 05:19.242

suck each other off.

We'll go pick up
the kegs from Jivin's.

you're gonna come talk to him?

05:38.175 --> 05:40.275
I didn't ask
what you were, girl.

05:40.309 --> 05:42.309
I didn't tell you
what I am, boy.

‐I'm Gae.
‐So am I.

05:45.709 --> 05:47.409
No, you're not.

05:47.442 --> 05:48.909
(QUIVERING) That's exactly
what my father said to me.

05:48.942 --> 05:50.642
So you're in the business
of opening wounds, girl?

05:50.675 --> 05:52.509
Stop calling me girl, boy.

‐And what shall I call you?
‐Gae.

I support you, remember?

05:58.709 --> 06:01.242
Let me get this straight.
He's a homosexual?

06:01.275 --> 06:03.142
That's exactly what my mother
said to me.

06:03.175 --> 06:05.309
(CRYING) The exact same way.

06:05.342 --> 06:07.809
You will delete yourself
from this dwelling, girl.

06:07.842 --> 06:09.642
But not before
you reveal your motive

06:09.675 --> 06:11.742
behind your vexations streak!

06:11.775 --> 06:14.309
‐Fine.
‐And after that, huh,

06:14.342 --> 06:16.409
you better bizzounce!

never gave him a chance...

06:28.542 --> 06:30.309

06:33.909 --> 06:36.475
My parents banished me to
Letterkenny from the city

to live with my aunt
because of poor behavior.

‐I'm a deportee.

06:56.409 --> 07:01.242
ROALD: Dad...
Yup. Still a homo...

07:01.275 --> 07:02.875
But you're the one who
named me after the author of

Charlie and
the Chocolate Factory!

07:11.120 --> 07:13.687
‐Listen up, you pilons.
‐Grab a knee, plugs.

07:17.720 --> 07:19.120
All right. Now, I know

07:19.154 --> 07:20.887
you guys may
not want to hear this,

07:20.920 --> 07:22.320
but getting rid
of that puck bunny

07:22.354 --> 07:25.087
is the first step towards
getting a W, boys.

07:25.120 --> 07:26.687
We'll introduce you
to a couple of

07:26.720 --> 07:28.687
sporty little spices
down the road, boys.

07:28.720 --> 07:30.554
But I like that
sporty little spice.

07:31.654 --> 07:32.787
BOTH: Pardon?

07:32.820 --> 07:35.287
Sorry. Sorry, man, my bad.

07:35.320 --> 07:37.620
Boomtown!

07:37.654 --> 07:39.654
But I like that
sporty little spice!

07:39.687 --> 07:40.920
Okay.

07:40.954 --> 07:42.120
Well, you'd better
learn to hate her

07:42.154 --> 07:43.254
because she's
the reason we have

07:43.287 --> 07:45.187
zero W's on the season, boys.

07:45.220 --> 07:48.287
‐We need that W, boys.
‐Gotta have that W, boys.

07:48.320 --> 07:50.054
Gotta want that W, boys.

07:50.087 --> 07:51.987
And the first step
to getting it is...

07:52.020 --> 07:54.020
Beating your
opponent mentally.

07:54.054 --> 07:55.320
Gotta get inside
of his head, boys.

07:55.354 --> 07:58.154
Hockey is 90% mental,
10% skill.

07:58.187 --> 08:00.987
Unless you're a retired NHL
tough guy Basil McRae,

08:01.020 --> 08:05.154
who says hockey is 50% mental,
50% being mental.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.720
(SOFTLY) Still not sure
that's PC, buddy.

08:08.754 --> 08:11.120
No. Baz makes his
own rules, though, buddy.

08:11.154 --> 08:13.620
‐Love Baz, bro.
‐Baz for life, yo.

08:13.654 --> 08:15.654
(BOTH CLEAR THROAT)

08:15.687 --> 08:16.987
Now, the easiest way

08:17.020 --> 08:18.654
to get inside your
opponent's head, boys,

08:18.687 --> 08:20.220
is by chirping from the bench.

08:20.254 --> 08:21.754
Obviously, boys.

08:21.787 --> 08:23.720
Talk is for Schmelts,
you little bitch.

08:23.754 --> 08:25.820
Do your talking on
the scoreboard, schmelts.

08:25.854 --> 08:27.254
‐Oh. Oh, okay.
‐Hmm...

08:27.287 --> 08:29.187
Have any of you guys
been doing any talking

08:29.220 --> 08:30.887
on the scoreboards lately?

08:30.920 --> 08:34.720
‐Hey? Hmm?
‐Nice stats, no stats.

08:34.754 --> 08:36.620
Fine, you little bitch.

08:36.654 --> 08:37.920
We'll try it
your way, schmelts.

08:37.954 --> 08:39.187
BOTH: Good.

08:39.220 --> 08:41.654
Tonight, we will
be taking you boys

08:41.687 --> 08:44.187
through chirping
from the bench 101.

08:44.220 --> 08:48.020
‐We can get this W, boys.
‐We will get this W, boys.

08:52.354 --> 08:55.720
You're not gonna get this
W, boys, not by yourselves.

08:55.754 --> 08:58.320
But luckily for you pheasants,

08:58.354 --> 09:01.320
someone in this room
has got some jam.

09:01.354 --> 09:03.654
Ready to meet
your new teammate? Come on!

09:06.887 --> 09:08.820
(WATER RUNNING)

09:08.854 --> 09:10.354
Look at this tour de force.

09:10.387 --> 09:12.854
This piece de resistance.

09:12.887 --> 09:14.687
This masterpiece.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.054
‐Huh?
‐(GRUNTING SOFTLY)

09:16.087 --> 09:18.920
Look at that hustle.
Look at that jam.

09:18.954 --> 09:21.620
Multitasking, pheasants.

09:21.654 --> 09:25.920
Maxing every single second!

09:25.954 --> 09:28.054
That's how
you get the W, boys.

09:28.087 --> 09:29.754
SHORESY: Well, fuck, boys,
I was already down here

09:29.787 --> 09:31.854
ripping ass whilst
figured I'd rip some raps.

09:31.887 --> 09:33.687
What the fuck are you
looking at, tit fucker?

09:33.720 --> 09:35.654
‐Give your balls a tug.
‐Fuck you, Shoresy.

09:35.687 --> 09:37.720
Fuck you, Reily. Fight me,
see what happens.

09:37.754 --> 09:39.187
Yeah, what's gonna
happen, Shoresy?

09:39.220 --> 09:41.254
Three things, I hit you,
you hit the pavement,

09:41.287 --> 09:42.687
ambulance hits 60.

09:42.720 --> 09:43.687
That's the worst chirp
I've ever heard

09:43.720 --> 09:44.787
in my entire life, Shoresy.

09:44.820 --> 09:45.954
That's my slow‐learning

09:45.987 --> 09:47.787
Mennonite uncle's
favorite chirp.

09:47.820 --> 09:48.987
SHORESY: Yeah, it's your mom's
favorite chirp, too, buddy.

09:49.020 --> 09:50.254
Ask her, see what happens.

09:50.287 --> 09:51.887
Yeah?
What's gonna happen, Shoresy?

09:51.920 --> 09:53.920
Three things, I hit you,
you hit the pavement,

09:53.954 --> 09:55.120
I fuck your mom again.

09:55.154 --> 09:56.887
Fuck you, Shoresy.

09:56.920 --> 09:59.020
Fuck you, Jonesy. Your mom
just liked my Instagram post

09:59.054 --> 10:01.087
from two years ago
in Puerto Vallarta.

10:01.120 --> 10:02.787
Tell her I'll put
my swim trunks on for her

10:02.820 --> 10:04.220
anytime she likes.

10:04.254 --> 10:05.987
Fuck you, Shoresy!

10:06.020 --> 10:07.687
Fuck you, Reilly.

10:07.720 --> 10:08.887
Your mom keeps trying to slip
a finger in my bum,

10:08.920 --> 10:10.654
but I keep telling her
I only let

10:10.687 --> 10:12.620
Jonsey's mom do that,
you fuckin' loser.

10:12.654 --> 10:15.054
My mom would never put
a finger in your bum!

10:15.087 --> 10:16.720
Mum's a fuckin' saint. Fuck!

10:16.754 --> 10:18.720
Fuck your entire fuckin' life,
you piece of shit.

10:32.020 --> 10:33.054
Gail, how're ya now?

10:33.087 --> 10:34.720
‐Good, 'an you?
‐Not bad.

10:35.787 --> 10:37.754
ALL: To MoDean's 2!

10:40.387 --> 10:42.054
Ah.

10:42.087 --> 10:43.354
It's a hell of a space
you got.

10:43.387 --> 10:44.654
Thanks for the help, boys.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.354
You're welcome, Gails.

10:46.387 --> 10:48.320
Wasn't Jivin' Pete supposed
to deliver those himself?

10:48.354 --> 10:50.087
‐Yeah.
‐What happened with that?

10:50.120 --> 10:51.154
My cousin said
she seen him with

10:51.187 --> 10:52.787
some degens from up country.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.587
(GROWLS)

10:54.620 --> 10:57.654
Anywho, Old Gail's all sorts
of jazzed about MoDean's 2.

10:57.687 --> 10:59.020
So are we, Gails.

10:59.054 --> 11:01.020
I'm so jazzed
I couldn't sleep last night.

11:01.054 --> 11:04.020
I was up flickin' more bean
than a Starbucks barista.

11:04.054 --> 11:05.787
‐Good enough, Gail.
‐I mean it.

11:05.820 --> 11:07.854
Handled more dime
than a homeless man.

11:07.887 --> 11:10.154
‐Where do these go?
‐Back door...

11:10.187 --> 11:12.920
Where you know
you're always welcome, Wayne.

11:12.954 --> 11:14.954
‐Okay.
‐(OBJECT THUDS)

11:16.087 --> 11:17.287
There someone else here?

11:17.320 --> 11:19.154
Yeah. I hired
a couple waitresses.

11:19.887 --> 11:21.720
(MUSIC PLAYING)

11:25.854 --> 11:28.120
Oh...

11:28.154 --> 11:29.787
Bonnie McMurray.

11:38.354 --> 11:42.554
I thought you said there
was two, uh, waitresses.

11:57.220 --> 11:59.187
‐Glen?
‐Wayne!

11:59.220 --> 12:00.754
(CHUCKLES) Well,

12:00.787 --> 12:02.354
I guess the kitten's out
of the clutch, again.

12:02.387 --> 12:04.187
Glen's back to waitressing.

12:04.220 --> 12:05.920
Well, you look...

12:07.254 --> 12:09.754
‐Ordinary.
‐(EXCLAIMS)

12:09.787 --> 12:11.220
Did you hear that?
That's some hot praise coming

12:11.254 --> 12:13.120
from Mr. Extraordinary.
(CHUCKLES)

12:13.154 --> 12:14.654
Gave him a little makeover.

12:14.687 --> 12:16.054
Figured if you guys
get some eye candy,

12:16.087 --> 12:18.720
old Gail is gonna help
herself to a fistful too.

12:18.754 --> 12:20.920
Mmm.
Gail got me the Lasik so...

12:20.954 --> 12:21.954
(GROWLS)

12:23.287 --> 12:24.720
BOTH: Hi, Bonnie.

12:24.754 --> 12:26.220
‐Hi, Wayne.
‐How're ya now?

12:26.254 --> 12:27.654
Bonnie, kegs are coming in,

12:27.687 --> 12:29.187
so make sure
the lines are clean.

12:29.220 --> 12:31.720
Glen, go throw some ice
in the urinals.

12:31.754 --> 12:33.687
I know it's like a little
video game for you guys.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.054
Can confirm.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.320
BOTH: Bye, Bonnie.

12:36.354 --> 12:37.787
BOTH: Bye, Wayne.

12:37.820 --> 12:39.620
No, I was going
to say it first.

12:39.654 --> 12:42.020
You don't want to go
toe‐to‐toe with me, darlin'.

12:42.054 --> 12:43.320
Anyway, back to Jivin'.

12:43.354 --> 12:45.154
He's turned into
a bit of a tit, hasn't he?

12:45.187 --> 12:46.854
Yeah, his pals too.

12:46.887 --> 12:48.354
Well, if you've got something
to say about Jivin',

12:48.387 --> 12:49.787
you should
say it to his face.

12:49.820 --> 12:51.687
Bad gas travels
fast in a small town.

12:51.720 --> 12:54.187
You don't want him hearin'
that from somebody else.

12:54.220 --> 12:56.687
‐It's dishonorable.
‐It's a true story.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.920
Saddle up to the bar
when you're done.

12:58.954 --> 13:01.787
I'll show my new Haitian taco.

13:01.820 --> 13:03.620
Well, I don't know
if that's foods or not,

13:03.654 --> 13:05.620
but if it is,
I'm lookin' forward to it.

13:05.654 --> 13:06.787
It's only for Wayne.

13:06.820 --> 13:09.020
Well, then I guess
it's not foods.

13:09.054 --> 13:10.687
But I'm gonna pencil you
in for a chats, Gail,

13:10.720 --> 13:11.954
'cause Haitian tacos,

13:11.987 --> 13:13.087
that sounds like we got
something there.

13:16.320 --> 13:18.587
You guys remember when Jivin
was pissing down the hay mow

13:18.620 --> 13:19.820
and Alexander
was climbing up

13:19.854 --> 13:20.920
and he got a bit of pee
in his mouth?

13:20.954 --> 13:22.720
Enough talk about Jivin'.

13:22.754 --> 13:24.754
And then,
you remember the same night

13:24.787 --> 13:27.020
Alexander fell face first
into the cow paddy

13:27.054 --> 13:28.787
and got a bit
of poop up nose?

13:28.820 --> 13:31.320
That's pretty much par for
the course with Alexanders.

13:31.354 --> 13:33.154
So, what would
you rather have then,

13:33.187 --> 13:35.687
a bit of pee in your mouth or
a bit of poop up your nose?

13:35.720 --> 13:36.887
Well...

13:37.820 --> 13:39.287
Well, fuckin' neither.

13:39.320 --> 13:41.020
Well, but it's hypothetical,
it's a game.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.854
It's called,
"Would You Rather."

13:42.887 --> 13:44.320
So, you got to pick one or the
other is what you're saying.

13:44.354 --> 13:45.754
Yes. It's hypothetical.

13:45.787 --> 13:47.320
Kinda feels
like you did pot.

13:47.354 --> 13:49.154
Well, how much pee's
are we talking about?

13:49.187 --> 13:50.587
Yeah, and how much poop?

13:50.620 --> 13:52.054
Okay, so if we're
talking about,

13:52.087 --> 13:54.220
like an eyedropper,
be like, mmm...

13:54.254 --> 13:57.587
Four or five drops of pee,
right in your mouth.

13:57.620 --> 14:01.020
Or, let's call it like,

14:01.054 --> 14:02.854
the end
of the pinkie fingernail,

14:02.887 --> 14:05.320
full poop, up your nose.

14:05.354 --> 14:07.020
For the rest
of your life.

14:07.054 --> 14:08.754
Oh, so it's for the rest
of your fuckin' life now?

14:08.787 --> 14:11.154
Yeah. Would you rather have

14:11.187 --> 14:14.687
a bit of pee in your mouth,
or a bit of poop up nose?

14:14.720 --> 14:16.654
And you... You can't spits
the pee's out your mouth

14:16.687 --> 14:18.087
or blows the poops
out of your nose?

14:18.120 --> 14:19.754
Well, see, Dary would just
lick it off his lips

14:19.787 --> 14:21.154
after blowin' it out anyway.

14:21.187 --> 14:23.754
That's correct, Dan.

14:23.787 --> 14:25.287
I think I'd take
the poops in my nose.

14:25.320 --> 14:27.087
But then you'd be smelling

14:27.120 --> 14:29.120
poop for the rest of your
life. And poop is potent, pal.

14:29.154 --> 14:30.654
Yeah, but if you had
pee's in your mouth

14:30.687 --> 14:32.920
and every time you takes
a bites of food, you...

14:32.954 --> 14:34.154
You're gonna be
tasting pee's.

14:34.187 --> 14:35.854
Yeah.

14:35.887 --> 14:37.054
And you're gonna have to
swallow a bit of that pee

14:37.087 --> 14:38.354
with every time
you take a bite of food.

14:38.387 --> 14:40.320
Do you wanna know what,
I'd take the poop.

14:40.354 --> 14:41.854
Yes, I would take the poop.

14:41.887 --> 14:45.054
Well, there's no chance
of ingesting's the poop?

14:45.087 --> 14:47.254
Well, I'm not a scientist
or anything,

14:47.287 --> 14:50.220
that's not really
my forte,

14:50.254 --> 14:52.254
but say you had
the sniffles, right?

14:52.287 --> 14:53.820
And you honk one back,

14:53.854 --> 14:55.187
and you get a piece of that
poop right in

14:55.220 --> 14:56.887
the back of your throat,
that's down the hatch.

14:56.920 --> 14:57.987
Well, see that's changing
the fuckin' rules, Dary.

14:58.020 --> 14:59.187
Before you said
you're either

14:59.220 --> 15:00.820
taste the pee
or smell the poop.

15:00.854 --> 15:02.987
Now you're saying you're
tasting and smelling poop.

15:03.020 --> 15:05.887
Well, the pee is in your mouth
and the poop is in your nose.

15:05.920 --> 15:08.820
What happens after that
is beyond my control.

15:08.854 --> 15:10.087
Well, he's right there,
Wayne.

15:11.820 --> 15:12.854
DARYL: So?

15:13.687 --> 15:15.287
'Kay, just...

15:15.320 --> 15:17.120
'Kay, you wanna know what...

15:17.154 --> 15:19.620
'Kay, let's all answer
at the exact same time.

15:19.654 --> 15:21.587
And a one and a two and a one,
two, three...

15:21.620 --> 15:23.120
‐ALL: Poop... Pee.
‐What the fuck was that shit?

15:23.154 --> 15:26.720
‐That is shameful, Dary.
‐That is... Shame on you.

15:26.754 --> 15:28.087
(ALL ARGUING)

15:28.120 --> 15:29.854
Know what?
I'd have a fuckin' spit!

15:32.865 --> 15:34.099
Now before we proceed,

15:34.132 --> 15:36.999
dost thou knoweth
where Devon is?

15:37.032 --> 15:38.432
‐Who?
‐Devon.

15:38.465 --> 15:39.565
‐No.
‐No.

15:39.599 --> 15:40.699
‐Yes.
‐Yes?

15:40.732 --> 15:42.065
‐No!
‐(WHIMPERS)

15:42.099 --> 15:43.365
You appear...

15:44.699 --> 15:45.732
Felonious.

15:45.765 --> 15:47.932
You appear erroneous.

15:50.499 --> 15:52.565
How are we to know that
you are not responsible

15:52.599 --> 15:53.832
for Devon's disappearance?

15:53.865 --> 15:56.065
I don't know, how are you?

15:56.099 --> 15:57.999
Still a little
hurt and fragile

15:58.032 --> 16:00.332
from speaking with my father.
But thank you for asking.

16:00.365 --> 16:01.699
That's not what
she's saying, Roald.

16:01.732 --> 16:03.532
‐(WHIMPERS)
‐What are you saying, Stewart?

16:03.565 --> 16:06.965
I'm just saying,
as Devon fades,

16:06.999 --> 16:09.932
you materialize.

16:10.799 --> 16:11.965
Simple math.

16:11.999 --> 16:13.565
Child's play.

16:13.599 --> 16:16.365
Cool movie.
Though I prefer Problem Child.

16:16.399 --> 16:17.599
Same.

16:21.499 --> 16:23.532
(WHISPERS)
What's with the clown costume?

16:23.565 --> 16:24.765
Sit.

16:26.599 --> 16:27.665
Stay.

16:29.965 --> 16:31.365
Speak.

16:31.399 --> 16:32.965
What's with the clown costume?

16:32.999 --> 16:34.665
Don't you watch the news?

16:34.699 --> 16:36.332
There are clowns
inflicting apprehension

16:36.365 --> 16:38.832
on the general public
via sheer terrorism,

16:38.865 --> 16:41.032
or petty vandalism all over
North America.

16:41.065 --> 16:43.799
So, you've coalesced
with some sort of continental,

16:43.832 --> 16:45.465
inter‐colonial clown posse?

16:45.999 --> 16:48.565
I'm a bad seed.

16:48.599 --> 16:51.465
Staying out late,
missing curfew, you know...

16:51.499 --> 16:52.999
I know.

16:53.032 --> 16:56.399
‐Kissing boys.
‐(SOFTLY) Hmm. I know.

16:56.432 --> 17:00.065
‐What is it you seek, Gae?
‐Asylum.

17:00.099 --> 17:02.065
Remember Soul Asylum?

17:02.099 --> 17:04.032
Cool band.
Though I prefer Soulfly.

17:04.065 --> 17:05.799
Same.

17:05.832 --> 17:07.932
‐Collective Soul?
‐Or Soulwax.

17:07.965 --> 17:10.399
‐Wondrous.
‐soulDecision?

17:10.432 --> 17:12.065
‐Asylum granted!
‐Domo.

17:12.099 --> 17:14.399
‐Arigato.
‐I'm here to rebel.

17:14.432 --> 17:18.565
Give me three good reasons
why you feel you must rebel.

17:18.599 --> 17:19.865
I hate the world.

17:19.899 --> 17:21.599
I hate my parents.

17:21.632 --> 17:22.932
I hate myself.

20:14.599 --> 20:17.432

No, they are not functional,
