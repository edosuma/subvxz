00:22.320 --> 00:23.924
Come in.

00:25.160 --> 00:28.448
- She's in.
- Chief, this is for you.

00:40.760 --> 00:43.047
Luzhniki Stadium? Moscow?

00:43.360 --> 00:45.249
An invitation to the World Cup final.

00:46.240 --> 00:47.651
Where did you get this?

00:47.800 --> 00:50.770
Won in the FIFA lottery. More details in
the letter.

00:51.080 --> 00:52.411
Are you trying to bribe me?

00:53.680 --> 00:55.330
Do you think, if you give me this,

00:55.520 --> 00:57.249
that I won't fire you?

00:58.720 --> 01:00.449
Well, you're fucking right.

01:02.440 --> 01:04.885
World Cup. Aeroplane.

01:05.319 --> 01:08.529
Waldorf Astoria Hotel.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.360
It's fake, Chief.

01:10.880 --> 01:12.086
What, there's no hotel?

01:12.520 --> 01:15.842
It's all fake, Chief. I wrote and printed
this.

01:16.280 --> 01:17.566
You did?

01:18.160 --> 01:19.321
Yeah.

01:19.520 --> 01:20.760
Why?

01:21.080 --> 01:22.445
Everybody loves football.

01:22.880 --> 01:28.011
We'll send these invitations to all the
wanted criminals.

01:28.400 --> 01:31.609
They would all end up in one place. On
the same day. At the same time.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.565
We will bust them all in one go.

01:36.560 --> 01:37.766
World Cup.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.848
Final. Moscow. Wouldn't you go, Sir?

01:40.320 --> 01:41.731
You know what, Konarska?

01:41.880 --> 01:45.043
I'm emotionally ambivalent about you.

01:48.320 --> 01:49.606
What does that mean?

01:49.760 --> 01:51.205
It means I don't like you.

01:53.440 --> 01:54.885
Get the fuck out.

02:08.520 --> 02:09.645
Konarska speaking.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.121
In the community house in Wosniki,

02:12.520 --> 02:13.931
sitting in the hall are...

02:14.080 --> 02:16.811
20 wanted criminals.

02:18.640 --> 02:20.165
Good morning.

02:20.560 --> 02:22.562
Welcome, winners.

02:23.520 --> 02:27.844
My name is Andzelika Konopnicka and I
will accompany you.

02:29.120 --> 02:31.521
As your tour guide, of course,

02:31.760 --> 02:35.845
on the trip to the World Cup finals in
Russia.

02:36.320 --> 02:38.209
In Moscow's Luzhniki.

02:38.800 --> 02:41.724
All right. Now, to get to know each other
better...

02:42.320 --> 02:43.685
we'll play a little game.

02:46.320 --> 02:47.367
Who is this?

02:47.560 --> 02:48.561
Zabivaka.

02:48.720 --> 02:49.767
Yes, bravo!

02:50.240 --> 02:53.289
It's Zabivaka the Wolf, the Russian world
cup mascot.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.731
All together now. Who is this?

02:57.520 --> 02:58.567
Zabivaka.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.127
I can't hear you. Who?

03:00.440 --> 03:02.044
- Zabivaka.
- Who?!

03:02.400 --> 03:03.890
- Zabivaka!
- Who?!

03:04.240 --> 03:07.005
Zabivaka! Zabivaka! Zabivaka!

03:08.520 --> 03:09.567
Bravo.

03:10.280 --> 03:11.281
All right, so...

03:11.520 --> 03:13.124
We know each other a little better now.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.761
Now we need to fill in the forms.

03:16.240 --> 03:19.244
The invitations are for personal use
only, so...

03:19.840 --> 03:22.525
please show me your identity cards.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.807
Hey, I know you.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.765
You arrested me at the off-license.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.008
No way. You're joking.

03:30.400 --> 03:33.370
- Lads, this bitch works for the police.
- What about the World Cup?

03:35.560 --> 03:36.607
What now, bitch?

03:39.720 --> 03:40.721
Are you mental?

03:40.722 --> 03:44.691
Everybody get down on the ground, hands
and IDs in the air.

03:45.080 --> 03:47.651
Get down! Get down on the ground!

03:48.000 --> 03:49.525
You won't be able to fuck us all up.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.044
Maybe not, but I can fuck you up, right?

03:54.760 --> 03:56.364
Catch that whore!

03:56.800 --> 03:58.325
Stop, bitch!

03:58.520 --> 04:01.763
Bitch!

04:02.120 --> 04:04.521
Catch that whore!

04:04.680 --> 04:07.047
Come on, come on, fuck!

04:12.120 --> 04:13.246
Open it!

04:21.079 --> 04:23.401
Fucking open it!

04:23.760 --> 04:27.128
- Stop, stop or I'll shoot!
- Move back!

04:41.880 --> 04:43.769
Hey! Hey!

04:56.280 --> 04:58.521
- Send back up!
- What code?

04:59.080 --> 05:00.525
Fucking all of them!

05:22.080 --> 05:23.525
Police! Get down on the ground!

05:24.640 --> 05:27.644
Stop! Police! Get down!

05:28.240 --> 05:29.651
Stop!

05:30.000 --> 05:31.809
Stop! Get down! Get down!

05:32.160 --> 05:33.286
Police! Down!

05:36.280 --> 05:37.884
Hands, hands, hands!

05:40.880 --> 05:43.360
- Go, go, go!
- Get down! Don't move!

05:50.800 --> 05:53.883
Get the fuck down!

06:08.240 --> 06:09.321
Gun and badge.

06:17.560 --> 06:19.324
You're screwed, Konarska.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.041
Do you know why?

06:21.640 --> 06:24.849
Because this is our borough. Our little
homeland.

06:25.520 --> 06:27.329
We don't like people like you.

06:28.800 --> 06:29.847
Like what?

06:32.560 --> 06:35.450
A child of a whore can never grow up to
be a police officer.

06:37.080 --> 06:38.241
Get the fuck out.

06:47.520 --> 06:50.171
- Hello?
- Sergeant Izabela Konarska?

06:50.320 --> 06:51.446
Yes, who's speaking?

06:51.520 --> 06:54.410
I'm calling from the Internal Security
Agency.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.045
Maybe from Gestapo?

06:56.320 --> 07:00.041
I see you passed the fitness
test in one minute,

07:00.200 --> 07:04.762
eighteen point zero-four seconds.
54 Points.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.001
And?

07:07.040 --> 07:10.931
I would like to meet up with you on
Rakowiecka Street in Warsaw.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.651
Those World Cup invitations were a damn
good idea.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.681
We're impressed.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.844
You would have received
an award from us.

07:18.280 --> 07:19.361
Do you wanna play with us?

07:21.520 --> 07:22.567
Well, I could try.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.724
You've got a background with the police.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.606
Do you know what a PPP is?

07:26.760 --> 07:29.525
An undercover police officer, right?

07:30.520 --> 07:33.285
In the IS A, special operations are
carried out by squad S.

07:33.880 --> 07:37.009
I need agents that are willing to delve
into the criminal underworld.

07:37.320 --> 07:39.527
I'm looking for people who think outside
the box,

07:39.680 --> 07:42.126
who aren't afraid to take risks and can
work under pressure.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.526
This job is fucking full-on.

07:46.440 --> 07:48.044
Will you take part in the recruitment?

07:48.520 --> 07:50.124
I don't know, I'll have to sleep on it.

07:50.880 --> 07:52.325
Relax, you have a minute.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.051
I can't fall asleep in one minute.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.047
You see Iza,

07:57.360 --> 08:00.603
An agent sometimes has to make a split
second decision. Life or death.

08:01.400 --> 08:02.447
But don't worry,

08:02.800 --> 08:04.643
you still have time. 30 seconds.

08:05.640 --> 08:06.687
I choose 'life'.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.525
Mom wants to tell you something.

08:22.880 --> 08:23.927
Bartek.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.087
I'm leaving.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.171
For a long time.

08:28.760 --> 08:30.762
I'll miss you so much,

08:30.920 --> 08:35.005
and I know you'll miss me but you'll stay
with your dad who loves you very much.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.644
Mom! Mom!

08:50.400 --> 08:52.880
Here are our friends from the FBI.

08:53.440 --> 08:55.249
They will tell you about their experiences.

08:55.520 --> 08:58.524
They'll provide lessons to the undercover
police officers.

08:59.680 --> 09:00.886
Good luck.

09:38.680 --> 09:39.966
You're fucked up.

10:55.760 --> 10:57.091
Shut up.

11:28.360 --> 11:32.649
Bartek, Bartek. Bartek is my son.

11:35.240 --> 11:37.811
My mother was a whore.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.247
I gave in.

11:43.520 --> 11:47.525
Everybody does. Some sooner, some later.
You belong to the second group.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.167
What's all this for?

11:50.600 --> 11:52.682
This figurehead will be your target.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.367
A gangster from Mokotow. Alias Padrino.

11:57.160 --> 11:59.891
He's smuggling drugs into Scandinavia.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.643
And we need to stop him.

12:04.040 --> 12:07.328
- You want me to get close to him?
- To one of his people.

12:15.640 --> 12:18.086
What's going on? Ls everything all right?

12:18.800 --> 12:19.847
Get the fuck out.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.766
Sorry boss, but Futro is throwing a
tantrum.

12:49.960 --> 12:51.849
Get the fuck out of here!

12:52.000 --> 12:53.570
I beg your pardon.

12:53.720 --> 12:56.087
How could you do this to me?!
Did you forget you have a daughter?!

12:56.240 --> 12:58.527
Did you consider my feelings?!
I feel like shit!

12:58.720 --> 13:00.688
Did you not think I have feelings and
emotions?!

13:01.040 --> 13:02.087
You want a superstar?

13:02.520 --> 13:04.841
Then you have a superstar! But I won't be
supporting her!

13:05.320 --> 13:06.685
What's all this about?

13:06.840 --> 13:08.524
About this old skank!

13:08.600 --> 13:09.647
Anything but old.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.010
Who the fuck is this?

13:12.200 --> 13:15.841
This is Miss Kasia, a famous singer.
She's your birthday present.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.640
But I'm his present, not this old hag.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.127
Calm your daughter down, or I'll do it
myself!

13:21.240 --> 13:22.730
All right, get the fuck out, bitch.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.047
Excuse me?

13:24.200 --> 13:26.282
Kick her out and give her some money or
some shit.

13:26.720 --> 13:33.763
Calm down, sweetheart. You know I love
your talent. I would never hurt you.

13:35.080 --> 13:38.687
Sing, girl, sing beautifully.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.765
Why are you so fucking happy?

13:44.160 --> 13:46.527
We rarely go out together.

13:46.720 --> 13:48.006
You go out all the time, bitch.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.207
But without you.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.443
This is a special occasion for me, you
know?

13:51.640 --> 13:53.324
Even more so than Valentine's day.

13:54.840 --> 13:56.524
Look who's behind us.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.570
Fuck, it's the damn weather woman.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.365
Let's take a selfie.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.004
- Fucking hell.
- Got it.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.688
Holy shit. Please, please.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.321
Oh, Justynka.

14:09.720 --> 14:12.769
You look so nice. Where's your Romeo?

14:13.640 --> 14:14.687
I don't know.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.245
Come, look who's over there.

14:22.080 --> 14:23.127
Hello.

14:23.320 --> 14:26.005
Could I take a photo with you?

14:26.400 --> 14:27.447
Where is Milimetr?

14:28.760 --> 14:29.807
Fuck knows.

14:41.520 --> 14:42.760
Until I finish.

15:00.720 --> 15:02.290
There's sperm on your trousers.

15:05.360 --> 15:06.805
Did you blow your nose up her ass?

15:13.600 --> 15:14.726
You're the only one I love.

15:20.640 --> 15:21.687
Just one pic.

15:22.520 --> 15:25.569
He's on fucking television every day,
just take a photo of the screen.

15:25.720 --> 15:26.767
Once a week.

15:27.240 --> 15:32.201
Beautiful ladies, dear gentlemen, please
greet the hero of this evening.

15:33.280 --> 15:37.205
Did I say hero of this evening? It's as
if I didn't say anything.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.887
Meet the man who dedicated his whole
life...

15:40.320 --> 15:42.527
to help others.

15:42.760 --> 15:45.604
Today is his 55th birthday.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.205
Mr Pawet Chyb!

15:50.520 --> 15:56.129
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to
you...

15:57.240 --> 15:59.242
It's not my turn yet.

15:59.840 --> 16:00.887
And now...

16:01.560 --> 16:04.040
Here's my daughter.

16:04.360 --> 16:05.441
Listen to her sing.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.529
She's fucking amazing.

16:19.880 --> 16:24.283
Happy birthday to you.

16:25.120 --> 16:29.648
Happy birthday to you.

16:30.200 --> 16:34.569
Happy birthday dear...

16:35.360 --> 16:36.725
daddy.

16:38.240 --> 16:46.250
Happy birthday to you!

16:49.040 --> 16:50.769
I love you daddy.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.727
My daughter, my greatest creation.

17:08.520 --> 17:09.851
OK, everybody!

17:10.599 --> 17:13.762
Give it to me, give it to me,
give it to me!

17:14.160 --> 17:20.441
Give it to me, give it to me,
give it to me!

17:20.680 --> 17:25.367
Give it to me, give it to me...
Give it to me, oh!

17:25.560 --> 17:27.528
What's wrong?

17:27.880 --> 17:29.245
Delete this.

17:29.520 --> 17:31.966
If I find this on the internet, you're
dead.

17:32.320 --> 17:36.166
Because love is in the air now.

17:38.800 --> 17:44.603
And I love you daddy, sooo! Sooo! Yeah!

17:48.440 --> 17:49.521
Shhh... Hear that?

17:51.080 --> 17:52.127
What?

17:53.360 --> 17:54.407
Exactly. Nothing.

17:55.880 --> 17:57.405
No noise will get in here.

17:58.640 --> 18:00.005
What's up with Zywy?

18:00.120 --> 18:02.600
The court hearing is in two days, and the
confidant is still breathing.

18:02.760 --> 18:03.841
It's all sorted.

18:04.120 --> 18:05.167
How?

18:05.400 --> 18:06.970
I'll send my girl to lure the guy out.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.567
I'll take him out.

18:16.840 --> 18:18.410
I don't want to.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.327
You do.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.204
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.320
I won't do it.

18:26.360 --> 18:27.407
You will.

18:28.160 --> 18:30.003
Ask one of your whores.

18:30.520 --> 18:32.045
I don't trust him. You're lucky.

18:32.520 --> 18:33.601
Fucking lucky?

18:33.840 --> 18:36.411
You're with me. You got lucky in life.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.404
Stop laughing while you're looking at me.

18:45.360 --> 18:46.725
You asked me to look.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.207
I asked?

18:49.720 --> 18:50.801
I never ask.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.125
Tell me you love me.

18:57.880 --> 18:58.927
Tell me you love me.

18:59.240 --> 19:00.287
I love you.

19:01.360 --> 19:02.407
Crook.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.725
I fucking love you!

19:12.720 --> 19:14.006
I love you too.

19:19.800 --> 19:22.849
Why her? Grabus told them, not her.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.691
She keeps going to him.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.320
This is fucking love.

19:26.440 --> 19:27.726
How much sugar did you put in?

19:28.240 --> 19:31.289
Sugar is for amateurs, I poured
water glass into the tank.

19:31.520 --> 19:32.681
Why is the car still moving?

19:33.240 --> 19:35.004
Relax, it's gonna work.

20:04.640 --> 20:07.769
Grabus' woman rented this room so she
could see his cell.

20:19.320 --> 20:20.560
Is it drilled into your head?

20:21.520 --> 20:22.760
Rysiek, fucking come out.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.201
Wrong.

20:24.360 --> 20:27.045
Rysiek, Rysiek. Say it twice. If you say
it once, it means hide.

20:27.200 --> 20:30.124
Rysiek, Rysiek, fucking come out. Happy?

20:30.840 --> 20:31.887
Don't be so mardy.

20:32.520 --> 20:33.567
Go ahead.

20:48.360 --> 20:49.407
Rysiek!

20:51.520 --> 20:53.204
Rysiek, fucking come out!

20:59.840 --> 21:01.205
Fucking hell.

21:09.240 --> 21:10.526
I love you, Rysiek!

21:17.240 --> 21:19.129
Your honour. In this situation,

21:19.280 --> 21:22.170
I have no choice but
to ask you to release

21:22.320 --> 21:24.766
the defendant from his
provisional detention.

21:25.040 --> 21:28.522
This indictment is based on the evidence
of one witness.

21:28.760 --> 21:34.164
A shamed criminal, who, for obvious
reasons, cannot give us his evidence.

21:34.520 --> 21:35.567
Your honour...

21:36.200 --> 21:38.521
I completely agree with my lawyer.

21:38.720 --> 21:40.324
I would like to return to work as soon as
possible.

21:40.520 --> 21:44.650
I will show up to all summons. And please
suspend my detention. Thank you.

21:52.120 --> 21:56.842
Fuck, an ironed suit, but did they steal
your fucking bag?

21:57.080 --> 21:58.127
They'll deliver it.

21:59.040 --> 22:01.327
I thought you would've gained some
weight, but you're stick thin.

22:01.520 --> 22:02.521
I didn't have the time.

22:02.560 --> 22:04.528
Padrino, surprise.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.451
Say hello.

22:07.520 --> 22:08.851
Hi Padrino, it's me.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.287
Hey kid.

22:11.320 --> 22:12.367
Thanks.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.210
You'd have done the same. See you.

22:16.080 --> 22:17.366
Daddy, I have a request.

22:17.600 --> 22:20.001
- A car?
- No, my friend will drive me.

22:20.360 --> 22:21.361
Do I know him?

22:21.400 --> 22:24.051
Do you know, listen to me, darling?

22:24.520 --> 22:25.567
What is that?

22:29.880 --> 22:35.046
Listen to me, darling!

22:35.280 --> 22:39.080
- And the night and the day!
- Nice.

22:39.240 --> 22:41.641
Nice, lovely.

22:42.760 --> 22:44.524
Darek composed this.

22:44.720 --> 22:46.529
Another busker?

22:46.800 --> 22:51.044
A composer, dad, who's very talented.
He's my songwriter.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.006
I need money.

22:54.600 --> 22:55.601
How much?

22:55.760 --> 22:58.650
Oh, not much. Whatever you can spare.

23:02.360 --> 23:03.407
I love you.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.609
A talented fucking composer.

23:13.440 --> 23:14.566
Investigate that wanker.

23:28.160 --> 23:29.605
Holy shit.

23:30.280 --> 23:31.645
Fucking heaven.

23:33.840 --> 23:35.888
Do you know how much I missed this?

23:36.600 --> 23:37.886
This, or me?

23:39.520 --> 23:40.601
It's the same thing to me.

23:41.360 --> 23:42.361
You're bullshitting.

23:42.520 --> 23:44.363
I love fucking you.

23:49.040 --> 23:50.087
Did he do this to you?

23:53.520 --> 23:55.682
Son of a whore. You have to leave him.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.047
And go where?

23:57.720 --> 23:59.802
- To you?
- Do you love me?

24:01.320 --> 24:03.288
- He'll kill me.
- I'll protect you.

24:05.800 --> 24:07.290
Then you'll have to kill him.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.411
- He's my brother.
- And what am I, the slutty sister-in-law?

24:15.360 --> 24:17.408
- I'll come up with something.
- Then think.

24:32.520 --> 24:34.204
Fuck, leave me alone, leave.

26:00.600 --> 26:01.647
Who is this?

26:07.080 --> 26:08.730
Can't you fucking hear me? Who is this?

26:10.520 --> 26:11.885
Some country girl.

26:12.600 --> 26:15.001
From Ptonsk, some country hick, right?

27:34.640 --> 27:36.688
- Come, let's dance.
- Don't fucking touch me.

28:14.520 --> 28:15.567
What's your name?

28:15.880 --> 28:17.120
Hocus Pocus.

28:19.800 --> 28:20.847
Can you do a magic trick?

28:21.360 --> 28:22.407
Yes.

28:23.640 --> 28:25.449
Can we disappear from here?

28:27.240 --> 28:28.651
Hocus pocus.

28:32.200 --> 28:33.281
It's not working.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.047
Look.

29:08.440 --> 29:09.521
You move fast.

29:10.280 --> 29:15.241
0 to 100 in three seconds, 700 horse
power, one clutch and seven gears.

29:15.880 --> 29:17.882
I've seen you park it.

29:21.360 --> 29:22.885
Did you fall for me or my car?

29:26.400 --> 29:27.731
Hocus pocus.

29:38.080 --> 29:39.684
The car won't start.

29:40.520 --> 29:43.330
I don't give shit. This fucking
car cost me half a million euros,

29:43.520 --> 29:45.409
fucking come and fix it.

29:45.640 --> 29:50.089
I don't fucking care, get here right
now and jump - start the car!

29:50.640 --> 29:52.802
Fucker... I said it so do it, bye.

29:53.840 --> 29:56.571
Fucking motherfucker.

29:58.800 --> 30:00.529
What are you doing?

30:01.240 --> 30:07.043
My dad owned a garage and always told me:
"The engine is the heart of the car".

30:07.280 --> 30:09.601
Do you fucking think I'll take my car to
any old place?

30:09.760 --> 30:11.330
Can you get in and start the car?

30:11.520 --> 30:13.124
Go home. You'll get wet.

30:18.040 --> 30:19.530
What the fuck are you doing?

30:23.840 --> 30:25.080
Hocus pocus.

30:27.720 --> 30:29.290
Fine, do you want a lift?

30:29.720 --> 30:30.846
No.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.361
Then you drive.

30:34.120 --> 30:35.451
I can't, they took my license.

30:36.440 --> 30:37.521
Mine too.

30:38.520 --> 30:39.567
I drank beer.

30:39.840 --> 30:40.887
Me too.

30:44.200 --> 30:45.247
Then we'll crash the car.

30:45.720 --> 30:46.767
Fucking great.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.120
That's what this is all about.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.290
You're nuts.

31:58.440 --> 32:00.010
Looks like I won't die tonight.

32:13.160 --> 32:14.207
Without music?

32:18.040 --> 32:19.087
I prefer it like this.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.126
Shall we dance?

34:32.800 --> 34:33.960
What the fuck are you doing?

34:34.679 --> 34:35.761
I was looking for a towel.

34:37.760 --> 34:38.806
Did you touch anything?

34:40.320 --> 34:41.321
The towel.

34:41.520 --> 34:42.806
Fuck, did you touch anything?

34:45.040 --> 34:46.087
The AK.

34:48.199 --> 34:49.246
Which one?

35:00.080 --> 35:02.526
Police! Get the fuck down!

35:02.760 --> 35:05.161
Fucking hell, are you guys nuts?

35:06.520 --> 35:07.851
What the fuck is happening here?

35:09.520 --> 35:10.567
She's seen the goods.

35:11.360 --> 35:12.885
She was looking for a fucking towel.

35:15.440 --> 35:16.521
She won't tell anyone.

35:17.400 --> 35:18.447
I guarantee it.

35:20.720 --> 35:21.881
You have a problem.

35:23.840 --> 35:24.887
Stop.

35:26.520 --> 35:27.567
Stop.

35:28.440 --> 35:29.521
Look at me.

35:32.760 --> 35:33.807
Look.

35:37.120 --> 35:38.167
Between the eyes,

35:39.880 --> 35:40.927
or straight to the heart?

35:45.280 --> 35:47.362
You're acting so tough 'cause you're
holding a gun.

35:48.640 --> 35:50.165
How about a one-on-one?

35:52.520 --> 35:53.567
Come on.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.001
Come on.

35:55.160 --> 35:56.400
Don't say you don't hit women.

35:58.720 --> 35:59.767
I do.

36:00.600 --> 36:01.681
Especially whores.

36:02.600 --> 36:03.647
Milimetr, fuck.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.284
I should dispose of one of you now.

36:09.320 --> 36:10.731
You'll have some dirt on me then.

36:11.320 --> 36:13.129
Who do I dislike the most? You!

36:14.040 --> 36:15.087
Cieniu.

36:19.560 --> 36:20.561
Calm down.

36:20.680 --> 36:21.727
I'll fuck him up.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.081
- Relax, give me that.
- I'll fuck him up.

36:23.160 --> 36:24.207
Give me that.

36:24.400 --> 36:25.401
I'll fuck him up.

36:25.600 --> 36:26.601
Give me that.

36:26.760 --> 36:28.205
Or I'll help you rob the jeweler.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.761
An easy way to make two million. You keep
the money,

36:32.120 --> 36:34.009
you'll have dirt on me, and nobody will
die.

36:43.520 --> 36:44.567
What do you think?

36:51.440 --> 36:53.124
Is everything definitely sorted out?

36:53.400 --> 36:55.846
Don't worry, my cousin built this building.

36:56.280 --> 36:58.681
Nobody will be here on the 11th of
November.

36:58.840 --> 36:59.887
I hope so.

37:03.800 --> 37:05.165
Throw the backpack onto the roof.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.284
More than 5 thousand ounces.

39:17.880 --> 39:19.564
And you would've let them shoot me.

39:37.680 --> 39:38.727
Will you marry me?

39:41.360 --> 39:42.725
You have a wife.

39:43.520 --> 39:44.646
I'll have a second one.

39:47.080 --> 39:49.367
What happens in the ghetto, stays in the
ghetto.

39:52.080 --> 39:54.162
You're a moron.

40:01.400 --> 40:02.845
And they lived happily ever after?

40:03.400 --> 40:05.289
They didn't live long, but they lived
happily.

40:06.240 --> 40:07.321
All right.

40:26.240 --> 40:27.287
Nice.

40:28.280 --> 40:29.770
Shit, dad, I fucking crashed!

40:31.000 --> 40:32.001
What did you just say?

40:32.120 --> 40:33.531
Nothing. It was a race in Monaco.

40:33.880 --> 40:37.248
Son, don't use those words, they're bad
words.

40:37.640 --> 40:38.721
For fuck's sake.

40:39.120 --> 40:40.531
Fuck, don't say that in front of the kid!

40:40.680 --> 40:41.681
Klaudia is positive.

40:41.800 --> 40:43.086
I don't give a shit. -What
do you mean 'positive'?

40:43.240 --> 40:44.241
Sero.

40:44.360 --> 40:46.647
She kept sleeping around and contracted
HIV.

40:46.880 --> 40:47.927
Shit.

40:49.720 --> 40:52.291
I told her to use protection.

40:52.400 --> 40:53.447
Fucking hell.

40:53.880 --> 40:57.441
This is a tragedy, a tragedy! I have to
go and save her!

40:57.600 --> 41:00.365
Stop fucking talking about that whore.
You didn't hear that.

41:01.320 --> 41:02.845
Can you look after Maciek for a bit?

41:03.000 --> 41:04.126
I have to go to work.

41:06.600 --> 41:07.761
So what am I supposed to do?

41:10.160 --> 41:11.207
Call the nanny?

41:12.000 --> 41:13.047
Yes!

41:16.720 --> 41:17.767
Darling,

41:18.080 --> 41:19.127
Milady speaking.

41:19.520 --> 41:21.522
Who were you afraid of when you were
little?

41:24.520 --> 41:26.602
I don't know. There was Robert in the
kindergarten.

41:27.400 --> 41:31.166
He had a harelip and was ugly...

41:32.160 --> 41:33.207
You remember this?

41:34.520 --> 41:36.363
No, mom told me. Sleep.

41:37.040 --> 41:38.530
My mom doesn't tell me any stories.

41:40.760 --> 41:41.761
What about your dad?

41:41.920 --> 41:43.081
We play on the console.

41:44.120 --> 41:46.122
- Daria, come here!
- Sleep.

41:56.200 --> 41:57.201
Where is it?

41:57.400 --> 41:59.562
- What?
- Rolex.

41:59.600 --> 42:01.409
- Who?
- My diamond watch.

42:03.120 --> 42:04.167
I don't know.

42:04.400 --> 42:05.447
Don't lie.

42:05.640 --> 42:06.641
You stole it.

42:06.680 --> 42:07.806
Empty your pockets.

42:11.400 --> 42:12.447
Back pockets.

42:27.840 --> 42:29.649
I just wanted to play with it.

42:45.520 --> 42:47.284
You bitch, you thief!

42:47.680 --> 42:49.125
Get the fuck out of my house!

42:50.280 --> 42:51.645
Can you fucking not shout?

42:51.800 --> 42:53.040
I'm not screaming.

42:53.200 --> 42:54.247
Fuck...

42:54.880 --> 42:55.927
You're shouting.

42:56.080 --> 42:57.730
- You're always shouting.
- How am I shouting? How am I shouting?

42:57.880 --> 43:00.611
You're fucking shouting, you've been
shouting your whole life!

43:00.800 --> 43:03.610
- Kick her out of the fucking house!
- Who will look after the kid?!

43:03.760 --> 43:05.171
I don't know, I don't give a shit!

43:05.280 --> 43:06.441
'I don't give a shit'. Fuck.

43:06.600 --> 43:09.001
- Yes, I don't give a shit!
- Fuck this!

43:09.280 --> 43:14.047
Here, 500 ztoty, now fucking go to my son!

43:15.040 --> 43:19.762
Wipe your fucking ass with this. I'll buy
you eight fucking rolex watches!

43:24.560 --> 43:25.607
Is this the subject?

43:26.640 --> 43:27.721
Wotka Kosowska, a bank.

43:29.640 --> 43:31.324
Fucking Chinatown.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.048
They always come between 9 and 10am.

43:38.640 --> 43:40.404
There are always two of them, and the
driver.

43:40.600 --> 43:41.647
Electric?

43:42.440 --> 43:43.521
Like the security.

43:45.160 --> 43:47.527
Guns. They don't have bigger firearms.

43:48.320 --> 43:50.084
Mtody saw them come out with a rifle once.

43:50.600 --> 43:52.409
I would do this even if they had bigger
guns.

43:52.640 --> 43:54.324
We'll surprise them. They'll be in shock.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.365
Don't speak with your mouth full.

44:05.880 --> 44:07.530
I would like to grow old with you.

44:10.880 --> 44:12.370
You'll always be young to me.

44:14.520 --> 44:15.601
Quit the fucking bullshit.

44:36.400 --> 44:37.526
Fuck me.

45:01.520 --> 45:03.522
Do you wish you were born again?

45:05.360 --> 45:06.407
Why?

45:12.600 --> 45:13.647
I don't know.

45:14.360 --> 45:15.521
You could change your life.

45:18.080 --> 45:19.127
I tried.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.047
I owned a pub,

45:23.120 --> 45:24.167
a kebab place,

45:25.200 --> 45:26.247
and a tanning salon.

45:26.840 --> 45:28.330
Tanning salon?

45:29.520 --> 45:32.524
I had to either subsidize or subsidize.

45:35.360 --> 45:36.725
Money isn't everything.

45:39.760 --> 45:41.091
It's not about the money.

45:43.320 --> 45:44.367
Then what?

45:46.280 --> 45:47.520
I want to mean something.

46:01.120 --> 46:02.326
There's the convoy.

46:26.760 --> 46:27.807
On three.

46:29.400 --> 46:30.447
One...

46:30.760 --> 46:31.807
Two... Three!

46:34.040 --> 46:35.087
Get down!

46:35.400 --> 46:36.447
Get down!

46:37.560 --> 46:40.564
Get down on the ground!

46:41.000 --> 46:43.082
Get out of the fucking car!

47:10.240 --> 47:11.287
Shut up.

47:11.600 --> 47:13.045
Fucking look at me.

47:14.680 --> 47:16.011
This is your lucky day.

48:08.560 --> 48:11.166
I want to report who robbed the bank in
Wotka Kosowska.

48:17.160 --> 48:18.207
Police!

48:25.760 --> 48:27.524
Did you shoot your own reflection?

48:27.840 --> 48:28.841
Fuck off.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.526
Shit, we need to call a glazier, or we'll
be screwed.

48:32.280 --> 48:35.602
No, no darling, don't make me laugh,
Louis Vuitton is passé.

48:35.880 --> 48:38.121
Chanel is a necessity now.

48:38.520 --> 48:42.047
Oh no, the police, they caught me talking
on the phone.

48:50.320 --> 48:52.049
Police! Get down on the floor!

48:52.200 --> 48:53.361
Get the fuck down!

48:53.560 --> 48:55.528
Hands on the wheel!

48:55.760 --> 48:57.728
Get down, get down!

48:58.000 --> 48:59.650
- Lie down, lie down!
- Watch the shoes!

48:59.760 --> 49:04.641
Don't move, don't move!

49:05.000 --> 49:07.082
Don't damage the shoes! They're Manolo!

49:13.440 --> 49:14.521
Fuck.

49:20.360 --> 49:21.407
Glasses.

49:25.720 --> 49:27.290
Police, police! Get down!

49:27.520 --> 49:29.204
Hands! Look at me!

49:29.520 --> 49:31.124
Look at me! Don't move!

49:31.320 --> 49:32.526
Turn your head to the left.

49:34.680 --> 49:37.411
I'll make sure the police doesn't touch
the drugs.

49:37.720 --> 49:38.767
We'll fix the door.

49:39.200 --> 49:41.089
I'll set up surveillance cameras.

49:41.520 --> 49:44.046
Somebody will come back for the drugs and
we'll follow them.

49:46.320 --> 49:47.321
First!

49:47.440 --> 49:48.441
No, no.

49:48.600 --> 49:49.601
That's cheating.

49:49.720 --> 49:50.846
But I was first.

49:51.040 --> 49:52.690
Che... eat... ing.

49:52.840 --> 49:54.285
- Ch... eat...
- Mom?

49:58.520 --> 49:59.567
Miss Ania, what happened?

50:00.880 --> 50:03.042
They ruined my fur.

50:03.760 --> 50:04.807
Five bullets.

50:05.720 --> 50:06.767
Go to your room.

50:13.640 --> 50:15.847
Someone told the police. Some bastard.
Fucking wanker.

50:16.520 --> 50:17.519
Who?

50:17.520 --> 50:19.719
They don't know. Some pussy.

50:19.720 --> 50:20.767
What about Zywy?

50:21.080 --> 50:23.048
No contact, boss. There's one more problem.

50:24.320 --> 50:25.367
What fucking problem?

50:26.440 --> 50:27.521
Your daughter, Sir.

50:42.520 --> 50:43.521
Fuck.

50:43.640 --> 50:45.847
What the fuck.. What the fuck are you
doing?

50:46.160 --> 50:47.810
Get the fuck out.

50:53.400 --> 50:56.006
I don't wanna go home, I want to fuck
someone!

50:57.400 --> 50:58.401
Get in.

50:58.440 --> 50:59.805
Don't you find me attractive?

51:05.760 --> 51:10.288
I want to have sex with you, you, you!

51:11.360 --> 51:13.408
- I really, really wanna have sex with...
- Boss, what about this motherfucker?

51:13.600 --> 51:14.647
Is he wasted as well?

51:15.400 --> 51:16.447
Yes.

51:17.440 --> 51:18.521
Send him to hell.

51:19.520 --> 51:20.646
But don't kill him.

52:00.400 --> 52:05.088
A car has just ploughed into pedestrians.

52:06.080 --> 52:07.127
Go.

52:11.800 --> 52:12.847
Are you crazy?

52:14.800 --> 52:15.847
I've put the rubber...

52:16.520 --> 52:17.567
on the smoke detector.

52:18.560 --> 52:19.607
Waste of money.

52:20.360 --> 52:21.521
We can afford it. Want some?

52:21.640 --> 52:22.687
Fucking kid.

52:37.160 --> 52:38.207
I have a surprise for you.

52:38.320 --> 52:39.367
What is it?

53:03.320 --> 53:04.731
Holy shit, what a beautiful view.

53:05.440 --> 53:06.521
It's gonna get even better.

53:06.522 --> 53:07.567
Promise?

53:14.120 --> 53:15.167
I'll buy this yacht.

53:16.600 --> 53:18.125
What the fuck do we need a yacht for?

53:18.800 --> 53:20.529
We'll sail to the end of the world.

53:21.280 --> 53:22.327
We'll fuck,

53:23.160 --> 53:24.321
and admire the views.

53:27.120 --> 53:28.167
Nice.

53:28.600 --> 53:29.647
And then what?

53:30.640 --> 53:33.291
We'll sail in a circle.

53:34.320 --> 53:35.526
The Earth is round.

53:36.720 --> 53:37.767
We love each other...

53:39.600 --> 53:41.204
We'll have to make a baby,

53:42.320 --> 53:44.766
so they can bring us drinks to bed.

54:21.720 --> 54:23.245
All right, she will sleep now.

54:24.200 --> 54:25.247
How long?

54:25.640 --> 54:27.563
After the stuff I gave her, 7-8 hours.

54:28.760 --> 54:30.125
How many times has this happened?

54:30.600 --> 54:31.681
This is the first time.

54:32.600 --> 54:34.523
To be honest, I don't fucking know.

54:35.360 --> 54:36.885
It'll be a difficult couple of days.

54:37.400 --> 54:38.686
Then she'll be healthy, right?

54:40.800 --> 54:42.211
Sir, what do you know about drugs?

54:42.520 --> 54:44.329
Nothing. What the fuck am I supposed to
know?

54:47.840 --> 54:49.205
You should read up on it.

54:50.360 --> 54:51.600
Call me if you need anything.

54:56.560 --> 54:59.211
Took Maciek to school, went grocery
shopping... Here's the receipt.

54:59.360 --> 55:01.681
Quiet! My head...

55:03.880 --> 55:05.962
Fermented cabbage juice is the best for a
hangover.

55:08.160 --> 55:11.767
Get that shit away from me.
Superstitions...

55:13.080 --> 55:16.527
I need a Balinese head massage.

55:17.640 --> 55:19.290
I can run a bath for you.

55:19.560 --> 55:23.281
Screw your bath, I wanna go to a spa!

55:27.280 --> 55:28.327
Miss Ania,

55:29.640 --> 55:31.005
you can't afford it,

55:31.560 --> 55:34.086
because the police blocked all of your
husband's bank accounts.

55:34.200 --> 55:35.440
Kill me.

55:36.520 --> 55:39.171
I don't want to live any more. I can't
live like this.

55:39.720 --> 55:43.691
Wake me up! This can't be real, it must
be a dream.

55:44.880 --> 55:49.841
Then sleep! Sleep! Sleep! I wanna sleep!

55:51.800 --> 55:52.847
You bitch!

55:53.040 --> 55:54.530
Calm the fuck down.

55:54.720 --> 55:56.529
You have a child. Pull yourself together.

55:58.720 --> 56:01.849
Don't you have any, like, hidden money?

56:03.000 --> 56:04.240
I don't know; I only spend it.

56:04.600 --> 56:07.365
Husbands usually sign the money over to
their wives.

56:08.520 --> 56:10.648
Mine wouldn't do that. He knows I'd blow
it all.

56:12.280 --> 56:13.327
All right...

56:14.120 --> 56:16.771
Then where could he hide the money from
you?

56:18.000 --> 56:19.047
He didn't say.

56:19.640 --> 56:20.687
Then we will ask him.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.047
Hello!

56:36.240 --> 56:38.208
Excuse me, sir!

56:39.160 --> 56:40.889
My husband is in there!

56:41.280 --> 56:43.009
Artur Ostrowski!

56:43.520 --> 56:47.286
Could you ask him if he's left any money
for us?!

56:49.280 --> 56:51.089
Please!

56:55.280 --> 56:56.327
All right, get off.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.047
It didn't work.

57:08.120 --> 57:09.121
Yes?

57:09.200 --> 57:10.201
Hello, I'm the courier.

57:10.202 --> 57:11.247
Come in.

57:17.080 --> 57:18.525
Nothing but obstacles.

57:44.640 --> 57:45.687
Come!

57:46.000 --> 57:47.047
Come!

57:51.240 --> 57:52.890
Maciek, hold this for mommy.

57:56.320 --> 57:57.367
Artur!

58:00.440 --> 58:01.521
Artur!

58:02.040 --> 58:03.201
What the fuck did you do?!

58:03.520 --> 58:05.887
Why didn't you leave me any money?!

58:06.200 --> 58:09.363
I can't even afford a beautician!

58:09.680 --> 58:11.682
Can't get away from her shouting even
here. Fuck.

58:12.200 --> 58:17.161
You'll see - when they let you out, you
won't get any pussy for half a year!

58:18.800 --> 58:21.371
They shot through my fur!

58:22.280 --> 58:25.090
I had to sell my Chanel bag!

58:25.280 --> 58:26.327
Ania, that's enough.

58:27.600 --> 58:29.090
Tell me, right now!

58:29.520 --> 58:32.808
Where's the money?! Where did you stash
the money, Artur?!

58:33.560 --> 58:35.289
Call the police on this woman.

58:35.640 --> 58:39.247
Where is the money from Wotka Kosowska?

58:39.760 --> 58:40.807
Do you know her?

58:42.640 --> 58:43.880
Yes, she's my wife.

58:44.440 --> 58:45.521
I'll introduce you.

58:45.840 --> 58:46.887
Ania.

58:47.080 --> 58:48.127
Czarek.

58:50.600 --> 58:52.523
Suck a dick!

58:59.560 --> 59:03.531
This is too difficult. It's too difficult
for you.

59:13.360 --> 59:14.566
Hey...

59:14.720 --> 59:15.767
Some guy.

59:16.600 --> 59:17.647
Your husband sent him.

59:18.080 --> 59:19.127
Did you let him in?

59:19.400 --> 59:20.606
Yeah, he said it's something important.

59:20.760 --> 59:23.730
Fucking hell, I need to get dressed.

59:32.760 --> 59:33.807
This is what I needed.

59:34.640 --> 59:36.324
There might be something else you need...

59:39.760 --> 59:40.807
ls this what you wanted?

59:41.280 --> 59:42.645
I'm not an expert in pork.

59:43.120 --> 59:44.326
Cieniu said it's green.

59:44.560 --> 59:45.891
It's Maciek's pocket money.

59:52.840 --> 59:53.887
Fuck off.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:04.126
Holy shit, Maciek stashed away a lot of
money.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.523
Cieniu said there should be ten grand.

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:08.367
Thank you.

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:10.406
I'll take this to Cieniu.

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:11.607
All of it?

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:16.161
Deception has a price. Steroids. Credit.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:17.681
Dope.

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:19.640
The chatterbox will pass it on.

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:20.847
What?

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.888
The lawyer will give him the money during
the visit.

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:26.167
What about me?

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:27.847
And Maciek?

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:29.770
What about alimony?

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:31.247
That's the other issue.

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.284
You'll have to earn the money by selling
the goods.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:34.521
What goods?

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.609
There's a key attached to Cieniu's car
keys.

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.081
A key to some apartment.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:43.249
There, you will find something you can
transport to Sweden and sell.

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.409
The instructions are written in the note.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.360
You gave him all of the money?

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.410
Since when are we on first name terms?

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.406
Since you've stopped paying me.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:06.604
Go away then. Why are you here?

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:07.887
I like your son.

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:12.002
Even if there is something here to sell,
how are you going to get to Sweden?

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:17.369
You're kind of right. I didn't think
about it.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:18.601
I didn't think.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:22.441
Fuck.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:26.809
I'll get the money back. I'll sacrifice
myself. Where's my phone?

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:38.081
What's up?

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:43.770
Don't take the money to my husband, bring
it back to me.

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.522
What's the reason for your change mind?

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.204
You.

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:05.202
Holy shit, I've never had sex with such
an ugly guy.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.646
You didn't have to give him pussy. You
could've used your head.

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:20.087
I gave him head, too.

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:24.091
Is this definitely the right road?

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.443
Konopackiej 18.

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:29.647
You said "Konopnickiej".

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:32.320
Anyone could get such a fucked up name
wrong.

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:35.570
I should live in Paris, because I don't
confuse names like "Chanel".

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.119
Cieniu's wife.

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.246
All right, let's go.

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.766
Fucking hell.

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.609
This ain't coke, it's speed.

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.087
Leave it.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.446
We're leaving.

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.201
Leaving.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.001
We're leaving.

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.361
I have to transport this.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.167
What the hell?

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.567
You have a child!

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:06.527
You can't smuggle drugs into Sweden.

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:08.451
But I don't have any money.

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.365
How will I get myself a lawyer?

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:12.444
How will I feed Maciek?

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:14.207
Are you mental?

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:16.927
I have to do it.

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:21.200
You have to help me. Please. This money
would last us a few years.

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:23.085
It wouldn't last you a month.

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.045
Maybe you don't want to do it for me,

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.844
but do it for Maciek.

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:30.687
- Fuck, I don't want to listen to this.
- You won't have to touch any of it.

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.724
I'll transport it. Understood?

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.690
You don't have to do anything.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.164
Just come with me, please. Look, this
tells us everything we need to do.

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:40.685
Do you understand?

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:44.242
Did it not occur to you that the
police could be observing this house?

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:47.688
They will arrest us as soon as we leave
the building.

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:51.004
I'll let you keep a hundred grand.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:56.560
Come on, let's have a little.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.447
Pack the bags.

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.324
She's carrying the goods,
should we pinch her?

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:25.171
Follow her. She'll pass it on and we'll
arrest all of them.

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.001
Miss Ania!

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.525
You were gone for a long time.

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:48.926
I'm happy to be back, too. What's new?

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:50.081
My brother is getting married.

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:51.366
Awesome!

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:52.841
Do you have anything I'd like?

01:05:52.842 --> 01:05:53.887
We do...

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.599
Look.

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.647
Wow.

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.290
Four fucking hours.

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:06.251
Excuse me, gentlemen.

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:09.682
I'm looking for a real man.

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:12.647
- Then you should speak to my friend.
- What's the issue?

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:14.086
I'm knackered.

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:18.962
All this shopping... There are two
shopping malls left. Could you help me?

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:20.366
Just carry this to my car.

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:24.806
Sweetie.

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.681
She wants to go to two more shopping malls.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:40.767
Oh dear, I forgot the laundry.

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:43.647
You must help me, gentlemen. My arms are
tired.

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.650
All right, that's it. Arrest her.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:54.409
Internal Security Agency. Turn around and
put your hands on the car.

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:25.366
My husband said you'll help us pack up.

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:27.045
I'll hold it.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:39.890
We're going to Sweden!

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:50.043
The note said that crossing the
Swedish border is just a formality,

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.043
they won't search you.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.767
How did we get fooled by two bimbos?

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:02.521
Who is this?

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:06.521
We need to bug Cieniu's wife's house.

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:32.001
Why is this taking so long?

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:36.442
The code word from the note is not working.

01:08:38.319 --> 01:08:40.287
Go check if you're not in the bathroom.

01:08:40.439 --> 01:08:41.805
Where's the bathroom?

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:43.804
Fuck knows.

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:45.846
Fuck?

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:50.809
Fuck.

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:17.880
It's going well.

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:19.609
Is it? So where's the money?

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:33.970
Fuck.

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:36.125
Fuck.

01:09:36.399 --> 01:09:38.448
Why do you keep saying "fuck“?

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.929
The money is in Copenhagen.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.571
Is that far?

01:09:43.439 --> 01:09:45.203
It's in Denmark, for fucks sake.

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:47.569
Where's Denmark?

01:09:51.359 --> 01:09:53.328
No chance. They'll find the drugs in the
car.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.810
Then maybe we should try selling it here.

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.525
We need to take it out.

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:03.367
And?

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:12.127
I'll put the drugs in my backpack
and get across the border by train.

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:15.727
The consul said a lot of people take
the train to work in the morning.

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.768
Copenhagen?

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:44.247
Norrebro?

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:22.011
Fucking awesome!

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:58.765
These Danes are pretty hot.

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:01.851
What are they like...

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:04.370
- you know, down there?
- What?

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.683
Like liverwursts or chipolatas,

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:09.247
these Danes?

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:11.325
Fucking focus.

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.161
Stop.

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:44.241
Wait here.

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:21.405
Run the bath for me.

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:22.561
Do it yourself.

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:25.286
This is what happens when you get too
familiar with the nanny.

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:26.807
Fuck.

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:31.730
What are you doing in my apartment?

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:33.684
You have something that belongs to me.

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:35.607
But this money is mine.

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:37.727
Really?

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:39.521
And my husband's.

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:42.045
Your husband works for me.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.250
This is for the trouble.

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:56.205
Fuck.

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:03.328
Oddaj mi to. Fucking let go.

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:04.721
Give me this.

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:07.210
Fuck off.

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.522
Fuck off.

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:14.567
Calm down.

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:16.247
Take this.

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.607
Calm down.

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:28.447
Fuck.

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:32.127
Fuck off.

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:27.847
Open the door!

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:29.440
I can't, dad.

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:31.320
I'm naked.

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:34.882
Open the fucking door!

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.770
Open the fucking door!

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:43.524
- Daddy, come later.
- Kacper.

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:47.167
Break down the door.

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:53.289
Dad, why did you bust the door open?

01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:55.327
Where is it?

01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:57.526
It's fucking here.

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:04.006
Fuck, where did you get this shit from?

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:07.648
I'm not telling you, thief.

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:11.009
Shoot me, fucker. Dickhead. Wanker.

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:14.521
Boss.

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.842
We should try a different tactic against
Padrino.

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:26.807
Like what?

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:29.727
He has a weak spot.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:32.567
His daughter.

01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:38.521
She was sent to a rehab clinic.

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:43.085
Joanna Pawelec is her therapist.

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:46.206
Years ago, she got drunk and killed
somebody. We helped her.

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:48.284
She's our facility agent.

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:50.886
We rented a medical office, and created a
fake history of practices.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:54.010
Joanna will teach you a quick lesson on
therapy.

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.688
She will let you in and you'll build a
relationship with Padrino's daughter.

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:00.165
I would like to introduce somebody.

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:01.521
This is Dorota.

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:03.165
She will spend some time with us.

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:04.961
She's doing an internship.

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:07.003
Hi Dorota.

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:08.521
Hi.

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:11.520
All right, where did we finish?

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:13.531
Maciek, you'll be late to school.

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:15.321
Mom isn't waking up.

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:16.767
Mom.

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:18.127
Mom.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.526
Fuck off.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.369
Everything's all right. Go to your room.

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:32.126
And wait for me, okay?

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:41.003
Calm the fuck down.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.650
Give me a tablet.

01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:54.127
No.

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:57.842
Give me the fucking tablet!

01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.206
No.

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:00.605
You slept for 14 hours.

01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:02.170
I beg you.

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:04.127
Here.

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:05.607
Here.

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:11.127
Here, take your fucking tablets, here,
here, here...

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:25.330
Please wait.

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:31.564
We would like to work...

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:33.764
We would like to work for you.

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.001
Why should I trust you?

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:46.168
We want to do the same thing...

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:49.568
as Cieniu. We need to.

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.568
With Cieniu's wife, the
moron who doesn't know

01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:59.291
what her husband has been
doing for the past 1O years?

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:01.727
This is why I'm the one talking to you.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.891
Marie Curie discovered radium and polonium,
and you think women can't make drugs?

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.886
- 'Copernicus was also a woman'.
- You're sexist.

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:17.840
Cieniu...

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:21.405
did many different things for me.

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:23.521
You can't replace him.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:26.647
Can I go to the toilet?

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:28.847
Show her the way.

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:39.567
Should I shoot him?

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:41.649
To show you that I have no problem with it?

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:49.686
She has balls.

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.450
That's sexist, too.

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:53.681
Show her how this works.

01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:59.369
Why are you so quiet, miss?

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:01.367
What do you have?

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:04.607
Fuck all.

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:06.567
Could you repeat that?

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.525
Fuck all, I'm not an alcoholic.

01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:12.610
Do you eat three cakes,

01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:14.888
drink mustard and throw it up, or
do you play the Sims until dawn?

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:18.044
Maybe you purchased 40 bags using loan
money?

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:20.244
Pills, speed, weed? What is it?

01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:23.204
This place is for all of these, princess!

01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:26.329
Fuck all, you dirty old cunt!

01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:29.603
Seems like you've not had dick
in a long while, fuck off!

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:38.324
I want my phone! Do you fucking hear me?!

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:40.681
It's safe here.

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:41.887
Give it back, bitch!

01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:44.323
Or I will take it back myself. Understood?

01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:45.647
You will?

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:48.127
You will get it back in a
month, when you transfer

01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:50.521
to the day ward. Right now
it's where it belongs.

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:51.727
Fuck!

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:56.561
You are relaxed and free from stress.

01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:01.250
You are relaxed and free from stress.

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:06.607
Want a smoke?

01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:11.289
I can't stand this place.

01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:15.768
What's the problem? You can just leave.

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.651
You're staying here voluntarily.

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:19.766
Dad would punish me.

01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:24.326
Do you take private patients?

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:27.847
Will you help me?

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:31.567
No.

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:36.170
You must help yourself.

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:40.525
A therapist can be your guide, but you
have to trust them.

01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:43.044
All right, I trust you. Give me the phone.

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:48.450
Sorry, that's against the rules.

01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:53.285
If you want me to trust you, you're going
to have to trust me.

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:58.041
I see you get by pretty well in life.

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:01.800
Who do you want to call?

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:04.011
God the father.

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:09.321
Daddy, it's me.

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:10.931
Where do you think I'm calling from?

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:12.644
From the shithole you locked me in.

01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:15.450
I'm not up to anything, I promise.

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:20.204
I met someone who can help me. Seriously.

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:23.728
You have to agree, or else I'll fucking
run away and you'll never see me again.

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:27.727
Help me, daddy. I beg you.

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:30.921
Open a new amphetamine
factory every week.

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.969
The cops won't be able
to locate you this way.

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:34.850
Find an old rentable farm.

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:36.851
Miss, why do you want this barn?

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:38.530
I'll open a soap factory.

01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:49.521
All the equipment needed to produce speed
costs only 45 grand.

01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:52.641
Never transport the whole set in one car.

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:55.525
If the cops stop you, you'll be done for.

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:58.331
Separate the equipment and transport it
in different cars.

01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:02.411
They won't be able to do shit.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.650
When will we start making it?

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:07.041
We can't start without benzyl methyl
ketone.

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:09.601
In three days, we will get three tonnes
of BMK.

01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:10.839
From Ukraine?

01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:11.841
You don't need to know.

01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:13.006
We can make this ourselves.

01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:15.328
Why should we pay 500 euros for 1 liter?

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:16.841
You know how to?

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:18.450
I didn't get my doctorate for nothing.

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:19.601
It's only a matter of money.

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:20.807
We'll think about it.

01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:23.646
Where do we get the BMK from?

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:28.448
You can get the semi - finished product
legally from fake cosmetics factories.

01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:42.923
Your daughter wants to wish you a good
night.

01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:44.127
How does she feel?

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:47.281
She had an anxiety attack. I gave her
some hydroxyzine.

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.366
Kacper will take you back.

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:50.521
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:23:50.522 --> 01:23:51.885
Of course.

01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:01.768
Come, come. Calm down, calm down.

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:04.845
Wash your hands.

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:07.448
Calm down. I'm pulling up your sleeves.

01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:24.841
The brain is now focusing on the running
water, not the anxiety.

01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:27.284
I shifted your focus to different stimuli.

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:33.523
This is a very effective method of
combating panic attacks.

01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:38.324
How should I talk to her?

01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:41.090
Just say "goodnight, sweetheart“.

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:44.091
Allow yourself to love her.

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:46.927
Goodnight.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.047
Goodnight.

01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:03.567
Are we going?

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:05.526
Hydroxyzine, for your boss.

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:14.681
Ania.

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:17.087
Ania.

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:18.647
Time for breakfast.

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:22.531
Where am I?

01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:24.201
At home, in bed.

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:26.207
You should eat something.

01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:28.171
Got the tablet?

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:34.522
It's 12pm, we should let some sun in.

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:38.768
Give me the fucking tablet.

01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:42.091
Maciek is taking part in a spelling bee
competition today.

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:45.287
Give me the tablet.

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:47.407
What tablet?

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:52.083
Stop staring at me! Fuck!

01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:07.805
Please, please, the tablet.

01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:12.727
Hello.

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:14.530
What's the matter? I'm in a hurry.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.445
I brought you a present.

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:19.880
First batch. -Fuck, are you insane?!

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:21.840
I don't want this in my house.

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:23.800
- I thought...
- Don't think.

01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:26.404
Thinking will get you killed. Do you want
to live?

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:27.567
Yes.

01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:30.648
Then get the fuck out, and come back with
the money.

01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:42.529
Get someone to install a GPS tracker.

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:43.721
On whose car?

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:46.087
Thanks to the bug I planted,

01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:48.363
I heard that the nanny is producing the
drugs.

01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:49.767
Ignore it.

01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:51.567
Wait, what?

01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:54.808
There will be a more interesting subject
tomorrow.

01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.010
But what's stopping us from...

01:26:58.600 --> 01:26:59.647
I won't repeat myself.

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:22.687
What happened?

01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:25.325
I don't know. Mom went crazy.

01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:29.046
Who called the ambulance?

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:30.407
I was afraid.

01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:32.930
Everything is all right, you hear me?

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:34.561
Everything is OK.

01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:35.647
Miss, do you live here?

01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:37.521
Yes.

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:39.682
What happened, why is she unconscious?

01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:40.881
She had a seizure.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.809
Did she take any legal highs, or drugs?

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:45.807
I don't know, she gets nervous, but I
don't know.

01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:47.687
Please sign here.

01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:51.807
Why is there blood?

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.047
She bit my hand.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.047
Thank you.

01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:08.207
Yes?

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:10.887
Do you know this man?

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:12.201
No.

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:13.407
Who is this?

01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:17.842
Alias Szarak. He worked for Zywy. He
exchanged the money from ztoty into euros.

01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:20.531
Money from Wotka Kosowska?

01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:24.444
Zywy was impatient. He wanted to exchange
it all in one go.

01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:28.363
And Szarak got busted?

01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:32.647
He would receive a reduced sentence if he
exposes Zywy.

01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:34.847
Is Zywy alive?

01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:04.648
Look at me, look at me.
I love you.

01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:09.042
Look at me, look at me.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.001
What a life, eh?

01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:15.207
Yeah.

01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:16.567
Crazy.

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:18.567
Come, let's dance.

01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:20.211
You fucking know I don't dance.

01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:22.881
You'll dance with me.

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:24.081
No.

01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:26.606
- Come on.
- No.

01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:17.207
Fuck.

01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:24.164
Why did I have to fall so hard for you?

01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:27.401
I met the most wonderful woman on earth
and look how it ends...

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:28.726
It doesn't have to end.

01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:30.970
Be a witness. Change last names.

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:32.521
They'll help us move.

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:19.648
You will let us keep the bag with the
money.

01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:24.088
And you'll let my woman out for a few
hours.

01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:25.567
Give her the bag.

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:27.051
Do not follow her.

01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:29.842
In a few hours, Siekiera will return.

01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:35.287
You want us to let you keep the money
stolen from Wotka Kosowska?

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:38.565
Yes, or no deal.

01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:41.605
Sir, why are you so sure about this?

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:48.521
You want me to expose Padrino and his
group.

01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:51.288
Why are you so sure your woman will
return to you?

01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:55.526
Prosecutor...

01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:58.125
Looks like you've never been in love.

01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:08.370
Who allowed her to take the money?

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:10.167
Nobody.

01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:11.726
She's being led by two squads,

01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:13.721
the taxi driver is ours,

01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:16.650
and there's a tracker in the bag. Let the
bitch bury the bag.

01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:20.008
We will dig it out and come back here.

01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:25.525
You're screwed.

01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:28.160
You'll stay in jail for the rest of your
shitty life! Your woman deceived you!

01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:29.367
Yeah, right.

01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:31.727
She's back.

01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:33.727
Without the bag.

01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:41.441
Congratulations.

01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:44.530
The world will remember you as the
prosecutor who locked up Padrino.

01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:05.167
Boss.

01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:08.201
What's wrong?

01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:09.930
The counter-terrorists came to visit.

01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:14.329
Hide in the basement. I don't know how many
I can fuck up, but I won't let them all in.

01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:15.567
Put it away.

01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:43.641
Goodbye, sweetheart.

01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:47.364
I don't know when I'll be back. Don't
listen to the things they'll say about me.

01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:49.085
What? Dad, what's going on?

01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:51.368
Get dressed, I don't want them to see you
like this.

01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:52.646
What? Dad?

01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:54.207
Dad, what's happening?

01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:56.359
Dad!

01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:58.089
- Don't go there.
- Fuck off.

01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:01.207
Dad!

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:02.727
Dad!

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:12.567
Dad.

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:16.520
Calm down, calm down.

01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:26.408
Police! Get down, get down!

01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:29.040
Get down! Hands!

01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:32.609
After the trial, you will assume new
identities and move abroad.

01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:35.047
We will help you hide until the trial.

01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:37.680
We will sign you into police school.
You will pretend to be police officers,

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:39.808
and the security staff will
be with you all the time.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.047
Wake up at 6am.

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:42.611
Breakfast is at 6:20am.

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:44.406
You can skip the assembly.

01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:48.211
And then what?

01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:49.526
You have books and checkers.

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:52.402
Fuck, this is worse than the prison in
Biatoteka.

01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:56.005
Tone down the enthusiasm. The curfew is
at 10pm.

01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:57.811
And don't fuck after the whistle.

01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:06.528
Your mom said she doesn't want to see you.

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:08.567
I'm sorry.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.731
I'll go and talk to her for a bit. Can
you stay with this lady?

01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:24.607
Why are you alone?

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.321
The little one caught the flu, so he had
to stay at home.

01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:30.811
Get me out of here. Please, do something.

01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:32.406
Soon, Ania.

01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:33.726
I won't survive this.

01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:37.444
Some woman bashed another's head against
the floor.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:43.131
I'm stuck with some psycho who stays up
all night and stares at me.

01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:45.528
I'm scared she's going to hurt me.

01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:49.362
Here are the tablets.

01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:51.530
Inside the jam.

01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:57.567
You'll tough it out.

01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:11.088
Excuse me miss, my phone died. Could you
tell me how to get to the town hall?

01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:17.282
There is a GPS tracker under the door on
the right.

01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:19.601
Who planted it?

01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:21.290
Doesn't matter. It won't happen again.

01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:23.087
Thank you.

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:24.807
Is this your son?

01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:26.521
Hello.

01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:30.807
Cute kid.

01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:32.801
Get in the car.

01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:27.128
Drive safely and follow the rules of the
road so you don't get stopped by the cops.

01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:55.881
I want to report that there are three
buses filled with amphetamine,

01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:58.647
on the ferry going to Sweden from Gdynia.

01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:03.290
Stop the couriers when they unload. They
are members of a large cell led by a woman.

01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:20.606
You're from Poland.

01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:23.409
What should I do? Please tell me.

01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:27.523
Cooperate with the police. Sweden gives
harsh penalties for drug dealing.

01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:30.770
These police officers know you were
transporting it for somebody else.

01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:34.561
They know you work for some woman. They
want you to give evidence against her.

01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:35.927
So?

01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:37.281
Will you tell us about her?

01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:39.327
I want protection.

01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:45.763
Daria, Daria.

01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:50.525
Daria, I had to go pee and I saw them
through the window.

01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:00.847
What are they doing here?

01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:06.167
They have come for me.

01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:08.290
We won't see each other for a long time.

01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:10.204
I love you.

01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:19.130
I'm alone with a child.

01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:21.529
Don't do anything crazy, I'm opening the
door.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:25.889
The cops have come for me. Look after the
kid.

01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:10.362
Listen. They know there's a kid in here,

01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:12.768
so they won't throw stun grenades.

01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:15.089
They will just make a lot of noise.

01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:18.606
They will break the windows, but don't be
afraid. All right?

01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:20.246
I love you.

01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:22.166
Lie down like me.

01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:26.127
Don't be afraid.

01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:27.721
Don't be afraid.

01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:37.010
Police! Police!

01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:44.321
Sir, pull up my shirt strap.

01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:46.649
Sit still, somebody will come for you soon.

01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:51.806
Fucking pull it up, I won't bite your
hand off.

01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:53.647
Sit quietly.

01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:56.882
How can I sit quietly with my boob showing?

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:14.767
Fuck.

01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:19.521
Prosecutor.

01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:21.567
Good afternoon.

01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:29.449
There's enough evidence inside this
briefcase to send you down for 15 years.

01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:33.251
This is the lady's lawyer, he will sit in
during the interrogation.

01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:34.601
Good afternoon.

01:42:34.602 --> 01:42:36.090
When did you call him?

01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:42.326
Hello. Tomasz Widarski.

01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:48.649
This will be a long interrogation,
would you like to go to the bathroom?

01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:49.801
Yes.

01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:50.967
Please go with the lady.

01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:07.807
Let's begin.

01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:13.685
Call an ambulance!

01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:19.885
Please hand me the medical record.

01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:33.282
Permanent brain damage.

01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:35.966
Further proceedings in this
case would be pointless.

01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:39.210
We can't bring charges against her. We
have to drop the case.

01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:44.207
Hey.

01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:46.010
I filed for divorce.

01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:49.280
Bartek wants to live with me, so don't
cause us any problems.

01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:52.207
Listen...

01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:54.284
I'll come over, we'll talk.

01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:56.126
There is nothing to talk about.

01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:00.010
I won't let you take Bartek from me.

01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:02.245
Mom, it's me.

01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:03.567
Hello darling.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:08.085
I just wanted to tell you that I'm
staying with dad. Bye.

01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:13.888
Your security clearance has been revoked.

01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:15.281
Why?

01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:16.401
Because fuck you, that's why.

01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:17.646
You're fucking fired.

01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:19.564
We've initiated proceedings against you.

01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:22.964
Do you think you can make me give up now?

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.047
I think I can.

01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:27.647
You have a family, a house, a husband.

01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:29.521
A child.

01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:37.851
I don't have anything any more.

01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:02.681
How did this happen?

01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:06.567
A motherfucking miracle.

01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:08.167
It's a miracle.

01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:25.687
Hello, boys.

01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:26.927
What are you doing here?

01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:28.805
We need to relocate the factory.

01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:30.925
You don't own this factory any more.

01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:32.327
I don't?

01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:33.641
Then who owns it?

01:45:33.642 --> 01:45:35.608
The Zoliborz mafia came here and claimed
it.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.765
They said they will take Padrino's place
and take over Mokotow.

01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:43.290
Bullshit. I'm staying here. Finish what
you're doing and we'll wrap this mess up.

01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:53.007
Thanks for putting me to sleep.

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:22.441
Give me back all the money you've made on
my territory.

01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:25.766
If you don't return it by Friday,
we'll cut the kid's fingers off.

01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:27.285
And then his willy.
And we'll stuff it in your mouth.

01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:30.205
Are you done yet? I have to do the laundry.

01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:35.685
Time for the down payment, you slag.

01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:39.847
What?

01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:42.168
You have three holes, and there's three
of us.

01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:46.370
You'll suck our cocks.

01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:49.447
Who's first?

01:46:56.240 --> 01:46:58.686
You. The smallest.

01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:11.361
I'm done with this.

01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:12.607
Did something happen?

01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:14.531
The fucking fuse blew.

01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:16.607
Let's meet up.

01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:18.247
Fuck off.

01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:22.841
Right, fucking right, left...

01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:24.525
Don't smoke inside.

01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:27.367
Why not?

01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:28.847
It's not allowed.

01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:31.367
Shall we go somewhere?

01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:33.647
The buffet,

01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:35.887
library,

01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:37.807
or the laundry room?

01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:40.124
Are you going to just fucking sit here?

01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:42.087
I'm standing.

01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:46.204
I fucking told you not to smoke here.

01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:53.287
Time for a quickie?

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.525
I'm not in the mood.

01:47:57.720 --> 01:47:59.688
If I had an AK, I'd fuck them all up.

01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:04.727
And then what?

01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:15.609
Shit, Zywy. If people survived the war,
we can survive this.

01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:18.087
People are like pigs,

01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:20.563
we can adapt to anything, eh?

01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:27.559
Fuck.

01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:28.607
What?

01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:32.046
Stop, fucking stop it.

01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:45.731
I knew you were stronger than me.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:56.369
What's the point? They're just driving in
fucking circles.

01:48:57.040 --> 01:48:58.087
Just like I do.

01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:00.089
In your fucking cage.

01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:02.927
What do you want?

01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:09.003
I don't want to ruin my life.

01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:13.406
You've already ruined it once.

01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:14.851
Stop it. Fuck.

01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:19.850
You pulled me out of one shitpile and put
me in another. I'm fucking off.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.047
What about the boy?

01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:28.890
I'll be his mother.

01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:39.601
I can help you.

01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:43.768
I'll get you custody of the kid.

01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:48.404
You're elbow-deep in this shit.

01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:50.330
Are you going to give up now?

01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:51.887
You're so close.

01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:56.010
You would've been a great mother.

01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:07.450
I need a big gun.

01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:24.449
I need to see one of the prisoners.

01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:25.687
Oh, fuck.

01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:27.840
You owe me.

01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:49.207
How did you get in here?

01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:58.291
I worked for the IS A and spied on your
group.

01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:23.847
My boss eliminated you from the market.

01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:27.325
He took over the route to Scandinavia and
sells drugs.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.843
When I discovered this, he fired me.

01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:37.642
They fucked me over, so I'll fuck them
oven.

01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:46.089
I know where Zywy is, and he's going to
turn state's evidence.

01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:50.323
If you get rid of him, the charges will
be dropped and you'll be free.

01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:57.083
Can you guess why you didn't notice
anything?

01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:02.646
Because it was real.

01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:06.322
I really fell in love with you.

01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:10.649
You fucked up.

01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:13.522
Contact Kacper, Padrino's bodyguard.

01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:17.247
What do you want?

01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:20.649
I have the money, but let's meet in the
barn.

01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:22.327
Why the barn?

01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:26.967
I won't blow you in front of the kid.

01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:31.125
Last time was amazing.
Can all three of you come?

01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:32.760
I may be a bit of a masochist.

01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:40.045
What the fuck is this?

01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:42.528
It reeks of fucking shit out here.

01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:46.727
What's up, cunts?

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.047
Oh shit.

01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:55.805
Once upon a time there were three little
pigs, and a big bad wolf.

01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:01.607
We can work this out.

01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:03.520
We will work it out if...

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:05.889
you give each other blowjobs.

01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:09.680
You'll suck him off, and vice versa.

01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:12.443
Are you fucking insane? I'm not gay.

01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:16.600
Don't make such big deal out of it.
What's wrong with sucking a friend off?

01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:17.887
Come on, stop it.

01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:23.685
Suck his dick.

01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:35.570
- Suck it!
- I won't tell anybody, boss. It'll be ok.

01:53:35.800 --> 01:53:36.847
Fuck off.

01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:41.205
Fuck it. Here we go, boss.

01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:46.211
Oh shit.

01:53:58.600 --> 01:53:59.647
Nice.

01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:02.249
Fuck. Props to you.

01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:09.401
I enjoyed it.

01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:12.891
But I changed my mind.

01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:16.722
I'll let you go if you chop your buddy's
leg off.

01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:23.361
Hack it off, we've already exchanged
pleasantries.

01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:29.205
Cut it off, boss. Fuck it, I'll get a
prosthetic.

01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:31.404
Nobody will notice it through trousers.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.161
Oh, fuck.

01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:40.806
Hey, not there, any fool can do it there.

01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:42.521
On the thigh.

01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:44.006
Sorry, Kazek.

01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:49.444
Hack it, fuck!

01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:00.729
Hack it off!

01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:10.399
All right.

01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:12.402
Now, you just lie here quietly,

01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:14.651
him and I need to talk.

01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:17.840
Tell me Leon,

01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:21.200
how do you make your money?

01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:26.000
I already told you everything!

01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:27.521
I don't know.

01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:28.807
I don't fucking know.

01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:34.565
I swear! I swear on my mother's life!

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.889
Just let me go!

01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:38.407
Fine.

01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:43.687
I'll cut you free.

01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:54.566
You're free.

01:55:58.240 --> 01:55:59.526
Throw these two in there, too.

01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:16.322
Don't cry darling, things will get
cleared up soon.

01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:17.927
Will you tough it out?

01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:20.530
I'm afraid of myself.

01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:25.130
I'm alone with myself.

01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:29.363
I don't know what to do.

01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:34.207
Do you sing?

01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:36.444
How can I sing?

01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:41.171
Sing a song for me.

01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:43.567
Now?

01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:45.166
Do it for me.

01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:56.249
Happy birthday to you,

01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:06.088
happy birthday to you,

01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:12.523
happy birthday dear... daddy.

01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:24.160
Happy birthday to you.

01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:28.327
Thanks.

01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:37.321
Leave me alone..

01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:38.567
Give me a moment.

01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:41.163
I said leave me alone, fuck!

01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:43.124
It's all in your head.

01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:45.402
Nothing is right.

01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:48.241
It will all come together.

01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:51.643
You'll sell them by weight and we'll
disappear.

01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:53.526
Me, you and the dough.

01:57:54.120 --> 01:57:55.929
There will be more tango dancing. You'll
be...

01:57:56.120 --> 01:57:58.122
I'm a pussy, I sold my buddies out.

01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:02.165
I told you to stop!

01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:07.645
You're not fit to be a gangster.

01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:10.247
You're too soft.

01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:14.285
I'm too soft as well. That's why we get
our <i>asses</i> kicked.

01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:22.526
Get the fuck out.

01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:35.806
What's up, girl?

01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:37.525
We have to meet up.

01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:39.446
I don't have time for that.

01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:45.162
You promised you'd be by my side when I
need you. I just need a hug.

01:58:46.680 --> 01:58:47.727
Are you coming?

01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:49.567
No.

01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:53.528
You have to fucking come here, I need you!

01:58:54.520 --> 01:58:59.606
Get your shit together, you dumb twat.
And don't call me again. Understood?

01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:50.247
What is...?

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:38.570
Fucking hell! Shit!

02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:45.090
Oh fuck, Zywy, oh fuck, shit, fuck!

02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:15.167
I'll take this.

02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:16.766
Can I talk to her?

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:18.001
Not possible.

02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:19.206
She was taken to the emergency ward.

02:01:19.207 --> 02:01:20.201
What happened?

02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:21.407
She mutilated herself.

02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:27.806
I didn't do anything.

02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:29.207
Lie still, miss.

02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:38.286
I really didn't do anything.

02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:44.241
I have no choice but to
ask you to release the

02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:47.882
defendant from his
provisional detention.

02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:50.442
At this stage and with these circumstances,

02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:54.407
delivering the harshest sentence wouldn't
be appropriate.

02:01:54.680 --> 02:01:55.681
Congratulations.

02:01:55.682 --> 02:01:57.125
Thank you very much, sir.

02:01:57.360 --> 02:01:58.359
Boss.

02:01:58.360 --> 02:01:59.600
- What is it?
- Sandra.

02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:01.850
Fuck, what happened to my daughter?

02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:04.322
She's gone. She's dead. I'm sorry.

02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:24.000
We need an ambulance, a man is having a
seizure.

02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:00.359
Hello?

02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:01.805
We'll meet at 4pm in Hyatt.

02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:04.286
The card is at the reception.

02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:07.443
Miss, that woman was aggressive,

02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:09.887
we had good reasons to think
she's harming herself.

02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:12.202
You didn't recognise a fucking staph
infection?

02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:15.171
- What kind of hospital is this?
- Please calm down. -Fuck off.

02:03:25.680 --> 02:03:27.409
You're going home Ania.

02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:39.367
Different car?

02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:41.086
The other one broke down.

02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:45.970
I need to stop by the petrol station.

02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:48.203
Hurry. I want to see my son.

02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:12.250
I want to report that there's
a woman transporting drugs,

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:21.010
on Daszynskiego Road, with
the registration WT45414,

02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:29.890
and her name is Anna Danielak.

02:04:44.680 --> 02:04:47.286
Good morning. Police. Do you have any
luggage in the boot?

02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:48.441
What's going on?

02:04:48.640 --> 02:04:49.971
Please open the boot of the car.

02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:55.647
Take out the bag.

02:04:57.800 --> 02:04:58.847
Take it out, take it out.

02:05:01.640 --> 02:05:02.687
Open it, please.

02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:10.601
What is this? Milk powder? What is it?

02:05:11.840 --> 02:05:13.171
This isn't mine, I don't...

02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:14.807
You don't know?

02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:17.404
Hands, please. Quickly.

02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:19.046
- You bitch.
- Hands, quickly.

02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:21.884
- Hands.
- You bitch.

02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:26.040
You're coming with us.

02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:30.521
The other hand.

02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:36.447
Come.

02:05:40.040 --> 02:05:41.087
Watch your head.

02:05:43.440 --> 02:05:45.010
I would like to book a taxi.

02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:00.567
What's your name?

02:06:02.760 --> 02:06:04.330
What's your fucking name?

02:06:06.680 --> 02:06:07.727
Bela.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:09.047
Izabela.

02:06:09.440 --> 02:06:10.521
Konarska.

02:06:12.760 --> 02:06:13.886
Born in Zambrow.

02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:17.800
Unknown father.

02:06:19.800 --> 02:06:22.849
Prostitute mother, murdered by gangsters.

02:06:25.720 --> 02:06:28.087
The dismembered body was found in a forest.

02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:33.526
What was all this for?

02:06:35.080 --> 02:06:36.127
Izabela.

02:06:38.520 --> 02:06:40.010
History likes to repeat itself.

02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:42.726
Then make it repeat itself.

02:06:59.840 --> 02:07:01.365
Go ahead. Shoot.

02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:34.407
I love you.

02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:28.407
Look who's here.

02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:29.887
Dad!

02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:36.167
Hey, son.

02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:37.447
Hi.

02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:38.807
Did you miss me?

02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:42.329
Get dressed, we'll go to a playground.

02:08:42.520 --> 02:08:43.567
Dad, I'm 10 years old.

02:08:46.520 --> 02:08:48.045
Then let's play a video game.

02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:49.247
All right.

02:08:55.760 --> 02:08:56.886
Thank you very much.

02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:02.524
You can go home now. I'll give you a call
if I need more help.

02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:05.041
What do you mean?

02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:07.045
The kid needs a father.

02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:08.851
Please pass me a glass of water.

02:09:09.600 --> 02:09:10.601
Look, dad.

02:09:10.680 --> 02:09:11.681
What do we have here?

02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:14.810
Wait, I'll pause it. Here is the pedal,
and the brakes...

02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:25.605
- It's better to break at the turn.
- Look, look...

02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:40.607
Here you go.

02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:42.281
Thank you.

02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:48.321
Hello?

02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:52.650
Meet you at the bar downstairs in
15 minutes. Order green tea for me.

02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:36.567
You bitch.

02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:46.250
Somebody, call an ambulance!

02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:17.089
Would you like to work for me?

02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:24.443
Call the Zoliborz gang and tell them we
wanna meet up to discuss a few things.

02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:27.567
Tell them...

02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:32.007
we will free their boss, and the two
clowns from administration.

02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:35.727
Which one of us will go there?

02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:52.002
Who's in charge now?

02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:54.087
I am.

02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:05.164
Are you looking for your boss, and the
two clowns from administration?

02:12:10.640 --> 02:12:11.641
Here they are.

02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:14.406
What the fuck is this? Teeth?

02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:17.645
Sodium hydroxide dissolves everything but
the teeth.

02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:19.127
Sodium hydroxide?

02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:21.010
Teeth will always remain.

02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:24.041
I poured your boss,

02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:26.325
and the two clowns,

02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:28.760
out in a field.

02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:32.364
You either work for me,

02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:37.245
or you join your mates in the bag.

02:12:55.280 --> 02:12:56.691
What's it to you, dickhead wog?

02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:00.161
Justyna.

02:13:10.680 --> 02:13:11.681
Lead on, goat fucker.

02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:31.046
Surprise, cunt.

02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:34.087
Hello, my love.

02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:40.170
I'll rub that smile off your face.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.241
Did you wonder why I left you the folder?

02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:44.601
You missed me.

02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:46.567
Very much.

02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:49.164
I missed you so much I could kill you.

02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:52.525
Meet my new husbands.

02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:05.046
Numil, Abdul, Zahir, Mustafa, Rashad, Ali.

02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:14.927
Is this what you want?

02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:18.367
This is what I want.

02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:22.567
Then watch carefully.

02:14:24.520 --> 02:14:26.522
I'll haunt your dreams for the rest of
your life.

02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:41.601
Rashid, fuck me up!

02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:44.207
Oh fuck.

02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:02.806
Do you want something to drink,

02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:05.367
boys?

02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:15.047

Yes?

02:16:11.240 --> 02:16:13.368
Hello, I saw the advert. I'm a nanny.

02:16:13.520 --> 02:16:14.567
Come in.

02:16:17.840 --> 02:16:21.162
I don't think I'm a kid any more. There's
hair growing on my balls.

02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:24.888
Darling, you'll always be my baby boy,
even when you're a Formula One champion.

02:16:25.320 --> 02:16:27.049
