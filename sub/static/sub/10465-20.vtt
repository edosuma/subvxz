Then why was the restaurant
a bad idea?

04:19.733 --> 04:22.132
I just think it was wrong
to assume a family dinner

that would lure him in.

he knows he's in hot water

He knows dinner conversation
isn't gonna be "Pass the salt,"

voluntarily.

is figure out some way--

have a certain objectivity

10:25.267 --> 10:27.534
You think that I'm an alcoholic.

10:27.534 --> 10:28.868
Why don't you just say it?

10:28.868 --> 10:30.934
That's what you came here
to say, isn't it?

10:32.901 --> 10:34.601
I think you're an alcoholic.

10:36.501 --> 10:39.934
Well-- Well, I think
you're full of crap.

10:39.934 --> 10:42.400
I think you're all full of crap.
If you think I'm gonna hang

10:42.400 --> 10:44.567
around here and listen to you
all tell me what a lush

10:44.567 --> 10:47.133
you think I am,
as delightful as that sounds,

10:47.133 --> 10:48.868
it's been real.
If we're all wrong,

10:48.868 --> 10:50.167
then why are you running away?

10:51.801 --> 10:54.267
See, you leave now

10:54.267 --> 10:56.834
and-- And all that does
is say to us,

10:56.834 --> 10:58.734
"Bailey's got a problem,
and he's too afraid

10:58.734 --> 10:59.834
to deal with it."

10:59.834 --> 11:02.400
So-- So okay,
so I'm wrong.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.133

11:04.133 --> 11:06.000
So set us straight, Bailey.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.634
Explain it. You know, make us
see it from your side.

11:10.534 --> 11:12.801
Stay.

11:12.801 --> 11:14.901
Look, the point is not
how we got him here, okay?

11:14.901 --> 11:16.501
The point is
what's going on with him.

11:16.501 --> 11:19.200
Oh, right. Like you know
all about it, huh?

11:19.200 --> 11:21.501
Like you even have a clue
as to what goes on in his life.

11:21.501 --> 11:23.701
You know, because I don't
remember seeing any of you

11:23.701 --> 11:27.067
at the apartment, spending time,
making sure everything's okay.

11:27.067 --> 11:29.467
You know what? I don't think
we've met. Isn't that funny?

11:29.467 --> 11:32.734
Look, he pulled away from us,
okay, when he started drinking.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.567
We didn't know
what was going on.

11:34.567 --> 11:35.901
Yeah, okay. Whatever.

11:35.901 --> 11:37.834
We're trying to-- To help him.

11:37.834 --> 11:39.734
What? By lying to him?
By tricking him?

11:39.734 --> 11:42.234
You gotta be kidding me.
You think you're gonna help him?

11:42.234 --> 11:44.000
He's never gonna talk
to any of you again.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.567
Don't say that.
Look, you've seen him drink.

11:46.567 --> 11:47.834
You had to have seen him drink.

If you stay here
and tell him that, then maybe--

11:49.834 --> 11:51.934
Okay, you know what?
Just give me my keys.

This is, like,

Anyway, it's a family thing,

into some huge deal--

It's not just one time, Bailey.
One or two times, whatever.

Look, I'm not saying that
I don't drink some, okay? I do.

And occasionally,

12:59.167 --> 13:00.601
very occasionally,

13:00.601 --> 13:02.334
I have too much.

a problem or that I can't stop.

mean that I need you guys acting

Right.

Well, maybe I am.

Maybe that's the problem,

14:09.334 --> 14:12.133
that I'm on my own
