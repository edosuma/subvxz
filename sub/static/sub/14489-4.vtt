00:17.936 --> 00:20.688
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:20.772 --> 00:24.984
As the curtain rises on our
verisimilitudinous tableau,

00:25.068 --> 00:28.154
you're no doubt curious
as to why I tricked you all

00:28.238 --> 00:30.156
into hang gliding here.

00:30.240 --> 00:31.282
Close-up.

00:31.366 --> 00:35.203
It seems someone in this room
is a murderer.

00:36.079 --> 00:37.038
(BOTH GASP)

00:37.121 --> 00:40.375
It's me.
But the real question is,

00:40.458 --> 00:42.460
which of you is the victim?

00:42.710 --> 00:47.298
And that secret I
shall take to my grave.

00:47.632 --> 00:48.800
Calculon, no!

00:49.592 --> 00:50.843
(GROANING)

00:53.388 --> 00:55.557
(CALCULON CHOKING)

00:56.057 --> 00:57.392
Now, that's acting.

00:57.642 --> 01:00.979
Calculon really Shatnered
the hell out of that scene.

01:01.062 --> 01:03.356
Hey, anyone want to
go to the aquarium?

01:03.481 --> 01:05.775
They got a new
non-biting otter.

01:05.858 --> 01:07.652
Sounds great!
Non-biting otter!

01:15.410 --> 01:18.079
VVow. Aquariums have really
changed since I was a boy

01:18.162 --> 01:19.539
and no one ever
took me to them.

01:19.622 --> 01:20.623
Where's the glass?

01:20.707 --> 01:23.418
There isn't any. The water's
held in place by gravity fields

01:23.501 --> 01:25.837
so there's nothing
for kids to smear yogurt on.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.590
I like strawberry yogurt.
Can I touch the water?

01:28.673 --> 01:30.550
I wouldn't,
but I'm smart.

01:31.509 --> 01:32.510
Ahhh!

01:32.635 --> 01:33.803
Help. Police.

01:33.928 --> 01:35.138
Neat.

01:37.974 --> 01:41.519
Welcome to Jurassic Tank.

01:47.066 --> 01:49.027
Picture time.
Everybody get together.

01:49.527 --> 01:51.654
(ALL GRUMBLE)

01:51.779 --> 01:56.200
Hang on, I need a tripod. Let me
just extend the old third leg.

01:56.284 --> 01:57.285
(WHIRRING)

01:57.535 --> 02:00.913
Ooh, yeah. That's stable, baby.
Just need to pick a lens.

02:00.997 --> 02:03.374
Let's see, zoom lens?

02:03.916 --> 02:04.917
Nope.

02:05.043 --> 02:06.085
<i>They Live lens?</i>

02:07.170 --> 02:08.713
Eh... So-so.

02:08.880 --> 02:11.007

02:12.216 --> 02:15.094
Ooh, Calc:ulon's going to be here.
Better get my camera ready.

02:15.219 --> 02:16.596
Just take
the damn picture.

02:17.138 --> 02:21.225
Let me just adjust the focus,
F-stop, shutter speed.

02:21.476 --> 02:23.770
Oops! Out of film. Hang on.

02:23.853 --> 02:25.480
(ALL GRUMBLE)
Seriously.

02:25.563 --> 02:27.148
Film? Who uses film?

02:27.231 --> 02:29.275
We've had digital cameras
for a thousand years.

02:29.525 --> 02:30.985
Digital? (SPITS)

02:31.069 --> 02:34.656
No digital camera can capture the
warmth and grain of good old film.

02:34.989 --> 02:38.326
How can you even tell?
Your eyes are digital cameras.

02:38.409 --> 02:41.496
And where can you possibly get
film developed nowadays?

02:41.663 --> 02:42.997
Right here.

02:43.081 --> 02:46.626
You're looking at the last
chemical darkroom in existence.

02:46.709 --> 02:48.419
Hey,BendeL
isn't that Calculon?

02:48.503 --> 02:50.672
Calculon? No way!

02:50.755 --> 02:52.507
Oh! Oh! Oh!

02:52.799 --> 02:56.386
Yo, Calky! I'm a big fan,
and I've got a big camera.

02:56.469 --> 02:57.595
Can I get a big picture?

02:57.720 --> 02:58.721
(SIGHS)

02:58.805 --> 03:02.058
Well, I was just airbrushed
this morning, so all right.

03:02.183 --> 03:03.351
But make it snappy.

03:05.061 --> 03:06.062
That looked staged.

03:06.145 --> 03:08.272
Try one where you're pretending
to swing a tennis racquet.

03:10.566 --> 03:12.568
Okay, okay, that's enough.

03:12.652 --> 03:14.696
I'm trying to
enjoy a nice day out

03:14.821 --> 03:16.906
with the actors who
play my TV family.

03:18.950 --> 03:21.244
These rare and
fascinating deep-sea fish

03:21.369 --> 03:23.705
are extremely
sensitive to light.

03:23.955 --> 03:27.375
Over here, Calculon! Come on, smile.
Quit blinking. Red eye.

03:27.458 --> 03:28.751
Blurry. Lens cap's still on.

03:32.588 --> 03:36.134
CALCULON: Oh! We finally eluded
that obnoxious shutterbug.

03:36.217 --> 03:40.221
At last, we can enjoy our
studio-mandated quality time.

03:40.304 --> 03:42.014
(GIGGLING)

03:42.098 --> 03:44.976
Argh! I can't not
work like this.

03:45.309 --> 03:47.311
I'll be in my
day-off trailer.

03:48.980 --> 03:51.065
(BENDER SCREAMS AND BURBLES)

03:54.902 --> 03:57.697
And I took this one inside
the ichthyosaur's stomach.

03:57.780 --> 04:01.868
(LAUGHS) Man, I've never had
anyone try so hard to digest rne.

04:01.951 --> 04:04.746
Look, we've all been
in a sea monster's stomach.

04:04.829 --> 04:07.123
But did you get any pictures
of the Calculon?

04:07.248 --> 04:11.085
Yeah, but a true photo buff wouldn't
even use these for toilet paper.

04:11.169 --> 04:12.879
Not if curtains
were available.

04:12.962 --> 04:14.714
You're too hard
on yourself, robot.

04:14.881 --> 04:16.548
These pictures
are just as good

04:16.673 --> 04:18.384
as the ones in my
celebrity tabloid.

04:18.634 --> 04:20.178
<i>LEELA: Us People Magazine?</i>

04:20.261 --> 04:21.512
That's total trash.

04:21.596 --> 04:23.222
Total celebrity trash.

04:23.306 --> 04:25.558
My inquiring
organ wants to know.

04:25.641 --> 04:26.684
If you ask me,

04:26.768 --> 04:29.312
Bender should go to Us
People's office in Hollywood

04:29.437 --> 04:32.482
and see if they'd like his
Calculon pictures. (SCOFFS)

04:32.565 --> 04:34.984
I have no time for
such foolishness.

04:37.862 --> 04:40.490
Well, I changed my mind and
came to Hollywood after all.

04:40.865 --> 04:43.117
Bender, these shots
of Calculon are great.

04:43.201 --> 04:46.788
In fact, you might just have
what it takes to be a paparazzo.

04:46.871 --> 04:47.872
Namely, a camera.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.332
Shut up. I know it.

04:49.415 --> 04:51.000
Wait, a what's-a-whatzo?

04:51.083 --> 04:54.420
A paparazzo. You know, a
celebrity photographer.

04:54.504 --> 04:55.797
But it's not for everyone.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.715
You'd have to wallow
in Hollywood filth,

04:57.840 --> 05:00.635
loiter in dark alleys
behind seedy nightclubs

05:00.718 --> 05:03.137
and get spat on by
the beautiful people.

05:03.387 --> 05:05.681
Hmm, I don't know.
How much will it cost me?

05:05.765 --> 05:08.601
You misunderstand, Bender.
We'll pay you.

05:11.145 --> 05:14.899
Sir, you just hired yourself
a new what's-a-whatzo.

05:19.195 --> 05:20.822
(SLURPING)

05:20.905 --> 05:23.533

to introduce you to Bender,

05:23.616 --> 05:26.160
the newest member
of our paparazzo family.

05:26.244 --> 05:28.996
Nice to meet you. And even
though it's only my first day,

05:29.080 --> 05:31.833
I want you all to know that
I'm already better than you.

05:31.916 --> 05:34.043
Stay out of my way!

What you watching?

06:12.456 --> 06:15.793
Only a documentary about the
greatest actor in the world.

06:16.127 --> 06:17.795
Ah, yes, Calculon.

06:17.879 --> 06:19.672
Ihappenedto
snap a picture of him

06:19.797 --> 06:21.632

with his biggest fan.

06:21.716 --> 06:24.135
No, not that
scene-chewing ham.

06:24.218 --> 06:28.973
I said the greatest actor, Langdon Cobb.
Let's rewind, shall we?

06:31.350 --> 06:35.271
<i>NARRATOR: Langdon Cobb, the most
acclaimed actor of his generation.</i>

06:35.354 --> 06:36.981
Why's he wearing
a bag on his head?

06:37.064 --> 06:39.150
They're explaining
that right now.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.152
(SIGHS) Let's rewind again.

06:42.153 --> 06:44.989
<i>NARRATOR: ...most acclaimed
actor of his generation.</i>

06:45.072 --> 06:48.242
<i>He's raked in seven Academy
Awards for best actor</i>

06:48.326 --> 06:49.869
<i>and two for best actress,</i>

06:49.952 --> 06:53.289
<i>all without ever removing
his trademark bag.</i>

06:53.623 --> 06:56.959
Mr. Cobb, you're
an intensely private man.

06:57.043 --> 06:58.044
Quite right.
Mmm-hmm.

06:58.169 --> 07:00.755
And though billions of people
have seen your work... Mmm-hmm.

07:00.838 --> 07:03.049
...no one has ever
seen your face.

07:03.132 --> 07:05.509
So tell us, why the bag?

07:05.635 --> 07:09.972
Ah, yes, the bag. I've never understood
people's fascination with that.

07:10.056 --> 07:13.267
The point is, I'm
an actor and nothing more.

07:13.351 --> 07:14.852
I have no interest
in being admired

07:14.936 --> 07:17.021
for something as
inconsequenflal

07:17.146 --> 07:19.190
as my appearance
or my personal life.

07:19.273 --> 07:22.610
All that truly matters
is the process.

No, Daisy, don't!

07:37.708 --> 07:40.461

Impossible.

all for the night.

Please, sir, I implore you,
destroy that photo of me.

It's not just my privacy I've
been protecting all these years.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.477
If you show
anyone that picture,

09:19.643 --> 09:21.395
there will be
terrible consequences.

09:21.520 --> 09:24.315
The only thing terrible is
going to be my bank account.

09:24.398 --> 09:27.735
Wait. Say that again, but say,
"Tremendous consequences."

I'll pay whatever you ask.

show that photo to anyone.

honor as a paparazzo.

to see a picture?

09:39.830 --> 09:40.956
Sure.

09:45.795 --> 09:48.506
Hmm... He looked at
the photo and that happened.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.674
But it could just
be a coincidence.

09:51.008 --> 09:52.176
Yo, Amy, check it out.

09:56.472 --> 09:57.723
The evidence is mounting.

09:57.807 --> 10:00.017
Although two times
hardly establishes a pattern.

10:00.351 --> 10:01.852
I'd feel more
comfortable raising the alarm

10:02.019 --> 10:03.521
if I were
a little more certain.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.272
Hey, how'd those two
get deflated?

10:05.356 --> 10:06.524
They looked at this.

10:09.193 --> 10:10.194
(GASPS)

10:10.277 --> 10:11.278
That proves it.

10:11.362 --> 10:13.572
Looking at this
photo of Langdon Cobb

10:13.697 --> 10:15.950

Hey, Zoidberg, look at this
photo of Langdon Cobb.

10:19.245 --> 10:21.372
What, a picture
of Langdon Cobb?

10:21.455 --> 10:24.291
Now, this I want to see
as clearly as possible.

10:24.375 --> 10:26.418
Zoidberg, no!

10:26.627 --> 10:28.629
(MUTTERING ANGRILY)

10:28.712 --> 10:32.633
Oh, thank God, Professor.
You got here just in time.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.802
FARNSWORTH:
I've seen this before.

10:34.969 --> 10:37.763
Langdon Cobb must
be from Bryoria Six,

10:37.888 --> 10:40.391
home of the quantum
lichen people.

10:40.474 --> 10:42.226
Well, that explains that.

10:42.351 --> 10:46.981
They're attention parasites. They
feed on the admiration of their prey.

10:47.064 --> 10:48.691
Just like
the noble buffalo.

10:48.774 --> 10:50.234
Nothing like a buffalo.

10:50.442 --> 10:54.071
Anyone who pays attention to the
liohen is unknowingly feeding it.

10:54.155 --> 10:57.449
But gaze upon its face,
even in a photograph,

10:57.533 --> 11:02.413
and your very life force will be sucked
out, leaving you a flaccid husk.

11:02.580 --> 11:04.707
So the picture robbed
them of their souls?

11:04.874 --> 11:09.420
Souls? Don't be ridiculous. It's their
life forces that have been stolen.

11:09.503 --> 11:10.713
It's scientific.

11:10.796 --> 11:13.924
That's why the robot's immune.
He has no soul.

11:14.008 --> 11:15.176
Life force!

11:15.259 --> 11:18.304
So, how do we get
their life forces back?

11:18.387 --> 11:19.930
If we poke a hole
in Cobb's bag,

11:20.014 --> 11:23.309
will they spew out like a volcano
built on an Indian graveyard?

11:23.434 --> 11:25.519
Alas, it's not that simple.

11:25.603 --> 11:27.605
You see, just as
the Earth lichen

11:27.771 --> 11:29.773
is composed of
an algae and a fungus,

11:29.857 --> 11:34.361
the quantum variety is also
composed of two separate parts.

11:34.445 --> 11:39.825
An attractive algae-based id and
a ravenous fungus-based ego

11:39.909 --> 11:44.121
that stores the stolen souls.
I mean, life forces.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.832
Now, here's the weird part.

11:46.916 --> 11:48.709
The ego and the id
are connected

11:48.792 --> 11:52.504
not physically, like decent,
God-fearing Earth lichens,

11:52.588 --> 11:54.882
but by quantum entanglement.

11:56.133 --> 11:59.386
So the id is Langdon Cobb, but
this fungus ego could be...

11:59.470 --> 12:01.555
Anywhere!
We'll never find it.

12:01.639 --> 12:04.350
Let's just give up and
go to the aquarium again.

12:04.433 --> 12:08.062
Now, hold on. I feel like I was
chased by a mushroom reoently.

12:08.145 --> 12:10.981
Of course! The guard
dog at Cobb's estate.

12:11.065 --> 12:12.066
That's the ego.

12:12.149 --> 12:14.902
All right, let's go.
Hfllbejusthke stomping a puppy.

12:14.985 --> 12:19.198
No,no,no. Subduing an actor's
ego is no easy task.

12:19.323 --> 12:20.991
We'll have to weaken it first.

12:21.075 --> 12:23.786
Look, I own words
that are helpful.

12:23.869 --> 12:27.039
It says the World Acting Championship
is tonight in Hollywood.

12:27.122 --> 12:29.708
Quiet, Zoidberg.
God, I wish you were a husk.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.878
No, it's Langdon Cobb
versus Calculon.

12:32.962 --> 12:36.548
If we help Calculon win, it
will weaken Cobb's ego, maybe?

12:36.632 --> 12:38.634
Yes, yes, fine.

12:38.884 --> 12:41.512
(WHINING) We never go
where I want to go.

12:41.887 --> 12:46.517
So, the most galling of the
paparazzi needs my help.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.019
Lo, the worm has turned.

12:49.103 --> 12:51.689
Say cheese,
Calculon without makeup.

12:51.772 --> 12:56.277
(SIGHS) As much as I hate you,
I hate Langdon Cobb more.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.445
He beats me out
for every award,

12:58.570 --> 13:00.572
every role,
every paternity suit.

13:00.781 --> 13:05.035
Besting him at acting means
more to me than life itself.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.245
And we want to help you.

13:06.328 --> 13:08.747
Now, your only chance
is a classic death scene.

13:08.831 --> 13:11.041
One with a lot of
"thy's" and "thou's."

13:11.125 --> 13:14.628
<i>Voila'. The</i> tragic <i>end of
Rome O. and Julie T.</i>

13:14.712 --> 13:18.549
That's Romeo and <i>Juliet,</i> dummy,
by Will.i.am Shakespeare.

13:18.632 --> 13:21.677
Now, here's the poison that
Romeo uses to kill himself.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.971
Don't worry, it's just water
and food coloring.

13:24.054 --> 13:25.055
Food coloring?

13:25.139 --> 13:28.225
The most poisonous substance
known to robots?

13:28.350 --> 13:31.353
Oops! Sorry. I'll swap it out
for harmless battery acid.

13:31.437 --> 13:33.063
No. Wait.

13:33.397 --> 13:35.983
There's only one
way to ensure victory.

13:36.066 --> 13:39.403
I must perform
the ultimate death scene.

13:39.653 --> 13:44.575
I shall drink the actual
poison and actually die.

13:45.409 --> 13:47.870
But, Calculon,
you can't kill yourself.

13:48.078 --> 13:50.581
I'm a celebrity.
I can kill anyone I want.

14:03.218 --> 14:06.764
It's tragedy. Langdon Cobb will
be first to take the stage.

14:39.088 --> 14:40.172
<i>Not good.</i>

14:40.839 --> 14:43.926
The attention Cobb's receiving
is inflating his ego.

It's going totally Kanye.

14:47.638 --> 14:48.639
Wow!

When living creatures
look at Cobb's photo,
