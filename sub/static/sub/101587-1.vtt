00:31.824 --> 00:33.860
Most movies...
You ever talk about a movie

00:33.893 --> 00:36.929
with someone that happens
to have read the book?

00:36.963 --> 00:38.196
They're always so condescending.

00:38.230 --> 00:41.400
"Oh, the book was much better."

00:41.433 --> 00:44.804
"Oh, really? What I enjoyed
about the movie... no reading."

00:47.006 --> 00:48.875
I'm thinking
about getting a pet.

00:48.908 --> 00:51.209
I'mma get a dog. You know,
that's what I'mma get.

00:51.243 --> 00:54.312
I don't like cats. I don't...
Cats don't do anything.

00:54.346 --> 00:57.750
They don't... They don't have
any responsibilities.

00:57.784 --> 01:01.286
No, really, come on, you
never heard of a guard cat.

01:01.319 --> 01:03.355
Or a bomb-sniffing cat.

01:03.388 --> 01:05.457
Or a seeing-eye cat.

01:17.870 --> 01:22.541
Pop Tarts... Can there be
a simpler food item?

01:22.574 --> 01:24.576
Directions on Pop Tarts.
Like, if they weren't there,

01:24.609 --> 01:26.012
would somebody, like,
put the box down?

01:26.045 --> 01:28.681
"What? I...

01:28.715 --> 01:31.684
How do I get
that goodness in me?"

01:33.753 --> 01:37.556
I told my mother when I was
14 I wanted to be a comedian.

01:37.589 --> 01:42.461
And she said, "Oh, maybe
it's better if you just die."

01:42.494 --> 01:43.896
I like Italian delis.

01:43.930 --> 01:45.832
There's just no options.

01:45.865 --> 01:48.868
It just says sandwich.

01:48.901 --> 01:50.602
And there's a guy in there
cutting the meat.

01:50.636 --> 01:54.339
"It's going to be good."

01:56.642 --> 01:58.477
You know, when you get older,
you don't know you older

01:58.510 --> 02:00.278
because the old stuff
just happen to you.

02:00.312 --> 02:02.447
Like, you be pouring cereal
and your knee will go out.

02:02.481 --> 02:03.983
You'll go, "Oh."

02:08.821 --> 02:10.589
I was bullied
when I was a little kid.

02:10.622 --> 02:14.493
I was bullied when I was in
school for being Asian-American.

02:14.526 --> 02:17.997
The biggest problem with that
is that I am not Asian-American.

02:20.800 --> 02:21.968
I feel like I'm

02:22.001 --> 02:24.871
a reasonably intelligent
human being.

02:24.904 --> 02:28.708
And I'd say it probably
took me about six years

02:28.741 --> 02:31.576
to realize that will.i.am

02:31.610 --> 02:36.381
was just William
with dots in it.

02:36.414 --> 02:38.017
Anyone else have that same...

02:38.050 --> 02:41.788
I feel like half of you right
now are like, "Oh, my God.

02:41.821 --> 02:43.956
It's William with dots in it."

02:43.990 --> 02:46.926
It's the little things we miss.

02:54.366 --> 02:55.467
Emcee: Alright, guys,
we're gonna

02:55.500 --> 02:57.069
keep the comedy rolling here.

02:57.103 --> 02:59.071
But just reminder,
we got 25-cent wings

02:59.105 --> 03:00.873
for the next 30 minutes

03:00.907 --> 03:02.909
and beer buckets till 10:00.

03:02.942 --> 03:06.344
Next up is one of my favorites
here at the open mic.

03:06.378 --> 03:10.448
Put your hands together
for Will Chu.

03:11.951 --> 03:13.719
Every time I go
to a Chinese restaurant,

03:13.753 --> 03:15.121
this is what
all of my friends do to me.

03:15.154 --> 03:18.623
They're like, "Will, Will,
order in Mandarin.

03:18.658 --> 03:20.126
It's gonna sound hilarious.

03:20.159 --> 03:22.427
Order in Mandarin, bro.
They got to hook it up."

03:22.460 --> 03:24.931
I'm like, "Bro,
we're in Panda Express.

03:24.964 --> 03:27.432
Her name tag says
Consuela on it.

03:27.465 --> 03:29.669
I don't think
that's a Mandarin name.

03:29.702 --> 03:32.370
Like, what do you expect,
if I order in Mandarin

03:32.404 --> 03:34.640
some ninja's going to pop up
from behind the kitchens

03:34.674 --> 03:37.609
just like, 'Poof, here's your
Kung Pao panda penis'"?

03:37.643 --> 03:38.978
You know?

03:39.011 --> 03:40.713
I took this tall girl
to a concert, right?

03:40.746 --> 03:42.982
I couldn't see anything,
so I was miserable.

03:43.015 --> 03:44.784
I couldn't see anything.

03:44.817 --> 03:47.053
So I just looked up at her.
I'm like, "Hey, pick me up."

03:50.790 --> 03:54.660
People are using their phone for
everything except as a phone.

03:54.694 --> 03:56.394
You have to text now.

03:56.428 --> 04:01.100
I was okay with emojis
because it used to be yellow.

04:01.133 --> 04:03.401
And I was pretty okay with that.

04:03.435 --> 04:05.671
It should just stay that way.

04:05.705 --> 04:07.874
Now they have like five shades
of different colors, right?

04:07.907 --> 04:09.541
It's confusing.

04:09.574 --> 04:11.711
I was trying to text
my black friend a thumbs up.

04:11.744 --> 04:13.612
I wasn't sure if I should
text him my thumbs up

04:13.646 --> 04:14.747
or his thumbs up.

04:14.780 --> 04:16.615
I never texted him back.

04:16.649 --> 04:18.918
Thank you, guys, that's my time.
I'm Will Chu.

04:21.821 --> 04:24.456
Keep it going. Yeah.

04:24.489 --> 04:26.125
Good job.

04:26.158 --> 04:28.160
Thank you for waiting it out.

04:28.194 --> 04:29.862
I got some jokes for you.

04:29.896 --> 04:32.999
You ever notice how long
a giraffe's neck is?

04:33.032 --> 04:37.203
- Yeah?
- Giraffe scarfs.

04:37.236 --> 04:39.972
Sore throats. You use that.
It's cute.

04:40.006 --> 04:42.108
I'll... I'll try it out.

04:42.141 --> 04:44.476
Oh, God, I'm full.

04:44.509 --> 04:46.712
Thanks for coming.

04:46.746 --> 04:48.147
- Hey, Quinn.
- Dude.

04:48.180 --> 04:49.715
Dude, love your bringer.

04:49.749 --> 04:51.183
What retirement home
did you get him from?

04:51.217 --> 04:53.551
It's gotten so bad
I have to invite my neighbors.

04:53.585 --> 04:56.621
I'm so sick of asking people
to pay to come watch me.

04:56.656 --> 04:58.658
I wish I was
doing "The Tonight Show,"

04:58.691 --> 05:00.760
but you gotta keep working
to take a bigger shot.

05:00.793 --> 05:03.162
- And here we are.
- Emcee: Show him some love.

05:03.195 --> 05:04.897
Watch me destroy.

05:07.934 --> 05:10.169
What's up, what's up, what's up?
Make some noise.

05:10.202 --> 05:12.238
Keep it going for Will.

05:12.271 --> 05:14.240
Your bringer didn't pay his tab.

05:14.273 --> 05:15.741
Are you serious?

05:15.775 --> 05:18.110
Yeah.
And don't run the light again.

05:18.144 --> 05:19.611
...Asian doctor.

05:19.645 --> 05:21.247
I've never seen an Asian vet.

05:26.252 --> 05:27.687
How was school?

05:27.720 --> 05:29.789
Getting them
to dissect frogs was fun.

05:29.822 --> 05:32.457
Getting them to wash
their hands was not.

05:39.632 --> 05:42.234
Yo, that's my ranch, right?

05:42.268 --> 05:44.136
Yes.

05:44.170 --> 05:48.007
They asked if you wanted a side
of ranch and you said no, right?

05:48.040 --> 05:49.141
Yes.

05:49.175 --> 05:52.745
Then why are you using my ranch?

05:52.778 --> 05:54.914
I knew you would get a side
of ranch so I didn't have to.

05:54.947 --> 05:57.950
You are frugal.
Like a old Chinese woman.

05:59.919 --> 06:01.954
Speaking of which,
I ordered us

06:01.988 --> 06:04.690
the 42-ounce bag of
Cool Ranch Doritos.

06:04.724 --> 06:06.926
Why didn't you just buy
four 10-ounce bags?

06:06.959 --> 06:09.028
- How is that a fun Instagram?
- Doing it for the Gram.

06:09.061 --> 06:12.298
Mm-hmm.

06:12.331 --> 06:17.069
Hey, I just want to say
I really enjoy my time with you.

06:17.103 --> 06:18.671
You make me laugh.

06:18.704 --> 06:21.073
It's nice to know
we're moving forward together.

06:21.107 --> 06:23.275
I agree.

06:26.312 --> 06:28.647
Not only are you gorgeous,

06:28.681 --> 06:31.017
but I love that you eat
like an eighth grader.

06:40.760 --> 06:42.294
- Comedy Cellar.
- Hi. I'm calling

06:42.328 --> 06:44.562
in regards to auditioning
to becoming a regular.

06:44.596 --> 06:45.931
You have to have
two recommendations

06:45.965 --> 06:47.700
from two existing regulars.
Who are they?

06:47.733 --> 06:49.135
- Two existing?
- Look, I got to go.

06:49.168 --> 06:51.704
Hello? Hello?

06:51.737 --> 06:54.774
Hey, Gary, can I borrow a pen?

06:58.177 --> 07:01.347
Boom. What's going on
with that windshield claim?

07:01.380 --> 07:02.748
I was trying to wrap it up.

07:02.782 --> 07:04.350
Wrong.

07:04.383 --> 07:07.887
Do or do not.
There is no...

07:07.920 --> 07:11.257
- T-There is no...?
- There is no try.

07:11.290 --> 07:14.727
Try. Yoda.
"Empire Strikes Back."

07:14.760 --> 07:16.762
Looking good there, Gary.

07:18.931 --> 07:22.301
Yeah. Getting dirty today.
I love it.

07:22.334 --> 07:24.303
I just got a six-car pileup
in from Indy.

07:24.336 --> 07:26.939
It's a mess. It's a mess.
So that's been expedited,

07:26.972 --> 07:28.808
which means you're
getting it expedited.

07:28.841 --> 07:31.811
So I'm going to need
these folders ASAP.

07:31.844 --> 07:34.180
Oh, and, Will, remember
I want all this stuff

07:34.213 --> 07:36.816
in Times New Roman at 14 point.

07:48.694 --> 07:51.197
I'm trying to get
my set ready to audition.

07:51.230 --> 07:54.300
- Right. So, what's your plan?
- I don't know.

07:54.333 --> 07:56.368
It's hard to get stage time
with no credits.

07:56.402 --> 07:58.838
I've been looking for options
other than Mickey's.

07:58.871 --> 08:00.206
There just hasn't
been anything.

08:06.979 --> 08:08.647
Sorry, Quinn is texting me.

08:08.681 --> 08:10.716
He's at the open mic
and he said it's packed.

08:10.749 --> 08:13.419
It's packed?
You should go.

08:13.452 --> 08:15.955
Here you go. Thanks.

08:15.988 --> 08:20.893
Oh, great choice.
This is my favorite bear.

08:20.926 --> 08:23.095
It's nice to see
someone happy at work.

08:23.129 --> 08:25.865
You know, when I think about
my job, the only silver lining

08:25.898 --> 08:29.101
is I can't possibly
hang myself in the cubicle.

08:29.135 --> 08:30.970
- Not funny.
- Well, I thought about it.

08:31.003 --> 08:33.038
With three walls,
you actually can't.

08:33.072 --> 08:34.940
- Hey.
- Okay, but all I'm saying

08:34.974 --> 08:37.276
is I don't think my mother and
father came here and sacrificed

08:37.309 --> 08:40.246
so I can end up shorting
people on insurance claims.

08:40.279 --> 08:41.947
I want to be a working comic.

08:41.981 --> 08:44.383
Basically I look at the road
ahead of me right now

08:44.416 --> 08:45.951
and it's in a cubicle
selling things

08:45.985 --> 08:47.253
I don't believe in.

08:47.286 --> 08:48.787
I'd rather see my name
on the marquee,

08:48.821 --> 08:50.923
something I can get
excited about.

08:50.956 --> 08:54.026
And enjoy, you know?
Something I'm proud of.

08:54.059 --> 08:56.962
Oh, for an additional $6,
you can get this put in.

08:56.996 --> 08:59.265
$6? Does it have Bluetooth?

09:02.868 --> 09:05.070
I tell you, my girlfriend
caught me the other day.

09:05.104 --> 09:07.473
Caught me the other... just,
you know what, it's just...

09:07.506 --> 09:09.441
She just caught me.
I'm secure about it.

09:09.475 --> 09:13.779
You just gotta keep your cool.
Just do this, alright?

09:13.812 --> 09:15.915
"You're next, bitch.

09:15.948 --> 09:17.850
You like that? You like that?"

09:17.883 --> 09:19.084
Yes, and ladies,
I know it's small.

09:19.118 --> 09:20.853
Joey. Joey.

09:20.886 --> 09:23.222
But it's how the pencil
writes, bitch, alright?

09:23.255 --> 09:26.091
Mine can write in cursive,
alright? Calligraphy.

09:26.125 --> 09:29.395
Hey. Thank you. So, Quinn wrote
my name down earlier.

09:29.428 --> 09:30.829
When can I get on?

09:30.863 --> 09:33.299
Well, I'm not
making any promises.

09:33.332 --> 09:37.770
Sometimes I think maybe you
light me just a little early.

09:37.803 --> 09:39.838
Well, that's when
it's not going well.

09:39.872 --> 09:41.307
That's how you can tell that.

09:41.340 --> 09:43.042
You're going to get
a light at two minutes,

09:43.075 --> 09:44.376
and then you're going
to get another light.

09:44.410 --> 09:46.812
And the second light
means get off the stage.

09:46.845 --> 09:48.113
Can I go up soon?

09:48.147 --> 09:50.115
Keep it going for Quinn, y'all.

09:50.149 --> 09:51.750
Good set, Quinn.

09:51.784 --> 09:53.018
-Hey, thanks, pal.

09:53.052 --> 09:56.222
Hey.
Oh, that was so good.

09:56.255 --> 09:58.390
Aren't you just
the cutest little thing?

09:58.424 --> 10:03.996
Oh, well, this cute little thing
is a big bad boy.

10:04.029 --> 10:07.166
With needs that are adult
like a careless whisper

10:07.199 --> 10:09.001
- and some booze.
- Okay.

10:09.034 --> 10:12.204
Do you boys want to come join us
for '80s night at the Tavern?

10:12.238 --> 10:15.074
Oh, want to? Yeah.
Dude, we'd love to.

10:15.107 --> 10:17.476
No, no, I got to
hang out until my set.

10:17.509 --> 10:19.044
- But thanks.
- Aww.

10:19.078 --> 10:21.480
What a card. Swipe left.

10:21.513 --> 10:25.251
Well, nice meeting you.
Let's go sit.

10:25.284 --> 10:27.219
Are you fucking kidding me?

10:27.253 --> 10:28.354
Look at these two.

10:28.387 --> 10:31.957
Quinn, I got a girlfriend.

10:31.991 --> 10:35.394
Full disclosure,
I can't close without you, okay?

10:35.427 --> 10:38.197
It's like wherever Laverne goes,
Shirley follows.

10:38.230 --> 10:39.498
Dude, I need you.

10:39.531 --> 10:41.800
Okay, okay,
I see where this is going.

10:41.834 --> 10:43.836
Why don't you just get one of
the Joeys to be your wingman?

10:43.869 --> 10:46.238
Go fuck yourself. No, dude,
those fucking jabronis?

10:46.272 --> 10:47.573
Look at that guy.

10:47.606 --> 10:49.041
Dude, dude, neither
of them have money,

10:49.074 --> 10:50.409
and I'll end up paying
for their drinks.

10:50.442 --> 10:52.177
Plus I'm pretty sure
they do a lot of coke,

10:52.211 --> 10:53.512
which I can't afford.

10:53.545 --> 10:56.015
So please hang out
with me for one beer.

10:56.048 --> 10:59.518
- Joey.
- Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you.

10:59.551 --> 11:01.120
- Hey Quinn.
- Hey, dawg.

11:01.153 --> 11:03.022
Hey. Spot me a brewski?

11:03.055 --> 11:05.491
- Yeah, sure, dawg. Sure.
- Oh, hey.

11:05.524 --> 11:07.559
You girls like blow?

11:07.593 --> 11:13.299
Would you rather drink
a bucket of human feces or not?

11:13.332 --> 11:15.334
Which one would you choose?

11:15.367 --> 11:17.403
Hey, Mickey, what time is my...

11:17.436 --> 11:19.071
- Hey, Joey?
- Hey, what's up, Joey?

11:19.104 --> 11:21.273
Hey, a Jew and an Italian
go into business together.

11:21.307 --> 11:23.242
- Uh-oh.
- Who loses?

11:23.275 --> 11:24.343
I don't know. Who?

11:24.376 --> 11:26.145
- The government.
- Oh, come on.

11:26.178 --> 11:27.913
Hey, Mick, so when can I get on?

11:27.946 --> 11:29.515
I'm looking at this right now,

11:29.548 --> 11:31.884
and I don't see that anybody
gave your name at the door.

11:31.917 --> 11:35.154
You know the deal.
Two paying customers to see you,

11:35.187 --> 11:37.022
and then you get
to do five minutes.

11:37.056 --> 11:39.124
Mickey, I'm running
out of friends.

11:39.158 --> 11:40.926
Not my problem.

11:40.959 --> 11:41.927
I'll bring four people next week

11:41.960 --> 11:43.630
if you just give me
a few minutes on stage.

11:43.663 --> 11:45.264
Will, if I make
an exception for you,

11:45.297 --> 11:47.333
then I have to make an exception
for everybody else

11:47.366 --> 11:49.368
that wanders in and goes,
"I don't have any friends.

11:49.401 --> 11:52.037
- I don't have any friends."
- Mickey, Mickey, I promise.

11:52.071 --> 11:54.173
Four people. Please.

11:54.206 --> 11:56.075
To you, this is a show.

11:56.108 --> 11:58.277
To me, this is a business.

11:58.310 --> 11:59.646
Please?

11:59.679 --> 12:01.180
No.

12:05.685 --> 12:07.086
You guys ready to rock?

12:12.257 --> 12:14.960
This microphone needs Viagra.
What?

12:18.297 --> 12:19.498
What clubs have you played?

12:19.531 --> 12:21.066
Just open mics.

12:21.100 --> 12:22.901
You don't have any credits,
I can't book you.

12:22.935 --> 12:24.903
I can't get credits
if I can't get up.

12:59.138 --> 13:00.406
Jose.

13:00.439 --> 13:02.975
Can you turn down
the music, please?

13:09.248 --> 13:10.449
Rockview Insurance,
may I help you?

13:10.482 --> 13:13.686
No, I understand.

13:13.720 --> 13:15.454
Yes, Mr. Kominsky.

13:15.487 --> 13:17.222
Did you get me these pens?

13:20.292 --> 13:22.561
We have all
the information we need.

13:22.594 --> 13:24.530
Okay, you want to talk
to a supervisor?

13:24.563 --> 13:26.231
Yeah, that's not a problem.

13:32.538 --> 13:36.341
I never win.

13:50.189 --> 13:52.624
Don't stop.

13:52.659 --> 13:54.293
Don't stop?

13:54.326 --> 13:55.628
Believing.

13:55.662 --> 13:59.331
Hanford, California,
Steven Perry... Journey.

14:02.201 --> 14:04.303
Round two of the sushi. Ciao.

14:11.076 --> 14:19.686
Yo, fuck faaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...
wait for it... aace.

14:19.719 --> 14:21.654
Well, number one,
go fuck yourself.

14:21.688 --> 14:23.589
The Joeys ruined everything,

14:23.622 --> 14:27.159
and now they owe me 85 bucks
I'll never see again.

14:27.192 --> 14:31.029
I am headed up to Detroit
to open up for Steven Gold.

14:31.063 --> 14:33.633
So that means I can't emcee
the Pennsylvania Improv

14:33.666 --> 14:35.133
from tonight through Sunday.

14:35.167 --> 14:36.468
So the manager asked me

14:36.502 --> 14:39.071
if I could recommend
a comic last minute.

14:39.104 --> 14:42.709
- I said you. He said great.
- Oh, wow.

14:42.742 --> 14:46.713
This is a major opportunity,
alright? If you kill it...

14:46.746 --> 14:48.648
Well, I got all these claims
that I got to file.

14:48.681 --> 14:51.283
Chip Fontaine is a made man.

14:51.316 --> 14:53.218
He's the manager, and he books

14:53.252 --> 14:55.187
not only
the Pennsylvania Improv,

14:55.220 --> 14:56.622
but 12 more clubs.

14:56.656 --> 14:59.224
He's also a chatty Kathy,
and word will get out

14:59.258 --> 15:00.793
to all the other clubs.

15:00.827 --> 15:03.095
It's just like figure skating.
It's a small world.

15:03.128 --> 15:04.563
Figure skating?

15:04.596 --> 15:06.465
Hey, you got your
childhood, I got mine, okay?

15:06.498 --> 15:08.400
Dude, if Chip likes you,

15:08.433 --> 15:09.769
you're in the rotation
and you go full-time.

15:09.802 --> 15:11.638
You take this weekend
and you get started,

15:11.671 --> 15:13.238
you're on your way, man.

15:13.272 --> 15:15.507
- I just don't know if I'm ready.
- Oh, I get it.

15:15.541 --> 15:20.680
No, you are horribly scared and
terrified and you fear failure.

15:20.713 --> 15:22.849
I-I get it. I get it.

15:22.882 --> 15:24.684
I'm not scared.
I said I'm not ready.

15:24.717 --> 15:26.385
There's a big difference. Okay?

15:26.418 --> 15:28.387
I don't wanna just take
this opportunity and bomb.

15:28.420 --> 15:30.790
I was scared too, but ever
since I took the big leap,

15:30.823 --> 15:33.292
even on my worst fucking day,
I thank God

15:33.325 --> 15:36.261
I'm not selling anybody
a 2012 Kia Sorento.

15:36.295 --> 15:39.264
Chances like this
don't happen every day.

15:39.298 --> 15:40.800
If you don't take this shot,

15:40.833 --> 15:42.669
dude, you might as well
quit stand-up

15:42.702 --> 15:45.103
and, like,
remain in your cubicle

15:45.137 --> 15:47.606
and your living
Geico commercial.

15:47.640 --> 15:49.207
And, well, I didn't
tell you the best part.

15:49.241 --> 15:50.677
You'll never guess
who's headlining.

15:50.710 --> 15:55.414
He's literally your favorite
TV star of all time.

15:55.447 --> 15:56.816
<i>There's one
meaningful question.</i>

15:56.849 --> 15:58.383
<i>Have you reached
your full potential?</i>

15:58.417 --> 15:59.819
<i>Don't... Don't think about it.</i>

15:59.852 --> 16:01.453
<i>Don't think about
what the answer is,</i>

16:01.486 --> 16:02.822
<i>I'll tell you the answer.
The answer is...</i>

16:02.855 --> 16:04.456
Here are a pile of claims
from the six-car pileup.

16:04.489 --> 16:08.260
Hey, my ace in the hole.
I love it, I love it.

16:08.293 --> 16:10.162
Look, Barry, I got the work done

16:10.195 --> 16:12.598
so I would like
to take tomorrow off.

16:13.700 --> 16:15.902
Will.

16:15.935 --> 16:18.270
Will, Will, Will, Will, Will.

16:18.303 --> 16:20.472
When you reach the end
of your rope, you...

16:21.674 --> 16:24.209
Uh, what are you talking about?

16:24.242 --> 16:27.914
When you reach
the end of your rope, you...?

16:27.947 --> 16:30.883
- You get more rope?
- Wrong.

16:30.917 --> 16:32.351
When you reach the end
of your rope,

16:32.384 --> 16:34.721
you tie it in a knot
and you hang on.

16:34.754 --> 16:36.188
It's Thomas Jefferson.

16:36.221 --> 16:37.522
You should know that.

16:37.556 --> 16:39.792
I need to take tomorrow off.

16:39.826 --> 16:44.797
In our world, as you know,
there are accidents.

16:44.831 --> 16:46.699
We don't control them,

16:46.733 --> 16:49.702
but we can control
what we do about them.

16:51.838 --> 16:54.741
I'm not asking you, Barry.
I'm taking tomorrow off.

16:54.774 --> 16:56.475
It's very important to me.

16:56.508 --> 16:59.746
Will, what's important to you
is keeping your job.

16:59.779 --> 17:03.650
So let's turn the beat around,
see you show up tomorrow

17:03.683 --> 17:05.217
with a little more passion
on your face,

17:05.250 --> 17:06.551
and knock out
some of those claims.

17:06.585 --> 17:08.620
Capiche?

17:08.655 --> 17:09.922
I won't be back tomorrow.

17:12.659 --> 17:14.326
I'm done. I quit.

17:14.359 --> 17:15.895
Wrong.

17:15.928 --> 17:17.562
I can't do that anymore, okay?

17:17.596 --> 17:19.498
Seriously, it's over.

17:19.531 --> 17:21.701
I'm done. I quit.

17:21.734 --> 17:25.203
Hey, if you think I'm giving you
a good recommendation,

17:25.237 --> 17:26.471
you're crazy.

17:27.740 --> 17:28.875
Hey, cupcake.

17:28.908 --> 17:30.375
I'm 100% in.

17:30.409 --> 17:32.277
- In for what?
- The gig this weekend.

17:32.310 --> 17:33.646
Oh, my God. Sorry, dude.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.815
I... You made it sound
like you weren't coming.

17:35.848 --> 17:37.516
You gotta be kidding me, right?

17:37.549 --> 17:38.918
I wish you had called
even just five minutes ago.

17:38.951 --> 17:41.821
I literally just
booked the Joeys.

17:41.854 --> 17:45.323
Oh, my God. I'm getting
physically sick to my stomach.

17:47.325 --> 17:49.261
This is going to
absolutely cripple me.

17:49.294 --> 17:51.931
Quinn, do... do you know
what I just did here?

17:51.964 --> 17:56.703
Dude, I'm sorry.
I can't do this to you, man.

17:56.736 --> 17:58.503
Oh, my God.

17:58.537 --> 18:00.405
You think I'd book
the fucking Joeys?

18:00.439 --> 18:01.741
Dude, I was just about
to call you.

18:01.774 --> 18:03.241
Congrats.

18:03.275 --> 18:06.411
You're an asshole, Quinn.

18:06.445 --> 18:09.514
Yeah, an asshole who got you
a fucking sweet gig.

18:16.856 --> 18:18.958
Look, I'll be in contact
with the Pennsylvania Club.

18:18.991 --> 18:21.828
They'll put you up
at the condo.

18:21.861 --> 18:24.296
Show time today.
You better get moving.

18:24.329 --> 18:26.298
You are making
the right call, buddy.

18:31.738 --> 18:35.474
Billy G? At an improv?
That's a big deal.

18:35.507 --> 18:37.844
That's pretty good.

18:37.877 --> 18:39.311
Knock them dead.
Kill them.

18:39.344 --> 18:40.913
Is that what you say?
Break a leg.

18:43.082 --> 18:45.685
Big fan. Huge fan.

18:45.718 --> 18:47.887
Nice to meet you, Mr. G.

18:47.920 --> 18:52.859
Hi, I'm Will Chu.
I'm your opening act.

18:57.529 --> 18:58.965
Oh, Billy.

18:58.998 --> 19:01.266
Oh, my God,
it's so good to be here.

19:03.568 --> 19:05.805
I've been waiting all my life
for this moment.

19:12.511 --> 19:15.280
What's up, Pennsylvania Improv?

20:04.964 --> 20:09.802
Hi. I'm Will. Will Chu.
I'm the emcee.

20:09.836 --> 20:13.471
Actually, since we're talking
names, my name is spelt C-H-U.

20:13.505 --> 20:16.709
Ah, so you asking me
to run up on the ladder

20:16.742 --> 20:18.811
and change your name?

20:18.845 --> 20:21.080
Wondering, um, can I get
the keys to the condo?

20:21.113 --> 20:23.149
Is the manager around?

20:23.182 --> 20:26.953
TT to Charlie Money.

20:26.986 --> 20:29.387
Yeah, Chip will be here
in just a minute.

20:29.421 --> 20:32.825
Well, this is my house.
I protect my house.

20:34.927 --> 20:36.863
Oh, hey.

20:36.896 --> 20:38.496
Must be Will. Chip.

20:38.530 --> 20:40.432
Nice to meet you.
Thanks for having me.

20:40.465 --> 20:42.034
You can recommended,

20:42.068 --> 20:43.903
so if you want to make this
more than a one-time thing,

20:43.936 --> 20:46.005
I'm going to need you
to keep the crowd on track,

20:46.038 --> 20:47.539
handle the hecklers,

20:47.572 --> 20:50.475
and most importantly
make the audience laugh.

20:50.508 --> 20:52.845
- Yeah.
- Big laughs, okay?

20:52.879 --> 20:56.716
Got it. And thank you.
I appreciate this weekend.

20:56.749 --> 20:58.550
Y-You don't know
what it means to me.

21:04.556 --> 21:06.192
By the way, you're going to be
sharing the condo this weekend

21:06.225 --> 21:07.727
with our feature, Chris Palmer.

21:07.760 --> 21:09.862
- Awesome.
- Well, you say that now.

21:09.896 --> 21:11.130
Let's see how you feel
on Sunday.

21:11.163 --> 21:12.798
Why is that?

21:12.832 --> 21:15.668
Look, Will, Chris is going
to show you things

21:15.701 --> 21:17.703
that you can't unsee.

21:17.737 --> 21:19.171
And when he does,
I want you to call me.

21:19.205 --> 21:22.174
I'm going to give you my number.

21:22.208 --> 21:24.810
If you need help
or a shoulder to cry on,

21:24.844 --> 21:26.544
or even a place to stay,

21:26.578 --> 21:29.447
because Chris can get
a little rowdy,

21:29.481 --> 21:31.516
I want you to reach out.

21:31.549 --> 21:33.085
Sure.

21:33.119 --> 21:35.888
Here. What's your number?

21:35.922 --> 21:39.025
No, I'll put it in. Here.

21:39.058 --> 21:41.661
That was easy, huh?

21:41.694 --> 21:42.929
Call me.

21:42.962 --> 21:44.797
Call me right now
so I have your number.

21:44.830 --> 21:46.832
Oh. Yeah.

21:46.866 --> 21:49.434
Great. I'm vibrating.

21:54.506 --> 21:55.908
Must be you.

21:55.942 --> 21:58.177
Cool.

21:58.210 --> 22:00.079
So it begins.

22:08.988 --> 22:10.923
Hello?

22:10.957 --> 22:12.658
Hello?

22:12.692 --> 22:16.662
Whoa. Don't you fucking knock?

22:16.696 --> 22:18.764
What kind of a dickhole
barges in somewhere

22:18.798 --> 22:20.666
like he owns the place, huh?

22:20.700 --> 22:21.701
Huh?

22:21.734 --> 22:23.836
I'm... fucking with you.

22:23.869 --> 22:25.271
What's up, man? You Will?

22:25.304 --> 22:26.772
Chris. How are you, bro?

22:26.806 --> 22:27.974
- Great to meet you.
- Good, man.

22:28.007 --> 22:29.675
We're going to have
a great weekend.

22:29.709 --> 22:30.876
Your first time here?

22:30.910 --> 22:33.679
First time in any real club.

22:33.713 --> 22:34.780
So I'm just
a little bit nervous.

22:34.814 --> 22:36.082
Oh, no, no, no, no. Why?

22:36.115 --> 22:38.284
Did Chip start
flirting with you?

22:38.317 --> 22:39.885
Oh, was that what it was?

22:39.919 --> 22:41.619
Yeah, yeah, just don't
give him your number.

22:41.654 --> 22:43.856
You'll be fine.

22:46.892 --> 22:48.526
And over there's the hot tub.

22:48.560 --> 22:49.895
Just fucking around,
there's no hot tub.

22:49.929 --> 22:51.697
Anyway, this is the condo.

22:51.731 --> 22:53.833
I took this bedroom, so the
other one's yours, alright?

22:53.866 --> 22:55.868
Awesome.
I'm gonna take a shower.

22:55.901 --> 22:57.303
You want to head
to the club after that?

22:57.336 --> 23:00.072
Fuck yeah, Will.
Fuck yes, I do.

23:03.642 --> 23:05.845
Hey, yo, don't use
that shampoo by the way.

23:05.878 --> 23:07.279
Sometimes dudes jizz in it

23:07.313 --> 23:09.682
just to fuck with guys
for the following week.

23:09.715 --> 23:11.250
- You serious?
- Yeah.

23:11.283 --> 23:13.652
Hey, you ever been
to the Warhol Museum?

23:13.686 --> 23:15.087
I've always wanted
to check it out.

23:15.121 --> 23:16.155
Want to go tomorrow?

23:16.188 --> 23:17.289
Yeah, sure.

23:17.323 --> 23:18.590
Fuck yeah.

23:18.623 --> 23:19.925
Dibs first shower.

23:37.243 --> 23:38.844
Welcome to
the world-famous

23:38.878 --> 23:40.346
Improv Thursday night.

23:40.379 --> 23:42.181
Make some noise.

23:42.214 --> 23:46.252
Who's ready for
a great show tonight?

23:46.285 --> 23:49.288
Okay, just a reminder to keep
your talking to a minimum

23:49.321 --> 23:51.690
and your laughter
to a maximum.

23:51.724 --> 23:53.292
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll be starting the show

23:53.325 --> 23:55.194
in just a few minutes.

23:55.227 --> 23:58.197
- Ooh, long time, Rachel. Hello.
- Just letting you know

23:58.230 --> 24:00.733
we'd like you to turn
your cellphones to silent.

24:00.766 --> 24:03.769
There's no video or flash
photography during the show.

24:03.803 --> 24:06.238
Be sure to sign up
for our e-mail list.

24:06.272 --> 24:08.240
The cards are on your tables.

24:15.314 --> 24:17.249
You okay, bro?

24:17.283 --> 24:20.186
Oh, yeah, yeah. I just...
just a little nervous.

24:20.219 --> 24:21.754
That is like
the biggest audience

24:21.787 --> 24:23.722
- I've ever performed for.
- Dude, don't be nervous.

24:23.756 --> 24:25.658
Fuck those people out there.
Just do you.

24:25.691 --> 24:27.159
- Chris.
- Holy shit.

24:27.193 --> 24:29.161
I heard Chris.
How you doing, man?

24:29.195 --> 24:30.963
- I'm good.
- I'm still kind of hungover

24:30.996 --> 24:32.665
from the last time
we chilled out.

24:32.698 --> 24:34.166
Oh, yeah, Ricky that's called
a bender, my friend.

24:34.200 --> 24:35.768
Probably right.

24:35.801 --> 24:38.971
Yo, you still fucking
with that cheerleader?

24:39.004 --> 24:41.874
The blonde one with
the half-shaved head?

24:43.976 --> 24:45.678
God bless you, Chris.

24:45.711 --> 24:47.213
What up, man? I'm Ricky.

24:47.246 --> 24:48.247
I'm Will. I'm the emcee.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.382
I'm the sound guy, man. Cool.

24:50.416 --> 24:53.085
Alright, what kind of
intro music you guys want?

24:53.119 --> 24:55.321
- Surprise me, bud.
- What about you?

24:55.354 --> 24:56.989
Something by the Killers?

24:57.022 --> 24:59.291
Alright, cool. You know,
Chip loves the Killers, man.

24:59.325 --> 25:02.261
You know what?
Why don't you pick something?

25:02.294 --> 25:04.196
- Anything but the Killers.
- You sure?

25:04.230 --> 25:08.434
- Yeah. Absolutely.
- Alright. Cool.

25:08.467 --> 25:10.269
What do you want for your intro?

25:10.302 --> 25:12.738
You can say clubs and colleges.

25:12.771 --> 25:15.307
What clubs?

25:15.341 --> 25:16.809
Uh, what colleges?

25:16.842 --> 25:19.078
Um...

25:19.111 --> 25:21.780
So I'll just keep it plain and
simple, just clubs and colleges.

25:21.814 --> 25:23.415
Gonna keep it broad, you know.
Sounds good.

25:23.449 --> 25:25.851
Alright, listen, guys,
Will, you're doing 12,

25:25.885 --> 25:27.319
Chris, you're doing 25.

25:27.353 --> 25:29.021
You get a two-minute light each,

25:29.054 --> 25:31.390
and it's a big red light
right at the back of the wall.

25:31.423 --> 25:33.092
You can't miss it, alright?

25:33.125 --> 25:34.293
Is it that wall?

25:34.326 --> 25:35.828
Have a good show, y'all. Peace.

25:35.861 --> 25:39.098
- Love you, buddy.
- Love you too, nigga.

25:39.131 --> 25:41.767
- Did he just call you... nigga?
- I love it.

25:44.003 --> 25:45.204
What do you want for your intro?

25:45.237 --> 25:47.406
Oh, same just clubs
and colleges.

25:47.439 --> 25:49.875
Which clubs and colleges
have you done?

25:49.909 --> 25:53.712
Oh, let's see, I've done like
28 improvs, Funny Bones,

25:53.746 --> 25:55.414
and I did...
I did the NACA Conference.

25:55.447 --> 25:58.884
That's like 30 colleges
last year.

25:58.918 --> 26:01.720
- Good... Good for you.
- Thank you very much.

26:01.754 --> 26:04.490
Thursday night,
make some noise.

26:06.425 --> 26:09.295
Alright, buddy, here we go.

26:09.328 --> 26:11.463
Give it for your
headliner this evening, Billy G.

26:11.497 --> 26:15.334
- To a great show.
- To a great show.

26:15.367 --> 26:19.071
And your future act,
Chris Palmer.

26:19.104 --> 26:20.739
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

26:20.773 --> 26:23.042
please give
a Pennsylvania Improv welcome

26:23.075 --> 26:24.977
to your host
and emcee for the evening.

26:25.010 --> 26:27.880
You know your opening act
from clubs and colleges,

26:27.913 --> 26:31.317
please welcome Will Chu.

26:37.089 --> 26:40.326
What's up, Pennsylvania?
How you guys doing?

26:40.359 --> 26:44.163
Alright.
Awesome, awesome crowd tonight.

26:44.196 --> 26:46.065
Is everybody here
from Pennsylvania?

26:46.098 --> 26:48.334
Awesome.

26:48.367 --> 26:51.036
Lot of pretty girls
from Pennsylvania, am I right?

26:51.070 --> 26:53.205
Yeah, not... not here
but in downtown, you know.

26:55.975 --> 26:58.544
You know, dating... dating
is totally different now, right?

26:58.577 --> 27:00.980
Like, I know...
I know where I stand.

27:01.013 --> 27:05.551
Like, I am... I'm, like, cute.
I'm not like the macho guy.

27:05.584 --> 27:07.353
You know, I wish
I could be that guy.

27:07.386 --> 27:09.355
Like, I'm really good looking...

27:09.388 --> 27:12.224
if you're into anime.

27:12.258 --> 27:16.095
That's the level
that I'm at, you know?

27:16.128 --> 27:18.897
I can't even go to the beach
with my shirt off, right?

27:18.931 --> 27:22.368
Like, look, don't get me wrong,
ladies, I'm in shape, okay?

27:22.401 --> 27:26.505
But I'm just a small guy
with really nice hair.

27:26.538 --> 27:30.042
So from the back, I look like
a really hot Asian chick.

27:31.910 --> 27:35.848
And from the front, I look like
a really hot Asian chick.

27:35.881 --> 27:37.516
Thank you guys. That's my time.
I'm Will Chu.

27:37.549 --> 27:41.587
I will be your host tonight.

27:41.620 --> 27:44.123
Pennsylvania, are you guys ready
for your next comedian?

27:45.891 --> 27:48.560
Alright, you've seen him
at clubs and colleges.

27:48.594 --> 27:51.964
Let's give it up
for Chris Palmer.

28:11.350 --> 28:14.320
What the fuck is up,
Pennsylvania Improv?

28:14.353 --> 28:16.622
Make some fucking noise.

28:18.023 --> 28:21.060
Oh, my God. Fantastic.

28:21.093 --> 28:23.295
Let me...
Anybody in here single?

28:25.130 --> 28:26.865
Anybody in here married?

28:28.434 --> 28:30.402
That is the first time
the married people

28:30.436 --> 28:33.439
have ever been
more enthusiastic.

28:33.472 --> 28:36.041
Well, good, so there's
some good marriages in here?

28:37.309 --> 28:39.044
You guys?
I heard you guys are...

28:39.078 --> 28:40.879
oh, he did this.

28:40.913 --> 28:43.282
He went like this.
Not a good sign.

28:43.315 --> 28:44.583
Great.

28:44.616 --> 28:47.419
Are we ever going to see
a good headline

28:47.453 --> 28:50.522
that starts with the words
"a Florida man"?

28:53.025 --> 28:57.062
Hi. I'm Will, and I just want
to say what an absolute honor

28:57.096 --> 28:59.498
it is to be working with you.

28:59.531 --> 29:04.303
And "Oh, Billy."

29:04.336 --> 29:06.472
I'm going to ask you
not to do that, okay?

29:06.505 --> 29:08.173
Okay. Yes. Noted.

29:08.207 --> 29:10.109
About my intro.

29:10.142 --> 29:11.644
Just say "You know our headliner

29:11.678 --> 29:14.413
from his numerous appearances
on 'The Tonight Show, '

29:14.446 --> 29:17.983
his best-selling book that's for
sale after the show on sale.

29:18.016 --> 29:19.418
I got you this time.

29:19.451 --> 29:22.054
Of course the TV show,
'Oh, That Billy.'

29:22.087 --> 29:23.489
Ladies and gentlemen, Billy G."

29:23.522 --> 29:25.290
You got it?

29:25.324 --> 29:27.192
- Write it down.
- Yeah.

29:27.226 --> 29:29.595
"The Tonight Show,"
book on sale,

29:29.629 --> 29:31.497
I got you this time,

29:31.530 --> 29:33.633
"Oh, That Billy."

29:33.666 --> 29:36.335
I'm sorry.
Can I borrow a pen?

29:36.368 --> 29:39.071
Thank you.
Close that door on the way out.

29:39.104 --> 29:41.206
- Thank you so much.
- Okay.

29:43.976 --> 29:46.713
You have to be
careful these days

29:46.746 --> 29:49.381
with what you're watching on TV

29:49.415 --> 29:51.550
when you're talking
to your lady. Okay?

29:51.583 --> 29:54.654
A little while back, I was
dating a wonderful young lady.

29:54.687 --> 29:56.656
She called me on the phone
and I picked it up,

29:56.689 --> 29:58.457
and after about a minute
she goes,

29:58.490 --> 30:00.727
"Who the fuck is over
at your apartment?"

30:00.760 --> 30:02.561
And I was like,
"What are you talking about?"

30:02.594 --> 30:05.998
And she was like, "Somebody is
screaming, somebody is moaning."

30:06.031 --> 30:09.435
I said, "Babe, I am watching
singles ladies tennis.

30:09.468 --> 30:14.006
Maria Sharapova screams
like a hyena when she plays.

30:14.039 --> 30:15.441
Thank God you didn't
call me five minutes ago.

30:15.474 --> 30:17.276
I was watching mixed doubles.

30:17.309 --> 30:19.278
Would have sounded
like a goddamn orgy in here."

30:22.214 --> 30:23.482
Fantastic.

30:23.515 --> 30:25.517
That's fucking right.

30:25.551 --> 30:28.053
Hey, deejay, kick that track.

30:30.389 --> 30:33.292
Guys, I'm gonna be
selling merch back there.

30:33.325 --> 30:35.461
The T-shirts say
"Getting Chrissy with it."

30:35.494 --> 30:37.630
And a couple of you
will have the great souvenir

30:37.664 --> 30:39.431
of actually getting
Chrissy with it.

30:39.465 --> 30:41.166
Thank you very much,
good night.

30:47.105 --> 30:51.410
One more time for Chris Palmer,
ladies and gentlemen.

30:51.443 --> 30:53.680
Pennsylvania, you guys
ready for your headliner?

30:56.215 --> 30:59.485
You've seen him on his numerous
appearances

30:59.518 --> 31:01.353
on "Oh, That Billy."

31:01.386 --> 31:04.490
And, uh, his book...
best-selling book

31:04.523 --> 31:07.559
is for sale after the show,
"The Tonight Show."

31:07.593 --> 31:10.062
And, um...

31:10.095 --> 31:12.699
And... And of course you know
him from his TV show,

31:12.732 --> 31:16.034
"I Got You This Time."

31:16.068 --> 31:18.170
Let's give it up for Billy G.

31:25.210 --> 31:27.579
Couldn't find that pen, huh?

31:36.388 --> 31:38.357
What's up, Pennsylvania?
How you doing?

31:41.193 --> 31:42.662
One, two, three...

31:42.695 --> 31:44.631
"Oh, Billy."

31:44.664 --> 31:46.265
"Oh, Billy."

31:55.140 --> 31:57.242
I was born Billiard Goulet...

31:57.276 --> 31:58.645
Those two right there, please.

31:58.678 --> 32:02.414
And papa was a rolling stone,
was he not?

32:02.447 --> 32:04.717
Everybody goes,
"Why go by Billy G?"

32:04.751 --> 32:07.219
And I said, "If your name
was Billiard, wouldn't you?"

32:09.354 --> 32:11.623
Nobody wants to be
behind the 9 ball...

32:11.658 --> 32:13.760
Will, let's go get a drink,
buddy.

32:13.793 --> 32:15.628
- Well, I'm watching Billy.
- Oh, I know.

32:15.662 --> 32:17.329
We're not going to
leave the club or anything.

32:17.362 --> 32:19.164
We're just going to watch him
from the back there.

32:19.197 --> 32:21.500
Trust me, you're going to be
sick of his act by Sunday too.

32:21.533 --> 32:22.735
You got kids?

32:22.769 --> 32:25.270
I got kids all different ages,
man.

32:25.304 --> 32:27.707
I got one daughter
who just got out of college.

32:27.740 --> 32:29.374
And you can applause for that.

32:31.376 --> 32:33.780
She didn't... She didn't
graduate or anything.

32:33.813 --> 32:34.881
She just got out.

32:36.849 --> 32:38.350
Oh, my God.

32:38.383 --> 32:40.853
Holy shit, you killed it, Chris.

32:40.887 --> 32:43.790
You too. That fucking
elevator bit's a killer.

32:43.823 --> 32:45.557
You know, they do sexting.

32:45.591 --> 32:47.292
I tried to do that
with my girl, you know?

32:47.326 --> 32:49.561
I'll try sexting her.
I said the other day,

32:49.595 --> 32:52.197
I was like,
"Hey, baby, what's up?"

32:52.230 --> 32:56.301
You know? "Daddy about
to pull up," you know?

32:56.335 --> 32:58.671
"I might want to...."

32:58.705 --> 33:00.907
She texts me back,
"Pick up some bread."

33:03.175 --> 33:04.844
Hey, Chrissy, I got Billy G

33:04.877 --> 33:06.746
doing four radio stations
tomorrow.

33:06.779 --> 33:09.414
But one station still wants a
comic for their Friday funnies.

33:09.448 --> 33:11.818
So I need you to get up at
7:00 AM and do press for me.

33:11.851 --> 33:12.885
7:00 AM?

33:12.919 --> 33:14.887
Yeah, if you want to keep
working at my club, yeah.

33:14.921 --> 33:18.457
Can I bring Will?

33:18.490 --> 33:20.893
Yeah, if that helps you get up
for a 7:00 AM wake up.

33:20.927 --> 33:23.428
Sure.
Ricky will pick you up.

33:23.462 --> 33:27.399
Will, I got my eyes
and ears on you.

33:30.435 --> 33:33.505
See you at 7:00 AM.

33:33.538 --> 33:35.440
- I've never done radio before.
- Don't worry about it.

33:35.474 --> 33:37.576
It's easy. You just do a joke
or two from your act.

33:37.609 --> 33:38.878
Piece of cake.

33:38.911 --> 33:41.246
Oh, we're in business, buddy.
Hello.

33:41.279 --> 33:43.415
Excuse me, I'm here
to redeem my coupon.

33:43.448 --> 33:45.685
Good for one free drink
with a comedian.

33:45.718 --> 33:48.387
- Hope it's good for two.
- Take a look at that.

33:48.420 --> 33:51.390
Yes, it is.
Not valid in Hawaii or Alaska.

33:51.423 --> 33:53.492
I'm Chris.
This is my friend Will.

33:53.525 --> 33:55.260
- You guys were so funny.
- Like, we're dead.

33:55.293 --> 33:57.730
Like sick funny,
like we're not alive, yeah.

33:57.764 --> 34:00.800
And I tell you what, my own son,
on a count of three,

34:00.833 --> 34:02.601
he came off the breast
and he said...

34:02.635 --> 34:04.971
"Oh, Billy.,"

34:11.010 --> 34:13.612
"Oh, Billy."

34:13.646 --> 34:16.949
Hey, that's my time, guys.

34:16.983 --> 34:19.886
Thank you, Pennsylvania.

34:27.894 --> 34:30.328
Oh, Billy,
you killed it tonight.

34:34.767 --> 34:37.269
"Oh, Billy."

34:37.302 --> 34:39.872
Bro, it is time
for the night shift to begin.

34:39.906 --> 34:43.408
We, and I mean we, are heading
next door to the pub.

34:43.442 --> 34:45.577
But don't we have radio first
thing in the morning tomorrow?

34:45.610 --> 34:47.847
I mean, maybe we should stay
fresh and just kind of chill.

34:47.880 --> 34:50.582
Dude, did you just rock
your first fucking improv?

34:50.615 --> 34:52.350
- I think so.
- Yeah, you did.

34:52.384 --> 34:54.954
Oh, my God, you are,
like, so hilarious.

34:54.987 --> 34:57.322
So I think we should
take a victory lap.

34:57.355 --> 34:59.025
Besides, you'd be the first
comic I've ever met

34:59.058 --> 35:00.960
who wants to go to bed
after a great set.

35:00.993 --> 35:02.594
Aren't you fucking wired, bro?

35:02.628 --> 35:04.396
- A little bit.
- A little bit?

35:04.429 --> 35:06.398
And, like, comedy, like, for me,
like, I'm just going to say,

35:06.431 --> 35:09.501
like, I've never even noticed,
but comedy is, like, so funny.

35:09.534 --> 35:12.905
That's a fantastic observation.
These two are very astute.

35:12.939 --> 35:14.974
Okay, okay, I kind of just want
to talk to Billy

35:15.007 --> 35:16.341
for a little bit.

35:16.374 --> 35:17.977
Suit yourself.

35:18.010 --> 35:20.579
Meet me there, okay?

35:20.612 --> 35:23.315
- Hold my hand.
- Yes, you got it.

35:30.522 --> 35:32.491
Hey, you. How's things?

35:32.524 --> 35:35.494
Well, the condo makes my place
look like the Four Seasons.

35:35.527 --> 35:38.463
That nice, huh?
How'd your set go?

35:38.497 --> 35:40.032
- I'm still standing.
- Give me more.

35:40.066 --> 35:42.300
- How's Billy G?
- Oh, boy.

35:42.334 --> 35:43.803
What?

35:43.836 --> 35:46.773
I messed up his intro tonight.
I'm going to fix it.

35:46.806 --> 35:48.841
I don't know, I don't want
to talk about it right now.

35:48.875 --> 35:50.442
You'll get it right tomorrow.

35:50.475 --> 35:52.044
I still don't want
to talk about it.

35:52.078 --> 35:54.412
You know? It's just kind of
fresh and painful right now.

35:54.446 --> 35:56.716
- How are you?
- Good. Good.

35:56.749 --> 35:59.417
Long day, but still have
to finish my lesson plan

35:59.451 --> 36:01.954
and grade 32 book reports
on "Oh, the Places You'll Go."

36:01.988 --> 36:03.756
And throw away
18 macaroni necklaces

36:03.790 --> 36:05.390
that have been in my car
for three weeks.

36:05.423 --> 36:08.795
Nice. You can make
mac and cheese out of those.

36:08.828 --> 36:10.428
Look,
I'm going to head to bed.

36:10.462 --> 36:11.898
- Love you.
- I love you.

36:20.372 --> 36:23.643
Oh, sorry.

36:23.676 --> 36:25.377
- Hey.
- Here he is.

36:25.410 --> 36:26.913
Let's get to work, dude.

36:26.946 --> 36:29.015
So just a heads up, I actually
have a girl back home.

36:29.048 --> 36:31.616
Oh, you know what?
Just a heads up, so do I, yeah.

36:31.651 --> 36:35.554
Back in Miami.
And Indy, Toledo, and Austin.

36:35.587 --> 36:38.057
And I've got one
right out there too. Mm.

36:38.090 --> 36:39.725
Just keep her friend
busy for me, okay?

36:39.759 --> 36:41.794
That's all I ask.
Just be a wingman.

36:43.963 --> 36:46.065
Come on.
Come on, buddy.

36:46.098 --> 36:47.800
How long were you
going to make me wait?

36:47.834 --> 36:49.735
Oh, I'm sorry, are we having
our first fight?

36:49.769 --> 36:52.939
- Are we married?
- Mm-hmm.

36:52.972 --> 36:56.943
I love a guy
that can make me laugh.

36:56.976 --> 36:59.444
Oh, okay, okay. So actually,
I have a girlfriend.

36:59.477 --> 37:01.914
That's cool.
I have a boyfriend.

37:07.787 --> 37:09.121
Thanks, I'm okay.

37:09.155 --> 37:11.523
Got you.
Not the kissing kind.

37:11.556 --> 37:12.892
Oh, okay.

37:12.925 --> 37:16.028
That is my cue to exit.

37:16.062 --> 37:19.397
Nice meeting you. Bye-bye.

37:20.099 --> 37:22.768
Megan. Megan.

37:22.802 --> 37:24.569
Hey, shy guy.

37:24.603 --> 37:26.706
Where are all the party peoples?

37:26.739 --> 37:28.506
Whoo!

37:29.742 --> 37:32.410
Will, I'm so sorry to do this.

37:32.444 --> 37:34.113
Can you actually make sure
Sophie gets home okay?

37:34.146 --> 37:37.482
She's way too wasted
to take a cab by herself.

37:37.515 --> 37:40.186
Oh, and shit,
that was funny on stage before

37:40.219 --> 37:43.421
with the jokes,
so good... good job.

37:43.455 --> 37:44.556
You're the best, bud.

37:44.589 --> 37:45.858
Second best.

37:45.892 --> 37:48.861
He's the best.

37:48.895 --> 37:50.495
Where is everyone?

37:50.528 --> 37:51.931
Hi.

37:51.964 --> 37:52.999
Hello.

37:53.032 --> 37:56.434
Hello.

37:56.468 --> 37:57.703
So, where to, kids?

37:57.737 --> 37:58.971
Where do you live?

37:59.005 --> 38:02.708
Um, um, um, um,
267 Wildwood Lane.

38:02.742 --> 38:05.477
267 Wildwood Lane, and
we're coming right back here.

38:05.510 --> 38:06.879
- So two stops.
- We're coming right back here.

38:06.913 --> 38:09.115
- Wildwood Lanes.
- Whoo!

38:09.148 --> 38:11.651
That's a bit of a trip.
I'm going to need cash up front.

38:11.684 --> 38:12.718
Going to need cash up front.

38:12.752 --> 38:13.986
- What?
- Yeah.

38:14.020 --> 38:15.888
That's what the man said.

38:15.922 --> 38:18.658
<i>Más, cabron.</i>

38:18.691 --> 38:20.993
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Yeah, <i>más</i> means more.

38:21.027 --> 38:22.828
<i>Más.</i> More.

38:22.862 --> 38:24.462
Come on, let's go.

38:24.496 --> 38:25.665
Let's go!

38:32.838 --> 38:35.540
How far are we?

38:35.573 --> 38:37.009
Are you sure
this is where you live?

38:37.043 --> 38:39.511
What even is time?

38:39.544 --> 38:42.048
Are we on a dirt road?

38:55.194 --> 38:57.529
Okay, looks like, uh,
this is it.

38:57.562 --> 39:00.232
This place is weird, man.

39:00.266 --> 39:02.101
Oh, I'm home. Come on in.

39:02.134 --> 39:04.203
No, no, no, I got an early thing
tomorrow in the morning.

39:04.236 --> 39:05.871
Come on. Hungry?

39:05.905 --> 39:08.207
- I have Hot Pockets.
- No, no, no, no thanks.

39:08.240 --> 39:10.209
Oh, my God. Okay.

39:10.242 --> 39:11.509
I got it.

39:11.543 --> 39:13.646
Okay. She...

39:13.679 --> 39:15.648
Shit.

39:15.681 --> 39:17.950
Shit.

39:17.984 --> 39:19.185
Okay, I'm just going to
help her in.

39:19.218 --> 39:20.219
I'll be right back.

39:20.252 --> 39:21.954
I have a bad feeling about this.

39:21.988 --> 39:23.823
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

39:23.856 --> 39:25.623
Getting some bad vibes
around here.

39:25.658 --> 39:27.793
Stay right here.
I'll be right back.

39:27.827 --> 39:29.295
My knight in shining armor.

39:29.328 --> 39:32.064
No, no, no, come on.

39:32.098 --> 39:34.033
Hey, where you going?

39:34.066 --> 39:36.002
Fuck, he has my phone.

39:36.035 --> 39:40.172
Yes, 267 Wildwood Lanes, okay?

39:40.206 --> 39:41.907
- I need to get out of here.
- Happy new year!

39:41.941 --> 39:44.143
So if anybody can come get me
in just under 45 minutes,

39:44.176 --> 39:46.012
I'll pay them double, okay?

39:46.045 --> 39:48.114
Okay?

39:48.147 --> 39:50.716
Haven't seen my phone, have you?

39:50.750 --> 39:52.018
Unh-unh.

39:52.051 --> 39:54.253
Damn it.

39:57.323 --> 40:00.726
You really packing
some heat there, huh?

40:00.760 --> 40:02.094
Yeah.

40:02.128 --> 40:05.965
No, I'm just talking
about the guns, but...

40:05.998 --> 40:07.933
Yeah.

40:07.967 --> 40:10.136
Give me that dick.

40:14.840 --> 40:17.843
Psyche.
It's not even loaded.

40:17.877 --> 40:20.046
- But you are.
- Shut up.

40:20.079 --> 40:21.613
Just a little.

40:21.647 --> 40:23.082
I really need
to get out of here.

40:23.115 --> 40:25.084
Promise I won't tell anybody.

40:25.117 --> 40:28.020
You know what, no, no,
I-I've asked you nicely already.

40:28.054 --> 40:30.622
Okay, let's just...

40:30.656 --> 40:32.858
Holy shit.

40:32.892 --> 40:35.361
- What?
- My boyfriend's here.

40:35.394 --> 40:36.862
- What?
- He'll kill you.

40:36.896 --> 40:38.664
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

40:48.941 --> 40:50.643
Bye.

40:50.676 --> 40:52.577
Baby.

40:54.346 --> 40:56.614
Somebody call?

40:56.649 --> 41:00.252
A really dirty girl?

41:00.286 --> 41:03.823
That pussy better be as tight as
it was when I left this morning.

41:07.359 --> 41:09.628
Christ.

41:09.662 --> 41:10.963
That was a long-ass day.

41:10.996 --> 41:13.365
10 hours of non-stop bullshit.

41:13.399 --> 41:15.868
I need it. Let's lock and load.

41:15.901 --> 41:19.738
I'm on it.
Let's do it.

41:19.772 --> 41:22.942
Oh, yes.

41:22.975 --> 41:26.178
Yes.

41:26.212 --> 41:28.380
Oh, God, yes.

41:32.451 --> 41:34.120
Oh, baby.

41:49.735 --> 41:51.036
Could have been you.

41:53.205 --> 41:54.907
What?

41:57.042 --> 41:58.811
C-Could you have been you.

41:58.844 --> 42:01.981
Like... like, um,
like the 50 Cent song

42:02.014 --> 42:05.851
because you love 50
and I love 50.

42:05.885 --> 42:08.187
And that's just what
I always think about

42:08.220 --> 42:10.156
when I'm taking care of my man.

42:10.189 --> 42:12.224
Oh, baby.
Let's get horizontal,

42:12.258 --> 42:14.126
then tomorrow Red Lobster.

42:14.160 --> 42:15.394
Yay!

42:15.427 --> 42:17.096
Get up here.

42:34.980 --> 42:36.215
Sorry about that, man.

42:36.248 --> 42:38.417
I was a bit creeped
out back there.

42:40.920 --> 42:43.189
- This is yours.
- Holy shit, thank you.

42:43.222 --> 42:45.024
Don't thank me.
Thank your friend Chip.

42:45.057 --> 42:47.893
He called you like
12 times on the phone.

42:47.927 --> 42:50.062
- Chip.
- Come on, let's go, man.

42:50.095 --> 42:51.430
I've got radio
in the morning.

42:51.463 --> 42:53.199
Yeah, and I'm Jeff Gordon.

43:01.540 --> 43:03.075
I'm sorry you had to see this,

43:03.108 --> 43:05.144
but a gal's gotta have
her beauty routine.

43:05.177 --> 43:07.046
Don't look at me, I'm hideous.

43:07.079 --> 43:08.247
Night, Chris.

43:08.280 --> 43:09.748
Love you, bud.

43:16.155 --> 43:19.191
Where's my little guy?

43:19.225 --> 43:21.260
Where's my little guy?

43:21.293 --> 43:23.028
Will, it's radio time.

43:23.062 --> 43:24.797
Come on,
you sweet little pea pea.

43:27.399 --> 43:28.834
Let's do it.

43:33.839 --> 43:37.509
The cop was there
the whole time.

43:37.543 --> 43:41.080
And it was insane. Just staring.
And...

43:41.113 --> 43:44.149
Holy shit, dude,
that is a crazy story.

43:44.183 --> 43:46.885
I'm sorry I left you with her,
but that's fucking funny.

43:46.919 --> 43:48.988
Fuck you, Chris.

43:49.021 --> 43:51.090
Hey, yo, I got
to stay back here

43:51.123 --> 43:52.258
but I got to handle
some shit, alright?

43:52.291 --> 43:54.026
Alright.

44:05.871 --> 44:07.339
Chris, hey. Hey, baby.

44:07.373 --> 44:09.108
Randy's psyched to have you
back on the show, man.

44:09.141 --> 44:10.843
- We all are.
- Thank you.

44:10.876 --> 44:12.011
I haven't seeing you since...

44:12.044 --> 44:13.512
Oh, my God, last time I saw you,

44:13.545 --> 44:15.347
did you end up hooking up
with that blonde?

44:15.381 --> 44:17.182
- Blonde?
- The doctor, the blonde,

44:17.216 --> 44:18.484
the hot-ass blonde.

44:18.517 --> 44:20.853
- Not sure I remember.
- You don't re...

44:20.886 --> 44:23.989
Jesus Christ, I'd remember her
for the rest of my life.

44:24.023 --> 44:25.424
- Who is this?
- Oh, this is Will.

44:25.457 --> 44:26.859
He is emceeing this weekend.

44:26.892 --> 44:28.560
Super funny guy.
Is there room for him?

44:28.594 --> 44:30.929
Yeah. You got to share
a mic, though.

44:32.331 --> 44:33.599
It's alright.

44:37.303 --> 44:40.339
And we're back from
the break, y'alls guys.

44:40.372 --> 44:43.008
Our next guest can be seen
yuk-yuking it up this weeked

44:43.042 --> 44:46.111
at the Pennsylvania Improv
with headliner Billy G.

44:46.145 --> 44:50.482
For WGHS's Friday funnies
sponsored by Kirby's Donuts,

44:50.516 --> 44:55.020
please welcome my good buddy
Chris Palmer and...

44:55.054 --> 44:56.889
Will. Will Chu.

44:56.922 --> 44:58.457
Welcome to the Morning Zoo,
fellas.

44:58.490 --> 45:00.559
Oh, you know, Randy
let me just say

45:00.592 --> 45:03.028
from the bottom of my heart,
you're welcome.

45:05.431 --> 45:06.932
Well, Chris, last time
you were in town,

45:06.965 --> 45:09.234
I went and saw your set.
It was hilarious.

45:09.268 --> 45:10.536
The ladies really dig this guy.

45:10.569 --> 45:12.104
- We love him.
- Thank you again.

45:12.137 --> 45:13.505
You know,
when I came back from that show,

45:13.539 --> 45:15.341
I was telling these guys
about your Florida bit,

45:15.374 --> 45:18.210
and I was hoping
you would grace us with it.

45:18.243 --> 45:19.912
For you, anything.

45:19.945 --> 45:22.014
Yeah, Florida man,
so Florida man,

45:22.047 --> 45:24.350
are we ever
going to see a headline

45:24.383 --> 45:27.252
that's good that has
the phrase "a Florida man"?

45:27.286 --> 45:28.320
You guys know
what I'm talking about?

45:28.354 --> 45:30.255
It's always "a Florida man

45:30.289 --> 45:33.325
claims his wife
was kidnapped by holograms."

45:33.359 --> 45:36.929
Or "a Florida man set fire
to his apartment complex

45:36.962 --> 45:39.264
because his landlord told him
to stop masturbating

45:39.298 --> 45:42.034
in front his windows."
I mean, what's next?

45:42.067 --> 45:46.939
"A Florida man saves another
Florida man from a Florida man"?

45:46.972 --> 45:49.007
Love it, love it. I love it.

45:50.643 --> 45:52.044
Did you guys know that

45:52.077 --> 45:54.380
Ponce de Leon
discovered Florida?

45:54.413 --> 45:57.616
So he was looking
for the fountain of youth,

45:57.650 --> 46:00.986
and I don't know if you guys
have been to Florida lately,

46:01.019 --> 46:03.322
but it's not definitely
not in Florida.

46:07.159 --> 46:09.361
So, uh, Will, what's going on
in your world?

46:09.395 --> 46:12.564
Oh, well, this guy had
a little adventure last night,

46:12.598 --> 46:13.700
right, pal?

46:13.733 --> 46:15.300
I don't think I want to talk...

46:15.334 --> 46:17.069
Come on, it's live radio.
Give us something, buddy.

46:17.102 --> 46:18.937
- Dish.
- Have at it.

46:18.971 --> 46:22.474
I ended up in a cab with a very
nice young lady last night.

46:22.508 --> 46:24.476
And she was trying
to hook up with me.

46:24.510 --> 46:26.512
But I have a girlfriend back...

46:26.545 --> 46:30.115
Uh-oh.
- And then what happened?

46:30.149 --> 46:33.185
So I jumped out of a window
of her trailer

46:33.218 --> 46:37.256
because her boyfriend pulled up
and he was a police officer.

46:37.289 --> 46:41.093
And let's just say
he really knows

46:41.126 --> 46:43.228
how to blow off some steam.

46:47.433 --> 46:50.235
Like, he... he knows how
to blow off some steam.

46:50.269 --> 46:52.037
We heard it.

46:52.070 --> 46:53.706
Okay, Will,
this is the Friday funnies.

46:53.740 --> 46:57.509
Why don't you try giving us
something funny?

46:57.543 --> 46:59.611
Okay, so I'm from Ohio.

46:59.646 --> 47:02.347
- Boo.
- Come on.

47:02.381 --> 47:05.350
- Originally I was from Kansas.
- That's not funny either.

47:05.384 --> 47:06.653
Alright, let's check in
with Bill

47:06.686 --> 47:08.520
and hear about
this weekend's weather.

47:08.554 --> 47:10.556
Okay, this weekend's forecast,

47:10.589 --> 47:12.191
going to be a good one,
Zoo Crew.

47:12.224 --> 47:13.726
- Friday...
- What am I looking at here?

47:13.760 --> 47:15.360
'Cause I want to be prepared.

47:15.394 --> 47:17.996
Alright, Friday is sunny
with a high of 70 degrees.

47:18.030 --> 47:21.300
Whoo, cotton T's, capri pants,
open-toed sandals, ladies SPF15.

47:21.333 --> 47:24.236
Saturday is sunny
with a high of 76 degrees.

47:24.269 --> 47:27.740
Tank top, cut-offs,
flip-flops, SPF30.

47:27.774 --> 47:30.576
And Sunday, we got
a high of 82 degrees.

47:30.609 --> 47:34.346
I'm calling sports bra,
no bottoms, barefoot, SPF50.

47:34.379 --> 47:37.717
- You rock, Bill.
- No, Val, you rock.

47:37.750 --> 47:39.051
What's the news?

47:39.084 --> 47:40.586
- Huey Lewis.
- Huey Lewis.

47:42.554 --> 47:43.790
Back to you, Randy.

47:43.823 --> 47:45.624
Alright, as you know,
Friday funnies

47:45.658 --> 47:47.493
is brought to you
by Kirby's Donuts

47:47.526 --> 47:49.027
and I love them.
We all do.

47:49.061 --> 47:50.395
Stop by and see them.

47:50.429 --> 47:52.297
And as a matter of fact,
during the next break

47:52.331 --> 47:54.566
I will finally sink my teeth
into that éclair

47:54.600 --> 47:57.737
that I've been eying
for the past 45 minutes.

47:57.770 --> 48:00.172
Big thanks to Kirby's Donuts.

48:00.205 --> 48:03.275
And a big thanks to Chris
and Willie from the Improv.

48:03.308 --> 48:05.277
Go see them this weekend.
They're performing with Billy G.

48:05.310 --> 48:09.314
We will be right back.

48:09.348 --> 48:11.049
Boom.
Alright.

48:11.083 --> 48:13.452
Hey, thanks for
coming in, fellas.

48:13.485 --> 48:15.822
Alright.

48:15.855 --> 48:17.289
What the fuck?

48:20.693 --> 48:22.528
Did you eat my éclair?

48:24.831 --> 48:26.532
Yes.

48:26.565 --> 48:29.134
I'm... I'm... I'm sorry
I didn't know it was yours.

48:29.167 --> 48:30.402
I can just go get another one.

48:30.435 --> 48:32.504
Like... Like, do you want me to
go get another one for you?

48:32.538 --> 48:33.605
Hey, thanks for coming in,
Chris.

48:33.640 --> 48:35.407
Always good to see you, buddy.

48:35.440 --> 48:37.309
Was it at Wrigley's Donuts?
I'm so sorry. I really didn't...

48:37.342 --> 48:40.212
- Hey, other comic.
- You're on a roll, my friend.

48:47.452 --> 48:50.255
- Dude.
- Whoa.

48:50.289 --> 48:51.523
You had chocolate on your face

48:51.557 --> 48:53.492
the whole time
he was yelling at you.

48:53.525 --> 48:56.261
They got a picture of it
online too, dawg.

48:56.295 --> 48:57.496
What?

48:57.529 --> 48:58.765
Oh, come...
That is uncalled for.

48:58.798 --> 49:02.635
- Oh, nice.
- Yeah.

49:02.669 --> 49:04.837
I could look at this all day.

49:04.871 --> 49:06.138
Let's get out of here,
man.

49:06.171 --> 49:07.539
- Okay.
- Yeah, of course.

49:07.573 --> 49:09.308
- Dude, we got you.
<i>- Hey guys.</i>

49:09.341 --> 49:11.744
<i>I love Chris Palmer.
Great comic, great comic.</i>

49:11.778 --> 49:14.413
<i>Comes in, funny. Just funny.</i>

49:14.446 --> 49:17.850
I mean, I love everyone.
I'll give anyone a shot.

49:17.884 --> 49:19.418
Some guys just don't get it.

49:19.451 --> 49:21.153
<i>Some guys just
don't know the game.</i>

49:21.186 --> 49:22.521
<i>- Who?</i>
<i>- Who?</i>

49:22.554 --> 49:24.389
<i>That douche,
that open mic douche.</i>

49:24.423 --> 49:26.625
<i>Walt, Willie, Wally,
whatever his name was.</i>

49:26.659 --> 49:28.627
- Who cares.
- He comes in here...

49:28.661 --> 49:30.195
- Not funny.
- Unh-unh.

49:30.228 --> 49:31.864
- Can you just turn that down?
- Sure, sure.

49:31.898 --> 49:33.565
<i>So he comes in here,</i>

49:33.599 --> 49:35.534
<i>stinks up the place
with a horrible joke.</i>

49:35.567 --> 49:38.136
<i>Every time he talked,
it was just, "Ugh, who cares?"</i>

49:38.170 --> 49:39.672
<i>You know, he's got
no future in comedy.</i>

49:39.706 --> 49:42.574
No charisma.
Chris has charisma. And then...

49:42.608 --> 49:44.343
Okay, maybe just
change the channel.

49:44.376 --> 49:46.211
- Yeah, of course.
- Course.

49:46.244 --> 49:48.614
He ate the only thing
I wanted in that box of donuts.

49:48.648 --> 49:50.582
I looked forward to it all week.

49:50.616 --> 49:53.485
<i>And that little bitch ate it.
He ate it. His jokes ate it.</i>

49:53.518 --> 49:56.588
<i>His jokes stunk.
Stink, stank, stunk.</i>

49:56.622 --> 49:58.725
<i>- It smells so bad in here.</i>
<i>- I feel sick.</i>

49:58.758 --> 50:00.660
<i>So if you want to see a great
show this weekend</i>

50:00.693 --> 50:03.328
at the Improv, go see Billy G
and Chris Palmer.

50:03.362 --> 50:04.797
But if the show starts at 8:00,

50:04.831 --> 50:07.599
show up at at 8:15
after that "comedian" is done.

50:07.634 --> 50:09.869
<i>- Ugh.</i>
<i>- With his awful comedy.</i>

50:09.902 --> 50:11.570
<i>Or if you do show up,
matter of fact,</i>

50:11.603 --> 50:13.673
<i>if you do show up, boo him.</i>

50:13.706 --> 50:15.742
<i>You know why?
Because Ohio sucks.</i>

50:15.775 --> 50:19.478
<i>Boo that pig from Ohio
that ate my goddamn éclair.</i>

50:19.511 --> 50:20.813
<i>- Boo. Boo him.</i>
<i>- Boo.</i>

50:20.847 --> 50:22.214
<i>Checking traffic...</i>

50:24.416 --> 50:27.920
Ohhh.

50:27.954 --> 50:29.856
Oh, shit.

50:37.229 --> 50:38.965
Chris, thanks for waking up
early to do press.

50:38.998 --> 50:42.267
- Sure thing.
- Will.

50:42.300 --> 50:43.736
You're on a short leash.

50:43.770 --> 50:45.604
Well, I-I didn't know
he was going to get...

50:45.638 --> 50:48.641
That was live on the radio.
The whole city heard it.

50:48.675 --> 50:50.208
This is my business.

50:50.242 --> 50:52.344
And you made my business
look really bad.

50:52.377 --> 50:54.479
Well, I thought maybe
I was just making myself

50:54.513 --> 50:57.784
- look really bad and...
- And you're working at my club,

50:57.817 --> 51:00.753
hence my club looks bad.

51:00.787 --> 51:02.454
That's strike one, Will.

51:09.629 --> 51:11.263
That was pretty bad, huh?

51:11.296 --> 51:13.365
Eh, just have some great sets.
He'll get over it.

51:13.398 --> 51:14.566
You think so?

51:14.599 --> 51:17.536
Eh, 50/50.

51:17.569 --> 51:20.405
Whew. Lunch, Willy boy.
My treat, baby.

51:23.375 --> 51:24.811
So, look, want to go
into the city tomorrow

51:24.844 --> 51:26.545
and hit up that Warhol Museum?

51:26.578 --> 51:27.914
Yeah, sure.

51:27.947 --> 51:30.683
My God.

51:30.717 --> 51:33.786
So there's coleslaw and fries
inside of the sandwich?

51:33.820 --> 51:35.353
How did you find this place?

51:35.387 --> 51:37.289
Well, when you're on the road
40 weeks a year,

51:37.322 --> 51:38.825
you get to know the spots.

51:38.858 --> 51:42.294
Philly, Geno's cheese steaks.
Cinci, Skyline chilli.

51:42.327 --> 51:43.963
D.C., Ben's Chili Bowl.

51:43.996 --> 51:46.632
San Jose, Original Joe's.

51:46.666 --> 51:49.902
Plus there's
a lot of ass in here.

51:49.936 --> 51:52.437
- She is so hot.
- I think she can hear you.

51:52.471 --> 51:54.306
Oh, I hope so.

51:54.339 --> 51:56.008
How about you? How do you write?

51:56.042 --> 51:57.810
Well, I think of
something that I think is funny,

51:57.844 --> 51:59.544
and then I go on stage
and I talk about it.

51:59.578 --> 52:00.713
And then I talk
until they laugh.

52:00.747 --> 52:02.982
- That's it. Easy.
- That's brave.

52:03.015 --> 52:04.984
I-I don't know if I can
trust myself that much.

52:05.017 --> 52:06.719
I need to plan everything out.

52:06.753 --> 52:08.721
Well, look, I got three weeks
left on the road,

52:08.755 --> 52:11.289
and then I am moving to L.A.,
baby.

52:11.323 --> 52:12.658
- L.A.?
- Mm-hmm.

52:12.692 --> 52:13.893
Why not New York City?

52:13.926 --> 52:16.996
So you make 50 bucks
a show emceeing.

52:17.029 --> 52:18.597
And then you're going to emcee
for a few years

52:18.631 --> 52:20.599
to build your way up
to featuring like me.

52:20.633 --> 52:22.334
And then you do that
for a few years,

52:22.367 --> 52:23.870
making a 100 bucks a show,
which is still shit money.

52:23.903 --> 52:25.604
And then you're going
to want to headline

52:25.638 --> 52:27.039
to make the big bucks, right?

52:27.073 --> 52:29.008
Well, nobody's going to
book you to headline

52:29.041 --> 52:30.643
unless you've got a TV credit.

52:30.676 --> 52:31.944
And you don't get a TV credit

52:31.978 --> 52:34.412
unless you go to New York
or L.A.

52:34.446 --> 52:35.982
And L.A. has sunshine.

52:36.015 --> 52:38.684
Plus L.A.'s the big show, okay?
And I'm ready for it.

52:38.718 --> 52:41.721
Get me an agent,
be seen, kill it.

52:41.754 --> 52:44.489
Then you got fuck you money.
It's mailbox money, okay?

52:44.523 --> 52:47.927
You get a Lambo,
pussy all the time.

52:47.960 --> 52:49.929
That's it. What about you?
What's your plan?

52:49.962 --> 52:51.898
I just recently
went all in on stand-up.

52:51.931 --> 52:54.100
So that's why this weekend
is so important to me.

52:54.133 --> 52:56.636
I'm hoping Chip
will book me again.

52:56.669 --> 52:58.037
Hey, ever work
with Billy G before?

52:58.070 --> 52:59.839
Once, a long time ago.

52:59.872 --> 53:01.473
Look, I liked that dude
when I was a kid,

53:01.506 --> 53:04.076
but he hasn't done shit
in what, 15 years?

53:04.110 --> 53:05.577
Well, I think he's incredible.

53:05.610 --> 53:07.647
Look, Will, I get it.
He's done shit.

53:07.680 --> 53:09.882
Great. He's yesterday.

53:09.916 --> 53:11.818
We are tomorrow.

53:11.851 --> 53:13.853
But he's accomplished
what every comic wants.

53:13.886 --> 53:16.555
He has an hour special
that everybody can quote.

53:16.588 --> 53:18.758
He has a TV show
that runs 24 hours a day.

53:18.791 --> 53:20.358
The guy's a TV star.

53:20.392 --> 53:21.994
<i>Was</i> a TV star.

53:22.028 --> 53:23.996
Well, he's still
an idol of mine.

53:26.632 --> 53:28.466
Holy cow, what is it?

53:28.500 --> 53:30.402
Planet of the eights in here?

53:32.171 --> 53:33.806
See what I did with
the title of the movie?

53:33.840 --> 53:35.141
Yeah, that's
"Planet of the Apes,"

53:35.174 --> 53:36.843
- planet of the eights.
- Uh-huh.

53:36.876 --> 53:38.811
- Yeah, that's a good one.
- He got it.

53:44.750 --> 53:46.152
William, last night,

53:46.185 --> 53:48.553
I went to my favorite
late-night noodle spot.

53:48.587 --> 53:51.489
And I must have butt dialed you
five or six times.

53:51.523 --> 53:53.159
I-I didn't even notice.

53:53.192 --> 53:58.130
You didn't notice that
I called you 6, 8, 12 times?

53:58.164 --> 54:01.000
Well, I, like, lost my phone
for a while.

54:01.033 --> 54:04.637
My cat, Tchaikovsky, died.

54:08.440 --> 54:09.809
Have a great show.

54:09.842 --> 54:11.409
Thank you.

54:11.443 --> 54:13.045
Friday night,
let me hear you.

54:13.079 --> 54:16.115
Who's ready for
a great show tonight?

54:16.148 --> 54:17.817
It's called duck l'orange.

54:17.850 --> 54:19.517
I'll let you make it
for me sometime.

54:19.551 --> 54:21.787
I'm fucking around.
I'll make it for you.

54:21.821 --> 54:23.656
Yo, there's my guy.

54:23.689 --> 54:24.924
Hey, buddy.

54:24.957 --> 54:27.459
Two shows tonight.
Let's kill it.

54:27.492 --> 54:29.695
I think maybe I should wait
until the second show.

54:29.729 --> 54:32.597
It's your first weekend, bud.
Let's do this.

54:32.632 --> 54:35.935
Boom. Mm.

54:35.968 --> 54:38.871
Alrighty. Love it.

54:38.905 --> 54:41.506
Show your love
for your emcee for the night.

54:41.539 --> 54:44.043
He does clubs and colleges
all over the city.

54:44.076 --> 54:47.213
Put your hands together
for Will Chu.

54:50.850 --> 54:52.985
Hey.

54:53.019 --> 54:55.755
What's up, Pennsylvania?
How you guys doing tonight?

54:57.790 --> 55:01.861
Awesome.
What a beautiful crowd, right?

55:01.894 --> 55:06.165
I see a lot of pretty girls
here in Pennsylvania.

55:06.198 --> 55:08.466
Not really here
but, like, in downtown, so...

55:08.500 --> 55:11.637
But you guys are okay.
You guys are okay.

55:11.671 --> 55:14.506
But I think there's one thing
we can all agree on, right?

55:14.539 --> 55:18.044
- Ohio sucks.
- What?

55:18.077 --> 55:19.845
Friday funnies.

55:19.879 --> 55:21.781
That was a good one.

55:21.814 --> 55:23.683
Alright, let's try
this one more time.

55:23.716 --> 55:25.251
I think, as I was saying,

55:25.284 --> 55:28.020
I think there's one thing
we can all agree on, is dating.

55:28.054 --> 55:29.922
Dating is just
a little different now, right?

55:29.956 --> 55:32.725
Everybody made it
out of their cubicle.

55:32.758 --> 55:35.695
Hey, Billy. It was awesome
watching your set last night.

55:35.728 --> 55:38.931
You know that bit about
your kids and breastfeeding?

55:38.965 --> 55:41.267
That's one of
my all-time favorite bits.

55:41.300 --> 55:42.935
Thanks.

55:42.969 --> 55:45.738
So, hey, um,
I was just wondering,

55:45.771 --> 55:47.673
tomorrow can I maybe
take you out for lunch

55:47.707 --> 55:50.076
and just ask you
for some advice?

55:50.109 --> 55:51.811
You know, like, about stand-up?

55:57.549 --> 56:01.253
"Tonight Show,"
book for sale after the show,

56:01.287 --> 56:04.090
"I got you this time,"
"Oh, That Billy."

56:07.259 --> 56:08.894
Thanks.

56:11.596 --> 56:12.965
Anybody do
some day drinking today?

56:14.867 --> 56:18.070
The dude passed out in the back,
that's my kind of day drinker.

56:18.104 --> 56:19.571
- Hell yeah.
- Hey, what's up, man?

56:19.604 --> 56:21.539
- Hey, man.
- You hanging after the show?

56:21.573 --> 56:22.975
- Sure.
- Cool. You smoke?

56:23.009 --> 56:24.677
- Not really.
- Blow?

56:24.710 --> 56:25.878
Definitely not.

56:25.911 --> 56:27.313
Alright.
Try and go to a strip club?

56:27.346 --> 56:30.316
- It's not really my speed.
- Oh, you pop pills?

56:30.349 --> 56:33.285
Ricky, I feel like I'm not
a great hang for you.

56:33.319 --> 56:36.022
- I'll break you.
- Sir, are you guys married?

56:36.055 --> 56:38.623
Yep, you don't seem
too sure, okay.

56:38.657 --> 56:40.026
Hell yeah, Pennsylvania,

56:40.059 --> 56:42.728
you guys are dirty as shit,
and I love it.

56:42.762 --> 56:44.562
Give it up
for yourselves, everybody.

56:44.596 --> 56:46.932
Yeah.

56:46.966 --> 56:49.335
Deejay, kick that jam
one more time.

56:49.368 --> 56:52.604
Peace you all. Love you.

56:55.607 --> 56:57.943
One more time, Chris Palmer,
ladies and gentlemen.

57:01.247 --> 57:03.282
I can't go to
a Chinese restaurant

57:03.315 --> 57:05.317
with white people anymore.

57:05.351 --> 57:08.954
No, seriously, every time
I go to the Chinese restaurant

57:08.988 --> 57:11.090
it's... wait, hang on, hang on.

57:11.123 --> 57:13.092
Is she... She's seriously
on her phone right now.

57:13.125 --> 57:15.661
Do you guys see this? Hello?

57:15.694 --> 57:18.731
Miss, that's got to be
an important phone call.

57:18.764 --> 57:20.633
Hang on a minute.
Who are you talking to?

57:20.666 --> 57:24.703
Who you... Let me get that.
Hang on, hang on. Hang on.

57:24.737 --> 57:28.707
Hello, sir.
I'm assuming it's a sir.

57:28.741 --> 57:32.011
No, it's not.
Oh, hey, ma'am, how are you?

57:32.044 --> 57:33.646
Who is this?

57:33.679 --> 57:37.283
This is a comedian
that you don't know about.

57:37.316 --> 57:38.818
Does your friend
have a boyfriend?

57:38.851 --> 57:40.252
Yeah, his name is Tim.

57:40.286 --> 57:41.821
- And what's your name, sir?
- Hank.

57:41.854 --> 57:44.824
- Ohhh. Who is Hank?
- Who is Hank?

57:44.857 --> 57:46.358
Who is Hank?
I don't know.

57:46.392 --> 57:48.928
Erica is sitting next
to a handsome man named Hank.

57:48.961 --> 57:51.931
Is she married? Like, should
somebody know about this?

57:51.964 --> 57:53.899
This getting scandalous, guys.

57:53.933 --> 57:55.201
Alright, Pennsylvania Improv,

57:55.234 --> 57:56.902
are you guys ready
for your headliner?

57:56.936 --> 57:59.672
Okay, you've seen him

57:59.705 --> 58:02.341
in his numerous appearances
on "The Tonight Show,"

58:02.374 --> 58:05.010
and you read his book,
the national best-seller,

58:05.044 --> 58:06.779
"I Got You This Time."

58:06.812 --> 58:09.048
And of course you know him
for his own television show,

58:09.081 --> 58:10.282
"Oh, That Billy."

58:10.316 --> 58:13.185
Let's give it up for Billy G!

58:24.263 --> 58:25.698
- Alright, enjoy that book now.
- Trust me,

58:25.731 --> 58:27.066
- you can't afford me.
- Okay.

58:27.099 --> 58:28.400
I would come and strip
for your friend,

58:28.434 --> 58:30.202
but it ain't going to happen.
It's too steep.

58:30.236 --> 58:32.138
Hey, Will, come here a second.

58:32.171 --> 58:33.873
I'll catch up with you guys.

58:33.906 --> 58:35.841
- Yes, sir?
- Lunch tomorrow.

58:35.875 --> 58:37.943
- Seriously?
- Dougherty's at noon.

58:37.977 --> 58:39.378
Absolutely. I will...
I'll be there.

58:39.411 --> 58:43.149
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, noon.
- It's a date.

58:43.182 --> 58:45.384
No, it's just food
and conversation.

58:45.417 --> 58:47.887
- It's not a date.
- Sorry, that was stupid.

58:47.920 --> 58:50.055
It's not a date.
But I'll see you there.

58:53.325 --> 58:55.794
Seriously, he said
lunch tomorrow.

58:58.397 --> 59:02.234
Cool. Will, every weekend,
God willing,

59:02.268 --> 59:04.803
one of your shows
will have a bachelorette party.

59:07.973 --> 59:10.976
- Will, I'm fucking again.
- Good for you.

59:11.010 --> 59:12.211
Thank you.

59:19.852 --> 59:23.055
Alright, I can do that to you.

59:23.088 --> 59:24.356
Alright, see you, bud.

59:36.468 --> 59:39.471
Will, where the fuck
you been, man?

59:39.505 --> 59:41.307
- Right here.
- Anyhoo, I'm about to go to

59:41.340 --> 59:43.042
Slappy's Mess
and the strip club.

59:43.075 --> 59:45.110
- You trying to roll?
- I'm good.

59:45.144 --> 59:46.845
You want some ecstasy?

59:46.879 --> 59:49.481
- Is everything okay back home?
- I'mma hug you now.

59:49.515 --> 59:52.051
Okay.

59:52.084 --> 59:53.485
Thank you.

1:00:08.167 --> 1:00:10.069
Doing the, uh,
Siberian tiger thing.

1:00:10.102 --> 1:00:12.938
You read about this? Mmm.

1:00:12.972 --> 1:00:15.941
One meal a day. It's supposed
to simulate what they do.

1:00:15.975 --> 1:00:18.143
Love you, bud.

1:00:28.153 --> 1:00:34.793
Pick up.

1:00:34.827 --> 1:00:36.095
Hey, Billy.

1:00:36.128 --> 1:00:39.265
Let me ask you something.

1:00:39.298 --> 1:00:41.233
Why do you want to do this?

1:00:41.267 --> 1:00:43.936
I grew up watching stand-up.

1:00:43.969 --> 1:00:45.304
My dad loves stand-up.

1:00:45.337 --> 1:00:47.106
And that's all we did.

1:00:47.139 --> 1:00:49.241
You know some kids, like,
they bond with their dads

1:00:49.275 --> 1:00:51.510
watching baseball, basketball?

1:00:51.543 --> 1:00:53.879
We watched stand-up.
We watched Eddie Murphy,

1:00:53.912 --> 1:00:55.547
we watched you,
we watched Billy G.

1:00:55.581 --> 1:00:59.084
Like, when I was 8 years old,
that was, like, my shit, man.

1:00:59.118 --> 1:01:01.487
- Yeah.
- And, I mean,

1:01:01.520 --> 1:01:04.523
I've always wanted
to be a stand-up.

1:01:04.556 --> 1:01:07.259
I just... I just love it.

1:01:07.293 --> 1:01:09.862
How much you work a night?

1:01:09.895 --> 1:01:11.997
I do like a 12-minute set.

1:01:12.031 --> 1:01:15.901
12 minutes? That's it?

1:01:15.934 --> 1:01:17.303
So how much time
do you think

1:01:17.336 --> 1:01:20.572
that the people
who come see our shows work?

1:01:20.606 --> 1:01:23.242
Every week? What do you
think they work a day?

1:01:23.275 --> 1:01:25.511
- Eight hours a day?
- Eight hours.

1:01:25.544 --> 1:01:27.579
- Yeah.
- Five days a week.

1:01:27.613 --> 1:01:31.383
Alright, so now do you think
that you deserve a shot

1:01:31.417 --> 1:01:33.485
before you go and do 12 minutes?

1:01:33.519 --> 1:01:35.621
When somebody's been
working all week?

1:01:35.655 --> 1:01:37.589
If you put it that way,
no, I guess not.

1:01:37.623 --> 1:01:39.892
No, you do not deserve a shot.

1:01:39.925 --> 1:01:41.560
You want to be a party guy,

1:01:41.593 --> 1:01:43.929
turn up, as the kids say...

1:01:43.962 --> 1:01:45.030
that's what y'all say, right?

1:01:45.064 --> 1:01:46.565
"I'm going to turn up."

1:01:46.598 --> 1:01:48.400
And that's fine.
You know, some people come down,

1:01:48.434 --> 1:01:50.469
that's all they want to do
is have a good time,

1:01:50.502 --> 1:01:53.405
hang out in the green room,
get laid, you know?

1:01:53.439 --> 1:01:55.240
And eat some Cheetos.

1:01:55.274 --> 1:01:57.109
But you got to respect
that audience.

1:01:57.142 --> 1:01:59.278
Do your job first.

1:01:59.311 --> 1:02:01.180
Mmm.

1:02:01.213 --> 1:02:02.281
This alright, right here, man.

1:02:02.314 --> 1:02:05.084
You ever had some of this?

1:02:05.117 --> 1:02:06.452
Taste that.

1:02:06.485 --> 1:02:08.087
Take a little bite here.

1:02:08.120 --> 1:02:09.455
See, get that up in you.

1:02:09.488 --> 1:02:11.023
- Mmm.
- What?

1:02:11.056 --> 1:02:13.492
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

1:02:13.525 --> 1:02:15.427
Do you have any advice
for, like, a young comic?

1:02:15.461 --> 1:02:17.896
Like, what should I be doing?

1:02:17.930 --> 1:02:21.233
I'mma tell you two things.

1:02:21.266 --> 1:02:23.636
- Write it down.
- Okay.

1:02:23.670 --> 1:02:26.505
Be...

1:02:26.538 --> 1:02:29.141
funny.

1:02:29.174 --> 1:02:30.643
Funny.

1:02:33.612 --> 1:02:38.685
I'm fucking with you, man.

1:02:38.718 --> 1:02:40.619
- I wrote it down.
- I'm fucking with you.

1:02:40.653 --> 1:02:44.156
Okay, look, no, but for real.
Two things.

1:02:44.189 --> 1:02:46.959
Write and get on stage.

1:02:46.992 --> 1:02:50.062
- That's it?
- That's it.

1:02:50.095 --> 1:02:52.531
Yeah, I'm actually working on
this bit. So it's about...

1:02:52.564 --> 1:02:54.099
Look, I don't want to hear
about your bits.

1:02:54.133 --> 1:02:55.501
I don't want to hear
about your bits.

1:02:55.534 --> 1:02:57.637
Good for you.
You got a new bit, great.

1:02:57.670 --> 1:02:59.204
Keep working on it.
Work it out.

1:02:59.238 --> 1:03:01.708
But don't...
don't tell me about no bits.

1:03:01.741 --> 1:03:03.375
Okay.

1:03:03.409 --> 1:03:06.178
So you want to know
when do you become a comic?

1:03:06.211 --> 1:03:08.313
Most young kids, they believe

1:03:08.347 --> 1:03:10.315
it's about when they
a headliner, right?

1:03:10.349 --> 1:03:13.051
Even being a headliner
don't mean you a comic.

1:03:13.085 --> 1:03:15.487
When you find
your own point of view,

1:03:15.521 --> 1:03:18.257
get your own voice,
get selfish with that shit.

1:03:18.290 --> 1:03:20.693
Get... Say stuff that means
something to you on the inside

1:03:20.727 --> 1:03:22.194
and make you laugh.

1:03:22.227 --> 1:03:24.664
Larry the Cable Guy. Gaffigan.

1:03:24.697 --> 1:03:26.331
Chris Rock. Katt Williams.

1:03:26.365 --> 1:03:28.967
When I say these names,
you can already envision

1:03:29.001 --> 1:03:30.402
- their audience, right?
- Mm-hmm.

1:03:30.436 --> 1:03:32.337
That's 'cause
they talking to their audience.

1:03:32.371 --> 1:03:34.406
They audience find them.
That's what you got to do.

1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:36.208
Find your voice.

1:03:36.241 --> 1:03:40.012
You find your voice,
your audience will find you.

1:03:40.045 --> 1:03:44.049
And that's when
you're a comedian.

1:03:44.082 --> 1:03:45.451
What about you?

1:03:45.484 --> 1:03:47.519
The funny thing is
when I first started this,

1:03:47.553 --> 1:03:51.089
I used to think
that I had to make them laugh

1:03:51.123 --> 1:03:53.091
so that I could feel good.

1:03:53.125 --> 1:03:57.095
But over time, I realized
that I make them laugh

1:03:57.129 --> 1:03:59.331
so that they feel good.

1:03:59.364 --> 1:04:01.433
It's the best job in the world.

1:04:03.670 --> 1:04:05.103
Give you one other thing
real quick.

1:04:05.137 --> 1:04:06.238
Write this down.

1:04:06.271 --> 1:04:10.242
Billy is leaving.

1:04:10.275 --> 1:04:11.644
Yeah.

1:04:21.220 --> 1:04:23.255
Willy boy.

1:04:23.288 --> 1:04:24.590
What's up, bro?

1:04:24.623 --> 1:04:26.225
I'm working out
this new joke tonight.

1:04:26.258 --> 1:04:27.760
So I just want to
run it over a couple...

1:04:27.794 --> 1:04:31.563
Yeah, don't try out new jokes
on a Saturday, bud.

1:04:31.597 --> 1:04:34.199
Do that Sunday or Thursday,
not tonight.

1:04:34.233 --> 1:04:40.305
Good evening, and welcome
to the world-famous Improv.

1:04:40.339 --> 1:04:44.243
Saturday night,
make some noise.

1:04:44.276 --> 1:04:47.412
I said, Saturday night,
make some noise.

1:04:48.514 --> 1:04:50.382
Now, please welcome to the stage

1:04:50.415 --> 1:04:52.084
your emcee for the night.

1:04:52.117 --> 1:04:54.186
He does clubs and colleges.

1:04:54.219 --> 1:04:57.155
Put your hands together
for Will Chu.

1:05:01.226 --> 1:05:05.063
Hey, what's up?

1:05:05.097 --> 1:05:07.099
What's up, Pennsylvania?

1:05:07.132 --> 1:05:09.736
How you guys doing?

1:05:09.769 --> 1:05:12.337
Alright.
Are we having fun tonight?

1:05:12.371 --> 1:05:15.574
Are you guys ready
for some comedy?

1:05:15.607 --> 1:05:16.776
Alright.

1:05:16.809 --> 1:05:18.845
I see a lot of pretty girls
here in Pennsylvania, right?

1:05:18.878 --> 1:05:21.413
Am I right? Yeah.

1:05:21.446 --> 1:05:23.415
Not really here but, like,
in downtown, you know?

1:05:23.448 --> 1:05:26.318
Ohio sucks. Ohio sucks.

1:05:28.554 --> 1:05:32.090
Alright, oh, geez. Sorry.

1:05:35.193 --> 1:05:36.663
Hello?

1:05:36.696 --> 1:05:39.231
Alright, Pennsylvania,
you guys ready to have some fun?

1:05:41.567 --> 1:05:44.403
Okay, I want to talk
about myself tonight.

1:05:44.436 --> 1:05:50.142
And my... my...
my father...

1:05:50.175 --> 1:05:52.244
Actually, my... my...
my girlfriend...

1:05:52.277 --> 1:05:53.512
so I have a girlfriend.

1:05:53.545 --> 1:05:56.148
She's a teacher.
And most people they...

1:05:56.181 --> 1:05:59.719
they usually say
teachers are underpaid, right?

1:05:59.752 --> 1:06:02.789
But I think they're
actually overpaid.

1:06:05.223 --> 1:06:06.893
That's a joke obviously.
I don't... I don't...

1:06:06.926 --> 1:06:14.232
I'm not getting political here
or anything.

1:06:14.266 --> 1:06:16.703
You know, my... my...
my girlfriend called me out.

1:06:16.736 --> 1:06:19.137
I've been a little bit
of a bummer lately.

1:06:19.171 --> 1:06:22.341
And so she said if I was a city,

1:06:22.374 --> 1:06:23.876
I would be like Seattle.

1:06:28.580 --> 1:06:30.182
It's...

1:06:30.215 --> 1:06:35.253
You know, it's...
it's, like, rainy and it's dark.

1:06:35.287 --> 1:06:38.825
And it just...

1:06:38.858 --> 1:06:42.194
Well, so I was
thinking about this.

1:06:42.227 --> 1:06:46.431
I'm like, "Okay, what if
I was to upgrade to a city?

1:06:46.465 --> 1:06:47.934
What city would I upgrade to,
right?

1:06:47.967 --> 1:06:49.736
If it's not for Seattle,

1:06:49.769 --> 1:06:54.606
then maybe I can upgrade
to Flint, Michigan."

1:06:54.641 --> 1:06:56.643
- That's...
- What the fuck is he doing?

1:06:56.676 --> 1:06:57.910
- He's dying.
- Or, you know, what if

1:06:57.944 --> 1:07:00.479
I really upgrade,
like I-I-I hit it big,

1:07:00.512 --> 1:07:02.280
and... and then I make it to,

1:07:02.314 --> 1:07:04.616
I don't know, like, uh...
like Cleveland, right?

1:07:04.651 --> 1:07:06.218
Ohio.

1:07:06.251 --> 1:07:07.854
I wish you would
go back to Cleveland.

1:07:07.887 --> 1:07:09.421
Even Flint.

1:07:11.623 --> 1:07:15.627
Okay.
Actually, this weekend,

1:07:15.662 --> 1:07:18.530
I-I was going to go to Columbus
with my girlfriend.

1:07:18.563 --> 1:07:21.500
You should go meet her
right now. Please.

1:07:21.533 --> 1:07:23.936
Just... Just head there now.

1:07:23.970 --> 1:07:26.238
Well, let's...

1:07:26.271 --> 1:07:27.606
Light him. Light him.

1:07:27.640 --> 1:07:30.208
Where... Where is it? Here?
I'm doing it.

1:07:30.242 --> 1:07:32.812
Are you guys ready
for your next comedian?

1:07:33.946 --> 1:07:36.883
Okay.

1:07:36.916 --> 1:07:38.751
What the fuck happened?

1:07:38.785 --> 1:07:41.788
- I am so sorry.
- On a Saturday night?

1:07:41.821 --> 1:07:43.656
I was just trying to get
personal with my mat...

1:07:43.690 --> 1:07:45.758
Don't get per... What...
It's not "Dr. Phil."

1:07:45.792 --> 1:07:47.259
That's your second strike.

1:07:47.292 --> 1:07:48.761
You know what happens
on the third.

1:07:48.795 --> 1:07:50.863
- It won't happen again.
- Yeah, it certainly won't.

1:07:50.897 --> 1:07:52.632
Because I'm cutting your time
on the next show.

1:07:52.665 --> 1:07:54.634
You're getting five minutes,
that's it,

1:07:54.667 --> 1:07:56.401
and bring up the guest spot.

1:07:56.435 --> 1:07:58.905
Got it.

1:08:01.774 --> 1:08:03.876
Fuck.

1:08:03.910 --> 1:08:06.679
- Yo, thanks, man. Thanks.
- Alright, how you doing, man?

1:08:06.713 --> 1:08:09.281
- Big fan.
- Thank you guys for coming out.

1:08:09.314 --> 1:08:11.483
- Sorry.
- Whoa.

1:08:11.516 --> 1:08:14.319
Thanks for the flashback,
my man.

1:08:14.352 --> 1:08:16.956
Well, you told me
to write more about myself

1:08:16.989 --> 1:08:18.523
so I just thought, you know...

1:08:18.557 --> 1:08:21.560
Yeah. I also said be funny.

1:08:21.593 --> 1:08:24.697
- Jesus.
- You're the emcee, you know?

1:08:24.731 --> 1:08:26.598
Supposed to warm
the place up, you know?

1:08:26.632 --> 1:08:27.867
Yeah, but I never
dealt with hecklers.

1:08:27.900 --> 1:08:29.568
Do a little crowd work
or something.

1:08:29.601 --> 1:08:31.336
I don't know if I'm that good
with crowd work yet.

1:08:31.369 --> 1:08:32.604
What about the other night?

1:08:32.638 --> 1:08:34.506
The lady with the phone.
That was funny.

1:08:34.539 --> 1:08:36.709
Well, that actually happened,
so I was just kind of reacting.

1:08:36.743 --> 1:08:39.879
Exactly. Crowd work. Reacting.

1:08:39.912 --> 1:08:43.415
Hey, Will, come here.

1:08:43.448 --> 1:08:44.717
Sorry.

1:08:44.751 --> 1:08:46.786
Hey, guys, how are you?

1:08:46.819 --> 1:08:48.520
Brooke Bailey...
she's going to run her

1:08:48.553 --> 1:08:49.989
"Tonight Show" set
for next week.

1:08:50.022 --> 1:08:52.725
Don't fuck up her intro too,
okay?

1:08:52.759 --> 1:08:55.661
- Okay.
- Okay.

1:08:55.695 --> 1:08:57.462
Wow, "Tonight Show," congrats.
I'm Will.

1:08:57.496 --> 1:08:59.031
- Hi. Brooke.
- Nice to meet you.

1:08:59.065 --> 1:09:00.733
You too.

1:09:00.767 --> 1:09:03.301
So is there anything you want me
to say for your intro?

1:09:03.335 --> 1:09:05.838
You can just say
the Comedy Cavalcade Tour

1:09:05.872 --> 1:09:07.073
and then I'm doing
"The Tonight Show"

1:09:07.106 --> 1:09:08.941
- on Thursday.
- Okay, cool.

1:09:08.975 --> 1:09:11.711
Finally sold
two fucking T-shirts.

1:09:11.744 --> 1:09:14.747
Making it rain, baby.
Holy shit.

1:09:14.781 --> 1:09:16.783
- Brooke, what's going on?
- Hi. How's it going?

1:09:16.816 --> 1:09:18.785
- So, you doing time?
- I am doing time.

1:09:18.818 --> 1:09:20.485
She's doing "The Tonight Show"
on Thursday.

1:09:20.519 --> 1:09:22.420
What? Then we got to celebrate.

1:09:22.454 --> 1:09:23.823
- Oh, wow.
- Ohh!

1:09:23.856 --> 1:09:25.490
The lovely Miss Bailey.

1:09:25.524 --> 1:09:26.692
- How are you?
- Good to see you.

1:09:26.726 --> 1:09:27.960
Oh, goodness.

1:09:27.994 --> 1:09:29.361
Heard you got
"The Tonight Show."

1:09:29.394 --> 1:09:31.030
- Yeah.
- I called Jimmy, alright?

1:09:31.063 --> 1:09:32.832
- I told him to take care of you.
- You're the best.

1:09:32.865 --> 1:09:34.901
- Thank you.
- Well, I mean, you deserve it.

1:09:34.934 --> 1:09:36.903
You're talented. You work hard.
Come on.

1:09:36.936 --> 1:09:38.905
Like I told you,
I said first thing first...

1:09:38.938 --> 1:09:40.438
No, what you would
always say to me

1:09:40.472 --> 1:09:42.541
is don't write down
jokes in your phone.

1:09:42.574 --> 1:09:44.644
Always write it on a piece
of paper with a pen

1:09:44.677 --> 1:09:46.078
because it makes it
more personal.

1:09:46.112 --> 1:09:47.747
Doing your thing,
super talented.

1:09:47.780 --> 1:09:48.915
You deserve this.

1:09:52.551 --> 1:09:55.688
Put your hands together
for Will Chu.

1:09:57.056 --> 1:09:59.025
What's up?

1:09:59.058 --> 1:10:02.394
Packed house tonight
on a Saturday.

1:10:02.427 --> 1:10:04.797
A lot of pretty girls
in Pennsylvania, am I right?

1:10:04.831 --> 1:10:06.464
Look at them.

1:10:06.498 --> 1:10:09.836
Ohio sucks. Ohio sucks.

1:10:09.869 --> 1:10:12.370
Ohio sucks.

1:10:13.605 --> 1:10:17.076
Okay.

1:10:17.109 --> 1:10:20.813
How are you guys doing?

1:10:20.847 --> 1:10:22.748
Mother and daughter?

1:10:22.782 --> 1:10:24.449
Yeah.

1:10:24.482 --> 1:10:27.552
- Where's... Where's Dad?
- Oh, he's not with us.

1:10:27.586 --> 1:10:30.990
Okay. Is he, like, fishing?
Or bowling?

1:10:31.023 --> 1:10:32.457
He's dead.

1:10:32.490 --> 1:10:33.893
Ohio sucks.

1:10:37.596 --> 1:10:40.498
Nice, uh, pretzels, right?

1:10:40.532 --> 1:10:43.568
- He is not funny.
- Not at all.

1:10:43.602 --> 1:10:46.438
Father and daughter.

1:10:46.471 --> 1:10:50.442
Father and son, right?
That's cool.

1:10:50.475 --> 1:10:53.612
Do you like to eat
chicken wings?

1:10:53.646 --> 1:10:55.513
Why... W-What's up with...

1:10:58.718 --> 1:11:01.486
You know if you split improv
into two words,

1:11:01.519 --> 1:11:03.990
it's kind of like I'm pro,

1:11:04.023 --> 1:11:06.659
with a V at the end.

1:11:11.063 --> 1:11:12.698
Are you guys ready
for your next comedian?

1:11:12.732 --> 1:11:17.136
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1:11:17.169 --> 1:11:20.106
Thanks. Hi, everybody.

1:11:20.139 --> 1:11:22.440
Hello. Hi.

1:11:22.474 --> 1:11:24.176
Wow, thank you, thank you.

1:11:24.210 --> 1:11:27.079
Give it up for, Will.

1:11:27.113 --> 1:11:28.981
It's good to be here.

1:11:29.015 --> 1:11:32.617
I did not Uber here.
I do not Uber.

1:11:32.652 --> 1:11:34.486
All my guy friends
want me to take an Uber

1:11:34.519 --> 1:11:36.588
whenever I'm scared
to walk to my car,

1:11:36.621 --> 1:11:37.823
take an Uber, it's super safe.

1:11:37.857 --> 1:11:39.959
For who? Why... Why is it safe?

1:11:39.992 --> 1:11:41.559
All my guy friends
are like, "What do you mean?

1:11:41.593 --> 1:11:42.695
There's a rating system."

1:11:42.728 --> 1:11:44.897
Oh, really? Is that what was
wrong with hitchhiking?

1:11:44.931 --> 1:11:47.900
There was no rating system?

1:11:47.934 --> 1:11:50.136
I feel like all my mother
ever said to me

1:11:50.169 --> 1:11:51.871
was "do not talk to strangers."

1:11:51.904 --> 1:11:54.674
Now every night
I get in the car with one,

1:11:54.707 --> 1:11:56.976
I show him where I live,

1:11:57.009 --> 1:11:58.978
and then I eat his candy.

1:12:03.950 --> 1:12:06.953
- Yeah, of course, of course.
- Thank you so much.

1:12:06.986 --> 1:12:08.654
Oh, yes.

1:12:08.688 --> 1:12:10.122
- Thanks.
- Bye.

1:12:10.156 --> 1:12:11.757
I don't know, actually,

1:12:11.791 --> 1:12:14.727
if there are different
belts in kickboxing.

1:12:14.760 --> 1:12:16.528
I just do the YouTube videos.

1:12:16.561 --> 1:12:19.464
Yo, let's definitely hit up
that Warhol tomorrow, okay?

1:12:26.005 --> 1:12:28.540
Uh, look, Chip,
I'm... I'm sorry about...

1:12:28.573 --> 1:12:30.109
Not now, Will.
I think we can both agree

1:12:30.142 --> 1:12:32.678
that stand-up's not
in the cards for you.

1:12:32.712 --> 1:12:34.680
Can't think of any reason for
you to come out tomorrow night,

1:12:34.714 --> 1:12:36.983
but thanks for coming in.

1:12:41.921 --> 1:12:42.955
Hey.

1:12:42.989 --> 1:12:44.123
What?

1:12:44.156 --> 1:12:46.092
You the comedian?

1:12:46.125 --> 1:12:47.827
Apparently not.

1:12:47.860 --> 1:12:52.098
Are you the comedian Will Chu
who was on the radio?

1:12:52.131 --> 1:12:54.566
Look, man, I know Ohio
sucks, alright?

1:12:54.599 --> 1:12:58.971
Will Chu who told a story
on the radio

1:12:59.005 --> 1:13:03.042
where you ended up in a trailer
with a girl who had a boyfriend?

1:13:03.075 --> 1:13:06.078
And you were in my fucking home,
drinking my beers?

1:13:06.112 --> 1:13:09.081
When I found two open beers,
I couldn't understand

1:13:09.115 --> 1:13:11.851
why does my girl
have two open beers?

1:13:11.884 --> 1:13:14.220
I don't get it.
Are you that Will Chu

1:13:14.253 --> 1:13:17.990
who lives at 223 Clark Street
in Steubenville?

1:13:18.024 --> 1:13:19.759
It is too late to say no?

1:13:19.792 --> 1:13:21.127
Ow!

1:13:21.160 --> 1:13:22.995
I never laid my hands on her.

1:13:23.029 --> 1:13:25.297
No shit.

1:13:25.331 --> 1:13:26.999
And by the way,
no one will fucking believe you

1:13:27.033 --> 1:13:29.702
if you tell them what I did.
I've done it a bunch.

1:13:37.810 --> 1:13:39.245
<i>What's up?
You've reached Jen.</i>

1:13:39.278 --> 1:13:40.780
<i>Well, not actually.
I'm not here.</i>

1:13:40.813 --> 1:13:41.814
<i>You know what to do.</i>

1:13:43.349 --> 1:13:44.650
Hey, babe.

1:13:44.683 --> 1:13:46.719
I just got back.

1:13:46.752 --> 1:13:49.822
Thought I'd give you a call.

1:13:49.855 --> 1:13:51.690
Things are going
pretty okay here.

1:13:54.660 --> 1:13:59.265
Y-You know what, maybe...
maybe it's not so good.

1:13:59.298 --> 1:14:02.968
Actually, it's a pretty
fucking horrible night.

1:14:05.738 --> 1:14:09.642
Maybe stand-up is just not
really in the cards, you know?

1:14:09.675 --> 1:14:12.945
Maybe I just don't have it.

1:14:14.980 --> 1:14:16.248
Bye.

1:14:50.850 --> 1:14:54.619
<i>Hey, Will. Lunch.</i>

1:15:06.866 --> 1:15:11.036
Hey.

1:15:11.070 --> 1:15:12.738
Oh.

1:15:12.771 --> 1:15:14.807
Whoa.

1:15:14.840 --> 1:15:17.409
Whoa, man, what happened
to your eye?

1:15:17.443 --> 1:15:19.712
Well, a cop punched me
in the face

1:15:19.745 --> 1:15:21.247
because I was hanging out
with his girl.

1:15:21.280 --> 1:15:24.083
That's fucking awesome.

1:15:24.116 --> 1:15:26.051
That's fucking awesome.

1:15:29.889 --> 1:15:32.858
Yeah, well, just getting
something to eat,

1:15:32.892 --> 1:15:34.894
then I'm hitting the road.

1:15:34.927 --> 1:15:38.297
Whoa, wait... wait a minute.
What about tonight?

1:15:41.200 --> 1:15:42.434
There's no tonight.

1:15:42.468 --> 1:15:44.737
I'm heading back to Ohio.

1:15:44.770 --> 1:15:47.306
Didn't you quit your job
to do this?

1:15:47.339 --> 1:15:50.843
Yeah, but you saw
what I did last night.

1:15:50.876 --> 1:15:53.779
Yeah, you bombed.
Bombed hard, too.

1:15:53.812 --> 1:15:56.749
Shit, your ass should be
on a TSA watch list.

1:15:56.782 --> 1:16:00.286
Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Will Chu.

1:16:00.319 --> 1:16:02.421
Chip said I'm done.

1:16:02.454 --> 1:16:04.290
Chip said?

1:16:04.323 --> 1:16:06.859
Chip said you're done?
What about you?

1:16:06.892 --> 1:16:08.294
You... You say it's over?

1:16:08.327 --> 1:16:11.163
Man, you know what?

1:16:11.197 --> 1:16:13.232
Go on. Go on.
Get the fuck out of here, man.

1:16:13.265 --> 1:16:15.067
If that's all it takes,
go ahead on.

1:16:15.100 --> 1:16:18.904
Bye. Bye. Who gives a damn?

1:16:18.938 --> 1:16:21.373
You saw me.
It went terrible.

1:16:21.407 --> 1:16:22.975
You actually should
be proud of yourself.

1:16:23.008 --> 1:16:24.410
Y-You going quick.

1:16:24.443 --> 1:16:26.345
You... You... You actually quit
your job, man.

1:16:26.378 --> 1:16:28.047
Quit your job,
drove your ass down here.

1:16:28.080 --> 1:16:30.916
Been getting on the stage.
You're actually doing it.

1:16:30.950 --> 1:16:32.751
One, two bad shows,
and now that's it.

1:16:32.785 --> 1:16:34.019
That's all it take?

1:16:34.053 --> 1:16:36.055
Ain't the last no
you going to get.

1:16:36.088 --> 1:16:37.489
You're going to hear
a whole avalanche

1:16:37.523 --> 1:16:39.391
of no's you stay
in this business.

1:16:39.425 --> 1:16:41.827
There's going to be shows
that you want going to be a no.

1:16:41.860 --> 1:16:43.229
You're going to get shows
that you're hired on,

1:16:43.262 --> 1:16:45.197
they're going to fire you.

1:16:45.231 --> 1:16:47.466
You're going to have things
that your friends book

1:16:47.499 --> 1:16:49.134
that you thought
you should book

1:16:49.168 --> 1:16:50.903
because you believe
you funnier than they are.

1:16:50.936 --> 1:16:52.171
You're going to
write a new joke,

1:16:52.204 --> 1:16:54.273
you're going to be out on that
stage, you're going to try it,

1:16:54.306 --> 1:16:55.541
and that audience
is going to be like,

1:16:55.574 --> 1:16:57.977
"No, I want to hear
all the old shit."

1:16:58.010 --> 1:17:03.282
But guess what is more powerful
than all of those no's.

1:17:03.315 --> 1:17:05.117
Your belief in yourself.

1:17:07.119 --> 1:17:09.388
You know, what happened
to you last night, sure,

1:17:09.421 --> 1:17:11.257
it's the worst thing
that can happen to a comic.

1:17:11.290 --> 1:17:15.227
You bombed.
And in a spectacular fashion.

1:17:15.261 --> 1:17:19.231
I mean, boom.

1:17:19.265 --> 1:17:20.432
You in pain?

1:17:20.466 --> 1:17:24.370
No, not really.
Just a shiner.

1:17:24.403 --> 1:17:27.873
No, no, no, you in pain.

1:17:27.906 --> 1:17:29.975
You in pain, I'm in pain.

1:17:30.009 --> 1:17:32.978
That's... That's what
the life of a comic is, man.

1:17:33.012 --> 1:17:35.481
We take our pain.
We got to find that stuff.

1:17:35.514 --> 1:17:37.216
That's what we take on stage.

1:17:37.249 --> 1:17:40.119
When we find that pain,
got to learn to embrace it.

1:17:40.152 --> 1:17:42.488
Take what's personal and
you give it to that audience,

1:17:42.521 --> 1:17:44.490
and it makes them laugh.

1:17:44.523 --> 1:17:49.194
But the thing about stand-up,
son, you listening?

1:17:49.228 --> 1:17:53.198
Is that you have a chance
to be better today

1:17:53.232 --> 1:17:54.933
than you was yesterday.

1:18:04.877 --> 1:18:06.345
It's another show tonight.

1:18:16.322 --> 1:18:19.325
If he was the one
that's, like, doing the...

1:18:19.358 --> 1:18:25.431
If he's like, "Ohio sucks,"
first... first and...

1:18:25.464 --> 1:18:29.068
If you think about it, like,
Neil... Neil Armstrong...

1:18:37.910 --> 1:18:40.145
<i>Hey. I got your message.</i>

1:18:40.179 --> 1:18:42.147
<i>So you had a bad weekend.</i>

1:18:42.181 --> 1:18:45.484
<i>You don't give up on something
you love that much so quickly.</i>

1:18:45.517 --> 1:18:47.886
<i>Give me a call.
We can talk about it.</i>

1:18:47.920 --> 1:18:51.523
<i>I'm here for you, Will.
I believe in you. I love you.</i>

1:19:03.535 --> 1:19:06.071
Hey, Will, glad to see you.

1:19:06.105 --> 1:19:08.474
- You are?
- Yeah, you just reminded me

1:19:08.507 --> 1:19:10.476
I'm supposed to take your name
down from the marquee.

1:19:10.509 --> 1:19:13.245
Okay, about that, is Chip here?

1:19:13.278 --> 1:19:14.947
Yeah, he's in the office.

1:19:14.980 --> 1:19:16.683
- Can I talk to him?
- Yeah.

1:19:16.716 --> 1:19:20.152
T Dog for Captain Crunch.

1:19:20.185 --> 1:19:22.287
Yeah, little kamikaze's
here to see you.

1:19:22.321 --> 1:19:25.391
Yeah.

1:19:25.424 --> 1:19:27.192
Hey, Chip.

1:19:27.226 --> 1:19:29.061
I was going to text you.
We need to settle up.

1:19:29.094 --> 1:19:30.362
Before you say anything,

1:19:30.396 --> 1:19:35.134
I'm here begging you
for one last set.

1:19:35.167 --> 1:19:36.969
What happened to your face?

1:19:37.002 --> 1:19:40.038
I had a really,
really rough night.

1:19:40.072 --> 1:19:41.974
I don't give a shit, Will.

1:19:42.007 --> 1:19:44.476
This is all I got, man.
Stand-up is all I got.

1:19:44.510 --> 1:19:47.546
Then you don't got much because
you're not good at stand-up.

1:19:47.579 --> 1:19:49.649
I started off okay, right?

1:19:49.682 --> 1:19:52.618
Let me just finish the weekend
the same way I started.

1:19:52.652 --> 1:19:54.253
And if I'm really no good,

1:19:54.286 --> 1:19:57.289
then you'll never hear
from me again.

1:19:57.322 --> 1:19:59.458
Please. I promise.

1:20:04.329 --> 1:20:06.265
One last spot.

1:20:06.298 --> 1:20:09.334
Yes, thank you. Thank you, Chip.

1:20:12.337 --> 1:20:14.072
Okay.

1:20:16.643 --> 1:20:20.612
Welcome to
the world-famous Improv.

1:20:20.647 --> 1:20:23.248
Sunday night, make some noise.

1:20:27.085 --> 1:20:29.121
Dude, what the fuck?

1:20:29.154 --> 1:20:32.424
This fucking cock wad
I sold a T-shirt to last night

1:20:32.458 --> 1:20:34.560
just came up to me in the lobby
wanting to return it.

1:20:34.593 --> 1:20:37.062
Who the fuck returns a T-shirt?

1:20:37.095 --> 1:20:38.363
I'm sorry to hear that.

1:20:38.397 --> 1:20:40.065
Anyway, buddy, I'm telling you,

1:20:40.098 --> 1:20:42.401
that fucking shiner
looks so dope.

1:20:42.434 --> 1:20:44.704
You are going to be
like a chick magnet tonight.

1:20:44.737 --> 1:20:47.372
Anyway, bro,
grand finale tonight.

1:20:47.406 --> 1:20:49.308
I'm pumped to hear
what's in that book, buddy.

1:20:49.341 --> 1:20:51.176
You're going to kill it.

1:20:51.210 --> 1:20:54.346
- Thanks.
- You got it, bro.

1:20:54.379 --> 1:20:56.482
My "pleazh."

1:20:56.515 --> 1:20:58.417
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll be starting the show

1:20:58.450 --> 1:21:00.118
in just a few moments.

1:21:00.152 --> 1:21:03.222
There's no video or flash
photography during the show.

1:21:08.695 --> 1:21:11.129
Now, before we get started,
I got to let you know

1:21:11.163 --> 1:21:12.632
to keep your talking
to a minimum

1:21:12.665 --> 1:21:15.033
but your laughter to a maximum.

1:21:15.067 --> 1:21:16.736
Who's ready for
a good show tonight?

1:21:18.604 --> 1:21:20.072
I can't hear you.

1:21:20.105 --> 1:21:22.541
Who's ready for
a good show tonight?

1:21:25.277 --> 1:21:29.615
Put your hands together
for Will Chu.

1:21:34.419 --> 1:21:36.789
What's up, Pennsylvania?

1:21:36.823 --> 1:21:39.191
How you guys doing?

1:21:39.224 --> 1:21:40.626
Awesome.

1:21:40.660 --> 1:21:44.363
So, as you guys can tell,
I got this black eye.

1:21:44.396 --> 1:21:46.532
The reason is when I went
outside the other day...

1:21:46.565 --> 1:21:51.270
Ohio sucks.
Ohio sucks. Ohio sucks.

1:21:53.572 --> 1:21:57.376
Okay.

1:21:57.409 --> 1:21:59.578
Ohio sucks, right?

1:21:59.611 --> 1:22:01.113
Ohio sucks.

1:22:01.146 --> 1:22:02.414
Ohio sucks.

1:22:02.447 --> 1:22:03.850
Everybody,
why don't everybody do it?

1:22:03.883 --> 1:22:08.387
Ohio sucks, Ohio sucks,
Ohio sucks.

1:22:08.420 --> 1:22:11.791
Yeah, you know what?
M-Maybe these guys are right.

1:22:11.824 --> 1:22:14.092
Ohio does kind of suck, right?

1:22:14.126 --> 1:22:16.461
Is there anybody from Ohio?

1:22:16.495 --> 1:22:18.096
Good, yeah,
there's a reason why.

1:22:19.732 --> 1:22:22.702
Right, look, look, actually,
actually, if you think about it,

1:22:22.735 --> 1:22:25.270
Ohio is where legends are born.

1:22:25.304 --> 1:22:26.371
Legends, right?

1:22:26.405 --> 1:22:27.372
If you think about it,

1:22:27.406 --> 1:22:29.408
we got the Wright Brothers,

1:22:29.441 --> 1:22:31.811
first in flight... from Ohio.

1:22:31.844 --> 1:22:34.546
John Glenn, first man in space,

1:22:34.580 --> 1:22:37.249
from Ohio, right?

1:22:37.282 --> 1:22:42.421
Neil Armstrong, first man
on the moon... from Ohio.

1:22:42.454 --> 1:22:45.490
So if history
has taught us anything,

1:22:45.524 --> 1:22:49.428
it's taught us that
men will do anything

1:22:49.461 --> 1:22:52.164
to get the fuck up out of Ohio.

1:22:52.197 --> 1:22:55.367
Right? Right?

1:22:57.402 --> 1:22:59.872
So maybe it does suck,
I don't know.

1:22:59.906 --> 1:23:02.541
I don't know. Right?

1:23:05.243 --> 1:23:07.714
So my dad passed away
a few years ago.

1:23:07.747 --> 1:23:09.281
Not to bum anybody out.

1:23:09.314 --> 1:23:11.383
People die all the time,
even Asians.

1:23:11.416 --> 1:23:13.720
It's okay.

1:23:13.753 --> 1:23:15.187
You know, we don't age
but we die.

1:23:15.220 --> 1:23:16.923
It's okay, it's fine.

1:23:16.956 --> 1:23:19.859
So stand-up was like me
and my father's thing.

1:23:19.892 --> 1:23:21.694
We actually grew up
watching Billy G,

1:23:21.728 --> 1:23:24.664
your headliner tonight,
give it up for Billy G, right?

1:23:24.697 --> 1:23:26.198
And I always wondered, like,

1:23:26.231 --> 1:23:27.900
is he, like, watching me
from upstairs?

1:23:27.934 --> 1:23:29.702
That's what people say
all the time, right?

1:23:29.736 --> 1:23:31.738
Is he watching me work?

1:23:31.771 --> 1:23:35.374
Is he watching me when I'm just
drinking coffee in the morning?

1:23:35.407 --> 1:23:38.410
Is he watching me
when I'm masturbating?

1:23:38.443 --> 1:23:41.279
You know? 'Cause he's probably
got a lot of footage of that.

1:23:42.849 --> 1:23:44.717
Hey, what if he's here tonight
watching me from upstairs

1:23:44.751 --> 1:23:46.218
and he's looking at me
and he's like,

1:23:46.251 --> 1:23:49.354
"Man, that is my son
doing stand-up.

1:23:49.388 --> 1:23:52.557
My only son doing
stand-up comedy.

1:23:52.591 --> 1:23:54.559
And I must say,

1:23:54.593 --> 1:23:56.361
I'd rather
watch him masturbate."

1:24:03.301 --> 1:24:04.569
Ohio sucks.

1:24:04.603 --> 1:24:06.471
Ohio sucks.

1:24:06.505 --> 1:24:08.240
Ohio sucks.

1:24:44.944 --> 1:24:46.813
Hey.

1:24:48.981 --> 1:24:52.752
I just want to thank you
for letting me do my last set.

1:24:52.785 --> 1:24:54.987
Here is your check.

1:24:58.057 --> 1:25:02.294
This weekend means more to me
than any amount of money.

1:25:02.327 --> 1:25:03.628
So...

1:25:03.663 --> 1:25:05.898
this is me telling you...

1:25:09.869 --> 1:25:14.306
I need an emcee
in two weeks in Kansas City.

1:25:14.339 --> 1:25:16.876
- You free?
- Absolutely.

1:25:16.909 --> 1:25:18.778
I'm in.

1:25:18.811 --> 1:25:22.849
And I think we confirmed that
you've got my cellphone number.

1:25:22.882 --> 1:25:26.318
Let's just do e-mail.
It's a little more professional.

1:25:26.351 --> 1:25:29.989
Okay, but you know you can
call me anytime you want.

1:25:30.022 --> 1:25:31.590
Thanks, sir.

1:25:31.623 --> 1:25:34.593
Thanks, Chip.

1:25:34.626 --> 1:25:35.995
So it begins.

1:25:36.028 --> 1:25:38.798
Whew. So it begins.

1:25:45.037 --> 1:25:48.007
Deejay: You know your opening
act from the Pennsylvania Improv

1:25:48.040 --> 1:25:50.375
and other clubs and colleges.

1:25:50.408 --> 1:25:54.379
Give it up for Will Chu.

1:25:54.412 --> 1:25:57.349
Kansas City,
how you guys doing?

1:26:04.456 --> 1:26:06.324
You know, I used to be
a full-time physician.

1:26:06.358 --> 1:26:08.627
And I was doing stand-up comedy
on the side.

1:26:08.661 --> 1:26:12.932
And, uh, I was always scared
to make that next step.

1:26:12.965 --> 1:26:15.067
I was a waiter.
It was the greatest job ever.

1:26:15.101 --> 1:26:17.402
I officially never quit.

1:26:17.435 --> 1:26:19.038
I just took a leave of absence.

1:26:19.071 --> 1:26:23.009
I still have my name tag
to this day... true story.

1:26:23.042 --> 1:26:24.744
If this shit don't work out,

1:26:24.777 --> 1:26:27.847
I'm going back to Golden Corral
in Tallahassee.

1:26:27.880 --> 1:26:31.050
My first night doing stand-up,
I actually did really well.

1:26:31.083 --> 1:26:32.685
Like, by accident.

1:26:32.718 --> 1:26:35.353
And then I bombed
for like two years after that

1:26:35.387 --> 1:26:38.825
before I was, you know,
able to get laughs again.

1:26:38.858 --> 1:26:42.394
I was terrible. Horrible.
Just horrendous.

1:26:42.427 --> 1:26:43.763
You got five minutes,

1:26:43.796 --> 1:26:46.933
and I think I did four
at the most maybe.

1:26:46.966 --> 1:26:48.835
And the second time,
I did three.

1:26:48.868 --> 1:26:52.071
You would have thought
I would have gotten longer,

1:26:52.104 --> 1:26:53.505
but I actually got shorter.

1:26:53.538 --> 1:26:55.942
I did some editing.

1:26:55.975 --> 1:26:57.542
So yeah, I guess
it was kind of hard.

1:26:57.576 --> 1:27:01.413
But it was fun
because I loved it.

1:27:01.446 --> 1:27:05.483
And I guess if
I looked at it logically,

1:27:05.517 --> 1:27:07.153
I probably wouldn't
have done it.
