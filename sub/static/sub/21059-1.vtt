<i>Previously on AMC's
"Turn: Washington's Spies"...</i>

00:16.772 --> 00:18.071
Explain yourself, Captain.

00:18.073 --> 00:19.573
We're hanging a traitor, sir.

00:19.575 --> 00:21.274
Get out of my town.

00:21.276 --> 00:22.843
I'm gonna come back to New York soon,

00:22.845 --> 00:24.277
and when I do, be ready.

00:24.279 --> 00:26.980
A woman stealing
Major John André's heart.

00:26.982 --> 00:28.648
Can you style me exactly like this?

00:28.650 --> 00:30.317
Youth, Philomena.

00:30.319 --> 00:32.319
André has been captured. I must flee.

00:32.320 --> 00:33.587
Arnold's a traitor, sir.

00:34.923 --> 00:37.157
The future of our cause lies in peril.

00:37.159 --> 00:39.693
Do we have a man
in the city... Robert Townsend?

00:39.695 --> 00:41.761
Well, I'll find his spies,

00:41.763 --> 00:43.463
and I'll drag them screaming
to the gallows.

01:01.944 --> 01:03.477
Hold up.

01:46.901 --> 01:49.135
She was a beauty, eh?

01:49.237 --> 01:50.736
Nah, she was a jack whore, that one.

01:50.838 --> 01:52.505
A regular horse godmother.

01:52.607 --> 01:54.674
Make your thing look like a noodle,
with paws like that.

01:54.776 --> 01:57.009
Petty Officer James Kilroy.

02:04.552 --> 02:07.119
Hey, where are you taking him?

02:07.766 --> 02:08.911
Come on, he hasn't done anything.

02:09.013 --> 02:10.423
Where are you taking him?

02:10.525 --> 02:12.925
- Where is he going?
- Down at the wharf.

02:18.561 --> 02:20.495
Back after lunch, Cato.

02:41.818 --> 02:45.953
- Tommy. Good morning, Tommy.
- Mr. Mulligan.

02:51.051 --> 02:52.884
Five shillings for two inches?

02:52.986 --> 02:54.586
It's highway robbery.

02:54.688 --> 02:57.355
Honestly, I don't know why
you buy space in that dishrag.

02:57.457 --> 02:59.891
No one reads it. Our
subscribers are double theirs.

02:59.993 --> 03:01.793
Hugh Gaine is an old friend, James.

03:01.895 --> 03:03.395
<i>I'll do you a deal, Mulligan.</i>

03:03.497 --> 03:05.697
Stop all advertising in the "Mercury"

03:05.799 --> 03:07.766
- and we will name you...
- The official clothier

03:07.868 --> 03:10.468
of his "Majesty's Royal Gazette."

03:10.571 --> 03:13.027
- Good morning, Townsend.
- Good morning, sir.

03:13.129 --> 03:14.847
- Ale or sherry?
- Sherry.

03:14.949 --> 03:16.259
On the house.

03:16.362 --> 03:18.559
May I show you the placement? Hmm?

03:18.661 --> 03:21.792
- Near the masthead?
- You wish to see it?

03:21.894 --> 03:24.793
Drink your sherry. I'll be right back.

03:33.549 --> 03:36.751
You look due for a new suit, Townsend.

03:36.853 --> 03:39.120
We Quakers keep our dress plain.

03:39.222 --> 03:40.588
We have little need

03:40.690 --> 03:44.759
for "superfine cloths"
of the most fabulous colors.

03:44.861 --> 03:47.395
Bit much, eh?

03:47.497 --> 03:50.031
Well, still...

03:50.671 --> 03:53.672
to the right reader,
sends the right message.

03:53.774 --> 03:56.908
Just like your advertisement for, say,

03:57.010 --> 03:59.778
French raspberry brandy?

04:25.921 --> 04:29.456
You really should stop by.
We have much to discuss.

04:29.558 --> 04:31.725
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

04:32.366 --> 04:33.799
They said you'd be guarded.

04:35.110 --> 04:37.243
Forgive me, who said?

04:37.345 --> 04:39.345
We have friends in common, Robert.

04:39.448 --> 04:40.647
And you have more friends

04:40.749 --> 04:42.615
in this city than you may know.

04:42.718 --> 04:44.384
<i>Hercules Mulligan.</i>

04:48.288 --> 04:50.955
Good day, sir.
I don't believe we've met.

04:51.057 --> 04:52.957
Oh, I think you know who I am.

04:53.059 --> 04:56.194
- I most certainly know who you are.
- Ah, wonderful.

04:56.770 --> 04:58.937
Stop by Queen Street,
we'll take your measure.

04:59.039 --> 05:00.872
You'll be coming with me now, sir,

05:00.974 --> 05:03.868
to answer for your questionable
contacts with the enemy.

05:05.111 --> 05:07.779
- On what grounds do you harass me, sir?
- General.

05:08.214 --> 05:11.642
You will address me by my rank, tailor.

05:14.693 --> 05:18.164
And where is your regiment, general?

05:18.665 --> 05:21.198
Cross the Hudson wearing rebel blue?

05:21.301 --> 05:23.634
Wandering where their commander
scarpered off to?

05:25.338 --> 05:26.570
<i>He had it coming.</i>

05:26.673 --> 05:28.773
I know precisely who

05:29.575 --> 05:30.874
and what you are.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.637
Please, this is where
we report the war, not wage it.

05:38.739 --> 05:39.605
Print this!

05:39.707 --> 05:41.073
By order of Lord Clinton,

05:41.175 --> 05:43.275
I have been appointed
Spy Hunter General,

05:43.377 --> 05:46.445
and have been tasked to arrest
hidden traitors to the Crown.

05:46.878 --> 05:48.511
Their names will be made known,

05:48.613 --> 05:50.680
and they will learn to fear mine.

05:50.782 --> 05:52.114
Get up.

05:58.678 --> 06:02.079
Please. Please continue.

07:04.335 --> 07:08.671
Adams, Little, Mulligan,

07:09.941 --> 07:14.844
Beddows, Kilroy, Hunter.

07:17.911 --> 07:21.246
Now, Beddows, Kilroy, and Hunter
were all agents of Robert Howe,

07:21.348 --> 07:22.580
who entrusted Arnold with their names

07:22.683 --> 07:23.982
when he took advantage of West Point.

07:24.084 --> 07:25.750
Howe didn't know Mulligan!

07:26.211 --> 07:27.844
<i>No one knew Mulligan except for us.</i>

07:27.946 --> 07:29.646
<i>Arnold doesn't know Mulligan.</i>

07:29.748 --> 07:33.617
- His name is right there.
- Yes, along with 40 others.

07:33.719 --> 07:36.720
Arnold doesn't have the evidence
for 40 men. He's grasping.

07:36.822 --> 07:38.422
He failed to deliver them West Point,

07:38.524 --> 07:40.123
and so he's putting on show,
he's puffing out his chest.

07:40.225 --> 07:43.093
- <i>How can you be sure?</i>
- Because I...

07:45.932 --> 07:47.665
Because he wrote to me.

07:58.622 --> 08:00.022
"As I know you to be a man of sense,

08:00.124 --> 08:02.524
I am conscious you are,
by this time, fully of opinion

08:02.626 --> 08:04.994
<i>that the real interest
and happiness of America</i>

08:05.096 --> 08:07.652
<i>consists in a reunion
with Great Britain.</i>

08:08.259 --> 08:10.392
<i>I have taken a commission
in the British Army</i>

08:10.495 --> 08:11.922
<i>and invite you to join me</i>

08:11.947 --> 08:14.587
<i>with as many men as you
can bring over with you.</i>

08:14.665 --> 08:16.198
<i>If you think it proper
to embrace my offer</i>

08:16.300 --> 08:18.968
<i>you shall have the same rank
you now hold,</i>

08:19.070 --> 08:21.637
<i>in the cavalry I am to raise."</i>

08:25.344 --> 08:27.912
If he knew Woodhull's name,
or Townsend's,

08:28.014 --> 08:29.413
then he surely
would have boasted as much.

08:29.515 --> 08:31.615
The Culper Ring is secure.

08:31.717 --> 08:35.587
- His hunt has just begun.
<i>- He will be</i> the hunted.

08:35.688 --> 08:38.326
We will lure him out
of the city and kill him.

08:38.366 --> 08:41.868
No. I will not lower us
to assassination.

08:41.970 --> 08:45.771
He must be captured alive
and returned to camp.

08:45.874 --> 08:51.598
Sir, you wish to kid... to capture
General Arnold from New York City?

08:51.617 --> 08:53.617
We must make a public example of him.

08:55.735 --> 08:59.236
I want a report on how this may
be best achieved by week's end.

09:12.795 --> 09:14.762
Leave the letter here.

09:24.224 --> 09:27.700
Laundry. Two shillings.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.835
Payday, you trulls.

09:30.937 --> 09:32.704
Maybe I'll buy me a kettle.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.238
Boil up some rat shit.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.074
Save me seconds, love.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.810
Hey, princess, you got
kettles for sale or not?

09:39.412 --> 09:41.980
<i>Princess. She got spunk in her ear?</i>

09:42.082 --> 09:44.482
Save me seconds.

09:49.282 --> 09:51.162
Yes, kettles are three shillings.
I'll be right back.

09:51.264 --> 09:52.864
If something's missing, I'll know.

09:52.966 --> 09:54.299
Why look at me, eh?

09:55.402 --> 09:56.868
Why look at me?

10:00.874 --> 10:02.607
<i>Hey!</i>

10:04.457 --> 10:05.723
Bitch.

10:05.825 --> 10:08.026
Don't ruffle her feathers, Hest.

10:08.128 --> 10:09.927
It's her cart.

10:10.030 --> 10:11.496
Ever wonder how that is?

10:12.272 --> 10:14.305
She didn't come to camp
but five months ago,

10:14.407 --> 10:15.715
and she weren't no peddler then.

10:16.476 --> 10:18.276
Answer's right there.

10:18.378 --> 10:20.311
Young Major Tallmadge.

10:20.413 --> 10:22.914
You said she was yoked to some
fat cull in Philadelphia.

10:23.016 --> 10:25.183
Says the scuttlebutt.

10:25.285 --> 10:27.318
But she don't act married, now does she?

10:28.888 --> 10:31.222
You can't be certain they're safe.

10:31.324 --> 10:35.660
No, I'm not certain, but there's nothing
I can do that I haven't already done.

10:36.508 --> 10:38.374
Oh, and you're not the only one

10:38.477 --> 10:40.076
who's worried sick.

10:40.178 --> 10:41.678
What's this?

10:41.780 --> 10:43.546
I received a few unexpected
letters this week,

10:43.648 --> 10:46.312
that one is from
Philadelphia, from Selah.

10:51.373 --> 10:53.039
- You told him I'm here?
- What?

10:53.141 --> 10:55.242
No, no, he still thinks you're
in Setauket serving as signal,

10:55.344 --> 10:57.344
but with Arnold on a rampage
rounding up spies,

10:57.446 --> 10:58.712
he's fearing for your life.

10:58.814 --> 11:00.435
He's demanding that
I pull you out of there.

11:03.118 --> 11:05.418
I have to write him back.

11:08.056 --> 11:12.158
If he learns I'm in camp, he'll
send for me. Or come for me.

11:13.361 --> 11:15.027
And I won't be able
to help with the ring.

11:15.129 --> 11:17.610
Selah's my friend, I don't
want to have to lie to him.

11:18.265 --> 11:20.466
If you write that I'm safe,

11:20.568 --> 11:23.802
and don't wish to risk more than
that in a letter, it won't be a lie.

11:28.409 --> 11:30.609
Your choice.

11:30.711 --> 11:33.245
I'm more worried about Abe.

11:34.098 --> 11:35.865
I know Washington wants him
to stay where he is,

11:35.967 --> 11:36.999
and you have to follow orders,

11:37.101 --> 11:38.234
- but Abe doesn't.
- Anna.

11:38.336 --> 11:40.669
If a boat was to just show up...

11:40.772 --> 11:42.738
Anna, I told you
there's nothing I can do...

11:42.840 --> 11:44.837
- No, but... -...that I
haven't already done.

11:46.750 --> 11:48.116
Caleb left for Setauket
early this morning

11:48.218 --> 11:49.942
in a boat with plenty of room.

11:50.887 --> 11:53.154
<i>He should be with Abe as we speak.</i>

12:44.354 --> 12:46.287
- Brewster?
- Shh.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.371
Is that Caleb Brewster?

12:53.545 --> 12:55.511
I was right! What about that Arnold, eh?

12:55.613 --> 12:58.181
- What a bastard he is.
- Come here.

13:01.590 --> 13:03.257
What are you doing?

13:03.359 --> 13:05.159
- Someone's coming.
- What?

13:08.497 --> 13:10.898
Oh, no, it's just my father.
Listen, listen.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.499
We gotta work out a new way to signal,

13:12.601 --> 13:14.250
a way for me to signal you
without Townsend,

13:14.352 --> 13:16.170
- Shh!
- without anybody else involved.

13:16.272 --> 13:18.472
Just shut your hole.

13:18.574 --> 13:20.808
We have to go now.

13:20.910 --> 13:23.851
All right? Where's Mary and Thomas?

13:23.953 --> 13:25.379
Whitehall.

13:26.172 --> 13:28.039
It's nearly lunch, she's
probably going to be making...

13:28.141 --> 13:30.272
- hey, you hungry?
- What?

13:30.374 --> 13:32.276
I mean, you smell like arse, but uh...

13:32.378 --> 13:35.413
Ah, she'll be fine. Come on! Come on!

13:35.515 --> 13:37.048
Where are you going?

13:37.150 --> 13:40.418
- Who are you talking to?
- It's Caleb Brewster!

13:41.196 --> 13:42.702
<i>He'll be joining us for lunch!</i>

13:47.268 --> 13:48.500
Come on.

13:52.681 --> 13:53.966
Sugar?

13:55.356 --> 13:56.689
Whiskey?

14:08.996 --> 14:10.723
So...

14:12.186 --> 14:14.120
I take it the lobsters have gone?

14:14.222 --> 14:16.455
No, no, they're not gone.

14:16.557 --> 14:18.758
Wakefield moved his billet
to Strong Manor.

14:18.860 --> 14:21.360
<i>He threw up a stockade, he's
calling it Fort St. George.</i>

14:22.195 --> 14:23.795
<i>He runs the garrison
from there now, though</i>

14:23.897 --> 14:25.625
- they still hold the church.
- Right.

14:25.728 --> 14:27.031
- What about the rangers?
- Mm.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.695
Gone but not forgotten.

14:29.603 --> 14:31.970
As long as Simcoe
still lives, they can return.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.939
- Cooke wouldn't allow it.
- As long as he still lives.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.340
Do you think Simcoe would try something?

14:36.365 --> 14:37.188
You don't?

14:37.266 --> 14:40.178
Wait. You don't want to leave?

14:40.280 --> 14:44.183
Well, we discussed it, but when the
latest "Gazette" came, it was a comfort.

14:46.820 --> 14:49.302
Listen, if they knew about
Culper, I'd be on the masthead.

14:49.355 --> 14:50.921
They snatched some
poor fellow from Coram

14:51.023 --> 14:53.226
just south of here, but not me.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.527
- That means they don't know.
- He knows.

14:56.629 --> 14:58.429
Well, yeah, he knew
when he was a king's man.

14:58.531 --> 15:01.766
- And he ain't one now?
- He's sitting right here!

15:01.868 --> 15:03.926
And no, he is no longer a king's man.

15:04.653 --> 15:07.120
Not after the repeated
violations of common law

15:07.223 --> 15:11.377
and common decency by those
who <i> claim</i> to serve the Crown.

15:11.426 --> 15:14.060
Well, about time.

15:14.222 --> 15:17.156
All right, all right, listen. It's
better this way than the other.

15:17.466 --> 15:18.765
But we have a way to strike back,

15:18.868 --> 15:20.834
right here, in Setauket.

15:20.936 --> 15:22.202
What do you got?

15:26.607 --> 15:28.974
They're stockpiling hay at the fort.

15:29.076 --> 15:31.844
Three hundred tons of it,
straight from local farms,

15:31.946 --> 15:33.749
and due to be shipped
to York City on Monday.

15:33.851 --> 15:37.232
Now, that is enough to fuel
the entire British Army

15:37.257 --> 15:38.496
through the winter, I reckon.

15:38.598 --> 15:41.420
Three hundred tons? Jesus.

15:42.160 --> 15:43.626
That's too much to steal.

15:43.728 --> 15:47.163
And too much to burn.

15:47.265 --> 15:49.048
No, it ain't.

15:49.834 --> 15:51.501
No, it ain't.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.853
- Did you say Monday?
- Mm-hmm.

15:54.832 --> 15:55.998
Well, I go...

15:56.100 --> 15:59.435
camp, get lads, come back...

15:59.537 --> 16:00.669
No, it would be Tuesday.

16:03.298 --> 16:04.630
Can you delay the shipment?

16:05.433 --> 16:07.957
- What, can I?
- No, he can't.

16:08.075 --> 16:10.831
No, for one day. For half a day even.

16:10.991 --> 16:12.490
- I...
- It'll be all I need.

16:12.773 --> 16:13.671
<i>It could be done.</i>

16:15.615 --> 16:18.498
The officers, they move much slower
after a night of heavy drinking.

16:19.244 --> 16:21.278
Such as banquet thrown in their honor.

16:23.815 --> 16:24.648
Get going.

16:26.084 --> 16:27.918
Your mother's very clever.

16:30.856 --> 16:32.289
<i>Yow!</i>

17:16.627 --> 17:18.862
<i>May I take your coat, sir?</i>

17:21.433 --> 17:24.166
Peggy. Peggy!

17:24.269 --> 17:27.122
- Hello, dear. I've missed you so.
- Hi.

17:27.146 --> 17:29.615
- Becky, oh, you look beautiful.
- You do.

17:29.717 --> 17:31.683
No, look at you. Look at that dress.

17:31.785 --> 17:34.353
My love, this is Rebecca
Franks and Freddy Morgan,

17:34.455 --> 17:36.321
dear friends from Philadelphia.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.323
And this is my husband, General Arnold.

17:38.425 --> 17:40.792
General Arnold, how do you do?

17:40.894 --> 17:42.468
General, an honor.

17:42.570 --> 17:44.096
And you have many dear friends here,

17:44.198 --> 17:46.531
madam, eager to make your acquaintance.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.648
How do you do it, general?

18:13.885 --> 18:16.352
Colonel Cooke. Good to see you.

18:16.454 --> 18:17.854
General Arnold.

18:18.990 --> 18:20.723
We met at your office.

18:21.652 --> 18:23.845
Right, right. Beg pardon, general.

18:23.969 --> 18:25.001
I have to take a slash.

18:42.654 --> 18:46.489
My apologies, sir, but have you
had a chance to see Sir Clinton?

18:47.209 --> 18:48.876
I just lost another hand to him.

18:48.978 --> 18:51.745
In his study, in a closed game.

18:51.847 --> 18:54.381
Senior officers only.

18:54.483 --> 18:56.817
I'm sure <i> he</i> doesn't wish
to be disturbed.

18:56.919 --> 18:58.485
Yes, of course.

18:59.107 --> 19:01.274
It's only that as we discussed

19:01.376 --> 19:02.942
I have been commissioned
to raise regiment,

19:03.045 --> 19:04.677
but haven't granted the funds
for the recruitment.

19:04.780 --> 19:06.992
Have General Clinton sign the order

19:07.094 --> 19:10.183
and my office will release the money.

19:10.285 --> 19:13.247
That's just the problem, I can't
seem to schedule a meeting with him.

19:13.441 --> 19:15.308
I was hoping you would put in a word.

19:15.410 --> 19:17.777
Do you know if he's read of
my exploits in the "Gazette"?

19:17.879 --> 19:20.980
Ah, yes, the Spy Catcher General.

19:21.082 --> 19:23.082
Scourge of farmers
and tailors everywhere.

19:23.184 --> 19:26.266
Not farmers, spies!
Traitors to the Crown.

19:26.353 --> 19:27.853
You know, you might be
on to something there.

19:27.955 --> 19:29.555
We haven't been able to find
a new head of Intelligence

19:29.657 --> 19:31.590
since poor Major André fell.

19:31.692 --> 19:33.325
Perhaps a spy hunter
is exactly who we need.

19:33.427 --> 19:35.994
With all due respect, colonel,
I am a veteran of the field.

19:36.096 --> 19:38.197
I do not seek an administrative post

19:38.299 --> 19:39.831
like some invalid or coward.

19:40.849 --> 19:43.735
I hold an administrative post, sir.

19:45.940 --> 19:48.440
With all due respect.

19:54.991 --> 19:57.225
- That's her?
- Becky, please.

19:57.327 --> 19:59.561
<i> Freddy didn't want to upset
you, but I knew you'd want to know.</i>

19:59.663 --> 20:02.797
Of course I didn't want to upset her.

20:03.468 --> 20:04.766
I'm not upset.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.911
Major Dundas, pardon my intrusion,

20:13.013 --> 20:14.145
but I promised to introduce you

20:14.247 --> 20:15.680
to my dear friend from Philadelphia.

20:15.782 --> 20:18.516
Mrs. Margaret Shippen.

20:18.618 --> 20:21.786
<i>Arnold. Forgive me, Arnold.</i>

20:21.888 --> 20:24.055
Welcome to New York, Mrs. Arnold.

20:24.157 --> 20:25.356
Thank you, major.

20:25.459 --> 20:27.088
Oh, and may I have the honor

20:27.190 --> 20:30.062
to present Miss Philomena Cheer.

20:30.262 --> 20:32.595
Renowned actress of the New York stage.

20:32.697 --> 20:35.031
Miss Cheer, the famed actress.

20:35.133 --> 20:37.400
Truly your reputation precedes you.

20:37.502 --> 20:39.636
As does yours, Mrs. Arnold.

20:39.738 --> 20:42.005
Peggy, please. Call me, Peggy.

20:42.107 --> 20:45.108
You know I admire your craft
so, so much.

20:45.210 --> 20:49.572
To be an actress, and a truly
great one such as yourself,

20:49.982 --> 20:51.449
you have to become the women you portray

20:51.551 --> 20:53.617
even though you know
you're nothing like them.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.420
And then, once you've created
the illusion of them

20:56.522 --> 20:59.356
through costume, through hairstyle,

20:59.459 --> 21:01.325
you have to create feelings
out of thin air.

21:01.427 --> 21:04.130
Fear, anger, love.

21:04.463 --> 21:06.863
And then convince your
audience that those feelings

21:06.965 --> 21:09.866
are, in fact, real when we
know quite well they are not.

21:09.968 --> 21:12.102
I could never do what you do.

21:13.872 --> 21:16.072
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

21:17.989 --> 21:19.855
Would you excuse me?

21:43.928 --> 21:46.461
<i>Along with the hay, they
got dry goods and weapons.</i>

21:46.564 --> 21:48.463
And they're all due for export
to the city.

21:48.566 --> 21:51.533
According to Culper, who is now verified
secure, the boat arrives Monday.

21:51.635 --> 21:53.569
I reckon with 40 or 50 men,

21:53.671 --> 21:56.515
we could demolish the stockpile
and the fortress.

21:58.008 --> 22:00.142
But you require my permission,

22:00.244 --> 22:02.754
unlike your last raid in Setauket.

22:04.757 --> 22:05.889
Yes, sir.

22:05.991 --> 22:07.927
Why 50? Why not more?

22:11.897 --> 22:15.778
Well, Culper... they said they ain't got
no cannon at the fort, sir, only muskets.

22:15.803 --> 22:17.536
Sir, do you think that
we should not risk this action

22:17.638 --> 22:19.605
or do you not trust me to lead it?

22:19.707 --> 22:21.274
How did you wait before showing me

22:21.376 --> 22:23.056
this letter from General Arnold?

22:23.143 --> 22:26.077
One day, sir. And only that
because I gave it no regard.

22:26.179 --> 22:28.513
I never once gave him cause
to think me a defector.

22:28.615 --> 22:31.850
I'm as disgusted by the
insinuation as you must be.

22:39.911 --> 22:42.889
The hay in Setauket
is of so much consequence

22:42.914 --> 22:45.014
that the attempt must be made.

22:45.116 --> 22:48.818
Colonel Sheldon will furnish
you with a detachment.

22:49.226 --> 22:50.649
And I commit to you

22:50.674 --> 22:53.441
the execution of this order, major.

22:57.352 --> 22:59.386
We won't fail you, sir.

23:08.895 --> 23:13.164
Sedition? The only seditious sentiments
Mr. Mulligan ever made to me

23:13.266 --> 23:15.033
were those encouraging defection

23:15.135 --> 23:16.901
from my beloved barnyard.

23:17.003 --> 23:19.170
I reminded him this was a holy...

23:19.272 --> 23:21.105
My inquiry is not a joke, sir.

23:21.208 --> 23:23.942
No, it's very important.
It's very necessary.

23:24.044 --> 23:25.877
Do you know who
you should be investigating?

23:25.979 --> 23:30.760
Hugh Gaine. The man is a secret
patriot, everyone knows it.

23:30.794 --> 23:34.169
I am convinced he is sending
secret messages to the rebels

23:34.194 --> 23:35.627
<i>through that unreadable tabloid.</i>

23:35.729 --> 23:38.129
<i>Lieutenant Colonel John Graves Simcoe.</i>

23:38.231 --> 23:41.900
I'm the commander of his
Majesty's Queen's Rangers.

23:42.002 --> 23:45.270
I see that. No militia.

23:45.372 --> 23:48.807
Provincial forces, not militia.

23:48.909 --> 23:53.745
Sorry, sir, only commissioned
officers or sponsored guests.

23:53.847 --> 23:57.582
The barman knows me, I rescued
his life last Thanksgiving.

23:57.684 --> 24:00.376
Hello, friend. Good Quaker fellow.

24:00.479 --> 24:02.819
You know this man, Mr. Townsend?

24:03.013 --> 24:05.113
Yes, Tommy, I do.

24:05.215 --> 24:07.682
Welcome to Rivington's, Colonel Simcoe.

24:07.784 --> 24:09.918
Thank you, Townsend.
How does your father?

24:10.020 --> 24:12.851
In poor health, I'm afraid.
May I show you to a table?

24:14.624 --> 24:16.624
Ah, Townsley, I was just
coming to inquire of you.

24:16.727 --> 24:17.959
- Do you have a moment...
- Oh, I...

24:18.061 --> 24:19.861
- ...or am I interrupting?
- Not at all.

24:19.963 --> 24:23.556
Lieutenant Colonel John Graves
Simcoe, Queen's Rangers.

24:23.650 --> 24:25.850
General Benedict Arnold,
American Legion.

24:25.952 --> 24:28.486
Yes, I'm a great admirer of
your field tactics, general.

24:28.588 --> 24:31.022
Oh, really? Well, pray
then, won't you join us?

24:31.124 --> 24:34.258
That is, if you don't find talk of
snakes and spies too distasteful.

24:36.553 --> 24:38.453
Mr. Mulligan comes in
two or three times a week

24:38.555 --> 24:41.423
to have a drink or to have something
printed in the "Gazette."

24:41.525 --> 24:43.625
He is a loyal customer.

24:43.727 --> 24:47.319
Loyal, yes. But to whom?

24:49.560 --> 24:54.229
I had heard some gossip of some
Whiggish leanings before the war.

24:54.331 --> 24:56.331
- <i>And?</i>
- It was just that.

24:56.433 --> 24:57.599
Gossip.

24:57.701 --> 24:59.968
Which the good Lord
counsels us to ignore.

25:00.070 --> 25:03.171
Yes, of course. Gossip is a sin.

25:03.273 --> 25:05.607
And is also the tool of a spy.

25:05.709 --> 25:06.952
<i>I would imagine that this coffee shop</i>

25:06.977 --> 25:08.245
<i>would be the perfect place</i>

25:08.270 --> 25:09.978
<i>to spy upon military officers.</i>

25:10.080 --> 25:13.278
<i>Perhaps that was the reason
behind his frequent visits.</i>

25:13.784 --> 25:16.385
I hadn't considered that.

25:17.549 --> 25:21.717
But Mr. Mulligan was never here long
enough to engage in any such activity.

25:21.820 --> 25:24.487
It was always just
one drink and gone, really.

25:24.589 --> 25:26.322
He always seemed to me a very busy man.

25:27.725 --> 25:30.228
Busy with his shop on Queen Street.

25:31.329 --> 25:33.196
But anything is possible, I suppose.

25:33.298 --> 25:36.265
Everything is possible.

25:36.367 --> 25:37.834
Thank you, Townsends.

25:37.936 --> 25:40.239
You are quite welcome, sirs.

25:41.774 --> 25:44.407
If you will excuse me.

26:42.153 --> 26:43.386
Yep.

26:43.488 --> 26:45.571
What do you suppose them two gob about?

26:46.458 --> 26:48.124
<i>God knows.</i>

26:48.226 --> 26:50.526
but that's the girl who brought
poor André his redcoat

26:50.629 --> 26:52.962
so he could hang in it.

26:53.064 --> 26:54.764
André?

26:54.866 --> 26:56.332
Didn't see him hanged,

26:56.434 --> 27:00.051
but I did see him hung,
if you catch my meaning, eh?

27:01.452 --> 27:03.753
Come on, you grass widow.
Give a titter for that one.

27:03.855 --> 27:06.555
Cheeky.

27:06.657 --> 27:09.592
- York City?
- I need to earn a wage.

27:09.694 --> 27:12.194
A little more if I ever
hope to get to Canada.

27:12.931 --> 27:15.264
That's not gonna happen here.

27:15.881 --> 27:17.199
You've decided then?

27:18.170 --> 27:20.803
Cicero's at that age where
he's talking about joining up.

27:20.905 --> 27:24.373
Soldiering, like he saw Akinbode do.

27:25.479 --> 27:27.179
I can't risk losing him, too.

27:27.281 --> 27:30.716
Abby, you don't know
that Akinbode is lost.

27:30.818 --> 27:33.318
He said he'll come back
for you, he still could.

27:35.220 --> 27:37.454
Even if he did,
he wouldn't look for me here.

27:40.392 --> 27:42.158
You still have that pass
from the British

27:42.260 --> 27:43.827
to enter the city?

27:48.363 --> 27:50.930
- Anna...
- No, don't say it.

27:51.032 --> 27:52.263
There's no need.

27:53.620 --> 27:56.903
You've taken great risks
for us, for the cause.

27:57.464 --> 27:59.631
And like you said,
you can't take anymore.

28:43.121 --> 28:45.222
Mrs. Arnold?

29:12.176 --> 29:14.944
Hey. Is Abigail in?

29:15.046 --> 29:17.480
- Who?
- Major André's girl.

29:17.582 --> 29:20.483
- Runs the house.
- André? He's dead.

29:20.585 --> 29:22.618
This is General Arnold's house,

29:22.720 --> 29:24.587
but he ain't home and we all hired up.

29:24.729 --> 29:28.258
Wait, wait. You don't know
Abigail or the boy, Cicero?

29:28.485 --> 29:30.925
Who's asking? Mountain Joe?

29:34.157 --> 29:35.823
King George.

29:40.671 --> 29:43.279
You want your gal back, you gotta
cross the river to the rebel side.

29:43.381 --> 29:46.749
They sent her with a pass to help
clean up her boss for the rope.

29:46.851 --> 29:48.885
Took the boy with her.

29:48.987 --> 29:51.857
A pass? So, she'll be back?

29:52.591 --> 29:55.527
I absconded from Mount Vernon
in Virginia.

29:56.127 --> 29:59.354
Old man Washington
not letting no negroes go,

29:59.456 --> 30:01.464
pass or no pass.

30:03.234 --> 30:05.203
Don't come around here again.

30:26.386 --> 30:28.520
Ah, this is the place.

30:28.622 --> 30:30.388
<i>They're aren't near
the quality of Habersham's,</i>

30:30.490 --> 30:32.490
<i>but there are some good pieces.</i>

30:32.592 --> 30:34.225
- This one in particular...
- Peggy?

30:36.163 --> 30:38.336
Peggy, it's so good to see you!

30:38.383 --> 30:41.106
- Miss Cheer.
- Oh, Philomena, please.

30:41.320 --> 30:43.920
I do hope we can be friends.

30:44.022 --> 30:46.022
After I apologize, of course.

30:46.124 --> 30:49.703
- Peggy, this is the shop I wanted to...
- In a moment, Freddy.

30:49.748 --> 30:51.080
Apologize?

30:51.402 --> 30:52.896
Well, yes, for my behavior last night.

30:54.284 --> 30:56.017
I thought it improper to correct someone

30:56.119 --> 30:58.820
paying me such a gracious compliment,

30:58.922 --> 31:01.223
so I excused myself quickly,

31:01.325 --> 31:02.757
which was even more improper,

31:02.860 --> 31:04.659
- so I...
- Not at all.

31:04.761 --> 31:08.697
I wasn't offended, and if I gave
offense, I surely wasn't aware.

31:08.799 --> 31:10.992
This is what I came to realize.

31:11.453 --> 31:13.853
Though I am curious

31:13.955 --> 31:15.488
as to the correction you speak of.

31:15.590 --> 31:18.458
If only to avoid such
impropriety in the future.

31:19.994 --> 31:21.894
Just this.

31:22.781 --> 31:26.151
After much applause and many encores,

31:26.919 --> 31:29.453
John testified that in portraying you,

31:29.555 --> 31:32.623
I, in fact, outshined the original.

31:32.725 --> 31:34.358
Perhaps that's because
I chose to play you

31:34.460 --> 31:36.159
as the woman you might become,

31:37.061 --> 31:38.960
rather than the fumbling child he knew.

31:40.204 --> 31:42.171
Apart from that,
you're absolutely right.

31:43.747 --> 31:46.548
You could <i> never</i> do what I do.

31:47.871 --> 31:49.374
Good day.

32:02.252 --> 32:03.719
Halt.

32:03.821 --> 32:05.687
Just here is good, Mr. Woodhull.

32:16.634 --> 32:18.900
Mr. Woodhull.

32:19.003 --> 32:21.470
Welcome to Fort St. George.

32:22.367 --> 32:24.867
- Is your father well?
- Ah, he's well enough, yeah.

32:24.969 --> 32:26.936
Just likes me to run
his errands for now.

32:27.038 --> 32:28.554
The reimbursement for the farmers?

32:28.579 --> 32:30.615
- Yes
- I have it right here.

32:32.506 --> 32:34.840
That's a lot of hay.

32:34.942 --> 32:37.276
A lot of wagons in York City,

32:37.378 --> 32:38.877
and they all need pulling.

32:38.980 --> 32:42.147
Ah, here we are. Thank you, Appleton.

32:42.249 --> 32:43.916
Sir. Mr. Woodhull.

32:45.370 --> 32:46.798
Thank you, captain.

32:48.457 --> 32:51.481
Now, if you'd permit me, I'd like
to host you and your officers

32:51.583 --> 32:52.948
at Whitehall tomorrow night.

32:53.543 --> 32:55.376
Since I'll be handling more
of my father's business,

32:55.479 --> 32:57.312
I should like us better acquainted.

32:57.414 --> 32:58.847
We'd be honored, Abraham. Thank you.

32:58.949 --> 33:01.249
Oh, and since you'll be handling more,

33:01.351 --> 33:03.384
this is for your father.

33:04.488 --> 33:06.788
Compliments of Colonel Cooke.

33:09.613 --> 33:10.879
Well, half now and half

33:10.981 --> 33:13.145
when the pork reaches the city.

33:15.318 --> 33:19.387
Oh, yeah, well,
he'll be happy to hear it.

33:21.124 --> 33:23.725
No wonder you didn't want
this raid to come up.

33:23.827 --> 33:26.872
How much more you think you can
get for selling out my friends?

33:30.468 --> 33:32.067
If I told Wakefield about your friends,

33:32.169 --> 33:33.569
I'd be turning you in as well.

33:33.671 --> 33:35.510
- You know I won't do that.
- Oh, why not?

33:35.547 --> 33:36.746
You did it before.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.581
And you're still in bed with Cooke!

33:38.684 --> 33:40.383
I am gouging Cooke.

33:40.485 --> 33:42.519
I'm charging him three times
the going rate so his officers

33:42.621 --> 33:45.388
can eat ham this winter,
and I'm doing it for you.

33:45.490 --> 33:46.956
This is the deed to Whitehall,

33:47.059 --> 33:48.558
which I have now signed over to you.

33:48.660 --> 33:50.833
If you want this to be worth
anything at the end of this...

33:50.935 --> 33:52.918
I told you, I don't
care about your money.

33:53.020 --> 33:55.379
No? What do you care about?

33:55.500 --> 33:57.867
Our family. Our country.

33:57.969 --> 33:59.268
- And this town.
- Oh, this town.

33:59.370 --> 34:01.270
Yes, and I'm sick of seeing it bled dry

34:01.372 --> 34:03.277
- by these leeches!
- If you burn that hay

34:03.317 --> 34:04.349
before the farmers are paid for it,

34:04.451 --> 34:06.551
they will bleed and starve!

34:06.654 --> 34:08.353
Oh, no, no, no.

34:08.455 --> 34:12.324
No, they won't starve. King's promise.

34:12.426 --> 34:14.192
It's all right here in writing.

34:14.295 --> 34:16.128
You know they would never be paid.

34:16.230 --> 34:17.629
That's why you let
their crops be destroyed

34:17.731 --> 34:19.623
so you could paint Simcoe as a madman.

34:19.725 --> 34:22.600
Simcoe is a madman. Wakefield
is just doing his duty.

34:22.629 --> 34:24.770
As are his men who
you would have slaughtered.

34:24.813 --> 34:25.771
Slaughtered?

34:27.665 --> 34:29.942
They're not sheep, they're soldiers.

34:30.534 --> 34:31.842
And they're on the wrong side.

34:34.139 --> 34:35.373
You're in the war now, Father.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.775
This is how it's done.

34:51.393 --> 34:53.745
<i>So, we land at Old Man's
and then we march inland?</i>

34:53.847 --> 34:56.355
Mm-hmm. It's the only place
to hide that many boats.

34:57.070 --> 34:59.137
Aye, but the field here,
it's too open for us

34:59.239 --> 35:00.872
to advance with any surprise.

35:00.974 --> 35:03.841
The closest we can get
is here, the tree line, right?

35:03.944 --> 35:05.843
- Right.
- Then it's up to you and your pioneers

35:05.946 --> 35:08.642
- to cross the field and break the gate.
- <i>Yep.</i>

35:08.667 --> 35:10.014
You can get closer than that.

35:10.541 --> 35:12.385
- What, where?
- Here.

35:12.510 --> 35:14.336
- Anna, there's no cover there.
- <i>Yes, there is.</i>

35:14.438 --> 35:16.145
There's brush along the shore
and an incline to conceal you.

35:16.247 --> 35:18.214
- No, there isn't.
- Yes, there is.

35:18.316 --> 35:20.650
- I don't remember that.
- Well, you didn't live there, did you?

35:21.479 --> 35:23.045
Ooh, careful, you two.

35:23.147 --> 35:25.081
Keep fighting like that,

35:25.183 --> 35:27.216
- folks will say you're in love.
- Caleb, enough.

35:27.318 --> 35:28.693
No, he's right.

35:29.821 --> 35:32.826
People are already talking.
At least the doxies are.

35:32.928 --> 35:34.523
And who can blame them?

35:34.625 --> 35:36.325
I'm allowed further into camp
than they are.

35:36.427 --> 35:37.593
And I'm in this tent

35:37.695 --> 35:41.325
long enough for...
well, for women to talk.

35:41.427 --> 35:43.188
Well, I'll speak to them.
I'll put an end to that.

35:43.213 --> 35:44.466
<i> Don't, please.</i>

35:44.769 --> 35:46.902
As long as they think I'm...

35:48.446 --> 35:50.947
That we are...

35:53.185 --> 35:56.119
- Knocking?
- Then they won't dig any deeper.

35:56.221 --> 35:58.421
You think there are spies
among the camp followers?

35:58.523 --> 36:00.456
More like I don't trust them
to keep secrets.

36:00.559 --> 36:02.559
I don't want them to think
I'm working for the ring.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.394
- That we even have a ring.
- So, what are you asking me to do?

36:04.496 --> 36:07.230
Nothing, just let them
believe their gossip.

36:10.965 --> 36:12.771
All right.

36:13.234 --> 36:14.633
Can we get back to the raid?

36:14.735 --> 36:16.502
Ah, yes, let's.

36:16.604 --> 36:19.171
- Can I joke about this later, though?
- No.

36:27.886 --> 36:29.352
Sorry I missed supper.

36:29.454 --> 36:30.854
I had to make an inspection
at Bridewell Prison,

36:30.956 --> 36:32.890
where we'll be housing some guests.

36:33.492 --> 36:35.792
That's all right, dear. I know
you've been hard at work.

36:35.894 --> 36:40.196
This is Freddy Morgan. You remember
meeting him at Kennedy House?

36:40.299 --> 36:42.799
<i>I know it's late,
but I expected you earlier,</i>

36:42.901 --> 36:47.837
and, well, Freddy has something very
important to tell you about someone.

36:48.586 --> 36:50.420
<i>He's read your mention in the "Gazette."</i>

36:50.908 --> 36:54.090
And... Well, Freddy?

36:54.192 --> 36:55.591
General, sir,

36:55.694 --> 36:59.662
I'm a coiffeur, or a <i> friseur...</i>

36:59.764 --> 37:01.898
hairdresser if you like.

37:02.689 --> 37:04.489
And I have plied this trade

37:04.591 --> 37:06.591
<i>both in Philadelphia
and now in New York,</i>

37:06.693 --> 37:07.825
<i>where I took on a client</i>

37:07.927 --> 37:09.627
by the name of Philomena Cheer.

37:09.729 --> 37:11.829
An actress.

37:12.884 --> 37:14.150
And...

37:15.509 --> 37:17.676
And while I was arranging her high roll,

37:17.778 --> 37:19.678
I heard her say many a thing,

37:19.780 --> 37:21.780
which was, well...

37:22.340 --> 37:24.683
treasonous, sir.

37:25.564 --> 37:27.631
And I came to believe her a spy.

37:31.445 --> 37:33.813
She's been seen on the arm
of several bachelor officers.

37:33.915 --> 37:36.148
And so we believe she may be
seducing them for secrets,

37:36.250 --> 37:38.689
which she then passes on
to her rebel masters.

37:39.691 --> 37:42.888
A woman spy amongst the officers?

37:43.661 --> 37:45.862
- Who would suspect?
- Indeed.

37:52.710 --> 37:54.843
- Miss Philomena Cheer?
- Yes.

37:56.550 --> 37:59.017
- Come with us.
- What's this?

38:00.854 --> 38:04.589
- Are you having some sort of laugh?
- No.

38:04.691 --> 38:06.024
What are you doing?

38:06.126 --> 38:08.093
- Stop. Unhand me!
- What are you doing?

38:08.195 --> 38:10.095
You're tearing her!

38:26.712 --> 38:30.281
- More wine, gentlemen?
- Hmm, no, no.

38:30.383 --> 38:32.349
- I couldn't possibly.
- Ah, you could, you could,

38:32.452 --> 38:35.386
and you should. I've been saving this
for a special occasion.

38:36.146 --> 38:39.447
Honestly, too much wine and I
can't be woken the next morning.

38:39.549 --> 38:42.083
Not even with fife and drum
right outside his door.

38:42.185 --> 38:45.125
We have to fire off a cannon.

38:45.172 --> 38:47.105
Excellent meal, madam. Very satisfying.

38:47.207 --> 38:49.007
Thank you, captain,
there's more on the way.

38:49.109 --> 38:50.909
Oh, we are stuffed, but thank you.

38:51.011 --> 38:51.910
Perhaps your father wants some,

38:52.012 --> 38:53.311
he's hardly eaten.

38:53.413 --> 38:55.113
- Not feeling well.
- What about dessert?

38:55.215 --> 38:57.048
- I baked a custard pie.
- Oh, you have to try that.

38:57.150 --> 38:59.117
It's her specialty, you have to.

38:59.219 --> 39:02.487
Ah, custard and brandy.

39:03.232 --> 39:04.698
Warms you right up, and heaven knows

39:04.800 --> 39:06.267
- it's cold outside.
- Oh, it's frigid.

39:06.369 --> 39:07.801
Well, maybe just one spoon.

39:07.904 --> 39:09.770
Judge, there's some gentlemen
here to see you.

39:09.872 --> 39:11.138
Who is...

39:11.240 --> 39:12.673
Oh, heaven blast!

39:15.590 --> 39:16.777
What day is to...

39:16.879 --> 39:18.846
this is why I ask to be informed

39:18.948 --> 39:21.226
should you decide to host guests.

39:21.586 --> 39:22.952
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

39:23.055 --> 39:24.621
Sorry, Richard, but it's cold out there,

39:24.723 --> 39:26.823
and we heard something... oh.

39:28.894 --> 39:30.226
Hello.

39:30.328 --> 39:32.062
- Is this...
- A mistake.

39:32.164 --> 39:34.464
I quite forgot that tonight was
the night for our discussion.

39:34.566 --> 39:36.032
I'm afraid I don't have enough
prepared for all...

39:36.134 --> 39:39.439
Oh, that's all right,
we only expected warm cider.

39:39.464 --> 39:42.647
Oh, cider? We can do cider.

39:42.787 --> 39:44.019
Can we? We can do cider, yeah.

39:44.121 --> 39:46.555
- We really must be going.
- Going?

39:46.657 --> 39:48.557
I thought we'd toast to his majesty

39:48.659 --> 39:52.094
- now that we're all...
- Martin, this was a mistake.

39:52.196 --> 39:54.830
<i>I had meant to have a
separate meeting with you all</i>

39:54.932 --> 39:56.966
concerning the army's reimbursement.

39:57.549 --> 39:59.782
You mean the reimbursement
we're collecting tonight?

39:59.884 --> 40:02.585
That's what I hoped
to speak to you about.

40:02.687 --> 40:06.222
- We'll leave you to your business.
- Our business.

40:06.324 --> 40:07.156
Our business, captain.

40:07.258 --> 40:08.357
You speak to the magistrate,

40:08.460 --> 40:10.526
we must prepare for a shipment tomorrow.

40:10.628 --> 40:12.361
- The shipment's tomorrow?
- No, no.

40:12.464 --> 40:15.455
It can't be tomorrow
because we are not paid yet.

40:15.503 --> 40:18.437
<i>And it was made very clear
that we should be paid</i>

40:18.539 --> 40:19.638
before the shipment leaves!

40:19.740 --> 40:21.173
- Just wait.
- Wait?

40:21.275 --> 40:23.776
We have waited. We have waited too long.

40:23.878 --> 40:25.077
You'll have to wait a little longer

40:25.179 --> 40:27.079
as I must wait for a stipend
from New York

40:27.181 --> 40:28.514
in order to pay you.

40:28.616 --> 40:30.950
- We can't wait!
- Don't take that tone!

40:31.052 --> 40:33.785
- Gentlemen, please.
- We will block the road

40:33.887 --> 40:35.820
with our wagons, we will block it.

40:35.867 --> 40:38.467
Any man who approaches
that fort will be shot!

40:38.569 --> 40:42.138
Captain, these men are loyal Tories.

40:42.240 --> 40:44.206
- Their crops feed your army.
-<i> Ja.</i>

40:44.308 --> 40:46.877
And their army protect you
from the rebel horde.

40:47.745 --> 40:50.780
Of course, we remember
the abuses of Colonel Simcoe,

40:50.882 --> 40:53.117
and we respect the man
who stood against him.

40:54.886 --> 40:56.152
In the spirit of that respect

40:56.254 --> 40:57.787
I suggest that we adjourn for the night

40:57.889 --> 40:59.789
and have a proper sit tomorrow morning.

40:59.891 --> 41:01.857
<i>No one will approach the fort.</i>

41:01.959 --> 41:03.859
<i>We will have it at the tavern.</i>

41:03.961 --> 41:07.932
We will come to you and resolve
the matter of recompense.

41:08.733 --> 41:11.767
I'm sure the hay can wait
while we sort it out.

41:12.570 --> 41:15.444
I can spare you the morning,
but not the day.

41:15.546 --> 41:18.774
We will honor a discussion.
I am not... Simcoe.

41:18.876 --> 41:21.644
And for that, we are grateful, captain.

41:22.438 --> 41:23.779
Tomorrow then.

41:25.516 --> 41:26.348
Excuse me.

41:27.951 --> 41:29.051
Tomorrow.

41:54.444 --> 41:56.678
<i>First, there are the hay collectors,</i>

41:56.780 --> 41:58.480
then the hay inspectors,
then the hay weighers.

41:58.582 --> 42:01.519
There are five clerks
for the work of one man.

42:02.586 --> 42:04.953
I do not make the law,
I mere enforce it.

42:05.055 --> 42:07.689
If I may speak to the law,

42:07.791 --> 42:10.168
the regulations are quite clear.

42:10.261 --> 42:12.495
<i>Section One, and I quote...</i>

42:17.869 --> 42:19.735
Anna was right.

42:22.407 --> 42:25.842
Tower's empty, break the gate.

42:25.944 --> 42:27.577
No, wait.

42:34.230 --> 42:35.329
Caleb!

42:56.771 --> 42:59.305
Charge! Charge!

43:05.012 --> 43:06.312
Give us quarter!

43:06.414 --> 43:07.480
Quarter!

43:09.508 --> 43:10.507
- Sit down.

43:22.466 --> 43:23.999
<i>Washington and glory!</i>

43:24.101 --> 43:25.767
Washington and glory!

43:25.869 --> 43:27.836
<i>Washington and glory!</i>

43:27.938 --> 43:29.865
Sergeant, take your men and
clear the house.

43:29.890 --> 43:30.820
Yes, sir.

43:30.898 --> 43:33.475
Pioneers, demolish the enemy's works.

43:33.577 --> 43:36.912
And the rest of you, burn the hay.
All of it.

43:37.014 --> 43:38.277
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

43:44.229 --> 43:46.796
What? Do you know
how much these are worth?

44:15.753 --> 44:19.088
"A promise to reimburse at a set price

44:19.190 --> 44:23.092
for regulation cords
of four feet, nine inches

44:23.194 --> 44:25.294
- within 30 days."
- There's a fire.

44:25.396 --> 44:28.065
On the fort. It's burning down!

44:50.322 --> 44:51.655
Bloody bastards!

44:51.757 --> 44:53.356
Why didn't you tell me about your plan?

44:53.459 --> 44:55.992
Because I was playing it against you.

44:58.597 --> 45:01.098
Well, you'll be pleased to
know I learned a thing or two.

45:01.200 --> 45:03.934
When the consequence
of today rears its head,

45:04.368 --> 45:06.503
then we'll know what we've learned.

45:36.572 --> 45:38.639
What are you doing out of bed?

45:38.741 --> 45:41.675
Wow, you startled me.

45:41.777 --> 45:43.377
Those are John André's.

45:44.554 --> 45:45.486
I'm to hand them off

45:45.589 --> 45:46.888
to the new head of intelligence,

45:46.990 --> 45:48.890
whenever they find
some idiot to fill that post.

45:50.280 --> 45:52.914
Well, I was so invigorated
to help you catch that spy,

45:52.939 --> 45:55.774
I found my curiosity fired up.

45:56.166 --> 45:58.132
It seems that John was on the hunt for

45:58.234 --> 46:01.169
a particular ring of spies who
report directly to Washington.

46:01.271 --> 46:05.379
Look here. They mention
a lady named 3-5-5.

46:05.481 --> 46:07.442
Perhaps that's Philomena Cheer.

46:10.868 --> 46:12.347
It's all guesswork.

46:13.037 --> 46:15.673
Informants, tipsters, cheats.

46:17.340 --> 46:18.505
"Tallmadge."

46:20.555 --> 46:22.989
These are Tallmadge's dogs.

46:23.091 --> 46:25.558
"7-2-3 man in New York.

46:26.217 --> 46:30.354
7-2-2 man on Long Island.
7-2-5 whaleboat courier."

46:32.857 --> 46:34.100
Whaleboat.

46:37.194 --> 46:38.905
I know who his courier is.

46:39.007 --> 46:40.339
You do?

46:41.062 --> 46:42.094
Brewster.

46:43.200 --> 46:45.736
His name is Brewster.
