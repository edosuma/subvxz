00:07.180 --> 00:12.370
If you talk about 30, 40 years,
then... Who knows?

00:12.410 --> 00:17.280
If you're talking about about ten years,
I think that it won't change very much.

00:17.320 --> 00:21.320
Good morning. Mr. Strauss-Kahn
speech will confront head on the problems

00:21.360 --> 00:26.380
that have decept the financial industry
since the meltdown in 2008.

00:27.170 --> 00:31.250
The speech is not expect
to be popular. Conservative politicians

00:31.290 --> 00:37.240
and many in the finance don't want the kind of change
that the IMF director has expected to propose.

01:24.260 --> 01:29.290
I rise before the sun and
I stare into the darkness.

01:37.190 --> 01:42.300
My body has been sleepy, but my mind has not.

02:06.170 --> 02:11.280
Although I cannot see the devil's face,
I know he can see mine.

02:14.170 --> 02:16.330
I can't hide.

02:19.170 --> 02:21.220
Game.
Lets replay the point.

02:21.260 --> 02:24.340
What are you talking about?
I don't like to win that way.

02:24.380 --> 02:29.230
Have I taught you nothing? Nobody cares how you win.
Besides, I'll kick your ass next time.

02:30.290 --> 02:32.270
Your mind wasn't on the game.

02:32.310 --> 02:36.390
Nina has taken Ed's suicide very hard.
You know how close she is to Claire and the kids.

02:37.180 --> 02:38.340
Claire didn't see this coming.

02:38.380 --> 02:42.210
Did anybody? I guess you never know
what demons were torturing him.

02:42.250 --> 02:46.330
Maybe it was because of the shame
of falsifying those records profits.

02:46.370 --> 02:50.340
What did you say?
All this time I thought it was us in trading who made big money

02:50.340 --> 02:53.010
covering for all the loss in Ed's department.

02:53.200 --> 02:58.330
You know what? I know you're upset,
but keep your suspicions to yourself.

02:58.330 --> 03:00.330
And keep them private.

03:35.340 --> 03:40.250
It is interesting to watch how the dollar
is affecting everything so differently.

03:40.290 --> 03:45.350
How's Carrie?
The doctors have induces a coma.

03:46.410 --> 03:51.180
I'm sorry. Truly. I wish you
would have told me she was back.

03:51.220 --> 03:54.360
I could have managed the news
with the board before they found out.

03:54.400 --> 03:58.190
They don't want me, the other guy
is dead and I still don't get it.

03:58.230 --> 04:02.260
We've been through this.
Tell me you'll stay.

04:02.300 --> 04:04.410
I owe you my career Dominic, you know that.

04:05.200 --> 04:11.260
But if I can't be vice-CEO
Not now. That's all. Not yet.

04:16.170 --> 04:21.320
I have to fly to Washington.
Let's talk about this when I get back.

04:26.220 --> 04:29.360
Black Ship Investments.
Li Acheng, please.

04:29.400 --> 04:32.200
One moment.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.320
I'm sorry, Mr. Acheng is busy at the moment.

04:38.360 --> 04:41.260
I know he's busy, tell him Massimo Ruggero called.

04:41.300 --> 04:44.240
Yes, mr. Ruggero. Thank you.

04:46.250 --> 04:51.170
You used me. And one of your
colleague killed himself as a result.

04:52.300 --> 04:53.400
What are you talking about?

04:54.190 --> 04:59.180
Edward Stuart jumped to his death the day
that Davenport story went viral. A story you gave us.

04:59.220 --> 05:00.400
Listen to me. Listen to me!

05:01.190 --> 05:05.320
The board still promoted him to vice-CEO,
so that story has nothing to do with his death.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.290
So why did he jump?

05:10.270 --> 05:13.380
Ask his shrink.
I barely knew the guy.

05:19.250 --> 05:23.210
Do you know anyone at The Guardian?
I might.

05:23.250 --> 05:27.330
Good. Get in touch for me.
Get in touch for yourself

05:27.370 --> 05:31.260
You and your anarchist friends
want dirt on the evil bank, don't you?

05:31.300 --> 05:34.410
Why would you leak
informations about your own bank?

05:35.200 --> 05:36.410
Let me know.

05:54.300 --> 05:59.360
Do you think they'll talk to us about Davenport?
Why not shout a little louder so that anyone can hear?

06:15.410 --> 06:17.340
As part of their investigation

06:17.380 --> 06:22.220
the police will want to speak to some
of you about the tragic event.

06:22.260 --> 06:26.190
I know it's still raw for everyone,
but be nice.

06:26.230 --> 06:30.310
Chris is eyeing up Ed's office already.
Kate?

06:39.290 --> 06:41.300
What did Dominic say?
Not much.

06:41.340 --> 06:45.240
He's stalling.
The longer I stay, the weaker I look.

06:45.410 --> 06:50.230
We wish you could take us with you
I'm planning on it, Paul.

06:51.170 --> 06:53.380
We can't, we have non compete clauses.
I'll take care of it.

06:55.220 --> 06:58.280
If you are all with me.
Of course we are.

07:01.180 --> 07:03.360
Good. Thank you. Get back to work.

07:09.170 --> 07:13.300
People are saying Ed killed himself
because of Davenport. Because the shit we did.

07:13.340 --> 07:17.330
It wasn't exactly above board FCA friendly shit, was it?
Who made him drop 50 million...

07:17.370 --> 07:19.210
It's not about that.

07:19.250 --> 07:24.170
The bank's been covering his losses
all year calling them record profits.

07:24.210 --> 07:27.330
Did you read the papers?
So what tip him over the edge?

07:27.370 --> 07:30.380
I don't know Kalim, let me quickly go
search his office and I'll find out.

07:31.170 --> 07:33.270
You can't, the police is in there.
That was kind of my point.

07:33.280 --> 07:36.100
And if he was hiding something big
why would he keep it on his work computer?

07:36.110 --> 07:37.330
Kalim, stop talking.

07:38.340 --> 07:42.330
Massimo, wouldn't we look
kind of guilty if we left right now?

07:42.370 --> 07:45.180
Like running from the scene of a crime?

07:45.220 --> 07:50.250
All we did was expose a man's
illness that would have eventually come out anyway.

07:51.270 --> 07:54.270
It has become an expensive meeting.
Get back to work.

08:33.390 --> 08:37.260
Dominic?
Hi. I landed, I'm in D.C. now.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.280
How's Claire?

08:40.380 --> 08:43.330
In shock. She keeps bursting into tears.

08:43.370 --> 08:47.240
You are a good friend.
I'm sure this is hard on you.

08:47.280 --> 08:50.180
I know what it is to grief, that's all.

08:51.170 --> 08:54.390
This trip is badly timed. I need your help.
I don't see what I can do.

08:55.180 --> 09:00.370
Massimo trusts you.
Encourage him to confide in me.

09:00.410 --> 09:05.250
So you can manipulate him?
So I can keep him from making a mistake.

09:05.290 --> 09:08.400
Sometimes I almost believe you really care for Massimo.

09:09.190 --> 09:10.370
Of course I do.

09:12.200 --> 09:16.350
You don't really care for anyone, Dominic.
It's beyond your grasp.

09:17.340 --> 09:21.400
Aaron Swartz said "information is power."
But like all power,

09:22.190 --> 09:24.210
there're those who want to keep it for themselves.

09:24.250 --> 09:29.190
Why is it right to encourage the leaking
of secret information?

09:29.230 --> 09:34.410
You need yo ask yourself what sort of information is
important in the world today. What cause disruption?

09:35.200 --> 09:40.250
Think about the length that people
on the inside of certain organizations go to

09:40.290 --> 09:44.230
In order to conceal what they're doing.
These are the new gods. Really.

09:44.270 --> 09:50.230
Who need not to worry themselves
with little things like politics or democracy.

09:50.270 --> 09:52.260
Because they are up here.

09:53.300 --> 09:55.330
They are up here.

09:58.380 --> 10:01.190
They're making their own rules.

10:01.230 --> 10:03.360
Manipulating the social pyramid.

10:03.400 --> 10:08.410
And virtually killing the
future for the next generation.

10:09.370 --> 10:12.290
These are the new gods. Really.

10:13.380 --> 10:16.220
..killing the future for the next generation.

10:16.260 --> 10:19.300
Daniel, we've got to go!
Yeah, I'm coming.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.340
You'll have to be quick.
You are moving on?

10:25.350 --> 10:29.230
I came because I wanted to...
I know. I'm sorry.

10:29.270 --> 10:33.240
Is just that as soon as the
video hits they'll be all over me so..

10:34.250 --> 10:38.220
I'll make it up to you.
What is it?

10:39.260 --> 10:42.260
Massimo Ruggero wants me to put
him in touch with The Guardian.

10:42.300 --> 10:44.330
What's he got?
Dirt on NYL.

10:44.370 --> 10:47.310
He didn't say what kind,
but he made it sound bad.

10:47.350 --> 10:53.330
He'll have to tell us more than that.
He won't. This is his game, not ours.

10:55.380 --> 10:59.190
Why do I get the feeling
you want to help this guy?

10:59.380 --> 11:01.350
Don't be stupid.

11:01.390 --> 11:06.260
Daniel, we got to go!
Yeah, I'm coming.

11:09.250 --> 11:14.210
Crazy, isn't it? This city once
dominated the world.

11:19.190 --> 11:22.230
Get in touch with Hilary Mason, ok?

11:28.260 --> 11:32.340
Dominic said Carrie's in the hospital.
I spent the night at her bedside.

11:32.380 --> 11:36.330
I don't mean to you at worries, but you have to really watch yourself.

11:36.370 --> 11:39.310
Dominic thinks I'm gonna
hit back against the bank.

11:39.350 --> 11:44.230
He wants me to persuade
you to confide in him.

11:44.270 --> 11:47.220
Of course he does.
You know what they could do to you Massimo.

11:47.220 --> 11:49.260
Promise me you won't do anything stupid.

11:49.260 --> 11:55.190
Not in the way he thinks.
I need your help with something.

12:03.280 --> 12:05.270
Espresso, please.
Yes. Sure.

12:06.220 --> 12:10.170
You want coffee?
I'm alright.

12:10.410 --> 12:12.320
What happened?

12:15.290 --> 12:18.270
When professor Wade offered
a chance to work with you

12:18.310 --> 12:23.260
I thought this was the opportunity
I'd be waiting for all my life.

12:23.300 --> 12:24.380
Very good. And now?

12:25.340 --> 12:30.400
I want nothing more to do with you.
Cheating in the exams was one thing.

12:31.190 --> 12:33.350
But making a man kill himself...

12:36.330 --> 12:40.280
I didn't make Ed Stuart kill himself.

12:41.290 --> 12:48.220
I need you to help me prove that I
had nothing to do with his death.

12:48.260 --> 12:50.200
No, I'm done.

12:51.290 --> 12:54.290
Don't want to know why he really died?

13:08.380 --> 13:10.390
I need you to go to this address.

13:21.190 --> 13:23.260
Yes, Dominic Morgan. Thank you.

13:27.280 --> 13:32.230
I heard about Ed. I am so sorry.
Yes, thank you very much Margaret.

13:32.270 --> 13:35.380
So, did you get a hold of his speech?
I just finished reading it.

13:36.170 --> 13:38.340
I think we may have a problem.

13:38.380 --> 13:44.200
Globalization lifted hundreds
of millions of people out of poverty.

13:44.240 --> 13:51.380
But this globalization has a dark-side.
A chasm between rich and poor.

13:52.170 --> 13:55.250
The tendency was to downplay equality.
See what I mean?

13:55.290 --> 13:59.350
To see it as a necessary
evil on the road to riches.

13:59.390 --> 14:02.370
I didn't realized he was
a fucking communist.

14:02.410 --> 14:08.320
We need a new form of globalization
a fairer form of globalization.

14:08.360 --> 14:12.270
A globalization with a more human face.

14:12.310 --> 14:16.360
The monetary system has
rested on the strength of the dollar.

14:16.400 --> 14:21.250
Our idea is to lie on
a basket of currencies.

14:21.290 --> 14:26.310
Combining the dollar, yuan,
yen and above all the euro.

14:26.350 --> 14:30.300
That could guarantee an anchor, both stable
and independent free of the oscillations...

14:30.340 --> 14:37.190
Look at Becker, he's eating it up.
...of the currencies of our very one nation.

14:37.230 --> 14:43.190
Ask yourselves what
kind of world do you want to live in.

14:43.230 --> 14:46.330
Surely one more intelligent.

14:46.370 --> 14:52.180
More just. More virtuous than the old one.

14:53.250 --> 14:55.220
Thank you very much.

14:59.300 --> 15:01.410
They'll let anyone in to these things.

15:02.200 --> 15:07.210
Dominic. You know my colleagues from
Rheinthaler Bank. Nicklaus Lang and Karl Haufman.

15:07.250 --> 15:10.330
Gentlemen, may I steal you?
Yes, of course.

15:13.170 --> 15:20.170
I'm afraid Nina won't be able to join us tomorrow.
She need to stay close to Claire right now.

15:20.210 --> 15:24.320
Of course. We were shocked by the news,
Dominic. Just shocked.

15:26.180 --> 15:32.180
I noticed you were nodding your approval.
Well, you know... He's right.

15:32.220 --> 15:34.250
We've got to clean up the mess we've made.

15:34.290 --> 15:38.240
And the substitute currency
would be good for all of us.

15:39.190 --> 15:44.230
Doesn't it seem a bit.. radical?
Radical?

15:44.270 --> 15:48.230
No more radical than Nixon
dropping the gold standard in '71.

15:48.270 --> 15:50.220
Don't you think?

15:51.310 --> 15:53.380
I'll see you in Frankfurt.

15:58.280 --> 16:02.350
You heard Strauss-Kahn's speech.
What's our exposure on the dollar?

16:03.290 --> 16:05.210
Around 700 million, boss.

16:05.250 --> 16:08.270
Hedge the dollar and buy the euro up to 50%.

16:08.310 --> 16:11.400
Do it carefully over the next 15 days.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.150
Got it.

16:15.330 --> 16:21.410
What else are you up to, Massimo?
To taking care of our future.

16:21.420 --> 16:22.150
Good morning.

16:34.190 --> 16:38.280
Tom, what are you doing in there,
Get out now! Out!

16:42.270 --> 16:46.290
You have to keep the
children out of Ed's study!

16:46.330 --> 16:51.340
Mrs. Stuart?
Oliver. Wait here.

17:03.170 --> 17:05.220
You only have a couple of hours.

17:05.260 --> 17:10.410
You only have a few hours...
Massimo made that clear.

17:10.410 --> 17:14.410
Do you have any luck finding the password?
I guess not.

17:18.270 --> 17:21.319
You better take over
before I kill us all, Jack.

17:24.240 --> 17:28.400
Never thought I'd see this.
The great Massimo Ruggero.

17:29.190 --> 17:32.280
In my plane.
I appreciate your hospitality, Mr. Achang.

17:32.320 --> 17:34.330
But it is unnecessary. Thank you.

17:34.370 --> 17:38.230
I must admit I was surprised
to hear of your interest.

17:38.270 --> 17:41.190
Any bank would fall over
themselves to hire you.

17:41.230 --> 17:44.280
Black Ship is the second largest
hedge fund in the world.

17:44.320 --> 17:49.230
A hedge fund suits me fine.
I expect you'll make it worth my while.

17:49.400 --> 17:53.290
Men reach a point when they have more
money than they can spend.

17:54.320 --> 17:57.230
What they crave then is power.

17:58.400 --> 18:01.190
Who says I'm like other men?

18:38.370 --> 18:41.210
Oliver?
What am I looking for?

18:41.250 --> 18:46.220
I don't know. There must be something
on that.. Something Ed was working on.

18:46.260 --> 18:48.300
I've got to go.

19:00.390 --> 19:04.290
Had your husband been
under any particular stress lately?

19:06.360 --> 19:09.300
Things have been hard since
the crash a couple of years ago.

19:09.340 --> 19:13.390
But it was especially bad
in the past few weeks.

19:14.340 --> 19:16.210
Why especially bad?

19:16.350 --> 19:20.280
My husband was up for a promotion
that he wanted very badly.

19:20.320 --> 19:23.390
Was that because of his rivalry with...

19:24.180 --> 19:26.410
head of trading, Massimo Ruggero?

19:28.390 --> 19:31.290
Partly, I suppose.

19:32.230 --> 19:36.230
It's business.
I watched it eat way out him.

19:37.270 --> 19:39.410
We know this is a difficult time.

19:42.370 --> 19:46.180
What were you doing
at the office that day?

19:47.290 --> 19:51.340
He called me. Asked me to come.

19:52.330 --> 19:57.190
I presumed it was to toast his promotion.

19:57.230 --> 19:59.280
I suppose I'll never know.

20:00.280 --> 20:05.240
Did your husband have a PC
other than the one in his office at work?

20:09.340 --> 20:14.180
Anything that might help us
establish his state of mind.

20:16.320 --> 20:18.280
He has a laptop.

20:20.280 --> 20:23.170
I'll go get it.

20:25.290 --> 20:28.370
We haven't been able to reach out
your husband, mrs. Morgan.

20:28.410 --> 20:32.280
Dominic is on his way from
Washington to Germany.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.390
He should be back tomorrow night.

20:35.180 --> 20:39.230
Mr. Stuart's suicide must have
been a great shock to your husband.

20:39.270 --> 20:41.400
Of course. It was for everyone.

20:42.190 --> 20:47.240
I'm sorry. It should be here.
Maybe he left at in the office.

20:48.230 --> 20:50.240
Why don't you just sit down and I'll find it.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.240
Can you leave a number so we can contact you?

20:53.320 --> 20:54.410
Of course.

21:00.190 --> 21:06.170
Oh no. Come on come on...

21:06.210 --> 21:08.220
Fucking buy, buy!

21:09.350 --> 21:12.190
For fuck's sake! Damn it.

21:13.230 --> 21:15.400
Are you okay?
Yep, fine.

21:16.190 --> 21:20.250
You look like you could use a smoke Paul.
I'm alright, I've too much work to do.

21:20.290 --> 21:23.340
Just one.
Okay.

21:27.410 --> 21:29.240
Talk to me, Paul.

21:30.310 --> 21:32.940
I don't blame Massimo for anything but fuck it now man,

21:32.940 --> 21:34.940
if he's playing games with our jobs...

21:36.290 --> 21:43.260
Massimo has turned us into the
most successful unit at this bank.

21:43.300 --> 21:45.700
Do you think where we'd gonna be without this guy?

21:45.700 --> 21:47.240
Yeah I know that, and I love him, Kalim.

21:47.240 --> 21:50.410
But I can't afford to be
on the fucking scrap. I've got a wife,

21:51.200 --> 21:53.310
I've got two kids to put trough private school.

21:53.350 --> 21:55.320
And plus a bad habit to support.

21:58.230 --> 22:03.170
Massimo has never let us down
You think he's gonna start now?

22:04.280 --> 22:06.190
No.
Exactly.

22:06.230 --> 22:10.220
Let's just keep doing our jobs.
That's all we can do.

22:12.410 --> 22:15.300
Come on, man. Look at you. Exactly!

22:16.270 --> 22:18.350
Fuck off. I'll follow you up.

22:38.300 --> 22:42.300
Good! Okay. Pull!

22:44.360 --> 22:48.190
Let's say best of three, shall we?
Okay.

22:51.350 --> 22:56.220
Pull!
I'm sorry. My turn.

22:56.260 --> 22:58.200
You're gonna lose.
Pull!

23:05.380 --> 23:07.260
Thank you.

23:07.300 --> 23:11.240
I don't think you're here
because my hedge fund suits you.

23:11.280 --> 23:14.310
No.
I think you want revenge on Dominic Morgan.

23:14.350 --> 23:18.210
You're trying to use me to get it.
I need to know how.

23:18.250 --> 23:24.230
I'm gonna make Black Ship the biggest
hedge fund in the world, by bankrupting NYL.

23:26.180 --> 23:27.350
Explain.

23:33.310 --> 23:37.380
I think Ed Stuart killed himself because
he was falsifying the figures.

23:38.170 --> 23:41.320
If I can I prove it,
it'll wipe out the NYL stock.

23:41.360 --> 23:44.340
You're paid in stock. You'll be wiping yourself out too.

23:44.380 --> 23:48.290
Not if my new partner knows
when the news is coming

23:48.330 --> 23:51.270
and I short NYL stocks the night before.

23:51.310 --> 23:56.190
People go to jail for that kind of things.
If they get caught, yes.

23:56.230 --> 24:00.290
You can make 100,
perhaps 200 million over night.

24:00.330 --> 24:04.230
All I'll have to do is commit criminal conspiracy.

24:04.270 --> 24:07.390
And hire you.
And my team, yes.

24:11.350 --> 24:14.410
Dominic Morgan was
like a father to you.

24:15.200 --> 24:17.360
You're betraying him. Why?

24:22.250 --> 24:27.210
You're right Massimo. You're not like other men
I won't hire your team.

24:29.350 --> 24:33.220
They'd make a 1000 times
what they earn in the first year.

24:33.260 --> 24:36.190
One day you may turn on me
like you're turning on Dominic.

24:37.210 --> 24:41.280
if you do, I don't want your team
there to help with the knives in my back.

24:41.320 --> 24:44.230
Come alone or not at all.

24:45.280 --> 24:47.240
Deal?

25:01.300 --> 25:03.300
Don't spill it.
Don't worry.

25:03.340 --> 25:06.190
I've fucking steady hands.
Pull here, babe.

25:09.250 --> 25:13.240
Tell me, how much money you made today.

25:13.280 --> 25:15.210
You talk too much.

25:28.230 --> 25:30.380
Alex! What are we having?

25:32.390 --> 25:35.300
We should talk.
Sure.

25:35.340 --> 25:39.370
Didn't see you down here that much.
What's this? Early bonus?

25:39.410 --> 25:46.260
The girl in the photograph.
She's 16, Paul.

25:46.300 --> 25:50.390
16. The reputational damage
alone warrants instant dismiss.

25:51.180 --> 25:55.320
What? No. Come on man
you know, this is nothing.

25:55.360 --> 26:00.230
But the good news is that there's still a chance
that you could keep the job.

26:01.270 --> 26:06.250
So you've been following me?
All you have to do is keep me abreast of development.

26:07.220 --> 26:10.320
No. I'm not spying on Massimo.

26:10.360 --> 26:15.380
I know how loyal you're to Massimo,
but I've got to ask. How loyal is he to you?

26:19.240 --> 26:25.320
Let me know how it goes, your divorce.
When I show your wife those photographs.

26:29.310 --> 26:31.260
Wait.

27:04.390 --> 27:10.410
The military say that many do consider

27:11.200 --> 27:13.370
their currency as a weapon...

27:13.410 --> 27:19.380
Good morning, you may be in line
for a pay-rise despite of a tough job market...

27:25.340 --> 27:27.300
Always running.

27:45.390 --> 27:48.280
Good morning, mr. Morgan.
Good morning. Thank you.

28:07.230 --> 28:12.300
Dominic! You're early. I can't tell you
how much you being here it means to Kristina.

28:12.340 --> 28:17.310
I'm afraid, I can't stay.
But I wanted to give you this first.

28:17.310 --> 28:19.310
It's for you. Please, open it.

28:32.250 --> 28:38.200
Thank you, but what does it mean?
You see this? "A Pluribus Unum."

28:38.240 --> 28:42.350
"From many, one." It's my country's motto.
We are stronger together.

28:42.390 --> 28:48.550
United under a single currency.
Dominic you haven't come here to discuss currency.

28:48.600 --> 28:51.390
I don't need you to talk. Just listen.

28:51.390 --> 28:55.410
We have a pact, you and me,
and you're going to honor it.

28:56.390 --> 29:02.290
Our pact is a separate matter.
No it is not.

29:05.240 --> 29:08.170
You're threatening me
on the day of my daughter's wedding?

29:08.210 --> 29:12.190
Relax.
I don't know what you think I can do?

29:12.230 --> 29:14.260
I've total faith that you'll work it out.

29:14.300 --> 29:19.290
If you have difficulties,
turn to the dollar for inspiration.

29:20.230 --> 29:23.200
Papa!
Look who's here!

29:23.240 --> 29:26.410
How are you?
Please give my best to your mother.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.280
Auf Wiedersehen.

30:16.320 --> 30:18.280
Have a good night.

31:12.210 --> 31:14.270
Lira for your thoughts.

31:18.390 --> 31:20.380
Good morning.
Good morning.

31:22.250 --> 31:24.410
You're some kind of artist?

31:28.230 --> 31:29.350
Yeah, some kind.

31:31.180 --> 31:33.260
What about you?
Student.

31:33.300 --> 31:35.330
Yes ...!
What?

31:37.170 --> 31:39.290
What are you studying?
Economics.

31:39.330 --> 31:41.270
Okay.

31:42.370 --> 31:48.220
I have got a lecture,so...
Always running.

31:49.370 --> 31:54.260
I guess you get good marks
Top of your class.

31:55.390 --> 31:58.280
Possibly.
Definitely.

32:01.210 --> 32:02.330
Where're you running to?

32:09.320 --> 32:11.340
Come back to bed.

32:13.310 --> 32:19.170
I really should get going.
No, it's alright.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.230
Come back to bed.

32:30.170 --> 32:32.270
You don't have to keep running.

32:34.310 --> 32:38.180
From now on, I'll take care of you.

32:41.250 --> 32:43.180
Okay.

32:47.350 --> 32:50.180
I'm going to stop now.

32:53.210 --> 32:55.280
My turn to take care of you.

33:16.210 --> 33:18.320
You've gotta be shitting me.

33:20.260 --> 33:21.340
Stay here.

33:33.380 --> 33:37.390
Hey.
Did you hack into the computer?

33:37.390 --> 33:40.180
One condition. Please.

33:40.180 --> 33:44.290
Don't turn up here in this thing again.
I don't need the trouble.

33:44.330 --> 33:46.270
Okay.

33:47.200 --> 33:50.190
Couldn't find much but It's all there.
Taking my brother for a ride?

33:50.230 --> 33:53.270
Tyrone, what did I say?
You know what? Get in.

33:53.310 --> 33:57.260
Let me come!
Literary 0 chances. Get inside!

34:45.320 --> 34:49.969
Mr. Ruggero?
Damn, let me be you.

34:49.969 --> 34:51.409
Wait over there.

34:51.409 --> 34:54.400
I expected to have the story by now.

34:55.190 --> 34:58.230
Did you get the reporter?
Hilary Mason.

34:58.270 --> 35:02.400
Okay. Meet me at 7.30.
Okay. Right.

35:03.190 --> 35:05.220
Hey! Where?

35:05.260 --> 35:07.330
I'll text you.
Okay.

35:12.360 --> 35:18.210
Massimo met Li Acheng yesterday.
Job interview, apparently.

35:18.250 --> 35:21.350
Where are we at with Paul?
He's on the no illusions.

35:21.390 --> 35:23.340
Good.

35:27.400 --> 35:31.400
Good morning. I need a
guest pass card for Oliver Harris.

35:33.390 --> 35:37.190
Hey. For you.

36:12.350 --> 36:16.180
Where are we?
Trichet is leaving the meeting whit the ECB.

36:16.220 --> 36:20.260
We are down 50 million.
We're too long on German bonds. We should get out.

36:20.300 --> 36:21.390
Come on.
I don't understand.

36:22.180 --> 36:26.220
If the president of the European Central Bank
says he is raising interest rates

36:26.260 --> 36:28.340
we'll recover our loss and make profits for five years.

36:28.380 --> 36:32.220
And if he lowers them?
We're out 50 million dollars.

36:32.260 --> 36:33.370
Massimo hold?

36:35.360 --> 36:37.250
Ask him.

36:41.330 --> 36:43.180
Are you kidding, right?

36:43.220 --> 36:47.360
What do you say? Will he raise interest
rates or lower them?

36:47.360 --> 36:48.760
Massimo, let's get out, now!

36:48.760 --> 36:50.760
What do you say Oliver?

37:07.210 --> 37:10.190
He's raising them. He's gonna raise the rates.
He's guessing!

37:10.230 --> 37:14.200
Massimo, for real!
Do what Oliver says. We hold.

37:14.240 --> 37:16.400
Thank you, everybody.

37:17.190 --> 37:21.300
I am pleased to say that we will
raise interest rates by 0.1%.

37:21.340 --> 37:25.260
Never a dull moment, huh, Massimo?

37:25.300 --> 37:27.220
Un-fucking-believable.

37:27.260 --> 37:31.210
What made you say he was going to raise them?
It was just the way he walked.

37:31.250 --> 37:35.240
Tense. Like he had something
to say that no one expected.

37:35.280 --> 37:39.350
You read him. Just like
you read Davenport at the restaurant.

37:39.390 --> 37:44.250
I think you might have a
talent for this kind of work. Good job.

38:16.290 --> 38:18.170
Hey.
Hey.

38:18.210 --> 38:21.180
Any news?

38:22.300 --> 38:25.340
I was thinking about Ed Stuart.
What is it?

38:26.380 --> 38:28.360
The contents of Ed's laptop.

38:30.370 --> 38:32.290
Right...

38:33.270 --> 38:38.260
So... what's happening?
What's the big plan?

38:39.300 --> 38:43.340
I'm meeting a reporter from The Guardian.
I'm gonna tell her whatever I find.

38:43.380 --> 38:48.180
Massimo if it shows that Ed
falsified the financial records...

38:48.220 --> 38:51.210
NYL stocks will plummet.
So'll our shares.

38:51.250 --> 38:53.410
We'll still make money.
How?

38:55.300 --> 38:59.210
I just got off the phone with
Li Acheng from Black Ship.

38:59.250 --> 39:04.340
He's shorting NYL as we speak.
You're playing an awfully dangerous game.

39:08.290 --> 39:12.330
Go home guys. Get some sleep.
See you.

39:30.280 --> 39:34.210
I think he's a little bit late. I'm sorry.
Bankers.

39:37.190 --> 39:40.260
Oliver, tell me about the laptop.
There is nothing.

39:40.300 --> 39:47.410
The only thing I could find is the file
with your name on it. Yes bu the file is empty.

39:49.370 --> 39:54.170
Can you tell who erased it?
Maybe. It'll be a little time.

39:54.210 --> 39:59.380
You need to get it back.
Actually I still have it.

40:11.280 --> 40:12.370
Yeah, it's Paul...

40:18.230 --> 40:20.190
Hey!

40:23.390 --> 40:27.270
Ed's computer. There was
something else...

40:27.310 --> 40:29.410
Should I get Paul back?
No it's ok.

40:32.180 --> 40:35.380
Someone logged into Ed's laptop,
two hours after he died.

40:37.370 --> 40:41.310
He deleted a single file.
There was my name on it.

40:43.180 --> 40:44.380
It was called "Massimo Ruggero".

40:45.170 --> 40:48.180
Why would Ed have
a file under your name?

40:58.340 --> 41:00.270
Mr. Vance is here.

41:03.320 --> 41:06.370
Excuse me. It'll be a minute.

41:11.280 --> 41:14.380
Yeah?
Hilary Mason.

41:15.170 --> 41:18.280
From The Guardian. I track her phone
to a pub in Marylebone.

41:18.320 --> 41:22.240
Massimo must have retrieved
something from Edward's laptop.

41:25.330 --> 41:31.230
If this report sees the light of day,
this bank, everything...

41:32.330 --> 41:33.410
You know what I'm saying?

41:44.410 --> 41:47.320
Black Ship Investments.
Li Acheng, please.

41:47.360 --> 41:50.220
Who is calling, please?
Dominic Morgan.

41:50.260 --> 41:52.340
One moment, mr. Morgan.

41:53.310 --> 41:54.390
Dominic.

41:55.180 --> 41:58.370
Li. I understand you've
been talking to Massimo Ruggero.

42:34.390 --> 42:37.350
Mrs. Stuart.
What are you doing here?

42:37.390 --> 42:41.370
I came to offer my condolences.
Flowers would have been fine.

42:41.410 --> 42:44.250
I need to talk to you.

42:45.300 --> 42:49.290
Just five minutes. Please.

42:55.310 --> 42:58.300
I am so sorry about your husband.
You've already said that!

43:01.180 --> 43:02.260
I mean...

43:02.300 --> 43:06.330
So you've come to absolve
your guilty conscience, How noble.

43:12.270 --> 43:14.260
Mrs. Stuart...

43:15.280 --> 43:21.180
Ed and me... we had our differences.

43:21.220 --> 43:26.200
But we both wanted that promotion...
Ed didn't give a toss about your precious bloody promotion.

43:28.330 --> 43:32.280
What?
I couldn't tell the police. I'd have lost my stock options.

43:32.320 --> 43:36.310
Millions worth.
Couldn't tell the police what?

43:36.350 --> 43:40.410
Ed turned down the job because
he resigned from NYL.

43:41.290 --> 43:46.220
He was quitting the business.
He wanted his life back.

43:48.200 --> 43:51.260
You don't have children,
mr. Ruggero?

43:52.300 --> 43:54.340
No.
Don't.

43:54.380 --> 43:57.410
This business destroys families.

43:59.310 --> 44:02.360
It takes your soul, then it takes your life.

44:04.210 --> 44:06.280
What am I supposed to say to the children?

44:07.320 --> 44:13.260
How I'm supposed to explain that their Dad is
dead because of a fucking bank?

44:14.230 --> 44:17.240
So I'm sorry, I won't accept your apology.

44:17.280 --> 44:20.300
You retaliate against my husband
for nothing and now he's dead.

44:20.340 --> 44:22.350
Your five minutes're up.

44:39.230 --> 44:45.320
I'd say he is officially late now, wouldn't you?
Just give me a minute.

45:19.300 --> 45:24.180
Good morning. Another historic morning...
Some big story is breaking this morning in the city...

45:24.220 --> 45:30.170
Let's start with The Guardian...
Several newspapers are running with no lead...

45:41.250 --> 45:44.340
What is happening in the
United States is very uncertain.

45:53.340 --> 45:56.320
Any good news?

46:02.170 --> 46:04.240
I hear you had a look at Ed's computer.

46:04.280 --> 46:07.370
Just wanted to find what
drove him to suicide.

46:07.410 --> 46:12.360
And did you put your mind at ease?
All I found was that someone got to the computer before me.

46:15.270 --> 46:18.240
You didn't tell me Ed Stuart resigned.

46:18.280 --> 46:22.320
I was protecting you.
Right. Like always.

46:28.390 --> 46:33.170
I understand. You didn't
get the job and you're looking for answers.

46:33.210 --> 46:37.410
You wiped data off from Ed's
laptop, hours after he died.

46:39.350 --> 46:44.270
What would it look like if the police had
found that falsified documents on Ed's computer?

46:44.310 --> 46:48.280
When the board discovered the fraud,
he was fired on the spot.

46:49.360 --> 46:54.350
We allowed him to claim
resignation to protect his good name.

46:54.390 --> 46:58.220
Obviously he chose a much
more permanent way out.

46:58.260 --> 47:00.320
I get it, you were protecting him too.

47:00.360 --> 47:05.250
Claire and the kids they suffered enough.

47:05.290 --> 47:08.320
They don't need his name
dragged to the mud.

47:08.360 --> 47:14.280
So that's it? No one's to blame
for Ed's death but himself?

47:19.170 --> 47:23.370
I want you to take some time off.
Go spend it with Carrie.

47:25.400 --> 47:27.290
Yes.

47:36.270 --> 47:39.270
This time I'm not gonna let her go.

47:53.330 --> 47:56.230
Hey. What's up?

48:12.210 --> 48:17.240
You called Alex Vance last night.
Moments after we spoke.

48:19.400 --> 48:21.370
How do you know that?

48:24.240 --> 48:27.270
They had photos, Massimo, they
were gonna share. I had no choice.

48:27.310 --> 48:29.280
Coming to me was a choice.

48:29.320 --> 48:34.210
Watch you off negotiating your contract\band leaving us behind, that's your choice.

48:34.250 --> 48:38.220
We were a team, Paul.
That was never gonna happen.

48:41.400 --> 48:43.250
Well, no harm done.

48:44.220 --> 48:47.410
You'll stay, I've learned my lesson so...
I'm sorry.

48:48.200 --> 48:50.220
Massimo please...
Go home Paul.

48:52.410 --> 48:56.290
Don't come back. You are finished.

48:56.330 --> 48:58.220
Max...
Go.

49:11.240 --> 49:15.230
What was that?
Are we going to Black Ship?

49:17.170 --> 49:18.340
No.

49:18.380 --> 49:21.280
Were we?
Maybe.

49:23.360 --> 49:29.260
Why don't we go?
Because I don't think Ed Stuart killed himself.

49:31.270 --> 49:37.260
He didn't want the job.
And Carrie... It wasn't him.

49:39.330 --> 49:41.280
Wait...

49:42.250 --> 49:46.280
Are we saying.. Ed was murdered?

49:56.310 --> 49:58.240
Yes?
Is that Mr. Rogarrow?

49:58.280 --> 50:02.220
Ruggero, yes.
This is nurse Saldon from the Royal Free.

50:02.260 --> 50:05.280
I'm heading there now.
How's my wife?

50:05.320 --> 50:08.230
They couldn't bring her out of the coma.

50:08.270 --> 50:13.380
I'm so sorry, but
she past away 20 minutes ago.

50:37.350 --> 50:43.290
You don't have to keep running
From now on, I will take care of you.

50:53.240 --> 50:56.330
IMF's director Dominic Strauss – Kahn

50:56.370 --> 51:00.400
has resigned whilst in custody of NY
over allegations of sexual assault

51:01.190 --> 51:02.410
which he strongly denied.

51:03.200 --> 51:07.200
..crowds gathered in
Washington D.C. to join...

51:07.240 --> 51:09.310
God can't beat the Devil.

51:09.350 --> 51:14.200
He has always existed,
and he always will.

51:15.230 --> 51:21.180
I know, because I've breathed
the Devil's fire into my lungs.

51:25.310 --> 51:29.180
I've burnt his dark soul into my own.

51:32.210 --> 51:35.370
God can't b eat the Devil,
but no matter the what it takes...

51:39.230 --> 51:41.190
I will.

51:45.330 --> 51:51.180
Why is it right to encourage the
leaking of secret informations?

51:51.380 --> 51:57.320
You need yo ask yourself what sort of information is
important in the world today. What'll cause disruption?

51:57.360 --> 52:03.260
Think about the length that people
on the inside of certain organizations will go to

52:03.300 --> 52:08.300
In order to conceal what they're doing.
These are the new gods. Really.

52:09.330 --> 52:14.400
These are the new gods.
These are the new gods.
