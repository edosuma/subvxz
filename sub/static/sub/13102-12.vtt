WEBVTT

00:01.875 --> 00:04.917
[dramatic music]

00:09.000 --> 00:10.750
- Ready?
- Not yet.

00:10.833 --> 00:13.417
I've got two dozen
more copies of this treaty

00:13.500 --> 00:15.583
to sign before the meeting.

00:15.667 --> 00:20.083
Who knew that the presidency was
50% panic and 50% paperwork?

00:20.167 --> 00:23.000
- Give me five more minutes.
- We're already late.

00:23.083 --> 00:25.417
I know, I know.
Can you stall them a bit?

00:25.500 --> 00:29.750
Not a problem. I'll tell them
we're declaring war on Earth.

00:29.833 --> 00:31.583
That'll give them something
positive to think about.

00:31.667 --> 00:35.583
Good, good. Give me
the paperwork and I'll sign it.

00:35.667 --> 00:37.292
Done.

00:57.708 --> 00:59.583
Sorry I'm late.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.875
They're not here.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.792
'The members of
the alliance voted to boycott'

01:09.875 --> 01:12.458
'all future meetings
of the council'

01:12.542 --> 01:14.167
'until we can guarantee
the safety of their'

01:14.250 --> 01:16.458
shipping lines against
the recent series of attacks.

01:16.542 --> 01:19.958
Why the hell are we getting
the sole rap for this?

01:20.042 --> 01:23.000
Shouldn't their own governments
be pitching in?

01:23.083 --> 01:25.583
Each government can only operate
its military

01:25.667 --> 01:28.958
within its own borders
without causing an incident.

01:29.042 --> 01:33.333
It's the spaces in between where
their ships are being attacked.

01:33.417 --> 01:36.083
They say that if we are not
strong enough to protect

01:36.167 --> 01:40.167
our own members, or at least
find out who's responsible

01:40.250 --> 01:43.167
what point is there
in belonging to the alliance?

01:45.208 --> 01:46.792
[sighs]

01:46.875 --> 01:51.000
Well, as much as I hate to admit
it, they've got a point.

01:51.083 --> 01:54.417
- Yes, they do.
- We need a break.

01:54.500 --> 01:56.792
A witness. Something.

01:56.875 --> 02:00.458
Yes, we do, badly.

02:00.542 --> 02:03.833
(male #1 on radio)
'This is Red Star Nine.
Is there anyone in the sector?'

02:03.917 --> 02:05.333
'We are under attack.
We are under attack'

02:05.417 --> 02:08.667
Whoa! Jimmy,
you still down there?

02:08.750 --> 02:10.875
Oh! They're jamming the signal.

02:10.958 --> 02:12.833
You gotta give me more power,
maybe we can outrun them.

02:12.917 --> 02:15.083
(Jimmy)
'I'm doing the best I can.'

02:16.417 --> 02:17.667
[explosion]

02:17.750 --> 02:19.875
Jimmy? Jimmy?

02:21.583 --> 02:25.000
Computer, set the life pod
to eject as soon as I'm inside.

02:25.083 --> 02:26.833
(automated voice)
Confirmed.

02:30.292 --> 02:32.333
[explosions]

02:36.500 --> 02:39.542
[intense music]

02:43.625 --> 02:45.000
(Kosh)
And so it begins.

02:45.083 --> 02:46.542
(male #1)
There's a hole in your mind.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.208
(Sinclair)
What do you want?

02:48.292 --> 02:50.625
(G'Kar)
No one here is exactly
what he appears.

02:50.708 --> 02:52.500
(Sinclair)
Nothing's the same anymore.

02:52.583 --> 02:54.708
(Hague)
Commander Sinclair
is being reassigned.

02:54.792 --> 02:56.792
(Londo)
Why don't you eliminate
the entire Narn home-world?

02:56.875 --> 03:00.042
(Elric)
I see a great hand
reaching out of the stars.

03:00.125 --> 03:02.583
(female #1)
President Clark has signed
a decree declaring martial law.

03:02.667 --> 03:05.250
(Sheridan)
These orders have forced us
to declare independence.

03:05.333 --> 03:06.625
Unless your people
get off their

03:06.708 --> 03:08.333
encounter-suited butts
and do something..

03:08.417 --> 03:09.917
(Zathras)
You're the one who was.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.500
(Kosh)
If you go to Z'Ha'Dum,
you will die.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.000
(Lorien)
Why are you here?

03:14.083 --> 03:15.917
Do you have anything
worth living for?

03:16.000 --> 03:17.583
(Delenn)
I think of my
beautiful city in flames.

03:17.667 --> 03:19.500
(Sheridan)
Giants in the playground.

03:19.583 --> 03:21.708
(male #2)
Now, get the hell
out of our galaxy!

03:21.792 --> 03:23.792
(male #3)
We are here to place
President Clark under arrest.

03:23.875 --> 03:26.917
[theme music]

03:56.500 --> 03:59.542
[music continues]

04:12.417 --> 04:15.500
[instrumental music]

04:16.625 --> 04:18.833
G'Kar, it's a strange thing.

04:18.917 --> 04:23.000
In the past it was a great
relief t-to leave Babylon 5

04:23.083 --> 04:25.500
and a great joy
to return home.

04:25.583 --> 04:27.583
Now it is a relief
to leave Centauri Prime

04:27.667 --> 04:30.167
and be anywhere else.

04:30.250 --> 04:32.208
I don't know what
to call home anymore.

04:32.292 --> 04:34.000
Well, have you considered
the possibility that

04:34.083 --> 04:37.000
you're simply not meant to be
happy no matter where you are?

04:37.083 --> 04:40.083
No, I haven't.
Not until you mentioned it.

04:40.167 --> 04:41.625
I thought you were
supposed to be protecting me

04:41.708 --> 04:43.125
looking out
for my best interests.

04:43.208 --> 04:46.875
I am. The warrior in me
is watching out for your life.

04:46.958 --> 04:49.708
But the Narn in me has decided
it's your spirit

04:49.792 --> 04:51.500
that's in the greatest
need of protection.

04:51.583 --> 04:54.417
Is it me, or are people
looking at us?

04:54.500 --> 04:55.958
Well, at me, actually.

04:56.042 --> 04:58.625
- Why?
- I don't know.

04:58.708 --> 05:00.792
I'm honored, sir.

05:00.875 --> 05:02.417
He seems very glad to see you.

05:02.500 --> 05:05.458
Yes, but we weren't gone
that long. Less than a month.

05:05.542 --> 05:08.875
Well, there you have the key to
your popularity. Your absence.

05:08.958 --> 05:11.875
Go away for a month and they
bow, go away for six months

05:11.958 --> 05:14.208
they'll tear the place apart
when you come back.

05:14.292 --> 05:17.458
Perhaps you should go away
and never come back again.

05:17.542 --> 05:19.875
Then your popularity
will be so overwhelming

05:19.958 --> 05:21.542
it would blacken the stars.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.458
No, I have always
said this about you.

05:23.542 --> 05:26.542
Nothing so improves your company
like the lack of it.

05:26.625 --> 05:28.917
The less they see of you,
the more they like you.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.708
No, no. Wait-wait. Perhaps you
can make some money from this.

05:31.792 --> 05:35.042
Ten credits for you
not to be there for an hour.

05:35.125 --> 05:37.083
A 100 credits for you not
to be there for the day.

05:37.167 --> 05:40.625
And for you not to be there
the rest of your life, well..

05:40.708 --> 05:42.833
...they could never afford it.

05:47.375 --> 05:49.333
[indistinct chattering]

05:49.417 --> 05:51.458
[beeping]

05:55.792 --> 05:58.750
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

05:58.833 --> 06:02.458
Just a second. Receive.

06:02.542 --> 06:04.833
Hey, Michael,
where you been..

06:04.917 --> 06:08.625
- Did I wake you?
- Yeah. What time is it?

06:08.708 --> 06:11.958
- Ten o'clock.
- Ten!

06:12.042 --> 06:14.417
Oh, man, I must have
forgot to set the alarm.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.375
You okay?
You look like crap.

06:16.458 --> 06:19.958
Why, thank you, Zack. I think
you look pretty cute too.

06:20.042 --> 06:21.958
It's just I, uh,
I didn't sleep very well.

06:22.042 --> 06:25.417
I must be coming down with
a cold or something. What's up?

06:25.500 --> 06:27.292
Well, we had an appointment
this morning

06:27.375 --> 06:30.042
to go over some reports,
which you missed

06:30.125 --> 06:31.875
and Delenn just called
to set up a meeting

06:31.958 --> 06:34.167
in a half an hour in
the president's office.

06:34.250 --> 06:35.542
- I'll be there.
- 'You sure?'

06:35.625 --> 06:37.125
'Because if you're
not feeling well..'

06:37.208 --> 06:40.000
I'll be fine. Tell him
I'll be there with bells on.

06:40.083 --> 06:42.375
Well, at least that way,
we'll know how to find you.

06:42.458 --> 06:44.333
Security out.

06:50.875 --> 06:53.917
[instrumental music]

07:02.875 --> 07:04.833
(Delenn)
I think we have
some good news.

07:04.917 --> 07:06.833
A flight of rangers sent
to investigate an attack

07:06.917 --> 07:09.958
on several Drazi ships
found a life pod missing

07:10.042 --> 07:11.500
on one of the transports.

07:11.583 --> 07:13.125
Then we've got a survivor.

07:13.208 --> 07:14.250
Somebody who can finally
tell us

07:14.333 --> 07:15.542
who's behind these attacks.

07:15.625 --> 07:18.500
- We think so.
- What kind of transport?

07:18.583 --> 07:22.292
- That's where it gets dicey.
- It was a human transport.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.667
We think he may have been
smuggling illegal goods

07:24.750 --> 07:28.167
and cargo into Drazi space
on orders from their government.

07:28.250 --> 07:29.375
- That's great.
- Wait a minute.

07:29.458 --> 07:31.375
The Drazi government?

07:31.458 --> 07:33.667
What kind of illegal goods?

07:33.750 --> 07:35.958
Every race that joins
the alliance agrees to boycott

07:36.042 --> 07:38.333
items on the prohibited list.
Dust.

07:38.417 --> 07:41.417
Certain other drugs used
to control and violate people.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.958
An assortment of really
nasty biological weapons.

07:44.042 --> 07:45.333
That sort of thing.

07:45.417 --> 07:47.542
Officially, they agree
to keep the stuff out.

07:47.625 --> 07:49.833
But, unofficially, they buy
and sell it all the time.

07:49.917 --> 07:52.958
They use it to control colonies,
trade for resources, whatever.

07:53.042 --> 07:55.375
They subcontract with smugglers
to bring the stuff in.

07:55.458 --> 07:56.792
That way, if anything goes wrong

07:56.875 --> 07:58.458
the government can deny
any knowledge of it.

07:58.542 --> 07:59.917
Which means we can
pretty much forget about

08:00.000 --> 08:02.875
any cooperation
from the Drazi government.

08:02.958 --> 08:05.792
So that leaves
two questions in front of us.

08:05.875 --> 08:10.083
One. Did he survive and make it
back to the Drazi home-world?

08:10.167 --> 08:14.042
Two. Can we find him and get him
to testify about what he saw?

08:14.125 --> 08:15.750
Now, there's only
one way to know for sure

08:15.833 --> 08:17.708
and that's to go in
and take a look.

08:17.792 --> 08:19.583
'I know a guy who's
a security consultant'

08:19.667 --> 08:21.333
in the Drazi capital.

08:21.417 --> 08:22.750
I worked with him
back when we were stationed

08:22.833 --> 08:24.417
on the mining
colony on Europa.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.583
He had the good sense to get
the hell out before I did.

08:27.667 --> 08:30.417
If anybody can find this guy,
it's him.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.083
That's assuming
the pilot's still alive.

08:32.167 --> 08:34.833
Good, if he is, I want him
brought back here

08:34.917 --> 08:36.583
as fast as possible
so we can get him

08:36.667 --> 08:39.250
to testify before the council.

08:39.333 --> 08:41.875
Stephen, I want you
to go along with Garibaldi.

08:41.958 --> 08:44.750
- 'Watch his back and--'
- 'I'd, uh..'

08:44.833 --> 08:46.833
(Garibaldi)
'I'd rather he not.'

08:49.375 --> 08:51.125
Look, this is a delicate
situation and my guy

08:51.208 --> 08:53.958
is not gonna trust
anybody except me.

08:54.042 --> 08:56.375
So, what you're saying is,
you don't want me along.

08:56.458 --> 08:58.333
No, that's not what I'm saying.

08:58.417 --> 08:59.958
What I'm saying is, you're gonna
be spending all your time

09:00.042 --> 09:02.833
at the Drazi Hilton because he's
not gonna wanna talk to you.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.958
You might as well
just stay here.

09:06.042 --> 09:08.917
'Now, you want me to do this,
I gotta do it my way.'

09:09.000 --> 09:11.708
I know what I'm getting into.
I'll be alright.

09:15.750 --> 09:18.458
Alright, pack your bags.

09:18.542 --> 09:20.417
The next shuttle
that leaves through Drazi space

09:20.500 --> 09:22.417
is in one hour.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.542
[indistinct chatter]

09:32.708 --> 09:35.500
Ta'lon. Ta'lon, is it you?

09:37.167 --> 09:40.542
It's me most days, except for
those days when I don't feel

09:40.625 --> 09:44.208
quite like myself and I suppose
that I am someone else

09:44.292 --> 09:45.667
but for now, yes, it's me.

09:45.750 --> 09:48.125
This is wonderful,
where have you been?

09:48.208 --> 09:49.875
I go where the sword is needed.

09:49.958 --> 09:52.625
Most recently, guarding cargo
to and from the home-world

09:52.708 --> 09:56.375
to help with rebuilding,
food, supplies, small weapons.

09:56.458 --> 09:58.250
Whatever the alliance
will allow.

09:58.333 --> 10:00.292
And some other important items

10:00.375 --> 10:02.917
big ones, small ones

10:03.000 --> 10:06.833
some you may even recognize.

10:06.917 --> 10:10.500
What else did you
take home from here, Ta'lon?

10:10.583 --> 10:12.625
[beeping]

10:15.583 --> 10:17.167
Where is my book, Ta'lon?

10:17.250 --> 10:20.500
The book I have been writing
for the last two years.

10:20.583 --> 10:22.708
That's what I wanted
to see you about.

10:22.792 --> 10:25.167
You must understand,
G'Kar, that all we knew

10:25.250 --> 10:28.333
is that you went
with Mollari to Centauri Prime.

10:28.417 --> 10:30.042
Many of us felt
that you had been taken prisoner

10:30.125 --> 10:31.333
or were going to be executed--

10:31.417 --> 10:34.375
Where is my book?
It is my only copy.

10:34.458 --> 10:37.417
Yes, that is
precisely the point.

10:37.500 --> 10:40.375
The Kha'Ri felt
if anything happened to you

10:40.458 --> 10:43.708
the book of G'Kar would
never see the light of day

10:43.792 --> 10:46.000
so we liberated it.

10:46.083 --> 10:49.625
- Liberated it?
- We took it home.

10:49.708 --> 10:52.958
Those that read it
were very moved by it.

10:53.042 --> 10:54.625
And they made some copies.

10:54.708 --> 10:57.167
- Copies!
- Just a few.

10:57.250 --> 10:59.042
For their friends.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.792
Then a few more
made a few more copies.

11:01.875 --> 11:04.083
How many?

11:04.167 --> 11:06.292
Well, it's hard to say, exactly.

11:06.375 --> 11:08.750
There was some confusion
when it went to the printers.

11:08.833 --> 11:10.333
Printers!

11:10.417 --> 11:12.458
I've only been gone
for a month, Ta'lon.

11:12.542 --> 11:15.917
There can't be that many copies
floating around this quickly.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.125
How many?

11:17.208 --> 11:20.667
Five or six hundred..

11:20.750 --> 11:21.750
...thousand.

11:21.833 --> 11:23.167
What?

11:23.250 --> 11:24.417
I have been told

11:24.500 --> 11:27.417
that it will outsell
the book of G'Quan.

11:31.333 --> 11:34.083
Congratulations,
citizen G'Kar.

11:34.167 --> 11:36.875
You are now a religious icon.

11:41.917 --> 11:43.292
Remember to check in with Delenn
twice a day while I'm gone

11:43.375 --> 11:44.708
keep up with the latest
from the rangers.

11:44.792 --> 11:47.042
Michael, I know the routine,
I got it covered.

11:47.125 --> 11:48.750
You just worry about getting
yourself back in one piece

11:48.833 --> 11:50.125
and let me take care
of the rest.

11:50.208 --> 11:51.833
Michael, can I talk
to you for a minute?

11:51.917 --> 11:55.208
I was just, uh..
Yeah, sure.

11:55.292 --> 11:56.375
Yeah, I'll tell them
you're coming.

11:56.458 --> 11:57.958
Thanks.

11:58.042 --> 11:59.625
Um, I wanted to talk
to you before you left

11:59.708 --> 12:02.708
just to find out
if you and I are okay.

12:02.792 --> 12:05.500
What're you talking about?
Of course, we're okay.

12:05.583 --> 12:07.958
Well, then why didn't
you want me on this mission?

12:08.042 --> 12:10.000
- I-I told you.
- No, no. You gave me reasons.

12:10.083 --> 12:12.458
Yes, all very logical
very sensible reasons.

12:12.542 --> 12:14.750
But, I-I'm not talking
about what you said.

12:14.833 --> 12:16.292
I'm talking about
the way you said it.

12:16.375 --> 12:18.000
No, no, no. Wait. Now, look.

12:18.083 --> 12:19.625
I'm getting a definite
impression you don't want me

12:19.708 --> 12:21.833
around on a personal level
so now I gotta ask

12:21.917 --> 12:23.417
you and I okay?

12:23.500 --> 12:27.208
Yeah, of course we're okay.
Come on, Stephen, this is me.

12:27.292 --> 12:29.292
I'm just looking out
for a friend, that's all.

12:29.375 --> 12:31.167
If you weren't a friend,
I'd have you along in a second

12:31.250 --> 12:32.500
but you are.

12:32.583 --> 12:33.958
This could get really
bad and like I said

12:34.042 --> 12:36.875
my contact's not gonna
trust anybody but me.

12:36.958 --> 12:39.667
- That's all?
- That's all.

12:39.750 --> 12:41.750
Look, I got a transport fueling
up and waiting for me.

12:41.833 --> 12:43.875
Is there anything else?

12:43.958 --> 12:45.208
- No.
- Alright.

12:45.292 --> 12:47.292
I'll see you in
a couple of weeks.

12:47.375 --> 12:48.875
(Stephen)
'Michael.'

12:50.042 --> 12:52.083
You know, if you ever
got a problem

12:52.167 --> 12:54.417
a-anything at all
you want to talk about

12:54.500 --> 12:56.833
you know where to find me,
don't you?

12:56.917 --> 12:59.375
I hear you. See you.

13:03.500 --> 13:06.583
[instrumental music]

13:22.292 --> 13:27.333
Ah! Good morning, G'Kar!
Well, this is a delight.

13:27.417 --> 13:29.167
I didn't know
you had children.

13:29.250 --> 13:30.292
Neither did I.

13:30.375 --> 13:33.375
Yes, most unsettling
when that happens.

13:33.458 --> 13:36.375
And in your case,
most amusing.

13:36.458 --> 13:38.667
Now, is this the book of G'Kar

13:38.750 --> 13:41.125
that I have been hearing so much
about since I got back?

13:41.208 --> 13:43.583
Apparently, they are finding
it useful in learning

13:43.667 --> 13:47.667
how to get along
with other races, even yours.

13:47.750 --> 13:49.500
Hm! Yes.

13:49.583 --> 13:53.542
- And am I in here?
- Not by name. By description.

13:53.625 --> 13:56.292
Na'Tak Burella.
It's a colloquialism.

13:56.375 --> 13:59.375
- Which means?
- Prideful wind catcher.

13:59.458 --> 14:04.208
Well, as Mr. Garibaldi says, "I
think I'll wait for the movie."

14:04.292 --> 14:05.917
Well, actually,
I was looking for Delenn.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.542
I just heard our next Council
meeting has been postponed.

14:08.625 --> 14:12.333
Yes, indefinitely. I'll let her
fill you in with the details.

14:12.417 --> 14:15.417
Fortunately,
we appear to have had a break.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.750
We'll know more in a few days.

14:21.292 --> 14:24.333
[intense music]

14:33.500 --> 14:35.500
[whizzing]

14:39.750 --> 14:41.792
[gagging]

14:53.250 --> 14:55.167
[whosshing]

14:55.917 --> 14:59.000
[instrumental music]

15:28.917 --> 15:32.000
[music continues]

15:38.792 --> 15:40.833
[whooshing]

15:52.875 --> 15:55.667
That's a great way
to get yourself killed.

15:55.750 --> 15:57.708
Just checking
your reactions to see

15:57.792 --> 16:01.042
if time had slowed them down.

16:01.125 --> 16:04.583
I think they're even better
than the last time I saw you.

16:04.667 --> 16:06.417
Yeah, well, when you get stabbed
and shot in the back

16:06.500 --> 16:09.625
enough times sooner or later you
learn to look behind you.

16:09.708 --> 16:13.875
- And they said you were slow.
- Tafiq.

16:13.958 --> 16:17.000
[laughing]
Oh! Good to see you.

16:17.083 --> 16:19.167
- How've you been?
- And you. Good.

16:19.250 --> 16:21.625
The Drazi pay well
for human security.

16:21.708 --> 16:24.958
It's a status symbol among them.

16:25.042 --> 16:28.958
But since there are
very few formal occasions

16:29.042 --> 16:30.708
there's a lot of downtime.

16:30.792 --> 16:35.625
I read. I exercise.
I follow your career.

16:35.708 --> 16:37.042
You've done well, Michael.

16:37.125 --> 16:39.583
- You should be proud.
- Ah! Thank you.

16:39.667 --> 16:41.750
Truth is, sometimes I wonder
what it would be like

16:41.833 --> 16:44.333
if I had left Europa
when you did.

16:44.417 --> 16:46.750
Maybe I would've had
a quieter life.

16:46.833 --> 16:50.208
Quiet is not your way,
my friend.

16:50.292 --> 16:52.583
Maybe, maybe.
So you got my message?

16:52.667 --> 16:55.583
Hm, my sources tell me
the pilot you are looking for

16:55.667 --> 16:57.792
has gone into hiding.

16:57.875 --> 17:01.083
His employers are not happy
that he lost their ship.

17:01.167 --> 17:05.833
And the Drazi agents, awaiting
his delivery of illegal supplies

17:05.917 --> 17:09.417
plan to take their losses
out on him.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.958
'They know your people
found a missing life pod'

17:12.042 --> 17:14.292
'at the site
of the last attack.'

17:14.375 --> 17:16.750
And it would be far
easier for them to deny

17:16.833 --> 17:20.875
knowing anything
about it if he were dead.

17:20.958 --> 17:22.833
Suffice to say

17:22.917 --> 17:25.875
he wants to get off planet
as soon as possible.

17:25.958 --> 17:28.625
Well, that should make my
negotiations a little easier.

17:28.708 --> 17:31.958
That, yes, but getting him off
planet, that will be hard.

17:32.042 --> 17:33.875
[knocking on door]

17:33.958 --> 17:37.333
Ah! Good. Room service.

17:37.417 --> 17:39.958
Tat-tat-tat-tat! Sit.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.083
So, what do you think
of my city?

17:54.500 --> 17:58.292
Well, I think it's hot, crowded,
it's noisy and it's old.

17:58.375 --> 18:01.167
- Thank you.
- And what's with the streets?

18:01.250 --> 18:03.958
They're so narrow,
you can hardly get by.

18:04.042 --> 18:07.000
Tradition. Goes back centuries.

18:07.083 --> 18:09.917
To prevent invaders
from taking their city

18:10.000 --> 18:11.542
they built their
streets too narrow

18:11.625 --> 18:14.167
for armies or engines of war.

18:14.250 --> 18:16.583
When you have to go through
two or three at a time

18:16.667 --> 18:19.500
you are most vulnerable.

18:19.583 --> 18:24.167
See, now you can fly over and
drop these things called bombs.

18:24.250 --> 18:26.292
What's the point?

18:26.375 --> 18:28.792
What's the point
of any tradition?

18:28.875 --> 18:33.917
Look around. The Drazi were
originally an outdoor race.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.667
They came indoors
only when necessary.

18:35.750 --> 18:39.333
So, their rooms were small,
the balconies large.

18:39.417 --> 18:41.667
Now they live indoors
like the rest of us

18:41.750 --> 18:44.000
but the architecture remains.

18:44.083 --> 18:46.042
Your shirt buttons
from the left

18:46.125 --> 18:48.167
but a woman's blouse
buttons from the right

18:48.250 --> 18:51.542
because servants
used to dress them.

18:51.625 --> 18:55.083
The servants are gone,
but the style remains.

18:55.167 --> 18:59.083
- No, no, I don't..
- Don't what?

18:59.167 --> 19:01.542
Y-you're right,
it has been a long time

19:01.625 --> 19:03.417
since we were back on Europa.

19:03.500 --> 19:04.917
Yes.

19:05.958 --> 19:08.292
So when do I get to see
the pilot?

19:08.375 --> 19:10.792
First, I will leave you here
in a little while

19:10.875 --> 19:14.375
to finalize your travel
arrangements back to Babylon 5.

19:14.458 --> 19:18.583
He will meet us tonight in the
park at the base of the hotel.

19:18.667 --> 19:20.875
He has the location
of this balcony

19:20.958 --> 19:23.125
and a precision signal light.

19:23.208 --> 19:26.542
When he's there,
he will let you know.

19:26.625 --> 19:28.083
Then you can talk.

19:28.167 --> 19:31.375
I can get you away
and get back to my life.

19:32.792 --> 19:36.250
Good fortune.
Good health. Good God.

19:36.333 --> 19:38.958
Good God! Skold!

19:43.167 --> 19:45.792
So..

19:45.875 --> 19:48.125
What happened to your hair?

19:55.417 --> 19:57.458
[beeping]

19:58.292 --> 19:59.708
Franklin. Go.

19:59.792 --> 20:00.875
(male #4 on radio)
'Priority message coming in'

20:00.958 --> 20:03.917
'for you from Earth Dome.'

20:04.000 --> 20:06.125
Well, can it wait?
I just sat down to dinner.

20:06.208 --> 20:10.417
(male #4)
'Negative.
They say it's important.'

20:10.500 --> 20:12.917
Alright, I'll take it
in my quarters.

20:17.167 --> 20:19.208
[wind howling]

20:27.792 --> 20:29.833
[humming]

20:34.458 --> 20:35.875
Hm!

20:37.625 --> 20:39.458
Oh, well.

20:45.250 --> 20:47.250
[sighs]

20:48.375 --> 20:50.375
[chuckles]

20:52.833 --> 20:56.042
I'm going to take care
of your travel arrangements.

20:56.125 --> 20:59.167
I'll see you downstairs
when he arrives.

21:01.333 --> 21:04.417
[instrumental music]

21:15.042 --> 21:16.625
(male #5)
'Tafiq!'

21:18.042 --> 21:20.042
[grunting]

21:24.583 --> 21:27.667
[instrumental music]

21:33.583 --> 21:35.000
Tafiq.

21:36.083 --> 21:37.500
Tafiq.

21:42.292 --> 21:43.708
Tafiq?

21:52.625 --> 21:56.292
(Tafiq)
He will meet us tonight in the
park at the base of the hotel.

21:57.583 --> 21:59.667
He has the location
of this balcony

21:59.750 --> 22:02.125
and a precision
signal light.

22:07.125 --> 22:08.958
(Michael)
'Tafiq!'

22:11.458 --> 22:13.500
[grunting]

22:17.375 --> 22:19.417
[grunting]

22:22.792 --> 22:25.833
[intense music]

22:28.625 --> 22:30.667
[screaming]

22:34.333 --> 22:36.375
[breathing heavily]

22:43.167 --> 22:46.250
Tafiq.
Tafiq, can you hear me?

22:46.333 --> 22:50.750
I don't want your shouting
to be the last thing I hear.

22:51.833 --> 22:56.250
- I-I-I'll get a doctor.
- No, no time.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.292
Too late for me.

22:58.375 --> 23:02.625
The pilot. You have to get
to him before they do.

23:02.708 --> 23:04.583
Before the..

23:11.542 --> 23:13.542
[whirring]

23:18.750 --> 23:21.792
[intense music]

23:25.208 --> 23:27.250
[grunting]

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
[whirring]

23:37.042 --> 23:39.125
[screaming]

23:40.083 --> 23:41.917
Leave him alone!

23:44.750 --> 23:46.792
[zapping]

23:48.750 --> 23:50.750
[grunting]

23:55.292 --> 23:58.333
[intense music]

24:05.833 --> 24:07.917
[breathing heavily]

24:13.917 --> 24:15.958
[siren wailing]

24:17.417 --> 24:19.542
[shouting in foreign language]

24:27.667 --> 24:30.750
[music continues]

24:34.292 --> 24:36.417
[shouting in foreign language]

24:42.125 --> 24:44.875
[whirring]

24:44.958 --> 24:47.708
- 'Mr. President?'
- He's not here.

24:47.792 --> 24:49.958
(female #2)
'I've got an emergency
encoded transmission'

24:50.042 --> 24:52.583
'from Mr. Garibaldi
on channel 4.'

24:52.667 --> 24:54.542
Put it through.

24:56.667 --> 24:58.042
Michael!

24:58.125 --> 25:00.875
- Are you alright?
- Not really.

25:00.958 --> 25:02.167
The mission's
completely fubared.

25:02.250 --> 25:03.792
I need to get
out of here ASAP.

25:03.875 --> 25:05.750
Can you take
a civilian transport?

25:05.833 --> 25:07.875
Negative, I don't think they got
a picture but I'm pretty sure

25:07.958 --> 25:10.458
my description's all over
the place. Spaceport, customs.

25:10.542 --> 25:12.875
Everywhere. They're after me.

25:12.958 --> 25:16.458
- 'Who?'
- Everybody.

25:16.542 --> 25:17.750
Is there a White Star
in the area?

25:17.833 --> 25:19.750
- 'Just one.'
- That's all I need.

25:19.833 --> 25:21.750
I'm gonna send my coordinates
up on a sub-channel.

25:21.833 --> 25:23.542
I want you to have
the White Star come in low

25:23.625 --> 25:25.208
land in the field
just outside the capital

25:25.292 --> 25:26.917
long enough for me
to just get on board

25:27.000 --> 25:29.250
and get the hell out of there
before the local boys can react.

25:29.333 --> 25:32.042
You'll have it.
Do you need medical assistance?

25:32.125 --> 25:33.167
No.

25:33.250 --> 25:34.750
No, what I need is
a guy with a claw hammer

25:34.833 --> 25:38.708
to whack me in the head
real hard about nine times.

25:38.792 --> 25:42.542
It's a long story. I'll tell you
when I see you. Thanks, Delenn.

25:43.917 --> 25:46.292
- C and C, this is Delenn.
- 'Yes, ambassador.'

25:46.375 --> 25:48.875
Put me through
to White Star 26.

26:00.208 --> 26:03.042
(G'Kar)
'Go away!'

26:03.125 --> 26:05.000
It's Ta'lon.

26:14.042 --> 26:16.000
G'Kar.

26:16.083 --> 26:18.042
(G'Kar)
'Are they still there?'

26:22.208 --> 26:23.667
Yes.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.625
I think there are
a few more than before.

26:30.417 --> 26:32.042
They would like
to speak to you.

26:32.125 --> 26:34.667
Or more to the point,
I think they would

26:34.750 --> 26:36.833
like you to speak to them.

26:36.917 --> 26:40.333
I have nothing
to say to them.

26:40.417 --> 26:44.833
I turned down a chance to become
ruler of our world, Ta'lon

26:44.917 --> 26:47.833
and I never once looked back.

26:47.917 --> 26:51.542
Because it is not
my place in life to lead.

26:52.917 --> 26:57.083
If I turn that down,
how can I take on all this?

27:06.583 --> 27:09.000
A long time ago, G'Kar..

27:11.208 --> 27:14.958
...I told you that you had
an unfair advantage over me.

27:16.792 --> 27:19.750
I carry my sword in my hand.

27:19.833 --> 27:22.042
But you..

27:22.125 --> 27:24.542
...you carry your sword
in your heart

27:24.625 --> 27:27.917
where no one can
take it from you.

27:28.000 --> 27:32.292
I have an obligation
of honor to use mine.

27:32.375 --> 27:35.708
Do you not share that
obligation to use yours?

27:37.208 --> 27:39.583
To what end, Ta'lon?

27:39.667 --> 27:41.833
I have nothing to teach them.

27:41.917 --> 27:45.292
That is where you are wrong.

27:45.375 --> 27:49.500
For a hundred years, we have
taught ourselves one thing

27:49.583 --> 27:52.500
how to hate and how to fight.

27:54.458 --> 27:57.042
This is a new age, G'Kar.

27:57.125 --> 28:00.250
We have to learn other lessons.

28:00.333 --> 28:02.083
Our leaders back home

28:02.167 --> 28:05.125
they know only the old ways.

28:05.208 --> 28:07.875
But you have been
beyond and survived it

28:07.958 --> 28:10.542
and have come back
to teach us what it is like.

28:14.583 --> 28:19.000
I have not personally
read your book.

28:19.083 --> 28:22.917
I've never been
a very spiritual person.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.042
But I have seen
the light of understanding

28:26.125 --> 28:29.667
come into their eyes.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.375
It's not about
teaching something.

28:31.458 --> 28:35.250
It's about unlearning hatred
and unlearning fear.

28:39.542 --> 28:41.542
I am a warrior.

28:43.750 --> 28:46.375
I cannot teach them
these things.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.083
But you can.

28:55.875 --> 28:58.375
All my life..

28:58.458 --> 29:01.458
...I have been responsible
only for myself.

29:03.542 --> 29:05.958
When I risked, I risked alone..

29:06.042 --> 29:09.875
...to avoid making others pay
the price for my mistakes.

29:11.792 --> 29:13.917
They want me to show them
another way.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.375
What if I show them
the wrong way?

29:17.458 --> 29:20.625
What if they come to me not
because of the lesson

29:20.708 --> 29:23.000
but because of the teacher?

29:23.083 --> 29:26.500
I worry, Ta'lon,
that my shadow may become

29:26.583 --> 29:29.625
greater than the message.

29:29.708 --> 29:32.333
If that happens

29:32.417 --> 29:35.583
I give you my word
that I will personally kill you.

29:37.333 --> 29:40.750
And this is supposed to
put my mind at ease.

29:40.833 --> 29:42.500
I'm a warrior.

29:42.583 --> 29:44.833
It's what I have to give.

29:47.250 --> 29:50.292
You and I both have
our burdens to bear, G'Kar.

29:53.125 --> 29:55.417
I will carry mine..

29:58.250 --> 30:00.583
...if you will carry yours.

30:06.167 --> 30:08.083
[indistinct whispering]

30:08.167 --> 30:11.250
[instrumental music]

30:16.875 --> 30:19.792
That's all you brought back?

30:19.875 --> 30:22.000
During the fight,
it came off one of the guys

30:22.083 --> 30:23.458
who killed the pilot.

30:23.542 --> 30:25.250
But you have no idea
who they were

30:25.333 --> 30:27.750
even what race
they belonged to?

30:27.833 --> 30:31.083
It was dark,
they were cloaked.

30:31.167 --> 30:36.083
- I didn't see a thing.
- And your friend?

30:36.167 --> 30:38.125
He's dead.

30:38.208 --> 30:41.583
They got him
right outside my room.

30:41.667 --> 30:44.000
Well, I'm surprised
you didn't hear it.

30:44.083 --> 30:47.542
I was sleeping, it was a long
trip. I just conked out.

30:51.292 --> 30:53.458
My guess is that the Drazi
police wanted to get their

30:53.542 --> 30:56.708
hands on the pilot so they
could keep him from telling us

30:56.792 --> 30:58.167
about the illegal shipments.

30:58.250 --> 31:00.000
Tafiq wouldn't
tell them, so..

31:00.083 --> 31:02.417
Perhaps it was the Drazi
who killed the pilot.

31:02.500 --> 31:06.042
No. They weren't Drazi.
That much I know for sure.

31:06.125 --> 31:08.083
One, it hurts a hell of
a lot more to hit a Drazi

31:08.167 --> 31:10.250
than it did to hit these guys.

31:10.333 --> 31:12.125
And two, if the Drazi
had known that the pilot

31:12.208 --> 31:14.083
was coming to see us
they would've been downstairs

31:14.167 --> 31:17.083
not hanging around
waiting for me to run into them.

31:17.167 --> 31:22.000
And three, when the Drazi police
showed up, they just took off.

31:22.083 --> 31:23.917
No, these guys, they're..

31:24.000 --> 31:27.292
They're different,
different operation.

31:27.375 --> 31:29.292
Whoever killed the pilot..

31:29.375 --> 31:31.875
...they're the ones
behind these attacks.

31:31.958 --> 31:34.292
They knew the pilot was alive
and they killed him before

31:34.375 --> 31:38.292
we could bring him back to
testify about what he saw.

31:38.375 --> 31:40.625
They knew exactly
what we were trying to do.

31:40.708 --> 31:44.458
- Meaning we have a leak.
- Looks like.

31:44.542 --> 31:48.000
- Without the pilot--
- My apologies for being late.

31:48.083 --> 31:51.250
There was a most remarkable
problem with the transport tube.

31:51.333 --> 31:55.333
It dropped two floors
and then stopped suddenly.

31:55.417 --> 31:58.708
So there I was with
my feet around my ears

31:58.792 --> 32:02.542
admiring an entirely
new view of my inner self.

32:04.542 --> 32:07.333
(John)
'It's alright,
you didn't miss much.'

32:07.417 --> 32:10.375
'Is there anything you'd like
to add further, Michael?'

32:10.458 --> 32:12.708
- No, not really--
- Great maker.

32:12.792 --> 32:14.583
What happened to you?

32:14.667 --> 32:18.042
Don't ask for a raise.

32:18.125 --> 32:20.667
Where did you find this? Hm?

32:21.875 --> 32:24.167
- You know what this is?
- Of course.

32:24.250 --> 32:26.375
I've seen this all my life.

32:26.458 --> 32:29.042
Ever since I came
to the royal court, anyway.

32:29.125 --> 32:31.542
You won't find this
anywhere else.

32:31.625 --> 32:33.958
This is a..

32:34.042 --> 32:36.292
...button from
one of the uniforms

32:36.375 --> 32:38.792
'of our imperial palace guards.'

32:38.875 --> 32:43.208
And the design here,
is the seal of Emperor Tuscano

32:43.292 --> 32:46.792
who first commissioned
the palace guard 2000 years ago.

32:46.875 --> 32:49.042
Where did you get it?

32:49.125 --> 32:50.792
I got it down in the Zocalo.

32:50.875 --> 32:52.917
Guy said it was
real old and I thought

32:53.000 --> 32:54.917
it might be worth something.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
[chuckling]

32:57.083 --> 32:59.583
Well, then, as you
so colorfully say

32:59.667 --> 33:04.208
Mr. Garibaldi,
"You were taken...for a ride."

33:05.292 --> 33:08.333
So, what have I missed?

33:08.417 --> 33:10.375
Uh, Michael was just
filling us in

33:10.458 --> 33:13.083
on the results of his mission.

33:13.167 --> 33:15.000
And what did you find?

33:15.083 --> 33:17.625
Nothing at all.

33:17.708 --> 33:21.208
So, uh, let's move on
to the next subject of business.

33:21.292 --> 33:23.417
- Delenn?
- Of course.

33:23.500 --> 33:27.417
I didn't know what to say
at that point.

33:27.500 --> 33:30.917
I don't think we can
trust him anymore.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.708
We know now that
the Centauri are almost

33:32.792 --> 33:35.792
certainly involved
in these attacks.

33:35.875 --> 33:38.167
But Londo would have
not dropped that information

33:38.250 --> 33:40.000
in our laps if
he were involved.

33:40.083 --> 33:42.083
No, but on the other hand,

33:42.167 --> 33:43.583
he's most certainly responsible

33:43.667 --> 33:46.833
for the leak that
nearly got Michael killed.

33:46.917 --> 33:49.250
That makes sense though,
he's in almost daily contact

33:49.333 --> 33:51.375
with his government,
if he did have information

33:51.458 --> 33:53.583
about the attacks he might
mention it not knowing

33:53.667 --> 33:54.917
he was giving it
to the very people

33:55.000 --> 33:56.958
responsible for the whole
damn thing.

33:57.042 --> 33:59.417
It does answer
a lot of questions.

33:59.500 --> 34:01.167
Except this one, why?

34:01.250 --> 34:05.292
What do the Centauri have
to gain by these attacks?

34:05.375 --> 34:08.542
They're dividing the alliance,
making the members

34:08.625 --> 34:11.458
suspect each other,
divide and conquer.

34:11.542 --> 34:15.667
Except the Centauri need the
Alliance as much as anyone else.

34:15.750 --> 34:18.458
No, no, there's something here
that we're missing.

34:18.542 --> 34:20.667
Alright, so what're
we gonna do about it?

34:20.750 --> 34:22.250
Are we gonna tell
Londo what's going on

34:22.333 --> 34:23.708
and have him
find out for us?

34:23.792 --> 34:26.458
Or do we keep him completely
out of the equation?

34:26.542 --> 34:29.125
Tell him nothing.

34:29.208 --> 34:31.750
If you tell him what we know,
he'll be outraged.

34:31.833 --> 34:33.417
He'll do whatever's
necessary to track

34:33.500 --> 34:35.292
this problem
back to its source.

34:35.375 --> 34:36.958
And then very
shortly thereafter

34:37.042 --> 34:39.583
he will almost
certainly be dead.

34:39.667 --> 34:41.125
Why do you say that?

34:41.208 --> 34:43.292
We were attacked
on Centauri Prime

34:43.375 --> 34:46.667
by other Centauri
opposed to Mollari.

34:46.750 --> 34:50.333
At the last moment,
he was saved by an outside force

34:50.417 --> 34:53.167
one that seemed to have
the run of the palace.

34:53.250 --> 34:55.500
'This tells me that
there are two different forces'

34:55.583 --> 34:57.958
at work in the royal palace.

34:58.042 --> 35:00.708
So if the Centauri really
are behind these attacks

35:00.792 --> 35:04.708
one of these two
factions is involved.

35:04.792 --> 35:06.500
Mollari is alive
only because someone

35:06.583 --> 35:08.542
back home wants him that way.

35:08.625 --> 35:10.542
If he should begin asking
the wrong questions

35:10.625 --> 35:12.958
they would kill him
in an instant.

35:13.042 --> 35:15.875
No, until we know
which side is involved

35:15.958 --> 35:18.292
it's best to keep
Londo out of this.

35:18.375 --> 35:19.875
I agree.

35:19.958 --> 35:21.958
From here on out,
we tell Londo only

35:22.042 --> 35:24.333
what he needs to know,
and that's all.

35:24.417 --> 35:26.708
When is he due to return
to Centauri Prime?

35:26.792 --> 35:30.167
Four to six weeks, depending
on the health of the regent.

35:30.250 --> 35:33.042
- And you'll go with him?
- Where he goes, I go.

35:35.542 --> 35:37.042
Good.

35:37.125 --> 35:39.125
Keep an eye on him, G'Kar.

35:39.208 --> 35:42.208
He may be our only chance
to solve this thing.

35:42.292 --> 35:45.625
But I'd rather not do it
at the cost of his life.

35:45.708 --> 35:48.458
An eye is all
I have these days.

35:50.083 --> 35:51.958
(Dr. Franklin)
'Doctor's personal
journal continued.'

35:52.042 --> 35:54.708
'Sent word to Earthgov
to confirm the information'

35:54.792 --> 35:57.500
I received the other day.

35:57.583 --> 36:00.125
Confirmation came
in this afternoon.

36:04.167 --> 36:07.042
You know, the thing about
being a doctor is

36:07.125 --> 36:10.333
you learn how to deal
with all the hard questions.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.083
This one.

36:16.167 --> 36:18.000
This one is one of
the hardest

36:18.083 --> 36:20.875
I've had to deal with
in a long, long time.

36:25.292 --> 36:27.125
I think I've come
to a decision.

36:29.792 --> 36:33.458
One thing's for sure.

36:33.542 --> 36:35.875
I sure am gonna
miss this place.

36:44.667 --> 36:47.708
[instrumental music]

36:59.542 --> 37:03.833
In the past, we have had little
to do with other races.

37:03.917 --> 37:06.292
Evolution teaches us
that we must fight that

37:06.375 --> 37:09.208
which is different
in order to secure land

37:09.292 --> 37:12.792
food and mates for ourselves.

37:12.875 --> 37:16.958
'But we must reach a point
where the nobility of intellect'

37:17.042 --> 37:20.417
asserts itself and says no.

37:20.500 --> 37:23.167
We need not be afraid
of those who are different.

37:23.250 --> 37:26.917
We can embrace that difference
and learn from it.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.292
Most Holy.

37:29.375 --> 37:34.375
There is no "Most Holy" here,
there is only me.

37:34.458 --> 37:35.875
What is it?

37:35.958 --> 37:39.000
I understand
what you are saying.

37:39.083 --> 37:41.500
But in the book of G'Kar
it says that

37:41.583 --> 37:44.333
the Centauri
cannot be trusted.

37:44.417 --> 37:46.542
When was that written
in the book?

37:46.625 --> 37:49.167
- In the beginning.
- Exactly.

37:49.250 --> 37:53.792
Over time, I learned,
as you will learn.

37:53.875 --> 37:57.083
The book of G'Kar is holy.

37:57.167 --> 37:59.667
If it was written under
the direct inspiration

37:59.750 --> 38:02.792
of the universe itself
as everyone believes it to be

38:02.875 --> 38:06.000
then the whole of it
must be true.

38:06.083 --> 38:08.583
How then can you
go against it?

38:10.250 --> 38:12.625
Show me the passage
in the book.

38:20.417 --> 38:23.000
Good. Good, now..

38:24.708 --> 38:26.958
Put your face in the book.

38:30.167 --> 38:32.875
Well, if the book is holy and
I am holy

38:32.958 --> 38:34.875
then I must help you
become closer

38:34.958 --> 38:37.042
to the thoughts of the universe.

38:37.125 --> 38:39.500
Put your face in the book.

38:42.125 --> 38:43.625
The first thing
we are all taught

38:43.708 --> 38:46.250
is that while outsiders
cannot be trusted

38:46.333 --> 38:49.042
we can always trust
a fellow Narn, yes?

38:49.125 --> 38:51.708
This is your point, is it not?

38:53.208 --> 38:57.083
Good. Then put your
face in the book.

39:05.125 --> 39:07.125
[grunts]

39:08.000 --> 39:10.375
There's lesson number one.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.083
[instrumental music]

39:26.000 --> 39:27.583
Oh, Stephen.

39:27.667 --> 39:30.292
I'm sorry, come in.

39:32.667 --> 39:35.083
We missed you
at the meeting last night.

39:35.167 --> 39:36.792
Well, yeah, I..

39:36.875 --> 39:40.042
I had some things
I had to think about, but..

39:40.125 --> 39:41.417
Now that I've
come to a decision

39:41.500 --> 39:43.542
I wanted you to
be the first to know.

39:47.542 --> 39:49.208
Know what?

39:51.458 --> 39:52.958
I, uh..

39:54.417 --> 39:57.500
I got a call from
Dr. Benjamin Kyle

39:57.583 --> 40:00.917
head of xenobiological
research at Earth Dome.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.208
We've crossed paths here
and there over the years

40:04.292 --> 40:06.708
and he was even loaned out to B5
for a while when the place

40:06.792 --> 40:09.208
first went online
to troubleshoot

40:09.292 --> 40:10.917
the alien sector and work out

40:11.000 --> 40:13.500
the life-support systems,
analyze the..

40:17.208 --> 40:19.208
Anyway..

40:19.292 --> 40:20.833
I have a lot
of respect for his work

40:20.917 --> 40:24.500
and he has a lot
for mine and..

40:24.583 --> 40:29.083
Well, he's retiring
at the end of the year.

40:29.167 --> 40:32.417
That'll be a loss. I am familiar
with some of his work.

40:32.500 --> 40:35.083
He's brilliant.

40:35.167 --> 40:37.417
Be a hard act to follow.

40:37.500 --> 40:39.875
Yes, he is.

40:39.958 --> 40:42.667
And yes, he will be..

40:42.750 --> 40:45.292
...which is why I had
to think long and hard

40:45.375 --> 40:48.542
when he asked me
to take over for him.

40:52.917 --> 40:54.583
I thought you were
compiling data

40:54.667 --> 40:58.292
on alien disease transmission
for Delenn and the alliance.

40:58.375 --> 41:02.083
I am. And if anything,
this will make it easier.

41:02.167 --> 41:04.042
Earth Dome has a hell
of a lot more resources

41:04.125 --> 41:05.917
than we've got here.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.042
And I'd have
a huge staff and..

41:08.125 --> 41:10.083
With the alliance giving me
the authority to go

41:10.167 --> 41:12.667
where I need to put
this information together

41:12.750 --> 41:16.500
in a lot of ways,
i-it's a match made in heaven.

41:21.167 --> 41:25.375
On the other hand, it does mean
I'd have to leave here.

41:25.458 --> 41:28.958
Leave all the friends
that I've made here.

41:29.042 --> 41:32.583
And that made it a pretty
damn tough decision.

41:35.583 --> 41:37.958
But I've decided
to accept his offer.

41:41.750 --> 41:44.250
I see.

41:44.333 --> 41:46.125
(Dr. Franklin)
'And, it's not immediate.'

41:46.208 --> 41:48.333
I mean, like I said, Dr. Kyle
will stay on until the end

41:48.417 --> 41:52.375
of the year but effective
January 1, 2263

41:52.458 --> 41:53.583
I will be the new head of

41:53.667 --> 41:58.167
xenobiological research
at Earth Dome.

41:58.250 --> 41:59.458
Well, I would be
a liar if I said

41:59.542 --> 42:02.417
that I was happy
to hear this.

42:02.500 --> 42:05.917
'You are a valuable
member of the team.'

42:09.875 --> 42:12.833
You have saved all
of our necks so many times

42:12.917 --> 42:16.750
I don't even
want to think about it.

42:16.833 --> 42:19.250
And on a..

42:19.333 --> 42:23.042
...strictly personal level..

42:23.125 --> 42:25.292
...I value your friendship.

42:28.917 --> 42:32.167
But you..

42:32.250 --> 42:35.792
...do have to do
the right thing.

42:35.875 --> 42:37.292
Yeah.

42:38.458 --> 42:41.083
That's a hell of a promotion.

42:41.167 --> 42:43.542
- Congratulations, Stephen.
- Thank you.

42:46.583 --> 42:49.917
Would you like me
to tell Delenn?

42:50.000 --> 42:52.292
No, no, I'll do that.

42:52.375 --> 42:55.125
Then I'll just have to
tell everyone else.

42:55.208 --> 42:58.458
I think Garibaldi will
probably take it the hardest.

42:58.542 --> 43:01.917
Next to him, I've been here the
longest of anybody from Earth.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.125
I've got a call
in to him right now.

43:04.208 --> 43:06.250
[beeping]

43:10.083 --> 43:13.125
[instrumental music]

43:20.083 --> 43:23.125
[beeping continues]

43:32.125 --> 43:34.500
