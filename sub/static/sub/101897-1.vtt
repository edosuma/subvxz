WEBVTT

00:07.019 --> 00:07.089
(cheery music)

00:31.160 --> 00:34.170
(people chattering)

00:39.219 --> 00:41.289
But Darby needs somewhere to

00:39.219 --> 00:41.289
drive around

00:41.289 --> 00:43.259
with Tess, Kimber and Ben!

00:43.259 --> 00:46.280
Santa doesn't have enough Darby

00:43.259 --> 00:46.280
Dream Wagon's to give out.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.189
The workshop is backed up.

00:48.189 --> 00:51.000
It's right here in the catalog.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.259
Can't you just buy it for me,

00:51.000 --> 00:52.259
daddy?

00:52.259 --> 00:54.280
It's only 74.99.

00:55.060 --> 00:56.049
A steal.

00:56.049 --> 00:58.170
The Christmas tree skirt

00:56.049 --> 00:58.170
factory is closing.

00:58.170 --> 01:01.090
We have to save money until

00:58.170 --> 01:01.090
I can find another job.

01:01.090 --> 01:02.289
And my holiday ice sculpting job

01:02.289 --> 01:05.069
is dried up since the accident.

01:05.069 --> 01:08.159
But Holly, we promise, it'll

01:05.069 --> 01:08.159
still be a great Christmas.

01:08.159 --> 01:09.159
Cheer up, Holly.

01:09.159 --> 01:11.219
At least we still have each

01:09.159 --> 01:11.219
other, right?

01:16.269 --> 01:20.060
Dear Santa, this Christmas,

01:20.060 --> 01:23.170
all I want is for my parents

01:20.060 --> 01:23.170
to go away, that's it.

01:24.129 --> 01:25.219
Can you make that happen?

01:26.250 --> 01:29.019
Love, Holly Winters.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.259
(whimsical music)

01:44.009 --> 01:46.180
(ominous music)

01:50.140 --> 01:52.159
(intense music)

01:59.219 --> 02:01.230
Naughty or nice this year,

01:59.219 --> 02:01.230
little girl?

02:03.159 --> 02:05.239
I'm a grown ass woman, bitch.

02:05.239 --> 02:08.039
That is not Christmassy!

02:08.039 --> 02:09.159
What the?

02:09.159 --> 02:11.060
Come on!

02:11.060 --> 02:13.069
(intense music cont.)

02:53.060 --> 02:57.199
That's right, frozen fish

02:53.060 --> 02:57.199
was Chef Ho's secret sauce.

02:57.199 --> 03:00.259
The fraud was then arrested for

02:57.199 --> 03:00.259
assault.

03:00.259 --> 03:02.060
Ho has closed the doors today

03:02.060 --> 03:04.229
because of the scandal

03:02.060 --> 03:04.229
that was about to break.

03:04.229 --> 03:08.189
So Ho is no, longer.

03:08.189 --> 03:09.139
What a tragedy.

03:09.139 --> 03:10.139
I know, Dean.

03:10.139 --> 03:14.060
I just love, love, loved

03:10.139 --> 03:14.060
their crab leg tower.

03:14.060 --> 03:16.210
Where will we have our office

03:14.060 --> 03:16.210
Christmas party this year?

03:16.210 --> 03:19.020
Don't you mean holiday party?

03:20.009 --> 03:23.069
Please don't give me that war

03:20.009 --> 03:23.069
on Christmas face, Christie.

03:23.069 --> 03:24.030
Cut.

03:24.030 --> 03:26.099
Great show today, Dean and

03:24.030 --> 03:26.099
Christie.

03:26.099 --> 03:28.069
Can I speak to you for a moment,

03:26.099 --> 03:28.069
Holly?

03:28.069 --> 03:31.099
I just wish you were a little

03:28.069 --> 03:31.099
bit more like Christie.

03:31.099 --> 03:34.060
Christie is like a

03:31.099 --> 03:34.060
talking tube of lipstick.

03:34.060 --> 03:35.189
Yeah, she's also pregnant.

03:35.189 --> 03:36.229
It's Dean's.

03:37.250 --> 03:39.159
So I gotta dump her from the

03:37.250 --> 03:39.159
show.

03:39.159 --> 03:41.210
Pregnancies make people

03:39.159 --> 03:41.210
uncomfortable, especially me.

03:41.210 --> 03:43.150
Yeah but, Christie's always

03:41.210 --> 03:43.150
in front of that giant desk,

03:43.150 --> 03:44.219
no one will even know.

03:44.219 --> 03:45.250
But I will.

03:45.250 --> 03:48.240
And because you'll never

03:45.250 --> 03:48.240
succumb to having children,

03:48.240 --> 03:51.240
I want you to fill that empty

03:48.240 --> 03:51.240
chair.

03:51.240 --> 03:52.199
As anchorwoman?

03:52.199 --> 03:56.229
The, anchorwoman of Channel 6

03:52.199 --> 03:56.229
News.

03:56.229 --> 03:59.069
Well uh, what about my

03:56.229 --> 03:59.069
investigations?

03:59.069 --> 04:00.199
Do you wanna keep wearing your

03:59.069 --> 04:00.199
ugly wigs

04:00.199 --> 04:02.050
and playing undercover dress up?

04:02.050 --> 04:03.080
Or do you want to triple your

04:02.050 --> 04:03.080
salary?

04:03.080 --> 04:04.030
The second thing.

04:04.030 --> 04:04.219
I'm, I'm in.

04:04.219 --> 04:05.289
Not so fast, Connie Chung.

04:05.289 --> 04:09.050
Once you take that seat, you'll

04:05.289 --> 04:09.050
be the face of this station.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.159
Billboards, bus benches,

04:11.159 --> 04:14.050
even those annoying little

04:11.159 --> 04:14.050
screens in the back of cabs.

04:14.050 --> 04:15.120
Yeah.

04:14.050 --> 04:15.120
Image is everything,

04:15.120 --> 04:16.149
and yours sucks.

04:16.149 --> 04:18.000
Screw you, Kevin.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.279
But, I have a way for you to

04:18.000 --> 04:19.279
take

04:19.279 --> 04:22.120
that giant sack of coal out of

04:19.279 --> 04:22.120
your ass.

04:23.220 --> 04:25.129
You're headed to Ornaments,

04:25.129 --> 04:27.180
the Christmasiest town ever,

04:27.180 --> 04:29.040
to cover their annual

04:29.040 --> 04:31.110
Ornaments Festival of Christmas

04:29.040 --> 04:31.110
Wonders.

04:31.110 --> 04:33.019
All their parties and events.

04:33.019 --> 04:34.290
They even have a hot cocoa ho

04:33.019 --> 04:34.290
down.

04:34.290 --> 04:36.180
Whatever that means.

04:36.180 --> 04:37.230
And you'll be checking in

04:36.180 --> 04:37.230
nightly

04:37.230 --> 04:39.220
with Dean and prego Christie.

04:40.230 --> 04:42.060
And since you're from there,

04:42.060 --> 04:44.060
you'll give the story a hometown

04:42.060 --> 04:44.060
spin.

04:44.060 --> 04:45.290
Look, I appreciate the gesture,

04:45.290 --> 04:49.269
but I hate Ornaments and

04:45.290 --> 04:49.269
everything that it stands for.

04:49.269 --> 04:50.230
You mean Christmas?

04:50.230 --> 04:52.139
It celebrates the tacky

04:50.230 --> 04:52.139
commercialism

04:52.139 --> 04:53.060
of some like.

04:52.139 --> 04:53.060
- Oh my God.

04:53.060 --> 04:56.029
Miracle baby born in a barn.

04:56.029 --> 04:59.110
I am never, ever going home,

04:56.029 --> 04:59.110
okay?

04:59.110 --> 05:01.139
Ornaments will land you the

04:59.110 --> 05:01.139
dream job

05:01.139 --> 05:02.279
people would kill for.

05:02.279 --> 05:05.019
Plus, while you're there,

05:06.180 --> 05:07.240
maybe you'll fall in love.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.040
Yeah, okay.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.029
Love.

05:11.170 --> 05:12.189
Gross.

05:13.199 --> 05:16.110
I'm Holly Frost and you're

05:13.199 --> 05:16.110
watching Channel 6 News.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.220
Good evening, I'm Holly Frost

05:25.220 --> 05:27.220
and you're watching Channel 6

05:25.220 --> 05:27.220
News.

05:34.079 --> 05:37.079
(mysterious music)

05:41.090 --> 05:44.180
(sleigh bells ringing)

06:05.290 --> 06:08.139
(Holly sighs)

06:08.139 --> 06:11.139
Yeah, it's gonna be great.

06:15.220 --> 06:16.170
Trying to get to Ornaments

06:16.170 --> 06:19.110
before I have to be live on

06:16.170 --> 06:19.110
camera.

06:19.110 --> 06:20.240
SAM: I'm sorry I'm late.

06:21.189 --> 06:22.230
Thanks for all the help.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.019
(romantic music)

06:27.019 --> 06:27.290
I'm Sam.

06:29.250 --> 06:31.100
I'm your camera man.

06:31.100 --> 06:34.199
(record stopping)

06:34.199 --> 06:36.019
You know anything about

06:34.199 --> 06:36.019
Ornaments?

06:36.019 --> 06:37.060
Unfortunately.

06:38.090 --> 06:41.090
Boat loads of Christmas

06:38.090 --> 06:41.090
events happen there every year

06:41.090 --> 06:43.180
and idiot people from all over

06:41.090 --> 06:43.180
the country

06:43.180 --> 06:47.000
come to partake in a

06:43.180 --> 06:47.000
joyous time in the snow.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.060
That sounds fun.

06:48.060 --> 06:50.199
Yeah, it's not, trust.

06:50.199 --> 06:53.220
So um, who are they, your

06:50.199 --> 06:53.220
sisters?

06:54.180 --> 06:56.120
Those are my ladies.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.060
It's my wife Lacey and

06:56.120 --> 06:58.060
our daughter Taylor.

06:58.060 --> 06:59.019
Huh.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.120
Lacey passed last year.

07:01.149 --> 07:03.180
Oh, I'm so sorry.

07:03.180 --> 07:05.029
How?

07:05.029 --> 07:06.199
Cancer.

07:06.199 --> 07:07.250
Mm.

07:07.250 --> 07:08.209
What kind?

07:10.120 --> 07:12.009
Cancer.

07:12.009 --> 07:13.209
Oh, right.

07:12.009 --> 07:13.209
Yeah.

07:15.100 --> 07:18.000
Let's just uh, get this

07:15.100 --> 07:18.000
over with, shall we?

07:18.290 --> 07:20.129
All right.

07:18.290 --> 07:20.129
I'm gonna take a--

07:20.129 --> 07:21.189
Buckle up.

07:21.189 --> 07:23.160
Quick nap.

07:23.160 --> 07:26.100
(cheerful music)

07:46.040 --> 07:47.220
(ominous music)

07:47.220 --> 07:50.029
(Holly gasping)

07:50.029 --> 07:51.220
Whoa, are you okay?

07:52.269 --> 07:54.139
Yeah, yeah yeah, it's fine.

07:54.139 --> 07:55.240
What is it?

07:55.240 --> 07:57.189
We made it to Ornaments.

07:57.189 --> 07:58.250
(Christmas bells ringing)

07:58.250 --> 07:59.220
Sick.

08:00.220 --> 08:03.160
(cheerful music)

08:04.290 --> 08:06.000
All right.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.279
Okay, I'll go fetch

08:07.120 --> 08:08.279
the rooms to the hotel.

08:08.279 --> 08:11.089
Maybe you can uh, score some

08:08.279 --> 08:11.089
coffee?

08:11.089 --> 08:13.079
Something festive.

08:13.079 --> 08:16.019
(cheerful music)

08:24.180 --> 08:25.139
Shit.

08:27.189 --> 08:30.100
(cheerful music)

08:30.100 --> 08:32.029
Oh, Jesus dude.

08:32.029 --> 08:32.289
Oh my God!

08:38.000 --> 08:38.259
Bonjour, madam.

08:38.259 --> 08:39.210
Hi.

08:39.210 --> 08:40.179
BARISTA: What can we get you

08:39.210 --> 08:40.179
today?

08:40.179 --> 08:43.029
Um,

08:43.029 --> 08:47.250
two La Prancer's peppermint

08:43.029 --> 08:47.250
mocha latte's.

08:47.250 --> 08:49.049
Okay, coming right up.

08:49.049 --> 08:50.110
Great.

08:50.110 --> 08:53.070
Hey listen, you don't have

08:50.110 --> 08:53.070
any booze back there, do you?

08:54.029 --> 08:54.279
Uh.

08:54.279 --> 08:56.039
Whatever kind, really.

08:56.039 --> 08:58.090
(barista laughs)

08:58.090 --> 08:59.059
You're funny.

08:59.059 --> 09:00.039
Yeah, I wasn't.

09:02.100 --> 09:03.059
Nevermind.

09:04.100 --> 09:05.289
Go, make the latte's.

09:07.009 --> 09:11.159
Holly, Winters, is that you?

09:11.159 --> 09:14.289
Uh, it's actually Holly Frost

09:11.159 --> 09:14.289
now, Danica.

09:14.289 --> 09:16.080
Where's the ring?

09:16.080 --> 09:18.049
Oh I didn't, I didn't get

09:16.080 --> 09:18.049
married,

09:18.049 --> 09:19.049
I just changed my name.

09:19.049 --> 09:23.259
From Winters to Frost, but why?

09:23.259 --> 09:25.110
They're basically the same

09:23.259 --> 09:25.110
thing.

09:25.110 --> 09:26.259
Nope, they're not.

09:26.259 --> 09:29.269
Well, I'm actually married.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.269
And get this,

09:31.220 --> 09:33.110
I'm the Mayor now.

09:33.110 --> 09:34.149
It's crazy, right?

09:34.149 --> 09:35.279
(Danica laughs)

09:34.149 --> 09:35.279
Hm.

09:35.279 --> 09:39.179
Today, I am giving back to our

09:35.279 --> 09:39.179
community.

09:40.120 --> 09:42.279
Did you want me to wrap anything

09:40.120 --> 09:42.279
for you?

09:42.279 --> 09:45.220
Oh, just your sweet little

09:42.279 --> 09:45.220
mouth.

09:45.220 --> 09:48.220
I see you're just the

09:45.220 --> 09:48.220
same old Grinchy Holly.

09:48.220 --> 09:49.200
Oh no, come on, look.

09:49.200 --> 09:51.269
I can be cordial.

09:51.269 --> 09:56.289
Like how is your hot cousin?

09:59.029 --> 10:02.179
Oh, you mean my cousin Chris

09:59.029 --> 10:02.179
Pringle.

10:02.179 --> 10:05.289
The one who you dumped

10:02.179 --> 10:05.289
via IM on graduation day?

10:05.289 --> 10:07.190
No that you would care,

10:07.190 --> 10:10.230
but Chris has actually been

10:07.190 --> 10:10.230
through a lot recently.

10:10.230 --> 10:12.070
He just lost his wife.

10:13.039 --> 10:16.019
Hopefully not to, cancer.

10:16.019 --> 10:16.269
Hot air balloon.

10:16.269 --> 10:18.019
Like it caught on fire?

10:18.019 --> 10:19.090
No.

10:19.090 --> 10:20.179
One fell on her.

10:20.179 --> 10:21.259
Holly.

10:21.259 --> 10:22.259
Your latte's are ready.

10:22.259 --> 10:23.200
Oh, great.

10:25.220 --> 10:30.090
Hey, these uh, bows could use

10:25.220 --> 10:30.090
a little work there, Mayor.

10:30.090 --> 10:31.250
Pretty uh, limp.

10:34.090 --> 10:35.059
It's not limp.

10:36.190 --> 10:37.159
Hotel's sold out.

10:37.159 --> 10:40.019
Yeah, since it's the 75th

10:37.159 --> 10:40.019
anniversary,

10:40.019 --> 10:42.029
everything's booked.

10:42.029 --> 10:43.090
But I got a better idea.

10:43.090 --> 10:45.029
I can just put a blow up in

10:43.090 --> 10:45.029
the back of the van and uh,

10:45.029 --> 10:46.120
I'll sleep in the front seat.

10:46.120 --> 10:47.179
It's not necessary.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.080
I have a place we can stay.

10:51.019 --> 10:53.259
(cheerful music)

10:58.029 --> 10:59.009
Oh, Holly!

10:59.279 --> 11:02.120
Son of a nutcracker,

10:59.279 --> 11:02.120
you're really here!

11:02.120 --> 11:05.080
This is magical, wow.

11:05.080 --> 11:07.289
(ominous music)

11:14.090 --> 11:15.100
- Hi!

11:14.090 --> 11:15.100
- Hi.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.289
Okay, yeah, all right.

11:17.289 --> 11:19.049
Oh, you're really shaking there.

11:19.049 --> 11:20.240
Okay, that's quite enough.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.210
Oh my gosh.

11:21.210 --> 11:22.159
Let me look at you.

11:22.159 --> 11:24.070
Just, wow.

11:24.070 --> 11:27.100
My little sister, the big

11:24.070 --> 11:27.100
city TV star in the flesh.

11:27.100 --> 11:30.139
I just, oh hi.

11:30.139 --> 11:31.179
Is that your boyfriend?

11:31.179 --> 11:33.059
No, it's my camera man.

11:33.059 --> 11:34.100
His name is Sam.

11:34.100 --> 11:35.230
Camera man Sam.

11:35.230 --> 11:36.169
Camera man Sam.

11:36.169 --> 11:38.049
That is fun to say.

11:38.049 --> 11:39.039
I'm Cookie.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.039
Oh, Hol, I'm just so tickled

11:40.100 --> 11:42.039
you're back.

11:42.039 --> 11:43.200
We have so much catching up to

11:42.039 --> 11:43.200
do.

11:43.200 --> 11:46.090
We can wrap gifts and sip cider

11:43.200 --> 11:46.090
and oh,

11:46.090 --> 11:49.250
we can cook a holiday beef

11:46.090 --> 11:49.250
brisket on Christmas night.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.159
Yeah, no.

11:50.159 --> 11:52.070
I leave first thing on the 25th.

11:52.070 --> 11:54.149
I'm just, I'm just here for

11:52.070 --> 11:54.149
work.

11:54.149 --> 11:55.110
Oh.

11:56.190 --> 11:57.139
Boo.

11:57.139 --> 12:00.070
Well, I will take what I can

11:57.139 --> 12:00.070
get, so.

12:00.070 --> 12:01.090
That's great.

12:01.090 --> 12:02.269
How bout some of that cider?

12:02.269 --> 12:03.250
I have so much cider.

12:03.250 --> 12:05.289
I have three different flavors

12:03.250 --> 12:05.289
of cider.

12:05.289 --> 12:08.009
I have nutmeg cider,

12:05.289 --> 12:08.009
which is crazy, I know.

12:08.009 --> 12:10.250
(cheerful music)

12:15.090 --> 12:16.179
There it is, just like you left

12:15.090 --> 12:16.179
it.

12:16.179 --> 12:18.059
Not really.

12:18.059 --> 12:19.259
What is all this shit doing in

12:18.059 --> 12:19.259
here?

12:19.259 --> 12:21.250
Oh, I turned the attic

12:21.250 --> 12:24.210
into my Christmas sweater sewing

12:21.250 --> 12:24.210
studio.

12:25.250 --> 12:27.129
Okay.

12:27.129 --> 12:28.289
Holly, I really wish

12:28.289 --> 12:31.100
you'd reconsider leaving

12:28.289 --> 12:31.100
Christmas morning.

12:31.100 --> 12:33.110
It would mean a lot to have

12:31.100 --> 12:33.110
you here for the holiday.

12:33.110 --> 12:37.120
You know, spend some quality

12:33.110 --> 12:37.120
time with family, with me.

12:37.120 --> 12:42.000
Yeah, I um, I really gotta

12:37.120 --> 12:42.000
get ready for the story, so.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.149
Hey, I can take a hint.

12:48.009 --> 12:50.179
(tense music)

12:56.279 --> 13:00.049
(light bells ringing)

13:02.019 --> 13:02.279
Mm.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.169
(Holly laughs)

13:07.169 --> 13:08.179
Oh, so cute.

13:16.139 --> 13:19.049
(ominous music)

13:26.139 --> 13:27.190
Dear Satan?

13:27.190 --> 13:30.029
(dark music)

13:48.019 --> 13:49.129
I wrote Satan.

13:51.269 --> 13:54.210
(cheerful music)

13:57.210 --> 13:58.240
Greetings.

13:58.240 --> 14:00.250
Chad Pringle and?

14:00.250 --> 14:01.279
Joy Wreath.

14:01.279 --> 14:06.029
O-M-Gingerbread, I heard

14:01.279 --> 14:06.029
rumors she was back in town.

14:06.029 --> 14:07.289
Is the famous Holly Winters

14:07.289 --> 14:09.080
really sitting with us

14:07.289 --> 14:09.080
right now?

14:09.080 --> 14:10.159
It's Holly Frost now.

14:10.159 --> 14:12.000
Oh, you got married.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.080
Why does everyone keep asking me

14:12.000 --> 14:14.080
that?

14:14.080 --> 14:15.230
I love the blazer.

14:15.230 --> 14:19.210
Coral, or is it more tangerine?

14:19.210 --> 14:21.090
It's definitely tangerine.

14:21.090 --> 14:23.100
I wish I could wear something so

14:21.090 --> 14:23.100
bold.

14:23.100 --> 14:27.000
My boss doesn't like me in

14:23.100 --> 14:27.000
anything but muted tones.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.110
And always a turtleneck.

14:28.110 --> 14:31.049
Mm, boss sounds like

14:28.110 --> 14:31.049
a controlling asshole.

14:31.049 --> 14:32.159
It's cousin Danica.

14:32.159 --> 14:33.070
Oh.

14:33.070 --> 14:34.019
Oh, Joy's the Mayor's assistant.

14:34.019 --> 14:37.149
And, I'm working for your aunt

14:34.019 --> 14:37.149
now.

14:37.149 --> 14:39.110
Aunt Becky's still alive?

14:39.110 --> 14:40.100
After years of consuming

14:40.100 --> 14:43.190
all that butter and

14:40.100 --> 14:43.190
sugar by the truckload.

14:43.190 --> 14:45.159
Holly was always such a kidder.

14:45.159 --> 14:48.009
My funny, fabulous bestie.

14:48.009 --> 14:50.070
And then she dumped me

14:48.009 --> 14:50.070
and my brother Chris

14:50.070 --> 14:54.120
and all of Ornaments for

14:50.070 --> 14:54.120
bigger and brighter things.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.159
Not that I'm still

14:54.120 --> 14:56.159
totally devastated by it.

14:56.159 --> 14:57.250
Well, I mean, what?

15:00.039 --> 15:02.279
(romantic music)

15:06.269 --> 15:08.129
Chad,

15:08.129 --> 15:09.100
and Holly.

15:12.149 --> 15:13.169
Chris.

15:14.159 --> 15:15.279
Sup.

15:15.279 --> 15:19.059
Wow, Christmas came early.

15:19.059 --> 15:19.259
Yeah.

15:21.080 --> 15:23.259
Uh, we'll see you both later?

15:23.259 --> 15:26.110
At the bakery, for letters to

15:23.259 --> 15:26.110
Santa?

15:26.110 --> 15:27.100
Yeah.

15:27.100 --> 15:32.070
Um, uh, maybe um, after

15:27.100 --> 15:32.070
my gig we could uh,

15:32.070 --> 15:34.110
uh, catch up, you know.

15:34.110 --> 15:36.080
Grab dinner or something.

15:36.080 --> 15:38.070
Yeah Hol, I'd really love that.

15:38.070 --> 15:39.029
Cool.

15:40.029 --> 15:42.080
(girl gasps)

15:42.080 --> 15:44.039
Who's the pretty lady, daddy?

15:44.039 --> 15:45.080
Oh Faith, I'd like you

15:44.039 --> 15:45.080
to meet my old friend.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.230
This is Holly.

15:46.230 --> 15:48.080
You have a kid?

15:48.080 --> 15:50.120
He does indeed, hi.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.240
What are you asking Santa for

15:50.120 --> 15:51.240
this year?

15:51.240 --> 15:53.129
Excuse me?

15:53.129 --> 15:54.029
Santa.

15:55.169 --> 15:57.220
What do you want for Christmas?

15:57.220 --> 15:59.110
I don't see a ring on that

15:57.220 --> 15:59.110
finger,

15:59.110 --> 16:01.240
so perhaps to land a husband.

16:01.240 --> 16:02.149
(Holly laughs cynically)

16:02.149 --> 16:04.230
Maybe you should ask your daddy

16:04.230 --> 16:07.009
for a reality check on both this

16:04.230 --> 16:07.009
year.

16:07.009 --> 16:08.110
What?

16:08.110 --> 16:10.269
You don't believe in love or

16:08.110 --> 16:10.269
Santa?

16:12.289 --> 16:15.120
I mean what is the point of

16:12.289 --> 16:15.120
living?

16:15.120 --> 16:17.080
It's almost six, Holly.

16:17.080 --> 16:18.120
We gotta start setting up.

16:18.120 --> 16:19.070
Oh, thank Christ.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.149
Um, well we'll make a plan later

16:21.000 --> 16:23.149
then?

16:23.149 --> 16:25.090
Yeah, I uh,

16:25.090 --> 16:28.009
I don't really think I'm

16:25.090 --> 16:28.009
gonna be hungry, but thanks.

16:30.169 --> 16:31.259
Santa is real, sweetie.

16:33.240 --> 16:37.029
(sleigh bells ringing)

16:38.269 --> 16:42.190
I spy my big city successful

16:38.269 --> 16:42.190
niece!

16:43.230 --> 16:45.100
Aunt Becky?

16:45.100 --> 16:46.240
Is Rudolph's nose red?

16:46.240 --> 16:48.259
(Aunt Becky laughs)

16:48.259 --> 16:49.169
Oh, hello.

16:51.049 --> 16:53.230
You must be Holly's main

16:51.049 --> 16:53.230
squeeze.

16:53.230 --> 16:54.179
Uh.

16:54.179 --> 16:56.190
Call me Aunt Becky, everyone

16:54.179 --> 16:56.190
does.

16:56.190 --> 16:58.289
Are you sure that you're my Aunt

16:56.190 --> 16:58.289
Becky?

16:58.289 --> 17:00.000
I mean the last time I saw her

16:58.289 --> 17:00.000
she was--

17:00.000 --> 17:00.250
Round?

17:00.250 --> 17:01.250
Big, plump.

17:01.250 --> 17:02.200
(Aunt Becky laughs)

17:02.200 --> 17:03.149
Yeah.

17:03.149 --> 17:06.029
I lost 162 pounds this past

17:03.149 --> 17:06.029
winter.

17:06.029 --> 17:07.009
Jesus.

17:07.009 --> 17:08.190
Well I definitely prayed to him

17:07.009 --> 17:08.190
about it.

17:08.190 --> 17:09.190
But what really melted

17:09.190 --> 17:12.250
that stubborn fat away

17:09.190 --> 17:12.250
was a change in diet.

17:12.250 --> 17:16.059
I used to constantly

17:12.250 --> 17:16.059
taste test my cookies.

17:16.059 --> 17:18.200
But then I started to

17:16.059 --> 17:18.200
play a game with myself.

17:18.200 --> 17:21.200
I would give them all names.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.190
Like my little cookie children.

17:23.190 --> 17:25.240
I wouldn't eat my children.

17:26.200 --> 17:29.049
Okay, so what about the

17:26.200 --> 17:29.049
people who do eat them?

17:30.259 --> 17:31.210
Don't mind if I do.

17:31.210 --> 17:33.200
Hey, get your.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.039
So why are you dressed like

17:33.200 --> 17:35.039
you're

17:35.039 --> 17:36.289
about to service a fruitcake?

17:36.289 --> 17:39.170
Well this is my caroling

17:36.289 --> 17:39.170
costume, thank you for asking.

17:39.170 --> 17:42.039
I'm on my way to rehearsal right

17:39.170 --> 17:42.039
now.

17:42.039 --> 17:43.059
Oh sweetie, you should come.

17:43.059 --> 17:45.089
You've always had the most

17:43.059 --> 17:45.089
beautiful singing voice.

17:45.089 --> 17:46.250
Yeah, it was kind of millennial.

17:46.250 --> 17:48.079
Debbie!

17:48.079 --> 17:49.039
Oh, here, can you hold this.

17:49.039 --> 17:50.130
Debbie.

17:49.039 --> 17:50.130
I don't wanna.

17:50.130 --> 17:53.150
Alcohol, where is the alcohol.

17:53.150 --> 17:55.099
(tray slamming)

17:55.099 --> 17:57.250
So uh, where's Chris?

17:57.250 --> 18:00.119
Chris is with my brother,

17:57.250 --> 18:00.119
the sheriff,

18:00.119 --> 18:01.210
over on Quinton Avenue.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.170
Chris spotted some vaping teens

18:04.170 --> 18:07.069
trespassing on Goldman's

18:04.170 --> 18:07.069
property

18:07.069 --> 18:08.069
hooking up Christmas lights.

18:08.069 --> 18:11.029
Personally I think they

18:08.069 --> 18:11.029
were doing them a favor.

18:11.029 --> 18:12.220
They are the only house on the

18:11.029 --> 18:12.220
street

18:12.220 --> 18:14.069
without any Christmas lights.

18:14.069 --> 18:17.009
People are allowed to be

18:14.069 --> 18:17.009
Jewish in Ornaments, Danica.

18:18.250 --> 18:19.259
I never said that.

18:22.019 --> 18:23.259
See y'all on TV.

18:23.259 --> 18:25.029
Let's do this.

18:25.029 --> 18:25.289
All right.

18:25.289 --> 18:27.029
Okay, here we go.

18:28.130 --> 18:30.119
Smile, smile, smile.

18:30.119 --> 18:34.079
CAMERA MAN: Live in three, two,

18:30.119 --> 18:34.079
one.

18:34.079 --> 18:36.210
It is such a joy to watch these

18:34.079 --> 18:36.210
faces

18:36.210 --> 18:39.279
jot down what they might like

18:36.210 --> 18:39.279
from Santa.

18:39.279 --> 18:44.039
I'll be back here tomorrow

18:39.279 --> 18:44.039
night for the hot cocoa ho-down.

18:44.039 --> 18:45.009

18:52.079 --> 18:54.009
CAMERA MAN: Awesome.

18:54.289 --> 18:56.269
Here, let me get you a glass.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.000
Don't worry about it.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.089
I'm just gonna drink from

18:58.000 --> 19:01.089
the bottle, but thanks.

19:06.140 --> 19:07.109
I'll,

19:08.190 --> 19:09.190
I'll be right back.

19:11.119 --> 19:12.079
Greetings.

19:17.210 --> 19:21.019
Dear Satan,

19:21.019 --> 19:25.049
it's been 21, scratch that.

19:25.049 --> 19:28.069
22 years.

19:28.069 --> 19:32.089
Thanks for ruining Christmas,

19:28.069 --> 19:32.089
dick.

19:32.089 --> 19:35.289
You can keep it.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.009
Screw you.

19:43.269 --> 19:48.279
Sincerely, not yours.

19:48.279 --> 19:51.180
Holly Frost.

19:56.150 --> 19:59.069
(magical music)

20:13.269 --> 20:14.240
Hey uh,

20:16.039 --> 20:20.089
do you wanna show me the back of

20:16.039 --> 20:20.089
your van?

20:20.089 --> 20:21.109
Uh.

20:20.089 --> 20:21.109
Come on.

20:23.200 --> 20:26.190
(mysterious music)

20:30.289 --> 20:32.059
Business.

20:34.210 --> 20:35.180
Casual.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.150
Take off your pants.

20:38.150 --> 20:41.000
I have to take off the shoes

20:38.150 --> 20:41.000
first.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.180
But shouldn't we like just start

20:41.000 --> 20:42.180
kissing?

20:42.180 --> 20:44.150
Oh, there's gonna be absolutely

20:46.160 --> 20:47.119
no kissing.

20:49.220 --> 20:50.119
Okay.

20:50.119 --> 20:52.099
Let me help you with those.

20:52.099 --> 20:53.059
Really?

20:59.009 --> 21:00.049
What's wrong?

21:00.289 --> 21:02.269
It's not you.

21:02.269 --> 21:03.210
It's that.

21:03.210 --> 21:04.279
(ominous music)

21:04.279 --> 21:05.269
It's my wife.

21:06.240 --> 21:09.029
I'm not sure I'm ready to do

21:06.240 --> 21:09.029
this to her.

21:10.029 --> 21:10.240
Okay.

21:10.240 --> 21:11.230
To be honest, we should just.

21:11.230 --> 21:13.099
I mean, try to keep

21:11.230 --> 21:13.099
this thing professional.

21:13.099 --> 21:14.099
Professional.

21:14.099 --> 21:17.039
That's how I ended up

21:14.099 --> 21:17.039
in the back of your van.

21:17.039 --> 21:18.059
With my top off.

21:18.059 --> 21:22.109
By both of us keeping

21:18.059 --> 21:22.109
things super professional.

21:22.109 --> 21:23.059
We've got.

21:23.059 --> 21:25.210
Oh, and by the way,

21:25.210 --> 21:29.039
your earring is super lame.

21:29.039 --> 21:30.160
Where did you get it?

21:30.160 --> 21:31.279
Hot Topic?

21:32.230 --> 21:33.279
My daughter.

21:33.279 --> 21:36.029
My daughter got me this.

21:36.029 --> 21:39.019
(melancholy music)

21:41.089 --> 21:42.210
And I'm drunk.

21:44.170 --> 21:48.099
♪ Four golden rings ♪

21:48.099 --> 21:50.039
♪ Three ♪

21:56.250 --> 21:58.089
(tires screeching)

21:58.089 --> 21:59.130
Woo!

21:59.130 --> 22:00.289
Party rocking.

22:00.289 --> 22:03.240
Coming in and I'm a--

22:03.240 --> 22:04.230
Ah, bummer!

22:06.069 --> 22:09.059

22:16.230 --> 22:17.230
(loud banging on van)

22:17.230 --> 22:19.109
Whoa!

22:19.109 --> 22:20.099
What the hell?

22:20.099 --> 22:23.190
(loud slamming on van)

22:25.130 --> 22:26.079
Okay.

22:27.240 --> 22:29.130
Uh, all right.

22:29.130 --> 22:32.089
(Holly screaming)

22:33.259 --> 22:35.109
(sirens blaring)

22:35.109 --> 22:36.130
Pull over, ma'am.

22:36.130 --> 22:37.259
Pull over.

22:37.259 --> 22:40.019
Great, the pigs here to ruin the

22:37.259 --> 22:40.019
fun.

22:40.019 --> 22:41.039
Ma'am, put your hands up.

22:41.039 --> 22:42.240
Don't flipping ma'am me.

22:42.240 --> 22:46.039
I am only 27 years old.

22:46.039 --> 22:47.200
Turn around, ma'am.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.009
Quit calling me--

22:49.009 --> 22:51.269
(romantic music)

22:51.269 --> 22:54.019
Hello, sailor.

22:54.019 --> 22:56.039
(slamming on van)

22:56.039 --> 22:58.190
Hi, hi, uh yeah there's

22:56.039 --> 22:58.190
something on the roof of my van

22:58.190 --> 23:00.220
and it seems pretty angry and

22:58.190 --> 23:00.220
uh.

23:00.220 --> 23:02.099
I, I don't know what it is.

23:02.099 --> 23:04.089
It could be a large person or a

23:02.099 --> 23:04.089
moose.

23:05.049 --> 23:06.059
No this isn't a joke.

23:06.059 --> 23:07.119
Hello?

23:07.119 --> 23:08.079
Hello?

23:08.079 --> 23:09.289
Ma'am, have you been drinking,

23:08.079 --> 23:09.289
ma'am?

23:09.289 --> 23:10.240
What are you gonna do?

23:10.240 --> 23:13.009
Breatheralyze me for ridin'

23:10.240 --> 23:13.009
around

23:13.009 --> 23:15.019
in a little bitty kids toy?

23:15.019 --> 23:16.170
Technically, you were driving.

23:16.170 --> 23:17.240
So we're gonna need to see some

23:16.170 --> 23:17.240
ID.

23:17.240 --> 23:19.160
Hm, okay.

23:19.160 --> 23:22.160
Well how bout I see your ID's,

23:19.160 --> 23:22.160
huh?

23:23.170 --> 23:24.269
I'm Sheriff Wreath.

23:24.269 --> 23:25.250
Hm.

23:25.250 --> 23:26.269
This is Deputy Wreath.

23:26.269 --> 23:30.000
You guys don't happen to

23:26.269 --> 23:30.000
be related to Joy, do you?

23:30.000 --> 23:32.059
Why, 'cause we're the

23:30.000 --> 23:32.059
only black people in town?

23:32.059 --> 23:35.009
Because your last name's are

23:32.059 --> 23:35.009
both Wreath.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.069
We're brothers.

23:37.069 --> 23:38.170
Joy's our sister.

23:38.170 --> 23:40.119
Sexy siblings.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.059
Bet your parents are pretty hot,

23:42.000 --> 23:44.059
too.

23:45.279 --> 23:46.250
They're dead.

23:48.019 --> 23:49.099
Samezies.

23:49.099 --> 23:50.059
Hello?

23:51.009 --> 23:53.220
(ominous music)

24:03.140 --> 24:06.089
(engine choking)

24:06.089 --> 24:08.009
(tense music)

24:08.009 --> 24:09.230
So is Aunt Becky your real aunt?

24:09.230 --> 24:10.210
Mm-hm.

24:10.210 --> 24:12.289
'Cause her angel cookies are the

24:10.210 --> 24:12.289
bomb.com.

24:12.289 --> 24:15.079
Nerd alert.

24:15.079 --> 24:16.160
Pretty hot nerd, though.

24:18.039 --> 24:19.019
Deputy.

24:19.019 --> 24:20.210
Sorry, um.

24:20.210 --> 24:23.009
Look, we're gonna let you

24:20.210 --> 24:23.009
off with just a warning.

24:23.009 --> 24:23.250
(Holly gasps)

24:23.250 --> 24:25.029
But that's only 'cause of Aunt

24:23.250 --> 24:25.029
B.

24:25.029 --> 24:28.230
She's been real supportive of

24:25.029 --> 24:28.230
us, less experienced singers.

24:28.230 --> 24:30.190
Oh God, you're a caroler?

24:30.190 --> 24:32.019
When in Ornaments, right?

24:32.019 --> 24:36.029
Well, gentlemen, it is getting

24:32.019 --> 24:36.029
late

24:36.029 --> 24:37.230
and it has been a pleasure.

24:39.089 --> 24:42.200
But I will see you later.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.269
Have a lovely evening.

24:45.029 --> 24:45.279
(engine choking)

24:45.279 --> 24:46.240
Come on!

24:49.279 --> 24:52.190
(ominous music)

24:54.170 --> 24:55.130
No.

24:57.019 --> 24:58.180
No no no no no no.

24:58.180 --> 24:59.269
No no no no no!

25:02.170 --> 25:03.200
(glass shattering)

25:02.170 --> 25:03.200
Whoa!

25:03.200 --> 25:04.230
(camera man screaming)

25:04.230 --> 25:06.079
Help me, please, no!

25:06.079 --> 25:08.240
(Satan Claus growling)

25:08.240 --> 25:10.089
SATAN CLAUS: Hot Topic.

25:10.089 --> 25:12.289
(intense music)

25:21.160 --> 25:22.130
God.

25:25.059 --> 25:26.019
Yes.

25:29.019 --> 25:30.269
Sam, come on, we gotta go.

25:30.269 --> 25:34.150
I need some caffeine before

25:30.269 --> 25:34.150
this sad hot cocoa ho-down.

25:35.240 --> 25:37.150
Come on Sam, giddy-up, let's go.

25:37.150 --> 25:40.130
Don't care if you're

25:37.150 --> 25:40.130
naked, I am coming in.

25:40.130 --> 25:41.089
Woo!

25:43.150 --> 25:45.069
Yeah I've called Sam like 100

25:43.150 --> 25:45.069
times

25:45.069 --> 25:46.089
and the news van is gone.

25:46.089 --> 25:48.009
I need you to send me

25:46.089 --> 25:48.009
another camera man, ASAP.

25:48.009 --> 25:50.220
Preferably one without a dead

25:48.009 --> 25:50.220
wife.

25:50.220 --> 25:51.130
No, there's no time, Holly.

25:51.130 --> 25:52.119
If Sam doesn't resurface soon,

25:52.119 --> 25:54.170
just find a townie with camera

25:52.119 --> 25:54.170
experience.

25:54.170 --> 25:55.240
Oh, by the way,

25:55.240 --> 25:58.119
the audience seemed to buy what

25:55.240 --> 25:58.119
you were selling last night.

25:58.119 --> 25:59.279
So keep it up.

25:59.279 --> 26:01.109
(Holly sighs)

26:01.109 --> 26:03.089
Want to knit a Christmas sweater

26:01.109 --> 26:03.089
with me?

26:05.069 --> 26:09.150
I'm thinking maybe a cat riding

26:05.069 --> 26:09.150
a dog who's on a reindeer.

26:10.130 --> 26:13.059
And, they're all in Santa hats.

26:14.230 --> 26:16.240
As super fun and creative as

26:14.230 --> 26:16.240
that sounds,

26:16.240 --> 26:18.289
I need to find somebody who

26:16.240 --> 26:18.289
knows how to work a camera

26:18.289 --> 26:21.069
for tonight's segment

26:18.289 --> 26:21.069
because that sexy loser

26:21.069 --> 26:23.140
with the stupid sexy earring is

26:21.069 --> 26:23.140
MIA.

26:23.140 --> 26:24.220
Oh well what about Chris

26:23.140 --> 26:24.220
Pringle?

26:24.220 --> 26:26.109
When he's not selling Christmas

26:24.220 --> 26:26.109
trees,

26:26.109 --> 26:28.240
he's teaching videography

26:26.109 --> 26:28.240
at Ornaments High.

26:28.240 --> 26:30.069
And he's also single.

26:32.019 --> 26:35.019
My, my ex with the

26:32.019 --> 26:35.019
bizarro teen child, right.

26:36.009 --> 26:39.210
But I mean, what choice do

26:36.009 --> 26:39.210
I have?

26:39.210 --> 26:40.269
Oh, choose love.

26:42.019 --> 26:44.049
Ah, this is kinda like when

26:42.019 --> 26:44.049
we were back in high school.

26:44.049 --> 26:47.150
You doing the video morning

26:44.049 --> 26:47.150
announcements while I filmed it.

26:47.150 --> 26:49.130
Except, no braces for this guy.

26:50.220 --> 26:52.240
Carol's Electronics should

26:50.220 --> 26:52.240
have everything we need.

26:54.119 --> 26:56.250
There may be no need for

26:54.119 --> 26:56.250
Carol's.

26:56.250 --> 26:58.170
Hey, Kevins, we found the van,

26:58.170 --> 27:01.049
but there is obviously no sign

26:58.170 --> 27:01.049
of Sam.

27:01.049 --> 27:02.240
Holly, come here!

27:04.049 --> 27:05.119
Six, six, six.

27:07.119 --> 27:08.230
The number of the beast?

27:09.170 --> 27:11.019
I'll test the red stuff for you

27:09.170 --> 27:11.019
guys

27:11.019 --> 27:12.079
but I'm telling you, this is

27:11.019 --> 27:12.079
probably just

27:12.079 --> 27:15.170
a couple of teenage vaping

27:12.079 --> 27:15.170
hooligans

27:15.170 --> 27:16.220
out trying to have a good time.

27:16.220 --> 27:19.109
Okay, well my camera man is

27:16.220 --> 27:19.109
not at Ornaments Hospital,

27:19.109 --> 27:22.140
so theorize that one for me,

27:19.109 --> 27:22.140
Sheriff.

27:22.140 --> 27:24.089
Telling me how to do my job?

27:24.089 --> 27:25.130
Chris, I'll meet you back here

27:24.089 --> 27:25.130
in five.

27:25.130 --> 27:28.019
I'm gonna go smash a Texas

27:25.130 --> 27:28.019
Mickey of creme de cacao.

27:28.289 --> 27:29.279
Hm, okay.

27:31.190 --> 27:33.099
Thanks, Candace.

27:33.099 --> 27:35.279
Hey, are you two coming

27:33.099 --> 27:35.279
to the hot cocoa ho-down?

27:35.279 --> 27:37.150
I'll be filming for a

27:35.279 --> 27:37.150
big city news station.

27:37.150 --> 27:39.230
Gosh, that sounds just swell.

27:39.230 --> 27:41.039
We'll be there as soon as we

27:39.230 --> 27:41.039
close up.

27:41.039 --> 27:43.029
Au revoir.

27:41.039 --> 27:43.029
Merry Christmas.

27:43.029 --> 27:44.089
Merry Christmas.

27:43.029 --> 27:44.089
Yeah.

27:45.279 --> 27:47.190
All right, everybody.

27:47.190 --> 27:51.210
We are closed, so if

27:47.190 --> 27:51.210
you could go ho ho home.

27:51.210 --> 27:52.130
Merry Christmas!

27:52.130 --> 27:53.210
Merry Christmas.

27:53.210 --> 27:55.000
Merry Christmas.

27:55.000 --> 27:55.250
Happy holidays.

27:55.250 --> 27:59.089
Jingle all the way!

27:55.250 --> 27:59.089
Merry Christmas!

28:00.150 --> 28:03.150
Do you really want to go to that

28:00.150 --> 28:03.150
ho-down?

28:03.150 --> 28:05.039
Of course, it's a classic.

28:05.039 --> 28:07.099
It's my favorite event

28:05.039 --> 28:07.099
of the whole season.

28:07.099 --> 28:08.059
And you heard Mr Pringle,

28:08.059 --> 28:09.259
they're gonna broadcast it on

28:08.059 --> 28:09.259
live TV.

28:09.259 --> 28:11.200
We can wave at our mom's.

28:11.200 --> 28:13.220
But Mayor Danica won the

28:11.200 --> 28:13.220
song contest this year,

28:13.220 --> 28:16.059
which means she'll be singing

28:13.220 --> 28:16.059
"Saucy Santa" there tonight.

28:16.059 --> 28:18.210
That song makes my ears bleed,

28:16.059 --> 28:18.210
Cameron.

28:18.210 --> 28:21.180
(Candace humming)

28:24.220 --> 28:26.079
Really, I,

28:26.079 --> 28:27.250
I think it's super catchy.

28:27.250 --> 28:29.250
Well let's just stay here.

28:29.250 --> 28:32.250
Or, do you wanna graduate

28:29.250 --> 28:32.250
high school still

28:32.250 --> 28:33.259
holding your V card?

28:35.130 --> 28:36.259
I thought I did.

28:36.259 --> 28:37.170
Think about it.

28:37.170 --> 28:39.119
Everyone will be at town hall,

28:39.119 --> 28:43.250
which means that we can scream,

28:39.119 --> 28:43.250
moan as loud as we want.

28:43.250 --> 28:45.099
Now do you?

28:45.099 --> 28:46.220
I don't know, Candace.

28:46.220 --> 28:48.029
Aunt Becky's got surveillance

28:48.029 --> 28:50.019
in case those vaping

28:48.029 --> 28:50.019
teens get the munchies.

28:50.019 --> 28:52.099
We never know when she

28:50.019 --> 28:52.099
might be watching us.

28:53.289 --> 28:54.269
Not today.

28:56.259 --> 28:57.230
Now.

29:03.069 --> 29:07.119
Now, take off that damn

29:03.069 --> 29:07.119
apron you sexy elf.

29:07.119 --> 29:10.029
(Cameron gasps)

29:12.170 --> 29:13.279
When did you start swearing?

29:13.279 --> 29:15.289
That big city TV lady inspired

29:13.279 --> 29:15.289
me.

29:19.279 --> 29:22.069
(cheerful music)

29:22.069 --> 29:24.039
Do you hear that?

29:24.039 --> 29:26.029
My heart beating like

29:24.039 --> 29:26.029
a little drummer boy?

29:26.029 --> 29:26.289
No.

29:28.069 --> 29:29.039

character.

31:14.099 --> 31:16.109
Okay, well horses don't talk.

31:16.109 --> 31:18.029
I had the best idea, daddy.

31:18.029 --> 31:19.119
We should go on a double date.

31:19.119 --> 31:21.150
You and Holly, and me and

31:19.119 --> 31:21.150
Jeremy.

31:21.150 --> 31:24.059
A double date with a couple

31:21.150 --> 31:24.059
of cosplaying underage nerds.

31:24.059 --> 31:25.230
That's gonna be a hard pass.

31:25.230 --> 31:27.000
Trot off, Hope.

31:27.269 --> 31:28.240
It's Faith.

31:31.259 --> 31:33.180
Well maybe we can go out.

31:33.180 --> 31:35.029
Just the two of us.

31:35.029 --> 31:36.099
Chris, look I,

31:37.160 --> 31:42.000
I'm only in town for 72 hours

31:37.160 --> 31:42.000
and you're too good for me.

31:42.000 --> 31:42.269
What, who says?

31:42.269 --> 31:43.230
Says me.

31:43.230 --> 31:46.130
You're so sweet and I,

31:46.130 --> 31:48.240
oh God, I am so sour.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.109
That's my favorite kind of

31:48.240 --> 31:50.109
Chinese food.

31:50.109 --> 31:51.069
Ha ha ha.

31:52.269 --> 31:53.230
Alcohol?

31:54.180 --> 31:55.259
Aren't you on the clock?

31:55.259 --> 31:57.089
I didn't realize you were also a

31:55.259 --> 31:57.089
judge.

31:57.089 --> 31:59.069
Look, vodka is the only thing

31:59.069 --> 32:01.259
that is getting me through this

31:59.069 --> 32:01.259
week.

32:02.220 --> 32:04.160
Look, I'm worried about you.

32:04.160 --> 32:06.079
Well don't be.

32:06.079 --> 32:08.009
I'm gonna be Connie Chung soon

32:06.079 --> 32:08.009
enough.

32:08.009 --> 32:09.089
WOMAN: Come on, let's dance!

32:09.089 --> 32:10.089
(Holly coughs)

32:10.089 --> 32:12.049
(ominous music)

32:12.049 --> 32:13.279
Ha ha, Holly.

32:13.279 --> 32:15.180
Very funny.

32:15.180 --> 32:19.019
(Holly coughing)

32:19.019 --> 32:21.019
Holly!

32:21.019 --> 32:23.130
What's going on?

32:23.130 --> 32:25.049
(Holly coughs)

32:25.049 --> 32:26.230
(bell dinging)

32:26.230 --> 32:29.170
(romantic music)

32:29.170 --> 32:30.130
Whoa, are you okay?

32:30.130 --> 32:32.190
Yeah, I just, um.

32:32.190 --> 32:33.160
I'm fine.

32:35.279 --> 32:37.130
Are you okay?

32:37.130 --> 32:38.150
Uh, yeah.

32:38.150 --> 32:39.140
I'm, I'm fine.

32:39.140 --> 32:41.079
Did you eat one of those

32:39.140 --> 32:41.079
Christmas ham balls?

32:41.079 --> 32:42.220
They are delicious but deadly.

32:42.220 --> 32:45.029
No, just a sip of spiked cocoa,

32:45.029 --> 32:47.269
but something got lodged in my

32:45.029 --> 32:47.269
throat.

32:47.269 --> 32:49.220
Oh, weird.

32:49.220 --> 32:50.279
It was this.

32:50.279 --> 32:51.269
(ominous music)

32:51.269 --> 32:54.150
Holly, isn't that camera man

32:51.269 --> 32:54.150
Sam's?

32:54.150 --> 32:55.119
Um,

32:57.210 --> 32:58.180
I need a minute.

33:03.180 --> 33:06.119
(Holly vomiting)

33:07.250 --> 33:11.099
(toilet flushing)

33:11.099 --> 33:13.240
(dark music)

33:22.279 --> 33:24.150
Well happy freakin' holidays.

33:33.089 --> 33:35.029
was in the hot cocoa dispenser?

33:35.259 --> 33:36.210
Yeah.

33:36.210 --> 33:37.250
That's very bizarre.

33:38.240 --> 33:41.029
But, at least my handsome,

33:38.240 --> 33:41.029
charming,

33:41.029 --> 33:43.180
single brother was there to

33:41.029 --> 33:43.180
rescue you.

33:43.180 --> 33:46.039
Chad, I do not have time for

33:43.180 --> 33:46.039
a romance chat right now.

33:46.039 --> 33:47.279
I'm trying to tell you

33:46.039 --> 33:47.279
something important.

33:47.279 --> 33:49.259
Right, sorry, go ahead.

33:49.259 --> 33:52.089
Ever since I came back

33:49.259 --> 33:52.089
to Ornaments, weird shit.

33:52.089 --> 33:53.039
Stuff.

33:53.039 --> 33:53.230
- Shit.

33:53.039 --> 33:53.230
- Okay.

33:53.230 --> 33:54.289
Has been happening to me.

33:54.289 --> 33:58.009
First, my camera man disappears.

33:58.009 --> 34:00.150
Then I find his van

33:58.009 --> 34:00.150
with bloody sixes on it,

34:00.150 --> 34:03.049
and last night I end up choking

34:00.150 --> 34:03.049
on this?

34:03.049 --> 34:05.009
I'm not sure what you're getting

34:03.049 --> 34:05.009
at.

34:06.019 --> 34:07.000
(ominous music)

34:07.000 --> 34:10.030
I wrote Satan by mistake when I

34:07.000 --> 34:10.030
was seven.

34:10.030 --> 34:12.099
Wait, isn't that how old

34:10.030 --> 34:12.099
you were when your parents?

34:12.099 --> 34:13.170
Were hacked to death?

34:13.170 --> 34:14.289
Oh yeah.

34:14.289 --> 34:17.219
Apparently I asked

34:14.289 --> 34:17.219
Satan to get rid of them

34:17.219 --> 34:19.210
and then they wind up being

34:17.219 --> 34:19.210
murdered.

34:20.260 --> 34:23.099
And last night at the

34:20.260 --> 34:23.099
letters to Santa event,

34:23.099 --> 34:24.190
I wrote to him again.

34:24.190 --> 34:25.139
Why?

34:25.139 --> 34:26.119
What did you write?

34:26.119 --> 34:28.269
I called old heavy hooves a

34:26.119 --> 34:28.269
giant dick.

34:28.269 --> 34:29.179
Oh, Holly.

34:29.179 --> 34:31.260
And then, they got back to me

34:31.260 --> 34:35.000
via the Whit and Wagner

34:31.260 --> 34:35.000
Wine Bar ladies room.

34:36.219 --> 34:37.239
Uh, okay Hol,

34:38.199 --> 34:40.159
the person who hurt your

34:38.199 --> 34:40.159
parents.

34:40.159 --> 34:41.199
That was some nutty nut job

34:41.199 --> 34:45.010
dressed up as Santa the police

34:41.199 --> 34:45.010
could never find, right?

34:45.010 --> 34:47.030
The whole devil thing,

34:47.030 --> 34:49.010
you're not even religious.

34:49.010 --> 34:51.159
You don't believe in Satan,

34:49.010 --> 34:51.159
right?

34:51.159 --> 34:52.119
Right.

34:52.119 --> 34:53.070
You don't even believe in

34:52.119 --> 34:53.070
Christmas.

34:53.070 --> 34:54.139
Right, but.

34:54.139 --> 34:57.050
So this is some vaping teens

34:54.139 --> 34:57.050
playing an April Fools prank.

34:57.050 --> 34:58.230
It's December.

34:58.230 --> 35:00.199
But they're vapists.

35:00.199 --> 35:01.280
They don't know that.

35:01.280 --> 35:04.230
(romantic music)

35:06.210 --> 35:08.230
Oh, jingle my bells.

35:08.230 --> 35:09.230
What?

35:09.230 --> 35:12.079
Holly, this, this is John Smith.

35:12.079 --> 35:13.030
He's uh.

35:12.079 --> 35:13.030
Hey.

35:13.030 --> 35:14.130
An amazing farmer.

35:14.130 --> 35:15.139
Wow, that's hard.

35:15.139 --> 35:18.090
He's got the best, produce

35:15.139 --> 35:18.090
in all of Ornaments.

35:18.090 --> 35:20.070
Oh, you're too kind, Chady.

35:21.039 --> 35:22.079
Chady?

35:22.079 --> 35:24.070
Do people call you Chady?

35:24.070 --> 35:25.019
No.

35:25.019 --> 35:26.030
Oh, um sorry.

35:26.030 --> 35:27.030
No, you can call me that.

35:27.030 --> 35:28.139
I mean if you'd prefer

35:27.030 --> 35:28.139
Chad, I can you Chad.

35:28.139 --> 35:30.010
No, I don't prefer anything.

35:31.039 --> 35:32.199
That, that came out wrong.

35:32.199 --> 35:34.190
Um, well I better get going.

35:34.190 --> 35:35.170
I've got to iron out my suit

35:35.170 --> 35:38.139
before the gingerbread gala

35:35.170 --> 35:38.139
tonight, so.

35:38.139 --> 35:41.030
Nice to meet you and,

35:38.139 --> 35:41.030
see you later.

35:41.030 --> 35:42.130
Yeah, okay.

35:42.130 --> 35:43.019
Oh, yeah, no.

35:43.019 --> 35:44.030
You got it?

35:43.019 --> 35:44.030
I got it.

35:44.030 --> 35:45.050
Okay.

35:44.030 --> 35:45.050
Bye.

35:45.050 --> 35:46.019
Bye.

35:47.239 --> 35:50.280
(Holly laughs mockingly)

35:50.280 --> 35:52.179
Well, it is pretty clear

35:52.179 --> 35:56.030
that he wants to take a nice

35:52.179 --> 35:56.030
juicy bite outta your apple.

35:56.030 --> 35:57.289
Why don't you flirt back?

35:57.289 --> 35:58.289
I tried.

35:58.289 --> 36:01.030
But, look at me.

36:01.030 --> 36:02.269
I'm probably not the guy's type.

36:02.269 --> 36:04.239
I gotta go fill a bunch of pie

36:02.269 --> 36:04.239
orders.

36:05.250 --> 36:07.050
And then the pies themselves.

36:07.050 --> 36:08.050
I'll probably eat one too.

36:08.050 --> 36:09.170
I'm so fat and alone.

36:09.170 --> 36:10.150
It is really good.

36:10.150 --> 36:11.110
CHAD: I know, right?

36:11.110 --> 36:12.079
Hey, Holly.

36:13.030 --> 36:14.230
What, did you go on a shopping

36:13.030 --> 36:14.230
spree?

36:14.230 --> 36:15.230
They're for Danica.

36:15.230 --> 36:16.219
We still haven't found just

36:16.219 --> 36:18.179
the right dress for

36:16.219 --> 36:18.179
the gingerbread gala.

36:18.179 --> 36:19.130
Mm.

36:19.130 --> 36:20.230
I heard you met my brother,

36:19.130 --> 36:20.230
Cole.

36:20.230 --> 36:22.030
The singing Sheriff.

36:22.030 --> 36:24.000
He thought you were pretty cute.

36:24.000 --> 36:28.050
I mean, for an adult woman

36:24.000 --> 36:28.050
who steals Darby Dream Wagons.

36:28.050 --> 36:29.179
I'd be happy to set you two up

36:28.050 --> 36:29.179
on a date.

36:29.179 --> 36:31.150
I'm not interested in

36:29.179 --> 36:31.150
getting to know Cole,

36:31.150 --> 36:35.289
or any other band better in

36:31.150 --> 36:35.289
this creepy ass Christmas town.

36:35.289 --> 36:39.000
Second my gig ends, I am

36:35.289 --> 36:39.000
peacing out, never to return.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.079
I don't believe you, Holly

36:39.000 --> 36:40.079
Winters.

36:40.079 --> 36:41.090
That's not my name anymore.

36:41.090 --> 36:42.289
I see it, deep down.

36:42.289 --> 36:44.019
What are you talking about?

36:44.019 --> 36:45.139
The Christmas candle.

36:45.139 --> 36:46.210
Inside your heart.

36:47.199 --> 36:48.199
It's still lit.

36:49.230 --> 36:53.019
Okay, that makes like zero sense

36:53.019 --> 36:55.250
and you don't even know me, Joy.

tenor.

37:34.099 --> 37:36.099
Yeah, most people don't

37:34.099 --> 37:36.099
expect that from me.

37:36.099 --> 37:37.070
I bet they don't.

37:37.070 --> 37:38.170
Unfortunately,

37:39.210 --> 37:42.030
we already have someone in

37:39.210 --> 37:42.030
your vocal range right now.

37:42.030 --> 37:44.239
So I don't think it's gonna

37:42.030 --> 37:44.239
be a really good fit for us.

37:44.239 --> 37:45.199
Oh.

37:46.170 --> 37:47.119
That, that's too bad.

37:47.119 --> 37:49.099
It really is.

37:49.099 --> 37:51.190
Yeah, it really, really is.

37:53.170 --> 37:55.119
Oh, but would you like to take

37:55.119 --> 37:57.179
one of my heavenly cookies over

37:55.119 --> 37:57.179
there?

37:57.179 --> 37:58.159
My little angels.

37:58.159 --> 37:59.139
Hi guys!

37:59.139 --> 38:00.269
For the road?

38:00.269 --> 38:02.090
Uh, I'm good.

38:02.090 --> 38:03.039
Are you sure?

38:03.039 --> 38:03.289
They're delish.

38:03.289 --> 38:05.230
Maybe uh, save it for the poor

38:03.289 --> 38:05.230
kids

38:05.230 --> 38:07.170
at the toy drive tomorrow night.

38:08.219 --> 38:10.289
Well now that is a

38:08.219 --> 38:10.289
thoughtful though, Cole.

38:10.289 --> 38:12.269
Yes, and um, okay.

38:12.269 --> 38:13.170
Well, you know what?

38:13.170 --> 38:15.090
Better try next year, right?

38:15.090 --> 38:17.130
Good try today.

♪ Aah ♪

38:18.130 --> 38:20.170

38:20.170 --> 38:21.179
Bye bye.

38:24.210 --> 38:26.130
(ominous music)

38:26.130 --> 38:27.260
Oh angel Jennifer, I shan't.

38:30.039 --> 38:32.219
Well what's, one little bite of

38:30.039 --> 38:32.219
your,

38:32.219 --> 38:34.099
your wing gonna do, right?

38:35.079 --> 38:36.159
Oh, I mean.

38:37.130 --> 38:40.269
How many calories can that be?

38:43.070 --> 38:46.110
(Aunt Becky moaning)

38:53.039 --> 38:56.050
(ominous music)

38:56.050 --> 38:58.000
I missed you so much.

39:00.030 --> 39:03.059
Mommy, why did you hurt me?

39:03.059 --> 39:06.039
(Aunt Becky screams)

39:06.039 --> 39:07.199
What, what what?

39:08.179 --> 39:09.239
Oh my gosh.

39:09.239 --> 39:10.219
My angels,

39:10.219 --> 39:12.199
I didn't realize you guys were

39:10.219 --> 39:12.199
all alive.

39:12.199 --> 39:14.139
You killed Jennifer!

39:14.139 --> 39:15.090
Bad mommy!

39:15.090 --> 39:17.110
I, I didn't know what I was

39:15.090 --> 39:17.110
doing.

39:17.110 --> 39:18.250
I can make you a new friend.

39:18.250 --> 39:20.110
(cookies crying)

39:20.110 --> 39:21.059
Please don't cry.

39:21.059 --> 39:22.039
(ominous music)

39:22.039 --> 39:23.130
Jingle bells!

39:24.250 --> 39:25.150
No.

39:25.150 --> 39:26.280
Do you know what time it is?

39:26.280 --> 39:28.130
(Aunt Becky screaming)

39:28.130 --> 39:29.280
Cookie time!

39:29.280 --> 39:32.219
(Satan Claus laughs evilly)

39:32.219 --> 39:33.170
(Aunt Becky screaming)

39:33.170 --> 39:36.139
Burn bright, my little star

39:33.170 --> 39:36.139
baker.

39:36.139 --> 39:39.179
(Satan Claus laughs)

39:48.170 --> 39:52.110
that there's literally no waywh

39:52.110 --> 39:55.039
to get a coffee in a

39:52.110 --> 39:55.039
coffee shop this morning.

39:55.039 --> 39:56.170
Yes.

39:56.170 --> 39:57.119
Great, fantastic.

39:57.119 --> 39:59.090
Well, I hope you have a great

39:57.119 --> 39:59.090
day

39:59.090 --> 40:02.170
because you're making me have

39:59.090 --> 40:02.170
vodka for breakfast, again.

40:04.019 --> 40:04.280
Watch it.

40:07.219 --> 40:09.239
Don't help us or anything.

40:09.239 --> 40:11.179
Oh I uh, I wasn't going to.

40:12.269 --> 40:14.230
Um, give us a second, Joy.

40:14.230 --> 40:15.230
Of course.

40:15.230 --> 40:17.050
You know what, Holly?

40:17.050 --> 40:18.269
With Chris Pringle you are

40:17.050 --> 40:18.269
barking up

40:18.269 --> 40:19.289
the wrong Christmas tree.

40:19.289 --> 40:23.230
Oh my God, I am not

40:19.289 --> 40:23.230
interested in Chris Pringle.

40:23.230 --> 40:26.190
Okay, like maybe to like

40:23.230 --> 40:26.190
bang once before I bounce.

40:27.150 --> 40:30.190
Why is everybody so obsessed

40:27.150 --> 40:30.190
with love in this town?

40:30.190 --> 40:34.099
Well at least we can love

40:30.190 --> 40:34.099
something other than the bottle.

40:34.099 --> 40:37.239
Go back to the big city

40:34.099 --> 40:37.239
and drink your life away.

40:37.239 --> 40:42.119
Okay, and why don't you go

40:37.239 --> 40:42.119
straight to hell, Mayor.

40:44.280 --> 40:45.230
Ugh!

40:46.179 --> 40:48.000
The nerve.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.030
Uh, the gala committee needs you

40:50.030 --> 40:51.250
to approve tonight's gala

40:50.030 --> 40:51.250
decorations.

40:51.250 --> 40:54.019
They also have some

40:51.250 --> 40:54.019
questions about the auction.

40:54.019 --> 40:55.050
Why do I have to do everything?

40:55.050 --> 40:57.070
Because you're the mayor.

40:58.260 --> 41:01.010
I guess I'll have to try on

40:58.260 --> 41:01.010
my dresses at the hall, then.

41:01.010 --> 41:02.070
You're gonna look great in

41:01.010 --> 41:02.070
everything.

41:02.070 --> 41:05.099
Oh, thank you I, I mean I've

41:02.070 --> 41:05.099
been working out a lot, so.

41:05.099 --> 41:06.159
It shows.

41:06.159 --> 41:09.130
(whimsical music)

41:15.150 --> 41:16.179
How's it going in there?

41:18.090 --> 41:23.090
Joy, do you call this polyester

41:18.090 --> 41:23.090
candy cane mess, classy?

41:23.090 --> 41:25.219
'Cause if I wear it tonight,

41:23.090 --> 41:25.219
kids will lick me to death.

41:25.219 --> 41:28.239
Uh, well, there are still

41:28.239 --> 41:31.210
a few more options that you

41:28.239 --> 41:31.210
haven't tried.

41:31.210 --> 41:34.010
This one's custom.

41:34.010 --> 41:35.159
It's from Paris.

41:35.159 --> 41:37.269
Oh, now we're talking.

41:37.269 --> 41:41.010
Oh, but it's a size zero, so.

41:41.010 --> 41:41.280
Trust me.

41:42.239 --> 41:44.010
I'm a size zero, Joy.

41:45.110 --> 41:46.159
Of course you are.

41:47.230 --> 41:49.090
Double zero even.

41:59.219 --> 42:03.059
(light mysterious music)

42:05.250 --> 42:07.210
Joy, you weren't kidding.

42:07.210 --> 42:09.099
I think we have a winner.

42:11.019 --> 42:12.130
(ominous music)

42:12.130 --> 42:13.159
Do you need a hand?

42:16.070 --> 42:17.099
Oh thank you, Joy.

42:17.099 --> 42:20.019
It must have been a man

42:17.099 --> 42:20.019
that invented side zippers.

42:20.019 --> 42:22.110
See, I told you I was a size

42:20.019 --> 42:22.110
zero.

42:22.110 --> 42:25.010
Your bow looks a little limp,

42:22.110 --> 42:25.010
Mayor.

42:25.010 --> 42:28.059
Perhaps I could assist you with

42:25.010 --> 42:28.059
it, hm?

42:28.059 --> 42:31.170
(Danica whimpering)

42:31.170 --> 42:33.110
Are you okay?

42:33.110 --> 42:34.239
Mayor?

42:34.239 --> 42:36.230
(Danica choking)

42:36.230 --> 42:38.059
Danica?

42:38.059 --> 42:39.019
Mayor?

42:40.070 --> 42:43.079
(Danica choking)

42:43.079 --> 42:44.289
Do you need me to come in there?

42:44.289 --> 42:47.269
SATAN CLAUS: Oh that

42:44.289 --> 42:47.269
dress is just to die for.

42:47.269 --> 42:50.039
(Satan Claus laughing evilly)

42:50.039 --> 42:53.099
(Danica choking)

42:53.099 --> 42:55.269
I have this trick with

42:53.099 --> 42:55.269
butter and a coat hanger.

42:55.269 --> 42:57.119
I can get you right in there.

42:58.139 --> 43:00.170
SATAN CLAUS: Isn't that

42:58.139 --> 43:00.170
line a little tight?

43:00.170 --> 43:03.119
(Satan Claus laughing)

43:03.119 --> 43:04.179
I'm coming in there.

43:05.150 --> 43:08.019
(tense music)

43:13.010 --> 43:16.110
(Satan Claus laughing)

43:18.000 --> 43:19.280
Is there any way to just like

43:19.280 --> 43:22.199
get a normal coffee around here?

43:22.199 --> 43:26.010
But you're so ho ho, hot,

43:22.199 --> 43:26.010
chocolate.

43:26.010 --> 43:28.179
Chad, that's not even

43:26.010 --> 43:28.179
a real play on words.

43:28.179 --> 43:31.139
Not everything said here has to

43:28.179 --> 43:31.139
be like,

43:31.139 --> 43:34.139
Christmas explosion.

43:34.139 --> 43:35.260
Nah, I disatree.

43:35.260 --> 43:37.010
Chad.

43:37.010 --> 43:38.010
I'll murder you in your sleep.

43:38.010 --> 43:38.289
That one needs work.

43:38.289 --> 43:39.239
Chad!

43:39.239 --> 43:40.130
What's going on?

43:40.130 --> 43:41.190
A monster took the Mayor!

43:41.190 --> 43:42.139
What?

43:42.139 --> 43:43.099
Let's go.

43:45.210 --> 43:47.230
She went through there.

43:47.230 --> 43:50.210
With him, the monster man.

43:50.210 --> 43:53.190
I didn't see him but he had

43:50.210 --> 43:53.190
this horrible chuckle like,

43:54.159 --> 43:56.289
nails on a chalkboard

43:54.159 --> 43:56.289
mixed with a lion's roar.

43:58.039 --> 43:59.099
Shit.

43:59.099 --> 44:00.269
We'll get one of your brother's

43:59.099 --> 44:00.269
down here to investigate.

44:00.269 --> 44:02.139
Maybe Cole.

44:02.139 --> 44:05.000
Yes, definitely, definitely

44:02.139 --> 44:05.000
Cole.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.099
Maybe he can see where the

44:05.000 --> 44:07.099
air vent goes, you know?

44:07.099 --> 44:10.199
Meanwhile just, try to relax,

44:07.099 --> 44:10.199
okay?

44:10.199 --> 44:12.260
How the frankincense am I

44:10.199 --> 44:12.260
supposed to relax right now?

44:12.260 --> 44:15.190
Well, you used to be a

44:12.260 --> 44:15.190
competitive snowman builder,

44:15.190 --> 44:16.170
right?

44:16.170 --> 44:18.150
Okay yeah, that's not a thing.

44:18.150 --> 44:20.130
Tell that to my coach.

44:20.130 --> 44:24.010
I medaled at the world snowman

44:20.130 --> 44:24.010
championship in Finland.

44:24.010 --> 44:25.050
Twice.

44:25.050 --> 44:26.170
Twice.

44:26.170 --> 44:31.210
Okay then go and build a

44:26.170 --> 44:31.210
freaking snowman.

44:31.210 --> 44:33.110
You know, frozen.

44:35.110 --> 44:36.059
You see, Chad.

44:36.059 --> 44:38.010
I am not crazy.

44:38.010 --> 44:39.019
I know you're not.

44:39.269 --> 44:42.239
This is not normal for

44:39.269 --> 44:42.239
Ornaments.

44:45.059 --> 44:46.099
For anywhere.

44:58.210 --> 45:00.050
Now for the eyes.

45:01.150 --> 45:03.159
I wonder what I can use.

45:06.280 --> 45:08.280
SATAN CLAUS: I can help you with

45:06.280 --> 45:08.280
those.

45:10.110 --> 45:13.119
I spy some pretty little eyes.

45:14.289 --> 45:15.260
Hello?

45:18.059 --> 45:19.170
Noel?

45:19.170 --> 45:20.079
Cole?

45:20.079 --> 45:22.159
SATAN CLAUS: No no, over here.

45:22.159 --> 45:23.119
That's right.

45:24.059 --> 45:27.059
Why don't you come a little

45:24.059 --> 45:27.059
closer.

45:28.289 --> 45:31.219
Would you like to be

45:28.289 --> 45:31.219
friends with a snowman, Joy?

45:32.269 --> 45:36.030
Would you like to go

45:32.269 --> 45:36.030
on a magical adventure

45:36.030 --> 45:37.269
just like you've always dreamed

45:36.030 --> 45:37.269
of?

45:39.150 --> 45:40.099
(Satan Claus laughing)

45:40.099 --> 45:42.190
(Joy grunting)

45:42.190 --> 45:45.030
(dark music)

45:55.000 --> 45:57.019
(flesh ripping)

46:11.000 --> 46:11.260
Hello?

46:12.239 --> 46:15.239
(melancholy music)

46:20.119 --> 46:25.139
Shit.

46:26.010 --> 46:27.000
(horrific music)

46:27.000 --> 46:28.059
Oh Jesus!

46:28.059 --> 46:30.030
God, you scared the crap out of

46:28.059 --> 46:30.030
me.

46:30.030 --> 46:31.099
Where's Aunt Becky?

46:31.099 --> 46:32.250
Oh I, I don't know.

46:32.250 --> 46:34.260
I was downtown working

46:32.250 --> 46:34.260
on my nativity scene.

46:34.260 --> 46:37.059
It's gonna rock everyone's

46:34.260 --> 46:37.059
Christmas socks off.

46:37.059 --> 46:38.199
Aunt Becky said that she

46:37.059 --> 46:38.199
had choir practice here

46:38.199 --> 46:40.210
and then she was gonna

46:38.199 --> 46:40.210
carpool with us to the gala.

46:40.210 --> 46:42.230
Maybe she changed her mind.

46:42.230 --> 46:43.190
Now you go get ready.

46:43.190 --> 46:45.250
You have a gingerbread gala to

46:43.190 --> 46:45.250
cover.

46:45.250 --> 46:47.019
Right, yeah.

46:47.280 --> 46:51.250
Does it, kinda like, smell funny

46:47.280 --> 46:51.250
to you?

46:52.179 --> 46:53.219
Cookies.

46:53.219 --> 46:56.170
And let's drop by my nativity

46:53.219 --> 46:56.170
scene on the way there.

46:59.219 --> 47:01.119
This is it.

47:04.260 --> 47:05.269
Hey!

47:05.269 --> 47:08.230
Losers, my sister here,

47:08.230 --> 47:11.039
look she spent a lot of

47:08.230 --> 47:11.039
time on this nativity scene,

47:11.039 --> 47:13.210
so why don't you and your little

47:11.039 --> 47:13.210
friend

47:13.210 --> 47:14.199
go and fill your lungs

47:14.199 --> 47:18.039
with electronic teen

47:14.199 --> 47:18.039
cancer somewhere else?

47:18.039 --> 47:19.059
Get out of here.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.059
Scram.

47:22.190 --> 47:24.000
Thank you, Hol.

47:24.000 --> 47:28.239
Hey, I think your nativity

47:24.000 --> 47:28.239
scene looks...

47:31.219 --> 47:32.230
sweet.

47:32.230 --> 47:33.239
Oh!

47:35.079 --> 47:36.030
Thank you.

47:36.030 --> 47:37.110
Come on, let's go.

47:38.219 --> 47:40.230
See that little camel?

47:41.190 --> 47:44.110
(ominous music)

47:48.219 --> 47:51.030
The silent auction for

47:48.219 --> 47:51.030
the gingerbread houses

47:51.030 --> 47:52.250
is already underway.

47:52.250 --> 47:55.280
But these are not your typical

47:52.250 --> 47:55.280
structures.

47:55.280 --> 48:00.230
There are skyscrapers, theme

47:55.280 --> 48:00.230
parks, even a Mall of America.

48:00.230 --> 48:04.059
All made out of molasses and

48:00.230 --> 48:04.059
dough.

48:04.059 --> 48:08.079
Holly, do I spy a gingerbread

48:04.059 --> 48:08.079
Statue of Liberty?

48:08.079 --> 48:10.000
You sure do, Christie.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.059
Oh, America's never looked so

48:10.000 --> 48:13.059
delicious.

48:13.059 --> 48:15.190
(Holly laughs)

48:15.190 --> 48:17.260
Well, I'll be back here tomorrow

48:15.190 --> 48:17.260
night

48:17.260 --> 48:21.010
for the very white elephant gift

48:17.260 --> 48:21.010
exchange.

48:21.010 --> 48:22.239
Christie, Dean.

48:22.239 --> 48:23.199
Thanks Holly.

48:24.269 --> 48:26.199
Up next, Autumn.

48:26.199 --> 48:29.019
The very incredible baby hippo

48:29.019 --> 48:32.190
who can paint with her webbed

48:29.019 --> 48:32.190
feet.

48:32.190 --> 48:33.170
Adorable.

48:33.170 --> 48:35.070
Oh man.

48:35.070 --> 48:37.010
These cheapy candy cane heels.

48:37.010 --> 48:38.289
They're just, they're killing

48:37.010 --> 48:38.289
me.

48:38.289 --> 48:40.050
(rhythmic drumming)

48:40.050 --> 48:43.159
Oh great, the dancing portion

48:40.050 --> 48:43.159
of the evening has begun.

48:43.159 --> 48:45.099
Time to get the fudge home.

48:45.099 --> 48:47.050
Fudge, sounds like Ornaments'

48:47.050 --> 48:48.190
maybe rubbing off on you after

48:47.050 --> 48:48.190
all.

48:48.190 --> 48:50.039
Ha ha, it's not.

48:50.039 --> 48:51.000
I meant to say.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.099
Frost.

48:52.099 --> 48:53.119
Miss Frost.

48:53.119 --> 48:54.070
Oh, no thanks.

48:54.070 --> 48:56.059
Those ham balls taste like rat

48:54.070 --> 48:56.059
meat

48:56.059 --> 48:58.030
stuffed into dirty baby socks.

48:58.030 --> 49:00.210
Actually, I was wondering

48:58.030 --> 49:00.210
if you'd like to dance.

49:01.159 --> 49:02.119
Holly hates dancing.

49:02.119 --> 49:04.019
Prom night, senior year.

49:04.019 --> 49:06.010
She had us teepee the

49:04.019 --> 49:06.010
principal's house instead.

49:06.010 --> 49:09.150
Well, maybe I could um, make an

49:06.010 --> 49:09.150
exception.

49:09.150 --> 49:10.230
Jack Goldman.

49:10.230 --> 49:11.250
Goldman.

49:11.250 --> 49:13.219
You're the one who's house

49:11.250 --> 49:13.219
got Christmas lighted.

49:13.219 --> 49:15.250
By some vaping teen skamps.

49:15.250 --> 49:17.119
Why, is me being Jewish a

49:15.250 --> 49:17.119
problem?

49:17.119 --> 49:18.130
Not at all.

49:18.130 --> 49:19.159
I find it quite exotic.

49:19.159 --> 49:20.219
I mean, for this town.

49:22.070 --> 49:24.119
Are you good to pack up on your

49:22.070 --> 49:24.119
own?

49:24.119 --> 49:25.070
Sure.

49:25.070 --> 49:26.039
Great.

49:30.030 --> 49:31.199
Ooh.

49:31.199 --> 49:36.030
Deputy Wreath, you clean up

49:31.199 --> 49:36.030
like a maid at a frat house.

49:36.030 --> 49:38.159
I was wondering if I

49:36.030 --> 49:38.159
could have this dance.

49:38.159 --> 49:40.130
I I I was just gonna ask the

49:38.159 --> 49:40.130
same thing.

49:40.130 --> 49:41.079
Chris.

49:41.079 --> 49:42.210
Boys, she's taken.

49:42.210 --> 49:44.030
Well, I'm not taken.

49:44.030 --> 49:44.230
It's just supposed to be like a

49:44.030 --> 49:44.230
dance.

49:44.230 --> 49:47.019
Aren't you working, Goldman?

49:47.019 --> 49:48.139
Holly, one song, just you and

49:47.019 --> 49:48.139
me.

49:48.139 --> 49:49.269
Okay, boys, boys boys boys.

49:49.269 --> 49:51.190
There's no need to fight.

49:51.190 --> 49:54.269
Why don't we head back

49:51.190 --> 49:54.269
to my sister's place

49:54.269 --> 49:57.260
and have a little four person

49:54.269 --> 49:57.260
dance party

49:57.260 --> 49:59.099
in my childhood bedroom?

50:00.239 --> 50:02.210
Wait, I don't remember

50:00.239 --> 50:02.210
the floor in your room

50:02.210 --> 50:04.139
being that big, Hol.

50:04.139 --> 50:07.119
(Faith screaming)

50:09.099 --> 50:11.070
Honey what's, what's wrong?

50:11.070 --> 50:14.030
Danica, she, she's dead.

50:14.030 --> 50:15.079
Hey, Danica's just late to the

50:14.030 --> 50:15.079
gala.

50:15.079 --> 50:18.070
No, I saw her outside in a

50:15.079 --> 50:18.070
manger,

50:18.070 --> 50:20.119
dressed like a wise man.

50:20.119 --> 50:22.230
(Faith crying)

50:22.230 --> 50:23.260
Oh my gosh!

50:23.260 --> 50:26.079
Chad, grab my camera, press

50:23.260 --> 50:26.079
the damn record button.

50:26.079 --> 50:28.070
Kevins, get me back on,

50:26.079 --> 50:28.070
I've got breaking news.

50:28.070 --> 50:30.269
Move people, out of the way!

50:30.269 --> 50:34.000
Now the quality of ivory in a

50:30.269 --> 50:34.000
hippos tusk

50:34.000 --> 50:37.010
is not as good as an elephant's

50:34.000 --> 50:37.010
tusk.

50:37.010 --> 50:37.219
It's not good.

50:37.219 --> 50:39.000
But it does not hold them back

50:39.000 --> 50:41.230
from being exceptional artists.

50:41.230 --> 50:44.000
I mean, Jackson Pollock at this

50:41.230 --> 50:44.000
age.

50:44.000 --> 50:44.250
Now, can you see me?

50:44.250 --> 50:45.139
Hear me?

50:44.250 --> 50:45.139
Yes, Holly?

50:45.139 --> 50:47.030
Okay, we're almost there.

50:47.030 --> 50:48.170
Excuse me.

50:49.230 --> 50:52.239
A young girl has just found

50:49.230 --> 50:52.239
Mayor Danica Bells dead outside,

50:52.239 --> 50:55.039
posed in a gruesome nativity

50:52.239 --> 50:55.039
scene.

50:55.039 --> 50:56.099
I think I have a guess

50:56.099 --> 50:58.099
as to what may have killed Mayor

50:56.099 --> 50:58.099
Bells.

51:04.210 --> 51:06.079
False alarm, um.

51:07.190 --> 51:09.230
- Back to you.

51:07.190 --> 51:09.230
- Yes.

51:09.230 --> 51:12.050
What's with the interrupting,

51:09.230 --> 51:12.050
about the death stuff again?

51:12.050 --> 51:14.170
- It's always about murders.

51:12.050 --> 51:14.170
- 'Cause now my heart rate

51:14.170 --> 51:16.150
is certainly up.

51:16.150 --> 51:17.150
You know what?

51:17.150 --> 51:19.159
This is why we love to

51:17.150 --> 51:19.159
share human interests

51:19.159 --> 51:21.230
and also hippo interest stories.

51:22.190 --> 51:24.070
Huh, no no no.

51:24.070 --> 51:24.280
Oh no.

51:24.280 --> 51:26.039
Daddy, daddy, I swear I saw her.

51:26.039 --> 51:27.159
You have to believe me.

51:27.159 --> 51:28.119
I think you've just had

51:28.119 --> 51:29.289
a little too much sugar tonight,

51:28.119 --> 51:29.289
honey.

51:29.289 --> 51:31.039
I believe you, Faith.

51:32.070 --> 51:33.090
You do?

51:34.050 --> 51:35.250
Holly thinks that all the blood

51:35.250 --> 51:38.130
and missing people could be the

51:35.250 --> 51:38.130
work of,

51:39.250 --> 51:40.199
Satan.

51:40.199 --> 51:41.219
It's true.

51:41.219 --> 51:42.170
Do you have any proof?

51:42.170 --> 51:43.170
Yeah, I have proof.

51:43.170 --> 51:45.130
I have a picture of a

51:43.170 --> 51:45.130
note written in blood,

51:45.130 --> 51:47.119
and you saw the vent, plus

51:45.130 --> 51:47.119
the van the other night.

51:47.119 --> 51:49.000
No, those are the same vaping

51:47.119 --> 51:49.000
teens

51:49.000 --> 51:50.150
who vandalized Goldman's place.

51:50.150 --> 51:52.099
They probably used cranberry

51:50.150 --> 51:52.099
sauce or something.

51:52.099 --> 51:54.000
It's not cranberry sauce.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.159
If you would test it you would

51:54.000 --> 51:55.159
see that.

51:55.159 --> 51:58.079
Okay, I'm gonna find Danica

51:55.159 --> 51:58.079
and put this all to bed.

52:00.050 --> 52:01.260
Faith, why don't you go lend a

52:00.050 --> 52:01.260
hand.

52:01.260 --> 52:02.199
Yeah, okay.

52:05.230 --> 52:08.030
Holly, you're freaking everyone

52:05.230 --> 52:08.030
out.

52:08.030 --> 52:10.210
Yeah, well we should

52:08.030 --> 52:10.210
be freaked out, Chris.

52:10.210 --> 52:12.000
Look, over the past few days,

52:12.000 --> 52:14.179
your Mayor cousin,

52:12.000 --> 52:14.179
snowman building Joy,

52:14.179 --> 52:18.210
those two nerdy baristas, and

52:14.179 --> 52:18.210
Aunt Becky have all vanished.

52:18.210 --> 52:19.179
It's Satan.

52:20.159 --> 52:22.219
Holly, I care about you.

52:23.260 --> 52:26.130
But the devil doesn't make

52:23.260 --> 52:26.130
baristas disappear for sport.

52:26.130 --> 52:31.050
And throwing around the S

52:26.130 --> 52:31.050
word, isn't good for Faith.

52:32.019 --> 52:33.000
She's sensitive.

52:34.050 --> 52:36.250
Because of her mother and

52:34.050 --> 52:36.250
the hot air balloon accident,

52:36.250 --> 52:38.289
I can't have anything happen to

52:36.250 --> 52:38.289
her.

52:38.289 --> 52:42.010
Especially something so,

52:38.289 --> 52:42.010
darn silly.

52:42.010 --> 52:43.210
No, Chris, I'm telling you.

52:43.210 --> 52:46.099
Look, I think it's best

52:43.210 --> 52:46.099
you find a new camera man.

52:47.079 --> 52:48.110
And a new man friend.

52:50.010 --> 52:50.260
Uh.

52:50.260 --> 52:51.219
I gotta go.

52:56.030 --> 52:57.019
We're not dating.

52:58.139 --> 52:59.230
Satan.

52:59.230 --> 53:00.250
I warned you, Holly.

53:00.250 --> 53:02.070
No depressing stuff.

53:02.070 --> 53:05.130
And, you cut off our painting

53:02.070 --> 53:05.130
hippo story.

53:05.130 --> 53:07.000
If you want that anchor cheese,

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
you stick to the script and

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
look relatable while doing it.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.079
So smile like crazy when

53:10.000 --> 53:12.079
you're with the kiddos tonight.

53:12.079 --> 53:13.130
Something is not right here

53:13.130 --> 53:14.250
and I want to solve why.

53:14.250 --> 53:17.090
Yeah, no solving, just smiling.

53:21.219 --> 53:22.179
Who was that?

53:22.179 --> 53:24.139
Just my bitch boss.

53:25.099 --> 53:26.289
He, like the rest of Ornaments,

53:26.289 --> 53:28.130
doesn't give a flying fudge

53:28.130 --> 53:30.230
that freaky stuff is

53:28.130 --> 53:30.230
happening in this world.

53:31.239 --> 53:32.280
I don't know.

53:32.280 --> 53:34.050
Maybe he's right, maybe,

53:34.289 --> 53:36.250
maybe I shouldn't either.

53:36.250 --> 53:39.150
Do you ever wear your hair down?

53:39.150 --> 53:40.280
I overheard your call.

53:40.280 --> 53:41.239
Oh no.

53:42.210 --> 53:46.070
If you want to be more

53:42.210 --> 53:46.070
relatable, may I?

53:47.010 --> 53:48.159
(sleigh bells ringing)

53:48.159 --> 53:49.159
Sure.

53:49.159 --> 53:50.059
Okay.

53:50.059 --> 53:52.079
(cheerful music)

54:04.050 --> 54:05.260
(Cookie laughs)

54:05.260 --> 54:07.159
And now for the grand finale.

54:10.239 --> 54:11.150
Um.

54:11.150 --> 54:13.050
Have a holly jolly Christmas.

54:13.050 --> 54:14.150
You get it?

54:14.150 --> 54:15.230
Um, not a clue.

54:17.010 --> 54:17.260
Because your name is Holly.

54:17.260 --> 54:19.139
I'm kidding, Cook.

54:19.139 --> 54:21.239
It's amazing.

54:21.239 --> 54:24.050
Now get outta here so I can

54:21.239 --> 54:24.050
change into this masterpiece.

54:24.050 --> 54:25.059
Oh, hold on.

54:27.269 --> 54:29.219
Okay, it's not very Christmassy.

54:29.219 --> 54:31.030
No, it's for when you put on the

54:29.219 --> 54:31.030
sweater

54:31.030 --> 54:33.099
to protect your makeup and your

54:31.030 --> 54:33.099
curls.

54:33.099 --> 54:35.050
That's very weird.

54:35.050 --> 54:36.019
Okay.

54:36.019 --> 54:37.119
Hey, hey hey hey.

54:38.230 --> 54:40.130
Thank you.

54:40.130 --> 54:42.050
What's family for?

54:43.070 --> 54:44.119
Yay!

54:44.119 --> 54:45.139
Yay, yay, yay.

54:48.119 --> 54:49.139
Okay.

54:55.260 --> 54:56.219
(mysterious music)

54:56.219 --> 54:58.079
Perfectly relatable.

54:58.079 --> 55:01.000
(ominous music)

55:05.059 --> 55:06.139
Okay, ready people.

55:06.139 --> 55:08.210
Three, two, show time.

55:10.079 --> 55:13.239
Everybody ready for some

55:10.079 --> 55:13.239
holiday cheer and magic?

55:13.239 --> 55:15.250
Okay Faith, open up your

55:13.239 --> 55:15.250
present.

55:18.239 --> 55:21.280
And, what did you get, little

55:18.239 --> 55:21.280
girl?

55:21.280 --> 55:26.010
Ooh, I think it might be

55:21.280 --> 55:26.010
raspberry jelly.

55:26.010 --> 55:27.059
Ooh.

55:27.059 --> 55:28.139
I think it leaked through.

55:28.139 --> 55:29.139
Wow.

55:29.139 --> 55:32.000
Okay, you can open up

55:29.139 --> 55:32.000
your presents now, too.

55:33.079 --> 55:34.030
Ah!

55:34.030 --> 55:35.010
Oh wait, it's uh.

55:35.010 --> 55:36.179
(ominous music)

55:36.179 --> 55:37.199
It's a foot.

55:39.190 --> 55:40.269
From a person.

55:40.269 --> 55:42.099
(people gasping)

55:42.099 --> 55:44.239
MAN: Is that, is that real?

55:44.239 --> 55:47.159
(ominous music)

56:11.269 --> 56:13.030
Holly.

56:13.030 --> 56:14.099
Are you having a stroke?

56:14.099 --> 56:16.050
Uh, yeah um.

56:16.050 --> 56:20.260
I think that maybe we

56:16.050 --> 56:20.260
should, uh, wrap this up.

56:20.260 --> 56:23.110
I'm uh.

56:20.260 --> 56:23.110
Thank you.

56:23.110 --> 56:24.059
I think, I mean.

56:24.059 --> 56:26.010
Put the fudging camera down,

56:24.059 --> 56:26.010
Chad!

56:26.010 --> 56:27.199
Oh my God, Cookie!

56:27.199 --> 56:29.130
(people gasping)

56:29.130 --> 56:30.110
She's not breathing!

56:30.110 --> 56:31.110
Someone call an ambulance!

56:31.110 --> 56:33.090
I can do CPR while we wait.

56:33.090 --> 56:35.110
Can I get the parents

56:33.090 --> 56:35.110
to grab their children

56:35.110 --> 56:37.090
and take them home immediately.

56:37.090 --> 56:38.289
That's an order.

56:38.289 --> 56:40.050
All of this it,

56:40.050 --> 56:43.099
it must have triggered her

56:40.050 --> 56:43.099
back to that Christmas morning.

56:43.099 --> 56:44.239
She's gonna be okay, right?

56:46.110 --> 56:47.190
She has to be okay.

56:49.199 --> 56:54.199
(sirens blaring)

56:49.199 --> 56:54.199
(dramatic music)

57:03.039 --> 57:06.099
This is the same thing happened

57:03.039 --> 57:06.099
to your parents, isn't it?

57:06.099 --> 57:07.119
Yeah, Aunt Becky said they were

57:06.099 --> 57:07.119
found

57:07.119 --> 57:09.260
wrapped up like gifts

57:07.119 --> 57:09.260
under the Christmas tree.

57:11.070 --> 57:13.099
If the killer really is back,

57:13.099 --> 57:15.159
that means he went dormant for

57:13.099 --> 57:15.159
decades

57:15.159 --> 57:17.170
and came back right when you

57:15.159 --> 57:17.170
did.

57:17.170 --> 57:19.000
What are you saying, Noel?

57:19.280 --> 57:22.099
I'm saying it's a hell of a

57:19.280 --> 57:22.099
coincidence.

57:22.099 --> 57:23.000
I don't have time for this right

57:22.099 --> 57:23.000
now.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.010
I need to be with my sister.

57:24.010 --> 57:25.090
Chad, Chris, wait up.

57:38.059 --> 57:39.070
Hey.

57:41.179 --> 57:42.179
It's warm.

57:42.179 --> 57:43.199
Thank you.

57:45.150 --> 57:46.159
How you feeling?

57:48.119 --> 57:53.110
My brain's just trying to

57:48.119 --> 57:53.110
make sense of all this.

57:53.110 --> 57:56.010
You know I, I knew there

57:53.110 --> 57:56.010
was evil in the world,

57:56.010 --> 57:58.059
just not here in Ornaments.

57:58.059 --> 58:00.289
I mean not for a long time,

57:58.059 --> 58:00.289
at least.

58:00.289 --> 58:02.210
Now it's back and it's all my

58:00.289 --> 58:02.210
fault.

58:02.210 --> 58:04.219
No, you can't blame yourself,

58:02.210 --> 58:04.219
Holly.

58:04.219 --> 58:06.110
Maybe not for the letter that

58:04.219 --> 58:06.110
I wrote when we were kids,

58:06.110 --> 58:08.059
but the one the other night,

58:06.110 --> 58:08.059
I mean.

58:09.090 --> 58:10.159
I don't know.

58:11.219 --> 58:14.190
I always thought that the devil

58:11.219 --> 58:14.190
was just made up, you know?

58:14.190 --> 58:18.230
Like a mascot for the bad

58:14.190 --> 58:18.230
so that people wouldn't sin.

58:18.230 --> 58:22.210
An evil spirit that was just

58:18.230 --> 58:22.210
as fictitious as the one

58:22.210 --> 58:25.039
with the white beard that

58:22.210 --> 58:25.039
I thought I was writing to.

58:25.039 --> 58:27.289
(phone ringing)

58:27.289 --> 58:28.260
Oy.

58:29.230 --> 58:30.130
It's my boss.

58:32.030 --> 58:33.179
Probably calling to fire my ass.

58:33.179 --> 58:35.000
Oh, you don't know that.

58:35.000 --> 58:35.269
Hm.

58:37.070 --> 58:38.099
I'll be fine.

58:38.099 --> 58:40.219
Just, I'm glad you're here with

58:38.099 --> 58:40.219
me.

58:40.219 --> 58:42.070
Okay, I'll, I'll be quick.

58:42.070 --> 58:43.030
Okay.

58:46.079 --> 58:47.159
Pretty crazy night, huh?

58:47.159 --> 58:49.139
KEVINS: More like crazy ratings.

58:50.150 --> 58:51.059
What?

58:51.059 --> 58:52.289
Your segment just went viral.

58:52.289 --> 58:55.210
Over three million views

58:52.289 --> 58:55.210
in just under an hour.

58:55.210 --> 58:56.230
Guess I was wrong, eh?

58:56.230 --> 58:59.210
People don't want feel

58:56.230 --> 58:59.210
good, they want darkness,

58:59.210 --> 59:02.260
blood and gore, so, come

58:59.210 --> 59:02.260
on, let's give it to 'em.

59:02.260 --> 59:04.039
That is disgusting.

59:04.039 --> 59:05.000
You are talking about people

59:05.000 --> 59:07.059
who lost their lives including

59:05.000 --> 59:07.059
my aunt.

59:07.059 --> 59:09.199
Listen, it's time to get

59:07.059 --> 59:09.199
back to investigative, Holly.

59:09.199 --> 59:11.260
Find out who's doing the kills.

59:11.260 --> 59:15.199
Who knows, you may end up

59:11.260 --> 59:15.199
getting poached by Fox News.

59:18.230 --> 59:22.059
I hope scouring the B roll

59:18.230 --> 59:22.059
will help us catch the killer.

59:22.059 --> 59:24.039
What if she's right?

59:24.039 --> 59:25.130
Holly, that it's um,

59:28.090 --> 59:29.110
Satan.

59:29.110 --> 59:31.230
I got a big fat bag of evidence.

59:32.199 --> 59:34.050
Seems to be some kind of a

59:32.199 --> 59:34.050
disguise.

59:34.050 --> 59:35.210
They found it behind Aunt B's.

59:36.199 --> 59:38.099
Got a brown wig.

59:40.139 --> 59:41.289
Camera, glasses.

59:43.010 --> 59:44.219
Bubble gum lip gloss.

59:44.219 --> 59:47.099
Animal print scarf and finally

59:44.219 --> 59:47.099
this,

59:48.059 --> 59:49.170
coral blazer.

59:49.170 --> 59:50.239
Well that's tangerine.

59:53.070 --> 59:54.199
Oh, holy night.

59:55.210 --> 59:57.010
It's definitely tangerine.

59:57.260 --> 59:58.150
There something about these

59:57.260 --> 59:58.150
items

59:58.150 --> 59:59.280
that look familiar to you?

1:00:02.090 --> 1:00:03.239
What are you keeping from me,

1:00:02.090 --> 1:00:03.239
Pringle?

1:00:04.269 --> 1:00:08.099
Those, those are Holly's things.

1:00:08.099 --> 1:00:09.159
What?

1:00:09.159 --> 1:00:12.099
Noel, there's no way Holly did

1:00:09.159 --> 1:00:12.099
this.

1:00:13.130 --> 1:00:14.099
Chris.

1:00:15.190 --> 1:00:16.170
Where is she now?

1:00:17.199 --> 1:00:20.110
(ominous music)

1:00:21.179 --> 1:00:23.010
DEPUTY WREATH: Hands up!

1:00:23.010 --> 1:00:24.269
Oh oh oh!

1:00:24.269 --> 1:00:25.230
Deputy.

1:00:25.230 --> 1:00:28.099
Worst stripper gram ever.

1:00:28.099 --> 1:00:30.019
This isn't a joke.

1:00:30.019 --> 1:00:31.269
Noel told me what you did to

1:00:30.019 --> 1:00:31.269
those people.

1:00:31.269 --> 1:00:33.170
To our sweet little sister.

1:00:33.170 --> 1:00:34.070
What?

1:00:34.070 --> 1:00:34.280
Chad, what is going on here?

1:00:34.280 --> 1:00:37.000
Hands behind your back, Frost.

1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.119
Okay, okay, geez.

1:00:40.230 --> 1:00:41.260
You're under arrest

1:00:43.010 --> 1:00:44.269
for six homicides in Ornaments.

1:00:44.269 --> 1:00:46.159
What are you talking about?

1:00:46.159 --> 1:00:47.239
The bodies that were found

1:00:46.159 --> 1:00:47.239
tonight,

1:00:47.239 --> 1:00:50.260
all of your sister's personal

1:00:47.239 --> 1:00:50.260
belongings were there, Cookie.

1:00:50.260 --> 1:00:52.119
Covered in victim's blood.

1:00:52.119 --> 1:00:53.170
Oh, okay.

1:00:53.170 --> 1:00:54.170
Look, I'm obviously being

1:00:53.170 --> 1:00:54.170
framed.

1:00:54.170 --> 1:00:55.159
Cookie.

1:00:55.159 --> 1:00:56.280
No it was you, wasn't it?

1:00:57.280 --> 1:00:58.269
What?

1:00:58.269 --> 1:01:00.130
You killed mom and dad

1:00:58.269 --> 1:01:00.130
when we were little.

1:01:00.130 --> 1:01:01.179
What?

1:01:01.179 --> 1:01:03.130
All because they wouldn't

1:01:01.179 --> 1:01:03.130
buy you a Darby Dream Wagon.

1:01:03.130 --> 1:01:05.269
And then, and then you came back

1:01:05.269 --> 1:01:08.190
to do a news story so that

1:01:05.269 --> 1:01:08.190
you would be promoted.

1:01:08.190 --> 1:01:09.159
No!

1:01:09.159 --> 1:01:10.280
You're a psychopath!

1:01:10.280 --> 1:01:11.280
I would never do something like

1:01:10.280 --> 1:01:11.280
that.

1:01:11.280 --> 1:01:14.280
I love our parents, Aunt

1:01:11.280 --> 1:01:14.280
Becky, look, I love you.

1:01:14.280 --> 1:01:16.039
Yeah, yeah, and that's why you

1:01:14.280 --> 1:01:16.039
never,

1:01:16.039 --> 1:01:20.239
you know, came back to visit

1:01:16.039 --> 1:01:20.239
or send me a birthday card.

1:01:20.239 --> 1:01:21.130
(Cookie crying)

1:01:21.130 --> 1:01:23.039
Just hear her out, Cookie.

1:01:23.039 --> 1:01:24.010
No!

1:01:25.170 --> 1:01:30.150
The only person that

1:01:25.170 --> 1:01:30.150
you love is your drunk,

1:01:30.150 --> 1:01:34.260
demented, depraved big city

1:01:30.150 --> 1:01:34.260
self!

1:01:35.250 --> 1:01:38.000
Just take her away, Deputy.

1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:39.269
No, this, this is bullshit.

1:01:39.269 --> 1:01:41.090
Cole, I want a lawyer.

1:01:41.090 --> 1:01:42.039
You've got one.

1:01:42.039 --> 1:01:44.260
(hopeful music)

1:01:45.280 --> 1:01:47.230
Passed the bar last fall.

1:01:47.230 --> 1:01:50.170
Cole, the courthouse doesn't

1:01:47.230 --> 1:01:50.170
reopen until after Christmas.

1:01:50.170 --> 1:01:52.039
She can stay with me in the

1:01:50.170 --> 1:01:52.039
meantime.

1:01:52.039 --> 1:01:54.139
She's a maniac, Pringle.

1:01:54.139 --> 1:01:56.099
She's crazy, she killed Joy.

1:01:58.000 --> 1:01:58.269
Uncuff her.

1:01:59.210 --> 1:02:00.179
Now.

1:02:03.230 --> 1:02:06.139
(Cookie crying)

1:02:11.179 --> 1:02:15.079
I hear we're having a slumber

1:02:11.179 --> 1:02:15.079
party?

1:02:15.079 --> 1:02:16.039
Yeah.

1:02:17.239 --> 1:02:19.250
Um, hey Chris.

1:02:21.110 --> 1:02:25.199
Thank you, thank you both,

1:02:21.110 --> 1:02:25.199
for coming to save me.

1:02:26.170 --> 1:02:29.070
We believe you, about Satan.

1:02:29.070 --> 1:02:32.039
Like you believed I wasn't

1:02:29.070 --> 1:02:32.039
seeing things in the manger.

1:02:33.010 --> 1:02:33.260
Yeah.

1:02:33.260 --> 1:02:37.059
Just, I wish my sister believed

1:02:33.260 --> 1:02:37.059
me.

1:02:38.210 --> 1:02:40.030
Hey, you can sleep on the couch,

1:02:40.030 --> 1:02:42.210
or in the master while I'm on

1:02:40.030 --> 1:02:42.210
the couch.

1:02:42.210 --> 1:02:43.219
(distant growling)

1:02:43.219 --> 1:02:44.119
Um guys,

1:02:44.119 --> 1:02:46.199
um that's not Santa, is it?

1:02:46.199 --> 1:02:49.050
(ominous music)

1:02:49.050 --> 1:02:50.110
Oh shit.

1:02:50.110 --> 1:02:51.099
Happy holidays.

1:02:52.210 --> 1:02:55.030
(Satan Claus laughs)

1:02:55.030 --> 1:02:56.000
Chris!

1:02:57.019 --> 1:02:58.130
(Faith screams)

1:02:58.130 --> 1:03:01.019
Oh, is there anything better at

1:02:58.130 --> 1:03:01.019
Christmas

1:03:01.019 --> 1:03:03.099
than a fallen angel.

1:03:03.099 --> 1:03:04.059
(Satan Claus laughs)

1:03:04.059 --> 1:03:05.010
Dad!

1:03:05.010 --> 1:03:05.260
Help!

1:03:05.010 --> 1:03:05.260
Daddy,

1:03:05.260 --> 1:03:07.059
I can't feel my fingers!

1:03:07.059 --> 1:03:08.079
Don't like snow angels!

1:03:08.079 --> 1:03:09.219
Holly, save us!

1:03:10.260 --> 1:03:12.019
Let them go.

1:03:12.019 --> 1:03:15.099
You have done enough damage

1:03:12.019 --> 1:03:15.099
to this town and to my life!

1:03:15.099 --> 1:03:17.179
Oh, did I?

1:03:17.179 --> 1:03:19.110
Oh that's so sad.

1:03:19.110 --> 1:03:22.079
(Faith crying)

1:03:22.079 --> 1:03:23.119
Screw this.

1:03:24.280 --> 1:03:26.230
You have a sweet tooth, honey?

1:03:26.230 --> 1:03:29.139
Be careful, you might get a

1:03:26.230 --> 1:03:29.139
little hippy.

1:03:29.139 --> 1:03:30.289
It's over, asshole.

1:03:31.260 --> 1:03:34.019
(Holly yells)

1:03:34.019 --> 1:03:34.269
(candycanes stabbing flesh)

1:03:34.269 --> 1:03:35.230
Oh, come on!

1:03:36.159 --> 1:03:38.059
You, you just blinded me.

1:03:39.070 --> 1:03:40.030
Oh, ow!

1:03:42.269 --> 1:03:44.230
Oh no, look at that, I'm totally

1:03:42.269 --> 1:03:44.230
fine.

1:03:44.230 --> 1:03:47.019
(Satan Claus laughs)

1:03:47.019 --> 1:03:48.139
What do you want?

1:03:48.139 --> 1:03:50.119
What do I want?

1:03:50.119 --> 1:03:53.119
You wrote me, remember?

1:03:53.119 --> 1:03:56.159
You gave me Christmas.

1:03:57.130 --> 1:04:01.150
Which by the way, is a

1:03:57.130 --> 1:04:01.150
fabulous gift, sweetheart.

1:04:01.150 --> 1:04:02.239
I am having a ball.

1:04:04.090 --> 1:04:05.090
(Chris screams)

1:04:05.090 --> 1:04:06.280
CHRIS: Get out of here, Holly!

1:04:06.280 --> 1:04:09.139
(tense music)

1:04:10.269 --> 1:04:12.219
(intense music)

1:04:12.219 --> 1:04:14.099
(Holly grunts)

1:04:14.099 --> 1:04:15.150
Run Holly!

1:04:15.150 --> 1:04:17.030
To my place!

1:04:17.030 --> 1:04:18.139
We'll be fine, just go quick.

1:04:18.139 --> 1:04:21.280
It is the most wonderful time of

1:04:18.139 --> 1:04:21.280
the year.

1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:23.230
(Satan Claus laughs)

1:04:23.230 --> 1:04:26.070
(dark music)

1:04:30.150 --> 1:04:33.079
(Holly panting)

1:04:35.030 --> 1:04:37.219
(Holly crying)

1:04:43.039 --> 1:04:44.090
(intense music)

1:04:43.039 --> 1:04:44.090
(Holly gasps)

1:04:44.090 --> 1:04:46.130
CHRIS: Holly, it's us.

1:04:47.139 --> 1:04:49.039
Come in, come in.

1:04:49.039 --> 1:04:49.289
Oh my God, are you all right?

1:04:49.289 --> 1:04:51.099
I was so scared.

1:04:53.130 --> 1:04:54.150
Is that fiend gone?

1:04:54.150 --> 1:04:55.119
For now.

1:04:56.079 --> 1:04:57.179
Exactly.

1:04:57.179 --> 1:04:58.210
For now.

1:04:58.210 --> 1:05:01.150
We can't defeat Satan

1:04:58.210 --> 1:05:01.150
physically.

1:05:01.150 --> 1:05:04.030
Question is, is how?

1:05:04.030 --> 1:05:06.260
Let's just get you patched up

1:05:04.030 --> 1:05:06.260
first, okay?

1:05:06.260 --> 1:05:07.230
Okay.

1:05:12.019 --> 1:05:13.260
- Hey.

1:05:13.260 --> 1:05:15.190
Are you sure you don't

1:05:13.260 --> 1:05:15.190
mind taking the couch?

1:05:15.190 --> 1:05:17.230
Oh, yeah yeah, no no, it's no

1:05:15.190 --> 1:05:17.230
problem.

1:05:18.190 --> 1:05:20.239
Thanks for everything this week,

1:05:18.190 --> 1:05:20.239
Chris.

1:05:20.239 --> 1:05:23.159
You've been, you've been so

1:05:20.239 --> 1:05:23.159
great.

1:05:23.159 --> 1:05:25.010
Especially considering all that

1:05:23.159 --> 1:05:25.010
crap

1:05:25.010 --> 1:05:27.260
that I put you through

1:05:25.010 --> 1:05:27.260
when we were younger.

1:05:27.260 --> 1:05:30.070
Holly, we're dealing with a

1:05:27.260 --> 1:05:30.070
holiday devil.

1:05:30.070 --> 1:05:32.250
Surviving together is

1:05:30.070 --> 1:05:32.250
all that matters now.

1:05:32.250 --> 1:05:36.190
So, why don't you dream of

1:05:32.250 --> 1:05:36.190
sugarplum fairies for me, okay?

1:05:38.059 --> 1:05:39.039
Okay.

1:05:41.130 --> 1:05:43.010
Oh um, um.

1:05:43.010 --> 1:05:45.139
No kissing, at least not this

1:05:43.010 --> 1:05:45.139
early on.

1:05:47.130 --> 1:05:49.050
Yeah, okay, cool.

1:05:49.050 --> 1:05:52.190
You know what, I, actually I get

1:05:49.050 --> 1:05:52.190
it.

1:05:53.199 --> 1:05:55.010
Um.

1:05:55.010 --> 1:05:56.050
(Holly laughs)

1:05:56.050 --> 1:05:58.250
How bout we high five instead?

1:05:58.250 --> 1:06:00.230
Uh, sure.

1:06:00.230 --> 1:06:01.179
Yeah?

1:06:01.179 --> 1:06:02.260
Sure.

1:06:01.179 --> 1:06:02.260
Okay.

1:06:02.260 --> 1:06:03.210
All right.

1:06:03.210 --> 1:06:04.170
High five.

1:06:06.059 --> 1:06:08.139
Um, goodnight Chris Pringle.

1:06:10.199 --> 1:06:12.000
Night Holly Frost.

1:06:15.119 --> 1:06:16.079
Hm.

1:06:28.170 --> 1:06:31.280
(notifications dinging)

1:06:52.250 --> 1:06:53.269
Let me guess.

1:06:56.170 --> 1:06:57.150
Santa's reindeer?

1:07:01.070 --> 1:07:03.130
I know it probably seems silly

1:07:01.070 --> 1:07:03.130
but,

1:07:04.280 --> 1:07:08.139
when I lost my mom to the hot

1:07:04.280 --> 1:07:08.139
air balloon,

1:07:10.030 --> 1:07:11.139
I became depressed.

1:07:12.099 --> 1:07:15.269
I needed to find faith to

1:07:12.099 --> 1:07:15.269
continue on.

1:07:15.269 --> 1:07:19.070
I mean, living in Ornaments,

1:07:15.269 --> 1:07:19.070
Santa seemed like a good start.

1:07:21.210 --> 1:07:25.110
I put these out every year

1:07:21.210 --> 1:07:25.110
and someone eats them.

1:07:25.110 --> 1:07:27.119
Sure, maybe it's my dad but,

1:07:28.099 --> 1:07:30.030
I like to think it's the

1:07:28.099 --> 1:07:30.030
reindeer.

1:07:33.199 --> 1:07:36.039
O-M-Gingerbread.

1:07:36.039 --> 1:07:37.179
What is it?

1:07:37.179 --> 1:07:41.289
If Satan is real, then who's

1:07:37.179 --> 1:07:41.289
to say that Santa isn't?

1:07:41.289 --> 1:07:43.090
I can't believe my lips

1:07:41.289 --> 1:07:43.090
are about to say this,

1:07:43.090 --> 1:07:46.130
but what if I wrote to

1:07:43.090 --> 1:07:46.130
Santa to ask his advice

1:07:46.130 --> 1:07:49.050
on how to get this horny

1:07:46.130 --> 1:07:49.050
hell raiser out of Ornaments?

1:07:49.050 --> 1:07:50.110
A, a letter to Santa!

1:07:50.110 --> 1:07:51.059
Yes!

1:07:51.059 --> 1:07:52.000
I'll get a pen.

1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:54.039
And I will get some liquid

1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:54.039
courage.

1:07:54.039 --> 1:07:55.269
(both squealing)

1:07:55.269 --> 1:07:58.019
Dear Santa.

1:07:59.099 --> 1:08:04.119
Hey, it's been 20,

1:07:59.099 --> 1:08:04.119
oh scratch that.

1:08:04.119 --> 1:08:09.139
21 years since we last spoke.

1:08:10.090 --> 1:08:15.099
I need to bring back joy to

1:08:10.090 --> 1:08:15.099
Ornaments and take down Satan.

1:08:18.199 --> 1:08:23.210
How the, fudge, do I do that?

1:08:25.270 --> 1:08:29.260
Love, Holly Frost.

1:08:34.050 --> 1:08:35.090
Something's not right.

1:08:38.180 --> 1:08:39.250
Winters.

1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:44.069
It says Santa, right?

1:08:48.029 --> 1:08:49.050
Here goes nothin'.

1:08:54.069 --> 1:08:56.060
Now we just have to get it to

1:08:54.069 --> 1:08:56.060
Santa.

1:08:56.060 --> 1:08:57.210
Oh, but the bakery's closed

1:08:56.060 --> 1:08:57.210
tonight.

1:09:00.170 --> 1:09:02.210
I know what that look means.

1:09:03.220 --> 1:09:06.239
I have a plan, Miss Winters.

1:09:08.010 --> 1:09:10.220
(hopeful music)

1:09:24.180 --> 1:09:27.100
(magical music)

1:09:38.069 --> 1:09:39.189
Oh my God, Faith, is everything

1:09:38.069 --> 1:09:39.189
okay?

1:09:39.189 --> 1:09:40.289
Better than okay.

1:09:40.289 --> 1:09:41.250
What?

1:09:41.250 --> 1:09:43.189
I found this by my half eaten

1:09:41.250 --> 1:09:43.189
carrots.

1:09:43.189 --> 1:09:44.250
He wrote back.

1:09:44.250 --> 1:09:45.199
What?

1:09:44.250 --> 1:09:45.199
Santa's real.

1:09:45.199 --> 1:09:46.180
Open it, open it.

1:09:46.180 --> 1:09:49.090
(Holly squeals)

1:09:51.140 --> 1:09:53.250
Dear Holly, it's nice to hear

1:09:51.140 --> 1:09:53.250
from you.

1:09:53.250 --> 1:09:57.250
If you help a friend in need

1:09:53.250 --> 1:09:57.250
and find a song in your soul,

1:09:57.250 --> 1:09:59.119
you can light up the world.

1:09:59.119 --> 1:10:02.029
Ho ho ho, Santa.

1:10:04.100 --> 1:10:06.100
This is straight up gibberish.

1:10:06.100 --> 1:10:07.260
No.

1:10:07.260 --> 1:10:09.109
No, I think it's a riddle.

1:10:09.109 --> 1:10:11.010
I love riddles.

1:10:11.010 --> 1:10:14.090
Oh God, Santa wrote me a

1:10:11.010 --> 1:10:14.090
fudging riddle to abolish Satan?

1:10:14.090 --> 1:10:15.079
Okay, it looks like it's written

1:10:15.079 --> 1:10:16.039
in three different sections.

1:10:16.039 --> 1:10:17.260
So we should start at the

1:10:16.039 --> 1:10:17.260
beginning.

1:10:17.260 --> 1:10:19.060
If you help a friend in need.

1:10:19.060 --> 1:10:20.199
Do you have a friend in need?

1:10:21.159 --> 1:10:22.279
I don't have any friends.

1:10:23.210 --> 1:10:24.189
(Holly gasps)

1:10:24.189 --> 1:10:27.090
Except for Chad.

1:10:27.090 --> 1:10:29.279
(Chad sighing)

1:10:32.260 --> 1:10:34.079
Oh, hey.

1:10:34.079 --> 1:10:36.220
I'm glad you're not in the

1:10:34.079 --> 1:10:36.220
slammer.

1:10:36.220 --> 1:10:37.250
Hey, what's going on Uncle Chad?

1:10:37.250 --> 1:10:40.189
Why are you tossing out

1:10:37.250 --> 1:10:40.189
all those pretty pies.

1:10:40.189 --> 1:10:43.199
Well, everyone's afraid

1:10:40.189 --> 1:10:43.199
to leave their homes.

1:10:43.199 --> 1:10:45.060
They think Holly's a mass

1:10:43.199 --> 1:10:45.060
murderess,

1:10:45.060 --> 1:10:49.069
so Sheriff Noel canceled the

1:10:45.060 --> 1:10:49.069
rest of Christmas Wonder.

1:10:49.069 --> 1:10:51.250
Including tonight's caroling

1:10:49.069 --> 1:10:51.250
concert at the bakery.

1:10:53.189 --> 1:10:57.239
Holly, Santa said to find

1:10:53.189 --> 1:10:57.239
a song within your soul.

1:10:58.260 --> 1:11:01.270
Maybe Santa wants the concert to

1:10:58.260 --> 1:11:01.270
go on.

1:11:01.270 --> 1:11:04.159
I think that you're right.

1:11:04.159 --> 1:11:06.039
Ah, shit, he's early.

1:11:06.039 --> 1:11:07.050
Who?

1:11:07.050 --> 1:11:08.000
Who's early?

1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:10.119
Faith, makeover.

1:11:10.119 --> 1:11:13.060
(cheerful music)

1:11:16.079 --> 1:11:19.050
(romantic music)

1:11:19.050 --> 1:11:20.000
Wow.

1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:20.260
Chad.

1:11:21.199 --> 1:11:22.189
You look different.

1:11:23.180 --> 1:11:24.289
I do?

1:11:24.289 --> 1:11:26.170
Uh, what are you doing here?

1:11:26.170 --> 1:11:29.250
Uh, your niece called, said

1:11:26.170 --> 1:11:29.250
there was an emergency.

1:11:29.250 --> 1:11:31.029
Faithy, what?

1:11:31.029 --> 1:11:32.220
Uh, John.

1:11:32.220 --> 1:11:37.239
Chad had something that

1:11:32.220 --> 1:11:37.239
he would like to ask you.

1:11:39.069 --> 1:11:40.020
I do?

1:11:40.020 --> 1:11:41.060
Mm-hm.

1:11:41.060 --> 1:11:46.069
Uh, maybe, would you like

1:11:41.060 --> 1:11:46.069
to go for a bite sometime?

1:11:49.079 --> 1:11:51.020
What took you so long, Chady?

1:11:52.119 --> 1:11:54.020
I thought you weren't

1:11:52.119 --> 1:11:54.020
interested.

1:11:54.020 --> 1:11:56.159
I thought you weren't

1:11:54.020 --> 1:11:56.159
interested.

1:11:56.159 --> 1:11:57.109
Aw.

1:11:57.109 --> 1:11:58.010
Okay, great.

1:11:58.010 --> 1:11:59.000
So you both like each other.

1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:00.039
Now we have to get back

1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:00.039
to saving Christmas.

1:12:00.039 --> 1:12:02.189
Chad, send an email blast

1:12:00.039 --> 1:12:02.189
to all of your customers.

1:12:02.189 --> 1:12:05.060
Tell them that the event

1:12:02.189 --> 1:12:05.060
her tonight is uncancelled.

1:12:05.060 --> 1:12:10.069
And, ah, everybody who

1:12:05.060 --> 1:12:10.069
attends gets free pie.

1:12:10.270 --> 1:12:12.170
I don't know if I have enough

1:12:10.270 --> 1:12:12.170
filling.

1:12:12.170 --> 1:12:14.170
Oh darling, I know a hot farmer

1:12:14.170 --> 1:12:17.109
who might have a few

1:12:14.170 --> 1:12:17.109
extra apples lying around.

1:12:17.109 --> 1:12:18.189
Hm, I'm on it.

1:12:18.189 --> 1:12:20.029
Wanna give me a hand, Chady?

1:12:20.029 --> 1:12:20.289
Sure.

1:12:22.210 --> 1:12:23.180
Okay.

1:12:28.020 --> 1:12:30.260
(both squealing)

1:12:31.229 --> 1:12:33.189
Okay Faith, now it's time

1:12:31.229 --> 1:12:33.189
to find Sheriff Noel.

1:12:33.189 --> 1:12:35.050
Tell him that he and the other

1:12:33.189 --> 1:12:35.050
carolers

1:12:35.050 --> 1:12:37.220
need to be ready to rock at

1:12:35.050 --> 1:12:37.220
seven o'clock.

1:12:38.239 --> 1:12:41.199
But, Sheriff Noel thinks

1:12:38.239 --> 1:12:41.199
you chopped up his sister.

1:12:41.199 --> 1:12:43.079
Right, okay, um.

1:12:43.079 --> 1:12:47.229
Tell him that if this doesn't

1:12:43.079 --> 1:12:47.229
work, he can arrest me.

1:12:47.229 --> 1:12:49.170
Now go, go, go go go.

1:12:49.170 --> 1:12:50.149
Go go go go go!

1:12:50.149 --> 1:12:51.079
Okay.

1:12:55.060 --> 1:12:57.140
Help a friend in need.

1:12:59.079 --> 1:13:00.039
Nailed it.

1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:03.050
FAITH: The free pie is here,

1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:03.050
everyone.

1:13:06.050 --> 1:13:07.180
Hey, Sheriff.

1:13:07.180 --> 1:13:08.149
You ready to belt?

1:13:11.250 --> 1:13:13.010
Oh what is this, like Christmas

1:13:11.250 --> 1:13:13.010
charades?

1:13:13.010 --> 1:13:16.159
Look, I'm sorry, we do not

1:13:13.010 --> 1:13:16.159
have time for that right now.

1:13:16.159 --> 1:13:19.079
Sorry, do you think that

1:13:16.159 --> 1:13:19.079
I'm the Christmas killer?

1:13:20.289 --> 1:13:22.050
Hello?

1:13:22.050 --> 1:13:25.250
Uh, Noel and the other carolers

1:13:22.050 --> 1:13:25.250
came down with laryngitis?

1:13:27.010 --> 1:13:29.050
In the last two minutes?

1:13:29.050 --> 1:13:30.270
What are the odds, right?

1:13:30.270 --> 1:13:32.090
Ugh!

1:13:32.090 --> 1:13:33.260
Satan's the odds.

1:13:35.010 --> 1:13:39.250
I'd do it Holly, but I have

1:13:35.010 --> 1:13:39.250
a terrible singing voice.

1:13:39.250 --> 1:13:42.020
The concert's canceled, again.

1:13:42.020 --> 1:13:43.079
No, no no no no.

1:13:43.079 --> 1:13:46.260
Look, somebody has to, you

1:13:43.079 --> 1:13:46.260
know, like sing from the soul.

1:13:48.210 --> 1:13:51.029
And I think I know who

1:13:48.210 --> 1:13:51.029
that someone has to be.

1:13:53.119 --> 1:13:54.140
Hey everybody.

1:13:54.140 --> 1:13:55.199
Hi, hello.

1:13:55.199 --> 1:13:57.199
Can everybody hear me okay?

1:13:57.199 --> 1:14:00.170
We don't want to see or

1:13:57.199 --> 1:14:00.170
hear you, Christmas killer.

1:14:00.170 --> 1:14:02.090
Oh, okay, wow.

1:14:04.100 --> 1:14:08.010
Look, I'm here tonight

1:14:04.100 --> 1:14:08.010
desperate to bring back

1:14:08.010 --> 1:14:13.020
Ornaments' wonderful spirit,

1:14:08.010 --> 1:14:13.020
which Satan has stolen.

1:14:13.279 --> 1:14:15.140
The woman speaks the truth!

1:14:16.289 --> 1:14:19.180
Cookie, I've done a lot of

1:14:16.289 --> 1:14:19.180
thinking

1:14:19.180 --> 1:14:22.149
about how important family is.

1:14:22.149 --> 1:14:25.060
I mean, it's what Christmas

1:14:22.149 --> 1:14:25.060
time is all about.

1:14:26.100 --> 1:14:28.020
I've been a terrible little

1:14:26.100 --> 1:14:28.020
sister to you

1:14:28.020 --> 1:14:32.119
and I really hope that

1:14:28.020 --> 1:14:32.119
it's not too late for us.

1:14:34.039 --> 1:14:35.069
I need you to see.

1:14:37.029 --> 1:14:41.010
I need you all to see

1:14:37.029 --> 1:14:41.010
that people can change.

1:14:42.010 --> 1:14:43.039
Hit it, Faith.

Thank you, Cookie.

1:16:11.270 --> 1:16:12.239
I love you.

Say you'll come home.

1:16:15.199 --> 1:16:17.020
Stay for Christmas.

1:16:17.020 --> 1:16:19.130
I would like that, very much.

1:16:20.079 --> 1:16:22.229
But, I think that I'm,

1:16:22.229 --> 1:16:25.039
I'm gonna have to ask my cute

1:16:22.229 --> 1:16:25.039
lawyer.

1:16:26.100 --> 1:16:27.149
(people screaming)

Oh my God!

1:16:28.100 --> 1:16:31.039
(people gasping)

1:16:31.260 --> 1:16:33.100
Oh no.

1:16:33.100 --> 1:16:37.109
It's Carol, from Carol's

1:16:33.100 --> 1:16:37.109
electronics.

1:16:37.109 --> 1:16:39.270
For real?

1:16:37.109 --> 1:16:39.270
It's Carol?

1:16:39.270 --> 1:16:42.029
I just saw her this week.

1:16:39.270 --> 1:16:42.029
It's like a new nightmare.

1:16:42.029 --> 1:16:44.149
Satan is toying with us.

1:16:44.149 --> 1:16:46.159
We have to keep the Christmas

1:16:44.149 --> 1:16:46.159
spirit

1:16:46.159 --> 1:16:48.170
in order to defeat that devil.

1:16:51.079 --> 1:16:52.050
I have a plan.

1:16:53.250 --> 1:16:56.250
(determined music)

1:17:02.279 --> 1:17:04.159
It's on, bitch.

1:17:10.180 --> 1:17:13.100
(ominous music)

1:17:22.050 --> 1:17:24.119
Light up the world.

1:17:24.119 --> 1:17:27.069
Of course, daddy's tree lighting

1:17:24.119 --> 1:17:27.069
ceremony.

1:17:27.069 --> 1:17:29.000
You're a genius, Holly.

1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:30.119
There she is.

1:17:30.119 --> 1:17:32.109
Kevins, what are you doing here?

1:17:32.109 --> 1:17:34.000
Your friend Chad posted that

1:17:32.109 --> 1:17:34.000
video

1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:35.229
of your speech and song last

1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:35.229
night.

1:17:35.229 --> 1:17:37.020
Sorry I ever doubted you.

1:17:37.020 --> 1:17:38.279
That anchor job is your.

1:17:38.279 --> 1:17:41.119
Christie's already cleared

1:17:38.279 --> 1:17:41.119
out her dressing room.

1:17:41.119 --> 1:17:44.149
She cried, it was uh, pregnancy

1:17:41.119 --> 1:17:44.149
hormones.

1:17:44.149 --> 1:17:46.079
That's very kind of you, but,

1:17:46.079 --> 1:17:48.079
I mean not the Christie

1:17:46.079 --> 1:17:48.079
part, that's horrible,

1:17:48.079 --> 1:17:50.180
but I'm not interested.

1:17:50.180 --> 1:17:52.100
Look, there are more

1:17:50.180 --> 1:17:52.100
important things in the world

1:17:52.100 --> 1:17:54.279
than being Connie Chung.

1:17:54.279 --> 1:17:58.210
Oh, and Kevins, you're

1:17:54.279 --> 1:17:58.210
gonna want to film this.

1:17:58.210 --> 1:18:00.069
Okay.

1:18:00.069 --> 1:18:02.100
Chris, hey, Chris.

1:18:03.180 --> 1:18:04.189
Where's the rest of the town?

1:18:04.189 --> 1:18:06.180
Satan's gonna be here soon.

1:18:06.180 --> 1:18:07.199
Maybe they're just late.

1:18:09.039 --> 1:18:11.149
Or maybe I was just less

1:18:09.039 --> 1:18:11.149
convincing than we thought.

1:18:12.159 --> 1:18:13.210
We should get started.

1:18:13.210 --> 1:18:14.199
Yeah, okay.

1:18:15.170 --> 1:18:17.180
Evening, Ornaments.

1:18:17.180 --> 1:18:20.279
May be small, but we are mighty.

1:18:20.279 --> 1:18:23.119
Right?

1:18:20.279 --> 1:18:23.119
(crowd cheering)

1:18:23.119 --> 1:18:26.050
Okay, here goes nothing.

1:18:27.170 --> 1:18:28.279
We're ready for you, Satan!

1:18:30.159 --> 1:18:32.029
Yeah.

1:18:32.029 --> 1:18:34.189
(tense music)

1:18:37.090 --> 1:18:38.210
Show yourself!

1:18:40.189 --> 1:18:41.140
(intense music)

1:18:41.140 --> 1:18:42.279
Happy holidays!

1:18:44.270 --> 1:18:45.220
(Satan Claus laughs)

1:18:45.220 --> 1:18:46.250
We can't let that demon ruin our

1:18:45.220 --> 1:18:46.250
joy,

1:18:46.250 --> 1:18:48.079
so let's light up this tree!

1:18:49.239 --> 1:18:51.050
One, two, three!

1:18:54.220 --> 1:18:57.069
(ominous music)

1:18:57.069 --> 1:18:58.270
(crowd screaming)

1:18:58.270 --> 1:19:01.210
It's beginning to look

1:18:58.270 --> 1:19:01.210
a lot like Christmas.

1:19:01.210 --> 1:19:04.210
Every one in the town is up

1:19:01.210 --> 1:19:04.210
there.

1:19:04.210 --> 1:19:07.199
That's why people didn't

1:19:04.210 --> 1:19:07.199
come to the ceremony.

1:19:07.199 --> 1:19:08.210
Alive.

1:19:08.210 --> 1:19:10.069
Santa's fix didn't work.

1:19:11.270 --> 1:19:12.239
Satan won.

1:19:13.189 --> 1:19:14.149
Woo!

1:19:16.079 --> 1:19:19.149
All because I couldn't

1:19:16.079 --> 1:19:19.149
fudging spell at seven?

1:19:22.250 --> 1:19:23.289
That's what he meant.

1:19:24.260 --> 1:19:26.239
The last part of Santa's riddle.

1:19:29.029 --> 1:19:31.210
You can stop this whole

1:19:29.029 --> 1:19:31.210
charade right now, Satan.

1:19:31.210 --> 1:19:34.159
Because we are not afraid of

1:19:31.210 --> 1:19:34.159
you.

1:19:34.159 --> 1:19:37.100
Are you sure, Frost?

1:19:37.100 --> 1:19:39.039
It's Winters again, dick.

1:19:39.039 --> 1:19:40.189
No one cares.

1:19:40.189 --> 1:19:42.189
I never meant to write

1:19:40.189 --> 1:19:42.189
you all those years ago.

1:19:42.189 --> 1:19:46.199
And we are taking back

1:19:42.189 --> 1:19:46.199
Christmas because it's ours.

1:19:46.199 --> 1:19:47.180
Yeah!

1:19:46.199 --> 1:19:47.180
Woo!

1:19:47.180 --> 1:19:51.140
It's rude to take back a gift,

1:19:47.180 --> 1:19:51.140
sugarplum.

1:19:51.140 --> 1:19:53.189
You were raised better than

1:19:51.140 --> 1:19:53.189
that.

1:19:53.189 --> 1:19:56.220
Oh no, wait a second, I

1:19:53.189 --> 1:19:56.220
totally killed your parents.

1:19:56.220 --> 1:19:59.010
(Satan Claus laughs)

1:19:59.010 --> 1:19:59.289
Over the past few days,

1:19:59.289 --> 1:20:02.210
I have rediscovered the

1:19:59.289 --> 1:20:02.210
Christmas spirit.

1:20:02.210 --> 1:20:07.069
I believe in hot cocoa,

1:20:02.210 --> 1:20:07.069
candy canes, caroling,

1:20:07.069 --> 1:20:08.159
Christmas presents, ginger bread

1:20:07.069 --> 1:20:08.159
houses.

1:20:08.159 --> 1:20:10.010
(Satan Claus gagging)

1:20:10.010 --> 1:20:15.039
I believe in snow men,

1:20:10.010 --> 1:20:15.039
snow women, snow theys.

1:20:15.039 --> 1:20:17.000
I believe in the goodness of

1:20:15.039 --> 1:20:17.000
people.

1:20:18.109 --> 1:20:19.159
I believe in love.

1:20:20.170 --> 1:20:25.149
But there is one thing

1:20:20.170 --> 1:20:25.149
that I do not believe in.

1:20:25.149 --> 1:20:27.250
And that's you.

1:20:27.250 --> 1:20:29.130
What?

1:20:29.130 --> 1:20:30.149
Time to light this mother up.

1:20:30.149 --> 1:20:31.109
No!

1:20:33.159 --> 1:20:34.119
No, no.

1:20:35.109 --> 1:20:36.279
No no no no!

1:20:36.279 --> 1:20:38.109
No!

1:20:38.109 --> 1:20:40.229
Think of Christmas wonder!

1:20:42.020 --> 1:20:43.020
Go, link arms!

1:20:43.020 --> 1:20:46.159
(Satan Claus screaming)

1:21:08.170 --> 1:21:11.109
(peaceful music)

1:21:17.170 --> 1:21:19.069
FAITH: It's snowing in here!

1:21:24.170 --> 1:21:25.130
Oh my.

1:21:28.239 --> 1:21:31.090
Everyone's alive again.

1:21:31.090 --> 1:21:34.020
It's a Christmas miracle.

1:21:34.020 --> 1:21:37.079
(Faith giggling)

1:21:37.079 --> 1:21:38.100
You did it, Holly.

1:21:38.100 --> 1:21:39.170
We did it!

1:21:42.020 --> 1:21:43.180
I have something to confess.

1:21:44.140 --> 1:21:45.239
Oh, the leather's too much.

1:21:45.239 --> 1:21:47.010
You're dumping me.

1:21:47.010 --> 1:21:47.229
No, no.

1:21:47.229 --> 1:21:49.210
My real name is Johannes

1:21:47.229 --> 1:21:49.210
Strudel,

1:21:49.210 --> 1:21:51.069
and I'm the Prince of Mocano.

1:21:52.090 --> 1:21:53.149
You mean Monaco?

1:21:53.149 --> 1:21:54.140
No, Mocano.

1:21:54.140 --> 1:21:57.010
It's a small country

1:21:54.140 --> 1:21:57.010
in West Eastern Europe.

1:21:57.010 --> 1:21:59.109
I came to Ornaments to be

1:21:57.010 --> 1:21:59.109
ordinary.

1:21:59.109 --> 1:22:00.270
To plant apple trees.

1:22:01.210 --> 1:22:04.180
But, I have found my prince.

1:22:04.180 --> 1:22:05.289
I'm ready to go home.

1:22:08.060 --> 1:22:10.050
(Chad gasps)

1:22:10.050 --> 1:22:12.149
Will you marry me, Chady?

1:22:12.149 --> 1:22:13.140
Me?

1:22:13.140 --> 1:22:15.000
A prince's prince?

1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:16.189
Yeah.

1:22:16.189 --> 1:22:19.250
But, we've only been dating like

1:22:16.189 --> 1:22:19.250
one day.

1:22:19.250 --> 1:22:20.270
Yeah.

1:22:20.270 --> 1:22:22.060
What am I saying, I do.

1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:25.210
(hopeful music)

1:22:33.140 --> 1:22:34.289
Every- I'm engaged!

1:22:34.289 --> 1:22:36.069
(women cheering)

1:22:36.069 --> 1:22:39.010
(cheerful music)

1:22:47.239 --> 1:22:48.250
Kevins.

1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:51.010
Sam.

1:22:54.130 --> 1:22:57.220
All it took was having a

1:22:54.130 --> 1:22:57.220
little faith in Christmas.

1:23:00.170 --> 1:23:02.170
Hi.

1:23:02.170 --> 1:23:06.029
So, I'm like, I'm really

1:23:02.170 --> 1:23:06.029
sorry for getting you killed

1:23:06.029 --> 1:23:08.260
by the angel of darkness and

1:23:06.029 --> 1:23:08.260
for like being such an asshole.

1:23:08.260 --> 1:23:10.170
It's no sweat.

1:23:10.170 --> 1:23:14.020
Maybe we can try that van thing

1:23:10.170 --> 1:23:14.020
again.

1:23:15.260 --> 1:23:19.220
I'll take down my wife's

1:23:15.260 --> 1:23:19.220
posters and kittens.

1:23:21.020 --> 1:23:23.270
Yeah, um, I kind of.

1:23:23.270 --> 1:23:24.239
Holly?

1:23:26.109 --> 1:23:27.159
Chris, what?

1:23:27.159 --> 1:23:28.159
What is this?

1:23:28.159 --> 1:23:30.109
Hopefully it's not a hand.

1:23:30.109 --> 1:23:31.090
(Holly giggles)

1:23:31.090 --> 1:23:33.079
Something you deserved a long

1:23:31.090 --> 1:23:33.079
time ago.

1:23:34.029 --> 1:23:35.079
(Holly gasps)

1:23:35.079 --> 1:23:36.109
Oh my God.

1:23:39.130 --> 1:23:41.159
A Darby Dream Wagon?

1:23:42.159 --> 1:23:43.189
How did you know?

1:23:43.189 --> 1:23:45.149
A little Christmas birdie told

1:23:43.189 --> 1:23:45.149
me.

1:23:46.159 --> 1:23:48.079
(women laughing)

1:23:48.079 --> 1:23:50.010
Chris, it's perfect.

1:23:51.279 --> 1:23:53.020
Thank you.

1:23:53.020 --> 1:23:55.029
Whoa whoa, uh.

1:23:55.029 --> 1:23:56.239
We're still not gonna?

1:23:56.239 --> 1:23:58.119
I just,

1:23:58.119 --> 1:23:59.140
I thought,

1:23:59.140 --> 1:24:02.039
I thought maybe we were

1:23:59.140 --> 1:24:02.039
like in the final act, so.

1:24:03.289 --> 1:24:05.220
Uh.

1:24:05.220 --> 1:24:08.000
It's just, the next woman I do

1:24:05.220 --> 1:24:08.000
that with,

1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:10.159
I want to be the woman I marry.

1:24:10.159 --> 1:24:13.039
Are you ready to come home,

1:24:10.159 --> 1:24:13.039
be with me?

1:24:13.039 --> 1:24:14.260
Be a mother to Faith?

1:24:16.050 --> 1:24:17.039
Chris, I.

1:24:18.239 --> 1:24:20.050
I am ready to love.

1:24:21.140 --> 1:24:25.010
But, you're so not the one.

1:24:25.250 --> 1:24:28.069
I, I may have rediscovered

1:24:25.250 --> 1:24:28.069
the holiday spirit

1:24:28.069 --> 1:24:31.250
and the Christmas candle

1:24:28.069 --> 1:24:31.250
inside my heart but,

1:24:31.250 --> 1:24:35.210
that doesn't mean I want to

1:24:31.250 --> 1:24:35.210
be with somebody so, bland.

1:24:35.210 --> 1:24:39.010
Hot, like so, you're so hot.

1:24:39.010 --> 1:24:41.289
But I mean, bland.

1:24:42.250 --> 1:24:44.029
And I don't want to be anyone's

1:24:42.250 --> 1:24:44.029
mom.

1:24:44.029 --> 1:24:46.159
Like, ever, so.

1:24:46.159 --> 1:24:48.039
Yeah.

1:24:48.039 --> 1:24:48.289
Excuse me.

1:24:48.289 --> 1:24:50.239
Uh, Cookie, can you?

1:24:50.239 --> 1:24:51.189
Sure.

1:24:50.239 --> 1:24:51.189
Thanks.

1:24:51.189 --> 1:24:52.210
Thank you.

1:24:52.210 --> 1:24:54.079
Uh, where is that?

1:24:55.140 --> 1:24:58.079
Ah, not today.

1:24:58.079 --> 1:24:59.189
Ah, Goldman.

1:24:59.189 --> 1:25:02.220
Hey, I'm uh, ready for that

1:24:59.189 --> 1:25:02.220
dance now.

1:25:04.010 --> 1:25:05.149
And this.

1:25:05.149 --> 1:25:08.000
(upbeat music)

1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:09.100
Woo,

1:25:09.100 --> 1:25:10.060
wow.

1:25:11.090 --> 1:25:15.210
Um, Danica, do you swing?

1:25:15.210 --> 1:25:16.260
Funny you should ask.

1:25:18.060 --> 1:25:19.029
We do.

1:25:20.170 --> 1:25:22.029
What do you say?

1:25:25.159 --> 1:25:28.090
God bless us, everyone!

1:25:28.090 --> 1:25:29.199
Except Satan.

1:25:29.199 --> 1:25:32.109
