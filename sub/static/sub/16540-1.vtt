WEBVTT

00:20.788 --> 00:24.596
10 centimeters. Now, on this next one,
I want you to push with all you've got.

00:29.964 --> 00:32.033
There we go.

00:38.305 --> 00:41.543
Let me see my son.

00:41.576 --> 00:44.880
I want to see my baby. Where is he?

00:46.953 --> 00:49.724
There is no baby, dear.

00:52.796 --> 00:55.563
But I heard him.

00:55.596 --> 00:58.465
I heard him cry.

01:19.018 --> 01:22.322
I want my baby.

01:22.356 --> 01:24.559
Where's my baby?

01:24.592 --> 01:26.928
Baby... baby...

01:54.121 --> 01:55.857
What's your name?

01:57.824 --> 02:00.394
What's your name?

02:54.747 --> 02:56.483
<i>Do you ever think your dreams</i>

02:56.517 --> 02:59.152
<i>are trying to tell you something?</i>

02:59.186 --> 03:01.589
<i>We all dream, and when we dream,</i>

03:01.621 --> 03:05.392
<i>we think our dreams belong
to us and us alone.</i>

03:05.425 --> 03:08.495
<i>What if we're wrong?</i>

03:08.529 --> 03:11.499
<i>What if our dreams are like
tiles in a grand mosaic</i>

03:11.531 --> 03:13.900
<i>we're all dreaming together?</i>

03:13.934 --> 03:17.103
<i>Now, what if a person,
that one right person,</i>

03:17.137 --> 03:21.741
<i>could wander out of their
dream and into yours?</i>

03:21.775 --> 03:23.244
<i>What if that person</i>

03:23.276 --> 03:25.212
<i>was you?</i>

04:06.085 --> 04:09.489
I say we treat ourselves to
a lovely dinner tonight.

04:13.994 --> 04:16.897
- How about Marcello's?
- Mmm.

04:16.928 --> 04:18.665
Marcello's.

04:20.500 --> 04:23.904
You'll call and get us a table?

04:43.489 --> 04:47.027
<i>- I can't do this anymore.
- I miss you.</i>

04:47.061 --> 04:48.863
<i>Too late.</i>

05:12.085 --> 05:14.155
This is Burton.

05:14.188 --> 05:16.324
<i>Did I call too late?</i>

05:16.357 --> 05:18.659
No, it's not too late.
It's never too late.

05:18.691 --> 05:20.328
That's why the firm

05:20.361 --> 05:22.163
has a security office.

05:22.196 --> 05:24.565
What's the name of the officer?

05:26.200 --> 05:27.801
I know him. He's a
friend of Danny Oldman.

05:27.835 --> 05:29.036
<i>What do you need me to do?</i>

05:29.068 --> 05:30.737
Be polite. Stay there.

05:30.770 --> 05:32.972
<i>All right, you got it.</i>

05:36.910 --> 05:40.481
<i>- How's the wife, Hank?
- Still spending my money.</i>

05:40.513 --> 05:42.549
<i>So I got a phone call</i>

05:42.583 --> 05:44.417
<i>from one of the boy
scouts from the firm.</i>

05:44.450 --> 05:46.320
Your Wall Street Master of the Universe

05:46.352 --> 05:47.821
got his drunk ass rolled

05:47.854 --> 05:49.155
looking for love in
all the wrong places.

05:49.188 --> 05:50.890
You don't know that.

05:50.924 --> 05:53.394
Maybe he was asking one of these
fine ladies where to get a cab.

05:53.426 --> 05:54.729
Ha ha! Come on, west of 10th Avenue

05:54.761 --> 05:56.162
with those legs?

05:56.196 --> 05:57.898
He's a married man and a senior partner.

05:57.931 --> 05:59.600
We found his wallet around the corner

05:59.633 --> 06:01.102
where the perps dropped it.

06:01.135 --> 06:03.270
He refused to give a statement
till we let him call

06:03.302 --> 06:05.072
"in-house security."

06:06.472 --> 06:08.842
Any reason I can't take him home?

06:08.876 --> 06:10.710
- I'd like a statement.
- Why?

06:10.744 --> 06:12.011
You don't want to do the paperwork.

06:12.044 --> 06:13.381
He doesn't want to testify.

06:13.414 --> 06:14.782
I'm sure the good people of New York

06:14.814 --> 06:16.182
would rather have you out on the street.

06:16.215 --> 06:17.785
Come on. Help me out here.

06:17.818 --> 06:20.121
I'll get you something
on paper tomorrow.

06:20.153 --> 06:21.721
All right.

06:26.292 --> 06:27.961
Mr. Jones?

06:29.496 --> 06:31.431
Burton.

06:31.465 --> 06:33.534
I was...

06:33.566 --> 06:36.203
having drinks with a... a...

06:36.236 --> 06:37.605
friend at the Old Homestead.

06:37.638 --> 06:40.039
Thought I'd step outside for some air.

06:40.073 --> 06:42.476
I've taken care of the police.

06:42.508 --> 06:44.612
The car service should
be here any moment.

06:47.580 --> 06:49.650
It was drinks.

06:49.683 --> 06:53.120
These men came out of the
dark, you understand?

06:53.152 --> 06:56.991
I do, but the more you talk,
the less believable you sound.

06:57.023 --> 07:00.827
You did the right thing.
You called. I'm here.

07:00.861 --> 07:03.597
Let the officers know, they...

07:03.629 --> 07:05.131
were doing their job.

07:05.164 --> 07:08.835
I don't begrudge. They're good men.

07:08.869 --> 07:12.306
We're all good men.

07:12.338 --> 07:13.606
Till we're not.

07:13.640 --> 07:16.110
Then we're just how God made us.

08:19.873 --> 08:21.208
Sir?

08:21.241 --> 08:22.710
You can't park here.

08:22.742 --> 08:24.612
Oh, sorry.

08:26.179 --> 08:29.116
NYPD. You still can't park here.

08:44.565 --> 08:46.200
Ma.

08:49.302 --> 08:51.104
You look good today.

08:51.138 --> 08:55.008
Ma, this... is a great thing.

08:55.042 --> 08:57.043
Wonder of the world. I'm not kidding.

08:57.076 --> 08:59.078
All your problems are
about to disappear.

08:59.111 --> 09:00.446
It's nice, huh?

09:00.479 --> 09:02.416
I'm gonna fill it with hot water,

09:02.449 --> 09:03.784
and you're gonna soak your feet.

09:03.816 --> 09:06.287
What do you think about that?

09:08.989 --> 09:11.392
You're welcome.

09:11.425 --> 09:13.160
I'll be right back.

09:15.162 --> 09:16.596
I was at the...

09:16.629 --> 09:18.197
dentist's office last week,

09:18.230 --> 09:20.633
and I read this article
about foot baths.

09:20.667 --> 09:22.069
It seems we don't treat our feet right.

09:22.101 --> 09:23.903
Lots of nerve endings there,

09:23.936 --> 09:27.073
which I suppose is why
they torture people

09:27.106 --> 09:29.776
by whacking the bottoms of their feet.

09:29.810 --> 09:32.046
Okay. Well, you know,
it got me to thinking

09:32.079 --> 09:34.080
a little foot relaxation
would be good for you.

09:34.114 --> 09:36.483
This Sri Lankan guy on Broadway

09:36.516 --> 09:38.319
gave me a sweet deal.

09:38.351 --> 09:40.720
Okay, you ready?

09:40.753 --> 09:44.358
All right. I'm just gonna
take off your shoes.

09:55.534 --> 09:58.137
Are you ready?

09:58.171 --> 09:59.440
Here we go.

10:04.378 --> 10:06.946
Ma?

10:19.526 --> 10:21.261
Ma?

10:45.185 --> 10:46.987
<i>- Tess?
- Yeah.</i>

10:47.019 --> 10:49.956
<i>That's a nice name. I'm Dr. Song.</i>

10:49.989 --> 10:53.793
What did you want to talk to me about?

10:53.826 --> 10:55.962
I want you to examine me.

10:55.995 --> 10:57.730
For what?

10:57.763 --> 11:00.200
I want you to tell me if
I've ever had a baby.

11:00.233 --> 11:02.136
A baby?

11:02.168 --> 11:04.871
- Yep.
- Um, Tess,

11:04.904 --> 11:06.874
according to your computer records,

11:06.907 --> 11:09.243
you've already asked Dr.
Obie and Dr. Rosenthal

11:09.276 --> 11:12.646
up at Mount Sinai to examine you.

11:12.678 --> 11:14.280
So?

11:15.849 --> 11:18.018
I think you should see a
mental health professional.

11:18.051 --> 11:20.554
I don't need a mental
health professional.

11:20.586 --> 11:23.023
I just want to know if I've had a baby.

11:23.056 --> 11:24.892
Well, Tess, if you'd had a baby,

11:24.925 --> 11:26.393
your cervix would show it.

11:26.426 --> 11:28.061
Not if it was a C-section.

11:28.095 --> 11:31.665
- There'd be a scar.
- Scars can be removed.

11:31.697 --> 11:35.568
Tess, there's no way you
could've had a baby

11:35.601 --> 11:37.270
and not know it.

11:47.781 --> 11:49.750
Mr. McCarthy's still talking about

11:49.782 --> 11:51.585
pending mergers in crowded restaurants,

11:51.618 --> 11:54.754
albeit not in a way that
exposes the firm to liability.

11:54.787 --> 11:56.255
I'll take him aside.

11:56.288 --> 11:59.192
Also, we back-traced
your Hong Kong client.

11:59.225 --> 12:01.360
Financially they're clean,
but if you peel the onion,

12:01.393 --> 12:04.630
30% of their revenue comes
from factories in Cambodia

12:04.663 --> 12:06.532
that employ slave labor.

12:06.566 --> 12:08.134
If you care.

12:08.167 --> 12:10.269
It's always better for
the firm if I know.

12:10.302 --> 12:12.705
What's the official Security
& Compliance report on Jones

12:12.739 --> 12:14.541
and his nocturnal adventure?

12:14.574 --> 12:16.643
Police have it down as
your basic mugging,

12:16.676 --> 12:18.311
even with the time and location.

12:18.345 --> 12:20.281
There's nothing to it
we weren't aware of.

12:23.182 --> 12:24.784
Tell him.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.289
Our compliance software flagged

12:29.321 --> 12:31.325
a series of suspect trades.

12:31.358 --> 12:34.261
No smoking gun, but they
reek of market manipulation.

12:34.293 --> 12:36.263
One constant is, the trades all carry

12:36.296 --> 12:39.800
a masked sub label... "Topeka."

12:39.832 --> 12:42.802
You think Jones is insider trading?

12:42.835 --> 12:44.671
I think Mr. Jones's desk makes this firm

12:44.704 --> 12:47.941
$80 million a quarter... every quarter.

12:47.974 --> 12:49.643
If the answer's yes, just say yes.

12:49.676 --> 12:51.311
The answer is, I have no idea.

12:51.344 --> 12:53.180
But last night, that
napkin was in his wallet,

12:53.213 --> 12:57.117
and if our software can pick up
these trades, so can the SEC.

12:57.149 --> 12:59.852
He wants your permission
to rattle cages, Nicholas.

12:59.885 --> 13:01.420
Of course. Go ahead.

13:01.454 --> 13:03.457
As long as you bring me the
truth, how can I complain?

13:03.489 --> 13:04.991
I can think of a couple of ways.

13:05.024 --> 13:06.859
Just make sure you keep it off email.

13:06.893 --> 13:09.028
Understood.

13:12.798 --> 13:15.101
Why Topeka?

13:15.134 --> 13:17.203
It's the capital of Kansas?

13:24.643 --> 13:28.782
So... how far in the loop
does he want to be kept?

13:28.815 --> 13:31.218
Somewhere between safely
in and safely out.

13:31.250 --> 13:33.352
Free of the blast zone.

13:33.385 --> 13:36.489
Do our job, but only if
we have no other choice?

13:36.523 --> 13:38.658
We're fleas steering a dog.

13:38.691 --> 13:41.828
Fleas tasked with keeping the
dog out of the kill shelter.

13:41.861 --> 13:43.501
If you want, I have a
stepdaughter at home

13:43.529 --> 13:45.531
who will treat you with
scorn and resentment

13:45.565 --> 13:46.967
and not pay you a dime.

13:46.999 --> 13:49.503
- I'll take a pass.
- You always do.

13:49.536 --> 13:52.005
No, I see what's coming, and I duck.

13:52.037 --> 13:54.174
- It's different.
- Not really.

13:59.412 --> 14:00.647
Hi.

14:08.388 --> 14:11.057
Let me call you back. Thank you.

14:11.090 --> 14:12.558
Did you tell him?

14:12.591 --> 14:14.193
Could you possibly be more obvious?

14:14.226 --> 14:15.328
I need to know. Did you say anything

14:15.361 --> 14:17.029
to Hull about me?

14:17.062 --> 14:19.866
Your personal life's not
a threat to the firm.

14:19.899 --> 14:22.501
Oh, Jesus. Thank you.

14:22.534 --> 14:24.871
The next time you shag the
wife of a senior partner,

14:24.904 --> 14:27.374
tell her not to sext you
on your company cell.

14:27.407 --> 14:29.075
Yeah, it was a mistake.

14:29.109 --> 14:31.912
I swear. I owe you.

14:31.945 --> 14:34.448
- So buy me a suit.
- Yeah?

14:34.480 --> 14:36.115
Uh, what, 42 regular?

14:36.148 --> 14:37.717
Go away.

14:37.750 --> 14:39.018
So you don't...

14:39.051 --> 14:40.988
You were kidding about the suit?

14:57.470 --> 14:59.205
Shit, man. Look who's here.

14:59.239 --> 15:01.074
Special Intelligence Unit.

15:01.106 --> 15:02.375
Vic must be a terrorist.

15:02.408 --> 15:03.744
She look like a terrorist to you?

15:03.777 --> 15:05.479
She looks like my grandma.

15:05.512 --> 15:08.282
Inside every terrorist
is somebody's grandma.

15:08.315 --> 15:10.984
Either way, consulate asked
SIU to stick its nose in.

15:11.017 --> 15:12.319
So what do you guys got so far?

15:12.351 --> 15:14.153
Lady came in, no appointment.

15:14.186 --> 15:16.222
Said she had business with
the ambassador, keeled over.

15:16.255 --> 15:18.725
- And did she? Have business?
- No.

15:18.758 --> 15:20.694
No ID either.

15:22.861 --> 15:24.563
Preliminary thoughts on cause?

15:24.596 --> 15:26.899
Heart attack, maybe? Allergic reaction?

15:26.932 --> 15:28.968
Wool, dust mites...
Happens all the time.

15:29.002 --> 15:30.804
The woman cared enough to
wear a medic-alert bracelet

15:30.836 --> 15:33.639
but didn't put down
her deadly allergies?

15:33.672 --> 15:35.075
I say we wait for toxicology.

15:35.108 --> 15:36.777
Jesus.

15:41.715 --> 15:43.517
Look, Tak, Marcos and I are still

15:43.550 --> 15:45.018
working the double homicide
from the other night.

15:45.051 --> 15:46.485
You want to take Jane Doe off our hands?

15:46.518 --> 15:48.120
God bless.

15:48.153 --> 15:50.090
You can turn it into a
whole big production.

15:50.123 --> 15:52.825
I got... I don't know if
it's a production yet.

15:52.859 --> 15:54.662
Neither do you.

15:56.495 --> 15:58.831
Y-you guys skip; let me
just see your notes first.

15:58.864 --> 16:01.634
50 bucks it's an allergic reaction.

16:01.667 --> 16:03.102
Peace be with you.

16:03.135 --> 16:06.072
- Also with you.
- Let us pray.

17:11.637 --> 17:14.374
<i>Tess, if there's something
nascent in the air,</i>

17:14.406 --> 17:16.009
<i>you'll be the one to find it.</i>

17:16.041 --> 17:18.911
<i>You're the best spotter out there.</i>

17:18.944 --> 17:23.250
So what defining new look
will every American consumer

17:23.281 --> 17:24.784
between 13 and 35

17:24.818 --> 17:27.554
be dying to buy at the mall next summer?

18:13.099 --> 18:14.667
Perfect.

18:23.775 --> 18:26.645
I expected you to pay a
call on me this morning.

18:26.678 --> 18:28.648
No.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.450
So the police statement...
they have what they need?

18:31.484 --> 18:32.852
Taken care of.

18:32.886 --> 18:34.687
Good. Thanks.

18:34.721 --> 18:35.955
I want to thank you.

18:35.988 --> 18:38.624
Last night, I was less than my best.

18:38.657 --> 18:41.994
It's not necessary.

18:42.028 --> 18:45.031
I did have one thing, though.

18:45.063 --> 18:46.867
Who were you having
drinks with last night

18:46.899 --> 18:48.502
at the Old Homestead?

18:48.534 --> 18:50.870
A friend. From Wharton.

18:50.904 --> 18:54.340
You charged it to the firm Amex.

18:54.373 --> 18:56.842
Did I? That was a mistake.

18:56.876 --> 18:58.945
So who was it?

18:58.977 --> 19:00.513
A friend.

19:00.546 --> 19:02.348
I've been asked to compile
a list of all contacts

19:02.381 --> 19:06.152
you've had with outside
trading entities.

19:06.186 --> 19:07.654
By who?

19:07.686 --> 19:09.555
People who want to know.

19:09.589 --> 19:11.992
It's my job to protect the firm.

19:12.024 --> 19:14.460
You want to dry your hands?

19:16.596 --> 19:17.830
I'll get a list.

19:17.863 --> 19:20.199
Including your friend from Wharton.

19:31.377 --> 19:33.312
Hey, got a line on your vic.

19:33.346 --> 19:35.582
According to the ID number
on the medic-alert bracelet,

19:35.615 --> 19:37.551
lady's name is Ann-Marie Bowen.

19:37.583 --> 19:38.984
No phone number on file,

19:39.017 --> 19:42.388
but there is an address
out in Long Island.

19:42.421 --> 19:44.690
And what about next of kin?
Notify in case of emergency?

19:44.724 --> 19:46.893
Just an address.

19:46.926 --> 19:48.895
All right, I'll head out there.

19:48.927 --> 19:50.731
See about notification.

21:15.682 --> 21:17.317
Ma'am, you need to call 911.

21:17.350 --> 21:19.019
Send the police to this location.

21:19.051 --> 21:21.120
- What's going on?
- Just call!

22:21.113 --> 22:23.982
Congratulations.

22:24.015 --> 22:25.752
In 12 months, half of the United States

22:25.784 --> 22:29.221
will be wearing green and black
sportswear, thanks to you.

22:31.123 --> 22:34.493
- I could be wrong, you know.
- I doubt it.

22:34.526 --> 22:37.529
Have you given any thought
to your next project?

22:37.562 --> 22:40.499
- What next project?
- Exactly.

22:40.532 --> 22:42.769
Bill Boerg really wants
to meet with you.

22:42.801 --> 22:44.503
- I don't do meetings.
- That's ridiculous.

22:44.536 --> 22:46.038
Of course you do meetings,

22:46.071 --> 22:49.007
especially with men worth
billions of dollars.

22:49.041 --> 22:52.678
- Not Bill Boerg.
- What is wrong with Bill Boerg?

22:52.712 --> 22:54.013
He's from Iceland.

22:54.045 --> 22:55.914
We all have to grow up somewhere.

22:55.947 --> 22:58.784
I'm from Lowell, Massachusetts.
You don't hold that against me.

22:58.818 --> 23:00.453
Hello, Bill.

23:00.485 --> 23:02.554
What a coincidence.

23:02.588 --> 23:04.724
- Gotcha.
- You bushwhacked me.

23:04.756 --> 23:06.258
I did nothing of the sort.

23:06.292 --> 23:08.461
Bill has as much right
to eat here as we do.

23:08.494 --> 23:10.062
- Five minutes of your time.
- Damn it, Miranda.

23:10.096 --> 23:11.731
I told you no meetings.

23:11.763 --> 23:13.933
Shoot me for trying to get you work.

23:13.965 --> 23:16.402
Good idea. You're fired.

23:16.436 --> 23:19.406
- She serious?
- Don't worry.

23:19.438 --> 23:22.242
It's the fifth time she's
fired me this week.

23:25.477 --> 23:27.212
Nice work. Very smooth.

23:27.245 --> 23:28.915
I'm not some widget you drag around

23:28.947 --> 23:30.483
- from client to client.
- I'm your agent.

23:30.515 --> 23:33.585
I try to get you jobs,
jobs that feed us both.

23:33.619 --> 23:35.321
Hey, hey.

23:35.353 --> 23:37.090
What's wrong?

23:37.122 --> 23:39.225
- Nothing.
- You haven't called in weeks.

23:39.257 --> 23:42.227
What happened to your smile?
I'm worried about you.

23:42.261 --> 23:45.154
- Don't be.
- Are you getting enough sleep?

23:45.179 --> 23:46.592
Are you premenstrual?

23:46.617 --> 23:47.901
Did you let some creepy
guy into your life

23:47.934 --> 23:49.903
against your better judgment?

23:49.936 --> 23:53.106
- I'm okay. Honest.
- I love you.

23:53.138 --> 23:56.376
Love you too. But no Bill Boerg.

24:13.725 --> 24:17.095
I thought we weren't seeing each other.

24:17.128 --> 24:20.699
We're not. I'm not even here.

24:22.301 --> 24:25.839
Yet... here you are.

24:27.873 --> 24:29.942
A moth to a flame.

24:31.543 --> 24:34.046
How have you been?

24:34.080 --> 24:36.015
Really awful.

24:37.683 --> 24:39.486
Want to come to my office?

24:45.390 --> 24:47.726
I don't do well under fluorescence.

24:53.432 --> 24:56.169
I had a dream about you last night.

24:59.038 --> 25:01.841
This was a mistake.

25:01.873 --> 25:04.042
Nothing has changed,

25:04.076 --> 25:05.578
at least for me.

25:05.610 --> 25:09.215
I just thought...

25:10.515 --> 25:12.150
I don't know what I thought.

25:12.184 --> 25:13.853
I'm sorry.

25:13.886 --> 25:15.689
Have dinner with me.

25:18.189 --> 25:19.525
What's the point?

25:21.694 --> 25:23.730
It's really good to see you.

25:31.236 --> 25:33.939
Tonight. 8:00.

25:33.973 --> 25:35.207
Where?

25:35.241 --> 25:37.577
You know where.

25:37.609 --> 25:39.678
Marcello's.

25:48.454 --> 25:50.757
Staties are gonna take the lead on this.

25:50.790 --> 25:54.193
Looks like a group suicide.
Some kind of poison.

25:54.225 --> 25:56.462
Bodies are outside the
five boroughs, so...

25:56.494 --> 25:59.032
- Makes sense.
- You've got a way, Tak.

25:59.064 --> 26:00.432
Like a bad penny.

26:00.465 --> 26:02.869
- Never on purpose, Captain.
- Stick around.

26:02.901 --> 26:04.870
Help out best you can.

26:04.904 --> 26:08.975
Not that there's much to help with.

26:09.007 --> 26:10.309
What about Ann-Marie Bowen?

26:10.342 --> 26:11.777
Vic at the consulate?

26:11.811 --> 26:13.713
M.E. said she died of
anaphylactic shock.

26:13.745 --> 26:15.047
Bee sting.

26:15.080 --> 26:16.815
That's one hell of a coincidence.

26:16.849 --> 26:19.452
So is the existence of life on Earth.

26:19.484 --> 26:22.121
By the way, Marcos says
you owe him 50 bucks.

27:09.901 --> 27:11.170
Hi.

27:14.305 --> 27:16.042
You almost didn't come.

27:18.176 --> 27:19.712
I couldn't catch a cab.

27:19.744 --> 27:22.948
No, you stalled.

27:22.982 --> 27:25.885
In your hotel room or your new place

27:25.917 --> 27:28.286
or wherever you stay when
you're in New York these days.

27:28.320 --> 27:31.057
It's The Pierre. It's always The Pierre.

27:31.090 --> 27:34.127
You... paced.

27:34.159 --> 27:35.994
You chewed your thumb.

27:36.028 --> 27:40.566
You debated which dress
and does black with a hem

27:40.599 --> 27:44.236
just above the knee
send the right signal?

27:44.270 --> 27:47.240
And what about you?

27:47.273 --> 27:49.475
I can just see you.

27:49.507 --> 27:52.811
You cleaned off your desk just so.

27:52.844 --> 27:55.814
Everything at a 90-degree angle.

27:55.848 --> 27:58.251
And then you looked at
your watch and realized

27:58.283 --> 28:01.387
that you shouldn't leave
for another ten minutes

28:01.419 --> 28:04.056
or you'd get here way too early.

28:04.090 --> 28:08.026
So you passed the time by
putting on a clean shirt

28:08.060 --> 28:13.331
from the box of clean shirts you
keep in your bottom drawer.

28:13.365 --> 28:16.736
And somewhere in there,

28:16.769 --> 28:19.372
somewhere between the fourth button

28:19.405 --> 28:22.241
and the knot of your tie,

28:22.273 --> 28:24.843
you thought about not showing up at all.

28:27.279 --> 28:29.849
I never did any of those things.

28:29.881 --> 28:32.918
Yes, you did,

28:32.952 --> 28:37.223
because you were afraid
I might not come,

28:37.255 --> 28:41.359
and you didn't want to be
left sitting all alone...

28:41.392 --> 28:44.696
because then you'd be out of control.

28:44.730 --> 28:48.468
And you need control

28:48.501 --> 28:50.603
like a child needs his
mother to tell him

28:50.636 --> 28:53.440
that planes aren't going
to fall out of the sky.

28:56.742 --> 28:58.311
I love you.

29:01.246 --> 29:03.349
Say it again, and I'm walking out.

29:07.186 --> 29:10.455
I love you.

29:33.611 --> 29:36.181
It's still raining.

29:54.300 --> 29:56.168
<i>Look.</i>

30:05.077 --> 30:06.846
Weren't we just here?

30:06.878 --> 30:08.680
We always come here.

31:23.789 --> 31:26.926
You're okay. Say you're okay.

31:26.958 --> 31:29.594
Say it. You're okay.

31:29.628 --> 31:31.397
Say it! No.

31:31.429 --> 31:33.733
No! No!

31:33.765 --> 31:36.268
Burton! No! No!

31:36.301 --> 31:39.472
Help me!

31:39.504 --> 31:42.041
Burton! Help me!

31:42.073 --> 31:43.775
Help!

32:24.817 --> 32:26.652
<i>We're sorry.</i>

32:26.685 --> 32:28.921
<i>Your call cannot be completed as dialed.</i>

32:28.954 --> 32:31.557
<i>Please check the number
and dial again or...</i>

32:42.533 --> 32:45.204
Excuse me. Last night...

32:45.236 --> 32:47.473
you didn't see a woman
leaving the building?

32:47.505 --> 32:50.176
Brown hair, black dress?

32:50.208 --> 32:52.878
- Sorry.
- Right.

33:45.296 --> 33:46.898
My feeling, for what it's worth?

33:46.932 --> 33:49.035
The world revolves around meetings.

33:49.068 --> 33:52.571
Without meetings, we wouldn't
get to know each other,

33:52.603 --> 33:55.106
exchange fresh ideas,
have conversations.

33:55.139 --> 33:57.275
Don't you think it's important
to have conversations?

33:57.309 --> 33:59.045
- What do you want?
- I have a project.

33:59.078 --> 34:00.679
I need your assistance.

34:00.712 --> 34:03.715
- No, thanks.
- Why not?

34:03.748 --> 34:05.350
I don't like being held hostage.

34:05.384 --> 34:07.053
Who's holding you hostage?

34:09.788 --> 34:12.458
I'm asking to borrow
you for five minutes

34:12.491 --> 34:16.628
for which I will pay you $50,000.

34:16.661 --> 34:20.130
Tess, I am interested in
a new way of thinking

34:20.165 --> 34:21.600
that could lead to a revolution

34:21.632 --> 34:24.569
in our understanding
of human existence...

34:24.603 --> 34:26.938
the idea that we are
all connected in ways

34:26.971 --> 34:30.074
that we can't even understand yet.

34:30.109 --> 34:32.911
Too macro? Okay.

34:32.944 --> 34:36.947
You, Tess, can go out into the world

34:36.982 --> 34:39.451
and pick out the one kid
wearing the one outfit

34:39.485 --> 34:42.088
that will be embraced by
consumers around the world.

34:42.121 --> 34:44.156
If you can tap into the
unconscious desires,

34:44.188 --> 34:47.393
the dreams, of 50 million people,

34:47.426 --> 34:49.094
then isn't it a fair possibility

34:49.127 --> 34:52.563
that you could tap into
the dreams of just one?

34:52.598 --> 34:54.667
- No.
- You're that sure.

34:54.699 --> 34:57.636
I've been asked this before.
I don't read minds.

34:57.668 --> 35:00.973
I can't tell you what your
grandpa wants for Christmas.

35:01.005 --> 35:03.908
I spot trends. Mass trends.

35:03.942 --> 35:06.846
Ripples in the Jungian
collective unconscious.

35:06.878 --> 35:08.647
Nothing that grandiose.

35:08.679 --> 35:11.951
I'm not asking you to play
gypsy fortune teller.

35:11.984 --> 35:14.119
Even if you could tell the future,

35:14.152 --> 35:17.022
I wouldn't want to spoil the surprise.

35:17.054 --> 35:20.125
All I want is for you
to spend the afternoon

35:20.159 --> 35:23.996
in a hotel suite with a friend of mine.

35:24.029 --> 35:25.797
- Doing what?
- Nothing big.

35:25.831 --> 35:27.933
I just want you to sleep with him.

35:27.965 --> 35:29.835
Not like that.

35:29.868 --> 35:31.871
It's dreams.

35:33.337 --> 35:34.806
Do you ever get the feeling

35:34.839 --> 35:37.974
your dreams are trying
to tell you something?

35:45.083 --> 35:47.353
Help me...

35:47.386 --> 35:49.489
and I will help you find your son.

35:51.522 --> 35:54.025
I don't have a son.

35:57.529 --> 35:59.398
You want to bet?

38:04.221 --> 38:05.990
Hi.

38:06.023 --> 38:08.460
I'm looking for a guest.

38:08.493 --> 38:09.695
I'm sorry.

38:09.728 --> 38:11.463
She's not coming up in the system.

38:11.496 --> 38:14.333
Maybe she... maybe she checked out, hmm?

38:14.366 --> 38:17.201
Well, if she had, she'd
still be in the system.

38:17.235 --> 38:19.805
Are you sure she wasn't staying
at The Sherry or The Carlyle?

38:19.837 --> 38:21.439
No, no, she always stays here.

38:21.473 --> 38:23.875
At The Pierre.

38:23.909 --> 38:25.444
How far back do your records go?

38:25.476 --> 38:27.245
Eight, nine years.

38:30.982 --> 38:32.685
Excuse me.

38:52.938 --> 38:55.074
Staties called over to say thanks.

38:55.107 --> 38:58.009
Mostly stood around. Tried
not to get in the way.

38:58.043 --> 38:59.411
Don't knock it.

38:59.444 --> 39:02.348
That is a rare and valuable
skill in the police.

39:14.592 --> 39:17.596
Who's that?

39:17.628 --> 39:19.764
Ann-Marie Bowen.

39:29.708 --> 39:32.244
Thank you.

39:32.277 --> 39:35.581
You look like you got
run over in your sleep.

39:35.614 --> 39:37.349
We all have restless nights.

39:37.382 --> 39:39.885
I used to have the most
horrible insomnia.

39:39.918 --> 39:41.353
I'd leave the house, have a drink

39:41.386 --> 39:43.922
at this Italian place,
check into a hotel.

39:43.955 --> 39:47.592
I could always sleep in a hotel.
My favorite was The Pierre.

39:49.895 --> 39:51.730
Maybe I should try that.

39:51.763 --> 39:54.065
You should stop by Marcello's
while you're at it.

39:54.098 --> 39:56.234
That was the restaurant.

39:56.268 --> 39:57.703
Have these sent out by messenger.

39:57.735 --> 40:00.406
Thanks.

40:00.438 --> 40:04.777
Oh, if you still want that list
of contacts, come by my office.

40:04.810 --> 40:07.012
I'll have it by noon. I didn't forget.

40:09.681 --> 40:11.717
You'll get your revised
documents by the 23rd.

40:11.750 --> 40:12.752
Thank you.

40:15.152 --> 40:17.922
How hard can I push on Jones?

40:17.956 --> 40:20.025
Not very.

40:21.259 --> 40:24.563
Right.

40:24.596 --> 40:26.931
I'm gonna push on him.

40:26.964 --> 40:29.534
You're cute when you're indignant.

40:31.703 --> 40:34.273
Is he stonewalling you?

40:34.306 --> 40:36.574
- No.
- Then what do you have?

40:36.607 --> 40:39.076
Nothing. Not nothing.

40:39.110 --> 40:41.113
The man runs a profitable desk.

40:41.145 --> 40:42.947
When have you known me to chase a ghost?

40:42.980 --> 40:44.515
Never.

40:44.549 --> 40:46.985
You have an unerring
nose for malfeasance.

40:48.286 --> 40:50.155
Jones is hooked into something.

40:50.188 --> 40:52.157
Bring me the ocular proof.

41:13.744 --> 41:16.315
What now?

41:16.348 --> 41:18.516
Now you lie down and go to sleep,

41:18.549 --> 41:20.451
and when you wake up,

41:20.485 --> 41:22.822
you tell me everything that
happened in your dreams.

41:28.393 --> 41:30.763
What if I don't dream?

41:33.197 --> 41:35.333
When have you not dreamed?

41:53.118 --> 41:57.623
It's for scientific observation
so we can track your REM cycles.

42:06.764 --> 42:09.067
Take a good look at him.

42:13.705 --> 42:16.708
See if you can think about...

42:16.741 --> 42:18.443
I don't know.

42:18.476 --> 42:20.779
See if you can think about
what he might be dreaming.

42:26.384 --> 42:27.987
What do you know about my son?

42:31.489 --> 42:32.958
When you wake up.

42:45.502 --> 42:47.238
If you're having trouble dropping off,

42:47.272 --> 42:49.574
just let me know, and I
can arrange an Ambien

42:49.607 --> 42:52.777
or a cocktail.

42:52.810 --> 42:54.712
Joint.

42:54.746 --> 42:57.282
Whatever you need.

43:17.335 --> 43:19.638
Shh. Do you hear that?

44:00.744 --> 44:02.413
Next stop, Wichita.

44:24.868 --> 44:27.005
So I guess you found me.

44:28.339 --> 44:29.975
I guess.

44:46.123 --> 44:47.525
Don't tell Bill.

44:49.293 --> 44:51.730
- Tell him what?
- Exactly.

44:59.069 --> 45:02.039
Tell him...

45:02.072 --> 45:04.109
you know...

45:04.141 --> 45:05.710
Tell him I was playing piano.

45:05.743 --> 45:08.512
He loves when I play piano.

45:08.545 --> 45:10.248
Cole Porter.

45:12.884 --> 45:14.619
What's your name?

45:14.652 --> 45:17.222
I don't have to tell you.

45:19.491 --> 45:21.493
You're the visitor.

45:26.931 --> 45:28.734
Can I help?

45:31.969 --> 45:34.572
Well, tunnel's only big enough for one.

46:09.373 --> 46:11.375
Tell me about your dreams.

46:15.547 --> 46:17.349
Your man was there.

46:17.382 --> 46:19.251
Andy?

46:19.284 --> 46:20.786
The man in the other bed.

46:20.819 --> 46:22.721
Andy. What was he doing?

46:24.956 --> 46:26.858
He was playing piano.

46:26.891 --> 46:29.860
What was he playing?

46:29.893 --> 46:33.130
A Cole Porter song.

46:33.163 --> 46:34.366
"Anything Goes."

46:34.398 --> 46:35.667
Yes!

46:37.701 --> 46:39.670
I didn't know show tunes
were so exciting.

46:39.703 --> 46:42.273
You have no idea.

46:42.306 --> 46:45.310
This... imagine absolute connectivity.

46:45.342 --> 46:48.045
No wires. No Wi-Fi. No servers.
No routers.

46:48.078 --> 46:50.281
Just pure communication,

46:50.315 --> 46:54.351
cerebral cortex to cerebral cortex.

46:54.384 --> 46:58.055
I just want to know about my son.

46:58.089 --> 47:01.625
Where is he?

47:01.659 --> 47:05.630
What's his name?

47:05.663 --> 47:08.366
And why do I only know
about him in my dreams?

47:11.569 --> 47:13.038
- Am I crazy?
- You're not crazy.

47:13.071 --> 47:16.141
You're just... sensitive.

47:16.174 --> 47:17.842
Here.

47:21.511 --> 47:24.915
Go to St. Joseph's Hospital in Queens.

47:24.949 --> 47:27.052
Ask them why their accounting software

47:27.085 --> 47:29.521
lists you with an
unresolved $10 chargeback

47:29.554 --> 47:34.392
when there is no record of you
having ever been a patient.

47:34.424 --> 47:39.897
And the billing code is for an epidural.

47:39.931 --> 47:42.032
I have resources that
could follow up on that,

47:42.065 --> 47:44.034
but nothing in this world is free.

47:51.576 --> 47:53.778
- What else do you know?
- Nothing.

47:53.810 --> 47:57.014
But you help me with my adventure,

47:57.047 --> 47:59.717
and maybe we can both
get everything we want.

48:43.261 --> 48:44.963
Oh, uh, I'm sorry, ma'am.

48:44.996 --> 48:46.464
Is this your house?

48:46.496 --> 48:48.399
30 years.

48:48.433 --> 48:51.235
And do you have help of any kind?

48:51.268 --> 48:52.971
No.

48:53.003 --> 48:55.674
Is this more about that
hazarai across the street?

48:57.308 --> 48:59.277
Do you recognize this woman?

49:00.511 --> 49:02.246
Never seen her in my life,

49:02.279 --> 49:05.984
but if she's some big deal,
I can keep my eye out.

49:06.016 --> 49:08.319
Sure, that'd be great. Thanks.

49:08.353 --> 49:11.156
You look like the sky's about to fall.

49:12.489 --> 49:13.824
The sky's fine right where it is.

49:13.857 --> 49:15.359
Thank you, ma'am.

50:36.107 --> 50:37.641
Yeah?

50:41.545 --> 50:43.380
Yeah, okay.

52:52.710 --> 52:57.081
How'd you get past the doorman?

52:57.114 --> 52:58.650
Apparently your Christmas tips

52:58.683 --> 53:00.818
weren't all they should've been.

53:00.851 --> 53:03.087
My wife is such a cheap bitch.

53:04.755 --> 53:06.691
Where is she?

53:06.723 --> 53:10.494
She took 'Cilla up to the...
house in Stockbridge.

53:10.527 --> 53:13.363
I was supposed to join them, but...

53:13.397 --> 53:16.067
I guess I missed my train.

53:19.369 --> 53:21.605
What did Woody say to you?

53:23.975 --> 53:25.944
Nothing.

53:25.976 --> 53:28.612
Doesn't matter. Woody doesn't matter.

53:28.645 --> 53:31.848
It's Topeka.

53:31.882 --> 53:34.619
It's always Topeka.

53:34.652 --> 53:38.121
So much bigger than we should ever know.

53:38.154 --> 53:39.590
Bigger how?

53:41.592 --> 53:43.695
Right...

53:43.728 --> 53:45.697
You still think it's about the money.

53:45.730 --> 53:49.934
The price of winter wheat.

53:49.967 --> 53:52.237
It's everything.

53:52.270 --> 53:53.804
You. Me. Woody.

53:53.837 --> 53:55.439
Your girl.

53:55.473 --> 53:56.708
What girl?

53:56.741 --> 53:58.141
The color of my mother's purse

53:58.174 --> 53:59.977
when I threw it off
the Serpentine Bridge

54:00.011 --> 54:02.313
when she wouldn't let
me ride the carousel.

54:02.346 --> 54:05.650
What girl? Go back to the girl.

54:05.683 --> 54:07.552
There's Chinese in the refrigerator

54:07.585 --> 54:11.389
if you get hungry
waiting for the police.

54:31.676 --> 54:36.147
<i>When I began, I was a man of science.</i>

54:36.179 --> 54:38.315
<i>I believed there was no truth</i>

54:38.348 --> 54:40.684
<i>beyond what we can see</i>

54:40.717 --> 54:44.489
<i>and test and prove.</i>

54:44.522 --> 54:46.190
<i>I don't believe that anymore.</i>

54:50.293 --> 54:53.598
<i>Now most nights, I wake
up in a cold sweat,</i>

54:53.630 --> 54:55.333
<i>convinced some deeper truth</i>

54:55.366 --> 54:58.201
<i>has revealed itself in my dream.</i>

54:58.235 --> 55:01.306
<i>If only I can hang on to
it before it fades away.</i>

55:09.145 --> 55:11.348
<i>There's a war going on,</i>

55:11.382 --> 55:13.685
<i>a war for control of our dreams,</i>

55:13.717 --> 55:17.321
<i>and the outcome just
may hinge on the fate</i>

55:17.355 --> 55:19.724
<i>of a single person,</i>

55:19.757 --> 55:22.527
<i>a special and powerful person.</i>

55:26.163 --> 55:29.500
<i>Now you can believe me or not,</i>

55:29.532 --> 55:33.071
<i>but what if your dreams are
trying to tell you something?</i>

55:36.239 --> 55:38.542
<i>What if they're trying to tell you...</i>

55:38.576 --> 55:41.411
<i>your life's at stake?</i>
