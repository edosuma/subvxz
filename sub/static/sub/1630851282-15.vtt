There's gotta be
another ball in there.

20:45.724 --> 20:48.379
- Sir,
I am a professional counter.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.620
I do not make mistakes.

20:51.655 --> 20:53.689
- Where's that other ball?!

20:53.758 --> 20:55.137
- According to these entries,

20:55.206 --> 20:58.344
four people had
the winning number.

20:58.413 --> 21:00.103
- What?
How did this happen?!

21:00.172 --> 21:02.000
- Well, gosh, Tubby.

21:02.068 --> 21:04.793
If four people
guessed the right number,

21:04.862 --> 21:07.172
you have to give away
four hot tubs.

21:07.241 --> 21:09.034
- It almost seems like someone

21:09.103 --> 21:11.034
took out
one of the Ping-Pong balls.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.517
- That might have looked
something like this.

21:13.586 --> 21:15.586
- [gasps]

21:15.655 --> 21:17.586
- And then those same
somebodies must have put

21:17.655 --> 21:20.000
an entry in the box so that
they could win a hot tub.

21:20.068 --> 21:22.172
Until their friend
reminded them

21:22.241 --> 21:24.931
that they could also help some
other people win a hot tub,

21:25.000 --> 21:27.275
which is why this group
of orphans

21:27.344 --> 21:29.137
just won three hot tubs!

21:29.206 --> 21:31.206
all: Yay!

21:31.275 --> 21:32.862
- You cheated.

21:32.931 --> 21:35.931
And I hate cheaters
that aren't me.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.206
I'm not giving away
four hot tubs!

21:38.275 --> 21:39.655
- As the official counter,

21:39.724 --> 21:43.137
I must inform you,
yeah, you are too.

21:43.206 --> 21:46.034
[cheering]

21:46.103 --> 21:48.379
- Well, we got our revenge.
What should we do now?

21:48.448 --> 21:51.068
- We could walk out of the door
in slow motion.

21:51.137 --> 21:53.137
- Let's do it.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.241
- I feel just like
Sandra Bullock.
