WEBVTT

00:02.067 --> 00:03.329
I'm so excited!

00:04.069 --> 00:06.332
<i>My kids!</i> Playing
their first little league game!

00:06.376 --> 00:08.726
Wow, Mom, I never knew
you were such a baseball nut!

00:08.770 --> 00:10.119
Oh, big time!

00:10.162 --> 00:11.773
You know, your ol' mom
used to be quite

00:11.816 --> 00:14.123
the little leaguer herself
back in the day.

00:14.166 --> 00:16.386
There is no greater joy
on this earth

00:16.429 --> 00:19.084
than the crack of a bat
and the thrill of a win!

00:19.128 --> 00:21.696
- Well, except for children.
- Yay!

00:21.739 --> 00:24.525
What's most important
is that you two have fun!

00:24.568 --> 00:26.396
But also, winning.
Try to get a win in there.

00:26.439 --> 00:29.138
Tweet! Tweet!

00:29.181 --> 00:32.445
I forgot my whistle!
Everyone come over!

00:32.489 --> 00:35.187
- Bye, Mom!
- Good luck, kids!

00:35.231 --> 00:36.449
Baseball!

00:36.493 --> 00:38.147
All right team, listen up!

00:38.190 --> 00:41.280
When you woke up this morning,
you were individuals.

00:41.324 --> 00:46.024
But today, on this field,
you're all Big City Sue-Zers!

00:46.285 --> 00:47.983
Uh, what's a Sue-zer?

00:48.026 --> 00:51.290
Huh? Sue's Bruisers?
Was that not clear?

00:51.334 --> 00:52.988
[all] No. Not at all.

00:53.031 --> 00:56.252
Well, the print shop
said no refunds, so...

00:56.295 --> 00:57.819
"Sue-Zers" on three!

00:57.862 --> 01:00.430
- One, two, three!
- [all] Sue-zers!

01:00.473 --> 01:02.998
Booo! Booo!

01:03.041 --> 01:05.000
Ma, the game hasn't started yet.

01:05.043 --> 01:06.784
Oh, hey, Nancy.
We saved you a seat!

01:06.828 --> 01:09.221
Thank ya much!
The Remingtons!

01:09.265 --> 01:11.833
Whoa, Russell,
why the long face?

01:11.876 --> 01:14.270
Oh, he's just mad because
baseball isn't football.

01:14.313 --> 01:15.837
The ball's too small!

01:15.880 --> 01:17.926
It doesn't make sense!

01:17.969 --> 01:19.841
Well, today's about baseball,

01:19.884 --> 01:21.949
and nothing's gettin' in the way
of my kids winning...

01:21.973 --> 01:23.671
[honks and screeches]

01:23.714 --> 01:25.498
- Huh?
- Oh, no!

01:25.542 --> 01:26.761
It can't be!

01:27.370 --> 01:29.024
Hup, hup, hup, hup!

01:32.593 --> 01:34.899
[Sue] It's the elites!

01:34.943 --> 01:36.074
[all gasp]

01:36.118 --> 01:37.641
I thought they were just a myth!

01:37.685 --> 01:39.774
No! They're real!

01:39.817 --> 01:41.906
And they've never lost a game!

01:41.950 --> 01:43.647
[Community Dan]
Well, well, well!

01:43.691 --> 01:46.302
If it isn't my old nemesis,
Community Sue!

01:46.345 --> 01:48.913
Community Dan,
it's horrible to see you.

01:48.957 --> 01:51.350
I don't know, Remy.
They don't seem too bad.

01:51.394 --> 01:53.570
Hey, best of luck
out there, Sue...

01:53.614 --> 01:57.008
with your Big City Losers!
Ha ha!

01:57.052 --> 01:59.881
Hey, it's Sue-zers! Not lo...

01:59.924 --> 02:02.927
Oh, no. I practically
gift-wrapped it for him!

02:02.971 --> 02:05.451
What was I thinking?!

02:05.495 --> 02:07.497
- [cries]
- Yoof!

02:08.237 --> 02:10.152
Let's play ball!

02:10.195 --> 02:11.457
[cheering]

02:12.371 --> 02:14.547
Whoo! Go Sue-zers!

02:14.591 --> 02:15.766
You got this, kids!

02:16.332 --> 02:18.943
Mom's right! The Elites may
have an intimidating name,

02:18.987 --> 02:21.467
expensive equipment,
and proper training.

02:21.511 --> 02:23.861
But that's no match
for our team spirit!

02:23.905 --> 02:26.690
So, whaddya say we
play some ball?

02:26.734 --> 02:27.865
Yeah, yeah!

02:27.909 --> 02:29.301
The pitcher's my brother.

02:30.999 --> 02:32.174
[grunts]

02:32.435 --> 02:33.784
- [crack]
- Ah!

02:33.828 --> 02:35.786
I got it, I got it, I got it!

02:35.830 --> 02:37.048
I didn't got it.

02:37.092 --> 02:39.790
[Skyler] Eat that, losers!
[laughs]

02:39.834 --> 02:42.706
And that's a home run
for the Elites!

02:42.750 --> 02:44.403
- [crowd groans]
- Ooh, they're good.

02:44.447 --> 02:46.362
Green! Baseball talk!

02:47.450 --> 02:49.539
[Sue] <i>Use your special pitch!</i>

02:49.582 --> 02:50.932
- [Cricket] <i>Understood.
- [horks]</i>

02:52.281 --> 02:54.457
Aw, yeah. Show 'em
how it's done!

02:54.500 --> 02:55.980
[grunts]

02:56.024 --> 02:57.590
- [bat cracks]
- [yelps]

02:57.634 --> 02:58.809
I got it!

02:58.853 --> 03:00.898
[sreams]

03:01.986 --> 03:03.814
Oh, jeez!
You okay, kid?

03:03.858 --> 03:05.178
Thankfully it
missed my fingers...

03:05.207 --> 03:06.774
Psych! I don't actually care!

03:06.817 --> 03:08.776
Nice taunt out there, Chelsea!

03:08.819 --> 03:11.430
Way to lure 'em into
a false sense of security!

03:11.474 --> 03:13.215
They're good <i>and</i> they're mean?!

03:13.258 --> 03:15.826
Hey, Sue! Tell this guy
to take it down a notch!

03:15.870 --> 03:17.872
Taking it down a notch
goes against

03:17.915 --> 03:20.831
everything I stand for,
but okay!

03:20.875 --> 03:21.832
Hey, Dan!

03:21.876 --> 03:24.139
Let's try to be
good sports, huh?!

03:24.182 --> 03:26.881
Oh, my! Have we been
hurting your feelings?

03:26.924 --> 03:28.970
Oh, well, gee, I'm so sorry.

03:29.013 --> 03:31.233
Psych! Kids!
Circle of Shame!

03:31.276 --> 03:35.150
- [kids chanting] Loser! Loser!
- No! It's Sue-Zer! It's Sue-Zer!

03:35.193 --> 03:36.717
Oh, dear.

03:36.760 --> 03:39.023
The Sue-zers can
turn it around, right?

03:39.894 --> 03:42.070
Wow. If I weren't
an impartial umpire,

03:42.113 --> 03:44.289
I'd say this is embarrassing!

03:46.117 --> 03:47.684
Don't worry, guys.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.034
There's only nine more
innings of this.

03:50.078 --> 03:51.819
I'm just gonna stop recording.

03:51.862 --> 03:54.212
This game has barely begun
and it's a travesty!

03:54.256 --> 03:55.518
Ugh, I've had enough!

03:55.561 --> 03:57.085
- Nance?
- What are you doing?

03:57.128 --> 03:59.565
Taking things into my own hands.

03:59.957 --> 04:02.743
All right y'all, let's just
try and get mercy-ruled.

04:02.786 --> 04:04.788
Hey, friend,
lemme give it a try!

04:04.832 --> 04:05.963
Mom?!

04:06.224 --> 04:08.183
- What are you doing?
- "Mom"? Who's "Mom"?

04:08.226 --> 04:10.533
I'm the new kid on the team!

04:10.576 --> 04:13.928
- [groans]
- This just got real interesting.

04:13.971 --> 04:16.539
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Time out!

04:16.582 --> 04:19.847
This isn't allowed!
You're like fifty-five!

04:19.890 --> 04:21.022
- At least!
- No way, Mister!

04:21.065 --> 04:23.111
I'm eleven years old!

04:23.154 --> 04:24.677
I wanna see some ID!

04:24.721 --> 04:26.288
I don't have ID.

04:26.331 --> 04:27.811
<i>I'm eleven!</i>

04:27.855 --> 04:29.552
That checks out!
You're in!

04:29.595 --> 04:31.859
What?! Aw! Fine!

04:31.902 --> 04:33.140
It doesn't matter
how old you are!

04:33.164 --> 04:35.253
We"re still gonna wipe
the floor with you!

04:35.297 --> 04:36.864
Okay, Sue-zers, huddle up!

04:36.907 --> 04:39.083
Oh, Mama! Have you come
to take us home?

04:39.127 --> 04:41.216
Yup! To home plate!

04:41.259 --> 04:43.827
- Huhwuh?
- I'm gonna help y'all
win this game!

04:43.871 --> 04:45.196
- But isn't that cheating?
- [gasps]

04:45.220 --> 04:47.178
Aren't you
Cricket's girlfriend??

04:47.222 --> 04:48.614
- Mom!
- Right, right!

04:48.658 --> 04:50.312
It's not cheating, it's justice!

04:50.355 --> 04:51.835
Those jerks are too mean

04:51.879 --> 04:53.924
and don't deserve to feel
the joy of a win.

04:53.968 --> 04:55.752
- You do!
- [kids] Yeah!

04:55.796 --> 04:57.319
Wait, what about Community Sue?

04:57.362 --> 04:59.974
Those kids took
everything from me.

05:00.017 --> 05:01.627
Do what you must.

05:01.671 --> 05:03.847
Old Green, you're in.
Benny, you're out.

05:03.891 --> 05:05.240
This is buwwhonky!

05:05.283 --> 05:06.894
I'm the backbone of this team!

05:06.937 --> 05:07.895
I poured my blood, sweat
and tears into this sport!

05:07.938 --> 05:09.853
Ump! We're ready to play!

05:09.897 --> 05:12.073
Time in! Let's play ball!

05:13.901 --> 05:15.946
Let's see what you got, kid.

05:15.990 --> 05:17.252
Hope I still got it.

05:18.949 --> 05:20.342
[grunts]

05:20.385 --> 05:21.691
[yells]

05:22.170 --> 05:23.780
Stee-rike!

05:23.824 --> 05:26.000
- [all] Wow! Whoa!
- What?!

05:26.957 --> 05:28.916
Oh, yeah. Still got it.

05:30.656 --> 05:32.571
- [grunts]
- Whoa!

05:33.703 --> 05:35.183
- Huh?
- [grunts]

05:35.966 --> 05:36.967
Ah, whoop!

05:39.578 --> 05:40.666
[cheering]

05:40.710 --> 05:42.146
- [groans]
- [grunts]

05:42.190 --> 05:44.540
Whoa!

05:44.583 --> 05:47.586
- [cheers]
- Make way! Mama's
getting her steps in!

05:47.630 --> 05:49.371
In a wild turn of events,

05:49.414 --> 05:51.721
the Sue-zers and Elites
are officially tied!

05:52.896 --> 05:55.943
Ooh, you better kiss that
ball goodbye, Skyler!

05:55.986 --> 05:57.901
I'll make you eat those words!

05:57.945 --> 06:00.382
Hi... Yah!

06:01.296 --> 06:02.906
I should have said goodbye.

06:02.950 --> 06:05.909
Hey-oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

06:05.953 --> 06:07.345
[all[ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

06:07.389 --> 06:09.565
Oh, boy, Nancy's gone
beast-mode.

06:09.608 --> 06:11.784
I can finally respect her.

06:11.828 --> 06:14.962
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Oh, hey!
Did you drop something?

06:15.005 --> 06:16.441
What? I didn't drop anything.

06:16.485 --> 06:18.313
These hands are
incapable of dropping-

06:18.356 --> 06:19.618
[gasps]

06:19.662 --> 06:20.793
That's my thing!

06:20.837 --> 06:22.752
Sue-zers! Shame circle!

06:22.795 --> 06:25.842
- [kids chant] Loser! Loser!
- This one's also my thing!

06:25.886 --> 06:27.888
How's that for a taste
of your own medicine?

06:28.323 --> 06:31.761
After a rough start, the
Sue-zers have taken a huge lead,

06:31.804 --> 06:34.807
thanks to Nancy "definitely
an eleven-year-old" Green!

06:34.851 --> 06:36.940
Now, let's see if the Elites
can bring it back!

06:36.984 --> 06:40.857
You guys are making me look
like a fool out there!

06:40.901 --> 06:42.206
Sorry Coach,

06:42.250 --> 06:44.034
that Nancy kid's just too good!

06:44.078 --> 06:46.732
Ha! Just a few more outs
and the game's over!

06:46.776 --> 06:48.909
[Kiki]
Heck yeah, Nancy! Let's go!

06:48.952 --> 06:50.649
Time to take out the trash!

06:50.693 --> 06:52.869
- Huh?
- Yeah, flush those turds!

06:52.913 --> 06:54.349
Devour their hearts!

06:54.392 --> 06:55.872
Trample their souls!

06:55.916 --> 06:58.614
Whoa! Hey now!
Let's take it easy.

06:58.657 --> 07:01.138
Oh, yeah! We gonna win!
You gonna lose!

07:01.182 --> 07:02.574
Get him!

07:02.618 --> 07:04.315
No one's coming
to your birthday party.

07:04.359 --> 07:06.535
Aw, that's not true!
How do you know?

07:06.578 --> 07:08.929
- They told me.
- [cries]

07:08.972 --> 07:11.888
Huh, the Sue-zers are
getting really into the game.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.977
Ugh, whatever.
We're taking this win.

07:14.021 --> 07:16.284
Man, this team is mean.
I wanna go home.

07:16.327 --> 07:19.635
I never wanna play
organized sports again!

07:19.678 --> 07:21.463
Oh, this is my fault!

07:21.506 --> 07:23.552
By teaching my team
how to be good at sports,

07:23.595 --> 07:26.947
I also taught them how to be
bad at sports... manship!

07:26.990 --> 07:28.122
I gotta fix this!

07:28.165 --> 07:29.950
Sue-zers! Listen up!

07:30.994 --> 07:33.388
[Nancy] <i>
This has to stop... right now.</i>

07:33.431 --> 07:36.913
[Gabriella] <i>What?
But we're crushing them!
Why would we stop?</i>

07:36.957 --> 07:39.829
[Cricket] <i>Yeah! I thought
you said this was justice!</i>

07:39.872 --> 07:42.353
[Nancy] <i>It was!
But we took it too far!</i>

07:42.397 --> 07:44.138
<i>Just look at yourselves.</i>

07:44.181 --> 07:46.923
<i>We've become the monsters
we sought to destroy!</i>

07:46.967 --> 07:48.881
<i>I wanted to teach the other
team a lesson,</i>

07:48.925 --> 07:51.275
<i>but I never thought about
the lesson it'd teach you.</i>

07:51.319 --> 07:52.973
We gotta make this right!

07:53.016 --> 07:55.366
[Sue] <i>Spoken like a good sport!</i>

07:55.410 --> 07:56.822
[Benny] <i>Does this mean
you're gonna sit out</i>

07:56.846 --> 07:58.021
<i>and let me play?</i>

07:58.065 --> 07:59.153
[all] <i>No!</i>

07:59.196 --> 08:00.719
Come on!

08:01.329 --> 08:03.896
[Nancy] <i>The only way to settle
this is by throwing the game!</i>

08:03.940 --> 08:06.029
<i>And we gotta do it
without them knowing.</i>

08:06.073 --> 08:08.205
<i>Winning by cheating
isn't winning.</i>

08:08.249 --> 08:10.077
<i>Now, who's ready to lose?</i>

08:11.121 --> 08:12.229
[Cricket and Gabriella] <i>We are!</i>

08:12.253 --> 08:13.645
[all] <i>Yeah!</i>

08:15.430 --> 08:16.822
What's happening?

08:16.866 --> 08:18.999
Hm. This would never
happen in football.

08:19.042 --> 08:20.087
All right, team!

08:21.088 --> 08:22.828
Let's lose this thing!

08:22.872 --> 08:23.960
Batter up!

08:24.004 --> 08:27.485
[whimpers] End this, please.

08:27.529 --> 08:29.835
Heh. Today's your lucky day!

08:30.706 --> 08:31.707
Huh?

08:32.055 --> 08:34.753
What are you waiting for?
Run! Run! Run!

08:34.797 --> 08:36.799
Quick! Someone
throw me the ball!

08:36.842 --> 08:38.322
Oh, well. Good luck!

08:38.366 --> 08:41.238
I got it! I got it!
Oh, ow! [grunts]

08:41.282 --> 08:43.806
- Oh, I have tripped. Ah.
- [runner panting]

08:43.849 --> 08:45.677
Whoa! He's going for it!

08:45.721 --> 08:47.766
And he's driving the other
runners home, too!

08:47.810 --> 08:49.246
- Keep going!
- You can do it!

08:49.290 --> 08:51.248
I mean, "Oh, no!"

08:51.292 --> 08:53.685
I'll cover third!
Cricket, get the ball!

08:53.729 --> 08:55.818
On it! Here I come!

08:55.861 --> 08:57.167
Whoa! Oof!

08:57.211 --> 08:59.648
Attaboy, Cricket!
Way to sell it!

09:00.562 --> 09:01.824
Safe!

09:01.867 --> 09:02.931
- [kids cheer]
- -All right!

09:02.955 --> 09:04.696
Ha ha! Now we're talkin'!

09:07.699 --> 09:09.005
I got it, I got it!

09:09.049 --> 09:11.225
Whoops! How embarrassing!

09:11.268 --> 09:13.053
[grunts]

09:13.879 --> 09:14.880
Safe!

09:15.490 --> 09:16.858
[umpire]
It's the bottom of the ninth,

09:16.882 --> 09:18.580
and the score is all tied up!

09:18.623 --> 09:22.497
Next run wins
so let's play ball!

09:22.540 --> 09:24.499
[cheering]

09:24.542 --> 09:26.022
All right, Nancy,
you heard the ump.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.111
Time to go all out.

09:28.155 --> 09:30.592
[hard grunt]

09:34.074 --> 09:35.466
[gasp]

09:36.467 --> 09:39.905
It's gonna make it!
It's gonna make it!
Huh? Benny?!

09:39.949 --> 09:42.038
My talents have been ignored
for too long!

09:42.082 --> 09:43.561
I'm ending this charade!

09:43.605 --> 09:45.563
Justice!

09:45.607 --> 09:47.913
[screams]

09:47.957 --> 09:49.872
Ha ha ha ha ha!
What?!

09:49.915 --> 09:53.005
- [screaming]
- [both grunt]

09:53.049 --> 09:55.660
Home run! Elites win!

09:55.704 --> 09:57.184
[cheering]

09:57.227 --> 09:59.316
And the Sue-zers lose!

09:59.360 --> 10:01.536
[cheering]

10:01.579 --> 10:03.103
The perfect name.

10:03.494 --> 10:05.583
Sorry that we had to lose.

10:05.627 --> 10:08.369
It's okay, Mama, I'd rather be
a loser than a cheater.

10:08.412 --> 10:10.458
Assuming that winning
is off the table!

10:10.501 --> 10:13.722
Hey, losers!
Nice choke job!

10:13.765 --> 10:16.812
[laughs] Come on, kids!
We're gettin' wings!

10:16.855 --> 10:18.988
Hey, Sue-Zers! Good game!

10:20.946 --> 10:23.993
Well, gang, we may have
lost the game,

10:24.036 --> 10:27.910
but I have a feeling this is
gonna be a good season.

10:27.953 --> 10:28.954
[all] Yeah!
