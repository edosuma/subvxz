WEBVTT

00:04.707 --> 00:09.511
I am the electric Avenger!

00:11.481 --> 00:15.617
And I'm his trusty
sidekick, Spark Plug!

00:15.619 --> 00:17.953
Austin, you look awesome.

00:17.955 --> 00:21.189
And Dez, you look like...

00:21.191 --> 00:22.524
A garbage can.

00:22.526 --> 00:26.695
I was so busy making Austin's costume,
I didn't have time to work on mine.

00:26.697 --> 00:29.698
But I'm still a superhero who
keeps the streets clean.

00:29.700 --> 00:31.533
Of crime!

00:31.535 --> 00:33.835
And trash.

00:35.938 --> 00:38.640
Oh! Cute nurse's costume.

00:38.642 --> 00:40.275
Oh, this isn't a costume.

00:40.277 --> 00:41.543
I got a job at a nursing home.

00:41.545 --> 00:42.911
It's perfect...

00:42.913 --> 00:44.849
me and the old people take
naps at the same time.

00:44.880 --> 00:47.482
Well, you can still wear it to
Jimmy Starr's Halloween party.

00:47.484 --> 00:48.617
Whoo!

00:48.619 --> 00:49.951
Looks like we're
all ready to go.

00:49.953 --> 00:51.486
And when I say
"we're all ready,"

00:51.488 --> 00:52.954
I mean, Ally, hurry
up and get ready.

00:52.956 --> 00:54.589
Just give me a sec.

00:56.959 --> 00:58.527
Ah!

01:00.596 --> 01:01.863
All set.

01:01.865 --> 01:02.998
Guess who I am.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.734
Glass-thingy-in-her-eye girl?

01:05.736 --> 01:07.269
No!

01:07.271 --> 01:10.539
I'm Sylvia Von Harden.

01:10.541 --> 01:12.441
German?

01:12.443 --> 01:14.843
1920s?

01:14.845 --> 01:16.912
Influential journalist and poet?

01:16.914 --> 01:19.981
Oh, that Sylvia Von Harden.

01:22.252 --> 01:23.385
Oh...

01:23.387 --> 01:25.287
Is it just me, or did
the lights go out?

01:25.289 --> 01:27.289
The lights went out.

01:27.291 --> 01:29.624
Is it just me, or did
someone just scream?

01:29.626 --> 01:31.026
You just screamed.

01:31.028 --> 01:33.628
Is it just me, or do I keep
saying "is it just me"?

01:34.597 --> 01:36.264
There's no need to panic.

01:36.266 --> 01:38.667
It's not like we're stuck here.

01:42.639 --> 01:44.039
Okay, panic. We're stuck here.

01:44.041 --> 01:46.908
My dad installed
automatic door locks.

01:46.910 --> 01:49.444
We can't leave until the
power comes back on.

01:49.446 --> 01:51.880
That means we're trapped
in a dark music store

01:51.882 --> 01:53.949
on the scariest
night of the year.

01:53.951 --> 01:58.987
The night the headless security guard
roams the mall looking for a new head.

02:00.958 --> 02:02.724
Me again?

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:58.047 --> 03:00.715
I can't get a hold of my dad.

03:00.717 --> 03:02.651
Who knows how long we're
going to be stuck here?

03:02.653 --> 03:04.019
Ah, man.

03:04.021 --> 03:05.420
We're going to miss
Jimmy's party.

03:05.422 --> 03:08.757
And get our heads chopped off
by the headless security guard!

03:08.759 --> 03:11.026
Muah-ha-ha-ha-ha...

03:11.028 --> 03:13.395
Actually, he doesn't
have an evil laugh.

03:13.397 --> 03:14.729
He doesn't have a mouth.

03:15.932 --> 03:20.001
Hey, why don't we have a contest to
see who can tell the scariest story?

03:20.003 --> 03:20.912
Oh, great idea.

03:20.943 --> 03:23.638
I'm totally going to
beat you and Dez.

03:23.640 --> 03:24.906
What about me?

03:27.911 --> 03:30.812
Hey! Just because I
don't like being scared

03:30.814 --> 03:32.847
doesn't mean I can't
scare you guys.

03:32.849 --> 03:34.049
Ally, please.

03:34.051 --> 03:35.951
Leave the scary stuff
to the experts.

03:35.953 --> 03:37.018
Hey, what's that in the window?

03:37.020 --> 03:39.020
What?

03:39.022 --> 03:40.956
Boo!

03:43.961 --> 03:47.128
Dez, don't scare Ally like that.

03:47.130 --> 03:49.064
Scare her like this.

03:51.868 --> 03:53.435
Guys, stop it.

03:53.437 --> 03:54.769
It's okay, Ally.

03:54.771 --> 03:56.504
I won't scare you.

03:56.506 --> 03:58.006
Thanks, Trish.

04:01.778 --> 04:04.412
Can you guys just tell
your stupid stories?

04:04.414 --> 04:06.748
Okay, I'll go first.

04:06.750 --> 04:11.786
My story's called "the creature
from the South Beach swamp."

04:11.788 --> 04:15.690
It was a dark and foggy night.

04:15.692 --> 04:18.493
Mm-hmm. Okay.

04:18.495 --> 04:20.595
Tell me what happened.

04:20.596 --> 04:23.765
Well, I was standing right
where you're standing,

04:23.767 --> 04:26.001
when this tall green thing
came out of the water.

04:26.003 --> 04:29.938
Sounds like the South beach
swamp creature to me.

04:29.940 --> 04:32.841
He's been terrorizing
these parts for years.

04:32.843 --> 04:37.746
They say he emerges from the water,
sneaking up behind his victims.

04:37.748 --> 04:41.216
Rumor has it, he's covered in
green moss, walks with a limp,

04:41.218 --> 04:44.052
and before he drags his
victims to a watery grave,

04:44.054 --> 04:47.122
he makes an eerie, low moan.

04:48.892 --> 04:51.893
Mm-hmm, just like that.

04:59.069 --> 05:00.835
No! Don't take me.

05:00.837 --> 05:02.470
I'm too pretty to die.

05:02.472 --> 05:03.805
No!

05:05.207 --> 05:08.109
Be your friend. Hmm.

05:08.111 --> 05:09.978
No!

05:09.980 --> 05:11.179
Wait...

05:11.181 --> 05:14.115
Did you say "be your friend"
or "eat you, friend"?

05:14.117 --> 05:15.684
Uh...

05:15.686 --> 05:17.919
The first one.

05:17.921 --> 05:19.821
Whoo! All right.

05:21.024 --> 05:22.624
It was horrible.

05:22.626 --> 05:25.560
He was tall, smelly
and disgusting.

05:28.998 --> 05:30.265
There he is!

05:30.267 --> 05:32.033
And the swamp
creature's with him.

05:34.905 --> 05:36.204
Don't hurt us.

05:36.206 --> 05:38.573
I'm too pretty to die.

05:38.575 --> 05:39.908
Don't be scared.

05:39.910 --> 05:42.110
He's just like me and you.

05:45.549 --> 05:48.183
Except apparently he
eats tambourines. Whoo!

05:49.285 --> 05:51.986
Don't be alarmed by
his backwoods ways.

05:51.988 --> 05:54.189
He's just misunderstood.
Look what I taught him.

05:55.926 --> 05:57.192
What up?

05:58.962 --> 06:00.628
What are you going
to do with him?

06:00.630 --> 06:02.263
You can't just send him
back to the swamp.

06:02.265 --> 06:07.068
That poor, hideous thing
must be so lonely.

06:07.070 --> 06:09.938
We gotta get him out of here
before people try to hurt him.

06:09.940 --> 06:12.864
People are only afraid of the swamp
creature because he's different.

06:12.895 --> 06:15.610
We need to show the townsfolk
that he's just like them.

06:15.612 --> 06:17.078
There's only one way to do that.

06:17.080 --> 06:19.180
Slowly integrate
him into society

06:19.182 --> 06:21.616
by teaching him manners
and our social norms?

06:21.618 --> 06:22.984
No.

06:22.986 --> 06:25.120
We're going to do a
song-and-dance routine.

06:26.088 --> 06:27.622
Mm-hmm.

06:27.624 --> 06:32.794
Ladies and gentlemen, for years we've
been terrified of the swamp creature.

06:32.796 --> 06:35.130
But tonight, you'll see
there's nothing to fear.

06:35.132 --> 06:36.331
Come on out, swampy.

06:38.101 --> 06:40.635
No no! Don't be afraid.

06:40.637 --> 06:42.103
Wait till you see his footwork.

06:42.105 --> 06:43.905
Mm-hmm.

06:43.907 --> 06:44.973
Hit it!

07:40.029 --> 07:41.729
Litter bug!

07:46.303 --> 07:48.303
Calm down. He's harmless!

07:51.641 --> 07:55.176
Okay, maybe he's
extremely dangerous.

08:00.650 --> 08:03.184
For someone who hates littering,
he's sure making a mess.

08:07.057 --> 08:10.024
What were you thinking, swampy?

08:10.026 --> 08:12.660
You can't just go crazy in
front of people like that.

08:12.662 --> 08:15.196
Now we're never going
to make it to Broadway.

08:15.198 --> 08:19.033
Mm-mm.

08:19.035 --> 08:22.036
<i>Knowing the swamp creature could
never live amongst humans,</i>

08:22.038 --> 08:25.106
<i>sheriff Dez took him back
to the South Beach swamp.</i>

08:25.108 --> 08:27.075
Knowing you can never
live amongst us humans,

08:27.077 --> 08:30.144
I've taken you back to
the South Beach swamp.

08:34.017 --> 08:36.083
I'm going to miss you.

08:37.919 --> 08:40.121
What up?

08:40.123 --> 08:41.422
Friends forever?

08:41.424 --> 08:44.025
Friends forever.

08:47.897 --> 08:49.264
All right, big guy.

08:49.266 --> 08:50.732
You can let go now.

08:50.734 --> 08:52.033
Forever.

08:52.035 --> 08:53.234
What? No!

08:53.236 --> 08:55.236
I don't want to go
to a watery grave.

08:55.238 --> 08:57.872
I told you, I'm too
pretty to die!

08:57.874 --> 09:01.476
No!

09:10.253 --> 09:13.955
So the swamp creature took the
sheriff to a watery grave?

09:13.957 --> 09:18.726
<i>Yep. I guess you could say they
lived happily never after.</i>

09:21.298 --> 09:22.897
Not scary.

09:22.899 --> 09:24.766
On a scale of...

09:24.768 --> 09:26.000
To...

09:26.002 --> 09:27.835
I give it a... meh.

09:28.971 --> 09:30.905
Ooh! My turn.

09:30.907 --> 09:34.175
Get ready for "the tale
of the haunted violin."

09:34.177 --> 09:36.844
It was a dark and foggy night.

09:46.055 --> 09:50.491
Wow! Esmeralda, are you sure
you've never taken lessons before?

09:50.493 --> 09:52.994
I've been playing for years.

09:52.996 --> 09:56.264
Maybe you should be
giving me lessons.

09:58.201 --> 10:01.803
Okay.

10:01.805 --> 10:03.171
See you tomorrow.

10:03.173 --> 10:04.939
Hey, Ally.

10:05.908 --> 10:07.942
Hey, Esmeralda.

10:07.944 --> 10:09.811
Up high?

10:09.813 --> 10:13.147
Down low. Too slow!

10:13.149 --> 10:15.350
Oh, I love that kid.

10:15.352 --> 10:18.119
Hey, have you seen my guitar?

10:18.121 --> 10:19.320
It's like it just vanished.

10:19.322 --> 10:24.792
No, but that's not the first
instrument that's gone missing.

10:24.794 --> 10:28.296
A lot of weird stuff has
been going on around here.

10:33.969 --> 10:35.370
Ah! Like that.

10:35.372 --> 10:36.537
What's going on?

10:41.945 --> 10:45.079
Guess who's here to haunt you!

10:45.081 --> 10:47.215
Who are you?

10:47.217 --> 10:49.250
I am Patricia.

10:49.252 --> 10:52.220
You sold my violin,
and I want it back.

10:52.222 --> 10:53.588
She... she... she sold it.

10:53.590 --> 10:55.023
I don't even work here.

10:55.025 --> 10:59.060
Uh, we sell lots of violins.

10:59.062 --> 11:01.062
Can you be more specific?

11:01.064 --> 11:02.864
Mahogany, yea big.

11:02.866 --> 11:04.565
It says "haunted" on the case.

11:04.567 --> 11:06.901
Oh, that one.

11:06.903 --> 11:08.236
It was a phone order.

11:08.238 --> 11:09.904
I sold it a couple of weeks ago.

11:09.906 --> 11:11.072
I think I still
have the address.

11:11.074 --> 11:15.209
Well, get it back, or I
will haunt you forever!

11:18.048 --> 11:19.847
You mean you'll
haunt her, right?

11:19.849 --> 11:20.882
'Cause again, I
don't even work...

11:20.884 --> 11:22.283
get my violin!

11:27.056 --> 11:30.191
<i>So they traced the address of the
customer who bought the violin,</i>

11:30.193 --> 11:33.194
<i>and it led them to
an unusual location.</i>

11:33.196 --> 11:34.929
A cemetery?

11:34.931 --> 11:37.899
What an unusual location.

11:40.370 --> 11:42.003
Do you hear that?

11:43.138 --> 11:45.940
I can't hear anything over
that creepy violin music.

11:45.942 --> 11:49.644
I'm talking about the
creepy violin music.

11:51.113 --> 11:53.414
So you sold the violin to a
guy who lives at a cemetery?

11:53.416 --> 11:54.916
Yeah.

11:54.918 --> 11:57.151
His name is Dezmond
Moorehouse III.

11:57.153 --> 11:59.620
That's the name on
that gravestone.

12:01.123 --> 12:02.457
That means...

12:02.459 --> 12:04.625
I sold the violin to a...

12:06.329 --> 12:07.995
Yep. A dead guy!

12:12.134 --> 12:14.235
Has Patricia sent
you for the violin?

12:14.237 --> 12:16.270
You know her?

12:16.272 --> 12:19.273
She used to be my love, but then
we quarreled on her birthday

12:19.275 --> 12:22.376
and she hasn't talked
to me in two centuries.

12:22.378 --> 12:23.678
Ohh.

12:23.680 --> 12:25.446
How sad.

12:25.448 --> 12:27.115
And terrifying.

12:27.117 --> 12:30.151
But, um, mostly sad.

12:30.153 --> 12:33.054
I bought her violin, hoping
it would lure her to me.

12:33.056 --> 12:35.389
Um...

12:35.391 --> 12:39.193
If we want Patricia to
stop haunting sonic boom,

12:39.195 --> 12:41.696
we need to get her and
Dezmond back together.

12:41.698 --> 12:45.933
We'll tell her we found her
violin at the cemetery.

12:45.935 --> 12:48.202
When she gets here,
Dezmond can win her back.

12:49.339 --> 12:51.005
It shouldn't be too hard.

12:51.007 --> 12:53.341
<i>He's drop dead gorgeous.</i>

13:01.049 --> 13:03.184
So, you found my violin?

13:03.186 --> 13:06.988
Yes, but we don't have it.

13:06.990 --> 13:08.089
Who does?

13:09.391 --> 13:11.726
Hello, Patricia.

13:11.728 --> 13:12.727
You.

13:12.729 --> 13:15.396
You look good.

13:15.398 --> 13:18.266
You don't look a day over 250.

13:18.268 --> 13:20.601
I'm still not talking to you.

13:20.603 --> 13:24.038
What kind of husband puts
dynamite on a birthday cake?

13:24.040 --> 13:26.107
I thought they were
really big candles.

13:27.075 --> 13:28.976
I made a wish and
my head blew off.

13:28.978 --> 13:30.211
Mine blew off as well!

13:30.213 --> 13:31.746
Guys guys.

13:31.748 --> 13:34.715
Forget who blew up who.
That was a long time ago.

13:34.717 --> 13:39.086
The point is, he took your violin
so that you would come back to him.

13:39.088 --> 13:41.222
Is that true, Dezmond?

13:41.224 --> 13:44.392
I guess I still have
feelings for you.

13:44.394 --> 13:45.526
I guess I've always...

13:45.528 --> 13:47.128
stop talking and come here.

13:47.130 --> 13:51.232
I may be dead, but I don't have
eternity to listen to you blabber on.

13:53.569 --> 13:56.103
Aww.

13:57.740 --> 14:00.174
Excuse me? A little
privacy here.

14:00.176 --> 14:03.044
You're the ones who
can disappear.

14:03.046 --> 14:05.112
Oh, right.

14:10.252 --> 14:12.253
I'm glad we got
them back together.

14:12.255 --> 14:14.755
Yeah. And now that Patricia
has her violin back,

14:14.757 --> 14:16.524
sonic boom won't be
haunted anymore.

14:22.599 --> 14:24.732
Or not.

14:24.734 --> 14:27.568
Hello.

14:27.570 --> 14:30.342
Esmeralda, what are
you doing here?

14:30.373 --> 14:33.608
I wanted to thank you for getting
my parents back together.

14:33.610 --> 14:35.076
Wait.

14:35.078 --> 14:37.211
Your parents are
Patricia and Dezmond?

14:42.752 --> 14:45.753
I've been giving
lessons to a ghost.

14:45.755 --> 14:48.422
I said I've been
playing for years.

14:48.424 --> 14:50.157
Hundreds of years.

14:50.159 --> 14:53.094
And I'm gonna haunt
you for 100 more.

14:57.599 --> 15:00.501
By the way, I can't make
my lesson next Tuesday.

15:00.503 --> 15:02.536
I have a dentist appointment!

15:09.211 --> 15:12.546
And that's the story
of the haunted violin.

15:12.548 --> 15:15.082
Esmeralda still haunts
the music store...

15:15.084 --> 15:17.551
To this day!

15:17.553 --> 15:19.720
Uh, now I really want
to get out of here.

15:19.722 --> 15:23.224
Please, the only thing scary
about being trapped here

15:23.226 --> 15:25.226
is having to listen to
Dez's lame stories.

15:26.261 --> 15:29.196
I hope the power comes on soon.

15:29.198 --> 15:33.701
They say the headless security guard
makes his final rounds at midnight.

15:33.703 --> 15:34.597
Relax, Ally.

15:34.628 --> 15:38.172
You're not gonna lose your head
for another... four minutes.

15:38.174 --> 15:39.373
Oh, good.

15:39.375 --> 15:41.575
So I still have time
to tell my story.

15:41.577 --> 15:44.779
I call it "the
Teddy bear scare."

15:44.781 --> 15:48.616
Four friends were coming back
from a fun day at the carnival.

15:48.618 --> 15:50.284
Awesome!

15:50.286 --> 15:52.186
Man, I love the carnival.

15:52.188 --> 15:54.221
Those bumper cars
were so much fun.

15:54.223 --> 15:56.424
That was the parking lot.

15:56.426 --> 15:58.326
And next time, I'm driving.

15:59.428 --> 16:01.562
I can't believe you
won that bear.

16:01.564 --> 16:02.663
I don't even want it.

16:02.665 --> 16:03.831
You guys want it?

16:03.833 --> 16:04.393
Oh, no, thanks.

16:04.424 --> 16:08.669
I'd take it, but there's not enough
room on my bed for another stuffed...

16:08.671 --> 16:09.904
I mean...

16:09.906 --> 16:12.239
I'm a little old for
stuffed animals,

16:12.241 --> 16:13.741
don't you think?

16:13.743 --> 16:16.911
Something about this
thing's eyes freak me out.

16:16.913 --> 16:18.312
I'm getting rid of it.

16:18.314 --> 16:19.847
That reminds me.

16:19.849 --> 16:22.650
I told my dad we'd clean
the upstairs refrigerator.

16:22.652 --> 16:25.786
Those old leftovers are
starting to smell.

16:25.788 --> 16:27.688
Oh, yes! I'm starving.

16:28.924 --> 16:30.191
Whoo!

16:31.426 --> 16:33.160
Oh!

16:33.162 --> 16:35.229
You can smell those
leftovers from...

16:37.432 --> 16:39.900
wait, isn't that the bear
you just threw away?

16:39.902 --> 16:42.336
Yeah. That's weird.

16:42.338 --> 16:45.439
How did it get up here?

16:45.441 --> 16:49.243
Guys, there's a perfectly
good explanation for this.

16:49.245 --> 16:52.813
There's clearly a space-time vortex
in the downstairs garbage can.

16:54.282 --> 16:57.184
I don't know what the explanation
is, but it's definitely not that.

16:57.186 --> 17:01.689
I don't care how it got up
here, just get rid of it.

17:02.691 --> 17:03.891
Let's throw it out the window.

17:03.893 --> 17:05.960
Yeah. Let's do it.

17:10.465 --> 17:12.199
<i>Ohh!</i>

17:14.502 --> 17:16.837
- Whoo!
- Looks like that truck took care of it.

17:20.410 --> 17:24.645
Guys, there's obviously
an explanation for this.

17:24.646 --> 17:25.913
There's a second vortex...

17:25.915 --> 17:28.549
there's no vortex! That
thing's possessed.

17:28.550 --> 17:30.251
This is really creeping me out.

17:30.253 --> 17:31.919
I can't look at
its eyes anymore.

17:31.921 --> 17:33.641
I'll take care of it.
I'll take care of it.

17:38.593 --> 17:40.227
Oh, get it.

17:43.933 --> 17:46.367
You don't think...?

17:51.473 --> 17:52.540
Go.

18:03.452 --> 18:04.852
Okay.

18:06.788 --> 18:09.323
Okay, this has to work.

18:20.735 --> 18:22.390
<i>When nothing seemed to work,</i>

18:22.421 --> 18:24.638
<i>the gang was forced to
take extreme measures.</i>

18:24.640 --> 18:26.307
All right, that's it.

18:26.309 --> 18:27.842
We have to take
extreme measures.

18:27.844 --> 18:29.810
Everybody, grab a leg.

18:29.812 --> 18:30.878
Okay.

18:32.280 --> 18:35.483
Not my leg. The bear's leg.

18:42.791 --> 18:46.594
Okay, I'm sending its right arm to
China and its left arm to France.

18:46.596 --> 18:49.997
And I'm sending its belly to
Alaska and its legs to Africa.

18:51.399 --> 18:53.067
And I'm sending
its head to Fiji.

18:53.069 --> 18:55.369
I hear it's lovely
this time of year.

18:57.806 --> 18:59.006
Okay.

18:59.008 --> 19:01.475
Whoo.

19:01.477 --> 19:03.944
Well, now that this is
over I'm gonna take a nap.

19:03.946 --> 19:07.014
I can finally sleep knowing I'm
never gonna see that bear again.

19:07.016 --> 19:08.616
Yeah.

19:20.663 --> 19:23.564
I think I'll take that best
scary story prize now.

19:23.566 --> 19:25.332
We haven't heard
Ally's story yet.

19:25.334 --> 19:26.734
I bet it's really scary...

19:30.105 --> 19:32.473
Hey, the lights are back on.

19:32.475 --> 19:34.475
Finally, we can get out of here.

19:34.477 --> 19:36.944
It's midnight. You
know what that means.

19:36.946 --> 19:37.978
Oh, yeah.

19:37.980 --> 19:41.081
Happy new year.

19:41.083 --> 19:42.483
No!

19:42.485 --> 19:45.986
The headless security guard makes
his final rounds at midnight.

19:47.657 --> 19:48.856
Do you hear that?

19:48.858 --> 19:49.990
Look!

19:52.061 --> 19:53.561
The headless security guard!

19:53.563 --> 19:56.096
Run for your lives!

19:58.967 --> 20:01.802
Come on, guys. We're running...

20:01.804 --> 20:03.837
From the guy with no head.

20:05.540 --> 20:06.941
Nice try, Ally.

20:06.943 --> 20:08.943
Yeah, you're not fooling us.

20:08.945 --> 20:11.478
That's George, the real
mall security guard.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.013
Fine.

20:13.015 --> 20:15.015
You can come out from
under there, George.

20:15.017 --> 20:18.686
I told you they
wouldn't fall for it.

20:18.688 --> 20:20.955
Ally, you're just not cut
for this kind of stuff.

20:20.957 --> 20:23.857
Your idea of scary is getting
a "b-plus" on a test.

20:27.562 --> 20:29.396
Ha ha. Very funny.

20:29.398 --> 20:31.999
Yeah, Ally. You're so
not scary, it's scary.

20:32.001 --> 20:33.734
Okay, I get it.

20:33.736 --> 20:36.103
I told you. Leave the scary
stuff to the professionals.

20:36.105 --> 20:37.705
Boo!

20:37.707 --> 20:39.039
I said "I get it."

20:39.041 --> 20:41.175
I get it, I get it, I get it!

20:50.051 --> 20:51.552
What's wrong with Ally?!

20:51.554 --> 20:53.053
I think she's possessed!

20:53.055 --> 20:54.922
So you're not scared of me?

20:54.924 --> 20:56.523
How about now?!

21:05.667 --> 21:07.001
Yes, we're scared.

21:07.003 --> 21:09.603
Please don't hurt us.
I'm too pretty to die.

21:12.775 --> 21:15.843
I got you.

21:20.849 --> 21:23.017
- What?
- I just scared you guys

21:23.019 --> 21:24.084
big time.

21:24.086 --> 21:25.486
Wait.

21:25.488 --> 21:26.954
That was all a prank?

21:26.956 --> 21:29.623
That's right. I planned it all.

21:29.625 --> 21:33.894
The lights, the tables, the instruments,
the security guard. Everything.

21:33.896 --> 21:34.895
I can't believe you got us.

21:34.897 --> 21:35.929
I was terrified.

21:35.931 --> 21:38.565
Yeah, not cool, Ally. Not cool.

21:38.567 --> 21:41.932
She may have fooled you guys,
but she didn't fool me.

21:41.963 --> 21:44.505
I knew it was fake.
It was so obvious.

21:44.507 --> 21:47.207
Boo!

21:55.817 --> 21:58.919
Wasn't Halloween
great this year?

21:58.921 --> 22:01.855
Yeah, it was great how you
pulled that prank on us.

22:01.857 --> 22:03.724
You don't have to
keep bringing it up.

22:03.726 --> 22:07.561
Remember when you guys huddled
together and were about to cry?

22:09.130 --> 22:11.065
That was hilarious.

22:11.067 --> 22:13.200
It's not funny anymore.

22:14.969 --> 22:16.804
Excuse me?

22:16.806 --> 22:19.506
I'm here to sign up
for music lessons.

22:19.508 --> 22:22.876
I hope you don't mind, I
brought my Teddy bear with me.
