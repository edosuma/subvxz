WEBVTT

00:07.758 --> 00:09.629
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.630 --> 00:13.513
OKAY, GUYS, LET'S SEE WHICH ONE OF
YOU CAN SPOT WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.516
IT'S FINE, RIGHT?

00:16.517 --> 00:19.599
- I DON'T... I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S FINE, DUDE.
- REALLY... SO... BUT...

00:19.600 --> 00:20.900
OH, COME ON, IT'S
A SCHOOL DANCE.

00:20.901 --> 00:23.022
YOU DON'T WANT LONG SLEEVES
AND CUFFS TRIPPING YOU UP.

00:23.023 --> 00:26.647
BESIDES, PEOPLE ARE GONNA
BE WATCHING MY MOVES.

00:27.858 --> 00:30.070
YEAH, SO THEY KNOW
WHAT NOT TO DO.

00:30.071 --> 00:34.244
YO, I'M... I'M GONNA SAY THIS TO
YOU AS CONSTRUCTIVELY AS I CAN.

00:34.245 --> 00:36.576
YOU LOOK LIKE AN
ORGAN-GRINDER'S MONKEY, MAN.

00:36.577 --> 00:38.828
OKAY, LOOK, HERE'S THE THING...

00:38.829 --> 00:41.961
- YOU AND I ARE GONNA GO...
- NO. PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME GO SHOPPING WITH YOU.

00:41.962 --> 00:45.004
- WELL, I WON'T TELL ANYONE I'M YOUR AUNT.
- THEY'LL KNOW, OKAY?

00:45.005 --> 00:46.427
( softly ) THEY'LL KNOW.

00:47.878 --> 00:49.669
RYDER, YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE DANCE RIGHT?

00:49.670 --> 00:51.171
YOU WANT YOUR GIRL TO THINK
YOU LOOK HOT, RIGHT?

00:51.172 --> 00:53.433
- YEAH.
- WHAT YOU'RE WEARING RIGHT NOW, THAT IS...

00:53.434 --> 00:55.635
THAT IS A GIRL REPELLANT.

00:55.636 --> 00:58.179
YEAH, AND YOU'VE ALREADY
KIND OF GOT THAT NATURALLY.

00:59.270 --> 01:00.890
OKAY. OKAY, FINE.

01:00.891 --> 01:02.682
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL GET A SUIT.

01:02.683 --> 01:04.984
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, STELLA STILL
NEEDS A SITTER FOR THE BABY

01:04.985 --> 01:06.856
AND THE DANCE IS
THIS SATURDAY, SO...

01:06.857 --> 01:08.568
OH. WELL, I'M HAPPY TO...

01:08.569 --> 01:10.360
HELP YOU FIND SOMEONE.

01:10.361 --> 01:12.031
- LENNOX, YOU DO IT.
- NO WAY.

01:12.032 --> 01:13.953
- I'LL PAY YOU A HUNDRED DOLLARS.
- SOLD.

01:13.954 --> 01:16.746
FOR ONE NIGHT?! THAT'S MORE THAN I
GOT PAID WHEN I WAS WORKING HERE!

01:16.747 --> 01:18.868
WELL, SHE'S A BETTER NEGOTIATOR.

01:18.869 --> 01:20.660
OKAY, GREAT, SO
IT'S FIGURED OUT.

01:20.661 --> 01:22.962
- LENNOX IS BABYSITTING.
- EXCEPT I DON'T DO PEEK-A-BOO,

01:22.963 --> 01:24.874
FUNNY FACES OR TUMMY FARTS,

01:24.875 --> 01:26.466
'CAUSE YOU KNOW,
THAT'S JUST DEGRADING.

01:26.467 --> 01:28.968
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A GREAT MOM.

01:28.969 --> 01:30.510
NOT FOR YEARS AND YEARS.

01:30.511 --> 01:32.672
( chuckles ) I LIKE
THE SOUND OF THAT.

01:32.673 --> 01:34.714
SO, JOE, I WAS THINKING...

01:34.715 --> 01:37.016
SATURDAY NIGHT, RYDER
HAS HIS DANCE,

01:37.017 --> 01:38.718
AND LENNOX IS GONNA BE
BABYSITTING ISABEL.

01:38.719 --> 01:41.931
I THOUGHT MAYBE THE TWO OF US
COULD GET OUT OF THE HOUSE.

01:41.932 --> 01:43.893
- OOH! MAYBE A LITTLE DRESS-UP, HUH?
- MMM.

01:43.894 --> 01:46.776
- WE GO DANCING A LITTLE BIT?
- YEAH, AND I KNOW JUST THE PLACE.

01:46.777 --> 01:49.440
- YEAH?
- ( sweetly ) RYDER'S HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM.

01:50.731 --> 01:51.731
I'M SORRY. WHAT DID YOU SAY?

01:51.732 --> 01:53.323
YEAH, THEY NEEDED CHAPERONES,

01:53.324 --> 01:55.655
- AND I VOLUNTEERED.
- ( snorts ) THAT'S AWESOME.

01:55.656 --> 01:57.036
- YEAH.
- YOU CHAPERONING.

01:57.037 --> 02:00.331
NO NO NO. WE'RE CHAPERONING.

02:26.267 --> 02:28.398
WELL, IT WON'T BE
LAME IF WE'RE THERE

02:28.399 --> 02:31.030
GETTING ALL FUNKY AND CRUNKY

02:31.031 --> 02:34.234
AND MAKING SURE THE
KIDS DON'T GET DRUNKY.

02:34.235 --> 02:36.035
KEEPING A BUNCH OF
PIMPLY 17-YEAR-OLD KIDS

02:36.036 --> 02:37.777
FROM GROPING EACH OTHER ALL
NIGHT IS LIKE TORTURE.

02:37.778 --> 02:42.372
IT'S LIKE WATERBOARDING SET TO...
DUBSTEP.

02:42.373 --> 02:44.744
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S THE DEAL: EVERY
HOUSEHOLD HAS TO VOLUNTEER

02:44.745 --> 02:46.586
A CERTAIN NUMBER OF
HOURS, AND I'VE KINDA

02:46.587 --> 02:48.958
NOT BEEN DOING THAT FOR
THE LAST FEW... EVER.

02:48.959 --> 02:50.840
I SEE, SO NOW YOU'RE
FEELING REMORSEFUL.

02:50.841 --> 02:53.923
NO. THE SCHOOL STARTED
A NEW POLICY,

02:53.924 --> 02:55.755
AND IF YOU DON'T DO YOUR HOURS,

02:55.756 --> 02:57.507
THEY POST YOUR PHOTO
ON THEIR WEB SITE,

02:57.508 --> 02:59.259
"MEET THE DEADBEAT PARENTS."

02:59.260 --> 03:02.762
PUBLIC SHAMING... THE
WORLD'S GREATEST MOTIVATOR.

03:02.763 --> 03:04.304
LOOK, THE DANCE IS FROM
8:00 UNTIL MIDNIGHT,

03:04.305 --> 03:06.436
SO WE SAY WE GOT THERE AT
4:00 AND WE LEFT AT 1:00.

03:06.437 --> 03:08.478
THAT'S NINE HOURS EACH.
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I NEED.

03:08.479 --> 03:11.611
OTHERWISE, THEY'RE GONNA
POST THIS PHOTO OF ME.

03:11.612 --> 03:13.863
OH MY GOD, HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

03:13.864 --> 03:15.986
I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF SNEEZING.

03:17.278 --> 03:18.988
COME ON, CHAPERONE WITH ME.

03:18.989 --> 03:21.951
- I'LL OWE YOU ONE.
- ONE WHAT?

03:21.952 --> 03:25.204
YOU KNOW... THAT.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.876
DONE.

03:26.877 --> 03:28.878
- YOU'RE EASY.
- HEY, HEY.

03:28.879 --> 03:30.831
ONLY 'CAUSE MY BIRTHDAY'S
A LONG WAY OFF.

03:32.673 --> 03:33.884
( whistle tweets )

03:38.299 --> 03:40.930
HI. OH, EXCUSE ME.
STELLA, STELLA.

03:40.931 --> 03:43.933
- OH!
- SORRY. DID YOU... DID YOU GET MY LAST COUPLE OF TEXTS?

03:43.934 --> 03:46.936
UH, YEAH YEAH. I DON'T
THINK I READ 'EM.

03:46.937 --> 03:49.188
OH. OKAY. WELL, SPOILER ALERT:

03:49.189 --> 03:51.060
LENNOX CAN BABYSIT THE
NIGHT OF THE DANCE,

03:51.061 --> 03:54.314
SO YOUR DAUGHTER WILL BE
IN RELATIVELY GOOD HANDS.

03:54.315 --> 03:56.696
( flatly ) GREAT. I'M REALLY
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. UH-HUH.

03:56.697 --> 03:57.987
- GREAT. THIS WILL BE GREAT.
- YEAH.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.238
HEY, I GOT A NEW SUIT FOR YOU,

03:59.239 --> 04:01.281
SO I'M GONNA BE
LOOKING VERY JAY-Z.

04:01.282 --> 04:04.325
AND I'M TALKING TO YOUR BUTT.

04:07.167 --> 04:09.459
SHE TELLS ME SHE NEEDS A
SITTER, SO I FIND HER ONE.

04:09.460 --> 04:11.210
THEN I TELL HER THAT I'M GETTING
A NEW SUIT FOR THE DANCE,

04:11.211 --> 04:12.922
AND SHE DOESN'T EVEN CARE.
IT'S LIKE...

04:12.923 --> 04:15.505
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING
I SAY PUTS HER IN A BAD MOOD.

04:15.506 --> 04:18.838
WHY DON'T YOU STOP...
SAYING STUFF?

04:18.839 --> 04:20.840
AND SHE NEVER
RESPONDS TO MY TEXTS.

04:20.841 --> 04:22.802
SHE LITERALLY RUNS AWAY
WHEN I'M TALKING TO HER.

04:22.803 --> 04:25.144
IT'S LIKE... I DON'T KNOW.

04:25.145 --> 04:27.147
I STILL LIKE HER, BUT...

04:28.649 --> 04:31.601
I DON'T THINK SHE
LIKES ME ANYMORE.

04:31.602 --> 04:33.733
HEY, MAN, IF SHE DOESN'T
LIKE YOU ANYMORE, MAYBE...

04:33.734 --> 04:35.856
- MAYBE IT'S OVER.
- OVER?

04:37.488 --> 04:38.988
SHE'S MY GIRLFRIEND.

04:38.989 --> 04:41.451
I MEAN, I REALLY CARE ABOUT HER.

04:41.452 --> 04:42.532
SHE'S MY STELLA BELLA

04:42.533 --> 04:44.785
AND I'M HER STELLA FELLA.

04:46.327 --> 04:47.957
LISTEN, MAN. ( chuckles )

04:47.958 --> 04:49.959
YOU KNOW, STAYING IN A
MISERABLE RELATIONSHIP

04:49.960 --> 04:51.711
AND JUST SLOGGING
THROUGH IT IS...

04:51.712 --> 04:54.083
THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME FOR
THAT WHEN YOU GET MARRIED.

04:54.084 --> 04:57.337
I MEAN, IF YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT HER,
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST BREAK UP WITH HER.

04:57.338 --> 05:00.299
- DOESN'T THAT MAKE ME THE JERK?
- NO NO, YOU'D ACTUALLY BE DOING HER A FAVOR.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.841
COME ON, THAT'S WHAT'S
SO GREAT ABOUT BEING

05:01.842 --> 05:03.683
IN A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP
WHEN YOU'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL...

05:03.684 --> 05:05.976
YOU GET TO BREAK UP WITH THE
PERSON WITHOUT LOSING YOUR HOUSE.

05:07.307 --> 05:11.020
YOU GOTTA... YOU GOTTA
CHERISH THIS TIME.

05:11.021 --> 05:12.852
OKAY, WHAT WOULD I SAY?

05:12.853 --> 05:14.894
OH, I CAN GIVE YOU
THE WORDS FOR THAT.

05:14.895 --> 05:16.397
YOU'VE GOTTA START
OFF BY SAYING...

05:17.988 --> 05:19.610
"NO ONE IS TO BLAME HERE.

05:20.611 --> 05:22.032
ALL RIGHT? WHAT WE HAD...

05:23.203 --> 05:24.494
HONEY, IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

05:24.495 --> 05:26.285
OKAY? BUT LIKE...

05:26.286 --> 05:28.077
LIKE A FLOWER,

05:28.078 --> 05:29.660
IT BLOOMED...

05:32.583 --> 05:34.084
AND THEN IT DIED."

05:35.916 --> 05:37.507
WOW.

05:37.508 --> 05:39.799
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOOD AT MAKING EGGS.
- MMM.

05:39.800 --> 05:43.092
( chuckles ) YOU KNOW, I SHOULD
REALLY BE WRITING THIS DOWN.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.425
ABSOLUTELY. YOU DON'T WANNA MISS
OUT ON ONE NUGGET OF THAT GOLD.

05:45.426 --> 05:46.597
( clears throat )

05:49.309 --> 05:52.682
HELLO THERE, LADIES. HEY, WHAT
DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS, HUH?

05:52.683 --> 05:54.814
DO YOU LIKE THAT CHAPERONE OUTFIT THERE?
DOES THAT SAY FUN KILLER OR WHAT?

05:54.815 --> 05:56.566
MMM, SUPER HOT FUN KILLER.

05:56.567 --> 05:57.857
- ( clicks tongue )
- MMM.

05:57.858 --> 06:01.070
WHOA, WAIT. YOU GUYS ARE
CHAPERONING RYDER'S DANCE?

06:01.071 --> 06:03.362
- DOES HE KNOW ABOUT THIS?
- NO.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.155
WHAT? DUDE, YOU'D BETTER TELL
HIM, GIVE HIM TIME TO PREPARE.

06:06.156 --> 06:08.908
HIS POPULARITY IS
MARGINAL AS IT IS.

06:08.909 --> 06:10.450
I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA
MATTER THAT MUCH.

06:10.451 --> 06:11.751
RYDER'S NOT GONNA BE
GOING TO THAT DANCE.

06:11.752 --> 06:13.162
HE'S HAVING SOME SERIOUS
PROBLEMS WITH HIS GIRL,

06:13.163 --> 06:15.795
SO I TOLD HIM TO... CUT BAIT.

06:15.796 --> 06:18.458
( both gasp )

06:18.459 --> 06:21.501
WHAT? NO NO, I-I... I
DIDN'T SAY IT LIKE THAT.

06:21.502 --> 06:25.925
- I'M A VERY SENSITIVE GUY.
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

06:25.926 --> 06:28.217
YES, I AM. I GAVE HIM SOME
VERY THOUGHTFUL PHRASES...

06:28.218 --> 06:30.430
TIME-TESTED BY ME... THAT
RIGHT NOW HE IS UPSTAIRS

06:30.431 --> 06:32.932
WEAVING INTO A VERY...

06:32.933 --> 06:34.393
THOUGHTFUL, CARING
BREAK-UP SPEECH,

06:34.394 --> 06:35.855
ALL RIGHT? IT'S BEING
HANDLED CORRECTLY.

06:35.856 --> 06:38.898
NO, YOU DON'T BREAK UP WITH A
GIRL 48 HOURS BEFORE A DANCE!

06:38.899 --> 06:40.730
YEAH, I MEAN, SHE ALREADY
BOUGHT HER DRESS...

06:40.731 --> 06:42.231
AND SHOES, AND NO DOUBT
SHE'S PLANNED HER HAIR...

06:42.232 --> 06:44.944
AND MAKE-UP. I MEAN, THIS
IS A HUGE DATING TABOO.

06:44.945 --> 06:48.739
WOMEN TALK... AND HOLD GRUDGES.
TRUST ME.

06:49.870 --> 06:52.331
HEY, JOE, I FINISHED
THAT BREAK-UP SPEECH.

06:52.332 --> 06:54.333
- WANNA TAKE A LOOK?
- NO NO, IT'S... IT'S...

06:54.334 --> 06:56.707
"WHAT WE HAD WAS
LIKE A DEAD FLOWER.

06:57.878 --> 07:01.001
IT BLOOMED AND THEN IT
DIED, LIKE A ROCK."

07:02.252 --> 07:03.713
THIS GUY. ( chuckles )

07:03.714 --> 07:05.925
THE KING OF BREAK-UP ADVICE.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.718
- RYDER, STOP. ( chuckles )
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I'M JUST TELLING IT...

07:08.719 --> 07:10.180
NO NO, SERIOUSLY, DUDE, STOP.

07:14.975 --> 07:18.898
SO LOOK, MAN, WHEN I TOLD YOU
TO BREAK UP WITH STELLA,

07:18.899 --> 07:21.941
WHAT I FORGOT TO MENTION WAS THAT
THERE WERE CERTAIN BLACKOUT DATES

07:21.942 --> 07:25.274
WHEN BREAK-UPS ARE NOT
PERMITTED, OKAY? LIKE...

07:25.275 --> 07:26.526
- VALENTINE'S DAY.
- A GIRL'S BIRTHDAY.

07:26.527 --> 07:28.327
- NEW YEAR'S EVE.
- OH, THAT'S A GOOD ONE,

07:28.328 --> 07:29.699
BECAUSE YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO
HAVE SOMEONE TO KISS AT MIDNIGHT.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.031
OH, OR HALLOWEEN IF YOU'RE
DOING A COUPLES COSTUME.

07:32.032 --> 07:33.994
YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE
GREEN EGGS WITHOUT HAM.

07:35.285 --> 07:36.376
ARE WE DONE, KIM AND KHLOE?

07:38.418 --> 07:40.129
OR BACK TO MY POINT,

07:40.130 --> 07:42.341
TWO DAYS BEFORE A
VERY IMPORTANT DANCE.

07:42.342 --> 07:45.004
SO... YOU'RE TELLING
ME TO HOLD OFF.

07:45.005 --> 07:48.758
AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGMENT, YES.

07:48.759 --> 07:50.930
BUT WON'T IT BE LIKE
I'M LEADING HER ON

07:50.931 --> 07:53.973
IF I TAKE HER TO THE DANCE, WHEN I'M
REALLY JUST GONNA BREAK UP WITH HER LATER?

07:53.974 --> 07:56.976
WH... YEAH, MEL, WON'T IT?

07:56.977 --> 08:00.149
OKAY, LET ME EXPLAIN
THIS TO YOUR BOTH

08:00.150 --> 08:01.521
SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND.

08:01.522 --> 08:03.272
SHE HAS A DRESS, YOU'RE
GOING TO THE DANCE.

08:03.273 --> 08:05.234
CASE CLOSED. OH, AND BY THE WAY,

08:05.235 --> 08:06.445
JOE AND I ARE CHAPERONING.

08:06.446 --> 08:08.778
OKAY, WELL, THIS JUST
GETS BETTER AND BETTER.

08:08.779 --> 08:10.991
- YOU'LL THANK ME SOMEDAY.
- YEAH, I DON'T THINK I WILL.

08:13.614 --> 08:16.746
SO HERE'S A SECOND PAIR OF
PANTS IN CASE SHE NEEDS IT,

08:16.747 --> 08:18.538
WHY? WE'RE NOT GOING OUT.

08:18.539 --> 08:21.791
YEAH, BUT SOME STUFF
INSIDE HER MIGHT.

08:21.792 --> 08:24.253
- EWW. ( scoffs )
- HEY, STELLA,

08:24.254 --> 08:25.965
DID I TELL YOU HOW
NICE YOUR DRESS LOOKS?

08:25.966 --> 08:29.218
UH-HUH. ANYWAY, SO
THERE'S PUREED BANANAS,

08:29.219 --> 08:30.930
SOME OATMEAL

08:30.931 --> 08:32.972
AND TWO BOTTLES OF BREAST MILK.

08:32.973 --> 08:36.266
- THEY'RE STILL WARM.
- YEAH, YOU CAN JUST SET THOSE ON THE TABLE.

08:37.477 --> 08:38.598
SO IF I HAVE TO PICK HER UP,

08:38.599 --> 08:41.310
ARE THERE GLOVES OR
TONGS OR SOMETHING?

08:41.311 --> 08:43.142
( scoffs ) DON'T WORRY, OKAY?

08:43.143 --> 08:45.905
IF SHE GETS FUSSY, TURN
ON THE TWINKLE LIGHT.

08:45.906 --> 08:48.858
SHE LOVES THEM. SO PRESS
THIS BUTTON FOR LIGHTS ONLY,

08:48.859 --> 08:50.409
PRESS THIS ONE FOR MUSIC ONLY

08:50.410 --> 08:53.072
AND HOLD THEM BOTH DOWN
FOR LIGHTS AND MUSIC.

08:53.073 --> 08:54.825
IS THERE A TECH SUPPORT NUMBER?

08:56.326 --> 08:58.537
STELL, DON'T YOU LOOK
ADORABLE IN YOUR DRESS?

08:58.538 --> 09:00.830
IF THERE WAS AN "UNWED
TEEN MOM" MAGAZINE...

09:00.831 --> 09:02.662
WE WOULD REGRET BRINGING THAT UP.
( chuckles )

09:02.663 --> 09:04.253
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO EVERYBODY.

09:04.254 --> 09:07.336
- ALL RIGHT, SHALL WE?
- SURE, WHY NOT?

09:07.337 --> 09:09.048
OH, HANG ON A SECOND.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.549
I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT BABIES,

09:10.550 --> 09:12.632
BUT SHE KINDA FEELS
LIKE A BAKED POTATO.

09:12.633 --> 09:15.805
OH NO. I THOUGHT SHE WAS
OVER THIS EAR THING.

09:15.806 --> 09:18.517
LOOK, I... I CAN'T LEAVE
HER IF SHE'S SICK.

09:18.518 --> 09:20.680
OH, I'M SORRY.

09:20.681 --> 09:22.351
YOU'RE STILL PAYING ME, THOUGH.

09:22.352 --> 09:24.393
- WHAT?
- WELL, THIS WAS HARD.

09:24.394 --> 09:26.315
I ALMOST TOUCHED BREAST MILK.

09:26.316 --> 09:28.778
- AND I ALMOST CARE.
- GOSH, YOU KNOW,

09:28.779 --> 09:30.610
I REALLY WISH THERE WAS
SOMETHING I COULD DO,

09:30.611 --> 09:33.072
BUT THERE ISN'T, SO, LATER.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.324
WAY TO BE A TEAM PLAYER!

09:35.325 --> 09:37.326
WHAT DO WE WANNA DO
ABOUT THE DANCE?

09:37.327 --> 09:39.498
WELL, CLEARLY, I'M
STUCK WITH THE BABY,

09:39.499 --> 09:42.702
SO YOU GO AND POST SOME PICTURES
OF YOURSELF HAVING FUN.

09:42.703 --> 09:45.164
OKAY, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

09:45.165 --> 09:48.337
( mutters ) YOU'RE
NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

09:48.338 --> 09:51.050
YOU KNOW WHAT, STELLA? I JUST HAD
A GREAT IDEA, ALL BY MYSELF.

09:51.051 --> 09:53.172
I THINK I SHOULD STAY HERE.

09:53.173 --> 09:54.553
I'M GONNA STAY HERE WITH YOU.

09:54.554 --> 09:56.556
RYDER, THAT IS SO
THOUGHTFUL OF YOU.

09:58.518 --> 10:00.930
( whispers ) HEY, YOU
GONNA BE ALL RIGHT, MAN?

10:00.931 --> 10:03.022
( whispers ) SICK BABY AND
A GIRLFRIEND WHO HATES ME?

10:03.023 --> 10:04.725
PAR-TAY.

10:06.486 --> 10:09.148
( dance music playing )

10:09.149 --> 10:11.110
NO DRUGS, NO ALCOHOL, NO SEX,

10:11.111 --> 10:14.113
NONE OF THOSE TWERKING
MOVES WITH THEIR BUTTS.

10:14.114 --> 10:17.446
YOU KNOW, WE WERE BOTH HERE
AT 4:00, MAYBE EVEN 3:00.

10:17.447 --> 10:18.738
- ACTUALLY, I THINK IT WAS CLOSER TO 3:00.
- YEAH.

10:18.739 --> 10:21.120
WE ACTUALLY HELPED THE
GUY OPEN UP THE GYM.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.832
I LIKE IT. YOU'RE HUNGRY.

10:22.833 --> 10:25.915
WELL, IF YOU NEED TO REACH ME,
HERE ARE YOUR WALKIE-TALKIES.

10:25.916 --> 10:28.007
WE GET WALKIE-TALKIES?
I LOVE WALKIE-TALKIES.

10:28.008 --> 10:29.338
( chuckles ) ALL
RIGHT, LOOK LOOK LOOK,

10:29.339 --> 10:31.130
I'M GONNA BE EAGLE, YOU BE SWAN.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.133
YOU CAN BE EAGLE AND SWAN.

10:34.384 --> 10:35.925
SERIOUSLY?

10:35.926 --> 10:38.307
WELL, I'M GONNA CHECK THE
PERIMETER, KEEP THE ENEMY GUESSING.

10:38.308 --> 10:39.558
ENEMY? THEY'RE HIGH SCHOOL KIDS.

10:39.559 --> 10:41.601
THEY ARE ANIMALS WITH BACKPACKS.

10:44.975 --> 10:47.266
YOU KNOW, THEY PROBABLY DON'T
EVEN KNOW I'M AN ADULT.

10:47.267 --> 10:49.609
THEY PROBABLY JUST THINK I'M SOME HOT
SENIOR TRANSFER. ( clicks tongue )

10:53.113 --> 10:54.534
YEAH, YOU'RE JUST
LIKE "JUMP STREET."

10:56.616 --> 10:59.538
OKAY, YOU SEE THAT?
THAT'S BOOZE.

10:59.539 --> 11:01.080
WHAT? THEY'RE DRINKING SODAS.

11:01.081 --> 11:02.491
NO NO NO, SODAS FIZZ
WHEN YOU OPEN 'EM UP.

11:02.492 --> 11:04.744
HEY, YOU TWO,
FREEZE RIGHT THERE!

11:04.745 --> 11:06.546
LOOK AT 'EM, THEY'RE TERRIFIED.
THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE FUN.

11:07.918 --> 11:11.340
- OKAY. OKAY, BABY ISABEL.
- ( crying )

11:11.341 --> 11:14.293
LET'S TAKE A TRIP TO
SLEEPYTOWN, OKAY?

11:14.294 --> 11:15.504
WE ARE SO POOPED.

11:15.505 --> 11:18.347
EVERYBODY SLEEPS IN SLEEPYTOWN.

11:18.348 --> 11:21.931
OH, THERE'S RIP VAN WINKLE
AND, OH, SLEEPING BEAUTY,

11:21.932 --> 11:25.394
- AND MITCH RATCLIFF. HE'S IN MY ENGLISH CLASS.
- ( crying stops )

11:25.395 --> 11:26.936
SITS BEHIND ME, SLEEPS
THROUGH EVERY CLASS.

11:26.937 --> 11:28.358
WE SHOOT SPITBALLS AT HIM.

11:29.479 --> 11:31.690
AND...

11:31.691 --> 11:33.312
SHE'S OUT.

11:33.313 --> 11:34.443
( softly ) HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

11:34.444 --> 11:36.195
I MUST'VE WALKED
HER FOR AN HOUR.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.158
AH. IT'S A GIFT, REALLY. I
CAN PUT ANYONE TO SLEEP.

11:39.159 --> 11:40.319
- ( burps )
- ( gasps )

11:40.320 --> 11:42.451
- OH.
- ( laughing )

11:42.452 --> 11:44.324
- SHE GET ME?
- SHE CREAMED YOU.

11:46.957 --> 11:49.588
- OOH!
- OH GREAT.

11:49.589 --> 11:52.211
WELL, ONCE UPON A TIME,
THIS WAS A NICE NEW SUIT.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.214
NOW IT'S A BARF
BAG WITH POCKETS.

11:55.675 --> 11:59.338
OH. LOOK, I DON'T MEAN
TO MAKE FUN OF YOU.

11:59.339 --> 12:01.931
NO NO NO, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S REALLY OKAY.

12:01.932 --> 12:03.432
I HAVEN'T...

12:03.433 --> 12:05.474
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU LAUGH
LIKE THAT IN A LONG TIME.

12:05.475 --> 12:08.397
OH, RYDER, I...

12:08.398 --> 12:11.480
I LOVE MY DAUGHTER, BUT THE WORK

12:11.481 --> 12:13.442
IS JUST ENDLESS.
AND I WAS HOPING

12:13.443 --> 12:15.404
I'D FINALLY GET ONE
NIGHT OF FUN WITH YOU.

12:15.405 --> 12:17.777
- ( scoffs )
- HEY.

12:17.778 --> 12:20.619
HEY, WE COULD STILL HAVE FUN.

12:20.620 --> 12:23.412
WHAT DO THEY HAVE AT THE DANCE
THAT WE DON'T HAVE HERE?

12:23.413 --> 12:25.245
NICE LIGHTING...

12:31.711 --> 12:33.542
A LITTLE MUSIC...

12:33.543 --> 12:35.504
( "This Old Man" playing )

12:35.505 --> 12:39.678
WHAT? SOME DANCING.

12:39.679 --> 12:41.470
( both laugh )

12:41.471 --> 12:45.014
- COME ON, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
- WELL, I MEAN,

12:45.015 --> 12:48.057
HOW CAN I SAY NO TO A
HOT JAM LIKE THIS?

12:48.058 --> 12:49.980
OKAY.

12:55.565 --> 12:57.567
( dance music playing )

13:02.823 --> 13:04.783
HEY, KNOCK IT OFF, WILL YA?

13:04.784 --> 13:07.366
- KNOCK IT OFF.
- WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THAT?

13:07.367 --> 13:09.869
- THEY WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING INAPPROPRIATE.
- THEY WERE DOING THE SUPERMAN.

13:09.870 --> 13:12.001
THAT WAS MORE THAN
FIVE YEARS AGO.

13:12.002 --> 13:13.502
THEY WERE HUMILIATING
THEMSELVES.

13:13.503 --> 13:15.875
ALL RIGHT, EASE UP,
OFFICER LONGO.

13:15.876 --> 13:18.127
- HEY, YOU WANNA DANCE?
- MEL, PLEASE.

13:18.128 --> 13:21.220
- I'M ON DUTY HERE.
- THERE YOU ARE.

13:21.221 --> 13:23.183
- ( chuckles )
- I JUST SAW, UH...

13:24.264 --> 13:26.225
OH, NO NO, IT'S...
IT'S OKAY, MAN.

13:26.226 --> 13:27.977
WE TRUST HER.

13:27.978 --> 13:31.480
OKAY, TWO SENIORS JUST SNUCK
INTO THE COACH'S OFFICE.

13:31.481 --> 13:33.482
- THEY HAD SEX IN THEIR EYES.
- WAY TO GO, MARVIN.

13:33.483 --> 13:34.984
GOOD JOB, MAN. GOOD JOB.

13:34.985 --> 13:36.435
LOOK, I WANT YOU TO DO ONE
MORE PERIMETER SEARCH

13:36.436 --> 13:38.357
AND THEN CHECK THE PARKING LOT.
YOU SEE ANYTHING,

13:38.358 --> 13:40.399
YOU CAN REACH ME ON MY WALKIE.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.403
- COPY THAT, EAGLE.
- WAY TO GO, HAWK. HUH? HAWK.

13:44.534 --> 13:46.495
- YOU HAVE A SNITCH?
- I HAVE THREE.

13:46.496 --> 13:48.537
- ( scoffs )
- COME ON, MEL.

13:48.538 --> 13:50.871
LET'S GO CRUSH SOME TEENAGE
DREAMS, HUH? COME ON.

13:55.545 --> 13:56.835
- ( sighs )
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,

13:56.836 --> 13:59.508
- KICK IT IN?
- WOULDN'T THAT BE GREAT?

13:59.509 --> 14:01.510
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S GO TIME.

14:01.511 --> 14:03.342
( sighs )

14:03.343 --> 14:04.803
( mouths )

14:04.804 --> 14:07.016
ALL RIGHT, CHAPERONES ARE HERE.
ON YOUR FEET.

14:07.017 --> 14:09.178
THAT'S RIGHT, GAME'S OVER, EVERYBODY.
PUT AWAY THE BATS AND THE BALLS.

14:09.179 --> 14:11.230
NOBODY'S GOING TO BE
CROSSING HOME PLATE TONIGHT.

14:11.231 --> 14:13.232
IT WAS DARK AND WE GOT LOST.

14:13.233 --> 14:15.645
OH YEAH? SO NATURALLY YOUR
COMPASS WAS POINTING NORTH.

14:17.067 --> 14:19.028
UH, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TURN US IN, ARE YOU?

14:19.029 --> 14:20.529
DO I LOOK LIKE THAT
TYPE OF PERSON?

14:20.530 --> 14:23.362
I MEAN, I LOOK FUN, HIP
AND HAPPENING. RIGHT?

14:23.363 --> 14:24.743
- SO HAPPENING!
- YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

14:24.744 --> 14:26.365
IS THAT WHAT IT IS? YEAH?
GET OUT OF HERE, ALL RIGHT?

14:26.366 --> 14:29.538
BEFORE WE CHANGE OUR MINDS.
GO ON! SCRAM! BEAT IT!

14:29.539 --> 14:32.371
( chuckles ) YOU'RE NEVER MORE ALIVE
THAN WHEN YOU'RE SCARING PEOPLE.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.453
WHY ARE YOU BEING SO TOUGH
ON A COUPLE OF KIDS?

14:34.454 --> 14:36.625
DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS
LIKE TO BE YOUNG AND FUN?

14:36.626 --> 14:39.878
- HEY, I'M STILL YOUNG AND FUN.
- YEAH, I DON'T SEE IT TONIGHT.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.131
YEAH? YOU WANNA SEE FUN?

14:42.132 --> 14:44.463
- I'LL SHOW YOU FUN.
- ( lock clicks )

14:44.464 --> 14:47.056
- YOU ACTUALLY OWE ME A FAVOR.
- ( scoffs )

14:47.057 --> 14:49.598
I THINK IT MIGHT BE ACTUALLY "FUN"
TO CASH IN ON THAT RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

14:49.599 --> 14:52.061
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING,
LIKE COUCH OR DESK?

14:52.062 --> 14:53.722
OOH, I'M THINKING...

14:53.723 --> 14:55.184
LADY'S CHOICE.

14:55.185 --> 14:58.437
WELL, LADY SAYS... DESK.

14:58.438 --> 15:00.569
- ( mutters ) ALL RIGHT.
- ( clatters )

15:00.570 --> 15:02.861
NOTHING EVER BREAKS WHEN
THEY DO IT IN THE MOVIES.

15:02.862 --> 15:04.364
WHAT ARE YOU...

15:05.525 --> 15:06.906
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

15:09.489 --> 15:12.581
( "The Wheels on
the Bus" playing )

15:12.582 --> 15:17.336
RYDER, I'M SORRY IF I'VE
BEEN KIND OF GRUMPY LATELY.

15:17.337 --> 15:19.878
YOU? NO. NO.

15:19.879 --> 15:22.541
- I... I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE.
- YEAH, YOU DID.

15:22.542 --> 15:25.344
OKAY, YOU DID SEEM
A LITTLE, UH...

15:25.345 --> 15:27.466
- BITCHY?
- YOUR WORD, NOT MINE.

15:27.467 --> 15:29.348
( scoffs )

15:29.349 --> 15:32.682
BUT HEY... WHAT...
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:33.723 --> 15:35.724
DO YOU NOT LIKE ME ANYMORE?

15:35.725 --> 15:38.897
NO. RYDER, IT'S NOT YOU.

15:38.898 --> 15:41.650
IT'S JUST... ( sighs )

15:41.651 --> 15:44.943
MONEY'S TIGHT, MY MOM'S
ALWAYS ON MY CASE

15:44.944 --> 15:49.738
AND ISABEL'S DAD SUDDENLY CAN'T
EVEN LOOK AFTER HER ONE DAY A WEEK.

15:49.739 --> 15:51.660
YOU KNOW, AND I THOUGHT
I COULD TRUST HIM,

15:51.661 --> 15:53.452
BUT I CAN'T. I JUST...

15:53.453 --> 15:55.704
I JUST CAN'T TRUST ANYBODY.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.957
HEY. YOU CAN TRUST ME.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.461
- I'M SORRY TO UNLOAD ALL OF THIS ON YOU.
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.383
- ( sighs )
- HEY, IT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR.

16:04.384 --> 16:07.007
ALL RIGHT? I'M YOUR BOYFRIEND.

16:08.548 --> 16:09.969
( giggles )

16:15.475 --> 16:16.515
( dance music playing )

16:16.516 --> 16:19.768
WELL, THAT WAS VERY SATISFYING.

16:19.769 --> 16:21.480
YES, IT WAS.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.102
I CASHED IN MY CHIT

16:23.103 --> 16:25.564
AND YOU GOT A CHIT, TOO.

16:25.565 --> 16:28.407
YOU KNOW, IT IS GOOD TO CUT
LOOSE EVERY ONE IN A WHILE.

16:28.408 --> 16:29.488
IT CERTAINLY IS.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.740
SO, SHOULD WE SHOW THESE
KIDS HOW WE DO IT?

16:31.741 --> 16:34.533
- WHAT?
- DANCING. I MEANT DANCING.

16:34.534 --> 16:36.206
WE'RE PRETTY GOOD AT THAT, TOO.
COME ON.

16:43.623 --> 16:46.926
( kids cheer )

16:54.554 --> 16:57.397
EAGLE, CHICKEN, COME HERE.
RIGHT NOW.

16:59.439 --> 17:01.400
OKAY, I'VE JUST BEEN INFORMED

17:01.401 --> 17:04.233
THAT COACH HIGGINS' OFFICE HAS
BEEN BROKEN INTO THIS EVENING.

17:04.234 --> 17:06.445
STUDENTS HAVE TOLD ME THEY
WALKED BY THE OFFICE DOOR

17:06.446 --> 17:10.410
AND HEARD ALL MANNER OF ANIMAL
NOISES COMING FROM INSIDE.

17:12.322 --> 17:15.364
- FERAL CATS, MAYBE.
- YEAH, THEY CAN BE VERY NOISY, LIKE...

17:15.365 --> 17:17.367
( screeching )

17:19.459 --> 17:20.789
( clears throat )

17:20.790 --> 17:22.541
I'VE DONE SOME INVESTIGATING

17:22.542 --> 17:25.424
AND I HAVE EVIDENCE OF
THE TWO PERPETRATORS.

17:25.425 --> 17:28.377
LIKE D.N.A. EVIDENCE?

17:28.378 --> 17:31.090
NO, A BROKEN TROPHY.

17:31.091 --> 17:33.512
AND I KNOW WHO'S RESPONSIBLE.

17:33.513 --> 17:34.514
YOU DO?

17:35.805 --> 17:38.557
THOSE TWO DEGENERATES
OVER THERE.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.640
I'M GOING TO MY OFFICE AND I'M
GOING TO CALL THEIR PARENTS.

17:41.641 --> 17:44.183
YOU TWO SUPERVISE
WHILE I'M GONE.

17:44.184 --> 17:46.315
HA! WE TOTALLY GOT AWAY WITH IT.

17:46.316 --> 17:48.357
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? YOU'RE GONNA LET
THOSE TWO POOR KIDS TAKE THE FALL?

17:48.358 --> 17:50.689
ABSOLUTELY. THEY'RE YOUNG.

17:50.690 --> 17:53.071
YOU KNOW, THEY'VE GOT THEIR
WHOLE LIVES AHEAD OF THEM.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.324
WITH EVERYTHING YOU WERE SAYING TO
RYDER ABOUT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY,

17:55.325 --> 17:56.695
- THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GONNA ACT?
- WELL, IT'S DIFFERENT.

17:56.696 --> 17:59.118
- HOW?!
- IT'S ME!

17:59.119 --> 18:02.412
OKAY, FINE. UGH!
INTEGRITY SUCKS.

18:04.294 --> 18:07.586
EXCUSE ME, IF I MAY. THESE AREN'T
THE PEOPLE WHO BROKE THE TROPHY.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.418
- NO?
- NUH-UH.

18:09.419 --> 18:11.630
- WELL, THEN WHO DID?
- UM, YEAH.

18:11.631 --> 18:13.422
ACTUALLY, THE THING IS,

18:13.423 --> 18:15.714
I... AM NOT VERY
PROUD TO ADMIT IT,

18:15.715 --> 18:18.517
BUT IT WAS, UH, US.

18:18.518 --> 18:21.981
- ( mouths )
- KIND OF A LITTLE EAGLE-ON-SWAN ACTION.

18:23.433 --> 18:25.354
- ON THE MAN'S DESK?!
- ( mouths )

18:25.355 --> 18:26.985
HE EATS HIS LUNCH THERE!

18:26.986 --> 18:28.987
OH, I DID GET SOME
SESAME SEEDS ON MY ASS.

18:28.988 --> 18:31.490
YOU TWO ARE THE WORST
CHAPERONES EVER!

18:31.491 --> 18:34.363
YOU WILL NEVER WORK ANOTHER
DANCE AT THIS SCHOOL.

18:34.364 --> 18:37.446
DARN IT! UH, OKAY, WELL,

18:37.447 --> 18:38.787
WE STILL GET OUR HOURS, RIGHT?

18:38.788 --> 18:39.909
I MEAN, WE WERE HERE AT 3:00.

18:41.501 --> 18:42.952
( mouths )

18:44.454 --> 18:46.506
( sighs )

18:47.547 --> 18:49.338
SO THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY'S
TALKING ABOUT.

18:49.339 --> 18:51.800
- ( laughs )
- I GOTTA SAY I AGREE.

18:51.801 --> 18:55.344
THAT'S... THAT IS REALLY,
REALLY SOMETHING.

18:55.345 --> 18:57.516
( laughs ) IT WAS.

18:57.517 --> 18:58.597
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS GREAT?

18:58.598 --> 19:02.141
- TELL ME.
- ISABEL IS STILL ASLEEP.

19:04.184 --> 19:05.815
OH, NOT BAD FOR MY FIRST TIME...

19:07.397 --> 19:09.398
AT... AT PUTTING
ISABEL TO SLEEP.

19:09.399 --> 19:11.190
( both laugh )

19:11.191 --> 19:12.982
I'M THE MAN.

19:17.327 --> 19:20.329
YOU KNOW, STELLA, ANY
TIME YOU WANNA COME BACK,

19:20.330 --> 19:22.331
I'M AVAILABLE.

19:22.332 --> 19:25.083
- AW, YOU'RE SWEET.
- ( chuckles )

19:25.084 --> 19:28.337
AH, MY PHONE'S DEAD. HEY, IS THERE
SOMEPLACE THAT I CAN CHECK MY EMAIL?

19:28.338 --> 19:30.669
UH, YEAH. YEAH, MY COMPUTER'S
ON THE KITCHEN TABLE.

19:30.670 --> 19:31.751
OKAY.

19:33.713 --> 19:35.054
( clears throat )

19:46.476 --> 19:48.437
THAT WAS SOMETHING, HUH?
COME ON.

19:48.438 --> 19:50.809
GETTING CAUGHT BY THE VICE-PRINCIPAL
HAVING SEX IN THE COACH'S OFFICE,

19:50.810 --> 19:53.812
GETTING THROWN OUT OF THE DANCE.
WHAT A NIGHT.

19:53.813 --> 19:55.654
YOU KNOW, THROW IN TWO HOURS
AT THE POLICE STATION,

19:55.655 --> 19:57.276
YOU'VE GOT MY SENIOR PROM.

19:57.277 --> 19:59.197
HEY, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
THE IMPORTANT THING WAS?

19:59.198 --> 20:01.450
YES, WE DID NOT LET THOSE TWO
POOR KIDS TAKE THE FALL.

20:01.451 --> 20:03.742
UH, YEAH, I WAS GONNA SAY
I LOGGED MY 18 HOURS,

20:03.743 --> 20:05.244
BUT WHAT YOU SAID WAS GOOD, TOO.

20:05.245 --> 20:06.495
IT FEELS GOOD TO DO THE
RIGHT THING, RIGHT?

20:06.496 --> 20:08.247
YUP YUP, WE DID THE RIGHT THING,

20:08.248 --> 20:09.998
RYDER DID THE RIGHT THING. IT WAS
A GREAT NIGHT FOR EVERYBODY.

20:09.999 --> 20:12.751
- MM-HMM, SURE WAS.
- WE'RE A DEAD FLOWER?

20:12.752 --> 20:15.133
GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WERE
PLANNING TO BREAK UP WITH ME!

20:15.134 --> 20:16.835
BUT YOU WENT AHEAD AND
SLEPT WITH ME ANYWAY?

20:16.836 --> 20:18.637
NO, I NEVER WANNA SEE YOU AGAIN.

20:18.638 --> 20:20.469
WAIT. NO, STELLA,
STELLA, I CAN EXPLAIN.

20:20.470 --> 20:22.681
PLEASE, I... THAT'S
NOT HOW I FEEL NOW.

20:22.682 --> 20:26.305
- ( grunts )
- OUR... OUR FLOWER IS VERY MUCH ALIVE!

20:26.306 --> 20:28.226
- HEY.
- ( door slams )

20:28.227 --> 20:30.400
- YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT IT?
- ( angrily ) NO.

20:31.441 --> 20:33.021
( mutters ) OH, THANK GOD.

20:33.022 --> 20:34.733
( sighs )

20:34.734 --> 20:36.316
WHAT? HE SAID HE DIDN'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

20:38.157 --> 20:40.028
WHA... ( sighs )

20:40.029 --> 20:42.862
- OH, THIS BEING-A-GOOD-PERSON NEVER ENDS.
- UH-HUH.

20:46.416 --> 20:48.457
RYDER HONEY, IT WAS JUST
A MISUNDERSTANDING.

20:48.458 --> 20:50.038
OH, IT'S PRETTY UNDERSTANDABLE.

20:50.039 --> 20:51.370
IT WAS A DISASTER!

20:51.371 --> 20:52.791
OH, WHAT'D RYDER
SCREW UP THIS TIME?

20:52.792 --> 20:55.133
ACTUALLY, IT WAS SOMETHING
JOE SCREWED UP.

20:55.134 --> 20:57.876
I WAS ASKED TO GIVE
ADVICE, I GAVE ADVICE.

20:57.877 --> 20:59.508
OKAY, WHAT EXACTLY
HAPPENED HERE?

20:59.509 --> 21:01.591
I HAD SEX TONIGHT, LENNOX.

21:02.642 --> 21:04.434
WAS ANYONE ELSE INVOLVED?

21:05.515 --> 21:07.476
WELL, IN A WAY, WE ALL WERE.

21:07.477 --> 21:08.978
YUP.

21:11.851 --> 21:13.942
METAPHORICALLY.

21:13.943 --> 21:15.814
YOU KNOW, I THINK IF THIS
FAMILY SHARED A LITTLE LESS,

21:15.815 --> 21:18.196
WE WOULD BE A LOT HAPPIER.

21:18.197 --> 21:20.360
ALL RIGHT, I'M JUST GONNA
LEAVE YOU GUYS WITH THAT.

21:22.031 --> 21:23.453
OH, YOU STILL OWE ME
A HUNDRED DOLLARS.

21:24.904 --> 21:26.496
OKAY, 50.
