I got to agree with that.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.206

Rad bod, though.

05:41.689 --> 05:43.386

05:44.561 --> 05:46.737
I noticed you ogling

05:46.781 --> 05:48.739
You want me to introduce you?

05:48.783 --> 05:50.915
I don't know what
you're talking about.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.700
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

05:52.743 --> 05:55.006
The whole reason most people
come to Slimmercise class

05:55.050 --> 05:56.225
is to hook up.

05:57.748 --> 05:59.446
Not for me.

05:59.489 --> 06:01.578
The last American virgin.

06:01.622 --> 06:03.537
Everyone tells me I can be

06:03.580 --> 06:05.582
a little over the top
with new people.

06:05.626 --> 06:07.454
It's just that it's L.A.--
you can't make friends

06:07.497 --> 06:08.933
unless you get
a little aggressive, right?

06:08.977 --> 06:10.413
Totally.

06:10.457 --> 06:11.762
I'm Brooke.

06:11.806 --> 06:13.242
I'm new in town.

06:13.285 --> 06:14.461
Well, I'm obsessed
with this place.

06:14.504 --> 06:16.245
I've been doing aerobics
since '82.

06:16.288 --> 06:18.943
Ever since I read those articlesabout it in Rolling Stone.

06:18.987 --> 06:20.380
Did you know they have

06:20.423 --> 06:21.511
competitive aerobics
championships?

06:21.555 --> 06:22.991
-Sounds... serious.

06:23.034 --> 06:24.993
I know it may sound
silly to you,

06:25.036 --> 06:27.778
but I'm gonna be the greatestaerobics competitor of all time.

06:27.822 --> 06:29.780
-I'm Montana, by the way.
-Mm.

06:37.266 --> 06:39.181
She was stabbed, like, 40 times.

06:39.224 --> 06:42.663
Her throat was cut so badly
she was basically decapitated.

06:42.706 --> 06:45.187
-Describing your last date?
- Hilarious.

06:45.230 --> 06:48.408
-Yeah.
-No. There was a murder
a couple of days ago

06:48.451 --> 06:49.713
in Glassell Park.

06:49.757 --> 06:52.063
My cousin works
for LAPD Homicide,

06:52.107 --> 06:54.022
and they're convinced
whoever did it is responsible

06:54.065 --> 06:56.546
for a bunch of other
unsolved murders in town.

06:56.590 --> 06:59.506
The cops are calling him
the Night Stalker.

06:59.549 --> 07:01.421
I heard serial killers
become more active

07:01.464 --> 07:03.074
in the summer months
when it's hot.

07:06.251 --> 07:08.645
Because people sleep with
their windows open at night.

07:08.689 --> 07:10.212
Hmm. This is Brooke.

07:10.255 --> 07:11.561
She's new in town.

07:11.605 --> 07:13.694
Brooke, this is Xavier,

07:13.737 --> 07:15.696
Ray and Chet.

07:15.739 --> 07:17.306
Hi.

07:17.349 --> 07:19.221
Hey.

07:19.264 --> 07:21.571
Hey. How do you guys
know each other?

07:21.615 --> 07:23.007
XAVIER:
Well, it's L.A.

07:23.051 --> 07:24.835
Do any of us really know
each other?

07:24.879 --> 07:27.664
RAY: We collected each other
over the last couple of years.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.231
Xavier and Montana
met in traffic

07:29.274 --> 07:31.015
-and dated for a hot second.
-"Met in traffic"

07:31.059 --> 07:33.235
is a nice way of saying
that I missed an audition

07:33.278 --> 07:34.584
for one of the last episodes
of MASH

07:34.628 --> 07:36.238
because she rear-ended me.

07:36.281 --> 07:37.239
You are welcome.

07:37.282 --> 07:39.067
-You're an actor?
-Yeah.

07:39.110 --> 07:41.504
Not one of those "happy
to get a role on a soap opera

07:41.548 --> 07:43.288
or a Coca-Cola commercial"
types.

07:43.332 --> 07:45.465
I'm a serious actor.

07:45.508 --> 07:47.510
I trained at Stella Adler..

07:47.554 --> 07:49.033
I'm method.

07:49.077 --> 07:50.252
Cool.

07:50.295 --> 07:51.688
Chet and I met at the gym.

07:51.732 --> 07:53.255
Yeah, and I think I met Montana

07:53.298 --> 07:55.518
at a party up in the hills
at Justine Bateman's house.

07:55.562 --> 07:57.085
-You know her?
-Not really.

07:57.128 --> 07:59.479
Anyway... my cousin
was saying that they think

07:59.522 --> 08:01.132
that this guy's
gonna go on a rampage,

08:01.176 --> 08:03.831
like Son of Sam did
in the summer of '78.

08:03.874 --> 08:05.833
Which is why
I'm getting out of town

08:05.876 --> 08:07.312
for the next couple of months.

08:07.356 --> 08:09.532
I got a gig as a counselor
at a summer camp

08:09.576 --> 08:11.534
they're opening up
a couple of hours from here.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.102
You guys should all come.

08:14.145 --> 08:16.060
I mean, they're desperate
for counselors.

08:16.104 --> 08:17.845
Hey, I'm in.
When do we leave?

08:17.888 --> 08:20.325
Tomorrow, after class.

08:20.369 --> 08:21.762
Why can't we leave tonight?

08:21.805 --> 08:23.546
Slow down.

08:23.590 --> 08:24.678
What's with you?

08:24.721 --> 08:26.723
You been jumpy all week.

08:26.767 --> 08:29.639
I'm just ready to get out before
the Olympic shit show starts.

08:29.683 --> 08:32.729
Okay? Los Angelesis about to descend into chaos.

08:32.773 --> 08:34.862
All right,
gridlock on the freeways.

08:34.905 --> 08:36.646
And I'm thinking of poor Chet,
having to be here

08:36.690 --> 08:38.518
getting his face rubbed in it.

08:38.561 --> 08:40.302
Fuck the IOC.

08:40.345 --> 08:42.652
I'm in.

08:42.696 --> 08:44.741
Do you think they'd let me
teach aerobics up there?

08:44.785 --> 08:46.743
Can't see why not.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.832
I'm in.

08:48.876 --> 08:50.355
You should come.

08:50.399 --> 08:52.183
I'm desperate for some estrogen
in this crew.

08:52.227 --> 08:54.838
Oh. Sounds fun,

08:54.882 --> 08:57.972
but I'm taking classes
at Santa Monica College.

08:58.015 --> 09:00.104
I'm gonna be
a veterinary assistant.

09:00.148 --> 09:02.324

14:51.064 --> 14:53.327
Yeah, yeah.
How much do we owe you?

14:53.370 --> 14:55.720
Ten even.

15:05.774 --> 15:06.906
You're all gonna die.

15:23.226 --> 15:25.359
♪ I'm outta luck♪

15:25.402 --> 15:27.143
♪ Outta love...♪

15:27.187 --> 15:29.058
You guys, I think we were
supposed to turn back there.

15:29.102 --> 15:30.755
Nah, that was a side road.

15:30.799 --> 15:32.235
Leads to the same place.

15:32.279 --> 15:34.194
This way is much faster.

15:34.237 --> 15:35.151
You've never been here before.

15:35.195 --> 15:37.197
-How do you know?
-Instincts, baby.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.763
Maybe we should have checked
at the gas station.

15:38.807 --> 15:41.070
BROOKE:
Why was that guy saying

15:41.114 --> 15:43.203
all of that creepy st...
Look out!

15:52.386 --> 15:54.127
Did we hit him?

15:55.563 --> 15:57.739
No. I-I don't think so.

15:57.782 --> 15:59.349
Hey.

15:59.393 --> 16:01.134
You okay?

16:02.135 --> 16:03.310
Just keep your head back
and relax.

16:03.353 --> 16:05.094
We need to keep him warm.

16:05.138 --> 16:07.140
I-I'll go get a blanket.

16:07.183 --> 16:08.619
What's your name?

16:09.664 --> 16:11.274
I can't remember.

16:11.318 --> 16:13.537
-CHET: No, no, no, no, no, no!

16:13.581 --> 16:16.192
-Don't move.
-XAVIER: No...

16:16.236 --> 16:17.324
Look-look at his cuts.

16:17.367 --> 16:19.543
The dried blood.
He didn't just get

16:19.587 --> 16:21.763
those injuries--he's been out here a long time.

16:21.806 --> 16:24.200
Doesn't matter.We're in the middle of nowhere.

16:24.244 --> 16:26.289
We can't just leave him here.

16:26.333 --> 16:28.552
XAVIER:We'll take him back to the campwith us, then, but

16:28.596 --> 16:30.815
let's get our stories straight.We didn't hit him.

16:32.861 --> 16:34.602
Here, let's just
get him up, huh?

16:36.082 --> 16:37.126
Let's get him up.

16:38.171 --> 16:39.346
You got to believe me.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.348
-I tried.
-BROOKE: It's okay.

16:41.391 --> 16:43.393
Okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

16:49.051 --> 16:50.052
RAY:
Hey.

16:50.096 --> 16:52.054
Hey!

17:18.385 --> 17:19.821
Welcome to Camp Redwood.

17:19.864 --> 17:21.823
I'm Margaret Booth.
I'm the owner.

17:21.866 --> 17:24.826
Boss lady chopping
her own wood. Choice.

17:24.869 --> 17:26.262
Well, we'll all have to wear
multiple hats.

17:26.306 --> 17:28.830
We are short-staffed, andthe kids arrive in the morning.

17:28.873 --> 17:30.397
Yeah, are we
the only counselors?

17:30.440 --> 17:33.139
Well, the Olympics create
thousands of temporary jobs,

17:33.182 --> 17:35.358
and my pool of potential
employees was limited.

17:35.402 --> 17:37.099
Is there a medic
or a nurse here?

17:38.231 --> 17:40.929
We have a situation.

17:40.972 --> 17:42.844
What happened to him?

17:42.887 --> 17:44.237
XAVIER:
Uh, he was by the side
of the road.

17:45.673 --> 17:47.109
-He was already messed up.
-Okay, well,

17:47.153 --> 17:48.284
let's get him to the infirmary.

17:56.205 --> 17:58.251
You say you found him
in the middle of the road?

17:58.294 --> 18:00.079
He was by the side of the road.

18:00.122 --> 18:03.082
He's been pretty out of it,
saying weird things,

18:03.125 --> 18:04.648
not making much sense.

18:04.692 --> 18:07.303
He's severely dehydrated.

18:07.347 --> 18:09.523
Probably went for a hike
and got lost.

18:09.566 --> 18:12.656
Couldn't find his way back.
Panicked.

18:12.700 --> 18:16.225
People don't realize
just how deep these woods are.

18:16.269 --> 18:19.141
Hikers get lost in them
every year.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.274
End up dead of hypothermia or

18:21.317 --> 18:22.884
falling into a ravine

18:22.927 --> 18:25.321
or just disappearing altogether.

18:25.365 --> 18:27.236
He's lucky you found him.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.324
Hmm.

18:28.368 --> 18:29.238
Is he gonna die?

18:29.282 --> 18:31.458
Not on my watch.

18:31.501 --> 18:34.461
Don't worry, I work in the E.R.at Hawthorne Hospital

18:34.504 --> 18:36.419
-the rest of the year.
-MARGARET: Why don't we

18:36.463 --> 18:37.768
give our nurse a little space.

18:37.812 --> 18:40.380
Come on. I can show you all
a tour of the camp.

18:43.948 --> 18:45.950
We have canoes and rowboats.

18:45.994 --> 18:48.257
All children must have a buddy
to go into the water.

18:48.301 --> 18:51.130
The lake is
allegedly bottomless,

18:51.173 --> 18:53.915
and drowning is the number onecause of death for U.S. campers.

18:53.958 --> 18:54.959
What's second?

19:06.188 --> 19:08.756
And this is Chef Bertie,

19:08.799 --> 19:10.366
a Camp Redwood veteran.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.020
Dibs.

19:12.063 --> 19:13.282
You wouldn't know
what to do with it

19:13.326 --> 19:14.588
if you got it, handsome.

19:16.633 --> 19:18.374
Put those scrawny arms to work

19:18.418 --> 19:20.376
and help a lady fill her pantry.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.378
All of you, grab a crate.

19:22.422 --> 19:24.293
This heat is a killer.

19:24.337 --> 19:26.730
MARGARET:
Chef Bertie worked here
when I was a counselor.

19:26.774 --> 19:29.298
We are so blessed
to have her with us.

19:29.342 --> 19:32.432
I have many good memories
of this place.

19:32.475 --> 19:34.825
It's magic up here
in the fresh air.

19:36.610 --> 19:39.961
I'm sorry that one bad apple
ruined it for everyone.

19:40.004 --> 19:42.964
The minute I heard Margaret
was reopening this place,

19:43.007 --> 19:45.053
I was first to volunteer.

19:45.096 --> 19:48.404
No. No, no, no, this... all thisgoes up to the mess hall.

19:48.448 --> 19:51.190
MARGARET:
Girls shower in the a.m.,
boys in the p.m.

19:51.233 --> 19:53.757
Same goes for counselors, too.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.585
This is the girls' cabin.

20:00.808 --> 20:02.418
And this is the boys' cabin.

20:02.462 --> 20:03.550
Girls are red.

20:03.593 --> 20:05.029
Boys are blue.

20:05.073 --> 20:06.640
Don't even try to make purple.

20:07.684 --> 20:09.338
You expect us to be celibate
all summer?

20:09.382 --> 20:11.340
Well, I'm not
banning self-abuse.

20:11.384 --> 20:13.081
Although every stroke
soils your soul.

20:13.124 --> 20:14.648
But how could I ever enforce it?

20:14.691 --> 20:17.085
It's 1984, Margaret.

20:17.128 --> 20:19.566
They're building coed showers
in the West Hollywood gym.

20:19.609 --> 20:22.264
You ever hear
of the sexual revolution?

20:22.308 --> 20:24.266
Sex won.

20:24.310 --> 20:27.313
I am aware of the decadence
of our era.

20:27.356 --> 20:29.402
Women's underwear
that shows the buttocks.

20:29.445 --> 20:32.448
Pornography in your own home.

20:32.492 --> 20:33.580
Van Halen.

20:33.623 --> 20:36.278
I have been fighting
the Lord's fight

20:36.322 --> 20:38.672
against filth around the world
for years.

20:38.715 --> 20:40.674
Charles Keating
is a dear friend.

20:40.717 --> 20:42.676
I was right by his side
in Cincinnati

20:42.719 --> 20:44.417
during that Larry Flynt trial.

20:44.460 --> 20:47.246
And that is why,
while still grieving

20:47.289 --> 20:50.336
my sweet husband Walter's
untimely death,

20:50.379 --> 20:53.600
I took a small portion
of the large fortune

20:53.643 --> 20:56.429
he left to me to buy this camp
and create a safe,

20:56.472 --> 21:00.476
pure, godly and decent place

21:00.520 --> 21:04.045
for the children of this countryto escape for the summer.

21:04.088 --> 21:07.483
It is a dream come true.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.833
Now, there aren't many rules,
but I expect every one of you

21:09.877 --> 21:11.922
to follow them
without exception.

21:14.882 --> 21:16.492
Who's Charles Keating?

21:42.126 --> 21:44.520
I don't smoke that funny weed.

21:44.564 --> 21:48.132
Only thing I put in my lungs...

21:48.176 --> 21:49.525
is a Marlboro Red.

21:49.569 --> 21:51.397
You know that shit
will kill you.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.094
All got to die somehow.

21:53.137 --> 21:56.097
Any of you been
camp counselors before?

21:56.140 --> 21:57.098
-BROOKE: Mm-mmm.
-CHET: No.

21:57.141 --> 21:58.186
Nah. We just
had to get out of L.A.

21:58.229 --> 21:59.187
RITA:
I hear that.

21:59.230 --> 22:01.102
Couldn't stand
being in that city

22:01.145 --> 22:03.452
another minute. Not with
all those gruesome murders

22:03.496 --> 22:05.149
happening so close to home.

22:05.193 --> 22:07.326
I was attacked in my apartment

22:07.369 --> 22:09.371
by the Night Stalker.

22:10.372 --> 22:12.722
He said he'd come after me.

22:12.766 --> 22:14.550
Brooke, take a chill pill.

22:14.594 --> 22:16.683
He doesn't know where you are,
and nobody followed us.

22:16.726 --> 22:18.598
Nothing bad
is gonna happen here.

22:18.641 --> 22:21.601
RITA:
Maybe not, but something did.

22:22.515 --> 22:24.168
14 years ago.

22:24.212 --> 22:26.214
That's why they
closed this place down.

22:26.257 --> 22:28.999
Rita. I totally understand
the tradition,

22:29.043 --> 22:31.001
and usually
I'm cool with that,

22:31.045 --> 22:33.177
but our friend Brooke here

22:33.221 --> 22:35.223
had a for-real assault, and

22:35.266 --> 22:37.660
we're just not in the mood
for a bullshit ghost story.

22:37.704 --> 22:38.922
It's not bullshit.

22:38.966 --> 22:41.011
And there was no ghost.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.406
I'll be honest with you.
I've never been a nurse

22:44.450 --> 22:45.581
at a summer camp before.

22:45.625 --> 22:48.018
And you've never
been counselors.

22:48.062 --> 22:50.151
So how did we get these jobs

22:50.194 --> 22:52.719
with no prior experience?

22:52.762 --> 22:54.938
That's because anybody
that knows anything

22:54.982 --> 22:56.462
about Camp Redwood

22:56.505 --> 22:58.812
doesn't want
to be in Camp Redwood.

23:01.292 --> 23:03.382
This is the sight of
the worst summer camp massacre

23:03.425 --> 23:04.513
of all time.

23:04.557 --> 23:06.602
Come on, Rita.

23:06.646 --> 23:08.517
His name was Benjamin Richter.

23:08.561 --> 23:11.215
But everybody called him
Mr. Jingles.

23:13.479 --> 23:15.959
Richter was drafted
into the Vietnam War.

23:16.003 --> 23:18.701
They sent him off to Saigon,

23:18.745 --> 23:21.095
and that's where he found
his calling.

23:23.271 --> 23:25.795
He had the highest kill rate
in his company.

23:25.839 --> 23:28.972
And even after he was wounded,

23:29.016 --> 23:31.018
he went back for a second tour.

23:31.061 --> 23:32.759
See, he liked to kill,

23:32.802 --> 23:34.413
and he was good at it.

23:35.544 --> 23:37.459
He had a nasty habit

23:37.503 --> 23:40.462
of collecting trophies
from his enemies.

23:40.506 --> 23:42.464
Cut off their ears

23:42.508 --> 23:44.510
and strung them into a necklace.

23:44.553 --> 23:46.729
Army found out about it

23:46.773 --> 23:48.731
and gave him
a dishonorable discharge.

23:48.775 --> 23:50.254
Richter came home to nothing.

23:50.298 --> 23:52.300
Only job he was able to get...

23:52.343 --> 23:54.650
was right here in Camp Redwood.

23:54.694 --> 23:57.653
Nobody knows
exactly why he snapped.

23:57.697 --> 24:00.090
But one random night,

24:00.134 --> 24:02.528
Mr. Jingles grabs a knife

24:02.571 --> 24:04.660
and slaughters an entire cabin.

24:06.140 --> 24:07.620
Ten victims in all.

24:07.663 --> 24:09.317
MARGARET:
You're wrong.

24:09.360 --> 24:12.668
If you're gonna tell a story,
tell it right.

24:12.712 --> 24:15.062
Alcohol is not allowed.

24:15.105 --> 24:17.673
-Wha... God!
-Neither are those
funny-smelling cigarettes.

24:17.717 --> 24:18.848
What are those, cloves?

24:18.892 --> 24:21.068
So nothing happened here?

24:21.111 --> 24:22.635
No, there was a massacre.

24:22.678 --> 24:24.811
But only nine died, not ten.

24:24.854 --> 24:27.466
So Mr. Jingles is real?

24:32.732 --> 24:35.038
Now, I don't usually show off,

24:35.082 --> 24:37.911
but since you allare helping me start this camp,

24:37.954 --> 24:40.304
I think you deserve
to know everything.

24:45.309 --> 24:47.137
I was asleep when I heard it.

24:48.617 --> 24:50.053
-It was the sound

24:50.097 --> 24:52.839
of his keys... jingling.

24:52.882 --> 24:54.710
I opened my eyes

24:54.754 --> 24:56.625
a split-second
before I felt the blade.

24:56.669 --> 24:58.279
-But I knew

24:58.322 --> 25:00.629
I was going to die.

25:03.327 --> 25:06.548
But then a miracle happened.

25:10.421 --> 25:12.380
I saw a bubble

25:12.423 --> 25:14.382
rising to the surface,

25:14.425 --> 25:16.863
and I had this powerful urge

25:16.906 --> 25:19.953
to follow it up to the light.

25:19.996 --> 25:22.346
I was so scared.

25:22.390 --> 25:24.958
I didn't know how
I could stay still.

25:25.001 --> 25:28.701
But then the light
became so bright.

25:28.744 --> 25:30.964
I was lost in it,

25:31.007 --> 25:34.924
in the warmth and peace.

25:34.968 --> 25:37.666
It was Jesus.

25:37.710 --> 25:39.929
I had known him my whole life,

25:39.973 --> 25:42.366
-but I truly met him that day.

25:42.410 --> 25:44.760
I floated out of my body,

25:44.804 --> 25:48.155
held aloft
by the wings of an angel.

25:48.198 --> 25:50.636
From above, I saw him cut off

25:50.679 --> 25:53.334
my ear, but I gave him nothing.

25:53.377 --> 25:56.337
Not a twitch or a sound.

25:56.380 --> 25:59.340
And that's how
I managed to survive,

25:59.383 --> 26:01.124
through the grace of God

26:01.168 --> 26:03.170
and His mercy.

26:09.916 --> 26:11.831
What happened to Mr. Jingles?

26:11.874 --> 26:13.441
He was arrested
and put on trial.

26:13.484 --> 26:16.357
I was the star witness.

26:16.400 --> 26:19.403
The jury only took an hour
to find him guilty,

26:19.447 --> 26:22.058
and I thought,
"That will be the end of it."

26:24.234 --> 26:26.193
But I can't escape him.

26:26.236 --> 26:27.977
And that's why

26:28.021 --> 26:29.979
I bought this camp.

26:30.023 --> 26:31.981
To reopen it.

26:32.025 --> 26:34.984
And to take all
of my darkest memories

26:35.028 --> 26:38.422
and turn theminto something bright and happy.

26:38.466 --> 26:40.773
Dude.

26:40.816 --> 26:42.731
That's heavy.

26:42.775 --> 26:44.994
Okay, well...

26:45.038 --> 26:47.257
the kids are coming tomorrow,

26:47.301 --> 26:49.216
and this is the last time

26:49.259 --> 26:52.611
I want anyone talking
about that horrible night.

28:16.390 --> 28:18.697
Oh, Jesus.

28:18.740 --> 28:21.700
You can't creep up on people
like that.

28:21.743 --> 28:23.745
You...

28:23.789 --> 28:25.791
you shouldn't be here.

28:25.834 --> 28:27.096
I was worried about you.

28:29.185 --> 28:31.144
What are you doing out of bed?

28:31.187 --> 28:34.016
Come on, you should be resting.

28:36.062 --> 28:39.021
Man, you don't look so good.

28:39.065 --> 28:41.023
There's nobody I can call?

28:41.067 --> 28:44.026
F-Family, friends?

28:44.070 --> 28:46.028
Phone lines are down.

28:46.072 --> 28:47.551
Seriously?

28:47.595 --> 28:50.163
It's a miraclethey let them reopen this dump.

28:50.206 --> 28:51.860
Reopen?

28:53.601 --> 28:54.950
Where are we?

28:54.994 --> 28:57.083
It's a summer camp.
Camp Redwood?

28:57.126 --> 28:59.041
-No.

28:59.085 --> 29:00.956
No, you have to leave.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.176
Something terrible
is gonna happen.

29:03.219 --> 29:04.133
No, I don't understand.
What...

29:04.177 --> 29:06.440
Get out! Go, now!

29:08.137 --> 29:10.052
BROOKE: I think there's something wrong with the hiker.

29:10.096 --> 29:13.142
When I went to check on him,
he wigged out.

29:13.186 --> 29:14.970
I think he has a concussion.

29:15.014 --> 29:17.146
MONTANA:
I mean, we got him here,
made sure

29:17.190 --> 29:18.147
he didn't die.

29:18.191 --> 29:20.106
Karmically, we're cool.

29:20.149 --> 29:21.542
He kept saying something bad

29:21.585 --> 29:23.979
-is gonna happen.

30:42.449 --> 30:45.017
We shot the original
for two days.

30:45.060 --> 30:47.062
But when they tested it
with an audience,

I was pulling focus from Jane.

-How is he?

45:16.322 --> 45:19.281
I guess he was
well enough to leave.

45:19.325 --> 45:21.849
Okay, good. That's one less
person for us to look after.

46:18.601 --> 46:19.951
Why are you sleeping
with a knife?

46:19.994 --> 46:21.604
I have a suspicious nature.

46:21.648 --> 46:22.954
Why are you waking me up?

46:22.997 --> 46:25.043
Someone's calling the pay phone.

46:25.086 --> 46:26.174
Who gives a shit?

46:26.218 --> 46:28.046
He said
the phone lines were down.

46:28.089 --> 46:30.048
Whatever, Brooke.

47:11.263 --> 47:12.917
Hello?

47:16.485 --> 47:17.878
Who is this?

47:24.015 --> 47:26.017
MAN :
Satan, Satan, Satan.
