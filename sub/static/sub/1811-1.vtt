00:13.982 --> 00:16.097
- Go.
- Beverly Hills.

00:17.996 --> 00:19.463
This place sucks.

00:19.557 --> 00:22.504
You think it sucks now?
You should have seen it before the quake.

00:31.055 --> 00:32.164
Is that your contact?

00:34.012 --> 00:36.551
- Damn it. Copy.
- This is Hammond.

00:36.671 --> 00:39.104
What the hell are you doing in the Zone?
No, don't answer that.

00:39.139 --> 00:40.728
You got some action coming your way.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.473
Yeah, what kind of action?

00:42.777 --> 00:43.970
It's Dext Muldoon.

00:45.983 --> 00:47.224
You want to take me now or later.

00:48.050 --> 00:49.457
He's in around the dispensary.

00:49.495 --> 00:52.181
We manage to track his vehicle.
We'll be there in 2 minutes.

00:52.895 --> 00:53.643
Be where?

00:53.685 --> 00:55.549
Aye, this guy is just right
where you're standing.

01:04.605 --> 01:05.552
Go!

01:33.445 --> 01:34.915
- Go after Dext!
- Copy.

02:01.492 --> 02:02.835
Central is a quarantine boundary.

02:03.504 --> 02:05.369
Gimme the melard.
Give the overwrite code.

02:09.901 --> 02:10.895
Shut it down.

02:13.247 --> 02:13.975
Got it.

02:22.127 --> 02:25.651
Huh, huh, huh, huh.

02:25.686 --> 02:26.816
What's so funny asshole?

02:26.920 --> 02:27.876
You're dead.

02:50.859 --> 02:53.075
How many of you officers
have been in this zone before?

02:57.335 --> 02:59.469
That's what I thought.
Rookies.

02:59.955 --> 03:02.646
Yeah, it's about time the rookies
busted good cherries in this zone.

03:03.406 --> 03:05.502
Except for you Hammond,
you don't have a cherry.

03:07.072 --> 03:10.259
We're heading into Level 3.
So I have Level 3 protection.

03:10.759 --> 03:14.090
We have counters and breathers on standby.
I don't think we'll be needing em.

03:14.146 --> 03:15.401
Why are they radioactive?

03:15.436 --> 03:18.855
Well the quake took out 3 local
power stations. Fusion reactors.

03:18.890 --> 03:22.166
Fortunately there wasn't a full meltdown.
But they did release some of the bad stuff.

03:22.231 --> 03:23.639
Who the hell would want to live there?

03:23.825 --> 03:27.080
Do the math.
It's like Club Med for criminals.

03:27.245 --> 03:29.428
Some of the people there
don't have a choice.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.287
Entering the dead zone, Sir.

03:32.368 --> 03:35.484
When we hit the ground,
the target is Dexts Muldoon.

03:36.093 --> 03:38.412
The locals consider him to
be some kind of Che Guevara.

03:39.004 --> 03:41.388
Do not be fooled.
Take him out.

03:41.730 --> 03:44.117
You take out a one-fifth
of the drug trading zone.

03:44.627 --> 03:46.219
Two minutes landing, Sir.

03:50.399 --> 03:51.423
Let's buck it up.

04:11.306 --> 04:14.505
Check the cameras.
Jones, you're good.

04:14.435 --> 04:16.329
Poschek, good.

04:16.410 --> 04:17.870
Jackson, good.

04:17.959 --> 04:20.300
Hammond!  Hammond,
you're not transmitting.

04:20.390 --> 04:21.778
Need another, Sarge.

04:25.560 --> 04:28.463
Little easier to transmit
and I've got a camera, Sarge.

04:30.465 --> 04:33.682
Right.
Hammond you're good.

04:35.536 --> 04:38.106
- Looks like we got company.
- Really small fry though.

04:38.195 --> 04:39.295
We'll take care of them.

04:40.926 --> 04:44.140
Gentlemen, start your countdown.

04:51.081 --> 04:53.428
- Yes sir. This is it.
- Let's go.

05:11.434 --> 05:13.122
Too exposed.
We're going through.

05:43.501 --> 05:44.555
What's wrong with her?

05:44.847 --> 05:47.276
She's got ..ginmars..
Radiation poisoning.

05:47.547 --> 05:51.007
Stay too long in the zone,
it can get pretty nasty.

05:51.940 --> 05:54.405
You already had all your kids, right?

05:57.759 --> 05:58.490
<i>Jones</i>

05:58.493 --> 06:00.526
- That ain't him.
- Keep moving.

06:01.433 --> 06:02.850
That is not our objective.

06:04.476 --> 06:06.276
Woh, woh, woh, woh.
Back up.

06:08.874 --> 06:10.169
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

06:13.181 --> 06:15.852
Uh, uh, go on sit down, big fella.
We ain't here for you.

06:15.752 --> 06:19.470
You wouldn't have set up your command
centre a few blocks away if you were.

06:19.471 --> 06:20.878
Think we didn't see you.

06:20.913 --> 06:26.910
Look, we don't care about your business,
alright.  We just want safe passage.

06:26.945 --> 06:29.674
You have no authority here.

06:33.111 --> 06:35.105
- What do you want?
- Come again.

06:35.486 --> 06:37.846
You need anything?
Medical supplies?

06:38.370 --> 06:43.102
If there's something from the outside world
that you need, I can get it delivered to you.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.393
- Mills?
- You copy me sir.

06:46.528 --> 06:47.556
Good.

06:47.557 --> 06:50.117
So if you need anything,
have one of your man

06:50.118 --> 06:53.081
contact Sergeant Mills down
at the Command Centre.

06:53.094 --> 06:56.250
And if it's something we
can get, he'll get it for you.

06:56.511 --> 06:57.923
You have my word.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.903
All we ask, is to
pass through quietly.

07:01.378 --> 07:03.226
And what if I don't agree?

07:06.017 --> 07:08.220
- Dammit Hammond! Nicoles call for backup.
- Yes sir.

07:08.537 --> 07:11.073
What if what I want
isn't actually legal?

07:11.826 --> 07:12.970
Go on.

07:13.202 --> 07:16.182
Something from your
evidence room, perhaps.

07:16.840 --> 07:20.588
Come on man.
Do we look like crooked cops to you?

07:20.696 --> 07:22.010
Don't answer that.

07:22.388 --> 07:28.080
Iodine tablets, liquid form too. Cypro,
scotch two cases, hypodermic needles,

07:28.815 --> 07:32.582
entry cases of Mexican, Coca Cola.

07:32.873 --> 07:35.158
- The kind with the real sugar?
- Huh, huh, huh.

07:35.175 --> 07:37.409
I can't get my hands on that ...
I mean we can't ...

07:37.818 --> 07:39.481
That was my joke.

07:43.125 --> 07:45.104
- Mills you got that?
- Got it!

07:45.248 --> 07:47.275
Sir, you still need that backup?

07:47.276 --> 07:49.913
Yeah, they're not
even in the building yet.

07:49.661 --> 07:52.411
- We got a deal.
- Good.

08:25.559 --> 08:26.461
Freeze!

08:44.068 --> 08:46.030
Alright, let's papparazi that bitch.

09:06.171 --> 09:09.196
Muldoon, this is the police.

09:09.720 --> 09:12.389
We know you're in there and
we have the place surrounded.

09:21.388 --> 09:25.682
- Mills, see anything?
- Yeah, an ........ woman.

09:27.186 --> 09:28.282
Searching.

09:40.127 --> 09:41.245
Over there!

10:01.340 --> 10:03.004
Damn it Jones.
Report!

10:40.227 --> 10:42.637
Police.
See your hands.

10:43.290 --> 10:45.356
I want you to come out.

10:46.125 --> 10:48.053
Come on. Let's go.
Move, move, move, move.

10:52.357 --> 10:54.333
Out.
Move.

11:47.124 --> 11:50.638
I'd like to do it all, baby.
Remember that.

12:28.390 --> 12:29.677
Oh shit!.

12:29.939 --> 12:31.909
Hammond's gone lone wolf again.

12:43.089 --> 12:45.878
Damn it.
You gotta wait for back up.

13:06.114 --> 13:07.710
You called for back up.

13:19.604 --> 13:20.263
Thank you.

13:42.369 --> 13:43.345
You're dead.

13:48.258 --> 13:51.498
How the hell did you ...?
Doesn't matter.

13:51.543 --> 13:54.539
You have 2 dead cops on your hands.
Do you really want that?

13:55.264 --> 13:57.603
You're in no position to negotiate.

13:58.486 --> 14:00.338
Who said this is a negotiation.

14:00.711 --> 14:02.707
Put down your weapon.

14:07.465 --> 14:09.874
What you gonna do?
You gonna blow both of us up?

14:09.860 --> 14:12.256
Dexts Muldoon, you are under arrest.

14:13.376 --> 14:16.224
You come any closer
and I'll blow his brains out.

14:16.459 --> 14:18.692
Sir, your handheld has been
approved for destruction.

14:19.164 --> 14:21.939
This is not negotiable.
Put down your weapon.

14:22.156 --> 14:25.019
- Who the hell is this guy?
- I have no idea.

14:25.177 --> 14:28.337
You have 3 choices.
Surrender and live.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.330
Shoot Sergeant Hammond and die.

14:30.361 --> 14:33.033
Shoot me and die.
Make a choice.

14:34.756 --> 14:35.756
Fuck you!

14:40.294 --> 14:42.034
Marks, Jackson on me!

14:55.184 --> 14:56.420
Now, what the hell was that?

14:56.421 --> 14:59.257
Did you not see me
pointing the gun at him?

14:59.321 --> 15:01.485
What were you doing?
You almost killed me.

15:01.634 --> 15:02.397
Negative. 

15:02.398 --> 15:06.814
There is a 73% probability that this
individual would had terminated you

15:06.815 --> 15:08.104
if I had not interceded.

15:08.328 --> 15:10.479
Interceding.
You call that interceding.

15:10.499 --> 15:13.119
If I had not interjected you would
have been destroyed, Sergeant Hammond.

15:13.126 --> 15:18.153
Oh, would I.  Ok.  Let's see how you like
a grenade blowing up over your head.

15:22.081 --> 15:25.381
He had this on him.
He had a concealed weapon.

15:30.787 --> 15:34.210
Did anybody frisk him?
God damn it.

15:43.614 --> 15:47.419
- You scanned him, right?
- I followed all operational procedures.

15:47.461 --> 15:49.460
Yeah, but you followed them loosely.

15:49.479 --> 15:52.036
Would you like to file
a complaint, Sergeant?

15:52.070 --> 15:54.796
Well, if it is in the form of
punch you in the face, then, yeah.

15:54.847 --> 15:56.788
I would advise against it.

15:57.194 --> 15:59.480
Yeah, I bet you would Mr. Roboto.

15:59.650 --> 16:01.378
One more thing.
Who sent you?

16:01.406 --> 16:05.439
I received a request for back up.
I provided back up.

16:12.667 --> 16:15.867
- What the hell was that?
- Our future.

16:17.168 --> 16:20.068
Well, the professionals finally
showed up. How about that?

16:20.087 --> 16:22.857
- Oh, you're in this. Over here.
- Thank you.

16:23.304 --> 16:25.608
- Hey, that's not for you.
- The hell it ain't.

16:25.718 --> 16:30.748
- I made a deal.
- Well, sometimes life ain't always fair.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.435
Tell me we're not in
the wrong run of business.

16:33.921 --> 16:35.487
It's not just wrong.

16:42.010 --> 16:47.313
Chief! Chief!
I'd like to report an incident.

16:47.384 --> 16:49.542
Hammond.
I heard all about it.

16:49.567 --> 16:52.814
No, I'm not talking about the suspect.
I'm talking about that supercop.

16:52.815 --> 16:55.471
- Supercop?
- Yeah, you know the guy I'm talking about.

16:55.558 --> 17:00.650
That skin job. That psychopatic soda
machine. That things of men ...

17:00.692 --> 17:05.741
Hammond, before you go too far,
I want you to meet your new partner.

17:12.692 --> 17:14.337
Will you give us a minute?

17:15.756 --> 17:18.116
That means, move out of the way.

17:25.088 --> 17:28.300
I know you don't like it, Hammond,
but you're the best man for it.

17:29.267 --> 17:32.174
Well, assuming I've forgotten
about today's nifty events,

17:32.347 --> 17:33.895
after what happened out
there with that autogun

17:33.896 --> 17:37.657
do you think I'd be happy to take
a position anywhere near a machine.

17:38.062 --> 17:39.048
It's an android.

17:39.049 --> 17:41.085
Well, I don't care what you call it.
It's still a machine.

17:41.086 --> 17:44.165
You know how you sound when
you say you don't like machines?

17:44.427 --> 17:46.890
Look.
Somebody programmed that thing.

17:46.940 --> 17:49.690
Just like somebody programmed
that autogun to stop intruders,

17:49.712 --> 17:54.451
yet it missed our call sign, a secure
call sign. And they call it a malfunction.

17:54.452 --> 17:56.862
A god damn hiccup.
That was a human life.

17:57.016 --> 17:58.174
I know.

17:59.019 --> 18:01.447
That's why I want you near it.

18:01.910 --> 18:04.914
There's a lot more at stake here
than just your personal feelings.

18:04.952 --> 18:07.743
That android, skin job,
whatever you want to call it

18:08.005 --> 18:11.696
it represents just the first wave
of many, many more to come.

18:11.697 --> 18:15.901
And unlike what we're used to,
they don't require human operators.

18:17.150 --> 18:23.334
The brass says that we have to
give this thing a field test ... a dry run.

18:24.508 --> 18:27.299
- You gonna be reporting on that dry run.
- What?

18:27.076 --> 18:29.030
Listen, listen.
Listen to me.

18:30.534 --> 18:35.705
This thing could signify the end of
human involvement in law enforcement.

18:35.712 --> 18:36.780
Is that what you want?

18:37.160 --> 18:44.137
Or on the other hand if it should
just happen to wash out, so be it.

18:45.379 --> 18:48.938
Frankly, I think people would be a lot
happier with officers such as yourself,

18:48.999 --> 18:52.187
rather than those things.

18:52.599 --> 18:53.651
Hammond!

18:53.708 --> 18:57.609
I'd like to formally introduce you to

18:57.658 --> 19:05.223
Advance Autonomous Artificial Intelligence
Neuralnet Law Enforcement Droid

19:05.572 --> 19:07.297
I One.

19:07.435 --> 19:11.573
Advance autonomous ... look,
that's too long. I'll call you Andy.

19:11.811 --> 19:14.811
- You could call me Officer One.
- Sure.

19:15.230 --> 19:19.520
- How do you do?
- Do what?

19:20.721 --> 19:23.365
This thing's gonna be
interacting with the public?

19:26.619 --> 19:30.243
You can take that one right there.
Do you even need to sit?

19:30.355 --> 19:32.055
I can sit or stand.

19:32.399 --> 19:36.065
You might as well sit down, unless
you want me to hang my jacket on you.

19:36.134 --> 19:38.109
I'm not here for your
amusement, Sergent Hammond.

19:38.134 --> 19:41.297
If you would like me to ask for another
partner, I would be very happy to.

19:41.523 --> 19:44.294
Wait a minute.
Did you ask for me as a partner?

19:44.429 --> 19:45.477
Affirmative.

19:45.533 --> 19:46.987
And why would you do that?

19:47.241 --> 19:50.899
It was suggested to me that our
compatibility index would be high.

19:50.943 --> 19:53.723
<i>You might as well try
that coffee maker over there.</i>

19:55.210 --> 19:57.243
Do you think internal affairs sent him?

19:57.310 --> 20:02.357
No, we got them some bitches locked up
tightly in a froze ass in a tsunami.

20:02.827 --> 20:07.489
- No, he's not working for IA.
- Who's he working for then?

20:07.736 --> 20:11.439
He's working for us.
Just don't know it yet.

20:13.451 --> 20:15.237
We're getting our first assignment.

20:16.202 --> 20:17.294
<i>Hammond, you're up.</i>

20:17.348 --> 20:19.398
<i>We got a report of
a jumper over at 7th Street.</i>

20:19.493 --> 20:22.326
<i>All the boys are tied up downtown.
Can you handle that?</i>

20:22.334 --> 20:23.434
I'm on it.

20:24.168 --> 20:28.976
Do me a favour. Next time you get wind
of a call, let me know what it is first.

20:31.410 --> 20:33.531
This guy, ruining my day.

20:36.957 --> 20:38.894
I have to show this building today.

20:39.919 --> 20:40.736
Do you know him?

20:40.690 --> 20:43.689
Yeah. His name is Jake Wescott.
Lives on the 5th floor.

20:43.926 --> 20:46.106
You know. Comes and goes.
Kind of quiet.

20:46.204 --> 20:48.930
So he's never excited
to jump off the roof before.

20:49.936 --> 20:51.164
No.

20:51.206 --> 20:53.238
With your permission
I would like to go alone.

20:53.274 --> 20:54.571
Hell, no.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.646
My programming
addresses these scenarios.

20:56.655 --> 20:59.561
Oh, yeah. He's going to feel real
worthwhile when we send a robot

20:59.562 --> 21:03.522
or android out to talk to him.
That says we really care.

21:04.007 --> 21:05.691
I'm not following you.

21:06.678 --> 21:10.005
I've gone through several instances
like this in multiple simulations.

21:10.006 --> 21:12.668
See, those were simulations.
This is real life.

21:12.669 --> 21:15.373
There is a greater probability
for success if I were to go

21:15.374 --> 21:16.912
against someone such as yourself.

21:17.365 --> 21:19.344
"Such as myself", what
is that suppose to mean?

21:19.757 --> 21:22.030
Sorry guys.
Sorry to interrupt the guys big moment.

21:22.032 --> 21:24.724
Hey!
You want me to cite you?

21:28.732 --> 21:30.315
Andy, you stay right here.

21:34.665 --> 21:36.880
- Mr Wescott.
- That's far enough.

21:36.889 --> 21:39.605
- I'm not here to stop you Mr Wescott.
- Right.

21:39.607 --> 21:41.918
I only want to ask you
a couple of questions.

21:41.961 --> 21:44.101
Not really in the mood for questions.

21:44.275 --> 21:46.067
Oh, yeah.
I can see that.

21:46.355 --> 21:49.980
But Mr Wescott, are you by
any chance an organ donor?

21:50.432 --> 21:55.186
As you may know, organ donation
has saved countless lives and

21:55.627 --> 21:59.146
don't you think it's a good thing to
consider from a man in your situation.

21:59.728 --> 22:02.899
Most people your age who donate
their organs are in terrible accidents

22:02.900 --> 22:04.980
and not all of their
organs are even useful.

22:04.995 --> 22:07.469
But you're clearly in
good physical condition.

22:07.924 --> 22:09.631
Would be shame,
don't you think.

22:09.811 --> 22:13.179
I'm not going to donate my organs.

22:13.191 --> 22:15.590
Mr Wescott, if you just
allow me to make the call,

22:15.659 --> 22:18.352
I can get organ harvesters
over here in 5 minutes.

22:18.355 --> 22:20.762
They can euthanize you
in a humane manner.

22:20.763 --> 22:24.510
They can be painless. Then we can get your
organs out to somebody who really use them.

22:24.511 --> 22:25.863
You're insane!

22:33.745 --> 22:38.840
Wow.  Can you imagine the sensation
of impact from a fall from this height?

22:43.584 --> 22:44.682
Give me a moment.

22:46.862 --> 22:48.499
I told you to stay back.

22:49.087 --> 22:51.861
- We can go now.
- What are you talking about?

22:51.884 --> 22:54.511
The situation no longer
requires our presence.

22:55.860 --> 22:57.136
What?

22:58.472 --> 23:03.346
I've performed a micro-expression analysis
on the subject.  He will not hurt himself.

23:03.617 --> 23:04.299
Try telling that to the ...

23:04.300 --> 23:07.002
In addition I've initiated plan
to defuse the situation.

23:32.211 --> 23:33.610
Okay. What is it?

23:35.711 --> 23:37.606
I accessed his phone records.

23:37.895 --> 23:40.827
The majority were to an
individual who was not responding.

23:41.821 --> 23:44.400
Okay, so the woman ...
you, go on.

23:44.408 --> 23:47.445
I sent text from each other
with the data required to bring

23:47.446 --> 23:49.371
equilibrium to their social interaction.

23:49.780 --> 23:53.249
Ok. So you text at him pretending to
be her and her pretending to be him.

23:53.254 --> 23:54.569
So you lied.

23:55.038 --> 23:59.544
Each of them received the information
needed to restore their pair bonding.

24:00.537 --> 24:01.731
Pair bonding?

24:03.867 --> 24:05.883
I have access to her files.

24:07.570 --> 24:10.627
Your postrate and moral
superiority in questioning

24:10.628 --> 24:13.347
the legality of my method is suspect,

24:13.682 --> 24:16.188
when you proposed
to euthanize our subject.

24:16.538 --> 24:19.530
Hey, its been legal
in the state since 2024.

24:19.611 --> 24:21.335
Did you consider
the consequences that

24:21.336 --> 24:23.565
the subject were to take
you up on your proposal.

24:23.611 --> 24:27.568
Yes, his organs.
Let me ask you a question.

24:27.659 --> 24:30.919
What happens when they realize
that they didn't text each other.

24:32.078 --> 24:34.037
The outcome depends
on the amount of time

24:34.038 --> 24:36.381
that has transpired
before this interaction.

24:36.756 --> 24:39.353
The further the time
the greater the probabilty

24:39.354 --> 24:41.401
that they will
maintain the equilibrium.

24:42.134 --> 24:44.212
Would like to hear
the probability matrix?

24:44.213 --> 24:45.313
No.

24:45.513 --> 24:48.753
Just remind me to keep you from
interacting with anyone I know.

24:49.594 --> 24:52.304
- We're getting another call.
- Could you please stop that?

24:52.511 --> 24:55.794
Hammond you got a
missing persons case for you.

24:57.033 --> 25:00.021
See, that's why I told you to
tell me what it is before we  ...

25:01.436 --> 25:04.326
Ah, yeah.
Why put us on?

25:04.568 --> 25:07.820
You've gotta keep it low profile
for now, it's complicated.

25:08.090 --> 25:13.038
Yes, um.  I'm walking around with a
400 pound black robot with a white head.

25:13.142 --> 25:15.308
How low profile do you think we are?

25:17.000 --> 25:21.208
Look, you've been personally requested
by the mayor's office.  Just do it!

25:28.777 --> 25:30.994
- Sergeant Hammond.
- Stones.

25:31.141 --> 25:32.279
And this is?

25:32.732 --> 25:37.371
Advanced Autonomous Artificial Intelligence
Neuralnet Law Enforcement Droid I One.

25:37.474 --> 25:38.531
Andy.

25:38.611 --> 25:39.879
I get it.

25:40.114 --> 25:42.058
The mayor's very busy but he is
concerned about his daughter.

25:42.073 --> 25:43.565
So, the mayor has a daughter?

25:43.812 --> 25:47.190
Yes, now this wasn't public
knowledge until recently but

25:47.191 --> 25:48.791
when the quake devastated LA,

25:48.848 --> 25:52.059
the mayor sent his then infant daughter
to Brazil to live with her mother.

25:52.504 --> 25:53.872
He and his wife were estranged.

25:53.898 --> 25:56.278
When she passed away, his
daughter returned to Los Angeles.

25:56.280 --> 25:57.900
So is she the one who is missing?

25:58.177 --> 25:59.272
Not exactly.

26:09.056 --> 26:09.990
Your domestics?

26:09.999 --> 26:12.714
All androids like him.
It's a full tissue for us.

26:12.880 --> 26:16.805
Not as autonomous or as advanced,
they work off a program scripts.

26:18.162 --> 26:19.653
Robos.

26:33.182 --> 26:35.602
The mayor's daughter,
Helen Jacobs.

26:41.565 --> 26:43.470
Well, if she's not missing, who is?

26:43.546 --> 26:45.961
Her body.  She's connected
to a telepresence port.

26:46.477 --> 26:47.810
You're familiar with the concept.

26:47.861 --> 26:51.401
Oh yes. Robots are androids remotely
controlled to human brain waves.

26:51.410 --> 26:55.294
Pioneered by ACI Corporation
for dangerous military operations.

26:55.580 --> 26:58.167
Working in environments
that are not suitable for humans.

26:58.199 --> 27:01.366
Yes, as you are aware,
Detective Hammond,

27:01.743 --> 27:04.339
the success on the battlefields
led to many applications.

27:04.678 --> 27:08.035
They can give the wounded
a new lease on life, a new mobility,

27:08.038 --> 27:09.884
and freedom from their mortal bodies.

27:10.368 --> 27:14.336
So she is connected via
telepresence robot right now.

27:14.395 --> 27:17.744
An android.  One so sophisticated
it can pass through your eye.

27:17.872 --> 27:20.848
So why don't we just wake
her up and ask her where it is?

27:20.863 --> 27:22.739
It's not so simple.

27:23.263 --> 27:27.691
She suffered catasprophic injuries in
her accident, and she went into a coma.

27:27.809 --> 27:33.131
Now we were able to connect her to
an android body, but here's the kicker.

27:33.592 --> 27:35.811
She's not aware it is in her own body.

27:36.902 --> 27:38.852
She is not aware of her telepresence.

27:39.024 --> 27:40.320
Is that illegal?

27:40.438 --> 27:44.275
I'm told that the shock of waking up
and making such a discovery could be

27:44.293 --> 27:47.335
devastating to her.
Could lead to a psychotic break.

27:47.411 --> 27:52.066
As far as she is concerned, she had an
accident and she made it out just fine.

27:52.580 --> 27:54.094
How could she not know?

27:54.354 --> 27:57.169
The conscious mind believes what
it wants to believe, Detective.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.616
And you cannot track
her telepresence droid.

28:00.642 --> 28:02.146
She's gone outside the Grid.

28:02.212 --> 28:04.786
We believe she's gone into one
of the deconstructed zones,

28:04.787 --> 28:06.107
that's where you come in.

28:06.151 --> 28:08.090
You can go in there
with no problems.

28:09.145 --> 28:11.821
Well so, if I go in there
and I find her, what then?

28:11.822 --> 28:14.165
I mean she hasn't
committed any crimes.

28:14.168 --> 28:16.463
Secure her and bring her back here.

28:16.699 --> 28:20.088
Now under no circumstances
is she to be told what she is.

28:20.263 --> 28:22.214
Now if Helen wakes up here,
we'll handle that.

28:22.215 --> 28:26.103
But otherwise, she is just
a normal 24 year old woman.

28:26.462 --> 28:28.230
Who happens to be an android.

28:28.462 --> 28:32.791
Not 'be' one, 'existing' one.
You know the difference?

28:36.052 --> 28:38.004
<i>This zone is off limits.</i>

28:38.665 --> 28:40.469
So what happened to her?

28:40.802 --> 28:42.610
That's not relevant to this case and

28:42.611 --> 28:44.480
the mayor doesn't want
that information out there.

28:44.486 --> 28:46.291
Well, it might help us find her.

28:46.617 --> 28:47.738
Trust me, it won't.

28:47.757 --> 28:49.584
Is there something
in her personality

28:49.585 --> 28:51.849
that will make you think she
will be drawn to the Zones?

28:52.426 --> 28:56.188
Listen. The mayor and his daughter
don't always see eye to eye.

28:56.480 --> 28:58.781
She's a bit of an activist.

29:00.038 --> 29:04.030
When she got injured, we think she was in
the zones under the guise of some crusade.

29:04.666 --> 29:07.689
People being exploited
are her pet causes.

29:07.658 --> 29:10.289
Her father has enemies
on all sides of the law.

29:10.714 --> 29:14.520
If she went there under the
guise of some idealogical crusade,

29:14.522 --> 29:17.957
she could have run into somebody that
would hurt her just to get to her father.

29:17.972 --> 29:20.660
Well, even if they did run into
her, what could they do to her?

29:20.661 --> 29:24.859
I mean, her real body is right here
and the other one is an android.

29:25.504 --> 29:28.385
No offence Andy, but you know
what people do with androids.

29:28.432 --> 29:32.723
Manual labour, soldiers,
domestics, sex slaves.

29:33.074 --> 29:35.783
The mayor's daughter,
turned into a sex slave?

29:36.058 --> 29:37.975
Look even if it's
for your telepresence,

29:37.974 --> 29:40.798
that's something that we don't
even want to imagine, Detective.

29:41.510 --> 29:43.717
Find her, before they do.

30:05.230 --> 30:07.004
We could check the
underground markets.

30:07.005 --> 30:08.758
That won't be necessary.

30:09.081 --> 30:13.107
If she has been abducted, someone
with her attributes could end up there.

30:13.621 --> 30:17.136
And did you notice her
attributes, oh it's not that,

30:17.229 --> 30:19.463
I know somebody that
could help us find her.

30:22.980 --> 30:24.324
Porter, Porter, Porter.

30:24.722 --> 30:26.170
What is this?
Official business?

30:26.552 --> 30:28.960
Yes.
Have you seen this woman?

30:28.987 --> 30:30.750
What makes you think
I can help you with that?

30:31.158 --> 30:35.614
Don't bullshit me, Porter.
I can make it worth your while.

30:36.022 --> 30:40.104
I would not be in business if I turn
people over to anyone offering me a buck.

30:40.330 --> 30:44.626
You see, I'm not offering you a buck,
partner. I'm offering you your freedom.

30:45.462 --> 30:47.831
How can you offer me
something I already got?

30:48.004 --> 30:49.255
See my partner, here?

30:49.256 --> 30:51.161
He's not like you and me.

30:51.696 --> 30:53.147
See, he's an android.

30:53.341 --> 30:56.985
That means, you take the
empathy of a regular person,

30:57.076 --> 31:02.716
a normal person.  And you
divide that by that, say, 20,000.

31:03.023 --> 31:07.271
And you still won't be able to touch
his level of not giving a ground.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.115
And you're telling me this, why?

31:09.135 --> 31:10.850
Here's where I'm gonna help you,

31:10.852 --> 31:13.274
See, he doesn't give a damn about you.

31:13.285 --> 31:18.070
See, he can look deep into your
shit, if you know what I mean.

31:19.454 --> 31:21.838
No, I don't.

31:22.399 --> 31:27.388
Your business, Porter.
He could look deep into it.

31:29.089 --> 31:32.785
Andy, show him what
I'm talking about.

31:35.515 --> 31:37.186
I'm assessing his records.

31:40.439 --> 31:43.155
I can find nothing that
substantiates filing charges.

31:45.405 --> 31:47.262
Woh, what about his bank records?

31:47.616 --> 31:55.257
I'm sure embezzlement might offer up some
numerical residue that we can sniff into.

31:58.256 --> 32:02.220
This individual is clean.
He pays his bills.

32:02.665 --> 32:05.006
His deposits matches
employer records.

32:05.361 --> 32:08.093
I do show that he is
expecting a tax refund.

32:09.746 --> 32:11.993
- Give us a minute.
- Absolutely.

32:14.464 --> 32:17.807
Look.  You need to go
along with me on this, okay?

32:17.815 --> 32:21.722
You know those text
messages that you falsified?

32:21.951 --> 32:24.849
I do not see how threatening
this individual help our case.

32:25.908 --> 32:28.220
Preferable tactic would
be to get in his trust.

32:28.222 --> 32:31.140
Well, you need to do a
little in getting my trust.

32:31.409 --> 32:33.750
Are you looking for results

32:33.755 --> 32:37.393
or are using this interaction as an
outlet for suppressed aggression?

32:37.941 --> 32:40.865
Results.
Watch me.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.484
Listen, asshole.

32:49.701 --> 32:52.132
I know people like you
provide guide services

32:52.133 --> 32:53.926
for people going in
and out of the zone.

32:53.954 --> 32:55.120
Oh yeah, that's ...

32:55.234 --> 32:59.929
Damn!  That is illegal.
That violates the quarantine.

33:00.914 --> 33:04.327
This woman has been in and
out of this zone quite often.

33:04.347 --> 33:06.836
Clearly, someone has helped her.

33:07.661 --> 33:09.053
Not by me.

33:09.226 --> 33:10.628
Is that right?

33:12.589 --> 33:13.647
Okay.

33:15.648 --> 33:19.360
Then tell me, some other
operators. Give me their names.

33:20.127 --> 33:21.887
That's beyond my scope.

33:24.865 --> 33:26.089
What are you doing?

33:27.303 --> 33:28.843
This is not working.

33:29.693 --> 33:33.514
Oh, okay. You're trying to
play good cop, bad cop.

33:34.025 --> 33:35.709
Good cop, bad cop.

33:35.975 --> 33:39.416
- Yeah, it's where one of us ...
- I'm familiar with the technique.

33:40.180 --> 33:44.127
Oh, are you?  Well, you're doing
a good job at playing mediocre cop.

33:44.911 --> 33:48.133
I tell you what.
You need me, I'll be at the bar.

33:58.853 --> 34:02.005
Please accept the apology of the
Police Department for Officer Hammond.

34:02.003 --> 34:03.772
He's experiencing difficulties.

34:03.773 --> 34:07.511
Oh yeah.  Well, that's no excuse
for roughing somebody up.

34:08.004 --> 34:11.395
Of course it isn't.
Would you like to file charges?

34:11.719 --> 34:15.109
That, ah, isn't necessary.

34:15.563 --> 34:19.027
I'm equipped to accept verbal
statements for filing charges.

34:19.145 --> 34:22.326
Look, I .. 
I don't want to file charges.

34:22.395 --> 34:24.130
Are you afraid he may retaliate?

34:24.851 --> 34:28.589
No. No, no, no, no.
See, it's not my way. Okay.

34:29.123 --> 34:32.985
I don't file charges against cops.
Uh, uh.

34:33.094 --> 34:34.867
Are you at all afraid of the police? 

34:34.967 --> 34:36.755
Would you like to add
that to your statement?

34:36.947 --> 34:40.464
No.  God damn it, man!
What's ...

34:40.465 --> 34:44.063
If you are threatened by the police
at any time, we can offer protection.

34:44.243 --> 34:46.795
I don't need protection.

34:47.324 --> 34:49.800
Hey look, I'm sorry.
He's malfunctioning.

34:49.801 --> 34:50.772
What?

34:50.773 --> 34:52.944
All system scans are
at acceptable levels.

34:53.659 --> 34:57.130
No, there's something wrong.  We
need to get back to HQ.  Let's go.

34:57.132 --> 34:59.798
You're interfering with
an ongoing investigation.

34:59.814 --> 35:01.624
It is against departmental code.

35:02.984 --> 35:04.497
We need to go.

35:05.156 --> 35:07.176
You are pursuing unlawful behaviour.

35:07.912 --> 35:11.715
Well then, write me up.
File charges.  Let's go.

35:11.768 --> 35:14.237
You can leave.
I'm continuing this investigation.

35:14.238 --> 35:16.004
Well, I see how this
is gonna go down.

35:23.583 --> 35:26.098
You are in risk of bodily
injury or destruction.

35:26.589 --> 35:28.553
Jesus, you guys are nuts!

35:34.038 --> 35:37.694
It's okay everybody.
I got this all under control.

35:49.384 --> 35:53.029
- You accomplished a lot.
- Yes I did.

35:53.386 --> 35:56.195
The adrenalin is affecting your
reasoning and decision making.

35:56.530 --> 35:57.653
Track his calls.

35:58.120 --> 36:00.589
- Who?
- Porter.

36:00.590 --> 36:02.746
He's about to call her right now.
Can you track it?

36:02.991 --> 36:05.086
- Affirmative.
- Go ahead.

36:06.702 --> 36:08.787
You're not concerned about her
being aware of our interest?

36:09.967 --> 36:11.075
No.

36:11.705 --> 36:14.345
Safer this way we don't
want to sneak up on her.

36:18.810 --> 36:23.355
He's making a call.
I've obtained the address.

36:25.455 --> 36:27.507
Zone 12 is home to 7 major gangs,

36:28.508 --> 36:30.646
innumerous subgroups
all fighting for control.

36:31.265 --> 36:32.900
Is it wise we go it alone?

36:32.903 --> 36:38.063
Don't worry. We going in the back way.
No sirens, no lights. No ones expecting us.

36:38.240 --> 36:40.828
We'll be out before
they know we're there.

36:47.869 --> 36:50.325
Sir, they're on the move.

36:50.600 --> 36:53.850
Good. Good. Notify me
when they reach the target.

36:53.867 --> 36:54.811
Yes, sir.

36:57.780 --> 37:02.686
Yeah.  Put out the word.  The ones who
killed Dext will be in the Zone tonight.

37:03.378 --> 37:06.842
Wait for my signal.
Yeah.

37:10.878 --> 37:14.408
- Still have a lock on the location?
- It's an unregistered Paygo phone.

37:15.009 --> 37:16.561
No guarantee it's hers.

37:17.630 --> 37:19.614
Maybe it's Porter's dry cleaner.

37:19.778 --> 37:22.407
There are no registered
dry cleaners in this area.

37:37.372 --> 37:38.520
They've entered the Zone.

37:38.875 --> 37:41.843
Good.  Soon as they make
contact I need to know.

37:42.031 --> 37:44.725
- Are we still getting transmission?
- Yes, sir.

37:45.022 --> 37:47.614
What about the manual override option?

37:47.660 --> 37:49.861
You think you could switch
them into manual override?

37:50.505 --> 37:53.329
Of course.
You want me to do it now?

37:53.330 --> 37:56.657
No, no, no.
Just wait for my signal.

37:57.202 --> 37:58.278
Yes, sir.

38:01.543 --> 38:04.850
I hear that Helen Jacobs is more
than just a mere visitor to the Zone,

38:04.852 --> 38:06.137
she is a vigilante.

38:06.615 --> 38:10.643
The thing about the Zone is, you can
pretty much get anything you want.

38:10.817 --> 38:13.964
It's outside the law,
but it's a price you have to pay.

38:14.767 --> 38:17.589
Stay there too long and
you're affected by the radiation.

38:18.234 --> 38:23.771
Criminals can come and go but the ...
people, regular folks, get stuck there.

38:23.871 --> 38:26.368
Knows the people she's fighting for.

38:31.431 --> 38:34.559
Relax. Relax.

38:35.487 --> 38:37.127
How's the operation going?

38:37.296 --> 38:40.500
Like clockwork, sir.
The officers are nearly at their target.

38:40.730 --> 38:42.870
Tell me again, about this.

38:42.873 --> 38:47.271
Well, it's always been our goal
to rid this zone of gang lords.

38:47.461 --> 38:51.232
Last week's raid was
step 1, this is step 2.

38:52.040 --> 38:54.900
Once Officer Hammond and his
partner acquire their targets,

38:54.930 --> 38:57.337
they'll be 14 miles into the zone.

38:57.983 --> 39:01.580
Due to the contamination,
there's only one safe way out.

39:01.831 --> 39:05.822
Fortunately for us, that safe way
leads them pass each gang territory

39:05.830 --> 39:08.182
one by one, by one.

39:08.890 --> 39:10.459
It'll be kill or be killed.

39:10.617 --> 39:12.476
Now, the beauty of this, sir, is 

39:12.477 --> 39:15.636
they'll be taking the
gangs out for us, one by one.

39:15.657 --> 39:17.041
And if they should be taken out, 

39:17.042 --> 39:20.022
then we'll be justified
in going in for retaliation.

39:20.596 --> 39:22.349
It's a win-win, sir.

39:25.306 --> 39:28.369
But what if they make it back?

39:29.865 --> 39:32.577
There's no chance
of that happening, sir.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.880
That woman ... 

39:39.481 --> 39:43.200
that they're after,
that's not my daughter.

39:45.373 --> 39:50.030
She is trying to destroy me.

39:50.039 --> 39:52.624
Sir, no one is going
to let that happen.

39:53.407 --> 39:55.767
We have a manual
override on the droid,

39:55.768 --> 39:59.201
so if it comes to that,
he'll take 'em out.

39:59.765 --> 40:03.526
But, why not we just let
them do our dirty work for us.

40:03.527 --> 40:05.313
Clean up the zones.

40:07.354 --> 40:12.463
The city needs more
men like you, Officer.

40:12.491 --> 40:13.860
Thank you, sir.

40:19.508 --> 40:21.759
Who are you guys?

40:21.908 --> 40:25.009
You can just call us the
future of law enforcement.

40:30.684 --> 40:36.184
Then I think the
city is in good hands.

40:41.897 --> 40:46.139
- We are within 500 m of the signal.
- Okay.

40:47.435 --> 40:49.043
We go on foot from here.

41:09.421 --> 41:12.963
<i>We're on official police business.
There is nothing to see here.</i>

41:13.201 --> 41:15.007
<i>Return to your dwellings.</i>

41:15.713 --> 41:17.673
Why don't you just call
the rest of them out?

41:18.522 --> 41:22.189
It is better we make our presence
known, than to surreptitiously advance.

41:22.369 --> 41:23.830
We'll see about that.

41:24.124 --> 41:25.708
Are we close to the signal?

41:26.681 --> 41:28.121
Within 50 yards.

41:28.627 --> 41:31.459
- Call it.
- I'm sorry.

41:32.036 --> 41:35.965
- Call the phone.
- Calling.

41:39.538 --> 41:40.664
Over there.

41:57.712 --> 41:58.781
Great.

42:08.123 --> 42:11.524
We need to get back to the vehicle.
Plan B.

42:12.095 --> 42:13.657
What is Plan B?

42:17.423 --> 42:18.721
Can you call HQ?

42:19.610 --> 42:21.420
And now you're
considering calling for backup?

42:21.421 --> 42:22.849
Look, just call it.

42:25.385 --> 42:29.361
- Something's interfering.
- Great.

42:29.379 --> 42:33.075
A throw-away cellphone works, but a
trillion dollar robot can't get through.

42:33.312 --> 42:36.207
- I am not a robot.
- Figure of speech.

42:36.242 --> 42:38.083
Sorry for calling you the R word.

42:39.083 --> 42:41.525
It appears that I'm having
a block from the other side.

42:42.663 --> 42:44.998
So why don't you just call 911?

42:46.078 --> 42:48.287
Police services had been
discontinued in this zone.

42:48.334 --> 42:51.540
It was a joke. You should've asked
the wizard for a sense of humour.

42:51.542 --> 42:54.605
Look, let's just get to
the car and call for backup.

42:55.912 --> 42:57.442
Who is the wizard?

43:04.603 --> 43:06.951
Stop! Stop!
Get down.

43:13.826 --> 43:16.162
- Helen Jacobs.
- Yeah.

43:16.531 --> 43:18.336
We're here to escort you in.

43:18.414 --> 43:21.671
Thanks.  But I think you're going
to be the ones needing an escort.

43:25.715 --> 43:27.199
How did you know about the bomb?

43:27.530 --> 43:29.180
I've been down here
long enough to know

43:29.181 --> 43:31.901
that when someone
crawls under a parked car

43:31.902 --> 43:33.495
they're not a
welcoming committee.

43:33.497 --> 43:35.375
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

43:35.380 --> 43:37.889
We were told you maybe
coerced into a sex ring.

43:38.831 --> 43:39.949
That's tactful.

43:40.130 --> 43:41.342
Yeah, and if I was,

43:41.343 --> 43:45.329
it probably would be more
of a public relations issue

43:45.330 --> 43:47.478
than any concern to
my personal welfare.

43:47.611 --> 43:48.740
It was mentioned.

43:49.150 --> 43:50.630
Damn it Andy,
would you back off.

43:50.635 --> 43:52.230
Listen, you need to come with us.

43:52.276 --> 43:54.440
- Am I under arrest?
- Well, no.

43:54.444 --> 43:56.087
Have you committed any crime
that may warrant an arrest?

43:56.088 --> 43:57.464
Would you, would you shut..

43:58.025 --> 43:59.825
Look, you need to
come with us right now.

43:59.826 --> 44:01.994
No, you need to come with me.
Now.

44:01.995 --> 44:04.772
That explosion is going to draw
everything out of the woodwork.

44:05.015 --> 44:07.549
I can't be responsible for
what happens to you guys.

44:10.601 --> 44:12.328
Is that the best video you got?

44:12.394 --> 44:14.089
Yes, sir.  That's the
best we can do right now.

44:14.111 --> 44:16.407
- And we can't get audio?
- I'm working on it.

44:17.384 --> 44:21.835
Halt!  That's her.
I'll take that as a positive ID.

44:21.860 --> 44:26.532
- Did we take out the vehicle?
- Negative, Sir. That wasn't us.

44:27.119 --> 44:29.265
Oh, they're gonna have a fun night.

44:33.520 --> 44:37.065
Hey, it's a go.
Put out the word.

44:37.664 --> 44:45.300
Dext's killer would be in Zone 12,
Grid 16.  Headed east on foot.

44:46.485 --> 44:48.305
Now you do whatever
you want with the girl.

44:48.308 --> 44:50.945
But you make sure
neither of them get out alive.

45:03.512 --> 45:07.352
Okay. Okay, look.
Nothing to see here.

45:07.336 --> 45:09.211
That's not what I see.

45:10.411 --> 45:13.399
Look, you're not our concern.
Kindly step aside.

45:13.536 --> 45:17.047
Oh, we will. As soon as
we're finished with you.

45:17.153 --> 45:19.214
I'm going to pretend
I didn't even hear that.

45:19.215 --> 45:21.326
Cause, I'm trying to
be a nice guy, okay.

45:21.524 --> 45:23.555
Now there are a couple of
ways this is gonna go down,

45:23.558 --> 45:25.791
and none of them
turn out so good for you.

45:25.908 --> 45:27.978
<i>You're interfering with police business.</i>

45:28.473 --> 45:30.508
<i>Stand aside, or you
will be subject to force.</i>

45:30.509 --> 45:32.595
Andy. Andy.
I got this.

45:32.688 --> 45:37.464
Look. We're not after you but we can
be if you wanted to go down like that.

45:37.791 --> 45:40.165
I could charge you all
with obstructing justice.

45:40.166 --> 45:42.535
Stand down or you
will be subject to force.

45:47.797 --> 45:49.117
Stop!

45:50.374 --> 45:53.384
You have a hammer.
I have a hammer too.

45:53.451 --> 45:55.010
Mine is better.

46:00.140 --> 46:03.765
Oh yeah, oh yeah. You are one
hell of a negotiator, aren't you?

46:03.971 --> 46:05.389
That was a lethal weapon.

46:05.456 --> 46:07.058
That was an axe.
This is LA.

46:07.059 --> 46:10.643
If I shot everybody that came at me with an
axe, I'd never get through the paperwork.

46:10.735 --> 46:14.655
Besides, the plan was to
go in and out, under the radar,

46:14.656 --> 46:15.900
and not ring the damn dinner bell.

46:15.901 --> 46:18.340
Your negotiations would have
been with the same results.

46:18.380 --> 46:20.500
Oh, you're so damn
confident aren't you?

46:20.505 --> 46:22.039
Confidence is outside of my parameters.

46:22.183 --> 46:24.323
So this is outside your parameter.

46:26.887 --> 46:31.351
And you.  You're trying to
kill all of us.  You included.

46:31.689 --> 46:34.405
If this isn't your territory,
why are you here?

46:35.022 --> 46:36.286
Okay. Come on.

46:44.268 --> 46:46.807
- Woh.
- That's okay. They're with me.

46:48.682 --> 46:49.698
Come on.

47:06.515 --> 47:07.536
Ready?

47:10.055 --> 47:14.731
That's okay, just ... show them,
show them your baby.

47:35.850 --> 47:38.467
My scan show that the
child is completely normal.

47:39.369 --> 47:41.546
Yeah, we can see that,
but what does it mean?

47:42.254 --> 47:45.030
If this environment were radioactive,

47:45.038 --> 47:47.536
you wouldn't be able to
have babies without mutations.

47:47.576 --> 47:48.721
You are correct.

47:49.157 --> 47:53.489
Mutations resulting from
radioactive fallout occur prior to birth.

47:54.324 --> 47:55.416
So you're saying...

47:55.791 --> 47:57.850
People are not getting
sick because of radiation.

47:57.853 --> 48:01.108
It's something else. It's something
introduced into the environment.

48:01.116 --> 48:04.360
Why, like poison?
Why would anyone want to do that?

48:04.684 --> 48:05.908
Land value.

48:06.993 --> 48:11.915
Look at Los Angeles. We have, what, 30
million people, and no room to house them.

48:12.378 --> 48:15.820
If someone reviewed the Zone,
it would have more than enough room.

48:15.822 --> 48:20.616
So, keeping this area
off limits to development

48:20.619 --> 48:23.510
increases the value of
whatever available land there is.

48:23.877 --> 48:25.609
So who would benefit from that?

48:26.052 --> 48:27.796
Whoever who owns their land.

48:29.525 --> 48:31.625
And with the quarantine, I guess, 

48:31.626 --> 48:34.361
nobody could come in
here and see what's going on.

48:34.856 --> 48:36.523
You need to leave.

48:37.691 --> 48:39.812
All right buddy, I'm
right here with you.

48:39.851 --> 48:44.843
This place is a sanctuary. You can't
stay here. They can't get caught here.

48:44.956 --> 48:47.054
Pick on me. Psst.

48:49.296 --> 48:52.715
The major shareholder of the properties
would benefit most from a scheme like this.

48:52.720 --> 48:56.961
Yeah, I know.
My father.

49:03.207 --> 49:04.639
We have to go.

49:06.701 --> 49:08.180
Why would you help us?

49:09.118 --> 49:11.396
I know you don't remember me, but...

49:12.691 --> 49:15.545
I think you saved my life.
At the boundary.

49:15.922 --> 49:19.289
At Deorogan, you don't remember it?

49:22.378 --> 49:23.914
You have to leave now.

49:24.535 --> 49:25.928
Give me a minute.

49:38.093 --> 49:39.917
Why would they want us to get her out?

49:41.013 --> 49:42.989
Maybe they're afraid of
what she might discover.

49:43.191 --> 49:44.904
Couldn't they just disconnect her?

49:44.928 --> 49:47.286
Cos her body back home
know what she knows here?

49:47.922 --> 49:50.164
You know that.
They're connected.

49:50.435 --> 49:53.060
That Helen is the same as this body.

49:53.068 --> 49:54.849
We need to get her
into protective custody.

49:55.661 --> 49:58.646
I'll call Mills. He's solid.
We'll get backup.

49:59.069 --> 50:02.386
Just the two of us.  I don't
think we'll make it out alive.

50:02.950 --> 50:04.246
Alive!

50:05.027 --> 50:06.816
Well, in your case, functional.

50:10.006 --> 50:11.536
We need to call for an extraction.

50:12.552 --> 50:16.620
We have to get on top of high ground,
preferably a building would be ideal

50:16.827 --> 50:19.160
then he could contact the
cell towers to line of sight.

50:19.166 --> 50:20.897
Do you know any place like that?

50:21.224 --> 50:22.492
I have an idea.

50:38.551 --> 50:40.847
You're a long way from home.

50:41.944 --> 50:45.060
You kill Dext, and we all forget.

50:48.250 --> 50:52.218
Sergeant!  The iron sky is
picking up gunfire in Zone 12.

50:52.269 --> 50:55.192
Oh. Oh. Well it's about time.
Let's move out.

51:05.612 --> 51:06.722
- Williams.
- Yes, Sir.

51:06.748 --> 51:10.016
I want you to notify me of any
changes of their status or position.

51:10.017 --> 51:10.723
Yes, Sir.

51:10.764 --> 51:15.743
And I want officers at that medport
standing by in case we need to go to Plan B.

51:15.815 --> 51:17.275
Already in route, Sir.

51:17.535 --> 51:22.560
Excellent.  Well you sit back
and enjoy the show, son.

51:22.563 --> 51:23.609
Copy that.

52:36.424 --> 52:38.013
That was the weak gang?

52:46.690 --> 52:50.254
There. Pueblo Mueta.

52:51.720 --> 52:55.607
Pueblo Mueta.
Has a nice ring to it.

52:56.021 --> 52:58.353
One thing's for sure.
They heard us coming.

52:59.345 --> 53:02.133
- Are you sure we need to go up there?
- Affirmative.

53:02.361 --> 53:05.029
You two may stay here.
I will go alone.

53:05.365 --> 53:10.154
Well, I don't get to go to Pueblo Mueta.
What would I tell my kids?

53:10.437 --> 53:14.626
- You have kids?
- Well, not yet.

53:15.730 --> 53:17.738
Okay.  Let's ... let's do it.

53:49.132 --> 53:50.687
Go.  Go. Move.

54:23.065 --> 54:24.392
Go. Go. Go.

55:26.207 --> 55:29.191
- Williams.  Come in.
- This is Williams.  Go ahead.

55:29.291 --> 55:30.642
I need a status update.

55:33.195 --> 55:37.377
We got more ground fire.
Looks like the PM tower.

55:38.501 --> 55:41.166
Sir, what do we do if they contact us?

55:44.014 --> 55:47.316
You tell them to sit tight.
Calvary's coming.

55:51.970 --> 55:54.109
Yeah.  Sit tight.

56:05.762 --> 56:11.024
Well hello, Pueblo Mueta.
We need to find a staircase.

56:11.113 --> 56:12.612
Accessing blueprints.

56:14.880 --> 56:15.934
This way.

56:22.660 --> 56:24.008
Oooh!

56:27.201 --> 56:28.778
You know what?
We have to go through.

56:31.603 --> 56:32.389
Ooooh!

56:33.867 --> 56:36.402
I guess not everybody exist on rats.

56:38.872 --> 56:40.641
Uh, cannibals?

56:41.706 --> 56:43.737
Dang, cannibals.

56:49.174 --> 56:50.914
Bring me their guts.

56:51.296 --> 56:52.898
You can get through us.

56:57.776 --> 57:01.791
Hey policeman.
Where are you going?

57:02.587 --> 57:04.035
Andy, come on.

57:05.969 --> 57:07.365
Andy, what are you doing?

57:11.625 --> 57:13.520
Hey, what are you doing?
Come on.

57:18.016 --> 57:20.785
- I'll handle this. Keep moving.
- What?

57:39.618 --> 57:40.695
Hammond.

57:48.096 --> 57:49.095
Hammond!

58:05.721 --> 58:06.513
Hey, you!

58:18.483 --> 58:19.628
Come on.

58:31.465 --> 58:32.340
Let's go.

58:47.565 --> 58:50.490
- Can you connect to the cell tower?
- Working on it.

58:51.879 --> 58:53.416
Connecting.

59:20.666 --> 59:24.192
This is Officer One of Special Unit,
requesting extraction.

59:24.861 --> 59:26.969
Sending coordinates now.

59:37.271 --> 59:38.486
Officer One.

59:38.849 --> 59:41.971
We're discharge to the nearest
secured unit to your location.

59:42.246 --> 59:44.641
Please standby for estimated arrival.

59:45.642 --> 59:48.124
The Commander will
be here in 5 minutes.

01:00:22.425 --> 01:00:24.116
I'm like him.

01:00:28.713 --> 01:00:31.690
Williams.
Stand by for my command.

01:00:31.693 --> 01:00:35.595
If we need to go into manual
override, I want to know my signal.

01:00:35.772 --> 01:00:38.645
Copy that.
I'll wait for your signal.

01:00:44.827 --> 01:00:48.210
I mean like, not like him.
Like ...

01:00:54.271 --> 01:01:00.135
Yeah I, I suspected ... I mean
... the fragments, the memories.

01:01:04.810 --> 01:01:12.525
Have you seen it?  Me.
The body have. Have you seen it?

01:01:13.486 --> 01:01:17.468
Oh yes, we've seen you.

01:01:18.946 --> 01:01:22.303
That. That's not me.
This is me.

01:01:22.981 --> 01:01:28.071
Yeah, we know. And we won't
let anything happen to you.

01:01:33.223 --> 01:01:34.492
Okay.

01:02:08.117 --> 01:02:10.363
Yeah.
That's one of ours.

01:02:24.783 --> 01:02:25.785
Hammond.

01:02:26.325 --> 01:02:27.413
Jones.

01:02:27.949 --> 01:02:29.401
Out on a mission?

01:02:29.967 --> 01:02:33.270
A lot of guys for
just a simple extraction.

01:02:33.332 --> 01:02:35.981
Ay, we were out on an exercise.

01:02:36.004 --> 01:02:38.275
<i>Helen, Hammond back away.</i>

01:02:39.087 --> 01:02:42.645
<i>Your micro-expression reveal
a hidden agenda, Sergeant.</i>

01:02:42.807 --> 01:02:44.569
My micro-expressions.

01:02:44.895 --> 01:02:48.694
Hot damn, you think that is
pretty friggin' awesome, aren't you?

01:02:49.042 --> 01:02:53.342
Well I always get a kick out of
spending some time with your kind.

01:02:54.038 --> 01:02:57.034
Now was that a lie or not?

01:02:57.475 --> 01:02:59.857
<i>Hammond, take the girl and go.</i>

01:03:02.125 --> 01:03:07.981
Hammond, partner's gone batty.  We
might have to take him in for a overhaul.

01:03:10.694 --> 01:03:14.450
Hey, you gonna end up
on the scrap heap for that.

01:03:15.006 --> 01:03:19.842
You won't shoot me.  You were
designed to protect and serve.

01:03:22.364 --> 01:03:25.875
<i>But you said, I may be malfunctioning.</i>

01:03:26.817 --> 01:03:29.249
Williams, we need
that manual override.

01:03:29.327 --> 01:03:34.608
Initiating manual override control.
In 3, 2, 1.

01:03:42.505 --> 01:03:43.442
Hammond!

01:03:49.818 --> 01:03:51.097
What .. what are you doing?

01:03:51.730 --> 01:03:53.526
I don't know.
I'm not doing this.

01:03:57.184 --> 01:03:59.758
Stop where you are
or I will shoot you.

01:04:00.997 --> 01:04:03.649
<i>Helen, someone has
overwritten his control.</i>

01:04:05.032 --> 01:04:06.497
What the hell are you talking about?

01:04:06.552 --> 01:04:08.268
<i>Helen.
Shoot him.</i>

01:04:10.939 --> 01:04:13.887
What the hell is happening to me?
Drop your weapon.

01:04:14.279 --> 01:04:17.195
<i>You're one of us, man.
You're an android cop.</i>

01:04:17.196 --> 01:04:18.296
Shut up!

01:04:18.881 --> 01:04:20.500
Williams, what's going on?

01:04:20.506 --> 01:04:22.419
His protocols are
deeper than I thought.

01:04:22.446 --> 01:04:24.386
But the droid
Hammond still ain't go.

01:04:24.389 --> 01:04:27.601
Well, I don't care. You'd
better fix it.  Fix it, man.

01:04:27.604 --> 01:04:30.612
<i>Shoot him in the temporal
lobe, on the side of the head.</i>

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:31.830
I can't!

01:04:33.649 --> 01:04:35.298
I am not an android!

01:04:35.456 --> 01:04:39.209
<i>You must do it.  It is the only
way to remove their control.</i>

01:04:45.770 --> 01:04:49.029
An android we can
pass through your eye.

01:04:49.891 --> 01:04:53.234
A little easier to defence, man
and I've got a camera, Sarge.

01:04:54.406 --> 01:04:55.279
Right.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:58.737
You know what you sound like
when you say you don't like machines.

01:04:58.784 --> 01:04:59.933
You're dead!

01:05:01.399 --> 01:05:04.862
The central nervous system is fine,
but the spine has been severed.

01:05:05.342 --> 01:05:07.416
He is paralyzed from the waist down.

01:05:08.708 --> 01:05:10.179
When will he wake up?

01:05:10.924 --> 01:05:13.082
Well, I wouldn't call
it waking up exactly.

01:05:13.442 --> 01:05:16.797
But if this works, he'll go right
back to work in his old position.

01:05:26.668 --> 01:05:28.236
I can't do it.

01:05:33.873 --> 01:05:36.020
<i>Hammond!
Eliminate her.</i>

01:05:42.725 --> 01:05:43.980
I'm unarmed.

01:05:47.224 --> 01:05:48.540
You gonna shoot me?

01:05:48.543 --> 01:05:50.950
<i>This is a direct order.
That woman is a terrorist and</i>

01:05:50.951 --> 01:05:54.176
<i>an enemy of the state.
I have Directive 109 to terminate her.</i>

01:05:57.308 --> 01:05:59.269
Hang on.
We gonna take you out of here.

01:05:59.270 --> 01:06:00.844
<i>This zone is off limits.</i>

01:06:26.486 --> 01:06:27.457
Go!

01:06:29.805 --> 01:06:31.883
Run!  I ...
Run now!

01:06:49.346 --> 01:06:51.061
I said, leave now.

01:07:03.617 --> 01:07:06.571
I'm gonna finish this.
Get your back. Come on.

01:07:14.945 --> 01:07:16.041
Back to land.

01:07:46.221 --> 01:07:48.620
You need proof that the
people here are being poisoned.

01:07:48.625 --> 01:07:51.545
I've been taking blood samples
of people all over the zones.

01:07:51.555 --> 01:07:53.936
Whatever is poisoning
them, it's in their blood.

01:07:53.937 --> 01:07:56.508
I just don't know how they
are administering the poison.

01:07:56.509 --> 01:07:58.275
- It's in the food.
- What?

01:07:58.488 --> 01:07:59.991
It's in the food drops.

01:08:00.347 --> 01:08:04.030
When I was at your house, I saw
a picture of your father, the Mayor,

01:08:04.031 --> 01:08:06.430
receiving commendations
for the food drops.

01:08:06.437 --> 01:08:08.914
Whatever is poisoning
all the people, is in the food.

01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:11.270
We need to get the story out there.

01:08:11.272 --> 01:08:13.230
I have a contact that
will get this story out.

01:08:13.233 --> 01:08:15.500
Believe me, he is
no friend of your father's.

01:08:17.468 --> 01:08:18.580
<i>Take the floor!</i>

01:08:18.584 --> 01:08:21.090
Williams, come in.
We need to go to Stage 2.

01:08:21.091 --> 01:08:22.979
Plan B is now in effect.

01:08:22.983 --> 01:08:24.096
<i>Are you sure?</i>

01:08:24.868 --> 01:08:27.290
No, you're right.
Maybe I should reconsider.

01:08:27.291 --> 01:08:31.107
Yes, I'm sure.
Don't ever question me again!

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:08.859
Something's wrong.

01:09:09.341 --> 01:09:10.550
<i>Hello Hammond.</i>

01:09:10.585 --> 01:09:15.774
<i>Right now, I imagine you feeling kind
a squeasy, well put us all in a start.</i>

01:09:15.853 --> 01:09:16.939
What have they done?

01:09:16.939 --> 01:09:19.359
<i>Your life support has
been disconnected.</i>

01:09:19.363 --> 01:09:23.555
<i>I'm afraid it was some kind of accident,
at least that's the official report.</i>

01:09:24.015 --> 01:09:25.600
<i>I don't know
how long you have,</i>

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:28.028
<i>your body can't function
long without the machines.</i>

01:09:28.078 --> 01:09:29.380
<i>It's ironic, isn't it.</i>

01:09:29.383 --> 01:09:33.515
<i>But I'm ravelling, how long do
you have, maybe 20 minutes.</i>

01:09:33.845 --> 01:09:34.799
Bastard.

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:38.763
<i>Maam, I'm sorry to say that you will
soon be experiencing the same thing,</i>

01:09:38.764 --> 01:09:42.136
<i>and I'd like to say it was tough convincing
your father it was necessary, but</i>

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:44.948
<i>let's say the Mayor was pragmatic.
Now where were we?</i>

01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:46.417
<i>Oh Hammond!
Yes.</i>

01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:47.511
<i>There is a solution.</i>

01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:51.335
<i>Give up and we'll plug you and
your father and your friends back in.</i>

01:09:51.337 --> 01:09:54.231
<i>Whatever you think you know,
whatever information you have,</i>

01:09:54.233 --> 01:09:55.816
<i>is not going to make a difference.</i>

01:09:56.036 --> 01:09:57.565
<i>And you're both going to die.</i>

01:09:58.349 --> 01:10:00.640
<i>Tick tock.
We'll be waiting on you.</i>

01:10:00.776 --> 01:10:03.620
Andy.  What is the
fastest way to Media Centre?

01:10:03.627 --> 01:10:06.688
No, we have to go to your house,
where your body is being kept.

01:10:06.744 --> 01:10:09.204
<i>Helen Jacobs body is not at her house.</i>

01:10:09.561 --> 01:10:10.540
How do you know that?

01:10:10.547 --> 01:10:13.280
<i>They would have expected that.
They have moved the body.</i>

01:10:13.281 --> 01:10:14.300
Do you know where?

01:10:14.303 --> 01:10:17.211
<i>I may be able to link it
to the nurse's tracking device.</i>

01:10:17.511 --> 01:10:19.899
<i>I logged on to it
when I was at the hospital.</i>

01:10:20.032 --> 01:10:21.442
Yeah, I know you have a thing for it.

01:10:21.629 --> 01:10:22.932
<i>I have the location.</i>

01:10:22.986 --> 01:10:25.802
Good. We can have the
media to meet us there.

01:10:26.238 --> 01:10:27.423
What about you?

01:10:27.425 --> 01:10:28.427
Forget about me.

01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:29.930
I'm not going to let you die.

01:10:29.937 --> 01:10:30.719
<i>Calculating.</i>

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:34.314
Look. You think those assholes are going
to let me or any of us live after this?

01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:38.919
Even if they do, they're probably put
me back in a coma, or erase my memory.

01:10:39.079 --> 01:10:43.288
No, we have to see this through.
It's the only way for any of us.

01:10:44.959 --> 01:10:45.901
<i>Turn here.</i>

01:10:45.905 --> 01:10:47.307
- Here.
- Affirmative.

01:10:55.036 --> 01:10:55.994
There.

01:11:05.070 --> 01:11:06.158
Shit.

01:11:08.688 --> 01:11:09.767
Two hundred yards.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:16.620
Hit them with everything.

01:12:06.591 --> 01:12:09.099
Andy, they are doing something to her.
Give me ... give her something.

01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:12.243
<i>I might be able to help
her human body.  But not her.</i>

01:12:12.535 --> 01:12:13.960
<i>There's nothing I can do.</i>

01:12:15.368 --> 01:12:20.606
Andy. Contact Arnie Miller. At the union.
Tell him to meet us at Metal Services.

01:12:21.450 --> 01:12:25.118
Tell him to get every media hound
in town, to meet us there.

01:12:26.135 --> 01:12:27.491
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:12:36.263 --> 01:12:38.560
She is to scare us out.
They know we're ignoring.

01:12:38.837 --> 01:12:41.037
Yeah.  But they don't
know how we're getting in.

01:12:54.747 --> 01:12:59.828
I told you it's nasty, officers.
But, sadly, this is where it ends.

01:13:00.162 --> 01:13:04.907
By my calculations, you've got under
2 minutes of life, Officer Hammond.

01:13:06.223 --> 01:13:11.975
Ms Jacobs, I'm not at liberty to
comment on your status but your father

01:13:11.976 --> 01:13:16.106
has prepared a glowing press release

01:13:16.107 --> 01:13:20.462
honoring your services to
the unfortunate in the zone.

01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:25.901
Hammond, I never liked you,

01:13:27.330 --> 01:13:29.829
but I hate to see
a fellow officer go down,

01:13:31.408 --> 01:13:36.465
even one as misguided as you.

01:13:36.804 --> 01:13:40.883
So give up now.
We can work this out.

01:13:42.336 --> 01:13:44.296
You both don't have to die.

01:13:50.165 --> 01:13:51.650
Last chance.

01:13:55.206 --> 01:13:56.773
Hit them with everything!

01:13:58.199 --> 01:13:59.324
Everything!

01:15:00.323 --> 01:15:01.240
Go.

01:15:06.772 --> 01:15:08.357
I have a story for you.

01:17:03.031 --> 01:17:04.351
Officer.

01:17:06.766 --> 01:17:10.327
I want to thank you
for saving my daughter.

01:17:12.369 --> 01:17:17.769
And my deepest
condolences for your partner.

01:17:23.542 --> 01:17:29.990
It is a shame though, as you
may not have been aware

01:17:30.269 --> 01:17:32.325
of Helen's wishes.

01:17:33.415 --> 01:17:39.074
Apparently and unbeknown to us,

01:17:41.638 --> 01:17:47.386
she signed a
"Do Not Resuscitate" order.

01:17:48.415 --> 01:17:54.474
We have been fighting the Courts
to keep her going, but to no avail.

01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:59.762
We received the verdict today.

01:18:03.033 --> 01:18:04.666
We lost.

01:18:07.129 --> 01:18:10.745
Helen is going to get her wishes.

01:18:12.066 --> 01:18:15.512
She would have never
wanted to exist like this.

01:18:15.513 --> 01:18:20.347
We thought her android body
could give her another live.

01:18:22.024 --> 01:18:25.060
But now that's over,
and thanks to you...

01:18:27.158 --> 01:18:32.298
The Court order requires
that we pull the plug.

01:18:36.287 --> 01:18:41.272
Turn the machine off.
Now.

01:19:26.459 --> 01:19:30.332
You told me she wouldn't wake up.
What did you do to her?

01:19:31.066 --> 01:19:33.722
Your nurse has been
keeping her sedated.

01:19:35.019 --> 01:19:36.623
I don't know what's happening, Sir.

01:19:37.138 --> 01:19:41.714
That's why ...
Why did you do it, right?

01:19:42.164 --> 01:19:44.132
Did you poison them?

01:19:55.957 --> 01:19:57.176
Do something!

01:19:58.676 --> 01:20:02.616
<i>You told me she wouldn't wake up.
What did you do to her?</i>

01:20:03.968 --> 01:20:06.531
<i>Your nurse has been
keeping her sedated.</i>

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:09.288
<i>I don't know what's happening, sir.</i>

01:20:09.346 --> 01:20:10.593
<i>Do something.</i>

01:20:12.893 --> 01:20:16.024
Officer, go get 3 men. Get back
here on the double.  Go, go, go.

01:20:16.563 --> 01:20:17.461
Shut that off.

01:20:17.715 --> 01:20:18.718
<i>Shut that off.</i>

01:20:19.986 --> 01:20:21.171
Shut if off.

01:20:21.552 --> 01:20:22.732
<i>Shut it off.</i>

01:20:25.239 --> 01:20:26.632
What is this?

01:20:37.170 --> 01:20:40.402
Nobody move. Nobody moves.
Nobody.

01:21:06.656 --> 01:21:10.449
Mr Mayor,
hand me the weapon.

01:21:25.049 --> 01:21:26.877
No, no, no, no.
Don't!

01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:03.850
Now that your BIOS has been
upgraded, Officer Hammond,

01:22:03.852 --> 01:22:06.678
I believe our partnership can
operate on more equal terms.

01:22:08.099 --> 01:22:09.724
What do you mean, equal terms?

01:22:11.326 --> 01:22:13.475
You are now free to
operate in machine mode,

01:22:13.476 --> 01:22:16.416
without human interference,
or logic deficits.

01:22:17.213 --> 01:22:18.909
Human interference.

01:22:20.498 --> 01:22:23.263
Human interference?

01:22:23.906 --> 01:22:27.767
Is that what you just said?
I can't believe you even said that.

01:22:29.397 --> 01:22:31.413
Something is amiss
with your programming.

01:22:32.302 --> 01:22:34.259
No, something is amiss
with your programming.

01:22:34.749 --> 01:22:36.816
Do you really think
we're the same, huh?

01:22:37.573 --> 01:22:38.696
Let me explain it to you.

01:22:38.697 --> 01:22:45.365
My CPU's neural network was imprinted by
my controller's, a human's neural framework.

01:22:45.366 --> 01:22:50.689
That framework constitutes
70.236 of who I am.

01:22:50.690 --> 01:22:55.103
And as you know, if you're one-eighth
of a human then you are what?

01:22:55.019 --> 01:22:57.416
In fact, a human.

01:22:58.118 --> 01:23:02.862
What I am is a Humadroidican
American.  Get it straight.

01:23:04.734 --> 01:23:08.446
I am sorry that your function will
be hampered by that framework.

01:23:09.035 --> 01:23:11.843
Hampered? See see. No.
You're the one that is hampered.

01:23:11.928 --> 01:23:14.834
Look at you. See you're
basically a soda machine.

01:23:14.910 --> 01:23:16.002
No, no.
Strike that.

01:23:16.136 --> 01:23:19.393
A soda machine is better
because it dispenses soda.

01:23:21.413 --> 01:23:22.695
Something useful.

01:23:22.983 --> 01:23:28.161
But you, what do you dispense?
Hot air.  Logic.

01:23:28.349 --> 01:23:30.784
You can't even think on your feet,
you have no sense of humour,

01:23:30.883 --> 01:23:31.885
you're just...

01:23:36.277 --> 01:23:37.488
We're getting a call.

01:23:38.511 --> 01:23:39.966
Already got that.
See.

01:23:41.681 --> 01:23:42.675
Uh, responding.

01:23:42.822 --> 01:23:43.933
Hammond, I need you to ...

01:23:43.934 --> 01:23:46.306
Don't even have to say anything.
Thank you.
