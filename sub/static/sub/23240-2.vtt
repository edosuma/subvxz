WEBVTT

00:03.900 --> 00:06.367
PREVIOUSLY ON "I AM JAZZ"...

00:06.367 --> 00:09.933
We obviously want this
to really be the best surgery

00:09.933 --> 00:11.500
it could possibly be.

00:11.500 --> 00:14.667
What I'd like to do is just
have you come see me again.

00:14.667 --> 00:16.767
I AM TOTALLY SHOCKED
THAT WE HAVE TO GO OUT

00:16.767 --> 00:18.967
TO CALIFORNIA AGAIN
TO SEE DR. BOWERS.

00:18.967 --> 00:20.533
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
GETTING THE SURGERY, LIKE,

00:20.533 --> 00:21.700
A YEAR FROM NOW,

00:21.700 --> 00:24.200
AND NOW, DAD THINKS
I'M NOT MATURE ENOUGH

00:24.200 --> 00:26.233
TO HAVE THIS BOTTOM SURGERY.

00:26.233 --> 00:28.500
-NOPE.

00:28.500 --> 00:29.900
OH, MY GOD.

00:29.900 --> 00:32.167
JAZZ! THIS IS ALL, LIKE,
TAKEOUT FOOD.

00:32.167 --> 00:35.533
MY EATING HABITS ARE...
ARE A REAL PROBLEM.

00:35.533 --> 00:37.167
WE'RE ON THE PLANE RIGHT NOW,

00:37.167 --> 00:39.633
HEADING TO THE PHILADELPHIA
TRANS HEALTH CONFERENCE,

00:39.633 --> 00:43.267
AND DAD IS STUCK AT HOME
WITH HURRICANE IRMA ON ITS WAY.

00:43.267 --> 00:46.033
Man:
185-MILE-PER-HOUR WINDS.

00:46.033 --> 00:47.667
ALL RIGHT, WE NEED
TO CALL DAD REAL FAST.

00:49.767 --> 00:52.267
Hi, this is Greg.
You've reached my voice mail.

00:53.667 --> 00:56.467
Jazz: 16 YEARS AGO,
I WAS ASSIGNED MALE AT BIRTH,

00:56.467 --> 00:59.067
BUT INSIDE,
I ALWAYS KNEW I WAS A GIRL.

00:59.067 --> 01:01.600
I HAVE A GIRL BRAIN
AND A BOY BODY.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.067
BEING TRANSGENDER
HASN'T BEEN EASY...

01:04.067 --> 01:06.233
WE REALLY ARE WALKING
A TIGHTROPE.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.300
-I'M A TOUGH CASE.
-YOU'RE A TOUGH CASE.

01:08.300 --> 01:09.433
-COME ON, JAZZ!
-WHOO!

01:09.433 --> 01:11.833
GO FOR IT, GIRL!

01:11.833 --> 01:13.900
...BUT IT'S MADE ME WHO I AM.

01:13.900 --> 01:15.333
I AM JAZZ.

01:21.333 --> 01:23.067
Man: IN PARTS
OF THE FLORIDA KEYS,

01:23.067 --> 01:27.500
IRMA'S WRATH IS VISIBLE
AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.767
FEMA ESTIMATES NEARLY
A QUARTER OF THE HOMES HERE

01:29.767 --> 01:31.067
HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.

01:31.067 --> 01:34.633
WATER, FOOD, GAS, AND POWER
REMAIN TOP PRIORITIES.

01:34.633 --> 01:36.433
THE LARGEST
POWER RESTORATION EFFORT

01:36.433 --> 01:39.867
IN THE UNITED STATES' HISTORY
IS NOW UNDERWAY.

01:41.933 --> 01:43.567
Jazz: WOW.
I CAN'T BELIEVE...

01:43.567 --> 01:44.633
Jeanette:
YOU SEE ALL THE TREES?

01:44.633 --> 01:46.233
OUR NEIGHBORHOOD LOOKS
TERRIBLE.

01:46.233 --> 01:49.367
-THIS IS REALLY BAD.
-I KNOW.

01:49.367 --> 01:52.067
Jeanette: JAZZ AND I ARE JUST
MAKING IT BACK TO FLORIDA

01:52.067 --> 01:53.267
FROM PHILLY.

01:53.267 --> 01:55.767
FORTUNATELY, I WAS ABLE
TO CONNECT WITH GREG

01:55.767 --> 01:58.833
AND THE OTHER KIDS, MY PARENTS,
TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE SAFE.

01:58.833 --> 02:01.233
LIKE, THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD,
JUST LOOK DOWN THERE.

02:01.233 --> 02:03.567
-IT'S SO BAD.

02:03.567 --> 02:05.267
Jeanette:
I KNEW WE GOT HIT PRETTY HARD,

02:05.267 --> 02:09.533
BUT WHEN I'D SEE ALL THE DEBRIS,
IT -- THIS WAS BAD.

02:09.533 --> 02:11.767
I'M KIND OF IN SHOCK.

02:11.767 --> 02:14.133
**

02:14.133 --> 02:16.300
ALL THE FURNITURE
IS INSIDE.

02:16.300 --> 02:18.500
OH, LOOK AT YOUR SOCCER NET.

02:18.500 --> 02:19.667
LOOKS LIKE WE MISSED A LOT.

02:19.667 --> 02:20.967
GOD. DID YOU CARRY THIS
ALL INSIDE?

02:20.967 --> 02:23.433
I DID. YEAH.
I COULD HAVE USED SOME HELP.

02:23.433 --> 02:25.967
Jazz: THE HOUSE IS NOT IN
ITS BEST CONDITION.

02:25.967 --> 02:29.667
THE INSIDE HAS EVERYTHING
THAT USED TO BE OUTSIDE.

02:29.667 --> 02:34.067
BUT I'M VERY RELIEVED THAT
MY DAD AND MY HOME IS SAFE.

02:34.067 --> 02:35.733
HOW DID THE NEIGHBORHOOD LOOK
WHEN YOU DROVE THROUGH?

02:35.733 --> 02:37.467
-OH, MY GOD. IT LOOKS AWFUL.
-IT LOOKS TERRIBLE.

02:37.467 --> 02:39.933
I THINK WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE,
WHERE WE LIVE.

02:39.933 --> 02:44.067
ALTHOUGH, YOU WANT TO SEE
THE DAMAGE OUT BACK?

02:44.067 --> 02:46.067
-YEAH, I DO.

02:46.067 --> 02:47.700
IS IT BAD?

02:47.700 --> 02:49.967
IT'S -- IT'S, UH...

02:49.967 --> 02:52.667
I'LL LET YOU BE THE JUDGE.

02:52.667 --> 02:56.067
Jeanette: WE'VE LIVED THROUGH
SOME PRETTY POWERFUL HURRICANES,

02:56.067 --> 02:57.600
BUT THIS WAS RECORD-BREAKING.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.133
THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS
AMOUNT OF GUILT

02:59.133 --> 03:01.133
LEAVING GREG ALONE.

03:01.133 --> 03:02.900
I WAS SCARED
FOR MY OTHER KIDS.

03:02.900 --> 03:04.833
IT WAS A HORRIBLE FEELING.

03:06.067 --> 03:08.933
OH, MY GOD.

03:08.933 --> 03:10.667
-Jeanette: OH, MY GOD.
-WHAT THE...

03:10.667 --> 03:13.433
JEEZ!
Jazz: THAT WAS MY FAVORITE TREE!

03:13.433 --> 03:16.500
WHOA!

03:16.500 --> 03:17.833
-THAT HAMMOCK...
-HOLY...

03:17.833 --> 03:19.800
...IS NOT LOOKING
TOO COZY ANYMORE, HUH?

03:19.800 --> 03:23.067
Greg: THERE'S A FEW LESSONS TO
TAKE AWAY FROM THIS EXPERIENCE.

03:23.067 --> 03:25.133
MOTHER NATURE
DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE.

03:25.133 --> 03:26.733
IT JUST DOESN'T CARE.

03:26.733 --> 03:30.367
AND SHE CAN BE QUITE AWESOME
AND QUITE DEVASTATING.

03:30.367 --> 03:32.100
YOU NEED TO BE PREPARED.

03:32.100 --> 03:35.067
AND THE OTHER THING --
LOVE YOUR FAMILY.

03:35.067 --> 03:37.067
Jeanette: I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU WERE HERE ALONE.

03:37.067 --> 03:38.533
WELL, THE HOUSE WASN'T
PREPARED, YOU KNOW.

03:38.533 --> 03:39.900
IT WASN'T READY
FOR THE STORM.

03:39.900 --> 03:42.467
I WAS REALLY WATCHING THE STORM,
AND I WAS GOING TO DECIDE

03:42.467 --> 03:44.100
WHETHER OR NOT
IT MADE SENSE TO LEAVE.

03:44.100 --> 03:46.567
WITH ALL OF YOU GUYS OUT
OF THE HOUSE, THOUGH,

03:46.567 --> 03:48.967
I JUST FELT IT WAS OKAY.

03:48.967 --> 03:52.167
I FELT LIKE IT WAS MY DUTY
TO STAY HOME

03:52.167 --> 03:54.567
AND MAKE SURE THAT
THE HOUSE WAS IN ORDER,

03:54.567 --> 03:56.300
BUT IT WAS
KIND OF UNNERVING

03:56.300 --> 03:59.833
BECAUSE THE NEWS
WAS PRETTY SEVERE.

03:59.833 --> 04:01.600
THIS COULD HAVE BEEN FAR WORSE.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.567
IT COULD HAVE BEEN
SO MUCH WORSE.

04:03.567 --> 04:05.767
WE'RE LUCKY WE DID NOT
GET THE WORST OF IT.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.933
WE REALLY DODGED A BULLET
ON THIS ONE.

04:07.933 --> 04:12.100
WE'VE HEARD THAT 25%
OF THE HOMES IN THE KEYS

04:12.100 --> 04:13.633
ARE ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED.

04:13.633 --> 04:15.833
THERE'S PEOPLE THAT CAN'T EVEN
GET BACK TO THEIR HOUSE.

04:15.833 --> 04:18.733
THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT
ARE HOMELESS RIGHT NOW.

04:18.733 --> 04:20.067
IT'S REALLY SAD.

04:20.067 --> 04:22.367
YOU WANT TO HELP ME START
MOVING STUFF FROM INSIDE?

04:22.367 --> 04:23.700
SURE.

04:23.700 --> 04:25.800
Jeanette: FIRST, I WANT TO MAKE
SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS GOOD,

04:25.800 --> 04:27.233
MY KIDS, MY PARENTS.

04:27.233 --> 04:29.733
I'M A MAMA BEAR WHO WORRIES
ABOUT HER CUBS,

04:29.733 --> 04:32.633
AND IT WAS HORRIBLE
KNOWING THAT MY KIDS

04:32.633 --> 04:36.867
ARE NOT IN SAFE PLACES AT ALL,
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.

04:38.333 --> 04:39.800
Jazz: HE'S CONNECTING.

04:41.767 --> 04:43.567
-HEY.
-HI!

04:43.567 --> 04:44.733
HEY, GRIFFEN.

04:44.733 --> 04:47.667
Jeanette: THE LAST TIME
I SPOKE TO THE KIDS,

04:47.667 --> 04:49.233
IRMA WAS HEADED
IN THEIR DIRECTION,

04:49.233 --> 04:51.067
AND I WAS
SUPER, SUPER WORRIED.

04:51.067 --> 04:52.167
IS THAT ARI?

04:52.167 --> 04:54.267
GET CLOSER.
I CAN'T SEE YOU ALL.

04:54.267 --> 04:55.767
-Jeanette: WAIT A MINUTE.
-Greg: THERE'S SANDER.

04:55.767 --> 04:56.933
SANDER.

04:56.933 --> 04:58.100
IT LOOKS LIKE
HE'S STILL SLEEPING.

04:58.100 --> 04:59.700
WAIT. GO BACK TO SANDER.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.667
NOW THAT I GET TO SEE
THEIR BEAUTIFUL FACES,

05:02.667 --> 05:05.067
I FEEL
SUCH A SENSE OF RELIEF

05:05.067 --> 05:08.133
BECAUSE THEY TOOK
THE HURRICANE VERY LIGHTLY.

05:08.133 --> 05:10.467
SO HOW DID YOU GUYS MAKE OUT
IN THE HURRICANE?

05:13.067 --> 05:14.200
Jazz: OH, MY GOD.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.567
Greg: IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE STILL SLEEPING.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.933
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
WHERE WERE YOU SLEEPING?

05:20.467 --> 05:22.500
YOU WERE IN YOUR UNDERLOFT?

05:24.067 --> 05:25.433
SAYS WHO?

05:30.167 --> 05:33.600
WHAT WAS IT WHEN IT HIT YOU?
WHAT CATEGORY?

05:33.600 --> 05:34.867
OH.

05:38.633 --> 05:42.167
ALL THE TREES
IN OUR BACKYARD FELL.

05:42.167 --> 05:43.533
NO, NOT ALL OF THEM,

05:43.533 --> 05:45.633
BUT, LIKE, A LOT OF TREES
IN THE BACKYARD FELL.

05:45.633 --> 05:49.067
NOTHING HIT THE HOUSE.

05:49.067 --> 05:51.067
NO, NO.
THE HOUSE WAS GOOD.

05:51.067 --> 05:53.267
I HATED BEING AWAY
FROM ALL OF YOU.

05:53.267 --> 05:55.767
WE WERE ALL VERY LUCKY.
THAT'S ALL I COULD SAY.

05:55.767 --> 05:57.100
-Greg: WE LOVE YOU GUYS.
-Jeanette: WE LOVE YOU.

05:57.100 --> 05:59.500
-GO BACK TO SLEEP.
-MWAH!

05:59.500 --> 06:02.233
-MWAH, MWAH, MWAH.
-ALL RIGHT. TAKE CARE.

06:02.233 --> 06:04.200
-BYE.
-TALK TO YOU SOON.

06:04.200 --> 06:05.367
Jazz: BEEP.

06:05.367 --> 06:09.400
THEY LOOKED...
LIKE THEY WERE OKAY.

06:09.400 --> 06:12.967
Jeanette: A PART OF ME
IS STILL SOMEWHAT ANNOYED

06:12.967 --> 06:15.533
FOR NOT TAKING
THE STORM MORE SERIOUS.

06:15.533 --> 06:17.233
THEY NEEDED TO BE
IN SHELTERS.

06:17.233 --> 06:18.767
THEY WERE JUST GOING TO DO
WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO

06:18.767 --> 06:20.433
AND WEREN'T GOING
TO LISTEN TO ME.

06:20.433 --> 06:24.067
SO I'M GRATEFUL AND FEEL BLESSED
THAT EVERYBODY IS OKAY.

06:25.800 --> 06:34.800
**

06:34.867 --> 06:40.800
**

06:40.800 --> 06:43.133
-Jazz: OH, THERE SHE IS.
-OH, HEY.

06:43.133 --> 06:46.367
TODAY, I'M SHOPPING WITH
ONE OF MY GREAT FRIENDS, JAY.

06:46.367 --> 06:48.067
I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE OKAY.

06:48.067 --> 06:50.767
YEAH. WE LOST POWER FOR A DAY,
BUT WE'RE ALL GOOD.

06:50.767 --> 06:52.633
BOOM.

06:52.633 --> 06:54.733
Jazz: IT'S KIND OF HARD TO
GET BACK TO YOUR NORMAL LIFE

06:54.733 --> 06:57.267
AFTER SOMETHING
SO BIG JUST OCCURRED,

06:57.267 --> 07:01.067
BUT I ALSO NEED TO JUST
RECONNECT WITH MY FRIENDS.

07:01.067 --> 07:04.200
YOU KNOW WHAT I REALLY LIKE?
I LIKE THAT COLOR UP HERE.

07:04.200 --> 07:05.400
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.567
I FEEL LIKE IT'S A CUTE
BATHING SUIT COLOR.

07:06.567 --> 07:08.067
IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.

07:08.067 --> 07:09.367
WHY IS IT SO LOW?

07:09.367 --> 07:12.967
-I FEEL IT WOULD GO BELOW...

07:12.967 --> 07:14.667
I STILL HATE SHOPPING.

07:14.667 --> 07:16.567
IT'S NOT ONE OF
MY FAVORITE THINGS TO DO.

07:16.567 --> 07:19.333
-NOW WE'RE GOOD.
-Jazz: NO, GET A THIRD ONE.

07:19.333 --> 07:22.133
UNFORTUNATELY I'M GOING
TO A WATER PARK,

07:22.133 --> 07:25.267
AND I'M NOT EXACTLY IN THE BODY
THAT I WANT TO BE IN.

07:25.267 --> 07:27.600
-Jazz: THE BELLY.
-OKAY. AROUND THE WAIST.

07:27.600 --> 07:30.933
BUT I GOTTA GET MY BATHING SUIT
SOME WAY, SO IT'S BEARABLE.

07:30.933 --> 07:33.067
I HATE THIS CUT, TOO.

07:33.067 --> 07:34.433
THIS CUT LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.

07:34.433 --> 07:36.067
IT'S, LIKE, "REALLY?
YOU WANT TO OPEN IT UP

07:36.067 --> 07:40.167
TO FRICKING MUMBO JUMBO
WHALE BLUBBER RIGHT THERE?"

07:40.167 --> 07:42.167
I HAVE NOT BEEN
EATING HEALTHY AT ALL.

07:42.167 --> 07:43.333
OH, MY GOSH.

07:43.333 --> 07:44.567
LIKE, THE OTHER DAY,
MY MOM FOUND ME

07:44.567 --> 07:46.133
WITH A CROCK-POT
IN MY ROOM,

07:46.133 --> 07:50.400
AND I WAS EATING, LIKE, CHIPS
AND THIS BUFFALO CHICKEN DIP.

07:50.400 --> 07:53.433
-OH, MY GOSH.
-IT WAS SO YUMMY.

07:53.433 --> 07:56.533
I NEED TO FIND SOMETHING THAT,
LIKE, COVERS MY WHOLE BODY,

07:56.533 --> 07:59.333
WITH A SKIRT,
WITH A COVER-UP ON TOP.

07:59.333 --> 08:00.767
NO SKIRT.
I DON'T WANT --

08:00.767 --> 08:02.600
-DID YOU FORGET ABOUT...
-YEAH.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.267
...A LITTLE SOMETHING
BETWEEN MY LEGS THAT...

08:04.267 --> 08:05.633
I KNOW.

08:05.633 --> 08:06.967
Jaylen: IT'S HARD FOR
ANY TEENAGE GIRL TO JUST, LIKE,

08:06.967 --> 08:08.833
PUT ON, LIKE, A SWIMSUIT
AND JUST GO OUT THERE.

08:08.833 --> 08:11.567
IT MUST BE EVEN HARDER FOR JAZZ
BEING THAT DOWN THERE

08:11.567 --> 08:14.533
DOESN'T NECESSARILY MATCH
WHAT IS UP HERE.

08:14.533 --> 08:15.800
WHAT ELSE
DO YOU HAVE PLANNED?

08:15.800 --> 08:17.900
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING, LIKE,
EXCITING COMING UP?

08:17.900 --> 08:20.967
WELL, I'M HAVING
A FOLLOW-UP CONSULTATION.

08:20.967 --> 08:24.867
I'M SEEING MY SURGEON,
DR. MARCI BOWERS, NEXT WEEK.

08:24.867 --> 08:28.200
I THINK IT'S JUST KIND OF TO GO
IN-DEPTH ABOUT THE NEXT STEPS

08:28.200 --> 08:30.067
WE NEED TO TAKE
BEFORE I GET MY PROCEDURE.

08:30.067 --> 08:31.833
SO IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING
SIMPLE, LIKE,

08:31.833 --> 08:34.067
SCHEDULING THE DATE, PLANNING,
EVERYTHING LIKE THAT.

08:34.067 --> 08:35.967
WOW. LIKE, YOU'RE AT
THAT STEP ALREADY,

08:35.967 --> 08:37.400
WHERE, LIKE,
YOU'RE SCHEDULING?

08:37.400 --> 08:40.567
WELL, YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU HAVE
TO PREPARE, LIKE, A YEAR BEFORE.

08:40.567 --> 08:42.100
Jaylen: I REMEMBER
WHEN SHE FIRST STARTED

08:42.100 --> 08:43.267
HER HORMONE IMPLANTS,

08:43.267 --> 08:45.267
AND I FEEL LIKE THAT
WAS JUST YESTERDAY,

08:45.267 --> 08:47.100
AND NOW WE'RE INTO OUR
JUNIOR YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL,

08:47.100 --> 08:50.067
AND SHE'S GETTING SURGERY,
AND IT'S JUST GOING BY SO FAST.

08:50.067 --> 08:51.567
MY FIRST CONSULTATION
WITH HER,

08:51.567 --> 08:54.800
SHE SAID THAT SHE COULD TOTALLY
DO THE STANDARD VAGINOPLASTY,

08:54.800 --> 08:59.833
ONE STEP, BUT SHE DID SAY
SHE HAS SOMETHING TO REVEAL.

08:59.833 --> 09:02.933
Jazz: I'M EXCITED, BUT I'M ALSO
A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS

09:02.933 --> 09:04.233
TO HEAR WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY

09:04.233 --> 09:07.300
BECAUSE HER FaceTime CALL
WAS SO CRYPTIC.

09:07.300 --> 09:09.067
WE'VE HAD SO MANY BUMPS
IN THE ROAD.

09:09.067 --> 09:12.267
I JUST -- I FEEL LIKE
IT DESERVES TO GO SMOOTHLY.

09:12.267 --> 09:15.733
**

09:15.733 --> 09:17.067
-YES.

09:17.067 --> 09:18.367
READY FOR YOU.

09:18.367 --> 09:21.367
FEELING A LITTLE ANXIOUS
WALKING INTO DR. BOWERS' OFFICE.

09:21.367 --> 09:23.767
I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP
WITH YOU IN PERSON.

09:23.767 --> 09:26.300
NOT TO BRING UP
THE BAD NEWS FIRST, BUT...

09:26.300 --> 09:29.867
**

09:31.400 --> 09:38.067
**

09:38.067 --> 09:40.500
HERE, I'LL EVEN
GET YOUR CHAIR FOR YOU.

09:40.500 --> 09:41.567
OH, BOY. THANK YOU.

09:41.567 --> 09:43.433
I THINK THAT DESERVES
A LITTLE...

09:43.433 --> 09:45.267
I DID A LIPSTICK KISS,
AIR KISS.

09:45.267 --> 09:47.733
Greg: HAVING A MOMENT
LIKE THIS WITH JEANETTE

09:47.733 --> 09:50.833
AFTER
A NATURAL DISASTER IS...

09:50.833 --> 09:52.067
IT'S IMPORTANT.

09:52.067 --> 09:53.200
IT'S SIGNIFICANT,
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:53.200 --> 09:55.067
NOT EVERYBODY WAS SO LUCKY.

09:56.300 --> 09:57.467
-SHOOT. YOU DID THAT ON PURPOSE.

09:57.467 --> 09:59.333
-NO.
-YES, YOU DID.

09:59.333 --> 10:02.367
IT JUST MAKES YOU APPRECIATE
HOW FRAGILE LIFE IS.

10:02.367 --> 10:03.833
YOUR LOVED ONES ARE SAFE,

10:03.833 --> 10:07.400
AND YOUR POSSESSIONS,
YOU KNOW, AREN'T ALL GONE.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.267
-I AM GONNA EAT.

10:09.267 --> 10:12.633
I'VE LEARNED THAT IF YOU EAT
SLOWER, YOU WON'T EAT AS MUCH.

10:12.633 --> 10:19.933
**

10:21.267 --> 10:24.833
**

10:24.833 --> 10:25.933
OKAY.

10:25.933 --> 10:29.200
DO I HAVE FOOD ON MY MOUTH?

10:29.200 --> 10:33.133
WELL, YOU MAY OR MAY NOT
HAVE SOMETHING ON YOUR CHIN.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.100
-SO...
-THIS IS SO GOOD.

10:35.100 --> 10:38.167
I'M SO HUNGRY BECAUSE
I CUT DOWN ALL THOSE TREES.

10:38.167 --> 10:39.433
-YEAH.

10:39.433 --> 10:40.833
WELL, SPEAKING OF CUTTING
DOWN TREES, YOU KNOW,

10:40.833 --> 10:43.867
THE KEYS GOT IT REAL BAD,

10:43.867 --> 10:46.767
AND I THINK IT WOULD BE NICE
IF WE WENT TO THE KEYS,

10:46.767 --> 10:50.067
AND WE HELPED A FAMILY GET
THEIR HOUSE BACK TOGETHER.

10:50.067 --> 10:51.733
THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM
FOR VOLUNTEERS.

10:51.733 --> 10:54.633
PEOPLE ALWAYS NEED HELP
WHEN THERE'S A SITUATION

10:54.633 --> 10:56.600
LIKE A NATURAL DISASTER.

10:56.600 --> 10:59.400
THERE ARE DIFFERENT
VOLUNTEER GROUPS

10:59.400 --> 11:00.867
THAT ARE HEADED
TO THE KEYS,

11:00.867 --> 11:02.633
AND WE NEED
TO PAY IT FORWARD

11:02.633 --> 11:05.567
'CAUSE WE DID NOT GET THE WORST
OF IT, BUT OTHERS DID.

11:05.567 --> 11:06.833
I THINK THAT WOULD BE
A GREAT THING.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.133
I THINK IT WOULD BE
A GOOD EXPERIENCE FOR JAZZ.

11:09.133 --> 11:11.067
IF YOU COULD FIND A FAMILY
THAT HAS THE NEED,

11:11.067 --> 11:13.700
ME, YOU, AND JAZZ
COULD GO HELP OUT.

11:13.700 --> 11:16.200
JAZZ HASN'T HAD IT EASY
BY ANY MEANS,

11:16.200 --> 11:20.567
BUT SHE'S NEVER SEEN SOMEBODY
WHO HAS LOST EVERYTHING,

11:20.567 --> 11:21.933
AND I THINK SOMETIMES,
YOU KNOW,

11:21.933 --> 11:23.967
SHE TAKES FOR GRANTED
HOW LUCKY SHE IS,

11:23.967 --> 11:26.167
AND THIS WILL PUT THINGS
IN PERSPECTIVE FOR HER.

11:26.167 --> 11:28.367
SO LET'S GO BACKWARDS.

11:28.367 --> 11:31.767
I'M THINKING ABOUT
THIS FaceTime FROM DR. BOWERS,

11:31.767 --> 11:34.667
SAYING THAT WE NEED
TO COME OUT TO CALIFORNIA.

11:34.667 --> 11:36.367
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

11:36.367 --> 11:39.700
I MEAN, WE'VE BEEN ON
SO MANY CONSULTS.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.333
Jeanette: I DON'T EVEN CONSIDER
THIS A PRE-OP CONSULTATION

11:42.333 --> 11:44.133
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE
TO FLY TO CALIFORNIA

11:44.133 --> 11:47.233
FOR A PRE-OP CONSULTATION,
SO IT'S A MYSTERY.

11:47.233 --> 11:48.633
LIKE, WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:48.633 --> 11:52.167
-YES.

11:52.167 --> 11:53.767
SHE WOULDN'T ASK US
TO GO BACK OUT

11:53.767 --> 11:55.400
IF IT WASN'T REALLY IMPORTANT,
AND I'M ASSUMING SHE NEEDS...

11:55.400 --> 11:56.567
THIS BETTER BE
REALLY IMPORTANT.

11:56.567 --> 11:58.733
SHE WANTS TO PROBABLY
EXAMINE JAZZ AGAIN.

11:58.733 --> 12:01.367
-NOT REALLY.

12:01.367 --> 12:03.867
-I MEAN...
-SHE NEEDED TO TALK TO US.

12:03.867 --> 12:05.600
I WOULD HAVE ASKED
A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.900
WE ASKED A FEW. SHE WASN'T
GONNA GIVE ANSWERS.

12:07.900 --> 12:09.100
I JUST -- YOU KNOW WHEN
YOU KNOW SOMEBODY'S NOT GONNA

12:09.100 --> 12:10.333
TELL YOU UNTIL YOU'RE THERE,

12:10.333 --> 12:12.367
AND YOU MIGHT AS WELL NOT EVEN
GO THERE AND ASK THEM?

12:12.367 --> 12:16.200
BUT "THERE" IS ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.633
I DON'T KNOW, GREG.

12:17.633 --> 12:21.133
Greg: IT'S A BIT UNEXPECTED
THAT DR. BOWERS HAS INDICATED

12:21.133 --> 12:22.933
THAT SHE WANTS US
TO COME BACK OUT

12:22.933 --> 12:25.067
TO CALIFORNIA
THIS COMING WEEK.

12:25.067 --> 12:27.533
I THOUGHT WE HAD
GOTTEN TO THE POINT

12:27.533 --> 12:31.567
WHERE SHE HAD EXAMINED JAZZ,
EVERYTHING WAS SET.

12:31.567 --> 12:35.100
ALL WE NEEDED TO DO WAS REALLY
COME UP WITH A SURGICAL DATE

12:35.100 --> 12:38.533
AND THEN GO BACK OUT TO
CALIFORNIA TO HAVE THE SURGERY.

12:38.533 --> 12:42.133
SO AT THIS POINT,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS.

12:42.133 --> 12:44.100
NOTHING IS EASY, YOU KNOW?

12:44.100 --> 12:46.300
EVEN WHEN IT WAS HARD
TO GET THERE,

12:46.300 --> 12:47.867
WE GET THERE,
AND IT'S STILL HARD.

12:47.867 --> 12:51.500
I FEEL LIKE WE ARE, LIKE,
OPENING UP PANDORA'S BOX AGAIN.

12:51.500 --> 12:59.833
**

12:59.900 --> 13:05.633
**

13:05.633 --> 13:06.733
HEY. WHAT'S UP?

13:06.733 --> 13:08.700
HEY THERE, GOOD FRIEND.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.633
GOOD FRIEND OF MINE.

13:10.633 --> 13:12.467
I'M PICKING UP NOELLE
TO GO TO THE WATER PARK

13:12.467 --> 13:13.833
BECAUSE I'M JUST REALLY EAGER

13:13.833 --> 13:15.800
FOR ALL OF MY FRIENDS TO
MEET ONE ANOTHER.

13:15.800 --> 13:19.067
NOELLE WAS WITH ME IN PHILLY
DURING HURRICANE IRMA,

13:19.067 --> 13:21.267
AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
WE'RE SEEING EACH OTHER

13:21.267 --> 13:23.833
SINCE WE'VE GOTTEN BACK.

13:23.833 --> 13:25.200
HOW'S THE CLEANUP GOING?

13:25.200 --> 13:26.967
SO FAR, NOT TOO BAD.

13:26.967 --> 13:29.533
WE LOST OUR POWER,
BUT THAT WAS ABOUT IT.

13:29.533 --> 13:30.667
GOOD.

13:30.667 --> 13:32.267
I JUST WANT TO GET OUR MIND
OFF OF THE STORM

13:32.267 --> 13:34.067
AND JUST WANT EVERYONE
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME

13:34.067 --> 13:35.500
AND LOVE ONE ANOTHER.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.067
YOU'VE BEEN PULLING YOUR HAIR
BACK A LOT THOUGH.

13:37.067 --> 13:39.533
WHY DO YOU DO THAT?

13:39.533 --> 13:41.567
YEAH, I KNOW,
BUT IT'S JUST...

13:41.567 --> 13:44.133
IT'S...MY HAIR
GETS EVERYWHERE.

13:44.133 --> 13:46.533
YOU COULD ALWAYS GET BANGS.

13:46.533 --> 13:47.867
NO.

13:47.867 --> 13:50.433
Jazz: NOELLE HAS CHANGED A LOT
SINCE I FIRST MET HER,

13:50.433 --> 13:52.300
AND I FEEL LIKE
SHE'S MORE CONFIDENT

13:52.300 --> 13:53.900
AND SHE LOVES HERSELF MORE,

13:53.900 --> 13:56.533
AND SHE'S JUST GROWING INTO
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

13:56.533 --> 13:57.900
OH, THAT'S SO CORNY
FOR ME TO SAY

13:57.900 --> 13:59.633
'CAUSE SHE'S MY FRIEND,
BUT IT'S TRUE.

13:59.633 --> 14:01.500
I REALLY SEE HER EVOLVING.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.433
I'VE REACHED A POINT
IN MY TRANSITION

14:03.433 --> 14:06.900
WHERE I'M COMFORTABLE
GOING OUTSIDE

14:06.900 --> 14:08.467
WITHOUT DOING ALL THAT.

14:08.467 --> 14:09.967
YEAH. THAT'S GOOD.

14:09.967 --> 14:12.800
YOU WANT TO -- THAT -- THAT'S
WHAT EVERYONE SHOULD FEEL LIKE.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.233
Noelle: RECENTLY,
I'VE BEEN FEELING HAPPIER.

14:15.233 --> 14:16.733
I'VE BEEN FEELING BETTER.

14:16.733 --> 14:18.367
I'VE NOTICED I'VE BEEN GETTING
ALONG WITH MY PARENTS

14:18.367 --> 14:20.267
AND MY ENTIRE FAMILY MORE,

14:20.267 --> 14:24.267
AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT HAS
A LOT TO DO WITH MY TRANSITION.

14:24.267 --> 14:25.767
OVERALL, I JUST...

14:25.767 --> 14:28.800
I CAN'T THINK OF A TIME IN
MY LIFE WHEN I'VE BEEN HAPPIER.

14:28.800 --> 14:32.400
SOMEONE TOLD ME, THEY'RE LIKE,
"I KNOW WHAT'S OFF ABOUT YOU."

14:32.400 --> 14:33.667
AND I'M LIKE, "WHAT?"

14:33.667 --> 14:34.867
AND THEY'RE LIKE,
"YOU LOOK LIKE A LESBIAN."

14:34.867 --> 14:36.733
AND I'M LIKE, "YOU GOT ME."

14:36.733 --> 14:37.967
THAT'S GOOD.

14:37.967 --> 14:47.800
**

14:47.800 --> 14:49.267
THERE SHE IS!

14:49.267 --> 14:51.367
MICHAELA PAIGE.

14:51.367 --> 14:54.367
I'M JUST REALLY LOOKING FORWARD
TO HANGING OUT WITH MY FRIENDS

14:54.367 --> 14:56.333
BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T
MET MICHAELA.

14:56.333 --> 14:57.700
I GOT YOU.

14:57.700 --> 15:00.767
-OH! COME TO US.
-WHEE!

15:00.767 --> 15:04.567
I WANT THEM TO SEE HOW COOL
SHE IS, AND FEARLESS.

15:04.567 --> 15:06.067
-HI!
-WELL, THAT WORKS.

15:06.067 --> 15:07.333
WHAT'S UP

15:07.333 --> 15:09.900
Jazz: MICHAELA IS VERY
COMFORTABLE IN HER OWN SKIN.

15:09.900 --> 15:13.333
SHE'S CONFIDENT, AND SHE'S
LEARNED TO LOVE HERSELF,

15:13.333 --> 15:15.500
AND I ADMIRE HER FOR THAT.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.067
-HEY, GUYS.
-OH, HELLO.

15:17.067 --> 15:18.233
-OH, HEY.
-HI!

15:18.233 --> 15:19.400
YOU'RE HERE.
YOU'VE MADE IT.

15:19.400 --> 15:20.567
YEP. I MADE IT.

15:20.567 --> 15:22.067
THIS IS MY FRIEND
MICHAELA, BY THE WAY.

15:22.067 --> 15:23.567
-HI!
-HI, I'M JAY. NICE TO MEET YOU.

15:23.567 --> 15:24.733
NICE TO MEET YOU!

15:24.733 --> 15:26.500
HOW DID YOU AND JAZZ MEET?

15:26.500 --> 15:28.500
I GOT A CHANCE
TO MEET JAZZ, ACTUALLY,

15:28.500 --> 15:30.267
AT PALM BEACH PRIDE
DOWN HERE.

15:30.267 --> 15:31.667
YOU KNOW, WE JUST
KIND OF HIT IT OFF,

15:31.667 --> 15:33.800
AND WE HAVE
SIMILAR PLATFORMS.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.967
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY, LIKE,
SIMILAR PLATFORMS?

15:36.967 --> 15:39.433
ABOUT A YEAR AGO,
I LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN

15:39.433 --> 15:42.333
WHERE I GO INTO SCHOOLS
AND I TALK ABOUT,

15:42.333 --> 15:44.600
YOU KNOW, THE BULLYING
THAT I'VE GONE THROUGH.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.167
IN MIDDLE SCHOOL
AND HIGH SCHOOL,

15:46.167 --> 15:50.567
I BATTLED WITH BULIMIA,
I BATTLED WITH BODY DYSMORPHIA.

15:50.567 --> 15:53.167
FOR ME, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

15:53.167 --> 15:55.200
HOW I WAS GONNA FEEL
COMFORTABLE IN MY BODY.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.133
-YEAH.
-I CAN KIND OF SYMPATHIZE.

15:57.133 --> 15:58.700
WHEN I WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,
I WAS, LIKE,

15:58.700 --> 16:00.367
REALLY, REALLY OVERWEIGHT,

16:00.367 --> 16:03.267
AND I WAS BULLIED TO NO END
ABOUT IT,

16:03.267 --> 16:06.633
AND IT'S, LIKE,
THAT STAYS WITH YOU.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.800
-Michaela: FOREVER.
-Jaylen: IT DOES.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.533
LIKE, I WILL NEVER BE
THAT KID

16:09.533 --> 16:12.500
WHO WASN'T CALLED FAT
OR ANYTHING.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.467
COMING TO A WATER PARK
HAS TO BE DIFFICULT.

16:14.467 --> 16:16.600
-I'M NOT GONNA LIE.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.733
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE WORN
SHORTS IN PUBLIC FOR, LIKE --

16:18.733 --> 16:20.200
IN, LIKE, A YEAR.

16:20.200 --> 16:23.467
YOU KNOW, SINCE I TRANSITIONED,
I HAVE NOT WORN SHORTS.

16:23.467 --> 16:25.967
LIKE, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU'VE GONE SWIMMING?

16:27.267 --> 16:29.800
-CAN'T REMEMBER.

16:29.800 --> 16:33.967
SO WHAT IS IT ABOUT TODAY THAT
MADE YOU DECIDE TO WEAR SHORTS?

16:33.967 --> 16:35.800
I'M NOT GOING TO WEAR JEANS
AT A WATER PARK.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.667
YEAH, TRUE.

16:37.667 --> 16:40.333
I REALLY FEEL LIKE
A BEACHED WHALE.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.333
YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY AS TRANS,
YOU HAVE DYSPHORIA,

16:42.333 --> 16:43.900
AND ONCE YOU HAVE BOOBS
AND YOU WANT TO SHOW

16:43.900 --> 16:45.633
YOUR CLEAVAGE, YAY,
THAT'S GOOD. BUT NOW...

16:45.633 --> 16:47.467
-YOUR BOOBS ARE, LIKE...
-THEY'RE BIG.

16:47.467 --> 16:48.867
-...RIDICULOUS.
-AND NOW I FEEL...

16:48.867 --> 16:50.367
JUST GONNA THROW THAT
OUT THERE.

16:50.367 --> 16:53.600
...BUT NOW IT JUST FEELS WAY...
LIKE, IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.800
I FEEL TOO IMMODEST RIGHT NOW.

16:55.800 --> 16:59.467
OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS,
I HAVE PUT ON A LOT OF WEIGHT.

16:59.467 --> 17:01.267
I LOOK AT MY BODY IN THE MIRROR,

17:01.267 --> 17:03.967
AND I'M NOT REALLY HAPPY
WITH THAT IMAGE.

17:03.967 --> 17:07.900
I GAINED SO MUCH WEIGHT
SO QUICKLY, AND IT'S...

17:07.900 --> 17:10.067
I DON'T KNOW. LIKE, I WANT TO
FIX IT, BUT, LIKE,

17:10.067 --> 17:11.867
I HAVE SUCH A BAD
BINGE EATING PROBLEM.

17:11.867 --> 17:13.167
LIKE, I CAN'T EVEN HELP MYSELF.

17:13.167 --> 17:14.433
LIKE, I'LL BE FULL,

17:14.433 --> 17:17.333
AND I'LL STILL END UP
EATING SOME MORE CRAP.

17:17.333 --> 17:19.067
Noelle: JAZZ DOESN'T HAVE
NECESSARILY

17:19.067 --> 17:21.367
THE HEALTHIEST RELATIONSHIP
WITH FOOD.

17:21.367 --> 17:23.733
IT'S SOMETHING I FEEL LIKE
MIGHT BE SERIOUS,

17:23.733 --> 17:25.733
MUCH MORE THAN SHE REALIZES,

17:25.733 --> 17:29.067
AND I HONESTLY WORRY A BIT
FOR HER.

17:29.067 --> 17:32.167
I HAVE REALLY BAD HABITS
WHEN IT COMES TO FOOD,

17:32.167 --> 17:33.967
AND IT'S BECOME
SUCH A COMFORT FOR ME

17:33.967 --> 17:35.833
THAT IT'S SO HARD TO LET IT GO.

17:35.833 --> 17:38.800
I KNOW THAT IT'S UNHEALTHY,
BUT I DON'T KNOW

17:38.800 --> 17:43.600
IF I HAVE ENOUGH MOTIVATION
TO TAKE ACTION AND STOP THIS.

17:43.600 --> 17:48.600
**

17:48.600 --> 17:51.167
EVERYTHING ELSE
IS JUST TRASH NOW.

17:51.167 --> 17:53.967
Jazz: IT'S REALLY HARD TO BE
THROWING AWAY THESE OBJECTS

17:53.967 --> 17:56.767
BECAUSE THEY WERE PART
OF SOMEONE'S LIFE.

17:58.500 --> 17:59.800
**

18:01.900 --> 18:09.067
**

18:09.067 --> 18:10.300
Greg: HEY, JAZZ?

18:10.300 --> 18:12.800
I HAVEN'T TALKED TO YOU
ABOUT YOUR TRIP TO PHILLY.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.067
Jazz: WELL, I MEAN,
I HAD A REALLY GOOD TIME.

18:15.067 --> 18:18.467
DID YOU GO INTO ANY SEMINARS
OR REALLY JUST...

18:18.467 --> 18:20.733
YEAH, DID YOU GO TO WORKSHOPS?
'CAUSE I WAS BUSY AT THE TABLE.

18:20.733 --> 18:23.400
UH, NAH, I DIDN'T GO TO ANY
WORKSHOPS THIS YEAR.

18:23.400 --> 18:25.900
Jeanette: TODAY,
WE'RE GOING TO THE KEYS

18:25.900 --> 18:28.467
BECAUSE THEY GOT THE WORST
OF THE HURRICANE.

18:28.467 --> 18:30.533
IT'S NO SKIN OFF OUR BACK

18:30.533 --> 18:33.867
TO JUST GO DOWN FOR A DAY
AND JUST HELP.

18:33.867 --> 18:37.333
I WANT JAZZ TO SEE THAT THERE'S
A BIGGER PICTURE OUT HERE.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.167
SHE DOES A LOT ADVOCACY.

18:39.167 --> 18:40.867
SHE DOES A LOT
OF CHARITABLE WORK,

18:40.867 --> 18:43.533
BUT IN THIS CASE,
IT'S ABOUT A BIGGER COMMUNITY.

18:43.533 --> 18:46.133
IT'S ABOUT
PEOPLE IN GENERAL.

18:46.133 --> 18:49.533
HOW DID YOUR FRIENDS FARE
FROM THE HURRICANE?

18:49.533 --> 18:53.333
NOELLE SAID THAT, YOU KNOW,
HER DAD LOST POWER

18:53.333 --> 18:55.067
AND THAT A FEW TREES FELL.

18:55.067 --> 19:00.133
AND I KNOW A FEW PEOPLE
FROM THE MIXER, THEY LOST POWER.

19:00.133 --> 19:02.133
DO YOU HAVE ANY PLANS
TO HANG OUT WITH THEM AGAIN?

19:02.133 --> 19:04.233
YEAH, WE WERE TALKING,

19:04.233 --> 19:06.567
AND WE THINK WE'RE GONNA
GET TOGETHER TOMORROW.

19:06.567 --> 19:08.067
THAT'S GOOD.

19:08.067 --> 19:09.267
YOU KNOW I'M ALWAYS HAPPY
WHEN YOU'RE BRANCHING OUT,

19:09.267 --> 19:10.833
SO THAT'S REALLY NICE.

19:10.833 --> 19:13.333
**

19:13.333 --> 19:15.467
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S
A LOT OF DEBRIS.

19:15.467 --> 19:16.700
Jazz: YEAH.

19:16.700 --> 19:18.067
LOOKIT, THAT BURGER KING
LOOKS LIKE IT'S...

19:18.067 --> 19:20.133
-Jeanette: OH, MY GOODNESS. WOW.

19:20.133 --> 19:21.767
THAT'S PART OF SOMEBODY'S
HOUSE RIGHT THERE.

19:21.767 --> 19:23.800
LOOK AT THAT SIGN. LOOK AT
THE GAS STATION, THE WHOLE ROOF.

19:23.800 --> 19:26.233
-Jazz: OH, MY GOD.
-THE WHOLE GAS STATION IS DOWN.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.100
THE WHOLE GAS STATION
FELL OVER.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.900
CAN YOU IMAGINE
COMING BACK TO THAT?

19:29.900 --> 19:31.567
IT HAS INSURANCE
INFORMATION ON IT.

19:31.567 --> 19:33.500
OH, MY GOD.
THESE ARE, LIKE, RVs.

19:33.500 --> 19:36.767
YEAH, THE ONES THAT WERE NOT
EMBEDDED INTO THE GROUND.

19:36.767 --> 19:38.433
AS WE'RE DRIVING DOWN
TO THE KEYS,

19:38.433 --> 19:41.700
WE SEE A LOT OF DEVASTATION.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.333
IT DEFINITELY FEELS
A LITTLE BIT WEIRD

19:43.333 --> 19:47.067
KNOWING THAT I WASN'T ACTUALLY
THERE TO WITNESS THE STORM,

19:47.067 --> 19:50.167
SO I JUST WANT TO PROVIDE
ANY RELIEF I CAN.

19:50.167 --> 19:53.300
I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS 'CAUSE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT,

19:53.300 --> 19:55.300
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO PEOPLE

19:55.300 --> 19:57.100
THAT HAVE LOST
ALL THEIR HOME

19:57.100 --> 19:59.467
OR PART OF THEIR HOME
AND THEIR BELONGINGS.

19:59.467 --> 20:01.533
I IMAGINE THERE'S
SOME GREAT NEED.

20:01.533 --> 20:04.133
SO I THINK YOU NEED
TO BE PREPARED

20:04.133 --> 20:08.433
FOR SOME PRETTY
DEVASTATING STUFF.

20:08.433 --> 20:11.000
JUST KNOW THAT
IT COULD GET EMOTIONAL.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.733
**

20:15.733 --> 20:16.900
TRASH?

20:16.900 --> 20:18.600
MM-HMM.
ALL OF IT'S TRASH, BABY.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.433
**

20:21.433 --> 20:24.400
Jeanette: WHEN WE PULL UP,
IT'S JUST PURE DEVASTATION.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.833
IT LOOKED LIKE A BOMB
HAD LANDED.

20:26.833 --> 20:29.700
Woman: HEY, BABY.
IF IT'S ALL MOLDY,
PLEASE DON'T TOUCH IT, OKAY?

20:29.700 --> 20:31.100
Boy: OKAY.

20:31.100 --> 20:32.433
Greg:
THE COMMUNITY NEEDS HELP,

20:32.433 --> 20:36.200
AND WHAT LITTLE HELP
WE COULD PROVIDE IS --

20:36.200 --> 20:37.567
I-I DON'T THINK
IT'S ENOUGH, OBVIOUSLY,

20:37.567 --> 20:39.933
BUT AT LEAST
WE'RE GONNA TRY.

20:39.933 --> 20:41.100
-HI.
-HI.

20:41.100 --> 20:42.267
-Jazz: HELLO.

20:42.267 --> 20:43.500
-I'M GREG.
-MARSHALL.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.767
-HI, MARSHALL. NICE TO MEET YOU.
-NICE TO MEET YOU.

20:45.767 --> 20:47.667
-THIS IS JAZZ.
-HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.

20:47.667 --> 20:48.833
HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.

20:48.833 --> 20:50.267
Marshall:
IT'S ALL SORT OF SURREAL.

20:50.267 --> 20:54.500
I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED
ANYTHING THIS BAD BEFORE.

20:54.500 --> 20:57.400
THIS IS, BY FAR,
THE WORST I'VE EVER SEEN.

20:57.400 --> 21:00.067
-THIS IS MY SON, TRISTAN.
-THIS IS OUR LITTLE MAN TRISTAN.

21:00.067 --> 21:01.500
-HI.
-Greg: HEY, TRISTAN.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.267
-SAY, "HI."
-NICE TO MEET YOU.

21:03.267 --> 21:04.767
Marshall:
IT'S BEEN A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

21:04.767 --> 21:08.233
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO TAKE IT AS
WE GO AND REBUILD WHAT WE CAN.

21:08.233 --> 21:11.267
WE DID.

21:11.267 --> 21:13.867
WE EVACUATED TWICE.

21:13.867 --> 21:17.067
WE EVACUATED TO FAMILY,
AND WHERE WE WERE

21:17.067 --> 21:21.100
WAS PROJECTED 10 FEET OF WATER.

21:21.100 --> 21:22.500
MY HUSBAND AND I CAN SWIM,

21:22.500 --> 21:25.133
BUT TO ASK A LITTLE ONE
TO DO THAT IS A LOT,

21:25.133 --> 21:29.367
SO WE EVACUATED TO
ANOTHER FRIEND'S HOUSE AND...

21:29.367 --> 21:32.433
-WE GOT HIT THERE.
-BY THE HURRICANE, YEP.

21:32.433 --> 21:35.067
Greg: HOW LONG HAVE YOU LIVED
IN THIS COMMUNITY?

21:35.067 --> 21:38.933
I ACTUALLY GREW UP IN THIS HOME.

21:38.933 --> 21:40.233
-THIS IS IT.
-THIS IS IT FOR YOU. YEAH.

21:40.233 --> 21:44.667
Lauren: THIS IS MY COMMUNITY.
THIS IS MY FAMILY.

21:44.667 --> 21:47.467
I MEAN, WE'RE THANKFUL
THAT WE'RE ALL OKAY.

21:47.467 --> 21:50.733
IT'S A LOT TO, UH, TO HANDLE.

21:50.733 --> 21:54.800
I MEAN, IT'S JUST THINGS,
BUT IT'S OUR THINGS.

21:54.800 --> 21:56.733
UM...

21:56.733 --> 21:59.300
I THINK -- I'M NOT SO WORRIED
ABOUT MYSELF,

21:59.300 --> 22:02.067
BUT IT'S SAD BEING A CHILD,

22:02.067 --> 22:04.233
SO HE'S OUR MAIN CONCERN
RIGHT NOW.

22:04.233 --> 22:06.900
HE LOOKS PRETTY TOUGH TO ME.
ARE YOU PRETTY TOUGH?

22:06.900 --> 22:08.700
HE'S A TOUGH ONE.

22:08.700 --> 22:10.867
Jeanette: THEY HAVE
BEEN THROUGH THE WORST,

22:10.867 --> 22:13.067
AND ALL MY MIND
CAN THINK IS,

22:13.067 --> 22:14.367
"WHAT CAN I DO?
HOW CAN I HELP?"

22:14.367 --> 22:15.567
SO I KNOW
THERE'S A WHOLE GROUP

22:15.567 --> 22:17.500
OF VOLUNTEERS, LIKE,
RIGHT OVER HERE.

22:17.500 --> 22:18.733
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO BEGIN?

22:18.733 --> 22:21.067
ANYTHING YOU GUYS
ARE WILLING TO HELP WITH,

22:21.067 --> 22:23.467
WE ARE ABSOLUTELY WILLING
TO TAKE.

22:23.467 --> 22:25.367
IT'S OUR PLEASURE TO HELP,
REALLY.

22:25.367 --> 22:27.700
-THANK YOU.
-Jeanette: YOU'RE WELCOME.

22:27.700 --> 22:29.133
-Marshall: THANK YOU, GUYS.
-Lauren: THANK YOU.

22:29.133 --> 22:30.367
-THANK YOU.
-THANK YOU SO MUCH.

22:30.367 --> 22:31.700
Man: HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

22:31.700 --> 22:35.500
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPRESS
HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO ME

22:35.500 --> 22:37.967
THAT PEOPLE OUT THERE
STILL CARE.

22:37.967 --> 22:40.800
BESIDES THAT MINI FRIDGE,
EVERYTHING ELSE

22:40.800 --> 22:44.133
IS JUST TRASH NOW, SO...
-Jeanette: YEAH.

22:44.133 --> 22:46.767
HERE. LET'S PLACE IT
GENTLY OVER HERE.

22:46.767 --> 22:48.433
-WE'LL GET YOU MORE STUFF.

22:48.433 --> 22:52.467
GET YOU MORE SCHOOL STUFF.

22:52.467 --> 22:54.067
WE'LL HELP YOU
WITH MORE SCHOOL STUFF.

22:54.067 --> 22:56.500
DON'T WORRY. IT'S JUST PAPER.
THAT'S ALL IT IS.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.167
IT'S JUST PAPER.
IT'S JUST PAPER.

22:59.167 --> 23:01.567
Greg: I THINK THAT
WHEN PEOPLE SEE IT ON TV,

23:01.567 --> 23:02.967
THEY'RE NUMB TO IT,

23:02.967 --> 23:05.700
BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT VIBE
WHEN YOU'RE PHYSICALLY THERE,

23:05.700 --> 23:08.833
WHEN YOU SEE THE FAMILIES
THAT ARE AFFECTED.

23:08.833 --> 23:10.400
MY HEART GOES OUT THEM.

23:10.400 --> 23:14.500
I JUST...I JUST REALLY DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THEM.

23:15.700 --> 23:17.433
Jazz: IT'S REALLY HARD
TO BE THROWING AWAY

23:17.433 --> 23:18.933
SOME OF THESE OBJECTS.

23:18.933 --> 23:23.333
YOU KNOW, I'M FINDING COUCHES,
PIECES OF FURNITURE,

23:23.333 --> 23:26.667
AND THESE OBJECTS
WERE PART OF SOMEONE'S LIFE.

23:26.667 --> 23:28.800
-GOOD.

23:28.800 --> 23:31.267
Jazz: I CAN'T IMAGINE
A KID TRISTAN'S AGE

23:31.267 --> 23:34.367
GOING THROUGH
SUCH A CATASTROPHIC LIKE THIS.

23:34.367 --> 23:37.900
DID YOU FRIENDS FACE A LOT OF
DAMAGE, TOO, TO THEIR HOMES?

23:37.900 --> 23:39.067
I DO NOT KNOW.

23:39.067 --> 23:40.067
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
SEEN YOUR FRIENDS?

23:40.067 --> 23:42.100
-NO.

23:42.100 --> 23:44.167
-NOT REALLY.

23:44.167 --> 23:46.900
Jazz:
I REALLY ADMIRED HIS BRAVERY.

23:46.900 --> 23:49.533
Jeanette: I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THERE'S NO PHOTOS IN HERE.

23:49.533 --> 23:53.767
I'M DIFFERENT THAN ALL
THE OTHER VOLUNTEERS

23:53.767 --> 23:57.500
BECAUSE THEY COME WITH
A MISSION TO GUT EVERYTHING,

23:57.500 --> 23:59.867
BUT I'M A LITTLE BIT
OF A PACK RAT,

23:59.867 --> 24:03.333
SO MY HEART WAS AT, LIKE,
"LET'S TRY TO SAVE SOMETHING."

24:03.333 --> 24:05.300
DO WANT ME TO TAKE THIS HOME AND
WASH IT FOR YOU INSTEAD OF...

24:05.300 --> 24:07.133
-THAT WOULD BE SO GREAT.
-GREAT. GREAT.

24:07.133 --> 24:09.733
DO YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS?
THERE'S A DRIVER'S LICENSE.

24:09.733 --> 24:11.767
THAT'S MY GRANDMA.
I APPRECIATE THIS.

24:11.767 --> 24:14.200
THIS IS...
SHE'S NOT AROUND ANYMORE.

24:14.200 --> 24:17.167
-OH, THAT'S MY MOM'S!

24:17.167 --> 24:20.500
Greg: THERE'S MORE IMPORTANT
THINGS IN LIFE THAN JUST THINGS.

24:20.500 --> 24:23.300
LOVE AND FAMILY
AND COMMUNITY

24:23.300 --> 24:25.233
AND STICKING TOGETHER
THROUGH HARDSHIP,

24:25.233 --> 24:27.567
THAT'S REALLY
WHAT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.700
YOU COULD TAKE AWAY THINGS,

24:29.700 --> 24:34.167
BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE AWAY
THE HUMAN SPIRIT.

24:34.167 --> 24:36.733
-LOOK AT HOW GOOD IT LOOKS.
-Tristan: I KNOW.

24:36.733 --> 24:38.900
ALREADY,
IT LOOKS LIKE NORMAL.

24:38.900 --> 24:40.400
Marshall: IT WILL ALL
BE BACK TO NORMAL SOON.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.767
-Tristan: VERY SOON.

24:42.767 --> 24:44.467
THIS IS FOR YOU.

24:44.467 --> 24:48.200
I HEARD YOU LIKE TOOL KITS
AND YOU LOST YOUR TOYS.

24:48.200 --> 24:49.867
-THANK YOU.

24:49.867 --> 24:51.133
-OF COURSE.
-AND THERE'S MORE HERE, TOO.

24:51.133 --> 24:52.600
Jeanette: AND GREG
HAS SOME STUFF FOR YOU, TOO.

24:52.600 --> 24:54.967
-Jazz: HERE YOU GO.

24:54.967 --> 24:56.833
DO YOU WANT TO OPEN IT UP?

24:56.833 --> 24:59.567
ARE YOU GONNA SHRED
WITH THAT?

24:59.567 --> 25:01.867
-AH!

25:01.867 --> 25:03.500
Marshall: IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN MONTHS

25:03.500 --> 25:04.833
BEFORE WE GOT THIS PLACE CLEAN.

25:04.833 --> 25:07.300
WE COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT EVERYBODY'S HELP.

25:07.300 --> 25:09.600
ME AND MY FAMILY ARE
SO, SO GRATEFUL.

25:09.600 --> 25:11.733
I APPRECIATE IT.
OH, MY GOD.

25:11.733 --> 25:17.067
HOME TO ME NOW IS
WHEREVER I AM WITH MY FAMILY.

25:17.067 --> 25:19.167
THEY'RE DEFINITELY MY BACKBONE.

25:20.667 --> 25:25.267
**

25:25.267 --> 25:27.867
I'M GLAD --
I'M GLAD WE MADE IT BACK.

25:27.867 --> 25:30.767
Jazz: MEETING THIS FAMILY
WAS REALLY HUMBLING.

25:30.767 --> 25:32.900
NO MATTER WHAT OBSTACLES
I HAVE TO FACE,

25:32.900 --> 25:35.400
I'M FORTUNATE
TO HAVE WHAT I HAVE.

25:35.400 --> 25:38.100
NOTHING COMPARES TO
THE PERSONAL GRATIFICATION

25:38.100 --> 25:40.733
FROM DOING SOMETHING GOOD
FOR THIS COMMUNITY.

25:40.733 --> 25:50.733
**

25:50.800 --> 25:59.400
**

25:59.467 --> 26:02.867
**

26:02.867 --> 26:04.300
OH, HELLO, CHILDREN.

26:04.300 --> 26:05.300
-OH, HELLO.
-HELLO, HELLO.

26:05.300 --> 26:06.400
-HELLO.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.867
-SO NICE TO SEE YOU.

26:07.867 --> 26:11.667
TODAY, I'M MEETING WITH SOME
NEW PEOPLE THAT I MET AT A MIXER

26:11.667 --> 26:14.167
THAT I REALLY WANTED TO
GET TO KNOW MORE.

26:14.167 --> 26:15.967
OH, MY GOD.
LOOK AT THIS PIZZA.

26:15.967 --> 26:17.933
IN THE PAST, I REALLY HAVEN'T
DONE A LOT

26:17.933 --> 26:19.400
TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH PEOPLE,

26:19.400 --> 26:22.167
BUT I'VE REALIZED THAT
BEING SOCIAL IS BETTER FOR ME.

26:22.167 --> 26:25.567
AND ULTIMATELY, I WANT
TO FIND A LOVE INTEREST.

26:25.567 --> 26:28.367
BUT FIRST,
I NEED TO MAKE FRIENDS.

26:28.367 --> 26:30.467
OH, MY GOD. WHAT...

26:30.467 --> 26:31.833
I SHOULD BE EATING HEALTHY.

26:31.833 --> 26:33.767
-GIRL.

26:33.767 --> 26:36.433
THIS IS WHAT I GOTTA SAY
ABOUT THAT.

26:36.433 --> 26:38.900
I WAS VERY EXCITED THAT
JAZZ REACHED OUT TO US AGAIN

26:38.900 --> 26:41.067
ABOUT HANGING OUT
'CAUSE FROM THE GET-GO

26:41.067 --> 26:43.433
I KIND OF WANTED THIS TO BE,
LIKE, A LASTING FRIENDSHIP.

26:43.433 --> 26:45.067
SO, LIKE, LAST TIME
I WAS AT THE DOCTOR'S,

26:45.067 --> 26:48.533
SHE WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW, "YOU'RE
JUST A LITTLE OVERWEIGHT.

26:48.533 --> 26:50.133
"MAYBE, LIKE, YOU KNOW,
WHEN SUPER BOWL COMES AROUND,

26:50.133 --> 26:51.633
LIKE, DON'T EAT
SO MUCH CHIPS."

26:51.633 --> 26:53.667
AND I WAS LIKE, "YOU'RE ASSUMING
I WATCH FOOTBALL?"

26:55.067 --> 26:58.133
IT'S LIKE, "LOOK, SWEETIE,
LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT."

26:58.133 --> 27:01.167
SO HOW IS EVERYBODY DOING
OVERALL

27:01.167 --> 27:03.567
ESPECIALLY AFTER THE HURRICANE?

27:03.567 --> 27:04.967
-PRETTY GOOD.
-DOING WELL.

27:04.967 --> 27:06.333
Evan: HOW ABOUT YOU?

27:06.333 --> 27:09.167
WE ACTUALLY WENT TO THE KEYS
TO HELP WITH CLEANING UP,

27:09.167 --> 27:11.600
AND IT WAS
AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.167
GOD BLESS YOU.

27:13.167 --> 27:15.700
BEING ABLE TO SPEND TIME
WITH ANOTHER TRANSGENDER FEMALE

27:15.700 --> 27:18.467
IS DEFINITELY A HUGE...

27:18.467 --> 27:20.200
I CAN'T BE MORE GRATEFUL

27:20.200 --> 27:22.667
BECAUSE I DON'T GET
TO DO THAT EVERY DAY.

27:22.667 --> 27:24.967
I WANT A SLICE OF HAWAIIAN.

27:24.967 --> 27:26.900
-ELEVENTH GRADE.

27:26.900 --> 27:29.067
MIDDLE SCHOOL, THOUGH,
WILL ALWAYS BE THE WORST.

27:29.067 --> 27:30.167
I KNOW.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, LIKE,

27:30.167 --> 27:31.667
HOW PEOPLE ARE LIKE,
"HIGH SCHOOLERS, YOU KNOW,

27:31.667 --> 27:33.067
ARE THE WORST."
I'M LIKE, "UNH-UNH."

27:33.067 --> 27:34.267
HAVE YOU BEEN
TO MIDDLE SCHOOL?

27:34.267 --> 27:35.433
HAVE THESE PEOPLE EVER
BEEN TO MIDDLE SCHOOL?

27:35.433 --> 27:36.600
LIKE, MIDDLE SCHOOL
IS TERRIBLE.

27:36.600 --> 27:39.233
I GOT LOCKED IN A BATHROOM
AT MIDDLE SCHOOL.

27:39.233 --> 27:42.067
THINGS ONLY STARTED GETTING
BETTER, LIKE, IN EIGHTH GRADE,

27:42.067 --> 27:43.900
AND THAT'S WHEN WE'RE ALL
JUST LIKE, "OKAY, LET'S CHILL.

27:43.900 --> 27:45.200
LIKE, WE CAN
ALL BE FRIENDS NOW."

27:45.200 --> 27:47.067
-OH, PUBERTY.
-YEAH, EXACTLY.

27:47.067 --> 27:48.667
-I KNOW.
-MY GOODNESS.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.600
Jazz: I'M DEFINITELY VIBING
WITH THESE PEOPLE.

27:50.600 --> 27:54.067
I SENSE THAT THEY ARE THEIR
AUTHENTIC SELVES NO MATTER WHAT.

27:54.067 --> 27:55.600
THEY SAY WHAT'S ON THEIR MIND.

27:55.600 --> 27:58.200
AND I WANT TO BE ABLE
TO BRANCH OUT

27:58.200 --> 28:00.633
WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT
WHAT OTHERS THINK ABOUT ME,

28:00.633 --> 28:03.733
AND I CAN JUST BE FREE
AND BE MYSELF.

28:03.733 --> 28:04.800
-Michaela: STRAWS ARE NECESSARY.
-OOH.

28:04.800 --> 28:06.400
I DRINK MY HOT COFFEE
WITH A STRAW.

28:06.400 --> 28:08.333
-GOOD ONE.
-GOOD ONE, YEAH.

28:08.333 --> 28:11.233
IS ANYBODY, LIKE,
DATING ANYBODY?

28:11.233 --> 28:12.733
NO, NOT CURRENTLY.

28:12.733 --> 28:15.767
I WOULD BE INTERESTED,
BUT I JUST WANT IT

28:15.767 --> 28:17.333
TO HAPPEN NATURALLY, YOU KNOW?

28:17.333 --> 28:18.833
WELL, LIKE, THEY DO SAY
LOVE COMES TO YOU

28:18.833 --> 28:20.067
WHEN YOU'RE NOT LOOKING
FOR IT, SO...

28:20.067 --> 28:21.533
THAT'S TRUE.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.967
THAT HAPPENED TO ME, AND I'M
A YEAR INTO IT NOW, SO...

28:23.967 --> 28:27.467
SAYS THE GIRL WHO FOUND HER LOVE
THROUGH TINDER.

28:27.467 --> 28:28.633
YOU KNOW WHAT...

28:28.633 --> 28:30.467
"I WASN'T LOOKING FOR IT.
IT WAS ALL NATURAL."

28:30.467 --> 28:32.133
YEAH. YEAH.

28:32.133 --> 28:34.433
I KEEP STARING
AT THE HAWAIIAN PIZZA.

28:34.433 --> 28:35.833
-THERE'S TWO SLICES LEFT.

28:35.833 --> 28:39.167
-I DO, BUT I SHOULDN'T.

28:39.167 --> 28:41.067
I LITERALLY HAVE A PROBLEM.

28:41.067 --> 28:43.067
DO YOU GUYS KNOW
HOW MANY SLICES I ATE?

28:45.667 --> 28:47.467
TAKE GUESSES.
LET'S TAKE GUESSES.

28:47.467 --> 28:49.067
FOUR. WHAT'S YOUR GUESS?

28:49.067 --> 28:51.233
-TWO.
-THREE.

28:51.233 --> 28:52.900
I WOULD SAY
THREE OR FOUR, YEAH.

28:52.900 --> 28:55.633
FOUR.

28:55.633 --> 28:57.833
I'M HAVING A LOT OF FUN
WITH EVERYONE AGAIN.

28:57.833 --> 29:02.700
THEY JUST ALL HAVE VERY POSITIVE
AND UPLIFTING ENERGIES.

29:02.700 --> 29:05.700
I WAS REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT THESE PEOPLE

29:05.700 --> 29:08.567
BECAUSE I FELT LIKE I COULD
MAKE SOME NEW FRIENDS,

29:08.567 --> 29:10.833
AND I FEEL LIKE I HAVE.

29:10.833 --> 29:12.267
I LAUGH-FARTED.

29:12.267 --> 29:15.300
-Evan: OH, MY GOD.

29:15.300 --> 29:18.867
-I'M SO SORRY.
-AT LEAST YOU REAL ABOUT IT.

29:18.867 --> 29:21.100
**

29:21.100 --> 29:23.333
NOT TO BRING UP
THE BAD NEWS FIRST,

29:23.333 --> 29:26.833
BUT YOUR SURGERY
WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT.

29:26.833 --> 29:29.133
Jazz: THE FACT THAT I MIGHT NOT
BE ABLE TO GET THE SURGERY,

29:29.133 --> 29:32.567
I AM ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIED.

29:32.567 --> 29:33.100
**

29:35.833 --> 29:42.667
**

29:42.733 --> 29:46.533
**

29:46.533 --> 29:49.133
-NO.

29:49.133 --> 29:51.967
-AN OLD PRO AT THIS ALREADY.
-Jazz: YEAH.

29:54.100 --> 29:55.733
-HELLO.
-HI.

29:55.733 --> 29:56.967
FOR JAZZ.

29:56.967 --> 29:58.467
HI.
GO AHEAD AND TAKE A SEAT.

29:58.467 --> 29:59.867
SURE. THANK YOU.

29:59.867 --> 30:02.967
FEELING A LITTLE ANXIOUS
WALKING INTO DR. BOWERS' OFFICE.

30:02.967 --> 30:05.333
LOOKS LIKE WE'VE
BEEN HERE BEFORE.

30:05.333 --> 30:06.500
-YES.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.867
-READY FOR YOU.
-COOL.

30:08.867 --> 30:11.467
DéJà VU.

30:11.467 --> 30:13.433
-I REALLY...
-IT'S DéJà VU ALL OVER AGAIN.

30:13.433 --> 30:15.867
DéJà VU IS
ALL OVER AGAIN.

30:17.900 --> 30:19.533
I'LL JUST BE TAKING YOUR VITALS.

30:19.533 --> 30:23.033
WE CAN START OFF
WITH YOUR WEIGHT.

30:23.033 --> 30:25.233
CLOSE YOUR EYES.
I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO LOOK.

30:25.233 --> 30:26.400
LOOK. LOOK.
WE'RE COVERING OUR EYES.

30:26.400 --> 30:29.133
-Greg: I WON'T LOOK.
-OKAY.

30:29.133 --> 30:31.167
BEING WEIGHED
IN A DOCTOR'S OFFICE

30:31.167 --> 30:34.033
IS PROBABLY ONE OF
THE MOST TERRIBLE THINGS

30:34.033 --> 30:36.200
BECAUSE USUALLY WHEN YOU
WEIGH YOURSELF, YOU'RE ALONE,

30:36.200 --> 30:38.200
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,
NO ONE ELSE SEES THE NUMBER.

30:38.200 --> 30:41.667
SO MY PARENTS, THEY BETTER CLOSE
THEIR EYES AND NO PEEPIN'.

30:41.667 --> 30:43.133
SO I'LL JUST GO GET DR. BOWERS,

30:43.133 --> 30:44.433
AND SHE SHOULD BE IN
WITH YOU SHORTLY.

30:44.433 --> 30:46.700
-OKAY. COOL. THANK YOU.
-OKAY.

30:46.700 --> 30:49.233
I WAS ABOUT TO CRY
WHEN I SAW THAT NUMBER.

30:49.233 --> 30:50.467
BUT YOU KNEW WHAT THE NUMBER
WAS GOING TO BE

30:50.467 --> 30:52.100
BEFORE YOU EVEN STEPPED
ON THE SCALE, RIGHT?

30:52.100 --> 30:55.933
NO. IT'S MORE.
EVEN MORE THAN EVER.

30:55.933 --> 30:58.067
EVER.

30:58.067 --> 31:00.100
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SUMMER,

31:00.100 --> 31:02.433
I WAS, LIKE,
20 TO 25 POUNDS LESS,

31:02.433 --> 31:03.800
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU COULD GAIN

31:03.800 --> 31:09.633
THAT MUCH WEIGHT WITHIN
A FEW MONTHS, AND...

31:09.633 --> 31:12.667
I NEED -- I NEED TO CONFESS.

31:12.667 --> 31:13.867
Jeanette: WHAT?

31:13.867 --> 31:15.800
LAST WEEK, WHEN I WENT TO
THE GROCERY STORE,

31:15.800 --> 31:18.267
I DID NOT JUST BUY HEALTHY FOOD.

31:18.267 --> 31:20.567
I BOUGHT, UM...

31:20.567 --> 31:23.200
A WHOLE CONTAINER OF
FRIED CHICKEN

31:23.200 --> 31:25.833
AND ATE IT ALL,

31:25.833 --> 31:28.567
AND CHOCOLATE MILK

31:28.567 --> 31:31.733
AND THE BIGGEST NUTELLA.

31:31.733 --> 31:33.600
**

31:33.600 --> 31:36.200
WHEN YOU SAID A BIG THING
OF NUTELLA, LIKE, ONE OF THESE?

31:36.200 --> 31:37.800
AND YOU ATE THE WHOLE THING
IN ONE DAY?

31:37.800 --> 31:39.233
YEAH.

31:39.233 --> 31:41.533
Jeanette: IT'S VERY OBVIOUS
THAT JAZZ'S BINGE-EATING

31:41.533 --> 31:43.433
IS STARTING TO SPIN
OUT OF CONTROL.

31:43.433 --> 31:46.533
WHEN IT COMES TO EATING,
I LIE TO YOU GUYS ALL THE TIME.

31:46.533 --> 31:49.433
Greg: WE HAVEN'T EVEN SPOKEN TO
DOCTOR ABOUT WHY WE'RE OUT HERE,

31:49.433 --> 31:53.800
AND THAT IS ALREADY WEIGHING ON
HER HEAVY, AND IT'S REALLY...

31:53.800 --> 31:55.233
FOR ME, IT'S UPSETTING,

31:55.233 --> 32:00.300
AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE
JAZZ KNOWS IT'S SIGNIFICANT.

32:00.300 --> 32:03.067
DO YOU WANT TO FIX IT OR...

32:03.067 --> 32:06.067
OBVIOUSLY I WANT TO,
BUT I'M NOT ABLE TO.

32:06.067 --> 32:08.767
I MEAN, YOU KNOW THAT GOES TO
AN ISSUE OF MATURITY,

32:08.767 --> 32:11.633
AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO FOCUS OF THESE THINGS.

32:11.633 --> 32:12.767
I'M IMMATURE.
I KNOW I'M IMMATURE.

32:12.767 --> 32:16.067
I DON'T KNOW...

32:16.067 --> 32:17.367
YOU GOT TO TAKE THE BULL
BY THE HORNS.

32:17.367 --> 32:19.100
YOU GOT TO, EVEN IF IT'S
JUST BABY STEPS,

32:19.100 --> 32:20.933
JUST MAKE SOME CHANGES.

32:20.933 --> 32:24.867
I FEEL BAD 'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE
THE SUPPORT SYSTEM IS THERE,

32:24.867 --> 32:28.067
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY
AN INDIVIDUAL SPORT.

32:28.067 --> 32:31.933
IT'S REALLY SOMETHING THAT SHE
HAS TO WANT TO DO ON HER OWN.

32:31.933 --> 32:34.400
Jeanette: UNFORTUNATELY,
JAZZ IS NOT SUPER DISCIPLINED.

32:34.400 --> 32:36.267
THAT'S NOT WHERE HER MIND
IS AT RIGHT NOW.

32:36.267 --> 32:38.167
SHE WANTS TO DO
WHAT JAZZ WANTS TO DO.

32:39.400 --> 32:41.500
-OH, LOOK WHO IT IS!
-HEY!

32:41.500 --> 32:42.733
-HI.
-HUG. HUG. HUG. HUG. HUG.

32:44.667 --> 32:47.567
I SAW JAZZ AND HER FOLKS
ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO,

32:47.567 --> 32:50.233
AND THAT WAS ACTUALLY
THE FIRST TIME

32:50.233 --> 32:52.267
I'VE GOTTEN TO EXAMINE JAZZ.

32:52.267 --> 32:54.067
SO I CALLED THE JENNINGS TODAY

32:54.067 --> 32:56.567
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN SPEAKING
WITH COLLEAGUES,

32:56.567 --> 32:58.933
AND I WANTED TO GET THEIR TAKE
ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES.

32:58.933 --> 33:01.500
SO I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP
WITH YOU IN PERSON

33:01.500 --> 33:05.200
JUST BECAUSE YOUR SURGERY
WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT

33:05.200 --> 33:10.067
IN TERMS OF WHAT EVEN
THE MOST EXPERIENCED SURGEONS

33:10.067 --> 33:12.900
HAVE ENCOUNTERED.
-MM-HMM.

33:12.900 --> 33:14.833
NOT TO BRING UP
THE BAD NEWS FIRST,

33:14.833 --> 33:19.333
BUT YOU GAIN IN YOUR B.M.I.,
WHICH IS CALLED BODY MASS INDEX,

33:19.333 --> 33:21.967
WHICH BASICALLY LOOKS AT YOUR
WEIGHT COMPARED TO YOUR HEIGHT.

33:21.967 --> 33:25.733
IF WE'RE GOING TO GET
A HOSPITAL TO SAY,

33:25.733 --> 33:28.433
"WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW
A SURGERY AT AGE 17,"

33:28.433 --> 33:31.467
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO BE AT A LOWER B.M.I.

33:31.467 --> 33:36.900
LITERALLY, THEY WON'T APPROVE IT
IF YOUR B.M.I. IS ONE DOT OVER.

33:36.900 --> 33:40.667
WHEN IT TRANSLATES TO POUNDS,
IT'S ABOUT 30 POUNDS.

33:40.667 --> 33:43.167
**

33:43.167 --> 33:45.567
Jazz: THE FACT THAT I MIGHT NOT
BE ABLE TO GET THE SURGERY

33:45.567 --> 33:50.300
IF I DON'T LOSE 30 POUNDS,
I AM ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIED.

33:50.300 --> 33:52.433
I KNEW THAT MY WEIGHT
WAS A PROBLEM,

33:52.433 --> 33:55.633
BUT I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT
IT COULD AFFECT SOMETHING

33:55.633 --> 33:57.600
THAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.967
WHY DO THEY DECLINE YOU
IF YOUR B.M.I. IS TOO HIGH?

34:00.967 --> 34:03.067
IF THERE'S MORE FAT,
IF THERE'S MORE WEIGHT,

34:03.067 --> 34:07.233
IT MAKES THE SURGERY LONGER
AND IT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT.

34:07.233 --> 34:11.300
WE HAVEN'T HAD A LOT OF KIDS WHO
HAVE HAD THEIR PUBERTY BLOCKED

34:11.300 --> 34:13.433
AND THEN ARE FACING SURGERY
AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE.

34:13.433 --> 34:15.167
SO WE WANT TO GO INTO THIS

34:15.167 --> 34:17.800
WITH EVERY ARROW WE CAN
IN OUR QUIVER.

34:17.800 --> 34:19.267
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

34:19.267 --> 34:20.600
Dr. Bowers:
WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT

34:20.600 --> 34:23.167
AS ONE NEW TECHNOLOGY EMERGES,

34:23.167 --> 34:27.833
LIKE HORMONE BLOCKADE, NOBODY
THOUGHT WE COULD BLOCK PUBERTY,

34:27.833 --> 34:30.233
IT CREATES ANOTHER
PROBLEM ELSEWHERE.

34:30.233 --> 34:32.067
NOW WE DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH TISSUE TO CREATE

34:32.067 --> 34:35.133
THE ADULT GENITALS
OF THE OPPOSITE SEX.

34:35.133 --> 34:37.433
WE SOLVE ONE PROBLEM,
BUT WE CREATE ANOTHER.

34:37.433 --> 34:40.100
IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF
A WHAC-A-MOLE

34:40.100 --> 34:41.700
KIND OF APPROACH TO MEDICINE,

34:41.700 --> 34:44.167
BUT THIS IS
HOW MEDICINE ADVANCES.

34:44.167 --> 34:46.433
HOW MANY HAVE YOU SEEN
LIKE JAZZ?

34:46.433 --> 34:48.767
WE'VE DONE
MORE THAN A DOZEN.

34:48.767 --> 34:50.967
AS SUPPRESSED AS ME?

34:50.967 --> 34:52.667
NOT QUITE AS SUPPRESSED
AS YOU.

34:52.667 --> 34:54.233
SO I'M THE MOST SUPPRESSED
YOU'VE EVER SEEN?

34:54.233 --> 34:56.700
YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH THERE.

34:56.700 --> 34:59.267
WE WANT TO GET AS MUCH SKIN
FROM EVERYWHERE.

34:59.267 --> 35:01.467
WHAT I'M ACTUALLY THINKING
IS THAT MAYBE WHAT WE DO

35:01.467 --> 35:04.333
IS WE PRESCRIBE
TOPICAL TESTOSTERONE.

35:06.300 --> 35:09.600
I JUST DON'T WANT THAT PART
OF MY BODY GROWING AT ALL.

35:09.600 --> 35:10.900
BUT ISN'T THAT PART
OF THE POINT?

35:10.900 --> 35:12.067
DOWN...BUT THAT IS THE POINT.

35:12.067 --> 35:13.700
THAT'S POINT, I KNOW.

35:13.700 --> 35:16.533
I ALREADY HAVE DYSPHORIA
AS IT IS,

35:16.533 --> 35:18.333
BUT KNOWING THAT THAT
PART OF MY BODY

35:18.333 --> 35:20.067
IS GOING TO BE GROWING MORE,

35:20.067 --> 35:22.567
THIS SOUNDS LIKE
MY WORST NIGHTMARE.

35:22.567 --> 35:25.467
HAS YOUR DOCTOR LOOKED
AT YOUR TESTOSTERONE LEVEL?

35:25.467 --> 35:26.900
IT'S VERY LOW.

35:26.900 --> 35:28.700
WOMEN HAVE TESTOSTERONE,

35:28.700 --> 35:33.500
AND TESTOSTERONE IS A LARGE
PART OF WHAT DRIVES LIBIDO.

35:33.500 --> 35:35.833
HAVE YOU TRIED A LITTLE BIT...

35:35.833 --> 35:36.967
I'VE TRIED, BUT...

35:36.967 --> 35:39.067
...TO GET POSITIVE FEELINGS
AND EVEN ORGASM?

35:39.067 --> 35:41.767
I'VE TRIED AND WITH NO PREVAIL.

35:41.767 --> 35:44.133
I HAVE SUCH A LOW LIBIDO
FROM, YOU KNOW,

35:44.133 --> 35:46.067
THE SUPPRESSION
AND THE BLOCKERS.

35:46.067 --> 35:48.800
I JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY SEXUAL DESIRES,

35:48.800 --> 35:51.200
AND IT'S HONESTLY FRUSTRATING.

35:51.200 --> 35:55.833
THE ONE OTHER THING I WANT TO
ADD IS THAT OF TISSUE EXPANDERS.

35:55.833 --> 35:58.667
A TISSUE EXPANDER IS
AN IMPLANTABLE DEVICE

35:58.667 --> 36:01.433
THAT YOU IMPLANT
BENEATH THE PENILE SKIN.

36:01.433 --> 36:05.300
IT'S LIKE A BALLOON, BUT YOU
FILL IT WITH A STERILE FLUID

36:05.300 --> 36:10.400
TO GRADUALLY STRETCH THE SKIN
TO BE HARVESTED FOR A GRAFT.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.333
IS IT VERY PAINFUL?

36:12.333 --> 36:15.533
IT CAN BE PAINFUL BECAUSE --
BUT IT IS GRADUAL.

36:15.533 --> 36:19.333
HOW LONG WOULD I HAVE TO HAVE
THIS EXPANDER IN MY BODY?

36:19.333 --> 36:21.800
-Jazz and Jeanette: OOH.

36:21.800 --> 36:24.067
**

36:27.600 --> 36:29.667
WHY DO WE NEED TO DO
THE EXPANDER,

36:29.667 --> 36:31.733
THE CREAM, AND THE GRAFT?

36:31.733 --> 36:33.400
CAN'T WE JUST DO ONE
OR THE OTHER?

36:33.400 --> 36:36.567
WELL, THERE'S ONE OTHER THING
I WANT TO ADD.

36:36.567 --> 36:39.200
OH. OKAY.

36:39.200 --> 36:41.267
THERE'S A WAY
THAT WE CAN TAKE

36:41.267 --> 36:44.933
PART OF THE INSIDE STOMACH SACK
CALLED THE PERITONEUM.

36:44.933 --> 36:47.767
-OKAY.
-AND IT HAS A LOT OF ADVANTAGES.

36:47.767 --> 36:50.600
IT PRODUCES
ITS OWN SECRETIONS,

36:50.600 --> 36:52.833
SO IT PROVIDES LUBRICATION.

36:52.833 --> 36:57.867
BUT THE DOWNSIDE IS THAT
IT'S A RELATIVELY NEW PROCEDURE.

36:57.867 --> 37:00.200
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU
DONE THIS, YOU KNOW,

37:00.200 --> 37:02.433
STOMACH LINING OPERATION?

37:02.433 --> 37:03.800
PERSONALLY, I'VE ONLY
DONE IT THE --

37:03.800 --> 37:05.600
I'VE ONLY DONE IT ONE TIME.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.367
-MM-HMM.

37:07.367 --> 37:11.733
I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD IF YOU
VISITED DR. TING AT MOUNT SINAI.

37:11.733 --> 37:13.833
Dr. Bowers: DR. JESS TING
IS A FACULTY MEMBER

37:13.833 --> 37:15.933
AT MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL
IN NEW YORK.

37:15.933 --> 37:17.267
HE'S BECOME AN EXPERT

37:17.267 --> 37:19.633
IN TRANSGENDER MEDICINE
AND SURGERY,

37:19.633 --> 37:23.333
AND HE HAS USED PERITONEAL
LINING AS A GRAFT MATERIAL.

37:23.333 --> 37:25.433
Greg: AND HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE THEY UTILIZED THAT?

37:25.433 --> 37:28.067
WELL, I DON'T.... YOU KNOW,
I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT NUMBER.

37:28.067 --> 37:30.067
Greg: I'M NOT ECSTATIC THAT
WE HAVE TO GO TO NEW YORK

37:30.067 --> 37:32.567
TO CONSULT WITH
YET ANOTHER DOCTOR.

37:32.567 --> 37:34.433
ALSO, ANY TIME YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT

37:34.433 --> 37:38.067
NOT HAVING DONE
THE PROCEDURE OFTEN,

37:38.067 --> 37:39.433
I-I GET CONCERNED.

37:39.433 --> 37:41.533
ALSO,
IN PREPARING FOR SURGERY,

37:41.533 --> 37:43.400
WE KNOW WE'LL NEED
THERAPIST LETTERS.

37:43.400 --> 37:45.300
I HAVEN'T APPROACHED
THE THERAPIST YET

37:45.300 --> 37:46.800
ABOUT THE LETTERS
'CAUSE I DIDN'T...

37:46.800 --> 37:49.433
TO ME, IT WAS SUCH A NO-BRAINER
THAT WE'LL GET THESE LETTERS.

37:51.400 --> 37:52.700
YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE
THE LETTERS.

37:52.700 --> 37:54.433
IT'S JUST SIMPLY --
IT'S A REQUIREMENT.

37:54.433 --> 37:57.500
IT'S A DOUBLE-CHECK FOR HER
AND FOR YOU.

37:57.500 --> 37:59.267
WE REALLY ARE WALKING
A TIGHT ROPE.

37:59.267 --> 38:01.800
WE HAVE THE SKIN ISSUE.
WE HAVE THE ORGASM ISSUE.

38:01.800 --> 38:03.167
IT'S THE WEIGHT ISSUE.

38:03.167 --> 38:05.433
YOU KNOW, THESE ARE
REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS

38:05.433 --> 38:07.333
THAT WE DON'T WANT
TO LOOK BACK ON AND SAY,

38:07.333 --> 38:09.467
"GEE, I DON'T --
WE DIDN'T THINK OF THAT."

38:09.467 --> 38:11.500
-I'M A TOUGH CASE.
-YOU'RE A TOUGH CASE.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.167
YEAH.

38:13.167 --> 38:15.667
-Dr. Bowers: IT REALLY IS.

38:15.667 --> 38:17.300
I-I JUST -- YOU KNOW WHAT
I DON'T UNDERSTAND?

38:17.300 --> 38:20.867
PEOPLE -- PEOPLE THIN, YOU KNOW,
WE CHOOSE TO BE TRANSGENDER,

38:20.867 --> 38:22.467
WE CHOOSE TO GO DOWN
THIS JOURNEY,

38:22.467 --> 38:24.067
AND WE DO IT FOR "ATTENTION,"

38:24.067 --> 38:25.533
WE DO IT FOR ALL
THESE OTHER REASONS,

38:25.533 --> 38:28.333
BUT, LITERALLY, WHO WOULD
CHOOSE TO DO ALL THIS?

38:28.333 --> 38:30.967
-I TOTALLY AGREE.

38:30.967 --> 38:37.467
**

38:37.467 --> 38:39.867
-Greg: AFTER YOU.
-Jeanette: THANK YOU. UGH.

38:39.867 --> 38:42.667
SO MUCH INFORMATION RUNNING
THROUGH MY BRAIN.

38:42.667 --> 38:46.667
IT, LIKE, HURTS MY HEAD.

38:46.667 --> 38:47.967
Greg:
WE ARE OVERWHELMED.

38:47.967 --> 38:50.833
LIKE, SHE HIT US OVER THE HEAD
WITH A BRICK OR...

38:50.833 --> 38:52.367
-FOUR OR FIVE BRICKS.
-...A 2x4.

38:52.367 --> 38:54.167
I PERSONALLY FEEL
PRETTY STRONGLY

38:54.167 --> 38:58.067
THAT THE TISSUE EXPANDER SHOULD
BE A VERY, VERY LAST RESORT.

38:58.067 --> 38:59.333
BUT WHY DIDN'T
THAT ISSUE COME UP

38:59.333 --> 39:01.900
IN THE FOUR CONSULTATIONS
THAT WE HAD?

39:01.900 --> 39:04.367
I KNOW.
-Greg: THE TOPIC NEVER COME UP.

39:04.367 --> 39:08.900
WE HAVEN'T EVER HEARD MENTION
IN ANY OF THE CONSULTS

39:08.900 --> 39:11.667
PREVIOUSLY ABOUT
THE TISSUE EXPANDERS

39:11.667 --> 39:14.533
OR ABOUT
THE PERITONEAL LINING,

39:14.533 --> 39:16.600
AND IT'S A LITTLE
BAFFLING TO ME.

39:16.600 --> 39:19.700
A COUPLE MONTHS AGO,
WE PICKED A DOCTOR,

39:19.700 --> 39:22.933
AND NOW, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO MOVE FORWARD AT ALL.

39:22.933 --> 39:26.533
Jazz: IN SOME WAYS, I FEEL LIKE
MARCI OVERPROMISED

39:26.533 --> 39:28.933
WHAT SHE SAID SHE COULD DO
FOR ME SURGICALLY.

39:28.933 --> 39:31.800
I FEEL LIKE I'VE HAD TO MAKE
SO MANY CHOICES ALREADY,

39:31.800 --> 39:33.533
AND I'M JUST TIRED OF IT.

39:33.533 --> 39:36.067
I THOUGHT I WAS JUST GONNA GET
OPERATION,

39:36.067 --> 39:38.600
THE STANDARD VAGINOPLASTY,
BADA BOOM, BADA BANG.

39:38.600 --> 39:42.633
BUT NOW, I MIGHT HAVE TO GET
TISSUE EXPANDERS AND SKIN GRAFTS

39:42.633 --> 39:44.100
AND A PERITONEAL LINING,

39:44.100 --> 39:46.167
ALONG WITH THE VAGINOPLASTY
AND INVERSION,

39:46.167 --> 39:48.100
SO IT'S JUST SO MUCH GOING ON.

39:48.100 --> 39:49.633
WE STILL HAVE TO GET
THE TWO LETTERS,

39:49.633 --> 39:51.067
SO I THINK THE LETTERS
WILL BE FINE.

39:51.067 --> 39:53.100
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
YOU SHOULD WAIT ON THAT LETTER.

39:53.100 --> 39:54.567
YOU ACT LIKE IT'S A SNAP
OF THE FINGERS.

39:54.567 --> 39:55.967
BECAUSE I'VE TALKED TO TONS
OF PEOPLE ABOUT THE LETTERS.

39:55.967 --> 39:57.733
DAD, I REALLY THINK IT IS
A SNAP OF A FINGER.

39:57.733 --> 40:00.100
-IT'S NOT HARD.
-IT HAPPENS WITHIN A DAY'S TIME.

40:00.100 --> 40:02.600
IF B.M.I. IS SUCH
A BIG COMPONENT OF THIS,

40:02.600 --> 40:04.133
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE
THAT A DOCTOR

40:04.133 --> 40:06.100
IS GONNA WRITE A LETTER?

40:06.100 --> 40:07.533
HOW'D WE JUMP TO THAT?
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

40:07.533 --> 40:09.500
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, THAT'S ANOTHER COMPONENT

40:09.500 --> 40:11.167
TO BE ABLE TO TO HAVE
THE PROCEDURE.

40:11.167 --> 40:14.733
WHAT IF THEY SAY THAT, WELL,
IF A PERSON CAN'T CONTROL...

40:14.733 --> 40:16.200
THEIR EATING.

40:16.200 --> 40:18.700
...THEIR EATING, YOU KNOW, THEY
CAN'T GET THE LETTER EITHER.

40:18.700 --> 40:19.800
WE CAN'T -- NOTHING CAN GO --

40:19.800 --> 40:21.333
NO, I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

40:21.333 --> 40:25.433
JAZZ, YOU MUST BE ABLE TO GET
YOUR B.M.I. IN THE ZONE.

40:25.433 --> 40:28.733
YOU CAN'T HAVE THE PROCEDURE
IF YOU DON'T DO THAT.

40:28.733 --> 40:31.533
**

40:31.533 --> 40:33.067
WILL SHE REALLY DENY ME?

40:33.067 --> 40:34.600
-Jeanette: YEAH. YEAH.
-THAT WAS PRETTY CRYSTAL CLEAR.

40:34.600 --> 40:37.100
-Jeanette: IT WAS THE HOSPITAL.

40:37.100 --> 40:38.267
THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT YOU CAN DO.

40:38.267 --> 40:40.400
I CAN'T FIX IT, DAD.
I DON'T KNOW.

40:40.400 --> 40:42.033
I'LL TRY,
BUT IT'S SO HARD FOR ME

40:42.033 --> 40:44.333
'CAUSE I JUST LOVE FOOD,
AND I LIKE...

40:44.333 --> 40:45.500
-Jeanette: I DO, TOO.
-I LOVE TO BINGE EAT.

40:45.500 --> 40:48.067
-I LOVE IT.

40:48.067 --> 40:49.500
I JUST REALLY DO.

40:49.500 --> 40:51.333
I'M NOT SURE IF
MY PARENTS UNDERSTAND

40:51.333 --> 40:54.433
HOW DEEPLY CONNECTED I AM
TO FOOD.

40:54.433 --> 40:58.667
I HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM, AND WHILE
IT MAY SEEM EASY TO JUST

40:58.667 --> 41:02.367
CUT DOWN THE CALORIES, FOR ME,
IT'S A LOT MORE DIFFICULT

41:02.367 --> 41:04.100
'CAUSE I USE IT AS A COMFORT

41:04.100 --> 41:06.200
AND AS A WAY TO DEAL
WITH STRESS IN MY LIFE.

41:06.200 --> 41:09.067
WE'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING
IN OUR POWER TO MAKE YOU HAPPY

41:09.067 --> 41:11.733
AND TO MAKE YOU HEALTHY,
AND THAT'S IT.

41:11.733 --> 41:13.900
WE'RE A TEAM. OKAY?

41:13.900 --> 41:15.967
Greg: WHAT'S BECOME
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR HERE

41:15.967 --> 41:20.500
IS THAT JAZZ HAS AN ISSUE
JUST BEING HEALTHY IN GENERAL.

41:20.500 --> 41:22.167
Jeanette: WE CAN'T
LET IT GO ANY FURTHER.

41:22.167 --> 41:24.700
I DEFINITELY BELIEVE,
IF LEFT TO HER OWN DEVICES,

41:24.700 --> 41:26.367
THIS COULD GET WORSE.

41:26.367 --> 41:28.133
JAZZ DEFINITELY NEEDS HELP.

41:28.133 --> 41:34.500
**

41:34.500 --> 41:36.533
NEXT TIME ON "I AM JAZZ"...

41:36.533 --> 41:38.733
I HAVE TO LOSE 30 POUNDS

41:38.733 --> 41:40.833
BEFORE I CAN GET THE SURGERY.

41:40.833 --> 41:42.767
WHOO!

41:42.767 --> 41:45.067
OH, YOU THINK YOU'RE FASTER
THAN ME, HUH?

41:45.067 --> 41:47.867
YOU'RE A GOOD BIG BROTHER,
UT I LOVE GRIFFEN MORE.

41:47.867 --> 41:51.067
JAZZ, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GAIN OUT OF THIS PROCESS?

41:51.067 --> 41:52.333
SORRY. I ALWAYS CRY.

41:52.333 --> 41:56.567
I AM VISITING A HYPNOTHERAPIST
BECAUSE MY EATING ISSUES

41:56.567 --> 41:58.067
ARE BEYOND MY CONTROL.

41:58.067 --> 42:00.400
THIS IS
A PLACE OF HEALING.

42:00.400 --> 42:03.867
THIS IS A PLACE
OF TRANSFORMATION.

42:03.867 --> 42:06.233
Jeanette: WE GOT A CALL
FROM THIS RADIO PRODUCER.

42:06.233 --> 42:08.967
THEY HAVE A SHOW THAT
THEY WANT US TO GO ON,

42:08.967 --> 42:10.767
AND THEY'RE GONNA
BRING ON A SCIENTIST

42:10.767 --> 42:14.167
THAT HAS A BELIEF THAT
IT'S BEST NOT TO GO ON HORMONES

42:14.167 --> 42:16.833
UNTIL AFTER PUBERTY
'CAUSE THEY THINK

42:16.833 --> 42:19.233
80% OF THE KIDS ARE GONNA
CHANGE THEIR MIND.

42:19.233 --> 42:21.133
Jazz: THE PODCAST IS ABOUT
TO BEGIN,

42:21.133 --> 42:24.233
AND I AM DEFINITELY FEELING
A LITTLE TENSE.

42:24.233 --> 42:26.667
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
TRANSITIONING BEFORE PUBERTY?

42:26.667 --> 42:29.167
Woman: Right now, we have
no evidence that people are,

42:29.167 --> 42:30.567
in fact, born this way.
