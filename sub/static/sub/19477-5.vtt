01:58.320 --> 02:01.840
AFGHANISTAN SOLDIER
SUSPECTED

02:01.920 --> 02:04.840
Johanne? Johanne!

02:04.920 --> 02:09.520
We need to check
if someone's outside!

02:09.600 --> 02:11.680
Jesus...

02:13.800 --> 02:17.400
Rikard?
Rikard, you have to get up.

02:17.480 --> 02:21.840
Come on.
Get up and pack your bag.

02:21.920 --> 02:26.080
Go with mum and be nice.
If someone asks, I'm out running.

02:26.160 --> 02:28.240
Isn't it a little early for school?

02:38.560 --> 02:42.040
-Two civilian cars.
-Fuck!

02:42.120 --> 02:46.040
-What are you doing?
-What? Get my phone.

02:50.080 --> 02:53.520
-Don't get the door, okay?
-I won't.

02:57.880 --> 03:01.600
Erling, where are you going?
Erling?

03:01.680 --> 03:03.840
Where are you going?

03:03.920 --> 03:07.160
To the city centre. I'll text you.

03:08.320 --> 03:09.520
Okay?

03:33.840 --> 03:35.920
Assignment.

03:40.320 --> 03:43.000
-Hi.
-Hi.

03:44.760 --> 03:47.280
Yesterday around 1500 hours,

03:47.360 --> 03:51.440
Sharif Zamani was observed
entering a house

03:51.520 --> 03:58.240
where Mullah Kaliq is staying
with Abdul Kader.

03:58.320 --> 04:03.040
The assignment is to extract
Mullah Kaliq and Abdul Kader alive.

04:03.120 --> 04:06.520
And to eliminate Sharif Zamani.

04:08.320 --> 04:11.640
Zamani is behind several IED killings.

04:11.720 --> 04:13.920
Including Sigurd's.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.399
That's why he's on the JPEL list.

04:16.480 --> 04:19.720
This is part of
Operation Enduring Freedom.

04:19.800 --> 04:23.000
NATO has given this to us
because of our results.

04:23.080 --> 04:26.520
The Americans will transport you.
You'll be joined by two of their best.

06:38.440 --> 06:44.320
Quiet! Quiet! Calm down!
Sit down! Sit down!

07:54.440 --> 07:56.440
Hi.

07:58.720 --> 08:01.640
-Some school day today.
-Yeah.

08:01.720 --> 08:03.920
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

08:10.200 --> 08:13.360
-Are you doing alright?
-Yes.

08:14.800 --> 08:19.200
They're still waiting at home.
I said I was dropping Rikard off.

08:19.280 --> 08:20.680
AFGHANISTAN SOLDIER
SUSPECTED

08:20.760 --> 08:22.320
God damn it.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.720
He can't go to school today.

08:31.800 --> 08:36.440
Today, tomorrow
and who fucking knows for how long.

08:36.520 --> 08:38.159
And what about you?

08:38.240 --> 08:42.039
I was asked to come in at work at once.

08:44.680 --> 08:46.680
We'll figure it out.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.880
Yeah.

09:18.920 --> 09:21.440
What do you know?

09:21.520 --> 09:26.120
The only thing I know is that he
hasn't killed anyone with intent.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.720
He has.

09:27.800 --> 09:31.000
Unless you use "intent"
differently than me.

09:31.080 --> 09:34.320
Maybe you mean
"hasn't killed off-duty."

09:34.400 --> 09:38.520
And I desperately hope
you're right about that.

09:40.040 --> 09:43.800
I don't understand
how the press found out.

09:43.880 --> 09:46.040
We're checking that.

09:47.480 --> 09:50.480
What are we going to do with you?

09:50.560 --> 09:55.920
As your Secretariat Leader, I remind you
that I'm within my trial period.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.320
So not renewing my contract
shouldn't pose any problems.

10:04.440 --> 10:07.200
Do you see that as the only solution?

10:07.280 --> 10:08.760
Yes.

10:10.640 --> 10:13.760
You had to make a swift decision.

10:13.840 --> 10:16.320
You didn't hire me in person.

10:16.400 --> 10:20.240
I was recommended.
You'll review the application process.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.800
I got you from
Peace and Reconciliation.

10:22.880 --> 10:25.840
From the Publication section.

10:25.920 --> 10:28.360
You would also like to add that

10:28.440 --> 10:33.600
the suspicion towards Erling Riiser
in no way is confirmed yet.

10:35.120 --> 10:38.640
Do you think you could
write that down for me?

10:57.760 --> 10:59.240
-Hi.
-Hi.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.520
Please.

11:04.480 --> 11:09.000
Why didn't you tell us that
Erling Riiser killed Sharif Zamani?

11:09.080 --> 11:11.880
Because the order didn't come from us.

11:11.960 --> 11:14.440
This person must have known that Erling

11:14.520 --> 11:18.360
was briefed by me
when Zamani was on the kill list.

11:18.440 --> 11:22.840
That narrows it down.
Which matters are most pressing?

11:22.920 --> 11:26.320
I was to meet Zamani.
I met him in Afghanistan.

11:26.400 --> 11:30.200
The Agency for Development Cooperation
talked to him

11:30.280 --> 11:34.000
about oil on his land.
And he had ties to the Taliban.

11:34.080 --> 11:38.760
If this is leaked, our soldiers
will be in danger in Afghanistan.

11:38.840 --> 11:42.520
I know. I have sent a request
to silence the press.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.680
-A derogation?
-Yes.

11:44.760 --> 11:49.520
That'll do it for them,
but for us it's too late.

11:49.600 --> 11:55.680
We have a Spec Ops soldier
on the front pages, accused of murder.

11:55.760 --> 12:00.800
The US Secretary of Defence
is coming to meet some of our soldiers,

12:00.880 --> 12:03.760
and one of them is Erling Riiser.

12:04.760 --> 12:08.640
-What is Johanne doing?
-She's clearing her desk.

12:08.720 --> 12:10.520
We need her in the game.

12:10.600 --> 12:14.720
There can only be one
acceptable headline tomorrow:

12:14.800 --> 12:17.400
"The hero from the car park."

12:23.560 --> 12:28.360
-What do the papers say?
-Something you shouldn't believe.

12:28.440 --> 12:31.240
-Why not?
-Not all they write is true.

12:31.320 --> 12:35.320
But I saw it on TV.
You were shooting because of the war.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.480
Everyone knows soldiers shoot.

12:37.560 --> 12:41.880
Almost everyone knows you're a soldier.
My class knows.

12:41.960 --> 12:47.160
-But that's not the headlines today.
-Then what did they say?

12:56.080 --> 12:59.600
FATAL STABBING IN OSLO CITY CENTRE

12:59.680 --> 13:03.760
-Why are there squares on your face?
-So that I won't be recognized.

13:05.480 --> 13:09.080
-But I do.
-Those who know me will recognise me.

13:09.160 --> 13:12.040
That's why you're not in school today.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.720
Did you kill a man?

13:18.240 --> 13:19.720
Yes.

13:23.640 --> 13:29.680
-What did he do?
-He tried to kill his wife.

13:29.760 --> 13:33.360
-Why?
-Because...

13:33.440 --> 13:37.000
It's kind of complicated, Rikard.

13:37.080 --> 13:41.480
It's because...
Because she made him feel stupid.

13:41.560 --> 13:46.560
Because he lost what he calls "honour".

13:46.640 --> 13:49.080
What kind of honour?

13:49.160 --> 13:54.280
That's difficult to understand
for both you and me.

13:54.360 --> 14:00.280
-Is he involved in the war?
-In many ways, yes.

14:00.360 --> 14:03.960
Has the war come to Norway now?

14:04.040 --> 14:07.040
No. It hasn't.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.800
You look scary.

14:36.680 --> 14:39.480
Johanne, we need your help.

14:39.560 --> 14:43.840
-I just handed in my resignation.
-Not accepted.

14:43.920 --> 14:47.560
I'll have to ask you to run a few errands.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.920
God damn it!

15:19.400 --> 15:21.640
-Hi!
-Hi.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.640
-Good to see you.
-You too.

15:24.720 --> 15:26.200
How are you?

15:26.280 --> 15:30.320
-Do you have time?
-Sure. Come on.

15:40.080 --> 15:43.440
Hello. This is Johanne Riiser.

15:43.520 --> 15:48.240
Hi. Could you meet me at the
Stop the Presses pub in 45 minutes?

15:48.320 --> 15:50.960
Great. Thanks.

16:13.400 --> 16:17.080
-Call me when you're done.
-Yeah.

16:40.680 --> 16:43.280
Hey! Hi, horsey!

16:55.520 --> 16:57.120
Dad?

16:58.560 --> 17:00.160
Dad?

17:04.920 --> 17:07.280
Dad?

17:07.359 --> 17:09.680
He's over here!

17:13.240 --> 17:15.800
-Rikard?
-Yes.

17:15.880 --> 17:19.160
Are you okay?

17:19.240 --> 17:21.480
-Are you here?
-Hey!

17:21.560 --> 17:24.640
-You're coming with us.
-I'm staying!

17:24.720 --> 17:26.240
Fuck...

17:26.319 --> 17:30.680
Rikard. Bring me what's
inside that vacuum cleaner.

17:30.760 --> 17:33.720
Stay down. Calm yourself.

17:35.520 --> 17:38.000
Lie down, please.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.440
Come here.

17:43.440 --> 17:46.480
-Here you go.
-Dad.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.880
That's enough.

17:58.920 --> 18:01.800
Let's carry grandpa inside.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.640
Okay. On the count of three.

18:04.720 --> 18:07.720
One, two, three!

18:07.800 --> 18:10.800
There. Let's go.

18:20.520 --> 18:26.160
-What's wrong with grandpa?
-It's called withdrawal symptoms.

18:26.240 --> 18:29.360
He's trying to get well.

18:33.600 --> 18:38.400
-Maybe we should call an ambulance?
-No, it'll be fine.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.800
Are you okay, grandpa?

18:47.880 --> 18:51.520
Rikard? Take care of grandpa for a bit.

18:51.600 --> 18:55.600
If his breathing gets worse,
come and get me.

19:07.640 --> 19:12.320
-Are you going for a ride?
-I'd love to. It's been a while.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.640
Hey. Come here.

19:19.840 --> 19:22.520
How's the boy?

19:22.600 --> 19:26.600
-He's been briefed.
-Good.

19:27.880 --> 19:30.840
-Do I have to turn myself in?
-Yes.

19:30.920 --> 19:36.840
Keep it short. No backstory from
Afghanistan, no knowledge of Sharif.

19:36.920 --> 19:40.720
-I need to call Johanne...
-No time. She's occupied.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.720
-Can he stay here?
-It's a really bad time.

19:43.800 --> 19:46.240
He's detoxifying.

19:46.320 --> 19:49.480
-From what?
-The same as before. Heroin.

19:49.560 --> 19:52.400
-I thought that was done with.
-Me too.

19:52.480 --> 19:54.880
Dad? Grandpa is very ill.

19:57.600 --> 20:01.600
Give Ekeberg some fodder
so he can say hi to Linette.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.280
-Hi.
-Rikard.

20:04.360 --> 20:07.040
-JÃ¸rund.
-This is Linette.

20:07.120 --> 20:09.280
Give her these.

20:41.880 --> 20:44.920
It'll be fine. I'll get better.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.920
Slowly.

21:44.440 --> 21:47.480
Rikard has to stay here today.

21:47.560 --> 21:49.760
What did you say?

21:49.840 --> 21:54.840
-Rikard has to stay here today.
-Sure, no problem.

21:54.920 --> 21:59.400
Johanne or I will come and pick him up.

21:59.480 --> 22:00.960
Good.

22:01.040 --> 22:06.240
I'll change and take a shower.
Maybe we can go for a ride.

22:11.920 --> 22:13.560
-Rikard?
-Yes?

22:13.640 --> 22:16.440
-Grandpa feels much better.
-Okay?

22:16.520 --> 22:19.360
I have to go to the city. Alright?

22:19.440 --> 22:21.560
Say goodbye. I'm leaving.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.960
-Bye.
-Bye. Take care of our guests.

22:25.040 --> 22:28.320
-Goodbye, Rikard. Nice to meet you.
-Bye.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.400
You have a nice boy.

22:34.760 --> 22:38.400
-What a fucking mess.
-Yes, but we'll fix it.

22:38.480 --> 22:44.040
I really want to find out
who texted you. That's the real problem.

22:54.080 --> 22:56.080
Hello.

22:58.440 --> 23:01.320
Right now, the Police Security Service

23:01.400 --> 23:05.400
are confiscating any information
your newspaper has

23:05.480 --> 23:09.400
on Erling Riiser,
Sharif Zamani or related matters.

23:09.480 --> 23:11.400
-Are you joking?
-Not at all.

23:11.480 --> 23:14.120
-You know where I work?
-Yes, but...

23:14.200 --> 23:19.280
-There's no need to threaten me.
-I'm not. It's happening.

23:19.360 --> 23:23.480
We reserve the right to act
when national security is at stake.

23:23.560 --> 23:27.480
Your editor knows.
The Press Complaints Commission too.

23:27.560 --> 23:32.880
I've notified all editorial offices
that derogation is in effect.

23:34.760 --> 23:38.280
We have a story
about one of your Spec Ops,

23:38.360 --> 23:41.720
who killed someone in a car park in Oslo.

23:41.800 --> 23:44.960
It doesn't look good.
But that doesn't mean...

23:45.040 --> 23:47.960
Allow me to be hypothetical:

23:48.040 --> 23:53.160
The Prime Minister is in secret talks
with terrorists regarding a threat.

23:53.240 --> 23:56.560
You publish photos
from this secret meeting.

23:56.640 --> 24:00.760
The Parliament gets bombed,
the Prime Minister is killed.

24:00.840 --> 24:03.640
Do you still think it's justifiable?

24:03.720 --> 24:06.840
-That's just...
-I need you to understand

24:06.920 --> 24:11.960
that today you are
responsible for your country.

24:12.040 --> 24:14.520
Do you understand what I'm saying?

24:14.600 --> 24:17.920
-Yes?
-Yes. Okay.

24:18.800 --> 24:23.160
I thought you wanted to meet
because we exposed your husband?

24:23.240 --> 24:25.240
You know?

24:48.760 --> 24:51.160
-Hi.
-Hi.

24:51.240 --> 24:56.920
-I thought Johanne was coming.
-No, I'm afraid it's just me.

24:57.920 --> 25:01.280
-Just you?
-Yes.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.360
Hi.

25:11.480 --> 25:13.760
You did great in the interview.

25:13.840 --> 25:16.320
-You think so? Thanks.
-You did.

25:16.400 --> 25:18.920
-Thank you.
-Very well.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.160
I just have to finish...

25:22.240 --> 25:25.880
I brought you some Bamsemums.

25:25.960 --> 25:28.720
Bamsemums. Thanks.

25:28.800 --> 25:30.600
It's probably...

25:30.680 --> 25:34.640
-Just what I wanted.
-Just what you wanted.

25:36.400 --> 25:40.720
I'm almost done.
Just give me a few minutes.

25:45.160 --> 25:48.040
Does it hurt?

25:48.120 --> 25:52.640
Do you have any pain?
Do your shoulders hurt?

25:57.960 --> 26:02.400
I just heard it was common when you...

26:02.480 --> 26:07.560
Your shoulders can feel stiff
because you compensate for...

26:08.560 --> 26:12.160
-Where did you hear that?
-I just read it.

26:12.240 --> 26:14.920
Okay. Did you google it?

26:15.000 --> 26:18.560
I did google it, actually.

26:20.160 --> 26:24.240
But do you? Are you..?

26:27.360 --> 26:29.920
Does this hurt?

26:31.360 --> 26:33.600
Hey... Thanks.

26:33.680 --> 26:36.680
You don't have to. It's okay.

26:48.520 --> 26:50.080
I'm really sorry.

26:50.160 --> 26:55.600
There's an aquarium in the lobby
if you want some entertainment...

27:01.720 --> 27:05.000
I was thinking, if you want to...

27:05.080 --> 27:09.080
Come with me to town
and have dinner with us.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.240
-Us?
-Wasima and I.

27:11.320 --> 27:15.120
-Isn't her presence classified?
-Yes, of course.

27:19.520 --> 27:21.320
You know what..?

27:21.400 --> 27:24.960
-I'll pass. I have a lot to do.
-What?

27:25.040 --> 27:29.280
-Huh?
-What? What do you have to do?

27:30.400 --> 27:35.160
Do? I've got new prostheses.
I have to exercise three times a day.

27:35.240 --> 27:38.920
-If not, I'll never get out of here.
-Yeah.

27:41.960 --> 27:44.640
How is it working out?

27:49.400 --> 27:51.280
It's...

27:51.360 --> 27:55.040
It's going slowly, but I'm doing well.

27:57.440 --> 28:02.040
Where are you going to live afterwards?

28:02.120 --> 28:04.320
I don't know. I have no idea.

28:04.400 --> 28:09.840
Maybe in a council flat, or at some
retirement home. Who fucking knows.

28:12.600 --> 28:17.080
Alright. I'm done, so you can have it.

28:19.120 --> 28:22.080
-Say hi to the others.
-Yeah.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.280
I'll see you later.

28:24.360 --> 28:26.760
It was nice of you to come.

28:35.080 --> 28:38.560
I feel the same about you as before.

28:39.560 --> 28:42.320
I want you to know that.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.120
Are you going back?

28:54.200 --> 28:56.480
Yes.

28:56.560 --> 28:59.280
Me too.

28:59.360 --> 29:03.080
It's what I've trained for.
It's what I know.

29:03.160 --> 29:06.120
All those hours working on...

29:06.200 --> 29:09.840
Strategy, culture,
language, psychology...

29:09.920 --> 29:15.120
Everything we're proud of and which
makes us superior. I know that stuff.

29:15.200 --> 29:19.640
Now that I'm reinstated,
I want to apply for another tour.

29:20.720 --> 29:23.600
It would be nice if you came to dinner.

29:23.680 --> 29:28.400
-Do you have a stair glider for me?
-No, but I can carry you.

29:35.960 --> 29:38.040
-Hey.
-Yeah?

29:38.120 --> 29:42.800
Hurry up. Erling is in trouble.
You have to deliver that thing.

29:42.880 --> 29:45.440
-I will.
-Bye.

30:28.520 --> 30:30.680
We sent a patrol to your house today.

30:31.400 --> 30:35.280
-Your wife said you were out for a run.
-That is correct.

30:35.360 --> 30:37.440
It must have been a long run.

30:37.520 --> 30:42.480
I ran down to Vippetangen at the port
where I met my wife and son.

30:42.560 --> 30:48.720
Then I drove my son to the family farm,
because I didn't want him to...

30:48.800 --> 30:53.000
Hear that his father
is a murderer at school today.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.160
Did you kill Sharif Zamani?

30:56.240 --> 30:57.720
Yes.

30:59.680 --> 31:02.640
Why didn't you turn yourself in at once?

31:02.720 --> 31:06.920
I'm afraid I'm not allowed
to answer that.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.680
-Why?
-I can't say.

31:08.760 --> 31:11.800
Surely, you're here to tell us something.

31:11.880 --> 31:15.880
Absolutely. But that piece
of information is classified.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.440
I see.

31:19.440 --> 31:22.760
You're just back from Afghanistan.

31:22.840 --> 31:26.160
The deceased arrived
just a few hours after you.

31:26.240 --> 31:28.280
Did you know the deceased?

31:29.280 --> 31:32.520
-That's classified.
-It seems likely.

31:34.640 --> 31:36.960
We have footage from the murder.

31:37.040 --> 31:40.720
Why were you at the car park
where you killed Zamani?

31:40.800 --> 31:43.560
My father has a...

31:44.560 --> 31:46.920
Heroin addiction.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.720
-Your father?
-Yes.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.960
What's your father's name?

31:52.040 --> 31:54.800
Gunnar Riiser.

31:54.880 --> 31:57.560
Riiser the jockey?

31:59.280 --> 32:00.960
He's an addict?

32:01.040 --> 32:04.480
He fell off his horse a few years ago.

32:04.560 --> 32:09.640
Yes, I remember that.
It was a brutal fall.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.520
I talked to him earlier.

32:11.600 --> 32:15.920
I thought he was going into town to score.
That's why I went there.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.160
Let's go back.
You're at the Concert Hall.

32:19.240 --> 32:22.440
-You contacted your father?
-On a whim.

32:22.520 --> 32:28.680
It felt wrong to listen to classical music
while my father was dying in an alley.

32:28.760 --> 32:32.520
On my way to him
I ran into the three Afghans.

32:32.600 --> 32:36.520
-Can anything or anyone confirm this?
-No.

32:38.640 --> 32:44.200
He... It turns out he had
everything he needed at the farm.

32:44.280 --> 32:46.160
He never went into town.

32:46.240 --> 32:49.000
I could have enjoyed the concert,

32:49.080 --> 32:52.920
but then we would have had
a dead woman on our hands now.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.840
What happened to the woman?

32:57.920 --> 33:00.920
-I made sure she was treated.
-Where?

33:01.000 --> 33:03.360
That's classified.

33:04.360 --> 33:08.840
We'll start on a formal charge sheet.
You may wait here.

33:17.080 --> 33:19.880
You're summoned
to a private press conference.

33:19.960 --> 33:22.320
You cannot give me an order.

33:22.400 --> 33:26.480
It's not an order.
Just some well-meaning advice.

33:26.560 --> 33:28.960
Do you have a few minutes?

33:31.920 --> 33:35.720
This is for your eyes only.
No one else's.

33:36.600 --> 33:40.000
The woman in the car park
is Wasima Zamani.

33:40.080 --> 33:43.040
She was married to the deceased.

33:43.120 --> 33:49.400
We were ordered to save her life
in Afghanistan and get her to Norway.

33:56.560 --> 34:01.520
This will be considered self-defence
in the event of a trial.

34:04.400 --> 34:08.719
The soldier saved her life,
and that's the end of it.

34:17.159 --> 34:20.320
I knew he wasn't there by coincidence.

34:20.400 --> 34:23.960
Just tell the press what happened.

34:24.040 --> 34:26.760
A woman nearly got murdered in public.

34:26.840 --> 34:30.440
A man with military training saved her.

34:30.520 --> 34:33.320
The man is a former coastal ranger.

34:33.400 --> 34:37.880
-I thought he was Spec Ops.
-Our soldiers are secret.

34:37.960 --> 34:42.280
I'm very uncomfortable with
having to lie to the press.

34:42.360 --> 34:45.400
You're not lying. It was self-defence.

34:45.480 --> 34:46.960
Still.

34:47.040 --> 34:50.920
Then just look forward
to soaking in the tub

34:51.000 --> 34:55.840
with an ice-cold gin and tonic
and feel the discomfort fade away.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.920
Take this.

35:16.600 --> 35:20.880
-Was Rikard alright at the farm?
-Yes.

35:25.840 --> 35:28.840
What about you?
What are you thinking?

35:29.840 --> 35:35.720
It wasn't easy waking up to
my husband on the front page as a...

35:35.800 --> 35:38.640
Murderer.

35:38.720 --> 35:41.200
I'm sorry, I'm just...

35:42.280 --> 35:46.000
I saw you killing him in two seconds flat
on that video.

35:46.080 --> 35:48.240
That's hard to take.

35:48.320 --> 35:52.120
The info video for next of kin
wasn't quite as informative as that.

35:53.600 --> 35:56.600
-I'm sorry.
-I understand.

35:57.760 --> 36:00.360
Remember the first time we talked?

36:00.440 --> 36:04.200
After the cinema,
when we went to your place?

36:05.520 --> 36:08.760
I stupidly asked
how many you'd slept with.

36:08.840 --> 36:12.080
I thought you'd say four or five,
but you...

36:12.160 --> 36:15.800
You hesitated,
because you couldn't remember.

36:15.880 --> 36:18.480
Yeah. I thought I'd ruined it.

36:21.280 --> 36:24.760
I don't know how many I've killed.

36:25.880 --> 36:28.200
Or assisted in killing.

36:29.640 --> 36:32.320
I don't know anymore.

36:32.400 --> 36:35.560
What you saw in that video,

36:35.640 --> 36:37.640
that is my job.

36:41.440 --> 36:46.680
I have called in air strikes,
bombed villages, I've...

36:46.760 --> 36:51.200
Thrown grenades into houses.

36:53.960 --> 36:56.400
How does that feel?

36:57.400 --> 36:59.840
It doesn't.

37:02.320 --> 37:06.000
What about Jon Petter and Sigurd?

37:07.320 --> 37:11.840
It's like a heavy lump
I can't seem to get rid of.

37:11.920 --> 37:15.160
I can't justify anything.

37:15.240 --> 37:19.000
I can't justify why I have
so much sympathy for them

37:19.080 --> 37:22.920
and nothing
for those I've taken out myself.

37:34.920 --> 37:38.160
The last time I was there...

37:39.240 --> 37:42.280
I took out a little boy.

38:27.720 --> 38:30.840
"STABBING" WAS HEROIC DEED

38:30.920 --> 38:33.040
SOLDIER SAVES WOMAN FROM
EXECUTION FOR SECOND TIME

38:43.480 --> 38:47.760
Can you see if everything
is ready upstairs? Thank you.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.480
-Hello.
-How are you?

39:05.560 --> 39:07.960
Good. You?

39:08.040 --> 39:11.600
-Good to see you.
-And you.

39:11.680 --> 39:14.960
-Are you ready?
-Of course. Always.

39:20.880 --> 39:23.360
Hello, boys. Good to see you.

39:23.440 --> 39:25.200
You too. Why are you here?

39:25.280 --> 39:29.320
I've known Randall
since El Salvador in the '90s.

39:29.400 --> 39:32.760
We certainly had our political battles.

39:32.840 --> 39:35.280
-Who won?
-He first, then I.

39:35.360 --> 39:39.720
Often, a world power
finances friendly guerrillas,

39:39.800 --> 39:43.320
war breaks out
and tens of thousands die.

39:43.400 --> 39:46.280
This creates
unexpected constellations.

39:46.360 --> 39:50.440
He moves out,
equipment arrives and I move in.

39:50.520 --> 39:54.280
-And the world power is still out?
-No, it changes clothes.

39:54.360 --> 39:56.920
I'm going to talk to my wife.

39:58.760 --> 40:03.800
-Why didn't you say goodbye?
-I didn't want to wake you.

40:03.880 --> 40:09.120
Did I scare you yesterday?
Because that wasn't my intention.

40:09.200 --> 40:11.720
I know that, Erling.

40:13.040 --> 40:17.600
Maybe we can talk about it later?
I'm busy here.

40:17.680 --> 40:19.520
Okay.

40:23.840 --> 40:27.400
-Does anyone want another drink?
-Yeah, why not.

41:00.320 --> 41:03.080
Do you want to speak
before the music?

41:03.160 --> 41:07.080
-Music first. It'll lighten the mood.
-Indeed.

44:28.800 --> 44:31.840
Eliminate Sharif Zamani.

44:55.400 --> 44:59.400
