YOU CAN HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT
WITH A LITTLE TRAINING.

AND I CAN SHOW YOU HOW.

THIS IS YOUR
NEXT LESSON.

17:35.455 --> 17:36.521
BE AGGRESSIVE.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.289
TELL THAT GUY TO TAKE A HIKE.

DO YOU WANT TO TAKE
A HIKE WITH ME?

17:41.027 --> 17:42.527

SOME BURIED TREASURE.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.444
SPONGEBOB, YOU'LL
NEVER GET IT RIGHT.

17:59.446 --> 18:03.047
TELL THAT GUY YOU KNOW KARATE
AND YOU'LL TIE HIM IN A KNOT

PLANKTON, ALL MY ASSERTING
HAS DRIVEN EVERYBODY AWAY.

20:43.776 --> 20:44.442
EXACTLY.

20:44.444 --> 20:47.311
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
EVERYONE WOULD LEAVE.

20:47.313 --> 20:48.946
OOPS.

20:50.750 --> 20:51.616
MEGA BUCKET!

20:51.618 --> 20:56.320
YOU USED ME
FOR LAND DEVELOPMENT.

20:56.322 --> 20:58.289
THAT WASN'T NICE.

20:58.291 --> 21:01.926
HAVEN'T YOU FIGURED
IT OUT, SPONGEBOB?

21:01.928 --> 21:03.527
NICE GUYS FINISH LAST.

21:03.529 --> 21:07.265
ONLY AGGRESSIVE PEOPLE
CONQUER THE WORLD.

21:07.267 --> 21:08.899
(<i> evil laughter</i> )

21:08.901 --> 21:09.634
WELL...

21:09.636 --> 21:14.305

21:42.368 --> 21:44.201
BUTTERFLY KISSES.

21:44.203 --> 21:46.504
I... CAN'T TAKE IT.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.005
IT'S TOO CUTE.

21:48.007 --> 21:51.142
IT'S, IT'S DISGUSTING!

21:53.012 --> 21:54.111
WHAT HAPPENED?

21:54.113 --> 21:58.516

22:02.989 --> 22:06.390
SPONGEBOB, STOP--

22:06.392 --> 22:11.062
YOUR KINDNESS
IS BRINGING EVERYBODY BACK.

22:12.598 --> 22:13.497
GET BACK!

22:13.499 --> 22:15.132

22:34.387 --> 22:35.152
GEE, PLANKTON.

22:35.154 --> 22:37.154
I'M SORRY ABOUT
THE CHUM BUCKET.

22:37.156 --> 22:38.556
FORGET ABOUT THAT.

22:38.558 --> 22:44.528
I JUST CAN'T TAKE SO MUCH
KINDNESS AT ONE SITTING.

22:44.530 --> 22:47.765
