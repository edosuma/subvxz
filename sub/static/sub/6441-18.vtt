00:15.349 --> 00:17.408
Hello, gentlemen.

00:17.585 --> 00:20.053
- Hey, Chloe.
- What are you doing to those poor citrus?

00:20.221 --> 00:23.019
Apparently, there's enough acid
in them to act as a battery.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.987
How very Survivor of you.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.650
What are you gonna call it,
a Clockwork Orange?

00:27.828 --> 00:30.092
Don't you wish
you were the first one to say that?

00:34.268 --> 00:36.930
- Sure, you can use our outlet.
- Thanks.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.734
What's up with that guy?

00:41.976 --> 00:45.468
His name is Cyrus Krupp.
He transferred in a couple of weeks ago.

00:45.646 --> 00:49.912
They asked me to give him the new-student
tour, but he said he wouldn't be here long.

00:50.151 --> 00:53.587
Maybe that's why he's trying so hard
to win friends and influence people.

00:55.823 --> 00:58.018
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.568
What are you doing, man?

01:14.175 --> 01:15.437
Hey, what are you doing?

01:17.211 --> 01:19.873
Hey, freak, why don't you jack in
somewhere else?

01:20.047 --> 01:21.708
Give me those.

01:23.350 --> 01:26.046
Check it out, man.
Loser's listening to a dial tone.

01:26.220 --> 01:28.882
You don't have the capacity
to comprehend that sound.

01:29.056 --> 01:30.921
You calling me stupid?

01:31.092 --> 01:33.856
Let's just say you're not one
of mankind's brightest lights.

01:35.463 --> 01:38.660
- Hey! Don't damage my transmitter!
- Don't damage his transmitter!

01:38.833 --> 01:40.130
The transmitter!

01:40.868 --> 01:43.336
Guys, why don't you
just leave him alone.

01:47.408 --> 01:50.309
- Stay out of it, Kent.
- Yeah, back off, Kent.

01:51.078 --> 01:55.208
I don't want to hurt you, Kyle.
Just give my transmitter back.

01:57.051 --> 01:59.485
- Get out of here, freak.
- I'm warning you.

02:03.090 --> 02:04.352
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

02:04.525 --> 02:06.356
Oh, yeah.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.660
- Oh, now he's crying.
- Oh, yeah.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.559
- That's right. Go home to Mama.
- Bye.

02:12.066 --> 02:14.398
- Who's crying now?
- Don't damage the transmitter.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.536
Now, leave me alone!

03:41.188 --> 03:44.521
Hey. Tyson, haven't seen you
in a long time.

03:44.692 --> 03:49.129
I finally got some time off from the Talon,
I thought I'd take him out for a good run.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.422
He hasn't been out much since Whitney.

03:56.670 --> 04:00.333
Chloe told me what happened
at the electronics lab. Pretty wild.

04:00.507 --> 04:03.908
It was definitely weird.
It's like Cyrus is in his own world.

04:04.078 --> 04:06.273
Takes teenage alienation
to a whole new level.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.481
Well, we all have our ways
of escaping from our lives.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.744
I ride, Chloe writes and you...

04:15.122 --> 04:19.115
You do incredibly strenuous farm chores
by yourself.

04:30.404 --> 04:33.100
- Thought some air would do him good.
- Did you call the vet?

04:33.274 --> 04:36.072
Yeah, he doesn't know
what's wrong with him.

04:36.243 --> 04:38.438
Chalked it up to old age.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.671
Whitney's mom wants to sell him.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.112
She can't afford to stable him anymore.

04:47.254 --> 04:49.279
Why don't you board him here?

04:49.823 --> 04:51.586
Would your parents be okay with it?

04:53.160 --> 04:56.493
I don't see why not.
It is a farm, after all.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.763
Thanks.

05:07.508 --> 05:12.912
- Why didn't you tell me about it?
- I thought I bought every copy in Smallville.

05:14.782 --> 05:19.378
Helen, I've been living
with this kind of thing my whole life.

05:19.553 --> 05:22.647
I'm sorry they've come after you too.
I was trying to protect you.

05:23.090 --> 05:25.115
You can't, Lex. It's not just the paper.

05:25.292 --> 05:29.524
I mean, people have been treating me
differently ever since I started dating you.

05:29.697 --> 05:32.359
I've sacrificed so much to get where I am.

05:32.633 --> 05:35.625
And now your reputation is being trashed
by rumor and innuendo?

05:37.805 --> 05:40.501
- Is that why you haven't moved in?
- I already told you...

05:40.674 --> 05:43.472
...my lease isn't up yet,
and I haven't had time to pack.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.236
Okay.

05:47.715 --> 05:50.240
I'll pay to break your lease...

05:50.584 --> 05:53.382
...and I'll have movers
at your place in an hour.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.856
What's stopping you now?

05:58.425 --> 06:00.484
I need to do this on my own schedule.

06:05.065 --> 06:09.798
I want you to know
that I completely believe in us...

06:10.237 --> 06:12.797
...but if you want to back out...

06:13.173 --> 06:14.765
...I'll understand.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.246
Can you make it two hours?

06:39.032 --> 06:41.159
Hey, Kent.

06:41.668 --> 06:44.068
I know your secret.

06:45.272 --> 06:47.467
Lana told me
you're boarding Whitney's horse.

06:47.641 --> 06:50.610
Oh, yeah, that. Right.

06:50.778 --> 06:54.179
- You made her year, you know.
- Well, Tyson's really important to her.

06:54.348 --> 06:57.215
She didn't want another part
of her past just taken away.

06:57.384 --> 06:59.875
And she'll be here every day.
Just like old times.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.647
There's nothing romantic
about mucking out horse stalls.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.415
Clark.

07:04.591 --> 07:08.425
- I see the electronics lab is still closed.
- The fire marshals are investigating...

07:08.595 --> 07:10.119
...Cyrus' pyrotechnics.

07:10.297 --> 07:15.234
Did you know Principal Reynolds suspended
him and he confiscated his science project?

07:15.402 --> 07:17.734
Do you have any idea how he did it?

07:18.372 --> 07:22.001
Could have been a trick.
Or it could be meteor-rock inspired.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.077
Or he could be an alien.

07:26.213 --> 07:29.046
- Alien? Why would you say that?
- Rumors from his old school.

07:29.216 --> 07:33.653
He went to junior high in Grandville and told
some kids there he was extraterrestrial.

07:33.821 --> 07:37.689
Needless to say, they sent him
to a distant corner in the social galaxy.

07:39.092 --> 07:42.926
- He didn't do anything super, did he?
- Like start fire with his eyes?

07:43.964 --> 07:49.197
But he did make it a habit of running away.
Last time, cops found him in a field, naked.

07:49.369 --> 07:53.100
Cyrus was pointing to the sky saying,
"They're coming to take me home."

07:53.273 --> 07:56.037
That incident landed him
in the mental institution.

07:56.210 --> 07:58.644
You don't think
he's really an alien, do you?

07:59.413 --> 08:02.940
No. But wouldn't it be awesome
if he was, though?

08:03.450 --> 08:06.942
- Yeah, it'd be the story of the century.
- This isn't about Pulitzers, Clark.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.055
I mean, can you imagine
being from another planet?

08:10.357 --> 08:13.383
The experiences you could share?

08:13.560 --> 08:16.529
- It wouldn't freak you out?
- Oh, compared to most people...

08:16.697 --> 08:18.858
...I think aliens would be a step up.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.154
Cyrus.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.325
What are you doing here, Clark?

08:54.368 --> 08:57.394
I heard about your suspension,
wanted to make sure you were okay.

08:58.171 --> 08:59.570
High school is irrelevant.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.773
Just gives me more time
to concentrate on my work.

09:02.943 --> 09:06.470
- Where's your parents?
- Foster parents. They work late.

09:06.647 --> 09:09.810
They don't bother me
as long as they get their monthly check.

09:10.350 --> 09:13.046
Is this interrogation over?

09:15.489 --> 09:18.049
I heard about the rumor
from your old school.

09:18.759 --> 09:21.193
That I'm an alien.
You've come to see if it's true.

09:21.461 --> 09:23.361
I have an open mind.

09:23.530 --> 09:27.489
If I showed you any of my other
special powers, would that appease you?

09:28.735 --> 09:30.396
Go away, Clark.

09:30.571 --> 09:33.938
You're like all the others.
I won't be ridiculed by your kind anymore.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.837
I'm not here to make fun of you.
Or to get you in trouble.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.205
- Then what do you want?
- The truth.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.074
I promise I won't tell anyone.

09:45.752 --> 09:49.586
I input these coordinates into my
transmitter, send a signal to my planet.

09:49.756 --> 09:53.419
- How do you know they're correct?
- I used to have these weird dreams.

09:53.594 --> 09:57.223
That's when they were given to me.
Afterwards, I'd wake up in strange places.

09:57.898 --> 10:01.231
Frightened my old foster parents.
They had me locked away eventually.

10:01.568 --> 10:04.469
Can't imagine any other race
being as barbaric as humans.

10:04.638 --> 10:08.335
- Why, what'd they do to you?
- Tried to make me believe I was crazy.

10:08.508 --> 10:09.941
That I was really one of you.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.838
Cyrus, I want to believe you.

10:14.481 --> 10:16.506
What kind of proof do you have?

10:16.683 --> 10:20.175
Whatever proof I had was destroyed
the day of the meteor shower.

10:21.221 --> 10:22.984
That's when I arrived on Earth.

10:23.156 --> 10:27.058
An elderly couple found me
on the outskirts of town and raised me.

10:27.227 --> 10:30.594
After they died,
I bounced around between foster parents...

10:30.764 --> 10:33.460
...but I kept trying to get back here.
- Why?

10:33.634 --> 10:36.467
Smallville's ground zero for the signal.

10:36.737 --> 10:39.831
I have to be here
so my real parents can take me home.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.079
Martha?

10:49.850 --> 10:52.045
Martha, you down here...?

11:00.694 --> 11:03.094
Sweetheart, is anything wrong?

11:03.263 --> 11:07.666
I'm just thinking of Clark
traveling millions of miles through space.

11:07.834 --> 11:12.464
How the ship protected him,
and what it did for me.

11:15.976 --> 11:18.774
The ship has given us two miracles.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.810
I hope you're right.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.613
Martha, what is it?

11:29.790 --> 11:33.851
I'm not sure. I'm...
I'm scared.

11:34.027 --> 11:37.827
I'm having these terrible headaches
and mood swings...

11:37.998 --> 11:40.694
...and my sleeping patterns
are all upside-down.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.768
Dr. Baker said
that you're perfectly healthy...

11:43.937 --> 11:46.269
...and that your pregnancy's
absolutely normal.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.670
Except for the way
I was able to conceive.

11:50.143 --> 11:53.340
I want Helen Bryce to examine me,
just to make sure.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.914
- No.
- I trust her.

11:56.083 --> 11:59.348
She's seen Clark's blood. She knows
that something brought me back...

11:59.519 --> 12:02.750
...and she hasn't sent anybody
knocking at our door for answers.

12:02.923 --> 12:06.359
Dr. Helen Bryce is intimately involved
with Lex Luthor.

12:06.526 --> 12:10.189
If you need a second opinion, get it
from any other doctor but Helen Bryce.

12:10.363 --> 12:11.887
Why not?

12:12.232 --> 12:16.293
Because I don't want our family secrets
becoming pillow talk.

12:30.350 --> 12:33.911
I never figured you
for having an identity crisis, Clark.

12:37.357 --> 12:41.657
- It's for a friend.
- Haven't heard that one before.

12:41.828 --> 12:46.595
What's your friend's problem,
Napoleon or messiah complex?

12:46.767 --> 12:48.962
Actually, he thinks he's an alien.

12:49.703 --> 12:51.227
So that proves he isn't.

12:53.774 --> 12:57.210
Clark, if you were really an alien,
would you tell people about it?

12:57.377 --> 12:58.639
Probably not.

13:00.714 --> 13:03.945
Let me guess.
Your friend, he's a little odd.

13:04.351 --> 13:07.013
Spends a lot of time alone,
thinks no one understands him.

13:07.554 --> 13:11.320
I just described myself in high school.
It's a classic outsider profile.

13:11.491 --> 13:14.187
I'd say he's just trying to get attention.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.528
You believe
there are aliens among us, Clark?

13:22.435 --> 13:26.166
- I just want to help him.
- Give me his name. I'll talk to some people.

13:26.406 --> 13:30.433
I promised to keep it private.
He's trying to avoid any more doctors.

13:30.911 --> 13:34.312
By the way, I have to congratulate you.

13:34.481 --> 13:38.417
Offering to board Whitney's horse?
That was a masterful stroke.

13:38.585 --> 13:41.782
I didn't do anything. She needed a place
for her horse and I offered.

13:41.955 --> 13:44.651
So did I. But she turned me down.

13:46.459 --> 13:50.225
Told her she could keep him
in the mansion stables, free of charge.

13:50.764 --> 13:53.824
Guess she was holding out
for the right offer.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.573
Clark.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.319
- Dad, what's going on?
- I don't know, son.

14:14.487 --> 14:17.888
We got Tyson out of the trailer,
Lana was walking him and he collapsed.

14:18.058 --> 14:21.653
She's pretty upset. Why don't
you stay with her, I'll call the vet.

14:31.538 --> 14:35.201
- Not feeling too good?
- I've seen him sick before, but not this bad.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.343
There's help on the way.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.573
I can't lose Tyson too.

14:45.285 --> 14:48.220
He's gonna be fine, Lana, he's a fighter.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.878
Just like his owner.

14:57.530 --> 14:58.861
How could you betray me?

14:59.199 --> 15:02.293
You told that Chloe girl my secret.
She wants to interview me.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.630
- What?
- They'll send me to another shrink.

15:04.804 --> 15:08.535
- They could lock me away again.
- This is not the time nor place for this.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.602
I never should have trusted you.

15:13.113 --> 15:14.603
Clark.

15:19.519 --> 15:22.488
- What's wrong with him?
- We don't know, the vet's on the way.

15:48.048 --> 15:52.747
It's okay. You don't need all these people
poking and prodding you, boy.

15:53.486 --> 15:54.748
I'll make you better.

16:44.304 --> 16:45.566
Hey.

16:45.739 --> 16:47.434
Hey.

16:56.616 --> 17:00.211
- I don't know why you're so skeptical.
- It's hard to believe that that kid...

17:00.387 --> 17:04.221
...could heal a horse by touching it.
It sounds like an old revival-meeting story.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.984
The vet couldn't believe it,
but he said Tyson's healthy.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.958
Cyrus wouldn't be the first
in Smallville with abilities.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.758
Except I don't think he's from Smallville.

17:14.501 --> 17:18.835
Look, this is gonna sound crazy and I didn't
believe it myself at first, but I'm starting to.

17:19.005 --> 17:22.906
I think there's a very strong possibility
that Cyrus is from Krypton.

17:23.943 --> 17:25.843
Why would you think that?

17:26.112 --> 17:29.377
- He said he was.
- He said he was from Krypton?

17:29.616 --> 17:33.712
Well, he didn't use the name,
but I didn't know it until Dr. Swann told me.

17:33.887 --> 17:37.721
But he said he came to Earth during
the meteor shower. And there's more.

17:37.891 --> 17:41.327
Yesterday I saw him start a fire
with heat from his eyes.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.428
What about strength or speed?

17:45.398 --> 17:47.332
- No, but...
- Clark.

17:47.500 --> 17:51.800
Son, we know you want to believe this,
but you don't even have the ability to heal.

17:52.338 --> 17:55.830
That doesn't prove anything.
I didn't get heat vision till last year.

17:56.009 --> 17:57.806
Maybe we'll develop the same abilities.

17:57.977 --> 18:00.969
Or maybe people on Krypton
don't have the same abilities at all.

18:01.147 --> 18:04.207
We don't know for sure,
we've never met anyone else from there.

18:04.384 --> 18:07.285
Dr. Swann said you were
the last survivor of your planet.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.581
What if Dr. Swann is wrong?

18:10.156 --> 18:14.092
Look, don't you see? If I'm right,
this means I'm not alone anymore.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.630
Can I help you, ma'am?

18:58.204 --> 19:02.334
- I was looking for the solarium.
- That's in the south wing. I'll escort you.

19:06.446 --> 19:09.244
You know, Lex gave me this master key.

19:09.415 --> 19:13.317
It's supposed to open every door
in the mansion, but I can't open that one.

19:13.486 --> 19:17.320
That room is strictly off-limits.
The only person with a key is Mr. Luthor.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.720
Shall we?

19:26.399 --> 19:29.163
Hey, Kent, where's your little buddy?

19:29.335 --> 19:32.463
You tell him payback's gonna suck.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.633
- Magic.
- What?

19:34.807 --> 19:36.536
That was how Cyrus started the fire.

19:36.709 --> 19:40.702
The fire marshals found strips of magnesium
powder hidden behind the blackboard.

19:40.880 --> 19:44.338
All Cyrus had to do was wait
for the right moment, hit the detonator...

19:44.517 --> 19:48.715
...and before you can say "presto,"
instant inferno.

19:52.091 --> 19:56.892
- I didn't see him use a detonator.
- But illusion is the art of misdirection, Clark.

19:57.297 --> 20:02.098
Trust me, this kid is more David Blaine
than he is Wall of Weird.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.733
Well, that still doesn't explain
how he cured Tyson.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.900
Yeah, I haven't figured that one out yet.

20:10.076 --> 20:12.510
But I'd bet that he faked
that one too somehow.

20:12.679 --> 20:16.615
- No, I was there. It was real.
- Well, I'm not discounting the possibility...

20:16.783 --> 20:19.115
...that he may have
some magic healing power.

20:19.285 --> 20:22.550
But if he does, it's probably
a byproduct of meteorite poisoning.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.551
He is no more extraterrestrial than you are.

20:30.763 --> 20:33.823
When I saw your name on the chart,
I thought there was a mistake.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.458
I haven't had a new patient
since the Inquisitor hit the stands.

20:37.637 --> 20:40.731
People can be small-minded.
I hope things work out for you.

20:40.907 --> 20:43.273
Thank you, Mrs. Kent.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.436
So...

20:48.181 --> 20:50.877
According to the charts your OB sent over...

20:51.050 --> 20:53.644
...your pregnancy's
been smooth sailing so far.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.720
I don't know about that.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.915
Whatever we talk about
is confidential, right?

21:00.093 --> 21:02.357
- Of course.
- You won't tell anyone?

21:02.528 --> 21:05.497
Not even significant others?

21:06.099 --> 21:10.331
- You're worried I'll tell Lex?
- Jonathan. He doesn't know I'm here.

21:10.970 --> 21:15.430
I can assure you, everything in this office
stays between you and me.

21:18.044 --> 21:22.504
Mrs. Kent, does this have anything
to do with Clark's unusual blood work...

21:22.682 --> 21:25.776
...or your miraculous recovery?
Because I'll be honest with you.

21:25.952 --> 21:28.750
I still don't understand
what I saw that day.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.085
Martha...

21:32.258 --> 21:36.922
...if you really want me to help,
you've gotta be completely honest with me.

21:39.032 --> 21:43.435
For your safety. And the baby's.

21:48.274 --> 21:50.071
Cyrus.

21:51.411 --> 21:52.742
Lex?

21:53.246 --> 21:57.546
- What are you doing here?
- I've always wanted to meet an alien.

21:58.618 --> 22:01.587
When I heard what happened
with Lana's horse...

22:01.754 --> 22:04.814
...I realized this Cyrus
must be the friend you mentioned.

22:06.459 --> 22:09.451
- You said he was fantasizing.
- After what we found in the cave...

22:09.629 --> 22:12.427
...I try and keep an open mind.

22:12.598 --> 22:14.429
Take a look at this.

22:16.369 --> 22:18.894
See, I've always had a theory
that the meteor shower...

22:19.072 --> 22:22.769
...would have been a perfect cover
for an alien spacecraft to land on Earth.

22:24.243 --> 22:27.679
Anyway, looks like we both wasted a trip.
You want a ride?

22:27.847 --> 22:29.314
No, I think I'll stay and wait.

22:29.482 --> 22:32.246
Tell your friend I'd like to buy him
a latte sometime.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.249
See you later, Clark.

22:43.396 --> 22:45.557
I don't trust your friend.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.225
I know you faked the fire, Cyrus.

22:49.435 --> 22:50.925
I don't deny it.

22:51.104 --> 22:53.937
Kyle and his intelligence-challenged
comrades...

22:54.107 --> 22:57.440
...have harassed me since I got here.
- Why didn't you use your powers?

22:57.610 --> 23:02.104
- I only have the power to heal, not to harm.
- You still claim that you cured that horse?

23:02.382 --> 23:04.680
Believe whatever you want.

23:08.554 --> 23:10.385
Did you draw these?

23:13.393 --> 23:15.054
That's how I got to Earth.

23:15.495 --> 23:17.486
Where's the spaceship?

23:17.663 --> 23:18.960
I don't know.

23:22.435 --> 23:23.800
But you remember coming here.

23:24.537 --> 23:27.563
Remember those dreams
I told you about?

23:28.074 --> 23:29.905
I dream about my parents too.

23:30.810 --> 23:33.438
And what it'll be like the day I go home.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.142
I believe you, Cyrus.

23:41.487 --> 23:43.182
You do?

23:46.626 --> 23:50.255
That makes you the first person
who doesn't think I'm crazy.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.904
Wow, you built this?

24:02.074 --> 24:03.837
What is it?

24:04.010 --> 24:06.410
My transmission tower.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.012
How does it work?

24:08.181 --> 24:11.412
At the appointed time, I'll send a signal
and my parents will come.

24:11.584 --> 24:16.351
They'll transport me up to their ship,
and then they'll take me home.

24:16.522 --> 24:20.754
I can see how this would be a little difficult
to explain to a group of psychiatrists.

24:20.927 --> 24:23.760
I wish that were my only problem.

24:23.963 --> 24:27.126
I'm supposed to send a signal
at midnight tomorrow...

24:27.300 --> 24:29.996
...but I don't have my transmitter.

24:30.169 --> 24:33.502
After the incident in the electronics lab,
Reynolds confiscated it.

24:34.574 --> 24:37.008
- Can't you build another one?
- There isn't time.

24:37.176 --> 24:40.873
The conditions necessary for my departure
only occur once every 200 years.

24:41.581 --> 24:46.280
If I don't get that transmitter back,
I'll never get home.

24:47.119 --> 24:50.020
Please. Help me.

25:29.529 --> 25:30.791
What are you losers doing?

25:30.963 --> 25:33.761
If I were you, I'd get back in my truck
and go home. Now!

25:33.933 --> 25:37.391
- Take it easy, Cyrus.
- If you don't leave us alone, you'll regret it.

25:37.570 --> 25:41.233
Save it, reject. We know how you
faked that fire to make us look like morons.

25:41.407 --> 25:43.898
They're all laughing at us,
so we'll kick your ass.

25:44.076 --> 25:45.703
Yeah, that's right.

25:45.878 --> 25:49.837
This time you didn't have a chance to
set up one of your little tricks, did you?

25:50.016 --> 25:52.416
I'm warning you, Kyle. Leave me alone.

25:59.125 --> 26:00.990
- My truck!
- What's going on?

26:05.298 --> 26:06.731
Come on, let's get out of here!

26:07.266 --> 26:09.826
I warned you, now leave!

26:17.276 --> 26:20.939
- Way to go, Cyrus, you did it.
- No, I didn't, Clark.

26:21.113 --> 26:23.445
- You did.
- That's crazy.

26:23.616 --> 26:26.585
Now I know why you've been helping me,
why you believe me.

26:26.752 --> 26:29.186
Cyrus, I don't know
what you're talking about.

26:30.456 --> 26:32.321
You're an alien too.

26:50.810 --> 26:53.836
I can't believe Cyrus knows your secret.

26:54.013 --> 26:56.447
What was I supposed to do, Pete?
Beat up those guys?

26:56.616 --> 26:59.346
Grab Cyrus and run away
at 1000 miles an hour?

26:59.519 --> 27:01.282
I didn't have much of a choice.

27:01.454 --> 27:04.753
- Well, have you told your parents yet?
- No.

27:04.924 --> 27:07.552
- They'd just freak out.
- And they'd have a right to.

27:07.727 --> 27:10.787
I mean, how long until
Cyrus tells somebody?

27:11.064 --> 27:12.964
It's not like he's exactly stable.

27:15.668 --> 27:18.398
- He's not gonna tell anyone.
- Clark, how do you know that?

27:18.571 --> 27:21.734
Look at this.
The coordinates that Cyrus gave me...

27:21.908 --> 27:25.344
...are for the same solar system
as Krypton.

27:26.146 --> 27:29.980
Clark, dozens of astronomers
have written about the meteor showers.

27:30.150 --> 27:33.779
- He could have used their research.
- First the drawings of the ship, now this?

27:33.953 --> 27:38.049
It's too much of a coincidence. Maybe my
parents weren't alone in saving their child.

27:38.224 --> 27:41.057
If you wanna know,
I could take him a piece of meteor rock.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.827
- No, it's called Kryptonite.
- Kryptonite.

27:43.997 --> 27:47.262
- Is that with a C or a K?
- Clark, are you up there?

27:47.433 --> 27:48.730
K.

27:50.003 --> 27:52.904
Cyrus was at the Talon
when Child Protective Services took him.

27:53.072 --> 27:55.836
- What?
- His foster parents couldn't handle him...

27:56.009 --> 28:00.912
...so they're sending him to the
Smallville Medical Center for assessment.

28:14.827 --> 28:16.658
Clark.

28:18.831 --> 28:21.493
I don't want to be locked up again.

28:21.668 --> 28:23.795
You don't know what it's like.

28:23.970 --> 28:27.997
- The doctors. The tests.
- What can I do?

28:29.409 --> 28:32.674
If I'm not on that tower at midnight...

28:32.946 --> 28:35.779
...I'm gonna be stranded
on this world forever.

28:48.661 --> 28:50.891
You gotta get out of here.

28:54.067 --> 28:55.864
Clark.

28:57.237 --> 28:59.797
- Come with me.
- What are you talking about?

28:59.973 --> 29:02.464
You're not meant for this Earth
any more than I am.

29:02.642 --> 29:04.837
I'll take you back to your real home.

29:08.381 --> 29:10.645
This is my real home.

29:10.817 --> 29:13.081
Everything I care about is on Earth.

29:18.057 --> 29:19.456
Good luck, Cyrus.

29:19.792 --> 29:22.317
You give me hope for this world, Clark.

29:22.495 --> 29:24.895
I wish there were more people
like you here.

29:31.871 --> 29:33.463
I'll send you a postcard.

29:38.544 --> 29:41.980
Lex, we need to have a talk.

29:42.148 --> 29:45.083
Is this a closet-space issue?

29:45.351 --> 29:47.819
Because I could use
the walk-in across the hall.

29:48.688 --> 29:53.022
When you asked me to move in, you gave
me a key to open every door in the house.

29:53.192 --> 29:55.057
All except one.

29:55.895 --> 29:58.955
- You've been exploring.
- At first I thought I could deal with it...

29:59.132 --> 30:02.932
...but then the more I think about it,
the more it starts to bother me.

30:03.102 --> 30:05.093
There's nothing of consequence
in that room.

30:05.271 --> 30:08.729
- Then why is it locked?
- Look...

30:08.908 --> 30:11.900
...everyone needs a place
where they can be alone.

30:12.078 --> 30:15.741
Hear their own thoughts.
That's all that room is for me.

30:16.282 --> 30:20.343
You are welcome to make your own space
anywhere else in the mansion.

30:20.520 --> 30:23.978
I wasn't looking for a roommate.
I want someone to share my life with.

30:24.157 --> 30:27.593
You know, you need to figure out
what kind of a relationship you want.

30:27.760 --> 30:31.787
Because if this is gonna work,
there can't be any locked doors between us.

30:42.241 --> 30:45.404
Hey, Clark.
Cyrus escaped from the medical center.

30:45.578 --> 30:49.514
The Child Protective Services and the sheriff
are searching for him everywhere.

30:49.682 --> 30:51.343
Take a look at this.

30:52.985 --> 30:55.215
- Who are these people?
- John and Maggie Burnet...

30:55.388 --> 30:58.824
...and their son, William. They disappeared
the day of the meteor shower.

30:58.991 --> 31:02.552
Rescue workers suspected they were
vaporized when their farmhouse was hit.

31:02.862 --> 31:05.422
- But no remains were ever found.
- If the son survived...

31:05.598 --> 31:07.566
...he'd be too young to remember.

31:07.734 --> 31:09.793
The older couple that adopted Cyrus...

31:09.969 --> 31:13.029
...lived half a mile away
from the Burnet house.

31:13.206 --> 31:16.664
- What are you saying?
- What we're saying is, Cyrus is not an alien.

31:16.843 --> 31:18.708
He's an orphan.

32:02.155 --> 32:03.850
- Let him know.
- Yeah, man! Come on!

32:05.058 --> 32:07.754
- Take it down, baby!
- Where you going, firestarter?

32:09.028 --> 32:12.225
You'd better get off there,
because this thing is coming down!

32:12.398 --> 32:15.265
What are you gonna do, fly away?

32:15.635 --> 32:18.968
Let's teach this freak a lesson
he won't forget.

32:19.873 --> 32:21.306
Come on, space boy!

32:24.210 --> 32:27.839
- Yeah, Kyle, take it down!
- Come on, buddy!

32:35.121 --> 32:36.452
Down! Bring him down!

32:49.769 --> 32:51.031
No! Stop!

32:51.304 --> 32:53.295
You can't do this!

32:53.740 --> 32:55.207
Stop!

33:03.049 --> 33:05.711
No! Not now!
You'll ruin everything!

33:07.253 --> 33:08.618
Do it!

33:17.230 --> 33:18.492
No!

33:19.732 --> 33:21.529
Faster! Come on!

33:21.701 --> 33:23.601
Stop, please! No!

33:44.457 --> 33:47.017
Go! Go! Go!

33:53.800 --> 33:55.791
I gotta get up there.
My parents are coming.

33:55.969 --> 33:58.563
Your parents died.
In the meteor shower.

33:58.738 --> 34:00.729
That's ridiculous,
my parents aren't human.

34:01.040 --> 34:03.133
Hey, I think his neck's broken.

34:03.409 --> 34:05.309
Cyrus, you can save him.

34:05.478 --> 34:09.244
They're here. I can't,
I'll be stranded on this world forever.

34:09.415 --> 34:12.179
- You have the power to heal.
- Why do you care about them?

34:12.351 --> 34:15.981
Cyrus, don't let him die.
We both know you're better than that.

34:16.155 --> 34:17.952
Come on!

34:56.161 --> 35:00.622
I missed it. I missed it.

35:01.567 --> 35:03.194
Cyrus.

35:05.705 --> 35:07.366
Cyrus.

35:11.544 --> 35:13.705
This is the Kansas State Police.

35:13.880 --> 35:16.815
If you require assistance,
please stay where you are.

35:16.983 --> 35:21.750
Emergency vehicles have been dispatched
and will arrive shortly.

35:49.482 --> 35:51.211
Clark.

35:52.518 --> 35:54.418
Clark!

36:21.748 --> 36:26.378
The doctors say that Cyrus
had a complete mental breakdown.

36:27.487 --> 36:30.513
His body's there but his mind is gone.

36:34.060 --> 36:36.620
They don't know if he'll recover.

36:40.900 --> 36:44.631
They transferred him
to a special hospital in Metropolis.

36:46.639 --> 36:48.504
Son...

36:49.008 --> 36:51.772
...how do you think Cyrus
was able to draw your ship?

36:53.446 --> 36:56.006
His house was near
where you guys found me.

36:56.182 --> 36:59.743
My guess, he was outside
and saw the ship land.

37:01.187 --> 37:04.714
Memories stayed with him and over time
he thought that past was his own.

37:04.891 --> 37:06.756
We know how much
you wanted to believe...

37:06.926 --> 37:10.089
...that there could be somebody else
out there like you.

37:17.236 --> 37:18.703
What is it, Clark?

37:21.674 --> 37:26.839
Why would Cyrus pass up what he believed
was his only opportunity to go home...

37:27.447 --> 37:31.884
...to save Kyle, the school bully?

37:32.251 --> 37:35.379
Because he was a lot more like you
than we ever thought.

38:00.613 --> 38:02.672
What is all this?

38:03.983 --> 38:06.816
Montaigne said...

38:07.787 --> 38:11.621
...obsession was the wellspring
of genius and madness.

38:12.758 --> 38:14.658
This is my obsession.

38:16.596 --> 38:20.498
I'm sure you can understand
my reluctance to show you this room.

38:21.067 --> 38:26.095
I thought you might decide
I was a little eccentric.

39:11.918 --> 39:14.443
There's a lot here about the Kents.

39:17.056 --> 39:18.546
Yeah.

39:21.994 --> 39:24.827
They're an interesting family.

39:24.997 --> 39:26.988
Don't you think?

40:03.769 --> 40:05.134
Hey.

40:08.874 --> 40:11.775
Whatever Cyrus did to Tyson
wasn't temporary.

40:12.178 --> 40:15.113
It's like he's a colt again.

40:16.048 --> 40:18.539
Well, I'm glad some good
came out of all this.

40:18.718 --> 40:20.982
Yeah, Cyrus seemed really Ionely.

40:25.891 --> 40:29.019
Lana, what if Cyrus really
could have proven he was an alien?

40:31.063 --> 40:32.655
What do you mean?

40:33.499 --> 40:38.664
I mean, how would you feel about him
if he actually was from another planet?

40:40.773 --> 40:42.570
Well...

40:43.542 --> 40:45.373
I guess I'd try and keep an open mind.

40:47.079 --> 40:50.310
You'd never feel completely comfortable
with him, would you?

40:50.883 --> 40:54.182
Have to admit, I'd be a little freaked out.

40:58.391 --> 41:00.985
Does that make me a bad person?

41:02.561 --> 41:05.291
No. Just honest.

41:09.301 --> 41:11.098
Clark, look.

41:12.738 --> 41:14.535
Think it's a spaceship?

41:19.211 --> 41:20.735
It's just a shooting star.

41:21.305 --> 41:27.432
