WEBVTT

00:00.313 --> 00:02.055
Previously on "The Arrangement"...

00:02.086 --> 00:03.695
Have you looked at the
language in this contract?

00:03.719 --> 00:06.520
He's expecting you to be,
like, the perfect girlfriend.

00:06.522 --> 00:09.690
And we both know you
haven't been perfect.

00:09.692 --> 00:11.391
Kyle West is really just a product

00:11.393 --> 00:13.660
of the Institute of the Higher Mind,

00:13.662 --> 00:16.430
which I've also heard
terrible stories about.

00:16.432 --> 00:18.298
It's about my stepbrother.

00:18.300 --> 00:20.934
He used to come in my bedroom at night.

00:20.936 --> 00:22.418
People are going to start to wonder:

00:22.443 --> 00:25.172
Did Kyle West's fiancÃ© really
smash her stepbrother's head in?

00:25.174 --> 00:27.774
He was killed about six years ago,

00:27.799 --> 00:29.432
and some guy went to jail for it.

00:29.457 --> 00:30.677
What's he want?

00:30.679 --> 00:32.579
What makes you think Terence
is going to listen to you?

00:32.581 --> 00:35.682
Because... I'm working for him now.

00:35.684 --> 00:37.184
Wait, you're what?

00:37.186 --> 00:40.120
Do you or do you not

00:40.122 --> 00:42.022
want to be at the
center of your own story?

00:42.024 --> 00:43.957
We have a huge problem,
and now the reputations

00:43.959 --> 00:46.426
of both Kyle and the
Institute are at serious risk.

00:46.428 --> 00:48.338
Sometimes the ones
who are most resistant

00:48.363 --> 00:50.230
end up with the biggest breakthroughs.

00:50.232 --> 00:52.366
Kyle and I are gonna be good again.

00:52.368 --> 00:54.501
Megan, everything's gonna be okay.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:16.825 --> 01:18.458
You're awake.

01:19.828 --> 01:22.195
Good, we can get started.

01:24.566 --> 01:27.668
You're holding me against my will.

01:27.670 --> 01:29.976
I'm not drinking the coffee.

01:30.953 --> 01:32.439
Suit yourself.

01:32.441 --> 01:34.574
Personally, I use a second cup.

01:38.447 --> 01:40.763
Most mornings will
start about this time.

01:40.788 --> 01:42.682
Initially, it'll be you and me,

01:42.685 --> 01:45.779
and then as we make progress,
things will diversify.

01:47.115 --> 01:50.457
This can be a great
experience for you, Megan.

01:50.459 --> 01:53.393
You'll be well fed,
practice a healthy lifestyle,

01:53.395 --> 01:55.329
but most of all, you have the chance

01:55.331 --> 01:57.394
to truly transform your life.

01:57.419 --> 02:00.567
You make this sound
like some kind of spa.

02:00.569 --> 02:03.287
None of these people
are allowed to leave.

02:03.312 --> 02:07.006
I know this may be hard for
you to believe right now, but...

02:07.009 --> 02:09.342
most of them don't want to.

02:09.392 --> 02:10.955
When we say, "believe"...

02:10.979 --> 02:13.515
we're talking about
faith in our own visions.

02:13.555 --> 02:16.743
We're giving ourselves over
to who we know we can be.

02:16.768 --> 02:19.463
And we recommit to that every day.

02:20.344 --> 02:22.698
The process will start
with you and me talking.

02:22.723 --> 02:24.097
We'll go at your speed.

02:24.122 --> 02:27.427
I want you to feel as
comfortable as possible.

02:27.429 --> 02:31.064
Of course. Terence wants
a videotaped confession.

02:31.066 --> 02:32.532
This isn't for Terence.

02:32.534 --> 02:34.584
Trust me, this is for you.

02:35.537 --> 02:38.358
- I'm not buying it.
- I know.

02:38.383 --> 02:41.358
Next week, you and me are going
to watch this session together.

02:41.383 --> 02:43.457
It's gonna blow your mind.

02:46.749 --> 02:48.715
You have a file on me?

02:48.717 --> 02:51.231
Notes, public records,

02:51.256 --> 02:53.520
a lot of social media.

02:53.522 --> 02:58.325
You present yourself to the
world as this happy person.

02:58.327 --> 03:01.025
Are you a happy person?

03:01.563 --> 03:03.627
I am a happy person.

03:04.199 --> 03:05.713
I was.

03:06.322 --> 03:09.403
Do you really believe that what
you've been experiencing is happiness,

03:09.405 --> 03:12.533
considering the secret
you've been living with?

03:13.409 --> 03:15.604
I'm doing my best...

03:17.012 --> 03:19.179
and everyone lives with regret.

03:19.181 --> 03:21.882
Megan, not everyone takes
another person's life

03:21.884 --> 03:23.984
and then simply walks away.

03:27.953 --> 03:30.061
It wasn't simple.

03:31.160 --> 03:33.160
I was young.

03:33.558 --> 03:35.958
I was defending myself.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.331
And I didn't think that
anyone would believe me.

03:38.333 --> 03:39.933
You were young then,

03:39.935 --> 03:41.835
but you went on to sign a contract

03:41.837 --> 03:44.242
to be in a relationship
with a major celebrity.

03:44.773 --> 03:46.840
Despite your past, you made the choice

03:46.842 --> 03:48.775
to put yourself in the public eye.

03:48.777 --> 03:51.695
Two different kinds of people
would do something like that.

03:52.080 --> 03:55.526
A con artist, or someone who
is seriously lying to herself

03:55.551 --> 03:57.317
about who she is.

03:57.319 --> 03:58.885
So I don't know who I am,

03:58.887 --> 04:02.312
but you do because you
looked at my Instagram page?

04:03.570 --> 04:05.725
You getting off on this, Terence?

04:10.462 --> 04:11.771
How's she doing?

04:11.796 --> 04:13.329
She's really embracing the process.

04:13.354 --> 04:14.724
Well, it takes time.

04:14.749 --> 04:17.103
Have we taken care of our
public relations problem?

04:17.105 --> 04:19.105
Colton? I'm handling it.

04:19.107 --> 04:20.774
How exactly?

04:20.776 --> 04:23.523
You never wanted to hear details
about things like this before.

04:23.548 --> 04:25.645
I set Megan up so you could kidnap her.

04:25.647 --> 04:28.114
I want to make sure
this whole thing works.

04:28.116 --> 04:29.716
Are you worried it won't?

04:29.718 --> 04:32.185
This isn't some football
player with a DUI.

04:32.187 --> 04:34.753
This could be a major
problem for all of us.

04:34.778 --> 04:36.990
And I can be an asset.

04:52.140 --> 04:53.738
Megan?

04:54.500 --> 04:56.058
Megan,

04:56.545 --> 04:58.886
I want you to see something.

05:00.949 --> 05:03.083
This is your narrative board.

05:03.085 --> 05:04.751
It has two sides.

05:04.776 --> 05:07.824
And as we talk, we're going to
identify the lies you tell yourself,

05:07.849 --> 05:09.923
and you're gonna write them
on this side of the board.

05:09.925 --> 05:11.858
And each time we do that,
we're gonna replace it

05:11.860 --> 05:14.127
with a truth on this side of the board.

05:14.129 --> 05:16.997
Those aren't always easy to come by,

05:16.999 --> 05:19.762
but this how we're gonna
build your new narrative.

05:21.570 --> 05:23.215
Okay.

05:29.645 --> 05:31.811
Lies go here?

05:51.500 --> 05:53.433
All right, I get it.

05:55.045 --> 05:57.294
You don't want to do this with me.

05:57.319 --> 06:01.028
Would you feel more comfortable
if it were Kyle instead?

06:02.711 --> 06:04.294
Okay.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.935
Kyle, why don't you
come in here, please?

06:35.251 --> 06:36.946
You're an asshole.

06:38.180 --> 06:40.056
I've been doing this a long time,

06:40.081 --> 06:43.961
and I've learned that resistance
is usually connected to hope,

06:43.986 --> 06:45.585
so let me be clear.

06:45.587 --> 06:47.566
Nobody is coming for you,

06:48.214 --> 06:50.557
and you are not leaving here
until we undo this narrative

06:50.559 --> 06:52.559
that is destroying your life.

06:54.197 --> 06:57.199
So you let me know when
you're ready to get to work.

07:18.681 --> 07:21.682
Sorry, I didn't mean
to interrupt your...

07:21.684 --> 07:23.337
Affirmations.

07:23.837 --> 07:26.751
- Do you mind if I sit?
- Please.

07:30.439 --> 07:32.285
You're new here.

07:32.310 --> 07:34.777
- I'm Anthony.
- Megan.

07:35.982 --> 07:37.315
So...

07:37.317 --> 07:39.250
how are you holding up?

07:39.252 --> 07:40.852
Great.

07:40.854 --> 07:42.720
They kidnapped me, threw me in a van,

07:42.722 --> 07:45.216
and now they want me to bare my soul.

07:45.241 --> 07:47.425
Yeah.

07:47.427 --> 07:50.061
The beginning is a little tough.

07:50.063 --> 07:51.462
Yeah.

07:55.944 --> 07:57.877
So how did you get here?

07:57.902 --> 08:00.338
Come on.

08:00.340 --> 08:03.965
How to get out is what
you're really interested in.

08:04.387 --> 08:06.102
Yes.

08:06.127 --> 08:07.768
Good.

08:07.793 --> 08:09.881
You two have met.

08:09.883 --> 08:12.517
Nobody's more committed to
the process than Anthony.

08:12.519 --> 08:15.113
He's going home next week.

08:15.138 --> 08:16.731
And that's when the work really starts.

08:16.756 --> 08:19.990
- At least I have the tools now.
- You're gonna be great.

08:20.015 --> 08:23.228
So, Megan, I thought it might
be helpful for you and me

08:23.230 --> 08:25.096
to take the afternoon off.

08:25.098 --> 08:27.999
I want to give you a chance to
do some exploration on your own.

08:28.001 --> 08:30.101
I want you to find a quiet place
where you can put your thoughts

08:30.103 --> 08:32.370
on paper, whatever they are.

08:32.371 --> 08:34.038
How does that sound?

08:40.080 --> 08:43.000
Okay. I'll check in with you later.

08:51.658 --> 08:53.633
You want to get out of here?

08:54.594 --> 08:56.294
Do your work.

08:56.296 --> 08:59.664
It's helped me get me out of my own way,

08:59.666 --> 09:01.599
and plus, if you don't,

09:01.601 --> 09:04.369
things get a little less pleasant.

09:04.371 --> 09:06.404
I learned that early on.

09:06.406 --> 09:08.306
Well, how long have you been here?

09:08.308 --> 09:10.375
Eight months.

09:10.705 --> 09:12.037
I think.

09:12.062 --> 09:14.730
It's easy to lose track.

09:19.744 --> 09:21.813
He's three minutes late.

09:22.289 --> 09:24.389
Maybe after we pay off the extortionist,

09:24.391 --> 09:26.824
we can have ourselves a piece of pie.

09:26.826 --> 09:28.760
We'll see how much
money we have left over.

09:32.532 --> 09:33.798
Heads up.

09:37.460 --> 09:39.599
You're not the movie star.

09:40.507 --> 09:42.168
Have a seat.

09:45.808 --> 09:48.446
My name's Terence, and this
is my lovely wife, DeAnn.

09:48.448 --> 09:49.986
I recognize you.

09:50.011 --> 09:51.881
You're the... guru.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.421
Okay, what do we have here?

09:58.860 --> 10:01.496
I'm gonna tell you how
this is gonna work first.

10:03.493 --> 10:05.961
You're not getting $5 million today.

10:06.044 --> 10:08.032
There's a hundred grand in the bag.

10:08.034 --> 10:10.863
In 60 days from now,
if you've kept quiet,

10:10.888 --> 10:12.437
there'll be another 100 thousand,

10:12.439 --> 10:14.706
and every 60 days after that.

10:14.708 --> 10:18.976
And in five years from
now, if... things go well,

10:18.978 --> 10:21.138
you'll have $3 million.

10:22.582 --> 10:25.516
I lost six years of my
life because of that bitch.

10:25.518 --> 10:28.058
I'm not gonna let myself
be dicked over by anybody.

10:28.083 --> 10:29.573
I get paid what I wanna get paid.

10:29.598 --> 10:31.556
None of this low-ball bullshit.

10:31.558 --> 10:33.159
Jesus Christ, Terence,

10:33.184 --> 10:35.045
- this was not the way to handle this.
- DeAnn...

10:35.069 --> 10:37.036
Listen, why don't we just
eliminate the problem?

10:37.061 --> 10:38.463
Would you just slow down for a second?

10:38.465 --> 10:40.298
Why? We're clearly wasting our time.

10:40.300 --> 10:41.599
What are you, threatening me?

10:41.601 --> 10:43.601
I wanna make sure
things don't get messy.

10:43.603 --> 10:45.636
It's too late for that.

10:48.341 --> 10:50.156
This isn't right.

10:50.181 --> 10:53.211
Hey, wait. This isn't the way it works.

10:53.213 --> 10:55.179
Stop talking.

10:55.181 --> 10:57.308
You don't get to have a say anymore.

10:57.333 --> 10:59.984
I have spent a lifetime
building what I have,

10:59.986 --> 11:02.620
and I'm not gonna let you
or anyone else destroy it.

11:02.622 --> 11:06.090
- You can't tell me...
- I will put you in the ground.

11:07.091 --> 11:08.960
So here's what's gonna happen.

11:09.528 --> 11:13.114
You're gonna take the
$100,000 and go away.

11:13.591 --> 11:15.233
That is all you get.

11:15.235 --> 11:16.941
And you should count your blessings,

11:16.966 --> 11:18.436
because you have messed with forces

11:18.438 --> 11:21.089
larger than you can possibly comprehend.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.341
Our organization is everywhere.

11:23.343 --> 11:26.894
If we see you, if we
hear one word from you,

11:26.919 --> 11:28.579
I promise you...

11:28.581 --> 11:31.282
there will be nowhere for you to run.

11:34.060 --> 11:35.819
Go.

11:35.844 --> 11:38.222
If you're lucky, you'll
make it to your car.

11:48.813 --> 11:51.422
- Shall we have that pie?
- Sure.

12:25.972 --> 12:28.239
No! Don't touch me! Don't...

12:28.241 --> 12:29.885
Get away from me!

12:29.910 --> 12:31.963
No! No!

12:31.988 --> 12:33.511
You can't do this to me!

12:33.513 --> 12:34.879
Aah!

13:04.488 --> 13:07.178
These all-nighters are
starting to take their toll.

13:07.180 --> 13:10.014
I hear you. I've got four days
of reflection time coming up,

13:10.016 --> 13:12.410
and all I'm gonna do is sleep.

13:18.254 --> 13:20.221
- Something wrong?
- No, I just wanna grab

13:20.223 --> 13:22.830
a bottle of water for the ride.

13:25.565 --> 13:27.365
Well, you drive safe now.

13:27.367 --> 13:29.667
Hey, thanks. It's
always good to see you.

13:31.271 --> 13:32.570
Let me know next time you're coming up.

13:32.572 --> 13:34.238
We'll go grab some breakfast.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.786
_

15:40.315 --> 15:42.963
Yeah, we need the retention
crew on the west end.

15:42.988 --> 15:44.988
Right, I'm on it.

16:30.547 --> 16:32.151
Hello?

16:32.176 --> 16:34.926
Is anyone there, please? I need help!

16:36.967 --> 16:39.182
My goodness!

16:39.207 --> 16:41.778
Please, I need to get out of sight.

16:42.567 --> 16:43.709
Please.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.944
Come in, then, quickly.

16:45.946 --> 16:49.831
My God! You are chilled to the bone.

16:49.857 --> 16:52.388
What happened to you?

16:54.955 --> 16:56.637
Sit.

16:59.760 --> 17:01.567
I need help.

17:02.262 --> 17:05.351
- Can you drive me somewhere?
- Of course...

17:05.376 --> 17:08.133
but where do you want to go?

17:08.135 --> 17:10.068
I don't know. I-I have to think.

17:10.069 --> 17:12.568
Well, you... you sit there and think.

17:12.593 --> 17:14.339
I'm going to get you some tea.

17:14.340 --> 17:16.474
And some breakfast.

17:16.477 --> 17:18.970
Scrambled eggs okay?

17:18.994 --> 17:20.913
Yeah, thanks.

17:53.743 --> 17:55.821
Hey, Megan. Jesus Christ.

17:55.846 --> 17:57.141
Kyle!

17:57.166 --> 17:59.305
Hey, look, I'm here.
Everything's okay, you're safe.

17:59.330 --> 18:00.992
- We have to get out of here.
- No, no, no, listen.

18:01.016 --> 18:04.056
- Breathe, okay? Just...
- Okay. No, Kyle, you don't understand.

18:04.081 --> 18:06.125
- No! Kyle! No!
- Listen. Hey!

18:06.181 --> 18:08.694
- Stay with me. It's okay, Megan.
- No. No!

18:08.696 --> 18:10.421
- No, no, no!
- Just breathe.

18:10.446 --> 18:11.830
No, Kyle, please, no!

18:11.832 --> 18:13.465
Hey, it's okay.

18:13.467 --> 18:15.094
- You knew about this?
- I had no choice.

18:15.119 --> 18:16.392
- You knew about this?
- It's the only way

18:16.416 --> 18:18.516
- for us to be together.
- No!

18:18.672 --> 18:20.219
Hey...

18:21.485 --> 18:22.803
I love you.

18:32.119 --> 18:34.252
No, don't... I'll do it.

18:47.234 --> 18:49.007
- I'm going there with you.
- Kyle...

18:49.032 --> 18:50.602
She looks half dead, Terence!

18:50.604 --> 18:52.711
She looks like she's been running
through the woods all night...

18:52.735 --> 18:54.072
You looked worse when
you went through it.

18:54.074 --> 18:55.941
Yeah, well, I wanted
to grind myself down.

18:55.943 --> 18:57.743
Because you believed in the process,

18:57.745 --> 18:59.077
and it transformed you.

18:59.079 --> 19:01.647
The world opened up for you after that.

19:01.649 --> 19:04.116
You've gotta believe it's
gonna do the same thing for her.

19:04.118 --> 19:06.785
Otherwise, if you don't, we
should just pull the plug.

19:08.322 --> 19:10.522
Look, I believe in the process.

19:10.524 --> 19:14.192
It just... it kills me
to see her like this.

19:14.194 --> 19:15.628
I know.

19:15.653 --> 19:17.796
I know, and that's why
you need to go back to L.A.

19:17.798 --> 19:19.598
Look, you know how this works.

19:19.600 --> 19:22.848
It's gonna take time, but she
will come out the other side.

19:23.348 --> 19:26.567
And you and I have decided
to trust each other again.

19:27.107 --> 19:28.774
So trust me on this one.

19:28.776 --> 19:30.842
Go live your life.

19:44.077 --> 19:45.725
Hello, Megan.

19:50.414 --> 19:52.604
Don't be afraid. I'm not gonna hurt you.

19:55.965 --> 19:57.920
I'm not the enemy.

19:59.178 --> 20:02.443
What you've been fighting so
hard against for so long is you.

20:04.787 --> 20:06.967
You buried your true self.

20:07.725 --> 20:09.622
All we're trying to
do is help you dig down

20:09.647 --> 20:11.155
to find it again.

20:11.180 --> 20:13.113
Why?

20:13.115 --> 20:15.249
You already know the truth.

20:16.678 --> 20:18.385
We know what you've done.

20:18.387 --> 20:20.320
That you killed someone,
that you let an innocent man

20:20.322 --> 20:22.189
take the blame, go to prison.

20:22.191 --> 20:24.391
That you lied and put
a lot of people at risk

20:24.393 --> 20:26.527
to conceal all of it.

20:26.529 --> 20:29.451
But what we don't know,
including yourself, I believe,

20:30.166 --> 20:33.225
is why you thought those
choices were acceptable.

20:34.514 --> 20:36.998
And whatever the answer is,

20:37.673 --> 20:40.040
that's what you're truly afraid of.

20:45.910 --> 20:48.544
This'll help open your mind.

20:50.419 --> 20:52.386
It's not magic.

20:52.388 --> 20:54.188
You're only going to find the truth

20:54.190 --> 20:55.898
if you're willing to look.

20:56.539 --> 20:59.306
And that's the choice you have to make.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.872
Megan, this is your life.

21:04.897 --> 21:07.568
Do you really want to live
the rest of it in fear?

21:49.158 --> 21:51.011
It'll be half an hour
before the REM state

21:51.013 --> 21:52.931
is fully suppressed.

21:54.416 --> 21:57.351
You need to stop seeing
me as a last resort.

22:13.627 --> 22:16.345
Okay, let's focus on business.

22:16.370 --> 22:19.628
"Vanity Fair" wants to put you on
the cover of their fall movie issue,

22:19.653 --> 22:21.589
and they'd like you to
speak to their photographer.

22:21.613 --> 22:23.002
To shoot?

22:23.004 --> 22:24.580
No, just to go over concepts.

22:24.605 --> 22:26.539
DeAnn... I'm in no head-space

22:26.564 --> 22:28.810
to have a creative
conversation right now.

22:29.410 --> 22:30.709
I just can't stop thinking about Megan

22:30.733 --> 22:32.841
and the way she looked at me.

22:32.866 --> 22:34.732
I know.

22:34.757 --> 22:36.649
This whole thing is a huge risk.

22:37.111 --> 22:39.051
But we...

22:39.053 --> 22:41.534
should think about two months from
now when the magazine comes out.

22:41.558 --> 22:44.924
Just how exactly am I supposed to
think about two months from now?

22:44.926 --> 22:47.369
- I don't know what's gonna happen.
- I do.

22:47.394 --> 22:48.627
Two months from now, "The Kill Plan"

22:48.651 --> 22:50.450
will be raking in the
money at the box office,

22:50.452 --> 22:53.354
and you are going to be prepping
to direct "Technicolor Highway"

22:53.379 --> 22:57.046
with Megan as your leading
lady and your fiancÃ©e.

22:57.071 --> 22:59.642
Except you don't know that.

22:59.667 --> 23:01.252
Well...

23:01.254 --> 23:03.354
when I really want
something from the universe,

23:03.356 --> 23:05.766
I choose to be optimistic.
You should, too.

23:05.791 --> 23:08.267
Wow. That is some sage,

23:08.292 --> 23:11.219
self-helpy bullshit.

23:12.832 --> 23:14.164
It's all I got right now.

23:20.973 --> 23:22.640
This doesn't look good.

23:22.642 --> 23:24.608
This inhibitor induces something similar

23:24.610 --> 23:26.176
to a withdrawal state.

23:26.178 --> 23:29.013
Not pleasant, but the brain
activity is very vivid.

23:29.015 --> 23:31.218
All without the corresponding addiction.

23:31.257 --> 23:33.849
You could say the
addiction is dishonestly.

23:33.874 --> 23:36.687
You could, but that's not scientific.

23:36.689 --> 23:38.789
Whatever she's accessing,

23:38.791 --> 23:40.906
I'd say it's pretty deep in the vault.

23:57.944 --> 23:59.243
Yo!

23:59.245 --> 24:01.745
Ho! Please tell me you're alone.

24:01.747 --> 24:04.328
I'm looking for Evan. Does he live here?

24:04.353 --> 24:06.195
Depends on who's asking.

24:06.220 --> 24:08.886
I'm Megan, I'm his stepsister.

24:08.888 --> 24:10.521
Stepsister? That works.

24:10.523 --> 24:11.923
Come on in.

24:12.758 --> 24:14.091
Maybe drop your backpack.

24:14.093 --> 24:16.060
You're gonna knock people
over with that thing.

24:16.062 --> 24:18.028
Okay.

24:20.333 --> 24:22.502
And can I get you a drink?

24:22.527 --> 24:24.018
Some champagne, something stronger?

24:24.043 --> 24:26.911
That sounds cool, but
I'd like to see Evan first.

24:26.913 --> 24:29.027
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, come on.

24:29.052 --> 24:30.761
Right this way.

24:31.363 --> 24:32.650
Evan!

24:32.652 --> 24:35.253
You're not gonna believe this,
you're not gonna believe this.

24:35.255 --> 24:37.777
Look who just came to the party.

24:37.802 --> 24:39.261
My God!

24:39.286 --> 24:41.228
It's my baby sister!

24:44.030 --> 24:45.062
- Hi!
- Hi.

24:45.064 --> 24:46.464
Reunion!

24:46.746 --> 24:48.103
Hey!

24:48.128 --> 24:49.934
What are you doing in Hong Kong?

24:49.936 --> 24:51.800
I just, um... I wanted to see you

24:51.825 --> 24:53.324
and talk to you about something.

24:53.373 --> 24:54.939
- Are you okay?
- Yeah!

24:57.877 --> 24:59.877
So... what's going on?

24:59.879 --> 25:02.547
I just took some time off from school.

25:02.549 --> 25:05.332
I-I've been traveling.
I heard you were here,

25:05.357 --> 25:07.084
and I'd like to talk
to you about some stuff.

25:07.086 --> 25:08.653
I don't know if you can
really talk right now...

25:08.655 --> 25:09.921
- You've got a lot going on.
- Yeah, no...

25:09.923 --> 25:11.956
- If it's a bad time, I can come back...
- No, no, no!

25:11.958 --> 25:14.392
No, I'm so glad you're here.

25:16.696 --> 25:19.324
Evan! Evan, come here.

25:19.507 --> 25:22.526
- Shit.
- Come here.

25:22.551 --> 25:24.168
I gotta take care of some business.

25:24.170 --> 25:25.903
I mean, I could come
back if you're busy,

25:25.905 --> 25:27.338
- if it's a bad time.
- No, no, stick around.

25:27.340 --> 25:28.372
- We'll...
- Sure?

25:28.374 --> 25:30.801
Yeah, yeah, we'll catch
up when everyone leaves.

25:31.845 --> 25:33.911
Okay, yeah, go, go.

25:36.212 --> 25:37.828
Walter was never part of the deal.

25:37.853 --> 25:40.249
Relax, dude. I didn't tell him anything.

25:40.274 --> 25:42.884
I swear to God, man,
I'm going to kill you.

25:49.829 --> 25:52.423
Finally? Here you go.

26:09.496 --> 26:11.965
I came here because...

26:13.486 --> 26:15.934
I wanted to talk to you.

26:17.167 --> 26:20.301
Since Mom died, I've...
I've needed to talk to you.

26:21.694 --> 26:23.489
Um...

26:26.047 --> 26:28.137
You know, cancer...

26:29.469 --> 26:30.968
sucks.

26:34.774 --> 26:37.137
I wish I could've gone back,

26:38.578 --> 26:40.678
but...

26:40.680 --> 26:42.770
I'm glad you came.

26:43.627 --> 26:45.260
Look at you.

26:45.285 --> 26:47.084
You grew up to be so gorgeous.

26:47.086 --> 26:48.286
Don't say that.

26:48.288 --> 26:50.621
- It's true.
- No, Evan.

26:50.623 --> 26:52.290
What?

26:52.292 --> 26:53.991
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

26:53.993 --> 26:55.371
Evan!

27:02.168 --> 27:04.449
I was 11 years old.

27:05.805 --> 27:07.571
We were both kids.

27:07.573 --> 27:09.042
No.

27:09.370 --> 27:11.475
No, you weren't a kid, you were...

27:11.477 --> 27:13.514
You were 17.

27:13.539 --> 27:15.272
Okay? You...

27:15.615 --> 27:18.084
You took advantage of me.

27:18.459 --> 27:20.973
And it really messed me up.

27:23.489 --> 27:25.905
And I came here because...

27:25.930 --> 27:28.559
I need you to know that it wasn't okay.

27:28.561 --> 27:30.842
I need you to know that.

27:34.861 --> 27:37.295
You're so full of shit.

27:37.320 --> 27:38.836
No.

27:38.838 --> 27:39.870
Yeah.

27:39.872 --> 27:41.772
You show up here,

27:41.774 --> 27:43.107
in your little outfit?

27:43.109 --> 27:44.275
With your speech?

27:44.277 --> 27:45.742
What are you talking about?

27:45.767 --> 27:47.845
You're acting like I raped you.

27:47.847 --> 27:49.764
You did rape me.

27:49.789 --> 27:51.682
That's bullshit.

27:51.684 --> 27:52.850
Yes, you did!

27:52.852 --> 27:54.185
Come on, you know you liked it.

27:54.187 --> 27:55.886
No, I... What are you talking about?

27:55.888 --> 27:57.555
- You liked it!
- What are you doing?

27:57.557 --> 27:58.889
Stop! What are you doing?

27:58.891 --> 28:00.858
Evan! Get off of me!

28:00.860 --> 28:02.560
Evan! Stop it!

28:02.562 --> 28:04.628
Stop! Stop it!

28:04.630 --> 28:06.697
Get off of me!

28:14.038 --> 28:16.140
Get back here!

28:19.012 --> 28:21.312
Get off of me!

28:49.742 --> 28:52.779
No! No! No!

28:53.552 --> 28:55.677
Megan?

28:55.702 --> 28:57.615
Megan?

28:57.617 --> 28:59.950
Megan, Megan, where did you go?

28:59.952 --> 29:01.852
- Tell me.
- It wa...

29:01.854 --> 29:04.482
It wasn't self-defense.

29:05.358 --> 29:07.810
I was payback.

29:07.835 --> 29:10.584
It was payback.

29:11.415 --> 29:13.682
I'm sorry.

29:14.067 --> 29:16.100
I'm sorry.

29:17.827 --> 29:19.900
I'm so sorry.

29:41.068 --> 29:43.535
Now that is something to build on.

29:43.560 --> 29:45.320
If you say so.

29:45.593 --> 29:48.180
Your truths always evolve.

29:48.741 --> 29:52.831
Eventually, fear gives way
to the desire to understand.

29:52.860 --> 29:55.820
And that's when you really
start shaping your narrative.

29:57.531 --> 29:59.533
What "Vanity Fair" seems to like

29:59.558 --> 30:02.534
is when we get away from
the typical glamour shot.

30:02.536 --> 30:04.469
You know, Kyle West in a jacket,

30:04.471 --> 30:06.605
probing expression on your face.

30:06.607 --> 30:08.039
Maybe,

30:08.041 --> 30:09.541
less manufactured, a little more candid.

30:09.543 --> 30:10.976
No, actually, the opposite.

30:10.978 --> 30:13.486
I wanna do something
totally manufactured.

30:15.035 --> 30:16.748
Robert Pattinson spent a lot of time

30:16.750 --> 30:20.552
talking about his meticulous
approach to acting.

30:20.554 --> 30:22.521
So I shot him performing
open-heart surgery.

30:22.523 --> 30:24.923
I remember that. Yeah, I liked it.

30:24.925 --> 30:27.259
So I want to find a
visual metaphor for you.

30:27.261 --> 30:28.940
That's how we can make a statement

30:28.965 --> 30:31.196
about who the real Kyle West is.

30:31.198 --> 30:33.165
And who do you think I am?

30:33.167 --> 30:35.112
Well, let's talk about it.

30:37.604 --> 30:39.137
This place...

30:40.391 --> 30:42.340
is pretty interesting.

30:42.843 --> 30:45.644
I mean, what if we shot you

30:45.646 --> 30:49.520
surrounded by a group of Hare Krishnas?

30:49.550 --> 30:52.089
You think that's interesting?

30:52.114 --> 30:55.301
Well, again, I'm talking
about a visual metaphor here.

30:55.872 --> 30:59.782
Most of these people, they
came here because of you.

30:59.807 --> 31:03.175
You're a celebrity
icon of personal growth.

31:03.911 --> 31:04.996
It's bullshit.

31:04.998 --> 31:08.033
You wanna know the
real reason we're here?

31:08.035 --> 31:09.568
The truth?

31:10.804 --> 31:11.873
Every time I leave my house,

31:11.897 --> 31:14.406
this is the only place I can
go where people actually...

31:14.408 --> 31:16.332
leave me alone.

31:17.311 --> 31:20.245
I can't go to a restaurant, to a park,

31:20.247 --> 31:22.848
to the movies without somebody
wanting a piece of my life.

31:22.850 --> 31:25.957
They think that it's all fair
game for public consumption.

31:25.982 --> 31:28.864
I live in a fishbowl, man.

31:29.122 --> 31:31.590
It makes it impossible
for me to actually hold on

31:31.592 --> 31:33.892
to anything that's actually real.

31:33.894 --> 31:35.460
Wow.

31:38.499 --> 31:39.764
Sorry it...

31:39.766 --> 31:43.005
it sounds like celebrity
whining, I just...

31:43.670 --> 31:46.271
I don't know, I'm not in
a good place right now.

31:46.958 --> 31:49.241
But you're in a real place,

31:49.243 --> 31:51.343
and that's good.

32:18.639 --> 32:20.672
That's beautiful.

32:27.281 --> 32:29.044
You're back.

32:34.566 --> 32:36.847
Megan had some big breakthroughs.

32:36.872 --> 32:40.002
Took a really honest look at
herself and her non-productives.

32:40.027 --> 32:42.542
For the first time in my life.

32:43.979 --> 32:46.947
There's so much I want to tell you.

32:47.540 --> 32:49.200
I want to hear all of it.

32:49.202 --> 32:51.069
I think that's my cue.

32:51.071 --> 32:52.876
We'll talk later.

32:53.507 --> 32:56.274
Thank you. For everything.

33:09.823 --> 33:11.448
You okay?

33:12.092 --> 33:14.941
I'm nervous, to be honest.

33:14.966 --> 33:17.745
Megan, you... you have to know that...

33:18.098 --> 33:20.065
I didn't want to send you up there.

33:20.067 --> 33:21.988
- Terence gave me no choice.
- Kyle...

33:22.013 --> 33:24.995
I spent two months... at that facility.

33:25.825 --> 33:27.769
I know what it is.

33:35.248 --> 33:38.480
I did... I did go to him, though.

33:39.019 --> 33:40.552
I didn't know what else to do.

33:40.554 --> 33:44.433
Anytime my life has ever gotten too big,

33:44.458 --> 33:46.769
Terence has always been there to help.

33:46.794 --> 33:50.191
And this got way too big.

33:52.342 --> 33:54.366
I thought that if I went at it alone,

33:54.368 --> 33:56.498
that I might lose you.

33:56.917 --> 33:59.514
Terence said the Facility
was the only option.

34:01.233 --> 34:02.912
Kyle...

34:04.154 --> 34:05.654
it was the only option.

34:05.679 --> 34:09.311
- Megan, you don't have to say that.
- No, please, I do.

34:10.817 --> 34:12.684
The Facility was...

34:12.686 --> 34:14.351
incredibly hard,

34:14.353 --> 34:18.289
and I was scared at
first, and angry, but...

34:18.291 --> 34:22.226
I wouldn't know who I am
if I hadn't been through it.

34:22.228 --> 34:23.728
I've been hiding.

34:23.730 --> 34:25.163
For years.

34:25.165 --> 34:27.297
And it's undermined
everything I care about...

34:27.300 --> 34:30.235
you, my friends, my work.

34:30.237 --> 34:33.271
I don't know how this is
all supposed to work now.

34:33.273 --> 34:36.967
It's... it's overwhelming, but...

34:37.920 --> 34:40.855
at least I feel free.

34:43.516 --> 34:47.318
She's not 100% there yet, but
considering where we started...

34:47.320 --> 34:49.420
Well, the timing is perfect.

34:49.422 --> 34:52.157
It'll be good for them to be out
and about during awards season.

34:52.159 --> 34:54.835
Yeah, we'll keep an eye on her.
Make sure things stay on track.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.027
Sure.

34:58.515 --> 35:00.031
There's something you should see.

35:00.033 --> 35:01.733
What is it?

35:04.843 --> 35:06.928
It's our man, Colton.

35:06.953 --> 35:08.807
He's dead?

35:08.809 --> 35:10.542
What?

35:10.544 --> 35:12.359
Can I see?

35:16.583 --> 35:19.184
It says here that he drowned.

35:19.209 --> 35:21.553
The body was in the water
for nearly two weeks.

35:21.555 --> 35:24.231
They're waiting on a toxicology report.

35:26.899 --> 35:28.432
Thank you.

35:36.870 --> 35:40.371
I guess some people just
can't get out of their own way.

36:09.703 --> 36:11.398
Everything okay?

36:13.106 --> 36:15.273
I couldn't sleep.

36:19.479 --> 36:20.912
Hey.

36:20.914 --> 36:22.453
What is it?

36:23.250 --> 36:24.984
I just...

36:26.153 --> 36:29.351
I couldn't stop thinking
about losing you.

36:29.756 --> 36:31.923
Babe, you're not gonna lose me.

36:31.925 --> 36:33.725
I'm right here.

36:33.727 --> 36:35.914
I know you are, but...

36:36.630 --> 36:38.763
what if things don't go well?

36:38.765 --> 36:41.609
What if I go back to the way I was?

36:42.340 --> 36:44.640
Hey, that's not gonna happen.

36:44.665 --> 36:46.485
I promise.

37:04.626 --> 37:07.023
So you're gonna get some softball
questions about "The Kill Plan,"

37:07.047 --> 37:08.595
but what they're really
gonna wanna know about

37:08.619 --> 37:10.275
are plans for the wedding.

37:10.277 --> 37:12.460
Ooh, we should really figure that out.

37:12.485 --> 37:14.321
We'll be coy and mysterious.

37:14.346 --> 37:16.348
Great, and see if you can
steer them in the direction

37:16.350 --> 37:17.516
of "Technicolor Highway."

37:17.518 --> 37:18.952
New frontier for Kyle,

37:18.977 --> 37:21.486
chance for the two of you to
work together... like that.

37:21.488 --> 37:24.000
We still have a few minutes.
Do you want to workshop it?

37:24.025 --> 37:27.399
I think it's more natural
if I do it off the cuff.

37:28.195 --> 37:31.029
I'm wondering if I should
talk about the Institute.

37:32.933 --> 37:36.329
I don't have to, I just
want to know if it's okay.

37:36.571 --> 37:38.383
If it feels right.

37:46.393 --> 37:48.211
Megan. Megan!

37:48.236 --> 37:50.103
Hey, Les.

37:50.907 --> 37:52.851
Why haven't you
returned any of my calls?

37:52.853 --> 37:54.753
Megan, can I take you to the press line?

37:54.755 --> 37:56.388
Take three steps back.

37:57.844 --> 38:00.325
Look, I need you to know
there was nothing I could do

38:00.327 --> 38:01.625
- to stop Terence.
- Leslie...

38:01.650 --> 38:03.728
He threatened me... we had
to lie about where you were.

38:03.752 --> 38:05.118
Leslie, it's okay.

38:05.143 --> 38:07.744
I don't blame anybody for it.

38:07.769 --> 38:10.168
It was all for the best.

38:10.170 --> 38:12.637
You're still my client, Megan.

38:12.639 --> 38:14.532
It's good to see you.

38:20.013 --> 38:21.394
So, just between us,

38:21.419 --> 38:24.049
can you give me a hint of what
you're planning for the wedding?

38:24.051 --> 38:27.519
Yeah, believe me, I
would, but she'd kill me.

38:27.521 --> 38:29.921
Well, I can tell you this:

38:29.923 --> 38:33.425
That one of us will be
wearing a very nice dress.

38:33.427 --> 38:35.275
Yeah, I look great in white.

38:35.300 --> 38:37.229
Okay, all right, all right, I get it.

38:37.231 --> 38:39.355
Megan, tell me, you're getting married,

38:39.380 --> 38:41.314
you're doing this
movie with your fiancÃ©.

38:41.339 --> 38:45.214
Do you ever just pinch yourself
to make sure this isn't a dream?

38:45.239 --> 38:48.253
Well, it is dreamy, but...

38:48.278 --> 38:51.475
Kyle has been really great
about helping me stay grounded

38:51.478 --> 38:53.494
and focused on what really matters.

38:53.496 --> 38:55.519
That's great. And it's
so great to see you both.

38:55.544 --> 38:57.097
- Enjoy the evening.
- Thank you.

38:57.122 --> 38:58.787
- Thank you so much.
- Bye, guys.

38:58.812 --> 39:00.037
Shall we?

39:06.026 --> 39:08.493
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

39:08.495 --> 39:10.629
I used to think that my resistance

39:10.631 --> 39:13.935
was some kind of five-headed monster,

39:13.960 --> 39:17.802
but at least I know now I
have the ability to pick it up

39:17.804 --> 39:19.638
and put it to the side.

39:19.640 --> 39:22.073
It's easier said than
done sometimes, but...

39:22.075 --> 39:23.920
when I can get out of that trap,

39:23.945 --> 39:27.309
I really start to see what
my life could look like.

39:32.786 --> 39:34.701
Thank you, Vanessa.

39:36.823 --> 39:38.790
All right. Shark time.

39:38.792 --> 39:39.925
All looking beautiful.

39:39.927 --> 39:41.226
More bubbles, please.

39:41.228 --> 39:42.888
Lovely. You got the paper?

39:42.913 --> 39:44.195
He's got the trophy.

39:44.197 --> 39:45.997
And run away, NayNay!

39:48.312 --> 39:50.709
This is all you, man.

40:02.674 --> 40:05.579
Beautiful. King of the sea.

40:07.554 --> 40:11.523
So how was the personal
mythology workshop?

40:11.525 --> 40:13.590
- Really, really good.
- Yeah?

40:13.615 --> 40:16.160
You know, lots of stories to unwind.

40:16.185 --> 40:18.355
Was it that way for you?

40:18.832 --> 40:20.231
Sure.

40:22.035 --> 40:24.722
So tell me about the
job. How's it going?

40:26.371 --> 40:28.071
It's fine.

40:31.619 --> 40:35.788
Megan, are we just not gonna
talk about what happened to you?

40:39.886 --> 40:43.655
When everything was
going down with Colton,

40:43.657 --> 40:47.092
why didn't you tell
Terence about my past?

40:47.094 --> 40:49.683
Because you asked me not to.

40:51.331 --> 40:54.314
Even though you knew it
was the right thing to do?

40:54.339 --> 40:57.494
You made a commitment
to IHM, didn't you?

40:57.519 --> 41:00.238
Of course I made a
commitment, I work here.

41:00.240 --> 41:03.729
But your friendship means
more to me than a job.

41:03.993 --> 41:06.660
I hope you can trust me on that.

41:06.685 --> 41:08.318
I do.

41:08.343 --> 41:10.205
I do trust you.

41:11.251 --> 41:14.719
You're the one person in my life
who's always told me the truth.

41:14.721 --> 41:16.688
Megan, of course.

41:16.690 --> 41:18.990
And I have to be truthful with you.

41:18.992 --> 41:20.630
It's only right.

41:22.863 --> 41:26.513
I went through hell to get back to Kyle

41:26.538 --> 41:28.505
and become part of the Institute,

41:28.530 --> 41:30.325
and...

41:30.350 --> 41:33.247
now I'm here, and I need you.

41:46.466 --> 41:49.320
'Cause I'm gonna burn
the whole thing down.
