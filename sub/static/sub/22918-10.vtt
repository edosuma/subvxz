00:12.200 --> 00:14.120
[footsteps approach]

00:19.880 --> 00:22.360
[man] Good morning,
Your Royal Highness. It's 7:30.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.920
[Philip grumbles] Good morning, John.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.080
[groans]

00:39.920 --> 00:41.320
Ah!

00:41.400 --> 00:42.760
Christ.

00:43.760 --> 00:44.600
[groans]

00:46.400 --> 00:48.560
[stopwatch clicking]

00:48.640 --> 00:49.680
Ah.

[exhales]

01:01.960 --> 01:03.680
[groans]

01:07.280 --> 01:08.280
Ah.

01:12.120 --> 01:13.400
[stopwatch ticks]

01:14.640 --> 01:16.600
[panting]

01:25.200 --> 01:26.080
Ah.

01:29.280 --> 01:30.680
[exhales sharply]

01:32.080 --> 01:33.400
[breathes heavily]

01:33.480 --> 01:34.480
Ah.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.240
[exhales]

01:41.880 --> 01:43.800
-Go on, man. Click it.
-I can't, sir.

01:43.880 --> 01:46.520
-This needs to be seen by a professional.
-Don't be so bloody wet.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.360
-It just needs a good sharp...
-[crack]

01:49.440 --> 01:50.280
[car approaches]

01:59.400 --> 02:01.760
[Philip] It doesn't fill one
with confidence.

02:01.840 --> 02:03.760
-He comes very highly recommended.
-Mm.

02:03.840 --> 02:07.840
Treats everyone. Winston Churchill,
Duncan Sandys, Lord Astor.

02:08.360 --> 02:11.200
[church bells ring in the distance]

02:16.400 --> 02:18.040
[footsteps]

02:18.120 --> 02:20.200
[Philip]  I woke up, turned my head
and there it was.

02:20.280 --> 02:23.160
I must have cricked it
during the course of the night.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.640
Hmm. It's possible.

02:25.720 --> 02:27.600
Can you sit up, please,
Your Royal Highness?

02:27.680 --> 02:29.360
[Philip groans]

02:33.880 --> 02:39.240
People come to me with necks,
backs, elbows, knees.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.160
[Philip] Hmm.

02:40.240 --> 02:42.280
Very often it's nothing to do
with the symptoms.

02:42.840 --> 02:45.520
The real cause is something else.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.800
Such as?

02:46.880 --> 02:48.240
Ah...

02:48.320 --> 02:51.320
Tension. Emotional strain.

02:51.400 --> 02:52.720
-[click]
-[Philip] Oh...

02:54.120 --> 02:56.680
Unresolved conflicts
of one form or another.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.560
-[crack]
-[groans] Oh...

02:58.640 --> 02:59.640
[groans]

03:00.600 --> 03:02.240
-There.
-[groans]

03:03.200 --> 03:06.800
Oh, and how does one go about
treating those?

03:06.880 --> 03:10.760
Well, first by identifying them,
recognizing them,

03:10.840 --> 03:12.960
and then by treating
not just the physical symptoms

03:13.040 --> 03:16.120
but, uh, well,
changing one's whole lifestyle.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.920
I used to have a fellow
look after me in that department

03:20.000 --> 03:22.680
who made sure
there wasn't too much tension in my life.

03:23.080 --> 03:26.840
-Mike Parker?
-Surely you don't know the old rascal too?

03:26.920 --> 03:28.680
[chuckles] I do.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.200
Why didn't you say?
What is your name again?

03:32.760 --> 03:37.640
Ward, sir. Stephen Ward. He always talked
about my getting you out for the weekend.

03:37.720 --> 03:40.480
-Where?
-A party or two.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.640
I enjoy putting people together.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.880
Matter of fact, it'll be
rather a fun group this weekend.

03:46.960 --> 03:50.160
If you were agreeable, we might even
find time for a quick portrait.

03:50.240 --> 03:53.440
As you can see, I, uh... I dabble.

03:58.800 --> 03:59.840
Who's this?

04:00.760 --> 04:02.720
[Ward] Oh, Christine.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.960
Uh, she'll be there. Mandy will too.

04:08.520 --> 04:10.840
Do you know,
my neck's feeling better already.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.440
[Ward laughs]

05:32.080 --> 05:33.960
[birds cawing]

05:38.400 --> 05:39.400

05:39.480 --> 05:41.200

-[shouting]

05:42.920 --> 05:44.200
[gunshot]

05:44.280 --> 05:45.120
[man] That way!

05:51.880 --> 05:54.360
-[gunshots]
-[dogs barking]

05:54.440 --> 05:56.080
-[man shouts]
-[gunshots]

06:00.760 --> 06:04.840
[man] Christine Keeler,
do you know this man?

06:05.480 --> 06:06.320
[blows]

06:06.880 --> 06:09.440
[man] Captain Eugene Ivanov.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.160
Soviet naval attaché.

06:14.000 --> 06:14.840
No comment.

06:16.840 --> 06:22.280
[man] Did you have relations with
this man, John Profumo, Minister of War?

06:22.360 --> 06:23.360
No comment.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.880
-[gunshots]
-[dogs barking]

06:34.680 --> 06:39.640
[man]  Miss Keeler, you were at this party
hosted by Stephen Ward.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.000
Who's this man?

06:50.680 --> 06:51.960
Miss Keeler?

07:06.720 --> 07:08.720
[dog barks]

07:09.880 --> 07:12.640
[Macmillan] Splendid day.
Rather successful, I would say.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.760
-Thank you for coming, John.
-Prime Minister.

07:17.840 --> 07:19.080
-Shall we?
-After you.

07:20.560 --> 07:23.480
-Good trip down?
-Rather an early start.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.760
What was John Profumo doing here?

07:27.440 --> 07:30.360
I asked him to come and see me
so we could have a frank conversation,

07:30.440 --> 07:31.320
man to man.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.400
[Macmillan] I'll tell you
what worries me, John.

07:34.360 --> 07:38.480
It's that the many and significant
achievements of this government

07:38.560 --> 07:42.800
are being overshadowed
by scandal and rumor.

07:44.600 --> 07:45.840
Damn.

07:45.920 --> 07:49.240
Then I shall confirm for you
what I told your private secretary,

07:49.320 --> 07:51.440
and what I subsequently told the House.

07:52.440 --> 07:55.440
I have nothing to hide,
nothing to answer for.

07:56.120 --> 07:57.800
[Macmillan]  I told him to think carefully

07:57.880 --> 07:59.920
about what he was saying,
we were friends...

08:00.000 --> 08:02.840
-Shot.
-...and could speak in confidence.

08:02.920 --> 08:06.000
There are fault lines in most marriages...

08:07.440 --> 08:08.640
and I could admit to mine.

08:09.680 --> 08:10.960
[Profumo]  Come on, Harold.

08:11.520 --> 08:13.880
I didn't come to you
on bended knee six years ago

08:13.960 --> 08:17.440
begging to serve in your government
only to make a fool of you.

08:19.840 --> 08:20.680
Do you believe him?

08:23.360 --> 08:26.320
In the course of my life, I've learned
to recognize the face of a liar.

08:27.200 --> 08:30.040
Something in the features
is drawn differently.

08:35.240 --> 08:36.240
Something in the eyes.

08:41.480 --> 08:42.720
What other option is there?

08:42.799 --> 08:46.480
To distrust those close to me,
those who profess to love me?

08:46.560 --> 08:47.720
That would be too painful.

08:50.240 --> 08:53.200
-And the photograph?
-Which photograph?

08:54.640 --> 08:58.920
At a party, hosted by one Stephen Ward.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.760
Society osteopath.

09:01.800 --> 09:05.080
A call girl and a Russian spy
in the foreground.

09:05.160 --> 09:07.160
-In the background--
-[Macmillan] A shadow.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.120
A shadow with Profumo's likeness.

09:10.200 --> 09:14.760
If you say so.
I say there's reasonable doubt.

09:17.120 --> 09:20.480
[Dorothy] Credulous, trusting fool.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.120
[Dorothy sighs]

09:30.680 --> 09:33.200
[Macmillan] In my six years
as Prime Minister,

09:33.280 --> 09:36.880
I have had to face
many grave and baffling difficulties.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.760
This is one such occasion.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.800
I would like to make it clear

09:42.720 --> 09:46.600
that I believe John Profumo is entitled
not only to the support,

09:47.600 --> 09:52.360
but also to the sympathetic understanding
and confidence of the House

09:52.440 --> 09:54.320
and of the entire country.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.720
-Thank you.
-[journalist] Who's the mystery man, sir?

09:58.480 --> 10:01.480
[woman] It was bad enough
with just the music and shouting

10:01.560 --> 10:03.440
at all hours of the day and night.

10:05.080 --> 10:07.480
Yes, well,
Margaret's always been high-spirited.

10:07.560 --> 10:11.280
But this building work is unbearable.
Unbearable.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.520
And no sign of it ending.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.000
-And now a new roof.
-So I gather.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.400
Banging and hammering and drilling,

10:18.920 --> 10:20.560
sometimes even at the weekends.

10:20.640 --> 10:22.840
And it's not just me that's suffering.

10:23.680 --> 10:25.600
I know it's driven the Gloucesters
quite mad.

10:25.680 --> 10:28.040
Oh, everything irritates the Gloucesters.

10:29.320 --> 10:30.280
[Elizabeth] Ah!

10:30.840 --> 10:32.960
-[man] Sir John Weir, Your Majesty.
-Thank you.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.280
Don't worry, Aunt Marina.

10:35.360 --> 10:38.240
As head of the family,
it's what I'm here for.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.160
-I'll have a word with Margaret.
-Thank you.

10:50.880 --> 10:53.120
-Your Majesty.
-[exhales] Sir John.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.040
[door closes]

10:54.120 --> 10:57.040
As you know, we took the samples
yesterday. We've had the results back.

10:57.120 --> 11:00.400
I am delighted to confirm
that you are expecting.

11:01.520 --> 11:03.000
-Oh!
-[Sir John laughs]

11:03.080 --> 11:05.040
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

11:05.120 --> 11:08.880
[Sir John] Now, it's wonderful news,
but I must temper it with caution.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.520
Your iron levels are low, very low.

11:11.600 --> 11:14.360
Not dangerous yet, but not far off.

11:14.440 --> 11:15.360
Oh...

11:18.280 --> 11:19.760
-Hello.
-[man] Ma'am.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.320
[Elizabeth] I hope you're sitting down.

11:30.200 --> 11:31.200
Philip?

11:34.920 --> 11:37.800
-His Royal Highness is away, ma'am.
-Where?

11:37.880 --> 11:39.960
[man] At a house party, for the weekend.

11:40.760 --> 11:45.440
The weekend? It's Wednesday.
He never mentioned anything.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.520
It was all very last minute.

11:49.520 --> 11:50.520
Oh.

11:51.160 --> 11:53.280
Yes, of course. Thank you.

11:53.360 --> 11:54.360
Ma'am.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.400
[radio message]

12:38.680 --> 12:41.040
-[journalist] Miss Keeler!
-Who's the man, Christine?

12:43.520 --> 12:45.600
-[man] This way.
-[man 2] Mr. Ward!

12:45.680 --> 12:47.280
[indistinct shouting]

12:48.960 --> 12:49.800
[car horn honks]

12:50.920 --> 12:53.400
-[man] Mr. Ward. What about Mr. Profumo?
-[camera shutter clicks]

12:55.760 --> 12:58.040
[gates open]

13:05.120 --> 13:06.200
[Ward sighs]

13:08.320 --> 13:09.800
Thanks for letting us know.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.640
-[phone rings]
-[man] Yes, no worries, um...

13:18.880 --> 13:21.960
I've just heard that Stephen Ward,
sorry to interrupt,

13:22.040 --> 13:24.520
has been interviewed by police
and has confirmed everything.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.600
Introducing Profumo to the call girls,
the Russian spy, everything.

13:27.680 --> 13:28.520
Well, well, well.

13:29.320 --> 13:32.760
I think we can confidently expect
Profumo's resignation any minute.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.640
And the government to fall apart
shortly thereafter.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.720
You'll have to excuse me.
I'd better get to work.

13:39.680 --> 13:40.840
All right.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.840
So, it's a yes to Paris?

13:43.920 --> 13:45.800
-If you must.
-I must.

13:45.880 --> 13:48.480
Didn't you just get back
from an assignment in New York?

13:49.200 --> 13:53.040
-I did.
-And Tokyo before that?

13:53.760 --> 13:55.760
You don't think
some time at home would be good?

13:55.840 --> 13:59.280
It would be if it were a home,
but it's a building site.

14:00.360 --> 14:02.160
Her Royal Highness has decided to embark

14:02.240 --> 14:05.160
upon a major refurbishment
of our apartment.

14:06.120 --> 14:10.440
Only I thought I heard a happy rumor
that she might be expecting another baby.

14:10.520 --> 14:12.840
You did. She is.

14:12.920 --> 14:18.720
But in any marriage it's important to
find things that really bind you together,

14:18.800 --> 14:19.960
as a couple.

14:20.520 --> 14:21.600
And yours is?

14:25.040 --> 14:26.200
Absence.

14:26.280 --> 14:27.280
[car approaches]

14:36.840 --> 14:38.920
[drilling and banging]

14:42.080 --> 14:44.160
[drilling continues]

14:56.560 --> 14:58.080
-[man] Hats off.
-[man 2 whistles]

14:59.160 --> 15:00.160
[man] That's it.

15:01.080 --> 15:02.680
[man] Ma'am.

15:06.080 --> 15:07.080
[door opens]

15:07.160 --> 15:09.440
-[man] This one?
-[Margaret] I hate that. Grotesque.

15:09.520 --> 15:10.760
I don't...

15:10.840 --> 15:12.600
-Hello.
-[door closes]

15:13.040 --> 15:15.080
-[banging]
-Thank you.

15:15.160 --> 15:16.680
[banging continues]

15:18.040 --> 15:20.520
[Margaret] Yes, thank you very much.
Thank you.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.320
-Your Highness.
-Your Majesty.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.800
-[Elizabeth] Goodness.
-What?

15:27.880 --> 15:30.400
The dining table
in the same room as the kitchen?

15:30.480 --> 15:31.520
Yes.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.720
[Elizabeth] I'm not quite sure
what to make of that.

15:33.800 --> 15:37.360
It's modern. It's egalitarian.

15:37.440 --> 15:39.720
You're the least egalitarian person
that I know.

15:39.800 --> 15:42.520
[Margaret] Well, that's not the nicest way
to congratulate me.

15:42.600 --> 15:45.200
-That is why you're here?
-Congratulate you for what?

15:45.280 --> 15:48.800
Mummy didn't tell you? I'm, uh...

15:48.880 --> 15:50.680
-Are you?
-Yes.

15:50.760 --> 15:53.880
-Aw, that's lovely.
-Thank you.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.400
Due a few weeks after you.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.640
[Elizabeth] That's wonderful.

15:59.040 --> 16:02.440
But, no, that's, uh, not why I'm here.

16:03.680 --> 16:09.360
I'm here to ask that on your way
to building this great, bright, modern

16:09.440 --> 16:12.640
egalitarian home for your growing family,

16:12.720 --> 16:15.920
you might have a little more consideration
for your neighbors.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.240
[banging]

16:19.320 --> 16:20.760
[Margaret] In terms of what?

16:20.840 --> 16:24.240
I'm assuming noise and general disruption.

16:25.120 --> 16:26.560
[Margaret] Oh, I see.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.560
And who sent you
on this ugly little mission?

16:30.640 --> 16:32.000
-Marina?
-Yes.

16:32.080 --> 16:34.080
She'd do well to remember her place.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.840
As a low-ranking member
of your husband's refugee family,

16:36.920 --> 16:38.720
she's lucky to be here at all.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.880
I rest my case about egalitarian.

16:43.920 --> 16:47.440
-And it's not only her.
-Oh, is it Alice?

16:47.520 --> 16:49.120
That cantankerous old bat.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.960
-And the Kents and the Gloucesters.
-Oh, I see.

16:52.040 --> 16:56.640
The whole nasty, jealous circus,
cooped up in this ridiculous compound,

16:56.720 --> 16:59.360
furious because we got
the largest apartment.

16:59.440 --> 17:02.720
-No one's furious about the apartment.
-[scoffs] Incandescent.

17:02.800 --> 17:04.880
Positively constipated with fury.

17:05.480 --> 17:07.119
They're furious about the noise.

17:07.200 --> 17:11.599
Because it represents rejuvenation,
modernization and change.

17:11.680 --> 17:15.599
No, because it's inconsiderate,
selfish and deafening.

17:20.480 --> 17:22.640
So, how is the baby so far?

17:22.720 --> 17:26.640
Mm, it's uncomplicated, surprisingly.
How's yours?

17:29.160 --> 17:30.560
Complicated.

17:32.120 --> 17:34.360
They want me to take it easier this time.

17:34.800 --> 17:39.280
May I politely suggest you do?
Tell Philip to take some of the strain.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.160
-How is he?
-Fine. Why?

17:49.160 --> 17:51.400
Would you like to know a rumor
Tony and I heard?

17:52.160 --> 17:54.560
-No.
-Oh, it is just a rumor.

17:54.640 --> 17:58.760
But you can't deny...
there is a similarity.

17:59.720 --> 18:00.720
Look.

18:01.560 --> 18:02.760
You see?

18:04.120 --> 18:06.480
That's the Minister of War.
He's just admitted it.

18:06.560 --> 18:09.200
Profumo admitted the affair,
but he denied the photograph.

18:11.360 --> 18:14.560
There is something of Philip
in the... shoulders.

18:19.840 --> 18:24.280
The Prime Minister has asked to see you,
ma'am, as a matter of urgency.

18:30.600 --> 18:31.760
[door closes]

18:45.320 --> 18:46.400
[sighs]

18:50.520 --> 18:53.280
[Macmillan]
It's the very worst kind of betrayal.

18:54.640 --> 18:57.800
From somebody I never expected capable.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.160
I'm sorry.

19:01.840 --> 19:05.160
This dentist, Mr. Ward,
clearly has a lot to answer for.

19:05.640 --> 19:07.360
Osteopath, ma'am.

19:08.600 --> 19:12.000
Oh, well, he seems
to have orchestrated it all.

19:12.080 --> 19:13.640
He may have orchestrated it,

19:13.720 --> 19:16.120
but read the newspapers,
you'd think it's all my fault.

19:17.920 --> 19:20.120
[sighs] And for that reason,
I think it's only right

19:20.200 --> 19:22.560
that I offer you my resignation.

19:25.040 --> 19:25.960
What?

19:26.520 --> 19:29.360
The integrity of your government
has been compromised.

19:29.440 --> 19:33.640
As Prime Minister, I must accept
responsibility. I can't go on.

19:33.720 --> 19:37.640
Yes, you can, Mr. Macmillan, and you must.

19:44.120 --> 19:49.200
I would urge you to go back
and unite your cabinet and my government.

19:49.280 --> 19:51.560
Take charge of this country.

19:51.640 --> 19:55.280
Go back to Downing Street, Prime Minister,
and pick up the reins.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.440
The people of this country need stability.

20:01.520 --> 20:04.440
As do I, more than ever.

20:06.400 --> 20:07.280
Ma'am?

20:10.040 --> 20:12.960
The Duke of Edinburgh and I
are expecting again.

20:13.640 --> 20:14.960
Congratulations, ma'am.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.920
The situation is not
without its complications.

20:20.720 --> 20:25.000
I will be taking a leave of absence
for several months, in Scotland.

20:26.960 --> 20:32.400
The doctors have made it quite clear
that they'd like me to rest... completely.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.240
To safeguard the pregnancy.

20:36.280 --> 20:40.160
Which is why I need you
to hold the fort for the time being.

20:41.680 --> 20:44.120
The Queen Mother can deputize
for ceremonial matters

20:44.200 --> 20:45.600
until the child is born.

20:50.120 --> 20:51.120
Of course.

20:52.480 --> 20:53.720
Thank you.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.120
[bell rings]

20:57.800 --> 20:58.840
[door opens]

20:58.920 --> 21:00.600
[Elizabeth] Thank you, Prime Minister.

21:00.680 --> 21:02.600
It would mean a great deal to me...

21:03.800 --> 21:05.080
personally.

21:10.840 --> 21:13.840
[footsteps receding]

21:22.840 --> 21:25.920

21:28.440 --> 21:29.760
[audience laughing]

21:32.560 --> 21:34.920
[Dorothy] It was wonderful. [chuckles]

21:35.000 --> 21:38.040
-If they weren't sending up toffs...
-[door closes]

21:38.120 --> 21:41.200
...they were having a go
at government corruption

21:41.280 --> 21:43.200
or the hypocrisy of our bishops,

21:43.280 --> 21:45.760
or having a dig at
the British war effort. [chuckles]

21:46.760 --> 21:49.880
At one point
they even turned on the Queen. [laughs]

21:49.960 --> 21:53.160
-The Queen?
-It was really very funny.

21:53.240 --> 21:55.000
[laughter]

21:55.440 --> 21:56.920
We are also very much enthused

21:57.000 --> 21:59.880
about our forthcoming trip
to India and Pakistan.

21:59.960 --> 22:01.160
[laughter]

22:01.240 --> 22:03.960
Prince Philip tells me
he is very much looking forward

22:04.040 --> 22:05.600
to taking me up the Khyber Pass.

22:05.680 --> 22:07.960
[audience continues laughing]

22:09.520 --> 22:10.880
[chuckles]

22:11.640 --> 22:13.120
And then they came on to you.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.320
Um, what are you most afraid of?

22:16.400 --> 22:17.360
[Dorothy chuckles]

22:17.440 --> 22:23.240
[mimics Macmillan] "The arrival of
the newspapers in the morning." [laughs]

22:25.480 --> 22:28.200
It's no use me trying to replicate it.
I'll never do it justice.

22:29.200 --> 22:32.600
-Was it cruel?
-Not cruel, no.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.120
[Dorothy slurps]

22:34.200 --> 22:37.280
-Were people laughing?
-Yes.

22:37.840 --> 22:41.720
-Did Boothby laugh?
-Who said anything about Boothby?

22:41.800 --> 22:44.480
I'm assuming it's who
you were there with. Did he laugh?

22:47.400 --> 22:48.240
Yes.

22:48.320 --> 22:49.360
[audience laughing]

22:54.560 --> 22:56.160
Did you?

22:57.240 --> 22:59.640
Yes. You should go.

23:00.600 --> 23:02.760
See what's happening
to your bloody country.

23:12.360 --> 23:14.080
[wheels squeaking]

23:22.160 --> 23:24.240
[Philip] John, have you packed
the swimming shorts?

23:24.320 --> 23:26.680
-[John] Yes, sir, all packed.
-Good man.

23:26.760 --> 23:27.800
[thud]

23:29.680 --> 23:30.680
Hello.

23:31.240 --> 23:33.280
[Philip] Ah, hello.

23:37.200 --> 23:40.520
How nice. You're coming too?

23:40.600 --> 23:42.920
Coming? Uh, no. I'm going.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.400
-[Elizabeth] Where?
-St. Moritz.

23:48.280 --> 23:49.520
How mysterious.

23:51.440 --> 23:52.440
[Philip sighs]

23:54.560 --> 23:55.560
You?

23:56.200 --> 23:57.200
Balmoral.

24:00.040 --> 24:01.440
Separate countries.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.160
How apposite.

24:07.280 --> 24:13.080
-What does that mean?
-Appropriate, suitable, fitting, apt.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.160
I know what "apposite" means.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.640
I mean, what are you trying to say?

24:20.480 --> 24:21.920
Oh, don't worry about that.

24:23.480 --> 24:25.640
You just enjoy the mountains, dear.

25:21.760 --> 25:22.920
-[shouting]
-[groans]

25:24.560 --> 25:29.240
We have come from the very depths
of lechery and depravity in this case.

25:30.560 --> 25:37.040
Prostitution, promiscuity, perversion.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.360
[laughter]

25:38.440 --> 25:40.160
[man] The trouble and strife.

25:40.240 --> 25:42.400
-The fork and knife.

25:44.160 --> 25:48.400
But they turtle-dove her.
Know what I mean?

25:48.480 --> 25:49.480
[laughter]

25:49.560 --> 25:55.240
[barrister] What is this loose, despicable
world of Stephen Ward and his associates?

25:55.320 --> 25:57.280
[typing]

25:57.360 --> 25:58.920
[chugging]

25:59.000 --> 26:04.080
[barrister]  To look at their behavior,
it seems the values we once held dear,

26:04.160 --> 26:08.680
decency, respect, trust,

26:08.760 --> 26:10.440
are a thing of the past.

26:12.800 --> 26:17.600
In my position as Prime Minister
of this great country,

26:17.680 --> 26:21.560
I am frequently visited by many great men

26:21.640 --> 26:25.680
and often ask me
about what I am most afraid.

26:26.200 --> 26:28.000
My answer?

26:28.080 --> 26:31.960
-Events, dear boy, events.
-[audience laughing]

26:34.600 --> 26:36.200
Autumn.

26:36.280 --> 26:39.160
The arrival of the newspapers
in the morning.

26:39.760 --> 26:44.120
[barrister]  Civilized society
is no longer civilized.

26:44.200 --> 26:47.400
The ruling class has given up
on its responsibilities

26:47.960 --> 26:50.000
and no longer sets the right example.

26:50.920 --> 26:56.240
It has sunk instead
to a shrunken version of itself.

26:56.320 --> 26:58.120
[actor]  Do my eyes deceive me?

26:58.200 --> 27:00.080
[laughter]

27:00.160 --> 27:04.280
Is that really who I think it is,
staring back at me?

27:04.360 --> 27:06.800
-[laughing]
-[audience chattering]

27:10.840 --> 27:13.080
I've come to the theater tonight

27:13.160 --> 27:15.920
because I've heard
that some cheeky young satirists

27:16.000 --> 27:19.760
are making a living
doing impressions of me,

27:19.840 --> 27:26.120
which is handy, because I'm told I leave
a terrible impression wherever I go.

27:26.200 --> 27:27.760
[audience laughing]

27:30.200 --> 27:35.880
[barrister]  To them I say, "Shame on you.
Shame on all of you."

27:35.960 --> 27:39.120
Men like Ward deserve none of our pity.

27:39.200 --> 27:42.880
They are deserving only of our contempt.

27:44.640 --> 27:46.600
The time has finally come

27:46.680 --> 27:51.440
to cut out the moral rot
at the heart of British society.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.600
You will not convict the defendant

27:55.680 --> 27:59.080
just because he was
at the center of all this depravity,

27:59.160 --> 28:01.800
but because he was the orchestrator of it.

28:04.000 --> 28:08.280
Be in no doubt,
he is a thoroughly filthy fellow.

28:08.360 --> 28:10.120
[distorted laughter of audience]

28:11.400 --> 28:14.560
[barrister]  It is therefore
in the highest public interest

28:14.640 --> 28:16.680
that you do your duty

28:17.840 --> 28:19.800
and return a verdict of guilty

28:20.560 --> 28:22.360
on this indictment.

28:24.200 --> 28:27.080
[man] Court adjourned
until nine a.m. tomorrow.

30:03.360 --> 30:04.680
Understood.

30:48.080 --> 30:49.120
Your Majesty.

30:49.200 --> 30:50.480
[Elizabeth gasps]

30:53.200 --> 30:54.280
Yes, Michael.

30:56.160 --> 30:57.640
Oh, do sit down.

30:58.320 --> 30:59.920
[Michael] Thank you, ma'am.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.320
Um...

31:04.920 --> 31:09.800
Well, we've made it perfectly clear
to all that inquire

31:09.880 --> 31:13.120
that you're taking
an extended period of, uh, rest.

31:13.640 --> 31:16.760
Uh, but sometimes people insist.
The British Horse Society, for example.

31:16.840 --> 31:20.480
They're still struggling
with the approval of their, um...

31:20.560 --> 31:23.880
-Um, charitable status.
-Um...

31:23.960 --> 31:27.480
And they thought your intervention
might speed things up a bit.

31:28.760 --> 31:30.520
Yes, just leave me the paperwork, Michael.

31:33.240 --> 31:37.120
And there are one or two urgent
royal warrants that require your assent.

31:39.960 --> 31:40.960
Yes. Is that it?

31:43.120 --> 31:46.240
I'm afraid not, ma'am. One more thing.

31:46.320 --> 31:48.160
It's a little delicate. Um...

31:50.200 --> 31:52.720
The man at the center
of the Profumo scandal.

31:52.800 --> 31:54.080
Stephen Ward?

31:55.000 --> 31:56.160
Right.

31:56.240 --> 31:58.680
He's taken his own life.

31:59.920 --> 32:00.960
Goodness.

32:01.880 --> 32:04.120
At his practice, his home,

32:04.200 --> 32:05.640
um...

32:05.720 --> 32:09.920
the police found certain items,
among them a portrait,

32:10.000 --> 32:15.880
a hand-drawn portrait done
by Mr. Ward himself of...

32:16.320 --> 32:17.320
Of?

32:20.000 --> 32:22.280
His Royal Highness
the Duke of Edinburgh, ma'am.

32:25.640 --> 32:26.640
What?

32:27.560 --> 32:28.400
[Michael] Um...

32:30.800 --> 32:32.040
It seems they knew one another.

32:32.120 --> 32:37.360
The police also have witnesses
who saw His Royal Highness

32:37.440 --> 32:41.800
arriving at Ward's house
on several occasions, ma'am.

32:50.800 --> 32:55.360
And we were at a loss
for how to link them,

32:56.200 --> 33:00.440
but then it became clear
that they were both members

33:00.520 --> 33:03.880
of that same lunch club, ma'am.

33:05.640 --> 33:08.160
[quivers]

33:12.320 --> 33:14.320
[Michael] Now, there is some concern

33:16.080 --> 33:18.680
as to whether
there are any other portraits,

33:18.760 --> 33:21.440
not to mention
all the studies for the portrait,

33:23.000 --> 33:25.560
and that they may fall
into the wrong hands.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
I see.

33:34.880 --> 33:37.600
[Michael] We'll manage the situation,
of course, ma'am, uh...

33:38.600 --> 33:42.120
fight it off, hold back any press.

33:43.640 --> 33:46.080
But I just thought you should be aware.

33:46.160 --> 33:47.760
Yes, thank you, Michael.

33:48.400 --> 33:49.400
Thank you, ma'am.

34:14.199 --> 34:16.320
[thunder rumbles]

35:21.640 --> 35:22.920
Resignation?

35:24.000 --> 35:25.080
Yes, ma'am.

35:26.200 --> 35:31.520
Sent in the mistaken belief
that his life was in immediate danger.

35:31.600 --> 35:36.120
[Michael]  A subsequent biopsy
revealed the tumor to be benign.

35:36.200 --> 35:39.600
But the Prime Minister
has had a difficult few months,

35:39.680 --> 35:41.560
with one thing or another.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.640
[man] Is the Prime Minster well,
Your Majesty?

35:43.720 --> 35:46.640
[Michael] The impression I get is...

35:48.160 --> 35:50.400
that he's lost the appetite somewhat.

35:50.480 --> 35:52.000
[doctors and nurses] Your Majesty.

35:54.840 --> 35:55.840
What for?

35:58.360 --> 35:59.800
To go on.

36:00.440 --> 36:01.680
[exhales]

36:05.800 --> 36:07.280
[door opens]

36:12.840 --> 36:15.600
[clattering]

36:37.080 --> 36:38.920
[Macmillan] Your Majesty.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.320
Prime Minister. Ma'am. Shall we?

36:46.360 --> 36:47.360
[clears throat]

36:48.080 --> 36:50.320
How are you, Prime Minister?

36:51.880 --> 36:54.360
All the better for no longer being one.

36:55.440 --> 36:56.520
[door closes]

36:56.600 --> 36:59.360
[Macmillan] I hope you haven't come
to dissuade me.

36:59.440 --> 37:01.800
The situation's quite hopeless.

37:01.880 --> 37:03.720
That's not my understanding.

37:04.760 --> 37:07.040
The doctors told  me
that the tumor was benign.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.640
It was the size of an orange.

37:11.400 --> 37:15.720
While that causes inconvenience
and discomfort that largely--

37:15.800 --> 37:18.280
I'll still require
a long period of convalescence,

37:19.640 --> 37:25.000
not be in a fit state
to undertake the arduous duties as PM.

37:27.760 --> 37:30.800
I'm afraid my decision to resign is final.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.520
That's very disappointing,
especially after our conversation.

37:37.600 --> 37:39.720
As to who should succeed me,

37:39.800 --> 37:42.800
as sovereign you have
the prerogative to consult,

37:42.880 --> 37:44.920
but there's only one man, in my opinion.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.640
-The Earl of Home.
-Alec?

37:48.920 --> 37:51.960
-Yes, we're all very fond of him, but--
-He's the right man.

37:53.040 --> 37:55.600
A decade younger than me,
steel painted as wood,

37:55.680 --> 37:57.760
and the old governing class at its best.

37:59.120 --> 38:02.080
I would call Alec to the palace
right away, ma'am.

38:02.960 --> 38:04.720
No sense dragging things out.

38:07.320 --> 38:09.520
Is that an order, Mr. Macmillan?

38:10.080 --> 38:12.640
It would be my advice, ma'am.

38:19.400 --> 38:24.160
Do you know,
I've been Queen barely ten years.

38:26.000 --> 38:30.080
And in that time
I've had three Prime Ministers.

38:31.800 --> 38:34.360
All of them ambitious men,

38:34.440 --> 38:38.320
clever men, brilliant men.

38:40.720 --> 38:43.240
Not one has lasted the course.

38:44.560 --> 38:50.160
They've either been too old,
too ill or too weak.

38:52.640 --> 38:56.200
A confederacy of elected quitters.

39:21.520 --> 39:22.920
[nurses] Your Majesty.

39:24.520 --> 39:26.320
[crowd shouting]

39:26.400 --> 39:27.680
[car horn beeps]

39:31.080 --> 39:32.520
Get out the bloody way, you moron!

39:32.600 --> 39:34.680
-[engine revs]
-Pillock.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.240
[Jim] Get out of the way.

39:36.840 --> 39:38.720
[crowd continues shouting]

39:45.800 --> 39:47.040
[door opens]

39:54.320 --> 39:55.320
[Philip] Ah.

40:01.280 --> 40:03.840
-Tony.
-Dear boy.

40:06.480 --> 40:08.160
What are you doing here?

40:08.240 --> 40:10.560
I could ask you
the same question in reverse.

40:10.640 --> 40:12.720
What were you  not  doing here?

40:19.280 --> 40:20.520
In case you hadn't noticed,

40:20.600 --> 40:23.440
your wife has just appointed
a close family chum as Prime Minister

40:23.520 --> 40:25.800
on the advice of a man
who had no right to give that advice

40:25.880 --> 40:27.640
since he was no longer in office.

40:31.360 --> 40:33.560
It's blown up in her face somewhat.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.520
We came to see if she was all right.

40:40.640 --> 40:42.160
But she's already left.

40:43.120 --> 40:45.680
Bolted back to the safety of Scotland.

40:49.400 --> 40:50.400
Tony.

40:52.920 --> 40:54.000
[Tony exhales]

40:58.640 --> 41:01.120
So where were you, you mysterious fellow?

41:02.040 --> 41:03.880
St. Moritz at one point, I heard.

41:03.960 --> 41:05.600
Yes.

41:06.760 --> 41:11.360
That was a bit careless.
Just use me next time.

41:11.440 --> 41:15.080
I'd always cover for you, you know.
Boys' honor and all that.

41:15.600 --> 41:16.800
[Margaret] Come on!

41:17.440 --> 41:18.520
I'm coming.

41:20.240 --> 41:21.360
[whispers] Fuck.

41:42.040 --> 41:43.280
[exhales]

42:47.000 --> 42:48.040
[dog barking]

42:50.280 --> 42:51.280
[Philip] Ah!

42:52.680 --> 42:53.680
Oh!

42:54.760 --> 42:55.760
[whistles]

42:56.560 --> 42:57.920
-Good boy.
-[dog continues barking]

43:11.880 --> 43:15.080
-Here you are.
-The idea was to be alone.

43:15.920 --> 43:16.920
[snip]

43:17.920 --> 43:19.400
And hello to you too.

43:21.240 --> 43:24.480
Fine. [clears throat] If you want me...

43:25.000 --> 43:27.200
[snipping]

43:29.920 --> 43:31.360
I'll be in the main house.

44:22.760 --> 44:24.640
[exhales]

45:25.200 --> 45:26.240
[door opens]

45:31.120 --> 45:32.120
Hello?

45:35.600 --> 45:36.960
[Philip] Hello?

45:45.960 --> 45:48.520
[sighs] This is most unlike you.

45:48.600 --> 45:49.840
[Elizabeth] On the contrary.

45:50.600 --> 45:53.520
This is the most like me
I've been in years.

45:56.480 --> 45:58.520
I understand
the Prime Minister's resignation

45:58.600 --> 46:00.880
-and all that.
-It's not just the Prime Minister.

46:00.960 --> 46:03.440
-[Philip] And your mother.
-[sighs]

46:03.520 --> 46:05.640
[Philip] And your sister,
and the children.

46:05.720 --> 46:07.600
And the extended family.

46:07.680 --> 46:11.440
And the Church and the Commonwealth
and the country.

46:12.960 --> 46:15.200
The whole ghastly
relentlessness of it all.

46:17.600 --> 46:20.360
The fact it never stops, not for a minute.
I understand all that.

46:20.440 --> 46:23.000
-Do you really?
-I do.

46:23.080 --> 46:25.680
But is it not possible
that among all those problems

46:25.760 --> 46:27.800
and all those things
that are driving you mad,

46:27.880 --> 46:31.320
there are some of us
who are there for you no matter what,

46:32.160 --> 46:33.360
come what may?

46:36.760 --> 46:37.920
If only.

46:38.560 --> 46:42.200
-What's that supposed to mean?
-It means exactly that.

46:42.280 --> 46:43.680
If only.

46:54.560 --> 46:56.080
Don't punish me with silence.

46:56.160 --> 46:59.080
If you have a charge to make,
come on, be a grown-up, make it.

47:03.640 --> 47:04.640
All right.

47:07.960 --> 47:09.760
Stephen Ward.

47:12.840 --> 47:13.840
Who?

47:17.560 --> 47:19.480
The osteopath.

47:20.640 --> 47:24.400
Yeah, dreadful man. What about him?

47:27.760 --> 47:33.080
In the aftermath of his suicide,
while searching his home,

47:33.160 --> 47:38.600
detectives found a portrait,
painted by him, of you.

47:42.800 --> 47:44.520
I have no explanation for that.

47:45.440 --> 47:47.200
[Elizabeth] There were more.

47:47.280 --> 47:51.760
They had to be tracked down
and reacquired, at great expense.

47:53.200 --> 47:54.880
Can you imagine
what would have happened

47:54.960 --> 47:56.840
if the newspapers
had got hold of them first?

47:58.640 --> 48:01.280
They must've been done from photographs,
not private sittings.

48:02.040 --> 48:05.320
-But you don't deny knowing him?
-He treated my neck.

48:05.400 --> 48:08.840
-It's what osteopaths do.
-And procure women.

48:09.520 --> 48:11.960
Not for me.
I met him a couple of times as a patient.

48:12.040 --> 48:17.760
He talked the most ludicrous nonsense
about tension and emotions,

48:17.840 --> 48:21.520
so, [laughs] I went to
an old navy fellow instead

48:21.600 --> 48:24.040
who slapped me about a bit
and sorted it out straightaway.

48:24.120 --> 48:26.480
So he never invited you
to stay for the weekend?

48:29.080 --> 48:30.320
He may have.

48:31.560 --> 48:33.680
I certainly never went.

48:33.760 --> 48:35.640
And the mystery man in the newspapers?

48:37.400 --> 48:40.080
-That isn't you?
-Don't be ridiculous.

48:40.160 --> 48:42.360
I am not being ridiculous.

48:43.920 --> 48:46.040
You  are  a mystery man to me.

48:47.080 --> 48:50.200
Half the time I don't know
where you are or what you're doing.

48:50.280 --> 48:53.080
-All you need to do is ask.
-Look...

48:56.080 --> 48:59.080
I'm strong. You know that.

49:02.440 --> 49:04.480
And I can cope with the truth.

49:06.320 --> 49:08.000
I just demand to know the truth.

49:08.080 --> 49:11.440
It's when people don't tell me the truth
that I can't bear it.

49:15.440 --> 49:16.480
[Elizabeth sighs]

49:17.240 --> 49:20.480
Your recent trip to Switzerland,
which you claimed was in aid of--

49:20.560 --> 49:21.800
Dolphins.

49:21.880 --> 49:24.280
Do you really expect anyone
to believe that?

49:26.560 --> 49:27.800
Switzerland's landlocked,

49:27.880 --> 49:30.760
and St. Moritz is a winter playground
for millionaires and harlots.

49:30.840 --> 49:32.880
Switzerland also happens
to be the headquarters

49:32.960 --> 49:35.480
for the World Wildlife Fund,
of which I'm patron.

49:37.480 --> 49:40.880
But I can see that this is a question of,
of appearance versus reality.

49:40.960 --> 49:43.320
No, because some things
can only be perceived one way

49:43.400 --> 49:44.880
because they only have one meaning.

49:46.160 --> 49:47.520
Such as?

49:50.280 --> 49:51.400
Such as?

50:50.720 --> 50:51.800
[closes drawer]

50:54.280 --> 50:57.640
[footsteps move away]

51:20.240 --> 51:22.640
There are two types of people in life.

51:24.560 --> 51:28.560
Those whom one imagines to be
trustworthy and reliable,

51:28.640 --> 51:32.120
who turn out to be treacherous and weak,
like Mr. Macmillan.

51:33.760 --> 51:39.200
And those who appear
to be complex and difficult,

51:39.280 --> 51:42.560
who turn out to be
more dependable than anyone thought.

51:45.280 --> 51:46.360
Like me.

51:50.440 --> 51:53.960
I know exactly what my job is.
Your father made it perfectly clear.

51:54.440 --> 51:56.520
You are my job.

51:58.240 --> 52:01.920
You are the essence of my duty.

52:08.160 --> 52:09.320
So here I am.

52:10.400 --> 52:12.400
Liegeman of life and limb.

52:14.560 --> 52:16.240
In, not out.

52:23.040 --> 52:24.040
Philip.

52:27.720 --> 52:29.360
We're both adults.

52:32.840 --> 52:34.840
And I think we're both realists.

52:43.080 --> 52:47.920
We both know that marriage is a challenge,
under any circumstances.

52:51.200 --> 52:53.080
So I can understand...

52:55.240 --> 52:59.960
if sometimes, in order to let off steam,

53:02.360 --> 53:04.520
in order to stay in...

53:07.240 --> 53:09.960
you need to do what you need to do.

53:12.880 --> 53:16.440
-I  can  look the other way.
-Yes, I know you can look the other way.

53:16.520 --> 53:19.240
You've raised looking the other way
into an art form.

53:21.240 --> 53:23.200
I'm saying I don't want you to.

53:25.320 --> 53:26.920
You can look this way.

53:52.160 --> 53:53.160
[Philip exhales]

53:55.800 --> 53:57.080
I'm yours.

53:58.760 --> 53:59.760
In.

54:01.080 --> 54:06.360
And not because you've given me a title,
not because we've come to an agreement.

54:11.360 --> 54:13.160
But because I want to be.

54:20.440 --> 54:23.200
Because I love you.

57:03.920 --> 57:05.960
[everyone continues chattering loudly]

57:10.440 --> 57:11.840
[Philip] For Christ's sake!

57:11.920 --> 57:13.320
[silence]

57:14.000 --> 57:15.760
[baby gurgles]

57:15.840 --> 57:16.960
Take the photo.

57:19.560 --> 57:22.760
"This happy breed of men,
this little world.

57:22.840 --> 57:28.320
This blessed plot, this earth,
this realm, this England."

57:28.400 --> 57:29.640
[camera shutter clicks]
