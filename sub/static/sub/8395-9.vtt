WHAT'S IT SHORT FOR?

07:41.730 --> 07:43.698
GOSH, I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS PLAY
IN SO LONG.

07:43.730 --> 07:46.665
HI, HELLO,

07:46.700 --> 07:48.941
I'M OBVIOUSLY NOT MRS. KING.

07:48.980 --> 07:50.800

07:50.840 --> 07:54.185
THE FLU HAS BEEN GOING AROUND,
SO I AM THE ENGLISH TEACHER

07:54.230 --> 07:57.017
WHO KNOWS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
ABOUT DRAMA

07:57.060 --> 08:00.814

08:00.850 --> 08:03.239

08:03.270 --> 08:07.024
BUT I DO KNOW THAT YOUR, UH--

08:07.070 --> 08:09.061
I KNOW THAT YOUR KIDS HAVE
WORKED INCREDIBLY HARD

08:09.100 --> 08:13.139
TO GIVE YOU AN AMAZING SHOW
TONIGHT, SO SIT BACK, RELAX,

08:13.180 --> 08:14.317
AND ENJOY.

08:14.350 --> 08:17.899
[applause]

08:17.940 --> 08:21.239
THAT'S THE ENGLISH TEACHER?
HI, HOT.

08:25.020 --> 08:26.567
I'M SO GLAD
YOU GUYS COULD MAKE IT.

08:26.600 --> 08:27.737
HEY, TOM. HEY, LIZ.

08:27.780 --> 08:28.872

08:28.920 --> 08:31.150
THANKS FOR COMING.
NOAH IS DOING SO WELL.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.849
HI, KATHY, HOW ARE YOU?

08:32.890 --> 08:34.881
- NICE TO SEE YOU.
- ZOEY'S LOVING IT HERE.

08:34.920 --> 08:36.603
SHE'S JUST LIKE A BRIGHT SPOT
IN OUR SCHOOL,

08:36.650 --> 08:37.856
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH.

08:37.890 --> 08:38.925
THANKS, I'M SO GLAD YOU GUYS
COULD COME.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.336
HAVE A SEAT AND WE'LL GET--

08:40.380 --> 08:41.779
THERE'S SOME MUNCHIES
OVER THERE, TOO.

08:41.830 --> 08:44.651
MR. AND MRS. JONES,
HOW ARE YOU?

08:44.690 --> 08:46.658
WE JUGGLED HALF A DOZEN
MEETINGS, BUT WE'RE HERE.

08:46.690 --> 08:48.965
I'M GLAD THAT YOU DID, BECAUSE
DYLAN IS DOING PHENOMENAL.

08:49.010 --> 08:50.272
SHE'S JUST SO SPECTACULAR.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.288
SHE'S A STAR STUDENT, SO...

08:52.320 --> 08:53.662
MAX, WE'VE BEEN
OVER THIS A MILLION TIMES.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.667
- CAN YOU JUST STOP?
- NO,

08:54.700 --> 08:57.146
I'M MORE HYGIENIC THAN HE IS.

08:57.190 --> 08:58.976
MAX, PLEASE. MAX,
PEOPLE ARE GONNA COME IN HERE...

08:59.020 --> 09:00.089
- I AM TALLER THAN HE IS...
- CAN YOU ERASE THAT?

09:00.120 --> 09:01.872
I AM MORE ATTRACTIVE
THAN HE IS...

09:01.920 --> 09:03.364
MAX, CAN YOU PLEASE ERASE
THAT?

09:03.400 --> 09:05.186
SO, I HAVE A PROOF UP HERE OF
WHY YOU SHOULD LIKE ME BUT IT...

09:05.230 --> 09:06.913
MAX, CAN YOU ERASE THAT
AND GET TO THE PRESENTATION?

09:06.960 --> 09:08.222
UNLESS YOU GIVE ME A LOGICAL
REASON WHY YOU LIKE HIM MORE...

09:08.270 --> 09:09.749
MAX,
THERE'S NO LOGICAL REASON.

09:09.790 --> 09:11.018
THAT'S NOT IT WORKS, OKAY?

09:11.060 --> 09:13.051
I'M JUST NOT INTERESTED
IN YOU IN THAT WAY.

09:13.100 --> 09:15.068
IS IT BECAUSE I HAVEN'T
DEMONSTRATED MY PHYSICAL

09:15.100 --> 09:16.681
AFFECT ION WHICH MEANS
I'M NOW IN THE FRIEND ZONE?

09:16.720 --> 09:18.278
NO, MAX, IT WASN'T THAT.

09:18.310 --> 09:20.722
DEMONSTRATING PHYSICAL
AFFECT ION IS A VERY DIFFICULT

09:20.760 --> 09:22.341
CONCEPT FOR ME BUT I CAN TRY.

09:22.380 --> 09:24.029
- MAX, PLEASE STOP, OKAY? MAX!
- OKAY, SO HERE WE HAVE...

09:24.080 --> 09:26.036
MAX, YOU'RE HARASSING ME
PLEASE JUST STOP, OKAY!

09:26.080 --> 09:27.035
WHAT! NO!

09:27.080 --> 09:28.695
WHAT IS?

09:33.260 --> 09:38.675
SEE? THIS IS WHY I ASKED YOU
TO SWITCH PARTNERS, OKAY?

09:38.710 --> 09:39.847
DYLAN?

09:39.880 --> 09:41.814
I AM SO SORRY, THAT IS--

09:41.850 --> 09:43.124
THERE'S A MISUNDERSTANDING,

09:43.160 --> 09:46.334
TH ERE'S--MAX?

09:46.370 --> 09:47.814
BUT, SHE WAS REALLY GOOD.

09:47.860 --> 09:49.134
OH, YEAH,
I GOT A LITTLE NERVOUS.

09:49.170 --> 09:51.138
SHE WAS PERFECT FOR THE PART.
I DON'T KNOW WHY--

09:51.170 --> 09:52.649
SHE MESSED ONE LINE UP,
BUT THAT DIDN'T MATTER.

09:52.690 --> 09:54.373
- WHAT?
- NO, BUT THAT DIDN'T MATTER.

09:54.420 --> 09:55.933
- HOW DO YOU EVEN MENTION THAT?
- I'M JUST SAYING.

09:55.970 --> 09:56.891
- I'M SO PROUD OF HER.
- THOSE KIDS WEREN'T THAT GOOD.

09:56.940 --> 09:59.249
SHE WAS NERVOUS
AND I WAS 50--

09:59.280 --> 10:03.353
- OH, HEY.
- OH...

10:03.390 --> 10:05.119
WERE YOU WAVING
TO THE HOT ENGLISH TEACHER?

10:05.150 --> 10:06.219
YEAH, SHE KNOWS HIM.

10:06.260 --> 10:07.420
HE WAS MY--
OH, AMBER WENT HERE.

10:07.460 --> 10:08.802
HE WAS HER TEACHER.

10:08.840 --> 10:09.807
THAT'S ALL.
YEAH, THEY DATED.

10:09.850 --> 10:10.919
WE DATED.

10:10.950 --> 10:12.679
OH, YOU TWO DATED?

10:12.710 --> 10:13.813
YEAH, THEY WERE ENGAGED
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

10:13.850 --> 10:15.636
- ENGAGED.
- OH, MY GOSH.

10:15.680 --> 10:16.988
YEAH, IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

10:17.030 --> 10:18.816
- WASN'T TOO LONG AGO.
- HEY, GUYS.

10:18.850 --> 10:20.238
- HEY.
- OH!

10:20.270 --> 10:21.953
- WHAT'D YOU THINK?
- OH, MY GOSH, YOU WERE SO GOOD.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.308
I WAS SO NERVOUS.
OH, THANK YOU.

10:23.340 --> 10:24.853
THESE ARE FOR YOU.
THESE ARE FOR YOU.

10:24.900 --> 10:25.969
- YOU BIG STAR.
- OH, MY GOSH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.069
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU COULD SING LIKE THAT.

10:27.100 --> 10:28.681
- I DIDN'T KNOW.
- WAS EVERYONE GOOD?

10:28.730 --> 10:31.107
YES, YOU WERE AMAZING.
AMAZING.

10:31.140 --> 10:32.038
OH, THANK YOU.

10:39.500 --> 10:42.048
[whispering] OH, MY GOD.

10:46.120 --> 10:47.087
HI.

10:47.120 --> 10:48.701
SO, UH,

10:48.750 --> 10:51.196
DYLAN FILLED US IN ON
A FEW VERY INTERESTING DETAILS

10:51.230 --> 10:53.983
THAT SOMEHOW THE SCHOOL
NEGLECTED TO TELL US.

10:54.030 --> 10:55.361
LIKE, YOUR SON'S BEEN
HARASSING OUR DAUGHTER

10:55.410 --> 10:56.479
FOR OVER A WEEK NOW.

10:56.510 --> 10:57.989
NO, NO, I THINK JUST

10:58.030 --> 10:59.759
- IT'S COMPLICATED...
- OH, IT'S COMPLICATED?

10:59.790 --> 11:00.996
IT'S A LOT MORE COMPLICATED
THAN...

11:01.030 --> 11:02.236
LIKE, WHICH COMPLICATION
ARE YOU REFERRING TO?

11:02.280 --> 11:03.417
ARE YOU REFERRING
TO WHEN HE DISTRIBUTED A BUNCH

11:03.450 --> 11:05.031
- OF MALICI|\Cl)Cl)JS FLYERS?

11:05.070 --> 11:06.822
ALL OVER THE SCHOOL ABOUT ONE
OF THE OTHER STUDENTS, OR...

11:06.870 --> 11:08.076
- NO, SEE...
- OR THE VIOLENCE THAT HE
TH REATEN ED THE BOY WITH?

11:08.110 --> 11:09.691
THAT WASN'T TRUE...

11:09.730 --> 11:11.288
OR MAYBE IT WASN'T ONE
OF THE TONS OF UNWANTED GIFTS

11:11.320 --> 11:12.901
HE'S BEEN PUBLICLY BESTOWING
ON OUR DAUGHTER?

11:12.940 --> 11:14.350
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED,
DYLAN STARTED DATING AARON,

11:14.390 --> 11:15.971
AND THEN MAX GOT...

11:16.020 --> 11:18.329
WE DON'T CARE
ABOUT SCHOOL GOSSIP.

11:18.360 --> 11:19.941
- IT'S NOT GOSSIP.
- WHAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN

11:19.980 --> 11:22.869
KNOWING IS WHETHER OR NOT
YOU CHOSE TO DISCIPLINE YOUR SON

11:22.920 --> 11:24.956
FOR THESE THINGS HE'S DOING
OR IS HE JUST ALLOWED TO JUST DO

11:24.990 --> 11:26.218
WHATEVER THE HELL
HE WANTS AROUND HERE?

11:26.270 --> 11:27.885
I DID.
I SPOKE WITH MY SON ABOUT THIS.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.330
- OH, YOU SPOKE WITH HIM?
- YES.

11:29.370 --> 11:30.268
WHEN WERE YOU EVER
GONNA SPEAK TO US ABOUT IT?

11:30.310 --> 11:31.618
- OKAY, LISTEN...
- SHE'S UNCOMFORTABLE..

11:31.650 --> 11:32.924
- I GET IT.
- CAN EVERYBODY JUST STOP
TALKING FOR ONE SECOND...

11:32.960 --> 11:33.927
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.279
LET'S ALL JUST TRY
AND SETTLE DOWN.

11:35.310 --> 11:36.447
OKAY, I'M SORRY THAT
YOUR DAUGHTER IS UNCOMFORTABLE

11:36.480 --> 11:37.959
BUT I FEEL LIKE YOU GUYS
DON'T HAVE

11:38.000 --> 11:39.274
A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING
OF WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING.

11:39.310 --> 11:41.005
YOUR SON PUT HIS HANDS
ON MY DAUGHTER.

11:41.040 --> 11:42.314
- OH, COME ON.
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

11:42.350 --> 11:43.908
- DID YOU SEE IT?
- DID YOU SEE IT?

11:43.940 --> 11:45.077
THAT IS A BUNCH OF BS.

11:45.110 --> 11:46.247
HE'S NOT TRYING TO DO
ANYTHING TO HER.

11:46.290 --> 11:47.518
HE IS HARASSING HER,
HE INTIMIDATED HER...

11:47.560 --> 11:48.731
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK THIS IS A CASE

11:48.770 --> 11:50.909
OF A COUPLE OF ABSENTEE PARENTS

11:50.950 --> 11:53.350
TRYING TO BLAME SOMEBODY ELSE
FOR THEIR OWN OBLIVION

11:53.400 --> 11:54.469
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HOME.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.013
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
WATCHING YOUR DAUGHTER.

11:56.060 --> 11:57.778
MAYBE IF YOU WERE HOME
YOU'D KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON.

11:57.820 --> 11:59.082
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THANKS A LOT.

11:59.130 --> 12:01.018
THIS HAS BEEN REALLY
EYE-OPENING FOR US.

12:01.060 --> 12:02.470
YEAH, IT'S EYE OPENING
FOR ME TOO.

12:02.510 --> 12:04.432
YOU ONLY SEE THROUGH THE LENS
OF YOUR SON, OBVIOUSLY.

12:04.480 --> 12:05.993
- THAT IS NOT TRUE.
- THANKS A LOT.

12:06.030 --> 12:08.442
THAT IS NOT TRUE. WE'RE HERE
FOR ALL THE KIDS, OKAY.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.926
WELL, NOT FOR OUR DAUGHTER
ANYMORE.

12:10.970 --> 12:11.959
- COME ON, DYLAN.
- NO.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.342
WE'RE GOING, YOU'RE GOING.

12:13.380 --> 12:15.416
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.

12:23.810 --> 12:26.392
[knock on door]

12:26.430 --> 12:27.419
- HI, DREW.
- HEY.

12:27.470 --> 12:28.801
ZEEK'S STILL GETTING READY.

12:28.850 --> 12:29.874
OH, OKAY.
IT'S FINE.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.569
WHY DON'T YOU COME IN A SEC?

12:31.610 --> 12:33.362
UM, I THINK HE TOLD ME
TO WAIT IN THE CAR

12:33.400 --> 12:34.810
IF HE WASN'T READY YET, SO...

12:34.850 --> 12:37.227
- I MADE SOME COOKIES.
- OH, I'M FULL.

12:37.270 --> 12:39.431
COME ON, HAVE SOME COOKIES.

12:39.480 --> 12:40.549
OKAY, IS ZEEK--

12:40.580 --> 12:42.093
CAN HE HAVE COOKIES?

12:42.140 --> 12:44.472
- LOOK, THERE ARE NO COOKIES.
- THERE'S WHAT?

12:44.520 --> 12:46.203
GAME'S OVER, BOY,
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

12:46.240 --> 12:47.343
WHAT DO YOU--
NOTHING'S GOING ON.

12:47.380 --> 12:48.586
- OH, DREW.
- WHAT?

12:48.620 --> 12:49.791
YOU GOT TO COME CLEAN. LOOK,

12:49.830 --> 12:51.274
IF HE'S SNEAKING AROUND,

12:51.320 --> 12:52.526
DOING STUFF
THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR HIS HEALTH

12:52.560 --> 12:53.527
I HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

12:53.560 --> 12:57.428
OKAY, CAN HE FLY?

12:57.460 --> 12:59.382
- OH, COME ON!
- IS THAT BAD?

12:59.430 --> 13:00.419
WHERE DOES HE THINK
HE'S GOING?

13:00.460 --> 13:01.939
IT'S NOTHING.
IT'S NOT BOOKED OR ANYTHING...

13:01.980 --> 13:03.493
OH, WELL GOOD.

13:03.540 --> 13:04.609
- IT'S NOT GONNA BE BOOKED.
- I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT.

13:04.640 --> 13:05.982
- HEY, DREW, IS THAT YOU?
- YEAH.

13:06.020 --> 13:07.988
PLEASE, JUST DON'T TELL HIM.
OKAY?

13:08.020 --> 13:09.464
- I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
- OKAY, WELL JUST MAKE

13:09.510 --> 13:11.432
SURE THAT THE CREDIT CARD
DOESN'T COME OUT, OKAY?

13:11.480 --> 13:12.856
JUST YOU CAN'T TELL HIM
THAT I TOLD YOU...

13:12.890 --> 13:14.232
HE'S NOT PLANNING
ANY SECRET TRIPS TO MEXICO

13:14.270 --> 13:15.339
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

13:15.380 --> 13:16.267
HEY, GRANDSON,
I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU.

13:16.310 --> 13:17.823
OKAY, COME ON.

13:17.860 --> 13:19.373
WE GOT TO HIT THE ROAD.

13:19.410 --> 13:22.277
MILLIE, I DO NOT NEED YOU
TO WORRY SO MUCH.

13:22.310 --> 13:24.244
EVERYTHING WILL BE EXPLAINED
IN GOOD TIME.

13:24.280 --> 13:26.487
COME ON.

13:26.520 --> 13:28.932

13:36.020 --> 13:37.328

- YEAH, HOLD ON.

13:37.360 --> 13:39.043
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE WITH THESE.

13:39.090 --> 13:41.365
HEY, SO I WAS

13:44.650 --> 13:46.368
WELL, I JUST

13:46.410 --> 13:49.163
IT'S A FAMILY THING AND I KNOW

13:49.200 --> 13:51.441
AND I DON'T WANT RUBY TO FEEL
UN--YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE MOM,

13:51.480 --> 13:52.993

14:00.180 --> 14:02.626
YOU'RE THE BEST THING THAT EVER
HAPPENED TO ME SO, YOU KNOW,

14:02.660 --> 14:05.117
IF I WANT YOU TO GO
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO.

14:05.150 --> 14:07.459
AND I DO WANT YOU TO GO.
I LIKE YOU IN RUBY'S LIFE.

14:07.500 --> 14:10.321
WHAT--IS IT ABOUT TH E--

14:10.360 --> 14:11.588
IS IT JOHNNY ROCKET?

14:11.640 --> 14:13.528
IS IT ABOUT MARK?

14:13.570 --> 14:14.946
NO.

14:14.990 --> 14:16.366
'CAUSE I GET THAT.

14:16.400 --> 14:19.528
I MEAN, I...
I'M ASKING A LOT I KNOW.

14:19.580 --> 14:21.502
FIRST OF ALL JUST GOING
TO THIS THING.

14:21.550 --> 14:23.438
IT'S A KID'S HIGH SCHOOL THING.

14:23.480 --> 14:26.540
IT'S UH, LET'S BE HONEST, SOME
OF THOSE KIDS, THOUGH RIGHT?

14:26.580 --> 14:29.299
COME ON NOW, RUBY'S GOOD,
BUT HERE'S THE THING,

14:29.350 --> 14:32.274
I'M LEARNING
TO COMMUNICATE RIGHT?

14:32.310 --> 14:35.689
WHEN THINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO ME.

14:35.730 --> 14:38.415
AND, UH, THAT'S THIS.

14:38.460 --> 14:41.429
THAT'S ONE OF THESE--
THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS.

14:45.050 --> 14:49.430
IT'S NOT ABOUT MARK.

14:49.470 --> 14:51.609
IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE TO SEE HIM,

14:51.640 --> 14:55.292
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE I WISH
FOR THINGS TO BE DIFFERENT.

14:55.340 --> 14:58.548
- IT JUST BRINGS UP A LOT OF--
- YEAH.

14:58.580 --> 15:00.616
BUT LISTEN,
YOU'RE TELLING ME

15:00.650 --> 15:05.064
THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

15:05.110 --> 15:09.729
AND SO, I'D LIKE TO GO.

15:09.770 --> 15:10.691
FOR REAL, YEAH?

15:10.730 --> 15:13.733
FOR REAL.

15:13.770 --> 15:16.113
OKAY, GOOD.

15:16.150 --> 15:19.426
WILL I KNOW

15:19.470 --> 15:24.328
IN THIS ROMANCE...

15:24.370 --> 15:26.531
REALLY HAD TO BE VITELLI'S?

15:26.580 --> 15:28.468
I WAS GONNA PICK THAT TABLE
OVER THERE.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.023
YOU KNOW, THAT'S
WHERE WE HAD OUR FIRST DATE.

15:30.060 --> 15:31.266
BUT THE OLD COUPLE TOOK IT

15:31.300 --> 15:34.133
SO, I HAD TO SETTLE FOR WHERE WE

15:34.170 --> 15:35.717
ATE WHEN WE FIRST FOUND
OUT YOU WERE PREGNANT WITH SYD.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.443
JOEL, I REMEMBER.

15:37.480 --> 15:38.720
YOU REMEMBER WE USED
TO COME HERE

15:38.760 --> 15:40.648
WHEN YOU WERE IN LAW SCHOOL
ALL THE TIME AND WE...

15:40.690 --> 15:42.555
ALL RIGHT,
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS...

15:42.590 --> 15:44.319
- IS IT TOO SUBTLE?
- WE BOTH HAVE THINGS

15:44.350 --> 15:45.760
THAT WE WANT TO SAY.

15:45.800 --> 15:48.075
- YEAH.
- SO?

15:48.110 --> 15:49.589
- THERE'S--THERE'S THE MAN.
- YOU TWO!

15:49.630 --> 15:51.450
- HEY, GINO.
- GINO, GREAT TO SEE YOU.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.775
WHAT'S UP? I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU?
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

15:53.810 --> 15:55.778
- BUSY.
- YEAH, BUSY.

15:55.810 --> 15:58.153
- CHICKEN PARM, TWO ICED TEAS?
- OH, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

15:58.190 --> 16:00.431
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST GONNA
GO FOR A COFFEE, THANK YOU.

16:00.470 --> 16:05.407
- COMING RIGHT UP.
- THANKS, GINO.

16:05.440 --> 16:09.376
YOU KNOW, I WAS SITTING HERE
THINKING ABOUT ALL THE DREAMS

16:09.410 --> 16:11.275
I HAD BACK IN THOSE DAYS,

16:11.310 --> 16:15.724
YOU KNOW, FOR US.

16:15.760 --> 16:20.345
CREATING A LIFE TOGETHER
AND STARTING A FAMILY,

16:20.390 --> 16:23.450
AND HOW WE WERE GONNA
BE THIS

16:23.490 --> 16:28.109
JUST INCREDIBLE TEAM.

16:28.150 --> 16:30.425
AND WE DID THAT.

16:30.470 --> 16:36.431
I MEAN, JULIA, WE DID THAT.

16:36.470 --> 16:40.292
AND THEN WHEN THINGS
DERAILED LAST YEAR

16:40.340 --> 16:44.231
I WAS SO CONFUSED

16:44.270 --> 16:47.546
AND HURT ABOUT WHATEVER
HAPPENED WITH ED...

16:47.590 --> 16:50.036
AND DON'T THINK THAT I
DON'T BEAT MYSELF UP ABOUT THAT.

16:50.070 --> 16:52.652
- I'M FULLY AWARE THAT I...
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.452
- I AM IN THE WRONG.- IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT HAPPENED.

16:54.490 --> 16:59.427
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT HAPPENED WITH ED.

16:59.460 --> 17:02.020
BECAUSE I AM THE ONE
WHO WALKED OUT.

17:06.710 --> 17:10.089
I WALKED OUT ON YOU.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.189
AND I WALKED OUT ON OUR KIDS.

17:16.790 --> 17:18.712
YOU KNOW, I TOOK A VOW TO YOU.

17:18.760 --> 17:20.478
I MADE A VOW

17:20.520 --> 17:24.559
WHEN WE GOT MARRIED
THAT I WOULD--

17:24.590 --> 17:27.206
THAT I WOULD
UPHOLD OUR MARRIAGE,

17:27.250 --> 17:28.581
GOOD TIMES AND BAD

17:28.630 --> 17:31.599
AND ALL THAT.

17:31.630 --> 17:35.691
AND I FAILED.

17:35.740 --> 17:38.846
I FAILED YOU.

17:38.880 --> 17:43.635
AND I FELT SUCH SHAME, JULIA.

17:43.680 --> 17:45.568
I MEAN, I FELT LIKE I DIDN'T
EVEN DESERVE TO BE

17:45.610 --> 17:47.669
IN YOUR LIFE ANYMORE.

17:52.140 --> 17:55.132
BUT SO LONG AS YOU'RE MY WIFE,

17:55.170 --> 17:58.344
SO LONG AS
WE'RE STILL MARRIED,

17:58.380 --> 18:01.895
I AM GONNA DO EVERYTHING
IN MY POWER

18:01.940 --> 18:03.794
TO UPHOLD THOSE VOWS.

18:09.670 --> 18:12.798
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

18:12.850 --> 18:16.843
I HAVE NEVER STOPPED LOVING YOU.

18:16.880 --> 18:20.190
AND I AM GONNA HONOR YOU

18:20.230 --> 18:23.540
FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS

18:23.580 --> 18:26.196
IF YOU'LL HAVE ME.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.726
I'M GONNA GO.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.356
- HEY, HONEY.
- HI.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.254
- YOU CAN HAVE A SEAT.
- OKAY.

18:54.510 --> 18:56.819
LISTEN, I JUST WANT
TO SAY TO YOU THAT I AM SO,

18:56.850 --> 18:59.717
SO SORRY FOR NOT ADDRESSING
MAX'S BEHAVIOR...

18:59.750 --> 19:01.570
- NO...
- NO, IT WAS TOTALLY MY FAULT.

19:01.620 --> 19:03.781
I DIDN'T PROTECT YOU
AND AS HEADMASTER

19:03.830 --> 19:05.969
I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY,
HONEY, OKAY?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.797
AND I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT MOVING FORWARD,

19:07.830 --> 19:09.695
THAT WILL NEVER
HAPPEN AGAIN, OKAY?

19:09.730 --> 19:11.379
I UNDERSTAND THAT MAX
CAN'T HELP IT.

19:11.420 --> 19:12.899
I KNOW.
I JUST--

19:12.940 --> 19:14.794
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU
FEEL PROTECTED AND FEEL SECURE,

19:14.840 --> 19:15.659
OKAY?

19:19.600 --> 19:22.535
DYLAN, WHAT'S WRONG?
WHAT--WHAT IS--WHAT?

19:22.570 --> 19:24.777
IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE?

19:24.810 --> 19:28.189
MY PARENTS WANT TO
SWITCH SCHOOLS.

19:28.230 --> 19:31.779
OKAY, UM, I KNOW.

19:31.820 --> 19:34.334
I THINK MAYBE WHAT CAN HAPPEN
IS I CAN TALK TO THEM

19:34.380 --> 19:36.189
AND I CAN TELL THEM THAT,
THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA...

19:36.240 --> 19:38.276
NO, YOU CAN'T
BECAUSE THEY WON'T LISTEN.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.198
THEY NEVER LISTEN TO ME.

19:40.240 --> 19:42.583
THEY DON'T GET THAT THIS IS
THE FIRST PLACE IN FIVE YEARS

19:42.620 --> 19:46.522
THAT'S ACTUALLY HELPED ME.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.380
OKAY.

19:48.420 --> 19:49.591
I KNOW THAT I CAN TALK TO THEM.

19:49.630 --> 19:50.858
AND I WANT YOU HERE.

19:50.910 --> 19:52.798
I BELIEVE IN YOU.

19:52.840 --> 19:55.877
AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS
THE RIGHT SCHOOL FOR YOU, OKAY?

19:55.910 --> 19:57.423
I KNOW.

19:57.470 --> 19:59.779
AND I WILL DO WHATEVER IT
TAKES TO KEEP YOU HERE.

19:59.810 --> 20:01.607
I WILL, OKAY?

20:01.640 --> 20:03.847
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- YOU'RE SO WELCOME.

20:03.890 --> 20:05.505
IT'S OKAY.

20:05.540 --> 20:08.407
WE'RE GONNA FIX THIS, OKAY?

20:08.440 --> 20:12.331
OKAY, SO I COME ACROSS
THIS MATCHBOX.

20:12.380 --> 20:14.519
IT'S GOT A PICTURE
OF A THORNY ROSE ON IT.

20:14.550 --> 20:16.370
IT'S CALLED CAFE FLEUR,

20:16.420 --> 20:19.446
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT HITS ME.

20:19.490 --> 20:21.651
I'M TRANSPORTED BACK IN TIME.

20:21.700 --> 20:23.907
I'M SITTING AT THIS CAFE,
AND GUESS WHAT?

20:23.940 --> 20:27.353
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET
IS OUR...

20:27.390 --> 20:28.948
- IT'S THE PLACE?
- B&B.

20:28.980 --> 20:30.390
- THIS IS IT?
- YEAH.

20:30.430 --> 20:31.738
WE JUST GOOGLE THIS.

20:31.780 --> 20:32.917
YOU CAN DO THAT. WE CAN
TURN AROUND AND SEE...

20:32.950 --> 20:34.429
- FIRE IT UP...
- WHAT'S ACROSS THE STREET.

20:34.470 --> 20:35.914
LET'S GO, GRANDSON,
GOT NO TIME TO WASTE.

20:35.950 --> 20:37.747
GET IN THERE AND LET'S FIND
THIS PLACE.

20:37.780 --> 20:39.884
THAT'S IT.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.569
- OH, YEAH, THAT'S IT.
- THAT'S THE--OKAY.

20:41.610 --> 20:43.817
OKAY, TURN IT AROUND.
OH, LOOK.

20:43.860 --> 20:45.441
IS THAT IT?

20:45.480 --> 20:46.856
THAT'S IT. IT HASN'T CHANGED.

20:46.900 --> 20:48.344
YEAH, CH EZ MARIE.

20:48.380 --> 20:50.371
CH EZ MARIE?
SEE!

20:50.420 --> 20:51.967
I KNEW IT WAS A WOMAN'S NAME.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.458
THIS MIND IS LIKE
A STEEL TRAP, GRANDSON.

20:55.490 --> 20:57.867
- WELL, THAT'S IT.
- OKAY, HERE, THIS IS IT.

20:57.910 --> 20:59.286
LET'S DO IT.

20:59.320 --> 21:03.529
LET'S BOOK IT.

21:03.570 --> 21:06.562
- GRANDPA, I CAN'T BOOK IT.
- WHY CAN'T YOU BOOK IT?

21:06.610 --> 21:10.569
BECAUSE...

21:10.610 --> 21:14.671
GRANDMA KNOWS, GRANDPA.

21:14.720 --> 21:17.644
I'M SORRY, OKAY,

21:17.690 --> 21:20.443
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M
SUPPOSED TO DO WHEN SHE'S ASKING

21:20.480 --> 21:22.710
ME QUESTIONS ABOUT YOU BECAUSE
SHE'S WORRIED ABOUT YOUR HEALTH.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.443
SO, YOU TOLD HER?

21:24.490 --> 21:25.821
I DIDN'T TELL
HER EVERYTHING, NO.

21:25.870 --> 21:27.724
I ASKED HER IF IT WAS OKAY

21:27.760 --> 21:29.933
FOR YOU TO FLY BECAUSE SHE'S
ASKING ME WHAT WE'RE DOING,

21:29.970 --> 21:31.619
AND I'M TRYING
NOT TO TELL HER

21:31.660 --> 21:33.480
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT
ME TO TELL HER.

21:33.530 --> 21:35.805
BUT THEN I IN TURN
HAVE TO LIE TO HER.

21:35.840 --> 21:37.660
SO, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO THERE, YOU KNOW?

21:37.710 --> 21:39.632
YOU'RE PUTTING ME
IN A REALLY WEIRD POSITION.

21:39.670 --> 21:41.467
AND SO, I TOLD HER
THAT YOU WERE GONNA--

21:41.500 --> 21:42.808
YOU WERE TRYING
TO FLY SOMEWHERE.

21:42.850 --> 21:48.368
THAT'S IT.

21:48.410 --> 21:51.743
GOD, YOU KNOW,

21:51.790 --> 21:54.782
THIS IS GONNA BE A SPECIAL TRIP,
DREW, YOU KNOW?

21:54.830 --> 21:56.684
YEAH, I KNOW.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.039
ME AND YOUR GRANDMOTHER,

21:58.070 --> 22:00.755
MAYBE FOR THE LAST--

22:00.800 --> 22:05.624
OH GOD.

22:05.660 --> 22:08.595
I CHOSE YOU
BECAUSE I TRUSTED YOU.

22:08.630 --> 22:10.143
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
I TRUSTED YOU.

22:10.190 --> 22:12.738
YEAH.

22:12.770 --> 22:15.352
YOU LET ME DOWN.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.391
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

22:19.820 --> 22:22.641
- JUST TAKE ME HOME.
- OKAY.

22:28.720 --> 22:30.062
[exhales]

22:30.100 --> 22:33.103
OH.

22:33.140 --> 22:34.584
- HI.
- HEY.

22:34.620 --> 22:37.032
- HOW'D IT GO?
- FINE.

22:37.070 --> 22:38.697
IT WAS FINE, CHRIS,
IT WAS FINE.

22:38.730 --> 22:41.858
IT WAS HARDER THAN I THOUGHT
SO I DIDN'T BRING UP THE PAPERS.

22:41.910 --> 22:43.172
DOESN'T MEAN I'M NOT.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN

22:43.220 --> 22:44.494
I'M HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS, OKAY?

22:44.530 --> 22:45.383
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT, THOUGH.

22:45.430 --> 22:46.419
OKAY.

22:50.190 --> 22:52.841
BUT, JULES, WHERE DOES, UM,
WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US?

22:52.880 --> 22:54.939
IN THE SAME PLACE.
NOTHING HAS CHANGED, CHRIS.

22:54.990 --> 22:56.469
EXACTLY, NOTHING HAS CHANGED.

22:56.510 --> 22:57.841
YEAH, WE'RE FINE.

23:01.650 --> 23:04.517
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY WE'RE NOT.
WE'RE NOT FINE.

23:04.550 --> 23:05.778
I NEED SOMETHING.

23:05.830 --> 23:07.889
I NEED SOMETHING TO CHANGE,
JULES.

23:07.930 --> 23:08.965
I NEED SOMETHING
MORE THAN THIS.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.797
I WANT SOMETHING MORE
THAN THIS,

23:10.830 --> 23:11.933
AND IF THIS ISN'T GONNA
MOVE FORWARD I DON'T KNOW--

23:11.970 --> 23:13.528
IT IS MOVING FORWARD.
I JUST--

23:13.560 --> 23:14.629
I NEED MORE TIME TO FIGURE
THINGS OUT.

23:14.660 --> 23:16.696
SO, YOU GONNA TELL ME WHAT
MORE TIME LOOKS LIKE.

23:16.740 --> 23:18.002
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

23:18.050 --> 23:19.620
IS IT A WEEK, IS IT A DAY,
IS IT A MONTH...

23:19.670 --> 23:21.763
I CAN'T CALENDAR IT FOR YOU.
GET OUT OF MY FACE, CHRIS.

23:21.810 --> 23:23.038
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.

23:23.090 --> 23:24.660
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:24.710 --> 23:25.847
ACTUALLY, WE DO NEED
TO TALK ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.

23:25.880 --> 23:27.609
I HAVE BEEN MORE
THAN PATIENT WITH YOU.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.437
I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING
I POSSIBLY CAN,

23:29.470 --> 23:31.028
AND I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S
A MATTER OF TIME, JULIA.

23:31.060 --> 23:33.949
I DON'T THINK THAT IT MATTERS
HOW MUCH TIME I GIVE YOU

23:33.990 --> 23:35.025
BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE STILL
IN LOVE WITH YOUR HUSBAND.

23:35.060 --> 23:36.755
I HAVE KIDS
WITH THE MAN, YES.

23:36.790 --> 23:38.542
I HAVE FEELINGS FOR HIM.
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

23:38.580 --> 23:43.825
STOP PRESSURING ME.

23:43.870 --> 23:45.963
PRESSURING YOU?

23:50.840 --> 23:52.626
OKAY, JULIA, ALL RIGHT.

23:52.670 --> 23:53.659
PRESSURE'S OFF.

23:55.570 --> 23:57.947
CHRIS.

23:57.980 --> 23:58.969
CHRIS!

24:01.640 --> 24:03.084
- HEY, MAX.
- HI, BUDDY.

24:03.130 --> 24:05.155
WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH DYLAN,

24:05.200 --> 24:08.920
BECAUSE I FEEL
LIKE WE OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

24:08.960 --> 24:10.712
I DON'T FEEL LIKE WE REALLY
GAVE YOU THE FULL PICTURE

24:10.750 --> 24:13.025
ABOUT WHAT CAN HAPPEN
IN RELATIONSHIPS.

24:13.070 --> 24:14.890
REMEMBER WHEN WE TALKED
ABOUT THE NUMBERS SCALE

24:14.930 --> 24:16.750
AND HOW THINGS CAN CHANGE?

24:16.800 --> 24:18.176
WELL, SOMETIMES THEY DON'T.

24:18.210 --> 24:20.132
SOMETIMES THEY'RE JUST STUCK
BECAUSE THE TWO PEOPLE

24:20.180 --> 24:23.968
WANT DIFFERENT THINGS.

24:24.010 --> 24:25.898
THAT'S CON FUSING.

24:25.940 --> 24:27.589
- IT IS CONFUSING.
- VERY CONFUSING.

24:27.630 --> 24:29.040
HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO TELL
WHEN THE SCALE IS FLUID

24:29.080 --> 24:31.219
AND WHEN IT ISN'T?

24:31.260 --> 24:33.080
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

24:33.120 --> 24:35.008
SOMETIMES IT'S JUST DIFFICULT,
YOU KNOW,

24:35.050 --> 24:36.938
AND YOU CAN'T.

24:36.990 --> 24:39.811
YOU JUST SORT OF GAUGE
IT ON HOW THE PERSON RESPONDS,

24:39.850 --> 24:41.670
YOU KNOW,
AND WHAT THEY'RE TELLING YOU.

24:41.720 --> 24:43.711
AND YOU ALSO
HAVE TO RESPECT THEIR WISHES.

24:43.750 --> 24:47.129
LIKE, WITH DYLAN, YOU KNOW...

24:47.170 --> 24:51.129
YOU MIGHT WANT TO BE CLOSER TO
HER THAN SHE WANTS TO BE TO YOU.

24:51.170 --> 24:53.889
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
WHEN YOU GET A HUG FROM SOMEONE.

24:53.940 --> 24:55.316
EVEN ME SOMETIMES,
I'LL TRY AND HUG YOU

24:55.350 --> 24:57.147
AND YOU DON'T WANT THAT.

24:57.180 --> 24:59.592
SO, I'LL RESPECT THAT BOUNDARY
AND I WON'T KEEP HUGGING YOU.

24:59.630 --> 25:00.904
AND DYLAN MAY HAVE FELT

25:00.940 --> 25:02.180
OVERWHELMED
BY WHAT YOU WERE DOING...

25:02.220 --> 25:03.596
[Kristina]
AND SHE JUST
INTERPRETED IT DIFFERENTLY

25:03.640 --> 25:06.017
THAN HOW YOU WERE GIVING IT.

25:06.050 --> 25:09.986
DYLAN SAID
I WAS HARASSING HER.

25:10.020 --> 25:13.569
OKAY, WELL
YOU WEREN'T HARASSING HER.

25:13.610 --> 25:14.918
DO YOU--OKAY, MAX--

25:14.960 --> 25:16.268
HARASSMENT IS DEFINED
AS AGGRESSIVE

25:16.300 --> 25:18.928
OR INTIMIDATING PRESSURE.

25:18.960 --> 25:20.689
I WAS ONLY TRYING
TO DO NICE THINGS.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.199
[Kristina]
YES, AND YOU WERE
DOING NICE THINGS.

25:22.240 --> 25:24.208
[Adam]
YOU WERE.
IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH FOR DYLAN.

25:24.240 --> 25:26.754
WE'RE JUST SUGGESTING THAT YOU
PAY A LITTLE MORE ATTENTION

25:26.800 --> 25:28.654
TO THE FEEDBACK
YOU'RE GETTING FROM OTHER PEOPLE

25:28.690 --> 25:31.830
SO THAT YOU CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT THEIR BOUNDARIES ARE.

25:31.870 --> 25:33.758
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

25:37.910 --> 25:41.084
AM I THE REASON
DYLAN'S LEAVING THE SCHOOL?

25:47.130 --> 25:48.643
I WAS JUST BACKSTAGE
WITH RUBY.

25:48.680 --> 25:51.296
- HOW'S SHE DOING?
- SHE'S IN ABSOLUTE HEAVEN...

25:51.340 --> 25:54.059
- GOOD.
- SHE'S POLITE, SHE'S ENGAGED,
SHE'S GRACIOUS.

25:54.100 --> 25:55.067
IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY
TOOK OUR TEENAGE DAUGHTER

25:55.100 --> 25:56.988
AND REPLACED HER
WITH SANDY FROM GREASE.

25:57.030 --> 25:58.918
- YEAH, YEAH, HEY.
- HI.

25:58.970 --> 26:01.109
- HI.
- HEY. HI, MARK.

26:01.140 --> 26:04.007
I'M SANDY.
HI, I'M RUBY'S MOM.

26:04.040 --> 26:06.201
- OH.
- SHE PLAYS SANDY, I'M SANDY.

26:06.250 --> 26:08.002
YOU GUYS WANT TO
CATCH UP, OR--

26:08.040 --> 26:08.938
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE GONNA BE--

26:08.980 --> 26:11.005
NO, I KNOW. I'M ACTUALLY

26:11.050 --> 26:14.599
JUST HERE ON OFFICIAL SUBSTITUTE
DRAMA TEACHER BUSINESS.

26:14.640 --> 26:19.805
SAVANNAH IS FEELING BETTER
AND SHE HAS DECIDED LAST MINUTE

26:19.850 --> 26:21.818
THAT SHE WANTS
TO GO ON AS SANDY.

26:21.850 --> 26:24.159
- LAST MINUTE.
- THEY CAN'T DO THAT, RIGHT?

26:24.200 --> 26:25.098
- WAIT, THAT'S...
- THEY--THEY CAN DO THAT?

26:25.130 --> 26:27.678
THAT'S NOT FAIR TO RUBY.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.779
I KNOW, I KNOW.

26:29.820 --> 26:32.163
I JUST FOUND OUT
AND I ALREADY TOLD RUBY,

26:32.210 --> 26:33.893
AND SHE'S REALLY UPSET.

26:33.930 --> 26:35.204
SHE SAYS SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO GO ON TONIGHT

26:35.240 --> 26:36.309
IF SHE'S JUST GONNA BE PART
OF THE CHORUS.

26:36.350 --> 26:37.897
SO, I JUST WANTED TO...

26:37.940 --> 26:39.271
- I THINK I'M GONNA GO IN...
- TELL YOU GUYS.

26:39.320 --> 26:40.719
AND TALK TO HER.

26:40.770 --> 26:43.238
HANK, COME ON.

26:43.290 --> 26:45.758
YEAH, OKAY, UM--
YOU WANT TO COME?

26:45.810 --> 26:47.766
I DON'T THINK
I SHOULD BE PART OF THAT.

26:47.810 --> 26:48.947
IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU.
HANK?

26:48.980 --> 26:52.848
IT WAS NICE
TO MEET YOU TOO.

26:52.880 --> 26:55.440
- HI.
- WELL.

26:55.470 --> 26:57.267
SUBBING AS THE DRAMA TEACHER.

26:57.300 --> 26:58.915
- YES.
- DID NOT EXPECT THAT.

26:58.960 --> 27:00.712
- NEITHER DID I.
- TWIST.

27:00.750 --> 27:02.957
THIS FLU.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.991
I JUST KEEP SCREWING UP
MY LIFE.

27:05.030 --> 27:06.167
OH, YEAH?

27:06.210 --> 27:07.711
HOW DO YOU KEEP DOING THAT?

27:07.760 --> 27:09.068
WELL, I JUST RUINED
A REALLY GOOD THING

27:09.110 --> 27:10.759
WITH A REALLY GOOD GUY.

27:10.800 --> 27:11.755
- THAT GUY, CHRIS?
- MM-HMM.

27:11.800 --> 27:13.791
- FROM THE BARBECUE?
- MM-HMM.

27:13.830 --> 27:16.105
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT'D YOU DO?

27:16.150 --> 27:20.837
I JUST--I COULDN'T
CUT THE CORD WITH JOEL.

27:20.880 --> 27:22.836
HE'S MAKING THIS SO HARD.

27:22.880 --> 27:24.393
IT'S--

27:24.430 --> 27:25.283
HOW?

27:28.370 --> 27:30.770
WELL, HE WANTS TO
GET BACK TOGETHER.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.028
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

27:36.060 --> 27:38.096
I KNOW, I KNOW,
I KNOW YOU WOULD THINK THAT.

27:38.130 --> 27:40.337
IT'S JUST
THAT I HAVE TAKEN SO LONG

27:40.380 --> 27:44.487
TO GET TO BE OKAY WITHOUT HIM.

27:44.520 --> 27:46.249
AND SO HE CHOOSES NOW.

27:46.280 --> 27:47.827
IT'S...

27:47.870 --> 27:48.894
YOU'RE JUST TALKING
ABOUT TIMING.

27:48.940 --> 27:50.316
SOMETIMES TIMING SUCKS.

27:50.350 --> 27:55.185
IT'S--NO,
IT'S NOT JUST TIMING.

27:55.220 --> 27:57.734
HE BAILED ON ME.

27:57.770 --> 28:00.227
YEAH, HE SCREWED UP.

28:00.260 --> 28:01.295
HAVEN'T YOU EVER SCREWED UP?

28:01.330 --> 28:03.742
NO, I SCREWED UP HUGE,
OBVIOUSLY.

28:03.780 --> 28:04.883
THAT'S WHAT GOT US HERE.

28:04.920 --> 28:06.012
I MEAN, I KNOW THAT,

28:06.060 --> 28:10.952
BUT I NEVER GAVE UP THE FIGHT.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.093
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

28:14.960 --> 28:19.238
AND I REALLY NEEDED HIM.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.202
AND HE WAS WEAK.

28:21.250 --> 28:24.037
IT BURNS

28:24.080 --> 28:25.900
NOW YOU ARE GONE

28:25.940 --> 28:29.216
YOU KNOW WHAT MARRIAGE IS,
SWEETIE?

28:29.250 --> 28:31.878
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S ABOUT?

28:31.910 --> 28:33.775
FORGIVENESS.

28:33.810 --> 28:35.869
IT BURNS

28:35.920 --> 28:40.129
NOW YOU ARE GONE,
I AM DONE

28:44.410 --> 28:47.925
I DON'T THINK I CAN.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.406
[Sarah]
DREW IS AT BERKELEY,
HE'S DOING WELL.

28:50.450 --> 28:53.305
- OH, YEAH.
- HE DOESN'T CALL ME ENOUGH.

28:53.350 --> 28:56.274
- UH...
- AND HOW'S AMBER?

28:56.320 --> 28:58.311
AMBER IS PREGNANT.

28:59.910 --> 29:01.070
WOW! WITH--

29:01.110 --> 29:03.522
IT'S--WELL,
IT'S A SITUATION

29:03.560 --> 29:06.074
WITH A BOYFRIEND WHO MIGHT
NOT BE IN THE PICTURE

29:06.120 --> 29:08.907
BUT SHE'S HANDLING
IT REALLY WELL AND...

29:08.950 --> 29:10.156
YEAH, SHE CAN DO THAT.

29:10.190 --> 29:12.181
IT'S JUST ABOUT SIX
WEEKS AWAY.

29:12.230 --> 29:13.913
- WOW.
- BIG CHANGES.

29:13.950 --> 29:15.918
THAT IS--
SO, YOU'RE GONNA BE A...

29:15.960 --> 29:19.168
- NO, NO, NO...
- A THING? NO?

29:19.200 --> 29:20.576
WE DON'T SAY THAT, NO.

29:20.620 --> 29:21.757
- THAT WORD?
- NO.

29:21.790 --> 29:24.338
MAYBE THERE'S, THERE'S GOT
TO BE SOME COOL, HIP NEW WORD.

29:24.380 --> 29:25.335
- I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND IT.
- YEAH?

29:25.380 --> 29:27.132
IT HAS ELUDED ME.

29:27.170 --> 29:28.967
I'M NOT SURE
IT'S GONNA CATCH ON.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.072
THERE'S BEEN A WORD
FOR IT FOR A WHILE NOW.

29:32.110 --> 29:36.388
- OH, IT'S TRAUMATIC BUT...
- THAT'S EXCITING, WOW.

29:36.420 --> 29:41.141
THAT IS JUST AHEAD OF MY WIFE.

29:41.190 --> 29:42.976
- NO, REALLY?
- YEAH.

29:43.020 --> 29:44.533
- YOU'RE GONNA BE A DAD?
- YEAH.

29:44.570 --> 29:45.980
OH, WOW.

29:46.020 --> 29:47.226
YEAH.

29:47.260 --> 29:49.364
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

29:49.400 --> 29:50.571
YEAH, IT'S EXCITING.

29:50.610 --> 29:52.225
YOU'RE GONNA BE SO GREAT.

29:52.270 --> 29:54.056
THANKS, UM, I HOPE SO.

29:54.100 --> 29:56.921
AH, THAT MAKES ME HAPPY.

29:56.960 --> 29:58.473
- YEAH.
- THAT'S GREAT.

29:58.520 --> 30:03.139
YEAH, UH--

30:03.180 --> 30:04.829
YEAH, IT'S SO SURREAL

30:04.870 --> 30:07.862
BUT I'M LOOKING
FORWARD TO IT, I GUESS.

30:07.900 --> 30:11.108
THIS IS GONNA SOUND WEIRD,
BUT I'M--

30:11.150 --> 30:14.972
I'M GLAD I KNEW YOU.

30:15.020 --> 30:18.979
I'M GLAD I KNEW YOU, TOO.

30:19.020 --> 30:20.567
I'M REALLY GLAD
THAT I KNEW YOU.

30:20.610 --> 30:22.464
IT BURNS

30:22.510 --> 30:24.319
NOW YOU ARE GONE

30:24.370 --> 30:26.258
I AM DONE

30:26.300 --> 30:28.507
- HEY.
- HEY, HOW IS SHE?

30:28.550 --> 30:30.268
OH, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF DRAMA,
A LOT OF CRYING,

30:30.310 --> 30:32.471
SANDY'S TAKING HER BACK NOW.

30:32.520 --> 30:34.545
OKAY, LET'S GO.

30:34.590 --> 30:35.579
YEAH,
IF YOU WANT TO HANG STILL.

30:35.620 --> 30:39.135
- NO, NO.
- AHEM.

30:39.180 --> 30:42.206
WELL, IT WAS REALLY NICE
TO SEE YOU, AND GOOD LUCK

30:42.250 --> 30:46.664
BEING A WHATEVER WORD
YOU COME UP WITH.

30:46.700 --> 30:49.146
AND I'M SORRY ABOUT RUBY.

30:49.190 --> 30:51.909
OH, YEAH, YEAH,
SHE'S OKAY.

30:51.950 --> 30:52.632
THAN KS.

30:55.060 --> 30:56.982
OKAY, BYE.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.144
[exhales]

31:28.300 --> 31:32.600
[gurgling]

31:32.640 --> 31:34.608
YOU'RE STILL SORE
ABOUT THE TRIP?

31:34.650 --> 31:36.709
YEAH, YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
I'M SORE ABOUT THE TRIP.

31:36.750 --> 31:38.331
GOD! I MEAN,

31:38.370 --> 31:40.167
I CAN'T EVEN DRIVE
MY OWN DAMN CAR.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.373
EVERYBODY'S TREATING ME
LIKE AN INVALID.

31:42.410 --> 31:44.344
I CAN'T EVEN SPEND
MY OWN MONEY

31:44.380 --> 31:46.063
WHEN I WANT TO SPEND IT
FOR WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH IT.

31:46.110 --> 31:47.611
NO, YOU CAN'T.

31:47.660 --> 31:49.173
NOT WHEN YOU'RE PLANNING
ON SNEAKING AROUND,

31:49.210 --> 31:51.246
DOING THINGS
THAT ARE BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH.

31:51.280 --> 31:54.932
WHERE WERE YOU GONNA
FLY OFF TO ANYWAY?

31:54.980 --> 31:56.629
FRANCE.

31:56.670 --> 32:00.185
- FRANCE?
- YEP, GONNA GO TO FRANCE.

32:00.220 --> 32:03.155
YEAH? WHAT WERE YOU
GONNA DO IN FRANCE?

32:03.190 --> 32:07.980
OKAY, WELL...

32:08.020 --> 32:10.409
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN I WROTE YOU
AFTER I GOT OUT OF THE SERVICE

32:10.440 --> 32:13.989
AND I WAS IN THIS
LITTLE VILLAGE, WES,

32:14.030 --> 32:16.066
AND THEY HAD
THIS WONDERFUL B&B THERE

32:16.100 --> 32:19.206
WITH THE BEST FOOD AND
WINE I'VE EVER HAD?

32:19.240 --> 32:20.275
- YEAH, I REMEMBER THAT.
- YOU REMEMBER THAT?

32:20.310 --> 32:22.130
- YEAH, UH-HUH.
- OKAY, WELL,

32:22.180 --> 32:24.512
I WAS, UH--

32:24.560 --> 32:27.176
I WAS GONNA SURPRISE
YOU ON OUR ANNIVERSARY,

32:27.220 --> 32:29.176
AND I WAS GONNA
TAKE YOU THERE.

32:29.220 --> 32:32.041
BACK TO THE B&B

32:32.080 --> 32:35.049
AND I FIGURED YOU COULD PAINT
ALL YOU WANTED TO.

32:35.090 --> 32:37.046
I MEAN, HELL, YOU PAINTED
ALL OVER ITALY

32:37.090 --> 32:38.739
AND FIDDLED AROUND
WITH THOSE STATUES

32:38.780 --> 32:40.361
AND GOD KNOWS WHAT ELSE.

32:40.400 --> 32:44.188
BUT THE POINT IS JUST YOU
AND ME SPENDING SOME...

32:49.720 --> 32:54.373
OH, ZEEK.

32:54.420 --> 32:55.682
REALLY?

32:55.730 --> 33:01.077
YEAH.

33:01.110 --> 33:05.183
WELL, WE COULD STILL GO.
CAN'T WE?

33:05.220 --> 33:07.188
I MEAN,
AFTER YOU SEE LELAND,

33:07.220 --> 33:08.733
HE OKAYS YOU FOR YOUR TRAVEL,

33:08.770 --> 33:11.352
WE'LL JUST GO.

33:11.400 --> 33:13.800
I LIKE IT BETTER THIS WAY,
THAT IT'S NOT A SURPRISE.

33:13.850 --> 33:17.297
BECAUSE WE CAN LOOK FORWARD
TO IT TOGETHER.

33:17.340 --> 33:22.334
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

33:22.370 --> 33:24.065
YOU THINK IT'S CHANGED?

33:24.100 --> 33:26.716
NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, IT HASN'T CHANGED.

33:26.760 --> 33:27.749
HERE, YOU LOOK IT UP.

33:27.790 --> 33:29.417
THE LINK'S CALLED WES,

33:29.450 --> 33:32.487
AND THE B&B
IS CALLED CHEZ MARIE.

33:37.320 --> 33:39.356
[gaSPSJ

33:44.470 --> 33:47.359
[gasps] OH!

33:51.200 --> 33:52.747
OH!

33:52.780 --> 33:56.238
OH!

33:56.270 --> 33:59.068
OH, ZEEK!

34:19.570 --> 34:20.730
WANT A BEER?

34:20.780 --> 34:25.570
OH, NO. NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, I'M OKAY.

34:25.610 --> 34:29.432
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- YEAH.

34:29.480 --> 34:32.335
YOU HAVEN'T SAID A WORD
SINCE WE LEFT SCHOOL.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.856
YOU'RE HAPPY, RIGHT?

34:41.800 --> 34:44.177
I MEAN IN GENERAL,
YOU'RE GOOD?

34:44.220 --> 34:46.529
BECAUSE I--'CAUSE I GOT
A LOT OF BAGGAGE.

34:46.560 --> 34:49.427
I KNOW I GOT A--
GOT A LOT OF STUFF,

34:49.460 --> 34:52.145
BUT--AND I GOT
A DAUGHTER WHO'S--

34:52.190 --> 34:54.636
SOMETIMES SHE'S AN ANGEL,
SOMETIMES SHE'S NOT.

34:54.670 --> 34:57.912
I GOT AN EX-WIFE
WHO'S VERY VOLATILE,

34:57.950 --> 35:01.841
AND I'M WEIRD, AND...

35:01.890 --> 35:03.164
LOT OF STUFF.

35:03.200 --> 35:07.159
LOT OF STUFF, AND...

35:07.200 --> 35:09.236
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU...

35:09.270 --> 35:11.921
LIKE, YOUR LIFE
WOULD BE BETTER...

35:11.970 --> 35:15.929
OR JUST SIMPLER IF...

35:15.970 --> 35:20.418
IF YOU'D CHOSEN HIM?

35:20.460 --> 35:22.451
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
GOING BACK TO HIM.

35:22.490 --> 35:23.491
I KNOW THAT.
NOT NOW.

35:23.530 --> 35:25.873
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

35:25.910 --> 35:28.185
I'M JUST WONDERING.

35:28.220 --> 35:32.395
I GUESS I'M ASKING

35:32.440 --> 35:35.705
IS THIS REALLY WHERE
YOU WANT TO BE?

35:38.230 --> 35:39.504
SORRY, I'M SORRY.

35:39.550 --> 35:41.165
OH MY GOD,
NO, YOU JUST...

35:41.200 --> 35:42.827
EVERYTHING I SAY IS WRONG.

35:42.860 --> 35:44.475
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M
GOING THROUGH, YOU JUST DON'T!

35:44.520 --> 35:45.714
- RUBY! NO, I AM TRYING TO.
- NO!

35:45.760 --> 35:47.580
OH, MY GOD.

35:47.620 --> 35:51.386
SHE IS IMPOSSIBLE.

35:51.420 --> 35:52.762
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY,
I'M SORRY.

35:52.800 --> 35:54.688
I JUST--I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE TO GO.

35:54.730 --> 35:57.528
I'M SORRY.

35:57.560 --> 35:59.448

OKAY, LISTEN
WE'RE REALLY SORRY.

36:10.750 --> 36:13.924
SORRY ABOUT COMING
OVER UNANNOUNCED SO LATE.

36:13.960 --> 36:18.408
I JUST--WE WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
FOR NOT ADDRESSING

36:18.450 --> 36:19.929
YOUR DAUGHTER'S NEEDS SOONER

36:19.970 --> 36:23.417
AND REALLY TAKING THEM
TO HEART.

36:23.450 --> 36:24.678
WELL, THANK YOU FOR THAT.

36:24.730 --> 36:26.823
IT'S NICE TO HEAR.

36:26.870 --> 36:28.724
BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY

36:28.770 --> 36:31.625
MOST CONCERNED ABOUT
THE SITUATION WITH YOUR SON.

36:31.670 --> 36:32.978
WE'D LIKE TO KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO ABOUT THAT.

36:33.010 --> 36:35.877
WELL, ACTUALLY, HE WOULD LIKE
TO APOLOGIZE TO DYLAN.

36:35.910 --> 36:37.844
ONLY IF SHE WANTS TO MEET ME
OUT OF HER OWN FREE WILL.

36:37.880 --> 36:39.939
IF NOT, THEN I CAN JUST
APOLOGIZE TO THE TWO OF YOU.

36:45.370 --> 36:46.985
MAYBE...YOU SHOULD...GO.

36:47.030 --> 36:50.545
I'LL GO GET HER.

36:56.800 --> 36:59.928
WE'VE BEEN OUT OF TOWN
TRAVELING A LOT FOR WORK,

36:59.970 --> 37:04.725
SO THANK YOU FOR THOSE OCCASIONS
WHEN YOU HOSTED DYLAN, THANKS.

37:04.770 --> 37:05.794
- WOW...

37:05.840 --> 37:06.864
NO PROBLEM IT'S A PLEASURE.

37:06.910 --> 37:07.934
WE WATCHED MOVIES, WE COOKED,

37:07.980 --> 37:09.356
WE BAKED, WE HUNG OUT...

37:09.390 --> 37:10.948

37:10.980 --> 37:11.844
- THAT'S FUNNY.
- YEAH, CHOCOLATE CHIP AND...

37:11.880 --> 37:13.495
I HOPE YOU, YOU KNOW,

37:13.540 --> 37:15.019
DIDN'T GO CRAZY WITH THE SUGAR.
WE REALLY TRY TO LIMIT...

37:15.060 --> 37:16.812
NO, NO, NO,
KEPT A GOOD EYE ON THAT.

37:16.850 --> 37:18.909

37:18.960 --> 37:21.679
- HEY.
- HI.

37:21.720 --> 37:23.574
HELLO, DYLAN.

37:23.620 --> 37:27.021
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M
DEEPLY REPENTANT OF MY ACTIONS.

37:27.070 --> 37:28.924
I UNDERSTAND NOW THAT WHEN YOU
SAY YOU DON'T RECIPROCATE

37:28.970 --> 37:31.689
MY FEELINGS IT MEANS
THAT I NEED TO GIVE YOU SPACE.

37:31.730 --> 37:34.346
ALSO, IF YOU DO DECIDE
TO COME BACK TO CHAMBERS ACADEMY

37:34.390 --> 37:37.484
I PROMISE TO NEVER COME
NEAR YOU AGAIN IN ANY CAPACITY.

37:44.600 --> 37:46.488
WE'RE HOPING THAT YOU GUYS
WILL RECONSIDER

37:46.540 --> 37:49.600
AND STAY AT CHAMBERS.

37:56.370 --> 37:58.850
WELL, WE'RE NOT EXACTLY
CRAZY ABOUT THE IDEA

37:58.890 --> 38:01.950
OF CHANGING SCHOOLS IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE SCHOOL YEAR.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.649
IT'S SO DISRU PTIVE.

38:03.690 --> 38:08.104
- MM-HMM.

38:08.140 --> 38:11.837

ASPERGER'S.

38:21.980 --> 38:23.561
WHAT? DYLAN!

38:23.610 --> 38:24.770
I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD
HER SAY THAT BEFORE.

38:24.810 --> 38:26.607
- IT'S OKAY.
- IT'S FINE.

38:26.640 --> 38:29.086
ALTHOUGH SOME MAY TAKE OFFENSE
TO THAT, IN HER CASE

38:29.130 --> 38:30.984
IT IS A TERM OF ENDEARMENT,
AND SO I UNDERSTAND.

38:31.030 --> 38:32.782
I TAKE NO OFFENSE.

38:36.830 --> 38:39.469
[door closes]
OH, HEY.

38:39.520 --> 38:41.659

A LITTLE BIT OF BRIBERY,

38:45.660 --> 38:49.619
AND...OH, GOD.

38:49.670 --> 38:50.932
BY THE WAY SHE'S GOT,
LIKE, POSTERS ALL OVER HER ROOM.

38:50.980 --> 38:52.663
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE SHE GETS THEM FROM.

38:52.700 --> 38:55.737
SHE'S GOT, LIKE, THE HALF-NAKED
GUY FROM THAT WEREWOLF SHOW.

38:55.780 --> 38:57.395
WHAT IS THAT ABOUT?
I DIDN'T HAVE THAT.

38:57.430 --> 38:59.057
I HAD, LIKE, A POSTER OF--

38:59.090 --> 39:01.058
I HAD THE ROBOT

39:01.090 --> 39:03.570
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S HEALTHY.

39:03.610 --> 39:06.852
I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT OR NOT.

39:06.890 --> 39:11.850

FOR HAIR.

39:11.900 --> 39:13.060
