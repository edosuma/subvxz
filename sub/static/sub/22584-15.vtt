00:57.840 --> 01:00.354
It's been a long road

01:02.000 --> 01:04.355
Gettin' from there to here

01:06.000 --> 01:07.752
It's been a long time

01:08.560 --> 01:12.030
But my time is finally near

01:12.560 --> 01:15.870
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:16.720 --> 01:19.598
I will touch the sky

01:19.720 --> 01:23.110
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:23.280 --> 01:26.636
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:26.960 --> 01:30.873
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

01:31.320 --> 01:34.312
I'm going where my heart will take me

01:34.440 --> 01:38.319
I've got faith to believe

01:38.720 --> 01:41.678
I can do anything

01:41.800 --> 01:45.509
I've got strength of the soul

01:46.000 --> 01:49.072
And no one's gonna bend or break me

01:49.200 --> 01:52.954
I can reach any star

01:54.560 --> 01:57.074
I've got faith

01:58.240 --> 02:01.232
I've got faith

02:01.840 --> 02:05.515
Faith of the heart

02:15.680 --> 02:19.275
Captain's Starlog, November 27,2154.

02:20.040 --> 02:23.874
We've returned home for the official
launch of our sister ship, Columbia.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.278
On a personal note, I'll also be saying
goodbye to one hell of a Chief Engineer.

02:39.520 --> 02:40.589
Yeah?

02:46.080 --> 02:47.672
She's a thing of beauty.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.428
Columbia's virtually identical
to Enterprise.

02:50.640 --> 02:52.915
A good engineer
can see the differences.

02:55.600 --> 02:58.876
You coming to the Mess Hall later?
My going-away party?

03:00.280 --> 03:02.999
I don't understand the logic behind
this transfer.

03:03.120 --> 03:04.348
You're not being promoted--

03:04.480 --> 03:06.277
You think I'm doing this
to advance my career?

03:06.400 --> 03:09.073
You wouldn't leave Captain Archer
without sufficient reason.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.714
Well, for one thing,
this is a new challenge.

03:11.880 --> 03:13.711
It took me a year to
fine-tune Enterprise...

03:13.840 --> 03:16.832
I figure I can do the same
for Captain Hernandez in half the time.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.235
She needs a Chief Engineer
who's been out there...

03:19.360 --> 03:20.759
has the experience.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.592
Are you leaving because of me?

03:23.720 --> 03:26.029
Look, Starfleet's approved the transfer.

03:26.160 --> 03:28.037
You didn't answer my question.

03:29.440 --> 03:31.158
This may come as a shock...

03:31.680 --> 03:34.433
but not everything in my life
revolves around you.

03:50.080 --> 03:51.798
I'm glad we got here early.

03:51.920 --> 03:53.717
There never used to be a wait to get in.

03:53.840 --> 03:55.273
You didn't think Madame Chang's was...

03:55.400 --> 03:57.311
going to be your little secret forever,
did you?

03:57.440 --> 03:59.476
There are a lot of Starfleet people here.

03:59.600 --> 04:03.229
That's probably my fault.
I told a few friends about the place.

04:03.680 --> 04:05.591
-A few?
-I'm a Com Officer.

04:05.720 --> 04:09.349
If there's one thing I know how to do,
it's disseminate information.

04:09.560 --> 04:12.233
You didn't tell me how your meeting
went today, at the lME.

04:12.640 --> 04:15.279
They asked if I was interested in
becoming Director of Xenobiology.

04:15.400 --> 04:18.517
-That's great. Are you going to accept?
-I'm considering it.

04:18.640 --> 04:20.517
The truth is, I've grown rather fond of
my shipmates.

04:20.640 --> 04:22.517
I'm not certain I'm ready
to leave them just yet.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.074
-What would you suggest?
-I'm the wrong person to ask.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.919
I've got a vested interest
in keeping you around.

04:28.240 --> 04:31.232
-You, Denobulan. Come with us.
-What do you want?

04:31.520 --> 04:33.158
Maybe you didn't hear me.

05:02.840 --> 05:04.717
-Hoshi.
-I'm all right, sir.

05:04.880 --> 05:07.314
-Who did this?
-That's what I'm trying to determine.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.237
Commander Collins, Starfleet Security.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.032
Jonathan Archer.
This is Lieutenant Reed.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.230
There were three men.
They were in the shadows.

05:13.360 --> 05:14.634
I didn't get a good look at them.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.479
You told me before that one of them
said something to the others?

05:17.600 --> 05:21.195
Right before I passed out.
I'm pretty sure it wasn't English.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.151
Do you remember what he said?

05:24.840 --> 05:25.875
I'm sorry, sir.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.754
The only DNA we've recovered belongs
to Ensign Sato and to your Doctor.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.917
We did find some residual
ionisation traces here.

05:33.160 --> 05:34.752
A transporter signature?

05:35.520 --> 05:37.988
Very few people have access
to that kind of technology.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.350
Still, it's a likely explanation.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.271
Dr. Phlox was involved
in an altercation...

05:43.400 --> 05:45.470
the last time he was in San Francisco.

05:45.600 --> 05:46.828
You think this is related?

05:46.960 --> 05:49.076
Assaults against aliens are
still pretty rare.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.191
If the man who attacked him
was holding a grudge....

05:51.320 --> 05:52.435
He was a loudmouth in a bar.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.516
I doubt he could find his head
with both hands...

05:54.640 --> 05:56.278
never mind organise a kidnapping.

05:56.400 --> 06:00.234
We're pursuing all avenues.
Excuse me, Captain. Lieutenant.

06:02.720 --> 06:04.676
Check with Starfleet Operations.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.757
See if their satellites picked up any...

06:06.880 --> 06:08.950
transporter activity this evening.

06:22.560 --> 06:25.791
The dilithium matrix has got to be
aligned within 0.3 microns.

06:25.920 --> 06:27.478
The specs say 0.5.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.956
Who do you think wrote those specs?

06:30.080 --> 06:32.116
-A warp field specialist?
-Exactly.

06:32.680 --> 06:35.478
Some guy who's probably never been
outside the solar system.

06:35.600 --> 06:39.275
I've spent the last three and a half years
crawling inside one of these engines.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.789
-I know what I'm talking about.
-Aye, sir.

06:42.880 --> 06:46.111
Biggs, Pierce. I want you to recalibrate
the field stabilisers.

06:46.240 --> 06:49.277
Rivers and Strong,
start with the injector assembly.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.595
This bucket of bolts was supposed to
leave dry dock six months ago.

06:53.960 --> 06:55.313
I guarantee you...

06:55.680 --> 06:59.150
Columbia's going to warp out of orbit
before the end of the week.

06:59.360 --> 07:00.713
Let's get to work.

07:06.440 --> 07:08.954
It's customary to report to the Captain
after a transfer.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.149
I'm sorry, ma'am.

07:10.280 --> 07:13.556
I wanted to see what the situation
was like before we spoke.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.714
Commander Charles Tucker,
reporting for duty.

07:17.640 --> 07:20.438
-Welcome aboard. Trip, is it?
-That's right.

07:21.920 --> 07:24.388
So what do you think?
Can she be salvaged?

07:26.680 --> 07:28.636
I think there's a good chance.

07:29.920 --> 07:31.478
Any news on Dr. Phlox?

07:32.280 --> 07:35.033
Not so far.
If I hear anything, I'll let you know.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.630
You certainly know how to motivate
the troops.

07:38.760 --> 07:42.355
We'll be pulling triple shifts if we
want to meet this new launch date.

07:42.480 --> 07:43.993
You still need to eat.

07:44.800 --> 07:47.792
Captain's Mess. Tomorrow.
1800 hours?

07:48.120 --> 07:50.429
We can trade stories about
your former CO.

07:50.560 --> 07:51.754
I'll be there.

07:54.440 --> 07:55.634
Commander...

07:56.120 --> 07:59.032
drop by the Quartermaster's
at the end of your shift.

07:59.280 --> 08:00.269
Ma'am?

08:00.440 --> 08:01.714
Might want to...

08:03.320 --> 08:04.719
update your uniform.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.475
Aye, Captain.

08:18.360 --> 08:19.395
Come in.

08:20.080 --> 08:21.832
We've heard nothing from
the kidnappers...

08:21.960 --> 08:23.598
not even a ransom demand.

08:24.080 --> 08:26.469
I've spoken with the
Denobulan ambassador.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.871
He's notified the Doctor's wives.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.719
Hoshi thought she overheard
one of the kidnappers say something...

08:31.840 --> 08:35.116
in another language,
but she was semi-conscious at the time.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.716
Maybe you could help her remember.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.153
A mind-meld?

08:43.080 --> 08:45.150
I've never initiated a meld before.

08:45.440 --> 08:46.839
I don't have the proper training.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.552
I know it's dangerous...

08:49.200 --> 08:51.316
-but I can walk you through it.
-You?

08:52.160 --> 08:54.674
I had Surak's katra in my head
for four days.

08:55.480 --> 08:57.118
I picked up a few tricks.

09:00.560 --> 09:04.394
Computer. Access satellite logs 137.

09:05.120 --> 09:08.590
Time parameters,
1900 and 1945, today.

09:11.360 --> 09:12.395
What?

09:15.920 --> 09:19.754
Starfleet Operations, this is Lieutenant
Malcolm Reed aboard Enterprise.

09:22.160 --> 09:23.559
Please acknowledge.

09:24.720 --> 09:26.915
Burning the midnight oil, Lieutenant?

09:28.280 --> 09:29.315
Sir?

09:30.480 --> 09:32.710
I thought I was calling Starfleet Ops.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.308
Let me guess. You want to know
why the grid covering...

09:35.440 --> 09:38.034
San Francisco was down
for maintenance tonight.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.313
Something like that.

09:40.560 --> 09:42.232
Meet me at this address...

09:43.160 --> 09:44.309
in one hour.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.078
My mind to your mind.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.958
Our minds are merging.

10:08.440 --> 10:09.998
Our minds are one.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.479
Nothing's happening.

10:15.720 --> 10:19.030
T'Pol, try to relax your emotional
suppression just a little.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.878
I feel what you feel.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.873
I know what you know.

10:32.960 --> 10:36.032
-Can you hear me?
-Yes, perfectly.

10:37.160 --> 10:40.038
You and the Doctor have just
left the restaurant....

10:41.000 --> 10:42.956
I'm glad we got here early.

10:43.720 --> 10:46.075
There never used to be a wait to get in.

10:46.280 --> 10:47.315
Good.

10:47.440 --> 10:50.398
They asked if I was interested in
becoming Director of Xenobiology.

10:50.520 --> 10:52.750
-Where were you attacked?
-There.

10:52.960 --> 10:54.439
The truth is, I've grown rather fond--

10:54.560 --> 10:55.834
Do you see them?

10:57.200 --> 10:58.838
What would you suggest?

10:59.000 --> 10:59.989
Yes.

11:01.200 --> 11:04.158
-You, Denobulan. Come with us.
-What do you want?

11:04.280 --> 11:05.872
Maybe you didn't hear me.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.833
Focus on the moment.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.473
Put aside any pain.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.635
"Bring him with us." It's Rigelian.

11:38.280 --> 11:41.875
A Rigelian freighter left orbit two hours
after Phlox's abduction.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.231
According to their flight plan,
they were headed for Proxima Colony.

11:45.360 --> 11:48.670
This trajectory won't take them
anywhere near Proxima Colony.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.319
-Ensign.
-Sir?

11:53.600 --> 11:55.636
Put Admiral Gardner through
to my Ready Room.

11:55.760 --> 11:57.478
Shore leaves are cancelled.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.752
Get everyone back onboard.

12:15.720 --> 12:19.793
Am I to understand you are responsible
for taking that satellite grid off-line?

12:19.920 --> 12:21.273
Not me personally.

12:22.680 --> 12:24.113
But you're involved.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.879
Phlox is my friend.

12:29.560 --> 12:31.118
Do you know where he is?

12:32.240 --> 12:34.117
We have an assignment for you.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.992
I wasn't aware that
I was still a part of your section.

12:39.720 --> 12:42.234
There's a job
that needs doing, Lieutenant...

12:42.400 --> 12:45.358
and it may be the only way
to save your friend's life.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.630
Welcome to Qu'Vat Colony, Doctor.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.435
You will work with Dr. Antaak.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.437
I will do nothing of the kind.

13:23.360 --> 13:24.713
Then you will die.

13:26.520 --> 13:29.557
I'm certain there are easier ways for you
to recruit a new lab assistant.

13:29.680 --> 13:31.398
You misunderstand me, Doctor.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.511
Antaak will be assisting you.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.110
It's good to see you again, Doctor.

13:37.880 --> 13:40.519
-I beg your pardon?
-I wouldn't expect you to remember...

13:40.640 --> 13:44.918
but we met briefly five years ago,
at the lME conference on Tiburon.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.955
I don't recall meeting
a Klingon at that conference.

13:48.080 --> 13:51.038
I was disguised as a member
of the Mazarite delegation.

13:51.560 --> 13:53.232
My people weren't invited.

13:53.840 --> 13:55.990
I will let you two get reacquainted.

13:56.480 --> 13:59.278
I suggest you work quickly, Doctor.

13:59.600 --> 14:03.275
I expect a progress report by sunrise.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.515
You must forgive the General's conduct.

14:12.760 --> 14:16.150
The Warrior caste has little use
for social protocols.

14:18.600 --> 14:19.999
What do you want with me?

14:20.120 --> 14:24.113
The Empire is facing its greatest
threat since the Hur'q invasion.

14:24.920 --> 14:28.879
A virus is spreading from planet to
planet. Millions are already infected.

14:29.080 --> 14:32.709
If this continues,
the Klingon species will cease to exist.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.717
Why didn't you simply ask for our help?

14:35.840 --> 14:37.034
Starfleet and Denobula would have...

14:37.160 --> 14:39.116
provided you with all
of the specialists you'd need.

14:39.240 --> 14:41.515
You don't understand
the Klingon way, Doctor.

14:41.640 --> 14:45.315
To ask for assistance would make us
look weak in the eyes of our enemies.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.317
It could even incite rebellion.

14:47.840 --> 14:48.829
Why me?

14:49.040 --> 14:51.793
I was impressed by your lecture
at the conference.

14:52.320 --> 14:55.835
Your paper on viral propagation
was very insightful.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.430
What field of study
are you in, precisely?

15:00.560 --> 15:02.073
Metagenic research.

15:03.240 --> 15:05.196
I've already isolated the virus.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.117
I assume you'll want to start
by mapping the nucleotides?

15:11.040 --> 15:13.270
It wasn't my idea to abduct you.

15:13.920 --> 15:15.956
Nevertheless, you are here.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.154
Millions of lives are at risk.

15:32.960 --> 15:35.235
The freighter's warp trail
has terminated.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.396
They may have dropped to impulse.

15:40.160 --> 15:41.673
How long to intercept?

15:42.080 --> 15:44.799
At our current speed, 8.2 hours.

15:49.160 --> 15:50.673
Archer to Engineering.

15:58.760 --> 16:00.637
Commander Kelby, respond.

16:03.360 --> 16:04.349
Kelby here, sir.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.118
We could use a little more speed.

16:06.240 --> 16:08.390
The injectors are running at 105%.

16:08.520 --> 16:11.080
Commander Tucker's pushed them
higher than that before.

16:11.200 --> 16:13.156
I'll see what I can do, Captain.

16:29.480 --> 16:31.630
I don't know who's in charge of
your Mess Hall, but...

16:31.760 --> 16:34.399
he could give the chef on Enterprise
a run for his money.

16:34.520 --> 16:36.590
I stole him from the Republic.

16:37.320 --> 16:40.392
Captain Jennings said I could have
anything I wanted when I left...

16:40.520 --> 16:41.999
so I took his cook.

16:45.640 --> 16:49.189
I've gotten two transfer requests from
crewmen in your department.

16:49.800 --> 16:50.835
Who?

16:50.960 --> 16:53.554
It's probably better
if I didn't mention names.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.994
I denied them.
You're already short-handed.

16:58.240 --> 17:00.515
It's quite an impression
you've made, Commander.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.710
You've been aboard less than two days
and already...

17:02.840 --> 17:04.955
some of your team want to jump ship.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.476
I've knocked a few heads together...

17:07.599 --> 17:09.396
but we're getting the job done.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.954
We'll be ready for warp trials
by Thursday.

17:13.640 --> 17:16.029
I was surprised
you accepted this transfer.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.835
I saw an interview with you
after the Xindi mission.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.520
You said you couldn't see yourself
serving on any other starship.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.835
Well, you've got
a good memory, Captain.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.393
It comes in handy.

17:28.600 --> 17:31.433
I was getting a little too comfortable
on Enterprise.

17:31.560 --> 17:33.790
Got a lot of friends over there, but...

17:34.720 --> 17:38.269
sometimes it's easier to work with
people who are just colleagues.

18:03.880 --> 18:07.190
-Why are you here?
-I was about to ask you the same thing.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.594
-ls this a daydream?
-I'm meditating.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.477
This is where I go in my mind.

18:15.680 --> 18:19.229
Well, I would have thought you'd pick
a more interesting place.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.079
Like the beach, or...

18:24.200 --> 18:26.430
one of those Fire Plains
you showed me.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.549
Please leave.

18:31.520 --> 18:33.556
Exactly where am I supposed to go?

18:34.040 --> 18:35.109
Away.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.156
This is my daydream, you go away.

18:38.280 --> 18:39.554
Excuse me, Commander.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.716
-ls everything all right?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

18:41.840 --> 18:44.070
-The diagnostic you asked for.
-Thanks.

18:50.520 --> 18:53.353
Bridge to T'Pol.
We're approaching the coordinates.

18:58.720 --> 18:59.755
On my way.

19:09.280 --> 19:10.474
No bio-signs.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.316
I'm reading several bodies aboard.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.436
-ls one of them Denobulan?
-They're all Rigelian.

19:28.880 --> 19:30.552
Can you tell who did this?

19:35.240 --> 19:36.229
No, sir.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.876
I'll have to bring aboard some of
the debris and analyse it.

19:41.600 --> 19:44.717
Scan for their data recorder.
It might tell us something.

19:50.200 --> 19:53.909
Unless I'm mistaken, this virus is
a mutated form of the Levodian flu.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.918
It's immune to
whatever antiviral we've tried.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.553
We should contact the lME.

19:59.680 --> 20:02.717
They may have seen this mutation
before. I'm certain they'll be willing...

20:02.840 --> 20:04.512
to share their database with us.

20:04.640 --> 20:07.791
I know of a few indirect channels.

20:07.920 --> 20:09.319
No one would have to know.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.476
There's no reason to contact them.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.748
We've acquired their entire database.

20:19.840 --> 20:20.955
You stole it.

20:21.080 --> 20:24.356
Medical research isn't a priority
for the High Council.

20:24.480 --> 20:27.119
I am forced to obtain information
however I can.

20:27.240 --> 20:29.151
That doesn't sound very honourable.

20:29.280 --> 20:33.068
Given the choice between honour and
saving lives, I choose the latter.

20:33.200 --> 20:36.510
Perhaps you should ask your superiors
to steal a genome sequencer?

20:36.640 --> 20:40.599
We're not going to be able to map the
virus without the proper technology.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.070
-This man's been infected.
-Very observant.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.394
We're being exposed.

20:52.520 --> 20:54.238
This patient is at Stage 1.

20:54.360 --> 20:57.113
The virus doesn't become contagious
until Stage 3.

20:57.960 --> 21:00.155
When I asked you to bring me a
subject for dissection...

21:00.280 --> 21:01.508
I assumed he'd already be dead.

21:01.640 --> 21:03.437
He won't be alive much longer.

21:03.560 --> 21:06.233
-What do you think you're doing?
-Euthanising him.

21:06.360 --> 21:07.839
Out of the question.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.471
I thought you were committed to
saving lives.

21:10.600 --> 21:13.353
It is more honourable to give one's
life to medical research...

21:13.480 --> 21:15.038
than to die for no purpose.

21:15.160 --> 21:17.196
That choice is not ours to make.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.109
Proceed.

21:27.400 --> 21:30.233
Computer. Establish an
encrypted com-link.

21:31.360 --> 21:34.477
Starfleet frequency 79-Baker.

21:37.160 --> 21:38.195
Lieutenant.

21:38.320 --> 21:41.357
You told me the Klingons were going to
rendezvous with that freighter...

21:41.480 --> 21:43.835
-not destroy it.
-I regret what happened.

21:44.080 --> 21:45.593
But, they had to cover their tracks.

21:45.720 --> 21:48.871
-How many were onboard that ship?
-That's not your concern.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.468
Have you analysed
the weapon signatures yet?

21:51.960 --> 21:52.949
Yes.

21:53.960 --> 21:55.552
You haven't told Archer?

21:56.400 --> 21:59.517
I'm not certain how much longer
I can keep this from him.

22:00.040 --> 22:02.998
Orion raiders have been known to
operate in this area.

22:03.880 --> 22:05.757
You want me to lie again?

22:06.760 --> 22:09.274
I could explain the situation
to the Captain.

22:09.960 --> 22:12.076
You have a peculiar
sense of humour, Lieutenant.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.998
I've worked closely with the man.
You can trust him.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.712
Archer is a Starfleet Captain.

22:16.840 --> 22:20.037
His duty would be to report everything
you tell him to Admiral Gardner.

22:20.160 --> 22:22.230
They would launch an investigation.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.150
I'm being compromised, sir...

22:25.960 --> 22:27.359
and I don't like it.

22:27.960 --> 22:31.077
Then I suggest you adjust
your comfort level, Lieutenant.

22:31.240 --> 22:34.789
You made a commitment to us long
before you joined the Enterprise.

22:35.400 --> 22:37.550
Tactical Alert.
All hands to battle stations.

22:37.680 --> 22:40.240
- What was that?
-I believe we're under attack.

22:52.680 --> 22:54.272
Hull plating's holding.

22:54.440 --> 22:55.793
Still no response.

22:57.280 --> 22:58.759
Target their weapons.

23:12.920 --> 23:15.354
We've been boarded.
D-Deck, starboard side.

23:15.720 --> 23:18.109
-Access Tube 7.
-Seal it off.

23:18.320 --> 23:19.958
Get the MACOs down there.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.753
Disable that ship.
I don't want them getting away.

24:19.280 --> 24:21.396
They've activated their transporter.

24:22.080 --> 24:24.355
-They're going to warp.
-Pursuit course.

24:27.080 --> 24:28.752
The helm's not responding.

24:35.960 --> 24:37.234
Wake him up.

24:44.920 --> 24:46.433
Why did you attack us?

24:52.240 --> 24:54.470
"l have nothing to say to you, human."

24:55.360 --> 24:56.998
-That sounds like--
-Klingon.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.190
There must be some kind of mistake.

25:00.160 --> 25:01.195
What is it?

25:01.320 --> 25:03.880
According to his bio-signature,
he is Klingon.

25:15.560 --> 25:18.393
He must have been
surgically altered to look human.

25:21.040 --> 25:23.952
-Any theories?
-I need to run further tests.

25:24.080 --> 25:27.436
Their boarding party disabled our
anti-matter flow regulators.

25:28.640 --> 25:31.313
Warp drive should be repaired
in six hours.

25:33.160 --> 25:35.310
Give our new Chief Engineer a hand.

25:35.600 --> 25:38.398
Tell him to dig a little deeper
to see if these "Klingons"...

25:38.520 --> 25:40.238
damaged any other systems.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.878
The Rigelian freighter.

25:43.400 --> 25:45.630
Did you get anything
out of the black box?

25:45.760 --> 25:47.159
It's been erased.

25:47.520 --> 25:51.229
It might have been a safeguard,
in case it fell into the wrong hands.

25:52.600 --> 25:55.717
Work with Hoshi.
See if you can reconstruct any data.

26:08.680 --> 26:12.275
There is something familiar
about these base-pair sequences.

26:12.480 --> 26:13.595
Familiar?

26:18.200 --> 26:19.315
Boshar!

26:21.920 --> 26:24.229
Feeding time is over. Go back.

26:26.080 --> 26:28.913
Do you think it's wise to keep
wild animals in here?

26:29.200 --> 26:31.589
There are dozens
of creatures in your Sickbay.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.073
I don't let them roam free.

26:33.200 --> 26:36.749
I could never keep Boshar locked up.
He was my first patient.

26:37.120 --> 26:39.634
He tore his side open
when I was a child.

26:39.880 --> 26:41.871
I stitched the wound myself.

26:44.480 --> 26:46.550
I've seen these sequences before.

26:46.960 --> 26:50.191
Six months ago, to be precise.
This is Augment DNA.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.798
How did modified human genes
find their way into this virus?

26:54.920 --> 26:57.036
Is that really such a surprise, Doctor?

26:57.160 --> 27:00.232
It only took two human Augments to
commandeer a bird-of-prey...

27:00.360 --> 27:02.316
and murder its entire crew.

27:02.880 --> 27:06.793
The Empire could not allow an inferior
species to gain an advantage on us.

27:06.920 --> 27:09.753
Imagine, every Starfleet
vessel manned...

27:09.880 --> 27:12.235
with genetically-engineered humans.

27:12.400 --> 27:14.994
Earth banned genetic engineering
decades ago.

27:15.320 --> 27:18.232
The Augments who attacked you
were relics of another era.

27:18.360 --> 27:20.396
The Vulcans told that
to the High Council.

27:20.520 --> 27:22.192
They weren't very persuasive.

27:22.320 --> 27:23.958
We were simply responding to a threat.

27:24.080 --> 27:26.514
You were trying to create
Klingon Augments.

27:27.040 --> 27:30.510
But Soong's experiments were all killed.
Where did you get the genetic material?

27:30.640 --> 27:34.030
Several embryos were found in
the wreckage of the bird-of-prey.

27:35.200 --> 27:36.428
We used them...

27:36.560 --> 27:39.358
to re-sequence
a number of test subjects.

27:39.720 --> 27:42.678
There were some
unanticipated side effects.

27:42.840 --> 27:45.354
Their cranial ridges started to dissolve.

27:46.080 --> 27:49.038
Augment DNA was more aggressive
than you realised.

27:49.440 --> 27:52.113
For a time it appeared
we were quite successful.

27:52.240 --> 27:55.437
Our Augments might have looked
human, but they were Klingon.

27:55.560 --> 27:57.596
Stronger, more intelligent.

27:58.520 --> 28:02.433
Then, their neural pathways started to
degrade. They died in agony.

28:03.800 --> 28:07.031
One of the test subjects was suffering
from the Levodian flu.

28:07.160 --> 28:11.153
-The Augment genes modified the virus.
-lt became airborne.

28:12.360 --> 28:16.035
-You should have told me this earlier.
-lf you hope to ever leave this place...

28:16.160 --> 28:19.914
I suggest you stop asking questions
and resume work.

28:27.440 --> 28:28.475
What do you think?

28:28.600 --> 28:32.388
We may be able to reconstruct
the directory with a recursive algorithm.

28:32.560 --> 28:35.950
Is it unusual to have
weird dreams after a mind-meld?

28:37.440 --> 28:39.954
Subconscious thoughts
are often exchanged.

28:40.560 --> 28:42.676
They sometimes surface during sleep.

28:43.800 --> 28:47.315
I had a bizarre dream last night.
Commander Tucker was in it.

28:48.080 --> 28:50.355
We were in a strange place, it was...

28:50.960 --> 28:52.279
all white.

28:53.560 --> 28:55.391
There was almost a...

28:56.160 --> 28:57.593
romantic quality to it.

28:57.720 --> 29:01.030
I don't ever remember dreaming
about Commander Tucker before.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.319
Most unusual.

29:05.960 --> 29:08.520
The recorder was erased, deliberately.

29:08.960 --> 29:10.996
Malcolm said there might
have been a safeguard.

29:11.120 --> 29:13.998
The memory core was wiped
by that microdyne coupler.

29:15.960 --> 29:18.838
-You're sure?
-lt left a unique magnetic signature.

29:19.200 --> 29:21.794
We found it in storage locker C-14.

29:22.720 --> 29:25.917
The last person to access that locker
was Lieutenant Reed.

29:29.640 --> 29:32.234
I'm not quite sure
what you're getting at, sir.

29:32.960 --> 29:34.951
Only someone with security clearance...

29:35.080 --> 29:37.913
of Alpha-4 or higher
had access to the black box.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.237
That's just T'Pol, you and me.

29:40.720 --> 29:42.278
I agree. It is...

29:43.320 --> 29:44.753
a bit of a mystery.

29:46.480 --> 29:47.629
You're sure...

29:48.440 --> 29:51.000
that freighter was destroyed
by Orion weapons?

29:51.880 --> 29:53.279
There's no doubt.

29:56.480 --> 29:59.597
I asked T'Pol to double-check
your analysis.

30:05.680 --> 30:08.433
The freighter was fired on
by Klingon disruptors.

30:11.040 --> 30:12.837
With all due respect, sir...

30:13.200 --> 30:16.317
-it must have been a mistake.
-I've seen the sensor logs.

30:17.120 --> 30:19.315
Someone could have
tampered with them.

30:23.440 --> 30:25.829
I want to know what the hell is going on.

30:29.040 --> 30:30.792
Answer me, Lieutenant.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.633
Respectfully, sir...

30:35.600 --> 30:37.875
I refuse to answer any more questions.

30:42.840 --> 30:43.955
Malcolm...

30:45.000 --> 30:47.275
I never would have believed that you...

30:47.560 --> 30:49.073
of all people....

30:56.280 --> 30:57.269
Corporal.

30:59.040 --> 31:03.318
Lieutenant Reed's been relieved of duty.
Escort him to the Brig and confine him.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.275
We've set course for Klingon territory.

31:35.680 --> 31:38.194
We haven't picked up any
warp signatures yet.

31:38.680 --> 31:40.477
I may have to take this ship
into their space.

31:40.600 --> 31:43.034
I don't have to tell you
how dangerous that is.

31:43.160 --> 31:45.515
If you know where
they've taken Phlox....

31:46.440 --> 31:48.874
I have no idea
where the Doctor is, Captain.

31:49.720 --> 31:51.358
On that, you have my word.

31:51.480 --> 31:53.869
Your word isn't worth
a lot at the moment.

32:03.040 --> 32:05.554
The Malcolm Reed I know
would give his life...

32:05.960 --> 32:07.632
before committing treason.

32:08.120 --> 32:10.156
I'm not working for the Klingons.

32:11.720 --> 32:12.948
Who, then?

32:21.800 --> 32:24.633
You've betrayed everything
that uniform stands for.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.428
Captain...

32:29.800 --> 32:31.119
there are some...

32:32.320 --> 32:33.719
obligations...

32:34.760 --> 32:37.069
that go beyond my loyalty to you...

32:38.360 --> 32:39.793
and this crew.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.031
What the hell does that mean?

32:53.360 --> 32:56.716
-I can't say any more.
-You haven't said much of anything.

33:01.600 --> 33:03.875
You've told me a lot about your father.

33:04.520 --> 33:06.112
His years in the Royal Navy...

33:06.240 --> 33:08.470
their tradition of honour and service.

33:10.080 --> 33:13.914
How do you think he'll react when
he learns you're facing court-martial?

33:14.520 --> 33:15.999
I wouldn't know, sir.

33:35.840 --> 33:37.193
We're running out of time.

33:37.320 --> 33:39.993
I can't sequence
these nucleotides any faster.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.956
Perhaps you should have
abducted Dr. Soong.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.594
He could have mapped this genome
more efficiently than I can.

33:45.720 --> 33:47.517
We tried.
Soong was under heavy guard.

33:47.640 --> 33:51.315
If you don't accelerate your efforts,
there will be no one left to cure.

33:51.440 --> 33:53.954
The High Council
has dispatched the fleet.

33:54.160 --> 33:56.310
They have annihilated N'Vak Colony.

33:56.760 --> 33:59.877
N'Vak was one of the first planets
affected by the plague.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.592
They're massacring the victims?

34:01.720 --> 34:05.429
The Council will do whatever
is required to contain this outbreak.

34:06.320 --> 34:07.912
General, we are making progress, but...

34:08.040 --> 34:10.474
I'll need a few weeks
to develop an antiviral agent.

34:10.600 --> 34:11.828
It will have to be tested.

34:11.960 --> 34:16.033
Millions will be infected by then.
The Council will not wait.

34:16.480 --> 34:18.436
How long until the fleet reaches us?

34:18.560 --> 34:21.199
-Five days.
-I can't cure this in five days.

34:21.960 --> 34:25.270
They wouldn't destroy us if they knew
we had created Klingon Augments.

34:25.400 --> 34:28.995
-The experiment failed.
-lt succeeded for a brief period.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.630
If Phlox and I can find a way to
stabilise the human DNA...

34:32.760 --> 34:34.876
prior to the onset of Stage 3...

34:35.159 --> 34:37.071
our Augments would survive.

34:37.320 --> 34:40.391
If we're successful,
you could use them as leverage...

34:40.520 --> 34:43.795
force the High Council to
give us more time to find a cure.

34:44.159 --> 34:47.789
You don't seriously expect me
to help you create Klingon Augments?

34:47.920 --> 34:50.480
You could save
the inhabitants of this planet.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.399
I won't assist you.

34:58.720 --> 35:00.517
Kill me if you must.

35:01.920 --> 35:03.433
I refuse to cooperate.

35:04.560 --> 35:05.629
Take him.

35:19.040 --> 35:20.519
Hail the Dock Master.

35:25.920 --> 35:29.117
This is Captain Hernandez.
Request permission to depart.

35:29.400 --> 35:32.472
You're cleared for departure.
Smooth sailing, Columbia.

35:32.760 --> 35:33.795
Thank you.

35:35.560 --> 35:37.039
Bridge to Engineering.

35:37.160 --> 35:38.798
Are we ready, Mr. Tucker?

35:38.960 --> 35:41.394
Just a few more seconds. I hope.

35:41.960 --> 35:44.349
-Ensign.
-Dilithium matrix is stable.

35:44.480 --> 35:46.914
Driver coils are configured
for warp speed.

35:47.360 --> 35:48.509
Nice work.

35:49.120 --> 35:52.430
Engineering to Bridge.
We're ready whenever you are, Captain.

35:52.640 --> 35:54.119
Time to weigh anchor.

35:55.880 --> 35:56.995
Lieutenant...

35:57.360 --> 36:00.193
aft thrusters at one-half
until we clear Spacedock.

36:01.640 --> 36:03.517
Then take us to warp.

36:40.720 --> 36:42.312
So what are you in for?

36:42.560 --> 36:45.313
Is your Captain hoping
you'll obtain information from me?

36:45.440 --> 36:48.318
-I shouldn't think so.
-Why are you here?

36:50.000 --> 36:52.992
-That's a long story.
-Entertain me.

36:56.400 --> 36:57.549
I lied to him.

36:59.200 --> 37:01.031
You're fortunate to be alive.

37:01.360 --> 37:04.750
A Klingon who betrays his captain
would be immediately executed.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.155
Why did you and your men
board Enterprise?

37:19.640 --> 37:22.029
You know,
you may find this hard to believe, but...

37:22.160 --> 37:25.948
-you and I actually want the same thing.
-And what is that?

37:27.600 --> 37:28.715
A cure.

37:30.800 --> 37:32.597
There's no reason for you...

37:33.000 --> 37:34.991
or any more of your people to die.

37:38.400 --> 37:40.356
There's a malfunction
in the intermix chamber.

37:40.480 --> 37:41.799
Plasma pressure's rising.

37:41.920 --> 37:44.388
The anti-matter flow regulators
are locked open.

37:44.520 --> 37:46.988
-Did the Klingons damage them?
-Uncertain.

37:48.520 --> 37:51.830
-Pressure's approaching critical.
-Can we drop to impulse?

37:52.320 --> 37:53.833
The reactor would breach.

37:53.960 --> 37:56.554
But we can reduce pressure
by increasing speed.

37:57.320 --> 38:00.073
Go to maximum warp.
Get down to Engineering.

38:01.160 --> 38:02.593
See what you can do.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.518
You sabotaged us.

38:17.320 --> 38:19.117
How do we repair the damage?

38:21.720 --> 38:24.518
If our reactor breaches,
you're going to die with us.

38:24.640 --> 38:27.837
I'm a soldier of the Empire.
I'm prepared to die.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.912
Captain. You need your Tactical Officer.

38:33.960 --> 38:35.234
Please, sir.

38:37.840 --> 38:39.114
I can be useful.

38:56.880 --> 38:59.838
-Commander, did you see that?
-Please be more specific.

39:00.280 --> 39:01.429
On the monitor.

39:10.360 --> 39:12.669
-T'Pol to Captain Archer.
-Go ahead.

39:13.160 --> 39:15.390
The warp matrix
has been compromised...

39:15.920 --> 39:18.434
-by a Klingon subroutine.
-Can you remove it?

39:18.760 --> 39:21.797
I'm not certain.
It's infiltrated our command protocols.

39:24.920 --> 39:26.035
Do what you can.

39:30.640 --> 39:33.598
Bridge to Captain Archer.
Pressure's increasing again.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.552
Take us to warp 5.2.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.996
Sir, we can't hold that speed for long.

39:39.120 --> 39:42.271
We're out of options, Travis. 5.2.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.149
Acknowledged.
