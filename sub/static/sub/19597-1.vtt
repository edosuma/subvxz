Subbed by EhLaNa

00:04.800 --> 00:09.600
Jeff Dunham, I'm talking to you my man.
This is your night and this is your time.

00:09.700 --> 00:12.400
You're gonna put the smackdown on that crowd like 50 Cent.

00:13.800 --> 00:16.500
You're gonna get it crunk like Usher.

00:16.700 --> 00:17.800
Like the Ushers?

00:17.900 --> 00:20.000
Oh man, I gotta think white, think white...

00:20.100 --> 00:23.500
- You mean: going to do well like Toby Keith.
- Huh?

00:23.600 --> 00:26.300
- I think I get it.
- You're my man Jeff.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.400
Thanks Sweet Daddy.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Group hug?

00:31.100 --> 00:32.100
What???

00:34.100 --> 00:35.800
Uh...Ok Jeff.
You can put me down now...

00:35.900 --> 00:37.700
We got a show to do.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.800
They're waiting for ya.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.400
Ah...Shit

00:41.600 --> 00:45.300
JEFF DUNHAM:
"Arguing with Myself"

00:47.000 --> 00:50.600
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Jeff Dunham.

00:57.500 --> 00:59.000
Thank you!

00:59.800 --> 01:01.400
Thank you so much!

01:01.500 --> 01:02.800
Alright!

01:04.700 --> 01:05.900
Thank you

01:07.700 --> 01:10.500
You are assuming way to much,
ladies and gentlemen

01:11.400 --> 01:15.600
But thanks for coming out tonight.
I am happy to be in Orange County.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.800
I'm happy to be in Santa Ana.

01:17.900 --> 01:22.500
My mother-in-law had a dance studio.
She had this dance studio for 30 years.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.400
She owned it and she ran it.

01:24.500 --> 01:29.100
A few months ago, she was 4 days away
from closing the sail on the dance studio

01:29.200 --> 01:33.400
She was gonna take the money, retire,
be independent and live out the rest of her life.

01:33.700 --> 01:39.000
Then, the hurricanes came...
Guess where my mother-in-laws dance studio was?!

01:39.100 --> 01:41.400
West Palm Beach,
Florida.

01:41.500 --> 01:45.000
Guess who's living with me
and my family now in Los Angeles??!!

01:45.900 --> 01:49.400
I'll say it again: I am happy to be in Santa Ana.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.074

01:58.100 --> 02:00.700
Where is Chris Rock,
when you need the man?

02:00.800 --> 02:03.700
In one house, it's me,
my wife, three little girls

02:03.800 --> 02:06.400
..3 female dogs, 2 female rats
, 1 female fish

02:06.500 --> 02:10.300
Now my mother-in-law and
as a bonus, my sister-in-law.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.300
I am growing a uterus as we speak.

02:16.200 --> 02:19.100
The only other male in the household,
is my golden retriever: Bill.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.200
And they had him neutered.

02:22.900 --> 02:25.800
Oh, it's very sad. I came home
after being gone for about 5 days

02:25.900 --> 02:28.300
I walked in the front door.
Bill is lying on the coach.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.400
He looks up like:
"Dude...

02:31.800 --> 02:34.000
You're not going to believe
what they did to me...

02:35.100 --> 02:36.400
"Run!"

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Who is this?

02:40.500 --> 02:42.900
Ladies, meet me in the green room!!

02:43.000 --> 02:47.600
Well, our daughters are now 8, 10
and god forbid, 14 years of age.

02:47.700 --> 02:49.500
Thanks for your sympathy.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
My wife and I recognize that we are
living on the verge of hell.

02:54.400 --> 02:57.500
Because from what I understand,
when woman live in the same house,

02:57.600 --> 02:59.800
apparently, God has a sense of humor.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.700
Because eventually their biological time clocks synchronize

03:06.000 --> 03:08.400
So I know when all my daughters get to be that age,

03:08.500 --> 03:11.300
I'll be sitting on the phone with my agent
every 3 and a half weeks going:

03:11.400 --> 03:13.800
"You gotta get me the hell out of here!!"

03:17.800 --> 03:20.800
My office door will be locked and all I hear is:

03:22.600 --> 03:24.400
"Daddy...

03:25.900 --> 03:27.900
Let us in..."

03:28.600 --> 03:31.900
Bill will be sitting next to me:
"Don't open the door!"

03:43.100 --> 03:46.000
Well, I know that some of you know
what's going on this evening.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.000
I have little people in boxes and ahh...

03:48.100 --> 03:50.800
I gotta tell ya,
the way security is at the airports nowadays

03:50.900 --> 03:54.400
when you try and check in
with a small person in your luggage...

03:54.700 --> 03:56.500
They stop ya.

03:56.800 --> 04:00.800
Most airports nowadays have the sophisticated
equipment for checking your luggage

04:00.900 --> 04:04.400
They are like big MRIs,
they can check the contents, the materials...

04:04.500 --> 04:08.700
but some of the smaller airports, don't.
We all know Burbank airport,
just north of here a few miles.

04:08.800 --> 04:13.100
Don't have all the sophisticated stuff,
they still have to handcheck a lot of luggage.

04:13.600 --> 04:18.300
I was in line, about 3 1/2 weeks ago,
early one morning, very crowded

04:18.399 --> 04:22.400
And most people, when you get your
luggage handchecked, it's no big deal

04:22.500 --> 04:25.200
They might pull out your underwear, like uhw..

04:26.000 --> 04:28.700
But for me, they're pulling out dolls.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.200
I told him not to
do that joke.

04:31.300 --> 04:33.700
And I figured out the way they decide,
who's luggage they're gonna handcheck

04:33.800 --> 04:36.500
It is a complete judgement call
on these guys parts.

04:36.700 --> 04:41.700
They look at you and they decide and
apparently I look like a terrorist with a trunk.

04:43.100 --> 04:46.500
Because as:"Sir, I gotta take a look at that trunk".
I'm like: "Uh crap, here we go!"

04:46.600 --> 04:49.600
So he takes the big trunk and
he puts it on the top of the silver table

04:49.700 --> 04:54.000
He opens it up and the first thing he pulls out
is one of my little guys: Peanut.

04:54.100 --> 04:57.700
You'll see him in a little while,
you know my little Peanut.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.500
But he pulls Peanut out and he's like: "He."
and people in line are like: "Hey!"

05:03.600 --> 05:05.000
And I'm like "Ohh..."

05:06.000 --> 05:09.300
Now, they have these swabs and
they swab whatever it is they're looking at

05:09.400 --> 05:12.700
they then take the piece of material,
they put it in the analyzer

05:12.800 --> 05:15.900
it then checks to see if your stuff has come
into contact with anything dangerous.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.700
Chemicals or whatever.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.600
So the guy has Peanut in one hand,
swab in the other

05:20.700 --> 05:24.500
This is all true, it's too stupid to make up.

05:25.100 --> 05:28.900
He could have swabbed Peanut
on the head, on the foot...

05:29.000 --> 05:32.500
No, in front of God and everybody,
he swabs his butt, just like that.

05:37.600 --> 05:41.200
I know it's only a puppet...
But I work with the guy.

05:43.100 --> 05:45.300
There's a relationship here!

05:45.500 --> 05:49.500
And I'm sitting there watching this and
the first thing I find myself thinking is:

05:49.600 --> 05:51.600
You sick bastard!

05:53.100 --> 05:54.800
What the hell...?!

05:54.900 --> 05:57.300
Why are you wiping my friends butt?

05:58.200 --> 06:01.600
He then takes the swab,
puts it in the machine, shuts the door

06:01.700 --> 06:04.000
I think we're finished.
We start to put things away....

06:04.101 --> 06:05.001
Suddenly the little machine goes:

06:06.400 --> 06:08.800
Three more guys come out,
they have me up against the wall.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.300
they're checking my ID,
they're doing a background check on the internet.

06:11.400 --> 06:14.600
They're going through all my stuff,
takes 15 minutes.

06:14.700 --> 06:16.900
Now we're finished
Everything is fine.

06:17.100 --> 06:19.400
Then we start to put things back
and then I start to think...

06:19.500 --> 06:21.300
What the hell...

06:21.700 --> 06:24.600
was on Peanuts butt...

06:33.000 --> 06:35.300
that labelled me the potential terrorist?

06:36.600 --> 06:38.700
This is all true and I asked the guy
and he goes:

06:38.900 --> 06:40.700
Well, it's all in code on the computer.
Let's see.

06:40.800 --> 06:46.300
He goes: "Eh, that would be militairy grade
plastic explosives". And I go: "Hehehe.."

06:47.700 --> 06:48.700
"What???"

06:49.800 --> 06:53.500
And he goes: "Well, sometimes the machine confuses lotion for that..."

06:53.600 --> 06:57.400
And I went: "Haha!
No, there is no lotion on the puppets ass!"

07:04.500 --> 07:07.200
I've been building bombs in my garage.

07:08.700 --> 07:10.900
You caught me skippy!

07:11.600 --> 07:13.800
Thanks for
straightening me out!

07:14.000 --> 07:16.900
I don't ever want to go
through the Burbank airport again.

07:17.100 --> 07:20.700
There was only a small number of
these guys doing all the checking

07:20.800 --> 07:23.400
I know the next time I'll go through,
they'll all be standing in a group
and one of them will point and go:

07:23.600 --> 07:26.000
"There he is! There's the gay puppet bomber!"

07:26.800 --> 07:29.600
"There's lotion on his puppets ass"

07:31.000 --> 07:34.200
You two girls are twins right?

07:35.500 --> 07:37.500
Ladies and gentlemen, I have a few guys
to introduce to you tonight

07:37.600 --> 07:41.100
The first guy I met years ago
when I was still in college

07:41.400 --> 07:44.100
and he's a Vietnam war veteran

07:44.300 --> 07:46.100
And he was a welder at the time.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.100
He'd been married for many, many years

07:48.200 --> 07:51.300
And he was just tired of being in the house
and wanted to get out

07:51.400 --> 07:53.100
He saw what I did on weekends

07:53.200 --> 07:56.300
He thought it would be fun just to
get up in front of people and just talk

07:56.500 --> 07:58.900
give his point of views
on all kinds of subjects.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.400
So we tried it a few times,
I thought he was great

08:01.500 --> 08:05.000
We've been a team ever since.
Please help me welcome my old friend: Walter

08:24.800 --> 08:26.500
Shut the hell up!

08:30.200 --> 08:33.700
- Walter, you're happy to be here?
- Oh, overjoyed!

08:34.000 --> 08:37.400
Last week, I was lying on a beach in Mali
and I couldn't decide

08:37.500 --> 08:41.500
Should I stay in Hawai or go to friggin Santa Ana?

08:44.600 --> 08:47.000
My God, I can die happy now!

08:48.900 --> 08:51.700
- Fine city
- I don't give a damn

08:55.900 --> 08:57.500
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't know

08:57.600 --> 09:02.100
It's hot as hell outside,
my skin is a drie and itchy,

09:02.200 --> 09:04.400
You put me in a sweater

09:04.500 --> 09:07.500
Sure as hell, not gonna ask you for lotion.

09:19.500 --> 09:22.400
- You know you don't have to do this
- Yeah, I can get a real job

09:23.600 --> 09:26.600
- What would you do?
- I wanna be a greeter at Wal-Mart

09:37.900 --> 09:40.000
What the hell is so funny?!

09:41.200 --> 09:43.300
At Wal-Mart,
what would be your opening line?

09:44.100 --> 09:47.900
Welcome to Wal-Mart,
get your shit and get out!

09:57.000 --> 09:58.600
Have a nice day.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.400
- Anything else wrong?
- I don't know

10:02.600 --> 10:07.000
My wife and I couldn't find any place to park
anywhere near this stinkin joint

10:07.200 --> 10:11.500
And some jerk pulled up in a brand new mercedes,
goes right in the handicap spot.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.700
He gets out of the car and
there's nothing wrong with him.

10:13.801 --> 10:15.101
Don't you hate that?

10:16.300 --> 10:18.400
So I ran his ass over.

10:24.700 --> 10:27.300
I made an honest man out of him.

10:29.600 --> 10:34.000
And his mother got out the other side,
started swinging her crutches at me.

10:38.400 --> 10:41.300
Took her out with the door.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.800
- Don't you feel kinda bad?
- Oh hell, ain't carpool

10:46.400 --> 10:49.800
- Do you think the police didn't see ya?
- I ain't afraid of the cops around Santa Ana

10:49.900 --> 10:51.300
- You seen some of these guys?
- What?

10:51.400 --> 10:53.400
Cops on bicycles.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.600
- What's wrong with that?
- How intimidating is this:

10:55.800 --> 10:58.200
"Sorry buddy, pull it over"

11:05.700 --> 11:10.200
What do they do when they arrest somebody?
"Alright, in the basket"

11:12.700 --> 11:14.800
Yes ladies...
I wrote that joke.

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
Yeah, you can tell the rookie cops.
They got playing cards in their spokes.

11:20.501 --> 11:22.001
"Halt!"

11:31.500 --> 11:33.400
- So your wife's in town?
- Oh, yeah!

11:33.500 --> 11:36.000
- She's having a good time?
- She always has a good time

11:36.400 --> 11:38.300
Pisses me off

11:39.600 --> 11:41.500
- She's a lovely lady!
- She's gettin old

11:41.700 --> 11:44.700
Well, women age like fine wine

11:46.500 --> 11:49.300
She's aging like milk

11:54.600 --> 11:56.700
- Did you guys get into another argument this morning?
- Yeah

11:56.900 --> 11:57.900
- What happened?
- I don't know

11:58.000 --> 12:00.900
She rolled out of bed,
jumped on her minstrel cycle

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
and ran my ass over.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.600
Never heard it put quite that way before

12:11.200 --> 12:13.000
Oh it even has a sound.
It goes:

12:13.100 --> 12:18.600
<Nag, nag, bitch, bitch>

12:25.500 --> 12:29.700
- How long have you been married?
- Uh, what is it now? 46 years

12:29.800 --> 12:31.800
What was the happiest moment of your life?

12:31.900 --> 12:33.800
47 years ago

12:37.200 --> 12:39.600
- How long have you been married?
- 15 years

12:39.700 --> 12:41.700
You'll see

12:41.800 --> 12:43.700
- I'll see what?
- Remember when you said:

12:43.800 --> 12:45.700
- "Till death do us part"?
- Yeah

12:45.800 --> 12:48.800
Later, you'll realize
you're actually setting a goal.

12:58.200 --> 13:01.800
- Walter, what exactly is marriage to you?
- It's like drinking a slurpy

13:01.900 --> 13:04.900
First couple of sips are like:
"Boy, this is really good. I'm glad I did this"

13:05.000 --> 13:07.500
Then you keep drinking it,
goes right to your head and you go..

13:12.700 --> 13:14.900
"What the hell was I thinking?!"

13:16.100 --> 13:18.400
"Someone kill me please!"

13:18.800 --> 13:20.300
But eventually it stops hurting

13:20.400 --> 13:24.100
Yeah, but then you're stupid enough
to take another friggin sip.

13:25.100 --> 13:26.800
- Ain't the same anymore is it?
- What?

13:26.900 --> 13:29.600
Being married all these years.
You can't look at other women now.

13:29.700 --> 13:32.200
you can't talk to them,
you can't do nothing.

13:32.300 --> 13:34.800
- What are you talking about?
- I'll show you what I'm talking about...

13:34.900 --> 13:38.000
See this lovely young lady
sitting right here in the front row

13:38.100 --> 13:40.700
This gorgeous young thing?

13:40.800 --> 13:42.500
- Do you see her?
- Yeah...

13:42.600 --> 13:44.200
Oh well...

13:48.000 --> 13:51.700
Only thing you can do now
is run to the end of your chain and bark.

14:04.700 --> 14:07.300
Getting married is kind of
like buying a new car

14:07.400 --> 14:10.900
You know when you see that car in the
showroom floor just before you take it home...

14:11.000 --> 14:14.100
- Yeah..
- That is as good as it's ever gonna look

14:14.800 --> 14:19.900
Pretty soon, it will have dents and scratches.
Parts start to go bad.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.500
Then the new models comes out
and then you're like:...

14:24.800 --> 14:34.300
"Honey, can I just sit in it?"
No, remember?

14:40.700 --> 14:43.100
- Walter, how's the love life?
- You mean sex?

14:43.200 --> 14:45.200
- Yes
- I'm married, you morron!

14:46.600 --> 14:48.700
- I'm too old too
- You're not too old

14:48.800 --> 14:50.400
- How would you know?
- Well, I don't know, but I do know

14:50.500 --> 14:53.300
I had grandparents who well into their eighties,
where still having fun.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.200
Their eighties?
Good God...

14:56.300 --> 14:58.400
What the hell kinda sex is that?

14:59.300 --> 15:03.500
- "Was it good for you?"
- "I can't remember"

15:08.000 --> 15:12.100
- "We just finished!"
- "Who are you?"

15:14.400 --> 15:18.400
Are you trying to tell me there's nothing
sexually going on between you and your wife?

15:18.500 --> 15:21.200
It's very difficult.
She gripes about everything.

15:21.300 --> 15:22.700
Like what?

15:22.800 --> 15:25.300
She said I don't make
the right noises during sex

15:25.400 --> 15:28.200
- Sorry to hear that
- Wanna hear what I do?

15:28.300 --> 15:29.300
No

15:29.700 --> 15:32.300
- Alright, you talked me into it.
- Wait a minute...

15:32.600 --> 15:36.100
Now be careful,
these are gonna be kind of pornographic

15:37.300 --> 15:39.800
"Get off"

15:48.800 --> 15:52.300
"I can't see the weather channel!"

15:53.100 --> 15:55.800
"Get the hell off!"

15:55.400 --> 15:59.000
Oh, now that's funny!
Wait, no it's not.

16:00.100 --> 16:05.500
I know you know better than I do, but I mean
is there any kind of foreplay for you guys?

16:05.600 --> 16:07.300
Foreplay?
At our age?

16:07.400 --> 16:09.600
Yeah, it's come down to:
"Hey, wake up!"

16:13.800 --> 16:16.200
- You know what oral sex for us is?
- What?

16:16.300 --> 16:19.700
She screams: "Screw you!"
and I yell: "Bite me!"

16:26.200 --> 16:29.500
Come on Walter, at your age,
how do you keep things fresh in the bedroom?

16:29.600 --> 16:32.200
BRISE.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.500
I don't know. My wife and I heard
that coffee's good for your sex life

16:39.600 --> 16:41.000
Coffee?
Is it?

16:41.100 --> 16:45.500
No, it kept me awake
through the whole damn thing.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.900
I actually had to participate!

16:50.400 --> 16:52.500
Doctor said it's bad for my heart too.

16:52.600 --> 16:55.600
- Oh, the caffeine?
- No, seeing my wife naked

16:56.800 --> 16:59.800
- That's awful!
- Oh, you seen her too?

17:01.800 --> 17:03.700
So, is coffee good for the sex life or not?

17:03.800 --> 17:07.000
I don't know, but they're never gonna
let us go back into that Starbucks again!

17:11.599 --> 17:13.599
Well, we used the filter!

17:20.500 --> 17:24.400
You know Walter -despite how you act-, I bet when
you were younger you were quite a ladiesman

17:24.500 --> 17:26.900
I used to chase skirts all over the world.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.900
- Really?
- Till I got to Scotland...

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
and boy, was I surprised!

17:33.200 --> 17:36.000
- So you had women everywhere?
- I even dated a girl in India

17:36.100 --> 17:39.200
-  Really?
- Lovely young lady. Weird ass country.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.200
- What's wrong with India?
- I don't now

17:41.300 --> 17:44.200
Most of the women got a red dot
in the middle of their forehead.

17:44.300 --> 17:46.800
What the hell is that?
"You are here"

17:52.500 --> 17:55.500
Maybe it lights up
when the coffee is ready?

17:57.600 --> 17:59.000
Sorry

18:02.700 --> 18:06.400
- "Scratch it off, you friggin win something!!"
- Will you stop?!

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
How about this: "Hey looks like
she's videotaping me all the time!"

18:36.300 --> 18:39.800
As everybody was coming in tonight, they were
given an opportunity or two to ask you a question

18:39.900 --> 18:43.600
So before the show started, I grabbed a small handful.
I think you should answer them.

18:43.700 --> 18:45.200
I don't give a damn

18:46.100 --> 18:49.600
You pall here in the blue shirt, in the front row...
You filled one out?

18:49.700 --> 18:50.900
Hello!

18:53.400 --> 18:55.700
DID YOU FILL ONE OUT?

18:59.300 --> 19:01.500
Where are you going?!
Sit the hell down!

19:05.800 --> 19:08.000
You bastard, this is TV!

19:19.700 --> 19:21.500
What the hell?

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Think he's gonna take a piss?

19:28.900 --> 19:33.000
These are expensive tickets, extensive set-up,
lot of production

19:33.100 --> 19:37.500
Divide it all up, if he's gone for 3 minutes,
he's taking a 600 dollar piss!

19:42.100 --> 19:43.400
Dumbass.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Is he coming back?

19:54.000 --> 19:55.400
Ok

19:55.900 --> 19:57.400
We'll wait.

20:40.700 --> 20:42.900
- What's that guys first name?
- Mike!

20:43.000 --> 20:44.800
Mike.
Dumbass.

20:47.100 --> 20:50.000
- Are there speakers up in the bathroom?
- Yes

20:50.300 --> 20:51.300
Oh Mike!!

20:55.400 --> 20:57.900
Whe are waiting for you, Mike!!

20:59.600 --> 21:02.600
Kinda of tough to go
with all this pressure isn't it, Mike?!

21:05.600 --> 21:06.600
Mike!

21:08.200 --> 21:09.700
Get out!!

21:13.900 --> 21:16.100
Mike's taking a long time...

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Could be having trouble...

21:21.000 --> 21:22.800
What does Mike do for a living?

21:22.900 --> 21:24.400
Transportations

21:25.000 --> 21:27.100
He does transportation?

21:28.500 --> 21:30.500
What the hell does that mean?

21:32.100 --> 21:33.500
Medical transportation

21:33.600 --> 21:35.400
Medical transportation?!

21:35.600 --> 21:37.300
What the fuck is that?!

21:55.100 --> 21:57.300
Welcome back, dumbass!

22:00.300 --> 22:02.600
Mike, could you hear us in there?

22:03.300 --> 22:04.400
Mike!

22:05.500 --> 22:08.200
Somebody pull his string.
He's not talking.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.200
Mike, could you hear us in there?

22:17.000 --> 22:18.100
I could't hear it.

22:18.200 --> 22:22.400
Well, we could hear you.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.800
And you didn't wash your hands!

22:32.500 --> 22:34.100
I don't give a damn

22:35.300 --> 22:37.300
Back to you, asswhole.

22:43.500 --> 22:47.100
I'm sorry, just kiddin around.
What is your first name, here in the blue shirt?

22:47.200 --> 22:48.300
Nick.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.000
Nick, what do you do for a living?

22:51.100 --> 22:54.400
- I work in construction
- What kind of construction?

22:54.500 --> 22:57.400
- I work with a general contractor
- With a general contractor

22:57.500 --> 23:00.100
You're not the general contractor?
You work WITH one.

23:00.200 --> 23:04.600
- So what is your title, Nick?
- I guess you could consider it framing and drywalling.

23:05.100 --> 23:07.500
framing and drywalling...

23:09.200 --> 23:11.200
Got anything for that, dumbass?

23:15.900 --> 23:20.900
You know Nick, we got jokes for doctors
and lawyers and even trash collectors.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.500
But the framing and drywalling guy...

23:25.400 --> 23:28.000
Not in our arsenal of snatty come-backs!

23:40.100 --> 23:42.500
Now we're not gonna bother
going home and writing any

23:42.600 --> 23:44.600
cos hey...
what are the fucking odds now ?

23:47.500 --> 23:48.500
I'm sorry

23:51.600 --> 23:53.600
- It was Nick right?
- Yeah

23:54.300 --> 23:56.300
Nick and Mike.
Mike and Nick.

23:57.300 --> 23:58.600
Dumbasses.

24:00.800 --> 24:03.400
- Would you be nice to the crowd?
- I don't give a damn

24:07.400 --> 24:11.200
- Some of the folks signed these and some of them didn't
- I don't give a damn

24:11.700 --> 24:18.100
- Where is Valerie...? What is it?
- What is it... Ramney... Ramsey...

24:18.500 --> 24:21.200
- Valerie, where are ya?
- Right there

24:21.300 --> 24:25.300
"Dear Walter, how do you take
off ten years to look younger?"

24:25.400 --> 24:28.900
Oh, me? That would be Thompson's WaterSeal.

24:38.100 --> 24:41.900
This is from Milton: "Dear Walter,
my wife sits at home all day and won't work."

24:42.000 --> 24:44.300
"How can I get her to get a job?"

24:44.500 --> 24:46.800
Well Milton, you're going to have to die.

24:55.500 --> 24:57.500
That'll teach the bitch!

25:03.500 --> 25:05.900
- Where is Nick Manos?
- Right here!

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Nick!

25:11.700 --> 25:14.100
Nick says: "Dear Walter,
you're looking a little frustrated."

25:14.200 --> 25:16.600
"When is the last time you got laid?"

25:18.600 --> 25:21.400
Oh crap, I recognize him.
That's our gay stalker!

25:26.200 --> 25:28.500
I need medical transportation!

25:40.600 --> 25:44.600
This is from Steven: "Dear Walter,
could you please recommend a good proctologist?"

25:56.200 --> 25:59.700
Tony Whittier.
Oh, Tony from Whittier, California.

26:00.600 --> 26:03.200
- Pay attention, idiot
- I'm sorry

26:04.000 --> 26:07.900
"Dear Walter, time and time again
I have filled out this sheet, 6 times."

26:08.100 --> 26:11.700
"You never answer my question. What gives?"

26:11.900 --> 26:13.900
- Let's skip that one
- Ok

26:23.500 --> 26:26.500
This is from Chris,
it's a girl Chris

26:26.600 --> 26:28.400
"Dear..."
You read this

26:28.500 --> 26:35.100
"Dear Walter, after 9 1/2 years my boyfriend
still hasn't 'popped' the question"

26:35.400 --> 26:37.900
That says 'poop' the question!!

26:42.400 --> 26:44.800
Chris, you need to learn to spell I think

26:46.200 --> 26:48.900
How the hell do you 'poop' the question?

26:50.500 --> 26:53.800
I guess you should
listen from the other end...

27:00.900 --> 27:04.800
"Dear Walter, why don't chicken
breasts have nipples?"

27:10.000 --> 27:11.200
What?!

27:13.000 --> 27:16.600
I guess cos if they got too cold,
they'd poke a whole in the package.

27:27.400 --> 27:32.800
New from the Colonel:
"Chicken and Tits"

27:37.100 --> 27:40.200
"Dear Walter, what is one of Jeffs
deepest darkest secrets?"

27:40.300 --> 27:42.800
He has a sex blow up doll

27:43.400 --> 27:44.800
- No I don't
- Yes you do

27:44.900 --> 27:46.300
- No
- Yes and the sick part is...

27:46.400 --> 27:48.900
he makes her talk...

27:52.800 --> 27:56.400
- And boy, does she lie!
- Will you stop it!

27:58.800 --> 28:01.700
"Dear Walter, what was your
favorite toy as a child?"

28:01.800 --> 28:03.000
Dirt

28:04.400 --> 28:06.700
And we were happy

28:07.900 --> 28:13.100
Kids nowadays, they have too much.
They got the internet, videogames, computer crap.

28:13.200 --> 28:16.600
Hell they're even passing out condoms
in highschools, did you know that?

28:16.700 --> 28:18.600
- Yeah
- Good God

28:18.700 --> 28:22.700
When I was that age, we had to
walk 5 miles to get a condom

28:24.100 --> 28:26.000
Up hill.

28:26.100 --> 28:28.000
In the snow.

28:28.500 --> 28:31.000
- With a boner!
- Oh stop it!

28:41.600 --> 28:44.500
I threw this one away, cos
I thought it was kinda over the line

28:44.600 --> 28:46.900
but I think we crossed that
a couple of times

28:47.000 --> 28:47.900
- You read it
- Why?

28:48.000 --> 28:50.800
- I just can't. You read it.
- Ok, I don't care

28:51.100 --> 28:54.700
"Dear Walter, why is it that I
gag when I brush my tongue,

28:54.800 --> 28:58.100
but not when I give my boyfriend oral sex?"

29:02.600 --> 29:05.600
Well obviously, your toothbrush is bigger

29:08.200 --> 29:10.300
That's Walter! There we go! Alright!

29:21.200 --> 29:22.400
Thank you!

29:24.700 --> 29:26.600
Thank you so much

29:26.700 --> 29:28.700
And now ladies and gentlemen...

29:33.200 --> 29:35.600
Folks, every once in a while, a fear in showbusiness

29:35.701 --> 29:37.501
you feel the need to reinvent yourself.
Redo things.

29:37.600 --> 29:40.400
Make the creative juices keep flowing

29:40.500 --> 29:43.000
I felt not long ago,
it was time for me to do that

29:43.100 --> 29:45.700
so I fired my current manager
and hired a new one.

29:45.800 --> 29:49.500
He's actually here this evening and before I go
any further, he wanted to come out and say a few words

29:49.600 --> 29:51.800
We are getting to know eachother,
he's getting to know my audiences.

29:51.900 --> 29:56.000
I think you're really going to enjoy him,
because he's a smart guy. I really respect him.

29:56.100 --> 29:59.600
Please help me welcome
my new manager Sweet Daddy D.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.500
Well, it's about time.
These folks were waiting to see me...

30:19.700 --> 30:24.200
- How are you doing Sweet Daddy?
- Oh no, it's not Sweet Daddy, it's Sweet Daddy D.

30:30.700 --> 30:33.100
Well, I'm happy to call
you my new manager

30:33.200 --> 30:35.100
I'm what you call a player
in a management profession.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.200
Right.

30:36.600 --> 30:37.800
P.I.M.P.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.500
- You're a pimp?
- That makes you the hoe!

30:48.300 --> 30:50.200
- I'm not a whore
- What do you do for a living?

30:50.300 --> 30:51.900
- Make people laugh
- Make them feel good?

30:52.000 --> 30:54.900
- Right
- You're the hoe

30:55.600 --> 30:57.200
- That's not right
- Why do you do what you do?

30:57.300 --> 31:00.500
Why? Because I enjoy it and it's
the best way I know to make money

31:00.600 --> 31:02.600
You're the hoe!

31:02.700 --> 31:05.500
Wait a minute, what if I said
I only do it because of the money?

31:05.600 --> 31:09.600
You're the dumb hoe.

31:13.200 --> 31:15.400
So what ideas do
you have for my career?

31:15.500 --> 31:17.800
The first thing I gotta
do is school you in street

31:17.900 --> 31:19.100
- Street?
- Word

31:21.400 --> 31:23.300
- What?
- Word

31:24.400 --> 31:26.200
What word?

31:26.600 --> 31:27.800
What?

31:29.400 --> 31:31.700
- You said: "Word".
- Word

31:32.300 --> 31:34.700
- What word?
- Oh snap, what the hell?

31:36.100 --> 31:38.000
Dog, "word" is like:
"I heard that?"

31:38.100 --> 31:40.100
- Heard what?
- Oh shit

31:41.100 --> 31:43.800
Dog, you are not white.
You're neon white

31:46.200 --> 31:49.000
You're so white,
you make Barry Manilow look like a brother.

31:50.900 --> 31:53.000
- I like Barry Manilow.
- Are you gay?

31:53.100 --> 31:54.100
No

31:54.500 --> 31:56.500
I heard about the lotion.

32:02.600 --> 32:03.800
- I'm not gay
- You're just white.

32:03.900 --> 32:05.900
- Yeah
- It's all good

32:06.000 --> 32:10.000
- Look, do you think this is gonna work between us?
- Let's make an analogy here...

32:10.100 --> 32:11.800
If we were food...

32:11.900 --> 32:16.300
I would be a fine summer wine
that would be divine anytime

32:17.400 --> 32:25.200
- What about me?
- Every good wine needs a cracker!

32:25.700 --> 32:27.600
That's funny shit right there!

32:28.800 --> 32:31.000
You gotta laugh at that shit

32:36.400 --> 32:39.600
We got a fine hoochy
momma right here

32:40.900 --> 32:42.700
Hello??!!!

32:43.400 --> 32:46.600
You're looking to go home
with some real wood?

32:50.600 --> 32:53.000
You like it?!

32:53.100 --> 32:56.100
I may be short, but it
ain't my feet holding me up

33:02.900 --> 33:05.900
- Sweet Daddy, what are you doing?
- Trying to find me some hoes, dog!

33:06.800 --> 33:08.000
Hoes?

33:08.300 --> 33:10.500
Oh you mean women!
Oh I got it!

33:11.100 --> 33:12.300
Word!!!

33:13.800 --> 33:15.900
Don't you ever do that again!!

33:17.000 --> 33:20.300
I don't know what the hell that was, but
you just embarrassed the hell out of everybody

33:21.300 --> 33:24.500
Even the white folks are sitting there going:
"What the fuck was that?"

33:26.200 --> 33:28.400
You know us black folks got a saying

33:28.700 --> 33:30.600
- Stay black
- Right.

33:30.700 --> 33:32.300
- I got some advice for you
- What?

33:32.400 --> 33:34.100
Stay white

33:34.700 --> 33:38.900
I know a lot of white people
emulate the Afro-American culture

33:39.000 --> 33:42.700
- To make themselves seem cooler.
- Yeah, us black folks got a word for that...

33:42.800 --> 33:44.800
- What?
- Irritating

33:45.800 --> 33:49.200
So I'll say it again and it goes
for most everybody in this room

33:49.300 --> 33:51.800
I'll stay black,
You stay white.

33:52.200 --> 33:54.400
As for my Mexican
brothers and sisters...

33:54.500 --> 33:58.000
You learn English mothafuckers,
how bout that?

34:06.400 --> 34:08.500
That's funny shit right there!

34:10.699 --> 34:13.600
Oh Lord, I'm glad
I'm going home in a suitcase

34:15.600 --> 34:17.699
Look Sweet Daddy, who
are some of your other clients?

34:18.199 --> 34:19.900
- I can't tell you that...
- Why?

34:20.000 --> 34:22.199
- I gotta protect their anonymity
- Well...

34:22.300 --> 34:24.100
Give us a hint then.
How bout some initials?

34:24.199 --> 34:26.199
O.J.
Oh shit!

34:29.699 --> 34:32.600
- So you have some athletes and former athletes?
- Oh, sure enough

34:32.699 --> 34:34.100
- So you like sports?
- Oh yeah

34:34.199 --> 34:35.900
I like sports,
lets talk about sports

34:36.000 --> 34:39.500
What do you think about the
hockey strike we had not long ago?

34:39.800 --> 34:41.100
The what...?

34:47.699 --> 34:49.400
- You know, the hockey strike
- Oh yeah

34:49.500 --> 34:52.300
Me and all the brothers were laying
around the hood everyday going:

34:52.400 --> 34:55.400
"Oh Lord, what do we do with no hockey?!"

34:57.700 --> 35:00.400
"Thank the Lord, we got NASCAR!"

35:05.200 --> 35:08.200
NASCAR, that's another
dumbass crack of sport!

35:09.600 --> 35:12.500
- NASCAR is very popular
- I know that, I just don't get it!

35:12.600 --> 35:17.200
Lots of grown, white men going
500 miles, in a circle?!

35:18.400 --> 35:20.300
What the hell?!

35:20.400 --> 35:25.000
What kind of sleen half (?) is this:
"Look, they're making a left turn"

35:26.300 --> 35:28.500
"Oh, they're making another left turn"

35:29.300 --> 35:31.800
"Oh, they're making another left turn"

35:32.000 --> 35:35.400
I wonder what's gonna happen next???

35:36.600 --> 35:39.000
"Let's go to commercial, come back in 10 minutes,

35:39.100 --> 35:41.600
you ain't gonna miss a fuckin thing!"

35:50.000 --> 35:52.500
He is that the dude that Walter was talking to?

35:52.600 --> 35:53.300
Right there

35:53.400 --> 35:56.200
I was talking to him
outside before the show

35:56.300 --> 35:58.300
He was dissin me
on my threads

35:59.000 --> 36:01.200
- Oh, he didn't like your clothes
- That's right

36:01.300 --> 36:05.600
And he asks: "How come your name is Sweet
Daddy?" You know what I said to him?

36:05.700 --> 36:07.600
Ask your momma!!

36:10.300 --> 36:14.000
Don't get all up in my grill dog,
you know it ain't just me up here...

36:17.300 --> 36:20.300
And if I'm not funny,
it's not my fault

36:21.600 --> 36:24.000
- See dog, I'm kinda like coffee
- Coffee?

36:24.100 --> 36:29.800
Yeah, before you experience my brown goodness...
I gotta go through a big ass white filter.

36:35.900 --> 36:37.900
That's funny shit right there!

36:39.300 --> 36:42.300
- So Sweet Daddy, do you like the audience here?
- I love your crowd...

36:42.600 --> 36:45.800
But I feel a little bit outnumber...

36:46.900 --> 36:49.900
Is there one other brother
in the house tonight?

36:51.500 --> 36:54.500
Yo dog!
Run!

36:59.600 --> 37:03.100
Start up the car, I need you
out back after the show!

37:03.500 --> 37:06.300
It's like we're at a Dwight Yokum concert,
or some shit like that

37:08.200 --> 37:11.200
Look Sweet Daddy, before you go...
Why did you choose me as a client?

37:11.300 --> 37:12.800
- Because you're safe.
- I'm what?

37:12.900 --> 37:15.500
I gotta lot of clients ending up in jail and in trouble.
I don't see you putting your ass in jail anytime soon.

37:15.601 --> 37:18.501
<nothing>

37:19.000 --> 37:21.200
Unless of course,
they make lotion illegal...

37:25.600 --> 37:30.100
- Will you please drop the lotion?
- Ok, but I ain't picking it up anywhere near your ass!

37:31.200 --> 37:33.100
That's Sweet Daddy D!

37:40.300 --> 37:41.500
Thank you!

37:41.900 --> 37:45.500
And now ladies and gentlemen,
how do we describe this next guy?

37:45.600 --> 37:47.900
Pretty much just white, trash trailer park.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.200
Please help me welcome, Bubba J.

38:03.600 --> 38:06.700
- How are you doing Bubba J?
- I'm doing pretty good!

38:08.300 --> 38:11.700
- Well, I'm glad you're here
- Yeah, I was fixin' to coming here

38:11.800 --> 38:14.200
And I went out the
front door to come here

38:14.300 --> 38:16.200
And I came here,
and I got here

38:16.300 --> 38:18.200
And here I am!

38:23.600 --> 38:25.800
So Bubba J,
what does the J stand for?

38:26.400 --> 38:28.600
My last name is Junior.

38:30.400 --> 38:34.600
- It's a good thing they didn't name you Junior
- Yeah, that'll be dumb: Junior Junior.

38:35.500 --> 38:38.000
That's my brothers name.

38:39.900 --> 38:41.600
What have you been doing today?

38:41.700 --> 38:45.700
I've been watching NASCAR
and drinking beer!

38:48.000 --> 38:51.500
- That's your favorite sport
- Yeah, NASCAR is too!

38:55.600 --> 38:57.400
NASCAR is very hot right now.

38:57.500 --> 38:59.600
I know, everybody loves NASCAR!

38:59.700 --> 39:03.300
Well, Sweet Daddy says it's just
a bunch of guys driving in a circle.

39:03.400 --> 39:05.300
I know, that's my favorite part

39:05.400 --> 39:07.600
"They're making a left turn!"

39:10.000 --> 39:13.600
It's a sport that's easy
to follow when you're hammered.

39:17.100 --> 39:21.400
- I understand you got a new tattoo
- Yeah, I got another somewhere else...

39:21.500 --> 39:24.200
that'll grow...

39:27.700 --> 39:29.800
- Did you get it?
- They got it!

39:31.400 --> 39:35.500
I'm tired of hearing that most
NASCAR fans drink too much.

39:35.600 --> 39:38.000
- Cos it's not true?
- Oh no, it's true...

39:38.100 --> 39:40.600
I'm just tired of hearing it.

39:40.800 --> 39:43.800
Makes me thirsty for another beer

39:44.400 --> 39:48.900
- Besides beer, do you ever have wine at the track?
- Yeah, but we have boxed wine...

39:49.000 --> 39:51.600
Yeah, it's wine that comes in a box

39:51.700 --> 39:55.900
It's great, cos if you had too much to drink,
then you got something to throw up in.

39:59.200 --> 40:01.300
Bubba J, don't you
worry about your health?

40:01.400 --> 40:02.800
- Huh?
- Your health...

40:02.900 --> 40:04.700
- Like what?
- Your liver...

40:04.800 --> 40:05.900
No

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
My last abduction
with the aliens took it.

40:12.600 --> 40:16.600
- You think you got abducted by aliens?
- I don't think, I know!!!

40:16.700 --> 40:20.200
They took me and they
stuck something in my butt.

40:21.400 --> 40:26.000
And not in the good way...

40:36.600 --> 40:39.600
When you go to a NASCAR race
and you party a lot,

40:39.700 --> 40:42.200
who is your designated driver?

40:42.700 --> 40:44.800
What the fuck is that?

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
- Do you drive drunk?
- No officer!!

40:52.500 --> 40:54.300
I'm practising

40:57.600 --> 41:02.200
- Have you ever had an intervention?
- Yeah, and penicillin cleared her right of him

41:06.800 --> 41:08.900
Stupid cousin

41:11.900 --> 41:14.400
It was a second cousin!

41:15.600 --> 41:17.600
That's a grey area

41:19.000 --> 41:22.600
- Do you play any sports yourself?
- Does 'QUARTERS' count?

41:22.700 --> 41:23.800
No

41:24.700 --> 41:28.700
- Do you got a drinking problem?
- No, I pretty much got it figured out

41:30.800 --> 41:34.200
- What's your favorite beer?
- An open one

41:40.300 --> 41:44.000
- And how do you know when you had too much?
- I run out

41:48.100 --> 41:50.500
Have you ever been to an
Alcoholics Anonymous meeting?

41:50.600 --> 41:53.100
A.A. is for quiters

41:57.400 --> 42:02.200
He, Mister Dunham, I was wondering...
What is it that you do for a living?

42:02.300 --> 42:05.100
- I'm a comedian
- You are?

42:05.300 --> 42:08.900
- You got one of them catch frases?
- Well you know I'm a ventriloquist

42:09.600 --> 42:12.200
Oh, you don't eat meat?

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
What?

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
- Bubba J, are you married?
- Oh yeah

42:19.100 --> 42:21.000
- Is your wife pretty?
- Yeah...

42:21.100 --> 42:22.200
No

42:24.600 --> 42:27.100
- What's the difference?
- The light.

42:29.700 --> 42:33.000
- Where did you meet your wife?
- At the family reunion.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.100
What?!

42:39.600 --> 42:43.600
- Where was this family reunion?
- At the state fair.

42:44.300 --> 42:47.200
Why don't you tell us about
the first time you saw your wife?

42:47.300 --> 42:48.500
Alright

42:48.800 --> 42:50.600
There she was...

42:56.600 --> 42:58.400
- More?
- Yeah, more!

42:58.500 --> 43:02.300
- Where was she?
- She was leaning against the ferris wheel..

43:02.800 --> 43:05.000
Making it tilt...

43:08.200 --> 43:11.400
Sunlight, glistening off her curlers...

43:12.500 --> 43:16.800
Corndog in one hand,
a Budweiser in the other.

43:20.200 --> 43:22.200
My tattoo is growing!!

43:31.800 --> 43:35.400
I went up to her and I said:
"Young woman, you look more delicious

43:35.500 --> 43:39.100
then mayonnaise oozing
out of a spam sandwich."

43:41.800 --> 43:43.800
And then she smiled...

43:44.200 --> 43:46.500
What a tooth!

43:48.800 --> 43:51.400
- So I guess you dated her a little while?
- Yeah, a little bit

43:51.500 --> 43:55.000
- Then you proposed?
- No her daddy did that for me

43:55.800 --> 43:58.700
- How did that happen?
- I was supposed to come and pick her up about 7 o'clock

43:58.800 --> 44:01.000
One night, I got there at 7.30h

44:01.100 --> 44:04.500
And her daddy was on the front
porch with his shotgun. He said:

44:04.600 --> 44:07.900
"He Bubba J, guess who else is late!"

44:10.700 --> 44:14.400
I'm glad you're laughing,
somebody had to explain it to me.

44:17.300 --> 44:19.500
I still don't get it

44:20.200 --> 44:22.500
- So I guess you had the wedding at the church?
- Yeah

44:22.600 --> 44:25.200
- Had the reception?
- At Wal-Mart

44:27.000 --> 44:27.800
- Wal-Mart?
- Yeah

44:27.900 --> 44:30.800
- Why?
- Easier to return the gifts

44:31.600 --> 44:35.300
We walked in the front door, some old
conger standing there and he goes:

44:35.400 --> 44:38.900
He, welcome to Wal-Mart,
get you shit and get out!

44:40.300 --> 44:43.000
- Say goodnight Bubba J.
- Goodnight!

44:46.400 --> 44:49.800
I met this next guy many years ago,
also when I was in college.

44:49.900 --> 44:55.500
He is not from the United States.
He's from a small micronesian island in the South-Pacific.

44:55.600 --> 44:58.900
And he hopped a cruise ship,
I actually met him down in Florida.

44:59.000 --> 45:03.600
We met up, talked a little bit, I thought he was kinda funny.
We went on stage together a few times.

45:03.700 --> 45:08.100
He's been in my act ever since.
Please help me welcome my buddy: Peanut.

45:20.800 --> 45:22.400
- How are you doing Peanut?
- I'm doing pretty good. How are you?

45:22.500 --> 45:26.000
- I'm fine
- That's good, that's goood, that's gooood!

45:28.400 --> 45:30.500
- Well, looks like a pretty good crowd tonight
- You like it here?

45:30.600 --> 45:33.600
Oh, I love coming here to uh, uh, uh....

45:33.800 --> 45:35.800
This town right here!!

45:35.900 --> 45:36.400
- Which town?
- This one

45:36.500 --> 45:39.600
- Which is?
- The one we're in right now...

45:44.100 --> 45:46.100
Peanut, where are we?

45:46.500 --> 45:48.300
You don't know??

45:49.400 --> 45:51.200
- I don't think you know
- I forgot

45:51.300 --> 45:54.900
- You forgot?
- We go to see so damn many places, I forgot!

45:57.200 --> 46:00.100
- Think about it for a second
- Alright, alright, alright...

46:01.000 --> 46:02.500
Damn!!!

46:04.000 --> 46:07.400
- The drive from the valley
- Was bad as hell...

46:07.500 --> 46:09.800
- Traffic?
- Sucked like hell...

46:10.000 --> 46:12.100
- Drivers?
- Angry as hell...

46:12.200 --> 46:14.500
- And you?
- Were scared as hell...

46:15.400 --> 46:17.800
- Parking here?
- Sucked more like hell...

46:18.100 --> 46:20.100
- So?
- We're in hell!!

46:28.400 --> 46:30.700
And these are our hellmates!

46:31.600 --> 46:35.800
Think about it, next time somebody
tells you to go to hell: "Come right here!"

46:36.400 --> 46:38.600
- Where are we?
- I don't know!

46:39.200 --> 46:41.200
Help me out,
help me out!!

46:42.500 --> 46:44.000
Sorry

46:45.000 --> 46:47.600
- I wrote it down for you
- Oh good, you wrote it down!

46:47.700 --> 46:50.100
Ah yes! I love coming to...

46:50.200 --> 46:51.100
Sa.

46:51.200 --> 46:53.000
Nata A.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
Na.

47:02.500 --> 47:04.500
What the hell is that?!

47:05.400 --> 47:07.900
Sa Nata A Na.

47:10.700 --> 47:14.300
What is it a friggin Indian reservation?!
What the hell?!

47:15.500 --> 47:17.700
Sa Nata A Na.

47:27.500 --> 47:31.400
It's Santa Ana.
"Santa Ana".

47:33.700 --> 47:38.200
Look I know I didn't finish school,
but that friggin says: "Sa Nata A Na".

47:39.900 --> 47:41.500
Dumbass

47:49.900 --> 47:52.100
I will never blink

48:05.300 --> 48:08.800
- They pronounce it: "Santa Ana".
- Well, they're wrong!

48:09.700 --> 48:11.200
Sa Nata A Na.

48:18.600 --> 48:20.300
- It's Santa Ana!
- Are you sure?

48:20.400 --> 48:21.900
- Yeah
- Ok!

48:29.300 --> 48:31.200
- You're happy to be here?
- What?

48:31.300 --> 48:34.000
- You're happy to be here?
- Ohh, yes I am...

48:36.000 --> 48:39.400
Just last week, I was lying in bed
and I woke up sobbing.

48:39.500 --> 48:42.600
I will never be happy untill we return to...

48:42.700 --> 48:44.500
Sa Nata A Na!

48:51.600 --> 48:53.800
And now, we're here!!

48:54.700 --> 48:57.000
Thank you for bringing me!

48:58.400 --> 49:00.400
- It's a fine city
- Ok!

49:01.200 --> 49:03.200
- And we're in a very nice theater
- Ok!

49:04.500 --> 49:06.300
This town is great

49:10.300 --> 49:12.300
It's a fine city!

49:14.300 --> 49:16.500
Have you looked around?!

49:18.200 --> 49:20.200
Holy crap!

49:21.700 --> 49:23.600
It sucks!

49:28.600 --> 49:32.100
- A lot of history in this city.
- Translated: "Old as shit".

49:43.000 --> 49:45.600
They've been rejuvenating, refurbishing...

49:45.700 --> 49:48.200
Polish a turd,
it's still a turd

49:54.000 --> 49:56.200
- It's a fine city
- Ok!

49:57.200 --> 49:58.800
Sorry!

50:00.200 --> 50:02.400
- But the drive down here did suck
- Yes it did

50:04.400 --> 50:07.400
It was in the 4 or 5 then the 5, holy crap!

50:07.500 --> 50:12.000
Thank goodness we turned on the radio
and listened to the traffic report

50:12.100 --> 50:15.200
- How much good did that do us?
- None what so friggin ever!

50:16.400 --> 50:18.700
I hate the traffic reports.
They are a waste of time.

50:18.800 --> 50:23.200
Let me do the traffic reports,
I'll save everyone a lot of time and money.

50:23.300 --> 50:26.700
"He Peanut, it's eight o'clock in the morning,
there's a lot of traffic out there. What's going on?"

50:26.800 --> 50:29.800
"IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING!

50:31.000 --> 50:34.800
Everyone left the house
at the same damn time

50:43.200 --> 50:45.200
Back to you!

50:45.600 --> 50:49.100
Call me back at 5.30,
I'll tell you the same thing

50:49.400 --> 50:52.100
Only guess what?
THEY ARE GOING THE OTHER WAY!

51:04.800 --> 51:07.700
You know what else pissed me off today?
Try using my cell phone

51:07.800 --> 51:10.000
- Having trouble?
- Just like the stinkin commercials

51:10.100 --> 51:12.600
"Can you hear me know? How bout now?
Or now? Now?"

51:12.700 --> 51:17.000
You know what you don't hear in those commercials?
The other end of the conversation!

51:25.200 --> 51:27.800
What a piece of shit!

51:28.500 --> 51:32.500
You know what cellphone sex is?
"Can you feel me now? How bout now?"

51:36.000 --> 51:37.400
Stop it!

51:43.400 --> 51:47.900
This guy is not getting any of this. I've been
watching him the whole time and it's all going...

51:52.500 --> 51:54.500
I'm just kidding buddy.
What's your name?

51:54.700 --> 51:56.700
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

51:57.000 --> 51:59.200
I'm fucking looking right at ya!

52:02.900 --> 52:04.400
- Aren't I?
- I think so

52:05.500 --> 52:07.500
Fix my eyes asswhole

52:12.400 --> 52:15.300
It's hard to talk to somebody if
you're not looking right at them.

52:15.400 --> 52:19.900
It's like trying to talk to somebody who has a lazy eye.
You don't know which eye to focus on.

52:20.500 --> 52:27.000
You're sitting there talking to them thinking:
"Oh crap, should I be looking at that eye or that eye?"

52:32.600 --> 52:35.800
Focus you morron!

52:40.500 --> 52:41.600
What?!

52:42.800 --> 52:47.300
- What if someone here has a lazy eye?
- I'll confuse them. Here I am. Here!

52:54.600 --> 52:58.400
- You know what pesto is?
- Pesto is the stuff that goes on salades and pizza.

52:58.500 --> 53:01.500
No, Pesto. It's a magician with a harelip.
Pesto!

53:08.600 --> 53:11.300
- What if somebody here has a harelip?
- Sorry!

53:11.400 --> 53:12.600
Oh stop it!

53:13.700 --> 53:18.100
Boy, what if they had a harelip and a lazy eye. Their really gone be: "Fissed off"

53:24.300 --> 53:26.300
Back to you dude

53:27.300 --> 53:29.400
I'm kidding. You right here with
the blond hair and the glasses.

53:29.500 --> 53:31.500
- What is your first name?
- Terry.

53:31.700 --> 53:33.000
Terry!

53:33.900 --> 53:35.900
What do you do for a living, Terry?

53:36.500 --> 53:40.000
-  I'm a business analyst
- A business analyst

53:40.500 --> 53:42.000
Fascinating

53:44.100 --> 53:47.100
How the hell does that work?
Go to a business and go:

53:49.400 --> 53:51.200
"You are in business"

54:00.400 --> 54:04.000
- So where were we before this?
- Before this, we were in D.C.

54:04.400 --> 54:05.900
Ah yes, Washington D.C.

54:06.100 --> 54:09.200
Doing a show in a theater.
A lovely theater.

54:09.300 --> 54:11.200
About 5 minutes in the show,
I happen to look down.

54:11.300 --> 54:13.800
Back where you're sitting dude, there was a guy.
Sitting right there where you are,

54:13.900 --> 54:16.400
but he was facing THAT way.

54:16.500 --> 54:19.500
And everytime I said something,
the guy went:

54:20.600 --> 54:23.100
And I go: "Hey buddy, what are you doing?"
and the guy goes:

54:24.000 --> 54:26.900
It was a signer.
A SIG NER

54:27.600 --> 54:32.100
Think about this for a second...
They brought a bunch of deaf people to see a ventriloquist!

54:40.600 --> 54:41.800
WHAT?!

54:42.600 --> 54:47.100
What's do you do next? Go take on the
blind folks to see David Copperfield.

54:54.300 --> 54:56.300
"The elephant disappeared"

55:02.100 --> 55:04.600
"It just fucking disappeared"

55:06.300 --> 55:10.900
Oh my god, he's juggling now!
You should see...Oh, sorry!

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
What the hell were they thinking?

55:13.100 --> 55:18.200
And as the show went on, this guy started to piss me off.
I've never actually seen myself talk before:

55:18.700 --> 55:22.500
So now I thought: Ok I'm gonna get even with this guy
and suddenly in the middle of the show, I went:

55:22.600 --> 55:27.100
"He, stopsign, thank you, turn around, doing doing,
horseshoe, turtle, ughadigadigadiga."

55:29.700 --> 55:32.700
And this poor bastard
is just signing away

55:33.100 --> 55:35.100
All the deaf folks are like:

55:43.200 --> 55:45.500
"What the hell is going on?"

55:46.500 --> 55:48.500
"Our guy sucks"

55:49.700 --> 55:52.300
And then the really screwed thing...
The guy went:

55:57.600 --> 55:59.600
Off course, now he's just sitting there

56:02.700 --> 56:04.700
All deaf folks are like:

56:11.700 --> 56:13.500
"Come on!

56:13.800 --> 56:16.700
What are we missing?!"

56:18.700 --> 56:21.900
Sad part is...
This is all completely true.

56:23.400 --> 56:25.400
We're going to hell, aren't we!?

56:26.100 --> 56:29.100
Hop, here we are!

56:40.600 --> 56:43.100
Oh check it out!
Look, look, look, look

56:49.800 --> 56:52.000
- Are you ready?
- Si señor

56:52.700 --> 56:54.600
There's something the new folks don't know.
Tell them what you are...

56:54.700 --> 56:57.200
I am the jalapeño on the stick

57:01.200 --> 57:03.600
- That our jalapeño...on a stick

57:03.700 --> 57:06.000

- No señor. Mexicans are from Mexico

57:16.500 --> 57:18.100

57:18.200 --> 57:20.200

57:22.900 --> 57:25.600

57:42.100 --> 57:42.800
- Did you have a good day?
- Yeah

57:42.900 --> 57:45.600
- No.

57:45.700 --> 57:46.100
- A good day?
- Yes

57:46.200 --> 57:48.700

- I took him to the spa

57:54.100 --> 57:56.600
He put me in
the vegetable steamer

58:03.700 --> 58:05.400
It's the same thing!

58:06.400 --> 58:07.000
It's not the same thing!

58:07.100 --> 58:10.400
It is too. It gets hot
and it gets steamy and then it goes:

58:11.800 --> 58:13.700
Purple bastard!

58:14.800 --> 58:17.300
Mexican condiment

58:19.000 --> 58:21.200
- A condiment?
- I do not use them

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
- You don't?
- Neither did your mother

58:31.600 --> 58:35.100
Oh, that is funny shit right there!
That is funny shit!

58:41.800 --> 58:44.000
Wow! That was really good!

58:45.400 --> 58:46.500
You gotta work on it a little though

58:46.600 --> 58:48.000
- Why?
- Cos from here it sounded like

58:48.100 --> 58:51.400
it came out of my ass

58:53.900 --> 58:56.300
Now I have somewhere to put my stick

58:59.200 --> 59:01.800
Oh yeah?!
Well your mother is a corndog!

59:02.500 --> 59:04.100

59:06.200 --> 59:09.700
- Look José, are you happy?
- Sí, señor. I am happy

59:09.800 --> 59:11.800
What the hell is "GGGappy"?

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
- Are you always happy?
- I'm not happy on Halloween

59:18.100 --> 59:21.600
What the GGGell is wrong
with GGGalloween?

59:26.100 --> 59:28.700
There are no costumes on a stick

59:30.400 --> 59:32.400
You could be a fudgesicle

59:35.500 --> 59:37.000
- Did anything else happen today?
- No!

59:37.100 --> 59:39.300

59:40.700 --> 59:43.500

59:43.600 --> 59:45.800
He slam my stick in the door

59:50.500 --> 59:52.800
And now I have a sore stick

59:54.100 --> 59:56.100
Peanut did you apologize?

59:58.600 --> 01:00:00.000
- No.
- Why not?

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:02.600
Cos I couldn't breathe!

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:07.300
- Why couldn't you breathe?
- Because he was laughing too hard

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:16.600
Man, it was funny!
He looked like a hood ornament from taco bell!

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:21.200
- I think you just have to apologize.
- Alright, alright, alright

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:23.200
José, I'm sorry

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:24.800
It's ok

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:27.300
I hope you die

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.200
Look, you're just gonna
have to be nicer to him

01:00:29.201 --> 01:00:30.201
- Como estas usted?
- Muy bien

01:00:30.302 --> 01:00:32.702
- Quieres algo de beber
- Pues si, bueno

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:34.900
- What are you doing?
- I'm speaking to José in his native tongue

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.900
- Well, don't do that
- Why not?

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.500
Well... It makes me feel...
left out...

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:49.100
What?!

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:52.700
I don't speak Spanish

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.800
Picture if you will...

01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:08.100
Look José, you're an unusual kinda guy,
what makes you happiest in life?

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.400

- José, would you feel better in the box?
- It's most nicer in the box

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:25.500
Wow dude!
I thought you were gonna drop him...

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.100
That would have been funny as hell...

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:32.800
- Do not drop me señor
- I won't drop you, José

01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:35.900
I would be José Jalapeño...
on the floor

01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:40.100
Do a little tapdance
and we got salsa!

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:49.300
- That's terrible!
- Not with the right kind of chips it's not

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.600
- I'm sorry José.
- It's ok

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:53.700
I kick his ass later

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:58.100

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:00.500
I'll stir you with your own stick!

This is the way we stir the guac...
Stir the guac...Stir the guac...

Olé!

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.700
- I'm sorry José.
-  It's ok

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.600
Don't close the door

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:14.200
- Why not?
- The cockroaches

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:17.400
You have cockroaches in there?

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.000

- That's not right
- You're right. It'll be: Godzilla!

01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:22.400
Stop it!

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:25.500
- What is wrong with you?!

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.500
No.

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.300
- You didn't do crack.
- Well then you did

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:40.700
- No.
- Are you sure?

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:43.700
Come on...
It feels like one of us did...

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.100
- Did you do crack before the show?
- No.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.200
- During the show?
- No.

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:48.000
- After the show?
- No.

01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:48.800
- When?
- Never!

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:50.800
- What?!
- I've never done crack.

01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:51.900
- Are you sure?
- Yes

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
- Are you lying?
- No.

01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:54.700
- See how angry you are?
- Yeah

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.300
It's the crack!

01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:01.500
- There isn't any crack!
- Oh my God, he sold it all!

01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:04.900
Will you please explain to everyone,
I don't abuse drugs

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.300
Ok.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.000
- Come on, you gotta at least smoke weed?
- No.

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:11.600
- I don't smoke pot.
- Ever?

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.200
- No
- Never smoked pot?

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:14.900
- Never done drugs?
- No.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Then how the hell
did you come up with me?!

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.200
You're a sick man!

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.100
- Will you just tell them!
- Ok!

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:33.600
- Jeff does not abuse drugs
- Thank you

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:35.700
He's an alcoholic

01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:39.200
That would be funny as hell,
a drunk ventriloquist

01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:43.500
"Look, I can talk without moving my lips!"

01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:55.000
- You should get drunk and go to a strip joint
- Why?

01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:59.400
You would be throwing your voice
in places it should neeever come from

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.600
Some girl comes dancing up to the table
and everybody hears:

01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:07.900
"Let me out!

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:14.000
It's dark in here!

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:18.200
- No coins please!"
- Oh stop it!

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000
- You don't think that's funny?
- No.

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:22.200
- You're gay.
- No.

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:25.000
Gay, gay, gay!
You are gay!

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:28.700
- I have a wife and 3 kids!
- Oh! Good cover

01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.700
You know what the gay folks
need that they don't have?

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:35.100
- A superhero.
- A gay superhero?

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.700
Gayman!

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.700
"Hi!"

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:43.200
"Here I come to save the day!"

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.800
"And I look fabulous!"

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:48.900
And when he flies,
his butt whistles...

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:02.800
"Look it's Gayman!"

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:06.500
- "Don't turn your back on him!"
- Oh stop it!

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:09.200
Unless you have the lotion...

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:13.600
You guys, you've been a great audience!
Thanks so much for coming tonight!

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.500
- So Sweet Daddy, pretty good show huh?
- Yeah dog, whatever

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:43.400
- Let's count the till now
- Ok, but who are your friends?

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.200
My friends...yeah...

01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:47.900
This one here is the limo driver...

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.900
And the other one is the...

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.400
mechanic. In case the limo
breaks down on the way home.

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:55.500
Yeah, that's it!!
You are so fine

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:00.800

- Ok.

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.500
One for you,
one for me...

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:09.500
And then one for my lady friend and
then another one for my other lady right here.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.500
- Let's do it again now
- Are you sure?

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.100
This is all good,
this is all good!

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:17.200
One for you, one for me,
another for my ladies momma...

01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:19.201
That's you at least potentially...

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:22.100
And then two for my other lady
friend right there

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:24.701
Wait a minute, this is supposed
to be coming out of your share

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.700
That's what we're doing...
We're all sharing

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:29.700
It's all good, you're gonna be big!
Trust me dog!

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:31.600

Two for me...

01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:34.100
Three for my lady friend...

We're gonna have so much fun!
We are gonna party...

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:40.000
And then I'm gonna take my clothes off...

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.200
And then we're gonna do some more...

01:08:43.305 --> 01:08:49.345
