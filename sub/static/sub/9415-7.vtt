WEBVTT

00:07.003 --> 00:11.941
It was the fulfillment of a dream,
seeing something go from nothing.

00:11.942 --> 00:15.177
To this massive home that I built.

00:15.178 --> 00:17.998
[Distant footsteps]

00:19.455 --> 00:24.520
I woke up to the sound of
what I thought were footsteps.

00:24.521 --> 00:26.522
[Tin rattles]

00:26.523 --> 00:28.090
Who's there?

00:28.091 --> 00:29.724
[Glass shatters]

00:29.725 --> 00:32.194
- Something just grabbed the camera!
- [Gasps] Oh, my...

00:32.195 --> 00:37.535
Whatever it was, it was
right there in front of me.

00:38.168 --> 00:41.636
How could there be ghosts in
my house? It was brand new.

00:41.637 --> 00:42.971
[Gunshot]

00:42.972 --> 00:44.639
He's here.

00:44.640 --> 00:46.442
Who the hell is in this house with me?

00:46.443 --> 00:48.977
Is that you, Sharon?

01:15.805 --> 01:19.074
Back in 2002, I was working
as a private investigator.

01:19.075 --> 01:24.975
I was doing asset searches, skip
traces, and finding missing persons.

01:25.681 --> 01:27.829
But I was kind of tired
of trying to find out

01:27.830 --> 01:31.052
if husbands were cheating
on wives and stuff.

01:31.053 --> 01:36.825
I was suffering from tremendous burnout
and had to do something different.

01:36.826 --> 01:40.129
It'd always been my dream to
build a house with my father.

01:40.130 --> 01:42.027
See, my father was a builder,

01:42.028 --> 01:44.899
and ever since I was a child, he
had always been building houses.

01:44.900 --> 01:50.800
And the house that I was born and
raised in was a house that he had built.

01:52.242 --> 01:56.178
He found this lot in the
L.A. Times classified section.

01:56.179 --> 01:57.513
And he says...

01:57.514 --> 02:00.616
It's ridiculous, David. $40,000.

02:00.617 --> 02:02.978
And I was like, $40,000 for the lot?

02:02.979 --> 02:06.221
Where is this? In... in...
in the middle of nowhere?

02:06.222 --> 02:09.824
And he goes, no, it's
up in Beverly Hills.

02:09.824 --> 02:13.037
I was thinking, this
is impossible. $40,000?

02:13.038 --> 02:17.499
The lots in this area are a
half million dollars and more.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.334
$40,000?

02:19.335 --> 02:21.637
Believe it.

02:21.638 --> 02:25.340
He goes, here is the address...
dot, dot, dot, Cielo Drive.

02:25.341 --> 02:28.101
It's right here.

02:28.611 --> 02:29.878
Whoa.

02:29.879 --> 02:32.879
I said, this is it.

02:34.184 --> 02:36.151
You know, it's a great
area. It's up in the hills.

02:36.152 --> 02:39.396
It's like where I grew
up. It's very natural.

02:39.397 --> 02:43.091
So I fell in love with the place.

02:43.092 --> 02:48.992
At that point, my eyes drifted
down to the end of the driveway.

02:49.399 --> 02:55.299
And I'm thinking to myself, where
have I heard the name Cielo Drive from?

02:58.741 --> 03:02.477
But I was hell-bent on taking him up
on the offer and building this house.

03:02.478 --> 03:04.998
[Mellow music]

03:17.460 --> 03:22.147
It was the fulfillment of a dream
and seeing something go from nothing.

03:22.148 --> 03:24.700
To this massive home
that I built with him.

03:24.701 --> 03:26.901
There is just a sense of...

03:26.902 --> 03:29.662
Of accomplishment.

03:31.747 --> 03:34.309
I decided that I wanted to
have a housewarming party.

03:34.310 --> 03:37.846
<i>You're listening to W.K.D., Los
Angeles's very own golden oldies radio.</i>

03:37.847 --> 03:40.449
I liked to entertain, and I
liked to have friends come over.

03:40.450 --> 03:43.685
<i>So sit back, turn up the volume,
and don't touch that dial.</i>

04:03.072 --> 04:05.892
[Knocking on door]

04:06.015 --> 04:09.042
I hear a tap at the door.

04:09.043 --> 04:12.485
I'm not expecting
anybody for hours, and...

04:12.486 --> 04:15.306
[Knocking on door]

04:19.976 --> 04:22.797
[Knocking on door]

04:31.267 --> 04:34.507
There was no one there.

04:37.674 --> 04:42.010
And I go outside, and I
look up and down the drive.

04:42.011 --> 04:44.471
[Dog barking]

04:53.996 --> 04:57.726
And there's not a soul there.
There's not a car. It's vacant.

04:57.727 --> 05:00.487
It's dead empty.

05:02.332 --> 05:04.232
[Upbeat music playing]

05:04.233 --> 05:06.134
[Crowd chattering, laughing]

05:06.135 --> 05:10.595
There must've been about 50 to 60
people hanging out and partying.

05:10.596 --> 05:13.290
Having drinks and whatnot.

05:13.291 --> 05:16.111
[Knocking on door]

05:16.178 --> 05:18.413
- Hey!
- Hey! How are you?

05:18.414 --> 05:20.014
- So good to see you!
- Good to see you.

05:20.015 --> 05:21.450
Kiss, kiss, mm.

05:21.451 --> 05:24.219
It was this great party, great people.

05:24.220 --> 05:26.827
You know, I always say
that you can judge people

05:26.828 --> 05:29.257
by their friends, by
the company they keep.

05:29.258 --> 05:32.361
And... and this was just
a great bunch of people.

05:32.362 --> 05:34.496
[Laughter]

05:34.497 --> 05:37.098
The house was beautiful,
and I was impressed.

05:37.099 --> 05:39.368
I can't believe he built it, you know.

05:39.369 --> 05:43.869
- This house is amazing.
- Thanks, thanks.

05:45.207 --> 05:49.644
He has an open door policy that just
makes you feel welcome when you come in.

05:49.645 --> 05:55.545
I think he has a saying that says,
come as strangers. Leave as friends.

05:57.720 --> 05:59.988
At one point I went into the kitchen.

05:59.989 --> 06:03.289
[Electronic music playing]

06:19.442 --> 06:21.610
[Voices whisper distantly]

06:21.611 --> 06:25.811
Something kind of caught my attention.

06:31.487 --> 06:35.223
But I didn't quite see who it was. I
just saw that it was a man with dark hair.

06:35.224 --> 06:38.393
And I was trying to think... you know,
I know a lot of people up at this party.

06:38.394 --> 06:43.434
I should know who that
was that was walking by.

06:49.238 --> 06:53.978
But it's not making
any sense in my brain.

06:54.911 --> 07:00.104
This window sits about 20
or 30 feet off the ground.

07:00.105 --> 07:06.005
It's absolutely impossible for
somebody to have walked by that window.

07:16.332 --> 07:19.356
Later that night, I mean, we were
all upstairs hanging out and partying,

07:19.357 --> 07:23.137
Jeff was over near the kitchen.

07:26.590 --> 07:29.230
[Glass shatters]

07:32.200 --> 07:37.240
The glass of wine just
came flying off the bar.

07:37.735 --> 07:40.615
I saw it fly out.

07:44.864 --> 07:50.764
And there was nothing there.
There was no one in the kitchen.

07:53.393 --> 07:55.871
It was troubling at first...

07:55.872 --> 07:59.412
Concerning to say the least.

08:03.846 --> 08:06.455
<i>But out here in the
vast pacific ocean...</i>

08:06.456 --> 08:10.887
I met David through a friend,
and when I first met him, I...

08:10.888 --> 08:12.821
Was kind of entranced by him.

08:12.822 --> 08:13.884
I'm getting tired.

08:13.885 --> 08:15.208
<i>The largest of the turtle family.</i>

08:15.209 --> 08:17.559
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I think I'm gonna go up.

08:17.560 --> 08:21.129
I mean, he was good looking
and bigger than life, I guess.

08:21.130 --> 08:22.630
You gonna come up?

08:22.631 --> 08:24.328
No, I'm gonna watch the turtles.

08:24.329 --> 08:27.060
<i>With few natural predators...</i>

08:27.061 --> 08:30.805
- I'll see you up there.
- Okay, good night.

08:30.806 --> 08:34.009
I decided to go to bed a little early.
I had to be up early the next day.

08:34.010 --> 08:36.590
[Water running]

08:40.917 --> 08:43.496
[Clock ticking]

<i>Over the last ten years, its natural
environment has been slowly decreased.</i>

09:06.141 --> 09:09.770
A little later on that night,
I was drifting in and out,

09:09.771 --> 09:14.031
you know, at that almost asleep state.

09:17.787 --> 09:20.247
[Door creaks]

09:20.957 --> 09:24.137
I heard the door open.

09:33.903 --> 09:37.143
I assumed it was David.

09:37.940 --> 09:39.920
David?

09:39.942 --> 09:44.742
And he didn't say
anything, which was weird.

09:54.256 --> 09:57.496
Someone was right there.

09:59.192 --> 10:03.032
And then... they... it was gone.

10:03.245 --> 10:06.245
It was really scary.

10:10.272 --> 10:12.674
Were you just upstairs?

10:12.675 --> 10:14.109
Were you just upstairs?

10:14.110 --> 10:15.576
No, why?

10:15.577 --> 10:18.172
I saw something or someone.

10:18.173 --> 10:20.656
- I don't know what to make of it.
- Come on, sit down. Where?

10:20.657 --> 10:23.970
There's something happening here,
and I'm not so sure I know what it is.

10:23.971 --> 10:25.620
There was nothing there.

10:25.621 --> 10:28.923
He seemed very affected
by what I was telling him.

10:28.924 --> 10:31.624
It bothered him.

10:34.429 --> 10:37.866
Being an ex P.I., this was important
for me to understand what was going on.

10:37.867 --> 10:39.328
This wasn't a job.

10:39.329 --> 10:44.438
This was something... as the old
saying goes, it was something personal.

10:44.439 --> 10:49.779
I had to figure out what
was going on in my house.

10:51.446 --> 10:53.247
So I did some investigating.

10:53.248 --> 10:56.389
I started digging through
the old newspaper articles

10:56.390 --> 11:01.455
to see if there's anything
that might give me an answer.

11:01.456 --> 11:07.356
I'm having to read through
articles about murders and whatnot.

11:09.999 --> 11:15.899
And then I came across one article
that caught me totally by surprise.

11:20.810 --> 11:24.350
And then it dawned upon me.

11:26.182 --> 11:30.344
Cielo Drive was, in fact, the
location and the name of the street...

11:30.345 --> 11:36.245
Where the Charles Manson murders had
taken place some 30 years earlier.

11:41.139 --> 11:47.039
I realized I was living near where
these terrible murders had taken place.

11:48.670 --> 11:51.773
But why would the Manson murders
have anything to do with my house?

11:51.774 --> 11:55.509
I mean, I'm four houses down the street
from where the murders took place.

11:55.510 --> 11:58.012
The house was torn down in 1992.

11:58.013 --> 11:59.499
My house is brand-new.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.753
There's no physical
connection between where

12:01.754 --> 12:06.014
these murders took place and my house.

12:18.427 --> 12:20.760
That evening I invited
my friend Jeff and Kashmir

12:20.761 --> 12:23.447
to come over to watch a
movie in the theater room.

12:23.448 --> 12:26.628
[Majestic music playing]

12:27.576 --> 12:29.431
It turned out to be Planet of The Apes,

12:29.432 --> 12:32.065
which I've seen a million
times, but it doesn't matter.

12:32.066 --> 12:37.966
Just seeing it in somebody's home on the
screen sitting in a couch, it's wonderful.

12:42.424 --> 12:45.844
[Voices murmuring distantly]

12:50.299 --> 12:53.501
We heard these voices
coming from the intercom.

12:53.502 --> 12:56.442
[Murmuring continues]

13:19.628 --> 13:22.328
Is anyone there?

13:22.331 --> 13:24.542
David goes up to the...

13:24.543 --> 13:30.443
To the intercom to answer them,
but they're not talking back to him.

13:32.007 --> 13:37.047
It was just this... this
quiet, constant talking.

13:37.079 --> 13:40.715
I couldn't make out what they were
saying, they were just sort of talking...

13:40.716 --> 13:43.017
To themselves, it sounded
like more than one person.

13:43.018 --> 13:44.819
[Murmuring continues]

13:44.820 --> 13:47.956
The intercom system
works through the house.

13:47.957 --> 13:50.417
Who's there?

13:50.525 --> 13:55.265
You have to be inside
the house to use it.

13:59.935 --> 14:04.315
So whoever it was was inside the house.

14:14.255 --> 14:15.611
[Voices murmuring over intercom]

14:15.612 --> 14:20.652
You guys stay here. I'm
gonna go check it out.

14:34.999 --> 14:38.401
I slowly crept up the staircase.

14:38.402 --> 14:41.162
[Voices murmuring]

14:44.141 --> 14:47.778
I'm looking for somebody. I don't know
who it is, I don't know what it is...

14:47.779 --> 14:53.679
But there's somebody in this house, and
I'm scared to death, to be honest with you.

15:16.807 --> 15:21.907
I'm hearing voices and
footsteps inside the room.

15:24.206 --> 15:29.066
I grab my rifle, my
little .22 caliber rifle.

15:40.398 --> 15:42.858
[Voices stop]

15:43.605 --> 15:46.725
There's no one there.

15:50.524 --> 15:53.776
David was still upstairs...

15:53.777 --> 15:57.497
[Voices murmuring over intercom]

16:00.643 --> 16:03.954
And the talking continued.

16:03.955 --> 16:09.855
But it didn't just continue, it
moved out, away from the intercom...

16:10.995 --> 16:13.763
And started moving into the room.

16:13.764 --> 16:17.484
[Supernatural voices crying out]

16:18.336 --> 16:23.016
There was anguish and
terror in the voices.

16:23.140 --> 16:24.975
Who could be talking?

16:24.976 --> 16:27.376
What is it?

16:28.912 --> 16:32.152
And then it disappeared.

- Oh, my God.

16:50.468 --> 16:51.934
No, David.

16:51.935 --> 16:53.425
You missed it.

16:53.426 --> 16:54.457
What?

16:54.458 --> 16:57.484
There's no one in this
house. This house is empty.

16:57.485 --> 17:00.287
- There's no way. There's no way.
- Let me go check it out.

17:00.288 --> 17:01.894
- You stay here with Kashmir.
- Sure.

17:01.895 --> 17:07.795
The voices were so loud, and it was
like he was in the room, right here.

17:07.992 --> 17:11.593
I'm walking up the stairs...

17:11.989 --> 17:16.069
And I make it to the second floor.

17:17.461 --> 17:21.121
[Static-filled radio broadcast]

17:22.776 --> 17:25.836
And I hear something.

17:26.569 --> 17:31.341
And it sounded like somebody
switched the radio on.

17:31.342 --> 17:34.029
And then there's this
raspy... [breathing deeply]

17:34.030 --> 17:39.430
You know, very labored
breathing, like a death rattle.

17:39.848 --> 17:43.086
[Tin clinking, woman screaming]

I feel this blast of air, and
it just comes rushing at me.

[Music stops]

17:52.129 --> 17:58.029
The thing goes right over my head
and heads up to the top floor.

18:00.071 --> 18:04.147
Everything that's going on now
around me challenges everything

18:04.148 --> 18:06.909
that I ever believed or
didn't want to believe.

18:06.910 --> 18:08.729
Uh, and...

18:08.730 --> 18:13.110
And I didn't know what to make of it.

18:14.418 --> 18:16.419
I don't know what's happening here.

18:16.420 --> 18:19.727
I don't know why it is
that I'm hearing voices,

18:19.728 --> 18:22.286
my friends are hearing voices
and footsteps and things.

18:22.287 --> 18:27.267
What is happening here?
I don't have any idea.

18:27.565 --> 18:28.565
[Knocking on door]

18:28.566 --> 18:30.436
I've always been a skeptic.

18:30.437 --> 18:32.202
Uh, so...

18:32.203 --> 18:37.373
I'm thinking there has to be a
physical, practical explanation for it.

18:37.374 --> 18:39.215
- David.
- What's going on?

18:39.216 --> 18:45.116
I suggested to David that maybe we should
start approaching this methodically.

18:45.983 --> 18:48.851
Let's start documenting this.
Let's start experimenting.

18:48.852 --> 18:52.755
This is camera one, day
one, in David's living room.

18:52.756 --> 18:55.758
He laid the entire house
out with the cameras.

18:55.759 --> 18:58.861
Okay, we are now moving
into the living room.

18:58.862 --> 19:00.497
Camera two.

19:00.498 --> 19:01.664
The fireplace.

19:01.665 --> 19:04.915
I don't believe in
ghosts and stuff, but,

19:04.916 --> 19:09.305
you know something, I'm curious as hell.

19:09.306 --> 19:11.129
Camera three.

19:11.130 --> 19:13.830
David's bedroom.

19:14.431 --> 19:19.351
We have all this equipment.
We're all excited.

19:24.921 --> 19:27.154
And we're not really getting anything.

19:27.155 --> 19:29.075
Pint?

19:29.893 --> 19:34.923
It just wasn't a successful
investigation for the first few times.

19:34.924 --> 19:38.824
But I know what happened to me, and...

19:38.825 --> 19:41.205
I had told some friends,
and they think I'm crazy,

19:41.206 --> 19:45.007
and I've got to capture
this stuff on tape.

19:45.008 --> 19:50.908
Every couple of days, Jeff would
show up and just take over the house.

19:53.551 --> 19:56.912
I started going up there more
frequently, thinking just,

19:56.913 --> 20:00.993
you know, maybe I'll get something.

20:01.958 --> 20:04.394
Jeff started to get
a little bit obsessed.

20:04.395 --> 20:07.711
He's over there so much, and
I just started tagging along.

20:07.712 --> 20:10.698
Do you want to use the tripod, or
are you just gonna do it hand held?

20:10.699 --> 20:14.970
I'm gonna do this one hand held, but set
the tripod up, that'd be great for later.

20:14.971 --> 20:18.931
And one night we were there late.

20:19.794 --> 20:24.461
David was tired, and he just
fell asleep on the couch.

20:24.462 --> 20:27.694
There's no one else around.

20:27.695 --> 20:31.175
Panning from left to right.

20:33.023 --> 20:36.923
Coming across to the night table.

20:37.461 --> 20:39.741
And now...

20:40.297 --> 20:43.177
We're at the bed.

20:44.235 --> 20:46.869
What's going on? What is that?

20:46.870 --> 20:48.438
Jeff.

20:48.439 --> 20:50.039
It's like something...

20:50.040 --> 20:52.242
Grabbing it.

20:52.243 --> 20:54.277
It was like he was
wrestling with something.

20:54.278 --> 20:59.378
Somebody's grabbing the
lens and pulling it down.

21:08.848 --> 21:10.133
What's going on?! What is that?

21:10.134 --> 21:11.933
It's like somebody pulled it.

21:11.934 --> 21:13.674
- Jeff.
- I'm telling you.

21:13.675 --> 21:15.199
It's like something...

21:15.200 --> 21:17.600
Grabbing it.

21:17.903 --> 21:19.704
It looked like something yanked him.

21:19.705 --> 21:21.973
Something's grabbing it.

21:21.974 --> 21:25.574
It was just... it was crazy.

21:26.579 --> 21:29.719
I was so scared I
didn't know what to do.

21:29.720 --> 21:32.300
- Jeff.
- I...

21:34.186 --> 21:37.021
And then it just stopped.

21:37.022 --> 21:39.657
He was really spooked, and I
just knew it was time to leave.

21:39.658 --> 21:42.898
Let's get out of here.

21:44.062 --> 21:49.033
We were out of there. I don't
even think we woke David up.

21:49.034 --> 21:50.524
We're both exhausted.

21:50.525 --> 21:56.425
Kashmir has to go to bed, but... but I have
to make sure that I got something on video.

21:56.575 --> 21:59.227
So it's 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning,

21:59.228 --> 22:02.413
I'm in the back of the house with
my computer transferring the video.

22:02.414 --> 22:05.850
Panning from left to right.

22:05.851 --> 22:07.831
Now...

22:08.321 --> 22:11.201
We're at the bed.

22:14.459 --> 22:17.159
[Distorted tones]

22:18.933 --> 22:23.981
I can hear something that sounds like
talking, but it's so low in volume, so I...

22:23.982 --> 22:29.802
I put the footage back, and
I start listening to it again.

22:30.175 --> 22:32.577
[Distorted tones]

22:32.578 --> 22:34.278
It's very faint, and...

22:34.279 --> 22:37.549
So I keep going back to see
if I really heard what I heard.

22:37.550 --> 22:40.518
[High-pitched squealing]

22:40.519 --> 22:43.219
[Distorted tones]

22:44.456 --> 22:47.965
But you can't see anything on
the video. There's nothing there.

22:47.966 --> 22:50.220
But very clearly, you
can hear the voice.

22:50.221 --> 22:52.697
Jeffrey, don't shoot me.

22:52.698 --> 22:57.258
[Distorted voice]
Jeffrey, don't shoot me.

23:03.413 --> 23:05.687
And I just... I...

23:05.688 --> 23:10.008
I just didn't know how to explain it.

23:26.999 --> 23:32.759
Later that evening I went to
bed at 1:35 in the morning.

23:35.240 --> 23:38.840
[Distant footsteps approaching]

23:40.649 --> 23:46.549
A couple of hours later in the
middle of the night, I woke up.

23:54.830 --> 23:57.920
On one level I'm scared because,

23:57.921 --> 24:02.060
you know, when you live in a nice house
and people's homes get burglarized.

24:02.061 --> 24:07.961
Burglars in this day and age usually
carry a gun or some type of a weapon.

24:15.041 --> 24:17.621
[Pensive music]

24:33.944 --> 24:36.704
I grab my rifle.

24:39.109 --> 24:41.749
[Chamber clicks]

24:49.370 --> 24:55.270
And I walked out my bedroom door
looking out the hallway up and down.

25:13.310 --> 25:15.378
[Tin clattering]

25:15.379 --> 25:16.612
Who's there?

25:16.613 --> 25:19.313
[Rapid footsteps]

25:32.129 --> 25:35.829
And I looked into the living room,

25:35.830 --> 25:40.536
looked around to the kitchen,
I didn't see anything.

25:40.537 --> 25:42.504
[Rapid footsteps]

25:42.505 --> 25:45.505
[Projector ratcheting]

25:47.044 --> 25:49.540
I had started hearing sounds.

25:49.541 --> 25:52.901
[Voices speaking distantly]

25:53.650 --> 25:58.520
They were coming from the bottom
floor, from the theater room.

25:58.521 --> 26:02.181
[Voices whispering indistinctly]

26:17.607 --> 26:21.110
I went downstairs to the third
level, and I'm holding the rifle.

26:21.111 --> 26:23.383
I'm... I got the thing off
the safety, and I'm thinking,

26:23.384 --> 26:26.292
oh, my God, and I'm shaking,
going, okay, who's here?

26:26.293 --> 26:28.153
Who the hell is in this house with me?

26:28.154 --> 26:31.814
[Voices whispering indistinctly]

26:43.800 --> 26:44.800
[Whispering stops]

26:44.801 --> 26:47.801
[Projector ratcheting]

26:50.619 --> 26:55.048
I could swear I turned the projector
off at the end of the night.

26:55.049 --> 26:59.849
And it's like, oh, I
must've been mistaken.

27:01.184 --> 27:03.824
[Glass shatters]

27:06.589 --> 27:09.469
[Projector clacking]

27:14.731 --> 27:18.503
I didn't know what to make of it.

27:18.504 --> 27:24.404
But at that point, I was so exhausted
I just went up and went back to bed.

28:02.806 --> 28:05.626
[Crickets chirping]

28:10.497 --> 28:13.317
[Breathing heavily]

28:13.434 --> 28:15.594
[Gunshot]

28:19.755 --> 28:23.475
But he just, psst, disappeared.

28:27.024 --> 28:31.128
It sounded like a bang,
an explosion, a gunshot.

28:31.129 --> 28:34.162
It was dark, and there
was nothing there.

28:34.163 --> 28:37.763
It was just perfectly normal.

28:44.106 --> 28:48.343
The next day, Jeff comes over, and he says,
David, David, I've... I've got something.

28:48.344 --> 28:50.611
I've captured some
stuff on some footage.

28:50.612 --> 28:52.913
It's impossible. It's incredible.

28:52.914 --> 28:55.194
[Crackling]

28:56.670 --> 28:59.320
[Distorted voice]
Jeffrey, don't shoot me.

[High-pitched squealing]

29:09.890 --> 29:11.570
_.

29:12.256 --> 29:15.281
It finally gave me proof that
there was physical evidence

29:15.282 --> 29:17.838
that there were ghosts in my house.

29:17.839 --> 29:19.805
[High-pitched squealing]

29:19.806 --> 29:21.578
Jeffrey, don't shoot me.

29:21.579 --> 29:23.967
In a sense, I was really...

29:23.968 --> 29:29.608
Comfortable and happy to know
that I wasn't going crazy.

29:33.364 --> 29:35.712
After I saw this video footage...

29:35.713 --> 29:38.229
And the gentleman standing
at the foot of my bed.

29:38.230 --> 29:41.597
I kept on wondering who it was...

29:41.598 --> 29:44.918
And what was happening in my house.

29:44.919 --> 29:49.170
The fact that the Manson murders took
place 150 feet down the street was the

29:49.171 --> 29:55.071
only thing that I could come up with
that could possibly be what was going on.

29:55.863 --> 30:00.183
I didn't have anything else to go on.

30:00.668 --> 30:06.568
Being an ex-P.I., I called up my friends
at the Los Angeles Police Department.

30:09.143 --> 30:10.477
Appreciate it.

30:10.478 --> 30:14.090
I was brought a box, over 2,000

30:14.091 --> 30:17.931
filed photos of the crime scene.

30:22.074 --> 30:25.289
Candid photographs of the victims...

30:25.290 --> 30:29.070
In the front yard on the lawn.

30:34.969 --> 30:39.349
It wasn't a pleasant experience at all.

30:47.331 --> 30:50.467
But then I found this photograph.

30:50.468 --> 30:55.405
That's the guy that I saw
in the middle of the night.

30:55.406 --> 30:58.406
It says Jay Sebring.

31:01.846 --> 31:05.047
He was Sharon Tate's ex-fiance.

31:05.048 --> 31:08.288
And one of the victims.

31:10.488 --> 31:13.857
I saw a flash, like a
muzzle of a gun going off...

31:13.858 --> 31:15.125
[Gunshot]

31:15.126 --> 31:19.797
And then the sound that I heard
afterwards was in fact a gunshot.

31:19.798 --> 31:22.499
But why was he pointing
towards the driveway?

31:22.500 --> 31:25.800
What was this all about?

31:31.442 --> 31:34.578
Maybe that related to Steven Parent...

31:34.579 --> 31:40.479
An 18-year-old high school
student who was shot in his car.

31:42.553 --> 31:46.393
This is now starting to add up.

31:48.593 --> 31:54.237
And then I came across a full
body photograph of Sharon Tate.

31:54.238 --> 31:58.502
She had just done Valley of The Dolls.
She was becoming a named personality.

31:58.503 --> 32:03.092
She was becoming more and
more of a public figure.

32:03.093 --> 32:07.567
I thought to myself, maybe
the voices and the intercom...

32:07.568 --> 32:09.699
Footsteps I heard in the house...

32:09.700 --> 32:12.490
And the voice of the woman
in that video footage.

32:12.491 --> 32:14.029
Jeffrey, don't shoot me.

32:14.030 --> 32:15.856
Jeffrey, don't shoot me.

32:15.857 --> 32:21.757
What if they were in fact the spirit of
Sharon Tate trying to communicate with us?

32:31.686 --> 32:34.418
I had felt like I had
come to the end of my rope

32:34.419 --> 32:38.926
of what I was capable of
doing and understanding.

32:38.927 --> 32:42.621
Right now I need to
seek professional help.

32:42.622 --> 32:47.236
I was able to go that evening. I
simply got in the car and drove.

32:47.237 --> 32:52.742
Now, being from the East Coast, I had...
really had no idea where I was going.

32:52.743 --> 32:54.578
So this is it.

32:54.579 --> 32:57.714
If you sort of take a look around.

32:57.715 --> 32:59.616
- I've got some work to do.
- Okay.

32:59.617 --> 33:03.319
You can just kind of do
whatever it is you do.

33:03.320 --> 33:05.889
- All right? Thank you.
- Thanks. Thanks.

33:05.890 --> 33:08.751
I felt, if she doesn't know
anything about the house,

33:08.752 --> 33:12.014
whatever she's experiencing
in the house firsthand will be,

33:12.015 --> 33:16.215
genuine and organic to her experience.

33:23.641 --> 33:29.341
I was left mostly alone
upstairs in the living room area.

33:31.248 --> 33:34.908
[Crows cawing, birds whistling]

33:36.821 --> 33:38.922
I was picking up a strange...

33:38.923 --> 33:43.903
Strange, brittle kind of
energy, a harsh energy.

33:46.463 --> 33:50.700
There was something off-putting
about the environment.

33:50.701 --> 33:52.936
I couldn't put my finger on it.

33:52.937 --> 33:55.517
[Ambient music]

34:09.152 --> 34:12.117
It had gotten icy cold.

34:12.118 --> 34:18.018
Almost to the point where if you
breathe you could see your breath.

34:22.299 --> 34:25.059
I felt something.

34:41.766 --> 34:45.248
That's when I saw her
just walking through.

34:45.250 --> 34:48.489
Like she belonged there.

35:01.147 --> 35:03.751
And I expected her at
any moment to turn and

35:03.752 --> 35:06.532
look at me like another
person in the house.

35:06.533 --> 35:11.273
But she didn't. She
had totally disappeared.

35:12.401 --> 35:18.301
And I started going down the stairs slowly
looking to see where she could've gone.

35:23.178 --> 35:26.658
[Voices whispering distantly]

35:28.917 --> 35:29.917
[Gasps]

35:29.918 --> 35:33.458
- Oh, sorry. Are you okay?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

35:33.459 --> 35:37.895
- Do you have a girlfriend that's here?
- And I'm going, no...

35:37.896 --> 35:41.032
- She goes...
- Well, I just saw this woman pass by.

35:41.033 --> 35:42.634
I said, who do you think it is?

35:42.635 --> 35:43.882
And she goes, I don't know,

35:43.883 --> 35:47.119
but if it wasn't somebody that you
knew, then it was one of the spirits.

35:47.120 --> 35:51.620
I said, I think it's time for a seance.

36:07.350 --> 36:09.930
[Pensive music]

36:11.764 --> 36:14.366
I don't really put a
lot of faith in seances.

36:14.367 --> 36:19.604
I'm not big on the pretense of being able
to speak and communicate with the dead.

36:19.605 --> 36:21.873
But I thought, why not try this?

36:21.874 --> 36:24.814
It's worth a shot.

36:25.845 --> 36:28.806
Alma seems to know what she's
doing. She seems very together.

36:28.807 --> 36:31.614
If there is such a thing as
a professional seance-doer,

36:31.615 --> 36:33.592
she certainly seems to be that.

36:33.593 --> 36:36.855
She has full control of the situation.

36:36.856 --> 36:40.592
She has David shut and lock
all the doors, the windows.

36:40.593 --> 36:43.729
I still think it's kind of
silly at this point, but...

36:43.730 --> 36:45.630
I'm... I'm supporting David.

36:45.631 --> 36:49.434
I'm there for him, and
I'll give this a go.

36:49.435 --> 36:53.461
I had never been to a seance
before. This was my first seance.

36:53.462 --> 36:55.581
And so I just didn't...

36:55.582 --> 36:59.782
I didn't know what was gonna happen.

37:00.747 --> 37:01.913
All set?

37:01.914 --> 37:04.169
I'm good.

37:04.170 --> 37:07.118
I'm standing back
with the camera, and...

37:07.119 --> 37:08.854
She has everybody hold hands.

37:08.855 --> 37:12.875
Everyone, let's hold hands, please.

37:13.426 --> 37:16.216
Whatever you do, we must stay connected.

37:16.217 --> 37:20.938
No matter what happens,
you have to stay connected.

37:20.939 --> 37:24.059
Let's close our eyes.

37:32.712 --> 37:35.412
Is anyone there?

37:56.836 --> 37:57.836
[Gasps]

37:57.837 --> 38:00.171
- What...
- [Gasps]

38:00.172 --> 38:03.675
The flame on the taller
candle bent right in half.

38:03.676 --> 38:05.477
[Gasping]

38:05.478 --> 38:07.338
Wow.

38:07.533 --> 38:10.228
- Are you getting this?
- Yeah.

38:10.229 --> 38:14.729
The other two candles
stayed straight up.

38:15.955 --> 38:17.055
I asked...

38:17.056 --> 38:19.944
Is that you, Sharon?

38:19.945 --> 38:22.105
[Screams]

38:22.780 --> 38:26.197
- All the lights were out.
- The candle instantly went out.

38:26.198 --> 38:27.566
It's okay. I got a light.

38:27.567 --> 38:30.161
- [Gasping]
- Don't break the hold.

38:30.162 --> 38:33.371
That was the answer. That was
Sharon there, she was there.

38:33.372 --> 38:35.674
- [Gasping]
- Don't break the hold.

38:35.675 --> 38:38.255
Stay connected.

38:39.411 --> 38:41.991
Stay connected.

38:42.682 --> 38:45.802
Don't break the hold.

38:45.916 --> 38:48.120
That kind of changed everything.

38:48.121 --> 38:51.322
It just became very intense.

38:51.323 --> 38:53.903
Stay connected.

38:55.361 --> 38:57.104
What the... someone
just grabbed the camera!

38:57.105 --> 38:58.363
Oh, my...

38:58.364 --> 39:01.933
It's like the camera
is moving on its own.

39:01.934 --> 39:03.969
Jeff's like...

39:03.970 --> 39:06.594
Shaking his head with total disbelief.

39:06.595 --> 39:09.440
And then I see Kashmir.

39:09.441 --> 39:11.798
Something started jiggling my chair.

39:11.799 --> 39:13.912
I was literally bouncing up and down.

39:13.913 --> 39:15.279
[Screams]

39:15.280 --> 39:16.414
Oh, my God!

39:16.415 --> 39:18.151
She says, somebody just pushed my chair!

39:18.152 --> 39:20.184
- Oh, my...
- Stay connected.

39:20.185 --> 39:23.788
Calm down. It's going
to be okay. Calm down.

39:23.789 --> 39:25.924
Calm down.

39:25.925 --> 39:28.159
Calm down.

39:28.160 --> 39:30.980
Why are you here?

39:31.497 --> 39:34.317
[Distant screaming]

39:37.657 --> 39:39.404
What is that?

39:39.405 --> 39:44.644
It was the saddest, most
heartbreaking sort of scream.

39:44.645 --> 39:47.585
[Screaming continues]

39:50.770 --> 39:52.238
[Gasps]

39:52.239 --> 39:57.999
And then across the table, I
saw something happen to Alma.

39:58.333 --> 40:01.152
- Alma?
- What's going on?

40:01.153 --> 40:03.562
- I don't know.
- She leaned forward, and she...

40:03.563 --> 40:05.284
She was holding herself.

40:05.285 --> 40:06.932
- Alma?
- What's the matter?

40:06.933 --> 40:07.933
[Gasps]

40:07.934 --> 40:10.334
She stood up, and she's
clutching her stomach.

40:10.335 --> 40:11.627
Oh, my... oh!

40:11.628 --> 40:13.721
- David, what's wrong with...
- What's the matter?

40:13.722 --> 40:15.723
My stomach felt like
something had gone through it.

40:15.724 --> 40:17.884
[Gasping]

40:18.927 --> 40:21.473
- You okay?
- And it was so strong.

40:21.474 --> 40:25.369
- Somebody help us.
- And it was so painful.

40:25.370 --> 40:29.069
It was also really scary.
I mean... what's going on?

40:29.070 --> 40:30.605
- Help me.
- What?

40:30.606 --> 40:33.666
I was being attacked.

40:43.496 --> 40:45.864
Help. Somebody help us.

40:45.865 --> 40:47.332
- [Gasping]
- What's going on?

40:47.333 --> 40:48.333
What... what is it?

40:48.334 --> 40:50.703
- [Gasping]
- Look.

40:50.704 --> 40:52.337
- Oh, it's... help me.
- What?

40:52.338 --> 40:55.107
She grabbed her abdomen. She
was grabbing her upper chest.

40:55.108 --> 40:56.775
She was grabbing her shoulder blades.

40:56.776 --> 40:58.110
Oh, my God.

40:58.111 --> 40:59.574
[Gasping]

40:59.575 --> 41:01.346
This look came over David.

41:01.347 --> 41:03.682
What? What is it?

41:03.683 --> 41:05.584
He said, she's being stabbed.

41:05.585 --> 41:08.165
[Pensive music]

41:10.090 --> 41:14.937
After everything that happened on the night
of the seance, I started to realize...

41:14.938 --> 41:19.681
We were having a shared experience of the
victims that we killed down the street.

41:19.682 --> 41:24.178
At the hands of Charles
Manson and his followers.

41:24.179 --> 41:27.873
<i>Five persons, including the actress Sharon
Tate, were found dead at the home of...</i>

41:27.874 --> 41:30.075
<i>Brutally murdered in the
glare of Hollywood publicity.</i>

41:30.076 --> 41:31.410
<i>Each with multiple stab wounds.</i>

41:31.411 --> 41:33.441
<i>The murders of Sharon Tate
and her guests at her...</i>

41:33.442 --> 41:36.202
<i>At 10050 Cielo...</i>

41:36.440 --> 41:41.954
But my house was 150 feet from where
the murders took place, so why my house?

41:41.955 --> 41:44.438
Described by one investigator
as reminiscent of...

41:44.439 --> 41:49.194
Discovered the crime scene and
then ran screaming to neighbors.

41:49.195 --> 41:52.031
I started to think to myself...

41:52.032 --> 41:56.001
Maybe that they were trying
to escape the house...

41:56.002 --> 42:01.822
And run down the driveway and
seek help from the neighbors.

42:03.927 --> 42:05.486
Maybe it's just the way things are.

42:05.487 --> 42:10.446
Maybe things get looped somehow,
and maybe we hear replays of things.

42:10.447 --> 42:15.847
Are you here, Sharon? Show
us if you are by a sign.

42:16.135 --> 42:20.095
My chair's going crazy right now.

42:22.779 --> 42:24.839
I just heard something.

42:24.840 --> 42:27.757
I just heard something.

42:27.758 --> 42:30.458
