00:00.655 --> 00:02.873
Previously on
<i>Warehouse 13...</i>

00:02.973 --> 00:05.341
Four Regents suffered
artifact-related deaths.

00:05.409 --> 00:07.209
And now a fifth Regent.

00:07.277 --> 00:09.445
How can my mom be a Regent
and not have told me?

00:09.513 --> 00:10.913
Just let me start
at the beginning.

00:10.981 --> 00:12.263
Some other time, Jane--

00:12.331 --> 00:14.099
a time when the Warehouse
isn't under attack

00:14.167 --> 00:15.533
and someone isn't trying
to kill you.

00:15.601 --> 00:17.696
- Artie said you don't torture.
- I'm not Artie.

00:19.196 --> 00:20.661
I can't let you do this.

00:20.729 --> 00:23.562
I drew my gun on Mrs. Frederic,
and she fired me.

00:23.630 --> 00:25.994
What?

Advertise your product or brand here

00:41.387 --> 00:43.325
- You hear that?
- No.

00:44.963 --> 00:46.666
Sounds like somebody's
in trouble.

00:46.733 --> 00:49.237
You want trouble, mister?

00:51.741 --> 00:53.341
Hold that thought,
I beg of you.

01:05.285 --> 01:08.453
Hey, you okay?

01:08.521 --> 01:10.221
No. Don't.

01:10.289 --> 01:13.158
Hello?

01:13.226 --> 01:14.427
Aah!

01:18.768 --> 01:23.840
Oh, my God!
Paul? Paul! Paul...

01:23.907 --> 01:25.074
Aah!

01:37.390 --> 01:40.092
So you just let my mom
walk out--

01:40.160 --> 01:43.062
I don't get to make her stay.
There is a hierarchy here.

01:43.130 --> 01:45.030
There's your mother, the Regent,
Mrs. Frederic,

01:45.098 --> 01:46.565
there's me,
and then there's you.

01:47.867 --> 01:50.201
Oh, sorry. How rude.

01:50.269 --> 01:52.070
There's me, there's Trailer,
and then there's you.

01:52.137 --> 01:54.272
Okay, so how do we protect her
from Walter Sykes

01:54.339 --> 01:55.640
if she's not here?

01:55.707 --> 01:57.276
Her security has been tripled.
She's safe.

01:57.344 --> 01:58.811
The Remati Shackle is safe.

01:58.879 --> 02:00.145
The Warehouse is safe.
The world is safe.

02:00.213 --> 02:01.714
The Universe is safe.
And by the way,

02:01.781 --> 02:04.850
no one asked us to help,
so I don't think that we--

02:04.917 --> 02:06.952
Regent security
has been stretched pretty thin--

02:07.019 --> 02:08.987
Myka, please!
Please, not you, too.

02:09.054 --> 02:10.788
Now, I have a situation here
that I would like to--

02:10.856 --> 02:12.658
Artie, Sykes
has been planning his revenge

02:12.726 --> 02:14.227
for decades!

02:14.295 --> 02:16.829
He wants the Collodi Bracelet.
We need to go out--

02:16.897 --> 02:19.867
The Regents are handling it.
Let it go.

02:19.934 --> 02:22.671
Walter Sykes needs
to be brought to justice.

02:22.739 --> 02:26.408
Ah, see, you're not looking
for justice.

02:26.476 --> 02:29.245
You're looking for vengeance.

02:29.313 --> 02:31.213
If some psycho tried
to off your mother,

02:31.281 --> 02:32.248
wouldn't you want payback?

02:32.316 --> 02:33.750
You never met my mother.

02:33.817 --> 02:35.885
Our job is to do our job.

02:35.953 --> 02:37.954
And, oh, look, we have a ping.
So go pack.

02:38.022 --> 02:39.656
And you are gonna go
to Ithaca, New York.

02:39.724 --> 02:41.492
Bye.

02:41.560 --> 02:44.763
Artie, he does have a point.
Right, Ithaca. Bye.

02:44.830 --> 02:47.065
Leena--
look at this.

02:47.133 --> 02:48.400
Someone's actually doing
as requested.

02:48.468 --> 02:49.835
How is the security-system
upgrade going?

02:49.903 --> 02:51.637
Down to one last diagnostic.

02:51.704 --> 02:53.238
Once I run this,
we're good to go.

02:53.306 --> 02:55.074
Good. Sykes is looking
for weaknesses,

02:55.141 --> 02:58.010
best not to have any.

02:58.078 --> 03:00.946
So is Claudia still upset
about Steve?

03:01.014 --> 03:03.882
I was hoping that
a few days away from this place

03:03.950 --> 03:05.951
would clear her mind.

03:09.455 --> 03:13.658
Artie, what happened
in Atlanta?

03:13.726 --> 03:15.994
Something bad...

03:16.062 --> 03:18.430
Between Steve
and Mrs. Frederic.

03:18.498 --> 03:19.932
A notice was issued
to all government agencies

03:20.000 --> 03:21.467
that Jinks was
persona non grata.

03:21.535 --> 03:24.570
They burned his credit rating
and his passport.

03:24.638 --> 03:27.073
- Oh, my God.
- Don't tell Claudia.

03:27.141 --> 03:29.676
I won't.

03:29.744 --> 03:33.847
- ♪ I'm your

03:33.915 --> 03:37.050

03:49.432 --> 03:52.067
That was awesome.

03:54.170 --> 03:56.504
Johnny Cash,
Astrid Gilberto,

03:56.572 --> 03:58.640
and The Runaways
in the same set.

03:58.707 --> 04:02.110
That's my motto.
Go eclectic or go home.

04:02.177 --> 04:05.112
Yeah, I like to mix it up
on open-mic night.

04:05.180 --> 04:06.514
Claudia, right?

04:06.582 --> 04:08.983
I'm Dwayne Maddox.

04:09.051 --> 04:11.986
Lead singer/guitarist
for Dead Rent--

04:12.054 --> 04:14.255
great band, terrible name.
- So you've seen us.

04:14.323 --> 04:16.757
"South Dakota's most promising
musical export,"

04:16.826 --> 04:18.060
sayeth the blogs.

04:18.128 --> 04:20.495
That was before
the rhythm guitarist

04:20.564 --> 04:21.998
decided to split.

04:22.065 --> 04:24.468
He wanted us to be
the next Black Eyed Peas.

04:24.535 --> 04:26.503
I wanted to be Black Flag.
Just...

04:26.571 --> 04:28.672
Wow.
That's a weird coincidence.

04:28.740 --> 04:30.875
I know exactly what it's like
to lose a partner.

04:30.943 --> 04:33.010
I was wondering
if you'd like to fill in.

04:36.614 --> 04:39.549
Okay.
Um...Wow.

04:39.617 --> 04:41.050
So when do you--

04:41.118 --> 04:42.618
when do you think
you want to jam?

04:42.686 --> 04:45.687
I mean, my schedule is just
a little unpredictable, so...

04:45.754 --> 04:47.422
Well, we rehearse
in my garage.

04:47.490 --> 04:50.491
It's the red house
behind the body shop.

04:50.559 --> 04:53.428
- Say noon tomorrow?
- Yeah, that could work.

04:53.495 --> 04:55.964
All right, see you then.

05:02.606 --> 05:04.040
Hey, what's up?
This is Steve. Leave a message.

05:06.244 --> 05:09.246
Damn it, Jinksy,
call me back.

05:09.314 --> 05:12.015
I want to share.

05:16.854 --> 05:18.955
So you and Paul
were both bitten,

05:19.022 --> 05:20.823
but neither of you saw
what did it?

05:20.891 --> 05:24.894
It was really dark,
and it was really fast.

05:24.962 --> 05:27.096
Then something got
its attention.

05:27.163 --> 05:29.698
I dragged us both into the car
and took off.

05:29.766 --> 05:31.133
May I?

05:36.706 --> 05:38.207
Sorry.

05:43.414 --> 05:44.747
Thank you.

05:47.585 --> 05:49.720
Myka, do you know
what those are?

05:49.788 --> 05:50.955
Some kind of animal maybe.

05:51.023 --> 05:53.425
Human bite marks--
they're human.

05:53.493 --> 05:55.761
Vampire or werewolf?

05:55.828 --> 05:58.697
I don't know, but based
on the location, I would say--

05:58.765 --> 06:00.465
wait a minute,
do you really think that--

06:00.533 --> 06:01.767
No, I don't think!

06:01.835 --> 06:03.569
We deal with artifacts,
not fairy tales.

06:03.637 --> 06:06.106
A lot of those artifacts
come from fairy tales, okay?

06:06.174 --> 06:08.842
Cinderella's knife, right?
Turns people to glass, remember?

06:08.910 --> 06:10.244
I'm just saying it's possible.

06:10.311 --> 06:12.112
Well, I'll believe it
when I see it.

06:12.180 --> 06:13.613
Let's check out
lovers lane.

06:13.681 --> 06:16.116
Okay, but I only go
to third base.

06:21.288 --> 06:23.389
Okay, so Amy said Paul heard
a moaning

06:23.457 --> 06:25.192
coming from that direction.

06:25.259 --> 06:27.994
I'm gonna go that way.
You stay here.

06:28.062 --> 06:31.531
What? Alone?

06:31.599 --> 06:33.366
Okay.

06:33.433 --> 06:34.934
This isn't
a horror movie, Pete.

06:39.439 --> 06:43.541
Uh, yeah, see, see?
Now it's a horror movie.

06:43.609 --> 06:47.378
Myka. Myka...

06:47.446 --> 06:49.546
What are you doing?

06:49.614 --> 06:53.384
I was worried about you
in here all alone.

06:56.154 --> 07:00.358
Wait, wait, wait.
Do you hear that?

07:00.426 --> 07:02.694
Yeah.

07:14.675 --> 07:16.509
What in the hell?

07:18.712 --> 07:21.781
Why is that man eating a deer?

07:24.217 --> 07:27.319
Probably because...

07:27.387 --> 07:29.087
That man is a zombie.

07:32.658 --> 07:35.326
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:36.643 --> 07:39.199
Oh, afraid of guns, huh?

07:39.200 --> 07:42.069
Hold up, zombies aren't
afraid of guns.

07:42.137 --> 07:43.504
That's because
he's not a zombie.

07:43.571 --> 07:45.239
He's probably just been affected
by something

07:45.306 --> 07:47.808
that we know is real--
an artifact.

07:47.875 --> 07:49.209
Maybe if we just--
we talk to him...

07:49.277 --> 07:50.644
No, no, no, no, no.

07:50.712 --> 07:53.914
No, you don't talk
to the living dead.

07:53.981 --> 07:56.049
You either run away
really fast,

07:56.117 --> 07:58.752
or you shoot 'em in the head.
Pop, pop!

07:58.820 --> 08:01.656
Sir, I'm Agent Bering.
This is Agent Lattimer.

08:01.723 --> 08:03.891
We're with the Secret Service.

08:03.959 --> 08:05.960
Okay, we just want
to help you.

08:06.028 --> 08:07.996
Do you--
do you understand me?

08:11.568 --> 08:13.035
Aah!

08:13.103 --> 08:14.537
Myka!

08:17.141 --> 08:18.408
Cover me.

08:22.412 --> 08:24.280
Easy.

08:29.620 --> 08:31.188
God, he's really cold.

08:31.256 --> 08:34.958
Yeah, further proof
that he's not alive.

08:35.025 --> 08:36.494
Careful. Careful. Myka!

08:36.561 --> 08:39.063
- It only takes one bite.
- Will you be quiet?

08:40.433 --> 08:43.268
Aha.

08:43.335 --> 08:45.036
All right, we have...

08:45.104 --> 08:47.271
Kevin Monroe, 36 years old.

08:47.339 --> 08:50.542
Lives here in town
at 127 Briarwood Lane.

08:50.609 --> 08:52.544
All right, well,
does he have anything

08:52.612 --> 08:53.645
artifact-y on him?

08:53.713 --> 08:56.448
Well, not that I can see.

08:56.516 --> 08:58.984
Let's get him
to a hospital.

08:59.052 --> 09:02.287
Artie, will you please tell Pete
that the undead do not exist?

09:02.355 --> 09:03.789
Don't be ridiculous.

09:03.857 --> 09:06.125
- Of course they exist.
- Thank you. What?

09:06.193 --> 09:07.527
- What?
- Told you.

09:07.594 --> 09:09.329
Only in the technical sense.

09:09.397 --> 09:11.064
Ha ha.
I told you.

09:11.132 --> 09:13.601
There are several artifacts
known to simulate living death.

09:13.668 --> 09:15.636
Show me the victim.

09:18.173 --> 09:20.908
Hmm, necrotic dermal
discoloration,

09:20.976 --> 09:22.443
and around his mouth,
hyper-stimulation

09:22.510 --> 09:23.911
of the salivary glands.

09:23.978 --> 09:26.280
Off the bat, I'd say
he's got two symptoms

09:26.347 --> 09:28.315
that are consistent--

09:28.383 --> 09:32.051
Peas...Elk...Bison!

09:35.155 --> 09:37.090
Pete, look in his eyes.

09:37.157 --> 09:40.693
That's not anger.
That's--that's fear.

09:40.761 --> 09:42.729
It kind of sounded
like he said,

09:42.797 --> 09:45.699
"Peas, Elk, Bison."

09:45.767 --> 09:50.103
Yeah, well, at least there's
some vegetables in there.

09:52.206 --> 09:54.274
Artie, listen, the doctor said
that he had frostbite

09:54.342 --> 09:55.876
on his toes and ears,

09:55.943 --> 09:57.510
but Ithaca's been in the middle
of a heat wave.

09:57.578 --> 09:59.880
Yeah, check out his house.
I am on the next flight out.

09:59.947 --> 10:02.515
And whatever you do,
you keep him restrained.

10:02.583 --> 10:06.620
Hold down the fort.

10:20.102 --> 10:22.671
I thought I had two days off.

10:22.738 --> 10:24.540
Leena's busy.
I'm getting on a plane.

10:24.607 --> 10:26.075
I need you to do
some research.

10:26.143 --> 10:28.544
Everything we've got
on living-death artifacts.

10:28.612 --> 10:30.213
Yeah, Artie,
you specifically forbade me--

10:30.281 --> 10:33.851
I changed my mind.
I'm mercurial. Deal with it.

10:33.918 --> 10:37.154
Yeah, not exactly the
adjective I'd choose right now.

10:42.794 --> 10:44.228
Come on, Steve, pick up the--

10:44.296 --> 10:45.929
What, Claudia?

10:45.997 --> 10:47.264
Oh, my God.
Jinksy!

10:47.332 --> 10:50.868
I can't--
wow. I've, um--

10:50.935 --> 10:52.335
I've just been dying
to talk to you.

10:52.403 --> 10:54.704
Yeah, I could tell
from the last 800 messages.

10:54.772 --> 10:57.272
Okay, it wasn't that many.

10:57.340 --> 10:59.307
What do you want?

10:59.375 --> 11:01.743
Um, okay,
<i>Cliffsnotes</i> version--

11:01.811 --> 11:04.279
I met this really hot musician
at open-mic yesterday.

11:04.347 --> 11:08.050
Pretty sure he wants me.
Pretty sure I want him.

11:08.117 --> 11:09.818
I mean, I know I've only
known this guy

11:09.886 --> 11:11.620
less than 24 hours,
but how can you tell?

11:11.688 --> 11:12.754
What if he's my one?

11:12.822 --> 11:14.756
Claudia, I can't do this.

11:14.824 --> 11:17.826
What?
Talk to your B.F.F.E.?

11:17.894 --> 11:19.462
What the hell is
a B.F.F.E.?

11:19.529 --> 11:20.896
Best friend
forever and ever.

11:20.964 --> 11:23.633
Look, we're not B.F.F.E.s.

11:23.701 --> 11:25.067
We were co-workers,
and now we're not,

11:25.135 --> 11:28.004
which makes us...
Nothing.

11:28.072 --> 11:29.739
Nothing?

11:29.807 --> 11:31.874
Steve, why would you--

11:31.942 --> 11:34.277
I can't be any clearer,
Claudia.

11:34.345 --> 11:36.913
Stop calling me.

11:36.981 --> 11:39.049
Lose my number.

11:41.019 --> 11:42.520
Yeah, Steve, no problem.

11:42.587 --> 11:44.288
I'll just forget everything
about our awesome friendship

11:44.356 --> 11:45.456
if you'll just tell me,

11:45.524 --> 11:48.426
why are you being
such a tool?

11:53.065 --> 12:00.404
♪ ♪

12:01.907 --> 12:04.141
Okay...

12:04.209 --> 12:05.676
I'll bite.

12:12.549 --> 12:14.450
Okay, Sallah.

12:14.518 --> 12:17.519
Wasn't really the question.

12:28.565 --> 12:30.899
She raised her eyebrow
at this

12:30.967 --> 12:33.035
and walked on.

12:43.513 --> 12:44.780
Yep.

12:48.050 --> 12:50.318
Oh--oh, God, wow.

12:50.386 --> 12:52.821
Hello from Miami Beach.

12:52.888 --> 12:54.922
90 degrees.

12:54.990 --> 12:57.291
He was obviously freezing.

12:57.359 --> 12:58.659
Why?

12:58.727 --> 13:00.294
You scope out
the living room.

13:00.361 --> 13:02.829
I'm gonna see if I can stand
the heat in the kitchen.

13:07.968 --> 13:09.401
Pete, you hear that?

13:13.272 --> 13:15.140
Secret Service! Come on out
with your hands up!

13:17.310 --> 13:18.243
- Locked.
- Psst.

13:31.392 --> 13:34.461
Hey.
Hey, it's okay.

13:34.528 --> 13:37.164
It's okay.
I'm Myka.

13:37.232 --> 13:41.067
Everything's gonna be okay.

13:41.135 --> 13:43.369
- Mykes.
- Yeah?

13:43.437 --> 13:46.606
Peas, Elk, Bison.

13:46.674 --> 13:48.508
"Please help my son."

13:50.511 --> 13:54.013
- Hey, Artie.
- Hey, listen, do we have--

13:54.081 --> 13:55.682
Pete, what are you doing
with this--

13:55.749 --> 13:56.816
- Artie...
- Who--

13:56.884 --> 13:58.484
- Come here.
- Who is this?

13:58.552 --> 14:01.154
Well, this
is Kevin Monroe's son.

14:01.222 --> 14:02.589
We found him hiding
in the closet.

14:02.656 --> 14:03.990
- Hiding?
- Mm.

14:04.058 --> 14:05.291
Was he there when
his father was affected?

14:05.359 --> 14:06.659
Did he--
did he see the artifact?

14:06.727 --> 14:08.327
We have no idea.
The kid hasn't said a word.

14:08.395 --> 14:10.964
The only reason we know his name
is from a tag on his backpack.

14:11.032 --> 14:15.001
Artie, this is Danny.
Danny, Artie.

14:15.068 --> 14:16.569
Hey.

14:16.637 --> 14:20.140
How are you...?

14:20.208 --> 14:22.108
I'm sure it's not
the eyebrows.

14:22.176 --> 14:24.344
What do you mean?

14:28.683 --> 14:29.583
Hey, buddy.

14:32.253 --> 14:33.753
Hey, you know,
your dad's just--

14:33.821 --> 14:36.756
he's just taking a nap.

14:36.824 --> 14:38.325
I got an idea.

14:38.392 --> 14:41.895
How about you and me
go get a candy bar?

14:45.266 --> 14:46.967
So how is his dad doing?

14:47.035 --> 14:48.702
Well,
he's sedated for now.

14:48.770 --> 14:50.805
Amy and Paul, the couple
from the woods--any symptoms?

14:50.873 --> 14:52.640
Nothing yet,
but listen to this.

14:52.708 --> 14:55.144
I think whatever affected
Kevin Monroe is spreading.

14:55.211 --> 14:57.947
Now, a few minutes ago,
campus police at SUNY-Ithaca

14:58.015 --> 15:00.149
got this call from
the Psi Phi Zeta frat house.

15:00.217 --> 15:01.450
Listen to this.

15:01.518 --> 15:02.585
Send someone over here now.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.254
He's crazy.

15:04.321 --> 15:06.689
He ate a squirrel,
and he keeps trying to bite me.

15:08.125 --> 15:10.092
Get the hell away from me!

15:10.160 --> 15:12.161
Okay, now,
it's a frat house,

15:12.229 --> 15:13.930
but still,
the artifact could be there.

15:13.998 --> 15:16.166
But how did Kevin Monroe
come into contact with it?

15:16.233 --> 15:18.802
- Was he an alumnus or--
- I'm still working on that.

15:18.869 --> 15:21.371
But right now we just have
to contain this thing.

15:21.438 --> 15:24.006
- Yeah.
- Hey.

15:24.074 --> 15:28.710
Okay, we have to go.
I'll explain on the way.

15:28.778 --> 15:31.212
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Artie, um...

15:31.280 --> 15:32.547
- What about Danny?
- Who?

15:32.614 --> 15:35.482
- The kid.
- Oh, what about him?

15:35.550 --> 15:39.352
Artie, we--we just found him
cowering in a closet by him--

15:39.420 --> 15:41.021
he can't be left alone.
You got to stay with him.

15:41.088 --> 15:42.755
- Yeah.
- Me? No.

15:42.823 --> 15:44.924
I don't--
I have no idea.

15:44.992 --> 15:46.192
He probably saw
something, right?

15:46.260 --> 15:48.428
Talk to him.
Get him to open up.

15:48.495 --> 15:50.163
Yeah, show him some
of that papa Nielsen charm.

15:50.231 --> 15:51.298
- Don't touch me!
- Okay.

15:51.365 --> 15:53.066
Um, all right,

15:53.133 --> 15:55.169
uh, you go check out
<i>Animal House</i>, and I'll...

15:55.236 --> 15:57.704
Cajole.

15:57.772 --> 15:59.073
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

15:59.141 --> 16:02.376
- Good game.
- Uhh!

16:02.444 --> 16:05.112
See what you can find out
from the frat boys.

16:05.180 --> 16:08.582
I'll make sure the campus
gendarmes give us some space.

16:12.254 --> 16:15.223
Agent Bering.
Somebody fill me in.

16:15.291 --> 16:16.591
Fenton Wallis,
house president.

16:16.659 --> 16:17.859
Everyone just calls me Wally.

16:17.927 --> 16:19.660
- So what happened here?
- Moose freaked.

16:19.728 --> 16:21.462
A moose?

16:21.530 --> 16:22.963
One of our newbies--

16:23.031 --> 16:26.199
came back from a burrito run
whining about being cold.

16:26.266 --> 16:27.533
Then he starts eating
all the food,

16:27.601 --> 16:28.768
then all of a sudden,
he just goes psycho,

16:28.836 --> 16:30.002
starts trying to bite people.

16:30.070 --> 16:31.970
Did you see him actually
bite anyone?

16:32.038 --> 16:33.638
Lady, after he took
a swipe at me,

16:33.706 --> 16:35.306
all I saw was
the basement door slam shut.

16:35.374 --> 16:38.076
I think he's still down there
tearing through the pantry.

16:38.143 --> 16:39.477
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:39.545 --> 16:41.813
So we got ten minutes
before the boys in blue show up.

16:41.881 --> 16:43.715
Let's go find us an artifact.

16:43.783 --> 16:44.950
Okay.

16:45.018 --> 16:47.653
30 guys under one roof,

16:47.720 --> 16:50.022
and no one takes the time
to change a lightbulb.

16:50.090 --> 16:52.124
Are you asking me
how many frat boys it takes

16:52.192 --> 16:53.893
to change a lightbulb?

16:53.960 --> 16:57.596
- Because I would say...
- Please don't.

16:57.664 --> 17:00.666
Well...

17:00.734 --> 17:02.302
Ooh, tacos.

17:02.369 --> 17:04.337
Oh, man, I hope that truck's
still out there.

17:04.405 --> 17:06.906
Don't start with me, okay?

17:06.973 --> 17:08.575
My blood sugar is crashing.

17:08.642 --> 17:10.175
Oh, jeez!

17:10.243 --> 17:12.278
Ooh!

17:12.346 --> 17:15.281
Dude, I hate rats.

17:26.027 --> 17:29.363
Cold...
So hungry.

17:29.430 --> 17:31.866
Help me. Help me.

17:31.933 --> 17:35.036
Moose, listen,
it's gonna be okay.

17:35.103 --> 17:36.270
Aah!

17:36.338 --> 17:39.307
Myka!

17:39.375 --> 17:43.012
Aah!

17:43.079 --> 17:45.882
- Are you okay? Huh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

17:45.949 --> 17:47.917
- Did he get you?
- No, no, I'm fine.

17:47.985 --> 17:50.554
Let's just, uh--just get him
to the hospital.

17:50.622 --> 17:53.391
Is it safe to come out?

17:53.458 --> 17:56.528
Aaah! Aah--

18:01.267 --> 18:04.468
- Are you okay?
- It bit me, Mykes.

18:04.536 --> 18:06.337
It bit me.

18:13.642 --> 18:15.864
- How long ago was he bitten?
- A few minutes ago.

18:15.865 --> 18:17.532
How long before
the effects kick in?

18:17.600 --> 18:20.234
No idea. Amy and Paul
were bitten hours ago,

18:20.302 --> 18:22.136
and they're both still
asymptomatic.

18:22.204 --> 18:24.504
So it could take anywhere
from three minutes to...

18:24.572 --> 18:26.874
to never happening at all.

18:26.941 --> 18:29.576
It depends on the artifact.
Do you have any leads?

18:29.644 --> 18:31.411
Uh, no.
I'm still working on it.

18:31.478 --> 18:34.580
Work faster!
And, Myka, Myka...

18:34.648 --> 18:38.751
If he gets a strange look...
Watch yourself.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.161
Was Moose from Ithaca?

18:48.229 --> 18:50.496
Was he related
to a Kevin Monroe?

18:50.564 --> 18:52.632
Wisconsin.
His last name's Mulder.

18:52.700 --> 18:54.535
Was Kevin Monroe ever
pledged to this house,

18:54.602 --> 18:55.903
say, around 15 years ago?

18:55.971 --> 18:58.306
We only got chartered
last year.

18:58.373 --> 18:59.340
Myka.

19:04.280 --> 19:06.882
Listen, uh...

19:06.950 --> 19:10.286
When it happens, I want you
to be the one who puts me down.

19:10.354 --> 19:11.721
Okay.

19:11.788 --> 19:14.290
I know it's not gonna be--
wait. Wait. What?

19:14.357 --> 19:17.492
Two shots to the head, right?
Pop, pop.

19:17.560 --> 19:20.362
- Mykes...
- Everything's gonna be fine.

19:20.429 --> 19:22.163
Okay? I'll drop you off
at the hospital.

19:22.231 --> 19:23.698
Wait, wait.
No, no, no, no, no.

19:23.765 --> 19:26.233
I'm not just gonna sit around
waiting for it to happen.

19:26.301 --> 19:28.435
Okay? I mean, I'm gonna
make sure we find this thing.

19:32.206 --> 19:34.708
Make it stop. Make it stop.

19:36.344 --> 19:40.682
It's too bright.
Oh, my eyes!

19:40.749 --> 19:43.818
Oh, make it stop.
Make it stop.

19:43.886 --> 19:45.320
Wait.
They're sensitive to light.

19:45.388 --> 19:47.355
Remember Kevin Monroe,
in the woods?

19:47.423 --> 19:49.124
He flinched
from our flashlights.

19:49.192 --> 19:51.794
- Oh, sorry. I'm just--

19:51.862 --> 19:53.129
I'm freakin' starving.

19:53.196 --> 19:56.131
A human flesh
kind of starving,

19:56.199 --> 19:58.567
that--that kind
of starving or...?

19:58.634 --> 20:01.302
No, like Pete Lattimer
starving.

20:01.370 --> 20:02.804
It's just I can't do this
on an empty stomach.

20:02.871 --> 20:04.639
- I'm gonna go get a taco.
- Really? Now?

20:09.510 --> 20:11.745
<i>Hola, amigo.</i>

20:11.812 --> 20:16.283
Uh, <i>una burrito grande</i>
<i>especial...</i>

20:16.350 --> 20:20.687
<i>Por favor, rapido.</i>
<i>Gracias. Comprende?</i>

20:20.755 --> 20:23.389
Yeah, I get it, gringo.
I speak English, bro.

20:23.457 --> 20:25.925
Okay, well,
I'm just, you know...

20:25.993 --> 20:27.560
- Pete.
- Yeah.

20:27.628 --> 20:29.362
At Kevin Monroe's house,
it was hot, right?

20:29.430 --> 20:30.530
- It was, like, 90 degrees.
- Yeah.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.131
And they said
Moose was freezing.

20:32.199 --> 20:34.233
Right, so I'm thinking that
the artifact works in stages.

20:34.301 --> 20:36.302
Well, that's how
zombies work, Mykes.

20:36.369 --> 20:37.503
You know,
there's the blood bite,

20:37.570 --> 20:39.738
sickness, death, rotting.

20:39.806 --> 20:40.705
And then all you want to do
is, like...

20:42.642 --> 20:43.575
<i>Gracias, senor.</i>

20:43.643 --> 20:45.410
<i>Seis dolares.</i>

20:45.478 --> 20:48.513
Pay the man, Mykes.

20:48.581 --> 20:49.747
Okay.

20:49.815 --> 20:51.782
<i>Orale,</i> homes.

20:51.850 --> 20:53.250
I'm coming back
for seconds.

20:53.318 --> 20:56.187
This is delicious.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.722
Okay, that's, like,
28 bucks you owe me now.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.157
Can I get a special?

21:00.459 --> 21:02.927
So, Danny...

21:02.995 --> 21:05.798
Any interest in cryptography?

21:05.866 --> 21:07.566
Piano nocturnes?

21:07.634 --> 21:09.502
'Cause they're--no.

21:14.075 --> 21:15.676
Cold War espionage.

21:15.743 --> 21:18.145
Yeah. Ecch.

21:18.213 --> 21:20.080
Um, right.

21:23.085 --> 21:25.186
I'm gonna go check
on your dad.

21:25.254 --> 21:26.821
You stay put.

21:38.166 --> 21:39.733
What--what's happening?

21:39.801 --> 21:41.401
He's going
through I.V. bags

21:41.469 --> 21:43.837
almost as fast
as I can hang 'em.

21:43.905 --> 21:45.605
If that wasn't weird enough,

21:45.673 --> 21:47.307
there's no clear sign
of infection,

21:47.375 --> 21:50.177
viral or bacterial.

21:52.213 --> 21:54.714
He is ice cold.

21:54.782 --> 21:57.117
Last reading, body temp
was 89 and dropping.

21:57.185 --> 21:59.453
If we don't reverse this,

21:59.520 --> 22:01.354
he's gonna go
into organ failure.

22:01.422 --> 22:02.522
Excuse me.

22:14.568 --> 22:17.437
Oh, come on. Again?

22:19.640 --> 22:22.442
Oh!

22:22.509 --> 22:23.843
Ow...

22:23.911 --> 22:25.011
No!

22:29.916 --> 22:31.951
Oh...

22:39.626 --> 22:40.760
Of course.

22:43.430 --> 22:44.831
Yo.

22:44.899 --> 22:46.966
Claudia, did you get the
information that I asked you--

22:47.034 --> 22:48.701
Yes!

22:48.769 --> 22:50.403
What do you thi--
of course!

22:50.470 --> 22:51.570
Yes!

22:51.638 --> 22:53.205
Claudia, is everything
all right?

22:53.272 --> 22:56.508
Just a little temporary,
possibly terminal

22:56.576 --> 22:58.610
technical difficulties--
all good now.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.545
Claudia...

23:00.613 --> 23:02.280
What is wrong?

23:02.347 --> 23:03.915
Nothing.
Quit worrying, Nana.

23:03.982 --> 23:06.350
So, listen, on the shelf,

23:06.418 --> 23:08.819
we have the Torch of Thanatos,
Marie Laveau's crucifix,

23:08.887 --> 23:10.554
and the Bodhidharma's slippers.

23:10.622 --> 23:12.423
But unfortunately,
that's all I can tell you

23:12.490 --> 23:13.590
until this search speeds up.

23:13.658 --> 23:15.126
So any new deets?

23:15.194 --> 23:17.262
Causes extreme metabolic
shifts and temperature drops,

23:17.329 --> 23:20.900
while simultaneously triggering
intense carnivorous craving.

23:20.968 --> 23:23.870
Cravings.
Well, I'll cross-ref when I can

23:23.938 --> 23:25.305
to see what pops,

23:25.373 --> 23:28.008
but the network's been
uber-sluggish lately.

23:28.076 --> 23:29.677
It's weird, actually.
I don't know.

23:29.745 --> 23:31.546
Well, call me
when you get something,

23:31.613 --> 23:34.582
and then you can resume
your R&R.

23:34.650 --> 23:36.884
Thank you.

23:41.056 --> 23:43.324
Yes, Leena?

23:45.160 --> 23:46.961
Yes, I know someone
named Dwayne.

23:47.029 --> 23:48.862
He's where now?

23:52.367 --> 23:53.934
Dwayne.

23:54.002 --> 23:55.402
Hey.

23:55.470 --> 23:57.805
You're...

23:57.873 --> 23:59.073
You're where I live.

23:59.141 --> 24:00.975
Yeah, I, uh, asked around.

24:01.043 --> 24:03.878
Look, if you're not
into joining the band...

24:03.946 --> 24:07.149
I mean, that would suck,
but--but I get it.

24:07.217 --> 24:08.951
And I was just still hoping
that we could--

24:09.019 --> 24:11.054
Not into--
no, wait. What?

24:11.122 --> 24:12.422
Well, when you blew off
rehearsal, I just assumed--

24:12.490 --> 24:15.225
No, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

24:15.293 --> 24:17.394
That was not rejection.
That was me trying to juggle,

24:17.462 --> 24:19.563
and I'm all thumbs.

24:19.631 --> 24:21.798
So, um, okay, I just have
one more little thing

24:21.866 --> 24:23.067
I have to do at work, okay?

24:23.134 --> 24:24.835
And then I'm all yours.

24:24.902 --> 24:26.971
- I mean to rehearse.
- Yeah.

24:27.039 --> 24:28.672
Oh, my God.
Let me just go get my guitar,

24:28.740 --> 24:29.840
and then I'll go straight to--
whoa!

24:29.907 --> 24:32.242
Hey--

24:32.310 --> 24:34.411
- Dwayne!

24:36.281 --> 24:37.748
I've never had
a hot rocker girl

24:37.816 --> 24:39.783
literally throw herself
at me before.

24:43.588 --> 24:44.588
Look out!

24:53.098 --> 24:55.032
Oh, my God.
Are you guys all right?

24:55.100 --> 24:57.234
Uh, yeah, yeah. Fine.

24:57.302 --> 24:58.703
Great, actually.

24:58.770 --> 25:02.106
Oh, my God.
I cannot believe this.

25:02.174 --> 25:04.442
- Claudia, what's wrong?
- I got to get out of here.

25:04.509 --> 25:05.676
Claudia, wait.
I just--

25:05.744 --> 25:06.777
You need to stay
as far away from me

25:06.845 --> 25:08.679
as possible right now--trust me.
- Why?

25:08.747 --> 25:10.647
Because I'm marked
for death.

25:14.119 --> 25:16.254
76 and still dropping.

25:16.321 --> 25:17.655
If we don't get
his body temperature up,

25:17.723 --> 25:19.524
this man is gonna be dead
in an hour.

25:19.591 --> 25:22.827
I'm gonna talk to the doctor
about putting him on bypass.

25:47.822 --> 25:50.757
The doctor's on his way back
to the--

25:52.360 --> 25:55.662
Good. It stopped dropping.
Maybe he's stabilizing.

25:55.730 --> 25:57.131
It's not gonna last.

25:57.198 --> 25:58.799
Where did those glasses
come from?

25:58.866 --> 26:00.233
Alfred Butz,
inventor of the thermostat.

26:00.301 --> 26:02.069
Huh?

26:02.137 --> 26:05.038
Uh...great Uncle Alfie's
glasses.

26:05.106 --> 26:07.775
Same prescription, oddly.

26:07.842 --> 26:09.376
I'm gonna go check
on the two kids

26:09.444 --> 26:10.944
who were attacked
in the woods.

26:11.012 --> 26:12.412
Oh, well, those two were
patched up

26:12.480 --> 26:13.580
and discharged hours ago.

26:17.720 --> 26:21.456
They were bitten...
and they're fine.

26:21.524 --> 26:23.058
That means
something else caused--

26:24.294 --> 26:26.229
Hey, stop him!

26:28.933 --> 26:31.535
Help me out here.
Kid ate through the restraints.

26:31.603 --> 26:33.304
Aah!

26:37.142 --> 26:39.043
Why do they crank
the A.C. in here?

26:39.111 --> 26:40.278
Really?
'Cause I'm sweating my--

26:40.345 --> 26:42.246
- Aah!
- That was Moose.

26:42.314 --> 26:44.381
Stop him!

26:44.449 --> 26:46.817
Everybody out!
Get out, now!

26:46.885 --> 26:49.053
Let's go! Get out of there!
Get out! Come on!

26:49.121 --> 26:51.122
Take the shot, Mykes.

26:51.190 --> 26:53.458
Mykes, take the shot!

27:01.032 --> 27:02.133
Where'd you go?

27:02.200 --> 27:04.435
I-I don't know.

27:06.271 --> 27:09.573
So...Hungry.

27:09.641 --> 27:11.976
Oh, man,
don't make me do this.

27:19.183 --> 27:21.418
Don't come any closer.

27:21.485 --> 27:24.221
Just stop right there.

27:24.288 --> 27:26.389
Don't--
don't come any closer.

27:26.457 --> 27:29.158
I will shoot you!

27:37.602 --> 27:39.971
Is he...?
Hypothermia, starvation.

27:40.039 --> 27:41.906
So what,
I'm gonna freeze to death?

27:41.974 --> 27:43.775
- You feeling cold?
- No, but I've been bitten.

27:43.843 --> 27:44.977
There's nothing wrong
with you.

27:45.044 --> 27:46.378
Whatever this artifact is,

27:46.446 --> 27:47.913
its effects are not spread
by biting.

27:47.981 --> 27:49.482
Thank God.

27:49.549 --> 27:50.583
You hear that, Mykes?

27:54.688 --> 27:56.188
I'm so cold.

28:09.283 --> 28:12.586
I don't want to be
one of the undead.

28:12.653 --> 28:15.655
And I don't want you...

28:15.723 --> 28:18.024
putting me down.

28:18.592 --> 28:22.261
Look, we are gonna find
this thing, Myka.

28:22.329 --> 28:25.298
You're gonna be okay.

28:25.366 --> 28:27.033
I promise.

28:27.101 --> 28:28.368
Okay.

28:42.416 --> 28:44.117
She must have come in contact
with the artifact.

28:44.185 --> 28:45.486
Yeah, but where--

28:45.553 --> 28:48.255
the woods, Kevin's place,
the frat house?

28:48.323 --> 28:50.224
What do we know?
Stage one--sever chills.

28:50.292 --> 28:51.492
Stage two--
intense hunger.

28:51.560 --> 28:52.660
Stage three--
hypothermia, malnutrition.

28:52.728 --> 28:54.495
Stage four--death.

28:54.563 --> 28:56.899
I mean, come on, Artie,

28:56.967 --> 28:58.901
you have to have some idea
what we're dealing with here.

28:58.969 --> 29:01.137
Everyone that's been impacted
by this artifact

29:01.205 --> 29:03.073
is either too far gone
to talk or dead.

29:03.141 --> 29:05.108
Not everyone.

29:12.917 --> 29:14.551
Hey.

29:14.619 --> 29:16.353
You know, Danny,

29:16.421 --> 29:20.123
my dad was once
really sick, too,

29:20.191 --> 29:22.493
and I spent the whole time
at the hospital

29:22.560 --> 29:27.064
just wishing that there was
something I could do to help.

29:27.132 --> 29:29.767
Bet you know
how that feels. Yeah.

29:29.835 --> 29:32.203
But you can help,
and not just your dad.

29:32.271 --> 29:35.273
There are other people
in trouble, too.

29:42.348 --> 29:45.550
Do you want to give her
the magic glasses?

29:51.824 --> 29:54.525
No, Danny, I'll be fine.

29:54.593 --> 29:56.927
Thank you, though.

29:56.995 --> 29:59.697
Okay, how can I help?

29:59.765 --> 30:01.565
Did your dad come
in contact

30:01.633 --> 30:05.302
with any strange things
lately?

30:05.370 --> 30:07.971
Any weird--weird--
nothing.

30:08.039 --> 30:10.807
Do you remember when he first
started feeling cold?

30:10.875 --> 30:14.077
- Last night after dinner.
- What'd he eat for dinner?

30:14.145 --> 30:15.345
He wanted to try
the new burger place,

30:15.413 --> 30:16.713
but the line was too long,

30:16.781 --> 30:18.949
so we just stopped
at a food truck on the way home.

30:19.017 --> 30:22.053
Tacos? Tacos, Danny?

30:22.120 --> 30:24.521
Tacos from here, Danny?

30:24.589 --> 30:26.590
Yeah, Manny's.
He's nice.

30:26.657 --> 30:28.858
Artie, something on that truck
is altering the food.

30:28.926 --> 30:30.326
Kevin and Moose
both ate there.

30:30.394 --> 30:31.527
Myka, what did you eat?

30:31.595 --> 30:33.529
Off the truck?
Who am I, Pete?

30:33.597 --> 30:36.265
Okay, fine. But still,
that truck must be the nexus,

30:36.332 --> 30:37.499
and the artifact's
got to be there.

30:37.567 --> 30:38.866
- We got to find the truck.
- I'm on it.

30:38.934 --> 30:41.169
I just started following Manny's
on Twitter today.

30:41.236 --> 30:42.837
See, sometimes being
obsessed with food

30:42.905 --> 30:44.339
and social networking
is a good thing.

30:44.407 --> 30:46.308
- Pete.
- Okay. His last Tweet was

30:46.376 --> 30:48.010
from a construction site nearby.
- Let's go.

30:48.078 --> 30:49.178
Wait, wait, wait.
Myka. Myka...

30:49.246 --> 30:50.580
Don't you think
you should stay here?

30:50.647 --> 30:52.816
I'm not gonna stay here
waiting to turn, okay?

30:52.883 --> 30:54.885
I-I want to be there
when we find it.

30:54.953 --> 30:57.354
I'm gonna drive.
It'll--it'll keep me focused.

30:57.422 --> 30:59.490
Any excuse to drive.

30:59.558 --> 31:01.793
All right, just go.

31:05.030 --> 31:07.631
So...

31:07.699 --> 31:09.700
Was your dad okay?

31:09.767 --> 31:12.969
Oh, he was fine.

31:13.037 --> 31:14.804
No, no, he...

31:14.872 --> 31:17.306
Everything turned out
just fine.

31:19.209 --> 31:21.877
He's still a pain
in the butt.

31:25.982 --> 31:27.950
All right,
mister all-seeing, all-knowing,

31:28.018 --> 31:29.819
I'm sorry I doubted you.
You obviously know what's what.

31:29.886 --> 31:31.154
Otherwise,
you wouldn't be here, right?

31:31.221 --> 31:34.658
So I got to know,
am I really gonna die tonight?

31:41.199 --> 31:44.202
Okay. Obviously
I didn't enunciate.

31:44.270 --> 31:47.071
Am I going to die tonight?

31:54.946 --> 31:57.448
Okay. It's on.

32:06.591 --> 32:09.059
It's bath time.

32:11.162 --> 32:12.864
Ooh, slippery, isn't it?

32:12.931 --> 32:14.632
Yeah, get you some.

32:18.737 --> 32:19.870
Oh-ho-ho!

32:19.938 --> 32:23.907
In your face, <i>Grim Reaper</i>!

32:23.975 --> 32:25.408
<i>Adieu.</i>

32:25.476 --> 32:27.377
What a day.

32:34.718 --> 32:36.719
Oh, come on.

32:38.622 --> 32:42.958
Whoa. Water's not supposed
to do that.

32:43.026 --> 32:44.626
Somebody?

32:48.497 --> 32:50.431
Leena?

32:50.499 --> 32:51.900
Somebody? Anybody!

32:51.968 --> 32:53.835
Help me!

32:56.672 --> 32:58.640
Help!

32:58.708 --> 33:01.376
Thank God he's still here.

33:01.443 --> 33:02.977
Yep.

33:03.045 --> 33:06.548
I'm gonna
crank this baby up to 11...

33:07.850 --> 33:09.984
Just in case we--

33:10.052 --> 33:12.053
- I'm so cold.
- Myka...

33:12.121 --> 33:15.223
And I'm hungry.

33:15.291 --> 33:17.225
I need to eat.

33:18.895 --> 33:20.795
Aah!
Oh, it's happening to you.

33:20.863 --> 33:22.297
Aah!

33:24.633 --> 33:26.568
Myka, snap out of it.
Myka!

33:28.904 --> 33:30.238
You all ate Mexican?

33:36.812 --> 33:38.379
It's Pete.
Myka!

33:50.901 --> 33:52.568
Okay.
All right. Okay.

33:52.636 --> 33:54.937
Aah!

33:55.005 --> 33:56.706
Myka, don't hate me
for this, but...

34:06.151 --> 34:07.919
Keys--
no keys.

34:17.585 --> 34:21.021
What the...?

34:21.089 --> 34:23.956
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

34:27.561 --> 34:30.262
Okay, breathe.
Breathe slowly, Claudia.

34:30.330 --> 34:32.630
Breathe.
It's okay.

34:32.697 --> 34:34.699
No, it's not, okay?

34:34.766 --> 34:37.168
Everything is not okay.

34:37.235 --> 34:40.638
Some psycho has the Warehouse
in his sights.

34:40.706 --> 34:43.842
My best friend
wants nothing to do with me.

34:43.909 --> 34:46.078
And now the Sultan of Suckwad
over there

34:46.146 --> 34:47.746
is trying to kill me.

34:47.813 --> 34:50.349
Oh, yeah, it's all rainbows
and unicorns.

34:50.417 --> 34:52.485
And on top of that,
why am I dry?

34:52.552 --> 34:54.887
It's an artifact, Claudia.

34:54.955 --> 34:55.888
Watch.

34:57.758 --> 34:59.925
Sallah,
what will I have for dinner?

35:06.232 --> 35:09.534
"That blemish
is probably cancer."

35:09.602 --> 35:11.336
What the hell kind of fortune
is that?

35:11.404 --> 35:12.937
Sallah's not
a fortune-teller.

35:13.005 --> 35:14.539
He's more of a hypnotist.

35:14.607 --> 35:17.742
He instills
an overwhelming feeling of dread

35:17.810 --> 35:20.612
into anyone who activates him.

35:20.680 --> 35:23.949
Okay,
so how do I beat him, then?

35:24.017 --> 35:26.118
You have
to actively ignore him.

35:26.186 --> 35:28.187
Like I do with Artie?

35:28.255 --> 35:29.956
Yep.

35:30.024 --> 35:32.025
So I'm not gonna die?

35:32.093 --> 35:34.294
Not on Sallah's timetable
anyway.

35:37.198 --> 35:38.699
Yeah?

35:38.767 --> 35:43.737
Claudia, I need you to hack
into the Ithaca power grid!

35:43.805 --> 35:46.139
Do it now!
I'm about to become dinner.

35:46.206 --> 35:47.740
O-okay, doing it.

35:47.808 --> 35:48.908
Nope.

35:52.678 --> 35:53.878
Okay, I'm in.
Now what?

35:53.946 --> 35:55.113
All right,
they're sensitive to light.

35:55.181 --> 35:57.348
Can you--can you make it bright
out here?

35:57.416 --> 36:00.251
Say no more.
Here comes the sun.

36:22.344 --> 36:24.445
Manny, you open this door.

36:24.513 --> 36:25.880
How do I know
you're not one of them?

36:30.318 --> 36:32.319
Damn, the circuits blew.

36:38.993 --> 36:40.460
Manny!

36:40.528 --> 36:43.029
Open the door,
or they're gonna eat me alive!

36:46.734 --> 36:48.401
What the hell is going on?
What's wrong with those people?

36:48.469 --> 36:50.336
Something in this truck

36:50.404 --> 36:53.272
turned them into cannibals.

36:53.340 --> 36:56.175
So they spiked my tires
because they want to eat me?

37:02.149 --> 37:03.850
Where did you get this?

37:03.917 --> 37:07.053
Uh, I was hiking in Utah.
I saw it buried in the ground.

37:07.121 --> 37:08.888
I thought
it'd be a nice souvenir.

37:08.956 --> 37:11.925
Myka, put money in here.
Did those workers tip you?

37:11.993 --> 37:13.561
Yeah, I should've put it
out sooner.

37:13.628 --> 37:15.596
This is it.
This is the artifact.

37:15.664 --> 37:17.565
Damn it, I don't have
any static bags!

37:17.633 --> 37:18.933
What the hell's
a static bag?

37:21.603 --> 37:22.970
Oh, man, I'm not supposed
to do this!

37:23.038 --> 37:24.672
Cover your eyes!

37:36.583 --> 37:37.984
Myka?

37:38.052 --> 37:40.587
Please tell me
I didn't eat anyone.

37:42.590 --> 37:44.491
Okay.

37:47.895 --> 37:52.166
I don't know what you two did,
but nice work.

38:01.576 --> 38:05.011
In the winter of 1846, a caravan
of men, women, and children

38:05.079 --> 38:06.913
stranded in
the Sierra Nevada Mountains

38:06.981 --> 38:08.915
were forced to resort
to the most extreme measures

38:08.983 --> 38:11.351
just to survive.

38:11.418 --> 38:14.120
Somehow, the horrific ordeals
of the Donner party

38:14.187 --> 38:17.389
imbued an ordinary jar
with the power to make others

38:17.457 --> 38:18.957
experience
what they were suffering.

38:19.025 --> 38:20.993
And putting money
in the jar triggered it.

38:21.061 --> 38:24.264
- But why?
- Well, interesting sidebar--

38:24.331 --> 38:26.500
the jar was one of several

38:26.568 --> 38:28.235
the survivors used to bury
their money.

38:28.303 --> 38:30.638
Even in the grim shadow
of death...

38:30.706 --> 38:33.208
They were putting a little
something away for a rainy day.

38:34.777 --> 38:36.645
Where's Pete?

38:36.713 --> 38:39.147
Oh, he's waiting for us
at the Univille Diner.

38:39.215 --> 38:42.350
It's all-you-can-eat pancakes.
Breakfast is on him.

38:42.418 --> 38:44.085
Fine, but he's leaving
his own damn tip.

39:14.742 --> 39:16.042
I'll be right back.
Thank you.

39:19.612 --> 39:22.180
So, for our opening number,

39:22.248 --> 39:24.849
I'm thinking either Hole
or The Clash.

39:24.917 --> 39:26.984
I thought
you were <i>Marked For Death</i>.

39:27.052 --> 39:29.286
Yeah, no more
than anyone else, apparently.

39:31.556 --> 39:33.256
Listen, Dwayne,
this is the warning label

39:33.324 --> 39:35.558
on Claudia Donovan, okay?

39:35.626 --> 39:37.928
"Stuff happens to me...

39:37.995 --> 39:39.196
A lot--

39:39.264 --> 39:40.998
sometimes weird stuff,
sometimes bad stuff,

39:41.066 --> 39:43.200
but it puts things
in perspective.

39:43.268 --> 39:46.537
I never know what fresh hell
tomorrow's gonna bring.

39:46.605 --> 39:50.275
So, if you still want me
to join your band,

39:50.343 --> 39:52.812
um...

39:54.448 --> 39:55.982
Then let's rock.

39:57.785 --> 40:00.386
I'm gonna finish this set,
all right?

40:00.454 --> 40:02.989
- Just don't move.
- Right here.

40:14.570 --> 40:16.404
Mm, hey.
One more, hold the water.

40:26.650 --> 40:28.851
Your card's been declined.

40:28.919 --> 40:31.120
Son of a...

40:31.188 --> 40:33.122
They cut off
my credit line, too.

40:33.190 --> 40:35.491
Whatever. Look, I'm gonna need
you to settle your tab.

40:35.558 --> 40:37.092
Put it on mine.

40:37.160 --> 40:39.595
And, uh, give me one
of the same.

40:40.997 --> 40:42.865
Oh, hey...

40:42.933 --> 40:46.235
Thanks, but I don't need--

40:46.303 --> 40:48.837
Come on.
I've been there, trust me.

40:48.905 --> 40:52.141
We could all use
a friend sometimes, right?

40:54.177 --> 40:56.011
All right, well...

40:58.248 --> 40:59.615
- Thanks.
- Anytime...

40:59.683 --> 41:01.550
Steve.

41:04.654 --> 41:06.188
Have we met before?

41:06.256 --> 41:08.024
Almost.

41:08.092 --> 41:10.727
A couple weeks back,
down in Atlanta.

41:10.794 --> 41:12.061
You're with Stukowski.

41:12.129 --> 41:14.231
She's not longer with us,
unfortunately.

41:14.298 --> 41:16.166
Bit of a wild card.

41:16.234 --> 41:19.069
- Sally liked you.
- Yeah, well, I'm...

41:19.137 --> 41:20.804
Agent Steve Jinks--

41:20.872 --> 41:22.773
former A.T.F.,
former Warehouse 13,

41:22.841 --> 41:24.842
now burned by Mrs. Frederic
and the Regents

41:24.909 --> 41:27.178
because you dared
to have scruples.

41:27.245 --> 41:29.880
No career, no prospects,
no future...

41:29.948 --> 41:32.516
I know what they did.

41:32.584 --> 41:34.118
Now who are you?
What do you want?

41:34.185 --> 41:37.755
Marcus Diamond,
and, uh, we want you, Steve.

41:37.822 --> 41:39.924
- You people are murderers.
- No, no, no.

41:39.992 --> 41:42.560
We defend ourselves.

41:42.628 --> 41:46.363
Besides, you saw what your
former friends are capable of.

41:48.400 --> 41:50.167
- Come work with me.
- And why would I work for you?

41:50.235 --> 41:52.436
Besides not having to rely
on the kindness of strangers

41:52.504 --> 41:54.638
to cover you bar tabs...

41:54.706 --> 41:56.607
You're good.

41:56.674 --> 41:58.509
You should be working
with the kind of people

41:58.576 --> 42:00.210
who can appreciate
a man of your talents.

42:04.650 --> 42:06.317
But...

42:08.486 --> 42:10.887
Obviously,
you are not interested.

42:13.924 --> 42:17.193
Well, good luck, Steve.

42:18.386 --> 42:20.086
Marcus.
