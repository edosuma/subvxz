17:41.147 --> 17:42.583
- I'll take the briefcase now.

17:42.626 --> 17:44.585
- Oh, finally.

17:44.628 --> 17:47.718
Might I suggest using a handcuff
with a fabric inner lining?

17:47.762 --> 17:48.850
It prevents chafing.

17:55.204 --> 17:56.684
Wait.

17:56.727 --> 17:58.599
Don't you want whatever's inside
of there?

17:58.642 --> 18:00.383
- There's nothing inside there.

18:00.427 --> 18:02.472
- Nothing? Then why did you have
me guard it all day?

18:02.516 --> 18:04.953
- It's well-known throughout the
private security industry

18:04.996 --> 18:07.042
that you cause more harm than
good

18:07.086 --> 18:08.957
when left to your own
devices.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.089
- What do you mean by that?

18:10.132 --> 18:11.655
- I needed you occupied

18:11.699 --> 18:13.483
so I could properly protect Miss
Margulies.

18:13.527 --> 18:15.659
- Hold on just a second.

18:15.703 --> 18:20.708
You wasted my entire day
guarding an empty briefcase?

18:20.751 --> 18:22.623
- Yes, but it was a job well
done.

18:23.928 --> 18:25.843
- It was a job well done?

18:25.887 --> 18:27.845
- Yes, Miss Margulies and I
thank you for your service.

18:27.889 --> 18:30.761
- [chuckles]
You're welcome.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.720
And you're welcome,
Miss Margulies.

18:32.763 --> 18:35.157
[chuckles] I'm happy to be a
part of the team.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.727
- Hats off to you, Staci.

18:39.770 --> 18:41.424
This is a wonderful idea.
- Thank you, Davis.

18:41.468 --> 18:43.122
- It's brilliant,
just brilliant.

18:43.165 --> 18:45.298
- Are you ready to unbox me?

18:45.341 --> 18:48.518
- I'm ready.
- Staci, this is awesome.

18:48.562 --> 18:50.825
Thank you.
This is exactly the kind of

18:50.868 --> 18:52.870
entrance I deserve.

18:52.914 --> 18:54.394
Oh, and by the way...
- Yeah.

18:54.437 --> 18:57.048
- If you're still into the
dolphin fucking,

18:57.092 --> 18:59.529
I know a lot of ex-cons down in
St. Barts

18:59.573 --> 19:01.227
that can totally make that
happen for you.

19:01.270 --> 19:03.142
- Okay, I don't fuck dolphins.

19:03.185 --> 19:06.928
- Honey...
- Okay, hook me up.

19:06.971 --> 19:08.408
Oh, my gosh.

19:08.451 --> 19:10.018
Look at this.
Look at this.

19:10.061 --> 19:11.889
- Ahh.
- Good luck, Julianna.

19:11.933 --> 19:14.022
Pretty and funny.
Pretty and funny.

19:14.065 --> 19:16.024
Oh, Davis, this is teamwork.

19:16.067 --> 19:17.721
- I'm glad I used the Infinity
System

19:17.765 --> 19:19.549
to bring the show to the
next level.

19:19.593 --> 19:23.336
- Oh...where's that switchblade?

19:23.379 --> 19:25.381
- I'm just waiting to follow
you.

19:25.425 --> 19:28.906
Can I?
- Of course, Penny.

19:28.950 --> 19:32.475
- You remembered to put airholes
in that box, right?

19:32.519 --> 19:33.998
- Oh, shit.

19:34.042 --> 19:35.609
Unbox her!
- Unbox her!

19:35.652 --> 19:37.176
- Unbox her!
- It's not safe!

19:37.219 --> 19:38.307
- Unbox her!

19:38.351 --> 19:41.702

19:48.056 --> 19:50.580
- Sweetie, can you please hand
me that brush

19:50.624 --> 19:52.452
on the makeup table?

19:52.495 --> 19:53.583
- Me?

19:53.627 --> 19:56.412
Uh--of course.

20:00.373 --> 20:02.288
- Hmm, excellent technique.

20:02.331 --> 20:03.550
I thank you.

20:03.593 --> 20:05.378
- I thank you.

20:12.776 --> 20:14.996
- Hey, kid.

20:15.039 --> 20:17.738
Catch.

20:17.781 --> 20:19.914
You'll need it when you get
called up to the big leagues.

20:23.483 --> 20:24.701
- Really?

20:24.745 --> 20:26.399
- Your time will come soon.
