experience with one woman.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.124

08:13.126 --> 08:15.293
relationships are
just trial and error.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.595
Like anniversaries.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.296
First I tried "don't remember,"

08:18.298 --> 08:19.998
then "remember too late,"

08:20.000 --> 08:23.168
then I happily settled on
"make Lisa remember."

08:23.170 --> 08:26.771

has never been better.

trial and error, eh?

the secret to women.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.157
Homer, scientific research

08:46.159 --> 08:48.793
can solve anything
except for cold fusion, quasars,

08:48.795 --> 08:51.963
the interior of black holes
and what preceded the big bang.

08:51.965 --> 08:56.134
But everything else can be
solved, including love.

08:57.804 --> 09:00.305
What makes a guy and a girl
click isn't science.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.140
It's chemistry!

09:02.142 --> 09:04.376
Which is science.
What?!

09:05.978 --> 09:08.880
See, I have asked an enormous
cross-section of women

09:08.882 --> 09:11.016
one single question--

09:11.018 --> 09:12.884
what attracts you
to a man?

09:12.886 --> 09:15.353
Let us listen and learn
and have some lemonade,

09:15.355 --> 09:17.322
which I just
squeezed nicely.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.390
(overlapping voices)

09:18.392 --> 09:19.991
...the most important
thing that I look for...

09:19.993 --> 09:22.060
I like it when
they're tall.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.029
Blue eyes!
Definitely
wants kids.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.264
Hmm, I didn't hear
the last one.

09:28.701 --> 09:31.670
First I'll replace
these Coke bottle glasses

09:31.672 --> 09:34.005

09:34.007 --> 09:35.740
Mm-hmm.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.842
Next, of course,
is shoe lifts for height.

09:37.844 --> 09:39.511
Make you much taller,
look down upon people.

09:39.513 --> 09:41.179
It's wonderful.
Whoa, whoa...

09:41.181 --> 09:43.014
Hey, look at me.
I'm Herman Munster!

09:43.016 --> 09:47.118
Actually, he had Lily,
who was quite a dish.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.423
So, do you, uh,
find me attractive?

09:51.425 --> 09:52.857
Sorry, but no.

09:52.859 --> 09:53.858
Oh, curse the luck!

09:53.860 --> 09:54.893
And this is an android

09:54.895 --> 09:57.062

nothing but "yes."

09:59.865 --> 10:00.932
Why? Why? Why?

10:03.537 --> 10:06.071
Uh, Professor...

10:06.073 --> 10:08.206

be your voice?

10:08.208 --> 10:09.941
Why, what's wrong

10:09.943 --> 10:12.077

10:12.079 --> 10:16.281

10:56.156 --> 10:57.622
(like Walter Cronkite):
to Walter Cronkite...

10:57.624 --> 10:59.257
(like Rush Limbaugh):
to Rush Limbaugh!

10:59.259 --> 11:00.959
(deep, sexy voice):
I don't agree with his politics,

11:00.961 --> 11:02.794
but his body
is a natural echo chamber.

11:02.796 --> 11:05.463
Wow. That does
change everything.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.432
You turned me on.

11:07.434 --> 11:10.001
Oh, it's time for
a little field test, I see.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.603
Any other advice, Homer?

11:11.605 --> 11:13.938
Yep-- hang out
at yoga classes.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.940
That's where
the ladies are.

11:15.942 --> 11:18.176
(normal voice): How would
you know about yoga class?

11:18.178 --> 11:21.012
Uh, I thought
it was yogurt class.

11:23.115 --> 11:25.850
Twenty-one!
Dealer wins again.

11:27.987 --> 11:30.689
Now, here's
our headliner, Dolly Parton.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.857
(banjo plays)

11:35.361 --> 11:37.362
Oh, she's good.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.130
Bart!

11:39.132 --> 11:40.165
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

11:40.167 --> 11:42.367
You're taking advantage
of these people

11:42.369 --> 11:44.135
who don't know
where they are.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.970
I'm taking them back
where they belong.

11:45.972 --> 11:47.372
Oh, no, you don't.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.641
He just comped me a suite!

11:49.643 --> 11:51.309
Fantastic!

11:51.311 --> 11:52.544
(clattering, thud)

11:55.381 --> 11:56.548
(meows)

11:56.550 --> 11:57.949
(gasps)

11:59.218 --> 12:01.820
You can't keep
pumping powerful drugs

12:01.822 --> 12:04.522
into people who can't
even bite into a peach.

12:04.524 --> 12:07.025
Mrs. Simpson,
it's a fact.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.393
If these seniors
aren't medicated,

12:08.395 --> 12:10.862
I can't binge-watch
<i>Boardwalk Empire.</i>

12:10.864 --> 12:12.564
Nucky dies at the end!

12:12.566 --> 12:14.365
Yeah, well, screw you.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.000
I'm going to report you
to the state.

12:16.002 --> 12:17.335
I really don't care.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.570
(groans)

12:18.572 --> 12:20.004
Wha...?

12:20.006 --> 12:21.372
You broke me.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.241
I'm going to say something
I've never said.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.976
How can I help you?

12:26.045 --> 12:27.712
Um, I'll wait outside

12:27.714 --> 12:29.581
'cause they might
make me do something.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.516
I've changed my height,
I've changed my eyes,

12:31.518 --> 12:32.917
my relationship status--

12:32.919 --> 12:35.520
I-I don't know why I put
"unavailable" there.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.355
That certainly
did not help matters.

12:37.357 --> 12:41.359
But now it is time
to change my voice...

12:41.361 --> 12:43.862
(clears throat):
<i>Oyce... Voy...</i>

12:43.864 --> 12:46.431
(deep, sexy voice):
And the <i>hoyvin</i> and the <i>flayvin</i>

12:46.433 --> 12:49.033
are now "hasta
la vista, Frinky."

12:49.035 --> 12:50.034
Ooh.
(hums)

12:50.036 --> 12:51.436
Mm...

12:51.438 --> 12:53.438
(chuckles softly)

12:53.440 --> 12:56.274
(scoffs)
I'm always next to the jerk

12:56.276 --> 12:58.042
who comes here
to meet women.

12:58.044 --> 12:59.210
Hey, look, I get you.

12:59.212 --> 13:01.546
You broke up with a long-
time high school boyfriend

13:01.548 --> 13:03.248
'cause he just wasn't
going anywhere.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.250
Then you play the field,
but it's all losers

13:05.252 --> 13:06.918
who just want
to take from you.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.453
Now you're just
hoping beyond hope

13:08.455 --> 13:10.121
for a man you can hug

13:10.123 --> 13:12.290
who'll organize
the wires behind your TV.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.758
And believe you me,
sweetheart,

13:13.760 --> 13:16.394
I can organize every
wire you have.

13:16.396 --> 13:19.097
Now I'd like to show you
a picture of my new puppy.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.899
Yeah, his name's...
(sneezes)

13:20.901 --> 13:21.900
(normal voice):
Logarithm.

13:21.902 --> 13:22.934
(clears throat)

13:22.936 --> 13:23.935
(deep, sexy voice):
I mean Larry.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.437
Aw...
Here's my number.

13:26.439 --> 13:29.073
And to prove
it's not a lie...

13:29.075 --> 13:30.642
(cell phone ringing)

13:30.644 --> 13:31.810
Yeah, baby.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.077
(both giggling)

13:33.079 --> 13:35.180
Call me!

13:36.315 --> 13:38.449
Man, you're reading
page three

13:38.451 --> 13:39.651
and the next
thing you know,

13:39.653 --> 13:42.086
you're finishing
the last article, hmm.

13:42.088 --> 13:43.588
(normal voice):
I got all their numbers!

13:43.590 --> 13:44.956
Boy, you are smooth.

13:44.958 --> 13:45.957
Carl smooth.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.458
Now I'd better
get home.

13:47.460 --> 13:50.461
And in case Marge is mad,
can I borrow that chip?

13:50.463 --> 13:53.364
Oh, sure thing, pal.
I have extras.

13:55.434 --> 13:56.467
(sniffing)

13:56.469 --> 13:59.003
(low voice):
Chitter, chitter, baby.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.572
(chittering)

14:05.110 --> 14:06.444
I was so worried.

14:06.446 --> 14:07.679
Where have you been?

14:07.681 --> 14:08.947
No, don't tell me.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.115
I don't want to hear
one of your stupid lies.

14:11.117 --> 14:12.951
(deep voice):
Marge, my dear,

14:12.953 --> 14:16.120
you are the pork chop
with gravy on top.

14:16.122 --> 14:20.525
And I'm the applesauce that
brings out your flavor.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.227
Oh, Homie.

14:24.997 --> 14:26.197
(Homer coughs)

14:26.199 --> 14:28.199
(deep voice):
What the hell was that?

14:28.201 --> 14:29.367
(normal voice):
What the...?

14:29.369 --> 14:30.468
You're not my wife.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.804
Which I find intriguing.

14:32.806 --> 14:34.939
Suit yourself.
(laughs)

14:36.976 --> 14:39.010
So, Professor, tell me
all about last night.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.178
Dish-dish-dish!

14:40.180 --> 14:43.014
Uh, yes, well, I can't talk now.
I'm on a date.

14:43.016 --> 14:44.315
And then I have a date.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.885
And then another date.

14:46.887 --> 14:49.187
Is there such a thing as too
much of a good thing?

14:49.189 --> 14:50.989
This is my cousin,
Nookie Kwan.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.991
I'm number one on the east side.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.092
(quietly):
Oh, <i>gah-layvin.</i>

14:59.698 --> 15:00.665
Have any of you seen John Frink?

15:00.667 --> 15:01.532
He ain't here.

15:01.534 --> 15:02.667
But his hover-tronic

15:02.669 --> 15:05.003
Frink-a-ma-car
is parked outside.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.505
Hey, if I say he ain't
here, he ain't here.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.341
Hey, Moe, there's
a rat floating in my beer.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.510
It ain't there.

15:12.512 --> 15:13.511
(door closes)

15:13.513 --> 15:15.046
Thank you,
my good man,

15:15.048 --> 15:17.181
but, uh, I saw some
terrible things down there.

15:17.183 --> 15:20.251
Like for one,
Moe is pantsless.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.420
Hey, it's apron-only Tuesday.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.521
Oi...

15:23.523 --> 15:25.056
You're a lucky
guy, Frinky.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.591
Got all the chicks
you want

15:26.593 --> 15:28.092
while I can't find
a single woman

15:28.094 --> 15:31.195
to put up with me and my
domesticated wolverine.

15:31.197 --> 15:32.697
Lucky Frink.
I got nothin'.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.265
Some guys get
all the breaks.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.867
Let me see here.

15:35.869 --> 15:37.101
Uh, needy men...

15:37.103 --> 15:38.703
plus lonely women...

15:38.705 --> 15:40.738
I-I just bring them together!

15:40.740 --> 15:42.106
Hey, that's some
nice thinkin' there.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.208
Now, how 'bout a beer
and a baked potato.

15:44.210 --> 15:45.743
Ah, that sounds nice.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.645
We don't serve
baked potatoes.

15:49.048 --> 15:50.214
What happened?

15:50.216 --> 15:52.650
Everyone is incredibly
depressed.

15:56.221 --> 15:57.221
(groans)

15:57.223 --> 15:58.456
(sighs)

15:58.458 --> 16:00.124
(electronic sigh)

16:00.126 --> 16:02.126
I admit the hallucinations
were getting out of hand,

16:02.128 --> 16:03.895
so I stopped the meds.

16:03.897 --> 16:07.065
And hid them in the one place
they'll never look: the library.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.467
Well, there's one thing you
didn't count on--

16:09.469 --> 16:13.738
I go there because it's the only
room in this building with heat.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.406
(Marge gasps)

16:15.408 --> 16:18.743
Grampa, you're not allowed
to take dangerous drugs

16:18.745 --> 16:20.578
unless they're in
a little paper cup.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.280
Listen here.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.582
Every night I watch my roommate
cry himself to sleep.

16:24.584 --> 16:27.085
Yesterday I found out
it was a mirror!

16:27.087 --> 16:29.087
I'm gonna find my Mona!

16:29.089 --> 16:30.655
(grunting)

16:30.657 --> 16:33.691
There's a lesson here--
never visit Grampa.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.361
(gasps)

16:38.430 --> 16:40.765
My old car.

16:40.767 --> 16:43.768
Oh, that's some fine
hallucinatin'.

16:43.770 --> 16:47.372
To the good ol' days
before polio was cured!

16:48.474 --> 16:52.343
♪

17:02.988 --> 17:04.322
Hot diggity!

17:04.324 --> 17:06.524
It's America the way I liked it,

17:06.526 --> 17:09.894
before we went to the moon and
discovered how boring it was.

17:11.130 --> 17:12.797
(laughing)

17:12.799 --> 17:16.034
I found the one happy moment
in 80 years of life

17:16.036 --> 17:17.668
and I ain't leavin' it.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.637
Oh, this ain't right.

17:19.639 --> 17:20.638
(snaps)

17:20.640 --> 17:21.672
That's better!

17:21.674 --> 17:23.141
This ends right now!

17:23.143 --> 17:26.377
She's not real.
None of this is real.

17:26.379 --> 17:29.547
Imaginary cigarettes?
Nonexistent candy?

17:29.549 --> 17:31.015
(stammering)

17:31.017 --> 17:32.316
Get outta here, Marge!

17:32.318 --> 17:35.319
Unescorted women like you
aren't allowed in this era!

17:35.321 --> 17:37.321
I'm not getting out,
I'm cutting in.

17:37.323 --> 17:38.856
You can't live here.

17:38.858 --> 17:41.726
You have people in the real
world who love you.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.028
Two are standing
right over here.

17:44.030 --> 17:46.731
If you live in the past,
you'll never have us.

17:46.733 --> 17:50.001
And what's more precious to a
grampa than his grandchildren?

17:50.003 --> 17:53.004
Particularly
his grandson.

17:53.006 --> 17:56.574
Aw, your sexist argument
has won me over.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.843
We women will have our day.

17:58.845 --> 17:59.911
Attaboy.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.179
(groans)

18:01.181 --> 18:02.580
Good-bye, Mona.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.016
And good-bye, pack of
cigarettes for a quarter.

18:05.018 --> 18:07.985
I think I'll miss
you the most.

18:09.354 --> 18:11.089
(gasps)

18:11.091 --> 18:12.557
So what, uh...

18:12.559 --> 18:15.026
all that dancin' around
with me meant nothin'?

18:15.028 --> 18:18.529
(chuckles): Oh, I'll be back
to steal a kiss later.

18:18.531 --> 18:19.897
And as for you...

18:19.899 --> 18:22.366
I've got more
involved plans.

18:22.368 --> 18:24.102
(groans)

18:25.437 --> 18:28.106
So, Frink is finally going
to announce which woman

18:28.108 --> 18:31.442
he's chosen to be with at
the Springfield Planetarium.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.377
It's like an episode
of   <i>The Bachelor,</i>

18:33.379 --> 18:36.080
but you drive there and pay
six dollars for parking.

18:36.082 --> 18:39.250
Why are we both explaining it
if we all know what's happening?

18:39.252 --> 18:41.786
I like talking to you.

18:48.060 --> 18:50.394
(normal voice): Ladies,
please pay attention here.

18:50.396 --> 18:51.929
(groaning, murmuring)

18:51.931 --> 18:55.967
You see, I, uh... I thought I
was the only one who was lonely.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.970
But I have learned
that loneliness is everywhere,

18:58.972 --> 19:00.738
like superhero movies.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.674
How many times can Batman begin?

19:04.643 --> 19:06.444
I have reworked
my algorithms

19:06.446 --> 19:08.079
to make you not like <i>me,</i>

19:08.081 --> 19:12.083
but to find the man that will
make each of you happiest, yes.

19:12.085 --> 19:14.085
Uh, release the bachelors!

19:14.087 --> 19:16.154
I hope they enjoy it.

19:17.623 --> 19:18.923
(gasping)

19:18.925 --> 19:20.358
(impressed murmuring)

19:22.094 --> 19:23.828
Duffman would love
to be taught

19:23.830 --> 19:26.831
how to speak
in the first-person.

19:26.833 --> 19:27.832
(chuckling)

19:27.834 --> 19:29.433
Everyone's paired up.

19:29.435 --> 19:31.435
Almost everyone's
paired up.

19:31.437 --> 19:33.938
Professor,
what about you?

19:33.940 --> 19:35.106
Where's your match?

19:35.108 --> 19:38.609
For me, my true love
is intellectual conquest,

19:38.611 --> 19:40.945
the-the music of the spheres.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.180
(owl hooting)

19:42.182 --> 19:45.216
Well, sometimes it's good
just to be alone.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.720
I flushed the rest of the pills
down the toilet.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.389
Looks like they made their way
to the reservoir.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.491
We should really try to wake up.

20:27.493 --> 20:29.860
Are you kidding?
There's a full buffet

20:29.862 --> 20:31.162
and Dean Martin's here.

20:31.164 --> 20:32.530
Eh, that's
right, pally.

20:32.532 --> 20:33.831
Here, try the shrimp.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.334
Some have gone bad,
but, uh, most are fine.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.835
