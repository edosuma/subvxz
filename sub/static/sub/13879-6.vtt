00:35.046 --> 00:37.080
Carl, I'm gonna ask you
to examine this sword.

00:37.172 --> 00:39.773
Nothing unique or special
about the sword, nothing that

00:39.775 --> 00:42.042
indicates that it might
collapse at any time, or...

00:42.044 --> 00:43.810
It's, uh, yeah,
it's a real sword.

00:43.812 --> 00:46.146
No, Carl, no. Don't
encourage him.

00:46.148 --> 00:50.210
- Now check this out.
- Whoa. Pretty sharp.

00:50.212 --> 00:52.213
- Anything hidden in my hands?
- Nobody cares.

00:52.309 --> 00:54.509
Look in my mouth.
Ahhhh. Nothing.

00:54.597 --> 00:56.597
Now... watch this.

00:58.367 --> 01:01.168
It's stupid. He thinks it's cute.
It's gay.

01:01.170 --> 01:04.494
- His new name is gaywad.
- Oooh! Ta-da!

01:04.581 --> 01:07.883
- Whoa! Damn!
- Y'all wonder where it went?

01:07.913 --> 01:09.513
Yeah, I'd kind of like
to see where it...

01:09.534 --> 01:12.135
No, you don't. It's nothing
but a trick sword.

01:12.229 --> 01:13.943
See? Ohh!

01:14.622 --> 01:17.523
All right, that's fake
blood, so just disregard it.

01:17.525 --> 01:20.093
I know how this works. You
try to get me looking one

01:20.126 --> 01:22.559
way while you do another thing.
Where's the sword?

01:22.563 --> 01:25.831
Good question, Carl. Let's have a
cup of coffee and talk about it.

01:25.833 --> 01:27.015
Whoa-ah.

01:28.364 --> 01:30.882
Oh, God, he thinks
this is so cute.

01:30.884 --> 01:34.719
- Aah!
- It's not. It's fake coffee.

01:36.489 --> 01:39.157
Holy canoli, that was
frigging awesome!

01:39.177 --> 01:41.443
You want some foam with that?

01:41.445 --> 01:42.644
Ha ha ha! Yeah!

01:42.739 --> 01:45.440
- I mean, I ain't gonna drink it.
- I'll drink it.

01:45.442 --> 01:47.163
Those damn things are
9 bucks at the store.

01:47.247 --> 01:51.323
Don't forget to
tip your barista.

01:51.339 --> 01:53.572
That was so awesome!

01:53.612 --> 01:55.579
What happened to
the sword, though?

01:55.588 --> 01:56.788
What happened to the what?

01:56.832 --> 01:59.566
The sword. You did a
sword thing earlier.

01:59.568 --> 02:03.566
The sword, Meatwad! Come on, man!
I can't be doing this all day.

02:03.572 --> 02:05.472
Oh, the sword.

02:06.831 --> 02:08.497
Oh, yeah!

02:09.433 --> 02:11.767
- Voilа!
- Whoa! All right, man!

02:11.769 --> 02:12.601
Thank you.

02:12.655 --> 02:16.353
Fine! You finally got all the attention
you need to make it through the day.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.469
Wait a minute.

02:17.501 --> 02:19.201
This is an arrow.
These are all arrows!

02:19.280 --> 02:22.014
- So what?
- So, where's the sword?

02:22.016 --> 02:24.683
I don't... What... what sword?

02:24.685 --> 02:26.285
- Damn it.
- This is the third one this week!

02:26.287 --> 02:28.353
See?! I told you
he couldn't do it!

02:28.355 --> 02:31.256
Well, you swallow three
swords in a week.

02:31.258 --> 02:35.360
- You said you can do it.
- And I can do it because I taught you.

02:35.362 --> 02:39.264
Also, there's a really soft
coffee bean in my espresso.

02:39.364 --> 02:40.630
Hey, check out this trick.

02:40.723 --> 02:43.456
Well, I mean, it's more
like a biological problem.

02:43.475 --> 02:45.008
What are you gonna do with that?

02:45.094 --> 02:47.929
I'm gonna swallow it, blow
it out my nose, and then

02:48.015 --> 02:51.416
run it back and forth until
someone politely asks me to stop.

02:51.418 --> 02:53.185
Come on. You can't do that.

02:53.187 --> 02:54.653
- I bet I can.
- I bet you can't.

02:54.655 --> 02:57.556
- Well, I bet I can.
- I kind of wish you wouldn't.

02:57.558 --> 02:59.591
- I bet you can't!
- I bet I can!

02:59.593 --> 03:00.592
No, you can't!

03:00.594 --> 03:02.361
How much you want to bet, cup?

03:02.363 --> 03:07.295
I got 5 hundy, fat man, and it says that
you can't do that thing you proposed.

03:07.301 --> 03:08.233
All right, drink cup.

03:08.235 --> 03:09.701
So, we're doing this
on credit, right?

03:09.703 --> 03:10.669
That's right.

03:10.671 --> 03:11.803
Shake, look... why

03:11.805 --> 03:14.273
would he do this if he hadn't
done it a bunch of times before?

03:14.275 --> 03:15.807
But we don't know that, do we?

03:15.809 --> 03:18.410
I'm just telling you not to
bet money you don't have.

03:19.280 --> 03:20.646
Look, this is an easy win.

03:20.648 --> 03:22.814
There's no way he can do that
thing he says he's gonna do.

03:23.717 --> 03:25.450
I call it "mental floss."

03:25.452 --> 03:29.221
Back in the '80s, you know,
when they used to cut blow with

03:29.223 --> 03:32.624
bleach... sinus cavity back
here... freaking gone, man.

03:32.626 --> 03:34.259
Ugh. Put it away, please, Carl.

03:34.261 --> 03:35.360
Don't put it back on y...

03:35.362 --> 03:36.261
Oh, he did it. Ohh.

03:36.263 --> 03:39.431
I'd like to see you do that
again... for double or nothing!

03:39.433 --> 03:41.533
He's already done
it once, Shake!

03:41.535 --> 03:44.436
So, what are the chances
he can do it again?

03:44.438 --> 03:47.673
- They're astronomical, you fool!
- Jackpot!

03:47.675 --> 03:49.708
Come on, drink cup.
Come with me.

03:49.710 --> 03:53.608
As it turns out, my fingers were
crossed, thus negating the bet.

03:54.415 --> 03:57.716
Aaaah! Ow! Oh-ho-ho-ho. Aah!

03:57.718 --> 04:00.185
Now's the time where you
give him the money.

04:00.187 --> 04:02.120
I don't know what to say here.

04:02.122 --> 04:03.889
I mean, you can't get
blood out of a stone!

04:03.891 --> 04:04.756
Oh, yeah?

04:04.758 --> 04:06.258
Show him, Dante.

04:12.499 --> 04:15.400
- I got double or nothing says you...
- He didn't say that!

04:15.402 --> 04:17.101
You guys take credit
cards, right?

04:17.103 --> 04:19.271
Of course you don't.

04:19.273 --> 04:20.539
I'll just hit the ATM down the

04:20.541 --> 04:22.908
street and probably a couple
of other ones on the way.

04:22.910 --> 04:24.576
That was irresponsible,

04:24.578 --> 04:27.312
uneducated, and immature
what you did back there!

04:27.314 --> 04:29.481
Yeah, Meatwad. He's
talking directly to you.

04:29.483 --> 04:33.118
- No one takes that tone with me!
- No, I'm talking to you, Shake.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.683
You owe me $1,000, and, oh, yeah,
man, you're gonna pay it off.

04:35.689 --> 04:37.322
You're gonna work
it off with chores.

04:37.324 --> 04:38.223
All right.

04:38.225 --> 04:41.627
If that's the way it's gonna be,
I guess I got a lawn to mow.

04:42.429 --> 04:45.864
Huh. I guess I did
make an impact.

04:45.866 --> 04:47.833
Don't know why he's got
the TV out there, though.

04:47.835 --> 04:49.501
He hate to miss his shows.

04:49.503 --> 04:51.703
It's not even plugged in.
Huh. Weird.

04:51.705 --> 04:53.739
Can you get me some water?

04:53.741 --> 04:55.173
I think I did it wrong.

04:55.175 --> 04:57.909
- This is not worth $1,000.
- Fine.

04:57.911 --> 05:00.646
We'll go with the
initial offer of $40.

05:00.648 --> 05:02.481
I make my money work for me.

05:02.483 --> 05:04.416
What do all those numbers mean?

05:04.418 --> 05:05.751
Is that all the money I can win?

05:05.753 --> 05:08.650
Oh, yeah, yeah. That's how it works.
So, you like football?

05:08.656 --> 05:10.188
Oh, sure. I love that one.

05:10.190 --> 05:12.724
The college guys who wear helmets
to protect their brains.

05:12.726 --> 05:15.560
Hey, hey! We got a
football fan over here.

05:15.562 --> 05:20.332
What the hell are you doing here?
This is <i>my </i> get-rich-quick scheme!

05:20.334 --> 05:21.833
I'm just here to
play the odds, man.

05:21.835 --> 05:23.802
Well, you're about to
meet the wizard of odds!

05:23.804 --> 05:26.838
And I don't even know what that means,
but I know I-it's gonna suck... for you!

05:26.840 --> 05:31.406
Okay, I'll go with any team with the
color purple on their tube socks.

05:31.412 --> 05:34.846
- And I want to let it ride.
- That's safe. Very smart.

05:34.848 --> 05:36.915
What about you, drink cup?
You want to make a bet?

05:36.917 --> 05:40.581
Triple or nothing that Meatwad's
eaten by a pack of bees!

05:40.587 --> 05:43.955
Yeah. Sure. 100-to-1 odds.

05:43.957 --> 05:46.591
Hey, look at that.
They'll take the bet.

05:46.593 --> 05:49.661
That's right. I'm
in control here.

05:49.663 --> 05:53.661
Ohhhh! Ahhhh! It was a fluke!
Aaaaaah!

05:53.667 --> 05:57.703
Bees lay eggs in him constantly!
Aaaah!

05:57.705 --> 06:01.273
- Why don't you break some of <i>his</i> stuff?!
- They don't break my fingers.

06:01.275 --> 06:03.542
They buy me a free meal
is what they do for me.

06:03.544 --> 06:06.311
That's what you do when you
go color purple 8-for-8, boy!

06:06.313 --> 06:08.447
- Yeah, there he is.
- Fine.

06:08.449 --> 06:11.550
Dante, please extend me some
credit so that I, too, might be

06:11.552 --> 06:14.519
able to bet on the sporting
event where the guy did jail

06:14.521 --> 06:16.688
time for bringing the
gun into the club.

06:16.690 --> 06:18.657
Hey, hey, hey. Watch it.

06:18.659 --> 06:21.626
You got a constitutional
right to bear arms.

06:21.628 --> 06:22.627
In a dance club.

06:22.629 --> 06:25.564
I don't know if this is
your day, drink cup.

06:25.566 --> 06:27.399
If I was you, I'd take
a seat on the bench.

06:27.401 --> 06:29.701
- Watch the pros play.
- I thought you had a system!

06:29.703 --> 06:33.038
Yeah, I do. I put the time in, I
did the research, I watched that

06:33.040 --> 06:35.407
Oprah Winfrey movie, and
then I bet based on it.

06:35.409 --> 06:37.609
I want 20 grand on all
purple-sock teams!

06:37.611 --> 06:41.913
Purple? The vibes I'm getting are orange...
from the fruit cup I just had.

06:41.915 --> 06:44.883
Well, when the crowd
zigs, master Shake zags.

06:44.885 --> 06:48.386
How about you move my, uh,
$250 to the orange-sock

06:48.388 --> 06:50.722
teams, too, just for... just for kicks?

06:50.724 --> 06:53.291
- Yeah! All right!
- Up top!

06:53.293 --> 06:54.359
Give me some! Yeah!

06:54.361 --> 06:56.762
What's it mean when they say
they're gonna show me power tools?

06:56.764 --> 06:58.697
- No, no, no, no, no.
- We're not here together.

06:58.699 --> 07:01.329
I mean, does that mean they're
gonna make me work construction?

07:01.335 --> 07:02.267
I don't know you.

07:02.269 --> 07:06.400
If that's the case, I don't understand
why they wouldn't just say,
"we're gonna have you build some stuff."

07:06.406 --> 07:10.041
- Please stand over there, kind sir.
- Carl, I'm asking you first.

07:10.043 --> 07:13.745
All I need is just a
little bit of money.

07:13.747 --> 07:16.982
Don't make me do that thing you did
at the Taco Barn, 'cause I'll do it.

07:16.984 --> 07:19.796
Knock yourself out.
Your funeral.

07:23.390 --> 07:24.990
Ohhhh!

07:24.992 --> 07:27.926
Why did you just mop this floor?

07:27.928 --> 07:30.295
Ohh! I'm gonna have to sue you!

07:30.297 --> 07:33.431
How long's it take for the
out-of-court settlement?

07:33.433 --> 07:38.299
At Taco Barn, they... they
make me sign something and
they give me a free chimichanga.

07:38.305 --> 07:41.606
- Come on, pal. We got to go.
- Well, it's about damn time!

07:41.608 --> 07:43.942
Now, who do I speak to about
the free chimichanga?

07:43.944 --> 07:48.079
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Dante, you
need be careful over here.

07:48.081 --> 07:50.549
Someone just mopped.

07:50.551 --> 07:52.484
Aaaaaah!

07:52.486 --> 07:53.919
You might want to say goodbye.

07:53.921 --> 07:55.086
Let's do this quick.

07:55.088 --> 07:57.856
Meatman's picking greyhounds now.
He's freaking rolling in it.

07:57.858 --> 08:00.892
Wait. I mean, you
guys have been...

08:00.894 --> 08:03.595
- been winning all day.
- Yeah, I know.

08:03.597 --> 08:04.930
Awesome, right?
What's your point?

08:04.932 --> 08:06.565
I just thought maybe

08:06.567 --> 08:08.934
you could see fit to throw
a few bucks my way.

08:08.936 --> 08:12.370
Yeah, see, my funds right
now... they're tied up in

08:12.372 --> 08:14.406
the long-term
equities, you know?

08:14.408 --> 08:18.543
- The Nikkei index just closed.
- No, I totally understand that.

08:18.545 --> 08:20.412
All my money's over there, too.

08:20.414 --> 08:23.481
Otherwise, I wouldn't even ask.
Damn asian markets!

08:23.483 --> 08:24.916
So, we're good here,
right... we're done?

08:24.918 --> 08:27.819
Do you think... you could
bring those fingers to

08:27.821 --> 08:31.022
- Frylock to prove that I'm alive?
- Yeah, sure.

08:31.024 --> 08:33.525
Technically, this don't
prove nothing, though.

08:33.527 --> 08:36.461
Dante said once they close,
he's gonna take me down

08:36.462 --> 08:38.496
to the bridge to watch
the sun go down.

08:38.498 --> 08:42.467
He's been mean to me all day, so
this is a pretty nice change.

08:42.469 --> 08:44.669
Hey, when do I get my
new cement sneakers?

08:44.671 --> 08:47.505
That's a waste of cement.
We don't do that anymore.

08:47.507 --> 08:49.875
The water's only a couple
of inches deep anyways.

08:49.877 --> 08:51.910
Oh, good. I could've drowned.

08:51.912 --> 08:53.378
- Aaah!
- Oh, here we go.

08:53.380 --> 08:56.114
- You're gonna fly.
- Dante, hold up. Hold up.

08:56.116 --> 08:59.084
- Aaah!
- How deep is he into you guys?

08:59.086 --> 09:00.685
Uh, about 140 large.

09:00.687 --> 09:05.586
And what is the currency exchange
rate between larges and thousands?

09:05.592 --> 09:06.558
One to one.

09:06.560 --> 09:08.026
Whew! Goodness.

09:08.028 --> 09:10.862
- Here.
- Aaaaah!

09:10.864 --> 09:12.631
I'm good for it.

09:12.633 --> 09:14.933
Here's a little
whipped cream on top.

09:14.935 --> 09:16.568
Buy something for
that girl of yours.

09:16.570 --> 09:19.033
Tell her to keep that motor clean...
you know what I'm saying?

09:19.039 --> 09:20.839
It's your lucky day, fruit cup.

09:20.841 --> 09:24.175
Then how come I lost all them
damn bets, huh, you dumb Guinea?

09:24.177 --> 09:26.177
What's that, cup?
Say that again?

09:26.179 --> 09:29.114
Somebody bend my fingers
into a fist so I can

09:29.116 --> 09:32.050
show this old greaseball how
we do it in the old country!

09:32.052 --> 09:34.185
Say that again, cup!
Say it to my face!

09:34.187 --> 09:36.755
- Dante, please.
- Just disregard the cup.

09:36.757 --> 09:39.691
He's out of sorts today.
Here... for your trouble.

09:39.693 --> 09:41.660
Yeah, yeah, that's what I thought.
Thank you.

09:41.662 --> 09:44.996
Finally, the bank shows up. What
the hell took you so long?!

09:44.998 --> 09:47.098
Carl, tap his kneecaps.

09:47.100 --> 09:52.537
No, no, no, no, no! Ooooooh!
What was that about?!

09:52.539 --> 09:55.473
You remember that sword
trick I used to do... the

09:55.475 --> 09:57.709
one that you said that
you're so good at?

09:57.711 --> 10:00.512
Yeah. Too bad we don't
have a sword here.

10:00.514 --> 10:04.115
- Otherwise, I'd probably just do it.
- No, I bet you can't.

10:04.117 --> 10:08.620
- I bet I can!
- Well, looky, looky.

10:08.622 --> 10:11.623
Uh... well, the
wind's not right.

10:11.625 --> 10:15.460
I mean, let's see if the weather
calms down in the next couple days.

10:15.462 --> 10:18.663
No, I think we should do
this now, 'cause I bet

10:18.665 --> 10:21.066
you 140 larges that you
can't swallow this.

10:21.068 --> 10:23.835
Fine. Watch. And learn.

10:28.508 --> 10:32.644
Aaah! There. You happy?

10:32.646 --> 10:35.246
Well, I'll be damned. I
guess you did show me.

10:35.248 --> 10:37.649
Yeah. I'll see you nerds later.

10:39.619 --> 10:44.756
Help me up, bitch.
Then I'm out of here.
