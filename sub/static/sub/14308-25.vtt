00:09.275 --> 00:11.510
- Students, here are the names

00:11.544 --> 00:13.779
Of those who made
varsity scare team.

00:13.813 --> 00:17.616
And this is a picture
of the disco ball I'm selling.

00:17.650 --> 00:21.754
Mother says dancing
is for naughty boys.

00:23.456 --> 00:25.257
- Oh, man, the list is out.

00:25.291 --> 00:27.659
Hey, go see if I made the team.
I can't do it.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.628
- Look at you all nervous...

00:29.662 --> 00:33.499
Just like me when yoga club
was posted.

00:38.138 --> 00:40.806
No way.
Louie, great news!

00:40.840 --> 00:44.343
- Are you serious?
I made the team?

00:44.377 --> 00:47.179
- Oh, I don't know about that.

00:47.213 --> 00:50.549
But how long have I been talking
about getting a disco ball?

00:56.756 --> 00:59.658
- I didn't make it.
- Join the club, my friend.

00:59.692 --> 01:01.460
- You guys didn't make it
either?

01:01.494 --> 01:04.396
That's...

01:04.431 --> 01:07.499
How could I not make it?

01:07.534 --> 01:10.736
- Oh, look, I'm at the top
of the list--shocking.

01:10.770 --> 01:12.471
Remove my glasses
so I can gaze

01:12.505 --> 01:16.208
Upon those unworthy
of making the team.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.844
Guys, look, just 'cause you
didn't make the scare team,

01:18.878 --> 01:20.813
Don't think
you aren't a good ghost.

01:20.847 --> 01:23.582
Know it, losers!

01:23.616 --> 01:27.219
Unnecessary jacket change!

01:27.253 --> 01:29.354
- I know king's the most
powerful ghost in school,

01:29.389 --> 01:30.823
But he's such a jerk.

01:30.857 --> 01:32.658
- Yeah, well, he's lucky

01:32.692 --> 01:36.128
He's not going up
against louie preston.

01:37.464 --> 01:39.698
- Oh, am I lucky?

01:46.806 --> 01:48.140
[laughter]

01:48.174 --> 01:49.808
- Real lucky.

01:51.177 --> 01:54.379
[spooky rock music]

01:54.414 --> 01:56.682
- ♪ don't know
how we ended up this way ♪

01:56.716 --> 01:58.317
- ♪ but I guess
you could call us ♪

01:58.351 --> 02:00.752
- ♪ the haunted hathaways

02:05.391 --> 02:06.892
- What's up, little man?

02:06.926 --> 02:09.495
Just getting ready for
my fishing trip with the guys.

02:09.529 --> 02:13.232
It's gonna be on the hook.

02:13.266 --> 02:15.834
Hook, fishing...

02:15.869 --> 02:18.637
What's going on, son?

02:18.671 --> 02:20.305
- I didn't make the scare team.

02:20.340 --> 02:22.407
It's official--
I'm a terrible ghost.

02:22.442 --> 02:24.743
- Don't say that.
You're a great ghost.

02:24.777 --> 02:29.414
- During tryouts I turned
myself into a lima bean.

02:29.449 --> 02:33.352
- It is the scariest bean...

02:33.386 --> 02:37.689
- Let's face it--I'd be better
off being a pro golfer.

02:40.426 --> 02:43.595
- Oh, mommy!

02:43.630 --> 02:46.765
- Oh, did I get you?

02:46.799 --> 02:50.736
- Listen, son,
put away the club.

02:50.770 --> 02:52.738
You're gonna get
there one day.

02:52.772 --> 02:55.874
You just have to have
confidence and focus.

02:55.909 --> 02:58.777
- Louie, a parade
is coming down the street,

02:58.811 --> 03:02.347
And I have a whole basket
full of water balloons.

03:02.382 --> 03:04.616
- I don't feel like it.
I'm out of here.

03:06.319 --> 03:08.287
- What's wrong with louie?

03:08.321 --> 03:11.256
- He's upset he didn't make
his school's scare team.

03:11.291 --> 03:14.259
- Poor little guy.
I hate to see him hurting.

03:14.294 --> 03:15.460
I wish there was something

03:15.495 --> 03:17.796
We could do to help lift
his spirits.

03:17.830 --> 03:20.699
- You know, frankie,
underneath that hard edge,

03:20.733 --> 03:23.869
You're just a caring,
little sweetheart, aren't ya?

03:23.903 --> 03:28.207
- Ha!
Take that, you hippie!

03:28.241 --> 03:29.942
Sorry.
What were you saying?

03:35.949 --> 03:39.718
- Taylor, I stayed up all night,
but I finally did it.

03:39.752 --> 03:43.422
I baked the perfect chocolate
meringue pie for the pie wars.

03:43.456 --> 03:45.691
It's a contest to find
the best baker in new orleans.

03:45.725 --> 03:48.527
[yawns]
I am so pumped.

03:48.561 --> 03:49.828
[snores]
- mom!

03:49.862 --> 03:51.496
- I'm up! I'm up!

03:51.531 --> 03:53.131
Saved it!

03:56.869 --> 03:59.171
- Hey, tay.
I know what you're thinking.

03:59.205 --> 04:01.206
- That you're blocking my view
of kyle toms,

04:01.241 --> 04:02.774
The cutest boy in school?

04:02.809 --> 04:06.511
- Exactly. Something is missing
from my outfit.

04:06.546 --> 04:09.181
Care to guess what?
- Not now.

04:09.215 --> 04:10.649
I'm trying to flirt.

04:10.683 --> 04:13.518
- Right again.
It's a bow tie.

04:13.553 --> 04:15.387
I entered a sweepstakes
to win the bow tie

04:15.421 --> 04:17.356
Worn by bruce wayne
in <i>batman,</i>

04:17.390 --> 04:18.824
And I find out tomorrow
if I win.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.826
How cool is that?

04:20.860 --> 04:23.762
- Ugh. Isn't it the worst
when people don't notice you?

04:23.796 --> 04:26.431
Miles, why are you wearing
a tux?

04:29.736 --> 04:32.704
- Miss, the food was delightful.

04:32.739 --> 04:35.440
I'd like to give you
an extraordinary tip.

04:35.475 --> 04:37.175
- Oh, thank you.

04:37.210 --> 04:41.346
- May this charm bring you
all the luck you deserve.

04:41.381 --> 04:44.516
- Yay.
Fake money.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.654
A good-luck coin?

04:48.688 --> 04:50.689
This is worse than when mom
tried to pay me in hugs.

04:50.723 --> 04:53.292
- What? Getting paid in hugs
is the best.

04:53.326 --> 04:58.130
- Hi. I don't know your name
or anything about you,

04:58.164 --> 05:01.566
But I looked over here and saw
the cutest girl I've ever seen.

05:01.601 --> 05:04.202
- Where?

05:04.237 --> 05:05.671
Oh.

05:05.705 --> 05:07.506
- Do you want to go
to a movie tomorrow?

05:07.540 --> 05:09.341
I could swing by here
around 7:00.

05:09.375 --> 05:11.109
- Sounds good.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.111
Miles,
how did that just happen?

05:13.146 --> 05:15.547
[gasps]
it's the coin!

05:15.581 --> 05:17.849
- What? Some kid asks you out,

05:17.884 --> 05:19.785
And you think
it's because of a stupid charm?

05:19.819 --> 05:21.219
- Uh, duh.

05:23.690 --> 05:26.758
Mom.
- [snores] saved it!

05:29.696 --> 05:33.265
- Okay, I'm off
to my fly-fishing trip.

05:33.299 --> 05:35.701
Or should I say
my super-fly fishing trip.

05:35.735 --> 05:38.203
[laughs]

05:38.237 --> 05:40.706
I'm gonna stop
doing those now.

05:40.740 --> 05:43.642
- I think that's for the best.

05:43.676 --> 05:47.312
- Louie, take off that hat.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.613
Chin up, buddy.

05:48.648 --> 05:50.282
Your time is gonna come...

05:50.316 --> 05:52.150
Maybe sooner than you think.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.885
See you guys tomorrow.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.657
- Ray's right.
You should just keep practicing.

05:58.691 --> 06:01.860
In fact, can you turn on
that lamp for me?

06:03.529 --> 06:04.863
- What's the point?

06:04.897 --> 06:06.598
I'd probably end up giving
the peacock

06:06.632 --> 06:08.233
A handlebar mustache.

06:08.267 --> 06:10.369
- Come on.

06:11.704 --> 06:14.673
You did it!
You turned on the lamp...

06:14.707 --> 06:18.510
And also gave the peacock
a handlebar mustache.

06:18.544 --> 06:20.512
- Probably just
beginner's luck.

06:20.546 --> 06:23.382
- Maybe, maybe not.
Try slamming the door.

06:26.185 --> 06:27.819
[door slams]

06:27.854 --> 06:29.654
- Frankie,
I just slammed the door

06:29.689 --> 06:32.224
Without turning
into a piece of fruit!

06:32.258 --> 06:33.425
- Try something bigger.

06:33.459 --> 06:35.327
How about levitating the couch?

06:35.361 --> 06:37.262
- Okay, here goes...

06:39.499 --> 06:42.801
No way!
I did it! I did it!

06:42.835 --> 06:46.071
Whoo-hoo!
I'm the man!

06:46.105 --> 06:48.807
- Great job.
A little help, please?

06:48.841 --> 06:52.144
- You guys doubted me,
but through all the hard times,

06:52.178 --> 06:54.146
I never lost faith
in myself.

06:54.180 --> 06:57.249
- Louie.
- You know, the term "superstar"

06:57.283 --> 06:59.818
Is often overused,
but in my case--

06:59.852 --> 07:03.822
- Louie, lift the couch.
- Oh, sorry.

07:03.856 --> 07:06.158
- [breathing heavily]

07:06.192 --> 07:07.426
- This is awesome.

07:07.460 --> 07:09.594
I can't wait
for school tomorrow.

07:13.199 --> 07:16.134
- Okay, the coast is clear.

07:16.169 --> 07:17.769
Nice job with the tricks, ray.

07:17.804 --> 07:19.805
You made louie look like
an awesome ghost.

07:19.839 --> 07:23.408
- Eh, hopefully it gave him the
boost of confidence he needed.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.843
You know, it does feel good

07:24.877 --> 07:27.512
To help someone,
though, right, frankie?

07:27.547 --> 07:30.348
Frankie?

07:30.383 --> 07:32.584
- Ha ha!
Direct hit!

07:34.220 --> 07:35.787
Sorry.
What were you saying?

07:35.822 --> 07:37.355
- Never mind.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.758
I'll see you when I get back.

07:42.829 --> 07:45.163
- Francesca, a moment.

07:51.838 --> 07:54.306
- Whoa.
That was close.

07:54.340 --> 07:57.442
- No, that was lucky.

07:57.477 --> 08:01.680
- [sighs] all this coin stuff
is such nonsense.

08:09.222 --> 08:11.890
That was so batman.

08:16.729 --> 08:19.097
- I'm so sorry.

08:19.131 --> 08:21.166
- Taylor, are you okay?

08:21.200 --> 08:24.603
- I thought my coin
brought only good luck--

08:24.637 --> 08:26.104
Wait. It's gone.
Where'd it go?

08:26.138 --> 08:28.874
- Oh, yes!
My lucky day!

08:32.311 --> 08:34.312
- Mom, what's going on?

08:34.347 --> 08:37.682
- It's unbelievable.
I just got the call.

08:37.717 --> 08:39.583
- The school's going to let
you direct plays again?

08:39.619 --> 08:41.219
- No.

08:41.254 --> 08:43.054
- You're allowed back
at the public pool?

08:43.089 --> 08:45.190
- No.

08:45.224 --> 08:47.058
- You can stop wearing
your mouth guard at night?

08:47.093 --> 08:48.460
- No!

08:48.494 --> 08:52.297
I'm a finalist in pie wars.
- Nice!

08:52.331 --> 08:55.133
- So your teeth aren't getting
any straighter?

08:55.167 --> 08:57.636
- Where'd you get that?
- Oh, it was on the table.

08:57.670 --> 08:59.271
I saw it
right before the phone rang.

08:59.305 --> 09:01.473
- I knew it.
- Here we go.

09:01.507 --> 09:03.308
- That's my lucky coin.

09:03.342 --> 09:05.577
It was given to me
by a mystical voodoo priestess.

09:05.611 --> 09:08.380
- Mrs. Atherton?
She's a librarian.

09:08.414 --> 09:10.815
- Nevertheless,
I need it for my date,

09:10.850 --> 09:12.083
So give me.

09:12.118 --> 09:14.653
- Oh, a lucky coin, you say?

09:14.687 --> 09:16.321
- Michelle,
please don't tell me

09:16.355 --> 09:18.123
You believe
in this nonsense too.

09:18.157 --> 09:20.425
- No, no, of course not.

09:20.459 --> 09:23.161
But I think I'll hold on
to it anyway,

09:23.195 --> 09:25.864
If only to teach my daughter
a lesson about grabbing.

09:25.898 --> 09:27.632
- [scoffs]
give me a break.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.501
You just want to hold it
so you can win your pie contest.

09:29.535 --> 09:31.703
- Nuh-uh.
I'm just being a good mother.

09:31.737 --> 09:36.241
- Great. In that case, you won't
mind if I get rid of the coin.

09:36.275 --> 09:37.742
- Absolutely not.

09:43.282 --> 09:44.816
- Michelle,
you're not letting go.

09:44.850 --> 09:46.851
- Yes, I am.

09:49.555 --> 09:52.223
Here you go.

09:52.258 --> 09:56.127
- What up, ghosts and ghoulies?

09:56.162 --> 09:59.331
Unnecessarily
over the top entrance!

10:00.933 --> 10:03.168
- Yo, king, we need to talk.

10:03.202 --> 10:05.303
Is that boy on a sleigh?

10:06.572 --> 10:08.173
- What do you want, preston?

10:08.207 --> 10:10.175
- I'm sick and tired
of you walking around

10:10.209 --> 10:11.176
Like you're better than us.

10:11.210 --> 10:12.744
- That's a good point...

10:12.778 --> 10:15.680
Except I am better than you--
word reversal.

10:15.715 --> 10:18.617
Count it.

10:18.651 --> 10:21.620
- [laughing]
total burn.

10:21.654 --> 10:25.790
I-I mean...
Be nice, children.

10:25.825 --> 10:28.727
- Laugh it up, king,
but the only joke I see

10:28.761 --> 10:31.296
Is you wearing
that varsity scare jacket.

10:31.330 --> 10:33.898
Double burn,
am I right, mr. D?

10:36.369 --> 10:39.537
- You got a big mouth, kid,
but can you back it up?

10:39.572 --> 10:43.174
- Oh, I can back it up,
like a dump truck.

10:43.209 --> 10:45.844
Bee! Bee! Bee!

10:45.878 --> 10:47.846
- That was...

10:47.880 --> 10:49.214
Yeah.

10:52.218 --> 10:56.121
- I'm calling you out, king.
I challenge you to a ghost duel.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.255
[all gasp]

10:57.289 --> 10:58.590
- You're on, punk.

10:58.624 --> 11:02.360
- 4:00 tomorrow,
behind the gym--best trick wins.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.728
You going down.

11:03.763 --> 11:05.597
[all gasp]

11:05.631 --> 11:07.866
- Oh, snap.

11:11.737 --> 11:14.205
- You challenged
the most powerful guy in school

11:14.240 --> 11:15.573
To a ghost duel?

11:15.608 --> 11:19.144
- Of course I did.
Nothing can stop me.

11:19.178 --> 11:20.879
- Except for the fact

11:20.913 --> 11:23.882
That all the tricks you did
yesterday were done by your dad.

11:23.916 --> 11:27.185
- [chuckles]
what?

11:27.219 --> 11:30.221
All of them?
- Not all of them...

11:30.256 --> 11:32.290
Just the ones that worked.

11:32.324 --> 11:35.660
- I don't believe you.
Lamp on.

11:38.230 --> 11:40.765
Eh, I've done worse.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.835
- Wait for it.

11:51.310 --> 11:53.511
- I believe you now.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.349
- You have to back
out of this ghost duel.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.418
- But everyone will think
I chickened out.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.253
What am I going to do?

12:02.288 --> 12:06.424
- Well, you can't go to a duel
if you're grounded.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.393
- What are you trying to say?

12:10.229 --> 12:13.465
- T-that you can't go to a duel
if you're grounded.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.735
- Way ahead of you.

12:20.306 --> 12:22.674
As soon as your mom finds out
who blew up her toilet,

12:22.708 --> 12:24.709
I'll be grounded for a week.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.544
Genius!

12:26.579 --> 12:30.548
- Or you could've just told king
you were grounded.

What happened down here?

12:34.920 --> 12:37.889
- Miles did it!

12:37.923 --> 12:40.125
I got to call king.

Yo, king, it's the "l" train.

Bummer.

Oh, I see.

He said if I can't leave
my house to duel,

13:05.351 --> 13:07.485
He'll bring the duel
to my house.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.221
He then did
an unnecessary backflip.

a little spring cleaning

13:33.546 --> 13:35.346
Before my date with kyle.

You'll dirty your pretty outfit.

being there.

13:55.334 --> 13:58.203
- Stop grabbing!

14:02.608 --> 14:04.342
What's going on?

- What? I-is there a law
against a mother and daughter

except go get embarrassed

14:25.631 --> 14:27.966
In front of the entire school.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.634

14:29.668 --> 14:32.604
I mean, who holds a duel
on a Tuesday afternoon?

14:32.638 --> 14:34.405
Most kids

That's ridiculous.
