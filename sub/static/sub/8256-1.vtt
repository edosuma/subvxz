04:01.800 --> 04:03.440
The fish are dead!

04:42.640 --> 04:45.960
The truck. Please, Mr. Huberty.
Quickly, come on.

04:52.480 --> 04:54.760
What do you know about Baal-Dahar?

04:55.120 --> 04:56.440
Baal-Da-what?

04:56.560 --> 04:59.800
l was in Jerusalem for a symposium.
Why am l here?

04:59.960 --> 05:04.600
Baal-Dahar`s an Arab village.
lt`s rumoured to be a terrorist base.

05:04.760 --> 05:08.360
l should say "was."
This morning we found it destroyed.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.320
What does that have to do with me?

05:10.440 --> 05:13.640
lt`s how it was destroyed.
That`s where we need your help.

05:13.760 --> 05:18.200
My help? l know nothing about terrorists.
l think you`ve made a terrible mistake.

05:31.840 --> 05:33.640
Please, come with me.

05:34.080 --> 05:39.000
You don`t understand. l`m the wrong man.
l can`t help you. l`m a meteorologist!

05:39.280 --> 05:42.400
We know.
That`s why we brought you here.

05:43.240 --> 05:45.120
You see that...

05:46.000 --> 05:47.640
...was Baal-Dahar.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.680
Yesterday, a kibbutz nearby was attacked.

06:08.800 --> 06:12.920
They threw a petrol bomb into the school.
Thirty-four children burned to death.

06:15.080 --> 06:18.680
We tracked the terrorists back to here
and found this.

06:20.760 --> 06:22.160
lt`s incredible.

06:23.280 --> 06:25.760
-Can you explain it?
-lt cannot be explained.

06:30.360 --> 06:32.720
-l have clearance.
-You damn well better.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.160
The Vatican.

06:43.960 --> 06:45.040
l`m sorry...

06:46.160 --> 06:47.720
...Father Lucci.

06:48.360 --> 06:49.760
Can you explain it?

06:50.400 --> 06:52.440
With the proper equipment, l think--

06:52.560 --> 06:53.880
l don`t think so.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.840
They`ll never explain it.

06:58.400 --> 07:01.840
lt`ll melt in a day or a week
and they`ll forget it.

07:01.960 --> 07:04.600
They`ll call it a freak, an aberration.

07:06.280 --> 07:07.760
You don`t think it is.

07:08.040 --> 07:11.920
l would, Colonel, except this kind of thing
happened here once before.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.600
Baal-Dahar has been here for 3,000 years.

07:14.720 --> 07:19.200
But you see, Baal-Dahar was built
on the ruins of an older place.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.800
A much older place.

07:22.120 --> 07:26.080
And it too was destroyed.
But you wouldn`t want that to explain this.

07:26.160 --> 07:27.480
Why is that?

07:29.240 --> 07:32.200
Because that place that was destroyed
was called Sodom.

07:38.920 --> 07:41.160
Destroyed by the wrath of God.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.400
How`s he doing?

08:07.720 --> 08:11.360
l have to tell you, he`s still a boy.

08:12.760 --> 08:16.880
-ls he kicking a lot?
-He`s very active. Moves all over the place.

08:17.480 --> 08:21.080
That`s great. We`re getting
some good soccer in our last trimester.

08:22.880 --> 08:25.160
l can`t wait. Two months to go.

08:25.280 --> 08:27.080
l want to see you next week.

08:27.680 --> 08:30.120
l`m not completely happy with his growth.

08:30.240 --> 08:33.200
And your amniotic fluid
is a little less than normal.

08:33.960 --> 08:35.840
But you said he`s doing fine.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.799
He is. There`s nothing
to be alarmed about.

08:38.880 --> 08:42.840
But l can`t say definitely that
we won`t run into the same problem again.

08:43.799 --> 08:47.840
l know this time it`ll be okay.
l`ve been eating really well and resting.

08:48.240 --> 08:51.440
That`s good.
So l`ll see you both next week.

08:55.040 --> 08:57.400
"...have seen the glory
Of the coming of the Lord

08:57.520 --> 09:01.480
"He has trampled out the vintage
Where the grapes of wrath are stored

09:01.640 --> 09:05.360
"He has loosed his fateful lightning
Of his terrible swift sword

09:05.520 --> 09:08.320
"His truth is marching on"

09:10.160 --> 09:12.040
They`re so adorable.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.760
Would you like to see
the computer room now?

09:18.840 --> 09:20.800
At the Oaks we start them early.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.400
So your husband is a lawyer...

09:24.120 --> 09:27.320
...and you restore fine arts
for the Hirshenson Collection.

09:28.680 --> 09:31.120
-And the baby`s due...?
-February 29th.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.000
-lt`s leap year.
-Of course.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.560
l notice you didn`t write anything under
"Religious Denomination."

09:39.120 --> 09:41.040
Do you mind if l ask why?

09:41.920 --> 09:45.200
Because l don`t have any.
ls that a problem?

09:45.400 --> 09:47.880
No, no. l just don`t like blanks.

10:03.280 --> 10:04.680
Hi, baby dog.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.680
Ace, be careful. Good boy.

10:23.240 --> 10:24.200
Hello?

10:27.640 --> 10:29.200
Well, let`s see.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.320
lt`s $650, utilities included.

10:32.640 --> 10:34.560
lt`s a garage apartment.

10:35.360 --> 10:39.000
No, no problems with the fumes.
We park our car outside.

10:40.120 --> 10:44.800
lt`s partially furnished. There`s a bed
and a table right now, but that`s about it.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.120
l see. Well, okay. Sorry.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.200
Hi, sweetness.

10:54.960 --> 10:57.520
Tragedy continues to strike
around the globe...

10:57.640 --> 11:00.680
...as the changing
weather patterns continue.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.440
-Hi, honey.
-Hi.

11:05.840 --> 11:07.320
-That`s nice.
-Thanks.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.240
How did it go today?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.560
The State Supreme Court
denied my appeal.

11:14.680 --> 11:17.720
-Are you kidding?
-l couldn`t believe it.

11:17.920 --> 11:21.160
-l thought you had such a strong appeal.
-So did l.

11:22.760 --> 11:23.880
So did l.

11:25.440 --> 11:29.800
The whole petition was based on the fact
that Jimmy`s trial lawyer was incompetent.

11:29.880 --> 11:32.840
l`ve told you that. l thought l proved it.

11:33.440 --> 11:35.440
Shit. What are you going to do?

11:37.720 --> 11:39.640
Appeal again. Fight it.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.280
Anyway, how`s our bouncing baby boy?

11:43.600 --> 11:45.240
Good. We had a good day.

11:46.280 --> 11:47.200
Good.

11:54.320 --> 11:57.760
l know we talked about it
and decided not to...

11:57.960 --> 12:00.920
...but l went to the Oaks today
and put down a deposit.

12:03.280 --> 12:05.640
lt only puts us on the waiting list
for four years.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.320
Why are you doing this?

12:08.040 --> 12:09.840
l just want to be prepared.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.760
l want you to be realistic.

12:13.440 --> 12:16.400
-l am realistic.
-We don`t know for sure if the baby--

12:16.480 --> 12:21.080
l saw Dr. lnness today.
She said l`m doing perfect. No problems.

12:22.720 --> 12:23.760
Really?

12:24.880 --> 12:26.760
This baby is going to be fine.

12:27.840 --> 12:29.080
lt has to be.

12:29.680 --> 12:32.240
lt has to be? What if it isn`t? Then what?

12:56.600 --> 12:59.040
l just don`t want to lose you, that`s all.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.360
Okay?

13:09.800 --> 13:10.760
Okay.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.480
Will you die for Him?

15:01.800 --> 15:03.360
Will you die for Him?

15:05.200 --> 15:06.440
What is it?

15:08.280 --> 15:09.680
What`s the matter?

15:09.840 --> 15:11.640
l was in these rooms.

15:11.760 --> 15:14.320
Oh, God, l could feel it coming.

15:18.920 --> 15:19.920
Death.

15:20.160 --> 15:23.120
lt was just a dream, Abby.
lt was just a dream.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.280
lt`s all right.

15:31.840 --> 15:33.560
lt was just a dream.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.200
Russell Quinn?

16:36.960 --> 16:39.080
Penny Washburn. Sorry l`m late.

16:39.240 --> 16:42.480
l understand you`re quite an expert
on death sentence appeals.

16:42.600 --> 16:43.480
So they say.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.320
What do you know about this case?

16:45.400 --> 16:48.440
So far, not much.
The kid murdered his parents?

16:48.840 --> 16:52.400
He poured gasoline on them and
set them on fire while they were sleeping.

16:52.520 --> 16:55.160
l take it this is not someone
with a lot of remorse.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.160
His parents were brother and sister.

16:57.240 --> 17:01.600
"Executed for the word of God"
is what he said in his signed confession.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.160
Jimmy....

17:13.560 --> 17:15.520
-How`s it going?
-Hello, Russell.

17:18.480 --> 17:22.520
This is Penny Washburn.
She`s going to help us with your case.

17:26.599 --> 17:28.240
-Hello, Penny.
-Hello.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.440
-Can we talk a minute?
-Yes.

17:41.600 --> 17:44.320
Penny`s going to help me
prepare a new appeal...

17:44.400 --> 17:46.200
...but we`ll need your help.

17:46.920 --> 17:49.120
l told you, l do not go to hospital.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.680
l can`t help you unless you let me.

17:52.840 --> 17:55.800
Just talk to her,
tell her what happened, that`s all.

17:56.360 --> 17:57.680
No hospital.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.680
Jimmy, this is important.

18:02.160 --> 18:05.720
lf you go to the hospital,
the doctors may find you incompetent.

18:06.160 --> 18:10.440
Then the court will reconsider your case.
Otherwise, we don`t have anything.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.640
l know what is right
and l know what is wrong.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.720
l did nothing wrong.

18:17.840 --> 18:20.120
You admitted killing your parents.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.480
lt was not wrong. lt was the law of God.

18:25.280 --> 18:26.320
Leviticus.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.120
lsn`t murder a crime too,
in the eyes of God?

18:29.520 --> 18:31.720
lt is not murder to punish the guilty.

18:31.840 --> 18:34.320
lncest may be against the law of God...

18:34.440 --> 18:37.560
...but it`s the law of California
that we`re dealing with.

18:37.640 --> 18:40.880
They`ve sentenced you to the gas chamber!
Do you want to die?

18:41.000 --> 18:41.880
No.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.040
Then go to the hospital and let the doctors
see if you knew what you were doing.

18:46.120 --> 18:48.760
That says l did a crime!
That it was wrong!

18:49.400 --> 18:53.120
lf it`ll save your life, say you`re wrong!
What is it going to matter?

18:53.240 --> 18:54.880
lt matters to God!

18:56.400 --> 18:57.720
No hospital.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.400
Goodbye, Penny.

19:08.120 --> 19:10.440
Jimmy, think about it. Please.

19:53.320 --> 19:54.640
-Hello.
-Hi.

19:56.600 --> 19:58.160
My name is David.

19:58.440 --> 19:59.840
David Bannen.

20:00.120 --> 20:02.000
l`m here about the apartment.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.680
Please, come in.

20:09.560 --> 20:12.920
Ace, get down! He usually doesn`t do this.
Go on, get down.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.280
lt`s okay. Hi, Ace.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.000
Get down!

20:20.280 --> 20:23.920
l`m surprised. He never does this.
l`ll go get the keys.

20:26.640 --> 20:28.920
Would you like a towel? You`re soaked.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.640
lt`s terrible out there, isn`t it?

20:32.280 --> 20:34.280
Yes, it is.

20:35.080 --> 20:36.960
lf l can just find these keys.

20:40.120 --> 20:41.520
Where are you from?

20:42.400 --> 20:44.960
All over. l`ve moved around a lot.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.560
-Because of work?
-Yes.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.240
What do you do?

20:50.040 --> 20:52.920
l`m a teacher. Ancient languages.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.240
Over at the university?

20:57.240 --> 20:59.720
l`ve been travelling for some time.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.720
l`ve really just come back to town.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.480
May l have some water?

21:05.600 --> 21:07.560
Sure. Let me get you a glass.

21:09.320 --> 21:11.880
-Use the bottled water, it`s better.
-Thanks.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.400
Your baby is due in February.

21:28.400 --> 21:29.520
The 29th.

21:30.440 --> 21:31.760
How did you know?

21:34.640 --> 21:36.040
l saw your calendar.

21:38.200 --> 21:41.400
lt`s kind of nice.
There isn`t a 29th except leap year.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.880
Makes it special somehow.

21:45.080 --> 21:46.480
lt is a special day.

21:50.080 --> 21:52.120
l am getting so absent-minded.

21:52.560 --> 21:55.280
l hope you`re not expecting
something fancy.

21:59.120 --> 22:00.360
This is it.

22:02.200 --> 22:03.760
lt`s a bit small.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.160
l don`t need much room.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.320
l`d like it.

22:26.800 --> 22:29.040
-lf that`s all right.
-That`s great!

22:29.680 --> 22:33.560
l`ll discuss it with my husband,
but l`m sure it won`t be a problem.

22:33.880 --> 22:36.120
Call me tomorrow and l`ll let you know.

22:36.680 --> 22:38.560
-Fine.
-We`ll talk then.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.520
l do hope this will work out.

22:44.960 --> 22:46.440
l hope so, too.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.080
l`m back.

22:53.480 --> 22:55.200
That didn`t take very long.

22:55.520 --> 22:58.960
He didn`t need much help.
About all he had was a suitcase.

22:59.680 --> 23:03.120
But he did have
first and last month`s rent in cash.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.200
Did you ask him to dinner?

23:07.320 --> 23:11.360
l did. He said, "No, thanks."
Of course, he didn`t use so many words.

23:12.840 --> 23:16.040
The guy is out there.
He`s a little bit different.

23:16.120 --> 23:18.360
l don`t know, l think he`s just quiet.

23:18.520 --> 23:22.480
He`s quiet all right.
He doesn`t have a stereo or a television.

23:22.840 --> 23:24.840
He doesn`t even want a telephone.

23:24.960 --> 23:26.440
Really? That`s weird.

23:26.560 --> 23:29.440
What`s weird is that
he has a short-wave radio.

23:29.920 --> 23:31.720
You think he`s a spy?

23:33.040 --> 23:37.240
The spearhead of an invasion force
that will take over and bore us to death!

23:37.360 --> 23:39.400
You`re such a nut. Toss that up.

23:39.760 --> 23:43.720
-Where are you going?
-l`m sure you did a great job inviting him.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.560
Looks tossed to me.

25:17.320 --> 25:20.960
-Jesus, you scared me to death.
-You snuck up on me!

25:21.120 --> 25:23.680
l was trying not to scare you.
What are you doing?

25:23.800 --> 25:26.120
Look at this. lsn`t this wild?

25:28.040 --> 25:29.520
Yeah, it is strange.

25:32.120 --> 25:35.320
David`s in the house.
He changed his mind about dinner.

25:35.440 --> 25:38.080
Maybe he`d change it again
if he saw you snooping.

25:38.160 --> 25:39.720
l`m not snooping.

25:40.400 --> 25:41.720
l`m looking.

25:43.360 --> 25:45.840
So after all that,
the senator wouldn`t even see me.

25:46.400 --> 25:50.680
This poor kid will die in the gas chamber
and l get this aide who tells me...

25:50.800 --> 25:53.360
...he doesn`t think their involvement
is appropriate.

25:53.480 --> 25:54.440
Why?

25:54.560 --> 25:56.600
Because he`s a politician.

25:56.760 --> 26:01.560
He won`t get involved in anything
that could come back and bite his fat ass.

26:01.800 --> 26:04.000
-lt`s typical.
-lt`s typical bullshit.

26:04.680 --> 26:06.320
What would you do?

26:07.640 --> 26:09.120
Me? What do you mean?

26:09.240 --> 26:10.800
Would you stop it?

26:10.960 --> 26:14.320
Of course l would, but l have no control.
l can`t do anything.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.600
Maybe you can.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.160
She can`t do anything, David.

26:21.280 --> 26:25.240
That`s what l`m saying, nobody listens
anymore. l`m the kid`s attorney...

26:25.320 --> 26:28.440
...and they won`t listen to me.
So they won`t listen to Abby.

26:28.520 --> 26:30.080
Maybe you are right.

26:31.160 --> 26:32.800
lt`s not up to us.

26:33.320 --> 26:34.800
-How about dessert?
-Please.

26:41.680 --> 26:43.840
Jesus Christ! Look at this!

26:46.240 --> 26:47.560
Get a broom.

26:48.640 --> 26:49.800
Please don`t!

26:52.040 --> 26:53.760
l wasn`t going to hurt it.

26:56.360 --> 26:57.560
l`m sorry.

27:02.480 --> 27:03.640
That was weird.

27:05.200 --> 27:06.320
Do you know...

27:07.480 --> 27:11.040
...there`s a story about a new-born child
and the sparrow`s song.

27:13.600 --> 27:15.000
lt`s ancient.

27:16.800 --> 27:17.840
Hebrew.

27:20.120 --> 27:22.440
They believed that in Heaven...

27:23.000 --> 27:25.360
...God`s mansion has many halls.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.240
And that one of these halls
is the Hall of Souls.

27:30.160 --> 27:31.640
lt`s called The Guf.

27:31.760 --> 27:32.840
"The Guf"?

27:33.680 --> 27:35.920
They say whenever a baby is born...

27:37.000 --> 27:39.240
...this is where its soul comes from.

27:40.040 --> 27:42.600
As the soul descends from heaven...

27:43.680 --> 27:45.840
...only the sparrows can see it.

27:46.640 --> 27:48.040
So they sing.

27:49.640 --> 27:53.440
So whenever you hear a sparrow sing,
you know a baby`s about to be born?

27:56.840 --> 27:58.920
The Guf. l like it.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.560
l`ll get the dessert.

28:07.600 --> 28:10.000
-Would you like some coffee?
-Yes, please.

28:17.640 --> 28:19.680
Wasn`t that the sweetest story?

28:20.680 --> 28:22.880
lt sounded like a bunch of guff to me.

28:53.240 --> 28:55.800
"The second angel
poured his bowl into the sea.

28:58.280 --> 29:00.760
"And it became as the blood
of a dead man...

29:01.840 --> 29:04.040
"...and every living thing...

29:06.280 --> 29:08.520
"...died that was in the sea."

29:14.920 --> 29:16.480
The prophecies...

29:18.600 --> 29:20.320
...they have begun.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.160
The Guf.

29:37.520 --> 29:38.920
Do you like that?

29:39.480 --> 29:42.280
l do. lt reminds me of a story l heard.

29:42.360 --> 29:44.920
lt`s ltalian. Really good quality.

29:45.240 --> 29:47.560
l don`t know. l`ve spent
so much money already.

29:47.800 --> 29:50.000
But it`s so cute. Yeah, why not?

29:50.120 --> 29:53.240
You only live once, right?
Will this be on your card?

30:14.320 --> 30:16.320
Mrs. Quinn, are you okay?

30:16.640 --> 30:18.120
Yeah, l`m fine.

31:05.520 --> 31:06.480
Shit.

32:46.080 --> 32:48.880
Excuse me, lady.
What are you doing here?

32:49.560 --> 32:51.280
l`m looking for someone.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.480
There`s no one here but the minyan.

32:53.600 --> 32:55.960
l followed him in, he`s wearing a grey coat.

32:56.080 --> 32:57.480
No one came in.

32:57.920 --> 32:59.480
But l followed him in.

32:59.800 --> 33:02.680
l`ve been here ten minutes.
No one has come in.

33:06.440 --> 33:07.440
You okay?

33:08.600 --> 33:10.160
Are you okay, lady?

33:10.720 --> 33:11.840
Yes, l`m fine.

33:13.200 --> 33:16.400
You better leave now.
We don`t want to disturb kaddish.

33:17.720 --> 33:19.960
Kaddish. The prayer for the dead.

34:34.120 --> 34:35.760
You`re going to be fine.

34:43.239 --> 34:45.960
This won`t hurt.
You`ll just feel some pressure.

34:47.320 --> 34:49.040
Don`t hurt my baby.

34:50.040 --> 34:52.320
-Keep breathing.
-Take a deep breath.

34:53.040 --> 34:56.360
Just take a deep breath. There you go.
We`re almost through.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.840
You`re doing just fine.

34:59.360 --> 35:02.440
Just hold still. Breathe.
Take a deep breath.

35:03.440 --> 35:06.240
Breathe. Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

35:06.440 --> 35:08.360
You`re doing a good job.

35:09.600 --> 35:11.680
lt`s going to come out now.

35:15.080 --> 35:16.800
Good job, good job.

35:20.120 --> 35:22.520
Why does this keep happening to her?

35:27.200 --> 35:28.920
lt`s too early for Caesarean.

35:29.040 --> 35:32.000
Right. The baby`s lungs
aren`t fully matured yet.

35:32.720 --> 35:34.880
But the immediate threat is over.

35:35.000 --> 35:39.520
Right now we have to keep her from
going into labour for at least two weeks.

35:39.640 --> 35:42.280
l`ve started her on ritodrine again.

35:44.040 --> 35:45.040
Can she go home?

35:45.160 --> 35:49.880
No. l want to keep her here for 48 hours.
She needs to rest as much as possible...

35:50.040 --> 35:52.120
...both mentally and physically.

35:53.960 --> 35:55.440
-Can l see her?
-Sure.

35:59.360 --> 36:00.760
There she is.

36:07.840 --> 36:09.240
How are you feeling?

36:11.400 --> 36:13.320
lt`s not like the last time.

36:14.120 --> 36:15.920
Don`t even think about that.

36:16.400 --> 36:17.600
Just rest.

36:17.840 --> 36:20.560
l know that feeling. lt`s different this time.

36:21.800 --> 36:25.000
Something else is causing it.
The pain isn`t even the same.

36:25.120 --> 36:27.120
lt`s not coming from the inside.

36:28.360 --> 36:32.080
Margaret said you can come home
in a couple of days.

36:32.280 --> 36:35.240
Then a couple days in bed,
you`ll be as good as new.

36:36.240 --> 36:39.680
Why won`t she believe me?
Can`t she find out what`s really going on?

36:39.800 --> 36:41.520
She`s trying, Abby.

36:47.320 --> 36:49.520
l know something`s happening.

36:50.200 --> 36:52.200
lt`s different this time.

36:52.920 --> 36:54.320
l know it is.

38:04.320 --> 38:07.960
"The third angel poured his bowl
into the rivers, and they became...

38:10.320 --> 38:11.560
"...blood."

38:14.360 --> 38:17.640
Reports of more fighting near
the Nicaraguan border today.

38:17.960 --> 38:22.240
ln the fiercest confrontation of the year,
casualties are mounting on both sides.

38:23.400 --> 38:26.440
Refugee camps have sprung up
in areas considered safe...

38:26.560 --> 38:29.600
...but even these have received sniper fire.

38:31.040 --> 38:32.840
l love the news.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.400
-How are you feeling?
-Good.

38:36.640 --> 38:38.800
-Want some dinner?
-Want me to cook?

38:38.920 --> 38:42.360
l`ll take care of it.
How about some pasta primavera?

38:43.880 --> 38:48.480
-Do you know how long that`ll take?
-Twenty minutes. l`ll go pick it up.

38:50.640 --> 38:54.600
...rescuers can only watch
the great beings gasp for breath...

38:54.720 --> 38:57.760
...away from what had always been,
for them and us...

38:57.840 --> 38:59.400
...the protective sea.

38:59.480 --> 39:02.440
Locally, a different kind of tragedy today.

39:02.600 --> 39:06.480
A drive-by shooting between rival gangs
claimed the lives...

39:06.600 --> 39:10.200
...of a woman and her 4-year-old child.
Caught in the crossfire--

39:10.320 --> 39:14.680
The death toll in this latest
terrorist bombing is expected to climb--

39:15.040 --> 39:18.000
Bloodshed in the war
between lraq and lran--

39:19.480 --> 39:22.360
...raped repeatedly, her body was dumped--

39:22.440 --> 39:25.960
...was apparently set by representatives
of a radical--

39:26.320 --> 39:28.200
ln international news...

39:28.280 --> 39:31.320
...French officials announced
they have two suspects...

39:31.440 --> 39:34.720
...in the bombing
of the Champs Elysees restaurant....

39:34.840 --> 39:35.760
Abby.

39:37.520 --> 39:38.720
l`m sorry.

39:41.880 --> 39:45.160
lt`s okay. l thought you were away.

39:45.440 --> 39:47.000
l just came back.

39:48.920 --> 39:49.960
No, please.

39:52.560 --> 39:54.280
l just wanted to....

39:56.120 --> 39:57.680
How do you feel?

39:58.040 --> 39:59.440
l`m all right.

40:00.960 --> 40:04.160
l thought l saw you the other day,
in the rain.

40:04.840 --> 40:08.160
l wasn`t sure if it was you,
but l thought you might need a ride.

40:08.280 --> 40:09.920
You are very kind.

40:12.360 --> 40:13.680
That`s rare.

40:16.280 --> 40:17.440
Were you there?

40:19.000 --> 40:20.480
So much misery.

40:22.840 --> 40:24.400
Man against man.

40:25.480 --> 40:28.680
They kill each other. They have no faith.

40:30.400 --> 40:32.760
l used to think the world would change...

40:34.640 --> 40:36.200
...but it hasn`t.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.400
No, l guess it hasn`t.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.040
lt`s sad.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.680
The course is chosen...

40:59.440 --> 41:01.480
...and it can`t be turned.

41:03.320 --> 41:05.040
What do you mean, "course"?

41:08.240 --> 41:09.640
Toward death.

41:12.240 --> 41:14.800
l really don`t think we`ll blow ourselves up.

41:14.880 --> 41:16.600
l didn`t mean that.

41:21.840 --> 41:23.480
l better go upstairs now.

41:24.360 --> 41:25.560
Excuse me.

41:31.240 --> 41:32.880
l`m sorry about the baby.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.800
After all your travels, Father Lucci...

41:41.360 --> 41:45.040
-...you`ve reached these conclusions?
-l have, Your Eminence.

41:45.640 --> 41:49.520
You have no doubt, no doubt whatsoever,
regarding the signs?

41:50.240 --> 41:52.960
No doubt at all. They were not signs.

41:54.160 --> 41:58.640
Not to try your patience, Father,
but once again:

42:00.240 --> 42:02.120
The snow in the Negev.

42:02.720 --> 42:05.360
Didn`t the lsraeli Army report that?

42:05.520 --> 42:06.840
l was there.

42:07.480 --> 42:10.960
l saw a freak,
an aberration of convective showers.

42:11.600 --> 42:14.480
Frigid air from the Balkans
was swept into a cut off low.

42:14.600 --> 42:19.160
lt created a storm of such intensity,
it sucked the freezing rain from the sky.

42:19.280 --> 42:22.400
lt turned everything in its path to ice.
A rare occurrence.

42:22.520 --> 42:25.760
lt happens once in 100 years.
But a sign from God?

42:27.040 --> 42:28.520
Everything you saw...

42:28.960 --> 42:32.760
...was either scientifically explainable
or a hoax?

42:33.240 --> 42:34.960
Yes, Your Eminence.

42:38.640 --> 42:42.680
My brothers, all these things l saw
were of the natural world.

42:43.600 --> 42:45.760
There have been no miracles.

42:47.560 --> 42:50.360
These were not signs of the Apocalypse.

42:56.080 --> 42:58.080
l will tell His Holiness.

42:59.080 --> 43:01.120
He will be quite relieved.

43:02.200 --> 43:04.680
He has tickets next week to Faust.

45:39.280 --> 45:41.600
"2-29." That`s the baby`s birthdate.

46:29.600 --> 46:31.600
l can`t understand any of this.

46:32.240 --> 46:34.480
What about the baby`s birthdate on it?

46:34.880 --> 46:39.320
We don`t have a corner on February 29th.
You don`t know that`s what that means.

46:40.040 --> 46:43.080
Have you ever seen
strange writing like this?

46:44.320 --> 46:48.680
And what about those horrible clippings?
Russell, he`s here because of the baby!

46:49.200 --> 46:52.520
You think David is responsible
for what`s wrong with the baby?

46:53.160 --> 46:56.120
What`s wrong with the baby is called
placental insufficiency!

46:56.280 --> 46:58.520
You`re wrong! l told you, it`s different!

46:58.640 --> 47:03.160
lt isn`t! Nobody is trying to hurt the baby.
lt`s just like last time.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.120
Abby, what do you want me to do?
Kick him out?

47:08.320 --> 47:10.680
Would that make you feel better?

47:17.560 --> 47:21.600
All right. He`s gone.
l`ll tell him as soon as l see him.

48:12.680 --> 48:14.640
l`m looking for Dr. Ornstein.

48:15.160 --> 48:16.640
Rabbi Ornstein.

48:17.040 --> 48:18.160
You stay.

48:27.080 --> 48:28.960
Are you Dr. Ornstein, the linguist?

48:29.080 --> 48:31.200
Among other things. May l help you?

48:31.520 --> 48:33.400
l hope so. l`m Abby Quinn.

48:42.520 --> 48:44.080
Nice move, lady.

48:45.400 --> 48:47.400
-What`d l do?
-You touched him.

48:47.720 --> 48:51.240
You don`t touch a Hasidic rabbi
unless you`re his wife.

48:51.400 --> 48:54.040
-Are you serious?
-No. l`m making it up.

48:54.320 --> 48:56.200
lt`s halakah. lt`s the law.

48:57.080 --> 48:59.880
-l should apologise.
-l wouldn`t do that.

49:00.720 --> 49:03.040
Just leave. He won`t see you again.

49:03.720 --> 49:07.360
l have to see him.
l need to know what language this is.

49:09.200 --> 49:10.520
That`s Melachim.

49:11.560 --> 49:15.160
lt`s Melachim.
lt`s a secret form of Hebrew, like a code.

49:15.960 --> 49:19.000
ln the Middle Ages,
scholars used it to protect their writings.

49:19.120 --> 49:20.200
You know it?

49:20.360 --> 49:23.160
l hope so. l learned it from him
when l was nine.

49:23.760 --> 49:25.400
Then you can translate it?

49:25.560 --> 49:29.600
l guess so. lt`s just
a simple replacement alphabet.

49:33.680 --> 49:36.040
Come on. There`s a book l`ll need.

49:42.800 --> 49:44.040
Here it is.

49:47.560 --> 49:50.760
So, what is this?
How does this date translate?

49:52.320 --> 49:53.960
That`s not a date.

49:54.720 --> 49:57.520
Of course it is. 2-29. February 29th.

49:58.440 --> 50:00.920
-Have you ever read the Bible?
-Well, yeah.

50:02.600 --> 50:06.640
Well, 2:29, it`s a Bible heading.
Chapter and verse.

50:06.920 --> 50:09.200
Chapter 2, verse 29.

50:09.720 --> 50:11.120
Are you sure?

50:11.400 --> 50:15.840
The whole page is a quote from the Bible.
Book of Joel 2:29.

50:17.800 --> 50:19.680
Can you read it for me?

50:22.040 --> 50:25.560
"Even upon the menservants
and maidservants in those days...

50:25.840 --> 50:27.720
"...l will pour out my spirit.

50:28.200 --> 50:31.480
"And l will give portents in the heavens
and on the earth...

50:31.600 --> 50:33.960
"...blood and fire and columns of smoke.

50:34.440 --> 50:37.640
"The sun shall be turned to darkness,
and the moon to blood...

50:37.760 --> 50:40.480
"...before the great and terrible day
of the Lord comes."

50:40.680 --> 50:42.320
What is "the great and terrible day"?

50:42.400 --> 50:45.120
When God passes judgement
on mankind for its sins.

50:46.160 --> 50:47.960
lt`s about the Apocalypse.

50:48.280 --> 50:50.240
Come on! The end of the world?

50:50.360 --> 50:54.160
That`s what the portents are.
The sun going dark, the moon turning red.

50:54.320 --> 50:56.200
They foretell the end of the world.

50:56.280 --> 50:59.160
There`s a whole chain of signs,
like a countdown.

50:59.680 --> 51:02.640
Earthquakes, plagues,
water turning to blood.

51:02.920 --> 51:05.040
All kinds of weird natural disasters.

51:05.160 --> 51:08.720
They`re to warn us that God`s wrath
is about to destroy the world.

51:10.680 --> 51:12.560
That`s what this paper`s about?

51:12.680 --> 51:14.760
Yeah, the signs of the end.

51:15.080 --> 51:16.960
Didn`t you go to Sunday school?

51:17.440 --> 51:21.320
A long time ago. But they taught us
that God was a God of love.

51:22.360 --> 51:23.520
Are you okay?

51:24.480 --> 51:28.200
But what do Biblical prophecies
have to do with the baby?

51:28.840 --> 51:32.800
Avi, would you translate it anyway,
just to be sure?

51:33.320 --> 51:34.880
Here`s my number.

51:35.200 --> 51:38.640
-l guess l could have it for you tomorrow.
-That would be great.

51:41.280 --> 51:42.840
-Bye.
-Okay, Mrs. Quinn.

52:07.680 --> 52:09.400
The Guf, 358.

52:21.320 --> 52:24.520
"ln Judeo-Christian mythology,
The Guf is the Hall of Souls.

52:24.640 --> 52:28.280
"Every time an infant is born,
this is where its soul comes from.

52:29.120 --> 52:33.400
"Folklore says sparrows can see the soul`s
descent and this explains their song.

52:34.080 --> 52:37.200
"But a day will come
when the sparrow sings no more...

52:38.200 --> 52:41.600
"...because there are only
a finite number of souls in The Guf.

52:44.200 --> 52:48.720
"lt`s when the last soul is used, and
The Guf is empty, that the world will end.

52:50.960 --> 52:53.760
"The first infant born without a soul...

52:56.560 --> 52:59.520
"...born dead as a soulless child
must be, heralds...

52:59.960 --> 53:02.760
"...the death of the world,
and so is called...

53:03.280 --> 53:05.000
"...The Final Sign."

53:13.160 --> 53:16.280
l`m trying to reach the governor.
lt`s urgent.

53:17.480 --> 53:20.720
l told you it has to do
with Jimmy Zaragoza`s execution.

53:21.040 --> 53:22.760
Russell, it`s Abby.

53:23.480 --> 53:26.920
l`ve already spoken to his aide.
l need to speak to him directly.

53:28.360 --> 53:31.000
Yes, l`ll hold. Tell her l`ll call her back.

53:31.120 --> 53:35.000
l tried, but she`s not at home.
She says she must speak to you right now.

53:35.520 --> 53:38.160
Cover for me. Abby, are you all--

53:38.400 --> 53:41.840
lt`s not the baby`s birth date,
it`s from the Bible.

53:42.160 --> 53:44.360
He`s here because of the baby.

53:44.560 --> 53:46.040
Slow down.

53:46.560 --> 53:48.720
He thinks it`s a Bible sign!

53:48.840 --> 53:52.400
He told us about it,
but not the whole story. Listen:

53:52.800 --> 53:57.440
"The first infant born without a soul,
born dead as a soulless child must be--"

54:01.360 --> 54:04.080
No, it`s not! He`s a religious fanatic!

54:04.240 --> 54:07.200
He thinks if he can kill the baby,
he`ll end the world.

54:07.320 --> 54:09.560
-Listen to me.
-l`ve got the governor.

54:09.840 --> 54:12.320
Ask him to hold. l want you to go home.

54:17.920 --> 54:19.400
All right? l promise.

54:22.240 --> 54:23.800
Sorry, he wouldn`t wait.

54:24.200 --> 54:25.440
Oh, Christ!

54:32.880 --> 54:35.520
Keep working on this
and l`ll try him from home.

55:27.320 --> 55:30.520
Russell, are you here?

55:33.040 --> 55:36.720
-You won`t kill my baby.
-Your baby`s dying because it has no soul.

55:36.960 --> 55:39.440
-Don`t say that.
-The Guf is empty!

55:39.760 --> 55:41.960
l won`t let you kill my baby.

55:42.520 --> 55:44.760
Don`t you think l cry for man?

55:45.040 --> 55:48.440
l`ve tried to intercede, but God has judged!

55:49.720 --> 55:51.520
-Man`s sins are--
-Stay away!

55:55.200 --> 55:58.480
l can`t die again, Abby. l wish l could.

55:59.960 --> 56:03.400
-l`m His messenger.
-You`re crazy.

56:04.280 --> 56:06.560
-l was here before.
-Stay away.

56:07.840 --> 56:10.200
lt`s time for you to know, Abby.

56:12.200 --> 56:14.000
l came as the Lamb...

56:16.320 --> 56:19.040
...and l return as the Lion.

56:38.920 --> 56:40.640
Now l am His wrath.

56:50.480 --> 56:51.960
Strap her down!

56:53.000 --> 56:56.120
lt`s happening!
Why won`t you believe me?

56:57.600 --> 56:59.480
You have to believe me.

57:13.400 --> 57:14.440
Please.

57:20.960 --> 57:22.760
Will you die for Him?

57:31.400 --> 57:34.760
l don`t know what you could have done.
This can happen.

57:36.000 --> 57:39.880
l know the delusions seem extreme,
but she`s under enormous stress.

57:40.120 --> 57:43.080
There`s incredible guilt involved when....

57:44.640 --> 57:47.280
Well, you certainly know the history.

57:50.560 --> 57:52.200
What do we do now?

57:53.200 --> 57:57.840
This sounds pathetic, but the best
we can do is wait and see. Watch her.

58:01.040 --> 58:03.680
The baby`s fine. He`s hanging in there.

58:03.800 --> 58:07.360
lf this is just an episode,
she can go home in a couple of days.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.040
Will you be able to stay with her?

58:10.920 --> 58:14.560
-Not all the time.
-Then we should get you a nurse to help.

58:16.720 --> 58:20.200
And l think you should go home now
and get some serious rest.

58:25.280 --> 58:27.160
Of course, God will judge the world.

58:27.280 --> 58:30.480
-Could it be happening now?
-lt could happen any time.

58:31.120 --> 58:34.160
Jesus said the end would come
like a thief in the night.

58:34.280 --> 58:36.840
That belief is fundamental
to every religion.

58:36.920 --> 58:39.960
Moslem, Christian, Jew, Hindu.

58:40.960 --> 58:44.720
There are differences amongst them
as to how it will actually happen...

58:44.840 --> 58:48.360
...but we all believe in a Messiah
who delivers God`s wrath...

58:48.640 --> 58:49.960
...upon the world.

58:50.120 --> 58:54.160
Then it could be happening.
The moon has turned to blood.

58:54.360 --> 58:57.160
l told you about the paper and the fish.

58:57.720 --> 59:01.360
Yes. ln Revelation,
it is written that the sea will die.

59:02.000 --> 59:05.520
-Then you do see it?
-With perfect clarity.

59:06.720 --> 59:09.920
l see a young man
with a very large imagination.

59:10.600 --> 59:13.640
What you`re forgetting is that
the prophetic signs are signs.

59:13.720 --> 59:16.600
They`re symbols.
They`re not meant to be taken literally.

59:16.720 --> 59:21.520
They`re poetry written to describe
the concept of greater divine judgement...

59:21.920 --> 59:24.480
...not to be checked off like a laundry list.

59:25.800 --> 59:27.440
So the moon and the fish?

59:27.640 --> 59:31.680
Coincidence. You`re forgetting
the most important aspect of eschatology.

59:32.640 --> 59:35.880
That when the end comes,
with it comes eternal life...

59:36.840 --> 59:38.840
...for those of us who are saved.

59:39.560 --> 59:41.920
Well, who`ll be saved, Reverend?

59:42.400 --> 59:45.200
The Jew doesn`t think
it will be the Moslem.

59:45.400 --> 59:47.720
The Moslem doesn`t think
it will be the Christian.

59:47.840 --> 59:50.720
The Christian doesn`t think
it will be the Buddhist.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.800
What if nobody is saved?
What if we`re all wrong?

59:56.400 --> 59:59.280
My God. What if it`s just
the Hare Krishnas?

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:05.280
-You`re too young to worry so much.
-That`s what my rabbi said.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:09.160
Believe me, Avi,
someday you`ll make quite a philosopher.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.720
lf there is a someday.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.160
Hello, Mr. Quinn. She`s fine.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.280
Could you give me that number again?

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:26.360
When? Well, l have to leave.
No, it`s impossible--

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.240
No, she`s upstairs resting.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:33.920
l`ll tell her.

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.520
l want my baby.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.480
We still house noviciates here, of course.
But we do get quite a few guests, also.

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:59.400
Mostly people passing through
on their way to new parishes.

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:03.160
-ls that what you`re doing, Father Lucci?
-Yes, it is.

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:06.640
-Then you won`t be staying very long?
-Father Morrell?

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:17.120
May l help you?

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.880
No, Father, this is Father Lucci.

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.320
l`m sorry. l thought that....

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.400
But the resemblance is...

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.400
...remarkable.

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:30.360
l don`t believe we`ve met.

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:33.560
No, it couldn`t be. That was long ago.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.400
Very long ago.

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.320
lf you`ll excuse me.

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:41.640
But the resemblance...

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.000
...it`s remarkable!

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:49.320
Really?

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.720
Good night, Father.

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.160
Abby?

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.680
Why is this happening?

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.960
God`s grace is empty.

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.080
There`s nothing l can do.

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:30.200
The signs have begun.
As each passes, the end grows closer.

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.280
Then why are you here?

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:37.160
l`m its deliverer. l`m its witness.

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:44.160
What if a sign didn`t happen?

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:49.320
What if a sign could be stopped before
my baby comes? What would happen?

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.320
Please, tell me.

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:55.040
Then the chain would be broken.

01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:00.280
But it would take something
you don`t have.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:01.520
Hope.

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:15.960
How can someone who cared
so little for life...

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:18.840
...give life to the world?

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:20.120
l do care.

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:30.800
l`m going to try.

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:35.440
l`m going to try.

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:38.760
Any chance at all, sir?

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:43.080
What can you do now that
the federal appeal has been denied?

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:49.360
With less than 24 hours to go,
can you do anything to stop the execution?

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.880
"The windows of heaven," Mrs. Quinn...

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:51.000
"...the windows of heaven are open
and the earth is rent asunder.

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:53.600
"lt falls...

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:56.520
"...and will not rise again!"

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:02.120
Please, Mrs. Quinn, it doesn`t have to be.

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.000
How do you know my name?

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:08.120
l followed the signs. They led me to you.

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:11.120
Who are you?

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:15.000
A priest who`s come to help you
and your baby. We don`t have much time.

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:16.160
Please.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.400
l know what you`re going through.
l know what`s going to happen.

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.480
Hey, Mrs. Quinn!

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:54.280
l must know everything he`s told you
if l`m to help.

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:57.200
He said if l can stop a sign,
the chain will be broken.

01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.360
He said that?

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:01.360
Yes, and God would grant the world
a second chance.

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:04.120
Did he tell you which sign to stop?

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.120
No, l`m trying to figure it out.

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:09.480
No, no. That`s impossible.
A sign can`t be stopped.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.880
He wouldn`t have told me
if there weren`t a way.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.680
That`s why l have to know the other signs.
You said you knew them.

01:08:18.279 --> 01:08:21.640
God has no secrets.
The signs are contained in the seven seals.

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:25.279
The first four have already begun.
The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:27.479
And their signs are almost over.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:31.160
-The fifth is the death of the last martyr.
-A death could be stopped.

01:08:31.279 --> 01:08:33.080
But whose? Where?

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:38.600
-What about the sixth?
-The sun will turn to darkness...

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:42.840
...and the earth will quake
and the stars shall fall from the sky.

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:46.000
"And when the Lamb opened
the seventh seal...

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:48.600
"...there was silence in heaven."

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.439
The silence of The Guf, empty.

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:55.720
The stillbirth of the soulless child.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
You are the seventh seal.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.399
l`m not going to let my baby die.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.600
One of the signs has to be stopped.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.560
How? Do you know how?

01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:18.640
With hope.

01:09:21.399 --> 01:09:23.560
Can hope stop an earthquake?

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:27.319
Can it stop a murder
halfway around the globe?

01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:30.760
The fourth horseman still rides.

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:35.279
The angels have unleashed the winds
from the corners of the earth.

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.960
Can you stop that with hope?

01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:53.279
Will you die for Him?

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:04.880
Will you die for Him?

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:07.880
No!

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:15.840
You hit him in my dream.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.560
lt was no dream.

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:19.720
You were there.

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:23.920
You`re not here to help.
You want the world to end.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:26.920
Yes, Mrs. Quinn. For a very long time.

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.920
You are my deliverance.

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:37.920
There`s nothing you can do.
You can`t stop it.

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:23.800
What kind of God are you?

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:29.760
Let me in!

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.640
You were always nosy, Harold.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.600
lt is you, Morrell.

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:45.840
But that was 70 years ago.

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:51.040
That was just yesterday to me.

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:53.280
But you haven`t aged.

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.160
You haven`t changed.

01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.400
ln the name of God, how?

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:00.920
ln the name of God is how.

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:05.760
l was cursed by Him for what l had done.
l struck a man.

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:08.720
But, of course, He was no man.

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:11.760
He was the Son of God.

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:15.120
l am Cartaphilus.

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.160
Pilate`s gatekeeper?

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:21.000
The Roman soldier who was--

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:23.720
Cursed to walk the earth
until the Messiah returned.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:28.040
Cursed to live and never die,
until it was time for the world to die.

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:31.400
And so it has been for 2,000 years.

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:35.040
For me, there`s been no escape
from the misery of life.

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:38.520
But l always knew my sentence
would not be eternal.

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.800
And so, l win!

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:44.320
An end has come! My death is at hand.

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:49.080
l won`t be stopped by anyone.
Not her, not you.

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.320
l can`t allow it.

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:56.240
You understand, don`t you, old friend?

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:08.560
Thank you.

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.120
Did you see him?

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.760
l`m gonna die?

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:30.440
l tried, Jimmy. l did everything l could.

01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.320
They don`t understand.

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:39.920
Do you think God will forgive them?

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:48.320
l don`t know.

01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:58.760
So we`ve got to stop this death.
Whose death?

01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:01.840
l don`t know.
lt`s somebody who`s a martyr.

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:05.280
-That`s the fourth sign?
-No, l think it`s the fifth.

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:09.000
The last martyr, an earthquake and....

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:13.080
l don`t know. l can`t think anymore.
You should know this!

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:16.160
That`s not my book,
it`s the New Testament.

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:18.640
Pull over. Pull over there!

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:31.920
-What are you doing?
-Getting us a Bible!

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.000
We need a room!

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:52.560
Thirty bucks.

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:03.560
-Got it. Revelation 5. "A Scroll--"
-Read me the sixth sign.

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:10.240
"When he broke the sixth seal,
there was a great earthquake...

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:14.400
"...and the sun became black as sackcloth
and the moon became red as blood."

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:18.920
An eclipse.
lt`s on my calendar for tomorrow.

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:21.280
Go back to the fifth sign.

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:27.400
"When He opened the fifth seal, l saw the
souls of those slain for the word of God.

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:32.200
"They cried, `Lord, when wilt thou avenge
our blood on those on the earth?`

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:36.160
"They were told to rest until the number
of their brethren was complete...

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:38.920
"...who were to be killed
as they themselves had been."

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:40.840
The death of the last martyr.

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:44.360
lt`s someone who dies for the word of God,
before the eclipse.

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.120
How?

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:49.880
Tortured to death? Murdered?

01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:57.720
Executed.

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:07.560
Attorneys were unable to get
a stay of execution for Jimmy Zaragoza...

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:11.360
...the "Word of God Killer,"
whose parents were brother and sister.

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:14.760
He murdered them, he said,
"because it was God`s law. "

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:18.320
This morning, Jimmy will die
according to man`s law.

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:03.160
Hello?

01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:07.040
Abby, where are you?

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:09.280
Russell, l know how to stop it.

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:12.840
An eclipse?

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.880
Abby, l can`t stop the execution.

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:20.240
You must. He is the last martyr.
You can`t let them kill him.

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:23.640
There`s nothing l can do.
Tell me where you are.

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:26.360
Abby, are you all right?

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:29.400
l`ll meet you at the prison.

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:31.200
No! You can`t stop--

01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:32.960
l`m going to leave now.

01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:59.400
Penny! Thank God! You`ve got to
get me in! You`ve got to help me.

01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:42.080
Okay, breathe, breathe.

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:38.880
Stop!

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:50.560
Somebody stop him!

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:35.840
l did it. lt`s over.

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:39.280
Somebody....

01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:43.680
Somebody help us!

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:47.000
No!

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:52.480
Somebody help us!

01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:54.600
lt`s all right, Abby.

01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:56.960
God, no!

01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:08.240
Sorry. lt`s all my fault.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.560
lt`s all right, Abby.

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:18.800
Breathe deeply.

01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:23.400
Relax. Breathe.

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:42.200
All right, push.

01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:47.600
-Breathe, Abby.
-Push!

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:52.760
You`re fine.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.200
lt`s all right. You`re doing good.
Deep breaths!

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:11.360
Can you do it one more time?

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:13.160
One more time, Abby.

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.680
That a girl. Come on, push!

01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:27.760
Hold on! The head is out!

01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:31.320
Come on, sweetheart, we`re almost there!

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:40.920
We`ve lost the baby`s heartbeat.

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:50.880
Will you die for Him?

01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:54.320
Will you die for Him?

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.560
Yes, l will!

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:01.600
l will die for Him.

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:07.360
l will die for Him.

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:22.040
He`s beautiful, Abby...

01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:27.160
...just like you said he`d be.

01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:31.160
You can`t see him...

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.120
...but you know.

01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:38.000
You always knew.

01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:58.000
The Hall of Souls is full again.

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:04.000
lt was you, Abby.

01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:10.000
Just the one person with hope enough
for the whole world.

01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:36.280
Remember it all.

01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:38.720
Write it down.

01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:41.320
Tell it...

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:46.280
...so people will use the chance
she has given them.
