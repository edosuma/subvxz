00:07.924 --> 00:09.384
-Hey, Mom.
<i>-Hey.</i>

00:09.467 --> 00:12.262
Wanna hear some jokes
about Freylich Syndrome kids?

00:12.387 --> 00:13.263
<i>Okay.</i>

00:13.346 --> 00:15.056
They never get old.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.391
<i>It's not funny, Isobel.</i>

00:16.558 --> 00:19.352
No, it is. It's hilarious.

00:19.477 --> 00:20.854
<i>-No, it's not.</i>

00:21.229 --> 00:23.064
You just have to take a step back.

00:23.773 --> 00:25.066
<i>Have you had any nosebleeds, honey?</i>

00:25.150 --> 00:25.984
Nope.

00:26.609 --> 00:28.695
No nosebleeds. All good.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.740
<i>Okay, I'm so glad to hear that.</i>
<i>I've been so worried about you.</i>

00:31.823 --> 00:34.034
Mom. I gotta call you back.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.911
The Spanish Inquisition just walked in.

00:36.995 --> 00:38.288
<i>Okay, I love you.</i>

00:38.371 --> 00:39.497
-Love you, too.
<i>-Bye.</i>

00:39.622 --> 00:40.457
Bye.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.878
Yes?

00:44.961 --> 00:47.422
We've made arrangements
to get you back to Boise.

00:47.547 --> 00:48.923
No. Uh-uh.

00:49.090 --> 00:50.675
Why risk one of your coyote's lives

00:50.842 --> 00:52.510
just so I can die in my own bed?

00:52.635 --> 00:54.721
Why don't you let us bring your mom here?

00:54.846 --> 00:56.765
It's the same problem, though, isn't it?

00:56.931 --> 01:00.477
Why bring my mom here
just so she can watch me die?

01:01.478 --> 01:02.854
You are a stubborn one.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.189
So they tell me.

01:04.856 --> 01:05.857
-Any nose--
-No.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.609
No nosebleeds.

01:08.610 --> 01:11.154
-Only, like, 20.

01:11.279 --> 01:12.113
Yeah.

01:14.282 --> 01:16.242
Oh, we should've warned you.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.119
This is our drawer of heads.

01:18.828 --> 01:22.040
We're calling the prison bus murders
"Satan's Jigsaw Puzzle."

01:22.123 --> 01:24.876
We started with the face pieces
and are working our way out.

01:28.463 --> 01:30.048
Don't you zombies just like the brains?

01:30.131 --> 01:31.341
How do you account for the dismemberment?

01:31.424 --> 01:34.344
We figure the mob was starving,
and everyone wanted a piece.

01:35.136 --> 01:36.179
What a way to go.

01:36.387 --> 01:37.931
Don't waste your sympathy on these guys.

01:38.181 --> 01:39.474
They're the worst of the worst.

01:39.766 --> 01:42.185
Who's that guy
who put his victims' organs in jars?

01:42.560 --> 01:43.645
Perry the Pickler.

01:44.687 --> 01:46.898
There's Ice Pick Rick,
Zombie Killer Cain...

01:47.315 --> 01:49.776
The nastiest killers
this city has had to offer.

01:49.943 --> 01:50.777
You think?

01:51.444 --> 01:53.196
I think Seattle's seen worse.

01:55.698 --> 01:57.867
You don't want to know
what I had to do to get this brain.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.953
You want me to blue brain it? Or...

02:00.662 --> 02:02.914
-It's my $100,000 gift to you.

02:02.997 --> 02:05.667
-No.

02:05.917 --> 02:08.378
If you bought a brain for 100 grand
and I'm the one eating it,

02:08.461 --> 02:10.130
there's no way
it's gonna be anything good.

02:10.255 --> 02:11.297
You're gonna love it.

02:11.631 --> 02:12.632
But, first,

02:13.258 --> 02:14.634
let me show you something.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.427
You remember
when I was on that real-estate agent brain

02:16.511 --> 02:17.428
a couple weeks ago?

02:17.846 --> 02:19.764
Yeah. You were asking me
all those non-sequitur questions

02:19.973 --> 02:21.850
aimed at determining my annual income.

02:22.308 --> 02:23.935
That's when this plan came to me.

02:24.310 --> 02:27.480
This place on Kittitas sold for 22.6 mil.

02:27.814 --> 02:28.731
It's on the market now for two.

02:29.399 --> 02:30.358
No surprise there.

02:30.692 --> 02:33.570
The prices took a dive
after Seattle became the Lost City of Z.

02:33.695 --> 02:37.240
Well, figure 20% down,
you're looking at an outlay of 400,000

02:37.323 --> 02:39.075
on a house worth more than 20 mil.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.578
There's 100 properties
like this inside the wall.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.204
And when things return to normal,

02:43.705 --> 02:45.373
property values are gonna skyrocket.

02:45.456 --> 02:48.501
And whoever owns 'em cheap
will be filthy rich.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.463
You think things are returning to normal?

02:52.797 --> 02:55.675
Just eat the brain
and trust that I have a plan.

02:56.634 --> 02:58.303
Maybe you should lean back in your chair

02:58.386 --> 03:00.388
and do the Mr. Burns thing
with your hands.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.601
-Oh, yeah.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.019
And maybe cackle.

03:14.819 --> 03:18.740
Hmm...
Do you have the top half of a hairy arm,

03:18.990 --> 03:20.658
with a tattoo of a skull

03:20.742 --> 03:22.577
with a serpent
crawling out of its eye socket?

03:22.744 --> 03:23.745
Go fish.

03:27.498 --> 03:28.541
Oh!

03:46.517 --> 03:48.269
-No more victims. We're full.
-Ah!

04:13.169 --> 04:15.255
What can you tell us
about our human victim?

04:15.380 --> 04:16.506
Hmm.

04:37.652 --> 04:38.486
Okay.

04:42.699 --> 04:46.703
Go watch some Jerry Lewis movies,
you frog bastard.

05:05.888 --> 05:09.183
I'm sorry, Mr. Schwartzman,
my partner should be along soon.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.101
Ain't no thing.

05:11.519 --> 05:14.522
Hey, yo, them vending machines
you got upstairs is off the chain, though.

05:17.066 --> 05:20.320
Baked from scratch.

05:38.921 --> 05:40.214
Where'd you get this?

05:40.590 --> 05:43.426
Treasures abound
in the lost

05:45.595 --> 05:47.972
Mr. Schwartzman, this is Liv Moore,

05:48.473 --> 05:50.016
our medical examiner.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.184
'Sup, shawty?

05:51.809 --> 05:53.269
What is good?

05:53.394 --> 05:55.688
On my grind, you know.
Gettin' that schmoney. So, Weston, you and your brother Walden

06:00.276 --> 06:02.361
were originally a rap duo,
is that correct?

06:02.487 --> 06:05.281
Uh-uh. Lil' Driz and Dirty Reign.

06:05.448 --> 06:08.326
The Precipitation Collaboration.

06:08.451 --> 06:09.410
Tight.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.829
And when a manager
signed your brother and not you,

06:11.954 --> 06:13.164
your brother went solo. True?

06:13.289 --> 06:15.374
Oh, I see how you playin' it now.

06:15.666 --> 06:16.542
No comment.

06:18.336 --> 06:19.921
I pulled up these lyrics

06:20.046 --> 06:21.798
for a diss track you wrote
about your brother.

06:22.924 --> 06:25.635
"You a bad seed, son,

06:26.260 --> 06:28.930
rhymes corny as they come,
used to be chill,

06:29.013 --> 06:32.475
now you got a swole head,
like Icarus flyin' in the sun.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.685
You say you come dirty, Reign,

06:35.019 --> 06:37.021
but it's all just doom and gloom.

06:37.396 --> 06:39.315
You whack, you stale,

06:39.899 --> 06:41.776
I shoulda ate you in the womb."

06:41.901 --> 06:44.612
-Damn, that's cold.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.921
I'm just gonna say it. I love dead people.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.635
You're a necrophiliac, dude,
and this is how it ends.

07:08.136 --> 07:08.970
Bang.

07:10.638 --> 07:11.472
Good stuff?

07:11.597 --> 07:14.308
I saw Reign and his lady
at The Scratching Post.

07:14.642 --> 07:16.352
Some hater was throwin' mad shade.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.938
-Yeah, somewhere. He was...

07:21.232 --> 07:23.943
He's right behind you. That's our killer!

07:26.070 --> 07:27.989
Aren't his pieces currently
strewn about the morgue?

07:28.072 --> 07:28.906
The Scratching Post has

07:28.990 --> 07:30.908
only been letting humans in
for a few weeks.

07:31.075 --> 07:32.118
My vision has to be recent,

07:32.243 --> 07:35.246
and that guy was in prison
before The Scratching Post even opened.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.123
Then he must have escaped
from the bus massacre.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.541
Who is this guy?

07:40.418 --> 07:41.836
"Ronnie 'Sugar' Cain."

07:41.961 --> 07:44.755
"AKA Zombie Killer Cain.
Convicted murderer of nine."

07:45.923 --> 07:47.300
Better make that 11.

07:53.723 --> 07:57.560
So what's a zombie hater
doing hanging out at The Scratching Post?

07:57.643 --> 08:00.104
Well, you're hunting zombies,
you go to their watering hole.

08:00.354 --> 08:02.899
Maybe we go over there,
see if anyone remembers the guy?

08:03.024 --> 08:04.275
Sure. Let's do it.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.528
You know who the first
two zombies Cain killed were?

08:08.613 --> 08:09.780
His wife and daughter.

08:10.406 --> 08:12.950
At his trial he said
he considered them already dead.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.870
I'ma text my posse.

08:16.078 --> 08:18.789
We was hittin' a movie,
and this Cain fool was making me miss it.

08:19.207 --> 08:22.210
I was about to go ham
on a large tub with extra butter.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.756
"A citywide lockdown
is immediately in effect

08:26.839 --> 08:29.050
as Fillmore-Graves conducts a manhunt

08:29.175 --> 08:30.927
for serial killer Ronnie 'Sugar' Cain."

08:31.219 --> 08:33.179
Fillmore-Graves can declare
martial law now?

08:33.304 --> 08:34.138
I was gonna get me

08:34.222 --> 08:36.557
some of those
Scratching Post jalapeno brain poppers.

08:36.682 --> 08:39.227
My snack game is officially DOA.

08:39.310 --> 08:41.479
There are some new
vending machines on the fifth floor.

08:41.771 --> 08:43.189
People are making a big deal about them.

08:43.564 --> 08:44.398
For reals?

08:44.524 --> 08:45.900
One of the machines are zombie-friendly.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.318
Liv out.

08:53.449 --> 08:54.992
Let's do it.

08:59.997 --> 09:01.332
We should let Mosco know.

09:01.457 --> 09:02.917
-Texting him now.

09:07.505 --> 09:08.839
I got a bone to pick with Blaine.

09:08.923 --> 09:11.300
Oh, hello, Candy. Don't you look...

09:15.680 --> 09:17.306
You said,
"Hello, Candy. Don't you look..."

09:17.807 --> 09:20.101
And then you did that. Focus, Sinead.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.937
I think I'm on virgin brain.

09:23.854 --> 09:25.356
Oh. Did Blaine really tell the Mayor

09:25.481 --> 09:27.149
he could have me on the house,
and we'd go all night?

09:28.859 --> 09:30.278
Yes. In fairness,

09:31.153 --> 09:32.446
the whole city is on lockdown.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.907
So, it's not as if you could leave anyway.

09:35.032 --> 09:38.119
So I may as well just stay here

09:38.536 --> 09:41.455
and spank Mayor Freakfest
for eight hours? Hi.

09:42.498 --> 09:44.208
Is that what's happening?

09:44.792 --> 09:47.587
Blaine always has a good reason
for doing what he does.

09:47.670 --> 09:50.423
I usually just motorboat with it.

09:52.091 --> 09:53.259
I hate New Seattle.

09:54.176 --> 09:56.137
I wish the whole country
would just go zombie already.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.139
I was almost through
flight-attendant training.

09:58.514 --> 09:59.432
And now this!

10:01.642 --> 10:03.644
Hi. Did you miss me?

10:06.814 --> 10:08.316
<i> Blaine DeBeers,</i>

10:08.441 --> 10:09.358
you are

10:09.900 --> 10:13.863
as cunning as you are handsome.

10:14.238 --> 10:18.075
You've figured out a way
to turn the whole country zombie.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.327
Once that happens,

10:19.452 --> 10:21.829
all the properties
we're going to buy dirt cheap

10:21.912 --> 10:23.998
skyrocket in value.

10:29.211 --> 10:30.171
Have a seat, pal,

10:31.213 --> 10:32.965
because the fun doesn't stop there.

10:35.676 --> 10:36.927
I have another gift for you.

10:39.096 --> 10:40.556
Holy motherboard.

10:42.224 --> 10:43.601
It's a Boldbook.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.772
A 4K touch-screen precision display,

10:47.855 --> 10:50.107
gunmetal chassis and a hyper-charged SSD

10:50.191 --> 10:52.234
that makes its Y-Series brethren

10:53.069 --> 10:54.362
look like a little...

10:56.072 --> 10:57.490
B-word.

11:00.618 --> 11:04.080
Wait a minute. You sprang
for the optional Core i7 CPU?

11:04.372 --> 11:05.206
Mmm-hmm.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.377
Will you judge me if I happy

11:09.752 --> 11:11.504
-Yes.
-Then I won't.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.340
Hey!

11:15.674 --> 11:16.592
You'll get it back.

11:18.719 --> 11:19.887
I need your full attention.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.972
We're going to auction off
ten zombie cures

11:22.056 --> 11:23.974
to the highest bidders on the Dark Web.

11:24.725 --> 11:27.269
We need to make sure
that no one can ever trace it back to us.

11:27.561 --> 11:30.147
And that's where you come in.

11:31.148 --> 11:34.568
You now have the ability
to make us invisible, impenetrable.

11:34.693 --> 11:37.154
I paid a lot of money
to turn you into a computer genius.

11:37.279 --> 11:39.323
Prove to me that it was
money well spent, huh?

Fish sticks! Hi, Liv. We're here!

12:00.010 --> 12:02.096
Hey, my bizzles! You didn't get my text?

12:02.221 --> 12:05.182
Oh, we were closer to here
than home when the sirens went off, so...

12:07.768 --> 12:08.978
Rapper brain?

12:09.854 --> 12:11.230
Zombie Killer Cain capped his ass.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.482
Zombie Killer Cain is loose.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.359
He made it off the bus?

12:15.443 --> 12:16.902
Seems like he got his hands on a shotgun

12:16.986 --> 12:18.571
and got right back to work
killing zombies.

12:19.071 --> 12:22.074
-Hence the lockdown.
-That's a real dead body.

12:22.408 --> 12:23.284
There's more where that came from.

12:26.078 --> 12:28.038
-Oh, he's getting his nap on

12:28.122 --> 12:29.290
in the detective bunk room.

12:29.623 --> 12:31.459
-Oh, I told Isobel she's our neighbor...

12:31.584 --> 12:32.585
...if anyone asks.

12:34.462 --> 12:35.880
Oh, speaking of dead weight.

12:36.464 --> 12:37.423
Where the hell is the mayor?

12:37.548 --> 12:39.758
I need him to make
an official statement about the lockdown.

12:40.050 --> 12:42.553
-Your boss is a triflin' ass-chimp.

12:42.678 --> 12:44.472
Hi. Yeah, I have no idea where he is.

12:44.555 --> 12:45.806
How'd he die?

12:46.098 --> 12:47.808
Shotgun blast right to the chest.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.186
-Word.

12:50.394 --> 12:52.521
Oh, man, that's gross.

12:54.398 --> 12:57.276
Every Fillmore-Graves soldier
is gonna be out there hunting for Cain.

12:57.651 --> 13:00.070
All right? I want our unit
to be the one to bring him in.

13:00.529 --> 13:01.363
Major. A word?

13:03.616 --> 13:04.450
Yes, sir.

13:10.331 --> 13:12.583
Bring me up to speed
on our friend, Russ Roche.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.251
I'm making progress.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.295
He took me out with his crew.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.631
We busted up a few brain stills.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.049
Roughed up his competition.

13:20.508 --> 13:21.342
Great. Keep at it.

13:23.594 --> 13:25.429
Sir, if I may ask,

13:25.596 --> 13:27.264
how the hell did Cain escape?

13:27.389 --> 13:30.017
A zombie horde attacked
a prison transport bus.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.478
Cain was on the bus,
and somehow he got away.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.939
Any chance that horde was
from the Triple Cross Church?

13:35.272 --> 13:36.357
"Triple Cross" what?

13:36.524 --> 13:37.816
A church for zombies.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.568
The preachers work them into a lather.

13:39.652 --> 13:40.486
My unit dropped in

13:40.611 --> 13:42.279
when we were
tracking down that phone video.

13:42.738 --> 13:44.156
We almost didn't make it out alive.

13:48.911 --> 13:51.038
Why am I just hearing about this now?

13:51.872 --> 13:54.917
I can't do my job if I don't know
what's going on in this city!

13:56.252 --> 13:58.003
I put it all in the report, sir.

13:58.420 --> 13:59.630
I left nothing out.

14:00.297 --> 14:01.465
I never saw it.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.051
-It wasn't misplaced.

14:04.134 --> 14:06.011
It was withheld from me deliberately.

14:10.474 --> 14:12.518
I'm not sure
who I can count on here, Major.

14:18.148 --> 14:19.692
But I'm sure I can count on you.

14:21.777 --> 14:22.611
Of course.

14:28.534 --> 14:29.994
All right. Let's head out.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.704
-Yeah, but--

14:32.204 --> 14:33.539
That was my locker.

14:40.504 --> 14:41.714
-Hey, Ravi.
<i>-Major.</i>

14:41.839 --> 14:43.257
I forgot my briefcase this morning.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.593
Would you mind picking it up,
bringing it by the station?

14:45.676 --> 14:47.803
Yeah, sure.
'Cause I've got nothing else to do.

14:47.928 --> 14:49.388
I'm sorry to be a pain.

14:49.471 --> 14:51.765
It's just, it's vital
to something I'm working on.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.684
Well, patrol will take me
right by the house.

14:53.767 --> 14:56.353
Oh, splendid!
You're a savior. Thanks, mate!

14:56.604 --> 14:57.438
<i>Yeah, later.</i>

15:02.359 --> 15:03.819
He will bear it hither!

15:04.153 --> 15:05.446
Mosco Bandiwax,

15:05.654 --> 15:08.032
a resourceful halfling
if there ever was one.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.992
So then, adventurers,

15:10.326 --> 15:11.952
shall we commence?

15:12.161 --> 15:16.999
Too-rye, Too-rye, Too-rye, aye!

15:23.255 --> 15:25.841
What's that you say,
amateur script kiddies?

15:25.925 --> 15:28.302
You can't get past my firewall?

15:28.385 --> 15:31.347
Well, eat my shorts!

15:31.972 --> 15:32.806
Hey, dweeb. How goes the auction prep?

15:34.558 --> 15:37.353
The packet filters on my DMZ
have more layers

15:37.686 --> 15:39.146
than the atmosphere.

15:39.271 --> 15:40.898
Which is five layers.

15:40.981 --> 15:44.234
Oh! Actually, six
if you include the ionosphere.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.320
-It...
-Bottom-line me.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.281
Our auction is impenetrable
to law enforcement,

15:49.365 --> 15:52.034
and no one will ever be able
to trace it back to us.

15:52.159 --> 15:53.577
That is music to my ears.

15:54.745 --> 15:56.413
Oh, just, quick question.

15:56.538 --> 15:57.748
Under the heading,

15:58.415 --> 16:00.459
"you probably already
thought about this..."

16:01.502 --> 16:02.962
Why would anyone bid on

16:03.045 --> 16:05.881
one of these cures
without proof that they're effective?

16:06.006 --> 16:08.926
Obviously we're going to cure a zombie
on camera for all the world to see,

16:09.009 --> 16:11.804
and then kill him in a way
that only a human can die.

16:13.430 --> 16:14.264
Duh.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.016
Of course.

16:16.183 --> 16:17.309
Just one more thing.

16:17.476 --> 16:20.062
How exactly will people know that our

16:20.604 --> 16:23.816
subject wasn't simply human to begin with?

16:23.941 --> 16:27.111
I guess we'll have to find
ourselves a well

16:27.236 --> 16:28.070
Oh.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.329
Oh, my God. This is gnarly.

16:38.455 --> 16:41.375
They're running prints to help us
put the bodies back together again.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.210
Hey, Liv.

16:44.211 --> 16:46.296
Yo. Why you rolling up?

16:46.714 --> 16:48.757
Looking for Ravi.
I'm supposed to bring him this.

16:49.591 --> 16:51.093
Hey, there. I'm Major.

16:51.218 --> 16:52.678
-Hello, sir.
"Sir"?

16:53.137 --> 16:54.638
Bitch, please. This is just Major.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.974
Major, this is my neighbor, Isobel.

16:57.599 --> 17:00.310
-And Ravi, he's--
-Somewhere. Not here.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.398
Major, Seattle is getting
on my last nerve.

17:04.481 --> 17:06.150
I told you to wait upstairs.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.278
So now you just
walk away in the middle of a conversation?

17:10.320 --> 17:11.238
Ugh!

17:11.363 --> 17:12.614
They're hands. Man up.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.950
Hey, you two are getting on my last nerve.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.368
They got beef, Major.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.162
Let 'em sort it out.

17:18.537 --> 17:19.496
What's your situation, son?

17:19.747 --> 17:22.750
I thought we had something,
but apparently we were just hooking up.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.418
I never said we were exclusive.

17:24.543 --> 17:25.711
Your body made a promise.

17:25.836 --> 17:28.505
<i>♪ Thought my boo was ride-or-die</i>
<i>Till I got the 411 ♪ </i>

17:28.630 --> 17:30.132
<i>♪ 'Cause he just a blank-faced coward ♪ </i>

17:30.257 --> 17:32.217
<i>♪ With a narrow mind and a big-ass gun ♪ </i>

17:32.509 --> 17:34.970
Liv, I know you're on a brain,
but seriously,

17:35.471 --> 17:36.430
what's your problem?

17:36.722 --> 17:40.100
-Wait in the lobby!

17:50.069 --> 17:51.445
You were right there

17:51.570 --> 17:53.864
when Chase Graves
crushed Mama Leone's skull.

17:54.114 --> 17:56.116
You probably had to wash
bits of her off of you.

17:56.241 --> 18:00.245
Renegade was breaking the law
and fully aware of the consequences.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.915
Her death, while tragic,
probably saves lives.

18:03.082 --> 18:03.957
Hey, Major.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.794
I've seen that movie, too.
You're quoting the bad guy.

18:06.877 --> 18:09.671
Will you two knock it off?
You both love each other.

18:10.756 --> 18:13.675
You've been through tough stuff before,
and this, too, shall pass.

18:17.429 --> 18:18.263
It's Ravi.

18:20.015 --> 18:21.391
We should do this more often.

18:29.149 --> 18:31.777
P. Charles to DocChak.

18:32.528 --> 18:33.737
"Hey, babe."

18:33.862 --> 18:35.239
Blaine, are you sure you want to do this?

18:35.322 --> 18:37.866
Reading your ex's e-mails
seems like a slippery slope.

18:37.991 --> 18:39.785
I paid a truckload
for that brain you're on.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.203
Just give it to me.

18:42.704 --> 18:45.415
"I have to work a bit
on Saturday afternoon

18:45.541 --> 18:48.293
but I'm all yours before then.

18:48.669 --> 18:49.962
Let the sleep-in,

18:51.088 --> 18:52.339
snuggle-fest begin!"

18:52.464 --> 18:54.258
She used the words "snuggle

18:54.967 --> 18:56.051
Is that even a thing?

18:56.135 --> 18:58.303
Maybe it's their thing?

18:59.596 --> 19:02.224
The guy is a British yeti.
Just looking at him makes me itchy.

19:02.558 --> 19:03.934
What does she see in him?

19:04.685 --> 19:05.936
I found this guy

19:06.478 --> 19:08.021
passed out next to our dumpster.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.067
-You look how I feel, brother.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.153
Call Fillmore-Graves.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.155
Have someone come
pick the drunk bastard up.

19:16.488 --> 19:17.364
Will do.

19:20.075 --> 19:22.661
When the right woman comes along,
you won't hurt anymore.

19:22.995 --> 19:23.871
Take it from me.

19:24.037 --> 19:26.540
Five years happily married
to my best friend.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.669
The walking waterfall has a wife?

19:32.171 --> 19:35.716
Yeah, and he's insanely jealous.

19:35.841 --> 19:39.303
His wife is built like Jessica Rabbit,
so if she comes in here, don't.

19:40.721 --> 19:41.805
Just don't.

19:43.473 --> 19:46.101
We saw Ravi eating a brain tube.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.855
How is Peyton
sleeping with him if he's a zombie?

19:50.480 --> 19:51.899
And if he's not a zombie,

19:52.858 --> 19:53.692
what is he?

19:54.151 --> 19:55.777
I'm a halfling monk.

19:55.903 --> 19:58.906
People see halfling
and always think "thief."

19:59.031 --> 20:02.826
But, have you not noticed
the way I've played my character, hmm?

20:03.368 --> 20:04.203
The celibacy?

20:04.369 --> 20:06.872
The way I work
the teachings of Anubis into conversation?

20:07.039 --> 20:09.208
My lack of regard for worldly possessions?

20:09.333 --> 20:11.293
Well, you sure jumped on
those Bracers of Defense

20:11.376 --> 20:13.921
for someone who doesn't care
about worldly possessions.

20:15.964 --> 20:17.883
What news have you, Morrisey the Mage?

20:18.175 --> 20:20.594
I've studied the map we won

20:20.719 --> 20:22.596
in that game of knucklebones
with Ban-Yonn,

20:22.679 --> 20:24.139
the idiot of Knoforks.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.933
And without a thief,

20:26.266 --> 20:28.227
our mission is doomed.

20:31.605 --> 20:32.814
Fellow adventurers,

20:33.148 --> 20:35.484
I apologize for walking
into your camp unannounced,

20:35.609 --> 20:36.693
but I saw the fire,

20:36.860 --> 20:38.820
and I hoped
I might find fellowship as well.

20:38.946 --> 20:42.783
Um, I don't know what you saw,
but this isn't--

20:42.866 --> 20:46.161
I am Foxy Brown of Shondaland,

20:46.578 --> 20:48.247
the greatest thief in the realm.

20:49.498 --> 20:50.540
I'm sorry. Who?

20:51.583 --> 20:53.168
All my information's there.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.213
I seek wealth and adventure.

20:56.380 --> 20:57.381
Can I hear a "huzzah"?

20:57.798 --> 20:59.174
Huzzah.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.927
For Queen, for country!

21:02.552 --> 21:03.679
Huzzah!

21:06.431 --> 21:09.643
This character sheet
just has your name on it,

21:10.310 --> 21:12.604
and it says you have 200 hit points.

21:14.022 --> 21:16.066
It seemed like more was better.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.193
Okay. Fine. Have a seat.

21:19.403 --> 21:22.281
Hello. Ravi?

21:24.157 --> 21:26.910
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on in there? I heard huzzahs.

21:27.369 --> 21:30.080
Official police business.
Strictly need-to-know.

21:31.790 --> 21:32.666
Hmm.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.876
Quite a police emergency.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.796
So I guess Sirjay decided to
sit this one out, huh?

21:38.922 --> 21:40.799
What with the lockdown, you know...

21:41.675 --> 21:43.176
Open the briefcase, Ravi.

21:54.896 --> 21:55.939
Huzzah?

21:57.733 --> 22:00.319
So, you know, I'm out on the streets
trying to catch a murderer.

22:01.737 --> 22:02.988
I catch a murderer every week.

22:04.197 --> 22:05.532
Did you know Peyton's downstairs?

22:05.782 --> 22:06.616
She is?

22:06.742 --> 22:08.577
But you're gonna stay
and play though, right?

22:08.702 --> 22:11.288
-Hmm.
-Be your own man, Mosco.

22:11.705 --> 22:13.665
She'll understand you
staying here, playing <i>D&amp;D</i>

22:13.749 --> 22:15.292
while you know she's downstairs.

22:15.917 --> 22:17.794
How will she know I'm playing <i>D&amp;D?</i>

22:18.045 --> 22:20.005
Oh, she'll get the text
I'm sending right now.

22:22.090 --> 22:25.635
Peyton
What a marvelous nap! I feel so refreshed.

22:37.272 --> 22:39.191
Hey, Mom. Thanks for checking in.

22:44.029 --> 22:46.156
It's good. I'm hanging out
with the girls today.

22:46.239 --> 22:47.532
Maybe catching a movie later.

22:52.871 --> 22:54.664
Uh... Mom, can I call you back?

22:55.582 --> 22:56.416
<i>Isobel?</i>

23:02.964 --> 23:04.424
And who might you be?

23:05.926 --> 23:06.760
-Isobel.
-Ah.

23:07.844 --> 23:09.221
Nice to meet you, Isobel.

23:10.555 --> 23:11.598
I assume

23:11.848 --> 23:13.975
you weren't dead before I arrived.

23:14.434 --> 23:15.268
No.

23:15.685 --> 23:17.896
So you haven't somehow
sprung back to life? Because that would be
cause for celebration.

23:20.315 --> 23:21.149
Uh-uh.

23:21.316 --> 23:22.818
Perhaps you've always been alive,

23:22.901 --> 23:24.027
but were mistaken for dead.

23:24.319 --> 23:26.154
-Nope.
-I give up, then.

23:27.114 --> 23:28.698
I'm Liv and Peyton's neighbor.

23:29.032 --> 23:30.867
They were gonna take me
to the movies tonight.

23:31.159 --> 23:32.744
Then the lockdown happened.

23:32.953 --> 23:34.996
-Fifth floor.

23:35.163 --> 23:37.582
Ah. Of course. Snacks.

23:37.999 --> 23:40.335
And so, with the morgue to yourself,

23:40.418 --> 23:44.172
you decided to climb in
one of the drawers where we keep the dead?

23:44.464 --> 23:47.008
Seems strange without context,

23:47.425 --> 23:48.635
-Yeah.

23:49.678 --> 23:51.138
I'd love to hear the context.

23:54.474 --> 23:55.892
Snacks in the hizzouse!

23:55.976 --> 23:57.435
Sorry it took so long.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.729
-Hey! Look who I met.

24:00.438 --> 24:03.275
Did you know your neighbor
is certifiably brilliant?

24:03.400 --> 24:04.234
True dat.

24:07.779 --> 24:09.364
Text from your other girlfriend?

24:10.490 --> 24:14.202
What does
Miss Cheyenne Longneckings require?

24:14.327 --> 24:19.124
"Mosco Bandiwax fell to his death
in the Cavern of Nasty Pricks."

24:20.375 --> 24:21.960
Does that mean anything to anyone?

24:22.377 --> 24:24.296
Only to a little old
halfling lady in Mirkwood

24:24.462 --> 24:27.674
who will have one less mince pie to bake
during the Feast of Belbuck.

24:40.103 --> 24:42.355
-Lady Pursella, we have returned.

24:42.731 --> 24:43.773
Our quest is complete.

24:44.149 --> 24:46.359
We bring you
the head of the bandit Sh-Krelly,

24:46.860 --> 24:49.529
the hostages he held
and the crown he stole.

24:52.199 --> 24:54.284
I see you lost one of your compatriots.

24:54.367 --> 24:56.703
No great loss, Your Highness.
I assure you.

24:57.996 --> 24:59.164
For your valor,

24:59.539 --> 25:01.958
I present each of you a jewel. -It's called an Apple Emerald.
-Oh.

25:04.669 --> 25:07.297
Obviously, named for the size
and not the hue.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.594
So I guess this is where we'll wrap.

25:13.970 --> 25:14.804
Wait.

25:15.222 --> 25:17.265
We're spending some time
here in the castle?

25:17.557 --> 25:19.100
-Yep.
-Okay.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.937
On night one, I break into
Morrisey and Sir Choppers' rooms

25:22.020 --> 25:23.563
and I steal their Apple Emeralds.

25:24.189 --> 25:25.357
Wait. She can't do that!

25:25.482 --> 25:28.985
I buried mine out in the field
during my morning ride.

25:29.194 --> 25:30.195
No, you didn't.

25:30.278 --> 25:31.738
No, I said something about this earlier.

25:31.821 --> 25:34.282
I said, "Every day I bury my treasure."

25:34.449 --> 25:35.450
We could check the tape.

25:42.374 --> 25:43.541
No. Mmm-mmm.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.293
That recording must be destroyed.

25:45.418 --> 25:46.253
Oh, you're being silly.

25:46.336 --> 25:48.296
All the detectives here
are going to love it.

25:48.546 --> 25:50.632
All of YouTube is going to love it.

25:50.715 --> 25:53.510
If that's your plan,
just take my gun and shoot me.

25:54.469 --> 25:55.887
That's a little dramatic, don't you think?

25:55.971 --> 25:57.931
You're telling me
I'm gonna be the <i>Star Wars</i> kid,

25:58.014 --> 25:59.516
and I shouldn't be concerned?

26:00.392 --> 26:03.770
Well, there's concerned,
and then there's asking for death by cop.

26:07.190 --> 26:08.984
Oh, come on, is that the best you got?

26:24.499 --> 26:25.667
You forgot this.

26:31.881 --> 26:32.716
We were just...

26:33.049 --> 26:35.927
What happens in the Misty Dunes
stays in the Misty Dunes.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.434
I didn't mean for that to happen.

26:43.143 --> 26:44.227
But it did.

26:45.770 --> 26:48.106
So I went to the zoo on Freebie Friday.

26:48.315 --> 26:49.524
-It was weird.

26:49.607 --> 26:51.318
They keep the bald eagles in cages.

26:51.401 --> 26:52.235
Why would you keep

26:52.319 --> 26:54.612
the symbol of American freedom
in captivity?

26:54.738 --> 26:57.157
You know, with this lockdown,
we're all kinda bald eagles tonight.

26:57.240 --> 26:58.450
And with the wall up,

26:59.034 --> 27:01.995
we're actually bald eagles all the time.

27:02.495 --> 27:03.663
-Yeah.

27:04.581 --> 27:05.415
Company.

27:08.001 --> 27:09.127
I'll get the package.

27:10.045 --> 27:11.129
I hear you have something of ours.

27:11.254 --> 27:12.297
We're getting it.

27:16.885 --> 27:19.262
Is that Lil' Bones Jones?

27:19.387 --> 27:21.556
-You mean Major Jones.
-Major Jones

27:21.681 --> 27:24.642
with a major booze jones, Major Major.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.145
Where's Good?

27:27.520 --> 27:28.480
Out in the Humvee.

27:28.855 --> 27:29.814
Hup!

27:30.523 --> 27:31.358
You're welcome.

27:32.025 --> 27:33.443
Damn it. Jumped the gun.

27:34.110 --> 27:35.737
I should've waited for the "thank you."

27:35.820 --> 27:36.654
Tell you what.

27:36.780 --> 27:39.157
I'll trade you two
annoying, baby-faced soldiers

27:39.240 --> 27:40.575
for one workhorse goon.

27:43.953 --> 27:45.538
-I'm good.
-Uncool, man.

27:45.663 --> 27:47.374
Oh. No.
No, I wasn't talking about you two.

27:47.457 --> 27:49.834
It was two other soldiers.
You guys don't know them.

27:53.588 --> 27:55.465
All I'm saying is I really like you.

27:55.548 --> 27:56.925
-You shouldn't.

27:57.842 --> 27:58.968
You don't like me?

28:01.137 --> 28:02.347
Where's that water?

28:06.684 --> 28:08.853
Here you go.
You should drink ten of these.

28:15.693 --> 28:17.987
I'm hungry. I need a brain tube.

28:18.530 --> 28:19.697
Use my card.

28:23.118 --> 28:24.244
Where's my ID?

28:27.122 --> 28:28.081
With respect,

28:28.373 --> 28:30.291
you gotta get a handle
on your drinking, sir.

28:30.625 --> 28:31.459
Losing your ID--

28:31.584 --> 28:32.836
I wasn't drinking.

28:34.170 --> 28:35.463
Did it just fall out? Major, he's bleeding.

28:37.715 --> 28:39.134
-Someone must've clocked him.

28:40.135 --> 28:40.969
Who hit you?

28:41.136 --> 28:42.137
I don't remember.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.099
Oh, no.

28:47.183 --> 28:48.184
What is it?

28:48.935 --> 28:50.729
Well, he's got
level-five security clearance.

28:50.895 --> 28:52.856
His ID authorizes entry
into any area of this building.

28:53.732 --> 28:54.816
Go find Justin in the armory.

28:54.941 --> 28:56.651
Tell him to lock down the campus!

29:09.164 --> 29:11.583
I guess they'll need to call back
during office hours.

29:20.258 --> 29:21.426
It probably would have been easier

29:21.509 --> 29:24.095
to drop your grievances
in the comment box.

29:24.220 --> 29:25.054
Stand up.

29:33.146 --> 29:34.147
Over there.

29:40.487 --> 29:41.404
Sit.

29:53.666 --> 29:55.210
I had this dog named Rocky.

29:56.836 --> 29:58.338
I loved him so much.

29:59.672 --> 30:01.257
One day he wasn't acting right.

30:02.467 --> 30:03.927
He got real aggressive.

30:04.844 --> 30:06.012
Started drooling.

30:09.349 --> 30:11.392
Limped around like...

30:21.486 --> 30:23.112
I waited too long to put him down.

30:23.738 --> 30:25.073
I watched him suffer.

30:25.865 --> 30:28.034
Finally, I took him out back
and I shot him.

30:30.662 --> 30:31.663
Was that wrong?

30:32.539 --> 30:33.915
Could Rocky do long division?

30:35.124 --> 30:36.292
You see what I'm getting at? I can.

30:36.417 --> 30:38.336
You killed Cynthia and Georgie!

30:39.337 --> 30:41.422
I may have put the buckshot
in their heads,

30:41.506 --> 30:43.007
but you killed them!

30:43.216 --> 30:44.551
I didn't wanna watch them suffer.

30:45.635 --> 30:47.637
I don't think any zombie should suffer.

30:49.556 --> 30:51.224
Do I look like I'm suffering?

30:55.645 --> 30:57.647
Why was I the one in prison, Chase?

30:58.398 --> 30:59.482
Why?

31:00.024 --> 31:01.150
You're the mass murderer.

31:02.652 --> 31:04.195
I've killed so many. You're gonna be number...

31:06.322 --> 31:08.616
Uh... You know what? I've lost count.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.578
And that's only if you count
putting a zombie out of his misery.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.037
Which I don't!

31:13.872 --> 31:15.874
You killed 10,000 human beings.

31:16.499 --> 31:18.793
I mean, wow.

31:28.553 --> 31:30.972
Go check the school dorm!
He might've gone there first!

31:39.397 --> 31:40.690
Nobody gank my taquitos.

31:40.773 --> 31:43.318
-They take 15 minutes.

31:43.443 --> 31:45.612
Because the machine bakes them
especially for you.

31:45.987 --> 31:48.072
-And that's what they say.
-I want in on that.

31:49.032 --> 31:50.992
Cookies on me.
Grab as many as you can with that.

31:51.117 --> 31:52.535
She won't be able to carry that many.

31:52.869 --> 31:54.329
Well, how 'bout you join her?

31:54.704 --> 31:56.623
I have work stuff to discuss with Liv.

31:58.041 --> 32:00.251
Okay. You got it. Come on, Isobel.

32:06.466 --> 32:08.176
Isobel has Freylich Syndrome.

32:08.593 --> 32:09.886
It's a death sentence.

32:10.011 --> 32:11.596
Victims rarely see their 18th birthday.

32:13.848 --> 32:16.559
I found her testing out a morgue drawer.
It came up pretty quickly.

32:16.684 --> 32:19.062
Scratching humans
is a capital offense, you know.

32:19.854 --> 32:20.855
I know.

32:22.106 --> 32:24.067
And it would be completely unfair of me

32:24.150 --> 32:26.277
to ask you to put
your life on the line. So...

32:27.612 --> 32:29.614
I'll do it.
During my next bout of the zombies.

32:29.739 --> 32:30.907
-Ravi...
-We can feed her

32:30.990 --> 32:31.950
with brains from the morgue.

32:32.033 --> 32:33.326
Please, don't try and talk me out of this.

32:33.409 --> 32:35.411
I'm not gonna try to talk you out of it.

32:35.662 --> 32:36.663
-No.

32:37.705 --> 32:40.249
Because I already scratched her.
And it didn't take.

32:40.333 --> 32:41.501
Wait, what?

32:42.669 --> 32:43.586
That's impossible.

32:43.920 --> 32:44.879
It's not.

32:46.214 --> 32:48.549
I tried it, I had other zombies try.

32:49.550 --> 32:52.136
-Isobel is immune.
-I don't understand.

32:53.846 --> 32:56.182
I read an article
on false immunity outliers.

32:57.558 --> 32:59.978
It just doesn't make sense.
Could it be genetic?

33:00.144 --> 33:02.480
Maybe. Isobel's had
several experimental treatments.

33:02.563 --> 33:04.190
Maybe one of those caused her immunity.

33:04.315 --> 33:05.650
Or altered her brain chemistry somehow.

33:05.775 --> 33:08.152
Whatever the reason,
she's never gonna be a zombie.

33:09.404 --> 33:10.405
She's gonna die.

33:12.198 --> 33:13.783
There's nothing we can do about it.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.329
Then we need to study her,

33:18.913 --> 33:20.707
figure out what makes her immune.

33:20.915 --> 33:22.875
Maybe she's the key to finding a vaccine.

33:23.126 --> 33:24.711
Can I call you right back, Mom?

33:31.843 --> 33:35.263
Did you want chocolate chip
or oatmeal raisin?

33:38.099 --> 33:42.228
And the king of Bremerton!

33:42.311 --> 33:44.522
Whoa.

33:48.359 --> 33:50.361
-Mr. Mayor!

33:50.445 --> 33:54.532
Don E. and I had an inspired
idea for the remainder of the lockdown.

33:54.949 --> 33:56.242
I love it already.

33:56.534 --> 33:59.078
We're calling it
<i>"La Petite Mort </i>Masquerade."

33:59.162 --> 34:03.624
And I'm sure you know
what "little death" we're talking about.

34:03.708 --> 34:05.501
Oh.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.129
Candy and the girls
already have their masks.

34:08.212 --> 34:09.589
We'll pick yours out in a minute.

34:10.298 --> 34:12.717
It's kind of a group project.

34:12.884 --> 34:15.178
Ooh. "A group project." Yeah!

34:15.261 --> 34:17.388
You are speaking my language.

34:17.597 --> 34:20.016
And it all starts
with a little pick-me-up.

34:20.641 --> 34:23.269
What is it

34:23.436 --> 34:24.270
It's better!

34:24.812 --> 34:26.814
It's like Molly, China Girl and U-Boat

34:26.898 --> 34:28.191
had a threesome in your brain.

34:28.775 --> 34:29.942
And right after you snort it,

34:30.026 --> 34:34.280
I'm gonna give you a little
vitamin cocktail injection in your booty,

34:34.363 --> 34:37.742
so that you'll be in tip-top shape
for your mayoral duties tomorrow.

34:37.825 --> 34:39.786
Always thinking, boys!

34:39.911 --> 34:41.662
Always thinking!

34:42.622 --> 34:43.539
Would you take a seat?

34:43.873 --> 34:46.417
Wow. We are really going
all out on this one.

34:46.626 --> 34:48.836
For the mayor of New Seattle,
the sky's the limit.

34:49.587 --> 34:50.880
That is quite a map.

34:51.547 --> 34:53.716
I'm thinking of investing
in some real estate.

34:53.883 --> 34:55.760
-Oh...

34:55.927 --> 34:56.761
You ready?

34:57.637 --> 34:59.180
Well, you guys are doing it, too, right?

34:59.972 --> 35:01.182
Of course.

35:01.766 --> 35:02.767
All right.

35:06.729 --> 35:09.607
Oh, I like it.
That's good. Setting the mood.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.527
Feeling good

35:13.069 --> 35:13.986
Absolutely.

35:14.487 --> 35:15.321
Cheers.

35:20.660 --> 35:21.494
Oh!

35:24.914 --> 35:26.082
Oh, I feel funny.

35:27.667 --> 35:28.709
I think it's kicking in.

35:30.837 --> 35:32.088
Oh, my God.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.173
Oh, my God. I'm human again!

35:34.298 --> 35:36.509
I can feel it! How did you...

35:36.884 --> 35:38.219
I'm human again!

35:38.344 --> 35:39.512
I'm human again!

35:57.488 --> 35:59.699
Well, I thought that went well.

36:00.575 --> 36:02.994
Yeah, well, he didn't land on you.

36:09.417 --> 36:11.919
I got tired of waiting. So...

36:12.962 --> 36:14.839
I went with chocolate chip.

36:15.548 --> 36:18.009
Okay, something funky's going on.

36:19.427 --> 36:21.429
-Ravi should study me.
-I agree.

36:21.554 --> 36:23.389
-He can't.
Thanks, sweetie.

36:23.514 --> 36:25.725
-I'm staying in Seattle.
-We've been through this. You're not.

36:25.808 --> 36:26.809
Where else is she gonna go?

36:26.934 --> 36:28.686
-Home. She's going home.
-No, I'm not.

36:28.811 --> 36:29.770
-Boise.

36:29.896 --> 36:31.731
-Which is where she's going.

36:32.690 --> 36:33.941
I'm staying here.

36:34.859 --> 36:36.986
My dying wish is to be a guinea pig.

36:37.570 --> 36:39.405
You can't deny me my dying wish.

36:39.780 --> 36:41.657
Wait. How did you get into Seattle?

36:44.869 --> 36:46.537
-A coyote...
-Oh.

36:46.704 --> 36:48.664
-Isobel.
-...working for Liv.

36:49.832 --> 36:50.666
What?

36:51.751 --> 36:53.502
What does she mean,
"A coyote working for Liv"?

36:53.628 --> 36:55.922
-She meant a coyote that I know.
-No, I didn't.

36:56.756 --> 36:57.590
Ravi.

36:58.299 --> 37:00.301
Liv has taken over
Mama Leone's organization.

37:01.344 --> 37:04.096
Underground Railroad,
head

37:04.472 --> 37:05.806
-Yep.
-Thanks, Peyton.

37:05.932 --> 37:07.767
Look, I'm tired of keeping
this secret from Ravi.

37:08.351 --> 37:09.936
Your friends are trying to help you.

37:10.728 --> 37:11.646
We're the No Secrets Club.

37:11.771 --> 37:13.231
It's dangerous information.

37:13.814 --> 37:14.649
And you knew?

37:15.191 --> 37:16.651
For a few weeks. That's all.

37:16.776 --> 37:18.110
And you didn't tell me?

37:18.319 --> 37:20.154
She didn't volunteer
the information to me.

37:20.238 --> 37:21.322
I caught her red-handed

37:21.489 --> 37:23.157
making fake zombie ID cards

37:23.366 --> 37:24.325
for her clients.

37:32.375 --> 37:33.709
Your family is back in Boise?

37:33.834 --> 37:35.336
It's just my mom.

37:35.836 --> 37:37.755
No way I'm letting her make the trip here.

37:37.922 --> 37:39.674
-Then we should send you back.
-Look!

37:40.341 --> 37:41.425
I'm the one who's dying,

37:41.509 --> 37:44.178
and I get to decide what I do
with the rest of my short life.

37:44.470 --> 37:46.013
I'm staying in Seattle,

37:46.180 --> 37:49.433
so, please, study me.

37:49.642 --> 37:52.478
I wanna go out
knowing that my life had meaning.

37:55.856 --> 37:56.691
Lockdown's over.

37:56.774 --> 37:58.526
-They must have caught Cain.
-Thank God.

38:00.069 --> 38:01.654
-Let's all go home.
So...

38:02.113 --> 38:03.155
What about me?

38:09.120 --> 38:10.204
All clear in the dorm.

38:10.329 --> 38:11.330
The perimeter is clear.

38:12.790 --> 38:13.708
Well done, Major.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.167
-Yep.

38:16.043 --> 38:17.837
If I collect them all, I win a prize.

38:25.219 --> 38:27.096
You're aware Cain is back here?

38:27.388 --> 38:28.431
Sure am.

38:29.807 --> 38:32.226
-Barely.

38:32.518 --> 38:33.894
Should I get him medical attention?

38:34.186 --> 38:35.146
Let's do him one better.

38:35.604 --> 38:36.439
Scratch him.

38:49.744 --> 38:51.787
Just let me die.

38:53.497 --> 38:56.250
-Please.
-Scratch him, soldier. That's an order.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.503
He has an appointment with the guillotine.

39:23.444 --> 39:24.278
Detective.

39:29.158 --> 39:30.076
Inspector.

39:30.284 --> 39:33.037
Ah.<i> Madame</i> Acting Mayor.

39:34.163 --> 39:35.623
So, who's taking the lead on this?

39:35.956 --> 39:37.833
It's a strange case.

39:38.250 --> 39:39.168
What is he?

39:40.252 --> 39:41.796
Yesterday he was a zombie,

39:41.962 --> 39:44.548
but what zombie dies
from a bullet through the heart?

39:45.299 --> 39:47.134
Well, maybe this'll help.

39:49.011 --> 39:51.013
This popped up
all over the Web last night.

39:51.597 --> 39:53.724
No one's been able to
discover where it originated.

39:57.103 --> 39:57.937
<i>Oh!</i>

39:58.187 --> 40:00.314
<i>Oh, my God. I'm human again.</i>
<i>I can feel it!</i>

40:00.481 --> 40:01.315
<i>How did you...</i>

40:01.399 --> 40:02.608
<i>I'm human again!</i>

40:02.900 --> 40:04.068
<i>I'm human again!</i>

40:11.700 --> 40:12.576
Excellent!

40:12.827 --> 40:14.829
This is settled. He's human.

40:14.954 --> 40:16.288
The case is yours.

40:17.706 --> 40:18.791
Enjoy.
