WEBVTT

00:03.904 --> 00:05.573
* LAB RATS

00:05.606 --> 00:09.377
OKAY, NOW WE'LL CHECK
YOUR BIONIC REFLEXES.

00:09.410 --> 00:11.045
FIRST THE LEFT ARM.

00:11.079 --> 00:12.213
OHH!

00:14.848 --> 00:16.584
OKAY, NOW THE RIGHT ARM.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.319
OHH!

00:18.352 --> 00:20.354
OH, I HATE THIS GAME!

00:20.388 --> 00:22.223
OKAY, ADAM.
WELL, YOU CAN
SIT THIS ONE OUT.

00:22.256 --> 00:23.391
I'LL JUST DO BREE
AND CHASE.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.093
OHH!

00:27.495 --> 00:30.464
COME ON, BIG "D,"
IT'S SUMMER VACATION!

00:30.498 --> 00:31.299
LET'S HIT THE BEACH.

00:31.332 --> 00:33.401
SLAP ON SOME SHORTS
AND SHOW EVERYONE

00:33.434 --> 00:35.203
YOUR PASTY LITTLE
WALKING STICKS!

00:35.236 --> 00:36.604
NOT NOW, LEO.

00:36.637 --> 00:39.607
WE'RE DOING SOME ROUTINE
BIONIC CHIP MAINTENANCE.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.076
BESIDES, THIS IS FUN,
RIGHT, GUYS?

00:42.110 --> 00:43.277
A BLAST.ES.

00:43.311 --> 00:44.612
OKAY, ARE WE DONE HERE?

00:44.645 --> 00:47.248
I WANNA GO BE NORMAL
FOR A WHILE!

00:50.284 --> 00:53.487
CAN'T WE GO JUST
FIVE MINUTES WITHOUT
SOMETHING SPARKING,

00:53.521 --> 00:56.524
EXPLODING, OR OOZING
AROUND HERE?

00:58.359 --> 00:59.860
EVER SINCE SUMMER
VACATION STARTED,

00:59.893 --> 01:03.331
IT HAS BEEN LIKE
ONE LONG SCIENCE
EXPERIMENT.

01:03.364 --> 01:06.334
I'M SORRY, HONEY.
I... YOU KNOW...

01:06.367 --> 01:07.635
MAYBE...
MAYBE LEO'S RIGHT.

01:07.668 --> 01:10.404
MAYBE WE NEED
TO TAKE A BREAK
AND GO TO THE BEACH.

01:10.438 --> 01:11.472
YEAH!

01:11.505 --> 01:12.573
WE'LL TAKE A WHOLE WEEKEND,

01:12.606 --> 01:14.175
AS A NORMAL FAMILY,
YOU KNOW?

01:14.208 --> 01:16.110
NO GADGETS, NO PHONES.

01:16.144 --> 01:17.511
WE'LL DO IT
TOTALLY TECH-FREE.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.513
THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT I NEED.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.449
YOU WOULD REALLY
DO THAT FOR ME?

01:21.482 --> 01:24.218
OF COURSE. YOU ARE WAY
MORE IMPORTANT TO ME

01:24.252 --> 01:28.556
THAN THE AMAZING
INNOVATIONS BORN
OF MY GENIUS.

01:31.559 --> 01:34.128
WOW, BIG "D,"
IT'S REALLY NICE OF YOU

01:34.162 --> 01:35.563
TO BLOW OFF WORK
FOR MY MOM.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.665
WELL, YOU KNOW, LEO,
NOW AND THEN,

01:37.698 --> 01:40.301
EVERYBODY NEEDS
A LITTLE PEACE AND...

01:40.334 --> 01:42.370
( Klaxon blares )

01:42.403 --> 01:43.604
QUIET!

01:46.374 --> 01:48.342
IT'S THE EARLY WARNING
SATELLITE SYSTEM.

01:48.376 --> 01:50.578
IT'S DETECTING
A GIANT SOLAR FLARE.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.213
WHEN THAT THING
HITS THE ATMOSPHERE,

01:52.246 --> 01:53.481
IT'LL CAUSE MASSIVE
POWER FAILURES

01:53.514 --> 01:55.583
AND A TOTAL BLACKOUT
OF SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.618
OKAY, I SHOULD TELL
MY MOM WE'RE NOT GOING
TO THE BEACH, THEN.

01:57.651 --> 02:00.888
NO, NO, NO, NO.
DON'T TELL YOUR MOM
A THING ABOUT THIS.

02:00.921 --> 02:02.623
OH, RIGHT.

02:02.656 --> 02:05.426
LET'S JUST IGNORE
THE BIGGEST SOLAR
FLARE IN HISTORY

02:05.459 --> 02:07.127
TO KEEP THE LITTLE
LADY HAPPY.

02:08.596 --> 02:10.431
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE SOLAR FLARE.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.599
I'LL HANDLE IT.

02:11.632 --> 02:12.700
JUST PACK YOUR STUFF
IN THE R.V.

02:12.733 --> 02:15.636
AND GET READY TO GET
YOUR BEACH ON!

02:17.938 --> 02:19.740
I KNOW NOBODY SAYS THAT.
I KNOW THAT.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.579
ADAM, SAFETY GOGGLES AREN'T
GOING TO PROTECT OUR EYES

02:25.613 --> 02:27.415
FROM THE SOLAR FLARE.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.517
NO, BUT IT WILL
PROTECT US FROM THE GLARE

02:29.550 --> 02:33.621
WHEN PASTY-LEGS
DAVENPORT PUTS ON
HIS SHORTS!

02:33.654 --> 02:36.590
Narrator:
 THE WORLD'S FIRST
 BIONIC SUPERHUMANS.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.592
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,

02:38.626 --> 02:40.461
FASTER, SMARTER--

02:40.494 --> 02:42.730
THE NEXT GENERATION
 OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

02:42.763 --> 02:45.599
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?

02:45.633 --> 02:48.736
**

02:54.375 --> 02:55.643
All: AAAAHHH!

03:25.005 --> 03:26.540
ALL RIGHT, TASHA,

03:26.574 --> 03:29.610
YOUR TOTALLY TECH-FREE
WEEKEND STARTS NOW.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.612
GREAT. I'M GONNA
GO CLAIM OUR SPOT.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.247
IF WE WAIT TOO LONG,
WE'RE GONNA END UP

03:33.281 --> 03:34.648
SITTING NEXT TO TALKERS.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.384
I HATE FRIENDLY PEOPLE.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.286
YOU GO AHEAD.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.653
OKAY.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.289
WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.390
WHERE DO YOU GUYS
THINK YOU'RE GOING?

03:42.423 --> 03:43.657
DID YOU FORGET ABOUT
THE SOLAR FLARE?

03:43.691 --> 03:45.259
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT
US TO DO?

03:45.293 --> 03:47.561
BIONICS CAN'T STOP
A SOLAR FLARE.

03:47.595 --> 03:50.831
NO, BUT I HAVE
SOMETHING THAT CAN.

03:52.032 --> 03:54.435
Male Voice:
 IDENTITY AUTHORIZED.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.809
WELCOME TO THE DAVENPORT
INDUSTRIES

04:01.842 --> 04:04.345
MOBILE ACTION LAB.

04:04.378 --> 04:07.014
VERY IMPRESSIVE,
BIG "D."

04:07.047 --> 04:09.817
YOU'RE THE MASTER
OF THE TA-DA MOMENT!

04:09.850 --> 04:12.786
* TA-DA

04:12.820 --> 04:15.022
I CALL HER THE UGLY LADY

04:15.055 --> 04:18.291
BECAUSE IT'S WHAT'S
ON THE INSIDE THAT COUNTS.

04:19.327 --> 04:20.827
YOU GUYS WILL LAUNCH
THE ROCKET JUST LIKE

04:20.861 --> 04:22.062
IN YOUR TRAINING
SIMULATIONS.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.196
IT WILL BLOCK
THE SOLAR FLARE

04:23.230 --> 04:26.767
BY RELEASING A CLOUD OF HEAVY
GAS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.302
COOL!

04:28.336 --> 04:29.837
YOU'RE GOIN'
DOWN, SUN!

04:31.639 --> 04:34.775
THIS SUPERCOMPUTER
IS CALCULATING THE PRECISE TIME

04:34.808 --> 04:36.644
THAT YOU NEED
TO LAUNCH THE ROCKET.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.679
IT COULD BE MINUTES,
IT COULD BE HOURS.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.047
YOU'LL JUST HAVE
TO WAIT AND SEE.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.383
IN HERE?

04:42.416 --> 04:43.851
BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO GO TO THE BEACH.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.686
YEAH, AND I WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE SIX-FEET-ONE.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.855
LIFE IS FULL
OF DISAPPOINTMENTS.

04:50.558 --> 04:51.725
GREAT.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.461
SO WE ALL HAVE
TO PAY THE PRICE

04:53.494 --> 04:56.497
FOR ANOTHER SHORT GUY
WITH AN AXE TO GRIND.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.334
LOOK, GUYS, FOCUS.

05:00.368 --> 05:02.603
IT TAKES ALL THREE OF YOU
TO INITIATE THE SEQUENCE.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.872
ONCE THE ALERT SOUNDS,
YOU'LL HAVE A 2-HOUR WINDOW

05:04.905 --> 05:09.109
TO LAUNCH THE ROCKET
BEFORE THE FLARE BECOMES
UNSTOPPABLE. GOT IT?

05:09.142 --> 05:10.010
YEAH, WE GOT IT.

05:10.043 --> 05:13.381
SAVING THE WORLD'S
GONNA RUIN MY VACATION.

05:13.414 --> 05:14.314
STUPID WORLD!

05:16.384 --> 05:19.119
GUYS, COME ON!
YOU'RE MISSING ALL THE FUN!

05:19.152 --> 05:22.590
THERE IS A BULLDOG
IN SUNGLASSES RIDING
A SURFBOARD!

05:22.623 --> 05:23.857
( violent splash )

05:23.891 --> 05:25.459
OOH! NEVER MIND!

05:26.927 --> 05:28.496
BE RIGHT THERE, HONEY!

05:28.529 --> 05:30.698
LOOK, AS SOON AS YOU GUYS
LAUNCH THE ROCKET

05:30.731 --> 05:32.433
AND SAVE THE WORLD,
YOU CAN GET OUTTA HERE

05:32.466 --> 05:34.502
AND GO GET YOUR BEACH ON.

05:34.535 --> 05:37.371
WHAT, STILL NOTHING?

05:37.405 --> 05:40.340
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T
NEED YOUR APPROVAL.
I'M RICH!

05:42.142 --> 05:46.380
AM I THE ONLY PERSON
WHO THINKS LAUNCHING
A ROCKET IS COOL?

05:46.414 --> 05:49.683
BIG "D," GO SLATHER ON
SOME SPF FIFTY...

05:50.918 --> 05:52.686
THOUSAND.

05:54.422 --> 05:55.589
I GOT THIS.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.391
NO, THE ONLY THING
YOU'VE GOT

05:57.425 --> 05:59.493
IS THE UNCANNY
ABILITY TO BREAK

05:59.527 --> 06:02.496
THE MOST EXPENSIVE
THING IN THE ROOM.

06:04.498 --> 06:07.601
IS THIS ABOUT YOUR GUITAR?

06:07.635 --> 06:09.603
WHAT ABOUT MY GUITAR?

06:09.637 --> 06:11.939
LET'S GO! WE'RE MISSING
THE SURFING BULLDOG!

06:11.972 --> 06:14.708
WHAT ABOUT MY GUITAR?

06:18.779 --> 06:20.814
AH, LISTEN TO THAT--

06:20.848 --> 06:24.685
NO PHONES RINGING,
NO GADGETS BUZZING.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.820
JUST THE SOUNDS
OF NATURE AND...

06:26.854 --> 06:30.958
A BULLDOG BARKING UP
( doSEAWEED.g )

06:30.991 --> 06:34.595
YEP. THERE'S NOTHING
MORE FUN THAN SITTING
COMPLETELY STILL

06:34.628 --> 06:37.431
IN DIRECT SUNLIGHT
FOR HOURS ON END.

06:37.465 --> 06:41.001
MY BACK SWEAT IS HEADED
TOWARDS UNNATURAL PLACES.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.006
LEO, COME HERE.

06:48.542 --> 06:51.779
I STILL HAVE TO SECRETLY
SUPERVISE THE MISSION
FROM HERE,

06:51.812 --> 06:53.514
SO HOW WOULD YOU
LIKE TO BE

06:53.547 --> 06:57.485
MY COVERT COMMUNICATIONS
LIAISON?

06:57.518 --> 07:00.454
IS THIS LIKE THE TIME
YOU TRICKED ME INTO
DOING THE DISHES

07:00.488 --> 07:04.458
BY CALLING ME YOUR
CULINARY IMPLEMENT
DECONTAMINATOR?

07:04.492 --> 07:07.227
YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.562
OBSERVE.

07:09.697 --> 07:13.801
WELL, LEO,
YOU LOOK, UH, PARCHED.

07:13.834 --> 07:16.804
LET ME GET YOU
A FROSTY BEVERAGE.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.909
DRINK UP.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.046
( dialing )

07:27.247 --> 07:30.884
IT'S A SECRET CAN-PHONE!

07:30.918 --> 07:32.219
( ringing )

07:32.252 --> 07:34.555
THERE IS NO SUCH THING
AS A TECH-FREE WEEKEND.

07:34.588 --> 07:37.691
( telephone ringing )

07:37.725 --> 07:40.260
SUPER-BORING MISSION
 HEADQUARTERS.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.461
BREE SPEAKING.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.866
HEY, BREE.
HOW'S THE MISSION?

07:45.899 --> 07:47.568
LEO, WHAT ARE YOU DRINKING?

07:48.636 --> 07:51.505
CALL-YOU-BACK COLA.

07:51.539 --> 07:52.740
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO DRINK SODA.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.608
IT MAKES YOU ALL JUMPY.
GIVE ME THAT.

07:56.276 --> 07:57.477
NOW!

08:02.049 --> 08:04.752
( crackling and whirring )

08:07.588 --> 08:10.524
I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE SPRUNG
FOR THE WHOLE SIX-PACK.

08:10.558 --> 08:12.560
WELL, I'M SORRY,
BIG "D."

08:12.593 --> 08:15.629
LOOKS LIKE I'M GONNA
HAVE TO CHECK IN WITH 'EM
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY--

08:15.663 --> 08:18.498
WITH MY FEET, MY FACE,
AND A WHOLE LOT OF THIS.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.571
YEAH. JUST
HURRY BACK, WILL YA?

08:23.604 --> 08:25.573
THE ONLY REASON
I'M LETTING YOU GO
IN THE FIRST PLACE

08:25.606 --> 08:28.609
IS YOU STOPPED DOING
THAT ANYWHERE NEAR ME.

08:37.985 --> 08:40.821
HEY, SUPER SIBS.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.691
HOW'S THE MISSION GOING?

08:43.724 --> 08:45.659
THIS STINKS!

08:45.693 --> 08:47.861
WE'RE GONNA WASTE
THE WHOLE STUPID DAY
IN THIS STUPID LAB

08:47.895 --> 08:49.863
WAITING FOR THIS
STUPID COMPUTER.

08:49.897 --> 08:52.566
IT'S ALL JUST SO...
DUMB!

08:52.600 --> 08:56.837
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE TURNS COMING
TO THE BEACH WITH ME?

08:56.870 --> 09:00.340
WE CAN'T. THE LAUNCH PROCEDURE
REQUIRES ALL THREE OF US.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.711
MMM, BUT IF THERE ARE
THREE OF US PLUS ONE,

09:03.744 --> 09:06.680
THEN TWO CAN STAY
AND TWO CAN GO UNTIL
WE NEED THREE,

09:06.714 --> 09:08.348
AND THEN ONE CAN STAY
AND ONE CAN RUN AND GET

09:08.381 --> 09:11.351
THE ONE WHO'S HAVING
FUN WITH THE OTHER ONE.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.120
WAIT. SOMEBODY
CHECK MY MATH.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.589
HE'S RIGHT.

09:15.623 --> 09:19.026
SOMEONE PAT HIM
ON THE HEAD AND
GIVE HIM A BISCUIT.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.094
COOL, SO ONE OF US
CAN LEAVE.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.796
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD
PUT IT UP TO A...

09:22.830 --> 09:24.331
ME FIRST!
COME ON, LEO!

09:24.364 --> 09:26.066
( Leo cries out )

09:26.099 --> 09:27.901
...VOTE!

09:29.637 --> 09:32.606
HEY, SUPER SPEED
DOES NOT OVERRULE
DEMOCRACY!

09:36.944 --> 09:38.879
THESO GONE!E!

09:38.912 --> 09:41.114
THISO NOT FAIR!R!

09:41.148 --> 09:43.016
SHE IS NOT GONNA
GET AWAY WITH THIS!

09:43.050 --> 09:44.918
SO NOT GONNA GET
AWAY WITH THIS!

09:46.987 --> 09:48.155
YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:48.188 --> 09:50.624
I'M GONNA MARCH
RIGHT DOWN TO THAT BEACH

09:50.658 --> 09:53.661
AND I'M GONNA FIND HER,
EVEN IF IT TAKES ME
ALL DAY.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.729
YEAH! YOU GO WITH
YOUR BAD SELF!

09:55.763 --> 09:57.831
MAKE HER PAY!

10:01.001 --> 10:03.070
WAIT, DID HE JUST DO
WHAT I THINK HE DID?

10:03.103 --> 10:05.105
OHH, HE DID!

10:05.138 --> 10:07.841
HE WENT TO THE BEACH
WITHOUT HIS SUN HAT!

10:07.875 --> 10:09.910
CHASE, YOU'RE GONNA GET
A SUNBURN!

10:12.145 --> 10:14.748
LAUNCH WINDOW OPEN.

10:14.782 --> 10:17.685
( Klaxon blares )

10:33.433 --> 10:35.102
CHASE, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

10:35.135 --> 10:37.070
WATCHING THIS GUY.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.706
PEOPLE KEEP
GIVING HIM MONEY,

10:38.739 --> 10:40.908
BUT HE JUST WON'T LEAVE.

10:40.941 --> 10:44.111
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
WATCHING THE MOBILE LAB.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.446
NO WORRIES.
ADAM'S WATCHING IT.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.716
WHAT'S UP, BEACH BUMS?

10:51.051 --> 10:52.452
ADAM, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

10:52.485 --> 10:54.221
WELL, I WANTED
AN ICE CREAM CONE,

10:54.254 --> 10:56.089
BUT THEY HAD 21 FLAVORS.

10:56.123 --> 10:59.727
AND YOU KNOW ME--
I'M NEVER ONE TO MAKE
AN UNINFORMED DECISION.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.461
ADAM, GET RID OF THOSE.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.230
WE NEED TO GET BACK
TO THE MOBILE LAB.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.665
OH, RIGHT.
FREE ICE CREAM!

11:07.935 --> 11:09.937
OH, AND DON'T WORRY,
IT'S BARELY LICKED.

11:15.008 --> 11:18.078
WHERE'S THE MOBILE LAB?
IT WAS PARKED RIGHT HERE.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.246
IT'S GONE!

11:19.279 --> 11:22.716
OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
NOBODY PANIC.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.684

11:26.486 --> 11:29.056
SORRY. BRAIN FREEZE.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.125
WHERE'S THE R.V.?

11:40.300 --> 11:43.136
HOW COULD THE MOBILE LAB
JUST DISAPPEAR?

11:43.170 --> 11:46.006
MAYBE IT GOT TIRED OF WAITING
AND IT SPLIT LIKE WE DID.

11:48.942 --> 11:51.144
WE HAVE TO TELL
MR. DAVENPORT.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.946
OH, YEAH?
AND WHAT ARE WE
GONNA TELL HIM?

11:52.980 --> 11:54.982
"HEY, REMEMBER THAT
REALLY EASY MISSION

11:55.015 --> 11:56.950
"WHERE ALL WE HAD TO DO
WAS SIT AROUND AND WAIT?

11:56.984 --> 11:58.919
"WELL, GUESS WHAT--
WE TOTALLY BLEW IT,

11:58.952 --> 12:01.021
AND THE WORLD IS TOAST.
OOPSIE!"

12:01.054 --> 12:04.057
FREEZE! squawks )

12:07.828 --> 12:09.763
OFFICER, WE'D LIKE
TO REPORT A CRIME.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.531
SOMEONE STOLE OUR R.V.
FROM THIS SPOT,

12:11.564 --> 12:13.233
AND IT'S SUPERCRITICAL
THAT WE GET--

12:13.266 --> 12:16.269
COOL YOUR JETS, SPANKY.

12:16.303 --> 12:18.005
I HAD IT TOWED.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.773
WHAT? WHY?

12:19.807 --> 12:22.910
YOUR CAR ALARM'S
BEEN GOIN' OFF FOR,
LIKE, AN HOUR, DUDE.

12:22.943 --> 12:26.013
PLUS, I THOUGHT IT'D
BE FUNNY TO WATCH
A LITTLE TOW TRUCK

12:26.046 --> 12:27.915
PULL THAT HUGE THING AWAY.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.883
IT WAS.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.020
CAR ALARM?

12:33.053 --> 12:35.022
IF YOU WANT YOUR
R.V. BACK,

12:35.055 --> 12:37.791
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
COUGH UP 200 CLAMS.

12:37.825 --> 12:38.992
OKAY.

12:39.026 --> 12:40.794
BUT DOES IT HAVE
TO BE CLAMS?

12:40.828 --> 12:43.030
'CAUSE, PERSONALLY,
I'M MORE OF A SHRIMP GUY.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.137
( sYOU GUYS...s )

12:50.170 --> 12:51.905
THAT "CAR ALARM"
WAS THE ALERT TONE

12:51.939 --> 12:53.807
TELLING US TO LAUNCH
THE ROCKET!

12:53.841 --> 12:56.076
WAIT. SO THAT MEANS
WE HAVE UNDER AN HOUR

12:56.109 --> 12:58.345
TO COLLECT $200,
GET THE MOBILE LAB BACK,

12:58.378 --> 13:01.114
STOP THE SOLAR FLARE,

WE NEED TO TELL
MR. DAVENPORT.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.992
HE'LL GIVE US THE MONEY
TO GET THE R.V. BACK.

13:12.025 --> 13:14.828
NO. NO WAY.
WE CAN STILL FIX THIS.

13:14.862 --> 13:17.965
COME ON, I KNOW HOW
WE CAN GET THE MONEY FAST.

13:17.998 --> 13:20.033
CHASE, GET BACK HERE.

13:20.067 --> 13:23.603

WOW, DONALD, I'M IMPRESSED.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.108

HER FLYING FINGERS
ARE QUICKER THAN
THE HUMAN EYE,

15:34.734 --> 15:37.170
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY
A SIMPLE TRICK THAT'S
NOT THAT IMPRESSIVE

15:37.204 --> 15:39.139
ONCE YOU KNOW HOW IT'S DONE.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.241
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST,

15:41.274 --> 15:44.744
LET'S KEEP IT GOING
FOR THE AMAZING CHASE,

15:44.777 --> 15:47.080
WHO WILL...

15:49.416 --> 15:52.385
WHAT CAN YOU DO
THAT WON'T BORE PEOPLE?

15:52.419 --> 15:54.421
I GOT THIS.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.490

COULD KINDLY GIVE ME

15:57.524 --> 16:00.260
A PRIME NUMBER

HE'S WEARING FLIP-FLOPS,

16:36.529 --> 16:38.598
AND HIS SQUAD CAR
HAS HANDLEBARS.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.235
HE'S NOT EVEN A REAL COP.

16:44.604 --> 16:47.006
YET HE HAS A REAL JAIL.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.778
OKAY, THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
LEFT FOR US TO DO--

16:51.811 --> 16:55.515
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY

MR. DAVENPORT FAST.

16:55.548 --> 16:58.185
UH, I'LL JUST CALL HIM.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.220

I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT WORKED!

17:05.325 --> 17:07.527
I DID NOT STEAL ANYTHING.

THE MYSTERY.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.354
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

17:34.387 --> 17:36.223
I CAN USE MY STRENGTH

A WAY TO DISTRACT

17:39.292 --> 17:41.060
