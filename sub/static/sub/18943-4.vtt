00:02.999 --> 00:04.678
Blue-veined piccolo.

00:04.679 --> 00:07.478
- Pork sword.
- Pink trombone.

00:07.479 --> 00:10.479
- Mr Happy Helmet.
- Is that one?

00:11.199 --> 00:14.199
- Definitely.
- Ten seconds.

00:14.279 --> 00:17.879
- There can't be any more.
- Five, four, three, two, one. Out.

00:17.879 --> 00:20.199
- There aren't any more!
- Bone phone,

00:20.199 --> 00:22.799
- spam javelin, ham howitzer...
- Fuck.

00:22.799 --> 00:24.959
..mutton musket, the bald friar.

00:24.959 --> 00:27.798
You are fucking impressive.

00:27.799 --> 00:30.799
OK, my choice now. How about...

00:31.639 --> 00:34.198
- gay euphemisms?
- My round.

00:34.199 --> 00:36.920
- Not for me, I've got to go.
- Lightweight.

00:36.920 --> 00:39.920
Some of us have to focus on the future.

00:40.920 --> 00:44.399
Clare's roped me in
to help organise Careers Week.

00:44.399 --> 00:46.358
- Night, then.
- Poofter.

00:46.359 --> 00:48.078
- Fag.
- Shirt-lifter.

00:48.079 --> 00:50.240
- Beachcomber.
- Sausage smuggler.

00:50.240 --> 00:52.798
- Fudge packer.
- Marmite miner.

00:52.799 --> 00:55.879
- Erm...
- Five, four, three, two, one. Out.

00:56.799 --> 00:58.299
Oh, I had a good one.

00:58.920 --> 01:02.039
- Mm, it's gone.
- Five, four, three, two, one.

01:02.039 --> 01:03.879
Me and the champ. Turd burglar.

01:03.879 --> 01:06.879
- Chocolate chimney sweep.
- Tail gunner.

01:08.400 --> 01:11.400
Five, four, three, two, one. Yes!

01:11.960 --> 01:15.740
Finally, the PE/Geography
teacher chalks up a victory!

01:16.439 --> 01:20.919
But he has the grace and dignity
to shake the hand of the loser.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.118
He's great, isn't he?

01:29.119 --> 01:32.640
(Kurt) I'm sure he'll let you
hold it if you ask nicely.

01:32.640 --> 01:34.390
I just mean he's a laugh.

01:35.159 --> 01:37.440
Don't jump off any cliffs tonight

01:37.440 --> 01:41.239
unless you want the northern retard
following you over.

01:41.239 --> 01:43.278
Who wants a backie?

01:43.279 --> 01:46.239
- After you, mate.
- You're all right.

01:46.240 --> 01:49.160
- Go on. You know you want to.
- No. I'm fine.

01:49.160 --> 01:53.150
I didn't wanna start an argument.
I'll walk with you, eh?

01:56.519 --> 02:00.959
OK, forget the music, who would
you shag - Christina or Britney?

02:00.959 --> 02:04.879
- Britney, definitely.
- Christina for me, body and soul.

02:04.879 --> 02:07.879
You think she'd want either?

02:08.720 --> 02:12.290
You blew Simon out of the water
in that cock round.

02:12.479 --> 02:16.119
- Bit of a specialist subject.
- He was totally gutted.

02:16.119 --> 02:17.919
You took it in the gay round.

02:17.919 --> 02:21.349
Used to work in a factory
during school holidays.

02:21.360 --> 02:24.800
You can't expect me to know
all the slang for being gay.

02:24.800 --> 02:28.230
It's more the preserve
of you non-gay people, eh?

02:30.199 --> 02:33.199
(Wind whistles)

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
(â™ª Snowblind: Fistful Of Dollars)

03:16.760 --> 03:19.239
- (Boys cheer)
- (Horn honks)

03:19.240 --> 03:21.759
(Simon) JP's gay?
(Kurt) Completely.

03:21.759 --> 03:24.920
That explains why everyone's
so at ease with him.

03:24.920 --> 03:27.199
Women. He poses no sexual threat.

03:27.199 --> 03:29.920
You don't have to be gay
to get on with women.

03:29.920 --> 03:32.280
- It helps!
- I always knew he was.

03:32.280 --> 03:35.280
- No, you didn't.
- I did, though.

03:36.320 --> 03:38.359
You knew?

03:38.360 --> 03:41.319
- Ages ago.
- And you didn't tell us?

03:41.320 --> 03:43.119
I thought it was obvious.

03:43.120 --> 03:46.279
You were the one trying
to get into his trousers.

03:46.279 --> 03:49.239
- I was in a vulnerable place.
- Bosnia?

03:49.240 --> 03:50.919
Ha, ha.

03:50.920 --> 03:55.120
Yeah, well, we all bark up the wrong tree
from time to time.

03:55.320 --> 03:58.320
I thought you two were gay at first.

03:59.079 --> 04:01.198
- Who?
- You and Brian.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.838
Why?

04:02.839 --> 04:06.619
Two single blokes living together,
PE and IT teachers.

04:06.839 --> 04:08.719
What's that got to do with it?

04:08.719 --> 04:11.759
A sporty one and a geek -
a classic combination.

04:11.759 --> 04:13.279
- Fuck!
- What?

04:13.280 --> 04:15.639
- It's falling into place.
- What is?

04:15.639 --> 04:19.279
That's why he moved in,
why you wanted me out and JP in.

04:19.279 --> 04:22.430
- Why?
- Because you wanted to check him out.

04:23.920 --> 04:26.399
Taste the alternative lifestyle.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.239
- Fuck off!
- (Kurt) Bollocks!

04:28.239 --> 04:30.680
It's almost worth
living with my dad again

04:30.680 --> 04:34.460
to know you're getting
a chance to express yourselves.

04:34.880 --> 04:37.839
And that JP's there as your role model.

04:37.840 --> 04:39.838
Mornin'.

04:39.839 --> 04:42.678
- (All grunt)
- Everything all right?

04:42.679 --> 04:45.679
I think it's fantastic - that you're gay.

04:48.399 --> 04:52.739
I knew if I told Brian and Kurt
it'd save putting a notice up.

04:55.120 --> 04:58.690
The next few days are our
Focus On The Future days.

04:59.120 --> 05:02.340
Jenny here's in charge.
Have tutors got packs?

05:03.320 --> 05:05.919
If they look in their pigeonholes.

05:05.920 --> 05:09.920
(Clare) This is about giving students
guidance and support

05:09.920 --> 05:13.350
and making the right decisions
for their futures.

05:13.480 --> 05:17.240
So don't snigger
when they tell you what they want to be.

05:17.240 --> 05:20.250
Kurt will have KUDOS
running shortly, yeah?

05:20.319 --> 05:24.169
Familiarise yourself with
the software before using it.

05:24.400 --> 05:27.480
We'll practise interview
techniques tomorrow

05:27.640 --> 05:30.000
and the careers fair is on Thursday.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.080
Let's approach this
with enthusiasm, please!

05:33.399 --> 05:35.840
Any problems, pester Jenny, not me.

05:35.840 --> 05:40.110
Your cooperation will be very welcome
over the next few days.

05:44.440 --> 05:46.718
I can't be gay, I shagged Jenny.

05:46.719 --> 05:48.920
A one-night stand doesn't count.

05:48.920 --> 05:50.999
Carol and I had loads of sex!

05:51.000 --> 05:53.599
Do you mind? I'm still eating!

05:53.600 --> 05:56.890
Oh, by the way,
I've changed my mind about you.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
What about me?

06:03.599 --> 06:07.839
People will think we asked JP to stay
because we wanted him to.

06:07.839 --> 06:09.558
We did.

06:09.559 --> 06:11.558
I mean "wanted" him to stay.

06:11.559 --> 06:13.598
- I blame you.
- Why?

06:13.599 --> 06:16.599
- You always brown-nose him.
- Bollocks!

06:16.719 --> 06:19.920
"You blew Simon out of
the water in the cock round."

06:19.920 --> 06:23.630
- Course he fucking did!
- He said he'd shag Britney.

06:23.720 --> 06:27.220
Given a choice between
her and Christina Aguilera.

06:27.519 --> 06:31.760
If you'd thrown Ricky Martin in,
you'd have got a different response.

06:31.760 --> 06:35.479
Every female that comes to work here's
gonna think like Penny.

06:35.479 --> 06:38.629
- Are they?
- It's hard enough getting women.

06:40.159 --> 06:43.659
He was only supposed to stay
on a temporary basis.

06:44.760 --> 06:46.758
- So?
- So sound him out.

06:46.759 --> 06:50.799
- Ask if he's looking for somewhere else.
- I can't. Why do I have to do it?

06:50.799 --> 06:53.179
Penny's changed her mind about me.

07:07.679 --> 07:10.679
I just wanted to say sorry about...

07:13.799 --> 07:17.159
telling people that you were - are -
you know...

07:17.719 --> 07:19.879
- Gay?
- Gay, yeah.

07:19.880 --> 07:22.880
- Forget about it.
- It'll go no further.

07:23.159 --> 07:24.798
Why?

07:24.799 --> 07:27.438
Cos it could be embarrassing.

07:27.439 --> 07:29.640
- Is it a problem for you?
- Me?

07:29.640 --> 07:33.440
Cos loads of people turn into tossers
when they find out.

07:33.440 --> 07:36.440
- Really?
- Like I'll want to jump on 'em.

07:36.760 --> 07:40.750
They should be so lucky, eh?
I mean, I know you wouldn't.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.879
Not with me. Or anyone.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.879
- Nothing's changed.
- Right.

07:45.880 --> 07:48.119
Except that now you know I'm gay.

07:48.119 --> 07:51.919
And we're glad we know you...
I mean, I'm glad you're...

07:51.919 --> 07:54.399
who you are and... happy.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.959
- And all that.
- I knew you'd be OK with it.

07:56.959 --> 07:59.959
Of course I am, mate. No problem.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.600
See you... at home.

08:07.839 --> 08:10.638
(Children yelling)

08:10.639 --> 08:12.719
"Course I am, mate. No problem.

08:12.719 --> 08:15.719
- "I love you, JP."
- Fuck off.

08:16.519 --> 08:19.039
Curtis, who am I?

08:19.040 --> 08:22.120
I have no problem
with dealing with numbers,

08:22.719 --> 08:25.719
figures, charts, organisational skills.

08:26.200 --> 08:29.200
I like maths, statistics, numeracy.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.720
The job families I'm interested in

08:33.720 --> 08:37.640
are working with figures,
solving mathematical problems.

08:37.720 --> 08:39.919
(Sighs) My career choice -

08:39.919 --> 08:42.919
anything to do with managing... money.

08:46.039 --> 08:47.839
Jesus.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.799
My dad's a bank manager.

08:49.800 --> 08:51.840
And you wanna be like your dad?

08:51.840 --> 08:54.840
- Why not?
- Because he's your dad!

08:56.799 --> 09:00.439
Work in insurance... civil service...
local council?

09:00.720 --> 09:02.759
What is wrong with you lot?

09:02.760 --> 09:04.519
They're all good jobs.

09:04.520 --> 09:08.930
Yeah, but does no one wanna write
a novel, make a film, travel?

09:09.919 --> 09:14.679
- You can do whatever you want!
- I really want to work in accounts.

09:16.119 --> 09:19.119
(Typing)

09:20.559 --> 09:22.519
- When's it my turn?
- Wait!

09:30.960 --> 09:34.110
Jobs best suited for you
according to KUDOS -

09:34.720 --> 09:37.720
are tree surgery or forestry.

09:38.640 --> 09:42.280
I knew it, I should have
followed my boyhood dreams.

09:42.359 --> 09:45.359
Fuck it.

09:49.239 --> 09:52.239
Put in your name. It's B-R-I-A...

09:53.919 --> 09:56.399
Follow the questionnaire.

09:56.400 --> 09:59.239
"Do you watch
factual programmes on TV?"

09:59.240 --> 10:02.118
Have they not got porn down there?

10:02.119 --> 10:03.400
Does it work?

10:03.400 --> 10:07.180
Liz came out as an officer
in a correctional facility.

10:11.479 --> 10:14.559
- Has he said anything to you?
- What about?

10:14.799 --> 10:18.159
You blabbing his personal life
round the school.

10:18.160 --> 10:21.080
- He seems pretty cool about it.
- And you?

10:21.080 --> 10:24.080
- What about me?
- Are you "cool" with it?

10:25.039 --> 10:26.539
Me? Of course!

10:30.199 --> 10:35.599
It's Brian who's taken it like an insult.
Keeps on about getting JP out of the flat.

10:35.599 --> 10:38.359
- Why?
- That's what I said. "Why?"

10:38.360 --> 10:42.479
You know Brian, he's worried
it might reflect on him in some way.

10:42.479 --> 10:45.909
- And you're not?
- I don't chase after JP, do I?

10:46.599 --> 10:49.279
Aw!

10:49.280 --> 10:52.238
It's quite funny though, isn't it?

10:52.239 --> 10:55.239
I suppose it is.

10:56.520 --> 10:59.520
Let's see, come on.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.879
What's it say?

11:07.880 --> 11:10.398
Hairdresser or flight attendant.

11:10.399 --> 11:12.198
It's very perceptive.

11:12.199 --> 11:15.199
- Let's have a look.
- Oh, gone. Sorry.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.239
Here it is in black and white.

11:19.239 --> 11:22.239
You can't fight it, Brian.

11:24.959 --> 11:26.960
How come Kurt's off the hook?

11:26.960 --> 11:29.840
Going out with Carol should've made
him more suspect.

11:29.840 --> 11:31.800
He looks far more gay than me.

11:31.800 --> 11:36.560
Maybe you don't question yourself
because you come over so straight.

11:36.679 --> 11:40.179
- Not because I am straight?
- Only you know that.

11:40.280 --> 11:44.239
- The computer never lies.
- One more word and I'll belt you.

11:44.239 --> 11:46.840
No need to get
all aggressive and macho.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.840
It proves nothing.

11:51.560 --> 11:54.960
Be honest, have you ever
looked at me and thought,

11:54.960 --> 11:57.198
"There goes a gay man"?

11:57.199 --> 12:00.640
I never make assumptions
about people's sexuality.

12:00.640 --> 12:02.839
I'm obsessed with Penny's tits!

12:02.840 --> 12:06.960
Which are big, false, plastic ones.
How much gayer can you get?

12:06.960 --> 12:10.760
Do you think people will think
I invited JP into the flat

12:10.760 --> 12:14.640
for some other reason
than that he wanted a place to stay?

12:14.640 --> 12:16.719
- Did you?
- No.

12:16.720 --> 12:18.598
Are you sure?

12:18.599 --> 12:21.160
It was before I knew he was gay,
for fuck's sake.

12:21.160 --> 12:25.710
Maybe it was because subconsciously
you already knew that he was.

12:37.759 --> 12:41.560
I know you've got your heart
set on beauty therapy, Gail,

12:41.560 --> 12:45.060
but you'll never be
stuck for work as a plasterer.

12:47.640 --> 12:51.560
How does aircraft maintenance
engineering sound, Graham?

12:52.880 --> 12:55.890
Well, you've fallen a little short of that.

12:55.920 --> 12:58.920
Top of the list - shop fitter.

12:59.919 --> 13:03.559
I knew one of you
had to have a spark of creativity.

13:03.919 --> 13:06.919
Best option -
performance-orientated work.

13:07.840 --> 13:10.840
Actor, dancer, musician.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.798
Curtis. You see, deep down

13:16.799 --> 13:20.880
I knew there was a creative artist
screaming to be let out.

13:20.880 --> 13:23.560
I did fancy the Young People's Theatre.

13:23.560 --> 13:27.359
Fantastic! Why not try it this year?
What have you got to lose?

13:27.359 --> 13:29.719
They don't need more admin staff.

13:29.720 --> 13:31.758
(Bell)

13:31.759 --> 13:34.238
JP! You're the man to help us.

13:34.239 --> 13:37.249
Where are the local
pick-up joints for men?

13:37.840 --> 13:39.678
You mean for gay men?

13:39.679 --> 13:43.179
- We're just... interested.
- More mildly curious.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.358
For research purposes.

13:45.359 --> 13:47.358
Mildly curious research?

13:47.359 --> 13:50.479
We've got a friend
and he's having a tough time

13:50.479 --> 13:53.979
coming to terms with
certain things about himself.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.039
- He might be bent?
- Exactly.

13:56.039 --> 13:59.119
So the least we can do
is find out about the local gay scene.

13:59.119 --> 14:01.080
Pick up some leaflets for him.

14:01.080 --> 14:04.370
It's not an easy time.
He needs our... support.

14:05.599 --> 14:07.959
Yeah. As a matter of interest,

14:07.960 --> 14:11.400
can you automatically tell
who's gay and who isn't?

14:11.400 --> 14:15.320
Well, no, but if I look very deep
into someone's eyes...

14:15.880 --> 14:18.599
Really?

14:18.600 --> 14:20.080
Susan!

14:20.080 --> 14:23.119
- It isn't you, is it?
- No, it fucking isn't!

14:23.119 --> 14:25.639
I'm 100% heterosexual, thank you.

14:25.640 --> 14:28.640
No one's 100% heterosexual.

14:31.039 --> 14:33.439
- I'm not a poof.
- You're not gay.

14:33.439 --> 14:36.398
- I know.
- The word is gay, not poof.

14:36.399 --> 14:38.799
All right, I'm not fucking gay.

14:38.800 --> 14:41.079
- Why are you so scared?
- I'm not.

14:41.079 --> 14:43.279
- Are you scared of JP?
- No.

14:43.280 --> 14:46.038
- You like him?
- He's all right, yeah.

14:46.039 --> 14:50.120
Of course, it could be that
it's only JP you're attracted to,

14:50.120 --> 14:51.998
not the whole gay thing.

14:51.999 --> 14:55.440
No one to admire, along comes
someone new and dynamic...

14:55.440 --> 14:58.870
- I do not fancy JP.
- People get crushes, Brian,

14:59.639 --> 15:03.279
there's no law restricting them
to the opposite sex.

15:03.320 --> 15:06.679
You must have had crushes
on blokes before, or idols?

15:06.679 --> 15:08.119
No.

15:08.119 --> 15:12.249
No admiration thing that tipped over
into something deeper?

15:12.639 --> 15:15.089
Hm, maybe Bryan Robson at his peak.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.038
There you go, then.

15:18.039 --> 15:20.160
I didn't want to sleep with him!

15:20.160 --> 15:23.160
Some things go deeper than sex, Brian.

15:34.160 --> 15:36.038
How is he?

15:36.039 --> 15:39.039
He's confused. Worried. Concerned.

15:40.919 --> 15:43.919
Just where we want him.

15:44.359 --> 15:47.369
You don't think we should... lay off a bit?

15:50.400 --> 15:53.400
(Both) Nah!

16:07.600 --> 16:10.600
How you doing?

16:11.679 --> 16:14.679
All right.

16:33.119 --> 16:35.118
I've got to, er...

16:35.119 --> 16:38.119
What about your dinner?

16:41.919 --> 16:43.759
(Sighs)

16:43.760 --> 16:46.760
Well, if he's not hungry.

16:54.599 --> 16:57.259
- We're eating.
- Great! I'm starving.

17:02.439 --> 17:04.358
Let me get this straight,

17:04.359 --> 17:08.280
people tell you you might be gay
and you just accept it.

17:08.559 --> 17:10.039
Well...

17:10.039 --> 17:13.240
If I told you you were a mechanic,
would you fix my car?

17:13.240 --> 17:16.240
I'd probably have a go, yeah.

17:17.638 --> 17:20.638
Have you had confused feelings before?

17:22.240 --> 17:25.119
- I like women.
- There you go. Case solved.

17:25.119 --> 17:28.119
Gay men like women too.

17:29.799 --> 17:33.279
I know you said one-night stands
don't count but...

17:33.279 --> 17:37.059
I mean, me and Jenny shagged
and there was no problem.

17:37.079 --> 17:39.758
I mean, it was pretty good.

17:39.759 --> 17:43.120
He didn't ask you to indulge
in any fantasy situations?

17:43.120 --> 17:46.839
Paste-on moustache,
touch your toes and think of England?

17:46.839 --> 17:50.269
We shagged and a gay man
wouldn't have done that.

17:50.319 --> 17:53.319
You slept with him?

17:57.360 --> 18:00.360
- Morning.
- Mornin'.

18:02.519 --> 18:04.599
Did you get it sorted?

18:04.600 --> 18:06.238
What?

18:06.239 --> 18:08.798
You went round to see Susan, yeah?

18:08.799 --> 18:10.599
How do you know?

18:10.600 --> 18:12.558
Oh, lucky guess.

18:12.559 --> 18:15.558
Come to any conclusions?

18:15.559 --> 18:18.559
I'll be in the car.

18:26.680 --> 18:29.038
(Radio static)

18:29.039 --> 18:31.359
(â™ª Gloria Gaynor: I Am What I Am)

18:31.360 --> 18:34.360
Yes!

18:36.119 --> 18:38.838
â™ª I am what I am

18:38.839 --> 18:41.839
â™ª I don't want praise
I don't want pity

18:43.799 --> 18:46.158
â™ª I bang my own drum

18:46.159 --> 18:49.239
â™ª Some think it's noise,
I think it's pretty

18:50.320 --> 18:53.890
â™ª And so what if I love
each bauble and each bangle

18:55.319 --> 18:58.889
â™ª Why not try to see things
from a different angle?

18:59.080 --> 19:01.198
â™ª Your life is a sham

19:01.199 --> 19:04.349
â™ª Till you can shout out,
"I am what I am!" â™ª

19:07.360 --> 19:09.038
How's he doing?

19:09.039 --> 19:11.319
Still on the endangered species list.

19:11.319 --> 19:15.029
- Uncertain man.
- Found on Could-Be-A-Poof Mountain.

19:17.439 --> 19:19.439
Thanks for last night.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.800
Alec really needed to know about us.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.638
It just came out. Sorry.

19:23.639 --> 19:27.979
Next time you're worried
about something, keep it to yourself.

19:31.880 --> 19:35.800
There's something quite boyish
about Jenny, isn't there?

19:38.040 --> 19:40.798
Hang on, you slept with her too.

19:40.799 --> 19:44.509
Just out of interest,
which of these does it for you?

19:46.480 --> 19:49.240
How about this one -
he's more your type.

19:49.240 --> 19:51.359
He's not unlike JP, actually.

19:51.360 --> 19:52.999
Where?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.879
Have you not got anything better to do?

19:55.880 --> 19:58.239
- Let me think. No.
- No, no.

19:58.240 --> 20:01.600
- If none of these appeal, we...
- Will you fuck off?

20:01.600 --> 20:04.039
We're only trying to help.

20:04.040 --> 20:08.450
Coming to terms with a whole new
sexual identity can't be easy.

20:10.359 --> 20:13.359
(Liz) Any problems?

20:15.279 --> 20:17.599
- No.
- As school secretary,

20:17.600 --> 20:20.800
I like to stay ahead of the game,
spot any crises.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.959
Don't worry, we're on top of it.

20:22.959 --> 20:27.369
The boss wants you to stay away
from the guest buffet tomorrow.

20:27.559 --> 20:31.000
It's limited to senior staff,
organisers and guests.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.840
What about hard-working
members of staff?

20:33.840 --> 20:36.518
Bring sandwiches.

20:36.519 --> 20:38.798
You keep this to have a look at.

20:38.799 --> 20:41.638
Or put on your, er, locker door.

20:41.639 --> 20:45.909
Show us your favourites later.
The JP lookalike's on page 22.

21:05.039 --> 21:08.049
Blokes in thongs don't really do it for me.

21:09.360 --> 21:12.360
Or me.

21:23.360 --> 21:25.639
- Sir, do we have your lesson next?
- Oui.

21:25.639 --> 21:28.279
- When's our assignment due?
- Vendredi.

21:28.279 --> 21:31.289
- (Girl) Any chance of an extension?
- Non!

21:43.519 --> 21:45.558
I'll be five minutes.

21:45.559 --> 21:48.569
It's just that
recently I've been having...

21:49.679 --> 21:51.719
doubts about some stuff.

21:51.720 --> 21:54.720
Can you be more specific?

21:55.120 --> 21:57.559
Do you think it's possible...

21:57.560 --> 22:01.550
I mean, could somebody
spend most of their lives being...

22:02.600 --> 22:05.610
what they are
and suddenly one day think...

22:05.840 --> 22:08.840
maybe I'm not this thing at all?

22:14.159 --> 22:16.799
Has this got something to do
with Simon and Kurt?

22:16.799 --> 22:19.879
- What about them?
- Their friend in crisis.

22:20.399 --> 22:23.129
Are you trying to say
you might be gay?

22:25.639 --> 22:28.639
I...

22:29.199 --> 22:32.199
I'm not sure how I can help.

22:36.479 --> 22:38.159
- You just have.
- When?

22:39.840 --> 22:42.718
- He can't throw.
- Who can't?

22:42.719 --> 22:44.798
- JP.
- So?

22:44.799 --> 22:47.518
I can't fancy someone
who can't throw.

22:47.519 --> 22:50.720
So you fuckers find someone else
to rip the piss out of.

22:50.720 --> 22:54.480
You accepted a multitude
of flaws in your girlfriends.

22:54.480 --> 22:57.679
Some of them had
few redeeming features at all.

22:57.679 --> 22:59.880
Maybe you're more picky with men.

22:59.880 --> 23:02.880
- Of course.
- What?

23:03.320 --> 23:05.439
Did you fancy every woman you saw?

23:05.439 --> 23:08.158
- Most of them.
- But not all.

23:08.159 --> 23:10.600
- No.
- Why should you fancy every bloke?

23:10.600 --> 23:12.719
JP's just not your type.

23:12.720 --> 23:16.000
You require someone
with a strong throwing arm.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.759
That someone
might come along tomorrow.

23:18.760 --> 23:21.238
(Simon) Or the day after that...

23:21.239 --> 23:22.779
or the day after that.

23:30.719 --> 23:33.719
(â™ª Feeder: Standing On The Edge)

23:35.320 --> 23:36.918
No.

23:36.919 --> 23:38.799
â™ª There's a message on my bed... â™ª

23:38.799 --> 23:41.559
No.

23:41.560 --> 23:44.519
â™ª A new engraving
in my overloading head... â™ª

23:44.519 --> 23:46.318
No.

23:46.319 --> 23:49.119
â™ª Feel the walls are caving in... â™ª

23:49.120 --> 23:50.559
No.

23:50.559 --> 23:53.569
â™ª As the wire cuts into my butter skin... â™ª

23:53.839 --> 23:56.839
Definitely not.

24:03.680 --> 24:06.158
Not one bloke out of hundreds.

24:06.159 --> 24:09.159
Could take longer than one morning.

24:15.719 --> 24:18.760
As soon as you've finished
your teas and coffees

24:18.760 --> 24:21.120
if we could make our way into the hall?

24:21.120 --> 24:24.830
Tutors, make sure you turn up
at your allotted times.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
Thank you.

24:29.039 --> 24:31.559
You know you're one of only two people

24:31.559 --> 24:34.359
who have the slightest interest in this?

24:34.360 --> 24:38.079
While the other person's Clare,
I have to stand here like an idiot

24:38.079 --> 24:41.369
trying to inject some
enthusiasm and sincerity.

24:41.559 --> 24:43.479
As long as you know.

24:43.480 --> 24:46.700
If I forget,
I've always got you to remind me.

24:54.600 --> 24:57.239
- You've been summoned.
- Sorry?

24:57.240 --> 25:00.240
Boss wants to see you after school.

25:02.040 --> 25:06.380
So everyone here is completely
happy with where they're going?

25:06.720 --> 25:09.560
Nothing I say
is gonna change your minds?

25:09.560 --> 25:13.340
Then today's Careers Fair
is a complete waste of time?

25:13.399 --> 25:16.318
Can we use the session
to do homework?

25:16.319 --> 25:18.039
(Drops board rubber)

25:18.040 --> 25:19.878
I let you skive off

25:19.879 --> 25:24.009
and the best thing you can think of
to do is your homework?

25:25.279 --> 25:28.279
Fantastic.

25:31.599 --> 25:34.889
Not one of you has a clue
what they want to do?

25:37.160 --> 25:39.119
(Sighs)

25:39.120 --> 25:42.760
So apart from running
a lucrative protection racket,

25:43.120 --> 25:45.799
- you two have no other career ideas?
- No.

25:45.799 --> 25:49.369
No skills you've learnt
during your years at school

25:49.400 --> 25:51.918
which could help you find a career?

25:51.919 --> 25:54.919
Can you think of any?

25:55.640 --> 25:58.790
If our paths should
ever cross in later life,

25:59.679 --> 26:02.398
just remember
I was a really top bloke

26:02.399 --> 26:05.399
and liked you very, very much.

26:08.519 --> 26:11.519
(â™ª Feeder: Standing On The Edge)

26:16.119 --> 26:18.719
â™ª And I've been waiting for you

26:18.720 --> 26:21.118
â™ª For you to show me through

26:21.119 --> 26:22.799
â™ª A gate that opens wide

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
â™ª Where the sun never dies... â™ª

26:27.399 --> 26:30.680
- Come in.
- We just came to get some netballs.

26:30.680 --> 26:33.680
â™ª ..sun never dies

26:36.639 --> 26:39.118
â™ª And this is my home

26:39.119 --> 26:42.479
â™ª And this is my home
where the sun is shining â™ª

26:42.760 --> 26:45.759
- Why does she wanna see me?
- Zzz!

26:45.760 --> 26:48.519
You can't give me one tiny clue?

26:48.520 --> 26:52.580
It's nothing to do with
your masterly skills as a teacher.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.999
Why can't anyone be straight here?

26:55.999 --> 26:58.120
Oh, giving yourself your own clues now?

26:58.120 --> 27:01.120
(Buzzer)

27:02.319 --> 27:05.319
(Liz) Good luck.

27:09.039 --> 27:12.319
I'm all for people
referring to their sexuality

27:12.319 --> 27:16.449
to develop a more open,
honest relationship with colleagues

27:17.239 --> 27:21.229
but not using school property
as a personal notice board.

27:22.519 --> 27:25.519
Sorry?

27:25.599 --> 27:28.359
Celebrate your sexuality, by all means

27:28.360 --> 27:32.490
but don't alienate people
by ramming it down their throats.

27:33.839 --> 27:36.318
So to speak.

27:36.319 --> 27:39.319
(Buzzer)

27:46.479 --> 27:50.259
For what it's worth,
we both admire what you're doing.

27:52.120 --> 27:54.119
It can't be easy.

27:54.120 --> 27:57.120
All power to you.

28:09.599 --> 28:12.279
Are they in the staff room -
Simon and Kurt?

28:12.279 --> 28:15.779
- Didn't see them. Why?
- Cos I'm gonna kill them.

28:18.960 --> 28:22.679
- Brian wants you and he's pissed off.
- How pissed off?

28:22.679 --> 28:25.080
- Says he's gonna kill you.
- That pissed off.

28:25.080 --> 28:28.650
- Did we push him too far?
- Nah, he was loving it.

28:30.479 --> 28:32.999
I think I'll head straight off.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.838
Don't need anything
from the staff room?

28:35.839 --> 28:38.679
Just a jacket. I can leave it till tomorrow.

28:38.679 --> 28:41.080
No reason for me to go in there either.

28:41.080 --> 28:44.230
- Cowards.
- You think we're scared of Brian?

28:46.680 --> 28:49.680
The marking in my locker
can wait as well.

28:54.640 --> 28:58.680
Can anyone explain why no one
turned up for the Careers Fair?

28:58.680 --> 29:01.680
Not right now, no.

29:02.520 --> 29:05.520
(Growling)

29:18.759 --> 29:21.399
- Was Clare pissed off?
- No.

29:21.400 --> 29:26.039
She took it as an indication
that we'd worked so hard with the kids

29:26.039 --> 29:30.039
that most already had a clear idea
of what they wanted to do.

29:30.039 --> 29:32.078
- You're joking?
- Yes.

29:32.079 --> 29:34.920
She wants me to see everybody
after school tomorrow

29:34.920 --> 29:38.210
to assess the whole
Focus On The Future fiasco.

29:38.519 --> 29:41.599
So shall we say 3:45
for tomorrow's debrief?

29:42.079 --> 29:44.719
I'd love to but I've got a dental thing.

29:44.719 --> 29:48.999
Brian's planning a major breakdown
and I promised I'd be there.

29:48.999 --> 29:51.079
- JP?
- No.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.998
Why not?

29:52.999 --> 29:55.960
It's extra-curricular
so I don't need an excuse.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.320
Fine.

29:57.320 --> 30:00.610
Erm, am I hearing things
or did you say "fine"?

30:00.920 --> 30:03.760
It's extra-curricular,
I can't make him do it.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.559
- I'm not doing it cos I don't want to.
- Nor me.

30:06.559 --> 30:09.559
- OK.
- What, that's it?

30:09.839 --> 30:12.989
I can only ask.
If you say "no" you say "no".

30:13.320 --> 30:17.879
I don't give a toss. Don't let the hours
of extra work for me affect you.

30:17.879 --> 30:19.799
Great.

30:19.800 --> 30:22.800
Here they all are.

30:22.840 --> 30:25.799
Planning more jokes to play on me?

30:25.800 --> 30:28.800
- Sorry?
- The magazines were annoying.

30:29.999 --> 30:32.520
Pictures in the locker
were going a bit far

30:32.520 --> 30:34.519
but who the hell talked to Clare?

30:34.519 --> 30:36.679
Does Clare know?

30:36.680 --> 30:39.900
It's just a big laugh to you.
I'm a big laugh.

30:39.999 --> 30:43.839
A big, useless lump to take
the piss out of whenever you want.

30:43.839 --> 30:47.239
- "It's only Brian."
- We didn't mean to upset you.

30:47.239 --> 30:50.239
- Well, I am upset. Fucking upset.
- Bri!

30:51.199 --> 30:54.840
I'm trying to sort things out
and you just take the piss!

30:54.840 --> 30:58.550
- Why don't you sit down...
- I don't wanna sit down.

30:59.080 --> 31:01.198
From now on...

31:01.199 --> 31:04.199
you can all just fuck off.

31:09.039 --> 31:12.189
(Susan) Hands up
who feels like a total shit.

31:17.559 --> 31:21.619
I haven't done anything
but I don't want to feel left out.

31:29.639 --> 31:32.319
I think you ought to go and talk to him.

31:32.319 --> 31:35.118
Er, he'll be all right in the morning.

31:35.119 --> 31:38.129
It's best to leave him when he's like this.

31:40.559 --> 31:43.559
- (Knocks)
- Brian?

31:44.959 --> 31:47.959
He's not here.

31:49.759 --> 31:52.759
He really is pissed off.

31:53.120 --> 31:55.160
Think we ought to look for him?

31:55.160 --> 31:59.710
He left Marjorie. If it was serious,
he'd have taken his chicken.

32:00.959 --> 32:03.959
(â™ª The Hives: Main Offender)

32:17.599 --> 32:20.599
â™ª I'm on my way

32:20.920 --> 32:23.920
â™ª Can't settle down

32:25.119 --> 32:28.119
â™ª Stuck in ways of being an ass

32:28.480 --> 32:31.560
â™ª I got a lotta nerve that I'm ready to pass

32:31.560 --> 32:34.560
â™ª I'm on my way

32:35.159 --> 32:38.159
â™ª Can't settle down

32:39.160 --> 32:42.160
â™ª I'm stuck in ways of sadistic joy... â™ª

32:45.080 --> 32:48.959
- (Simon) What's the tactic?
- We don't want to upset him again.

32:48.959 --> 32:51.079
- So?
- We grovel?

32:51.080 --> 32:54.600
We make it clear how bad we feel
about what's happened

32:54.600 --> 32:56.760
and if there's any way
to make it up -

32:56.760 --> 32:59.518
however humiliating - we will.

32:59.519 --> 33:02.519
Grovel it is.

33:09.560 --> 33:12.920
- Where the hell were you?
- What about crawling?

33:12.920 --> 33:16.479
Fuck me, what have you done?
You weren't that desperate?

33:16.479 --> 33:19.319
- I was shaving.
- With a hedge trimmer?

33:19.320 --> 33:21.319
Scalpel from the biology lab.

33:21.319 --> 33:24.239
- Anything could have happened!
- Like what?

33:24.239 --> 33:27.669
You were emotional,
you were capable of anything.

33:27.839 --> 33:32.279
Were you worried something had
happened or how you'd feel if it had?

33:32.279 --> 33:34.719
You couldn't pick up a fucking phone?

33:34.719 --> 33:39.269
What Kurt's trying to say
in his own caring way is... are you OK?

33:41.640 --> 33:43.559
What do you care?

33:43.560 --> 33:46.318
You're still pissed off, fair enough.

33:46.319 --> 33:48.349
It was a wind-up, that's all!

33:48.920 --> 33:51.920
Really sensitively handled. Well done.

33:58.840 --> 34:01.118
- Cup of coffee?
- I can do it.

34:01.119 --> 34:02.959
No, let me.

34:02.960 --> 34:05.918
- How's it going?
- Pretty good. You?

34:05.919 --> 34:07.719
Great.

34:07.720 --> 34:10.600
- What's happened to you?
- Blunt scalpel.

34:10.600 --> 34:12.638
That'll do it.

34:12.639 --> 34:14.679
Can I top you up?

34:14.679 --> 34:18.530
- What's he doing?
- I don't know but it's frightening.

34:21.880 --> 34:25.659
Thank you for all your efforts
over the last few days.

34:25.998 --> 34:28.998
Those of you who have
put any effort in.

34:30.799 --> 34:32.879
What's the schedule for today?

34:32.879 --> 34:38.268
I had hoped to have a debrief session
but most of the tutors are unavailable.

34:38.280 --> 34:41.918
They can't find five minutes
to benefit their students?

34:41.918 --> 34:44.918
- Apparently not.
- Really?

34:45.079 --> 34:47.319
I'd like to hear the reasons why.

34:47.319 --> 34:50.819
- I can change my plans.
- Me too - not a problem.

34:53.119 --> 34:56.119
I've already said I can't do it.

34:56.360 --> 34:59.360
You can't cancel what you're doing?

35:00.040 --> 35:01.838
Sorry.

35:01.839 --> 35:03.600
Can you manage with who you have?

35:03.600 --> 35:05.918
- I think so.
- Good.

35:05.919 --> 35:09.419
You haven't heard the last
of Focus On The Future.

35:09.560 --> 35:13.319
Carol will be handing out
questionnaires to all tutors

35:13.319 --> 35:17.729
and I'll require reasons why
it wasn't all it should have been.

35:18.760 --> 35:21.760
That goes for everyone.

35:22.679 --> 35:24.478
(All exhale)

35:24.479 --> 35:27.679
- Thanks for becoming available.
- Don't mention it.

35:27.679 --> 35:30.478
(Women laughing)

35:30.479 --> 35:33.479
Hang on a sec, mate!

35:33.560 --> 35:35.918
(Brian) ..and we had a laugh...

35:35.919 --> 35:40.040
- How long will he keep this up?
- As long as it takes for him to work out

35:40.040 --> 35:43.470
that we really do know
we went too far this time.

35:44.319 --> 35:46.478
(Bell)

35:46.479 --> 35:48.478
What's this, a delegation?

35:48.479 --> 35:52.189
- (Kurt) It's Brian.
- What have you done to him now?

35:52.280 --> 35:55.500
- He's really fucked off.
- Can you blame him?

35:57.280 --> 36:00.639
- Will you have a word?
- Why can't you have a word?

36:00.639 --> 36:06.099
He doesn't want anything to do with us.
This gay stuff's got him all confused.

36:06.479 --> 36:09.479
It'd be better from a... expert.

36:10.239 --> 36:12.519
If you're prepared for the consequences.

36:12.519 --> 36:14.019
What consequences?

36:14.239 --> 36:17.239
If he's still confused,
there's one of two ways it can go.

36:17.239 --> 36:20.239
It might not end
the way you want it to.

36:21.679 --> 36:25.179
Four times in two weeks.
You're just not on there.

36:25.480 --> 36:29.039
How many times do I have to tell you?
How many times?

36:29.039 --> 36:33.239
- There's your target.
- Just get in there and sort him out.

36:33.559 --> 36:36.559
- (Brian) Don't backchat me!
- Brian.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.920
(Brian) If I catch you with this again,
I will confiscate it.

36:44.920 --> 36:46.759
I've been thinking.

36:46.760 --> 36:50.759
This gay thing with Brian
may not be so bad for you after all.

36:50.759 --> 36:53.159
He may learn to cook or something.

36:53.160 --> 36:57.290
Become a little more house-proud,
more sensitive, caring...

37:00.159 --> 37:03.159
Mmm!

37:05.919 --> 37:08.919
I'm scared.

37:10.159 --> 37:13.799
(JP) I've been thinking
about what you said earlier.

37:13.800 --> 37:15.399
What?

37:15.400 --> 37:20.159
Whether someone can live as one thing
and then find they're something else.

37:20.159 --> 37:22.559
- It's all right now.
- It is?

37:22.560 --> 37:25.560
- Yeah.
- No confusion?

37:26.319 --> 37:29.819
You've been talking to those wankers,
haven't you?

37:29.880 --> 37:32.318
- They're really upset.
- Good.

37:32.319 --> 37:35.329
They're worried
you might still be mixed-up

37:35.559 --> 37:39.639
and that you quite liked some things
about being different.

37:39.639 --> 37:42.639
- There were a few.
- Like what?

37:46.240 --> 37:50.580
Do you find, as a gay man,
you can talk to women a lot easier?

37:51.999 --> 37:53.839
I suppose so.

37:53.840 --> 37:56.479
Same here - it's a fucking revelation!

37:56.479 --> 38:00.359
If I worry about my sexuality,
I have no trouble chatting to them!

38:00.359 --> 38:03.279
- But you're not a gay man.
- Can you tell?

38:03.279 --> 38:06.779
- I'll come to the point. Do you like men?
- Some.

38:07.360 --> 38:09.438
- In a sexual way?
- Sorry?

38:09.439 --> 38:12.959
- Do erect penises turn you on?
- You lot don't hang about!

38:12.959 --> 38:16.879
Would you like one stuck up your arse
or to stick yours up someone's arse?

38:16.879 --> 38:19.358
- Steady on!
- (Bell)

38:19.359 --> 38:21.799
Graham.

38:21.800 --> 38:26.700
Ignore what anyone, especially me,
tells you about your career choice.

38:27.080 --> 38:31.280
I might be pushing you in
a direction you don't wanna go in.

38:32.120 --> 38:34.319
I'm sure there are many, many

38:34.320 --> 38:37.470
semi-retarded aeronautic
engineers out there.

38:39.719 --> 38:41.599
(Sighs)

38:41.600 --> 38:44.959
I'm sure I already know the answer
to this but...

38:44.959 --> 38:47.959
how do you feel
the careers days went?

38:48.680 --> 38:51.680
Anyone got anything to say at all?

38:53.199 --> 38:56.199
- Curtis.
- I've been thinking about it.

38:56.479 --> 38:59.909
- And?
- I told my dad I need to take a year out.

39:00.999 --> 39:02.499
What... did he say?

39:03.359 --> 39:06.359
Nothing.

39:06.560 --> 39:09.438
Well, that's good.

39:09.439 --> 39:11.959
Then I mentioned the theatre thing.

39:11.960 --> 39:14.159
- And?
- He's coming in to see you.

39:14.159 --> 39:17.659
I never said you shouldn't
go into banking, did I?

39:17.680 --> 39:21.040
Not in so many words,
but I knew what you meant.

39:21.319 --> 39:26.079
I was making sure that the choice
you were making was the right one.

39:26.200 --> 39:29.078
- In your case I think it is.
- Is it?

39:29.079 --> 39:31.919
There's no need for your dad
to come here.

39:31.919 --> 39:36.189
Tell him that your teacher
was just highlighting alternatives

39:36.319 --> 39:38.718
so you'd be absolutely certain

39:38.719 --> 39:42.429
that banking really was
the job for you, which it is.

39:43.960 --> 39:45.759
Probably.

39:45.760 --> 39:48.760
(Bell)

39:58.919 --> 40:01.919
- Well, how'd it go?
- What did he say?

40:01.999 --> 40:04.520
I've never seen Brian like that before.

40:04.520 --> 40:07.520
- Like what?
- It's hard to explain.

40:08.720 --> 40:12.080
- Is he still angry?
- Not really angry, more...

40:12.599 --> 40:14.638
resigned.

40:14.639 --> 40:17.360
- Resigned to what?
- He wants to speak to you.

40:17.360 --> 40:19.799
- Me?
- Why not me?

40:19.800 --> 40:22.079
It's best to let her go on her own.

40:22.079 --> 40:25.089
Brian still has
unresolved issues with you.

40:26.319 --> 40:28.078
He's right.

40:28.079 --> 40:30.599
You go on your own.

40:30.600 --> 40:33.518
Yeah.

40:33.519 --> 40:35.839
(Inaudible)

40:35.840 --> 40:39.439
(Simon) What's he saying?
(Kurt) He said "bastard" again.

40:39.439 --> 40:41.679
Maybe I should've talked to him.

40:41.679 --> 40:43.518
Yeah...

40:43.519 --> 40:46.519
but he won't hit Susan.

41:09.199 --> 41:12.199
(Mouths)

41:25.679 --> 41:27.759
You all right?

41:27.760 --> 41:30.760
Never better.

41:31.120 --> 41:34.120
Not... angry?

41:34.320 --> 41:36.998
No.

41:36.999 --> 41:39.399
Furious?

41:39.400 --> 41:42.400
No.

41:44.319 --> 41:45.819
What's that?

41:46.239 --> 41:49.239
It's all about Section 28.

41:49.319 --> 41:54.319
Did you know no law prevents a teacher
referring to his or her sexual orientation

41:54.319 --> 41:58.589
if it's in the context of fostering
a relationship of honesty

41:59.080 --> 42:01.799
between teacher and pupil?

42:01.800 --> 42:03.839
Really?

42:03.840 --> 42:07.200
But your sexual orientation's
obvious, isn't it?

42:07.520 --> 42:10.520
Is it?

42:15.079 --> 42:17.558
I need to talk to you.

42:17.559 --> 42:20.559
Privately.

42:21.279 --> 42:24.279
There's... something you need to know.

42:27.080 --> 42:29.319
Oh, shit.

42:29.320 --> 42:32.078
Maybe we could go for a drink later?

42:32.079 --> 42:33.838
We always go for a drink.

42:33.839 --> 42:36.839
I mean, go for a drink.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
It is important.

42:55.279 --> 42:58.499
- He asked me out!
- I think it's quite sweet.

42:58.520 --> 43:00.519
You are fucking joking?

43:00.520 --> 43:03.559
It's only a drink.
You can say no at any time.

43:03.559 --> 43:05.560
It's a first date, after all.

43:05.560 --> 43:07.758
- This is not funny!
- I know.

43:07.759 --> 43:10.039
What the fuck am I gonna do?

43:10.040 --> 43:13.040
Go along with it
until it plays itself out.

43:13.040 --> 43:14.598
What if it doesn't?

43:14.599 --> 43:18.200
Ask JP what it was like
being gay in a straight flat.

43:18.200 --> 43:19.799
It was fine.

43:19.800 --> 43:22.879
Then being straight
in a gay flat should be fine.

43:22.879 --> 43:26.099
Just get used to
listening to Barbra Streisand

43:27.519 --> 43:30.519
and watching old Bette Davis movies.

43:34.159 --> 43:37.159
- No JP?
- I asked him to explain to Brian

43:37.840 --> 43:41.120
how to keep an alternative
lifestyle... alternative.

43:41.120 --> 43:45.250
They're probably down
the Pink Flamingo drinking daiquiris.

43:45.960 --> 43:50.370
OK, I'm ready to hear your feeble
excuses for the Careers Fair.

43:50.639 --> 43:52.519
Brian! Want a drink, mate?

43:52.520 --> 43:55.159
Er, Bacardi and coke. Cheers.

43:55.160 --> 43:58.240
- Bacardi and coke?
- With a twist of lemon.

44:00.799 --> 44:02.958
Any chance of that word now?

44:02.959 --> 44:05.158
Can't it... wait?

44:05.159 --> 44:08.159
No.

44:12.759 --> 44:15.759
Shit.

44:16.520 --> 44:18.359
(Penny) What's happening?

44:18.360 --> 44:21.279
Brian's about to declare
his undying love.

44:21.279 --> 44:24.279
Oh, sweet.

44:29.960 --> 44:33.250
I really respect you.
And you mean a lot to me.

44:35.040 --> 44:39.730
My feelings for you have grown
into something more than friendship.

44:41.439 --> 44:45.429
It's only recently I've realised
how much you mean to me.

44:47.279 --> 44:49.078
That's, er...

44:49.079 --> 44:52.079
But I've also realised it's not enough.

44:52.399 --> 44:54.519
(Kurt) Isn't it?

44:54.520 --> 44:56.759
You were right about me and JP.

44:56.760 --> 44:59.760
I do have feelings for him.
Deep feelings.

45:01.639 --> 45:04.358
Shit.

45:04.359 --> 45:07.359
In fact, we want to live together.

45:08.760 --> 45:10.958
- You already do.
- (Sighs)

45:10.959 --> 45:14.879
I know how hard it would be for you,
seeing us every day

45:16.159 --> 45:18.919
and I think it best for all of us...

45:18.920 --> 45:21.920
especially you, if you moved out.

45:24.959 --> 45:27.959
You... want me out of the flat?

45:30.679 --> 45:33.079
Two's company and three's a crowd.

45:33.080 --> 45:36.090
Especially if the third's not... one of us.

45:36.520 --> 45:39.520
- (Chokes)
- (Kurt) But you're not gay!

45:39.800 --> 45:41.918
That's what I thought, too.

45:41.919 --> 45:46.049
But everything you and Simon have said
suddenly made sense.

45:46.600 --> 45:50.359
Everything you pointed out to me
proved to me I was wrong.

45:50.359 --> 45:53.929
It was a wind-up, for fuck's sake!
Tell him it was!

45:55.479 --> 45:57.840
I was making it up! I didn't mean it!

45:57.840 --> 46:01.620
- All the evidence is there.
- No, it was a piss-take!

46:02.040 --> 46:05.040
You want irrefutable evidence?
Show him.

46:12.440 --> 46:16.290
- What's this?
- This is where the whole thing started.

46:16.519 --> 46:20.040
I made it up about
hairdresser and flight attendant.

46:20.040 --> 46:23.720
Your real result is fireman.
Police officer. Builder!

46:23.720 --> 46:26.720
Fireman?

46:28.000 --> 46:30.599
I'm sorry.

46:30.600 --> 46:33.600
How sorry?

46:35.999 --> 46:38.999
Really... really sorry.

46:40.600 --> 46:43.600
About fucking time!

46:45.360 --> 46:48.720
- Take this back and get us a pint.
- (Laughter)

46:50.399 --> 46:53.399
You are a conniving, piss-taking twat!

46:55.400 --> 46:58.690
And you are a lying,
back-stabbing little shit.

46:59.600 --> 47:02.600
That's cleared that up, then.

47:03.000 --> 47:06.280
I have learnt one important
lesson from all this.

47:06.280 --> 47:09.280
Humility?
Compassion? Understanding?

47:09.319 --> 47:12.639
It's easier to get on with women
when you're a queen.

47:12.639 --> 47:16.360
Next time I go on the pull
I'm going gay, no question.

47:16.360 --> 47:17.959
(All jeer)

47:17.960 --> 47:20.960
Fireman, policeman,
construction worker.

47:21.840 --> 47:25.060
Isn't that three-fifths
of the Village People?

47:25.880 --> 47:28.880
(All jeer loudly)
