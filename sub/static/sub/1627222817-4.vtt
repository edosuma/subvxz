WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.440
I don't see why things have
to change.

00:01.440 --> 00:03.160
Because you keep putting it off.

00:03.160 --> 00:04.560
You said that you were ready!

00:04.560 --> 00:07.920
Do you even want to move in
together? Stop asking me, OK?

00:07.920 --> 00:09.800
I just... I just need some space.

00:09.800 --> 00:12.400
If you don't want me here,
I can go. No!

00:12.400 --> 00:15.280
I didn't mean that!
You're not listening to me!

00:15.280 --> 00:17.720
Do you know what? I am listening.
I loved you.

00:17.720 --> 00:20.800
And I wanted to know you. And
you don't even like that about me.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.560
 Firing order received
on the broadcast.

00:24.560 --> 00:27.040
Repeat. Firing order received
on the broadcast.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.320
Weapons Engineering Officers to
the control room.

00:34.320 --> 00:37.480
Repeat. Weapons Engineering Officers
to the control room.

00:39.920 --> 00:41.680
Weapons Engineering Officer's
here, sir.

00:41.680 --> 00:43.880
Firing orders received.
In the clear.

00:50.080 --> 00:51.840
Stand by. Stand by.

00:51.840 --> 00:53.120
Firing orders received.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.320
Firing order received 0100.

01:02.640 --> 01:05.520
Ship Control, bring the submarine to
Action Stations Missile

01:05.520 --> 01:06.640
for a missile launch.

01:14.880 --> 01:17.600
Adams! Sorry, we're getting the boat
to launch depth.

01:18.760 --> 01:20.320
Adams! Ah!

01:24.880 --> 01:28.520
 Action stations. Action
stations. All compartments close up.

01:28.520 --> 01:31.600
Submarine is going to ordered
launch depth.

01:31.600 --> 01:34.800
The firing unit keys have been
issued to the SMO.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.920
WEO command, set condition 1SQ.

01:37.920 --> 01:40.480
You all right there? Yeah.

01:40.480 --> 01:44.160
Yeah. You're hurt, we should get you
to the medic.

01:44.160 --> 01:47.600
No, I'm... Repeat, launch procedures
have been authorised.

01:47.600 --> 01:49.360
Set condition 1SQ.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.600
Take the submarine to
ordered launch depth.

02:01.160 --> 02:02.560
Is released for launch.

02:02.560 --> 02:05.480
Commander, at launch depth.
What? What's happening?

02:05.480 --> 02:07.040
Better get her out.

02:07.040 --> 02:08.360
What? No!

02:08.360 --> 02:11.080
Out of the control room. Now.
Amy, you've had your instructions.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.200
You need to leave the control room.
Instructions?

02:13.200 --> 02:15.720
What's wrong with your head?
Nothing, I just banged it.

02:15.720 --> 02:20.600
Weapon System in 1SQ. Weapon System
in 1SQ. WEO, Command, roger.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.720
What did he mean, weapons?
Out you go, Amy.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.480
WEO, Command, you have my
permission to fire.

02:28.480 --> 02:29.920
What? STOP!

02:29.920 --> 02:31.040
Amy!

02:36.480 --> 02:39.840
It's just a drill. It's just
a drill. It's just a drill.

02:39.840 --> 02:41.200
It's just a drill.

02:41.200 --> 02:42.920
 Launch drill
completed.

02:42.920 --> 02:44.720
Repeat. Launch drill completed.

02:48.520 --> 02:49.680
Get her to the sickbay.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.600
Amy.

02:53.600 --> 02:54.840
Carry on, everyone.

02:58.120 --> 02:59.160
Um...

03:06.240 --> 03:07.840
Amy.

03:07.840 --> 03:10.000
Amy, are you OK?

03:10.000 --> 03:11.080
Are you all right?

03:26.000 --> 03:29.240
# Do you want me on your mind?

03:29.240 --> 03:35.040
# Or do you want me to go on?

03:37.840 --> 03:44.440
# I might be yours as sure as
I can say

03:44.440 --> 03:48.520
# Be gone, be far away... #

04:19.760 --> 04:23.120
You made a statement to the Navy
regarding an incident

04:23.120 --> 04:25.120
in Port Havers.

04:25.120 --> 04:27.160
That's part of an ongoing inquiry.

04:27.160 --> 04:29.520
You'll need to speak
to my superiors. We have.

04:34.320 --> 04:37.440
What happened in Port Havers is
highly classified so whoever

04:37.440 --> 04:41.240
leaked it to you is breaking the law
and compromising national security.

04:41.240 --> 04:44.640
Now, you know that you are obliged
to co-operate with us today.

04:44.640 --> 04:47.080
And failure to do so will see you
facing charges.

04:47.080 --> 04:50.520
In the best-case scenario,
that's your career gone.

04:50.520 --> 04:52.840
I haven't shared my information
with anyone.

04:55.040 --> 04:57.040
You met with Patrick Cruden
this afternoon.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.880
What was the nature of that
conversation?

05:00.880 --> 05:02.560
How long have you been following me?

05:02.560 --> 05:05.120
Did you discuss
Port Havers with him?

05:05.120 --> 05:07.640
He was trying to help me
find Jade Antoniak's killer.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.400
You haven't answered my question.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.280
He suspects the Navy covered up
an incident in Florida,

05:14.280 --> 05:16.080
but he doesn't know what happened.

05:16.080 --> 05:19.000
Well, obviously, you're concerned
about the information Cruden is

05:19.000 --> 05:20.640
leaking to the press.

05:20.640 --> 05:23.360
I assume you were aware of his
relationship with Jade.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.520
We're familiar with her. Yes.

05:30.480 --> 05:33.480
Was MI5 running surveillance on
Dunloch peace camp?

05:33.480 --> 05:35.280
We monitor them.

05:35.280 --> 05:38.680
Their activities, who they talk to.
But it's a light touch.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.200
Why do you monitor them?

05:40.200 --> 05:41.960
All the reasons that you'd expect.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.240
Most of them are harmless,
but not all of them,

05:44.240 --> 05:47.160
especially when they link up
with other activist groups.

05:47.160 --> 05:49.560
In August there was a demo which
involved three groups

05:49.560 --> 05:51.320
and it got violent.

05:52.880 --> 05:55.080
Jade told me you had operatives
in the camp.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.520
What were they doing there?

06:03.160 --> 06:05.480
You've had plenty of time to
ask your questions.

06:05.480 --> 06:08.160
Anything else you can
submit in writing.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.200
Let's go.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.120
Whilst we respect your
independence...

06:12.120 --> 06:14.120
That's very gracious of you.
..there are issues of

06:14.120 --> 06:16.320
national security here.

06:16.320 --> 06:19.280
We need you to keep a dialogue
open with us.

06:19.280 --> 06:20.480
Yes.

06:20.480 --> 06:23.080
We'll be sure to go through all
the proper channels.

06:28.480 --> 06:29.800
I had no choice in the matter.

06:29.800 --> 06:32.320
By the time they told me, you were
already in with them.

06:32.320 --> 06:34.320
They've been following me
since I met with Cruden.

06:34.320 --> 06:35.680
Maybe earlier.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.400
So, what did you get out of them?

06:37.400 --> 06:39.280
I asked about operatives
in the camp.

06:39.280 --> 06:41.080
They didn't give me a straight
answer.

06:41.080 --> 06:42.560
I've got a few ideas, though. OK.

06:42.560 --> 06:45.200
Let's get you home.
We can pick this up in the morning.

06:58.880 --> 07:01.200
 Fall out from Action
Stations.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.120
Second watch. Watch dived.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.320
Second watch.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.040
Are you all right?

07:18.400 --> 07:20.960
Could you tell the Cox'n I'd like
to see him?

07:20.960 --> 07:22.120
I'll meet him in his office.

07:23.240 --> 07:24.360
Yes, ma'am.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.040
 Your team come up
from there. Yeah.

07:34.040 --> 07:36.400
And then we come down from
there. Yes.

07:36.400 --> 07:39.600
Actually, can I leave that with you
for a second? I'll type it up.

07:45.960 --> 07:48.000
Tea or coffee? Hm?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.920
Or, I mean, you could try the soup
if you're feeling masochistic.

07:50.920 --> 07:54.560
Kirsten Longacre. DS. I just
transferred from CID.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.480
Amy Silva. DCI. I know.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.360
When did they put this machine in?

07:58.360 --> 08:01.280
When the clamour for bad soup got
too loud to ignore.

08:01.280 --> 08:04.120
I wanted to ask you something,
if you don't mind.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.240
I've got my Inspector
interview coming up

08:06.240 --> 08:09.640
and Robertson said that you would be
the best person to help me prep.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.680
Now's not a good time. Sorry.

08:12.680 --> 08:14.240
OK. No worries.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.800
Can I buy you a hot chocolate?
No. I'm good.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.000
No, I'd like to.

08:22.520 --> 08:24.000
Erm...

08:24.000 --> 08:26.640
So, what would you say is the
biggest mistake people

08:26.640 --> 08:28.000
make in their interviews?

08:31.000 --> 08:32.040
Mm.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.600
Yes? Yeah, five minutes.
Thank you. OK.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.360
Thank you, that is all I need.

08:53.720 --> 08:55.840
They said you were waiting for me.

08:55.840 --> 08:57.680
Why didn't you tell me
it was a drill?

08:59.920 --> 09:03.200
It's our job to complete the test as
quickly as possible.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.360
Not to calm you down.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.200
How are you feeling, anyway? Are you
OK? I think you should sit down.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.120
Are you having an affair with
Tiffany Docherty?

09:22.320 --> 09:24.560
What? I think you're the man in
those pictures.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.880
And Craig Burke was using them
to blackmail you.

09:28.280 --> 09:31.040
He needed information on Port
Havers. On the two contractors.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.160
The accident. You knew about that,
didn't you?

09:33.160 --> 09:34.760
I can't... I can't discuss that.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.960
He was going to leak it to
the press, exposing the Navy's

09:36.960 --> 09:39.400
cover-up. I think he needed your
help to do that.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.880
No, it wasn't like... OK, if you're
not going to be honest with me,

09:41.880 --> 09:44.040
we can go to the Captain. We can
have this conversation

09:44.040 --> 09:45.120
in front of him.

09:54.680 --> 09:56.360
So now you're blackmailing me, too?

09:59.880 --> 10:00.920
So you did help him?

10:04.320 --> 10:05.800
So, when did he approach you?

10:06.960 --> 10:08.760
Just a couple of weeks
before the patrol.

10:08.760 --> 10:10.760
Did you give him any evidence?
Any proof it happened?

10:10.760 --> 10:13.120
There wasn't any. Not that I would
have given it to him

10:13.120 --> 10:16.000
even if there was. He must have
needed something to go to the press.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Otherwise the Navy would just deny
the whole story.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.560
And he had that photo of you,

10:19.560 --> 10:22.800
so he could have just kept pushing
you, asking you for more.

10:22.800 --> 10:26.920
He had the power to ruin your
career, your marriage, your family.

10:26.920 --> 10:29.560
The only way that's going to go
away is if Craig Burke did.

10:29.560 --> 10:30.840
So...

10:30.840 --> 10:33.360
Are you implying that I had
something to do with his death?

10:33.360 --> 10:35.000
You were with him the day of
the trawler.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.480
You've lied to me throughout this
whole fucking investigation!

10:37.480 --> 10:40.640
What! This is... This is ridiculous.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.680
I didn't kill Craig Burke!

10:42.680 --> 10:44.880
How would I have even done
that anyway?

10:44.880 --> 10:48.640
Do you know what? It doesn't even
matter what you think any more.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.840
Not after that stunt you pulled
today in the control room.

10:50.840 --> 10:55.200
Excuse me? Everyone on this boat
thinks that you are deranged!

10:55.200 --> 10:56.480
It was only me that didn't.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.640
Now you're on your own.

11:54.720 --> 11:57.400
Rough night?
I've not slept much.

11:57.400 --> 12:00.000
I've gone through all this footage
from the loch-side the night Jade

12:00.000 --> 12:02.600
was killed. So far, not much.

12:02.600 --> 12:06.040
Leave that for a sec, there's
something else I want to look at.

12:06.040 --> 12:08.480
Jade told me that she was in a train
station on her way

12:08.480 --> 12:11.480
back from a protest
and she recognised someone.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.320
Now, she thought he was MI5.

12:13.320 --> 12:15.880
And I'm thinking... Well, no,
I'm hoping

12:15.880 --> 12:17.520
that maybe a camera picked it up.

12:17.520 --> 12:19.720
Do you know when? And which station?

12:19.720 --> 12:23.080
MI5 mentioned a protest that got
violent in August.

12:23.080 --> 12:24.240
You could start there.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.640
Yeah. That was here in Glasgow.

12:32.880 --> 12:36.480
OK, well, let's look at both ends of
the line, Kirkmouth

12:36.480 --> 12:38.720
and Glasgow Central.
See if we can spot Jade.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.920
No-one gets it first time.

13:01.320 --> 13:02.960
No-one.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.320
Well, that's good to know.

13:08.280 --> 13:11.360
Any tips, though?
Even just to fill the silence.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.520
Yeah, don't be too nice.

13:15.880 --> 13:19.400
Don't be an arse, but just don't be
too nice either, you know?

13:21.040 --> 13:24.440
You don't have to please everybody.
Not everyone deserves it.

13:24.440 --> 13:26.720
Spoken like a true misanthrope.

13:26.720 --> 13:28.480
You've sort of got to be,
haven't you?

13:28.480 --> 13:31.040
It's part of the job description.

13:31.040 --> 13:33.880
Trust no-one, don't get
emotionally involved.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.320
Have you ever thought about
motivational speaking?

13:38.680 --> 13:40.560
A great detective shuts herself off.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.760
She focuses on the work at the cost
of everything else.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.040
So, what you're saying, then, is...

13:51.120 --> 13:52.600
..accept total loneliness.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.440
OK.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.280
Do you really believe that?

13:59.280 --> 14:01.440
Yeah, wholeheartedly. Oh.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.200
So you do have a heart, then?
Despite what you're claiming?

14:04.200 --> 14:06.840
No. Not when I'm at work I don't.
Aye. But you're not always

14:06.840 --> 14:08.160
at work, though, are you?

14:14.600 --> 14:15.680
Breakfast, ma'am.

14:17.280 --> 14:18.800
Erm, thanks.

14:22.880 --> 14:25.920
I just heard about your son.
Found out this morning.

14:25.920 --> 14:28.920
He's getting out. That's amazing!

14:28.920 --> 14:30.680
They're just letting him go?

14:30.680 --> 14:32.680
I think there was new evidence
or something.

14:32.680 --> 14:34.760
Anyway, he'll be back home
waiting for me.

14:34.760 --> 14:36.880
I can't believe it! I know!

14:38.480 --> 14:40.880
I need to get back to this, hen. OK.

14:48.520 --> 14:52.280
DCI Silva, I need you in sickbay.
What for?

14:52.280 --> 14:54.040
I need to run a check-up on you.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.200
Captain's orders.

14:59.800 --> 15:00.880
OK.

15:08.920 --> 15:11.800
Mm, you haven't taken your
pain meds.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.120
I told you, I feel fine.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.920
OK, what's going on?

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
Surgeon Lieutenant Docherty,
can I have your report?

15:23.000 --> 15:25.720
DCI Silva's injury is superficial.

15:25.720 --> 15:27.280
No evidence of concussion.

15:27.280 --> 15:30.000
It's harder to say about
the medication.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.320
Sorry, what? It's been brought to my
attention that you have

15:32.320 --> 15:34.760
a serious medical condition, for
which you brought

15:34.760 --> 15:37.160
unauthorised medication on board.
Yeah, OK, I don't know

15:37.160 --> 15:40.200
what's been said... What are
the effects exactly of withdrawal

15:40.200 --> 15:41.680
from that medication?

15:41.680 --> 15:44.080
Trouble sleeping.
Poor balance.

15:44.080 --> 15:45.320
Anxiety.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.200
Psychosis is rare, but it
can happen.

15:49.120 --> 15:52.400
Do you think that might account for
your outburst this morning?

15:54.120 --> 15:56.000
I never told you about
my medication.

15:58.080 --> 15:59.440
You did mention it. No.

16:03.040 --> 16:05.000
Look. We're just trying to help
you, Amy.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.800
We're worried about you. That's all.
Oh, that's... That's kind.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.360
Look, Captain, this is some kind of
an attempt to undermine me.

16:10.360 --> 16:11.680
I witnessed your behaviour.

16:11.680 --> 16:14.080
I'd just woke up and no-one told
me it was...

16:14.080 --> 16:16.000
You know I didn't tell you about my
medication.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.200
I'm certain of that.

16:17.200 --> 16:20.360
So, Lieutenant Docherty must
have told you.

16:20.360 --> 16:22.760
You know these two are having an
affair, so this isn't about me.

16:22.760 --> 16:25.400
This is about them trying to make me
look... Cox'n assures me that there

16:25.400 --> 16:27.240
has been no inappropriate contact.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.800
OK, I need to interview the Cox'n
under caution.

16:37.800 --> 16:40.040
Craig Burke was gathering
information on Port Havers.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.600
He was going to take down the whole
boat, and the Cox'n knew that.

16:42.600 --> 16:45.680
He's already admitted to me
that Burke was blackmailing him.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.760
Do you have any evidence? That is
what I'm trying to do.

16:50.760 --> 16:54.440
I'm trying to gather evidence but
you're not giving me the appropriate
assistance. How so?

16:54.440 --> 16:56.720
You failed to mention the sinking of
the trawler.

16:56.720 --> 16:58.480
You failed to mention Port Havers.

17:00.320 --> 17:03.840
That is classified information which
has no bearing on this case.

17:03.840 --> 17:05.240
That isn't for you to judge.

17:07.840 --> 17:12.360
DCI Silva, I can't have you in
questionable health,

17:12.360 --> 17:15.800
disrupting drills, and making wild
accusations.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.920
I think you're unfit.
You're relieved of your duties.

17:19.920 --> 17:22.480
You don't have the authority to
do that. I do.

17:22.480 --> 17:24.520
And you'll stay in my cabin
for the rest of the day.

17:24.520 --> 17:26.840
You'll rest and you'll follow
Lieutenant Docherty's advice

17:26.840 --> 17:29.640
regarding your health. There is
someone on board Vigil who
is dangerous.

17:29.640 --> 17:31.520
I am trying to help you find out
who that is.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.520
I need your full support right
now. Why don't you...?

17:33.520 --> 17:37.200
Convince the medic that you are fit
for duty, and we'll revisit this.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.360
If you can't do that, I will confine
you to quarters

17:39.360 --> 17:41.000
for the duration of this patrol.

17:43.440 --> 17:44.480
Yes?

17:46.320 --> 17:49.240
Lieutenant Docherty will escort you
to my cabin now. Sir.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.880
Ah, cheers. There you go.

18:05.720 --> 18:07.000
Here's Jade.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.920
This is just outside Central Station
on the day of the protest.

18:10.920 --> 18:14.320
I've gone through all the cameras in
the area and picked up this guy.

18:17.240 --> 18:18.720
That's an ice hockey jacket.

18:20.840 --> 18:22.320
Can we get any closer?

18:32.520 --> 18:34.280
She just took their photo.

18:36.560 --> 18:37.960
Did they see her take that?

18:40.240 --> 18:42.080
Do we have footage inside
the station?

18:42.080 --> 18:44.360
Hasn't come through yet. Not sure
what we'd get on

18:44.360 --> 18:45.720
that other guy, though.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.360
Can't make out much with the cap.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.400
So, we know her phone is missing.

18:52.400 --> 18:56.120
Maybe someone took it. What else
have we got?

18:56.120 --> 19:00.200
We've pulled the local shops,
the car park, street cameras...

19:00.200 --> 19:01.240
Try the car park.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.560
There! That's him there.

19:20.480 --> 19:22.120
Let's get an address for that car.

19:24.880 --> 19:27.160
Car's registered to a Peter
Ingles, 44.

19:27.160 --> 19:28.960
Not much on him. No arrests.

19:40.240 --> 19:41.360
He's home.

20:02.960 --> 20:05.160
He's on the move!
There's got to be another way out.

20:05.160 --> 20:07.000
Bring the cars round the other side!

20:52.840 --> 20:55.480
Peter Ingles, you are under arrest
on suspicion

20:55.480 --> 20:57.040
of the murder of Jade Antoniak.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.480
Do you recognise this woman?

21:07.000 --> 21:08.520
No.

21:08.520 --> 21:11.160
Are you sure? Look again.

21:13.560 --> 21:15.120
Her name's Jade Antoniak.

21:16.440 --> 21:18.040
She would have recognised you.

21:19.120 --> 21:20.160
What do you mean?

21:23.840 --> 21:27.520
If she recognises me, why don't you
bring her in here?

21:27.520 --> 21:30.280
Maybe she can tell me
what this is all about.

21:30.280 --> 21:32.280
What happened to your shoulder?

21:32.280 --> 21:35.160
It started bleeding when I tackled
you to the ground.

21:35.160 --> 21:38.000
Custody sergeant said you refused
medical attention.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.040
I'm fine.

21:40.720 --> 21:42.640
No. I don't know about that.

21:44.240 --> 21:48.440
See, I think if we had that
examined, we would find a wound
there.

21:49.440 --> 21:52.640
Made by a pair of scissors
about three days ago.

21:54.760 --> 21:57.640
This is all clearly
a misunderstanding.

21:57.640 --> 22:00.320
You left blood all over my carpet,
Mr Ingles.

22:02.440 --> 22:04.200
You're not getting out of this one.

22:07.480 --> 22:09.200
I'd like to contact my lawyer now.

22:19.720 --> 22:22.080
They're only antihistamines.

22:22.080 --> 22:25.120
I can't force you to take them,
but I hope you will.

22:25.120 --> 22:27.160
Coming off antidepressants can be
really nasty,

22:27.160 --> 22:28.520
so these will help.

22:32.400 --> 22:34.800
Look. I know you want to protect
him, but...

22:34.800 --> 22:37.280
Covering up for him, that's not
going to help you.

22:38.720 --> 22:40.400
I'm not. He's a liar.

22:42.040 --> 22:44.600
He's certainly lied to his wife,
but you knew that.

22:46.440 --> 22:48.920
Doesn't it matter to you that you
can't trust him?

22:53.000 --> 22:54.120
Get some sleep, OK?

23:12.080 --> 23:14.040
How is she? Not good.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.880
You could've told me you were going
to the Captain.

23:20.560 --> 23:23.680
I was just trying to protect you.
Oh, were you?

23:25.240 --> 23:27.000
Yeah, of course. I need to go.

23:43.600 --> 23:47.440
If you didn't know Jade Antoniak,
how do you explain us

23:47.440 --> 23:50.040
finding this outside your flat?

23:53.040 --> 23:55.200
A digital forensics examination
has managed to

23:55.200 --> 23:59.200
recover 17 of the 20 integrated
circuit card numbers.

23:59.200 --> 24:00.680
They're a match with her SIM.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.400
Was it you she was meeting the night
she died?

24:06.400 --> 24:09.240
Or did you go after her because you
realised that she was onto you?

24:11.480 --> 24:14.560
Did you know that she'd taken photos
of you and your colleague?

24:16.440 --> 24:18.320
Why were you targeting her?

24:18.320 --> 24:20.080
You should co-operate.

24:20.080 --> 24:22.560
This, the bloodstains.

24:22.560 --> 24:23.960
See the big picture here.

24:25.600 --> 24:28.640
Mr Ingles, are you an MI5
intelligence officer?

24:38.600 --> 24:39.640
Well...

24:41.200 --> 24:42.480
This has been fun.

24:48.080 --> 24:50.120
What the hell's going on?

24:50.120 --> 24:53.000
The man you interviewed
isn't Peter Ingles.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.880
It's Piter Vasiliev.

24:54.880 --> 24:59.800
He works for the Russian embassy
and he has full diplomatic immunity.

24:59.800 --> 25:02.160
He's a GRU intelligence officer.

25:04.520 --> 25:06.520
Are you saying he's a Russian spy?

25:06.520 --> 25:10.000
Yes. And I'm afraid we have to
let him go.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.240
He murdered Jade.
You don't know that.

25:13.240 --> 25:15.760
And he's the man who attacked me.
Him and another. Kirsten,

25:15.760 --> 25:18.000
there's nothing we can do.
We can't let him go!

25:18.000 --> 25:20.080
The only thing we could do is
talk to the Russian embassy

25:20.080 --> 25:22.120
and ask them to waive his immunity.

25:22.120 --> 25:24.320
And we've done that and it's a no.

25:24.320 --> 25:26.400
He'll leave the country today.

25:26.400 --> 25:29.560
And after that the Foreign Office
will take it up as an issue.

25:29.560 --> 25:31.080
It's not an issue!

25:32.160 --> 25:34.480
He killed a girl who was barely in
her twenties!

25:34.480 --> 25:36.640
I'm afraid we have no choice in
the matter.

26:07.160 --> 26:09.840
If you'd kept us updated on your
investigation, like we asked,

26:09.840 --> 26:11.800
we wouldn't even be in this
situation. No.

26:11.800 --> 26:13.800
I don't accept that.
We could have watched him.

26:13.800 --> 26:16.120
And maybe even figured out who
he works with by now.

26:16.120 --> 26:18.480
Isn't it your job to know
that in the first place?

26:18.480 --> 26:20.840
Do you have any idea how many
Russian intelligence officers

26:20.840 --> 26:23.320
there are currently operating in
the UK?

26:23.320 --> 26:26.960
Our sources gave no indication
of him being active in that way.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.400
Intelligence officers with
diplomatic cover usually just

26:29.400 --> 26:31.720
run agents. They keep their
hands clean.

26:31.720 --> 26:34.880
So, this level of interference is
practically unheard of.

26:34.880 --> 26:39.040
Jade Antoniak managed to figure out
that something was going on.

26:39.040 --> 26:41.200
I think I have something.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.280
Thank Christ!

26:44.280 --> 26:45.720
I found this.

26:45.720 --> 26:47.720
It's an online thread
about fishing

26:47.720 --> 26:50.720
that Peter Ingles has been posting
on from this laptop.

26:50.720 --> 26:52.040
Someone's responded with more.

26:53.600 --> 26:55.720
But these aren't Ingles'
personal images.

26:55.720 --> 26:57.360
They're from all over the world.

26:57.360 --> 26:59.680
I think it could be some
sort of code

26:59.680 --> 27:02.160
hidden in the pixels of the photos.

27:02.160 --> 27:04.080
It's possible...

27:04.080 --> 27:05.520
We can decode these

27:05.520 --> 27:07.880
and look for encryptions
in the pixels.

27:07.880 --> 27:10.920
Who were they being sent to?
We'll look at the responses

27:10.920 --> 27:14.120
but it's likely they were sent
on a public network.

27:14.120 --> 27:17.160
How often are the exchanges?
A few times a week.

27:17.160 --> 27:20.480
Mostly concentrated over
a fortnight, before they stop.

27:20.480 --> 27:25.280
When was the last one?
It says here, the 30th of August.

27:27.200 --> 27:29.920
That's the day before Vigil
went out on patrol.

27:39.800 --> 27:43.800
Navigation, alter course to the
south, head for the shipping lane.

27:43.800 --> 27:45.080
Aye, sir.

27:46.400 --> 27:50.080
We're changing course?
New orders.

27:50.080 --> 27:54.640
We need to take additional measures
to avoid detection.

27:54.640 --> 27:58.520
Keep the team alert, Cox'n.
No more close-quarters situations.

27:58.520 --> 28:00.560
Yes, sir.

28:00.560 --> 28:03.880
Maintain depth
between 50 and 60 metres. Yes, sir.

29:02.720 --> 29:06.840
Oh, God, I don't...
I really don't do this.

29:06.840 --> 29:09.880
Oh! Not on a school night.
Well, I mean, that's good to know.

29:09.880 --> 29:13.360
Cos nobody should be drinking
this much whisky. No. Mm-mm.

29:13.360 --> 29:17.080
But it's a special occasion, so...
Mm-hm. Very true.

29:17.080 --> 29:20.600
Actually, on that,
here's to fucking up my interview.

29:22.520 --> 29:26.200
Again. Again. Oh, God, again.

29:28.160 --> 29:30.440
You look different
when you're having a good time.

29:30.440 --> 29:33.360
What? What do you mean?
I dunno, it's like your whole face,

29:33.360 --> 29:36.160
like it opens up. My what?

29:36.160 --> 29:39.200
It does. It's lovely. It's love...

29:42.680 --> 29:45.680
Oh. Um... I'm sorry.

29:48.480 --> 29:50.960
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have done that.

29:53.440 --> 29:55.560
I'm not.

29:55.560 --> 30:00.200
I did know that.
Erm...I did know that.

30:02.080 --> 30:05.520
Oh, God, I'm going to go.
Just cos we've got an early start.

30:25.520 --> 30:28.400
Based on the evidence
that we found at Ingles' flat,

30:28.400 --> 30:32.120
we're convinced that he was
responsible for Jade's death.

30:32.120 --> 30:36.160
And given the pattern
of messages that he sent,

30:36.160 --> 30:42.160
we think it's possible that he was
in contact with someone on the boat.

30:42.160 --> 30:46.160
So, you're saying there could be
a Russian asset onboard Vigil?

30:49.280 --> 30:50.920
No, this is...

30:50.920 --> 30:54.360
I—I don't believe that that's...

30:54.360 --> 30:58.920
They're all vetted. Yes,
but you have hundreds of sailors.

30:58.920 --> 31:02.360
People can slip through. We don't
have solid evidence of it yet.

31:02.360 --> 31:06.280
We're just trying to establish
any possible connection to Burke.

31:06.280 --> 31:10.120
As in...Burke was a Russian asset

31:10.120 --> 31:13.520
or...Burke was killed
by a Russian asset?

31:13.520 --> 31:15.840
These are the questions.

31:15.840 --> 31:17.720
We think Burke was a whistle-blower.

31:17.720 --> 31:20.600
I can't see the Russians
targeting him over that.

31:20.600 --> 31:23.720
If anything, they would
encourage a whistle-blower.

31:23.720 --> 31:26.040
Embarrassing us is a win for them.

31:26.040 --> 31:29.840
Unless he was going to be talking
about Russian spies in the Navy.

31:29.840 --> 31:32.440
Oh, come on.

31:32.440 --> 31:34.880
This is...fanciful stuff.

31:36.160 --> 31:40.120
We have presented an area
of concern. What about you?

31:40.120 --> 31:43.160
Is there anything we should know?

31:43.160 --> 31:46.880
Look, none of us are used to
opening our books to each other

31:46.880 --> 31:50.960
but we cannot afford to hold back.
Not now.

31:53.920 --> 31:56.960
Right. Nothing about Russians.
However...

31:59.680 --> 32:04.240
..there are concerns about
the trawler that went down
off Barra Head.

32:04.240 --> 32:07.520
At the peace camp they're saying
it was dragged down by a submarine.

32:07.520 --> 32:11.200
It was. An American submarine.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.560
We identified it
from the tiles that came off

32:13.560 --> 32:16.640
when it hit the trawler net.

32:16.640 --> 32:21.560
We have confronted the Americans
and they have admitted it.

32:23.160 --> 32:26.080
They'd been shadowing Vigil
since she left port.

32:26.080 --> 32:28.120
Why would they do that?

32:28.120 --> 32:30.120
They won't disclose that.

32:30.120 --> 32:32.120
And why wouldn't they tell you more?

32:32.120 --> 32:35.040
Well, I think in the light
of Mr Peter Ingles,

32:35.040 --> 32:37.560
they're going to have to
give us something.

32:41.120 --> 32:42.880
I'll have the conversation.

32:52.720 --> 32:56.280
..it wasn't until after
that I realised what happened

32:56.280 --> 33:00.040
in the first place and then...
Sir? Come and have a look at this.

33:00.040 --> 33:01.520
Two seconds, Jack.

33:03.200 --> 33:06.120
Walsh, what are you doing here?
You're supposed to be stood down.

33:06.120 --> 33:09.160
Yeah, I know, sir. I've been coming
down to check these padlocks...

33:09.160 --> 33:12.720
You see, it looks fine.
Then you turn it over.

33:12.720 --> 33:16.560
We used to jimmy locks all the time
when I was a kid. That's been
tampered wae.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.440
The RCMS panel is in here.

33:18.440 --> 33:21.240
You could use that
to force a reactor shutdown.

33:23.840 --> 33:27.960
Keep this to yourself until
I've spoken to the Captain. OK? Sir.

33:39.520 --> 33:41.800
Oh, God.

33:41.800 --> 33:45.480
Oh, I didn't mean to wake you.
I just brought you some scran.

33:45.480 --> 33:47.160
That's OK.

33:49.320 --> 33:53.720
Thanks, Jackie. That's good news
earlier. About your son.

33:53.720 --> 33:56.480
Must be a relief. Yeah, it is.

33:58.040 --> 34:01.560
What happened to him?
He just...

34:01.560 --> 34:04.160
He made some bad choices.
Teenage stuff.

34:04.160 --> 34:06.120
Got in some bother.

34:06.120 --> 34:08.800
He was in prison?

34:08.800 --> 34:11.920
I'm not judging, I... I see kids
all the time make mistakes.

34:11.920 --> 34:14.120
Sorry, love, I shouldnae be
talking to you.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.560
I've left some extra pudding
to cheer you up.

34:53.120 --> 34:55.800
Your report said you followed
Vigil for "operational reasons".

34:55.800 --> 35:00.640
Were you concerned that Russia might
be planning something with Vigil?

35:00.640 --> 35:03.120
I have told you what I can.

35:05.600 --> 35:09.760
Well, with respect, you'll have to
do better than that.

35:11.640 --> 35:13.720
The Americans
were concerned about the patrol

35:13.720 --> 35:17.200
but rather than share their concerns
with us, they chose to shadow Vigil.

35:17.200 --> 35:19.480
They didn't want to risk
their source.

35:19.480 --> 35:22.720
Do they have any idea
what the Russians are planning?

35:22.720 --> 35:24.040
No.

35:26.160 --> 35:29.120
We'll need to brief Downing Street.

35:29.120 --> 35:32.040
Right, Branning,
would you set that up, please?

35:32.040 --> 35:33.920
Yes, sir. Thank you.

35:33.920 --> 35:36.720
Can you call Vigil back
without a replacement ready?

35:36.720 --> 35:40.520
They won't want to do that.
They need proof of an active threat.

35:40.520 --> 35:43.840
Will you at least inform the
Captain? Yes. But the question is,

35:43.840 --> 35:46.240
what can Newsome do about it?

35:46.240 --> 35:50.360
If he puts guards on key systems,
they'll realise something's up.

35:50.360 --> 35:53.720
That in itself
could provoke an action.

35:53.720 --> 35:58.040
If there's a traitor onboard,
we need a name.

35:58.040 --> 36:00.280
That's how we protect Vigil.

36:08.560 --> 36:11.120
Are you absolutely sure?

36:11.120 --> 36:12.520
Yes, sir.

36:14.120 --> 36:16.360
Walsh found that there was clear
signs of tampering.

36:16.360 --> 36:18.920
It's the only explanation
for the reactor scramming like that.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.040
Sabotage?

36:24.480 --> 36:27.080
I've spoken to everyone
who was on watch during the scram.

36:27.080 --> 36:29.360
None of the back'afties saw any...
Say no more for now.

36:29.360 --> 36:33.560
We'll have to investigate
without drawing attention. Yes, sir.

36:46.600 --> 36:50.080
What are you doing here? I was going
to ask you the same question.

36:50.080 --> 36:53.200
I came to see the Captain,
instead I find a rating outside,
guarding the door.

36:53.200 --> 36:55.840
I've been confined to quarters.

36:55.840 --> 36:56.960
Again.

36:58.720 --> 37:01.400
Unlike you. Right.

37:02.680 --> 37:03.720
Hm.

37:05.080 --> 37:08.680
Look...the Captain
definitely has his faults,

37:08.680 --> 37:11.360
but he also has to make
some very difficult choices

37:11.360 --> 37:15.840
and this is a...demanding job.

37:15.840 --> 37:18.720
I'm not sure I trust him.
Oh, I think you can.

37:19.800 --> 37:23.040
I appreciate that's a little bit
rich coming from me but... No.

37:23.040 --> 37:26.080
Cos I know which lies you told
and why you told them, so...

37:28.200 --> 37:31.680
As it stands, you're the only person
on this boat that I do trust.

37:33.160 --> 37:34.240
Hm.

37:38.920 --> 37:40.080
Right.

37:44.920 --> 37:47.920
Do you know anything about
what happened to Jackie's son?

37:47.920 --> 37:52.800
Oh. Yeah,
that's a horrific situation. Um...

37:52.800 --> 37:55.800
He's in Indonesia,
he's locked up on drugs charges.

37:55.800 --> 37:59.080
Indonesia?
Yeah, and they're very strict.

37:59.080 --> 38:02.160
Long prison sentences,
not a lot anyone can do about it.

38:02.160 --> 38:04.880
They execute drug smugglers.

38:04.880 --> 38:07.440
I think he's got
a ten-year sentence.

38:08.640 --> 38:12.880
He's getting out.
She found out this morning.

38:12.880 --> 38:16.240
I just...
I thought she seemed a bit odd.

38:16.240 --> 38:19.640
Well, I'm sure it's not something
she's massively proud of. Mm.

38:19.640 --> 38:24.440
How long's he been in?
Not sure. Maybe a year?

38:24.440 --> 38:27.760
So he was in the process
of an appeal?

38:27.760 --> 38:30.240
Yeah. Yeah, I believe so.
I think he appealed last year

38:30.240 --> 38:31.880
and he got turned down.

38:31.880 --> 38:34.080
So he's one year
into a ten-year sentence

38:34.080 --> 38:36.840
and he's just getting out,
just like that?

38:36.840 --> 38:39.200
That doesn't make sense.

38:46.480 --> 38:48.280
Secretary of State for Defence,

38:48.280 --> 38:50.440
Detective Chief Superintendent
Robertson,

38:50.440 --> 38:52.360
Detective Sergeant Longacre,

38:52.360 --> 38:55.240
who are going to update you
on their investigation.

38:55.240 --> 38:57.000
Good afternoon.

38:57.000 --> 39:02.040
We've been uncovering a series
of coded messages sent between

39:02.040 --> 39:06.840
Piter Vasiliev, also known as Peter
Ingles, and an unknown associate,

39:06.840 --> 39:12.480
whom we have reason to believe
might be a crewman on board Vigil.

39:12.480 --> 39:16.560
All right.
What evidence do you have?

39:16.560 --> 39:20.600
Their communications stopped the day
before Vigil went out on patrol.

39:20.600 --> 39:23.760
And we've deciphered some encrypted
data that Ingles had hidden

39:23.760 --> 39:25.640
in a series of images.

39:27.760 --> 39:30.240
This is from ERV Services,

39:30.240 --> 39:33.320
the company you use to supply
the ventilation systems

39:33.320 --> 39:37.080
on Trident submarines.
Now, according to them,

39:37.080 --> 39:41.040
a code that we found in one of the
messages refers to the operation

39:41.040 --> 39:43.360
of this bit of kit,

39:43.360 --> 39:45.400
the atmosphere management plant.

39:45.400 --> 39:49.640
I should point out that if anyone
were able to tamper with this,

39:49.640 --> 39:53.720
it would be extremely dangerous
for anyone on board.

39:55.520 --> 39:57.520
So you believe this crewman

39:57.520 --> 40:01.560
is actively engaged
in sabotaging Vigil?

40:03.040 --> 40:07.760
Do the messages give any clue
as to his or her identity?

40:07.760 --> 40:11.480
We're still trying to decode them.
But it could take weeks.

40:11.480 --> 40:14.840
Well, we clearly don't have
that long.

40:14.840 --> 40:17.160
How can we be certain
this is their plan?

40:17.160 --> 40:21.920
There are also two murder victims
who we know are connected.

40:21.920 --> 40:25.000
We don't have the full picture,
but you can see the implication.

40:25.000 --> 40:29.240
They were killed because they
uncovered what the Russians were
planning.

40:29.240 --> 40:31.040
Will you call Vigil back?

40:33.240 --> 40:38.720
I should say that that is not
our official recommendation yet.

40:38.720 --> 40:41.480
The Rear Admiral tells me
we don't have a boat ready

40:41.480 --> 40:45.040
to replace Vigil for another week.

40:45.040 --> 40:49.440
You are asking me to break
the continuous at-sea deterrent.

40:49.440 --> 40:52.440
But given everything
that we've discovered,

40:52.440 --> 40:54.880
it is something
to be considered, no?

40:54.880 --> 40:58.200
This might be exactly
what they want us to do.

40:59.840 --> 41:01.920
Parliament is taking a vote
next week

41:01.920 --> 41:05.880
on whether or not to replace
Britain's nuclear warheads.

41:05.880 --> 41:09.200
What message would it send out if
we were to be without the deterrent

41:09.200 --> 41:11.640
while that vote is happening?

41:11.640 --> 41:15.080
Minister, if something were to
happen to the crew of Vigil,

41:15.080 --> 41:19.240
could you live with knowing
that you knew there was a problem,
and you didn't bring them home?

41:21.640 --> 41:23.480
Well...

41:23.480 --> 41:24.960
..there's a lot to consider.

41:26.640 --> 41:30.200
Thank you. I'll talk to the PM.

41:38.120 --> 41:42.200
First thing? Aye, first thing.
OK, first thing tomorrow.

41:56.120 --> 41:58.920
Shouldn't you be calling it a day?

41:58.920 --> 42:01.160
Three new cases this week.

42:01.160 --> 42:04.960
When was the last time you were home
by nine? There's a lot to do so...

42:07.320 --> 42:08.480
OK.

42:10.440 --> 42:13.320
And I don't like going home.

42:13.320 --> 42:15.600
So at least I feel useful here.

42:17.800 --> 42:19.600
But, look, I could, um...

42:19.600 --> 42:23.520
I could finish up if you wanted
to go for a drink or something.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.560
Come on, then.

43:39.200 --> 43:42.960
Watch, stand to, close quarters.
Watch, stand to, close quarters.

43:48.960 --> 43:51.200
Something must have snagged
the wire.

43:52.840 --> 43:56.560
All communications are down, we need
you on one-deck now. Yes, sir.

44:01.480 --> 44:05.640
Loss of all broadcast.
Loss of all broadcast.

44:51.960 --> 44:56.040
You see the discolouration?
Burke ingested some kind of toxin.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.240
Thank you, Minister, I will.

46:10.920 --> 46:12.200
Sir?

46:16.280 --> 46:19.920
Urgent message for Vigil.
She's to return to port immediately.

46:19.920 --> 46:23.360
Get a response on receipt
of this order. Yes, sir.

46:35.120 --> 46:38.120
The comms wire is going to take
two to three hours to repair.

46:38.120 --> 46:41.240
Till then we won't receive
any messages. Just get it fixed.

46:41.240 --> 46:43.440
Until then, we're on our own.
Aye, sir.

46:46.800 --> 46:49.160
Carry on.
Why are you out of the cabin?

46:49.160 --> 46:50.960
I think I know who poisoned
Craig Burke.

46:50.960 --> 46:53.240
I just found this
in Jackie Hamilton's bunk.

46:53.240 --> 46:54.840
I think it's connected to her son.

46:54.840 --> 46:58.000
He's just been released from drugs
charges in Indonesia. Believe me,

46:58.000 --> 47:00.680
they don't go away overnight.
I need to get this backed up.

47:00.680 --> 47:03.160
We need to speak to her
straight away.

47:03.160 --> 47:05.800
You're just going to have to
trust me on this.

47:09.160 --> 47:11.200
Ship control, full main broadcast.

47:11.200 --> 47:15.280
Petty Officer Jackie Hamilton
to the control room. Immediately.

47:22.040 --> 47:24.760
 Petty Officer Hamilton,
please report to the control room.

47:24.760 --> 47:29.280
Repeat. Petty Officer Hamilton,
please report to the control room.

47:52.320 --> 47:53.440
Hello.

48:22.480 --> 48:26.840
# Took the breath from my open mouth

48:26.840 --> 48:30.120
# Never known how it broke me down

48:30.120 --> 48:33.800
# I went in circles somewhere... #

48:33.800 --> 48:37.720
Don't let anybody tell you that
you don't know how to throw a party.

48:37.720 --> 48:39.600
This is all your fault.

48:39.600 --> 48:41.440
Mine?! No.

48:43.160 --> 48:46.720
# Storing up on your summer glow

48:46.720 --> 48:51.400
# You went in search of someone else

48:54.680 --> 48:59.440
# And I hear your ship is comin' in

49:02.600 --> 49:07.520
# Your tears a sea for me to swim

49:11.040 --> 49:16.040
# And I hear a storm is comin' in

49:19.120 --> 49:25.440
# My dear, is it all
we've ever been? #

49:25.440 --> 49:27.000
What are you doing?

49:29.680 --> 49:31.840
You said you weren't into women.

49:34.880 --> 49:36.200
I like you.

49:37.600 --> 49:39.280
Oh, you like me?

49:43.640 --> 49:47.200
Tell me that when you're sober.
OK.

49:49.720 --> 49:50.920
I will.

49:50.920 --> 49:54.960
I mean, I'll have a headache
but I'll...still feel the same.

50:00.880 --> 50:05.120
# They taught the hand
that taut the bride

50:05.120 --> 50:08.800
# Both our eyes locked to the tide

50:08.800 --> 50:13.200
# We went in circles somewhere else

50:16.960 --> 50:21.280
# And I hear your ship
is comin' in... #

50:29.400 --> 50:30.680
Boss.

50:30.680 --> 50:33.600
They've sent a message
to Vigil to come back.

50:33.600 --> 50:35.040
That's great.

50:36.360 --> 50:38.280
That was an hour ago.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.360
Boss?
They haven't had a response.

50:46.560 --> 50:48.200
They should've by now.

50:49.560 --> 50:51.200
What does that mean?

50:53.480 --> 50:55.320
Boss? What does that mean?

50:57.400 --> 51:00.600
We are in the shipping lanes.
We keep a wide berth of anything

51:00.600 --> 51:03.120
that might snag the comms wire,
you know that. Yes, sir.

51:03.120 --> 51:05.240
Sir, it was their bearing
and the sea surface.

51:05.240 --> 51:08.120
We didn't hear... You sharpen up.
I'm sorry, sir.

51:08.120 --> 51:10.560
Look, it's been five minutes,
I should go and look for her.

51:10.560 --> 51:13.640
Bring her to the wardroom when you
find her. For the last time...

51:13.640 --> 51:15.000
..focus.

51:21.040 --> 51:24.760
Have you seen Jackie?
Eh, no, but I think the Cox'n
went to look for her.

52:12.840 --> 52:14.160
Oh, God.
