You are not leaving
this table until you

00:03.252 --> 00:04.716
eat all of your
broccoli, young lady.

00:05.320 --> 00:07.288
Great. I've become my mother.

00:07.322 --> 00:09.056
Please, Emma, do it for Daddy.

00:12.528 --> 00:15.430
Okay, how 'bout just this one piece?

00:17.433 --> 00:19.300
Oh! Don't you give me those eyes.

00:19.334 --> 00:21.536
I invented those eyes.

00:25.340 --> 00:28.042
We can do this all night, sister. Okay?

00:28.077 --> 00:30.078
You're not leaving this table
until that plate is clean.

00:35.551 --> 00:37.719
Well played, Emma. Well played.

00:50.933 --> 00:52.534
(dings)

00:52.568 --> 00:56.237
Well, pretty sure you're the first
guy to pass out in a Lamaze class.

00:56.272 --> 00:58.173
You know, it's comforting to
know that during the birth,

00:58.207 --> 01:00.008
you'll be right there by my side...

01:00.042 --> 01:01.432
unconscious.

01:01.911 --> 01:03.996
I'm sorry, but nobody
told me we were

01:04.022 --> 01:06.081
gonna see a video
of an actual birth.

01:06.115 --> 01:08.016
God, I hope I never see that again!

01:09.652 --> 01:10.752
Maybe nobody noticed.

01:10.786 --> 01:12.587
Ha! Yeah, well, if they
didn't hear you snoring,

01:12.622 --> 01:13.688
they definitely heard you giggle

01:13.723 --> 01:14.856
every time the instructor said

01:14.890 --> 01:17.192
- "vagina."
- (Giggles)

01:18.995 --> 01:21.396
Well, of course, I
thought you said "yogurt."

01:21.430 --> 01:24.332
I mean, why would I want to get
all sweaty and bendy with you?

01:25.835 --> 01:27.736
Oh, whoa!

01:27.770 --> 01:29.704
Is it just me or are you twice as big

01:29.739 --> 01:30.872
as the last time I saw you?

01:32.475 --> 01:34.242
Well, I just came by
to make you an offer

01:34.276 --> 01:35.744
you can't refuse.

01:35.778 --> 01:37.278
So, it turns out that Brad and I

01:37.313 --> 01:38.580
can't take that cruise we booked,

01:38.614 --> 01:41.016
because one of us committed a felony,

01:41.050 --> 01:42.217
and is in jail.

01:43.419 --> 01:46.021
My money was so on you in that scenario.

01:47.156 --> 01:48.957
Well, the tickets are nonrefundable,

01:48.991 --> 01:50.291
so, I thought you might like to go.

01:50.326 --> 01:52.627
Oh my God, really? A cruise?

01:52.662 --> 01:53.928
I've... I've
never been on one.

01:53.963 --> 01:56.131
- Mrs. Wheeler that's so amaze...
- Okay, shh.

01:57.900 --> 02:00.101
Not you and Danny.

02:00.136 --> 02:02.404
Me and Danny, okay?

02:02.438 --> 02:05.774
I mean, do you really want to
be seen in a bikini right now?

02:05.808 --> 02:08.076
Me thinks not.

02:08.110 --> 02:12.113
Plus, I thought it would be a
really fun mother/son bonding trip.

02:12.148 --> 02:14.983
I mean, somebody never lets
us have any fun anymore.

02:18.087 --> 02:20.822
Oh, man, wow!

02:20.856 --> 02:22.791
Just wow, but...

02:22.825 --> 02:24.526
I don't know, Mom. I mean,

02:24.560 --> 02:26.795
we've been pretty busy with
these Lablahzery classes.

02:28.497 --> 02:30.532
Ah, Lamaze.

02:30.566 --> 02:32.200
The poor man's epidural.

02:35.037 --> 02:37.038
Yeah, but they're super
important to Riley.

02:37.073 --> 02:39.353
Oh, oh, you know, we're
good. It was a special.

02:39.408 --> 02:42.477
One and done. We are 100%
ready to have this baby.

02:42.511 --> 02:44.369
Hey, Tucker, can I talk
to you for a second?

02:44.614 --> 02:46.748
I mean, I doubt it.
You're pretty long-winded.

02:48.217 --> 02:51.620
Danny, this cruise is
gonna be so much fun!

02:51.654 --> 02:53.622
You know, I took a Lamaze class once.

02:53.656 --> 02:55.290
I got thrown out for giggling every time

02:55.324 --> 02:57.459
the instructor said "vagina."

02:57.493 --> 02:58.593
(both laughing)

03:00.713 --> 03:02.214
(rhythmic breathing)

03:04.717 --> 03:06.952
Man, I thought you said there
would be hot chicks here.

03:06.986 --> 03:08.287
There are.

03:08.321 --> 03:09.988
They're just pregnant.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.523
(chimes)

03:13.159 --> 03:15.027
(grunts) Yeah.

03:17.330 --> 03:19.988
Oh my God. Oh my God! My ex-girlfriend
from high school's over there!

03:20.088 --> 03:21.431
Crap! She can't see me like this.

03:21.531 --> 03:23.565
She dumped me so hard in the
middle of cheerleading practice.

03:23.599 --> 03:24.800
Wow, that must've been awkward.

03:24.834 --> 03:27.502
Yeah! Considering I was on
top of the pyramid at the time.

03:28.838 --> 03:31.440
I have been planning my
revenge moment for years.

03:31.474 --> 03:32.989
I mean, I'm supposed to
be living large right now!

03:33.089 --> 03:34.590
Not sitting on an
old, smelly pillow

03:34.616 --> 03:36.116
at the Y with my
fat, sweaty friend.

03:37.227 --> 03:38.327
I'm pregnant.

03:38.361 --> 03:40.062
Yeah, that's what I
said. Fat and sweaty.

03:41.498 --> 03:42.665
Tucker?

03:42.699 --> 03:44.066
Tucker Dobbs, is that really you?

03:44.100 --> 03:45.768
Adrienne? Adrienne!

03:45.802 --> 03:48.304
Wow! What a...
What a small world!

03:48.338 --> 03:49.471
What... What are
you doing here?

03:49.506 --> 03:51.628
I'm guessing the same
as you. Having a baby!

03:51.728 --> 03:53.162
Oh, you must be Tucker's wife!

03:53.197 --> 03:54.530
- Oh, we're not...
- Into bragging.

03:54.565 --> 03:56.432
But! But this is...

03:56.467 --> 03:59.602
This is my smart, beautiful,
lawyer wife, Riley.

03:59.636 --> 04:01.737
(chuckles) She's a lawyer.

04:01.772 --> 04:03.673
She used to be a swimsuit
model before she got fat.

04:05.676 --> 04:08.811
Wow! Wow, and look at you
with... with the husband.

04:08.846 --> 04:11.535
Oh, crazy, right? This is my Joe.

04:11.635 --> 04:13.469
Joe, this is my old friend
from high school, Tucker.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.304
Kinda more than a friend.

04:15.339 --> 04:17.839
Oh! Were you that cheerleader dude?

04:20.110 --> 04:21.510
Okay.

04:22.980 --> 04:25.348
Well, great catching up, right?

04:25.382 --> 04:26.853
Oh, what's the rush?

04:27.318 --> 04:28.918
You know, we should have lunch,

04:28.952 --> 04:30.186
the four of us.

04:30.220 --> 04:31.788
I know we're free right now.

04:31.822 --> 04:34.724
Uh, yeah, if it's
not awkward, or any...

04:34.758 --> 04:36.835
Oh, no, that's okay. I love awkward.

04:37.695 --> 04:39.195
Awkward can be fun.

04:41.999 --> 04:44.367
What do you mean Mom is sending
you and Riley on a cruise?

04:44.402 --> 04:46.336
Why would she do that? What's the catch?

04:46.370 --> 04:48.438
No catch. She just
thought with the baby...

04:48.472 --> 04:51.318
Hey, I've had a kid for over three
years, and what's she ever given me?

04:52.910 --> 04:55.424
Well, actually, she has been
kind of invaluable with Emma.

04:55.524 --> 04:56.991
But that's no cruise!

04:57.693 --> 04:59.475
What up, sons of bitches?

05:00.031 --> 05:02.900
That's right, I just
called myself a bitch.

05:02.934 --> 05:06.070
You know why? Because
I embrace my flaws.

05:06.104 --> 05:08.939
You see, boys, life is
about confidence, courage.

05:08.974 --> 05:10.874
And you know what gives me courage?

05:10.909 --> 05:12.743
Booze, you got any?

05:12.777 --> 05:14.445
No, and I'm glad you're here.

05:14.479 --> 05:16.280
Let's talk about Mexico, shall we?

05:16.314 --> 05:18.816
Okay, I'll go first. I like it!

05:20.151 --> 05:21.119
I can't believe you only thought about

05:21.219 --> 05:22.058
Danny for this vacation.

05:22.158 --> 05:23.758
I should get to go on a cruise, too.

05:23.793 --> 05:25.227
Well, you know, to be honest, sweetie,

05:25.261 --> 05:26.661
I didn't think you'd be interested.

05:26.696 --> 05:27.696
Why not?

05:27.730 --> 05:29.865
I tan well, I look great in shorts,

05:29.899 --> 05:32.067
and quite frankly, I've always
wanted to order a pink drink

05:32.101 --> 05:33.192
without feeling ashamed.

05:34.136 --> 05:35.591
Well, Ben, all you had to do was ask

05:35.691 --> 05:38.192
if you wanted to spend some
alone time with your mom.

05:41.897 --> 05:45.366
I-I-I'm sorry. Did you just
say "alone time" with you?

05:46.869 --> 05:49.937
I cannot believe that both my boys

05:49.972 --> 05:52.090
want to spend a whole week with me.

05:52.641 --> 05:55.543
And to think, I almost gave
one of you up for adoption.

05:59.849 --> 06:01.783
You know what, I'm being selfish.

06:01.817 --> 06:03.651
You asked Danny first.
He should go with you.

06:03.686 --> 06:05.058
Oh, no, no, no, that's okay, dude.

06:05.158 --> 06:06.826
You deserve a rest. You should go.

06:06.860 --> 06:08.794
No, no, no, you should go. I insist.

06:08.829 --> 06:10.907
Oh, but you look so good in shorts.

06:11.765 --> 06:15.368
All right, you two kids fight it
out amongst yourselves and decide.

06:15.402 --> 06:18.070
I am going to the drugstore
to get some Band-Aids.

06:18.105 --> 06:20.473
I don't want my nipples to get sunburnt.

06:24.178 --> 06:25.244
(door closes)

06:26.013 --> 06:27.247
You tricked me!

06:27.281 --> 06:29.172
Not as dumb as I think, huh?

06:30.855 --> 06:32.722
Don't you mean, "Not
as dumb as you think?"

06:32.757 --> 06:34.924
No, that doesn't make sense at all.

06:36.394 --> 06:38.628
Fine, whatever. You have declared war,

06:38.662 --> 06:41.698
so we shall settle this the
way all Wheeler gentlemen do.

06:41.732 --> 06:44.187
We go to battle. Loser goes with Mom.

06:44.202 --> 06:46.836
I'm in, but what are we gonna play?

06:46.871 --> 06:49.105
The customary challenge
would be Slaughter Ball,

06:49.140 --> 06:52.022
but local laws have now made it
illegal in the tri-state area.

06:52.910 --> 06:55.469
Might I suggest a civilized
game of Donkey Tail?

06:55.569 --> 06:58.037
Hmm, I'll allow it.

06:58.071 --> 07:00.105
But the ceremonial tail's been missing

07:00.140 --> 07:01.574
since the great fire of '07.

07:01.608 --> 07:03.342
Oh, has it?

07:03.376 --> 07:05.277
Who's the ass? You're the ass!

07:06.446 --> 07:07.580
Get back here!

07:09.983 --> 07:11.884
And that is how I ended up

07:11.919 --> 07:14.954
the executive producer
of a hit talk show.

07:14.988 --> 07:17.252
Did I mention I won a New
York Entertainment Award?

07:17.324 --> 07:19.659
Shockingly, no.

07:19.693 --> 07:21.694
I won a New York Entertainment Award.

07:21.728 --> 07:23.279
- That's great, Tucker.
- Yeah.

07:23.379 --> 07:25.413
You did really well for yourself.

07:25.448 --> 07:27.449
You know, since we're bragging.

07:27.483 --> 07:29.017
- Was I bragging?
- A little.

07:30.319 --> 07:32.724
I was just voted Graphic
Designer of the Year.

07:33.156 --> 07:35.624
Wow! That is really impressive.

07:35.658 --> 07:38.193
Both real and impressive,
isn't it, Tucker?

07:38.228 --> 07:40.095
I mean, it's all right.

07:40.130 --> 07:42.271
I... I was gonna keep
this is a secret, but...

07:42.799 --> 07:45.467
- I own this bar!
- (Coughing)

07:45.502 --> 07:48.123
Right? I mean, sometimes you just
gotta burn off all that cash, right?

07:48.538 --> 07:50.005
Man, it's tough being rich!

07:51.608 --> 07:53.209
- Money can't buy everything.
- No.

07:53.243 --> 07:54.338
Like the truth.

07:54.611 --> 07:56.512
Or silence, okay?

07:56.547 --> 07:57.914
Well... Well, this
has been great.

07:57.948 --> 07:59.849
And it's been great seeing you.

07:59.883 --> 08:02.418
Be sure to tell the old
gang how amazing I'm doing.

08:02.452 --> 08:04.860
Yeah, hey, hey, why make
this a one-time thing?

08:04.960 --> 08:06.861
We'd love a new couple friend.

08:06.896 --> 08:08.396
- Dinner tomorrow night?
- Seriously?

08:08.431 --> 08:11.032
- We're actually...
- Totally available.

08:11.067 --> 08:13.034
Come on, what do you say? Same place?

08:13.069 --> 08:15.036
I mean, you do own the joint.

08:15.071 --> 08:17.672
I do, all right.

08:17.707 --> 08:18.840
- Yeah, all right.
- See ya.

08:18.874 --> 08:20.508
(muttering) Really
lookin' forward to it.

08:21.677 --> 08:23.945
- Why didn't you stop him?
- I don't know! I panicked!

08:23.980 --> 08:25.714
You're the one who suggested lunch.

08:25.748 --> 08:27.416
Yeah, 'cause I thought
it would be hilarious

08:27.450 --> 08:29.018
to see you squirm in front of your ex.

08:29.118 --> 08:31.091
Not because I wanted to be
dragged into some weird production

08:31.191 --> 08:33.793
<i>of Tucker Dobbs' Sad
Little House of Lies.</i>

08:33.827 --> 08:35.794
It's a terrible play.

08:35.828 --> 08:37.863
Riley, come on!

08:40.232 --> 08:41.267
(yelps)

08:41.301 --> 08:44.070
Don't do that! I thought you were Danny!

08:44.104 --> 08:45.705
You didn't see me.

08:47.000 --> 08:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:54.014 --> 08:55.581
I'm hiding from Danny!
I'm hiding from Danny!

08:55.616 --> 08:56.849
Hiding from Danny. Hiding from Danny.

08:56.884 --> 08:58.551
Hiding from Danny.
Hiding from Danny, hiding.

09:01.855 --> 09:03.656
Well, I guess I'm done babysitting.

09:05.159 --> 09:06.626
Hello!

09:09.563 --> 09:11.256
All right, hey! What do you say...

09:11.332 --> 09:12.699
we camp out in Daddy's room tonight,

09:12.733 --> 09:14.801
that way we won't run into
Uncle Donkey. It'll be fun!

09:14.835 --> 09:16.269
- (thuds)
- (Screams)

09:16.303 --> 09:18.405
(grunts) I'm comin' for ya, little bro!

09:18.439 --> 09:20.273
Camping trip canceled!

09:20.307 --> 09:21.708
Running from Danny!

09:21.742 --> 09:23.710
Running from Danny! Running
from Danny! Running from Danny!

09:23.744 --> 09:25.145
Running from Danny! Here.

09:25.245 --> 09:27.480
Talk to you later, Flaskie. Hey.

09:27.514 --> 09:29.682
(screams)

09:29.716 --> 09:30.950
(shouts)

09:32.285 --> 09:34.153
- You're an ass!
- No, you're an ass!

09:36.890 --> 09:38.224
- (shouts)
- (Whimpers)

09:41.395 --> 09:43.062
You're an ass!

09:47.034 --> 09:48.468
Ben: Still the ass!

09:53.775 --> 09:54.941
Aw.

09:54.976 --> 09:58.178
Your dad has never lost
a game of Donkey Tail.

09:59.347 --> 10:01.378
That's probably not the
proud moment I think it is.

10:01.478 --> 10:03.579
Gimme a minute, and I'll
come up with something else.

10:05.983 --> 10:08.135
I still can't believe you lost
the Donkey Tail in the subway.

10:08.235 --> 10:10.603
They called me "Donkey Boy," Ben.

10:10.638 --> 10:12.439
You know I don't do
well with name-calling!

10:13.774 --> 10:16.042
We need a new game.
How 'bout Dart Dodge?

10:16.077 --> 10:18.211
No! I still have a hole behind my ear.

10:18.245 --> 10:19.713
Bottle Drop?

10:19.747 --> 10:21.636
No, I still have a
slight limp when it rains.

10:22.450 --> 10:23.784
(whistle trills)

10:23.818 --> 10:25.152
Flag on the play!

10:25.186 --> 10:27.321
I am officially changing the game,

10:27.355 --> 10:29.523
since you two knuckleheads
can't settle it,

10:29.557 --> 10:32.459
and I know how much you both
want to go away with Mom.

10:32.493 --> 10:34.260
We do, Mom, we really do.

10:34.360 --> 10:35.894
Yeah, Mom, we're dying to go.

10:35.928 --> 10:37.262
Dying.

10:37.296 --> 10:39.397
Well, then, it's a good thing I came up

10:39.432 --> 10:42.091
with a little something
I like to call "Truth...

10:42.191 --> 10:44.593
or Mom-sequences."

10:44.627 --> 10:47.062
Let's see who knows me best!

10:47.096 --> 10:49.531
- Oh, crap!
- Oh, I so got this!

10:49.565 --> 10:52.314
All right, Ben, you honk the
horn if you know the answer.

10:52.414 --> 10:53.914
Danny, hit the bell.

10:53.949 --> 10:55.916
- (dings)
- When you know the answer.

10:55.951 --> 10:57.051
(dings)

10:57.085 --> 10:58.448
I didn't ask a question yet.

10:58.548 --> 10:59.548
- Got it.
- (Dings)

10:59.582 --> 11:00.816
Okay, this...

11:03.086 --> 11:04.186
All right, here we go.

11:05.288 --> 11:06.455
What's my favorite...

11:06.490 --> 11:07.556
- (honks horn)
- Chardonnay!

11:07.591 --> 11:08.515
When did I go to jail?

11:08.615 --> 11:10.449
- (honks horn)
- '92, '96 and 2012.

11:10.483 --> 11:11.817
Where did your dad
and I conceive...

11:11.851 --> 11:13.752
- (honks horn)
- Back seat of the Pinto, you were 17.

11:13.786 --> 11:15.703
- And wearing?
- A full leg cast!

11:15.722 --> 11:17.122
Where is
Aunt Sylvia...

11:17.157 --> 11:18.624
Buried under the bridge
by the East River.

11:18.658 --> 11:19.858
How many aliases?

11:19.893 --> 11:22.361
Three aliases! Uh, Brenda
Wong, Barbara Wachowski,

11:22.395 --> 11:23.737
and, for some reason, Bruce Winston.

11:23.797 --> 11:25.698
- Who are my...
- Archenemies!

11:25.732 --> 11:27.800
Tonya, the Schwarma Guy, and Nana Lyle.

11:27.834 --> 11:30.169
- Who is my favorite...
- Danny! All day, every day!

11:30.203 --> 11:32.972
Yes! In a surprise twist, Benji wins!

11:33.006 --> 11:35.074
Yes, I did it! Ha!

11:36.777 --> 11:38.163
I don't have to go on that stupid cruise

11:38.263 --> 11:40.698
to stupid Mexico with
stupid Mom, you do!

11:42.902 --> 11:44.202
Oh, crap.

11:45.271 --> 11:47.305
Hey, Mom, I didn't mean it...

11:48.641 --> 11:50.842
Mom, come on, I was just joking!

11:53.145 --> 11:54.179
- (door closes)
- Uh-oh.

11:54.447 --> 11:56.915
No slam, you know what that means.

11:56.949 --> 11:58.635
It's gonna be a very long night.

12:03.590 --> 12:05.958
How do you know so
much about Mom anyway?

12:05.992 --> 12:08.193
How do you not? She never shuts up.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.930
Oh! Hey, Riley. Wow.

12:17.003 --> 12:19.705
You know what? You really
do have that pregnancy glow.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.170
Aw, really?

12:21.341 --> 12:24.210
'Cause you have that
fake compliment glow.

12:24.244 --> 12:27.438
I am not going to dinner with you
and your incredibly amazing ex, okay?

12:27.538 --> 12:30.107
I'm a lawyer. I have to
lie every day at work.

12:30.141 --> 12:31.953
I don't want to have to
do it in my real life.

12:32.744 --> 12:34.635
Come on, please!

12:34.712 --> 12:36.580
Look, if she finds out
I made everything up,

12:36.614 --> 12:38.441
she'll tell everyone from high school.

12:38.450 --> 12:41.051
And once again, I'll
be Dorky Doody Dobbs.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.788
You'll always be Dorky
Doody Dobbs to me.

12:46.658 --> 12:47.892
Fine.

12:47.926 --> 12:51.451
I'll, um, I'll just tell Danny
you took me to Lamaze class.

12:51.663 --> 12:53.331
Oh, you wouldn't dare.

12:53.365 --> 12:54.799
Oh, I dare.

12:56.268 --> 12:58.035
- Danny!
- No.

12:58.070 --> 12:58.960
Danny, I need
to talk to you...

12:58.986 --> 13:00.208
Tucker and I are
having dinner tonight.

13:00.539 --> 13:01.939
That's what I thought.

13:03.208 --> 13:06.241
Hey, uh, do you want to come
have second breakfast with me?

13:06.545 --> 13:08.546
No can do. Can't leave the couch.

13:08.581 --> 13:10.115
Mom locked herself in Ben's room,

13:10.149 --> 13:11.516
and the first one to leave the couch

13:11.550 --> 13:13.485
will be chastised to
a new level of shame

13:13.519 --> 13:14.853
if she comes out and we're not here.

13:16.322 --> 13:18.008
A simple "no" would have sufficed.

13:22.128 --> 13:24.997
It's clearly a gorilla petting a cat.

13:26.332 --> 13:29.101
Dude, please, it's obviously
a penguin playing a ukulele.

13:30.570 --> 13:32.229
We should really get
the ceiling painted.

13:33.440 --> 13:35.607
She's never coming out, is she?

13:35.642 --> 13:37.113
We should order more pizza.

13:37.213 --> 13:39.214
And we need to get our stories
straight before she comes out.

13:39.248 --> 13:40.815
- We need to stick together.
- (Door opens)

13:40.850 --> 13:42.215
Oh, hey Mom! Remember
when I knew all

13:42.241 --> 13:43.245
that stuff about you
that Danny didn't?

13:43.345 --> 13:44.284
I love you!

13:45.955 --> 13:49.157
You know, I can't
believe I wasted my youth

13:49.191 --> 13:51.059
raising the two most ungrateful,

13:51.093 --> 13:53.819
mean, sorry excuses for sons
this world has ever seen.

13:53.996 --> 13:55.124
Would it have been that traumatic

13:55.224 --> 13:57.058
to spend some time
alone with your mother?

13:57.092 --> 13:59.555
The one person, who spent
her life trying to make sure

13:59.655 --> 14:01.857
that you got to be a
professional hockey player,

14:01.891 --> 14:05.160
and you... the proud brother
of a professional hockey player.

14:06.462 --> 14:08.278
I have never been this disappointed

14:08.378 --> 14:09.812
in my own flesh and
blood, and, trust me,

14:09.846 --> 14:12.677
I have had a lifetime of
disappointment from you both.

14:13.817 --> 14:15.051
Mom, we're so sorry.

14:15.085 --> 14:17.053
No, no, he's not, but I am, Mom.

14:17.087 --> 14:18.762
I really am. I want to go
on that cruise with you.

14:18.889 --> 14:21.057
Yeah, well, I'm sorrier,
so I should go with you.

14:21.091 --> 14:22.200
No way! I'm going!

14:22.300 --> 14:23.367
Screw you! I'm going!

14:23.401 --> 14:25.002
What makes you think
she wants to go with you?

14:25.036 --> 14:26.537
Because we never spend
any time together!

14:26.571 --> 14:28.339
(arguing continues indistinctly)

14:28.373 --> 14:30.441
And I'm back to being fought over.

14:30.475 --> 14:31.942
Order restored.

14:37.193 --> 14:39.694
Look... all you have to do
is sit through one dinner,

14:39.728 --> 14:41.262
and when they call for another date,

14:41.297 --> 14:43.331
I will tell them I dumped you.

14:43.365 --> 14:45.266
Or better yet, you died.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.035
And you can waddle
off into the distance.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.171
Totally fine with that, Doody.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.108
Oh, man, that gift just keeps on giving.

14:54.510 --> 14:56.144
I can't believe you did this to me!

14:56.178 --> 14:58.648
Hey, I thought it'd be funny to
see you squirm in front of your ex.

14:58.748 --> 15:01.650
It wasn't my idea to lie
about being your husband.

15:01.684 --> 15:03.118
Well, I panicked!

15:03.153 --> 15:04.853
I couldn't tell him
you're a broke actor,

15:04.888 --> 15:06.171
and I'm a knocked-up
single woman who

15:06.197 --> 15:07.446
doesn't even know
who the father is.

15:07.521 --> 15:10.256
And now, thanks to you, I have
to tap dance through another meal.

15:10.290 --> 15:13.411
Hey, if they ask us out again?
Feel free to say I dumped you.

15:14.428 --> 15:17.129
I'm going on that cruise with
Mom if it's the last thing I do.

15:17.164 --> 15:18.664
Well, it will be the last thing you do

15:18.699 --> 15:20.499
after the last thing I do to you,

15:20.534 --> 15:22.768
which will render you unable to
do the last thing you wanted to do.

15:22.803 --> 15:25.071
Good one, Danny.

15:25.105 --> 15:27.042
I didn't get it, but
I like your passion.

15:27.541 --> 15:29.475
I'm going with Mom! I won the quiz.

15:29.510 --> 15:30.636
That shouldn't count.

15:30.736 --> 15:32.136
You were trying to
win, so you could lose,

15:32.170 --> 15:33.236
now we're trying to win, so we can win!

15:33.336 --> 15:35.270
Ooh, you know, that one, I actually got.

15:35.305 --> 15:36.855
Good job, Danny!

15:37.107 --> 15:40.009
You know, just once, I wish you'd
say, "Good job, Danny" to me.

15:40.043 --> 15:42.678
Just try to come up with a
real competition I can't win.

15:42.712 --> 15:44.280
Hey, can I vodka soda with a twist?

15:44.314 --> 15:45.914
Yeah, sure thing.

15:49.653 --> 15:50.953
Boom!

15:50.987 --> 15:53.355
Bartending. Now that, I can crush.

15:53.390 --> 15:54.690
What... No, that's
not even fair.

15:54.724 --> 15:56.615
Then back out now, and
let me go on the cruise.

15:56.693 --> 15:58.195
Oh, no. It's on!

15:58.295 --> 16:00.529
Whoever gets the most tips at
the end of a half an hour, wins.

16:00.564 --> 16:01.717
Done.

16:01.865 --> 16:04.100
And I will stay
impartial by not tipping.

16:04.134 --> 16:05.335
Both: You never tip!

16:06.704 --> 16:09.272
(women cheering)

16:19.450 --> 16:20.750
- (women cheer)
- (Clatters)

16:22.987 --> 16:25.088
(women cheering loudly)

16:25.122 --> 16:26.790
Time! Danny wins!

16:26.824 --> 16:28.091
Damn it!

16:28.125 --> 16:30.390
You are going on that cruise!

16:30.728 --> 16:32.380
Okay, well, I'm gonna go
home and start planning

16:32.480 --> 16:34.414
some fun couple things to do in Mexico.

16:34.448 --> 16:37.050
Matching tats, mother/son massages, oh!

16:37.084 --> 16:38.743
Oh, and by the way, I just heard.

16:38.843 --> 16:39.869
We have to share a king.

16:39.969 --> 16:41.203
You're cool with that, right?

16:41.237 --> 16:42.771
(excited squeals)

16:44.241 --> 16:46.809
Ha! You thought you had it
in the bag, didn't you, bro?

16:46.843 --> 16:48.077
Yep. I'm crushed.

16:48.111 --> 16:50.379
Totally blindsided. Have
a great time with Mom.

16:50.414 --> 16:52.581
Wait. You threw the competition?

16:52.616 --> 16:54.350
I didn't even have to!

16:54.384 --> 16:55.551
I knew that shirt was coming off,

16:55.585 --> 16:56.756
like, two seconds in.

16:56.887 --> 16:58.754
Man, you can be such a basic bitch.

16:59.823 --> 17:02.058
Wait, so you didn't ever
want to go away with Mom?

17:02.092 --> 17:04.627
I did for, like, a second,
but then I remembered,

17:04.661 --> 17:05.928
"Oh, yeah, it's Mom."

17:05.963 --> 17:07.798
But... But that's cheating!
I didn't want to go either!

17:07.897 --> 17:10.066
Well, you should've thought of
that before your whole strip show.

17:10.099 --> 17:11.913
No! No, no, no, no, no.

17:12.002 --> 17:14.404
Page three of the Wheeler
War Family Guide Book

17:14.438 --> 17:17.006
clearly states, deceptive
rules are strictly forbidden.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.040
We're still in this.

17:18.075 --> 17:19.603
Damn it, I wrote that
book to confuse you.

17:19.703 --> 17:21.671
I didn't think you'd actually read it.

17:21.704 --> 17:23.045
Fine, whatever, your pick.

17:23.140 --> 17:25.007
Loser goes with Mom, and
there's no way I'm losing.

17:25.041 --> 17:25.980
What's it gonna be?

17:26.009 --> 17:27.844
Oh... I dunno.

17:27.877 --> 17:29.379
- Five Minute Tag, you're it!
- Damn!

17:30.748 --> 17:32.181
What was that all about?

17:32.216 --> 17:34.917
No idea. (clears throat)

17:34.952 --> 17:36.052
Well, this was fun, right?

17:36.152 --> 17:37.919
Let... Let's do this
again sometime, yeah?

17:37.953 --> 17:39.721
We haven't even ordered yet.

17:39.755 --> 17:41.020
The service here sucks.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.521
Actually, so does the food.

17:42.555 --> 17:43.755
Isn't this your bar?

17:45.191 --> 17:46.324
It is.

17:46.359 --> 17:49.194
- You're fired.
- (Scoffing)

17:51.130 --> 17:52.564
You know, Tucker,

17:52.598 --> 17:55.364
it is so interesting how
you managed to open up a bar,

17:55.464 --> 17:57.932
become an executive
producer of a hit TV show,

17:57.967 --> 18:00.356
and still be a reserve
for the Navy SEALs.

18:00.803 --> 18:03.538
Tell me again how you
made all... that happen.

18:06.042 --> 18:07.609
Well, I...

18:07.643 --> 18:10.979
I... I couldn't do it without
the help of my beautiful wife.

18:12.115 --> 18:13.715
Help, beautiful wife.

18:14.751 --> 18:16.652
- (both muttering)
- Girl, you better help me.

18:16.686 --> 18:18.087
- Are you serious?
- Come on, please help me.

18:18.121 --> 18:19.621
- I'm not helping.
- You better help me.

18:23.460 --> 18:24.044
Oh my gosh, I...

18:24.144 --> 18:25.911
I can't believe that
thing's happening over there!

18:27.547 --> 18:29.949
(shrieks) Oh no! My water just broke!

18:29.983 --> 18:31.584
I think the baby is coming!

18:31.618 --> 18:33.252
- Really? Now?
- Uh-huh.

18:33.286 --> 18:34.587
Yes! Yes, it is!

18:34.621 --> 18:36.022
The... the baby is
coming, so... so,

18:36.056 --> 18:37.590
so, we will obviously have to go.

18:37.624 --> 18:39.094
Talk soon... or not.

18:39.259 --> 18:40.973
Everybody stand back,
she's having a baby!

18:41.061 --> 18:42.862
Wait. You're having our baby now?

18:42.896 --> 18:44.397
- Danny, hey!
- His baby?

18:44.431 --> 18:46.143
Oh, we got to get you to the hospital!

18:46.233 --> 18:48.367
- You're it!
- Aw, dang it!

18:48.402 --> 18:51.102
Boom. Game over. I win. You lose.

18:51.202 --> 18:53.370
You have to go on the cruise. Ha!

18:54.505 --> 18:55.772
Drinks on me.

18:57.041 --> 18:58.942
Well, just you two. Let's not get crazy!

19:00.545 --> 19:02.346
Tucker, what the hell is going on here?

19:02.380 --> 19:04.247
Oh, I-I'll tell you
what's going on here.

19:04.282 --> 19:06.249
He's a bigger liar than you are.

19:06.284 --> 19:08.254
No, I can explain...
Wait. What?

19:08.586 --> 19:09.987
What... What did
you lie about?

19:11.856 --> 19:14.191
Everything. I'm not her husband.

19:14.225 --> 19:16.186
She doesn't even know who
the father of the baby is,

19:16.286 --> 19:18.054
and I'm just trying to
hook up with her sister.

19:19.223 --> 19:20.890
Is that true?

19:20.924 --> 19:22.625
Yeah, my sister's really hot.

19:22.793 --> 19:25.962
No... look, why did you lie?

19:28.866 --> 19:31.834
Because I'm a... pregnant, single girl

19:31.869 --> 19:33.665
who saw her ex-boyfriend and panicked.

19:34.004 --> 19:35.182
I mean, now that I know
that you're just as

19:35.282 --> 19:37.440
much of a loser when
it comes to love...

19:37.475 --> 19:40.009
maybe there's a reason
we found each other again.

19:40.044 --> 19:41.911
Maybe we could give it another shot.

19:43.981 --> 19:45.014
Wow.

19:46.250 --> 19:47.951
That is really messed up.

19:49.487 --> 19:50.887
That guy is our "manny,"

19:50.921 --> 19:53.323
and was hired for just
this type of emergency.

19:53.357 --> 19:55.258
Riley and I are very much in love,

19:55.292 --> 19:56.626
and very happily married.

19:56.660 --> 19:57.927
Now, if you will excuse me,

19:57.962 --> 20:00.130
I need to go witness the
birth of my first child.

20:01.532 --> 20:03.867
Honestly, Adrienne, I...

20:03.901 --> 20:05.201
I can't believe you.

20:06.804 --> 20:08.838
I just can't... I just
can't believe you.

20:13.010 --> 20:14.292
Sound the chimes!

20:14.392 --> 20:17.194
This Bonnie voyage is about to take off.

20:17.228 --> 20:18.562
No need to rub it in, Mom.

20:18.596 --> 20:20.897
I'm already super depressed
I can't go with you.

20:20.932 --> 20:22.766
Super depressed. This is all an act.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.501
I'm actually crying on the inside.

20:24.535 --> 20:28.138
Well, actually, Benji, I felt
so terrible about what happened

20:28.172 --> 20:30.974
that I gave both tickets
to Danny and Riley.

20:31.009 --> 20:32.676
I'm gonna spend the week here.

20:32.710 --> 20:33.944
With you.

20:33.978 --> 20:34.978
Uh-oh.

20:36.881 --> 20:38.682
Oh! Oh, look at this.

20:38.716 --> 20:42.285
Look at how happy I made your daddy!

20:42.320 --> 20:44.654
Oh, he's crying with joy!

20:44.689 --> 20:46.423
- No, I'm not!
- Yes, you are.

20:46.457 --> 20:47.991
It is joy.
