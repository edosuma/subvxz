10:03.400 --> 10:05.500
It was never really the same after.

10:08.300 --> 10:09.240
How do you mean?

10:09.260 --> 10:13.580
They never smiled again,either of them,ever.

10:15.370 --> 10:17.090
Who's that?

10:18.580 --> 10:20.320
It's my grandfather.

10:20.340 --> 10:23.300
He held a party job in the former government.

10:23.560 --> 10:26.070
When communism fell,he was arrested.

10:27.640 --> 10:30.600
Arrested?He was a criminal?

10:32.500 --> 10:33.910
In the new russia.

10:33.930 --> 10:36.220
He died a year later in prison.

10:36.240 --> 10:38.790
We were already here for 3 years by then.

10:38.830 --> 10:40.700
We fled in 1988.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.120
You fled?

10:42.600 --> 10:45.030
We were smuggled out in delivery trucks.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.560
My father never really believed,

10:52.580 --> 10:55.810
even with democracy,russia could ever change.

10:55.860 --> 10:57.200
He was right.

10:58.010 --> 10:59.120
What he didn't expect was that

10:59.140 --> 11:02.030
it would allow criminals to follow.

11:06.320 --> 11:09.640
In america,they can only hurt you if you're afraid to ask for help.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.420
Is that really true?

11:14.070 --> 11:15.510
Most of the time.

11:17.090 --> 11:20.010
I hope,for my father's sake this is one of those times.

11:30.060 --> 11:32.800
What are you doing?You'll kill him!

11:33.410 --> 11:35.400
Then he dies.

11:35.500 --> 11:36.630
So What?

11:37.050 --> 11:38.440
I...you...please...

11:38.870 --> 11:39.950
The money.

11:50.410 --> 11:54.480
I am going to love cutting you to pieces...

11:54.890 --> 11:56.710
...old man!

11:57.880 --> 12:00.950
We have no money.

12:02.320 --> 12:04.080
Soon.

12:06.350 --> 12:09.830
It's okey.They will send the money.

12:11.050 --> 12:13.670
We--we--we--we have no money.

12:13.690 --> 12:17.540
They'll send it.They always do.

12:31.780 --> 12:33.420
This all involves the russian mafia.

12:33.440 --> 12:35.940
It's really beefed up around here the last 10 years or so.

12:35.960 --> 12:37.740
Started off mainly new york and L.A.

12:37.760 --> 12:40.000
But they send lieutenants from the old country

12:40.020 --> 12:43.260
pakhans they call them to open branch offices in other cities.

12:43.280 --> 12:44.260
Like baltimore.

12:44.280 --> 12:47.930
St. Louis,chicago,dallas...List goes on.

12:47.970 --> 12:49.860
They're mainly offshoots of the odessa mafia

12:49.880 --> 12:52.670
and they're especially tough to crack from the law enforcement standpoint.

12:52.690 --> 12:56.160
I mean,besides being well organized with sophisticated technical equipment

12:56.180 --> 12:58.610
there's vory v zakone to contend with.

12:58.630 --> 12:59.960
-The thieves code. -Yeah.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.370
18 principles they live by.

13:01.390 --> 13:03.200
It's like a bible to these guys.

13:03.220 --> 13:05.110
Stepping outside of it means certain death.

13:05.130 --> 13:07.990
We're not gonna be turning any of them informer anytime soon.

13:08.010 --> 13:09.610
Then we need a witness who'll talk.

13:09.630 --> 13:11.610
There's not much chance of that.

13:12.190 --> 13:14.030
-Gideon? -Wait here.

13:25.230 --> 13:27.050
Mr. Gorban?

13:28.440 --> 13:30.740
Your name's right here on the mailbox.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.920
Mr. Gorban,please.

13:38.290 --> 13:39.800
Who are you?

13:40.910 --> 13:43.000
I'm with the FBI.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.670
Please,sir.

13:46.030 --> 13:48.210
Your neighbors have had some trouble.

13:48.230 --> 13:50.340
This has nothing to do with me.

13:50.360 --> 13:52.490
You all live in the same community.

13:52.510 --> 13:54.570
I mind my own business.

13:54.760 --> 13:57.040
Been watching us since we got here.

13:58.680 --> 14:00.720
Mr. Gorban,last night

14:00.740 --> 14:03.200
somebody grabbed Mr. Chernus right off the street.

14:03.220 --> 14:05.590
They would've had to have had a vehicle to do it

14:05.640 --> 14:08.210
large vehicle,a van

14:08.250 --> 14:10.390
did you see anything like that?

14:12.150 --> 14:13.780
Something you can describe for me?

14:13.820 --> 14:16.280
I saw nothing.Get off my porch.

14:16.315 --> 14:18.320
Mr. Gorban.Mr. Gorban.

14:30.470 --> 14:31.500
Guess who.

14:31.520 --> 14:33.240
You know these guys?

14:33.260 --> 14:34.870
Oh,yeah.

14:36.570 --> 14:38.890
Arseny lysowsky.

14:38.910 --> 14:42.150
Agent,uh,cramer how are you?

14:42.190 --> 14:44.240
What brings you out,lysowsky?

14:44.260 --> 14:46.570
I heard chernuses had problems.

14:46.590 --> 14:48.590
How did you hear that?

14:50.950 --> 14:52.590
And you are?

14:52.610 --> 14:55.170
Chernuses said they hadn't told anyone.

14:55.190 --> 14:57.830
This is a small community.Word gets out.

14:59.120 --> 15:00.940
Are you a friend of gorban's?

15:00.960 --> 15:02.960
Mr. Gorban wouldn't talk to me.

15:04.750 --> 15:07.790
Would you like me to talk to him for you?

15:07.820 --> 15:09.890
-I can't promise something will come of it--
-You!

15:10.540 --> 15:11.630
Where's my father?!

15:12.230 --> 15:12.930
Take it easy,buddy.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.300
-Wait. Wait.
-Where's my father?!

15:14.320 --> 15:14.980
Wait a minute!

15:15.430 --> 15:16.880
Do you know he has your father?

15:16.900 --> 15:18.090
He's responsible for all this

15:18.110 --> 15:20.610
why everyone's afraid him and his animals.

15:20.630 --> 15:22.390
I'm only here to help.

15:22.410 --> 15:24.660
Help?You're a dog!

15:25.030 --> 15:26.720
Natalya...

15:26.790 --> 15:28.230
How exactly can you help?

15:28.250 --> 15:31.080
In any way they'd like me to.

15:31.120 --> 15:33.780
As I said,this is a small community.

15:34.240 --> 15:38.140
If one is in pain,we're all in pain.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.260
Natalya...

15:42.240 --> 15:45.590
You didn't have to bring outsiders.

15:45.610 --> 15:47.620
Let me help you.

15:48.700 --> 15:52.490
My family will never come to you for help.

15:53.640 --> 15:55.120
Get away from my house!

15:55.140 --> 15:56.890
You are not right,Natalya.

15:57.860 --> 16:00.640
You have made the wrong decision.

16:09.030 --> 16:10.640
What did he say?

16:10.660 --> 16:12.640
Did he threaten you,natalya?

16:12.670 --> 16:14.050
Talk to us,and we can do something about it.

16:14.070 --> 16:15.060
What did he say?

16:15.080 --> 16:17.720
He said I made the wrong decision.

16:17.740 --> 16:20.320
I hope I didn'T.

16:38.320 --> 16:40.630
Time's up.Old man.

16:40.650 --> 16:42.940
But they still have more than two hours.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.020
Give me the knife.

16:44.040 --> 16:46.170
No...please...

16:47.050 --> 16:49.630
Give it to me!

16:53.080 --> 16:56.000
Just tell me.Why are you doing this?

16:56.020 --> 16:58.300
Because the FBI has come into this.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.020
Please...

17:09.140 --> 17:10.780
Natalya.

17:14.190 --> 17:16.420
Natalya.

17:19.640 --> 17:20.700
You all right?

17:20.720 --> 17:23.180
In 2 hours,if we don't send someone money we don't have

17:23.200 --> 17:24.630
my father will be mutilated again,

17:24.650 --> 17:26.710
so,no,I'm not really all right.

17:30.070 --> 17:31.430
We're workin' on it.

17:31.450 --> 17:33.370
You're working on it? You're standing right here with me.

17:33.390 --> 17:35.260
The rest of you are standing in front of the house.

17:35.280 --> 17:36.790
What exactly are you doing?

17:36.810 --> 17:38.690
We collect details.

17:38.710 --> 17:40.340
There are things that people may not even realize

17:40.360 --> 17:42.640
but they help tell us who we're looking for.

17:44.740 --> 17:46.270
I look around.

17:46.290 --> 17:48.870
I see no family pictures after your brothers died

17:49.240 --> 17:51.460
no pictures of you at all after that day.

17:51.870 --> 17:54.110
You had to graduate high school here,yeah?

17:55.840 --> 17:59.510
There's nothing to commemorate it anywhere.

17:59.700 --> 18:00.840
You don't have a family room

18:00.860 --> 18:03.610
so this should be the center of your home but look at your furniture.

18:03.630 --> 18:06.340
Sure,they may be old antiques,but they look new.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.190
They're hardly ever used.Nobody sits here.

18:09.210 --> 18:12.090
You have 2 chairs at your dining table  but 3 people live here

18:12.430 --> 18:14.550
so obviously you don't eat together.

18:17.350 --> 18:19.390
Your shoes,they may look like prada

18:19.410 --> 18:21.670
but they're knockoffs.

18:21.710 --> 18:25.320
Your bag,it's a fake designer bag.

18:25.840 --> 18:27.110
I mean no disrespect,natalya

18:27.130 --> 18:29.410
but you're trying to look like something you aren'T.

18:29.430 --> 18:30.550
That tells me that you have no money

18:30.570 --> 18:32.860
and you just don't want anybody to know.

18:34.550 --> 18:36.610
Why'd you need to know all this?

18:37.340 --> 18:41.710
It's what we call victimology and it's very important.

18:42.700 --> 18:46.360
We need to know why these people chose your family to victimize.

18:47.780 --> 18:50.140
You have any information on lysowsky at your field office?

18:50.160 --> 18:52.650
Got a lot about the organization less about him personally.

18:52.670 --> 18:54.340
I'll get garcia on it.

18:54.360 --> 18:56.310
You have other kidnapping mutilation case files?

18:56.330 --> 18:57.790
The thin ones.

18:57.810 --> 18:59.440
2 hours,14 minutes.

18:59.460 --> 19:01.430
Before you call garcia,give morgan the keys to the suburban.

19:01.450 --> 19:03.160
We're goin' to agent cramer's office.

19:03.180 --> 19:06.240
I can give you a crash course on everything you need to know about these people.

19:08.700 --> 19:11.590
How are you enjoying your assignment to the B.A.U.?

19:13.180 --> 19:15.840
Well,enjoying is an odd description.

19:15.860 --> 19:16.830
Is it?

19:16.850 --> 19:19.940
Well,we,um,deal with some pretty horrible things.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.210
I thought that was where you wanted to be.

19:22.220 --> 19:23.900
It is,definitely.

19:23.920 --> 19:25.120
Then you do enjoy it.

19:25.140 --> 19:28.790
All I'm saying is "enjoy" feels wrong.

19:28.810 --> 19:30.720
All right.What would you call it?

19:30.740 --> 19:33.370
Why do we have to end up in an interrogation?

19:34.100 --> 19:35.520
-Ambassador.
-Yes?

19:35.540 --> 19:37.210
Gregor popovich returning.

19:37.230 --> 19:38.780
Thank you.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.030
Gregor.

19:40.050 --> 19:42.390
My daughter em's in the room with me.

19:42.410 --> 19:43.780
Little emily?

19:43.800 --> 19:45.950
You have some good news for me,I hope.

19:45.970 --> 19:47.370
I'm afraid not.

19:47.390 --> 19:50.510
No one in the russian government is going to officially give you permission

19:50.530 --> 19:53.490
to look into the account holder information in this bank.

19:53.510 --> 19:55.930
Do they understand this is an emergency?

19:55.950 --> 19:57.710
They were not impressed.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.880
Uh,thank you for trying,gregor.

19:59.900 --> 20:01.850
I wish I could have done more.

20:01.870 --> 20:03.850
-Good-bye,emily.
-Good-bye,sir.

20:06.230 --> 20:08.980
I really thought he could do this.

20:09.660 --> 20:12.210
Um,I should head back to the office and let them know.

20:12.230 --> 20:15.520
Yeah. Please tell agent hotchner I'm sorry.

20:16.760 --> 20:19.100
Right.

20:23.630 --> 20:26.260
These tattoos are amazingly detailed.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.160
It's a form of communication.

20:28.180 --> 20:29.970
Each tattoo has meaning.

20:29.990 --> 20:33.390
Symbols tells the other criminals who the counterfeiters are

20:33.410 --> 20:35.250
the murderers,the armed robbers.

20:35.270 --> 20:37.850
There's a guide in that folder right there.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.840
You said they were very organized.

20:39.860 --> 20:43.320
A boss called a pakhan,or a head thief in law

20:43.340 --> 20:44.910
controls 4 criminal cells.

20:44.930 --> 20:47.770
Now,lysowsky is the pakhan in this area.

20:47.790 --> 20:51.070
The pakhan employs 2 underbosses to watch over the brigadiers.

20:51.090 --> 20:52.870
You saw them today with lysowsky.

20:52.890 --> 20:55.000
Uh,what's that circle over there to the right?

20:55.020 --> 20:56.010
The obochek.

20:56.030 --> 20:58.670
It's a pooled monetary fund the groups use for bribes

20:58.690 --> 20:59.820
and other types of support.

20:59.840 --> 21:01.530
And where does that money come from?

21:01.550 --> 21:02.750
Nobody really knows.

21:02.770 --> 21:06.120
I'd guess it comes from any number of sources,above and below.

21:06.140 --> 21:08.860
It really is just an open pool of cash

21:08.880 --> 21:12.080
that any pakhan can use almost without question.

21:13.860 --> 21:15.450
Excuse me.Cramer.

21:15.470 --> 21:17.490
Penelope garcia from quantico.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.220
Put her through.

21:19.240 --> 21:20.230
What do you have,garcia?

21:20.250 --> 21:23.890
Ok,finding information on this man
not as easy as you think.

21:23.910 --> 21:28.040
Arseny lysowsky,born 1940 in dolgoprudniy.

21:28.060 --> 21:29.270
Seems to be a lifelong criminal.

21:29.290 --> 21:31.370
I have no employment records of him at all.

21:31.390 --> 21:33.330
Married katya fulenko in 1960.

21:33.350 --> 21:35.340
She died 2 years later.

21:35.360 --> 21:40.510
He served 23 years in 4 remote prisons in perm.

21:40.530 --> 21:42.940
That's a remote region of the northern ural mountains,

21:42.960 --> 21:44.800
for those of you playing the home game.

21:45.360 --> 21:47.630
He seems to be in america legally

21:47.650 --> 21:51.390
and I have searched every nook and cranny of the chernuses' lives

21:51.410 --> 21:54.660
and I have found nothing even remotely untoward.

21:54.680 --> 21:57.930
They're law-abiding,taxpaying american citizens.

21:57.950 --> 21:58.790
Thank you,garcia.

21:59.460 --> 22:01.130
Vory v zakone.

22:01.150 --> 22:02.880
The thieves code.

22:02.900 --> 22:05.930
Breaking any of those tenets is punishable by death.

22:06.750 --> 22:10.460
"Forsake all relatives,mother,father,brother,sister."

22:11.020 --> 22:13.060
"Not have a family of his own."

22:13.520 --> 22:15.100
"No wife. No children."

22:15.120 --> 22:17.090
Family makes you vulnerable.

22:17.560 --> 22:19.740
Lysowsky owns a restaurant called little kiev.

22:19.760 --> 22:21.890
Well,you're not gonna find too many civilians eating there.

22:21.910 --> 22:24.720
But it doesn't say anything in here about helping a nonthief.

22:24.740 --> 22:25.610
No,sir.

22:25.630 --> 22:27.400
Well,why would he offer to help the chernuses?

22:27.420 --> 22:29.930
Well,the chernuses are probably fellow criminals.

22:29.950 --> 22:31.370
Why--why do you kidnap the father,

22:31.390 --> 22:33.470
and then you offer to help get him back?

22:35.580 --> 22:38.090
If I understand this man,it ju--

22:38.680 --> 22:40.550
just doesn't make any sense.

22:40.570 --> 22:42.100
Where would he be right now?

22:42.120 --> 22:43.690
Probably where he always is,

22:43.710 --> 22:45.600
in little kiev restaurant.

22:49.760 --> 22:52.990
-Anything? -Her contacts fell through.

22:53.420 --> 22:54.500
Really?

22:54.520 --> 22:56.990
Apparently she's not infallible.

23:00.600 --> 23:02.650
Was there something else?

23:02.990 --> 23:07.410
No. Uh,I just wish there was something more we could be doing for this family.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.480
We still have over an hour.

23:10.350 --> 23:12.560
Yeah.

23:19.340 --> 23:21.750
Are you hungry?I can make something.

23:21.780 --> 23:23.230
Oh,no. No.

23:23.250 --> 23:25.030
Thanks. I'm fine.

23:30.670 --> 23:33.250
I guess I'm like my mother.
When she's upset,she cooks.

23:33.310 --> 23:35.430
Heh. Really?

23:35.810 --> 23:39.790
Yeah,mine does,too.I think that's just a,uh,mom thing.

23:42.840 --> 23:45.470
-Where is your mother?
-Chicago.

23:45.500 --> 23:47.210
That's where I'm from.

23:47.230 --> 23:50.550
I'm from dolgoprudniy,just north of moscow.

23:54.510 --> 23:56.530
-You expecting someone?
-No.

24:04.100 --> 24:06.410
It's uri.Lives down the street.

24:07.660 --> 24:09.510
Go ahead.

24:14.630 --> 24:16.910
-A man said to give this to you.
-What?

24:16.940 --> 24:19.630
He said you needed it right away.

24:26.020 --> 24:27.650
Get in the house.Get in the house.

24:40.650 --> 24:42.800
Welcome to little kiev.

24:42.820 --> 24:45.000
These tattoos are like books on their skin

24:45.020 --> 24:46.190
gives their whole life story.

24:46.210 --> 24:48.890
Well,these guys are nothing if not dedicated.

24:49.270 --> 24:51.590
This all the information you have on additional kidnappings?

24:51.610 --> 24:53.760
Like I said,no one cooperates.

24:53.780 --> 24:56.210
Most of those pictures,the guys with the missing ring fingers

24:56.240 --> 24:58.400
we had to take 'em from surveillance vehicles

24:58.420 --> 25:02.060
even when we confronted them and asked them about the obviously fresh wounds,

25:02.080 --> 25:03.470
none of 'em would talk.

25:03.490 --> 25:06.910
-Vory v zakone.
-So they're all criminals?

25:06.950 --> 25:09.030
They were kidnapped,and they aren't dead.

25:09.050 --> 25:11.030
So they're payin'.

25:13.300 --> 25:14.050
Gideon.

25:14.070 --> 25:15.490
They didn't wait,man.

25:15.520 --> 25:16.330
What?

25:16.350 --> 25:17.840
They didn't wait until noon.

25:17.860 --> 25:18.910
What are you talkin' about?

25:18.930 --> 25:21.110
A kid just came to the door,and he had--

25:22.490 --> 25:24.480
they cut off Mr. Chernus' ear.

25:24.500 --> 25:26.850
But the--they got more than an hour left.

25:26.870 --> 25:29.240
They had the kid deliver it in a box with a handwritten note

25:29.260 --> 25:33.580
and it says,"we now want $500,000,and you have until 1:00."

25:34.580 --> 25:35.950
Raised the ransom.

25:36.100 --> 25:36.790
Why? Why?

25:37.230 --> 25:39.670
Well,it also says,"say hello to the fbi."

25:39.880 --> 25:41.130
Ok.

25:41.150 --> 25:42.090
What do you want me to do?

25:42.110 --> 25:43.410
Let hotch know what happened.

25:43.430 --> 25:45.000
Where's natalya?

25:45.020 --> 25:47.360
In the bathroom,and she's hysterical.

25:47.710 --> 25:49.410
Let her know we're gonna bring her father home.

25:49.430 --> 25:51.730
-Are we?
-Yes.

25:51.750 --> 25:53.230
They didn't wait?

25:53.490 --> 25:54.240
They cut off his ear.

25:54.260 --> 25:56.120
They increased the ransom to half a million.

25:56.140 --> 25:58.190
How much money do they think the chernuses have?

25:58.210 --> 26:01.440
Agent cramer,I'm gonna have to ask you to wait outside while we talk to lysowsky.

26:01.460 --> 26:02.720
-Why?
-He knows you.

26:02.740 --> 26:04.040
He deals with you on a regular basis.

26:04.060 --> 26:05.410
You're someone he needs to save face with.

26:05.430 --> 26:07.640
I don't want him posturing.

26:21.780 --> 26:23.760
Natalya.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.670
Listen,I know it feels like it may be too late

26:26.690 --> 26:29.000
but gideon thinks we may be onto something.

26:31.850 --> 26:35.880
Natalya.Natalya?

26:47.540 --> 26:49.390
Damn!

26:54.190 --> 26:56.440
There is nothing for you here.

26:59.060 --> 27:01.360
No,it's all--it's all right,alexander.

27:01.380 --> 27:02.930
Allow the gentlemen in.

27:12.160 --> 27:14.170
Would you like something to eat?

27:14.190 --> 27:15.860
This borscht is exquisite.

27:15.880 --> 27:18.990
It's my mother's old country recipe.

27:19.010 --> 27:22.740
Didn't you forsake all your relatives when you swore the thieves code?

27:22.760 --> 27:25.200
I didn't forsake her recipes.

27:25.320 --> 27:26.570
Borscht?

27:27.160 --> 27:28.010
No,thanks.

27:28.030 --> 27:29.670
I'd love a taste.

27:31.120 --> 27:32.940
You know,you should take some home.

27:32.960 --> 27:34.560
You will not regret.

27:35.340 --> 27:37.370
We need to talk,arseny.

27:37.610 --> 27:39.900
We are on a first-name basis?

27:39.920 --> 27:43.130
I still don't even know who you are.

27:43.460 --> 27:45.850
I think I understand something about this.

27:47.410 --> 27:48.900
You have a problem.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.200
Thank you.

27:50.220 --> 27:51.440
I do?

27:51.460 --> 27:53.920
That's why you came to the chernuses' house this morning.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.020
I went there to offer my help.

27:58.100 --> 28:02.200
There's no reason I can see for a man like you to help a family like the chernuses.

28:05.240 --> 28:06.900
Man like me?

28:06.920 --> 28:10.570
4 watchtowers and a convict signifies a stay in prison.

28:10.590 --> 28:13.460
Each one of those crosses represents an individual sentence.

28:13.480 --> 28:16.390
23 years in prison in the ural mountains...

28:17.480 --> 28:20.750
doesn't breed a compassionate friend.

28:22.500 --> 28:25.620
You think you know russian prison life?

28:25.640 --> 28:27.550
I know human behavior.

28:28.700 --> 28:30.690
You haven't where you've gotten in this organization

28:30.710 --> 28:34.010
by rching out to civilian families in need.

28:35.180 --> 28:38.320
No,sir. You have a problem,arseny.

28:39.140 --> 28:42.100
Someone in your organization's out of control.

28:42.630 --> 28:45.460
You may know american behavior...

28:46.420 --> 28:49.080
but you don't understand us.

28:49.140 --> 28:51.780
Don't forget your borscht on the way out.

28:51.830 --> 28:54.890
If anyone in odessa learns you have a maverick

28:55.690 --> 28:57.620
you lose everything.

28:57.640 --> 28:59.370
Good-bye.

28:59.390 --> 29:01.730
They might even kill you.

29:03.620 --> 29:05.900
I am in control.

29:07.690 --> 29:09.270
You know tattoos?

29:10.210 --> 29:13.260
Then you'll know what this means.

29:16.210 --> 29:18.760
You're a thief in law,the boss.

29:18.780 --> 29:22.150
In my world,there is no such a thing as a control problem.

29:22.460 --> 29:26.350
There is controlled... and there is dead.

29:27.280 --> 29:30.490
Mr. Lysowsky...you said you could help me.

29:30.510 --> 29:32.650
Don't you already have help?

29:33.470 --> 29:35.250
I made a mistake.

29:35.270 --> 29:37.020
I talked to my father on the phone.

29:37.340 --> 29:39.290
-He's fine.
-What?

29:39.900 --> 29:42.280
Thank you for coming,but I don't need your help.

29:53.530 --> 29:55.480
Has something happened?

29:56.040 --> 29:59.260
Yes. The kidnappers didn't wait until noon.

29:59.280 --> 30:01.810
They cut off mr. Chernus' ear and sent it to his daughter.

30:01.830 --> 30:03.040
Oh,god.

30:03.640 --> 30:04.140
Is he--

30:04.160 --> 30:05.880
no. We don't think so.

30:05.890 --> 30:09.210
But they've given us a new deadline and increased the ransom demand.

30:09.580 --> 30:11.710
You still think I enjoy all of this?

30:13.110 --> 30:16.560
Are they still instructed to wire the money to the same bank in moscow?

30:16.580 --> 30:18.150
Yes. I think so.

30:18.170 --> 30:21.140
Something your computer expert said this morning about

30:21.160 --> 30:24.480
if she understood how russian banks hold their data

30:24.500 --> 30:26.680
she could get information about account holders.

30:26.700 --> 30:27.560
Right.

30:27.580 --> 30:30.030
After you left,I called gregor back.

30:30.150 --> 30:33.190
He made some calls,gave me this.

30:33.210 --> 30:36.960
He said she would understand it.

30:43.220 --> 30:44.320
Natalya!

30:44.340 --> 30:45.890
Natalya,wait a minute!

30:45.910 --> 30:47.860
Natalya!

30:51.570 --> 30:52.850
What are we doin'?

30:52.870 --> 30:54.350
We're just gonna let her go with him?

30:54.370 --> 30:55.640
What choice do we have,man?

30:55.660 --> 30:56.290
Oh,so what?

30:56.310 --> 30:57.190
What,we get on a plane,

30:57.210 --> 30:58.880
we go home and pretend none of this happened?

30:58.900 --> 31:01.120
We have a victim who claims the crime never occurred.

31:01.140 --> 31:03.890
No. We have a daughter of a victim who claims the crime never occurred.

31:03.910 --> 31:05.470
Well,if she says that she talks to him and he's ok,

31:05.490 --> 31:07.750
then what proof do we have it even happened?

31:07.770 --> 31:09.440
The body parts.

31:11.340 --> 31:13.680
Where's the ear?

31:15.650 --> 31:18.220
Natalya's got it.

31:22.210 --> 31:23.540
-J.J.
-Yeah,morgan.

31:23.560 --> 31:25.270
Look in the cooler.

31:25.290 --> 31:29.270
Mrs. Chernus,I need to look inside the cooler.

31:29.290 --> 31:30.350
What?

31:30.370 --> 31:32.380
It's for morgan.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.000
Tell her I-I'm not gonna take anything.

31:35.020 --> 31:36.650
I just need to look inside.

31:49.350 --> 31:51.430
The finger's gone,too.

32:13.460 --> 32:16.440
Natalya.Natalya!

32:38.280 --> 32:39.750
She's not here,

32:39.770 --> 32:41.540
and the garbage was never taken out.

32:41.560 --> 32:42.080
What?

32:42.100 --> 32:43.580
When hotch first talked to her,

32:43.600 --> 32:46.920
he said she noticed her father's car in the driveway when she took the garbage out.

32:46.940 --> 32:47.580
Right.

32:47.600 --> 32:49.290
Garbage can in the kitchen is completely full.

32:49.310 --> 32:51.460
-She never took it out.
-She lied.

32:51.480 --> 32:53.690
She could halfway to dogo-wherever by now.

32:53.710 --> 32:55.340
-Dolgoprudniy?
-Yeah.

32:55.360 --> 32:56.800
It's the town she's from in russia.

32:56.820 --> 32:58.920
Isn't that where lysowsky's from?

33:00.810 --> 33:02.660
It's bread crumbs.

33:02.680 --> 33:03.720
I'm sorry.

33:03.740 --> 33:09.790
It's a set of address strings and passwords a path. See?

33:09.800 --> 33:13.200
I'm jumping from site to site,country to country

33:13.220 --> 33:16.280
and each time I get a cursor

33:16.320 --> 33:20.880
I put in the next address and password.

33:21.270 --> 33:23.760
It's the equivalent of bread crumbs to hansel and gretel.

33:29.930 --> 33:32.520
What is that?

33:33.320 --> 33:38.700
It's downloading the structure of nadka bank's server to me.

33:38.760 --> 33:39.770
Are you kidding?

33:39.790 --> 33:41.910
Whoever gave these instructions is really good.

33:41.930 --> 33:44.350
So you can get the account information noW.

33:44.370 --> 33:46.410
If I can figure this out.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.500
So we have a daughter who lied about how she discovered the crime

33:51.520 --> 33:54.300
none of the missing body parts to prove anything actually happened

33:54.320 --> 33:56.810
and a generic ransom note that mentions no names.

33:56.830 --> 33:58.510
So what are we sayin'?

33:58.890 --> 34:00.900
Natalya was a part of this.

34:00.940 --> 34:02.310
How did I not see this comin'?

34:02.340 --> 34:03.420
How could any of us,man?

34:03.440 --> 34:04.410
She sought us out.

34:04.420 --> 34:06.770
We were so blinded by the fact that she trusted us

34:06.790 --> 34:09.100
that we never considered not trusting her.

34:11.730 --> 34:13.870
-I'm in.
-You're kidding.

34:13.889 --> 34:16.530
It's a pretty archaic system once the parameters are understood.

34:16.550 --> 34:17.290
Account number,please?

34:17.310 --> 34:24.780
-Ok.
-155293846729.

34:34.710 --> 34:36.330
Why?

34:36.350 --> 34:38.770
Why would she even bring us into this?

34:41.889 --> 34:43.850
Yeah. What?

34:44.219 --> 34:46.770
You're sure?

34:48.380 --> 34:50.449
Ok. Thanks.

34:50.620 --> 34:52.090
Garcia just got into the bank's system.

34:52.110 --> 34:54.730
Somebody wired $500,000 into the account 10 minutes ago.

34:54.750 --> 34:55.389
Who wired it?

34:55.409 --> 34:56.400
She didn't say where it came from,

34:56.420 --> 34:58.410
but the name on the account is lyov fulenko.

34:58.430 --> 35:01.950
She says that's lysowsky's wife's maiden name,fulenko.

35:01.970 --> 35:04.690
Why did she need to bring us in?

35:06.060 --> 35:08.790
'Cause she needed to put pressure on the other victim.

35:09.390 --> 35:11.200
Other victim?

35:24.810 --> 35:26.960
Money. 500,000.

35:26.980 --> 35:28.560
It's all here.

35:28.920 --> 35:30.470
You see,old man.

35:30.490 --> 35:32.630
I told you they'd pay money.

35:32.650 --> 35:33.650
We're finished.

35:38.440 --> 35:40.540
Yes,fyodor.

35:40.575 --> 35:42.440
We are finished.

35:51.590 --> 35:54.150
Mr. Gorban,I'm not gonna ask you anything official.

35:54.170 --> 35:56.110
Just have a simple question.

35:56.130 --> 35:57.920
I don't have anything to say.

35:57.940 --> 36:00.280
You were kidnapped once,mr. Gorban?

36:02.460 --> 36:06.100
When the men kidnapped you,who paid your ransom?

36:06.460 --> 36:09.030
Mr. Gorban,your house,the way you're dressed,

36:09.390 --> 36:11.680
you don't have any tattoos--you're not a criminal.

36:11.700 --> 36:12.680
No.

36:12.700 --> 36:15.460
Well,how could your family have paid a ransom for you?

36:17.050 --> 36:19.180
Was arseny lysowsky,wasn't it?

36:23.690 --> 36:25.770
Thanks,mr. Gorban.

36:29.870 --> 36:32.180
Paid the ransom already.

36:32.660 --> 36:34.750
Paid all the ransoms.

36:35.100 --> 36:36.730
SiT.

36:36.750 --> 36:38.830
Are they gonna kill mr. Chernus?

36:41.350 --> 36:43.800
No.

36:45.500 --> 36:47.960
Why are you paying these ransoms?

36:48.260 --> 36:50.690
-What's goin' on here?
-I think I know.

36:50.710 --> 36:53.240
The account is in the name of lyov fulenko.

36:53.260 --> 36:56.630
Lyov's a man's name,a son's name.

36:56.650 --> 36:58.460
Vory v zakone.

36:58.480 --> 37:02.150
Never have a family of your own. No wife.No children.

37:03.160 --> 37:07.010
"Lyov." You know what it means?

37:12.660 --> 37:14.480
Time's up,old man.

37:14.500 --> 37:16.670
No.

37:16.690 --> 37:19.280
Na-natalya?

37:29.240 --> 37:31.050
When we started this a year ago,

37:31.070 --> 37:34.340
we agreed there would be no witnesses.

37:35.910 --> 37:38.160
Where we're going,witnesses won't matter.

37:38.180 --> 37:41.620
No,my love.That is sloppy.

37:41.990 --> 37:44.350
If he tells my father who did this,

37:44.370 --> 37:47.340
everything we've done will fall.

37:47.880 --> 37:48.830
He'll hunt us down.

37:52.120 --> 37:54.090
Let me say good-bye to him.

38:00.760 --> 38:03.800
I'm sorry,papa.

38:04.820 --> 38:07.140
I couldn't do it anymore...

38:08.330 --> 38:14.360
Living in that house with my brothers hanging over everything...

38:16.630 --> 38:19.090
the--the sadness and the struggle.

38:19.110 --> 38:21.560
You brought us here so we could have things and we have nothinG.

38:21.580 --> 38:25.430
We're nothing. I need more.

38:29.140 --> 38:34.680
I'm gonna go away,gonna live my life happy.

38:37.030 --> 38:40.040
I'm sorry.

38:44.820 --> 38:47.210
I knew when the first man was taken.

38:47.230 --> 38:49.720
I knew who had done it.

38:49.740 --> 38:54.850
No one else would be so bold and so stupid.

38:54.870 --> 38:57.320
Tell me where mr. Chernus is.

38:57.340 --> 38:58.850
At first,it didn't mean much.

38:58.870 --> 39:02.080
It was a way of letting him earn his own money.

39:02.100 --> 39:03.090
I could afford it.

39:03.110 --> 39:04.990
It came from the fund,and...

39:07.060 --> 39:10.660
no one questions the use of the fund.

39:10.680 --> 39:11.680
Where is he?

39:12.150 --> 39:14.220
What else could I do?

39:14.300 --> 39:19.230
I couldn't admit that i wasn't blessing the kidnappings.

39:19.250 --> 39:22.550
I couldn't even admit that my son existed.

39:27.130 --> 39:29.710
Chernus will be home in a few minutes.

39:29.730 --> 39:30.660
You should be there.

39:30.680 --> 39:33.090
He's going to need medical attention.

39:33.110 --> 39:35.170
Go. Go.

39:41.120 --> 39:43.010
What are you gonna do?

39:45.040 --> 39:47.170
Vory v zakonE.

39:48.390 --> 39:52.100
We take care of our own troubles.

39:57.130 --> 39:59.590
I'll wait outside.

40:01.320 --> 40:04.050
Put the knife down,lyov.

40:11.850 --> 40:14.230
It's time to pay.

41:14.660 --> 41:17.310
"Happy families are all alike.

41:17.320 --> 41:21.160
Every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."

41:21.730 --> 41:23.560
Leo tolstoY.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.660
We got him.

41:32.680 --> 41:33.980
Mr. Chernus is safe now.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.680
Oh. Good.

41:35.700 --> 41:37.020
We couldn't've done it without you.

41:37.040 --> 41:40.140
Ah. Well,I'm sure that isn't true.

41:40.160 --> 41:42.280
Agent hotchner wanted me to say thank you for him.

41:42.300 --> 41:45.910
Well,tell him I'm glad I could help.

41:46.330 --> 41:50.070
Anyway,I thought you would wanna know how it all came out.

41:50.100 --> 41:52.770
It was nice to feel needed again.

41:53.450 --> 41:54.970
What--what did you say?

41:54.990 --> 41:59.840
Well,I don't mean to be overly dramatic,but...

42:00.470 --> 42:04.170
I am an ambassador without an assignment.

42:04.740 --> 42:06.910
You--you've been without assignments before.

42:06.930 --> 42:08.990
Yeah,but never for this long,

42:09.010 --> 42:12.120
and one does begin to wonder.

42:13.250 --> 42:15.960
What? Did I say something wrong?

42:15.980 --> 42:19.070
I don't think I've ever seen you doubt yourself before.

42:19.110 --> 42:23.440
I doubt myself all the time,emily.

42:23.460 --> 42:25.980
It's just not showing it.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.180
That's what being a diplomat's all about.

42:33.270 --> 42:36.160
Would you like to go to dinner?

42:39.020 --> 42:41.800
-My treat?
-Definitely.

42:41.870 --> 42:44.040
Yeah.

42:44.090 --> 42:46.440
Yeah. Think I would.
