00:13.700 --> 00:17.670
Hey, Paul, it's not cool
that he's calling your shoes gay.

00:18.600 --> 00:20.200
No. It hurts.

00:21.200 --> 00:22.670
Why are you calling his shoes gay?

00:23.040 --> 00:25.810
Well, I didn't mean,
like, gay, "homosexual" gay.

00:26.080 --> 00:27.740
I mean, like, "stupid" gay.

00:27.810 --> 00:30.180
- Why say either?
- Exactly.

00:30.580 --> 00:32.380
'Cause bullying is weak.

00:32.780 --> 00:34.220
- But kindness...
- Kindness...

00:34.280 --> 00:35.790
Is savage.

00:36.650 --> 00:37.520
That was great.

00:37.590 --> 00:39.590
- All right, one more scenario?
- Let's do it.

00:39.660 --> 00:41.190
- Awesome.
- All right, so...

00:41.320 --> 00:43.630
Cindy wants to ask Paul to the dance.

00:44.360 --> 00:45.730
But Paul can't stop making fun

00:45.800 --> 00:47.460
- of her style.
- I drew the dicks.

00:49.770 --> 00:52.700
So, um... Okay, so, uh...

00:52.770 --> 00:54.340
Hey, I drew the dicks.

00:55.100 --> 00:56.240
I drew the dicks.

00:56.770 --> 00:58.470
Christa blew the dicks.

00:58.540 --> 01:00.240
Oh, yes, he did.

01:01.210 --> 01:02.080
I drew the dicks.

01:02.140 --> 01:03.750
- I drew the dicks.
- I drew the dicks.

01:03.810 --> 01:05.310
I drew the dicks.

01:05.379 --> 01:07.480
- I drew the dicks!
- Nope.

01:07.550 --> 01:08.820
- Okay.
- This will stop.

01:09.350 --> 01:12.290
- Stop it right now. Stop it right now.
- I drew the dicks...

01:12.420 --> 01:14.590
I want this over and done with now.

01:14.690 --> 01:18.130
Stop it. Stop it. All of you,
stop filming right now. Right now.

01:43.720 --> 01:47.760
Right now. Right now.
I said, stop it right now.

01:47.820 --> 01:49.330
No more filming.

01:49.790 --> 01:51.730
Although it was well-intentioned,

01:51.790 --> 01:55.700
the protests at the cyberbullying assembly
did more harm than good.

01:55.760 --> 01:58.300
- I drew the dicks...
- I want Ecklund and Maldonado

01:58.370 --> 01:59.370
in my office.

02:00.370 --> 02:03.770
Sam and I aren't seniors,
so, we weren't even at the assembly,

02:03.840 --> 02:07.880
but the administration blamed us
for the frenzy surrounding the vandalism.

02:09.479 --> 02:10.680
So, later that day,

02:10.910 --> 02:13.550
Vice Principal Keene called us
into his office

02:13.680 --> 02:17.890
to tell us that American Vandal
has been banned from Hanover High.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.490
No more working out of the TV studio.

02:23.260 --> 02:25.360
No more filming on school grounds.

02:25.690 --> 02:28.230
No one's even allowed
to watch the show during lunch

02:28.300 --> 02:30.300
without facing serious consequences.

02:31.270 --> 02:36.510
But fortunately no one can stop us
from filming this documentary off-campus.

02:38.610 --> 02:41.480
Remember I told you
that by identifying the car with splatter,

02:41.540 --> 02:45.250
we'd be able to identify the first car hit
and, in turn, the potential target?

02:46.250 --> 02:47.820
Right there. Splatter, right there.

02:48.420 --> 02:51.490
Identifying a target.

02:55.490 --> 02:57.430
Look for anything that could be splatter.

02:57.490 --> 03:00.200
Splatter will lead to target,
target will lead to motive.

03:00.260 --> 03:02.260
- Anything?
- Anything that could be splatter.

03:02.900 --> 03:04.770
It's hard to determine
what's splatter.

03:04.830 --> 03:06.900
For any one of these,
where it's at the tip...

03:06.970 --> 03:09.670
I mean, is that splatter,
or is that just cum? Who knows?

03:10.310 --> 03:13.210
Oh, what about this one?
Right here at the top.

03:13.710 --> 03:17.550
No, dude, I don't think
someone would start drawing a dick

03:17.610 --> 03:19.980
at the mushroom head.
That just doesn't feel right.

03:20.680 --> 03:24.220
You're right, that doesn't feel...
That's a really good point, actually.

03:24.650 --> 03:26.360
The splatter would only happen

03:26.420 --> 03:29.220
on the first car
at the first point of contact,

03:29.690 --> 03:31.360
and if you've ever drawn a dick,

03:31.430 --> 03:33.830
you know you don't start
in the middle of the shaft.

03:33.900 --> 03:36.770
You either start with the balls
or at the bottom of the shaft.

03:37.230 --> 03:39.540
This is where we're looking for splatter.

03:41.700 --> 03:43.470
Ooh. Hmm.

03:44.340 --> 03:46.780
Yeah. Yeah.
This could definitely be splatter. Look.

03:47.580 --> 03:48.880
- That's dripping.
- Splatter.

03:48.940 --> 03:50.950
- That's definitely splatter.
- Definitely.

03:51.010 --> 03:53.550
- Whose car is that one?
- This is Rafferty's. Okay.

03:54.950 --> 03:58.590
After a thorough look at all the dicks,
we were able to narrow it down

03:58.650 --> 04:00.920
to three cars with potential splatter.

04:02.990 --> 04:06.560
Maeda, Rafferty, and Vice Principal Keene.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.770
One, Mr. Keene, the vice principal.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.540
Two, Mr. Maeda, the physics teacher.

04:13.940 --> 04:18.339
And three, Mr. Rafferty,
the PE teacher and football coach.

04:19.310 --> 04:21.339
They are the possible splatter victims.

04:21.410 --> 04:23.310
So, now we have to work backwards,

04:23.410 --> 04:26.480
and see who would have a possible vendetta
against these three.

04:26.550 --> 04:28.780
Okay. And how exactly are we supposed
to do that?

04:29.390 --> 04:31.790
How do you uncover a vendetta?

04:32.050 --> 04:35.490
It's not the sort of thing people
openly post about online.

04:36.060 --> 04:37.460
Or maybe it is.

04:37.890 --> 04:40.600
Sam and I learned
that all official complaints made

04:40.660 --> 04:44.600
against teachers in California
public schools are public information.

04:44.830 --> 04:48.500
They're all kept in a database online
that's easily searchable.

04:48.940 --> 04:51.910
So, if a student made a complaint
against a Hanover teacher,

04:51.970 --> 04:53.740
there's a chance it's documented.

04:54.010 --> 04:58.450
But when I searched for Rafferty,
Maeda, and Keene, nothing came up.

04:59.420 --> 05:01.980
In fact,
Hanover High School hasn't uploaded

05:02.050 --> 05:05.990
a single teacher complaint file
in the last four years.

05:06.860 --> 05:08.360
Bullshit. They can't do that.

05:08.420 --> 05:10.660
We're gonna have to talk
to the teachers directly,

05:10.730 --> 05:12.830
talk to Rafferty or Maeda,

05:12.900 --> 05:15.760
and find out if anybody
has a possible vendetta against them.

05:15.830 --> 05:17.700
What? No, dude, we can't do that.

05:18.700 --> 05:21.000
The moment we walk into Hanover
with a camera,

05:21.070 --> 05:22.540
Keene is going to kill us.

05:31.110 --> 05:32.110
What do you think?

05:33.450 --> 05:35.980
Uh, I think it looks pretty fucking weird

05:36.050 --> 05:38.520
that you just have your phone
in your shirt pocket.

05:38.590 --> 05:39.460
People do it.

05:39.520 --> 05:40.390
No, they don't.

05:41.790 --> 05:42.860
Yeah, they do.

05:43.490 --> 05:46.500
- You think Gabi will drive us to school?
- What, like, now?

05:46.560 --> 05:50.630
Yeah. Yeah, we got like... 45 minutes
until office hours are over.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.570
This is just a bad plan.

05:53.140 --> 05:55.000
No, it's not. No one's gonna notice.

05:55.470 --> 05:58.640
You're overthinking it.
All right, call Gabi. Come on.

06:03.110 --> 06:06.080
- Hey, Coach Rafferty, you got a minute?
- Yeah. Come on in, boys.

06:06.150 --> 06:09.020
Hey, so, we were hoping
we could ask you just a few questions.

06:09.750 --> 06:13.060
- What's with the camera in your pocket?
- Oh, no, he puts that there.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.590
- People do that.
- Yeah. I have stuff in my pockets.

06:15.660 --> 06:16.830
Yeah. Okay.

06:17.890 --> 06:21.000
I don't care. If you wanna keep filming,
go ahead. What do you want?

06:21.400 --> 06:23.600
Um, so, we have reason to believe

06:23.670 --> 06:26.940
that the vandalism on March 15th
was carried out to target you.

06:27.900 --> 06:29.100
- Is that right?
- Right.

06:29.440 --> 06:31.710
So, the question is,
does any student at the school

06:31.770 --> 06:33.810
have a vendetta against you,
that you know of, maybe?

06:33.880 --> 06:36.180
- Ooh. A vendetta? No. I hope not.
- Yeah.

06:36.580 --> 06:38.710
Any idea as to who would target you?

06:38.780 --> 06:41.050
Any student in particular
that dislikes you?

06:43.190 --> 06:46.590
Guys, you're talking to the
Hanover High School Teacher of the Year.

06:46.820 --> 06:47.690
People love me.

06:48.760 --> 06:51.830
Right, but, you know,
maybe a student you benched,

06:52.460 --> 06:54.530
or you took out for the season.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.930
I don't know. Any... The smallest thing.

06:58.870 --> 06:59.770
I'll tell you what.

07:01.470 --> 07:04.470
If I can think of anything,
I'll let you guys know.

07:04.940 --> 07:05.970
- Okay. Cool.
- Great.

07:06.040 --> 07:07.580
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, guys.

07:07.640 --> 07:08.680
I really appreciate it.

07:08.740 --> 07:10.110
Oh, was Kyle Rafferty a target?

07:10.750 --> 07:13.680
Oh, does someone
maybe not like Kyle Rafferty? Oh.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.990
Oh, I'm so surprised
someone might hate Kyle Rafferty.

07:17.050 --> 07:18.050
That guy sucks, dude.

07:18.520 --> 07:19.990
Kyle Rafferty sucks.

07:20.060 --> 07:21.820
So, what, like, what's the theory?

07:22.020 --> 07:23.990
- 'Cause of the spray paint?
- The splatter.

07:24.060 --> 07:25.960
He was probably
one of the first cars hit.

07:26.030 --> 07:26.900
Okay.

07:27.500 --> 07:30.570
I hope it was Kyle Rafferty.
That'd be the perfect ending to this.

07:30.630 --> 07:31.870
God, that guy sucks.

07:32.900 --> 07:35.200
Kraz is the only teacher
who will talk to us

07:35.470 --> 07:37.040
about the potential splatter victims,

07:37.240 --> 07:40.040
because now he has nothing to lose.

07:41.510 --> 07:46.620
So, I have been fired, which I guess
I should have seen that coming.

07:46.750 --> 07:50.250
I said a lot of things that...
I regret.

07:50.520 --> 07:53.020
- I'm so sorry.
- It's not your fault. It's not your fault.

07:53.090 --> 07:55.220
- I'm sorry. I really didn't mean
- It's not you.

07:55.490 --> 07:59.530
- For my documentary to get you in trouble.
- No, it's awesome. Congratulations. Great.

07:59.860 --> 08:02.970
And, you know, and now that...
Hey, now that people are watching, I...

08:03.030 --> 08:04.030
If anyone's...

08:04.770 --> 08:05.970
I need a job.

08:06.570 --> 08:08.540
I can do...
I know history stuff, obviously.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.610
I don't wanna do it...
Be a history teacher.

08:10.670 --> 08:11.710
I don't wanna do that.

08:11.770 --> 08:14.940
But if you have a job that you need
someone who knows history stuff...

08:15.040 --> 08:16.910
I can never go back to doing that, man.

08:17.680 --> 08:20.720
The thing people don't realize
about being a history teacher is...

08:20.820 --> 08:22.250
dude, it is so boring.

08:22.520 --> 08:25.190
But, I mean,
was the school just in firing me?

08:26.660 --> 08:28.820
Honestly, yeah. Yes.

08:28.890 --> 08:30.130
And that's Kyle Rafferty.

08:31.090 --> 08:33.200
That dude has, like, roofied people.

08:33.260 --> 08:34.830
I said that Kyle Rafferty...

08:34.960 --> 08:37.799
I believe I said he drugs people
and pays for sex.

08:38.230 --> 08:42.000
I compared Shapiro to that guy
on Game of Thrones with no dick.

08:42.669 --> 08:44.740
And by the way,
I'm just gonna be an open book

08:44.810 --> 08:47.040
about all of these teachers from now on,

08:47.110 --> 08:48.980
'cause what are they gonna do,
fire me again?

08:55.620 --> 08:57.850
Uh, we were just hoping
to ask you a couple questions.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.150
Uh, yeah. Okay.

09:00.120 --> 09:01.860
- Awesome. Thank you.
- Yep.

09:04.160 --> 09:08.760
Uh... Well,
I guess our first question would be, um...

09:09.230 --> 09:13.100
do you have any students that might have
some sort of vendetta against you?

09:13.170 --> 09:16.870
Any students that... just stand out,
dislike you?

09:18.340 --> 09:21.010
Well, there are plenty of students
who dislike me, you know?

09:21.080 --> 09:22.010
I'm a tough teacher.

09:22.140 --> 09:25.950
Mr. Maeda, the physics teacher,
has a reputation of his own.

09:26.150 --> 09:29.080
He's known for confiscating electronics
from students,

09:29.150 --> 09:31.250
so,
we didn't just go in looking for gossip.

09:31.350 --> 09:33.860
We were also looking for evidence.

09:33.920 --> 09:36.160
Have you ever talked to him?
He's a creepy man.

09:36.220 --> 09:38.990
He's also kind of a jerk of a teacher.

09:40.760 --> 09:43.330
I see someone pull out electronics,
I take it away.

09:43.970 --> 09:45.600
Keep it till the end of semester.

09:45.930 --> 09:49.910
I don't want someone back here
playing Candy Crush while I'm mid-lecture.

09:49.970 --> 09:52.340
Doesn't he do that thing,
he takes students' phones

09:52.610 --> 09:53.740
for, like, a whole semester?

09:53.810 --> 09:54.840
You can't do that.

09:55.140 --> 09:56.280
That should be illegal.

09:56.350 --> 09:58.950
To take someone's phone
for a whole semester?

09:59.010 --> 10:01.120
I would have had a vendetta
against that guy.

10:01.180 --> 10:02.620
Playing Candy Crush?

10:03.050 --> 10:05.250
No, that's unacceptable.
That's not gonna happen.

10:05.890 --> 10:07.860
That's how I confiscated that iPad Pro.

10:08.020 --> 10:09.890
Was the student, like, really upset?

10:10.830 --> 10:12.230
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'd say so.

10:12.290 --> 10:14.060
Tears, begging.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.060
Yeah. But it was necessary, you know?

10:16.130 --> 10:18.270
I needed to set the tone early.

10:18.800 --> 10:19.900
Whose iPad was it?

10:20.700 --> 10:24.170
Oh, I... No.
It's not right for me to say whose...

10:24.240 --> 10:26.140
It was Sara's. Pearson.

10:27.180 --> 10:29.340
That's right. Sara Pearson.

10:29.880 --> 10:33.720
The girl Alex Trimboli claimed to get
to third base with at Camp Miniwaka.

10:34.120 --> 10:37.190
She's also one
of our most popular fan theories.

10:37.650 --> 10:41.720
Could she have a vendetta against Maeda
for confiscating her iPad?

10:41.990 --> 10:45.130
It's possible,
but she's got a solid alibi.

10:45.260 --> 10:48.930
On March 15th,
she was in San Diego with her family.

10:49.730 --> 10:52.070
- Put that down. That's not yours.
- Thank you.

10:52.130 --> 10:53.240
We appreciate your help.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.200
- Sorry.
- Sorry about that, sir.

10:56.270 --> 10:58.940
- Thank you for your time.
- Thank you. Have a good night.

10:59.270 --> 11:01.140
- What did you see on the iPad?
- Just go.

11:02.280 --> 11:04.150
What Sam found on Sara's iPad

11:04.250 --> 11:07.320
didn't give us anything pointing
to Sara as the vandal,

11:07.980 --> 11:10.950
but it did give us something else
worth investigating.

11:11.190 --> 11:12.690
- Pete, are you recording?
- Mm-hm.

11:12.750 --> 11:15.120
Uh, hold on, I took a screenshot
and I sent it to myself.

11:15.190 --> 11:16.960
Just has to load real quick. There.

11:17.390 --> 11:21.960
It's an iMessage conversation
between Sara Pearson and Paige Davidson.

11:22.330 --> 11:25.930
"He's not as big as Brad, though."
Crying laughing.

11:26.330 --> 11:30.910
"LOL. I still can't believe
Pat is on both of our lists."

11:31.210 --> 11:33.410
"You left someone off yours."

11:33.840 --> 11:35.240
"Who?"

11:35.810 --> 11:38.150
"Alex Trimboli.

11:38.350 --> 11:41.050
Put him on there, make it an even 15."

11:41.250 --> 11:43.790
"Ha-ha."

11:43.990 --> 11:47.890
"We all know you touched his dick.
Add it to your list."

11:48.190 --> 11:50.830
"That's not even possible.

11:51.090 --> 11:55.060
Last day of camp I left early
to meet up with Brandon Galloway."

11:55.230 --> 11:58.230
"Oh, I forgot about that."

11:59.130 --> 12:00.840
So, what do we take from this?

12:01.100 --> 12:02.240
A few things.

12:02.870 --> 12:05.240
We know
that Sara Pearson has a hookup list.

12:05.840 --> 12:07.880
We know that there are 14 people on it,

12:07.980 --> 12:10.480
and that Brad Cormack
is doing well for himself.

12:11.110 --> 12:15.420
We also know that Pat Micklewaite
isn't only on Sara Pearson's hookup list,

12:15.820 --> 12:18.190
he's on Paige Davidson's
hookup list, as well.

12:19.190 --> 12:20.360
Pat Micklewaite.

12:21.420 --> 12:23.020
But the biggest thing we learned

12:23.090 --> 12:25.760
is that Sara
didn't give Alex Trimboli a hand job.

12:26.230 --> 12:29.230
Alex was right that she needed a rebound
from Van Delory,

12:29.530 --> 12:32.300
but she didn't go to Alex Trimboli
for that rebound,

12:32.930 --> 12:34.400
she want to Brandon Galloway,

12:34.470 --> 12:37.770
which explains why she was cagey
when it came to denying the hookup.

12:38.210 --> 12:40.810
Have you ever hooked up
with Alex Trimboli?

12:42.540 --> 12:43.480
Ew.

12:43.850 --> 12:46.150
She had to keep
her alibi a secret,

12:46.210 --> 12:48.880
because Brandon was dating Gabi Granger.

12:50.120 --> 12:53.790
So, Alex didn't get any,
but looks like Brandon's been busy.

13:00.400 --> 13:03.230
Wait, Sam,
are you making a joke right now?

13:04.970 --> 13:07.470
You're dating Brandon Galloway.
What did you expect?

13:07.540 --> 13:08.540
Oh, fuck you, Sam.

13:08.870 --> 13:10.140
Just fuck you both.

13:10.410 --> 13:11.510
Find your own ride home.

13:16.580 --> 13:17.550
Is she serious?

13:18.110 --> 13:20.450
Sam, why would you
make a joke like that?

13:21.280 --> 13:23.250
- That's so mean, dude.
- Shut up.

13:24.150 --> 13:27.290
I feel terrible about the Sara
Pearson hookup list affecting Gabi.

13:27.590 --> 13:29.990
But the revelation
about Sara and Brandon

13:30.390 --> 13:31.960
answers that lingering question

13:32.030 --> 13:34.600
about the school board's key witness,
Alex Trimboli.

13:37.230 --> 13:41.240
Alex is not on Sara's hookup list,
so, we know he lied about the hand job.

13:41.970 --> 13:44.270
Uh, he lied about being tight
with Joey Themelis.

13:44.340 --> 13:45.970
The guy barely knows him.

13:46.880 --> 13:49.280
He lied about being wasted
at Nana's party. One beer.

13:50.050 --> 13:53.220
And I guarantee you,
he lied about seeing Dylan do the dicks.

13:53.420 --> 13:56.890
Right. Without Alex's testimony,
the school board literally has nothing.

13:56.950 --> 13:58.290
- They have nothing.
- Nothing.

13:58.520 --> 14:01.290
So, now all we have to do is talk
to Vice Principal Keene,

14:01.520 --> 14:04.060
find out if anyone would have a vendetta
against him.

14:04.130 --> 14:05.930
But it's not like we can record that.

14:05.990 --> 14:08.960
We can talk to him, probably,
but any trick we try and pull...

14:09.030 --> 14:10.270
The phone trick?

14:10.330 --> 14:12.070
He'll spot that from a mile away.

14:16.240 --> 14:19.340
But Keene, I could see Keene,
too. That's... That'd be a good one.

14:19.980 --> 14:22.380
Keene thinks he's,
like, this authority figure,

14:22.440 --> 14:27.280
just 'cause, you know... I guess he is...
He was my boss, and fired me.

14:27.350 --> 14:29.180
Vice Principal Keene, man.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.050
I don't trust that dude.

14:31.890 --> 14:33.920
I don't trust that dude one bit.

14:34.360 --> 14:35.490
He got secrets.

14:47.340 --> 14:49.000
- I really appreciate it.
- Yep.

14:49.070 --> 14:54.010
So, um, in order for me
to find the true vandal,

14:54.080 --> 14:56.340
I need to find the true victim
of this crime.

14:56.410 --> 14:59.250
Okay, you know what?
Dispense with all this drama, really.

14:59.310 --> 15:01.250
I mean, could you get on with it, please?

15:02.080 --> 15:02.950
Um...

15:06.020 --> 15:08.490
Sir, the faculty files are supposed
to be updated

15:08.560 --> 15:11.360
to the California Commission
of Teacher Credentials website,

15:11.430 --> 15:14.300
and Hanover High School's
hasn't been updated since 2012,

15:14.600 --> 15:15.600
which is illegal.

15:16.970 --> 15:19.500
Are you insinuating
there's some sort of conspiracy?

15:20.940 --> 15:22.500
It's clerical, okay?

15:22.570 --> 15:25.370
It's an administrative... Never mind.

15:25.440 --> 15:27.380
I wasn't... I wasn't... I was... I was...

15:28.440 --> 15:31.510
- I can't leave until I get those files.
- You know what? Guess what.

15:31.980 --> 15:34.050
You just earned yourself
a Saturday detention.

15:34.120 --> 15:38.720
- Leave now before you earn another one.
- I asked a question. I didn't do anything.

15:38.990 --> 15:40.960
What...? Are you filming?

15:41.020 --> 15:43.060
- No...
- Is that a recorder? You're recording.

15:43.120 --> 15:47.060
No, my phone... My screen
was just on. It wasn't recording...

15:57.340 --> 15:59.510
My mom's gonna fucking kill me.

16:01.140 --> 16:03.450
Are you filming?
Peter, are you serious? Stop, dude.

16:05.150 --> 16:07.750
The documentary was already banned
from campus...

16:08.650 --> 16:10.650
but now so are we.

16:11.720 --> 16:14.590
Keene gave Sam
and I a three-day suspension.

16:14.760 --> 16:17.730
He told us if
we're ever caught filming at school again,

16:18.260 --> 16:20.660
we'll be expelled, just like Dylan.

16:21.430 --> 16:24.530
If Keene says that the documentary
has been a distraction in school,

16:25.330 --> 16:27.170
honestly, I can see that.

16:27.600 --> 16:30.170
But I don't believe
that's why he suspended us.

16:30.710 --> 16:33.510
The teachers had no issue
with American Vandal at first.

16:33.640 --> 16:35.140
I think they kind of liked it.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.410
So, what changed?

16:38.150 --> 16:41.420
Narrowing the target
to Rafferty, Maeda, and Keene,

16:42.050 --> 16:44.650
learning that the administration
was hiding teacher files

16:44.750 --> 16:46.620
that should be available to the public.

16:47.690 --> 16:49.690
I think that's why we were suspended,

16:50.460 --> 16:52.490
for flying too close to the sun.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.460
It tells me
that we were getting somewhere.

16:56.330 --> 17:00.170
But the documentary was already difficult
with our limited access.

17:00.600 --> 17:04.670
Now finding the truth
feels nearly impossible.

17:17.520 --> 17:19.690
- Yo, dude.
- Hey, man.

17:19.750 --> 17:22.690
Your first suspension, man.
Congratulations.

17:22.760 --> 17:26.359
We have a little tradition we do.
It's called breakfast burritos and blunts.

17:26.460 --> 17:28.600
There's your breakfast burrito.
Grab a blunt.

17:28.660 --> 17:30.170
- Congratulations.
- Hey, Peter.

17:30.230 --> 17:31.130
- Hey.
- Yeah, buddy.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.630
- What's up, buddy?
- Uh...

17:33.500 --> 17:36.500
- Dude, I'm so proud of you.
- It's his first suspension, guys.

17:36.570 --> 17:39.440
- First suspension. Rock on.
- Shouldn't you guys be in school?

17:39.510 --> 17:42.810
- Hey, where's your boy Sam?
- Oh, uh, he got grounded.

17:43.450 --> 17:46.310
Now you're suspended, dude.
Welcome to your new life, dude.

17:46.380 --> 17:49.280
[Peter] Side note:
This was a really good burrito.

17:49.780 --> 17:51.420
So, you never smoked weed before?

17:52.790 --> 17:54.090
Never?

17:54.160 --> 17:56.360
- Man, you gotta try it.
- No, I have asthma, so...

17:57.130 --> 17:58.260
Yeah, so, weed will help.

17:58.730 --> 18:00.130
Isn't weed good for asthma?

18:00.200 --> 18:01.660
- Yeah.
- Weed's good for everything.

18:01.730 --> 18:03.330
- Yeah.
- Did you see that dude

18:03.400 --> 18:07.770
that had an epileptic attack,
and then, like, you know, like...?

18:08.170 --> 18:11.270
Yeah, there was that one chick that...
She couldn't walk, remember?

18:11.340 --> 18:13.370
And then she smoked,
and she was just like...

18:14.240 --> 18:15.710
In that video. I saw that video.

18:16.340 --> 18:18.780
- Hey, we gotta go, yo.
- Yeah, we gotta go.

18:19.310 --> 18:21.850
- We'll be back after school, man.
- You were so cool.

18:22.480 --> 18:24.620
- All right. Deuces Bigelow.
- Let's do it again.

18:25.490 --> 18:26.820
Congratulations again, Pete.

18:27.790 --> 18:28.660
Bye, guys.

18:30.130 --> 18:32.430
Dylan and his friends considered
my suspension

18:32.490 --> 18:34.130
some sort of badge of honor,

18:34.400 --> 18:35.730
a rite of passage.

18:36.330 --> 18:38.900
I don't think they fully understood
how much the suspension

18:39.170 --> 18:40.670
was hindering our investigation.

18:41.170 --> 18:42.670
I needed to be at school,

18:42.740 --> 18:45.510
digging up more dirt on Rafferty,
Maeda, and Keene.

18:46.310 --> 18:52.280
Instead, I was at Dylan's house,
watching him spend another day alone.

18:52.810 --> 18:57.220
It's pretty sick when they, like,
skip a period to come chill, or whatever.

18:57.290 --> 19:00.890
Like, we used to do that all the time,
when one of us would get suspended, but...

19:01.720 --> 19:06.260
since this whole shit went down,
it's pretty much just been me.

19:07.700 --> 19:08.600
Actually...

19:08.660 --> 19:10.370
Everyone's at school right now.

19:10.570 --> 19:11.900
I'm just stuck here,

19:12.870 --> 19:14.440
and I can't go there,

19:15.340 --> 19:18.610
which is just such a weird thing
to be mad about,

19:19.640 --> 19:20.740
so, like, I'm just...

19:21.440 --> 19:23.410
I'm confused, because it's like...

19:25.180 --> 19:26.850
I've never wanted to go to school,

19:28.620 --> 19:31.250
and now it's like the only thing
I can think about.

19:32.490 --> 19:36.390
Dylan recently learned
his official court date, June 22nd.

19:36.860 --> 19:39.660
He'll be tried as an adult
for felony vandalism.

19:40.430 --> 19:43.970
So, while his classmates are at school,
studying history and math,

19:44.600 --> 19:47.500
he's at home, preparing for his hearing.

19:47.940 --> 19:50.210
I've been watching a lot
of Judge Judy lately,

19:50.540 --> 19:52.710
just, like, kind of prepare and whatnot.

19:53.580 --> 19:57.510
I'm putting all the notes for court
in this notebook.

19:58.250 --> 20:04.850
Like, Judy hates it when, you know,
people chew gum, or text, or whatever.

20:04.920 --> 20:08.360
Or, like, I saw one guy
that started yelling at his wife,

20:08.590 --> 20:11.660
and she was,
like, pretty heated about that.

20:11.730 --> 20:14.600
She starts banging that thing.
You know? Like, I... The...

20:14.660 --> 20:20.240
My main thing for court is,
like, I don't want them to bang the...

20:20.970 --> 20:23.370
I don't want her
to bang that hammer thing.

20:23.440 --> 20:25.570
'Cause I feel like that...
When that happens,

20:25.640 --> 20:30.480
that's when you know, like,
"Fuck, this isn't looking good for me."

20:30.910 --> 20:33.750
Watching Judge Judy
to help prepare for his court hearing

20:34.450 --> 20:37.320
almost makes sense,
in a Dylan sort of way.

20:38.250 --> 20:40.360
Dylan is afraid of his upcoming trial,

20:40.560 --> 20:43.660
because he knows how poorly he came off
in the school board hearing.

20:44.530 --> 20:47.330
He tells me he wasn't nervous,
heading into that hearing.

20:47.400 --> 20:50.270
He was no stranger
to getting into trouble with the school,

20:50.530 --> 20:52.870
but it was always
for something he actually did.

20:53.570 --> 20:56.770
This time, he felt that the system
would prove him innocent.

20:57.510 --> 21:01.040
He didn't realize the school board
had already made up their mind.

21:01.810 --> 21:05.950
He wasn't walking into a trial,
he was walking into an execution.

21:06.550 --> 21:08.920
So, there's...
I mean, there's a voicemail somewhere

21:08.980 --> 21:12.750
of me making the Kiefer Sutherland call.

21:13.390 --> 21:14.860
I can tell you what I was saying.

21:16.390 --> 21:17.360
Please.

21:17.430 --> 21:19.390
Okay. I was like...

21:21.000 --> 21:23.560
I was like, "Janson..."

21:24.930 --> 21:26.770
for both of our safeties,

21:27.070 --> 21:30.340
"I need you
to evacuate the place immediately."

21:34.340 --> 21:35.880
Then that was Kiefer Sutherland?

21:36.640 --> 21:38.480
- I mean, obviously, yeah.
- Okay.

21:39.950 --> 21:46.050
Uh, one of the videos on your YouTube page
I saw was called Nun Humping?

21:46.320 --> 21:47.520
Nun Tree Humping. Yeah.

21:47.590 --> 21:50.960
Oh, my mistake. Nun Tree Humping. Okay.
Do you wanna tell me what that was?

21:51.460 --> 21:55.700
Um, yeah. It's kind of like,
we just dress up as nuns,

21:55.760 --> 21:58.930
and, uh... hump trees.

22:02.770 --> 22:06.870
Another one I saw
was called, um, Baby Farting.

22:07.010 --> 22:10.650
Uh, would you like to tell the members
of the school board what Baby Farting was?

22:10.910 --> 22:16.450
Uh, yeah, that was just, like, one of
the more classic, uh, pranks that we do,

22:16.820 --> 22:20.120
where we'll just kind of go to a park,
or just another... A public place.

22:20.760 --> 22:25.060
Find, you know, a baby, toddler,

22:25.790 --> 22:29.100
and just, like, fart on them.

22:50.890 --> 22:53.120
- Which one are you trying on?
- The dark gray one.

22:53.590 --> 22:55.420
- What?
- The dark gray one.

22:55.490 --> 22:58.460
Why are you mumbling?
You gotta get ready for court, so, just...

22:58.530 --> 22:59.790
Mom, it's charcoal.

22:59.860 --> 23:02.000
It's a charcoal-colored suit, Mom.

23:02.660 --> 23:06.000
Okay. Um, what was the price
on that charcoal one again?

23:06.730 --> 23:07.800
Two twenty-five.

23:13.910 --> 23:15.010
Oh.

23:15.540 --> 23:16.680
That's a lot better.

23:16.740 --> 23:19.080
Yeah. That looks really nice.

23:19.680 --> 23:20.550
That's good.

23:23.020 --> 23:24.420
Tuck in the shirt, sweetie.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.990
I just always thought
my first suit would be for, like...

23:28.460 --> 23:32.060
high-school graduation,
or, like, something sick,

23:32.130 --> 23:37.530
like the Winter X Games,
or like the regular X Games.

23:38.470 --> 23:39.900
Or, like, my funeral.

23:41.470 --> 23:43.040
Not for lame-ass court.

23:43.870 --> 23:46.810
No.
Too bright for court. That's...

23:49.110 --> 23:50.850
Look at you, huh?

23:51.550 --> 23:54.980
You know who you look like?
You look like 007.

23:55.050 --> 23:56.080
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

23:56.150 --> 23:57.650
Did you hear that, Denise?

23:57.820 --> 24:00.560
Said he looked like 007,
'cause he's so handsome.

24:00.620 --> 24:03.860
Pete, why are you even filming this, dude?
It just keeps getting worse.

24:03.930 --> 24:06.890
Dude, if you can't shoot this at school,
and you're suspended,

24:06.960 --> 24:09.860
then why are you even still doing this?
It's over.

24:10.600 --> 24:13.500
Dude, no, it's not, okay?
I'm doing the best I can.

24:13.570 --> 24:15.840
Are you?
You're really doing the best you can?

24:15.900 --> 24:19.170
You're just gonna let them shut you up?
Just gonna let them suspend you?

24:19.840 --> 24:20.980
No, I'm not gonna...

24:25.510 --> 24:26.680
I'll figure something out.

24:27.780 --> 24:29.950
A gag order
has been placed on a local student

24:30.020 --> 24:32.650
at Hanover High School,
shining a light on censorship.

24:33.090 --> 24:36.020
Sophomore Peter Maldonado's documentary,
which has gone viral,

24:36.090 --> 24:37.930
has been shut down by the high school.

24:38.560 --> 24:41.530
Classmates argue
that the ban violates free-speech rights.

24:41.700 --> 24:43.730
The school sees it differently.

24:43.800 --> 24:47.500
I set out to tell a story, a story
that a lot of people really do care about,

24:47.900 --> 24:51.010
but it's obvious that the administration
doesn't want it to get out.

24:51.070 --> 24:54.540
I think it's totally unfair
to call it a distraction.

24:54.680 --> 24:58.050
Sure, people are taking notice,
and students are engaging,

24:58.110 --> 25:00.780
but it's not distracting students
from doing their work,

25:00.850 --> 25:03.120
I think
that's the administration's excuse.

25:03.180 --> 25:05.990
At the center
of Peter Maldonado's documentary

25:06.050 --> 25:07.090
is Dylan Maxwell,

25:07.150 --> 25:09.190
a student expelled for vandalism.

25:09.260 --> 25:12.160
Peter's film questions
whether or not he committed the crime.

25:12.230 --> 25:14.760
It just sucks
that the school's being so unfair.

25:15.760 --> 25:18.870
They shouldn't do that to Peter.
He doesn't deserve that.

25:18.930 --> 25:22.100
The school has refused to
comment on accusations of censorship...

25:29.240 --> 25:34.120
When American Vandal went viral,
I considered the attention a distraction,

25:34.320 --> 25:36.820
something that closed more doors
than it opened.

25:37.050 --> 25:39.750
That attention was the reason
we got shut down.

25:40.790 --> 25:43.860
But it also had the potential
to be the reason we got back up.

25:45.760 --> 25:50.670
Seeing the buzz our documentary got,
local news returned my call immediately.

25:51.230 --> 25:54.270
After their report
and a series of online petitions,

25:54.670 --> 25:57.640
Keene agreed to meet with my mother and I,
about my suspension.

25:58.770 --> 26:00.340
What went on in there, dude?
Tell me.

26:00.610 --> 26:03.140
Dude, you have no idea.
My mom was like a straight savage.

26:03.210 --> 26:05.810
She went in on him, dude.
Like, you have no idea.

26:05.880 --> 26:08.180
Not only did I get reinstated
immediately...

26:08.250 --> 26:09.850
- It was like I had...
- Whoo!

26:09.920 --> 26:10.990
What's up, man?

26:11.050 --> 26:12.850
...the documentary did, as well.

26:13.320 --> 26:16.690
Furthermore,
Keene agreed to give us full access

26:16.760 --> 26:19.730
to the hard copies
of the school's faculty complaint files,

26:19.890 --> 26:22.700
which may finally lead us
to the vandal's target.

26:23.700 --> 26:25.700
My call for help was a success,

26:25.830 --> 26:28.040
but there's still plenty of work
to be done.

26:28.600 --> 26:32.840
Luckily, one of the many messages
I received in the past 24 hours

26:33.310 --> 26:34.910
got us a lot closer.

26:35.280 --> 26:36.380
Uh, hi, Peter.

26:36.880 --> 26:40.110
So, I'm calling about your documentary.

26:40.180 --> 26:42.280
I can't be involved with it.

26:42.620 --> 26:45.150
I've seen people get in trouble,
people are getting fired,

26:45.220 --> 26:48.020
so, I don't want my name attached
to this at all.

26:48.090 --> 26:54.000
But I have heard that you guys are looking
into Coach Rafferty, and I actually...

26:54.060 --> 26:58.230
I have some information that I know
you guys would be really interested in,

26:58.300 --> 26:59.900
and I wanna help you out.

26:59.970 --> 27:02.970
Uh, again,
I don't wanna be involved with this.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.040
You can't use my name.

27:04.270 --> 27:09.310
But I can, uh, leave you something
on your desk in the TV studio.

27:09.380 --> 27:11.250
I think it'll be a big help to you guys.

27:16.280 --> 27:17.150
Right here.

27:26.360 --> 27:28.000
Bust open your computer. Come on.

27:38.940 --> 27:43.210
This was taken on March 10th,
which was five days before the vandalism.

27:44.450 --> 27:46.810
Damn, Rafferty's office is trashed.

27:52.090 --> 27:54.360
"Stick your dick somewhere else."
