WEBVTT

00:00.771 --> 00:02.033
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.033 --> 00:04.105
IN THERAPY, THE SUBJECT

00:04.105 --> 00:05.506
WAS TOM'S NEW GIRLFRIEND.

00:05.506 --> 00:08.079
WHAT ABOUT SEX?
 NOT YET.

00:08.079 --> 00:11.112
I... (cries)
HE WANTS TO END THE MARRIAGE.

00:11.112 --> 00:12.713
SUSAN WANTED TO QUIT...

00:12.713 --> 00:14.185
MAYBE I'M NOT
A REAL ARTIST.

00:14.185 --> 00:16.647
THIS CLASS HAS BEEN
REALLY GOOD FOR YOU.

00:16.647 --> 00:19.650
BUT DECIDED TO FACE
THE CHALLENGE INSTEAD.

00:19.650 --> 00:20.721
YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING,

00:20.721 --> 00:22.293
AND I'M GONNA PULL IT OUT
OF YOU.

00:22.293 --> 00:25.356
THERE IS A CHANCE THAT YOU MIGHT
ACTUALLY BECOME AN ARTIST.

00:25.356 --> 00:28.659
CARLOS TRIED TO DROWN
HIS GUILT...

00:28.659 --> 00:29.760
CARLOS!

00:29.760 --> 00:31.632
(breathily) HEY, GABY.

00:31.632 --> 00:34.565
AND BEN SHOWED BREE
THE SITE WHERE CONSTRUCTION

00:34.565 --> 00:35.736
WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.208
HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN HERE BEFORE?

00:40.811 --> 00:42.243
ONCE.

00:46.677 --> 00:51.382
(panting)

00:54.225 --> 00:56.056
PARANOIA...

00:57.628 --> 01:01.762
IT'S THE IRRATIONAL FEAR
THAT SOMEONE IS AFTER YOU...

01:01.762 --> 01:06.467
(panting)

01:06.467 --> 01:10.301
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE EXPOSED
AT ANY MOMENT.

01:12.743 --> 01:16.307
PARANOIA CAN SNEAK UP ON YOU...

01:16.307 --> 01:17.778
(gasps) OH!

01:17.778 --> 01:20.711
CAUSING YOU TO STUMBLE
AT EVERY TURN.

01:24.585 --> 01:27.688
AND JUST WHEN YOU THINK
YOU'RE IN THE CLEAR...

01:29.490 --> 01:31.722
AND THE DANGER HAS PASSED...

01:33.164 --> 01:35.196
PARANOIA REMINDS YOU...

01:35.196 --> 01:36.827
GABY?

01:36.827 --> 01:39.230
LYNETTE?

01:39.230 --> 01:43.604
THAT NO PLACE IS TRULY SAFE.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.536
OH, MY GOD.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.883
(whispering)
WHERE'D HE GO? IS HE GONE?

01:52.883 --> 01:55.146
(whispering) FOR NOW,
BUT WE GOTTA HURRY.

01:55.146 --> 01:57.818
I THINK WE'RE CLOSE.
I RECOGNIZE THIS AREA.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.220
GOD,
THIS IS CREEPING ME OUT.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.891
WELL, IT DOESN'T HELP
THAT IT'S HALLOWEEN.

02:00.891 --> 02:03.394
LET'S JUST DIG HIM UP
AND GET THIS OVER WITH.

02:03.394 --> 02:05.125
(Bree) LADIES?

02:05.125 --> 02:06.657
LADIES!

02:06.657 --> 02:08.127
BREE?

02:09.830 --> 02:11.332
BREE?

02:11.332 --> 02:13.764
HONEY? ARE YOU OKAY?

02:15.436 --> 02:17.438
PARANOIA--

02:17.438 --> 02:22.142
IT'S THE IRRATIONAL FEAR
THAT SOMEONE IS AFTER YOU.

02:22.142 --> 02:25.776
BUT EVEN WHEN YOU HOPE
IT ISN'T REAL,

02:25.776 --> 02:28.649
IT CAN STILL SCARE YOU
TO DEATH.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.482
NO!

02:50.271 --> 02:54.945
SUSAN DELFINO HAD ALWAYS
BEEN A GREAT STUDENT.

02:54.945 --> 03:00.651
THAT'S BECAUSE SHE KNEW
HOW TO BE THE TEACHER'S PET.

03:00.651 --> 03:03.284
SOME LIKED GIFTS.

03:03.284 --> 03:07.818
SOME LIKED EXTRA CREDIT.

03:07.818 --> 03:11.962
AND SOME JUST LIKEDHER.

03:13.824 --> 03:15.596
BUT IN HER NEW CLASS,

03:15.596 --> 03:18.569
SUSAN WOULD LEARN
THAT NOT EVERY TEACHER...

03:18.569 --> 03:19.870
HAPPY HALLOWEEN.

03:19.870 --> 03:22.573
WAS IN THE MARKET FOR A PET.

03:22.573 --> 03:24.675
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE
A LITTLE TREAT

03:24.675 --> 03:26.507
COMPLETE WITH CANDY CORN.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.409
WHO DOESN'T LIKE CANDY CORN?

03:33.684 --> 03:35.786
APPARENTLY YOU.

03:36.817 --> 03:39.350
IT APPEARS SOME OF YOU
HAVE REMEMBERED

03:39.350 --> 03:41.492
TODAY IS THE DAY
I SELECT MY INTERN.

03:41.492 --> 03:43.594
OH, IS THAT TODAY?

03:43.594 --> 03:44.725
I HAVE A COMMISSION
DUE TUESDAY,

03:44.725 --> 03:45.926
AND I NEED ALL THE HELP
I CAN GET THIS WEEKEND.

03:45.926 --> 03:49.530
NOW THIS IS OBVIOUSLY
A PRESTIGIOUS HONOR.

03:49.530 --> 03:50.761
THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING.

03:50.761 --> 03:53.233
AND IT WON'T BE AWARDED
BASED ON BROWNNOSING,

03:53.233 --> 03:54.905
BOOTLICKING
OR CUPCAKE MAKING.

03:54.905 --> 03:56.907
THAT ABOUT COVERS
ALL YOUR MOVES.

03:56.907 --> 03:59.840
MY DECISION WILL BE MADE
SOLELY ON TALENT,

03:59.840 --> 04:02.973
EXPERIENCE,
AND WHO IRRITATES ME THE LEAST.

04:02.973 --> 04:04.775
OH, CRAP.

04:04.775 --> 04:06.517
AND THAT'S WHY--STAND UP, AMY.

04:08.679 --> 04:09.950
I'VE CHOSEN...

04:09.950 --> 04:12.323
SUSAN DELFINO.

04:12.323 --> 04:14.525
SIT DOWN, AMY.

04:14.525 --> 04:15.856
THAT WAS FUN.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.288
ME?

04:17.288 --> 04:19.490
MEET ME AT 5:00 TOMORROW.
WE'LL DISCUSS YOUR DUTIES.

04:19.490 --> 04:23.033
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I-I'M SO GRATEFUL.

04:23.033 --> 04:25.436
BUT COULD WE MAKE IT 5:15?
MY SON HAS SOCCER PRACTICE--

04:25.436 --> 04:27.938
I HAVE NO KIDS.

04:27.938 --> 04:29.440
AND HE'S NOT VERY GOOD
SO HE WON'T BE GOING.

04:29.440 --> 04:30.701
SEE YOU AT 5:00.

04:38.649 --> 04:40.651
HEY, BABE. HOW YOU DOING?

04:40.651 --> 04:41.952
FINE.

04:41.952 --> 04:44.284
GOOD.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.857
GREAT.

04:46.857 --> 04:48.459
GLAD TO HEAR IT.
(chuckles nervously)

04:50.891 --> 04:52.323
(sniffs)

04:56.967 --> 04:59.870
WOULD YOU LIKE YOUR OWN CUP?
 (gasps)

04:59.870 --> 05:00.931
SORRY.

05:00.931 --> 05:03.934
JUST...

05:03.934 --> 05:05.876
THAT NIGHT REALLY SCARED
THE HELL OUT OF ME.

05:05.876 --> 05:07.938
SCARED ME, TOO.

05:07.938 --> 05:09.940
YEAH, BUT YOU HAVEN'T
DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

05:09.940 --> 05:11.882
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
CHECK OUT AN A.A. MEETING.

05:11.882 --> 05:13.984
GABY, I'M NOT AN ALCOHOLIC.

05:13.984 --> 05:14.985
TELL THAT TO THE CAB DRIVER
WHO HELPED ME

05:14.985 --> 05:16.817
CARRY YOU INSIDE THE HOUSE.

05:16.817 --> 05:20.090
FINE. IF IT WILL KEEP
YOUR FINGERS OUT OF MY COFFEE,

05:20.090 --> 05:21.091
I'LL GO TO A MEETING.

05:21.091 --> 05:22.523
THANK YOU.

05:24.395 --> 05:26.657
I LOVE YOU. MMM.

05:26.657 --> 05:28.999
WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH THIS,
OKAY?

05:30.761 --> 05:31.962
OH! AND DO ME A FAVOR.

05:31.962 --> 05:33.964
IF IT TURNS OUT
YOUAREAN ALCOHOLIC,

05:33.964 --> 05:36.537
PROMISE YOU WON'T BE
ONE OF THOSE WHINY ONES.

05:45.416 --> 05:47.077
(laughs)
 OKAY, WE GOTTA TALK.

05:47.077 --> 05:50.681
(under breath)
OH, GOD, HE BROUGHT JANE?

05:50.681 --> 05:52.853
(sighs)

05:54.455 --> 05:57.588
HEY, SWEETIE.
HOW WAS YOUR DAD'S?

05:57.588 --> 05:58.589
IT WAS FUN.

05:58.589 --> 05:59.890
GOOD. MWAH.

05:59.890 --> 06:02.793
LOOK.
IT'S MY HALLOWEEN COSTUME.

06:02.793 --> 06:04.034
I'M GONNA BE A SWAN.

06:04.034 --> 06:05.966
(laughs) RIGHT.
HOW ABOUT YOU BE SOMETHING

06:05.966 --> 06:07.938
MOMMY CAN ACTUALLY MAKE,
LIKE A GHOST

06:07.938 --> 06:10.841
OR A 13-YEAR-OLD
AMERICAN TEENAGER?

06:10.841 --> 06:13.944
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE IT.
JANE SAID SHE WOULD.

06:15.946 --> 06:17.878
OF COURSE SHE DID.

06:17.878 --> 06:22.883
WELL, I SHOULD GO THANK HER
FOR HELPING ME TO PARENT YOU.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.685
(scoffs)

06:24.685 --> 06:30.060
JANE, IT'S OKAY. YOU DON'T
HAVE TO STAY IN THE CAR.

06:30.060 --> 06:31.692
OR MAYBE YOU SHOULD.

06:31.692 --> 06:34.865
I MEAN, I DON'T WANNA SHOW
YOU UP WITH MY FANCY SWEATS.

06:34.865 --> 06:36.767
OH, STOP.
YOU LOOK GREAT.

06:36.767 --> 06:38.068
LOOK, I THINK IT'S SWEET
THAT YOU VOLUNTEERED

06:38.068 --> 06:39.900
TO HELP PENNY
MAKE HER COSTUME.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.101
HEY, I HOPE
I DIDN'T OVERSTEP.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.033
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST,
BEFORE MEDICAL SCHOOL,

06:43.033 --> 06:45.135
I DABBLED A BIT
IN FASHION DESIGN.

06:45.135 --> 06:47.638
OF COURSE YOU DID.
 IT'S NOTHING.

06:47.638 --> 06:49.880
COUPLE OF SEMESTERS IN PARIS.

06:49.880 --> 06:52.743
AH,PARIS. C'EST LA PLUS BELLE
VILLE DU MONDE, NO?

06:52.743 --> 06:54.044
OUI. OUI, OUI.YES.

06:54.044 --> 06:55.646
(laughs) SHE'S--

06:55.646 --> 06:56.747
SHE'S TEACHING ME.
(chuckles)

06:56.747 --> 06:58.819
OF COURSE SHE IS.

06:58.819 --> 07:01.552
ANYWAY,
MAKING PENNY'S HALLOWEEN COSTUME

07:01.552 --> 07:03.894
IS SORT OF A...
MOTHER/DAUGHTER TRADITION.

07:03.894 --> 07:06.126
SINCE WHEN?

07:06.126 --> 07:08.929
SINCE ALWAYS.

07:08.929 --> 07:12.603
ACTUALLY, I STARTED IT ALREADY,
AND I DON'T WANT TO OVERSELL,

07:12.603 --> 07:14.104
BUT IT'S GONNA BE PRETTY GREAT.

07:14.104 --> 07:16.036
I'M SORRY.
SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.738
I'M SURE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO
HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

07:17.738 --> 07:21.111
WELL, IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND,
IT'S REALLY NO TROUBLE.

07:21.111 --> 07:22.112
I'VE ALREADY MADE
A BUNCH OF COSTUMES

07:22.112 --> 07:24.144
FOR THE KIDS IN THE CANCER WARD.

07:25.876 --> 07:27.548
(closes door)

07:27.548 --> 07:29.179
OF COURSE SHE DID.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.183
(curtain rings rattle)
 OH, GOD.
YOU'RE CLOSING THE CURTAINS.

07:33.183 --> 07:35.055
THIS CAN'T BE GOOD.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.687
IT ISN'T.
I JUST HEARD THE DETAILS

07:36.687 --> 07:39.229
OF BEN'S LATEST
REAL ESTATE PROJECT.

07:39.229 --> 07:41.091
MOM!
 OH, HONEY, NOT RIGHT NOW.

07:41.091 --> 07:42.092
WE'RE TALKING.

07:42.092 --> 07:43.634
YOU TOLD ME
TO TRY ON MY COSTUME.

07:43.634 --> 07:45.496
YOU SAID YOU'D FIX
THE YOLK.

07:45.496 --> 07:48.038
OH, THIS IS WILL TAKE
TWO SECONDS.
 (sighs)

07:51.101 --> 07:53.043
CELIA'S GOING AS BACON.

07:53.043 --> 07:56.106
THIS WORKS A LOT BETTER
WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER.

07:56.106 --> 07:59.049
SO WHAT WERE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

08:00.981 --> 08:02.613
UM, I WAS JUST TELLING
YOUR MOTHER

08:02.613 --> 08:06.256
A VERY SCARY HALLOWEEN STORY
ABOUT THESE FOUR WITCHES

08:06.256 --> 08:08.919
WHO BURIED A MONSTER
DEEP IN THE WOODS.

08:08.919 --> 08:10.861
COOL.

08:10.861 --> 08:12.092
AND AFTER THEY BURIED
THE MONSTER,

08:12.092 --> 08:13.724
THEY WENT ON
WITH THEIR LIVES

08:13.724 --> 08:16.797
UNTIL THIS BIG, FRIGHTENING
REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER CAME ALONG

08:16.797 --> 08:17.868
AND DECIDED TO BUILD CONDOS

08:17.868 --> 08:19.269
RIGHT WHERE THE MONSTER
WAS BURIED!

08:21.101 --> 08:22.803
OW!
 OH! SORRY, SORRY.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.635
ARE YOU SURE?

08:24.635 --> 08:26.106
YEAH. WITCHES ALWAYS LIE.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.108
NOT THIS WITCH.
 HA.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.209
WELL,
I THINK ONE OF THOSE WITCHES

08:29.209 --> 08:31.782
BETTER GO SEE WHAT SHE CAN DO
TO KILL THE PROJECT.

08:31.782 --> 08:33.013
HOW?!

08:33.013 --> 08:34.845
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S YOUR STORY.

08:34.845 --> 08:36.145
FINE.

08:38.948 --> 08:40.250
(door opens and closes)

08:40.250 --> 08:42.623
YEAH. THAT ACTUALLY WAS
KIND OF A LAME STORY.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.154
IT WASN'T EVEN SCARY.

08:44.154 --> 08:50.030
TRUST ME, HONEY. (whispers)
IT IS REALLY, REALLY SCARY.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.802
(exhales deeply)

08:58.569 --> 09:00.140
(doorbell rings)

09:03.774 --> 09:06.016
HI.

09:06.016 --> 09:07.748
SORRY I'VE BEEN A.W.O.L.
FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS,

09:07.748 --> 09:08.849
BUT, UH, THAT'S ONLY
'CAUSE I--

09:08.849 --> 09:12.182
I'M SORRY. HAVE WE MET?
BEN, IS IT?

09:12.182 --> 09:13.584
I KNOW, I KNOW. I...

09:13.584 --> 09:16.056
I'VE BEEN SWAMPED GETTING
MY NEW PROJECT UNDER WAY.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.328
BUT I WANNA MAKE IT UP
TO YOU.

09:18.328 --> 09:19.690
HOW?

09:19.690 --> 09:22.593
TOMORROW NIGHT, MY PLACE,
DINNER FOR TWO,

09:22.593 --> 09:24.595
COOKED BY ONE.

09:24.595 --> 09:26.897
TOMORROW'S HALLOWEEN.

09:26.897 --> 09:28.168
SO? IT'LL BE FUN.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.240
WE CAN, UH, PASS OUT CANDY
TO TRICK-OR-TREATERS.

09:30.240 --> 09:32.202
AND THEN MAYBE LATER,

09:32.202 --> 09:36.006
WE CAN... TRICK A LITTLE...
TREAT OF OUR...

09:36.006 --> 09:37.708
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
I WAS GOING WITH THAT.

09:37.708 --> 09:40.580
ALL RIGHT, YOU WANT
A DATE WITH ME?

09:40.580 --> 09:42.052
YEAH.

09:42.052 --> 09:43.213
BEG.

09:43.213 --> 09:45.085
EXCUSE ME?

09:45.085 --> 09:47.587
ON YOUR KNEES, SOLDIER.

09:47.587 --> 09:51.591
(chuckles)

09:53.924 --> 09:55.666
(sighs)

09:55.666 --> 09:58.929
RENEE, DEAR, SWEET,
HORRIBLE GIRL,

09:58.929 --> 10:00.971
WOULD YOU DO ME THE HONOR
OF DINING WITH ME

10:00.971 --> 10:03.173
ON THE MORROW?

10:03.173 --> 10:05.605
I WOULD.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.378
(sighs)

10:08.378 --> 10:10.340
WAS THAT REALLY NECESSARY?

10:10.340 --> 10:12.212
IT WAS FOR ME.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.014
I HAD TO MAKE SURE
I WASN'T ROLLING OVER

10:14.014 --> 10:16.647
FOR A GUY WITH A BALD SPOT.

10:19.750 --> 10:25.996
OHH! INTERN SUSAN DELFINO
REPORTING FOR DUTY, SIR.

10:25.996 --> 10:28.759
I WAS WONDERING HOW LONG
IT MIGHT TAKE ME TO REGRET THIS.

10:28.759 --> 10:31.862
WAIT. I JUST WANT TO SAY
HOW HONORED I AM

10:31.862 --> 10:33.633
THAT YOU CHOSE ME.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.736
IT'S NICE TO KNOW THAT WHEN
THE HISTORY OF ART IS WRITTEN,

10:35.736 --> 10:38.809
THERE'LL BE ONE SMALL
FOOTNOTE WITH MY NAME ON IT.

10:38.809 --> 10:41.271
(both chuckle)

10:43.944 --> 10:47.678
SUSAN, JASPER, JASPER, SUSAN.
I'LL PICK HIM UP MONDAY NIGHT.

10:47.678 --> 10:51.181
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
 WELL, HE'S MY SON. YOU'RE
WATCHING HIM FOR THE WEEKEND.

10:51.181 --> 10:55.385
MY EX SAYS HE'S DEATHLY ALLERGIC
TO TREE NUTS, CATS...

10:55.385 --> 10:57.427
AND SOMETHING ELSE.
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

10:57.427 --> 10:59.089
UH, WAIT A--
WAIT A MINUTE. (chuckles)

10:59.089 --> 11:03.894
SO... YOU HAVE A SON?
SOMEBODY MARRIED YOU?

11:03.894 --> 11:05.165
BRIEFLY.
I WAS YOUNG AND NEEDED MONEY.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.897
SHE WAS RICH
AND WANTED A CHILD,

11:06.897 --> 11:08.739
AND NOW ONE WEEKEND A MONTH,

11:08.739 --> 11:11.742
JASPER AND I SPEND
SOME QUALITY TIME TOGETHER.

11:11.742 --> 11:13.043
SEE YOU MONDAY.

11:13.043 --> 11:14.775
UH, WAIT A MINUTE. UM, SO...

11:14.775 --> 11:16.176
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.279
I'M JUST A...
GLORIFIED BABYSITTER.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.711
NO, NO, NO, NO.

11:20.711 --> 11:24.684
AS PER SCHOOL POLICY,
WE'RE CALLING IT AN INTERNSHIP.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.686
THAT WAY, I DON'T HAVE
TO PAY YOU.

11:28.058 --> 11:30.420
(scoffs)

11:30.420 --> 11:32.723
(sighs)

11:36.696 --> 11:39.429
SO, JASPER, LOOKS LIKE
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.

11:39.429 --> 11:40.931
WHAT ARE YOU READING?

11:40.931 --> 11:43.874
"TIPS FOR SURVIVING
A NUCLEAR ATTACK."

11:43.874 --> 11:47.137
THE PEOPLE OF NAGASAKI
NEVER SAW IT COMING.

11:47.137 --> 11:51.081
I KNOW HOW THEY FEEL.

11:51.081 --> 11:54.084
(whirring)

11:56.747 --> 12:00.290
SOBEN AND I
ARE HAVING SEX TOMORROW.

12:00.290 --> 12:02.923
EW. NOT IN FRONT
OF MY KID'S COSTUME.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.756
SORRY. IT'S OUR FIRST TIME.
IT'S KIND OF A BIG DEAL.

12:05.756 --> 12:08.428
FIRST TIME? I THOUGHT SEX
WAS LIKE SHAKING HANDS FOR YOU.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.300
IT IS. I LIKE TO GET IT
OVER WITH EARLY

12:10.300 --> 12:12.002
SO THERE'S NO PRESSURE.

12:12.002 --> 12:17.267
BUT WITH BEN, THERE'S BEEN
ALL THIS BUILDUP, SO...

12:17.267 --> 12:18.738
PRESSURE?

12:18.738 --> 12:19.469
YEAH.

12:19.469 --> 12:23.013
I LIKE HIM... A LOT.

12:23.013 --> 12:24.775
AND I WANT OUR FIRST TIME
TO BE GREAT.

12:24.775 --> 12:26.817
THAT'S SWEET.

12:26.817 --> 12:31.021
THAT'S WHY I GOT SOME SEX DRUGS
IN CHINATOWN.

12:31.021 --> 12:33.023
LESS SWEET.

12:33.023 --> 12:35.185
"WOMAN LOVE FLUID."

12:35.185 --> 12:36.957
I GOTTA PUT SOME TAPE
OVER THAT.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.258
THIS STUFF WORK?

12:38.258 --> 12:40.290
EVEN IF IT ALL IT JACKS UP
IS MY CONFIDENCE,

12:40.290 --> 12:42.262
THAT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.534
OKAY. WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:44.534 --> 12:47.998
THIS LOOKS LIKE A CAT,
RIGHT?

12:50.170 --> 12:53.243
SURE, AFTER IT'S PASSED
THROUGH A COYOTE.

12:53.243 --> 12:54.875
WHAT IS GOING ON?

12:54.875 --> 12:57.848
YOU ALWAYS GO
FOR EASY COSTUMES.

12:57.848 --> 13:00.210
DIDN'T YOU ONCE STAPLE
MATH TESTS TO PENNY'S JEANS

13:00.210 --> 13:02.853
AND SEND HER OUT
AS "SMARTY PANTS"?

13:02.853 --> 13:04.784
YES, BUT THIS YEAR,
TOM'S NEW GIRLFRIEND

13:04.784 --> 13:06.386
OFFERED TO MAKE
PENNY'S COSTUME,

13:06.386 --> 13:08.418
SO I, OF COURSE,
SAID I WOULD.

13:08.418 --> 13:11.892
DAMN, WHY IS THERE NO
CHINESE COSTUME FLUID?

13:11.892 --> 13:13.563
WELL, YOU'RE IN LUCK.

13:13.563 --> 13:16.226
I HAVE A FRIEND IN NEW YORK
THAT IS A COSTUME DESIGNER,

13:16.226 --> 13:18.398
AND HE HAS THREE TONY AWARDS.

13:18.398 --> 13:21.001
AND HE'LL MAKE
MY KID'S CAT OUTFIT?

13:21.001 --> 13:23.333
SADLY, HE'LL DO ANYTHING
FOR CASH.

13:23.333 --> 13:25.135
HE'S A HUGE COKEHEAD.

13:25.135 --> 13:29.579
THAT MEANS HE'LL DO IT FAST,
TOO. THAT'S GREAT!

13:29.579 --> 13:31.181
I-I MEAN, FOR US.

13:31.181 --> 13:34.544
POOR GUY NEEDS HELP. MY THOUGHTS
AND PRAYERS ARE WITH HIM.

13:34.544 --> 13:38.418
(indistinct conversations)

13:38.418 --> 13:39.819
HEY THERE.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.992
IF YOU'RE, UH, HERE FOR
THE MEETING, IT JUST ENDED,

13:41.992 --> 13:44.154
AS I'M SURE YOU CAN TELL
BY THE MASSACRE

13:44.154 --> 13:45.155
AT THE DOUGHNUT BOX.

13:45.155 --> 13:46.196
(chuckles)

13:46.196 --> 13:50.030
AHH. ACTUALLY, I WAS JUST...

13:50.030 --> 13:51.831
REALLY LOOKING
TO TALK TO SOMEBODY.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.865
WELL, I'M ALLEN.
 CARLOS.

13:54.865 --> 13:56.266
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH YOU, CARLOS?

13:56.266 --> 13:58.338
COME ON IN.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.241
OKAY.
 ALL RIGHT.

14:01.241 --> 14:05.045
I, UH...
HAD ALITTLEINCIDENT

14:05.045 --> 14:06.116
A FEW NIGHTS AGO.

14:06.116 --> 14:09.479
UH-HUH.

14:09.479 --> 14:12.883
GOT LOADED... (sighs)
AND I LEFT THE HOUSE,

14:12.883 --> 14:16.426
AND, UH...
I DON'T REMEMBER DOING IT.

14:16.426 --> 14:18.628
UH-HUH, YOU BLACKED OUT,
HUH?

14:18.628 --> 14:20.530
YEAH, I'M SO JEALOUS
OF YOU GUYS.

14:20.530 --> 14:23.063
UH, I WAS ALWAYS CURSED
WITH TOTAL RECALL

14:23.063 --> 14:25.465
OF EVERY HORRIFYING SECOND
OF MY BENDERS.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.367
(both chuckle)

14:27.367 --> 14:29.639
SO HOW OFTEN
DOES THIS HAPPEN?

14:29.639 --> 14:31.371
IT DOESN'T.

14:31.371 --> 14:34.204
I USUALLY DON'T DRINK
THAT MUCH. JUST LATELY.

14:34.204 --> 14:35.976
YEAH? OH.
SO WHAT'S "LATELY"?

14:35.976 --> 14:38.878
I DON'T KNOW.

14:38.878 --> 14:39.879
TWO MONTHS, MAYBE.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.282
SOMETHING HAPPEN
TWO MONTHS AGO?

14:42.282 --> 14:43.613
YOU LOSE YOUR JOB?

14:43.613 --> 14:46.886
DID YOUR WIFE LEAVE YOU?
DOG DIE?

14:49.990 --> 14:51.161
NO.

14:51.161 --> 14:53.463
NOTHING I CAN THINK OF.

14:53.463 --> 14:55.966
HMM.

14:55.966 --> 14:57.367
'CAUSE USUALLY THIS SORT
OF THING IS TRIGGERED

14:57.367 --> 14:59.229
BY SOME KIND
OF TRAUMATIC INCIDENT.

14:59.229 --> 15:02.102
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
THIS WAS SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.573
HEY, I WASN'T TRYING
TO PRY.

15:03.573 --> 15:06.576
ALLEN, THANKS,
BUT I REALLY GOTTA BE GOING.

15:06.576 --> 15:08.608
WAS GOOD MEETING YOU,
CARLOS.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.040
LISTEN, IF, UH,

15:10.040 --> 15:12.642
YOU EVER WANNA TALK,
HERE'S MY CELL.

15:12.642 --> 15:14.414
DAY OR NIGHT,
I'LL PICK UP.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.387
APPRECIATE IT.

15:17.387 --> 15:19.019
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

15:24.554 --> 15:26.096
(bottles rattle)

15:38.408 --> 15:39.609
(blows air)

15:50.280 --> 15:52.252
(sighs)

15:52.252 --> 15:53.984
BREE.

15:53.984 --> 15:55.325
WHAT?
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

15:55.325 --> 16:00.190
I JUST SAW SOME MISCREANTS
THROWING EGGS AT YOUR HOUSE.

16:00.190 --> 16:02.062
I TRIED TO RUN OVER
AND CATCH THEM,

16:02.062 --> 16:04.394
BUT I WAS TOO LATE.

16:04.394 --> 16:06.736
AH, IT'S PROBABLY SOME KIDS
WARMING UP FOR HALLOWEEN.

16:06.736 --> 16:10.200
NO, NO, IT WASN'T KIDS,
AND THEY SHOUTED SOMETHING

16:10.200 --> 16:12.702
UNPLEASANT
ABOUT REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS,

16:12.702 --> 16:15.105
INCLUDING
AN ANTI-AUSTRALIAN SLUR.

16:15.105 --> 16:18.378
UH, I'VE NEVER HEARD
AN ANTI-AUSTRALIAN SLUR.

16:18.378 --> 16:19.979
WHAT WAS IT?

16:19.979 --> 16:22.452
I'D RATHER NOT REPEAT IT.

16:22.452 --> 16:25.655
THE POINT IS, THERE SEEMS TO BE
SOME STRENUOUS OPPOSITION

16:25.655 --> 16:27.187
TO THE CHAPMAN WOODS
DEVELOPMENT,

16:27.187 --> 16:29.089
AND AS YOUR LIAISON,

16:29.089 --> 16:31.391
I THINK YOU SHOULD CONSIDER
RELOCATING IT.

16:31.391 --> 16:32.762
ALL RIGHT.

16:32.762 --> 16:35.495
LET ME CONSIDER IT.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.726
NAH. SCREW 'EM.

16:36.726 --> 16:39.069
EXCUSE ME?

16:39.069 --> 16:42.072
I ALREADY SUNK $100,000
INTO MOVING THIS PROJECT

16:42.072 --> 16:43.103
FROM HAWKINS LAKE,

16:43.103 --> 16:44.774
AND THERE'S NO WAY
I'M DOING IT AGAIN.

16:44.774 --> 16:48.578
WELL... (sighs)
WHAT HAPPENED AT HAWKINS LAKE?

16:48.578 --> 16:53.783
(sighs) WE WERE ALL SET TO GO,
BULLDOZERS AT THE READY,

16:53.783 --> 16:55.515
AND THEN
THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDY

16:55.515 --> 16:59.619
TURNS UP FIVE ENDANGERED
YELLOW-SPOTTED FROGS.

16:59.619 --> 17:00.750
FROGS?

17:00.750 --> 17:03.293
YEAH. THE SLIMY LITTLE BASTARDS
ARE NOW THE PROUD OWNERS

17:03.293 --> 17:05.795
OF 50 ACRES
OF WATERFRONT REAL ESTATE.

17:07.757 --> 17:11.300
I'M JUST CURIOUS. HAVE YOU HAD
YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDY

17:11.300 --> 17:12.662
IN CHAPMAN WOODS YET?

17:12.662 --> 17:14.534
UH, TOMORROW,
BUT I'M NOT WORRIED.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.736
MY GUYS HAVE BEEN
OVER EVERY INCH OF IT.

17:16.736 --> 17:20.069
NOT A MISERABLE AMPHIBIAN
IN SIGHT.

17:20.069 --> 17:22.811
YES.

17:22.811 --> 17:25.815
AND I CAN'T IMAGINE
THAT WOULD CHANGE OVERNIGHT.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.455
THEY'D ACTUALLY STOP

17:35.455 --> 17:37.387
A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT
FOR A FROG?

17:37.387 --> 17:39.759
IF IT'S AN ENDANGERED
YELLOW-SPOTTED FROG, THEY WILL.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.691
NOW COME ON.
HELP ME FIND SOME.

17:41.691 --> 17:44.494
UGH. THINGS CREEP ME OUT.

17:44.494 --> 17:46.166
YOU KNOW THAT STORY

17:46.166 --> 17:48.067
WHERE THE PRINCESS
HAS TO KISS THE FROG,

17:48.067 --> 17:49.539
TURN HIM BACK INTO A PRINCE?
SO NOT WORTH IT.

17:49.539 --> 17:51.471
I DON'T CARE
HOW RICH HIS DAD WAS.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.543
GABY, YOU KNOW WHERE
THEY DON'T HAVE FROGS?

17:53.543 --> 17:55.445
PRISON! WHICH IS WHERE WE'RE
GONNA BE IF WE DON'T PLANT SOME

17:55.445 --> 17:57.547
AT BEN'S CONSTRUCTION SITE.

17:57.547 --> 17:59.209
FINE. I'LL HELP.

17:59.209 --> 18:02.452
OH. SAW ONE. OHH!

18:02.452 --> 18:03.553
(whimpers)

18:03.553 --> 18:06.456
(gasps) OH, IS THAT ONE?

18:06.456 --> 18:07.717
DOES HE HAVE SPOTS
ON HIS LEGS?

18:07.717 --> 18:10.190
(whispers) HE HAS TO HAVE
SPOTS ON HIS LEGS.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.162
WELL, YOU'RE GOOD WITH CRAFTS.
YOU CAN STENCIL SOME ON LATER.

18:12.162 --> 18:14.164
AAH! OHH!

18:14.164 --> 18:15.165
DAMN IT!

18:15.165 --> 18:16.526
(gasps)

18:16.526 --> 18:19.399
THIS IS MORE OF A BOYS THING.
WHY ISN'T CARLOS HERE?

18:19.399 --> 18:21.571
BECAUSE I DIDN'T TELL HIM
ABOUT THE CONSTRUCTION.

18:21.571 --> 18:22.702
WHAT? WHY NOT?

18:22.702 --> 18:24.834
BECAUSE HE'S GOT A LOT
ON HIS PLATE RIGHT NOW.

18:24.834 --> 18:28.508
OR, ACTUALLY, IN HIS GLASS.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.340
HE'S BEEN DRINKING A LOT.

18:30.340 --> 18:33.443
REALLY? DO YOU WANT ME
TO SPEAK TO HIM?

18:33.443 --> 18:36.416
NO. NO. HE'S BEEN GOING
TO A.A. MEETINGS.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.748
HE SAID HE MET A GREAT SPONSOR.
HE'S DOING FINE.

18:38.748 --> 18:40.390
I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND
WHAT HE'S GOING THROUGH.

18:40.390 --> 18:41.551
IT'S KIND OF A MIRACLE

18:41.551 --> 18:44.524
THAT I'VE STAYED SOBER
THROUGH ALL OF THIS.

18:44.524 --> 18:49.359
(whispers) DON'T MOVE.
THERE'S ONE BY YOUR FOOT.

18:50.700 --> 18:54.334
AAH! (screaming)

18:54.334 --> 18:55.335
(sighs)

18:55.335 --> 18:56.336
(water splashes)

18:56.336 --> 18:59.469
THIS IS GONNA BE A LONG DAY.

19:02.572 --> 19:05.645
SO... YOU WANNA PLAY
SOME VIDEO GAMES?

19:05.645 --> 19:07.417
THAT'S ORIGINAL.

19:08.518 --> 19:10.149
(sighs)

19:10.149 --> 19:12.322
OKAY. UM...

19:12.322 --> 19:14.554
SOMETHING MORE CREATIVE.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.326
YOU WANNA CARVE
A JACK-O'-LANTERN?

19:16.326 --> 19:20.190
I'D RATHER STICK
A KNIFE IN MY EYE.

19:20.190 --> 19:23.763
(sighs)
ONLY 36 HOURS TO GO.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.766
37.HE'S ALWAYS LATE.

19:28.698 --> 19:31.671
(robotic voice)
I AM THE CANDY-BOT 3000.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.804
PLEASE GIVE CANDY.

19:34.804 --> 19:37.707
AW, M.J., YOU LOOK AMAZING.
I MEAN...

19:37.707 --> 19:40.580
(robotic voice)
I AM MOM-BOT 3000.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.552
COSTUME APPROVED.

19:42.552 --> 19:43.813
(giggles)

19:43.813 --> 19:45.184
YOU GUYS SOUND STUPID.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.658
YOUR INSULT
DOES NOT COMPUTE.

19:48.658 --> 19:52.492
SHUT UP! NOBODY CARES
ABOUT BEING A DUMB ROBOT!

19:53.663 --> 19:55.725
(door opens and slams)

19:55.725 --> 19:57.627
(sighs)

20:02.332 --> 20:03.873
(sighs)

20:11.781 --> 20:13.543
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:13.543 --> 20:15.845
I JUST HATE
ALL THIS HALLOWEEN STUFF.

20:15.845 --> 20:19.649
HOW CAN YOU HATE A HOLIDAY
THAT'S ALL ABOUT DRESSING UP

20:19.649 --> 20:21.521
AND GETTING FREE CANDY?

20:21.521 --> 20:22.852
IT'S THE BEST DAY
OF THE YEAR.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.701
JASPER, DOES YOUR DAD NOT
LET YOU CELEBRATE HALLOWEEN?

20:31.701 --> 20:35.265
HE SAYS IT'S FOR KIDS.

20:35.265 --> 20:38.768
YOU DO KNOW
YOU'RE A KID, RIGHT?

20:41.571 --> 20:42.942
(scoffs)

20:42.942 --> 20:44.574
OKAY, THAT'S IT.

20:44.574 --> 20:47.917
YOU AND YOUR FATHER ARE COMING
TRICK-OR-TREATING WITH US.

20:47.917 --> 20:50.450
(scoffs)
HE'LL NEVER GO FOR THAT.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.622
OH, YOU JUST LET ME
TALK TO HIM.

20:52.622 --> 20:55.725
I CAN BE PRETTY PERSUASIVE.

20:55.725 --> 20:58.257
I'D RATHER STICK
A KNIFE IN MY EYE.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.590
OH, COME ON. YOUR SON IS DYING
TO GO TRICK-OR-TREATING.

21:00.590 --> 21:02.592
IT'S JUST A COUPLE HOURS.

21:02.592 --> 21:03.863
UNTIL I DELIVER
THESE PAINTINGS,

21:03.863 --> 21:05.835
IT'S THE ONLY THING
I CARE ABOUT.

21:05.835 --> 21:09.539
(brush clatters)
 THAT AND A CIGARETTE.

21:09.539 --> 21:11.371
DON'T LOOK AT THIS.
IT'S NOT DONE.

21:33.523 --> 21:36.426
GABY, WILL YOU STOP
WITH THE SANITIZER?

21:36.426 --> 21:38.598
YOUR HANDS ARE GONNA SLIDE
RIGHT OFF THE WHEEL.

21:38.598 --> 21:39.629
I CAN'T HELP IT.

21:39.629 --> 21:41.501
I CAN STILL FEEL
THOSE SLIMY THINGS

21:41.501 --> 21:43.373
CRAWLING THROUGH MY FINGERS.

21:43.373 --> 21:44.634
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

21:44.634 --> 21:46.836
HOW COME I DON'T HEAR
ANYTHING MOVING IN THAT BOX?

21:46.836 --> 21:48.738
SHOULDN'T THEY BE CROAKING
OR SOMETHING?

21:48.738 --> 21:51.010
MAYBE THEY'RE RESTING.
 (whispers) OR DEAD.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.942
(normal voice) YOU DON'T THINK
THEY'RE DEAD, DO YOU?

21:52.942 --> 21:56.646
OH, GOD! DON'T BRING THAT
IN THE FRONT SEAT.

21:56.646 --> 21:59.649
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.

21:59.649 --> 22:00.990
(croaks)
 (gasps)

22:00.990 --> 22:05.054
ALL RIGHT.
I'M TRYING TO REMAIN CALM.

22:05.054 --> 22:07.557
PLEASE TELL ME THOSE ARE
YOUR LONG-WEBBED FINGERS

22:07.557 --> 22:09.359
ON MY ARM.

22:09.359 --> 22:11.731
GABY, DO NOT PANIC.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.633
(gasps)

22:14.934 --> 22:16.666
(croaks)

22:16.666 --> 22:18.768
AAH! GET IT OFF!

22:18.768 --> 22:19.909
STAY CALM! STAY CALM!

22:19.909 --> 22:22.341
(screaming)
 DON'T PANIC!

22:22.341 --> 22:24.814
WATCH THE ROAD!
 OH, GOD!
I THINK IT'S ON MY LEG!

22:24.814 --> 22:26.015
(tires screeching)
 STOP SWERVING!

22:26.015 --> 22:27.817
I'M TRYING TO GET
THE LID BACK ON!

22:27.817 --> 22:30.349
GET IT OFF ME!
 CAREFUL! IT'S CRAWLING
UNDER THE BRAKE PEDAL!

22:30.349 --> 22:31.821
NOT ANYMORE!

22:31.821 --> 22:33.553
(brakes squeal)

22:33.553 --> 22:37.356
(both screaming)

22:37.356 --> 22:39.959
(croaking)
 OH, THEY'RE GETTING AWAY!
THEY'RE SO FAST!

22:39.959 --> 22:41.861
WHAT THE HELL COULD
ENDANGERTHEM?!

22:41.861 --> 22:46.666
OHH! DETAILING IS NEVER
GONNA GET THAT OUT!

22:55.374 --> 22:57.547
(turns off engine)

22:57.547 --> 22:58.578
(sighs)

22:58.578 --> 23:00.049
WE'RE SO SCREWED.

23:00.049 --> 23:02.482
WILL YOU PLEASE STOP
SAYING THAT?

23:02.482 --> 23:05.014
IN 12 HOURS, THOSE BULLDOZERS
ARE GONNA BREAK GROUND.

23:05.014 --> 23:06.586
I THINK THE PHRASE
"WE ARE SO SCREWED"

23:06.586 --> 23:08.458
CANNOT BE SAID ENOUGH.

23:08.458 --> 23:09.689
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
WE CAN DO.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.591
THEY'RE GONNA FIND
ALEJANDRO'S BODY.

23:11.591 --> 23:12.992
THEY'LL--THEY'LL DO
AN INVESTIGATION.

23:12.992 --> 23:15.895
THEY'LL LEARN
HE'S MY STEPFATHER.

23:15.895 --> 23:16.896
UNLESS...

23:16.896 --> 23:18.998
(sighs) UNLESS WHAT?

23:21.801 --> 23:23.803
THERE'S NO BODY
TO BE FOUND.

23:35.184 --> 23:37.116
MOM, I NEED MY CAT COSTUME.

23:37.116 --> 23:39.088
DAD AND JANE
WILL BE HERE SOON.

23:39.088 --> 23:41.651
(singsongy) I'M JUST PUTTING ON
THE FINISHING TOUCHES.

23:41.651 --> 23:45.555
(normal voice, lowered)
THE TRACKING NUMBER IS JHKWRXA.

23:45.555 --> 23:47.426
I'M NOT SURE WHY
THE TRACKING NUMBERS

23:47.426 --> 23:50.199
ARE ALL LETTERS,
BUT IT'S YOUR SYSTEM, SO--
 (vehicle approaches)

23:50.199 --> 23:52.902
OH, FORGET IT, FORGET IT.
THERE HE IS.
 (beep)

23:52.902 --> 23:54.704
(hushed voice) HEY! PSST!

23:54.704 --> 23:58.167
UP HERE! UP HERE!
DON'T--DON'T RING THE DOORBELL.

23:58.167 --> 23:59.469
I JUST PUT MY BABY DOWN
FOR A NAP.

23:59.469 --> 24:01.911
TOSS THE PACKAGE UP HERE.

24:01.911 --> 24:04.844
I'LL CATCH IT.
I HAVE THREE SONS. COME ON!

24:04.844 --> 24:07.016
(sighs)

24:12.221 --> 24:14.123
NICE.

24:21.691 --> 24:23.633
I CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER.
LET ME SEE.

24:23.633 --> 24:25.134
MM! (spits)

24:25.134 --> 24:27.166
FINISHED. ALL YOURS.

24:27.166 --> 24:28.467
THANKS, MOM.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.600
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU MADE THIS
ALL BY YOURSELF.

24:30.600 --> 24:33.472
MRS. SCAVO!
I NEED A SIGNATURE!

24:33.472 --> 24:35.975
LET'S GO TRY IT ON.
COME ON.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.046
OKAY.
 GO, GO.

24:39.008 --> 24:40.109
(exhales deeply)

24:40.109 --> 24:41.480
(children shouting playfully)

24:41.480 --> 24:43.753
I'M JUST SAYING
YOU ARE ONE GOOD WIG

24:43.753 --> 24:47.156
AWAY FROM BEING
A FANTASTIC COWARDLY LION.

24:47.156 --> 24:48.658
DROP IT, WITCH.

24:48.658 --> 24:51.490
JUST SAY IT FOR ME ONCE.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.792
(as "Cowardly Lion")
"IDOBELIEVE IN SPOOKS.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.824
I DO, I DO,
I DO BELIEVE IN SPOOKS."

24:54.824 --> 24:57.096
LOOK, I'M ONLY HERE BECAUSE
YOU KIDNAPPED MY PAINTING.

24:57.096 --> 24:59.028
THE RANSOM WAS TWO HOURS
OF TRICK-OR-TREATING,

24:59.028 --> 25:00.570
NO COSTUME, NO CHITCHAT.

25:00.570 --> 25:02.231
(sighs)
 ALL I'M DOING
IS COUNTING THE MINUTES

25:02.231 --> 25:04.904
TILL I CAN GET BACK
TO WORK.

25:06.606 --> 25:07.877
SCORE. CHECK IT OUT.

25:07.877 --> 25:10.239
THEY HAD
GIANT PEANUT BUTTER CUPS.

25:10.239 --> 25:11.711
NICE GOING, SWEETIE.
(laughs)

25:11.711 --> 25:14.283
I GOT A CHOCOLATE BOMB.
YOU WANT SOME?

25:14.283 --> 25:16.185
NO, THANKS, PAL.
WHAT I WANT IS TO GO.

25:16.185 --> 25:19.188
BUT WE'VE ONLY DONE
HALF THE STREET.

25:19.188 --> 25:21.651
OKAY, WELL, TELL YOU WHAT.

25:21.651 --> 25:23.593
WHAT IF WE LEAVE NOW,
AND I'LL GIVE YOU 20 BUCKS?

25:23.593 --> 25:25.154
YOU CAN BUY
ALL THE CANDY YOU LIKE.

25:25.154 --> 25:28.527
YOUR FATHER'S JUST MESSING
WITH YOU. RUN ON AHEAD.

25:28.527 --> 25:31.230
I PROMISE I'LL GO FAST,
ANDRE.

25:31.230 --> 25:33.733
HE CALLS YOU "ANDRE"?

25:33.733 --> 25:35.635
OH, YEAH, I PREFER IT.

25:35.635 --> 25:37.236
"DAD" ISN'T
AN ACCURATE CHARACTERIZATION

25:37.236 --> 25:39.969
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP.

25:39.969 --> 25:41.811
HE'S YOUR SON.

25:41.811 --> 25:43.613
HE'SHERSON.

25:43.613 --> 25:45.314
BIOLOGICALLY, HE'S YOURS.

25:45.314 --> 25:47.747
ONTOLOGICALLY, HE'S GETTING
IN THE WAY OF MY WORK.

25:47.747 --> 25:50.950
WELL, PSYCHOLOGICALLY,
YOU'RE A FREAKIN' SOCIOPATH.

25:50.950 --> 25:53.552
DO YOU SEE
HOW DESPERATELY THAT BOY

25:53.552 --> 25:54.724
IS TRYING TO CONNECT
WITH YOU?

25:54.724 --> 25:57.186
AND YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN
TO PUSH HIM AWAY.

25:57.186 --> 25:59.088
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN THE RELATIONSHIP.

25:59.088 --> 26:02.161
TOUGH.

26:02.161 --> 26:05.234
I MEAN, HE'S NOT A NOVEL
YOU CAN JUST TOSS ASIDE

26:05.234 --> 26:06.936
IF IT'S BORING.

26:06.936 --> 26:08.968
OR A PAINTING
YOU JUST WALK PAST

26:08.968 --> 26:10.670
'CAUSE IT'S NOT INTERESTING.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.872
HE'S A PERSON WITH FEELINGS.

26:12.872 --> 26:16.876
OKAY, JUST KEEP GOING. THIS IS
REALLY MAKING THE TIME FLY BY.

26:16.876 --> 26:19.048
(sighs)

26:19.048 --> 26:23.783
I HAVE SPENT THE LAST FEW WEEKS
TRYING TO GET YOU TO LIKE ME,

26:23.783 --> 26:27.617
AND I JUST REALIZED SOMETHING.
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

26:29.659 --> 26:31.190
YOUR PAINTING IS
IN THE UTILITY CLOSET

26:31.190 --> 26:33.863
NEXT TO YOUR CLASSROOM.

26:33.863 --> 26:36.365
GO TAKE CARE
OF YOUR MASTERPIECE.

26:36.365 --> 26:38.267
I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOUR SON.

26:43.903 --> 26:45.274
HI.

26:45.274 --> 26:48.277
THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME
TAG ALONG TRICK-OR-TREATING.

26:48.277 --> 26:51.280
CHLOE'S 20 NOW, SO I'M NOSTALGIC
FOR THINGS LIKE THIS.

26:51.280 --> 26:52.982
AW, YOU'RE LUCKY.
MY OLDER KIDS

26:52.982 --> 26:56.045
ARE 20 AS WELL, BUT THIS ONE
KEPT KNOCKING ME UP

26:56.045 --> 26:59.088
SO NOW I WON'T GET TO BE
NOSTALGIC UNTIL I'M 90.

26:59.088 --> 27:01.350
(chuckles)

27:01.350 --> 27:04.694
SO... IS PENNY READY? 'CAUSE WE
GOTTA GET TO THE McALLISTERS'

27:04.694 --> 27:06.625
BEFORE THEY RUN OUT
OF POPCORN BALLS.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.698
SHE'S JUST PUTTING ON
HER COSTUME...

27:08.698 --> 27:11.060
THAT I SEWED
WITH MY HANDS,

27:11.060 --> 27:12.631
AND I'M PRETTY PROUD OF IT.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.904
(Penny) MOM!

27:14.904 --> 27:17.406
THIS IS AMAZING.

27:17.406 --> 27:20.269
LOOK. I'M A KITTEN
WITH A WHIP.

27:20.269 --> 27:22.111
(whip cracks)

27:22.111 --> 27:24.914
MEOW.

27:24.914 --> 27:27.276
THIS IS JUST

27:27.276 --> 27:29.418
IN CASE SHE'S ATTACKED
BY DOGS.

27:29.418 --> 27:31.250
YOU'RE PROUD OF THIS?

27:31.250 --> 27:35.124
YEP.
I THOUGHT IT WAS CUTE.

27:35.124 --> 27:38.327
YEAH, IF SHE'S TRICK-OR-TREATING
FOR DOLLAR BILLS!

27:38.327 --> 27:41.090
IT'S COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE!

27:41.090 --> 27:42.862
HONEY, GO BACK UPSTAIRS

27:42.862 --> 27:44.663
AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND
THOSE "SMARTY PANTS."

27:44.663 --> 27:47.937
DO I HAVE TO?

27:47.937 --> 27:51.841
PENNY, ARE YOU SURE YOU PUT
THE WHOLE COSTUME ON?

27:51.841 --> 27:53.442
I THINK SO.

27:53.442 --> 27:55.204
THERE WASN'T A SKIRT
THAT WENT WITH IT?

27:55.204 --> 27:57.406
'CAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE A SKIRT
WAS A PART OF THAT PATTERN.

27:57.406 --> 27:59.408
RIGHT?

27:59.408 --> 28:02.081
YEAH, YEAH. THERE WAS.

28:02.081 --> 28:06.756
WELL, I'D BET I COULD HELP YOU
FIND THAT SKIRT YOUR MOM MADE.

28:06.756 --> 28:10.059
I BET YOU COULD.

28:11.761 --> 28:13.092
GO ON.

28:20.099 --> 28:21.300
(sighs)

28:24.373 --> 28:26.135
(sighs)

28:29.038 --> 28:30.780
(liquid drops)

28:30.780 --> 28:31.911
(exhales deeply)

28:42.091 --> 28:45.054
(sighs)

28:45.054 --> 28:46.195
(liquid drops)

28:47.797 --> 28:49.498
(liquid drops)

28:49.498 --> 28:52.301
(exhales deeply)

28:58.107 --> 28:59.068
(doorbell rings)

28:59.068 --> 29:01.210
(children, singsongy)
TRICK OR TREAT?!

29:01.210 --> 29:02.912
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

29:02.912 --> 29:05.114
(both breathing heavily)

29:11.280 --> 29:13.222
(children) TRICK OR TREAT?!

29:13.222 --> 29:15.454
WHAT AMAZING COSTUMES.

29:15.454 --> 29:17.186
NOW DON'T GET ME WITH YOUR HOOK.

29:17.186 --> 29:19.989
AND LOOK AT YOU. AREN'T YOU
THE PRETTIEST LITTLE PRINCESS

29:19.989 --> 29:22.031
IN THE WHOLE... WORLD...

29:22.031 --> 29:23.062
(candy clatters)

29:23.062 --> 29:26.435
UH...

29:26.435 --> 29:29.999
NOW... LET'S SEE IF WE CAN
FIND SOMETHING "FUN SIZE"

29:29.999 --> 29:32.071
FOR ME TO ENJOY.

29:32.071 --> 29:35.074
(laughs)

29:35.074 --> 29:38.077
(both moaning)

29:42.952 --> 29:46.385
WHOA! (gasps)
IS IT, UH...

29:46.385 --> 29:47.516
IS IT HOT IN HERE?

29:47.516 --> 29:49.418
UH... DON'T THINK SO.

29:49.418 --> 29:50.519
OKAY.

29:50.519 --> 29:55.024
MAYBE I SHOULD, UH,
TAKE OFF A LAYER.

29:55.024 --> 29:56.065
(chuckles)

29:56.065 --> 30:01.230
(breathing heavily)

30:01.230 --> 30:03.072
MMM.

30:03.072 --> 30:04.904
(makes hacking sound)

30:04.904 --> 30:07.106
YOU ALL RIGHT?

30:07.106 --> 30:09.138
I'M NOT SURE.
I'VE GOT THIS...

30:09.138 --> 30:12.511
(clears throat)
THIS TIGHTNESS IN MY THROAT.

30:12.511 --> 30:15.214
YEAH, AND YOUR EYES LOOK
A LITTLE GLASSY.
 (panting)

30:15.214 --> 30:16.815
UH, YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

30:16.815 --> 30:18.217
WE CAN DO THIS
ANOTHER NIGHT, YOU KNOW.

30:18.217 --> 30:21.190
NO, NO, NO.
I'M FINE, REALLY.

30:21.190 --> 30:26.926
NOW... GET OVER HERE,
BIG MAN. (laughs)

30:26.926 --> 30:28.898
(sighs)

30:28.898 --> 30:31.460
(makes loud hacking sound)

30:36.005 --> 30:38.437
WHAT ABOUT THE HOUSE WITH
THE SPIDERWEBS AND THE BATS?

30:38.437 --> 30:40.109
THAT DIDN'T SCARE YOU?

30:40.109 --> 30:44.343
NAH, IT TAKES A LOT MORE
THAN THAT TO SCARE ME. AAH!

30:44.343 --> 30:46.075
(Susan gasps)

30:46.075 --> 30:47.546
HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

30:47.546 --> 30:49.218
THIS WAS UNDER THE MAT.

30:49.218 --> 30:51.220
IT'S A GREAT HIDING PLACE,
BY THE WAY.

30:51.220 --> 30:52.882
HAD ME STUMPED
FOR A GOOD FOUR SECONDS.

30:52.882 --> 30:54.483
MOMMY?

30:54.483 --> 30:56.225
CAN WE GO TRADE CANDY?

30:56.225 --> 30:57.386
WELL, YOU'LL HAVE TO ASK
JASPER'S...

30:57.386 --> 30:59.889
ANDRE.

30:59.889 --> 31:02.091
YEAH, IT'S FINE.

31:02.091 --> 31:04.063
ALL RIGHT.
 YEAH.

31:04.063 --> 31:07.196
THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA FINISH YOUR PAINTING.

31:07.196 --> 31:08.267
I WILL.

31:08.267 --> 31:10.469
BUT I WAS THINKING
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID.

31:10.469 --> 31:12.541
AND YOU REALIZED
THE ERROR OF YOUR WAYS

31:12.541 --> 31:14.073
AND CAME TO TELL ME THAT?

31:14.073 --> 31:17.576
GOD. IS THAT HOW THINGS
WORK IN YOUR WORLD?

31:17.576 --> 31:22.181
LOOK, I GET YOU DON'T LIKE ME.
MOST PEOPLE DON'T.

31:22.181 --> 31:26.055
I'VE LEARNED TO LIVE WITH THAT
MAINLY BY NOT CARING.

31:26.055 --> 31:28.357
OH. I THINK YOU CARE.

31:28.357 --> 31:30.419
I SWEAR TO GOD I DON'T.

31:30.419 --> 31:32.421
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,
SUSAN.

31:32.421 --> 31:34.323
MY WORK IS ALWAYS
GONNA COME FIRST.

31:34.323 --> 31:37.366
EVEN BEFORE JASPER?

31:37.366 --> 31:40.229
THAT'S WHAT I WAS GETTING TO.
I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID.

31:40.229 --> 31:42.371
HE IS MY SON.

31:42.371 --> 31:45.204
AND I'M GONNA TRY
TO BE A BETTER DAD.

31:45.204 --> 31:48.938
WELL, I BET IT'LL MAKE YOU
A BETTER PAINTER.

31:48.938 --> 31:51.540
I BET IT WON'T.

31:51.540 --> 31:54.343
YOU NEED TO KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT BEING A TRUE ARTIST.

31:54.343 --> 31:59.048
THIS--THIS GIFT,
THIS CURSE, WHATEVER IT IS--

31:59.048 --> 32:02.091
IT CONSUMES YOU
AND BLOTS OUT EVERYTHING ELSE--

32:02.091 --> 32:05.294
FRIENDS, FAMILY, EVERYTHING.

32:05.294 --> 32:11.160
I WOULD NEVER LET
THAT HAPPEN TO ME.

32:11.160 --> 32:14.303
YOU MAY NOT HAVE A CHOICE.

32:18.507 --> 32:21.210
(door opens and closes)

32:21.210 --> 32:23.442
(doorbell rings)

32:23.442 --> 32:25.614
(children) TRICK OR...

32:25.614 --> 32:27.546
(screaming)

32:33.352 --> 32:36.355
THAT'S WEIRD. THEY DIDN'T EVEN
WAIT FOR THE CANDY.

32:36.355 --> 32:38.387
HOW'S DINNER COMING?

32:38.387 --> 32:40.389
OH, IT'S JUST ABOUT R--
OH, MY GOD.

32:40.389 --> 32:41.660
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

32:41.660 --> 32:44.033
WHAT?

32:44.033 --> 32:45.534
YOU NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR.

32:45.534 --> 32:48.737
OH. OVER THIS LITTLE RASH?
DON'T BE SILLY.

32:48.737 --> 32:52.371
NOW STAND STILL.
STOP RUNNING IN CIRCLES.

32:52.371 --> 32:54.403
I'M NOT MOVING.

32:54.403 --> 32:56.075
OH, THAT'S NOT GOOD.

32:56.075 --> 32:57.546
(glasses clatter)

32:57.546 --> 33:00.179
YOU KNOW,
O-ON SECOND THOUGHT,

33:00.179 --> 33:02.311
I'M NOT REALLY FEELING
VERY...

33:02.311 --> 33:04.983
OH, OKAY. (laughs) OKAY.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.556
DEFINITELY TIME
FOR A DOCTOR.

33:07.556 --> 33:11.320
(children screaming)

33:16.295 --> 33:18.367
(whirring)
 ALMOST FINISHED.

33:18.367 --> 33:21.170
WOW, FROM CATHOUSE TO HOUSE CAT
IN TEN MINUTES.

33:21.170 --> 33:22.571
YOU COULD DO THIS
PROFESSIONALLY.

33:22.571 --> 33:25.634
YOU MEAN LIKE THE PERSON
WHO MADE IT?

33:25.634 --> 33:30.239
YEAH. I MAY HAVE...

33:30.239 --> 33:32.511
SLIGHTLY OVEREXAGGERATED
MY SEWING SKILLS.

33:32.511 --> 33:35.484
I GUESS... I WAS FEELING...

33:35.484 --> 33:37.316
(sighs)

33:37.316 --> 33:38.317
THIS IS NEW FOR ME.

33:38.317 --> 33:41.350
IT'S NEW FOR ME, TOO.

33:41.350 --> 33:42.751
YOU GONNA BUST ME?

33:42.751 --> 33:44.323
FOR TRYING TO LOOK GOOD?

33:44.323 --> 33:47.626
LYNETTE, WHEN MY HUSBAND LEFT ME
FOR OUR SWEDISH AU PAIR,

33:47.626 --> 33:50.499
I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT
MY DAUGHTER A CAR.

33:50.499 --> 33:51.760
SHE WAS 13.

33:51.760 --> 33:55.033
(gasps)
WELL, THEN IT'S OFFICIAL.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.206
YOU'RE BETTER AT EVERYTHING,
EVEN BRIBERY.

33:57.206 --> 34:00.469
PLEASE.YOU HAD A CAREER
AND RAISED FIVE KIDS.

34:00.469 --> 34:02.411
I COULD BARELY
KEEP IT TOGETHER WITH ONE.

34:02.411 --> 34:03.512
WHO SAYS I KEPT IT TOGETHER?

34:03.512 --> 34:05.714
I THINK
YOU'RE DOING PRETTY GREAT.

34:05.714 --> 34:08.377
YOU'RE SMART, CONFIDENT.

34:08.377 --> 34:11.280
IN FACT, THIS MIGHT SOUND
A LITTLE WEIRD,

34:11.280 --> 34:14.683
BUT... YOU SEEM LIKE THE KIND OF
PERSON I COULD BE FRIENDS WITH.

34:17.186 --> 34:18.487
IT DOESN'T SOUND WEIRD.

34:18.487 --> 34:22.291
BEFORE, WHEN YOU SAVED
MY ASS OUT THERE,

34:22.291 --> 34:24.333
THAT WAS THE KIND OF THING
A FRIEND DOES.

34:24.333 --> 34:26.565
HAPPY TO HELP.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.536
(scissors snips)

34:28.536 --> 34:30.068
THEN...

34:33.302 --> 34:35.744
CAN I ASK YOU TO HELP ME
WITH SOMETHING ELSE?

34:35.744 --> 34:38.306
SURE.

34:38.306 --> 34:39.378
YOU THINK MAYBE
YOU COULD STOP

34:39.378 --> 34:41.480
TRYING TO TAKE MY HUSBAND
AWAY FROM ME?

34:41.480 --> 34:44.152
WHAT?

34:44.152 --> 34:47.616
YOUR MARRIAGE ENDED.
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS FEELS LIKE.

34:47.616 --> 34:51.320
WHOA. WHOA.
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

34:51.320 --> 34:53.492
THE CIRCUMSTANCES
WERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

34:53.492 --> 34:56.225
MAYBE THEY WERE.

34:56.225 --> 34:57.866
BUT YOU STILL KNOW
HOW IT HURTS.

34:57.866 --> 35:00.329
SO I'M ASKING YOU,
PLEASE,

35:00.329 --> 35:02.431
BACK OFF.

35:02.431 --> 35:03.572
OKAY?

35:03.572 --> 35:06.535
YOU THINK
I'M GONNA GIVE UP ON HIM

35:06.535 --> 35:08.877
JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN'T ACCEPT
YOUR MARRIAGE IS OVER?

35:08.877 --> 35:13.182
WE HAVE FIVE KIDS.

35:13.182 --> 35:14.583
ONE OF THEM IS JUST A BABY.

35:14.583 --> 35:16.885
I'M NOT LETTING MY HUSBAND GO
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

35:16.885 --> 35:20.819
WELL, ACCORDING TO TOM, YOU'RE
ALWAYS LOOKING FOR A FIGHT.

35:20.819 --> 35:23.121
MY EX WAS LIKE THAT, TOO.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.594
YOU KNOW, AND WHEN YOU FIND
SOMEBODY WHO ISN'T,

35:25.594 --> 35:27.526
YOU WANNA HANG ON TO THEM.

35:34.833 --> 35:36.435
YOU SHOULD GIVE THIS
TO PENNY.

35:48.377 --> 35:49.618
OKAY, THE GIRLS ARE ASLEEP.
LISTEN FOR THE DOORBELL

35:49.618 --> 35:51.420
IN CASE THERE ARE SOME
LATE TRICK-OR-TREATERS.

35:51.420 --> 35:53.422
I KNOW THE DRILL.

35:53.422 --> 35:55.554
OH, AND DON'T WAIT UP FOR ME.
I'LL BE LATE.

35:55.554 --> 35:58.457
WE'RE TAKING LYNETTE OUT
FOR A DRINK.

35:58.457 --> 35:59.658
OH. SORRY.

35:59.658 --> 36:02.160
I'M FINE, GABY.

36:02.160 --> 36:05.264
IT'S JUST HER FIRST HOLIDAY
WITHOUT TOM AND THE KIDS,

36:05.264 --> 36:06.535
SO WE WANNA GIVE HER
A FUN NIGHT OUT,

36:06.535 --> 36:07.896
YOU KNOW,
TO BOOST HER SPIRITS.

36:07.896 --> 36:10.239
(chuckles)

36:10.239 --> 36:12.741
(whispers) BYE.

36:12.741 --> 36:17.406
WE'RE DIGGING UP THE BODY
TONIGHT?

36:17.406 --> 36:18.747
WE HAVE NO CHOICE.

36:18.747 --> 36:21.250
BEN'S BULLDOZERS START TEARING
UP THE WOODS TOMORROW MORNING.

36:21.250 --> 36:23.782
WHERE ARE CARLOS AND SUSAN?

36:23.782 --> 36:25.654
CARLOS IS NOT
IN A GOOD PLACE RIGHT NOW.

36:25.654 --> 36:27.416
I DIDN'T WANNA
FREAK HIM OUT.

36:27.416 --> 36:29.788
AND SUSAN HAS DONE NOTHING
 BUTFREAK OUT, SO IT'S JUST US.

36:29.788 --> 36:31.189
COME ON.

36:31.189 --> 36:34.693
(exhales deeply) OH. OKAY.

36:34.693 --> 36:37.266
I... I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

36:37.266 --> 36:39.628
WE'RE GETTING RID
OF A DEAD BODYAGAIN.

36:39.628 --> 36:41.199
I KNOW. I'M SO SORRY.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.701
NO,
I JUST SPENT THE EVENING

36:42.701 --> 36:43.772
WITH MY HUSBAND'S
NEW GIRLFRIEND.

36:43.772 --> 36:45.404
THIS DOESN'T SOUND SO BAD.

36:45.404 --> 36:47.736
(door opens)

36:51.810 --> 36:53.982
HOW YOU FEELING?

36:53.982 --> 36:55.914
BETTER.

36:55.914 --> 36:58.347
THEY GAVE ME A SHOT
OF CORTISONE.

36:58.347 --> 37:00.449
THE DOCTOR SAID
IT WAS SOMETHING I ATE.

37:00.449 --> 37:03.352
MAYBE STRAWBERRIES OR NUTS.

37:03.352 --> 37:07.926
REALLY? UH, HE TOLDME
 IT WAS THE WOMAN LOVE FLUID.

37:07.926 --> 37:10.459
OKAY. GOOD-BYE.
NICE KNOWING YOU.

37:10.459 --> 37:11.700
I MEAN, YOU DO KNOW

37:11.700 --> 37:14.503
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO ROOFIE YOURSELF, RIGHT?

37:14.503 --> 37:15.804
GO AWAY.

37:17.766 --> 37:22.541
(sighs)
WELL, I DON'T GET IT.

37:22.541 --> 37:24.643
NOW WHY WOULD YOU TAKE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

37:26.244 --> 37:29.678
BECAUSE... I WANTED TONIGHT
TO BE SPECIAL, OKAY?

37:29.678 --> 37:32.751
AND...

37:32.751 --> 37:36.555
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T BEEN
WITH ANYONE SINCE MY DIVORCE.

37:36.555 --> 37:39.788
YOU...

37:39.788 --> 37:41.259
WHEN I MOVED HERE,
YOU OFFERED ME SEX

37:41.259 --> 37:42.861
BEFORE YOU EVEN KNEW
MY NAME.

37:42.861 --> 37:46.295
WELL, YEAH,
BUT THAT WAS BEFORE...

37:47.666 --> 37:49.398
CAN I PUT THE SHEET BACK ON?

37:49.398 --> 37:50.799
MM.

37:50.799 --> 37:54.573
THAT WASBEFOREI REALIZED
HOW MUCH I LIKE YOU.

37:57.446 --> 38:00.509
WELL, I LIKE YOU, TOO.

38:00.509 --> 38:04.613
UH, WOULD YOU LIKE SOME,
UH, COMPANY UNDER THERE?

38:16.795 --> 38:19.398
(sighs)

38:19.398 --> 38:22.030
(doorbell rings)

38:23.902 --> 38:25.834
♪ TRICK OR TREAT? ♪

38:35.714 --> 38:39.448
♪ TRICK OR TREAT? ♪

38:41.049 --> 38:44.523
UH, SO THIS IS THE PART
WHERE YOU GIVE ME CANDY.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.069
(latch clicks)

39:11.720 --> 39:14.723
(crickets chirping,
owl hooting)

39:21.860 --> 39:23.532
(engine turns off)

39:23.532 --> 39:26.064
(exhales deeply)

39:26.064 --> 39:28.066
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS.
WHAT EVER HAPPENED

39:28.066 --> 39:31.400
TO "NEVER RETURN TO THE SCENE
OF THE CRIME"?

39:31.400 --> 39:33.542
SHE'S GOT A POINT.

39:33.542 --> 39:34.843
WE JUST NEED TO DO THIS

39:34.843 --> 39:36.945
IN THE MOST EFFICIENT MANNER
POSSIBLE--

39:36.945 --> 39:38.807
FIND THE GRAVE,
DIG UP THE BODY...

39:38.807 --> 39:39.848
SOUNDS EASY SO FAR.

39:39.848 --> 39:42.481
WRAP IT IN A TARP, WEIGHT IT
DOWN WITH SOME BRICKS

39:42.481 --> 39:44.783
AND TOSS IT IN THE LAKE.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.455
I HAVE ALL THE SUPPLIES
IN MY TRUNK,

39:46.455 --> 39:47.956
ALONG WITH CLEAN TOWELS,
HAND SANITIZER,

39:47.956 --> 39:50.919
AND BREATHING MASKS IN CASE
THE STENCH IS OVERWHELMING.

39:59.468 --> 40:01.870
ANYONE WANNA GUESS
WHAT A CORPSE LOOKS LIKE

40:01.870 --> 40:04.433
AFTER TWO MONTHS
IN THE GROUND?
 OHH.

40:04.433 --> 40:05.904
OH, YEAH.
IS IT JUST BONES,

40:05.904 --> 40:08.707
OR IS THERE, LIKE,
OTHER STUFF, TOO?

40:08.707 --> 40:09.808
UGH.
 (man in distance) HEY!

40:09.808 --> 40:10.809
(gasps) SHH!

40:10.809 --> 40:12.140
(whispers)
DID YOU HEAR SOMETHING?

40:12.140 --> 40:14.412
YEAH. WHAT IS THAT?

40:14.412 --> 40:15.684
(man) HEY!

40:15.684 --> 40:16.915
(gasps)
 (man) WHO'S THERE?

40:16.915 --> 40:17.886
(whispers) WHO IS THAT?!

40:17.886 --> 40:19.548
I DON'T KNOW.
 (whispers) WHAT DO WE DO?

40:19.548 --> 40:21.019
RUN.
 OKAY!

40:21.019 --> 40:22.621
NO! SPLIT UP.

40:34.563 --> 40:37.065
(pating)

40:37.065 --> 40:39.968
(panting)

40:49.718 --> 40:50.979
(gasps) AAH!
 (thud)

40:50.979 --> 40:53.652
(panting)

41:10.138 --> 41:12.741
WHERE'D HE GO?
IS HE GONE?

41:12.741 --> 41:14.603
FOR NOW,
BUT WE GOTTA HURRY.

41:14.603 --> 41:17.475
I-I THINK WE'RE CLOSE.
I RECOGNIZE THIS AREA.

41:17.475 --> 41:18.707
OH, GOD,
THIS IS CREEPING ME OUT.

41:18.707 --> 41:20.078
WELL, IT DOESN'T HELP
THAT IT'S HALLOWEEN.

41:20.078 --> 41:21.780
LET'S JUST DIG HIM UP
AND GET THIS OVER WITH.

41:21.780 --> 41:22.881
OKAY.

41:22.881 --> 41:25.914
GABY?

41:25.914 --> 41:27.916
LYNETTE?

41:33.061 --> 41:34.893
OH, MY GOD.

41:40.529 --> 41:41.730
LADIES?

41:41.730 --> 41:44.603
LADIES!

41:44.603 --> 41:45.974
BREE?

41:48.907 --> 41:51.810
PARANOIA...

41:51.810 --> 41:53.712
IT'S THE IRRATIONAL FEELING

41:53.712 --> 41:57.045
THAT THE WHOLE WORLD
IS AGAINST YOU.

41:57.045 --> 41:58.516
NO.

41:58.516 --> 42:03.622
BUT IT'S NO LONGER PARANOIA
WHEN YOU DISCOVER...

42:04.923 --> 42:09.998
THAT SOMEONE REALLYIS
 OUT TO GET YOU.
