00:01.559 --> 00:03.459
Welcome to "Everlasting."

00:03.474 --> 00:05.204
Your suitor, Adam Cromwell!

00:05.239 --> 00:06.439
Let's go people,

00:06.450 --> 00:09.206
I want nudity, 911 calls, cat fights.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.177
Get me some good TV.

00:11.178 --> 00:13.179
Producers produce things.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.329
I create conditions for things to happen.

00:15.449 --> 00:17.983
Chet Wilton... creator of "Everlasting.

00:18.019 --> 00:19.667
You're very lucky that your little stunt

00:19.685 --> 00:21.639
got me boo-yah ratings last season.

00:21.683 --> 00:22.889
Are you taking your meds?

00:22.890 --> 00:24.770
- Don't do that, Mom.
- I'm sorry feel judged.

00:24.770 --> 00:25.924
Don't shrink me.

00:25.959 --> 00:28.670
Let's get out, have a
real life, real friends.

00:28.991 --> 00:31.038
"Everlasting" was my idea.

00:31.065 --> 00:33.329
I'm starting my own company,
and I want you to come with me.

00:33.534 --> 00:36.601
Jeremy and I have started
talking about getting out.

00:36.721 --> 00:38.037
Oh!

00:38.059 --> 00:40.693
Aren't you two so great at that together.

00:40.740 --> 00:42.873
You are gonna come and work
for me at my new company.

00:42.993 --> 00:44.981
I know, Rach... about Adam.

00:45.037 --> 00:47.228
I'm gonna make sure you never
hurt anyone like this again.

00:47.411 --> 00:49.013
- Come with me.
- No, Mary!

00:49.049 --> 00:50.449
She went off her meds.

00:50.483 --> 00:52.050
I swapped out a few of her pills.

00:52.085 --> 00:54.384
Going live. And action.

00:54.420 --> 00:56.754
- Camera "A," do you see her?
- Where is she?

00:56.963 --> 00:58.622
We have a runaway bride.

00:58.658 --> 00:59.912
This is live television.

00:59.923 --> 01:01.191
You've got to fix this.

01:01.226 --> 01:03.060
I want your full support moving forward.

01:03.095 --> 01:05.224
Anything. I'm about to lose my job.

01:05.573 --> 01:06.831
We won.

01:08.058 --> 01:11.167
We're gonna be kings
this year, Goldie. Kings!

01:11.178 --> 01:12.783
Right? Money, dick, power.

01:12.822 --> 01:14.880
- Love it.
- Yes. In that order.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.388
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:16.463 --> 01:18.241
- Yeah!
- Talk about it.

01:19.778 --> 01:21.249
- Gloomer.
- That's crazy.

01:21.255 --> 01:22.837
- Do me.
- It's a small, whole tattoo thing.

01:22.848 --> 01:24.862
- Okay, ready? What's up?
- What?

01:26.751 --> 01:28.651
Oh, look at this place.

01:28.687 --> 01:30.219
This does not look ready.

01:30.254 --> 01:31.821
This place doesn't look ready!

01:31.857 --> 01:34.550
Look at this. Nothing's ready.

01:34.832 --> 01:36.626
More pink, more pink...

01:36.661 --> 01:38.394
There's other colors in the rainbow.

01:38.429 --> 01:39.929
No, really, this is it, though.

01:39.965 --> 01:41.063
This is your year.

01:41.099 --> 01:42.398
Dare to dream, lady.

01:42.433 --> 01:44.449
Oh, come on, stop acting like you're not

01:44.469 --> 01:46.746
as happy as a pig in shit right now.

01:46.757 --> 01:48.404
Yes, no, I really am excited,

01:48.439 --> 01:49.584
and I think it is the right thing to do

01:49.606 --> 01:51.808
- for so many reasons.
- Can you stop? Stop selling me.

01:51.842 --> 01:54.038
Don't sell me. Okay,
save it for the network.

01:54.054 --> 01:55.511
That's why we go to Vegas.

01:55.546 --> 01:56.533
We sell the network,

01:56.577 --> 01:58.480
and as soon as they approve your idea,

01:58.600 --> 02:00.556
then I can start just kicking back

02:00.578 --> 02:02.459
and enjoying a seven-figure
production deal.

02:02.465 --> 02:03.610
Okay, how often are you gonna say

02:03.627 --> 02:04.960
"seven-figure production deal"?

02:04.989 --> 02:06.200
I just want to know
what we're talking about.

02:06.206 --> 02:07.390
Oh, I'm gonna say it a lot.

02:07.406 --> 02:09.083
I'm gonna go, "Seven-figure,
seven-figure, seven-figure."

02:09.116 --> 02:12.302
Seven figures. Seven is a lucky number.

02:12.374 --> 02:14.715
What's going on? You okay?

02:15.307 --> 02:16.529
Yeah.

02:16.649 --> 02:18.299
Great. All right, you ready?

02:18.334 --> 02:21.198
- Ohh! This bitch was born ready.
- Let's do this.

02:21.238 --> 02:22.637
We're talking Vegas.

02:22.672 --> 02:25.222
- Vegas! Here we go.
- Feeling it!

02:25.342 --> 02:28.058
Going to Vegas, baby!

02:52.915 --> 02:54.570
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

02:54.592 --> 02:56.412
Easy there, Amy Winehouse, all right?

02:56.418 --> 02:58.535
This is for the executives
we're buttering up.

03:01.525 --> 03:02.890
All right.

03:02.925 --> 03:04.154
I want to make a toast.

03:04.161 --> 03:05.626
We are thrilled

03:05.662 --> 03:07.995
that we have you under exclusive contract,

03:08.031 --> 03:10.810
and we cannot wait to
see what brilliant shows

03:10.837 --> 03:11.684
that you dream up.

03:11.700 --> 03:15.342
Thank you for 13 years of slave labor

03:15.391 --> 03:17.843
to get an overall deal.

03:17.963 --> 03:19.077
Cheers.

03:19.110 --> 03:21.655
- Yeah!
- To season 15.

03:21.655 --> 03:25.013
All right. We have a
surprise for you, Brad.

03:25.057 --> 03:29.950
May I introduce
"Everlasting's" next suitor...

03:29.999 --> 03:33.485
pro quarterback...

03:33.605 --> 03:37.707
Darius Beck!

03:42.731 --> 03:44.026
Are you serious?

03:44.507 --> 03:46.068
As a brain tumor.

03:46.188 --> 03:47.756
Nice to meet you.

03:48.359 --> 03:50.472
You just made my dick hard.

04:23.073 --> 04:24.664
You're a chieftain now, Chet.

04:24.736 --> 04:26.374
Go get your kingdom back.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.012
It was me.

04:28.305 --> 04:30.192
The first black suitor.

04:30.312 --> 04:31.575
It was me!

04:31.608 --> 04:33.467
We're gonna make history.

04:46.187 --> 04:48.809
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:52.682 --> 04:55.100
Everyone, shh. Network president.

04:55.271 --> 04:56.799
He's black.

04:56.816 --> 05:00.472
- Yeah, he's the first black...
- No, he's not that black.

05:00.638 --> 05:02.094
All right, Gary?

05:02.138 --> 05:05.043
- He's like, uh, football black.
- I know who he is.

05:05.054 --> 05:06.526
All right, I'm looking at him right now.

05:06.526 --> 05:07.847
He's black.

05:07.883 --> 05:10.100
Well, and how does it feel to
be finally beating the Eagles

05:10.122 --> 05:12.634
given your well-known beef
with Titus Washington?

05:12.668 --> 05:14.339
Really? That's your question?

05:14.389 --> 05:16.823
- Well, Titus said...
- Oh, who cares about what Titus said?

05:16.873 --> 05:18.161
Uh, what about this scandal?

05:18.173 --> 05:19.700
Uh, he called that reporter

05:19.711 --> 05:21.814
- a bitch on TV.
- Did you not see what I just did out there?

05:22.417 --> 05:24.563
- Bitch, please. I'm out of here, man.
- Hey, hey.

05:24.598 --> 05:25.632
Scaring the hell out of her.

05:25.638 --> 05:27.430
It looks like he's gonna
hit her right there on ESPN.

05:27.463 --> 05:28.742
- I'll break her!
- Chill.

05:28.758 --> 05:31.055
 Man, Titus ain't got shit on me!

05:31.077 --> 05:32.665
This is your idea of a love interest?

05:32.687 --> 05:34.596
Yeah, okay, first
of all, Gary, all right,

05:34.607 --> 05:36.961
he didn't call her a bitch.
He said, "Bitch, please,"

05:37.006 --> 05:38.688
which is a term of endearment.

05:38.975 --> 05:42.547
I mean, I say it to Rachel
all the time.

05:42.667 --> 05:46.199
And secondly, why would
he do our show, okay?

05:46.199 --> 05:49.120
These high-profile guys
wouldn't be caught dead with us

05:49.151 --> 05:52.372
unless they needed to rehab their image.

05:52.374 --> 05:54.051
And you know, hell yes,

05:54.064 --> 05:56.601
he's gonna be dating white chicks, okay?

05:56.888 --> 05:59.230
And hopefully, he's gonna
be making deep, dark,

05:59.350 --> 06:01.315
nasty love to them, too.

06:01.350 --> 06:03.709
I mean, the more white pussy the better.

06:03.895 --> 06:06.658
- Am I right, Gary?
- Uh, I'm sorry, what?

06:06.835 --> 06:10.824
I promise you 20 million viewers.

06:10.859 --> 06:13.913
The minute he lays black
hands on a white ass,

06:13.947 --> 06:15.476
Twitter will melt down.

06:15.498 --> 06:17.525
Oh, and the girls, Gary.

06:17.539 --> 06:20.867
We have a hot racist,

06:20.902 --> 06:23.195
an even hotter

06:23.567 --> 06:27.668
black activist power person.

06:28.459 --> 06:30.600
- Uh, a clergy.
- What?

06:30.833 --> 06:32.143
- And...
- You have that?

06:32.160 --> 06:33.527
... we have a terrorist.

06:33.549 --> 06:34.301
- A terrorist?
- No.

06:34.312 --> 06:37.870
They will be at each
other's throats from night 1.

06:37.909 --> 06:41.113
It will be a ratings bonanza.

06:41.129 --> 06:42.817
Or I can just get you

06:42.829 --> 06:45.805
another small-dicked
white boy from Missouri

06:45.811 --> 06:47.958
with a bunch of horny
kindergarten teachers

06:48.007 --> 06:49.606
because nobody's bored by that.

06:50.242 --> 06:51.615
Your call, Gary.

06:55.659 --> 06:58.537
This is on you, Quinn.
All right, it's your ass.

06:58.564 --> 07:01.021
You hear me? Your ass.

07:03.533 --> 07:04.828
Are you kidding?

07:04.948 --> 07:07.843
Football black? Nice, I'm gonna use that.

07:07.963 --> 07:09.276
Shut up, Brad.

07:09.746 --> 07:11.611
All right, did you get
all of that, though?

07:11.645 --> 07:12.818
- 'Cause I have to pee.
- What?

07:12.856 --> 07:14.577
The thing about all the Looney Tunes

07:14.577 --> 07:15.755
that we promised Gary.

07:15.794 --> 07:17.121
You have to go find them.

07:17.241 --> 07:19.893
What are you talking about?
Quinn, the show's cast.

07:19.895 --> 07:21.887
It's your new job, honey bear.

07:21.896 --> 07:23.259
I'm Chet, you're Quinn.

07:23.277 --> 07:26.015
I say crazy shit, and you make it happen.

07:31.375 --> 07:33.482
- That's your ab workout?
- It's like this.

07:33.499 --> 07:35.332
- You've never done it?
- No, I don't do that.

07:35.349 --> 07:36.676
Wow, so this is it.

07:36.796 --> 07:38.016
- Um...
- Oh.

07:38.056 --> 07:39.371
Yes, this is it.

07:39.547 --> 07:41.457
This is gonna be your house
for the next nine weeks.

07:41.466 --> 07:42.865
- Ooh.
- Cool.

07:42.900 --> 07:43.781
- Yeah.
- Cool.

07:43.821 --> 07:46.198
Okay, why does it seem like
you're not that excited?

07:46.437 --> 07:47.756
L... let me ask you this.

07:47.787 --> 07:49.655
I'm-a be on camera 24 hours a day?

07:49.775 --> 07:52.373
Um, you're the star of
a television program.

07:52.381 --> 07:54.626
Was there some sort of miscommunication?

07:54.857 --> 07:56.778
Because we talked it out,

07:56.800 --> 07:58.370
and I sort of had the impression

07:58.371 --> 08:00.298
that you two were gonna talk it out.

08:00.461 --> 08:02.219
My phone is ringing.

08:02.235 --> 08:03.732
I have to take it.

08:04.135 --> 08:06.640
I will be right back.

08:06.707 --> 08:08.225
I'm not dealing with this.

08:08.739 --> 08:10.102
What the hell did you get me into?

08:10.124 --> 08:11.027
You signed up for this.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.377
- Okay, no, what...
- You need this.

08:12.572 --> 08:13.873
You know what? You got a bad att...

08:13.904 --> 08:15.513
Oh, so, you gonna cancel me out?

08:15.548 --> 08:18.048
You gonna put your little
headphones on, cancel me out?

08:18.061 --> 08:20.048
Hey. Hey, yeah, no, I just...

08:20.168 --> 08:21.969
I just got to the
mansion. What's going on?

08:22.053 --> 08:25.179
I just landed, but did
you get Darius to move in?

08:25.241 --> 08:26.122
I'm working on it.

08:26.127 --> 08:27.880
He's having a little bit of
buyer's remorse right now.

08:27.906 --> 08:29.592
You know, I knew that guy
was gonna give us trouble.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.646
We should have never let
his manager move in with him.

08:31.686 --> 08:33.789
- I'll handle it.
- Yeah, you've been handling him

08:33.811 --> 08:35.006
since you met him, all right?

08:35.037 --> 08:35.967
- I got it.
- You know what?

08:35.985 --> 08:39.336
Gary is freaking out that
we can't top last season.

08:39.534 --> 08:40.664
And what does he want us to do?

08:40.690 --> 08:41.917
Kill someone every episode?

08:41.956 --> 08:43.374
Hm, when are you gonna be here?

08:43.409 --> 08:45.009
I'll be back in about an hour.

08:45.044 --> 08:47.786
Um, Romeo, your friends are here,

08:47.795 --> 08:49.857
the friends that I was hoping
were not gonna show up here,

08:49.866 --> 08:50.623
they've showed up here.

08:50.641 --> 08:51.867
Can you please take them to craft service

08:51.894 --> 08:53.744
and get them out of my way? Thank you.

08:57.113 --> 08:59.343
Why don't you just
tell me what's going on?

09:00.171 --> 09:02.610
It's just, I'm supposed
to be in Cabo right now

09:02.637 --> 09:04.528
enjoying my off-season.

09:04.563 --> 09:06.054
Okay, well, Cabo's great.

09:06.670 --> 09:09.684
But Cabo is not gonna get
you out of your P.R. problem.

09:09.719 --> 09:12.553
- Look, I didn't call that woman a bitch.
- I don't think you did.

09:12.571 --> 09:13.978
I think that she tried to bait you.

09:14.018 --> 09:15.430
I mean, what did... she
came over and talked to you.

09:15.440 --> 09:16.768
What was it? Like 19 minutes

09:16.790 --> 09:18.627
- after you got off the field?
- Exactly.

09:18.636 --> 09:20.388
Right, they want you to
be a monster on the field

09:20.406 --> 09:23.554
and then turn into some, like,
choir boy 19 minutes later?

09:23.558 --> 09:24.616
I mean, that's impossible.

09:24.634 --> 09:26.705
With all that adrenaline,
anybody would've snapped.

09:26.745 --> 09:28.715
I'm not anybody.

09:28.794 --> 09:30.074
I understand.

09:30.698 --> 09:32.826
You're the first black
quarterback on your team.

09:32.826 --> 09:34.902
You're also now the first black suitor.

09:35.022 --> 09:36.811
There's a lot of eyes on you. I get it.

09:42.379 --> 09:43.495
What'd your mom say?

09:45.889 --> 09:48.678
Whew, my mom was not happy.

09:49.329 --> 09:51.170
See, she raised me to always know

09:51.175 --> 09:53.408
that the rules were
gonna be different for me.

09:53.528 --> 09:55.437
Couldn't walk down the
street with my hoodie on.

09:55.446 --> 09:57.127
Didn't want people to get the wrong idea.

09:57.795 --> 10:00.819
Kept my nose pretty...
pretty clean, you know?

10:00.876 --> 10:02.514
Image... squeaky clean.

10:02.709 --> 10:05.435
No drugs, no drama, no baby mamas, and

10:05.834 --> 10:08.790
- then I go and do something stupid like this.
- Hey, listen.

10:09.383 --> 10:10.467
This is a one-time thing.

10:10.484 --> 10:12.392
This does not make you who you are.

10:14.401 --> 10:16.186
- If we're being honest...
- Mm-hmm.

10:16.226 --> 10:17.633
... mostly I feel like a...

10:17.841 --> 10:21.378
a caged lion and barely keeping
a lid on it half the time.

10:21.404 --> 10:22.525
Well, you're talking to somebody

10:22.538 --> 10:24.707
who literally went on
television and told the world

10:24.738 --> 10:27.198
that she thought her
job was Satan's asshole.

10:27.256 --> 10:29.013
No.

10:29.057 --> 10:31.068
- Are you serious?
- I'm, like, not kidding.

10:31.086 --> 10:32.697
Oh, yeah, that's beautiful.

10:32.711 --> 10:34.191
Okay, and you came back from that?

10:34.222 --> 10:35.475
Oh, yeah, I came back from that.

10:35.493 --> 10:36.909
I mean, I'm running the show.

10:37.667 --> 10:38.888
I can bring you back.

10:40.163 --> 10:41.226
Trust me.

10:42.731 --> 10:43.899
What's your plan?

10:44.152 --> 10:45.825
Uh, well,

10:46.095 --> 10:48.901
I have a house full of
lovely ladies for you.

10:49.317 --> 10:52.616
You have the opportunity to
fall in love with one of them.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.635
Let's not get crazy.

10:55.670 --> 10:56.998
Oh, okay, wait.

10:57.034 --> 10:58.964
Where do you stand? Do
you not believe in love?

10:58.973 --> 11:00.318
Like, where... what do we... where are we?

11:00.345 --> 11:01.495
Hey, when you're Darius Beck,

11:01.522 --> 11:02.987
things get a little complicated.

11:03.031 --> 11:04.993
Got it, okay. So, first of all,

11:05.024 --> 11:07.153
let's not refer to
ourself in third person.

11:07.179 --> 11:08.901
- That's not cute.
- Okay.

11:08.919 --> 11:09.924
Second of all,

11:09.933 --> 11:11.774
none of these women
know who the suitor is.

11:11.810 --> 11:14.213
I mean, none of them are here
to, like, bag some celebrity.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.315
When was the last time that
happened to you, honestly?

11:16.771 --> 11:17.860
Junior high.

11:17.869 --> 11:19.125
Thank you very much.

11:19.160 --> 11:21.685
Look, when they realize
who the new suitor is,

11:22.198 --> 11:23.420
that'll all change.

11:23.615 --> 11:24.956
All right, just, you never know.

11:24.969 --> 11:26.231
You could be surprised.

11:26.722 --> 11:27.935
Bitch, please.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.234
Oh, bitch, please, you.

11:30.371 --> 11:31.596
All right, let's go.

11:31.887 --> 11:33.555
- You like me. Come on, let's go.
- All right.

11:33.595 --> 11:35.795
Let's see what we got here.

11:36.817 --> 11:37.823
Rachel.

11:37.878 --> 11:39.226
- She wants to speak...
- I'm not kidding, Dan.

11:39.261 --> 11:41.133
- Doc, she wants to...
- Dan, go away.

11:41.164 --> 11:43.257
- Copy that.
- I need to talk about the "Healing Nook."

11:43.293 --> 11:46.333
- The what?
- My own set to film my on-air segments.

11:46.347 --> 11:49.400
Oh, yes, your on-air segments
that you got by blackmailing Quinn.

11:49.418 --> 11:51.255
I remember. Oh, I wouldn't be
throwing that particular stone

11:51.264 --> 11:52.357
if I were you.

11:52.822 --> 11:55.690
- I need my nook.
- Okay, put in a formal request.

11:56.127 --> 11:58.219
And not for nothing, your mother called.

11:58.339 --> 11:59.962
She's been talking to Jeremy again.

11:59.973 --> 12:02.386
She thinks you're having
hyper-sexual manic episode.

12:02.402 --> 12:04.555
I'm not manic. I'm changing the world.

12:04.675 --> 12:05.811
Jeremy.

12:06.439 --> 12:08.390
Jeremy.

12:08.408 --> 12:10.853
Hey. Did you raid Quinn's wardrobe?

12:10.875 --> 12:13.344
You're still talking
to my mommy. How is she?

12:13.379 --> 12:15.781
Hyper-sexual manic episode, seriously?

12:15.998 --> 12:17.985
Did you guys Google that or make it up?

12:18.277 --> 12:19.804
Looks like you haven't slept in weeks.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.163
And so, what? You're worried about me?

12:21.703 --> 12:23.177
I'm doing well, I get a promotion,

12:23.182 --> 12:24.804
yet somehow that...

12:24.864 --> 12:27.019
that triggers, like, alarm bells for you.

12:27.059 --> 12:29.467
No, I... I don't give
a rat's ass about you.

12:29.821 --> 12:31.556
But if anybody needs me to testify

12:31.583 --> 12:33.197
that you're a threat
to yourself and others,

12:33.381 --> 12:35.204
- yeah, I'm there.
- Oh, really? Is that right?

12:35.324 --> 12:36.957
Yeah, but it's mostly
for the others, though,

12:36.965 --> 12:39.914
because at this point, I'm actually
okay with you hurting yourself.

12:40.071 --> 12:42.273
In fact, I'm fairly certain that you will.

12:45.867 --> 12:48.379
- That's a really dark thing to say.
- Yeah.

12:49.375 --> 12:51.444
So, why'd you come back
if you think I'm so crazy?

12:51.483 --> 12:52.831
I came back 'cause this is my job.

12:53.069 --> 12:53.977
I'm sorry. Did...

12:54.357 --> 12:55.283
did you think that I...

12:55.305 --> 12:57.111
I really wouldn't come
back because of you?

12:57.739 --> 12:58.633
Yeah.

12:59.704 --> 13:01.860
Ah, I guess old Jeremy might not have.

13:02.307 --> 13:03.892
That guy was a pussy.

13:05.250 --> 13:06.629
That's why I killed him.

13:13.133 --> 13:15.412
- Hey, we got...
- Dan, stop.

13:15.532 --> 13:16.838
Okay.

13:25.469 --> 13:27.027
What the hell is going on?

13:27.089 --> 13:28.351
I need a walkie.

13:28.430 --> 13:30.507
Give me that. Just go do something.

13:30.627 --> 13:31.942
All right, I need somebody.

13:31.977 --> 13:33.558
Ricardo, where are you?!

13:33.612 --> 13:34.669
All right, where's Rachel?

13:34.691 --> 13:36.511
You guys, it's just rain, all right?

13:36.564 --> 13:37.747
You're not made of sugar.

13:37.783 --> 13:39.254
It's pronounced "Ya-el."

13:39.303 --> 13:40.675
A lot of people call me Yale,

13:40.737 --> 13:43.434
which, no thanks, I
went to Sarah Lawrence.

13:43.469 --> 13:44.991
J.D. Salinger taught there.

13:45.066 --> 13:47.103
Oh, for God's sake.

13:47.500 --> 13:50.209
Rachel!
Where the hell are you?

13:50.329 --> 13:52.232
Oh, I'm, uh, in here working on the intro.

13:52.267 --> 13:54.446
No, you're screwing up the intros.

13:54.450 --> 13:56.833
Madison's out there with
her thumb up her ass.

13:56.868 --> 13:59.173
Who decided to make her a producer anyway?

13:59.487 --> 14:00.349
Chet's penis,

14:00.371 --> 14:03.125
- after she blew him in your office.
- Oh, right.

14:03.165 --> 14:04.860
Did you get my Looney Tunes?

14:05.161 --> 14:07.260
Uh, Jay's on camera "B" with Tiffany,

14:07.278 --> 14:08.578
one of the wifeys.

14:08.613 --> 14:10.079
- Oh, she's pretty.
- Mm-hmm.

14:10.114 --> 14:11.492
But can she speak?

14:11.744 --> 14:13.085
Yeah, she can.

14:13.165 --> 14:14.422
And you're gonna say your name

14:14.440 --> 14:16.077
and tell us about your dad, okay?

14:16.126 --> 14:17.003
Ready?

14:18.573 --> 14:19.822
I already told you

14:19.844 --> 14:21.159
I don't want to talk about my father.

14:21.176 --> 14:23.048
Oh.

14:23.168 --> 14:24.964
- That could be juicy.
- Uh-huh.

14:24.969 --> 14:27.053
So, maybe her dad was a creep?

14:27.270 --> 14:29.072
Or a pedophile, hopefully.

14:29.103 --> 14:31.047
He's a rich white dude
who owns a football team.

14:31.065 --> 14:32.261
She's our football princess.

14:32.269 --> 14:33.611
What's going on with you shoes?

14:33.619 --> 14:35.293
All right, so, that's one wifey down.

14:35.324 --> 14:37.232
- Where's my villain?
- Okay.

14:37.245 --> 14:39.511
Um, she is getting ready,

14:39.529 --> 14:41.711
but I want you to, um, look at this.

14:41.747 --> 14:44.128
This is Beth Ann. She's from Mississippi.

14:44.164 --> 14:47.169
And this thing got
30,000 hits on Instagram,

14:47.183 --> 14:48.471
which is terrifying.

14:48.493 --> 14:51.365
Oh, Beth Ann. Aren't those even legal?

14:51.653 --> 14:54.423
Wait till she finds out
she's here to bag a black man.

14:54.485 --> 14:55.685
Uh-oh.

14:55.751 --> 14:59.398
Okay, um, I also want to
introduce you to London.

14:59.469 --> 15:02.404
She is our super-sexy Pakistani woman

15:02.435 --> 15:05.716
who might have distant
links to Osama bin Laden.

15:05.747 --> 15:06.801
No, now she does.

15:06.828 --> 15:08.470
Absolutely, that's what I was thinking.

15:08.514 --> 15:10.076
We have Ruby.

15:10.098 --> 15:12.541
She takes angry black woman

15:12.590 --> 15:14.223
to the level of blinding rage.

15:14.295 --> 15:15.999
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.044
Nicely done. So, her

15:18.066 --> 15:19.752
with the bikini girl...

15:19.770 --> 15:21.669
- genius.
- Oh, shit, no.

15:21.722 --> 15:23.656
Sorry, I should have pulled
her out of the sequence.

15:23.686 --> 15:25.028
She couldn't commit
to the full nine weeks.

15:25.028 --> 15:26.768
It's her last semester in college.

15:27.055 --> 15:28.403
- So?
- Seriously?

15:28.416 --> 15:30.754
- Mm.
- So, she would've had to drop out

15:30.758 --> 15:32.458
and miss graduating with her class.

15:32.714 --> 15:33.894
And?

15:33.929 --> 15:35.068
- Rachel.
- What?

15:35.077 --> 15:36.525
- Are you kidding me?
- Jay,

15:36.547 --> 15:40.151
then who's gonna fight
the racist, all right?

15:40.160 --> 15:42.160
It's not gonna be this pageant girl

15:42.169 --> 15:44.143
because you could snap her like a twig.

15:44.148 --> 15:45.489
Well, she's rooming with Beth Ann.

15:45.502 --> 15:46.954
So we'll see how she does.

15:47.942 --> 15:50.109
- What?
- All right, work this out

15:50.144 --> 15:52.512
or get a room or something, okay?

15:52.547 --> 15:53.633
I got to call Gary.

15:53.660 --> 15:57.073
I want the blacktavist
here by tomorrow night.

15:59.614 --> 16:00.959
Okay, what the hell are you doing?

16:01.021 --> 16:03.735
You and Quinn... you're
fine, everything's just fine.

16:03.740 --> 16:04.775
What do you mean "fine"?

16:04.789 --> 16:06.772
After she blew up your life last season,

16:06.821 --> 16:09.104
like atom bombed your little
happily ever after with Adam,

16:09.126 --> 16:11.393
- you're just twinsies, girl power.
- Can you stop? We worked it out.

16:11.433 --> 16:12.995
Right, you got paid.

16:13.044 --> 16:15.567
You're like one of those wives
whose husband beats them up

16:15.593 --> 16:17.129
- and then gives them a big diamond ring...
- Oh, my God.

16:17.151 --> 16:18.957
and promises to never do it again.

16:18.966 --> 16:21.369
Do you know something? That
I am the show runner, okay?

16:21.408 --> 16:23.499
And right now the show
runner is asking you

16:23.574 --> 16:26.021
why you weren't able to close Ruby.

16:27.902 --> 16:30.164
You know, even I didn't think I had line,

16:30.200 --> 16:31.683
but turns out,

16:31.750 --> 16:34.220
derailing a strong
black woman's education,

16:34.254 --> 16:35.999
- that's it.
- You know something?

16:36.017 --> 16:38.292
We're making a huge statement
just by having a black suitor.

16:38.314 --> 16:41.014
So if we have to sacrifice
a few people along the way

16:41.027 --> 16:44.136
- for the greater good, so be it.
- Yeah, you're right.

16:44.331 --> 16:46.548
We're like the Aztecs.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.381
- Or Hitler.
- Where is she?

17:00.728 --> 17:01.901
Oh.

17:03.197 --> 17:05.026
Ruby Carter, right? Ruby?

17:05.451 --> 17:06.446
Hi.

17:06.897 --> 17:08.415
Hi, I'm Rachel Goldberg.

17:08.487 --> 17:10.279
I am the show runner on "Everlasting."

17:10.398 --> 17:11.904
What? Look, I already told

17:11.916 --> 17:13.608
the little skinny brother no, okay?

17:13.638 --> 17:14.980
You need to leave.

17:18.726 --> 17:21.386
I'm sorry, but he just didn't
have all the information.

17:21.810 --> 17:24.409
What information is gonna
make me drop out of college

17:24.414 --> 17:26.156
to go be on a racist,

17:26.205 --> 17:28.472
misogynist reality
show I don't even watch?

17:28.512 --> 17:31.704
16 million viewers a week
for your political platform

17:31.708 --> 17:34.059
when your Twitter fame's
about to expire like bad milk.

17:34.777 --> 17:37.158
Black girls only last a
couple weeks on those shows,

17:37.220 --> 17:38.832
and they don't get any airtime.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.655
I thought you said you didn't watch.

17:42.709 --> 17:43.582
- Whatever.
- Okay.

17:43.599 --> 17:45.428
I'm sorry, does it not even matter to you

17:45.454 --> 17:47.455
that we're making history this season?

17:48.903 --> 17:50.192
The suitor's black.

17:51.448 --> 17:52.621
I'm sorry, what?

17:52.741 --> 17:54.281
It's a huge secret.

17:54.484 --> 17:56.649
The guy's also famous,
and he asked to meet you.

17:56.654 --> 17:58.163
Thinks you're an American hero.

17:58.220 --> 18:00.018
- And he's into you. He thinks...
- Wait.

18:00.138 --> 18:01.301
Let me get this straight.

18:01.368 --> 18:03.435
You think I got myself into Berkeley,

18:03.483 --> 18:05.829
worked this hard for what I believe in to,

18:05.909 --> 18:08.477
- what, get a man?
- I didn't go to Vassar to get a man.

18:08.512 --> 18:09.583
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- Did you hear me?

18:10.539 --> 18:11.287
I...

18:12.026 --> 18:14.059
You know what? You know,
you are... You're right.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.001
You should stay here.

18:15.037 --> 18:17.175
You should just let your
four underpaid professors

18:17.184 --> 18:18.772
read your senior thesis on... what is it?

18:18.803 --> 18:20.337
Post-colonial Africa?

18:20.406 --> 18:22.774
I get it. Why would you
want to use stupid old TV

18:22.792 --> 18:24.235
to spread your message. I mean,

18:24.261 --> 18:26.373
the teen birth rate, it went down 5.6%

18:26.421 --> 18:28.329
because of "Teen Mom" shows on MTV.

18:28.387 --> 18:30.513
And "The Real World"...
you remember that show?

18:30.839 --> 18:32.849
That show started the gay rights movement.

18:32.898 --> 18:36.346
But, yeah, TV's super useless
as a medium for change.

18:38.908 --> 18:41.041
I guarantee you will
make it to the final two.

18:41.077 --> 18:44.447
9 weeks, 16 million viewers each week.

18:52.675 --> 18:55.037
- Hey, Rach, what's up?
- She's in.

18:55.057 --> 18:56.876
Let's see how long she lasts.

19:06.876 --> 19:09.202
This place smells like ass.

19:10.470 --> 19:12.976
Madison, that better be
you with the air fresh...

19:14.623 --> 19:15.468
Chet?

19:15.747 --> 19:16.950
Hey, kiddo.

19:17.300 --> 19:18.999
Where did the rest of you go?

19:19.052 --> 19:20.477
Oh, well, this is what happens

19:20.517 --> 19:22.053
when you shed 50 pounds of weakness,

19:22.070 --> 19:23.668
sadness, and pussydom.

19:23.788 --> 19:26.483
Congratulations, I... I guess.

19:27.209 --> 19:29.533
But what the hell are you doing here?

19:29.653 --> 19:31.605
Brad suspended you from set duty.

19:31.636 --> 19:34.660
Oh, uh, Brad doesn't work
at the network anymore.

19:34.695 --> 19:35.912
Uh...

19:35.974 --> 19:37.174
I'm sorry, what?

19:37.209 --> 19:38.471
Gary's gonna hire somebody else.

19:38.493 --> 19:39.772
I threw out a couple names.

19:39.790 --> 19:41.715
So, you just disappear for six months

19:41.733 --> 19:43.061
and then get Brad fired?

19:43.105 --> 19:44.340
No, I didn't disappear.

19:44.362 --> 19:46.554
I went on a paleolithic lifestyle retreat

19:46.594 --> 19:47.612
with my grand leader.

19:47.643 --> 19:50.050
Oh, what is that? Like
CrossFit or some bullshit?

19:50.072 --> 19:52.334
CrossFit. That's amazing.

19:52.360 --> 19:55.329
No, I went hunting in
Patagonia with my tribe.

19:55.392 --> 19:56.680
That's how we evolved, Quinn.

19:56.703 --> 19:59.226
We've only been in
cities for like 400 years.

19:59.248 --> 20:01.268
We've been cavemen for like 20,000.

20:01.284 --> 20:03.037
Not even one part of that is accurate.

20:03.046 --> 20:05.108
A man isn't man unless he's

20:05.179 --> 20:06.958
got a purpose, Quinn.

20:06.993 --> 20:08.593
I... I got soft last year.

20:08.628 --> 20:12.174
I tried to fill the dark
hole of my manhood with,

20:12.356 --> 20:15.860
uh, processed flour and sugar, drugs.

20:15.873 --> 20:19.618
And I forced you
to play the male role.

20:19.658 --> 20:22.239
That wasn't fair, and it wasn't natural.

20:22.801 --> 20:25.829
Women are made to nurture, be adored.

20:25.949 --> 20:27.736
A guy's got to do things.

20:27.780 --> 20:31.371
Anyway, this show is my kingdom and, um,

20:32.008 --> 20:33.181
my purpose.

20:33.986 --> 20:35.186
I'm gonna take it back.

20:36.009 --> 20:38.129
Uh... no.

20:38.249 --> 20:39.904
It's mine. I earned it.

20:39.935 --> 20:41.475
Yeah, but see, I'm ready, I'm a chieftain.

20:41.515 --> 20:43.175
I got anointed, blooded.

20:43.210 --> 20:45.175
And I am the queen of
the frickin' fairies,

20:45.202 --> 20:48.756
and I need you to get the
hell out of my fairy fort now!

20:50.107 --> 20:51.107
Go!

20:51.227 --> 20:52.559
Hm, um...

20:52.594 --> 20:55.600
Get out and get off of my set

20:55.613 --> 20:57.747
because I can call Gary, too.

20:59.611 --> 21:01.801
We are the architects. We are the men.

21:02.071 --> 21:04.727
We are the architects. We are
the inheritors of the kingdom.

21:05.350 --> 21:06.649
Darius.

21:08.096 --> 21:08.972
Uh, Darius.

21:08.990 --> 21:10.074
Oh, man.

21:10.955 --> 21:12.248
Darius Beck.

21:12.368 --> 21:13.492
Chet Wilton.

21:13.717 --> 21:16.342
- I created the show.
- Pleasure. This is Romeo.

21:16.426 --> 21:17.893
Oh, Shakespeare.

21:19.242 --> 21:22.397
Uh, I'm sorry I wasn't around
earlier to introduce myself.

21:22.433 --> 21:23.730
I had my girls running things

21:23.739 --> 21:25.997
- while I was away at a conference.
- Mm-hmm.

21:26.355 --> 21:29.299
I got to say for two potent young studs

21:29.317 --> 21:31.301
about to meet a herd of willing female,

21:31.349 --> 21:33.120
you guys don't look as
happy as you should be.

21:34.577 --> 21:36.112
Why don't you tell me what you need?

21:38.549 --> 21:39.569
Romeo...

21:41.866 --> 21:44.172
Um, you guys, we're just
gonna start at the top...

21:44.194 --> 21:46.381
getting their panties
in a bunch, you know.

21:46.403 --> 21:48.528
Who's the suitor gonna be?
What's he gonna look like?

21:48.541 --> 21:49.426
- Do I have food in my teeth?
- Jay.

21:49.762 --> 21:50.595
Hey, what's up?

21:50.612 --> 21:52.272
Hey, man, my guys are getting on me.

21:52.299 --> 21:54.036
- You guys got the kill list yet?
- Oh, no, not yet.

21:54.075 --> 21:55.173
What's the kill list?

21:55.195 --> 21:56.842
Oh, she's so adorable.

21:56.846 --> 21:58.125
It's a list of all the girls getting cut

21:58.130 --> 22:00.002
so the camera guys know
who they can sleep with.

22:00.046 --> 22:01.224
Let me know when you get it

22:01.255 --> 22:03.548
'cause I call dibs on Hot Rachel.

22:03.610 --> 22:05.057
I don't want any pink on
... and excuse me, guys.

22:05.177 --> 22:07.890
- Dan, I just want to not...
- Sorry, we were just talking about the kill list, Hot Rachel.

22:09.168 --> 22:11.667
- Excuse me?
- Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.

22:11.787 --> 22:13.026
Uh, Ya... Yazmine.

22:13.066 --> 22:14.672
Who? Yael? It's a Hebrew name.

22:14.712 --> 22:16.274
- Yeah, what about her?
- Whatever.

22:16.358 --> 22:18.253
She's the one that kind of looks like you,

22:18.271 --> 22:20.493
except she's hot and not crazy and

22:20.670 --> 22:22.720
takes showers from time to time.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.463
All the guys are gunning for her, but

22:24.490 --> 22:25.725
you know the deal, Rach.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.213
Boss always dips first.

22:27.412 --> 22:28.575
Jeremy.

22:29.610 --> 22:30.738
Later.

22:34.096 --> 22:36.597
Okay, yeah, uh, it's time to hustle.

22:36.636 --> 22:38.745
Uh, let's make sure that we
have enough warm-up codes.

22:38.780 --> 22:39.804
- I won't.
- Hey, hey, hey.

22:39.830 --> 22:41.390
- He is so fired.
- Listen, Marie Antoinette.

22:41.393 --> 22:43.567
Look, I get the impulse.
He's a dick, all right?

22:43.629 --> 22:44.837
But you can't do that.

22:44.873 --> 22:47.599
He is a sexual harassment
lawsuit waiting to happen.

22:48.070 --> 22:49.702
Suck it up, Goldberg.

22:49.822 --> 22:52.032
If we fired everyone we had sex with,

22:52.043 --> 22:53.464
we wouldn't have a crew.

22:59.208 --> 23:01.498
Okay, um, camera.

23:01.532 --> 23:02.572
I just want to make sure

23:02.598 --> 23:05.196
that we're keeping that
camera moving at all times.

23:06.692 --> 23:08.649
Beth Ann and Chantal, you guys are good?

23:08.667 --> 23:10.022
Oh, Madison, hi.

23:10.035 --> 23:11.337
Uh, can I talk to you?

23:11.381 --> 23:12.736
Oh, yeah.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.665
About the room assignments for a jiff.

23:15.785 --> 23:17.564
Um, well, I c...

23:18.202 --> 23:20.078
Yes, you can. I am a producer.

23:20.131 --> 23:22.256
Right. Well, um,

23:22.376 --> 23:25.549
you know, Chantal, she seems real nice.

23:25.563 --> 23:27.299
But the thing is, I'm kind of wild,

23:27.312 --> 23:29.609
and I just don't think
that she's gonna feel

23:29.914 --> 23:32.097
at home with me.

23:32.159 --> 23:34.080
Well, it's... it's the first day.

23:34.102 --> 23:36.014
I just think that it's gonna be

23:36.961 --> 23:39.253
very uncomfortable for me.

23:41.348 --> 23:43.021
You know what? I'm gonna talk to my boss,

23:43.065 --> 23:46.235
and I'm going to see if I
can make some changes for you.

23:46.262 --> 23:49.117
Thank you. I had a feeling that
you would understand.

23:49.130 --> 23:50.958
Come here.

23:51.015 --> 23:52.459
We hug where I'm from.

23:52.852 --> 23:54.937
Okay.

23:54.977 --> 23:56.938
The contestants are
gonna be wearing jackets.

23:57.008 --> 23:58.912
It's freezing. They're not
gonna look good on camera.

23:58.943 --> 24:00.630
They'll be fine.
They're not gonna be fine.

24:00.648 --> 24:01.883
They're gonna look terrible.

24:02.065 --> 24:05.033
Hi, so, um... who was
asking for the kill list?

24:05.305 --> 24:06.460
That would be me.

24:06.832 --> 24:08.053
It was you.

24:08.359 --> 24:09.426
Awesome.

24:10.475 --> 24:11.830
- You're fired.
- Hey.

24:12.003 --> 24:14.021
That's my focus puller.
You can't fire him.

24:14.101 --> 24:15.509
And yet, I just did.

24:15.535 --> 24:17.259
Well, unless you want opening night

24:17.272 --> 24:18.698
of your show to be out of focus,

24:18.709 --> 24:20.343
you need to un-fire him.

24:20.624 --> 24:22.660
Yeah, so you know that's
not gonna happen because,

24:22.682 --> 24:25.064
um, the show being out of focus
is just gonna make you guys

24:25.082 --> 24:27.037
look like a bunch of incompetent assholes.

24:27.077 --> 24:28.582
And nobody's gonna blame me.

24:28.596 --> 24:29.990
So hire someone, promote someone.

24:30.017 --> 24:31.376
It's really not my problem.

24:31.496 --> 24:33.669
It turns out being a
sexist man-baby on my set

24:33.687 --> 24:35.081
has consequences.

24:35.360 --> 24:36.334
Handle it.

24:37.927 --> 24:39.543
That's my department manager.

24:40.211 --> 24:41.363
- I know.
- Bitch.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.979
Let me... let me talk
to her. I'll talk to her.

24:49.596 --> 24:52.522
Oh, um, did you get the car for Ruby?

24:52.960 --> 24:55.760
Yes, Rachel. She arrived
a few minutes ago.

24:55.769 --> 24:58.002
- Just getting settled in.
- Okay.

25:00.897 --> 25:03.482
Hey, so, uh, Beth Ann

25:03.553 --> 25:06.776
wants to switch rooms. And Tiffany
has an empty bed in her room,

25:06.798 --> 25:08.363
so I was just gonna put her in there.

25:08.381 --> 25:10.096
- Is that okay?
- Oh, wait, I'm sorry. Um,

25:10.132 --> 25:12.566
Beth Ann, our white supremacist, doesn't

25:12.758 --> 25:14.563
want to room with Chantal,

25:14.565 --> 25:15.751
our black debutante?

25:16.061 --> 25:18.164
Yeah, uh, I was just gonna move her.

25:18.177 --> 25:19.199
It would be super easy.

25:19.213 --> 25:22.028
Oh, okay, was it free lobotomy
week at Burke Williams?

25:22.112 --> 25:24.162
Madison, we aren't camp counselors.

25:24.166 --> 25:26.215
We don't solve problems, okay?

25:26.335 --> 25:27.712
We create them.

25:27.729 --> 25:29.655
And then we point cameras at them.

25:30.085 --> 25:31.830
We need you to go outside

25:31.950 --> 25:33.450
and create an on-camera fight

25:33.477 --> 25:36.304
between the racist and
the black debutante.

25:36.310 --> 25:37.847
Do you understand?

25:38.108 --> 25:39.374
Do you need some help?

25:39.400 --> 25:42.592
Wagerstein, what is the
shrink dirt on these ladies?

25:42.614 --> 25:46.363
Oh, well, Chantal is
a type-A control freak.

25:46.420 --> 25:48.784
- Okay.
- Kind of a time bomb waiting to go off.

25:48.837 --> 25:50.953
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, and her fiancé died

25:50.975 --> 25:52.636
in a car accident a year and a half ago.

25:52.667 --> 25:53.933
Oh, perfect. Great.

25:53.946 --> 25:56.305
Okay, so you're gonna use
that little bit of information,

25:56.327 --> 25:57.836
and you're gonna interview her.

25:57.841 --> 26:00.594
Okay, you're gonna get her
to cry and show you tears.

26:00.616 --> 26:02.644
She's gonna ask you,
"Will I ever love again?"

26:02.657 --> 26:04.711
It's gonna build all
this sympathy for Chantal.

26:04.733 --> 26:06.585
And Beth Ann's gonna
look like a total dick

26:06.620 --> 26:07.935
for not wanting to room with her.

26:07.968 --> 26:09.265
Does that make sense?

26:09.327 --> 26:10.682
Well, I just really don't think

26:10.708 --> 26:12.196
she's gonna want to talk about that.

26:12.240 --> 26:14.617
I mean, how am I supposed to force her?

26:14.737 --> 26:16.919
I don't know. Tell her your
mother died or something.

26:16.950 --> 26:18.463
Act like you get it.

26:19.570 --> 26:20.942
My mom did die.

26:22.026 --> 26:23.292
There you go.

26:23.536 --> 26:25.709
Right there, you see that? You use that.

26:29.232 --> 26:31.016
Oh, my God.

26:37.603 --> 26:40.051
Nice, Rachel. That was really nice.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.362
So, that's it? That's your plan?

26:42.384 --> 26:44.247
You're just gonna make
Quinn look like the good cop?

26:44.327 --> 26:47.509
No, my plan is to make a
top-rated television program

26:47.527 --> 26:49.386
with a black romantic lead.

26:49.913 --> 26:51.662
Do you have a problem with that?

26:52.832 --> 26:54.729
- I do not.
- Okay, great.

26:54.764 --> 26:56.269
Well, then can you go
get Beth Ann's interview

26:56.278 --> 26:58.124
talking trash about her black roommates?

26:58.141 --> 26:59.349
'Cause I don't have
anything for the promo.

26:59.380 --> 27:01.576
Thanks, bye.

27:03.745 --> 27:05.130
Ooh.

27:06.440 --> 27:07.967
Oh.

27:08.792 --> 27:09.647
Hm.

27:09.804 --> 27:11.749
Did I forget to tell you that

27:12.422 --> 27:14.117
being the boss sucks?

27:17.655 --> 27:19.523
Nice jacket, by the way.

27:20.245 --> 27:21.666
Helmut Lang.

27:24.193 --> 27:27.265
Well, here's to booze and fancy clothes.

27:33.251 --> 27:35.351
This so exciting.

27:35.386 --> 27:36.619
Yeah.

27:37.066 --> 27:39.545
So, Chantal, I'm really curious.

27:39.554 --> 27:41.190
What's your story?

27:41.226 --> 27:43.886
Ugh. My God, she's never
gonna get this done.

27:43.908 --> 27:45.803
Well, I was born in Atlanta.

27:46.064 --> 27:47.368
Me and my mom and...

27:47.430 --> 27:50.099
What is this? That's some
general crap nobody cares about.

27:50.139 --> 27:52.134
A... are you excited to be here?

27:52.202 --> 27:54.151
I'm very excited to be here.

27:54.171 --> 27:55.588
She's wasting my time. You know what?

27:55.619 --> 27:56.393
I'm just gonna go out there

27:56.424 --> 27:57.921
- and do this myself.
- No, stop.

27:57.939 --> 28:00.927
- No, don't stop. This is ridiculous.
- Rachel, Rachel, stop. All right?

28:01.011 --> 28:02.653
How is she gonna ever learn anything

28:02.698 --> 28:04.557
if you don't delegate and teach her?

28:04.765 --> 28:06.727
Like what I'm doing with you right now?

28:06.847 --> 28:09.094
You're screwing up,
and I'm not taking over.

28:09.413 --> 28:10.385
Yet.

28:10.905 --> 28:13.871
You are in charge of
everything on these monitors,

28:13.915 --> 28:16.044
not just getting one girl to cry.

28:16.164 --> 28:19.124
So get in the idiot's ear
and tell her what to do.

28:19.143 --> 28:20.333
Understood.

28:24.419 --> 28:25.437
He's really nice.

28:25.450 --> 28:27.681
- I think...
- Okay, Madison, hi.

28:27.699 --> 28:30.488
I need you to listen to everything
I say and just repeat after me.

28:30.515 --> 28:32.689
- Do you understand?
- Okay. Yeah, uh, copy.

28:32.991 --> 28:34.108
Copy?

28:34.908 --> 28:37.891
Sorry, I just do that sometimes.

28:37.931 --> 28:39.976
I... I talk, it's stupid. Um,

28:40.020 --> 28:41.105
- okay, okay.
- How's she doing?

28:41.225 --> 28:42.959
Madison, just listen to me.

28:42.981 --> 28:45.434
Just say what I say.
Don't say anything else.

28:45.895 --> 28:47.749
"So, Atlanta, what was
it like dating there?

28:47.785 --> 28:50.047
- I hear it's... "
- So, Atlanta,

28:50.051 --> 28:51.334
what was the dating there like?

28:51.343 --> 28:53.906
- I heard that it's really hard.
- No, don't fill in the blank.

28:53.913 --> 28:54.890
We want her to do that, okay?

28:54.897 --> 28:56.756
Do you get it? It's like
a couplet. I say something.

28:56.770 --> 28:58.347
and then she'll say the
rest of the sentence.

28:58.467 --> 28:59.514
I'm sorry.

28:59.873 --> 29:01.941
What was it you wanted
to talk about exactly?

29:01.985 --> 29:03.211
Okay, listen, Madison.

29:03.238 --> 29:05.203
We need something for the promo, okay?

29:05.323 --> 29:06.706
Just ask her,

29:06.889 --> 29:08.575
"So, why are you still single?"

29:09.248 --> 29:11.306
Why are you still single?

29:14.232 --> 29:15.325
Um...

29:15.799 --> 29:18.376
Don't say anything, Madison.
Keep your mouth shut.

29:18.411 --> 29:20.310
Silence is your friend.

29:22.869 --> 29:24.453
I had a fiancé.

29:25.095 --> 29:26.069
He died.

29:26.383 --> 29:28.180
She's got a dead fiancé.

29:28.206 --> 29:30.105
- Holla!
- Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

29:30.145 --> 29:32.564
That's good, Madison.
Just keep looking at her.

29:32.599 --> 29:34.166
I want you to ask her,

29:34.202 --> 29:36.217
"Oh, my God, what happened?"

29:36.476 --> 29:37.817
Oh, my God.

29:38.632 --> 29:39.924
What happened?

29:41.495 --> 29:42.620
Car accident.

29:44.621 --> 29:46.918
Did a drunk driver hit him or something?

29:46.940 --> 29:48.698
No, Madison, don't say "drunk driver."

29:48.716 --> 29:49.690
Did I say "drunk driver"?

29:49.716 --> 29:51.925
Shut your mouth and
just do as you're told.

29:52.333 --> 29:53.485
Bad weather.

29:53.709 --> 29:54.917
Ice storm.

29:55.687 --> 29:57.202
We were driving back from the mountains.

29:57.322 --> 29:58.906
"Were you in the car?"

29:59.498 --> 30:00.925
Say it, Madison.

30:00.961 --> 30:02.522
You were in the car?

30:04.725 --> 30:06.046
I was driving.

30:06.166 --> 30:09.228
- Holy crap.
- Oh, my God, that's great, Madison.

30:09.241 --> 30:10.868
Just keep looking at her, okay,

30:10.877 --> 30:13.104
keep looking really
shocked, okay, Madison?

30:13.139 --> 30:16.082
Build sympathy for her, and
then you're gonna ask her,

30:16.498 --> 30:18.105
"Did you kill him?"

30:18.729 --> 30:20.844
- So...
- Madison, just keep looking at her, okay?

30:20.858 --> 30:22.244
It's time to gut this bitch.

30:22.248 --> 30:24.895
Say the words, "Did you kill him?"

30:26.042 --> 30:27.888
"Did you kill him?"

30:28.959 --> 30:30.663
Did you kill him?

30:32.571 --> 30:34.912
- What?!
- Stay strong, Madison.

30:35.032 --> 30:36.434
Don't speak.

30:36.489 --> 30:39.645
I loved him. I... I saw him die.

30:39.765 --> 30:41.978
"So, you didn't kill him?"

30:43.106 --> 30:46.888
- So, you didn't kill him?
- How can you ask me that?

30:46.950 --> 30:48.857
I did not kill him!

30:48.888 --> 30:50.278
I'm so sorry.

30:50.742 --> 30:52.469
How do you like puppeteering?

30:52.527 --> 30:54.544
Are you kidding me? I feel like God.

30:54.579 --> 30:56.444
If I had been in that position,

30:56.480 --> 30:57.923
I would have blamed myself.

30:57.998 --> 31:01.132
My mother just died a little while ago,

31:02.115 --> 31:04.999
and she was really worried
about me moving to California.

31:05.008 --> 31:07.738
She wanted me to go home, and I didn't.

31:09.643 --> 31:11.591
She just had a heart attack.

31:13.109 --> 31:15.707
I thought... I'm so sorry.

31:15.764 --> 31:18.769
You must miss him so much.

31:19.075 --> 31:20.717
Madison, stop crying.

31:20.738 --> 31:22.355
She's about to give you the goods.

31:22.377 --> 31:24.339
Just look at her and ask her,

31:24.374 --> 31:26.304
"Will you ever love again?"

31:28.593 --> 31:30.748
Will you ever love again?

31:34.187 --> 31:37.512
I will love again or die trying.

31:37.530 --> 31:39.217
There's our damn promo line.

31:39.261 --> 31:40.359
I'm sorry.

31:40.416 --> 31:41.642
Just...

31:56.066 --> 31:58.238
What the hell is
he doing with the camera?

32:06.214 --> 32:07.882
I'm sorry Rachel made you do that.

32:08.764 --> 32:09.543
You okay?

32:10.526 --> 32:13.395
That was amazing.

32:24.767 --> 32:26.214
Places, places.

32:26.223 --> 32:28.596
Okay, we are
T-minus 10 minutes, people.

32:28.627 --> 32:30.774
If this place isn't as
tight as a unicorn's butthole

32:30.796 --> 32:33.041
in five minutes, everyone is fired.

32:33.076 --> 32:35.016
Yeah, we got a problem.
She won't put it on.

32:35.379 --> 32:36.724
She says she never wears one.

32:36.768 --> 32:39.283
I don't care that she has
never worn a head scarf.

32:39.305 --> 32:40.779
Quinn promised the network a terrorist.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.231
Our audience will not understand

32:42.231 --> 32:44.338
unless she is actually
dressed like a terrorist.

32:44.352 --> 32:45.693
 Put a head scarf on her, please.

32:45.733 --> 32:48.110
Muslim women are fighting and dying for
the right not to cover up.

32:48.154 --> 32:49.598
- What's wrong with you?
- You know, wearing a head scarf

32:49.620 --> 32:51.424
doesn't actually make you a terrorist.

32:51.459 --> 32:53.263
But wearing pigtails at your age

32:53.276 --> 32:55.988
- does make you retarded.
- That's true.

32:55.997 --> 32:57.625
Can we not use that word this season.

32:57.665 --> 33:00.319
- It's a micro-aggression.
- Shut up, Wagerstein.

33:00.390 --> 33:02.041
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- My God.

33:02.045 --> 33:03.970
Okay, here we go.

33:04.005 --> 33:06.505
Wifeys, bitches, and sluts, oh, my.

33:06.578 --> 33:08.774
- Seconds away.
- Good job, Goldberg.

33:08.809 --> 33:11.526
That actually looks like
a TV show... a real TV show,

33:11.553 --> 33:13.540
- your TV show.
- Oh, thank you.

33:13.548 --> 33:16.218
- I have training wheels on at best.
- Oh, but I just let go.

33:16.250 --> 33:17.957
Look, network, no hands.

33:18.010 --> 33:20.684
- Aaah!
- Does anybody see Graham?

33:20.724 --> 33:21.950
Can I please get a 20

33:21.968 --> 33:23.637
on the host of our television program?

33:23.657 --> 33:24.983
Okay, he's still getting makeup done.

33:25.036 --> 33:27.290
What is he getting? A
chimpanzee face transplant?

33:27.321 --> 33:29.375
If he isn't on his mark in 15 seconds,

33:29.388 --> 33:30.344
I am gonna come in there,

33:30.357 --> 33:32.225
and I'm gonna grab him by the balls,

33:32.231 --> 33:34.372
- and I'm gonna put him on his mark.
- Oh, God.

33:34.386 --> 33:36.422
I literally just thought
about touching Graham's balls.

33:36.436 --> 33:38.303
That's so disgusting. I
bet they're fake tanned.

33:38.307 --> 33:40.046
- Like without question, he tans his balls.
- Oh, my God.

33:40.073 --> 33:41.490
- He does.
- Ew! Ew!

33:41.499 --> 33:45.280
- Madison, you're such a little slut, seriously.
- You are a slut, you have issues.

33:45.302 --> 33:46.099
Control yourself.

33:46.112 --> 33:47.462
- Wag?
- Can we not talk about balls?

33:47.480 --> 33:49.131
You see "hairy balls" yet?

33:49.157 --> 33:49.839
- Demanding, man.
- Here, sir.

33:49.852 --> 33:50.861
Right in the middle, okay.

33:50.883 --> 33:53.783
Okay and, um, we are rolling

33:53.805 --> 33:56.293
in three, two,

33:56.598 --> 33:58.634
one... action.

33:58.696 --> 34:02.109
Ladies, beautiful, wonderful ladies.

34:02.131 --> 34:05.765
Welcome to season 14 of "Everlasting."

34:05.792 --> 34:07.783
Now, usually our suitor waits for you.

34:07.788 --> 34:09.474
But see, this season, our suitor

34:09.492 --> 34:10.784
is more well-known,

34:10.842 --> 34:12.882
more prominent than ever.

34:12.954 --> 34:15.654
And in order to get our
ladies to be surprised,

34:15.774 --> 34:17.005
we had to make them wait...

34:17.042 --> 34:18.306
... until now.

34:20.005 --> 34:21.277
Ladies, are you ready?

34:25.004 --> 34:27.252
Ugh, it looks like "My
Little Pony" threw up.

34:27.277 --> 34:28.975
Too much pink.

34:29.279 --> 34:31.554
All right, well, then, prepare yourselves

34:31.802 --> 34:33.583
because this season,

34:33.650 --> 34:37.583
this man is not only
handsome, wealthy, and smart,

34:37.938 --> 34:40.096
But he is also a national hero.

34:40.322 --> 34:44.373
So I urge you, ladies, open
your hearts to your suitor.

34:44.438 --> 34:47.880
All right, let's get ready
to see some panties drop.

34:55.112 --> 34:56.253
What?

34:56.429 --> 34:57.345
What the... ?

34:58.764 --> 35:00.280
Why isn't someone yelling "cut"?

35:00.400 --> 35:01.730
Rach, it's you.

35:02.190 --> 35:04.126
Cut! Cut! Cut!

35:05.249 --> 35:07.081
Weren't you supposed to be watching him?

35:08.291 --> 35:10.388
Oh, my God.

35:12.278 --> 35:14.948
Hello, this is the host of "Everlasting."

35:14.959 --> 35:16.475
Give me the phone.

35:16.536 --> 35:18.516
- Is that... is this part of it?
- Probably.

35:18.534 --> 35:19.399
Quinn?

35:20.331 --> 35:21.310
Hello?

35:21.371 --> 35:23.076
Big dog's back, kiddo.

35:23.196 --> 35:26.000
Don't "kiddo" me, Chet.
Where the hell is my suitor?

35:26.045 --> 35:27.987
Oh, no. No, no, no. He's my suitor now.

35:28.025 --> 35:29.979
You want to talk to him,
you got to deal with me.

35:32.148 --> 35:33.548
- What the hell, Rachel?
- What?

35:33.575 --> 35:34.698
Chet has the suitor?

35:34.770 --> 35:36.640
How did you let Darius out of your sight?

35:36.651 --> 35:39.195
You should've had a P.A.
superglued to his ass.

35:39.206 --> 35:41.393
- I did... I had Madison on it.
- Really?

35:41.442 --> 35:42.859
Transpo! Now!

35:42.892 --> 35:45.022
You know what? This is gonna be
fine. Let's just push one day.

35:45.050 --> 35:46.411
- We'll send the crew home right now...
- No, we are not pushing dick.

35:46.439 --> 35:48.328
We are going and getting our suitor.

35:48.363 --> 35:49.598
Get in the car.

35:51.299 --> 35:53.659
Get back to work. Stop standing around.

35:53.687 --> 35:55.170
Oh, my God.

36:03.724 --> 36:05.141
Unbelievable.

36:05.433 --> 36:08.711
We missed an hour of our
night for shrimp buffet.

36:09.013 --> 36:10.624
Way to manage, Goldie.

36:13.064 --> 36:15.349
Excuse me, thank you very much. Gary.

36:15.897 --> 36:17.146
Hi.

36:17.422 --> 36:19.613
- Wow, you look great.
- Oh, you too.

36:19.615 --> 36:21.190
What a surprise to see you here.

36:21.217 --> 36:23.926
Well, I'm here to see
our man, Darius, right?

36:23.939 --> 36:24.893
Yes, of course.

36:24.929 --> 36:27.135
Uh, do you mind if I
borrow Chet for a minute.

36:27.153 --> 36:28.131
Apparently not.

36:28.800 --> 36:30.166
- Gents.
- Good luck.

36:33.094 --> 36:35.230
What the hell are you doing, Chet?

36:35.280 --> 36:36.939
- Huh?
- What are you doing?

36:36.974 --> 36:38.855
You wanted to fight like a
man. That's what I'm doing.

36:38.871 --> 36:40.061
I'm fighting like a man.

36:40.443 --> 36:41.577
I see.

36:41.612 --> 36:44.808
So, you have Darius,
but what about the girls?

36:44.928 --> 36:45.848
I got girls.

36:45.875 --> 36:48.383
Oh, you loaded up a minivan
with strippers, Chet.

36:48.949 --> 36:50.450
Every girl I have back at the house,

36:50.459 --> 36:52.897
I handpicked based on a story.

36:52.898 --> 36:54.886
And then I weave that
into television drama

36:54.904 --> 36:56.608
that I turn into massive ratings,

36:56.639 --> 36:59.142
which you have never, ever done.

36:59.671 --> 37:01.610
So, Romeo, what is going on?

37:01.627 --> 37:03.212
Come on, I thought we
had each other's backs.

37:03.257 --> 37:05.412
- What's happening here?
- Oh, why?

37:05.448 --> 37:07.103
Because you treat me like a walking dildo?

37:07.223 --> 37:08.343
Please, you love it.

37:08.374 --> 37:10.746
Look, it takes a player to know a player.

37:10.812 --> 37:12.422
This show needs a major revamp.

37:12.424 --> 37:14.030
Now, when I was away all those months,

37:14.039 --> 37:15.372
I wasn't just working on myself.

37:15.394 --> 37:17.453
I was thinking about the
show's cultural legacy.

37:17.484 --> 37:19.533
- Oh, God.
- We're telling men that it's okay

37:19.547 --> 37:22.610
to swoop out of the sky in
diamond-studded helicopters.

37:22.614 --> 37:24.933
Women don't respect that.
You know what they respect?

37:25.145 --> 37:27.898
A man who can kill with his bare hands.

37:27.923 --> 37:30.660
- Chet just offered us better stuff.
- What stuff did he offer you?

37:30.740 --> 37:33.604
Uh, private accommodations,
our cellphones.

37:33.639 --> 37:35.202
- Mm.
- Oh, yeah.

37:35.272 --> 37:37.730
And a three-year pay-or-play
sportscasting deal if...

37:37.766 --> 37:39.288
He doesn't even have the authority

37:39.300 --> 37:41.714
- to offer you something like that.
- Oh, he didn't?

37:41.732 --> 37:43.564
The network president, Gary?

37:43.648 --> 37:44.609
Yeah, he did.

37:44.631 --> 37:46.357
Now, if you'll excuse me.

37:48.420 --> 37:51.717
We have created a generation
of wimps and bitches.

37:51.775 --> 37:53.744
We've got a whole audience
who's waiting for us

37:53.766 --> 37:56.329
to show them the natural order of things.

37:56.386 --> 37:58.099
Man, the audience is gonna eat that up.

37:58.135 --> 37:59.822
Are you sure you're not still on drugs?

37:59.854 --> 38:01.512
- No.
- I've never been this clean.

38:01.579 --> 38:02.421
It's like us.

38:02.424 --> 38:05.240
I tried as a hard as I could to
be everything you wanted me to be.

38:05.261 --> 38:07.819
And I ended up a castrated, obese mess.

38:07.824 --> 38:10.674
You ended up a dried-up old spinster.

38:13.149 --> 38:14.466
What do you want, Chet?

38:15.535 --> 38:17.947
I want the girls to
come to Darius... here...

38:18.120 --> 38:20.417
in bikinis, pool-side cocktails.

38:20.434 --> 38:22.643
We would lose three
more hours of hard night

38:22.661 --> 38:23.732
on a company move,

38:23.763 --> 38:26.291
and that would leave
us two hours to shoot.

38:27.162 --> 38:28.193
Hmm.

38:32.695 --> 38:34.257
Bring Darius to the mansion right now,

38:34.257 --> 38:35.811
and I will ditch the evening gowns.

38:35.822 --> 38:37.689
I will give you a pool and the bikinis.

38:38.998 --> 38:41.318
Or I could just go and tell Gary

38:41.340 --> 38:42.709
that we're gonna push a few days.

38:42.757 --> 38:44.584
All right, we'll do it
my way at the mansion.

38:45.386 --> 38:46.868
But this is far from over.

38:47.466 --> 38:49.330
I'm taking my kingdom back.

38:49.732 --> 38:51.330
May the best man win.

38:52.592 --> 38:54.093
She usually does.

39:00.972 --> 39:02.663
Chet just declared war.

39:07.604 --> 39:08.945
Any issues, guys?

39:09.003 --> 39:10.048
Okay, people,

39:10.061 --> 39:12.920
we've got five hours of
hard night to get this.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.599
Okay? Thank you. I
need lights in the pool.

39:15.639 --> 39:18.354
I need all the girls out of
their gowns and into bikinis.

39:18.409 --> 39:21.153
Oiled up, spray-tanned, and pube-less now.

39:21.273 --> 39:22.503
And what the hell is that?

39:22.536 --> 39:23.898
No, you got to cover that up.

39:23.926 --> 39:25.541
Wifeys have no tattoos.

39:25.586 --> 39:27.705
And what are you... what is this?

39:27.760 --> 39:29.321
No, unless you have a great story

39:29.326 --> 39:31.130
about being a burn victim under there,

39:31.139 --> 39:33.607
- you're got to change.
- This is all I have.

39:33.809 --> 39:35.543
- Seriously?
- I will fix it.

39:35.615 --> 39:37.850
Okay, get her P.A. over here right now.

39:37.894 --> 39:39.798
Put her in someone else's
underwear if you have to

39:39.809 --> 39:41.475
because I'm an underwear psychic,

39:41.497 --> 39:43.732
and I bet this bitch
packed granny panties, okay?

39:43.749 --> 39:45.608
Get me our coats now.

39:45.652 --> 39:47.312
- Go. Move it! All right?
- Coats.

39:47.355 --> 39:47.938
- Get them.
- Excuse me.

39:47.982 --> 39:49.127
- Wagerstein.
- Yeah?

39:49.160 --> 39:51.048
- You want to get in a bikini, too?
- No.

39:51.070 --> 39:52.813
- Out. Now.
- Got it.

39:52.857 --> 39:54.296
Thank you. Buh-bye.

39:54.335 --> 39:56.222
I've got something that
would look banging on her

39:56.250 --> 39:58.352
- back in our room.
- Who are you?

39:58.363 --> 39:59.647
Oh, I'm...

39:59.708 --> 40:01.694
Oh! Wait.

40:01.814 --> 40:04.079
- Oh, my God.
- Don't do it.

40:04.129 --> 40:06.253
That's, uh... that's Hot Rachel.

40:08.041 --> 40:09.844
That is amazing.

40:09.878 --> 40:12.290
- Can you not?
- Yes, please go.

40:12.323 --> 40:14.508
Run, Hot Rachel, run.

40:14.536 --> 40:16.393
- Coats, I got coats.
- Thank you.

40:16.863 --> 40:19.747
She really looks like you.
That's kind of amazing.

40:19.786 --> 40:20.682
All right, listen.

40:20.699 --> 40:25.236
I don't want to see any
razor burn, people, okay?

40:25.258 --> 40:28.888
Use duct tape if you have to,
but I want those pubes out.

40:28.926 --> 40:30.758
Quinn, if I keep following
you around like this,

40:30.763 --> 40:31.981
the crew's gonna have a really hard time

40:31.987 --> 40:33.276
believing I'm the show runner.

40:33.396 --> 40:35.572
Oh, okay. So, were you show-running

40:35.584 --> 40:37.371
when you let Chet steal our suitor?

40:37.753 --> 40:39.157
No, I was recruiting Ruby,

40:39.163 --> 40:41.825
and you didn't even warn
me that Chet was back.

40:41.863 --> 40:43.960
No one warns you about anything

40:43.971 --> 40:45.731
- when you're the boss.
- That's not our deal!

40:47.280 --> 40:50.186
Okay, listen to me, okay?

40:50.202 --> 40:50.878
- Mm.
- Look at me.

40:50.917 --> 40:51.747
Mm-hmm?

40:51.808 --> 40:53.047
You're my girl.

40:53.167 --> 40:56.107
But I need Chet dead forever.

40:56.362 --> 40:57.495
You'll get another shot.

40:57.506 --> 40:59.310
I just got to steer us
past this train wreck,

40:59.343 --> 41:02.115
and then I will hand the show back to you.

41:02.846 --> 41:04.589
Money, dick, power, right?

41:07.007 --> 41:09.558
Yeah. Yeah, money, dick, power.

41:10.316 --> 41:11.456
Right.

41:11.655 --> 41:13.083
All right, let's do this.

41:13.154 --> 41:15.661
Even I can't stop the sun from rising.

41:15.689 --> 41:17.753
Lord knows I've tried.
