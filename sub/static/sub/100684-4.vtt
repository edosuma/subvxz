37:38.081 --> 37:41.302
It's guarded. I need backup.

37:41.346 --> 37:43.348
How many?

37:43.391 --> 37:45.393
Three.

37:49.179 --> 37:52.052
You, you and you, Trey.

37:52.095 --> 37:53.358
Done. You three.

37:53.401 --> 37:56.926
Uh, thing is, uh...

37:56.970 --> 38:00.278
she expects me
to send you a message.

38:01.322 --> 38:03.324
One of my guys?

38:03.368 --> 38:04.804
Yeah, but...

38:07.546 --> 38:09.461
[exhales]

38:12.725 --> 38:14.379
Now go get it.

38:23.562 --> 38:26.652
My guess is she's got guys inthe living room and in the back.

38:26.695 --> 38:29.437
Look, whatever
we have to do, we do it.

38:29.481 --> 38:31.744
We get this house,
we get Nia Bailey.

38:31.787 --> 38:33.267
Let's go.

38:34.355 --> 38:36.531
I can't go in with y'all.She got cameras.

38:36.575 --> 38:39.491
But she keeps her stuffin the cabinets above the sink.

38:39.534 --> 38:40.970
All right?

38:41.014 --> 38:43.103
All right, we're gonna roll up
on the house discreetly.

38:43.146 --> 38:46.454
Sirens off. Ram the front door,clear that front room,

38:46.498 --> 38:48.761
give me the okay sign,
we'll be right behind you.

38:48.804 --> 38:50.371
Once you take out the guards,get the product

38:50.415 --> 38:51.677
and get out of there.

38:51.720 --> 38:53.113
There'll be guys
bagging in the basement.

38:53.156 --> 38:54.810
They will hear the shots.

39:01.077 --> 39:02.514
Oh, my God.

39:02.557 --> 39:03.906
Cops got to it.

39:07.170 --> 39:09.347
Drive. Drive.

39:16.179 --> 39:18.704
At least Nia will no longer
be a problem for Josiah.

39:18.747 --> 39:20.749
You know what I'm saying?
We good now. We home, baby.

39:20.793 --> 39:23.448
[whooping]Let's go! Yo!

39:23.491 --> 39:25.493
Let's go![excited chatter, laughter]

39:27.495 --> 39:28.844
Clear.

39:33.240 --> 39:35.155
Search it.

39:43.642 --> 39:45.165
Where the hell is it, man?

39:48.821 --> 39:50.823
Where are we going?

39:53.042 --> 39:55.044
Miss?

39:57.482 --> 39:59.440
Sunrise Cleaners.

40:02.574 --> 40:04.880
[sighs]

40:04.924 --> 40:06.926
I have something to tell you.

40:09.450 --> 40:11.887
Okay.

40:12.932 --> 40:15.717
Dean got something out of Max.

40:15.761 --> 40:18.241
Something that could
take you down.

40:19.242 --> 40:21.070
He never told Sarah,

40:21.114 --> 40:24.987
but, um... he told Dean.

40:25.031 --> 40:26.815
And I'll tell you what it is,

40:26.859 --> 40:29.209
but you have to do
something for me.

40:30.253 --> 40:32.255
What's your price?

40:35.258 --> 40:36.912
Max.

40:37.957 --> 40:39.959
Call off the hit on him.

40:41.874 --> 40:44.659
That's quite a price.

40:44.703 --> 40:47.575
I know how much
your organization is worth.

40:55.888 --> 40:58.281
So, what's your information?

40:58.325 --> 41:01.284
He knows where your drugs are.

41:05.593 --> 41:07.552
Max was lying.

41:07.595 --> 41:09.945
No, he wasn't.

41:09.989 --> 41:11.120
[sighs]

41:11.164 --> 41:13.166
She moved it.

41:14.646 --> 41:17.779
That presents a problem for me.

41:17.823 --> 41:19.999
I got nowhere to put them.

41:24.351 --> 41:26.005
Yes, you do.

41:30.923 --> 41:32.664
[door opens]

41:32.707 --> 41:34.709
[footsteps echoing]
