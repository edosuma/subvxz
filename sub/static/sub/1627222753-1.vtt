01:12.746 --> 01:17.384
<i>Good evening.</i>

01:19.485 --> 01:25.859
I'm Mister Pat.

01:25.892 --> 01:30.397
and I'm... and I am...

01:31.964 --> 01:35.068
back.

02:34.628 --> 02:36.029
<i>Good afternoon, residents.</i>

02:36.330 --> 02:38.866
<i>Lunch will be served
in five minutes.</i>

02:39.266 --> 02:43.471
<i>Our special item of the day,
fruit cocktail.</i>

03:24.978 --> 03:27.981
Good, Pat.
Keep those legs moving.

03:44.698 --> 03:45.732
A word?

03:45.998 --> 03:47.033
What's it, Doc?
What's it say?

03:47.067 --> 03:48.836
I wouldn't suggest a...

03:49.169 --> 03:51.639
No, I don't think so,
the words are too small.

03:54.006 --> 03:55.676
You guys gonna go outside?

03:56.543 --> 03:59.747
- I wouldn't. I'm not going...
- You're going outside?

03:59.779 --> 04:02.650
- ...or I think I will.
- No, no.

04:02.682 --> 04:04.050
I'll help you get out there.

04:04.083 --> 04:05.785
We'll have
a little picnic outside.

04:05.819 --> 04:09.624
It won't hurt my hair
or anything if it's windy.

04:09.956 --> 04:11.758
You're not getting hurt
by any of that.

04:11.791 --> 04:13.760
You're not gonna
let me go outside with you?

04:13.794 --> 04:15.195
Sure, it'll be fine.

04:15.228 --> 04:16.829
I don't know. I don't know.

04:16.863 --> 04:19.166
I think my daughter
is coming today.

04:24.104 --> 04:26.272
How is
your book coming along?

04:26.306 --> 04:29.043
It's not very interesting.

04:29.075 --> 04:30.743
Why do you keep reading it?

04:32.145 --> 04:34.047
I haven't
got anything else to do.

04:34.847 --> 04:35.782
That's too bad.

05:43.150 --> 05:44.952
<i>Eunice!</i>

05:47.287 --> 05:48.289
<i>Eunice!</i>

05:49.722 --> 05:53.093
Pat! You're still alive?

05:57.464 --> 05:58.932
What did I tell you about

05:58.964 --> 06:00.301
keeping your head elevated?

06:03.936 --> 06:06.706
What am I gonna do with you?

06:12.912 --> 06:13.948
There you go.

06:18.085 --> 06:19.854
I saw that, bitch.

06:20.520 --> 06:23.089
Girl, you are too much.

06:29.729 --> 06:31.265
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

06:31.530 --> 06:33.266
<i>Good morning, miss.</i>

08:11.431 --> 08:17.171
A Mr. Shanrock here to see you.
Says he's an attorney.

08:19.905 --> 08:22.175
Should I tell him you dead?

08:24.044 --> 08:28.248
Patrick Pitsenbarger!
It's been years.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.354
Have you seen
<i>The Register</i> today?

08:34.419 --> 08:37.090
I'm sorry to let you know that,

08:37.624 --> 08:40.027
a former client has passed away.

08:41.428 --> 08:42.563
We've lost...

08:44.496 --> 08:46.199
Rita Parker Sloan.

08:48.068 --> 08:51.005
Rita specified in her will
that you

08:51.204 --> 08:53.573
were to do her hair
and make-up for the funeral.

08:54.607 --> 08:58.279
Uh, first showing is day
after tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.

08:59.279 --> 09:03.284
Ransom Funeral Home will require
your services tomorrow night.

09:09.088 --> 09:10.991
That photo is from a year ago.

09:11.591 --> 09:14.528
Perhaps you could recreate
the same hairstyle?

09:16.096 --> 09:19.332
- Split ends and all?
- He speaks!

09:19.966 --> 09:23.270
Oh, I'll... I'll never forget...

09:24.069 --> 09:27.607
how you used to make up Rita
for her Christmas parties

09:27.640 --> 09:28.875
at the mansion.

09:29.643 --> 09:31.312
Boy oh boy, Patrick...

09:32.544 --> 09:34.414
you made Rita Parker Sloan

09:34.447 --> 09:36.283
the most glamorous woman
in town.

09:36.316 --> 09:37.952
She should
have updated her will.

09:38.785 --> 09:41.921
I entered
her final revisions personally

09:41.954 --> 09:43.122
a week before she died.

09:43.689 --> 09:47.560
Rita left me as a client.
You remember?

09:47.794 --> 09:51.231
I also remember
you were close friends,

09:51.264 --> 09:53.634
dear friends.

09:55.635 --> 09:57.637
I haven't pulled hair in years.

09:58.005 --> 10:01.408
Naturally,
the will makes a provision

10:01.674 --> 10:03.177
for services rendered.

10:12.452 --> 10:14.554
Rita wants to make things right.

10:19.558 --> 10:21.028
I'm retired.

10:23.228 --> 10:25.465
Let bygones be bygones,
Patrick.

10:26.066 --> 10:28.202
It's not healthy
to hold a grudge.

10:31.203 --> 10:35.342
You would deny
a great woman her dying wish?

10:38.611 --> 10:40.213
Show the gentleman the door.

10:44.650 --> 10:46.185
Mr. Shanrock?

10:48.053 --> 10:51.357
Bury her with bad hair.

10:54.059 --> 10:55.294
<i>The medication window</i>

10:55.327 --> 10:57.130
<i>is now open. The medication...</i>

14:47.327 --> 14:49.630
You smoking in here, Pat?

14:51.698 --> 14:56.436
Uh-uh.
Well, let's elevate your head.

15:07.880 --> 15:09.982
Okay, stay calm, stay calm.

15:10.015 --> 15:13.252
Breathe.

15:13.285 --> 15:15.654
How many times
have you promised?

15:17.723 --> 15:19.193
Where they at, Pat?

15:21.260 --> 15:22.762
I know they are around here
somewhere.

15:24.329 --> 15:27.633
Sometimes I think you want
to have another stroke.

15:32.771 --> 15:36.576
Shaundell, that's all I have.

17:08.367 --> 17:10.470
Miss Gertie
always had beautiful hair.

17:18.578 --> 17:19.980
Remember this one?

17:44.570 --> 17:45.739
Beautiful.

18:03.656 --> 18:04.825
Don't worry.

18:07.059 --> 18:08.528
We will clean it up.

20:10.181 --> 20:13.152
Here, it's open.

21:39.271 --> 21:41.140
- Morning.
- Hello.

21:43.376 --> 21:47.013
Is the Ransom Funeral Home
still downtown?

21:47.246 --> 21:48.582
Yes, sir.

21:49.082 --> 21:51.650
Water Street, just down past
the Parker Sloan Mansion.

21:52.717 --> 21:53.786
Have a nice day.

21:54.553 --> 21:56.055
It's some hike
from here though.

22:01.660 --> 22:05.798
Sir, are you all right?

22:07.166 --> 22:08.168
Lemme give you a hand.

22:16.141 --> 22:17.243
I'm fine.

22:17.642 --> 22:18.877
Can I give you a ride to Ransom?

22:18.910 --> 22:19.912
No, no, no.

22:22.047 --> 22:23.182
I'm going shopping.

22:43.101 --> 22:47.107
- Pack of Mores.
- Mores? For real?

22:52.378 --> 22:54.214
Folks don't ask
for these nowadays.

22:56.248 --> 22:58.250
Your wife still smokes Mores?

23:13.466 --> 23:14.967
She adores them.

23:18.938 --> 23:22.708
Knapp Beauty Supply,
still on Tiffin Avenue?

23:23.208 --> 23:24.910
No clue, dude.

23:24.944 --> 23:27.847
Uh, there's a fabulous salon
down by the waterfront,

23:27.880 --> 23:29.348
Dee Dee Dale's place.

23:29.380 --> 23:31.316
She's still alive?

23:31.617 --> 23:34.986
- Dee Dee has everything.
- Thank you, miss,

23:35.019 --> 23:39.725
but my client demands
high quality beauty products.

23:40.159 --> 23:42.261
Like Vivanté.

23:42.294 --> 23:45.098
They still make Vivanté?

23:45.331 --> 23:47.766
5.23.

23:47.800 --> 23:49.069
For one pack?

23:53.773 --> 23:55.074
You can charge it instead?

23:55.374 --> 23:57.943
- You cash checks?
- Personal?

24:00.813 --> 24:01.948
Government.

24:04.449 --> 24:06.218
I know what you're thinking.

24:06.851 --> 24:09.788
"How could someone so flawless,

24:10.523 --> 24:14.127
possibly be on Social Security?"

24:14.694 --> 24:17.363
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

24:19.364 --> 24:21.800
Two more packs of Mores
for the road.

24:33.344 --> 24:35.481
21.92 is your change.

24:37.149 --> 24:38.450
And some tickets.

24:41.019 --> 24:45.090
Two, "Some Like it Hot",
eight, "Casino Royale"

24:45.123 --> 24:47.493
and one,
"Fastest Road To One Million."

24:49.527 --> 24:50.462
Hit me.

25:22.328 --> 25:25.865
Hm.

25:55.694 --> 25:58.464
That rock sure is different.

25:58.930 --> 26:02.067
There are plenty more
where this came from.

26:06.237 --> 26:12.544
David gave them all to me
and each one has a story.

26:14.045 --> 26:15.047
I'll bet.

26:18.984 --> 26:22.188
- I have a job to do.
- What's that?

26:22.921 --> 26:26.258
I have to make a lady beautiful.
Her hair.

26:27.059 --> 26:28.160
Is that what you do?

26:28.192 --> 26:29.427
- You are a beautician?
- Yeah.

26:29.460 --> 26:31.096
I was. Yeah, yeah.

26:31.831 --> 26:35.967
I'm a hairdresser,
I was very successful...

26:36.001 --> 26:39.572
- Oh!
- ...when I was young in this beautiful town.

26:40.005 --> 26:43.443
I had the best clients,
the richest woman.

26:45.377 --> 26:46.445
- Who was that?
- And then...

26:46.477 --> 26:48.081
- What?
- Who was that?

26:48.380 --> 26:49.448
Rita.

26:51.350 --> 26:54.553
And then, my assistant opened
her own store

26:54.585 --> 26:56.955
right across from me.

26:57.255 --> 27:01.060
And took one of my most
important clients with her.

27:01.259 --> 27:05.230
- That took some nerve.
- Yeah, and then my friend died.

27:07.265 --> 27:08.601
Your friend, David?

27:08.801 --> 27:14.640
Yeah, David died.
And I took a second mortgage.

27:15.408 --> 27:21.080
But, the nephew took everything.
He got everything. I lost it.

27:22.581 --> 27:25.618
- What did David die of?
- AIDS.

31:32.863 --> 31:33.832
Hello.

31:36.301 --> 31:37.736
Sandusky.

31:51.416 --> 31:53.319
Now, you know, there's a lot
of things that I am not,

31:53.351 --> 31:55.286
- and the one is one of them.
- I know that.

31:55.320 --> 31:57.590
I know that, girl. I know it.

31:57.622 --> 31:59.391
Honey, you are
a fiery one yourself too.

32:05.496 --> 32:07.600
- This used to be...
- White?

32:09.034 --> 32:10.703
My beauty supply store.

32:12.303 --> 32:14.640
- I had an account.
- Oh.

32:15.140 --> 32:19.245
You goin' way back in the day.

32:19.644 --> 32:21.246
Whatchu looking for?

32:21.280 --> 32:23.916
Perfect Powder Bleach
and Vivanté.

32:28.053 --> 32:29.388
You won't get that here.

32:30.788 --> 32:33.592
And baby, that smack
don't stick to nappy heads.

32:34.060 --> 32:36.595
Now, if you want some
Kizzy's Daughter Pomade,

32:36.628 --> 32:38.264
or Miss Zora's Buttercream.

32:38.296 --> 32:41.499
Hell, even some juicy ass
Jerri Curl, I got you.

32:41.733 --> 32:45.904
- Try Dee Dee Dale's downtown.
- I'd rather swallow mucus.

32:45.937 --> 32:48.541
Oh!

32:48.806 --> 32:51.476
Why don't you tell us,
how you really feel?

32:51.677 --> 32:56.548
He right though, I graduated with
Dee Dee and she nasty.

32:56.581 --> 33:00.419
Well, Dee Dee's the only game
in town these days, for real.

33:03.255 --> 33:06.458
Aw, baby. You look
like your poodle just died.

33:07.226 --> 33:08.927
I mean, we lost
our Sally Beauty.

33:08.959 --> 33:10.962
Unless you finna drive
all the way out to Lorain.

33:13.497 --> 33:16.869
Whoa, hold up, baby.
Slow your roll.

33:18.704 --> 33:21.407
Now, your poor, white head
turned to a hot damn crisp.

33:21.439 --> 33:22.475
Yes, it is.

33:22.707 --> 33:24.575
I don't suppose
you sell sunscreen?

33:26.711 --> 33:30.448
Sunscreen! You...

33:30.748 --> 33:32.951
Oh, bless his heart.
Help him out.

33:35.954 --> 33:37.023
Hmm.

33:44.763 --> 33:49.068
Here, take Erma's hat.

33:49.435 --> 33:53.339
I don't wanna hear nothing
about no skin cancer.

33:54.739 --> 33:56.409
And Erma won't miss it?

33:59.444 --> 34:02.882
No, baby. Erma's dead.

34:04.582 --> 34:06.718
Erma don't miss shit.

34:10.922 --> 34:12.425
Come on, sashay.

34:13.391 --> 34:14.726
"Hattitude."

34:15.092 --> 34:19.630
- "Hattitude"
- Ro Ro: Yes. That girl!

34:20.998 --> 34:23.502
- My goodness.
- A mess.

34:23.702 --> 34:27.806
Oh, child.

34:28.039 --> 34:29.806
<i>102.7.</i>

34:29.840 --> 34:31.842
<i>It's gonna be another
scorcher out there, Sandusky.</i>

34:31.876 --> 34:34.380
<i>Checking the weather,
it is hot!</i>

34:48.059 --> 34:49.628
Let's go.

35:13.651 --> 35:15.887
What?
Oh!

35:29.066 --> 35:31.503
- Bye.
- Bye.

36:49.780 --> 36:53.785
<i>Hey, mister.</i>

36:54.985 --> 36:56.955
<i>Everyone's here.</i>

37:03.028 --> 37:04.697
<i>Come out to the garden.</i>

37:05.197 --> 37:06.499
Can you hear me?

37:15.907 --> 37:17.709
You tore my house down?

37:21.880 --> 37:23.948
- She was just too far gone.
- We feel sick.

37:27.184 --> 37:29.220
Did you find
anything down there?

37:29.553 --> 37:34.193
- Like what?
- There was a box of Vivanté.

37:38.262 --> 37:40.164
Ooh! Don't go anywhere.

37:42.934 --> 37:45.104
Please, let's step outside.

37:51.075 --> 37:55.981
Here, David and I
planted the calla lilies.

37:58.782 --> 38:02.853
And there, was the fountain.

38:02.887 --> 38:04.289
Oh, is that what that was?

38:08.059 --> 38:09.327
My client,

38:09.827 --> 38:13.097
Rita, donated the tiles
she brought back from Italy,

38:13.564 --> 38:15.133
to do her master bath.

38:15.434 --> 38:18.035
But then she changed her
mind about the color.

38:23.941 --> 38:27.579
David built it.
Everything from scratch.

38:28.380 --> 38:32.651
- Sounds like quite a guy.
- But he didn't have a will.

38:34.686 --> 38:35.287
Oh.

38:36.720 --> 38:40.159
His nephew inherited everything.

38:47.331 --> 38:50.034
Well, at least something like
that can never happen today.

38:50.568 --> 38:54.640
- Yeah. Great.
- Surprise! Remember this?

38:56.206 --> 38:57.308
Where's my shampoo?

38:57.742 --> 38:59.745
This was all that was
left in your old house.

39:06.684 --> 39:07.952
I think I should go.

39:08.552 --> 39:10.355
Will you come back
and visit sometime?

39:12.256 --> 39:13.325
Yeah.

39:22.300 --> 39:24.336
- Bye, Pat.
- Bye.

39:24.568 --> 39:27.105
Thanks for the lunch!

39:45.490 --> 39:49.328
Sandusky, here I come.

39:57.334 --> 39:59.237
- Hello.
- Hi.

40:16.488 --> 40:17.723
Eunice?

40:19.289 --> 40:20.159
Eunice?

40:23.193 --> 40:24.063
Eunice.

40:35.307 --> 40:36.842
<i>Shanrock and Shanrock.</i>

40:37.342 --> 40:39.443
<i>Uh, Walter Shanrock,
please.</i>

40:39.477 --> 40:41.480
<i>He's at the
courthouse until 4:00.</i>

40:41.512 --> 40:45.784
- <i>What's this in reference to?</i>
- <i>Rita Parker Sloan.</i>

40:51.389 --> 40:53.124
Uh, cream and sugar.

41:17.849 --> 41:19.284
<i>Try Dee Dee Dale's downtown.</i>

41:19.316 --> 41:21.152
<i>Dee Dee has everything.</i>

41:21.186 --> 41:23.488
<i>I graduated
with Dee Dee. She nasty.</i>

41:30.994 --> 41:32.764
That'll be 83 cents.

41:36.901 --> 41:37.903
Thank you.

42:13.604 --> 42:15.106
<i>Hey, mister.</i>

42:17.275 --> 42:18.376
<i>Come to the garden.</i>

43:21.673 --> 43:23.408
So sorry
to hear about Rita.

43:23.441 --> 43:24.877
Yes, great woman.

43:26.144 --> 43:27.312
Mr. Shanrock.

43:30.581 --> 43:33.117
- Mr. Shanrock?
- Pat?

43:35.385 --> 43:38.456
I'll do Rita. One condition.

43:39.189 --> 43:41.927
I need cash now.

43:42.394 --> 43:44.930
Oh, I'm sure,
Rita would be tickled pink.

43:45.396 --> 43:47.131
But there's a protocol, Pat.

43:47.465 --> 43:50.434
I can't just make a withdrawal
from First Sandusky.

43:50.468 --> 43:53.572
Oh no?
Your brother owns the bank!

43:54.472 --> 43:58.109
We will be delighted to
prepare a certified check

43:58.142 --> 44:02.581
for 25,000 dollars after
the estate clears probate.

44:02.914 --> 44:06.584
- And how long will that take?
- No more than six months.

44:07.151 --> 44:11.188
Six months?
I'll be dead by then!

44:11.222 --> 44:14.124
Listen, buster. I know
we've had our ups and downs.

44:14.157 --> 44:15.393
But like I told you,

44:15.660 --> 44:17.662
when your partner's next
of kin retained the firm,

44:17.695 --> 44:20.432
to settle his estate,
I don't make the rules.

44:20.764 --> 44:22.700
And I most certainly
don't walk around town

44:22.733 --> 44:24.436
with my client's money.

44:24.468 --> 44:30.976
I have expenses. I have
to purchase beauty products.

44:34.644 --> 44:40.017
Give me a loan. Some
kind of advance, please.

44:42.019 --> 44:46.557
Would two tens help?

44:54.698 --> 44:58.202
The Ransoms will have
Rita ready by 7:00 p.m. tonight.

44:58.235 --> 45:01.238
Please be prompt. You know
Sherman doesn't like to wait.

45:19.590 --> 45:22.293
<i>Please stop!
Please stop! Please stop!</i>

45:29.034 --> 45:33.604
- Jeffrey, keep the change.
- Why, thank you.

46:35.532 --> 46:37.334
<i>I don't have
a two, I don't have three,</i>

46:37.367 --> 46:39.804
I don't have four,
but I have five.

46:40.405 --> 46:43.207
Linda,
I'm gonna take you at five.

46:43.240 --> 46:44.742
We're gonna do the straightener.

46:45.477 --> 46:48.680
- Do you have an appointment?
- No.

46:49.546 --> 46:53.617
Okay. I'm just gonna
put this in for you.

46:53.651 --> 46:56.521
And, here's five percent off
of your next

46:56.553 --> 46:59.624
and you'll have Caroline.
She's so good. Okay, darling?

46:59.657 --> 47:01.292
- Thank you very much.
- Of course.

47:01.325 --> 47:03.294
- Have a wonderful day.
- You too.

47:13.436 --> 47:14.805
Oh my God.

47:18.342 --> 47:19.244
Pat?

47:21.479 --> 47:22.481
Is it you?

47:23.947 --> 47:24.815
No.

47:25.749 --> 47:27.351
You look so...

47:29.787 --> 47:30.856
athletic.

47:36.293 --> 47:38.729
Wow. Come on in.

47:41.298 --> 47:43.767
Now, Tristan, check this out.

47:45.336 --> 47:47.671
This man gave me
my first job in the business.

47:48.972 --> 47:51.909
And now he is,
mopping your Vivanté.

47:52.510 --> 47:53.445
Well...

47:54.345 --> 47:57.849
he shouldn't have done that,
but after all,

47:58.416 --> 48:03.220
you gotta catch this guy a break
'cause, he really is a legend.

48:04.889 --> 48:06.724
This is Patrick Pitsenbarger.

48:07.224 --> 48:10.794
He did all the socialites
of Sandusky back in the day.

48:12.697 --> 48:14.900
That's right. Once upon a time.

48:16.767 --> 48:20.772
Well, I can dust that off
for you if you want.

48:24.008 --> 48:26.945
Yeah, you know,
I started off sweeping hair,

48:27.211 --> 48:30.715
and then, I worked my way all
the way up to second chair.

48:32.249 --> 48:35.719
I was so proud when Dee Dee
opened up her own shop.

48:36.253 --> 48:39.191
Right across the street
from mine.

48:40.691 --> 48:46.198
You know, Patrick
was always so particular.

48:47.131 --> 48:50.401
And Dee Dee was very nice
to my clients.

48:51.001 --> 48:56.273
In fact, she took my best
one with her when she quit.

48:59.677 --> 49:01.479
Well, Sandusky is...

49:02.780 --> 49:04.849
having a real comeback
right now, huh?

49:06.784 --> 49:07.818
Maybe...

49:08.452 --> 49:12.591
My business is doing great.
I know that.

49:13.090 --> 49:16.493
I mean, I've had to expand
this place and make it

49:16.526 --> 49:20.231
a multi-service salon
with all the amenities.

49:21.099 --> 49:26.671
Clients want craft, Dee Dee,
not bells and whistles.

49:27.738 --> 49:28.873
No...

49:29.572 --> 49:34.011
God forbid, you ever listened
to anybody about anything.

49:41.385 --> 49:42.754
You know what, they, uh...

49:43.988 --> 49:46.658
they've discontinued the Vivanté

49:46.691 --> 49:50.562
because it's...
It's got too high VOCs.

49:50.861 --> 49:52.896
But you know,
I mean, there's plenty

49:53.097 --> 49:55.932
of green and clean technologies

49:55.965 --> 49:58.736
you know, that came up after you
lost your little shop.

50:01.372 --> 50:06.778
But that's okay.
It's Rita's favorite.

50:07.445 --> 50:08.380
Oh.

50:10.113 --> 50:15.352
Well, maybe, you're gonna have
to tell Rita that in Heaven.

50:17.021 --> 50:18.856
I mean,
you don't even know this,

50:19.356 --> 50:21.892
but Rita kicked the bucket
this week.

50:23.059 --> 50:26.797
My dear,
I'm on the way to Ransom.

50:28.698 --> 50:29.800
No, you're not.

50:32.403 --> 50:34.005
Sherman is doing her, in house.

50:35.673 --> 50:41.713
Shanrock came personally.
And he begged me.

50:43.680 --> 50:45.784
He begged me to do her hair.

50:47.117 --> 50:48.018
Really?

50:48.718 --> 50:54.892
In death, Rita remembered
that she had taste.

50:58.162 --> 51:00.999
Taste or dementia? You decide.

51:02.999 --> 51:05.936
But anyway, you know,
whatever you gotta do

51:06.137 --> 51:07.539
to feel good about yourself.

51:11.041 --> 51:16.414
Guess what, I'm gonna give
this to you for 2.49.

51:16.646 --> 51:19.416
That's a dead stock discount.

51:22.586 --> 51:23.788
Oh, you don't have the money?

51:24.521 --> 51:29.526
Aw, I'm sorry.
I can't give it to you.

51:29.860 --> 51:30.995
Because guess what,

51:31.561 --> 51:33.997
I'm still waiting
for my last three paychecks.

51:37.635 --> 51:41.139
All right... silly!

51:42.472 --> 51:44.007
So it's...
I'm gonna give it to you.

51:46.477 --> 51:47.912
It's just, I mean, I...

51:48.579 --> 51:53.051
I don't know how much it's gonna
do you because, you know...

51:54.184 --> 51:55.552
all the bald spots.

52:13.637 --> 52:16.140
<i>I didn't steal Rita
from you, Mister Pat.</i>

52:19.108 --> 52:23.514
You dropped the ball
and I was there to catch it.

52:34.224 --> 52:37.094
Eunice?

52:39.028 --> 52:40.164
Eunice!

53:00.651 --> 53:02.486
<i>WCPZ...</i>

53:09.793 --> 53:12.162
Hmm.

53:22.171 --> 53:25.175
- You made me blonde.
- Excuse me?

53:25.543 --> 53:27.512
I wasn't sure at first,

53:27.544 --> 53:30.914
but then I saw the rings
and I knew.

53:31.414 --> 53:34.017
I came to you
when I was nineteen. Remember?

53:34.885 --> 53:37.588
Yes.

53:37.621 --> 53:39.090
I wouldn't think
you would remember.

53:39.122 --> 53:40.691
I only came in there once.

53:42.159 --> 53:43.193
I'm sorry.

53:43.561 --> 53:45.829
Are you kidding me?
You were wonderful.

53:46.363 --> 53:48.600
I had a young one
at the time

53:48.832 --> 53:51.202
and I couldn't keep up
with the blonde maintenance.

53:51.235 --> 53:56.207
Or the price, as I recall.
You weren't cheap.

53:56.874 --> 54:00.645
No?

54:02.313 --> 54:04.715
I'm surprised
you still remember me.

54:05.582 --> 54:08.952
Who could forget the
"Liberace of Sandusky?"

54:09.519 --> 54:12.990
Was I that butch?

54:14.892 --> 54:16.594
Can I help you find something?

54:17.160 --> 54:19.664
How about everything?

54:19.997 --> 54:23.301
Oh! Give me one second.

54:37.381 --> 54:38.216
Ta-da!

54:40.184 --> 54:42.653
I've been saving it
for the right customer.

54:43.854 --> 54:44.789
Try it on?

54:49.093 --> 54:50.628
So, how's it fitting?

54:51.160 --> 54:53.298
Not sure
I can still pull it off.

54:53.530 --> 54:54.998
Show me.

55:02.805 --> 55:04.675
Don't move.

55:18.822 --> 55:20.691
The icing on the cake.

55:29.332 --> 55:31.135
You're starting
to look like you again.

55:33.037 --> 55:34.138
Thank you, Sue.

55:36.773 --> 55:38.375
How did you know my name?

55:39.443 --> 55:41.379
You came for a perm

55:41.412 --> 55:43.982
and I talked you
into a "Dorothy Hamill."

55:45.048 --> 55:49.186
And you told me that you
dropped out of nursing school

55:49.452 --> 55:51.121
because you got pregnant.

55:51.755 --> 55:55.360
And the name of your son,
is Danny.

55:56.727 --> 55:59.263
You know, sometimes,
it takes a while.

55:59.563 --> 56:02.800
But it's all up there somewhere.

56:05.068 --> 56:07.137
My husband thought
the "Dorothy Hamill" cut

56:07.171 --> 56:08.673
was too short, by the way.

56:10.173 --> 56:14.945
But, looking back...
I never felt prettier.

56:17.280 --> 56:19.016
It's still in there.

56:19.483 --> 56:22.387
I wish.

56:24.722 --> 56:26.290
I must tell you something.

56:30.026 --> 56:31.963
I don't have any money.

56:46.008 --> 56:47.211
- Hello.
- Hello.

57:04.994 --> 57:06.229
Sandusky.

57:29.919 --> 57:32.055
Sandusky!

57:36.360 --> 57:37.428
Pat is back.

57:55.044 --> 57:56.880
It's a win-win proposition.

57:58.416 --> 58:00.017
We...
We'll sharpen our pencils

58:00.050 --> 58:01.385
and make it happen.

58:01.718 --> 58:05.790
Uh, that's the funeral home.
Let me circle back to you later.

58:06.856 --> 58:07.925
Mr. Ransom.

58:09.992 --> 58:12.262
No, it's 50 extra chairs,
not 30.

58:13.162 --> 58:14.298
She was very specific.

58:16.432 --> 58:18.936
Oh, I appreciate you going
the extra mile for grandma.

58:20.102 --> 58:21.305
Thank you, sir.

58:23.273 --> 58:24.142
Hello?

58:26.008 --> 58:27.311
I can still see you there.

58:31.314 --> 58:34.385
- What do you want?
- I'm the hairdresser.

58:36.019 --> 58:37.488
Oh my God. Pat?

58:39.956 --> 58:41.092
I'm Dustin.

58:42.191 --> 58:43.527
Rita's grandson.

58:45.061 --> 58:46.797
So nice to finally meet you!

58:47.398 --> 58:49.499
I remember when you were born.

58:52.336 --> 58:55.372
Well, this calls for a highball.
Please.

58:58.474 --> 59:00.177
Welcome. Please, come in.

59:03.046 --> 59:04.148
Thank you.

59:12.088 --> 59:13.857
We had hospice in the home.

59:16.325 --> 59:17.260
Come.

59:43.052 --> 59:44.321
Did you style her wedding?

59:44.889 --> 59:47.325
All three of them.

59:58.468 --> 01:00:01.272
Grandma chose all the photos
for her funeral display.

01:00:09.345 --> 01:00:12.483
She was...
She was quite the perfectionist.

01:00:12.782 --> 01:00:14.485
Is that what you call it?

01:00:19.189 --> 01:00:21.158
So, how did you put up
with her all those years?

01:00:22.459 --> 01:00:26.130
Canadian whiskey. Rocks.

01:00:27.064 --> 01:00:28.966
I'll get it.

01:00:33.436 --> 01:00:35.305
You must have some
great memories of this house.

01:00:36.606 --> 01:00:39.176
I never set foot inside.

01:00:39.776 --> 01:00:41.178
What?

01:00:45.215 --> 01:00:46.483
What about all those parties?

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:54.025
I always knew my place.

01:00:57.427 --> 01:00:58.428
I'll get some ice.

01:01:41.872 --> 01:01:43.341
<i>You have reached
Rita Parker Sloan.</i>

01:01:43.807 --> 01:01:45.309
<i>Please leave a message,</i>

01:01:45.809 --> 01:01:48.379
<i>and I shall return your call
at my earliest convenience.</i>

01:02:03.492 --> 01:02:04.361
Pat?

01:02:19.776 --> 01:02:22.345
Another double, please.

01:02:22.378 --> 01:02:25.115
- Oh, thirsty, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

01:02:27.184 --> 01:02:28.753
In five minutes...

01:02:30.419 --> 01:02:34.025
I'm supposed to make a
dead bitch look human.

01:02:37.293 --> 01:02:40.263
Not sure
I'm up for the challenge.

01:02:40.664 --> 01:02:44.334
At least she won't complain.

01:02:44.601 --> 01:02:46.236
For once.

01:02:46.269 --> 01:02:47.772
Was she a handful?

01:02:48.104 --> 01:02:51.775
Oh! A demanding,
Republican monster,

01:02:51.807 --> 01:02:56.813
but she had great taste,
in shoes.

01:02:56.847 --> 01:02:59.650
Sounds like a nightmare.

01:03:03.787 --> 01:03:05.523
I adored her.

01:03:18.735 --> 01:03:20.838
Nobody remembers me.

01:03:22.771 --> 01:03:27.577
I used to perform here...
every Saturday night.

01:03:27.778 --> 01:03:30.481
Really?
What was your drag name?

01:03:30.514 --> 01:03:31.814
Mister Pat.

01:03:31.847 --> 01:03:34.684
Must have been before my time.

01:03:35.285 --> 01:03:39.423
Yes. It was before
you were conceived.

01:03:40.090 --> 01:03:42.693
- You see that stage?
- Uh-huh.

01:03:44.427 --> 01:03:50.367
My lover, David, built that.
He was, uh, very handy.

01:03:52.468 --> 01:03:55.171
In more ways than one.

01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:00.243
I sewed the curtains,

01:04:00.276 --> 01:04:04.180
and Eunice
put the glitter in the paint.

01:04:04.213 --> 01:04:09.552
Every queen in town pitched
in to open this dump.

01:04:09.753 --> 01:04:15.526
But maybe you're too young
to know who Tim and Mike was.

01:04:15.559 --> 01:04:16.794
They opened the bar.

01:04:17.961 --> 01:04:21.564
There were so many people
I remember.

01:04:21.798 --> 01:04:26.137
Miss Cheesecake, Dirty Ankle?

01:04:26.637 --> 01:04:31.775
And there was one very
interesting customer.

01:04:32.742 --> 01:04:33.878
Harry.

01:04:34.611 --> 01:04:40.383
He was a truck driver
and he came every Saturday

01:04:41.218 --> 01:04:42.820
to see me perform.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:48.159
"Mister Pat."
He was very nice.

01:04:50.459 --> 01:04:53.563
Well, I heard
that most of the regulars

01:04:53.597 --> 01:04:56.233
stopped coming out. But...
But maybe your friends will

01:04:56.265 --> 01:04:59.336
will make it tonight,
for old times' sake.

01:05:12.448 --> 01:05:14.450
This place was family.

01:05:19.488 --> 01:05:21.724
What's happened with
the crystal chandelier,

01:05:22.092 --> 01:05:24.494
that hung above the dance floor?

01:05:24.526 --> 01:05:27.463
It got old. They took it down.

01:05:27.764 --> 01:05:28.731
Huh.

01:05:29.231 --> 01:05:32.969
Another of Rita's hand-me-downs.

01:05:35.671 --> 01:05:40.276
If she would have known,
what these crystals have seen.

01:05:41.278 --> 01:05:42.213
Oh!

01:05:50.387 --> 01:05:53.756
- What? Where?
- Tonight's the last night.

01:05:54.957 --> 01:05:56.459
I don't understand.

01:05:56.726 --> 01:05:59.363
Harvey sold out to
some young gay couple.

01:05:59.396 --> 01:06:01.298
They're turning
the whole building into this

01:06:01.331 --> 01:06:03.733
straight, gastro micro brew pub.

01:06:03.967 --> 01:06:05.635
"Gastro" what?

01:06:05.836 --> 01:06:09.939
They are installing giant tanks
to brew artisan craft beer.

01:06:12.374 --> 01:06:13.776
But where will we dance?

01:06:25.988 --> 01:06:32.862
- Here. Keep the change.
- Hey, big spender.

01:06:46.175 --> 01:06:50.581
<i>I'm back.</i>

01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:53.583
<i>Why don't you see me?</i>

01:06:55.084 --> 01:06:56.486
<i>I'm right here.</i>

01:06:58.655 --> 01:07:05.296
Oh. Oh. Oh.

01:07:08.631 --> 01:07:10.801
<i>Pick it up, guys.
We're falling behind.</i>

01:07:18.508 --> 01:07:23.314
Send that arrangement back.
Everything must be perfect.

01:07:24.747 --> 01:07:28.918
Taxi!

01:07:32.756 --> 01:07:35.059
- Where to?
- I don't know. Just drive!

01:07:38.727 --> 01:07:39.896
<i>Grandma chose all the photos</i>

01:07:39.928 --> 01:07:41.731
<i>for her funeral display.</i>

01:07:41.764 --> 01:07:42.898
<i>Rita wants
to make things right.</i>

01:07:42.932 --> 01:07:44.368
<i>God forbid</i>

01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:47.470
<i>you ever listen
to anybody about anything.</i>

01:08:48.697 --> 01:08:49.899
Eunice?

01:08:52.234 --> 01:08:53.469
Eunice.

01:08:54.504 --> 01:08:55.939
Yeah?

01:08:59.875 --> 01:09:01.477
Holy hell!

01:09:02.745 --> 01:09:05.782
Pat, you're still alive?

01:09:06.549 --> 01:09:10.786
- You're still sucking cock?
- Christ on the cross, queen.

01:09:10.819 --> 01:09:12.688
A bitch can't even
powder her nose

01:09:12.721 --> 01:09:14.590
without getting
the third degree.

01:09:15.558 --> 01:09:18.761
Now, step back,
lemme get a good look at you.

01:09:20.129 --> 01:09:22.866
You look fantastic.

01:09:25.868 --> 01:09:31.875
Shit, I just saw your shoes.

01:09:33.843 --> 01:09:37.180
Oh baby, I missed you.

01:09:37.212 --> 01:09:39.916
I missed you too.
Don't overdo it.

01:09:39.948 --> 01:09:41.617
Oh, I always do.

01:09:42.885 --> 01:09:43.786
Hmm.

01:09:45.254 --> 01:09:49.792
I heard the Fruit and Nut
is closing. You going?

01:09:51.693 --> 01:09:53.196
I haven't set foot in years.

01:09:55.197 --> 01:09:56.200
Why not?

01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:59.769
Gay bars are so '90s.

01:10:00.504 --> 01:10:03.039
The Velvet Slipper's gone
in Lorain

01:10:03.071 --> 01:10:05.641
and the bar in Mansfield's
about to close too.

01:10:06.776 --> 01:10:08.945
- Our safe places.
- Mm-hmm.

01:10:08.978 --> 01:10:10.780
I mean, who needs
the Fruit and Nut

01:10:10.812 --> 01:10:13.182
when they can
hold hands at Applebee's?

01:10:15.384 --> 01:10:17.487
Besides, that place
made me a goddamn drunk.

01:10:21.924 --> 01:10:25.962
Do you remember what we
performed for the opening night?

01:10:26.995 --> 01:10:29.832
Oh, and thank God
I talked you out

01:10:29.866 --> 01:10:31.602
of that Marlene Dietrich number.

01:10:32.102 --> 01:10:36.173
But your Shirley Bassey
routine brought down the house!

01:10:36.805 --> 01:10:40.843
And you did both,
the Peaches and Herb.

01:10:41.643 --> 01:10:44.046
- At the same time.
- At the same time.

01:10:46.348 --> 01:10:49.818
Girl, you taught me everything
I never wanted to know.

01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:53.689
- You got a call.
- Oops.

01:10:57.893 --> 01:11:00.897
- One of your boys?
- Lemme tell ya something.

01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:04.700
The trade on here,
would make your head spin.

01:11:06.001 --> 01:11:07.102
Show me.

01:11:07.135 --> 01:11:09.540
Ah!

01:11:09.973 --> 01:11:14.311
I do better on here,
than I ever did in the bars.

01:11:14.678 --> 01:11:19.916
Yet, here you are,
cruising the tearoom.

01:11:19.948 --> 01:11:24.120
I like to cover my bases.

01:11:24.152 --> 01:11:25.955
What on earth?

01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:32.628
What on earth are they doing?

01:11:33.963 --> 01:11:35.866
These daddies with their...

01:11:36.398 --> 01:11:38.000
- babies.
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:40.704 --> 01:11:43.639
I wouldn't even know
how to be gay anymore.

01:11:45.107 --> 01:11:49.078
Tell that to your pantsuit.

01:11:53.683 --> 01:11:55.652
Great. Great job, buddy.

01:12:04.059 --> 01:12:05.329
I'm happy for them.

01:12:06.896 --> 01:12:08.898
And jealous as hell.

01:12:09.265 --> 01:12:11.300
Those kids will remember them,

01:12:11.701 --> 01:12:14.104
long after they have gone.

01:12:15.838 --> 01:12:17.707
And who will remember us?

01:12:19.409 --> 01:12:22.813
- You left a big mark.
- On who?

01:12:23.213 --> 01:12:25.948
Those gay dads should
drop to their knees

01:12:25.982 --> 01:12:27.884
and kiss your rings.

01:12:29.218 --> 01:12:30.621
Which one?

01:12:31.088 --> 01:12:35.258
Especially the cubic zirconia
on your left ring finger.

01:12:35.890 --> 01:12:39.129
'Cause bitch, you know that's
the only one that's real.

01:12:44.267 --> 01:12:46.403
You evil bitch.

01:12:50.205 --> 01:12:52.074
I went to see David today.

01:12:54.777 --> 01:12:56.246
Is he still dead?

01:12:59.314 --> 01:13:01.418
My name was on the tombstone.

01:13:02.951 --> 01:13:05.988
No shit.
You paid for the damn thing.

01:13:06.621 --> 01:13:09.191
Today was
the first time I saw it.

01:13:09.659 --> 01:13:14.031
Don't tell me, you are
still mad at that old whore.

01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:21.071
Jesus, honey,
when are you gonna move on?

01:13:26.342 --> 01:13:29.344
Why didn't you tell me
about my house?

01:13:29.378 --> 01:13:32.148
I went there.
There was nothing there.

01:13:36.451 --> 01:13:39.722
You don't tell someone
in the goddamn nursing home

01:13:39.755 --> 01:13:41.691
their house has been demolished.

01:13:42.357 --> 01:13:43.994
It's bad etiquette.

01:13:44.827 --> 01:13:48.064
But you could have come
and said, "Hi."

01:13:51.968 --> 01:13:53.836
At least you had a home.

01:13:57.072 --> 01:13:58.275
And a David.

01:14:01.477 --> 01:14:05.849
I had a house, and a David.

01:14:06.848 --> 01:14:08.718
And both are gone.

01:14:10.018 --> 01:14:11.287
But you are here.

01:14:17.893 --> 01:14:19.262
You're not gone.

01:14:25.468 --> 01:14:26.503
Eunice.

01:14:30.205 --> 01:14:31.307
Eunice.

01:14:37.513 --> 01:14:41.751
And you old bitch,
sitting next to me.

01:15:28.897 --> 01:15:30.933
How did it go?

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.936
I quit the bitch.

01:15:36.339 --> 01:15:38.441
Frozen fucking pizza lit
the toaster oven on fire.

01:15:38.473 --> 01:15:40.175
But I extinguished
the blaze, girl.

01:15:40.209 --> 01:15:43.412
- I am here, I am alive!
- And did you select a song?

01:15:43.979 --> 01:15:46.316
I barely survive
a DiGiorno inferno

01:15:46.348 --> 01:15:48.384
and you trifle me
for song selection?

01:15:48.684 --> 01:15:51.153
Shame on you, Gabriel. Shame.

01:15:53.054 --> 01:15:54.523
Is Velma all right?

01:15:54.557 --> 01:15:59.362
One Coco Roco
and she will be just fine.

01:16:14.677 --> 01:16:16.179
Look like you seen a ghost.

01:16:18.147 --> 01:16:20.216
Gabriel sent on me
to check on you.

01:16:23.286 --> 01:16:25.055
I dropped this bitch
on a Crockpot.

01:16:25.554 --> 01:16:28.057
It's the last night,
I have no idea what I'm doing.

01:16:28.089 --> 01:16:30.125
Take the edge off.

01:16:53.249 --> 01:16:55.452
Gorgeous skin.

01:17:00.089 --> 01:17:03.026
- Where are you from?
- Hancock Street.

01:17:03.058 --> 01:17:04.192
Nice.

01:17:04.226 --> 01:17:05.428
You been there lately?

01:17:07.263 --> 01:17:10.567
- Been performing long?
- Two years.

01:17:10.832 --> 01:17:14.070
I finally start to get good
and they close the damn bar.

01:17:16.405 --> 01:17:17.573
What's your act?

01:17:19.342 --> 01:17:21.143
Batten down the hatches, boys,

01:17:21.443 --> 01:17:27.483
man your harpoons and make way
for Miss Velma Humpback!

01:17:27.717 --> 01:17:30.653
- <i>"Thar she blows!"</i>
- Aw, yes, queen.

01:17:31.388 --> 01:17:34.424
Forget this little town,
Miss Velma.

01:17:34.956 --> 01:17:37.026
You'd be big in Cleveland.

01:17:37.058 --> 01:17:39.929
Well, ain't you
just the sweetest thing?

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:08.457
- Oh, hell no.
- Sit down. Close your eyes.

01:18:08.491 --> 01:18:11.561
I'm a professional. No peeking.

01:18:27.442 --> 01:18:29.378
No peeking.

01:18:42.691 --> 01:18:46.629
Voila.

01:19:14.590 --> 01:19:19.661
- I love your rings.
- Thanks. Each one has a story.

01:19:19.695 --> 01:19:21.764
Oh yeah? What are they?

01:19:23.299 --> 01:19:24.701
I don't remember.

01:20:00.803 --> 01:20:03.473
I forgot how much
I missed this.

01:20:03.505 --> 01:20:05.842
- Dancing?
- Our people!

01:21:35.665 --> 01:21:37.200
Slay, girl!

01:22:36.491 --> 01:22:37.492
Sir.

01:22:38.227 --> 01:22:40.662
Sir, you sustained
a serious head injury!

01:22:40.696 --> 01:22:42.365
Please get back in your room.

01:22:43.398 --> 01:22:45.000
I'm late for my funeral.

01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:46.969
Sir,
get your ass back here.

01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:34.317
Get the hell out of the way.

01:24:04.646 --> 01:24:07.416
Bitch.

01:24:16.592 --> 01:24:21.630
Sherman.
I'm... I'm sorry!

01:24:22.330 --> 01:24:25.034
You're too late.

01:24:29.604 --> 01:24:32.008
Oh. Hey, Pat.

01:24:33.976 --> 01:24:35.777
She's a real hot mess in there.

01:24:37.179 --> 01:24:38.881
Total resting bitch face.

01:24:41.150 --> 01:24:43.986
Resting dead bitch face.

01:24:54.662 --> 01:24:55.964
She needs your touch.

01:26:05.099 --> 01:26:06.602
Get Dee Dee back.

01:26:10.772 --> 01:26:12.508
Don't you dare.

01:26:20.281 --> 01:26:22.184
Dee Dee would do a better job.

01:26:23.117 --> 01:26:24.187
Bullshit.

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:27.556
I didn't know
that you looked that bad.

01:26:28.290 --> 01:26:30.493
Well then fix me, goddammit.

01:26:34.963 --> 01:26:39.936
When David died,
you didn't come to the funeral.

01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:46.508
And now you want me
to rescue yours?

01:26:47.776 --> 01:26:50.546
Pat, for Christ's sake,
I never even met David.

01:26:51.647 --> 01:26:53.515
We talked about him,

01:26:53.715 --> 01:26:58.920
every Friday at 4:00
for 33 years.

01:27:02.189 --> 01:27:04.227
You know,
I don't do well at funerals.

01:27:05.826 --> 01:27:07.062
Really?

01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:11.032
I adore them.

01:27:12.334 --> 01:27:14.036
You're not making this easy,
Patrick.

01:27:14.068 --> 01:27:15.871
I'm trying to make this right.

01:27:18.839 --> 01:27:20.642
I know I was your servant...

01:27:22.844 --> 01:27:25.848
but I thought I was your friend.

01:27:26.348 --> 01:27:29.051
You knew every
goddamn secret I ever had.

01:27:30.585 --> 01:27:32.787
And you never listened once
to mine.

01:27:33.155 --> 01:27:35.558
It was another world
back then, Pat.

01:27:35.857 --> 01:27:37.893
People evolve, they let go.

01:27:39.894 --> 01:27:41.296
Maybe you should too.

01:27:45.032 --> 01:27:46.736
Have a fun funeral.

01:27:47.603 --> 01:27:49.939
I was embarrassed! Okay?

01:27:52.139 --> 01:27:54.110
About how David died.

01:28:01.249 --> 01:28:02.885
When I did let you know...

01:28:04.686 --> 01:28:06.121
how much it hurt...

01:28:07.356 --> 01:28:10.693
...that you weren't there.

01:28:11.559 --> 01:28:15.764
Because I needed you there
at that moment.

01:28:18.967 --> 01:28:20.036
Where were you?

01:28:22.269 --> 01:28:25.240
I left you.

01:28:25.773 --> 01:28:28.143
And the whole town followed.

01:28:36.317 --> 01:28:37.652
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:28:41.255 --> 01:28:43.625
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:29:06.947 --> 01:29:08.249
I forgive you.

01:29:11.286 --> 01:29:12.755
I forgive you.

01:29:17.259 --> 01:29:19.895
You're going to be beautiful.

01:29:20.327 --> 01:29:22.263
I'll make you beautiful.

01:29:23.397 --> 01:29:24.666
Yes.

01:33:43.625 --> 01:33:44.994
Pat.

01:34:03.445 --> 01:34:04.345
Thank you.

01:34:10.184 --> 01:34:11.387
May I share something with you?

01:34:17.192 --> 01:34:21.029
I was 15 when Grandma Rita
sat me down

01:34:21.062 --> 01:34:26.969
and asked me if there was
anything I needed to tell her.

01:34:30.104 --> 01:34:31.406
We were so conservative.

01:34:37.045 --> 01:34:39.048
I was scared to death
to tell her the truth.

01:34:41.616 --> 01:34:43.719
But finally...

01:34:46.521 --> 01:34:47.555
I did.

01:34:51.759 --> 01:34:53.528
"Don't worry," she said.

01:34:56.130 --> 01:34:58.133
"My best friend's gay too."

01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:05.073
We stayed up all night.

01:35:07.041 --> 01:35:10.345
She told me all about
you and David.

01:35:21.121 --> 01:35:23.258
<i>Even though
I never really knew you...</i>

01:35:27.394 --> 01:35:29.630
<i>I want you to know
you changed my life.</i>

01:37:05.559 --> 01:37:08.763
<i>Oh, baby, I missed you.</i>

01:37:08.795 --> 01:37:10.465
<i>Hey, mister.</i>

01:44:55.062 --> 01:44:56.665
<i>Bye, everybody!</i>

01:44:58.064 --> 01:45:00.268
Come and see me sometimes.

01:45:04.498 --> 01:45:06.250
