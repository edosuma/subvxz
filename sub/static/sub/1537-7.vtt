00:02.235 --> 00:04.269
Morning.

00:04.271 --> 00:05.604
Who are those for?

00:05.606 --> 00:07.439
Captain holt's uncle
passed away.

00:07.441 --> 00:10.142
They weren't close,
but I wanted to do something.

00:10.144 --> 00:11.443
Interesting.

00:11.445 --> 00:14.179
Flowers are a bold choice,
santiago,

00:14.181 --> 00:15.647
But I can still beat you.

00:15.649 --> 00:18.250
Beat me
at expressing condolences?

00:18.252 --> 00:22.287
Flowers are a gift,
and captain holt hates gifts.

00:22.289 --> 00:25.024
I think a thoughtful email
is the way to go here.

00:25.026 --> 00:28.260
"dear captain, we were all
so sorry for your loss."

00:28.262 --> 00:30.362
Group sentiment,
very meaningful.

00:30.364 --> 00:33.265
"please let us know if there's
anything we can do."

00:33.267 --> 00:34.266
Selfless act.

00:34.268 --> 00:35.768
Very respectful.

00:35.770 --> 00:39.471
Correct, I am the king
of respectfulness, bitches!

00:39.473 --> 00:42.241
Hey, did you send that from
your personal or work account?

00:42.243 --> 00:43.776
Personal--
it's a personal matter

00:43.778 --> 00:46.311
Involving a personal friend
and his personal uncle.

00:46.313 --> 00:48.714
So you remembered to turn off
your signature, right?

00:48.716 --> 00:50.282
Oh, no.

00:51.384 --> 00:52.584
[knocking]

00:52.586 --> 00:54.753
Hey, captain, I just
sent you an email, uh--

00:54.755 --> 00:57.556
"dear captain, we were all
so sorry for your loss.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.358
"please let us know
if there's anything we can do.

00:59.360 --> 01:02.127
Sent from my stinky butt."

01:02.129 --> 01:03.362
I was hacked?

01:03.364 --> 01:05.597
Thank you for the email.
It means a lot to me.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.466
[sighs]
you're very welcome.

01:07.468 --> 01:09.201
I was addressing
your stinky butt.

captain and I are going

01:33.327 --> 01:35.327
To a charity event
in brighton beach.

01:35.329 --> 01:36.361
Have a great thanksgiving.

Ahem.

Sorry, boyle.
Turkey day.

Once sergeant jeffords and I

01:40.234 --> 01:42.334
Peralta will be
the officer in command.

Jake in charge.
No-look five.

Do you have a scandalous past?

01:53.247 --> 01:56.515
The scar extends
through the lobe into the neck.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.183
No one likes it
when you do that.

01:58.185 --> 01:59.651
Anyway, thank you for taking
command of the precinct

01:59.653 --> 02:00.652
Over the holiday.

02:00.654 --> 02:01.720
Not a problem.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.388
As you all know,
I hate thanksgiving.

02:03.390 --> 02:06.291
The pilgrims were murderers,
and turkey tastes like napkins.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.494
I just hope
that no amys feel bad

02:08.496 --> 02:10.662
That I was chosen over amy.

02:10.663 --> 02:13.298
Actually, captain asked me
first, but I had plans.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.868
Teddy brewed a thanksgiving
pilsner, and it's bottling day.

02:15.870 --> 02:16.869
Bottling day?

02:16.871 --> 02:18.303
Why'd you come in at all?

02:18.305 --> 02:19.671
And frankly, sir,
I'm a little hurt

02:19.673 --> 02:21.473
That I wasn't your top choice
to be in charge.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.741
I'd like to remind you
of what happened

02:22.743 --> 02:24.476
When I asked you to run
the blood drive.

02:24.478 --> 02:27.446
So I forgot to put up
the posters, and no one came,

02:27.448 --> 02:30.349
But don't worry,
because I donated 5 pints

02:30.351 --> 02:33.519
All by me-self.

02:33.521 --> 02:35.220
It's one 12-hour shift.

is gonna happen?

you're under my command.

And as leader,
it is my job

02:50.437 --> 02:52.237
To make my employees' lives
better,

02:52.239 --> 02:55.240
So what can I do for you?
Gina?

02:55.242 --> 02:58.944
I would like to answer the phone
always just like, "eh-heh?"

02:58.946 --> 03:03.415
Lift the precinct-wide ban on me
saying the word "succulent."

03:03.417 --> 03:04.483
Done.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.852
So I don't have to hear
charles say "succulent."

03:06.854 --> 03:11.456
Can I move my nap couch
out into the bullpen?

03:11.458 --> 03:15.394
Oh, so your plan is to not
take this seriously at all?

03:15.396 --> 03:16.828
Oh, I am as serious
as a heart attack.

03:16.830 --> 03:19.631
Eh, mine are never
that serious.

03:19.633 --> 03:20.666
I call 'em "oopsies."

You can't just grant wishes,

Who likes me being in charge?

Succulent.

03:31.512 --> 03:33.612
Thanks for coming
to this event, sergeant.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.447
Always happy to spend time
with you, sir.

03:35.449 --> 03:38.884
Plus, the longer I stay out
of my house today, the better.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.420
My brother-in-law zeke
is in town.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.855
Oh, I remember zeke.
Large gentleman.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.891
Calls you tiny terry.

Also teensy terry,
teeny-weeny terry-berry,

03:49.330 --> 03:50.896
And li'l dum-dum.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.731
You know, it's the lack
of effort on that last one

03:52.733 --> 03:54.333
That really gets me.

03:54.335 --> 03:57.302
You're a grown man, sergeant,
strong like an oak.

03:57.304 --> 03:58.604
That's a pretty good tree.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.639
It's a mighty tree.

04:00.641 --> 04:03.342
So why not stand up
to this zeke?

04:03.344 --> 04:05.410
I get so intimidated
around him.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.481
Thanks for the sandwich,
li'l dum-dum.

04:11.018 --> 04:13.952
Why didn't you just volunteer
to run the precinct

04:13.954 --> 04:15.387
Instead of peralta?

04:15.389 --> 04:17.356
I'd much rather
have you in charge.

04:17.358 --> 04:20.291
Don't worry about jake.
He's gonna do great.

04:20.293 --> 04:22.461
He can be very responsible.

Okay, the elevator door
is the goal.

04:33.907 --> 04:36.808
I'm gonna go home
and stuff my goose.

04:37.744 --> 04:40.345
Wait, boyle, powder.
What is that powder?

04:40.347 --> 04:40.812
I don't know.
I don't know, what do we do?

04:46.019 --> 04:48.520
<i>(jake)</i>
<i>okay, everyone,</i>
<i>we are in lockdown,</i>

04:48.522 --> 04:51.390
Which means no one can come
in or out of the precinct.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.592
<i>Now, apparently,</i>
<i>three other precincts received</i>

04:53.594 --> 04:54.693
<i>Similar packages this month,</i>

04:54.695 --> 04:56.061
<i>And they were all</i>
<i>baking powder.</i>

04:56.063 --> 04:58.930
Nevertheless, hazmat
has to run a quick test,

04:58.932 --> 05:01.333
But I anticipate we'll all
be out of here momentarily.

05:01.335 --> 05:04.670
In the meantime,
I suggest we turn this lockdown

05:04.672 --> 05:06.638
Into a pop-and-lockdown.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.674
Right?
Am I right?

05:08.676 --> 05:10.075
<i>Huh?</i>

05:10.077 --> 05:12.944
Okay, so I'll keep
everyone updated,

05:12.946 --> 05:14.880
And keep working
on your dance moves.

05:14.882 --> 05:18.317
Jake, what are you doing?
This is a crisis.

05:18.319 --> 05:21.620
Because hazmat said
it's almost definitely a hoax.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.789
Almost?
What if it's anthrax?

05:23.791 --> 05:26.525
We are all 100% gonna die!

05:26.527 --> 05:27.926
Guys!
You're freaking people out.

05:27.928 --> 05:31.330
Can you please calm it down?
We're doing fine here.

05:31.332 --> 05:32.431
Not hitchcock.

05:32.433 --> 05:33.899
He got trapped
out on the balcony.

05:33.901 --> 05:36.068
I don't like him alone
out there, not with his history.

05:36.070 --> 05:37.903
I mean, what if he
gets up on a ledge?

05:37.905 --> 05:39.404
What, you think
he's gonna jump?

05:39.406 --> 05:43.875
He's got a worm living in his
ear that affects his balance.

05:43.877 --> 05:47.412
Oh, well, then he's not
truly alone out there, right?

05:47.414 --> 05:49.381
Okay, I'm gonna call holt.
You want to come?

05:49.383 --> 05:50.415
Yeah.
Too bad, you're not invited.

05:50.417 --> 05:52.551

under control.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.760
I want to monitor
the situation.

06:01.762 --> 06:04.029
I need to get somewhere
with an internet connection

06:04.031 --> 06:06.431
And a landline.

06:06.433 --> 06:09.000
You live out here.

Well, yeah, but zeke is
in that room, and--

06:11.372 --> 06:12.804
Perfect.
Let's go there.

06:12.806 --> 06:13.939
Or my neighbors
are out of town.

06:13.941 --> 06:16.541
We could break
into their place.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.378
Fine, we'll go to my house.

06:19.380 --> 06:23.715
Or as zeke calls it,
tiny terry's hobbit hole.

06:23.717 --> 06:27.152
All right, sorry for the delay,
but I have some news.

06:27.154 --> 06:29.921
I gotta say,
your hazmat suit is super scary.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.423
You should talk
in a silly voice,

06:31.425 --> 06:32.424
So you seem less terrifying.

06:32.426 --> 06:33.825
Well, we ran our test.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.093
See, even that would be
much less ominous

06:35.095 --> 06:36.528
If you just did
a grover voice.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.163
[imitating grover]
well, we ran our tests.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.664
And it's not baking powder.

06:39.666 --> 06:40.866
There's a chance
it's toxic.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.501
[grover voice]
what?

06:46.739 --> 06:48.039
We know it's not baking powder.

Sir, you shouldn't have to be
below eye level,

06:52.413 --> 06:54.479
So I'm gonna hold you up.

06:54.481 --> 06:56.748
Okay, you do look good
in amy's purple shirt.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.016
Anyways, it's thanksgiving,

06:58.018 --> 07:00.685
So the emergency services lab
is closed.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.454
They're gonna reopen them,
but it'll be at least five hours

07:02.456 --> 07:04.022
Till they can run
detailed tests.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.690
Boyle, status report?

07:05.692 --> 07:07.058
We're locked down
with 42 civilians,

07:07.060 --> 07:08.827
Divided into four factions.

07:08.829 --> 07:11.596
First, we have 12 perps
locked up in holding.

<i>Couple food delivery guys.</i>

07:21.542 --> 07:24.009
Great, we'll refer to them
as the normies.

<i>(charles)</i>
<i>third faction is trouble:</i>
<i>Your snitches, your suspects,</i>

07:31.985 --> 07:33.518
Permission denied.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.053
We will refer to them
exclusively

07:35.055 --> 07:36.455

Ugh,
you know what,

07:41.628 --> 07:44.863
Because that's the grossest
thing I can think of.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.665
So what's the plan?

07:46.667 --> 07:48.867
Sir, I think we should
separate the factions,

07:48.869 --> 07:50.202
So we don't become
outnumbered.

07:50.204 --> 07:51.970
We should start rationing
the food now,

07:51.972 --> 07:53.738
And we should tell people
that we're in for a long night,

07:53.740 --> 07:55.774
Because the substance
is not baking powder.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.642
Whoa, whoa, that's just gonna
freak everyone out.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.578
We want people to be
happy and calm.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.546
[gasps]
we should play them sade.

08:01.548 --> 08:03.248
<i>(holt)</i>
<i>keeping the peace is important.</i>

08:03.250 --> 08:04.850
I'm not there
to read the situation,

08:04.852 --> 08:08.220
But--and I can't believe
I'm actually saying this--

08:08.222 --> 08:12.591
I did leave peralta in charge,
so call me if you need anything.

Oh, sir, one other thing,

08:14.061 --> 08:15.994
Hitchcock got trapped
out on the balcony.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.162
Good, sounds like
we dodged a bullet there.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.997
Yeah.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.633
Diaz, santiago,
I want you out there with me,

08:21.635 --> 08:22.801
Keeping people's morale up.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.536
Boyle, you go
through security footage

08:24.538 --> 08:26.805
And see if you can see
who brought in that box.

08:26.807 --> 08:30.509
Maybe I could be your right-hand
man, your tinker bell.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.910
Let me tell you something
about tinker bell.

08:32.913 --> 08:35.013
Tinker bell is
a loyal lieutenant

08:35.015 --> 08:36.948
And a real thorn
in the side of captain hook.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.082
Fine, done,
you're my number two.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.851
Yes!
I made number two.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.921
I hear it.
Why would I ever say that?

08:42.923 --> 08:44.956
Thank you.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.625
<i>I got ahold of e.S.U.</i>

08:46.627 --> 08:48.894
The lab tech is en route
from his home in new jersey.

08:48.896 --> 08:52.163
Sergeant, is there any way
you can replace this large ball

08:52.165 --> 08:54.766
With a chair that is
actually a chair?

08:54.768 --> 08:56.701
I'm sorry, sir,
that's all I've got.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.103
But it's good for your core.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.205
Yes.
My core, it's engaged.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.073
[chuckles]
I wouldn't take fitness tips

09:02.075 --> 09:03.675
From this shrimp.

09:03.677 --> 09:06.645
Sir, you remember
my brother-in-law, zeke?

09:06.647 --> 09:07.913
Yes, hello.
<i>(zeke)</i>
<i>hey.</i>

09:07.915 --> 09:10.615
What happened to the game
I was dvr-ing?

09:10.617 --> 09:12.017
I was recording it
for later.

09:12.019 --> 09:14.119
Well, the captain wanted
to have the news on,

09:14.121 --> 09:16.721
So I stopped the recording.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.557
Well, the game was
a blowout anyway.

09:18.559 --> 09:21.660
I mean everyone died.
Sports are canceled.

09:21.662 --> 09:24.930
You better hope
that's true.

09:24.932 --> 09:25.931
[door closes]

09:25.933 --> 09:27.866
Good, he's gone.

09:27.868 --> 09:30.335
Now, let's get serious
and focus up.

09:32.738 --> 09:35.106
Just trying to get
to the printer.

09:35.942 --> 09:38.009
Hey, hey, hey, people.

09:38.011 --> 09:40.879
How about everyone come on,
bring it in here, gather around?

09:40.881 --> 09:43.148
So how we all holding up?

09:43.150 --> 09:45.817
Not good.
We're trapped on thanksgiving.

09:45.819 --> 09:46.818
What's going on, man?

09:46.820 --> 09:48.053
Okay, great,
first off,

09:48.055 --> 09:49.354
Happy thanksgiving, everyone.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.022
Shout-out to turkey.

09:51.024 --> 09:54.159
Thank you.
All right, so here's the deal.

09:54.161 --> 09:56.361
We are still awaiting
the initial test results,

09:56.363 --> 09:57.896
But hopefully,
we'll hear soon

09:57.898 --> 09:59.331
That it's all harmless
and we can all go home soon.

09:59.333 --> 10:00.332
[whispering]
you're doing a great--

10:00.334 --> 10:01.967
What are you doing?

10:01.969 --> 10:03.635
I'm whispering in your ear.
It's what a number two does.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.036
It was way too close.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.171
Can you say it quietly
to me, please?

10:06.173 --> 10:08.640
[whispering]
this is going really well.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.842
Okay.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.978
At any rate, I figured
we could pass the time

10:12.980 --> 10:14.879
And do something fun,
maybe a movie night.

10:14.881 --> 10:18.683
Our options are a bootleg copy
of the diane keaton classic,

10:18.685 --> 10:19.818
<i>Something's gotta give.</i>

10:19.820 --> 10:20.952
Movie's hilarious.

10:20.954 --> 10:21.953
Okay, surprising opinion.

10:21.955 --> 10:25.724
And our second option
is surveillance footage

10:25.726 --> 10:27.058
Of detective amy santiago
soliciting drugs

10:27.060 --> 10:30.929
It's not that weird to say,
"may I have some cocaine?"

10:30.931 --> 10:33.031
It is.
Those options suck.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.200
Fair enough, why don't we have
a talent show then?

10:35.202 --> 10:38.169
Oh, I just learned
the <i> single ladies</i> dance.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.871
Hey! Yes!

10:39.873 --> 10:40.939
[people cheering]

10:40.941 --> 10:42.641
<i>(jake)</i>
<i>people love it.</i>

10:42.643 --> 10:45.276
Look at that, two painted ladies
just joined in.

10:45.278 --> 10:46.878
<i>You got to admit,</i>

10:46.880 --> 10:49.881
<i>Boyle really knows</i>
<i>how to move his pelvis.</i>

10:49.883 --> 10:51.816
I can't believe this is
one of the last things

10:51.818 --> 10:53.752
I'm ever gonna see.

10:53.754 --> 10:59.924
Will be doctor, blood, doctor,
pus, scab, nothing.

10:59.926 --> 11:01.092
Why are you saying that?

11:01.094 --> 11:02.160
'cause you're being
melodramatic,

11:02.162 --> 11:03.161
So I'm making fun of you.
<i>Fine.</i>

11:03.163 --> 11:08.400
Say good-bye to my sculpture
of two "jag-u-ars" making love.

11:08.402 --> 11:11.302
Whoo!
This is why I became a cop.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.872
Really?
People love the talent show.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.206
Lawyer guy's doing stand-up.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.941
He's got really good material.
Oh.

11:16.943 --> 11:19.110
There are two jobs
where you have total control

11:19.112 --> 11:21.980
Over the people that pay you:
President of a country

11:21.982 --> 11:23.948
And cleaning lady.

11:23.950 --> 11:25.150
[laughter]

11:25.152 --> 11:27.752
I can't believe you gave
the mob a megaphone.

11:27.754 --> 11:29.988
Okay, first of all,
we didn't have a mic,

11:29.990 --> 11:31.823
And second,
it's not a mob.

11:31.825 --> 11:34.025
It's a happy group
of unlikely friends.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.193
(charles)
maybe not so happy.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.462
People are starting
to get hungry.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.197
Oh.
Okay, not a problem.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.466
Let's get them
some food.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.802
Voila,
a thanksgiving feast

11:43.804 --> 11:46.004
From the two delivery guys
who are trapped in here with us,

11:46.006 --> 11:48.473
And paid for by me
with boyle's money.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.075
Put it on the tab.

11:51.011 --> 11:54.012
Uh, I guess
I could have a friend

11:54.014 --> 11:56.114
Throw some pretzels up to you
from the street?

11:56.116 --> 11:57.315
And soda too?

11:57.317 --> 11:59.884
Fine, I'll have someone
blindly throw

11:59.886 --> 12:01.986
Ice-cold metal cans of soda
at you.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.724
Jake, I know you think
this is going well,

12:05.726 --> 12:07.826
But you can't keep putting out
fires as they come up.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.427
You need to set down
some rules.

12:09.429 --> 12:10.895
It's fine.
Everyone is happy.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.764
Now we just coast
to the all-clear.

12:12.766 --> 12:15.100
We're freezing in here!
We want heat!

12:15.102 --> 12:16.935
We want heat!

12:16.937 --> 12:18.770
(both)
we want heat!

12:18.772 --> 12:21.906
(all)
we want heat! We want heat!

12:21.908 --> 12:23.007
What?

12:23.009 --> 12:24.175
I'm glad I gave them
the megaphone.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.810
It helps me
hear their concerns.

12:25.812 --> 12:27.412
Now, if you'll excuse me,

12:27.414 --> 12:31.082
I need to go find
a couple bags...Of heat.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.020
Charles and I arrested a guy
a couple of years ago

12:36.022 --> 12:37.822
That was selling
knock-off designer coats.

12:37.824 --> 12:39.190
We just gotta find
the box they're in,

12:39.192 --> 12:41.025
And everyone will be
warm and happy.

12:41.027 --> 12:42.527
You can't let them
gang up on you.

12:42.529 --> 12:43.528
You need to man up.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.930
Man up?
Sexist.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.867
I'm sorry,
but I don't see gender, sir.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.268
Tell them the truth
about the powder,

12:50.270 --> 12:52.137
Tell them that
they're gonna be here awhile,

12:52.139 --> 12:53.371
And tell them
that they might have to be

12:53.373 --> 12:57.842
Uncomfortable because of how
amazing I look in this?

12:59.779 --> 13:01.279
Zeke, I'm sorry,
but captain thinks

13:01.281 --> 13:03.348
We're gonna have to use
your room for a little longer.

13:03.350 --> 13:04.349
No problem.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.351
Really?
Yeah, I feel you.

13:06.353 --> 13:09.287
I got a boss that's a jerk
like that too.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.522
Right.

13:10.524 --> 13:12.357
The captain's the worst.

13:12.359 --> 13:15.894
Sometimes, I call him
holt the dolt.

13:15.896 --> 13:18.062
[laughs]
that's cold.

13:18.064 --> 13:19.497
Stay tough, brother.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.366
Brother?

13:21.368 --> 13:23.535
Brother.
I will, brother.

13:23.537 --> 13:25.170
All right.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.437
Talk to you later, brother.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.406
See you, brother.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.942
<i>Bye, brother.</i>

13:32.178 --> 13:35.914
Okay, I have finished
my last will and testament.

13:35.916 --> 13:38.416
To rosa,
I leave you nothing.

13:38.418 --> 13:41.486
You can't pass
on me leaving you nothing.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.520
Just did.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.155
Not today, rosa.

13:44.157 --> 13:47.926
To charles, I leave you
the memories of my supple form.

13:47.928 --> 13:51.596
I'm reminding everyone
of my embarrassing sexual past

13:51.598 --> 13:53.431
'cause I'm hoping
it's the act of charity

13:53.433 --> 13:54.933
That gets me into heaven.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.434
Why is she talking
about heaven?

13:56.436 --> 13:58.436
Is there something wrong here
we don't know about?

13:58.438 --> 14:00.471
No, no, no!
She's just being a funny weirdo.

14:00.473 --> 14:03.174
More importantly,
I was not able

14:03.176 --> 14:05.510
To find any "heat"
because it's more of a concept,

14:05.512 --> 14:07.445
But we did find
these beauties.

14:07.447 --> 14:10.215
They're all faux fur
and all the best brands.

14:10.217 --> 14:14.018
We've got chanelb, grucci,
stella mccarkeys.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.520
I want the one with the muff.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.455
Great choice, sir, but there's
actually only five coats,

14:17.457 --> 14:18.990
So we're gonna have to
figure out a way to share them.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.625
I was thinking maybe
a trivia contest.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.460
Screw the coats.
I want more food.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.195
Interesting fact there--
it turns out

14:24.197 --> 14:27.265
The one-time-only feast
was all the food that we had.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.400
What?
You didn't ration the food?

14:29.402 --> 14:30.902
I'm not gonna sit here
and starve.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.203
It's thanksgiving.
You said it was a hoax.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.172
We're only here
because of some dumb protocol.

14:34.174 --> 14:37.141
I'm leaving.
I'm walking out that door.

14:37.143 --> 14:38.610
Jake, you have
to arrest him.

14:38.612 --> 14:40.144
No, it'll only
make things worse.

14:40.146 --> 14:42.180
Look, we're doing this my way.
I'm the captain now!

14:42.182 --> 14:43.948
That totally sounded
like a movie ref,

14:43.950 --> 14:46.184
But I was actually
being serious.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.586
Can I talk to you
in my office for a sec?

14:48.588 --> 14:51.656
It's nothing serious,
just a fun chat.

[whispering]
look, if you don't come with me,

I'm sort of the number two guy
around here.

15:00.333 --> 15:03.167
Okay, so first of all,
I'm just gonna set the mood

15:03.169 --> 15:05.603
For this meeting,
perhaps a smooth jam.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.472
[r&b music playing]
ahh.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.073
Yeah, it's good.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.444

some preliminary tests,

is not baking powder.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.448
Oh.
Was it anthrax?

15:17.450 --> 15:19.317
They don't know yet,
but I promise you,

15:19.319 --> 15:22.287
As soon they tell me,
you'll be the first to know.

15:22.289 --> 15:23.554
Well, second after me,
so third overall.

15:23.556 --> 15:24.689
Still pretty good.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.291
I just don't want people
to panic,

So I'm asking for your help
to keep this thing quiet,

15:28.428 --> 15:31.095

the chillest biohazard lockdown

yeah?

Of course, I understand.

Great, thank you.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.603
See, if you talk to people
like humans,

15:38.605 --> 15:40.271
They'll be reasonable.
I mean, it's just good--

15:40.273 --> 15:41.572
Oh, why is he standing
on that chair?

spread evenly,

He wants a whole pie too.

with a question mark.

16:36.129 --> 16:37.428
What does that mean?

It means you don't have emojis
on your phone.

a human rights violation!

16:50.744 --> 16:52.377
You can't keep us here!

16:52.379 --> 16:56.481
I'm 23, I'm a celebrity,
and today, I'm gonna die!

16:56.483 --> 16:58.483
Not one word of that
is true.

16:58.485 --> 17:00.018
Ow!

17:00.020 --> 17:01.719
Ooh, hitchcock's bleeding!

17:01.721 --> 17:03.321
He got hit in the head
with a soda can!

17:03.323 --> 17:04.722
He never saw it coming!

17:04.723 --> 17:07.025
Jake, we have to start
putting people in detention.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.159
We have to quash this.

17:08.161 --> 17:09.460
No, we need them
to calm down.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.662
We need to put on
<i>something's gotta give.</i>

17:11.664 --> 17:13.564
Great idea.
Great movie.

17:13.566 --> 17:16.467
Also, we should probably
put out that fire.

17:16.469 --> 17:17.801
[alarm beeping]

17:23.776 --> 17:27.244
So, captain,
I have some news.

17:27.247 --> 17:31.049
Well, remember when you told me
not to burn down the precinct?

17:31.051 --> 17:32.583
You burned down
the precinct?

17:32.585 --> 17:34.819
No,
I had the fire put out

17:34.821 --> 17:36.154
Almost immediately.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.289
This is a success story.

17:38.291 --> 17:41.325
<i>[sighs]</i>
<i>well, it started with boyle</i>

17:41.327 --> 17:45.096
<i>Oh, no.</i>
And it ended with a small riot,

17:45.098 --> 17:48.066
In which a dirtbag set
hitchcock's nap couch on fire.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.200
Enough!

17:49.202 --> 17:51.502
Jeffords and I will come
right away.

17:51.504 --> 17:55.239
I'm very disappointed
in you.

17:55.241 --> 17:56.340
[whispering]
what's he saying?

17:56.342 --> 17:58.109
He said he's very disappointed
in you.

17:58.111 --> 18:00.178
Oh, man!

18:01.814 --> 18:03.214
You wanted to see me?

18:03.216 --> 18:04.282
Yeah.

18:04.284 --> 18:05.650
I know you're too proud

18:05.652 --> 18:08.152
To say "I told you so,"
so I'm just gonna--

18:08.154 --> 18:09.187
Told you so.
Not too proud.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.154
That seems right.

18:10.156 --> 18:11.656
Look, I screwed up,

18:11.658 --> 18:13.825
And I think you should take over
command of the precinct.

18:13.827 --> 18:15.159
Been waiting to hear you
say that all day.

18:15.161 --> 18:18.196
Which is why
you shouldn't say it.
What?

18:18.198 --> 18:20.465
You're still trying
to make people happy.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.433
Don't apologize to me.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.635
Be a leader and tell me
what you need me to do.

18:24.637 --> 18:28.272
Tell everyone
what you need them to do.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.707
You're the captain, jake.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.609
I'm the captain now.

18:32.678 --> 18:34.512
<i>Captain phillips.</i>
<i>Captain phillips!</i>

18:34.514 --> 18:35.613
That's what it was.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.614
"look at me, look at me."

18:36.616 --> 18:38.349
Right?
Yeah.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.284
All right, guys, listen up.
All right, listen up, people.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.552
Boyle, you're no longer
my number two.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.554
[sighs]
what did you say to him, amy?

18:43.556 --> 18:45.356
You've been after my job
this whole time.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.291
It's not amy.
I don't need a tinker bell.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.193
I need you to find out
where that powder came from.

18:49.195 --> 18:51.129
Scully, I need you
to help boyle.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.164
Don't worry about hitchcock.
He'll be fine.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.899
I once saw him fall down
three flights of stairs, get up,

18:54.901 --> 18:56.901
And keep eating his hot dog,
like nothing happened.

18:56.903 --> 18:59.137
You're right.
He's the strongest man we know.

18:59.139 --> 19:00.571
No.
Gina, I know you're scared,

19:00.573 --> 19:03.174
But you got to stop
freaking out the civilians.

19:03.176 --> 19:07.445
And, diaz, you need to stop
making fun of gina and help her.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.480
Fine.
All right, everyone, listen up!

19:09.482 --> 19:11.349
<i>I know this is tough to hear,</i>
<i>but we still don't know</i>

19:11.351 --> 19:13.751
What the powder is, and we may
be here for a while yet.

19:13.753 --> 19:16.287
Also, the copy room is now
a detention center

19:16.289 --> 19:17.855
For anyone who gets out of line.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.458
This is a police station in
a lockdown, not a summer camp.

19:20.460 --> 19:21.859
[whispering] ooh,
should we play capture the flag?

19:21.861 --> 19:23.394
Jake!
Right.

19:23.396 --> 19:26.898
Stay tuned for more details.
That'll be all for now.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.566
I'm just gonna go downstairs
and thank your family

19:28.568 --> 19:30.635
For accommodating us.

19:33.372 --> 19:35.239
You will do nothing
of the sort.

19:35.241 --> 19:37.842
Zeke is being nice to me
for the first time ever

19:37.844 --> 19:39.877
Because he thinks you're a jerk
just like his boss.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.947
When we go downstairs,
I want you to scream at me.

19:42.949 --> 19:46.484
I want you to really degrade me
in front of my family.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.252
And this will make you happy?

19:48.254 --> 19:50.488
It's the best thanksgiving gift
you could give me.

19:50.490 --> 19:55.326
What an idiotic thing to say.
What's a thanksgiving gift?

19:56.828 --> 19:59.197
I'm just getting in the zone.

19:59.199 --> 20:00.898
I love it!

20:00.900 --> 20:03.601
Also, I said you ate
all that pie.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.937
Can you put some
around your mouth?

20:05.939 --> 20:08.773
Fine.
Crumb me up.

20:10.542 --> 20:13.277
I have news, everyone.

20:14.413 --> 20:15.846
The powder was not harmful.

20:15.848 --> 20:18.482
[cheers and applause]

20:18.484 --> 20:21.552
Scully!
[laughs]

20:21.554 --> 20:23.287
Aw, I gotta say,
that's pretty sweet.

20:23.289 --> 20:26.524
Oh, the door closed behind him.
Now they're both locked outside.

20:26.526 --> 20:29.293
<i>(jake)</i>
<i>lockdown's officially over.</i>

20:29.295 --> 20:30.895
Squad's heading home
for thanksgiving.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.898
Last I heard,
the precinct was on fire,

20:33.900 --> 20:36.567
And we wouldn't get lab results
for another three hours.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.869
Boyle sped things up.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.972
I noticed an I.T. Guy
we fired two years ago

20:40.974 --> 20:44.709
Turns out he was also fired
from the other precincts.

20:44.711 --> 20:46.510
E.S.U. Raided his home
and found

20:46.512 --> 20:51.449
<i>Bacillus streptomoo-cocomo--</i>
I can't pronounce it.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.985
Regardless, he confessed,
and it wasn't poisonous.

20:53.987 --> 20:56.387
All right, it seems like
you turned it around.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.422
Yeah, actually, we're trying
to clean up here, captain,

20:58.424 --> 21:00.324
So unless you have something
meaningful to contribute,

21:00.326 --> 21:01.759
You can get the hell out.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.628
Oh, right, sorry,
you weren't here

21:03.630 --> 21:05.496
When I switched up
my management style.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.365
That must be so confusing
for you.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.900
Anyways, everyone head on home!
Happy thanksgiving, guys!

21:09.902 --> 21:11.802
Jake.
Happy turkey day, guys.

21:11.804 --> 21:12.970
I'll be in my office.

21:14.906 --> 21:16.974
<i>Not a doctor.</i>
Shh.
