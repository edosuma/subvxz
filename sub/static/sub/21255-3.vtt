to the real me, my music.

00:06.433 --> 00:08.533

- Val, how'd you been?

00:08.633 --> 00:10.433
- If you're asking if I've
recovered from you

00:10.533 --> 00:11.967
breaking up my band,
the answer is no.

00:12.067 --> 00:14.233
- What do you say
we hit the bar down the street,

00:14.333 --> 00:15.233
get a couple drinks?

00:15.333 --> 00:16.233
- Another time maybe.

00:16.333 --> 00:17.733
- My-tre-ita.

00:17.833 --> 00:20.500
- An upside down pineapple
is a sign of a swinger.

00:21.867 --> 00:23.467
- Yes,
I'm the champion of boats!

00:23.567 --> 00:24.633
- You took your hand off.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.500
- No, I'm the winner!

00:26.600 --> 00:28.433
- PMS:
paranormal men's society.

00:28.533 --> 00:29.867
We're kicking you out, Walt.
- Why?

00:29.967 --> 00:31.633
- You're making us
all look crazy.

Oh.

01:40.067 --> 01:42.167
Hey!

01:42.267 --> 01:43.700
Damn it!

01:47.533 --> 01:48.833
I've had a close encounter.

02:15.767 --> 02:16.933
- Wait for it.

02:17.067 --> 02:18.633
Wait for it.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.300
- RONNIE AND VERN: [cheering]

02:22.400 --> 02:23.767
- This is so stupid.

02:23.867 --> 02:25.500
- Stupid?

02:25.600 --> 02:27.867
You know the hours we put in
to become skilled whips men?

02:27.967 --> 02:29.133
- We?

02:29.233 --> 02:31.067
Ronnie, you couldn't even whip
the side of a barn?

02:31.133 --> 02:33.367
- Oooh. Ooh.

02:33.467 --> 02:35.967
Oooh, challenge accepted.

- [laughing]

02:47.067 --> 02:49.067
- What now?

02:49.100 --> 02:51.300
Hey, hey, what's going on?

02:51.400 --> 02:52.733
- She made me do it.

02:52.833 --> 02:54.067
- I merely suggested, okay?
Big difference.

02:54.100 --> 02:56.333
- I told him it was a bad idea
from the start.

02:56.433 --> 02:57.667
- Then why are you doing it?

02:57.767 --> 02:59.500
- Wasn't gonna let
son of a bitch out-whip me.

02:59.600 --> 03:00.800
- [whip snaps]
- [screams]

03:00.900 --> 03:02.833
- Guys, guys,
maybe it's time you two started

03:02.933 --> 03:04.200
thinking about
getting back to work.

03:04.300 --> 03:06.900
- I got lots of song ideas
floating around the cabeza, hey.

03:07.067 --> 03:09.533
- Hey, I could relaunch
"Onboard with Ronnie."

03:09.633 --> 03:12.133
- Ronnie, I'm talking about
a real job that pays real money.

03:12.233 --> 03:13.300
- Real job?

03:13.400 --> 03:14.767
- You know, I don't like
cling startch,

03:14.867 --> 03:17.733
but my God,
this is getting ridiculous.

03:17.833 --> 03:19.733
Which is why both of you
potential fathers

03:19.833 --> 03:21.900
need to start contributing
to the household.

03:22.067 --> 03:23.767
- If that's what it takes
to prove my devotion,

03:23.867 --> 03:25.100
I'll do it.
- You know, Ronnie,

03:25.200 --> 03:27.100
with your whip fishing skills,
you can maybe go pro.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.467
- Oh, you think?

03:28.567 --> 03:30.433
- Charlotte, it might help
if you didn't egg him on.

03:30.533 --> 03:31.867
- Guess we'll never know.

03:33.267 --> 03:35.333
- [phone beeps]

03:35.433 --> 03:37.233
- Anything, I hit that
thing pretty damn square.

03:37.333 --> 03:39.067
- [laughs] You hit it solid,
too, man.

03:39.100 --> 03:40.400
- [phone beeps]

03:40.500 --> 03:41.900
- Damn it.

03:42.067 --> 03:45.167
- What's wrong?
- Hold on, I gotta call Mabel.

03:45.267 --> 03:46.867
- *

03:46.967 --> 03:48.967
- I feel like I've broken
that lamp before.

03:49.067 --> 03:52.500
- *

03:52.600 --> 03:54.300
- Still haven't heard
that guitar strum.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.300
- I know, you're
right about that.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.767
I'm getting ready to.

03:57.867 --> 04:00.667
It's just, uh--I've been working
on trying to be a better man.

04:00.767 --> 04:02.433
I'm trying to do
the right thing by you.

04:02.533 --> 04:04.433
- Why don't you play here,
dumbass?

04:04.533 --> 04:06.267
- Don't you think
that's a little beneath me?

04:06.367 --> 04:08.600
- Vern, it's important you
just gotta get back out there.

04:08.700 --> 04:11.267
Hey, Kaitlynn, you wanna give
a former platinum-selling artist

04:11.367 --> 04:13.300
a gig here?
- No, thank you.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.067
- Let me talk to her.

04:17.400 --> 04:18.667
- [sighs]

04:18.767 --> 04:20.600
- My boy, my boy.
- Say, Big E.

04:20.700 --> 04:22.567
- The good book says,

04:22.667 --> 04:26.467
"If any man provide not for
those of his own house,

04:26.567 --> 04:28.433
he has to night own faith."

04:28.533 --> 04:30.333
- The woman-th say-th
she doesn't want me

04:30.433 --> 04:32.433
to have-th thy gig."

04:32.533 --> 04:34.333
- When have you ever
taken no for answer, son?

04:34.433 --> 04:36.167
By the way...

04:40.067 --> 04:41.867
You need to cut back
on your day drinking.

04:41.967 --> 04:45.767
- *

04:49.900 --> 04:51.333
- Hey, Kait.

04:51.433 --> 04:53.100
Hang on a second.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.500
What if me and my band could
pack this place out

04:55.600 --> 04:57.533
one night a week,
and we split the door?

04:57.633 --> 04:59.267
- Probably get
some folks in here.

04:59.367 --> 05:01.300
He used to be pretty good.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.067
- Fine.

05:03.133 --> 05:04.500
I'll give you Tuesdays.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.200
- Perfect. What's today?

05:06.300 --> 05:07.233
- Tuesday.

05:07.333 --> 05:08.400
Is that a problem?

05:08.500 --> 05:10.133
- No, I don't have no problem.

05:11.433 --> 05:13.400
Thanks for vouching for me.
I owe you.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.067
- No, you don't owe me.

05:15.100 --> 05:16.533
- About this band.

05:16.633 --> 05:17.733
- What about it?

05:17.833 --> 05:19.500
- Technically,
I don't have one.

05:19.600 --> 05:20.867
- [whispers] Vernon.

05:20.967 --> 05:22.367
- Hey, Big Mike!

05:22.467 --> 05:24.067
Vernon Brown here.

05:24.167 --> 05:27.433
Get the band together tonight
for a gig here in Nashville.

05:27.533 --> 05:28.967
Of course you were
the first guy I called.

05:29.067 --> 05:30.533
Thought maybe--
- [dial tone sounds]

05:30.633 --> 05:32.233
- Hello? Hello?

05:32.333 --> 05:34.433
Yo, Travis, how 'bout you,
big dog?

05:34.533 --> 05:35.867
Do what?

05:35.967 --> 05:39.600
Uh, I'm pretty sure that's
anatomically impossible.

05:39.700 --> 05:42.100
Hey, Pete, Vernon Brown here.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.400
I did not!

05:43.500 --> 05:47.300
Riggs, you four-fingered
son of a bitch, how you been?

05:47.400 --> 05:49.667
Oh, sorry to hear that.

05:49.767 --> 05:51.600
She was a great lady.

05:51.700 --> 05:53.967
Yep, well, listen,
enough small talk, hey,

05:54.067 --> 05:55.433
we're getting the band
back together tonight

05:55.533 --> 05:56.867
for a gig in Nashville.

05:56.967 --> 05:59.400
And of course you were
the first one I called.

05:59.500 --> 06:00.567
You're in?

06:00.667 --> 06:02.567
Alright, great!

06:02.667 --> 06:05.433
Yeah, eight o'clock.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.200
We'll be here.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.533
Alright.

06:08.633 --> 06:11.667
- ALL: [cheering]
- Good ol' Riggs, man.

06:11.767 --> 06:14.933
One down and...three to go.

06:19.133 --> 06:21.067
- She says she wants me
to start paying rent.

06:21.100 --> 06:23.800
I mean, we've been living
together for like six years.

06:23.900 --> 06:26.300
Certainly that makes me
a common law owner or something.

06:26.400 --> 06:30.100
- All I asked is if you had
any mailroom experience.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.700
- What is up
with this tiny coach?

06:32.800 --> 06:35.700
[groans] Cramp in my hammies.

06:35.800 --> 06:39.567
- Okay, well, um,
thanks for coming in, Ronnie.

06:39.667 --> 06:43.600
I guess we'll call you
if you, um--

06:43.700 --> 06:46.900
- Well, well, well,
who do we have here?

06:47.067 --> 06:48.300
- Sorry, Mr. Fischer.

06:48.400 --> 06:51.200
Um, Ronnie here came in about
the mailroom position,

06:51.300 --> 06:54.533
but he's not a good fit.

06:54.633 --> 06:57.467
- Well, he looks
pretty fit to me.

06:57.567 --> 06:58.867
[laughs]

06:58.967 --> 07:04.533
Have you had any experience
handling mail, Ronnie?

07:04.633 --> 07:05.933
Either spelling.

07:06.067 --> 07:07.967
- Yeah, I've been handling mail
my whole life.

07:08.067 --> 07:09.800
Gotten some mail,
opened most of it,

07:09.900 --> 07:11.067
sent some of it back.

07:11.100 --> 07:13.067
- Of course you have.

07:13.133 --> 07:18.067
You know, Ronnie,
I can see myself in you.

07:18.100 --> 07:20.600
- Oh, sir--
- Sssh.

07:20.700 --> 07:23.267
Welcome to Coy Stable, Ronnie.

07:23.367 --> 07:24.500
Saddle 'em up!

07:24.600 --> 07:27.567
Hee-ay!

07:27.667 --> 07:30.167
- I got a job?

07:30.267 --> 07:31.800
- Is this it?

07:31.900 --> 07:33.833
- Come on.

07:35.867 --> 07:38.467
- [knocking at door]
- [siren wailing]

07:44.333 --> 07:46.533
- You cops?

07:46.633 --> 07:48.133
- No.

07:48.233 --> 07:49.367
- Damn.

07:49.467 --> 07:52.700
Someone stole my roller blades
of my van, so--

07:52.800 --> 07:55.500
Whatever. Come in.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.067
- Should we go?
No, we gotta go.

07:57.100 --> 07:59.867
We gotta go.
- No, come on in.

08:00.067 --> 08:02.833
Alright, welcome
to the Palace De Mark.

08:02.933 --> 08:05.867
We got Che-Che over here
chilling with that snake.

08:05.967 --> 08:07.233
Say hello.

08:07.333 --> 08:09.067
We got Tugboat
hanging out on the couch

08:09.100 --> 08:10.200
next to Old-Ass Helen.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.200
What's up?
- [monkey screeching]

08:12.300 --> 08:14.067
- Okay, if you're here
about those ferrets,

08:14.100 --> 08:16.333
sorry about that,
but they're already spoken for.

08:16.433 --> 08:18.567
- No thanks.

08:18.667 --> 08:20.233
Is that a monkey?

08:20.333 --> 08:21.667
- What? A monk--

08:21.767 --> 08:22.933
- [monkey screeching]

08:23.067 --> 08:24.167
- Dang, you might be right.

08:24.267 --> 08:26.367
Tugboat, you been lying to me?

08:26.467 --> 08:29.167
Tugboat, you know you shouldn't
knock that down.

08:29.267 --> 08:31.333
Tugboat.
- [monkey screeching]

08:31.433 --> 08:32.500
- Sorry about that.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.800
- Is that your grandmother?
- Grandmother?

08:34.900 --> 08:36.400
No, Helen's a client, yo.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.767
I run a hospice on the side.
What's up?

08:38.867 --> 08:40.200
Sorry, adult daycare.

08:40.300 --> 08:41.367
[laughs]

08:41.467 --> 08:43.967
Hey, your parents,
grandparents, whatever.

08:44.067 --> 08:45.933
- We need IDs.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.333
- Alright, okay, come this way.

08:47.433 --> 08:51.200
We're talking about green cards,
passports,

08:51.300 --> 08:53.767
Latin American
extended stay visas?

08:53.867 --> 08:56.067
- Um, no, no, none of that.

08:56.100 --> 08:58.833
Uh, we just need normal IDs
that say we're 21

08:58.933 --> 09:00.867
within the next two hours.

09:00.967 --> 09:02.200
- Got it.

09:02.300 --> 09:03.867
And you're willing to do
whatever it takes

09:03.967 --> 09:06.067
to get these IDs, huh?

09:07.667 --> 09:09.233
- We have 20 bucks.

09:09.333 --> 09:12.733
- *

09:12.833 --> 09:14.400
- That'll do.
Yeah, okay, 20 bucks.

09:14.500 --> 09:15.967
Alright, let me see
what we got here.

09:16.067 --> 09:18.467
We got Ohio, no thanks.

09:18.567 --> 09:19.800
Georgia.

09:19.900 --> 09:22.100
Hawaii. No, too exotic.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.733
You look like Montana.

09:24.833 --> 09:26.967
Here we go. Okay.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.800
- Uh, there's nothing on this.

09:29.900 --> 09:32.500
- Yeah, I put in Photoshop.
[laughs]

09:32.600 --> 09:34.600
- Couldn't you just add
the photo in Photoshop?

09:34.700 --> 09:39.267
- Add the photo in Photosh--

09:39.367 --> 09:42.867
Oh, wow! Yes!

09:42.967 --> 09:44.133
Yes, I can do that!

09:44.233 --> 09:45.733
I can definitely do that.

09:45.833 --> 09:47.100
You get a discount.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.800
That's a timesaver.
What's up?

09:49.900 --> 09:52.700
Alright, smile.
Not like real smile.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.433
Smile like you hate your job.

09:54.533 --> 09:55.833
There you go.

09:55.933 --> 09:58.267
- Alright, now keep your eye
out for a goofy looking fella

09:58.367 --> 10:02.500
about yeah tall,
probably dressed kinda weird.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.867
- Oh, that's gotta be him.

10:04.967 --> 10:06.900
- Hey, Charlotte's dad.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.133
- Oh my God, man,
I ain't seen pants that tight

10:10.233 --> 10:12.333
since Aunt Dolly ripped
the ass-end out of her drawers

10:12.433 --> 10:13.967
stepping up to get on
the holy roller

10:14.067 --> 10:15.300
at the county fair.

10:15.400 --> 10:17.333
- What can I do?
I'm a slave to fashion.

10:17.433 --> 10:19.167
- Anyway, listen, I'm in need
of a keyboard player.

10:19.267 --> 10:20.533
And Charlotte said
you may know one.

10:20.633 --> 10:21.500
- I'm in.

10:21.600 --> 10:22.667
I'm totally in.

10:22.767 --> 10:23.700
- Well, the gig's tonight.

10:23.800 --> 10:25.200
- Okay, okay.

10:25.300 --> 10:28.700
Um, hey, Chet, I'm going
to need to tender my resignation

10:28.800 --> 10:30.100
effective immediately.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.900
And I hope this doesn't
affect our friendship.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.300
- Are you sure about this, man?

10:34.400 --> 10:36.200
- Hey, hold on, Haus,
it's just a one-off gig,

10:36.300 --> 10:38.400
kind of a trial run,
so don't push your--

10:38.500 --> 10:39.967
- Oh, okay.

10:40.067 --> 10:41.633
Hey, Chet, listen.

10:41.733 --> 10:45.333
About that resignation, um, I'm
going to need to rescind that

10:45.433 --> 10:48.000
and maybe get you to cover
my shift tonight instead?

10:48.100 --> 10:49.900
- Dude, you're the manager.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.967
You can do whatever the hell
you want.

10:52.067 --> 10:56.533
- [laughing]
I'll get my stuff.

10:56.633 --> 10:58.200
- [bell rings]

10:58.300 --> 11:02.233
- *

11:10.700 --> 11:13.367
- VERN: Okay, I guess we'll
see you later then, Walt.

11:13.467 --> 11:15.400
Anyway, man,
we got about two hours

11:15.500 --> 11:17.067
to get this band together, okay?
- Okay.

11:17.100 --> 11:18.400
- I got you on the keys.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.600
Got the finest guitar player
in all of Tennessee.

11:20.700 --> 11:22.067
- Awesome.

11:22.133 --> 11:24.300
- All I need to do is
find my old drummer Mo Moony.

11:24.400 --> 11:25.467
- Mo Moony?
- Mo Moony.

11:25.567 --> 11:27.233
It ain't gonna be easy
to find him either.

11:27.333 --> 11:28.900
Last I heard, he was dating
this little gal--

11:29.067 --> 11:31.067
- Found him! Let's ride!

11:31.100 --> 11:33.633
- Are you [bleep] me?

11:33.733 --> 11:37.200
- [church bell tolls]

11:37.300 --> 11:38.800
- So what do you think?

11:38.900 --> 11:40.200
- Real nice work, Mo.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.767
- Yeah,
my headstone carving business

11:42.867 --> 11:44.267
has really taken off.

11:44.367 --> 11:47.067
But I'm happy to gig with
you guys nights and weekends.

11:47.100 --> 11:48.767
- Sounds like
we're in business.

11:48.867 --> 11:50.200
Now all we need's a bass player.

11:50.300 --> 11:51.733
You happen to know
where Rick is?

11:51.833 --> 11:52.967
He was always a standup guy.

11:53.067 --> 11:54.867
- Rick? Yeah.

11:54.967 --> 11:56.533
Rick's dead.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.100
- *

11:59.200 --> 12:02.833
- Well,
got a real nice tombstone.

12:02.933 --> 12:05.100
- I got a bass player
we can use.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.600
Follow me.

12:06.700 --> 12:08.767
- *

12:08.867 --> 12:10.067
- Come on, guys.

12:10.100 --> 12:15.133
- *

12:22.067 --> 12:23.067
- She'll do.

12:23.133 --> 12:25.267
- You don't wanna
hear her play?

12:25.367 --> 12:27.067
- [guitar tunes]
- Unnecessary.

12:27.100 --> 12:28.233
- We're good.
- Yeah.

12:31.733 --> 12:35.733
- *

12:36.867 --> 12:39.467
- [phone ringing]

12:39.567 --> 12:41.500
- Welcome
to Universal Security.

12:41.600 --> 12:43.900
What can I help you with?
Deposit?

12:44.067 --> 12:45.267
- Nice try.

12:45.367 --> 12:47.233
Like I'd put my money
in a corrupt banking system

12:47.333 --> 12:49.333
founded in secret by politicians
and Wall Street thieves

12:49.433 --> 12:51.333
to perpetuate
their self-serving interests.

12:51.433 --> 12:52.867
- You mean the Federal Reserve?

12:52.967 --> 12:53.967
- Exactly.

12:54.067 --> 12:55.533
Nether federal nor a reserve.

12:55.633 --> 12:57.633
- Well, is there something else
I can help you with?

12:57.733 --> 12:58.500
- Yeah.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.267
What can you tell me about this?

13:00.367 --> 13:02.333
- LEIA: Where did you get that?

13:07.967 --> 13:09.833
- This is yours?
- Yeah.

13:09.933 --> 13:12.067
- Was that you last night?

13:12.100 --> 13:13.333
Why did you run?

13:13.433 --> 13:14.800
- Why were you wearing
a welding mask?

13:14.900 --> 13:17.133
- Because of the protective
qualities of variable density

13:17.233 --> 13:18.333
polarized glass.

13:18.433 --> 13:20.300
- Oh, of course.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.233
Crop circles are known to emit
high levels of--

13:22.333 --> 13:23.933
- BOTH: --electromagnetic
radiation.

13:24.067 --> 13:25.267
- *

13:25.367 --> 13:28.300
- Exactly.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.600
Maybe you and I
should get coffee and talk.

13:31.700 --> 13:32.867
- I'd like that.

13:36.933 --> 13:40.233
So I found your equations
intriguing, so I...

13:40.333 --> 13:41.767
filled 'em in for you,
because you had left

13:41.867 --> 13:44.500
before finishing
your measurements here.

13:44.600 --> 13:45.967
- Thanks.

13:46.067 --> 13:48.133
This is the eighth crop circle
to appear in the area

13:48.233 --> 13:50.067
in the last three years.

13:50.100 --> 13:51.500
- I'm fairly new
to crop circles.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.367
- I'm trying to figure out
the pattern.

13:53.467 --> 13:56.333
Well, listen, I really wanna
finish this conversation.

13:56.433 --> 13:57.633
But my break's almost over.

13:57.733 --> 13:58.833
- Yeah.

13:58.933 --> 14:03.533
Uh, well, uh...later tonight,
if you're free,

14:03.633 --> 14:06.100
some of my friends
are playing at Betty's.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.100
It should be interesting.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.100
- That sounds fun.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.400
I'll try and make it.

14:10.500 --> 14:12.533
- [clears throat]

14:12.633 --> 14:16.133
Leia, you're not supposed
to leave your window

14:16.233 --> 14:18.600
without flipping
your closed sign.

14:18.700 --> 14:20.800
- Can you just flip it, Terry?

14:20.900 --> 14:23.067
I'm trying to have
a conversation here.

14:23.100 --> 14:26.467
- *

14:26.567 --> 14:27.967
- Protocol states that

14:28.067 --> 14:30.933
you flip your own sign
when you leave your window.

14:32.367 --> 14:34.533
- Uh.

14:34.633 --> 14:37.200
Sure.

14:37.300 --> 14:38.700
A little reading material.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.700
You could probably
get back on that deal.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.800
- Well, well, well,
look who it is.

14:51.900 --> 14:54.267
- Vance, what a surprise.

14:54.367 --> 14:55.800
- Vance.

14:55.900 --> 14:56.967
- Morning, Coy.

14:57.067 --> 14:59.233
- Ronnie.
- Good morning, Coy.

14:59.333 --> 15:00.900
- [bell rings]
- How dare you call that

15:01.067 --> 15:02.433
titan of industry
by his Christian name?

15:02.533 --> 15:04.367
- Coy? He hired me.

15:04.467 --> 15:07.900
He says I show great promise
and have a strong torso.

15:08.067 --> 15:12.167
- Look, why don't you do
what you were hired to do...

15:12.267 --> 15:14.367
and clean up after me.

15:16.267 --> 15:17.500
Whoops.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.067
Is that a--
- Oh God!

15:20.167 --> 15:22.833
Shut up! Look at what you
made me do, you moron.

15:26.167 --> 15:28.533
I'll be at the genuis club.
Somebody watch my phone!

15:28.633 --> 15:29.700
- MAN: Pick up that phone!

15:29.800 --> 15:31.633
- VANCE: Does anybody have
a bag of rice?

15:31.733 --> 15:33.367
- MAN: Hey, get that.
- [phone ringing]

15:33.467 --> 15:36.067
- [grunting]

15:36.167 --> 15:37.433
Yello?

15:37.533 --> 15:41.700
Yes, I can help you
with your investments.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.100
Yes.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.167
Yes, we take checks.

15:45.267 --> 15:46.833
- You think he'll make it?

15:46.933 --> 15:48.167
- Oh, he'll be here.

15:48.267 --> 15:50.067
We got a history together.

15:50.133 --> 15:52.133
Remember that night
in Arkansas with Riggs, Mo?

15:52.233 --> 15:53.567
- Yeah. The night

15:53.667 --> 15:55.467
you slept with his girl
and wrecked his car?

15:55.567 --> 15:57.667
- I still can't believe
he ever forgave me.

15:57.767 --> 16:00.900
- I'm just spit-balling, Vern,
but do you think maybe

16:01.067 --> 16:03.833
him not showing up is his way
of getting back at you?

16:03.933 --> 16:08.233
- That would explain
these cryptic text messages.

16:08.333 --> 16:11.400
- "Payback is a bitch."

16:11.500 --> 16:14.900
Then you wrote, "Sure is.
See you soon."

16:15.067 --> 16:16.167
- Dios mio.

16:16.267 --> 16:17.600
So much for a guitar player.

16:17.700 --> 16:18.933
What do we do know?

16:19.067 --> 16:21.200
- The changes of us finding
a decent guitar player

16:21.300 --> 16:23.600
in the next ten minutes
that I haven't screwed over

16:23.700 --> 16:25.333
in some form, shape, or fashion,

16:25.433 --> 16:26.767
it just ain't gonna happen.

16:26.867 --> 16:28.300
Walt, could you hold it down
over there?

16:28.400 --> 16:30.167
I'm trying to think.

16:30.267 --> 16:33.433
- *

16:33.533 --> 16:34.600
- What?

16:37.500 --> 16:39.833
- *

16:39.933 --> 16:41.333
- Boss, you wanted to see me?

16:41.433 --> 16:43.600
- Hey, come in
and lock the door.

16:43.700 --> 16:44.900
I'm joking, of course.

16:45.067 --> 16:46.767
There's no lock on the door.

16:46.867 --> 16:49.400
It swings both ways.
- Oh.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.333
- Sit down.
- Cool.

16:51.433 --> 16:55.900
- So the scuttlebutt is that
you answered a phone call today,

16:56.067 --> 16:58.233
and you landed a big fish.

16:58.333 --> 17:03.500
- Uh, yeah, that, um--I was
kinda caught off guard

17:03.600 --> 17:06.300
with that, so I kinda promised
that guy that if he invested

17:06.400 --> 17:07.867
one of our funds that we could

17:07.967 --> 17:09.400
double his money
in three months.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.267
I figured we could take
the money from other investors

17:11.367 --> 17:13.433
to pay him,
and then he'll tell his friends,

17:13.533 --> 17:14.867
and then they'll invest.

17:14.967 --> 17:16.867
Then no one will really know
where the money comes from.

17:16.967 --> 17:18.667
- Mm.
- Is that bad?

17:18.767 --> 17:21.433
- Normally, I'd say yes.

17:21.533 --> 17:24.900
But Coy loves a man
with initiative.

17:25.067 --> 17:28.300
You know, Ronnie, with my help,
you might just have

17:28.400 --> 17:31.600
what it takes to make it...

17:31.700 --> 17:34.767
in this business.

17:34.867 --> 17:37.133
Wanna make it with me, Ronnie?

17:40.533 --> 17:42.133
- What's it pay?

17:42.233 --> 17:45.233
- *

17:45.333 --> 17:47.133
- Oh yeah!

17:47.233 --> 17:48.267
Come on!

17:48.367 --> 17:50.600
- *

17:50.700 --> 17:54.633
* Bellbottoms
were really cool *

17:54.733 --> 17:58.767
* Cutting class
and skipping school *

17:58.867 --> 18:03.067
* I remember packing
that ol' fishing pole *

18:03.167 --> 18:07.267
* Skinny-dipping
at a swimming hole *

18:07.367 --> 18:11.667
* Back lights, red lights
and strobe lights too *

18:11.767 --> 18:16.133
* Were all the rage
for me and you *

18:16.233 --> 18:20.533
* Only one thing
I miss more than that *

18:20.633 --> 18:24.867
* I want my mullet back

18:24.967 --> 18:28.833
* I want my mullet back

18:28.933 --> 18:33.233
* My old Camaro,
and my eight-track *

18:33.333 --> 18:37.600
* Fuzzy dice hanging
loose and proud *

18:37.700 --> 18:41.700
* ZZ Top,
they're playing loud *

18:41.800 --> 18:45.867
* A simple time,
that's what I miss *

18:45.967 --> 18:50.733
* Your miniskirt
and your sweet kiss *

18:50.833 --> 18:54.733
* Things are changing,
man, and that's a fact *

18:54.833 --> 18:58.400
* I want my mullet back

18:58.500 --> 19:00.300
**

19:00.400 --> 19:03.533
- [crowd cheering]

19:03.633 --> 19:05.467
- That was fun.
- That was fun.

19:05.567 --> 19:07.433
- Two hundred bucks.

19:07.533 --> 19:08.633
- Thank you very much.

19:08.733 --> 19:10.967
Not bad, not bad.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.067
- Then half of the bar.

19:13.100 --> 19:15.500
Thirty bucks
for wait-staff and kitchen,

19:15.600 --> 19:18.733
leaves a total of 70 bucks.

19:18.833 --> 19:22.867
Minus that $65 bar tab
you rung up.

19:22.967 --> 19:26.633
Leaves a total of...five bucks.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.467
- Alright!
Look at that!

19:28.567 --> 19:30.533
Vernon Brown getting paid!

19:30.633 --> 19:32.167
I told you'd be back on top.

19:32.267 --> 19:33.700
Told you.

19:33.800 --> 19:34.800
- Gracias.

19:34.900 --> 19:37.300
- Wow, thanks.

19:37.400 --> 19:39.300
- Federal coupon.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.700
- Thatta boy, good job.

19:41.800 --> 19:44.800
- A working man.

19:44.900 --> 19:46.867
- Slightly above rock bottom,
I guess.

19:46.967 --> 19:49.433
- Hey, Leia.
- Hey.

19:49.533 --> 19:51.300
- Reggie.
- Great show.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.567
- Thanks.

19:52.667 --> 19:53.800
I didn't know
you knew each other.

19:53.900 --> 19:55.833
- Yeah, this is my girl.

19:55.933 --> 19:58.800
We do things...together.

19:58.900 --> 20:00.633
In private.
- I get it.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.267
- I don't take my hat off,
though.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.567
I don't like to do that.
- WALT: Okay.

20:04.667 --> 20:07.533
I guess that means
you're in PMS?

20:07.633 --> 20:10.500
- Yes, someone insists that it's
the paranormal men's society.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.733
- Babe, we've gone over this.
It's in the charter.

20:12.833 --> 20:14.833
It's out of my hands, okay?

20:14.933 --> 20:16.633
It's a men's society.

20:16.733 --> 20:20.100
- I, actually,
have a group of my own.

20:20.200 --> 20:23.633
And we are currently accepting
members of all genders

20:23.733 --> 20:26.700
called Ultra Terrestrial
Investigations.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.300
- UTI?

20:28.400 --> 20:30.800
You can't invite my girlfriend
to join your dumb group.

20:30.900 --> 20:33.567
- Well, he just did.

20:33.667 --> 20:36.100
You just let me know when
the next meeting is, Walt.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.600
- I will.

20:37.700 --> 20:39.000
Probably pretty soon.

20:39.100 --> 20:42.133
- You watch yourself,
'cause I'm watching you.

20:42.233 --> 20:44.600
- So you're gonna like
be looking at me

20:44.700 --> 20:46.367
while I'm looking in the mirror?

20:46.467 --> 20:49.267
- That hurts my head.
I gotta--I can't right now.

20:54.433 --> 20:57.500
- I'm proud of you, Vern.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.400
That one's on me.

21:02.067 --> 21:03.300
What's that look for?

21:03.400 --> 21:05.667
- Just played a great show
with my new band.

21:05.767 --> 21:08.533
You just gave me a free beer,
and you're proud of me.

21:08.633 --> 21:11.833
Who's rich now?

21:11.933 --> 21:13.600
- I have to say,
you surprised me today.

21:13.700 --> 21:14.700
- What?

21:14.800 --> 21:16.133
With my ripping guitar solos?

21:16.233 --> 21:17.700
- [laughs] Those were good.

21:17.800 --> 21:21.267
But I meant
with your determination.

21:21.367 --> 21:24.633
You know, you really
came through today.

21:24.733 --> 21:26.933
I think you found your start.

21:27.067 --> 21:30.067
The beer's free,
but you still gotta tip.

21:38.367 --> 21:39.933
- That sounds great.
- Great.

21:40.067 --> 21:41.333
See you tomorrow
at our secret meeting.

21:41.433 --> 21:42.633
- Watch yourself.

21:42.733 --> 21:44.933
You are speeding down
the wrong highway, my friend.

21:45.067 --> 21:46.667
- Watching myself speeding--

21:46.767 --> 21:48.367
am I looking at a mirror
in a car?

21:48.467 --> 21:50.567
- Better be looking in a mirror
if you wanna drive safely.

21:50.667 --> 21:53.067
You better check your mirrors,
keep your hands at ten and two.

21:53.167 --> 21:55.100
And keep 'em off my girl.
- I mean, she's probably

21:55.200 --> 21:56.667
a couple of blocks away
at this point.

21:56.767 --> 21:57.967
- Do you wanna go play pool,

21:58.067 --> 21:59.400
because I don't know where
she went?

21:59.500 --> 22:00.667
Oh.
- Bye.

22:03.100 --> 22:04.400
- [girl laughs]
