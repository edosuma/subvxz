Previously on
<i>Covert Affairs...</i>

00:02.193 --> 00:03.594
You're one of Billy's
college buddies, right?

00:03.628 --> 00:04.895
I'm Parker.

00:04.929 --> 00:06.232
Billy's little sister.

00:06.267 --> 00:07.471
I'm leaving the next
this fall though.

00:07.506 --> 00:08.833
Off to the Peace Corps.

00:08.867 --> 00:10.550
You don't wanna take a blind
man to the dance floor.

00:10.584 --> 00:12.410
It just took so long
to get over losing Billy,

00:12.444 --> 00:13.542
and this feels like--

00:13.576 --> 00:15.010
No, no, you don't need
to explain it.

00:15.048 --> 00:17.883
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have done that.

00:17.917 --> 00:19.215
That's how they teach you
in the CIA?

00:19.249 --> 00:21.443
Why would CIA and Mossad
share the same safe house?

00:21.478 --> 00:23.207
Food.
You don't want it to get cold.

00:23.242 --> 00:24.907
So many have
trouble improvising,

00:24.941 --> 00:26.603
but you, you have some gears
to shift into.

00:26.637 --> 00:28.468
- Listen, buddy, if you--
- <i>bonsoir.</i>

00:28.503 --> 00:30.768
- This is--
- A pleasant surprise, I hope.

00:32.774 --> 00:34.005
Let's go.

00:34.039 --> 00:35.541
- Maybe the Riviera next time.
- I don't know.

00:35.575 --> 00:37.943
The beaches in Israel
are much better.

01:04.266 --> 01:05.565
I can't talk.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.165
This is Vincent Rossabi,

01:07.200 --> 01:08.767
your friendly
neighborhood "G" man.

01:12.803 --> 01:15.203
Uh, this is not
a good time.

01:15.238 --> 01:17.471
Well, can you give
the FBI five minutes?

01:19.672 --> 01:23.206
Blues yard, you know it?

01:23.241 --> 01:25.574
Yeah, I know it.
I'll be there in 15.

01:25.608 --> 01:27.942
Okay.

01:30.112 --> 01:33.614
I am so sorry.
It's work.

01:33.648 --> 01:35.615
I mean, can I give you
a ride somewhere?

01:35.649 --> 01:38.518
No, they're sending a car.

01:38.553 --> 01:40.788
So rude.
Can we reschedule?

01:40.822 --> 01:43.023
It's okay.

01:43.057 --> 01:45.759
I, uh, I know a ripcord call
when I hear one.

01:45.793 --> 01:47.627
It really is work.

01:47.661 --> 01:49.929
It's okay.

02:04.474 --> 02:06.174
Bluegrass?

02:06.209 --> 02:09.776
Blind date.
I gave it a shot.

02:09.811 --> 02:14.147
I realize the Smithsonian
keeps banker's hours,

02:14.181 --> 02:15.948
but I need a favor.

02:15.982 --> 02:18.149
I think we've run that joke
into the ground, don't you?

02:18.184 --> 02:20.251
Okay.

02:20.285 --> 02:22.319
I've got
a confidential informant

02:22.353 --> 02:24.487
who has been approached
by a CIA operative.

02:24.522 --> 02:25.989
Approached?

02:26.023 --> 02:27.323
Harassed, spooked,
you fill in the blank.

02:27.357 --> 02:29.691
And this informant
figures importantly

02:29.726 --> 02:31.160
in a case that we have spent,

02:31.194 --> 02:34.329
well, that I have spent
a great deal of time on.

02:34.364 --> 02:36.599
You want the Agency
to back off?

02:36.633 --> 02:38.267
Affirmative.

02:38.301 --> 02:40.436
Okay.

02:40.470 --> 02:42.003
Did you run it up the chain?

02:42.038 --> 02:43.204
Yeah, I crossed my Ts,
dotted my Is.

02:43.238 --> 02:44.472
I mean, it was protocol
all the way.

02:44.506 --> 02:45.472
And?

02:45.507 --> 02:47.141
Global deafening silence.

02:47.175 --> 02:49.643
I'm not sure
what you think--

02:49.677 --> 02:52.279
Okay, you know what,
you can take a message for me.

02:52.313 --> 02:54.748
You can tell your operative
he can forget about tonight.

02:54.782 --> 02:56.349
I don't even know
if we have an op,

02:56.384 --> 02:58.285
and I certainly don't know
anything about tonight.

02:58.319 --> 03:01.121
Yeah, well, he was supposed
to meet my asset at Joe's Bar.

03:01.155 --> 03:04.457
He will not be there.

03:04.492 --> 03:05.892
Nothing?

03:05.926 --> 03:09.161
I'm telling you,
there is no Agency interest

03:09.195 --> 03:10.929
in Rossabi's informant.

03:10.963 --> 03:13.231
And you know how I love
coming in late at night

03:13.265 --> 03:14.932
to find nothing.

03:14.966 --> 03:16.967
Oh, don't sell
yourself short, Auggie.

03:17.001 --> 03:19.168
Nobody finds nothing
like you.

03:19.203 --> 03:21.370
Guess I walked
into that one.

03:21.404 --> 03:23.272
Dealer's choice,
I'd say.

03:23.306 --> 03:24.906
Your call, Walker.

03:24.940 --> 03:26.741
Uh, I'm going in.

03:26.775 --> 03:28.443
Why am I not surprised?

03:28.477 --> 03:31.846
How are you gonna know
this impostor?

03:31.880 --> 03:35.216
Rossabi said
he'll be at the last table

03:35.251 --> 03:36.918
on the right.

03:36.952 --> 03:39.954
Happy hunting.
Call me after.

03:47.062 --> 03:49.496
Annie Walker.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.031
Eyal Lavin.

03:54.535 --> 03:57.135
You know, people
have gone to prison

03:57.170 --> 03:59.104
for impersonating
a CIA operative.

03:59.138 --> 04:02.273
Well, then I sure hope
I don't get caught.

Mossad?
I don't know.

05:12.034 --> 05:14.035
Me, I'm just
having a drink.

05:14.069 --> 05:15.737
Will you join me?

05:15.771 --> 05:17.138
You know what I mean.

05:17.172 --> 05:18.706
Having a Sazerac.

05:18.741 --> 05:20.041
I developed a taste for it

05:20.075 --> 05:21.709
when I was in med school
in Tel-Aviv.

05:21.744 --> 05:23.645
- Two more, please.
- No, thank you.

05:23.679 --> 05:25.581
- Med school?
- Are you sure?

05:25.615 --> 05:27.549
It's only good when
it's served extremely cold,

05:27.583 --> 05:28.884
which this establishment
appreciates.

05:28.918 --> 05:30.285
When were you in med school?

05:30.319 --> 05:32.020
Well, that's
a different story.

05:32.054 --> 05:33.421
Are you sure
you don't want one?

05:33.455 --> 05:37.125
Eyal, listen to me.

05:37.159 --> 05:38.994
Always.

05:39.028 --> 05:41.096
You're gonna be drinking
alone tonight.

05:41.131 --> 05:42.631
That's a pity.

05:42.666 --> 05:44.133
The person
you were planning to meet,

05:44.168 --> 05:45.735
you will never
meet with again.

05:45.769 --> 05:48.605
That sounds permanent.

05:48.639 --> 05:50.874
And stop pretending
to be CIA.

05:50.908 --> 05:52.642
That's too bad,

05:52.677 --> 05:54.778
'cause it's refreshingly
uncomplicated.

05:54.812 --> 05:55.946
Oh, here we go.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.681
You see,
remove all logic,

05:57.715 --> 05:59.616
sex, weapons, initiative.

05:59.650 --> 06:01.718
Replace it with
calling your bosses

06:01.752 --> 06:04.187
every hour on the hour,
endless amount of paperwork,

06:04.221 --> 06:06.055
and there you are.

06:06.090 --> 06:08.491
CIA.

06:08.525 --> 06:10.959
Good-lookin'
and funny.

06:10.993 --> 06:12.694
You mind me good-looking?

06:12.729 --> 06:15.530
Eyal, stop.

06:17.166 --> 06:18.967
I'm serious.

06:22.138 --> 06:25.307
Enjoy your drink.

06:25.342 --> 06:27.510
Oh, and fyi,
the perfect Sazerac

06:27.544 --> 06:29.379
is at the best bar
in the city,

06:29.413 --> 06:30.380
the Parchment.

06:30.414 --> 06:33.450
You're wrong, you know?

06:33.484 --> 06:37.120
See, what's, uh--

06:37.155 --> 06:40.323
what's gonna happen is this.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.225
You're gonna report back
to your superiors

06:42.259 --> 06:43.726
that we talked,

06:43.761 --> 06:45.861
and they're gonna want to know
why Mossad is here,

06:45.896 --> 06:48.363
why we're interested
in this individual.

06:48.398 --> 06:50.632
So they will task you,
Annie Walker,

06:50.666 --> 06:53.034
with finding out,

06:53.068 --> 06:55.536
with following me.

06:55.571 --> 06:57.905
You're never boring,

06:57.939 --> 07:00.875
I'll give you that.

07:02.945 --> 07:05.046
Safe trip home.

07:08.551 --> 07:09.584
He's right.

07:09.619 --> 07:11.386
- Excuse me.
- He's right.

07:11.421 --> 07:13.556
We do want to know
what Mossad is doing here.

07:13.590 --> 07:16.058
Rossabi's informant
Jacob Yassen.

07:16.093 --> 07:17.393
He's the son
of a wealthy emir

07:17.427 --> 07:18.895
in the United Arab Emirates.

07:18.929 --> 07:21.030
He lives in the U.S.
and is part owner

07:21.064 --> 07:22.465
of an international
construction firm.

07:22.499 --> 07:25.602
And his firm is involved
in various illicit activities

07:25.636 --> 07:28.906
here in the states
and overseas.

07:28.940 --> 07:31.742
Tom Ford azure lime, Jai?

07:31.777 --> 07:35.246
The prodigal son has returned
to the DPD.

07:35.281 --> 07:38.316
The DCI wants special
projects in on this one.

07:38.351 --> 07:40.485
The Feds have had their hooks
in Jacob for a while.

07:40.519 --> 07:42.354
He turned informant
to avoid prosecution

07:42.388 --> 07:43.989
on a bid-tampering charge.

07:44.023 --> 07:45.290
Hence Agent Rossabi's
concern.

07:45.324 --> 07:47.693
Wouldn't say the mood
at Hoover is concern.

07:47.727 --> 07:48.860
I just got off
the phone with them.

07:48.895 --> 07:50.094
They're upset.

07:50.129 --> 07:52.397
Why is Mossad pursuing this?

07:52.432 --> 07:56.034
A black op on our soil,
no heads-up?

07:56.069 --> 07:58.070
Annie, I want you
to run point on this.

07:58.104 --> 08:00.073
Follow Eyal
and determine why.

08:00.107 --> 08:01.908
I'll back-channel
King Saul Boulevard,

08:01.942 --> 08:03.643
which will no doubt
prove fruitless.

08:03.677 --> 08:05.244
What do I tell Rossabi?

08:05.279 --> 08:06.712
Nothing.

08:06.747 --> 08:08.314
- Nothing?
- It's need-to-know.

08:08.349 --> 08:09.816
He doesn't need to know.

08:09.850 --> 08:11.451
Not according to the DCI.

08:11.485 --> 08:13.319
Collegial cooperation
between domestic agencies.

08:13.354 --> 08:15.721
In this case, they've been
transparent with us.

08:15.756 --> 08:17.356
Annie's my operative.

08:17.391 --> 08:20.293
This is my call.

08:20.327 --> 08:23.363
Tell Rossabi we need
a day to drill down.

08:27.268 --> 08:31.204
Translation, what's a little
lying between friends?

08:45.655 --> 08:49.292
Vincent, I'm on it.

08:49.326 --> 08:51.027
Yeah, I'm not sure
what that means.

08:51.061 --> 08:52.328
It means you were right.

08:52.363 --> 08:54.331
I asked.
There is someone in place.

08:54.365 --> 08:56.233
Okay, is this person
standing down?

08:56.267 --> 08:57.367
We're into it.

08:57.401 --> 08:59.235
Yeah, that fills me
with confidence.

08:59.269 --> 09:01.738
You asked me for a favor,
and I delivered.

09:01.772 --> 09:05.408
Yeah, the Smithsonian fills me
with confidence and gratitude.

09:08.145 --> 09:11.881
I thought we put
that joke to bed.

09:11.915 --> 09:13.816
I'm a creature of habit.

09:13.851 --> 09:16.118
I mean, what do you expect
from a guy who wears wing tips?

09:18.221 --> 09:21.057
Walker?

09:21.091 --> 09:23.158
- Hello?
- I gotta go.

09:23.192 --> 09:25.160
Wait, hold--

09:29.098 --> 09:30.698
It's a lovely day.

09:30.733 --> 09:33.701
Go ahead, say it.

09:33.736 --> 09:37.071
What?

09:37.105 --> 09:38.305
Oh, I told you so.

09:38.340 --> 09:40.574
No, I'm bigger than that.

09:41.943 --> 09:43.411
All right, not really.

09:43.445 --> 09:46.447
Listen, um, since you're
already following me,

09:46.482 --> 09:49.184
why don't you come
and ride with me?

09:49.218 --> 09:51.286
Come on.

09:51.321 --> 09:53.022
Does this mean no tail?

09:53.056 --> 09:55.591
As long as we're together.

09:55.626 --> 09:56.893
Excellent.

09:56.927 --> 09:59.095
Put your seatbelt on.

09:59.129 --> 10:02.465
Or not,
it's your choice.

10:02.499 --> 10:05.701
I bought you a day
to finish up

10:05.736 --> 10:08.571
whatever you need
to finish up.

10:08.605 --> 10:10.406
What if I want
to start something new?

10:10.440 --> 10:12.541
Then I need answers.

10:12.576 --> 10:14.777
What do you wanna know?

10:14.811 --> 10:16.278
Why are you working
Jacob Yassen?

10:16.312 --> 10:17.946
Yassen is of
no importance to us,

10:17.981 --> 10:19.882
but he could put us in contact
with someone who is.

10:19.916 --> 10:21.550
Who?

10:21.584 --> 10:23.084
A deep-cover asset
Mossad has had in place

10:23.119 --> 10:24.752
for over a decade.

10:24.787 --> 10:26.955
What's Mossad doing with
an undercover asset in America?

10:26.989 --> 10:28.856
Don't be naive.

10:31.861 --> 10:34.763
All I can tell you
is that he's gone silent.

10:34.798 --> 10:36.264
We're worried.

10:36.299 --> 10:39.101
Unlike some other
unnamed agencies,

10:39.135 --> 10:41.036
we take care of our own.

10:41.071 --> 10:42.872
It's a matter
of national pride.

10:42.906 --> 10:44.908
Along with the world's
best hummus.

10:47.645 --> 10:50.148
Hey, I thought
you'd be excited.

10:50.182 --> 10:52.283
I am.

10:52.317 --> 10:54.453
Come on, you know
what this means to me.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.823
You know, Peace Corps is
incredibly selective.

10:57.857 --> 11:00.058
Not everyone gets to go,
and they chose me.

11:00.092 --> 11:01.760
I'm excited,
I'm excited.

11:01.794 --> 11:03.595
No, you're not.

11:03.629 --> 11:05.296
Look at you.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.031
All right, it's just...

11:07.066 --> 11:09.133
Eritrea?

11:09.168 --> 11:13.171
Okay, it's not
the garden spot

11:13.205 --> 11:14.806
of the planet,
I know.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.808
Garden spot, no.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.243
Troubled and dangerous, yes.

11:19.278 --> 11:22.513
Okay, you're worried,
and that is very sweet.

11:22.548 --> 11:25.516
But it's not forever.

11:25.550 --> 11:27.351
It's two years.

11:27.385 --> 11:29.820
I just wanna go somewhere
where I'm needed.

11:29.854 --> 11:33.089
And there's need there
in so many ways.

11:33.124 --> 11:34.591
Women's rights, Auggie--

11:34.625 --> 11:37.326
Are virtually nonexistent.

11:37.360 --> 11:39.929
Can't you just
be happy for me?

11:42.566 --> 11:44.533
I am.

11:44.568 --> 11:45.835
And proud.

11:45.869 --> 11:49.038
Very.

11:51.108 --> 11:53.142
You told your folks?

11:53.177 --> 11:55.678
Not yet.

11:55.712 --> 11:57.980
I have time.

11:58.015 --> 12:00.382
Four months.

12:12.429 --> 12:15.398
What's your mission?

12:15.433 --> 12:19.102
Meet with our asset,
assess the risk,

12:19.136 --> 12:21.738
bring him home
if I deem necessary.

12:21.772 --> 12:23.406
Just standard protocol.

12:23.441 --> 12:25.075
And that's it?

12:30.915 --> 12:32.582
Wow, listen to you.

12:32.616 --> 12:34.784
I'm hurt.

12:40.490 --> 12:42.925
Remember, I'm the guy
who cooked for you.

12:42.959 --> 12:46.161
How many men
have cooked for you, huh?

12:46.196 --> 12:47.296
Actually?

12:47.330 --> 12:49.097
Well, cooked organically.

12:49.132 --> 12:50.566
You lied to me yesterday.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.402
Why should I believe you now?
Or ever?

12:53.436 --> 12:57.239
It's Thursday.
I don't lie on Thursdays.

12:57.273 --> 12:59.607
What are you doing?

13:05.847 --> 13:08.849
The FBI are preventing me
from meeting with my asset.

13:08.884 --> 13:11.251
So it's time for plan "B".

13:11.286 --> 13:14.054
What's plan "B"?

13:14.088 --> 13:16.690
Jacob brings
his girlfriends here.

13:16.724 --> 13:18.192
Daddy doesn't know
about this place

13:18.226 --> 13:20.227
and neither do the
mouth-breathers over at the FBI.

13:20.261 --> 13:22.529
What?

13:26.501 --> 13:28.636
You wanna see
how I collect information?

13:28.670 --> 13:31.006
Watch this.

13:45.220 --> 13:47.254
So where is he?

13:51.025 --> 13:53.225
I don't have it.
I told you, I don't know.

13:54.261 --> 13:55.894
What the hell
are you doing?

13:55.929 --> 13:57.763
Plan "B".

14:06.971 --> 14:09.272
This is a mistake.

14:09.577 --> 14:12.085
Jacob, we just need
a moment of your time.

14:12.086 --> 14:13.319
Just for the record,

14:13.354 --> 14:15.154
whatever he's into
I'm not a part of it.

14:15.189 --> 14:16.155
I swear.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.523
Okay, like I said,

14:17.557 --> 14:18.924
sometimes my colleague can
be a little out of control,

14:18.958 --> 14:19.925
and we apologize.

14:19.959 --> 14:23.094
We apologize?

14:23.129 --> 14:24.128
I can leave?

14:24.163 --> 14:25.630
- No.
- Of course.

14:25.664 --> 14:27.732
Or stay.
We'll just be a minute.

14:27.766 --> 14:31.269
Actually,
I was just leaving.

14:31.303 --> 14:34.005
Call me.

14:34.039 --> 14:36.608
She's gonna be on her cell
to the cops--

14:36.642 --> 14:39.177
George, or whatever
you're calling yourself today,

14:39.211 --> 14:40.345
would you focus?

14:40.379 --> 14:42.947
You said your name
was Antonio.

14:42.981 --> 14:44.615
- Who are you people?
- Jacob, look at me.

14:44.650 --> 14:47.485
Never mollycoddle an asset.
That's rule one, chapter one.

14:50.055 --> 14:53.024
All I need from you
is an introduction.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.426
One introduction,
and we're gone.

14:55.460 --> 14:56.527
Really?

14:56.562 --> 14:57.829
That's it,
and it ends.

14:57.863 --> 14:59.597
Introduction to who?

14:59.632 --> 15:02.367
Good question.

15:13.379 --> 15:14.345
I don't--

15:14.380 --> 15:15.980
Listen.

15:16.014 --> 15:17.448
Don't let
my friend here fool you.

15:17.482 --> 15:18.883
I will do what I must.

15:18.917 --> 15:22.487
Jacob, we just need
to know how to reach him.

15:22.521 --> 15:24.623
Okay.

15:24.657 --> 15:27.059
All I am is a messenger.

15:27.093 --> 15:30.195
I pass along information.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.597
That's all.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.232
I leave a mark.

15:34.267 --> 15:37.903
I call a number.

15:37.938 --> 15:40.539
I wait an hour.

15:40.573 --> 15:42.875
If he agrees to meet,

15:42.909 --> 15:46.646
there will be a mark.

15:46.680 --> 15:49.048
That's all I know.

15:53.253 --> 15:56.255
After you leave your mark,
what then?

15:56.289 --> 15:58.591
I said I wait an hour.

16:01.127 --> 16:05.397
I like the water.
It calms me.

16:05.432 --> 16:08.434
I park near the basin
and wait.

16:11.839 --> 16:14.040
I've got some tape
in my kit.

16:17.946 --> 16:20.081
What, are you going to war?

16:20.115 --> 16:21.716
Every day.

16:47.710 --> 16:49.778
Make the call.

17:00.055 --> 17:03.290
So we release him
after this, Antonio.

17:03.325 --> 17:06.393
It was better
than George.

17:06.426 --> 17:07.627
Hey!

17:07.662 --> 17:10.063
Don't just leave me here.

17:11.799 --> 17:14.000
So you said medical school?

17:14.034 --> 17:15.635
Did you finish?

17:15.669 --> 17:17.704
No.

17:17.738 --> 17:19.973
What happened?

17:21.877 --> 17:23.777
2002, my family needed me,

17:23.811 --> 17:26.213
and, uh, so I took
a leave of absence,

17:26.248 --> 17:27.548
never went back.

17:27.582 --> 17:32.086
"Dr. Lavin" has kind of
a nice ring to it.

17:32.120 --> 17:35.422
You and my mother.

17:35.456 --> 17:38.558
- You regret not going back?
- No.

17:38.593 --> 17:40.860
It's different in Israel.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.795
Our ambitions
are about life,

17:42.830 --> 17:44.896
living well,
not our careers.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.899
What about having both?

17:46.933 --> 17:50.001
See, now that's
very American.

17:50.036 --> 17:52.237
Life takes you
where it takes you.

17:52.271 --> 17:54.907
You can only steer so much,
sometimes not at all.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.675
History taught us that.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.443
Don't fight the current,
is that it?

17:58.478 --> 18:00.579
Or swim with it.

18:00.613 --> 18:03.849
Instead of fighting,
live your life.

18:03.883 --> 18:06.785
Yeah, the current may know
something you don't.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.422
Doesn't sound
like you at all.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.591
Why not?
It's completely me.

18:12.626 --> 18:15.928
Sometimes you just have
to let the river take you.

18:15.962 --> 18:19.298
And where has
the river taken you?

18:23.470 --> 18:24.903
Today...

18:24.938 --> 18:28.307
It's taken me here.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.375
With you.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.780
You guys,

18:34.814 --> 18:36.348
I'm thirsty!

18:38.651 --> 18:40.219
- I got it.
- Thanks.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.154
Auggie.

18:42.188 --> 18:45.457
Joan,
I have a favor to ask.

18:47.594 --> 18:50.061
Maybe I've come
at the wrong time.

18:50.096 --> 18:51.329
Auggie.

18:55.101 --> 18:57.235
I have this friend.

18:57.269 --> 18:58.970
You have this friend.

18:59.004 --> 19:01.472
Who's received an assignment
with the Peace Corps

19:01.506 --> 19:05.710
to serve in,
of all places, Eritrea.

19:05.744 --> 19:06.811
Hmm.

19:06.845 --> 19:08.846
Exactly.

19:08.881 --> 19:12.383
So this friend...

19:12.418 --> 19:15.420
Is the sister of a soldier
I served with in Iraq.

19:15.454 --> 19:17.088
She's all
her parents have left.

19:17.123 --> 19:19.490
I just--
- Auggie, you realize

19:19.525 --> 19:22.626
the Agency has
no official involvement

19:22.660 --> 19:24.061
with the Peace Corps.

19:24.095 --> 19:25.762
I'm not asking officially.

19:25.797 --> 19:27.430
You're just asking?

19:27.465 --> 19:29.165
Which is something
I have never done.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.368
This family's
been through a lot.

19:31.402 --> 19:35.072
I'd like to spare them and her,
if I can.

19:35.106 --> 19:37.741
So you want a reassignment,
that's what you're asking?

19:37.775 --> 19:38.909
Service is still service.

19:38.943 --> 19:40.144
No matter where it occurs,

19:40.178 --> 19:43.614
it doesn't make the need
any less valuable.

19:43.648 --> 19:45.783
Write a letter.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.452
Make a request.

19:47.486 --> 19:49.988
I'll make sure it gets
in the right hands.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.557
But there are no guarantees.

19:52.591 --> 19:56.226
Of course,
I understand.

19:56.261 --> 19:58.062
Thank you.

20:00.698 --> 20:03.400
Auggie.

20:03.434 --> 20:05.068
Glad you came to me.

20:07.971 --> 20:09.538
I'd like to know
who we're going to meet.

20:09.573 --> 20:10.973
I already told you.

20:11.007 --> 20:13.476
Yeah, and then you
needlessly manhandled

20:13.510 --> 20:14.877
our passenger here.

20:14.912 --> 20:17.146
Definitely needlessly.

20:17.181 --> 20:19.449
Who is it?

20:19.483 --> 20:21.484
Put this on him, please.

20:28.292 --> 20:29.292
Come here.

20:34.164 --> 20:35.831
Van Halen.

20:35.865 --> 20:39.134
David Lee Roth era,
the good stuff.

20:39.169 --> 20:40.602
Enjoy.

20:43.306 --> 20:45.007
I only know him
by his code name.

20:45.041 --> 20:46.108
Cardinal.

20:46.142 --> 20:47.609
That's a start,

20:47.644 --> 20:49.445
an asset named Cardinal.

20:49.479 --> 20:52.080
Not an asset.

20:52.114 --> 20:54.483
Civilians get
alphanumeric designations.

20:54.517 --> 20:56.018
What is he?

20:56.052 --> 20:59.488
He's a Mossad operative.

20:59.523 --> 21:01.924
But he's not spying
on any U.S. interests.

21:01.959 --> 21:03.326
Yeah, who is he spying on?

21:03.361 --> 21:05.696
Not the U.S.

21:05.730 --> 21:08.365
I have to call Langley
and check in.

21:14.506 --> 21:16.273
Hey!

21:16.307 --> 21:17.774
I can't believe you did that.

21:17.809 --> 21:19.510
What is it with you
and cell phones?

21:19.544 --> 21:22.379
What is it with you
and always checking in?

21:22.414 --> 21:24.414
Ah--

21:24.449 --> 21:27.684
You know what, it feels good.
You should try it.

21:27.719 --> 21:28.785
Might be liberating.

21:28.820 --> 21:30.220
Give me your phone.

21:30.254 --> 21:31.221
Absolutely not.

21:31.255 --> 21:32.389
- Eyal.
- Forget it.

21:32.423 --> 21:33.423
It switched to Abba.

21:33.458 --> 21:34.658
Do you have this on shuffle?

21:34.692 --> 21:37.195
You owe me a phone.

21:46.172 --> 21:49.341
Look, I've done
what you wanted.

21:52.145 --> 21:53.846
What's your next protocol?

21:53.880 --> 21:56.315
Dude, I feel
really light-headed.

21:56.349 --> 21:58.217
Once we have eyes
on your man,

21:58.251 --> 21:59.818
you'll be released.

21:59.853 --> 22:02.588
Just...

22:02.623 --> 22:05.157
Just drive straight and take
a left on "C" street.

22:17.904 --> 22:19.404
It's just up there
on the right.

22:19.438 --> 22:21.840
What's this?

22:35.622 --> 22:39.057
He set us up.
He set us up!

22:43.630 --> 22:45.464
Annie.

22:51.805 --> 22:54.240
Come on, come on.

23:01.415 --> 23:03.216
Whoa, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go.

23:37.185 --> 23:38.485
Take a step back.

23:38.519 --> 23:40.987
Move it.

23:41.021 --> 23:43.856
More.

23:43.891 --> 23:46.259
You took care
of it for me, huh?

23:56.640 --> 23:59.008
You just ruined my afternoon,

23:59.042 --> 24:03.112
and now my informant, after
three years of work, is dead.

24:03.146 --> 24:05.081
I understand
your frustration.

24:05.115 --> 24:06.516
Do you really?

24:06.550 --> 24:09.453
Because the last time I saw you,
you were a lawyer.

24:09.487 --> 24:12.855
She's Smithsonian and who
the hell knows who this guy is.

24:12.890 --> 24:14.724
It's a damn costume party!

24:14.758 --> 24:16.558
I am here to set
things straight, so--

24:16.593 --> 24:18.260
Okay, well, let me
tell you something.

24:18.294 --> 24:20.595
The stink is sure as hell
gonna reach your office

24:20.629 --> 24:22.797
because my boss
is talking to your boss.

24:22.832 --> 24:25.533
This has not gone vertical,
this has gone ballistic.

24:25.568 --> 24:28.903
Let's stick to the matters
at hand, shall we?

24:28.938 --> 24:31.907
Ms. Walker here will remain
and debrief your people.

24:31.941 --> 24:34.642
This individual
is not who he says he is.

24:34.677 --> 24:35.844
I've been ordered to
ship him home.

24:35.878 --> 24:37.679
Where is home?

24:37.713 --> 24:41.149
- The Middle East.
- Israel.

24:41.184 --> 24:43.185
He's Mossad.

24:43.219 --> 24:45.521
I'm looking that he talks.

24:50.895 --> 24:55.364
Our intention is to extend to
you every courtesy we can,

24:55.398 --> 24:58.668
even though it may not appear
that way with some of us.

24:58.702 --> 25:00.336
That your version
of an apology?

25:04.173 --> 25:06.808
Listen, uh,

25:06.842 --> 25:09.109
not that I don't
appreciate the hospitality,

25:09.144 --> 25:10.277
but I don't debrief.

25:10.311 --> 25:12.346
Good.
'Cause we're not interested.

25:12.380 --> 25:14.515
Your superiors,
however, are.

25:14.549 --> 25:15.516
You have an appointment
at King Saul,

25:15.550 --> 25:16.851
and I hear
individuals there

25:16.885 --> 25:18.719
are very anxious
to hear your thoughts.

25:18.753 --> 25:21.555
Let's go.

25:21.590 --> 25:25.226
And you will not be back.
Ever.

25:25.260 --> 25:26.393
If it were up to me,

25:26.428 --> 25:28.628
I would personally
walk you to your cell

25:28.663 --> 25:30.831
and throw the key away.

25:30.865 --> 25:33.166
Take him to his plane.

25:40.173 --> 25:42.474
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. No, no.

25:42.508 --> 25:44.943
Let's talk.

25:46.646 --> 25:48.847
No doubt
you can find your way out.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.849
You are spooks, after all.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.355
You are either personally
undermining me

25:56.390 --> 25:58.825
or your promotion has affected
your better judgement--

25:58.859 --> 26:00.627
if such a thing ever existed.

26:00.661 --> 26:03.863
In the future, if you have
anything to say to me,

26:03.898 --> 26:06.300
you will hold your tongue
and speak to me privately.

26:06.334 --> 26:10.071
Or better yet,
keep it to yourself.

26:39.402 --> 26:43.672
Do my ears deceive me?

26:43.706 --> 26:45.474
A friendly face.

26:45.508 --> 26:48.577
Nice job
with a tough situation.

26:48.612 --> 26:50.480
Tough girls tough it out.

26:50.514 --> 26:52.248
I like it.

26:52.282 --> 26:54.984
You want the good news
or the good news?

26:55.019 --> 26:56.853
Yes, please.

26:56.887 --> 27:00.757
FBI rolled up
one of the shooters.

27:00.791 --> 27:02.191
He talked.

27:02.226 --> 27:05.027
The Bureau's planning on
taking down Eyal's man tonight,

27:05.062 --> 27:07.396
and once that happens,
everybody wins,

27:07.430 --> 27:10.365
and you are off the hook,
Annie Walker.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.869
Eyal said his name
was Cardinal.

27:13.903 --> 27:15.170
FBI is being tight-lipped.

27:15.204 --> 27:17.506
Mossad isn't
returning Joan's calls.

27:17.540 --> 27:19.441
Upstairs ordered an NIE.

27:19.475 --> 27:20.442
Until then,
we don't know.

27:20.476 --> 27:22.110
Eyal said he's a Mossad op.

27:22.145 --> 27:24.012
Oh, he's anything but that.

27:24.047 --> 27:26.548
Arab desk thinks he might be
a Yemeni hitter,

27:26.583 --> 27:29.218
but whatever he is,
justice is holding him

27:29.252 --> 27:32.121
on a conspiracy
to murder charge.

27:32.156 --> 27:35.358
Give state
time to do their thing.

27:35.392 --> 27:37.627
This isn't your fault,

27:37.662 --> 27:39.496
and no one thinks that.

27:39.530 --> 27:41.231
What about Eyal?

27:41.266 --> 27:43.067
He's got this own problems.

27:43.101 --> 27:45.670
Halfway across the Atlantic.

27:47.006 --> 27:48.640
A Yemeni hitter, huh?

27:48.675 --> 27:50.476
Chatter says
he may have been involved

27:50.510 --> 27:51.576
in the '02 peace talks thing.

27:51.611 --> 27:52.811
Do remember that?

27:52.845 --> 27:55.880
The Golan Heights massacre?
Stopped the talks?

27:58.518 --> 28:00.553
2002?

28:00.587 --> 28:01.554
Yeah.

28:01.588 --> 28:03.690
Huh.

28:03.724 --> 28:05.726
You okay?

28:05.760 --> 28:09.195
Uh, yeah, thanks.
I'll see you later.

28:48.807 --> 28:50.807
You're right.
Pretty good.

28:52.099 --> 28:56.101
Somehow I knew
you'd be here...

28:56.136 --> 28:57.536
But how?

28:57.571 --> 28:59.539
They put me
on a commercial flight.

29:01.675 --> 29:07.080
Turns out, the air marshal
was a former Mossad Agent.

29:08.683 --> 29:10.584
It's more common
than people know.

29:10.618 --> 29:12.885
Good money. Decent hours.
Travel the world.

29:12.920 --> 29:15.088
Who wouldn't hire Mossad,
right?

29:15.122 --> 29:18.257
So, uh, he did me a favor.

29:18.292 --> 29:20.660
The FBI
should know better.

29:21.728 --> 29:23.563
Looks like you did.

29:27.267 --> 29:31.270
You're not gonna leave
until you've finished, are you?

29:31.304 --> 29:33.005
There's nothing humanitarian
about your mission.

29:33.039 --> 29:34.473
You're here
to kill Cardinal.

29:40.147 --> 29:42.815
Let me get you a drink.
Uh, two more, please.

29:42.850 --> 29:45.585
Macallan. Eighteen.
Neat.

29:51.392 --> 29:56.295
Cardinal's real name
is Fouad Saeed.

29:56.329 --> 29:59.198
In 2002, when I was
in med school in Tel Aviv,

29:59.232 --> 30:02.934
Saeed entered a kibbutz
near the Golan Heights,

30:02.969 --> 30:06.671
assassinated an IDF guard

30:06.705 --> 30:09.807
and six kibbutzniks.

30:09.841 --> 30:13.378
He was hoping to
poison the peace talks.

30:15.148 --> 30:18.016
One of the civilians killed
was my sister.

30:20.186 --> 30:23.790
I love my country and
I would do anything for it,

30:23.824 --> 30:27.127
but Fouad Saeed is the reason
I became a Mossad Agent.

30:33.835 --> 30:35.902
Thank you.

30:40.874 --> 30:45.311
Nine years,
two months, eight days.

30:47.013 --> 30:49.748
Her name was Sarah,

30:49.782 --> 30:53.418
after our grandmother,
who died in Treblinka.

30:56.089 --> 31:00.259
Why are you here,
Annie Walker?

31:01.761 --> 31:03.896
This is a suicide mission.

31:07.934 --> 31:09.435
Don't do it.

31:10.604 --> 31:13.339
It's not
what your sister would want.

31:15.342 --> 31:17.778
Well, you didn't know
my sister.

31:17.812 --> 31:20.281
This is exactly
what she would have wanted.

31:22.751 --> 31:28.056
See, we know this is when
you fight the current.

31:32.428 --> 31:36.731
Again, why are you still here,
Annie Walker?

32:59.585 --> 33:03.455
- Huh.
Classic honey-trap.

33:03.489 --> 33:04.957
It's for your own good.

33:04.991 --> 33:06.692
Of course,
I saw it coming.

33:06.726 --> 33:08.728
I mean, you need to
work on your technique.

33:08.762 --> 33:10.530
There's nothing wrong
with my technique.

33:10.564 --> 33:12.965
I was simply
being a gentleman.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.802
The FBI is
gonna take down Saeed,

33:15.836 --> 33:18.205
and your inclinations to
play by your own rules

33:18.239 --> 33:20.306
will undoubtedly get
in the way, so--

33:20.341 --> 33:21.308
You think
this will hold me?

33:21.342 --> 33:23.977
Long enough for my needs.

33:24.011 --> 33:27.814
If this is how you treat
a man, I think I like it.

33:29.016 --> 33:32.052
As soon as the FBI
has Saeed in custody,

33:32.086 --> 33:35.555
I'll come back
and, uh, set you free.

33:35.590 --> 33:37.658
Where are you going?

33:37.692 --> 33:39.093
I gotta
make a phone call.

33:39.127 --> 33:43.497
And since someone threw my phone
out of a moving car--

33:48.704 --> 33:50.939
I gotta say,
I'm, uh, I'm impressed.

33:52.775 --> 33:54.176
I'll be right back.

33:54.210 --> 33:55.911
I'll be here.

34:03.688 --> 34:05.889
Auggie, where are we
at with the, uh--

34:05.924 --> 34:08.426
- Huh. Interesting number.
- I lost my phone.

34:08.460 --> 34:09.960
We know.

34:09.995 --> 34:11.862
We've been pondering that
and other things.

34:11.897 --> 34:14.098
Eyal never made it
to Israel.

34:14.132 --> 34:15.433
What have we got
from the FBI?

34:15.467 --> 34:17.635
Impeccable timing as always,
Walker.

34:17.670 --> 34:18.837
Just got off the wire.

34:18.871 --> 34:20.638
Feds traced a tip
from the shooter

34:20.672 --> 34:22.540
to an apartment
in Anacostia.

34:22.574 --> 34:25.409
Cardinal wasn't there. Hoover
building is in a tizzy.

34:25.444 --> 34:28.045
How does that happen?

34:28.080 --> 34:29.981
Look, Auggie, I have Eyal.

34:30.014 --> 34:32.650
He didn't leave.
We're at the Chatham.

34:32.684 --> 34:34.118
Are you with him now?

34:34.152 --> 34:37.855
No, he's in his room,
but, uh--

34:37.889 --> 34:38.956
oh, my God.

34:38.991 --> 34:40.257
What?

34:44.295 --> 34:45.429
He's here.

34:45.464 --> 34:47.532
Who?

34:47.565 --> 34:48.833
Cardinal.

34:48.867 --> 34:52.670
Are you certain?

34:52.705 --> 34:54.606
Yes. It's him
and two friends.

35:01.481 --> 35:04.282
Eyal knew.
That's why he stayed.

35:06.052 --> 35:07.519
He knew they'd come.

35:09.021 --> 35:13.157
Jai has a team in the field.
Annie, they're en route.

35:13.192 --> 35:15.360
Do not handle by yourself.

35:16.662 --> 35:18.663
I gotta go.

36:07.029 --> 36:09.588
Jai,
she needs you there now!

36:09.589 --> 36:10.161
Copy that.

36:12.969 --> 36:14.036
I'm here.

36:14.070 --> 36:15.770
We've got three bogies
in the elevator.

36:15.804 --> 36:17.004
One of them is Saeed.

36:17.039 --> 36:19.206
They're on their way
to the eighth floor.

36:19.241 --> 36:20.675
Annie's taking the stairs.

38:29.870 --> 38:30.837
You okay?

38:30.871 --> 38:32.572
Yeah, yeah.

38:38.180 --> 38:40.180
Okay, okay.

38:45.220 --> 38:47.488
Let me get this straight.
Who shot who?

38:47.522 --> 38:49.123
He didn't shoot anyone.

38:51.627 --> 38:53.527
You shot him.

38:53.562 --> 38:56.464
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right.

38:56.498 --> 38:57.665
Self defense.

39:00.402 --> 39:02.136
I still don't even
know who you are.

39:06.475 --> 39:09.276
This is the last time
I ask you for a favor.

39:12.413 --> 39:14.148
Thanks.

39:14.182 --> 39:16.716
Anytime.

39:27.496 --> 39:29.497
You knew he'd come.

39:31.867 --> 39:33.868
So what now?

39:35.604 --> 39:38.806
I guess I'll see
where the current takes me.

40:04.466 --> 40:07.602
This is not
a change of assignment letter.

40:07.637 --> 40:10.772
It is my "close and
continuing relationship" form.

40:10.806 --> 40:12.374
I realize that the reason

40:12.408 --> 40:13.675
I don't want her to go to
Eritrea is the same reason

40:13.710 --> 40:15.578
I don't want her
to go anywhere.

40:15.612 --> 40:18.548
We have four months left
until she leaves

40:18.582 --> 40:21.118
and I plan on making
the most of it.

40:21.152 --> 40:24.087
Per protocol,
I'm informing the Agency.

40:24.122 --> 40:26.624
Lucky girl.

40:50.182 --> 40:53.452
- A Sazerac. Ice cold, please.
- Sure.
