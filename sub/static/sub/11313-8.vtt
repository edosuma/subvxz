WEBVTT

00:10.077 --> 00:13.712
Everything was built on blood.

00:13.714 --> 00:16.915
I seen a shadow run
towards the bathroom.

00:16.917 --> 00:20.085
It's almost
like a joint poltergeist.

00:20.087 --> 00:22.621
They just keep beating
each other.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.423
They were chasing geese
across the pond

00:24.425 --> 00:25.858
and ended up drowning.

00:25.860 --> 00:29.661
The attacks become more violent.

00:29.663 --> 00:33.165
I'm hearing, like,
"Get out of the house."

00:33.167 --> 00:35.667
The blood is still flowing.

00:35.669 --> 00:39.071
Good energy stops right here.

00:39.073 --> 00:40.973
I just hear death.

00:40.975 --> 00:42.941
My name is Amy Allan.

00:42.943 --> 00:44.576
God.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.445
It's like,
"I'm going to get you."

00:46.447 --> 00:48.947
I see dead people.
Her face was all demonic.

00:48.949 --> 00:50.916
I speak to dead people.

00:50.918 --> 00:52.551
He's like,
"You think you can stop me?

00:52.553 --> 00:54.520
Because you can't."
And they speak to me.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.588
What is he trying to do?
Kill them.

00:56.590 --> 00:59.491
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real...

00:59.493 --> 01:01.393
Something happened.
Bam, bam, bam.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.995
I rely on my partner.

01:02.997 --> 01:04.495
I'm Steve di Schiavi.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.365
I'm retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:06.367 --> 01:07.633
Am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?

01:07.635 --> 01:11.336
And I know every person,
every house, has secrets.

01:11.338 --> 01:13.739
They everywhere.
It's my job to reveal them.

01:13.741 --> 01:16.675
This guy's got the markings
of a serial killer.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.510
But Steve and I never speak.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.579
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:20.581 --> 01:21.747
Until the very end.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.382
Is this Sted guy
doing that to her?

01:23.384 --> 01:25.651
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

01:25.653 --> 01:27.086
That's it.

01:27.088 --> 01:29.488
Or time to get out.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.523
Somebody's gonna
die over there soon.

01:31.525 --> 01:33.292
Yeah.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074

01:47.274 --> 01:50.976
I'm in the city of Magna, Utah
just west of Salt Lake City.

01:50.978 --> 01:52.744
Now, I took this case
for two reasons.

01:52.746 --> 01:55.314
First, the woman
who called us in.

01:55.316 --> 01:57.916
She was crying on the phone
and sounded really scared.

01:57.918 --> 02:00.752
Second, there are kids involved,
three of them.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.121
And according to their mom

02:02.123 --> 02:04.323
they are being physically
and psychologically attacked

02:04.325 --> 02:05.958
by whatever's in that house.

02:09.196 --> 02:11.363
Before Amy arrives I throw
the house

02:11.365 --> 02:13.432
of any leading information.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.501
Family photographs
and other personal items

02:15.503 --> 02:17.503
can influence her findings

02:17.505 --> 02:20.405
so it's important I cover
or remove them all.

02:20.407 --> 02:22.207
When I'm finished
the location will be ready

02:22.209 --> 02:23.942
for tonight's walk.

02:35.356 --> 02:39.491
Good energy is not making
it into this home.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.793
Good energy stops right here.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.169
Unfortunately the people

02:50.171 --> 02:54.439
who've moved
into this place,

02:54.441 --> 02:56.742
have not been very stable.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.076
And because of all of

02:58.078 --> 03:02.548
that they're pulling
in this negative energy.

03:02.550 --> 03:05.651
The dead are attracted
to this location

03:05.653 --> 03:09.354
because of all the drama
and craziness.

03:09.356 --> 03:12.424
I feel really horrible,
sick, sick, sick.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.699
So, Jennie,

03:20.701 --> 03:24.403
when we spoke on the phone
you sounded really upset.

03:24.405 --> 03:27.940
The reason I took this case
is because it involved children.

03:27.942 --> 03:29.374
Yes.
Your kids are going through

03:29.376 --> 03:32.377
a rough time here?
Yes, late nights with the kids.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.112
They are not sleeping
in their rooms,

03:34.114 --> 03:35.547
they're staying up.

03:35.549 --> 03:39.318
And once I really started seeing
my kids go through things...

03:39.320 --> 03:41.720
Right.
That's when it's hard.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.755
Especially for my youngest.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.023
She is, like, so scared.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.125
She tries running
out of the house.

03:47.127 --> 03:51.029
And so that's when you, like,
don't know what to do anymore.

03:51.031 --> 03:53.498
It's not anything any kid
should have to go through.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.535
No, especially when you can't
explain anything to them.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.537
Like, when they ask,
you know, why or what.

03:58.539 --> 04:02.007
And it's like you don't
have really anything for them.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.175
All right.

04:03.177 --> 04:05.110
So who exactly lives
in the house with you?

04:05.112 --> 04:07.079
That's all of us.

04:07.081 --> 04:08.647
All right.
So who's here?

04:08.649 --> 04:11.183
This is Lexie, she's 11.

04:11.185 --> 04:13.518
And that's Summer, she's 7.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.954
Okay.
And then that's me.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.322
That's my son Zeke.
He's 12.

04:18.325 --> 04:20.858
Okay.
And then my husband.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.961
Okay.
And he's 30.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.763
And then, that's my mom.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.765
So Jennie, has your mom
always lived with you?

04:26.767 --> 04:29.201
No, we moved her in

04:29.203 --> 04:31.270
because she was having
some surgeries done.

04:31.272 --> 04:32.704
What kind of surgeries?

04:32.706 --> 04:35.907
She's had to have some surgeries
to remove her brain tumor.

04:35.909 --> 04:38.176
Really?
This one was cancer,

04:38.178 --> 04:39.678
like a stage two.
Okay.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.913
So she's had to go
through radiation.

04:41.915 --> 04:44.283
It kinda did a number
on her this time.

04:44.285 --> 04:47.452
She still gets really bad
headaches sometimes.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.792
I don't like this.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.260
Headaches.

04:55.262 --> 04:58.163
Constant headaches, headaches,
headaches, headaches, headaches,

04:58.165 --> 05:00.265
stress, stress.

05:00.267 --> 05:03.769
Constant stress and headaches.

05:08.208 --> 05:09.608
There's abuse.

05:09.610 --> 05:14.613
I think it was some time ago.

05:14.615 --> 05:15.981
This person... This is,

05:15.983 --> 05:20.319
like, a safe haven
to get away from everything.

05:20.321 --> 05:23.722
But there is no really
getting away from everything.

05:23.724 --> 05:28.627
Being in here makes it worse.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.028
How long have you guys
been living here?

05:30.030 --> 05:31.563
Since 2008.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.398
It was a beautiful house,
you know,

05:33.400 --> 05:35.267
somewhere nice
to raise the kids.

05:35.269 --> 05:37.602
So, Jennie, do you know
any history on the property?

05:37.604 --> 05:39.237
Anything?
Not a lot except for

05:39.239 --> 05:40.839
that it's a mining town.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.074
A mining town?
Yeah.

05:42.076 --> 05:43.642
That's interesting to know.
Okay.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.911
Any idea what kind of --
what they're mining here?

05:45.913 --> 05:47.012
It might be copper.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.213
Okay.
All right, Jennie.

05:48.215 --> 05:49.848
So do me a favor
and give me a list of the things

05:49.850 --> 05:51.416
you guys are experiencing.

05:51.418 --> 05:53.552
Bangs, voices

05:53.554 --> 05:55.387
and now things are moving.

05:55.389 --> 05:58.457
And we see dark shadows.

05:58.459 --> 06:01.026
And now it's gotten physical.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.527
Okay.
Physical with who?

06:02.529 --> 06:03.995
My daughter Lexie.

06:03.997 --> 06:06.431
She got scratched.

06:06.433 --> 06:07.833
That's gotta be killing you.

06:07.835 --> 06:11.103
She's so scared
that something's gonna hurt her.

06:11.105 --> 06:13.805
That's the hardest part.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.374
I don't get a lot of sleep.

06:15.376 --> 06:17.943
We do a lot of camping
out in the living room.

06:17.945 --> 06:19.745
Have you guys done anything
to be proactive?

06:19.747 --> 06:21.246
Like, have you had
the house blessed?

06:21.248 --> 06:23.248
Have you done anything?
Um, we've tried

06:23.250 --> 06:24.483
blessing it ourselves.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.818
We went and burned sage
through the house...

06:26.820 --> 06:28.920
Okay.
And, you know, salt.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.255
Did it work?

06:30.257 --> 06:32.524
No, it actually got a lot worse.

06:37.731 --> 06:41.666
Somebody did something out here.

06:41.668 --> 06:44.970
Some kind of protection thing.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.438
But it's wrong.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.373
It wasn't done right.

06:48.375 --> 06:54.379
It pushed all the bad, icky
**** inside.

06:54.381 --> 06:58.650
It created this, like,
suction thing that's sucking in,

06:58.652 --> 07:02.387
crazy ****.

07:02.389 --> 07:05.056
And it's keeping good stuff out.

07:11.632 --> 07:14.433
So, Jennie, why'd you take me
into the master bedroom?

07:14.435 --> 07:18.603
This is where,
um, I have experiences.

07:18.605 --> 07:21.640
One night, I got woken up
to the sheets

07:21.642 --> 07:23.208
being moved off of me and,

07:23.210 --> 07:26.378
like, somebody just touching me,
like, rubbing my shoulder.

07:26.380 --> 07:27.712
Now is there any way possible

07:27.714 --> 07:29.014
that your husband
coulda been strokin' your arm?

07:29.016 --> 07:32.551
Um, no, he was sleeping facing
towards the window.

07:32.553 --> 07:33.819
Okay, physically
he couldn't have done it.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.487
No.

07:35.489 --> 07:36.688
Anything else?

07:36.690 --> 07:38.657
I will just be laying in bed...
Okay.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.559
And I will get woken up
by a humming

07:40.561 --> 07:42.527
electric sound.
Okay.

07:42.529 --> 07:43.895
And then all of
a sudden these shadows

07:43.897 --> 07:45.797
will come from over there,

07:45.799 --> 07:47.199
from my dresser, and,

07:47.201 --> 07:49.100
like, they will slowly
start moving into me.

07:49.102 --> 07:51.036
And they're darker shadows.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.804
And you can hear
them whispering.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.006
And so I'm just
frozen there with them

07:55.008 --> 07:56.708
just standing over me.

07:56.710 --> 07:57.742
You must freak out
when you see this thing.

07:57.744 --> 07:59.244
I do.
One time

07:59.246 --> 08:00.979
I said, "Okay, just take me."

08:00.981 --> 08:02.414
Like, I'm in full blown panic.

08:02.416 --> 08:03.715
So, like,
your heart's racing...

08:03.717 --> 08:04.983
Right.
You're sweating,

08:04.985 --> 08:06.718
but I can't move, I can't talk.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.760
I see a woman.

08:15.762 --> 08:20.131
She looks like late thirties.

08:20.133 --> 08:25.737
And she is alive, crying.

08:25.739 --> 08:29.374
And she feels very lonely.

08:29.376 --> 08:32.611
She feels
like she's been deserted.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.212
A lot of despair.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.817
I saw a younger male.

08:38.818 --> 08:41.385
He's a mess.
He's a mess.

08:41.388 --> 08:44.890
He's done a lot
of really bad things

08:44.892 --> 08:46.892
in his life.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.927
I think he's a addict.

08:48.929 --> 08:52.197
He's done just terrible things.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.232
And I don't know
if he lives here

08:54.234 --> 08:55.667
or if he lived here.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.802
But I definitely got

08:57.804 --> 09:02.941
that he left a lot
of energy behind.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.110
And there was
something about guns.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.450
Seems like Jennie
is having a rough time.

09:12.452 --> 09:14.553
Are you?
Yes.

09:14.555 --> 09:16.588
Tell me about the experiences
you've had.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.156
I was walkin' into my room.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.225
I seen clothes swinging

09:20.227 --> 09:23.028
and a shadow run
towards the bathroom.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.095
At the same time?

09:24.097 --> 09:25.931
At the same time.
And you're sure

09:25.933 --> 09:27.566
it wasn't one of the kids
running through the bed room?

09:27.568 --> 09:29.668
No, they were all in school.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.169
Okay, anything else?

09:31.171 --> 09:32.604
I walked into the laundry room

09:32.606 --> 09:34.139
and there was somebody
standing there.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.707
I asked him, "Who are you?

09:35.709 --> 09:37.142
What are you doing here?"

09:37.144 --> 09:40.712
He just stood there,
blank stare at me and then gone.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.480
He just vanished.

09:42.482 --> 09:43.982
Okay, describe him to me.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.550
Complete black.

09:45.552 --> 09:48.420
Couldn't make out
a face or anything.

09:48.422 --> 09:49.621
How do you explain it?

09:49.623 --> 09:52.023
I can't figure it out.
Okay.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.291
That must've scared
the hell outta you.

09:53.293 --> 09:56.227
It scares the ****
out of me is what it does.

10:00.534 --> 10:02.400
Somebody was in here.

10:02.402 --> 10:08.607
A living person felt their hairs
stand up, turned,

10:08.609 --> 10:12.877
saw a shadow figure move.

10:16.216 --> 10:19.784
More than once they've seen
this, more than once.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.252
The drug addict guy

10:21.254 --> 10:24.122
is projecting himself
as the shadow figure.

10:27.561 --> 10:30.528
This is a --
not good place.

10:53.387 --> 10:55.153
Let me ask you a question.
How old are you?

10:55.155 --> 10:56.821
I'm 12.
Twelve.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.224
So, Zeke, tell me
about what you're seeing.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.092
A green guy.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.293
He comes through the wall

11:02.295 --> 11:04.596
and first you
hear a big old bang

11:04.598 --> 11:07.499
and then I wake up
and I see him.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.768
And it's coming from that wall.
Here?

11:09.770 --> 11:12.003
Yep.
All right.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.471
You're 12.
All right.

11:13.473 --> 11:16.074
Are you fooling around taking
any of mommy and daddy's pills

11:16.076 --> 11:17.108
or anything like that?

11:17.110 --> 11:18.710
No.
All right.

11:18.712 --> 11:20.979
So you're not hallucinating
when you're seeing this stuff?

11:20.981 --> 11:22.247
No.

11:22.249 --> 11:24.549
Are you -- are you hearing
or seeing anything else?

11:24.551 --> 11:29.754
I'm seeing a guy with a hat.

11:29.756 --> 11:30.922
Okay.

11:30.924 --> 11:34.125
Comes up through my

11:34.127 --> 11:38.697
ceiling
in my closet.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.999
Okay, can you see
any features on this thing?

11:41.001 --> 11:44.235
No, just the hat.
All right. So, anything else?

11:44.237 --> 11:50.108
Um, I've heard the chairs moving
and the table moving.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.676
Where?
In -- in the kitchen?

11:51.678 --> 11:54.012
Yeah.
Okay, so when you heard it move

11:54.014 --> 11:55.513
did you go out there
and check it out?

11:55.515 --> 11:56.915
Yeah.
And what'd you see?

11:56.917 --> 12:00.819
Nothing, I looked
just as normal.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.887
The stuff you're seeing is
pretty wild for an adult to see.

12:02.889 --> 12:06.057
Um, you realize this is not
normal for a 12 year old?

12:06.059 --> 12:07.792
Yeah.

12:11.832 --> 12:14.866
Everybody who's alive
in the house, um,

12:14.868 --> 12:16.868
is like beating on each other.

12:16.870 --> 12:20.472
It's almost, like, a joint,

12:20.474 --> 12:24.142
like, poltergeist
from all these people.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.079
They're, like,
literally taking ****

12:28.081 --> 12:31.082
down on one another
via this poltergeist.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.450
I know they're seeing things

12:32.452 --> 12:36.855
but I can't quite see
what they're seeing.

12:40.193 --> 12:43.928
I don't know what's going on
with the -- the ceiling.

12:47.033 --> 12:52.003
I'm feeling like a lot
of physical assaults here,

12:52.005 --> 12:55.907
and this is from living people
to other living people.

12:55.909 --> 12:58.943
It's just a **** mess.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.119
So, Summer, tell me, honey,
how old are you?

13:08.121 --> 13:10.455
Seven.
So, Summer, I understand

13:10.457 --> 13:14.292
that you sleep out here most of
the time, is that right?

13:14.294 --> 13:16.194
Okay, because you're afraid
of your room?

13:17.731 --> 13:20.965
Okay, do you ever seen anything
when you're sleeping out here?

13:20.967 --> 13:23.568
Yeah.
I see people.

13:23.570 --> 13:27.071
I -- I think they are trying
to hurt me.

13:27.073 --> 13:28.439
All right,
where do you see them?

13:28.441 --> 13:32.110
In my room, in the kitchen
and the bathroom.

13:32.112 --> 13:34.746
Okay, what else
are you hearing or seeing?

13:38.451 --> 13:39.717
I freak out.

13:39.719 --> 13:42.520
My parents come upstairs
and they check on me

13:42.522 --> 13:44.856
and I wake everybody up.

13:44.858 --> 13:48.126
Okay.
And I was like,

13:48.128 --> 13:49.561
"Call the cops."

13:49.563 --> 13:52.030
You're scared
of this place, honey?

13:52.032 --> 13:53.331
Yeah.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.567
Well, we're here to try
to get rid of everything.

13:55.569 --> 13:58.837
Would you like to go sleep
in your own room again?

13:58.839 --> 14:00.572
Okay.

14:02.976 --> 14:06.044
I would think
that the living here

14:06.046 --> 14:07.712
are experiencing things

14:07.714 --> 14:09.848
like, you know,
feeling slapped,

14:09.850 --> 14:13.785
headaches, panic attacks
for sure, anxiety,

14:13.787 --> 14:17.021
punched, kicked,

14:17.023 --> 14:20.525
possible sexual assaults...

14:23.830 --> 14:26.731
Very weird.
It's weird.

14:36.643 --> 14:37.642
How old are you, honey?

14:37.644 --> 14:39.410
I'm 11.
Okay.

14:39.412 --> 14:42.881
So when I talked to mom, um,
she called us in basically

14:42.883 --> 14:44.382
because the stuff
you're going through.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.450
Yeah.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.518
Is that upsetting you?
Yeah.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.121
So I understand you've been
having some experiences.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.256
Yeah.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.724
Okay, can you mind
telling me about them?

14:52.726 --> 14:55.627
Um, I went upstairs.

14:55.629 --> 14:59.697
And I heard my door close,

14:59.699 --> 15:01.699
and then open
and then close.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.935
And it went on and on and on.

15:03.937 --> 15:06.971
Which door is this?
It was that door.

15:06.973 --> 15:08.506
Okay, did you see it open
and closing?

15:08.508 --> 15:09.941
Yes.

15:09.943 --> 15:12.043
Yes, but could the window
have been open in the bedroom

15:12.045 --> 15:13.544
that caused the door
to open and shut?

15:13.546 --> 15:15.013
My dad came in
and checked it out

15:15.015 --> 15:16.814
and there was nothing in here.
Nothing here.

15:16.816 --> 15:18.416
Okay, have you seen
or heard anything else?

15:18.418 --> 15:23.821
My dresser and my TV
they were both rocking.

15:23.823 --> 15:26.891
The dresser started going
up and down?

15:26.893 --> 15:28.359
No, it started like...

15:28.361 --> 15:29.394
Teetering back and forth?

15:29.396 --> 15:31.262
Yeah.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.463
The whole dresser itself?

15:32.465 --> 15:33.698
Yeah.

15:33.700 --> 15:34.933
Did you guys think
you were having a earthquake

15:34.935 --> 15:36.334
or something?

15:36.336 --> 15:40.004
No, because I didn't see
anything else shaking and...

15:40.006 --> 15:41.039
So it was
just these two things?

15:41.041 --> 15:43.074
It was just those two things.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.742
All right.
So anything else, honey?

15:44.744 --> 15:50.682
I got scratched
right over here.

15:50.684 --> 15:52.583
I was laying in my bed

15:52.585 --> 15:55.586
and my arm was
hanging out like that.

15:55.588 --> 15:58.957
And then there was, like,
a little... like that.

15:58.959 --> 16:02.260
So this is a silly question
but are you scared to be here?

16:02.262 --> 16:05.797
I'm really scared to be here.

16:05.799 --> 16:08.433
Okay.

16:08.435 --> 16:11.169
I'm seeing, like,
a teenage girl.

16:11.171 --> 16:13.271
Everybody's being affected.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.306
But it's almost like --
like she's really getting,

16:15.308 --> 16:17.642
like, the brunt.

16:17.644 --> 16:21.346
You know what I mean?
Like, she's, like, ground zero.

16:21.348 --> 16:24.916
She has a lot of ability.

16:24.918 --> 16:27.852
She might be,

16:27.854 --> 16:33.891
the biggest source

16:33.893 --> 16:37.195
and doesn't even know it,
doesn't even know it.

16:42.068 --> 16:44.202
So what do you think
would happen,

16:44.204 --> 16:46.304
if this were to con --
continue going on

16:46.306 --> 16:48.373
and nothing
was done about it?

16:48.375 --> 16:51.676
I think
that the physical attacks

16:51.678 --> 16:55.813
would become more violent,

16:55.815 --> 16:57.615
to where there would be,

16:57.617 --> 17:00.084
um, actual cutting

17:00.086 --> 17:03.087
or scratching involved.

17:03.089 --> 17:05.390
And, possible smothering

17:05.392 --> 17:07.925
or strangulation to occur.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.142
Other than a family
living in fear,

17:24.144 --> 17:27.178
I don't have much to go
off of to do my investigation.

17:27.180 --> 17:31.482
So I'm at the library to see
if I can dig anything up.

17:31.484 --> 17:32.817
Searching through old records,

17:32.819 --> 17:34.385
I find one of
the original owners

17:34.387 --> 17:37.722
of my clients property
lost two young kids.

17:37.724 --> 17:42.593
Turns out they both drowned
in an accident.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.929
I'm on my way
to meet with a local genealogist

17:44.931 --> 17:47.165
who's looking into
this tragedy for me.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.033
She tells me the kids
who drowned that day

17:49.035 --> 17:52.236
were direct descendants
of a very prominent local man.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.644
So, Christine,
before we get to the drownings

17:59.646 --> 18:02.713
you mentioned that the kids
were related to somebody famous.

18:02.715 --> 18:05.783
Yes, the children's grandfather
was Edward Watkins Clark.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.919
One of the first
Mormon settlers here in Utah.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.720
Okay.
When did this guy come here?

18:09.722 --> 18:11.889
So, in 1852 he finally
settled in Utah

18:11.891 --> 18:12.990
with his first wife.

18:12.992 --> 18:14.225
All right.
So when Edward gets here

18:14.227 --> 18:15.993
what does he do?
He was a farmer.

18:15.995 --> 18:17.862
He was very prominent
in the community.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.697
Everyone knew him
and his wife, Lucy.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.399
He was actually elected

18:21.401 --> 18:23.501
to justice of the peace
out in Santaquin.

18:23.503 --> 18:24.569
Okay, you said
his first wife.

18:24.571 --> 18:26.370
Can I assume his first
wife died?

18:26.372 --> 18:27.638
No, actually the Mormon church

18:27.640 --> 18:29.974
encouraged polygamy
at this time.

18:29.976 --> 18:32.009
And so he was encouraged
to take other wives.

18:32.011 --> 18:34.879
And in 1857 he married
his second wife, Louisa Miller,

18:34.881 --> 18:36.180
who was 20 years his junior.

18:36.182 --> 18:38.216
She was only 17
when they got married.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.417
Seventeen?

18:39.419 --> 18:41.953
I have a picture
of her when she's older.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.521
Now does he have kids
with both of them?

18:43.523 --> 18:45.389
Yes, 18.
Wow.

18:45.391 --> 18:46.824
He had 10
with his first wife, Lucy,

18:46.826 --> 18:49.060
and eight with
his second wife, Louisa.

18:49.062 --> 18:50.628
The second youngest
is John Edward,

18:50.630 --> 18:52.563
who is the father
of the children who died.

18:52.565 --> 18:55.099
Okay.

18:55.101 --> 18:56.367
I'm seeing this woman

18:56.369 --> 19:01.072
and she's married
to a much older male.

19:01.074 --> 19:04.642
She was probably
in her late 20s

19:04.644 --> 19:06.911
and he was, like,

19:06.913 --> 19:09.180
between 60
and 70 years of age.

19:09.182 --> 19:12.250
He was prestigious.

19:12.252 --> 19:15.586
He was a big time business man.

19:15.588 --> 19:18.689
He kept fighting me
because he doesn't want me here.

19:18.691 --> 19:23.561
He doesn't want anything
about him or his family out.

19:25.331 --> 19:30.701
He wants to keep
his private life secret.

19:30.703 --> 19:33.671
And then there's a --

19:33.673 --> 19:35.706
a -- a younger female.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.342
And I don't know
if it's his step-daughter

19:38.344 --> 19:43.648
or if it's
his biological daughter.

19:43.650 --> 19:49.854
The girl doesn't look
like either one of them at all.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.990
The daughter is like 16
or something.

19:52.992 --> 19:57.061
Um, and he was having
an inappropriate relationship

19:57.063 --> 19:58.396
with her

19:58.398 --> 20:01.899
and also very abusive
and controlling.

20:01.901 --> 20:05.636
I guess you would wanna
keep that quiet.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.271
So I know
Edward's son, John,

20:07.273 --> 20:08.773
owned my clients' property
at one point.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.341
Do you know when that was?

20:10.343 --> 20:13.211
1923 is when he bought
the property out in Magna.

20:13.213 --> 20:16.247
Okay, so now
how many kids did he have?

20:16.249 --> 20:17.582
He had eight children
in total.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.850
He had three girls
and five little boys.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.552
Okay, so take me through
the day of the accident.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.789
What happened?
Ä°t was January 2, 1926.

20:24.791 --> 20:27.258
It was a day a lot like today
where the sun is out

20:27.260 --> 20:28.859
and all the snow
is on the ground

20:28.861 --> 20:31.495
and the pond probably looked
a lot like this, very frozen.

20:31.497 --> 20:33.598
Three of the little boys,
Floydd,

20:33.600 --> 20:36.801
Morris and Lennis, all
take their friend Clarence out.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.136
And they were chasing geese
across the pond

20:39.138 --> 20:41.272
but it was too thin
and all the boys fell through.

20:41.274 --> 20:42.573
Wow.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.976
And Clarence was able
to help Floydd out of the water

20:44.978 --> 20:47.678
but Morris and Lennis
ended up drowning.

20:47.680 --> 20:48.946
I have their death certificates.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.983
So this is Morris Ruden,

20:51.985 --> 20:53.217
and his death certificate
even says,

20:53.219 --> 20:55.820
"Accidental drowning."
Okay.

20:55.822 --> 20:59.023
And then Lennis Dean,
same thing.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.424
All right, so they lost
two kids to drowning.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.927
Tragic. I mean, I can't even
imagine losing one

21:02.929 --> 21:04.328
let alone two.
Yeah.

21:04.330 --> 21:05.863
So what happened with --
with John?

21:05.865 --> 21:07.431
I mean, did him
and his wife stick around

21:07.433 --> 21:08.733
after this happened?
They did.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.434
John actually did not release
the property

21:10.436 --> 21:13.170
until 1953 is
when he sold it actually

21:13.172 --> 21:16.741
a few months before he died,
when his heart collapsed.

21:16.743 --> 21:19.076
Okay.

21:19.078 --> 21:23.180
I do see a different house,
that was here prior.

21:23.182 --> 21:28.286
This house took up
several acres of property.

21:28.288 --> 21:33.924
I'm hearing a woman
screaming and crying.

21:33.926 --> 21:37.495
And it's over a death.

21:37.497 --> 21:39.230
She's outside.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.771
It might be in the backyard
or something.

21:46.773 --> 21:51.609
This person
couldn't get over it.

21:51.611 --> 21:52.877
Can't --

21:52.879 --> 21:56.013
can't get over it.

21:56.015 --> 21:57.248
She's like, "Why?

21:57.250 --> 21:59.016
Why?"

22:01.054 --> 22:02.920
Very dramatic.

22:02.922 --> 22:05.189
Like, her hands
are up, like, "Why?

22:05.191 --> 22:09.994
Why? Why?
No, no, no."

22:23.910 --> 22:25.209
Jennie told me
she thought there used

22:25.211 --> 22:27.311
to be a lot
of copper mining in the area.

22:27.313 --> 22:30.181
So I made some calls
and it turns out she's right.

22:30.183 --> 22:33.050
I'm meeting a historian
who says mining killed two men

22:33.052 --> 22:35.019
who live on my clients' land.

22:41.694 --> 22:44.161
So, Robert, what can you tell me
about the mining industry

22:44.163 --> 22:45.429
in Magna?

22:45.431 --> 22:47.531
Well Magna actually started out
as a farming community.

22:47.533 --> 22:50.000
Okay.
But it wasn't until 1906

22:50.002 --> 22:52.203
that the Utah Copper Company
brought in the --

22:52.205 --> 22:54.672
the biggest, refining

22:54.674 --> 22:58.609
and smelting, operation
in world history at the time.

22:58.611 --> 23:02.480
Millions of tons of ore
was being processed every year.

23:02.482 --> 23:03.914
So it's basically all copper?

23:03.916 --> 23:05.883
Mostly copper, that's
what they're renowned for.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.718
You can talk about a real
dangerous work environment.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.588
It was very dangerous,
very toxic environment.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.690
Okay.
A lot of sulfuric emissions,

23:12.692 --> 23:14.825
heavy metal particulates
and even asbestos.

23:14.827 --> 23:17.128
So the odds are stacked
against you.

23:17.130 --> 23:19.363
So you had mentioned
on the phone, two guys

23:19.365 --> 23:20.831
that lived
on my clients' property,

23:20.833 --> 23:23.300
died in connection
with the mining.

23:23.302 --> 23:24.702
Tell me about the first guy.

23:24.704 --> 23:26.537
First guys name
is Wallace Anderson.

23:26.539 --> 23:28.472
Okay.
He bought your clients' property

23:28.474 --> 23:29.974
in 1936.

23:29.976 --> 23:31.075
So what happened to him?

23:31.077 --> 23:34.044
Well, by 1944 it catches up
to him.

23:34.046 --> 23:35.746
He's in your clients' house.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.381
He's feeling pain in his lungs.

23:37.383 --> 23:38.582
He's having trouble breathing.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.484
He checks himself
into the hospital.

23:40.486 --> 23:41.886
He's there for 12 days.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.287
And he dies.

23:43.289 --> 23:45.322
Okay, so what's
the official cause of death?

23:45.324 --> 23:47.324
It's bronchogenic carcinoma.

23:47.326 --> 23:50.928
It's lung cancer.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.631
Pretty common way to go
for mine workers back then.

23:53.633 --> 23:54.899
It was.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.000
Now, Robert, you mentioned
there was a second guy

23:56.002 --> 23:57.835
that died
on my clients' property.

23:57.837 --> 23:59.003
Right.
Who, who was that?

23:59.005 --> 24:02.206
His name was
Paul William Confer.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.175
He was actually
renting the property

24:04.177 --> 24:05.943
from Wallace's widow.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.511
Okay, so what happened?

24:07.513 --> 24:09.246
In 1948, he goes down

24:09.248 --> 24:11.482
inside the mine
in a blasting team

24:11.484 --> 24:13.117
with another fella...
Okay.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.052
And they never came out
with the other groups.

24:15.054 --> 24:16.554
And so they sent
a search party down there

24:16.556 --> 24:18.122
and discovered
that they'd been killed.

24:18.124 --> 24:19.490
They were killed
in an explosion.

24:19.492 --> 24:21.625
And here's his death
certificate.

24:21.627 --> 24:23.694
Subtotal decapitation,

24:23.696 --> 24:26.831
amputation both arms,
puncture wounds both legs.

24:26.833 --> 24:29.266
Did they ever figure out
what caused the explosion?

24:29.268 --> 24:32.169
Either a faulty fuse...
Okay.

24:32.171 --> 24:34.371
Or it was negligence
on the part of the miners.

24:34.373 --> 24:37.007
Geez.
Are the mines still going on?

24:37.009 --> 24:39.109
Yeah. The mine is still
running today.

24:39.111 --> 24:41.245
So I'm assuming it's a cleaner
operation today?

24:41.247 --> 24:43.047
It is.
In 1994 the EPA

24:43.049 --> 24:46.951
stepped in and declared Magna
an environmental disaster zone.

24:46.953 --> 24:49.854
After 100 years of industry,

24:49.856 --> 24:51.689
the water was contaminated.

24:51.691 --> 24:53.457
The soil was contaminated.

24:53.459 --> 24:55.326
What kinds of effects
could that have on somebody?

24:55.328 --> 24:57.561
Today still the lung cancer rate

24:57.563 --> 25:00.030
is 50 percent greater
than the rest of the state.

25:00.032 --> 25:02.399
And not only cancer
but high rates

25:02.401 --> 25:04.869
of ADD, autism, delirium

25:04.871 --> 25:06.837
and even hallucinations.

25:06.839 --> 25:09.707
Really?
That's interesting.

25:13.045 --> 25:16.380
There's a lot
of residual energy here.

25:16.382 --> 25:18.949
I saw on the land

25:18.951 --> 25:22.720
that everything
was built on blood.

25:22.722 --> 25:25.923
And I see the blood
is still flowing.

25:27.994 --> 25:32.296
And they said it was built
and blood and dirty dealings

25:32.298 --> 25:37.234
and that both of those things
are still happening today.

25:37.236 --> 25:39.870
And that's why the blood
is still flowing.

25:42.241 --> 25:44.241
This is a not good place.

25:50.616 --> 25:53.484
Look, if contaminated water
can cause hallucinations

25:53.486 --> 25:55.753
it could explain some
of the really strange things

25:55.755 --> 25:57.755
Jennie and her family
are seeing.

25:57.757 --> 25:59.623
I'm heading back to the house
to meet an inspector

25:59.625 --> 26:03.327
who's going to give the water
a thorough, scientific test.

26:10.570 --> 26:11.835
Hey, Jonathan.
How's it goin'?

26:11.837 --> 26:13.170
Thanks for coming by.
I appreciate it.

26:13.172 --> 26:14.338
Yeah.
You bet.

26:14.340 --> 26:15.806
The reason I called you out
is my clients

26:15.808 --> 26:18.208
that live in this house,
they're telling me

26:18.210 --> 26:20.044
that they're seeing some
really off the wall,

26:20.046 --> 26:21.312
bizarre stuff.

26:21.314 --> 26:23.080
Now I know this place
in '94 was considered

26:23.082 --> 26:25.449
a EPA disaster area.
That's correct.

26:25.451 --> 26:27.084
I mean,
all along the Wasatch Front

26:27.086 --> 26:29.019
we see a number of locations

26:29.021 --> 26:32.156
that have had some kind
of environmental hazards,

26:32.158 --> 26:35.092
primarily due to the proximity
of local mines in the area.

26:35.094 --> 26:36.293
Now, could you test to see

26:36.295 --> 26:38.462
if there's any kind
of environmental problem

26:38.464 --> 26:40.464
that could cause these people
to have hallucinations?

26:40.466 --> 26:41.565
Yeah.
Absolutely.

26:41.567 --> 26:43.434
Okay, good.
Let me know what you find.

26:43.436 --> 26:45.202
Will do.

26:47.873 --> 26:50.674
I've clients seeing things
moving on their own

26:50.676 --> 26:53.110
and green men
coming out of the walls

26:53.112 --> 26:55.412
which means there are
three possibilities.

26:55.414 --> 26:56.747
One, they're lying to me.

26:56.749 --> 26:59.183
But I don't think
that's the case.

26:59.185 --> 27:00.451
Two, their soil

27:00.453 --> 27:03.387
or water is contaminated
causing them to hallucinate.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.889
Or three, there's something
going on that only Amy

27:05.891 --> 27:06.890
can understand.

27:06.892 --> 27:08.692
So, how'd it go?

27:08.694 --> 27:10.260
Well we tested the soil,

27:10.262 --> 27:12.329
the water as well
as the paint on the walls

27:12.331 --> 27:14.064
and we didn't find
any contaminants.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.132
Really?

27:15.134 --> 27:16.533
So there's
no environmental reason

27:16.535 --> 27:18.202
why clients are seeing
what the hell they're seeing?

27:18.204 --> 27:20.371
No.
Okay.

27:20.373 --> 27:22.139
So now I know what it's not.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.816
I saw a lot
of disturbing activity

27:32.818 --> 27:33.951
during my walk.

27:33.953 --> 27:36.020
But the drug addict
who projects himself

27:36.022 --> 27:38.689
as the shadow figure
really stood out.

27:38.691 --> 27:39.723
He was young,

27:39.725 --> 27:43.761
I would say between 18 and 24.

27:43.763 --> 27:48.532
He had a very narrow, nose.

27:48.534 --> 27:52.403
He also had very dark eyes,
kinda black.

27:59.612 --> 28:02.179
Is this who you saw?

28:02.181 --> 28:03.614
Yes.

28:23.869 --> 28:26.770
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

28:26.772 --> 28:27.905
we're ready
to reveal our findings

28:27.907 --> 28:29.840
to each other and our clients

28:29.842 --> 28:31.842
for the first time.

28:31.844 --> 28:34.378
So, Amy, I want you to meet
Randall and Jennie.

28:34.380 --> 28:37.481
They're experiencing some pretty
bizarre stuff in their house.

28:37.483 --> 28:40.451
But the reason they called us in
is because of their kids.

28:40.453 --> 28:43.654
We got a photo
of the family here.

28:43.656 --> 28:45.723
Now, this is Lexie, she's 11.

28:45.725 --> 28:48.826
This is Summer,
she's an adorable 7-year-old.

28:48.828 --> 28:51.428
This is their Zeke, who's 12.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.831
And this is,
Jennie's mom, Debbie,

28:53.833 --> 28:55.032
who lives with them.

28:55.034 --> 28:56.700
These guys think
that whatever's in the house

28:56.702 --> 28:58.202
is going after the kids.

28:58.204 --> 28:59.436
And they promised me they'll do

28:59.438 --> 29:01.371
whatever it takes
to keep them safe.

29:01.373 --> 29:03.707
So now that Amy knows
a little bit about your family,

29:03.709 --> 29:06.376
I'm going to, ask her
to describe her walk.

29:09.248 --> 29:12.983
Walking up to your home,
to the front door,

29:12.985 --> 29:15.786
I saw a male,

29:15.788 --> 29:18.822
doing some kind of ritual

29:18.824 --> 29:21.458
or protection.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.594
Who ever this was,

29:23.596 --> 29:27.097
and whatever he did,
was not good.

29:27.099 --> 29:31.769
It created a type
of negative suction

29:31.771 --> 29:33.337
into your house.

29:33.339 --> 29:35.405
And unfortunately
all good energy

29:35.407 --> 29:38.509
stops right at your front door.

29:38.511 --> 29:40.310
That's weird because I don't
know about a male,

29:40.312 --> 29:43.480
but you mentioned to me
that you guys did something.

29:43.482 --> 29:45.549
Yeah.
Me and my mother-in-law,

29:45.551 --> 29:46.884
we tried to cleanse the house

29:46.886 --> 29:49.820
with, like,
sage and salt.

29:49.822 --> 29:51.088
Now she's talking
about negativity.

29:51.090 --> 29:52.689
Have you guys felt that
in the house?

29:52.691 --> 29:54.358
Sometimes when you just
come home it just --

29:54.360 --> 29:56.927
just doesn't feel right.
It doesn't feel like home.

29:56.929 --> 30:00.364
Wow.

30:00.366 --> 30:02.499
So what else did you see?

30:02.501 --> 30:06.336
I encountered an elderly
deceased male.

30:06.338 --> 30:09.173
What he was saying to me was
that when he was alive

30:09.175 --> 30:11.308
he was very prestigious.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.510
He was a big player.

30:13.512 --> 30:16.246
He absolutely did not
want me there.

30:16.248 --> 30:20.184
What I did get was
that there were two women,

30:20.186 --> 30:21.785
of importance in his life.

30:21.787 --> 30:24.221
One was his wife.

30:24.223 --> 30:28.192
The wife was much younger
than him.

30:28.194 --> 30:29.827
She was in her twenties.

30:29.829 --> 30:32.396
And then one was a younger girl.

30:32.398 --> 30:35.399
And I didn't know if that was
his daughter or step-daughter.

30:35.401 --> 30:37.968
And the girl was about 16.

30:37.970 --> 30:40.137
And what I did get

30:40.139 --> 30:42.973
was that there was
an inappropriate relationship

30:42.975 --> 30:45.742
between him
and the younger girl.

30:45.744 --> 30:50.247
And I felt like that's
what he was trying to conceal.

30:50.249 --> 30:53.183
He's very grouchy,
very controlling.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.953
And when he is
inside of the home

30:55.955 --> 31:01.225
the men of the house may take on
these kinds of attitudes.

31:01.227 --> 31:03.727
Well, Jennie, have you noticed
that with Randall or Zeke?

31:03.729 --> 31:05.963
Yeah.
Big time.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.698
I came across somebody
in my research

31:07.700 --> 31:08.732
that might fit the bill.

31:08.734 --> 31:11.235
His name was
Edward Watkins Clark.

31:11.237 --> 31:12.970
You had mentioned
he was prestigious.

31:12.972 --> 31:16.306
He was a famous pioneer
for the Mormon church.

31:16.308 --> 31:19.176
He came over
from England in 1852.

31:19.178 --> 31:21.879
He brought his wife Lucy
over with his kids.

31:21.881 --> 31:23.113
Now you mentioned a teenage girl

31:23.115 --> 31:25.482
that might be his daughter
or a step-daughter.

31:25.484 --> 31:29.987
Well back in those days
they preached polygamy.

31:29.989 --> 31:31.688
He was 37.

31:31.690 --> 31:32.856
And he married his girl, Louisa,

31:32.858 --> 31:36.526
who was,
17 at the time.

31:36.528 --> 31:38.028
Now I got a photo of her

31:38.030 --> 31:43.500
but this is from
when she was much older.

31:43.502 --> 31:46.003
Now together with his two wives
he had 18 kids.

31:46.005 --> 31:48.639
The 17th child,

31:48.641 --> 31:51.575
named John, ended up
living on your property.

31:54.513 --> 31:58.815
The next thing
that I saw is a younger male.

31:58.817 --> 32:03.086
And I honestly couldn't tell
if he was alive or dead.

32:03.088 --> 32:06.523
If he is deceased
it was extremely recent.

32:06.525 --> 32:08.458
He was in the downstairs,

32:08.460 --> 32:11.128
large, downstairs bedroom.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.163
He was very agitated.

32:13.165 --> 32:15.933
He felt like everybody
was out to get him.

32:15.935 --> 32:18.101
He felt like he was
falling apart.

32:18.103 --> 32:21.004
The living,
who would be down there a lot,

32:21.006 --> 32:24.975
would feel this sense
of despair or depression.

32:24.977 --> 32:27.911
And I think
if you were to see him

32:27.913 --> 32:30.113
it would be
a shadow-like figure.

32:30.115 --> 32:32.516
Now, Jennie, you had your own
experiences with shadow figures?

32:32.518 --> 32:34.952
Yeah.
Tell her what you told me.

32:34.954 --> 32:37.854
And I'll just be right there,
by my dresser,

32:37.856 --> 32:39.423
and then he'll come towards me.

32:39.425 --> 32:41.892
But then I'm stuck in my bed.
And I'm just frozen.

32:41.894 --> 32:46.830
I'm sweating, breathing hard,
just can't do anything.

32:46.832 --> 32:48.799
Randall, didn't you see
another one leering at you

32:48.801 --> 32:50.367
at one point?

32:50.369 --> 32:52.836
I asked him, "Who are you?
What do you want?"

32:52.838 --> 32:54.638
It just looked at me...

32:54.640 --> 32:57.507
Then gone, just vanished.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.843
Did you get anything
about this guy in life?

32:59.845 --> 33:03.747
What I got on him was
that he was, I think,

33:03.749 --> 33:05.015
in his twenties.

33:05.017 --> 33:07.584
He claimed to have done a lot
of terrible things

33:07.586 --> 33:09.186
during his lifetime.

33:09.188 --> 33:13.957
I just see him with a rifle
and a small handgun.

33:13.959 --> 33:16.693
And I did get
that he was an addict

33:16.695 --> 33:19.196
and/or fighting addiction.

33:19.198 --> 33:21.531
I got a sense
that he did live here.

33:21.533 --> 33:24.468
And like I said,
if he still alive,

33:24.470 --> 33:27.938
he essentially left
part of himself.

33:27.940 --> 33:29.740
Did you get a good look at him?

33:29.742 --> 33:32.275
- I had a sketch done.
- Okay.

33:41.220 --> 33:42.586
Maybe you guys can tell me
if they --

33:42.588 --> 33:45.355
he looks like anybody
that you might know.

33:49.561 --> 33:53.497
My brother.
Yeah.

33:53.499 --> 33:56.299
My brother's sittin'
in jail right now.

33:56.301 --> 33:57.768
What?

33:57.770 --> 33:59.770
Any issues with guns and stuff
that she's talking about?

33:59.772 --> 34:03.473
Yeah.
He -- he loves guns.

34:03.475 --> 34:05.142
This is pretty wild.

34:05.144 --> 34:06.476
So let me get this straight,

34:06.478 --> 34:08.145
it's possible for somebody

34:08.147 --> 34:11.348
who's not dead
to haunt the house?

34:11.350 --> 34:14.751
Sometimes people will
really leave a, like,

34:14.753 --> 34:18.021
really a part
of themselves there.

34:18.023 --> 34:20.489
This has gotta be tough
for you to hear though?

34:20.492 --> 34:22.259
Yeah.
Very.

34:25.364 --> 34:27.597
So what else?

34:27.599 --> 34:29.699
I went into the pink room.

34:29.701 --> 34:32.735
And I got a horrible headache.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.438
It was overwhelming.

34:34.440 --> 34:38.208
And I felt like a woman
stays there, goes there,

34:38.210 --> 34:39.876
feels like the room
is a safe haven

34:39.878 --> 34:41.178
to get away from everything.

34:41.179 --> 34:43.013
But it's not.

34:43.014 --> 34:47.984
And she keeps feeling pain
from life loss.

34:47.985 --> 34:50.387
I got loss, abuse and death.

34:50.389 --> 34:52.389
When she's in there, it just

34:52.391 --> 34:56.359
feels like it's all happening
again and again.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.695
Well that's the room
where Jennie's mom,

34:58.697 --> 35:00.197
Debbie, sleeps.

35:00.199 --> 35:03.333
Um, my mom has had
a couple brain surgeries.

35:03.335 --> 35:04.568
Wow.

35:04.570 --> 35:07.637
And the last one
was a stage two cancer.

35:07.639 --> 35:09.606
So she does get headaches a lot.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.374
So what she's saying kinda
makes sense?

35:11.376 --> 35:12.476
Yeah.

35:12.478 --> 35:15.712
She's been through a lot.

35:15.714 --> 35:18.548
Now'd you see
anything else?

35:18.550 --> 35:20.417
So the thing I'm most
concerned about

35:20.419 --> 35:24.721
is the poltergeist activity
in the house.

35:24.723 --> 35:28.959
A poltergeist is usually created

35:28.961 --> 35:31.628
by one living agent
who has abilities.

35:31.630 --> 35:34.564
But in your case it's unusual

35:34.566 --> 35:38.768
because you have several people
in your home with abilities.

35:38.770 --> 35:40.804
And they're all feeding
this poltergeist

35:40.806 --> 35:42.339
without even knowing it.

35:44.643 --> 35:48.078
And what can happen

35:48.080 --> 35:52.616
is that when you get upset
with somebody,

35:52.618 --> 35:55.118
the poltergeist
will affect that person.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.419
So, suddenly,
that person will feel

35:56.421 --> 35:58.188
like they're being smacked,

35:58.190 --> 35:59.589
pinched, punched,

35:59.591 --> 36:01.825
kicked, scratches will appear,

36:01.827 --> 36:03.927
things like that happen.

36:03.929 --> 36:06.396
Also, you'll see strange things.

36:06.398 --> 36:10.767
It's a result of
this poltergeist manifestation

36:10.769 --> 36:14.804
from somebody
in the house.

36:14.806 --> 36:16.940
Now, she hit on a lot of things
you guys are experiencing.

36:16.942 --> 36:18.375
Lexie with the scratch.

36:18.377 --> 36:20.177
Tell Amy what happened.

36:20.179 --> 36:22.479
We were all getting ready
to leave, you know,

36:22.481 --> 36:24.414
and she's walking down the hall

36:24.416 --> 36:27.517
and all of a sudden
she's just scratched.

36:27.519 --> 36:31.555
Tell her about, pretty wild,
there's the door.

36:31.557 --> 36:35.025
Lexie was going
into the kitchen to get food.

36:35.027 --> 36:36.393
And she was
almost to the kitchen

36:36.395 --> 36:38.228
but her bedroom door was sitting
there opening and closing,

36:38.230 --> 36:40.397
like, fully opening and closing.

36:40.399 --> 36:43.099
You were saying people
might see strange things?

36:43.101 --> 36:45.468
Now get this,
their son Zeke

36:45.470 --> 36:47.604
was telling me some crazy stuff.

36:47.606 --> 36:50.307
I mean, green men
coming outta the walls...

36:50.309 --> 36:51.341
Yeah.

36:51.343 --> 36:52.776
Yeah.

36:52.778 --> 36:55.045
Could all this activity
be from the poltergeist?

36:55.047 --> 36:58.682
Yes, absolutely.

36:58.684 --> 37:00.016
All right. Now, there's
something you gotta know

37:00.018 --> 37:01.518
about the area
that they live in.

37:01.520 --> 37:04.387
It's basically built
on a copper mining business.

37:04.389 --> 37:06.122
1994 the EPA came in

37:06.124 --> 37:09.759
and declared the area
an environmental disaster zone.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.795
What?
Now some of the toxins

37:11.797 --> 37:13.463
in the water
can cause hallucinations.

37:13.465 --> 37:15.932
So I had everything
checked in your house.

37:15.934 --> 37:18.935
I had the soil,
the water and paint.

37:18.937 --> 37:21.438
Everything came back negative.

37:21.440 --> 37:24.641
Yeah. I think the kids
are creating the strange visions

37:24.643 --> 37:26.176
to scare each other.

37:26.178 --> 37:27.744
They're torturing
each other.

37:30.315 --> 37:31.781
Do they know they're doing
that to each other?

37:31.783 --> 37:34.150
No, I don't think they do.

37:34.152 --> 37:35.752
But it's
subconsciously they're doing it?

37:35.754 --> 37:37.887
Yes,

37:37.889 --> 37:41.191
The strongest agent
in the house,

37:41.193 --> 37:42.892
of this ability

37:42.894 --> 37:45.028
is Lexie.

37:45.030 --> 37:46.396
Wow.

37:46.398 --> 37:48.698
I -- I don't know --
I don't know what to say.

37:48.700 --> 37:50.300
I knew she was going
through a lot

37:50.302 --> 37:54.271
but I didn't know
it was like that.

37:54.273 --> 37:56.306
If this goes unchecked
what happens?

37:56.308 --> 37:58.642
It'll get
more and more active,

37:58.644 --> 38:03.013
especially when she starts
to go through puberty.

38:03.015 --> 38:06.349
That's when, like, things
can really get crazy.

38:06.351 --> 38:07.550
I never in a million years

38:07.552 --> 38:09.786
would have thought
that that would be it.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.388
How violent could it get?

38:11.390 --> 38:12.656
There was one case

38:12.658 --> 38:15.725
I did where a woman
had over 300 stitches.

38:15.727 --> 38:18.528
Couches I've seen
go flying across rooms,

38:18.530 --> 38:20.730
people being dragged,

38:20.732 --> 38:22.899
through the house by their hair.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.167
So this could happen here,
potentially?

38:24.169 --> 38:26.736
Yes, potentially.
Yeah.

38:26.738 --> 38:28.838
It can get pretty intense.

38:45.324 --> 38:46.890
So you guys called us in

38:46.892 --> 38:48.458
because you knew
you had a problem.

38:48.460 --> 38:52.462
But I'm sure you never
imagined in a million years

38:52.464 --> 38:55.398
that you guys were
haunting each other.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.701
To find out
how to fix it and stop it,

38:57.703 --> 38:59.202
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:02.641 --> 39:07.544
What I would like to see
happen is for a psychic

39:07.546 --> 39:12.182
to come in to do
the initial cleansing.

39:12.184 --> 39:16.686
And that person is going
to teach you how to do it.

39:16.688 --> 39:17.987
This is one of things

39:17.989 --> 39:20.990
that you and your children

39:20.992 --> 39:24.894
are going to need to do
for the rest of your lives.

39:24.896 --> 39:29.833
Over time, it'll remove
residual energy and impressions.

39:29.835 --> 39:32.902
So it'll be a lot quieter,
a lot more peaceful.

39:32.904 --> 39:36.339
Everybody will feel very chill.

39:36.341 --> 39:39.309
I'm curious about one thing,
the protection that went wrong.

39:39.311 --> 39:41.678
Will these cleansings
help reverse that?

39:41.680 --> 39:45.749
Yes, doing
the monthly cleansings

39:45.751 --> 39:50.220
will take care of a lot
of the bigger issues.

39:50.222 --> 39:53.490
The second thing I would like
to see happen would be

39:53.492 --> 39:57.560
for the psychic to remove
the deceased people.

39:57.562 --> 40:00.430
That would be
the older gentleman,

40:00.432 --> 40:03.066
his main wife

40:03.068 --> 40:05.068
and the second wife,

40:05.070 --> 40:08.738
who is the teenager.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.306
The third thing,

40:10.308 --> 40:12.008
this is again something

40:12.010 --> 40:13.943
that the family
will need to do together

40:13.945 --> 40:16.012
and need to keep it up.

40:16.014 --> 40:19.349
One is hatha yoga,
and then tai chi.

40:19.351 --> 40:21.584
So that'll decrease
the poltergeist activity?

40:21.586 --> 40:22.952
Yes, immensely.

40:22.954 --> 40:24.721
Saw that look on your face

40:24.723 --> 40:26.856
when you started talking
about yoga and tai chi.

40:26.858 --> 40:29.692
I -- I -- I enjoy everything.

40:29.694 --> 40:31.928
Don't matter to me.
Let's have fun.

40:31.930 --> 40:34.364
- Okay.
- The other thing

40:34.366 --> 40:36.933
that I would like
to see happen

40:36.935 --> 40:38.435
is for Lexie

40:38.437 --> 40:42.038
to maybe see a child
psychotherapist

40:42.040 --> 40:44.507
for her to learn

40:44.509 --> 40:46.276
how to open up
a little bit more,

40:46.278 --> 40:47.710
how to communicate

40:47.712 --> 40:49.746
about her emotions
a little bit more,

40:49.748 --> 40:53.416
which will help her learn
to kind of ground out

40:53.418 --> 40:55.685
and control her energy.

40:55.687 --> 40:58.421
I think that would be
really good for her.

40:58.423 --> 41:01.057
So, Jennie, this is gonna
be a life long thing.

41:01.059 --> 41:02.759
You up for that?

41:02.761 --> 41:05.195
I mean, it'll probably
get us closer and hopefully

41:05.197 --> 41:06.596
get her to open up.

41:06.598 --> 41:08.731
Is this something you guys
are definitely gonna wanna...

41:08.733 --> 41:09.833
Look into and do?
Yes.

41:09.835 --> 41:12.335
Yes.
Definitely.

41:12.337 --> 41:15.071
I have an answer and you're
turning a negative

41:15.073 --> 41:16.773
into a positive...
Right.

41:16.775 --> 41:19.075
For the family, for the house,

41:19.077 --> 41:21.978
for everybody.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.913
Jennie and Randall
have a lot of work

41:23.915 --> 41:26.449
to do if they want to rid
their home of the dead

41:26.451 --> 41:28.384
and the poltergeist
that they're feeding.

41:28.386 --> 41:31.187
But with the help of a psychic
and a therapist,

41:31.189 --> 41:32.689
they can work as a family

41:32.691 --> 41:36.025
to free themselves of the evil
that's been tearing them apart.
