00:02.313 --> 00:03.629
Carter.

00:03.714 --> 00:05.381
Carter, honey, can you hear me?

00:06.551 --> 00:07.884
- Carter?
- Lori?

00:09.220 --> 00:11.853
Oh... thank God.

00:11.890 --> 00:14.807
What happened? What are you doing here?

00:17.228 --> 00:18.728
Take it easy, go slow.

00:18.812 --> 00:20.146
There you go.

00:20.231 --> 00:22.147
Oh, my head is pounding.

00:22.233 --> 00:23.533
I know, sweetie.

00:23.568 --> 00:26.285
You hit it really hard.

00:36.079 --> 00:37.162
What happened?

00:37.247 --> 00:39.048
There was an accident.

00:39.082 --> 00:40.665
I'm sorry, honey.

00:41.886 --> 00:43.301
He's dead.

00:47.142 --> 00:48.975
Tell me the last thing you remember.

00:49.060 --> 00:50.759
Um...

00:50.844 --> 00:53.762
- Um, we were fighting.
- Uh-huh.

00:53.847 --> 00:56.481
I was upset about Ben.

00:56.567 --> 00:58.100
Did I do something?

00:58.152 --> 00:59.484
No, not a chance.

00:59.570 --> 01:01.987
How do you know? I can't remember anything.

01:02.073 --> 01:04.489
Because I know you, you're not
capable of anything like that.

01:07.361 --> 01:09.078
When... when did
you get here?

01:09.112 --> 01:10.162
Just a few minutes ago.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.665
What...

01:15.085 --> 01:16.368
Did you kill him?

01:16.454 --> 01:18.620
- That's... that's the ambulance, okay?
- What?

01:18.673 --> 01:20.456
- Hold... hold right there.
- What do you mean?

01:20.507 --> 01:22.625
Don't move, you got a
nasty gash on your head.

01:22.710 --> 01:24.460
You're gonna need stitches.

01:24.512 --> 01:27.462
Okay, just be still, okay?

02:01.498 --> 02:02.748
Almost done.

02:04.301 --> 02:05.501
Hey!

02:05.552 --> 02:07.837
Things will be fuzzy for a few hours.

02:07.888 --> 02:08.919
Get off!

02:09.007 --> 02:11.507
But there's no evidence of a concussion.

02:14.762 --> 02:17.312
Stitches will dissolve in about a week.

02:17.348 --> 02:19.348
Slide on over.

02:19.433 --> 02:20.816
And in the meantime,

02:20.852 --> 02:22.518
you need to get plenty of rest.

02:22.569 --> 02:24.402
Okay, thank you.

02:24.489 --> 02:26.072
You were very lucky.

02:30.027 --> 02:31.360
Carter, can you hear me?

02:33.081 --> 02:35.997
Wait, what were you doing at the bar?

02:36.033 --> 02:37.533
Well, I...

02:38.786 --> 02:41.420
I was upset about losing custody of Ben

02:41.506 --> 02:44.372
and I wanted to give
Jared a piece of my mind.

02:44.425 --> 02:46.259
Carter?

02:46.343 --> 02:47.376
Hey.

02:47.461 --> 02:49.711
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

02:49.796 --> 02:50.879
She hit her head pretty good.

02:50.932 --> 02:52.381
Ten stitches, but no concussion.

02:52.432 --> 02:53.716
What were you doing there?

02:53.800 --> 02:56.218
He could have killed you.

02:56.304 --> 02:57.218
Hey, Liz?

02:57.305 --> 02:58.721
Hey.

02:58.805 --> 03:00.889
We're here for Lori Stevens.

03:00.974 --> 03:01.941
Yeah.

03:02.026 --> 03:03.308
We need you to come down to the station

03:03.394 --> 03:05.561
and give a statement.

03:05.646 --> 03:08.614
Okay, uh... I'm gonna take care of this.

03:08.699 --> 03:10.483
Don't worry, I'll see you later, okay?

03:17.408 --> 03:18.707
She's okay, Max, I promise.

03:18.742 --> 03:20.543
But what's taking so long?

03:20.578 --> 03:21.711
They're giving her a bunch of tests

03:21.746 --> 03:22.995
and then she's gonna get stitches.

03:23.080 --> 03:24.913
<i>- How bad was she hurt?
- Not too bad.</i>

03:24.998 --> 03:26.748
But she seems pretty shaken up now.

03:26.834 --> 03:29.384
What did she say? Like, what happened?

03:29.420 --> 03:30.969
Max, Jared is dead.

03:32.473 --> 03:34.256
But it's okay, she's okay.

03:34.341 --> 03:35.390
Tell her I'll be right there.

03:35.425 --> 03:36.841
No, they're letting her go soon.

03:36.927 --> 03:38.894
<i>- We'll meet you at the house.
- Okay.</i>

03:38.930 --> 03:40.429
Bye.

03:42.432 --> 03:44.432
One minute we were fighting,

03:44.485 --> 03:46.769
and the next minute, I'm on the floor

03:46.820 --> 03:48.653
with a colossal headache,

03:48.740 --> 03:53.025
Lori's next to me, Jared's dead.

03:53.110 --> 03:55.694
Everything in the middle is a blank, Crash.

03:56.747 --> 03:58.614
I mean... do you think...

03:58.699 --> 04:00.366
- What?
- Do you think I killed him?

04:00.450 --> 04:01.700
No, no way.

04:01.786 --> 04:03.669
Crash, I might have... I
can't remember anything.

04:03.754 --> 04:05.955
Carter, you didn't. Believe me.

04:09.377 --> 04:10.793
God, how can he be dead?

04:12.462 --> 04:13.712
I'm so sorry.

04:18.353 --> 04:19.634
Thank you for being here.

04:20.805 --> 04:22.053
Hey.

04:23.358 --> 04:26.141
Um, Crash, can you just
give us a couple minutes?

04:26.226 --> 04:29.362
Detective McCarthy wants to
ask Carter a few questions.

04:29.447 --> 04:30.812
Sure.

04:34.651 --> 04:35.735
Hi, Carter.

04:35.819 --> 04:37.153
- Hey.
- Hope you're doing okay.

04:37.204 --> 04:39.204
I just need to ask you a couple things.

04:39.290 --> 04:43.324
Were you and Mr. Peters
romantically involved?

04:43.411 --> 04:44.826
Uh, yeah, we were.

04:44.879 --> 04:46.745
We... we broke
up, though.

04:46.831 --> 04:48.497
But you were at the bar tonight?

04:48.548 --> 04:50.331
- Yes.
- And you had an argument?

04:50.418 --> 04:51.584
Mm-hmm.

04:51.668 --> 04:53.468
Things can get kind of heated between exes.

04:53.504 --> 04:55.504
Would you say you were pretty upset?

04:55.590 --> 04:57.889
Um... yeah, I was.

04:57.975 --> 04:59.225
You know what, on second thought,

04:59.310 --> 05:01.476
I'm thinking that these questions can wait.

05:01.512 --> 05:04.180
Sorry, Liz, I need to ask them.

05:04.232 --> 05:06.264
Okay.

05:06.350 --> 05:10.019
Maybe he got a little
physical and you reacted.

05:10.103 --> 05:12.021
No one would blame you for
trying to protect yourself.

05:12.072 --> 05:14.355
You're not suggesting that she
had anything to do with this

05:14.442 --> 05:16.158
because she was unconscious.

05:16.194 --> 05:18.360
She was fully conscious
when the EMTs arrived.

05:18.446 --> 05:19.944
He's right, I was.

05:20.031 --> 05:23.115
When tempers run high, things can spiral.

05:23.201 --> 05:25.785
Maybe you hit Mr. Peters with a bottle,

05:25.870 --> 05:27.286
then knocked yourself out.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.838
Okay, all right, we're done.

05:29.874 --> 05:32.540
She's not saying another
word without an attorney.

05:32.593 --> 05:33.959
I'll be in touch.

05:38.632 --> 05:42.550
Did you have any idea he was a bad dude?

05:42.637 --> 05:43.769
I had no idea.

05:43.855 --> 05:45.137
I only met him a couple times,

05:45.223 --> 05:46.439
but he seemed normal.

05:46.524 --> 05:49.358
How are you supposed to know
who's good and who isn't when

05:49.393 --> 05:53.728
people like that just walk
around with everyone else?

05:53.781 --> 05:57.316
You just gotta use your instincts.

05:57.401 --> 06:01.903
And realize that some things
aren't in your control.

06:01.988 --> 06:05.574
Yeah, well, that's the problem, you know?

06:05.660 --> 06:07.576
Nothing's in anyone's control.

06:18.956 --> 06:20.488
I have a few more questions.

06:20.557 --> 06:22.625
You told the officers at
the scene you went to the bar

06:22.692 --> 06:23.826
to see Jared Peters.

06:23.894 --> 06:24.894
That's right, I did.

06:24.928 --> 06:26.762
Why did you go?

06:26.814 --> 06:27.980
I was angry.

06:28.064 --> 06:29.598
Look, you already know all of this.

06:29.649 --> 06:30.766
He turned in my son.

06:30.851 --> 06:32.518
And you were going there to confront him?

06:32.603 --> 06:34.737
That's right. And when I got there...

06:34.771 --> 06:36.771
I saw him choking my daughter.

06:38.826 --> 06:40.692
So I killed him.

06:45.620 --> 06:48.637
I'm sorry, Carter, but Lori confessed.

06:48.723 --> 06:50.305
Well, I guess that's it, then.

06:50.391 --> 06:52.007
- Mystery solved.
- That doesn't make any sense.

06:52.093 --> 06:54.226
Why wouldn't she just tell
me that when I came to?

06:54.262 --> 06:56.596
Because you were hurt
and she was distracted.

06:56.648 --> 06:59.264
No, but I... I asked her point-blank.

06:59.350 --> 07:01.600
And what did she say?

07:01.653 --> 07:02.767
Well, she didn't
answer, but I...

07:02.853 --> 07:04.269
Okay, well, she went there

07:04.322 --> 07:06.322
to confront him about Ben, right?

07:06.406 --> 07:08.274
And it turned ugly...
it makes sense.

07:08.358 --> 07:10.942
We all know Lori's no saint,
but she's not a murderer.

07:13.197 --> 07:14.747
There's got to be more to the story.

07:14.781 --> 07:16.449
There usually is with her.

07:16.500 --> 07:17.783
Where is she now?

07:17.836 --> 07:19.201
She's in a holding cell
down at the station.

07:19.286 --> 07:21.286
They're gonna transfer
her to county tomorrow.

07:21.338 --> 07:23.004
I need to see her.

07:23.091 --> 07:24.706
No, whoa! Carter!

07:24.792 --> 07:27.125
What you need is a good night's sleep.

07:29.680 --> 07:31.463
Okay, but I'm driving.

07:36.471 --> 07:38.637
Amanda, this doesn't make sense.

07:38.689 --> 07:40.973
I'm his father, he should be with me.

07:43.360 --> 07:46.228
There's no reason he needs
to be back in the system.

07:49.901 --> 07:52.067
Well, is there any way to fast-track it?

07:55.572 --> 07:57.490
All right.

07:57.542 --> 07:58.957
All right, well...

07:58.992 --> 08:01.326
let me know as soon as he
checks into the safe house,

08:01.411 --> 08:03.495
and keep me posted about the paperwork.

08:05.333 --> 08:06.499
Thank you.

08:07.834 --> 08:09.084
Hey.

08:10.555 --> 08:12.004
What's going on?

08:12.089 --> 08:14.673
Your mom and I are
petitioning for custody of Ben.

08:17.011 --> 08:19.644
- You okay with that?
- Yeah.

08:19.680 --> 08:21.846
Yeah, I'm fine with that.

08:21.932 --> 08:24.065
How do you think Lori's gonna take it?

08:24.151 --> 08:26.519
Well, she's got bigger things
to worry about right now.

08:26.603 --> 08:28.771
Yeah, I guess so.

08:32.693 --> 08:34.326
I think...

08:34.361 --> 08:37.245
I think I should probably
do this by myself.

08:39.866 --> 08:41.701
Okay.

08:41.753 --> 08:43.869
Okay, I'll see you.

08:43.922 --> 08:45.037
Thanks.

08:46.540 --> 08:47.873
Carter.

08:47.959 --> 08:50.209
Hi.

08:50.294 --> 08:51.711
Hi.

08:59.886 --> 09:01.721
Lori, are you covering for me?

09:02.856 --> 09:04.023
Did I kill Jared?

09:04.057 --> 09:05.557
No, of course not.

09:07.894 --> 09:10.145
- How's your head?
- Why did you confess?

09:12.951 --> 09:14.232
Because...

09:16.236 --> 09:18.903
I did it. I'm sorry.

09:20.291 --> 09:22.825
Lori, I need you to tell
me exactly what happened.

09:25.163 --> 09:27.712
I was out of my mind about losing Ben,

09:27.749 --> 09:29.548
and that was Jared's doing,

09:29.583 --> 09:32.084
so I went to confront him,

09:32.135 --> 09:34.636
try to get him to recant, you know?

09:34.721 --> 09:36.755
And when I got there...

09:36.841 --> 09:41.559
he was choking you, and I just lost it.

09:41.596 --> 09:46.231
I grabbed a bottle of
vodka off the bar and...

09:46.267 --> 09:47.767
I hit him.

09:47.851 --> 09:50.820
I just... I just wanted
him to stop hurting you.

09:50.904 --> 09:52.989
I guess he hit his head hard when he fell.

09:53.073 --> 09:54.606
Wait, so if you hadn't have
walked in, he would have...

09:54.658 --> 09:56.107
I'm glad I did.

10:00.782 --> 10:02.498
Well, okay, then it was an accident.

10:02.582 --> 10:05.116
Did you tell the police
you were just protecting me?

10:05.202 --> 10:06.118
Well, yeah.

10:06.203 --> 10:09.038
But... come on, given my history,

10:09.123 --> 10:12.792
I'm... not exactly a reliable witness.

10:12.876 --> 10:14.210
I've seen those forensic shows.

10:14.294 --> 10:16.044
If he died from hitting
his head on the floor,

10:16.129 --> 10:18.630
doesn't that affect what
they can charge you with?

10:18.716 --> 10:20.799
I don't know.

10:20.884 --> 10:22.768
We're gonna get you the
best lawyer and fight this.

10:22.803 --> 10:24.052
You're not gonna go to prison

10:24.138 --> 10:26.022
for doing the right thing.

10:26.106 --> 10:27.306
Okay?

10:31.562 --> 10:33.144
You're here late.

10:33.197 --> 10:35.648
I'm guessing this isn't a social call.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.316
Hey, uh, no.

10:39.370 --> 10:42.238
I need some information
on Lori Stevens' arrest.

10:42.322 --> 10:43.655
McCarthy's stonewalling.

10:43.707 --> 10:44.823
Can't really blame him, Liz.

10:44.875 --> 10:46.075
You're a little too close to this one.

10:46.159 --> 10:47.993
Come on, you gotta give me something.

10:54.585 --> 10:56.802
Word is Stevens couldn't wait to spill.

10:56.837 --> 10:59.504
Offered up a confession
before McCarthy even got going.

10:59.590 --> 11:01.090
- Really?
- That's what I'm hearing.

11:01.174 --> 11:03.259
Oh, and by the way, the task force

11:03.344 --> 11:04.393
lost ties on Rick Barnes.

11:04.479 --> 11:05.845
What? When?

11:05.897 --> 11:08.063
Right after his six-figure
lawyer got him out on bail.

11:08.149 --> 11:10.265
We were supposed to have guys on him 24/7.

11:10.350 --> 11:12.150
Apparently, he just vanished into thin air.

11:12.186 --> 11:13.735
That's great.

11:13.821 --> 11:16.020
He's gonna want to get rid
of anyone who can ID him.

11:16.073 --> 11:18.023
Ben Wallace needs to watch his back.

11:18.076 --> 11:19.774
He's going out of town to a group home.

11:19.860 --> 11:21.192
- He's safe.
- Glad to hear it.

11:21.245 --> 11:24.363
Scumbag like Barnes is not
gonna take any prisoners.

11:28.201 --> 11:30.034
Something about her story doesn't add up.

11:30.087 --> 11:31.202
Or maybe it's just hard

11:31.288 --> 11:33.205
thinking she just killed someone.

11:34.709 --> 11:36.008
Yeah.

11:36.043 --> 11:37.543
But it's more than that.

11:37.628 --> 11:39.128
Lori would do anything for you,

11:39.212 --> 11:40.796
especially if someone was hurting you.

11:40.881 --> 11:42.380
Yeah, I know that.

11:42.466 --> 11:44.799
And her lack of boundaries
has been well documented,

11:44.885 --> 11:46.469
but this is different.

11:47.971 --> 11:50.855
She says she went to the bar to see Jared

11:50.892 --> 11:52.975
because she was freaking
out about losing Ben.

11:53.059 --> 11:54.143
Yeah.

11:54.227 --> 11:56.061
But when she got there, he was choking me,

11:56.114 --> 11:57.779
- so she grabbed a bottle...
- Wait, wait, back up.

11:57.865 --> 11:59.731
You never told me he choked you.

11:59.817 --> 12:01.783
I don't remember it.

12:01.869 --> 12:03.201
I did black out.

12:03.236 --> 12:07.239
Still, I don't see you
forgetting being choked.

12:07.325 --> 12:08.823
How's your neck feel?

12:10.745 --> 12:11.961
Fine.

12:12.046 --> 12:13.495
If someone was choking
you, it'd still be sore

12:13.581 --> 12:14.913
a few hours after.

12:14.966 --> 12:17.716
And you'd have some kind
of marks around your neck.

12:17.751 --> 12:19.335
See?

12:19.419 --> 12:21.470
If Lori made that part up,
what else is she lying about?

12:21.556 --> 12:25.224
Why would she confess to
a murder she didn't commit?

12:25.259 --> 12:27.426
She's got to be protecting someone.

12:27.511 --> 12:28.760
Who?

12:30.014 --> 12:32.565
Ben's social worker just called me back.

12:32.600 --> 12:33.932
Is everything okay?

12:33.985 --> 12:36.851
No, he never showed up at the group home.

12:36.937 --> 12:38.821
He disappeared on the way.

12:45.408 --> 12:46.825
His phone's still off.

12:46.860 --> 12:48.025
Look, I wouldn't worry.

12:48.077 --> 12:49.577
Ben knows how to take care of himself.

12:49.663 --> 12:51.245
We should have known this would happen.

12:51.331 --> 12:52.947
He'd never go back to
one of those group homes.

12:53.033 --> 12:55.584
I'm sure he's just laying
low for now, he'll turn up.

12:58.038 --> 13:00.455
Uh... where are the eggs?

13:00.541 --> 13:03.542
Why are there never any eggs
in here when I need them?!

13:03.594 --> 13:06.544
Taylor, maybe this isn't
the time for carbonara.

13:06.629 --> 13:09.047
I cook when I'm nervous,
Dad. Everyone knows that.

13:09.133 --> 13:11.265
How could they have let
him out of their sights?

13:11.350 --> 13:13.518
'Cause he disappeared when
the van stopped for gas.

13:13.553 --> 13:15.553
- When was that?
- A few hours ago.

13:15.605 --> 13:17.471
- He could be anywhere.
- Wait, wait, wait.

13:17.557 --> 13:20.192
So when I went to the bar,
when everything happened,

13:20.226 --> 13:22.059
Ben was already missing?

13:22.145 --> 13:24.446
He would have been, yeah.

13:24.530 --> 13:26.730
Oh my God.

13:26.783 --> 13:28.066
- What?
- What if...

13:28.152 --> 13:29.484
You think Ben killed Jared?

13:29.570 --> 13:32.486
I don't know, but I know
Lori's covering for someone.

13:34.124 --> 13:35.956
Really? And how do you know that?

13:36.043 --> 13:37.576
Because I do, Tay,

13:37.661 --> 13:39.711
and no one knows where he was.

13:39.745 --> 13:41.830
Is he capable of that?

13:41.914 --> 13:43.414
No, he's not.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.299
Lori, on the other hand, is.

13:45.384 --> 13:46.750
Taylor, why are you so determined

13:46.803 --> 13:48.169
to think she did this?

13:48.254 --> 13:50.889
Well, maybe because she was
never punished for what she did,

13:50.923 --> 13:53.758
to you, to all of us,

13:53.844 --> 13:56.727
and now she's confessed, and
why can't you accept that?

13:56.763 --> 14:00.097
Because something's not
right about it, Taylor.

14:00.149 --> 14:01.899
I don't want to think Ben's involved.

14:01.934 --> 14:03.434
Really?

14:03.519 --> 14:05.187
Because it seems like you
would throw him under the bus

14:05.272 --> 14:07.322
before believing the truth about her.

14:08.774 --> 14:10.774
I'm just trying to get to the bottom of it.

14:13.913 --> 14:15.529
I need to call Mom.

14:19.168 --> 14:20.335
Mom, do you think...

14:20.419 --> 14:21.452
<i>I don't know, Carter.</i>

14:21.538 --> 14:23.504
If Ben's been missing all this time...

14:23.590 --> 14:25.956
I keep thinking about something he said.

14:26.043 --> 14:27.458
<i>What?</i>

14:27.510 --> 14:28.927
It's just...
nothing.

14:28.961 --> 14:31.379
Carter, if you know
something, you have to tell me.

14:31.465 --> 14:33.465
It's just... something he said

14:33.517 --> 14:34.883
when he was still in juvie.

14:34.967 --> 14:36.134
<i>- What?
- He said</i>

14:36.220 --> 14:38.135
I shouldn't worry about Jared,

14:38.187 --> 14:39.386
because people like him

14:39.472 --> 14:41.389
always get what's coming to them.

14:42.692 --> 14:45.143
Uh, I'm gonna call you back.

14:45.229 --> 14:46.394
Bye.

14:53.986 --> 14:56.288
Hey. Where are you going?

14:56.322 --> 15:00.542
Uh... with Crash to get some of his stuff.

15:01.827 --> 15:05.212
Look, I just... I
wanted to say I'm sorry.

15:05.298 --> 15:07.999
I didn't mean to be so harsh.

15:08.085 --> 15:10.251
It's fine, I know how you feel about her.

15:10.336 --> 15:11.919
And I know you love her.

15:13.423 --> 15:16.057
But someone did this.

15:16.143 --> 15:18.393
And when they figure out who it was,

15:18.477 --> 15:21.096
I just want you to know
that I'll be here for you,

15:21.181 --> 15:22.514
no matter what.

15:23.817 --> 15:24.849
Thank you.

15:28.020 --> 15:30.989
I made sure that no one
could hear us in here.

15:31.024 --> 15:32.240
Okay.

15:32.326 --> 15:33.825
I need you to be straight with me.

15:33.860 --> 15:34.942
What do you mean?

15:35.028 --> 15:37.195
Ben killed Jared and
you're covering for him.

15:37.246 --> 15:39.246
What?

15:39.332 --> 15:41.832
- Uh, no, that's... insane.
- Is it?

15:41.868 --> 15:43.751
Because no one can attest
to Ben's whereabouts

15:43.836 --> 15:45.370
at the time of Jared's death.

15:45.422 --> 15:47.288
He was in custody when it happened.

15:49.960 --> 15:51.375
No.

15:51.461 --> 15:54.712
Lori... he wasn't in custody,

15:54.764 --> 15:56.847
he never made it to the group home.

15:56.883 --> 15:58.432
What are you talking about?

15:58.518 --> 16:00.134
He was with social services,
they were taking him there.

16:00.220 --> 16:02.052
He ran... nobody
knows where he is.

16:05.808 --> 16:08.393
He's supposed to testify
against that dealer,

16:08.477 --> 16:09.693
so he could be in danger right now.

16:09.730 --> 16:11.980
I'm gonna do everything that I can.

16:13.366 --> 16:14.566
I promise.

16:17.571 --> 16:19.037
<i>Hey, it's Max.</i>

16:19.072 --> 16:20.788
<i>Leave me a message, I'll call you back.</i>

16:22.075 --> 16:25.243
Hey. Uh... it's me again.

16:25.328 --> 16:27.879
Just wondering where you are.

16:27.913 --> 16:31.216
There is a lot of stuff going on here,

16:31.250 --> 16:32.917
and you said you were coming over, so...

16:34.638 --> 16:36.471
Um, call me back.

16:42.928 --> 16:44.312
<i>Hey, this is Ben.</i>

16:44.398 --> 16:46.014
<i>Leave a message.</i>

16:46.099 --> 16:47.432
Ben, it's Elizabeth.

16:47.517 --> 16:50.018
I need you to call me, please.

16:50.102 --> 16:51.318
I...

16:52.522 --> 16:53.772
I don't mean to scare you,

16:53.823 --> 16:56.106
but you could be in serious danger.

16:56.158 --> 16:59.159
I just need you to let
me know where you are.

16:59.245 --> 17:00.361
I will pick you up.

17:00.447 --> 17:03.447
I will make sure that you're safe.

17:03.533 --> 17:06.451
Ben... please.

17:14.260 --> 17:16.877
Hey, I've been knocking
for the last two minutes.

17:16.962 --> 17:18.296
I know, I heard.

17:18.382 --> 17:20.181
Um, can I come in?

17:20.267 --> 17:23.018
Actually, now is not really a good time.

17:23.103 --> 17:24.469
Max, what is going on?

17:24.554 --> 17:25.804
You're not answering your phone

17:25.887 --> 17:28.189
and... and now
I can't come in?

17:28.275 --> 17:30.442
I know, I...

17:30.477 --> 17:32.309
I'm just, um...

17:32.395 --> 17:34.479
- Are you drunk?
- No, I'm not drunk.

17:34.530 --> 17:35.730
You smell like a distillery.

17:35.816 --> 17:38.148
Taylor, actually, I got some company here.

17:38.234 --> 17:40.117
- Company?
- Mm-hmm.

17:40.153 --> 17:42.037
Oh, what, do you... do
you have a girl in there?

17:42.122 --> 17:44.905
- Don't be crazy.
- Well, you're making me feel crazy.

17:46.710 --> 17:48.326
What is going on?

17:51.131 --> 17:52.163
Ben.

17:53.717 --> 17:54.798
Hi.

17:54.835 --> 17:55.916
Hi.

17:59.673 --> 18:01.423
Go in.

18:10.733 --> 18:11.982
I'm just gonna grab my stuff.

18:12.018 --> 18:13.183
I'll be like 30 seconds.

18:13.236 --> 18:14.486
Oh, okay.

18:14.520 --> 18:17.939
Crash... thanks for coming to stay.

18:18.023 --> 18:20.858
I feel better knowing you're in the house.

18:20.943 --> 18:22.076
Sure.

18:25.365 --> 18:26.780
Are you feeling okay?

18:26.866 --> 18:28.249
I don't know.

18:28.335 --> 18:30.201
You don't have to be.

18:30.252 --> 18:32.119
It's just weird.

18:32.204 --> 18:33.872
My mom said Lori thought Ben

18:33.957 --> 18:35.539
was in the group home
when everything happened,

18:35.625 --> 18:37.459
so she couldn't have been covering for him.

18:37.544 --> 18:39.009
That's got to be a relief.

18:39.045 --> 18:40.295
If Ben didn't do it.

18:40.380 --> 18:41.429
Yeah, no, it is.

18:41.515 --> 18:44.382
He's in way too deep as it is.

18:44.433 --> 18:46.267
Carter, we'll figure it out.

18:46.353 --> 18:47.602
I promise.

18:55.479 --> 18:57.561
I'm really happy you're here.

18:57.614 --> 18:59.614
Anytime you need me.

18:59.699 --> 19:02.784
Whatever it is, wherever I
am, I'll be there for you.

19:09.826 --> 19:11.409
I'll be right back.

19:25.842 --> 19:28.593
- That was quick.
- Hey.

19:36.811 --> 19:37.978
Sorry to startle you.

19:38.063 --> 19:40.646
- Who the hell are you?
- You know who I am.

19:40.699 --> 19:42.315
I'm friends with Jared.

19:42.366 --> 19:43.817
We were business associates.

19:43.902 --> 19:45.317
For the record, I didn't touch him.

19:45.403 --> 19:46.987
I'm not here to hurt anyone.

19:47.038 --> 19:48.622
I just need to talk to your brother.

19:48.656 --> 19:49.990
What do you want with my brother?

19:50.041 --> 19:51.374
That's between him and me.

19:51.460 --> 19:52.791
Well, I... I don't
know where he is.

19:52.827 --> 19:54.827
- I think you do.
- Well, you're wrong.

19:56.914 --> 19:59.715
You see him, tell him
I've got something for him.

20:08.343 --> 20:10.509
What is it with you and just disappearing?

20:10.561 --> 20:12.394
What, did you really think I was
just gonna go back to foster care?

20:12.480 --> 20:14.013
Well, you need to let
everyone know you're safe

20:14.098 --> 20:16.482
- so they stop looking for you.
- Why?

20:16.518 --> 20:17.933
I'm not even sure if I'm sticking around.

20:18.936 --> 20:20.487
Because we're your family.

20:20.521 --> 20:22.189
And because we care about you.

20:22.240 --> 20:24.824
And it's not fair to let them think

20:24.859 --> 20:26.910
that you're just in a ditch somewhere.

20:26.994 --> 20:28.244
Okay, really? Lying in a ditch?

20:28.329 --> 20:29.578
That seems a bit dramatic.

20:29.664 --> 20:31.330
Look, Jared is dead and Lori's in jail.

20:31.365 --> 20:34.750
- Things are a bit dramatic.
- Wait, Jared's dead?

20:34.836 --> 20:36.536
Lori's in jail? When did that happen?

20:36.587 --> 20:39.506
Well, a while ago, that's
why I was trying to reach you.

20:39.540 --> 20:42.041
Okay, well, why is she in jail?

20:42.094 --> 20:43.876
She confessed to killing Jared.

20:46.181 --> 20:47.213
Uh...

20:49.101 --> 20:50.049
Okay.

20:50.102 --> 20:51.634
Start from the top, what happened?

20:51.720 --> 20:54.604
There was an altercation at the bar

20:54.690 --> 20:56.355
between Carter and Jared.

20:56.391 --> 21:00.809
Lori stepped in to try and
stop it and, in the process,

21:00.895 --> 21:03.813
apparently killed Jared.

21:08.319 --> 21:09.236
Jesus.

21:09.288 --> 21:10.703
And no one knows where you are,

21:10.739 --> 21:12.038
so we really have to let them know.

21:12.074 --> 21:14.406
Will you call Dad? And I will call Carter.

21:16.044 --> 21:17.493
Hey, where are you going?

21:17.578 --> 21:19.078
I gotta take care of something.

21:20.414 --> 21:21.664
<i>Hey.</i>

21:21.750 --> 21:23.165
Hey. I found Ben.

21:23.251 --> 21:24.667
<i>He was at Max's.</i>

21:24.752 --> 21:25.801
<i>Okay, keep him there.</i>

21:25.886 --> 21:27.086
We'll come over now.

21:27.172 --> 21:28.805
Okay.

21:41.686 --> 21:43.019
What's wrong?

21:45.022 --> 21:47.324
Were you and Max drinking?

21:47.409 --> 21:49.608
No. Why?

21:49.661 --> 21:51.827
It must have been before you got here.

21:51.913 --> 21:54.114
It's just not like him to drink alone.

21:54.199 --> 21:57.500
Well, it's last call somewhere, right?

22:05.626 --> 22:06.843
What's wrong?

22:06.928 --> 22:08.595
It's about Ben.

22:08.630 --> 22:09.762
Oh, God.

22:09.798 --> 22:11.381
No, it's not what you think.

22:11.465 --> 22:12.464
He's safe.

22:14.269 --> 22:16.853
- Where is he?
- At Max's, temporarily.

22:16.938 --> 22:20.022
- Okay.
- Lori...

22:20.107 --> 22:23.309
the state released Ben into our custody.

22:24.613 --> 22:26.363
He's coming to live with us.

22:28.482 --> 22:30.482
I know that must be hard for you.

22:31.702 --> 22:36.405
I... guess this is what I deserve.

22:39.327 --> 22:40.826
All of this.

22:40.912 --> 22:45.664
Lori... Ben is your child.

22:45.717 --> 22:48.884
He will always be your child.

22:53.674 --> 22:54.891
Hey.

22:54.976 --> 22:56.509
- Hey.
-  Hey.

22:56.560 --> 22:57.727
Are you okay?

22:57.813 --> 22:59.429
Yeah, I'm okay. You?

22:59.513 --> 23:01.347
Yeah, she's fine, considering your friend

23:01.400 --> 23:02.432
Rick just ambushed her.

23:02.517 --> 23:04.517
- Wait, what?!
- Crash, don't.

23:04.568 --> 23:05.684
What do you mean?

23:05.770 --> 23:06.903
Wait, wait, wait, who's Rick?

23:06.988 --> 23:08.688
Some guy Jared used to work for.

23:08.740 --> 23:10.105
He wants you to call him.

23:10.192 --> 23:11.990
- Who is he?
- He's just some dirtbag.

23:12.027 --> 23:14.411
Looks like not much has
changed since I left.

23:14.496 --> 23:16.162
Except for you two, right?

23:16.198 --> 23:17.163
Because you guys aren't together anymore.

23:17.199 --> 23:18.530
- Ben.
- I'm still her friend.

23:18.583 --> 23:21.367
Could we please not do this right now?

23:21.420 --> 23:22.868
Fine, sorry.

23:24.088 --> 23:25.538
Are you gonna call him?

23:25.624 --> 23:26.873
No.

23:26.958 --> 23:28.458
Now that Jared's dead,
I'm the only one who can

23:28.542 --> 23:29.843
tie him back to Seth's death.

23:29.877 --> 23:30.926
Okay, well, what are you gonna do?

23:31.011 --> 23:32.211
Lay low at your house.

23:32.263 --> 23:33.712
David talked social
services into giving them

23:33.798 --> 23:35.048
custody of me for now.

23:35.099 --> 23:36.715
Actually, I should get over there.

23:36.768 --> 23:38.017
Okay, let's go.

23:38.052 --> 23:39.551
I'm gonna wait for Max.

23:41.440 --> 23:42.471
Where is he?

23:42.557 --> 23:43.856
I'm not sure.

23:43.892 --> 23:45.808
Okay, well, we'll wait with you.

23:47.479 --> 23:49.445
I can just take Ben.

23:49.530 --> 23:51.730
Oh, great.

23:51.817 --> 23:54.317
I mean, yeah, thank you. That'd be great.

23:56.704 --> 23:57.820
What's up with Max?

23:59.907 --> 24:01.407
I don't know.

24:01.492 --> 24:03.792
Carter, I'm worried about him.

24:03.878 --> 24:04.993
He's been acting really weird

24:05.079 --> 24:06.578
since this whole thing happened

24:06.631 --> 24:09.499
and when I showed up
here, he reeked of booze.

24:09.584 --> 24:12.836
It was like whiskey or vodka or something

24:12.921 --> 24:14.921
and now I can't reach him.

24:15.006 --> 24:16.506
I don't know where he is.

24:18.093 --> 24:19.843
Well, did you text him?

24:19.928 --> 24:21.478
Yeah, right before you got here.

24:24.398 --> 24:25.832
Oh, my God.

24:25.901 --> 24:27.066
What?

24:27.134 --> 24:28.835
I know who Lori's covering for.

24:28.903 --> 24:30.103
Who?

24:32.240 --> 24:33.272
Max.

24:38.864 --> 24:40.447
Max killed Jared.

24:52.955 --> 24:55.073
No, there's no way,
that's... that's crazy.

24:55.173 --> 24:57.007
Taylor, nothing else makes sense.

24:57.058 --> 24:58.807
Lori makes sense.

24:58.844 --> 25:00.343
Carter, she confessed!

25:00.394 --> 25:02.561
Yeah, she confessed because
she was covering for someone.

25:02.647 --> 25:03.846
We're talking about Max here.

25:03.914 --> 25:05.097
Right!

25:06.101 --> 25:08.233
Tay, think about it.

25:08.319 --> 25:10.269
Lori said she hit Jared over the head

25:10.355 --> 25:12.188
with a bottle of vodka.

25:12.273 --> 25:14.990
You just said Max reeked of booze.

25:15.027 --> 25:17.027
And he hasn't been here all day.

25:17.078 --> 25:18.278
When was the last time I was in trouble

25:18.363 --> 25:19.778
and Max didn't show up?

25:21.866 --> 25:23.866
You said he's been acting
funny since it happened...

25:23.919 --> 25:25.035
Carter.

25:25.119 --> 25:26.251
Well, it raises some questions, at least.

25:26.337 --> 25:28.421
Well, maybe the answer is

25:28.507 --> 25:30.457
the person who was standing
over you when you woke up,

25:30.541 --> 25:33.759
who also happens to be a crazy kidnapper.

25:33.845 --> 25:37.047
Tay, where was he tonight?

25:37.098 --> 25:39.382
I don't... I don't know.

25:53.781 --> 25:55.365
<i>Hey,
it's Max. Leave me a message,</i>

25:55.400 --> 25:57.951
<i>- I'll call you back.
- He's not answering.</i>

25:58.036 --> 25:59.035
Where is he?

25:59.070 --> 26:00.819
I think I know.

26:11.916 --> 26:14.584
Max, you shouldn't be here.

26:17.422 --> 26:19.588
Hey!

26:19.641 --> 26:22.808
So, uh... how you doing down here?

26:22.894 --> 26:26.145
I know it's a little "basementy."

26:26.230 --> 26:27.430
Ah, as far as foster homes go,

26:27.516 --> 26:29.265
you guys have got a five-star rating.

26:29.351 --> 26:31.151
Nah, wait 'til you taste my meatloaf.

26:31.236 --> 26:34.269
David, please, we want him to stay.

26:34.355 --> 26:35.688
You're gonna need these.

26:35.773 --> 26:36.823
Thanks.

26:36.907 --> 26:38.107
Anything else you need?

26:38.192 --> 26:39.275
No. No, it's fine.

26:39.361 --> 26:40.777
Really, it's more than fine.

26:40.862 --> 26:42.112
I owe you guys.

26:42.197 --> 26:43.613
You don't owe us a thing.

26:43.664 --> 26:45.198
It's just, uh,

26:45.282 --> 26:49.035
no one's ever taken me in
as one of their own before.

26:49.121 --> 26:51.703
You know, not until
you guys and Lori, so...

26:54.209 --> 26:56.209
You are one of our own.

26:59.346 --> 27:03.298
And I can bring you to see
Lori later, if you want.

27:03.384 --> 27:05.018
Rick's still out there looking for me.

27:05.103 --> 27:06.469
I didn't know if it was safe.

27:06.555 --> 27:08.971
Ben, we're definitely going to get Rick.

27:09.023 --> 27:10.472
I promise you.

27:10.525 --> 27:12.808
But in the meantime,
there's a detail outside

27:12.861 --> 27:17.063
that's gonna follow us wherever
we go, until we do get him.

27:17.148 --> 27:18.647
Wow.

27:18.700 --> 27:20.866
The first time a cop's been
at my house to protect me

27:20.951 --> 27:22.367
and not arrest me.

27:22.453 --> 27:23.869
It's kind of nice.

27:23.954 --> 27:25.320
Yeah.

27:25.373 --> 27:28.040
Okay, we'll leave you to your unpacking.

27:28.125 --> 27:29.159
Thanks.

27:44.175 --> 27:46.342
Hey, it's me.

27:47.846 --> 27:50.596
Yeah, can we...
can we meet up?

27:50.682 --> 27:52.147
I didn't know you were here.

27:52.183 --> 27:54.017
I've been trying to call you,
you didn't answer your phone,

27:54.068 --> 27:55.184
I went to your house.

27:55.269 --> 27:57.019
There's no phone privileges here.

27:57.072 --> 27:58.354
This is not what I wanted.

27:58.440 --> 28:00.490
I'm supposed to be the
one in here, not you.

28:00.525 --> 28:01.990
You have to trust me.

28:02.027 --> 28:03.609
- This is the way it's supposed to be.
- No.

28:03.694 --> 28:05.494
- I shouldn't have left you.
- I made you leave.

28:05.529 --> 28:07.247
Lori, you didn't make me do anything.

28:07.332 --> 28:09.833
Max, if I had gotten there first,

28:09.867 --> 28:11.584
if I had seen him hitting Carter,

28:11.670 --> 28:14.170
I would have done exactly what you did.

28:14.205 --> 28:16.588
- You didn't, I did.
- No, I did.

28:17.759 --> 28:19.925
And none of it matters now.

28:27.801 --> 28:28.718
No.

28:30.471 --> 28:32.188
No, this is all my fault.

28:32.223 --> 28:34.557
- Oh, Max.
- It happened really fast.

28:34.643 --> 28:36.726
You didn't do anything wrong.

28:36.810 --> 28:39.229
I did, so start accepting that now.

28:39.280 --> 28:40.563
No, I'm not gonna let you do that.

28:40.615 --> 28:41.865
I have to tell the truth.

28:41.900 --> 28:44.534
What good is that gonna do anybody?

28:44.568 --> 28:48.153
You have your whole life in front of you.

28:48.240 --> 28:50.289
You have Ben to take care of.

28:50.375 --> 28:52.791
No, I don't.

28:52.877 --> 28:54.661
The state made sure of that.

28:59.217 --> 29:02.669
I've made so many mistakes,

29:02.753 --> 29:06.588
and I have finally done something good...

29:06.674 --> 29:09.759
for you and Taylor and Carter.

29:11.346 --> 29:12.811
Please don't take that away from me.

29:15.066 --> 29:16.766
Please.

29:24.526 --> 29:25.857
There he is.

29:34.952 --> 29:36.536
Max!

29:40.258 --> 29:42.174
We need to talk.

29:42.259 --> 29:44.126
Yeah, we do.

29:44.211 --> 29:45.127
Taylor, not here.

29:46.631 --> 29:48.631
All right, come on.

30:03.480 --> 30:05.480
Where should I start?

30:05.532 --> 30:06.865
Uh, the beginning?

30:06.951 --> 30:09.818
What were you doing at the bar?

30:09.871 --> 30:12.538
I was worried that you
were going to see Jared.

30:12.624 --> 30:15.407
I didn't want you to be alone with him.

30:15.492 --> 30:17.160
You don't deserve to be a dad.

30:17.244 --> 30:18.544
And you know what?

30:18.630 --> 30:19.796
As soon as the truth comes out,

30:19.830 --> 30:21.213
the only place your little girl is gonna

30:21.298 --> 30:22.298
see you is in prison.

30:22.334 --> 30:24.717
- Hey!
- Get off!

30:47.107 --> 30:49.025
No, no.

30:54.031 --> 30:55.198
Here.

30:57.451 --> 30:59.335
No...

31:05.376 --> 31:07.426
Oh my God, Carter!

31:07.511 --> 31:09.095
Carter! Max!

31:09.180 --> 31:10.128
Max, what happened?

31:10.214 --> 31:11.713
You call for help!

31:11.799 --> 31:14.549
- What happened?
- Please, call for help!

31:14.635 --> 31:16.551
Okay, she's breathing, she's breathing.

31:16.637 --> 31:17.720
Carter, honey.

31:17.771 --> 31:19.721
Carter, can you hear me? No, no.

31:19.773 --> 31:22.392
Yes, we need an ambulance
at Larchwood and Nutley.

31:22.477 --> 31:24.359
A bar called Magic Hour.

31:24.395 --> 31:26.945
Hurry, please!

31:27.031 --> 31:28.448
Tell me what happened, Max.

31:28.532 --> 31:30.900
- It was an accident.
- Tell me!

31:30.984 --> 31:32.734
- No, no...
- What did you do?

31:32.787 --> 31:35.822
He shoved Carter, and then I just...

31:35.906 --> 31:38.240
- What?
- It was an accident.

31:42.413 --> 31:43.746
He's dead.

31:45.500 --> 31:48.134
No... no... no.

31:50.137 --> 31:51.086
No.

31:54.259 --> 31:55.223
No.

31:55.259 --> 31:57.093
Come on... come on.

31:57.177 --> 31:59.429
Max, you need to go.

31:59.480 --> 32:02.181
Max, Max, stop, get up.

32:02.267 --> 32:03.566
Get up, Max, stand up.

32:03.601 --> 32:05.317
Stand up. Look at me.

32:05.403 --> 32:06.986
Look... look at
me, look at me.

32:07.071 --> 32:09.605
Okay, you are gonna go right now,

32:09.691 --> 32:11.740
and you're gonna let
me deal with this, okay?

32:11.776 --> 32:14.359
You need to go before
anyone else gets here.

32:14.445 --> 32:16.278
You got it?

32:16.364 --> 32:17.696
Okay, go!

32:21.086 --> 32:23.752
Max, she's waking up, she's
gonna be okay, just go!

32:23.788 --> 32:26.622
Please. Go!

32:28.542 --> 32:30.041
So, I left.

32:32.096 --> 32:33.679
Max, we're gonna fix this, okay?

32:33.765 --> 32:35.932
We can go right back in
there and tell them the truth.

32:35.967 --> 32:37.016
No way! No.

32:37.102 --> 32:38.733
No one ever needs to know about this.

32:38.802 --> 32:40.802
Taylor, you're not seriously
suggesting he let Lori

32:40.888 --> 32:42.105
take the fall for this?

32:42.140 --> 32:43.638
Yeah, I am.

32:44.808 --> 32:46.308
Taylor, what are you doing?

32:54.523 --> 32:56.497
Lori made her choice. She
deserves to be in jail.

32:56.596 --> 32:57.813
Max doesn't.

32:57.847 --> 32:59.815
Of course he doesn't, Taylor.

32:59.849 --> 33:02.651
But they'll understand,
he was just defending me.

33:02.686 --> 33:04.019
Okay, he can't prove that, though.

33:04.105 --> 33:06.154
We've seen the justice system in action.

33:06.190 --> 33:08.190
Anything could happen. You know that.

33:08.241 --> 33:10.459
Your kidnapper walked out, no charges.

33:10.528 --> 33:11.693
She didn't kill anyone, Taylor.

33:11.746 --> 33:13.194
I don't care.

33:13.247 --> 33:14.829
She's where she belongs.

33:14.865 --> 33:17.415
Look, the longer we wait,
the harder it's gonna be.

33:17.500 --> 33:19.084
Not if we never say anything.

33:21.538 --> 33:23.204
I'm gonna get some air.

33:29.462 --> 33:31.096
He'll listen to you, Carter.

33:32.883 --> 33:34.932
You have to convince him.

33:38.556 --> 33:41.190
Didn't know you were still here.

33:41.224 --> 33:43.057
Yeah, I just needed to get some air.

33:46.697 --> 33:49.565
I had the same thought.

33:49.616 --> 33:52.734
So, how you holding up?

33:52.819 --> 33:55.069
I know what I need to do.

33:57.791 --> 34:00.409
I finally get it.

34:00.493 --> 34:01.576
What?

34:01.628 --> 34:05.130
Why you ran... when you shot me.

34:13.056 --> 34:16.342
Yeah, I go back there, in my mind.

34:16.427 --> 34:17.760
Yeah, me too.

34:18.978 --> 34:21.764
You can't, though.

34:21.849 --> 34:24.931
All you can do is keep going.

34:25.018 --> 34:28.570
I keep thinking how it
reminds me of my dad.

34:28.606 --> 34:30.773
You are not your dad.

34:30.858 --> 34:32.940
I didn't even think, though.

34:35.277 --> 34:38.996
I just saw him... hurting Carter.

34:40.751 --> 34:42.418
I wanted to smash his head in.

34:42.452 --> 34:43.952
You were protecting her.

34:45.289 --> 34:46.170
I know.

34:46.257 --> 34:50.041
But something inside me just snapped.

34:50.126 --> 34:53.295
It's not the same, Max.

34:53.380 --> 34:54.963
It's not.

34:57.635 --> 34:59.134
I hope you're right.

34:59.186 --> 35:02.471
I can't believe you're
choosing Lori over Max.

35:02.523 --> 35:04.021
I'm not, Taylor.

35:04.108 --> 35:07.809
I love Max, I would do anything for him.

35:07.894 --> 35:10.144
Carter, what...

35:10.231 --> 35:12.280
what if the shoe was on the other foot

35:12.315 --> 35:14.817
and you asked him to cover for you?

35:14.869 --> 35:16.150
He would do it.

35:16.202 --> 35:18.036
That's not the point, Taylor.

35:18.121 --> 35:19.822
Look, this thing is never gonna be over

35:19.907 --> 35:22.541
until he tells the truth.

35:22.626 --> 35:24.827
And Max is not gonna be
able to live with himself

35:24.911 --> 35:26.411
- if he doesn't.
- He'll learn.

35:26.496 --> 35:28.163
You know, people live with anything,

35:28.215 --> 35:29.998
just like we all did when she took you.

35:30.083 --> 35:32.501
This isn't about her, Taylor.

35:32.552 --> 35:34.001
This is about Max.

35:34.088 --> 35:39.007
What you're asking him to
do is going to ruin his life.

35:39.092 --> 35:43.061
Please, think about what
you're asking him to do, Tay.

35:47.601 --> 35:48.934
Taylor!

35:52.989 --> 35:54.856
- You're late.
- Yeah, I had to slip out.

35:56.327 --> 35:58.193
- I hear you've been looking for me.
- That's right.

35:58.244 --> 35:59.527
You thought the best way to get to me

35:59.612 --> 36:00.829
was to spook my sister?

36:00.864 --> 36:02.246
Just trying to get you a message.

36:02.333 --> 36:04.699
Yeah, well, I got your message.

36:04.751 --> 36:06.001
And now, I've got one for you.

36:06.036 --> 36:07.619
Oh, yeah? What's that?

36:07.704 --> 36:08.871
We're square.

36:08.922 --> 36:10.755
I don't care whether
the cops get you or not.

36:10.840 --> 36:12.541
I don't work for them.

36:12.626 --> 36:13.958
That's all I wanted to know.

36:14.043 --> 36:16.795
But if you ever come
near my family again...

36:16.880 --> 36:18.764
you will regret it.

36:18.849 --> 36:21.215
Who the hell you think
you're talking to, huh?

36:21.268 --> 36:23.050
- Are you threatening me?
- Yeah.

36:23.103 --> 36:24.686
Yeah, I'm threatening you.

36:24.722 --> 36:26.054
Well, that's a big mistake.

36:27.641 --> 36:29.056
You still work for me.

36:29.143 --> 36:31.726
You work for me until I say you're done.

36:31.811 --> 36:35.112
And if you ever, ever threaten me again,

36:35.199 --> 36:37.449
you're gonna be the one to regret it.

36:40.788 --> 36:42.788
Screw you, man.

37:07.648 --> 37:09.231
Taylor?

37:09.266 --> 37:11.766
I know what you're doing for Max.

37:11.818 --> 37:13.268
Be careful.

37:13.353 --> 37:14.519
I know.

37:16.773 --> 37:20.275
But I... I need your help.

37:20.360 --> 37:21.275
With what?

37:21.362 --> 37:22.945
Max wants to tell the truth.

37:23.030 --> 37:24.829
- To the police?
- Yes.

37:24.914 --> 37:26.081
No, he doesn't have to do that.

37:26.115 --> 37:29.284
That's what I said. But it's Max.

37:29.369 --> 37:31.003
He wants to do the right thing.

37:31.088 --> 37:34.789
- This is the right thing.
- I know it is.

37:34.842 --> 37:36.791
But Carter doesn't agree.

37:36.844 --> 37:39.344
Of course she doesn't.

37:39.429 --> 37:43.181
I need you to talk to her, convince her.

37:43.266 --> 37:45.349
If the three of us agree,

37:45.436 --> 37:47.802
then hopefully, Max will listen.

37:47.887 --> 37:52.023
This isn't his fault.
He was defending Carter.

37:54.894 --> 37:56.360
You know how he is.

37:58.398 --> 38:00.315
Everyone comes before him.

38:01.619 --> 38:04.987
The last thing he thinks about is himself.

38:07.875 --> 38:10.992
Please, Lori.

38:11.077 --> 38:12.577
I am begging you.

38:17.800 --> 38:19.717
Can you get her here?

38:19.802 --> 38:21.085
- I think so.
- Do it.

38:21.170 --> 38:23.338
I'll convince her.

38:26.809 --> 38:29.510
Why are you doing this?

38:29.563 --> 38:32.764
Part of being a mom is making sacrifices.

38:32.849 --> 38:34.516
Max isn't your kid.

38:35.902 --> 38:37.402
In some ways, he is.

38:41.025 --> 38:44.610
But I wasn't talking about him.

38:44.695 --> 38:46.695
I was talking about you.

38:50.784 --> 38:51.750
Thank you.

38:55.172 --> 38:56.755
Lori Stevens.

38:56.840 --> 38:58.255
Yeah?

39:00.793 --> 39:01.927
Let's go.

39:02.012 --> 39:04.096
- Where?
- You're being released.

40:01.938 --> 40:03.271
I'm sorry.
