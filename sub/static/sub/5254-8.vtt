First, you don't want to hurt Amy,

09:28.402 --> 09:31.603
then it's the school,
and now it's your family.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.104
Do you really want to be with me?

09:33.106 --> 09:35.540
Of course, I do. That's not what...

09:35.542 --> 09:37.275
Liam, can you help me get the wheat germ

09:37.277 --> 09:39.477
from the top shelf?

09:39.479 --> 09:42.613
[Sighs]

09:44.016 --> 09:46.918
Wow, what a bind.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.086
Tell our parents you're a fake lesbian

09:49.088 --> 09:51.589
or lose your boyfriend.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.658
Mom and Dad are gonna be
so disappointed to learn

09:53.660 --> 09:57.995
that Lezberry Blast was
just a flavor of the month.

09:59.059 --> 10:00.974
You made it to the finals!

10:01.000 --> 10:03.167
Okay, time to blow this [Bleep] up.

10:03.169 --> 10:04.635
After they ask you the first question,

10:04.637 --> 10:05.869
I'm gonna wait for you to say

10:05.871 --> 10:07.154
the first sentence of your speech.

10:07.180 --> 10:09.409
Beauty pageants destroy
women's sense of self-worth.

10:09.435 --> 10:10.974
Right, then I'll start our slide show

10:10.976 --> 10:13.010
of emaciated models with rotten teeth,

10:12.988 --> 10:14.803
and you'll continue your speech

10:14.829 --> 10:16.890
about the unrealistic
expectations of beauty

10:16.916 --> 10:18.749
- men put on women.
- Got it.

10:18.751 --> 10:20.918
Then you'll say, as an
out-and-proud lesbian,

10:20.920 --> 10:24.436
you could care less what men think.

10:25.256 --> 10:27.290
Uh, we did not talk about that last part.

10:27.292 --> 10:29.158
I know. Uh, I just added it.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.527
Genius, right?

10:30.529 --> 10:32.762
I gotta go load the
slide show on the laptop.

10:32.764 --> 10:34.564
You're gonna kill it.

10:34.566 --> 10:36.566
Whoo, kill it! Ugh!

10:37.868 --> 10:40.236
Oh.

10:40.238 --> 10:42.671
You look stunning.

10:42.673 --> 10:45.641
Well, you always did like me in a dress.

10:45.643 --> 10:47.676
Honey, when you entered,

10:47.678 --> 10:49.411
I thought you were
doing it just to mock me

10:49.413 --> 10:53.216
like you usually do, but I was wrong.

10:53.218 --> 10:56.818
I'm sorry I misjudged you.

10:56.820 --> 11:00.522
You know, when I found out
I was having a little girl,

11:00.524 --> 11:02.023
I was so excited.

11:02.025 --> 11:04.593
I couldn't wait to dress you in pink

11:04.595 --> 11:07.162
and go shopping and share clothes,

11:07.164 --> 11:10.366
but you were never that girl,

11:10.368 --> 11:13.935
and I had a hard time letting that go.

11:15.738 --> 11:19.274
I've wanted to connect
with you for so long.

11:19.276 --> 11:21.542
Seeing you up on that stage,

11:21.544 --> 11:24.312
it means the world to me. Thank you.

11:24.314 --> 11:27.848
And your girlfriend Reagan
seems like a lovely young woman.

11:27.850 --> 11:30.818
You should invite her
over sometime for dinner

11:30.820 --> 11:32.987
so we can get to know her better.

11:32.989 --> 11:36.023
I'd like that.

11:36.025 --> 11:37.358
Oh.

11:37.360 --> 11:40.161
Oh, don't tell Lauren,
but I'm rooting for you.

11:40.163 --> 11:41.396
[Giggling]

11:41.398 --> 11:44.098
Oh, knock 'em dead.

11:47.234 --> 11:48.707
What's the best way to deal with I.S.I.S.?

11:48.733 --> 11:49.701
- Drones.
- Russian aggression

11:49.703 --> 11:51.781
- in former Soviet Bloc countries?
- Drones.

11:51.807 --> 11:53.040
- North Korea?
- Drones. The answer is always

11:53.042 --> 11:54.342
drones. I'm not a [Bleep] idiot.

11:54.344 --> 11:55.876
Well, of course you aren't.

11:55.878 --> 11:58.122
But foreign policy isn't
exactly your strong suit,

11:58.148 --> 12:00.169
and after that evening gown debacle,

12:00.195 --> 12:01.627
we need all the points we can get.

12:01.659 --> 12:03.491
Oh! Why is it so important to you

12:03.493 --> 12:05.027
that I win this stupid pageant?

12:05.029 --> 12:07.329
Wh... Because it's important to you.

12:07.331 --> 12:09.242
Only because you've been
signing me up for pageants

12:09.268 --> 12:11.297
since I was five!

12:13.302 --> 12:15.170
The same year you found
out I was intersex.

12:15.172 --> 12:18.974
Oh, now, honey, hush. Let's
not talk about that here.

12:20.409 --> 12:24.679
All this time, I thought
you were proud of me, but...

12:24.681 --> 12:26.481
Really, you're ashamed, aren't you?

12:26.483 --> 12:28.149
Oh, baby girl, that's not true.

12:28.151 --> 12:31.219
And now, for the final
round, the interview.

12:31.221 --> 12:34.723
Thanks for the pep talk, Daddy.

12:34.725 --> 12:37.291
This is enough food to
feed my entire village.

12:37.293 --> 12:39.060
Well, ever since we
introduced baked goods,

12:39.062 --> 12:40.862
the juice truck's really taken off.

12:40.864 --> 12:42.897
Zen, I wish you could have been here

12:42.899 --> 12:46.067
when Karma and Amy were
crowned homecoming queen.

12:46.069 --> 12:49.036
They even made it onto the evening news.

12:49.038 --> 12:53.641
So, where is the other
half of this power couple?

12:55.443 --> 12:56.910
Uh...

12:56.912 --> 13:00.314
Well, you see, it's a good story.

13:00.316 --> 13:03.049
And hopefully accurate.

13:08.556 --> 13:12.159
[Sighs]

13:12.161 --> 13:15.228
I'm straight, and Liam's my boyfriend.

13:18.666 --> 13:20.033
You're kidding.

13:21.602 --> 13:24.037
Oh, dear God. Oh.

13:24.039 --> 13:26.339
Honey, what... Why would you be so cruel?

13:26.341 --> 13:29.509
Because... you've never
been as proud of me

13:29.511 --> 13:31.844
as the day I came out, and...

13:31.846 --> 13:34.681
I liked how it felt for
you to be proud of me.

13:35.849 --> 13:37.750
Lucas, what have we done?

13:37.752 --> 13:40.152
We've dimmed her inner flame.

13:40.154 --> 13:41.721
Come here, honey.

13:41.723 --> 13:44.556
- Family cuddle, come here.
- Oh, we are proud of you

13:44.558 --> 13:46.325
no matter what.

13:46.327 --> 13:49.895
But you're 100% sure
you're not even questioning?

13:49.897 --> 13:52.064
No, right, right, that's not the point.

13:52.066 --> 13:53.899
How can you let her off so easy?

13:53.901 --> 13:55.901
She's mocking the gay rights movement.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.970
It's not her fault, Zen, it's ours.

13:57.972 --> 14:00.339
We created a situation
where she wasn't comfortable

14:00.341 --> 14:03.208
being herself. Oh.

14:04.644 --> 14:05.910
[Scoffs]

14:05.912 --> 14:08.079
Well...

14:08.081 --> 14:10.749
I quit the Peace Corps. Yeah.

14:10.751 --> 14:13.819
I'm an assistant manager
at Suburban Suppliers.

14:13.821 --> 14:15.519
- [Gasps]
- In Dallas.

14:15.521 --> 14:16.754
- [Shudders]
- [Gasps]

14:16.756 --> 14:17.816
I was afraid to tell you

14:17.842 --> 14:19.900
because I thought you'd
be disappointed in me.

14:19.926 --> 14:22.359
But I just couldn't handle living

14:22.385 --> 14:25.486
with near constant diarrhea and no A.C.

14:27.499 --> 14:32.370
- Mmm.
- Oh, sweetie. Oh!

14:32.372 --> 14:34.772
All right, let's see that killer smile.

14:34.774 --> 14:36.273
Bring the chicken burger closer to you.

14:36.275 --> 14:37.441
There we go.

14:37.443 --> 14:39.477
Don't! I can't stand here

14:39.479 --> 14:40.911
and watch you do this.

14:40.913 --> 14:43.180
Cluck-n-Go is a horrible corporation

14:43.182 --> 14:45.015
that has fired gay employees

14:45.017 --> 14:48.185
and given millions of
dollars to anti-gay causes.

14:48.187 --> 14:50.453
They also give money to M.M.A. fighters,

14:50.455 --> 14:52.322
so less talkin', more eatin'.

14:52.324 --> 14:55.993
Look, if you don't want to
be a role model, I get it,

14:55.995 --> 14:58.461
but it's on a whole other
level to be the spokesman

14:58.463 --> 15:01.664
of a company that's actively
working against our rights.

15:01.666 --> 15:03.166
Son, we're not selling politics.

15:03.168 --> 15:06.035
We're selling chicken.
Eat the damn sandwich.

15:06.037 --> 15:09.105
Don't eat that homophobic sandwich.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.448
I hope you don't choke on it.

15:18.450 --> 15:22.551
I know you have a tricky gag reflex.

15:24.725 --> 15:32.428
All sides... heretofore... Sand Storm?

15:32.430 --> 15:33.829
[Light applause]

15:33.831 --> 15:35.097
Thank you, Krystal,

15:35.099 --> 15:37.766
for that illuminating answer about Syria.

15:37.768 --> 15:41.202
And now, we have Amy Raudenfeld.

15:41.204 --> 15:42.805
[Light applause]

15:42.807 --> 15:46.074
Not everyone looks on
pageants in a favorable light.

15:46.076 --> 15:48.644
What would you say to their detractors?

It's... it's a very complex issue.

16:14.636 --> 16:16.737
And I could see both sides.

16:16.739 --> 16:22.209
[Approving murmur and light applause]

16:23.479 --> 16:24.946
I'll answer that question.

16:24.948 --> 16:27.714
I'd say the detractors are right.

16:27.716 --> 16:29.616
Who wears stilettos with a bathing suit?

16:29.618 --> 16:32.219
Who tapes underwear to their butt?

16:32.221 --> 16:34.188
Is this what real girls do?

16:34.190 --> 16:35.655
And is this how we should be judged,

16:35.657 --> 16:37.191
by how pretty or girly we are?

16:37.193 --> 16:41.928
Well, I've been judged
enough, and I'm done.

16:43.465 --> 16:45.866
[Crowd gasps]

16:47.977 --> 16:50.178
Can I do my question over?

16:51.551 --> 16:53.907
Goodbye, butt tape. I
will miss you the least.

16:53.917 --> 16:55.684
- [Laughs] Wow.
- [Sighs]

16:55.686 --> 16:57.619
I did not figure you for a pageant girl.

16:58.277 --> 17:01.055
You know, there's a lot
about me you don't know.

17:04.760 --> 17:07.395
Here's the deal. I really like you,

17:07.396 --> 17:09.931
and if we're going to
have a real relationship,

17:09.933 --> 17:11.364
you need to know the real me,

17:11.390 --> 17:14.656
because I don't want to hide
who I am anymore for anybody.

17:14.904 --> 17:16.869
You're not an alien, are you?

17:16.872 --> 17:18.406
'Cause that could be a deal breaker.

17:18.407 --> 17:20.374
It's not something bad.

17:20.376 --> 17:22.976
At least, I hope that's
not the way you see it.

17:22.978 --> 17:24.711
Last time I had this
conversation with a guy,

17:24.713 --> 17:26.213
things didn't go so well.

17:31.385 --> 17:36.222
See, I'm not your average girl.

17:36.224 --> 17:38.592
We had a plan, and you
didn't follow through.

17:38.594 --> 17:39.993
Look, I couldn't do that to my mom.

17:39.995 --> 17:41.795
It literally would have killed her.

17:41.797 --> 17:43.363
You didn't introduce
me as your girlfriend,

17:43.365 --> 17:45.198
and then you didn't want
to say you're a lesbian.

17:45.200 --> 17:48.000
- Are you straight?
- No, I'm not.

17:48.002 --> 17:52.572
Where is this coming from?
You know I'm into you.

17:52.574 --> 17:57.110
I had this girlfriend
that I was crazy about.

17:57.112 --> 18:00.413
And then she dumped me
to get back with her ex...

18:00.415 --> 18:03.816
boyfriend.

18:03.818 --> 18:08.220
First, I don't have an ex-anything.

18:08.222 --> 18:11.523
And second, I'm not her.

18:11.525 --> 18:15.127
She told me I was a phase.

18:15.129 --> 18:17.697
I can't go through that again.

19:23.428 --> 19:27.230
Okay. [Chuckles]

19:27.232 --> 19:30.534
The night we broke up...

19:31.026 --> 19:33.102
I slept with somebody.

19:33.761 --> 19:35.315
It didn't... it didn't mean anything.

19:35.341 --> 19:39.006
I was hurt and upset and angry.

19:42.249 --> 19:45.314
Well, this isn't fun to hear.

19:45.316 --> 19:46.916
But we weren't together when you did it,

19:46.918 --> 19:49.318
so I can't exactly hold it against you.

was with someone I know.

It's not like it was with Amy.

20:13.549 --> 20:14.843
Get out.
