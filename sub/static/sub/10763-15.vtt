WEBVTT

00:10.210 --> 00:13.213
Large coffee to go
, please, Black,

00:13.213 --> 00:16.216
Didn't get much sleep
last night at Ronee's,

00:16.216 --> 00:19.719
Don't ask why, 'cause
there are certain things

00:19.719 --> 00:21.221
a gentleman doesn't tell,

00:21.221 --> 00:22.711
Ah,

00:24.724 --> 00:27.227
(lecherous chuckle
)

00:27.227 --> 00:28.717
Dad, please,

00:29.229 --> 00:30.730
Well, all right,
I'll tell you just a little,

00:30.730 --> 00:31.731
She's got this massage oil
...

00:31.731 --> 00:33.233
Would you stop it?

00:33.233 --> 00:35.735
I do not want to hear
about your dirty weekend,

00:35.735 --> 00:38.738
especially since the most
erotic experience I've h
ad

00:38.738 --> 00:41.104
in six months was last week'
s trouser fitting,

00:41.374 --> 00:42.442
Oh, Niles,

00:42.442 --> 00:44.144
Hi, Nile
s,

00:44.144 --> 00:46.446
The GAP, Niles?

00:46.446 --> 00:48.448
I didn't know you shopped there,

00:48.448 --> 00:50.450
I just discovered it,

00:50.450 --> 00:53.453
Apparently,
there are a number of them,

00:53.453 --> 00:55.455
And what did you get there
?
.

00:55.455 --> 00:57.157
Oh, uh,,, well, let's see,

00:57.157 --> 00:59.455
Uh,,, some wineglasses
and a bud vase,,,

01:00.160 --> 01:01.149
That's Pottery Barn,
you jackass!

01:01.461 --> 01:02.450
Give me that,

01:05.165 --> 01:07.360
Just as I thought,

01:07.534 --> 01:09.102
You bought
the Diego sweater,

01:09.102 --> 01:10.103
What's
the big de
al?

01:10.103 --> 01:11.104
It's just a sweater,

01:11.104 --> 01:12.605
It is not
just a sweater,

01:12.605 --> 01:13.594
It is a work of art

01:14.107 --> 01:16.109
by Spain's fabled
master weaver Diego,

01:16.109 --> 01:17.599
who uses only
the soft chin hairs

01:18.111 --> 01:19.601
of Andalusian mountain goats
.

01:21.114 --> 01:22.615
Our sweater man could
only get one this year,

01:22.615 --> 01:24.606
Niles and I made a pact that
neither of us would buy it,

01:25.118 --> 01:26.107
You can't even keep
a simple sweater pact!

01:26.453 --> 01:28.254
Ah, Ronee-
- there'sa gal

01:28.254 --> 01:29.556
who can keep
a sweater packed,

01:29.556 --> 01:31.257
Stop that,

01:31.257 --> 01:32.554
The least you can do
is let me borrow it sometime,

01:33.259 --> 01:35.562
Absolutely not, You know Diego'?
weave conforms precisely

01:35.562 --> 01:37.263
to the contours of one's body,

01:37.263 --> 01:39.561
Five minutes on you, I'd neverbe
able to wear it again,

01:40.266 --> 01:41.267
DAPHNE
: Hello,

01:41.267 --> 01:43.570
Oh, hi, Daph,
Hey, Daph,
Hi, Daphne,

01:43.570 --> 01:45.265
Not a word about this,

01:45.572 --> 01:47.273
We're saving money for
the baby's college fund,

01:47.273 --> 01:48.575
She'd kill me if she found out

01:48.575 --> 01:50.577
I spent half a semester
on a sweater,

01:50.577 --> 01:52.278
You want
this? Yeah,
I'm leaving,

01:52.278 --> 01:53.580
Where have you been?

01:53.580 --> 01:55.138
You missed your massage this weekend,

01:55.181 --> 01:56.773
That's what
she thinks,

01:57.283 --> 01:58.284
Just go!

01:58.284 --> 01:59.273
Have a seat,

01:59.786 --> 02:01.788
May I have a coffee?

02:01.788 --> 02:03.790
Oh, No biscotti?

02:03.790 --> 02:05.291
No, I baked me own,

02:05.291 --> 02:07.794
I decided $1, 50 was way too much
to spend on a cookie,

02:07.794 --> 02:09.294
?
.
Anyone

02:09.294 --> 02:12.287
Oh, Thank you,
my angel of thrift,

02:12.799 --> 02:13.788
Oh, hi, RoZ,

02:14.300 --> 02:15.301
Good morning,

02:15.301 --> 02:17.292
Maybe yours was,

02:17.804 --> 02:19.806
I just spent the last
two hours waiting in line

02:19.806 --> 02:22.308
for this kiddie performer
that Alice loves, Nanny G,

02:22.308 --> 02:24.799
and the second I got to the window,
the show sold out,

02:25.311 --> 02:26.801
Nanny G? Frasier
might be able

02:27.313 --> 02:29.315
to pull a few strings for you there,

02:29.315 --> 02:30.304
You know Nanny G?

02:30.817 --> 02:32.318
What did you,
like, date her?

02:32.318 --> 02:34.809
Actually, I married her,

02:35.321 --> 02:37.551
You married Nanny G?

02:37.891 --> 02:39.492
Yeah, Well, briefly,
It was years ago,

02:39.492 --> 02:41.483
I was a callow, dreamy-eyed
youth, and she was,,,

02:42.195 --> 02:43.496
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I need tickets.

02:43.496 --> 02:45.487
She's at Kidbooks right now
signing her new CD,

02:46.199 --> 02:47.200
If you come with me,,,

02:47.200 --> 02:48.501
All right,
all right,

02:48.501 --> 02:49.502
I'll see what I can do,

02:49.502 --> 02:50.503
Thank you,

02:50.503 --> 02:52.205
Oh, and could you turn

02:52.205 --> 02:53.194
the heat up in here?
It's freeZing,

02:53.506 --> 02:56.209
Oh, Niles has a sweater,

02:56.209 --> 02:59.201
Oh, and it's from
the GAP, Good boy,

02:59.512 --> 03:02.515
Now, help me stretch
the neck out,

03:02.515 --> 03:05.507
I don't want
to muss me hair,

03:13.393 --> 03:14.883
Thank you, Nanny G,

03:16.396 --> 03:18.887
So what was it like
being married to Nanny G?

03:19.399 --> 03:22.391
Oh, gosh, We weree,
so young and immatur

03:22.835 --> 03:24.904
We'd have huge fights
over nothing,

03:24.904 --> 03:26.394
But in the bedroom,,,

03:26.773 --> 03:28.274
Uh, Frasier,,,

03:28.274 --> 03:29.935
Oh, sorry,

03:30.310 --> 03:33.677
So, um,,, Nanny G
gave you nice "hugs"?

03:34.280 --> 03:35.645
Oh, big hugs,

03:37.650 --> 03:38.651
No kiddin'?

03:38.651 --> 03:42.355
.
We used to hug
our brains out

03:42.355 --> 03:43.656
In fact, you know,

03:43.656 --> 03:45.358
the last time
we saw each other,

03:45.358 --> 03:47.360
she wanted to have
a little reunion hug,

03:47.360 --> 03:49.662
But, alas,
I was stillmarried to Lilith

03:49.662 --> 03:51.653
and settling for
my weekly handshake,

03:55.902 --> 03:57.470
So, you're hoping
for another hug?

03:57.470 --> 03:59.461
Oh, the thought
had crossed my mind, you know

03:59.973 --> 04:02.475
We used to have
this wild attraction
to each other,

04:02.475 --> 04:03.339
It was almost combustible,

04:03.743 --> 04:05.711
Truth be told,

04:06.045 --> 04:07.614
while
it's been a

04:07.614 --> 04:11.311
since I, uh,,,
romped with abandon

04:11.618 --> 04:14.314
through the perfumed
gardens of Eros,

04:16.255 --> 04:19.656
Next time you say something
like that, covermyears,

04:22.060 --> 04:23.892
And who is this for?
Frasier,

04:24.330 --> 04:25.698
F-R-A,,,

04:25.698 --> 04:28.690
Frasier! Oh!
It's so good to see you again!

04:29.002 --> 04:30.469
And you--
you look great,

04:30.670 --> 04:32.638
I've never seen such col
or in your cheeks,

04:32.939 --> 04:35.407
Oh, this isn't Lilith,

04:35.575 --> 04:38.645
This is my coworker, RoZ,
and her daughter, Alice,

04:38.645 --> 04:40.647
Hey, Alice,
How old are you?

04:40.647 --> 04:41.648
now,
I'm divorced

04:41.648 --> 04:42.649
Five,

04:42.649 --> 04:43.650
Wow, Five!

04:43.650 --> 04:45.345
Single again,

04:45.518 --> 04:47.577
You know what happens
when you turn six?

04:48.288 --> 04:49.346
You grow an extra finger,

04:49.589 --> 04:51.557
Footloose, fancy free,

04:51.858 --> 04:53.416
She's not biting,
Just get the tickets,

04:53.926 --> 04:54.688
All right,

04:54.961 --> 04:56.029
You know,
Nanette, Alice

04:56.029 --> 04:58.031
was so hoping
to see your show,

04:58.031 --> 05:00.397
but, alas,
all the tickets are sold,

05:00.633 --> 05:02.726
Well, I think
I can scare up three seats,

05:03.403 --> 05:05.064
if you don't mind sitting
in the front row,

05:05.438 --> 05:07.507
Thank you, Nanny G!

05:07.507 --> 05:09.873
Can I have everyone's attention?

05:10.109 --> 05:13.408
Nanny G has to go
to the theater now,

05:13.680 --> 05:15.409
so no more autographs,

05:15.682 --> 05:18.310
Gosh, I'm sorry, But maybe
we have time for one more thing.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.420
Would you like
to hear a song?

05:20.420 --> 05:21.888
(kids cheering)

05:21.888 --> 05:23.446
Does everyone know

05:23.656 --> 05:25.123
"The Peek-a-Boo Song?

05:25.358 --> 05:26.426
Yeah!

05:26.426 --> 05:28.485
Well, then, you
know what to do!

05:29.562 --> 05:30.494
Peek-a-boo

05:30.563 --> 05:31.325
Peek-a-boo

05:31.631 --> 05:32.532
Peek-a-boo

05:32.532 --> 05:33.965
Peek-a-boo

05:34.334 --> 05:35.735
Someone's there,
but, oh, my gosh

05:35.735 --> 05:37.437
I don't know who

05:37.437 --> 05:38.426
Is it you?

05:38.571 --> 05:40.038
KIDS:
Peek-a-boo
Give a clue

05:40.406 --> 05:41.373
Peek-a-boo

05:41.708 --> 05:44.477
Guess I better go
and sneak a peek-a-boo

05:44.477 --> 05:45.478
ALL:
Peek-a-boo

05:45.478 --> 05:48.447
That was great!

05:50.483 --> 05:51.882
.
so I want everyone
to cover your eyes

05:52.352 --> 05:55.480
Ah-ah-ah! I said everyone,

05:57.857 --> 05:59.449
KIDS:

05:59.926 --> 06:01.427

06:02.562 --> 06:05.131
But, oh, my gosh,
I don't know who

06:05.131 --> 06:07.122
Is it you?
Peek-a-boo

06:07.567 --> 06:09.501
Here's a clue
Peek-a-boo

06:09.869 --> 06:12.438
Guess I better go
and sneak a peek-a-boo

06:12.438 --> 06:14.929
Peek-a-boo

06:18.811 --> 06:21.507
One more time!

06:23.916 --> 06:24.917
Oh, hi, you guys,
Hey,

06:24.917 --> 06:25.906
I'm glad
you're both here,

06:26.419 --> 06:28.410
Guess who's coming by
for a drink,

06:28.921 --> 06:30.479
Nanette GuZman,

06:30.556 --> 06:32.125
Nanny G,
I don't suppose

06:32.125 --> 06:33.126
she's brink,
ging her checkboo

06:33.126 --> 06:34.991
Oh, dear God, Dad,

06:35.461 --> 06:36.553
will you let it go?

06:36.796 --> 06:37.864
I was still paying
for that wedding

06:37.864 --> 06:39.456
six months
after you two divorced,

06:41.100 --> 06:43.534
Nanette didn't have any family
so she got off scot-free,

06:43.770 --> 06:45.829
Oh, yeah, orphans get
all the breaks,

06:47.840 --> 06:49.842
Hey, Frasier, Dad and Ronee
are joining us for dinner,

06:49.842 --> 06:50.831
Why don't you two
come along?

06:51.210 --> 06:52.768
Well, actually, Niles,
I'm planning

06:53.446 --> 06:55.004
a bit of an intimate
evening myself,

06:55.448 --> 06:56.415
Really?

06:56.582 --> 06:58.641
me,
She wants

06:59.118 --> 07:00.620
Are you sure?
You said that last week

07:00.620 --> 07:04.590
about the cable lady, and she
just had something in her eye,

07:04.590 --> 07:07.960
She hit on me
in the children's bookstore

07:07.960 --> 07:09.462
where I bought her CD,

07:09.462 --> 07:12.863
Trust me, the woman
is a sexual volcano

07:13.433 --> 07:14.801
about to erupt,

07:14.801 --> 07:16.803
NILES:
Judging from some
of these song titles,

07:16.803 --> 07:17.804
you may be right,

07:17.804 --> 07:21.474
"Nanny's Messy Bed",,,

07:21.474 --> 07:25.578
"I Feel Something Great
Inside Me",,,

07:25.578 --> 07:28.445
"Banisters Are Fun, "

07:31.117 --> 07:33.653
h,
Hey,
Hey, Dap

07:33.653 --> 07:34.654
My sweater--

07:34.654 --> 07:36.645
weren't you wearing it
when you went out?

07:37.156 --> 07:38.646
Yeah, but Eddie was pulling me
along so fast

07:39.158 --> 07:41.661
I started sweating
like a blacksmith,

07:41.661 --> 07:43.925
I could smell the lamb curry
I had for lunch just wafting
out my pores,

07:44.163 --> 07:46.232
But don't worry--
it's right here,

07:46.232 --> 07:48.223
Oh, great,

07:48.734 --> 07:50.236
That was me
last butterscotch,

07:50.236 --> 07:51.225
Now it's all fuZZy,

07:52.638 --> 07:54.503
(doorbell rings)

07:54.941 --> 07:57.000
That'll be Nanette,

08:00.980 --> 08:02.470
Nanette,

08:05.685 --> 08:09.143
God, I could throw you down
on this floor right now
and,,, Hi!

08:09.622 --> 08:11.249
Hello,

08:11.524 --> 08:12.616

08:13.092 --> 08:13.956
Isn't she?
the children's entertainer

08:14.494 --> 08:17.563
Yeah, SpongeBob Hotpants,

08:17.563 --> 08:20.132
Nanette, you remember my dad,
of course, and-and Niles,

08:20.132 --> 08:21.690
And this
is his wife, Daphne,

08:23.169 --> 08:25.171
Hello, It's nice
to meet you,
Oh, it's nice

08:25.171 --> 08:26.672
to meet you, too,

08:26.672 --> 08:29.175
Oh, I don't think I've seen
since the wedding,

08:29.175 --> 08:30.665
Oh, I remember that day,

08:31.177 --> 08:32.678
All those nice
friends of yours came,

08:32.678 --> 08:34.679
What was it, 60, 70?

08:34.679 --> 08:35.544
It's okay, Dad,

08:35.914 --> 08:38.683
I know because
only 50 RSVP'ed,

08:38.683 --> 08:39.844
FRASIER:
It's all right,,,

08:40.186 --> 08:42.722
You know, sadly, this bunch
is going out this evening,

08:42.722 --> 08:44.713
so it'll just be
the two of us,

08:45.224 --> 08:46.623
(knocking)
Hey,

08:46.859 --> 08:48.594
.
And Donald

08:48.594 --> 08:49.583
Donald?

08:49.829 --> 08:51.864
Put 'er there,
Don Burwell,

Frasier Crane, uh,,,

08:53.866 --> 08:54.855

NANNY G :
Donald here does, well

08:55.167 --> 08:56.235
just about everything
for me,

08:56.235 --> 08:58.226
He's my manager,
producer, songwriter,

08:58.538 --> 08:59.869
publicist,,,
Husband,

09:00.172 --> 09:01.605
I was getting there,

09:01.841 --> 09:03.676
And when I told him where I was going, well,

09:03.676 --> 09:06.212
he just had to come along
to meet you,

09:06.212 --> 09:07.246
FRASIER:
Well, uh,,,

09:07.246 --> 09:09.315
Gosh, w-who wants wine?

09:09.315 --> 09:11.317
I know I do,

09:11.317 --> 09:14.720
I'll help, Donald,
 introduce yourself

09:14.720 --> 09:16.889
Hello, Donald,

09:16.889 --> 09:19.926
Just when were you
planning on telling me you have a husband?

09:19.926 --> 09:22.194
He produces my show,
It's a marriage
of convenience,

09:22.194 --> 09:23.252
Not at the moment, it's not,

09:23.596 --> 09:25.164
Come on, give Nanny
some sugar,

09:25.164 --> 09:26.666
Stop-stop it, stop it,

09:26.666 --> 09:27.655
.
Donald will see us

09:28.167 --> 09:29.168
We'll say that you're short
on something

09:29.168 --> 09:31.671
and send him to the store--
he's good at errands,

09:31.671 --> 09:33.673
I'm not going to
send him on an errand,

09:33.673 --> 09:35.732
He's your husband,
It's just business,

09:35.908 --> 09:37.643
It's nothing
like what we had,

09:37.643 --> 09:40.947
Do you remember the passion,,,
and the wildness?

09:40.947 --> 09:44.644
Well, we are running
low on cornichons,

09:44.817 --> 09:46.910
Not only did we break house records in Boise

09:47.186 --> 09:49.255
and Topeka, but she hasn'?
missed a show,

09:49.255 --> 09:52.622
She just,,, she lives
to entertain children,

09:52.959 --> 09:55.027
Of all ages,

09:55.027 --> 09:58.724
Don, come out and look
at the balcony,

09:58.931 --> 10:00.967
Dear God!

10:00.967 --> 10:02.668
Have we lost our minds ?

10:02.668 --> 10:04.971
Frasier, if you knew
how bored I am

10:04.971 --> 10:07.673
being Nanny G,,,

10:07.673 --> 10:09.675
how trapped I feel,

10:09.675 --> 10:10.977
You have a wonderful career,

10:10.977 --> 10:12.968
But nothing ever changes,

10:13.279 --> 10:14.880
Do you have any idea
what it's like

10:14.880 --> 10:17.849
to play the same character
for 20 years?

10:24.857 --> 10:29.862
But,,, you've brought joy to-to countless
small children,

10:29.862 --> 10:31.227
Yeah, well,,,

10:31.731 --> 10:33.132
there are times
you want to bring joy

10:33.132 --> 10:35.835
to somebody big enough
to throw a little back at you,

10:35.835 --> 10:38.133
Stop-stop it!

10:39.705 --> 10:40.694
Who wants wine?

10:41.007 --> 10:42.736
Oh, that'll cool her
right down,

10:43.009 --> 10:45.745
Uh, none for us,
We really have to go,

10:45.745 --> 10:47.906
Yeah, Uh, nice
to meet you, Donald,

10:48.147 --> 10:49.739
and, uh, Fras, see
you in a few hours

10:50.149 --> 10:52.985
So, looks like
a threesome tonight,

10:52.985 --> 10:56.944
Maybe I'll just stay
at Ronee's,

10:57.156 --> 10:59.692
Yes, well, uh,,,

10:59.692 --> 11:01.182
)
(clears throat

11:01.694 --> 11:02.695
Here we all are,

11:02.695 --> 11:04.196
(chuckling)

11:04.196 --> 11:07.700
(phone rings, playing
"Peek-a-boo")

11:07.700 --> 11:09.702
Hello,

11:09.702 --> 11:11.192
Ar-Are you sure?

11:12.705 --> 11:15.196
Mr, Bunny's using again,

11:17.910 --> 11:19.468
Do you have anyone
to replace him?

11:19.945 --> 11:20.946
Donald, we a
re guests here,

11:20.946 --> 11:21.935
Take that outside,

11:22.448 --> 11:23.949
HonestIy,

11:23.949 --> 11:25.439
.
The man has no manners

11:30.356 --> 11:31.857
Cut that out!

11:31.857 --> 11:33.359
I can't help myself,

11:33.359 --> 11:34.792
I've never stopped
thinking about you

11:34.894 --> 11:36.929
Nor I you, but
this is wrong,

11:36.929 --> 11:38.931
Oh, Frasier,
you're so good,

11:38.931 --> 11:40.796
You always do
the right thing,

11:41.033 --> 11:43.126
I have the exact
same problem,

11:43.502 --> 11:45.738
(panting)

11:45.738 --> 11:48.901
Well, you're making
great strides overcoming it,

11:49.208 --> 11:50.869
Well, I'm tired of being good,

11:51.043 --> 11:54.780
I've sung my songs
and cheered people up,

11:54.780 --> 11:56.771
Haven't I earned the right
to be a little bad?

11:57.016 --> 11:59.752
Isn't there a part of you
that wants to be bad?

11:59.752 --> 12:03.756
Yes, and three guesses
which one,

12:03.756 --> 12:06.418
I-I,,, I can't do it,

12:06.826 --> 12:08.919
Come to my dressing room
after the show tomorrow,

12:09.228 --> 12:10.930
I have an hour
when Donald's busy,

12:10.930 --> 12:11.931
..
I know an hour's not much,

12:11.931 --> 12:13.933
Trust me, an hour's
more than ample,

12:13.933 --> 12:14.797
Shh, Shh,

12:16.435 --> 12:20.439
Well, I just hope he
shows up tomorrow,

12:20.439 --> 12:23.943
That bunny suit is jus
t so darn tight on me,

12:23.943 --> 12:27.435
Donald, you know,
you really must try

12:27.947 --> 12:29.448
one of these Gruyre tarts,

12:29.448 --> 12:30.449
Oh, no, thanks,

12:30.449 --> 12:31.939
I'm watching
the old cholesterol,

12:32.384 --> 12:33.419
NANETTE:
So am I, but you know what?

12:33.419 --> 12:35.853
I just feel like
being bad tonight,

12:35.955 --> 12:37.490
What about you,
Frasier?

12:37.490 --> 12:39.492
Are you going
to be bad?

12:39.492 --> 12:41.983
DONALD:
Ah, go on,

12:42.428 --> 12:44.020
What's one little tart?

12:46.000 --> 12:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:57.309 --> 13:00.312
Mmm, Well, it
shows its face

13:00.312 --> 13:01.313
?
.
What was t
hat last night

13:01.313 --> 13:02.815
Relax, relax,
Nothing happened,

13:02.815 --> 13:05.317
My problem now is that,,,

13:05.317 --> 13:07.808
she's invited me
to her dressing room

13:08.320 --> 13:10.311
for an aprs-show tryst,

13:10.823 --> 13:11.924
You're not going?

13:11.924 --> 13:12.925
Well,,,

13:12.925 --> 13:13.926
Frasier,

13:13.926 --> 13:15.917
Niles, if you had
any idea

13:16.228 --> 13:17.930
how much pain she's in,

13:17.930 --> 13:20.232
The woman is
reaching out to me

13:20.232 --> 13:22.935
to rescue her
from a loveless marriage,

13:22.935 --> 13:26.939
from,,, from a career
she feels trapped in,

13:26.939 --> 13:28.930
If I could help her
make a new beginning,

13:29.241 --> 13:32.244
wouldn't it be heartless
of me to deny myself to her?

13:32.244 --> 13:33.946
Did you say something?

13:33.946 --> 13:36.244
hear,
Your penis was talking
so loud, I couldn't

13:40.252 --> 13:41.253
All right!

13:41.253 --> 13:43.255
I want her and she wants me!

13:43.255 --> 13:44.957
She's married,

13:44.957 --> 13:46.948
Yes, well,
I married her first,

13:48.961 --> 13:50.963
Till death us do part,
as I recall,

13:50.963 --> 13:53.955
Now, you may not take
those vows seriously, but I do,

13:54.266 --> 13:56.268
Will you listen to yourself?

13:56.268 --> 13:58.971
Oh, this is more than
just sex, Niles,

13:58.971 --> 14:00.973
This is passion, kismet,

14:00.973 --> 14:04.977
a gift the gods bestow
on only a chosen few,

14:04.977 --> 14:07.969
Wouldn't the real sin
be to refuse it?

14:08.280 --> 14:11.984
Isn't that your old
second-piece-of-pie argument?

14:11.984 --> 14:13.986
Well, maybe it is,

14:13.986 --> 14:17.990
but I haven't had "pie"
in six months,

14:17.990 --> 14:20.288
Frasier, you can rationaliZe
this any way you want,

14:20.993 --> 14:22.294
but the real question is,

14:22.294 --> 14:25.229
if you do this, can you live
with yourself afterwards?

14:28.901 --> 14:29.902
Ready for
the concert?

14:29.902 --> 14:30.891
.
Hey, Alice

14:31.203 --> 14:32.192
Hi, Uncle Niles,

14:32.905 --> 14:33.200
.
Hi

14:33.906 --> 14:34.907
Come on, Mommy,
Let's go,

14:34.907 --> 14:37.205
Oh, oh, oh, no hugs
for Frasier?

14:41.914 --> 14:43.211
No,,,

14:46.919 --> 14:48.910
No hugs for Frasier,

14:55.494 --> 14:56.893
(knock at door)

14:59.031 --> 15:02.034
Frasier, I thought you
were coming after the show,

15:02.034 --> 15:03.335
No, I can't,

15:03.335 --> 15:04.336
Well, we have ten minutes,

15:04.336 --> 15:06.038
Let me just get rid of,,,
Donald!

15:06.038 --> 15:07.039
Huh?

15:07.039 --> 15:10.042
.
No, no, I can'
t do this at all

15:10.042 --> 15:10.906
What?

15:11.143 --> 15:11.734
Huh?

15:12.177 --> 15:14.179
Nothing,
Just sit there,

15:14.179 --> 15:17.182
.
God knows I'm temp
ted, but,,, this is wrong

15:17.182 --> 15:20.185
I-I'm sorry you've
been so unhappy in you
r life lately, but,,,

15:20.185 --> 15:23.188
If you want to talk,
we can meet later

15:23.188 --> 15:25.190
at the coffee shop next door,

15:25.190 --> 15:27.192
Why can't we talk now?

15:27.192 --> 15:28.694
?
.
Don't you
have a show to do

15:28.694 --> 15:30.195
They can't start
without me,

15:30.195 --> 15:32.186
Here, come with me,

15:39.204 --> 15:40.706
What is this place?

15:40.706 --> 15:42.207
It's the prop room,

15:42.207 --> 15:43.709
This is where I come
before every show

15:43.709 --> 15:45.700
to fight off the emptiness
and the nausea

15:46.211 --> 15:47.713
that comes over me,

15:47.713 --> 15:50.716
You don't know how many time
s I've sat down here,

15:50.716 --> 15:53.708
curled up in a ball
vomiting like a wino,

15:56.221 --> 15:58.724
Hold me, Frasier,

15:58.724 --> 16:01.226
I can't,

16:01.226 --> 16:03.228
You're married,

16:03.228 --> 16:05.219
And these shoe
s are suede,

16:08.233 --> 16:11.236
Look, I-I realiZe that you'r
e at a crossroads right now,

16:11.236 --> 16:14.239
and if I can help you
reach some decision,,,

16:14.239 --> 16:15.729
,
I can't go on,
Then don'?

16:16.241 --> 16:17.743
Make a break,
Redefine yourself,

16:17.743 --> 16:19.244
No, I mean now, this show,

16:19.244 --> 16:20.245
I can't go on,
What?

16:20.245 --> 16:21.747
Cancel?

16:21.747 --> 16:23.749
I can't go out there
and sing and dance

16:23.749 --> 16:25.284
and pretend to be
a happy lady

16:25.284 --> 16:27.275
when the love of my life
has just rejected me,

16:33.759 --> 16:37.763
Oh, Nanette, I,,, I realiZe
you're upset, but-but,,,

16:37.763 --> 16:41.133
think of little Alice
and-and the children,

16:41.133 --> 16:42.430
Oh, let them learn now

16:43.135 --> 16:46.138
that life is filled
with bitter disappointments,

16:46.138 --> 16:47.127
But, Nanette,,,

16:47.373 --> 16:49.432
Oh, make me
a happy lady, Frasier,

16:50.075 --> 16:51.064
And then I can go on,

16:52.378 --> 16:53.367
For the children!

17:02.087 --> 17:03.088
Okay,

17:03.088 --> 17:04.077
All right,

17:08.093 --> 17:09.395
Take me, Frasier!

17:09.395 --> 17:11.396
Yes! Yes!

17:11.396 --> 17:12.397
Oh!

17:12.397 --> 17:14.098
Oh, God!

17:14.098 --> 17:15.401
How I've dreamed of this moment!

17:15.401 --> 17:16.402
Have you?!

17:16.402 --> 17:17.403
Are you kidding?

17:17.403 --> 17:19.394
I dreamed of it
twice last night,

17:22.207 --> 17:23.776
Oh, my God!

17:23.776 --> 17:24.777
Already?

17:24.777 --> 17:25.778
Oh, no!

17:25.778 --> 17:27.279
I thought we
had more time,

17:27.279 --> 17:28.781
!
.
Quick, get off the bed

17:28.781 --> 17:29.915
Oh, dear God!

17:29.915 --> 17:31.382
Why is the ceiling
opening up?

17:31.583 --> 17:32.584
!
.
This is how
I make my entrance

17:32.584 --> 17:34.086
Get off the bed!

17:34.086 --> 17:35.587
I can't, I can't,
I'm tangled in the sheets,

17:35.587 --> 17:36.451
Jump!

17:36.922 --> 17:38.424
Jump? It's too high,

17:38.424 --> 17:40.119
Aim for your clothes,

17:40.225 --> 17:41.794
Dear God, my clothes!

17:41.794 --> 17:44.285
Oh, hide! For God'
s sake, just hide!

17:46.498 --> 17:48.557
(cheering)

17:53.472 --> 17:54.803
You have got to get
out of this bed,

17:55.140 --> 17:57.199
Can't I just hide here
until the show's over?

17:57.476 --> 17:59.910
Trust me,
that ain't gonna work,

18:00.279 --> 18:02.144
(cheering)

18:07.186 --> 18:09.488
When it's time to rise

18:09.488 --> 18:11.190
I yawn and rub my eyes

18:11.190 --> 18:14.353
Because I'm such
a sleepyhead

18:14.860 --> 18:17.362
But rise I do

18:17.362 --> 18:19.364
'Cause I'm dying to see what's new

18:19.364 --> 18:22.356
In Nanny's messy bed

18:22.868 --> 18:25.598
There might be treats

18:25.938 --> 18:27.235
Last week I found a piZZa

18:27.439 --> 18:30.676
And a chimpanZee named Fred

18:30.676 --> 18:33.512
So, kids, what say

18:33.512 --> 18:35.207
We see what we find today

18:35.514 --> 18:38.881
In Nanny's messy bed

18:39.318 --> 18:41.820
There's always
something new

18:41.820 --> 18:43.185
It's Mr, Kangaroo?

18:43.522 --> 18:44.955
Some bunny rabbits, too

18:45.324 --> 18:47.292
And a Panda

18:51.463 --> 18:52.452
Psst, Panda,

18:52.865 --> 18:53.832
Who the hell are you?

18:54.233 --> 18:55.734
Dr, Frasier Crane,
a noted psychiatrist,

18:55.734 --> 18:58.328
When does the bed
go back to the basement?

19:00.873 --> 19:01.862
Fast,

19:04.409 --> 19:07.845
What a mess, what a mess

19:08.280 --> 19:10.908
What a messy, messy,
messy, messy bed

19:12.251 --> 19:13.752
What a mess

19:13.752 --> 19:16.346
Nonetheless

19:16.522 --> 19:19.224
With all the time
I spend in it

19:19.224 --> 19:20.384
It's nice to have
a friend in it

19:20.859 --> 19:22.528
You have got to get
me out of here,

19:22.528 --> 19:24.894
This thing's about
to fly up to the rafters,

19:25.330 --> 19:26.331
Gee, I didn't know that,

19:26.331 --> 19:28.333
having only done this show
12, 000 times,

19:28.333 --> 19:30.665
Put this on,

19:30.903 --> 19:32.336
You can't be serious,

19:32.738 --> 19:33.796
Just put it on now!

19:34.273 --> 19:38.369
Messy bed,

19:41.380 --> 19:43.848
(cheering)

19:44.283 --> 19:46.385
Oh, hi, boys and girls,

19:46.385 --> 19:49.548
ALL:
Hi, Nanny G,

19:49.955 --> 19:51.456
Well, I guess
I'd better make my bed,

19:51.456 --> 19:52.718
You don't have
to, Nanny G,

19:53.058 --> 19:55.260
I have a magic wand that can
make it fly away

19:55.260 --> 19:56.562
until it's nighttime again,

19:56.562 --> 19:57.426
AlakaZ,,,

19:57.729 --> 19:59.731
Wait!

19:59.731 --> 20:03.402
I think there's something in
there that I haven't found yet

20:03.402 --> 20:04.403
(gasps)

20:04.403 --> 20:05.904
It's the best surprise ever,

20:05.904 --> 20:06.632
It's,,,

20:06.972 --> 20:10.032
a new baby brother!

20:15.547 --> 20:17.481
(laughter)

20:20.719 --> 20:22.387
Oh, what's the matter,
little guy?

20:22.387 --> 20:23.388
You look kind of sad,

20:23.388 --> 20:24.377
Are you going to cry?

20:24.656 --> 20:26.358
( whispers ) Cry,

20:26.358 --> 20:27.359
Waa!

20:27.359 --> 20:28.927
Oh,,,

20:28.927 --> 20:31.896
NANETTE:
Sounds like somebody
could use some cheering up,

20:32.097 --> 20:34.429
Let's sing him
the "Hoppity-Hop" song,

20:34.633 --> 20:36.401
We cut "Hoppity-Hop"
in Detroit,

20:36.401 --> 20:37.993
Put it back in,

20:40.939 --> 20:42.930
When I'm blue
just like you

20:43.408 --> 20:45.535
When it's not my day

20:45.844 --> 20:48.506
I hop, hop, hoppity-hop

20:48.614 --> 20:50.616
Hop my troubles away

20:50.616 --> 20:52.284
Come on!

20:52.284 --> 20:54.275
ALL:
When a bee stings my knee?

20:54.620 --> 20:56.611
When I lose a toy

20:57.289 --> 20:59.291
I hop, hop, hoppity-hop

20:59.291 --> 21:01.350
And soon I'm jumping for jo

21:01.660 --> 21:04.629
We were feeling sad

21:04.796 --> 21:07.356
Now we're feeling snapp

21:07.799 --> 21:10.302
We were hopping mad

21:10.302 --> 21:12.804
Now we're hopping happy

21:12.804 --> 21:15.068
So when you think
people stink

21:15.274 --> 21:17.868
Let your knees just bend

21:18.377 --> 21:20.979
And hop, hop, hoppity-hop

21:20.979 --> 21:23.948
And watch
your grumpiness end

21:24.149 --> 21:26.413
Hop, hop, hoppity-hop

21:27.305 --> 21:33.784
