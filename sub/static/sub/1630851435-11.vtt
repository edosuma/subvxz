WEBVTT

01:44.979 --> 01:48.399
So, you want a match with him,
do you, Mister?

01:49.150 --> 01:53.488
Why would you think I want a match?

01:54.405 --> 01:58.118
No one doubts your strength

01:58.743 --> 02:03.581
but what Baki did the other day,
walking out the front gate…

02:04.249 --> 02:07.377
it had a tremendous effect on the inmates.

02:09.462 --> 02:11.840
For a little outing?

02:11.923 --> 02:14.843
I don't want to say this, but…

02:20.265 --> 02:21.349
Say it.

02:25.019 --> 02:30.859
Baki going out is different
from when you or Guevaru go out.

02:30.942 --> 02:35.113
When you or Guevaru go out,
it's due to the strength of your position.

02:35.196 --> 02:38.491
With Baki, on the other hand…

02:40.952 --> 02:44.372
Are you suggesting
the kid's strength is more pure?

02:44.455 --> 02:49.169
Oh, no. I'm not saying that.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.880
That's just the rumor that's going around.

02:51.963 --> 02:54.007
Shall I show them?

02:54.090 --> 02:56.885
What a walk out the front gate looks like?

02:56.968 --> 02:59.888
This is why I didn't want to say anything!

02:59.971 --> 03:05.101
If you attempted that,
not even the Marines could stop you.

03:08.229 --> 03:14.402
I hear the President
is quite the fan of martial arts.

03:15.069 --> 03:17.906
Send him an invitation.

03:17.989 --> 03:20.658
Put out a press release.

03:23.244 --> 03:25.663
Our very own Arizona State Prison

03:25.788 --> 03:30.752
will put on a great fighting sports event
and broadcast it to the world.

03:30.835 --> 03:31.669
I see.

03:31.753 --> 03:37.300
The legend, Biscuit Oliva,
the strongest man in America,

03:37.383 --> 03:42.847
takes on Baki Hanma,
the strongest boy in history.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.682
Oh wow!

03:45.516 --> 03:47.852
We'll sell the rights to cable television

03:48.353 --> 03:51.439
and broadcast it throughout America.

03:51.522 --> 03:53.441
Wonderful!

03:54.192 --> 03:58.446
It'll have a much better economic effect

03:58.529 --> 04:01.574
than having inmates dig roads.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.451
Wonderful!

04:09.123 --> 04:10.583
I'm envious.

04:12.543 --> 04:13.586
Of who?

04:15.922 --> 04:21.469
You used to have a beauty
that turned every head in town.

04:22.220 --> 04:26.975
Then you fell sick,
and after taking countless medications,

04:27.058 --> 04:29.185
you came to look as you do today.

04:30.311 --> 04:35.858
You've lost your beauty,
a woman's greatest joy in life.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.486
But, look at you.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.989
You're unwavering.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.242
As haughty as you ever were.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.495
As uninhibited as you ever were.

04:47.578 --> 04:50.248
As dignified as you ever were.

04:50.832 --> 04:55.253
Living proudly, without changing a thing.

04:55.336 --> 04:57.505
I'm just shameless.

04:57.588 --> 04:59.424
You'd probably…

05:00.174 --> 05:01.259
Come here.

05:01.843 --> 05:05.972
…remain dignified, even if
the whole world were to abandon you--

05:06.055 --> 05:08.016
Just come here.

05:08.599 --> 05:11.853
I don't think I have the right--

05:12.353 --> 05:15.523
Are you going to make
a lady repeat herself thrice?

05:19.736 --> 05:23.865
Darling, even I'm just barely holding on.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.385
I'll give you what you want.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.180
In two weeks.

05:47.930 --> 05:50.933
All of America will know your name.

05:51.017 --> 05:54.395
You just don't get it, Mr. Chained.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.648
Are you going senile, Chained?

05:58.358 --> 06:02.820
So, you think I'm chained?

06:03.404 --> 06:06.449
All I want to do is fight you.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.951
I don't need two weeks for anything.

06:09.827 --> 06:11.037
What do you mean?

06:12.538 --> 06:14.207
I mean this.

06:16.125 --> 06:21.214
If either you or I move.
Then, like it or not,

06:21.839 --> 06:23.716
it'll start then and there.

06:23.800 --> 06:27.220
You want to start it right here?

06:27.804 --> 06:30.473
You're not a true fighter.

06:31.265 --> 06:34.102
It's a fight between just you and me.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.480
Why does anyone else need to see?

06:38.064 --> 06:39.732
Don't you get it?

06:39.816 --> 06:44.278
Right now,
both of your thumbs are cuffed together.

06:44.362 --> 06:47.740
You plan on fighting me in that condition?

06:47.824 --> 06:50.993
I'm the one picking this fight. Plus--

06:57.834 --> 07:00.336
I'm not as shackled as you.

07:01.754 --> 07:05.007
Is that what I look like to you?

07:05.091 --> 07:08.261
Yeah, pitifully shackled.

07:08.344 --> 07:10.263
I'm not talking about that.

07:10.346 --> 07:15.184
I'm asking you, do I look like someone
you can beat without both hands?

07:22.108 --> 07:24.152
Do you get it, Mister?

07:24.235 --> 07:27.280
This is not the time
to be worried about how you look.

07:29.782 --> 07:33.286
Sorry about that. I'm up to speed now.

07:40.418 --> 07:41.461
Oh, boss!

07:42.462 --> 07:44.547
I was wrong.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.550
The match starts now.

07:49.635 --> 07:52.138
You're certainly the son of the Ogre.

07:52.889 --> 07:56.559
So earnest about fighting.

07:57.393 --> 07:59.103
I was wrong.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.689
It's as you say.

08:01.772 --> 08:04.066
I wasn't a true fighter.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.320
Forgive me.

08:13.993 --> 08:15.328
Sorry to keep you waiting.

08:17.413 --> 08:19.832
Now that you're finally awake,

08:20.458 --> 08:23.336
I can't fight like this.

08:29.425 --> 08:32.386
Ah, so, you're less constrained,

08:32.970 --> 08:35.348
but that won't be quite enough.

08:35.431 --> 08:36.724
Oh, shut up.

08:41.437 --> 08:42.355
I see.

08:42.980 --> 08:47.068
The blood in the arms
goes in through the inner arteries,

08:47.151 --> 08:50.363
and goes to the torso
through the outer veins.

08:51.072 --> 08:55.952
This is why you hold something in your
armpit when you have a hand injury,

08:56.035 --> 08:59.372
to stop the bleeding
by cutting off the inner arteries.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.125
With lats as developed as yours, Baki,

09:03.209 --> 09:08.673
the artery can be cut off
without holding anything in the armpit.

09:09.966 --> 09:14.470
By tightening your armpits,
the blood flow to the arteries is cut off.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.431
The blood in the arms simply flows out.

09:18.474 --> 09:24.063
Without blood, the arms
and fingers gradually thin, until…

09:26.983 --> 09:28.025
Sorry for the wait.`

09:28.693 --> 09:29.777
Huh?

09:29.860 --> 09:31.404
You're knowledgeable.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.656
Now we're both free.

09:34.615 --> 09:37.910
You, and I.

09:38.536 --> 09:41.789
A broken wall lies between us, but--

09:42.540 --> 09:43.541
That's right.

09:44.208 --> 09:47.670
We're already in each other's space.

09:56.637 --> 09:57.680
Heavy.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.517
Yeah, that's pretty good.

10:02.101 --> 10:03.686
That's really good, Baki!

10:04.312 --> 10:07.940
A great blow to the body,
given these restrictive conditions.

10:08.816 --> 10:12.194
Remarkable that you could get this much
weight behind it.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.405
I'm looking forward to this.

10:14.905 --> 10:15.948
How's this, Baki?

10:16.032 --> 10:17.867
Why don't you come over here!

10:24.290 --> 10:27.835
Rich Cox, 33 years old. American.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.712
Sentenced to 18 years.

10:29.795 --> 10:32.214
He was stuck in the wall.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.217
No, Baki was.

10:35.801 --> 10:36.719
And then--

10:38.971 --> 10:41.807
He was forcibly pulled through.

10:43.017 --> 10:45.102
What happened to the wall?

10:45.811 --> 10:47.271
There wasn't one anymore!

10:47.897 --> 10:49.774
It'd become one room!

10:51.734 --> 10:53.736
And then Mister said--

10:54.320 --> 10:56.238
Out of the way, Cox.

10:57.198 --> 10:58.741
You bet I moved!

10:58.824 --> 11:00.743
What was incredible came after that.

11:03.537 --> 11:06.248
He had his arm and leg like this.

11:06.832 --> 11:08.501
Did he throw him to the ground?

11:09.418 --> 11:11.128
No, he didn't.

11:13.214 --> 11:16.092
Like this, get it?

11:16.175 --> 11:17.718
He flung him.

11:17.802 --> 11:19.345
Like a towel!

11:20.888 --> 11:23.265
He was doing to a person! Flinging him!

11:25.226 --> 11:27.561
I don't know how many times he did it.

11:27.645 --> 11:30.022
Must have been disheartening.

11:31.148 --> 11:34.777
I mean, it was beyond
a difference in physical strength.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.279
After that?

11:37.363 --> 11:38.572
He let him go.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.783
Because to the boss, he's just a towel.

11:41.909 --> 11:44.620
Huh? After that? I dunno.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.038
Why not, you ask?

11:50.960 --> 11:52.586
He went into the next cell.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.922
Or rather, much farther!

12:01.470 --> 12:05.683
Second witness, Edward Bacara. American.

12:05.766 --> 12:08.394
Twenty-nine years old.
Eight-year sentence.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.439
His nickname is Unchained,

12:11.522 --> 12:14.734
but I thought it was about authority.

12:14.817 --> 12:19.989
You know, rules. Laws.

12:20.656 --> 12:23.993
That he wasn't bound by any of that.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.704
Well, that's what you'd think, right?

12:26.787 --> 12:28.998
That, in and of itself is amazing enough.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.084
But that's not it.

12:32.168 --> 12:35.838
It doesn't mean anything so abstract.

12:35.921 --> 12:39.008
Anyone would know if they saw it.

12:40.176 --> 12:43.512
It means there's no room
that could hold him.

12:49.685 --> 12:53.939
I mean, he goes through
three solitary cell walls--

12:54.023 --> 12:58.027
Sorry, I mean four.
Then he breaks a steel door.

12:58.611 --> 13:02.114
There's nothing
that could keep hold of a guy like that.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.036
Let me talk about
what happened after that.

13:07.787 --> 13:12.666
Bob McCarthy. Twenty-seven years old.
American. Prison Guard.

13:13.334 --> 13:16.796
Right, so he was waiting
for him to get up.

13:18.047 --> 13:20.508
His gaze was surprisingly tranquil,

13:20.591 --> 13:23.093
as if he wasn't in the middle of a fight.

13:24.011 --> 13:25.304
That's when it happened.

13:26.138 --> 13:30.476
As he was getting up,
Baki delivered a kick to the calf.

13:31.352 --> 13:34.146
After being dropped onto concrete
from three floors up,

13:34.230 --> 13:36.732
it was amazing Baki
was counterattacking, but--

13:36.816 --> 13:39.860
Mr. Oliva easily grabbed him.

13:42.029 --> 13:44.573
He's so fast, even with that body of his.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.745
Baki kicked him, with his other leg.

13:50.454 --> 13:53.791
But Mr. Oliva was like
an Olympic torch bearer.

13:53.874 --> 13:57.127
He calmly directed us--

13:58.420 --> 14:00.756
to "get back."

14:03.592 --> 14:06.887
I doubted my own ears.

14:12.059 --> 14:14.144
I'd never heard a sound like that before.

14:17.147 --> 14:20.734
Baki Hanma was engraved in the ground,
as if he were a stamp.

14:20.818 --> 14:25.614
When we measured it later,
it was a 30 cm deep imprint.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.160
What was Oliva thinking then?

14:30.744 --> 14:32.955
I dunno. It's hard to say.

14:33.038 --> 14:37.209
He's a man of many mysteries, even to us.

14:42.381 --> 14:43.674
I gasped.

14:46.510 --> 14:49.638
Even though he just went
from face down to face up,

14:49.722 --> 14:52.182
he moved on his own volition!

14:56.270 --> 14:57.313
Ah…

14:59.315 --> 15:01.191
That feels good.

15:01.901 --> 15:06.739
The full power of the strongest man,
Biscuit Oliva.

15:11.869 --> 15:15.748
This feeling, this sweet tingling…

15:17.833 --> 15:19.793
It's the same as five years ago.

15:20.419 --> 15:26.842
That feeling I had fighting my father,
Yujiro Hanma.

15:27.593 --> 15:32.848
An unfathomable difference in capability.

15:35.517 --> 15:37.311
How nostalgic.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.356
Ah, there it goes.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.816
Now it's starting.

15:46.195 --> 15:51.200
Huh? Am I melting?

15:52.451 --> 15:53.702
Liquefying.

15:54.286 --> 15:55.579
Viscous.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.707
Then runny.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.710
Just like water.

16:02.586 --> 16:05.297
No, even silkier.

16:05.798 --> 16:10.678
Silkier than water, expanding,

16:10.761 --> 16:13.681
until I fill this whole place up.

16:16.684 --> 16:19.979
That's right! Baki jumped back up.

16:20.896 --> 16:22.815
No, not a jump.

16:22.898 --> 16:24.984
It wasn't something that simple.

16:28.904 --> 16:33.075
What first alerted me to the change was

16:34.451 --> 16:35.494
the floor.

16:36.954 --> 16:39.415
The concrete he had lain on,

16:39.498 --> 16:41.500
specifically where his back had been.

16:42.167 --> 16:46.505
Baki's sweat stains
looked just like a face!

16:49.091 --> 16:52.761
I'd heard the legendary tales,
but this was my first time seeing it.

16:53.470 --> 16:55.973
It exists only in Japanese martial arts.

16:56.473 --> 17:00.811
And, was ultimately sealed away.
Hit Muscle Exercise.

17:02.104 --> 17:06.525
The appearance of the devil's face,
formed only by that kind of training.

17:07.443 --> 17:11.447
What's even more amazing is that,
standing there,

17:11.530 --> 17:13.657
Baki reminded me of a man…

17:14.700 --> 17:17.536
the most skilled swordsman in the world,

17:18.120 --> 17:21.665
a man everyone knows of, Musashi Miyamoto.

17:24.501 --> 17:27.004
It's said that
Musashi Miyamoto's physical ability

17:27.087 --> 17:31.258
surpasses even that
of a modern gold-medalist athlete.

17:31.759 --> 17:34.762
Such an extraordinary martial artist,

17:34.845 --> 17:38.766
but Baki Hanma, a mere 18-year-old teen,
made me think of him.

17:39.767 --> 17:41.810
What's going to happen now?

17:41.894 --> 17:43.687
You're late, Baki.

17:44.229 --> 17:47.816
You shouldn't make your elders wait.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.444
You look good.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.905
Shall we begin?

17:53.864 --> 17:56.075
I couldn't help but anticipate it.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.787
I'd seen it once in a Japanese movie.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.752
Fate decided in an instant.

18:06.835 --> 18:09.546
An unsporty conclusion like that.

18:10.547 --> 18:14.843
Mr. Oliva was fully aware
of the change in the young man.

18:15.427 --> 18:18.347
Beautiful, Baki.

18:18.430 --> 18:23.018
I seem to have hit quite the switch.

18:24.603 --> 18:28.524
You know, cheap tricks don't suit me.

18:31.985 --> 18:33.278
Here I come!

18:40.452 --> 18:42.871
I swear to God,

18:43.705 --> 18:47.376
I did not blink in that moment.

18:49.002 --> 18:52.172
I think Mr. Oliva went to move forward.

18:52.714 --> 18:57.010
Ever so slightly, it looked like
his weight transferred forward.

18:57.094 --> 19:01.515
Then, as if he changed his mind,
he mysteriously dived to the floor.

19:02.099 --> 19:04.101
For us Westerners,

19:04.184 --> 19:07.229
it was such a high-level battle,
we couldn't even follow it.

19:07.312 --> 19:10.023
But, we were lucky.

19:10.107 --> 19:14.278
We had something
that was watching what happened.

19:16.780 --> 19:19.533
Ready? I'm going to start the timer.

19:20.492 --> 19:22.244
The two of them haven't moved yet.

19:23.328 --> 19:26.623
Now Baki starts moving.
Oliva hasn't moved yet.

19:27.749 --> 19:28.625
A hit!

19:29.668 --> 19:36.383
The images after this show that Oliva
had already blacked out at this moment.

19:37.801 --> 19:41.597
This is about when our naked eyes
were able to register it.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.308
This is one second after the start.

19:47.394 --> 19:48.228
Oliva…

19:49.396 --> 19:51.982
He didn't even resist.

19:52.065 --> 19:52.900
That's right.

19:52.983 --> 19:56.069
"That's right," you say?
Come on, now.

19:56.862 --> 20:00.324
Explain. Why didn't he resist?

20:00.908 --> 20:03.577
Because Mr. Oliva wasn't conscious.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.747
What is this, a joke?

20:06.830 --> 20:09.750
Are you saying he lost consciousness?

20:10.500 --> 20:13.086
The video shows him standing there.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.589
He's ready to fight.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.842
Yes, that is true. But…

20:20.093 --> 20:22.221
Just as I thought.

20:22.304 --> 20:26.558
The snotty-nosed kid had a growth spurt.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.478
Expected nothing less from a Hanma.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.481
I was right to expect great things.

20:35.567 --> 20:38.403
Tor Nørretranders wrote the book,

20:39.279 --> 20:43.492
The User Illusion: Cutting
Consciousness Down to Size.

20:44.785 --> 20:49.039
In that book, Nørretranders writes,

20:50.707 --> 20:55.629
Consciousness is delayed 0.5 seconds.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.632
When a person moves,

20:58.715 --> 21:04.137
a signal is sent to the brain
0.5 seconds beforehand.

21:04.763 --> 21:07.015
For example, a knife comes flying at you.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.017
The signal is sent!

21:09.851 --> 21:13.522
But, consciousness
comes 0.5 seconds later.

21:13.605 --> 21:17.150
Now the brains says, "Danger! Move!"

21:17.985 --> 21:18.986
Action occurs.

21:19.987 --> 21:24.116
In other words, you are unconscious
during the 0.5 seconds it takes

21:24.199 --> 21:27.911
to become aware
of the signal that was sent.

21:28.495 --> 21:30.914
Anything can happen in that time frame.

21:31.498 --> 21:33.667
The briefest of moments.

21:33.750 --> 21:36.503
And, you made it yours.

21:37.754 --> 21:41.091
The many difficult situations
you have escaped.

21:41.633 --> 21:44.553
Not being able to let up
in your daily life.

21:44.636 --> 21:48.056
And then, the Hanma blood
coursing through your body.

21:48.724 --> 21:52.311
All of those things
gifted you 0.5 seconds.

21:53.353 --> 21:58.525
A rare way of thinking,
impossible in modern sports.

21:58.608 --> 22:00.736
It exists only in Japanese martial arts.

22:00.819 --> 22:03.572
While, that is indeed a treasure…

22:04.531 --> 22:06.575
I don't need it.

22:06.658 --> 22:12.080
Because I have this!

22:16.585 --> 22:18.170
What is that?

23:46.716 --> 23:51.179
