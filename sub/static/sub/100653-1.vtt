Apartheid or no apartheid

06:25.769 --> 06:26.667
I was told,
I was told to.

06:26.669 --> 06:28.203
It doesn't help me
being on the lawn.

06:28.205 --> 06:29.338
No, no, no.

07:22.092 --> 07:23.358

07:23.360 --> 07:24.493
Don't you have any homework?

07:24.495 --> 07:25.928
No.

07:25.930 --> 07:27.362
Maybe I should pay
your teacher a visit.

07:27.364 --> 07:28.797
Yeah and maybe you can pay

07:28.799 --> 07:29.965

09:48.572 --> 09:52.140
Thank you Mrs. Chetty but
I think you need to go home.

09:52.142 --> 09:56.545
A lady in your condition
shouldn't be lifting anything.

09:56.547 --> 09:58.615
Ticky come help here man!

09:59.917 --> 10:02.117

10:21.038 --> 10:22.104
It's only me man.

10:23.574 --> 10:25.941
I'm sorry I only

10:25.943 --> 10:26.875
I speak it to.

10:26.877 --> 10:30.545
Hey, I can talk English
I can walk English,

10:30.547 --> 10:34.349
I can even laugh English
you bloody fellow.

10:34.351 --> 10:36.385
English is a very
funny language sir.

10:36.387 --> 10:38.186
It's the condition
and consideration.

10:38.188 --> 10:39.654
The conjunction
becomes the injunction

10:39.656 --> 10:41.590
and the injunction
becomes annotations.

10:41.592 --> 10:44.025
Frustration and temptation
are common to all nations

10:44.027 --> 10:46.027
because conditions
become contradictions

10:46.029 --> 10:47.963
and predictions
become premonitions,

10:47.965 --> 10:49.331
that's why it
results in pollution,

10:49.333 --> 10:50.732
diffusion, destruction,
demolition.

10:50.734 --> 10:52.601
Derogation, declaration,
degeneration,

10:52.603 --> 10:56.238
definition, deliberation,
and decoction.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.506
You know it?

10:57.508 --> 10:58.974
It's easy.

10:58.976 --> 11:01.410
Think Super Star Rajinikanth.

11:01.412 --> 11:03.447
It's from Velaikaren man.

11:08.685 --> 11:10.753

11:19.329 --> 11:22.564
Who's talking about
TV you stupid fellow?

11:22.566 --> 11:25.100

Bachchan, super star Rajini.

11:29.339 --> 11:31.006
Mithun Chakraborty.

11:31.008 --> 11:34.009

11:34.011 --> 11:36.313
I'll have to fix you one time.

11:38.182 --> 11:40.048
Hey what's your name?

11:40.050 --> 11:41.049
Harold Singh.

11:41.051 --> 11:42.284
That's your real name?

11:42.286 --> 11:46.188
Yes but my mom used
to call me Baboo.

11:46.190 --> 11:47.790
Hey you talk funny,
,

11:47.792 --> 11:49.493
you make me laugh.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.065
Hey Baboo's a much better

11:57.067 --> 11:58.433
name.

11:58.435 --> 12:03.240
You can call me Ticky,.

12:08.111 --> 12:12.047
Oh dear Lord, this was a
weeding gift from the church

12:12.049 --> 12:14.249
You are so clumsy,
look what you done.

12:14.251 --> 12:15.584
It's not so bad bro, wait I'll

12:15.586 --> 12:17.152

12:17.154 --> 12:19.488

you all leave now.

12:19.490 --> 12:22.392
Jesus has suffered
more than enough.

12:24.561 --> 12:26.230
Ma'am you to please.

12:29.767 --> 12:30.665
Oh granny I think you have

12:30.667 --> 12:34.135

12:39.476 --> 12:41.409
Yeah, we waiting for ma.

12:41.411 --> 12:43.113
Please take her.

12:47.317 --> 12:50.385
Don't worry Harold
this is only temporary.

12:50.387 --> 12:51.787
As soon as things get better for

12:51.789 --> 12:55.156
the paper up in Johannesburg
we'll go right back.

12:55.158 --> 12:57.726
Till then we just have
to keep our heads down.

12:57.728 --> 13:00.128
Things can't possible
get any worse, right?

13:02.199 --> 13:05.133
These bloody Chetty's, you
see Harold the only way to

13:05.135 --> 13:10.240
deal with Indians like these
is to be firm and not give in.

13:14.411 --> 13:15.312
Vanakkam.

13:16.580 --> 13:17.412
Namaste.

13:19.683 --> 13:21.283
Top of the evening to you.

13:24.321 --> 13:28.623
Welcome to the Mulberry hood.

13:28.625 --> 13:30.292
It's a place.

13:30.294 --> 13:34.162
Safe, provided you've
got the protection.

13:34.164 --> 13:36.834
Which luckily for you we provide

13:38.502 --> 13:40.838
for very small monthly cost.

13:41.773 --> 13:43.505
Who do we need
protecting from?

13:43.507 --> 13:45.275
That would be us.

13:46.376 --> 13:49.311
Since you're new
and all we'll start

13:49.313 --> 13:52.213

50 bucks a month.

13:52.215 --> 13:53.448
That's reasonable no?

13:53.450 --> 13:54.316
What says Size?

13:54.318 --> 13:55.450
Correct.

13:55.452 --> 13:57.554
I don't have any money.

13:59.924 --> 14:02.925
Big like you.

14:02.927 --> 14:05.160
You must have some
cash stashed somewhere

14:05.162 --> 14:06.394
here in your nice stuff.

14:06.396 --> 14:07.629
There's nothing.

14:07.631 --> 14:09.765
Trust me if I had I
would give it to you.

14:09.767 --> 14:10.933
I don't want any trouble.

14:10.935 --> 14:12.367
That's a good attitude

14:12.369 --> 14:15.805
to have.

14:15.807 --> 14:16.772
What are you doing?

14:16.774 --> 14:17.873
Leave my son alone.

14:17.875 --> 14:19.842
Please, he's just a child.

14:19.844 --> 14:23.547
Look, look I gave my
last cent to the movers.

14:24.949 --> 14:26.715
Seeing as I'm a reasonable man

14:26.717 --> 14:30.318
and all I'm prepared
to compromise.

14:30.320 --> 14:31.688
But just this once.

14:32.723 --> 14:34.391

14:39.463 --> 14:42.900
But I'll take what

14:44.334 --> 14:48.572
Okay, take what ever you
want just don't hurt my son.

14:53.210 --> 14:54.411
No that's mine.

14:55.545 --> 14:56.546
It speaks.

14:58.448 --> 14:59.851
Well laddie blame

15:00.985 --> 15:02.918

15:02.920 --> 15:05.589
He's the one that made the deal.

15:16.466 --> 15:18.733
Take anything else you
want from the house, please.

15:18.735 --> 15:20.502
But that bike means
a lot to my boy.

15:20.504 --> 15:22.539
A deal is a deal no?

15:23.540 --> 15:24.572
What say Reggie.

15:24.574 --> 15:25.407
Hey!

16:02.612 --> 16:06.481
Dear Lord please protect
us from the ruffians.

16:06.483 --> 16:09.350
May the novelty of our
presence wear off quickly

16:09.352 --> 16:11.754
and may we become
invisible to them.

16:11.756 --> 16:13.354
Help us get back
home to where there

16:13.356 --> 16:15.993
are more God fearing
white people.

16:18.562 --> 16:20.930
The Lord is my
shepherd, I shall not want.

16:20.932 --> 16:24.501
He maketh me to lie
down in green pastures.

16:28.005 --> 16:31.274
I can't take much
more of this Reg.

16:35.813 --> 16:36.979
How will this little one survive

16:36.981 --> 16:39.516
when we're barley surviving?

16:43.888 --> 16:45.553
When are you going to
leave this nonsense

16:45.555 --> 16:47.792
with Raja and get a real job?

16:52.096 --> 16:55.363
You need to be a father

18:47.879 --> 18:51.446
but for now you're going to
have to get used to being alone.

18:51.448 --> 18:56.087
Whatever you do don't let the
neighbors or anyone else in.

18:57.654 --> 18:59.788
Keep that door shut.

18:59.790 --> 19:03.895
We must avoid trouble and
keep to ourselves okay?

20:04.989 --> 20:05.955
Huh?

20:05.957 --> 20:07.823
One, two, three.

20:28.179 --> 20:29.845

20:29.847 --> 20:31.947
Hey, give that back.

20:35.987 --> 20:37.685

from me, how are you gonna

20:38.789 --> 20:40.856
get your bike back from
that shit bag animal Raja?

20:40.858 --> 20:43.125
Who said I wanted to do that?

20:43.127 --> 20:44.726
Looks,

20:44.728 --> 20:45.894

20:48.099 --> 20:49.031

20:50.301 --> 20:52.870
It's gonna break,

20:56.639 --> 20:57.973
It's gonna break,

20:57.975 --> 20:59.741

20:59.743 --> 21:02.144
Hands out of control man.

21:19.096 --> 21:20.329
Come on you slow poke, come on.

21:32.176 --> 21:36.947
Just yesterday I was telling
you not to mess me around.

21:38.182 --> 21:41.682
You lucky mut, what you told me?

21:41.684 --> 21:43.152
What you told me?

21:43.154 --> 21:47.858
He'll answer if you take
the sock out of his mouth man.

21:53.264 --> 21:55.197
I wasn't trying to
make a run for it.

21:55.199 --> 21:57.332
Oh no, you weren't
trying to pull a fast one?

21:57.334 --> 21:59.234
I wasn't, I promise.

21:59.236 --> 22:01.403

22:01.405 --> 22:04.108

22:07.244 --> 22:11.146

knives like a ninja.

22:16.053 --> 22:17.152
Be cool

22:17.154 --> 22:20.655

be six feet under.

22:20.657 --> 22:23.794
Please,
Raja don't hurt me.

22:25.930 --> 22:29.730
We're bros why would, I
would never run from you.

22:29.732 --> 22:32.236
You know I'm a man of my word.

22:37.740 --> 22:40.211
I'll get you in with the cartel.

22:41.846 --> 22:45.249
I spoke to the already
they know about you.

22:47.284 --> 22:49.220
Give me another chance.

22:51.922 --> 22:54.289
It's all gonna be fine Raj.

22:54.291 --> 22:56.291
Don't hurt me again.

22:56.293 --> 22:58.726
Hell man, why you
had to do that now?

22:58.728 --> 23:00.295
Are you questioning me?

23:00.297 --> 23:03.832
Size, is this space
monkey questioning me?

23:03.834 --> 23:06.268
I can't take this anymore,
just pay me my money

23:06.270 --> 23:08.170
and let me go.

23:08.172 --> 23:10.806
Are you a rat
tat tat Reggie boy?

23:10.808 --> 23:11.408

23:12.109 --> 23:14.109
You know what I do to rats?

23:14.111 --> 23:16.411
Hey you can kill, me
if you want to man cause

23:16.413 --> 23:20.249

23:20.251 --> 23:21.350
My

23:21.352 --> 23:24.753

23:24.755 --> 23:29.193
Hells man that wife of
yours, she's something else.

23:30.794 --> 23:34.429
Bet she's sorry she
never chose me huh?

23:34.431 --> 23:35.730
Let's.

23:35.732 --> 23:37.166
This is peanuts Raja.

23:37.168 --> 23:40.202
Let this one stew for a
couple of hours then let him go.

23:40.204 --> 23:42.905
You tell him I want results.

23:42.907 --> 23:47.342
Raja, what I must do with?

23:47.344 --> 23:51.847
Hey man, Raja.

24:06.330 --> 24:08.497
I knew you were trouble
from the moment I saw you.

24:08.499 --> 24:10.132
You smell like pee,

24:10.134 --> 24:12.401
me too,.

24:12.403 --> 24:13.902
I'm leaving this
place and I never want

24:13.904 --> 24:16.438
to see sugarcane or
another Indian ever again.

24:16.440 --> 24:17.573
But I thought you
wanted your bike back?

24:17.575 --> 24:19.808
I never sad that you just
wanted to get me killed.

24:19.810 --> 24:20.776
I'm going to tell
my father everything

24:20.778 --> 24:21.977
and he'll go to the police.

24:21.979 --> 24:23.445
You can't do that,
Reggie is Raja's slave,

24:23.447 --> 24:24.913
he will get the blame.

24:24.915 --> 24:27.082
We have to get Raja
directly, ourselves.

24:27.084 --> 24:28.050
Ourselves?

24:28.052 --> 24:29.218
Hey what kind of hero are you?

24:29.220 --> 24:30.385
You think Bachchlan
would act like

24:30.387 --> 24:32.120
a
and run away from a fight?

24:32.122 --> 24:33.989
I'm not a hero and I
don't know this Butt Chan.

24:33.991 --> 24:36.992
Jesus Christ I'm
dealing with a fool here.

24:36.994 --> 24:38.260
I don't mind being a fool.

24:38.262 --> 24:40.262
I'd rather be a living
fool than a dead hero.

24:40.264 --> 24:41.997
I don't know what
you fools do in Joburg

24:41.999 --> 24:45.334
but if you want to survive here
you better clean up your act

24:45.336 --> 24:47.369
and be a proper.

24:47.371 --> 24:48.403
Got it?

24:48.405 --> 24:50.072
And if I were you I wouldn't

24:50.074 --> 24:51.473
tell your anything

24:51.475 --> 24:52.740
unless you want to
be crocodile food

24:52.742 --> 24:56.545
if you can't be a decent hero
at least keep your trap shut.

24:56.547 --> 24:57.713
I'll take down the

24:57.715 --> 25:03.020
on my own, I don't need no
Joburg coward spoiling my plans.

25:54.571 --> 25:56.638
Hello Mr. Singh.

25:56.640 --> 25:57.841
Hot day huh?

26:01.011 --> 26:01.645
Okay.

26:02.513 --> 26:05.247
Shame I heard Mrs. Singh died.

26:05.249 --> 26:07.182
Poor got no mother.

26:07.184 --> 26:08.517
Child must be lonely man.

26:08.519 --> 26:10.619
Hells his mom?

26:10.621 --> 26:11.620
Shit man.

26:11.622 --> 26:12.890
Hey language.

26:33.644 --> 26:34.878
Dad.

26:37.614 --> 26:38.916
Never mind.

26:57.701 --> 26:59.668
That boy is wild.

26:59.670 --> 27:02.137
People are judged by the
company they keep Harold.

27:02.139 --> 27:03.972
And he is bad company.

27:03.974 --> 27:05.576
Stay away from him.

27:36.440 --> 27:38.573
I promised my dad I
wouldn't let you in.

27:38.575 --> 27:40.008
But something you want

27:40.010 --> 27:43.981
to see.

28:05.235 --> 28:08.203
Why couldn't we have
just met on the ground?

28:08.205 --> 28:09.471
Because the view is better up

28:09.473 --> 28:11.173
here.

28:11.175 --> 28:12.007
Follow me.

28:22.754 --> 28:24.352
Hey that's mine.

28:24.354 --> 28:26.154
You said you
didn't want it back.

28:26.156 --> 28:28.791
I do, it was the last
thing my mom gave me.

28:28.793 --> 28:32.095
Yeah I know, she
kicked the bucket.

28:33.697 --> 28:35.397
You're asking for trouble.

28:35.399 --> 28:37.032
Why that's my bike.

28:37.034 --> 28:38.333
It was stolen from me.

28:38.335 --> 28:40.635
That little witch
is Raja's niece.

28:40.637 --> 28:42.070
But she's so fair.

28:42.072 --> 28:44.506
Crocodile meat remember?

28:44.508 --> 28:46.141
She's just a girl.

28:58.121 --> 28:58.756
Oh my God.

29:03.160 --> 29:04.161
Excuse me.

29:05.562 --> 29:10.532
This is my bike and your
uncle Raja stole it from me.

29:10.534 --> 29:14.238
This is my bike, my
uncle got it for me.

29:15.205 --> 29:17.239
Thanks for keeping
it safe, I think.

29:30.187 --> 29:32.420
Who's looking for?

29:32.422 --> 29:34.489
Come, come on.

29:34.491 --> 29:35.858
You want some?

29:35.860 --> 29:37.492
Touch my partner one more time

29:37.494 --> 29:39.160
and you'll have yourself a case.

29:39.162 --> 29:41.196
And I'll break your face.

29:41.198 --> 29:43.164
One time, now get out, move.

29:44.501 --> 29:46.270
And you just get out.

29:48.138 --> 29:49.538
She still has my bike.

29:49.540 --> 29:51.172
Don't worry we'll get it back

29:51.809 --> 29:53.143
I'm telling you.

29:58.248 --> 30:00.282
Do you really think that
we can get my bike back?

30:00.284 --> 30:02.651
Of course, we just
need to bring Raja down.

30:02.653 --> 30:05.120
Put the dog in jail, then
you'll get your bike back

30:05.122 --> 30:06.388
and Reggie will get a real job.

30:06.390 --> 30:08.290
With money,.

30:08.292 --> 30:09.759
But why do you need me?

30:09.761 --> 30:12.394
Every hero has a
partner, don't you know?

30:12.396 --> 30:14.398
Didn't you watch Sholay?

30:15.833 --> 30:18.199
Doesn't matter anyway cause
You don't wanna be a hero.

30:18.201 --> 30:20.235
Maybe you can show me?

30:20.237 --> 30:23.438
How do I know you
won't chicken out?

30:23.440 --> 30:25.273
Cross my heart, hope to die.

30:25.275 --> 30:28.143
No man, don't die
and all just prove it.

30:28.145 --> 30:28.778
How?

30:28.780 --> 30:30.145
Jump.

30:30.147 --> 30:31.246
What?

30:31.248 --> 30:33.214
Jump down from here.

30:41.224 --> 30:44.161
Lesson one, don't
think, just jump.

30:47.899 --> 30:49.099
I'm alive.

30:54.671 --> 30:55.905
So you think you can handle

30:55.907 --> 31:00.677
the heat?

31:01.846 --> 31:02.912
A pinky promise can
never be broken.

31:02.914 --> 31:05.213
It is sacred like cows.

31:05.215 --> 31:06.247
Cows?

31:06.249 --> 31:07.148
Never mind that.

31:07.150 --> 31:09.217
Are we gonna bring
down the demon Raja?

31:09.219 --> 31:11.821
Partners, ?

31:11.823 --> 31:16.458
I know what a pinky
promise is, my mom taught me.

31:16.460 --> 31:18.928
Put it here.

31:18.930 --> 31:20.062
Put what?

31:20.064 --> 31:22.297
Hey you're a funny.

31:43.988 --> 31:49.192
Hey, what ya got there?

31:49.726 --> 31:51.359
You've been shopping?

31:51.361 --> 31:52.295
Nice, nice.

31:53.263 --> 31:54.629
You said month end.

32:20.758 --> 32:22.559
This back of mine.

32:28.032 --> 32:30.265
Did you get paid.

32:33.771 --> 32:36.874
What am I supposed
to do with this?

32:57.795 --> 33:00.597
I love them, I love them all.

33:04.367 --> 33:06.902
Lesson two if you
want to be a hero

33:06.904 --> 33:08.973
you must act like a hero.

33:10.540 --> 33:12.574
This is gonna be so.

35:04.654 --> 35:05.655
Sh, shut up.

35:23.640 --> 35:26.507
Harold, I
got the TV connected,

35:26.509 --> 35:27.843
you want to watch the news?

35:27.845 --> 35:29.078
News?

35:29.080 --> 35:32.680
Nope, I'm okay,
I'm going to bed.

35:32.682 --> 35:34.083
It's only six pm.

35:34.085 --> 35:34.919
I know.

35:54.772 --> 35:56.805
Hey, how's it?

36:31.208 --> 36:33.108
Raja's car must be fast.

36:33.110 --> 36:34.877
Yeah, it's a
V8, Reggie had one

36:34.879 --> 36:37.146
just like it with
styling rims and all.

36:37.148 --> 36:38.546
Really?

36:38.548 --> 36:39.281
,

36:39.283 --> 36:40.916
he was a drag racer, the best.

36:40.918 --> 36:43.285
He had trophies lined
up all over the wall.

36:43.287 --> 36:44.652
What happened?

36:44.654 --> 36:45.655
Sold them.

36:46.556 --> 36:48.192
No to the drag racing.

36:49.726 --> 36:51.195
He crashed big time.

36:52.529 --> 36:53.996
No ways.

36:53.998 --> 36:57.032
Yeah, he even broke
his back in the accident.

36:57.034 --> 37:00.871
Is that why he takes
the medicine from Raja?

37:03.540 --> 37:08.179
Pack up.

37:15.685 --> 37:17.920
We need to get in there.

37:17.922 --> 37:20.588
We also need evidence
of illegal activity.

37:20.590 --> 37:22.257
Illegal what, what?

37:22.259 --> 37:24.960
To prove that Raja's a crook.

37:24.962 --> 37:27.162
Oh we'll find evidence.

37:27.164 --> 37:28.831
Come on, let's,

37:28.833 --> 37:30.132
But the film isn't over.

37:30.134 --> 37:32.101
Don't worry, we'll
catch it next time.

37:32.103 --> 37:33.703
I've got an idea.

37:46.250 --> 37:47.950
How's it going Size?

37:47.952 --> 37:48.851
, what you want?

37:48.853 --> 37:50.651
Raja said you were
looking for help.

37:50.653 --> 37:53.688
To clean the club.

37:53.690 --> 37:54.923
Raja?

37:54.925 --> 37:56.191
Yeah man, for
five bob each man.

37:56.193 --> 37:59.795
Me and my friend will
make the club spotless.

37:59.797 --> 38:01.696
What you say?

38:01.698 --> 38:02.630
And you'll have more time to

38:02.632 --> 38:05.300
read your comics while we clean.

38:05.302 --> 38:07.302
What you taking
so long for Size?

38:07.304 --> 38:09.038
This is our last offer,
take it or leave it

38:10.207 --> 38:11.340
Hey boss, come hear this.

38:11.342 --> 38:13.175
Lesson three
heroes never leave

38:13.177 --> 38:14.243
their partners in a

38:14.245 --> 38:15.676
no matter what.

38:16.914 --> 38:18.313
Poo man, you and
your queens English.

38:18.315 --> 38:19.815
What's this?

38:19.817 --> 38:21.216
Reggie's kid says.

38:21.218 --> 38:22.317
Says were looking for
,

38:22.319 --> 38:24.153
to clean the club.

38:29.060 --> 38:30.292
What do you know
about cleaning?

38:30.294 --> 38:33.796
Try us and see, come on man.

38:33.798 --> 38:38.033
You and the

38:38.035 --> 38:40.071
got some nerve coming here.

38:44.175 --> 38:45.009
But okay.

38:45.976 --> 38:49.980
Let's see if one Chetty
is good for something.

38:51.148 --> 38:53.583
Come tomorrow, ten o'clock.

38:59.656 --> 39:01.056
Did you wet your pants?

39:01.058 --> 39:01.924
No I didn't.

39:01.926 --> 39:03.125
I almost did.

39:03.127 --> 39:04.293
Okay
maybe just a little.

40:40.157 --> 40:44.293
My dancing, it was
the best wasn't it?

40:44.295 --> 40:46.295
And also what
was that swirly thing?

40:47.464 --> 40:51.300
But my dancing, it cracked
the whole floor over there.

40:51.302 --> 40:52.336
Ticky.

40:54.505 --> 40:55.339
Come.

40:59.443 --> 41:01.779
Come on, she don't bite.

41:05.349 --> 41:06.281
Where's ma?

41:06.283 --> 41:07.449
Sh.

41:07.451 --> 41:08.319
Oh, okay.

41:11.088 --> 41:13.390
Money man came to collect.

41:14.858 --> 41:19.396
I got for you and something.

41:27.137 --> 41:28.906
Get my props, go get.

41:35.579 --> 41:37.512
Watch this.

41:45.055 --> 41:49.526
Now who's worrying an old
lady on this bloody hot day?

41:50.461 --> 41:52.594
Can't you let me die in peace.

41:52.596 --> 41:54.596
I'm sorry ma but the
neighbors down the road said

41:54.598 --> 41:58.300
that this is the correct
house for the Chetty's.

41:58.302 --> 42:00.302
Are you calling me a liar?

42:00.304 --> 42:02.037
I'm at deaths door son.

42:02.039 --> 42:04.439
Will a dying old lady lie?

42:04.441 --> 42:06.541
And there's no, no
Chetty's living here,

42:06.543 --> 42:09.578
now get, get before I hit
you with my stick, get out!

42:13.584 --> 42:14.583
How was that?

42:14.585 --> 42:16.418
Tops ma, tops.

42:32.303 --> 42:34.303
What's?

42:55.926 --> 42:59.594
Dad have you ever watched
a Bollywood movie?

42:59.596 --> 43:01.330
No, never.

43:01.332 --> 43:02.664
Who's been telling
you about Bollywood?

43:02.666 --> 43:05.967
No, no one I read
it in the news paper.

43:05.969 --> 43:08.003
Apparently they're
very interesting films.

43:08.005 --> 43:09.638
Far from true Harold.

43:09.640 --> 43:13.175
That stuff will turn your
brains into candy floss.

43:13.177 --> 43:14.976
We don't want that now do we?

43:14.978 --> 43:15.579
No.

43:50.547 --> 43:52.314
The good news is you're in

43:52.316 --> 43:54.983
but the cartel doesn't
wanna deal with small fry.

43:54.985 --> 43:56.985
They wanna make sure
you can move quantity.

43:56.987 --> 43:59.521
They want you to move this.

44:00.457 --> 44:02.659
That's 200 k's worth of white.

44:04.695 --> 44:06.995
My man I'm the main man in

44:06.997 --> 44:08.630
these parts.

44:08.632 --> 44:09.564
Where to?

44:09.566 --> 44:11.366
Mbabane and it's dangerous.

44:11.368 --> 44:12.667
There's a good chance
you're delivery guy's

44:12.669 --> 44:14.336
gonna get caught either

44:14.338 --> 44:16.972
by the cops or a rival
gang if he's not careful.

44:16.974 --> 44:20.275
No worries, we know
just the guy for the job.

44:20.277 --> 44:21.543
What if he fails?

44:21.545 --> 44:24.915
Worst case scenario,
I pay the 200,000.

44:27.584 --> 44:30.519
It's my head on the
block and yours Raj.

44:30.521 --> 44:32.154
You don't wanna mess
with these people.

44:32.156 --> 44:34.990
Easy peasy my man,
relax, don't worry

44:34.992 --> 44:38.593
my man Reggie is desperate
enough for this job.

44:41.165 --> 44:42.397
Be cool,

44:42.399 --> 44:45.169
unless you wanna
be six feet under.

44:47.404 --> 44:49.404
That lousy piece of
shit, I'll cut him,

44:49.406 --> 44:51.072
I'll poke him.

44:51.074 --> 44:53.041
Who does he think he is, he's
putting Reggie in danger.

44:53.043 --> 44:54.543
Maybe this is
going to be easy,

44:54.545 --> 44:57.045
now there's evidence the
police just need to find it.

44:57.047 --> 44:58.013
Let's finish this quick,

44:58.015 --> 44:59.782
we've got some serious
business to handle now.

45:05.189 --> 45:06.388
What's this thing?

45:06.390 --> 45:07.722
Typewriter, we can use it

45:07.724 --> 45:11.259
to type a letter to
the police chief.

45:11.261 --> 45:14.262
I knew you had some brains.

45:14.264 --> 45:15.730
My dad used to write stories

45:15.732 --> 45:19.034
for the newspaper about
crazy people and criminals.

45:19.036 --> 45:21.036
But now he only writes
about dead people.

45:21.038 --> 45:22.170
Why?

45:22.172 --> 45:22.872
Dead people don't read papers

45:27.144 --> 45:28.677
Okay what should it say?

45:28.679 --> 45:30.345
Veerasamy, listen here.

45:30.347 --> 45:34.151
There's a bad crook
name Raja, lock him up.

45:35.652 --> 45:37.321
Station commander.

45:57.441 --> 46:00.141
Harold, who were
you talking to.

46:00.143 --> 46:01.378
No one, myself.

46:04.114 --> 46:05.647
What are you doing
with they typewriter?

46:05.649 --> 46:06.717
Practicing.

46:13.290 --> 46:14.124
Okay.

46:56.901 --> 46:57.734
Ticky.

47:07.711 --> 47:11.816
Mrs. Pillay did you put
this letter on my desk?

47:30.902 --> 47:32.336
That's 1,000.

47:33.604 --> 47:34.438
Why now?

47:37.307 --> 47:38.774
How you bro.

47:38.776 --> 47:41.944
Like I'm up to
something and all?

47:41.946 --> 47:45.246
Who looked after you
since the accident?

47:45.248 --> 47:48.652
You was a cripple, no
one could hire you.

47:50.454 --> 47:53.858
What you
want for this kindness?

47:54.792 --> 47:55.692
Kindness.

47:56.894 --> 47:59.162
Yeah that's more like it.

48:00.564 --> 48:03.331
Have an important
delivery for you to make.

48:03.333 --> 48:04.167
For that.

48:04.802 --> 48:06.936
You get this 1,000.

48:06.938 --> 48:10.505
Come back safely I'll give
you another four clips.

48:10.507 --> 48:12.376
How does that sound?

48:29.961 --> 48:31.894
You will
never catch me.

48:44.374 --> 48:45.542
What's this?

48:47.544 --> 48:50.679
Where's the owner
of this night club?

48:50.681 --> 48:53.383
Raja you have some visitors.

48:55.953 --> 48:58.020
The commander gonna.

48:58.022 --> 48:58.888
Chief.

48:58.890 --> 48:59.523
Hey Raj.

49:00.691 --> 49:03.025
Hi man I just came to check on

49:03.027 --> 49:05.493
the preparation for
the wedding reception.

49:05.495 --> 49:06.594
We all set here, we had

49:06.596 --> 49:08.563
the place spring
cleaned and everything.

49:08.565 --> 49:10.432
See you using child labor hey?

49:10.434 --> 49:13.468
More like baby sitting.

49:14.671 --> 49:18.007
Listen the wife and some
ladies are going to come later

49:18.009 --> 49:21.645
to check up on the
decorations and all that.

49:23.613 --> 49:25.647
No hassle.

49:25.649 --> 49:26.851
Bro, come here.

49:30.520 --> 49:33.521
You got to be careful, I found
this on my desk this morning.

49:33.523 --> 49:36.424
You can't expect me
to turn a blind eye

49:36.426 --> 49:38.493
with things like
this lying around.

49:38.495 --> 49:40.430
Find the leak, plug it.

49:42.499 --> 49:43.600
No worries.

49:45.535 --> 49:47.370
No one messes with me.

49:48.940 --> 49:51.974
It can only be
one of two people.

49:51.976 --> 49:53.541
Change of plans.

49:53.543 --> 49:55.577
Someone told the pigs
about the merchandise,

49:55.579 --> 49:57.012
move it somewhere else.

49:57.014 --> 49:58.015
Sure boss.

50:00.084 --> 50:02.752
He knows it's us, he
looked straight at me.

50:02.754 --> 50:03.919
If he thought it was us we'd

50:03.921 --> 50:05.653
be sleeping with the crocodiles.

50:05.655 --> 50:09.491
He looked at me because
he thinks it's Reggie.

50:09.493 --> 50:11.827
We need to warn him now.

50:26.043 --> 50:28.578
Okay, okay, okay.

50:30.447 --> 50:31.548
Here, have some.

50:34.018 --> 50:36.754
Hey Ticky, come
have some cake.

50:39.023 --> 50:40.756
What's going on?

50:40.758 --> 50:42.657
Why didn't Raja you?

50:42.659 --> 50:43.759
What?

50:43.761 --> 50:45.360
He thinks you ratted him
out to the police right?

50:45.362 --> 50:46.796
Hey wait
now, how you knew that?

50:46.798 --> 50:48.696
If you were at the
club you would know.

50:48.698 --> 50:50.099
Hey, what you
were doing there?

50:50.101 --> 50:51.599
Trying to earn some
money for the family,

50:51.601 --> 50:55.403
only difference is
my money comes home.

50:55.405 --> 50:56.704
That's no place of.

50:56.706 --> 50:58.740
Why're you doing a
dirty dogs business?

50:58.742 --> 51:00.642
Why you got so much money here?

51:00.644 --> 51:03.411
Why you can't even see
that he's setting you up.

51:03.413 --> 51:05.647
I'm a child and I can see that.

51:05.649 --> 51:09.619
Don't do the delivery for
him Reggie, don't do it.

51:11.756 --> 51:13.889
What's he saying Reg?

51:13.891 --> 51:15.157
What's Ticky talking about?

51:15.159 --> 51:17.795
Hey never mind, here take her.

51:24.035 --> 51:25.702
What do we do now?

52:01.939 --> 52:03.705
What is it Harold?

52:03.707 --> 52:05.877
Have a grown another head?

52:07.912 --> 52:09.845
When will you be able to
write real stores again,

52:09.847 --> 52:11.914
not just about dead people?

52:11.916 --> 52:13.916
I'm new there
Harold, I can't really

52:13.918 --> 52:15.985
be sticking my neck out.

52:15.987 --> 52:17.485
Besides people who die are owed

52:17.487 --> 52:19.554
the respect of a proper tribute.

52:19.556 --> 52:20.823
It's an important job.

52:20.825 --> 52:22.124
Yes but you said
criminals should

52:22.126 --> 52:24.894
be taken off the street
and be locked up.

52:24.896 --> 52:27.763
If you knew about one,
could you write a story?

52:27.765 --> 52:28.898
Has that thug and
his goon been coming

52:28.900 --> 52:31.834
around here while I'm at work?

52:31.836 --> 52:32.768
No.

52:32.770 --> 52:34.036
Good, that would be terrible.

52:34.038 --> 52:36.839
Yes but wouldn't you like to
see someone like him in jail?

52:36.841 --> 52:39.842
Writing the obituaries
suits me right now.

52:39.844 --> 52:41.511
Ever since your mom.

52:43.814 --> 52:46.683
We've had enough change for now.

53:41.272 --> 53:44.073
My dads here,
it's his day off.

53:44.075 --> 53:45.174
We have to go to the club,

53:45.176 --> 53:47.209
it's now or never.

53:47.211 --> 53:48.978
I can't today.

53:48.980 --> 53:51.947
We'll be back before he
even notices you're gone.

53:51.949 --> 53:53.616
Besides he's asleep.

54:10.001 --> 54:11.068
There's Size.

54:12.669 --> 54:13.938
Come my friend.

54:16.240 --> 54:18.073
What are we doing here?

54:18.075 --> 54:19.141
What's the plan?

54:19.143 --> 54:20.811
Let's see first.

54:25.850 --> 54:27.282
Size has
gone inside now.

54:27.284 --> 54:29.684
Those two people,
look dancers.

54:37.995 --> 54:39.562
Hey how's it going?

54:45.036 --> 54:46.835
Wedding we have here.

54:46.837 --> 54:48.937
Hey top outfits man.

54:48.939 --> 54:50.139
Come let's go in.

54:55.146 --> 55:00.151
You know me Raj,
I swear I'm a man of my word.

55:01.786 --> 55:03.052
Take this out back

55:03.054 --> 55:05.020
and teach him a lesson.

55:21.105 --> 55:22.239
Okay, come on.

55:33.150 --> 55:37.152
What the, Raja think about
it, why would I rat you out?

55:37.154 --> 55:38.921
My life is at stake here.

55:38.923 --> 55:41.759
You weren't
trying to set me up?

55:45.229 --> 55:49.064
This couldn't be me, I
don't even own a typewriter.

55:49.066 --> 55:53.370
If it's not Reggie and
it's not you, then who is it?

55:57.174 --> 56:00.708
You're not trying to get
out of the deal are you?

56:00.710 --> 56:04.246
That would be a bad thing,
that would be a very bad thing.

56:04.248 --> 56:05.082
Shut up.

56:06.250 --> 56:08.786
Where's the contact details?

56:12.356 --> 56:14.289
You have to move
the product tonight

56:14.291 --> 56:17.895
otherwise you're gonna
miss the deadline.

56:20.064 --> 56:21.363
Get Reggie.

56:21.365 --> 56:24.902
After this circus is
done he can get going.

56:31.308 --> 56:33.108
Reggie can't go.

56:33.110 --> 56:35.944
Why don't we destroy the
drugs, no drugs no delivery.

56:35.946 --> 56:37.880
But it also means no evidence.

56:37.882 --> 56:42.887
Raja won't go to jail and
you won't get your bike back.

56:44.088 --> 56:45.888
You're dads life more
important than my bike.

56:45.890 --> 56:46.723
Serious?

56:49.493 --> 56:52.194
Okay, we need to get
into Raja's office.

56:52.196 --> 56:53.495
How will we,
remember it's locked?

56:55.799 --> 56:56.999
Hey.

57:00.871 --> 57:01.704
Harold.

57:04.842 --> 57:05.675
Harold?

57:30.334 --> 57:32.334
Hells there's the devil Leila.

57:32.336 --> 57:34.169
Let's.

57:42.046 --> 57:44.146
There you are, there you are.

57:44.148 --> 57:46.515
Hey time to go onto the stage,

57:46.517 --> 57:50.152
the guests need
some entertainment.

57:50.154 --> 57:53.422
Sorry commander, my stomach,
I must go to the toilet.

57:53.424 --> 57:57.025
She must dance without me,
she can do very good Sirdevi.

57:57.027 --> 57:58.360
Make a distraction.

57:58.362 --> 58:01.396
It's a number two sir,
it's a number two.

58:01.398 --> 58:02.898
Sirdevi huh?

58:02.900 --> 58:04.466
Very good my girl.

58:04.468 --> 58:07.202
You go onto the stage and
you entertain the guests.

58:07.204 --> 58:10.708
Hey DJ hit us with
Sirdevi number there.

58:11.508 --> 58:14.476
Oh look, I can
see her fat stomach.

58:56.520 --> 58:58.954
Boss, who's the mamba.

59:41.665 --> 59:44.132
Poor peoples money, bastards.

01:00:02.419 --> 01:00:07.424
Ram, Sita, ?

01:00:07.691 --> 01:00:08.359
And you.

01:00:13.664 --> 01:00:14.696
Yes.

01:00:27.177 --> 01:00:30.312
Hey disco dancer, you
don't look very sick to me.

01:00:30.314 --> 01:00:32.681
Come here, I paid for
two dancers you little.

01:01:02.579 --> 01:01:03.380
Ticky!

01:01:05.082 --> 01:01:06.083
Ticky!

01:01:07.384 --> 01:01:08.185
Ticky!

01:01:16.994 --> 01:01:17.594
Ticky!

01:01:18.729 --> 01:01:19.530
Ticky?

01:01:24.769 --> 01:01:26.201
Excuse me Mrs. Chetty.

01:01:26.203 --> 01:01:27.669
Hello Dev how are you?

01:01:27.671 --> 01:01:31.175
I'm okay, have you seen
Harold by any chance?

01:01:32.342 --> 01:01:34.376
You don't think maybe
he's with Ticky?

01:01:34.378 --> 01:01:37.147
Maybe they're
probably playing.

01:01:38.081 --> 01:01:39.782
Okay, thank you Mrs. Chetty.

01:01:39.784 --> 01:01:40.617
Okay.

01:01:44.354 --> 01:01:46.087
bro,

01:01:46.089 --> 01:01:48.091
it was touch and go hey?

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:54.162
Hey man what you
giving me daggers for?

01:01:54.164 --> 01:01:55.163
What's this you off

01:01:55.165 --> 01:01:55.697
your rocker.

01:01:55.699 --> 01:01:56.665
My dad was right,

01:01:56.667 --> 01:01:58.500
I should never have
made friends with you.

01:01:58.502 --> 01:02:00.335
Relax, I got the
drugs and more see?

01:02:00.337 --> 01:02:01.503
Without all this
stuff Raja can't

01:02:01.505 --> 01:02:02.671
pay Mr. White
don't you see that?

01:02:02.673 --> 01:02:03.672
Where were you?

01:02:03.674 --> 01:02:05.407
You left me back
there all alone.

01:02:05.409 --> 01:02:06.809
You broke the rule,
heroes never leave

01:02:06.811 --> 01:02:08.510
their partners in the
poo no matter what.

01:02:08.512 --> 01:02:10.445
You're a liar like your
drug addicted father.

01:02:10.447 --> 01:02:12.047
And you're a fat
coward like your father.

01:02:12.049 --> 01:02:13.315
If he wasn't such a wuss

01:02:13.317 --> 01:02:14.583
you still would have
that stupid bike.

01:02:14.585 --> 01:02:16.117
You're hero lessons
are stupid like you,

01:02:16.119 --> 01:02:17.486
and now they're gonna
get me killed to.

01:02:17.488 --> 01:02:19.521
Raja saw me, he saw my face.

01:02:19.523 --> 01:02:21.089
You and your stupid
Bollywood heroes,

01:02:21.091 --> 01:02:22.724
they're just people
pretending to be heroes.

01:02:22.726 --> 01:02:25.060
This is real life,
not Bollywood.

01:03:29.827 --> 01:03:32.327
Harold are you okay?

01:03:32.329 --> 01:03:33.230
I'm fine.

01:03:41.271 --> 01:03:45.540
Don't worry dad, I'm never
gonna see Ticky again.

01:03:45.542 --> 01:03:48.211
You were right about everything.

01:03:50.247 --> 01:03:52.447
You wanna tell
me what happened?

01:03:52.449 --> 01:03:53.450
Not today.

01:03:57.220 --> 01:03:58.255
Dad?

01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:01.725
Do you miss mom?

01:04:04.194 --> 01:04:05.195
Very much.

01:04:08.732 --> 01:04:10.334
Spell perseverance

01:04:12.402 --> 01:04:13.236
P E R.

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.275
S E R.

01:04:20.243 --> 01:04:21.443
V E R.

01:05:16.333 --> 01:05:17.365
Where were you?

01:05:17.367 --> 01:05:20.468
You left me back
there all alone.

01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:22.270
You broke the rule,
heroes never leave

01:05:22.272 --> 01:05:24.439
their partners in the
poo, no matter what.

01:05:33.717 --> 01:05:34.984
Boss we've been robbed.

01:05:34.986 --> 01:05:36.418
What?

01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:38.253
The money, the
drugs, it's all gone.

01:05:38.255 --> 01:05:38.890
What!

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:51.435
Reggie.

01:05:54.438 --> 01:05:57.272
This is you Reggie,
where were you?

01:05:57.274 --> 01:06:01.043
,
don't be ridiculous Raja.

01:06:01.045 --> 01:06:02.677
Since Size fetched me
I've been here only,

01:06:02.679 --> 01:06:05.047
man with you or with him.

01:06:05.049 --> 01:06:05.682
Oh.

01:06:12.355 --> 01:06:13.688
What?

01:06:17.995 --> 01:06:20.729

01:06:25.368 --> 01:06:26.670
Ah it makes sense.

01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:33.508
That song and dance, the
little shits stole from me.

01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:34.542
Hey they're just,

01:06:34.544 --> 01:06:35.945
they couldn't have done this.

01:06:35.947 --> 01:06:38.580
Size, get me my gun.

01:06:38.582 --> 01:06:42.652

01:06:50.862 --> 01:06:51.695

01:06:52.930 --> 01:06:53.765
Baboo?

01:06:56.633 --> 01:07:00.772
Okay you don't have to speak
to me again, it's fine.

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:05.007
I messed up.

01:07:05.009 --> 01:07:08.378
I didn't mean to get
you into trouble.

01:07:09.646 --> 01:07:13.615
You can stay with me.

01:07:13.617 --> 01:07:15.853
I just wanted to say sorry.

01:07:16.988 --> 01:07:18.353
You heard?

01:07:18.355 --> 01:07:18.990
I'm sorry.

01:07:23.127 --> 01:07:25.695
You're right this is real life.

Bro what the hell man?

01:07:44.782 --> 01:07:45.981
There's no need for
these dramatics.

01:07:45.983 --> 01:07:49.584
Tammy go into the room and
lock yourself up with Tina.

01:07:49.586 --> 01:07:51.321
Reggie, what is this?

01:07:52.757 --> 01:07:55.157
What is this crook and his
ogre doing in my house?

01:07:55.159 --> 01:07:57.492
Hey you bloody rascal.

01:07:57.494 --> 01:07:59.594

Always had a mouth
on you Charmaine.

01:08:06.703 --> 01:08:08.904
Keep running it,
and you'll be sorry.

01:08:08.906 --> 01:08:11.140

01:08:20.885 --> 01:08:22.584

01:08:22.586 --> 01:08:24.519

you leaving my house.

My mom would have
liked you a lot.

01:11:44.088 --> 01:11:46.057
She was my best friend to.

01:11:47.992 --> 01:11:49.126
Don't die Ticky.

01:11:53.097 --> 01:11:58.102

A scratch, I'm not dying?

01:14:44.435 --> 01:14:45.467

01:15:08.259 --> 01:15:09.224
Oh ma, my foot.

01:15:09.226 --> 01:15:11.360
Bugger your foot man my cab.

01:15:11.362 --> 01:15:14.997
Hey bro
don't think just jump.

01:15:27.578 --> 01:15:29.978
Hey you
shit bag animals!

01:15:48.365 --> 01:15:53.168
Take that you.

01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:54.002
Charms, babes.

01:15:55.472 --> 01:15:59.141
Reggie go help the boys,
I'll take care of things here.

01:15:59.143 --> 01:16:01.076
The babies coming, help me.

01:16:01.078 --> 01:16:03.111
I'll call the ambulance
then I'll come back.

01:16:03.113 --> 01:16:04.479
Don't worry everything's
gonna be fine.

01:16:04.481 --> 01:16:05.480
No!

01:16:05.482 --> 01:16:08.317
The baby is not waiting
for any ambulance,

01:16:08.319 --> 01:16:12.389
go grab some towels and
we have to do it now, go.

01:16:14.191 --> 01:16:15.426
Breath, breath.

01:16:37.614 --> 01:16:40.582
Now I've got you you
little piece of shit.

01:16:41.585 --> 01:16:42.684
Let my go.

01:16:42.686 --> 01:16:44.319
The cops are on their way.

01:16:44.321 --> 01:16:47.122
And not that commander
friend of yours, Veerasamy.

01:16:47.124 --> 01:16:48.590
I made sure of that.

01:16:48.592 --> 01:16:50.559
Hell Reggie come
on, you and I.

01:17:26.997 --> 01:17:30.334
Hey what you did
today was very brave.

01:17:34.571 --> 01:17:37.139
I wish you hadn't
been forced to do it.

01:17:37.141 --> 01:17:38.573
It's okay.

01:17:38.575 --> 01:17:42.045
It's not okay, if
anything happened to you.

01:17:43.747 --> 01:17:46.450
I lost my way for a long time.

01:17:47.317 --> 01:17:50.452
It's time I did the right thing.

01:17:50.454 --> 01:17:54.291
I talked it over with
your mom and she agrees.

01:17:57.127 --> 01:17:58.627
I'm going to give
myself up Ticky.

01:17:58.629 --> 01:18:00.230
But us, the baby?

01:18:01.331 --> 01:18:03.698
I'll help the police
with their case.

01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:05.734
It's what I need to do.

01:18:05.736 --> 01:18:08.771
To be a good father
to you, Tammy, Tina,

01:18:08.773 --> 01:18:11.106
and this little one.

01:18:11.108 --> 01:18:14.176
So what would a
hero say to that?

01:18:14.178 --> 01:18:15.778
Go and take it like a man.

01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:19.247
Hey you know you
got three sisters now?

01:18:19.249 --> 01:18:21.185
God have mercy on me.

01:18:28.425 --> 01:18:32.394
Come on man, I need protecting,
what's your price bro?

01:18:32.396 --> 01:18:34.162
Come on man.

01:18:34.164 --> 01:18:36.398
Hey what's your, hey, hey!

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:38.567
Size, Size where are you man?

01:18:38.569 --> 01:18:41.069
Size, I'm talking to you.

01:18:41.071 --> 01:18:43.705
You thick mutt,
do something man.

01:18:43.707 --> 01:18:46.741
You're laughing, your
laugh, laugh I'll show you,

01:18:46.743 --> 01:18:47.810
I'll show all of you.

01:18:47.812 --> 01:18:52.149
Leila, Leila tell my
sister I need bail money.

01:18:57.254 --> 01:19:00.255
Listen here woman, this
bike belongs to my friend,

01:19:00.257 --> 01:19:02.123
his mother gave it to
him before she died,

01:19:02.125 --> 01:19:03.725
I promised I'd get
it back for him,

01:19:03.727 --> 01:19:05.427
I'm gonna take this
now, please don't

01:19:05.429 --> 01:19:07.062
create any more.

01:19:07.064 --> 01:19:09.199
I've had enough for one day.

01:19:21.211 --> 01:19:25.382
I guess I now have a
story to right, right Baboo?

01:19:27.451 --> 01:19:29.286
Thank you very much.

01:19:32.623 --> 01:19:37.628
A promise is a promise.

01:19:38.796 --> 01:19:40.595
Now let's break it
down like Bachchan.

01:19:50.173 --> 01:19:52.643
One ticket to the South Coast.

01:19:55.212 --> 01:19:56.444
What's happening?

01:19:56.446 --> 01:19:57.379
Excuse me sir, I'm
sorry about this.

01:19:57.381 --> 01:19:58.346
Knocking is out of fashion?

01:19:58.348 --> 01:19:59.548
But we have to take
you in for questioning.

01:19:59.550 --> 01:20:00.750
