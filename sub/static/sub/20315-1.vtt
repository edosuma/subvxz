-Just throw your "K's" up.

Just let them hear us
saying it all the time,
then they'll get it.

00:31.760 --> 00:35.000
We used to say, "Kurupt FM,

00:49.120 --> 00:52.840
Simple, it's an urban
powerhouse slash radio station,

00:52.880 --> 00:54.960
slash family unit.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.320
The biggest and baddest pirate

Aka Kurupt, like, best believe!
108.9 on your dial, yeah?

01:03.200 --> 01:08.440
The phone line is copping off
right now. We're going to 384,
Isleworth Mercy.

01:08.480 --> 01:11.840
We transmit throughout
the whole of West London.

01:11.880 --> 01:14.600
Obviously, once you get
to Shepherd's Bush,

01:14.640 --> 01:19.920
it gets a bit white noisy,
but we've still a lot of fans
down the Bush, White City.

01:19.960 --> 01:23.840
I reckon there's a lot of
people that drive closer
to the transmitter

01:23.880 --> 01:27.200
-in the car and maybe
set up a recording.
-Bring a picnic.

01:30.200 --> 01:33.200
-Just show around, innit?
-Yeah, show 'em round the manor.

01:33.240 --> 01:35.840
You've got the blocks
there and that.

01:35.880 --> 01:40.080
You see here, we've got
the garage, if you need Rizla
any time of day, boss!

01:40.120 --> 01:43.880
My philosophy in life,
yeah, is just, like,

01:43.920 --> 01:46.880
sort of, do whatever, basically.

01:46.920 --> 01:50.480
It brings up a lot of problems,
money issues and that, but...

You're not meant to know

them on a tour of Brentford.

It's, uh...

02:21.160 --> 02:24.080
We're not actually... Just cos
we're going round Brentford,

02:24.120 --> 02:27.880
doesn't mean the station's
in Brentford.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.920
It's a little radio trick
we call throwing them off
the scent.

02:30.960 --> 02:34.160
-We could be anywhere right now.
We could be in Brent Lea.
-Exactly.

02:36.840 --> 02:41.080
-[director] Is this all illegal?
-Cos it's illegal, mate.
It's part of the beauty of it.

you don't have do
any moving around.

When we first got together,
we used to do romantic things,

05:06.760 --> 05:10.800
like, he'd buy me clothes
and that, just...cos he
didn't like what I wore.

05:10.840 --> 05:13.400
[director]
So how did you two meet?

05:13.440 --> 05:16.240
It was actually really sweet.
Like, it was in a car park.

05:16.280 --> 05:20.680
I was just walking along
and he shouted something
at me from a van.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.360
And, yeah, it just all
went from there really.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.840

and that, so...

[director] Has he ever
been in trouble with the law?

times, but always silly
little things,

like that.

to say, though. Cos if it
was in the streets, yeah,

of his story.

I mean, at the time and that.

of DTI coming through, innit?

06:52.120 --> 06:56.560

07:03.840 --> 07:07.360
I just put them over
here, though, cos...

07:07.400 --> 07:11.440

would send us letters, cos
of the door number and that.

No, we do give a fuck.
Don't put that...
No, cos the government

then we're gonna have
the government on our case.

-Oh, for f... That's all
I need. That's all I need.

our doors off, bruv.

-What shall we do?

08:02.560 --> 08:06.080

constantly turning it up, yeah,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

08:06.120 --> 08:09.240
-So you sort it out! Yeah?
-Yeah.

08:09.280 --> 08:12.840
I think when Grindah's at
the station he has to be tough,

08:12.880 --> 08:18.360
cos he's in charge, but when
he's with me, he definitely
has a more like softer side.

08:18.400 --> 08:21.640
These are some pictures of him
before he was famous.

08:21.680 --> 08:25.280

zoo, holding a rabbit.

the same expression.

08:27.680 --> 08:30.960
Actually, this one's a good one.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.840
This was taken
when I was pregnant.

08:33.880 --> 08:38.240
But, obviously, we've both
lost a bit of weight since then.
Grindah went on Slimfast.

08:39.840 --> 08:42.280
The concept behind it

08:42.320 --> 08:45.880
was that we were in heaven,
because that's what it felt
like at that time.

08:45.920 --> 08:50.080
But the clouds aren't actually
there, that's just
camera trickery.

08:50.120 --> 08:53.600
What if we gave
the neighbour a knock

08:53.640 --> 08:56.640
and gave him some headphones
or earplugs or took requests?

08:56.680 --> 08:58.120
-Requests?
-Yeah.

08:58.160 --> 09:01.120
Right, you lot are a joke.

09:01.160 --> 09:03.160
I've got to call Chabuds,
mate, sort this out.

here, look.

call it that, isn't it?

give us a minute? See that?

09:56.680 --> 10:00.240

Obedience, very sexy in a woman.

get you anything.

10:14.240 --> 10:17.040
Not drugs though, cos
we get them from Decoy's uncle.

10:19.320 --> 10:22.080
Can you...
Can we start that again?

10:22.120 --> 10:24.120
Don't put that bit in.

10:24.160 --> 10:26.640
[Chabuds] That's probably
90 degrees, I'd say.

10:29.400 --> 10:32.960
I don't have to do all of it.
Just run it across there.

10:36.480 --> 10:40.560
I'm just waiting for the echo.
It actually indicates
the densities.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.920
Don't, don't, mate!

10:42.960 --> 10:45.600
Just get down.
Don't bang on the wall, mate.

10:45.640 --> 10:48.040
As I thought, uh, no echo.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.160
So...

10:50.200 --> 10:53.040
Do you want it
soundproofed today, boss?

10:53.080 --> 10:57.520
We've got a set at 8:00pm,
yeah, so we need it done
before 8:00pm asap, innit?

10:57.560 --> 10:59.920
-Yeah.
-Cos the last time
we missed a set,

10:59.960 --> 11:03.520
-the London riots happened,
didn't it?
-Yeah. Well...

11:03.560 --> 11:07.000
So it's not something you
really want on your mind,
is it, mate?

11:07.040 --> 11:09.160
-I don't want that.
-It's quite heavy.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.720
What we're going to have
to do, boss... This wall...

11:11.760 --> 11:13.840
I'm going to have
to rip it down.

11:13.880 --> 11:17.720
We're looking at a full
studio revamp here, boss.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.400
Probably gonna cost you
about a grand, I'd say.

11:20.440 --> 11:23.120
I don't like the sound of that.
Do not like the sound of that.

11:23.160 --> 11:27.360
-Right, okay, if you wanted
the cheaper option...
-Which is?

11:29.000 --> 11:30.960
Egg boxes.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.720
[director] Have you ever
soundproofed anything before?

11:33.760 --> 11:37.120
I... [laughs] I tell you what,
I was actually going to
soundproof this place up,

11:37.160 --> 11:39.920
because sometimes me
and Aldona...

11:39.960 --> 11:42.600
It's fucking loud, mate.

11:42.640 --> 11:46.200
Screaming, crying.
No crying. Screaming. Um...

11:46.240 --> 11:49.080
Let me do some equations.
So we've got the door there.

11:49.120 --> 11:54.000
Obviously, carry that three.
So the decibel sound is 70dB...

11:54.040 --> 11:56.080
Power to the eight, Betamax...

11:56.120 --> 11:59.160
You're looking about 200 boxes,
I'd say.

11:59.200 --> 12:02.440
What I'll do, I can do the
technical part. I'll do
the installation.

12:02.480 --> 12:06.200
No problem. I'll need you
fellas to get me the actual
egg boxes themselves.

12:06.240 --> 12:09.400
-Cos I need to get my tools.
-So we're like the muscles
of the operation?

12:09.440 --> 12:12.120
-Yeah, yeah, course we can.
-Okay.

12:12.160 --> 12:15.640
So, um, what we talking
for this then, Chabsie?

12:15.680 --> 12:20.400
-We're just chatting, talking.
-I'm talking damage. What's the
collat, the collateral damage?

12:20.440 --> 12:22.840
I assure you, they'll be
no damage. I will clean up.

12:22.880 --> 12:25.880
-No, mate, listen.
How much is it gonna cost?
-Oh, okay.

12:25.920 --> 12:29.160
I have this shipment, okay,
that I need to get rid of.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.240
So how about, I help you with
the soundproofing material,

12:32.280 --> 12:36.280
you help me by playing a new
advert for my product
on Kurupt FM?

12:36.320 --> 12:40.280
-You tickle me, I'll tickle you.
-No, we don't do adverts on
here. Sorry, mate.

12:40.320 --> 12:44.600
We're strictly about the music.
Tell us more money-wise, cash.

12:46.440 --> 12:48.400
-50 big ones, I'd say.
-50?

12:48.440 --> 12:51.000
Oof! We can squeeze
the advert in, can't we?

12:51.040 --> 12:52.680
-You got it on cassette, yeah?
-Always.

12:52.720 --> 12:54.880
No danger, no danger, yeah.

12:54.920 --> 12:57.040
-It ain't nothing weird, yeah?
-No, no, not weird.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.880
Dealy-oh! Sweet.

12:58.920 --> 13:02.000
You know that bit of dust
at the end of peanuts, yeah?

13:02.040 --> 13:05.720
Basically, that's the best part.
Everybody loves that bit, okay?

13:05.760 --> 13:10.560
There was a manufacturing fault
where all the bags were filled
with nothing but peanut dust.

13:10.600 --> 13:15.320
My uncle managed to get
3,000 boxes of it, yeah,

13:15.360 --> 13:19.120
smuggled to the UK by smuggling
himself inside a bloody crate.

13:19.160 --> 13:22.240
Mental! He got deported,
unfortunately,

13:22.280 --> 13:26.120
but the boxes stayed with me.
I call it Peanut Dust.

13:28.640 --> 13:32.760
[Miche] It's a bit like
doing <i> Cribs,</i> innit?
So this is the bedroom.

13:32.800 --> 13:36.560
Like, this is where, like,
all the magic happens.

13:36.600 --> 13:41.160
Got a hi-fi up there, so I can
lie in bed listening to Kurupt.

13:41.200 --> 13:45.440
It kinda keeps me and Grinds
together, cos he works late
nights and that kind of thing.

13:45.480 --> 13:49.440
So I can lie in bed and listen
to him and he'll feel like
we're together.

13:49.480 --> 13:53.000
Got the view, as you can see.
There's Brentford out there.

13:53.040 --> 13:56.520
It's amazing. When I'm
in here and it's night time,

13:56.560 --> 14:01.440
look out and see the lights,
it's like being in <i> Sex In The</i>
<i>City</i> or something like that.

14:01.480 --> 14:05.080
[Grindah] Right, get as many
egg boxes as you can, yeah?

14:05.120 --> 14:07.280
Back here for seven o'clock.
No fucking around!

14:07.320 --> 14:10.800
Steves, take them, mate.
You really need to wake up.

14:10.840 --> 14:14.360
Basically, what you need to do
is get the car, spin it
round the back,

14:14.400 --> 14:17.080
cos if you go round the front,
the council might be there.

14:17.120 --> 14:20.160
Come on, quick as you can.
You gotta lay low, bruv.

14:20.200 --> 14:23.840
I was gonna say, actually,
we could lie on the backseats
so they can't see us.

14:23.880 --> 14:27.040
Good idea. I'll do that.
You walk, create a diversion.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.560
-Yeah? Steves, come on!
-Steves.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.800
-Come on, Steves!
-Doing my zip.

14:31.840 --> 14:34.720
-Come on!
-Do I really have to walk?

14:34.760 --> 14:37.280
See you boys in a bit.

14:39.000 --> 14:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:49.000 --> 14:51.680
I'm a born leader, yeah?

14:51.720 --> 14:56.240
When I was in jail, I used to
make Beats have to ring me
before any decision was made.

14:56.280 --> 14:58.680
[director]
Have you been to prison?

14:58.720 --> 15:01.520
Yeah, course I've been
in prison. Banged out
a two stretch.

15:01.560 --> 15:06.320
-A two stretch? Is that...?
-Two stretch, innit?

15:06.360 --> 15:09.000
Ain't you seen films?
Two stretch!

15:11.280 --> 15:13.720
It's two weeks, innit?

15:16.080 --> 15:19.200
You usually find, like,
whatever you need in these bins.

15:19.240 --> 15:22.800
I've found loads of stuff
in here before.

15:26.520 --> 15:30.120
Straight away, free range.
It's nice, yeah.

15:32.680 --> 15:37.360
Trick is to just keep
your brain happy.

15:37.400 --> 15:40.160
Cos pills release positive
endolphins

15:40.200 --> 15:43.600
that, basically,
means that you're

15:43.640 --> 15:46.560
never getting any negative
side effects, like.

15:46.600 --> 15:49.960
My brain thanks me, like.
It says, like, "Thank you!"

15:50.000 --> 15:55.560
Like... And it's got
the same voice as me.
It's quite weird.

15:55.600 --> 15:57.440
Yes!

15:57.480 --> 15:59.160
Sick!

16:02.600 --> 16:05.120
Double box. Brilliant!

16:05.160 --> 16:09.000
Exactly what we need. Right,
I'm just going to take
these all out.

16:09.040 --> 16:12.160
Then I can... Oh!

16:12.200 --> 16:15.160
Fuck sakes! What I mean
about fucking eggs, like.

16:15.200 --> 16:20.200
Fucking unpredictable.
All over my Classics, as well.

16:23.480 --> 16:26.040
Right, okay.

16:26.080 --> 16:29.400
Just going to make a little
wall of carrots to keep them in,

16:29.440 --> 16:34.160
so they don't, like, roll off
the fridge and smash all
over the place.

16:34.200 --> 16:37.080
-Hiya!
-Don't come in the kitchen!

16:37.120 --> 16:39.720
Oh, that's a nice
welcome home, innit?

16:39.760 --> 16:42.520
I'm doing work stuff.

16:44.760 --> 16:46.560
What are you doing?

16:46.600 --> 16:49.600
Look, Roche, I'm stressed
out at the moment.

16:49.640 --> 16:52.880
I don't want to mix up
radio with pleasure.

16:52.920 --> 16:56.280
-Business, pleasure don't mix.
-Oh, so this is your business,
is it?

16:56.320 --> 17:00.040
Messing about smashing Craig's
eggs while this lot film you?

17:00.080 --> 17:04.119
Kevin's been living with us
for a few months now.

17:04.160 --> 17:06.839
Uh, I like having him around.

17:06.880 --> 17:10.200
I did think it was going to be
more like having a man
in the house.

17:10.240 --> 17:13.240
<i>But it's not. It's more like
having another kid.</i>

17:13.280 --> 17:15.880
Shall I say to Craig
about the eggs?

17:15.920 --> 17:20.680
I'm not going to. It's a
right nightmare when he hasn't
had his dippy eggs and soldiers.

17:20.720 --> 17:23.760
Craig's quite mature
for his age.

17:23.800 --> 17:28.000
Apart from the tantrums.
I don't know if you've heard.
He can really kick off.

17:28.040 --> 17:30.240
Like proper tantrums.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.840
-[director] What's it
like having a stepson?
-It's hard work.

17:32.880 --> 17:35.400
Cos he's actually a human,
do you know what I mean?

17:35.440 --> 17:38.080
He's got feelings and that.
It's not like...

17:38.120 --> 17:42.160
"Whey, there's my son!" Like.
It's, like, I've got
to care about him.

17:42.200 --> 17:45.120
And if he's upset, I'm fuming.

17:46.840 --> 17:49.760
Here he is. Little Craig.

17:49.800 --> 17:52.600
So he's my son, stepson.

17:54.520 --> 17:56.880
Same smoky eyes though, innit?

17:58.600 --> 18:01.400
Oh, yeah. The T-shirt as well.

18:01.440 --> 18:04.400
"Bringing sexy back".
Likes a bit of Justin.

18:06.880 --> 18:09.200
What's this, Craig?
What you playing?

18:09.240 --> 18:12.200
Looks like GoldenEye
or something.

18:12.240 --> 18:15.240
I'm more a Fifa '98 man myself.

18:15.280 --> 18:18.800
Do you know what I mean?
One of the best games
ever made, I'd say.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.840
Use the grenades!

18:22.880 --> 18:25.520
Funny story, actually. Um...

18:25.560 --> 18:29.080
I once had a lighter
shaped like a grenade.

18:29.120 --> 18:32.720
Yeah. Back in the day, yeah.

18:32.760 --> 18:35.280
I'll see if I can
fish it out for ya.

18:35.320 --> 18:38.040
You might appreciate it.

18:38.080 --> 18:41.200
You got any good lighters
at the minute or...?

18:43.880 --> 18:45.280
Mm.

18:48.480 --> 18:51.120
All right, Craig, mate.
I'll see you in a bit, yeah?

18:52.640 --> 18:54.680
Double, bang!

18:54.720 --> 18:57.560
A few little bits
in there still.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.120
Oh!

18:59.160 --> 19:01.800
Ah, fuck!

19:01.840 --> 19:04.640
All my stuff's
fallen out of my pockets.

19:04.680 --> 19:06.880
Skunk pocket's empty.

19:06.920 --> 19:09.200
[siren wails in the distance]

19:09.240 --> 19:11.480
-There's another one.
-That's what I mean.

19:11.520 --> 19:13.920
It's cool, man. It's just
an ambulance, innit?

19:13.960 --> 19:16.400
Well, they're gonna need an
ambulance if it all kicks off.

19:16.440 --> 19:19.880
-Who's gonna need an ambulance?
-No one's gonna... Here she is!

19:19.920 --> 19:24.200
Ah, my better half.
Not better, but...

19:24.240 --> 19:27.280
-I don't know why people
say that, do you?
-Do you need an ambulance?

19:27.320 --> 19:29.760
-You all right? What's wrong?
-I'm not ill. I'm fine.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.560
Some little mugs are trying it,
do you know what I mean?

19:32.600 --> 19:35.200
Have to go through me first,
so... She knows what I'm like.

19:35.240 --> 19:38.080
Please don't get arrested again.
You know what happened
last time.

19:38.120 --> 19:41.400
I couldn't watch any telly.
I didn't know how to use
it without you.

19:41.440 --> 19:44.880
It was stuck on <i> Dave</i> the whole
time. I missed everything.

19:44.920 --> 19:49.240
Okay, listen, right.
I'm not going anywhere, right?

19:49.280 --> 19:50.520
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.920
I've got radio to think about.

19:52.960 --> 19:56.120
Oh, and her! Angel, here she is.

19:56.160 --> 20:00.000
Look, look at her. Aaah!

20:00.040 --> 20:02.920
You can talk and everything.
I know what you're thinking,
actually.

20:02.960 --> 20:05.960
She's a little bit darker
than I am, but that's because

20:06.000 --> 20:09.360
my great-granddad on my mother's
side was a quarter Cypriot,

20:09.400 --> 20:12.000
so we've all got a sort
of exotic twist, ain't we?

20:12.040 --> 20:15.600
Yeah, yeah, and I used a lot
of fake tan when I was pregnant,

20:15.640 --> 20:18.440
so I think it filtered through.

20:18.480 --> 20:21.160
-Side effects.
-Yeah.

20:21.200 --> 20:23.240
There she is.

20:23.280 --> 20:27.200
-I'm just gonna go
and get some egg boxes.
-Yeah, cool.

20:27.240 --> 20:30.560
Do that thing where you
blow Mummy's head off.

20:30.600 --> 20:33.680
[Chabuds] Looking for
a really good adhesive.

20:33.720 --> 20:37.720
Something really strong.
I think gaffer tape will
do the job, you know.

20:37.760 --> 20:40.480
Probably go for that one.

20:40.520 --> 20:45.520
This standard one. One times
48 mama. Oh, millimetres.

20:45.560 --> 20:47.760
-[phone rings]
-Hold on.

20:47.800 --> 20:50.560
Oh, the old wifey.

20:50.600 --> 20:53.240
Hello, sweetie pie.
You missing me?

20:53.280 --> 20:56.760
Huh? No, no, listen,
they can't be outside.

20:56.800 --> 20:59.880
They can't be outside,
darling. No.

20:59.920 --> 21:03.360
No, listen, they're going
to get wet, baby. Sweet heart!

21:06.280 --> 21:10.480
Just a little emergency at home.
Should be fine, yeah.

21:12.240 --> 21:14.880
Come on! Service! Come on!

21:14.920 --> 21:18.200
You, tiny man child, serve me!
Double time, man!

21:18.240 --> 21:20.600
Say hello to Uncle Bobby!

21:23.440 --> 21:26.680
Do you reckon we've got
enough egg boxes?

21:26.720 --> 21:29.520
-[whispers]
I think it's working.
-Is it?

21:32.040 --> 21:35.160
-Should I say something, like?
-Yes, say something!

21:35.200 --> 21:38.120
Say it into this square here,
yeah?

21:38.160 --> 21:41.080
-Check, one, two, one, two.
-I heard that. Did you?

21:41.120 --> 21:44.160
-Of course I heard it.
-Yeah, we definitely need more.

21:44.200 --> 21:46.840
-How many we got so far?
-About eight.

21:46.880 --> 21:49.200
And one of 'em's flattened.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.520
Fuck's sake! We've got
an hour left as well, like.

21:53.720 --> 21:55.640
Oh, no, no, no!

21:55.680 --> 21:57.880
Not the Peanut Dust!

21:57.920 --> 21:59.760
Aldona!

22:02.400 --> 22:06.360
[they shout in Polish]

22:12.760 --> 22:14.520
Stupid cow, man!

22:18.360 --> 22:20.760
[phone rings]
Hello, man.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.760
-Yeah.
<i>-Hello, Chabsie.</i>

22:22.800 --> 22:25.320
-Yeah, just getting there, mate.
<i>-Turn the telly down.</i>

22:25.360 --> 22:29.760
<i>-Have you got any
extra egg boxes?</i>
-We're getting there, mate.

22:29.800 --> 22:33.440
<i>We need more egg boxes.
Plus it's gonna take ages to
stick 'em on the walls, innit?</i>

22:33.480 --> 22:38.080
Yeah, you know what?
I've got some specialist
adhesive material for you, mate.

22:38.120 --> 22:40.240
<i>More egg boxes. Listen...</i>

22:40.280 --> 22:42.320
Just grab whatever you've
got and come down now.

22:42.360 --> 22:44.000
<i>There's no time, right?</i>

22:44.040 --> 22:46.880
[sound of tape sticking]

22:46.920 --> 22:50.480
Fucking hell, that looks nuts.

22:50.520 --> 22:54.640
-Is that soundproof, yeah?
-It's proper, mate.

23:02.920 --> 23:05.840
Yeah, good. I'm just getting
an even distribution.

23:05.880 --> 23:08.320
One, two, one, two.

23:08.360 --> 23:11.040
One, two, one, two.

23:11.080 --> 23:15.560
-Is this definitely gonna work?
-Yeah, that now, boss,
is fully soundproofed.

23:15.600 --> 23:18.320
I went for the
triple-A approach.

23:18.360 --> 23:22.040
With just a layer of insulation
dust in there as well.

23:22.080 --> 23:25.480
Sweet! Let's hope it does work,
for all our sakes,

23:25.520 --> 23:28.920
cos, if not, Blue Foot are

got to hand himself in.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.760
-What?!
-Well, one of us will have to.

23:34.800 --> 23:38.440
-But you're the main one.
-Exactly, the main one
can't get caught.

23:38.480 --> 23:40.760
This is me.

23:40.800 --> 23:44.760
-It's all mine.
-[director] So how far
does Kurupt FM reach?

23:44.800 --> 23:48.080
As far as the eye
can see, mate. Yeah?

23:48.120 --> 23:50.680
Actually, no, not on that side.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.720
Just mainly on this estate
and a little bit further.

23:53.760 --> 23:56.200
Into Isleworth, but...

23:57.640 --> 24:00.200
-Come on! Out the room.
-Ready?

24:00.240 --> 24:02.960

End of the day, like,

is that we're reaching our

26:31.840 --> 26:34.280
Like, providing a service.

26:34.320 --> 26:36.960
-Like priests.
-Well, not priests.

26:37.000 --> 26:42.440

all right, feeding
them bare fish.

anything. And I'd be above that,
