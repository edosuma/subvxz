WEBVTT

00:19.715 --> 00:22.631
Caught, like, every third word
of that, Papa.

00:22.674 --> 00:25.503
Come help. Pop bag.

00:34.425 --> 00:36.558
Pull it tight. Yeah.

00:47.656 --> 00:49.701
Papa?

00:52.748 --> 00:53.662
Ooh.

01:02.671 --> 01:05.108
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:05.152 --> 01:07.676
♪ Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:07.719 --> 01:10.287
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:10.331 --> 01:11.636
♪ How, how, how, how

01:11.680 --> 01:13.856
♪ Hey, hey

01:19.862 --> 01:21.124
♪ You gotta come on.

01:26.564 --> 01:27.826
HANNAH:
Excuse me.

01:27.870 --> 01:30.002
Always this many lookie-loos
at our crime scenes?

01:30.046 --> 01:31.917
SEBASTIAN: Well, word got out
that the vic was a local.

01:31.961 --> 01:33.789
Petty Officer Aaron Trang.

01:33.832 --> 01:35.878
He grew up on these
docks until he joined

01:35.921 --> 01:37.227
the Office of Naval Research.

01:37.271 --> 01:39.186
Hey. CGIS was first
on the scene.

01:39.229 --> 01:41.405
I called you in as soon as
I saw Trang's naval uniform.

01:41.449 --> 01:42.754
And we appreciate the
Coast Guard's collaboration.

01:42.798 --> 01:44.800
Jurisdiction has been
transferred to NCIS,

01:44.843 --> 01:46.845
but please, keep us
in the loop.

01:46.889 --> 01:48.760
Thank you. Might want
to brace yourself.

01:48.804 --> 01:51.807
Oh, not a point of pride,
Gregorio, but I've seen it all.

01:51.850 --> 01:53.330
Yeah, well, I've seen
Jawsa million times.

01:53.374 --> 01:54.810
I'm never gonna unsee this.

01:55.811 --> 01:56.986
Oh.

01:57.029 --> 01:59.336
Well, takes some
powerful equipment

01:59.380 --> 02:01.077
to do damage like that.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.471
A shrimping boat propeller,
from what I understand.

02:03.514 --> 02:05.255
But after
he was deceased.

02:05.299 --> 02:06.865
Based on water temp
and body bloat,

02:06.909 --> 02:08.911
I'd say he'd been submerged

02:08.954 --> 02:10.304
36, maybe 48 hours.

02:10.347 --> 02:11.870
Trang's CO
reported him UA

02:11.914 --> 02:13.959
from his vessel
here in the Gulf on Monday.

02:14.003 --> 02:15.874
WADE: I won't have
an official COD until

02:15.918 --> 02:18.921
after the autopsy, but I can
tell you this was no accident.

02:18.964 --> 02:22.925
I found a section of rope tied
around the victim's torso.

02:25.797 --> 02:28.191
It's a fisherman's knot.Yeah. The other end

02:28.235 --> 02:29.540
was frayed and broke loose.

02:29.584 --> 02:31.368
Yeah, probably from whatever
weight it was tied to.

02:31.412 --> 02:33.892
Someone wanted Petty Officer
Trang to disappear forever.

02:33.936 --> 02:35.111
Well, that makes it a homicide.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.286
Yeah.

02:36.330 --> 02:37.809
Let's dig into Trang's life,

02:37.853 --> 02:39.159
build him a profile,
see who wanted him dead.

02:39.202 --> 02:40.160
I'm all over it.

02:40.203 --> 02:42.771
Where's Lasalle?

02:45.817 --> 02:48.211
LASALLE:
I need you to calm down.

02:48.255 --> 02:50.779
All right? We'll get to each one
of you as soon as we can.

02:50.822 --> 02:52.998
It won't be fast enough.

02:53.042 --> 02:54.478
If you don't let these fishermen
unload their catch,

02:54.522 --> 02:56.001
you're going to have
a riot on your hands.

02:56.045 --> 02:57.829
Look, it's not my call,
all right? The Coast Guard

02:57.873 --> 02:59.831
gives word when they can
offload their boats.

02:59.875 --> 03:02.225
They need to move their shrimp
to the processing plant
before it spoils.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.053
What they need to do
is answer my questions.

03:04.096 --> 03:05.663
These men are struggling.

03:05.707 --> 03:07.448
We all got problems, all right?

03:07.491 --> 03:10.102
But not as big as that
dead sailor over there.

03:10.146 --> 03:11.103
Hey, hey!

03:11.147 --> 03:12.801
Back off! Back off!

03:12.844 --> 03:14.237
Let's go! Back off!

03:14.281 --> 03:17.371
Let's go. Clear out. Clear out.

03:17.414 --> 03:19.634
Lasalle.

03:24.073 --> 03:26.031
Sorry about that.

03:26.075 --> 03:29.861
You're just doing your job.

03:29.905 --> 03:32.647
You have seemed
a little on edge lately.

03:32.690 --> 03:34.692
Is there anything I can do?

03:34.736 --> 03:37.956
I appreciate that,
but unless you can get the IRS

03:38.000 --> 03:40.524
off my family's back,
I'm out of options.

03:40.568 --> 03:42.744
I thought the tax fraud
investigation was over.

03:42.787 --> 03:45.834
It is, as of this afternoon,
when I go in

03:45.877 --> 03:48.489
and hear their findings.

03:48.532 --> 03:50.882
That's stressful.

03:50.926 --> 03:53.233
Yeah, at best,
I'm walking into an ambush.

03:53.276 --> 03:55.278
You should get out of here.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.628
Clear your head.No, ma'am.

03:57.672 --> 04:00.109
I'm gonna stay here until
we find a lead on this case.

04:00.152 --> 04:01.415
Well, we might already have one.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.199
Trang and his cousin Amy
were close.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.983
She's coming in on their
family shrimp boat right now.

04:05.027 --> 04:07.029
I'll stay and see
what she has to say.Oh, no.

04:07.072 --> 04:08.813
And muscle in on my
girl time with Gregorio?

04:08.857 --> 04:10.032
I don't think so.

04:10.075 --> 04:11.425
We got this, Chris.

04:13.035 --> 04:14.471
Take care of you, all right?

04:21.130 --> 04:24.742
Mr. Trang, do you understand
what we're saying?

04:24.786 --> 04:26.614
Your nephew is dead.

04:26.657 --> 04:27.789
Yes, I understand.

04:30.357 --> 04:33.621
When did you last speak
with Aaron?
Been a while.

04:33.664 --> 04:35.579
There was distance between us
when he joined the Navy.

04:35.623 --> 04:37.320
You didn't approve?

04:37.364 --> 04:38.713
He was supposed to
take over this boat.

04:38.756 --> 04:40.584
To follow in my footsteps.

04:40.628 --> 04:42.151
His father's, too.

04:42.194 --> 04:43.805
Where are his parents?

04:43.848 --> 04:45.285
Katrina took them.

04:45.328 --> 04:46.982
HANNAH:
We have heard

04:47.025 --> 04:50.420
things have been difficult
lately for fishermen like you.

04:50.464 --> 04:52.379
Hard enough scrounging
for scraps.

04:52.422 --> 04:55.295
But now, our fishing
grounds are polluted.

04:55.338 --> 04:58.036
We're on the water seven days
a week, and barely surviving.

04:58.080 --> 05:00.430
We were told your daughter
Amy was close with Aaron.

05:00.474 --> 05:02.084
We need to speak with her.

05:02.127 --> 05:03.303
Is she here?

05:03.346 --> 05:04.913
She was supposed to be.

05:04.956 --> 05:06.175
Never showed up.

05:06.218 --> 05:07.350
And that doesn't concern you?

05:07.394 --> 05:08.395
My daughter is stubborn.

05:08.438 --> 05:10.179
She does what she wants,

05:10.222 --> 05:11.615
whether it concerns
me or not.Mr. Trang,

05:11.659 --> 05:12.921
your nephew
was murdered.

05:12.964 --> 05:14.444
Amy might
know by whom.

05:14.488 --> 05:15.358
She might be in danger herself.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.447
We need to find her, now.

05:23.888 --> 05:25.412
King.

05:25.455 --> 05:27.370
What are you
doing here?

05:27.414 --> 05:29.503
Thought you could use
some moral support.

05:29.546 --> 05:31.896
How'd you even know
it was judgment day?

05:31.940 --> 05:33.898
Silvera called me, gave me
a heads-up about the meeting.

05:33.942 --> 05:35.335
Professional courtesy.

05:35.378 --> 05:37.380
Or a fair warning
how bad it'll be.

05:37.424 --> 05:38.990
I appreciate
you coming.

05:39.034 --> 05:40.470
Know you're busy
with your new job,

05:40.514 --> 05:41.689
but, uh, I can handle this.

05:41.732 --> 05:44.431
You can, but you don't have to.

05:44.474 --> 05:47.521
At least not alone.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.394
Eight million dollars?

05:51.438 --> 05:53.657
Actually, with interest
and penalties,

05:53.701 --> 05:56.399
the Lasalle Enterprises
liability is closer to ten.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.358
This is crazy.

05:58.401 --> 06:00.142
You might as well take my blood
while you're at it.

06:00.185 --> 06:01.578
Christopher,
she's not the enemy.

06:01.622 --> 06:03.624
And neither was my father.

06:03.667 --> 06:05.495
And he wasn't a thief.

06:05.539 --> 06:08.019
Findings are not an official
indictment of your father,

06:08.063 --> 06:10.021
but they do support
the government's claims

06:10.065 --> 06:11.675
of delinquent taxes.

06:11.719 --> 06:13.895
How long does he have
to settle up?

06:13.938 --> 06:15.766
The first installment is due
by the end of the month.

06:15.810 --> 06:19.335
The company's on fumes as it is.
What if we can't pay?

06:19.379 --> 06:22.425
We'll have no choice
but to recoup the monies owed

06:22.469 --> 06:25.123
in other ways:
garnishment of earnings,

06:25.167 --> 06:27.474
seizure of assets...And since now
I'm technically the boss,

06:27.517 --> 06:29.867
you'd come after my assets next.

06:29.911 --> 06:31.608
That shouldn't be
your central concern.

06:35.133 --> 06:36.787
What's going on, King?

06:36.831 --> 06:40.530
You're a federal agent
with top secret clearance.

06:40.574 --> 06:45.056
Carrying that much debt could
make you a target for blackmail.

06:45.100 --> 06:48.451
You'd revoke my clearance.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.935
Can't do your job without it.

06:53.978 --> 06:55.632
Not that you'd care,

06:55.676 --> 06:58.330
but I'd take a bullet
before selling out my country.

06:58.374 --> 07:00.681
I do care,
Special Agent Lasalle.

07:00.724 --> 07:03.553
And I sincerely wish my hands
weren't tied, but the numbers

07:03.597 --> 07:06.948
don't lie, and all indications
are that your father did.

07:06.991 --> 07:09.472
You're wrong about him.Uh...

07:14.390 --> 07:16.566
I don't want him
to lose his badge,

07:16.610 --> 07:18.568
but I've got limited options.

07:18.612 --> 07:22.833
Maybe there's a way we can both
get what we want.

07:24.052 --> 07:25.836
Chris.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.796
I know what you're gonna say,
King, but I'm not giving up.

07:28.839 --> 07:30.624
Exactly why I called Hannah.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.582
You'll stand down from the team
for the time being.

07:32.626 --> 07:33.975
What, you're
suspending me?No.

07:34.018 --> 07:36.499
I'm giving you
some time off.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.936
Need your full attention
focused on this.

07:38.980 --> 07:42.244
It's the only way we're gonna
figure this IRS thing out.

07:42.287 --> 07:45.465
Look, I didn't
survive three bullets

07:45.508 --> 07:47.467
to push paper around.

07:47.510 --> 07:49.643
I'm here because
of my family.

07:49.686 --> 07:51.514
And that's you.Well, I spent months

07:51.558 --> 07:54.038
searching for answers
to this missing money.

07:54.082 --> 07:56.040
Couldn't find anything useful.

07:56.084 --> 07:58.739
That's because you didn't have
the entire IRS case files.

07:58.782 --> 08:01.089
Put it in the back
of the truck, fellas.

08:01.132 --> 08:02.525
Thank you.

08:04.005 --> 08:06.921
This "Special Agent
in Charge" title

08:06.964 --> 08:09.401
comes with
some serious perks.
Yeah.

08:09.445 --> 08:10.968
Well, we got three days,

08:11.012 --> 08:13.405
boxes of evidence and a pair
of stubborn investigators

08:13.449 --> 08:15.538
who are gonna find
that missing money

08:15.582 --> 08:17.714
and prove your
father's innocence.

08:21.544 --> 08:22.850
Amy Trang is no angel.

08:22.893 --> 08:24.895
Her juvie rap sheet
includes petty theft,

08:24.939 --> 08:26.897
trespassing,
criminal mischief.

08:26.941 --> 08:29.334
Patton tracked her cell
to her parents' house.

08:29.378 --> 08:31.511
Phone was there;
Amy was not.

08:31.554 --> 08:32.860
Since when have you seen
a 17-year-old

08:32.903 --> 08:34.078
go anywhere without their phone?

08:34.122 --> 08:35.602
Since absolutely never.Yeah.

08:35.645 --> 08:37.560
NOPD still canvassing
Village de L'Est?

08:37.604 --> 08:39.562
Nobody's seen her. And if
they have, they're not talking.

08:39.606 --> 08:41.129
Well, they're
protecting their own.

08:41.172 --> 08:43.435
Or keeping
their dirty laundry private.

08:43.479 --> 08:45.525
I've seen it firsthand
how immigrants

08:45.568 --> 08:47.788
can feel pulled
in two different directions.

08:47.831 --> 08:49.920
My parents clung to their past

08:49.964 --> 08:52.706
while they pushed me
into my own future.

08:52.749 --> 08:54.011
Yeah, sounds like
my grandparents.

08:54.055 --> 08:56.579
They left Sicily,
but it never left them.

08:56.623 --> 08:57.928
SEBASTIAN:
Dumped Aaron Trang's
phone records.

08:57.972 --> 08:59.539
Found a disturbing text chain

08:59.582 --> 09:02.324
between him and Amy the
day before he disappeared.

09:02.367 --> 09:03.760
Aaron told his little cousin

09:03.804 --> 09:05.806
to slow her roll
on something shady.

09:06.850 --> 09:08.460
"Don't do this.

09:08.504 --> 09:10.593
You and the guys are in
enough trouble already."

09:10.637 --> 09:13.291
GREGORIO:
"You have no idea how dangerous
and ruthless these people are."

09:13.335 --> 09:14.815
PATTON:
Last thing he told her was

09:14.858 --> 09:16.338
he was gonna
handle them himself,

09:16.381 --> 09:17.731
that he was getting the proof.

09:17.774 --> 09:19.080
Proof of what?Well, whatever it is,

09:19.123 --> 09:20.603
it probably got Aaron killed.

09:20.647 --> 09:23.214
If we don't find Amy fast,
she could be next.

09:23.258 --> 09:24.868
Aaron said "Amy's guys."

09:24.912 --> 09:27.567
Whatever she's up to,
she's not doing it alone.

09:27.610 --> 09:29.481
Hey, Patton...Already feeling you, boss.

09:29.525 --> 09:30.657
There you go.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.702
Amy's last two contacts.

09:32.746 --> 09:34.878
Hey, both numbers just pinged

09:34.922 --> 09:36.227
off the same cell tower.

09:36.271 --> 09:37.402
They're at
the shrimping docks.

09:39.883 --> 09:43.234
♪

09:43.278 --> 09:45.846
Movement
on the ladder!

09:45.889 --> 09:47.325
WOMAN: It's
the cops! Run!

09:47.935 --> 09:49.719
Federal agents!

09:56.508 --> 09:57.727
Stop climbing.

09:57.771 --> 09:58.772
Come down here now.

10:06.518 --> 10:07.868
Amy Trang.

10:07.911 --> 10:10.392
You are one
hard woman to find.

10:10.435 --> 10:12.437
Let's go.

10:14.570 --> 10:15.702
SEBASTIAN: All right,
we got the others.

10:15.745 --> 10:16.964
HANNAH: We've got
a bigger problem.

10:17.007 --> 10:19.836
Everybody off the boat now!

10:33.110 --> 10:34.895
Amy.

10:34.938 --> 10:36.940
I need you
to understand

10:36.984 --> 10:39.334
how serious the charges are
against you.

10:39.377 --> 10:42.467
You mean criminal trespassing
with an intent to commit

10:42.511 --> 10:44.992
malicious destruction of
property via felony possession

10:45.035 --> 10:46.428
of an explosive
device?

10:46.471 --> 10:47.690
Someone's been studying
the penal code.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.387
You don't seem too concerned.

10:49.431 --> 10:52.695
Everyone knows
the juvie system is a joke.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.523
I'll get a slap
on the wrist

10:54.566 --> 10:55.785
and probation.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.221
Yeah, for the
lesser charges maybe,

10:57.265 --> 10:59.833
but not for the two counts
of attempted murder.

11:01.312 --> 11:02.618
There were a couple
of crew members

11:02.662 --> 11:04.228
below deck on that boat
you tried to blow up.

11:04.272 --> 11:06.448
Guess you don't know everything.

11:06.491 --> 11:08.493
In Louisiana,
you will be tried as an adult,

11:08.537 --> 11:10.278
and with the amount
of evidence against you,

11:10.321 --> 11:12.280
you will spend the next
30 years behind bars.

11:12.323 --> 11:14.282
If you're lucky.

11:16.284 --> 11:19.113
But our mission failed.
We didn't hurt anyone.

11:19.156 --> 11:22.377
You're still guilty of intent,
but if you cooperate,

11:22.420 --> 11:23.944
maybe we can help you.

11:25.336 --> 11:26.816
Was the sabotage
of the boat

11:26.860 --> 11:29.253
related to the murder
of your cousin Aaron?

11:31.299 --> 11:33.910
Aaron's dead?

11:38.828 --> 11:40.743
It was them.

11:40.787 --> 11:41.788
It was Triton.

11:41.831 --> 11:44.442
They killed him.Triton Fisheries?

11:44.486 --> 11:46.009
They've been trying to destroy
Village de L'Est for years.

11:46.053 --> 11:47.358
They've been poisoning

11:47.402 --> 11:49.230
our fishing grounds,
and nobody was willing

11:49.273 --> 11:51.493
to do anything about it,
not our parents or the cops,

11:51.536 --> 11:53.364
so we decided to send Triton
a message.

11:53.408 --> 11:54.757
We decided to fight back.

11:54.801 --> 11:55.932
Aaron was helping?
No.

11:55.976 --> 11:57.368
He was trying to stop us.

11:57.412 --> 11:58.848
Said he found
a better way to prove

11:58.892 --> 12:00.937
what they were doing to us.How?

12:00.981 --> 12:02.286
I don't know.

12:02.330 --> 12:03.679
But you have

12:03.723 --> 12:05.594
to arrest them all.There's no proof

12:05.637 --> 12:07.378
that Triton was involved.

12:07.422 --> 12:09.511
Triton's destroyed dozens
of fishing communities

12:09.554 --> 12:10.773
just like ours.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.732
They'll do anything for money,

12:12.775 --> 12:14.559
even murder innocent people.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.131
Thank you.

12:21.175 --> 12:22.785
I'm looking
for Amy Trang.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.569
Yeah, I remember you
from the docks.

12:24.613 --> 12:26.746
Are you a relative?My name is Eddie Dao.

12:26.789 --> 12:28.704
I'm from Village de L'Est.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.706
The parents of the teenagers
you've arrested

12:30.750 --> 12:32.795
asked me to come
check on them.

12:32.839 --> 12:33.665
So you're a lawyer?

12:33.709 --> 12:35.493
Just a concerned member

12:35.537 --> 12:36.625
of the community.

12:36.668 --> 12:37.931
Look, I know these kids.

12:37.974 --> 12:39.628
Especially Amy.

12:39.671 --> 12:42.587
She's not evil, just angry.

12:42.631 --> 12:45.808
You know, anger doesn't really
justify what she was planning.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.288
People could've died.

12:47.331 --> 12:48.680
You need to understand

12:48.724 --> 12:51.074
the situation our
people are in.

12:51.118 --> 12:53.947
Families losing
businesses, homes.

12:53.990 --> 12:57.820
It's bleak, and the kids are
the most vulnerable ones.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.735
There's no justification
for violence,

12:59.779 --> 13:02.390
but I beg you to see
Amy and her friends

13:02.433 --> 13:04.566
as the frightened
children they are.

13:06.829 --> 13:08.831
Reach out to the D.A.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.833
Let them know the
suspects are cooperating.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.879
We're gonna
recommend probation.

13:12.922 --> 13:15.925
I will personally vouch we won't
have any more trouble from them.

13:17.318 --> 13:19.015
Copy that.

13:19.059 --> 13:20.712
Mr. Dao, I'm sympathetic

13:20.756 --> 13:22.323
to your plight.

13:22.366 --> 13:25.195
No one should feel
that kind of despair, but...

13:25.239 --> 13:29.025
recklessly lashing out,
it just makes things worse.

13:29.069 --> 13:31.245
Please share that message
with the community, okay?

13:31.288 --> 13:33.116
I will.
And thank you.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.726
Okay.

13:37.338 --> 13:39.557
You're taking a chance
vouching for these kids.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.864
Look, I have sat across
from true extremists,

13:41.908 --> 13:44.562
people who have no regard
for who they hurt.

13:44.606 --> 13:46.347
This is just
not these kids.

13:46.390 --> 13:48.871
I mean, especially Amy.

13:48.915 --> 13:51.874
She's just a confused
girl that's trying to...

13:51.918 --> 13:54.746
solve a problem
that has no solution.

13:54.790 --> 13:57.575
You think she's right
about Triton Fisheries?Maybe. I don't know.

13:57.619 --> 13:59.621
But we're gonna need more
than neighborhood gossip

13:59.664 --> 14:01.666
to accuse a corporate
giant of murder.

14:03.233 --> 14:05.932
All right, this is how my father
ran the business in the ground.

14:05.975 --> 14:08.935
Handwritten invoices
and Post-it notes.

14:08.978 --> 14:10.545
I mean, how did he
embezzle $8 million

14:10.588 --> 14:12.025
when he couldn't even use
a computer?

14:12.068 --> 14:13.940
Yeah, well, follow the money,
we'll knew the answer.

14:13.983 --> 14:16.768
But you need to make peace with
the truth, no matter what it is.

14:16.812 --> 14:18.945
PATTON:
Triple P

14:18.988 --> 14:20.947
ready to drop a bomb on you.

14:20.990 --> 14:21.948
Boom!

14:21.991 --> 14:23.384
Scanned five years

14:23.427 --> 14:25.038
of accounting records,
and I used an algorithm

14:25.081 --> 14:26.909
to do what the human eye can't.

14:26.953 --> 14:27.910
Well, what'd you find?

14:27.954 --> 14:28.911
The missing $8 million.

14:28.955 --> 14:31.479
At least where it came from.

14:31.522 --> 14:34.961
PRIDE: Looks like hundreds
of small, internal transactions

14:35.004 --> 14:38.355
moved back and forth
between accounts

14:38.399 --> 14:39.791
I'm still working on that.

14:39.835 --> 14:42.664
But I do know where
the transfers initiated from.

14:42.707 --> 14:44.492
Same IP address and user.

14:44.535 --> 14:47.408
An accountant, Leila Addison.

14:47.451 --> 14:49.845
She quit three weeks
after my father died.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.499
That could be a coincidence.

14:51.542 --> 14:53.501
Or it could be she embezzled
the money herself

14:53.544 --> 14:56.286
and set him up
as the fall guy.Where is she now?

14:56.330 --> 14:58.245
Heh. Closer than you think.

14:58.288 --> 15:00.377
She moved to New Orleans
a few months ago.

15:00.421 --> 15:03.076
Let's go pay her a
little welcome visit.

15:07.602 --> 15:08.951
MAN:
Heard about
that sailor's accident

15:08.995 --> 15:11.998
on the news--
really sad story.

15:12.041 --> 15:14.696
Oh, no, it wasn't an
accident, Mr. Wilkins.

15:14.739 --> 15:16.741
Petty Officer Trang
was dumped in the Gulf

15:16.785 --> 15:17.917
after he was murdered.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.309
The Vietnamese fishermen
seem to think

15:19.353 --> 15:20.963
Triton had something
to do with it.

15:21.007 --> 15:23.574
Desperate men spin
desperate tales.

15:23.618 --> 15:25.794
Oh, so you're aware of
the problems they were having?

15:25.837 --> 15:26.969
I've been
where they're at.

15:27.013 --> 15:29.145
Busting my tail
to barely make ends meet.

15:29.189 --> 15:30.973
Tough times,
it's much easier

15:31.017 --> 15:32.453
to point fingers

15:32.496 --> 15:34.020
than take responsibility.So your company's not trying

15:34.063 --> 15:36.761
to run the mom-and-pop fishing
companies out of business?

15:36.805 --> 15:37.980
Of course not.

15:38.024 --> 15:39.547
There's enough fish

15:39.590 --> 15:41.114
in that big old
ocean for everyone.

15:41.157 --> 15:44.508
Oh, yeah, it is big, huh?

15:44.552 --> 15:46.206
Triton is, uh,

15:46.249 --> 15:47.947
based in Texas, right?

15:47.990 --> 15:49.296
Corpus Christi.

15:49.339 --> 15:50.950
GREGORIO: Oh, so your
trawlers must burn

15:50.993 --> 15:53.213
a lot of diesel making that
trip from here to there.

15:53.256 --> 15:56.042
Oh, yeah, a significant
expense spared if you got

15:56.085 --> 15:59.001
a mid-Gulf distribution center
in New Orleans.

15:59.045 --> 16:02.004
One maybe just like
the Vietnamese processing plant?

16:02.048 --> 16:03.832
Not a secret.

16:03.875 --> 16:06.748
We made a fair offer
to buy 'em out.

16:06.791 --> 16:09.751
Even invited the local
shrimpers to join our crews.

16:09.794 --> 16:12.014
Theysaid no.
GREGORIO:
So maybe you decided

16:12.058 --> 16:14.277
to force their hand
by poisoning their waters

16:14.321 --> 16:17.889
to make it impossible for them
to stay in business.

16:17.933 --> 16:21.458
You're wrong. If anything,
they're harassing us.

16:21.502 --> 16:22.894
Vandalizing our boats.

16:22.938 --> 16:24.461
Now an attempted bombing.

16:24.505 --> 16:26.550
I feel bad for what's
happened to those fishermen,

16:26.594 --> 16:29.292
I do, but they
keep coming at us,

16:29.336 --> 16:31.294
and we'll do
whatever it takes...

16:31.338 --> 16:34.080
to defend our property.

16:40.695 --> 16:43.002
This is Leila Addison's address.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.528
Not exactly a mansion.

16:47.571 --> 16:49.660
Well, you steal $8 million,

16:49.704 --> 16:52.924
you might want to lay low
a little before spending it.

16:52.968 --> 16:54.796
Finished all
my homework, Ma.

16:54.839 --> 16:58.017
Can I watch TV now?How about you do
a little reading instead,

16:58.060 --> 16:59.279
okay, sweetie pie?Okay.

17:01.498 --> 17:04.110
Look, much as a single mother
could use some extra cash,

17:04.153 --> 17:06.112
I didn't take a penny
that wasn't earned.

17:06.155 --> 17:07.678
A lot more than pennies

17:07.722 --> 17:08.984
passed through your computer,
Ms. Addison.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.246
I am an accountant.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.422
Moving money around
is literally the job.

17:12.466 --> 17:13.815
But not stealing it.

17:13.858 --> 17:16.035
I would never do that
to your father.

17:16.078 --> 17:18.037
I loved working for him.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.995
All of his employees did.Then...

17:20.039 --> 17:22.128
why'd you leave
the company, Leila?

17:22.171 --> 17:25.566
After Beau passed, I couldn't
bear watching it all fall apart.

17:25.609 --> 17:28.395
Especially
after the IRS swept in.

17:28.438 --> 17:30.832
Then why'd you move
to New Orleans?

17:30.875 --> 17:32.268
I grew up here.

17:32.312 --> 17:34.879
A bookkeeping position came up
in my old church.

17:34.923 --> 17:36.359
Felt like a sign from above.

17:36.403 --> 17:39.101
Mm-hmm. Time for a change.

17:39.145 --> 17:40.059
Time for stability.

17:40.102 --> 17:42.583
Oil industry is feast or famine.

17:42.626 --> 17:43.975
Beau expanded during
the last boom,

17:44.019 --> 17:45.586
but when things
went bust,

17:45.629 --> 17:48.110
he couldn't keep up,
and the layoffs began.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.025
Well, he didn't lay youoff.Yeah.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.027
Because I was helping him
keep the doors open,

17:52.071 --> 17:54.116
even if that meant
trimming the fat

17:54.160 --> 17:56.031
to the bone.
Your father took on

17:56.075 --> 17:58.120
the work of half
a dozen people.

17:58.164 --> 17:59.687
He even paid the bills himself.

17:59.730 --> 18:00.949
Wasn't that your job?

18:00.992 --> 18:02.168
It used to be...

18:02.211 --> 18:04.039
until things got tight.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.258
And after that,
I would just transfer

18:05.301 --> 18:06.781
the funds into an account,

18:06.824 --> 18:09.131
and he would distribute
the money as he saw fit.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.612
And let me guess-- you ain't got
a clue where that money went.

18:11.655 --> 18:12.830
He didn't tell me.

18:12.874 --> 18:14.136
And I didn't ask.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.355
We trusted
each other.

18:15.398 --> 18:17.139
I knew he was doing

18:17.183 --> 18:19.315
everything he could to save
Lasalle Enterprises.

18:19.359 --> 18:21.187
And when he got back
from Jamaica, there was

18:21.230 --> 18:22.710
an optimism
in his eyes

18:22.753 --> 18:25.104
that I hadn't seen
in a really long time.

18:25.147 --> 18:27.193
Jamaica?

18:27.236 --> 18:29.151
My father

18:29.195 --> 18:32.067
Yeah, he went
right before he died.

18:32.111 --> 18:35.201
Why would someone go on vacation

18:35.244 --> 18:38.639
when their business is
on the verge of collapse?

18:41.032 --> 18:42.947
GREGORIO:
Triton has a long history

18:42.991 --> 18:44.297
of steamrolling smaller
fishing communities,

18:44.340 --> 18:45.559
and Brett Wilkins

18:45.602 --> 18:47.038
is the field general.

18:47.082 --> 18:48.518
Arrests for harassment
intimidation, stalking.

18:48.562 --> 18:50.999
But the cases are
always tossed.

18:51.042 --> 18:53.784
Yeah, well, thanks
to Triton's deep legal pockets.

18:53.828 --> 18:56.135
This is a war for total
industry dominance.

18:56.178 --> 18:57.701
Hey, Doc.

18:57.745 --> 18:59.181
Ah, you're just in time.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.227
It appears

19:01.270 --> 19:02.967
Petty Officer Trang
did drown,

19:03.011 --> 19:04.186
but not in the Gulf.

19:04.230 --> 19:05.492
I found potable water
in his lungs.

19:05.535 --> 19:07.276
He drowned on land?The lung tissue

19:07.320 --> 19:09.844
showed signs of cold burn,

19:09.887 --> 19:12.760
which suggests extended contact
with ice water.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.762
Bruising on the back
of his neck is the result

19:14.805 --> 19:15.763
of being...

19:15.806 --> 19:17.330
held under for some time.

19:17.373 --> 19:19.723
What about this imprint on
his face-- looks like a...

19:19.767 --> 19:21.160
a pattern?

19:21.203 --> 19:22.204
Impression marks.

19:22.248 --> 19:23.249
Something was pressed

19:23.292 --> 19:25.164
against the skin

19:25.207 --> 19:26.469
after his death.

19:26.513 --> 19:28.254
Trang may have
given us a clue

19:28.297 --> 19:30.299
straight from Davy
Jones' Locker.

19:30.343 --> 19:32.649
Do you have any idea
how weird you are?

19:32.693 --> 19:34.173
Yes.

19:34.216 --> 19:37.001
So, I took a mold
of Trang's facial muscles,

19:37.045 --> 19:40.440
and I enhanced
the imprint.

19:40.483 --> 19:41.528
Asian characters.

19:41.571 --> 19:43.660
Vietnamese logograms,
to be exact.

19:43.704 --> 19:46.185
Yeah, and when translated,
it means...

19:46.228 --> 19:47.925
New Dawn. His uncle's boat.

19:47.969 --> 19:48.926
SEBASTIAN:
Yeah.

19:54.410 --> 19:56.020
HANNAH:
We're too late.

19:56.064 --> 19:59.720
If there was any evidence
on board, it's gone now.

20:00.764 --> 20:03.027
It's Triton!

20:03.071 --> 20:04.333
You know this is Triton!

20:04.377 --> 20:05.595
Triton!

20:24.397 --> 20:27.051
Why are you keeping me here?

20:27.095 --> 20:29.837
I am the victim.You recognize this, Mr. Trang?

20:31.012 --> 20:33.797
It's the New Dawn
commemoration plaque.

20:33.841 --> 20:35.103
GREGORIO: Yeah. Aaron's
dead body was lying on it

20:35.146 --> 20:38.324
before being dumped in
the Gulf from your boat.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.500
That's not possible.GREGORIO:
GPS shows

20:40.543 --> 20:42.110
two recent
middle-of-the-night trips

20:42.153 --> 20:43.590
to your shrimping grounds.

20:43.633 --> 20:45.069
HANNAH: First trip
was three nights ago.

20:45.113 --> 20:47.071
The next was the night
Aaron was killed.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.424
Aaron was like a son to me.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.077
I would never hurt him.

20:53.121 --> 20:55.210
Mr. Trang, I believe that.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.041
But I also think you know more
than you're telling us.

21:00.084 --> 21:03.000
I have the utmost respect

21:03.044 --> 21:04.611
for your loyalty to your family.

21:04.654 --> 21:06.352
It reminds me a lot of my own.

21:06.395 --> 21:08.963
But the best way
for you to honor Aaron

21:09.006 --> 21:11.270
is to help us find his killer.

21:16.927 --> 21:18.929
He came to me.

21:20.496 --> 21:23.064
Wanted to clear
the air between us.

21:23.107 --> 21:25.588
Then he asked to
borrow the boat.

21:25.632 --> 21:28.112
But only that one time.

21:28.156 --> 21:29.462
Did he say why he needed it?

21:29.505 --> 21:31.594
Only that he was trying
to save our way of life.

21:31.638 --> 21:34.510
Aaron and I had
our differences,

21:34.554 --> 21:36.120
but I'll always be proud of him.

21:37.470 --> 21:41.038
He deserved better than this.

21:41.082 --> 21:44.520
You're right, Mr. Trang, he did.

21:44.564 --> 21:48.045
Man, it look like
your pop's Jamaica trip

21:48.089 --> 21:49.351
wasn't a onetime thing.

21:49.395 --> 21:51.310
He was flying down
every couple of months.

21:51.353 --> 21:53.137
Why didn't he tell me?

21:53.181 --> 21:55.314
My guess is he was trying
to protect you.

21:55.357 --> 21:58.186
From what?
And why Jamaica?

21:58.229 --> 22:01.145
To cover up his
real destination.

22:03.191 --> 22:05.933
You don't have to protect me, P.

22:05.976 --> 22:08.065
I want to know.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.374
Grand Cayman.

22:12.418 --> 22:14.550
It's only an hour charter
out of Kingston.

22:14.594 --> 22:16.552
That old selfish son of a...

22:16.596 --> 22:18.424
Hang on, now, Christopher.

22:18.467 --> 22:19.990
We don't have the
full story yet.

22:20.034 --> 22:21.644
No, I'm done pretending, King.

22:21.688 --> 22:25.431
All right, Beau Lasalle
was as guilty as sin.

22:25.474 --> 22:27.650
Set himself up
a secret retirement fund

22:27.694 --> 22:30.174
in a untouchable Cayman bank.

22:30.218 --> 22:31.741
Let the truth come out.

22:31.785 --> 22:34.744
All right, the family name can
be mud, but not the company.

22:34.788 --> 22:37.268
These are good, honest,
hardworking people.

22:37.312 --> 22:38.661
Need to make this right

22:38.705 --> 22:40.402
so Lasalle Enterprises
stays afloat.

22:40.446 --> 22:42.012
How?

22:42.056 --> 22:44.145
Gonna find every penny
my father stole

22:44.188 --> 22:46.016
and pay off those taxes.

22:47.017 --> 22:48.410
I'm going to see Leila Addison.

22:48.454 --> 22:50.107
If she didn't help
steal the money,

22:50.151 --> 22:52.327
maybe she can help get it back.

22:53.372 --> 22:56.157
Hey. Ginny.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.115
Special Agent Pride.

22:58.159 --> 23:01.118
I thought you were working
from home today.
I am.

23:01.162 --> 23:04.470
Just came by to grab a
few files off my desk.

23:05.819 --> 23:08.212
Top secret project?

23:11.041 --> 23:14.001
It's a practice test
for night school.

23:14.044 --> 23:15.263
The phones have been dead,

23:15.306 --> 23:16.699
so I figured...That's okay.

23:16.743 --> 23:18.484
I won't tell the boss.

23:18.527 --> 23:21.225
What you got?

23:22.575 --> 23:25.099
Masters in Criminology?

23:25.142 --> 23:28.145
With an emphasis
in investigative technique,

23:28.189 --> 23:30.670
procedure and evidence.

23:30.713 --> 23:32.280
Good for you.

23:32.323 --> 23:34.413
I only have
three semesters left.

23:34.456 --> 23:36.023
Well, don't let
me slow you down.

23:36.066 --> 23:37.241
Ginny, you might want

23:37.285 --> 23:38.460
to check number six.

23:38.504 --> 23:39.461
I think it's a trick question.

23:47.121 --> 23:49.558
Gregorio.

23:49.602 --> 23:51.604
Pride.
Hey.

23:51.647 --> 23:54.911
So, this is how
the other half lives. Fancy.

23:54.955 --> 23:57.653
Well, it's not the
NCIS squad room,

23:57.697 --> 24:00.395
but it has a certain charm.

24:00.439 --> 24:03.050
If you say so.

24:03.093 --> 24:04.965
You all right?
Yeah.

24:05.008 --> 24:07.228
I just need
some perspective on a case.

24:07.271 --> 24:10.057
The murdered Naval
Research officer?

24:10.100 --> 24:13.452
Yeah. The victim's uncle is
a legit suspect, but I just...

24:13.495 --> 24:15.976
it just doesn't
feel right in my gut.

24:16.019 --> 24:16.846
What does Hannah think?

24:16.890 --> 24:18.674
She's on the same page.

24:18.718 --> 24:21.024
Sounds like you already got

24:21.068 --> 24:23.244
all the perspective
you really need.

24:23.287 --> 24:25.899
Maybe.

24:25.942 --> 24:27.988
Or maybe I just missed
your face.

24:29.032 --> 24:31.078
I miss yours, too.

24:31.121 --> 24:33.210
Hannah's great.
She's just not you.

24:33.254 --> 24:36.257
: Maybe...
maybe that's a good thing.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.651
And it balances out
the boy/girl ratio,

24:38.694 --> 24:41.088
and I'm pretty sure
Sebastian's afraid of her.

24:41.131 --> 24:44.091
:
That's a win-win situation.

24:44.134 --> 24:46.136
If you say so.

24:49.575 --> 24:51.794
You're worried about Lasalle?

24:51.838 --> 24:53.492
It's that obvious?

24:54.580 --> 24:56.277
You could call.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.800
Yeah, no, he's got a lot
on his plate.

24:57.844 --> 24:59.323
I was hoping
you could fill me in.

24:59.367 --> 25:02.022
Doesn't look too good
for him right now,

25:02.065 --> 25:03.893
but Chris is a fighter.

25:03.937 --> 25:04.894
Hell, yeah, he is.

25:04.938 --> 25:06.548
Yeah. One way or another,

25:06.592 --> 25:09.116
he's gonna get
the answers he needs.Yeah.

25:09.159 --> 25:11.161
I just hope whatever
those answers are,

25:11.205 --> 25:13.512
he can live with them.

25:13.555 --> 25:15.601
SEBASTIAN:
I know why Aaron Trang

25:15.644 --> 25:17.080
was borrowing theNew Dawn.

25:17.124 --> 25:18.734
He was collecting water
samples from the Gulf.

25:18.778 --> 25:20.301
He submitted
them to Navy ONR

25:20.344 --> 25:21.563
for testing.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.130
Location tags tie them

25:23.173 --> 25:24.131
to Vietnamese
fishing waters.

25:24.174 --> 25:25.175
He was trying to find

25:25.219 --> 25:26.699
evidence of
the contamination.

25:26.742 --> 25:29.005
That was the proof that someone
was poisoning the waters.

25:29.049 --> 25:30.572
Yeah, except he
didn't find any.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.182
The water samples were clean.

25:32.226 --> 25:35.229
Then how are the Vietnamese
losing so much of their hauls?

25:35.272 --> 25:38.798
Because they were being
sabotaged somewhere else.

25:38.841 --> 25:40.626
Why poison

25:40.669 --> 25:44.020
100 miles' worth
of open water

25:44.064 --> 25:47.937
when you can get the job done
in a single location?

25:47.981 --> 25:49.983
The processing plant.
Triton's offer was refused,

25:50.026 --> 25:52.202
so they're closing the deal
a different way.

25:52.246 --> 25:53.508
SEBASTIAN: If Aaron
traced the sabotage

25:53.552 --> 25:55.292
to the plant,
Wilkins could've eliminated him,

25:55.336 --> 25:56.642
framed his uncle
for the murder.

25:56.685 --> 25:58.644
Sebastian and I
will head to the plant.

25:58.687 --> 26:00.559
Look for evidence
that links back to Triton.

26:00.602 --> 26:02.996
I'll dig deeper
into Wilkins.

26:07.130 --> 26:09.045
LEILA: Bye, buddy.
Have a good day, okay?

26:09.089 --> 26:11.047
I will.I love you.

26:11.091 --> 26:13.093
I love you, too.

26:13.136 --> 26:15.051
Nice school.

26:15.095 --> 26:16.966
Most expensive one
in the parish.

26:17.010 --> 26:19.055
We've already danced
this dance, Agent Lasalle.

26:19.099 --> 26:20.622
I didn't steal any money.

26:20.666 --> 26:23.669
Tell me how a church bookkeeper
affords private school.

26:23.712 --> 26:25.148
My son is gifted.

26:25.192 --> 26:26.367
His academic achievements
awarded him a scholarship,

26:26.410 --> 26:27.934
which is something
that I'm very proud of.

26:27.977 --> 26:31.067
I may need to verify that
with the school administrator.

26:31.111 --> 26:32.286
You can do
whatever the hell you want.

26:32.329 --> 26:33.722
I am done defending myself

26:33.766 --> 26:35.158
for something that I didn't do.

26:35.202 --> 26:37.073
No, you're right.

26:37.117 --> 26:39.032
You're not the bad guy.

26:39.075 --> 26:41.121
I'm sorry.

26:41.164 --> 26:42.601
But my father was.

26:42.644 --> 26:43.863
What?

26:43.906 --> 26:45.908
Well, he stole everything
from the employees

26:45.952 --> 26:47.693
he said he loved like family.

26:47.736 --> 26:50.173
Only person he really loved
was himself.

26:50.217 --> 26:52.393
No. Beau wouldn't do that.

26:52.436 --> 26:54.438
Well, the evidence
suggests otherwise.

26:54.482 --> 26:56.484
I knew your father
as well as I knew anyone,

26:56.527 --> 26:59.922
and I have never met a finer man
in my life.

27:01.924 --> 27:04.884
Help me find the money.

27:04.927 --> 27:08.061
Prove me wrong about my father.

27:14.241 --> 27:16.591
My parents are mortified.

27:16.635 --> 27:19.855
If the contamination is really
happening in our own house,

27:19.899 --> 27:22.075
they blame themselves.No, tell them
it's not their fault.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.426
Do you know this man?

27:27.820 --> 27:29.909
We all know Wilkins.
When we refused

27:29.952 --> 27:32.302
to sell out to Triton,
he tried to intimidate us.

27:32.346 --> 27:34.043
And you stood your ground.My people are resilient,

27:34.087 --> 27:35.871
but I'm afraid

27:35.915 --> 27:37.786
without this plant
and the local fishermen,

27:37.830 --> 27:39.309
our community won't survive.

27:39.353 --> 27:41.790
Mr. Dao, what's security
like here? You have guards

27:41.834 --> 27:43.879
or surveillance cameras?

27:43.923 --> 27:45.315
We process shrimp,
not state secrets.

27:45.359 --> 27:47.100
Well, I'll do a sweep
for forensic evidence,

27:47.143 --> 27:49.058
but I'm assuming
the place is sanitized daily.

27:49.102 --> 27:50.581
Per regulation.

27:50.625 --> 27:52.148
Still our best bet, Sebastian.

27:52.192 --> 27:53.367
I'll go get my kit

27:53.410 --> 27:55.021
and then I'll contact
the Coast Guard.

27:55.064 --> 27:57.240
Maybe get their pollution
inspection team out here

27:57.284 --> 27:58.894
to help out.That's Dith Trang.

28:02.419 --> 28:04.595
I don't think that bat's
for playing baseball.

28:14.040 --> 28:15.519
Hey! What the hell
are you doing?

28:15.563 --> 28:16.695
That's my truck!

28:25.268 --> 28:28.358
NCIS! Everybody break it up!

28:28.402 --> 28:30.621
Break it up! Hey!

28:32.667 --> 28:34.974
Industrial acetone.

28:35.017 --> 28:36.758
This stuff works
as well as gasoline

28:36.802 --> 28:38.281
when you're starting a fire.

28:38.325 --> 28:39.935
Especially on a boat.

28:39.979 --> 28:41.502
WILKINS:
That's not mine.

28:53.949 --> 28:55.472
Chemical signature
of the acetone

28:55.516 --> 28:56.822
found in your truck

28:56.865 --> 28:58.649
matched what was used

28:58.693 --> 29:01.130
to torch Dith Trang's boat.GREGORIO:
And conveniently

29:01.174 --> 29:02.915
destroyed any evidence
on board that would point

29:02.958 --> 29:04.351
to his nephew's killer.

29:04.394 --> 29:07.006
I don't know how
that got in my truck.

29:07.049 --> 29:10.661
I didn't start any fires,
and I sure as hell

29:10.705 --> 29:13.969
didn't kill anyone.Just like you haven't
been sabotaging

29:14.013 --> 29:16.058
the Vietnamese fishermen.Like I told you,

29:16.102 --> 29:18.452
Triton's not involved
with any of this mess.

29:18.495 --> 29:20.062
Your company is not
in this room,

29:20.106 --> 29:22.021
Mr. Wilkins.
It's just you.

29:22.064 --> 29:23.892
At the end of the day,
they'll say you acted alone,

29:23.936 --> 29:25.676
hang you out to dry.

29:25.720 --> 29:28.157
Unless I give you
a bigger fish to fry.

29:28.201 --> 29:30.159
Is that what we're doing here?

29:30.203 --> 29:31.857
Tell us who ordered you

29:31.900 --> 29:35.164
to go after the Dao family
and silence Aaron Trang,

29:35.208 --> 29:37.558
we could probably make a deal.

29:37.601 --> 29:39.125
That sounds really good.

29:39.168 --> 29:42.911
Problem is,
I'm... not... involved.

29:42.955 --> 29:44.913
Somebody's settin' me up.

29:44.957 --> 29:46.959
Yeah, well,
the evidence says otherwise.

29:47.002 --> 29:49.048
Aside from the acetone,

29:49.091 --> 29:51.354
we got witness statements
here about your

29:51.398 --> 29:53.139
past harassment.

29:53.182 --> 29:54.401
Look, home office wasn't happy

29:54.444 --> 29:56.359
with the Daos' refusal to sell.

29:56.403 --> 29:58.187
Maybe we put
a little extra pressure.

29:58.231 --> 30:00.973
Contaminating shrimp
isn't extra pressure.

30:01.016 --> 30:02.539
It's sabotage.

30:02.583 --> 30:04.193
Corporate told me
to back off weeks ago.

30:04.237 --> 30:05.629
They're already negotiating
with another facility

30:05.673 --> 30:06.979
over on Grand Isle.

30:07.022 --> 30:10.112
One that won't
play games.

30:10.156 --> 30:11.853
What does that mean?

30:11.897 --> 30:15.117
Triton only tried
to buy the Daos' plant

30:15.161 --> 30:18.207
because we heard
they were courting offers.

30:18.251 --> 30:21.036
Next thing we know,
it's off the market.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.733
Heard from who?

30:22.777 --> 30:24.866
Word on the dock spreads as fast
as word on the street,

30:24.910 --> 30:26.128
especially
with gossip like this.

30:26.172 --> 30:28.000
It may not
look like much,

30:28.043 --> 30:30.829
but that processing plant's
worth a fortune.

30:36.791 --> 30:39.054
The Daos would never
sell their family plant.

30:39.098 --> 30:41.578
Mm-hmm. Question
is, who would?

30:44.103 --> 30:46.279
You sure
it's the same routing number?

30:46.322 --> 30:48.847
Yes, ma'am.

30:48.890 --> 30:50.631
Thank you for your time.

30:50.674 --> 30:52.415
What did he do
for the Andersons?

30:52.459 --> 30:54.678
Medical bills
for their boy's surgery,

30:54.722 --> 30:56.463
paid in full.

30:56.506 --> 31:00.249
Well, Charlie Anderson always
did made Beau laugh.

31:00.293 --> 31:03.513
PRIDE: So your father did
embezzle the money, but he's

31:03.557 --> 31:06.473
gifting it back to his employees
from beyond the grave?

31:06.516 --> 31:08.562
Mm, guilty as charged.

31:08.605 --> 31:10.651
All payments coming
from the Caymans.

31:10.694 --> 31:12.871
But any luck figuring out
who's sending the money?

31:12.914 --> 31:15.221
Every gift tracks back
to the same bank.

31:15.264 --> 31:18.180
Now, it'll take me some time
to crack their security,

31:18.224 --> 31:20.879
that is...
if you even want me to.

31:22.706 --> 31:25.231
Dad's still here, trying
to make this right.

31:25.274 --> 31:27.929
Told you he didn't keep
that money for himself.

31:27.973 --> 31:30.279
Just kept it from the IRS.PATTON :
Yeah.

31:30.323 --> 31:32.151
Well, noble as
all this is,

31:32.194 --> 31:34.805
the government's not gonna
give you a pass on those taxes.

31:34.849 --> 31:36.807
Well, some of this money--
we can get it back.

31:36.851 --> 31:38.287
The employees...

31:38.331 --> 31:41.160
They'll understand.

31:41.203 --> 31:43.205
Yeah,
they weren't just employees.

31:43.249 --> 31:45.425
They were family.

31:49.472 --> 31:51.474
This guy's a monster,
even towards his own family.

31:51.518 --> 31:53.259
After Eddie's parents
shot down Triton's offer,

31:53.302 --> 31:54.608
he went behind their backs

31:54.651 --> 31:56.262
and petitioned the court
for power of attorney.

31:56.305 --> 31:57.828
Yeah. Claims his
parents were unfit

31:57.872 --> 31:59.874
to run their own
processing plant.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.571
Court rejected the claim,
so it looks like

32:01.615 --> 32:03.660
he found a new angle
to force the sale.

32:03.704 --> 32:05.924
Well, points for
ambition, huh?Learned it in New York.

32:05.967 --> 32:09.318
Swam with the venture capital
sharks, but never found funding.

32:09.362 --> 32:11.103
And when his parents
got in the way,

32:11.146 --> 32:12.800
he started sabotaging
their livelihood.

32:12.843 --> 32:14.149
Aaron was trying
to stop him.

32:14.193 --> 32:16.238
Yeah. And we know
how that turned out.

32:16.282 --> 32:18.023
Mm

32:18.066 --> 32:20.025
It's all theory right now.

32:20.068 --> 32:22.462
Eddie's been really good
at covering his tracks.Mm-hmm.

32:22.505 --> 32:24.507
Dith Trang just called.
Amy's missing again.

32:24.551 --> 32:26.379
He thinks she's gonna make
another move against Triton.

32:26.422 --> 32:28.729
Amy has no idea
she's fighting the wrong enemy.

32:28.772 --> 32:31.123
Eddie's the one
ripping their community apart.

32:31.166 --> 32:32.385
And Triton's done
showing mercy.

32:32.428 --> 32:33.908
This could be really
dangerous for her.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.214
Okay. Stay on Eddie.
Our theory's sound,

32:35.257 --> 32:37.520
but we need some
real evidence.

32:37.564 --> 32:39.261
Where are you going?

32:39.305 --> 32:43.396
I'm gonna try the impossible and
convince a teenager she's wrong.

32:53.188 --> 32:56.017
HANNAH:
Whatever you think
you're doing,

32:56.061 --> 32:58.106
just don't.

32:58.150 --> 33:00.761
I have to be the one.

33:00.804 --> 33:03.198
It has to be me.

33:03.242 --> 33:05.374
For Aaron.

33:09.465 --> 33:11.641
I won't let you stop me
from killing Eddie.

33:23.566 --> 33:25.046
Amy,

33:25.090 --> 33:27.048
you're gonna give me the gun,
okay?

33:27.092 --> 33:28.702
No.

33:28.745 --> 33:30.269
Yeah, Amy.

33:30.312 --> 33:32.532
You're gonna lower the gun.

33:32.575 --> 33:34.925
You're gonna hand
it to me, okay?

33:36.449 --> 33:38.799
I'm gonna make sure
that you don't screw up

33:38.842 --> 33:41.715
the rest of your life, okay?

33:41.758 --> 33:43.760
It's non-negotiable.

33:47.112 --> 33:49.897
How did you know
it was Eddie?

33:49.940 --> 33:52.900
My dad told me that Aaron was
dumped from the New Dawn,

33:52.943 --> 33:55.685
and I did what you couldn't
and asked around the docks.

33:55.729 --> 33:58.210
'Cause word on the dock spreads

33:58.253 --> 34:00.777
as fast as it does
on the street, huh?

34:00.821 --> 34:04.390
Night Aaron died,
people saw him with Eddie.

34:06.087 --> 34:08.611
:
I just knew.

34:08.655 --> 34:12.006
They were best friends
when they were kids.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.574
Went out on our boat
all the time.

34:15.879 --> 34:17.881
Things changed.

34:17.925 --> 34:19.753
Because Aaron joined the Navy?No.

34:19.796 --> 34:21.972
Aaron never stopped being proud
of who we are,

34:22.016 --> 34:24.758
but Eddie hated
where we come from.

34:24.801 --> 34:26.760
He got out.

34:26.803 --> 34:29.154
Resented coming back.

34:29.197 --> 34:31.025
Aaron paid the price.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.984
If you're looking for justice
for your family...

34:34.028 --> 34:36.248
this is not the way.

34:36.291 --> 34:37.901
Then how?

34:37.945 --> 34:41.253
I'll show you, okay?

34:42.689 --> 34:44.082
If you trust me.

34:55.397 --> 34:57.443
AMY:
Eddie?

34:57.486 --> 34:59.227
Geez.

34:59.271 --> 35:02.448
Amy. You scared me.

35:02.491 --> 35:05.059
I thought I was all by myself.Sorry. Wasn't trying
to sneak up on you.

35:05.103 --> 35:07.975
Gregorio says that deputies are
holding a five-block perimeter,

35:08.018 --> 35:10.064
so if anything goes south,
they'll be ready.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.935
Yeah, I'm hoping it won't.

35:11.979 --> 35:13.676
Okay, then.
What are you doing here?

35:13.720 --> 35:17.811
I know that our waters
are not contaminated.

35:17.854 --> 35:20.509
Our shrimp are being poisoned
at this plant,

35:20.553 --> 35:23.077
and you're the one doing it.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.166
Where did you get that from?

35:25.210 --> 35:27.386
Aaron.

35:27.429 --> 35:29.605
He told me everything.

35:29.649 --> 35:31.825
And I know you were with him
the night that he died.

35:31.868 --> 35:34.001
She's poking the bear.It's all right.
Give her a minute.

35:34.044 --> 35:36.917
EDDIE: Have you told anyone
else about this?
No one.

35:36.960 --> 35:40.007
You're like family, Eddie.

35:40.050 --> 35:42.531
I needed to hear it
from you first.

35:45.230 --> 35:47.449
Tell me
what happened that night.

35:47.493 --> 35:49.886
I thought
he understood what was at stake,

35:49.930 --> 35:52.019
what I'm fighting
to protect.

35:52.062 --> 35:54.456
We're clinging to a way
of life that's dying,

35:54.500 --> 35:56.806
and if we don't adapt,
we cease to exist.

35:56.850 --> 35:58.808
That doesn't explain
why Aaron's dead.

35:58.852 --> 36:02.247
He confronted me
about the sabotage.

36:02.290 --> 36:04.205
I tried to convince him

36:04.249 --> 36:06.686
that change was best
for all of us.

36:06.729 --> 36:08.731
The money I'm going to make
from selling this plant

36:08.775 --> 36:10.080
can go back into the community.

36:10.124 --> 36:11.517
Still not telling me
what happened.

36:11.560 --> 36:12.996
He stood in the
way of progress,

36:13.040 --> 36:15.042
and I couldn't let that happen.

36:15.085 --> 36:17.087
He pushed me,
I pushed him back.

36:17.131 --> 36:18.915
He hit his head
on the side of the boat,

36:18.959 --> 36:20.656
fell over.

36:20.700 --> 36:22.615
But he was already dead
before he was on the boat.

36:22.658 --> 36:25.139
How did you know that?

36:25.183 --> 36:26.880
I...

36:26.923 --> 36:29.012
Damn it.
Got to get in there.

36:29.970 --> 36:32.407
You talked to the cops.

36:32.451 --> 36:35.584
Eddie... just...

36:35.628 --> 36:38.631
just give me a moment
to explain it to you.

36:42.069 --> 36:43.940
[Eddie yells,
Amy gasps]

36:47.379 --> 36:48.641
SEBASTIAN:
Eddie, let her go!

36:53.994 --> 36:56.301
You're okay.

36:56.344 --> 36:58.041
Come on. You okay?

36:58.085 --> 36:59.869
You're okay.

37:03.482 --> 37:06.006
[garbled radio transmission,
distant siren blaring]

37:21.848 --> 37:24.067
It's okay, Amy.

37:24.111 --> 37:25.852
May I?

37:29.290 --> 37:34.034
You're a very brave
young woman.

37:34.077 --> 37:37.124
Aaron would've done
the same for me.

37:37.167 --> 37:38.908
Then you honor
his legacy, Amy.

37:38.952 --> 37:43.217
You be the woman you know
he wanted you to be.

37:44.610 --> 37:47.395
You need any advice,
you call me.

37:49.484 --> 37:51.486
Okay?

37:54.707 --> 37:57.187
Thank you.
Thank you.

38:04.978 --> 38:07.676
Got to be honest with you,
Special Agent Lasalle.

38:07.720 --> 38:10.940
I'm really hoping
to hear some good news from you.

38:10.984 --> 38:12.942
Please...

38:12.986 --> 38:14.944
tell me you found the money.

38:14.988 --> 38:18.121
Well, the money my dad took--
it's gone for good.

38:18.165 --> 38:20.341
I am sorry to hear that.

38:20.385 --> 38:23.039
We were all hoping
for a different outcome.

38:23.083 --> 38:25.346
Does Lasalle Enterprises
have enough cash on hand

38:25.390 --> 38:27.130
to cover the first payment?

38:27.174 --> 38:29.132
No, ma'am, we do not.

38:29.176 --> 38:31.613
Then you're in a tough spot.

38:31.657 --> 38:34.050
Until the debt is cleared,
you'll have to hold on

38:34.094 --> 38:35.661
to his badge.

38:38.881 --> 38:41.710
Don't think
that'll be necessary.

38:45.975 --> 38:47.977
LEILA: Connor's gonna
miss this school.

38:48.021 --> 38:50.980
LASALLE: He's not
going anywhere.

38:51.024 --> 38:53.287
He belongs here.
He's staying.

38:53.331 --> 38:56.725
Tuition paid with
ill-gotten gains...

38:56.769 --> 38:58.423
I can't.

38:58.466 --> 39:00.120
It's not ill anymore.

39:00.163 --> 39:02.862
I'm squarin' it
with the IRS.

39:02.905 --> 39:05.430
You're shutting down
the company, aren't you?

39:05.473 --> 39:10.478
We liquidate, may just
break even with the government.

39:10.522 --> 39:13.089
But those assets
are your inheritance.

39:13.133 --> 39:15.657
They never belonged to me.

39:15.701 --> 39:19.269
They belonged to my father's
family. All of you.

39:19.313 --> 39:22.142
Hmm.

39:22.185 --> 39:25.841
You know, he talked
about you all the time.

39:25.885 --> 39:27.626
Bragged to anybody
who would listen

39:27.669 --> 39:32.021
about his boy who was
out there saving the world.

39:32.065 --> 39:33.893
I know you two
had your issues,

39:33.936 --> 39:36.722
but he was so
proud of you.

39:42.162 --> 39:44.033
Thank you, Miss Addison.

39:46.514 --> 39:48.908
Chris?

39:48.951 --> 39:51.301
I don't really have
a lot friends

39:51.345 --> 39:53.260
here anymore.

39:53.303 --> 39:56.306
Would you like to join Connor
and me for supper tonight?

39:58.700 --> 40:00.920
Ah, thanks for the invite,
but I couldn't.

40:00.963 --> 40:02.574
Well, now,
wait a minute.

40:02.617 --> 40:04.489
You don't even know
what I'm cookin' yet.

40:04.532 --> 40:08.014
Barbecue brisket,
fresh pecan pie.

40:10.103 --> 40:13.019
Now, only a crazy person would
turn down an offer like that.
