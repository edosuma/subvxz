32:08.793 --> 32:10.852
You're my grandmother. aren't you?

32:11.029 --> 32:13.726
We are related.
but not in the way that you think.

32:13.898 --> 32:15.957
We're the same person.

32:17.402 --> 32:19.370
You mean. I'm you reincarnated?

32:19.537 --> 32:20.561
Mm.

32:20.738 --> 32:23.901
The idea of reincarnation
comes frorn a natural sense...

32:24.075 --> 32:29.343
...that there is more to this world
than we can taste or touch.

32:29.514 --> 32:32.176
Unfortunately, it misses the main point.

32:32.350 --> 32:34.785
- Which is...?
- Time.

32:35.320 --> 32:38.119
You think of time
as if it were a straight line...

32:38.289 --> 32:40.883
...like a load or a train track...

32:41.059 --> 32:43.221
...with the past at one end
and the future at the other.

32:43.394 --> 32:47.024
The metaphor is seductive.
but it's highly misleading.

32:47.532 --> 32:50.832
The world was flat
until we discovered it was round.

32:57.141 --> 32:59.906
You must break
your old paradigm of time, Sara.

33:00.712 --> 33:03.704
Both past and future
are contained in the eternal present.

33:07.385 --> 33:10.047
It's a better example than you realize.

33:11.122 --> 33:13.682
Think of a reel of motion picture film.

33:13.858 --> 33:16.623
Each frame is a lifetime.

33:16.794 --> 33:19.092
But all of them exist at once.

33:19.263 --> 33:21.755
If you run it through the projector
of human consciousness...

33:21.933 --> 33:24.402
- You create continuity.
- No. my deal.

33:24.569 --> 33:27.834
The illusion oi continuity.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.703
But if you think of the reel
wound just so...

33:30.875 --> 33:33.936
...some of the frames
touch other frames.

33:34.979 --> 33:38.381
From one flame through another.
any flame can be leached...

33:38.549 --> 33:40.677

I am not from your past, Sara,
nor are you from my future.

34:20.525 --> 34:23.755
Both of our lifetimes exist right now.

Oh. Sara. we have died a thousand times
and are born a thousand and one.

and tell you, “Yes, you are dead“...
