Would you...! They're very sore,

00:47.172 --> 00:49.174
so you hitting them does not help.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.174
That's fucking crazy.

00:49.216 --> 00:52.093
Good morning, fruit cups. How was your night?

00:49.216 --> 00:52.093
It fucking sucked.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.888
Yeah, how was yours? Probably

food today,

01:04.356 --> 01:06.149
I'm going the fuck home.

01:06.191 --> 01:08.027
You're not going fucking home. You're

A three-second atomic hover wedgie?

01:40.141 --> 01:42.061
That's not even fucking possible.

01:42.101 --> 01:44.980
Fuck, yeah, it is. I had fucking Cory off the

01:46.899 --> 01:48.817
He couldn't beat off or shit for a week.

01:48.859 --> 01:51.152

02:04.416 --> 02:05.876

02:05.918 --> 02:09.088
This word is "acquire a boat."

02:05.918 --> 02:09.088
Which means what?

02:09.129 --> 02:12.299
That's a candy-coated fucking way of saying

02:09.129 --> 02:12.299
"steal a boat".

02:12.340 --> 02:14.718

02:12.340 --> 02:14.718

02:14.760 --> 02:17.096
Yes, that's exactly what they're

02:14.760 --> 02:17.096

Well, maybe that wouldn't be that bad.

02:23.602 --> 02:25.562

02:34.154 --> 02:36.573
schedules the food the same as at home,

03:09.523 --> 03:10.732

03:10.774 --> 03:12.484
Little Steven's on the show too.

He's, like, the main guy

03:13.861 --> 03:15.362
and he plays for Bruce Springsteen.

03:15.403 --> 03:16.655
So he would know him.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.906
We could pretend we know him.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.658
All right, boys, have a great day.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.619

03:34.006 --> 03:35.340
We're going to do this easy one,

03:35.382 --> 03:37.009
then I'm going to get some food.

03:37.051 --> 03:38.259
Then we'll do it. It shouldn't be

03:37.051 --> 03:38.259
that hard.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.845
I mean, most trolls don't get to be

03:39.887 --> 03:41.180
more than about three feet.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.597
They still scare the fuck out of me.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.349
Are you guys fucking kidding me?

03:44.391 --> 03:46.393
It's going to be a guy dressed up in a costume.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.062
Trolls don't exist. Maybe.

03:48.103 --> 03:49.771
What do you mean maybe? How do you know?

03:49.813 --> 03:51.690
There's theories that they exist.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.525
Theories... You've been all

03:58.530 --> 04:00.532

04:00.574 --> 04:03.869
samsquanches exist, huh?

04:03.911 --> 04:06.038
Oh, are you telling me those aren't real

04:03.911 --> 04:06.038
now too, are you?

04:06.080 --> 04:09.332
No, we're not even going to fucking get

04:06.080 --> 04:09.332
into this right now.

04:09.374 --> 04:12.711
I don't believe in wizards and magic and any of that...

04:12.753 --> 04:14.922
paranormal horseshit,

04:14.963 --> 04:17.716
but who's to say there's not little

04:14.963 --> 04:17.716
cocksuckers like that

04:17.758 --> 04:20.385
that live under the bridge and come

04:17.758 --> 04:20.385
out and cause shit?

04:20.427 --> 04:22.096
And as far as samsquanches go,

04:22.137 --> 04:24.139
don't even get me fucking started!

04:28.309 --> 04:29.770
Julian: There's the

04:28.309 --> 04:29.770
troll, boys.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.813
Just, is it or is it just

04:29.811 --> 04:31.813
a homeless guy?

04:31.855 --> 04:34.566
It's a guy dressed up in a troll costume!

04:34.608 --> 04:36.568
Does that count? That does count!

04:36.610 --> 04:38.319
You take a picture, him and I will do it.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.780
Three seconds.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.782
Okay, on my count.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.992
Hi, could we get a picture?

04:41.823 --> 04:43.992
Picture?

04:45.869 --> 04:47.079
Ready? Yeah, yeah.

04:47.121 --> 04:48.413
Okay, boys, are you ready?

04:47.121 --> 04:48.413
Yep.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.207
Okay. One, two, there, go!

04:50.249 --> 04:51.458
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

04:51.499 --> 04:53.252
Stop! (Indistinct)

04:53.293 --> 04:54.544
Get away! Get away!

04:54.586 --> 04:55.921
Wait, guys, you got...

04:55.963 --> 04:57.756
What the fuck were you doing?

04:57.798 --> 05:01.342
Ricky: What are you doing? We're not trying

04:57.798 --> 05:01.342
to rob you!

05:01.384 --> 05:03.178
50 bucks... Are you fucking

05:01.384 --> 05:03.178
kidding?

05:03.220 --> 05:05.264
Let's go! Ho-ho!

05:05.305 --> 05:07.557
Did we just rob a fucking troll?

05:11.895 --> 05:14.397
Ricky: A "fettet fisk".

05:14.439 --> 05:16.441
Don't know what that means. Probably

05:14.439 --> 05:16.441
means the big fish...

05:16.483 --> 05:18.944
fucked the... fish with the wings.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.822
Ricky... Ricky, why would

05:18.986 --> 05:21.822
it mean that?

05:21.863 --> 05:23.531
No one would call a restaurant that.

05:23.573 --> 05:27.410
"Big Fish Fucked the Little Fish with

05:23.573 --> 05:27.410
the Wings" Restaurant.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.830
It's something different. It might be for a fancy

05:27.452 --> 05:29.830
place. I don't know.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.372
I just want to order, boys.

05:31.414 --> 05:33.625
They've got to have burgers here, boys.

05:31.414 --> 05:33.625
Jesus!

05:33.667 --> 05:36.503
They don't got to have burgers.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.503
Well, it's a fucking pub!

05:36.544 --> 05:38.463
It is, but it's a Norway pub.

05:38.505 --> 05:41.008
Maybe they don't even fucking know what burgers are over here.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.551
This is fucked! There's an "a" with

05:41.049 --> 05:43.551
something over it,

05:43.593 --> 05:45.428
an "o" with a line fucking through it.

05:45.470 --> 05:49.183
"hj"... how do you pronounce...

05:45.470 --> 05:49.183
Heujeu? Hajeu?

05:49.224 --> 05:51.518
This actually sounds pretty nice:

05:51.559 --> 05:53.270
a "Dagens Husman".

05:53.312 --> 05:55.438
Ricky: This has bacon in it.

05:53.312 --> 05:55.438
I do see bacon.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.608
No, but it's got a "k", so it might mean it's

05:55.480 --> 05:58.608
baked in the oven.

05:58.650 --> 06:01.820
Fuck! Know what I mean?

05:58.650 --> 06:01.820
It's very confusing.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.780
A Dagens Husman does sound...

06:01.862 --> 06:03.780
"Yag-hurt"?

06:03.822 --> 06:05.782
Is that like yogurt? "Yag-hurt"?

06:05.824 --> 06:07.993
Could be. But it might not be.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.953
It could be something totally fucking

06:08.035 --> 06:09.953
different, man.

06:09.995 --> 06:15.209
Wait a second. What's a "sommersalat...

06:09.995 --> 06:15.209
med donair"?

06:15.250 --> 06:17.002
They definitely don't have donairs here.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.921
It wouldn't be a donair on top of a sommersalat.

06:19.963 --> 06:21.422
That sounds like a summer salad

06:21.464 --> 06:22.841
with a big donair plunked on it.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.383
A sausage or something.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.383
Hei.

06:24.425 --> 06:27.179
Hey. Hey.

06:24.425 --> 06:27.179
(Speaking in Norwegian)

06:27.221 --> 06:29.472
W-what? Errr...

06:29.514 --> 06:32.100
have you decided for food?

06:29.514 --> 06:32.100
Well, no.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.061
We haven't because we don't know what any

06:32.142 --> 06:34.061
of this fucking shit means!

06:34.102 --> 06:36.146
How the fuck do you people understand

06:34.102 --> 06:36.146
each other?

06:36.188 --> 06:38.232
Like, look at... You have an "o"

06:36.188 --> 06:38.232
with a line through it!

06:38.273 --> 06:40.275
Yeah, but, Ricky, when they're talking

06:38.273 --> 06:40.275
to each other,

06:40.317 --> 06:43.444
they're all talking the same language. They understand each

06:40.317 --> 06:43.444
other.

06:43.486 --> 06:46.698
Look, I can basically communicate in other

06:43.486 --> 06:46.698
languages.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.407
Do you have a...

06:48.449 --> 06:51.703
a burger... round, squishy?

06:51.745 --> 06:53.247
Cheeseburger? Yes...

06:53.288 --> 06:54.789
Cheeseburger? All right,

06:54.831 --> 06:56.457
we'll take three cheeseburgers

06:54.831 --> 06:56.457
then, please.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.626
No, wait. Make sure there's no fucking

06:56.499 --> 06:58.626
octopus in it.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.128
It needs to be a... Yes.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.256
A... how would you say, beef...

07:02.297 --> 07:03.506
Ricky: A fucking cow.

07:03.548 --> 07:04.925
Uh, white-black fur

07:04.966 --> 07:06.593
and uh...

07:06.634 --> 07:07.928
uh...

07:07.969 --> 07:10.055
(Lowing)

07:10.097 --> 07:11.556
Cow. Beef. No, Ricky,

07:11.598 --> 07:13.808
that's a moose burger you just ordered.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.019
A cow, like, mooooo!

07:16.061 --> 07:17.478
Moooo!

07:17.520 --> 07:19.731
Milk it, you know... Beef, beef. Beef?

07:19.773 --> 07:21.316
Yes. Okay, we'll take it.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.609
Um, another round, please.

07:22.650 --> 07:23.860
Ricky: Fucking right,

07:22.650 --> 07:23.860
Julian.

07:23.902 --> 07:25.445
And can we start up a tab? Tab?

07:25.486 --> 07:27.697
Waitress: Money.

07:25.486 --> 07:27.697
Money? Credit card.

07:27.739 --> 07:30.284
I got it, I got it. He's got it.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.119
Cash money. Pay the lady, Julian.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.536
Julian: Just keep them coming.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.247
We keep drinking, you keep them coming.

07:35.289 --> 07:38.166
Okay? (In Norwegian)

07:38.208 --> 07:41.295
Okay, do you think that we learn how

07:38.208 --> 07:41.295
to speak "Norweguian"

07:41.336 --> 07:43.130
in the last 10 seconds there, you fucking dummy?

07:43.171 --> 07:45.715
No, we did not! Ricky, don't be rude to her.

07:45.757 --> 07:47.301
Well, she probably can't hear what I'm

07:45.757 --> 07:47.301
fucking saying.

07:47.342 --> 07:48.551
She doesn't speak English.

07:48.593 --> 07:54.099
(In Norwegian, slowly)

07:48.593 --> 07:54.099
Mm-hmm.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.017
200 for a fucking triple?

07:56.059 --> 07:57.269
Whoa, 200 what? 200...?

07:57.311 --> 07:58.812
200 dollars?

07:58.853 --> 08:00.314
Oh, just wait now.

08:00.355 --> 08:02.441
Julian: You kidding me!

08:00.355 --> 08:02.441
(Shouting in Norwegian)

08:02.482 --> 08:05.568
No! Jesus, don't call the politiet!

08:02.482 --> 08:05.568
(In Norwegian)

08:05.610 --> 08:07.446
Call the fucking potti!  I'm finishing my beer!

08:07.487 --> 08:09.156
(In Norwegian) I don't give...

08:09.197 --> 08:10.907
Call the fucking police because, guess what everybody,

08:10.949 --> 08:13.285
the Norwegian police can suck my fucking cock!

08:13.327 --> 08:15.495
Waitress: ...Politiet!

08:15.536 --> 08:17.914
(Tearfully) Boys, we're going to jail

08:15.536 --> 08:17.914
in a foreign country.

08:17.956 --> 08:20.125
Like, why aren't you guys freaking out right now?

08:20.167 --> 08:21.876
Because we're going to get to eat, Bubs.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.004
That's kind of exciting. We might

08:21.918 --> 08:24.004
find some good drugs.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.214
(Whispering) Ricky, would you

08:24.045 --> 08:26.214
be quiet?

08:26.256 --> 08:27.715
Oh, my God.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.134
We might never get out!

08:29.176 --> 08:30.510
I don't even care any more.

08:30.551 --> 08:31.928
Tom: Goddamn, son of a bitch!

08:33.263 --> 08:35.182
Excuse me, sir. Officer:

08:33.263 --> 08:35.182
Hello.

08:35.223 --> 08:37.600
You got three Canadian boneheads in there?

08:37.642 --> 08:40.479
Man: We got three Canadians

08:37.642 --> 08:40.479
inside, that's correct.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.105
How much to get them out?

08:42.147 --> 08:44.024
The fine is 3,000 Norwegian kroner.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.442
3,000?

08:46.526 --> 08:47.694
Thank you.

08:50.822 --> 08:52.573
Let's go, shit stains.

08:52.615 --> 08:53.992
Can you just pick me up tomorrow?

08:54.034 --> 08:55.410
Tom: You're going now.

08:55.452 --> 08:56.661
Bubbles: Julian, what are you

08:55.452 --> 08:56.661
talking about?

08:56.703 --> 08:57.996
I'm fucking starving!

08:58.038 --> 08:59.373
You're not staying here tonight.

08:59.414 --> 09:00.915
The food's probably good in here.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.459
Bubbles: It probably is but

09:00.957 --> 09:02.459
you're not staying.

09:02.501 --> 09:04.085
Thanks, guys. Really good

09:02.501 --> 09:04.085
police work.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.837
Fucking supercops over here.

09:07.297 --> 09:09.341
(Handcuffs jingling)

09:09.383 --> 09:11.759
Thank you. Thank you.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.722
Well, you boys really fucked that one up.

09:15.763 --> 09:18.266
Now you owe Swearnet 3,000 kroners.

09:18.308 --> 09:20.018
You got any idea how much money that is?

09:20.060 --> 09:21.936
No! No.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.936
That's why we ended up in jail,

09:21.978 --> 09:24.272
because the currency keeps fucking

09:21.978 --> 09:24.272
changing on us.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.066
It's almost 500 Canadian.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.026
That's not bad. Oh, for fuck's sakes!

09:28.068 --> 09:29.610
I suggest you either go acquire a boat

09:29.652 --> 09:31.405
or get over to Fridtjov's.

09:31.446 --> 09:33.532
We're not "acquiring" a fucking boat,

09:31.446 --> 09:33.532
I'll tell you...

09:33.573 --> 09:35.783
Ricky, you're not acquiring a boat,

09:35.825 --> 09:37.077
I'll tell you that. It's easy.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.328
Well, then, Fridtjov's it is.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.080
Why is going to meet Fridtjov...

09:40.121 --> 09:41.998
why is that the big thousand-dollar task?

09:42.040 --> 09:43.583
Something doesn't fucking make sense.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.919
I don't write the task, Swearnet does,

09:45.960 --> 09:47.546
and they said to give him these.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.214
Give a man flowers?

09:49.256 --> 09:50.882
Norwegian tradition.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.885
I'm not giving a dude flowers.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.512
I'll fucking give the flowers. No big deal.

09:55.554 --> 09:57.097
It's not like I want to bang him.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.473
Where are we going, Bubs?

09:58.515 --> 10:00.808
Here, I got the address right here.

10:06.565 --> 10:08.275
It's this place here, boys.

10:08.316 --> 10:09.692
I'm fucking excited to meet him

10:09.734 --> 10:12.070
because I love "Lilyhammer".

10:12.112 --> 10:14.114
It's just something seems fucking

10:12.112 --> 10:14.114
weird to me,

10:14.155 --> 10:15.449
that's all I'm saying.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.449
You know what?

10:15.490 --> 10:16.950
I bet they just feel bad for us.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.368
I mean, you just had the shit

10:16.991 --> 10:18.368
kicked out of you,

10:18.410 --> 10:19.744
you haven't been eating right,

10:19.786 --> 10:20.995
getting enough liquor or fucking dope.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.330
They don't feel bad for us.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.165
They just want to fuck with us, man.

10:24.207 --> 10:26.293
Or they want us to have a better time.

10:24.207 --> 10:26.293
No, they don't, man!

10:26.334 --> 10:29.504
This just seems too easy. It's too good to be true.

10:26.334 --> 10:29.504
I agree, man.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.631
So just be on your guard is all I'm saying.

10:31.672 --> 10:33.674
Should I knock?

10:33.716 --> 10:36.094
It's "fridge-tov". Fridge Top?

10:38.012 --> 10:40.056
All right, let me do the talking.

10:42.601 --> 10:44.936
(In Norwegian)

10:44.978 --> 10:46.854
Hi. Uh...

10:46.896 --> 10:49.524
We're looking for Fridge Top.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.359
Fridtjov? That's me, yes.

10:51.401 --> 10:55.113
Yeah, hi. Nice to meet you. Big fan.

10:51.401 --> 10:55.113
Yeah, nice to meet you.

10:55.155 --> 10:58.366
We're really good friends with

10:55.155 --> 10:58.366
Steven Van Damme. He...

10:58.408 --> 11:01.119
Van... Uh, Van Zandt.

10:58.408 --> 11:01.119
Steven Van Zandt.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.662
Ah, Steven, yeah, you know Steven?

11:02.703 --> 11:04.080
Yeah, yeah, he's a really good

11:02.703 --> 11:04.080
friend of ours

11:04.122 --> 11:05.665
and he said that maybe we could come by.

11:05.706 --> 11:07.542
And we brought you some flowers.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.961
I guess that's a Norwegian tradition.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.130
No, it's... it's not.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.591
Oh. Uh, anyway, he thought maybe

11:12.172 --> 11:14.591
you'd want to come

11:14.633 --> 11:16.343
for drinks with us at the Icebar.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.844
We're from Canada, and he thought maybe

11:17.885 --> 11:20.555
you'd show us a good time.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.849
That I should come to have drinks

11:20.597 --> 11:22.849
with you guys?

11:22.890 --> 11:24.725
That's just what he was saying. I mean...

11:24.767 --> 11:25.977
If you're cool with that.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.228
He said you might be into it

11:27.270 --> 11:29.439
and just to come by and say hi.

11:29.481 --> 11:30.940
Well, why don't you come in.

11:30.982 --> 11:33.151
We could have a couple of drinks

11:30.982 --> 11:33.151
here first.

11:33.193 --> 11:36.404
I have a bottle of nice red,

11:33.193 --> 11:36.404
so we could...

11:36.446 --> 11:39.240
get to know each other a bit better maybe.

11:39.282 --> 11:40.992
Okay, yeah.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.286
I guess it wouldn't hurt.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.286
So she's him?

11:43.328 --> 11:45.622
(Whispering) It's him. I don't

11:43.328 --> 11:45.622
know what's going on.

11:45.664 --> 11:47.706
See, I told you this was...

11:45.664 --> 11:47.706
Something's up!

11:52.170 --> 11:54.130
(Whispering) Let's just guzzle these fucking

11:52.170 --> 11:54.130
drinks down

11:54.172 --> 11:56.424
and get the fuck to the bar...

11:54.172 --> 11:56.424
Well, we can't be rude, Julian.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.510
He invited us into his house.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.510
We've just go to go fast.

11:58.552 --> 12:00.928
We can have a nice drink here and then

11:58.552 --> 12:00.928
get him to the bar.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.223
It's still the easiest thousand

12:00.970 --> 12:03.223
bucks we ever made.

12:03.264 --> 12:05.183
Have some...

12:05.225 --> 12:06.893
nice red wine.

12:06.934 --> 12:08.353
Ricky: Nice.

12:06.934 --> 12:08.353
Oh, excellent.

12:11.481 --> 12:15.151
Just help yourself, guys.

12:11.481 --> 12:15.151
Thank you.

12:15.193 --> 12:17.278
Cheers. Cheers.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.738
Bubbles: Ah, cheers!

12:17.320 --> 12:19.738
(Glasses clinking)

12:19.780 --> 12:21.575
Bubbles: Cheers. Nice

12:19.780 --> 12:21.575
to meet you.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.034
Yeah, this was a nice surprise.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.786
I was bored to death, so...

12:25.828 --> 12:26.996
Okay, good.

12:28.831 --> 12:32.126
So how do you know Steven?

12:32.168 --> 12:33.712
Ah, well, someone in the family

12:33.752 --> 12:35.463
used to cut most of their hair.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.549
And actually...

12:37.591 --> 12:39.634
he invited us to a couple of the Bruce Springfield

12:37.591 --> 12:39.634
concerts

12:39.676 --> 12:42.095
and we went out and had some

12:39.676 --> 12:42.095
dinners and...

12:42.136 --> 12:43.930
drinks... Springsteen.

12:42.136 --> 12:43.930
Springsteen.

12:43.971 --> 12:45.973
Springs... Springfieldsteen.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.225
(Chuckling) Springsteen.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.767
Springsteen. Springsteen.

12:48.809 --> 12:50.228
Yeah. Good guy, though.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.688
Yeah, he is. He's a nice guy.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.856
He slept over at our house

12:51.730 --> 12:53.856
a couple of times

12:53.898 --> 12:56.610
and played cards. Yeah...

12:56.651 --> 12:59.446
Yeah. I think my dad was in the army with

12:56.651 --> 12:59.446
him or something too.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.322
Sorry?

13:01.364 --> 13:04.743
Good wine. Yeah, it is. Yeah.

13:04.783 --> 13:06.578
Yeah. (Sigh)

13:06.620 --> 13:09.289
Yeah, so you want to go to the Icebar?

13:06.620 --> 13:09.289
Yeah.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.708
Icebar, yeah. We should get there

13:09.330 --> 13:11.708
pretty soon, actually.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.460
Is it a good spot? Yeah, it's nice.

13:13.501 --> 13:16.003
You know, the bar is, uh... real ice.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.339
Okay, cool. Decent.

13:18.381 --> 13:19.716
Yeah we haven't... Should check that out.

13:19.758 --> 13:20.967
Shh.

13:21.008 --> 13:23.010
Robert? Robert:

13:21.008 --> 13:23.010
(Indistinct)

13:23.052 --> 13:24.387
Just stay calm, okay?

13:24.429 --> 13:25.846
For sure. Calm?

13:25.888 --> 13:28.308
(Conversation in Norwegian)

13:29.392 --> 13:30.602
Hi. Hi.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.228
(Conversation continues)

13:33.938 --> 13:36.399
(Lips smacking)

13:36.441 --> 13:37.858
(Moaning)

13:37.900 --> 13:39.778
(Kissing continues)

13:39.818 --> 13:40.987
Yep.

13:42.656 --> 13:46.117
(In Norwegian)

13:46.159 --> 13:47.952
They know Steven. Man:

13:46.159 --> 13:47.952
Okay.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.288
Julian.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.914
Good to meet you. American?

13:51.956 --> 13:53.166
No, no, we're from Canada.

13:53.207 --> 13:54.417
Canada, ah, okay.

13:54.459 --> 13:55.834
Ricky. Nice to meet you.

13:55.876 --> 13:57.170
Nice to meet you. Bubbles. Nice

13:55.876 --> 13:57.170
to meet you.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.421
Nice to meet you. I'm a big fan.

13:58.463 --> 14:00.256
Okay, thank you. (Chuckling)

14:00.298 --> 14:02.841
Right, yeah. So...

14:02.883 --> 14:05.679
So what's the occasion? Is celebrate...

14:05.720 --> 14:08.682
No, no. No occasion. They just came to

14:05.720 --> 14:08.682
visit, to say hello

14:08.723 --> 14:12.268
because they're friends of Steven and...

14:08.723 --> 14:12.268
Ah...

14:12.310 --> 14:13.520
Yeap. Yes.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.438
Fridtjov: We are friends

14:13.561 --> 14:15.438
of Steven...

14:15.480 --> 14:17.440
My father's brother's mother used to cut

14:15.480 --> 14:17.440
his hair

14:17.482 --> 14:18.692
and most of the family...

14:18.733 --> 14:20.610
His father?

14:20.652 --> 14:22.153
Yeah... Yeah?

14:22.195 --> 14:23.404
Yeah, his...

14:23.446 --> 14:25.281
Yeah, he gets that mixed up sometimes.

14:25.323 --> 14:27.492
And... Yeah, we've done all kinds

14:25.323 --> 14:27.492
of stuff together.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.704
We used to go for long drives. Beaches...

14:30.745 --> 14:34.081
But, you know, it's not something

14:30.745 --> 14:34.081
special. Okay?

14:34.123 --> 14:36.083
Un huh... It's...

14:34.123 --> 14:36.083
it's just...

14:36.125 --> 14:37.335
It's just...

14:37.377 --> 14:39.504
Yes, so just calm down, okay?

14:39.546 --> 14:41.506
Uh... (Puffing)

14:41.548 --> 14:43.883
(In Norwegian)

14:43.924 --> 14:46.302
Some wine for me, or...?

14:43.924 --> 14:46.302
Yeah...

14:46.344 --> 14:49.055
We're just getting ready to go to the

14:46.344 --> 14:49.055
bar, the Icebar.

14:49.096 --> 14:51.057
Okay. Icebar? Yeah.

14:51.098 --> 14:52.809
Yeah, do you want to come with us?

14:52.851 --> 14:54.728
We're just going to go down

14:52.851 --> 14:54.728
for some drinks

14:54.769 --> 14:56.521
and see what happens after that.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.521
Julian: That'd be cool.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.022
Fridtjov: (Calling to Robert)

14:56.563 --> 14:58.022
Find a bit of smoke...

14:58.064 --> 14:59.273
Ah... Fridtjov:

14:58.064 --> 14:59.273
Robert.

14:59.315 --> 15:00.525
(In Norwegian)

15:00.567 --> 15:01.735
Fridtjov: (In Norwegian)

15:03.152 --> 15:04.904
(In Norwegian)

15:04.945 --> 15:06.740
Oh, yeah...

15:06.781 --> 15:09.325
I brought some flowers for her...

15:06.781 --> 15:09.325
for him.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.745
I just thought it was a Norwegian

15:09.367 --> 15:11.745
tradition.

15:11.786 --> 15:14.330
And Steve thought that would be

15:11.786 --> 15:14.330
a good idea.

15:14.372 --> 15:15.915
Okay... Yeah.

15:15.956 --> 15:19.126
(In Norwegian)

15:19.168 --> 15:22.922
It's just polite when you are

15:19.168 --> 15:22.922
visiting someone.

15:22.963 --> 15:25.759
You give flowers...

15:25.800 --> 15:28.344
or chocolate or something.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.344
Uh...

15:28.386 --> 15:31.097
It's not like we've been fucking or anything.

15:31.138 --> 15:32.348
Whoa-ho! (Chuckling)

15:32.390 --> 15:34.100
No, it's just flowers. No...No?

15:34.141 --> 15:35.351
No. We're...

15:35.393 --> 15:37.353
You've not been fucking around, no?

15:37.395 --> 15:40.314
(In Norwegian)

15:43.150 --> 15:45.361
Flowers... you are... sweetheart, yeah?

15:45.403 --> 15:46.780
Oh, no, don't get the wrong idea.

15:46.821 --> 15:48.197
We just... I was just being nice.

15:48.239 --> 15:50.199
I just thought it was a tradition.

15:50.241 --> 15:52.577
We normally... Yeah, we wouldn't

15:50.241 --> 15:52.577
bring flowers normally.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.579
We were told that's what you do.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.414
We're just going to go out for some drinks.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.874
Julian: Yeah, we should get going.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.584
You can come with us. It's nothing...

15:59.626 --> 16:01.586
nothing bad happening here at all.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.547
Both: (Speaking in Norwegian)

16:10.219 --> 16:13.139
(In raised voice in Norwegian)

16:17.017 --> 16:18.603
(In Norwegian)

16:18.645 --> 16:20.480
I'm not some kind of fucking...

16:20.521 --> 16:22.982
nymphomaniac! No, no, no, no,

16:20.521 --> 16:22.982
no, no, no!

16:23.023 --> 16:25.192
Look, we're not trying to cause anything here.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.403
Just... guys, just calm down here.

16:27.445 --> 16:30.364
(In Norwegian)

16:32.867 --> 16:35.411
No fucking bar! No!

16:35.453 --> 16:38.372
(In Norwegian)

16:40.249 --> 16:41.459
Ricky: Hey, guys!

16:40.249 --> 16:41.459
Guys, come on!

16:41.501 --> 16:43.419
Guys, guys, guys. Bubbles:

16:41.501 --> 16:43.419
Guys!

16:43.461 --> 16:45.421
Julian: Hey, hey!

16:45.463 --> 16:47.006
Will you calm down here!

16:47.047 --> 16:48.257
(Struggling)

16:48.299 --> 16:50.635
Holy fuck, calm down, guys!

16:50.677 --> 16:52.428
What's going on, boys? I don't know.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.430
See, I told you there was something up.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.432
Robert: (Shouting in Norwegian)

16:56.474 --> 16:58.768
(Enraged shouting)

16:58.810 --> 17:00.394
Is everything okay out there?

16:58.810 --> 17:00.394
(Screams)

17:00.436 --> 17:01.813
(Glass breaking) Fridtjov:

17:00.436 --> 17:01.813
(Yelling in pain)

17:01.855 --> 17:03.105
Are you guys okay?

17:03.147 --> 17:04.858
Bubbles: Holy fuck,

17:03.147 --> 17:04.858
boys! Okay!

17:04.899 --> 17:07.234
Leave the fucking house now! Julian:

17:04.899 --> 17:07.234
Okay.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.236
Ricky: Did you want to come

17:07.276 --> 17:09.236
for some drinks, or...?

17:09.278 --> 17:11.865
Drink? Fuck you! Bubbles:

17:09.278 --> 17:11.865
Go, Ricky, just go!

17:11.906 --> 17:13.115
Get out of my house!

17:13.157 --> 17:15.618
Bubbles: Boys, run! Run!

17:17.495 --> 17:19.038
What are you doing here?

17:19.079 --> 17:22.416
Get out! Get the fuck out of my house!

17:24.502 --> 17:26.880
Boys, come on! Come on!

17:26.921 --> 17:28.464
Are they okay in there?

17:30.090 --> 17:32.051
What the fuck just happened?

17:30.090 --> 17:32.051
I don't know.

17:32.092 --> 17:33.887
Boys, let's just go. Come on, let's...

17:33.928 --> 17:36.055
Take your fucking flowers!

17:36.096 --> 17:37.891
Let's just go. Okay.

17:37.932 --> 17:40.267
Get out of my property!

17:37.932 --> 17:40.267
Ricky: Jesus Christ!

17:40.309 --> 17:43.270
Fuck... you motherfuck! (Thud of kick landing)

17:43.312 --> 17:45.690
I knew something was fishy as soon as Mayhue said

17:45.732 --> 17:47.859
bring flowers to the guy. We're supposed to just go in

17:47.901 --> 17:49.485
and ask the fellow out for drinks?

17:49.527 --> 17:51.278
The next think you know, knives are getting pulled

17:51.320 --> 17:53.280
and all fucking hell breaks loose.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.282
What in the flying fuck just fucking happened?

17:55.324 --> 17:57.284
Those guys are fucking crazy.

17:57.326 --> 17:58.912
See, I knew it was a goddamn setup.

17:58.953 --> 18:00.705
Didn't I say that? Too good to be true.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.082
We're trapped in hell here, boys.

18:03.123 --> 18:04.834
(Puffing) I just want to

18:03.123 --> 18:04.834
go the fuck home.

18:04.876 --> 18:06.085
Well, you want to eat,

18:06.126 --> 18:07.712
I need to get something to smoke...

18:07.754 --> 18:09.714
The only thing left to do is to fucking

18:07.754 --> 18:09.714
borrow a boat

18:09.756 --> 18:10.965
and go see an eff-jord,

18:11.007 --> 18:12.383
make some fucking money that way.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.801
It's fjord,  first of all,

18:13.843 --> 18:15.511
and we're not stealing a fucking boat.

18:15.553 --> 18:17.346
Mark my words. We're not doing it.

18:17.388 --> 18:18.932
What are we doing then?

18:18.973 --> 18:21.684
Well, we got the coupon for the Icebar.

18:21.726 --> 18:23.102
Why don't we go see with that?

18:23.143 --> 18:25.521
Maybe that gets us a drink or something.

18:25.563 --> 18:27.523
A drink would fill us up a little bit.

18:27.565 --> 18:29.943
Boys, you know what? I'm so fucking

18:27.565 --> 18:29.943
hungry right now,

18:29.984 --> 18:31.903
I don't think I can even have a drink.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.320
Just hang on for a sec.

18:33.362 --> 18:34.948
What? I'm fucked, man!

18:34.989 --> 18:36.741
I've got no more fucking fuel

18:34.989 --> 18:36.741
left in me.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.158
I'm... I'm fucked.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.536
Did you just say you can't drink?

18:40.578 --> 18:41.913
I don't think I can, man.

18:43.330 --> 18:44.749
My God...

18:44.791 --> 18:46.125
It's like my stomach's caving in,

18:46.166 --> 18:47.752
I'm losing weight, I'm not good.

18:47.794 --> 18:48.962
I'm not fucking good, boys.

18:50.588 --> 18:53.132
Okay, let's just go to the Icebar

18:50.588 --> 18:53.132
and re-group.

18:53.173 --> 18:55.551
Well, they better fucking serve more

18:53.173 --> 18:55.551
than just ice

18:55.593 --> 18:58.345
'cause I'm not eating fucking ice all night.

18:55.593 --> 18:58.345
(Sigh)

18:58.387 --> 19:00.139
Ricky, you don't go there to eat ice.

19:00.180 --> 19:02.141
The bar is made of ice.

19:02.182 --> 19:04.769
(Sigh) What?

19:04.811 --> 19:06.562
Ricky: So, what is it,

19:04.811 --> 19:06.562
like, a skating rink?

19:06.604 --> 19:08.982
Like, why the fuck do we need

19:06.604 --> 19:08.982
coats and gloves?

19:09.023 --> 19:10.650
'Cause the bar's made of ice, Ricky.

19:10.691 --> 19:13.152
I keep telling you that.

19:10.691 --> 19:13.152
It's an ice bar.

19:13.193 --> 19:15.780
What do you mean? It's made out of

19:13.193 --> 19:15.780
fucking ice, Ricky.

19:15.822 --> 19:18.365
The whole bar is made out of ice.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.159
So they found a fucking bar

19:18.407 --> 19:20.159
made out of ice

19:20.200 --> 19:21.786
and they just threw it in here?

19:21.828 --> 19:23.370
No... No...

19:23.412 --> 19:25.164
They shaped it into a bar

19:25.205 --> 19:27.166
but it's all... Just come in!

19:27.207 --> 19:28.793
Trying to explain to Ricky

19:28.835 --> 19:30.586
what a fucking ice bar is,

19:30.628 --> 19:32.588
it's like trying to explain calculus math

19:32.630 --> 19:35.008
to a fucking orangutan!

19:35.049 --> 19:37.176
Bubbles: He said just push

19:35.049 --> 19:37.176
this and in we go.

19:37.217 --> 19:38.803
Look at that. It's like Star Wars.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.554
That's cool. That's pretty cool.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.222
Bubbles: (Chuckle)

19:40.596 --> 19:42.222
There's another one.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.600
Bubbles: These are not the droids

19:42.264 --> 19:44.600
you're looking for.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.602
(Chuckling) Nice TV, uh?

19:46.644 --> 19:48.813
Bubbles: Oh, boys! Check it out!

19:48.855 --> 19:50.815
Julian: Holy shit!

19:50.857 --> 19:53.192
Decent! See, Ricky? This is what we're

19:50.857 --> 19:53.192
saying.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.610
Fuck, is this ever cool!

19:54.652 --> 19:56.821
Julian: This is fucking

19:54.652 --> 19:56.821
amazing, boys.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.614
Look at that! It looks fucking real too.

19:58.656 --> 20:00.616
Like, that looks like real fucking ice.

20:00.658 --> 20:02.409
Ricky, it is real ice.

20:00.658 --> 20:02.409
Feels like it too.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.037
It's real ice. This is ice.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.037
Ricky, this is ice!

20:04.078 --> 20:05.454
No, no, I get it,

20:05.496 --> 20:07.623
but it looks like fucking real ice.

20:07.665 --> 20:09.416
You know what I mean? Rick, it is ice!

20:09.458 --> 20:10.835
All of this is ice. Ricky, see this?

20:10.877 --> 20:12.086
Guess how they made this.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.754
Frozen water. This is ice.

20:13.796 --> 20:15.840
How did they get the dude in there?

20:15.882 --> 20:17.842
Bubbles: That's, like, a mould.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.842
Let's go get a drink, boys.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.301
Fuck! Jesus, Ricky.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.846
I don't get why you don't get it.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.263
Hey, how you doing?

20:23.305 --> 20:25.058
Uh, how many drinks do we get with that?

20:25.099 --> 20:26.851
Umm... actually, with this one,

20:26.893 --> 20:28.644
it's unlimited drinks.

20:28.686 --> 20:30.437
Unlimited? Pardon me?

20:28.686 --> 20:30.437
Bartender: Yeah...

20:30.479 --> 20:31.856
Unlimited? (Mixed chuckling)

20:31.898 --> 20:33.649
Okay, boys, that's a game-changer.

20:33.691 --> 20:35.275
All right, uh, rum and Cokes.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.653
Just keep them coming, all right?

20:35.317 --> 20:37.653
Doubles. Triples.

20:37.695 --> 20:39.488
Triple rum and Cokes.

20:37.695 --> 20:39.488
Yeah, you know, whatever you want.

20:39.530 --> 20:40.865
Oh, are these free?

20:40.907 --> 20:42.116
Bartender: Yeah, this

20:40.907 --> 20:42.116
is free too.

20:42.158 --> 20:43.868
Oh, my God, boys...

20:43.910 --> 20:45.661
unlimited nuts, unlimited drinks.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.246
Is this ice? This is ice here?

20:47.287 --> 20:48.873
Yeah, everything is made of ice.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.249
Wow... Just grab a drink.

20:50.290 --> 20:52.251
Grab a drink, boys. What are these?

20:52.292 --> 20:54.461
This is berry liquor with white wine.

20:54.503 --> 20:56.214
Perfect. So we can start

20:54.503 --> 20:56.214
with this.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.590
Thank you. No, no, no.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.466
Just the rum and Coke, okay?

20:57.631 --> 20:59.466
Okay.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.094
I will be right over here.

21:01.135 --> 21:03.262
Holy shit, boys! This is cool.

21:03.303 --> 21:05.681
All right, this is a game-fucking-changer,

21:03.303 --> 21:05.681
right here.

21:05.723 --> 21:07.474
Fucking right, it is! You know what?

21:07.516 --> 21:09.685
We just eat all these and she'll

21:07.516 --> 21:09.685
refill them...

21:09.727 --> 21:11.687
She'll just keep them coming, man.

21:09.727 --> 21:11.687
I'll fucking eat nuts.

21:11.729 --> 21:13.689
Wish I had... fucking weed

21:11.729 --> 21:13.689
and hash, boys...

21:13.731 --> 21:15.274
Rick, we'll get some after we get drunk, okay?

21:15.315 --> 21:17.276
I just want to make a toast to you guys.

21:17.317 --> 21:20.279
This is the first being drunk this

21:17.317 --> 21:20.279
entire fucking trip.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.281
I couldn't be with two better guys.

21:22.322 --> 21:24.491
I love you guys. Cheers.

21:22.322 --> 21:24.491
Good night, boys.

21:24.533 --> 21:28.121
(Enraged shouting) Where is the fucking

21:24.533 --> 21:28.121

21:28.162 --> 21:30.915
Ah, there you are, you motherfucker!

21:30.957 --> 21:32.917
Hey. Who was fucking

21:30.957 --> 21:32.917
my wife?

21:32.959 --> 21:34.293
Was it you? Huh? What?

21:34.334 --> 21:36.295
(Mixed chatter) I'm talking to you!

21:36.336 --> 21:39.298
Was it you? Giving my wife flowers!

21:39.339 --> 21:41.134
Jesus! Are you fucking kidding me?

21:41.175 --> 21:42.718
Do you want to try it? Julian!

21:42.760 --> 21:46.139
(Mixed shouting)

21:46.180 --> 21:48.307
Hey, hey, hey, hey! You want to fucking

21:46.180 --> 21:48.307
touch him?

21:48.348 --> 21:50.143
Yeah! Do you want

21:48.348 --> 21:50.143
to fucking...? Yeah!

21:50.184 --> 21:52.686
(Mixed shouting) Let him go!

21:54.354 --> 21:55.940
Motherfucker!

21:55.982 --> 21:57.733
He'll pull a fucking knife again.

21:57.775 --> 21:59.902
Please can you get out?

21:57.775 --> 21:59.902
What?

21:59.944 --> 22:01.320
Get out! We didn't do anything!

22:01.361 --> 22:02.822
We were minding our own business!

22:02.863 --> 22:04.949
He came in and hit our friend!

22:02.863 --> 22:04.949
Get out right now!

22:04.991 --> 22:06.533
Rick, Rick, Rick. Okay, just...

22:06.575 --> 22:08.535
(Groaning in pain) Fuck, man.

22:08.577 --> 22:09.954
What happened? Bartender:

22:08.577 --> 22:09.954
Out!

22:09.996 --> 22:11.205
Bubbles: Okay, we're going.

22:11.247 --> 22:12.456
He just got knocked out!

22:12.498 --> 22:14.167
Come on, come on.

22:14.208 --> 22:15.709
Come on, Ricky, get up.

22:15.751 --> 22:18.171
This wasn't our fault, by the way.

22:15.751 --> 22:18.171
Out.

22:18.212 --> 22:21.340
That crazy son-of-a-whore from Lilyhammer came back.

22:21.381 --> 22:23.176
(Groaning)

22:23.217 --> 22:25.178
Come here. Are you all right?

22:25.219 --> 22:27.721
Oh, my God, I think he broke my fucking jaw!

22:29.347 --> 22:31.184
For fuck's sakes!

22:31.225 --> 22:33.769
Bubbles: Here, Ricky, let's go

22:31.225 --> 22:33.769
get some ice on it.

22:33.811 --> 22:36.563
Holy fuck, that "Norweguian" sucker puncher

22:33.811 --> 22:36.563
fucking hits hard!

22:36.605 --> 22:37.982
Look at me, Ricky, look at me.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.357
It looks like it's fucking bent.

22:39.399 --> 22:40.776
Did he break it?

22:40.818 --> 22:42.195
I think it's okay, but it fucking hurts!

22:42.236 --> 22:43.654
Look at me straight on.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.363
I wish he was here right now. You

22:45.405 --> 22:46.615
Ricky!

22:46.657 --> 22:48.366
Just calm down.

22:48.408 --> 22:49.785
Boys, I'm done.

22:49.827 --> 22:52.997
What do you mean? I can't do this, man.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.332
Can't do what? What are you doing?

22:54.372 --> 22:55.749
Get up. I can't go on, man.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.168
I'm fucking...

22:57.210 --> 22:58.376
I'm fucked!

22:59.545 --> 23:00.713
So you're giving up?

23:02.048 --> 23:04.217
Just go on without me, man.

23:04.258 --> 23:06.593
Well, this isn't the fucking "Bridge

23:04.258 --> 23:06.593
Over The River Kwai".

23:06.635 --> 23:08.386
We're not going on without you. Come on!

23:08.428 --> 23:10.014
He fucking needs food, man.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.808
Julian, you're like the team leader.

23:12.850 --> 23:14.810
You're like Captain Kirk.

23:12.850 --> 23:14.810
Pffft!

23:14.852 --> 23:17.813
We can't go on without Captain Kirk.

23:17.855 --> 23:19.815
Come on. I'm Spock. That's Scotty.

23:19.857 --> 23:21.608
You're Kirk, team leader. Let's go.

23:21.650 --> 23:23.027
Why the fuck am I fucking Scott?

23:23.069 --> 23:24.820
I'm always that English prick.

23:24.862 --> 23:26.404
You're good at small engine repair

23:26.446 --> 23:28.824
and I'm logical.

23:28.866 --> 23:31.244
Come on, Julian. Just go on

23:28.866 --> 23:31.244
without me, man.

23:31.285 --> 23:32.828
I'm not fucking going anywhere!

23:32.870 --> 23:34.747
I'm not letting you give up.

23:34.788 --> 23:37.250
You're just not thinking straight

23:34.788 --> 23:37.250
'cause you're hungry.

23:37.291 --> 23:38.500
Just leave me here, man.

23:38.542 --> 23:39.919
Come on! You're not just like...

23:39.960 --> 23:42.255
you're not just like Kirk, you're...

23:42.296 --> 23:44.631
you're like our big brother.

23:44.673 --> 23:47.051
We need you... leading the way.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.053
Otherwise we get fucked up.

23:49.095 --> 23:51.638

23:51.680 --> 23:54.975
Oh, fuck. Big brothers don't let

23:51.680 --> 23:54.975
little brothers down.

23:55.017 --> 23:56.269
You know, I could do it,

23:56.310 --> 23:59.646
but you are probably better at it, I guess.

23:59.688 --> 24:02.275
Come on, who's got your belly?

24:02.316 --> 24:04.277
Come on, man, we'll get you some food.

24:11.325 --> 24:13.077

I don't know if I can do this,

Beam me up, buddy.

24:17.497 --> 24:20.084
Come on. (Groan)

24:20.126 --> 24:21.794
Boys, let's go to the park,

24:21.835 --> 24:23.296
find that troll,

24:23.337 --> 24:25.089
grab that little cocksucker's underwear

24:25.131 --> 24:26.673

I've got nothing left in the tank.
