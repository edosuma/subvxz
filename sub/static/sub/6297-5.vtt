<i>Previously on</i>
<i>The Borgias...</i>

00:02.089 --> 00:03.990
Giovanni Sforza.

00:04.058 --> 00:06.793
And my cousin,
Catherina Sforza.

00:06.861 --> 00:08.825
You would have a taste
of vengeance.

00:08.893 --> 00:10.697
Giovanni Sforza-
he proved ungallant?

00:10.765 --> 00:12.450
He betrayed our father,
the pope.

00:12.551 --> 00:13.796
If he misused you,

00:13.863 --> 00:15.332
he shall pay a
different kind of price.

00:15.400 --> 00:17.934
You think the blood of the
Borgia pope could cure us?

00:18.001 --> 00:20.034
We could bathe in it
together, Majesty.

00:20.102 --> 00:21.908
<i>Catherina Sforza</i>
<i>rides with the French.</i>

00:21.976 --> 00:23.212
She has the arms she needed

00:23.280 --> 00:25.214
and has retired to
her castle at Forli.

00:25.315 --> 00:26.515
And we forgive her?

00:26.584 --> 00:28.455
Priorities can change,
Cardinal Borgia.

00:28.522 --> 00:31.728
<i>The French have laid</i>
<i>waste to the papal states.</i>

00:31.795 --> 00:35.031
Our proposal is that
the armies combine-

00:35.099 --> 00:37.132
<i>to rid us of this</i>
<i>French plague.</i>

00:37.200 --> 00:39.335
You think we can
defeat the French?

00:39.403 --> 00:40.801
We can strike them at night.

00:40.869 --> 00:42.937
<i>They move like smoke</i>
<i>in the darkness.</i>

00:45.940 --> 00:47.841
<i>Do you have anything to</i>
<i>confess about this past night?</i>

00:47.908 --> 00:51.311
My night was as satisfactory
as I'm sure was yours.

00:52.413 --> 00:54.580
<i>I would beg your</i>
<i>permission to investigate</i>

00:54.648 --> 00:56.785
the office of public
works even further.

00:56.853 --> 00:58.521
Found more irregularities?

00:58.588 --> 01:01.057
There are so many in
this Vatican of yours.

01:01.125 --> 01:03.360
<i>You are?</i>
<i>Nicolo Machiavelli.</i>

01:03.427 --> 01:05.295
Ambassador to
the House of Medici.

01:05.363 --> 01:07.532
The Medici family are
bankers to the world.

01:07.633 --> 01:08.966
To the Vatican itself.

01:09.034 --> 01:11.736
<i>Father Savonarola</i>
<i>calls it usury.</i>

01:11.803 --> 01:15.640
This pope is a
lecherous abomination!

01:15.708 --> 01:18.411
Florence, you will
pay for your greed-

01:18.479 --> 01:21.983
when he drags
you to perdition!

01:22.051 --> 01:24.519
Savonarola prophesied
the end of days-

01:24.621 --> 01:26.256
not the murder of the pope.

01:26.324 --> 01:29.359
If I had his approval,
would I have yours?

It is ingenious,

03:47.311 --> 03:49.646
St. Peter's?
The Church.

03:49.714 --> 03:53.684
Like an enormous
bank machine.

03:53.752 --> 03:57.955
The faithful pay to maintain
it in its magnificent splendor.

03:58.056 --> 04:01.593
This theatre of redemption.

04:01.661 --> 04:03.094
The greater the display,

04:03.162 --> 04:06.231
the more they gather from
all corners of Christendom.

04:06.299 --> 04:08.734
The more they pay.

04:08.802 --> 04:13.005
Can the College of Cardinals
be made to see the light?

04:13.073 --> 04:15.141
They each have their secrets.

04:15.208 --> 04:16.875
If we can find them.

04:18.879 --> 04:21.279
The French munitions
were destroyed

04:21.348 --> 04:23.482
by some brave Roman souls.

04:23.550 --> 04:25.918
Were you one of them?

04:25.986 --> 04:30.122
I dress in red satin,
Father, not in armour.

04:30.223 --> 04:34.326
So you are a
cardinal still, hmm?

04:34.428 --> 04:38.297
Though sometimes in disguise.

04:38.365 --> 04:41.701
Dare we say it, like us.

04:42.603 --> 04:44.637
So, now we got
rid of one enemy,

04:44.705 --> 04:46.772
it's now time to
deal with another.

04:46.840 --> 04:48.374
Friar Savonarola?

04:48.442 --> 04:50.876
Your cousin,
Catherina Sforza!

04:50.944 --> 04:52.645
Oh, so it continues.

04:52.712 --> 04:55.247
She has retired to
her castle in Forli

04:55.348 --> 04:57.449
with an abundance
of French cannon.

04:57.517 --> 05:00.052
Well, then I can defend her
no longer, Your Holiness.

05:00.153 --> 05:03.489
We would have her come to Rome

05:03.557 --> 05:05.959
and kneel at our feet

05:06.027 --> 05:10.831
and have those beauteous lips
kiss the papal ring.

05:10.898 --> 05:12.532
Let me be the
messenger, Father.

05:12.633 --> 05:13.700
<i>You?</i>

05:13.768 --> 05:15.769
You care so little
for your hide?

05:15.836 --> 05:18.504
I care more for
my father's well-being.

05:18.605 --> 05:19.939
Oh.

05:20.006 --> 05:22.174
So while we make the
acquaintance of Florence,

05:22.242 --> 05:25.810
Cardinal Borgia will
journey to Forli.

05:25.878 --> 05:31.081
And you tell that lady that
if she does not obey us,

05:31.149 --> 05:33.650
we will reduce her
fortress to dust

05:33.718 --> 05:36.887
and drag her in chains
through the streets of Rome.

05:36.988 --> 05:39.356
The choice is hers!

05:39.457 --> 05:40.891
To Florence -

05:40.959 --> 05:43.060
<i>and its heretic,</i>
<i>Savonarola!</i>

05:55.939 --> 05:58.808
Do you know anyone in Forli?

06:03.381 --> 06:05.182
I know everyone in Forli,
Your Eminence.

06:05.283 --> 06:07.451
How?

06:07.519 --> 06:09.620
I was born there.

06:12.891 --> 06:16.360
I can't imagine you being born,
Micheletto.

06:16.428 --> 06:18.796
Or dying, for that matter.

06:18.864 --> 06:21.599
But you must show us
your ancestral home.

06:33.479 --> 06:35.746
<i>I preach against Rome,</i>

06:37.649 --> 06:42.653
<i>I preach against the</i>
<i>sale of indulgences!</i>

06:44.822 --> 06:49.693
<i>I preach against</i>
<i>the display and pomp</i>

06:49.760 --> 06:52.629
<i>of the lords of the Church!</i>

06:52.697 --> 06:57.467
<i>Of their gold and jewellery!</i>

06:57.534 --> 07:02.572
And who pays, who pays
for such decadence?

07:02.673 --> 07:04.007
You!

07:04.074 --> 07:06.075
<i>The faithful.</i>

07:06.143 --> 07:09.545
<i>Where does your</i>
<i>charity end up?</i>

07:09.613 --> 07:12.182
In the Medici bank,
in Florence...

07:14.586 --> 07:23.094
...where it multiplies like
maggots through usury.

07:23.195 --> 07:24.796
So the root of-

07:24.863 --> 07:26.464
You should leave,
Holy Father.

07:26.565 --> 07:29.201
No, we would hear more.

07:29.302 --> 07:30.936
The friar is eloquent.

07:31.037 --> 07:32.939
And dangerous.

07:33.006 --> 07:34.240
<i>If we are discovered,</i>

07:34.308 --> 07:36.642
<i>they will tear you</i>
<i>limb from limb.</i>

07:36.709 --> 07:39.311
<i>Know your enemy, Cardinal.</i>

07:39.379 --> 07:42.548
Know him better
than your friend.

07:42.615 --> 07:46.085
<i>...with the sword</i>
<i>of righteousness!</i>

07:48.621 --> 07:51.490
<i>Did Adam need gold coin?</i>

07:51.558 --> 07:54.459
<i>Did Eve need</i>
<i>diamond and pearl?</i>

07:54.527 --> 07:57.195
<i>We must drive the</i>
<i>Medici bank from Florence</i>

07:57.263 --> 08:00.231
<i>or burn it to the ground.</i>

08:00.299 --> 08:02.266
Pray with me.

08:02.334 --> 08:06.670
Ave Maria, gratia plena,
Dominus tecum.

08:06.737 --> 08:08.938
<i>Benedicta tu in mulieribus,</i>

08:09.006 --> 08:13.642
<i>et benedictus fructus</i>
<i>ventris tui, Iesus.</i>

08:13.710 --> 08:16.145
Fuck the bloody Pope in Rome,

08:16.246 --> 08:18.214
my bambino has come home.

08:18.315 --> 08:19.782
Mama no.

08:19.850 --> 08:21.417
The Pope of Rome
can wipe his ass.

08:21.485 --> 08:23.786
I've got my baby back
at last.

08:23.854 --> 08:26.222
She can go on like this
for hours, Your Eminence.

08:26.290 --> 08:28.892
Eminence?

08:28.960 --> 08:30.394
Is he eminent?

08:30.462 --> 08:33.030
In my own small world.

08:33.097 --> 08:35.066
He is your dottore,
is he not?

08:35.167 --> 08:36.232
His dottore?

08:36.333 --> 08:37.501
If you are my son's dottore,

08:37.568 --> 08:40.871
I must surely bring
out my best wine.

08:40.972 --> 08:42.874
You have a name, dottore?

08:42.975 --> 08:46.044
Cesare.

08:46.145 --> 08:48.780
And you have read many books?

08:48.848 --> 08:50.048
Books?

08:50.149 --> 08:51.683
What kind of dottore
are you?

08:51.751 --> 08:54.853
My son studies medicine,
he has to read the books.

08:54.920 --> 08:58.756
His dottore helps
him read the books.

08:58.824 --> 09:00.225
Ah.

09:00.292 --> 09:03.061
But it takes so long,
this student business.

09:03.128 --> 09:05.629
Indeed.
It takes forever.

09:05.697 --> 09:09.299
He has to learn to
wield the scalpel.

09:09.367 --> 09:10.767
The knife.

09:10.835 --> 09:12.335
To cut up the cadaver?

09:12.403 --> 09:14.405
To find out where
the spleen resides.

09:14.472 --> 09:16.807
The liver.
The heart.

09:16.875 --> 09:18.342
He is a good student?

09:18.444 --> 09:20.078
The best.

09:20.146 --> 09:22.147
And he has but one ambition.

09:22.215 --> 09:23.849
Ambition?

09:25.285 --> 09:27.987
To look after his mama
when she's old.

09:28.088 --> 09:29.789
He told you that?

09:29.890 --> 09:31.257
He tells me daily.

09:31.325 --> 09:33.360
When he wields the scalpel.

09:33.461 --> 09:35.963
What does he say?

09:36.031 --> 09:37.364
For Mama!

09:37.432 --> 09:39.700
No!
This one's for Mama!

09:39.768 --> 09:42.637
The next one's for Mama.
It's always for Mama.

09:42.738 --> 09:45.273
Ah, my boy.

09:45.374 --> 09:49.178
My sweet,
dear blessed boy.

09:50.780 --> 09:53.982
Look at those hands, dottore.

09:54.050 --> 09:56.351
The hands of a healer, no?

09:56.419 --> 09:58.186
A maestro.

09:58.254 --> 10:01.689
My dottore maestro.

10:01.757 --> 10:02.958
Augustino!

10:03.025 --> 10:04.625
He's back, Augustino.

10:04.726 --> 10:08.696
Our Micheletto has returned.

10:08.764 --> 10:10.898
Augustino's getting married.

10:10.965 --> 10:13.066
You remember Violetta,
from the baker's shop?

10:13.134 --> 10:14.801
Yes.
With the...

10:14.902 --> 10:16.136
Lazy eye.

10:16.204 --> 10:17.738
Augustino's not looking
at the lazy eye.

10:17.805 --> 10:19.806
No.
Her hips, more like it.

10:19.874 --> 10:21.007
Big hips, yes?

10:21.075 --> 10:22.576
Big childbearing hips.

10:22.643 --> 10:24.544
And on that happy note,
fair lady,

10:24.612 --> 10:26.246
I must leave you.

10:26.314 --> 10:28.082
You won't stay the night?

10:28.149 --> 10:31.085
I have business in Forli.

10:31.153 --> 10:34.088
Dottore business.

10:34.189 --> 10:37.725
Yes, as have you.

10:40.196 --> 10:41.996
Mama...

10:47.637 --> 10:49.805
We must go heal the sick...
yes?

10:49.873 --> 10:52.275
But before you leave,
you come back?

10:52.343 --> 10:55.011
For your Mama's bean stew?

10:55.079 --> 10:56.279
<i>He would not miss it, Mama.</i>

10:56.380 --> 10:58.647
Not for the world.

11:08.457 --> 11:11.759
So, dottore,
shall we heal the sick?

11:11.827 --> 11:13.661
You must forgive my mother
her fantasies, Your Eminence.

11:13.728 --> 11:17.198
Has she many more of them?

11:17.266 --> 11:20.167
She believes her husband died
reaping corn in a field.

11:20.235 --> 11:22.302
Your father?
And he didn't?

11:22.370 --> 11:25.972
No, I killed him.

11:26.040 --> 11:28.575
Was there a reason?
Many.

11:32.412 --> 11:35.047
Friar.

11:35.148 --> 11:38.383
Are you the cleric in red?

11:38.451 --> 11:40.552
I find the robes of your order

11:40.620 --> 11:44.656
suit me better at
this pitiful juncture.

11:44.757 --> 11:47.492
Have you taken our vows?

11:47.560 --> 11:49.860
I can no longer serve
the Pope of Rome.

11:49.928 --> 11:54.932
Ah, yes, I heard of your plans
for his deposition.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.770
Your plans failed miserably.

11:58.838 --> 12:00.405
Indeed.

12:00.506 --> 12:02.574
I must confess to failure.

12:02.641 --> 12:04.743
Oh, so have you come here
to make

12:04.811 --> 12:07.046
a confession
of your failure?

12:07.147 --> 12:08.314
No.

12:08.382 --> 12:09.883
I am here
to propose

12:09.950 --> 12:13.320
a solution to the sickness
in our Holy Mother Church.

12:13.421 --> 12:16.857
A solution?

12:16.958 --> 12:20.193
We must remove him.

12:20.261 --> 12:21.395
From the chair
of St. Peter's?

12:21.462 --> 12:23.363
From the chair
of St. Peter's.

12:23.431 --> 12:25.132
But you tried
that already.

12:25.199 --> 12:26.966
From the chair
of St. Peter's...

12:27.034 --> 12:29.035
...and from this world.

12:31.238 --> 12:34.407
I shared a vision
with you once.

12:34.475 --> 12:37.777
Of the bloated figure
of the Borgia pope,

12:37.845 --> 12:43.050
lying blackened with sickness
on the floor of St. Peter's.

12:43.151 --> 12:45.786
No one dared approach it.

12:45.854 --> 12:50.492
Are you saying you're the one
to bring this to pass?

12:50.559 --> 12:53.228
Only if I have your
blessing, Friar.

12:53.296 --> 12:55.297
And the blessing
of your order.

12:55.364 --> 12:57.498
You have the
blessing of the Lord.

12:57.566 --> 13:00.501
For he shall bring it to pass.

13:00.569 --> 13:03.404
And if my vision
was a true one,

13:03.472 --> 13:05.606
you will have my blessing.

13:05.674 --> 13:10.611
And the blessing of
the Lord Himself.

13:10.679 --> 13:13.614
Be the sword of
the apocalypse,

13:13.681 --> 13:16.616
the sword of righteousness.

13:16.684 --> 13:22.356
Ride out like death,
on a pale horse.

14:02.365 --> 14:03.532
Your Holiness.

14:03.633 --> 14:05.501
Signore Machiavelli.

14:05.569 --> 14:07.770
Had we been graced with
<i>news of your arrival,</i>

14:07.838 --> 14:09.872
<i>we could have done</i>
<i>justice to your presence.</i>

14:09.940 --> 14:13.577
We cannot always travel
in public splendor.

14:13.644 --> 14:18.114
A pope must learn the problems
of his subjects.

14:18.182 --> 14:21.750
And your humble subject,
Piero de Medici awaits.

14:21.851 --> 14:23.619
Oh, good.

14:41.670 --> 14:44.171
Cannon.
French cannon.

14:44.239 --> 14:46.007
Too many of them.

14:48.844 --> 14:50.077
Would we be safer

14:50.145 --> 14:52.246
in your mother's humble abode,
Micheletto?

14:52.314 --> 14:55.550
You will always be safe,
whenever I am near, Eminence.

14:55.651 --> 14:58.554
This Sforza family
are not to be trusted.

15:01.592 --> 15:04.093
Stay close and keep
the horses saddled.

15:06.531 --> 15:10.268
My son, Benito,
longs for a soldier's career.

15:10.336 --> 15:13.004
Hm.
It has much to recommend it.

15:13.072 --> 15:14.873
You bear arms yourself,
Signore Borgia?

15:14.941 --> 15:17.910
No, my love, he wears
a cardinal's skirt.

15:17.978 --> 15:19.311
But your dress is that of-

15:19.379 --> 15:21.481
I am a civilian today.
An ambassador.

15:21.549 --> 15:24.217
He comes bearing a
message from his father,

15:24.284 --> 15:25.685
the Pope of Rome.

15:25.752 --> 15:28.188
Have I guessed
correctly, Cardinal?

15:28.255 --> 15:30.223
You think so little
of your charms?

15:30.291 --> 15:32.826
You've come to
sample them, perhaps?

15:32.894 --> 15:34.161
Perhaps.

15:34.229 --> 15:37.231
While bearing a message
from the Pope of Rome.

15:37.299 --> 15:39.500
The pope does send
his best regards.

15:39.568 --> 15:41.769
And would request your
beauteous presence

15:41.836 --> 15:43.537
at the chair
of St. Peter's.

15:43.605 --> 15:46.373
He would sample
my charms also?

15:46.441 --> 15:48.442
Perhaps.

15:48.510 --> 15:51.779
He would feel your lips
on his papal ring.

15:55.517 --> 15:57.851
He would have me
kneel to him?

15:57.919 --> 15:59.620
Bow?

15:59.688 --> 16:02.356
The whole world must
bow to the Holy Father.

16:02.424 --> 16:05.225
Whom does your mother
bow to, my son?

16:05.293 --> 16:06.960
Nobody.

16:07.028 --> 16:08.595
You heard him, Cardinal?

16:08.663 --> 16:10.597
His mother bows to nobody.

16:10.665 --> 16:13.767
And if nobody were
to sit at her table?

16:13.835 --> 16:15.268
She would not bow.

16:15.336 --> 16:18.771
But there are other
forms of obeisance.

16:20.207 --> 16:22.775
Are there, Mother?
Indeed, my son.

16:22.843 --> 16:27.612
There is a form of surrender
which implies no submission.

16:27.680 --> 16:30.115
It gave birth to you.

16:30.183 --> 16:31.750
I confess I am lost,
Mother.

16:33.319 --> 16:36.654
Indeed, you are truly
a soldier made of hard wood.

16:36.722 --> 16:41.526
But the cardinal must know
I only kneel when it suits me.

16:41.627 --> 16:44.596
As must the Holy Father.

16:47.600 --> 16:48.900
If you do not come
willingly, my lady-

16:49.001 --> 16:51.903
Oh hush, Cardinal, hush.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.871
You are our guest
this fine evening.

16:53.939 --> 16:56.240
I'd have no
discord between us.

16:56.308 --> 16:58.343
You can relay
the Holy Father's message

16:58.444 --> 17:00.444
in its fullness tomorrow.

17:08.619 --> 17:10.954
We live in a fortress now,

17:11.022 --> 17:16.894
barricaded against a sea of
zealots in the streets outside.

17:16.994 --> 17:18.529
Zealots?

17:18.597 --> 17:23.400
Their fervour for the friar's
visions increases daily.

17:23.468 --> 17:25.403
They would ban
all art and ornament

17:25.470 --> 17:26.837
and they have
set their sights

17:26.905 --> 17:28.606
on the coin of
the realm itself.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.274
Money?

17:30.375 --> 17:31.942
Dear God.

17:32.010 --> 17:36.881
They see gold and silver coin
as part of the fallen world.

17:36.948 --> 17:40.250
They would reduce all exchange
to the state of barter

17:40.318 --> 17:42.686
only possible in
the garden of Eden.

17:44.455 --> 17:47.825
And what of banking?

17:49.861 --> 17:52.996
<i>Did Adam need gold coin?</i>

17:53.064 --> 17:55.532
Did Eve need a bank?

17:55.599 --> 17:58.635
Did Cain charge
interest to Abel?

18:02.106 --> 18:05.375
And what of the Church's
deposits in your banks?

18:05.443 --> 18:07.378
They would scatter
them like chaff.

18:09.181 --> 18:13.451
And if they knew, Holy Father,
of your personal accounts,

18:13.519 --> 18:15.653
they would burn
the bank to the ground.

18:15.754 --> 18:16.855
Well, then,

18:16.922 --> 18:19.525
perhaps we had
better have our wealth

18:19.593 --> 18:21.561
brought back to Rome.

18:21.662 --> 18:22.829
How?

18:22.896 --> 18:24.531
The friar has his
spies everywhere.

18:24.598 --> 18:28.735
Perhaps the good
friar could be bought.

18:28.803 --> 18:30.204
With money?

18:30.271 --> 18:31.538
No, bishopric.

18:31.606 --> 18:33.941
The generalship
of the Dominican order.

18:34.009 --> 18:37.411
The Dominican order
already does his bidding.

18:37.479 --> 18:42.016
And how can you buy one who
would outlaw trade itself?

18:42.084 --> 18:45.753
You offer him something
that money cannot buy.

18:47.055 --> 18:49.190
Heaven itself.

18:55.396 --> 18:57.764
Is it good?

18:59.767 --> 19:03.837
Benedictus, Benedicat per
Jesum Christum Dominum Nostrum.

19:28.461 --> 19:31.296
He has the voice of an angel.

19:31.363 --> 19:33.665
Not a soldier, then?

19:33.732 --> 19:35.166
No.

19:35.234 --> 19:38.402
No, never send
this boy to war.

19:49.181 --> 19:52.116
So, you've come back,
Micheletto.

19:52.184 --> 19:54.485
To haunt me.

19:57.556 --> 20:00.792
Must we always meet
among old bones?

20:03.462 --> 20:07.065
You know why.

20:07.166 --> 20:10.302
Ghosts.

20:10.370 --> 20:12.037
Only the dead
should walk here.

20:14.874 --> 20:17.977
And us.

20:21.148 --> 20:22.749
You remember.

20:24.185 --> 20:26.687
I've tried to forget.

20:26.788 --> 20:27.988
You should.

20:28.056 --> 20:29.957
You're to be married,
are you not?

20:31.827 --> 20:33.628
And you?

20:36.198 --> 20:38.166
Did you not forget?

20:46.141 --> 20:48.709
I forget nothing.

21:13.470 --> 21:16.273
My father,
Galeazzo Sforza.

21:16.374 --> 21:18.007
He lost one eye in battle.

21:18.075 --> 21:21.711
His nose then occluded his
vision so he sliced it off.

21:21.779 --> 21:25.181
The Sforzas of Forli
never surrender.

21:25.282 --> 21:26.883
And never kneel.

21:26.951 --> 21:30.052
Oh, we can kneel all right.
But only willingly.

21:47.969 --> 21:51.472
Giorgio will now show
you to your rooms.

22:41.290 --> 22:43.759
Indelicate, Cardinal-

22:45.494 --> 22:48.397
To invade a lady's chamber.

22:48.465 --> 22:51.766
I was led here.
By whom?

22:51.868 --> 22:53.201
Your manservant.

22:53.269 --> 22:56.771
By mistake.
I must have him whipped.

23:00.175 --> 23:02.543
May I leave?

23:02.611 --> 23:05.413
I could scream in terror.
Call my soldiery.

23:05.514 --> 23:07.115
I am still your guest here.

23:07.216 --> 23:09.317
In my room?

23:09.384 --> 23:12.286
An intruder, surely.

23:12.354 --> 23:14.021
So then...

23:14.089 --> 23:16.090
Scream.

23:19.494 --> 23:21.962
Help.

23:38.714 --> 23:42.851
Is that blade truly necessary?

24:13.715 --> 24:16.350
You can stab me with it
whenever you wanted.

24:16.451 --> 24:18.319
Is that a promise?

24:18.386 --> 24:19.987
Ah!

24:20.089 --> 24:21.522
A promise.

24:31.799 --> 24:36.769
I am a freak of nature,
Cardinal.

24:36.837 --> 24:38.704
An aberration.

24:38.772 --> 24:41.708
A free woman in a man's world.

24:41.776 --> 24:44.311
I should deal with
you harshly then.

24:44.378 --> 24:46.780
You should put me down.

24:53.187 --> 24:54.988
Ah!

25:34.393 --> 25:36.962
Your marriage will be a lie.

25:37.030 --> 25:40.366
Like your studies.

25:40.467 --> 25:42.001
But I have no books.

25:42.102 --> 25:44.004
You will have a wife.

25:46.508 --> 25:48.842
I'm a wheelwright,
Micheletto.

25:48.944 --> 25:50.778
I live in Forli.

25:50.846 --> 25:54.015
I will marry in Forli,
and I will die in Forli.

25:54.116 --> 25:55.383
Then come to Rome.

25:55.451 --> 25:58.085
I know what your
life is in Rome.

25:59.954 --> 26:04.657
My life, what is my life,
Augustino?

26:04.758 --> 26:09.461
It does not involve healing.

26:09.529 --> 26:11.697
It involves punishment.

26:11.764 --> 26:16.334
I punish this world for
not being as I want.

26:16.401 --> 26:18.636
And you frighten me.
Huh.

26:18.737 --> 26:21.939
Then you must not
come to Rome.

26:51.403 --> 26:54.840
Those cannon were fake.

26:54.908 --> 26:57.042
What cannon?

26:57.110 --> 27:01.547
I was wondering how you had
whipped up numberless pieces.

27:01.615 --> 27:05.819
Then I heard a rumour.

27:18.232 --> 27:22.502
There was no metal in them.

27:22.603 --> 27:25.505
Plaster, not bronze.

27:27.208 --> 27:29.376
Ah.

27:32.813 --> 27:39.386
Which is the trouble
with you Borgias.

27:39.454 --> 27:41.789
Nothing is what it seems.

27:44.560 --> 27:47.696
We are commoners, my lady.

27:47.763 --> 27:50.499
But of a rare Spanish breed.

28:06.048 --> 28:09.450
So, how do we entice
this friar to Rome?

28:09.518 --> 28:12.520
As you said, with the offer
of a bishopric.

28:12.587 --> 28:15.889
A bishopric may not
be carrot enough.

28:15.990 --> 28:19.159
Maybe a cardinal's hat?

28:19.227 --> 28:21.462
You would have him
sit in Consistory?

28:21.530 --> 28:24.165
Bring his fire and
brimstone to St. Peter's?

28:24.233 --> 28:26.401
We would have
him come to Rome.

28:26.469 --> 28:28.904
Clap him in the dungeons
of the Castell St. Angelo.

28:29.005 --> 28:30.339
Charge him with heresy.

28:30.440 --> 28:31.907
Burn him at the stake?

28:31.975 --> 28:34.076
Do you intend the same
thing for my cousin,

28:34.144 --> 28:35.711
Catherina Sforza?

28:35.779 --> 28:38.314
Dear God,
is she a heretic too?

28:40.616 --> 28:44.019
She is a woman
who bears a man's arms.

28:44.086 --> 28:49.157
We would befriend
your cousin, Cardinal.

28:49.259 --> 28:51.360
We would hold her close-

28:51.461 --> 28:52.995
and dear.

28:54.263 --> 28:57.632
As you hold myself.

28:58.801 --> 29:00.368
Indeed.

29:14.951 --> 29:16.885
<i>Make way there!</i>

29:17.720 --> 29:19.989
<i>Make way for His Holiness!</i>

29:22.960 --> 29:24.995
<i>Stand aside!</i>

29:29.100 --> 29:32.003
<i>Make way for His Holiness,</i>
<i>the Pope of Rome!</i>

29:40.945 --> 29:42.479
Yah!

29:44.849 --> 29:46.716
Yah!

29:46.784 --> 29:48.751
Form up!

30:06.071 --> 30:09.006
A cardinal's stocking, Giulia.

30:09.074 --> 30:11.476
You are indeed observant.

30:13.913 --> 30:17.583
And what do I spy between
those mounds of sleeping flesh?

30:17.684 --> 30:20.385
Why I believe it's-

30:20.486 --> 30:23.721
It's a cardinal.
Another one.

30:23.789 --> 30:25.856
<i>Fuck off.</i>

30:28.193 --> 30:29.760
Oh, can I help you-
ladies?

30:29.861 --> 30:32.162
We're in search of cardinals.

30:32.229 --> 30:34.564
Well, you've come to
the right place then.

30:34.632 --> 30:37.968
We should have called this
place the Sistine Chapel.

30:38.035 --> 30:43.206
But the Sistine Chapel is
fragrant with incense.

30:43.274 --> 30:45.308
Its floors sparkle
with cleanliness.

30:45.410 --> 30:48.545
Here, the cardinals
lie in filth.

30:48.613 --> 30:52.482
As do we, madam.

30:52.549 --> 30:54.117
And you are?

30:55.787 --> 30:57.154
The committee for
the betterment

30:57.222 --> 30:59.957
of the lives of the
ladies of the Roman night.

31:01.293 --> 31:03.227
There is such a committee?

31:03.295 --> 31:05.129
There is now.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.298
And you have the blessing of?

31:07.365 --> 31:09.734
The pope of Rome.

31:09.801 --> 31:15.540
Oh, goodness.

31:15.608 --> 31:19.511
Well, you must come and
meet our madam, then.

31:22.649 --> 31:26.952
Oh Madam, there are some
ladies here to see you!

31:30.857 --> 31:32.024
La Bella.

31:32.092 --> 31:34.694
We so rarely have ladies
within our walls.

31:34.761 --> 31:36.295
Hm...

31:36.363 --> 31:39.131
The girls who work here do
not qualify as ladies, then?

31:39.198 --> 31:40.966
Good God, no.

31:41.033 --> 31:43.234
A lady has a future.

31:43.335 --> 31:45.570
And your girls have none?

31:46.838 --> 31:49.507
Unless they find a patron,
my lady.

31:49.608 --> 31:52.943
As you yourself must know.

31:53.011 --> 31:56.447
I was a courtesan, my dear,
never a streetwalker.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.249
My girls might
walk the streets,

31:58.350 --> 32:00.051
but they ply their trade here.

32:00.152 --> 32:03.488
In the vilest conditions.

32:05.258 --> 32:07.159
And you would
better their lot?

32:07.260 --> 32:08.694
And yours-

32:08.795 --> 32:10.997
if you play your cards right.

32:13.634 --> 32:16.169
You have a certain clientele.

32:16.237 --> 32:18.171
Of clerics.
Cardinals.

32:18.272 --> 32:19.573
I am bound to discretion

32:19.640 --> 32:21.841
with regard to my clientele,
my ladies.

32:21.909 --> 32:25.911
We have a proposition
for you, madam.

32:25.979 --> 32:29.281
That we pay for the
refurbishment of your premises.

32:29.348 --> 32:32.450
We restore it to
cleanliness, comfort,

32:32.551 --> 32:35.953
a condition of
absolute health.

32:36.021 --> 32:37.455
In return for?

32:37.556 --> 32:39.891
Names, on occasion.

32:39.992 --> 32:41.226
Dates.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.261
The details of any cardinal

32:43.329 --> 32:45.797
who crosses the bounds
of propriety.

32:59.180 --> 33:01.548
Huh.

33:09.691 --> 33:13.994
Brother Guiliano, you
bring news from Florence?

33:14.062 --> 33:16.363
Friar Savanarola commanded us

33:16.431 --> 33:18.165
to be the sword
of the apocalypse.

33:18.233 --> 33:21.736
Death himself,
on his pale horse.

33:21.803 --> 33:23.170
But how?

33:23.238 --> 33:26.440
He is surrounded at all
times by a ring of steel.

33:28.009 --> 33:30.011
There may yet be a way.

33:31.981 --> 33:33.581
As the friar has said,

33:33.649 --> 33:37.484
the pope is surrounded
by a ring of steel.

33:37.552 --> 33:39.287
But if we can
penetrate that ring,

33:39.354 --> 33:40.988
discover his weakness...

33:41.056 --> 33:42.457
What is his weakness?

33:42.524 --> 33:44.125
Fornication.

33:44.226 --> 33:46.628
Food. Wine.

33:46.695 --> 33:48.363
And I propose
we use the weapon

33:48.430 --> 33:51.566
the Borgia family
uses so effortlessly.

33:51.634 --> 33:54.369
Against me,
among others.

33:56.338 --> 33:58.439
Cantarella.

34:05.881 --> 34:08.283
I'm afraid I can delay it
no longer, my lady.

34:08.351 --> 34:10.252
Delay what?

34:10.319 --> 34:12.754
The reason for
my presence here.

34:12.822 --> 34:14.389
Oh yes.

34:14.456 --> 34:16.458
There was a reason.

34:16.525 --> 34:19.127
Something to do with Rome.

34:19.228 --> 34:22.230
His Holiness the Pope-
What a pity.

34:22.331 --> 34:24.165
Pity?

34:24.233 --> 34:28.402
To ruin this sweet dalliance
with issues of politics.

34:29.838 --> 34:32.739
When we were
getting on so well.

34:32.808 --> 34:34.909
Indeed.

34:34.976 --> 34:38.946
There is no cause for rancour
between our families.

34:39.013 --> 34:40.581
Is there, my son?

34:41.750 --> 34:43.417
That would be such a pity.

34:43.518 --> 34:45.052
A pity indeed.

34:46.987 --> 34:52.059
But proceed, Cardinal,
if you must.

34:52.159 --> 34:53.627
His Holiness dictates

34:53.695 --> 34:55.596
that if you do not
come to Rome willingly-

34:55.663 --> 34:57.497
Oh.

34:57.565 --> 35:00.668
Now you have quite
put me off my duck.

35:00.735 --> 35:02.669
And I sense a threat
behind those words.

35:02.737 --> 35:05.139
Perhaps a "choice" would
be the better word.

35:05.207 --> 35:06.874
Oh dear.

35:06.941 --> 35:08.543
A choice.

35:08.610 --> 35:11.645
And I am so bad at choosing.

35:11.713 --> 35:16.317
He would have you travel to
Rome willingly or in chains.

35:16.384 --> 35:19.586
And this duck did
taste so good.

35:19.653 --> 35:20.854
Hmm...

35:23.957 --> 35:27.392
You must break fast with me
tomorrow, Cardinal.

35:27.460 --> 35:30.228
I will give you
my answer then.

35:30.329 --> 35:31.796
And now...

35:35.635 --> 35:38.604
let me show you
to your rooms.

35:43.009 --> 35:44.410
Tell me your answer.

35:44.478 --> 35:47.346
You shall have it
in the morning.

35:47.414 --> 35:49.148
I think I know it already.

35:50.618 --> 35:52.786
What do you care
if I come to Rome?

35:52.854 --> 35:54.988
The pope has made an edict-

35:55.056 --> 35:56.723
Written on paper?

35:56.824 --> 35:58.591
Or plaster,
like your cannon?

35:58.659 --> 36:00.326
So, your answer is no?

36:00.394 --> 36:01.995
You said I had a choice.

36:02.096 --> 36:04.063
To go willingly...

36:04.164 --> 36:06.532
or to go in chains.

36:06.599 --> 36:09.167
Who is going to chain me?

36:09.235 --> 36:11.502
You?

36:11.570 --> 36:13.237
Someday, perhaps.

36:13.305 --> 36:16.240
Your brother?

36:16.308 --> 36:18.610
I have heard of his bluster.

36:18.711 --> 36:22.881
Fake, again, like your cannon.

36:22.949 --> 36:25.084
Let us dispense then
with these niceties,

36:25.151 --> 36:26.519
and let me leave.

36:26.587 --> 36:30.824
Oh, but that, Cardinal,
I am not yet prepared for.

36:30.891 --> 36:33.260
You think I appreciate
this game of yours?

36:33.327 --> 36:36.596
No.
But I do.

36:36.664 --> 36:39.165
And you did admit,
Cardinal...

36:40.501 --> 36:43.369
...the game is mine.

36:43.436 --> 36:45.804
The bed is mine.

36:45.905 --> 36:47.705
The choice is mine.

36:47.773 --> 36:50.641
And...

36:51.977 --> 36:53.544
Hmmm.

36:53.645 --> 36:57.648
...for one more
night at least,

36:57.749 --> 37:00.083
you may be mine.

37:06.725 --> 37:11.094
As a poison, cantarella
is undetectable.

37:11.162 --> 37:13.563
If given a sufficient dosage,

37:13.664 --> 37:16.833
it will definitely be fatal.

37:16.901 --> 37:19.802
But the pope has tasters
for his food, his wine.

37:19.870 --> 37:21.904
He does indeed.

37:22.006 --> 37:25.708
So one of us must seek
employment as his taster.

37:25.775 --> 37:28.810
And be prepared to
die for our cause.

37:35.551 --> 37:40.388
Is there one among us
who is willing to die?

37:40.490 --> 37:42.457
To administer the poison?

37:42.525 --> 37:45.661
Taste the poison?

37:45.729 --> 37:49.466
Serve it to the Pope of Rome
and share his fate?

37:50.634 --> 37:54.705
If one among you can
find it in his heart

37:54.773 --> 37:58.742
to offer himself
for this sacrifice,

37:58.843 --> 38:00.644
think carefully.

38:00.712 --> 38:04.081
Make your peace
with God first.

38:04.148 --> 38:07.351
And only then come forward.

38:16.460 --> 38:19.630
I of all people know...

38:19.697 --> 38:23.100
It will be a terrible death.

38:41.053 --> 38:42.553
Ahh!

38:57.636 --> 39:01.039
You should throw away those
cardinal robes, you know.

39:01.140 --> 39:02.306
I thought I had.

39:02.408 --> 39:03.741
You should wear armour.

39:03.809 --> 39:05.943
This body of yours
deserves nothing less.

39:06.044 --> 39:07.611
Ahh!

39:19.091 --> 39:20.959
Micheletto.

39:21.026 --> 39:23.161
We cannot meet again.

39:23.229 --> 39:24.296
Why?

39:24.363 --> 39:25.598
If I were found in your arms,

39:25.665 --> 39:27.232
I'd be disembowelled
and burnt.

39:27.300 --> 39:29.335
It's a cruel world.

39:29.436 --> 39:31.137
Too cruel.

39:34.208 --> 39:39.045
Now, I have killed many,

39:39.112 --> 39:41.513
with an embrace such as this.

39:41.614 --> 39:44.150
Did you love them too?

39:44.251 --> 39:46.485
This grave-

39:46.553 --> 39:49.154
this is my father's
grave and I loved him.

39:49.222 --> 39:51.122
When I held his head, thus-

39:56.195 --> 39:59.431
Now, you go
and you be married.

39:59.499 --> 40:01.801
St. Paul says
it is better to marry...

40:05.840 --> 40:08.442
Than to burn.

40:27.296 --> 40:29.430
You came.

40:29.498 --> 40:31.433
When called.

40:31.500 --> 40:34.169
Walk with me.

40:34.237 --> 40:36.705
We have a choice, it seems.

40:56.661 --> 40:58.596
You seek one who
would give his life

40:58.663 --> 41:01.532
to restore the
church to its glory.

41:03.768 --> 41:06.103
Yes.

41:06.204 --> 41:08.639
And you don't offer yourself?

41:08.707 --> 41:14.279
This is too well known.

41:14.346 --> 41:16.448
So...

41:16.516 --> 41:21.920
You need one without fame,
without acquaintance,

41:21.988 --> 41:24.457
a neophyte within
the Vatican walls.

41:24.524 --> 41:26.559
Nobody can know of him.

41:26.660 --> 41:28.762
Nobody knows of me.

41:33.569 --> 41:37.005
You realize the
implications of your words?

41:37.073 --> 41:38.573
Yes.

41:38.640 --> 41:41.910
I would gladly die to rid the
world of the Borgia pope.

41:43.512 --> 41:45.113
By poison.

41:46.614 --> 41:49.216
Cantarella.

41:49.283 --> 41:53.553
It will be a grisly death.

41:55.556 --> 41:58.024
But Heaven will await my soul.

42:01.261 --> 42:03.596
I would welcome it.

42:38.835 --> 42:41.336
Corpus Domini Nostri
Iesu Christi

42:41.404 --> 42:43.972
custodiat animam meam
in vitam aeternam.

42:44.040 --> 42:45.774
Amen.

42:52.282 --> 42:54.049
Cardinal.

42:56.919 --> 42:58.486
Your lady is-

42:58.554 --> 43:00.856
Lady Sforza is awake.

43:08.565 --> 43:10.400
My Lord Sforza.

43:10.467 --> 43:12.235
I arrived in the early hours.

43:12.336 --> 43:14.370
You must have.

43:14.438 --> 43:17.506
You have business
with your cousin?

43:17.574 --> 43:20.510
On matters of state, always.

43:20.577 --> 43:22.411
So she requested
your presence here?

43:22.479 --> 43:25.815
She told me it would
be appreciated.

43:25.882 --> 43:27.316
Hmm...

43:27.384 --> 43:29.719
And can you tell me why?

43:29.786 --> 43:32.788
You brought your father's
proposal with you.

43:32.889 --> 43:36.158
My father, the pope?

43:36.259 --> 43:39.062
I can only think of him
as your father.

43:39.163 --> 43:40.864
And the father of that...

43:40.932 --> 43:42.599
slattern I was tricked
into marrying.

43:42.667 --> 43:44.368
Be careful, Lord Sforza.

43:44.469 --> 43:45.803
Of what?

43:45.871 --> 43:48.272
I hold my sister's
interests dear.

43:49.642 --> 43:53.044
Hmm...
I am aware of that.

43:53.112 --> 43:56.014
You humiliated me before
the whole of Rome.

44:19.770 --> 44:22.072
Corpus Domini Nostri
Iesu Christi

44:22.139 --> 44:24.808
custodiat animam tuam
in vitam aeternam.

44:24.876 --> 44:26.210
Amen.

44:27.112 --> 44:29.914
You shall have your answer,
Cesare Borgia.

44:29.982 --> 44:32.617
It is why I am still here,
my lady.

44:32.684 --> 44:35.887
My answer is simple.

44:35.955 --> 44:37.188
It is no.

44:44.529 --> 44:46.664
Let me be clear.

44:46.765 --> 44:48.732
You refuse to come to Rome?

44:48.799 --> 44:51.301
My cousin refuses
to debase herself

44:51.369 --> 44:54.538
before that swine that
wears the papal tiara.

44:54.605 --> 44:57.274
That question was for her,
my lord.

44:57.375 --> 44:58.575
And you have her answer.

44:58.643 --> 45:01.878
Yes and you will have mine.

45:01.946 --> 45:04.648
Ahh!
Ahh!

45:15.359 --> 45:17.927
Run!

45:30.605 --> 45:32.539
I promised my sister
your heart-

45:32.607 --> 45:33.940
on a dinner plate!

46:20.521 --> 46:22.088
<i>Holy Father!</i>

46:22.156 --> 46:25.292
Ahh!
Ahh!

46:25.360 --> 46:27.693
I can find no heart!

46:30.397 --> 46:32.765
Stay there!
Don't move!

46:34.401 --> 46:35.868
Go! Now go!
Go!

46:35.969 --> 46:39.238
Run, run, run!

46:41.108 --> 46:43.409
Ah! Ah!

46:49.216 --> 46:53.319
<i>Murder! Murder!</i>

46:53.420 --> 46:55.555
<i>Murder!</i>

46:55.622 --> 46:57.891
<i>You!</i>
<i>Come with me!</i>

46:58.993 --> 47:01.060
No...

47:01.161 --> 47:02.895
No!

47:02.963 --> 47:05.331
<i>Guards, stop him!</i>

47:05.398 --> 47:06.765
Here!

47:07.734 --> 47:09.535
Oh!

47:14.774 --> 47:17.176
Ahh...

47:17.277 --> 47:18.811
Help!

47:18.912 --> 47:21.414
<i>Somebody, help!</i>

47:34.995 --> 47:36.329
Oh please God.

47:36.396 --> 47:38.230
Oh, come.

47:41.934 --> 47:43.235
Come on.

47:43.302 --> 47:44.969
Are you...

47:45.037 --> 47:47.405
Papa, I can't...
Shh.

47:47.473 --> 47:48.906
...feel my leg.

47:49.007 --> 47:51.275
Ohh...

47:51.376 --> 47:53.343
We'll get you some help.

47:53.411 --> 47:55.646
<i>Borgia!</i>

47:57.282 --> 47:59.350
No!

48:01.854 --> 48:03.054
<i>Stop him!</i>

48:03.122 --> 48:04.556
Micheletto!

48:05.858 --> 48:07.692
Seal the city!

48:08.728 --> 48:11.263
Yah! Yah!

48:11.331 --> 48:13.799
<i>Archers ready!</i>
<i>Release!</i>

48:13.867 --> 48:15.634
<i>Shoot them!</i>

48:24.377 --> 48:26.111
Papa...

48:26.179 --> 48:29.815
What...

48:29.882 --> 48:31.650
Oh, no.
Oh...

48:33.853 --> 48:35.720
Oh!

48:38.057 --> 48:41.493
Ego te absolve ab omnibus
censuris, a peccatis,

48:41.561 --> 48:43.996
in nomine Patris et
Filii et Spiritus sancti.

48:44.097 --> 48:45.932
Amen.

48:48.135 --> 48:50.170
We should ride different ways.

48:50.238 --> 48:52.205
Wrap this in your saddlebag.

48:52.273 --> 48:54.208
I would give it to my sister.

48:54.309 --> 48:56.010
Whose blood?

48:56.111 --> 48:58.011
Giovanni Sforza's.

48:59.814 --> 49:01.448
Come!
Yah!

49:05.119 --> 49:06.486
There are others
alive in there!

49:06.587 --> 49:08.121
Let me, Holy Father.

49:08.189 --> 49:10.824
So, if anybody's willing...

49:10.892 --> 49:14.694
It is the judgment of God,
Holy Father.

49:14.762 --> 49:17.230
And God will judge
your actions now!

49:17.297 --> 49:20.400
So, please, if anyone
is willing...

49:22.370 --> 49:23.671
<i>Wait!</i>

50:23.836 --> 50:28.339
Was it a sign from God,
Cardinal?

50:28.407 --> 50:30.675
No, Your Holiness.

50:30.743 --> 50:34.078
It was a bolt of lightning.

50:39.718 --> 50:42.486
It signalled
His displeasure.

50:48.793 --> 50:53.162
We must atone
for our...

50:57.201 --> 50:59.436
...sins...

51:05.577 --> 51:08.880
...with fasting
and prayer.

51:12.219 --> 51:13.719
For how long?

51:15.355 --> 51:17.322
Until He...

51:17.390 --> 51:22.527
smiles on us
again.
