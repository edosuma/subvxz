00:02.160 --> 00:03.924
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.080 --> 00:07.243
The scheme was to destroy vampires
by making them feed on each other.

00:07.440 --> 00:09.761
- What's happening to you?
- Karma's happening to me.

00:11.080 --> 00:14.084
My name is Nadia Petrova.
You are my mother.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.806
This knife's the only thing
that will kill a Passenger.

00:20.920 --> 00:23.605
I'll passenger myself
into Elena's cute little head.

00:23.840 --> 00:27.401
She's acting strange.
She kissed me. Matt texted "Help

00:27.600 --> 00:29.443
- ...as in Katherine.
- Oh, my God.

00:29.600 --> 00:32.331
You won't have to
worry about me for much longer.

00:33.080 --> 00:34.969
Tyler Lockwood bit me.

00:54.480 --> 00:55.845
Good evening, sir.

00:56.040 --> 00:59.044
If I could trouble you for a moment.
I'm looking for someone.

00:59.880 --> 01:01.564
Her name is Katerina Petrova.

01:02.440 --> 01:06.001
She was last seen
outside of London in 1492.

01:06.160 --> 01:07.924
She's on the run.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.927
I need to find her.

01:11.640 --> 01:13.802
I need to ask her why she abandoned me.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.004
- Nadia?
- Please...

01:18.080 --> 01:19.491
I need to know.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.004
Nadia? I'm right here.

01:23.160 --> 01:24.525
I'm right here.

01:33.520 --> 01:35.170
I was dreaming...

01:35.760 --> 01:38.206
how I searched for you
from village to village.

01:38.400 --> 01:41.210
I know, I heard you.
You said that I abandoned you.

01:41.400 --> 01:45.041
You were ripped from my arms as a baby.
It's completely different.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.850
Not for a child without a mother.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.531
You know...

01:48.680 --> 01:53.129
all this guilt is really taking all the
fun out of this mother-daughter outing.

01:53.320 --> 01:56.529
I'm sorry Tyler bit you,
but you're not going to die.

01:57.640 --> 01:59.210
Did you ask Klaus for his blood?

01:59.440 --> 02:02.649
Oh, my, you really are delirious.

02:03.120 --> 02:06.363
Nadia, he would love nothing more
than to watch my daughter die.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.039
And you don't want to risk being outed.

02:09.720 --> 02:10.800
No, I don't.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.723
So that's why I called him.

02:15.960 --> 02:18.008
Nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Maxfield.

02:18.240 --> 02:21.210
Luckily for us, he'd love nothing more
than to study your blood.

02:21.400 --> 02:24.244
Well, werewolf venom isn't easy to come by.

02:25.720 --> 02:27.882
- Get away from me.
- It's okay.

02:28.080 --> 02:30.401
- Nadia, it's okay.
- Listen to your mother.

02:30.560 --> 02:33.723
The venom in your blood is a toxin
with basic chemical properties.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.482
Once I study its makeup,
I can create the antidote.

02:38.760 --> 02:41.445
It's okay, come on, come on. There you go.

02:44.520 --> 02:48.320
If I'd known I just had to die
to drag your attention from Stefan...

02:49.240 --> 02:51.971
I would have tried it a long time ago.

02:54.360 --> 02:57.091
If you're trying to make me feel guilty...

02:57.840 --> 02:59.285
it's almost working.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.967
I'm just glad you're here now.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.130
Me too.

03:06.760 --> 03:09.923
I'm going to be a better mother
starting right now.

03:11.120 --> 03:13.009
I promise you...

03:14.960 --> 03:17.122
I'm going to save your life.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.641
She is brilliant.

03:26.800 --> 03:31.283
We haven't noticed that Katherine's
been inhabiting Elena's body for weeks...

03:31.560 --> 03:34.484
- ...and that's all you have to say?
- Yep.

03:34.640 --> 03:38.326
And you realize that it was
Katherine who broke up with you.

03:38.560 --> 03:41.325
- It wasn't, uh, Elena.
- Mm-hm.

03:41.480 --> 03:46.805
Right. So your little
murder spree with Enzo...

03:47.000 --> 03:49.162
where you, uh, killed Aaron...

03:49.320 --> 03:53.325
nearly killed Jeremy, tried to kill Wes
but got infected with that Ripper virus...

03:53.560 --> 03:57.167
that was all you reacting to Katherine.

03:57.400 --> 04:01.007
I'm trying to figure out
why you decided to tell...

04:01.160 --> 04:05.006
a starving, bloodthirsty,
vampire-feeding Ripper...

04:05.160 --> 04:08.004
that his nemesis is still
walking around alive and well...

04:08.160 --> 04:11.687
while I'm stuck in this cell
and can't do anything about it.

04:11.840 --> 04:15.322
- I have it under control.
- I'd love to hear this.

04:15.560 --> 04:19.166
Hang on, here. Katherine's still alive?
How is that even possible?

04:19.360 --> 04:22.489
Remember that time Nadia's ex,
Gregor, hitched a ride in your head?

04:22.680 --> 04:26.207
Okay, well, it's kind of the same thing.
Katherine is a Passenger in Elena.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.806
Except it's worse,
because none of us noticed.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.321
She was at my house.
How did we not figure it out?

04:31.520 --> 04:36.048
Because it's Katherine. And she's smart
and conniving and sneaky...

04:37.400 --> 04:38.890
and we're the worst friends ever.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.641
<i>This makes no sense.</i>

04:40.800 --> 04:44.168
She saved my life. She gave me CPR
when Enzo tried to kill me.

04:44.360 --> 04:47.364
- Katherine would never do that.
- That's what made her believable.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.723
She played Elena to a tee.
If she let you die, her cover was blown.

04:50.880 --> 04:54.327
I was sleeping three feet away from her.
She picked my Bitter Ball dress.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.085
And I let her use my toothpaste.

04:56.280 --> 04:59.648
Yeah, well, did she lure you into
a hotel room to make out with you?

05:01.320 --> 05:03.891
She's the reason I found out
about you and Klaus.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.731
Of course. Oh, my God.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.886
So how do we kill the bitch?

05:10.400 --> 05:14.724
Well, Passengers can be expelled
from the host. I saw it happen with Matt.

05:15.200 --> 05:19.046
Gregor died and Matt lived. All we have
to do is stab her with the Traveler knife.

05:19.240 --> 05:22.722
- I still have the knife that Nadia gave me.
Perfect, go get it.

05:22.920 --> 05:25.321
Guys, this is Katherine
that we're talking about.

05:25.520 --> 05:28.729
She's gonna see a sneak attack
coming from a mile away.

05:28.920 --> 05:31.890
We got to get her to come to us.
Get her guard down, corner her.

05:32.080 --> 05:35.766
Fat chance you'll be seeing her today.
I'm pretty sure I bit Nadia.

05:36.760 --> 05:38.569
What do you mean you bit her?

05:38.760 --> 05:41.081
I mean she was attacking Caroline
and I nipped her.

05:41.240 --> 05:44.084
- And you're just mentioning this now?
- Hey, guys, focus.

05:44.280 --> 05:47.124
Tyler's right. Katherine is
not going to leave Nadia's side...

05:47.360 --> 05:50.091
unless not leaving
compromises her identity.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.169
Which means?

05:52.880 --> 05:56.089
We got to invite her to something
that Elena can't say no to.

05:56.280 --> 05:59.090
A surprise party? Seriously?

05:59.280 --> 06:00.645
I wanted a spa day.

06:01.280 --> 06:04.807
Try feeling the death of every supernatural
creature who passes through you.

06:05.040 --> 06:08.806
I'm not saying you don't deserve it.
Besides, her birthday isn't until next week.

06:09.040 --> 06:10.804
That's what makes it a surprise.

06:10.960 --> 06:15.045
Yeah, I don't think Bonnie
would want a big party for her birthday.

06:15.240 --> 06:19.131
Of course she does. So when can you
get over to Stefan's to help us set up?

06:21.200 --> 06:23.680
- I can't.
- You can't?

06:23.880 --> 06:27.965
I would love to, but I just...
I can't. Um...

06:29.480 --> 06:32.211
I'm making arrangements
for Aaron Whitmore's funeral.

06:32.440 --> 06:35.489
The only reason Damon killed him
was because we broke up...

06:35.680 --> 06:37.728
so I kind of feel
like I owe it to Aaron.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.690
- You understand, right?
- Of course.

06:41.920 --> 06:44.321
No, that's really nice of you.

06:48.840 --> 06:51.844
Elena, you're so popular today.

06:53.120 --> 06:56.283
- Hey, Bonnie.
- Hey, how's it going?

06:56.480 --> 06:57.766
You sound tired.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.850
<i>Yeah, I had to pull an all-nighter
for my sociology exam...</i>

07:01.000 --> 07:04.800
then woke up to a coven of dead witches
passing through me to the Other Side.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.368
Sorry, self-pity. So not cute.

07:08.520 --> 07:12.650
No, I totally get it. it's...
You're the anchor now.

07:12.840 --> 07:16.208
It must be exhausting.

07:16.360 --> 07:19.443
Do you want to maybe
meet up for coffee or something?

07:19.640 --> 07:22.041
It's just been one of those days, you know?

07:22.280 --> 07:25.329
Yeah, well, heh, this
is gonna sound crazy...

07:25.520 --> 07:28.364
but I'm actually at
the day spa right now...

07:28.520 --> 07:31.205
buying you a gift certificate
for your birthday.

07:31.360 --> 07:35.251
It was supposed to be a surprise,
but, well, surprise. Heh.

07:35.720 --> 07:38.371
You read my mind. That's so you.

07:39.440 --> 07:43.206
- Hey, look, um, I'll check in with you later.
- Okay.

07:44.480 --> 07:46.960
Why are they being so clingy today?

07:52.760 --> 07:54.330
What are you doing?

07:57.520 --> 07:59.488
Here you go. Drink.

08:06.240 --> 08:08.083
- I need more.
- Too bad.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.561
- That was nothing.
- That's exactly four ounces.

08:10.800 --> 08:15.408
When you were out killing vampires, you said
one vampire kept you good for eight hours...

08:15.560 --> 08:18.245
- ...so our friend Caroline did a little math...
- Caroline?

08:18.400 --> 08:22.610
Relax, she had a calculator.
So four ounces, three times a day...

08:22.840 --> 08:26.003
should be just enough
to help manage the hunger.

08:29.920 --> 08:33.163
- You mean manage me.
- So you don't rip anyone's head off.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.443
And we'll deal with your crisis
once we get Elena back.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.922
I'll deal with my own crisis.
Listen, you just let me out of here.

08:40.200 --> 08:44.125
<i>- I'll</i> find Wes, I'll get the antidote.
- And then what, huh? You skip town?

08:44.320 --> 08:49.087
Leave it to me to tell Elena everything you
did after you thought she broke up with you?

08:49.280 --> 08:50.611
No.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.609
Who you calling there, buddy?

08:54.840 --> 08:58.970
Katherine's been making a lot of excuses and
I have a feeling she won't say no to me.

09:07.440 --> 09:08.487
It's your phone.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.962
Elena is calling.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.245
Answer it.

09:16.840 --> 09:18.968
Elena. Hey.

09:19.160 --> 09:20.605
Hey. Um...

09:21.160 --> 09:25.165
- How are you?
- Well, you know, strung up. Hungry.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.805
Same old same old.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.482
Now that the dust has settled...

09:29.640 --> 09:32.723
I was hoping that, I
don't know, maybe...

09:32.960 --> 09:35.770
we can talk about
what happened at the farmhouse.

09:36.360 --> 09:37.486
Can I see you?

09:38.600 --> 09:41.171
Okay. Sure.

09:41.360 --> 09:44.170
Why don't you come to the house
and we'll talk about it here.

09:44.680 --> 09:46.842
Perfect. I'll see you soon.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.162
Okay. Bye.

09:54.520 --> 09:59.447
Damon knows that he tried
to kill me less than 24 hours ago.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.369
There isn't a single vampire-craving
bone in his body...

10:04.520 --> 10:09.208
that would risk putting his precious
Elena back in that kind of danger again.

10:09.440 --> 10:12.683
And yet he's desperate to see her.

10:12.920 --> 10:14.365
Just like her other friends.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.485
They know.

10:22.720 --> 10:24.006
<i>Doesn't make any sense.</i>

10:24.200 --> 10:26.567
She's dodged everyone
trying to get her over here.

10:26.720 --> 10:29.929
- Now she voluntarily wants to come over?
- Unless...

10:30.520 --> 10:31.567
Unless...

10:33.040 --> 10:35.042
She was testing me.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.449
She knows.

11:00.600 --> 11:02.011
Money for information.

11:02.520 --> 11:05.410
I was told you saw Katerina Petrova
kill a man in cold blood...

11:05.640 --> 11:08.246
outside the court of Versailles.

11:08.400 --> 11:11.051
I want to know if that's true.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.367
I want to know
what kind of person my mother is.

11:15.440 --> 11:18.011
She's been on the run for...

11:20.760 --> 11:23.286
228 years.

11:24.040 --> 11:28.682
You passed out in the car.
I didn't want to wake you.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.361
Perfect.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.688
I can make my peace with the universe.

11:39.080 --> 11:40.491
Don't talk like that.

11:40.720 --> 11:44.566
I brought you here so that I could hide you
until Wes finds a way to heal you.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.371
You should leave now.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.684
While you can.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.689
There's no point in trying to save me.

11:50.880 --> 11:52.564
I didn't raise you to be a quitter.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.607
And I promise, as soon as
you get better, we're leaving.

12:00.360 --> 12:01.566
Together.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.324
Of course. The farther she gets, the worse
our chances are of ever seeing Elena again.

12:08.520 --> 12:11.683
I mean, it's bad enough
that we didn't recognize Katherine...

12:11.880 --> 12:16.807
Nothing a little locator spell can't fix.

12:30.480 --> 12:33.211
Let me guess. Matter of life and death?

12:33.400 --> 12:37.962
Kind of, yeah. Um, do you remember
that locator spell we did the other night?

12:38.160 --> 12:42.085
Sure. We ended up saving him.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.924
You're welcome, by the way.

12:47.080 --> 12:48.969
Now we need you to find his sister.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.409
Why? She run away from home?

12:51.600 --> 12:54.968
No, she's been possessed
by her evil doppelganger.

12:55.600 --> 12:59.764
- Okay.
- Liv, will you help us?

13:02.040 --> 13:03.405
I can be convinced.

13:07.640 --> 13:09.369
I need blood.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.489
You just had your lunch 30 minutes ago.

13:11.720 --> 13:16.044
Or you could give me
a couple sips of that hybrid juice.

13:16.240 --> 13:20.609
I can be on my way and
I'll take up my Ripper situation with Wes.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.006
Not gonna happen.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.004
Can I ask you a question
without you getting all wolf man on me?

13:30.240 --> 13:31.605
Do I have a choice?

13:32.320 --> 13:34.049
Why are you still here?

13:34.280 --> 13:36.123
I'm a hybrid and you need a babysitter.

13:36.320 --> 13:39.688
No, no. I mean "here" here.
In Mystic Falls here.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.969
Your family's dead and I don't
see you getting a job at the Grill.

13:43.160 --> 13:46.243
And yet I don't see you
in a Whitmore hoodie either.

13:46.440 --> 13:49.330
Something tells me that there's
a little masochistic voice...

13:49.520 --> 13:51.921
inside your head
that's trying to convince you...

13:52.120 --> 13:56.921
that you and Caroline
still have a fighting chance in hell.

13:57.800 --> 14:01.043
I think you have enough problems
without having to worry about me.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.242
Oh, you're probably right.

14:05.480 --> 14:08.768
One small difference between you and me.
You want to hear it?

14:08.960 --> 14:13.921
- Not especially.
- You see, even after all the terrible things I do...

14:14.120 --> 14:16.441
Elena still chose me.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.290
Because she's fighting for me.

14:18.480 --> 14:22.246
Caroline, on the other hand,
chose the nuclear option.

14:22.440 --> 14:26.331
You know that big red button that nukes
your entire relationship once and for all?

14:26.520 --> 14:29.126
Well, sleeping with the guy
that killed your morn...

14:29.320 --> 14:31.721
was kind of her way
of slamming her hand down.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.008
You think Elena
will want you back after this?

14:36.200 --> 14:40.250
It's over, Damon.
Fix yourself and run. Far away.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.563
I plan on it.
How's New Orleans this time of year?

14:44.960 --> 14:47.566
You really think Elena's gonna forgive you?

14:48.120 --> 14:50.851
Look at you. You killed her friend.

14:51.040 --> 14:54.567
You almost killed her brother. You
nearly killed her. You're a joke, Damon.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.491
Says the guy pining for
the girl who slept with Klaus.

14:58.480 --> 15:02.405
- You don't know anything about me.
- I know how to get you in this cell.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.251
Hey, ready for a changing of the guard?

15:24.480 --> 15:27.529
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.364
- I'm okay.
- He fed on you?

15:29.560 --> 15:31.881
- I said I'm fine.
- Why would you come in here?

15:32.120 --> 15:35.681
Why do you think?
Damon knew exactly how to piss me off.

15:37.200 --> 15:40.647
- What the hell happened?
- I think Damon went to go find Wes.

15:45.200 --> 15:48.682
Elena's necklace, candle, map.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.524
Give me your hand.

15:52.040 --> 15:55.203
You're Elena's brother,
that makes you blood, so hand it over.

15:55.360 --> 15:58.045
Actually, he's her cousin.
It's a long story.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.726
Whatever. Close enough.

16:03.560 --> 16:05.085
That's not how I taught you.

16:06.560 --> 16:07.925
Relax, Mr. Miyagi.

16:08.560 --> 16:12.167
I'm feeling my way through it, okay?
Now, what do I say again?

16:26.400 --> 16:27.925
Does Elena look anything like you?

16:28.080 --> 16:29.923
Uh, same color hair.

16:30.080 --> 16:32.208
What about her eyes?
They as pretty as yours?

16:32.400 --> 16:34.721
- Is this really necessary?
- I'm sorry.

16:34.920 --> 16:39.403
I'm searching for his sister/cousin's
doppelganger in my mind.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.250
I'll take all the help I can get.

17:01.960 --> 17:04.281
Does your sister
spend a lot of time in church?

17:06.160 --> 17:08.242
You leaving?

17:08.440 --> 17:11.410
I'm going to check on Wes.
He's taking too long.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.443
Be careful.

17:14.079 --> 17:15.605
They're all out looking for you.

17:16.599 --> 17:19.285
- That's never stopped me before.
- Heh.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.650
Hello?

17:57.600 --> 17:59.841
- What's up, doc?
- How did you find me?

18:00.000 --> 18:04.130
I called my friend Enzo, asked him about
the little adventure he had with you.

18:04.520 --> 18:08.650
Gotta say, long way off
the tenure track, huh? Heh.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.685
Take it the Augustine Society
hit a bit of a rough streak?

18:11.920 --> 18:15.686
There is no Augustine Society, Damon.
It's just me.

18:16.520 --> 18:18.488
Well, then I guess you're my guy.

18:19.480 --> 18:22.689
See, I have this long road ahead of me
to win my ex-girlfriend back...

18:22.920 --> 18:26.447
but I don't have a chance in hell
if I'm lusting over her blood.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.001
You follow?

18:28.200 --> 18:31.363
Even if I did cure you of this virus,
what difference does it make?

18:31.560 --> 18:35.360
So you stop feeding on your friends and you
go back to feeding on innocent people?

18:35.560 --> 18:38.564
Is that really gonna impress Elena Gilbert?

18:40.360 --> 18:43.364
Look at me. You did this to me.

18:43.520 --> 18:45.727
I didn't do this to you. You are this.

18:45.960 --> 18:47.724
I simply held up the mirror.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.690
Now it's my turn to play doctor.

19:22.360 --> 19:23.486
That was fun.

19:24.640 --> 19:27.564
- You think?
- You must really trust Rebekah.

19:28.360 --> 19:33.048
- What?
- Watch this. I'm going to steal her earrings...

19:37.560 --> 19:39.403
and you're not going to say anything.

19:40.120 --> 19:44.523
See? You're hanging out
with an Original vampire...

19:44.720 --> 19:46.609
and you're not even on vervain.

19:47.080 --> 19:49.447
- Trust.
- You know she's an Original?

19:49.640 --> 19:51.563
I recognized her on the dance floor.

19:51.760 --> 19:57.563
I was hoping she'd know something about
her brother Klaus' favorite vampire...

19:58.080 --> 20:01.448
Katherine Pierce.
Maybe you've heard of her?

20:01.800 --> 20:03.290
Yeah.

20:04.800 --> 20:07.406
Yeah, I've heard of her. I know her.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.962
- Why do you care?
- Because she is my mother...

20:12.480 --> 20:14.642
and I'd very much like to meet her.

20:17.120 --> 20:19.566
I'm going to take your ring.

20:22.120 --> 20:24.088
Now I have a reason to see you again.

20:30.840 --> 20:34.447
Wes! What the hell is taking so lo...?

20:35.680 --> 20:38.490
No. No.

20:38.640 --> 20:42.326
No, no, no. No, please, no. No.

20:57.680 --> 21:01.162
- Nadia, I'm coming back to the church now.
- She's not at the church anymore.

21:01.400 --> 21:02.606
She's with me at home.

21:06.840 --> 21:11.004
<i>- Stefan,</i> why <i>do you</i> have <i>Nadia's phone?
- She doesn't have much time left, Katherine.</i>

21:13.200 --> 21:15.043
I don't know what you're talking about.

21:15.240 --> 21:18.369
I know that it's you,
and I know that you care about Nadia.

21:18.520 --> 21:20.682
<i>That's why I brought her here.</i>

21:21.200 --> 21:22.929
Prove it.

21:23.520 --> 21:24.885
Put her on the phone.

21:35.680 --> 21:37.364
<i>Katherine.</i>

21:40.240 --> 21:41.446
Run.

21:44.760 --> 21:47.411
You can always run, Katherine.
That's what you do best.

21:47.640 --> 21:51.725
<i>Or you can come home and see your daughter
one last time before she dies.</i>

21:52.920 --> 21:54.729
It's your choice.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.090
<i>Hey-</i>

22:13.920 --> 22:15.604
Lift up.

22:23.240 --> 22:25.447
Your hands are like ice.

22:27.400 --> 22:28.447
Gregor?

22:29.080 --> 22:30.366
No, it's Matt. I'm not...

22:30.600 --> 22:32.602
Gregor, I'm sorry I betrayed you.

22:35.360 --> 22:37.283
I did it for my mother.

22:37.760 --> 22:39.762
I did everything for her.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.728
I know you did.

22:45.840 --> 22:47.808
Forgive me?

22:52.320 --> 22:55.642
Yes. I forgive you.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.881
Hey. Hey. Shh.

23:03.040 --> 23:04.121
It's okay.

23:04.480 --> 23:06.608
It's okay. Shh.

23:11.960 --> 23:13.644
I don't want to die.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.562
I don't want to die.

23:32.520 --> 23:34.682
What's gonna happen when I die?

23:36.400 --> 23:38.528
I'll take your hand...

23:39.320 --> 23:41.004
and you'll go to the Other Side.

23:42.320 --> 23:43.845
Just like that.

23:45.680 --> 23:47.011
Will it hurt?

23:48.600 --> 23:50.682
You won't feel any pain.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.362
I'm here to see my daughter.

24:08.720 --> 24:09.846
Nadia.

24:18.720 --> 24:20.370
You came back for me.

24:21.480 --> 24:22.970
I won't leave you again.

24:23.720 --> 24:25.722
Did you find a way to save me?

24:29.960 --> 24:32.725
Klaus' blood would've saved you.

24:34.880 --> 24:37.042
If I'd asked for it.

24:38.240 --> 24:40.288
You would have outed yourself.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.244
But you would have been alive.

24:45.400 --> 24:46.890
And now it's too late.

25:00.480 --> 25:02.448
My mother's name is Katherine.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.450
I'm looking for her.

25:06.640 --> 25:07.766
You found me.

25:07.960 --> 25:09.485
Nadia, I'm right here.

25:10.920 --> 25:12.922
She is a liar.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.120
And a murderer.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.128
She manipulates.

25:19.680 --> 25:21.603
She betrays.

25:23.480 --> 25:25.608
She'll do anything to survive.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.970
Nadia...

25:30.520 --> 25:32.045
NO, I'm...

25:32.600 --> 25:34.443
I'm right here.

25:34.960 --> 25:38.806
Nadia, look at me. Look at me.
I'm here. I'm right here.

25:42.120 --> 25:44.009
I'm looking for my mother.

25:52.120 --> 25:55.329
This is not what your
life should have been.

25:56.120 --> 25:57.531
Five hundred years...

25:59.520 --> 26:02.524
searching for a mother who ended up...

26:04.640 --> 26:06.369
being me.

26:18.080 --> 26:20.845
Let me show you
what your life should have been.

26:21.360 --> 26:23.010
What your perfect day...

26:24.560 --> 26:26.562
would have been like.

26:30.520 --> 26:32.887
You and I had a little cottage.

26:33.360 --> 26:35.761
<i>It was an ordinary summer day.</i>

26:36.000 --> 26:38.002
<i>You'd been playing outside...</i>

26:38.240 --> 26:41.050
<i>so you were tired, and
it was time for bed.</i>

26:41.360 --> 26:44.204
<i>You told me about the
fort that you'd built...</i>

26:44.560 --> 26:47.211
<i>out in the woods by the river...</i>

26:47.360 --> 26:50.045
<i>and so I asked if I could visit.</i>

26:51.480 --> 26:54.609
<i>You said when the sun
came up in the morning.</i>

26:57.520 --> 26:59.488
"Good night, Nadia.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.804
Sleep well.

27:27.400 --> 27:30.449
Your mother loves you."

29:01.520 --> 29:03.568
Ah, so.

29:07.480 --> 29:08.686
This is it.

29:16.320 --> 29:19.881
Hello, Katherine.
You didn't think I'd miss this, did you?

29:32.400 --> 29:33.526
Okay.

29:34.360 --> 29:37.603
So who's got the knife?

29:38.600 --> 29:40.329
Which one of you is gonna get...

29:40.680 --> 29:44.765
to kill the elusive Katherine Pierce
once and for all?

29:50.160 --> 29:51.207
What?

29:51.400 --> 29:53.767
Suddenly everyone's speechless?

29:55.040 --> 29:58.522
When I was on my deathbed
you all had plenty to say.

29:59.720 --> 30:02.644
Is it you? Tyler?

30:02.840 --> 30:04.888
Because I triggered the werewolf curse?

30:05.120 --> 30:07.646
Gave you an identity, and made you matter?

30:08.040 --> 30:09.565
You've done nothing for me.

30:09.760 --> 30:13.207
Oh, please, Tyler. lf l hadn't
walked into your life, you'd just be...

30:13.400 --> 30:17.200
a wasted nobody with a boozy mom
and a temper problem.

30:18.360 --> 30:19.646
Hey, don't, don't.

30:20.960 --> 30:22.041
And you.

30:22.240 --> 30:24.242
I'm not worried about you offing me.

30:24.440 --> 30:27.410
Because we both know I made you better
by making you a vampire.

30:29.240 --> 30:30.685
Goodbye, Katherine.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.411
Bye-bye, Caroline.

30:35.400 --> 30:39.610
The one girl here who actually appreciates
how beautiful you are.

30:39.760 --> 30:42.604
You'd wouldn't stab me
in the heart, would you?

30:43.240 --> 30:44.730
No, I don't think so.

30:45.040 --> 30:48.886
You will definitely go down
as the best night I never had.

30:50.320 --> 30:52.209
- Oh, Well.
- Oh, Well.

30:55.720 --> 30:56.881
Well, little Gilbert...

30:58.400 --> 31:01.449
it was nice to have a brother
for a second there.

31:01.600 --> 31:03.568
When you weren't being so damn annoying.

31:05.800 --> 31:09.725
Bon Bon, no need for goodbyes.
I'll see you on the flip side.

31:14.640 --> 31:15.721
Damon.

31:16.080 --> 31:18.287
Oh, how you would love nothing more...

31:18.440 --> 31:21.523
than to drive that
blade right through me.

31:21.760 --> 31:24.604
We've already done this, Kitty Kat.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.445
I've said all I needed to say.

31:26.640 --> 31:31.248
I know, but I never got to say
what I needed to say to you.

31:32.800 --> 31:33.961
I'm sorry.

31:36.960 --> 31:40.009
You blame me for who you are.

31:41.720 --> 31:43.006
And I'm sorry.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.527
I'm sorry that I turned you.

31:46.760 --> 31:49.843
I'm sorry that you didn't get to die...

31:50.000 --> 31:53.163
as a forgotten nobody
on a bloody battlefield...

31:53.360 --> 31:57.445
and that your father didn't get to live
another day to be disgraced by you.

31:57.680 --> 32:00.001
Damon, I'm sorry
that I gave your life purpose.

32:00.240 --> 32:03.483
Passion. Drive. Desire.

32:03.840 --> 32:06.571
I'm sorry that you are who you are...

32:07.240 --> 32:09.811
because I'm the one
that taught you how to love.

32:11.960 --> 32:14.042
I'll see you in hell, Katherine.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.281
<i>Ste'? an .</i>

32:24.680 --> 32:27.081
You know, I always wondered
what it would be like...

32:27.320 --> 32:28.890
to be loved by you.

32:29.040 --> 32:30.804
You've got to admit...

32:31.400 --> 32:34.051
for that one fleeting moment...

32:35.400 --> 32:37.084
your feelings were real.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.886
This has truly been the role of a lifetime.

32:46.680 --> 32:48.444
Stefan, I love you.

32:48.880 --> 32:51.087
I've always loved you.

33:09.920 --> 33:12.127
Then I guess this is how...

33:13.760 --> 33:15.444
our love story ends.

34:21.320 --> 34:24.290
Stefan said we should bury her
in the woods.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.168
Screw that.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.002
She deserves better.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.364
You need some help?

34:41.480 --> 34:42.811
No.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.286
I got this.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.525
Why is she not waking up?

34:53.880 --> 34:56.850
When Gregor left Matt's body
it took him a while to wake up too.

34:59.120 --> 35:03.011
Which gives us a little bit of time
to talk about what the hell you did.

35:03.280 --> 35:07.205
Relax. Thanks to Tyler's friendly donation,
I'll be fine for a couple hours.

35:09.160 --> 35:11.208
A few hours, huh?

35:12.040 --> 35:13.201
And then what?

35:13.520 --> 35:15.363
What's the plan?

35:16.480 --> 35:18.209
Tell her everything I did.

35:18.520 --> 35:21.967
Let the chips crash and burn
where they may.

35:24.520 --> 35:25.726
Optimistic.

35:26.040 --> 35:28.281
I don't wanna be another Katherine Pierce.

35:29.560 --> 35:33.531
Katherine spent her whole life
running from her problems only to die here.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.571
Old and alone.

35:42.040 --> 35:44.407
Is it wrong that I feel...?

35:44.960 --> 35:46.246
Victorious?

35:47.080 --> 35:48.161
Sad.

35:49.640 --> 35:54.009
I know that Katherine
is a horrible person, but... Mm.

35:54.640 --> 35:57.086
But you see the good in people.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.247
You mean Klaus.

36:02.560 --> 36:05.086
Because I saw the good in Klaus.

36:05.240 --> 36:08.084
Your words. Not mine.

36:10.600 --> 36:14.571
Your hybrid bite just killed someone
and no one even batted an eye.

36:14.760 --> 36:18.765
I sleep with the wrong guy weeks ago and I
don't hear the end of it. How is that fair?

36:19.000 --> 36:22.288
I don't know, Care. Maybe people
just expect more from you.

36:22.480 --> 36:26.041
Why? Because being good
comes so easy to me?

36:26.280 --> 36:28.009
Well, guess what, Tyler. It doesn't.

36:28.240 --> 36:31.130
I am a vampire.
I have the same impulses as you.

36:31.360 --> 36:35.285
So I'm allowed to make some mistakes
along the way. Yes, I slept with Klaus.

36:35.480 --> 36:39.724
But after you walked away from me. That
was my choice, and I am living with it.

36:39.960 --> 36:42.611
And I don't need to be
hearing about it every five seconds.

36:42.880 --> 36:46.646
So just get over it, or
get out of my life...

36:48.520 --> 36:50.727
but I'm done feeling guilty.

37:21.160 --> 37:22.844
This is for you, Dad.

37:28.160 --> 37:30.322
I want you to know how much I miss you.

37:37.520 --> 37:39.568
You've gotta be kidding me, right?

37:41.120 --> 37:44.522
Something tells me
I'm about five centuries delayed...

37:44.680 --> 37:47.331
on the whole
believing in a higher power thing.

37:47.520 --> 37:50.364
Well, you're here. That means it worked.

37:51.520 --> 37:52.567
You're dead.

37:52.960 --> 37:54.200
True.

37:54.600 --> 37:58.571
Then again, your friends didn't really
give me much of a choice in the matter.

37:59.880 --> 38:03.805
Using my only daughter against me? Harsh.

38:04.160 --> 38:06.367
I suppose I could've spent the next...

38:06.560 --> 38:08.722
500 years running.

38:08.880 --> 38:11.451
But for what? Heh.

38:11.640 --> 38:13.881
My daughter was dying.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.646
Stefan would never love me.

38:16.880 --> 38:19.850
I was back to having nothing.

38:20.040 --> 38:21.724
And Elena wins again.

38:21.960 --> 38:23.166
Let's get this over with.

38:23.400 --> 38:26.006
I'm really starting to get sick of Elena...

38:26.240 --> 38:28.049
getting everything that I want.

38:28.680 --> 38:30.728
What is that supposed to mean?

38:30.960 --> 38:33.406
Wes had no intention...

38:33.600 --> 38:34.886
of helping Nadia.

38:35.480 --> 38:38.563
<i>STEFAN'. You can always run, Katherine.
It's your choice.</i>

38:38.720 --> 38:40.245
Damn it.

38:47.040 --> 38:48.246
<i>A good</i> day.

38:48.560 --> 38:52.246
<i>I've managed to extract the werewolf venom
from Nadia Petrova's blood.</i>

38:52.480 --> 38:56.883
<i>The addition of the venom will make the
Ripper virus even more lethal to vampires.</i>

38:57.080 --> 39:00.766
<i>He was just using her
as</i> a <i>case study in his project...</i>

39:01.000 --> 39:03.162
to wipe vampires off
the face of the Earth.

39:03.640 --> 39:04.926
Why are you telling me this?

39:06.280 --> 39:07.725
Mm.

39:08.280 --> 39:09.645
Hi.

39:10.120 --> 39:11.451
Elena?

39:11.640 --> 39:13.841
I've said it before, and I'll say it again.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.651
Elena had the life I always wanted.

39:17.560 --> 39:18.607
Well...

39:18.760 --> 39:20.967
- ...until now.
- Katherine, what did you do?

39:21.200 --> 39:24.249
Stefan thought he gave me a choice:

39:24.440 --> 39:25.646
Run...

39:25.880 --> 39:29.805
<i>or die. But that's not
really much of a choice, is it?</i>

39:30.800 --> 39:32.290
<i>After all...</i>

39:32.440 --> 39:34.169
<i>Nadia was the only person...</i>

39:34.600 --> 39:37.604
<i>in this world who really loved me.</i>

39:37.800 --> 39:40.804
<i>And I wasn't about to let
my daughter die alone.</i>

39:42.680 --> 39:44.682
But Katherine Pierce...

39:44.880 --> 39:47.724
wasn't about to go gentle either.

39:52.800 --> 39:54.211
Mm.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.086
Hi.

39:59.320 --> 40:01.687
Are you you?

40:04.800 --> 40:06.325
Yeah.

40:07.800 --> 40:09.609
Yeah, it's me.

40:10.800 --> 40:11.847
I'm here.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.931
<i>I left Elena with</i> a
<i>little bit of</i> a <i>parting gift.</i>

40:25.480 --> 40:27.642
If I can't have Stefan...

40:28.240 --> 40:29.605
then no one can.

40:32.520 --> 40:34.010
Okay.

40:34.440 --> 40:36.249
Now I'm ready.

40:51.040 --> 40:55.364
- Nothing's happening. What's wrong?
- I don't know. This has never happened before.

40:58.360 --> 41:00.886
Bonnie, what are you doing?
Let me pass through.

41:01.360 --> 41:03.010
Why won't you let me pass through?

41:03.200 --> 41:06.010
I don't know. I don't control it.

41:06.200 --> 41:07.884
- What?
- It's not up to me.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.402
Then who is it up to?

41:28.400 --> 41:31.290
- Bonnie?
- I can't help you, Katherine.

41:32.080 --> 41:34.481
What? No, no, no.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.366
No!
