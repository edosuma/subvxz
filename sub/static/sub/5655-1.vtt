19:36.441 --> 19:37.441
I live inthe neighborhood.

19:37.442 --> 19:38.442
Me too.

19:38.443 --> 19:40.143
Oh, yeah, wabash and Ohio.

19:40.144 --> 19:41.445
The row of townhouses?

19:41.446 --> 19:43.113
I'm right at the endof the street, at the El.

19:43.114 --> 19:44.181
That's close.

19:44.182 --> 19:45.349
Nice to meet you, neighbor.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.818
Nice to meet you, too.

19:47.819 --> 19:49.987
We're not going to sitnext to each other, are we?

19:49.988 --> 19:51.888
Oh, no, no, no, that would be weird.

19:51.889 --> 19:52.990
A little.

19:52.991 --> 19:54.358
I'll just sitone row behind you,

19:54.359 --> 19:56.727
and, you know, hand you napkins.

19:56.728 --> 19:58.328
That's funny.

19:58.329 --> 20:01.499
♪ ♪

20:16.214 --> 20:17.181
Did you notice

20:17.182 --> 20:19.783
that I was the onlyman in there?

20:19.784 --> 20:21.018
Well, there was one other,

20:21.019 --> 20:22.419
but he had a flashlightand a broom.

20:23.355 --> 20:25.155
I'm picking the movienext time.

20:25.156 --> 20:26.857
Next time?

20:26.858 --> 20:28.125
Our second date.

20:28.126 --> 20:30.460
Wait, this wasn't a date.

20:30.461 --> 20:32.796
You sat a rowbehind me.

20:32.797 --> 20:33.997
I was meaning to talkto you about that.

20:33.998 --> 20:36.066
You have a freakishlylarge head.

20:36.067 --> 20:37.134
I do not.

20:37.135 --> 20:38.802
What hat size is that, is that, like, a jumbo?

20:38.803 --> 20:39.470
7 1/2.

20:39.471 --> 20:40.771
What are youtalking about?

20:40.772 --> 20:42.506
Now there's definitely notgoing to be a second date.

20:42.507 --> 20:45.409
Besides, I'm not dating.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.511
Boyfriend?

20:47.512 --> 20:48.879
Fiance.

20:48.880 --> 20:50.480
Ex.

20:50.481 --> 20:52.949
How ex?

20:52.950 --> 20:54.117
Yesterday.

20:55.253 --> 20:56.987
At least you've hadtime to get over it.

20:56.988 --> 20:58.155
Here's your cappuccino.

20:58.156 --> 21:00.457
One minute, we're picking outflower arrangements

21:00.458 --> 21:01.858
for our wedding,

21:01.859 --> 21:03.193
the next minute, he tells me

21:03.194 --> 21:05.762
that, you know, we've grown apart.

21:05.763 --> 21:07.297
Must have beensome toxic flowers.

21:07.298 --> 21:08.465
What are you drinking?

21:08.466 --> 21:10.834
I mean, uh...

21:10.835 --> 21:11.803
An ice-blended mocha.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.236
Ice-blended mocha.

21:13.237 --> 21:15.005
Yeah, he wanted meto drop everything

21:15.006 --> 21:17.474
so I'd be on his armat parties, and dinners,

21:17.475 --> 21:18.542
and south beach,

21:18.543 --> 21:20.243
and I had to change my hair, and my clothes,

21:20.244 --> 21:22.345
and live in someover-priced penthouse

21:22.346 --> 21:25.048
with the... you know, that was too big.

21:25.049 --> 21:26.249
Sounds like a jerk.

21:26.250 --> 21:28.051
Can I get one ofthose crullers, too, please?

21:28.052 --> 21:29.219
Crullers hereare amazing.

21:29.220 --> 21:31.822
I've done enough damagetoday, thanks.

21:31.823 --> 21:33.223
Thank you.

21:33.224 --> 21:35.225
Well, I thinkyou dodged a bullet.

21:35.226 --> 21:37.060
I should know, I've dodged many.

21:37.061 --> 21:38.895
I've even been grazed once.

21:38.896 --> 21:40.530
You survived.

21:40.531 --> 21:42.866
Yeah, I only think about heronce a year now.

21:42.867 --> 21:44.334
Aw. Valentine's day?

21:44.335 --> 21:46.069
Black Friday.

21:47.105 --> 21:48.338
I think I want a cruller.

21:48.339 --> 21:49.339
Yes.

21:49.340 --> 21:50.440
I'm going to needa cruller.

21:50.441 --> 21:51.475
Good choice.

21:51.476 --> 21:53.143
Yeah, all right, let me get this.

21:53.144 --> 21:54.144
My treat.

21:54.145 --> 21:55.479
-I insist.-No.

21:55.480 --> 21:56.913
Don't make a big thingout of it.

21:56.914 --> 21:58.281
You're the one that's makinga big thing out of it.

21:58.282 --> 22:00.250
What is this, like a power thing?

22:00.251 --> 22:01.418
Well, yeah.

22:01.419 --> 22:02.452
You buy me coffee,

22:02.453 --> 22:03.887
the next thing you know, I'm indebted to you.

22:03.888 --> 22:04.988
You've got to be kidding me.

22:04.989 --> 22:06.389
It's just coffee.

22:06.390 --> 22:07.358
It's not just coffee.

22:07.359 --> 22:09.125
Coffee is never just coffee.

22:09.126 --> 22:10.260
Right? It becomes drinks,

22:10.261 --> 22:11.261
then it becomes dinner, and dates,

22:11.262 --> 22:13.096
and the next thing you know,

22:13.097 --> 22:14.197
you're trying to take overmy entire life.

22:14.198 --> 22:15.499
Thanks.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.134
Okay, you know what, you want to pay, pay.

22:17.135 --> 22:19.269
While you're at it, why don't you pay for this?

22:19.270 --> 22:20.403
And, uh...

22:20.404 --> 22:21.605
Here's my dry cleaning bill, you could pay for that...

22:21.606 --> 22:22.839
You thinkthis is funny?

22:22.840 --> 22:23.574
Yeah, I do, kind of.

22:23.575 --> 22:25.308
It's not funny to me.

22:25.309 --> 22:27.144
Tell you what, we'll split it.

22:27.145 --> 22:30.013
That way, you don'thave to feel indebted to me,

22:30.014 --> 22:31.214
and I don't have to be, uh...

22:31.215 --> 22:32.315
What?

22:32.316 --> 22:33.850
-Nothing.-say it.

22:33.851 --> 22:35.418
Emasculated.

22:35.419 --> 22:36.419
Like your fiance.

22:36.420 --> 22:38.489
Ex-fiance.

22:40.591 --> 22:41.992
Keep the change.

22:41.993 --> 22:43.927
Thank you.

22:43.928 --> 22:45.362
And I'm sorry I let yousit behind me!

22:45.363 --> 22:48.164
Yeah, you and me both.Unbelievable.

22:48.165 --> 22:49.599
Our Twitter is blowing up.

22:49.600 --> 22:50.901
You're trending.

22:50.902 --> 22:51.869
What?

22:51.870 --> 22:53.537
"Dumpedon the radio girl"?

22:53.538 --> 22:55.505
Hashtag excruciating?

22:55.506 --> 22:57.207
-Great.-it is.

22:57.208 --> 22:58.208
You're gettingmore publicity

22:58.209 --> 22:59.509
than Dr. Lynne ever did.

22:59.510 --> 23:01.077
It's awesome.

23:01.078 --> 23:02.479
So, I went to the movies

23:02.480 --> 23:03.414
this afternoon

23:03.415 --> 23:04.415
to get some popcorn,

23:04.416 --> 23:06.049
and I met this bereft woman,

23:06.050 --> 23:08.251
who had been dumped by her fiance,

23:08.252 --> 23:10.287
and I gotta admit my heart went out to her

23:10.288 --> 23:11.555
for a minute.

23:11.556 --> 23:14.357
Apparently, I have found the way

23:14.358 --> 23:16.459
to get the woman to pay for the date.

23:16.460 --> 23:17.527
Just offer to get it.

23:17.528 --> 23:18.628
She'll get all defensive

23:18.629 --> 23:20.630
and want to payfor the check herself.

23:20.631 --> 23:22.165
I was not defensive!

23:22.166 --> 23:25.235
Guys, why do we insiston getting engaged to someone

23:25.236 --> 23:27.604
we know we don't want to marry?

23:27.605 --> 23:29.940
Is there not a way to say no

23:29.941 --> 23:31.241
before we get to the florist?

23:31.242 --> 23:32.943
You!

23:32.944 --> 23:33.944
What? Uh...

23:33.945 --> 23:35.278
I know you.

23:35.279 --> 23:36.414
What is happening here?

23:38.649 --> 23:40.216
Sonia?

23:40.217 --> 23:42.352
You're Nick lyndon?

23:42.353 --> 23:44.354
That would be me, on air, doing a show.

23:44.355 --> 23:45.622
You mean telling yourcave-dwelling listeners

23:45.623 --> 23:47.257
about me.

23:47.258 --> 23:48.892
Listeners, I believewe have a stalker

23:48.893 --> 23:49.960
live in the studio.

23:49.961 --> 23:51.161
What makes you thinki would stalk you?

23:51.162 --> 23:53.196
You're in my studio?

23:53.197 --> 23:54.197
Ever heard ofthe Dr. Lynne show?

23:54.198 --> 23:55.532
I'm not the onewho needs therapy.

23:55.533 --> 23:57.033
No, no, no, Nick, she's subbing for Dr. Lynne.

23:57.034 --> 23:58.034
What?

23:58.035 --> 24:00.003
I'm subbing for Dr. Lynne.

24:00.004 --> 24:02.038
We're gonna takea short break.

24:02.039 --> 24:03.039
This is Nick's man cave.

24:03.040 --> 24:04.908
You're listening towcv talk radio,

24:04.909 --> 24:06.042
and we'll be back

24:06.043 --> 24:08.111
after we sell you some... stuff.

24:08.112 --> 24:10.413
No, no, this is gold.

24:10.414 --> 24:11.414
I was lookingto buy some popcorn.

24:11.415 --> 24:12.383
At my theater.

24:12.384 --> 24:13.416
Your theater?

24:13.417 --> 24:14.417
What gives you the right

24:14.418 --> 24:15.418
to talk to your listenersabout me?

24:15.419 --> 24:16.453
It's my show,

24:16.454 --> 24:17.654
I can pretty much talk aboutanything I want.

24:17.655 --> 24:18.655
Then you won't mind

24:18.656 --> 24:19.656
if I talk to my listenersabout you.

24:19.657 --> 24:21.124
I've got nothing to hide.

24:21.125 --> 24:22.158
Black Friday?

24:22.159 --> 24:23.960
Audrey hepburnnever got married, did she?

24:23.961 --> 24:25.562
That's Katharine hepburn.

24:25.563 --> 24:26.663
Who cares.

24:26.664 --> 24:27.565
I couldn't see herbecause of your giant head.

24:27.566 --> 24:29.199
My head's biggerthan your future.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.567
No wonder

24:30.568 --> 24:31.635
your fiance left you.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.703
Nick was burnedby a woman,

24:33.704 --> 24:36.239
so he creates a showcalled "the man cave"

24:36.240 --> 24:37.407
where he gives terrible advice

24:37.408 --> 24:39.209
to unsuspecting men

24:39.210 --> 24:42.078
about how they should avoidrelationships and commitment,

24:42.079 --> 24:44.614
all from the safetyof his glass-enclosed booth.

24:44.615 --> 24:46.149
I think we're done here.

24:46.150 --> 24:47.717
Oh, we areso done here.

24:47.718 --> 24:52.356
So completelyand irrevocably done.

25:04.602 --> 25:05.603
Sonia, come in.

25:13.577 --> 25:15.011
Brad, thank you so much for...

25:15.012 --> 25:16.012
Why is he here?

25:16.013 --> 25:17.414
Brad asked me infor a meeting.

25:17.415 --> 25:18.548
Yes, I did.

25:18.549 --> 25:19.549
I can wait outside.I'll...

25:19.550 --> 25:20.583
No, you are the meeting.

25:20.584 --> 25:21.519
Why?

25:21.520 --> 25:22.652
Who walks inwhen someone's on the air

25:22.653 --> 25:23.753
and starts yelling at them?

25:23.754 --> 25:25.088
I'm sorryabout that...

25:25.089 --> 25:26.289
And you, you've beeninterested in morning hours...

25:26.290 --> 25:27.290
Yeah, I've been...

25:27.291 --> 25:28.291
The show justwent viral.

25:28.292 --> 25:29.492
The owner of the stationjust called...

25:29.493 --> 25:30.694
Look, I apologize...

25:30.695 --> 25:32.429
...loving it.

25:32.430 --> 25:33.530
So, you're going to getthe new time slot

25:33.531 --> 25:34.564
that you want,

25:34.565 --> 25:35.665
because I'm puttingthe two of you together

25:35.666 --> 25:36.634
on the morning show.

25:36.635 --> 25:37.635
Oh, no.

25:37.636 --> 25:38.636
Oh, yes.

25:38.637 --> 25:39.637
And if the attentionthat you've gotten

25:39.638 --> 25:40.638
is any indication,

25:40.639 --> 25:42.639
you two are going to beworking together

25:42.640 --> 25:45.108
for the rest of your lives.

25:45.109 --> 25:46.710
Okay, well, hear me out.

25:46.711 --> 25:50.380
So, what is the worstthing in radio, hmm?

25:50.381 --> 25:51.248
Come on.

25:51.249 --> 25:52.582
Dead air.

25:52.583 --> 25:56.052
Now, with you and man cave, we will not have that problem.

25:56.053 --> 25:58.455
Oh, hey, sir, can I have another one, please?

25:58.456 --> 25:59.723
Keep them coming.

25:59.724 --> 26:01.424
Sonia, it's not that bad.

26:01.425 --> 26:02.293
It's not the end of the world.

26:02.294 --> 26:04.060
When I gave Scott back his ring,

26:04.061 --> 26:06.229
I told him I was going toflourish without him.

26:06.230 --> 26:07.430
Quitting my job

26:07.431 --> 26:10.066
does not exactly encompasswhat I set out to do.

26:10.067 --> 26:11.201
Okay, so don't quit.

26:11.202 --> 26:12.136
I can't spend all day,

26:12.137 --> 26:13.137
every day,

26:13.138 --> 26:15.238
trapped in a roomwith that barbarian.

26:15.239 --> 26:16.740
Yes, you can,

26:16.741 --> 26:18.708
because bradis letting me produce,

26:18.709 --> 26:20.143
and you knowmore than anyone

26:20.144 --> 26:21.211
how badlyI've been wanting

26:21.212 --> 26:22.412
to do a morning show.

26:22.413 --> 26:25.115
-There you go, ladies.-Thank you.

26:25.116 --> 26:26.182
Oh, no, I'm not done.

26:26.183 --> 26:27.384
Besides,

26:27.385 --> 26:29.453
you've alreadybeen publicly humiliated.

26:30.421 --> 26:31.688
You've got nothing to lose.

26:31.689 --> 26:32.722
Sir?

26:32.723 --> 26:34.424
Is there any wayto make these stronger?

26:34.425 --> 26:36.726
She just sabotagedmy whole career.

26:36.727 --> 26:38.027
I've been doingthat show for years,

26:38.028 --> 26:40.029
and she comes in, and, in one day, she ruins it.

26:40.030 --> 26:41.397
I don't even knowwhy was I nice to her.

26:41.398 --> 26:43.233
Because you werehitting on her?

26:43.234 --> 26:44.667
Well, I should have beenhitting my face

26:44.668 --> 26:46.069
against a brick.

26:46.070 --> 26:47.370
I'll call.

26:49.540 --> 26:51.508
She should be kissingthe ground I walk on.

26:51.509 --> 26:54.244
I handed herthe pinnacle of radio,

26:54.245 --> 26:56.279
a morning show in oneof the biggest markets.

26:56.280 --> 26:58.782
She's been at wcv forall of what, five minutes?

27:01.252 --> 27:02.519
You're laughing?

27:02.520 --> 27:03.620
I'm sorry, I've just never seen you

27:03.621 --> 27:06.189
get you so riled up before.

27:06.190 --> 27:07.091
Well...

27:07.092 --> 27:08.658
Maybe once.

27:08.659 --> 27:09.793
So, is the man cave goneor what?

27:09.794 --> 27:10.728
How should I know?

27:10.729 --> 27:12.529
This is all news to me.

27:12.530 --> 27:15.231
Well, I, for one, will be celebrating,

27:15.232 --> 27:17.100
because your showwas despicable.

27:17.101 --> 27:17.768
Thank you, sis.

27:17.769 --> 27:19.335
Well, it was.

27:19.336 --> 27:20.370
Well, I liked it,

27:20.371 --> 27:21.738
although yourrelationship advice

27:21.739 --> 27:23.540
didn't really work outtoo well for me.

27:23.541 --> 27:24.508
Yet.

27:24.509 --> 27:26.609
And it won't.

27:26.610 --> 27:29.245
All I know is, I gotta get rid of her.

27:29.246 --> 27:30.513
You know, the worst thing on radio

27:30.514 --> 27:31.682
is not dead air.

27:34.251 --> 27:36.320
It's him.

27:46.564 --> 27:47.764
Nick?

27:47.765 --> 27:49.299
Hi. Amanda lazaro.

27:49.300 --> 27:50.333
I'm a huge fan.

27:50.334 --> 27:51.701
-Really?-yeah.

27:51.702 --> 27:53.169
Why?

27:53.170 --> 27:55.238
Well, not that I necessarilyagree with everything you say,

27:55.239 --> 27:56.539
but I, uh, I like your style.

27:56.540 --> 27:57.707
Well, thank you.

27:57.708 --> 27:59.509
You, uh, you dothe cooking show?

27:59.510 --> 28:00.743
Lifestyle.

28:00.744 --> 28:01.712
Although I do cook.

28:01.713 --> 28:03.580
Well, that's a coincidence.I eat.

28:03.581 --> 28:05.248
Oh, well, lucky me.

28:06.350 --> 28:08.852
I also happen to havemy reel with me.

28:08.853 --> 28:09.753
Between you and me,

28:09.754 --> 28:11.754
I am really hopingto get into TV,

28:11.755 --> 28:12.889
so if you happento know anyone...

28:12.890 --> 28:14.557
Unfortunately, all the people I know

28:14.558 --> 28:16.125
are basically useless.

28:16.126 --> 28:17.427
Keep it.You never know.

28:17.428 --> 28:19.329
And when you show uptomorrow, show up hungry.

28:19.330 --> 28:21.631
I'm on right after you, and I always have food.

28:21.632 --> 28:23.299
Okay.

28:23.300 --> 28:24.567
This morning gighas some perks.

28:24.568 --> 28:25.902
And I spoke too soon.

28:25.903 --> 28:27.136
Sonia! Amanda lazaro, big fan.

28:27.137 --> 28:28.204
Hi!

28:28.205 --> 28:30.673
The chemistrybetween you two...

28:30.674 --> 28:31.674
Flawless.

28:31.675 --> 28:32.675
Knock 'em dead.

28:32.676 --> 28:34.377
Thank you.

28:34.378 --> 28:35.712
I say, just have fun.

28:35.713 --> 28:37.146
Love is drama.

28:37.147 --> 28:39.249
Love has the powerto break your heart

28:39.250 --> 28:40.750
and make you sick.

28:40.751 --> 28:42.285
-Who needs that?-That's not love.

28:42.286 --> 28:43.553
That's a country western song.

28:43.554 --> 28:46.356
You can be in loveand not get lost in it.

28:46.357 --> 28:47.423
Clearly, you'venever been in love.

28:47.424 --> 28:48.424
Excuse me?

28:48.425 --> 28:49.626
Guys, when a womansays, "excuse me?"

28:49.627 --> 28:51.427
It's not becauseshe didn't hear you.

28:51.428 --> 28:54.364
She's giving you a chanceto change what you just said.

28:54.365 --> 28:55.565
Well, excuse me while I gag.

28:55.566 --> 28:57.700
A reaction I'm sure you'requite used to from women.

28:57.701 --> 28:59.402
Actually, other than you, women seem to like me.

28:59.403 --> 29:00.770
-They're just being polite.-No, they like me.

29:00.771 --> 29:01.771
We're talkingabout here,

29:01.772 --> 29:03.172
on planet earth?

29:03.173 --> 29:04.241
Come on, you really don'tfind me a little bit attractive?

29:07.478 --> 29:08.445
No.

29:08.446 --> 29:09.913
But then, I have a brain.

29:09.914 --> 29:11.180
That's right, we know,

29:11.181 --> 29:12.649
you're smart, you're independent.

29:12.650 --> 29:14.284
You're an island.The question is,

29:14.285 --> 29:15.618
does anyone want to inhabitthat island?

29:15.619 --> 29:18.421
A lot sooner than they wantto visit Nick's man cave,

29:18.422 --> 29:19.390
that's for sure.

29:19.391 --> 29:20.391
You're wrong.

29:20.392 --> 29:21.392
I don't think that I am.

29:21.393 --> 29:22.492
All right, I'll make you a bet.

29:22.493 --> 29:24.527
I can get more women to date methan you can men.

29:24.528 --> 29:25.795
You're on.

29:25.796 --> 29:27.764
Come check out the speed dating showdown.

29:27.765 --> 29:31.367
We'll bring the cameras... you decide.

29:31.368 --> 29:32.635
Love connection!

29:35.539 --> 29:38.741
So, where have you beenall my life, sweetie?

29:38.742 --> 29:40.743
Well, for a good partof the first part,

29:40.744 --> 29:42.211
I wasn't born yet.

29:43.314 --> 29:44.614
Cupid's arrow!

29:44.615 --> 29:45.782
Hey...

29:45.783 --> 29:46.750
Donna, how you doing?

29:46.751 --> 29:48.618
I'm a swimsuit model.

29:48.619 --> 29:49.520
I love swimming.

29:50.388 --> 29:51.621
Switcheroo!

29:51.622 --> 29:53.456
So, what do you do?

29:53.457 --> 29:55.358
Hey, aren't you that girlwho got dumped on the radio?

29:55.359 --> 29:57.527
Yes, but I'd prefer thatthat didn't define me.

29:57.528 --> 29:59.495
How embarrassing was that?

29:59.496 --> 30:01.264
I'll bet you're stillreliving it, huh?

30:01.265 --> 30:02.298
Yeah.

30:03.201 --> 30:04.467
Karmic connection.

30:04.468 --> 30:07.670
Nick, I am a huge fanof your show.

30:07.671 --> 30:08.838
I'm a huge fan of your show.

30:08.839 --> 30:09.906
But I don't have a show.

30:09.907 --> 30:10.808
You should.

30:13.410 --> 30:14.744
Oh, my goodness.

30:14.745 --> 30:16.212
You are too much, Nick!

30:16.213 --> 30:17.780
You're going to make me cry.

30:17.781 --> 30:19.515
Love spell.

30:19.516 --> 30:21.485
Hi. Tell me about yourself.

30:24.221 --> 30:25.255
She left me.

30:26.423 --> 30:27.757
Did you try to talk to herabout it?

30:27.758 --> 30:29.892
I tried! She just...

30:29.893 --> 30:32.895
She saidit wasn't gonna work, and...

30:34.365 --> 30:35.632
Intermingle.

30:35.633 --> 30:36.799
Where'd you go to school?

30:36.800 --> 30:38.301
I went tothe university of Chicago.

30:38.302 --> 30:39.736
-Me too.-Oh, great.

30:39.737 --> 30:40.737
What was your major?

30:40.738 --> 30:42.239
-Women's studies.-Oh.

30:43.240 --> 30:44.340
You're one of those.

30:44.341 --> 30:46.509
One of, um, what?

30:46.510 --> 30:47.744
You know, a feminist.

30:47.745 --> 30:49.245
If you mean by "feminist," you mean someone

30:49.246 --> 30:51.547
who actually believesthat women are people, too,

30:51.548 --> 30:53.282
then, yes, I am.

30:53.283 --> 30:54.417
-You?-um...

30:54.418 --> 30:56.452
...i smell love.

30:58.622 --> 30:59.822
My turn.

30:59.823 --> 31:01.290
This just keepsgetting better.

31:01.291 --> 31:03.860
I'd pull your chair out for you, but they don't do that here.

31:03.861 --> 31:04.861
You must love that.

31:04.862 --> 31:06.329
Well, Nick,

31:06.330 --> 31:07.497
why don't youtell me your interests?

31:07.498 --> 31:08.498
Oh, wait, no, let me guess.

31:08.499 --> 31:09.565
Popcorn,

31:09.566 --> 31:10.867
avoiding intimacy,

31:10.868 --> 31:12.969
and the habitsof prehistoric man?

31:12.970 --> 31:14.837
My interests aremy family, my show

31:14.838 --> 31:15.838
and my dog.

31:15.839 --> 31:17.340
You have a dog?

31:17.341 --> 31:18.374
Doesn't that involve commitment?

31:18.375 --> 31:19.442
You can borrow him if you like.

31:19.443 --> 31:20.610
Might help youget a date,

31:20.611 --> 31:21.944
although you should probablylet him do the talking.

31:21.945 --> 31:23.880
So, just to get women, you bought a dog?

31:23.881 --> 31:25.048
I rescued him.

31:25.049 --> 31:26.716
He was abandoned.He was too big to feed.

31:26.717 --> 31:27.750
We get by

31:27.751 --> 31:28.985
as long as I only eatonce a day.

31:28.986 --> 31:31.055
That's actually really nice.

31:33.524 --> 31:34.491
What?

31:34.491 --> 31:35.426
You're startingto like me a little bit.

31:35.427 --> 31:37.026
The abandoned dog thingalways works.

31:39.363 --> 31:41.064
People! People, shh!

31:41.065 --> 31:43.433
Listen up!

31:43.434 --> 31:44.867
You're receivingyour profiles.

31:44.868 --> 31:47.603
The individuals who wereequally interested in you

31:47.604 --> 31:50.006
will now have your numberand you theirs,

31:50.007 --> 31:52.776
so contact themfor whatever comes next.

31:55.279 --> 31:56.279
What?

31:56.280 --> 31:58.047
Ooh, donut.

31:58.048 --> 31:59.950
That hurts.

32:01.518 --> 32:03.420
This is ridiculous.

32:11.695 --> 32:13.362
Hey...

32:13.363 --> 32:14.797
Where are you going?

32:14.798 --> 32:16.532
Home.

32:16.533 --> 32:17.667
-Aw...-i may never come out.

32:19.303 --> 32:20.336
If it makes youfeel any better,

32:20.337 --> 32:21.838
I'll give you my number.

32:21.839 --> 32:23.306
You know, none of these guys

32:23.307 --> 32:25.808
were interested in hearinganything I had to say.

32:25.809 --> 32:26.743
Well, they mighthave been

32:26.744 --> 32:28.811
if you didn'tput up a fence.

32:28.812 --> 32:29.946
Not everyoneshows up to dates

32:29.947 --> 32:31.647
with wire cutters.

32:31.648 --> 32:35.084
Are you sayingi scare men?

32:35.085 --> 32:37.620
Well, you don't scare me.

32:37.621 --> 32:40.022
Then again, I hada really bossy sister.

32:41.859 --> 32:44.026
What are you doing?

32:44.027 --> 32:45.495
Losing these numbers

32:45.496 --> 32:47.663
in solidarity.

32:47.664 --> 32:48.865
Except for this one.

32:48.866 --> 32:49.966
The swimsuit model.

32:49.967 --> 32:51.602
Just in case.

33:06.683 --> 33:08.684
Hey, aren't you that girl that got dumped on the radio?

33:08.685 --> 33:09.752
And you can watch

33:09.753 --> 33:10.987
Sonia's colossal strikeout for all eternity

33:10.988 --> 33:12.455
on our website, ladies and gents.

33:12.456 --> 33:15.358
How embarrassing was that?

33:15.359 --> 33:17.760
I bet you're still reliving it, right?

33:20.597 --> 33:21.664
As you might have guessed,

33:21.665 --> 33:24.734
I won the speed datingcompetition yesterday.

33:24.735 --> 33:27.136
Oh, yeah, one step awayfrom the nobel prize.

33:27.137 --> 33:29.839
Shockingly, Sonia didn't geta single phone number,

33:29.840 --> 33:31.507
although I didoffer her mine.

33:31.508 --> 33:32.575
If I wanted your phone number,

33:32.576 --> 33:34.410
I could ask any womanon the street.

33:34.411 --> 33:36.412
You've given it outto half the female population.

33:36.413 --> 33:37.713
No, not half.

33:37.714 --> 33:39.148
-Maybe a fourth.-What is wrong with you?

33:39.149 --> 33:41.584
Why are youafraid of relationships?

33:41.585 --> 33:42.718
I think it's called being smart.

33:42.719 --> 33:44.887
Well, I think we should talkabout "black Friday."

33:44.888 --> 33:46.756
I'd rather talkabout your fiance.

33:46.757 --> 33:47.724
Ex-fiance.

33:47.725 --> 33:48.758
After all, it'sbecause of him

33:48.759 --> 33:49.693
I'm stuck with you.

33:49.693 --> 33:50.661
Well, the dooris right behind you.

33:50.661 --> 33:51.528
If you're leaving,

33:51.529 --> 33:52.562
I'll hold it openfor you.

33:52.563 --> 33:53.996
But that's the man's job.

33:53.997 --> 33:56.566
News flash, women can actually open doors.

33:56.567 --> 33:58.835
And there we have it, folks,

33:58.836 --> 34:00.570
you don't need a manfor anything...

34:00.571 --> 34:01.771
And withthat attitude,

34:01.772 --> 34:03.673
you will neverhave one either.

34:03.674 --> 34:05.608
There is no place for needin a relationship.

34:05.609 --> 34:06.609
And for the record,

34:06.610 --> 34:07.810
the reasonwe're not together

34:07.811 --> 34:09.911
is because he wanted my lifeto take a backseat to his.

34:09.913 --> 34:11.013
A backseat?

34:11.014 --> 34:11.915
Or did you just need togive him a little room

34:11.915 --> 34:12.850
in the front seat?

34:12.850 --> 34:13.850
When we met, we were equals,

34:13.851 --> 34:15.051
then all of a sudden, his career takes off,

34:15.052 --> 34:16.819
and he wanted me to besomeone I'm not.

34:16.820 --> 34:17.987
Supportive?

34:17.987 --> 34:18.987
No. What was I supposed to do,

34:18.989 --> 34:21.757
just drop everythingto be his plus one?

34:21.757 --> 34:23.092
Well, if you loved him,

34:23.092 --> 34:25.027
you could have made an effortto support his dreams as well.

34:25.027 --> 34:25.963
We've got toset up for commercial.

34:25.963 --> 34:26.897
Sorry, but I didn'tget the memo

34:26.898 --> 34:28.197
that says thatit's only the woman

34:28.197 --> 34:30.900
who's supposed to supportthe man's ambitions.

34:30.900 --> 34:32.568
And anyway, we weredating for five years,

34:32.569 --> 34:33.936
and he breaks upwith me

34:33.937 --> 34:36.472
with some lineabout "junctures"?

34:36.473 --> 34:37.907
Sorry, what?

34:37.908 --> 34:40.208
Yeah, he said that we wereat different junctures

34:40.210 --> 34:41.577
in our lives.

34:41.578 --> 34:42.879
What does that even mean?

34:44.648 --> 34:46.782
What does that mean, indeed.

34:46.783 --> 34:47.817
And on that note,

34:47.818 --> 34:49.552
we're going to goto a little break here.

34:49.553 --> 34:52.989
You're listening towcv, Chicago's talk radio,

34:52.989 --> 34:55.591
and we'll see you in five.

34:55.592 --> 34:56.993
That's priceless, guys.

34:56.994 --> 34:58.527
The phones are lit up like Christmas trees.

34:58.528 --> 34:59.896
That's what he said,

34:59.897 --> 35:01.564
those werehis exact words?

35:01.565 --> 35:04.734
Yeah, that's it.

35:06.436 --> 35:08.104
I've got totell you something.

35:08.105 --> 35:10.006
I think you'vesaid enough, don't you?

35:10.007 --> 35:11.507
No. No, no, no.

35:11.508 --> 35:13.442
I think your fiance mighthave broken up with you

35:13.443 --> 35:16.680
because he waslistening to me.

35:18.882 --> 35:23.687
No, I am pretty surethat listening to me did.

35:24.921 --> 35:25.923
I think you're right.

35:26.990 --> 35:29.792
I wasn't supportive enough.

35:29.793 --> 35:33.729
And I do put up fencesand scare off men.

35:33.730 --> 35:36.098
I mean, why else did I not geta single number from that event,

35:36.099 --> 35:39.902
not even from the guyon social security?

35:39.903 --> 35:41.470
Sorry, I just, I got lost

35:41.471 --> 35:43.073
right after you said, "you're right."

35:44.808 --> 35:46.676
No, look, you want to getthis Scott guy back?

35:46.677 --> 35:48.477
I don't know, it's too late, right?

35:48.478 --> 35:49.845
No, it's nevertoo late.

35:49.846 --> 35:50.846
He's a guy.

35:50.847 --> 35:51.847
We're like dogs.

35:51.848 --> 35:53.082
Just give us some foodand a chew toy

35:53.083 --> 35:54.150
and we're yours.

35:54.151 --> 35:56.553
And we're back fromcommercial in 10, guys.

35:58.121 --> 36:00.022
Did somebody break in?

36:00.023 --> 36:01.657
It's lived-in.

36:01.658 --> 36:03.192
Somehow, I was picturingsomething else.

36:03.193 --> 36:05.194
Like what, barbed wire?

36:05.195 --> 36:06.963
And a moat.

36:06.964 --> 36:08.864
So, tell meabout this Scott guy.

36:08.865 --> 36:10.199
Like what?

36:10.200 --> 36:13.002
Anything.what's he like?

36:13.003 --> 36:14.837
Well, he's a sports agent.

36:14.838 --> 36:16.572
He has lots of clients.

36:16.573 --> 36:18.107
He just signedthe blackhawks winger.

36:18.108 --> 36:19.642
Can you give me somethinga little more personal?

36:19.643 --> 36:21.544
He gets his hair cutevery six weeks.

36:21.545 --> 36:22.545
And...?

36:22.546 --> 36:23.846
And he likes roses.

36:23.847 --> 36:24.980
Red ones.

36:24.981 --> 36:26.015
You guys were togetherfor how long?

36:26.016 --> 36:27.284
Well, you'reputting me on the spot.

36:28.885 --> 36:31.053
Do you want somethingto drink or eat, or something?

36:31.054 --> 36:32.054
Yeah, sure.What have you got?

36:32.055 --> 36:34.890
Oh, I have no idea.

36:34.891 --> 36:36.593
I didn't think you'd say yes.

36:37.828 --> 36:39.095
I have mustard,

36:39.096 --> 36:41.297
and old take-out, and, uh, butter spray.

36:41.298 --> 36:42.531
Butter spray?

36:42.532 --> 36:43.833
It's good.

36:43.834 --> 36:44.867
How about this, where we can find Scott?

36:44.868 --> 36:46.669
On mondays and wednesdays, he goes to the gym,

36:46.670 --> 36:50.239
Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, he has drinks with clients.

36:50.240 --> 36:51.941
Saturdays and Sundays, he has games,

36:51.942 --> 36:52.909
and then drinks with clients.

36:52.910 --> 36:53.943
When did you guyssee each other?

36:53.944 --> 36:55.111
You know what, never mind.

36:55.112 --> 36:55.979
Let's go for Thursday,

36:55.980 --> 36:57.146
that gives us 48 hours.

36:57.147 --> 36:58.914
That's enough time to teachsign language to a chimp.

36:58.915 --> 37:00.616
Have you done this before?

37:00.617 --> 37:01.884
It's notrocket science.

37:01.885 --> 37:03.853
You want to get a guy back, you make him jealous.

37:03.854 --> 37:06.056
Now let's seethe clothes closet.

37:10.994 --> 37:12.294
You go toa lot of funerals?

37:12.295 --> 37:14.563
Well, I'd be happyto go to yours.

37:14.564 --> 37:17.066
No, I dress to betaken seriously.

37:17.067 --> 37:19.101
Do you know thatonly 17% of radio hosts

37:19.102 --> 37:20.003
are women?

37:20.004 --> 37:21.704
Do you knowthat sports agents

37:21.705 --> 37:23.606
are surroundedby beautiful women?

37:23.607 --> 37:25.674
Well, I met himbefore all of that,

37:25.675 --> 37:28.577
so I didn't have todress up for him.

37:28.578 --> 37:30.613
Well, you do now.

37:30.614 --> 37:31.381
What are you doing?

37:31.382 --> 37:32.848
What happened to the clothes?

37:32.849 --> 37:33.883
Leave him a message.

37:33.884 --> 37:35.251
Something simple and vague.

37:35.252 --> 37:37.086
Like, um...

37:37.087 --> 37:39.054
"I saw somethingthat reminded me of you."

37:39.055 --> 37:40.156
Why would I do that?

37:40.157 --> 37:41.957
'Cause he'll be curiousand he'll call you back.

37:41.958 --> 37:43.092
And when he does,

37:43.093 --> 37:44.860
under no circumstancesdo you answer.

37:44.861 --> 37:45.861
What if he doesn'tcall me back?

37:45.862 --> 37:47.330
He will.

37:49.599 --> 37:51.600
Hey, this is Scott. Please leave a message.

37:52.803 --> 37:56.072
Hey, Scott. It's Sonia.

37:56.073 --> 37:57.907
I saw somethingthat reminded me of you,

37:57.908 --> 37:58.908
and...

37:58.909 --> 37:59.876
It was the...

38:00.944 --> 38:05.048
Scissors that I usedto cut up your picture.

38:06.049 --> 38:08.350
♪ ♪

38:08.351 --> 38:10.286
That'll be $4.50.

38:10.287 --> 38:11.720
Thank you, sir.

38:11.721 --> 38:13.956
Thank you, ma'am.

38:13.957 --> 38:16.025
And here we are.

38:16.026 --> 38:18.661
I can't believe I'm letting youtake me shopping.

38:18.662 --> 38:20.362
I must havelost my mind.

38:20.363 --> 38:22.164
Well, a little trustis required.

38:22.165 --> 38:25.334
What, trust Mr. Man cave? Not likely.

38:25.335 --> 38:27.203
Nick! What are youdoing here?

38:27.204 --> 38:29.839
Sonia, this ismy sister, Julia.

38:29.840 --> 38:31.740
Wow, nice to meet you.

38:31.741 --> 38:33.709
Sonia, I love your show.

38:33.710 --> 38:34.810
Oh, thanks.

38:34.811 --> 38:36.178
It's "our show."

38:36.179 --> 38:38.080
No, I turn the sound downwhen you're on.

38:38.081 --> 38:39.615
She needs a dress.

38:39.616 --> 38:40.649
Help.

38:40.650 --> 38:41.951
I would love to.

38:41.952 --> 38:43.619
What's the occasion?

38:43.620 --> 38:45.321
Oh, well, I guess it'ssort of, what,

38:45.322 --> 38:46.689
a jealousy dress?

38:46.690 --> 38:48.324
I have just the thing.

38:48.325 --> 38:50.159
-You do?-Mm-hmm.

38:50.160 --> 38:51.894
Well, you havebeautiful clothes.

38:51.895 --> 38:53.362
Thank you!

38:53.363 --> 38:56.031
So, I am thinkingfor you...

38:56.032 --> 38:59.168
Short, red and sassy.

38:59.169 --> 39:00.970
I'm going to gograb a hot dog.

39:00.971 --> 39:01.972
It'll look great.

39:05.041 --> 39:08.177
I can't believeI'm taking advice from him.

39:08.178 --> 39:09.345
I know, it's scary.

39:09.346 --> 39:11.380
Well, I can't believehe brought you in here.

39:11.381 --> 39:12.681
He hasn't broughta woman in to meet me

39:12.682 --> 39:13.782
since his wife left him

39:13.783 --> 39:15.784
two years ago.

39:15.785 --> 39:16.852
Nick was married?

39:16.853 --> 39:19.088
He didn't tell you.

39:19.089 --> 39:20.656
Don't worry, my lips are sealed.

39:20.657 --> 39:21.757
Well, he was, uh,

39:21.758 --> 39:23.759
pretty crushed.

39:23.760 --> 39:26.096
That's when he started "the man cave."

39:28.832 --> 39:30.166
That's good, Robin, I think the hem's fine.

39:30.167 --> 39:31.167
But Sonia, look at this.

39:31.167 --> 39:32.035
I'm just going totake it up

39:32.036 --> 39:33.068
a bit here?

39:33.069 --> 39:34.037
Sure.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.038
Beautiful.

39:35.039 --> 39:37.840
It is beautiful.

39:37.841 --> 39:39.742
You want to betaken seriously?

39:39.743 --> 39:41.877
Look like that.

39:41.878 --> 39:43.946
An actual compliment.

39:43.947 --> 39:45.682
Thank you.

39:47.284 --> 39:50.920
Sonia, do you play poker?

39:50.921 --> 39:52.288
Haven't for a while.

39:52.289 --> 39:54.423
Well, we havean empty chair,

39:54.424 --> 39:56.325
don't we, Nick?

39:56.326 --> 39:57.693
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

39:57.694 --> 39:59.695
You should join us.

39:59.696 --> 40:02.464
Women just want youto be yourself, Liam.

40:02.465 --> 40:04.366
That's what I keeptelling him.

40:04.367 --> 40:05.768
Don't listento them.

40:05.769 --> 40:07.436
Bro, I've beenlistening to you,

40:07.437 --> 40:08.704
and all I've gotis a drink in my face

40:08.705 --> 40:09.905
and unanswered calls.

40:10.841 --> 40:12.408
Your old show was so good.

40:12.409 --> 40:14.410
Julia was telling meabout your old show

40:14.411 --> 40:15.378
before "the man cave."

40:15.379 --> 40:18.480
The old show got no ratings.

40:18.481 --> 40:20.749
What are you, like a card shark?

40:20.750 --> 40:22.184
My mother'sthird husband

40:22.185 --> 40:25.154
was a pit boss in Atlantic city.

40:25.155 --> 40:26.155
How many will you take?

40:26.156 --> 40:27.323
Just one?

40:27.324 --> 40:28.225
And it's card "sharp."

40:29.159 --> 40:30.359
No, I'm pretty sureit's "shark".

40:30.360 --> 40:33.362
Nope.how many do you need?

40:33.363 --> 40:37.733
Siri, what is a card "shark"?

40:37.734 --> 40:38.734
Okay, I found this

40:38.735 --> 40:39.735
on the web for "card shark..."

40:39.736 --> 40:40.869
Your "siri" is a man?

40:40.870 --> 40:42.938
I had the female version, but it had an attitude.

40:42.939 --> 40:44.306
Even your phoneis a chauvinist.

40:44.307 --> 40:45.741
Do you want cards or what?

40:45.742 --> 40:47.042
Sorry, I didn't get that.

40:47.043 --> 40:48.210
No, of course you didn't.

40:48.211 --> 40:49.845
Because you weren't listening, because you're a man.

40:49.846 --> 40:50.879
No, that's cool, you can insult him.

40:50.880 --> 40:52.181
He's not sensitive, like your siri.

40:52.182 --> 40:53.315
You don't even know my siri.

40:53.316 --> 40:55.018
Is she a woman? Then I know her.

41:00.123 --> 41:01.458
What?

41:12.135 --> 41:14.037
Amanda?

41:15.138 --> 41:16.839
And pancakes.

41:16.840 --> 41:17.840
Yeah!

41:17.841 --> 41:18.874
Well, Kale-cakes.

41:18.875 --> 41:20.009
With taro syrup.

41:20.878 --> 41:23.379
I'm taro and Kale intolerant.

41:23.380 --> 41:25.381
Oh, come on, just try it.

41:25.382 --> 41:26.349
Ready?

41:28.084 --> 41:29.251
Mm.

41:29.252 --> 41:30.886
Hmm? Very good.

41:31.756 --> 41:32.921
Don't forgetto burp him after.

41:32.922 --> 41:34.390
She just gets jealous

41:34.391 --> 41:35.924
when other womenpay attention to me.

41:35.925 --> 41:37.159
Sonia, do you want some?

41:37.160 --> 41:38.827
Oh, no, thank you, I'll pass.

41:38.828 --> 41:40.396
I do feeli should warn you,

41:40.397 --> 41:41.463
that our boy here

41:41.464 --> 41:42.765
has a two-weekmaximum limit

41:42.766 --> 41:43.766
on relationships.

41:43.767 --> 41:44.833
Don't you, Nick?

41:44.834 --> 41:46.769
Well, maybe he just hasn't metthe right girl.

41:46.770 --> 41:48.304
Hmm.

41:48.305 --> 41:49.805
More pancakes, please.

41:49.806 --> 41:50.840
Happily.

41:52.108 --> 41:53.309
Mm, so good.

41:53.310 --> 41:54.777
Is this an act,

41:54.778 --> 41:56.478
or do you two hate each other?

41:56.479 --> 41:58.414
I wouldn't say hate.

41:58.415 --> 42:00.149
A strong dislike.

42:00.150 --> 42:01.450
We're repulsedby each other.

42:01.451 --> 42:03.252
I'd agree with that.

42:03.253 --> 42:05.087
And that's allthe time we have.

42:05.088 --> 42:06.955
Until tomorrow, remember, guys,

42:06.956 --> 42:08.557
all options open.

42:08.558 --> 42:11.160
And ladies, men are an option,

42:11.161 --> 42:13.362
but stock optionsare more reliable.

42:13.363 --> 42:15.231
Good day, Chicago.

42:16.232 --> 42:17.299
Good show, guys.

42:17.300 --> 42:18.867
Uh, Nick, your squeeze with the big gams

42:18.868 --> 42:20.402
needs your attention.

42:20.403 --> 42:21.403
Thank you, Tanya.

42:21.404 --> 42:22.838
You're bringing themhere now?

42:22.839 --> 42:24.139
Yeah, you shouldcome meet her.

42:24.140 --> 42:26.508
Oh, no, thanks, I'll catch the next one.

42:26.509 --> 42:29.045
I don't know, this one's a keeper.

42:31.448 --> 42:32.382
Hello, buddy.

42:34.384 --> 42:35.451
Hi!

42:35.452 --> 42:37.252
Oh, look at you! Aw...

42:37.253 --> 42:38.854
You really do have a dog.

42:38.855 --> 42:39.855
Thank you.

42:39.856 --> 42:41.056
Aw, sweetheart!

42:41.057 --> 42:42.991
How could anyone give him up?

42:42.992 --> 42:44.827
Well, his kibble bill'sbigger than the national debt.

42:44.828 --> 42:46.562
And he needs a ton of exercise,

42:46.563 --> 42:47.930
which iswhere we're going right now.

42:47.931 --> 42:49.031
What?

42:49.032 --> 42:50.099
He likes you.

42:50.100 --> 42:51.134
Aw, it's mutual.

42:53.503 --> 42:55.437
Hi, cute doggie.

42:55.438 --> 42:57.206
You should come with us,

42:57.207 --> 42:59.074
if you're notdoing anything else.

42:59.075 --> 43:00.977
Sure.

43:04.280 --> 43:05.949
Ah, ah, ah...

43:08.084 --> 43:09.885
After you.

43:09.886 --> 43:11.521

53:54.797 --> 53:55.897
All right, get readyto rumble, guys.

53:55.898 --> 53:57.565
Weather's wrapping up.

53:57.566 --> 53:58.767
Hey.

53:58.768 --> 54:01.102
Cranberry, pumpkin, acai muffin, Nick?

54:02.571 --> 54:07.075
I was just dreaming aboutcranberry pumpkin acai.

54:07.076 --> 54:07.977
I must have known.

54:07.978 --> 54:09.077
Sonia?

54:09.078 --> 54:10.712
No, I'll pass, thanks.

54:10.713 --> 54:12.414
She's got anotherwedding dress to fit into.

54:12.415 --> 54:13.782
-You're getting married?-No.

54:13.783 --> 54:15.050
Give it a week.

54:15.051 --> 54:16.518
Sonia, that is great!

54:16.519 --> 54:17.619
Give me the details.Who is he?

54:17.620 --> 54:19.487
He's a big-time sports agent.

54:19.488 --> 54:20.688
You should totallybring him

54:20.689 --> 54:21.890
to the affiliatesparty tonight.

54:21.891 --> 54:23.124
It's seriously so much fun.

54:23.125 --> 54:24.526
Everyone gets all glammed up.

54:24.527 --> 54:25.827
It's a work event, right?

54:25.828 --> 54:27.061
I mean, we're supposed to be

54:27.062 --> 54:29.164
meeting the advertisersand the corporate executives.

54:29.165 --> 54:30.432
Going to have to dragthat Hazmat suit

54:30.433 --> 54:31.433
out of the closet, aren't you?

54:31.434 --> 54:32.734
Hey, Nick, if you're notgoing with anyone,

54:32.735 --> 54:33.768
you can, uh, take me.

54:33.769 --> 54:34.803
Okay, we're on air in 10, guys.

54:34.804 --> 54:35.937
Uh... sure.

54:35.938 --> 54:36.839
Great.

54:36.840 --> 54:37.939
Well, I'm off.

54:37.940 --> 54:39.407
Can't wait to meet your guy.

54:39.408 --> 54:41.409
...or is it the Sonia and Nick show...

54:41.410 --> 54:43.077
Exclusively on wcv.

54:43.078 --> 54:44.779
Hello, Chicago,

54:44.780 --> 54:49.451
and our vast, internationalinternet audience.

54:49.452 --> 54:50.618
Oh, yes, thank you, world,

54:50.619 --> 54:52.887
for makinghashtag teamsonia trend...

54:52.888 --> 54:55.190
So let's jumpright to it, gentlemen.

54:55.191 --> 54:56.791
You want to getthe little lady back

54:56.792 --> 54:58.593
when you're in the dog house,

54:58.594 --> 54:59.694
nothing does the trick

54:59.695 --> 55:03.131
like an over-pricedgaudy bouquet of roses...

55:03.132 --> 55:04.100
If you were to send me flowers...

55:04.100 --> 55:05.100
Which I wouldn't.

55:05.101 --> 55:07.068
But if you did, it would be a dead plant.

55:07.069 --> 55:09.037
The point is, don't be fooled by flowers.

55:09.038 --> 55:10.839
They look pretty, they smell pretty,

55:10.840 --> 55:14.809
but then they shrivel, wither away, and die.

55:14.810 --> 55:15.810
You do realize

55:15.811 --> 55:17.045
that one of our sponsorsis a florist, right?

55:17.046 --> 55:18.446
A quote comes to mind,

55:18.447 --> 55:20.582
"when someone shows youwho they are,

55:20.583 --> 55:22.083
believe them the first time."

55:22.084 --> 55:23.685
Who said that, a man?

55:23.686 --> 55:25.587
Actually, it was Maya angelou.

55:25.588 --> 55:27.455
You read Maya angelou? I doubt it.

55:27.456 --> 55:28.823
No, it was on a calendar.

55:28.824 --> 55:30.725
I think we should take a call.

55:30.726 --> 55:31.694
You're on.

55:31.695 --> 55:33.595
How do you two feel about kids?

55:33.596 --> 55:35.163
-I love kids.-You mean, for lunch.

55:35.164 --> 55:36.031
No.

55:36.032 --> 55:37.065
You, Nick lyndon,

55:37.066 --> 55:38.233
actually want tohave kids someday?

55:38.234 --> 55:40.101
Yeah, loads of 'em.Don't you?

55:40.102 --> 55:42.237
Yeah. I do. Someday.

55:42.238 --> 55:43.738
When was the last timeyou were around one?

55:43.739 --> 55:45.473
Any woman who's ever dated a man

55:45.474 --> 55:46.541
knows what it's like

55:46.542 --> 55:47.709
to take care of kids.

55:47.710 --> 55:49.944
Ouch.

55:49.945 --> 55:52.181
♪ ♪

56:23.946 --> 56:25.246
Scott?-it's me.

56:25.247 --> 56:27.283

Thank you.

57:05.988 --> 57:07.989
I will put themin water.

57:07.990 --> 57:10.592
So, I heard the show.

57:10.593 --> 57:11.593
Sorry.

57:11.594 --> 57:13.261
I've tried so hardnot to talk about us,

57:13.262 --> 57:16.097
but the callers seemfreakishly interested.

57:16.098 --> 57:17.131
It's okay.

57:17.132 --> 57:18.866
Actually, it turns outit's good publicity.

57:18.867 --> 57:20.134
My phone's beenringing like crazy.

57:20.135 --> 57:21.235
Sympathy calls?

57:21.236 --> 57:22.303
Clients.

57:22.304 --> 57:23.871
That's great.

57:23.872 --> 57:25.273
Well, I can the storyof that time

57:25.274 --> 57:27.308
that I embarrassed youat the Indian restaurant.

57:27.309 --> 57:28.309
Oh, and don't forgetthe bulls game,

57:28.310 --> 57:30.144
how about that timeat the dry cleaners?

57:30.145 --> 57:31.646
The dry cleaners...

57:31.647 --> 57:32.947
We can't go back there, ever.

57:32.948 --> 57:33.948
Ever.

57:33.949 --> 57:35.283
Yeah.

57:35.284 --> 57:36.884
It's weird, isn't it?

57:36.885 --> 57:38.086
I mean, I break up with youon air,

57:38.087 --> 57:39.120
you get a new show.

57:39.121 --> 57:41.623
And you get more business.

57:41.624 --> 57:42.925
Maybe we're better apart.

57:44.960 --> 57:46.962
Oh, I don't know, I wouldn't go that far.

57:48.631 --> 57:50.298
Look, those things I said,

57:50.299 --> 57:51.267
about us wantingdifferent things.

57:51.268 --> 57:53.034
I mean, that was unfair.

57:53.035 --> 57:55.570
Look, just because I've changed, you shouldn't have to.

57:55.571 --> 57:58.172
I should have beenmore supportive.

57:58.173 --> 58:02.011
I'm not readyto give up on us yet.

58:03.045 --> 58:06.648
I don't know, maybe, um...

58:06.649 --> 58:09.851
Maybe we can tryand meet in the middle.

58:09.852 --> 58:13.821
You mean likethe 50-yard line?

58:13.822 --> 58:14.823
Yeah.

58:19.061 --> 58:20.094

58:38.647 --> 58:40.214

58:40.215 --> 58:41.849
Yeah, hear, hear.

58:41.850 --> 58:43.117
Bit of a coup, I guess, huh?

58:43.118 --> 58:44.353
Cheers.

58:45.788 --> 58:48.222
I seeyou got my text.

58:51.827 --> 58:52.894
Yeah, me too.

58:52.895 --> 58:54.163
;all right, I changed.

58:55.197 --> 58:58.267
So, um, what's yourlifestyle show about?

59:00.102 --> 59:01.936
How's your date going?

59:01.937 --> 59:02.871
It's not a date.

59:02.872 --> 59:03.905
Uh-huh.

59:03.906 --> 59:05.139
What, are you going tosit a row behind her

59:05.140 --> 59:06.307
at the table?

59:06.308 --> 59:07.775
Is that an option?

59:07.776 --> 59:09.711
All options open.

59:09.712 --> 59:11.646
How aboutyou and Scott,

59:11.647 --> 59:14.082
you readyto pick out centerpieces?

59:14.083 --> 59:16.050
We're just seeinghow things go.

59:16.051 --> 59:17.852
Yeah? And then what?

59:17.853 --> 59:19.821
I don't know.

59:24.293 --> 59:26.127
Well, whatdo you think?

59:26.128 --> 59:28.963
Gonna go withtoothpick or fork?

59:28.964 --> 59:30.665
Toothpick.

59:30.666 --> 59:31.666
Ew.

59:31.667 --> 59:33.000
I definitelywould have gone fork.

59:33.001 --> 59:34.069
Really?

59:35.771 --> 59:37.271
...you know, if I was in management,

59:37.272 --> 59:38.272
and I had to cut him loose,

59:38.273 --> 59:39.874
I'd say somethingalong the lines of,

59:39.875 --> 59:41.209
you know, "we're justat different junctures

59:41.210 --> 59:42.410
at this point."

59:42.411 --> 59:44.212
I'm going to have to startcharging him for that line.

59:44.213 --> 59:46.781
That's your line?

59:46.782 --> 59:48.750
I should have known.

59:48.751 --> 59:49.917
Well, at leastyou got back together,

59:49.918 --> 59:51.753
and I will take credit for that,

59:51.754 --> 59:53.255
even though, you know...

59:54.123 --> 59:55.090
Never mind.

59:55.091 --> 59:56.758
What?

59:56.759 --> 59:59.026
I don't think I dideither of you any favors.

59:59.027 --> 01:00:00.128
Really?

01:00:00.129 --> 01:00:01.262
Yeah.

01:00:01.263 --> 01:00:02.864
Now that isee you together...

01:00:02.865 --> 01:00:05.700
I don't reallysee you together.

01:00:05.701 --> 01:00:07.168
What are you, a couplescounselor now?

01:00:07.169 --> 01:00:08.903
You're on a datewith a teenager.

01:00:08.904 --> 01:00:10.438
She's 26.

01:00:10.439 --> 01:00:11.906
24.

01:00:11.907 --> 01:00:13.474
She's in her 20s, I think.

01:00:13.475 --> 01:00:14.976
At this juncture, I think it'd be better

01:00:14.977 --> 01:00:16.778
if we stayed out of each other'spersonal lives.

01:00:16.779 --> 01:00:17.713
Look, you're the one

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:18.780
that wanted meto get you back together

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:20.248
with Mr. Dancing-with-the-starsover there.

01:00:20.249 --> 01:00:22.250
Well, I did.I mean, I do...

01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:23.718
"I do." That sounds like a vow.

01:00:23.719 --> 01:00:24.786
What do you care?

01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:25.920
You didn't evenwait around

01:00:25.921 --> 01:00:26.921
to see if I needed a ride home.

01:00:26.922 --> 01:00:27.922
I didn't thinkyou wanted one.

01:00:27.923 --> 01:00:28.923
Well, I didn't!

01:00:28.924 --> 01:00:29.924
-Me either!-Good!

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:34.962
And that's whyour ratings are up 40%.

01:00:41.203 --> 01:00:42.270
We fly him out,

01:00:42.271 --> 01:00:43.371
we throw himthrough some workouts

01:00:43.372 --> 01:00:45.907
and then we give hima big contract.

01:00:45.908 --> 01:00:47.108
Exactly.

01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:48.709
Yeah, fly her out, too.

01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:49.478
First class.

01:00:49.478 --> 01:00:50.345
Yeah.

01:00:50.346 --> 01:00:51.479
Um, fruit basket.

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:52.747
Hotel.

01:00:52.748 --> 01:00:54.081
Oh, they've gota dog, I think.

01:00:54.082 --> 01:00:55.983
I don't know,

01:00:55.984 --> 01:00:57.718
it's a Jack russellor something like that.

01:00:57.719 --> 01:00:59.221
Yeah, perfect.

01:01:11.934 --> 01:01:13.935
I've been seeing this girl

01:01:13.936 --> 01:01:16.771
and I like her, but I don't really like her that much.

01:01:16.772 --> 01:01:18.039
When do I cut bait?

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.307
"Bait." "fish."

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:20.908
This is obviouslya call for Nick.

01:01:20.909 --> 01:01:22.343
Let's be honest, frank.

01:01:22.344 --> 01:01:24.278
You're just afraidshe's gonna cut bait first.

01:01:24.279 --> 01:01:25.413
You wouldn't have calledif you didn't like her.

01:01:25.414 --> 01:01:26.814
So, you know, be a man.

01:01:26.815 --> 01:01:28.217
Hang in there.See what happens, pal.

01:01:29.885 --> 01:01:32.386
Has our very own Nick lyndongone soft?

01:01:32.387 --> 01:01:33.855
Say it ain't so.

01:01:33.856 --> 01:01:34.856
You're listening to

01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:37.291
the Sonia and Nick showon wcv talk radio.

01:01:37.292 --> 01:01:40.996
We'll be back in 60 to find outif our tin man has a heart.

01:01:42.998 --> 01:01:46.367
Did you just advise a callerto pursue a relationship?

01:01:46.368 --> 01:01:48.035
Did I?

01:01:48.036 --> 01:01:49.303
The cave man evolves.

01:01:49.304 --> 01:01:52.006
Another million years, I'll be walking upright.

01:01:52.007 --> 01:01:53.474
Hey, guys, check the group text.

01:01:53.475 --> 01:01:55.843
New ratings are in and they are off the charts.

01:01:55.844 --> 01:01:56.878
Congrats.

01:01:56.879 --> 01:02:00.147
It'll do wonders for Brad's ulcers.

01:02:00.148 --> 01:02:02.049
Okay, pop quiz.

to all of you,

01:19:04.138 --> 01:19:06.206

The truth is,

01:19:08.276 --> 01:19:12.112
I have no idea what I am talking about.

01:19:12.113 --> 01:19:14.814
I've had relationships,

01:19:14.815 --> 01:19:16.816
but they're always the kind

01:19:16.817 --> 01:19:18.719
where everyone walks awayunscathed.

01:19:19.921 --> 01:19:23.156
Hearts don't get broken.

01:19:23.157 --> 01:19:27.060
And then I did something...

01:19:27.061 --> 01:19:31.464
Really stupid.

01:19:31.465 --> 01:19:33.367
I fell in love.

01:19:36.404 --> 01:19:40.941
But I fell in love with a guywho has zero interest.

01:19:40.942 --> 01:19:42.342
In fact...

01:19:42.343 --> 01:19:48.915
In fact, he thinks of me as an annoying co-worker.

01:19:48.916 --> 01:19:52.452
So now I know what it feels like...

01:19:52.453 --> 01:19:53.720
Hey, Rebecca,

01:19:53.721 --> 01:19:54.854

01:19:54.855 --> 01:19:56.356
Can you put me throughto Sonia's show?
