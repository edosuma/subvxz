09:18.558 --> 09:20.864
We go home and enjoy the view!

09:20.908 --> 09:23.084
Oh, well. No point in
moping around.

09:23.127 --> 09:24.433
I gotta be resourceful!

09:24.476 --> 09:25.608
I'm a father now!

09:25.652 --> 09:28.132
Gramma, we gotta come clean...

09:28.176 --> 09:30.004
Quiet boy, you're makin' me
think too much!

09:30.047 --> 09:31.614
[Claire] Honey, is that you?

09:31.658 --> 09:34.269
[gasps] Family!
I missed you!

09:34.312 --> 09:35.879
Were you able to get the van?

09:35.923 --> 09:37.315
No. And that's okay.

09:37.359 --> 09:40.101
Because from now on,
I'll be the van!

09:40.144 --> 09:41.581
Oh, honey!

09:41.624 --> 09:43.583
[Rick] Seatbelts, everyone!

09:43.626 --> 09:45.759
Come on, Gramma!
This is brutal...

09:45.802 --> 09:48.979
Dang it, boy...
You're right!

09:49.023 --> 09:51.591
[both] We're so sorry!

09:51.634 --> 09:53.897
It's our fault your van's gone!

09:53.941 --> 09:57.118
I kicked away the chocks,
and it flew down the hill!

09:57.161 --> 09:59.487
- [Cricket and Gramma cry]
- Whoa, hold on, what are you
trying to say?

09:59.511 --> 10:02.558
We hated you 'cause
we thought you were a jerk!

10:02.602 --> 10:04.995
But it turns out,
we're the jerks!

10:05.039 --> 10:07.998
We shoulda realized that
everyone's got their own
struggles

10:08.042 --> 10:10.479
and deserves to be
cut some slack!

10:10.522 --> 10:13.656
- And that's why we're gonna
make this right!
- Yeah!

10:13.700 --> 10:15.876
Wha... How? It's impossible!

10:15.919 --> 10:18.052
Nothing's impossible
for a Green!

10:18.095 --> 10:21.708
- [scream]
- Oh, my gosh!

10:21.751 --> 10:25.799
This is bad! Marcus will consume
anything that enters his domain!

10:25.842 --> 10:28.062
[gurgling]

10:29.977 --> 10:31.979
[grunting]

10:34.895 --> 10:36.026
[van screeches]

10:36.070 --> 10:37.070
[groans]

10:39.726 --> 10:41.510
[both] Ta-daa!

10:41.553 --> 10:42.903
My van!

10:42.946 --> 10:44.687
I can't believe you would
do this for us!

10:44.731 --> 10:46.080
Well, you deserve it!

10:46.123 --> 10:47.429
Despite what we first thought,

10:47.472 --> 10:49.102
you turned out to be
a pretty good guy, Rick.

10:49.126 --> 10:51.128
Yeah, feel free to park
in front of our place

10:51.172 --> 10:52.913
whenever you like.

10:52.956 --> 10:54.436
Aw, I really appreciate it.

10:54.479 --> 10:56.264
Hey, I guess it's true
what they say:

10:56.307 --> 10:58.309
Little Tokyo, Big Fish!

10:58.353 --> 11:00.398
[all laugh]

11:01.617 --> 11:03.184
You're going on a diet.
