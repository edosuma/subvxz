01:01.830 --> 01:02.830
Oi!

01:02.880 --> 01:05.430
No petting!

01:05.480 --> 01:07.270
The swimming pool is just that way.

01:07.320 --> 01:09.710
And make sure you go through
the disinfectant pool.

01:09.760 --> 01:11.550
- We don't want any verrucas.
- Hello.

01:11.600 --> 01:15.150
- One for the ladies slipper
baths, love? - Yes, please.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.540
A touch more hot water, please.

01:54.480 --> 02:00.070
From Archimedes' Sand Reckoner to
the Torquetum of Jabir ibn Aflah,

02:00.120 --> 02:02.750
man has sought to create
a "thinking machine"

02:02.800 --> 02:06.830
that equals and even outstrips
the capabilities of his own mind.

02:06.880 --> 02:11.670
Now, with the creation of the Joint
Computing Nexus, or JCN for short,

02:11.720 --> 02:15.350
that dream comes one
step closer to reality.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.270
Good evening, JASON.

02:24.920 --> 02:27.830
And we look forward to
tomorrow's historic chess match

02:27.880 --> 02:30.230
between JASON and Professor Gradenko.

02:30.280 --> 02:31.750
I think I speak for the whole team

02:31.800 --> 02:34.840
when I say we're all looking
forward to meeting Yuri immensely.

02:35.800 --> 02:38.670
Unless there are any further questions...?

02:38.960 --> 02:41.310
- Yes?
- What does it eat?

02:41.360 --> 02:43.310
Journalists.

02:53.280 --> 02:56.430
"An ormolu clock lay amongst the wreckage,

02:56.480 --> 03:00.430
its hands forever stilled at 10:28.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.950
A pair of welted Brogues
betrayed the presence

03:03.000 --> 03:05.390
of the late Eduardo Sanchez.

03:05.440 --> 03:10.000
The body was already cooling, taking
on the familiar stiffness of death.

03:10.840 --> 03:14.270
The blood, settling to the lower
reaches of the circulatory system,

03:14.320 --> 03:17.030
had long fled the fine, aquiline features,

03:17.080 --> 03:21.640
lending them that translucent,
alabaster aspect he knew all too well.

03:22.680 --> 03:27.320
"What a piece of work is a man?"
mused Superintendent Jolliphant."

03:51.800 --> 03:56.510
Winning in straight sets, the
American No.1 seed Billie Jean King.

03:56.560 --> 04:00.190
Science now, and excitement
is mounting in Oxford

04:00.240 --> 04:03.670
on the eve of an historic
encounter between man and machine

04:03.720 --> 04:07.230
as Russian computer scientist
Professor Yuri Gradenko

04:07.280 --> 04:09.670
prepares to take on the
Joint Computing Nexus,

04:09.720 --> 04:12.680
also known as JASON, in a game of chess.

04:23.150 --> 04:24.150
Morning.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.390
- Mrs Thursday.
- Come on through.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.440
He won't be a minute.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.510
Morning, sir.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.720
Morse.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.630
A body's come up below Magdalen Bridge.

04:47.680 --> 04:51.190
The clothes match the description of
a missing person from a month ago.

04:51.240 --> 04:54.950
Professor Neilsen from Lovelace College.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.230
Angler. Uniform are on scene, but
they'd like us to take a look.

04:58.280 --> 04:59.830
Suspicious?

04:59.880 --> 05:01.510
You never know.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.550
Well, you can handle that, can't you?

05:03.600 --> 05:06.340
Drop me by the tobacconist on your way.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.510
Don't forget I'm out tonight.

05:08.560 --> 05:11.470
- Oh. Are you?
- I told you. Keep fit.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.920
- I'll leave you something
to warm through. - Right.

05:38.520 --> 05:41.110
I should hear about my
Sergeant's exam today.

05:41.160 --> 05:43.270
Results are out.

05:43.320 --> 05:46.390
- You'll be off, then.
- Well, no. Not altogether.

05:46.440 --> 05:49.270
There's a vacancy coming up on Nights.

05:49.320 --> 05:52.160
Don't wait. I can walk in from here.

06:04.720 --> 06:06.030
Morning.

06:06.080 --> 06:07.670
Who found him?

06:07.720 --> 06:10.630
Oh, Beaufort hearty, out
for a run just before seven.

06:10.680 --> 06:13.470
This floated loose when we were
bringing the body to shore.

06:13.520 --> 06:16.720
Forensics might be able
to make something of it.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.030
Big day today, isn't it?

06:19.080 --> 06:21.600
Just don't expect me to salute.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.640
Good luck.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.960
Morning.

06:30.280 --> 06:31.870
Keep upwind if I were you.

06:31.920 --> 06:35.310
Four weeks in the drink makes
for a very slippery customer.

06:35.360 --> 06:38.830
This one's as ripe and runny
as a rancid Roquefort.

06:38.880 --> 06:40.510
Is it him?

06:40.560 --> 06:42.190
It's a him.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.230
Further, I shouldn't care to hazard.

06:44.280 --> 06:46.150
For whom were you hoping?

06:46.200 --> 06:49.390
Dr Richard Nielsen, Research
Fellow up at Lovelace.

06:49.440 --> 06:52.030
Keen fisherman. Went missing
around the end of term.

06:52.080 --> 06:55.550
That would certainly accord
with the condition of the corpus.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.750
Contents of the wallet
are pulp, I'm afraid.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.510
This, though. It isn't engraved,

06:59.560 --> 07:01.900
but someone might recognise it.

07:02.360 --> 07:04.030
Foul play?

07:04.080 --> 07:06.870
I need to get him back and pop
him on the radiator for a bit

07:06.920 --> 07:09.030
before I can give you a definitive answer.

07:09.080 --> 07:11.070
Stones in his pockets.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.110
Suicide, most likely.

07:13.160 --> 07:14.750
I don't suppose there's a note?

07:14.800 --> 07:17.070
Oh, he'll have had his reasons, I expect.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.990
Love's very popular.

07:19.040 --> 07:21.800
The want of it. A broken heart.

07:23.280 --> 07:25.750
Where do you stand with all that?

07:26.120 --> 07:27.590
Suicide?

07:27.640 --> 07:29.510
Love.

07:29.560 --> 07:32.660
Bit early in the day for
metaphysics, isn't it?

07:35.720 --> 07:40.510
"And one was fond of
me and all are slain."

07:40.560 --> 07:42.550
Love and fishing.

07:42.600 --> 07:46.100
Sooner or later, it all
comes down to the same thing.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.400
The one that got away.

08:39.600 --> 08:42.470
Not bad for a jumped up letter-sorter, eh?

08:42.520 --> 08:45.150
- How's that? - Well, that's
what JASON was built for.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.950
Mr Benn's nationwide
six-figure postal coding system.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.110
Dad, there you are!

08:50.160 --> 08:52.390
Oh, will you excuse me? Professor Amory.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.070
My daughter Patricia.

08:54.120 --> 08:57.830
Detective Constable Morse, City
Police, Professor, Miss Amory.

08:57.880 --> 09:01.390
Actually, it's Dr Amory, but I prefer Pat.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.630
What can we do for you, Constable?

09:03.680 --> 09:06.070
I believe Richard Nielsen
is a colleague of yours.

09:06.120 --> 09:09.220
Yes, certainly, an integral
member of the team.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.670
Is there news?

09:12.720 --> 09:14.550
I'm afraid a body was recovered

09:14.600 --> 09:17.150
from just below Magdalen
Bridge about an hour ago.

09:17.200 --> 09:22.120
The clothes on the body match the description
we have of those he was last seen wearing.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.940
Sorry to have to tell you.

09:29.680 --> 09:33.230
Well, we knew his fishing
tackle had been found.

09:33.280 --> 09:36.350
I-I-I suppose we hoped that
he had some kind of breakdown

09:36.400 --> 09:38.110
and-and wandered off somewhere.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.470
The scientific world will be
looking at us, especially Russia.

09:41.520 --> 09:43.990
- I'm just telling you how it is.
- If JASON breaks down

09:44.040 --> 09:46.390
because you're too tight
to run to a pack of fuses,

09:46.440 --> 09:49.030
we're all going to look pretty
bloody stupid, aren't we?

09:49.080 --> 09:50.550
Do excuse my colleagues.

09:50.600 --> 09:54.910
Passions are inclined to run a little high on
the eve of an important experiment such as ours.

09:54.960 --> 09:58.030
That's right. The rest of the time,
we're just one big happy family.

09:58.080 --> 10:01.630
This gentleman is from the
police. He's here about Richard.

10:01.680 --> 10:04.270
They've found a body in the Cherwell.

10:04.320 --> 10:07.160
- What?
- Good God, no!

10:08.360 --> 10:11.910
It's a mistake, surely?
You're... sure it's him?

10:11.960 --> 10:14.110
We recovered this from the body.

10:14.160 --> 10:15.950
It's Richard's.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.800
I gave it to him.

10:22.840 --> 10:24.830
Had anything been troubling him?

10:24.880 --> 10:28.350
Well, he was under enormous pressure
with work, but, er, otherwise...

10:28.400 --> 10:30.270
You think he killed himself?

10:30.320 --> 10:32.510
No.

10:32.560 --> 10:35.550
No, I won't believe it. Not Richard.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.790
What about money worries?

10:37.840 --> 10:40.070
Well, if he had got into
pecuniary difficulties,

10:40.120 --> 10:43.720
it's certainly not something
he shared with any of us.

10:47.960 --> 10:50.960
Dr Neilsen's office is
just along here, sir.

10:53.480 --> 10:55.480
Thank you.

11:42.680 --> 11:45.070
That's a splendid backhand pass...

11:45.120 --> 11:46.750
What's all that?

11:46.800 --> 11:49.150
It's the personal effects
of Dr Richard Nielsen.

11:49.200 --> 11:52.070
Been in the property store four
weeks. Thought I'd take a look.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.510
- Suicide, isn't it?
- Supposedly. Where's, uh...?

11:54.560 --> 11:56.160
Gone to lunch.

11:59.240 --> 12:00.390
Ah, Morse...

12:00.440 --> 12:03.270
- Good heavens! What's this?
- Wimbledon, sir.

12:03.320 --> 12:06.070
Ladies highlights in
colour. It's quite lifelike.

12:06.120 --> 12:09.790
As may be, but this is a police
station, not a television showroom.

12:09.840 --> 12:13.590
Fell off the back of a lorry, sir.
Just making sure it's still working.

12:13.640 --> 12:15.600
Yes, well...

12:17.040 --> 12:20.120
- Morse, when you
have a moment... - Sir.

12:23.640 --> 12:27.150
Don't suppose there's any need to ask
what that's about, with the new suit.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.520
- Fingers crossed.
- Thanks.

12:30.560 --> 12:32.350
Failed?

12:32.400 --> 12:37.190
The Board notes with regret that a number of
examination papers never arrived for marking

12:37.240 --> 12:40.540
and were, therefore, classed
an automatic failure.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.160
Better luck next time, yes?

12:45.680 --> 12:51.070
One more thing. There's a Russian
arriving at Lovelace College
tomorrow for the chess tournament.

12:51.120 --> 12:53.270
It's Special Branch's bailiwick,

12:53.320 --> 12:56.070
but Division want the
local force represented.

12:56.120 --> 12:58.910
You've some Russian, I believe,
from your time in Signals.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.750
The barest smattering, sir.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.950
That still puts you
ahead of the rest of us.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.240
I want you to act as my ADC and local
liaison with our colleagues in London.

13:08.800 --> 13:12.110
Division has also asked that news of
Dr Neilsen's death is for the moment

13:12.160 --> 13:15.470
withheld from the press for
reasons of political sensitivity.

13:15.520 --> 13:18.350
How many papers went astray?

13:18.400 --> 13:19.870
You said "a number".

13:19.920 --> 13:23.200
If there were any way to find
out, I'd be interested to know.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.000
Hello?

13:49.040 --> 13:51.040
Number two?

13:58.440 --> 14:00.640
Mick! Mick!

14:53.700 --> 14:56.300
That's a waste of good luncheon meat.

14:56.900 --> 14:58.610
Not today.

14:58.660 --> 15:01.050
It will be. Tuesday.

15:01.100 --> 15:04.420
I don't know what it is,
but it's not luncheon meat.

15:07.260 --> 15:09.330
Well, erm, I'm off to see Dr deBryn.

15:09.380 --> 15:12.580
The body we took out of
the river this morning...

15:12.820 --> 15:15.360
.. I'd be glad of your eye over it.

15:16.180 --> 15:17.970
No, you're all right.

15:18.020 --> 15:20.620
When you've seen one drowning, you...

15:22.380 --> 15:25.780
I've a few things to do of my
own. I'll see you back at the nick.

15:38.380 --> 15:40.610
No underlying signs of violence.

15:40.660 --> 15:43.650
I'm waiting on dental records to
put his identity beyond doubt.

15:43.700 --> 15:48.290
Meantime, I'm hoping to be able to lift a
set of prints from the underlying dermis,

15:48.340 --> 15:50.730
but it's a slow process.

15:50.780 --> 15:52.610
Afternoon, Doc. Matey.

15:52.660 --> 15:55.890
- Ah, my three o'clock.
- That's right, Doc.

15:55.940 --> 15:59.450
The body found in the slipper
baths at Cowley Pool, Miss Palfrey.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.570
Yes. No sign of heart attack,

16:01.620 --> 16:04.450
but there is a sizeable
contusion on the back of her head

16:04.500 --> 16:07.850
and a few bruises that
look to be perimortem.

16:07.900 --> 16:11.530
So, what? She's slipped in the
bath, hit her head and gone under?

16:11.580 --> 16:13.370
She's drowned, then?

16:13.420 --> 16:15.090
Looks that way.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.850
Anything out of the ordinary?

16:16.900 --> 16:18.970
One or two points of interest.

16:19.020 --> 16:22.050
There were traces of an
oil-based lotion on her face.

16:22.100 --> 16:24.090
Some kind of beauty treatment maybe?

16:24.140 --> 16:27.090
- And the other?
- Well, it's turned mostly to liquid,

16:27.140 --> 16:32.010
but she had some sort of alkali
residue in her ears and up her nose.

16:32.060 --> 16:34.290
Face pack, perhaps?

16:34.340 --> 16:36.850
Women do use them, I believe.

16:36.900 --> 16:39.250
Thanks, Doc.

16:39.300 --> 16:44.170
There wasn't anything like that
in the cubicle, and it's not like
they'd had a chance to tidy it.

16:44.220 --> 16:46.210
Have you been to her home yet?

16:46.260 --> 16:48.050
Not yet. Why?

16:48.100 --> 16:50.770
I'll take it off your hands
if you like, save you the job.

16:50.820 --> 16:52.690
I've nothing else on.

16:52.740 --> 16:54.490
Yeah, all right.

16:54.540 --> 16:57.370
Suppose I'd better make the most
before we lose you to Nights.

16:57.420 --> 16:59.810
When do you reckon you'll start?

16:59.860 --> 17:03.060
My exam paper never reached Division.

17:04.140 --> 17:05.810
"Automatic failure".

17:05.859 --> 17:09.260
Oh. Bad luck, matey.

17:10.619 --> 17:12.290
Still, what was it you said?

17:12.339 --> 17:14.339
"If at first...", eh?

17:19.819 --> 17:22.930
Hello. Detective Constable Morse.

17:22.980 --> 17:26.290
- City Police. Miss...?
- Er, Tessa Knight, Oxford Mail.

17:26.339 --> 17:27.930
I'm on a death knock.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.810
Give me a break or my
editor'll have my guts.

17:30.860 --> 17:32.490
I know Miss Frazil of old.

17:32.540 --> 17:35.290
Tell her you ran into Morse
and he was very unhelpful.

17:35.340 --> 17:37.140
She'll understand.

17:38.580 --> 17:40.520
If you'll excuse me...

18:16.860 --> 18:20.530
Miss Palfrey had been in service,
according to the neighbours. Spinster.

18:20.580 --> 18:23.450
She was a regular member of the
congregation at St Cecilia's.

18:23.500 --> 18:27.690
Straightforward "accidental", then.
Make a nice change for the coroner.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.730
Two drownings in one day.

18:29.780 --> 18:32.370
- That's unusual, don't you think?
- Not specially.

18:32.420 --> 18:35.530
He might been found today, but
Dr Nielsen's been dead a month.

18:35.580 --> 18:37.050
How many die on the roads in a day?

18:37.100 --> 18:39.770
- Doesn't make it murder.
- Not by itself, perhaps.

18:39.820 --> 18:43.410
Why would Miss Palfrey go to the slipper
baths if she had a bathroom at home?

18:43.460 --> 18:46.250
Not everyone grew up with indoor plumbing.

18:46.300 --> 18:50.810
Maybe she thought it was cheaper to go there
once a week than heat the tank. Who knows?

18:50.860 --> 18:53.410
"Who knows?" Sure you
don't mean "Who cares?"

18:53.460 --> 18:56.330
- Look, the world doesn't stop
just because... - Because what?

18:56.380 --> 18:59.970
- You mind your place.
- What is that, exactly? My place?

19:00.020 --> 19:02.410
Your place is where I say
it is. No more and no less.

19:02.460 --> 19:04.490
Right. Right.

19:04.540 --> 19:07.650
Just don't go making something
out of nothing, that's all.

19:07.700 --> 19:09.770
- It's what we do, isn't it?
- It's what you do!

19:09.820 --> 19:14.770
Didn't have your head in the clouds,
you might've gone better with your
Sergeant's. Mr Bright mentioned.

19:14.820 --> 19:19.410
Did he mention I could've revised till
Ragnarok for all the good it would've done me?

19:19.460 --> 19:21.810
If my exam doesn't arrive,
it's automatic failure.

19:21.860 --> 19:23.600
Right. Home time.

19:34.300 --> 19:36.300
Home!

20:12.780 --> 20:16.490
Richard should've been here
for the final preparations.

20:16.540 --> 20:20.090
I know. We all miss him.

20:20.140 --> 20:21.570
Do you?

20:21.620 --> 20:24.010
And what does that mean?

20:33.260 --> 20:35.540
Nothing to do with me.

20:36.420 --> 20:38.570
Gremlins.

20:38.620 --> 20:41.530
- I'll let it settle.
- We can't take any chances.

20:41.580 --> 20:46.090
General reset. JASON breaks down tomorrow,
we'll be laughed out of college.

20:46.140 --> 20:48.970
- Stick the kettle on, make a brew.
- No, no. It's all right.

20:49.020 --> 20:51.010
No point us both missing a night's sleep.

20:51.060 --> 20:53.290
Sure?

20:53.340 --> 20:55.340
I'll come in early.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.850
I thought you said he
was a seasoned angler.

21:35.900 --> 21:39.220
A Minister's Dog is eccentric,
even by our standards.

21:40.340 --> 21:41.930
The name of the fly.

21:41.980 --> 21:44.610
There are more vulgar appellations.

21:44.660 --> 21:46.930
- Such as?
- The Vicar's Bitch, for one.

21:46.980 --> 21:51.210
Legend has it the fly was fashioned
using hairs from a cleric's Labrador.

21:51.260 --> 21:54.610
- Why eccentric?
- You can take trout on it,

21:54.660 --> 21:57.340
but traditionally it's a salmon fly.

21:58.500 --> 22:00.490
No salmon in this neck of the woods.

22:00.540 --> 22:03.620
No salmon in any of the rivers in Oxford.

22:19.660 --> 22:23.090
I'm sorry, the pool's closed,
love. I'm just cashing up.

22:23.140 --> 22:25.410
Detective Constable Morse, City Police.

22:25.460 --> 22:28.410
There was a woman found
dead in the slipper baths.

22:28.460 --> 22:31.000
Which cubicle would that have been?

22:31.500 --> 22:33.370
It was cubicle two.

24:17.660 --> 24:20.850
Professor Gradenko, may
I introduce my driver,

24:20.900 --> 24:24.300
- Woman Police Constable Trewlove?
- How do you do?

24:25.900 --> 24:28.240
And Detective Constable Morse.

24:34.940 --> 24:37.210
If you're ready, Professor...

24:38.380 --> 24:41.460
Excellent, Morse. Excellent.

24:47.180 --> 24:50.610
- What's wrong with your breakfast?
- There's nothing wrong with it.

24:50.660 --> 24:53.130
Just not in the mood this morning.

24:54.740 --> 24:56.330
I miss her too.

24:56.380 --> 24:58.370
I know you do.

24:58.420 --> 25:01.010
Two weeks. It's not our Joan.

25:01.060 --> 25:03.530
Not to keep us in the dark like this.

25:03.580 --> 25:05.610
Not a word.

25:05.660 --> 25:08.370
- Oh, Fred...
- She's all right.

25:08.420 --> 25:12.410
I know she is. She... She just needs time.

25:12.460 --> 25:15.060
She'll get in touch when she's ready.

25:16.820 --> 25:19.410
Here, what's all this
with last night's paper?

25:19.460 --> 25:21.450
Situations vacant.

25:21.500 --> 25:23.570
I thought I might get a little job.

25:23.620 --> 25:25.090
Skivvying?

25:25.140 --> 25:27.410
Cleaning, offices.

25:27.460 --> 25:29.210
No shame in it.

25:29.260 --> 25:31.250
Never said there is.

25:31.300 --> 25:35.490
It's all right for you.
You've got work to go to.

25:35.540 --> 25:37.210
I'm just here.

25:37.260 --> 25:41.370
Mornings are all right, I've
got enough to keep me busy,

25:41.420 --> 25:44.410
but after lunch...

25:44.460 --> 25:46.050
It's the afternoons.

25:46.100 --> 25:49.250
You're not going to be cleaning in
the afternoons, if it's offices.

25:49.300 --> 25:53.220
No, it's earlies, but I'll
see your sandwiches are done.

26:00.140 --> 26:03.940
Ladies and gentleman,
Professor Yuri Gradenko.

26:09.580 --> 26:11.770
I meant to say...

26:11.820 --> 26:14.010
commiserations.

26:14.060 --> 26:17.650
Your Sergeant's. It's rotten luck.

26:17.700 --> 26:20.700
Well, I'm not sure how
much luck was involved.

26:24.060 --> 26:25.610
Look, can you cover for me later?

26:25.660 --> 26:28.010
I have to call Inspector
Thursday at the station.

26:28.060 --> 26:29.730
Of course. What's up?

26:29.780 --> 26:33.180
Oh, just something I came across
at Cowley Baths last night.

26:39.380 --> 26:43.330
- I didn't know your enthusiasms ran to chess.
- They don't, usually.

26:43.380 --> 26:45.770
I'm here in an official capacity.

26:45.820 --> 26:48.290
Not seen much of you
since the Wessex raid.

26:48.340 --> 26:51.340
When are you gonna give
me the inside story?

26:52.380 --> 26:54.890
I'm sure you've spoken to everybody else.

26:54.940 --> 26:58.330
All bar you and Inspector
Thursday's daughter.

26:58.380 --> 27:00.770
The bank couldn't tell
me when she'll be in.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.090
She's gone away, I believe, to recuperate.

27:03.140 --> 27:05.020
You all right?

27:06.100 --> 27:09.570
You don't look as though you've
been sleeping. You've lost weight.

27:09.620 --> 27:11.820
You're not in love, are you?

27:12.760 --> 27:14.090
On my wages?

27:14.140 --> 27:17.620
Gentlemen, if you take your
places, the tournament can begin.

27:27.900 --> 27:29.900
Pawn to Queen's four.

28:23.540 --> 28:25.940
There will now be a short break.

28:30.540 --> 28:32.880
Dr Amory, do you have a moment?

28:34.500 --> 28:37.050
- Have you heard any news on Richard?
- What's this?

28:37.100 --> 28:38.290
Oh...

28:38.340 --> 28:41.330
Miss Knight from the
Oxford Mail, Dr Amory...

28:41.380 --> 28:42.890
So I...?

28:42.940 --> 28:44.810
Would you excuse us?

28:47.740 --> 28:51.290
Morse, this is a friend of mine.

28:51.340 --> 28:54.170
Hi. Kent Finn. Hello.

28:54.220 --> 28:57.650
- Kent writes whodunits.
- Crime fiction, Doe, please.

28:57.700 --> 29:00.130
A bastard form of
literature, but mine own.

29:00.180 --> 29:02.490
He'd like to pick your brains.

29:02.540 --> 29:04.530
Well... such as they are.

29:04.580 --> 29:08.130
Don't be deceived. He hides it well, but
Morse is the cleverest man in Oxford.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.090
Oh! I'm cut to the quick.

29:10.140 --> 29:13.450
Second-cleverest, then, now you're here.

29:14.130 --> 29:15.130
You play?

29:15.180 --> 29:16.770
Er, yes, a little.

29:16.820 --> 29:19.050
- You?
- Some. Er, it's why I'm here.

29:19.100 --> 29:20.770
Research for the next novel.

29:20.820 --> 29:22.410
I've rented a place for the summer.

29:22.460 --> 29:25.970
You must come over. Dorothea
tells me you were at Lonsdale.

29:26.020 --> 29:28.090
I'm a Lowlands man, myself.

29:28.140 --> 29:31.010
Red brick and chippy with everything.

29:31.060 --> 29:34.290
But, seriously, you must come over.
I keep a pretty descent cellar.

29:34.340 --> 29:37.090
I'm sure whatever state it's
in it's better than my own.

29:37.140 --> 29:38.810
Nice to meet you.

29:38.860 --> 29:41.010
Oh, well, listen, how about eight o'clock?

29:41.060 --> 29:43.850
- Oh, do you mean this evening?
- Well, that'll be nice.

29:43.900 --> 29:46.170
Well, look, perhaps we
could have a blitz after.

29:46.220 --> 29:48.930
You know, in honour of our
respective almae matres.

29:48.980 --> 29:51.170
I think you'd find me
a very poor woodpusher.

29:51.220 --> 29:53.610
Oxford winning? Splendid, hm?

29:53.660 --> 29:56.650
- Actually, it's pretty evenly
poised, sir. - Oh, is it?

29:56.700 --> 30:00.130
- You play a little, Officer?
- Oh, I used to, sir.

30:00.180 --> 30:01.850
At school, for my house.

30:01.900 --> 30:05.370
Ah, well, I'm sure we
all played at school.

30:06.420 --> 30:08.690
The opening appears to have been

30:08.740 --> 30:12.250
the Kronsteen variation of
the Queen's Gambit declined.

30:12.300 --> 30:16.130
Black sacrificed material
for positional advantage.

30:16.180 --> 30:18.050
The question now is whether

30:18.100 --> 30:22.690
he's prepared to accept the exchange of
knights in a bid to develop the centre.

30:22.740 --> 30:25.140
Yes, of course. I didn't mean...

30:25.700 --> 30:28.490
Four five six from Information Room.

30:28.540 --> 30:30.650
More to my officers than a...

30:30.700 --> 30:32.730
- Pretty face?
- .. appears.

30:32.780 --> 30:34.810
I was going to say. Appears.

30:34.860 --> 30:37.930
Ladies and gentlemen, if
you'd please take your seats,

30:37.980 --> 30:39.810
the tournament is about to continue.

30:39.860 --> 30:43.260
Morse, we've been requested to
attend Cowley Baths immediately.

31:00.180 --> 31:03.020
Drowned, within the last 12 hours.

31:04.100 --> 31:06.610
Almighty lump on the back of his head too,

31:06.660 --> 31:08.890
hour or two before he died.

31:08.940 --> 31:10.770
Suspicious, then?

31:10.820 --> 31:13.570
He could've injured himself
earlier in the evening.

31:13.620 --> 31:16.690
Slow subdural haemorrhage.
He comes for a swim,

31:16.740 --> 31:20.330
pressure builds on the cerebral
cortex and good night, Vienna.

31:20.380 --> 31:24.530
Give you the definitive prix
fixe once I've had a rootle.

31:24.580 --> 31:26.570
Gentlemen...

31:26.620 --> 31:28.250
Who was he?

31:28.300 --> 31:31.050
Don't know. Not a regular,
according to the lifeguard.

31:31.100 --> 31:32.890
What about his clothes?

31:32.940 --> 31:35.690
He should have a rubber band,
around his ankle, or his wrist,

31:35.740 --> 31:38.570
- with a key and locker number.
- E4, according to the band.

31:38.620 --> 31:42.100
The key doesn't fit, so we're
getting a master from reception.

31:43.380 --> 31:45.570
Well, whoever he is, he
wasn't here last night.

31:45.620 --> 31:47.810
How do you know that?

31:47.860 --> 31:50.000
Because I'd have seen him.

31:56.020 --> 31:59.020
I came in here to see
where Miss Palfrey died.

31:59.620 --> 32:02.130
I found a crucifix on the door.

32:02.180 --> 32:04.260
Then this caught my eye.

32:12.740 --> 32:14.460
"Denial"?

32:15.620 --> 32:17.860
Denial of what?

32:19.660 --> 32:22.170
- Writing on the mirror?
- What's it say?

32:22.220 --> 32:25.010
We're more interested in when
it could have been put there.

32:25.060 --> 32:27.170
Well, could've been done any time.

32:27.220 --> 32:29.330
Well, the place is
cleaned daily, isn't it?

32:29.380 --> 32:33.330
Usually, but we've been a bit
short-handed this last month.

32:33.380 --> 32:36.690
So how many people used cubicle
two after Miss Palfrey died?

32:36.740 --> 32:40.370
Nobody. We shut it up, out of respect.

32:40.420 --> 32:43.570
And of course, the bath needed
a full hygienic, you know...

32:43.620 --> 32:45.210
It's, er, it's standard procedure.

32:45.260 --> 32:47.970
Get a lot of people die in there, do you?

32:48.020 --> 32:50.490
Our safety records are spotless.

32:50.540 --> 32:55.450
I've been here eight years, and we've
never had nothing like this happen before.

32:55.500 --> 32:57.410
In 1959, nobody died.

32:57.460 --> 33:00.970
- In 1960, nobody died. In 1961...
- All right we get the picture.

33:01.020 --> 33:02.810
So, what about this "full hygienic"?

33:02.860 --> 33:04.610
I was gonna do it before we opened up,

33:04.660 --> 33:06.690
only he said we weren't to open up.

33:06.740 --> 33:10.610
So how could somebody have got in
for a swim if the place is locked?

33:10.660 --> 33:12.890
- I don't know.
- Who's got keys?

33:12.940 --> 33:14.940
Well, we have.

33:16.100 --> 33:19.410
- A set each. - What about past
employees? We'll need a list.

33:19.460 --> 33:23.290
I'll talk to Mr Smedley. Staff
records are held up at the council.

33:23.340 --> 33:26.280
Any case, that locker
key you were after...

33:35.380 --> 33:37.490
Edison D Smalls, sir.

33:37.540 --> 33:39.170
Summertown address.

33:39.220 --> 33:42.820
And a pass for his work.
Looks to be the pump station.

33:43.380 --> 33:46.090
- How's he locked his key
in his locker? - He hasn't.

33:46.140 --> 33:48.820
This isn't E4, it's E5.

33:52.060 --> 33:53.650
F4.

33:53.700 --> 33:56.800
What's this? Somebody's
idea of Take Your Pick?

33:59.780 --> 34:01.780
E4...

34:06.700 --> 34:11.130
.. and a bunch of envelopes, empty.

34:11.179 --> 34:13.650
- Swimming pool address.
- Sick joke.

34:13.699 --> 34:16.699
I'll see if the staff
know anything about it.

34:20.540 --> 34:24.699
This boy, connected to the
other two, do you think?

34:26.100 --> 34:28.090
It's not my place to say.

34:28.139 --> 34:30.730
Who knows? Right?

34:30.780 --> 34:32.650
Don't come the old acid. It don't suit.

34:32.699 --> 34:35.330
You didn't listen. I told
you it was suspicious.

34:35.380 --> 34:38.650
- About your business, Constable.
- I don't have any orders, sir.

34:38.699 --> 34:41.800
Find out how he got in
when the place was shut.

34:43.780 --> 34:47.010
So the boiler's inspected a couple
of times a year by the council.

34:47.060 --> 34:49.130
I don't bother with it otherwise.

34:49.179 --> 34:52.650
It's their responsibility to make
sure that the service hatch is secure.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.449
And when were they last here?

34:54.500 --> 34:56.610
Er, four months, maybe?

34:56.659 --> 34:59.650
What were your movements last
night, after you closed up?

34:59.700 --> 35:01.610
I went home.

35:01.660 --> 35:04.490
- Can anyone vouch for you?
- Mona on reception.

35:04.540 --> 35:07.380
Mona by name... Yeah, she'll vouch.

35:08.660 --> 35:11.860
All right, Mr Mitcham, I can
take it from here. Thank you.

36:23.820 --> 36:27.290
There's a route through the boiler
room to an unsecured service hatch.

36:27.340 --> 36:30.210
Recent footprints in the dust,
how Edison got in, presumably.

36:30.260 --> 36:32.050
I'll get a photographer down there.

36:32.100 --> 36:34.890
Finish up here, then you and
Trewlove bring his parents in.

36:34.940 --> 36:37.410
I'll see you back at the station.

36:39.380 --> 36:42.170
You weren't concerned
when he didn't come home?

36:42.220 --> 36:44.650
He's always late on a Tuesday, sir.

36:44.700 --> 36:46.450
He helps out down at the youth club.

36:46.500 --> 36:48.690
He's been going there
since he was a boy, sir.

36:48.740 --> 36:52.530
A lot of his friends from school were
always getting in trouble with the law.

36:52.580 --> 36:55.250
- I mean, nothing serious.
- No, sir. Nothing serious.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.890
Temperament and high-spirited.

36:57.940 --> 37:01.570
There were that teacher that used to
help out at the youth club of an evening.

37:01.620 --> 37:05.010
- He took him under his wing,
taught him chess. - Chess?

37:05.060 --> 37:09.330
- Yes, and he was so good at it.
- Played it at the club all the time.

37:09.380 --> 37:12.890
Edison always said it was that club
that kept him on the straight and narrow.

37:12.940 --> 37:18.290
When he got older, he wanted to help other
youngsters, like himself, to keep out of trouble.

37:18.340 --> 37:20.970
He got on all right with
his mates, did he, at work?

37:21.020 --> 37:23.620
Oh, yes, sir. Everybody liked Edison.

37:25.220 --> 37:29.010
Does my boy look all right? Because I
don't want his mother seeing him if he's...

37:29.060 --> 37:31.370
Like he's sleeping, Mr Smalls.

37:31.420 --> 37:33.490
Just like he's sleeping.

37:35.220 --> 37:37.250
You think somebody did this to Edison?

37:37.300 --> 37:42.740
If they did, sir, we'll have 'em.
No stone unturned, you have my word.

37:44.580 --> 37:47.890
I just can't understand
what he was doing there.

37:47.940 --> 37:49.570
Why?

37:49.620 --> 37:51.860
Edison couldn't swim.

37:55.340 --> 37:57.330
Right, gentlemen, I'm fairly confident

37:57.380 --> 37:59.130
this will be of interest to you both.

37:59.180 --> 38:03.410
Some kind of plaster would be my best
guess, recovered from his nostrils.

38:03.460 --> 38:05.170
Most of it had washed out,

38:05.220 --> 38:08.850
but this was packed towards the
upper part of the nasal cavity.

38:08.900 --> 38:11.410
Was it the same thing you
found with Miss Palfrey?

38:11.460 --> 38:13.370
Whatever hers was had turned to liquid,

38:13.420 --> 38:15.530
but I'm sending this off for comparison.

38:15.580 --> 38:18.970
He had traces of the same
oil-based lotion on his face.

38:19.020 --> 38:22.370
I don't suppose there was anything
found like that on Dr Nielsen?

38:22.420 --> 38:23.620
No.

38:26.700 --> 38:29.330
He was drowned, though, the Smalls lad?

38:29.380 --> 38:30.730
Oh, yes.

38:30.780 --> 38:33.810
I've drained the lungs, but with
a drowning in a swimming pool

38:33.860 --> 38:36.060
I'd expect to find chlorine.

38:36.820 --> 38:39.290
- And that isn't the case?
- No.

38:39.860 --> 38:42.130
Initial tests suggest traces of fluoride.

38:42.180 --> 38:44.450
Tap water?

38:44.500 --> 38:47.330
All I can tell you is
that wherever he drowned,

38:47.380 --> 38:49.660
it wasn't in Cowley Baths.

39:18.940 --> 39:23.330
A case of this magnitude, multiple
victims and a motive as yet unknown,

39:23.380 --> 39:27.500
I'm sure I don't have to impress on
you the need for absolute discretion.

39:28.140 --> 39:33.690
It's imperative that no detail of this
investigation be divulged beyond these walls,

39:33.740 --> 39:38.090
either at home with one's family or
amongst yourselves while off-duty.

39:38.140 --> 39:42.060
Control of information in a case
like this gives us the upper hand.

39:43.300 --> 39:46.300
Careless talk may very well cost lives.

39:48.380 --> 39:50.380
All right, that's all.

39:52.740 --> 39:55.650
- So, this latest victim...
- Edison Smalls, sir.

39:55.700 --> 39:58.930
If he didn't die in the
swimming pool, where did he die?

39:58.980 --> 40:02.970
Tuesday nights, he helped out at Wilkins
Youth Club, sir. They've been spoken to.

40:03.020 --> 40:05.690
Smalls left about half-ten.
Nobody saw him again.

40:05.740 --> 40:07.730
No-one except the killer, at least.

40:07.780 --> 40:09.810
What about the staff at the baths?

40:09.860 --> 40:11.530
Clean as a whistle, sir.

40:11.580 --> 40:14.850
All alibied and no previous on any
of 'em, as with the ex-employees.

40:14.900 --> 40:16.850
Anything to connect the victims?

40:16.900 --> 40:19.290
An academic, a retired
servant of some sort

40:19.340 --> 40:21.410
and a worker at the pumping station.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.930
Unlikely to move in the
same social circle.

40:23.980 --> 40:27.370
Maybe they're just random -- strangers'
names picked out of a phone book.

40:27.420 --> 40:30.690
Well, if that's the case, his next
victim could be anyone in Oxford.

40:30.740 --> 40:35.290
Morse, any thoughts? Not like you
to be backward in coming forwards.

40:35.340 --> 40:37.340
I couldn't say, sir.

40:38.060 --> 40:40.730
Morse was onto it from the start, sir.

40:40.780 --> 40:43.650
- Well, it was just a feeling.
- And now?

40:43.820 --> 40:46.690
The link is how they died, surely.

40:46.740 --> 40:50.450
Drowning... I mean, it's all a
little baroque, don't you think?

40:50.500 --> 40:52.370
And for those of us in the cheap seats?

40:52.420 --> 40:54.210
Overly-ornamented.

40:54.260 --> 40:57.610
The wrong fly on Dr Nielsen's fishing rod.

40:57.660 --> 41:00.610
This message on the mirror.
The post in the lockers.

41:00.660 --> 41:02.890
That's not random. That's design.

41:02.940 --> 41:06.290
- So what does it mean?
- Whatever it means, it's his rules, his game.

41:06.340 --> 41:08.330
He's telling us what he wants us to know.

41:08.380 --> 41:10.210
So what doesn't he want us to know?

41:10.260 --> 41:15.010
Why the first victim? That's the
key. What made Dr Nielsen special?

41:15.060 --> 41:17.260
That's the King's Gambit.

41:18.300 --> 41:21.090
- How's this?
- E4, E5, F4...

41:21.140 --> 41:23.250
That's the lockers at Cowley Baths, sir.

41:23.300 --> 41:25.250
It's algebraic chess notation, sir.

41:25.300 --> 41:29.410
The King's Gambit was a popular sequence
of opening moves in the 19th century.

41:29.460 --> 41:32.330
So the killer's some sort of chess expert?

41:32.380 --> 41:36.450
There was a chess set at Miss
Palfrey's house, set out mid-game.

41:36.500 --> 41:39.130
What about these boffins at
Lovelace? That's all chess.

41:39.180 --> 41:40.970
Dr Nielsen was one of their outfit.

41:41.020 --> 41:44.290
Well, they're computer
experts, not chess enthusiasts,

41:44.340 --> 41:46.330
but, yes, I could take a look.

41:46.380 --> 41:49.100
- Very well. Carry on.
- Well done.

42:15.300 --> 42:18.980
JASON's been thinking about his
next move for nearly 40 minutes.

42:20.300 --> 42:22.570
Yuri's got us beaten by time alone.

42:22.620 --> 42:24.260
Bad luck.

42:33.740 --> 42:35.730
Good heavens.

42:35.780 --> 42:37.450
Knight takes rook.

42:37.500 --> 42:40.120
That's check mate in 15.

42:43.020 --> 42:45.020
Thank you. Thank you.

42:52.060 --> 42:53.890
Cheers!

42:53.940 --> 42:56.010
And again. Cheers!

42:56.060 --> 42:57.850
Cheers!

42:57.900 --> 43:00.770
- One, two, three. Cheers!
- Cheers!

43:00.820 --> 43:02.020
Yuri!

43:03.260 --> 43:06.060
Oh, come on, old chap. Napoleon's dictum.

43:12.380 --> 43:14.060
Dr Amory.

43:15.100 --> 43:17.610
This cigarette case that
you gave Dr Nielsen...

43:17.660 --> 43:19.650
It was his birthday.

43:19.700 --> 43:22.130
I just wanted to do
something nice for him.

43:22.180 --> 43:24.180
Nothing more than that?

43:26.420 --> 43:29.290
It's always sex with the police, isn't it?

43:29.860 --> 43:32.930
A girl can't just be friends
with a chap. It's has to be sex.

43:32.980 --> 43:37.290
Or love. In my experience, as
many kill for love as desire.

43:37.340 --> 43:40.180
It stirs up the mud, requited or not.

43:41.500 --> 43:46.090
Could anyone have misread your
friendship with Dr Nielsen?

43:46.140 --> 43:50.050
Look, my only role here

43:50.100 --> 43:53.250
and my only interest is
looking after my father.

43:53.300 --> 43:56.450
No-one's bought me flowers
or made a pass at me

43:56.500 --> 43:58.570
or sent me billets-doux.

44:13.780 --> 44:15.610
Beautiful, yes?

44:15.660 --> 44:17.610
Richard was fond of water lilies.

44:17.660 --> 44:19.650
You knew Dr Nielsen?

44:19.700 --> 44:21.530
A remarkable young man.

44:21.580 --> 44:24.180
I was very sad to hear of his death.

44:24.900 --> 44:27.090
We exchanged letters for several years.

44:27.140 --> 44:29.140
Chess, you understand.

44:30.180 --> 44:33.130
It is your responsibility
to find out who killed him.

44:33.180 --> 44:34.970
He drowned.

44:35.020 --> 44:37.370
In my country, people drown also.

44:37.420 --> 44:39.620
Sometimes, even by accident.

44:40.060 --> 44:43.930
You have to catch the person
who killed Richard Nielsen.

44:43.980 --> 44:47.490
His last letter he sent, he said
there were problems within his group.

44:47.540 --> 44:49.490
What kind of problems?

44:49.540 --> 44:51.970
He didn't say, but you should know

44:52.020 --> 44:56.050
our opinions were simpatico
upon certain important matters.

44:56.100 --> 44:57.890
Such as?

44:57.940 --> 45:02.410
The threat to the world posed by the
ideologies of our respective governments.

45:02.460 --> 45:04.330
Professor Gradenko!

45:07.700 --> 45:09.700
I have to go.

45:12.060 --> 45:15.010
- Dr Castle.
- Oh, hello.

45:15.060 --> 45:16.810
- Do you have a moment?
- Of course.

45:16.860 --> 45:19.690
We're just... We're anxious
to get a better picture

45:19.740 --> 45:22.730
of Dr Nielsen's relationship
with the rest of the team.

45:22.780 --> 45:25.780
- Had he fallen out with anyone?
- Er... Er...

45:26.460 --> 45:29.930
Look, I'm just a junior fellow here.
It's not really my place to say.

45:29.980 --> 45:32.690
It's not really your place to say what?

45:32.740 --> 45:36.340
I just wouldn't want to speak
out of turn, that's all.

45:37.420 --> 45:39.490
Perhaps speak to Bernard.

45:40.140 --> 45:42.130
Sorry.

45:42.180 --> 45:44.170
Yes, I argued with Richard.

45:44.220 --> 45:47.010
We overspent our research
budget by quite a margin.

45:47.060 --> 45:49.730
And that caused conflict
between you and Dr Nielsen?

45:49.780 --> 45:52.890
He was convinced someone was
making something on the side,

45:52.940 --> 45:54.650
demanded to see the accounts.

45:54.700 --> 45:56.530
- Did you give them to him?
- No.

45:56.580 --> 45:58.850
I think he took them just
before he disappeared.

45:58.900 --> 46:01.970
There you are. Just the man.
I've been looking for you.

46:02.020 --> 46:04.820
So, come on. Foul play, right?

46:06.220 --> 46:09.940
Look, you can tell me. I won't
breathe a word. Guides' honour.

46:11.580 --> 46:13.580
Well, what do you know?

46:14.460 --> 46:16.570
Tit for tat? All right.

46:16.620 --> 46:20.010
Ah, the old lady who died there yesterday

46:20.060 --> 46:23.250
used to work for a doctor's
family out by Binsey.

46:23.300 --> 46:24.970
You show me yours.

46:25.020 --> 46:27.020
(Was it murder?)

46:28.060 --> 46:30.800
We're treating it as a suspicious death.

46:32.500 --> 46:34.170
So, this doctor...?

46:34.220 --> 46:36.410
Er, Aston or Ashford.

46:36.460 --> 46:39.290
And what about the one
today? Danny Smalls?

46:39.340 --> 46:41.330
- Look, just...
- I knew it.

46:41.380 --> 46:45.050
Get his name right, at least for his
parents' sake. It's Edison Smalls.

46:45.100 --> 46:47.730
Workmates all called him Danny or Daniel.

46:47.780 --> 46:49.770
He only got Edison at home.

46:49.820 --> 46:53.450
So, this Aston or
Ashford, what about them?

46:53.500 --> 46:57.530
Miss Palfrey may have been closer to
the doctor than his wife cared for.

46:57.580 --> 46:59.050
There was a divorce.

46:59.100 --> 47:03.700
My source says it was some kind of
local cause celebre. Made the papers.

47:06.300 --> 47:08.370
Thanks you for the steer.

47:14.660 --> 47:16.450
Splendid. Splendid. Yeah.

47:16.500 --> 47:19.170
Well, I wasn't sure if you would come.

47:21.380 --> 47:25.250
So, I thought, erm, we'd treat
ourselves to a little drop.

47:25.300 --> 47:27.570
Oh, the '61. I'm honoured.

47:27.620 --> 47:30.770
Well, If I was really honouring
you, I would have brought up the '45,

47:30.820 --> 47:32.770
but, erm, perhaps when I know you better.

47:32.820 --> 47:35.620
I'll open this and I'll get some glasses.

48:09.180 --> 48:11.170
Ah! I see you've met my muse.

48:11.220 --> 48:13.370
Haunting, isn't she?

48:13.420 --> 48:16.450
Disturbing, certainly. Who is it?

48:16.500 --> 48:18.010
Nobody knows.

48:18.060 --> 48:21.930
It was a young girl fished out of
the Seine in the 1880s. Story goes,

48:21.980 --> 48:24.730
the attendant in the city morgue
was so taken with her beauty

48:24.780 --> 48:26.730
that he made an impression of her features

48:26.780 --> 48:30.060
in the hope that someone would
recognise her and claim her.

48:30.420 --> 48:33.570
But her likeness caught the
imagination of fashionable Parisians

48:33.620 --> 48:37.530
and, well, by the Yellow '90s,
no self-respecting Bohemian garret

48:37.580 --> 48:41.010
could truly lay claim to being part
of La Belle Epoque without one.

48:41.060 --> 48:42.770
So, erm, yeah...

48:42.820 --> 48:44.490
Right, shall we?

48:44.540 --> 48:46.540
This way.

48:51.580 --> 48:56.930
It must be fascinating work, pitting your
wits against some diabolical villain.

48:56.980 --> 48:58.610
The red herrings.

48:58.660 --> 49:03.290
I don't know, the unexpected twists in the
final act before the killer is revealed.

49:03.340 --> 49:05.130
It might be that way in books.

49:05.180 --> 49:08.130
In real life, it's all
legwork or paperwork,

49:08.180 --> 49:10.920
asking the same questions over and over.

49:12.380 --> 49:14.810
Would you...? Would you
like me to change the music?

49:14.860 --> 49:16.730
I gather opera's more your bag.

49:16.780 --> 49:19.450
Oh, look, don't think too badly of her.

49:19.500 --> 49:21.970
Dorothea holds you in some regard.

49:23.260 --> 49:24.930
How is it you know her?

49:24.980 --> 49:28.330
Oh, she reviewed my last Superintendent
Jolliphant rather favourably,

49:28.380 --> 49:31.850
so I sent flowers to thank
her, and we stayed in touch.

49:31.900 --> 49:34.170
And as I was in Oxford, er...

49:34.940 --> 49:37.290
You're friends, then?

49:37.340 --> 49:39.700
Well, a gentleman never tells.

49:41.660 --> 49:45.160
A gentleman would just say
yes, and leave it at that.

49:45.560 --> 49:46.700
Hm.

50:01.060 --> 50:04.050
If that's for the morning
edition, you're cutting it fine.

50:04.100 --> 50:06.300
Stop press.

50:17.420 --> 50:19.130
What's this?

50:19.180 --> 50:21.520
Well, I'll see you to the stop.

50:22.100 --> 50:24.370
You don't have to wrap
me in cotton wool, Fred.

50:24.420 --> 50:26.290
I won't break.

50:26.340 --> 50:28.340
You're all I've got.

50:31.500 --> 50:33.690
What are you gonna do
till Morse gets here?

50:33.740 --> 50:36.210
Well, take a turn through the park.

50:36.260 --> 50:38.140
Fetch the paper.

50:39.380 --> 50:41.580
Change is as good as a rest.

50:53.340 --> 50:55.340
Here, give us one...

51:02.140 --> 51:05.130
.. the unexpected defeat
of the Russian scientist

51:05.180 --> 51:10.410
Professor Yuri Gradenko by the computer
JASON in a chess match at Lovelace college.

51:10.460 --> 51:15.610
Professor George Amory, who led the Oxford
Team, predicted that within a generation

51:15.660 --> 51:20.050
few compartments of the intellect would
remain outside the machines' realm

51:20.100 --> 51:25.260
and that the problems of creating artificial
intelligence would be substantially solved.

51:30.540 --> 51:32.490
We're no closer to catching this bastard,

51:32.540 --> 51:34.330
and now the whole world knows about it.

51:34.380 --> 51:38.090
We'll have every nutcase and lunatic
in Oxford to claim responsibility

51:38.140 --> 51:41.140
and no way to sort the
wheat from the chaff.

51:41.220 --> 51:43.220
Tessa! Come here.

51:45.260 --> 51:46.890
This story, where did you get it?

51:46.940 --> 51:49.410
Straight from the horse's mouth.

51:49.460 --> 51:51.250
Morse told me at the drinks last night.

51:51.300 --> 51:53.010
In confidence.

51:53.060 --> 51:54.730
Did he say it was off the record?

51:54.780 --> 51:57.050
I shouldn't have to, but
it's beside the point.

51:57.100 --> 51:59.850
There are things that could
only have come from my notebook.

51:59.900 --> 52:02.490
Are you accusing Miss
Knight of stealing it?

52:02.540 --> 52:05.330
Because, if you are, I'd like
the Mail's lawyers present.

52:05.380 --> 52:08.210
If I find this chit of yours
does have Morse's notebook,

52:08.260 --> 52:11.980
I'll have her up before the beak so
fast her feet won't touch the ground.

52:13.460 --> 52:16.730
Whatever professional courtesy
you may have had of me hitherto,

52:16.780 --> 52:20.010
- do not look to rely upon the same in future.
- Professional courtesy?

52:20.060 --> 52:22.800
- I thought we were friends.
- We were.

52:24.900 --> 52:27.050
Running off at the lip
in front of a scribbler!

52:27.100 --> 52:30.410
- I thought you knew better.
- I gave her nothing she hadn't worked out.

52:30.460 --> 52:32.130
You gave her your notebook.

52:32.180 --> 52:33.890
She must've picked my pocket when...

52:33.940 --> 52:36.530
- When what? Bat her lashes, did she?
- What does that mean?

52:36.580 --> 52:39.050
It means you're still
wearing yesterday's shirt,

52:39.100 --> 52:44.170
and that smudge of lipstick on your collar
is the same shade Miss Knight's wearing.

52:44.220 --> 52:47.570
You've got about a second to lose that
smirk before I slap it off your face.

52:47.620 --> 52:49.810
Did you pinch his notebook?

52:49.860 --> 52:53.140
You silly, silly girl.

52:54.300 --> 52:57.490
Do you know, I heard you
were something once...

52:57.540 --> 53:00.770
The Korean War. The Tribune...

53:00.820 --> 53:02.890
Now look at you.

53:02.940 --> 53:06.930
Knocking it back at 11 in the morning,
washed up in some provincial backwater.

53:06.980 --> 53:08.850
One more word, and you're fired.

53:08.900 --> 53:10.930
I resign.

53:10.980 --> 53:13.170
The Sketch saw my piece.

53:13.220 --> 53:16.690
If I can come up with another one like
it, there's a job waiting for me there.

53:16.740 --> 53:19.860
That's right. Fleet Street. London!

53:23.180 --> 53:24.860
Good luck.

53:27.180 --> 53:30.460
Next time you see my name,
it'll be on page one.

53:33.660 --> 53:35.530
Tread lightly, child.

53:35.580 --> 53:37.180
Tread lightly.

53:37.780 --> 53:40.450
After local newspaper
the Oxford Mail revealed

53:40.500 --> 53:44.890
that a murderer who kills his victims
by drowning is at large in the city,

53:44.940 --> 53:49.460
Chief Superintendent Reginald Bright of the
Oxford City Police declined to comment.

53:57.300 --> 54:01.650
Losing one's notebook is about as gross a
dereliction of duty a serving officer can make.

54:01.700 --> 54:04.770
- An honest mistake, sir.
- Honesty doesn't come into it.

54:04.820 --> 54:07.770
- I will thank you not to speak for him.
- It's why I'm here, sir.

54:07.820 --> 54:10.050
Well, you've had your say.

54:10.100 --> 54:12.100
Sir.

54:20.740 --> 54:25.050
You asked me to find out how many
examination papers went astray.

54:25.100 --> 54:27.100
I made enquiries.

54:29.260 --> 54:31.260
The answer was one.

54:32.300 --> 54:34.300
Just yours, Morse.

54:35.460 --> 54:37.460
Just yours.

54:38.780 --> 54:41.610
- I see.
- Do you? I wonder.

54:41.660 --> 54:45.900
This past three years, you've
made some very powerful enemies.

54:46.940 --> 54:49.690
They won't forgive and they won't forget.

54:49.740 --> 54:53.810
They mean to dog your steps until
the very last hour of your service.

54:53.860 --> 54:56.450
And now this... If you want my advice,

54:56.500 --> 54:59.010
your best hope of salvaging
any kind of career

54:59.060 --> 55:01.650
would be to transfer
to another constabulary.

55:01.700 --> 55:03.890
- Leave Oxford?
- Why not?

55:03.940 --> 55:07.130
Fresh start. You've no family local.

55:07.180 --> 55:10.740
As I understand it, there's
nothing to keep you here.

55:17.780 --> 55:19.890
Scotch before lunch?

55:19.940 --> 55:22.210
I thought you said it gave you guts-ache?

55:22.260 --> 55:24.290
How did you leave it?

55:24.340 --> 55:26.340
One step forward.

55:29.420 --> 55:32.700
Now, look, that with Miss Knight...

55:33.740 --> 55:35.370
Go on.

55:35.420 --> 55:38.290
- .. it wasn't just a one-way street.
- What did you get from her?

55:38.340 --> 55:41.650
She told me that Miss Palfrey worked
for a doctor's family out by Binsey,

55:41.700 --> 55:44.290
name of Aston or Ashford.

55:44.340 --> 55:46.050
Now, I've had a look in the Gazetteer.

55:46.100 --> 55:48.810
I can't find anyone with
either name currently in Oxford.

55:48.860 --> 55:53.290
Electoral rolls, then. It could take days to
collate and cross-reference that material.

55:53.340 --> 55:55.410
Yes, but there is another possibility.

55:55.460 --> 55:58.690
Can you do it? Morse said
you ran a demonstration

55:58.740 --> 56:01.250
of the new postal coding
system for the GPO.

56:01.300 --> 56:05.010
Oh, we compiled a database of names
and addresses from the '61 census

56:05.060 --> 56:08.930
and the '64 electoral rolls, but
only for households in Oxfordshire.

56:08.980 --> 56:10.690
That's all we need.

56:10.740 --> 56:12.890
Well, it's possible, of course.

56:12.940 --> 56:16.370
JASON will identify and isolate
any parameters you specify.

56:16.420 --> 56:18.730
Bernard, could you...?

56:18.780 --> 56:21.770
It'll take us a while to find
the tape drums, get them loaded,

56:21.820 --> 56:24.220
but, yes, I don't see why not.

56:28.160 --> 56:29.610
So, erm, what am I looking for?

56:29.660 --> 56:33.290
A Dr Aston or Ashford in the Binsey area.

56:33.340 --> 56:36.530
- Oo-oo-ooh!
- I can do it.

56:36.580 --> 56:38.170
Ooh, no fear.

56:38.220 --> 56:42.010
The last time you input code, JASON
nearly had a nervous breakdown.

56:42.060 --> 56:44.610
- It wasn't that bad.
- Oh, wasn't it?

56:44.660 --> 56:46.690
What he should have
entered was "Read drum".

56:46.740 --> 56:48.410
What was it that you actually put in?

56:48.460 --> 56:50.690
"Rude dram". Look,
anyone can make a mistake.

56:50.740 --> 56:52.330
OK.

56:52.380 --> 56:53.970
Well, I'll make coffee.

56:54.020 --> 56:56.290
I've a feeling we'll need it.

56:56.660 --> 57:00.050
Aston, wasn't it, or Ashford?

57:00.100 --> 57:03.570
Yes, could be either, in the Binsey area.

57:03.620 --> 57:07.050
We might get a better result
if we start with just "A-S",

57:07.100 --> 57:10.050
the first two letters being
shared by both surnames.

57:10.100 --> 57:14.570
Sure, Dr Gould? Wouldn't that give us anyone
whose surname begins with A-S in Oxfordshire?

57:14.620 --> 57:19.260
Binsey should narrow it. Sooner that than
miss a variation. Double-barrelled, even.

57:21.500 --> 57:23.570
So, how does it work, Dr Gibbs?

57:23.620 --> 57:29.100
The program's written in Forbin 66,
with a few additions of our own.

57:30.920 --> 57:32.190
There!

57:33.020 --> 57:34.650
Well, now what?

57:34.700 --> 57:38.130
Now you can sample Broderick's
disgusting home-ground,

57:38.180 --> 57:40.490
or do what I'm going to do.

57:40.540 --> 57:43.450
- Go home to bed.
- That long, you reckon?

57:43.500 --> 57:48.090
You could get lucky, but you're
unlikely to get much back before morning.

57:48.140 --> 57:50.690
JASON will be thinking for quite a while.

57:50.740 --> 57:52.220
Good night.

58:10.780 --> 58:17.410
Oxford is tonight a city in fear as, further
to an initial report in the local paper,

58:17.460 --> 58:22.250
journalist Tessa Knight confided
to this programme that the murderer,

58:22.300 --> 58:25.170
whom she described as "clearly a lunatic,"

58:25.220 --> 58:29.140
has already killed three
victims by drowning.

58:45.380 --> 58:47.570
Hello? Is anyone there?

58:47.620 --> 58:49.620
Hello?

01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:41.370
Three in the..... Binsey area.

01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:44.540
Ashcourt, Ashton and Leighton-Asbury.

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:54.460
- Well, sorry to have troubled
you, Mrs Ashcourt. - No problem.

01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:58.250
- Who's next?
- Ashton is nearer.

01:00:58.300 --> 01:00:59.850
There's two occupants in '64.

01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:02.770
That looks to be a terraced
house, according to the electoral.

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:05.010
Doesn't sound big enough
to warrant servants.

01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:08.610
- What about Leighton-Asbury?
- Briar House, one occupant in '61.

01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:11.260
- A Judith Leighton-Asbury.
- Right.

01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:15.100
Oh!

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:44.420
Gently, if you would, gentlemen.
She's been through quite enough.

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:49.940
Dear God! What is this place?

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:52.530
It appears to be where he
brought his victims, sir,

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:55.050
and made their death masks.

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:58.930
That's where the alkaline residue
on their faces came from.

01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:02.410
The bottom right-hand four
are the recent drownings.

01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:05.090
- And the rest?
- Les Gueules cassees.

01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:07.410
The broken faces.

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:10.460
Soldiers mutilated by
wounds in the Great War.

01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:13.290
What in God's name are they doing here?

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:17.530
Life masks such as these were taken
in order that facial prostheses

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:20.410
could be tailored to the
requirements of the patient.

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:23.130
It would certainly explain
the material I recovered

01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:26.170
from the ears and nasal
cavities of his victims.

01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:28.490
The house belongs to a Dr Leighton-Asbury.

01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:32.370
We've given his details to the General
Medical Council. They're looking into it.

01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:34.090
There's also a wife, Judith.

01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:36.290
She was here in '61, but since then...

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:40.250
I've called the Land Registry, sir,
to see who owns the property now.

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:44.500
Looks to be patient records.
Hundreds of the bloody things.

01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:48.410
Better go through them. See if
any of the names ring a bell.

01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:50.050
There should be a handbag.

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:51.610
Constable?

01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:54.000
She was a reporter, wasn't she?

01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:57.170
She'd need somewhere to keep her notebook.

01:04:57.220 --> 01:05:01.320
Her coat is here. I can't see
her going far without a handbag.

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:27.420
Sir?

01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:30.650
That poor girl.

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:32.900
I should've listened to you.

01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:38.930
Well, you had... things on your mind.

01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:42.210
Who doesn't? It's no excuse.

01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:44.890
This lands at my door, nobody else's.

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:47.130
You couldn't have known.

01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:48.850
You knew.

01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:50.900
You always know.

01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:57.250
And you were cheated with your Sergeant's.

01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:59.970
I know you wanted it. Deserved it too.

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:03.650
But I can't say I'm sorry
not to lose you to Nights.

01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:06.180
You're better than that.

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:15.260
There's a boy's room, across the hallway.

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:19.530
So... a son and a daughter, then.

01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:21.860
The Leighton-Asburys.

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:26.850
"A pupil".

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:30.130
Saves writing the kid's name
out in longhand, I suppose.

01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:32.900
- Cowley Baths.
- Yeah.

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:40.800
There was one of these
at Miss Palfrey's house.

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:44.700
A gift, possibly, from the girl.

01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:09.160
Looks to be pages from a diary.

01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:11.580
Is that French?

01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:18.540
"He won't leave me alone.
He watches me all the time.

01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:24.250
I know what he wants, but I
won't. It's disgusting and wrong.

01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:26.440
There's no-one I can tell.

01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:29.210
I can't see any other way out."

01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:31.850
Who's this "he"? Does she say?

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:35.690
She doesn't name him, but there's
a lot more in a like vein.

01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:37.370
Should I go on, sir?

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:40.490
Get down the station and type up a
translation as quick as you can.

01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:42.540
Sir.

01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:48.370
Garden backs onto the Cherwell. Nothing
down there but some old boathouse.

01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:51.250
Doesn't look like anyone's
been inside for donkey's.

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:53.490
Nearest neighbour's only
been here a few years.

01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:55.890
Just remembers the wife. She died in '62.

01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:57.970
I've spoken to the Royal
Army Medical Corps.

01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:00.650
They're searching for him
in regimental records.

01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:03.330
- There's a son and a daughter.
No names... - Actually, sir,

01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:06.090
just through from the station,
Edison Smalls' previous.

01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:10.290
Three months suspended for a fight with a lad
he used to play chess with down the youth club.

01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:12.480
Alexander Leighton-Asbury.

01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:17.890
I've spoken to Edison's parents. They
were just playing a game, nice as you like.

01:08:17.939 --> 01:08:21.250
Edison said something to the
Leighton-Asbury boy, and he went for him.

01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:23.810
- What did he say?
- Something he didn't like, clearly.

01:08:23.859 --> 01:08:27.609
But push come to shove, it was Edison got
stuck on and the other kid walked away.

01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:29.370
I'll get a trace out for him.

01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:31.300
Right.

01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:36.700
You'd better get over to Miss
Knight's flat, take a look.

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:40.090
This is her room.

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:42.140
Well, thank you.

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:20.210
Er, she was a fan, that's all.

01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:22.250
Erm...

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:25.330
Look, what... What's this all about?

01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:27.130
What it's about, Mr Finn,

01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:30.649
is Tessa Knight lying drowned in an
outsized fish tank over by Binsey,

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:33.890
with a death mask of her face
staring down at her from the wall.

01:09:33.939 --> 01:09:36.689
It's about your muse being
just such a death-mask,

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:39.930
cast from the features of a woman
drowned in the Seine 80 years ago.

01:09:39.979 --> 01:09:44.779
But above all, it's about finding one of
your pipe-cleaner men on her bedside table.

01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:47.050
You were sleeping with her.

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:48.770
For how long?

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:53.250
A couple of weeks, maybe a month.

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:55.530
Such gallantry.

01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:58.130
And when did you really last see her?

01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:02.980
Erm, shortly after you left,
she dropped by, er, briefly.

01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:06.730
Where were you the night
before the chess tournament?

01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:10.780
Erm... with Tessa, at her flat.

01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:14.400
And the night before that?

01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:35.380
If you've come to read me
the riot act, volume two...

01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:42.460
Do you need a drink or
can you tell me straight?

01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:48.860
Is it Tessa?

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:53.860
How bad?

01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:58.570
Her body was found at a house
out by Binsey this morning.

01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:00.620
She'd been drowned.

01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:05.810
You didn't send her there?

01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:10.460
She resigned yesterday
morning, just after you left.

01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:16.810
I have to ask...

01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:20.290
Kent Finn, he said he was with
you the night Miss Palfrey died.

01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:21.850
That's right.

01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:23.730
So you can you give him an alibi.

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:27.090
Why would he need an alibi?
He's nothing to do with Tessa.

01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:28.530
Er...

01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:31.340
Oh. Right.

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:34.170
I see.

01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:36.810
Comes to booze, Kent's
a bit of an amateur.

01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:41.260
I wouldn't have said he was in a state
to drive anywhere, let alone kill anyone.

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:45.690
Binsey, you say, Tessa was found?

01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:48.090
Yes, a house out that way.

01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:50.370
Owned by a family called Leighton-Asbury.

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:52.450
Miss Palfrey was in service there.

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:55.330
- The head of the family is a
doctor of some sort. - Army surgeon.

01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:57.370
Something to do with plastic surgery,

01:11:57.420 --> 01:11:59.810
- for pilots burned in the war.
- Yes, that's right.

01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:03.580
It was one of the first stories
I covered when I came to Oxford.

01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:09.250
The daughter, aged about 16,
drowned herself in the boathouse.

01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:11.770
- Weighted down --
- With stones in her pockets?

01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:13.820
Yeah.

01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:18.410
At the inquest, the
housekeeper Miss Palfrey

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:22.250
gave evidence that the brother
had an unnatural interest in her.

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:24.330
The parents denied it.

01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:27.210
I don't think the coroner wanted
to add to their grief, but...

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:30.460
That would accord with
what we read in her diary.

01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:33.090
So what happened to him?

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:35.410
Sent away. Family somewhere.

01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:39.610
I think the parents split up not
long after. I can look into it.

01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:41.400
I'd be grateful.

01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:44.940
Poor Tessa.

01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:50.490
She'd an idea about some job
in Fleet Street on offer,

01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:52.890
if she got the scoop on all this.

01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:55.130
Last thing she said was,

01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:58.180
"Next time you see my name,
it'll be on the front page."

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:02.970
You're certain the
Leighton-Asbury boy is involved?

01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:05.730
He's the only person we can
connect with Miss Palfrey, sir,

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:07.690
and we know he fought with Edison Smalls.

01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:10.210
It could just as well
have been the father.

01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:13.010
The doctor? Or his wife,
even? Or none of them at all.

01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:16.170
- Just someone who knew the house was empty.
- It's possible, sir.

01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:18.610
Didn't you think there was
a link to the scientists

01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:21.610
up at Lovelace College? Hasn't
that been the thinking so far?

01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:24.490
Well, we can rule out Dr Gould
and Dr Castle straight away.

01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:27.370
We were with them both at the
time Tessa Knight was killed.

01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:29.810
- That leaves who?
- Er, Professor Amory,

01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:32.090
his daughter Pat and Dr Clifford Gibbs.

01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:33.810
Amory's in a wheelchair.

01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:37.170
Hard to see him having the physical
capability of murdering anyone.

01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:40.090
- Gibbs, did you say?
- That's right. Why?

01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:42.890
Yeah.

01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:44.930
I thought I'd seen it.

01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:49.250
Wing Commander Rupert Gibbs,
Six-Oh-Two Squadron, RAF Westhampnett.

01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:52.850
Shot down over Sussex,
September 16th, 1940.

01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:54.770
Damage to the upper and lower maxilla.

01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:57.090
Extensive third-degree burns.

01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:04.850
Could you tell us about your father's
relationship to Dr Leighton-Asbury?

01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:09.650
Yes, Dad was a patient, for
the best part of ten years.

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:11.570
Did you ever go with him, out to Binsey?

01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:13.290
Once or twice.

01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:15.610
Did you know his kids?
He had a son and daughter.

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:18.050
I remember a little girl, vaguely.

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:20.530
What about the boy? Alexander?

01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:22.490
No.

01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:24.530
Been there recently?

01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:27.610
Binsey? Good God, no.
Wouldn't know where to find it.

01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:30.970
Easy enough to find an address,
as you've already demonstrated.

01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:33.170
Why the interest in Leighton-Asbury?

01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:37.930
The body of a young woman was found drowned
at the house in Binsey this morning.

01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:39.690
Tessa Knight.

01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:42.370
That's awful. But if you think

01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:46.370
Dr Leighton-Asbury's got anything
to do with it, you're way off-beam.

01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:49.250
- How's that?
- Well, I'm a scientist.

01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:52.970
I don't go in for God. But
that man was a miracle worker.

01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:55.890
Where were you last night? For the record.

01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:01.890
You know where I was, I told you.

01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:05.730
I went to a recital and then I
went home to bed, for the record.

01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:07.850
- Anyone vouch for that?
- No.

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:09.970
What about Tuesday night?

01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:12.850
I was here, working.

01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:15.450
Bernard told me to reboot JASON.

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.770
Look, if you think that
you've got evidence

01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:21.490
that I'm involved in all of
this, then you should charge me.

01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:24.280
Otherwise, I've got nothing else to say.

01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:30.850
- We're gonna brace Dr Gould as
to Gibbs' alibi. - Right, sir.

01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:33.330
Tail Gibbs. I don't want
him out of your sight.

01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:35.570
We've had word through from the RAMC, sir.

01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:39.500
- Regimental records confirm Dr
Leighton-Asbury's decease. - Right.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:46.490
We're looking for Dr Bernard Gould.

01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:50.610
Erm, you just missed him,
about half an hour since.

01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:54.250
- Any idea where he might be?
- Home. He was feeling under the weather.

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:57.810
Gibbs said Dr Gould told him to reset
JASON the night before the tournament.

01:15:57.860 --> 01:16:00.970
- Would that be regular?
- Yes, JASON had been behaving erratically.

01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:04.090
It's standard practice. You close
the machine down and restart it.

01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:06.650
You turn it off and on again.
How long would that take?

01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:08.660
Oh, a few hours.

01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:24.330
If the reset took a few hours, rather than
the all night that Gibbs had said it did,

01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:27.890
it would give him time to kill Miss
Palfrey and drop her at the swimming pool.

01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:30.940
Information Room to DI Thursday.

01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:34.810
Thursday. Over.

01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:37.690
Message for Morse from Dorothea Frazil.

01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:39.410
Go ahead.

01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:42.930
'Alexander Leighton-Asbury went to
live with his maternal grandparents,

01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:46.570
name of King, in Dundee. She has
further information at the Oxford Mail.

01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:48.380
- Over.'
- Out.

01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:25.740
Sir...

01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:38.290
- You think Gibbs has got Miss Frazil?
- That's how it looks, sir.

01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:40.770
Strange lost him close by
to the offices of the Mail,

01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:42.650
but we've got an alert out to all units.

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:45.130
- Where would he have taken her?
- Don't know yet, sir.

01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:47.770
But here's some news on
the Leighton-Asbury girl.

01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:51.610
A birth registered in the second
quarter of 1939. Penelope.

01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:53.930
Perhaps we should try the swimming baths.

01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:55.650
Maybe he's taken her there.

01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:58.500
Tessa Knight's coat did reek of chlorine.

01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:13.860
Out.

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:18.210
- Where is she?
- Where's who?

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:19.890
Miss Frazil.

01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:21.810
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:23.850
- What have you done with her?
- Nothing.

01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:25.370
Get him dressed.

01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:27.410
Morse, with me.

01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:29.770
Show me where you found those footprints.

01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:32.160
Maybe he's got her down there.

01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:36.300
Miss Frazil?

01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:39.420
Miss Frazil?

01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:42.660
Miss Frazil?

01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:49.130
Morse?

01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:52.180
Morse! Miss Knight's handbag!

01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:06.930
"RXN. Check Meat."

01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:10.060
"Rook takes knight. Check Mate."

01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:13.460
It's not Gibbs.

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:30.890
- You think Dr Castle is the
Leighton-Asbury boy? - Yes.

01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:34.330
After his sister killed herself, he
went to his grandparents in Scotland.

01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:36.730
- Their name was King.
- How does that get you to Castle?

01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:38.810
What he wrote on the
wall. Rook takes Knight.

01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:40.970
Rook is the proper name
for the chess piece,

01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:42.690
only some people call it a Castle.

01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:46.330
The fly, the Vicar's Bitch.
That referred to Miss Palfrey.

01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:49.370
- What about "Denial"?
- It wasn't Denial, it was Daniel,

01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:51.970
for Edison Daniel Smalls.
See, Castle's word-blind.

01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:55.010
That's why he mistyped "Rude
Dram" for "Read Drum".

01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:58.130
The envelopes in the locker
were mail. The Oxford Mail.

01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:00.570
He's been telling us his
next move at each instance.

01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:03.050
He must know we've found
the house in Binsey.

01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:06.500
What about the boat house
where his sister drowned?

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:20.010
- What's his motive?
- Miss Palfrey he knew as a child.

01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:23.250
Same as Edison Smalls. Perhaps it
was something to do with his sister.

01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:27.370
You sit in your offices
writing your stories.

01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:29.860
- Ruining lives.
- My God!

01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:33.530
You're him. You're Alexander.

01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:35.770
Well, I'm flattered you remember me.

01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:37.930
I remember you, of course.

01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:41.010
The disgusting insinuations
you made after the inquest.

01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:43.050
- I wrote the truth.
- I loved my sister.

01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:46.290
Well, she didn't love you. Not
in the way you wanted her to.

01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:49.130
She was afraid of you.
You're why she killed herself.

01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:50.850
- Enough!
- I'm not afraid.

01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:54.700
Oh, you will be, in the end.

01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:06.010
I think that's him.

01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:42.890
Get after him! I'll take care of her.

01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:45.750
It's all right! I'll get you out!

01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:48.530
Please, open the door!

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:51.760
Fred!

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.200
Fred!

01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:58.490
- Fred!
- I'm not leaving you.

01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:00.050
- Argh!
- It's OK. Don't worry.

01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:01.700
Fred, please!

01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:11.380
Out you get! Quick!

01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:02.500
If she wanted you dead, you would be.

01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:07.060
- Who?
- Penelope!

01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:15.250
Penelope's dead.

01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:17.500
Your sister, she's dead.

01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:20.850
I just found her again!

01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:24.900
After all that time, I
can't let it happen again!

01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:31.530
You're ill.

01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:33.810
You've had... You've had a breakdown,

01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:36.410
and Dr Neilsen knew it.

01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:42.010
He was going to tell Dr Amory,
have you taken off the project.

01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:46.220
- That's why you killed him.
- I had to. I had to kill Neilsen.

01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.490
She spoke to me.

01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:52.340
Through the computer, through JASON.

01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:56.740
If I lost JASON, I would
have lost Penelope too.

01:23:58.220 --> 01:24:00.450
And the death masks, what were they?

01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:03.010
I made them for Penelope as an offering,

01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:05.530
so she could see I had
done what she asked.

01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:08.970
I know it sounds mad, but
we're meant to be together.

01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:11.020
Always.

01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:20.850
I'm not mad.

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.200
(No, I'm not mad.)

01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:26.840
God knows I should be, growing up here.

01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:40.180
It was a house of monsters.

01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:45.020
But the men who came to visit
your father were heroes, as was he.

01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:49.360
The only monster in that house was you.

01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:56.330
I read your sister's diary.

01:24:56.380 --> 01:24:58.730
- She was terrified of you.
- I'd never hurt Penelope!

01:24:58.780 --> 01:25:00.690
The only way to get away was by drowning!

01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:02.690
She drowned herself to get away from you.

01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:05.080
- You forced her to it.
- No.

01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:08.530
Look, anyway, it's finished. It's over.

01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:11.660
- Put the bricks down, it's done.
- None of it matters now.

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:14.880
I just want Penelope back.

01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:18.860
I miss her so much.

01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:33.160
Now I know what I've got
to do to get her back.

01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:12.450
Breathe. Breathe.

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.440
Breathe, you bastard!

01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:42.250
It was in Tessa Knight's handbag.

01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:44.980
Beyond hurting her now.

01:26:46.620 --> 01:26:48.610
It's evidence.

01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:52.100
Castle'll get what he's got
coming, with this or without.

01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:57.530
It wouldn't harm your prospects any if you
found it'd slipped down the back of your sofa.

01:26:57.580 --> 01:26:59.290
But that wouldn't be true.

01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:02.500
You don't have to stay in Oxford.

01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:07.480
You have to make a stand somewhere.

01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:11.530
They're not going to drive me out.

01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:13.970
You two done, is it?

01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:16.980
All right for some.

01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:21.820
Can I give you a lift?

01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:36.300
Well, this is very nice, I must say.

01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:42.180
I don't suppose there's any word?

01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:45.460
No. No word.
