00:49.258 --> 00:50.801
<i>I couldn't feel pain.</i>

00:51.802 --> 00:55.597
<i>I couldn't sense time.</i>
<i>I couldn't understand where I was.</i>

00:56.514 --> 00:57.766
<i>But I could see.</i>

00:58.976 --> 00:59.977
<i>I could see.</i>

01:02.020 --> 01:05.858
<i>I remembered Homer and Rachel</i>
<i>and Scott screaming my name.</i>

01:06.775 --> 01:08.360
<i>They were no longer with me.</i>

01:09.277 --> 01:13.406
<i>The sudden rush of loss made me realize</i>
<i>that for the second time in my life...</i>

01:15.158 --> 01:16.451
<i>I was dead.</i>

02:26.021 --> 02:29.357
Khatun... I can see.

02:29.441 --> 02:32.110
You could always see, my child.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.698
Catch your breath and join me.

02:48.752 --> 02:50.462
I'm not supposed to be here.

02:50.545 --> 02:54.132
Nonsense.
You've had so much time.

02:54.758 --> 02:58.220
Look at you, a young woman now.

02:59.512 --> 03:01.681
It's a mistake, Khatun.

03:01.765 --> 03:07.813
If you stay, there is no more suffering.
All the pain of life, gone.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.607
Soon, you won't remember any of it.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.028
But I don't want to forget.

03:15.112 --> 03:18.198
They're with him in that basement.
I can't leave them there.

03:19.199 --> 03:22.285
You're strange. I respect it.

03:25.705 --> 03:29.292
But as things are... you never escape.

03:35.924 --> 03:41.679
All your courage...
and planning, not enough.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.518
I see you're hungry.

03:48.812 --> 03:50.480
I'll fish for you.

03:58.030 --> 04:02.409
This... will show you a way
to another place...

04:03.576 --> 04:05.996
a form of travel unknown to humans.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.708
Without it,
you will stay a prisoner forever.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.588
It takes a lot of practice...

04:16.965 --> 04:21.553
but with this... you may one day fly free.

04:24.556 --> 04:28.811
If I give it to you... there's a price.

04:31.646 --> 04:33.023
A fair trade.

04:46.744 --> 04:47.955
Papa.

04:49.331 --> 04:50.498
Papa!

04:51.416 --> 04:52.667
Here!

04:54.252 --> 04:55.712
Papa!

04:57.255 --> 04:59.424
-He can't hear me.
-No, he cannot.

05:00.342 --> 05:01.509
But he could.

05:02.635 --> 05:06.473
You can go with your father
and be in painless peace together...

05:07.515 --> 05:11.561
or you can take the bird
and find out who you really are.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.565
That isn't a fair choice.

05:15.648 --> 05:19.820
To exist... is to survive unfair choices.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.372
Join him.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.416
He's right outside waiting for you.

05:57.732 --> 05:59.484
How do I get back to the others?

06:07.034 --> 06:09.119
Now you know sacrifice.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.874
Now you are ready
for what comes with this gift.

06:19.254 --> 06:20.672
Swallow it.

06:20.755 --> 06:22.966
It's the seed of light.

06:23.050 --> 06:26.719
If you grow it, all you need to know
will be inside you.

06:28.596 --> 06:33.893
All five of you must work together as one
to avert a great evil.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.562
There's only four of us.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.230
You will see.

06:39.649 --> 06:42.902
Khatun... am I like you?

06:42.986 --> 06:44.862
No.

06:44.946 --> 06:46.740
You are the original.

06:48.951 --> 06:49.952
Be quick.

06:50.910 --> 06:51.954
Eat it.

07:37.332 --> 07:41.795
<i>I knew from the moment I woke up</i>
<i>that life was no longer the same.</i>

07:44.839 --> 07:47.842
<i>I had given up eternity with my father</i>

07:47.925 --> 07:50.887
<i>for a promise I made</i>
<i>to people I barely knew.</i>

07:54.391 --> 07:55.517
Here.

08:00.355 --> 08:01.648
I thought I'd lost you.

08:03.441 --> 08:04.901
Glad you recovered.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.281
How does it feel?

08:12.117 --> 08:14.202
-My head hurts.
-That's my fault.

08:15.245 --> 08:19.124
You were... at the edge of the mine.
I wasn't thinking. I'm sorry.

08:21.376 --> 08:22.377
Here.

08:23.711 --> 08:25.713
You were gone a long time.

08:25.797 --> 08:28.091
No pulse for seven minutes.
Utterly unresponsive.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.342
It's the only...

08:29.926 --> 08:31.803
nonscientific death I've ever had.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.888
Here.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.516
I was worried about you.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.978
I've been doing this study for years.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.441
And you're the only...

08:45.066 --> 08:48.653
subject who's ever challenged me.

08:48.736 --> 08:52.657
Extracted concessions, tried to escape.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.370
You, blind, have done all three.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.165
The others?

09:01.041 --> 09:03.043
How did you find the others?

09:03.752 --> 09:06.296
Well, you were a happy accident.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.799
But, the others... Well, the others...

09:10.675 --> 09:12.135
I had to hunt down.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.976
I'm sorry about the violence outside.

09:21.686 --> 09:25.648
But you should know... I can't let you go.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.151
Aah!

09:32.197 --> 09:33.490
I can't.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.023
<i>Khatun had fed me a mystery.</i>

10:07.857 --> 10:11.111
<i>I couldn't understand it,</i>
<i>but I could feel it inside me.</i>

10:11.194 --> 10:14.197
<i>A clue, a bomb, a Hail Mary.</i>

10:31.673 --> 10:33.633
Prair, can you hear me?

10:35.677 --> 10:36.844
You okay?

10:39.639 --> 10:42.559
You almost did it. You almost got away.

10:47.605 --> 10:50.525
- Homer? I have to tell--
- It doesn't matter.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.694
It's okay. You're alive.

10:52.777 --> 10:56.656
Doesn't matter?
I'd kinda like to get the fuck outta here.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.741
I knew it was a long shot.

11:10.962 --> 11:15.467
I got through these... woods to an edge.

11:17.344 --> 11:20.263
He hit me in the back of the head...

11:21.097 --> 11:22.182
hard.

11:26.185 --> 11:27.729
I died.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.022
Probably you passed out from the pain.

11:31.983 --> 11:33.651
I went somewhere...

11:36.654 --> 11:38.240
and I saw her.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.950
The same woman I saw
when I was a little girl.

11:43.745 --> 11:45.663
Oh, my God.

11:46.414 --> 11:49.751
Oh, we've been going about this all wrong.
We've been trying to get out.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.504
Yes. Well, that's kinda the big idea.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.005
No.

11:55.257 --> 11:57.467
We have to try to get in.

12:02.597 --> 12:04.599
I think she got brain damage.

12:04.682 --> 12:07.810
We've been acting like lab rats.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.773
Lab rats are only powerless

12:11.856 --> 12:15.527
because they don't understand
that they're in an experiment.

12:16.861 --> 12:20.948
But they're just as much a part of it
as the scientist, in some ways even more.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.493
See, we could take it over.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.079
His experiment is our way out.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.665
No, no.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.709
I... I don't know
what that psychopathic fuck is doing,

12:31.793 --> 12:33.044
and I don't want to know.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.672
Listen. She's trying to say something.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.715
But how would we know, though?

12:37.799 --> 12:39.634
The gas. We don't remember anything.

12:39.717 --> 12:42.136
He's made it that way on purpose.

12:42.219 --> 12:43.555
Yeah, he's got all the power.

12:43.638 --> 12:45.097
Look...

12:50.061 --> 12:53.439
We all died... and we all chose to return.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.567
No, no, speak for your own self.

12:55.650 --> 12:59.070
We all touched another side
and came back different.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.950
When you listen to Rachel sing,
don't you feel it?

13:06.786 --> 13:08.913
- In my bones.
- Yeah.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.667
We aren't captives.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.919
We aren't lab rats.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.590
We aren't unloved or unlucky.

13:29.684 --> 13:31.310
We're angels.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.564
Oh, God.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.567
Honestly...

13:37.650 --> 13:39.235
...go fuck yourself.

13:56.043 --> 13:57.253
Angels?

13:58.337 --> 14:00.047
How do you know?

14:03.092 --> 14:05.261
Because even in your grief,
you protected me

14:05.344 --> 14:08.305
from finding out about August's death
before I was ready.

14:11.934 --> 14:14.646
Because I hear you whispering
to your plants at night

14:14.729 --> 14:17.106
to make them grow without the sun.

14:29.285 --> 14:31.996
Because your eyes are green...

14:32.872 --> 14:36.125
clear... as honest as you are.

14:40.171 --> 14:43.174
Because I can see.

14:52.183 --> 14:53.976
Oh...

14:59.399 --> 15:01.317
I wish I'd met you sooner...

15:02.444 --> 15:04.361
so you could have known him.

15:04.446 --> 15:05.488
Me, too.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.907
-My brother Theo.
-I know.

15:11.243 --> 15:13.120
Oh... Go.

15:14.288 --> 15:17.500
Yeah, go. It's important you're not late.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.335
Will you let the boys
walk you to your car?

15:20.086 --> 15:21.170
Yes.

15:53.870 --> 15:54.954
Good night.

15:58.165 --> 16:01.669
Thank you.
Um... do you need a ride home?

16:03.087 --> 16:05.590
We live here.

16:25.610 --> 16:29.572
<i>It's Rod Spence again.</i>
<i>Sorry to call so many times, but, uh,</i>

16:29.656 --> 16:34.118
<i>you really, uh, need to get in touch,</i>
<i>so we can go over everything.</i>

16:34.201 --> 16:36.287
<i>Um... please call me back.</i>

16:36.370 --> 16:39.206
<i>Uh, it's about your...</i>
<i>your brother's will, as you know.</i>

16:39.290 --> 16:41.042
<i>Um, my number is... You have...</i>

16:41.125 --> 16:43.419
<i>Well, you have my number. Just call me.</i>

17:17.662 --> 17:20.832
Oh. Hey, Ali.
What're you doing up?

17:20.915 --> 17:22.792
Couldn't sleep.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.169
Hey, you didn't notice
the door was open?

17:25.252 --> 17:28.631
- Oh, that's why it's so cold.
- Yeah, yeah.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.300
Wanna?

17:31.383 --> 17:34.220
Oh, nah, nah, it'll just fuck
with my head even more.

17:37.890 --> 17:41.060
You hang with sexy blind girl again?
The fourth time in a row?

17:41.143 --> 17:42.728
Fuck off.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.522
Third.

17:45.607 --> 17:48.359
Saw Maureen today.

17:48.442 --> 17:49.652
Oh, Mustache Maureen?

17:50.361 --> 17:51.738
What? No.

17:51.821 --> 17:53.364
Oh. Maureen who?

17:55.199 --> 17:57.409
Yeah, Mustache Maureen,
I just don't call her that.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.411
Okay.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.123
She came by to drop off some stuff...

18:02.999 --> 18:04.125
watched a movie.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.211
You should hang with us next time.

18:07.295 --> 18:08.879
She's really into Kubrick.

18:09.463 --> 18:10.881
Yeah, what's Kubrick?

18:21.350 --> 18:23.936
- She keeps you guys out late.
- We want to.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.106
You guys hang out
with the little trans one at school, too?

18:27.189 --> 18:29.692
No, mostly just with the others
at the house.

18:31.027 --> 18:33.195
She better not be some giant blind creep.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.822
Okay, look, she's not even blind anymore.

18:34.906 --> 18:37.074
God, just joking.

19:01.682 --> 19:04.352
-Hey, Ali?
-What?

19:06.354 --> 19:08.648
Do... Do you believe in angels?

19:09.273 --> 19:12.694
What, is Steve, like,
all Christian now or something?

19:13.569 --> 19:14.612
What?

19:15.279 --> 19:19.408
I don't know, aren't his parents, like...
sending him to Christian boot camp?

19:19.491 --> 19:21.953
-Asheville?
-Yeah, no, no, it's not like that.

19:22.036 --> 19:22.995
Like what?

19:25.832 --> 19:27.208
Well, like Mom. Do...

19:29.710 --> 19:31.587
Do you think she could have been an angel?

19:32.213 --> 19:33.547
Like, a real angel?

19:34.215 --> 19:36.467
I don't think angels commit suicide.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.013
Right.

19:41.723 --> 19:42.932
Yeah.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.602
But what do I know, you know?

19:51.232 --> 19:55.527
So, the estate needs to reimburse your mom
for the funeral.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.404
She'd like that to happen soon.

19:57.488 --> 19:59.448
-I'm sure she does.
-Sign here.

19:59.531 --> 20:02.576
She's still angry
that I didn't go to the funeral.

20:02.659 --> 20:05.579
You know, she had
this idealized relationship with him.

20:05.662 --> 20:08.082
He could do no wrong.

20:08.165 --> 20:11.460
-Moms can be that way with sons.
-Yep.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.462
You know, he was my twin.

20:13.545 --> 20:16.632
And it's true what they say,
there's a connection.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.801
I, uh, I broke it.

20:21.721 --> 20:25.224
We, uh, need to settle
with the rehab facility as well.

20:25.307 --> 20:28.811
This form authorizes the estate
to pay Lakeview.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.646
-Hmm.
-They want to know if you'll be gathering

20:30.730 --> 20:32.564
his personal effects
or if they should just--

20:32.648 --> 20:34.275
Don't let 'em throw anything away.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.652
Then I suggest you get over there
as soon as possible.

20:36.736 --> 20:41.073
Okay, I'll get a U-Haul
or maybe I can find someone with a truck.

20:41.157 --> 20:43.450
If you get a U-Haul, get a receipt.

20:43.534 --> 20:45.702
Your brother had excellent life insurance.

20:48.122 --> 20:52.794
Now, once our, uh, billing is deducted
and court fees are paid,

20:52.877 --> 20:54.545
you should still see a substantial sum.

20:58.966 --> 21:01.343
Did you not read your copy of the will?

21:01.427 --> 21:05.139
Rod, um, I turned
my own brother in to the police

21:05.222 --> 21:08.267
and they forced him into rehab
and now he's dead.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.770
No, I did not read his will.

21:12.354 --> 21:13.981
He left you everything.

21:14.065 --> 21:16.650
After expenses, it all goes to you.

21:16.733 --> 21:18.110
Fifty thousand dollars.

21:23.032 --> 21:24.241
Hmm.

21:38.297 --> 21:41.467
I think I should go back to work
sooner rather than later.

21:41.550 --> 21:42.885
Think it'll help.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.014
Okay.

21:53.729 --> 21:57.233
Jamie's mother went back to work.
It really helped.

21:58.275 --> 22:00.111
Is he the boy in the book?

22:00.194 --> 22:03.364
-Yes, from her book.
-Okay.

22:04.115 --> 22:05.741
If you think it's a good idea.

22:06.450 --> 22:10.496
Abel... we... we need the money.

22:10.579 --> 22:15.334
What if she wants to have those...
those terrible scars removed?

22:15.417 --> 22:17.628
What about college, technical school?

22:19.046 --> 22:20.965
We don't have anything saved.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.799
We made the right choice.

22:24.760 --> 22:28.264
If we're not on her side,
whose side are we on?

22:30.641 --> 22:31.893
You keep reading.

22:33.895 --> 22:36.563
I'll take Prairie
to meet the FBI counselor.

23:16.187 --> 23:18.897
Hey, look, chill with the horn, dude.

23:18.981 --> 23:20.816
Okay? You shouldn't even be driving.
You know how Ali is.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.411
Okay, you know what?
Shut up, dude!

23:32.494 --> 23:33.787
Yo, where you goin'?

23:34.871 --> 23:35.872
I'm not gettin' squeezed.

23:35.957 --> 23:37.499
So you're gonna
let the old lady get squeezed?

23:37.583 --> 23:39.293
Are you high? Dude, come on.

23:39.376 --> 23:40.877
Okay. I'm coming, I'm coming.

23:42.671 --> 23:44.840
Oh. Thanks for this.

23:44.923 --> 23:48.427
I didn't know who else to call...
I mean, with a truck.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.012
Would you take that, please?

23:53.099 --> 23:54.683
Okay. Oh!

23:57.436 --> 23:58.980
It's a really big step.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.529
I appreciate this.

24:07.613 --> 24:09.073
-You ready?
-Yeah.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.993
Clear a path!

25:06.422 --> 25:08.382
He loved that stuff!

25:08.465 --> 25:09.299
What?

25:09.967 --> 25:13.095
He... Just turn it... Turn it down.

25:15.139 --> 25:18.767
You're gonna make everyone in the building
start using heroin again.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.978
Wait, this is a rehab place for heroin?

25:22.063 --> 25:23.564
No, I was just making a...

25:25.274 --> 25:26.275
a joke.

25:32.698 --> 25:36.535
Theo... he loved this movie.

25:38.162 --> 25:40.372
<i>The Incredible Mr. Limpet.</i>

25:40.456 --> 25:42.124
Don Knotts plays a...

25:43.084 --> 25:45.794
You have no idea who Don Knotts is.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.965
He was this weird little man.

25:50.048 --> 25:53.219
And in the movie,
he turns into a fish.

25:54.428 --> 25:57.181
It was, uh, half a cartoon.

25:57.264 --> 25:59.891
Probably awful, but...

25:59.975 --> 26:02.603
he loved it, so I loved it.

26:03.520 --> 26:07.399
We, uh... We swore we'd turn into otters

26:07.483 --> 26:09.276
when we got older.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.027
Just like Mr. Limpet.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.781
Theo said that otters had the life.

26:15.991 --> 26:17.409
Playing and...

26:18.619 --> 26:20.412
eating all day.

26:21.997 --> 26:24.458
Maybe he became an otter after all.

26:26.460 --> 26:27.794
I just got old.

26:29.129 --> 26:30.297
You're not old.

26:31.132 --> 26:33.008
Old enough to be your parent.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.677
Probably older. They're in their 40s?

26:37.679 --> 26:41.350
Um, my mom would be 45 in January,

26:41.433 --> 26:43.394
and my dad would be...

26:45.187 --> 26:46.647
Yeah, I'm not sure. Like, 47?

26:46.730 --> 26:49.441
Oh, sweetie. I didn't know they passed.

26:51.235 --> 26:53.028
Yeah, my mom, not my dad.

26:54.363 --> 26:55.197
He left?

26:59.034 --> 27:02.120
Yeah, for the longest time I thought
he must've been better than us, somehow.

27:02.204 --> 27:03.705
No. Not better.

27:04.415 --> 27:06.250
Just different.

27:07.709 --> 27:09.836
Yeah, I guess that's what I mean.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.590
That some people don't belong in a family.

27:14.550 --> 27:17.135
Like, they don't know what it is.
How to be...

27:18.429 --> 27:20.013
helped by it.

27:20.681 --> 27:21.932
Mmm.

27:22.015 --> 27:25.227
I mean, I'm not... I'm not saying
that Theo was like that, I just--

27:25.311 --> 27:28.605
No, no.
Maybe you are, and maybe you're right.

27:28.689 --> 27:29.898
Yeah.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.235
Yo, BBA!

27:37.198 --> 27:38.282
Oh.

27:42.536 --> 27:44.079
You look, uh...

27:45.581 --> 27:47.291
You look very...

27:48.250 --> 27:49.585
Very, uh...

27:50.335 --> 27:51.253
Nice?

27:52.796 --> 27:53.964
Yeah.

27:54.923 --> 27:57.092
Very, very nice.

28:01.472 --> 28:03.432
<i>It was a horrible experience.</i>

28:03.515 --> 28:05.976
That's not exactly what I asked.

28:07.353 --> 28:08.854
Oh, you want to know what happened?

28:08.937 --> 28:11.940
Eventually.
For now I'm just curious how you feel.

28:13.900 --> 28:15.986
It's not a trick question. Promise.

28:20.324 --> 28:22.158
Like I'm still a prisoner.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.078
I understand.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.707
Can you think of the emotion
that goes with that?

28:28.790 --> 28:30.709
Angry. Really angry.

28:30.792 --> 28:33.211
-You don't want to be here?
-No.

28:33.295 --> 28:35.088
Hmm. Me neither.

28:35.171 --> 28:37.716
I mean,
this bland office crap puts me to sleep.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.427
You wanna take a walk?

28:52.648 --> 28:55.984
I mean, I guess
I became an agent to catch the bad guys.

28:56.067 --> 28:58.445
That's always been the FBI's focus,
the perpetrator.

28:59.363 --> 29:02.115
But, uh... the more cases I worked,

29:02.198 --> 29:05.994
the more I realized that, you know,
the punishment never really mattered,

29:06.077 --> 29:07.371
or it was never enough.

29:07.454 --> 29:10.832
No one was thinking about the victims,
mainly women and children.

29:12.376 --> 29:14.670
A few of us started
the Victim Support Program,

29:14.753 --> 29:17.839
and it feels good. It feels satisfying.

29:19.007 --> 29:22.093
Impacting people's lives
without shooting at them.

29:25.556 --> 29:28.141
What if I told you
I'm trying to help people?

29:29.476 --> 29:31.186
I would say that's a noble impulse.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.896
Without knowing the details?

29:34.147 --> 29:36.608
Might be I do know, in a way.

29:36.692 --> 29:39.320
I don't think so.

29:40.904 --> 29:43.865
Well, you weren't alone there.
Somehow you got out.

29:43.949 --> 29:46.410
You want to rescue the others,
but you're afraid if you tell us,

29:46.493 --> 29:47.869
they might get killed?

29:50.831 --> 29:52.458
If I told you anything close to the truth,

29:52.541 --> 29:55.251
you'd think I was a crazy person
and you'd have me locked up.

29:56.587 --> 29:59.548
Well, look, I'm not here as a field agent.
I'm not here to solve any crimes.

29:59.631 --> 30:02.718
I'm just here to help you
process your experience.

30:04.761 --> 30:06.680
I mean, if you tell me something
that could help the Bureau

30:06.763 --> 30:08.432
find who did this to you,
I'll pass that on.

30:08.515 --> 30:11.768
But apart from that,
I'm not here for them. I'm here for you.

30:11.852 --> 30:13.228
So what do you think I should do?

30:16.357 --> 30:20.026
First, have compassion... for yourself.

30:20.110 --> 30:23.989
You've been through something
no one is equipped to deal with.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.324
Admit that.

30:26.282 --> 30:28.577
And second...

30:28.660 --> 30:30.704
...just simplify your life.

30:30.787 --> 30:33.374
Same way you would
if you'd been in a car crash or...

30:33.457 --> 30:35.376
You just gotta take the time
you need to heal.

30:35.459 --> 30:37.085
I can't do that.

30:37.168 --> 30:40.046
I understand, more than you know.

30:40.130 --> 30:43.383
But to even think about rescue,
before you've recovered--

30:43.467 --> 30:45.051
What would you do
if I just leave right now?

30:45.135 --> 30:46.803
Do you tell the FBI that?

30:48.555 --> 30:50.057
Our sessions are confidential.

30:50.724 --> 30:54.436
You can walk away, you can push me
in the pond if you want to.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.982
But I hope you don't.
I hope you come back tomorrow.

31:01.151 --> 31:03.236
It's up to you. You're in charge.

31:05.406 --> 31:06.948
You're not a prisoner.

31:12.788 --> 31:14.205
Maybe I'll see you.

31:31.557 --> 31:32.849
It doesn't make sense.

31:32.933 --> 31:35.226
Just 'cause it doesn't make sense,
doesn't mean it's not real.

31:35.310 --> 31:37.438
Lots of shit
doesn't make sense, man.

31:37.521 --> 31:40.106
Don't be a douche. OA wouldn't say
she's an angel and then vanish.

31:40.190 --> 31:42.401
No, that's exactly what an angel would do.

31:45.654 --> 31:48.782
Homer told me
his football coach once said to him,

31:48.865 --> 31:52.786
"Knowledge is a rumor
until it lives in the body."

31:52.869 --> 31:55.997
Which took me a while to figure out.
It's like...

31:56.790 --> 32:00.001
you don't really know something
until your body knows it.

32:01.044 --> 32:03.714
See, Khatun had given me a gift.

32:03.797 --> 32:07.342
It was like a living riddle,
alive inside my body.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.803
I could feel it in my muscles.

32:11.513 --> 32:13.932
I had told the others what we were,

32:14.015 --> 32:18.228
what he was,
what I thought we had to do to break free.

32:19.855 --> 32:24.359
But a whole week passed before
a clear plan began to form in our minds.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.402
There's no way to understand
what he's doing to us

32:26.487 --> 32:27.946
if we don't stay awake.

32:28.572 --> 32:31.199
- We can't stay awake if we get gassed.
- No way.

32:31.282 --> 32:33.201
I'm not poisoning
my fuckin' lungs for you. Sorry.

32:33.284 --> 32:34.327
Scott...

32:34.410 --> 32:36.162
He gasses you every few months anyway.

32:36.246 --> 32:38.081
Exactly. And I'm not killin' myself faster

32:38.164 --> 32:40.000
than I'm already dyin'
for your shit plan--

32:40.083 --> 32:42.377
You wouldn't be alone.
And it would only be half.

32:42.461 --> 32:44.921
The only way out
is through the experiment, Scott.

32:45.005 --> 32:46.590
- Oh, my God.
- She's the one offering

32:46.673 --> 32:48.467
- to do the hard part.
- Crazy is contagious.

32:48.550 --> 32:50.218
I don't fucking understand you.

32:50.301 --> 32:52.971
I thought you were the one
with some goddamn sense.

33:13.408 --> 33:14.618
Let's go.

33:16.077 --> 33:17.037
Come on.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.641
There's a chair right behind you.

33:38.725 --> 33:39.935
Okay.

33:41.436 --> 33:44.231
I'm just attaching a small microphone.

33:45.148 --> 33:49.570
I'm gonna ask you some questions
about your recent NDE.

33:49.653 --> 33:50.987
All right?

33:52.739 --> 33:54.032
I don't...

33:54.950 --> 33:58.995
generally bother
with subjective testimony,

33:59.079 --> 34:01.414
but you, Prairie, have proved to be...

34:02.332 --> 34:05.752
extraordinary in so many areas
that I am optimistic.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.296
Now...

34:08.964 --> 34:10.340
I'm holding...

34:11.675 --> 34:15.846
the sensor that I showed you
the night we met, remember?

34:16.847 --> 34:20.350
So, I will know if you're lying.

34:22.102 --> 34:24.646
So, let's just ask some simple questions

34:24.729 --> 34:27.440
to calibrate the machine.
Where were you born?

34:27.524 --> 34:28.483
Russia.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.611
And what's your favorite food?

34:32.112 --> 34:33.113
Pretzels.

34:35.782 --> 34:39.995
And did you go blind as a result of an NDE
when you were a child?

34:40.078 --> 34:41.121
Yes.

34:43.624 --> 34:45.083
Okay, perfect.

34:48.169 --> 34:52.507
So... just tell me everything
you remember from the moment you...

34:52.591 --> 34:53.842
The moment of your death.

34:53.925 --> 34:57.345
When I hit you with the gun
to when you came around. All right?

35:01.224 --> 35:02.350
I can't.

35:03.059 --> 35:04.310
Prairie.

35:08.064 --> 35:10.984
Prairie, listen to me.

35:11.067 --> 35:14.237
This is important work
and I need you to collaborate with me,

35:14.320 --> 35:16.281
or I will be forced to be...

35:17.198 --> 35:21.745
very unkind to you and the others
in ways that you won't enjoy...

35:22.788 --> 35:25.540
and we will both regret.
You understand me?

35:25.624 --> 35:27.542
Yeah, I'm... I'm just... There's just...

35:27.626 --> 35:29.836
I don't know how to talk about it.
It just...

35:29.920 --> 35:31.421
There aren't words.

35:32.380 --> 35:35.967
Couldn't you just ask me what it is
that you wanna know and I'll answer it?

35:38.136 --> 35:39.470
All right.

35:40.096 --> 35:41.556
All right, let's do that.

35:43.599 --> 35:44.768
So...

35:45.936 --> 35:47.353
was there sunshine?

35:49.064 --> 35:51.149
No, but there was light.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.652
Were you outdoors?

35:54.903 --> 35:56.612
No, uh, for a moment.

35:57.698 --> 35:59.115
Mmm-hmm.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.617
Could you see?

36:02.661 --> 36:06.206
Yes, but...
it wasn't how I remember sight.

36:08.541 --> 36:10.669
And was there sound?

36:12.045 --> 36:13.213
Wind.

36:15.298 --> 36:17.425
Colors? The color blue?

36:17.508 --> 36:19.135
No.

36:22.013 --> 36:24.057
And how did you feel?

36:25.726 --> 36:27.227
Were you sad?

36:28.269 --> 36:31.314
No. But I wasn't happy.

36:34.234 --> 36:36.069
At any point was there a...

36:36.862 --> 36:39.740
sense of euphoria or...

36:40.949 --> 36:42.158
Peace.

36:43.744 --> 36:47.330
I had to fight that peace... to come back.

36:47.413 --> 36:48.957
But... To come back?

36:49.040 --> 36:51.376
I mean, when you...
When you came back, that...

36:51.459 --> 36:53.336
You chose that. That was your choice?

36:54.004 --> 36:55.213
Yes.

36:58.425 --> 36:59.676
Was there anyone there?

37:05.390 --> 37:06.474
Prairie?

37:07.433 --> 37:09.728
-Were you alone?
-No. No.

37:09.811 --> 37:12.772
A person? I mean, uh...
There was another person there?

37:15.608 --> 37:17.068
Someone...

37:18.153 --> 37:19.946
who's not alive in this world?

37:21.406 --> 37:22.824
My father.

37:24.409 --> 37:25.952
And, uh...

37:27.412 --> 37:30.791
How was he? Was he...
Was he, uh... Was he different?

37:30.874 --> 37:34.127
Did he, uh... Was he changed?
Clothes, hair, speech?

37:34.210 --> 37:37.588
I don't know 'cause I didn't get
a chance to speak to him, but...

37:39.299 --> 37:43.845
He looked the same as I remember,
from when I was a little girl.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.474
It was me.

37:49.434 --> 37:50.852
I was different.

38:05.575 --> 38:06.576
And...

38:07.660 --> 38:08.787
here we go.

38:19.255 --> 38:21.132
<i>Hap's interrogation of me made it clear</i>

38:21.216 --> 38:24.302
<i>we had to find out</i>
<i>what his experiment was.</i>

38:24.385 --> 38:26.554
<i>But the gas made us forget everything.</i>

38:27.472 --> 38:29.515
<i>If Scott and Homer</i>
<i>used their lung power</i>

38:29.599 --> 38:32.102
<i>to suck the gas out of my cell</i>
<i>from either side,</i>

38:32.185 --> 38:35.355
<i>I could stay awake and learn</i>
<i>what Hap was doing to us.</i>

38:36.940 --> 38:38.399
What did he say to you?

38:38.483 --> 38:41.527
He is stumbling around in the dark.

38:41.611 --> 38:43.529
And he is gonna keep us here forever.

38:45.866 --> 38:48.869
Scott... will you please help?

38:49.785 --> 38:51.537
What's the worst it can be?

38:51.621 --> 38:55.041
-Pain? Terror? Shock?
-Exactly.

38:55.125 --> 38:58.294
You faced all of those things
when you first got here and you survived.

38:58.378 --> 39:01.756
- How many times do I have to tell you no?
- Look, I'm scared, too.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.508
I don't know if I'm strong enough either.

39:03.591 --> 39:06.136
If I'm gonna break, or beg, or cry.

39:07.137 --> 39:10.556
All I know is he is not insane,
he is obsessed.

39:10.640 --> 39:13.935
I ain't sucking any more poison
into my lungs than I have to.

39:14.019 --> 39:16.146
And I don't give a shit
if you think I'm going to hell for that.

39:16.229 --> 39:17.438
Then he wins.

39:18.273 --> 39:20.066
We die prisoners.

39:20.150 --> 39:22.693
You don't think I fucking know that?

39:24.946 --> 39:26.781
Yeah, we were all taken.

39:29.159 --> 39:31.077
But y'all were taken healthy.

39:32.162 --> 39:33.413
Not me.

39:35.123 --> 39:36.791
I'll bet he's comin' for me next,

39:36.875 --> 39:39.127
so I'll see the three of you
on the other side.

39:42.547 --> 39:43.882
Maybe you could be healed.

39:45.133 --> 39:47.093
She got her sight back.

39:47.177 --> 39:50.055
She got hit in the head, Rachel.

39:50.138 --> 39:51.306
Hard.

40:02.733 --> 40:04.527
Rachel, would you swallow gas?

40:06.154 --> 40:07.363
Yeah.

40:10.158 --> 40:11.534
What about you?

40:13.703 --> 40:14.996
Yeah?

40:16.915 --> 40:18.291
So I'll go.

40:20.626 --> 40:22.878
I don't even have to pretend to be blind.

40:29.052 --> 40:31.804
I couldn't see the pain it caused Scott...

40:31.887 --> 40:33.806
to have to just sit back and watch.

40:34.765 --> 40:37.310
To not feel the rush
that bravery gives you,

40:37.393 --> 40:40.521
that high of being part of something
bigger than you are.

40:40.605 --> 40:44.400
I told Homer,
the most important thing was to figure out

40:44.484 --> 40:46.945
what it was that he was taking from us.

40:48.196 --> 40:53.118
But it's one thing to make a plan.
It's another altogether to execute it.

40:53.994 --> 40:56.662
<i>A month passed before he came for Homer.</i>

41:33.033 --> 41:34.492
Prairie? Prairie!

41:37.245 --> 41:38.454
Fuck! Rachel?

41:38.538 --> 41:39.830
What a plan.

42:32.258 --> 42:34.094
So you didn't inhale then?

42:36.679 --> 42:38.389
Rachel fell, she's hurt.

42:42.518 --> 42:45.896
Don't ignore me just 'cause
I won't play mousetrap with you.

42:48.691 --> 42:49.775
Can you hear me?

42:56.616 --> 42:58.451
She's not dead, she's not dead.

43:03.748 --> 43:06.292
Close your fucking eyes
if you're gonna play dead!

43:08.878 --> 43:10.421
Oh, I'm the monster?

43:10.505 --> 43:13.341
You're fuckin' with me
while Rachel's on the floor bleeding out

43:13.424 --> 43:16.094
because of your stupid fucking plan
and I'm the monster?

43:16.886 --> 43:20.014
Open your eyes and tell--

43:20.098 --> 43:22.517
Oh, you're a regular comedienne.

43:23.101 --> 43:25.686
Why don't you stand up
and take a bow for your fans?

43:39.617 --> 43:40.826
Sit down.

43:42.745 --> 43:43.955
Lie down.

43:48.292 --> 43:50.294
Suck your thumb like a baby.

43:57.927 --> 43:59.220
<i>We got lucky.</i>

44:00.138 --> 44:03.224
<i>We thought that the gas</i>
<i>was knocking us out cold.</i>

44:03.308 --> 44:05.893
It wasn't, it was making us compliant.

44:05.976 --> 44:08.479
We would do anything we were told,
and then forget about it.

44:08.563 --> 44:10.231
Oh, yeah, I know that shit.

44:10.315 --> 44:13.108
Girls pass out for, like, five minutes
and then wake up zombies.

44:14.319 --> 44:15.445
What? I've never done it.

44:15.528 --> 44:17.572
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I... I read about that.

44:17.655 --> 44:21.116
A guy in Detroit talked some girl
into emptying out her entire bank account.

44:22.117 --> 44:25.037
Scopolamine.
Some people call it Devil's Breath.

44:25.830 --> 44:27.623
But the plan worked the next time, right?

44:27.707 --> 44:29.959
I mean, you could just
pretend to be zombies?

44:30.042 --> 44:32.378
It took us nearly a year
to get that part right.

44:32.462 --> 44:33.546
A year? Why?

44:33.629 --> 44:35.506
Getting good at something takes time.

44:35.590 --> 44:37.258
You don't think I know that?

44:37.342 --> 44:38.634
I know that.

45:48.496 --> 45:50.039
Step up, Homer.

45:54.585 --> 45:55.961
Up on the platform.

45:56.879 --> 45:58.255
Stay there.

45:59.173 --> 46:03.177
Remove your sweatshirt and T-shirt
and sweatpants and leave them there.

46:09.266 --> 46:10.476
Walk around.

46:12.853 --> 46:15.773
Step around. One foot on either base.

46:15.856 --> 46:17.149
Sit back on the chair.

46:23.280 --> 46:24.281
Raise your right arm.

46:31.205 --> 46:32.415
And your left arm.

46:55.270 --> 46:56.481
Lower your head.

47:09.201 --> 47:10.661
Raise your right foot.

47:13.748 --> 47:14.957
Left foot.

47:21.589 --> 47:23.508
And back on the platform.

47:26.844 --> 47:31.182
There we are. Now, pull your head back,
put your chin down.

47:32.224 --> 47:33.976
And do not move your head.

49:35.347 --> 49:36.307
Homer.

49:41.020 --> 49:42.897
What happened? Homer?

49:46.108 --> 49:47.151
Hmm.

49:47.234 --> 49:51.030
<i>We failed.</i>
<i>Again and again, we failed.</i>

49:55.576 --> 49:57.662
<i>Three years passed.</i>

49:57.745 --> 50:00.706
<i>In that time, I often doubted</i>
<i>I'd ever met Khatun at all.</i>

50:01.874 --> 50:03.501
<i>But Homer never gave up.</i>

50:04.251 --> 50:06.504
<i>He'd seen something of the experiment.</i>

50:06.587 --> 50:10.090
<i>It became a quest for him</i>
<i>to understand what Hap was doing.</i>

50:10.174 --> 50:14.970
<i>He took all the feeling bottled inside him</i>
<i>and channeled it into this mission.</i>

50:15.054 --> 50:19.433
<i>And every time we failed,</i>
<i>Homer came up with a new and better idea.</i>

50:20.935 --> 50:22.603
<i>Raise your right arm.</i>

50:26.732 --> 50:28.317
Bend your right arm.

50:37.660 --> 50:38.869
Don't move.

51:03.894 --> 51:06.731
<i>What we need to do,</i>
<i>what I set out to do,</i>

51:06.814 --> 51:09.191
<i>is find a way to remove</i>
<i>the human component</i>

51:09.274 --> 51:12.111
<i>and gather objective scientific data.</i>

51:12.194 --> 51:15.155
<i>And what... what is inherently...</i>

51:16.949 --> 51:18.868
<i>Doctors used to think that death...</i>

51:18.951 --> 51:22.454
<i>was when the breath stopped</i>
<i>and then we found that that was not true.</i>

51:22.537 --> 51:26.709
<i>And, um, we thought that death</i>
<i>was when the heart stopped beating,</i>

51:26.792 --> 51:28.628
<i>and that was not true, either.</i>

51:28.711 --> 51:31.672
<i>And then, when brain activity ceased,</i>

51:31.756 --> 51:34.216
<i>was for a long time</i>
<i>the definition of death.</i>

51:35.301 --> 51:38.053
<i>And I have realized that there is...</i>

51:38.137 --> 51:39.555
<i>some possibility...</i>

51:39.638 --> 51:42.516
- <i>Hey, you! Stop right there!</i>
<i>- </i><i> ...that audio activity</i>

51:42.600 --> 51:46.103
<i>- can be detected with the right equipment.</i>
<i>- Down here! Down the hall!</i>

51:47.896 --> 51:50.816
<i>Hey, you! Stop!</i>
<i>Stop right there! Where you going?</i>

51:53.110 --> 51:55.195
<i>Stay down. What's your name?</i>

51:55.279 --> 51:57.364
- <i>My name is Homer.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

51:57.448 --> 51:59.825
<i>- </i><i> I'm Homer.</i>
<i>- </i><i> Your name is not Homer.</i>

51:59.909 --> 52:01.576
<i>Look at me.</i>
<i>Do you know Dr. Roberts?</i>

52:01.661 --> 52:02.828
<i>What? No.</i>

52:02.911 --> 52:05.164
<i>- Let me go, please! </i>

52:05.247 --> 52:07.374
<i>Yeah, I know you.</i>

52:08.083 --> 52:09.627
<i>Calm down!</i>

52:09.710 --> 52:11.962
<i>Come quick! Help me get him up!</i>
<i>We need help!</i>

52:12.630 --> 52:17.343
<i>The subjects</i>
<i>generated unreliable data.</i>

52:17.426 --> 52:19.344
<i>The attrition rate was very high.</i>

52:19.428 --> 52:21.889
<i>I lost a lot of subjects.</i>

52:21.972 --> 52:23.474
<i>- </i><i>-And whether they were out</i>

52:23.557 --> 52:24.892
<i>for seconds or moments,</i>

52:24.975 --> 52:27.936
<i>it was always a roll of the dice</i>
<i>whether I could bring them back or not.</i>

52:28.688 --> 52:34.526
<i>Until I realized that those subjects</i>
<i>who had previously experienced an NDE</i>

52:34.609 --> 52:37.446
<i>were far more likely to be revived.</i>

52:37.529 --> 52:42.702
<i>And when I began working exclusively</i>
<i>with near death experience survivors,</i>

52:42.785 --> 52:44.536
<i>the work took off.</i>

52:44.619 --> 52:48.040
<i>They have an almost limitless potential</i>
<i>for being revived.</i>

52:48.123 --> 52:49.166
<i>Now, whether that's...</i>

52:49.249 --> 52:53.587
<i>He was killing us.</i>
<i>Over and over and over again.</i>

52:53.671 --> 52:56.840
What was Hap recording? What did it mean?

52:56.924 --> 53:00.511
He was recording the soundscapes
of our NDEs,

53:00.594 --> 53:04.223
trying to map out what it was
that people call "the other side."

53:04.890 --> 53:06.892
Yeah, I... I put that part together.

53:06.976 --> 53:08.643
Bullshit you did.

53:08.728 --> 53:11.438
Yeah, but... but why?
What was he listening for?

53:13.565 --> 53:14.566
Proof.

53:15.484 --> 53:18.445
He thought it would liberate people
to know for a fact

53:18.528 --> 53:20.280
that death is not an end.

53:20.364 --> 53:22.866
<i>We were just looking for a way out,</i>

53:22.950 --> 53:26.161
<i>and we never stopped believing</i>
<i>the experiment was our escape.</i>

53:27.454 --> 53:29.331
<i>It took years,</i>

53:29.414 --> 53:32.376
<i>but every time, Homer got a little closer.</i>

53:32.459 --> 53:35.587
<i>I told him that if he succeeded</i>
<i>and traveled conscious,</i>

53:35.671 --> 53:39.675
<i>he had to look for anything living,</i>
<i>anything moving, and swallow it whole.</i>

53:40.425 --> 53:43.220
<i>But Homer never managed</i>
<i>to escape the final gas.</i>

53:44.138 --> 53:46.473
<i>Hap always smelled his fear.</i>

53:48.017 --> 53:52.521
<i>Homer came back again and again</i>
<i>and again, remembering nothing.</i>

53:52.604 --> 53:54.106
<i>But he kept trying.</i>

53:54.982 --> 53:58.443
<i>Some days I thought</i>
<i>he was doing it just for me.</i>

53:58.527 --> 54:01.530
<i>Some days I thought</i>
<i>he was doing it to spite Hap.</i>

54:01.613 --> 54:04.700
<i>Some days I thought... it was for himself.</i>

54:05.700 --> 54:08.370
<i>Something he needed to prove, conquer.</i>

54:08.453 --> 54:12.958
<i>He was an explorer,</i>
<i>and death was his frontier.</i>

54:13.041 --> 54:17.337
<i>Whatever his reasons,</i>
<i>Homer never gave up on his mission:</i>

54:18.172 --> 54:20.048
<i>to die... awake.</i>

55:51.181 --> 55:53.809
Hey! Hey, you!
Stop right there! Stop!

55:53.892 --> 55:58.480
Hey! Come here! Stop!

56:15.122 --> 56:16.498
Hey, you!

56:31.471 --> 56:33.223
He's over here!

56:40.230 --> 56:41.690
Hey! Hey, you.

57:30.447 --> 57:32.824
When I flatlined
at the football game,

57:32.907 --> 57:34.952
when I landed on my head...

57:35.035 --> 57:38.455
I thought it was the light
at the end of a tunnel.

57:41.833 --> 57:43.335
But it's not a tunnel.

57:44.336 --> 57:45.587
It's a place.

57:46.421 --> 57:48.173
It's an actual place.

57:49.716 --> 57:51.593
Did you talk to anyone?

57:53.971 --> 57:56.223
No, I...

57:58.433 --> 58:00.060
I felt chased.

58:00.644 --> 58:03.313
But I found this, um, thing.

58:03.397 --> 58:06.525
Well, I swallowed...
I swallowed this thing.

58:06.608 --> 58:08.610
- A sea creature.
- Oh.

58:08.693 --> 58:09.903
That's good.

58:13.157 --> 58:15.367
I don't feel like I have it...

58:15.450 --> 58:16.994
or know it.

58:18.078 --> 58:19.663
However you described it.

58:22.124 --> 58:25.002
I guess I just have to go back,
keep trying.

58:26.295 --> 58:28.047
Khatun said we could do it.

58:29.506 --> 58:31.925
She said we could travel out of here.

58:34.969 --> 58:37.597
I know that seems impossible.
I mean...

58:38.973 --> 58:42.561
I know I sound like a crazy person
when I say it, I know.

58:42.644 --> 58:44.063
Eh...

58:45.314 --> 58:48.983
But I'm telling you,
when I swallowed that bird...

58:50.902 --> 58:54.739
I felt the whole thing flash through me
in an instant.

58:55.615 --> 59:00.787
Like, a way to move
through the world, through worlds.

59:00.870 --> 59:03.457
And if I don't think about it, I know it.

59:05.625 --> 59:09.546
A self, like a... a me in there
that doesn't even belong to me

59:09.629 --> 59:13.508
and it wants to come out, it wants me
to call it by name. But it's...

59:16.428 --> 59:18.138
I feel like it's waiting...

59:20.265 --> 59:21.558
for you.

59:23.727 --> 59:25.353
To hear it in you, too.

59:25.979 --> 59:27.231
I want to.

59:28.482 --> 59:30.317
You know I want to.

59:34.238 --> 59:36.365
It's a name truer than Prairie...

59:37.282 --> 59:39.159
than Nina, even.

59:41.661 --> 59:43.288
It sounds like...

59:44.206 --> 59:45.707
-Away.
-Mmm.

59:47.751 --> 59:49.544
Away...

59:49.628 --> 59:51.380
Yeah, but maybe...

59:52.339 --> 59:55.967
Oh-A. Oh... Oh way?

59:59.429 --> 1:00:02.349
I don't know, when I say it out loud,
it all falls apart.

1:00:09.231 --> 1:00:10.399
Homer?

1:00:50.730 --> 1:00:52.482
<i>OA.</i>
