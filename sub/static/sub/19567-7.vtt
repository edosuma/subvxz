WEBVTT

00:10.521 --> 00:11.943
Previously on "The Arrangement"...

00:11.965 --> 00:13.415
Wasn't sure I'd see you again.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.066
Wanna try something new?

00:15.068 --> 00:16.534
I said no!

00:16.536 --> 00:18.786
I am going to lie down on your bed

00:18.811 --> 00:21.539
and then I'm going to let
you do whatever you want.

00:21.541 --> 00:23.407
Leave Kyle. Come back
with me to New York

00:23.409 --> 00:24.868
when this is all over.

00:24.893 --> 00:26.526
We're not sleeping together.

00:26.551 --> 00:28.952
We respect each other's
artistic sensibilities.

00:28.977 --> 00:31.983
- Megan, you're under contract.
- Well, that goes for Kyle too.

00:31.985 --> 00:33.032
Lisbeth called him.

00:33.057 --> 00:34.582
I don't want anything
to get in the way of us.

00:34.607 --> 00:37.322
- Will you just trust me?
- Think I kidded myself into believing

00:37.324 --> 00:38.790
you were totally over her.

00:38.792 --> 00:40.692
There's a woman outside my influence.

00:40.694 --> 00:43.194
- I'm Detective Gaffey, LAPD.
- She has something on us.

00:43.196 --> 00:45.463
Murder/suicide at the
Institute of the Higher Mind,

00:45.465 --> 00:48.166
- ongoing investigation.
- How much do you want?

00:48.168 --> 00:50.281
- It's not money I'm after.
- She has a fantasy.

00:50.306 --> 00:52.039
I cannot do what you're asking me to do.

00:52.041 --> 00:54.108
I'm not asking. I made you,

00:54.110 --> 00:55.810
but I will end you in a heartbeat.

00:55.812 --> 00:57.445
Come in.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:21.482 --> 01:23.969
No. No!

01:25.553 --> 01:29.288
What is that thing with
the hand on his neck?

01:29.290 --> 01:31.540
Did you see that in
a movie or something?

01:32.955 --> 01:36.462
Megan, you've got to
make him believe you

01:36.464 --> 01:39.031
or nobody else will.

01:43.503 --> 01:44.970
You okay?

01:45.670 --> 01:47.457
Yeah, I'm great.

02:36.224 --> 02:38.803
So the car will pick you up
here, take you to the hangar,

02:38.828 --> 02:40.820
and they'll have you in
New York in five hours

02:40.845 --> 02:42.218
or your money back.

02:42.220 --> 02:44.302
Then we'll have a car
pick you up at the airport,

02:44.327 --> 02:46.482
- take you to Middletown...
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:46.507 --> 02:48.657
Rental car. Simple.

02:48.682 --> 02:50.982
My friends will annihilate me

02:50.984 --> 02:53.451
if I get dropped off in an Escalade.

02:53.453 --> 02:55.920
Something white and underpowered then?

02:55.922 --> 02:57.488
Preferably.

02:57.490 --> 02:58.756
Anything else?

02:58.758 --> 03:01.259
Yeah, you ever officiated a wedding?

03:01.261 --> 03:03.377
No, I'm not exactly an expert

03:03.402 --> 03:05.435
- on relationships, so...
- Right?

03:05.460 --> 03:07.494
And yet my sweet idiot of a best friend

03:07.496 --> 03:09.529
wants me to marry her off anyway.

03:09.531 --> 03:11.820
I have no idea what to say.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.633
"I ain't an expert on love

03:15.435 --> 03:16.981
"or what on God's earth

03:17.006 --> 03:18.192
"would compel two
completely different animals

03:18.217 --> 03:19.684
"like a man and woman

03:19.686 --> 03:21.819
"to devote their lives to each other,

03:21.821 --> 03:23.454
"but I know what a home is.

03:23.456 --> 03:27.777
"A home is where you eat,
sleep, raise children.

03:27.808 --> 03:30.795
"Where you feel safe enough
to think about the future.

03:31.115 --> 03:33.594
"That's what I see when
I look at these two.

03:34.184 --> 03:35.904
"I see home."

03:38.008 --> 03:39.841
Sam Elliot in "Long Desert."

03:39.843 --> 03:42.794
It's the second movie I ever did.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.492
Maybe I'll use the accent.

03:47.275 --> 03:48.828
I wish I was going with you.

03:48.853 --> 03:51.157
Timing on this Billy
Rathburn dinner really sucks.

03:51.182 --> 03:52.822
Yeah. He's a great DP.

03:52.824 --> 03:55.057
You'll be happy you
stuck around to get him.

03:55.059 --> 03:56.459
Yeah, as long as we
have the deal in place

03:56.461 --> 03:58.160
by the time he leaves
for Prague Sunday night.

03:58.162 --> 03:59.762
You will.

03:59.764 --> 04:01.430
And I'll text you when I land.

04:01.432 --> 04:02.698
Flying private,

04:02.700 --> 04:04.889
you can text me whenever you want.

04:05.396 --> 04:08.225
Oh... right.

04:11.199 --> 04:12.875
Anyways...

04:28.833 --> 04:30.433
I have to go.

04:30.652 --> 04:32.652
Slow down.

04:32.677 --> 04:34.944
You have to give it a couple of minutes.

04:36.191 --> 04:38.381
I have to go to Anaheim.

04:38.383 --> 04:40.149
Somehow convince this MacPherson woman

04:40.174 --> 04:42.495
not to sell the story
Kyle's been dying to direct

04:42.520 --> 04:43.710
to another studio.

04:43.735 --> 04:46.723
DeAnn, you're not ready. Trust me.

04:47.969 --> 04:50.403
We took you way past your comfort zone.

04:50.405 --> 04:52.939
You can't do that without
going deep inside your head

04:52.941 --> 04:54.640
and reorganizing the wiring.

04:58.613 --> 05:00.351
Ten minutes.

05:00.376 --> 05:02.628
- That'll do.
- Mm.

05:04.711 --> 05:07.012
So how long has this been your thing?

05:07.014 --> 05:08.713
I have a lot of things.

05:08.715 --> 05:11.316
I don't play the same role
with everybody I sleep with.

05:11.318 --> 05:13.101
None of us do.

05:13.126 --> 05:15.443
Do you sleep with a lot of people?

05:16.129 --> 05:17.829
Is that important?

05:17.831 --> 05:20.352
Not really. It's just...

05:20.968 --> 05:23.991
what you did with me was so specific,

05:25.237 --> 05:27.144
and you seemed to know a lot about it.

05:27.146 --> 05:29.113
I'm just wondering how you got there.

05:29.115 --> 05:31.577
And what damage I must have endured.

05:31.602 --> 05:32.745
If that's what it is.

05:32.780 --> 05:35.393
Is that what you want it to be?

05:35.683 --> 05:39.151
Me acting out, you
going along for the ride?

05:39.153 --> 05:41.255
Makes you an enabler.

05:42.985 --> 05:44.754
Annika...

05:47.923 --> 05:50.457
I get that you make your own choices.

05:50.459 --> 05:52.960
I'm just interested
in how you make them.

05:52.962 --> 05:54.428
It's probably not that different than

05:54.430 --> 05:56.664
how you and your husband
make your choices.

05:56.666 --> 05:58.583
We've chosen to agree

05:58.608 --> 06:01.065
that monogamy is unrealistic.

06:02.455 --> 06:04.615
But experimenting with sex...

06:05.739 --> 06:08.206
it's a completely different
experience when you're older.

06:08.255 --> 06:10.429
You shouldn't worry about me.

06:10.934 --> 06:12.801
I don't do anything casually,

06:12.803 --> 06:14.736
and I don't believe in settling.

06:14.738 --> 06:17.547
If I'm really interested
in something, I pursue it.

06:17.572 --> 06:19.407
Sounds so simple.

06:22.560 --> 06:24.360
And now I really do have to go.

06:25.496 --> 06:27.296
What if you don't?

06:27.298 --> 06:29.565
Well, then Kyle doesn't direct his movie

06:29.590 --> 06:31.286
and the universe explodes.

06:31.703 --> 06:33.202
Does it really explode

06:33.204 --> 06:35.783
or does it just open up?

06:47.414 --> 06:48.847
Hey.

06:48.849 --> 06:50.397
Are you aware that New York City

06:50.422 --> 06:52.432
has an up and coming theater scene?

06:52.457 --> 06:53.956
I have heard of such a thing.

06:53.958 --> 06:56.159
Well, there's some real interest

06:56.162 --> 06:58.295
in putting the play on up
here. It'd be Off-Broadway,

06:58.297 --> 07:01.031
but I've got some solid
interest from legit investors

07:01.033 --> 07:03.000
who haven't heard what
a monster I am yet.

07:03.001 --> 07:04.934
There's a meeting next week,

07:04.937 --> 07:07.086
and it'd be great if you could be here

07:07.111 --> 07:10.379
to hit them with some of that
Megan Morrison razzle-dazzle.

07:10.381 --> 07:12.381
You want me to come to New York?

07:12.383 --> 07:14.619
Yes, and don't complain

07:14.644 --> 07:16.444
because I know you can
hop on a private jet

07:16.469 --> 07:18.035
whenever you want.

07:18.251 --> 07:20.775
I'm gonna plead the fifth on that one.

07:25.625 --> 07:26.957
Are you there?

07:26.959 --> 07:28.426
I'm here.

07:28.428 --> 07:30.227
It's good to hear your real voice.

07:30.229 --> 07:33.297
I've been hearing your monologue
in my head for three weeks.

07:33.712 --> 07:36.313
Come so we can have
an actual conversation

07:36.338 --> 07:37.737
in person.

07:37.739 --> 07:40.058
With the investor, I mean.

07:43.402 --> 07:45.282
I am gonna be back east this weekend

07:45.307 --> 07:46.798
- for a wedding.
- What?

07:46.823 --> 07:48.861
But I don't know if I
can come into the city.

07:48.862 --> 07:50.477
Shut up! Of course you can.

07:50.502 --> 07:53.635
Megan, it's meant to be. I
can't do this without you.

08:17.968 --> 08:19.301
Get out of the way.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.027
Avoiding me is not gonna help you, Kyle.

08:22.029 --> 08:24.652
We have to fix this together.

08:25.211 --> 08:28.023
With bullshit
conversations and apologies,

08:28.048 --> 08:31.038
and you trying to convince me
that everything you did was okay?

08:31.040 --> 08:34.006
I'm not here to tell you it was okay.

08:34.009 --> 08:36.210
It was not okay, it was horrible.

08:36.212 --> 08:37.578
And I hate that I had to do it,

08:37.580 --> 08:39.145
and I understand that you're angry,

08:39.148 --> 08:42.200
but I'm asking you to
do what I'm trying to do,

08:42.225 --> 08:44.470
which is look at the bigger picture.

08:46.698 --> 08:48.663
You can do this.

08:48.665 --> 08:50.400
You've done the work, Kyle.

08:51.034 --> 08:53.058
Locate your better self.

08:55.438 --> 08:58.532
How hard did you fight for me?

08:59.042 --> 09:01.704
How hard did you try to make
a different deal with her?

09:02.446 --> 09:05.114
Gaffey said you jumped at the chance

09:05.116 --> 09:06.803
to pimp me out.

09:07.009 --> 09:08.279
Why?

09:09.342 --> 09:12.096
So you could remind me who's boss?

09:12.278 --> 09:15.942
Kyle, think about what you're doing.

09:16.416 --> 09:18.318
This violence,

09:18.794 --> 09:20.592
it's a regression.

09:20.617 --> 09:21.958
Maybe.

09:21.983 --> 09:25.058
But at least now I see you.

09:25.629 --> 09:27.355
You're a fraud.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.325
Don't come near me again.

09:55.816 --> 09:57.062
Thanks.

10:04.425 --> 10:06.391
Hey, what's going on?

10:06.416 --> 10:08.183
Hey, I, uh...

10:08.518 --> 10:10.896
I know it's last minute, but...

10:10.898 --> 10:12.947
can I go to the wedding with you?

10:14.280 --> 10:16.814
I mean, sure. Yeah, of course,

10:16.816 --> 10:19.152
but is everything okay?

10:19.619 --> 10:21.330
Everything's fine.

10:22.588 --> 10:25.279
What about your meeting with Rathburn?

10:26.187 --> 10:28.354
I don't have it in
me to romance the guy.

10:28.356 --> 10:31.157
If he wants to do my
film, he'll do my film.

10:31.606 --> 10:33.926
Kyle, last time you blew town on a whim,

10:33.928 --> 10:36.062
it was about the photos.

10:36.392 --> 10:38.592
Is there something you're
trying to get away from?

10:38.594 --> 10:40.098
No.

10:40.221 --> 10:42.962
You're just the only person
I want to be with right now.

10:44.466 --> 10:45.832
Okay.

11:09.464 --> 11:11.987
- Sorry, bad time?
- What is it?

11:12.012 --> 11:13.979
The mayor's chief of staff
will be here in 15 minutes

11:14.005 --> 11:16.572
and you said you wanted to drop
in on the facilitator training.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.381
Huh.

11:42.406 --> 11:43.868
You okay?

11:43.870 --> 11:46.871
Just realized the last time I was here.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.538
Day of my mother's funeral.

11:51.692 --> 11:53.366
You need a minute?

11:53.391 --> 11:54.908
Megan!

11:54.933 --> 11:56.423
Too late.

11:58.155 --> 12:00.389
Holy shit.

12:00.391 --> 12:02.224
You're getting married!

12:02.226 --> 12:03.525
I love you, I love you, I love you.

12:03.527 --> 12:04.760
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, I love you.

12:06.167 --> 12:08.400
And you are better looking in person,

12:08.402 --> 12:10.169
which doesn't seem like
it should be possible.

12:10.170 --> 12:12.537
- This is ridiculous.
- Kyle, this is Tessa,

12:12.539 --> 12:14.611
- and she has no filter.
- It's great to meet you.

12:14.636 --> 12:16.035
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

12:16.037 --> 12:18.638
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God, look who's here.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.273
Mom, put the phone away.

12:20.275 --> 12:21.808
- That's so embarrassing.
- Oh, honey.

12:21.810 --> 12:23.410
it's Kyle West, sweetie.

12:23.435 --> 12:25.168
I mean, he's used to cameras.

12:25.193 --> 12:27.113
You don't mind, it's
just for my Facebook page.

12:27.138 --> 12:29.374
Oh, hey, everybody.

12:29.724 --> 12:31.488
How's my daughter out of the bullpen?

12:31.513 --> 12:33.012
Hey, I'm great.

12:33.037 --> 12:34.178
- Oh, geez.
- Oh.

12:34.203 --> 12:35.936
- This is Kyle.
- Hey.

12:35.961 --> 12:37.320
Ollie Flanagan.

12:37.345 --> 12:39.202
They got miter saws in Hollywood?

12:39.246 --> 12:42.078
Good. 'Cause you're gonna help
me build a gazebo. Let's go.

12:42.103 --> 12:43.857
I love gazebos.

12:44.279 --> 12:45.504
Where's Bryan?

12:45.506 --> 12:47.673
Oh, he's off with some of the boys.

12:47.675 --> 12:49.553
I hate him so much right now. I
can't believe I'm marrying him.

12:49.578 --> 12:50.907
Oh, stop, you love him.

12:50.932 --> 12:53.279
I know. He's great.

12:54.382 --> 12:56.415
- Hmm.
- You...

12:56.417 --> 13:00.152
are somehow worried about
your perfect new life.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.974
You are pregnant,

13:02.999 --> 13:04.623
and you haven't told anyone.

13:04.625 --> 13:06.160
Oh, my God, you're a witch.

13:06.185 --> 13:07.351
I am a witch,

13:07.353 --> 13:09.541
- and your boobs.
- I know.

13:09.566 --> 13:11.633
- Bryan is beside himself.
- Mm, I'm sure.

13:11.635 --> 13:13.324
Let's go.

13:26.007 --> 13:27.029
Done.

13:29.296 --> 13:30.811
You are a good sport,

13:30.836 --> 13:32.386
and you lose a bet.

13:33.486 --> 13:35.533
I figured you would have
hit your finger at least once

13:35.558 --> 13:37.110
or busted a nail or something.

13:37.112 --> 13:38.310
You wanna see me embarrass myself,

13:38.335 --> 13:39.846
put me in front of a Ram's game.

13:39.848 --> 13:41.148
I will yell my head off.

13:41.150 --> 13:42.649
You wouldn't have to do any yelling.

13:42.651 --> 13:44.451
Liking the Rams would
be embarrassing enough.

13:44.453 --> 13:45.767
Giants country.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.687
- Mm.
- Ah, excuse me.

13:47.689 --> 13:50.457
- My agent's calling.
- "My agent."

13:50.459 --> 13:52.592
Look who's gone all Hollywood on us now.

13:53.704 --> 13:54.932
She's worse than you are.

13:54.957 --> 13:56.080
Way worse.

13:58.361 --> 14:00.194
You guys got a great place.

14:00.196 --> 14:03.085
I can see why Megan
spent so much time here.

14:04.109 --> 14:07.010
So, in general,

14:07.035 --> 14:08.908
she's as happy as she looks?

14:08.933 --> 14:10.568
I think so.

14:11.179 --> 14:13.580
Good. Keep it going.

14:13.582 --> 14:16.049
You don't want me to
have to get on a plane.

14:20.383 --> 14:21.983
Oh.

14:22.009 --> 14:24.546
"Please, Billy. Please
don't send me away.

14:24.578 --> 14:26.511
"I was made for you.
Can't you see that?"

14:26.513 --> 14:27.946
"I can't.

14:27.948 --> 14:30.360
"I can't take everything
you gave me and...

14:30.385 --> 14:32.083
"Share it with someone else.

14:32.108 --> 14:35.323
"It's yours. It can only be yours."

14:36.583 --> 14:38.483
It's that movie.

14:38.485 --> 14:39.719
What movie?

14:39.744 --> 14:41.386
"The Opposite of Jessica."

14:41.388 --> 14:43.454
- What? Who?
- Charlotte Banks?

14:43.456 --> 14:46.351
Oh, we probably watched
that movie 100 times,

14:46.376 --> 14:48.977
and now I'm gonna be
reading with her on Monday.

14:50.072 --> 14:51.913
Yeah, she's doing this
limited series for Hulu

14:51.915 --> 14:53.781
and they had to fire
one of the actresses,

14:53.783 --> 14:56.017
and her producing
partner saw me in the play

14:56.019 --> 14:58.686
- and called Leslie.
- Megan, that's amazing.

14:58.688 --> 15:00.555
Oh, my God, I get to
meet Charlotte Banks.

15:00.557 --> 15:02.023
Fantastic!

15:02.025 --> 15:03.658
I know.

15:05.812 --> 15:07.411
Oh, boy.

15:07.413 --> 15:09.313
I forgot how small this place is.

15:09.338 --> 15:11.482
Your closet's literally
bigger than this room.

15:13.009 --> 15:14.642
That's fine.

15:14.644 --> 15:16.591
Kinda nice for the weekend.

15:19.923 --> 15:22.324
Oh, my God, look at you.

15:22.326 --> 15:23.858
Oh, let me guess:

15:23.860 --> 15:25.927
braces, ombré hair, and a choker?

15:25.929 --> 15:27.459
Yep.

15:28.031 --> 15:30.231
God, you're in so many of these.

15:31.435 --> 15:33.835
Kind of a second family for you, huh?

15:33.837 --> 15:35.571
Yeah, kind of.

15:37.625 --> 15:39.392
Who are all these people?

15:39.394 --> 15:41.053
Um...

15:41.863 --> 15:44.497
it's, like, high school friends mostly.

15:44.781 --> 15:46.481
You'll probably meet them all tomorrow.

15:47.951 --> 15:49.550
Okay.

16:08.469 --> 16:10.269
- Hey...
- Hey.

16:10.294 --> 16:13.462
- Where are you?
- I'm here.

16:13.465 --> 16:15.219
I'm right here.

16:15.966 --> 16:17.338
Okay.

16:18.402 --> 16:21.519
I just wanna look over
my speech for tomorrow.

16:24.631 --> 16:26.064
Sure.

16:33.789 --> 16:36.056
So, what're you gonna say tomorrow?

16:36.058 --> 16:37.557
I don't know.

16:37.559 --> 16:39.693
I think I'm just gonna
get really, really drunk

16:39.695 --> 16:41.261
and basically just wing it. Yeah.

16:41.263 --> 16:43.897
Mm, just whatever comes to mind.

16:43.899 --> 16:46.315
"We are gathered here today for...

16:46.340 --> 16:48.573
"Holy shit. Look how fat Bryan got."

16:48.598 --> 16:49.608
Bryan? Really?

16:49.633 --> 16:52.533
Mm, yeah. Sympathy weight.

16:52.535 --> 16:55.169
He's just getting a
head start. It's sweet.

16:55.171 --> 16:56.337
Aww.

16:56.339 --> 16:57.905
He's excited about the baby?

16:57.907 --> 16:59.107
Yeah, totally.

16:59.109 --> 17:01.378
I mean, we both are.

17:03.369 --> 17:05.723
I don't know what
happened. I feel like...

17:06.069 --> 17:08.903
all of a sudden the next
five years of my life

17:08.928 --> 17:11.422
are planned out for me.

17:12.083 --> 17:14.829
Sometimes it completely freaks me out.

17:15.300 --> 17:18.297
So how serious is it
between you and Kyle?

17:19.058 --> 17:20.458
It's serious. Mm-hmm.

17:20.483 --> 17:22.449
Yeah, like talking
about the future serious?

17:22.473 --> 17:24.107
Um, sure.

17:24.108 --> 17:25.811
We've... we've talked about it.

17:25.837 --> 17:27.002
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

17:27.005 --> 17:29.205
And does he want to get married or...?

17:29.207 --> 17:31.073
I mean,

17:31.358 --> 17:33.325
it's not like I have it
in writing or anything,

17:33.350 --> 17:35.951
but, yeah, you know.

17:36.482 --> 17:38.585
Why aren't you more excited?

17:39.022 --> 17:41.456
I don't know. I am.

17:41.458 --> 17:43.091
- Oh, I can tell.
- I am.

17:43.093 --> 17:45.584
- You're excited.
- I love Kyle.

17:45.609 --> 17:47.269
I do. It's...

17:47.902 --> 17:49.502
we've always had this thing.

17:49.527 --> 17:53.496
This unspoken deep connection

17:53.498 --> 17:55.229
from the moment we met.

17:55.254 --> 17:57.455
Like, even when things have been weird,

17:57.457 --> 17:59.957
it's pretty much always been there.

18:00.314 --> 18:02.674
But you're worried it's not gonna last.

18:04.489 --> 18:06.853
I don't know. Everything's
just moving really fast,

18:06.878 --> 18:09.667
and it's... it's great, but...

18:10.601 --> 18:14.470
sometimes I have this feeling
like so much could go wrong.

18:14.751 --> 18:17.846
I mean, we're just
figuring each other out.

18:18.288 --> 18:20.855
I still don't understand
why Bryan likes Nickelback.

18:20.857 --> 18:22.190
See, man?

18:22.192 --> 18:24.777
Relationships are hard.

18:29.199 --> 18:30.465
You know there's a picture of Rebecca

18:30.467 --> 18:32.314
on the wall in that room?

18:33.253 --> 18:34.485
Oh, shit.

18:34.510 --> 18:35.843
She's coming to the wedding tomorrow.

18:35.845 --> 18:37.211
- I forgot to tell you.
- Wait. She's coming to the wedding?

18:37.213 --> 18:38.637
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, her mom and my mom

18:38.662 --> 18:40.836
have been, like besties
for the past year or so

18:40.861 --> 18:42.049
because of, like, spin class

18:42.051 --> 18:44.852
or something and so now
Rebecca's on the wall

18:44.854 --> 18:48.055
and she's at the wedding
and I am really sorry.

18:48.057 --> 18:51.065
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I mean...

18:51.719 --> 18:53.481
- I just didn't...
- It's not like she's with,

18:53.506 --> 18:55.829
you know, Evan anymore. It's...

18:56.813 --> 18:58.520
It's no worries.

18:58.545 --> 18:59.914
Okay.

18:59.916 --> 19:01.593
I love you.

19:02.932 --> 19:04.565
And I'm suddenly exhausted.

19:04.567 --> 19:05.866
You're getting married tomorrow.

19:05.869 --> 19:08.570
Oh, Jesus Christ.

19:08.572 --> 19:09.871
No worries.

19:09.873 --> 19:12.399
It's a California term I learned.

19:12.424 --> 19:14.233
- I'm gonna go to bed.
- Mm-kay.

19:14.258 --> 19:16.649
- Good night.
- Love you too.

20:54.306 --> 20:55.672
Jesus.

20:55.675 --> 20:58.342
Your god complex
should treat you better.

20:58.344 --> 21:00.811
Well, for once, I agree with you.

21:00.813 --> 21:03.080
When's the last time you saw the sun?

21:03.082 --> 21:05.015
I'm creating the sun, Terence.

21:05.017 --> 21:07.051
Ah. Of course you are.

21:07.053 --> 21:09.053
See my god complex never lets me down

21:09.055 --> 21:11.152
'cause it's based in science.

21:12.091 --> 21:14.625
Give me a few minutes.
We'll get you set up.

21:31.239 --> 21:32.806
I think if you take your seat,

21:32.808 --> 21:35.008
we might be able to
get this thing started.

21:35.010 --> 21:36.517
Got you.

21:37.279 --> 21:39.059
Break a leg, sweetie.

21:39.381 --> 21:41.214
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

21:41.720 --> 21:43.386
You okay?

21:43.388 --> 21:46.742
Yeah, I just didn't sleep
very well last night.

21:47.092 --> 21:50.226
Hey, you are gonna do great.

21:50.228 --> 21:52.162
- Okay.
- All right.

22:13.984 --> 22:15.978
Everyone, please be seated.

22:19.711 --> 22:22.278
I'm so honored to be
here with you all today

22:22.303 --> 22:26.132
and I am truly humbled
that Tessa and Bryan

22:26.157 --> 22:27.807
asked me to help them take the next step

22:27.809 --> 22:29.878
in their life together.

22:30.545 --> 22:32.845
I'm 100% going to cry during this.

22:32.847 --> 22:35.648
Just so you know. So buckle up.

22:49.777 --> 22:51.211
Whew.

22:51.804 --> 22:54.971
A wedding is more than a
ceremony between two people.

22:54.973 --> 22:56.606
It's between all of us.

22:56.608 --> 22:58.375
We all have a responsibility

22:58.377 --> 23:01.029
to foster and support the love

23:01.054 --> 23:03.855
between Tessa and Bryan.

23:11.858 --> 23:13.758
It's a dissociative enactogen.

23:13.760 --> 23:16.127
Synthetic psilocybin, essentially.

23:16.129 --> 23:18.989
Shrooms. With no side effects.

23:20.799 --> 23:22.900
Always good talking to you, Isaac.

24:23.991 --> 24:25.713
What the hell is this?

24:26.039 --> 24:28.376
Hey, this is your subconscious.

24:28.401 --> 24:30.194
You tell me what it is.

24:32.339 --> 24:35.907
It's a metaphor, but
it's not very imaginative.

24:35.909 --> 24:37.622
Classic story though.

24:37.647 --> 24:39.814
The shepherd has lost his flock.

24:39.816 --> 24:42.222
How is he going to get them back?

24:42.718 --> 24:44.248
I don't know.

24:44.587 --> 24:46.082
I don't care.

24:46.913 --> 24:48.846
This is not where I wanna be.

24:48.848 --> 24:50.305
I know.

24:51.512 --> 24:52.972
Through there.

24:53.915 --> 24:55.548
That's where you wanna be.

25:24.720 --> 25:26.268
Terry?

25:26.532 --> 25:27.747
Is that you?

25:29.458 --> 25:31.391
Jesus Christ.

25:31.393 --> 25:32.780
Where have you been?

25:33.295 --> 25:34.711
I missed you.

25:38.654 --> 25:40.587
I want you.

25:52.308 --> 25:54.375
Congratulations, big man.

25:54.376 --> 25:55.789
Thanks.

25:56.511 --> 25:59.579
I give 'em a year. Maybe two.

25:59.843 --> 26:02.777
Then they'll both realize
Tessa's way too good for him.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.982
You're a good man, Ollie.

26:06.072 --> 26:07.959
Don't make me cry.

26:14.416 --> 26:17.017
Tell me again what you're
wearing to this thing.

26:17.042 --> 26:19.920
Black? I love when you go dark.

26:22.089 --> 26:24.073
What am I doing in Kyle's house?

26:24.098 --> 26:25.698
What?

26:25.826 --> 26:28.393
Sweetie, who's Kyle?

26:31.265 --> 26:33.298
I'm wearing the silver Versace.

26:33.300 --> 26:36.053
I don't give a shit what Esme says.

26:37.160 --> 26:39.861
I'm supposed to be figuring
out where I went wrong.

26:39.886 --> 26:41.118
Where's the dialectic?

26:41.120 --> 26:43.632
Terry? Terry.

26:44.424 --> 26:46.579
This is a very bad trip.

26:47.393 --> 26:49.193
Look deeper.

26:56.002 --> 26:58.310
This is what you've always wanted.

27:15.231 --> 27:17.302
I'll have a white wine, please.

27:18.738 --> 27:20.497
Megan.

27:20.889 --> 27:23.754
Hey. Rebecca, how are you?

27:23.779 --> 27:25.295
Good.

27:25.915 --> 27:28.517
I can't believe how long it's been.

27:28.887 --> 27:31.452
I teach social studies at MHS now.

27:31.454 --> 27:33.193
10th graders. Oh, my God.

27:33.218 --> 27:36.153
Oh, my God, yeah,
that's... that's great.

27:36.459 --> 27:38.928
And you're obviously doing amazing.

27:38.953 --> 27:41.662
- Oh.
- It's crazy, right?

27:41.664 --> 27:44.838
- We're all grown up.
- That is crazy.

27:46.702 --> 27:47.868
It's just sad.

27:47.870 --> 27:50.335
Evan could be here with us. You know?

27:50.959 --> 27:53.147
He'd be really proud of you.

27:54.581 --> 27:56.049
Excuse me.

28:08.095 --> 28:09.421
Hey.

28:09.896 --> 28:11.294
Hi.

28:12.099 --> 28:14.219
You gotta tell me what's going on.

28:14.244 --> 28:16.410
You've been acting like this all day.

28:17.080 --> 28:19.884
It's just being back. It's a lot.

28:21.142 --> 28:23.109
Is it okay if we don't talk about it?

28:23.111 --> 28:25.611
- Just dance with me.

- Megan...
- I don't wanna talk about it.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.034
You just looked at me like
I was some kind of monster.

29:15.059 --> 29:18.069
- It's not about you, Kyle.
- Who's it about then?

29:18.071 --> 29:19.371
Tell me what the hell is going on.

29:19.373 --> 29:21.610
I don't wanna talk about it!

29:24.933 --> 29:27.562
I'm pretty sure you wouldn't
let me get away with that.

29:29.405 --> 29:32.039
Yeah, well, I guess life
isn't fair sometimes.

29:34.045 --> 29:36.154
Okay.

29:41.434 --> 29:44.001
It's about my stepbrother.

29:48.886 --> 29:50.548
He, uh...

29:53.851 --> 29:56.654
he used to come in my bedroom at night.

30:00.624 --> 30:02.758
Do you understand?

30:06.993 --> 30:10.066
He told me not to lock
the door and I didn't.

30:12.410 --> 30:14.156
When was this?

30:17.717 --> 30:19.735
When I was 11.

30:24.678 --> 30:27.265
And when I was 14...

30:30.084 --> 30:32.936
He got a girlfriend, and...

30:33.841 --> 30:37.242
all I could think was that I
must have done something wrong

30:37.244 --> 30:39.384
to make him leave me.

30:41.215 --> 30:43.788
And she's here.

30:43.951 --> 30:47.319
The girlfriend, uh, Rebecca,

30:47.321 --> 30:49.655
and she has no idea.

30:51.089 --> 30:53.089
Seeing her brought it all back.

30:58.379 --> 31:00.231
Where's he?

31:01.314 --> 31:03.125
He died. He, um...

31:03.150 --> 31:05.615
he fell in with the wrong people, and...

31:07.054 --> 31:10.041
I just can't seem to get rid of him.

31:13.109 --> 31:14.575
- Megan, listen to me.
- Please don't.

31:14.577 --> 31:16.069
- Megan, listen.
- And please don't tell me

31:16.094 --> 31:17.555
that I have nothing to be ashamed of

31:17.580 --> 31:19.429
because you don't know.

31:24.292 --> 31:26.325
You two, come on.

31:26.350 --> 31:28.551
Tessa and Bryan are about to leave.

31:28.553 --> 31:29.985
Come on.

32:45.305 --> 32:48.259
What? What are you talking about?

32:49.141 --> 32:50.974
Nothing.

32:50.976 --> 32:52.423
Oh, I get it.

32:52.495 --> 32:54.528
I'm torturing myself.

32:54.880 --> 32:56.574
That's what this is.

32:57.612 --> 32:59.254
I'm an actor again.

32:59.547 --> 33:01.681
The last time I felt like a fraud.

33:01.683 --> 33:03.077
Terry...

33:03.102 --> 33:07.024
you are the biggest
movie star in the world.

33:07.575 --> 33:10.309
Now we're gonna go to your premiere...

33:10.311 --> 33:13.721
and you are going to
knock their socks off.

33:13.746 --> 33:15.313
Stop!

33:15.550 --> 33:17.850
I want this to stop.

33:20.288 --> 33:22.655
For some people, playing make-believe

33:22.657 --> 33:25.173
is the most real thing you could do.

33:25.660 --> 33:27.560
But that's not acting.

33:27.969 --> 33:30.358
You gonna tell me what acting is now?

33:30.905 --> 33:32.972
Acting is accessing real feelings

33:32.974 --> 33:35.984
and bringing them to
life through the text.

33:36.707 --> 33:39.671
You gotta have feelings
to access 'em, buddy.

33:39.696 --> 33:41.568
I have feelings.

33:41.854 --> 33:43.911
Just not the right ones.

33:44.324 --> 33:47.692
Sophie Marchuk died and
I felt inconvenienced.

33:47.694 --> 33:48.972
I know.

33:49.562 --> 33:51.929
Connor blew his brains
out in front of me

33:51.931 --> 33:53.164
and I felt relief.

33:55.201 --> 33:56.712
And you're right.

33:57.312 --> 33:58.912
I didn't fight for you.

33:58.937 --> 34:02.806
Gaffey made her pitch, and I said yes.

34:03.308 --> 34:05.538
I just wanted it to be done with.

34:06.968 --> 34:08.551
I've built my life
around helping people,

34:08.576 --> 34:10.703
and I don't care about anybody.

34:10.705 --> 34:13.272
We all have a monster inside.

34:13.274 --> 34:14.474
Right-size it

34:14.498 --> 34:16.308
and get present with your narrative.

34:16.333 --> 34:18.366
Oh, you're mocking me now?

34:18.389 --> 34:20.456
Your words, man.

34:20.458 --> 34:22.859
You created all this.

34:22.860 --> 34:24.388
Including me.

34:24.996 --> 34:26.407
Exactly.

34:27.417 --> 34:29.025
It's all on me.

34:29.050 --> 34:30.819
All of it.

34:30.875 --> 34:32.980
And nobody will tell me how to fix it.

34:35.068 --> 34:36.634
Tell me how to fix it.

34:38.172 --> 34:39.875
I need help.

34:41.045 --> 34:42.466
Help me!

34:55.152 --> 34:57.448
You're holding on too tight.

35:01.191 --> 35:02.991
Car's here, babe.

35:29.134 --> 35:32.542
Not exactly the way we
thought the weekend would go.

35:34.718 --> 35:36.318
You're telling me.

35:36.320 --> 35:39.559
I basically built a
gazebo with my bare hands.

35:43.386 --> 35:45.703
That's not all you did.

35:52.433 --> 35:55.736
You let me be exactly
the way I needed to be.

35:56.370 --> 35:58.406
You let me freak out...

35:58.456 --> 36:01.059
and be angry and...

36:01.942 --> 36:04.343
that made me feel... I don't know.

36:04.754 --> 36:06.145
Safe.

36:07.998 --> 36:09.363
Exactly.

36:11.302 --> 36:13.026
You're always safe with me.

36:28.959 --> 36:30.212
Let's send an apology

36:30.237 --> 36:32.026
and a bottle of Glenfiddich over to Ken,

36:32.028 --> 36:34.329
and get lunch back on the
books as soon as possible.

36:34.331 --> 36:36.130
Did you still wanna speak
to the coordinators tonight?

36:36.132 --> 36:38.700
No, and tell Claire I'm gonna
run her workshop tomorrow.

36:38.702 --> 36:39.998
The whole thing?

36:40.023 --> 36:42.215
Yeah. Time to get back to basics.

36:42.706 --> 36:44.567
Welcome back.

36:45.482 --> 36:47.021
You seem rejuvenated.

36:47.023 --> 36:48.850
Did your little trip treat you well?

36:48.875 --> 36:52.054
- It did.
- Good.

36:52.515 --> 36:55.580
We need to discuss
Kyle's directing plans.

36:55.582 --> 36:58.417
I've been doing a lot of soul searching

36:58.495 --> 37:00.228
and I really feel that

37:00.253 --> 37:02.982
we need to rethink our approach on this.

37:04.247 --> 37:06.447
Actually, I'm gonna
leave that up to you.

37:06.850 --> 37:08.349
You are?

37:08.351 --> 37:10.018
Well, you're the producer.

37:10.020 --> 37:11.319
Do what feels right.

37:11.511 --> 37:13.606
Unless you need help figuring it out.

37:25.463 --> 37:28.264
We all have different
reasons for being here.

37:28.574 --> 37:30.423
We want change in our lives...

37:30.448 --> 37:33.309
or are looking for creative inspiration.

37:34.159 --> 37:35.925
Maybe we're just here
to please our girlfriend

37:35.927 --> 37:37.440
who's making us do this.

37:38.829 --> 37:40.858
It doesn't really matter.

37:40.860 --> 37:43.048
It doesn't matter why you're here.

37:43.296 --> 37:44.913
You're here.

37:46.268 --> 37:48.958
And the one thing that
we all have in common,

37:49.327 --> 37:51.764
the one thing that makes us the same,

37:52.130 --> 37:53.863
is that we're all drawn to IHM

37:53.865 --> 37:56.822
because we want to move forward.

37:57.479 --> 37:58.879
Right? We want to move forward.

37:58.881 --> 38:01.982
Out of what feels stagnant and stale

38:01.983 --> 38:04.760
into something that's actually alive.

38:06.062 --> 38:08.046
That's why we're here.

38:10.167 --> 38:12.567
Now, usually, at this point,
we'd go around the circle

38:12.569 --> 38:14.805
and share our stories...

38:16.482 --> 38:17.848
but I'm gonna switch it up today,

38:17.850 --> 38:19.228
if you don't mind.

38:22.156 --> 38:23.625
Sam...

38:24.258 --> 38:25.872
why are you here?

38:28.883 --> 38:30.516
I shouldn't be here.

38:30.541 --> 38:32.074
I'm sorry. A little louder, please.

38:32.099 --> 38:34.066
I shouldn't be here.

38:34.068 --> 38:36.268
You mean here at IHM or...

38:36.270 --> 38:38.347
I shouldn't be anywhere.

38:40.774 --> 38:43.441
You wanna die? Is that it?

38:47.442 --> 38:48.736
Why?

38:49.444 --> 38:51.257
Why do you wanna die?

38:59.425 --> 39:02.488
Sam, I promise you,
whatever your story is,

39:02.862 --> 39:04.928
it does more damage buried inside you

39:04.930 --> 39:06.934
than if you share it with us.

39:13.826 --> 39:17.080
Three years ago, this week...

39:17.666 --> 39:20.939
my father killed my family.

39:23.772 --> 39:26.772
Came back from work, he shot my mother,

39:27.642 --> 39:29.081
my sister...

39:30.639 --> 39:32.653
and then he shot himself.

39:35.453 --> 39:38.288
The only reason he didn't
kill me is that I...

39:38.290 --> 39:41.579
I went to a friend's
house that day to get high.

39:47.327 --> 39:49.494
Best decision you ever made.

39:52.266 --> 39:55.267
I've done nothing with my life.

39:56.778 --> 39:58.587
I've done nothing...

39:58.962 --> 40:00.809
to justify it.

40:05.304 --> 40:08.026
And do you think about killing yourself?

40:08.507 --> 40:10.354
All the time.

40:11.802 --> 40:13.953
Then why don't you just do it?

40:14.649 --> 40:16.602
Because I'm scared.

40:16.879 --> 40:18.528
No, you're not scared, Sam.

40:18.530 --> 40:21.358
You don't do it because
deep down inside...

40:21.767 --> 40:24.734
you know there's something
worth sticking around for.

40:26.271 --> 40:28.826
Because if you really wanted to die...

40:29.441 --> 40:31.541
you would have done it three years ago.

40:31.995 --> 40:33.904
So let me ask you again.

40:35.351 --> 40:37.279
Why did you come here?

40:40.623 --> 40:42.790
Because I want things to change.

40:42.792 --> 40:44.280
Yes.

40:44.560 --> 40:47.124
That's right, Sam. Change.

40:48.170 --> 40:49.706
Change.

40:53.243 --> 40:54.943
The universe decided to spare you

40:54.945 --> 40:57.045
and you have no idea why.

40:57.047 --> 40:59.447
That's what you can't deal with.

40:59.449 --> 41:01.234
And let me tell you something:

41:01.259 --> 41:03.551
I have no idea why either.

41:03.886 --> 41:05.382
No clue.

41:06.525 --> 41:08.741
But I can promise you this:

41:09.236 --> 41:11.307
over the next three days,

41:11.332 --> 41:13.492
we're gonna figure it out.

41:14.507 --> 41:16.407
Do you trust me?

41:21.619 --> 41:23.616
Can you say that out loud?
'Cause that's a pretty big thing

41:23.641 --> 41:25.949
to say to someone if you really mean it.

41:28.226 --> 41:29.915
I trust you.

41:33.547 --> 41:35.036
Stand up.

41:38.737 --> 41:41.489
Sam is the reason you
all came here this week.

41:42.607 --> 41:44.641
He's your change.

41:44.643 --> 41:46.821
He's your inspiration.

41:49.156 --> 41:51.451
And now you're his new family.

42:13.837 --> 42:15.237
You order the Thai food

42:15.239 --> 42:17.639
and I'll find some really bad TV for us.

42:17.664 --> 42:19.529
Done and done.

42:20.267 --> 42:22.067
- Oh, my God.
- What the...

42:37.968 --> 42:39.600
_

42:42.839 --> 42:44.138
Stuff's thrown around everywhere,

42:44.140 --> 42:45.467
but everything seems to be here.

42:45.492 --> 42:47.475
I don't know what the
hell they'd be looking for.

42:47.477 --> 42:49.075
Maybe nothing.

42:49.100 --> 42:50.622
How is this possible?

42:50.647 --> 42:52.422
You have a security system.

42:54.241 --> 42:56.117
It was on. I made sure of it.

42:56.119 --> 42:58.586
I'm gonna need the names of
everybody else who has access.

42:58.588 --> 43:00.104
Getting those for you now.

43:00.129 --> 43:01.662
Your systems also out of date.

43:01.664 --> 43:02.730
Someone who knows what they're doing

43:02.732 --> 43:04.241
could easily bypass that.

43:04.266 --> 43:06.633
Maybe they're looking to make a point.

43:07.002 --> 43:09.135
The point being what?

43:09.160 --> 43:11.780
That they can come
in any time they want.
