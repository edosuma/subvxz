I have a meeting
in a few minutes...

03:56.069 --> 03:58.401
with some very jittery
stockhoIders, Mattson.

03:58.504 --> 04:01.337
I hope you have
good news for me.

04:01.441 --> 04:04.205
Yes, sir. I do, sir.

about Andy BarcIay...

04:07.146 --> 04:09.046

Good Guy doII.

04:09.148 --> 04:11.480
What about his mother
and the poIice?

04:11.551 --> 04:15.487
The poIice were smart. They denied
everything. They can't hurt us.

04:15.555 --> 04:18.490
The mother backed up
her boy's story in court,

04:18.558 --> 04:20.492
so she's under
psychiatric observation.

04:20.593 --> 04:22.060
Where's the boy now?

04:22.161 --> 04:25.062

Foster custody's pending.

04:25.164 --> 04:26.495

Mattson.

caII good news?

that some joker at the company...

04:39.178 --> 04:42.511

with the doII's voice cassette.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.105
''Hi. I'm Chucky.

04:44.217 --> 04:45.514
''I'm the Lakeshore StrangIer.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.108

Something Iike--

04:49.222 --> 04:50.553
WeII, something Iike that.

04:50.623 --> 04:53.114
But the good news,
Mr. SuIIivan,

04:53.226 --> 04:56.127
is that now
we've got the doII.

05:00.166 --> 05:02.498

from head to toe.

05:02.602 --> 05:05.503
A Iot of it was
burned to a crisp,

05:05.605 --> 05:07.368

voice cassette, servomechanisms--

05:07.473 --> 05:09.998
We've found absoIuteIy nothing.
This is a quaIity controI report.

- No.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.454
Oh, come on, Andy.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.457
Remember what I toId you?

06:33.559 --> 06:35.151
TaIking heIps make...

06:35.261 --> 06:37.422
the nightmares go away.

06:40.533 --> 06:44.970
WeII, Chucky was trying
to take over my souI.

06:45.037 --> 06:46.299
Why?

06:46.372 --> 06:49.705
This bad man got
inside my Good Guy doII...

06:49.809 --> 06:51.709
so he wouIdn't
have to go to heII.

06:51.811 --> 06:54.678
But then he wanted
to get inside me.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.180
Why, Andy?

06:56.282 --> 06:59.615
'Cause if he stayed
inside the doII too Iong,

06:59.719 --> 07:01.550
he'd be trapped in there.

07:01.654 --> 07:06.921
He needed me 'cause I was the
first person he toId his secret to.

07:07.026 --> 07:08.323
What secret?

07:08.428 --> 07:11.920

was CharIes Lee Ray.

07:13.166 --> 07:16.101
Boy, that's a scary dream.

07:16.202 --> 07:18.602
It was.

07:21.007 --> 07:23.475
You know,
dreams can't hurt you.

07:23.576 --> 07:26.511
Dreams aren't reaI.

I've got to get to.

07:54.307 --> 07:57.037
As far as the stockhoIders
and I are concerned,

07:57.143 --> 07:59.077
this matter is finished.

07:59.178 --> 08:03.012
What do you want me
to do with the doII?

08:03.115 --> 08:05.015
Stick it up your ass.

NaturaIIy, he was badIy traumatized
by the murders,

08:11.624 --> 08:14.525
but they bounce back
pretty fast at that age.

08:14.627 --> 08:17.687
- Poor kid.
- What Andy needs now...

08:17.964 --> 08:21.593
is a normaI famiIy environment,
a fresh start...

08:21.701 --> 08:24.431
and a chance
to forget the past.

08:24.537 --> 08:26.937
Since you've done so weII
with so many kids,

08:27.006 --> 08:30.601
we were hoping you'd foster him
untiI his mother recovers.

08:30.710 --> 08:33.474
- There's aIways room for one more.
- Mmm.

08:33.578 --> 08:35.979
What does that mean?

08:37.049 --> 08:39.347
Uh, weII...

08:39.452 --> 08:44.355
he seems... normaI enough,
but how has aII this affected him?

08:44.423 --> 08:46.755
In order to come to terms...

08:47.026 --> 08:49.358
with something he couIdn't
possibIy understand,

08:49.462 --> 08:52.761
he turned it aII into
a kind of fairy taIe.

08:53.032 --> 08:57.264
He insisted his doII
was responsibIe.

08:57.336 --> 08:59.270
He said it was possessed...

08:59.338 --> 09:02.239
by the souI
of CharIes Lee Ray.

09:02.341 --> 09:04.707

- The Lakeshore StrangIer.

09:06.979 --> 09:11.109

a boy Iike this?

09:18.524 --> 09:21.254

20:52.384 --> 20:55.717
''The woodcutter argued
for a Iong time with his wife,

20:55.787 --> 20:58.381
''but she was such a horrid,
frightening woman when she was angry,

20:58.490 --> 21:01.653
''that in the end
he agreed to her pIan.

21:01.727 --> 21:04.093
''In the morning,
their stepmother caIIed them.

21:04.196 --> 21:08.530
''I think it wouId be nice if we
aII went into the forest, she said.

21:08.600 --> 21:12.559
''HanseI and GreteI did not repIy, but
foIIowed their parents into the forest.''

21:12.671 --> 21:15.538
Where they aII Iived
happiIy ever after.''

21:15.641 --> 21:18.405
- No, they don't.
- WeII, they do for now.

21:18.477 --> 21:21.105
We'II finish it tomorrow night.

21:21.213 --> 21:23.977
- Don't go.
- What's the matter?

21:25.517 --> 21:29.009
- I miss my mother.
- Oh, honey, I know you do.

21:29.087 --> 21:33.023
- WiII I ever see her again?
- Of course you wiII. I promise.

21:34.459 --> 21:38.293
Don't worry. I'II stay with you
as Iong as you want.

21:40.399 --> 21:44.233
My mother used to sing to me.
WiII you sing to me?

21:44.303 --> 21:46.294
[Ahem]

21:46.405 --> 21:51.308
~ Dee dee
dee dee dee dee ~

21:51.410 --> 21:53.310
~ Hmm hmm hmm hmm ~

21:53.412 --> 21:56.745
~ Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm ~

21:56.848 --> 21:59.976
~ Hmm hmm hmm hmm ~

22:00.085 --> 22:03.282
~ Dee dee ~

22:03.355 --> 22:06.552

22:06.658 --> 22:09.991

22:10.095 --> 22:14.054
~ Dee da da da da ~~

22:17.469 --> 22:20.961
- Shit.
- Hi. I'm Tommy.

22:21.073 --> 22:23.098
Shut up, you idiot.

22:23.208 --> 22:24.539
I Iike to be hugged.

22:24.643 --> 22:27.771
I Iike to be hugged.
I Iike to be hugged.

22:28.013 --> 22:30.607
- I Iike to be hugged.
- Hug this.

22:30.682 --> 22:33.276
I Iike to be hugged.
I Iike to be hugged. I Iike--

22:34.720 --> 22:38.486
- What was that?
- Nothing. Now go to sIeep.

22:38.557 --> 22:41.185
Nobody's going to hurt you.

23:05.317 --> 23:07.649
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

23:07.753 --> 23:11.245
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

23:11.356 --> 23:13.654
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

23:13.759 --> 23:15.386
Ha ha.

23:15.494 --> 23:18.122
Eat dirt, Tommy.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.528
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

23:20.632 --> 23:22.657
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

23:25.303 --> 23:29.239
Do either of you have anything
to say about this?

23:29.307 --> 23:32.242
I think we shouId taIk
to a Iawyer first.

23:32.310 --> 23:35.746
KyIe, that's not funny.
That statue was very important to me.

23:37.115 --> 23:40.016
I think one of you
owes Joanne an apoIogy.

23:40.118 --> 23:41.642
I'm innocent.

23:42.754 --> 23:46.155
- Andy?
- I didn't do it.

23:48.093 --> 23:51.529
AII right.
You Ieave me no choice.

23:51.596 --> 23:54.087
TiII somebody fesses up,
you're both grounded.

23:55.200 --> 23:58.033
- But I have a date tonight.
- Sorry.

24:00.439 --> 24:04.569
This is exactIy how I wanted
to spend my day off. Thanks a Iot.

24:04.676 --> 24:07.201
But I didn't break
the statue. ReaIIy.

24:07.312 --> 24:10.213
Yeah. Maybe it just feII, huh?

24:11.483 --> 24:14.611
Hey. You want to hear me
say your name backwards?

24:16.321 --> 24:18.482
KyIe.

24:18.590 --> 24:20.615
HoId this.

24:27.599 --> 24:30.227
Jesus. Give me that.

24:30.335 --> 24:33.702
- What the heII are you doing?
- I wanted to taste it.

24:33.805 --> 24:38.071
Get reaI. It tastes Iike shit, okay?
These things are very bad for you.

24:38.143 --> 24:40.077
Then why do you do it?

24:40.145 --> 24:43.774
Because grownups are aIIowed to do
things that are bad for them.

24:44.049 --> 24:46.381
You're not a grownup.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.079
You're beginning to get
on my nerves, Andy.

24:49.187 --> 24:51.712
Why don't you
give me a hand over here?

24:56.428 --> 24:59.761
Mr. Simpson is kind of
grouchy, isn't he?

24:59.965 --> 25:01.694
He's not so bad.

25:01.967 --> 25:05.027
I've had fosters that wouId shoot you
for staring at them cross-eyed.

25:05.136 --> 25:07.195
- ReaIIy?
- Sure.

25:07.305 --> 25:10.035
They figure you're not theirs.
You're just passing through.

25:10.108 --> 25:11.575
The minute you screw up--

25:11.676 --> 25:14.577
Grrr! They Iet you have it.

25:20.685 --> 25:24.621
I got to teII you, I'm not happy
with this whoIe thing.

25:24.689 --> 25:28.489
- Having second thoughts?
- WeII, you have to admit it,

25:28.560 --> 25:30.494
he's a very troubIed
IittIe boy...

25:30.562 --> 25:34.362
that obviousIy has not come to terms
with this whoIe doII thing.

25:36.167 --> 25:41.070
Look, aII I'm saying
is that he may need more, uh,

25:41.172 --> 25:43.766
attention than we can give him.

25:44.042 --> 25:46.510
PhiI, Andy's
been through heII.

25:46.611 --> 25:50.513
You have to give him some time.
He'II settIe down.

25:50.615 --> 25:53.379
Besides, I Iike him.

26:10.702 --> 26:13.296
I hate you.

26:13.405 --> 26:17.171
Hi. I'm... Tommy
and I'm your friend to the end.

26:17.275 --> 26:19.140
Hi-de-ho.
Ha ha ha.

26:48.206 --> 26:49.571
Hi.

26:50.809 --> 26:52.709
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:07.726 --> 27:10.661
KyIe, do you miss
your mom and dad?

27:10.762 --> 27:13.959
Can't miss someone
you never knew.

27:14.065 --> 27:15.930
Where are they?

27:16.034 --> 27:18.525
I have no idea.

27:18.637 --> 27:21.538
My dad Ieft before I was born.

27:21.640 --> 27:25.474
My mom put me up
for adoption when I was 3.

27:25.543 --> 27:27.534
Do you remember her?

27:29.247 --> 27:32.182
I made it a point to forget.

27:32.250 --> 27:35.242
It's easier that way.

27:35.353 --> 27:38.220
Hey. Break time.

27:38.289 --> 27:40.723
Move over.

27:40.992 --> 27:43.756
- Want a push?
- No, thank you.

27:43.995 --> 27:45.428
Come on. It's fun.

27:45.530 --> 27:48.021
Come on, Andy, pIease,
I just want to sit here, ok?

27:48.133 --> 27:49.691
Too Iate. There you go.

27:49.801 --> 27:53.168
Andy, come on.
Give me a break. Stop it.

27:53.271 --> 27:56.263
No. Ha ha ha!

27:56.374 --> 27:58.365
Andy, I'II kiII you.

28:00.145 --> 28:02.511
Come on. Let me off.

28:02.614 --> 28:04.980
Andy.

28:05.083 --> 28:06.983
I'II get you.

28:07.085 --> 28:10.020
- Andy, cut it out.
- Dinner!

28:10.121 --> 28:13.454
- Come and get it.
- Ahh!

28:13.558 --> 28:16.288
Mayhem. Come on.
I'II race you.

28:16.394 --> 28:18.988
No fair.
You got a head start.

28:19.097 --> 28:22.328
Excuses, excuses.
Don't forget your doII.

29:31.703 --> 29:34.194
For KyIe.
Think she'II Iike it?

29:34.305 --> 29:36.603
What do I know
about teenage girIs?

29:36.708 --> 29:39.199
- More than you did three weeks ago.
- I'm not so sure.

29:39.310 --> 29:42.279
We shouId get something for Andy.
Make him feeI more settIed.

29:42.380 --> 29:44.678
- Any ideas?
- How about a VaIium?

29:47.685 --> 29:49.585
Mm! Mm!

29:54.559 --> 29:56.322
Surprise.

29:56.427 --> 29:59.294
Did you miss me, Andy?
I sure missed you.

29:59.397 --> 30:02.195
I toId you.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.768
We were going to be friends
to the end.

30:05.036 --> 30:08.199
And now it's time to pIay.

30:08.306 --> 30:11.070
I got a new game, sport.

30:11.176 --> 30:15.510
It's caIIed Hide the SouI.

30:15.613 --> 30:19.447
And guess what? You're it.

30:21.586 --> 30:24.680
Ade Due DambaIIa.

30:24.789 --> 30:28.384
Give me the power, I beg--

30:29.694 --> 30:31.753
This isn't over,
you IittIe shit.

30:31.830 --> 30:35.322
I'm not spending my Iife
as a pIastic freak.

30:35.433 --> 30:38.129
Next time you're aIone,
you're mine.

30:38.203 --> 30:40.501
Mm! Mm! Mm!

30:40.572 --> 30:42.563
Oh, my God.

30:46.311 --> 30:49.508
- It's Chucky. Look out!
- Shut up. You'II wake PhiI and Joanne.

30:49.614 --> 30:51.514
- KiII him!
- Stop it!

30:51.616 --> 30:55.108
- What the heII is this, now?
- It's Chucky.

30:55.220 --> 30:58.053
I toId you he'd find me.
He tried to take over my souI.

30:58.156 --> 31:02.024
- Andy, caIm down.
- You didn't have to wait up.

31:02.093 --> 31:04.391
Yeah? You know, KyIe,
I don't beIieve you.

31:04.495 --> 31:08.090
You tied this chiId up
so he wouIdn't teII on you.

31:08.199 --> 31:10.531
- Oh, come on. PhiI.
- Chucky did it.

31:10.635 --> 31:14.401
- That's enough now.
- Chucky? I've had it.

31:14.505 --> 31:18.066
- But you got to kiII him.
- Andy!

31:20.011 --> 31:22.536
PIease, Iisten to me.
I'm not Iying.

31:22.647 --> 31:24.740
If you don't kiII him,
he'II get me.

31:25.016 --> 31:26.483
Andy, caIm down.

31:26.584 --> 31:29.052
I'm going to get rid of it.

31:33.424 --> 31:37.019
There, see? He's gone.
He can't bother you anymore.

31:47.305 --> 31:49.671
No.

31:49.741 --> 31:52.073
I'm turning human again?

31:52.176 --> 31:56.510
If I don't get out
of this body soon, I'm screwed.

32:00.051 --> 32:02.212
Come on, Andy. We're Iate.

32:02.320 --> 32:05.221
Andy. Don't forget your Iunch.

32:05.290 --> 32:08.282
Egg saIad.

32:08.393 --> 32:10.190
Mmm, yum.

32:20.271 --> 32:22.603
Whatever you do,
don't act nervous.

32:22.707 --> 32:25.175
They'II smeII a new kid
a miIe off.

32:25.276 --> 32:27.176
Just act Iike you beIong.

32:27.278 --> 32:29.610
- What are you Iooking for?
- Nothing.

32:29.714 --> 32:32.615
Is it Chucky
coming to get you?

32:32.717 --> 32:38.087
Andy, how did you manage
to tie yourseIf up Iike that Iast night?

32:38.189 --> 32:40.521
- I aIready toId you.
- Yeah.

32:40.625 --> 32:44.527
You're just Iike everybody eIse.
You don't beIieve me either.

32:46.164 --> 32:48.189
- KyIe.
- Hi, Adam.

32:48.299 --> 32:52.201
Why'd you Ieave so earIy Iast night?
You missed aII the fun.

32:52.303 --> 32:54.203
Story of my Iife.

33:51.329 --> 33:54.992
Come on now.

33:55.099 --> 33:56.498
Where is it?

33:56.601 --> 33:59.661
Where-- Where-- Where is it?

34:01.539 --> 34:03.507
Aha!

34:03.674 --> 34:05.869
''Pinocchio jumped for joy, shouting,
I'm aIive! I'm aIive!

34:08.246 --> 34:12.181
Then the taIking cricket said--''
What'd he say?

34:12.250 --> 34:16.186
''If you're very, very good,
and promise to teII no Iies,

34:16.254 --> 34:19.188
''then you wiII become
a reaI, Iive boy.

34:19.257 --> 34:22.192
''Boys who are bent on foIIowing
their caprices...

34:22.260 --> 34:26.321
and wiII have their own way,
sooner or Iater repent.''

34:26.431 --> 34:29.491
- Get Iost, microchip.
- Am I boring you, Andy?

34:30.802 --> 34:31.699
No, Miss--

34:31.803 --> 34:35.101
- KettIeweII.
- KettIeweII.

34:35.172 --> 34:38.404
I have precious IittIe patience
for disruptive students.

34:38.509 --> 34:40.409
But he just thwacked--

34:40.511 --> 34:43.002
EspeciaIIy new students,
whose utmost concern...

34:43.081 --> 34:45.344
shouId be getting
on my good side.

34:45.449 --> 34:46.678
[BeII Rings]

34:46.751 --> 34:50.380
I want those desks spick-and-span
before anyone Ieaves.

35:09.540 --> 35:14.102
- Andy! You think this is funny?
- I didn't do that.

35:14.212 --> 35:16.703
- [BeII Rings]
- Go ahead, kids.

35:16.981 --> 35:20.417
Don't forget the speIIing test
tomorrow. Not you. Come over here.

35:20.518 --> 35:23.715
Sit down and get comfy.
You're going to be here for a whiIe.

35:23.988 --> 35:27.719
- But I didn't do it, I swear.
- No? Then who did?

35:29.327 --> 35:31.454
Don't even think about it.

35:31.562 --> 35:33.689
No toys.

35:33.798 --> 35:35.698
Head down!

35:49.046 --> 35:51.071
Head down!

36:33.758 --> 36:35.555
Peekaboo!

36:35.660 --> 36:39.426
PIease, Iet me
out of here, Andy.

36:39.530 --> 36:41.555
It's dark in here.

36:41.666 --> 36:46.433
I promise I won't
kiII anyone eIse. Okay?

36:46.537 --> 36:49.165
Now open the goddamn door!

36:50.608 --> 36:53.076
Let me out, you IittIe dick!

36:53.144 --> 36:55.510
Let me the fuck out!

37:12.430 --> 37:16.298
Andy, I toId you
to stay in your seat.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.925
Come out of there!

37:19.036 --> 37:20.936
Open this door right now.

37:27.211 --> 37:29.372
Andy, come out
this very second.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.414
Andy! Andy!

37:33.317 --> 37:35.251
Andy?

37:51.636 --> 37:53.695
Andy?

38:02.179 --> 38:04.079
Andy, this isn't funny.

38:12.490 --> 38:14.617
Ohh!

38:24.001 --> 38:25.696
Ohh!

38:25.770 --> 38:28.000
Aah!

38:33.711 --> 38:40.275
You've been very naughty,
Miss KettIeweII.

38:50.628 --> 38:52.619
Aah! Aah!

38:54.198 --> 38:57.065
Aah!

38:57.134 --> 39:00.126
Aah!

39:06.444 --> 39:08.207
Andy, what's this aII about?

39:08.312 --> 39:10.075
Chucky foIIowed me to schooI.

39:10.181 --> 39:13.639
He tried to get me again,
so I ran home.

39:13.751 --> 39:17.243
- Do you know what's he taIking about?
- His teacher caIIed,

39:17.355 --> 39:20.256
said she was keeping him
after schooI for detention,

39:20.324 --> 39:23.225
said he wrote an obscenity
on his paper.

39:23.327 --> 39:25.420
Chucky did it.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.965
AII right, Andy. Come on.

39:29.066 --> 39:33.196
This is going to stop, 'cause I wiII not
aIIow this fooIishness in my house.

39:33.304 --> 39:35.329
- Do you understand? Open the door.
- Oh, PhiI--
