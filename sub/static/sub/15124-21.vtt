WEBVTT

00:02.203 --> 00:04.138
* Whoo!

00:04.172 --> 00:05.573
* Here we go

00:05.606 --> 00:08.609
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

00:11.379 --> 00:14.215
Make room, precious cargo
coming through.

00:14.248 --> 00:16.050
Why is there a ham
in Hope's car seat?

00:16.084 --> 00:18.052
Now you got to put
your ham in a car seat?

00:18.086 --> 00:19.720
I knew this would happen
the minute they put

00:19.753 --> 00:21.522
a Democrat in the White House.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.724
We wanted to make sure that it
got home safe from the butcher.

00:23.757 --> 00:27.195
This holiday dinner
has to be perfect.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.230
You don't have to work so hard
to impress my parents, Virginia.

00:29.263 --> 00:31.132
They gave up on us
a long time ago.

00:31.165 --> 00:32.333
(doorbell rings)
Oh, that's them.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.601
Best behavior, everybody.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.369
No offense, Hope.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.238
Grandma's got to toss out
your splotchy brown eggs.

00:37.271 --> 00:38.706
Next week we'll go
back to pretending

00:38.739 --> 00:40.374
everything you
do is wonderful.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.246
Mom, Dad.

00:45.279 --> 00:46.347
(laughs)

00:46.380 --> 00:47.548
What's up, Grammy?

00:47.581 --> 00:48.849
Oh, hi, Jimmy.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.218
And, uh...?

00:50.251 --> 00:51.352
It's Sabrina.

00:51.385 --> 00:55.223
Oh. Hi, Sabrina.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.725
Anyway, uh, we're really
sorry that you couldn't

00:57.758 --> 00:59.160
make it to the wedding.

00:59.193 --> 01:00.694
Well, we would've RSVP'd,

01:00.728 --> 01:03.164
but we're boycotting
the post office.

01:03.197 --> 01:05.266
They gave 40 million
of our tax dollars

01:05.299 --> 01:08.202
to some blood-doping cheater
riding a bike all over France.

01:08.236 --> 01:10.271
I saw that on Oprah.

01:10.304 --> 01:11.805
Well, that guy's got
a lot of ball.

01:11.839 --> 01:14.275
Yeah.
Christine, Ralph,

01:14.308 --> 01:15.476
can I interest you in some

01:15.509 --> 01:18.246
Easter Island head cheese
and crackers?

01:18.279 --> 01:19.113
Oh, yeah.

01:19.147 --> 01:20.281
Oh.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.715
CHRISTINE:
Look, we have some

01:21.749 --> 01:23.284
big news. (laughs)

01:23.317 --> 01:24.818
Maybe we should all sit down.

01:24.852 --> 01:27.288
Oh, no, are you dying?

01:27.321 --> 01:29.390
Or you're both dying.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.658
Or you're getting divorced.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.293
Oh, Mom, did you finally
find that picture

01:32.326 --> 01:34.228
of Dad wearing that black dress?

01:34.262 --> 01:36.297
Nobody's dying
and nobody's divorcing.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.666
And that black dress
is a graduation gown.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.601
You'd know that if you ever
graduated from anything.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.770
Well, so what's
the big news?

01:42.803 --> 01:45.573
About two weeks ago,
we went to a bar mitzvah,

01:45.606 --> 01:47.641
and I was talking
to the Goldbergs

01:47.675 --> 01:50.311
and realized we had
a cousin in common.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.612
RALPH:
After blowing
a hundred dollars

01:51.645 --> 01:53.214
on a genealogist,

01:53.247 --> 01:55.816
your mother discovers
she's Jewish.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.585
(little laugh)
CHRISTINE: And, Burt,

01:57.618 --> 01:59.187
according to tradition,

01:59.220 --> 02:00.588
so are you.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.156
You're Jewish.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.757
Oh, crap.

02:03.791 --> 02:04.792
Well, now I'm gonna have
to go punch Frank

02:04.825 --> 02:07.828
for that hilarious joke
he told me last week.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.797
Does that mean that we get to
have those little prayer rugs

02:09.830 --> 02:11.299
and pray five times a day?

02:11.332 --> 02:12.933
I don't feel Jewish.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.768
Maybe that's why they
call it Jewish.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.637
Because when people find out,
they don't feel full Jew.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.239
They feel Jew-ish.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.640
You should do what I've done.

02:19.673 --> 02:22.310
Embrace your new heritage.

02:22.343 --> 02:23.377
Connect with your people.

02:23.411 --> 02:24.845
Learn your history.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.880
But most importantly,

02:26.914 --> 02:29.817
do what every
good Jewish boy does.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.552
Get bar mitzvahed.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.387
Whoa, slow down now...

02:33.421 --> 02:35.856
You're asking me to throw
everything I know to be true

02:35.889 --> 02:37.525
about Santa Claus
and the Easter Bunny

02:37.558 --> 02:39.527
and just accept
some crazy new religion?

02:40.728 --> 02:42.696
I'm not sure I
want to do that.

02:42.730 --> 02:45.199
Okay, fine.

02:45.233 --> 02:46.300
Don't do it.

02:46.334 --> 02:47.701
If you want

02:47.735 --> 02:48.869
to break your mother's heart,

02:48.902 --> 02:50.671
I guess I can't stop you.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.206
My happiness

02:52.240 --> 02:53.841
means nothing,
it's more important

02:53.874 --> 02:55.576
that you get what-what you want.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.345
Oh...

02:57.378 --> 02:58.846
Ever since your mother
found out she's Jewish,

02:58.879 --> 03:00.581
she really knows how
to lay on the guilt.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.216
CHRISTINE:
All I ask

03:02.250 --> 03:03.551
is if you care one...

03:03.584 --> 03:06.387
one iota about your mother,

03:06.420 --> 03:07.788
you'll think about it.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.824
Fine, I'll think about it.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.294
I know you'll come
to the right decision.

03:13.327 --> 03:14.362
VIRGINIA:
Look.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.230
In the meantime,

03:16.264 --> 03:17.731
your guests in our home,

03:17.765 --> 03:21.235
and I have planned
the greatest Easter feast

03:21.269 --> 03:23.337
our family has ever had.

03:23.371 --> 03:24.605
Oh, it sounds great,

03:24.638 --> 03:25.706
but, uh,

03:25.739 --> 03:27.541
we no longer celebrate Easter.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.243
We're Passover people.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.580
Since we're all
sharing secrets,

03:32.613 --> 03:34.282
maybe it's time
I told you which side

03:34.315 --> 03:36.950
of World War II
Wilfred fought on.

03:36.984 --> 03:39.219
Japanese.

03:41.755 --> 03:44.358
Passover-- I don't even
know what Passover is.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.026
Me, neither.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.861
It's weird.

03:47.895 --> 03:50.298
This morning I was just
a normal, average guy,

03:50.331 --> 03:52.900
but tonight I'm a Jew.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.869
Maybe this could be
good for you.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.939
Different songs, more holidays.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.375
And I'm sure there's some
amazing Passover recipe

04:01.409 --> 04:03.411
for that Easter ham I bought.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.813
I guess we just got to take it
one step at a time.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.815
Keep asking ourselves,

04:07.848 --> 04:10.351
"What would Jesus do?"

04:22.095 --> 04:24.832
Okay, when it's our turn,

04:24.865 --> 04:25.999
you ask about
the Jewish stuff.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.368
Me?
Yeah.

04:27.401 --> 04:28.836
You're the one
who's Jewish.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.504
But that's what
makes it weird.
What?

04:30.538 --> 04:32.306
Now you go.

04:32.340 --> 04:33.574
Can I help you boys?

04:33.607 --> 04:35.743
Hi, I'm Burt.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.679
I'll take, uh, half a pound
of the corned beef,

04:38.712 --> 04:40.348
three of those
little sausages,

04:40.381 --> 04:42.816
some of that pink fish,

04:42.850 --> 04:44.485
and two of those giant pickles,

04:44.518 --> 04:46.620
a full explanation of what
it means to be a Jew,

04:46.654 --> 04:49.457
and two of those
brown and white cookies.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.525
The explanation
of Judaism comes with a side.

04:51.559 --> 04:54.528
Would you like coleslaw
or potato salad?

04:56.497 --> 04:58.332
Okay, you try.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.935
(laughs)

05:01.969 --> 05:03.671
My father recently found out
that he's Jewish,

05:03.704 --> 05:06.507
and he's looking
for a little information.

05:06.540 --> 05:09.343
Hey, Rose,
Burt here wants to know

05:09.377 --> 05:12.112
what it means to be a
member of the tribe.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.081
Well, tickle my kishkas--
hit it.

05:15.416 --> 05:18.552
* 5,000 some odd years ago

05:18.586 --> 05:21.489
* Abraham and sons

05:21.522 --> 05:24.358
* Found a God,
said "Hey, we're Jews *

05:24.392 --> 05:26.827
* And we're the chosen ones"

05:26.860 --> 05:29.463
* They moved around,
and customs grew *

05:29.497 --> 05:32.500
* Enslaved by Romans,
Persians, too *

05:32.533 --> 05:35.369
* But sense of humor
got them through *

05:35.403 --> 05:36.704
BOTH:
* Now here's what makes

05:36.737 --> 05:41.375
* A Jew a Jew...

05:43.544 --> 05:45.413
* To be a Jew
you have to eat *

05:45.446 --> 05:47.581
* It's always salty,
sometimes sweet *

05:47.615 --> 05:49.750
* I'll go grab a knife
and fork *

05:49.783 --> 05:52.019
* But don't eat lobster,
shrimp or pork *

05:52.052 --> 05:53.987
* There's babke, brisket,
hamantaschen *

05:54.021 --> 05:55.989
* Pickled herring
you can nosh-on *

05:56.023 --> 05:57.491
* Kreplach, kugel,
mandelbrodt *

05:57.525 --> 06:00.394
* Gefilte fish and lox
Hey!

06:00.428 --> 06:02.162
* Don't stop there,
there's matzo brei *

06:02.195 --> 06:03.864
* And lean pastrami
piled on rye *

06:03.897 --> 06:07.100
* Blintzes, challah, macaroons,
and bagels by the box *

06:07.134 --> 06:09.503
* Hey
* Traditions endless,
history long *

06:09.537 --> 06:11.539
* But perfect
for a deli song *

06:11.572 --> 06:13.474
* Listen, Burt,
we're teaching you *

06:13.507 --> 06:15.543
* Just what makes
a Jew a Jew *

06:17.545 --> 06:19.413
Dad, this is
pretty incredible.

06:19.447 --> 06:20.581
I had no idea.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.182
Neither did I.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.852
* So what is in
a Jewish home? *

06:24.885 --> 06:26.420
* Lots of silver,
never chrome *

06:26.454 --> 06:28.589
* A lot of tchotchkes
in the mix? *

06:28.622 --> 06:30.558
* Yes, but not a crucifix

06:30.591 --> 06:32.192
* There's dreidels,
yarmulkes, menorahs *

06:32.225 --> 06:34.027
* Stars of David,
maybe Torahs *

06:34.061 --> 06:35.796
* Bubbe's china,
kiddush cups *

06:35.829 --> 06:37.565
* And Seinfeld on TV *
Hey!

06:37.598 --> 06:39.433
* Mezuzah hanging
by the door *

06:39.467 --> 06:41.469
* Hired help
to sweep the floor *

06:41.502 --> 06:42.970
* Books about the Holocaust

06:43.003 --> 06:44.972
* And Streisand on CD
Hey!

06:45.005 --> 06:46.574
* The people short,
the beards are long *

06:46.607 --> 06:48.576
* Perfect for a deli song

06:48.609 --> 06:50.578
* Listen, Burt,
we're teaching you *

06:50.611 --> 06:52.780
* Just what makes a Jew a Jew

07:05.926 --> 07:09.930
* Overbearing mothers

07:09.963 --> 07:13.501
* Movie-making brothers

07:13.534 --> 07:16.169
* Fathers who earn money

07:16.203 --> 07:20.474
* Schlubby sisters
who are funny *

07:20.508 --> 07:23.110
* Traditions endless,
history long *

07:23.143 --> 07:25.479
* But perfect for a deli song

07:25.513 --> 07:27.615
* Listen, Burt,
we're teaching you *

07:27.648 --> 07:29.750
* Just what makes a Jew a Jew

07:29.783 --> 07:31.151
* Eating rye and pumpernickel

07:31.184 --> 07:33.086
* But no foreskin
on their pickle *

07:33.120 --> 07:34.622
* Listen, Burt,
we're teaching you *

07:34.655 --> 07:36.990
* Listen, Burt, we're
teaching you *

07:37.024 --> 07:38.926
* I think I know now,
guys, I do *

07:38.959 --> 07:40.594
* Just what makes

07:40.628 --> 07:46.266
* A Jew a Jew...

07:46.299 --> 07:47.835
"La chi-um!"

07:47.868 --> 07:48.969
VIRGINIA:
You're telling me

07:49.002 --> 07:51.572
everyone broke
out into song?

07:51.605 --> 07:52.873
Even the bagels?

07:52.906 --> 07:54.007
That's how I remember it.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.509
We're a very creative people.

07:55.543 --> 07:56.944
Plus after they
stopped singing,

07:56.977 --> 07:59.647
we sat down, we kibbitzed--
which means "talked"--

07:59.680 --> 08:01.181
they told me all about
their customs and traditions.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.650
They even explained
the whole process

08:02.683 --> 08:03.784
of getting bar mitzvahed.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.553
Oh, really, what is it?
Turns out,

08:05.586 --> 08:06.987
a bar mitzvah's, like,
a right of passage.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.956
You go from being a boy
to a man.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.024
Burt, come on,
you're already a man.

08:11.058 --> 08:13.160
Am I?
Think about it, Virginia.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.628
I never graduated high school.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.530
Heck, I never even finished
that book report

08:16.564 --> 08:17.631
on people from Finland.

08:17.665 --> 08:19.667
I never even learned
what they're called.

08:19.700 --> 08:20.701
Finnish.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.202
I'm trying to.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.671
I never followed
through on anything

08:23.704 --> 08:25.072
because I never
became a man.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.674
I think I need
to get bar mitzvahed.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.543
Are you sure you
really want to do this?

08:29.577 --> 08:31.679
The Jewish thing
is a lot of work.

08:31.712 --> 08:34.915
Trust me, I'm planning a seder,
and I can't find anything

08:34.948 --> 08:38.686
on Paula Dean's
Web site I can use.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.721
Bubbe, Zayde,

08:40.754 --> 08:41.822
I got big news.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.724
I am gonna get bar mitzvahed.

08:43.757 --> 08:45.893
Our son's finally
becoming a man.

08:45.926 --> 08:48.629
Oh, yes, you are.

08:48.662 --> 08:51.031
(laughs)

08:55.603 --> 08:57.037
RABBI:
When the-- Oh!

08:57.070 --> 08:58.639
Come in, come in,
come in.

08:58.672 --> 08:59.940
Kids, this is Burt Chance.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.875
He's gonna be
joining our class.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.877
While you've all had six
months to study and prepare,

09:03.911 --> 09:05.579
he has a week.

09:05.613 --> 09:06.847
Um, my parents are in town.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.649
They really want me
to become a man,

09:08.682 --> 09:10.283
which I thought we covered
when I got married

09:10.317 --> 09:11.719
and had a kid at 17.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.286
Wear condoms, boys.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.188
All right, then. Uh,

09:15.222 --> 09:16.690
why don't you have
a seat here, Burt?

09:16.724 --> 09:18.091
And, uh, put this on.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.627
Here you go.
(laughs)

09:19.660 --> 09:20.694
Let's get started.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.295
Put this on, mm-hmm.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.632
Burt, you're going
to have to read

09:24.665 --> 09:26.600
from the Torah as part
of your bar mitzvah.

09:26.634 --> 09:28.802
Now, it's in Hebrew, so it's
gonna take a lot of work.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.904
Repeat after me.

09:30.938 --> 09:32.072
"Baruch."

09:32.105 --> 09:33.774
Barack.
More in the throat.

09:33.807 --> 09:34.975
Baruch.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.777
Baruch... (throaty grunting)

09:36.810 --> 09:38.378
(boys laughing)
Kids, kids, come on.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.713
Come on. Chechen.

09:39.747 --> 09:40.948
Let's try another one, Burt.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.149
How about this? "Melach."

09:42.182 --> 09:43.684
Melick.
Again.

09:43.717 --> 09:44.785
From the throat.

09:44.818 --> 09:45.919
(throaty):
Huh, huh, huh.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.755
(throaty):
Huh, huh...

09:47.788 --> 09:50.924
(hawking, coughing)

09:50.958 --> 09:52.960
(boys laughing)

09:52.993 --> 09:54.662
Please, please.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.096
You're gonna get
schmutz everywhere, all right?

09:56.129 --> 09:57.330
Kids,

09:57.364 --> 09:58.398
why don't you
all go outside

09:58.431 --> 10:00.668
and play a game of basketball.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.670
First team to 11 wins.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.806
(door closes)

10:05.839 --> 10:07.240
Okay, that should give us
about three hours.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.608
Let's get to work.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.814
SABRINA:
Good afternoon, ladies.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.949
Might I interest you
in a sample sausage?

10:15.983 --> 10:17.818
Is it kosher?

10:17.851 --> 10:19.920
(laughing):
I'm not even sure
it's real meat.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.822
Thank you, dear,
we'll pass.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.691
So, what brings you guys
into Howdy's this afternoon?

10:23.724 --> 10:26.694
Well, my mother-in-law
insisted that we shop

10:26.727 --> 10:28.428
for the seder
dinner together.

10:28.461 --> 10:31.031
I was just trying
to help, I...

10:31.064 --> 10:34.301
Look, if-if I'm in the way,
I-I can wait outside.

10:34.334 --> 10:37.671
My people spent four decades
in the burning desert,

10:37.705 --> 10:39.840
and I think I can last

10:39.873 --> 10:42.309
20 minutes schvitzing
in a hot car.

10:42.342 --> 10:43.877
Follow me.

10:43.911 --> 10:46.446
Uh, so all of
our Jewish foods

10:46.479 --> 10:48.115
are over here
surrounded by

10:48.148 --> 10:50.017
the Syrian and Egyptian foods.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.720
Oh, the way I see it, if the
pitas and the matzohs can sit

10:52.753 --> 10:55.455
peacefully side by side, maybe
there's hope for the world.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.858
Well, I'm just staring
at funny-named foods

10:57.891 --> 10:59.026
with funny-shaped letters.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.794
I don't know how
to make a seder dinner.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.362
Allow me to help.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.900
* My ex-wife
was very cruel *

11:06.934 --> 11:09.069
* Bordering on shrewish

11:09.102 --> 11:11.471
* But luckily for all of you

11:11.504 --> 11:13.707
* She happened to be Jewish

11:13.741 --> 11:15.776
* We never really
talked at all *

11:15.809 --> 11:18.145
* I barely ever laid her

11:18.178 --> 11:20.147
* But I did get
one thing out of it *

11:20.180 --> 11:22.850
* I learned to make a seder

11:22.883 --> 11:24.752
* She doesn't know
which foods to buy *

11:24.785 --> 11:26.920
* She doesn't know
what to fixah *

11:26.954 --> 11:29.156
* She needs someone
to help her out *

11:29.189 --> 11:31.391
* I'm just a silly shiksa

11:31.424 --> 11:33.493
BARNEY:
* It really is quite simple

11:33.526 --> 11:35.763
* You cook and tell a story

11:35.796 --> 11:37.731
* The food will
give you heartburn *

11:37.765 --> 11:40.167
* The tale is very gory

11:40.200 --> 11:42.502
* Let's eat
* Let's eat

11:42.535 --> 11:44.738
* Let's have a seder

11:44.772 --> 11:46.874
* First we'll tell the story

11:46.907 --> 11:48.776
* And we'll have
the dinner later *

11:50.911 --> 11:53.346
* Pharaoh was
a great big jerk *

11:53.380 --> 11:55.348
* He told the Jews
to get to work *

11:55.382 --> 11:58.051
* But Moses had God
on his side *

11:58.085 --> 12:00.020
* Bada-bing, infanticide

12:00.053 --> 12:02.055
* The Jews fled
from the Pharaoh *

12:02.089 --> 12:04.792
* That guy,
he sounds oppressive *

12:04.825 --> 12:06.393
CHRISTINE:
* Then Moses parted
the Red Sea *

12:06.426 --> 12:08.796
* That's pretty darn
impressive *

12:08.829 --> 12:10.798
* Let's eat, let's eat

12:10.831 --> 12:13.200
* Let's have a seder

12:13.233 --> 12:15.202
* First we'll tell the story

12:15.235 --> 12:17.437
* And we'll have
the dinner later *

12:19.272 --> 12:22.142
* A shank bone
for the sacrifice *

12:22.175 --> 12:24.144
* I've heard that
kosher wine is nice *

12:24.177 --> 12:28.548
* Salty water to show the tears
of wandering for 40 years *

12:28.581 --> 12:30.550
* But now the story
has been told *

12:30.583 --> 12:33.486
* The Jews came out
the winner *

12:33.520 --> 12:35.155
* I'll schlep this stuff
back to my house *

12:35.188 --> 12:37.958
* And make a seder dinner

12:37.991 --> 12:39.927
* She'll schlep this stuff
back to her house *

12:39.960 --> 12:41.929
* She'll do it
for her Jewish spouse *

12:41.962 --> 12:44.164
* She'll schlep this stuff
back to her house *

12:44.197 --> 12:46.399
* I'll get drunk
and lose my blouse *

12:46.433 --> 12:48.235
* She'll schlep this stuff
back to her house *

12:48.268 --> 12:50.804
* And make a seder dinner

12:50.838 --> 12:51.939
* And make

12:51.972 --> 12:55.108
* A seder

12:55.142 --> 12:58.178
* Dinner.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.814
Molotov!

13:00.848 --> 13:03.951
And everybody
in Howdy's just joined in
singing and dancing?

13:03.984 --> 13:05.118
That's how
I remember it.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.419
I swear to God.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.956
My God and your God.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.524
CHRISTINE:
Burt, you got to see this!

13:12.559 --> 13:13.927
Great news, bubeleh.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.964
The RSVPs have
been flooding in.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.598
RALPH:
All our friends are

13:18.631 --> 13:20.367
tickled pink you're
gonna get bar mitzvahed.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.202
Some think it's
gonna be heartwarming.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.971
Others think it's gonna
be a train wreck.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.006
Either way, they're coming
to see what happens.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.307
You invited
all your friends?

13:27.340 --> 13:29.309
Well, when you've waited
over 40 years to see

13:29.342 --> 13:32.012
your son become a man,
you-you want to share it.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.914
(throaty):
Oh...

13:33.947 --> 13:35.015
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.049
No, no, I'm just practicing.

13:36.083 --> 13:37.617
I got a lot of studying to do.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.952
(car horn honks)
There's our taxi.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.553
Well, we're on
our way over

13:40.587 --> 13:42.956
to the Silvermans for something
called babke.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.392
That's apparently Jewish
for "dry cake."

13:45.425 --> 13:47.027
Uh, I haven't had
a healthy stool

13:47.060 --> 13:49.229
since your mother
changed religions.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.034
Dad?

13:54.067 --> 13:55.635
I can't do it, Jimmy.

13:55.668 --> 13:56.970
I got too much to learn.

13:57.004 --> 13:59.039
I haven't Schlemieled
or Schlimazeled,

13:59.072 --> 14:00.173
and I have no idea

14:00.207 --> 14:01.508
what Hasenpfeffer Incorporated
even makes.

14:01.541 --> 14:02.943
I got to find a way
out of this.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.177
Uh, hey,
maybe I can hide

14:04.211 --> 14:06.013
in the attic till
this whole thing blows over.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.048
I'm not gonna
let you give up, Dad.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.317
Did you let me quit T-ball
when I wanted to?
Yes.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.019
How about when I dropped
out of high school?

14:12.052 --> 14:13.887
I didn't say a word.

14:13.921 --> 14:15.655
Okay, well, what about the time
that I wanted to quit the thing

14:15.688 --> 14:18.158
at the hotel at the airport
that... what-what...

14:18.191 --> 14:20.227
what was it?
The seminar for enhancing
your memory?

14:20.260 --> 14:22.029
Yeah, I think that was it.
(groaning)

14:22.062 --> 14:23.430
Look, the point is

14:23.463 --> 14:26.066
I'm a quitter because
my dad never taught me

14:26.099 --> 14:27.267
how to follow through.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.602
All right, if you
never become a man,

14:29.636 --> 14:31.204
I'll never become a man.

14:31.238 --> 14:33.606
Ah, forget it, Jimmy.

14:34.942 --> 14:36.910
*

14:42.082 --> 14:44.017
* Forget the times

14:44.051 --> 14:46.519
* You quit before

14:46.553 --> 14:48.088
* Now pick yourself

14:48.121 --> 14:49.622
* Up off the floor

14:49.656 --> 14:51.524
* Today's your day

14:51.558 --> 14:53.626
* Feel the burn

14:53.660 --> 14:55.963
* It's just your brain

14:55.996 --> 14:58.198
* Trying to learn

14:58.231 --> 15:02.235
* They're gonna lift you up
high on a chair *

15:02.269 --> 15:06.006
* While we sing
and dance the hora *

15:06.039 --> 15:07.540
* You're gonna know every word

15:07.574 --> 15:09.709
* You're gonna know
all your prayers *

15:09.742 --> 15:11.411
* You ain't no schmendrik

15:11.444 --> 15:14.714
* You're gonna rock the Torah

15:14.747 --> 15:17.985
* I'm gonna rock the Torah

15:21.121 --> 15:25.025
* Read these words
as I unscroll it *

15:25.058 --> 15:26.159
* Don't hold back

15:26.193 --> 15:28.228
* Just rock and roll it

15:28.261 --> 15:31.564
* Write your speech
from the heart *

15:31.598 --> 15:36.336
* 'Cause a mensch don't stop
once he starts *

15:36.369 --> 15:40.407
* They're gonna lift you up
high on a chair *

15:40.440 --> 15:44.111
* While we sing
and dance the hora *

15:44.144 --> 15:45.678
* You're gonna know
every word *

15:45.712 --> 15:47.647
* You're gonna know
all your prayers *

15:47.680 --> 15:49.616
* You ain't no schmendrik

15:49.649 --> 15:53.186
* You're gonna rock the Torah

15:53.220 --> 15:58.358
* I'm gonna rock the Torah

16:05.798 --> 16:07.500
(spits)
MAN: Hey!

16:07.534 --> 16:09.602
* You've got the dreams

16:09.636 --> 16:14.641
* Of a man

16:14.674 --> 16:17.210
* And it's all part

16:17.244 --> 16:20.113
* Of God's plan

16:20.147 --> 16:21.781
(sings high note)

16:21.814 --> 16:24.351
* They're gonna lift you up

16:24.384 --> 16:26.553
* High on a chair

16:26.586 --> 16:30.323
* While we sing

16:30.357 --> 16:32.625
* You're gonna
know every word *

16:32.659 --> 16:34.294
* You're gonna know
all your prayers *

16:34.327 --> 16:36.096
* You ain't no schmendrik

16:36.129 --> 16:39.232
* You're gonna rock the Torah

16:39.266 --> 16:41.368
* They're gonna lift you up

16:41.401 --> 16:44.171

16:44.204 --> 16:47.640

16:47.674 --> 16:49.309
* You're gonna

16:49.342 --> 16:51.478
* You're gonna know

16:51.511 --> 16:53.313
* You ain't no schmendrik

16:53.346 --> 16:57.184
* You're gonna rock the Torah

16:57.217 --> 17:01.121
* I'm gonna rock
the Torah *

17:03.856 --> 17:05.658
JIMMY:
* C-Come on

17:05.692 --> 17:08.195
* Yeah, yeah

17:08.228 --> 17:10.163
* Yeah, yeah

17:10.197 --> 17:11.798
(whooping)

17:19.372 --> 17:21.208
Some old lady told me
to give this to you.

17:21.241 --> 17:24.377
That's nice.

17:24.411 --> 17:27.247
Hey, there's a couple
hundred bucks in here.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.715
It's bar mitzvah money.

17:28.748 --> 17:30.217
It's the first major payday
for a Jewish kid.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.252
With sound
investment strategy,

17:32.285 --> 17:34.087
some people turn that
into a nice little nest egg.

17:34.121 --> 17:35.622
I'm getting a Jet Ski.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.690
Why didn't my parents
tell me about this?

17:37.724 --> 17:40.227
They probably wanted you to do
it for the right reasons.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.428
You know, I thought
I knew my parents.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.763
Maybe I didn't give them
enough credit.

17:48.668 --> 17:50.637
(laughs)

17:50.670 --> 17:52.239
What the hell
are you guys doing?

17:52.272 --> 17:54.307
We're just welcoming
your guests, honey.

17:54.341 --> 17:55.642
You got a card
from the Bronsteins.

17:55.675 --> 17:56.643
Oh.

17:56.676 --> 17:59.112
Oh, dog with a "yar-mulkay."

17:59.146 --> 18:00.347
Funny.

18:01.348 --> 18:02.582
Where's the money?

18:02.615 --> 18:03.650
We know you've been stealing.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.218
We're not stealing anything.

18:05.252 --> 18:06.619
It's our money.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.655
Easy, honey,
we've come too far.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.590
What do you mean
"come too far"?

18:10.623 --> 18:12.459
Give me that money!
Burt, stop it!

18:12.492 --> 18:15.595
It's my money. I'm the one
getting bar mitzvahed.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.764
No, it's not, 'cause
you're not really Jewish.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.432
We made this whole thing up.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.238
Oi veh.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.212
What do you mean
I'm not Jewish?

18:32.245 --> 18:33.446
Okay.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.815
This may sound a little bit
selfish, but

18:35.848 --> 18:39.252
we came up with this great idea
to raise money for a cruise.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.754
Would that be a cruise to hell?

18:41.788 --> 18:43.456
Because I think that's where
you two are going.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.592
Look, Burt, for years

18:45.625 --> 18:47.827
your father and I have been
invited to weddings,

18:47.860 --> 18:49.429
graduations, bar mitzvahs.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.698
We've spent thousands
of dollars on gifts

18:51.731 --> 18:54.434
for our friends and their
horrible children.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.336
Oh, it's the Weinbergs.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.171
Thank you for sharing
our special day.

18:58.205 --> 18:59.506
You see them?

18:59.539 --> 19:02.209
Five kids-- they breed
like they're Irish.

19:02.242 --> 19:05.212
I mean, we laid out cash
for five bar mitzvahs,

19:05.245 --> 19:06.546
five graduations,
and five weddings.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.315
And you never even had one.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.949
This is a payback to us, son.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.318
Please don't blow it for us.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.485
*

19:12.519 --> 19:14.221
Sounds like
they're starting.

19:14.254 --> 19:15.655
Oh, make us proud,

19:15.688 --> 19:16.856
bubeleh.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.291
Have a good bar mitzvah.

19:21.228 --> 19:22.662
I can't believe
I was trying to get

19:22.695 --> 19:24.197
those schmendriks
to like me.

19:24.231 --> 19:25.498
You should go up there
and expose

19:25.532 --> 19:28.501
their whole meshugana scheme
to everyone.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.370
No.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.671
This is still my bar mitzvah.

19:31.704 --> 19:33.406
All these people came
to hear me.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.308
And for the first time
in my life,

19:35.342 --> 19:36.709
I'm gonna finish
what I started.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.716
So, I'd like to thank all of you
for coming here

19:43.750 --> 19:45.818
to share this
special day with me.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.354
But first,

19:47.387 --> 19:51.258
I have something I have
to say to my parents.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.825
I haven't exactly had
big events in my life

19:52.859 --> 19:54.494
that were worthy
of celebration.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.996
And I know that, uh,

19:57.029 --> 20:00.233
knocking up
my high school girlfriend...

20:00.267 --> 20:02.369
...and giving you
a great-grandchild

20:02.402 --> 20:05.238
whose mother
is a serial killer,

20:05.272 --> 20:07.540
aren't exactly reasons
to rent out a hall

20:07.574 --> 20:08.875
and have a chocolate fountain.

20:08.908 --> 20:11.010
So...

20:11.043 --> 20:13.913
I do this for you now.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.382
I love you.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.716
We're even.

20:18.451 --> 20:20.320
And so we begin.

20:24.291 --> 20:28.261
"Barutch atta adonay."

20:28.295 --> 20:31.264
Uh...moustache
with a squiggly line,

20:31.298 --> 20:32.299
"H" with a tail.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.301
"E-lo-hei-nu."

20:34.334 --> 20:35.935
El, el, hey, you.

20:35.968 --> 20:38.405
JIMMY: My dad
may have struggled,

20:38.438 --> 20:39.972
but he didn't give up,

20:40.006 --> 20:42.542
even when the rabbi corrected
every word he said

20:42.575 --> 20:43.910
for over three hours.

20:43.943 --> 20:47.414
L.O.L.
It's like a marathon.

20:47.447 --> 20:48.648
You don't have to win.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.383
The accomplishment
is finishing.

20:50.417 --> 20:53.953
And I've never been
more proud of my dad.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.922
That was amazing, Dad.

20:55.955 --> 20:58.658
And to think, you did all that
and you're not even Jewish.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.427
I'm sorry.

21:00.460 --> 21:03.730
Did you say
he's not Jewish?

21:03.763 --> 21:06.433
Funny story, Rabbi.

21:06.466 --> 21:10.069
* My goyim parents
told a little fib... *

21:10.102 --> 21:11.471
Bup-bup-bup-bup-
bup-bup-bup-bup.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.473
You've wasted
enough of my time.

21:13.506 --> 21:15.475
Shalom, sir.
But, Rabbi...

21:15.508 --> 21:17.377
I said shalom.

21:20.980 --> 21:24.384
Okay, the Jewish thing's
officially over.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.619
Everybody back to our house
for some honey-glazed ham.

21:26.653 --> 21:30.323
* You're gonna
rock the Torah *

21:30.357 --> 21:33.826
* I'm gonna rock the Torah!
