<i>I think one of the most
emotional moments of my life</i>

00:11.899 --> 00:14.931
<i>was the night that
I was initiated into the Klan.</i>

00:14.933 --> 00:17.498
<i>I was led into the Klavern
hall, which was dark.</i>

00:17.500 --> 00:19.764
<i>The only light that I could
see was a fiery cross.</i>

00:19.766 --> 00:21.767
<i>And that...
put me through the ceremony.</i>

00:22.267 --> 00:23.932
<i>Purified me with water.</i>

00:23.934 --> 00:25.666
<i>Laid his hand
on my shoulder, says,</i>

00:25.668 --> 00:27.298
<i>"You're part of
the Invisible Empire,</i>

00:27.300 --> 00:29.400
<i>United Klans of America."</i>

00:29.767 --> 00:32.898
<i>And there was a tremendous
applause throughout the auditorium.</i>

00:32.900 --> 00:35.599
<i>And I came up off the floor
really in tears.</i>

00:35.601 --> 00:38.064
<i>Because that's what I'd been
looking for all my life.</i>

00:38.066 --> 00:41.699
<i>An opportunity to be heard,
an opportunity to be something.</i>

00:41.701 --> 00:44.065
<i>I first told him,
"Hell no!"</i>

00:44.067 --> 00:47.399
<i>I would never, ever.
But kill him, that's all I want.</i>

00:47.401 --> 00:49.134
<i>That was on my heart
to kill him.</i>

00:49.767 --> 00:52.332
<i>This is the kind of reputation
that I have in Durham.</i>

00:52.334 --> 00:54.766
<i>I'm not bragging about it,
but it is the truth.</i>

00:54.768 --> 00:57.901
<i>You can call Durham,
and they will tell you.</i>

00:58.368 --> 01:02.833
<i>Uh, no, I will not take no for an answer.
I have to have the word "yes."</i>

01:02.835 --> 01:06.433
<i>Because all of our blood,
when it comes out, is the same color.</i>

01:06.435 --> 01:09.734
<i>I haven't seen any blood different
yet than the color of mine.</i>

01:09.736 --> 01:13.066
<i>And I'm sayin' whatever you believe in...
I keep sayin' it...</i>

01:13.068 --> 01:16.102
<i>stand on it, baby, stand on it.</i>

Equal housing now!
Equal housing now!

01:42.869 --> 01:44.735
Equal housing now!

01:44.737 --> 01:47.436
They call this Magic
City, Mr. Atkins.

01:48.203 --> 01:49.969
Ain't no magic here.

01:50.870 --> 01:54.901
Abe Greenfeld ain't nothin'
but a vile slumlord.

01:54.903 --> 01:56.368
You know it, and I know it.

01:56.370 --> 01:58.868
And the black people
of East Durham

01:58.870 --> 02:01.136
have the same rights
as anybody else.

02:02.169 --> 02:04.768
This girl, Mr. Atkins,

02:04.770 --> 02:10.036
this young lady is a single
mother of three children.

02:10.738 --> 02:14.604
And she wake up this morning
to an eviction notice.

02:15.037 --> 02:19.202
But there's no hot water. What, baby,
for two weeks? That's right, Miss A.

02:19.204 --> 02:22.235
Two weeks, and you say, what?
No toilet? No toilet.

02:22.237 --> 02:25.639
No toilet. And that ain't
no way for no human to live.

02:33.804 --> 02:37.204
Mr. Atkins,
we done writin' letters here.

02:37.705 --> 02:39.771
We want to be heard before
tomorrow night's ruling.

02:40.238 --> 02:43.203
Miss Atwater,
you know our agenda is tight,

02:43.205 --> 02:47.270
and we simply cannot allot time
to everybody that wants to speak.

02:47.272 --> 02:50.670
- -Now thank you.
Show yourselves out.

02:50.672 --> 02:54.236
Mr. Tucker, to what
do I owe this pleasure?

02:54.238 --> 02:56.405
Sit down.

02:56.904 --> 03:00.005
And a mighty fine afternoon
to you, too.

03:00.606 --> 03:03.770
Now you listen to me, Councilman!
And you too, Mr. Tucker!

03:03.772 --> 03:07.069
We ain't goin' nowhere until
we get down to the brass tacks.

03:07.071 --> 03:09.138
You understand me?
Everything all right here, Bill?

03:10.938 --> 03:15.104
Mr. Oldham, now we have been
sitting here for over half an hour.

03:15.106 --> 03:17.306
- The councilman ain't done nothin' but...
- Ann.

03:17.904 --> 03:21.640
Ann. We're gonna give you your
chance to speak tomorrow night.

03:23.773 --> 03:24.905
Are we good now?

03:26.773 --> 03:28.406
Not yet.

03:30.540 --> 03:31.607
Come on.

03:44.039 --> 03:46.538
Samuel Grace. Ayes?

03:46.540 --> 03:48.674
Aye.
Nays?

03:50.040 --> 03:53.838
Okay, then. Fred Eggert,
Gene Waddle, and Samuel Grace

03:53.840 --> 03:56.038
are tentatively approved
as new citizens

03:56.040 --> 03:58.171
of North Carolina Unit Nine
of the Invisible Empire,

03:58.173 --> 03:59.575
United Klans of America.

04:29.933 --> 04:32.463
Kligraph is directed
to certify the petitions

04:32.465 --> 04:35.096
and prepare the oaths
for ceremony.

04:35.098 --> 04:36.499
Roy, next week should be fine.

04:37.766 --> 04:40.564
Final item.
Combat and firearms training

04:40.566 --> 04:42.533
resumes this Saturday
from noon to 4:00

04:43.198 --> 04:46.500
under the supervision of
second officer Floyd Kelly.

04:47.165 --> 04:50.664
And I'll remind the Youth Corps members
that this training is mandatory.

04:50.666 --> 04:53.164
Y'all hear me?
I'm talkin' to you.

04:53.166 --> 04:55.366
Yeah.

04:56.132 --> 04:57.333
Let's bow our heads.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.598
Heavenly Father, give us strong
minds, great hearts,

05:03.600 --> 05:05.533
true faith, and ready hands.

05:05.968 --> 05:08.599
Keep us unfettered
from the world

05:08.601 --> 05:10.030
that we might fight
the good fight

05:10.032 --> 05:12.097
and be worthy
to claim the prize.

05:12.099 --> 05:16.567
May we as brethren and Klansmen
be steadfast and unremovable.

05:16.999 --> 05:18.732
As we go hence
from this Klavern

05:18.734 --> 05:21.066
into the struggle
of the alien world,

05:21.701 --> 05:26.467
let us not forget the crowning
glory of a Klansman is to serve.

05:27.100 --> 05:29.432
<i>Non silba, sed anthar.</i>

05:29.434 --> 05:32.300
Not for self, but for others!

05:33.144 --> 05:34.840
Get him ready.
Mm-hmm.

05:34.842 --> 05:36.807
You can say that again.
He was born ready.

05:36.809 --> 05:37.843
Ready or not.

05:38.910 --> 05:39.977
Mr. Ellis?

05:40.475 --> 05:42.340
Oh, hey.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.875
This is, uh, this is the new
boy I was telling you about.

05:44.877 --> 05:47.008
Oh, sure. Sure, sure.

05:47.010 --> 05:48.808
Sure, Ben.
Come on in the office.

05:48.810 --> 05:50.144
I'll see you fellas.

05:52.777 --> 05:54.043
Have a seat.

05:58.910 --> 06:00.441
What's your name, son?

06:00.443 --> 06:02.244
Leonard, sir.

06:04.145 --> 06:05.710
Don't be nervous, Leonard.

06:06.676 --> 06:09.178
Ben here tells me you'd like to
be a part of the Youth Corps.

06:10.044 --> 06:11.178
Yes. Yes, sir.

06:12.744 --> 06:14.878
Why do you want to be in
the Youth Corps, Leonard?

06:15.577 --> 06:17.244
To help...

06:17.744 --> 06:20.642
To help protect
the white race of America

06:20.644 --> 06:24.778
from the communist niggers
and Jews who threaten us, sir.

06:25.577 --> 06:27.245
That's a good boy.

06:28.310 --> 06:30.709
But that's not all.

06:30.711 --> 06:33.243
It's <i>our</i> rights,
<i>our</i> freedoms,

06:33.245 --> 06:35.277
<i>our</i> way of life
that need protecting.

06:36.045 --> 06:38.342
We're an endangered species,
Leonard.

06:38.344 --> 06:39.344
You understand?

06:39.979 --> 06:40.979
I do.

06:42.979 --> 06:44.146
Let me show you something.

06:44.712 --> 06:45.912
You see that?

06:46.945 --> 06:49.176
One day, this will be
your most prized possession.

06:49.178 --> 06:51.578
It will give you everything
you need in your life.

06:52.045 --> 06:56.211
Brotherhood, standing in the
community, and a sense of pride

06:56.779 --> 06:59.079
that you're part of something
bigger than yourself.

07:00.079 --> 07:04.246
But most importantly,
it will be a reminder every day

07:04.912 --> 07:07.578
that you will no longer be
an outsider.

07:13.179 --> 07:15.080
Welcome to the Youth Corps,
Leonard.

07:18.212 --> 07:19.813
We gonna
take care of that thing?

07:20.113 --> 07:21.212
Yeah.

07:21.746 --> 07:24.146
Ben, bring the car around,
out back.

07:52.247 --> 07:53.279
Now what?

07:58.747 --> 07:59.814
We wait.

08:52.115 --> 08:53.949
She got a nigger boyfriend.

08:54.516 --> 08:56.616
The neighbors have
been complaining.

09:02.216 --> 09:03.250
Stay here.

09:28.583 --> 09:30.416
Wait for the light, Wiley.

10:28.485 --> 10:31.118
Hey. Thank you. Mm-hmm.

10:31.652 --> 10:32.919
Miss Dupree.

10:34.086 --> 10:37.852
Miss Dupree... Yes, I know,
Miss Dupree, but...

10:39.418 --> 10:40.519
Hold on, Miss Dupree.

10:41.219 --> 10:43.217
Miss Dupree says
she can't make it. Her kids...

10:43.219 --> 10:44.485
Oh, no. Come here.

10:45.119 --> 10:48.350
Cissy, you better get your ass
down to City Hall tonight.

10:48.352 --> 10:50.119
No, no,
I don't want to hear that.

10:50.352 --> 10:53.117
I have been a single mother
ever since I was 16,

10:53.119 --> 10:55.151
and that's a whole hell
of a lot longer than you.

10:55.153 --> 10:57.851
- -Well, child,
it's supposed to be hard.

10:57.853 --> 10:59.950
Are you gonna be there
later tonight or what?

10:59.952 --> 11:03.218
I better see your face
lookin' black and angry.

11:03.220 --> 11:04.384
Mm-hmm.

11:04.386 --> 11:05.620
Who's next?

11:20.887 --> 11:22.987
Hey, Jeb, I'll take this one.

11:23.554 --> 11:24.987
Sure, Mr. Ellis.

11:25.454 --> 11:27.887
Finish up that tire for me, will you?
All right.

11:40.320 --> 11:41.420
Can you
fill the place tonight?

11:42.121 --> 11:44.253
You know I can, Carvie.
What's up?

11:44.255 --> 11:46.121
We're ruling
on Greenfeld tonight.

11:46.554 --> 11:49.119
Ann Atwater and all her
Operation Breakthrough niggers

11:49.121 --> 11:51.520
are gonna make a scene.
I just need numbers.

11:51.522 --> 11:54.455
Jesus. Greenfeld.
You gonna help that scum?

11:54.755 --> 11:56.822
You know, C.P....

11:57.588 --> 12:00.086
Reelection here.
He got deep pockets.

12:00.088 --> 12:02.256
I need to
at least appear supportive.

12:04.288 --> 12:06.488
And you need to keep your
friends on the city council.

12:06.954 --> 12:11.321
I know, Carvie.
We'll be there.

12:52.190 --> 12:54.790
Oh, you late. Yeah.

12:56.257 --> 12:58.290
I guess that's
what they call Africa time.

12:59.890 --> 13:01.423
First item on the docket.

13:01.790 --> 13:04.222
In the matter of the
Edgemont community housing,

13:04.224 --> 13:06.921
the council will first hear
from Mr. Paulsen,

13:06.923 --> 13:08.991
representing Mr. Greenfeld.

13:12.991 --> 13:13.991
Good evening.

13:14.924 --> 13:18.089
As you know,
Mr. Greenfeld prides himself

13:18.091 --> 13:21.455
on providing comfortable
housing at affordable rent

13:21.457 --> 13:23.791
to a great many people
in Durham.

13:25.558 --> 13:27.489
The council will hear
Mr. Paulsen.

13:27.491 --> 13:30.456
As with any dwelling,
from time to time,

13:30.458 --> 13:34.456
there undoubtedly will be some...
wear and tear.

13:34.458 --> 13:38.589
- -Mr. Greenfeld fully
intends to address any of these issues

13:38.591 --> 13:39.992
that these folks might have.

13:40.691 --> 13:43.823
However, with
the recent inclement weather,

13:43.825 --> 13:47.724
Mr. Greenfeld has had insufficient
time to get to everyone.

13:47.726 --> 13:49.291
That's a lie.

13:49.592 --> 13:51.557
We ask that
the council grant us

13:51.559 --> 13:55.092
the 90-day extension
for these minor repairs.

13:55.792 --> 13:56.792
Thank you.

13:57.425 --> 13:58.492
Miss Atwater?

14:16.260 --> 14:20.559
Uncomfortable housing
and unaffordable rent

14:21.126 --> 14:25.560
are about the only two things
Abe Greenfeld has ever given us.

14:27.460 --> 14:30.324
Now,
I have here with me

14:30.326 --> 14:35.726
79 written complaints from
the residents of Edgemont.

14:36.261 --> 14:39.261
Each and every last one of
them is a code violation.

14:42.927 --> 14:45.225
I brought 'em here with me
'cause, obviously,

14:45.227 --> 14:47.794
you ain't get 'em the first couple
times when they were sent here.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.492
Order!

14:53.494 --> 14:56.392
Now we are fed up
with this man

14:56.394 --> 14:59.960
and his eviction notices
and his rent hikes.

15:00.594 --> 15:04.594
He has absolutely no care for
his tenants' living conditions.

15:04.860 --> 15:08.361
We humans. Humans shouldn't
have to live like this.

15:13.427 --> 15:15.859
Thank you for your comments,
Miss Atwater.

15:15.861 --> 15:18.292
And I will personally

15:18.294 --> 15:20.526
pass those complaints
on to the housing commission

15:20.528 --> 15:23.095
for future review.

15:23.728 --> 15:27.059
At this time,
the council will grant

15:27.061 --> 15:29.095
the requested
90-day extension.

15:29.529 --> 15:32.761
Thank you all. This council will
now stand in recess till next week.

15:36.070 --> 15:37.136
Bye.

15:40.903 --> 15:42.338
Put down that
paper, Claiborne.

15:43.304 --> 15:45.836
Put it down.
All right. Okay, Mama.

15:47.670 --> 15:49.204
Daddy.
Huh?

15:49.603 --> 15:51.503
Hey, it's time
to visit with your children.

15:52.104 --> 15:54.971
Claiborne!
I'm visiting. I-I...

15:55.671 --> 15:56.837
I'm visiting.

15:58.804 --> 16:00.338
How's your marks, Tim?

16:01.770 --> 16:03.271
Tim, answer your father.

16:04.770 --> 16:06.471
I'm gettin' an "F" in math.

16:06.738 --> 16:08.171
That's 'cause you're stupid.
Hey!

16:10.138 --> 16:12.170
Well, I know it ain't for
a lack of trying, son.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.437
Maybe your teacher can give you
a little extra time after school.

16:14.439 --> 16:16.072
I don't think this teacher.

16:18.439 --> 16:19.770
Why not?

16:20.305 --> 16:22.439
She said I just ain't got
a head for numbers, Daddy.

16:22.871 --> 16:25.103
She said
that don't matter, though.

16:25.105 --> 16:27.605
Said I'll just work in the gas
station with you when I grow up.

16:33.105 --> 16:34.138
Yeah.

16:35.340 --> 16:37.440
Maybe this teacher
ain't so smart.

16:39.706 --> 16:42.603
I'm gonna stop in at Murdock this
morning before I go in. See your brother.

16:42.605 --> 16:44.803
- Give him a kiss for us, Daddy.
- You bet.

16:44.805 --> 16:46.340
I don't like that place.

16:46.605 --> 16:48.438
That's 'cause it's full of
weirdos and retards.

16:48.440 --> 16:49.771
Kenneth Wade!

16:50.273 --> 16:52.104
Don't be
calling your brother that.

16:52.106 --> 16:53.870
I wasn't talking about him.

16:53.872 --> 16:56.073
- He just ain't as lucky as you is all.
- That's right.

16:56.872 --> 16:57.872
I'm sorry.

16:58.273 --> 17:00.039
You be sorry
cleanin' that table.

17:00.772 --> 17:02.006
Yes, sir.

17:04.906 --> 17:06.705
I better go.
Give me some sugar, sugar.

17:07.006 --> 17:08.173
Bye, Daddy.

17:10.771 --> 17:12.939
Let's go, girls.
Move your backsides.

17:16.673 --> 17:17.771
Marilynn.

17:18.506 --> 17:21.972
Marilynn!
Girl, you forgot your lunch.

17:21.973 --> 17:25.473
You'd forget your head if it wasn't
attached to your shoulders. Go on now.

17:38.107 --> 17:40.740
Hey, come on.
Help me out here.

17:44.474 --> 17:45.507
Come on.

17:52.641 --> 17:54.673
No. You gotta
help me out here.

17:55.607 --> 17:56.642
Hey, buddy.

17:57.642 --> 17:58.674
Hey, buddy.

17:59.442 --> 18:00.508
It's Daddy.

18:01.674 --> 18:03.275
How you doing, pumpkin?

18:03.774 --> 18:05.006
You have breakfast yet?

18:05.008 --> 18:06.608
Pancakes this morning.

18:06.908 --> 18:09.343
Oh! Hey, buddy,
that's your favorite.

18:12.209 --> 18:13.309
Thank you.

18:17.409 --> 18:20.641
You got eggs
and maple syrup.

18:27.775 --> 18:29.742
Supposed to cut this up
ahead of time.

18:30.942 --> 18:32.775
He can't swallow all this.

18:34.909 --> 18:36.109
There you go.

18:36.742 --> 18:38.109
There you go.

18:42.076 --> 18:46.308
So you must multiply
the three on this side by two.

18:46.310 --> 18:49.606
But remember,
whatever you do to the bottom,

18:49.608 --> 18:51.310
you must do to the top,
right?

18:52.642 --> 18:54.308
Good.
So, I want you to go ahead,

18:54.310 --> 18:56.344
work out the equations
that I gave you.

18:58.243 --> 19:00.474
Let's do the next one,
let's see what you come up with.

19:00.476 --> 19:01.943
All right?

19:15.411 --> 19:16.576
Don't...

19:36.078 --> 19:37.144
Over here. Come on.

19:41.478 --> 19:42.944
Ann Atwater.

19:45.711 --> 19:46.744
Hey, baby.

19:49.179 --> 19:50.379
Mama!
Oh!

19:50.844 --> 19:52.344
Thank God.

19:52.346 --> 19:54.444
Are you okay?
I'm okay.

19:54.446 --> 19:56.945
Okay, baby. You go wait in the car.
I'll be right there.

19:58.112 --> 20:01.143
Is anybody hurt? Everyone's okay.
Just lots of smoke.

20:01.145 --> 20:02.576
How did it start?

20:02.578 --> 20:03.977
Most likely electrical,

20:03.979 --> 20:05.477
the way they keep
this place up.

20:05.479 --> 20:07.810
Or it could've been set
on purpose.

20:07.812 --> 20:10.179
No. Klan ain't that stupid.

20:10.645 --> 20:11.712
Why do you say that?

20:12.645 --> 20:14.678
When a black school burns,
then...

20:16.812 --> 20:17.845
Then what?

20:20.347 --> 20:22.946
Then the black kids
gotta find a new school.

20:32.246 --> 20:34.644
Turns out,
he left the thing in neutral.

20:34.646 --> 20:36.811
It rolls
right back into the ravine.

20:36.813 --> 20:38.978
They didn't find that truck
for two weeks.

20:38.980 --> 20:42.478
Oh, are you talking about how
small your pecker is again, Wiley?

20:42.480 --> 20:45.079
That ain't funny, Doreen.

20:45.081 --> 20:48.181
Yeah, it ain't that kind of funny.
That's for sure.

21:10.513 --> 21:12.349
You-You wait...

21:16.449 --> 21:18.082
The guy's got one arm.

21:19.048 --> 21:20.048
C.P.

21:21.082 --> 21:24.881
Garland... Garland Keith, my friend.
You're out late.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.413
You wanna have a seat?
No, thank you. Gentlemen.

21:28.415 --> 21:31.579
Well, something must be awfully
important for you to lower yourself

21:31.581 --> 21:33.779
to come to a dump like this, Garland.
Floyd, come on now.

21:33.781 --> 21:34.982
No, no. Mm-mmm.

21:35.648 --> 21:37.980
I like
the White Citizens' Council,

21:37.982 --> 21:41.414
with their parade floats and
their fancy country club meetings.

21:41.416 --> 21:45.247
I'm always honored to mop up after
'em, do the dirty work.

21:45.249 --> 21:47.479
You'll have to excuse Mr. Kelly.
It's been a long week.

21:47.481 --> 21:50.414
Sorry to say it's
about to get a bit longer.

21:50.416 --> 21:53.779
There was a fire out at
East End Elementary today.

21:53.781 --> 21:55.514
So what? It's a black school.

21:56.681 --> 22:00.512
The parents have already filed
a petition to allow the students

22:00.514 --> 22:03.716
to finish out the year
at Durham Elementary School.

22:04.350 --> 22:07.183
There's an emergency
council meeting tomorrow.

22:09.682 --> 22:12.549
Well... Ann Atwater?

22:13.416 --> 22:14.615
I think so.

22:15.416 --> 22:17.914
This ain't no small
landlord dispute, Garland.

22:17.916 --> 22:19.682
We gonna need everybody
on this one.

22:20.816 --> 22:22.615
Well, that's why
I'm here, C.P.

22:29.984 --> 22:31.284
Were you scared?

22:33.550 --> 22:34.583
A little.

22:38.817 --> 22:40.516
It's gonna be
all right, okay?

22:41.917 --> 22:43.817
All right, baby?
You get some rest.

22:44.616 --> 22:46.318
Try to go to sleep, okay?

22:50.285 --> 22:51.483
You warm enough?

22:51.918 --> 22:53.151
Mm-hmm.

22:56.118 --> 22:57.384
Mama?
Mm-hmm?

22:59.285 --> 23:01.018
Where are we gonna
go to school now?

23:02.351 --> 23:04.151
Don't you worry
about a thing, okay?

23:05.551 --> 23:08.285
Mama gonna find you
somewhere real nice to go.

23:10.418 --> 23:11.684
Say your prayers.

23:14.851 --> 23:16.816
<i>The fire was strictly limited</i>

23:16.818 --> 23:19.582
<i>to the building's facilities
and perhaps equipment.</i>

23:19.584 --> 23:22.383
<i>I know your first appearance
here, you can't make an opinion...</i>

23:22.385 --> 23:24.782
I'm not gonna have them kids
going to Tim's school.

23:24.784 --> 23:25.819
Mmm.

23:26.785 --> 23:28.917
Well, they gonna
put 'em somewhere.

23:28.919 --> 23:30.986
Ain't gonna be
in Durham Elementary.

23:31.484 --> 23:34.152
Tim having enough trouble
without more distractions.

23:36.119 --> 23:39.186
May have to look into one of them
private schools outside of town.

23:39.819 --> 23:43.783
Oh, yeah. How we gonna pay for that?
I'm workin' on it.

23:43.785 --> 23:47.052
It ain't gonna work until you start
sellin' gas to the other half of Durham.

23:52.386 --> 23:53.585
What's that
supposed to mean?

23:54.253 --> 23:55.518
You know what it means.

23:56.087 --> 23:58.085
That's not fair.
Oh, fair.

23:58.087 --> 24:00.985
Hey. Come on.
It's not fair, it's a fact.

24:00.987 --> 24:02.584
It's not fair
'cause you know I can't.

24:02.586 --> 24:04.351
How's it gonna look
if the president of the Klan

24:04.353 --> 24:06.251
is puttin' gasoline
in a nigger's car?

24:06.253 --> 24:08.151
How's it gonna look to my Klan folk?
Oh. Oh, I see.

24:08.153 --> 24:11.617
I... I didn't know
that the Klan pays your bills.

24:11.619 --> 24:14.085
I didn't think so.
Here we go.

24:14.087 --> 24:16.119
You spend all that time
at Klavern hall

24:16.121 --> 24:19.651
jaw-jackin' about them niggers
and them commies and them Jews.

24:19.653 --> 24:21.920
- I don't sound like that.
- Yeah, you do.

24:24.988 --> 24:26.418
Give me some...
Eww!

24:26.420 --> 24:27.921
Claiborne Ellis,
you smell like beer.

24:48.520 --> 24:51.022
I'm not gonna have them kids
going to our school.

24:52.620 --> 24:56.120
This emergency council meeting
was called late last night

24:56.122 --> 24:58.585
after an apparent
electrical fire

24:58.587 --> 25:02.286
destroyed nearly half
of East End Elementary School.

25:02.288 --> 25:05.055
They've been in session
for nearly three hours now.

25:39.123 --> 25:42.288
This council is facing
some difficult decisions.

25:42.290 --> 25:47.122
Tonight, we've had to consider how
these decisions will affect the students

25:47.124 --> 25:49.457
of not one school, but two.

25:50.357 --> 25:52.854
We've heard testimony
from the marshal

25:52.856 --> 25:55.620
that eight classrooms
and three common areas,

25:55.622 --> 25:56.922
including the gymnasium,

25:56.924 --> 25:58.554
were unaffected by the fire.

25:58.556 --> 26:00.254
Unaffected?
Hey.

26:00.256 --> 26:02.455
Have you been to the school?
She's breakin' the rules.

26:02.457 --> 26:04.855
No, no. Ain't nobody talkin' to
you, C.P., so shut your mouth.

26:04.857 --> 26:07.254
- Miss Atwater, you've had your time.
- I've seen the school.

26:07.256 --> 26:09.588
And if that marshal says that
school is habitable for children...

26:09.590 --> 26:11.288
Miss Atwater,
you have had your time.

26:11.290 --> 26:13.755
...then he's just lyin'
or he just plain stupid!

26:13.757 --> 26:16.091
- Why don't you shut up?
- Don't make no sense.

26:23.257 --> 26:24.291
Shut up!

26:24.857 --> 26:26.458
We will have quiet
in the chamber!

26:28.557 --> 26:30.823
- -Now what
we talkin' about is important,

26:30.825 --> 26:33.624
and you're gonna damn well
listen to us, Mr. Steele.

26:34.191 --> 26:35.324
Miss Atwater.

26:36.025 --> 26:37.025
Miss Atwater.

26:37.858 --> 26:41.157
Kindly take your seat before
I have a deputy remove you.

26:55.993 --> 26:57.026
Now then...

26:58.325 --> 26:59.991
it is the opinion
of this council

26:59.993 --> 27:02.792
that there remain
two basic questions.

27:03.591 --> 27:09.024
One, is East End
a safe and habitable place

27:09.026 --> 27:11.559
for its students to finish
their school year?

27:12.326 --> 27:16.224
And two, would the students
of Durham Elementary

27:16.226 --> 27:21.293
be unfairly burdened by the sudden
and massive influx of new students?

27:24.259 --> 27:27.193
Our answer
to both of these questions...

27:28.559 --> 27:29.692
is yes.

27:34.060 --> 27:37.157
With the limited number of
classrooms that remain at East End,

27:37.159 --> 27:40.791
the students will be put
on a split-shift system.

27:40.793 --> 27:45.260
One from 7:00 a.m. to noon,
the other from noon to 5:00.

27:45.660 --> 27:47.325
We're good. I got it.

27:47.327 --> 27:48.461
Miss Atwater?

27:51.260 --> 27:52.758
Who the hell are you?

27:52.760 --> 27:55.028
Miss Atwater,
we're from the NAACP.

27:59.427 --> 28:01.826
<i>WDNC news time, 9:00 a.m.</i>

28:01.828 --> 28:06.125
<i>Recapping our top story, the NAACP's
legal action is causing quite a stir</i>

28:06.127 --> 28:07.826
<i>inside the county's
district court,</i>

28:07.828 --> 28:09.926
<i>one source saying
he would not want to be</i>

28:09.928 --> 28:12.158
<i>in Judge Les Hallford's shoes
this morning.</i>

28:12.160 --> 28:14.527
Good morning, Your Honor.

28:18.728 --> 28:21.759
- Is that it?
- Just arrived.

28:21.761 --> 28:25.295
Full and immediate integration
of all Durham public schools.

28:28.195 --> 28:30.159
Get Wilbur Hobby in here.

28:30.161 --> 28:31.261
Yes, sir.

28:33.561 --> 28:35.626
You've passed things down
before.

28:35.628 --> 28:37.462
Ah, you know
I can't do that.

28:38.028 --> 28:42.128
These idiots just sent kids back
into a school that's still smokin'.

28:42.495 --> 28:45.693
I pass it down, it's the same
as ruling against.

28:45.695 --> 28:48.662
I know. I just wanted to
make sure you knew that.

28:49.729 --> 28:53.827
I asked you here for your
counsel, Wilbur, not a lecture.

28:53.829 --> 28:55.029
Sorry.

28:57.996 --> 29:00.928
What if you held off,
delayed your ruling?

29:00.930 --> 29:04.728
Delaying the inevitable,
that's all that would be.

29:04.730 --> 29:09.527
No. You delay to allow the people of
Durham to reach their own decision.

29:09.529 --> 29:11.229
I'm not following, Wilbur.

29:14.696 --> 29:17.127
- I know a guy.
- You know a guy?

29:17.129 --> 29:18.894
Yes, I know a guy.

29:18.896 --> 29:22.328
He runs a department at
Shaw University down in Raleigh.

29:22.330 --> 29:25.627
He does this thing.
Uh, he holds charrettes.

29:25.629 --> 29:26.963
Cha-what?

29:27.629 --> 29:31.295
They're kind of, uh,
these official community summits

29:31.297 --> 29:33.462
with people from both sides
of the problem.

29:33.464 --> 29:36.997
They're called charrettes.
He's had some pretty good results.

29:40.163 --> 29:43.365
Wilbur, get this guy of yours
up here.

30:01.431 --> 30:03.798
Bill?
Wilbur Hobby's on the phone.

30:13.432 --> 30:14.665
Wilbur Hobby.

30:15.031 --> 30:17.162
<i>Why does
this phone call worry me?</i>

30:17.164 --> 30:19.029
Well, what a coincidence.

30:19.031 --> 30:20.698
I was hoping
it would worry you.

30:22.765 --> 30:24.263
How are you, Wilbur?

30:24.265 --> 30:26.263
Looks like you're havin'
some trouble up there.

30:26.265 --> 30:30.299
Well, nothing a heavy dose
of Bill Riddick can't solve.

30:32.631 --> 30:33.665
<i>Hello?</i>

30:35.399 --> 30:38.430
Look, Bill, I, uh...
I heard York went well.

30:38.432 --> 30:41.330
York, Pennsylvania, isn't
Durham, North Carolina, Wilbur.

30:41.332 --> 30:44.999
Well, all the more reason
we need you.

30:46.099 --> 30:48.099
<i>Look, you're the only one
that does this.</i>

30:48.866 --> 30:50.731
<i>Besides,
it'll get you outta the house.</i>

30:50.733 --> 30:52.333
<i>Delores even said
you're driving her crazy.</i>

30:54.133 --> 30:55.966
<i>We've been
drivin' each other crazy.</i>

30:59.467 --> 31:00.798
All right, Wilbur.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.367
<i>All right.</i>
Great.

31:02.933 --> 31:05.800
- I'll see you in a few hours, Bill.
- <i>A... A few hours?</i>

31:06.566 --> 31:08.033
Hello?

31:10.834 --> 31:12.931
<i>Now,
I've asked Bill Riddick here</i>

31:12.933 --> 31:15.301
<i>to conduct
a ten-day community charrette</i>

31:16.033 --> 31:19.498
<i>so that the citizens of Durham
can finally come to a resolution</i>

31:19.500 --> 31:21.631
<i>on the school integration
question.</i>

31:21.633 --> 31:24.598
The city council
will abide this resolution

31:24.600 --> 31:26.631
and enact
the will of the people.

31:26.633 --> 31:28.767
That gutless fool.

31:29.267 --> 31:30.301
Abide?

31:31.001 --> 31:33.165
Abide? It's not even defined.

31:33.167 --> 31:35.334
He's making us
define it.

31:36.267 --> 31:38.167
What are we gonna say
to the press?

31:39.234 --> 31:40.301
Nothing.

31:40.834 --> 31:42.967
At least not till
we get a legal opinion.

31:43.834 --> 31:47.701
And in the meantime,
what in good Christ is a charrette?

32:16.502 --> 32:18.968
Uh, yeah, we don't sell
gasoline to niggers here.

32:23.002 --> 32:26.103
I'm not looking for a fill-up.
Mr. Ellis?

32:28.669 --> 32:29.969
My name is Bill Riddick.

32:32.336 --> 32:33.336
Yeah?

32:34.169 --> 32:37.368
Uh...
Wilbur Hobby suggested I...

32:37.370 --> 32:40.802
- Wilbur Hobby sent you here?
- Yeah. He said I should come see you, yeah.

32:41.003 --> 32:43.670
He said you represent a great
many people in this town.

32:46.437 --> 32:48.136
He'd be right about that.

32:48.503 --> 32:52.268
Well, Mr. Ellis,
I've been asked to organize a charrette.

32:52.270 --> 32:53.834
I read the newspaper.

32:53.836 --> 32:56.037
Oh. So then you know...
Hold on.

32:57.004 --> 33:01.835
Are you here to ask me to come to
your, uh, integration meetings?

33:01.837 --> 33:05.803
Well, for now, just lunch.

33:06.536 --> 33:08.801
Lunch?
Tomorrow.

33:08.803 --> 33:10.704
With, uh...
with me and with Ann Atwater.

33:12.637 --> 33:13.803
Come again?

33:14.671 --> 33:16.502
Well, I was hoping you'd come to
lunch with me and Ann Atwater.

33:16.504 --> 33:18.504
- Ann Atwater?
- Ann Atwater.

33:23.171 --> 33:25.835
What did Wilbur Hobby think
I'd say to that?

33:25.837 --> 33:28.069
Well, he thought
you would say no.

33:28.071 --> 33:30.801
- He'd be right about that, too.
- Well, see here, Mr. Ellis...

33:30.803 --> 33:34.836
You're not from around here, Mr....
Riddick.

33:34.838 --> 33:36.436
...so I'll help you out.

33:36.438 --> 33:38.670
Folks in this town,
and especially me,

33:38.672 --> 33:40.672
want niggers to stay
in their own schools.

33:42.605 --> 33:44.838
That's definitely one of the
options, Mr. Ellis.

33:46.838 --> 33:49.473
But right now,
I'm gonna leave you my card.

33:52.638 --> 33:54.172
The local number is
on the back.

33:54.704 --> 33:57.605
You change your mind...
Boy, you better get on outta here.

33:59.172 --> 34:00.605
Go on, git.
Like I told you.

34:06.505 --> 34:09.206
Mr. Ellis,
I hope you reconsider.

34:10.139 --> 34:14.106
This charrette is happening. So, uh,
if you truly represent your people...

34:15.272 --> 34:16.340
represent them.

34:19.572 --> 34:20.739
Have a good day.

34:50.007 --> 34:52.339
We know this makes
you uncomfortable, C.P.

34:52.341 --> 34:54.670
But goddamn it, it's the best
thing that could have happened.

34:54.672 --> 34:57.605
"Uncomfortable" isn't exactly
the word I'd use for it, Carvie.

34:57.607 --> 34:59.605
C.P., what do you think
would happen

34:59.607 --> 35:01.972
if a lily-white liberal was
in there instead of you?

35:01.974 --> 35:03.341
Nothing good.

35:04.308 --> 35:06.839
A liberal and Ann Atwater
would pass integration

35:06.841 --> 35:09.139
faster than a hot knife
through butter.

35:09.141 --> 35:11.805
- That's what don't make no sense.
- What don't?

35:11.807 --> 35:14.106
This Riddick nigger wants
school integration, right?

35:14.108 --> 35:16.407
So why me?
Why put that on himself?

35:16.409 --> 35:18.274
I shoulda been
the last person on his list.

35:20.841 --> 35:23.008
C.P., this judge...

35:23.707 --> 35:25.309
Our hands may be tied.

35:26.142 --> 35:28.605
But it won't matter if we
have a friend on the inside.

35:28.607 --> 35:32.140
And especially if that friend
is C.P. Ellis.

35:32.142 --> 35:34.140
Oh, Charlie, I...

35:34.142 --> 35:37.309
He's about to hand you
the keys to school integration,

35:38.275 --> 35:40.009
and you're going to
lock the door.

35:51.775 --> 35:54.410
- Hey! How you doin'? How your dad doin'?
- Good.

35:57.276 --> 35:58.575
How late is he?

35:59.443 --> 36:00.542
Twenty minutes.

36:01.343 --> 36:04.976
C.P. comin' to have lunch
with two niggers.

36:05.343 --> 36:08.010
He'd just as soon shoot us
than do that.

36:08.809 --> 36:10.640
Y'all northern folks
just don't get it.

36:10.642 --> 36:12.241
I'm from North Carolina,
Ann.

36:12.243 --> 36:14.141
Oh, yeah? Where about?

36:14.143 --> 36:16.776
Hertford County.
That still north of here.

36:20.776 --> 36:21.809
He's here.

36:37.710 --> 36:38.844
Here he go.

36:54.944 --> 36:57.212
Would you look at
that crazy white man?

36:57.877 --> 36:59.910
Just pacing back and forth.

37:01.543 --> 37:03.445
I ain't waitin' for that cracker.
I'm hungry.

37:04.312 --> 37:06.845
Mr. Ellis?
Please, come sit down.

37:19.511 --> 37:21.143
Well, uh, okay.

37:21.145 --> 37:23.411
Um, thank you both
for coming.

37:23.413 --> 37:25.809
Hopefully,
this is a first step...

37:25.811 --> 37:29.144
Hey, I'm not gonna sit here one
minute longer than I have to, so...

37:29.146 --> 37:34.211
Well, go on and git, then. That way, me
and Bill can have a civilized conversation.

37:34.213 --> 37:36.509
Mr. Ellis, um,

37:36.511 --> 37:40.046
I'm holding a steering committee
meeting here on Saturday.

37:40.446 --> 37:44.344
And I've invited people who represent
all types of citizens in this community.

37:44.346 --> 37:46.478
All types?
Only two types in this town.

37:46.480 --> 37:49.810
Well, whites, black,
liberals, conservatives.

37:49.812 --> 37:51.677
For a charrette
to be successful,

37:51.679 --> 37:54.478
we need to bring together a
large number of diverse people.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.844
The only folk he gonna bring,

37:56.846 --> 37:58.610
they gonna be wearing
sheets and hoods.

37:58.612 --> 37:59.879
Ain't that right, C.P.?

38:01.612 --> 38:02.645
Hold on.

38:03.679 --> 38:05.045
If you already have
a meeting set,

38:05.047 --> 38:06.512
what the hell am I doing
sitting here?

38:06.880 --> 38:09.180
Well, you're here,
both of you...

38:10.147 --> 38:13.980
because I need two co-chairs
to lead the charrette.

38:23.180 --> 38:26.012
I'm gonna think about it,
you know,

38:26.014 --> 38:30.315
'cause I wouldn't want your type takin'
over this, uh... what'd you call it?

38:32.382 --> 38:34.382
Charade?

38:38.115 --> 38:40.015
I don't know
what you're up to either.

38:41.447 --> 38:45.445
I don't like it.
You could use me for my help. That's fine.

38:45.447 --> 38:48.113
But I am not gonna work
with that cracker.

38:48.115 --> 38:49.848
So you need to look
somewhere else.

38:51.681 --> 38:52.948
This corn bread is good.

38:57.914 --> 38:59.814
I would love it.

39:02.714 --> 39:04.446
Let me help you clear this.

39:04.448 --> 39:07.047
It was delicious.
Very nice of you. Thank you.

39:07.049 --> 39:08.847
You outdid yourself,
Mrs. Keith.

39:08.849 --> 39:10.880
Oh, well, thank you.

39:10.882 --> 39:13.713
Ten days is a long time
with them people, Garland.

39:13.715 --> 39:17.613
It's also a long time for them to
be making decisions on integration

39:17.615 --> 39:19.513
without us having a voice.

39:19.515 --> 39:22.116
That's not gonna make it
any easier to sell to my people.

39:23.016 --> 39:25.183
Well, you're their
president, C.P.

39:26.250 --> 39:27.715
You just make 'em understand.

39:29.483 --> 39:33.115
Hell, it says so right there
in your Klan Creed:

39:33.117 --> 39:38.183
"Failure to know your enemy gives
them aid and comfort" and all that.

39:39.850 --> 39:44.383
I mean, the truth is, C.P., we...
we don't know the enemy at all.

39:45.449 --> 39:46.516
Do we?

40:03.284 --> 40:05.547
You're yankin' on the trigger
too hard.

40:05.549 --> 40:08.715
Trick is to think of it as pressin'
the trigger, not pullin' on it.

40:08.717 --> 40:09.851
Ten-hut!

40:10.118 --> 40:11.615
Y'all heed this man, now.

40:11.617 --> 40:13.251
Mr. Kelly here's an expert.

40:13.717 --> 40:16.216
He even knows that word for when
you breathe out 'fore you shoot.

40:16.218 --> 40:17.417
What's that called again?

40:17.951 --> 40:20.182
Respiratory pause.

40:20.184 --> 40:22.449
See? What'd I tell ya?

40:22.451 --> 40:25.483
- All right, one more, then next up.
- All right.

40:25.485 --> 40:28.219
You didn't care too much for
that conversation last night.

40:29.018 --> 40:31.851
Well, when it's me and you,
it's fine.

40:32.817 --> 40:34.918
I ain't much for talking
in mixed company.

40:35.650 --> 40:37.383
Well, we do need
people there, Floyd.

40:37.385 --> 40:40.418
And Carvie asked me
personally, so...

40:41.185 --> 40:44.085
Yeah, I know it, C.P.
And I'll back you up on it.

40:44.818 --> 40:48.983
But, uh... be careful.
Careful of what?

40:48.985 --> 40:50.718
If you wrestle with a pig...

40:52.019 --> 40:53.285
...you gonna get muddy.

40:54.952 --> 40:57.850
Meeting these benchmarks
successfully will depend entirely

40:57.852 --> 41:01.984
on the dedication and enthusiasm
of this steering committee.

41:01.986 --> 41:04.984
And, uh, we haven't got
much time to get organized,

41:04.986 --> 41:08.053
so priority one
will be to get the word out

41:08.551 --> 41:13.919
and to recruit as many citizens as
possible to come and participate.

41:15.220 --> 41:18.586
All right,
before we go any further,

41:18.953 --> 41:20.986
we need to elect
our two co-chairs.

41:23.120 --> 41:26.187
I nominate Ann Atwater...

41:28.853 --> 41:30.519
and C.P. Ellis.

41:35.987 --> 41:38.019
But he's a Klansman.

41:38.021 --> 41:40.087
And we're talking
about integration.

41:40.519 --> 41:44.551
Uh, Mr. Riddick, I already done
told you I won't work with that man.

41:44.553 --> 41:46.485
That'd be just fine with me.

41:46.487 --> 41:48.952
Everybody know it would be
just fine with you, C.P.

41:48.954 --> 41:50.718
Just hold on a minute now,
Ann.

41:50.720 --> 41:53.021
I'd like to hear from C.P.
on this. Mr. Ellis.

41:55.254 --> 41:58.518
Well, I'm not in the habit of interviewing
for a job that I don't really want.

41:58.520 --> 42:00.752
But you're asking,
so I'll tell you.

42:00.754 --> 42:03.919
Everybody talkin' about nigras want
this, nigras need that.

42:03.921 --> 42:06.553
This whole thing started 'cause
of what nigras are demanding.

42:08.354 --> 42:12.020
What about white folks?
What about what we want?

42:12.022 --> 42:14.719
You already got everything you want.
No, we don't.

42:14.721 --> 42:18.022
Now the niggers in this town are trying
to take away everything we got left.

42:18.721 --> 42:21.254
They don't want us to play
"Dixie" at our schools.

42:21.855 --> 42:23.355
That's our song.

42:24.155 --> 42:27.286
They're angry when we fly the
Confederate flag at ball games.

42:27.288 --> 42:31.487
And why should one of our boys
have to play ball under that flag?

42:31.489 --> 42:33.586
That flag is
our proud Southern history.

42:33.588 --> 42:36.154
It might be your proud
Southern history, C.P.,

42:36.156 --> 42:37.987
but it sure as hell
ain't ours.

42:37.989 --> 42:38.989
All right.

42:39.789 --> 42:41.854
Integrated schools have
"blacks only" assemblies,

42:41.856 --> 42:44.387
"blacks only"
Martin Luther King this, that.

42:44.389 --> 42:45.653
That ain't my history.

42:45.655 --> 42:47.121
You wanna talk about schools?

42:47.123 --> 42:49.222
Let's talk about schools,
Mr. Riddick.

42:50.222 --> 42:52.156
My sons don't have it easy
in school.

42:52.989 --> 42:55.121
Their teachers ain't even
teachin' them half the time.

42:55.123 --> 42:57.155
And you want to throw them
together with a bunch of nigras?

42:57.522 --> 42:59.622
It's only gonna get worse
for them.

43:00.689 --> 43:03.323
You ask why?
I'm here to protect my boys.

43:04.423 --> 43:06.789
So all the better
if she don't get in my way.

43:12.356 --> 43:13.923
I'll sit with you,
Brother Ellis.

43:19.823 --> 43:23.355
Howard, have you lost
your everlasting mind,

43:23.357 --> 43:25.022
callin' that man
your brother?

43:25.024 --> 43:26.788
You're offering
to co-chair, Howard?

43:26.790 --> 43:28.422
Uh, I am.

43:28.424 --> 43:30.588
And that's an honest man
right there, Ann.

43:30.590 --> 43:33.224
The only honest man
that's stood up today.

43:33.991 --> 43:36.763
He hates me.
And he told me why.

43:36.765 --> 43:40.732
But then he opened up
his heart about his sons.

43:41.131 --> 43:43.364
Why is he agreeing with me?

43:43.366 --> 43:45.564
- I don't know.
- That means he's my brother.

43:45.566 --> 43:47.132
Did that nigger
just call me brother?

43:49.967 --> 43:51.232
Y'all hear that?

43:52.466 --> 43:55.067
I'll tell you what you are,
Howard.

43:55.866 --> 43:57.900
You one of them
"big niggers," ain't you?

43:58.733 --> 44:01.998
You done went up north
and got your college degree,

44:02.000 --> 44:05.467
your fancy cars,
and your fancy suits.

44:06.099 --> 44:08.365
Meanwhile, we down here on
the ground gettin' dirty.

44:08.367 --> 44:10.731
Now wait a minute, Ann.

44:10.733 --> 44:13.565
The Black Solidarity Committee has
been working within this community...

44:13.567 --> 44:15.933
Oh, shut up, Howard!
You're late to the fight!

44:17.334 --> 44:21.300
And you have no idea what
real black folk go through.

44:21.800 --> 44:25.267
You don't deserve a seat.
He don't deserve that chair, he don't.

44:25.801 --> 44:27.734
Callin' that man his brother.

44:30.567 --> 44:32.767
So are you saying you'll accept
now, Miss Atwater?

45:19.269 --> 45:22.367
I'm going to continue to fight
for us white working men

45:22.369 --> 45:25.436
even if I have to sit in a room with
that awful Ann Atwater to do it.

45:27.402 --> 45:29.500
C.P. Ellis don't scare me.

45:29.502 --> 45:32.500
We gonna beat school
segregation once and for all.

45:32.502 --> 45:34.934
Well, she's livin'
in her own fantasy world.

45:34.936 --> 45:37.235
Folks in this town
like things the way they are.

46:50.205 --> 46:51.736
Good morning, Mr. Ellis.

46:51.738 --> 46:53.937
Co-chair office is
just around the corner.

46:53.939 --> 46:55.073
Thank you.

47:17.505 --> 47:21.104
All I'm saying is
our children are way behind.

47:21.106 --> 47:22.804
Almost a full year.

47:22.806 --> 47:24.938
Well,
just havin' white teachers

47:24.940 --> 47:26.840
isn't gonna help them
catch up.

47:28.206 --> 47:29.738
White teachers?

47:29.740 --> 47:31.438
They already got
some white teachers.

47:31.440 --> 47:33.605
It ain't that.
It's about the books.

47:33.607 --> 47:36.271
Newer books don't account
for a whole year.

47:36.273 --> 47:38.540
Newer ain't got
nothing to do with it.

47:39.239 --> 47:42.005
Baby, what's your name?
In the red shirt. What's your name?

47:42.007 --> 47:43.540
- Miles.
- Miles.

47:44.274 --> 47:46.438
What year did you
just finish, Miles?

47:46.440 --> 47:48.072
My junior year.
Mm-hmm.

47:48.074 --> 47:50.174
And what year
were your books for?

47:51.540 --> 47:53.274
The textbooks were
for the tenth-graders, ma'am.

47:58.107 --> 47:59.739
Well, how's that gonna work?

47:59.741 --> 48:01.872
How's what gonna work, C.P.?

48:01.874 --> 48:04.774
You gonna put a bunch of black
kids who are a year behind...

48:05.641 --> 48:07.073
with white kids who aren't.

48:07.075 --> 48:08.939
How you gonna teach
that class?

48:08.941 --> 48:11.305
You can't.
It just ain't possible.

48:11.307 --> 48:14.172
So you go ahead
and get the right books,

48:14.174 --> 48:17.708
but you can't teach
that class, no way. No way.

48:47.067 --> 48:48.731
Okay. So tomorrow,

48:48.733 --> 48:50.831
we'll break into
our smaller groups

48:50.833 --> 48:53.065
and begin hammering out the
different resolution points.

48:53.067 --> 48:56.098
But we meet back here
each night for wrap-up.

48:56.100 --> 48:59.366
Also, you've noticed these, uh,
two tables up here on the stage.

48:59.368 --> 49:02.731
Along with Mr. Ellis
and Miss Atwater,

49:02.733 --> 49:06.068
ten more of you will be chosen to fill
these seats as part of our senate.

49:06.434 --> 49:08.832
That senate will vote
on the resolutions

49:08.834 --> 49:10.534
on the final night
of the charrette.

49:11.701 --> 49:13.899
Okay.
Unless there's anything else,

49:13.901 --> 49:15.568
I think we could all use
some sleep.

49:16.402 --> 49:17.566
Yes, Reverend?

49:17.568 --> 49:19.266
Mr. Riddick,

49:19.268 --> 49:21.135
it's been
quite a tense day.

49:21.868 --> 49:27.566
It may be wise if we have some
positive note to end each session.

49:27.568 --> 49:29.533
Something to lift our spirits.

49:29.535 --> 49:31.633
I think that's a good idea,
Reverend.

49:31.635 --> 49:32.935
What did you have in mind?

49:33.303 --> 49:35.732
Well, I notice
we have a piano over here.

49:35.734 --> 49:39.000
What if we all sing gospel
music at the end of each night?

49:39.002 --> 49:40.735
- Okay.
- Nigger music.

49:41.702 --> 49:44.000
What did you say?

49:44.002 --> 49:46.700
I believe he said
that's nigger music.

49:46.702 --> 49:49.667
Gospel music don't have nothing
to do with black or white.

49:49.669 --> 49:52.900
It's about God.
Praise God, but he... he's right.

49:52.902 --> 49:55.767
Gospel music is absolutely
for black folk.

49:55.769 --> 49:58.134
I'm a bit surprised that
the reverend would suggest

49:58.136 --> 49:59.268
something so one-sided.

49:59.270 --> 50:00.867
I'm a little disappointed.

50:00.869 --> 50:02.436
Okay.
I can appreciate that, C.P.

50:02.802 --> 50:04.900
These people would like
gospel music.

50:04.902 --> 50:07.337
So, uh, how would you like
to represent your people?

50:09.735 --> 50:13.270
Well, I'd like to display our Klan
materials here at the charrette.

50:17.404 --> 50:18.537
Klan materials?

50:19.203 --> 50:20.437
Mm-hmm.

50:22.836 --> 50:25.502
It's not the same thing.
I know that.

50:25.504 --> 50:27.801
We can't let him do it. That stuff's
full of hate. That's all it is.

50:27.803 --> 50:30.202
He gave on the gospel.
I don't give a damn what he gave on.

50:30.204 --> 50:32.269
Well, he gave, so we give.

50:32.271 --> 50:35.202
Bill Riddick, if that stuff shows up
here, it's gonna be a riot.

50:35.204 --> 50:37.768
And you can bet your ass I'm gonna
be the one leading the charge.

50:37.770 --> 50:40.171
Oh, you gonna get all
Roughhouse Annie on me now, huh?

50:40.670 --> 50:43.871
Yeah, I heard tell about you.
All talkin' and no listenin'.

50:44.537 --> 50:47.735
We're here trying to understand each
other for once and stop fighting.

50:47.737 --> 50:50.403
I'll stop fightin' when there
ain't nothing left to fight for.

50:50.405 --> 50:52.804
Then you gonna be goin' uphill
the rest of your life, Ann.

50:53.837 --> 50:56.602
In the meantime,
I'm-a keep that man here talkin'

50:56.604 --> 50:58.339
as long as I possibly can.

51:00.804 --> 51:02.771
C.P.

51:04.072 --> 51:05.105
C.P.

51:07.637 --> 51:10.203
This, um,
display you want to bring.

51:10.205 --> 51:12.170
We're willing to go along
with it.

51:12.172 --> 51:13.903
But there'll be folks not wild
about the sight of it.

51:13.905 --> 51:16.103
So, uh, you're gonna need
to provide some security,

51:16.105 --> 51:18.037
someone to watch over it.

51:18.039 --> 51:19.539
I'm not gonna be responsible for it.

51:22.407 --> 51:23.872
This is my security.

51:24.705 --> 51:26.307
That gun
don't belong here.

51:27.005 --> 51:30.772
I like to have it close in case I
need it to do my talkin' for me.

51:32.106 --> 51:34.240
This here does the talkin'
for me.

51:34.472 --> 51:38.071
I have a Bible. Oh, you do?
Have you read it?

51:38.073 --> 51:39.439
Course I've read it.

51:39.906 --> 51:42.271
- Even go to church on Sundays.
- Hmm.

51:42.273 --> 51:44.338
Well, then,
you ought to know, C.P.

51:44.340 --> 51:45.373
Know what?

51:46.273 --> 51:48.906
Same God made you, made me.

52:10.639 --> 52:12.072
That's everything,
Mr. Ellis.

52:12.074 --> 52:13.874
Looks good, Ben. Real good.

52:14.174 --> 52:15.774
Thank you, Mr. Ellis.

52:26.874 --> 52:29.074
Divided according to race.

52:30.275 --> 52:32.507
Uh, six black, six white.

52:32.874 --> 52:35.705
The senate members will float in
and out of different working groups,

52:35.707 --> 52:37.540
observing and participating.

52:38.108 --> 52:40.040
On the final night
of the charrette,

52:40.042 --> 52:42.206
you will vote
to either adopt or reject

52:42.208 --> 52:43.873
the resolutions
presented to you.

52:43.875 --> 52:45.607
So, we're the final word?

52:45.875 --> 52:47.439
Final word, Howard.

52:47.441 --> 52:49.741
Two-thirds majority
to pass each resolution.

52:51.508 --> 52:52.942
Eight votes to pass?

52:54.075 --> 52:56.839
Then we should be able to handpick
the other four white members.

52:56.841 --> 52:59.006
Well, then, we might as well
go on home then.

52:59.008 --> 53:00.639
C.P.,
that's not practical.

53:00.641 --> 53:02.075
We need to be
as fair as possible.

53:02.376 --> 53:04.973
I'm gonna have to side
with my friend here.

53:04.975 --> 53:07.408
I mean,
we can surely all agree

53:07.410 --> 53:09.374
that every Negro
in the building

53:09.376 --> 53:11.241
is gonna vote yes
on school integration.

53:11.243 --> 53:13.374
That's six automatic votes,
no matter what.

53:13.376 --> 53:15.374
Same's not true
for every last white person.

53:15.376 --> 53:17.541
There's a bunch of liberals
sittin' out there right now.

53:19.509 --> 53:23.409
Look, there are four prominent
organizations represented

53:23.411 --> 53:25.207
in this room, right here.

53:25.209 --> 53:27.674
The Klan,
The White Citizens' Council,

53:27.676 --> 53:30.076
Black Solidarity Committee,
and Operation Breakthrough.

53:30.842 --> 53:32.144
You each get your votes.

53:32.575 --> 53:33.742
You want fair?

53:34.110 --> 53:36.010
We'll pick
eight regular members.

53:36.410 --> 53:39.809
Regular. No black power people, no Klan.
They're excluded.

53:41.194 --> 53:42.227
Agreed?

53:46.527 --> 53:48.358
- None of her people?
- No.

53:48.360 --> 53:49.860
And none of y'all.

54:06.127 --> 54:07.160
Hey!

54:07.793 --> 54:10.027
What do you think
you doing, huh?

54:12.295 --> 54:14.159
Leave that alone.

54:14.161 --> 54:16.693
Boys need to be reading this
instead of ripping it up.

54:17.495 --> 54:22.161
The Klan is givin' you
a window to look through.

54:24.595 --> 54:26.626
You need to read this stuff
and understand it.

54:26.628 --> 54:28.094
That way,
you understand them.

54:28.428 --> 54:31.959
Okay? You got the upper hand.
Got it?

54:31.961 --> 54:34.329
Get on outta here, Charles.
Give me that.

54:35.128 --> 54:37.329
Should tell your daddy.
You know better.

54:45.529 --> 54:47.262
Kids don't make no sense...

55:18.463 --> 55:22.428
"...professional experts from in
the community and from outside

55:22.430 --> 55:25.197
will stand by
listening, learning."

55:52.264 --> 55:53.929
Ann? Ann?
What?

55:53.931 --> 55:55.964
Where are you going?
I'm going home.

55:56.764 --> 55:58.496
Look,
I know you're upset, Ann.

55:58.498 --> 56:00.029
You don't know nothing!

56:00.031 --> 56:01.629
I told you
it was a damn fool idea

56:01.631 --> 56:03.596
to let that man
bring that stuff in here.

56:03.598 --> 56:05.365
Ain't no good
gonna come from it!

56:05.764 --> 56:08.031
And I'll tell you
something else, Bill Riddick.

56:08.631 --> 56:10.062
You an even bigger fool

56:10.064 --> 56:11.695
if you think you gonna make
any change

56:11.697 --> 56:13.163
with this here meeting.

56:13.165 --> 56:14.499
Is that right?
That's right.

56:15.065 --> 56:17.529
'Cause as long as
the C.P. Ellises of the world

56:17.531 --> 56:18.863
keep gettin' their way,

56:18.865 --> 56:20.363
ain't nothing gonna change.

56:20.365 --> 56:22.665
Yeah, you talk about
Roughhouse Annie?

56:23.631 --> 56:26.463
Keep Uncle Tommin'
that cracker

56:26.465 --> 56:28.632
and you gonna see
Roughhouse Annie.

56:29.698 --> 56:32.698
Go on back up north where you belong,
'cause you don't know nothing.

57:05.999 --> 57:07.200
Marion Wilson.

57:14.899 --> 57:17.034
Okay. The other bowl now.

57:20.067 --> 57:21.100
<i>Sam Watford.</i>

57:22.800 --> 57:24.700
- Is that Scooter Watford's boy?
- Yeah.

57:26.201 --> 57:27.800
You won't have
a problem there.

57:28.533 --> 57:30.134
You sure?
Pretty sure.

57:30.501 --> 57:33.265
I remember he kept losin' jobs
during them boycotts.

57:33.267 --> 57:34.634
Still pretty sore about it.

57:35.668 --> 57:37.967
I don't like that mustache,
tell you what.

57:38.335 --> 57:40.268
All right. Earl Weeks.

57:42.335 --> 57:43.700
He's... He's with us.

57:43.967 --> 57:45.235
How do you know?

57:46.035 --> 57:48.168
He been a deacon at my church
since I was a kid.

57:48.668 --> 57:49.935
He don't like nobody.

57:51.402 --> 57:54.666
- That's a good man.
- Two for two.

57:54.668 --> 57:58.300
Okay, we gonna have an issue
with this gal Maddy Mays.

57:58.302 --> 57:59.966
The blonde over by the window.

57:59.968 --> 58:01.333
Yeah, she's a nurse.

58:01.335 --> 58:02.834
Yeah, over at Durham Clinic.

58:03.302 --> 58:05.868
Real "people person." I think
that's one to worry about.

58:07.602 --> 58:09.099
Last is Lee Trombley.

58:09.101 --> 58:11.500
Trombley Hardware.

58:11.502 --> 58:12.602
Off of Route Nine.

58:13.535 --> 58:15.400
What do we know?

58:15.402 --> 58:17.002
I don't know 'bout him, C.P.

58:17.969 --> 58:19.069
<i>Might be a problem there.</i>

58:20.002 --> 58:22.069
<i>He took over
after his daddy passed.</i>

58:22.969 --> 58:25.402
<i>Family man, two kids, I think.</i>

58:25.735 --> 58:27.002
<i>And?</i>

58:27.869 --> 58:30.100
<i>Everybody that
works for him is a nigger.</i>

58:30.102 --> 58:31.136
<i>Every one.</i>

58:31.636 --> 58:33.670
And they all thick as thieves.

58:37.936 --> 58:41.204
All right, I guess it's time we
get acquainted with Lee Trombley.

59:02.937 --> 59:04.037
Can I help you, sir?

59:05.103 --> 59:07.370
Uh... Lee around?

59:07.703 --> 59:10.368
No, sir. He's not here right now.
But I'm the manager.

59:10.370 --> 59:11.671
Something I can help you with?

59:14.305 --> 59:15.671
Uh, no. Um...

59:16.504 --> 59:18.104
I'll come back another time.

59:29.572 --> 59:30.638
Okay.

59:31.138 --> 59:33.837
Any thoughts, uh, insights?

59:34.804 --> 59:36.505
You don't have to
raise your hand, Maddy.

59:36.804 --> 59:39.205
I think it's nice to see
people talking for once.

59:39.638 --> 59:41.505
That ain't talkin'.
It's yellin'.

59:41.871 --> 59:43.769
Well, okay. It's arguing.

59:43.771 --> 59:47.070
But people are listening to one another.
They really are.

59:47.072 --> 59:50.835
They're arguing.
I've been listening to it for days,

59:50.837 --> 59:53.870
and still no one's answered how
integration's gonna help my kids.

59:53.872 --> 59:57.037
- It sure can't hurt 'em.
- It sure as hell can.

59:57.039 --> 01:00:00.037
- I'd like to know how.
- Well, for one,

01:00:00.039 --> 01:00:03.005
I don't want my daughter sitting
next to a Negro boy in class.

01:00:03.438 --> 01:00:05.170
I don't want her
eatin' next to one,

01:00:05.172 --> 01:00:07.337
and don't want her being
at a school dance with one.

01:00:07.339 --> 01:00:09.673
So, you care
about your daughter?

01:00:10.805 --> 01:00:12.703
And you don't want
to see her get hurt.

01:00:12.705 --> 01:00:14.370
What's your point?

01:00:14.372 --> 01:00:18.339
My point is that is
what we do as parents.

01:00:19.339 --> 01:00:23.238
When they're little, we try to
keep them from touching the stove

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.439
so they don't burn.

01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:28.606
We teach them to take small
bites so they don't choke.

01:00:29.406 --> 01:00:32.038
We worry about
their first day at school,

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.538
the first time
they drive a car,

01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:35.304
their very first job.

01:00:35.306 --> 01:00:40.104
See, we want them to avoid
the pain that we experienced.

01:00:40.106 --> 01:00:42.073
All right. All right.

01:00:42.373 --> 01:00:44.971
We all gonna sit around,
hold hands, sing "Kumbaya"?

01:00:44.973 --> 01:00:47.871
- We see what you're doing, Howard.
- And what is that, C.P.?

01:00:47.873 --> 01:00:50.206
That there's no difference
between blacks and whites, right?

01:00:50.208 --> 01:00:52.838
'Cause we all worry
about our kids.

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:54.672
We're all the same, right?

01:00:54.674 --> 01:00:59.572
Actually, no, C.P. We're not.

01:00:59.574 --> 01:01:01.440
See, I left some things out.

01:01:02.174 --> 01:01:04.705
I left out
that black folks have

01:01:04.707 --> 01:01:07.707
a whole different menu of pain
to worry about.

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:11.675
Our kids get spit on
for no reason.

01:01:12.508 --> 01:01:17.374
Our kids have to move on the
sidewalk to let white folks pass,

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:19.341
or they get beat.

01:01:20.408 --> 01:01:22.774
Our kids aren't allowed
to sit where they want,

01:01:23.208 --> 01:01:26.675
play where they want,
go to school where they want.

01:01:27.808 --> 01:01:32.173
See, this is the pain
they experience every day

01:01:32.175 --> 01:01:35.741
that we, we can't...
can't spare them from.

01:01:37.442 --> 01:01:40.142
And that is a...

01:01:42.375 --> 01:01:43.875
It's a helpless feeling.

01:01:45.475 --> 01:01:48.509
A more helpless feeling
than you could ever know.

01:01:57.976 --> 01:02:00.307
I fell right into that one.
Yeah.

01:02:00.309 --> 01:02:02.909
Shit. You see Trombley's face?
Yeah.

01:02:03.643 --> 01:02:06.840
Did you get anywhere with Trombley
last night? He wasn't there.

01:02:06.842 --> 01:02:09.175
They were right, though.
He got a black manager.

01:02:09.842 --> 01:02:11.709
Well, where we gonna
get him, then?

01:02:12.143 --> 01:02:14.274
Right now.
We gonna crowd him at lunch.

01:02:14.276 --> 01:02:15.707
Mmm.

01:02:15.709 --> 01:02:17.677
Okay.
Everybody listen up.

01:02:18.842 --> 01:02:20.709
We're going to be trying
something different today.

01:02:21.110 --> 01:02:24.077
There are name cards at
each seat in this lunchroom.

01:02:24.476 --> 01:02:27.141
This will be your seat
for the rest of the charrette.

01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:29.210
You may not move
your name card.

01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:32.708
And you guessed it,
the person sitting next to you

01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:34.408
will not be
the same color as you.

01:02:34.410 --> 01:02:36.141
- What?
- And...

01:02:36.143 --> 01:02:39.975
And no discussion of issues
during this hour.

01:02:39.977 --> 01:02:41.210
Talk about something else.

01:04:07.547 --> 01:04:09.077
I just can't do it. Mm-mm.

01:04:09.079 --> 01:04:11.647
Mm-mm! Mm-mm-mm.

01:04:12.846 --> 01:04:14.913
These fish sticks is dry.

01:04:21.447 --> 01:04:22.914
Well... Hmm.

01:04:23.647 --> 01:04:25.581
If we can't change
anything else,

01:04:25.981 --> 01:04:28.447
we can sure demand
better school lunches, huh?

01:04:29.013 --> 01:04:30.914
We're not supposed to
talk about issues.

01:04:32.881 --> 01:04:34.280
I guess you're right.

01:04:41.013 --> 01:04:42.047
Howard...

01:04:42.847 --> 01:04:44.847
Howard was wrong in there,
weren't he?

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:47.381
Wrong?
Mm-hmm.

01:04:49.048 --> 01:04:53.712
Well, I mean, he weren't wrong
about what black kids go through.

01:04:53.714 --> 01:04:54.747
But...

01:04:56.215 --> 01:05:01.081
He was wrong about you not knowing
what helpless is, weren't he?

01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:05.748
What does that mean?

01:05:09.915 --> 01:05:12.248
You got a boy out at Murdock,
don't you, C.P.?

01:05:12.683 --> 01:05:14.681
- I don't wanna talk about that.
- I'm just trying...

01:05:14.683 --> 01:05:17.349
Ann, don't talk about my son.

01:05:18.981 --> 01:05:21.216
Don't ever talk about my son.
Okay.

01:05:48.317 --> 01:05:50.648
We're willing to go
to summer school,

01:05:50.650 --> 01:05:52.881
even nights, just to catch
up with the white students.

01:05:52.883 --> 01:05:56.016
Good Lord never intended for
blacks to have equal rights.

01:07:11.653 --> 01:07:14.418
Daddy! What's wrong?
What's wrong, sugar?

01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:15.453
It's Larry.

01:07:26.486 --> 01:07:29.284
What's goin' on?

01:07:29.286 --> 01:07:31.850
- Who is this?
- Alvin. He moved in Friday.

01:07:31.852 --> 01:07:34.520
Hey, hey.
Shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh.

01:07:36.819 --> 01:07:39.053
Hey, pumpkin.

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:42.051
- Go! It's okay.
- It's okay.

01:07:42.053 --> 01:07:44.419
No monster.
No monster, son. No monster.

01:07:44.421 --> 01:07:46.051
I got your book.
I'm gonna read...

01:07:46.053 --> 01:07:47.718
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh.

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:48.852
It's Vickie.

01:07:49.154 --> 01:07:50.850
Read to him.
Okay.

01:07:50.852 --> 01:07:53.285
Come here, pumpkin.
I'll be right back.

01:07:53.287 --> 01:07:55.987
- Vickie's gonna read to you.
- It's your sister, Vickie.

01:07:56.554 --> 01:07:57.753
Get him out.

01:08:01.454 --> 01:08:04.319
Hey, who's in charge here?
Can I help you, Mr. Ellis?

01:08:04.321 --> 01:08:06.485
No. Is there someone else
I can talk to?

01:08:06.487 --> 01:08:07.719
One moment.

01:08:07.721 --> 01:08:08.754
Hey.

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:14.219
Hey.

01:08:14.221 --> 01:08:15.520
I'll be right there.
I need help.

01:08:15.522 --> 01:08:17.152
No, sir. No, sir.
I need help.

01:08:17.154 --> 01:08:18.818
My son needs help.
Step outside that door.

01:08:18.819 --> 01:08:20.687
I need to get my son out of that room.
Yes, sir.

01:08:20.689 --> 01:08:22.818
Step outside for a moment.

01:08:22.819 --> 01:08:25.153
Now calm it down.
I need to get my son out of that room.

01:08:25.154 --> 01:08:27.319
Your son is gonna be just fine.
He's scared.

01:08:27.322 --> 01:08:28.821
He's not fine.
He needs to be moved.

01:08:29.055 --> 01:08:30.986
Right away.
Or that other one needs to be moved.

01:08:30.988 --> 01:08:33.286
My son's scared.
Look. Look.

01:08:33.287 --> 01:08:35.919
It's important that our patients
stay in familiar surroundings.

01:08:35.921 --> 01:08:38.819
'Cause if they're moved
too often, they get agitated...

01:08:38.821 --> 01:08:40.587
A private room then.

01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:42.354
Give Larry a private room,
please.

01:08:42.356 --> 01:08:43.919
We have regulations
here at Murdock.

01:08:43.921 --> 01:08:46.185
I don't care
about your regulations.

01:08:46.188 --> 01:08:49.421
Now you move him, or I will.
How's that? No, you will not.

01:08:49.423 --> 01:08:53.421
Mr. Ellis!
Call security right now.

01:08:53.423 --> 01:08:55.523
You calm yourself down.

01:08:59.754 --> 01:09:00.755
God...

01:09:01.555 --> 01:09:03.389
How much...
How much is it again?

01:09:03.755 --> 01:09:07.853
A private room is $75 more
per week.

01:09:07.854 --> 01:09:09.557
Now do you wanna pay for that?

01:09:10.854 --> 01:09:12.321
I got 16.

01:09:12.323 --> 01:09:14.390
Mr. Ellis.
Listen to me.

01:09:15.055 --> 01:09:18.156
Larry will get used to it,
all right?

01:09:22.956 --> 01:09:26.354
You shoulda told me. No one told
me that boy would be in this room.

01:09:26.357 --> 01:09:27.622
It was...
No one told me.

01:09:27.624 --> 01:09:29.154
It was a last minute...

01:09:29.157 --> 01:09:30.357
You shoulda told me.

01:10:10.058 --> 01:10:11.989
You know,
I'm tryin' to tell you now.

01:10:11.991 --> 01:10:14.524
His roommate was wailin'
and screamin' and...

01:10:14.526 --> 01:10:16.158
But they wouldn't
let me move him.

01:10:19.326 --> 01:10:20.757
I wanna take him home.

01:10:22.492 --> 01:10:24.059
He's better off with us.

01:10:26.559 --> 01:10:28.192
He don't belong there.

01:10:28.559 --> 01:10:30.025
He ain't like them others.

01:10:31.825 --> 01:10:33.992
<i>Yes, Claiborne, he is.</i>

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:40.292
<i>I'm seeing him tomorrow.
I'm sure he's fine.</i>

01:10:41.725 --> 01:10:42.890
<i>You okay?</i>

01:10:42.892 --> 01:10:44.393
Yeah, I'm just tired.

01:10:46.594 --> 01:10:48.527
I'll see you at home.
I love you.

01:13:55.773 --> 01:13:57.005
Can I help you?

01:13:57.606 --> 01:13:59.606
You can't,
but Bernadette can.

01:14:00.939 --> 01:14:02.606
One moment.
Thank you.

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:10.937
Miss Atwater!

01:14:10.939 --> 01:14:15.772
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
How have you been?

01:14:15.774 --> 01:14:18.738
Oh, baby, I've been good.
How about yourself?

01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:20.904
I'm fine. I'm just fine.

01:14:20.906 --> 01:14:22.674
Well,
what can I help you with?

01:14:24.774 --> 01:14:26.774
Where's that Larry Ellis boy?

01:14:37.807 --> 01:14:38.840
Bernadette.

01:14:39.507 --> 01:14:42.374
Yes, Miss Atwater?
I'm gonna need a favor.

01:14:43.807 --> 01:14:46.272
But that's not fair.
I know it's not fair, honey.

01:14:46.274 --> 01:14:48.373
But I went back and looked.
Not even half of them are done yet.

01:14:48.375 --> 01:14:50.005
But she never does
any of her charts.

01:14:50.007 --> 01:14:52.072
She always expects us
to do them for her.

01:14:52.074 --> 01:14:54.775
You and I have to go over all her
work, or it's gonna be on us.

01:15:04.075 --> 01:15:05.108
Hello?

01:15:06.941 --> 01:15:07.975
Hello?

01:15:08.375 --> 01:15:10.373
Where's Larry? Where's my son?

01:15:10.375 --> 01:15:11.575
He's not in his room.
What happened?

01:15:11.808 --> 01:15:13.676
Nothing happened, Miss Ellis.

01:15:14.108 --> 01:15:15.442
He was moved.

01:15:22.841 --> 01:15:24.008
It's so nice.

01:15:27.642 --> 01:15:28.676
Hey, baby.

01:15:29.343 --> 01:15:30.642
It's your mama.

01:15:32.475 --> 01:15:34.009
Hey, baby, it's your mama.

01:15:34.276 --> 01:15:35.809
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:15:37.143 --> 01:15:38.676
Let's put on some music.

01:15:51.876 --> 01:15:52.909
What?

01:15:54.809 --> 01:15:57.277
No, no, it's good. It's...

01:15:59.244 --> 01:16:00.576
It's just, uh...

01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:05.677
All right,
I'll see you at home.

01:16:18.477 --> 01:16:21.144
I want to talk to you.
Finally.

01:16:21.778 --> 01:16:23.177
Look. What you, uh...

01:16:24.810 --> 01:16:27.178
I didn't... I...

01:16:30.378 --> 01:16:32.276
I didn't ask for your help.

01:16:32.278 --> 01:16:34.475
I can take care of
my own family, okay?

01:16:34.477 --> 01:16:36.076
Okay.
Okay.

01:16:36.078 --> 01:16:37.976
Okay.
It's just what I do, C.P.

01:16:37.978 --> 01:16:41.076
Well, whatever is you do,
don't do it for me.

01:16:41.078 --> 01:16:42.444
I didn't do it for you.

01:16:54.712 --> 01:16:57.110
- Strike one!
- Yeah, Chester, bring the heat!

01:16:57.112 --> 01:16:59.246
All right, shut your hole.
That ain't helping.

01:17:01.978 --> 01:17:06.012
Don't pay him no mind, boy.
He ain't goin' nowhere with two outs.

01:17:07.079 --> 01:17:08.678
They'll hold 'em.
Be all right.

01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:23.414
I'll be right back.

01:17:31.746 --> 01:17:33.414
Your boy playing today?
Oh.

01:17:34.213 --> 01:17:35.280
Mr. Ellis.

01:17:36.013 --> 01:17:38.213
Uh, no. My nephew.

01:17:38.613 --> 01:17:40.444
You can call me C.P.
You want a beer?

01:17:40.446 --> 01:17:41.677
Oh. Thanks.

01:17:41.679 --> 01:17:42.946
Strike!

01:17:45.579 --> 01:17:47.814
So, how do you think
it's going? The charrette.

01:17:49.247 --> 01:17:50.580
Um...

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:52.280
It's interesting.

01:17:53.547 --> 01:17:55.414
It's nice to hear
both sides, you know.

01:17:55.714 --> 01:17:57.213
Yeah. Yeah.

01:17:59.013 --> 01:18:00.881
We got some decisions to make.

01:18:01.714 --> 01:18:03.181
Strike three! You're out!

01:18:05.913 --> 01:18:08.181
Say, that nigger fella?
The one that comes, uh...

01:18:10.714 --> 01:18:12.281
He runs your hardware store?

01:18:12.647 --> 01:18:14.848
Yeah. 'Bout two years now.

01:18:15.214 --> 01:18:16.314
His name's Emmett.

01:18:17.248 --> 01:18:20.047
And you trust him to...
to run things?

01:18:23.648 --> 01:18:25.746
Sorry, I-I'm just curious.

01:18:25.748 --> 01:18:29.615
I don't think I could trust one
of them to run my filling station.

01:18:30.415 --> 01:18:32.914
Other than my wife,
he's the only person I trust.

01:18:33.581 --> 01:18:34.713
How's that?

01:18:34.715 --> 01:18:36.748
Well, he and I, we...

01:18:39.015 --> 01:18:40.615
We were in Vietnam together.

01:18:42.415 --> 01:18:44.716
Oh. You were in Vietnam?
Yeah.

01:18:45.082 --> 01:18:47.548
Two tours. Got out in '68.

01:18:48.048 --> 01:18:49.115
You?

01:18:49.716 --> 01:18:51.315
No. No, I...

01:18:53.716 --> 01:18:54.816
No.

01:18:56.849 --> 01:18:57.915
Yeah.

01:18:58.883 --> 01:19:01.046
Well, look, Mr. Ellis,
I know who you are.

01:19:01.048 --> 01:19:02.547
And I know
what you want from me.

01:19:02.549 --> 01:19:04.480
But I just don't...
No, no, Lee.

01:19:04.482 --> 01:19:06.480
Any man who served bravely
in this country's military

01:19:06.482 --> 01:19:08.549
doesn't need to hear
anything more from me.

01:19:09.250 --> 01:19:10.783
You vote how you want to.

01:19:11.549 --> 01:19:12.616
I'll respect it.

01:19:16.183 --> 01:19:17.216
Mr. Ellis?

01:19:19.183 --> 01:19:20.850
Emmett served
this country, too.

01:19:22.483 --> 01:19:24.784
And he was a lot braver
than me.

01:19:40.050 --> 01:19:42.615
All right, folks.
For our last day,

01:19:42.617 --> 01:19:44.282
I thought we'd go
on a little field trip.

01:19:44.284 --> 01:19:46.849
Where to?
You gotta vote Monday night.

01:19:46.851 --> 01:19:49.215
I think it's important
we get a firsthand look

01:19:49.217 --> 01:19:51.050
at what we've been talkin'
about the past few weeks.

01:20:14.852 --> 01:20:17.384
I know it's been a long
day, but this is the last one.

01:20:18.685 --> 01:20:20.752
Please be careful.
Watch your step.

01:20:21.152 --> 01:20:24.652
Ain't no better over here.
It's a mess.

01:20:25.051 --> 01:20:27.550
They gotta keep the doors open
because of the smell.

01:20:27.552 --> 01:20:29.419
I imagine so.
It helps.

01:20:34.052 --> 01:20:35.884
Lot of kids
for summer school.

01:20:35.886 --> 01:20:38.252
Uh...
That ain't summer school, C.P.

01:20:39.019 --> 01:20:41.250
They still tryin' to finish up
from last year.

01:20:41.252 --> 01:20:44.084
Yes, because of the split
shifts after the fire,

01:20:44.086 --> 01:20:45.751
the students
were really only getting

01:20:45.753 --> 01:20:48.184
about three hours
of schooling per day.

01:20:48.186 --> 01:20:50.219
So, they're still catching up.

01:20:52.019 --> 01:20:54.418
Hey, how you doin'?
Did you get them shoes I sent you?

01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:55.885
Mama!

01:20:55.887 --> 01:20:58.119
Hey.
Oh, this your girl?

01:20:59.253 --> 01:21:00.486
Hey.
Hi.

01:21:01.353 --> 01:21:04.353
Marilynn,
this here is, uh, Mr. Ellis.

01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:07.187
Oh.

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:10.286
Well, I better get to class.

01:21:10.987 --> 01:21:12.120
Okay.

01:21:20.353 --> 01:21:22.788
She looked at me like I was
some kind of monster.

01:21:24.087 --> 01:21:25.353
What'd you expect?

01:21:27.821 --> 01:21:29.752
I don't know.
I'm trying to do right by us.

01:21:29.754 --> 01:21:31.252
Make it all better.

01:21:31.254 --> 01:21:33.287
And how's this gonna
make it all better?

01:21:33.888 --> 01:21:35.719
Hell, I'm...

01:21:35.721 --> 01:21:37.886
They wanted to integrate restaurants.
So we did.

01:21:37.888 --> 01:21:40.452
Then came buses and bathrooms
and playgrounds.

01:21:40.454 --> 01:21:42.218
Look, I'm over there right now

01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:44.119
supporting more funding
to make their schools better.

01:21:44.121 --> 01:21:46.218
If they have nicer schools, they'll...

01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:48.052
...stop pushin'
to integrate ours.

01:21:48.054 --> 01:21:49.954
The one thing we have left.

01:21:50.254 --> 01:21:52.254
Then maybe
we'll all stop fighting.

01:21:52.588 --> 01:21:53.921
Then what you gonna do?

01:21:55.921 --> 01:21:56.954
What?

01:21:58.187 --> 01:22:00.221
When everybody stops fighting,
who you gonna fight?

01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:14.090
Okay. Coming.

01:23:20.257 --> 01:23:21.656
Can I help you?

01:23:21.658 --> 01:23:23.525
Hi, Ann. Um...

01:23:24.424 --> 01:23:26.257
I'm Mary Ellis.
Claiborne's wife.

01:23:28.758 --> 01:23:29.924
Oh.

01:23:30.425 --> 01:23:33.090
I'm sorry
for just dropping by. I, um...

01:23:34.258 --> 01:23:37.957
I wanted to thank you for, um,
what you did

01:23:38.458 --> 01:23:40.158
for our family,
for our son Larry.

01:23:42.425 --> 01:23:43.558
Please, come in.

01:23:47.358 --> 01:23:48.625
Thanks.
Go on in.

01:23:52.793 --> 01:23:55.592
Hope you like sweet tea.
I do.

01:23:58.392 --> 01:24:01.225
So Larry is doing better, huh?

01:24:01.893 --> 01:24:03.057
He is.

01:24:03.692 --> 01:24:05.592
You know,
sometimes it's hard to...

01:24:07.125 --> 01:24:09.459
keep him calm.
Mm.

01:24:12.058 --> 01:24:15.592
Well, has, uh...
has Larry always been like that?

01:24:16.092 --> 01:24:17.259
Yeah.

01:24:18.426 --> 01:24:20.760
You know, when he was little,
it just...

01:24:21.526 --> 01:24:23.527
He started not to be able
to do things.

01:24:28.693 --> 01:24:30.991
Has C.P. always been
like that?

01:24:30.993 --> 01:24:32.858
Oh.

01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:33.894
Yes.

01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:36.693
More or less.

01:24:39.026 --> 01:24:42.591
You know, he used to be
a really good baseball player.

01:24:42.593 --> 01:24:44.024
Really?
Showed a lot of promise.

01:24:44.026 --> 01:24:45.291
Colleges came
and looked at him

01:24:45.293 --> 01:24:47.627
right over here
at Liberty Park.

01:24:48.761 --> 01:24:50.258
Where we met, actually.

01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:52.160
Came up to me,
he's so nervous.

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:55.326
Couldn't even talk.
So handsome.

01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:58.258
Oh.

01:24:58.260 --> 01:24:59.293
What?

01:24:59.927 --> 01:25:01.828
C.P. handsome?
Oh.

01:25:02.861 --> 01:25:03.960
He was.

01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:08.261
Okay.

01:25:09.861 --> 01:25:11.896
Mm-hmm.
Oh.

01:25:13.896 --> 01:25:14.928
Thank you again.

01:25:15.161 --> 01:25:16.194
You're welcome.

01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:24.727
Ann...
Yes?

01:25:24.729 --> 01:25:26.462
Claiborne is, uh...

01:25:29.595 --> 01:25:31.295
He's doing
the best he can.

01:25:34.395 --> 01:25:35.727
Bye.

01:25:35.729 --> 01:25:36.896
Good-bye, Miss Ellis.

01:25:58.396 --> 01:26:00.059
Gimme a minute with C.P.,
would you?

01:26:00.061 --> 01:26:01.296
Sure thing, Floyd.

01:26:19.864 --> 01:26:21.764
Hey. What do you say, Floyd?

01:26:24.363 --> 01:26:25.430
You got one of those?

01:26:33.664 --> 01:26:35.062
See the paper?

01:26:36.062 --> 01:26:39.097
Nothin' I could do about that.
All part of this charrette business.

01:26:44.097 --> 01:26:45.797
It don't look right.

01:26:45.799 --> 01:26:47.462
It don't matter
what it looks like, Floyd.

01:26:47.464 --> 01:26:48.763
Matters what it is.

01:26:48.765 --> 01:26:50.130
Oh, yeah.

01:26:50.732 --> 01:26:53.930
Your wife making friends
with Ann Atwater what it is?

01:26:55.364 --> 01:26:56.397
What?

01:26:57.963 --> 01:26:59.832
Couple of the boys
saw 'em today.

01:27:01.963 --> 01:27:03.565
How am I supposed to
explain that?

01:27:10.598 --> 01:27:12.430
She did something for Larry
is all.

01:27:12.432 --> 01:27:14.298
Mary was just
probably thanking her.

01:27:14.931 --> 01:27:17.029
Niggers is doing you
favors now, C.P.?

01:27:17.031 --> 01:27:18.698
Stop with the bullshit, Floyd.

01:27:19.098 --> 01:27:20.733
Mary's always gone
her own way.

01:27:21.398 --> 01:27:24.263
Has nothin' to do with how
I do my business. Never has.

01:27:24.265 --> 01:27:25.899
Now you got something to say?
Say it.

01:27:28.566 --> 01:27:30.131
Look around you, C.P.

01:27:30.533 --> 01:27:33.031
All these guys,
they look up to you.

01:27:33.599 --> 01:27:34.800
They need you.

01:27:36.064 --> 01:27:38.433
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm here, ain't I?

01:27:39.166 --> 01:27:42.199
- Are you?
- I'm doin' everything I can.

01:28:41.543 --> 01:28:44.042
Hey. Is Mr. Trombley in?

01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:46.376
Yes, sir. He's...
Can I help you?

01:28:47.076 --> 01:28:48.243
Mr. Trombley.

01:28:49.243 --> 01:28:52.209
We're from Durham Fire and
Life Safety Department. Uh...

01:28:52.843 --> 01:28:54.743
We've got a random
inspection order here.

01:28:55.209 --> 01:28:56.444
On a Sunday?

01:28:58.042 --> 01:28:59.544
We do 'em when they come in.

01:29:00.176 --> 01:29:02.375
We'll need access
to your breaker panels

01:29:02.377 --> 01:29:04.710
and your hazardous materials
storage area.

01:29:05.177 --> 01:29:08.544
Yeah, all right. Sure.
Uh, come on back. Right this way.

01:29:11.777 --> 01:29:14.008
So, Mr. Trombley, it, uh,

01:29:14.010 --> 01:29:15.675
seems your
circuit breaker panels

01:29:15.677 --> 01:29:17.575
are not up to code.

01:29:17.577 --> 01:29:20.342
You need at least 30-inch
clearance on both sides,

01:29:20.344 --> 01:29:22.110
and you've got
a little under two feet.

01:29:24.010 --> 01:29:29.041
Oh... They've been like
that for 20 years, since I was a kid.

01:29:29.043 --> 01:29:33.043
Nevertheless, that needs to be
rectified before you can, uh, reopen.

01:29:33.678 --> 01:29:38.111
Reopen? Yeah. Gotta shut you down...
indefinitely.

01:29:38.878 --> 01:29:42.976
What? Oh, no. I...
See, I can't shut down.

01:29:42.978 --> 01:29:45.011
I got...
I got a business here... Th...

01:29:48.044 --> 01:29:50.078
What are they supposed to do?

01:29:53.845 --> 01:29:57.479
I'm gonna need them boys
outta here... now.

01:30:00.879 --> 01:30:02.145
Like I said...

01:30:03.944 --> 01:30:06.111
if you fix things...

01:30:07.546 --> 01:30:09.579
you'll be open again
in no time.

01:30:11.379 --> 01:30:14.645
You have a nice day,
Mr. Trombley.

01:31:08.181 --> 01:31:09.980
My, my, my.

01:31:11.014 --> 01:31:12.881
Aren't you
a pretty little thing?

01:31:13.614 --> 01:31:14.781
Who are you?

01:31:15.614 --> 01:31:16.714
What do you want?

01:31:17.348 --> 01:31:19.981
Take it easy, Maddy.
We're just, uh,

01:31:20.848 --> 01:31:22.580
friends.

01:31:24.415 --> 01:31:25.581
Please don't.

01:31:26.248 --> 01:31:29.014
Shh. It's okay.

01:31:33.482 --> 01:31:35.715
None of these pictures
have niggers in 'em.

01:31:38.681 --> 01:31:41.449
We heard you might be
a friend of niggers.

01:31:41.748 --> 01:31:44.182
But I don't see none
on this wall.

01:31:46.849 --> 01:31:50.349
Just to be sure though,
we're gonna need to hear you say it.

01:31:51.883 --> 01:31:52.915
Say it?

01:31:55.249 --> 01:31:56.282
Yes.

01:31:57.282 --> 01:31:58.315
Say it.

01:31:59.082 --> 01:32:01.749
That you ain't
a friend of niggers.

01:32:03.582 --> 01:32:08.216
I'm... not
a friend of niggers.

01:32:12.616 --> 01:32:13.616
Again.

01:32:14.549 --> 01:32:17.716
I'm not a friend
of niggers.

01:32:25.550 --> 01:32:26.583
Well, then.

01:32:26.983 --> 01:32:29.083
We must've got
some bad information.

01:32:30.216 --> 01:32:32.949
Guess there was no need
for the visit after all.

01:32:38.384 --> 01:32:39.784
Thanks for the beer, Maddy.

01:32:55.718 --> 01:32:57.284
Hey.
Beer, C.P.?

01:32:58.251 --> 01:32:59.718
Yeah. Thanks, Doreen.

01:33:10.751 --> 01:33:11.950
C.P.!

01:33:12.452 --> 01:33:14.283
Hey, C.P.!

01:33:14.285 --> 01:33:15.716
What do you say, boys?

01:33:15.718 --> 01:33:18.051
Come on, sit down.

01:33:18.618 --> 01:33:21.283
Nah. Been a long week.

01:33:21.285 --> 01:33:23.350
Just gonna have one beer
and go.

01:33:23.352 --> 01:33:25.951
Oh, come on, C.P.
We celebratin'.

01:33:26.419 --> 01:33:29.383
Yeah. What are you
celebratin', Wiley?

01:33:29.385 --> 01:33:33.353
We celebrating
you gettin' your votes, C.P.

01:33:33.985 --> 01:33:37.219
Well, a little early for that,
don't you think?

01:33:37.585 --> 01:33:39.420
But have fun.

01:33:46.919 --> 01:33:48.685
What do you know about votes,
Wiley?

01:34:03.753 --> 01:34:06.084
You shut him down?

01:34:06.086 --> 01:34:07.785
What are you doin' here, C.P.?

01:34:07.787 --> 01:34:09.385
You shut him down.
What are you talking about?

01:34:09.387 --> 01:34:11.453
Lee Trombley.
Is that what this is about?

01:34:11.952 --> 01:34:15.285
You didn't have to do that, Carvie.
You didn't have to do that.

01:34:15.287 --> 01:34:18.118
This not a good time to show up, C.P.
I got donors in there.

01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:19.918
You haven't answered
my question.

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:22.087
We're just trying
to give you a leg up is all.

01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:25.918
Call it insurance, whatever you want.
You got a big vote tomorrow.

01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:28.118
That man served his country,
Carvie.

01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:30.419
Two tours in Vietnam.
He's a working man with a family.

01:34:30.421 --> 01:34:32.652
Well...
"Protect the white working man."

01:34:32.654 --> 01:34:34.485
Isn't that what you always said,
what we always talked about?

01:34:34.487 --> 01:34:39.654
C.P., sometimes there are
necessary evils.

01:34:40.221 --> 01:34:42.854
Necessary evils
for the greater good.

01:34:43.321 --> 01:34:45.253
And it's my job to make
those kind of decisions.

01:34:45.255 --> 01:34:47.021
You're just gonna
have to trust me on this.

01:34:51.487 --> 01:34:53.188
You should get
back to your party.

01:34:54.822 --> 01:34:57.088
C.P.? Are we good?

01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:21.322
Hey, Floyd called.
Said they want you at Klavern.

01:35:24.756 --> 01:35:25.890
Klavern?

01:35:28.623 --> 01:35:30.955
Something about a meeting
at 8:30 or something.

01:35:32.523 --> 01:35:33.689
What? You didn't know?

01:35:35.589 --> 01:35:37.523
Oh. You all right?

01:35:38.523 --> 01:35:39.623
You look tired.

01:35:44.056 --> 01:35:45.257
Yeah, I'm all right.

01:35:46.389 --> 01:35:48.556
You all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.

01:37:18.692 --> 01:37:20.926
He's here.

01:37:30.459 --> 01:37:31.593
Come on up, C.P.

01:37:43.827 --> 01:37:44.794
Hey.

01:37:45.393 --> 01:37:46.560
What's goin' on?

01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:50.460
Distinguished Klansmen,

01:37:50.861 --> 01:37:55.092
every now and again,
extraordinary things occur within our walls

01:37:55.094 --> 01:37:56.527
that need to be addressed.

01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:01.628
As your state leader,
it is my job to address them.

01:38:02.393 --> 01:38:04.559
In our fight
against communism,

01:38:04.561 --> 01:38:07.060
against integration,
against mongrelism...

01:38:08.361 --> 01:38:10.559
we turn to those among us

01:38:10.561 --> 01:38:15.294
who can lead us into
a pure, white future.

01:38:16.428 --> 01:38:19.795
We have one such man
here in North Carolina.

01:38:21.694 --> 01:38:24.628
Your Exhalted Cyclops,
C.P. Ellis.

01:38:32.928 --> 01:38:38.562
So, in recognition
of this man's tireless effort,

01:38:39.161 --> 01:38:40.827
for his forethought and vision

01:38:40.829 --> 01:38:43.629
in establishing the UKA's
first Youth Corps...

01:38:45.228 --> 01:38:46.896
I guess I'll just read this.

01:38:47.896 --> 01:38:51.062
It says,
"The United Klans of America

01:38:51.529 --> 01:38:54.728
hereby bestow upon
Mr. Claiborne Paul Ellis

01:38:54.730 --> 01:38:57.260
the honor of being named

01:38:57.262 --> 01:39:02.262
North Carolina's 'Exhalted'
Cyclops of the Year, 1971."

01:39:40.397 --> 01:39:43.762
What do you mean, you're not the right
person? Baby, the vote is tonight.

01:39:43.764 --> 01:39:46.662
Yeah, but there's gotta be somebody else.
There's nobody else, Maddy.

01:39:46.664 --> 01:39:48.362
You heard everything,
you've seen everything.

01:39:48.364 --> 01:39:49.829
No one else can take
your seat.

01:39:49.831 --> 01:39:51.297
What brought this on, Maddy?

01:39:52.899 --> 01:39:54.529
What happened?

01:39:54.531 --> 01:39:56.364
Nothing. I just...

01:39:59.564 --> 01:40:03.364
It's nothing. Um... It's fine.
If you'll just excuse me.

01:40:03.698 --> 01:40:05.264
Mm-hmm.

01:40:17.799 --> 01:40:19.965
Maddy Mays don't want to vote.

01:40:20.598 --> 01:40:22.800
Just like that, out of the blue.

01:40:25.031 --> 01:40:26.898
What'd you do to that girl?
Now, Ann.

01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:28.733
I saw the way she looked...
Don't you "Now, Ann" me.

01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:31.699
You coward.

01:40:32.298 --> 01:40:34.599
I ain't no coward.
Yeah, you a coward.

01:40:34.866 --> 01:40:38.029
Couldn't do it in here.
Too many people with they own thoughts.

01:40:38.031 --> 01:40:40.798
You couldn't win in here,
so you went and you fixed it out there.

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:42.633
I don't have to listen to this.
You gonna listen today.

01:40:44.064 --> 01:40:46.132
What you so afraid of, C.P.?

01:40:46.733 --> 01:40:48.930
I ain't afraid of nothing.
Yeah, you is. You're afraid.

01:40:48.932 --> 01:40:50.998
You afraid
you gonna lose control.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.931
You afraid you gonna lose
what you ain't even got, C.P.!

01:40:53.933 --> 01:40:56.097
You're poor.
Just like the rest of us.

01:40:56.099 --> 01:40:57.931
You ain't got nothing
'cept problems.

01:40:57.933 --> 01:40:59.832
Talkin' 'bout you...
you in control.

01:40:59.834 --> 01:41:02.065
You ain't no more in control
than the man in the moon.

01:41:03.032 --> 01:41:05.467
You're a bigger coward
than I thought you was.

01:41:30.568 --> 01:41:32.568
<i>The five o'clock news hour.</i>

01:41:32.902 --> 01:41:37.399
<i>With the highly anticipated charrette
vote just a few hours away now,</i>

01:41:37.401 --> 01:41:40.366
<i>we caught up
with WDNC's Ken Meadows,</i>

01:41:40.368 --> 01:41:42.533
<i>who was with some students</i>

01:41:42.535 --> 01:41:45.168
<i>gathered outside the
charrette site earlier today.</i>

01:41:45.568 --> 01:41:47.065
<i>Do you think
it's gonna be okay?</i>

01:41:47.067 --> 01:41:48.535
<i>Well, it might be all right.</i>

01:41:50.001 --> 01:41:51.833
<i>I think the same thing too.</i>

01:41:51.835 --> 01:41:53.766
- <i>Uh-uh. I don't.</i>
- <i>Why not?</i>

01:41:53.768 --> 01:41:57.767
<i>I don't. Because, see,
our first day that I went out there</i>

01:41:57.769 --> 01:41:59.601
<i>where we had to scramble,
you know.</i>

01:42:00.001 --> 01:42:01.401
<i>But it was okay.</i>

01:42:02.435 --> 01:42:05.567
<i>It doesn't matter what school
you go to, it's gonna be the same.</i>

01:42:05.569 --> 01:42:07.436
<i>You get your education
just the same.</i>

01:42:08.234 --> 01:42:11.702
<i>I'm fixin' to enroll now,
and it'll be my school.</i>

01:42:13.101 --> 01:42:15.667
<i>Are you concerned for
your daughter, or is she concerned?</i>

01:42:15.669 --> 01:42:17.267
<i>Well, I'm concerned for her,</i>

01:42:17.269 --> 01:42:19.769
<i>and I think she's concerned
for her education.</i>

01:42:20.702 --> 01:42:22.700
<i>Laverne,
I just talked to your mother.</i>

01:42:22.702 --> 01:42:24.700
<i>She said you're a little concerned.
Are you?</i>

01:42:24.702 --> 01:42:26.935
<i>I'm very much concerned.
Why?</i>

01:42:27.569 --> 01:42:31.267
<i>Oh, because I wanna...
I wanna be very sure about this year,</i>

01:42:31.269 --> 01:42:34.470
<i>and I want to really know
what they're doing, and...</i>

01:42:35.202 --> 01:42:39.802
<i>I think that it will work out if
everybody cooperates together.</i>

01:42:39.804 --> 01:42:43.570
<i>Because, I mean, this is not
the, probably, first time...</i>

01:44:17.906 --> 01:44:20.706
- You did great work, Ann.
- No.

01:44:21.173 --> 01:44:24.604
The one thing those people came here
for, we didn't get it for 'em.

01:44:24.606 --> 01:44:26.972
Not true.
Some of them will be delighted.

01:44:30.139 --> 01:44:32.939
You know, I never really
thought you was an Uncle Tom.

01:44:33.972 --> 01:44:35.173
Yes, you did.

01:44:39.374 --> 01:44:40.840
"Roughhouse Annie," huh?

01:44:41.273 --> 01:44:42.807
Don't you forget it.

01:44:51.773 --> 01:44:53.374
Welcome, welcome.

01:45:00.874 --> 01:45:04.107
Well, what a journey
it's been, folks.

01:45:04.742 --> 01:45:07.774
You've all shown such
dedication these past two weeks.

01:45:08.073 --> 01:45:11.575
And regardless of the outcome,
you should be proud.

01:45:18.774 --> 01:45:21.906
The resolution you've put
before this senate is clear,

01:45:21.908 --> 01:45:25.642
it is thoughtful,
and above all, it is brave.

01:45:26.542 --> 01:45:28.408
This resolution is
in three parts.

01:45:28.974 --> 01:45:30.873
After I read out each one,

01:45:30.875 --> 01:45:33.275
I will call the senate members
up to cast their votes.

01:45:34.041 --> 01:45:37.740
Each part requires
a two-thirds majority to pass.

01:45:37.742 --> 01:45:39.443
That's eight votes.

01:45:40.974 --> 01:45:42.108
Part one.

01:45:43.108 --> 01:45:45.574
Two students,
one black, one white,

01:45:45.576 --> 01:45:49.443
to be appointed every year
to the Durham school board.

01:45:49.742 --> 01:45:51.742
I vote yes.

01:45:55.242 --> 01:45:56.409
Mr. Watford.

01:45:58.176 --> 01:45:59.376
I'm a no.

01:46:01.543 --> 01:46:03.240
I vote yes.

01:46:03.242 --> 01:46:05.709
Part one passes
with eight votes.

01:46:08.743 --> 01:46:14.375
Part two. This calls that summer classes
be included in the school board budget

01:46:14.377 --> 01:46:17.442
so the black students become
level with their white peers.

01:46:17.444 --> 01:46:18.577
Mr. Weeks.

01:46:20.277 --> 01:46:22.575
I vote no.

01:46:22.577 --> 01:46:23.644
Mr. Cox.

01:46:24.676 --> 01:46:25.810
I vote yes.

01:46:28.210 --> 01:46:29.277
I vote yes.

01:46:32.877 --> 01:46:35.177
Part two passes
with eight votes.

01:46:46.976 --> 01:46:48.144
Part three.

01:46:52.378 --> 01:46:53.977
Public school integration.

01:46:55.545 --> 01:46:56.677
In summary,

01:46:57.578 --> 01:47:00.443
this calls for full
and immediate integration

01:47:00.445 --> 01:47:03.378
starting in the fall semester
of this school year.

01:47:04.244 --> 01:47:08.242
The resolution defines full
integration by setting a race ratio

01:47:08.244 --> 01:47:13.077
of no less than 25 percent
of any race at each school.

01:47:13.878 --> 01:47:17.343
And further, that busing be
made available to students

01:47:17.345 --> 01:47:20.645
to aid in the implementation
of this ratio.

01:47:23.045 --> 01:47:25.778
We'll start the vote
on this side with Miss Wilson.

01:47:35.446 --> 01:47:37.279
I vote yes.

01:47:42.813 --> 01:47:43.913
Mr. Watford?

01:47:50.447 --> 01:47:51.413
I vote no.

01:47:55.813 --> 01:47:57.480
Mr. Mose.

01:48:01.747 --> 01:48:03.246
I vote yes.

01:48:08.246 --> 01:48:09.413
Mr. Weeks.

01:48:13.914 --> 01:48:16.979
I vote "hell no."

01:48:23.347 --> 01:48:24.613
Mr. Cox?

01:48:29.514 --> 01:48:31.014
I vote "hell yes."

01:48:39.581 --> 01:48:40.748
Mr. Trombley.

01:48:51.980 --> 01:48:53.515
Thank you, Mr. Riddick.

01:49:00.782 --> 01:49:03.581
I believe in school
integration, and I vote yes.

01:49:08.682 --> 01:49:10.115
It's not gonna matter.

01:49:17.048 --> 01:49:18.148
Reverend.

01:49:21.082 --> 01:49:26.982
With the good Lord as my
guide, I proudly vote yes.

01:49:31.016 --> 01:49:32.149
Miss Mays.

01:49:50.616 --> 01:49:55.317
Although I think it should be
considered in the future, I...

01:49:58.583 --> 01:50:01.751
I don't believe right now
is the time for integration.

01:50:03.217 --> 01:50:05.150
Respectfully, I vote no.

01:50:06.918 --> 01:50:09.083
Hey.

01:50:38.819 --> 01:50:39.951
Mr. Clement.

01:50:45.118 --> 01:50:50.217
I am honored to have had the
chance to get to know most of you

01:50:50.219 --> 01:50:52.186
these past few weeks,

01:50:52.585 --> 01:50:55.518
to work on these vital issues.

01:50:55.952 --> 01:51:00.186
And while I fear
that my vote will be in vain,

01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:02.485
I'm still gonna vote.

01:51:03.319 --> 01:51:06.152
And I vote yes
on school integration.

01:51:11.786 --> 01:51:12.820
Mr. Keith.

01:51:19.287 --> 01:51:20.320
No.

01:51:29.786 --> 01:51:30.921
Miss Atwater.

01:51:59.321 --> 01:52:00.353
Yes.

01:52:07.822 --> 01:52:09.655
Looks like
we finally shut her up.

01:52:11.688 --> 01:52:12.954
Mr. Ellis.

01:52:13.788 --> 01:52:15.288
All right.

01:52:15.855 --> 01:52:17.087
All right.

01:52:20.388 --> 01:52:21.455
All right.

01:52:22.555 --> 01:52:23.588
Thank you.

01:52:24.222 --> 01:52:25.155
Thank you.

01:52:27.888 --> 01:52:29.321
I-I-I...

01:52:34.889 --> 01:52:38.488
Uh...

01:52:39.622 --> 01:52:41.921
I guess I'd first echo
what Mr. Clement said.

01:52:41.923 --> 01:52:43.823
It was good to get to know
some of you, and I...

01:52:44.955 --> 01:52:48.656
I know many of you will be
disappointed with our outcome here.

01:52:49.823 --> 01:52:50.856
I, uh...

01:53:05.289 --> 01:53:07.190
You know, before I go on...

01:53:08.590 --> 01:53:10.456
...I'd like to show you all
something.

01:53:13.089 --> 01:53:15.390
- This is my Klan membership card.
- All right.

01:53:17.423 --> 01:53:20.623
I was given this card
12 years ago.

01:53:21.857 --> 01:53:23.956
It's been in my wallet
ever since.

01:53:24.690 --> 01:53:26.755
In fact, I cried
when they gave me this card.

01:53:26.757 --> 01:53:29.790
And I grew up in a house where
I was taught men don't cry.

01:53:30.557 --> 01:53:32.057
But I cried anyway.

01:53:33.024 --> 01:53:36.658
I cried because it was the first
time in my life I didn't feel alone.

01:53:39.758 --> 01:53:41.923
Sure, I was married
with a family.

01:53:41.925 --> 01:53:44.556
That's not the kind of alone
I'm talking about.

01:53:44.558 --> 01:53:46.957
As a man, you're expected
to take care of that family.

01:53:48.291 --> 01:53:50.324
And I was havin' a hard time
doin' that.

01:53:51.057 --> 01:53:54.691
We were struggling.
So...

01:53:55.925 --> 01:53:58.255
There I was.
I was a part of something now.

01:53:58.257 --> 01:54:01.691
Something much,
much bigger than me.

01:54:03.558 --> 01:54:06.591
And then when they made me
president, boy, I was over the moon.

01:54:07.926 --> 01:54:10.192
Poor old C.P. Ellis
president of something.

01:54:11.826 --> 01:54:13.459
Whoa.

01:54:21.525 --> 01:54:23.592
And it's a real brotherhood.
It is.

01:54:23.892 --> 01:54:26.159
In the Klan,
you look out for one another.

01:54:26.592 --> 01:54:29.725
Nobody is left behind.
Everybody does for everybody else.

01:54:30.425 --> 01:54:32.256
In fact, it says it right
here on this card...

01:54:32.258 --> 01:54:35.959
It says
<i>"Non silba, sed anthar."</i>

01:54:37.092 --> 01:54:39.959
Which means "Not for
oneself, but for others."

01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:42.126
That's our motto.

01:54:45.626 --> 01:54:47.292
But see, now I got a problem.

01:54:48.593 --> 01:54:49.693
There's a problem...

01:54:51.493 --> 01:54:53.791
'cause there's a lot of that going
around right here in this room.

01:54:53.793 --> 01:54:55.127
People doin' for others.

01:54:56.927 --> 01:54:59.293
Last two weeks have been
full of people just do...

01:55:00.159 --> 01:55:01.359
doing for others.

01:55:02.493 --> 01:55:04.926
And they're not just white people.
There's a...

01:55:04.928 --> 01:55:07.259
There's a lot of black folk
doing for others too.

01:55:08.627 --> 01:55:10.324
But I'm the president
of the Klan.

01:55:10.326 --> 01:55:11.926
I'm supposed to hate
black folk.

01:55:11.928 --> 01:55:15.127
I teach people
to hate black folk.

01:55:17.060 --> 01:55:19.427
They're supposed to be
inferior to us.

01:55:22.093 --> 01:55:23.828
Now, if I don't believe that,

01:55:24.394 --> 01:55:27.427
then I have no business being
president of the Klan.

01:55:33.094 --> 01:55:34.394
Well, I don't believe it.

01:55:37.762 --> 01:55:39.160
So my problem is...

01:55:40.394 --> 01:55:42.294
I don't have no need
for this anymore.

01:55:57.628 --> 01:55:59.393
Mr. Riddick, I vote yes.

01:55:59.395 --> 01:56:00.328
Jesus!

01:56:17.295 --> 01:56:18.896
I just don't believe it.

01:56:28.396 --> 01:56:29.563
C.P.?

01:56:32.963 --> 01:56:34.062
C.P.?

01:57:13.832 --> 01:57:14.932
Yeah?

01:57:40.599 --> 01:57:41.732
Where's the key?

01:57:42.097 --> 01:57:43.899
Jeb!
Where's the key?

01:57:47.632 --> 01:57:49.164
Call the fire department!

01:57:56.766 --> 01:57:58.866
Come on.

01:58:47.266 --> 01:58:48.468
Thank you.

01:58:49.133 --> 01:58:52.734
Next on the agenda is delivery
of the charrette resolution.

01:58:53.267 --> 01:58:56.267
The council recognizes
Miss Atwater.

01:59:26.435 --> 01:59:28.202
Yeah. Hello?

02:00:23.437 --> 02:00:24.837
Okay, Mr. Ellis.

02:00:26.969 --> 02:00:28.103
How many?

02:00:28.471 --> 02:00:31.304
Well, you lost
about 650 gallons.

02:00:32.037 --> 02:00:33.737
You're lucky
the thing didn't explode.

02:00:34.270 --> 02:00:35.771
Yeah, okay.

02:00:36.270 --> 02:00:39.904
You want to replace the loss?
I can have a truck here tomorrow.

02:00:42.437 --> 02:00:44.570
No. Let's see how
the rest of the month goes.

02:00:44.572 --> 02:00:45.638
All right.

02:00:46.970 --> 02:00:49.472
What's this?
Would you sign both pages?

02:01:11.805 --> 02:01:12.939
Thank you, Mr. Ellis.

02:01:13.673 --> 02:01:15.171
Change your mind,
give us a call.

02:01:37.873 --> 02:01:39.606
Mr. Ellis.
Mm-hmm?

02:01:41.139 --> 02:01:43.139
If you need to let me go,
it's okay.

02:01:43.806 --> 02:01:45.906
You know,
until things pick up again.

02:01:47.439 --> 02:01:50.306
I appreciate that, Jeb.
But we're not there yet, okay?

02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:53.340
So for now, go ahead,
take your lunch break.

02:01:54.474 --> 02:01:56.105
Okay, Mr. Ellis.

02:01:56.873 --> 02:01:57.940
All right.

02:02:24.274 --> 02:02:28.104
I hope you didn't come here to
ask me to co-chair somethin' else.

02:02:28.106 --> 02:02:30.905
Nah. I just came
to say good-bye is all.

02:02:30.907 --> 02:02:33.675
Back to Raleigh, huh?
Back to Raleigh.

02:02:41.508 --> 02:02:43.106
What trouble you been causin'?

02:02:43.108 --> 02:02:45.707
Just organizing, you know me.

02:02:46.408 --> 02:02:48.807
It's what you do, right?
It's just what I do.

02:02:49.176 --> 02:02:50.906
I sure wish
you coulda been there

02:02:50.908 --> 02:02:53.473
when we handed in
our resolution. Mmm.

02:02:53.475 --> 02:02:55.707
Old Carvie Oldham
didn't even show up.

02:02:58.808 --> 02:03:00.276
Wish I'd seen that.

02:03:00.775 --> 02:03:02.142
How are you doin', C.P.?

02:03:03.009 --> 02:03:04.842
Oh, had a little trouble here.

02:03:06.009 --> 02:03:07.973
Just trying to
put it back together.

02:03:07.975 --> 02:03:09.342
Yeah, we heard.

02:03:10.375 --> 02:03:12.140
I'm so sorry, C.P.

02:03:12.142 --> 02:03:15.009
It's okay.
Although not sure it matters much.

02:03:15.775 --> 02:03:18.842
Nobody stoppin' to buy gas
from me these days.

02:03:21.277 --> 02:03:24.675
Well... Maybe things
will pick up for you.

02:03:26.442 --> 02:03:28.010
What you smilin' at?

02:04:00.011 --> 02:04:02.111
That's just what I do, C.P.

02:04:02.477 --> 02:04:04.744
You know that.
That's just what I do.

02:04:21.645 --> 02:04:24.744
Hey, Jeb. We got customers.

02:04:28.978 --> 02:04:31.645
Gas?

02:04:32.012 --> 02:04:33.643
- Gas?
- All right, sir.

02:04:33.645 --> 02:04:35.210
You want gas?

02:04:35.212 --> 02:04:37.012
- Yeah, no problem.
- All right.

02:04:55.479 --> 02:04:59.443
She can upset the world with
her mouth if she wants to.

02:04:59.445 --> 02:05:02.410
But everywhere I go,
every time I pick up a newspaper,

02:05:02.412 --> 02:05:05.744
Ann Atwater's been before the
council, the county commission,

02:05:05.746 --> 02:05:08.144
or she was at some
shopping center boycotting,

02:05:08.146 --> 02:05:09.913
or she was downtown
at Woolworths.

02:05:10.480 --> 02:05:12.444
And he was woofin'
and goin' on,

02:05:12.446 --> 02:05:14.545
and the place was packed
with Klansmen.

02:05:14.547 --> 02:05:18.046
This particular night, C.P.
was up raging and ranting.

02:05:18.647 --> 02:05:20.712
That's when
I wanted to cut his head off.

02:05:20.979 --> 02:05:22.944
And after that first meeting,

02:05:22.946 --> 02:05:25.446
I actually went home saying,
this is crazy.

02:05:25.746 --> 02:05:29.645
This is absolutely crazy.
I don't think I wanna do this.

02:05:29.647 --> 02:05:32.513
I mean, I can make a living
easier than this.

02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:42.614
The story was picked up
in <i>The Washington Post.</i>

02:05:43.313 --> 02:05:45.880
"Black man calls Klansman
'brother.'"

02:05:46.481 --> 02:05:50.614
And of course, my father, when he read
the story in <i>The Washington Post...</i>

02:05:51.680 --> 02:05:53.548
he thought I had lost my mind.

02:06:01.081 --> 02:06:06.948
In becoming my friend,
C.P. has lost a lot.

02:06:07.281 --> 02:06:10.649
Look, you do not make those changes
without having to pay for 'em.

02:06:11.048 --> 02:06:13.946
I know damn well, you know.

02:06:13.948 --> 02:06:15.681
You have to pay for it
eventually.

02:06:16.315 --> 02:06:18.979
We bonded,
and we are still bonding.

02:06:18.981 --> 02:06:20.879
Until I get mad with him
at times.

02:06:20.881 --> 02:06:24.779
But we've made it through these
years, together 30 years,

02:06:24.781 --> 02:06:26.382
and we're still friends.

02:06:47.650 --> 02:06:52.449
'Cause there are C.P. Ellises and Ann
Atwaters in almost every community.

02:06:53.682 --> 02:06:55.550
They just need
to be brought together

02:06:56.083 --> 02:06:59.650
and experience what we experienced
in Durham with that charrette.
