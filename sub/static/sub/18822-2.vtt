04:18.500 --> 04:20.209
- Ralph Spender.
- Pleased to meet you.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.410
Now, I just want you to know I
take this as seriously as you do,

04:23.460 --> 04:26.290
but believe me, there is
not one iota of truth in it.

04:26.340 --> 04:28.850
The Wildwood are nice, clean boys.

04:28.900 --> 04:32.210
The sort any girl'd be happy to
bring home to meet her parents.

04:32.260 --> 04:35.450
I don't think my parents would
like me to bring home a car thief.

04:35.500 --> 04:39.410
That was a complete misunderstanding.
The magistrates agreed.

04:39.460 --> 04:43.130
I'm telling you, they're good, clean
boys, with a good, clean image.

04:43.180 --> 04:45.090
- Nevertheless...
- The odd rum and coke,

04:45.140 --> 04:47.530
that's The Wildwood drink, yes.

04:47.580 --> 04:49.610
But drugs? No.

04:49.660 --> 04:52.930
- So, how do you explain
the marijuana? - I can't.

04:52.980 --> 04:56.820
Well... Fans maybe? The
press trying to make a story?

04:57.860 --> 05:00.850
Some of these other types from
the show. Television people.

05:00.900 --> 05:03.100
You know what they're like.

05:04.060 --> 05:06.410
"If you come to Oxford you will die."

05:06.460 --> 05:09.250
I received it yesterday,
Chief Superintendent.

05:09.300 --> 05:11.730
You wouldn't believe some
of my correspondence.

05:11.780 --> 05:13.780
I get dirty pictures.

05:14.380 --> 05:15.810
Dog mess.

05:15.860 --> 05:17.330
All sorts.

05:17.380 --> 05:20.530
- She does.
- People carrying on like animals.

05:20.580 --> 05:23.530
Quite, quite. But nothing like
this before? No direct threat?

05:23.580 --> 05:28.130
Well, there are always people who resent
those going about our Lord's work.

05:28.180 --> 05:31.410
But nobody specific comes
to mind, Mrs Pettybon?

05:31.460 --> 05:35.130
Well, a lot of people say a lot of
very unpleasant things, Inspector.

05:35.180 --> 05:37.930
If we took them all seriously...

05:37.980 --> 05:42.210
Your safety is our paramount
concern, of course. Thursday.

05:42.260 --> 05:45.500
Rest assured, Mrs Pettybon,
we'll put our best man on it.

05:46.140 --> 05:49.450
Let me just introduce the boys.

05:49.500 --> 05:53.300
Ken Wilding on guitar. Nick
his brother, lead vocals.

05:54.980 --> 05:59.210
Chris on the bass, and our resident
madcap on the drums, Stix Noble.

05:59.260 --> 06:02.490
So what's happening, then? The
Major says you're the police.

06:02.540 --> 06:06.330
A bag of pot and marijuana was found in
the common room yesterday, after you left.

06:06.380 --> 06:08.290
What is this, some sort of frame-up?

06:08.340 --> 06:11.650
- Come on, Ken. Don't be a drag.
- No, I'm dealing with this, Nick.

06:11.700 --> 06:14.250
So? If it's not a frame-up, what is it?

06:14.300 --> 06:17.090
- A shakedown, is that it?
- Ken! He doesn't mean that.

06:17.140 --> 06:19.210
Just pay the man, Ralph.

06:20.100 --> 06:22.890
Threatening to bribe a police
officer is a serious offence.

06:22.940 --> 06:25.090
I didn't. I told him to pay you.

06:25.140 --> 06:27.210
Now, excuse us. We've got a take to shoot.

06:27.260 --> 06:30.050
No. I may not be able to
connect you to this pot,

06:30.100 --> 06:33.500
but consider this an
informal caution. All of you.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.920
Informal. Thank you.

06:39.420 --> 06:42.250
Listen, let me send you
some promotional material.

06:42.300 --> 06:45.570
You can auction them. For the
police widows and orphans.

06:45.620 --> 06:48.930
A token of my appreciation, just
to show there's no hard feelings.

06:48.980 --> 06:51.650
The boys' latest LP, some glossies.

06:51.700 --> 06:53.090
All signed, naturally.

06:53.140 --> 06:57.040
Feel free to stick around and
watch the rest of the show.

06:57.820 --> 07:00.760
I've got better things to do with my time.

07:01.420 --> 07:02.650
Such as...?

07:02.700 --> 07:06.250
- What am I meant to do with her?
- Just keep an eye, that's all.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.970
She's only in town overnight.

07:08.020 --> 07:12.930
Part of this nationwide speaking tour
she's on. Church halls, town halls.

07:12.980 --> 07:14.690
Collecting signatures, isn't she?

07:14.740 --> 07:18.490
Yeah, some petition she means to hand in
to the Prime Minister at Downing Street.

07:18.540 --> 07:20.610
What do you make of it?

07:23.700 --> 07:26.370
Henley postmark. Sent four days ago.

07:27.420 --> 07:28.930
I can look into the typeface.

07:28.980 --> 07:34.020
I doubt we'll have much luck after
all the hands it's been through,
but best get it fingerprinted.

07:35.180 --> 07:38.290
- How did you get on at the college?
- Couldn't tie them to the pot,

07:38.340 --> 07:40.970
so I just gave the manager
an informal caution.

07:41.020 --> 07:44.660
I don't know why they bother with the
stuff. Never did anything for me.

07:45.260 --> 07:47.570
You've smoked pot? When?

07:47.620 --> 07:51.650
Up the desert. They
called it kif out there.

07:51.700 --> 07:53.530
Some of the lads were silly with it.

07:53.580 --> 07:56.690
- You ever tried it?
- I'm a serving police officer.

07:56.740 --> 07:59.730
Besides, I like to keep a clear head.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.010
- Put enough beer away.
- Beer's brain food.

08:02.060 --> 08:06.890
Sir. Uniform's asking us to attend
a body found behind the Crown pub.

08:06.940 --> 08:08.410
Looks like foul play.

08:08.460 --> 08:11.450
Body was found about an
hour ago by the landlord.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.770
No wallet or other means
of identification.

08:13.820 --> 08:16.490
He isn't a regular, and he
wasn't in the bar last night.

08:16.540 --> 08:20.450
- What time did the landlord last check the
yard? - Nine o'clock yesterday evening.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.770
Still light. If he was
here, he would've seen him.

08:23.820 --> 08:26.450
A neighbour heard a car
about three in the morning.

08:26.500 --> 08:29.130
Apart from that, nothing
out of the ordinary.

08:29.180 --> 08:31.090
- Doctor.
- Inspector.

08:31.140 --> 08:34.250
Adult male. Earlyto mid-twenties.

08:34.299 --> 08:37.289
Died some time between eight
and midnight last night.

08:37.340 --> 08:41.210
Strangled with a ligature about
the thickness of my finger.

08:41.260 --> 08:43.010
Sash cord, perhaps?

08:43.059 --> 08:49.130
He's as I found him, but postmortem
lividity says he died on his front.

08:49.180 --> 08:51.050
Note the marks on the side of his torso.

08:51.100 --> 08:54.370
- He's been moved.
- Within an hour or two of his decease.

08:54.420 --> 08:58.850
Be able to give you furthers and
betters once I've opened him up.

08:58.900 --> 09:01.890
- Any Missing Persons in overnight?
- No, sir.

09:01.940 --> 09:04.970
- Manual labourer, maybe?
- State of his boots, you mean?

09:05.020 --> 09:07.490
Hm. Cement or concrete in the tread.

09:07.540 --> 09:10.930
I'll get Uniform to put the
word out to local building sites.

09:10.980 --> 09:13.320
Anybody that's not turned in.

09:23.420 --> 09:26.410
I know. I know. It's disgusting.

09:26.460 --> 09:30.130
Er, Mrs Pettybon will be
a moment. The Daily Mail.

09:30.180 --> 09:33.810
We counted 14 "bloodies",
six "bleedings"...

09:33.860 --> 09:35.250
What else, Bettina?

09:35.300 --> 09:39.090
- Er, two "bleeders" and a "bastard".
- Two "bleeders" and a "bastard".

09:39.140 --> 09:43.890
- Sounds like a regular evening down the nick.
- And this is a family programme!

09:43.940 --> 09:47.820
Well, I shall be very interested
to read your article. God bless.

09:50.500 --> 09:53.290
Well, this is your best man, is it?

09:53.340 --> 09:58.010
- Detective Constable Morse.
- Mrs Joy Pettybon. Widow.

09:58.060 --> 10:00.330
Er, Reverend Golightly
you know, Inspector.

10:00.380 --> 10:03.050
May I introduce my daughter Bettina?

10:03.460 --> 10:07.170
- And may I give you one of these to wear?
- I wouldn't be allowed, madam.

10:07.220 --> 10:11.890
- As a police officer, I have to
remain impartial. - No-one could
argue with the sentiment, surely?

10:11.940 --> 10:13.650
Someone could, plainly.

10:13.700 --> 10:16.650
Wearing that could be seen
to betoken an affiliation,

10:16.700 --> 10:19.890
and we have to go about our business
without fear or favour to any.

10:19.940 --> 10:21.970
But, er, when you're not on duty?

10:22.020 --> 10:25.380
A police officer's always on duty,
Reverend. Much like yourself.

10:26.580 --> 10:30.010
I'll need a copy of your
itinerary while you're in Oxford.

10:30.060 --> 10:31.930
Well, we'll be here, mostly.

10:31.980 --> 10:35.410
Joy will be appearing on the
Almanac TV programme this evening.

10:35.460 --> 10:38.410
It's being filmed at Sierra
Television Studios in Aston.

10:38.460 --> 10:41.930
In Birmingham? Oh, I'm sorry,
that's beyond our jurisdiction.

10:41.980 --> 10:44.970
I was assured by the Chief
Constable of your full cooperation.

10:45.020 --> 10:49.730
Detective Constable Morse will be on hand
throughout to ensure nothing untoward befalls.

10:49.780 --> 10:51.720
You can rely on him.

10:54.660 --> 10:57.650
What is it, do you
think, with Mrs Pettybon?

10:57.700 --> 11:01.010
Well, she's clearly got a talent
for rubbing people up the wrong way.

11:01.060 --> 11:03.450
Look, do you really want
me on baby-sitting duty?

11:03.500 --> 11:07.250
- What about this body in the pub yard?
- Mr Steve Carter, sir.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.210
Come in to report his labourer
not turned up this morning.

11:10.260 --> 11:13.260
Description matches our
body behind the pub.

11:15.300 --> 11:19.900
It's like I told him. He
didn't turn in for work.

11:19.980 --> 11:23.810
I'm a brickie. Your mate don't
show up, you're in lumber.

11:23.860 --> 11:28.530
So I give his old woman a ring, his
mum, like, to see where he'd been.

11:28.580 --> 11:31.610
Well, she said that Barry never come home.

11:31.660 --> 11:33.450
And it's Barry Finch, you said?

11:33.500 --> 11:34.890
Like the bird. Yeah.

11:34.940 --> 11:38.170
- You last saw him
yesterday evening. - Yeah.

11:38.220 --> 11:42.530
I knocked off about five. Was
gonna give him a lift back.

11:42.580 --> 11:45.730
But he decided to stay
on for a bit, have a swim.

11:45.780 --> 11:47.810
A swim? Where were you working, then?

11:47.860 --> 11:51.700
Maplewick Hall. Big old
place out by Banbury.

11:52.500 --> 11:55.450
Barry couldn't keep his mind
on the job half the time,

11:55.500 --> 11:59.770
what with all the birds and that they've got
up there, wandering around in their altogether.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.860
- How's that? - Bunch of pop
stars up there at the minute.

12:03.620 --> 12:05.620
The Wildwood.

13:14.680 --> 13:17.390
Everything was all right between
him and Mr Carter, was it?

13:17.440 --> 13:20.190
Steve? Yes, he's been very good to Barry.

13:20.240 --> 13:24.030
Must have been delighted to be at Maplewick
Hall, being such a fan of the group?

13:24.080 --> 13:25.710
Oh, yes. He was made up.

13:25.760 --> 13:29.030
He likes a lot of these groups, but
The Wildwood was his favourite.

13:29.080 --> 13:32.350
Can you think of anyone who
would wish him any ill?

13:32.400 --> 13:36.790
No-one had a bad word to say about
him. He'd do anything for anyone.

13:36.840 --> 13:38.640
Why would any...?

13:39.560 --> 13:43.360
You find who hurt him.
You find who hurt my baby.

13:44.440 --> 13:47.840
We will, Mrs Finch. That's a promise.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.870
Canada's a big territory, Louis.

14:05.120 --> 14:08.760
Listen, I've got to go. Get me those
percentages as soon as you can.

14:11.040 --> 14:14.270
Detective Inspector
Thursday. Ralph Spender, sir.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.670
Inspector? I thought
we'd sorted all that out.

14:16.720 --> 14:19.030
This is about another matter.

14:19.080 --> 14:22.030
There's a body been found, sir,
back of a pub yard in town.

14:22.080 --> 14:24.110
Young man called Barry Finch.

14:24.160 --> 14:27.830
He's been working here as a labourer
with a bricklayer, name of Carter.

14:27.880 --> 14:29.950
Yeah. Yeah, that Barry.

14:31.280 --> 14:33.220
Very nice young man.

14:34.280 --> 14:36.910
Please. Can I offer you a cigar?

14:36.960 --> 14:39.030
I won't, thank you, sir.

14:39.440 --> 14:42.870
The last sighting we have of
him alive is here last night.

14:42.920 --> 14:44.950
He was staying on for a swim.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.350
Well... I was in London.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.630
I've... I have an office
there. Mount Street.

14:50.680 --> 14:53.590
- Anyone confirm that?
- My mother.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.430
Phyllis.

14:55.480 --> 14:59.390
Bruno, my driver, he dropped
me home about seven o'clock.

14:59.440 --> 15:05.040
I spent most of the evening on the telephone to
colleagues in New York and, later, California.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.430
I'm planning a big tour for
the boys there next month.

15:09.480 --> 15:11.150
With The Kinks.

15:12.360 --> 15:14.590
On "eyes", you walk it down to the G.

15:14.640 --> 15:16.120
♪ Eyes

15:19.640 --> 15:21.750
A. G sharp.

15:21.800 --> 15:24.190
Oh, no, no, no. G sharp sounds horrible.

15:24.240 --> 15:25.550
That's good, cos...

15:25.600 --> 15:28.950
Nick? Nick, can you
just leave off a minute?

15:29.000 --> 15:30.510
I wanna try my new one.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.470
Not more tales of courtly
love from Tres Riches Heures?

15:33.520 --> 15:36.790
- My Sweet Lady Kate was top five.
- Yeah, we looked like a bunch of ponces.

15:36.840 --> 15:39.040
Yeah, so, what is it, then?

15:40.680 --> 15:42.670
Based on this poem by Baudelaire.

15:42.720 --> 15:45.110
Oh, no! Not more nursery rhyme stuff?

15:45.160 --> 15:47.230
- It's something new.
- It's not, though.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.070
Whatever happened to...?
♪ I woke up this morning!

15:50.120 --> 15:53.110
Ken's right. It's not rock-and-roll, man.

15:53.160 --> 15:56.070
You might've forgotten where you
come from, but us lot haven't.

15:56.120 --> 15:59.560
- Take the boy out the Goldhawk Road?
- Yeah, that's right.

16:01.880 --> 16:03.590
All right, he didn't mean it.

16:03.640 --> 16:06.830
You keep your Baudelaire and I'll
stick to Bo Diddley, all right?

16:06.880 --> 16:08.590
I'm going outside for a fag.

16:08.640 --> 16:11.510
- Chris?
- Sort him out.

16:11.560 --> 16:14.590
- Tell him I'm sorry.
- No, you should tell him, not me.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.150
Boys. Boys.

16:17.200 --> 16:19.470
These gentlemen just want a word.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.230
Oh, yeah? What are we supposed
to have done this time?

16:22.280 --> 16:24.620
It's the brickie's boy. Barry.

16:25.200 --> 16:28.070
- He's dead.
- Dead?

16:28.120 --> 16:30.750
How? What happened? Did he
have an accident or something?

16:30.800 --> 16:33.000
It appears he was murdered.

16:39.280 --> 16:43.190
Mr Carter said that Barry stayed on
after work for a swim. Is that right?

16:43.240 --> 16:45.110
- Yeah.
- Who asked him to stay?

16:45.160 --> 16:47.270
- Nobody.
- What time did he leave?

16:47.320 --> 16:50.800
- He was here till about eight o'clock.
- It was about quarter to.

16:51.840 --> 16:54.830
- And you are, miss?
- Pippa. Leyton.

16:54.880 --> 16:58.840
The girls help out as seamstresses
with the boys' stage clothes.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.710
Is that right?

17:02.760 --> 17:06.910
- How old are you?
- 18... Next birthday.

17:06.960 --> 17:09.790
- And you, miss?
- Emma Carr.

17:09.839 --> 17:13.589
- We're not doing anything wrong.
- Course you're not. It's a free country.

17:13.640 --> 17:16.270
Did anybody see which way
Mr Finch went when he left?

17:16.319 --> 17:19.310
He said he was going to hitch a
lift back into town, didn't he?

17:19.359 --> 17:21.550
I thought you said you were in London.

17:21.599 --> 17:25.470
Yes, I think Ken told me. Didn't you, Ken?

17:25.520 --> 17:28.390
Yeah. That's right.

17:28.440 --> 17:31.480
That's what he usually
did if he stayed on late.

17:35.600 --> 17:38.400
- There's two more, aren't there? - Mm.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.510
What happened to him? Barry?

17:57.560 --> 17:59.590
That's what we're here to find out, sir.

17:59.640 --> 18:03.950
- I mean, was there an accident, or what?
- It would appear not, Mr...

18:04.000 --> 18:05.560
Oh, sorry.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.720
Christopher Clark.

18:10.040 --> 18:11.840
Stix. The drummer.

18:13.480 --> 18:16.430
- Anna-Britt, Chris's...
- Chris's wife.

18:16.480 --> 18:19.830
Only, for some reason, we're
not allowed to tell anyone.

18:19.880 --> 18:23.150
It's just business. The fans don't
want to know the boys are married.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.710
You offered Barry a
job, didn't you, Ralph?

18:25.760 --> 18:28.430
Well... No.

18:28.480 --> 18:29.950
No?

18:30.000 --> 18:33.480
- He seemed to think you had.
- I said, if something came up.

18:34.560 --> 18:36.390
Driving or...

18:36.440 --> 18:38.070
It wasn't a firm offer.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.150
He was a bit starstruck, that's all.

18:40.200 --> 18:43.790
And was everything all right between
him and his colleague, Mr Carter?

18:43.840 --> 18:47.640
As far as we know. Look, we really didn't
have much to do with either of them.

18:49.840 --> 18:53.350
Dr Bakshi. He looks after the boys.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.070
Oh, yes? In what way?

18:55.120 --> 18:59.000
These gentlemen are with the police.
One of the labourers has, um...

19:00.080 --> 19:02.470
- .. has died.
- I see.

19:02.520 --> 19:08.110
In answer to your question, I tend to the group's
wellbeing -- physical, mental and spiritual.

19:08.160 --> 19:11.550
As a matter of fact, I have a
four o'clock session with Nick,

19:11.600 --> 19:14.270
to prepare him for
tonight's TV performance.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.230
Unless you've any objection.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.950
Very well, sir.

19:28.160 --> 19:31.200
- You think he left here?
- Do you?

19:33.880 --> 19:36.420
They're a rum lot, and no mistake.

19:36.840 --> 19:40.280
And I wouldn't trust that manager
as far as I could throw him.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.760
Now... Here's fun.

19:58.280 --> 20:02.030
The late Barry Finch. Brickie's
labourer to the stars.

20:02.080 --> 20:04.670
- Cause of death...
- The strangulation?

20:04.720 --> 20:08.030
Oh, he was strangled, yes. Several times.

20:08.080 --> 20:10.230
Only, that's not what killed him.

20:10.280 --> 20:13.590
It wasn't asphyxia. His heart gave out.

20:13.640 --> 20:18.430
The strangulation occurred perimortem,
on or about the moment of death.

20:18.480 --> 20:20.350
He was already dying.

20:20.400 --> 20:23.390
But couldn't the strangulation
have caused the heart seizure?

20:23.440 --> 20:28.550
Certainly. When sudden pressure is
put on the vagus nerve in the neck,

20:28.600 --> 20:30.550
instantaneous death can happen.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.540
But you see, if I...

20:33.240 --> 20:36.070
Now, what's the first
thing you're going to do?

20:36.120 --> 20:38.750
- Try and get it off.
- Ah, try, yes.

20:38.800 --> 20:43.230
Now, a case like this, one would expect
to find abrasions, scratches to the neck,

20:43.280 --> 20:46.630
the victim's own skin and
flesh under their fingernails.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.030
And that's not the case with Mr Finch?

20:49.080 --> 20:50.630
No.

20:50.680 --> 20:51.990
Mm.

20:52.040 --> 20:54.980
- Would you, er...?
- Oh, yes. Of course.

20:58.280 --> 21:00.390
What if his hands weren't free?

21:00.440 --> 21:02.670
There's nothing to suggest he was bound.

21:02.720 --> 21:05.920
No chafing to the wrists, no
bruises to say he was restrained.

21:06.920 --> 21:08.910
It doesn't make sense.

21:08.960 --> 21:12.670
- Why strangle a dying man?
- Well, that's your department, thankfully.

21:12.720 --> 21:17.600
I'm more concerned as to what would stop
the heart of an otherwise fit 24-year-old.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.390
His bits and bobs are on the side there.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.640
There's nothing remarkable.

21:29.400 --> 21:33.190
Why would someone want to make
it look like murder if it wasn't?

21:33.240 --> 21:35.710
Nothing really adds up, does it?

21:59.640 --> 22:02.070
- You following us?
- No.

22:02.120 --> 22:03.990
I'm here with Mrs Pettybon.

22:04.040 --> 22:06.950
That batty old woman? Someone
wants to put her straight.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.830
- Someone's threatened to.
- Threatened to what? Do her in?

22:10.880 --> 22:14.230
Blimey. That's a bit much. I
mean, she's mad as a March hare,

22:14.280 --> 22:16.470
but you wouldn't want
anything to happen to her.

22:16.520 --> 22:18.600
Silly cow.

22:55.920 --> 22:57.670
Like the clobber?

22:57.720 --> 22:59.790
Everyone's wearing them.

23:00.400 --> 23:03.270
So, thank you and good evening.

23:03.320 --> 23:07.870
Welcome to Almanac, half an hour
of music, chat and current affairs.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.830
And what a show we have for you tonight.

23:09.880 --> 23:14.950
Coming up later, we have an exclusive
interview with Nick Wilding of The Wildwood.

23:18.520 --> 23:23.720
Steady, girls. And his group will be performing
their latest sound, Jennifer Sometimes.

23:24.560 --> 23:27.830
"His group"? That's nice. "His group."

23:27.880 --> 23:29.310
But before that,

23:29.360 --> 23:33.470
I'm going to be talking to the leader of
the National Clean Up Television Society,

23:33.520 --> 23:36.190
figurehead of the Keep
Britain Decent campaign

23:36.240 --> 23:38.350
and guardian of the nation's morals.

23:38.400 --> 23:42.120
Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Joy Pettybon!

23:49.320 --> 23:52.310
Thank you for having me on
your programme, Mr Calendar.

23:52.360 --> 23:55.910
Not at all. And, erm, "Julian", please.

23:55.960 --> 24:00.710
Now, Mrs Pettybon, I understand you're
on something of a crusade at the moment?

24:00.760 --> 24:07.350
I wouldn't put it in those terms, but, yes, I
suppose what we're doing is the Lord's work.

24:07.400 --> 24:11.430
You're travelling up and down the country
collecting signatures for a petition, right?

24:11.480 --> 24:14.510
- We are. - And what's it
calling for, this petition?

24:14.560 --> 24:19.750
Well, amongst other things, decency
on television and on the wireless.

24:19.800 --> 24:24.350
I was going to come on to the wireless, or
the radio, as we tend to call it nowadays,

24:24.400 --> 24:27.070
because one of the people
you've been complaining about

24:27.120 --> 24:31.030
in fact, you've actually called for his
record to be banned from the airwaves,

24:31.080 --> 24:33.190
is in the studio with us tonight.

24:33.240 --> 24:35.510
- Is that right?
- That is right, yes.

24:35.560 --> 24:38.710
It is, of course, Nick Wilding
of the pop group The Wildwood.

24:38.760 --> 24:42.630
- Feet up. - What is it you
don't like about his music?

24:42.680 --> 24:46.590
It's not the music, is it?
Of course it's too loud,

24:46.640 --> 24:50.910
but it's the words that
I object to. The words.

24:50.960 --> 24:54.030
- What's wrong with them?
- Well, if you want me to spell it out,

24:54.080 --> 24:59.670
this record they have at the minute, it's
about S-E-X, isn't it? And drug-taking.

24:59.720 --> 25:02.950
All right. Well, you can put those
charges to him yourself in a moment,

25:03.000 --> 25:07.990
but first, let's get an earful,
hear what all the fuss is about.

25:08.040 --> 25:11.110
Here they are, ladies and
gentlemen. Lock up your daughters!

25:11.160 --> 25:15.230
It's The Wildwood with their
new sound, Jennifer Sometimes.

25:23.200 --> 25:26.710
♪ Jennifer sometimes sits in the sunshine

25:26.760 --> 25:30.670
♪ Playing with her hair

25:30.720 --> 25:32.670
♪ Go back to the old school

25:32.720 --> 25:34.830
♪ Look under a toadstool

25:34.880 --> 25:38.520
♪ There's nobody there

25:39.000 --> 25:41.110
♪ Jennifer sometimes...

25:41.160 --> 25:44.510
- Mind! - Since when
have you watched Almanac?

25:44.560 --> 25:47.070
- It's work.
- What work?

25:47.120 --> 25:48.990
Mrs Pettybon.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.070
Morse is on duty with her.

25:51.120 --> 25:52.790
There have been threats.

25:52.840 --> 25:56.070
I'm not surprised, telling people
what they should and shouldn't.

25:56.120 --> 25:57.950
"Decency"!

25:58.000 --> 26:00.940
She just likes the sound of her own voice.

26:02.840 --> 26:06.040
Aren't those the ones that
Joan likes? The Wildwood?

26:06.840 --> 26:08.580
I wouldn't know.

26:09.680 --> 26:11.390
You would.

26:11.440 --> 26:14.430
You fetched their first record
for her from Woolworths.

26:14.480 --> 26:15.830
If you say so.

26:15.880 --> 26:18.980
What? We're not allowed
to talk about her now?

26:19.440 --> 26:21.910
- Fred?
- What's there to talk about?

26:21.960 --> 26:23.900
You don't mean that.

26:24.560 --> 26:27.430
If she was gonna call, she'd have called.

27:05.960 --> 27:07.790
All right?

27:07.840 --> 27:09.780
- Yes, I...
- Oh...

27:11.080 --> 27:13.990
I get nervous when Mummy
makes an appearance.

27:14.040 --> 27:16.760
I have to step out. It's my vice.

27:18.840 --> 27:20.800
Filthy habit.

27:21.800 --> 27:24.830
You mustn't worry. The
world's full of cranks.

27:24.880 --> 27:27.960
You probably think
Mummy's a bit of a crank.

27:30.720 --> 27:33.630
I'm sure she's... sincere.

27:33.680 --> 27:36.190
She is.

27:36.240 --> 27:38.670
How long has she been, erm...?

27:38.720 --> 27:41.110
Oh, erm, about four years.

27:41.160 --> 27:44.480
But she... she really got into
it after Daddy passed away.

27:46.120 --> 27:48.790
- He was a wonderful man.
- Was he?

27:50.240 --> 27:53.240
- We should probably
go back inside. - Yes.

27:54.400 --> 27:56.950
Oh, you... you won't tell
her? About the cigarette?

27:57.000 --> 27:59.400
- No. No, no, no.
- Thank you.

28:06.600 --> 28:11.670
These are symptoms of a godless
and degenerate society.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.510
There was this programme last week,

28:13.560 --> 28:18.150
and it was the dirtiest
programme I have ever seen!

28:18.200 --> 28:20.110
- Dirty?
- Well, it was.

28:20.160 --> 28:23.670
What do you mean? The people
in it hadn't had a wash?

28:23.720 --> 28:25.150
You know very well what I mean.

28:25.200 --> 28:27.870
I don't. Honestly.

28:27.920 --> 28:30.230
- What's dirty?
- What's dirty?

28:30.280 --> 28:32.270
Dirty's dirty. That's what dirty is.

28:32.320 --> 28:35.390
But what's dirty to you might be
quite acceptable to somebody else.

28:35.440 --> 28:37.990
- Quite normal, in fact.
- This wasn't normal.

28:38.040 --> 28:40.190
It made me physically sick.

28:40.240 --> 28:41.910
What was wrong with it, then?

28:41.960 --> 28:44.870
It was about two of these
so-called homosexuals.

28:44.920 --> 28:46.350
How do you mean "so-called"?

28:46.400 --> 28:51.190
- The Good Book has a different name for them.
- Has it? Well, what's that, then?

28:51.240 --> 28:52.760
Sodomites.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.110
Everywhere I look, I'm having
it rammed down my throat.

28:57.160 --> 29:00.200
Well, I don't want it in my
lounge. The permissive society!

29:01.320 --> 29:04.910
Yes! That's what they call it.
Well, nobody asked my permission.

29:04.960 --> 29:08.430
- Bravo! Well said!
- They shouldn't do it!

29:08.480 --> 29:09.630
Rubbish!

29:09.680 --> 29:12.910
- All right, sir.
- Absolute rubbish!

29:12.960 --> 29:16.510
- It's not rubbish!
- Sorry. Who put you in charge?

29:16.560 --> 29:21.270
Where do you get off telling us
what we can or can't see or hear?

29:21.320 --> 29:24.630
What about freedom of artistic expression?

29:24.680 --> 29:27.590
Don't touch... Do not
touch me! Don't touch me!

29:27.640 --> 29:30.000
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

29:39.880 --> 29:43.510
Well, there we are, ladies and gentlemen.

29:43.560 --> 29:47.350
All the fun and excitement of live
broadcasting. Never a dull moment.

29:47.400 --> 29:49.590
If we might return now
to the matter at hand.

29:49.640 --> 29:53.140
Mrs Pettybon, you were
talking about what's dirty...

29:57.000 --> 29:58.830
You wanted to see me?

29:58.880 --> 30:00.280
Oh, yeah.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.590
Bloke dropped it off at the front desk.

30:04.640 --> 30:07.590
Oh, Sergeant. Any
developments on this labourer?

30:07.640 --> 30:09.190
- Barry Finch, sir.
- Just so.

30:09.240 --> 30:12.270
I'm seeing the Assistant Chief
Constable later. He's bound to ask.

30:12.320 --> 30:13.670
Nothing much to go on, sir.

30:13.720 --> 30:18.550
A person of previous good character,
choirboy at St Mary's, till his voice broke.

30:18.600 --> 30:21.150
No enemies that we know
of, no criminal record.

30:21.200 --> 30:24.280
What about this mark on his body?

30:24.920 --> 30:27.920
Just trying to figure
that out myself, sir.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.240
X marks the spot.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.510
All right! All right! That's enough!

30:33.560 --> 30:35.830
- Want some too, do you?
- I'm a police officer!

30:35.880 --> 30:39.150
- My warrant card, if you can read.
- It's the kiddies we're thinking of.

30:39.200 --> 30:42.720
- He's a bloody pervert!
- On your way! Go on!

30:43.480 --> 30:45.080
Come on.

30:47.760 --> 30:50.470
Come on. Let's get you... Come on.

30:50.520 --> 30:52.190
You all right?

30:55.440 --> 30:58.950
- Are you OK?
- Do I look it?

30:59.000 --> 31:01.320
The woman's a monster!

31:02.000 --> 31:04.550
She had me prosecuted, didn't she?

31:04.600 --> 31:06.400
How's that, Mr...?

31:07.160 --> 31:10.150
Jessop. Dudley Jessop.

31:10.200 --> 31:12.870
I run...

31:12.920 --> 31:15.350
I ran... a magazine.

31:15.400 --> 31:17.600
The Exciting Times.

31:18.200 --> 31:23.720
Mrs Pettybon took exception against
our schoolboys' edition and...

31:25.480 --> 31:28.150
.. and tried to do me for blasphemy.

31:29.520 --> 31:34.120
Oh, I wrote an article that considered
Jesus and St Peter as lovers.

31:35.600 --> 31:38.070
I can see how that might
rub her up the wrong way.

31:38.120 --> 31:39.920
It was about love.

31:40.640 --> 31:42.640
She said it was dirty.

31:43.960 --> 31:46.150
How can love be dirty?

31:46.200 --> 31:49.470
Well, if it isn't, I expect
you're not doing it right.

31:50.920 --> 31:54.350
I thought that went well. Apart from
that little bit of unpleasantness.

31:54.400 --> 31:58.350
Well, some of your supporters have just
beaten the living daylights out of him.

31:58.400 --> 32:01.640
- You're mistaken.
- I saw it, Mrs Pettybon.

32:02.200 --> 32:04.430
But you did ever so well.

32:04.480 --> 32:08.830
- Didn't she, Reverend?
- Oh, yes, yes. Marvellously well.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.030
Well-wishers.

32:11.080 --> 32:13.070
Flowers and chocolates, I believe.

32:13.120 --> 32:15.670
Just take it all back to
the hotel for now, Mervyn.

32:15.720 --> 32:18.920
We'll dispense them to the
sick and needy in the morning.

32:35.720 --> 32:37.870
Well, I'll, er... You must be tired.

32:37.920 --> 32:40.920
- I'll say good night.
- Good night, Mervyn.

32:42.920 --> 32:45.960
- If there was nothing else...
- Are you saved, Constable?

32:46.680 --> 32:50.230
More squandered, I'm afraid.
We've a uniform officer outside.

32:50.280 --> 32:53.440
Should help you to sleep safely,
without any further worries.

32:58.760 --> 33:00.280
Mr Morse?

33:00.960 --> 33:02.600
I...

33:09.720 --> 33:15.280
I don't suppose I could ask you
to open my window for me, could I?

33:16.720 --> 33:19.750
It sticks somewhat, and
it was so hot last night.

33:19.800 --> 33:21.800
Yes.

33:24.900 --> 33:26.480
Thank you.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.470
Just a little stiff, that's all.

33:31.760 --> 33:35.480
Would... Would you, erm, care for a drink?

33:36.600 --> 33:39.000
Oh, it's been quite a long day.

33:39.160 --> 33:40.800
Of course.

33:41.800 --> 33:43.510
- I'm sorry.
- No, no.

33:43.560 --> 33:47.510
I'm sure one drink wouldn't do any
harm. Though it has gone 12 o'clock.

33:47.560 --> 33:50.310
- I doubt the bar will
still be open. - I...

33:50.360 --> 33:52.270
I've got a bottle.

33:52.320 --> 33:56.110
If you don't mind vodka. And there's
a glass for water by the carafe.

33:56.160 --> 33:59.100
I can get a tooth glass from the bathroom.

33:59.760 --> 34:01.960
Won't that be a bit minty?

34:02.520 --> 34:04.590
Oh, I don't mind minty.

34:18.960 --> 34:23.110
♪ Jennifer sometimes sits in the sunshine

34:23.159 --> 34:25.600
♪ Playing with her hair

34:26.880 --> 34:31.949
♪ Back in the old
school..... a toadstool...

34:32.000 --> 34:34.560
♪ There's nobody there

34:44.280 --> 34:47.870
Thank you. For looking after Mummy.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.860
Oh... Not a problem.

34:50.560 --> 34:54.040
Cases like this, I think it's
better to be safe than sorry.

34:55.239 --> 34:59.360
I don't know what she'd say at me
having a strange man in my room.

35:00.240 --> 35:03.240
I'd hate to be the cause
of any difficulty.

35:04.680 --> 35:09.720
- In fact, I should probably go.
- Oh... Have another. Please. I...

35:11.040 --> 35:15.160
I don't get to speak to many people
besides Mummy and Reverend Golightly.

35:16.240 --> 35:18.430
Am I keeping you from someone?

35:18.480 --> 35:20.070
Your... Your wife?

35:20.120 --> 35:21.310
No.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.160
- Fiancee?
- No.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.900
The only thing I have waiting
for me at my flat is Wagner.

35:29.440 --> 35:32.070
- That's sad.
- There are worse things.

35:32.120 --> 35:35.440
Are there? I can't think of any.

35:37.640 --> 35:42.350
- I know what it's like to be lonely.
- I'm not... particularly.

35:42.400 --> 35:44.000
Really?

35:45.040 --> 35:46.780
You seem lonely.

35:56.800 --> 35:58.470
God forgive me.

35:59.360 --> 36:01.030
God forgive me.

36:03.080 --> 36:04.950
God forgive me.

36:07.200 --> 36:09.200
Hello? Chambermaid.

36:11.080 --> 36:12.400
Hello?

36:20.800 --> 36:22.680
Sir?

36:44.420 --> 36:47.190
Dead about six hours.

36:47.240 --> 36:50.670
- Two or three in the night?
- Around then.

36:50.720 --> 36:54.350
- Cause? - I shan't know
till I've had a grub about.

36:54.400 --> 36:56.550
But something disagreed with him, plainly.

36:56.600 --> 37:00.040
Half-digested chocolates
amongst the ejecta.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.790
Where did they come from?

37:03.840 --> 37:06.070
She received boxes of them last night.

37:06.120 --> 37:08.750
Mrs Pettybon. After the Almanac show.

37:08.800 --> 37:11.110
Chocolates. Flowers. From well-wishers.

37:11.160 --> 37:12.590
Happens wherever she goes.

37:12.640 --> 37:14.790
Could someone have laced
them with something?

37:14.840 --> 37:16.920
Yes, perhaps.

37:17.840 --> 37:20.160
- Doctor.
- Gentlemen.

37:23.880 --> 37:27.760
Poor Reverend Golightly.
He had such a sweet tooth.

37:28.240 --> 37:31.320
Didn't seem any harm in it.
He was always so helpful.

37:32.360 --> 37:34.430
I just didn't like to make a fuss.

37:34.480 --> 37:37.910
Is there any way to find out
who donated the chocolates?

37:37.960 --> 37:40.750
People leave them on the stage
or send them to my dressing room.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.230
- We don't keep a register.
- What, you think...?

37:43.280 --> 37:47.440
- You think they were meant for Mummy?
- It's possible, miss.

37:48.640 --> 37:51.950
There was a disturbance at the
Almanac programme last night.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.310
A man called Dudley Jessop.

37:54.360 --> 37:55.950
He's a degenerate.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.470
You tried to have him prosecuted
for blasphemy, is that right?

37:59.520 --> 38:02.360
Someone had to stand up for Our Lord.

38:05.240 --> 38:08.800
- You were meant to keep us safe!
- The threat was made against you.

38:09.480 --> 38:12.280
So far as I can see, you're still here.

38:20.720 --> 38:23.520
I really don't know why you've come by.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.830
I said I didn't want to press charges.

38:25.880 --> 38:29.070
We're not here to talk about
your beating, Mr Jessop.

38:29.120 --> 38:31.510
We're here to talk about Mrs Pettybon.

38:31.560 --> 38:34.030
She got your magazine closed down.

38:34.080 --> 38:35.750
Exciting Times. Isn't that right?

38:35.800 --> 38:39.590
She also landed me with a criminal
record and a prison sentence.

38:39.640 --> 38:42.710
Oh, and brought me to
bankruptcy into the bargain.

38:42.760 --> 38:45.390
I imagine you don't much
care for Mrs Pettybon.

38:45.440 --> 38:47.910
I'm living on handouts...

38:47.960 --> 38:50.110
and a small allowance from my parents,

38:50.160 --> 38:52.950
on the understanding I never
darken their door again.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.720
I can't get a job. I'm...

38:58.320 --> 39:01.790
So, yes, it would be fair to say
I pretty much hate Joy Pettybon.

39:01.840 --> 39:05.440
- Enough to do something about it?
- I am doing something about it.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.030
With what little money I do have,
I follow her around the country

39:09.080 --> 39:11.470
and do my best to denounce
her for what she is.

39:11.520 --> 39:13.860
- What's that?
- A hypocrite!

39:14.440 --> 39:19.110
She stands on her soapbox in that harridan
hat and those Hedda Hopper glasses.

39:19.160 --> 39:21.950
The woman clearly wouldn't
know couture from a dog turd,

39:22.000 --> 39:27.230
and she stands there, with that
pantomime horse of a vicar egging her on,

39:27.280 --> 39:30.150
spouting bile and hatred,

39:30.200 --> 39:34.080
and she has the brass neck
to call herself a Christian?

39:40.160 --> 39:43.160
And what about doing
anything else about it?

39:43.480 --> 39:47.180
- In what way?
- Someone tried to kill her last night.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.710
No.

39:50.760 --> 39:54.720
No, no, no. I'm all for protest
but... peaceful protest.

39:56.400 --> 39:58.790
- Is she all right?
- She's all right, sir, yes.

39:58.840 --> 40:00.590
More by luck than anything else.

40:00.640 --> 40:03.750
But the Reverend Golightly
was found dead this morning.

40:03.800 --> 40:06.140
It appears he's been poisoned.

40:06.440 --> 40:08.240
You can't think...

40:11.160 --> 40:14.150
It was nothing to do
with me. I swear to God.

40:14.200 --> 40:16.910
Yes, sir. There's a lot of
that going about at the minute.

40:16.960 --> 40:19.990
However, I think we might get
a formal statement from you,

40:20.040 --> 40:23.740
under caution down the
station, if you'd come with us.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.910
Bettina? Are you coming?

40:31.960 --> 40:33.830
In a minute, Mummy.

40:40.920 --> 40:44.190
- Likely suspect this Jessop character?
- Gotta be favourite, sir.

40:44.240 --> 40:48.470
He hates Mrs Pettybon with a passion.
They clashed live on television last night.

40:48.520 --> 40:51.150
You're assuming she was
the intended victim.

40:51.200 --> 40:53.710
For now, yes. We've no
reason to think anything else.

40:53.760 --> 40:56.110
What do we know about Reverend Golightly?

40:56.160 --> 41:00.830
Well, no family, ordained before the
war, ministered all over the country.

41:00.880 --> 41:02.790
Any connection with Oxford?

41:02.840 --> 41:05.710
Brief spell as vicar of
Saint Mary's ten years ago.

41:05.760 --> 41:07.350
Saint Mary's?

41:07.400 --> 41:11.100
Barry Finch was a choirboy
there, until his voice went.

41:14.800 --> 41:17.470
Looking at the mark on Finch's body,

41:17.600 --> 41:21.160
If you were to rotate it, it
could be a cross, couldn't it?

41:25.360 --> 41:28.360
- Two glasses!
- Please, Mummy. Nothing happened.

41:29.760 --> 41:32.710
- We just talked.
- You expect me to believe that?

41:32.760 --> 41:36.440
I know what goes on in
bedrooms between men and women.

41:37.560 --> 41:39.270
Mummy! Mummy, please! Don't!

41:39.320 --> 41:41.070
It's for your own good, Bettina.

41:41.120 --> 41:42.860
You're not kind.

41:43.520 --> 41:45.510
You're wicked.

41:45.560 --> 41:47.390
And godless.

41:47.440 --> 41:49.440
No wonder Daddy did...

41:52.040 --> 41:54.840
'Oxford Police Station. How may I help?

41:55.600 --> 41:57.430
Hello? Hello?'

41:57.480 --> 42:00.110
Would you put me through to
the Chief Constable, please?

42:00.160 --> 42:04.060
- 'Yes. Who's calling, please?'
- It's Mrs Pettybon, dear.

42:05.240 --> 42:08.280
Clear your mind of all things.

42:09.880 --> 42:13.510
Let go of all earthly attachments.

42:13.560 --> 42:17.520
Become a leaf on a river.

42:19.320 --> 42:24.030
You are drifting downstream...
towards nothingness.

42:24.080 --> 42:29.280
It may feel like death,
but... it is not dying.

42:44.960 --> 42:46.160
Yes?

42:51.640 --> 42:54.470
- Sir? - I've just got off
the telephone from Division.

42:54.520 --> 42:59.440
It seems the Chief Constable is a
great admirer of Mrs Pettybon's work.

43:02.160 --> 43:05.150
- She has a daughter. Bettina, is it?
- Yes, sir.

43:05.200 --> 43:07.030
Timid little thing.

43:07.080 --> 43:10.470
Yes, well, Mrs Pettybon's
of the impression

43:10.520 --> 43:15.920
Morse may have overstepped the
mark somewhat in that regard.

43:17.760 --> 43:20.830
Nonsense, I'm sure, but the
Chief Constable wants him removed

43:20.880 --> 43:24.720
from any further involvement
in the Golightly case.

43:27.800 --> 43:31.670
Yes. She asked me in to open
the window. It had stuck.

43:31.720 --> 43:35.240
So, you just opened her
window and went on your way.

43:39.440 --> 43:41.590
What?

43:41.640 --> 43:43.470
Well, we had a drink.

43:43.520 --> 43:45.750
In the bar?

43:45.800 --> 43:48.830
She had a bottle. I was
there for half an hour.

43:48.880 --> 43:52.110
- 45 minutes at most.
- You shouldn't have been there at all!

43:52.160 --> 43:54.710
Now you've been added a black
spot straight from the top!

43:54.760 --> 43:58.560
Where do you think that leaves me? Mr
Bright wants you off the Golightly case!

44:01.680 --> 44:04.310
You'd better turn your brain
back onto Barry Finch.

44:04.360 --> 44:06.590
Get a result, you'll be
in Bright's good books.

44:06.640 --> 44:09.070
- He has your best interests at heart.
- Hides it well.

44:09.120 --> 44:12.680
That's because he's a lot smarter
than you give him credit for.

44:23.480 --> 44:27.240
Why don't you lay off that?
Keep a clear head for a bit?

44:36.320 --> 44:38.860
Look, it's all gonna be all right.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.320
Is it?

44:49.680 --> 44:51.820
You're my little brother.

44:52.400 --> 44:55.070
I'd never let anything happen to you.

45:15.720 --> 45:17.830
What's this? Are you
joining the "in" crowd?

45:17.880 --> 45:20.510
I think I know all I need
to know about The Wildwood.

45:20.560 --> 45:21.870
Listen to this.

45:21.920 --> 45:25.230
"Christopher will come up with a
bass riff that really fires me up.

45:25.280 --> 45:28.350
We all contribute to the arrangements,
but he sometimes has an idea

45:28.400 --> 45:30.550
that totally transforms a song."

45:30.600 --> 45:32.230
Drivel.

45:32.280 --> 45:37.390
It can't be that awful. They're comparing
Nick's lyrics to James Joyce and Oscar Wilde.

45:37.440 --> 45:39.510
- Who are?
- The critics.

45:39.560 --> 45:43.270
- Full of symbolism and allusion, apparently.
- Full of something.

45:43.320 --> 45:46.230
I read that they nearly called
themselves The Toadstools.

45:46.280 --> 45:49.870
That's right. In honour of the mushrooming
trips Nick and Christopher went on.

45:49.920 --> 45:53.270
If it was their band originally, then
were did the other brother fit in?

45:53.320 --> 45:55.310
Ken was the better guitarist.

45:55.360 --> 45:58.790
Seems to have muscled his
way in and taken control.

45:58.840 --> 46:03.280
Christopher's become a bit of a spare
wheel. But that's show business.

46:20.640 --> 46:23.120
- Car trouble?
- Not quite.

46:27.880 --> 46:29.230
Not a cross, then?

46:29.280 --> 46:32.350
- Where did you get that idea?
- Something Trewlove said.

46:32.400 --> 46:35.800
He could have been moved by
car, couldn't he? Laid face down.

46:37.360 --> 46:40.760
The wheel brace could have
caused that mark, then?

46:49.200 --> 46:52.470
The primary cause of
Reverend Golightly's death

46:52.520 --> 46:55.230
was haemorrhage leading to heart failure.

46:55.280 --> 46:57.190
Natural causes?

46:57.240 --> 46:59.430
I don't think I said that, did I?

46:59.480 --> 47:02.550
- So, what caused it?
- Laxative.

47:02.600 --> 47:05.590
The Reverend Golightly's
kidneys were all but shot.

47:05.640 --> 47:08.870
Magnesium in the laxative
caused hypomagnesaemia --

47:08.920 --> 47:12.670
respiratory distress, low
blood pressure, arrhythmia...

47:12.720 --> 47:16.070
- That would explain the blood, would it?
- It would explain the vomiting.

47:16.120 --> 47:21.110
However, he was also suffering from
an undiagnosed aortic aneurysm.

47:21.160 --> 47:26.070
The rest of it put such a strain on his
system that it ruptured. Hence the blood.

47:26.120 --> 47:28.830
Puked his guts up, then. Literally.

47:28.880 --> 47:31.910
What a lyrical child you
must have been, Sergeant!

47:31.960 --> 47:35.830
- Shouldn't have been fatal, though.
- Not ordinarily, no.

47:35.880 --> 47:38.750
Certainly not to anyone in decent health.

51:19.620 --> 51:22.250
Oh. Hello again. Everything all right?

51:22.300 --> 51:24.850
- I thought you were done with us.
- No, not quite.

51:24.900 --> 51:27.570
- I'm looking for Mr Spender and the group.
- Gone to London.

51:27.620 --> 51:30.890
For a photo session. I think
some radio thing later.

51:30.940 --> 51:33.650
- Nick's here. - Why didn't he
go with the rest of the group?

51:33.700 --> 51:36.690
- Don't think he felt up to it.
- Well, where will I find him?

51:36.740 --> 51:41.650
It's a secret. In his thinking spot.
He goes there to work on songs.

51:41.700 --> 51:45.970
Well, I really would like to talk to
him. If you could tell me where that is.

51:46.020 --> 51:48.570
- You won't find it.
- Why not?

51:48.620 --> 51:50.890
Cos it's an enchanted place.

51:51.820 --> 51:54.090
I can show you, if you like.

51:56.180 --> 51:59.290
So you said you've been with the
group a couple of months. That right?

51:59.340 --> 52:03.580
- Band. Nick prefers "band"
to "group". - Does he?

52:05.180 --> 52:06.850
How was it you came to be with them?

52:06.900 --> 52:08.570
Just did.

52:08.620 --> 52:12.410
Pippa and me went backstage after a
concert they did and got talking to them,

52:12.460 --> 52:14.930
and just... stayed on, I suppose.

52:16.380 --> 52:19.120
- Do you like it?
- Oh, it's a scene.

52:20.900 --> 52:24.770
- Shall I tell you something?
- If you like.

52:24.820 --> 52:26.930
You know Jennifer Sometimes?

52:26.980 --> 52:28.810
That's about me.

52:28.860 --> 52:31.960
Nick wrote it about me.
He put my name in it.

52:32.340 --> 52:34.530
- I thought your name was Emma?
- It is.

52:34.580 --> 52:36.770
Emma Jennifer d'Arblay Carr.

52:36.820 --> 52:38.890
But he just used the Jennifer bit.

52:38.940 --> 52:40.490
There you are.

52:40.540 --> 52:44.050
It's over there.

52:44.100 --> 52:46.610
- You not coming with?
- No. It's his enchanted place.

52:46.660 --> 52:48.210
We're not allowed.

52:48.260 --> 52:49.860
Bye.

53:24.340 --> 53:26.480
Would you like some wine?

53:27.260 --> 53:28.930
No. Thank you.

53:29.580 --> 53:32.180
"One should always be drunk."

53:34.220 --> 53:37.340
- I think there's something in
that, don't you? - Possibly.

53:39.860 --> 53:42.410
So this is your enchanted place, is it?

53:42.460 --> 53:44.050
That's right.

53:44.100 --> 53:46.900
- Did Barry Finch ever come here? - No.

53:49.700 --> 53:52.940
- What did you make of him?
- I don't want to talk about it.

53:55.380 --> 53:59.380
Nevertheless, it's my job
to find out how he died.

54:00.860 --> 54:02.930
I can't figure you out.

54:03.260 --> 54:06.890
What's to figure? I'm just a policeman.

54:06.940 --> 54:11.290
Yeah, but you know that there's
something happening, right? Here.

54:11.340 --> 54:13.650
In the world. Everywhere.

54:13.700 --> 54:16.300
People our age looking for answers.

54:17.420 --> 54:20.020
But you are in a suit.

54:21.460 --> 54:24.740
- I'm happy in a suit.
- Don't you wanna expand your mind?

54:26.140 --> 54:27.880
You read Huxley?

54:29.380 --> 54:32.050
I want to see what's beyond the door.

54:32.980 --> 54:34.930
There's something else.

54:34.980 --> 54:37.520
You just gotta find the right key.

54:37.780 --> 54:39.530
- Drugs?
- Nothing heavy.

54:39.580 --> 54:41.370
Meditation.

54:41.420 --> 54:43.690
Mushrooms.

54:43.740 --> 54:46.930
Me and Chris used to look
for mushrooms after school.

54:46.980 --> 54:50.340
- You ever tried 'em?
- Only as part of an English breakfast.

54:51.780 --> 54:55.700
So what do you expect to
find... beyond the door?

54:57.380 --> 54:59.810
The infinite.

54:59.860 --> 55:01.800
Infinite possibility.

55:02.780 --> 55:04.540
Infinite love.

55:05.180 --> 55:08.180
We're all just angels
that fell from grace.

55:09.980 --> 55:14.690
Every one of us. There
is no shame. No guilt.

55:14.740 --> 55:19.180
Everyone vibrating at the
same frequency as the universe.

55:20.940 --> 55:25.240
- If something happened with Barry Finch...
- Nothing happened!

55:26.340 --> 55:27.740
He left.

55:28.740 --> 55:31.660
He left... and he died.

55:33.420 --> 55:35.540
- They took him.
- Who?

55:38.340 --> 55:39.780
The gods.

55:52.980 --> 55:56.880
Forensics have come back on
that letter Mrs Pettybon got.

55:56.980 --> 56:00.210
No prints beside hers, her
daughter's and Reverend Golightly's.

56:00.260 --> 56:02.930
Oh, and yours, Mr Bright's and Morse's.

56:02.980 --> 56:05.570
Must have worn gloves,
then, whoever sent it.

56:05.620 --> 56:07.290
Looks like it.

56:09.460 --> 56:11.690
- What about the envelope?
- Sir?

56:11.740 --> 56:13.730
Did they check the envelope?

56:13.780 --> 56:15.490
Well, it'll be covered in prints.

56:15.540 --> 56:18.690
Been through the GPO, the
collector, the sorter, the postman.

56:18.740 --> 56:22.540
- They'll have had their dabs
all over it. - Not inside.

56:23.100 --> 56:24.440
Inside.

56:26.700 --> 56:28.440
And, Sergeant...

56:29.380 --> 56:31.050
One more thing.

56:38.980 --> 56:41.170
Mrs Clark? I'll be on my way now.

56:41.220 --> 56:43.930
Actually, I did want to
see you about something.

56:43.980 --> 56:48.020
- Would you put something on, please?
- Does nakedness make you uncomfortable?

56:54.260 --> 56:56.970
- Drink?
- No, thank you, Mrs Clark.

56:57.020 --> 57:00.290
- Can't you call me Anna-Britt?
- I think it's better we keep it formal.

57:00.340 --> 57:02.300
English. So uptight.

57:03.500 --> 57:07.810
- What was it you wanted to see me about?
- That boy. The builder.

57:07.860 --> 57:09.930
Oh, yes? What about him?

57:16.540 --> 57:18.140
Morse?

57:18.820 --> 57:21.690
- Hello. What's this?
- The station said I'd find you here.

57:21.740 --> 57:26.010
- I've just come from Maplewick Hall...
- Oh... Morse, hello.

57:26.060 --> 57:29.730
You've a nerve! What's he doing here?

57:29.780 --> 57:33.370
Detective Constable Morse is here
on other business, Mrs Pettybon.

57:33.420 --> 57:35.450
I told the Chief Constable
I don't want him.

57:35.500 --> 57:36.810
Perhaps you didn't hear.

57:36.860 --> 57:38.810
I'm here about another matter.

57:38.860 --> 57:41.930
- All right, matey.
- And I can imagine what.

57:41.980 --> 57:45.880
- Go to your room, Bettina.
- Mummy... - Go to your room!

57:50.260 --> 57:51.580
So...

57:52.900 --> 57:56.090
I hope you've come to tell
me you've arrested him.

57:56.140 --> 57:58.090
- Arrested who?
- Dudley Jessop.

57:58.140 --> 58:00.250
He's an abomination in
the eyes of our Lord.

58:00.300 --> 58:03.410
The Police Training Manual
omits to mention abominations.

58:03.460 --> 58:07.530
Yes. Well, thankfully,
Inspector Thursday and I

58:07.580 --> 58:10.090
can remember a time
when people were decent.

58:10.140 --> 58:13.330
Actually, Mrs Pettybon, I'm here
to talk about this letter of yours,

58:13.380 --> 58:16.010
the one threatening your life.

58:16.060 --> 58:17.410
Oh, yes?

58:17.460 --> 58:19.930
- Strange?
- We had it examined.

58:20.380 --> 58:21.850
For fingerprints.

58:21.900 --> 58:25.170
We found yours on there, and
your daughter's, and Golightly's.

58:25.220 --> 58:27.530
You would. I showed it to them.

58:27.580 --> 58:30.570
We also found a print of your
second, third and fourth finger

58:30.620 --> 58:33.330
on the inside of the
envelope. On the sealed flap.

58:33.380 --> 58:35.930
Yes, well, I would have done
that taking the letter out.

58:35.980 --> 58:40.250
Unlikely. You see, most
of us remove a letter

58:40.300 --> 58:44.020
with our fingernails facing
inside the envelope, like so.

58:44.780 --> 58:49.610
Well... it's unlikely, but it isn't
impossible. I handled it a lot.

58:49.660 --> 58:51.810
Yes, I thought about that.

58:51.860 --> 58:55.210
However, there is one place where it
would have been impossible for you

58:55.260 --> 58:57.460
to leave your thumb print.

58:58.820 --> 59:00.560
Under the stamp.

59:02.140 --> 59:06.410
We had to lift it off very carefully,
but there's one small part of that stamp

59:06.460 --> 59:09.490
where the adhesive didn't quite take.

59:09.540 --> 59:15.540
And that's where we found a good
partial print... of your right thumb.

59:16.780 --> 59:18.890
You see, that would be impossible.

59:18.940 --> 59:21.810
How could your fingerprint be
underneath a stamp on a letter

59:21.860 --> 59:24.460
sent to you by a complete stranger?

59:24.620 --> 59:26.450
I'll tell you what I think, shall I?

59:26.500 --> 59:29.370
I think you posted that letter to yourself

59:29.420 --> 59:33.650
in an effort to gain sympathy for
your cause and drum up trade.

59:33.700 --> 59:35.530
You can't prove that.

59:35.580 --> 59:38.530
Oh, I expect we can,

59:38.580 --> 59:41.050
if we really put our mind to it.

59:42.500 --> 59:44.370
So let me get this straight.

59:44.420 --> 59:48.090
Christopher Clark's wife heard
a car pulling out of Maplewick

59:48.140 --> 59:51.440
in the early hours on the
night Barry Finch died.

59:51.940 --> 59:54.690
A neighbour heard a car
outside the pub yard.

59:54.740 --> 59:57.690
Maybe it was Spender who
dumped his body there.

59:57.740 --> 01:00:00.970
Mr Spender said he was in London,
didn't he? His flat in Mount Street.

01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:03.650
Talking to America. You press him on that?

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:06.730
No. He's with the band, apart
from Nick, at a recording session.

01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:09.330
- You think he's on the level?
- Nick?

01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:12.690
I think something's going on
between him, Emma and Pippa.

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:14.740
He's hiding something.

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:13.170
Morse.

01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:14.740
Nick!

01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:17.480
- Nick?
- Nick!

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:21.090
- Nick? - Nick? - Nick?

01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:23.890
- Nick?
- Come on, where are you?

01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:27.020
Nick? Nick?

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:35.660
Let's go, lads. Sarge's orders.

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:53.460
Thanks.

01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:57.400
This is where he was earlier.

01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:11.060
- Anything?
- No.

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:28.040
What the hell's that?

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:35.960
Somewhere over there.

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:04.820
There. There he is.

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:33.850
- Nick?
- Nick?

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:35.620
Nick?

01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:40.530
- Nick?
- Nick, it's me, it's me.

01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:43.090
- Nick, mate!
- What's up, man?

01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:45.210
Stand back a little.
Stand back. Stand back.

01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:48.370
- Just give him some space.
- Get the torch on him.

01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:50.610
Nick?... Nick?

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.290
Just give him some space.

01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:55.010
- Aaaah!
- It's all right. It's OK.

01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:58.010
- Get off me!
- All right...

01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:01.500
- What have you done to him?
- It's all right. I've got him. Nick?

01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:09.260
There we go.

01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:16.020
It's all right now. I'm just going to...
shine a little light in your eyes.

01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:19.290
- It's not going to hurt.
- What's the matter with him?

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:21.930
- He's my brother! Do something!
- Hey, hey. Look at me.

01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:24.010
He's high, man. He's just high.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.810
You need to stay cool.

01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:28.490
He's OK. He's just on a trip
and he's gonna come back down.

01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:31.450
That's not mushrooms. He
wouldn't do any chemicals!

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.330
Which one of you bastards dosed him?

01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:36.810
The main thing he needs
is a calm environment,

01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:39.210
a quiet, dark room, and
someone to stay with him.

01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:40.930
- I'll stay with him.
- I'll do it.

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:42.290
- Ken!
- You've done enough.

01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:44.250
I left him and he was fine,

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:46.890
and I come back and he's
gone half out of his mind.

01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:48.970
- So just stay away!
- I didn't do anything!

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:51.930
- We'll make sure he's looked after, Ken.
- You'll do nothing.

01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:55.340
The only people allowed anywhere near
him are me, Chris and Lee, all right?

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:58.370
- We'll do it in shifts.
- You got it, man.

01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:00.330
Anything, Ken. All right?

01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:04.290
- What's your role in
this, Dr Bakshi? - My role?

01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:08.890
I was engaged by Mr Spender as
personal physician to the group.

01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:10.330
What does that entail?

01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:13.250
Why would a bunch of fit young
men need a personal doctor?

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:16.900
Oh, you'd be surprised.
Sprains. Nervous exhaustion.

01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.650
A group on the road needs to
be kept in tiptop condition.

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:25.010
How do you go about that?
Pills, is it? Uppers? Downers?

01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:27.060
Nothing illegal.

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:31.730
But, yes, the occasional
sleeping draught. Odd booster.

01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:35.010
- So what's he taken here?
- Nothing of mine.

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:39.660
My diagnosis is, he has been given a
large dose of lysergic acid diethylamide.

01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:43.980
- And will he recover?
- Oh, his body, yes. But his mind?

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:47.840
It really depends on the size of the dose.

01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:57.620
Mr Spender, a few questions, please.

01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:08.740
Have you any idea where Nick
might have come by this LSD?

01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:14.460
They smoke a little pot, all right?

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:19.810
Mushrooms, maybe, but that's it,
that's as far as it goes. Nothing heavy.

01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:24.490
Dr Bakshi said he might not fully
recover -- his wits at any rate.

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:27.210
It's gonna hit any revenue
you were hoping to make.

01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:29.330
God, it's not about the money.

01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:32.010
Not for me. It's been the music.

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:34.570
Always. From the second I saw them.

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:38.930
- What about infighting within the group?
- Someone dosed him? No. No. I...

01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:41.530
They fight, but they're family.
Nobody would hurt Nick.

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:44.330
OK, then, what about
somebody outside the group?

01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:47.570
- One of the girls, maybe?
- No. Everybody loves Nicky.

01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:52.090
Mrs Clark said she heard a car pull up
outside the house in the early hours

01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:54.130
on the day we found Barry Finch.

01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:57.180
- Anna-Britt's just stirring.
- Why would she do that?

01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:01.570
She thinks I did Chris out of some
credit on one of the boys' songs

01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:03.610
He Loves You, their first 45.

01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:05.460
- Did you?
- No.

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:09.210
Chris was just playing around with
chord changes in rehearsal one day.

01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:12.530
It fired something up in Nicky, he comes
in the next day with He Loves You.

01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:16.570
Anna-Britt thinks Chris needs credit
for that. But copyright is very clear.

01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:19.690
So you didn't come back
from London the other night?

01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:21.210
I've told you.

01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:25.010
I was in my flat in Mount
Street on the phone to America.

01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:28.210
Well, then, you'll have no
objection to us examining your car.

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:30.460
What for?

01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:40.340
Help yourself. I've got nothing to hide.

01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:42.640
Well...

01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:45.770
.. I'd say that's a perfect match.

01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:48.170
Tough to make it stick on that alone.

01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:51.520
Half the cars in Oxford
must carry a wheel brace.

01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:54.090
Could LSD have stopped his heart?

01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:55.930
Well, it's possible.

01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:58.330
Overstimulation of the nervous system.

01:07:58.380 --> 01:07:59.770
Rare.

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:01.810
But it could have done.

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:03.210
What's it do?

01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:07.450
It produces extreme visual
and auditory hallucinations.

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:11.250
Not usually toxic chemically,
but behaviourally.

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:13.770
- In what way?
- Loss of inhibition.

01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:15.730
Compromised rationality.

01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:18.810
Most deaths involving the
substance are accidental --

01:08:18.859 --> 01:08:21.410
walking into traffic, onto railway lines,

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:23.800
stepping off high buildings...

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:28.779
I'll talk to the lab. Easier to find something
if you know what you're looking for.

01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:33.729
If it does come back positive,
that makes it three.

01:08:33.779 --> 01:08:36.850
Barry Finch, Reverend
Golightly and now Nick Wilding.

01:08:36.899 --> 01:08:39.850
All poisoned, one way or
another, drugged leastways.

01:08:39.899 --> 01:08:43.810
- Except Nick Wilding's not dead.
- More by luck than judgment, maybe.

01:08:43.859 --> 01:08:46.970
Maybe. Or perhaps it was just
an attempt to shut him up.

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:49.700
- About what?
- Barry Finch.

01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:25.210
Progress on Golightly?

01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:30.529
Mrs Pettybon may have sent the
threatening letter to herself,

01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:35.569
but our favourite for dosing the chocolates
is still this magazine editor, sir.

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:38.560
Yes, well, a lot of hate about altogether.

01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:41.810
More than there used to be, do you think?

01:09:41.859 --> 01:09:43.250
Oh, I wouldn't know, sir.

01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:47.250
- Television, perhaps?
- That would certainly be Mrs Pettybon's angle.

01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:49.770
Two world wars. Millions dead.

01:09:49.819 --> 01:09:52.290
Atrocities. The camps. The bomb.

01:09:52.819 --> 01:09:56.170
She'd be hard put to lay that
at the door of television.

01:09:56.220 --> 01:10:00.010
Always been hate, sir. Right
back to Cain and Abel.

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:05.180
Just as well, I suppose. Else we'd
have to find ourselves a proper job.

01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:32.700
Nothing happened!

01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:35.770
He left.

01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:38.980
He left... and died!

01:10:56.820 --> 01:11:00.170
- So Finch was part of some sort of orgy?
- All right for some.

01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:03.210
I could never get a seat at
musical chairs, never mind that.

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:07.250
- You wouldn't like it, not with your back.
- It's Barry Finch's watch.

01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:10.050
She was spreading her
favours, then, this Pippa girl?

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:12.490
- Where did you find it?
- In a Turkish Delight box

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:15.970
- Nick Wilding kept in his den.
- Maybe he kept it for his own entertainment.

01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:17.650
It could be blackmail, couldn't it?

01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:20.570
It wouldn't do much for their
image if this got into the papers.

01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:24.330
- Almost expected of pop stars these days, sir.
- I don't know so much, sir.

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:27.570
- All right, Constable.
- No, no. Go on, Constable Trewlove.

01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:29.970
Well, sir, the public
can be pretty fickle.

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:33.010
Something like this could bring
the whole house of cards down.

01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:37.890
No. Well, Spender has too much investment
in those lads to let that happen.

01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:40.690
The bigger point is, who
took the picture and why?

01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:43.650
Keep at it. There's a few things
I want to put to Mrs Pettybon.

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:45.570
- What's this?
- The Golightly case, sir.

01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:48.050
- Strange? - I've had a dig
into Mrs Pettybon, sir.

01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:50.450
Nothing for her, but we've
a match on her husband.

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:53.090
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Suicide.

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:56.770
Daughter got back from Sunday Evensong
to find him hanging from the bannister.

01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:59.370
He'd been pinched for gross
indecency on the Friday

01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:02.220
and was looking at court on the Monday.

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:08.770
Well, I suppose you must be feeling
very pleased with yourself.

01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:10.330
Not particularly.

01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:13.890
But it certainly explains your vicious
hatred of men like Dudley Jessop.

01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:16.020
I loved my husband.

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:18.450
The man I thought he was.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:22.260
To lose him, it was a terrible shock.

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:26.410
But to find out that he'd
been carrying on like that...

01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:28.530
But you drove him to it!

01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:33.680
- I heard you.
- It was what he deserved.

01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:40.130
- Better that than bringing shame on the family.
- You bitch! You utter bitch!

01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:43.480
- All right. All right. All right.
- Get off me!

01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:47.660
I'm leaving.

01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:51.580
You can rot in hell for all I care.

01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:59.090
She'll be back.

01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:00.460
No.

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:03.260
She won't.

01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:15.330
What do you think happened?

01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:19.610
I think Barry Finch died at Maplewick Hall
and Ralph Spender came back and tidied up.

01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:22.290
Then moved Finch's body to the pub yard.

01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:26.370
- So why haven't you arrested him?
- Because so far his alibi stands up.

01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:28.450
That he was in London,
on the phone to the USA,

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:30.930
planning a tour with the erm...

01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:34.330
- .. Kinks?
- The Kinks? He can't have.

01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:37.010
- Why not?
- The Kinks are banned from America.

01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:39.860
It's something to do with work permits.

01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:41.700
Really?

01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:55.400
I'll be up at Maplewick
Hall if anyone wants me.

01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:27.860
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:31.860
I'm looking for Mr Spender.

01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:34.820
Erm, he's not here.

01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:38.130
The boys have taken Nick to
see a specialist in Surrey.

01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:41.650
Major Ralph and Bruno have
taken them. Pippa's gone too.

01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:49.280
- Do you want a drink?
- Oh. Yes, please.

01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:01.330
What about Christopher's wife?

01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:02.930
Anna-Britt?

01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:06.410
I think they were dropping her off
at Chris's mother's, with the baby.

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:07.850
It's in town somewhere.

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:10.010
You were seen, Mr Jessop,

01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:12.370
mooching around backstage
at the Almanac show.

01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:16.260
You had the perfect opportunity to
leave those poisoned chocolates.

01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:18.900
Who told you that?

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:21.730
- The girl, I presume?
- What girl?

01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:24.780
How were things between
Anna-Britt and Nick?

01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:27.660
How do you mean?

01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:31.330
Nick and Chris were good
friends, weren't they?

01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:35.180
They went to school together. I just
wondered if there was any jealousy.

01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:38.820
I couldn't say. Why?

01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:44.140
Oh... Just curious.

01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:47.170
There was a young woman
in her dressing room.

01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:50.160
She said she was Mrs Pettybon's assistant.

01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:53.370
She asked me what I was doing there.

01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:56.010
I said I was lost, and went on my way.

01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:58.530
The daughter, you mean? Bettina?

01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:01.700
No. No, I know what she looks like.

01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:03.890
Poor creature.

01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:06.410
This girl, can you describe her?

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:11.340
- Would you mind if I looked
in Nick's room? - Sure.

01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:14.730
The poisoned chocolates
were for Mrs Pettybon.

01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:17.810
She threatened to have the group's
record banned on television.

01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:19.530
Could Spender have put her up to it?

01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:21.410
It could have damaged the group's sales.

01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:24.050
Even he wouldn't go that far.
He was trying to buy her off.

01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:27.380
No, this is good old-fashioned
hate, pure and simple.

01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:29.810
Where's Morse?

01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:40.240
What is it you're looking for? Can I help?

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:46.650
Pippa was sleeping with
Nick. Is that right?

01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:49.370
Yes. On and off.

01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:51.610
And Barry Finch.

01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:53.330
What about him?

01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:57.880
Was she sleeping with him too?

01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:03.240
I'd better get that.

01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:37.770
Maplewick Hall.

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:40.530
This is Detective Inspector
Thursday, Oxford City Police.

01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:42.370
- Who am I speaking to?
- Hello?

01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:45.050
I believe you have Detective
Constable Morse with you.

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:47.710
I'd like to speak to him now, please.

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:50.180
Hello?... Hello?

01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:53.890
You're a keen photographer?

01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:55.930
It's my thing.

01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:59.340
Ralph says we might do a
book -- pictures of the band.

01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:02.980
So did you take this?

01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:08.360
That's Nick, Pippa and
Barry Finch, isn't it?

01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:11.480
Did they know you'd taken it?

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:15.930
- No, I suppose not. They're asleep.
- Nick asked me to.

01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:18.210
I don't think so. No.

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:19.890
I think this was private.

01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:24.730
I doubt anyone knew, except those
involved and you, of course.

01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:27.610
- Only, you weren't invited.
- Anyone knew what?

01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:30.210
That Nick was sleeping
with Pippa and Barry.

01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:32.530
It's there in the title
of their new album.

01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:34.450
Boys & Girls Come Out To Play.

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.170
Boys AND girls.

01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:39.050
There's also a message
on the groove of their LP.

01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:41.570
YEMKTTHL 4099.

01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:45.290
- That's... It's just a matrix number.
- "Yet each man kills the thing he loves."

01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:49.900
4099. The prisoner number assigned to Oscar
Wilde when he was sent to Reading Gaol.

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:53.690
I think you couldn't stand that
Nick was sleeping with Barry Finch.

01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:57.140
You waited until he passed
out, and strangled him.

01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:06.050
Nick must've come to, his mind
still clouded by drink and drugs,

01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:08.130
found Barry dead beside him.

01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:11.980
He couldn't be sure that his
sex game hadn't gone wrong.

01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:13.770
What sex game?

01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:16.890
In Justine, de Sade's book, one
character has another hang him

01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:20.580
to the point of unconsciousness. I think
Nick experimented with the same idea.

01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:34.890
The thing is, all you had
to do that night was wait.

01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:36.330
What?

01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:39.330
By the time you strangled Barry
Finch, he was already dying.

01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:42.530
He'd had a bad reaction
to the drugs he'd taken.

01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:45.410
But that wasn't it. You thought,
with Barry out of the way,

01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:47.770
Nick might be yours. But
he never would have been.

01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:51.210
- That's why you slipped him the LSD.
- Why would I hurt Nick?

01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:52.970
I love him!

01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:55.810
He loves me! I know he does!

01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:57.610
He wrote Jennifer Sometimes for me!

01:19:57.660 --> 01:20:00.650
- No, he didn't. That's not about you.
- It is! He told me!

01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:02.300
No, it's not.

01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:06.570
"Go back to the old school.
Look under the toadstool."

01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:08.960
The lyrics don't apply to you.

01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:13.060
But they do apply to Christopher
Clark. It's "Christopher Sometimes".

01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:16.760
But he could hardly put that on the radio.

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.180
It's my name.

01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:25.930
If it wasn't for me, why
would he call it Jennifer?

01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:28.050
To make scansion.

01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:31.620
Christopher, Jennifer.
Same amount of syllables.

01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:36.380
Something wrong?

01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:40.160
Something wrong?

01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:04.100
It's all right. It's all right.

01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:08.370
You have nothing to be afraid of.

01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:09.890
Unless you have.

01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:13.250
What you take in with you
is what you find in there.

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:17.420
You must have seen some terrible
things. It's all waiting for you.

01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:32.210
What's in there, Morse?

01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:29.420
Morse! Morse!

01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:31.410
Morse.

01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:32.890
- All right!
- Get off me!

01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:35.590
What have you given him?
What've you given him?

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:37.700
Morse...

01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:43.060
All right, Morse. All right.

01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:55.320
Will he recover?

01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:58.480
Time will tell, sir.

01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:02.660
But he's been to hell and back.

01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:06.090
The only hope is, it
wasn't LSD she gave him.

01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:09.080
She used the last of that on Nick Wilding.

01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:12.210
And there doesn't look
to be much hope for him.

01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:14.330
So what did she use on Morse?

01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:21.170
A concoction of henbane,
mandrake and Jimson weed.

01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:24.210
Effects are not dissimilar to LSD.

01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:27.690
And it was she who sent the
chocolates to Mrs Pettybon?

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:28.890
Yes, sir.

01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:33.930
She wanted to get back at her for
trying to get the group's record banned.

01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:36.330
Only, they ended up
with Reverend Golightly.

01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:38.850
Girl sounds an absolute hellion.

01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:15.020
Morse.

01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:23.460
Morse.

01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:33.700
What day is it?

01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:37.100
Corned beef.

01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:44.800
It's Friday.

01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:49.500
It's Friday.

01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:53.490
That's right.

01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:55.460
Friday.

01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:01.100
Did she confess?

01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:06.810
- Emma?
- Oh, yeah.

01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:09.930
She planted the photos
in the Turkish Delight box

01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:13.660
after she'd doped Nick to discredit him.

01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:16.220
Well...

01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:20.050
I'd better let you get some rest.

01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:25.780
No need to rush back.

01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:28.540
In your own good time.

01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:32.740
Morse. Oxford 2947.

01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:35.410
'This is the operator.

01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:39.580
I have a reverse charge call from
Leamington. Will you accept the charges?'

01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:43.160
I don't think I know anyone in Leamington.

01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:45.820
Oh, yes. Yes.

01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:50.060
'Connecting you now. Go ahead, caller.'

01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:56.860
Hello?

01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:06.700
Miss Thursday?

01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:16.260
'I'm sorry, sir. She's disconnected.'
