and what I leave behind
is some of the pain

39:46.467 --> 39:48.733
that others
have inflicted on me.

39:51.300 --> 39:54.133
To all the parents
and their children.

39:57.100 --> 39:59.833
To those who have
laughed at me...

...turned their back on me.

40:04.200 --> 40:06.300
Kettering Hotel, Deb speaking.

40:07.233 --> 40:08.900
Yeah, she was just here.

40:08.933 --> 40:11.033
She's taken Matilda
to a concert.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.433
Why?

40:13.467 --> 40:16.100
RENAE: I don't want you
to look at me with pity.

40:18.300 --> 40:19.900
I want you to feel my pain.

40:19.933 --> 40:21.700
I just rang the organisers.

40:21.733 --> 40:23.300
There is no concert.

40:24.433 --> 40:25.667
I'll call it in.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
Deb, is there somewhere
we can talk?

40:32.033 --> 40:36.033
RENAE: Nobody knows what
it's like to lose a child.

40:36.067 --> 40:40.233
The desperate helplessness,
the aching loss.

40:41.500 --> 40:44.500
People look at you
like you're contagious

40:44.533 --> 40:48.000
with some horrible disease
they don't want to catch.

40:48.967 --> 40:50.533
But they don't really care.

40:52.567 --> 40:55.300
Now you'll know
what it feels like.

40:56.433 --> 40:59.100
Chloe had to pay the price
for you all.

41:00.533 --> 41:04.333
My precious Gillian
was taken from me.

41:04.367 --> 41:08.267
Perhaps it was punishment
for my sins,

41:08.300 --> 41:11.067
but who can say
they live without sin?

41:15.700 --> 41:17.233
ROY: Anna, it's me.

41:18.867 --> 41:21.600
Please call me as soon as
you get this message.

41:24.133 --> 41:26.067
I need to
talk to you urgently.

41:27.100 --> 41:29.067
I'm sorry I let you down.

41:34.067 --> 41:35.667
I need you to come home.

41:41.067 --> 41:42.167
Er...

41:44.833 --> 41:46.200
I love you.

41:53.933 --> 41:55.400
I'm sorry, Barb.

42:03.200 --> 42:05.200
-Hey, Macca.
-Good day, guys.
How are we?

42:10.500 --> 42:12.167
What the hell is that?

42:13.700 --> 42:15.333
What do you reckon that is?

42:16.267 --> 42:18.067
GRAYSON: Buggered if I know.

42:18.100 --> 42:19.933
(LOW HUMMING NOISE)

42:19.967 --> 42:21.733
And that bloody noise.

42:29.767 --> 42:32.633
Oh, Adam,
thank God you're here.
Where have you been?

42:34.933 --> 42:36.133
Where have you been?

42:38.400 --> 42:39.533

MAN ON RADIO:
One of our cars left
about five minutes ago.

42:48.233 --> 42:49.933
DUTCH: Yeah, great.

42:49.967 --> 42:53.300
There's a sighting of a car
matching Renae's
up near Bothwell.

42:55.300 --> 42:58.200
They got three cars
out there already.

42:58.233 --> 43:00.967
It's our job to wait here
in case Renae shows up.

43:01.067 --> 43:05.067
DUTCH: I think Renae
killed Chloe to
get back at Anna.

43:05.100 --> 43:08.300

bury their daughter
before we tell 'em, okay?

43:10.233 --> 43:11.133

43:11.167 --> 43:13.167
I'm going to go
and pay my respects.

43:22.600 --> 43:23.667
Oh shit.

43:25.700 --> 43:27.967
Why are you here?
Why aren't you
looking for her?

43:28.067 --> 43:29.933
Well, Deb, we've got
people looking for her.

43:29.967 --> 43:31.367
What's going on?

43:32.067 --> 43:33.400
Renae took her.

43:33.433 --> 43:35.533
-She took Matilda.
-Took her? Where?

43:35.567 --> 43:38.200
Barb, Max, we need to talk.
Let's go inside.

43:38.233 --> 43:39.933
Get your hands off my wife.

43:39.967 --> 43:41.533

43:41.567 --> 43:42.633

don't you?

43:53.900 --> 43:55.233
Fergus?

43:56.167 --> 43:57.567
MAX: Tell her.

43:59.800 --> 44:01.200
It was Renae.

44:02.600 --> 44:03.867
What?

of Chloe Holloway,

who has returned to her home,
with our Father in Heaven.

45:23.600 --> 45:27.900
The Lord is my Shepherd,
I shall not want.

45:27.933 --> 45:30.600
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

45:34.200 --> 45:36.633
He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

45:39.867 --> 45:42.167
He restoreth my soul.

45:44.900 --> 45:49.500
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness
for his namesake.

45:55.533 --> 46:00.433
Yea, though I walk
through the valley
of the shadow of death,

46:03.100 --> 46:04.767
I will fear no evil.

46:06.967 --> 46:09.833
For thou art with me.

Thy rod and thy staff
comfort me.

46:12.767 --> 46:13.767

46:19.067 --> 46:21.067
Thou preparest a table
before me

46:21.067 --> 46:23.333

46:28.067 --> 46:30.867
Thou anointest my head
with oil.

46:30.900 --> 46:32.233
My cup runneth over.

46:35.400 --> 46:41.567
Surely goodness and mercy
will follow me
all the days of my life.

of the Lord forever.
