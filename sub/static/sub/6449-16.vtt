[BELLINI'S "CASTA DIVA" PLAYING
ON STEREO]

34:47.835 --> 34:50.042
Enjoy the view one last time.

34:50.213 --> 34:53.922
Security's on their way up
to escort you out of the building.

34:55.593 --> 34:59.302
Now, if you're threatening me, you need
something more powerful than hot air.

34:59.514 --> 35:02.301
All the ﬁrepower I need is right here...

35:02.683 --> 35:05.516
...copies of all the documents
that bear your signature.

35:05.686 --> 35:08.018
No discrepancies.
Everything matches perfectly.

35:08.189 --> 35:10.555
My DNA, my handwriting...

35:10.733 --> 35:14.351
...identical to the other Lionel.

35:14.529 --> 35:16.520
Why would you have them
secretly reissued?

35:17.907 --> 35:21.570
You may think you scrubbed evidence
of your true identity from this world...

35:22.745 --> 35:24.656
...but you missed a spot.

35:24.831 --> 35:27.868
There was one document
that you were never aware of.

35:36.384 --> 35:38.375
When Lionel gave you up for adoption.

35:43.099 --> 35:46.091
I wasn't the only thing
that he left at the orphanage.

35:46.269 --> 35:49.136
He left his ﬁngerprints on a document
when he admitted me.

35:49.313 --> 35:51.975
And as you know, just like our worlds,
they're reversed.

35:53.317 --> 35:57.151
His ﬁngerprints and yours
are mirror copies of each other.

35:59.323 --> 36:01.314
It proves that you are a fake.

36:05.204 --> 36:06.865
My lawyers are drawing up papers...

36:07.081 --> 36:09.948
...that relinquish your complete control
of LuthorCorp to me.

36:12.295 --> 36:14.206
Why would I do that?

36:15.506 --> 36:18.339
Because of that Scotch
that you're drinking.

36:19.135 --> 36:21.296
-What?
-lt's laced with nano-trackers.

36:22.263 --> 36:25.471
They've burrowed deep into your stomach
lining and entered your bloodstream.

36:27.351 --> 36:30.343
From now on,
I will know your every move.

36:33.983 --> 36:38.727
And if you try to retaliate
against me or my friends...

36:39.280 --> 36:41.612
...I will crush you.

36:46.954 --> 36:49.366
Why don't you have me killed?

36:50.541 --> 36:51.781
Because that's not who I am.

37:40.299 --> 37:41.914
The barn never looked better.

37:42.093 --> 37:46.587
Well, it was the least I could do
to make up for all the trouble I caused.

37:46.764 --> 37:48.129
It's not your fault.

37:48.307 --> 37:52.516
If I hadn't lied to you, you wouldn't have
run right into Lionel's hands. I'm sorry.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.854
But I shouldn't have been so quick
to trust Lionel.

37:58.234 --> 38:01.567
Conner, you can't beat yourself up.
You had no idea...

38:01.737 --> 38:05.355
...that he would use Red Kryptonite
on you or how it would affect you.

38:08.577 --> 38:11.159
It's one of the drawbacks
of being like us.

38:11.330 --> 38:13.116
I'm not like you, Clark.

38:13.457 --> 38:16.369
I mean, maybe on the outside
with what I can do...

38:17.503 --> 38:20.961
...but what that ring brought out in me,
that was all Lex.

38:22.717 --> 38:25.504
There's a shadow inside of all of us.

38:26.262 --> 38:30.722
But that doesn't mean that you need to
embrace it. You decide who you are.

38:33.769 --> 38:37.387
I know you'll make the right choice
and become the hero you're destined to be.

38:38.274 --> 38:40.640
That means a lot coming from you.

38:42.611 --> 38:44.476
Well, if you feel that way...

38:44.655 --> 38:48.398
...maybe, uh, I should start
dressing the part.

38:53.622 --> 38:55.032
I know I have a lot to learn.

38:56.167 --> 39:00.126
But when you feel
that I'm ready to join the team...

39:00.296 --> 39:02.082

39:04.091 --> 39:08.209
Nice to hear you're ready to learn. I picked
up an application for you to Smallville High.

Guess I should start
with ﬁxing that fence out back.

39:35.831 --> 39:40.621
LOIS: It seems to me that Clark Kent's
nature and nurture won out in the end.

39:41.087 --> 39:44.796

not telling him the truth.

I'm sorry that I didn't tell you
I was investigating Lionel.

It put us both in danger,
even though I was trying to save you.

where to draw the line...

for my mom and dad.

I always knew that my powers
could cause harm if I misused them.

40:17.331 --> 40:21.119
But I never appreciated the responsibility
they must have felt in raising me.
