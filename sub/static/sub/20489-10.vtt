00:18.018 --> 00:20.820
You holding up okay?

00:21.221 --> 00:23.588
I'm fine.

00:23.623 --> 00:24.824
You know, i can
handle this my...

00:24.859 --> 00:26.426
i said i'm fine.

00:34.434 --> 00:37.237
If you think i'm letting you
handle explosives after that,

00:37.272 --> 00:39.239
you're hallucinating.

00:39.274 --> 00:41.241
Hand it over.

00:49.649 --> 00:51.251
Nice work, clark.

00:51.651 --> 00:52.852
First one
kills the building
security system.

00:53.253 --> 00:55.655
And the second one
destroys the database.

01:01.661 --> 01:04.063
That wire goes
to the second board.

01:08.868 --> 01:11.271
You try to get up
again and i'll kill you.

01:13.673 --> 01:16.476
The way i feel,
you may not have to.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.447
Now that i finally
caught up with you,

01:22.482 --> 01:24.484
mind telling me what
you think you're doing?

01:30.490 --> 01:32.492
Looks like we
got something in common.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.100
Clark, you gotta
trigger the second bomb.

02:39.359 --> 02:40.925
That was a big mistake.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.962
And now you have
really pissed me off.

02:49.769 --> 02:50.570
We've gotta pull out.

02:50.970 --> 02:51.971
The corporal's down.

02:52.006 --> 02:52.972
We've gotta go now.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.174
Right.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.180
Leave me.

03:00.580 --> 03:02.982
We all know i'm dying.

03:03.383 --> 03:04.949
Nobody gets left behind.

03:04.984 --> 03:06.586
We protect
our own at any cost.

04:24.063 --> 04:26.065
Oh, be quiet,
you big pussycat.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.267
Looks like a giant hickey.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.234
Yeah, well, trust me:

04:29.269 --> 04:30.870
It looks
like a lot more fun
than it actually was.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.273
What the hell were
you doing on your own?

04:33.673 --> 04:34.874
You could've called
me on the com-link.

04:34.909 --> 04:36.441
Oh, i'm sorry.

04:36.476 --> 04:38.878
I was too busy having
the life choked out of me.

04:38.913 --> 04:41.681
So they were ferals, huh?

04:41.716 --> 04:44.048
Yep.

04:44.083 --> 04:45.685
I was doing all right
with the first two 'til

04:45.720 --> 04:47.287
the human
mountain showed up.

04:47.687 --> 04:48.888
That big, huh?

04:49.289 --> 04:50.890
At least.

04:58.898 --> 05:01.301
You know,
emma was right.

05:01.701 --> 05:03.303
She picked
up a tele-empathic
transmission from

05:03.338 --> 05:04.869
a renegade
pack of new mutants.

05:04.904 --> 05:07.707
Renegades with a serious grudge
against tricorp botanicals, huh?

05:12.912 --> 05:14.313
No.

05:14.348 --> 05:15.632
No.

05:15.667 --> 05:16.692
Hey.

05:16.727 --> 05:17.717
Hey.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.321
Come up with an
answer for why these guys
have it in for tricorp?

05:21.356 --> 05:22.522
Not yet.

05:22.922 --> 05:23.723
No. Alright,
i got another question.

05:24.123 --> 05:25.290
Who are these guys?

05:25.325 --> 05:27.327
I mean, we've just gone through
the entire new mutant database.

05:27.362 --> 05:28.745
We can't find
anybody who matches

05:28.780 --> 05:30.255
the description
that you gave us.

05:30.290 --> 05:31.731
I don't know
what to tell you, adam.

05:32.131 --> 05:34.534
They were new mutants, and
the one who nailed me could've

05:34.934 --> 05:36.536
doubled for mount everest.

05:36.936 --> 05:38.538
All right, but are there
any other distinguishing

05:38.573 --> 05:40.104
characteristics?

05:40.139 --> 05:41.741
You mean aside
from the guy being
a seven-foot giant?

05:41.776 --> 05:43.308
Yeah.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.345
Well, the woman who took
me on, she was a professional.

05:45.380 --> 05:47.347
She had combat training.

05:47.382 --> 05:48.513
Huh.

05:48.548 --> 05:49.349
Military?

05:49.749 --> 05:50.915
Definitely.

05:50.950 --> 05:52.552
And she called
the wounded guy corporal.

05:52.587 --> 05:53.753
Any insignia
on their clothing?

05:53.788 --> 05:54.919
No.

05:54.954 --> 05:57.322
But they did have the
same tattoo on their wrist.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.759
A red disc with a black,
five-pointed star in the middle.

06:00.159 --> 06:02.126
Huh.

06:02.161 --> 06:05.365
Does it look
anything like this?

06:05.765 --> 06:07.732
That's it.

06:07.767 --> 06:11.771
Dark star: An international
antl-terrorist
unit fielded by interpol.

06:12.171 --> 06:14.974
Oh, yeah,
i know these bad boys.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.177
They make the navy seals
look like a saturday afternoon

06:18.212 --> 06:19.379
paintball club.

06:19.779 --> 06:20.980
Yeah, but look.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.348
Dark star doesn't
exist any more.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.185
According to this report,
they were all killed in a south

06:26.220 --> 06:28.953
american drug war
firefight two months ago.

06:28.988 --> 06:33.393
Okay, so we
gotta figure out how three
members of an elite combat

06:33.428 --> 06:35.760
unit,
listed as killed in action,

06:35.795 --> 06:38.998
suddenly turn up
with new mutant abilities.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.368
I'm concerned, dr. Harrison.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.606
This operation was supposed
to be tightly contained.

06:46.641 --> 06:48.973
I completely agree.

06:49.008 --> 06:52.211
But it seems
dark star refused
to lay down and die.

06:52.246 --> 06:54.979
Well,
nine of them seemed
to have complied.

06:55.014 --> 06:56.616
And i'm guessing
the three survivors
were responsible for the

06:56.651 --> 06:59.419
attack on
tricorp last night.

06:59.454 --> 07:01.386
Really?

07:01.421 --> 07:04.624
And your security branch
was able to drive them off.

07:05.024 --> 07:06.591
Security branch.

07:06.626 --> 07:09.028
My security team can
barely tie their shoelaces.

07:09.063 --> 07:12.196
We're in the agribusiness.

07:12.231 --> 07:15.435
Security has never been
a major issue - until now.

07:15.835 --> 07:17.802
Well,
welcome to my world.

07:17.837 --> 07:21.441
I'll assign my staff
to take over your security
effective immediately.

07:30.650 --> 07:33.453
Goodbye, corporal.

07:35.054 --> 07:38.257
I promise, i'll get those
people who did this to you.

07:42.662 --> 07:46.666
You know that woman, at
tricorp, she's like us.

07:46.701 --> 07:48.485
She's not like us.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.234
You know what i mean.

07:50.269 --> 07:53.873
Her eyes, they
have that same glow,
and she matched me,

07:53.908 --> 07:55.440
head to head.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.477
Maybe there's
others like us, too.

07:57.512 --> 07:59.479
To hell with that.

07:59.514 --> 08:01.045
This is war.

08:01.080 --> 08:05.885
I am a warrior
and if we die, we take
our enemies with us.

08:57.937 --> 08:59.138
What have you got?

08:59.539 --> 09:01.906
Adam,
i have run background checks
on every member of dark star.

09:01.941 --> 09:04.343
There is no indication
of any of them exhibiting
new mutant abilities.

09:04.744 --> 09:06.345
Okay. Then you
gotta dig deeper.

09:06.746 --> 09:08.347
We've got to find a
link that'll tell us where

09:08.382 --> 09:10.715
they might be holed up.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.553
Whatever
connection there is between
tricorp botanical and dark

09:13.588 --> 09:15.955
star is directly related
to what happened to them in

09:15.990 --> 09:17.922
the jungles of bogota.

09:17.957 --> 09:20.760
All right, then,
why don't you dig around
in the tricorp database?

09:23.563 --> 09:25.530
How about this, adam?

09:25.565 --> 09:31.170
Specialist
sergeant angel dorn's
father owns an abandoned

09:31.205 --> 09:34.774
engine plant at westhaven.

09:34.809 --> 09:35.940
Good.

09:35.975 --> 09:37.141
That's it.

09:37.176 --> 09:39.378
And i'll send
shalimar and brennan.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.581
You two stay here
and research tricorp.

09:53.993 --> 09:55.159
Careful.

09:55.194 --> 09:56.761
They're ferals.

09:56.796 --> 09:59.999
If i can hear them,
they can hear us.

10:00.034 --> 10:01.566
Trust me.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.167
I can handle myself.

10:03.202 --> 10:04.804
We're talking about
a really big guy.

10:05.204 --> 10:07.607
Yeah, you know, i think you
made your point all right?

10:08.007 --> 10:10.409
Let's not forget, i have
the element of surprise.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.011
Yeah, well,
save your energy.

10:12.046 --> 10:13.613
You're
going to need it.

10:14.013 --> 10:15.615
Yeah.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.019
C'mon.

10:32.431 --> 10:35.635
Turn it off, sparky,
or we'll kill you now.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.376
We're just here to talk.

10:45.411 --> 10:47.813
People who just
want to talk don't make
that kind of entrance.

10:48.214 --> 10:49.780
She's got a
dramatic streak, okay?

10:49.815 --> 10:52.418
You know, we're
all on the same side here.

10:52.453 --> 10:54.986
Then why did you interfere
with us at tricorp?

10:55.021 --> 10:57.023
Because when new mutants go
on a crime spree you put all

10:57.423 --> 10:58.990
the rest of us in danger.

10:59.025 --> 11:00.626
What the hell
is a new mutant?

11:01.027 --> 11:02.193
C'mon.

11:02.228 --> 11:03.794
Children of genomex.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.431
I'm an elemental,
she's a feral like you two.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.033
We don't know anything about
any children of genomex.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.236
What we know is that tricorp
murdered my squad and

11:10.271 --> 11:12.638
turned us into freaks.

11:13.039 --> 11:15.006
Freaks.

11:15.041 --> 11:19.045
Well, we certainly
know how you feel.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.816
Well, genomex is definitely
a silent partner in tricorp

11:25.851 --> 11:29.254
botanicals,
but beyond the business
relationship, i couldn't

11:29.289 --> 11:32.658
dig up anything
you might call dirty
in their database at all.

11:33.059 --> 11:35.461
Yeah, and we also know that
genomex's involvement doesn't

11:35.861 --> 11:37.463
necessarily mean anything.

11:37.498 --> 11:38.664
Yeah.

11:39.065 --> 11:40.631
The only thing
of interest was this.

11:40.666 --> 11:43.069
Seems to be their
primary research project.

11:43.104 --> 11:45.471
It's beautiful.

11:45.506 --> 11:47.438
All right.

11:47.473 --> 11:49.075
That's the link
we were looking for.

11:49.475 --> 11:52.278
It's a plant
called reflisha prisay.

11:52.313 --> 11:54.280
Apparently
it's extremely rare.

11:54.680 --> 11:58.083
Only twelve or so plants are
known to exist in the world.

11:58.118 --> 12:01.487
And the hydroponic garden
at tricorp botanical has three

12:01.522 --> 12:03.489
of them housed
in their greenhouse.

12:03.524 --> 12:05.491
Why am i not surprised?

12:05.891 --> 12:09.095
The reflisha
prisay is a genetically
engineered parasitic plant

12:09.130 --> 12:12.298
which spends most of its life
as a thread-like infection

12:12.333 --> 12:14.700
strand within a host.

12:14.735 --> 12:16.267
Yeah.

12:16.302 --> 12:17.903
What's the big
deal with this plant?

12:17.938 --> 12:19.070
All right.

12:19.105 --> 12:22.108
In the early
days of dna research,
we were humbled to learn

12:22.143 --> 12:25.111
that the genetic difference
between a human being and yeast

12:25.146 --> 12:27.878
was a single strand of code.

12:27.913 --> 12:31.116
So we all looked for a link
between the animal world and the

12:31.151 --> 12:34.320
plant world
and the reflisha prisay
project was a misstep that

12:34.355 --> 12:38.324
genomex made in their
attempt to manipulate human dna.

12:38.359 --> 12:41.127
The twenty-five-year
growth cycle have anything

12:41.527 --> 12:42.728
to do with the problems?

12:42.763 --> 12:43.894
Exactly.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.531
I thought the project
was dead a long time ago.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.533
I guess they just put aside
'til the next twenty-five-year

12:47.568 --> 12:49.100
cycle came along.

12:49.135 --> 12:51.137
And we have
to assume that dark star's
attack on tricorp has

12:51.172 --> 12:52.338
something to do with it.

12:52.738 --> 12:54.340
So, listen, why don't you
two coordinate your efforts,

12:54.740 --> 12:56.342
see what you can find out
about what tricorp may be up

12:56.377 --> 12:57.543
to with this project now?

12:57.578 --> 12:58.744
Okay?

13:01.947 --> 13:05.151
Dark star is
an incursion drop team.

13:05.186 --> 13:07.518
Was.

13:07.553 --> 13:11.757
Three months ago, we were
assigned to a search and destroy

13:11.792 --> 13:15.961
mission in the rain forest
outside of bogota to take out a

13:15.996 --> 13:17.928
landing field
serving the cartels.

13:17.963 --> 13:21.967
As always,
we had what we figured was
the usual run of vaccinations.

13:22.368 --> 13:28.173
But something
started happening right
away and a few of us began

13:28.208 --> 13:33.979
getting stronger,
while most of our
squad became horribly ill.

13:34.380 --> 13:38.784
My people were
dropping like flies.

13:45.591 --> 13:47.993
And that was before
the cartel soldiers had us

13:48.028 --> 13:50.796
surrounded and under fire.

13:53.599 --> 13:55.201
Over there.

14:02.408 --> 14:05.176
I tried to call it
in but we got no response.

14:05.211 --> 14:07.613
The only way we survived was
to head deeper into the bush.

14:18.824 --> 14:23.229
A matter of
days, only angel, corporal
randall, and i were alive.

14:23.264 --> 14:26.832
We buried our fallen
comrades and expected

14:26.867 --> 14:30.836
the same fate for ourselves.

14:34.039 --> 14:38.809
Instead, we developed
incredible new abilities.

14:38.844 --> 14:42.413
We managed to take a prisoner,
a cartel drug soldier.

14:42.448 --> 14:45.250
He told us it was tricorp
botanical reps who set the whole

14:45.285 --> 14:48.053
thing up, to test a new serum
and to gauge our abilities

14:48.088 --> 14:50.673
to defend ourselves.

14:50.708 --> 14:53.224
We were human lab rats.

14:53.259 --> 14:58.063
And their
tests killed my squad.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.466
Except beau and me.

15:05.271 --> 15:07.273
Must've been all those
shots before you left.

15:07.673 --> 15:09.275
They had to have been
testing some kind of process

15:09.310 --> 15:10.841
on you without your knowledge.

15:10.876 --> 15:12.478
Yeah, then they dropped you
into what they figured was a

15:12.513 --> 15:14.445
controlled environment
to observe you.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.847
But they didn't count
on you guys getting out.

15:16.882 --> 15:21.687
What they didn't
count on was that dark
star takes care of its own.

15:21.722 --> 15:24.089
Yeah, well,
so do ferals.

15:24.490 --> 15:28.093
Among new mutants,
we're a breed apart.

15:32.898 --> 15:35.701
As you can see, the small
man is clearly stricken.

15:35.736 --> 15:37.268
Yes.

15:37.303 --> 15:40.871
And the big man,
lieutenant longstreet, is it?

15:40.906 --> 15:45.311
So he looks
to be the living incarnation
of nietzsche's dictum:

15:45.346 --> 15:48.932
What does not kill
you will make you stronger.

15:48.967 --> 15:52.518
We've passed the ninety
day mark on the tests.

15:52.918 --> 15:55.721
Chances for survival at this
point increase exponentially.

15:55.756 --> 15:58.123
Then i'd say we're
on the verge of success.

15:58.158 --> 16:00.491
I wouldn't go that far.

16:00.526 --> 16:02.893
Nine of our twelve
subjects have died.

16:02.928 --> 16:06.331
We only need one survivor to
achieve the results we desire.

16:06.366 --> 16:09.735
And assuming
lieutenant longstreet
does live, all we need is

16:09.770 --> 16:13.756
a sample of his dna to
take this to the next step.

16:13.791 --> 16:17.708
To genetically alter a
human being into a new mutant.

16:17.743 --> 16:22.147
Well, my people
should be just about in
place to bring lieutenant

16:22.182 --> 16:24.950
longstreet in
for his interview now.

16:29.755 --> 16:31.722
There's four basic
types of new mutant:

16:31.757 --> 16:33.359
There's elementals, like me;
psionics, freaks and ferals.

16:33.394 --> 16:35.761
So, beau and i...

16:36.161 --> 16:38.564
you have lived with
this all your life?

16:38.599 --> 16:41.767
What?
You mean my new mutancy?

16:41.802 --> 16:43.369
Yeah.

16:43.769 --> 16:47.773
But i gotta tell
you, it's nice knowing
you're not alone.

16:48.173 --> 16:51.377
So you two...

16:51.777 --> 16:54.980
teammates.

16:55.015 --> 16:58.148
Teammates.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.951
I let my team down.

17:00.986 --> 17:05.391
It wasn't
your fault, beau.

17:05.425 --> 17:08.157
Ten of my best people.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.560
They used them
as human guinea pigs.

17:10.596 --> 17:15.401
I have to make sure
they didn't die in vain.

17:24.209 --> 17:26.175
We've got company.

17:26.211 --> 17:30.215
Sounds like six men
coming from the north side.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.234
Two more in the back.

17:32.269 --> 17:34.245
I'll take the back.

17:34.280 --> 17:36.251
You guys get the rest.

17:36.286 --> 17:38.188
How'd they find us?

17:38.223 --> 17:40.626
Probably the
same way we did.

18:53.098 --> 18:54.700
Hey, c'mon, we gotta jam.

18:55.100 --> 18:56.702
At least a dozen agents
out there, maybe more.

18:57.102 --> 18:57.903
I have to get corporal randall.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.104
C'mon, there's no time.

18:59.139 --> 19:00.122
Let's go.

19:00.157 --> 19:01.106
We make time.

19:01.507 --> 19:03.108
Beau.

19:07.913 --> 19:09.515
We have to go.

20:14.980 --> 20:16.582
How long has
she been like this?

20:16.617 --> 20:18.949
About an hour.

20:18.984 --> 20:20.951
You know, i get the feeling
from what they told me,

20:20.986 --> 20:23.388
this is what happened
to all the other
members of dark star.

20:23.789 --> 20:25.991
How's she doing?

20:26.026 --> 20:28.158
She's stable.

20:28.193 --> 20:29.394
Her vital signs are strong.

20:29.795 --> 20:30.996
But it's the blood work
that i'm concerned about.

20:31.396 --> 20:32.598
Here. Take a look.

20:37.803 --> 20:40.606
Her blood cells are trying to
fight off a serum derived from

20:40.641 --> 20:44.026
a hybridized plant
called a reflisha prisay.

20:44.061 --> 20:47.377
Well, they just tricked
these poor bastards.

20:47.412 --> 20:51.016
They thought
they were getting
malaria vaccinations.

20:51.051 --> 20:54.620
The same kind of lies they
told your parents, right?

20:54.655 --> 20:57.823
Parents of all
the children of genomex.

20:58.223 --> 20:59.389
Yeah, but these guys thought
they were volunteering to serve

20:59.424 --> 21:02.227
their country,
not participate in some
freaky genetic experiment.

21:02.262 --> 21:05.030
Another example of the kind
of power mason eckhart has.

21:07.032 --> 21:09.835
Why we've dedicated our lives
to keeping that power in check.

21:12.638 --> 21:15.240
Adam gets the living.

21:15.275 --> 21:17.808
And we get the dead.

21:17.843 --> 21:19.845
I'm afraid your gs agents
went in with a trifle

21:19.880 --> 21:21.411
too much
self-confidence.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.448
Which would have been completely
justified if not for the

21:23.483 --> 21:25.816
annoying presence
of adam's people.

21:25.851 --> 21:28.253
Well, at least they were
able to return a test specimen

21:28.288 --> 21:29.855
to us for future study.

21:30.255 --> 21:32.658
Although
i'm far from confident
in your ability to wring

21:33.058 --> 21:35.025
answers from a corpse.

21:35.060 --> 21:37.427
I'm afraid you're
probably right.

21:37.462 --> 21:40.265
Our best hope
for a successful resolution
to this experiment

21:40.666 --> 21:42.232
is a living subject.

21:42.267 --> 21:44.670
And since only
two possible candidates
remain alive,

21:45.070 --> 21:47.072
i've got my agents
scouring the city.

21:47.472 --> 21:51.476
Our latest data would indicate
the woman, sergeant dorn,

21:51.877 --> 21:53.879
who appears
to have been stricken
with the same pathological

21:54.279 --> 21:55.846
illness that's
killed the others.

21:55.881 --> 21:58.684
Well, that
means that unless lieutenant
longstreet survives,

21:58.719 --> 22:01.086
you're in a
great deal of trouble.

22:08.694 --> 22:11.096
I promise you, if anyone
can help her, it's adam.

22:11.131 --> 22:15.901
I believed in
my superior officers.

22:15.936 --> 22:19.069
Look where that got me.

22:19.104 --> 22:21.907
Yeah, but it's not
like that with adam, beau.

22:21.942 --> 22:23.508
Is he one of you?

22:23.909 --> 22:25.075
One of us?

22:25.110 --> 22:26.712
You mean a new mutant?

22:26.747 --> 22:28.714
No.

22:29.114 --> 22:32.317
Adam made it possible
for us to survive what
genomex had done to us.

22:32.718 --> 22:35.520
And he's led us on a
campaign against the people

22:35.921 --> 22:37.522
who experimented on you.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.489
Tricorp botanical?

22:39.524 --> 22:41.526
Tricorp botanical is just
another public face for

22:41.561 --> 22:43.929
the genetic
security agency.

22:43.964 --> 22:47.898
I'm a good soldier.

22:47.933 --> 22:50.736
It's all i've ever wanted.

22:51.136 --> 22:54.339
To do my duty the best i can.

22:54.740 --> 22:57.943
But you didn't
sign up to be experimented
on without your consent.

22:57.978 --> 23:01.546
To be turned into some
rogue warrior for the gsa.

23:03.949 --> 23:05.150
Lieutenant.

23:05.550 --> 23:08.318
How is she?

23:08.353 --> 23:10.756
Her condition's stable.

23:11.156 --> 23:12.723
She's resting
comfortably.

23:12.758 --> 23:15.560
She's going to
die like the others?

23:15.961 --> 23:18.363
I'm doing everything
in my power to keep
that from happening.

23:18.398 --> 23:20.365
Oh.

23:20.766 --> 23:25.135
Now, i believe
that you and your squad
were secretly injected

23:25.170 --> 23:30.776
with a serum
derived from a hybrid plant
called the reflisha prisay.

23:30.811 --> 23:34.379
The serum killed my men.

23:34.780 --> 23:36.782
It's killing angel.

23:37.182 --> 23:41.186
Did this to me?

23:41.221 --> 23:43.153
Yes.

23:43.188 --> 23:45.555
Can you save her?

23:45.590 --> 23:48.393
Well, creating an antidote
is theoretically possible,

23:48.428 --> 23:50.395
but i'm going to
need the plant to do it.

23:50.430 --> 23:52.798
The plant at tricorp?

23:53.198 --> 23:54.765
Yes, exactly.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.802
I want you and
jesse to break in there
and get me the plant.

23:57.202 --> 23:58.769
Absolutely.

23:58.804 --> 24:00.806
But we're not
going in there alone.

24:00.841 --> 24:03.826
Beau's coming with us.

24:03.861 --> 24:06.812
We need him to do the job.

25:06.471 --> 25:08.473
The feral thing's
not half bad.

25:08.874 --> 25:10.876
Thought you might
get to like it.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.882
I got it.

26:15.740 --> 26:18.143
Not exactly your regular
garden variety, is it?

26:36.561 --> 26:38.563
We've got company.

26:40.165 --> 26:41.766
Beau and i'll
take care of these guys.

26:41.801 --> 26:43.368
Gotta get
the plant to adam.

26:43.403 --> 26:44.569
Yeah.

28:25.904 --> 28:28.306
This seems a little
low-tech for you, adam.

28:28.341 --> 28:30.674
Kind of expected you
to laser it or something.

28:30.709 --> 28:33.111
Well,
herbal medicine techniques
are as valid today as

28:33.146 --> 28:35.113
they were
a thousand years ago.

28:35.148 --> 28:36.314
Here.

28:36.715 --> 28:39.883
One man's
tribal magic is the next
man's holistic healing.

28:39.918 --> 28:43.922
We better hope
so, because all of our
modern technology doesn't

28:44.322 --> 28:46.124
seem to be doing any good.

28:46.159 --> 28:47.926
Yeah, but she's stable.

28:48.326 --> 28:49.928
Who knows for how long.

28:50.328 --> 28:51.895
Hey, what
about shalimar?

28:51.930 --> 28:53.496
We haven't heard
from her or beau.

28:53.531 --> 28:55.133
Yeah, why don't you see
if you can track her down?

28:55.168 --> 28:56.735
I'll take that.

29:00.739 --> 29:04.342
There's a longstanding tradition
in my world of tampering

29:04.377 --> 29:07.110
with human nature to
create a more perfect soldier.

29:07.145 --> 29:12.550
From the hashishin of ancient
persia to the viking berserkers

29:12.585 --> 29:17.956
to mk-ultra, men in my position
have sought the perfect way

29:18.356 --> 29:20.759
to create the perfect
monster in the field.

29:20.794 --> 29:23.526
And i believe
we're getting there.

29:23.561 --> 29:26.765
This morning, you sounded
ready to shout your success

29:27.165 --> 29:29.968
from the rooftops, dr. Harrison.

29:30.003 --> 29:31.970
Are you having any doubts?

29:32.370 --> 29:34.773
I wouldn't call
them doubts, exactly.

29:34.808 --> 29:37.575
Let's just say
i have concerns.

29:44.382 --> 29:45.583
What's his condition?

29:45.984 --> 29:47.951
He's fine.

29:47.986 --> 29:51.189
We've sedated
him so i can administer
a complete examination

29:51.224 --> 29:54.392
to find out precisely why
what killed the others seems

29:54.427 --> 29:57.813
to have thrived in
lieutenant longstreet.

29:57.848 --> 30:01.199
I'm concerned by your
concerns, dr. Harrison.

30:01.234 --> 30:04.803
It's just
the scientist in me.

30:04.838 --> 30:07.170
It's all
about control.

30:07.205 --> 30:12.410
I'll join you in the examination
room to observe the procedure.

30:45.643 --> 30:48.446
This process took a lot
longer than i thought.

30:48.481 --> 30:50.814
How are her vital signs?

30:50.849 --> 30:52.450
Her white cell
count is fluctuating,

30:52.851 --> 30:54.452
but everything
else seems constant.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.419
All right. Good.

30:56.454 --> 30:58.857
I've isolated the culture
from the reflisha prisay.

30:58.892 --> 31:02.060
Next step is
develop the antigen.

31:21.679 --> 31:24.082
You'd think someone
would notice i was missing.

31:24.117 --> 31:24.883
Shalimar?

31:25.283 --> 31:26.484
Where the hell are you?

31:26.519 --> 31:27.650
I'm at genomex.

31:27.685 --> 31:30.889
I don't know how long
i can talk, so just listen.

31:30.924 --> 31:33.291
They've got beau
in an examination lab.

31:33.326 --> 31:34.492
I'm going to bust him loose.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.494
I need you to bring the
helix to get us out of here.

31:36.529 --> 31:38.096
No. No,
you need to get the
hell out of there now.

31:38.131 --> 31:39.297
I'm not leaving beau.

31:39.697 --> 31:42.100
He wouldn't leave a team
member, and neither will i.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.102
Just be ready
to get us out of here.

31:44.137 --> 31:46.104
Hey, adam.

31:46.139 --> 31:47.270
Yeah?

31:47.305 --> 31:48.706
Just heard from shalimar.

31:48.741 --> 31:50.108
She's inside the gsa.

31:53.711 --> 31:55.713
Have you made any progress
in learning precisely why

31:55.748 --> 31:57.715
lieutenant longstreet
survived the experiment?

31:57.750 --> 31:59.717
We're getting there.

31:59.752 --> 32:01.284
Getting there.

32:01.319 --> 32:04.087
We can only move
so fast, mr. Eckhart.

32:04.122 --> 32:07.725
A sample of blood taken
from the late corporal randall

32:07.760 --> 32:10.093
has proven an invaluable tool.

32:10.128 --> 32:12.130
By comparing the
two dna structures, we've
managed to isolate the

32:12.165 --> 32:14.532
precise strand of genetic
material responsible for

32:14.567 --> 32:16.935
lieutenant
longstreet's longevity.

32:16.970 --> 32:18.501
Fascinating.

32:18.536 --> 32:22.140
Then it's true: Most
great medical advancements
point to pathology.

32:22.175 --> 32:24.908
Well,
we'll soon find out.

32:24.943 --> 32:28.546
I believe with the reflisha
prisay we've got on hand,

32:28.947 --> 32:31.714
we should be able to start
the next phase of the operation.

32:31.749 --> 32:37.355
If you are correct,
we are on the verge
of creating new mutants.

32:37.390 --> 32:40.976
Obedient and
subservient new mutants.

32:41.011 --> 32:44.527
Completely at the
service of your will.

32:44.562 --> 32:47.765
Enough to conceivably
make the children
of genomex unnecessary

32:47.800 --> 32:50.969
in the greater
scheme of things.

33:02.180 --> 33:04.547
Well, i guess all
we can do now is wait.

33:04.582 --> 33:07.785
Yeah, well, i still think i
should've gone with jesse.

33:08.186 --> 33:09.787
Well, you heard adam.

33:10.188 --> 33:12.190
He said he needed
two of us here to assist.

33:12.590 --> 33:13.391
Okay.

33:13.791 --> 33:15.358
Well, then why
didn't jesse stay?

33:15.393 --> 33:17.795
C'mon, shalimar needs more
than jesse's massing and phasing

33:17.830 --> 33:20.163
to get her and beau
out of there in one piece.

33:20.198 --> 33:22.200
Well, if you were as close
to shalimar as jesse is then

33:22.235 --> 33:24.202
i'm sure you'd understand.

33:43.421 --> 33:44.587
Brennan.

33:44.622 --> 33:47.025
Her heart has stopped.

33:47.060 --> 33:48.992
Adam.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.628
There's not enough time.

33:50.663 --> 33:52.195
What are you doing?

33:52.230 --> 33:53.831
Trying to save her life.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.437
Come on, angel.

33:59.837 --> 34:01.039
Come on.

34:03.441 --> 34:05.043
It's not working.

34:07.845 --> 34:09.047
Okay, three's a charm.

34:09.447 --> 34:11.449
Come on. Come on, angel.

34:17.054 --> 34:18.856
I guess it worked.

34:18.891 --> 34:20.375
Whoa, hey, hey, relax.

34:20.409 --> 34:21.859
You're going to be safe.

34:22.260 --> 34:24.226
Where am i?

34:24.262 --> 34:25.862
We've been
taking care of you.

34:26.264 --> 34:27.864
You're going to be okay.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.032
Where's beau?

34:29.067 --> 34:30.632
Shalimar's bringing him here.

34:30.668 --> 34:32.270
Everything's
going to be all right.

34:32.304 --> 34:33.471
You've been through a lot.

34:33.871 --> 34:35.038
Easy, easy.

34:35.072 --> 34:36.674
I'm not going to hurt you.

34:37.074 --> 34:39.077
It's okay, we're friends.

34:39.112 --> 34:40.643
Take my hand.

34:40.678 --> 34:44.681
It's okay. Come on.

34:44.717 --> 34:46.701
Good.

34:46.735 --> 34:48.686
Sit down.

34:53.491 --> 34:55.058
What's going on?

34:55.092 --> 34:58.296
Angel's heart stopped, but
brennan managed to revive her.

34:58.331 --> 35:01.499
I'm glad you were here.

35:01.534 --> 35:03.101
You okay?

35:03.501 --> 35:05.068
Good.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.704
Here, save your strength.

35:06.739 --> 35:08.123
Come here.

35:08.158 --> 35:09.633
Come here.

35:09.668 --> 35:11.109
I got an idea.

35:11.509 --> 35:14.312
Now that eckhart
has beau, i'm guessing
that security's going to

35:14.347 --> 35:16.714
be lax at tricorp botanical.

35:16.749 --> 35:18.533
What do you say?

35:18.568 --> 35:20.318
Let's do it.

35:42.673 --> 35:46.076
This may come as
a surprise, dr. Harrison,

35:46.111 --> 35:49.445
i'm not a particularly
optimistic man.

35:49.480 --> 35:53.484
That said, i have to admit
the work you've done here gives

35:53.519 --> 35:55.887
me hope for a brighter future.

35:56.287 --> 35:58.289
Thank you, mr. Eckhart.

35:58.324 --> 36:00.256
That's awfully kind.

36:00.291 --> 36:03.494
To complete our
research on this subject,
i'll inject him with a

36:03.529 --> 36:07.498
drug that will permanently
paralyze his brain function.

36:07.533 --> 36:10.301
Is that really necessary?

36:10.336 --> 36:11.868
I'm afraid so.

36:11.903 --> 36:15.506
There's no telling
how strong his mutant
abilities have become.

36:27.118 --> 36:29.320
You look a
little bit sleepy.

36:29.355 --> 36:31.840
It's time for
you to take a nap.

36:31.875 --> 36:34.325
Now, let's not
do anything rash.

36:48.739 --> 36:52.308
This is how we're
going to play this.

36:52.343 --> 36:55.546
We start by showing a
deceased soldier some respect.

36:58.349 --> 37:00.316
Beau.

37:00.351 --> 37:04.355
You don't want to do this.

37:04.755 --> 37:07.523
Why?

37:07.558 --> 37:10.361
There's nothing to go on for.

37:10.396 --> 37:12.363
That's not true.

37:17.568 --> 37:19.970
My squad is gone.

37:20.005 --> 37:22.373
That's not true.

37:24.775 --> 37:26.377
You got a new squad now.

37:30.781 --> 37:32.383
A new pack.

37:45.196 --> 37:46.797
Oh, you should
have seen it, jesse.

37:46.832 --> 37:48.399
I thought eckhart
was going to explode.

37:48.799 --> 37:50.200
I mean, touching him
must've been bad enough,

37:50.235 --> 37:51.602
but taking eckhart
hostage in a headlock?

37:52.003 --> 37:53.604
I gotta tell you,
made for a very smooth exit.

37:54.005 --> 37:56.807
But i gotta know:
Were you awake the whole time

37:56.842 --> 37:58.374
you were on that table?

37:58.409 --> 38:00.776
I woke up when
they started poking me.

38:00.811 --> 38:03.214
But one thing i have
learned with this feral stuff

38:03.614 --> 38:05.416
is turning pain away.

38:05.451 --> 38:07.218
And you're right -

38:07.618 --> 38:10.821
it's a lot easier knowing
that you're not alone.

38:11.222 --> 38:14.025
Tell me about it.

38:14.060 --> 38:17.628
Angel.

38:22.433 --> 38:23.634
Easy, big guy.

38:24.035 --> 38:26.437
Some of us aren't
as feral as others.

38:28.439 --> 38:32.043
You sure she's
going to be okay?

38:32.078 --> 38:33.244
Better than okay.

38:33.644 --> 38:35.246
You guys are
both one of us now.

38:35.281 --> 38:36.812
New mutants.

38:36.847 --> 38:38.849
Ferals,
to be exact.

38:38.884 --> 38:40.816
You got that right.

38:40.851 --> 38:42.653
What about the experiment?

38:42.688 --> 38:44.455
The
experiment was a failure.

38:44.855 --> 38:47.223
As for
tricorp botanical, well,

38:47.258 --> 38:50.061
they got some
problems of their own.

38:50.461 --> 38:52.463
Right, brennan?

38:52.863 --> 38:55.231
Absolutely.

38:55.266 --> 38:58.869
Now that we've cornered the
market on the reflisha prisay.

39:01.272 --> 39:06.677
As i said, dr. Harrison, i am
not by nature an optimistic man.

39:06.712 --> 39:12.083
The reason
is simply that i cannot
bear the disappointment that

39:12.118 --> 39:16.087
is so frequently the result
of heightened expectations.

39:16.487 --> 39:21.692
I have always subscribed to
the adage, "hope for the best,

39:27.298 --> 39:29.265
and expect the worst. "

39:29.300 --> 39:31.267
I understand that, mr. Eckhart.

39:31.302 --> 39:35.706
I also
understand that the trauma
of your experience yesterday,

39:35.741 --> 39:37.708
along with the loss
of lieutenant longstreet,

39:37.743 --> 39:40.528
must be very
difficult to accommodate.

39:40.563 --> 39:43.314
But we still have
the reflisha prisay.

39:43.349 --> 39:45.716
Is that right?

39:46.117 --> 39:51.722
I gather you haven't checked
in at your office this morning.

39:51.757 --> 39:52.523
No.

39:52.923 --> 39:54.090
I came directly here.

39:54.125 --> 39:56.927
And you haven't
heard about the security
breach last night.

40:10.141 --> 40:13.944
Preliminary laboratory analysis
indicates that the last specimen

40:13.979 --> 40:17.748
was destroyed by an application
of high voltage electricity.

40:17.783 --> 40:21.752
It's most likely the
work of brennan mulwray.

40:21.787 --> 40:26.122
He's one of adam's people.

40:26.157 --> 40:29.160
Perhaps we could
accelerate the growth rate.

40:29.195 --> 40:32.163
Take some time off
that twenty-five years.

40:32.563 --> 40:35.366
Who knows where i'll
be in twenty-five years?

40:35.401 --> 40:39.370
But i have a good
idea where you'll be.

41:27.418 --> 41:29.620
This is how it should be.

41:29.655 --> 41:31.787
To all of our fallen heroes,

41:31.822 --> 41:34.625
who fought with honour
and died with grace.

41:41.031 --> 41:44.235
I know
your squad would be really
proud of what you've done.

41:44.635 --> 41:46.237
I hope so.

41:46.637 --> 41:49.004
Angel and i, we...

41:49.039 --> 41:51.041
we don't know
how to thank you.

41:55.446 --> 41:57.848
You don't have to.
