WEBVTT

00:03.133 --> 00:05.133
- I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME
A DAY EARLY, HONEY.

00:05.633 --> 00:07.433
- ME TOO, MOM.

00:07.433 --> 00:10.600
I'M ALMOST LOOKING
FORWARD TO THIS.

00:10.600 --> 00:12.233
[doorbell rings]

00:12.233 --> 00:16.033
- [flat] OH, GOOD.
THEY'RE HERE.

00:20.867 --> 00:21.933
- HELLO, HUSBAND.

00:21.933 --> 00:24.233
- HELLO, WIFE.

00:24.233 --> 00:25.833
- I MISSED YOU.

00:25.833 --> 00:27.133
- OH, I MISSED YOU TOO.

00:27.133 --> 00:28.600
- HEY, IT'S WINTER
OUT HERE.

00:28.600 --> 00:32.000
- OOH! I'M SORRY.
COME IN.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.933
- HELLO.
- WELL, WELCOME.

00:33.933 --> 00:35.900
- HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

00:35.900 --> 00:37.133
- HOW ARE YOU?
- HELLO.

00:37.133 --> 00:38.567
- HOW WAS THE DRIVE?
[door closes]

00:38.567 --> 00:39.833
- LONG.

00:39.833 --> 00:42.967
BUT--BUT FUN
'CAUSE WE'RE JUST,

00:42.967 --> 00:47.067
"PENNSYLVANIA!
CAN'T WAIT!"

00:47.067 --> 00:51.200
- GOOD DAY,
FAIR BARONES...

00:51.200 --> 00:55.133
ON THIS FESTIVAL
OF THANKS AND GIVINGNESS.

00:59.033 --> 01:01.033
- WELL, HERE,
LET ME TAKE YOUR COATS.

01:01.033 --> 01:04.833
- DON'T GO TOO FAR WITH THOSE.

01:04.833 --> 01:08.033
- DAD, BE A PERSON.

01:08.033 --> 01:09.900
- SORRY WE'RE SO LATE.

01:09.900 --> 01:12.833
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
DINNER'S ALMOST READY.

01:12.833 --> 01:14.833
- I BROUGHT PIES FOR AFTER.

01:14.833 --> 01:16.967
- OH, THANK YOU, MARIE.

01:16.967 --> 01:22.633
- I MADE TWO IN CASE
PEOPLE DON'T FILL UP ON DINNER.

01:29.133 --> 01:30.667
- WELL, WHY DOESN'T EVERYONE
HAVE A SEAT?

01:31.600 --> 01:35.233
- JUST POINT US
TO THE ROOM WITH THE TV.

01:35.233 --> 01:38.400
- OH, WE DON'T OWN
A TV.

01:43.967 --> 01:47.867
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

01:47.867 --> 01:50.933
- YOU KNOW, IT'S FINE, FRANK.
WE'LL JUST TALK.

01:50.933 --> 01:54.233
- OH.
- OH.

01:54.233 --> 01:56.867
- YOU CAN WARM YOURSELVES UP
WITH SOME HOT CIDER.

01:56.867 --> 01:59.333
- IS IT SPIKED?

01:59.333 --> 02:02.333
- THERE'S CINNAMON.

02:02.333 --> 02:04.800
- SO I DROVE HERE
FOR HOT JUICE.

02:04.800 --> 02:08.733
- AND, CHILDREN,
WE ALSO HAVE

02:08.733 --> 02:13.033
THE MACDOUGALL FAMILY
THANKSGIVING PAGEANT.

02:15.167 --> 02:20.367
- THE--THE MACDOUGALL...
WHAT?

02:20.367 --> 02:21.900
- OH, DID I FORGET
TO MENTION THAT TO YOU GUYS?

02:21.900 --> 02:23.000
THIS IS FUN.
LISTEN TO THIS.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.967
THIS IS GREAT.

02:25.967 --> 02:27.467
- WHEN PETER AND I
WERE KIDS,

02:27.467 --> 02:29.500
WE USED TO PUT ON A PLAY
ABOUT THE FIRST THANKSGIVING.

02:29.500 --> 02:32.300
AND WE THOUGHT THAT,
SINCE ALLY AND THE BOYS

02:32.300 --> 02:33.367
WERE COMING THIS YEAR,

02:33.367 --> 02:35.100
WE COULD TRY IT AGAIN.

02:35.100 --> 02:38.400
- DOESN'T THAT SOUND
LIKE FUN, KIDS?

02:43.367 --> 02:47.267
- YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE, LIKE,
A LITTLE EMERGENCY TV?

02:49.533 --> 02:51.400
- THE KIDS CAN PLAY
MOST OF THE PARTS,

02:51.400 --> 02:54.467
AND PETER WILL REPRISE
HIS ROLE AS...

02:54.467 --> 02:58.067
- SQUANTO.

03:01.533 --> 03:03.800
- ALL RIGHT, CHILDREN,
IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW ME,

03:03.800 --> 03:07.100
I HAVE COSTUMES
AND DECORATIONS.

03:08.300 --> 03:11.533
AND CANDY.
- OKAY!

03:11.533 --> 03:15.200
- OH, THEY'LL BE SO CUTE
DOING THE PLAY.

03:15.200 --> 03:19.000
- THIS IS GREAT.
DINNER AND A SHOW!

03:25.333 --> 03:27.400
- YOU HAVE A RADIO?
- RAY.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.567
- WHAT?

03:29.567 --> 03:31.700
WHAT IF--WHAT IF
THE PRESIDENT COMES ON

03:31.700 --> 03:33.333
TO SAY THANKSGIVING'S
BEEN CANCELED?

03:33.333 --> 03:37.133
HOW ARE WE GOING
TO HEAR THAT?

03:40.600 --> 03:43.233
- HEY, THIS CHAIR AIN'T BAD.
I TELL YOU SOMETHING.

03:43.233 --> 03:45.167
I COULD DO SOME SERIOUS NAPPING
IN THIS THING.

03:45.167 --> 03:46.933
- FRANK.
- [snores]

03:46.933 --> 03:49.300
- COME ON, STOP IT.
STOP IT.

03:49.300 --> 03:52.700
- WHAT? WHAT?
WHAT? WHAT?

03:57.033 --> 04:00.067
- DON'T GET MY DAD
STARTED ON NAPS.

04:00.067 --> 04:04.367
- DON'T TELL ME--
HE'S MORALLY AGAINST 'EM.

04:04.367 --> 04:06.800
- OH, NO.
HE LOVES NAPS.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.100
RIGHT, DADDY?

04:08.100 --> 04:09.633
- I DO.

04:09.633 --> 04:10.967
BUT NEVER IN A CHAIR.

04:10.967 --> 04:14.733
I'M MORE
OF A BED MAN.

04:14.733 --> 04:18.000
- INTERESTING.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.333
LET ME ASK YOU,

04:19.333 --> 04:22.267
DO YOU GO ALL THE WAY
UNDER THE COVERS?

04:22.267 --> 04:23.900
- NO, NO.
NO, NO, JUST ON TOP.

04:23.900 --> 04:25.733
NOW, I MIGHT
KICK OFF MY SHOES,

04:25.733 --> 04:30.367
BUT THAT'S
AS FAR AS IT GOES.

04:32.333 --> 04:34.100
- WELL, LET ME TELL YOU,
IF I'M DOING A BED NAP,

04:34.100 --> 04:38.500
I'M GETTING UNDER THE COVERS,
BUT MY PANTS ARE NOT.

04:40.733 --> 04:42.100
- I'VE GOT PASTRY PUFFS.

04:42.100 --> 04:44.533
- OH.
- YEAH.

04:44.533 --> 04:47.867
- HEY, MOM, DAD AND FRANK
ARE TALKING ABOUT NAPS.

04:47.867 --> 04:51.167
- OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL.

04:51.167 --> 04:52.367
- DO YOURSELF
A FAVOR, HANK.

04:52.367 --> 04:54.300
TRY A NAP
IN THE CHAIR SOMETIME.

04:54.300 --> 04:56.933
- I MIGHT JUST DO THAT
AFTER DINNER.

04:56.933 --> 05:01.100
- THERE YOU GO!

05:01.100 --> 05:02.900
- WOULD YOU LIKE
AN APPETIZER, MARIE?

05:02.900 --> 05:03.933
THEY'RE HOMEMADE.

05:03.933 --> 05:07.467
- OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

05:07.467 --> 05:09.600
- OH, BUT I'D LOVE
FOR YOU TO TRY ONE.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.633
EVERYONE SAYS
YOU'RE THE BEST COOK THERE IS.

05:16.133 --> 05:20.700
- WELL,
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT.

05:20.700 --> 05:24.067
I'D LOVE TO TRY ONE.

05:26.367 --> 05:30.033
MMM! I HAVE TO SAY,
THAT'S MARVELOUS.

05:30.033 --> 05:31.700
- OH, THANK YOU.

05:31.700 --> 05:32.933
- SHE'S BEEN SO WORRIED

05:32.933 --> 05:34.533
ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE GOING
TO THINK OF HER DINNER.

05:34.533 --> 05:39.367
- OH...
WHO CARES WHAT I THINK?

05:39.367 --> 05:40.700
- MOM!

05:40.700 --> 05:43.833
THE BOYS ARE PUTTING GLUE
IN EACH OTHER'S HAIR.

05:43.833 --> 05:45.233
- OH, NO!

05:45.233 --> 05:47.600
- I'M SURPRISED
IT TOOK THEM THIS LONG.

05:47.600 --> 05:51.367
OKAY, SWEETIE, MOMMY WILL HELP
YOU STICK 'EM TO THE WALL.

05:51.367 --> 05:53.033
- HOW GREAT IS THIS?
ISN'T THIS GREAT?

05:53.033 --> 05:57.367
IT'S LIKE A FAMILY.

05:57.367 --> 06:00.000
- I HAVE MORE APPETIZERS
IN THE KITCHEN.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.500
- OH, I'LL COME WITH YOU.

06:01.500 --> 06:05.333
I WANT TO SEE WHAT ELSE
WE HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

06:05.333 --> 06:10.833
- DON'T PUT GLUE
IN EACH OTHER'S HAIR.

06:10.833 --> 06:13.300
[thump]
- WHAT WAS THAT?

06:13.300 --> 06:15.967
- SOUNDED LIKE SOMETHING
HIT THE HOUSE.

06:15.967 --> 06:18.733
[door opens]

06:18.733 --> 06:20.600
OH, IT'S A BIRD.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.500
- IT MUST'VE FLOWN
INTO THE WINDOW.

06:22.500 --> 06:23.433
- OH.

06:23.433 --> 06:25.133
- OH, MAN.
IT'S HURT.

06:25.133 --> 06:26.400
- OH, WHAT DO WE DO?

06:26.400 --> 06:28.433
- DON'T SQUEEZE IT.
BE CAREFUL.

06:28.433 --> 06:30.233
- UH, DON'T WORRY.
I GOT IT.

06:30.233 --> 06:31.467
- DON'T HOLD IT TOO TIGHT.

06:31.467 --> 06:33.867
I KNOW BIRDS.
I BUILD BIRDHOUSES.

06:33.867 --> 06:35.133
- MAY I SEE IT?

06:35.133 --> 06:36.933
[door shuts]

06:36.933 --> 06:38.733
OH, MY.

06:38.733 --> 06:41.567
LET ME HELP YOU.

06:41.567 --> 06:42.800
- AW, POOR THING.

06:42.800 --> 06:46.000
- HE MUST'VE GOTTEN
CONFUSED OR SOMETHING.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.833
- HEY, HEY,
REMEMBER TWEETY?

06:47.833 --> 06:49.400
- YEAH.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.067
- YEAH, WHEN WE WERE KIDS,

06:51.067 --> 06:52.600
WE HAD
A COCKATIEL NAMED TWEETY.

06:52.600 --> 06:54.600
- I TRAINED HIM
SO WHEN I OPENED HIS CAGE,

06:54.600 --> 06:56.833
HE'D FLY RIGHT UP
ONTO MY SHOULDER.

06:56.833 --> 06:59.767
HE THOUGHT
I WAS A TREE.

07:03.733 --> 07:06.500
- HERE WE GO.
- OH, HOW'S THE BIRD?

07:06.500 --> 07:08.200
- OH, I TOOK
CARE OF IT.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.467
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:09.467 --> 07:10.300
- YOU KNOW--

07:24.233 --> 07:25.133
- YOU KILLED THE BIRD?

07:26.133 --> 07:29.233
- I HAD TO PUT IT
OUT OF ITS MISERY.

07:29.233 --> 07:32.833
- YOU MEAN, YOU ACTUALLY
PUT IT TO DEATH?

07:32.833 --> 07:34.833
- IT WAS VERY QUICK.

07:34.833 --> 07:36.233
- HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

07:36.233 --> 07:41.033
- OH,
SHE'S VERY GOOD AT IT.

07:41.033 --> 07:43.200
- YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE?

07:43.200 --> 07:45.600
- SURE.
ALL THE TIME.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.700
- WELL, ONLY WHEN
THEY HIT THE HOUSE.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.400
- I THINK, IF BIRDS KEEP FLYING
INTO YOUR HOUSE,

07:50.400 --> 07:53.433
YOU GOT
TO WARN THEM SOMEHOW.

07:53.433 --> 07:55.867
- MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST COVER
THE HOUSE WITH MATTRESSES,

07:55.867 --> 07:59.333
SO THE BIRDS BOUNCE OFF.

08:03.333 --> 08:08.067
- ARE YOU MAKING FUN OF ME,
COCOA PUFFS?

08:08.067 --> 08:09.600
- OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

08:09.600 --> 08:12.267
LET'S ALL TAKE A DEEP BREATH
AND TRY TO REMEMBER

08:12.267 --> 08:15.133
THAT THE BIRD
IS IN A BETTER PLACE.

08:15.133 --> 08:16.300
BIRDIE HEAVEN,

08:16.300 --> 08:18.300
WHERE THE SEED IS FREE,

08:18.300 --> 08:20.967
AND EVERY BIRD
GETS A WORM--

08:20.967 --> 08:24.400
NOT JUST THE EARLY ONES.

08:24.400 --> 08:28.033
- SHE SHOULD TAKE YOU
INTO THE KITCHEN.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.033
- [stammers]
EXCUSE ME,

08:34.033 --> 08:35.967
BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW
THE BIRD COULDN'T BE SAVED?

08:35.967 --> 08:37.567
I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT
A VETERINARIAN.

08:37.567 --> 08:42.500
- NO, BUT I HAVE LIVED
IN THE COUNTRY MY WHOLE LIFE.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.367
- MOM GREW UP
ON A FARM.

08:44.367 --> 08:48.067
- I BET THE CHICKENS SLEPT
WITH ONE EYE OPEN.

08:55.667 --> 08:57.233
- IT'S FUNNY,
ISN'T IT, MOTHER,

08:57.233 --> 08:59.233
HOW CITY FOLK REACT
TO THIS TYPE OF THING?

08:59.233 --> 09:02.600
- THAT POOR BIRD WAS
INNOCENTLY FLYING AROUND,

09:02.600 --> 09:05.267
YOU KILL IT,
YOU DON'T EVEN SEEM TO CARE.

09:05.267 --> 09:08.100
- IT'S NOT THAT
WE DON'T CARE, MARIE.

09:08.100 --> 09:10.033
IT'S JUST, OUT HERE,

09:10.033 --> 09:11.633
THERE ARE ANIMALS
ALL AROUND US,

09:11.633 --> 09:13.967
AND SOMETIMES YOU DO
WHAT HAS TO BE DONE.

09:13.967 --> 09:17.433
- YES, LIKE WHEN A RODENT
GETS INTO THE ROOT CELLAR,

09:17.433 --> 09:21.000
YOU DON'T WANT
TO BANG IT WITH A SHOVEL...

09:26.067 --> 09:29.500
BUT YOU DO.

09:29.500 --> 09:33.267
- BONG!

09:33.267 --> 09:34.767
- YOU GOT NO RIGHT
TO GO AROUND

09:34.767 --> 09:36.667
BUMPING OFF GOD'S CREATURES
WILLY-NILLY.

09:36.667 --> 09:39.667
- WELL, LET'S REMEMBER, FRANK,
GOD DID SAY,

09:39.667 --> 09:42.767
"LET MAN HAVE DOMINION
OVER THE FISH OF THE SEA,

09:42.767 --> 09:44.267
"AND THE FOWL OF THE AIR,

09:44.267 --> 09:49.667
AND EVERY CREEPING THING
THAT CREEPETH UPON THE EARTH."

09:52.067 --> 09:56.533
- YOU CREEPETH ME OUT.

10:02.833 --> 10:05.300
- YOU KNOW, FRANK, I WOULD LIKE
TO SAY SOMETHING TO YOU.

10:05.300 --> 10:09.367
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU CARE
MORE ABOUT ANIMALS

10:09.367 --> 10:11.233
THAN YOU DO ABOUT PEOPLE.

10:11.233 --> 10:12.900
- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

10:12.900 --> 10:15.367
- WELL, I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU SHOW
AS MUCH COMPASSION

10:15.367 --> 10:16.700
FOR ANY HUMAN BEING

10:16.700 --> 10:18.800
AS YOU'VE JUST SHOWN
FOR THAT BIRD.

10:18.800 --> 10:22.267
AND EVEN THE WAY YOU TREAT
EACH OTHER IS APPALLING.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.733
- HEY, I THINK I KNOW
A COUPLE OF FELLAS

10:26.733 --> 10:30.333
WHO COULD USE A NAP.

10:32.667 --> 10:35.567
- LISTEN, PAL,
WE TELL IT LIKE IT IS.

10:35.567 --> 10:37.600
SOMEBODY'S BOTHERING ME,
I LET 'EM KNOW.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.900
AND, YEAH, MAYBE THAT'S
WHY I LIKE ANIMALS.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.867
THEY TELL IT
LIKE IT IS.

10:41.867 --> 10:46.100
WOOF! MOO!
QUACK!

10:46.100 --> 10:49.367
THAT'S STRAIGHT SHOOTING.

10:49.367 --> 10:52.633
- SO YOU'RE
LIKE AN ANIMAL.

10:52.633 --> 10:57.133
- [laughs] YES.

10:57.133 --> 10:58.467
- I'M HONEST.

10:58.467 --> 11:00.300
YOU DON'T LOVE
YOUR FELLOW MAN.

11:00.300 --> 11:01.500
YOU JUST PRETEND
TO BE ALL NICEY-NICE,

11:01.500 --> 11:03.467
SO YOU CAN GET
A TICKET UPSTAIRS.

11:03.467 --> 11:06.300
- OH!

11:06.300 --> 11:10.067
- OKAY,
NOW IT'S A HOLIDAY.

11:12.300 --> 11:15.267
- WE WOULD NEVER
PRETEND LIKE THAT.

11:15.267 --> 11:19.533
WE ALWAYS TRY
TO SEE THE GOODNESS IN PEOPLE.

11:19.533 --> 11:23.133
EVEN WHEN IT'S
VERY, VERY HARD.

11:23.133 --> 11:25.433
- I HAPPEN TO AGREE
WITH MY HUSBAND.

11:25.433 --> 11:26.733
YOU CAN'T
JUST PUT ON A SMILE

11:26.733 --> 11:28.533
AND PRETEND
THAT PEOPLE ARE WONDERFUL.

11:28.533 --> 11:32.800
- YEAH, NOBODY REALLY--
- I'M TALKING NOW, FRANK.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.300
I HAVE ALWAYS FELT

11:34.300 --> 11:37.400
THAT IF I'M GOING
TO BE A LOVING HUMAN BEING,

11:37.400 --> 11:39.700
I ALSO HAD
TO BE COURAGEOUS ENOUGH

11:39.700 --> 11:40.833
TO BE HONEST WITH PEOPLE.

11:40.833 --> 11:44.233
BEING FAKE HELPS NO ONE.

11:46.933 --> 11:48.567
[stammers]
WHAT IS THAT LOOK?

11:48.567 --> 11:50.633
- IT'S JUST--
WELL, I WAS THINKING

11:50.633 --> 11:52.467
ABOUT WHEN YOU SAID
YOU MADE TWO PIES

11:52.467 --> 11:56.600
IN CASE PEOPLE DIDN'T
FILL UP ON DINNER.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.100
I DON'T THINK
YOU WERE HAPPY

11:58.100 --> 11:59.567
TO BE SPENDING
THANKSGIVING WITH US,

11:59.567 --> 12:01.700
BUT YOU COVERED
YOUR TRUE FEELINGS

12:01.700 --> 12:05.133
WITH A VEILED INSULT
ABOUT MY COOKING.

12:05.133 --> 12:08.033
ISN'T THAT FAKE?

12:11.067 --> 12:14.700
- YOU KILLED A BIRD!

12:16.767 --> 12:20.100
- MARIE, MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST LET THE BIRD THING GO.

12:20.100 --> 12:21.367
- WHOA, WHOA, AMY, LOOK,

12:21.367 --> 12:22.967
LET'S NOT GET SUCKED
INTO THIS, OKAY?

12:22.967 --> 12:27.200
I MEAN, I'M NOT TAKING
MY FAMILY'S SIDE.

12:27.200 --> 12:32.100
- WELL, OF COURSE NOT.
THEY'RE ACTING ALL NUTS.

12:32.100 --> 12:34.267
- THEY'RE NUTS?

12:34.267 --> 12:35.933
- WELL, WHAT
WOULD YOU CALL IT

12:35.933 --> 12:39.367
WHEN A MAN BARKS
AND QUACKS AT YOU?

12:39.367 --> 12:42.200
- MY FATHER
WAS BARKING AND QUACKING

12:42.200 --> 12:44.033
BECAUSE HE WAS UPSET

12:44.033 --> 12:46.367
ABOUT THE PATH
OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION

12:46.367 --> 12:50.467
THAT YOUR PARENTS HAVE CUT
THROUGH THE ANIMAL COMMUNITY!

12:56.200 --> 13:00.233
- THAT'S MY BOY!

13:00.233 --> 13:04.367
- THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN
IF YOU HAVE A TV.

13:04.367 --> 13:07.667
- THEN YOU MUST THINK
I'M A MURDERER TOO.

13:07.667 --> 13:09.200
WHEN I WAS A KID,
I USED TO CATCH FIELD MICE

13:09.200 --> 13:11.200
TO FEED
TO PETER'S PET SNAKE.

13:11.200 --> 13:14.367
- [chomps ferociously]

13:14.367 --> 13:17.033
- YOU CRAZY BASTARD.

13:17.033 --> 13:18.800
THEY'RE ALL KILLERS.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.100
IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.200
- I WISH
WE STILL HAD THAT SNAKE.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.767
- FRANK! THEY WANT
TO FEED US TO THE SNAKES!

13:24.767 --> 13:26.900
- ALL RIGHT.

13:26.900 --> 13:28.033
JUST RELAX, YOU TWO, OKAY?

13:28.033 --> 13:32.133
NO SNAKE IS THAT HUNGRY.

13:33.933 --> 13:36.667
[kids imitate war whooping]
- HEY, EVERYBODY!

13:36.667 --> 13:38.200
HERE THEY COME!

13:38.200 --> 13:40.300
- WHAT'S THIS?
- ISN'T THIS GREAT?

13:40.300 --> 13:42.467
THERE'S A PART FOR EVERYBODY
IN THE PLAY.

13:42.467 --> 13:44.467
- NOT ME.
FORGET IT.

13:44.467 --> 13:47.400
- BUT, GRANDPA,
YOU'RE THE INDIAN CHIEF.

13:47.400 --> 13:50.233
- I SEE NO REASON WHY HE
SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN OUR PLAY.

13:50.233 --> 13:54.033
- OH, YOU DON'T WANT ME
IN YOUR PLAY?

14:01.167 --> 14:02.733
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:02.733 --> 14:03.833
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

14:03.833 --> 14:05.733
- NO TV.

14:05.733 --> 14:07.333
- DADDY, WE WANT YOU
TO BE SQUANTO.

14:07.333 --> 14:08.733
- WHAT?
- YEAH, SQUANTO.

14:08.733 --> 14:09.867
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, NO.

14:09.867 --> 14:11.233
[laughing]
HOLD ON A SECOND.

14:11.233 --> 14:15.033
NO, NO.
I AM ALWAYS SQUANTO.

14:17.533 --> 14:18.600
OKAY?

14:18.600 --> 14:20.500
- BUT WE WANT
DADDY TO DO IT.

14:20.500 --> 14:21.667
- YEAH, DADDY.

14:21.667 --> 14:22.933
- KID, I ALWAYS DO IT.
LET ME HAVE THE FEATHER.

14:22.933 --> 14:24.533
COME ON,
LET ME HAVE THE FEATHER.

14:24.533 --> 14:26.600
- HEY, HEY, LEAVE THE KID.
- LET ME HAVE THE FEATHER.

14:26.600 --> 14:30.200
- HEY!

14:35.200 --> 14:39.500
I'M SQUANTO!

14:43.133 --> 14:44.733
YEAH.

14:44.733 --> 14:47.833
FEELS GOOD.

14:47.833 --> 14:50.967
HEAP GOOD.

14:50.967 --> 14:54.333
- FINE.

14:54.333 --> 14:58.633
I LOOK FORWARD
TO YOUR INTERPRETATION.

15:12.900 --> 15:15.600
- MARIE, UH, WE THOUGHT
YOU'D BE A PILGRIM.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.733
SO IF YOU'LL
JUST TAKE THE HAT...

15:27.400 --> 15:30.867
- MAYBE THE PAGEANT
ISN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA TODAY.

15:30.867 --> 15:33.000
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
IT'S THANKSGIVING!

15:33.000 --> 15:34.467
- NO. LET'S JUST FORGET IT.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.933
- NO! I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,

15:36.933 --> 15:38.467
BUT CERTAIN PEOPLE
IN THIS ROOM

15:38.467 --> 15:40.900
ARE VERY EXCITED
ABOUT DOING THIS PLAY, OKAY?

15:40.900 --> 15:42.600
SO WE'RE GOING TO DO IT.

15:42.600 --> 15:46.067
- OH, DEBRA, DON'T YOU--
- DIT-DIT-DIT-DIT!

15:46.067 --> 15:48.567
WE'RE DOING THE PLAY.

15:48.567 --> 15:52.367
KIDS, LET'S GO.
ALLY, SWEETIE.

15:55.333 --> 15:58.333
- "THE FIRST THANKSGIVING.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.067
"THE PILGRIMS LANDED
AT PLYMOUTH ROCK

16:00.067 --> 16:02.333
"IN THE WINTER
OF 1620,

16:02.333 --> 16:03.633
"LOOKING FOR FREEDOM
AND A NEW LIFE.

16:03.633 --> 16:06.733
BUT THINGS WERE NOT EASY
FOR THEM."

16:09.333 --> 16:11.433
- "THE WINTER
IS SO VERY HARD.

16:11.433 --> 16:15.100
MANY OF OUR PEOPLE ARE DYING
FROM COLD AND HUNGER."

16:15.100 --> 16:16.500
- "BUT WE CAN'T FIND
ANY FOOD."

16:16.500 --> 16:19.800
- "WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO CATCH FISH.

16:19.800 --> 16:23.567
WHAT EVER WILL WE DO?"

16:23.567 --> 16:27.400
- SHE SHOULD TRY STRANGLING
A COUPLE OF BIRDS.

16:36.367 --> 16:41.267
- DID ANYONE HEAR
SOME SAVAGES TALKING?

16:44.033 --> 16:45.400
- "A NATIVE AMERICAN
NAMED SQUANTO

16:45.400 --> 16:48.567
CAME TO THE PILGRIM VILLAGE."

16:52.933 --> 16:54.967
- "MY NAME IS SQUANTO"--

16:54.967 --> 16:58.267
- OOH! RIVETING!

16:59.800 --> 17:02.767
- "MY NAME IS SQUANTO.
I COME IN PEACE."

17:02.767 --> 17:06.067
- "HELLO."
- HEY. OH.

17:06.067 --> 17:07.433
"HEY. HI.

17:07.433 --> 17:09.867
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW
TO LIVE OFF THIS LAND."

17:09.867 --> 17:14.500
- "SQUANTO TAUGHT THE PILGRIMS
HOW TO CATCH FISH."

17:28.000 --> 17:29.367
- [scoffs]

17:29.367 --> 17:34.033
IS ANYBODY BUYING
THIS GUY AS SQUANTO?

17:34.033 --> 17:35.467
- YOU LEAVE HIM ALONE.

17:35.467 --> 17:39.267
HE HASN'T HAD A CHANCE
TO EXERCISE LATELY.

17:45.200 --> 17:46.433
- "CAN YOU ALSO TEACH US

17:46.433 --> 17:49.033
TO PLANT CORN
AND FORAGE FOR BERRIES?"

17:49.033 --> 17:52.667
- "YES, I CAN."

17:57.600 --> 18:01.200
OH. EH.

18:07.467 --> 18:09.567
- "SQUANTO AND THE PILGRIMS
BECAME FRIENDS,

18:09.567 --> 18:11.933
BUT SQUANTO'S TRIBE
DID NOT LIKE THE SETTLERS."

18:11.933 --> 18:15.567
- THIS IS
AN EXCELLENT PLAY.

18:19.900 --> 18:21.700
- "I THINK WE SHOULD BE FRIENDS
WITH THE PILGRIMS

18:21.700 --> 18:23.067
AND SIGN A PEACE TREATY."

18:23.067 --> 18:25.100
- "YES, WE PROMISE
TO PROTECT YOUR PEOPLE

18:25.100 --> 18:27.433
AND TREAT YOU
WITH KINDNESS."

18:27.433 --> 18:31.233
- LIES.
THEY'RE GOING TO SCREW US.

18:39.733 --> 18:43.933
- "THE PILGRIMS INVITED
SQUANTO'S TRIBE TO A BIG FEAST.

18:43.933 --> 18:46.667
EVERYONE WAS HAPPY
WHEN THE INDIAN CHIEF ARRIVED."

18:49.033 --> 18:53.767
- [flat]
"WE'RE SO HAPPY."

18:53.767 --> 18:55.233
- "THEY EXCHANGED GIFTS,

18:55.233 --> 18:57.733
AND THE INDIAN CHIEF
EMBRACED THE PILGRIM GOVERNOR."

19:02.600 --> 19:06.700
[whispers]
GRANDPA, EMBRACE HIM.

19:06.700 --> 19:09.633
- LOOK, ALLY, SWEETIE,
THIS WAS CUTE AND EVERYTHING,

19:09.633 --> 19:12.700
BUT NOW IT STINKS.

19:12.700 --> 19:13.867
- IT DOESN'T STINK!

19:13.867 --> 19:16.333
THIS PLAY IS
A MACDOUGALL FAMILY TRADITION.

19:16.333 --> 19:18.167
- YES, AND WE'VE SEEN
OTHER KINDS OF TRADITIONS

19:18.167 --> 19:20.400
YOUR FAMILY ENJOYS.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.733
- MARIE,
PLEASE STOP ALREADY.

19:22.733 --> 19:24.567
- NO, NO. THAT'S OKAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

19:24.567 --> 19:26.467
IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET
EVERYTHING OUT IN THE OPEN.

19:26.467 --> 19:27.600
SO TELL ME, AMY,

19:27.600 --> 19:30.800
WHAT ELSE DID YOU FEED
THAT SNAKE, HUH?

19:30.800 --> 19:34.667
STRAY DOGS?
HITCHHIKERS?

19:34.667 --> 19:37.133
- OH, MY GOD.

19:37.133 --> 19:41.100
- YOUR FAMILY SCARES
THE HELL OUT OF ME!

19:41.100 --> 19:42.467
- OKAY.

19:42.467 --> 19:46.200
OKAY.
OKAY, ENOUGH.

19:46.200 --> 19:49.167
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

19:49.167 --> 19:50.600
WHEN I LEFT THE ROOM,

19:50.600 --> 19:52.700
EVERYBODY WAS LAUGHING,
AND IT WAS WONDERFUL.

19:52.700 --> 19:54.800
IT SHOWED ME THAT OUR FAMILY
COULD REALLY GET ALONG.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.300
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:56.300 --> 20:01.100
- PAT THE PSYCHO CHOKED A BIRD
WITH HER BARE HANDS.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.600
- WHAT?

20:02.600 --> 20:05.367
- A BIRD FLEW INTO THE WINDOW,
AND IT WAS REALLY HURT.

20:05.367 --> 20:06.533
- AND SHE MURDERED IT.

20:06.533 --> 20:08.233
- SHE PUT IT
OUT OF ITS MISERY.

20:08.233 --> 20:11.700
- OH, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

20:11.700 --> 20:12.567
SO?

20:12.567 --> 20:14.000
- SO?
- WELL, THANK YOU!

20:14.000 --> 20:15.567
[overlapping arguments]

20:15.567 --> 20:18.467
- THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
FIGHTING ABOUT?

20:18.467 --> 20:21.133
I MEAN,
WHAT WAS PAT SUPPOSED TO DO?

20:21.133 --> 20:24.033
PERFORM SURGERY?

20:24.033 --> 20:27.667
- YOU HAVE NEVER LIKED US.

20:32.333 --> 20:35.167
YOU TAKE
EVERY OPPORTUNITY YOU CAN

20:35.167 --> 20:37.133
TO GO AGAINST THE FAMILY.

20:37.133 --> 20:38.700
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
ACTUALLY,

20:38.700 --> 20:40.400
I CAN KIND OF SEE
DEBRA'S POINT.

20:40.400 --> 20:43.733
I MEAN,
THE BIRD WAS INJURED.

20:43.733 --> 20:45.333
- OH, NOW YOU THINK THAT?

20:45.333 --> 20:47.167
WHEN DEBRA SAYS IT, YOU LISTEN.
BUT WITH ME, YOU JUST FIGHT.

20:47.167 --> 20:51.167
WHAT IS WITH YOU?

20:52.333 --> 20:54.667
- IT'S A CONFUSING ISSUE!

20:58.500 --> 21:00.233
- YOU'RE OUT OF THE FAMILY.

21:00.233 --> 21:02.000
YOU, WHAT'S WITH YOUR WIFE?

21:02.000 --> 21:04.567
- HE'S RIGHT. WHY CAN'T YOU
JUST BE ON OUR SIDE?

21:04.567 --> 21:06.367
- IT'S NOT
ABOUT TAKING SIDES, RAY!

21:06.367 --> 21:07.900
IT'S VERY SAD WHAT HAPPENED
TO THAT BIRD,

21:07.900 --> 21:10.000
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE
TO RUIN EVERYTHING!

21:10.000 --> 21:12.100
- THAT BIRD WAS
ONE OF GOD'S CREATURES!

21:12.100 --> 21:17.067
THE GOD THESE PEOPLE
SUPPOSEDLY WORK FOR.

21:17.067 --> 21:19.367
BUT APPARENTLY, THAT LIFE
DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO THEM.

21:19.367 --> 21:21.700
IT WAS JUST A BIRD.

21:21.700 --> 21:23.000
WELL, MAYBE SO,

21:23.000 --> 21:24.433
BUT I HAPPEN TO THINK

21:24.433 --> 21:26.700
HE DESERVED A LOT BETTER
THAN HE GOT.

21:26.700 --> 21:30.400
- OKAY, EVERYONE!

21:30.400 --> 21:31.533
DINNER.

21:31.533 --> 21:34.000
- ALL RIGHT!
BREAK ME OFF A LEG THERE!

21:34.000 --> 21:38.767
[overlapping chattering]

21:38.767 --> 21:42.533
[peaceful piano tune]
