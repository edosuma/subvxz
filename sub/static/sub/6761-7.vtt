<i>Yo, yo, yo! Look sharp, ladies.
Only two more days to enter you</i>

01:53.988 --> 01:55.823
and your momma
in West Beverly High's

01:55.907 --> 01:58.659
annual fashion extravaganza for charity.

01:58.743 --> 02:02.330
Dress cool for your school in clothes
donated by your local merchants.

02:02.413 --> 02:04.915
<i>There's something for everyone,
from rubber bikinis</i>

02:04.999 --> 02:09.086
<i>to spacious evening gowns
for the big-boned woman.</i>

02:11.130 --> 02:13.883
Who would like to cover
this oh-so-elegant

02:13.966 --> 02:15.843
mother-daughter fashion show
on Saturday?

02:15.926 --> 02:18.429
No editorializing from the editor, please.

02:18.512 --> 02:19.597
Sorry.

02:19.680 --> 02:22.308
You know, it would be nice
if we could have somebody

02:22.391 --> 02:24.477
do a first person sort of thing.

02:26.020 --> 02:28.105
Why don't you do it, Andrea?

02:28.397 --> 02:31.734
Obviously, we need a writer
whose viewpoint is a little less slanted.

02:31.817 --> 02:33.694
Well, now,
correct me if I'm wrong, Miss Rye,

02:33.777 --> 02:36.363
but aren't we supposed to be learning
how to report here without bias?

02:36.447 --> 02:38.574
I'm not biased, I'm just not interested.

02:38.657 --> 02:40.618
I think it'd be good for you.

02:41.327 --> 02:44.788
May I have a word with you in my office?

02:49.918 --> 02:51.587
Are you out of your mind?

02:51.670 --> 02:54.256
What are you getting
so flustered about, huh?

02:54.339 --> 02:56.049
It'd be good for you
to let down your hair,

02:56.133 --> 02:58.802
take off your glasses,
wear something kind of stylish, huh?

02:58.886 --> 03:00.512
- What's wrong with my clothes?
- Nothing.

03:00.596 --> 03:02.598
I just thought it would be fun for you,
that's all.

03:02.681 --> 03:04.433
Yeah, well...

03:04.725 --> 03:07.686
Maybe for somebody whose mother
lives in Beverly Hills, Brandon.

03:07.769 --> 03:10.898
But I can't bring my mom to this.
I mean, it's one thing for me

03:10.981 --> 03:13.191
to lie about where I live,
it's a whole other thing for her to.

03:13.275 --> 03:14.985
That's right.
I didn't even think about the mom thing.

03:15.068 --> 03:16.820
- Yeah, well, you're not thinking, period.
- Wait a minute.

03:16.903 --> 03:19.281
Why don't you just say your mom's sick
and go with my mom?

03:19.364 --> 03:23.201
- That's a terrible idea.
- Is everything all right out here?

03:23.827 --> 03:25.287
Who would like to do a piece

03:25.370 --> 03:28.457
for a Jim Morrison "Dead Legends
of Rock 'n' Roll" column?

03:28.540 --> 03:31.501
- I think I hit a nerve.
- Good.

03:32.711 --> 03:36.006
Kelly Taylor, a girl who has everything.

03:37.007 --> 03:39.676
Great body. Great clothes.

03:40.969 --> 03:42.804
And a really great body.

03:43.555 --> 03:45.557
You already said great body.

04:04.409 --> 04:05.994
See you at lunchtime.

04:11.458 --> 04:13.918
So, nice clothes.

04:14.252 --> 04:17.755
Totally second string.
I saved the best for you and me.

04:18.089 --> 04:20.048
Really? You didn't have to do that.

04:20.132 --> 04:21.175
Come over after school.

04:21.259 --> 04:23.720
They're going to dazzle,
but I want us to destroy.

04:27.348 --> 04:30.393
This camera is the eyes
of West Beverly High, Scott.

04:30.893 --> 04:34.814
It goes anywhere and everywhere.
Anytime. Anyplace. Whatever it takes.

04:34.897 --> 04:36.733
What are you talking about?

04:37.567 --> 04:42.113
A truly behind-the-scenes look
at Kelly Taylor this weekend.

04:42.572 --> 04:45.408
Get over it.
You will never get in that dressing room.

04:45.825 --> 04:47.535
- Watch me.
- But...

04:48.369 --> 04:51.038
What do you think she'll do
when you get in there?

04:51.122 --> 04:53.082
I think she'll get off on it.

04:54.917 --> 04:58.087
God, Nina, I'm just so happy.

04:58.963 --> 05:03.884
For the first time since I can remember,
I'm actually feeling content.

05:06.137 --> 05:09.390
I don't seem to have that empty feeling.

05:10.766 --> 05:13.436
You know, like there should be
something more,

05:13.519 --> 05:17.523
that there's something eluding me,
just out of reach.

05:20.359 --> 05:22.069
It's finally coming together.

05:22.153 --> 05:26.323
And I say to myself, whatever it took
to get myself here, it was worth it.

05:27.616 --> 05:31.328
And the mistakes weren't mistakes,
they were lessons, right?

05:31.412 --> 05:33.080
Well, of course.

05:33.164 --> 05:36.458
I mean, I have a beautiful daughter
whom I adore.

05:37.042 --> 05:39.545
I have this wonderful new man
in my life.

05:39.628 --> 05:42.923
You couldn't do any better than Don,
in every department.

05:43.007 --> 05:47.469
I know. And the funny thing is,
I'm not even looking for sex anymore.

05:47.553 --> 05:51.390
All I want is companionship.
A feeling of family.

05:51.724 --> 05:55.519
That's why it's so important that
Kelly likes him and respects him.

05:55.769 --> 05:57.813
Well, if you do, she will.

05:57.896 --> 06:00.149
Well, you know how she got along
with Jack.

06:00.232 --> 06:02.025
And he tried to be a father to her.

06:03.318 --> 06:06.238
But the point is, she's going to be
out of the house in two years anyway,

06:06.321 --> 06:08.574
- so why...
- Hi, Mom. Hi, Nina.

06:08.657 --> 06:10.701
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, Kelly.

06:10.784 --> 06:12.327
Brenda, this is my mom.

06:12.411 --> 06:13.537
- Jackie.
- Hi.

06:13.620 --> 06:14.872
- And Nina.
- Hi.

06:14.955 --> 06:17.082
- Come here, gorgeous.
- Sit.

06:18.709 --> 06:21.420
Kelly, you didn't tell me
Brenda was such a knockout.

06:21.503 --> 06:23.463
The two of you must be
dangerous together.

06:23.547 --> 06:24.840
Lethal.

06:25.173 --> 06:28.301
- So what have you two been up to?
- Oh, killing the afternoon.

06:28.385 --> 06:30.887
Your mother has a date
with Prince Don tonight.

06:30.971 --> 06:34.808
- So she's trying to conserve her energy.
- Oh, shut up.

06:36.226 --> 06:39.187
- Kelly tells me you're from Minneapolis.
- Yeah.

06:39.479 --> 06:42.274
Midwestern girls do very well
in this town, Brenda.

06:42.357 --> 06:43.984
Mom grew up in Ohio.

06:44.067 --> 06:47.153
Well, actually I modeled
for a couple of years in New York

06:47.237 --> 06:49.823
before I came out here,
which is where I met Kelly's dad,

06:49.906 --> 06:51.533
Prince Charming number one.

06:51.616 --> 06:53.201
Mom, I wanted to show Brenda
the clothes.

06:53.285 --> 06:55.787
Oh, yes! The Farley, you bet.
You'll love it.

06:55.870 --> 06:58.873
God, sometimes I feel
like a fashion addict.

07:09.300 --> 07:11.886
Hi, sweetheart, what do you think?

07:11.970 --> 07:14.305
Mom, you are wearing a jacket
over that, aren't you?

07:14.389 --> 07:15.515
No.

07:16.266 --> 07:17.934
Well, I guess it delivers a message.

07:18.017 --> 07:19.853
And what is that supposed to mean?

07:19.936 --> 07:23.314
Nothing, you asked my opinion.
I think it's a little much, that's all.

07:23.398 --> 07:26.985
Kelly, you're just like your dad.
You are so critical.

07:27.861 --> 07:29.946
Mom, you were drinking today with Nina,
weren't you?

07:30.029 --> 07:31.197
No comment.

07:31.281 --> 07:34.867
- So, what is that all about?
- It's not about anything.

07:35.118 --> 07:38.162
I just can't believe it. I mean,
she is supposed to be your friend.

07:38.246 --> 07:41.040
What is the problem?
Wasn't I a charmer to Brenda today?

07:41.124 --> 07:43.626
Mother, charm is something
that you don't have to worry about.

07:43.710 --> 07:45.586
Then don't you worry.

07:46.170 --> 07:48.506
Now don't forget to lock up
and turn on the alarm.

07:48.589 --> 07:50.967
I think I'm gonna be at Don's tonight.

08:10.152 --> 08:13.447
I think I'm gonna have some
microwave popcorn for dinner tonight.

08:13.531 --> 08:15.074
You will not.

08:15.199 --> 08:17.243
Well, that's what Kelly's having.

08:17.326 --> 08:20.663
Well, then I feel sorry for her.
Doesn't her mother cook?

08:20.746 --> 08:23.582
- I kind of doubt it.
- Seriously?

08:24.291 --> 08:25.835
Yes, seriously.

08:26.752 --> 08:28.462
Oh, Mom, don't give me that look like,

08:28.546 --> 08:30.881
"This town is crazy
and we're the only normal people in it."

08:30.965 --> 08:32.967
Well, you said it, I didn't.

08:33.049 --> 08:35.553
You know, Kelly's mom remembers
what it was like to be my age.

08:35.635 --> 08:37.429
- Why can't you?
- Oh, but I do.

08:37.513 --> 08:40.933
And you're the lucky beneficiary
of my years of experience.

08:41.015 --> 08:42.934
Well, maybe my life
will be different than yours.

08:43.018 --> 08:45.062
Well, honey,
when you start living that life,

08:45.145 --> 08:48.357
you can have microwave popcorn
morning, noon and night.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.776
But tonight we're having chicken diablo
for supper.

08:50.859 --> 08:54.488
And the voice of experience advises you
to get it while you can.

09:13.173 --> 09:14.633
- Mom?
- Kelly.

09:15.092 --> 09:16.593
Mom, what is it?

09:16.677 --> 09:18.971
Don and I broke up last night.

09:19.137 --> 09:21.890
- What happened?
- Well, obviously I'm not enough for him.

09:21.974 --> 09:25.143
He wants to see other women.
Younger ones, I'm sure.

09:25.227 --> 09:28.772
- Well, it's his loss.
- Look, do me a favor and call Eileen

09:29.231 --> 09:31.608
and cancel my hair appointment.

09:33.986 --> 09:36.238
Call Bill Hutkins at the accounting firm

09:36.321 --> 09:38.448
and tell him we'll have to reschedule
next week.

09:38.532 --> 09:41.326
I'm supposed to be playing tennis
with Alison Freemont.

09:41.410 --> 09:43.995
You know the number,
look it up in my book.

09:44.079 --> 09:46.998
Tell her I'm sick,
I can't even talk to her today.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.419
Kelly! Kelly, get up here!

09:53.255 --> 09:54.673
Did you dump this?

09:55.465 --> 09:57.801
- No.
- I demand an explanation.

09:58.093 --> 09:59.594
You said that you stopped.

09:59.678 --> 10:02.889
Don't you tell me what I should
or should not be doing.

10:02.973 --> 10:05.058
I am a grown woman. And I will not have

10:05.141 --> 10:07.602
my 16-year-old daughter
play cop in my own house.

10:07.686 --> 10:09.813
Mom, I think you should call
your sponsor.

10:09.896 --> 10:12.565
Well, thanks for the advice,
little Miss AA.

10:12.649 --> 10:14.317
I was just trying to help.

10:14.401 --> 10:17.362
Then please just do
those three tiny favors for me

10:17.445 --> 10:20.281
so I can rest up and be
my gracious, witty self

10:20.365 --> 10:23.243
for all of your friends
at the luncheon tomorrow.

10:26.204 --> 10:29.332
How many other mothers
volunteer their time like I do?

10:42.595 --> 10:44.681
Okay. See you at school. Bye.

10:48.351 --> 10:52.438
Honey, don't you have something
that's a little nicer to wear?

10:53.356 --> 10:55.608
Mother, this is nice.

10:56.359 --> 10:59.654
You know, Kelly's mom has
such a great sense of fashion.

11:00.154 --> 11:02.115
Did I ever tell you
that she used to be a model?

11:02.198 --> 11:06.077
- About 50 times.
- Why do you dislike her so much?

11:06.369 --> 11:09.413
Honey, I don't even know her.
But from what you've described,

11:09.497 --> 11:11.749
I suspect we don't have
a lot in common.

11:12.166 --> 11:14.585
- You're so judgmental.
- No, I'm not.

11:14.669 --> 11:17.088
I'm just saying that we're different.

11:17.171 --> 11:20.466
But you're saying that your different
is better than her different, aren't you?

11:20.549 --> 11:23.844
- Why are you picking a fight with me?
- Look, I am not fighting.

11:23.928 --> 11:26.472
It's just that, you know,
you are so closed-minded.

11:26.555 --> 11:27.682
We move to a new city,

11:27.765 --> 11:29.809
and just because people
don't eat dinner right at 6:00

11:29.892 --> 11:32.144
and because they wear
expensive clothes and drive nice cars,

11:32.228 --> 11:34.188
you think there's something
wrong with them.

11:34.271 --> 11:37.525
Well, I can't change who I am
to suit the neighborhood.

11:37.858 --> 11:40.194
- Brenda, let's go.
- I'm coming.

11:40.402 --> 11:43.155
- Look, Mom, I just wish that...
- What?

11:44.782 --> 11:46.825
Nothing. I gotta go. I'm late for school.

11:46.909 --> 11:48.702
- Take a muffin.
- No.

11:55.459 --> 11:57.628
You know, I'm thinking
about wearing it back...

11:57.711 --> 12:00.047
I think it's the blonde hair
that gets me the most.

12:00.130 --> 12:02.841
I have this incredible urge to just sniff it.

12:03.008 --> 12:05.302
You better not be recording any of this.

12:05.386 --> 12:07.805
- Hey, Kelly! Kelly Taylor!
- What?

12:08.263 --> 12:11.308
How about a pre-show interview
for the video yearbook?

12:11.391 --> 12:15.229
- Sorry. I've just got too much to do.
- What about tomorrow morning?

12:15.312 --> 12:18.315
- Maybe.
- I'll see you in the dressing room.

12:23.737 --> 12:25.948
Wow, look at you.

12:26.990 --> 12:29.576
I used to think that girls who brushed
their hair in the middle of class

12:29.660 --> 12:31.995
were immature, insecure
and unhygienic.

12:32.079 --> 12:34.790
Now I realize
it is clearly a matter of necessity.

12:34.873 --> 12:35.958
Well, it looks good.

12:36.041 --> 12:37.501
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:39.753 --> 12:42.339
You know,
you really got to me yesterday.

12:42.464 --> 12:44.925
So, does that mean
you want to take me up on my offer?

12:45.008 --> 12:47.052
- If it still holds.
- Sure.

12:47.302 --> 12:49.596
- Come on over for dinner.
- Wait, what about your mom?

12:49.679 --> 12:53.391
- I mean, it's such an imposition.
- Trust me, my mother loves company.

12:53.475 --> 12:55.268
- 6:00, okay?
- Great.

12:55.644 --> 12:57.854
And thanks, Brandon.

12:58.230 --> 13:01.775
I mean, it's a great opportunity
to be able to write about something

13:01.858 --> 13:04.361
outside the realm
of my normal experience.

13:04.444 --> 13:06.696
Yeah, it's a real character builder.

13:07.030 --> 13:08.865
See you tonight.

13:11.034 --> 13:13.078
Brenda! Hey, you want a ride?

13:13.161 --> 13:14.871
I would love one.

13:15.288 --> 13:17.415
So do you care if we hang out
at your house today?

13:17.499 --> 13:20.585
Why? It's such a drag
compared to yours.

13:20.794 --> 13:23.213
My mom's kind of getting on my nerves.

13:23.338 --> 13:26.341
Kelly, your mom is so cool.
You've nothing to crib about.

13:26.424 --> 13:30.136
- Well, you're not her daughter.
- Yeah, well, sometimes I wish I was.

13:30.220 --> 13:33.097
It would be great to have a mom
that's more like a friend.

13:33.515 --> 13:35.225
Yeah, it has its moments.

13:35.308 --> 13:38.311
And not just any friend.
A friend who loves clothes

13:38.394 --> 13:41.189
and buys them for you because she
knows how important they are to you.

13:41.856 --> 13:44.067
Who you can talk to about guys,

13:44.150 --> 13:46.861
and not have to leave out
any of the good parts.

13:46.945 --> 13:49.238
Who treats you like an equal.

13:49.447 --> 13:53.076
Kelly, I don't think you know
how lucky you really are.

13:53.534 --> 13:57.163
Well, maybe it looks that way,
but sometimes it can be tough.

13:57.413 --> 14:00.875
I mean, I have problems
that you don't have to worry about.

14:01.167 --> 14:04.128
Like what?
So many clothes, so little time.

14:05.213 --> 14:06.380
Yeah.

14:07.423 --> 14:10.593
So do you think your mom would care
if I stayed for dinner?

14:10.676 --> 14:13.262
- She'll make you clean your plate.
- Good.

14:15.348 --> 14:19.602
- Something smells like anchovies.
- Mom, you know I hate anchovies.

14:19.685 --> 14:24.023
There's just a trace amount in here.
For flavor. Did you see me put that in?

14:24.106 --> 14:27.276
No. It's just that I developed
this extremely acute sense of smell

14:27.360 --> 14:29.779
after I got my nose corrected.

14:30.488 --> 14:32.281
You've got to be kidding.

14:32.365 --> 14:34.700
- I'm going to order out, okay?
- You are not!

14:34.784 --> 14:36.494
Brenda, the only reason
we ever order out

14:36.577 --> 14:39.288
is because my mother
is a walking disaster in the kitchen.

14:39.371 --> 14:42.083
Is the olive oil in the salad dressing
first press?

14:42.166 --> 14:44.543
I think it's time for you girls
to set the table.

14:44.627 --> 14:47.171
There'll be six of us. Your brother's
bringing a guest for dinner.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.797
- Who?
- Andrea.

14:50.007 --> 14:51.717
Andrea Zuckerman?

14:57.973 --> 14:59.058
Anybody for more?

14:59.141 --> 15:01.685
No, it's wonderful.
You're a terrific cook, Ms Walsh.

15:01.769 --> 15:04.563
Well, thank you. You hear that, Brenda?

15:05.981 --> 15:09.401
You know, you should try using
fresh oregano in the sauce next time.

15:09.485 --> 15:10.527
It would be really killer.

15:10.611 --> 15:12.738
Thank you, Kelly.
I'll take that into consideration.

15:13.155 --> 15:16.283
Mom. I wanted to ask you something

15:16.366 --> 15:19.536
and I wanted Brenda to be here,
'cause it kind of affects her, too.

15:19.620 --> 15:20.996
Oh, what's that?

15:21.163 --> 15:25.125
Well, you see, Andrea's writing
this first-person account for the paper

15:25.209 --> 15:27.836
about the mother-daughter
fashion show tomorrow,

15:27.920 --> 15:30.214
but her mother has to work. Right?

15:30.297 --> 15:32.925
Right. And so
Brandon thought that maybe

15:33.008 --> 15:36.178
I could join you and Brenda tomorrow,
if you don't mind.

15:36.970 --> 15:40.265
Wait a second.
What mother-daughter fashion show?

15:41.099 --> 15:43.852
- I haven't had the time...
- You know, the charity thing.

15:46.605 --> 15:48.940
- Didn't you tell her?
- Not yet.

15:49.816 --> 15:51.568
First I've heard of it.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.905
What about you, Kelly?
Are you going with your mother?

15:54.988 --> 15:58.950
Well, my mom is, kind of,
the chairperson of the event.

15:59.451 --> 16:00.619
I see.

16:01.411 --> 16:03.788
Brenda, why didn't you tell us?

16:05.207 --> 16:07.834
- I guess I forgot.
- Look, it's okay.

16:07.959 --> 16:10.587
It wasn't a great idea for a story anyway.

16:10.670 --> 16:14.257
Oh, no, Andrea. I'd love to have you
join us. In fact, I insist.

16:19.137 --> 16:22.015
I mean, is she somehow embarrassed
about me? Is that what it is?

16:22.098 --> 16:23.850
No, of course not.

16:24.184 --> 16:25.518
She's out of her element here.

16:25.602 --> 16:27.479
She just doesn't quite know
how to behave.

16:27.562 --> 16:30.356
Well, she's so enamored
of Kelly Taylor's mother.

16:30.440 --> 16:32.108
I just don't know
what she expects of me.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.818
Hey, don't take it so personally.

16:33.902 --> 16:35.987
Well, you have to admit
it was pretty personal, Jim.

16:36.070 --> 16:38.281
I mean, Brenda only has one mother.

16:38.364 --> 16:41.784
Would you give her a chance to make it
up to you? Daughter to mother?

16:41.868 --> 16:44.078
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:46.122 --> 16:49.042
I'll just leave you two alone.

16:55.923 --> 16:57.091
Can I help?

16:57.884 --> 17:00.011
No, no, everything's done.

17:03.765 --> 17:08.019
Mom, I'm really sorry.

17:10.061 --> 17:13.273
I didn't think it would be anything
that you wanted to do.

17:13.357 --> 17:16.777
Brenda, I don't care
about the stupid fashion show.

17:17.236 --> 17:20.573
But what is it about me
you suddenly find so embarrassing?

17:20.740 --> 17:21.824
Nothing.

17:21.907 --> 17:23.826
Look, I know I might be
a little more down-to-earth

17:23.910 --> 17:26.078
than some of the other mothers
in this town.

17:26.162 --> 17:29.290
But trust me, Brenda,
that's nothing to be ashamed of.

17:30.041 --> 17:31.917
Or to be so proud of.

17:34.503 --> 17:39.008
Mom, you may not believe this,

17:40.426 --> 17:42.553
but you were more Beverly Hills
in Minneapolis

17:42.636 --> 17:44.638
than you are in Beverly Hills.

17:44.930 --> 17:47.516
I mean, if this fashion show
was back home,

17:47.600 --> 17:49.769
you would probably be running it.

17:51.645 --> 17:53.439
Maybe you're right.

17:53.981 --> 17:57.067
Maybe I have been overreacting
to this place.

17:58.819 --> 18:01.280
So, are you coming with me tomorrow?

18:02.865 --> 18:05.576
Honey, there's nothing I'd rather do.

18:06.076 --> 18:08.996
- Let's go overreact together, okay?
- Okay.

18:17.004 --> 18:19.381
Damn it, Mom. You locked the deadbolt.

18:21.383 --> 18:22.509
Mom!

18:24.261 --> 18:25.387
Mom!

18:31.852 --> 18:35.564
Oh, Max. Max, get away. Go away.

18:36.064 --> 18:37.983
Get out of my face.

18:48.201 --> 18:49.328
Mom?

18:50.871 --> 18:52.039
Mom?

18:53.081 --> 18:55.292
Mom, Mom!

18:55.792 --> 18:58.086
Mom, get up. Jackie, wake up.

18:59.421 --> 19:02.507
- Mom!
- Leave me alone, I'm sleeping.

19:12.726 --> 19:15.103
Thanks, baby. I'm really tired.

19:20.150 --> 19:22.819
Hang up everything nice, okay?

19:23.153 --> 19:24.738
All right, Mom.

19:25.989 --> 19:28.742
Just get some rest for tomorrow, okay?

19:40.920 --> 19:42.964
Hello, Nina, it's Kelly.

19:43.506 --> 19:46.801
Fine. No, not fine.
I can't get my mom out of bed.

19:48.052 --> 19:49.804
Yes, I know she broke up with Don,

19:49.888 --> 19:53.141
but the fashion show starts in two hours
and she's a total mess.

19:53.224 --> 19:56.728
I haven't seen her this bad
since she went into Timber Hills.

19:56.853 --> 19:58.605
Mom. Mom, get up.

19:59.063 --> 20:03.484
No, please just five more minutes,
just five more itty-bitty minutes.

20:04.193 --> 20:07.447
I cannot believe that you just sat there
and you let her drink yesterday.

20:07.530 --> 20:09.574
- Who is that?
- It's Nina.

20:11.784 --> 20:14.704
My life is falling apart
and I'm supposed to be hosting

20:14.787 --> 20:17.415
a fashion show. I'll call you later.

20:20.751 --> 20:22.295
Come on.
Hurry up, we're gonna be late.

20:22.378 --> 20:23.838
Don't worry, everything will be fine.

20:35.933 --> 20:37.685
Mom, what are you doing?

20:39.103 --> 20:40.771
I just need a jump-start.

20:40.855 --> 20:44.150
You know that Jack would cut off
your alimony if you start using again.

20:44.233 --> 20:45.985
So, who are you? His lawyer?

20:46.068 --> 20:48.279
No, but you wouldn't want him
to find out, would you?

20:48.362 --> 20:50.156
So, don't tell him!

20:50.281 --> 20:51.907
Kel, what are you doing to me?

20:51.991 --> 20:54.660
I'm trying my damnedest to be
Miss Congeniality by noon

20:54.743 --> 20:57.413
- and you're threatening me.
- It's not a threat,

20:57.496 --> 21:01.167
- it's just that you promised.
- Okay, I'm sorry, all right?

21:01.417 --> 21:03.711
But don't hang me for one bad night.

21:03.794 --> 21:07.965
I deserve a little love and support
from my own daughter, don't you think?

21:10.926 --> 21:13.429
Mom, my earrings are over there.
Can you get them, please?

21:13.512 --> 21:16.432
Sure, Donna.
Get into your first outfit, please.

21:18.017 --> 21:20.019
You want the gold ones, Donna?

21:32.197 --> 21:36.201
- Mom, you look great.
- Well, I guess it's about time.

21:36.285 --> 21:39.705
- Oh, sweetheart, you look outrageous.
- Really?

21:39.788 --> 21:43.292
Oh, yes. Where did Kelly's mom
get these clothes? I mean,

21:43.375 --> 21:46.920
- I don't think I want to give this back.
- She's so amazing, Mom.

21:47.004 --> 21:49.756
I can't wait for you to meet her.
If she ever gets here.

21:49.840 --> 21:52.718
- Well, I can't believe they're this late.
- I wonder how much this costs.

21:52.801 --> 21:55.679
- Not that I'd ever consider buying it.
- Why not? You deserve it.

21:55.762 --> 21:58.682
- Could you just help me clasp this?
- Yeah.

22:03.520 --> 22:06.440
Smart and beautiful. It's just not fair.

22:06.523 --> 22:09.234
Get out of here. It's just the dress.

22:09.651 --> 22:14.322
- No, really, Andrea. You look gorgeous.
- Really? Thanks.

22:19.911 --> 22:22.539
I didn't want to forget that moment.

22:28.211 --> 22:31.381
And now for the piece de resistance.

22:33.174 --> 22:34.300
Wow.

22:36.094 --> 22:37.387
I don't know, I...

22:37.470 --> 22:41.099
- I think I may kill myself without these.
- That's okay. I like them.

22:41.182 --> 22:45.520
- I think they're very you.
- Yeah, well, I kind of like them, too.

22:46.688 --> 22:49.065
Boy, there sure are
a lot of women around here.

22:49.149 --> 22:52.443
Dad, there's nothing
but women around here.

22:52.527 --> 22:54.946
A lot of really beautiful women.

22:55.321 --> 22:57.907
I think we should grab our seats
before someone figures out

22:57.991 --> 23:00.201
that we're not supposed to be here.

23:03.705 --> 23:05.039
Good idea.

23:23.307 --> 23:26.352
I'm looking for Kelly Taylor.
I'm supposed to interview her

23:26.435 --> 23:29.355
- before the fashion show.
- She's not in here.

23:29.772 --> 23:32.066
Hey, where is Jackie, anyway?

23:32.316 --> 23:33.860
I cannot believe that we are so late.

23:33.943 --> 23:36.112
- Kelly, I don't want to hear it.
- There you are.

23:36.445 --> 23:37.905
- Five minutes.
- All right.

23:37.989 --> 23:40.950
Look, I've got to find a bathroom.
So you tell everybody I'll be right there.

23:41.033 --> 23:42.159
Mom.

23:42.326 --> 23:45.830
Okay, mother-daughter fashion show,
charitable cause

23:46.455 --> 23:49.875
- or just another superficial sleaze fest?
- Yes. No!

23:51.711 --> 23:53.462
Well, which is it?

24:18.320 --> 24:19.446
Excuse me.

24:24.451 --> 24:26.245
Mom, Kelly just got here
with her mother

24:26.328 --> 24:28.497
and I want to introduce you, okay?

24:30.290 --> 24:31.917
Brenda, I'd be glad to meet her.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.045
I saw her come in with Kelly
just a few minutes ago.

24:36.296 --> 24:39.383
- Sorry I'm late, everybody!
- So nice of you to make it.

24:39.466 --> 24:41.385
- There she is.
- Okay, now here are your numbers.

24:41.468 --> 24:44.638
Please, everybody, stay in order, or
else I'll be announcing the wrong outfits.

24:44.721 --> 24:46.557
- And names, of course.
- Come on.

24:46.640 --> 24:48.767
Brenda, maybe I should meet her
another time.

24:48.850 --> 24:51.144
- Why?
- Well, honey, she's terribly busy and...

24:51.228 --> 24:54.147
Won't you even make an effort, Mom?
I really want you guys to be friends.

24:54.231 --> 24:56.817
- I know you do, but I...
- Come on.

24:57.901 --> 24:59.027
Jackie, hi.

24:59.111 --> 25:01.613
- Why, darling, you look fabulous.
- Thanks.

25:01.697 --> 25:03.949
I want to introduce you to my mother.
This is Cindy Walsh.

25:04.032 --> 25:05.909
- How do you do?
- Hello, Cindy.

25:05.992 --> 25:08.286
Brenda's told me so much about you.

25:08.370 --> 25:11.957
Good luck out there.
You guys both look fabulous.

25:14.251 --> 25:17.420
- I... I guess she's pretty busy.
- It's okay.

25:17.796 --> 25:19.798
Okay, now. Pay attention
to your numbers, everybody.

25:19.881 --> 25:21.716
We're about to begin.

25:27.764 --> 25:29.891
<i>Welcome to the 15th annual</i>

25:29.975 --> 25:33.144
<i>West Beverly High
mother-daughter fashion show.</i>

25:38.525 --> 25:41.277
- That's a mother?
- Kelly's mother.

25:42.112 --> 25:44.114
<i>My name is Jackie Taylor.</i>

25:44.197 --> 25:45.824
<i>The fashions you will be seeing tonight</i>

25:45.907 --> 25:48.076
<i>are on generous loan
from local merchants.</i>

25:48.159 --> 25:53.164
<i>And, of course, everything is for sale.
But then, what isn't?</i>

25:54.165 --> 25:58.628
<i>With no further elaboration, I give you
the mother-daughter fashion plates</i>

25:58.711 --> 26:00.713
<i>of West Beverly High.</i>

26:00.797 --> 26:03.758
<i>Stepping into the bright lights
of high fashion, we have</i>

26:03.841 --> 26:07.845
<i>Celia and Nadine Krauss,
wearing clothes and accessories</i>

26:07.929 --> 26:10.473
<i>from Sonia's California Closet.</i>

26:17.689 --> 26:19.273
<i>Oh, loosen up, ladies.</i>

26:19.357 --> 26:23.444
<i>I'm supposed to be describing
this evening wear as "dangerous."</i>

26:23.736 --> 26:26.114
- I think that was a little bit rude.
- Yeah.

26:26.197 --> 26:29.826
<i>Let's see.
I now take you on a fashion safari.</i>

26:30.284 --> 26:32.203
<i>No, that's not right.</i>

26:37.083 --> 26:39.877
<i>Excuse me,
that spot is right in my eyes.</i>

26:39.961 --> 26:43.089
<i>I mean, they wouldn't even let us in
here to rehearse the lighting</i>

26:43.172 --> 26:46.300
<i>without charging us for a full day.
Do you believe that?</i>

26:48.260 --> 26:52.598
<i>From the office to the opera,
these Alex Kallas originals</i>

26:52.682 --> 26:55.059
<i>merge practicality and panache.</i>

26:55.393 --> 26:57.687
<i>Hello, Lisa and Linda Burns.</i>

27:06.195 --> 27:08.739
<i>Don't we look marvelous.</i>

27:08.823 --> 27:10.241
She is being rude.

27:13.786 --> 27:16.330
<i>Shake it, ladies. Shake it.</i>

27:17.581 --> 27:20.542
I think she must be on something
out there.

27:21.252 --> 27:25.255
<i>From the wilds of Minneapolis,
welcome Cindy and Brenda Walsh,</i>

27:25.339 --> 27:28.050
<i>who are joined by Angela Zuckerman...</i>

27:28.759 --> 27:32.513
<i>Andrea Zuckerman, all in evening wear
designed by Farley.</i>

27:45.150 --> 27:47.945
- Wow, they look great.
- I don't believe it.

27:57.287 --> 28:00.749
Isn't that the girl who was
at our house for dinner last night?

28:00.832 --> 28:02.709
I'm not sure anymore.

28:02.793 --> 28:07.214
<i>I don't know if any of you remember,
but about 18 years ago,</i>

28:07.714 --> 28:10.425
<i>I was the Farley girl.</i>

28:10.717 --> 28:12.719
<i>Now that's back when I was about 20</i>

28:12.803 --> 28:16.223
<i>and that's back
when 20 was still considered young.</i>

28:16.681 --> 28:19.768
<i>Of course now,
it's positively over the hill.</i>

28:20.352 --> 28:24.564
<i>Donna and Nancy Martin
are wearing beachwear</i>

28:24.648 --> 28:26.942
<i>from Susie's Surf Shop.</i>

28:29.069 --> 28:31.696
<i>Now, men, it's a funny thing.</i>

28:31.780 --> 28:35.617
<i>Men have modeling careers
well into their 50s.</i>

28:36.952 --> 28:40.705
<i>But then it's a man's world, isn't it?</i>

28:43.917 --> 28:47.045
<i>I wonder if any of you
movers and shakers out there</i>

28:47.128 --> 28:51.091
<i>would care to tell me exactly why
women get so exploited in this town?</i>

28:52.467 --> 28:54.803
<i>I imagine there must be
one or two of you</i>

28:54.886 --> 28:58.264
<i>who could still stand to be
with a woman after 30.</i>

28:59.224 --> 29:01.059
<i>But maybe I'm wrong.</i>

29:08.525 --> 29:11.110
<i>Would you get the damn spot
out of my eyes?</i>

29:15.365 --> 29:18.242
- Kelly, is she all right?
- No.

29:20.662 --> 29:21.829
<i>Here we are.</i>

29:21.913 --> 29:26.084
<i>From the wilds of Minneapolis,
welcome Cindy and Brenda Walsh,</i>

29:26.167 --> 29:28.586
<i>and Andrea Zuckerman.</i>

29:28.669 --> 29:29.962
But she's already said that.

29:30.046 --> 29:32.423
<i>All in evening wear by Farley.</i>

29:33.257 --> 29:35.426
Mom, you said that already.

29:35.760 --> 29:37.136
<i>Hello!</i>

29:37.220 --> 29:40.223
<i>Cindy and Brenda and Andrea.</i>

29:40.723 --> 29:42.642
She doesn't even realize
what she's saying.

29:42.725 --> 29:45.061
<i>Please, you're not going to let me die
out here, are you?</i>

29:45.144 --> 29:46.395
Oh, no!

29:50.274 --> 29:53.527
<i>Okay. Next.</i>

29:55.655 --> 29:57.156
Damn it, Mom.

29:58.449 --> 29:59.659
Kelly.

30:03.329 --> 30:04.455
Kelly, stop.

30:04.538 --> 30:08.667
- Brenda, just leave me alone.
- Kelly, please. Kelly.

30:08.751 --> 30:10.086
Tell me what's going on.

30:10.169 --> 30:12.588
Brenda, I tried to tell you,
but you wouldn't listen.

30:12.671 --> 30:14.507
- When?
- It doesn't matter.

30:14.590 --> 30:16.717
You probably wouldn't have
believed me anyway.

30:16.800 --> 30:19.136
You think my mom's so amazing,

30:19.428 --> 30:21.847
but can't you see it's just an act?

30:23.015 --> 30:25.100
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

30:25.768 --> 30:27.686
You must think I'm so stupid.

30:28.771 --> 30:29.855
No.

30:34.985 --> 30:37.112
But you, like, can't tell.

30:37.363 --> 30:39.907
She does a great job of hiding it.

30:41.116 --> 30:44.578
She was supposed to have quit using
over a year ago.

30:44.870 --> 30:47.498
But the past week has been pretty bad.

30:48.624 --> 30:50.042
And this...

30:51.960 --> 30:54.213
I can't go back to school on Monday.

30:54.505 --> 30:56.632
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't.

30:57.132 --> 31:00.552
Not after she made
such a fool of herself up there.

31:00.844 --> 31:02.888
It's going to be all over the place.

31:02.971 --> 31:05.557
- Kelly, people forget.
- But I don't.

31:06.350 --> 31:08.769
And I can't forgive her, either.

31:10.562 --> 31:14.524
- Brenda, my mother doesn't love me.
- Kelly, that is not true.

31:15.817 --> 31:17.527
What do you know?

31:17.611 --> 31:21.490
You have no idea what it's like
to live with an alcoholic.

31:21.573 --> 31:25.202
You probably think that everybody's
family is just perfect like yours.

31:25.285 --> 31:27.329
My family is not perfect.

31:28.371 --> 31:30.582
Well, at least they're sober.

31:30.665 --> 31:34.085
And right now, that would be
perfect enough for me.

31:36.504 --> 31:38.506
I just don't know what to do.

31:38.590 --> 31:42.928
I mean, I can't go back home
and live with her like this.

31:44.262 --> 31:47.140
I know what happens. It only gets worse.

32:00.987 --> 32:03.490
My cousin Carrie is an alcoholic.

32:03.740 --> 32:04.824
She is?

32:05.700 --> 32:09.204
Well, I never told you because...
Well, frankly it's not your business,

32:09.287 --> 32:12.207
but I know what a time
she's been through.

32:12.707 --> 32:14.792
Every day is a struggle.

32:15.919 --> 32:17.587
Same for my mom.

32:18.129 --> 32:19.589
Carrie got treatment.

32:19.672 --> 32:22.842
She told everybody
she was getting her appendix out.

32:23.176 --> 32:25.803
My mom said that
she was going to the spa.

32:25.887 --> 32:29.223
It's ridiculous to have to make up stories
about something like this.

32:29.307 --> 32:31.976
I mean, it's nothing to be ashamed of.
It's a disease.

32:32.060 --> 32:35.980
And when you're sick, you get help.
No excuses or apologies are necessary.

32:36.064 --> 32:39.817
I'm sorry, but I am just so tired
of it being my problem.

32:40.401 --> 32:42.570
I have enough problems of my own.

32:43.112 --> 32:45.198
Kelly, can I tell you something?

32:46.282 --> 32:49.410
- What?
- I think you're totally amazing.

32:50.077 --> 32:51.662
I mean, I look at you at school

32:51.746 --> 32:54.749
and I think that you have
the most perfect life and...

32:54.832 --> 32:56.792
In a million years,
I never would have suspected

32:56.876 --> 32:59.045
that you had one single problem.

32:59.128 --> 33:01.005
Well, obviously I do.

33:01.839 --> 33:03.090
I know.

33:04.508 --> 33:08.179
And that's why I think you're the
strongest person I've ever met.

33:08.346 --> 33:11.974
I mean, you always look like
you're having more fun than anybody.

33:12.058 --> 33:13.642
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:15.186 --> 33:16.771
Sometimes I am.

33:18.230 --> 33:20.399
And sometimes I know that I'm not.

33:23.360 --> 33:25.362
Can I be honest with you?

33:25.446 --> 33:26.614
Sure.

33:27.573 --> 33:29.658
I never knew you were so pretty.

33:30.659 --> 33:31.911
Thanks.

33:36.373 --> 33:39.460
- Is he gonna stop playing that?
- Jim!

33:40.836 --> 33:42.212
Excuse me.

33:44.798 --> 33:47.843
- Isn't there another button there?
- I don't know. I can't see one.

33:47.926 --> 33:50.054
It's this one, I think it's stuck.

33:50.596 --> 33:53.015
I need something else to get it.

33:53.307 --> 33:55.726
Jim, I have one very troubled girl
down there

33:55.809 --> 33:59.313
- and you are not helping the situation.
- I know, Mom. We're in cha-cha hell.

33:59.396 --> 34:02.316
There's something wrong
with the rhythm section.

34:02.566 --> 34:04.193
There. Problem solved.

34:08.614 --> 34:11.074
If that's my mom, I'm not here, okay?

34:11.158 --> 34:13.201
Kelly, don't you even want to talk to her?

34:13.284 --> 34:15.495
I have nothing more to say.

34:23.085 --> 34:24.838
- Hello, Cindy.
- Hi.

34:25.130 --> 34:27.674
I wondered if Kelly might be here?

34:28.717 --> 34:30.761
- Jackie, hi.
- Hi, Brenda.

34:30.844 --> 34:33.889
- Is Kelly here?
- No, Kelly's not here.

34:35.389 --> 34:39.018
No, I think she is.
I'd like to see my daughter, please.

34:39.728 --> 34:42.480
Yes, of course, Jackie. Please come in.

34:42.731 --> 34:45.065
- Go find Kelly, Brenda.
- Mom.

34:45.734 --> 34:47.235
Brenda, now.

34:57.329 --> 35:00.165
- You have a lovely home.
- Thank you.

35:01.833 --> 35:04.502
I can only imagine
what you must think of me.

35:04.961 --> 35:06.629
I don't even know you.

35:07.255 --> 35:09.549
I generally have
a wonderful sense of humor.

35:09.632 --> 35:12.302
But I guess it misfired this afternoon.

35:15.889 --> 35:18.224
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetheart.

35:19.100 --> 35:20.476
Excuse me.

35:24.939 --> 35:29.611
- I'm not coming home.
- Kelly, I am sorry.

35:29.944 --> 35:33.531
I don't care.
Sorry just is not enough anymore.

35:33.656 --> 35:35.366
What do you want me to do?
You want me to get down

35:35.450 --> 35:36.826
on my hands and knees
and beg your forgiveness?

35:36.909 --> 35:39.245
- I'll do anything it takes.
- No.

35:39.328 --> 35:40.538
Honey,

35:42.623 --> 35:47.044
- you know how much I love you.
- How is that possible, Mom?

35:47.712 --> 35:51.174
- You don't even love yourself.
- I know you're upset.

35:51.299 --> 35:53.301
You have a right to be.

35:54.010 --> 35:55.469
I slipped up.

35:55.553 --> 35:58.598
Is that what you call it
when you humiliate yourself

35:58.681 --> 36:01.392
- in front of the entire school?
- It's my humiliation.

36:01.475 --> 36:03.311
Why can't you let it be my problem?

36:03.394 --> 36:06.022
Because you don't have to go to school
with those people on Monday

36:06.105 --> 36:07.732
whispering behind my back.

36:07.815 --> 36:09.900
I think you're exaggerating the situation.

36:09.984 --> 36:13.320
- Things finished quite smoothly.
- Yeah, right. According to you.

36:13.404 --> 36:15.990
But I don't care,
because you broke a promise to me

36:16.073 --> 36:17.992
and you broke a promise to yourself.

36:18.075 --> 36:20.536
And I'm not going to live with a mother
who I can't trust anymore.

36:20.619 --> 36:21.954
What do you want from me?

36:22.037 --> 36:24.623
You want me to take a Breathalyzer test
when I come home at night?

36:24.707 --> 36:26.375
You want to test my urine for drugs?

36:26.459 --> 36:28.419
I want you to go back to Timber Hills.

36:28.502 --> 36:31.297
It's just like last time, you think
you can control it, but you can't.

36:31.380 --> 36:33.924
Kelly, this is not like last time.

36:34.216 --> 36:37.970
No, last time I found you lying
in a pile of blood and broken glass

36:38.053 --> 36:40.514
after you put your fist
through the dining room table.

36:40.598 --> 36:42.016
I'm sorry.

36:42.099 --> 36:44.268
Honey, you're just going to have to
trust me on this one.

36:44.351 --> 36:48.147
- I think things are going to be okay.
- Mom, you need help.

36:48.731 --> 36:51.191
You don't even know
what okay is anymore.

36:51.275 --> 36:54.528
Don't you realize what your drinking
and cocaine does to me?

36:54.611 --> 36:57.823
I am in high school, Mom.
I need somebody to take care of me,

36:57.906 --> 37:01.326
- to listen to my problems.
- I'm there for you, Kel.

37:01.493 --> 37:03.787
I'm your best friend in the whole world.

37:03.871 --> 37:06.874
I don't need a best friend.
I need a mother.

37:07.749 --> 37:11.503
And I don't care if you're fat,
I don't care if you're old,

37:11.587 --> 37:15.549
I don't care if you're beautiful.
I love you no matter what.

37:15.966 --> 37:18.385
So maybe you should just stop worrying
about what you look like

37:18.468 --> 37:22.556
- and start figuring out who you are.
- I can't be everything to everybody.

37:23.515 --> 37:24.725
You don't have to be.

37:24.808 --> 37:28.103
But when you're drinking, Mom,
you are nothing to nobody.

37:30.021 --> 37:31.982
You can stay here for dinner,

37:32.065 --> 37:33.942
but I want you home.

37:49.583 --> 37:52.502
Kelly, how did it go?

37:53.670 --> 37:55.171
Not so well.

37:59.134 --> 38:00.552
It's okay.

38:01.219 --> 38:02.595
It's okay.

38:05.640 --> 38:07.016
It's okay.

38:27.745 --> 38:30.123
Mom! I'm home.

38:34.836 --> 38:35.962
Mom?

38:37.964 --> 38:39.090
Mom.

38:40.258 --> 38:41.384
Mom?

38:42.885 --> 38:44.220
Hi, baby.

38:44.554 --> 38:46.889
Mom, what are you doing?
Where are you going?

38:46.973 --> 38:49.934
Timber Hills. First thing in the morning.

38:53.020 --> 38:55.273
Thank you. Thank you.

38:56.315 --> 38:59.402
No, thank you.

39:01.988 --> 39:05.366
If you only knew how much I love you

39:07.410 --> 39:09.203
and how sorry I am.

39:10.997 --> 39:14.750
- I never meant to cause you any pain.
- I know.

39:17.795 --> 39:19.880
What you said to me, Kel,

39:21.507 --> 39:23.175
really hit home.

39:24.427 --> 39:27.096
You've never talked that way
to me before.

39:28.848 --> 39:31.142
It's only because I love you.

39:32.685 --> 39:34.228
I know you do.

39:37.022 --> 39:39.525
I'm not sure I deserve your love.

39:42.278 --> 39:44.697
Someday I hope

39:46.949 --> 39:49.868
you can be as proud to have me
as a mother

39:50.661 --> 39:53.205
as I am to have you as a daughter.

40:13.016 --> 40:14.309
Brandon.

40:18.188 --> 40:21.108
- Brandon, are you asleep?
- Yes.

40:23.735 --> 40:25.779
I feel like such a jerk.

40:28.365 --> 40:30.409
You had to wake me up
on Sunday morning

40:30.492 --> 40:32.369
to give me this news?

40:33.620 --> 40:37.082
It couldn't have waited until, say,
after breakfast?

40:39.251 --> 40:42.379
I can't believe
I was so blind to Kelly's mom.

40:42.587 --> 40:45.715
And to what Kelly
must have been going through.

40:46.007 --> 40:48.760
I always thought
she had the most perfect life.

40:49.344 --> 40:52.597
Hey, you always gotta be
a little suspicious of perfection.

40:52.681 --> 40:56.059
I'm supposed to be her best friend.
Why didn't she tell me?

40:56.560 --> 40:58.019
Maybe she tried.

40:58.603 --> 41:00.272
I think she did.

41:02.190 --> 41:05.360
I was just too shallow
to pick up on the clues.

41:05.819 --> 41:09.489
- Some friend I am.
- Hey, come on, give yourself a break.

41:10.657 --> 41:12.075
How were you supposed to know?

41:12.158 --> 41:15.078
It's a problem
you've never had to deal with before.

41:15.161 --> 41:16.454
I guess.

41:17.747 --> 41:20.875
But the way I treated Mom,
I feel like such a fool.

41:21.793 --> 41:25.797
You know, the amazing thing
about Mom is that she's always there

41:25.880 --> 41:27.882
to accept your apology.

41:28.550 --> 41:33.179
Kind of like the Rock of Ages,
just sitting, waiting patiently.

41:35.640 --> 41:39.269
Brandon, I'm sure she'd love
to hear herself described that way.

41:41.854 --> 41:43.481
Where're you going?

41:43.898 --> 41:46.317
I wouldn't wanna keep the rock waiting.

41:53.032 --> 41:56.285
I'm calling because
I just wanted to say thanks.

41:56.536 --> 41:58.204
I think everything's gonna be okay.

41:58.287 --> 42:00.206
Oh, Kelly, that's wonderful.

42:00.373 --> 42:03.042
And I think that Brenda's really lucky
to have a mom like you.

42:03.125 --> 42:04.460
<i>Well, thank you.</i>

42:04.544 --> 42:06.587
Although I'm afraid
she'll never realize it.

42:06.671 --> 42:10.132
It's a law of nature,
no girl can appreciate her own mother.

42:10.591 --> 42:13.135
<i>- Okay, bye-bye. And good luck, Kelly.
- Bye.</i>

42:16.389 --> 42:17.765
What did Kelly want?

42:17.848 --> 42:20.226
She just wanted me to know
how lucky I was

42:20.309 --> 42:22.645
to have such a great daughter.

42:23.646 --> 42:26.899
- I'm really sorry, Mom.
- Brenda, it's all right.

42:26.982 --> 42:28.317
No, it's not.

42:28.401 --> 42:31.821
Not after I kept on making you feel
like Jackie was so hip and beautiful

42:31.904 --> 42:33.197
and fun.

42:33.489 --> 42:35.658
Well, I'm sure she is all those things.

42:35.741 --> 42:36.951
Maybe.

42:37.326 --> 42:40.120
You know what, you're a whole lot more.

42:41.539 --> 42:44.708
I try my best, Brenda.
Just like my mother did.

42:44.833 --> 42:47.836
But you know what,
she's not perfect either.

42:48.170 --> 42:51.298
Although she'd probably
have you believe that she is.

42:53.717 --> 42:56.136
- What's this?
- I love you.

42:56.303 --> 42:58.972
I guess I never really tell you that, do I?

42:59.223 --> 43:01.767
Well, it's always nice to hear.

43:05.938 --> 43:07.272
What's this?

43:08.357 --> 43:11.151
A little something from all of us, Dad.

43:27.876 --> 43:29.211
- Hi.
- Hi.

43:30.420 --> 43:32.798
- Taking a trip?
- Sort of.

43:33.423 --> 43:35.550
- Listen, is Kelly home?
- Go right in.

43:35.634 --> 43:38.136
- She should be down in a second.
- Thanks.

43:45.769 --> 43:47.813
What are you doing here?

43:48.688 --> 43:51.316
I thought you might wanna have this.

43:51.900 --> 43:53.485
It's the tape of the fashion show.

43:53.568 --> 43:56.112
You know,
with your mom and everything.

43:56.279 --> 43:57.531
Thanks.

43:58.114 --> 44:01.868
I didn't think you'd want it going
in the video yearbook.

44:04.037 --> 44:05.747
You're a pretty nice guy.

44:06.623 --> 44:07.749
Wow.

44:13.296 --> 44:14.798
Come on, Kel.

44:17.133 --> 44:19.928
- So where're you guys going?
- Road trip.

44:23.264 --> 44:26.935
- It's a nice day for a drive.
- Yeah, it is, isn't it?
