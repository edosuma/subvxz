03:18.830 --> 03:19.854
( Nate )
HEY.

03:19.860 --> 03:21.999
HI, I NEED
TO SIT DOWN.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.729
OH, GOD,
I'M SO FAT.

03:26.030 --> 03:28.521
SO, WHAT PAPERS
DO YOU NEED ME TO SIGN ?

03:28.530 --> 03:31.226
NOW DON'T TELL ME
I FORGOT THEM.

03:31.230 --> 03:33.528
I'M FORGE'ITING
EVERYTHING.

03:33.530 --> 03:35.953
IT'S BECAUSE
OF THE HORMONES.

03:36.830 --> 03:38.525
WHICH,
BY THE WAY,

03:38.530 --> 03:41.249
MADE ME A COMPLETE FREAK
THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU.

03:41.260 --> 03:44.093
I'M SORRY AGAIN
FOR BEING SO HOSTILE.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.851
CLAIRE !

03:49.860 --> 03:51.555
HOW ARE YOU DOING ?

03:51.560 --> 03:53.790
IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.620
HEY, LISA, I DIDN'T
KNOW YOU WERE IN TOWN.

03:55.630 --> 03:56.892
WHAT'S NEW ?

03:56.900 --> 03:59.095
DOING THE WHOLE
SINGLE MOM ROUTINE.

03:59.100 --> 04:01.591
RIGHT, I CAN SEE THAT,
GOOD FOR YOU.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.898
ARE YOU TAKING PICTURES
THESE DAYS ?

04:03.900 --> 04:06.619
NO, I TOOK SOME PHOTOS
WITH A FRIEND'S CAMERA AND...

04:06.630 --> 04:09.190
I WANTED TO KEEP DOING IT,
SO I WENT ON E-BAY

04:09.200 --> 04:10.553
AND I GOT MY OWN.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.721
IT WAS REALLY JUST
BECAUSE I WAS BORED AND...

04:12.730 --> 04:14.027
IT'S KIND
OF STUPID.

04:14.030 --> 04:15.850
BUT, UM, I HAVE
TO GO TO SCHOOL.

04:15.860 --> 04:18.055
SO, I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.693
( door closing )

04:23.760 --> 04:26.024
( Keith )
I'LL BE OUT
IN A SECOND.

04:26.030 --> 04:27.725
SHIT.

04:35.430 --> 04:37.523
OKAY, LET'S GO.

04:37.530 --> 04:41.455
HEY, DO YOU THINK YOUR CHAIR
SEEMS RIGHT FOR THAT SPACE ?

04:43.130 --> 04:44.529
YOU SAID
YOU WERE KIDDING

04:44.530 --> 04:47.249
ABOUT ME NOT BRINGING ANY
OF MY UGLY-ASS FURNITURE.

04:47.260 --> 04:48.818
IT'S SO BIG.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.491
IT'S A REALLY GOOD CHAIR
FOR WATCHING TELEVISION.

04:50.500 --> 04:51.956
I GUESS.

04:53.730 --> 04:55.652
MAYBE IT IS
TOO BIG.

04:55.660 --> 04:57.890
I THINK IT IS,
IT'S TOO BIG.

04:57.900 --> 05:01.950
YOU KNOW, I'LL PUT IT IN STORAGE
WITH THE REST OF MY STUFF.

05:01.960 --> 05:04.895
OH, SHIT, I GO'I'I'A RETURN
"A GREAT ESCAPE" TODAY.

05:04.900 --> 05:06.788
I'M GONNA
BE FUCKING LATE.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.495
I'LL RETURN IT,
IT'S ON MY WAY.

05:08.500 --> 05:11.151
I NEVER GET TIRED
OF WATCHING STEVE MCQUEEN.

05:11.160 --> 05:14.618
I THINK I'VE SEEN EVERY ONE OF
HIS MOVIES AT LEAST THREE TIMES.

05:14.630 --> 05:16.552
YEAH, SOME OF THEM
FOUR TIMES.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.119
WOW,
THIS IS--

05:25.130 --> 05:27.098
SINCE I WANT TO PUT YOUR NAME
ON THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE,

05:27.100 --> 05:29.751
MY LAWYER SAYS YOU NEED TO
SIGN AWAY ALL CUSTODIAL RIGHTS.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.796
OH, I THOUGHT...

05:31.800 --> 05:33.552
WHAT ?

05:34.730 --> 05:37.790
I THOUGHT WE WERE
JUST GONNA BE A LITTLE MORE
CASUAL ABOUT THIS.

05:37.800 --> 05:39.256
IT'S A BABY.

05:39.260 --> 05:41.296
IT'S HARD TO BE
THAT CASUAL ABOUT IT.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.494
RIGHT.

05:42.500 --> 05:46.652
UM, MAYBE I SHOULD
HAVE MY LAWYER LOOK AT THIS.

05:46.660 --> 05:48.651
NATE, IT'S JUST
A FORMALITY.

05:48.660 --> 05:50.457
CUT THE BULLSHIT
AND JUST SIGN IT.

05:50.460 --> 05:51.427
OKAY.

05:55.860 --> 05:58.021
YOU KNOW WHAT'S WEIRD
ABOUT DEAD PEOPLE ?

05:58.030 --> 05:59.497
UM, EVERYTHING ?

05:59.500 --> 06:01.388
HOW THEY
LOOK SO PERFECT.

06:01.400 --> 06:04.392
I JUST WANT TO
MESS THIS WOMAN'S HAIR UP
A LITTLE BIT.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.254
PLEASE, DON'T.

06:12.060 --> 06:14.392
WHEN I DIE,
I WANT TO BE ONE BIG MESS.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.618
THAT'S WHAT
LIFE IS, MESSY.

06:16.630 --> 06:19.497
NATE, I'M NOT
ACCUSING YOU.

06:19.500 --> 06:22.321
IT'S BE'I'I'ER THIS WAY,
WE BOTH KNOW THAT.

06:22.330 --> 06:24.696
I MEAN,
I CAN'T LIE.

06:24.700 --> 06:27.021
OF COURSE I WOULD'VE LOVED
TO DO THIS WITH SOMEONE

06:27.030 --> 06:29.055
WHO WANTED
TO BE A FATHER.

06:29.060 --> 06:30.721
I'M SORRY.

06:31.960 --> 06:34.019
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO--

06:34.030 --> 06:36.555
BUT THEN I THINK
HOW PERFECT THIS BABY IS.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.790
AND EVERYTHING
SOMEHOW SEEMS RIGHT.

06:42.030 --> 06:44.294
SOMEHOW
IT'S JUST SO FUNNY.

06:44.300 --> 06:47.394
AND YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
I'M PROUD IN A WEIRD WAY.

06:47.400 --> 06:49.220
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

06:49.230 --> 06:52.119
I MEAN, I'M HAVING A CHILD WITH
THE LAST PERSON IN THE WORLD

06:52.130 --> 06:53.791
WHO WOULD EVER
WANT A CHILD.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.697
( door opening
and closing )

07:06.100 --> 07:07.658
( knocking )

07:07.660 --> 07:11.118
WHY AREN'T YOU
WEARING YOUR CASTS ?

07:12.160 --> 07:14.151
I TAKE THEM OFF.

07:14.160 --> 07:16.151
IS TIME
FOR ME TO GO.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.549
BUT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
KEEP THEM ON UNTIL NEXT WEEK.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.050
I'M CALLING
THE DOCTOR.

07:20.060 --> 07:21.618
HE SAY IT'S OKAY,
LOOK...

07:21.630 --> 07:23.359
SEE ?

07:24.360 --> 07:26.396
YOUR LEFT FOOT
LOOKS PURPLE.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.220
IS ALWAYS LIKE THAT.

07:28.230 --> 07:30.289
IS FROM BAD CIRCULATION,
YOU KNOW THAT.

07:30.300 --> 07:31.949
I GUESS I FORGOT.

07:33.030 --> 07:37.057
OKAY, IT'S TIME TO GET
THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD, YEAH ?

07:40.430 --> 07:41.727
UH...

07:41.730 --> 07:44.153
I GUESS
I COULD CALL A TAXI,

07:44.160 --> 07:46.355
EVEN THOUGH
IT'S A TOTAL RIP-OFF.

07:46.360 --> 07:47.918
I CAN DRIVE YOU !

07:50.160 --> 07:52.492
IT WAS
A HEART ATTACK.

07:52.500 --> 07:55.298
HE DIED
JUST LIKE THAT.

07:58.330 --> 08:01.254
SO, YOU WANT A TRADITIONAL
THAI BUDDHIST SERVICE ?

08:01.260 --> 08:03.728
IF THAT'S A PROBLEM
WE CAN GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

08:03.730 --> 08:06.153
THERE ARE VERY SPECIFIC ELEMENTS
AND IF YOU CAN'T DO IT--

08:06.160 --> 08:09.550
PHIL, PLEASE
DO NOT BEHAVE THIS WAY.

08:10.730 --> 08:12.823
YOU'LL HAVE TO
EXCUSE MY SON.

08:12.830 --> 08:17.426
HE AND MY HUSBAND HADN'T
SPOKEN IN MONTHS AND--

08:17.430 --> 08:18.749
MOM, PLEASE.

08:18.760 --> 08:21.024
NOT IN FRONT
OF THIS PERSON.

08:22.660 --> 08:24.821
OKAY, MR. FISHER,

08:24.830 --> 08:27.651
IF YOU KNOW THE PROCEDURE,
LET'S HEAR IT.

08:29.900 --> 08:32.926
UM, ACTUALLY I'VE ONLY BEEN
HERE FOR A YEAR OR SO, AND...

08:32.930 --> 08:34.750
ALTHOUGH I DID READ

08:34.760 --> 08:37.194
"ZEN AND THE ART
OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE"
IN HIGH SCHOOL

08:37.200 --> 08:39.919
( door opening )
AND UH, THAT'S PROBABLY
MY BROTHER.

08:39.930 --> 08:41.420
HEY, DAVID ?!

08:41.430 --> 08:43.091
SORRY I'M LATE,
I HAD TO STOP AT "VIDEO WEST"

08:43.100 --> 08:45.295
AND SOME FUCKING IDIOT IN
FRONT OF ME WAS WRITING A CHECK.

08:45.300 --> 08:47.552
I DIDN'T EVEN WANT
TO WATCH A MOVIE LAST NIGHT,

08:47.560 --> 08:49.528
BUT KEITH GOT HIS WAY,
AS USUAL.

08:49.530 --> 08:50.849
DAVID,

08:50.860 --> 08:52.350
THIS IS--

08:52.360 --> 08:53.998
BETTE AND PHIL SRISAI.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.319
I'M DAVID FISHER.

08:55.330 --> 08:57.423
I SPOKE TO YOU
ON THE PHONE YESTERDAY.

08:57.430 --> 08:59.694
I'M SO SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

08:59.700 --> 09:01.588
THANK YOU.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.398
WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING
MY FATHER'S SERVICE.

09:04.400 --> 09:06.595
I ASSUME THE DECEASED
WILL REMAIN AT THE TEMPLE

09:06.600 --> 09:08.989
FOR THREE DAYS BEFORE
WE HAVE THE SERVICE HERE ?

09:09.000 --> 09:10.524
AND OF COURSE
FISHER AND SONS

09:10.530 --> 09:12.623
WILL PROVIDE
ALL THE REQUISITE SUPPLIES.

09:12.630 --> 09:14.427
THE BUDDHA, THE ALTAR,
THE CARPET KNEELERS...

09:14.430 --> 09:17.422
AND YOU'LL WANT
SOME MONKS FOR CHANTING.

09:17.430 --> 09:20.194
WE PREFER TO USE
THE ONES FROM RIVERSIDE,

09:20.200 --> 09:22.395
BUT IF THOSE AREN'T
TO YOUR LIKING,

09:22.400 --> 09:24.789
WE HAVE SOME GOOD ONES
OVER IN EAGLE ROCK.

09:29.560 --> 09:32.324
NIKOLAI,
YOUR APARTMENT IS SO...

09:33.560 --> 09:35.221
IT'S VERY...

09:36.430 --> 09:38.295
IT HAS A LOT OF CHARM.

09:38.300 --> 09:40.393
THANK YOU.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.595
I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOUR BIG RUSH WAS.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.693
YOU COULD'VE
STAYED WITH ME UNTIL--

09:44.700 --> 09:45.997
IT WAS TIME.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.752
BUT HOW DO WE KNOW
YOU'RE SAFE HERE ?

09:47.760 --> 09:49.455
YOU COULD BE HURT
BY THESE RUFFIANS.

09:49.460 --> 09:50.825
I SPOKE TO YURI.

09:50.830 --> 09:53.025
I TELL HIM THAT FEBRUARY IS
THE BIGGEST MONTH FOR FLOWERS.

09:53.030 --> 09:55.419
HE SAYS HE GIVE ME 30 DAYS
TO COME UP WITH THE MONEY.

09:55.430 --> 09:57.398
ARE YOU GONNA
BE ABLE TO DO IT ?

09:57.400 --> 09:58.890
SURE, OF COURSE.

09:58.900 --> 10:00.549
OH, WELL,
THAT'S NICE.

10:00.560 --> 10:03.051
THANK YOU FOR ALL
THE TAKING CARE OF ME.

10:03.060 --> 10:04.459
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT NOW.

10:04.460 --> 10:05.597
YOU ARE DONE.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.057
WHAT ABOUT DINNER ?

10:08.060 --> 10:10.096
YOU PROBABLY
DON'T HAVE ANY FOOD

10:10.100 --> 10:12.227
AND I WAS GOING TO PACK
YOU LAMB, BUTI FORGOT.

10:12.230 --> 10:13.822
I'LL GO HOME
AND BRING BACK THE LAMB.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.127
NO, I'LL BE FINE.

10:15.130 --> 10:17.394
I GET TAKE-OUT
FROM EAT-A-PITA.

10:17.400 --> 10:18.799
OKAY.

10:20.060 --> 10:21.925
GOODBYE,
NIKOLAI.

10:23.860 --> 10:26.158
GOODBYE, RUTHIE.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.125
(flatulating )

10:42.460 --> 10:45.759
I BET YOU MR. VAN KIRK
HAS SEX WITH STUDENTS
IN HERE AFTER HOURS.

10:45.760 --> 10:49.093
WE SHOULD STAKE THIS PLACE
OUT LATER, OKAY ?

10:50.030 --> 10:50.928
CLAIRE ?

10:50.930 --> 10:52.659
OH, FUCK.

10:52.660 --> 10:55.128
I THINK THERE WAS DUST
ON THE NEGATIVE.

10:55.130 --> 10:56.620
NO ONE'S GONNA NOTICE.

10:56.630 --> 10:58.723
NO, I WANT IT
TO BE PERFECT.

10:58.730 --> 11:00.994
CLAIRE,
THESE ARE SO SICK.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.752
THAN KS.

11:02.760 --> 11:05.399
I'VE TAKEN SHOTS OF ALMOST
EVERY SINGLE PERSON

11:05.400 --> 11:07.550
THAT'S COME THROUGH THE HOUSE
IN THE PAST THREE WEEKS.

11:07.560 --> 11:09.448
THEY'RE AMAZING.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.394
IT'S LIKE EACH ONE
IS SOMEONE WHO'S...

11:11.400 --> 11:13.493
LYING IN BED WITH YOU,

11:13.500 --> 11:17.357
TELLING YOU A LITTLE STORY
BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP.

11:18.660 --> 11:22.050
I'M PUTTING THEM TOGETHER FOR
THAT THING FOR FOSTER'S CLASS.

11:22.060 --> 11:24.654
FUCKING SPOON RIVER
ANTHOLOGY PAPER ?

11:24.660 --> 11:25.922
YEAH.

11:25.930 --> 11:28.091
I JUST THOUGHT
THAT SINCE EACH POEM

11:28.100 --> 11:30.193
IS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE
OF A DEAD PERSON,

11:30.200 --> 11:32.521
THIS WOULD
BE AN INTERESTING WAY
TO LIKE...

11:32.530 --> 11:34.225
I DON'T KNOW,

11:34.230 --> 11:37.290
SHOW WHAT THE POEMS
BROUGHT OUT IN ME.

11:40.060 --> 11:41.948
OKAY, THAT SOUNDED
REALLY GEEKY.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.450
NO, THAT'S GENIUS.

11:43.460 --> 11:46.054
YOU COULD REALLY
DO SOMETHING WITH THIS.

11:46.060 --> 11:47.459
YEAH, RIGHT.

11:50.630 --> 11:53.121
CLAIRE, I HAVE
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

11:53.130 --> 11:55.018
I GOT INTO YALE.

11:55.030 --> 11:56.497
I HEARD YESTERDAY.

11:56.500 --> 12:00.152
YOU DON'T FEEL JEALOUS
OR HATE ME, RIGHT ?

12:01.460 --> 12:02.825
NO.

12:02.830 --> 12:05.754
YOU WORKED REALLY HARD FOR IT,
CONGRATULATIONS.

12:05.760 --> 12:08.399
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T
PLAY THE GAME THE WAY I DID,

12:08.400 --> 12:10.925
BUT I'M SURE
YOU'LL GET INTO UCLA,

12:10.930 --> 12:12.921
WHICH IS A REALLY
GOOD SCHOOL TOO.

12:12.930 --> 12:15.558
ACTUALLY, NO,
I DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT.

12:15.560 --> 12:19.394
BUT THEY SENT ME A LIST OF
COMMUNITY COLLEGES I COULD GO TO

12:19.400 --> 12:23.325
AND SAID
TO TRY AGAIN NEXT YEAR.

12:24.530 --> 12:27.090
SO, I'M LOOKING
AT EAST VALLEY.

12:27.100 --> 12:28.419
OH.

12:28.430 --> 12:30.352
HEY, I'M GONNA
BE A FAMOUS PHOTOGRAPHER,

12:30.360 --> 12:32.328
AND MAKE A GAZILLION DOLLARS
TAKING PICTURES OF

12:32.330 --> 12:34.798
ANOREXIC MODELS
AND FUCKED UP ACTORS.

12:34.800 --> 12:37.291
SO, MAYBE I DON'T EVEN NEED
TO GO TO COLLEGE, RIGHT ?

12:38.860 --> 12:40.498
IT'S A JOKE,
I'M JOKING.

12:40.500 --> 12:41.956
BUT YOU COULD.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.520
YOU SHOULD JUST
BECOME A PHOTOGRAPHER.

12:47.430 --> 12:50.752
BECAUSE TRUTH FULLY, EAST VALLEY
IS KIND OF A SHITTY SCHOOL.

13:00.130 --> 13:03.349
SO, THERE WAS THAT ONE
A MONTH AGO IN THE BOOKSTORE.

13:03.360 --> 13:06.397
THEN I MET THIS OTHER GUY
AT THE FARMER'S MARKET.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.459
THAT PLACE HAS
GOTTEN SO TOURISTY.

13:08.460 --> 13:11.293
AND THEN THERE WAS
THIS GUY LAST WEEK

13:11.300 --> 13:13.393
AT THE ROSE CAFE
WHO, UH...

13:14.930 --> 13:18.093
NO, THAT DOESN'T COUNT,
THAT WAS AN ALMOST ONE.

13:18.100 --> 13:20.796
WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU HOPE
TO GET OUT OF THERAPY ?

13:20.800 --> 13:25.749
UH... MELISSA GAVE ME
YOUR NUMBER BECAUSE

13:25.760 --> 13:28.024
I GUESS I'M--

13:28.030 --> 13:30.055
I DON'T KNOW...

13:32.430 --> 13:35.319
IT'S NOT THAT I'M UNHAPPY,
I'M NOT UNHAPPY.

13:35.330 --> 13:37.423
I'M REALLY NOT.

13:37.430 --> 13:40.593
BUT I KNOW THAT WHAT I'M DOING
IS A LITTLE STRANGE.

13:42.660 --> 13:45.629
I MEAN, UH,
MOST PEOPLE WHO...

13:45.630 --> 13:48.758
ARE ENGAGED TO SOMEONE
THEY REALLY LOVE

13:48.760 --> 13:50.648
DON'T HAVE SEX
WITH STRANGERS.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.525
OR MAYBE THEY DO.

13:53.530 --> 13:55.191
DOES THAT MATTER ?

13:59.200 --> 14:01.350
I THINK I LIKE
THE EUPHORIA

14:01.360 --> 14:03.726
I GET FROM
THESE ENCOUNTERS.

14:09.060 --> 14:10.596
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

14:10.600 --> 14:12.124
I DON'T KNOW,

14:12.130 --> 14:14.598
IT'S LIKE
I'M COEXISTING

14:14.600 --> 14:17.592
IN THESE
TWO SEPARATE REALITIES.

14:17.600 --> 14:19.454
THERE'S MY NATE REALITY

14:19.460 --> 14:21.951
AND THEN THERE'S
THIS OTHER REALITY.

14:21.960 --> 14:25.794
AND I WOULD LIKE
TO NOT FEEL

14:25.800 --> 14:27.495
SO ANXIOUS
ABOUT IT.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.722
IT'S NOT GUILT.

14:30.730 --> 14:33.198
IT'S JUST EDGINESS.

14:34.930 --> 14:37.797
SO, THAT'S IT.

14:37.800 --> 14:40.621
I'D LIKE TO
NOT FEEL EDGY,

14:40.630 --> 14:42.393
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

14:42.400 --> 14:45.028
OKAY, SO, YOU WOULD
LIKE TO CONTINUE

14:45.030 --> 14:48.158
TO HAVE THESE ENCOUNTERS,
AS YOU CALL THEM,

14:48.160 --> 14:51.618
BUT YOU WOULD
LIKE NOT TO FEEL EDGY.

14:51.630 --> 14:53.120
IDEALLY.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.698
I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

14:58.700 --> 15:01.351
YOU THINK THAT
I'M AFRAID OF INTIMACY

15:01.360 --> 15:04.523
SO I'M TRYING TO SABOTAGE
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY FIANC.

15:04.530 --> 15:07.852
IS THAT WHAT I'M THINKING OR
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ?

15:07.860 --> 15:09.088
NO.

15:09.100 --> 15:12.194
I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY
THAT I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK

15:12.200 --> 15:14.327
THAT WHAT I'M DOING
IS DESTRUCT IVE.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.890
IT MIGHT
EVEN BE HEALTHY.

15:17.900 --> 15:19.458
HOW SO ?

15:19.460 --> 15:23.590
MAYBE IT'S NOT GOOD FOR ME
TO TOTALLY LOSE MYSELF

15:23.600 --> 15:24.953
IN ONE PERSON

15:24.960 --> 15:28.623
AND THIS IS A WAY FOR ME
TO HAVE A...

15:28.630 --> 15:32.589
COMPLETELY SEPARATE
PRIVATE AREA THAT'S...

15:32.600 --> 15:34.454
MY OWN.

15:34.460 --> 15:38.055
NOT HIS,
NOT OURS.

15:38.060 --> 15:41.120
MAYBE THAT'S
HEALTHY FOR ME.

15:41.130 --> 15:42.324
LISTEN,

15:42.330 --> 15:44.457
I ASSUME THAT
MELISSA TOLD YOU

15:44.460 --> 15:47.327
ONE OF MY SPECIALTIES
IS SEXUAL ADDICTION.

15:47.330 --> 15:48.558
NO.

15:48.560 --> 15:51.028
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU KNOW OF THIS ISSUE,

15:51.030 --> 15:54.454
BUT OBVIOUSLY IT INVOLVES
THE SUBLIMATION OF EMOTIONS

15:54.460 --> 15:56.599
THAT ARE TOO PAINFUL
TO ADDRESS.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.921
IT'S THE ROOT OF
ALL ADDICTION REALLY...

15:58.930 --> 16:00.921
( Brenda imagining )
I'M SORRY, BUTI DON'T
THINK I CAN HELP YOU

16:00.930 --> 16:02.727
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
NEED ANY HELP.

16:02.730 --> 16:04.925
YOU'VE CLEARLY EVOLVED
BEYOND THE NEED FOR THERAPY.

16:04.930 --> 16:06.454
I'M ACTUALLY
IN AWE OF YOU

16:06.460 --> 16:09.054
BECAUSE I'D BE FUCKING STRANGERS
LIKE A TRUCK STOP WHORE ON CRACK

16:09.060 --> 16:11.028
IF I WASN'T SO INHIBITED
BY MY PATHETIC

16:11.030 --> 16:12.725
JUDEO-CHRISTIAN
UPBRINGING.

16:12.730 --> 16:14.322
IT'S NOT DOWN HERE.

16:14.330 --> 16:16.924
WE USED TO HAVE
A FEW BUDDHAS IN HERE.

16:16.930 --> 16:18.818
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I CAN'T FIND ONE.

16:18.830 --> 16:20.718
YOU KNOW, I'VE READ A LOT
OF STUFF ABOUT BUDDHISM,

16:20.730 --> 16:22.197
BUT IT NEVER
STAYS WITH ME.

16:22.200 --> 16:24.293
I JUST KNOW THAT
EVERYTHING IS NOTHING.

16:24.300 --> 16:26.757
IS THAT IT, I THOUGHT IT WAS
NOTHING IS EVERYTHING.

16:26.760 --> 16:28.489
THAT'S THE SAME THING,
ISN'T IT ?

16:28.500 --> 16:29.899
HEY, I FOUND ONE.

16:31.230 --> 16:33.448
HE LOOKS KIND OF GIRLY,
DOESN'T HE ?

16:33.460 --> 16:35.690
SORT OF.

16:35.700 --> 16:37.019
HE HAS WATER DAMAGE.

16:37.030 --> 16:39.191
I'LL GET YOU SOME STUFF
TO CLEAN HIM OFF, OKAY ?

16:39.200 --> 16:42.499
HIS LITTLE HAT IS CUTE,
IT'S SO POINTY.

16:42.500 --> 16:45.424
I WONDER IF ANYONE
EVER POKED THEIR EYES OUT
ON ONE BY ACCIDENT.

16:45.430 --> 16:47.751
LOOK AT ALL TH ESE
UNCLAIMED CREMAINS.

16:47.760 --> 16:50.251
CAN YOU IMAGINE HAVING A MEMBER
OF YOUR FAMILY CREMATED

16:50.260 --> 16:52.649
AND THEN NOT CARING ENOUGH
TO PICK UP THEIR ASHES ?

16:52.660 --> 16:55.026
I THINK SOMETIMES...

16:55.030 --> 16:57.498
IT'S TOO HARD FOR PEOPLE
TO ACKNOWLEDGE

16:57.500 --> 17:00.355
THAT SOMEONE THEY LOVED
IS NOW JUST CHUNKS OF SOOT.

17:00.360 --> 17:01.622
( phone )

17:03.000 --> 17:04.649
DAVID FISHER.

17:04.660 --> 17:06.389
HEY.

17:07.400 --> 17:10.528
YES, I RETURNED THE VIDEOS,
DIDN'T I SAY I WOULD ?

17:10.530 --> 17:14.455
UM, SURE, SWORDFISH
IS FINE, WHATEVER.

17:14.460 --> 17:15.654
BYE.

17:15.660 --> 17:18.094
YOU HATE SWORDFISH.

17:19.760 --> 17:21.421
I KNOW.

17:21.430 --> 17:24.297
IT'S FUNNY, NOW THAT KEITH
AND I ARE LIVING TOGETHER,

17:24.300 --> 17:27.189
I FIND MYSELF TRYING TO BE SO
FUCKING AGREEABLE ALL THE TIME.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.599
WHY ?

17:28.600 --> 17:30.625
BECAUSE IF YOU AREN'T,
THINGS COME UP.

17:30.630 --> 17:32.791
AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW BIG
THE THING'S GOING TO BE.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.427
IT'S LIKE THIS
CONSTANT NEGOTIATION,

17:34.430 --> 17:36.694
YOU CAN NEVER
JUST RELAX.

17:36.700 --> 17:40.192
IS THAT JUST A PHASE OR IS IT
ALWAYS GOING TO BE LIKE THAT ?

17:40.200 --> 17:41.656
DON'T ASK ME.

17:41.660 --> 17:43.525
LOOK, I HAVE
NO FUCKING IDEA.

17:44.500 --> 17:47.253
MAYBE THAT'S JUST
WHAT A RELATIONSHIP IS.

17:47.260 --> 17:50.593
CONSTANTLY DOING THINGS YOU HAVE
ABSOLUTELY NO DESIRE TO DO.

17:51.900 --> 17:54.619
NATE, BRENDA,
COME ON IN !

17:56.730 --> 17:59.290
WE HAVE SO MANY DETAILS
TO GO OVER

17:59.300 --> 18:01.427
BEFORE THE BRIDAL SHOWER
ON SUNDAY.

18:01.430 --> 18:03.694
ISN'T IT EXCITING ?

18:03.700 --> 18:05.793
IT'S ALL
TOO MUCH FOR ME.

18:05.800 --> 18:07.620
OH, PLEASE,
IT'S ALL FOR YOU.

18:07.630 --> 18:09.222
I'D RATHER
JUST CANCEL IT.

18:09.230 --> 18:10.549
ARE YOU MAD ?

18:10.560 --> 18:13.324
LULU SMEIGEL CANCELLED
HER WEEKEND AT CANYON RANCH

18:13.330 --> 18:14.854
JUST TO BE HERE.

18:14.860 --> 18:17.693
NOW, YOU MUST
TRY ONE OF THESE.

18:17.700 --> 18:20.089
IT'S MADE FROM
THIS INCREDIBLE LIQUEUR

18:20.100 --> 18:23.024
THAT COMES FROM
THE MOST POVERTY-STRICKEN
VILLAGE IN BELIZE.

18:23.030 --> 18:24.691
IT'S DELICIOUS.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.122
OH, RIGHT,
YOUR TRIP.

18:26.130 --> 18:28.121
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU HAD A GOOD TIME.

18:28.130 --> 18:29.859
IT WAS FABULOUS.

18:29.860 --> 18:32.795
YOUR SKIN LOOKS GOOD,
DID YOU HAVE SOME WORK DONE ?

18:32.800 --> 18:35.451
NOT AT ALL,
IT'S JUST HAPPINESS.

18:35.460 --> 18:37.291
YOU SHOULD
TRY IT SOMETIME.

18:37.300 --> 18:39.154
( banging sounds )

18:39.160 --> 18:40.889
IS BILLY HERE ?

18:40.900 --> 18:43.289
NO, NO, WHEN I GOT BACK,
I FOUND A NOTE

18:43.300 --> 18:45.655
SAYING THAT HE WAS STAYING
WITH FRIENDS IN PORTLAND.

18:45.660 --> 18:47.150
BUT HE DIDN'T
LEAVE A NUMBER.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.923
BRENDA, DID HE
GIVE IT TO YOU ?

18:48.930 --> 18:50.249
NO, HE DIDN'T.

18:50.260 --> 18:51.454
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

18:51.460 --> 18:54.122
HE STILL HAS ALL THAT RAGING
RESENTMENT TOWARDS YOU.

18:54.130 --> 18:57.122
( banging )
OKAY MOM, WHO ARE YOU
HIDING IN THE BEDROOM ?

18:57.130 --> 18:58.552
OH, LET ME GUESS,

18:58.560 --> 19:00.448
ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR YOUNG,
SOUTH-AMERICAN GIGOLOS ?

19:00.460 --> 19:01.859
NOT AT ALL,
DARLING.

19:01.860 --> 19:04.294
HE'S AN AGING INTELLECTUAL
FROM THE BRONX.

19:05.360 --> 19:06.657
BRENDA.

19:06.660 --> 19:08.298
NATE.

19:08.300 --> 19:10.860
ISN'T THIS FABULOUS ?

19:10.860 --> 19:13.021
BERN AND I
ARE BACK

19:13.030 --> 19:14.850
AND BETTER THAN EVER.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.656
( laughing )

19:17.660 --> 19:20.299
SO, I REALIZED I'D
MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE,

19:20.300 --> 19:22.393
GOT ON THE NEXT PLANE
TO BELIZE

19:22.400 --> 19:24.391
AND BEGGED YOUR MOTHER
TO TAKE ME BACK.

19:24.400 --> 19:27.392
COME ON, BE HONEST, DEAR,
THE WHORE DUMPED YOU.

19:27.400 --> 19:31.052
BECAUSE I WAS SUBCONSCIOUSLY
PUSHING HER AWAY

19:31.060 --> 19:33.949
BECAUSE I REALLY
LOVE YOU.

19:35.160 --> 19:38.425
THE POINT IS,
THE SEX HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE.

19:38.430 --> 19:41.092
JUST LIKE
WHEN WE FIRST MET.

19:41.100 --> 19:43.193
I'LL NEVER FORGET
WHAT YOU WERE WEARING

19:43.200 --> 19:45.418
THE FIRST TIME YOU WALKED
INTO MY OFFICE.

19:45.430 --> 19:47.694
THE TIGHT GIVENCHY BLUE SKIRT
WITH THE SLIT

19:47.700 --> 19:50.521
THAT WENT RIGHT UP
TO MY WAZOO.

19:50.530 --> 19:53.829
I KNEW IMMEDIATELY I WAS GONNA
HAVE SOME WILDLY INAPPROPRIATE

19:53.830 --> 19:55.354
FEELINGS FOR YOU.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.827
AND BOY,
WAS I RIGHT.

19:56.830 --> 19:58.798
MOM WAS
ONE OF DAD'S PATIENTS.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.018
IT'S ACTUALLY
KIND OF DISGUSTING.

20:01.030 --> 20:04.158
I WAS NOT A PATIENT,
I WAS IN GRAD SCHOOL.

20:05.360 --> 20:06.952
I WAS AN INTERN.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.928
AND THE SECOND
I LAID DOWN,

20:08.930 --> 20:12.559
I KNEW I WAS NEVER GONNA
GET UP OFF THAT COUCH.

20:12.560 --> 20:14.721
WE TERMINATED THERAPY
AFTER A FEW MONTHS

20:14.730 --> 20:16.721
AND WAITED
THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF TIME

20:16.730 --> 20:19.790
BEFORE EMBARKING
ON A RELATIONSHIP.

20:19.800 --> 20:22.928
AT LEAST THAT'S
WHAT WE TELL EVERYONE.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.522
( loud laughing )

20:27.360 --> 20:30.022
I'LL GIVE YOU
A HAND WITH THAT.

20:38.630 --> 20:40.894
OKAY, WHAT ?

20:42.230 --> 20:44.994
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU JUST TOOK HIM BACK.

20:46.530 --> 20:49.988
ARE YOU THAT SCARED
OF BEING ALONE ?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.491
GOD, YOU'RE SO
FUCKING DEPRESSING.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.855
I LOVE YOUR FATHER.

20:54.860 --> 20:58.023
AND I'M VERY HAPPY
YOU NOTICED IT YOURSELF.

21:00.030 --> 21:02.828
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT'S
UPSETTING YOU SO MUCH,
THAT I'M SO HAPPY.

21:04.600 --> 21:08.297
I'M SORRY FOR WHATEVER
TENSIONS THIS ENGAGEMENT

21:08.300 --> 21:10.894
IS BRINGING UP
IN YOU AND NATE.

21:10.900 --> 21:13.095
BUT MY ADVICE TO YOU

21:13.100 --> 21:15.591
IS GET
YOUR SHIT TOGETHER

21:15.600 --> 21:17.818
AND DON'T BLOW IT
WITH THIS ONE.

21:17.830 --> 21:20.651
BECAUSE YOU
ARE A MAJOR HANDFUL.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.320
SORRY.

21:27.330 --> 21:29.855
I NOTICED A COFFEE STAIN
ON THE COUCH.

21:29.860 --> 21:31.896
I WAS TRYING
TO GET IT OUT.

21:33.400 --> 21:36.221
ARE YOU STILL MAD AT ME
ABOUT THE SWORDFISH ?

21:36.230 --> 21:39.154
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME YOU
DIDN'T LIKE IT THIS AFTERNOON,

21:39.160 --> 21:41.025
INSTEAD OF WAITING
UNTIL I SLAVED OVER IT.

21:41.030 --> 21:42.998
YOU'RE RIGHT,
I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.820
SO, WHY DIDN'T YOU ?

21:46.500 --> 21:48.559
BECAUSE YOU SCARE ME.

21:48.560 --> 21:50.892
SHUT THE FUCK UP.

21:50.900 --> 21:53.118
YOU WANT EVERYTHING
TO BE PERFECT.

21:53.130 --> 21:55.121
ALL THE TIME.

21:55.130 --> 21:56.654
WHEN IT'S NOT,
YOU GET UPSET.

21:56.660 --> 21:59.959
I DIDN'T GET
ANY SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

21:59.960 --> 22:02.099
I'M TOO TIRED
FOR THIS CONVERSATION.

22:15.030 --> 22:17.726
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE
IF I DON'T DO OR SAY

22:17.730 --> 22:19.197
EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT,

22:19.200 --> 22:21.623
YOU MIGHT DECIDE YOU DON'T
WANT TO BE WITH ME.

22:21.630 --> 22:24.394
THAT'S JUST STUPID.

22:26.060 --> 22:27.891
THAN KS.

22:37.960 --> 22:40.929
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE WERE
TOGETHER THE FIRST TIME,

22:40.930 --> 22:44.058
IT SEEMED LIKE ALL OUR PROBLEMS
STEMMED FROM MY NOT COMING OUT.

22:44.060 --> 22:45.357
THEY DID.

22:47.500 --> 22:51.391
NO, I THINK IT WAS
JUST EASIER FOR YOU
TO MAKE US BELIEVE THAT.

22:53.860 --> 22:56.556
IF EVERYTHING COULD BE BLAMED
ON MY NOT COMING OUT,

22:56.560 --> 22:58.892
THEN NOTHING EVER
HAD TO BE YOUR FAULT.

23:20.960 --> 23:23.349
(child laughing )

23:34.600 --> 23:36.795
WHAT'S UNDER THAT ARM
RIGHT HERE ?

23:36.800 --> 23:38.654
HEY, NATE.

23:38.660 --> 23:40.127
HEY.

23:40.130 --> 23:41.757
SAY HELLO TO NATE.

23:41.760 --> 23:43.091
HELLO.

23:44.130 --> 23:45.597
( laughing )

23:49.860 --> 23:51.327
ALRIGHT.

23:51.330 --> 23:53.321
LET'S GO.

23:56.130 --> 23:57.757
LOOK, VAN ESSA'S SISTER,

23:57.760 --> 23:59.318
SHE'S GOT
THIS PUBLICIST

23:59.330 --> 24:01.525
AND THE FIRST THING
SHE DOES IS GET HER INVITED

24:01.530 --> 24:03.555
TO SOME DUMB SPA THING
IN LONG BEACH.

24:03.560 --> 24:04.891
SO?

24:04.900 --> 24:06.356
SO, SHE TOOK VANESSA
AND THE BABY

24:06.360 --> 24:08.351
NOW MY SITTER'S SICK,
SO HERE WE ARE.

24:08.360 --> 24:11.625
MRS. HIRSCH NEEDS
TO BE FINISHED BY ONE.

24:11.630 --> 24:13.825
NATE, I HAVE A KID.

24:13.830 --> 24:15.957
OKAY, THESE TYPE
OF THINGS HAPPEN.

24:15.960 --> 24:17.996
ANYHOW, I GAVE MRS. HIRSCH
THE ONCE OVER.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.059
SHE'S A YOUNG BREAST CANCER,
PIECE OF CAKE.

24:20.060 --> 24:22.449
HOPEFULLY, I'LL GET A SITTER
IN TIME TO DO HER.

24:22.460 --> 24:24.189
THAT'S NOT
GOOD ENOUGH.

24:25.500 --> 24:28.389
MY HANDS ARE
TIED HERE, OKAY ?

24:29.530 --> 24:32.920
UNLESS YOU WANT TO
TAKE CARE OF JULIO
WHILE I DO MRS. HIRSCH ?

24:32.930 --> 24:34.056
NO--

24:34.060 --> 24:35.994
OH, C'MON, MAN, I DON'T
SEE YOU DOING ANYTHING.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.399
I CAN'T.

24:37.400 --> 24:39.823
I HAVE TO
CLEAN A BUDDHA.

24:41.160 --> 24:43.458
HE LOOKS LIKE
HE'S ASLEEP.

24:46.560 --> 24:47.720
HE'S NOT.

24:47.730 --> 24:49.254
HE'S JUST
BLISSED OUT

24:49.260 --> 24:51.421
BECAUSE HE HAS THE SECRET
TO ENLIGHTENMENT.

24:51.430 --> 24:52.795
WHAT'S ENLIGHTENMENT ?

24:52.800 --> 24:55.291
IT'S, UH...

24:55.300 --> 24:58.121
I GUESS IT'S
KNOWING EVERYTHING.

24:58.130 --> 25:00.121
MY DAD
KNOWS EVERYTHING.

25:00.130 --> 25:02.951
WELL, HE KNOWS A LOT.

25:02.960 --> 25:06.521
HE KNOWS EVERYTHING,
HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW ?

25:07.830 --> 25:09.798
NOT MUCH.

25:12.060 --> 25:14.528
(loudtv)

25:14.530 --> 25:16.623
( knocking )

25:19.630 --> 25:21.689
( Ruth )
NIKOLAI ?

25:22.730 --> 25:24.197
(tv shutting off)

25:24.200 --> 25:25.292
RUTHIE ?

25:25.300 --> 25:26.927
DID WE HAVE PLANS ?

25:26.930 --> 25:28.158
NO.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.958
DOES THAT MEAN
I HAVE TO GO AWAY ?

25:33.730 --> 25:36.927
I DO NOT NEED MY HOUSE
TO SMELL LIKE FAKE LEMONS.

25:36.930 --> 25:38.750
IT SMELLS
GOOD ALREADY.

25:38.760 --> 25:40.057
NO, IT DOESN'T.

25:40.060 --> 25:42.654
I LIKE EVERYTHING
THE WAY IT IS.

25:42.660 --> 25:44.218
BUT I DON'T.

25:50.230 --> 25:52.926
I THOUGHT I WOULD...

25:52.930 --> 25:54.557
ISN'T THIS FUN ?

25:54.560 --> 25:56.755
IT'S A SURPRISE
SLEEP-OVER.

25:58.560 --> 26:01.097
OKAY, LET'S DO IT, SURE.

26:01.100 --> 26:03.250
THEN LET'S GET STARTED.

26:03.260 --> 26:04.329
OKAY.

26:04.330 --> 26:06.298
FIRST WE HAVE
TO GET THIS PLACE INTO SHAPE

26:06.300 --> 26:08.689
SO WE CAN HAVE A NICE,
COZY, CLEAN EVENING.

26:08.700 --> 26:10.850
WE'RE GOING
TO WALLPAPER ?

26:10.860 --> 26:11.758
NO, SILLY.

26:11.760 --> 26:13.899
IT'S CONTACT PAPER
FOR THE DRAWERS.

26:13.900 --> 26:19.054
RUTHIE, WHY DO I WANT LITTLE
CHERRIES IN MY DRAWERS ?

26:19.060 --> 26:21.324
IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN.

26:21.330 --> 26:22.991
YOU JUST DO.

26:24.360 --> 26:26.089
YOU FAILED ME ?

26:26.100 --> 26:28.523
I'M SORRY, CLAIRE, BUT I ASKED
FOR A LITERARY ANALYSIS.

26:28.530 --> 26:30.725
SO, YOU DIDN'T THINK
THEY WERE ANY GOOD ?

26:30.730 --> 26:33.153
THAT'S NOT THE POINT,
THIS IS AN ENGLISH CLASS.

26:33.160 --> 26:34.991
I WANTED
SOMETHING IN ENGLISH.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.456
OH, SO,
YOU'D JUST PREFER

26:36.460 --> 26:38.223
I DOWNLOAD SOME STUPID CRAP
OFF THE INTERNET

26:38.230 --> 26:40.391
THAN DO SOMETHING
THAT'S ACTUALLY CREATIVE ?

26:40.400 --> 26:42.823
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

26:42.830 --> 26:44.923
WOULD YOU JUST
DO THE MAKE-OVER ?

26:51.860 --> 26:54.499
I WAS REALLY HAPPY
WITH MRS. SIBLEY.

26:54.500 --> 26:57.128
"THE SECRET OF WOMAN,
THE SOIL.

26:57.130 --> 27:01.021
MY SECRET: UNDER A MOUND
THAT YOU SHALL NEVER FIND."

27:06.500 --> 27:09.526
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I PUT A LOT OF MYSELF INTO THIS.

27:09.530 --> 27:11.589
I WASN'T JUST
SLACKING OFF.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.522
LOOK, I DON'T
WANT TO FAIL YOU.

27:13.530 --> 27:15.589
JUST GIVE ME
SOME KIND OF PAPER.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.420
I ASSUME YOU NEED
TO GRADUATE.

27:17.430 --> 27:19.022
YOU ARE GOING
TO COLLEGE, RIGHT ?

27:19.030 --> 27:20.452
YUP, EAST VALLEY.

27:20.460 --> 27:22.519
OH, REALLY ?
I WENT THERE.

27:28.900 --> 27:30.151
( phone )

27:32.230 --> 27:33.697
DAVID FISHER...

27:33.700 --> 27:35.019
( Keith )
Hey, it's me.

27:35.030 --> 27:36.156
OH, HI.

27:36.160 --> 27:38.025
I'M CALLING TO TELL YOU
WE'RE HAVING LUNCH

27:38.030 --> 27:40.453
WITH TAYLOR AND KARLA
ON SATURDAY.

27:40.460 --> 27:43.497
YOU CAN'T JUST SCHEDULE THINGS
WITHOUT ASKING ME FIRST.

27:43.500 --> 27:45.422
THAT'S NOT
WHAT COUPLES DO.

27:45.430 --> 27:47.057
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW
WHAT COUPLES DO ?

27:47.060 --> 27:48.459
I watch tv.

27:48.460 --> 27:50.121
Or at least I used to,

27:50.130 --> 27:52.155
WHEN I HAD A COMFORTABLE CHAIR
TO SIT IN.

27:52.160 --> 27:54.355
Listen, I was in the middle
of five things at work, okay ?

27:54.360 --> 27:56.794
YOU KNOW, NOT EVERYONE
CAN ALWAYS ACT SO PERFECT.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.028
YEAH, I KNOW THAT.

27:58.030 --> 28:00.294
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING
TO TELL YOU LAST NIGHT.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.719
YOU SHOULD CHECK WITH ME
BEFORE YOU SAY YES TO THINGS.

28:04.730 --> 28:06.152
ARE YOU AVAILABLE ?

28:06.160 --> 28:07.650
Yes.

28:07.660 --> 28:10.197
THEN PRETEND
I ASKED YOU FIRST.

28:14.430 --> 28:16.751
SO, I WENT
THE ONE TIME,

28:16.760 --> 28:19.627
BUT I'M NOT GOING BACK
TO DR. MICHAELSON.

28:19.630 --> 28:21.996
ARE YOU ANNOYED ?

28:22.000 --> 28:24.321
WHY WOULD
I BE ANNOYED ?

28:24.330 --> 28:26.150
YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

28:26.160 --> 28:28.253
I'M SURE SHE'S GOOD,
SHE'S JUST NOT FOR ME.

28:28.260 --> 28:31.718
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
SHE WAS SO SERIOUS.

28:31.730 --> 28:34.699
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE
LOOKING FOR LAUGHS.

28:36.460 --> 28:39.156
I CAN ASK AROUND
FOR MORE NAMES.

28:39.160 --> 28:41.799
MY FRIEND PAULA'S
BEEN TO 40 SHRINKS.

28:41.800 --> 28:44.849
ALTHOUGH, I GUESS THAT'S NOT
THE BEST ENDORSEMENT FOR THEM.

28:44.860 --> 28:46.828
I'M FINE.

28:46.830 --> 28:50.493
I THINK I'M THE ONLY ONE
THAT CAN SOLVE
ANY OF MY PROBLEMS.

28:50.500 --> 28:53.219
YEAH, WE ARE ULTIMATELY
STUCK WITH OURSELVES.

28:53.230 --> 28:55.198
IT'S SO FUCKING
PU RITANICAL,

28:55.200 --> 28:57.122
HOW WE'RE CONDITIONED

28:57.130 --> 28:59.621
TO BUY INTO THE WHOLE
TRUE LOVE MONOGAMY CRAP.

28:59.630 --> 29:01.655
HEY, YOU'RE PREACHING
TO THE CHOIR.

29:02.660 --> 29:05.151
SO, I'VE BEEN THINKING

29:05.160 --> 29:07.822
THE NEXT TIME
THAT I FEEL ADVENTUROUS...

29:07.830 --> 29:10.492
WHAT IF
I INCLUDE NATE ?

29:10.500 --> 29:12.798
THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

29:12.800 --> 29:15.826
YOU REMEMBER TERRY
FROM ORANGE COUNTY
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT ?

29:15.830 --> 29:19.550
YES, YOU DO,
SHE HAS THE LIFESTYLE PARTIES
ON THE WEEKEND.

29:19.560 --> 29:20.720
OH, RIGHT, RIGHT.

29:20.730 --> 29:22.618
SHE AND HER HUSBAND
HAVE A COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP,

29:22.630 --> 29:24.495
THEY HAVE SEX
WITH STRANGERS ONCE A WEEK.

29:24.500 --> 29:26.092
THEY'RE REALLY HAPPY.

29:26.100 --> 29:28.159
MONOGAMY JUST
ISN'T FOR EVERYONE.

29:28.160 --> 29:30.424
I KNOW,
LOOK AT MY PARENTS.

29:30.430 --> 29:32.728
ACTUALLY, DON'T LOOK AT THEM,
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT.

29:35.500 --> 29:38.856
SO, MAYBE WE COULD GO TO TERRY'S
THIS WEEKEND AND CHECK IT OUT.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.919
WHATEVER, I'LL GIVE
YOU THE ADDRESS.

29:40.930 --> 29:42.750
I HOPE YOU
AND NATE LIKE IT.

29:42.760 --> 29:44.489
OH, I DON'T
WANT TO BRING NATE.

29:44.500 --> 29:46.297
I MEAN, NOT YET.

29:46.300 --> 29:49.019
FIRST YOU AND I SHOULD
GO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.829
OKAY...

30:02.830 --> 30:05.298
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

30:05.300 --> 30:08.098
IT FEELS LIKE
A WHOLE NEW PLACE.

30:08.100 --> 30:09.055
YES.

30:09.060 --> 30:10.698
IT REALLY DOES.

30:11.700 --> 30:14.055
WHO AM I KIDDING ?

30:15.000 --> 30:16.649
I CAN'T STAY HERE.

30:16.660 --> 30:19.356
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO STAY HERE.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.419
IT'S TOO DANK.

30:21.430 --> 30:23.728
IT WILL
ALWAYS BE DANK.

30:23.730 --> 30:26.995
I'M ONLY HUMAN,
I CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.128
NIKOLAI,
THIS IS CRAZY.

30:30.130 --> 30:32.257
WHY AREN'T YOU
MOVING INTO MY HOUSE ?

30:32.260 --> 30:34.023
I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S...

30:34.030 --> 30:36.999
WHY ARE YOU ACTING LIKE
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS ?

30:37.000 --> 30:38.422
WE HAVEN'T,
HAVE WE ?

30:38.430 --> 30:40.421
I GUESS IT'S JUST
BEEN ON MY MIND.

30:40.430 --> 30:42.990
I LIKE HOW THINGS HAVE BEEN
FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.025
I LIKE SEEING YOU
EVERY NIGHT AND MORNING.

30:45.030 --> 30:46.827
I DON'T WANT
TO GO BACKWARD, DO YOU ?

30:49.200 --> 30:50.394
RUTHIE...

30:53.660 --> 30:56.527
RUTHIE,
I LOVE YOU.

30:58.830 --> 31:02.129
I WISH YOU DIDN'T SOUND
SO SAD WHEN YOU SAY THAT.

31:02.130 --> 31:05.224
I WISH I WANTED
TO MOVE IN WITH YOU

31:05.230 --> 31:07.448
AND BE WITH YOU
ALL THE TIME.

31:07.460 --> 31:10.327
I WANT TO WANT THAT
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

31:10.330 --> 31:12.127
BUT...

31:12.130 --> 31:14.223
BUT I DON'T.

31:14.230 --> 31:17.222
MAYBE I AM THE ONE
WITH THE PROBLEM.

31:17.230 --> 31:21.326
MAYBE I HAVE BEEN ALONE
AND CUT OFF FOR SO LONG

31:21.330 --> 31:24.322
THAT I NO LONGER
KNOW HOW TO DO IT.

31:24.330 --> 31:27.356
MAYBE I AM NOT
CAPABLE OF IT.

31:29.460 --> 31:32.520
CAN'T WE GO ON AS WE WERE
BEFORE ACCIDENT ?

31:34.160 --> 31:36.890
I THINK
I SHOULD GO HOME.

31:42.330 --> 31:44.252
( door closing )

31:46.700 --> 31:49.453
DIDN'T MOM LEAVE
ANY REAL FOOD FOR DINNER ?

31:49.460 --> 31:52.657
NO, THERE WAS JUST A NOTE SAYING
SHE WAS GONE FOR THE NIGHT.

31:53.830 --> 31:57.129
SO, WHY AREN'T YOU TWO
WITH YOUR LOVED ONES ?

31:57.130 --> 31:59.394
LATE SHIFT.
SHIATSU APPOINTMENT.

32:03.030 --> 32:04.327
WHAT'S THIS ?

32:04.330 --> 32:05.490
OH, GIVE ME THAT.

32:05.500 --> 32:06.922
IT'S THIS THING
FOR SCHOOL.

32:06.930 --> 32:08.295
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

32:08.300 --> 32:10.791
DAVID,
LOOK AT THESE.

32:12.130 --> 32:14.394
THAT'S MRS. STEINER.

32:16.630 --> 32:18.518
MR. THOMAS.

32:18.530 --> 32:20.555
THE HARRISONS.

32:20.560 --> 32:22.096
MR. BENSON.

32:22.100 --> 32:24.056
MRS. OROZCO.

32:24.060 --> 32:26.528
GOD, RICO DID
AN AMAZING JOB ON HER.

32:27.430 --> 32:29.648
DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE ANY GOOD ?

32:29.660 --> 32:31.355
I THINK
THEY FUCKING SUCK !

32:31.360 --> 32:34.227
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT KIND
OF LAWSUIT THIS COULD BRING US ?

32:34.230 --> 32:36.289
WHAT KIND OF STUPID,
FUCKED UP CHILD ARE YOU ?!

32:36.300 --> 32:39.053
I WAS JUST TRYING TO DO
SOMETHING I GAVE A SHIT ABOUT !

32:39.060 --> 32:40.527
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE ?

32:41.860 --> 32:44.055
NATE, I HEARD
YOU YELLING.

32:44.060 --> 32:46.449
SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON.

32:46.460 --> 32:47.654
NOTHING.

32:47.660 --> 32:49.252
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SPENDING THE NIGHT OUT.

32:49.260 --> 32:51.490
WHY ARE YOU
BACK SO SOON ?

32:51.500 --> 32:53.718
THAT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

33:10.560 --> 33:13.791
HEY, GOT SOME CHANGE ?

33:14.730 --> 33:16.493
FUCK YOU, TOO !

33:18.060 --> 33:20.221
YOU'RE NOT
LISTENING TO ME.

33:20.230 --> 33:23.199
I SAID THIS SHIRT FEELS FUNNY,
IT SCRATCHES MY NECK.

33:23.200 --> 33:24.394
TOO BAD.

33:24.400 --> 33:26.197
IT'S THE ONLY
CLEAN ONE YOU HAD

33:26.200 --> 33:27.656
AND I CAN'T
TAKE YOUR UNCLE'S BITCHING

33:27.660 --> 33:30.254
IF HE SO MUCH AS SEES ONE CRUMMY
LITTLE APPLE JUICE STAIN.

33:30.260 --> 33:32.148
I WANT TO GO BACK
AND GET MY YELLOW ONE.

33:32.160 --> 33:33.127
I SAID, NO.

33:33.130 --> 33:34.222
TURN AROUND, NOW !

33:34.230 --> 33:35.788
YOU DON'T TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.

33:35.800 --> 33:37.153
MOM !

33:41.660 --> 33:43.992
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING ?

33:44.000 --> 33:45.820
WE GOTTA
GET OUT OF HERE.

33:50.360 --> 33:54.490
( Parker)
I HAD NO IDEA EAST VALLEY
WAS SO CLOSE TO THE FREEWAY.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.092
IT'S VERY
CONVENIENT.

33:56.100 --> 33:57.897
THAT'S THE
STUDENT CENTER.

33:57.900 --> 33:59.754
THAT'S WHERE
YOUR MAILBOX WILL BE.

33:59.760 --> 34:00.954
GREAT.

34:00.960 --> 34:03.349
I CAN GO THERE
AND GET LETTERS FROM PEOPLE,

34:03.360 --> 34:06.249
BEGGING ME
NOT TO KILL MYSELF.

34:06.260 --> 34:08.694
I BET YOU SOME
FAMOUS PEOPLE WENT HERE.

34:08.700 --> 34:10.258
SOMEONE LIKE...

34:10.260 --> 34:11.852
DAVID SPADE.

34:15.430 --> 34:17.648
OKAY, THERE'S WAY
TOO MANY FLYERS

34:17.660 --> 34:19.719
WITH THE WORD "BAPTIST"
ON THEM.

34:20.700 --> 34:24.488
LOOK, YOU CAN MAKE EXTRA MONEY
AS A PHONE SEX OPERATOR.

34:24.500 --> 34:26.491
YEAH, BAPTIST
PHONE SEX.

34:26.500 --> 34:30.391
IT SAYS HERE THEY HAVE
A REALLY GOOD ARTS CENTER.

34:30.400 --> 34:33.619
OH, NO, IT'S UNDER CONSTRUCTION,
IT WON'T BE OPEN UNTIL 2004.

34:34.600 --> 34:35.749
OH.

34:36.800 --> 34:38.791
THAT'S OKAY.

34:38.800 --> 34:42.292
I NEED TO START BEING MORE
CONNECTED TO THE REAL WORLD.

34:42.300 --> 34:45.258
I'M THINKING ABOUT TAKING
SOME BUSINESS COURSES.

34:52.430 --> 34:54.955
MOMMY, WE HAVE TO--

34:54.960 --> 34:56.791
JUST SHUT UP.

34:56.800 --> 34:58.358
I NEED TO THINK.

34:58.360 --> 35:00.692
OKAY,
NOTHING THERE.

35:00.700 --> 35:02.554
I THINK
NOTHING'S THERE.

35:02.560 --> 35:04.721
WHERE HAVE I MISSED,
WHERE HAVE I MISSED ?

35:04.730 --> 35:06.823
I DON'T WANT ANYONE
TO BE ABLE TO FIND ANYTHING.

35:06.830 --> 35:08.457
NO, WE DON'T.
WE HAVE
TO TELL THE COPS.

35:08.460 --> 35:10.553
WE JUST GOT TO PRAY
NOBODY SAW US.

35:11.700 --> 35:13.395
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.

35:13.400 --> 35:15.391
WE CAN'T
HELP HIM NOW.

35:15.400 --> 35:17.152
WE HAVE
TO TELL SOMEBODY.

35:17.160 --> 35:18.422
NO, WE DON'T !

35:18.430 --> 35:21.854
GOD, I AM SO TIRED, I AM SO
FUCKING TIRED OF THIS SHIT !

35:21.860 --> 35:24.328
WHY CAN'T I EVER
HAVE SOME FUCKING PEACE ?

35:31.800 --> 35:33.051
BABY,

35:33.060 --> 35:35.722
WE CAN'T
TELL THE COPS, OKAY ?

35:35.730 --> 35:37.891
THEY'LL TAKE ME
AWAY FROM YOU.

35:37.900 --> 35:40.391
DO YOU WANT THE COPS
TO TAKE ME AWAY FROM YOU ?

35:40.400 --> 35:41.549
NO.

35:41.560 --> 35:45.121
THEN WE DON'T
TELL THE COPS... OKAY ?

35:45.130 --> 35:48.327
THIS IS OUR LITTLE SECRET,
DO YOU HEAR ME ?

35:48.330 --> 35:51.219
OUR LITTLE SECRET.

35:52.500 --> 35:54.320
SAY IT.

35:54.330 --> 35:56.719
IT'S OUR
LITTLE SECRET.

36:04.260 --> 36:06.148
OF COURSE
THEY'RE LATE.

36:06.160 --> 36:08.754
AND I'VE GOT
A TURKEY BREAST DRYING UP.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.455
( loud yawning )

36:10.460 --> 36:13.293
OH, I'M SORRY,
AM I BORING YOU ?

36:13.300 --> 36:15.450
NO, I DIDN'T GET
ANY SLEEP LAST NIGHT

36:15.460 --> 36:17.553
BECAUSE YOU WERE
KICKING ME FOR HOURS.

36:17.560 --> 36:19.528
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
I HAVE NIGHTMARES !

36:19.530 --> 36:22.522
( doorbell )
IS THAT MY FAULT TOO,
LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE ?

36:27.800 --> 36:29.756
YOU'RE
40 MINUTES LATE.

36:29.760 --> 36:31.751
SORRY,
SOMETHING CAME UP.

36:34.900 --> 36:36.151
DAVID !

36:36.160 --> 36:37.821
HEY, LITTLE GIRL.

36:39.100 --> 36:41.853
WELL, FUCK, BREN, IT'S JUST
THAT IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT

36:41.860 --> 36:44.852
AND I THOUGHT WE PLANNED TO
ON SATURDAY NIGHT--

36:44.860 --> 36:48.591
YEAH, I KNOW YOU HAVE
THE SHITTY SHOWER TOMORROW.

36:52.160 --> 36:53.798
ALRIGHT.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.427
NO, JUST STAY AT HOME

36:55.430 --> 36:59.196
AND TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF, ALRIGHT ?

37:00.530 --> 37:02.418
ALRIGHT, BYE.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.921
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T
JUMP SO HARD.

37:10.930 --> 37:12.249
WHAT IF
HE CATCHES US ?

37:12.260 --> 37:13.522
I DON'T CARE.

37:13.530 --> 37:15.748
TAYLOR,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

37:15.760 --> 37:18.695
MY MOM RAN OVER SOMEBODY
ON WASHINGTON.

37:19.860 --> 37:21.054
WHAT ?

37:21.060 --> 37:23.199
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

37:23.200 --> 37:25.452
IT WAS AN OLD BALD
WHITE GUY.

37:25.460 --> 37:28.190
BUT WE'RE NOT
GOING TO TELL ANYBODY,
IT'S A SECRET.

37:28.200 --> 37:30.851
BUT SECRETS
ARE SO STUPID.

37:30.860 --> 37:33.294
PEOPLE ALWAYS
FIND OUT ABOUT SECRETS.

37:34.530 --> 37:36.521
OH, MY GOD.

37:37.630 --> 37:39.848
I WAS JUST KIDDING.

37:39.860 --> 37:42.897
I GOT YOU,
I GOT YOU GOOD.

37:42.900 --> 37:45.698
TAYLOR,
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

37:45.700 --> 37:47.327
YES, IT IS.

37:50.660 --> 37:55.029
( music playing )

37:55.030 --> 37:58.898
THIS IS EVEN MORE OF A SHITBOX
THAN I REMEMBERED.

37:58.900 --> 38:02.097
DO YOU WANT TO
GET OUT OF HERE WHILE
THERE'S STILL TIME TO RUN ?

38:02.100 --> 38:04.489
ARE YOU KIDDING ?
THIS IS FANTASTIC.

38:04.500 --> 38:07.549
( female )
MELISSA, YOU MADE IT !

38:09.260 --> 38:12.696
HEY, TERRY,
LOOK AT YOU, GIRL.

38:20.900 --> 38:23.289
SEX IS
SO STUPID.

38:23.300 --> 38:26.053
THIS IS LIKE
THESE PARTIES

38:26.060 --> 38:28.221
MY PARENTS USED TO HAVE
WHEN I WAS A KID.

38:28.230 --> 38:31.449
THERE WAS ALWAYS THIS REALLY
WEIRD ENERGY IN THE AIR,

38:31.460 --> 38:33.394
JUST LIKE TONIGHT.

38:33.400 --> 38:36.153
AH, YES, THE HEAW HAZE
OF EXPECT ANCY.

38:36.160 --> 38:38.094
EVERYONE WOULD
GET REALLY DRUNK,

38:38.100 --> 38:39.692
GET ALL HAN DSY.

38:40.830 --> 38:43.549
ALTHOUGH, I DON'T THINK
THEY WERE OFFICIAL SEX PARTIES
LIKE THIS ONE.

38:45.460 --> 38:47.928
WE SHOULD MINGLE.

38:51.360 --> 38:52.952
THIS SHIT'S AMAZING.

38:52.960 --> 38:55.758
I FOUND IT IN MY KID'S ROOM
AND BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF HIM.

38:55.760 --> 38:57.990
DON'T GET ME STARTED
ON MY KIDS.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.558
THEY LEAVE THE HOUSE
AT ALL HOURS,

38:59.560 --> 39:01.425
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THEY'RE UP TO.

39:01.430 --> 39:03.591
IF I THINK ABOUT IT
TOO HARD, I COULD CRY.

39:14.800 --> 39:17.655
( loud moaning )

39:27.530 --> 39:29.998
WHY ARE YOU
GETTING SO UPSET ?!

39:30.000 --> 39:31.797
I'M JUST SAYING,
ISN'T IT WEIRD

39:31.800 --> 39:33.893
THAT TAYLOR WOULD MAKE UP
THIS KIND OF A STORY ?

39:33.900 --> 39:35.322
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME THIS EARLIER ?!

39:35.330 --> 39:37.127
BECAUSE YOU WERE
GOING ON AND ON

39:37.130 --> 39:39.098
ABOUT THAT STUPID COFFEE STAIN
ON YOUR PRECIOUS COUCH.

39:39.100 --> 39:40.795
IT WAS ME, OKAY ?
I DID IT.

39:40.800 --> 39:42.199
I'M SORRY,
IT WAS ME.

39:42.200 --> 39:44.498
NOW SHUT UP ALREADY
ABOUT THE COFFEE STAIN.

39:46.260 --> 39:48.899
DON'T CALL HER,
LET'S JUST FORGET IT.

39:48.900 --> 39:50.856
IT'S JUST THIS WEIRD THING
TAYLOR SAID.

39:50.860 --> 39:52.953
I'M NOT CALLING HER,
IDIOT.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.591
( door slamming )

39:57.830 --> 39:58.854
HELLO ?

40:14.760 --> 40:15.897
HELLO...

40:17.000 --> 40:18.627
CAN I HELP YOU ?

40:18.630 --> 40:20.723
HI, YOU KILLED ME.

40:20.730 --> 40:23.324
IT WAS ABOUT
SEVEN YEARS AGO,
REMEMBER ?

40:23.330 --> 40:25.525
YOU DROVE LISA
TO HAVE ME KILLED.

40:25.530 --> 40:27.122
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

40:27.130 --> 40:29.394
I DON'T HARBOR
ANY BAD FEELINGS
OR ANYTHING.

40:29.400 --> 40:31.356
I'M PRO-CHOICE.

40:31.360 --> 40:34.591
WELL, AT LEAST I WOULD BE,
IF I WERE ALIVE.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.898
YOU KILLED
ME TOO.

40:37.900 --> 40:40.289
ACTUALLY, I WAS MISCARRIED
BY THE GIRL

40:40.300 --> 40:43.622
WHO WORKED AT
THAT STARBUCKS ON FREMONT.

40:43.630 --> 40:47.191
I DON'T THINK SHE WAS EVER
PLANNING TO TELL YOU ABOUT ME.

40:48.900 --> 40:51.789
YEAH, YEAH, MOM WAS
YOUR FIRST REAL GIRLFRIEND,

40:51.800 --> 40:53.324
THEN I CAME ALONG.

40:53.330 --> 40:55.150
YOU GUYS OFFED ME
AND THEN BROKE UP.

40:57.030 --> 40:58.497
( children laughing )

40:58.500 --> 41:00.627
EXCUSE ME.

41:03.100 --> 41:04.795
HI, DADDY.

41:05.930 --> 41:06.999
HI.

41:12.360 --> 41:15.056
WHO WANTS
COOKIES AND MILK ?

41:21.530 --> 41:23.828
I KNOW THE SECRET
TO EVERYTHING.

41:23.830 --> 41:27.288
BUT YOU'LL NEVER KNOW IT
BECAUSE YOU KILLED US.

41:43.500 --> 41:46.856
HIT AND RUN
AT WASHINGTON AND THIRD.

41:46.860 --> 41:50.159
THE VEHICLE'S DESCRIPTION
MATCHES KARLA'S CAR.

41:50.160 --> 41:52.890
THE OLD BALD
WHITE GUY

41:52.900 --> 41:54.891
WAS DEAD BEFORE
HE GOT TO CEDARS.

41:54.900 --> 41:57.152
OH, MY GOD.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.695
WHAT DO WE DO ?

42:02.700 --> 42:04.918
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU THINK WE DO ?

42:04.930 --> 42:08.024
( male )
MARLY AND I WERE
FIGHTING NIGHT AND DAY.

42:08.030 --> 42:10.498
AND THEN WE CAME
TO ONE OF THESE PARTIES.

42:10.500 --> 42:13.458
IT WAS LIKE
WE REDISCOVERED EACH OTHER.

42:13.460 --> 42:17.248
AND THINGS HAVE BEEN HOT
BETWEEN US EVER SINCE.

42:17.260 --> 42:19.694
THAT'S SUCH
A HEARTWARMING STORY.

42:20.930 --> 42:23.922
SOME PEOPLE JUST NEED A LITTLE
EXTRA HELP TO STAY TOGETHER.

42:23.930 --> 42:26.455
THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH THAT.

42:26.460 --> 42:29.452
( male )
I'M FOR GETTING
ALL THE HELP I CAN GET.

42:29.460 --> 42:31.223
OH, MARLY,

42:31.230 --> 42:33.824
SHOW THE GALS THAT THING
I GOT YOU FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.

42:33.830 --> 42:34.922
OH.

42:34.930 --> 42:37.251
THIS HAS GIVEN US
AT LEAST ANOTHER FIVE YEARS.

42:37.260 --> 42:39.820
OH, THIS SOUNDS GOOD,
SHOULD WE GUESS WHAT IT IS ?

42:39.830 --> 42:41.320
NO, NO,
I'LL TELL YOU.

42:41.330 --> 42:43.696
IT'S THIS LITTLE GIZMO
THAT HE GOT ON-LINE

42:43.700 --> 42:45.292
AT A SEX WEBSITE.

42:45.300 --> 42:49.521
AND, WELL, YOU'VE JUST GOT TO
SEE IT TO BELIEVE IT.

42:49.530 --> 42:51.157
I CAN'T WAIT.

42:51.160 --> 42:52.525
I CAN.

42:52.530 --> 42:55.795
I'M GONNA
GET ANOTHER DRINK.

42:55.800 --> 42:57.688
I CAN'T FIND IT.

42:58.760 --> 43:01.957
I'LL JUST KILL MYSELF
IF I LOST THAT.

43:01.960 --> 43:04.258
WHY DO I LOSE
EVERYTHING ?

43:04.260 --> 43:05.818
YOU PROBABLY LEFT IT
IN YOUR COAT.

43:05.830 --> 43:08.492
I THINK WE LEFT THEM
IN THAT ROOM OVER THERE.

43:14.030 --> 43:16.692
I'LL JUST GO HELP MARLY
FOR A SECOND.

43:17.900 --> 43:20.698
OR YOU COULD COME WITH US,
IF YOU WANT.

43:21.760 --> 43:23.523
OH!

43:30.130 --> 43:33.122
SURE,
I'LL HELP YOU.

43:55.760 --> 43:58.558
I JUST SAW MR. SRISAI'S
BROTHER-IN-LAW

43:58.560 --> 44:00.494
PUT 20 DOLLARS
IN THE CASKET.

44:00.500 --> 44:02.889
IT'S TRAVELING MONEY
FOR HIS JOURNEY.

44:02.900 --> 44:05.027
APPARENTLY,
UNLIKE THE REST OF US,

44:05.030 --> 44:07.624
BUDDHISTS CAN
TAKE IT WITH THEM.

44:08.630 --> 44:11.121
WHY AM I GIVING BRENDA
NAPKIN RINGS ?

44:11.130 --> 44:13.428
BECAUSE THAT'S ALL I HAD
IN THE GIFT CLOSET.

44:19.030 --> 44:20.520
HEY...

44:20.530 --> 44:23.397
THEY'RE ALLOWED TO TAKE PICTURES
OF THE DEAD GUY, BUT I'M NOT ?

44:23.400 --> 44:25.322
THAT'S RIGHT,
THEY'RE FAMILY.

44:25.330 --> 44:26.922
CLAIRE, WE'RE GOING
TO BE LATE.

44:26.930 --> 44:28.955
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I HAVE TO GO TO THIS THING.

44:28.960 --> 44:30.825
ALRIGHT, LOOK,
I'M SORRY.

44:30.830 --> 44:32.457
ON THE PLUS SIDE,

44:32.460 --> 44:34.348
I'LL BET IT'LL ONLY TAKE YOU
TWO SIPS OF MARGARET'S PUNCH

44:34.360 --> 44:36.521
BEFORE YOU'RE
COMPLETELY WASTED.

44:36.530 --> 44:39.021
THANKS, I'LL KEEP
THAT IN MIND.

44:40.300 --> 44:42.996
MORE PUNCH,
ANYONE ?

44:43.000 --> 44:45.389
YEAH, SURE,
I'LL TAKE ANOTHER HIT.

44:46.560 --> 44:48.448
THAT BRAT'S
OVER AN HOUR LATE.

44:48.460 --> 44:49.654
FOR THE LIFE OF ME,

44:49.660 --> 44:52.527
I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE GOT
SO DAMN PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE.

44:53.630 --> 44:55.928
ISN'T THAT JUST
BEING AGGRESSIVE ?

44:55.930 --> 44:57.591
ARE YOU SICK,
DEAR ?

44:57.600 --> 45:00.251
OR ARE YOU ALWAYS
THIS DEATHLY PALE ?

45:00.260 --> 45:01.852
( door opening )

45:05.360 --> 45:07.920
I'M NOT LATE,
AM I ?

45:07.930 --> 45:10.296
YOU MOST
CERTAIN LY ARE.

45:10.300 --> 45:14.418
ICE COLD MINI-ASPARAGUS
QUICHE, DARLING ?

45:18.600 --> 45:21.990
( Nate )
WHAT ARE THEY DOING WITH THOSE
LITTLE CUPS OF WATER ?

45:22.000 --> 45:23.888
IT'S A CLEANSING RITUAL.

45:23.900 --> 45:26.892
YOU RID YOURSELF OF ANY WRONGS
YOU'VE DONE TO THE DECEASED.

45:29.960 --> 45:32.451
YOU REALLY THINK
THAT CHANGES ANYTHING ?

45:32.460 --> 45:35.395
POURING A LITTLE
WATER INTO A BOWL ?

45:36.530 --> 45:38.828
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE.

45:39.960 --> 45:41.393
I HAVE TO GO.

45:41.400 --> 45:46.019
CAN YOU MAKE SURE THAT
THE MONKS GET HOME ALRIGHT ?

45:48.800 --> 45:51.758
OH, AND YOU'LL
POUR THE WATER OUT
FROM MR. SRISAI'S BOWL ?

45:51.760 --> 45:54.593
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO IT OVER
THE OLDEST TREE YOU CAN FIND.

45:54.600 --> 45:56.625
I USE THE ONE
OUT FRONT.

45:56.630 --> 45:59.224
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY ALWAYS
BRING SO MANY ORANGES.

45:59.230 --> 46:01.755
BUT IF THERE ARE ANY EXTRA,
GRAB SOME FOR THE PREP ROOM.

46:04.630 --> 46:07.053
THIS PUNCH
IS DELICIOUS.

46:07.060 --> 46:10.291
YOUR MOTHER MADE IT
WITH A LIQUEUR FROM BELIZE.

46:10.300 --> 46:14.896
IT'S SOME WORD
WITH A TILDE OVER THE "N".

46:17.460 --> 46:20.099
SO...
WHAT'S NEW ?

46:23.760 --> 46:25.728
ACTUALLY,
I SPENT ALL NIGHT

46:25.730 --> 46:29.097
DOING IT WITH THIS COUPLE
FROM ORANGE COUNTY,

46:29.100 --> 46:31.557
AND I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO IDEA WHY.

46:33.530 --> 46:36.294
IT WAS AT ONE OF THOSE
SEX THINGS, YOU KNOW ?

46:36.300 --> 46:38.120
LIFESTYLE PARTIES ?

46:38.130 --> 46:39.950
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

46:39.960 --> 46:41.825
THEY HAD
THIS LITTLE

46:41.830 --> 46:44.253
HIGH-TECH
JAPAN ESE VIBRATOR

46:44.260 --> 46:46.455
THAT STIMULATES
THE CLITORIS

46:46.460 --> 46:49.623
THROUGH VERY VERY LOW VOLTAGE
ELECTRICAL SHOCKS.

46:49.630 --> 46:53.088
ANYWAY, THEY INVITED ME,
YOU KNOW, TO GO WITH THEM,

46:53.100 --> 46:56.024
AND I THOUGHT, NOW,
THIS WOULD BE CROSSING A LINE.

46:56.030 --> 46:58.658
WHICH I SEEM TO BE DOING
MORE AND MORE THESE DAYS,

46:58.660 --> 47:00.423
BECAUSE
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

47:00.430 --> 47:02.694
THE LINES
ARE ONLY IN OUR HEADS.

47:02.700 --> 47:06.056
IN ACT UALITY,
THERE ARE NO LINES AT ALL,

47:06.060 --> 47:08.858
WHICH IS REALLY
FUCKING TERRIFYING
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

47:10.400 --> 47:11.549
( laughing )

47:11.560 --> 47:13.323
WHAT'S SO FUNNY ?

47:13.330 --> 47:15.628
NOTHING.

47:15.630 --> 47:17.825
EVERYTHING,
THIS...

47:20.700 --> 47:23.055
I WANT YOU
TO KNOW SOMETHING, BRENDA.

47:24.230 --> 47:26.949
I LOVE YOU.

47:28.500 --> 47:30.388
I LOVE YOU

47:30.400 --> 47:33.756
BECAUSE YOU ARE
SO INDEPENDENT AND SPIRITED

47:33.760 --> 47:37.093
AND YOU MAKE NO APOLOGIES
FOR YOURSELF.

47:37.960 --> 47:41.589
AND YOU KNOW
YOU CAN'T SMOTHER SOMEONE
OR YOU'LL LOSE THEM.

47:43.300 --> 47:46.497
YOU ACCEPT NATE AS HE IS
AND THAT IS BEAUTIFUL.

47:48.060 --> 47:50.449
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO THAT,

47:50.460 --> 47:52.690
NOT AT ALL.

47:53.830 --> 47:57.618
MAYBE THAT'S WHY
I RESENTED YOU SO MUCH.

47:57.630 --> 48:00.224
BUT, NOW I DON'T.

48:00.930 --> 48:03.148
NOW I ADMIRE YOU.

48:11.900 --> 48:13.151
THANK YOU.

48:14.700 --> 48:16.019
THAN KS.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.457
I HAVE TO
GO TO THE BATHROOM.

48:27.530 --> 48:31.091
CLAIRE, ARE YOU
FEELING ALRIGHT ?

48:31.100 --> 48:33.898
YEAH,
I'M JUST TIRED.

48:33.900 --> 48:37.358
LET ME FEEL
YOUR FOREHEAD.

48:40.460 --> 48:42.519
IT FEELS OKAY.

48:42.530 --> 48:44.748
I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU SHOULD BE TIRED.

48:44.760 --> 48:47.149
YOU SLEPT ALMOST
11 HOURS LAST NIGHT.

48:48.660 --> 48:51.549
I'M NOT REALLY LIKE
WANT TO GO TO SLEEP TIRED,

48:51.560 --> 48:54.620
I'M JUST SORT OF LIKE
SICK AND TIRED OF EVERYTHING.

48:54.630 --> 48:56.393
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

48:56.400 --> 48:58.391
JUST LIKE ALL
THE LIES WE'RE FED,

48:58.400 --> 49:00.129
AND THE BULLSHIT
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO CARE ABOUT,

49:00.130 --> 49:02.690
AND HOW EVERYBODY
IS SO SCARED OF ANYTHING

49:02.700 --> 49:05.453
THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM LIKE
EVERYTHING ELSE.

49:06.560 --> 49:08.721
I DON'T KNOW.

49:10.230 --> 49:13.154
I'M GONNA GET SOME COFFEE,
DO YOU WANT SOME ?

49:13.160 --> 49:15.628
I HAVE TO
USE THE BATHROOM.

49:19.960 --> 49:20.995
OH!

49:21.000 --> 49:22.797
YOU MUST BE RUTH.

49:22.800 --> 49:24.256
BERNARD CH ENOWITH.

49:24.260 --> 49:25.454
OH, HELLO.

49:25.460 --> 49:27.223
I'M SO SORRY
TO STARTLE YOU.

49:27.230 --> 49:29.698
I WAS SUPPOSED TO CONFINE MYSELF
TO THE MASTER SUITE,

49:29.700 --> 49:32.828
BUT MARGARET DOESN'T LIKE ME
TO USE HER BATHROOM.

49:32.830 --> 49:36.994
SHE GETS INSANELY TERRITORIAL
ABOUT THAT DAMN BIDET.

49:39.160 --> 49:42.049
WELL, IT'S NICE
TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

49:42.060 --> 49:43.197
I KNOW.

49:43.200 --> 49:44.895
I DON'T KNOW WHY
NATE AND BRENDA

49:44.900 --> 49:47.027
HAVEN'T ARRANGED
A DINNER OR SOMETHING.

49:47.030 --> 49:49.225
I COULD GIVE YOU
HALF A DOZEN REASONS

49:49.230 --> 49:51.425
JUST OFF
THE TOP OF MY HEAD.

49:51.430 --> 49:53.421
BUT I'D LIKE
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

49:53.430 --> 49:55.990
WHAT STEPS
HAVE YOU TAKEN

49:56.000 --> 49:58.423
TO TREAT
YOUR DAUGHTER'S DEPRESSION ?

49:58.430 --> 50:00.796
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

50:00.800 --> 50:03.553
SURELY YOU MUST BE
AWARE OF IT.

50:03.560 --> 50:06.028
NOW IF YOU'RE
ADVERSE TO TALK THERAPY,

50:06.030 --> 50:08.419
THERE ARE SCADS OF
PHARMACEUTICAL SOLUTIONS.

50:08.430 --> 50:10.523
EITHER WAY,
I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY

50:10.530 --> 50:12.555
TO RECOMMEND THE NAME
OF SOMEBODY SHE CAN SEE.

50:12.560 --> 50:15.427
I'M SORRY,
I HAVE TO USE THE BATHROOM !

50:16.760 --> 50:18.751
( door slamming )

50:23.500 --> 50:38.825
( monks chanting )

52:07.060 --> 52:09.096
YOU'RE BREAKING UP
WITH ME ?

52:09.100 --> 52:11.523
I'M SAYING I DON'T THINK
WE HAVE A HEALTHY FRIENDSHIP.

52:11.530 --> 52:13.555
WE SHOULDN'T
SEE EACH OTHER ANYMORE.

52:16.530 --> 52:19.055
I DON'T KNOW
HOW ELSE TO EXPLAIN IT.

52:19.060 --> 52:20.357
DON'T BOTH ER,
REALLY.

52:20.360 --> 52:22.328
I'M GOING THROUGH
SOMETHING RIGHT NOW.

52:22.330 --> 52:24.321
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.

52:24.330 --> 52:27.493
BUT I NEED TO BE AROUND PEOPLE
WHO AREN'T LIKE YOU.

52:27.500 --> 52:30.822
PEOPLE WHO HAVE
CLEAR VALUES OR SOMETHING.

52:30.830 --> 52:32.388
OKAY, GOT IT.

52:32.400 --> 52:34.288
YOU KNOW,
IF I HADN'T MET YOU,

52:34.300 --> 52:37.656
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN DOING ALL THE SHIT
I'VE BEEN DOING.

52:37.660 --> 52:39.196
NOT THAT
I BLAME YOU EXACTLY.

52:39.200 --> 52:40.292
OH, BROTHER.

52:40.300 --> 52:42.052
JUST CAN IT,
SWEETH EART.

52:42.060 --> 52:44.699
YOU CAN'T STAND TO SEE
THE TRUTH ABOUT YOURSELF,

52:44.700 --> 52:46.691
SO I'VE GOT TO
TAKE THE FALL.

52:47.700 --> 52:49.497
JUST DO ME A FAVOR,

52:49.500 --> 52:51.491
WHEN YOU FEEL BAD
ABOUT THIS LATER,

52:51.500 --> 52:54.298
YOU CAN SKIP THE BIG APOLOGY
AND TRYING TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN.

52:54.300 --> 52:57.497
IT WAS FUN,
BUT WE SHOULD BOTH MOVE ON.

53:04.960 --> 53:08.828
SO, NOW YOU KNOW
WHAT WAS REALLY GOING ON WITH ME
THAT NIGHT IN SEATTLE.

53:10.130 --> 53:13.827
SO, IS THE WESTERN MEDICINE
CONTROLLING THE SEIZURES ?

53:13.830 --> 53:15.695
NOT ENTIRELY.

53:19.360 --> 53:22.295
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
TELL YOU ABOUT THIS EARLIER.

53:23.630 --> 53:26.895
I THINK I WAS JUST
TRYING NOT TO FACE IT MYSELF.

53:29.730 --> 53:32.597
LISA,
I'VE CHANGED.

53:33.800 --> 53:36.894
I USED TO BE THIS PERSON WHO
RAN AWAY FROM RESPONSIBILITY,

53:36.900 --> 53:38.652
BUT I'M NOT HIM
ANYMORE.

53:45.460 --> 53:48.998
I WANT TO BE A PART
OF OUR CHILD'S LIFE.

53:50.530 --> 53:54.022
I REALLY WANT TO,
I NEED TO.

53:55.500 --> 53:59.527
IS THIS ABOUT YOU BEING
A FATHER FOR SOMEONE ?

53:59.530 --> 54:02.852
OR IS THIS ABOUT YOU BEING
SCARED OF DEATH ?

54:04.100 --> 54:05.897
DOES IT
REALLY MATTER ?

54:07.060 --> 54:09.028
MAYBE IT DOESN'T.

54:11.630 --> 54:16.351
THIS IS GOING TO
TAKE SOME ADJUSTING.

54:19.660 --> 54:23.653
OKAY, MAYBE WE CAN
WORK OUT SOMETHING.

54:25.130 --> 54:27.598
THIS IS WHAT
YOU WANT, RIGHT ?

54:27.600 --> 54:29.329
IT'S ABSOLUTELY
WHAT I WANT.

54:29.330 --> 54:31.890
IT'S NOT LIKE
BRENDA TOLD YOU

54:31.900 --> 54:34.892
THIS WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO
OR SOMETHING.

54:34.900 --> 54:36.492
NO, NO.

54:36.500 --> 54:38.957
SHE DOESN'T EVEN
KNOW ABOUT IT.

54:43.800 --> 54:45.893
WHAT ?

54:48.860 --> 54:51.351
NATE, YOU ARE SO...

54:52.600 --> 54:54.818
THIS IS NO GOOD.

54:54.830 --> 54:56.923
I JUST WANT TO
GET AWAY FROM YOU.

54:56.930 --> 54:58.659
LOOK, I DON'T UNDERSTAND,
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

54:58.660 --> 55:00.150
I WAS SO STUPID

55:00.160 --> 55:02.492
TO THINK THAT ANYTHING
COULD EVER CHANGE YOU.

55:02.500 --> 55:04.456
YOU DON'T
WANT A CHILD,

55:04.460 --> 55:07.099
SO YOU AGREE NOT TO BE
A PART OF THAT CHILD'S LIFE.

55:07.100 --> 55:09.125
THEN YOU DECIDE
YOU DO WANT A CHILD

55:09.130 --> 55:11.098
AND YOU SAY YOU WANT TO BE
A PART OF THAT CHILD'S LIFE

55:11.100 --> 55:12.897
WITH A TOTAL DISREGARD

55:12.900 --> 55:15.198
FOR THE PERSON YOU'RE SUPPOSEDLY
SHARING A LIFE WITH.

55:15.200 --> 55:16.519
JESUS, NATE,
LISA, ALL I SAID--

55:16.530 --> 55:18.953
IF YOU CAN'T EVER PUT
ANYONE ELSE BUT YOURSELF FIRST,

55:18.960 --> 55:20.621
HOW CAN YOU
BE A FATHER ?

55:20.630 --> 55:21.858
YOU CAN'T.

55:21.860 --> 55:24.499
SO, JUST DO US BOTH A FAVOR
AND STAY OUT OF OUR LIVES.

55:24.500 --> 55:25.592
PLEASE.
