- HOW DARK?

01:28.822 --> 01:30.558
- LIKE DARTH VADER
WITH TITS DARK.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.726

SHE'S GONNA SAY NEXT.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.495

THE IMAGINATION

01:45.806 --> 01:47.508
TO MAKE UP A SEXUAL PATHOLOGY
THAT STRANGE AND THAT BORING.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.777

IT'S THAT DOCTOR
WHO PUT IN THAT HIP REPLACEMENT.

I HAVE TO GO TO THE DOCTOR.

I GET BUTTERFLIES IN MY STOMACH.

05:43.877 --> 05:44.912
- THOSE AREN'T BUTTERFLIES,
BRIAN.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.480
THAT'S THE VERY REAL FEAR

05:46.514 --> 05:47.848
THAT YOUR BODY PARTS
WILL BE FOUND

05:47.881 --> 05:48.916
IN SEVERAL PIECES

- FIND THE DIGIT, BRI.
- I'M ON IT.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.438
- LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.105
YOU EVER SEEN
THIS MANY BIRDHOUSES?

06:12.139 --> 06:14.207
DOES THIS LOOK SANE TO YOU?
- THEY'RE GIFTS, IRENE.

06:14.241 --> 06:16.076
GIFTS MEAN SOMETHING MORE WHEN
THEY'RE MADE PERSONAL.

- THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME.

06:17.545 --> 06:18.946
- IT'S MY BRAND.

- PEOPLE DO APPRECIATE
A HOMEMADE GIFT.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.550
- NO ONE WANTS A BIRDHOUSE.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.585

- HEY.

06:27.455 --> 06:28.756
CAN'T MAKE ANY GUARANTEES,

06:28.789 --> 06:30.691
BUT THEY MIGHT
BE ABLE TO REATTACH IT.

06:30.724 --> 06:31.425
- WE'RE GONNA DO OUR BEST TO GET
YOU BACK IN THE WORKSHOP

06:31.459 --> 06:33.026
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.562
- YOU THINK A MISSING FINGER IS
GONNA STOP THIS LUNATIC?

06:34.595 --> 06:36.897
HE ALREADY LOST ONE
ON THE OTHER HAND.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.132

06:39.166 --> 06:40.568
HE'S GOT SOME KIND OF DISORDER.

06:40.601 --> 06:41.869
- YOU GUYS WANT A BIRDHOUSE?

06:41.902 --> 06:43.437

THEY'RE SO BEAUTIFUL, SIR.

06:45.105 --> 06:46.874

BUT, YES, PLEASE TAKE
A BIRDHOUSE, ALL OF YOU.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.612
- AND TELL ALL YOUR FRIENDS.
I MAKE 'EM CUSTOM.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.246

06:53.280 --> 06:55.415
I'LL GRAB THE INSURANCE CARD
AND BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

06:55.449 --> 06:56.784
WHICH HOSPITAL
ARE YOU TAKING HIM TO?

06:56.817 --> 06:59.086
- UH, HOLY ASCENSION
IS THE CLOSEST.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.320
- TAKE HIM TO STREETERVILLE.

07:00.353 --> 07:01.455
THEY DID A NICE JOB
OF SEWING HIM UP

07:01.489 --> 07:03.256
WITH THE LAST ONE.
- WILL DO.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.993
- GOD, I LOVE
THAT SON OF A BITCH.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.127
- ALL RIGHT, HOW MANY BIRDHOUSES
EVERYBODY WANT?

07:07.160 --> 07:08.562
TWO?
- TWO.

07:08.596 --> 07:10.764
- TWO EACH?
- I'LL TAKE SIX.

07:10.798 --> 07:13.166
SECOND THOUGHT,
I'D LIKE TO PICK MINE OUT.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.109
- CAN YOU IMAGINE
HOW MUCH TIME YOU'D SAVE

07:22.142 --> 07:23.611
IF YOU NEVER HAD SEX?

07:23.644 --> 07:25.946
- YES.
- WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH IT?

07:25.979 --> 07:28.448
- WELL, I'D TRY
TO CHANNEL MY THOUGHTS.

07:28.482 --> 07:30.417
I'D THINK ABOUT
HOW LUCKY WE ARE

07:30.450 --> 07:32.586
TO LIVE IN THIS GREAT COUNTRY
OF OURS,

07:32.620 --> 07:35.923
AND ABOUT MY PARENTS
AND WORLD PEACE,

07:35.956 --> 07:38.792
AND ALL THE POOR AND
IMPOVERISHED PEOPLE OUT THERE.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.794
YOU?
- PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING.

07:40.828 --> 07:43.030
MINUS THE PARENTS
AND THE WORLD PEACE--

07:43.063 --> 07:44.197
AND THE--WHAT
WAS THE FIRST THING?

07:44.231 --> 07:46.033
- [laughs]

07:46.066 --> 07:47.167
- SO YOU JUST THINK ABOUT SEX
ALL DAY LONG?

07:47.200 --> 07:48.168
- NOT WHILE I'M EATING.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.703
OH, THAT'S A LIE.

07:49.737 --> 07:50.704
I JUST THOUGHT ABOUT
ROSARIO DAWSON'S ASS.

07:50.738 --> 07:53.874
- MM. WHY?
- WHY NOT?

07:53.907 --> 07:56.143
- AMBULANCE NEEDED.
3141 WEST CHASE.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.045
- OOH! AMBULANCE 14 RESPONDING!
- THAT'S HARRIET.

07:58.078 --> 07:59.680
- AMBULANCE 14 RESPONDING!
- THAT'S HARRIET!

07:59.713 --> 08:00.981
- GOD DAMN YOU GUYS!

08:01.014 --> 08:02.816
- DO YOU GUYS
WANNA TAKE THIS ONE?

08:02.850 --> 08:04.051
- DUDE, EVERY TIME.
- MAYBE--I'M JUST KIDDING.

08:04.084 --> 08:05.886
- YOU BETTER BRING ME
BACK SOME COOKIES!

08:13.894 --> 08:15.996
- I GUESS WE ALL KNEW SOME DAY
THIS CALL WOULD COME.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.298
- YEAH.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.667
- IT'S WEIRD,
BUT FOR SOME REASON

08:19.700 --> 08:21.134
I THOUGHT SHE'D OUTLIVE US ALL.
- MM.

08:21.168 --> 08:24.071
- AT LEAST SHE DIDN'T SUFFER.
- YEAH.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.238
- WELL, I'LL CALL THE CORONER.

08:25.272 --> 08:26.073
YOU GUYS START CLEANING UP.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.841
- HOLD UP.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.510
SLOW DOWN.

08:30.544 --> 08:34.014
LET'S JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY
GOOD-BYE TO OUR FRIEND, HARRIET.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.586
- GOOD-BYE, HARRIET.
- GOOD-BYE, HARRIET.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.020
- GLAD I GOT TO MEET YOU.

08:40.053 --> 08:42.155
- SHE WAS A GOOD PERSON.
- GREATEST GENERATION.

08:42.189 --> 08:44.257
- HMM.
[bell dings]

08:49.763 --> 08:51.064
I'LL GET THE COOKIES,
YOU GET THE MILK,

08:51.098 --> 08:53.200
YOU CALL THE CORONER.
- GOT IT.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.902
WE'RE EATING THE COOKIES?

08:54.935 --> 08:56.503
- OF COURSE WE ARE.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.938
THEY'RE THE LAST THING
THAT SHE MADE ON EARTH.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.339
- IT WOULD BE DISRESPECTFUL
NOT TO.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.440
- OKAY, BUT WE SHOULD
PROBABLY SAVE SOME

09:00.473 --> 09:01.575
FOR THE OTHER GUYS IN THE DEPOT.

09:01.609 --> 09:02.676
- YEAH, OBVIOUSLY.
- OF COURSE.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.011
- WE'RE NOT ANIMALS.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.045
- I MEAN,
CASH PRETTY MUCH INSISTED.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.347
both: WHO DO YOU THINK WE ARE?

09:07.380 --> 09:10.618
- SO YOU ATE ALL THE COOKIES?

09:10.651 --> 09:12.786
- I'M SORRY.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.121
- ALL THE GODDAMN COOKIES?

09:14.154 --> 09:17.124
- WE TRIED.
- WE REALLY DID.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.258
WE TRIED SO HARD.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.227
- I DIDN'T TRY.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.895
NONE OF US TRIED.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.931
YOU LICKED THE PLATE.
YOU KNOW THE DEAL.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.132
YOU GET THE CALL,
YOU GET THE COOKIES.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.433
- THAT IS THE DEAL.

09:26.466 --> 09:29.737
- BUT THOSE WERE
THE LAST COOKIES!

09:29.770 --> 09:32.640
THEY BETTER NOT
HAVE BEEN SNICKERDOODLES.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.775
IF THEY WERE SNICKERDOODLES,
LIE TO ME.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.814
- THEY WEREN'T SNICKERDOODLES.
- OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE KILLING ME.

09:40.848 --> 09:43.283
- CASH, I'M SORRY WE ATE
ALL THE COOKIES, MAN.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.085
BUT LET ME MAKE AMENDS

09:45.118 --> 09:47.420
BY TAKING YOU TO THE BEST
HOMEMADE DINNER YOU EVER HAD.

09:47.454 --> 09:49.222
- YOUR MOM DOING THE COOKING?
- YEP.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.457
- SHE'S CRAZY, RIGHT?

09:50.490 --> 09:53.293
- SHE NOT CRAZY...PER SE.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.763
- CRAZY'S A GOOD THING
IN THE KITCHEN.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.831
MY EX WAS BATSH--
IN THE BEDROOM,

09:57.865 --> 09:59.933
BUT IN THE KITCHEN
SHE WAS IRISH.

09:59.967 --> 10:02.936
OF ALL THE WHITE PEOPLE TO TAKE
AFTER WHEN IT COMES TO FOOD.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.172
BOILED MEAT, BOILED POTATOES.

10:05.205 --> 10:08.475
COULDN'T TASTE A DAMN THING
EXCEPT FOR THE WHISKEY.

10:08.508 --> 10:12.179
THANK GOD ALMIGHTY
FOR THE WHISKEY.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.413
AM I GONNA NEED WHISKEY TONIGHT?

10:13.446 --> 10:15.749
- HELL NO.
- I'M IN.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.818
- ALL RIGHT.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.924
- SO, I HEAR YOU MET
JOHNNY DEPP.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.926
- YEP.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.928
- I'M A BIG PIRATES
OF THE CARIBBEAN FAN.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.863
GOT MY FINGERS CROSSED
FOR NUMBER FIVE.

10:32.199 --> 10:36.603
WHAT, UH--
WHAT WAS HE LIKE?

10:36.636 --> 10:39.272
- HE HAD ON MORE EYE MAKEUP
THAN MY MOM WEARS

10:39.306 --> 10:42.142
AND SEVEN SCARVES.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.311
SEVEN SCARVES.

10:44.344 --> 10:47.681
AND SIX EARRINGS
AND HE SMELLED LIKE VANILLA.

10:47.715 --> 10:50.017
I LIKE MEN WHO LOOK
AND DRESS AND SMELL LIKE MEN.

10:54.888 --> 10:57.891
- SO, UH, I DID
SOME READING ON ASEXUALITY.

10:57.925 --> 11:00.060
DID YOU KNOW THAT THE SYMBOL
OF ASEXUALITY

11:00.093 --> 11:01.995
IS THE GREY TRIANGLE?

11:02.029 --> 11:03.797
- I'M JUST ASEXUAL, BRIAN.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.465
I DON'T MARCH
IN PARADES OR ANYTHING.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.400
- ARE THERE PARADES?
- I DON'T KNOW.

11:07.434 --> 11:08.335
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO DID THE RESEARCH.

11:08.368 --> 11:11.004
- RIGHT.

11:11.038 --> 11:13.540
I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF ASEXUAL.
I'M CELIBATE.

11:13.573 --> 11:15.542
- OH, YOU ARE?
FOR HOW LONG?

11:15.575 --> 11:17.344
- SINCE ME AND MY LAST
GIRLFRIEND BROKE UP.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.412
- OH, SEE THAT'S
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.248
YOU CAN'T GET LAID.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.050
I DON'T WANT TO.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.885
- WELL, YEAH, I'M SURE GUYS
ARE ALWAYS HITTING ON YOU.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.686
- NO, THEY DON'T.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.522
I GIVE OFF A VERY DISTINCT VIBE.
- WHICH IS?

11:29.556 --> 11:31.391
- DON'T HIT ON ME
OR I WILL KILL YOU.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.861
- OH, THANK GOD.

11:33.894 --> 11:36.563
I WAS WORRIED
THAT IT WAS JUST ME.

11:36.596 --> 11:39.166
LISTEN, MAYBE IT'S--YOU KNOW,

11:39.199 --> 11:41.268
THIS THING IS--
IS JUST A PHASE.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.702
- IT ISN'T JUST A PHASE.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.104
- OH, I KNOW YOU
DON'T THINK IT IS.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.506
I, FOR INSTANCE,
FOR YEARS AND YEARS

11:46.539 --> 11:48.441
THOUGHT I DIDN'T LIKE OLIVES.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.677
THEN ONE DAY I TRIED ONE.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.380
NOW I THINK OLIVES
ARE TREMENDOUS.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.983
- I LOVE OLIVES.

11:57.484 --> 11:58.952
[sniffs]

11:58.986 --> 12:01.789
- YEP.

12:01.822 --> 12:05.058
- YOU SMELL...SO BAD.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.259
- SORRY.

12:06.293 --> 12:07.961
LONG DAY ON THE RIG.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.930
- [sniffs]
NO, IT'S GOOD.

12:09.963 --> 12:12.032
I LIKE IT.
- YEAH?

12:12.065 --> 12:13.733
- BUT I DON'T LIKE SEX.
- MM.

12:13.767 --> 12:14.902
- AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE

12:14.935 --> 12:16.403
EVEN MORE THAN SEX?
- SCARVES?

12:16.436 --> 12:18.906
- TALKING ABOUT
HOW I DON'T LIKE IT.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.774
YOU SEEM LIKE A NICE GUY, BRIAN.

12:20.808 --> 12:23.143
AND IF YOU WANNA BE FRIENDS,
I'M COOL WITH IT.

12:23.176 --> 12:26.279
BUT SEX?
BLECH.

12:26.313 --> 12:30.050
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.451
- OKAY.

12:31.484 --> 12:34.287
NO SEX.
AWESOME.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.828
- GREAT, THANK YOU.

12:40.861 --> 12:43.964
- HEY, YOU MUST BE THERESA.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.432
- HI.
- OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE GORGEOUS.

12:45.465 --> 12:46.934
- YEAH.

12:46.967 --> 12:47.968
- GUESS WE KNOW
WHO DUMPED WHO, HUH?

12:48.001 --> 12:49.402
[laughs]

12:49.436 --> 12:51.138
- WHO'S THIS?
- THIS IS MY SON, JACK.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.974
JACK, THIS IS THERESA AND
YOUR UNCLE-BROTHER, JOHNNY.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.775
- HI, JACK.
- HI.

12:55.809 --> 12:59.012
- I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T--
- HE'S MY SON WITH COCO.

12:59.046 --> 13:00.780
- AND YOU GAVE HIM
THE SAME NAME AS ME?

13:00.814 --> 13:03.283
- NO, HIS NAME IS JACK,
YOUR NAME IS JOHN.

13:03.316 --> 13:04.651
TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

13:04.684 --> 13:05.518
- HI, UNCLE-BROTHER JOHNNY.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.154
- HEY...JACK.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.956
- HEY, PLAY SOME MADDEN NOW,
KIDDO.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.157
ATTABOY.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.425
YEAH, TURN IT UP
REALLY LOUD, YEAH.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.261
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S THE DEAL.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.328
I NEED YOU GUYS TO WATCH THE KID
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.

13:15.362 --> 13:16.663
- WHAT?
- OH--

13:16.696 --> 13:17.464
- I GOT A SURE THING
AT THE TRACK.

13:17.497 --> 13:18.498
IT'S NOT GONNA TAKE LONG.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.033
PLUS IT'LL BE LIKE A DRY RUN

13:20.067 --> 13:21.334
FOR THE DAY
WHEN YOU TWO HAVE KIDS.

13:21.368 --> 13:22.169
- THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.
- WHY NOT?

13:22.202 --> 13:23.871
- I--

13:23.904 --> 13:25.272
UM...BECAUSE I HAD A DAD

13:25.305 --> 13:26.639
WHO NEVER WANTED
TO SPEND ANY TIME WITH ME,

13:26.673 --> 13:27.374
WHO NOW HAS ANOTHER KID
HE DOESN'T WANNA

13:27.407 --> 13:29.176
SPEND ANY TIME WITH.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.777
- HE'S NOT A KID.
HE'S YOUR BROTHER.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.512
YOU ALWAYS BITCHED
ABOUT NOT HAVING A BROTHER.

13:32.545 --> 13:33.546
- I WANTED ONE WHO WAS, LIKE,
THREE YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.482
NOT THREE GODDAMN DECADES.

13:35.515 --> 13:36.349
- HOW OLD ARE YOU, SWEETHEART?

13:36.383 --> 13:37.951
- I'M 27.
- WOW.

13:37.985 --> 13:38.952
YOU DON'T START
HAVING KIDS SOON,

13:38.986 --> 13:40.387
YOUR EGGS ARE GONNA DRY UP.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.322
- HEY.
- IT'S LIKE HE'S FROM THE 1950s.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.524
- I KNOW.
- 1948, TO BE EXACT.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.293
ALL THESE BROADS NOWADAYS,

13:46.326 --> 13:48.495
HAVING KIDS IN THEIR
LATE 30s AND 40s,

13:48.528 --> 13:50.197
AND THEN THEY
WANNA HAVE A CAREER TOO?

13:50.230 --> 13:53.200
THIS JUST IN--
YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.168
- WELL, THIS JUST IN: I'M ABOUT
TO KICK YOUR DAD IN THE NUTS.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.669
- GO AHEAD, DARLING.
HAVE AT IT.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.906
'CAUSE I DON'T
HAVE ANY NUTS LEFT.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.308
I'M A 65-YEAR-OLD
RETIRED FIREFIGHTER

14:01.341 --> 14:03.743
WITH A 37-YEAR-OLD WIFE
WITH A FULL-TIME JOB

14:03.776 --> 14:06.413
WHO LEAVES ME AT HOME
WITH A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD KID.

14:06.446 --> 14:07.981
LOOK AT ALL THE SH--
I'M CARRYING.

14:08.015 --> 14:10.250
HELMETS, ELBOW PADS,
KNEE PADS...

14:10.283 --> 14:11.351
- I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT THIS
WAS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.686
- SCENTED GODDAMN SKIN WIPES.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.056
I'M LIKE A GAY FREAKIN'
SHERPA GUIDE.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.091
WHEN THE HELL DID KIDS
BECOME SUCH PUSSIES?

14:18.125 --> 14:19.559
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP
IN BOSTON...

14:19.592 --> 14:21.328
- DAD.
- WE DIDN'T HAVE VIDEO GAMES.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.429
WE PLAYED OUTSIDE.
- DAD.

14:22.462 --> 14:23.863
- ALL DAY.
- DAD.

14:23.897 --> 14:24.664
- HE'S TRYING
TO GET YOUR ATTENTION.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.598
- DAD!
- WHAT?

14:25.632 --> 14:27.167
- I JUST SCORED A TOUCHDOWN.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.069
- THAT'S NICE, SON.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.604
HE NEVER TOUCHED
A REAL FOOTBALL IN HIS LIFE.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.106
HIS MOTHER SAYS
IT'S TOO VIOLENT.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.707
SO HE PLAYS SOCCER WITH GIRLS

14:34.741 --> 14:36.709
IN A LEAGUE
WHERE THEY DON'T KEEP SCORE.

14:36.743 --> 14:39.612
AT THIS POINT, I'M JUST HAPPY
THE KID AIN'T WEARING A DRESS.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.414
- DAD, DAD, DAD, EXTRA POINT!

14:41.448 --> 14:43.116
- GOOD BOY, JACK.

14:43.150 --> 14:45.285
YOU'RE A COP, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.853
- PERFECT,
I'LL JUST STEAL YOUR PURSE,

14:46.886 --> 14:48.121
RUN LIKE A BAT OUT OF HELL,
YOU SHOOT ME IN THE LEG.

14:48.155 --> 14:49.389
THAT WAY
I CAN SLEEP FOR, LIKE,

14:49.422 --> 14:51.124
A WEEK AND A HALF
IN THE HOSPITAL.

14:51.158 --> 14:54.294
- DAD, DAD, DAD, DAD,
DAD, DAD, DAD, DAD!

14:54.327 --> 14:56.129
- I'M SERIOUS.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.269
- YEAH, HE'S GOT
A LOT OF ENERGY.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.570
- YOU WERE THE EXACT SAME WAY.

15:03.603 --> 15:06.106
WORSE EVEN.
- REALLY?

15:06.139 --> 15:07.907
I MUST HAVE
BEEN A GIANT PAIN IN THE ASS.

15:07.941 --> 15:10.243
- I WOULDN'T KNOW,
I WAS ALWAYS AT WORK.

15:10.277 --> 15:11.911
BUT YOU PUT SOME MILEAGE
ON YOUR MOM THOUGH.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.880
GOD LOVE HER.
SHE WAS ALWAYS AT HOME.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.882
BEING A MOM IS A FULL-TIME JOB.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.151
- WELL, I'M NOT GONNA STOP BEING
A COP WHEN I HAVE CHILDREN.

15:18.185 --> 15:19.286
I'M GONNA DO BOTH.

15:19.319 --> 15:20.954
AND NO VIDEO GAMES FOR MY KIDS.

15:20.988 --> 15:22.555
BOOKS.

15:22.589 --> 15:23.923
THEY'RE GONNA LEARN
TO READ ACTUAL BOOKS.

15:23.957 --> 15:25.258
- YOU MIGHT WANNA GO
THE ADOPTION ROUTE THEN.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.493
PICK OUT A REAL SMART ONE.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.061
ASIANS, AFRICANS.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.063
PLUS THE ASIANS
ARE UNBELIEVABLY NEAT.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.764
A BUDDY OF MINE'S GOT ONE.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.600
YOU COULD EAT OFF THE FLOOR
IN THAT KID'S ROOM.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.002
AND THE AFRICAN KIDS,

15:35.035 --> 15:36.636
WELL, BETWEEN THE MARATHONS
AND THE MUSIC,

15:36.669 --> 15:38.005
YOU'RE MAKING MONEY
OFF 'EM EITHER WAY.

15:38.038 --> 15:40.607
- DAD, DAD, DAD, WATCH THIS!

15:40.640 --> 15:42.009
- OH, YOU GUYS STAY HERE.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.576
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
- WHERE YOU GOING?

15:43.610 --> 15:44.744
- TO THE DRUG STORE
TO GET SOME BENADRYL.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.179
KNOCKS HIM RIGHT OUT.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.680
ONLY THING THAT WORKS
WHEN HE GETS LIKE THIS.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.749
- OKAY, WE ARE NOT GIVING
THAT BOY BENADRYL.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.251
- WHY, YOU GOT
SOMETHING STRONGER?

15:51.284 --> 15:52.619
- OKAY, RELAX.
- [scoffs]

15:52.652 --> 15:54.654
- I REMEMBER THIS NOW.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.923
I KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE
THE ONLY CHILD AND A BOY.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.192
I KNOW WHAT HE NEEDS.
JACK, GIMME FIVE.

15:59.226 --> 16:00.693
UP HIGH.

16:00.727 --> 16:01.995
DOWN LOW.
TOO SLOW.

16:02.029 --> 16:05.065
COME HERE, LET'S GO.
- [laughs]

16:08.568 --> 16:10.203
- DOES HE TALK?

16:10.237 --> 16:11.871
- HE'S JUST ENJOYING DINNER,
MAMA.

16:11.904 --> 16:13.506
- WELL, HE JUST ENJOYED
A WHOLE BOWL

16:13.540 --> 16:15.308
FULL OF MY POTATO AU GRATIN.

16:15.342 --> 16:17.944
- NO, I DIDN'T.
- EXCUSE ME?

16:17.977 --> 16:20.213
- IT'S NOT AU GRATIN IF IT
DOESN'T HAVE CHEESE ON IT.

16:20.247 --> 16:22.282
- ARE YOU CRITIQUING MY FOOD?

16:22.315 --> 16:23.983
- MAMA.
- NO, I'M ENJOYING YOUR FOOD,

16:24.017 --> 16:25.852
I'M JUST CRITIQUING
YOUR TERMINOLOGY.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.454
- DON'T DO THAT.
- REALLY?

16:27.487 --> 16:29.189
- LOOK, YOU CAN COOK.
THAT'S OBVIOUS.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.957
I'M JUST TRYING TO SAVE YOU

16:30.990 --> 16:33.726
THE EMBARRASSMENT OF CALLING
YOUR DISHES BY THE WRONG NAME.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.363
- IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I
SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED ABOUT?

16:36.396 --> 16:38.031
- WELL, SINCE YOU ASKED,

16:38.065 --> 16:40.200
THAT PORTRAIT OF JESUS ON
THE WALL.

16:40.233 --> 16:43.036
[laughs]

16:43.070 --> 16:46.373
- I KNOW YOU ARE NOT ABOUT TO
CRITICIZE MY LORD AND SAVIOR.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.241
- I WOULDN'T DREAM OF IT.
PASS THE ROLLS.

16:48.275 --> 16:49.676
BUT MAKING HIM BLACK?

16:49.709 --> 16:51.478
THAT'S A BRIDGE TOO FAR.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.879
- WELL, HE WASN'T WHITE.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.714
- HE DIDN'T
LOOK LIKE WILL SMITH.

16:54.747 --> 16:56.083
- BETHLEHEM WAS IN--

16:56.116 --> 16:57.717
- IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
I GET IT.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.386
BUT REALISTICALLY,

16:59.419 --> 17:01.521
JESUS LOOKED
MORE LIKE OSAMA BIN LADEN

17:01.554 --> 17:03.223
THAN THE FRESH GODDAMN
PRINCE OF BEL AIR.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.491
- OKAY.
- MISTER, YOU LOOKING

17:04.524 --> 17:06.059
FOR TROUBLE?

17:06.093 --> 17:07.160
WELL, TROUBLE
IS ABOUT TO ARRIVE.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.895
- OH, SH--

17:08.928 --> 17:10.263
- I'M JUST TRYING TO TELL YOU
ABOUT HISTORY AND ART.

17:10.297 --> 17:11.431
- OH, SH--
- I MEAN, WHO PAINTED THAT CRAP?

17:11.464 --> 17:12.399
- I PAINTED IT!
- WELL, SHE--

17:12.432 --> 17:14.000
AND I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW

17:14.033 --> 17:15.868
THAT MY SERIES OF BLACK JESUS
PORTRAITS SOLD OUT

17:15.902 --> 17:16.736
AT THE DECATUR ART FESTIVAL.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.671
- OH, GET OUT OF HERE.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.840
THEY SELL THEM THINGS
DOWN THERE BY THE LIQUOR STORE.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.375
- AW, MAN.
- HANK.

17:22.409 --> 17:23.676
- YOU KNOW, I THINK
THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME

17:23.710 --> 17:25.612
TO SAY A PRAYER--
UH--UH, SOMETHING.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.013
- NO, IT MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME
FOR ME TO CHOKE HIS ASS OUT.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.681
- MAMA--MAMA,
DON'T CHOKE HIM OUT.

17:28.715 --> 17:29.949
- YOU LET HIM SAY SOMETHING ELSE
TO ME ABOUT MY JESUS.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.451
- THESE GREENS
COULD USE A PRAYER.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.353
I'M GONNA TELL YOU.
- OH.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.621
I'M GONNA TELL--JUST A LITTLE
ON THE TOUGH SIDE.

17:34.654 --> 17:35.455
- MAMA, YOU KNOW--
- I'M JUST SAYIN'.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.393
- HE'S OUT.

17:40.427 --> 17:41.628
- YOUR JACK
HAS A GOOD LITTLE ARM.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.029
- I NEVER KNEW.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.631
HIS MOM WON'T
LET HIM PLAY CATCH.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.933
SHE'S AFRAID THE BALL
WOULD HIT HIM IN THE FACE.

17:46.966 --> 17:48.435
JESUS, HE REALLY
LOVED THAT PIZZA.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.237
- YEAH.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.205
I'M LIKING THE WAY THAT
PLAYING WITH YOUR JACK

17:52.239 --> 17:53.940
IS LOOKING ON MY JOHNNY.

17:53.973 --> 17:55.275
- AH, YOU WANNA HAVE KIDS,
RIGHT?

17:55.308 --> 17:57.544
SURE YOU DO, YOU'RE A BROAD.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.146
SORRY.
CHICK.

17:59.179 --> 18:01.548
- HI.
- [laughs]

18:01.581 --> 18:03.316
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.
LET'S GET BACK GOING.

18:03.350 --> 18:05.051
- JUST COOKING 101.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.419
IF YOU'RE GONNA FRY
YOUR OWN FISH,

18:06.453 --> 18:08.288
YOU GOTTA MAKE SURE
THE OIL'S HOT.

18:08.321 --> 18:10.390
- MY OIL IS HOT.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.492
- IF YOUR FISH IS BREAKING UP IN
THE PAN, THAT OIL AIN'T HOT.

18:12.525 --> 18:15.228
- MY OIL IS DAMN HOT.
HOT AS HELL.

18:15.262 --> 18:16.563
- OKAY, MAMA,
THAT WAS GREAT.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.431
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
BUT WE--WE GOTTA GO.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.433
COME ON, CASH.
- I HAVE NEVER, EVER

18:20.467 --> 18:23.503
IN MY LIFE BEEN SPOKEN TO
IN THIS MANNER IN MY OWN HOUSE.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.405
JESUS IS MY LORD AND SAVIOR

18:25.438 --> 18:27.774
AND MY JESUS CAN LOOK ANY
GODDAMN WAY I WANT HIM TO.

18:27.807 --> 18:30.810
- OKAY, YOUR HOUSE,
YOUR JESUS, I SUPPOSE.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.813
BUT ONE THING I DO KNOW--
AND KNOW DAMN WELL--IS FISH.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.583
HOW TO CATCH 'EM,
HOW TO COOK 'EM.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.619
SH--, I ALMOST CAUGHT ME A
MEKONG KING CATFISH IN VIETNAM.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.254
- OKAY.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.589
- LARGEST FRESHWATER FISH
ON THE PLANET.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.656
- WELL, I DON'T
GIVE A DAMN ABOUT NO

18:43.690 --> 18:45.858
VIETCONG CATFISH-ASS BULLSH--

18:45.892 --> 18:47.360

18:47.394 --> 18:49.862
LET'S--LET'S LET MAMA REST.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.264
- NO, YOU GO AHEAD, MAN.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.300
I'M--I'M GONNA STAY A WHILE.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.634
- WHAT?

18:54.667 --> 18:55.835
- YOU HEARD ME.
GO ON, MAN.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.304
YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.338
I'LL BE FINE.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.139
- HE'S GONNA BE REAL FINE.

19:00.173 --> 19:01.874
- WERE WE SITTING
AT THE SAME TABLE?

19:01.908 --> 19:03.643
- YOU WERE.
NOW YOU AIN'T.

19:03.676 --> 19:07.680
- BYE, BABY.

19:07.714 --> 19:10.683
GO ON, LOCK THE DOOR,
PULL THE SHADES.

19:10.717 --> 19:11.951
- NICE BOY.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.620
- MM, WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME ICE CREAM?

19:13.653 --> 19:14.654
- YOU GOT SOME
COOL WHIP WITH THAT?

19:14.687 --> 19:17.457
[knocks on door]

19:17.490 --> 19:18.891
- HI.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.293
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19:20.327 --> 19:21.561
- I'M SORRY, IS THIS WEIRD?

19:21.594 --> 19:22.695
- YEAH.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.564
- GOOD.

19:24.597 --> 19:28.835
'CAUSE I'M ABOUT TO
MAKE IT EVEN WEIRDER.

19:28.868 --> 19:31.704
YOU DON'T WANNA HAVE SEX,
AND THAT'S FINE WITH ME.

19:31.738 --> 19:34.173
'CAUSE I'M NOT HAVING SEX
RIGHT NOW EITHER.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.008
YOU DON'T LIKE SEX,
I HAPPEN TO LOVE IT.

19:36.042 --> 19:40.046
FROM WHAT I REMEMBER, IT WAS
PRETTY AWESOME...FOR ME.

19:40.079 --> 19:42.315
I CAN'T REALLY SPEAK FOR
EVERYONE ELSE INVOLVED.

19:42.349 --> 19:45.252
SO FORGET SEX.

19:45.285 --> 19:46.653
I LIKE YOU.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.888
I THINK YOU'RE FUNNY
AND DIFFERENT

19:48.921 --> 19:50.423
AND I NEVER KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY.

19:50.457 --> 19:52.058
AND OBVIOUSLY
I THINK YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

19:52.091 --> 19:55.728
BUT IF WE NEVER HAVE SEX,
THAT'S OKAY.

19:55.762 --> 19:59.499
'CAUSE I'M JUST HAPPY
BEING AROUND YOU.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.701
SO...

20:01.734 --> 20:04.671
HERE.

20:04.704 --> 20:05.705
- A BIRDHOUSE.

20:05.738 --> 20:08.775
- LOOK INSIDE.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.880
- OH, MY GOD.

20:13.913 --> 20:16.115
IS IT REAL?

20:16.148 --> 20:18.885
- IT BELONGED TO THE MAN
WHO BUILT THE BIRDHOUSE.

20:18.918 --> 20:21.788
AND NOW IT BELONGS TO YOU.

20:21.821 --> 20:25.258
- HOLY SH--

20:26.826 --> 20:28.027
THIS USED TO BE ON A PERSON?

20:28.060 --> 20:29.562
- YEAH.

20:29.596 --> 20:33.065
- BRIAN...

20:33.099 --> 20:34.801
THIS IS ONE OF THE ABSOLUTE
NICEST THINGS

20:34.834 --> 20:37.537
ANYONE'S EVER DONE FOR ME.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.205
- IF YOU STARE AT IT LONG ENOUGH

20:39.238 --> 20:41.007
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEGINNING
TO TWITCH.

20:45.845 --> 20:46.946
- OH, WAS THAT TOO MUCH?

20:46.979 --> 20:48.415
- MM-HMM.
A LITTLE BIT.

20:48.448 --> 20:49.749
- A STEP TOO FAR?
- A LITTLE.

20:49.782 --> 20:50.783
JUST EASE ME INTO IT.

20:50.817 --> 20:52.285
- YEAH, WE CAN TAKE IT SLOW.

20:52.319 --> 20:54.621
- LOOK AT THAT
DREAMY LITTLE FACE.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.458
- GUESS ALL THAT PLAYING CATCH

20:58.491 --> 20:59.759
REALLY WORE HIM OUT.
- MM-HMM.

20:59.792 --> 21:03.463
- AND TAG.
AND HIDE AND SEEK.

21:05.665 --> 21:06.799
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
ABOUT HIM?

21:06.833 --> 21:08.935
- MM.

21:08.968 --> 21:10.337
ALL THAT BENADRYL YOU GAVE HIM,

21:10.370 --> 21:11.504
HE'S GONNA BE ASLEEP ALL NIGHT.

21:11.538 --> 21:12.839
- HE WAS GETTING
VERY, VERY CRANKY.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.874
- HE WAS.

21:18.545 --> 21:19.512
- THERE.
- [gasps]

21:19.546 --> 21:20.513
- IT MOVED.
- NO!

21:20.547 --> 21:21.848
- YEAH.
- DID IT?

21:21.881 --> 21:23.983
- LOOK AGAIN.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.685
[keys jingle]
- HELLO?

21:25.718 --> 21:27.654
- HEY, MAN.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.356
YOUR MOM'S JUST CHECKING TO MAKE
SURE YOU GOT HOME SAFE.

21:29.389 --> 21:30.423
- YEP, JUST PULLED IN.

21:30.457 --> 21:31.824
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.

21:31.858 --> 21:33.793
SHE'LL BE GLAD TO HEAR IT.

21:33.826 --> 21:34.827
GOOD NIGHT...

21:34.861 --> 21:36.663
- MM-HMM.
- SON.
