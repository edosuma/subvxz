- That was 30 years ago.

09:54.703 --> 09:58.256
I know, but... (SIGHS)
I'm bummed for you

09:58.281 --> 10:02.051
that you didn't have
this iconic school experience.

10:02.076 --> 10:05.878
Trust me, not getting to dance
to Frankie Avalon as a kid

10:06.187 --> 10:07.748
was the least of my problems.

10:10.849 --> 10:13.115
I think there are plenty
of chaperones here, don't you?

10:16.756 --> 10:17.764
Come on.

10:17.789 --> 10:19.904
I thought you wanted to see
the kids' first moments.

10:19.929 --> 10:22.170
Yeah, I-I do, but we have
four hours for that.

10:22.335 --> 10:23.787
We're-we're here for four hours?

10:23.812 --> 10:25.256
- Yeah.
- Rebecca.

10:26.619 --> 10:28.490
- (AIR PUMPING STEADILY)
- You are one handsome boy.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.584
Sweet...

10:31.261 --> 10:32.568
little handsome boy.

10:33.164 --> 10:35.522
- GREEN: Hey, guys.
- Hi.

10:35.547 --> 10:37.577
So it's time to take
some blood and urine samples.

10:37.602 --> 10:39.022
Still totally routine.

10:39.047 --> 10:40.380
We just have to continue to monitor

10:40.405 --> 10:41.772
all his levels, okay?

10:44.414 --> 10:47.623
If you want, you can talk
to Jack or sing to him.

10:47.734 --> 10:50.326
- It can be comforting.
- Okay.

10:51.747 --> 10:53.272
Toby, what should we sing?

11:00.177 --> 11:02.006

He can't cry.

11:14.992 --> 11:17.380
He's got that tube
crammed down his throat.

11:17.880 --> 11:19.787
Okay. Blood sample's all done.

11:20.081 --> 11:21.873
Now we're going to insert the catheter

11:21.898 --> 11:24.123
into his urethra
to take the urine sample.

11:32.587 --> 11:34.006

11:34.031 --> 11:35.889
or slide a little tiny bedpan under him

11:35.914 --> 11:36.928
and just wait until he pees

11:36.953 --> 11:38.412

How was your AA meeting?
You find the one you like?

12:04.265 --> 12:05.904
Yeah. I tried one in the East Village.

12:05.929 --> 12:07.717
Uh, the people were pretty cool,

12:07.897 --> 12:09.334
but the place kind of smelled
like asparagus.

12:09.359 --> 12:11.147
I think there's
a vegan restaurant next door.

12:12.129 --> 12:14.436
Listen, I need to talk to you about...

12:15.524 --> 12:17.420
something you said at therapy.

12:17.715 --> 12:18.873
Okay.

12:19.544 --> 12:21.178
When you mentioned kids.

12:22.383 --> 12:24.037
Is that something you really want?

12:24.772 --> 12:25.967
Why? Are you pregnant?

12:27.552 --> 12:28.811
- (SCOFFS SOFTLY)
- That was a bad joke.

12:29.997 --> 12:31.217
Wait. Are you pregnant?

12:31.874 --> 12:33.084
Kevin, I...

12:35.032 --> 12:36.568
I want to be direct with you.

12:37.809 --> 12:39.014
I love you.

12:39.777 --> 12:40.873
(EXHALES)

12:41.154 --> 12:42.631
But I don't want to have kids.

12:44.523 --> 12:46.615
Kids have never been part of my plan and

12:47.197 --> 12:48.373
they will never be.

12:56.799 --> 12:57.865
(KEVIN SIGHS)

12:58.712 --> 13:00.061
Is this because of your dad?

13:01.678 --> 13:04.341
Um, I think it's more than that.

13:04.453 --> 13:09.084
I... I like my life...
I like my life the way it is.

13:09.109 --> 13:10.209
I-I...

13:10.635 --> 13:13.256
I like that I have the freedom
to just pick up and travel.

13:13.827 --> 13:16.459
I like not basing my life
around soccer practice

13:16.484 --> 13:17.850
and math homework.

13:17.875 --> 13:19.459
- Mm-hmm.
- I like that if we wanted,

13:19.484 --> 13:21.272
we could have sex
on the counter right now

13:21.297 --> 13:23.904
with no fear of a kid walking in
and being scarred for life.

13:24.113 --> 13:25.240
- Well, I have the time.
- (CHUCKLES)

13:25.265 --> 13:27.709
We are not having sex
on the counter right now.

13:30.803 --> 13:32.076
Right. Well, um...

13:32.593 --> 13:35.262
It's just, well...
You never mentioned this before.

13:36.502 --> 13:38.795
Oh, I guess I thought
we were on the same page.

13:39.901 --> 13:41.670
When your sister
was trying to get pregnant,

13:41.695 --> 13:43.943
you said that... that having a kid

13:43.968 --> 13:45.553
was the last thing you could imagine.

13:45.578 --> 13:48.318
I know, but I just
kind of thought eventually,

13:49.351 --> 13:50.592
you know, s...

13:51.070 --> 13:52.842
It just seems like something people do.

13:55.467 --> 13:56.600
But...

13:57.825 --> 13:59.779
I guess I, I guess I don't
have to have one.

14:00.497 --> 14:02.084
I mean, not necessarily.

14:03.393 --> 14:04.740
(STAMMERS QUIETLY)

14:08.070 --> 14:09.271
- Kevin.
- Hmm?

14:10.397 --> 14:12.420
I have given this a lot of thought.

14:12.788 --> 14:14.053
And you should, too.

14:15.557 --> 14:18.037
If you... if you decide

14:18.062 --> 14:20.163
you really, truly
don't want to have kids,

14:20.188 --> 14:22.451
then I am all in with you.

14:23.164 --> 14:25.100
I will stick it out
through the counseling

14:25.125 --> 14:27.426
and your recovery, whatever it takes.

14:29.203 --> 14:31.326
But if having kids is something you need

14:31.351 --> 14:32.975
to make your life complete...

14:35.121 --> 14:36.428
you have to tell me.

14:37.953 --> 14:40.037
'Cause I don't want to waste
either of our time.

14:46.405 --> 14:49.545
Thank you all so much for coming
to our spring showcase.

14:49.782 --> 14:51.717
And I want to say a special thank you

14:51.742 --> 14:53.904
to our newest instructor, Beth Pearson.

14:53.929 --> 14:57.264
Beth just started with us,
but really went above and beyond

14:57.289 --> 14:58.889
to get her dancers ready for tonight.

14:58.914 --> 15:01.490
I am so proud of all of our dancers,

15:01.515 --> 15:04.068
and the incredibly hard work
they've put in

15:04.093 --> 15:05.193
to tonight's performance.

15:05.218 --> 15:07.881
You are in for an exciting evening.

15:08.128 --> 15:10.779
I'm thrilled to present
tonight's performance to you.

15:10.804 --> 15:13.318
Now, if you'll all silence your phones,

15:13.469 --> 15:15.061
we'll get started in a few moments.

15:15.086 --> 15:16.240
(APPLAUSE)

15:18.524 --> 15:21.318
Damn, you really went for it
with these flowers.

15:22.115 --> 15:23.732
- (CHUCKLES)
- Thank you, baby. I love 'em.

15:24.122 --> 15:25.523
- You know what I love?
- Hmm?

15:25.843 --> 15:26.889
My wife.

15:27.372 --> 15:30.350
And that badass dance
she choreographed tonight.

15:30.375 --> 15:32.493
Ah, come on. I just helped
it across the finish line.

15:32.518 --> 15:34.076
Don't be modest. Hey, that one part

15:34.101 --> 15:35.147
where the dancer kept doing

15:35.172 --> 15:37.606
those twirly things
that went on and on and on?

15:37.811 --> 15:39.217
She looked like a human dreidel.

15:39.242 --> 15:40.881
- What do you call those things?
- Pirouette.

15:41.260 --> 15:43.761
She did seven pirouettes
off of one plié.

15:43.786 --> 15:45.295
Last week, she could
have only done five.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.975
Well, that was before
Beth Pearson showed up

15:47.000 --> 15:48.901
on the scene like some kind
of ballet fixer.

15:49.225 --> 15:51.693
Like Harvey Keitel in <i>Pulp Fiction,</i>

15:51.825 --> 15:53.170
- but with ballet.
- (BOTH LAUGH)

15:55.019 --> 15:57.889
You know, my boss gave me
a really nice shout-out

15:57.914 --> 15:59.681
in her speech at the beginning.
(CLICKS TONGUE)

15:59.851 --> 16:01.295
I wish you could have
been there to hear it.

16:02.912 --> 16:04.170
Well, I'm really sorry.

16:05.328 --> 16:08.365
I tried my hardest to be there
at 7:30 sharp.

16:08.989 --> 16:10.389
Tell me what she said about you.

16:10.695 --> 16:12.829
Her exact words.

16:13.822 --> 16:16.436
She said I went above and beyond.

16:18.039 --> 16:19.514
That's what I'm talking about.

16:23.771 --> 16:26.357
Mm. All right. I'm gonna take a shower.

16:26.893 --> 16:29.334
Come back down and get
the girls' lunches ready.

16:29.359 --> 16:31.498
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, you have dishes tonight.

16:33.072 --> 16:34.537
Yeah. I got it.

16:34.954 --> 16:36.818
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, Beth. Uh, sorry.

16:38.430 --> 16:40.443
Marcus Duncan, city council president,

16:40.468 --> 16:42.569
invited us to dinner
at his house tomorrow night

16:42.594 --> 16:44.029
with the other incoming councilmen.

16:44.054 --> 16:46.412
Oh. I can't. I have a class till 5.

16:46.437 --> 16:47.709
Yeah, but dinner's not till 8:00.

16:48.138 --> 16:49.545
Look, I know it'll be tight,

16:49.570 --> 16:51.240
but I really think you could make it.

16:52.524 --> 16:54.397
I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't important, Beth.

16:54.556 --> 16:56.897
Duncan assigns the new
councilmen to their committees.

16:56.922 --> 16:58.889
It's important that I make
a good impression on him.

16:59.346 --> 17:01.795
And I... You tend to be
the most impressive part

17:01.820 --> 17:03.553
of the impressions that I make.

17:05.144 --> 17:06.724
But if it's too much, I understand.

17:06.750 --> 17:08.417
No. No. I'll be there.

17:08.443 --> 17:09.568
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:10.589 --> 17:11.615
Thank you.

17:19.457 --> 17:20.740
You know what you really missed out on

17:20.765 --> 17:23.099
- by not going to school dances?
- What's that?

17:23.694 --> 17:24.763
Where you sneak away

17:24.789 --> 17:27.193
and find a hidden place
to make out with your date.

17:27.218 --> 17:28.201
Oh.

17:29.954 --> 17:31.451
RANDALL: What are you guys doing?

17:31.948 --> 17:33.982
- Randall?
- Randall.

17:35.081 --> 17:37.318
What... (SIGHS) What are you doing here?

17:37.343 --> 17:39.178
I came in here to study
for my science test.

17:39.203 --> 17:41.607
Hey, you know, Kate's friend,
she invited you here.

17:41.990 --> 17:43.154
(EXHALES)

17:44.137 --> 17:46.686
Dad, my science average is 97.6,

17:46.711 --> 17:49.725
and Willy Hogan's
science average is 97.8.

17:50.180 --> 17:52.873
Which is why I need to read
about mitochondria right now.

17:52.898 --> 17:56.131
No. Randall, you made
a commitment to Jessica.

17:56.208 --> 17:59.177
So, you can study this weekend
until your brain overheats,

17:59.426 --> 18:01.553
but right now, you're gonna
go back in that gym,

18:01.578 --> 18:03.546
and you're gonna ask that girl
if she wants to dance.

18:03.571 --> 18:05.084
- Yeah, come on. Let's go.
- I...

18:06.210 --> 18:07.350
Let's go.

18:08.930 --> 18:11.834
Okay. But if I don't get into
an Ivy League college,

18:11.859 --> 18:13.217
- it's on you guys.
- Fine.

18:13.423 --> 18:14.545
Let's go.

18:17.114 --> 18:18.467
Hey, babe. What's up?

18:18.492 --> 18:20.436
<i>BETH: Babe, I need to talk
to you about tonight.</i>

18:20.461 --> 18:21.920
I know timing sucks,

18:21.945 --> 18:24.826
but something exciting happened
for me at work,

18:24.851 --> 18:27.352
<i>and I'm not sure I'm gonna
be able to make the dinner.</i>

18:27.377 --> 18:28.544
- What happened?
- My boss

18:28.569 --> 18:29.897
<i>invited me out for drinks tonight</i>

18:29.922 --> 18:31.272
<i>with some of the other instructors</i>

18:31.297 --> 18:32.904
to talk about the future of the studio.

18:32.929 --> 18:36.584
And it's a big deal to be
included, since I'm brand-new.

18:36.835 --> 18:38.302
Well, can't it wait until tomorrow?

18:38.327 --> 18:39.756
<i>No, 'cause it's happening tonight.</i>

18:39.781 --> 18:42.115
I already told Duncan we were
both gonna be there for dinner.

18:42.337 --> 18:43.389
Yeah.

18:44.226 --> 18:45.584
- See you later, Beth.
- Okay.

18:46.404 --> 18:47.904
Yeah, I thought I could,

18:47.929 --> 18:49.463
<i>- but now a work thing came up.
- (PHONE RINGING)</i>

18:49.488 --> 18:50.967
- You got to take this.
- Just one second.

You know my work is just as
legitimate as yours is, Randall.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.803
what my days have been like lately,

19:00.828 --> 19:02.670
but I have been burning the candle

19:02.695 --> 19:06.209

19:07.960 --> 19:10.762
which, for the record,
has been my pleasure.

19:11.056 --> 19:15.475
But now, I need you
to do this one thing. Okay?

19:16.392 --> 19:18.381
I need you to be there for me tonight.

19:20.092 --> 19:21.201
