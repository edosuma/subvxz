Quinn's hairpin.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.000
They found it
on her body.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.790
I traced it
to the Smithsonian.

12:06.790 --> 12:08.330
Some dead First Lady
used to own it.

12:08.330 --> 12:10.120
I asked Liv if
she'd ever seen it.
She said no.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.080
So?

12:13.170 --> 12:15.120
Look who signed it out.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.880
I think
Liv did a bad thing.

12:16.880 --> 12:18.830
Because she forgot
about a hairpin?

12:18.830 --> 12:20.920
It's not just
the hairpin.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.040
Look.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.250
This is
Liv's cellphone activity

12:27.250 --> 12:28.500
the night
before Quinn's wedding.

12:28.500 --> 12:29.620
You hacked
into her cellphone?

12:29.620 --> 12:31.120
At 10:03 p.m.,

12:31.120 --> 12:33.080
her cellphone pinged off
the 14th Street cell tower.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.330
Guess what's
down the road

12:34.330 --> 12:36.120
from the 14th Street
cell tower.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.170
The D.C. War Memorial.

12:38.170 --> 12:39.620
Huck --
What if it was Liv

12:39.620 --> 12:40.960
that Quinn met with
that night?
That's crazy.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.750
Is it?
Think back, Abby.

12:42.750 --> 12:44.120
When Quinn went missing,

12:44.120 --> 12:45.790
Liv took charge
of the search.

12:45.790 --> 12:46.830
She was concerned.

12:46.830 --> 12:48.210
Or she wanted to manage us,

12:48.210 --> 12:49.380
keep us away
from the truth.

12:49.380 --> 12:50.540
That doesn't even --

12:50.540 --> 12:51.790
Why would Liv do that?

12:51.790 --> 12:53.080
Because she killed Rashad!

12:53.080 --> 12:54.620
She must have!

12:54.620 --> 12:55.670
And when
Quinn found out about it,

12:55.670 --> 12:56.960
Liv killed her!

12:56.960 --> 12:58.080
No.
She killed her, Abby.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.460

29:05.540 --> 29:07.120
But there is no perspective.

29:07.120 --> 29:09.210
It doesn't make sense.

29:14.380 --> 29:18.540
There's no silver lining,
no hope.

29:20.880 --> 29:22.500
No good comes from this.

That's all
I can think of to say.

29:43.750 --> 29:45.670
It's just awful.

29:49.790 --> 29:50.920
I'm sorry. I --

29:50.920 --> 29:53.540
No.

29:53.540 --> 29:54.880
Well said.

30:03.460 --> 30:05.620
You know,
this is probably illegal.

30:16.670 --> 30:17.920
So long, Robin.

30:17.920 --> 30:20.330
I love you.

Relax.

Well,
I don't need your help.

30:38.710 --> 30:40.620
Huck:

30:44.040 --> 30:46.000
What?

30:46.000 --> 30:47.380
You're weird.

30:47.380 --> 30:48.790
I'm not weird.

30:48.790 --> 30:49.960
Weird is good.

31:03.380 --> 31:04.500
It's the best job

31:04.500 --> 31:06.330

you will slay dragons,

31:06.330 --> 31:07.500
you will love the hunt
more than you ever dreamed.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.170
And I am not crazy.

31:09.170 --> 31:10.420
I'm a gladiator in a suit.

31:10.420 --> 31:11.580
That's what you are
when you work at O.P.A.

31:11.580 --> 31:12.750
You're a gladiator
in a suit.

31:12.750 --> 31:15.080
Do you want to be
a gladiator in a suit?

31:32.040 --> 31:34.920
Quinn:
You want to have a baby?
Let's have a baby.

31:34.920 --> 31:36.670
Over a cliff.

31:36.670 --> 31:39.500
Over a cliff.

31:54.540 --> 31:57.170
We are the white hats.
We are the good guys.

31:57.170 --> 31:58.920
We don't quit.
We get justice.

31:58.920 --> 32:03.460
No. Huck's right.

32:03.460 --> 32:05.210
There is no justice
on this one.

32:05.210 --> 32:08.580
The good guys lose,
and white hats burn.

32:08.580 --> 32:11.000

Jake: Olivia's okay.

33:09.460 --> 33:11.080

39:23.000 --> 39:24.420
Right.

39:24.420 --> 39:27.170
Everybody was sending us stuff
for the baby.

39:27.170 --> 39:29.120
Somebody sent us
this playpen.

39:29.120 --> 39:30.790
The thing was huge.

39:30.790 --> 39:32.170
It took Quinn three hours

39:55.000 --> 39:56.460
Ohh!
Ah!

39:56.460 --> 39:58.460
And we broke it.

39:58.460 --> 39:59.960
Can it be fixed?

40:03.080 --> 40:05.000
It's not
part of the playpen.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.380
I think it was hidden
inside of it.

40:07.380 --> 40:08.830

What is it?

40:19.960 --> 40:21.210
