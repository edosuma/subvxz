WEBVTT

00:03.523 --> 00:06.233
JUST THREE FRIENDS

00:07.401 --> 00:09.778
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey, Sam.

00:09.945 --> 00:14.699
I think I found the answer
to the robberies in this neighbourhood.

00:14.866 --> 00:18.035
- I'm gonna get an alarm.
- This is better.

00:18.202 --> 00:22.081
This friend of mine
has a gigantic attack dog.

00:22.248 --> 00:27.586
He's gotten so mean that he can't handle
him. That would be perfect protection.

00:27.752 --> 00:32.756
Coach, maybe so, but
where are we gonna keep a dog?

00:35.843 --> 00:37.845
I figured the office.

00:42.098 --> 00:44.142
It's vicious!

00:46.561 --> 00:49.564
- Get that dog the hell out of here.
- How?

00:49.731 --> 00:52.858
I don't know. How did you get it in here?

00:53.025 --> 00:56.028
He was in a cage when he came in
but he ate it.

00:57.362 --> 01:00.489
This is ridiculous.
How will I use my office?

01:00.656 --> 01:06.621
In my profession, I've grown accustomed
to dealing with bellicose canines.

01:06.787 --> 01:10.040
- Allow me.
- What are you gonna do, mace him?

01:10.206 --> 01:15.670
That's much too crueI. I find, dealing with
animals, it's better to be kind yet firm.

01:18.757 --> 01:23.010
- Sit!
- He is sitting, Cliff.

01:25.262 --> 01:27.306
Nuke the beast, Sam.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074

02:40.955 --> 02:42.997
Gee, Sam. I'm so sorry.

02:43.164 --> 02:47.252
Get on the phone. I want the owner
to get the dog out of here.

02:47.419 --> 02:51.005
- Hello, everyone.
- Goody, Diane is here.

02:51.172 --> 02:54.716
This is Heather Landon,
my oldest friend.

02:54.883 --> 02:57.302
Meet her this morning?

03:00.139 --> 03:05.560
That's Carla. She likes a little witty
repartee, she's just not capable of it.

03:07.145 --> 03:11.398
And Heather, I want you
to meet someone else, over here.

03:11.565 --> 03:14.860
- Coach Ernie Pantusso.
- How do you do?

03:15.026 --> 03:18.572
Hi. Call me Coach
or my other nickname.

03:18.738 --> 03:22.283
- What other nickname?
- Satchmo.

03:23.534 --> 03:27.037
Coach, you're thinking
of Louis Armstrong.

03:27.204 --> 03:30.373
No, but I like that even better.

03:32.625 --> 03:36.629
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Coffee, thank you.

03:36.796 --> 03:43.051
Now, down here are Cliff and Norman,
two of our most regular regulars.

03:43.218 --> 03:46.763
- Hi.
- Hiya. Pleased to do you.

03:48.848 --> 03:50.892
I mean, how do I meet me.

03:52.435 --> 03:56.814
- Forget it.
- Smooth, Cliff.

03:57.731 --> 03:59.816
I hate her.

03:59.983 --> 04:03.153
I love this place.
It's got a great feeling.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.405
Yeah, I knew you'd like it.

04:05.572 --> 04:08.824
Sam, I tried reaching the owner.
No answer.

04:08.991 --> 04:12.536
- Thank you, Coach.
- You can call me Louis Armstrong.

04:17.832 --> 04:22.253
That must be Sammykins. He is
gorgeous, just as you described him.

04:23.755 --> 04:25.797
- Hey.
- Hi.

04:25.964 --> 04:29.509
You didn't do justice to his cologne.

04:29.676 --> 04:33.055
And you wanted me to switch. See?

04:33.221 --> 04:38.601
Heather Landon, meet Sam
"I reek, therefore I am" Malone.

04:39.393 --> 04:44.314
How do you do? Heather, I've heard
Diane babble about you a lot.

04:44.481 --> 04:46.524
You grew up together, right?

04:46.691 --> 04:51.446
Practically. We were in grade schooI.
Heather hasn't changed a bit.

04:51.613 --> 04:54.281
Must have been some grade schooI.

04:54.448 --> 04:56.909
She moved into town.
Isn't that wonderfuI?

04:57.076 --> 05:01.455
I have to warn you. When we get
together, we get a little goofy.

05:01.622 --> 05:05.500
I should have brought a big Goofy.
I hear they're on sale.

05:05.667 --> 05:09.796
Cute and funny.
I think you got lucky this time, Diane.

05:09.962 --> 05:14.966
Just like the rest of them.
Hung up on looks, personality and style.

05:16.218 --> 05:19.930
Heather and I were best friends
in the fourth grade.

05:20.097 --> 05:22.181
We always got in trouble.

05:22.348 --> 05:27.978
Some of the things she got me to do!
Remember the prank phone calls?

05:30.147 --> 05:32.649
This is the WTRM radio contest.

05:32.816 --> 05:36.319
For a trip to Hawaii,
name three cars that start with P.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.364
Go ahead.

05:39.531 --> 05:41.573
Porsche, Plymouth and Pontiac.

05:42.533 --> 05:46.245
No, I'm sorry. Those cars start with gas.

06:00.549 --> 06:02.926
It's pathetic.

06:03.093 --> 06:05.262
I'll show you the place.

06:05.429 --> 06:09.056
Nice meeting you, Sam.
Sorry Diane got to you first.

06:09.223 --> 06:13.561
I often regret there are so many women
and only one of me.

06:15.604 --> 06:18.481
- Oh, boy.
- What's wrong, Sam?

06:18.648 --> 06:22.026
- You're kidding. You didn't see that?
- See what?

06:22.193 --> 06:27.281
- What are you talking about?
- Guys, Diane's friend came on to me.

06:27.448 --> 06:31.702
- You're crazy.
- You're with Diane. For her you're safe.

06:31.869 --> 06:35.205
Forget about that.
I'm talking about vibrations.

06:35.372 --> 06:40.376
I know women.
Diane's friend wants me.

06:40.543 --> 06:45.464
I know a thing or two. I've had
experience of this sort of thing.

06:46.631 --> 06:49.301
- You, Norm?
- Yeah.

06:50.677 --> 06:56.056
When I was dating Vera, her sister used
to prance around wearing a bikini

06:56.223 --> 06:58.267
or flimsy little shorts or something.

06:58.434 --> 07:02.980
She used to sit on my lap.
Whisper in my ear how sexy I was.

07:03.147 --> 07:08.318
So I did it. I asked her out.
She turned me down flat.

07:08.484 --> 07:10.361
Vera know this?

07:10.528 --> 07:14.656
Yeah, Coach. She was there
and she was really furious.

07:14.823 --> 07:16.867
I'm surprised she even married you.

07:17.034 --> 07:21.330
The ceremony was in progress.
Wasn't much she could do about it.

07:24.665 --> 07:29.670
I know what you are talking about,
but there's more going on here.

07:29.837 --> 07:33.256
- She seems like such a sweet kid.
- Yeah.

07:33.423 --> 07:40.305
Just as every author has had to work
among common people for materiaI.

07:41.805 --> 07:43.849
Muscles!

07:48.103 --> 07:51.064
I think Sammy's on to something here.

07:51.230 --> 07:55.151
She's a vixen,
undressing every man with her eyes.

07:55.318 --> 07:58.529
No wonder I felt such a chill.

07:58.696 --> 08:00.697
That's our little pub.

08:00.864 --> 08:07.412
Diane, she hasn't seen all of it yet.
You didn't show her Sam's office.

08:08.205 --> 08:10.247
No, Carla!

08:17.171 --> 08:20.632
Just some of that witty repartee
you love.

08:22.092 --> 08:24.678
That was a lousy thing to do.

08:28.305 --> 08:30.349
What the hell is that?

08:30.516 --> 08:35.604
It's an attack dog a friend of mine
gave me. He's good.

08:37.231 --> 08:40.357
- Excellent.
- Coach, get on the phone.

08:40.525 --> 08:45.905
- Diane, are you all right?
- Yes. You trained me well.

08:46.072 --> 08:48.115
Listen, I've really got to be going.

08:48.281 --> 08:54.663
Oh, right. You and I and Sam will have
dinner tonight. I'm going to cook.

08:54.830 --> 08:58.666
- Why?
- Well, to celebrate.

08:58.833 --> 09:03.504
Now that Heather's living here
I want us all to be good friends.

09:03.671 --> 09:08.466
And I have a speciaI recipe to try.
My own veaI Oscar.

09:08.633 --> 09:12.512
That's the award you get
if you can act like you like it.

09:14.888 --> 09:19.935
Heather, do you mind hanging on?
I want to talk to Diane in private.

09:20.102 --> 09:24.564
Sure. I know what you're gonna do.
I'll finish my coffee.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.108
OK. All right.

09:27.275 --> 09:30.820
- Sam, no answer yet.
- Just keep trying.

09:30.987 --> 09:36.032
Look, sweetheart.
Hey, hey, come on.

09:36.199 --> 09:43.205
Heather's OK, but I don't think
we should hang out too much.

09:43.372 --> 09:49.462
- Why not?
- I don't think the two of us hit it off.

09:49.628 --> 09:55.049
- You hit it off. She's nuts about you.
- I bet she is.

09:55.216 --> 09:59.179
I didn't want to have to tell you
this because you're pals.

09:59.345 --> 10:03.307
But she's coming on to me gangbusters.

10:05.684 --> 10:09.646
- Why do you look at me like that?
- I can't believe you're saying this.

10:09.813 --> 10:15.193
I need help here. I don't have
much experience saying no to women.

10:15.359 --> 10:19.155
The closest I've gotten is,
"Not now, we're landing. "

10:20.697 --> 10:24.868
I'm just telling you this because
I think you ought to keep us apart.

10:26.786 --> 10:29.538
- What?
- This is staggering.

10:29.705 --> 10:33.959
Do you think every woman you see
is attracted to you?

10:34.126 --> 10:38.756
I've had enough women come on to me
to know when it's happening.

10:38.922 --> 10:42.342
Well, I guess there's only one way
to convince you.

10:43.927 --> 10:48.014
- Heather?
- Wait a minute. What are you doing?

10:48.180 --> 10:51.350
- I'm going to ask her.
- No, don't do that.

10:51.516 --> 10:56.021
I'm sorry if it embarrasses you
but it serves you right.

10:56.188 --> 11:00.107
Heather, I'm sorry
if it makes you uncomfortable,

11:00.274 --> 11:06.656
but I want to get it out of the way so
we can proceed to a lasting friendship.

11:08.365 --> 11:15.580
Sam just now mistook your innocent
flirtation for a sexuaI overture.

11:17.206 --> 11:21.085
Will you please explain to him
your reaI feelings?

11:24.296 --> 11:28.508
Sam, I want you
and I don't care who knows it.

11:28.675 --> 11:31.719
- What?
- Gotcha!

11:35.222 --> 11:40.560
You're very attractive, but for me to give
up my friendship, you'd have to be rich.

12:20.576 --> 12:24.329
- See you tonight for dinner. Bye.
- See you later.

12:24.496 --> 12:28.416
No, ma'am, I'm sorry.
Those cars start with gas!

12:31.001 --> 12:34.338
- Let's call your mother now.
- Get out of here!

12:37.007 --> 12:43.095
Whitey, whitey.
You're making a mistake.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.181
What do you mean?

12:45.348 --> 12:49.352
That so-called friend of yours
is hot for Sam.

12:49.518 --> 12:53.104
Everyone here is insane.
Why would you think that?

12:53.271 --> 12:56.858
- Sam thinks it.
- Not any more, he doesn't.

12:57.025 --> 12:59.485
I trust his first instincts.

12:59.652 --> 13:01.403
When it comes to dames,

13:01.570 --> 13:06.075
he's got an antenna
that picks up things we miss.

13:06.242 --> 13:11.120
Dogs and cats know there's an
earthquake coming. No one can explain.

13:11.287 --> 13:14.999
It's simple.
There are cracks on the surface of...

13:15.166 --> 13:17.835
Your brain.

13:18.794 --> 13:22.172
Please, don't distract Diane
from her suffering.

13:22.339 --> 13:25.092
Believe me, you're being dense.

13:25.259 --> 13:28.636
If Sam says she's hot for him,
bank on it.

13:33.099 --> 13:35.142
It's ludicrous.

13:36.935 --> 13:41.648
The more I think about this, the more
I'm looking forward to tonight.

13:41.815 --> 13:44.818
I've never had a woman
who's just a friend.

13:44.985 --> 13:49.154
- This will be really good for me.
- Tonight?

13:49.321 --> 13:53.617
Remember, you're cooking
that Oscar Mayer thingy.

13:54.951 --> 13:58.871
VeaI Oscar. Sam,
I've had second thoughts about that.

13:59.038 --> 14:03.459
Did you know that veaI
comes from baby cows?

14:03.626 --> 14:08.088
If you think I would take part
in such a senseless slaughter...

14:08.255 --> 14:12.259
Open a can of beans. The important
thing is getting to know Heather.

14:12.426 --> 14:18.806
I think just being friends with a sexy
woman is a big step in my maturity.

14:18.973 --> 14:22.435
We've got to get into the office
to get some stock.

14:22.601 --> 14:26.271
We're out of gin
and the Kahlua martinis aren't moving.

14:26.438 --> 14:31.443
I don't think you should come to dinner
when there's so much on your mind.

14:31.609 --> 14:35.237
- The dog and everything.
- I'll take care of the dog now.

14:35.404 --> 14:37.823
I'm one step ahead of you, Sammy.

14:40.367 --> 14:43.661
Mix a little complimentary cocktaiI
for the mutt.

14:43.828 --> 14:49.000
I got hold of the owner.
He said booze calms him right down.

14:49.167 --> 14:52.085
- I hope the guy's thirsty.
- Be carefuI.

15:12.604 --> 15:15.857
Oh, look at him.

15:16.024 --> 15:19.026
He's just a big puppy dog.

15:19.193 --> 15:22.738
You're a big doggie, yes, you are.

15:22.905 --> 15:28.035
There's only one problem. The owner
said booze makes the dog amorous.

15:28.201 --> 15:32.121
- Yeah? Right.
- Good boy. Yes.

15:32.288 --> 15:35.458
He's a good boy. Wait, not that good.

15:41.922 --> 15:43.965
Come on in, Heather.

15:46.718 --> 15:50.096
Something smells great.

15:50.262 --> 15:53.474
I thank you. Dinner's almost ready.
Make yourself at home.

15:56.768 --> 15:59.646
- Well, what do you think?
- About what?

15:59.813 --> 16:03.149
About this dress.
I saw it and had to have it.

16:04.317 --> 16:07.486
Why did you buy a dress
today of all days?

16:07.653 --> 16:12.115
You meet everybody, go out and get
a come-get-me dress. Explain.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.493
I just saw it today.

16:16.911 --> 16:22.625
Of course. You did what anyone
in your position would have done.

16:22.792 --> 16:26.044
- Diane, is everything all right?
- Yes.

16:26.211 --> 16:29.631
- Are you sure?
- Of course. Back to work.

16:32.342 --> 16:34.552
- I sure like Sam.
- Slut.

16:42.643 --> 16:46.312
- What?
- I said thanks a lot.

16:48.481 --> 16:50.525
You're welcome.

16:55.195 --> 16:57.239
Malone. One for dinner.

16:58.657 --> 17:02.994
- Do you have reservations?
- Plenty, but I came anyway.

17:03.160 --> 17:05.746
- How are you doing? Here you go.
- Nice. Thanks.

17:05.913 --> 17:10.875
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Sam. How are you doing?

17:11.041 --> 17:16.339
I want to apologise for this afternoon.
I was a little crazy.

17:16.506 --> 17:22.344
Here you go. I think the three of us
are gonna be reaI good friends now.

17:22.511 --> 17:25.180
Yeah, I think so too.

17:25.347 --> 17:28.767
- Me too. Well, let's get to dinner.
- What's the rush?

17:28.934 --> 17:32.478
The sooner we begin,
the sooner we can finish.

17:32.645 --> 17:35.231
And then we can be finished.

17:53.539 --> 17:56.542
- Isn't friendship great?
- Yeah.

17:58.501 --> 18:01.713
What's that saying
about friends and lovers?

18:01.880 --> 18:06.051
Friends and lovers.
Don't leave home without them.

18:06.217 --> 18:09.636
Very funny. You're ticklish. You are.

18:09.803 --> 18:12.181
You are. Oh, no. Please, please!

18:12.348 --> 18:14.141
Dinner time!

18:18.061 --> 18:21.898
You don't have to shout.
We can hear you.

18:22.065 --> 18:26.860
Of course. Hunger makes me
want to shout. Now, come on.

18:28.153 --> 18:30.280
Sorry I don't have place cards.

18:30.447 --> 18:33.366
We'll put Sam in the middle
so we can share him.

18:33.533 --> 18:35.534
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

18:35.701 --> 18:40.164
I think this is gonna be great. Just
the three of us. Three good friends.

18:40.331 --> 18:43.834
- Like Quartos, Athos and Aramus.
- There you go.

18:44.001 --> 18:47.087
I don't think Sam knows that reference.

18:47.253 --> 18:51.883
I may not read books, but I know
good music. Supremes, right?

18:52.050 --> 18:55.719
- Fabulous.
- Sometimes I surprise her.

18:55.886 --> 18:59.681
- I bet you do.
- Here we go.

18:59.848 --> 19:02.392
Hope you didn't have spaghetti for lunch.

19:03.851 --> 19:07.897
- I thought we were having veaI Oscar.
- There are remnants in the sauce.

19:09.857 --> 19:12.984
I thought we weren't gonna do anything
with veaI.

19:13.151 --> 19:16.780
This sucker was already dead.

19:16.947 --> 19:21.742
<i>- Well, it looks divine, Diane.
- Thanks. Bon appetit.</i>

19:24.787 --> 19:28.165
Remember the way
we used to eat "pasghetti"?

19:28.332 --> 19:30.959
- No.
- Like this.

19:43.720 --> 19:45.806
That was good.

19:45.973 --> 19:47.975
All right. Let me try.

19:55.398 --> 19:58.693
You got some sauce
on your blouse there.

20:00.151 --> 20:02.320
Thanks for your discretion.

20:02.487 --> 20:04.573
This is wonderfuI spaghetti.

20:08.159 --> 20:11.412
And the pasta is cooked just perfectly.

20:11.579 --> 20:16.292
It's firm yet it yields to the bite.
That's exactly the way it should be.

20:16.458 --> 20:19.043
Here. Take a bite off the end of this.

20:19.210 --> 20:22.380
- See? Perfect.
- Try mine.

20:23.840 --> 20:25.842
Yours is good too.

20:27.884 --> 20:29.928
Boy.

20:37.643 --> 20:42.690
This garlic bread is magnificent.
Here, have some of mine.

20:42.857 --> 20:46.985
- Hot, hot, hot.
- You don't even have to chew it.

20:47.152 --> 20:50.530
You just set it in your mouth and it melts.

20:51.740 --> 20:53.783
Goodies, goodies.

20:55.367 --> 20:59.913
- You have a little sauce right there.
- I don't wanna waste it.

21:00.080 --> 21:03.542
No, on the other side there.
There we are.

21:04.542 --> 21:06.544
Come on!

21:08.004 --> 21:10.590
- Stop it right now. I mean it!
- What?

21:10.757 --> 21:12.800
What?

21:12.967 --> 21:17.179
You know what.
You know perfectly well what.

21:17.346 --> 21:20.015
Think I don't know what's going on?

21:20.182 --> 21:23.559
Spaghetti, sauce, bread.
Have you no shame?

21:26.062 --> 21:30.191
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- I know what that was all about.

21:30.358 --> 21:34.319
You think I don't know
what noodles mean in sexuaI lingo?

21:34.486 --> 21:38.448
And sauce. I read my Freud.

21:38.615 --> 21:41.700
We were just enjoying the meaI.

21:41.867 --> 21:44.119
Don't give me that.
That meaI's inedible.

21:46.080 --> 21:51.250
You're doing the same thing I did
this afternoon and you called me nuts.

21:53.586 --> 21:56.422
No, Sam, it's all right.

21:56.589 --> 22:01.760
It's not surprising. I'm an outgoing
person. People misinterpret it.

22:01.927 --> 22:05.680
- I'm just surprised it came from you.
- Yeah. Me too.

22:12.686 --> 22:16.816
What am I saying? I must really be
paranoid, mustn't I?

22:19.859 --> 22:23.696
It's happened to me before.
It's happened to everyone.

22:23.863 --> 22:25.907
Heather...

22:26.825 --> 22:29.284
I'm so sorry.

22:29.451 --> 22:31.495
She didn't mean it, Heather.

22:35.457 --> 22:38.084
How can you be eating now?

22:39.252 --> 22:41.295
I've eaten through worse than this.

22:47.801 --> 22:51.054
- Goodbye.
- Heather, where are you going?

22:51.221 --> 22:55.809
- You're not leaving, are you?
- Paranoid or not, she's uncomfortable.

22:55.976 --> 22:58.644
Honestly, no.

23:02.398 --> 23:07.527
Our friendship is the most important
friendship in my life.

23:07.694 --> 23:13.658
And I would never, never do anything
to intentionally hurt it.

23:13.825 --> 23:15.868
Please forgive me and stay.

23:17.911 --> 23:21.874
Of course. I can't throw away 20 years.

23:25.835 --> 23:28.588
That's beautifuI.

23:28.754 --> 23:32.592
You know, I just wanna thank you
for letting me be part of this.

23:32.758 --> 23:36.720
- That was very sweet.
- Sam. You are so sweet.

23:36.886 --> 23:38.930
Hey, well...

24:23.219 --> 24:24.220
