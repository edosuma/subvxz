03:10.858 --> 03:12.778
Exterminator.

03:51.857 --> 03:54.737
You want I should spit
right in your face?

03:54.820 --> 03:58.578
- You want? You want?
- I ran out.

03:58.662 --> 04:01.625
You ran out? Oh, that's nice.

04:01.708 --> 04:06.385
It's impossible you run out!
What'd you do, eat the stuff?

04:06.971 --> 04:09.015
The Chink shortchanged me.

04:09.099 --> 04:11.688
No glot. Come Fliday.

04:16.531 --> 04:20.872
It's funny. It's actual very
funny what you just said.

04:21.374 --> 04:22.334
Ran out.

04:22.418 --> 04:25.006
They can either paint it,
or draw it, or write it down

04:25.089 --> 04:27.928
and then pass it on to somebody.
They read what you're saying,

04:28.012 --> 04:29.515
and then they reexperience.

04:29.599 --> 04:31.686
That's the only connection
you have with that.

04:31.769 --> 04:33.982
So you can't rewrite,

04:34.065 --> 04:37.113
'cause to rewrite is to deceive and lie,

04:37.196 --> 04:40.829
and you betray your own
thoughts. To rethink the flow

04:40.912 --> 04:45.380
and the rhythm and the tumbling
out of the words... is a betrayal.

04:45.464 --> 04:48.135
And it's a sin, Martin. It's a sin.

04:48.219 --> 04:51.726
I don't accept your
Catholic interpretation

04:51.809 --> 04:55.150
of my compulsive, necessity to rewrite

04:55.233 --> 04:58.322
every single word at
least a hundred times.

04:58.405 --> 05:01.663
Guilt is... Thanks.
Guilt is the key, not sin.

05:01.746 --> 05:04.878
Guilt re not writing
the best that I can.

05:04.962 --> 05:09.512
Guilt re not considering everything
from every possible angle.

05:09.595 --> 05:11.348
Balancing everything.

05:11.431 --> 05:16.109
How about guilt re
censoring your best thoughts?

05:16.192 --> 05:19.781
Your most honest,
primitive, real thoughts.

05:19.864 --> 05:23.539
Because that's what your laborious
rewriting amounts to, Martin.

05:24.040 --> 05:25.753
Is rewriting really censorship, Bill?

05:25.837 --> 05:28.883
Because I'm completely fucked if it is.

05:28.967 --> 05:32.432
Exterminate all rational thought.

05:32.516 --> 05:35.689
That is the conclusion I have come to.

05:35.772 --> 05:38.737
What is the man talking
about? I'm being serious.

05:38.820 --> 05:40.907
So is he.

05:43.162 --> 05:45.916
So how is the extermination
business going there, Bill?

05:46.000 --> 05:50.009
Somebody's stealing my roach
powder. Somebody's got it in for me.

05:51.053 --> 05:53.016
Bill, maybe you should
take it as a sign.

05:53.099 --> 05:55.394
Maybe you ought to try your
hand at writing pornography.

05:55.478 --> 05:59.027
Yeah, a novel a week at 120
bucks. It's serious money.

05:59.110 --> 06:01.325
I can connect you with the guy.

06:01.408 --> 06:03.703
We're thinking of
collaborating on one ourselves.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.708
I gave up writing when I was 10.

06:07.710 --> 06:10.675
- Too dangerous.
- Only if someone reads what you write.

06:10.759 --> 06:13.390
So far we haven't had that problem.

06:13.473 --> 06:16.813
- I've found my profession. I'm an exterminator.
- Of course, Bill.

06:16.896 --> 06:19.984
That's just what the world needs
more literate exterminators.

06:20.068 --> 06:22.031
Give me a cigarette.

06:25.414 --> 06:27.459
Of course, then, you know...

06:28.086 --> 06:29.212
you're gonna have trouble

06:29.295 --> 06:31.968
if you can't keep track
of your roach powder.

06:39.483 --> 06:42.405
Wait a minute. Do you boys
know something about this?

06:42.488 --> 06:44.702
We don't exactly know anything.

06:44.785 --> 06:48.919
No, but we suspect
it's a domestic problem.

07:22.444 --> 07:25.826
- My God, what are you doing?
- You weren't supposed to see this.

07:25.909 --> 07:29.374
Well, now that I'm
seeing it, what is it?

07:30.793 --> 07:33.507
I'm shooting up your bug powder.

07:33.590 --> 07:38.350
You might like to try it
yourself. Or you might not.

07:38.434 --> 07:41.441
I ran out in the middle of a job.

07:44.781 --> 07:47.493
You gotta stop using the stuff, Joan.

07:47.578 --> 07:49.540
They ration it out like snakebite serum.

07:49.623 --> 07:54.467
Just do what everybody else
does, cut it with baby laxative.

07:54.550 --> 07:58.016
The roaches will shit
themselves to death.

07:58.099 --> 08:00.479
It's the best job I ever had.

08:00.562 --> 08:03.359
If I run out again, I'm finished.

08:08.661 --> 08:10.749
It's...

08:13.253 --> 08:17.804
It's a very literary
high. Very literary.

08:17.888 --> 08:20.101
Is that why Hank and
Martin know all about it?

08:21.562 --> 08:25.569
We all just tried it
together-spur of the moment thing.

08:25.653 --> 08:27.741
They didn't like it, I did.

08:30.286 --> 08:33.294
What do you mean, it's a literary high?

08:34.128 --> 08:37.970
It's a Kafka high. You feel like a bug.

08:41.477 --> 08:43.565
Try some.

08:46.445 --> 08:48.533
Well, I don't know.

08:51.872 --> 08:53.961
I don't know.

08:56.966 --> 09:00.055
I think our metabolisms
are very different.

09:00.139 --> 09:02.728
Whose? Yours and Kafka's?

09:04.354 --> 09:07.070
I thought you were finished
with doing weird stuff.

09:08.573 --> 09:12.331
I thought I was, too,
but I guess I'm not.

09:17.674 --> 09:22.893
Personally... I prefer a
pyrethrum job to a fluoride.

09:23.728 --> 09:26.524
With the pyrethrum you
kill the roaches right there

09:26.608 --> 09:28.489
in front of God and the client

09:29.281 --> 09:32.161
whereas this starch and fluoride...

09:32.245 --> 09:33.665
leave it around, the roaches eat it...

09:33.748 --> 09:37.338
come back a few days later,
they're running around fat as hogs.

09:38.633 --> 09:41.639
And there it is, Bill. You
want to put on some weight,

09:41.722 --> 09:45.564
you gotta switch from that
yellow powder diet of yours

09:45.647 --> 09:48.987
to some of this good
fluoride stuff right here.

09:49.070 --> 09:52.327
Sure works for the Chink.
He's healthy enough.

09:52.411 --> 09:55.041
You see him scarf that poison down?

09:55.960 --> 10:00.093
He doesn't really eat
it. It's sleight of hand.

10:00.176 --> 10:01.469
The hell he doesn't.

10:01.554 --> 10:03.934
Been breathing in the powder so
long, it just makes him laugh.

10:04.018 --> 10:06.731
Just like them roaches.

10:19.798 --> 10:21.886
William Lee.

10:25.852 --> 10:28.691
- What is this?
- He's Hauser. I'm O'Brien.

10:28.775 --> 10:31.321
City Narcotics. We're gonna
take you downtown, Bill.

10:31.404 --> 10:35.914
Little matter of possession
of a dangerous substance.

10:42.386 --> 10:44.723
You've got quite a record, Bill.

10:44.807 --> 10:48.439
A lot of drugs poured down the old vein.

10:48.522 --> 10:52.864
I was a troubled person then.
I'm married now. Got a good job.

10:52.948 --> 10:55.745
That's good, Bill. That's nice.

10:57.665 --> 10:59.753
What's this, then?

11:00.004 --> 11:02.592
That's my job. I use it to kill bugs.

11:02.676 --> 11:05.890
- He says it kills bugs.
- He could be right.

11:05.974 --> 11:10.231
- I'd like to see it.
- Me too. I'd like to see it, too.

11:10.315 --> 11:12.403
Well, gee.

11:13.157 --> 11:14.366
I'd like to demonstrate,

11:14.450 --> 11:17.331
but I already got rid of
that last case of crabs I had.

11:18.499 --> 11:20.545
Very funny, Bill.

11:22.089 --> 11:24.177
But, you know...

11:25.138 --> 11:29.103
- I think we got a bug around here somewhere.
- You're right.

11:29.689 --> 11:33.278
Let's see if that yellow
stuff will kill it.

12:26.594 --> 12:30.393
We'll be back later to see
how it worked out, kiddo.

12:34.986 --> 12:37.073
Break a leg.

12:43.251 --> 12:46.217
William Lee? I have arranged all this

12:46.300 --> 12:49.348
just to have a moment alone with you.

12:49.431 --> 12:52.186
I am your case officer.

12:52.269 --> 12:55.360
- My what?
- Case officer.

12:55.443 --> 13:00.955
You are my agent. I, in turn,
report to your controller.

13:01.038 --> 13:05.755
Come, come, Mr. Lee. You don't
have to play dumb with me.

13:10.098 --> 13:13.521
- That would be foolish, wouldn't it?
- It would.

13:13.604 --> 13:16.819
Say, Bill... do you think you could rub

13:16.902 --> 13:20.118
some of this powder on my lips?

13:22.581 --> 13:24.668
Yeah.

13:24.793 --> 13:26.045
Sure.

13:36.735 --> 13:41.993
Well, now. As you might have expected

13:42.076 --> 13:47.046
I have instructions
for you from Control.

13:49.051 --> 13:52.724
It's about the little woman.

13:54.603 --> 13:59.320
- The what?
- The little woman. Your little woman.

13:59.403 --> 14:03.120
- Your wife.
- Tell me.

14:03.204 --> 14:07.421
Your wife is not really your wife.

14:07.505 --> 14:11.345
She is an agent of
Interzone Incorporated.

14:11.972 --> 14:15.436
You must kill her. Kill Joan Lee.

14:15.520 --> 14:19.111
It must be done soon, this week.

14:19.194 --> 14:22.993
And it must be done real tasty.

14:23.829 --> 14:25.622
Interzone Incorporated?

14:25.706 --> 14:27.919
An organization based in Interzone,

14:28.003 --> 14:32.470
a notorious free port on
the North African coast.

14:32.554 --> 14:36.478
A haven for the mongrel
scum of the Earth

14:36.562 --> 14:40.820
an engorged parasite on
the underbelly of the West.

14:40.904 --> 14:45.371
I can't see it. Why would a
classy American woman like Joan

14:45.455 --> 14:50.006
ever want to work for a two-bit
outfit like Interzone Incorporated?

14:50.089 --> 14:52.886
But who says Joan Lee is really a woman?

14:52.969 --> 14:57.604
In fact, who says she's human at all?

14:58.147 --> 15:02.530
- What do you mean by that?
- I can say no more.

15:08.167 --> 15:12.133
Hey, where you going? Don't
do it. There'll be hell to pay.

16:14.757 --> 16:18.224
We've been made. We
gotta get out of town.

16:18.307 --> 16:20.395
Wait a minute.

16:21.647 --> 16:25.029
- What's going on?
- I got busted for bug powder.

16:25.989 --> 16:28.411
I started hallucinating
behind the stuff.

16:29.622 --> 16:33.211
God knows what I really
said to those two flatfeet.

16:33.295 --> 16:36.384
I'm not even sure how
I got out of there.

16:36.592 --> 16:39.434
Did you bring back
tomorrow's bug powder?

16:40.100 --> 16:42.898
Did you, Bill? Did you?

16:44.443 --> 16:48.325
My God, Joan. You're acting
like a full-fledged junkie.

16:48.408 --> 16:51.916
And it's bug powder, for Christ's sake!

17:07.948 --> 17:11.037
I do have a little bit
of a habit, yes, hon.

17:11.329 --> 17:15.171
You ought to at least give me
a few marks for originality.

17:15.253 --> 17:18.135
How did you know it
just wouldn't kill you?

17:20.055 --> 17:22.143
I don't know, Bill.

17:25.023 --> 17:28.363
I felt drawn to it. You know?

17:29.491 --> 17:34.126
Like you feel drawn... to an old lover.

17:37.132 --> 17:39.219
Say, Bill...

17:39.512 --> 17:42.726
could you rub some of
this powder on my lips?

17:45.773 --> 17:48.488
Could you... Bill?

17:49.906 --> 17:51.618
Please.

18:44.349 --> 18:46.228
Hey!

18:48.608 --> 18:50.695
Bill.

18:53.701 --> 18:57.835
Where were you this morning?
We missed you at the Automat.

18:58.794 --> 19:01.675
I... got in a bit of a jam.

19:01.758 --> 19:05.308
I misplaced the gear,
in a manner of speaking.

19:05.558 --> 19:07.187
We heard about it.

19:07.269 --> 19:11.361
We saw you go off
with the heat, in fact.

19:12.113 --> 19:16.580
They won't give it back to
Cohen. It's evidence, they say.

19:16.663 --> 19:20.670
Yeah. It's an embarrassment, yes.

19:22.133 --> 19:25.263
Is that why you tried to lift mine?

19:27.894 --> 19:33.364
That's unkind, Edward."Lift" is unkind.

19:34.241 --> 19:38.207
I'm doing a job for a friend.

19:38.499 --> 19:40.378
The centipedes, Edward.

19:40.461 --> 19:43.633
The centipedes are getting
down right arrogant.

19:43.717 --> 19:47.935
- They're starting to attack his children.
- Take it from me, Bill.

19:48.769 --> 19:52.569
You're not the first one to
develop a bug powder problem.

19:52.652 --> 19:55.115
See this man.

19:56.201 --> 19:57.746
He'll help ya.

19:58.622 --> 20:03.591
Dr. A. Benway. General Practitioner.

20:04.843 --> 20:06.930
Bug powder?

20:07.600 --> 20:10.313
- You mean pyrethrum?
- Yes.

20:12.692 --> 20:16.533
I get a lot of you folks
in the extermination trade.

20:16.617 --> 20:19.957
You better help this friend of
yours get off the yellow stuff.

20:20.041 --> 20:24.049
- It'll kill him.
- How do I get him to kick?

20:24.674 --> 20:27.973
- Kick?
- How do I get him off it?

20:32.065 --> 20:34.151
Mix it with this.

20:34.276 --> 20:38.077
Gradually increase the percentage
of black without telling your friend

20:38.160 --> 20:42.085
and he'll lose his taste for
the bug powder soon enough.

20:47.887 --> 20:51.603
- What is it? What does it do?
- It's all natural.

20:51.687 --> 20:54.569
It's made from, aquatic
Brazilian centipede

20:54.652 --> 20:57.824
or some such outlandish thing.

20:57.907 --> 21:01.456
It shuts down the brain's response
to the bug powder. That's all.

21:01.540 --> 21:03.377
The powder becomes
irrelevant to the addict...

21:03.460 --> 21:06.216
and the addict then
ceases to be addicted.

21:07.468 --> 21:09.556
Side effects?

21:09.889 --> 21:11.978
Nothing that will surprise the addict.

21:13.397 --> 21:16.153
But, I before I do your cure

21:16.236 --> 21:18.782
I've gotta score some bug powder.

21:19.826 --> 21:21.913
Score?

21:22.832 --> 21:26.881
You're not trying to... pull a
fast one on the old doctor, are you?

21:26.964 --> 21:29.137
I came here for help.

21:30.098 --> 21:32.185
Of course you did.

21:37.654 --> 21:39.741
My God.

21:39.866 --> 21:43.833
It smells like a... tainted cheese.

21:46.045 --> 21:49.886
You'll see how elegantly this works.

21:50.846 --> 21:53.770
The black will disappear completely.

22:01.367 --> 22:04.917
And there'll be no
smell, no discoloration.

22:05.710 --> 22:07.380
It's like an agent.

22:07.463 --> 22:10.344
An agent who's come to
believe his own cover story.

22:10.428 --> 22:15.981
But who's in there,
hiding in a larval state...

22:16.064 --> 22:19.153
just waiting for the
proper moment to hatch out.

23:16.769 --> 23:18.896
Centipedes.

23:48.416 --> 23:52.090
"Followers of obsolete,
unthinkable trades...

23:52.591 --> 23:55.179
doodling in Etruscan...

23:55.429 --> 23:58.476
addicts of drugs not yet synthesized...

23:58.559 --> 24:03.153
black marketeers of World War III...

24:03.612 --> 24:07.995
excisors of telepathic sensitivity...

24:08.162 --> 24:10.459
osteopaths of the spirit...

24:11.042 --> 24:15.218
investigators... of
infractions denounced...

24:15.301 --> 24:18.768
by bland, paranoid chess players...

24:19.185 --> 24:22.942
servers of fragmentary
warrants taken down...

24:23.026 --> 24:25.406
in hebephrenic shorthand...

24:25.489 --> 24:30.331
charging unspeakable
mutilations of the spirit...

24:30.416 --> 24:35.302
officials of unconstituted
police states, broke..."

24:36.471 --> 24:38.557
Hi, Bill.

24:40.060 --> 24:42.482
Say, why don't you and I join them?

25:20.558 --> 25:24.065
Hank and I were just
bored. It wasn't serious.

25:24.148 --> 25:27.781
I didn't take it
seriously. Where is Hank?

25:27.865 --> 25:29.993
He got embarrassed and left.

25:31.328 --> 25:33.251
Not before he came, I hope.

25:33.333 --> 25:36.882
Hank's on junk. He doesn't come.

25:37.426 --> 25:39.972
Not before you came, I hope.

25:40.055 --> 25:43.728
I'm on bug powder. I don't need to come.

25:43.812 --> 25:48.614
"Officials of unconstituted
police states...

25:49.575 --> 25:53.582
brokers of exquisite
dreams and nostalgias...

25:53.665 --> 25:58.133
tested on the sensitized
cells of junk sickness...

25:58.217 --> 26:01.598
and bartered for raw
materials of the will...

26:01.681 --> 26:09.322
drinkers of the Heavy Fluid sealed
in translucent amber of dreams."

26:09.405 --> 26:13.789
I guess it's about time for
our William Tell routine.

26:55.539 --> 26:57.627
Oh, God.

27:03.764 --> 27:05.852
Joan.

27:08.024 --> 27:09.859
Oh, Joan.

27:50.984 --> 27:53.071
Are you a faggot?

28:00.169 --> 28:02.590
Not by nature, no.

28:02.715 --> 28:04.888
I'm not.

28:05.972 --> 28:08.060
I wouldn't say...

28:08.268 --> 28:10.856
faggot. No.

28:13.278 --> 28:16.201
However, circumstances
have forced me to consider

28:16.284 --> 28:18.162
the possibility that...

28:21.587 --> 28:24.384
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

28:24.634 --> 28:28.058
He specializes in sexual ambivalence.

28:29.352 --> 28:32.358
Sexual ambulance, did you say?

28:38.245 --> 28:40.248
My God.

28:40.331 --> 28:43.171
He's called Mugwump.

28:45.509 --> 28:47.639
No point in feigning surprise.

28:47.723 --> 28:50.895
You knew we would be
getting in touch with you.

28:50.979 --> 28:54.737
Why else would you come to
a waterfront dive like this?

28:55.947 --> 29:00.622
- Why else?
- I suggest a Clark Nova portable.

29:00.706 --> 29:03.336
It has mythic resonance.

29:03.420 --> 29:07.136
Clark Nova. A typewriter?
You suggest it for what?

29:07.219 --> 29:10.308
For your report from
Interzone, of course.

29:10.391 --> 29:14.318
Handwriting is not
considered professional.

29:14.401 --> 29:16.489
Interzone.

29:17.949 --> 29:23.251
- My report.
- And don't leave out any of the tasty details.

29:23.335 --> 29:25.799
The small red hole in the forehead

29:25.882 --> 29:31.017
or the look of astonishment on her face.

29:32.812 --> 29:36.610
Listen to me. You're just
gonna have to leave town

29:36.694 --> 29:40.786
and Interzone is the only place
that'll have a shady character

29:40.869 --> 29:44.293
like you at such short
notice. Take this.

29:44.377 --> 29:47.341
Take what? What is that?

29:47.425 --> 29:52.310
Your ticket to Interzone.
Tourist class, I'm afraid,

29:52.394 --> 29:55.566
but what can you expect these days?

29:56.610 --> 29:59.198
We'll contact you there.

30:35.522 --> 30:39.863
It's commie trash. And it's
been fired very recently.

30:40.072 --> 30:42.076
You use it in a holdup?

30:43.954 --> 30:47.379
I want that typewriter in the
window. I want the portable.

30:51.887 --> 30:53.975
This plus...

30:54.809 --> 30:58.734
8$. You got any ammo to go with it?

31:05.163 --> 31:07.750
These'll cover the state tax.

31:16.811 --> 31:18.565
Bill.

31:18.648 --> 31:20.652
Martin.

31:20.736 --> 31:24.661
Listen. I told the police it was
a drunken accident, that I saw it.

31:24.745 --> 31:27.500
So at least that's on the
record. They're after you though.

31:27.584 --> 31:29.921
They're saying that
you escaped from custody

31:30.004 --> 31:33.386
and murdered your
wife, and they want you.

31:35.432 --> 31:38.187
I'd better lie low till my ship sails.

31:38.270 --> 31:40.317
You booked passage somewhere already?

31:40.400 --> 31:43.405
Sure. Look. Got my ticket.

31:44.993 --> 31:47.540
Put this away, for God's sake, Bill.

31:47.623 --> 31:50.045
- I'll send you a report.
- You'll send me a report?

31:50.128 --> 31:53.050
I'll send you a copy of the report.

31:54.887 --> 31:56.976
Are you gonna be all right?

31:57.894 --> 32:01.150
I hear Interzone's really
nice this time of year.

32:55.218 --> 32:59.936
He woke up in bed to find himself wedged

33:00.018 --> 33:04.526
between a Dutch transvestite
and six Arab men.

33:07.826 --> 33:12.919
Clark Nova. Very nice
for writing reports.

33:15.632 --> 33:19.224
I use a Krups Dominator myself.

33:20.810 --> 33:23.230
Company policy.

33:32.833 --> 33:35.129
You're American, correct?

33:36.841 --> 33:39.095
You know Dr. Benway?

33:41.142 --> 33:47.738
I am interested in selling a
large stash of the black meat.

33:47.821 --> 33:51.954
Verstehen Sie? The
sun-dried, powdered black meat

33:52.038 --> 33:56.839
of the giant aquatic
Brazilian centipede.

33:56.923 --> 33:59.010
And...

34:00.556 --> 34:02.726
for some reason

34:03.311 --> 34:06.568
I am certain that you are working

34:06.652 --> 34:09.489
for Herr Dr. Benway.

34:12.663 --> 34:16.588
I'm sorry. I apparently
mistook you for somebody else.

34:16.672 --> 34:18.007
But as it happens, Mr. Lee,

34:18.090 --> 34:23.226
I am, among other things a provider
of rare services to the arts

34:23.309 --> 34:28.362
and in my experience as a provider
of rare services to the arts

34:28.446 --> 34:32.494
I have found that writers are
a particularly needy group.

34:33.163 --> 34:39.384
Is there nothing I can
provide for you. Mr. Lee?

35:10.821 --> 35:14.662
A very professional operation,

35:15.748 --> 35:18.337
as you can see, Mr. Lee.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.887
You like a taste?

35:23.847 --> 35:27.897
I'd be happy to join you in a taste,
if you're planning to have one.

35:47.644 --> 35:51.445
You can understand that if you were

35:51.528 --> 35:55.452
a purchasing agent for a foreign power

35:55.535 --> 35:58.708
how it would be to my advantage

35:58.792 --> 36:02.466
to impress you with the cleanliness

36:02.549 --> 36:07.058
and the sincerity of our operation.

36:09.939 --> 36:13.405
- You mentioned a Dr...
- Benway.

36:13.489 --> 36:15.827
- Benway.
- Benway. Correct.

36:15.910 --> 36:17.997
Yes.

36:18.999 --> 36:21.629
Does he qualify as a foreign power?

36:21.712 --> 36:25.053
Oh, but yes! He's very foreign.

36:37.411 --> 36:39.499
May I?

36:40.668 --> 36:42.754
Yes.

37:41.540 --> 37:46.549
Lee, wake up. This
is no time to doze off

37:46.632 --> 37:50.640
like a freckled-face
boy on a fishing raft.

37:55.275 --> 37:57.029
What's up?

38:02.582 --> 38:06.464
Now, now, Bill. No need for that.

38:06.547 --> 38:09.721
You didn't think we'd
abandon you, did ya?

38:10.389 --> 38:13.269
No. The thought never occurred to me.

38:13.645 --> 38:16.526
Good. We like confidence in an agent.

38:16.610 --> 38:20.159
But don't let it make you careless.

38:20.534 --> 38:23.081
I was... I was just in the...

38:24.709 --> 38:28.550
process of configuring my report.

38:29.051 --> 38:32.182
That's good, Lee. Admirable.

38:32.265 --> 38:34.520
But there have been some changes...

38:34.603 --> 38:37.317
- Changes at the top.
- Oh, yeah?

38:37.401 --> 38:41.409
Good changes, Bill. Fresh
blood. Sparkling insights.

38:43.539 --> 38:47.253
Bill, could you do me a favor?

38:50.344 --> 38:52.139
What?

38:52.222 --> 38:55.104
I want you to type a few words into me.

38:55.187 --> 38:58.109
Words that I'll dictate to ya.

39:00.405 --> 39:02.492
Yeah.

39:04.079 --> 39:06.167
Sure. What the hell.

39:15.560 --> 39:19.026
Okay. Now, the first sentence is,

39:19.151 --> 39:22.908
"Homosexuality is the
best all-around cover

39:22.991 --> 39:25.038
an agent ever had."

39:26.248 --> 39:28.169
Come on, Bill.

39:33.222 --> 39:35.350
Don't be such a pansy! Be forceful.

39:35.433 --> 39:37.605
Hurt me.

39:49.420 --> 39:55.140
I love it. That is a great sentence.

39:55.224 --> 39:58.354
These are words to live by, Bill.

39:58.438 --> 40:01.819
I'm glad these words are
going into your report.

40:02.529 --> 40:04.827
Our new management will be so pleased

40:04.910 --> 40:07.497
that you see our point of view.

40:10.294 --> 40:12.340
What point of view?

40:12.424 --> 40:16.558
Well, just that we
appreciate that you might find

40:16.641 --> 40:21.317
the thought of engaging
in homosexual acts

40:21.401 --> 40:24.740
morally and possibly even

40:25.366 --> 40:30.377
physically repulsive
and we are encouraged

40:30.461 --> 40:35.053
that you are able to overcome
these personal barriers

40:35.179 --> 40:40.146
to better serve the cause to
which we are all so devoted.

40:54.759 --> 40:58.809
You have left the Clark Nova at home?

40:59.143 --> 41:01.522
It's doing all right without me.

41:11.417 --> 41:13.504
And...

41:14.174 --> 41:17.847
you have contacted Dr. Benway?

41:20.728 --> 41:23.190
I told you before I never met the man.

41:23.273 --> 41:26.615
Bill, I can smell him on you.

41:27.491 --> 41:30.498
Benway marks out all
those whom he has met

41:30.581 --> 41:35.048
like a lemur pissing on a liana
vine to mark his territory.

41:36.341 --> 41:39.140
You're a marked man, Bill.

41:47.864 --> 41:49.702
Joanie.

41:50.161 --> 41:52.290
Joanie, shall we go?

41:53.042 --> 41:55.003
Yes. Yes.

42:02.895 --> 42:05.901
Hans. Hans, that couple.

42:05.985 --> 42:08.072
Who are they?

42:08.573 --> 42:11.703
They are Tom and Joan Frost.

42:12.331 --> 42:16.005
Americans who have lived
here a very long time.

42:16.088 --> 42:18.301
They're both writers.

42:18.384 --> 42:21.347
Writers of fiction, like you.

42:22.935 --> 42:24.898
They live in a nice flat

42:24.981 --> 42:27.612
in the new building at
the foot of the mountain.

42:27.695 --> 42:31.786
They're visited constantly
by many handsome,

42:31.870 --> 42:35.669
young Interzone men. Sometimes...

42:36.797 --> 42:39.719
two or three at a time.

42:42.014 --> 42:44.102
Can you introduce me?

42:44.394 --> 42:48.987
I do not think it would
be to your advantage.

42:50.240 --> 42:52.077
For some reason

42:52.160 --> 42:57.713
that woman has taken a
serious dislike to me.

42:58.130 --> 43:01.763
Kiki. Come sit with us.

43:08.149 --> 43:10.656
Kiki, this is Mr. Lee.

43:11.073 --> 43:12.994
Hello.

43:13.077 --> 43:17.502
Mr. Lee is curious
about the Frost couple.

43:17.586 --> 43:19.674
He would like to meet them.

43:20.424 --> 43:23.808
I think the woman would
have sex with you, Mr. Lee.

43:23.891 --> 43:27.773
The man, he only likes Interzone boys.

43:29.359 --> 43:32.532
I don't want to fuck 'em.
I just want to talk to 'em.

43:32.616 --> 43:37.418
You know how Americans are,
Kiki. They love to travel

43:37.501 --> 43:40.966
and then they only want
to meet other Americans

43:41.050 --> 43:45.434
and talk about how hard it
is to get a decent hamburger.

43:46.268 --> 43:48.857
There's a party tonight
at the O'Leary place.

43:48.941 --> 43:51.904
Frost will be meeting a group of us here

43:51.987 --> 43:54.577
and then walking through the casbah.

43:54.827 --> 43:58.460
My friends and I would be
happy to take you with us.

44:00.338 --> 44:03.260
You're the new writer, aren't
you? You've just arrived.

44:03.344 --> 44:06.476
A few days ago. I write reports.

44:06.559 --> 44:11.194
Oh! And did you come to
Interzone for the boys?

44:12.487 --> 44:15.201
- No, I didn't.
- Tom and I did.

44:15.285 --> 44:17.872
That's quite a hot
threesome you arrived with.

44:17.956 --> 44:21.046
They're very cheap, and
they're really a lot of fun.

44:31.568 --> 44:33.864
You use a Clark Nova, don't you?

44:37.955 --> 44:41.587
- To write with. Typewriter.
- I do. Yes.

44:42.214 --> 44:46.305
I wouldn't use a Clark
Nova myself. Too demanding.

44:46.389 --> 44:48.392
Demanding?

44:48.476 --> 44:52.942
Oh, come on. We're both writers.
We know what we're talking about.

44:53.193 --> 44:56.409
Well, I'm new to this
game, to tell you the truth.

44:57.453 --> 45:01.544
If I get blocked again, I'll
let you try my Martinelli.

45:02.128 --> 45:04.800
Her inventiveness will surprise you.

45:05.467 --> 45:07.807
I can't wait.

45:09.769 --> 45:14.486
They say you murdered
your wife. Is that true?

45:14.569 --> 45:16.657
Who told you that?

45:17.366 --> 45:21.917
- Word gets around.
- It wasn't murder. It was an accident.

45:23.714 --> 45:25.801
There are no accidents.

45:29.266 --> 45:31.353
For example,

45:32.982 --> 45:36.155
I've been killing my own wife
slowly, over a period of years.

45:36.238 --> 45:38.534
- What?
- Well, not intentionally.

45:38.617 --> 45:42.919
I mean, on the level of conscious
intention, it's insane, monstrous.

45:43.003 --> 45:46.885
But you do consciously know it. You
just said it. We're discussing it.

45:48.261 --> 45:50.349
Not consciously.

45:51.227 --> 45:53.732
This is all happening telepathically.

45:53.815 --> 45:56.988
- Nonconsciously.
- What do you mean?

45:59.242 --> 46:01.914
If you look carefully
at my lips you'll realize

46:01.997 --> 46:05.047
that I'm actually saying something else.

46:05.171 --> 46:07.258
I'm not actually telling
you about the several ways

46:07.342 --> 46:09.805
I'm gradually murdering Joan,

46:09.930 --> 46:13.438
about the housekeeper Fadela, whom
I've hired to make Joan deathly ill

46:13.522 --> 46:14.522
by witchcraft,

46:14.605 --> 46:17.781
about the medicines and
drugs I've given her,

46:17.864 --> 46:21.871
about the constant nibbling away
at her self-esteem and sanity

46:21.955 --> 46:26.255
that I've managed without
being at all obvious about it.

46:27.675 --> 46:31.641
Whereas Joanie finds
that she simply cannot be

46:31.724 --> 46:34.397
as obsessively precise
as she wants to be,

46:35.231 --> 46:38.487
unless she writes
everything in longhand.

46:40.741 --> 46:42.580
Look...

46:42.663 --> 46:44.749
I'm afraid...

46:46.295 --> 46:49.008
I'm not gonna be very
good company tonight.

46:49.676 --> 46:53.435
Thanks for the invite. I think
I'll have to take a rain check.

47:13.140 --> 47:15.228
Enjoying the beach?

47:20.071 --> 47:23.954
I would never have expected
to see you up and out so early.

47:25.248 --> 47:29.047
You certainly were in rough shape
at the O'Leary party last night.

47:29.131 --> 47:30.759
Was I?

47:34.099 --> 47:37.523
You were very raw. Emotionally, I mean.

47:37.606 --> 47:40.486
You seemed to be in a lot of pain.

47:44.745 --> 47:48.002
I don't remember... pain.

47:49.212 --> 47:52.971
In fact, I don't remember
the O'Leary party.

47:55.224 --> 47:57.730
In fact, I don't remember you.

47:58.564 --> 48:02.489
It was a very intense
performance in any case.

48:03.407 --> 48:05.078
My name's Cloquet.

48:11.339 --> 48:13.428
Yves Cloquet.

48:15.181 --> 48:17.645
Can I buy you breakfast?

48:28.290 --> 48:32.757
I've seen you around, but I
had no idea you were queer.

48:34.761 --> 48:39.814
- Queer.
- I saw you arrive with those three Interzone boys.

48:39.897 --> 48:43.112
What an entrance. You all looked very...

48:43.571 --> 48:45.908
familiar with each other.

48:47.454 --> 48:49.542
Queer.

48:50.877 --> 48:53.758
A curse. Been in our
family for generations.

48:53.842 --> 48:57.432
The Lees have always been perverts.

48:58.350 --> 49:02.359
I shall never forget
the unspeakable horror

49:02.443 --> 49:05.782
that froze the lymph in my glands

49:05.991 --> 49:10.834
when the baneful word
seared my reeling brain...

49:10.918 --> 49:13.005
I...

49:13.548 --> 49:15.385
was a homosexual.

49:17.180 --> 49:20.268
I thought of the painted,
simpering female impersonators

49:20.352 --> 49:23.151
I had seen in a Baltimore nightclub.

49:24.819 --> 49:29.412
Could it be possible I was
one of those subhuman things?

49:31.960 --> 49:34.047
I walked the streets in a daze

49:34.130 --> 49:38.890
like a man with a light concussion.
I would have destroyed myself.

49:40.936 --> 49:43.649
But a wise old queen...

49:44.275 --> 49:46.363
Bobo, we called her.

49:47.908 --> 49:49.745
Taught me that I had a duty

49:49.829 --> 49:54.630
to live and to bear my
burden proudly for all to see.

49:56.466 --> 49:59.472
Poor Bobo came to a sticky end.

49:59.724 --> 50:05.067
He was riding in the Duc
de Ventre's Hispano-Suiza

50:05.151 --> 50:07.906
when his falling hemorrhoids
blew out of the car

50:07.989 --> 50:10.286
and wrapped around the rear wheel.

50:10.369 --> 50:14.294
He was completely gutted,
leaving an empty shell

50:14.377 --> 50:17.926
sitting there on the
giraffe-skin upholstery.

50:23.104 --> 50:25.192
Even the eyes and the brain went

50:25.275 --> 50:29.574
with a horrible "schlupping" sound.

50:31.035 --> 50:32.539
The duke says he will carry

50:32.623 --> 50:36.380
that ghastly schlup with
him to his mausoleum.

50:39.511 --> 50:42.518
You sound as if you could use a drink.

50:42.892 --> 50:44.980
My place?

50:45.273 --> 50:47.360
A drink.

50:52.370 --> 50:54.457
A drink?

50:55.293 --> 50:57.380
No.

50:57.715 --> 51:01.723
No, I can't. I gotta go
home. I have a... I have a...

51:02.640 --> 51:05.563
I have a report to write. Excuse me.

53:11.649 --> 53:15.740
You made a big hit with
our young friend Yves.

53:19.790 --> 53:22.462
- Yves?
- Cloquet.

53:25.217 --> 53:27.763
Yves said you were wonderfully funny.

53:27.847 --> 53:30.352
Said you did a little
routine that made him

53:30.436 --> 53:32.815
chuckle to himself all day.

53:39.079 --> 53:41.792
Yes, you could...

53:44.047 --> 53:46.509
You could probably get him into
bed if you worked at it a bit.

53:46.593 --> 53:49.600
Deadly aphrodisiac, humor.

53:50.810 --> 53:53.774
I'm not... I don't really...

53:57.783 --> 53:59.954
Have you seen Hans around?

54:00.872 --> 54:03.377
You mean you haven't heard?

54:06.091 --> 54:09.932
- No. I haven't heard.
- Hans was arrested and deported two weeks ago.

54:12.103 --> 54:14.191
Deported?

54:16.445 --> 54:18.783
They let him take his
clothes and his passport.

54:18.866 --> 54:23.000
That was it. Everything else
nationalized, as they say.

54:25.129 --> 54:29.178
- Why?
- He neglected to pay the right officials, I think.

54:29.721 --> 54:33.103
You knew he ran a drug
factory in the medina?

54:37.446 --> 54:39.532
What...

54:41.786 --> 54:45.961
- What drug did he manufacture?
- Nothing too exotic.

54:46.462 --> 54:49.970
Majoun, I think. It's a
local hash resin-almond paste.

54:50.054 --> 54:55.272
You'd spread it on a
muffin like jam. Try it.

55:09.175 --> 55:12.808
While you're at it, why
don't you try my Martinelli?

55:15.187 --> 55:17.191
Take her now.

55:19.612 --> 55:21.700
Try her out.

57:10.960 --> 57:14.258
Holy shit. That machine doesn't
belong to me. It's Tom Frost's.

57:14.343 --> 57:15.427
My God, Lee...

57:15.511 --> 57:19.395
Surely you know better than to bring
an enemy agent into your own home.

57:19.478 --> 57:21.357
You gave me no choice.

57:21.440 --> 57:24.613
You were giving her access to
your innermost vulnerabilities

57:24.696 --> 57:26.742
forcing them on her, for God's sake!

57:26.826 --> 57:28.746
But what am I gonna tell him?

57:28.830 --> 57:30.875
What's your assessment of the situation?

57:30.959 --> 57:34.883
Did Frost know that his
machine was an Interzonal agent?

57:37.221 --> 57:41.480
He and his wife appear
to have a close connection

57:41.564 --> 57:45.195
with the indigenous population here.

57:46.615 --> 57:50.248
His wife. Yeah, yeah! Of course!

57:50.331 --> 57:51.959
The key is Joan Frost.

57:52.041 --> 57:56.509
You will seduce her, and you will
discover the substance of her report

57:56.593 --> 57:58.806
and deliver it directly to me.

57:58.890 --> 58:02.856
Seduce her? But what about
Kiki and the Interzone boys?

58:02.939 --> 58:04.861
- My cover.
- It'll work beautifully, Bill.

58:04.944 --> 58:08.868
The opposition will be
thrown into total confusion.

58:58.633 --> 59:02.224
- Tom's gone out with the boys.
- I came to see you.

59:24.060 --> 59:27.901
There's a great restaurant in
New York looks just like this.

59:28.402 --> 59:30.490
Oh, really?

59:41.302 --> 59:43.683
- You write in longhand.
- Yes.

59:44.644 --> 59:48.358
I'm not good with machines.
They intimidate me.

59:48.441 --> 59:52.284
- I think I broke Tom's typewriter.
- The Martinelli?

59:52.367 --> 59:55.497
- He'll be furious.
- Does he have another one?

59:55.581 --> 59:59.965
Yes, he has that one, the
Mujahideen. It's Arabic.

01:00:00.048 --> 01:00:03.472
- Does he use it much?
- Not much.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.561
What happened to the Martinelli?

01:00:06.644 --> 01:00:10.277
I probably just threw it
on the floor and smashed it.

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:12.616
Probably? You don't know?

01:00:12.699 --> 01:00:17.166
I suffer from...
sporadic hallucinations.

01:00:19.587 --> 01:00:21.674
Join the club.

01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:28.271
Do you intend to kill Tom's Mujahideen?

01:00:29.942 --> 01:00:32.030
Only in self-defense.

01:00:32.113 --> 01:00:34.284
I understood writing could be dangerous.

01:00:34.368 --> 01:00:37.791
I didn't realize the danger
came from the machinery.

01:00:37.874 --> 01:00:41.715
- What are you talking about?
- I'll show you.

01:00:49.398 --> 01:00:54.907
- Are you gonna write something in Arabic?
- No. You are.

01:00:55.994 --> 01:00:59.293
I don't like using Tom's things.

01:01:00.713 --> 01:01:02.841
We don't trespass on each other.

01:01:04.636 --> 01:01:07.934
Do you have any objection
to trying some of this?

01:01:10.607 --> 01:01:13.112
I can't read it. Is it erotic?

01:01:13.195 --> 01:01:15.491
It's... fairly erotic.

01:01:15.575 --> 01:01:18.038
- Kind of uncivilized.
- More erotic.

01:01:21.586 --> 01:01:25.928
- Filthier.
- Filthier? Okay. All you think about.

01:01:51.563 --> 01:01:53.859
Ooh, this is very good.

01:02:29.514 --> 01:02:33.147
Joan. Oh, Joan...

01:02:58.531 --> 01:03:03.457
Mrs. Frost! This is an evil and
insane thing that you are doing.

01:03:03.541 --> 01:03:05.752
You must stop it at once!

01:03:11.933 --> 01:03:14.019
Pull up your hair.

01:03:19.364 --> 01:03:21.453
Who's that?

01:03:21.578 --> 01:03:23.664
My housekeeper.

01:04:21.655 --> 01:04:24.160
It's my Mujahideen.

01:04:28.252 --> 01:04:30.549
For God's sake!

01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:45.953
It jumped of its own accord.
You did see that, didn't you?

01:04:50.337 --> 01:04:52.718
Joan, are you all right? What happened?

01:04:53.343 --> 01:04:55.765
Fadela stormed in here,

01:04:55.848 --> 01:04:58.436
and she threw your
typewriter out the window.

01:04:59.146 --> 01:05:01.193
That's it. The woman has to go.

01:05:01.276 --> 01:05:04.491
She certainly seemed deadly to me.

01:05:05.493 --> 01:05:07.454
I knew it.

01:05:08.875 --> 01:05:12.089
Look, Tom. Look.

01:05:16.139 --> 01:05:19.562
This is how Fadela's been
controlling you, Joan.

01:05:19.938 --> 01:05:22.276
Your blood, your pubic
hair, your fingernails.

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:24.823
Fadela controls nobody, and you know it.

01:05:24.906 --> 01:05:26.869
We have forced control upon her.

01:05:26.953 --> 01:05:29.456
Poor woman's probably desperate
to get out of our household.

01:05:29.541 --> 01:05:32.547
No, missus. She's making
you say everything,

01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:34.426
even that.

01:05:34.509 --> 01:05:38.684
You must find all of these in
your house. You must destroy them.

01:05:41.063 --> 01:05:45.780
Bill, I'm going to need my Martinelli.

01:05:47.869 --> 01:05:51.168
I feel desperately insecure
without a typewriter in the house.

01:05:52.003 --> 01:05:54.674
Yes, I haven't had a chance
to try it out yet, Tom.

01:05:54.758 --> 01:05:55.760
I was kind of hoping.

01:05:55.844 --> 01:05:59.183
I'll leave Hafid here with you,
Joanie, in case Fadela comes back.

01:05:59.266 --> 01:06:02.900
Bill and I will go to his place
and pick up the Martinelli now.

01:06:02.983 --> 01:06:07.240
I'll go with Bill. You two
stay here. I need to get out.

01:06:24.023 --> 01:06:27.658
Fadela's within 30 feet of
us. See if you can find her.

01:06:35.924 --> 01:06:39.222
There. She's right there.

01:06:50.076 --> 01:06:55.044
That thing she's cutting up...
have you ever seen that before?

01:06:55.128 --> 01:07:00.306
No. Looks like some kind
of sea creature, I think.

01:07:00.389 --> 01:07:04.313
All those women... they work for her.

01:07:05.691 --> 01:07:09.031
In a sense. They're all Fadela's lovers.

01:07:16.379 --> 01:07:19.010
I'm going to have to.

01:07:19.386 --> 01:07:24.188
I'm gonna have to stay here
with Fadela... do penance.

01:09:37.996 --> 01:09:40.124
I've been instructed to reveal to you

01:09:40.207 --> 01:09:43.799
that you were programmed to
shoot your wife, Joan Lee.

01:09:43.881 --> 01:09:47.515
It was not an act of
free will on your part.

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:50.895
Hey!

01:09:54.237 --> 01:09:56.325
Who the fuck asked ya?

01:09:58.244 --> 01:10:01.960
You worry me, Bill. You
cause me many anxious moments.

01:10:02.627 --> 01:10:05.802
Oh, gee, I hope you're
not losing any sleep.

01:10:05.886 --> 01:10:08.474
No need to be nasty, Bill.
There was some thought

01:10:08.558 --> 01:10:11.688
that you might actually want
to hear this information,

01:10:11.771 --> 01:10:14.860
that it might assuage your guilt.

01:10:15.446 --> 01:10:19.203
Save the psychoanalysis for
your grasshopper friends.

01:10:20.039 --> 01:10:24.672
You have to admit, it was
a pretty tasty setup, Bill.

01:10:24.756 --> 01:10:28.012
Joan marries you as part of
her agent's cover, not realizing

01:10:28.096 --> 01:10:31.727
that you were the very enemy
agent assigned to kill her.

01:10:31.854 --> 01:10:35.527
As elegant as it is brilliant.

01:10:43.878 --> 01:10:45.965
Wait a minute.

01:10:47.969 --> 01:10:52.604
You're saying that Joan was sent by
Interzone Incorporated to marry me?

01:10:52.688 --> 01:10:58.532
Yeah. In fact, she was sent to you
by Fadela, who was her controller.

01:10:58.615 --> 01:11:01.787
We did a lot of groundwork
to set you up in their files

01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:04.252
as the prime candidate for marriage.

01:11:04.335 --> 01:11:07.843
And it didn't matter that I
didn't know anything about it?

01:11:07.926 --> 01:11:10.973
An unconscious agent is
an effective agent, Bill.

01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:15.524
The situation does generate
some ethical paradoxes at times.

01:11:15.608 --> 01:11:18.113
I'm the first to admit that.

01:11:19.364 --> 01:11:23.915
When you bugs first approached me,

01:11:23.998 --> 01:11:27.632
one of your associates suggested

01:11:27.715 --> 01:11:30.638
that Joan was possibly not human.

01:11:31.432 --> 01:11:33.559
What did he mean by that?

01:11:33.643 --> 01:11:36.231
Women aren't human, Bill.

01:11:36.608 --> 01:11:40.824
Or perhaps more precisely, they're
a different species from men

01:11:40.909 --> 01:11:44.374
with different wills and
different purposes on Earth.

01:11:44.457 --> 01:11:46.711
You know this instinctively, Bill

01:11:46.795 --> 01:11:50.887
and it's your instincts that
make you such a good operative.

01:11:51.513 --> 01:11:54.226
I'm talking about Joan.

01:11:56.564 --> 01:11:59.278
If Joan Lee wasn't human,

01:12:00.406 --> 01:12:02.326
what was she?

01:12:02.410 --> 01:12:05.709
Well, Joan was a special case.

01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:09.842
Joan was an elite-corps centipede.

01:12:13.265 --> 01:12:15.352
Joan was a centipede.

01:12:23.367 --> 01:12:27.711
- Where's my Martinelli?
- Jesus, Tom, are you nuts?

01:12:27.794 --> 01:12:31.301
Don't fuck with me, Lee.
I want my typewriter.

01:12:33.136 --> 01:12:37.062
A lot of people have tried to
silence me. All have failed.

01:12:38.273 --> 01:12:40.362
Tom.

01:12:40.695 --> 01:12:42.782
She's here

01:12:43.241 --> 01:12:45.329
in pieces.

01:12:46.413 --> 01:12:48.503
I fear it's hopeless.

01:12:54.764 --> 01:12:57.937
All right. We're taking your Clark Nova.

01:12:59.733 --> 01:13:01.862
Hafid, the bag.

01:13:25.994 --> 01:13:27.580
What's going on here?

01:13:27.663 --> 01:13:30.209
Wait, wait! This is a
heinous mistake you're making.

01:13:30.293 --> 01:13:34.635
- Lee, do something. Stop them.
- He's got a gun, Clark Nova.

01:13:34.719 --> 01:13:37.016
You don't want to lose
your best agent, do ya?

01:13:37.099 --> 01:13:39.269
You're gonna have to
write a full report, Lee.

01:13:39.352 --> 01:13:42.902
- And I mean full.
- How am I gonna write it, in longhand?

01:13:42.985 --> 01:13:46.951
Will you take this sack
off! This is insubordination!

01:13:47.036 --> 01:13:51.085
You're all gonna pay for
this! Heads are gonna roll!

01:13:52.505 --> 01:13:54.384
Your days in Interzone
are numbered, Lee.

01:13:54.467 --> 01:13:57.474
I suggest you give up the writing game.

01:13:57.557 --> 01:13:59.977
Make tracks for another
part of the world.

01:14:07.076 --> 01:14:10.749
Fuck 'em all. Squares on both sides.

01:14:11.502 --> 01:14:15.174
I am the only complete
man in the industry.

01:14:42.897 --> 01:14:44.985
Bill.

01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:47.198
Bill?

01:14:55.087 --> 01:14:58.679
I must be hallucinating.
What are you cats doing here?

01:14:58.763 --> 01:15:02.353
We're here to see you, Bill. Come on.

01:15:02.436 --> 01:15:03.940
It's probably the first time

01:15:04.023 --> 01:15:06.694
you haven't been
hallucinating in a long time.

01:15:08.115 --> 01:15:10.620
What are you talking
about? What are you saying?

01:15:10.703 --> 01:15:13.207
Naturally, I've had a few odd moments.

01:15:13.291 --> 01:15:17.508
Everybody blacks out in
Interzone. Wouldn't you?

01:15:17.967 --> 01:15:20.140
- Definitely.
- Sure.

01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:25.399
What's in the pillowcase, Bill?

01:15:25.650 --> 01:15:29.783
These are the remains of
my last writing machine.

01:15:29.867 --> 01:15:32.246
It's been a big problem for me.

01:15:32.329 --> 01:15:35.293
- Mind if I take a look?
- Go ahead.

01:15:40.595 --> 01:15:43.268
Wait a minute. Where are we going?

01:15:44.353 --> 01:15:48.110
- Oh, man.
- How about back to your place?

01:15:48.194 --> 01:15:50.364
- Nope.
- Why not?

01:15:52.577 --> 01:15:55.585
I'm not safe there.
I'm a dead duck there.

01:15:56.212 --> 01:15:58.799
We'll protect you.

01:15:58.883 --> 01:16:02.723
You boys are kidding yourselves.

01:16:02.806 --> 01:16:06.898
- You're babes in the woods here.
- What do you suggest?

01:16:06.981 --> 01:16:09.569
We thought it was important for us
to help you get your book together.

01:16:09.653 --> 01:16:13.370
Yeah, I've sent sections of it to
my publisher, and they're interested.

01:16:13.453 --> 01:16:17.254
- All you gotta do is finish it.
- You've already done the hard part.

01:16:19.297 --> 01:16:21.386
Book. My book?

01:16:21.719 --> 01:16:24.267
Yeah. The one you've
been calling Naked Lunch.

01:16:30.028 --> 01:16:32.825
Where did you put that
Bradley the Buyer routine?

01:16:32.908 --> 01:16:36.124
- Did you find it all?
- Yeah. It's on the sofa

01:16:36.207 --> 01:16:38.712
right next to the
Hassan's Rumpus Room riff.

01:16:38.796 --> 01:16:43.138
- It's all right there.
- I never saw those pages before.

01:16:44.222 --> 01:16:47.438
I truly do suspect some
sort of colossal con.

01:16:47.563 --> 01:16:50.527
Someone's planted these
pages in your room, right?

01:16:50.611 --> 01:16:52.700
Somebody sent all those letters to me

01:16:52.782 --> 01:16:54.952
and signed them with your name, right?

01:16:56.164 --> 01:16:58.710
A well-orchestrated
cabal could easily manage

01:16:58.793 --> 01:17:01.341
all of these simple things, children.

01:17:01.423 --> 01:17:03.679
When will you learn?

01:17:03.763 --> 01:17:05.807
They've done you a
favor, 'cause this stuff

01:17:05.891 --> 01:17:09.608
is gonna get published under your
name, and you'll have a career.

01:17:09.691 --> 01:17:13.281
Yeah, you'll probably get
into print before we will.

01:17:13.365 --> 01:17:17.499
For God's sake, Bill, play
ball with this conspiracy.

01:17:17.582 --> 01:17:20.587
You're patronizing me, boys...

01:17:21.632 --> 01:17:24.762
but I don't mind, 'cause
you're so sweet to me, too.

01:17:25.806 --> 01:17:28.185
Hey, Martin, listen to this.

01:17:28.436 --> 01:17:31.150
"So we start for New Orleans past.

01:17:31.235 --> 01:17:34.615
Iridescent lakes and orange gas flares

01:17:34.699 --> 01:17:37.078
and swamps and garbage heaps...

01:17:37.495 --> 01:17:41.504
alligators crawling around in
broken bottles and tin cans...

01:17:41.587 --> 01:17:44.218
neon arabesques of motels...

01:17:45.011 --> 01:17:47.683
marooned pimps scream
obscenities at passing cars

01:17:47.767 --> 01:17:50.355
from islands of rubbish.

01:17:51.190 --> 01:17:53.778
New Orleans is a dead museum."

01:17:55.324 --> 01:17:57.411
So nice.

01:17:58.162 --> 01:18:00.250
Sound familiar, Bill?

01:18:02.047 --> 01:18:05.636
First time I ever heard it. Read on.

01:18:25.050 --> 01:18:30.101
I think it's time to
discuss your philosophy

01:18:30.184 --> 01:18:34.025
of drug use as it relates
to artistic endeavor.

01:18:34.651 --> 01:18:37.826
I think it's time to bring
this meeting to order.

01:18:38.743 --> 01:18:43.378
I think it's time for you
boys to share my last taste

01:18:43.461 --> 01:18:45.841
of the true black meat.

01:18:47.762 --> 01:18:52.772
The flesh of the giant
aquatic Brazilian centipede.

01:18:56.319 --> 01:19:00.120
So we're still here in
Interzone with Bill, right?

01:19:00.203 --> 01:19:04.170
- That's right.
- Now we're gonna travel back to the city, right?

01:19:04.253 --> 01:19:05.547
That's right, Hank.

01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:08.470
I think Bill's on top of
things here, don't you?

01:19:08.553 --> 01:19:13.898
He has a grip on a certain
unique reality principle, yes.

01:19:13.981 --> 01:19:16.235
I think you both should consider
staying here for a few months.

01:19:16.319 --> 01:19:20.159
Everything you could want
is cheap and plentiful here.

01:19:20.494 --> 01:19:23.709
That reality principle thing
could work for you, too.

01:19:25.128 --> 01:19:28.594
My mother's all alone, and
she's kind of sick, Bill.

01:19:28.677 --> 01:19:31.974
And besides, my book's as
all-American as football.

01:19:32.058 --> 01:19:33.685
Couldn't finish it here.

01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:36.609
America is not a young land.

01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:42.454
It is old... and dirty and evil.

01:19:42.538 --> 01:19:45.460
Before the settlers, before the Indians.

01:19:48.091 --> 01:19:51.472
The evil is there waiting.

01:19:58.446 --> 01:20:00.532
What about you, Martin?

01:20:03.122 --> 01:20:08.548
Maybe you can move into my
place. What do you think?

01:20:11.889 --> 01:20:16.814
Stay until you finish the
book, but then come back to us.

01:20:35.185 --> 01:20:37.272
You'll be okay?

01:20:40.027 --> 01:20:44.454
Yeah. Don't worry about me.
The Zone is full of surprises.

01:20:46.667 --> 01:20:49.338
The Zone takes care of its own.

01:21:28.625 --> 01:21:31.087
William?

01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:39.437
You look terrible.
What are you doing here?

01:21:41.651 --> 01:21:43.739
I don't know. I don't know.

01:21:45.952 --> 01:21:48.039
I just...

01:21:49.291 --> 01:21:54.886
My only fr... My only
friends in the world.

01:21:58.476 --> 01:22:02.359
I'm afraid I'll never see 'em again.

01:22:04.404 --> 01:22:06.784
I'm feeling so...

01:22:10.125 --> 01:22:12.129
Severed.

01:22:13.548 --> 01:22:16.890
Come with me. Take me home.

01:22:16.973 --> 01:22:21.732
I can't go home. I can't go home.

01:22:26.991 --> 01:22:30.206
Is that your typing machine there?

01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:32.336
Foutu.

01:22:32.419 --> 01:22:36.260
Broken... beyond repair.

01:22:37.889 --> 01:22:40.353
If we fix the typing machine

01:22:40.436 --> 01:22:42.815
we also fix the life.

01:23:02.688 --> 01:23:06.655
There. You see? There's
no cause for despair.

01:23:06.738 --> 01:23:09.828
In this shop, anything can
be fixed that is broken.

01:23:43.478 --> 01:23:45.523
I don't know, Kiki.

01:23:46.525 --> 01:23:49.866
They don't seem to be
capable of delicate work here.

01:23:49.949 --> 01:23:52.997
You must have faith, William.

01:23:53.998 --> 01:23:58.090
Look. We have your new writing machine.

01:24:32.909 --> 01:24:36.543
Not bad. Not bad. Not bad.

01:24:36.918 --> 01:24:39.758
I feel very comfortable
working with you.

01:24:39.841 --> 01:24:43.306
I like that sense of
camaraderie in an agent.

01:24:43.389 --> 01:24:46.227
You must be progressing.

01:24:46.311 --> 01:24:50.945
My predecessor felt you had an
ambivalent relationship with him.

01:24:52.784 --> 01:24:55.705
- You mean Clark Nova.
- Yes.

01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:58.085
How is he?

01:24:58.168 --> 01:25:00.590
He's still in the hands of our enemies.

01:25:00.673 --> 01:25:06.185
- Such are the hazards of our trade.
- A hazardous trade, yes.

01:25:07.228 --> 01:25:10.485
Your report on the subversive
activities of Joan Frost

01:25:10.568 --> 01:25:12.782
was a model of its type.

01:25:12.865 --> 01:25:16.372
If you continue to develop
your skills as an operative

01:25:16.455 --> 01:25:21.214
I think a top position with
the C.I.A. is not out of reach.

01:25:21.882 --> 01:25:24.054
The C.I.A.? You really think so?

01:25:24.430 --> 01:25:28.563
You have the demeanor. That's
something you can't buy.

01:25:30.191 --> 01:25:37.540
The C.I.A.

01:25:40.086 --> 01:25:44.595
That's a career you can really
sink your teeth into. It has...

01:25:46.307 --> 01:25:48.186
resonance.

01:25:49.731 --> 01:25:52.986
But giving yourself
over to being a writer...

01:25:58.248 --> 01:26:01.086
This stuff is very potent.

01:26:01.170 --> 01:26:04.050
The two are very closely related.

01:26:04.133 --> 01:26:06.096
So you boys keep telling me.

01:26:07.097 --> 01:26:10.981
Well, what's my next assignment?

01:26:11.190 --> 01:26:15.156
- I'm hungry for adventure.
- Excellent.

01:26:15.281 --> 01:26:18.788
You know the Swiss dandy Cloquet?

01:26:18.871 --> 01:26:20.959
- Yes.
- And?

01:26:23.673 --> 01:26:26.847
I think he's a faggito
and won't admit it.

01:26:26.930 --> 01:26:29.477
That ought to make it all easier.

01:26:29.561 --> 01:26:32.859
You will seduce or
otherwise compromise Cloquet.

01:26:32.984 --> 01:26:38.035
We have it on good authority
that he's our conduit to Benway.

01:26:38.578 --> 01:26:42.460
- Dr. Benway, M.D.,
Ph. D.? - Self-styled.

01:26:42.544 --> 01:26:45.509
He never actually made
it through medical school.

01:26:45.593 --> 01:26:47.554
He runs an interesting little show here

01:26:47.637 --> 01:26:52.188
which he calls Interzone, Inc.
Pretentious, if you ask me.

01:26:52.271 --> 01:26:54.318
Benway's behind Interzone, Inc.?

01:26:54.401 --> 01:26:57.617
The base of his pyramid is
a drug called the black meat.

01:26:57.700 --> 01:27:00.455
- The pyramid's tip...
- Is?

01:27:00.538 --> 01:27:02.627
Well, we'd like to know.

01:27:06.591 --> 01:27:08.679
Dr. Benway.

01:27:10.558 --> 01:27:13.146
- Of course.
- Yes.

01:27:14.191 --> 01:27:16.780
And he's obviously
got sensational cover.

01:27:16.863 --> 01:27:19.410
He's floated in and out
of the Zone for years

01:27:19.494 --> 01:27:22.082
without anybody
actually ever seeing him.

01:27:22.165 --> 01:27:27.676
- But now the pressure's on to place an agent close to him.
- Me.

01:27:29.096 --> 01:27:31.601
Assessments are being made.

01:27:49.846 --> 01:27:53.268
- You're working away, William?
- Yes, Kiki.

01:27:54.564 --> 01:27:58.279
The machine turns out
to be a very good one.

01:27:58.863 --> 01:28:00.950
Muy simpatico.

01:28:03.038 --> 01:28:06.463
And I have you to thank for it

01:28:06.546 --> 01:28:08.633
and so I will.

01:28:08.843 --> 01:28:10.929
Thank you.

01:28:12.432 --> 01:28:15.772
I'm very proud to be
your friend, you know.

01:28:17.193 --> 01:28:20.824
I'm very proud that I can
help you to be a writer.

01:28:22.285 --> 01:28:25.417
You have done that,
Kiki. You really have.

01:28:36.605 --> 01:28:40.321
- Would you like some tea?
- That would be lovely, William.

01:28:46.375 --> 01:28:48.420
Kiki.

01:28:50.341 --> 01:28:53.014
Do you know Cloquet?

01:28:53.097 --> 01:28:57.188
The Swiss man with the big
house on the Old Valley Road?

01:28:57.647 --> 01:28:59.735
Cloquet?

01:29:00.695 --> 01:29:04.329
Oh, yes, yes. Yves
with the wonderful car.

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:08.127
He has a wonderful car?

01:29:09.547 --> 01:29:12.009
The most wonderful car.

01:29:20.234 --> 01:29:22.155
Enjoying the ride?

01:29:22.238 --> 01:29:24.743
I'm wild about it, yes. Thank you.

01:29:25.244 --> 01:29:28.042
It's good to be wild sometimes.

01:29:29.503 --> 01:29:32.842
You know, I have often thought
of that funny story you told me

01:29:32.927 --> 01:29:34.764
the first time we met on the beach.

01:29:34.847 --> 01:29:37.143
The one about the Duc de Ventre.

01:29:38.563 --> 01:29:42.278
At first I didn't know how to take it.

01:29:42.362 --> 01:29:45.618
I thought you were making a pass at me.

01:29:48.624 --> 01:29:52.508
Did I ever tell you about the man
who taught his asshole to talk?

01:29:53.426 --> 01:29:56.433
His whole abdomen would
move up and down, you dig,

01:29:56.516 --> 01:29:58.811
farting out the words.

01:29:59.229 --> 01:30:04.281
It was unlike anything I ever
heard. Bubbly, thick, stagnant sound.

01:30:04.364 --> 01:30:06.785
A sound you could smell.

01:30:06.869 --> 01:30:08.749
This man worked for
the carnival, you dig?

01:30:08.832 --> 01:30:12.547
And to start with it was like
a novelty ventriloquist act.

01:30:12.630 --> 01:30:14.594
After a while, the ass
started talking on its own.

01:30:14.677 --> 01:30:17.057
He would go in without anything prepared

01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:21.190
and his ass would ad-lib and toss
the gags back at him every time.

01:30:22.818 --> 01:30:26.241
Then it developed sort of teeth like

01:30:26.325 --> 01:30:29.121
little raspy incurving
hooks and started eating.

01:30:29.206 --> 01:30:32.170
He thought this was cute at first
and built an act around it...

01:30:32.254 --> 01:30:34.216
but the asshole would eat
its way through his pants

01:30:34.299 --> 01:30:38.182
and start talking on the street
shouting out it wanted equal rights.

01:30:38.265 --> 01:30:40.144
It would get drunk, too,

01:30:40.228 --> 01:30:42.732
and have crying jags. Nobody loved it.

01:30:42.816 --> 01:30:46.073
And it wanted to be kissed,
same as any other mouth.

01:30:46.156 --> 01:30:48.412
Finally, it talked all
the time, day and night.

01:30:48.495 --> 01:30:50.331
You could hear him for blocks,

01:30:50.415 --> 01:30:55.048
screaming at it to shut up,
beating at it with his fists

01:30:55.132 --> 01:30:58.305
and sticking candles up it, but...

01:30:58.389 --> 01:31:00.811
nothing did any good, and
the asshole said to him,

01:31:00.894 --> 01:31:03.732
"It is you who will shut
up in the end, not me,

01:31:03.816 --> 01:31:07.574
because we don't need
you around here anymore.

01:31:07.657 --> 01:31:11.458
I can talk and eat and shit."

01:31:11.540 --> 01:31:13.879
After that, he began
waking up in the morning

01:31:13.962 --> 01:31:18.345
with transparent jelly like a tad
pole's tail all over his mouth.

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:23.356
He would tear it off his mouth and
the pieces would stick to his hands

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:28.449
like burning gasoline
jelly and grow there.

01:31:28.532 --> 01:31:33.333
So, finally, his mouth
sealed over and the whole head

01:31:33.416 --> 01:31:36.925
would have amputated spontaneously
except for the eyes, you dig?

01:31:37.008 --> 01:31:40.223
That's the one thing that the
asshole couldn't do was see.

01:31:40.306 --> 01:31:42.351
It needed the eyes.

01:31:42.769 --> 01:31:47.195
Nerve connections were blocked
and infiltrated and atrophied.

01:31:47.278 --> 01:31:50.701
So, the brain couldn't
give orders anymore.

01:31:50.953 --> 01:31:55.920
It was trapped inside
the skull... sealed off.

01:31:57.926 --> 01:32:01.598
For a while, you could
see... the silent,

01:32:01.682 --> 01:32:05.731
helpless suffering of
the brain behind the eyes.

01:32:07.736 --> 01:32:10.200
And then finally the
brain must have died

01:32:10.284 --> 01:32:12.787
because the eyes went out

01:32:12.871 --> 01:32:15.084
and there was no more feeling in them

01:32:15.168 --> 01:32:18.758
than a crab's eye at the end of a stalk.

01:32:31.033 --> 01:32:34.498
You seem to like my
little friend. I'm so glad.

01:32:34.581 --> 01:32:39.549
I'm writing a business piece on
corporate life in North Africa.

01:32:43.849 --> 01:32:48.359
Oh, my, my. We are
fragile today, aren't we?

01:32:49.486 --> 01:32:52.825
- He has to get to know you first.
- Oh, does he?

01:32:52.909 --> 01:32:55.331
Well, let's see what we can do, then.

01:32:58.463 --> 01:33:00.591
Kiki, will you come and
see the parrots with me?

01:33:00.675 --> 01:33:02.763
There are cages in the master bedroom.

01:33:02.846 --> 01:33:05.935
I don't think I can, Mr. Cloquet.

01:33:06.018 --> 01:33:09.025
That is, I don't really want to.

01:33:09.109 --> 01:33:14.160
I'd particularly like to
interview a certain Dr. Benway.

01:33:15.246 --> 01:33:18.586
Kiki doesn't seem to find my
parrots attractive anymore.

01:33:18.669 --> 01:33:20.298
Isn't that sad?

01:33:20.381 --> 01:33:23.513
Kiki would love to play
with your parrots, Yves,

01:33:23.597 --> 01:33:28.397
but Kiki is as anxious to contact
this Benway character as I am.

01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:33.408
Fadela, the witch who
works for the Frosts,

01:33:33.491 --> 01:33:37.248
she and Benway are... intimates.

01:33:37.499 --> 01:33:40.129
You didn't hear it from me.

01:33:41.381 --> 01:33:43.469
Kiki?

01:33:45.390 --> 01:33:49.565
Go see the fucking parrots, will
you, Kiki? I gotta take a piss.

01:33:51.694 --> 01:33:54.367
Then I'll come and get
you, and we'll go home.

01:33:54.450 --> 01:33:56.996
Pissoir's at the end of the great hall.

01:35:31.309 --> 01:35:34.024
Hello, Bill. What's up?

01:35:36.069 --> 01:35:38.114
Something the matter?

01:35:39.326 --> 01:35:41.789
You seem distracted.

01:35:46.841 --> 01:35:49.721
I wish you'd say something.

01:35:50.389 --> 01:35:54.856
- I don't like this mood. Are we going out?
- You're going out.

01:35:55.065 --> 01:35:58.906
Why don't you just write
something and calm yourself down?

01:35:58.989 --> 01:36:02.246
You're obviously not in a
professional state of mind.

01:36:02.330 --> 01:36:05.545
Maybe I should write about
your little double cross.

01:36:05.629 --> 01:36:10.305
You expected me to end up in that
parrot cage with Cloquet, didn't you?

01:36:11.138 --> 01:36:14.187
Bill, are you thinking
of getting rid of me?

01:36:14.270 --> 01:36:19.448
I think an exchange of hostages
is the only viable scenario.

01:36:19.531 --> 01:36:24.332
No, Bill, if you get rid of
me you sever ties with reality.

01:36:24.416 --> 01:36:29.551
For instance, take the case
of... Of the female agent

01:36:29.635 --> 01:36:33.559
who forgot her real identity
and merged with her cover story.

01:36:33.642 --> 01:36:36.525
She is still a fricoteuse in Annexia.

01:36:36.608 --> 01:36:40.322
And incidentally, you can make
a square, heterosex citizen queer

01:36:40.406 --> 01:36:42.785
with this angle using drugs...

01:36:45.708 --> 01:36:48.673
Tom, I've brought you a new typewriter

01:36:48.757 --> 01:36:51.804
which conveniently dispenses
two types of intoxicating fluids

01:36:51.888 --> 01:36:54.308
when it likes what you've written.

01:36:56.271 --> 01:36:59.820
Are you proposing to trade
back for your Clark Nova?

01:36:59.946 --> 01:37:01.992
Thinking of it.

01:37:02.576 --> 01:37:05.039
Has it written anything
good for you lately?

01:37:05.707 --> 01:37:10.174
No. It's too damned
all-American for my taste.

01:37:10.424 --> 01:37:13.180
Guess I've gone foreign or something.

01:37:14.475 --> 01:37:18.273
Well, my Mugwriter here is
so foreign, it's almost alien.

01:37:18.858 --> 01:37:22.991
You're gonna do your best
work on her. Guaranteed.

01:37:29.879 --> 01:37:31.759
Hafid,

01:37:31.843 --> 01:37:35.057
bring the machine in
question for Bill, will you?

01:37:48.334 --> 01:37:51.131
And how are you enjoying
your affair with Joan?

01:37:51.214 --> 01:37:54.889
Literate, complex and
neurotic, I would imagine.

01:37:59.105 --> 01:38:01.276
I haven't seen her for weeks.

01:38:02.404 --> 01:38:07.205
- She ran off with Fadela and her coven.
- That's too bad.

01:38:09.042 --> 01:38:13.426
Yes, she does that when she
feels attracted to a man.

01:38:13.968 --> 01:38:16.598
Don't give up though. It's a good sign.

01:38:17.433 --> 01:38:20.439
With Joanie the courtship period

01:38:20.523 --> 01:38:24.949
can involve years of
passionate ambivalence.

01:38:29.999 --> 01:38:34.509
Tom, I think we should take a
close look at his machine first,

01:38:34.592 --> 01:38:38.725
test it thoroughly. Don't you, Tom?

01:38:39.519 --> 01:38:43.192
You both have different writing styles.

01:38:43.276 --> 01:38:48.078
Bill Lee has always been a man
of powerful instinct, Hafid.

01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:51.711
If he says I'll do my
best work on his machine,

01:38:51.794 --> 01:38:54.382
I'm sure that's prophecy.

01:38:58.515 --> 01:39:01.229
Take the gun, too, Bill.

01:39:02.231 --> 01:39:06.281
No American should find himself
in a foreign land without a pistol.

01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:11.542
You wouldn't be trying to
set me up again, would you?

01:39:11.626 --> 01:39:14.756
You've set yourself up already, Bill.

01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:19.433
I'm just trying to give you
a fighting chance. That's all.

01:39:38.846 --> 01:39:40.933
Clark Nova.

01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:43.189
Clark Nova, it's me.

01:39:43.522 --> 01:39:47.406
It's Bill Lee. Clark Nova, speak to me.

01:39:47.531 --> 01:39:49.575
You're safe with me now.

01:39:50.244 --> 01:39:54.795
They tortured me. Did
unspeakable things to me.

01:39:55.463 --> 01:39:58.636
I'm on my last legs. The bastards.

01:39:59.930 --> 01:40:03.228
Clark Nova, where is Joan? Where's Joan?

01:40:04.814 --> 01:40:08.615
Hans's old drug factory in the medina.

01:40:08.698 --> 01:40:10.785
Fadela is there.

01:40:11.036 --> 01:40:16.296
Fadela is your point of
penetration into Interzone, Inc.

01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:19.385
Fadela.

01:40:19.552 --> 01:40:22.184
What do I do when I find her?

01:40:22.267 --> 01:40:26.232
You'll know what to
do when the time comes.

01:40:26.316 --> 01:40:28.362
Just remember this...

01:40:28.487 --> 01:40:34.041
all agents defect and
all resisters sell out.

01:40:35.042 --> 01:40:37.338
That's the sad truth, Bill.

01:40:37.421 --> 01:40:43.266
And a writer... a writer lives
the sad truth like anyone else.

01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:48.152
The only difference is...
he files a report on it.

01:40:49.696 --> 01:40:53.329
Leave me now, before it's too late.

01:40:53.413 --> 01:40:56.669
But wait. What about
Joan? What about Joan?

01:40:56.752 --> 01:41:00.427
Go now! Vaya con dios.

01:41:00.552 --> 01:41:03.432
Clark Nova. Clark Nova!

01:42:22.924 --> 01:42:25.012
Hurry. Hurry.

01:42:27.601 --> 01:42:29.645
Come on.

01:42:38.331 --> 01:42:41.628
Your notes must be much
more carefully detailed

01:42:41.711 --> 01:42:46.136
to be of any use to us.
You must write very clearly.

01:42:46.638 --> 01:42:50.062
The effects of the
drugs must be cataloged

01:42:50.145 --> 01:42:52.776
with painstaking accuracy.

01:43:12.273 --> 01:43:14.695
Joan.

01:43:15.989 --> 01:43:18.034
Bill.

01:43:18.786 --> 01:43:20.874
Oh, Bill.

01:43:30.727 --> 01:43:33.440
What is that? What are you writing?

01:43:33.648 --> 01:43:35.737
I'm writing...

01:43:36.489 --> 01:43:38.575
"All is lost.

01:43:39.745 --> 01:43:41.832
All is lost."

01:43:42.583 --> 01:43:44.671
It's all I've ever written.

01:43:49.891 --> 01:43:51.685
No.

01:43:51.769 --> 01:43:53.856
Oh, Joan.

01:43:55.275 --> 01:43:57.404
We have to see Fadela.

01:43:58.324 --> 01:44:00.410
Take me to Fadela.

01:44:20.827 --> 01:44:26.045
Lee, you're here. Thank God. Thank God.

01:44:26.129 --> 01:44:30.345
You see, my misdemeanor
has borne sweet fruit.

01:44:30.429 --> 01:44:32.559
Now you are with us.

01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:36.735
I was right to approach you so brazenly.

01:44:36.818 --> 01:44:40.699
And now Dr. Benway
will have no choice...

01:44:40.782 --> 01:44:43.663
- Benway.
- Benway.

01:44:45.877 --> 01:44:48.048
You'll see.

01:45:13.431 --> 01:45:15.853
I got to say I'm proud of you, sir.

01:45:15.937 --> 01:45:18.441
It took you a while, but
you got us red-handed.

01:45:18.525 --> 01:45:21.407
Full marks, boy. Full marks.

01:45:23.451 --> 01:45:27.501
I expected to see an operation
all out for the black meat here.

01:45:27.584 --> 01:45:29.756
What's with all the Mugwump jism?

01:45:31.928 --> 01:45:34.057
The black meat concession
turns out to have

01:45:34.141 --> 01:45:37.229
some unfortunate
political strings attached.

01:45:37.439 --> 01:45:39.609
We've just cut those strings.

01:45:39.692 --> 01:45:43.951
From now on, Interzone is
strictly Mugwump territory.

01:45:44.620 --> 01:45:47.334
As you can see, we've
made a flying start here

01:45:47.417 --> 01:45:49.378
with our modest dispensary.

01:45:50.465 --> 01:45:53.845
I can feel the heat
closing in on you, Fadela.

01:45:53.928 --> 01:45:57.394
Feel them out there making
their moves, you dig?

01:45:57.478 --> 01:46:01.903
Fadela.

01:46:05.828 --> 01:46:08.542
You mean this old thing.

01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:22.486
Benway!

01:46:24.908 --> 01:46:27.913
We met once before, remember? Stateside.

01:46:30.253 --> 01:46:33.551
You don't remember.
You had that look, boy.

01:46:34.886 --> 01:46:38.853
The look of a... sheep-killing dog.

01:46:39.145 --> 01:46:42.318
Decided to recruit
you right on the spot.

01:46:42.402 --> 01:46:45.032
I'm afraid I was forced
by the tenor of the times

01:46:45.115 --> 01:46:48.621
to prescribe that wretched black
meat powder to start you off on...

01:46:48.705 --> 01:46:52.423
but the hole-in-the-wall
operation, limited resources...

01:46:52.506 --> 01:46:55.136
you understand the problems.

01:46:55.219 --> 01:47:00.938
But I understand from Cloquet that
you're on to our good stuff now.

01:47:01.022 --> 01:47:03.819
Mugwump jism can't be beat.

01:47:03.903 --> 01:47:08.203
And as you can see, we've got
ourselves a few more friends now.

01:47:10.624 --> 01:47:13.338
And a few more dollars, too.

01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:18.933
This little... Fadela number
is something I developed

01:47:19.016 --> 01:47:23.734
during my tenure as chief physician
to the prime minister of Annexia.

01:47:23.818 --> 01:47:28.953
"El Primo" liked to walk the streets
amongst his people in drag, and...

01:47:29.496 --> 01:47:33.253
Well, one thing led to another.

01:47:37.385 --> 01:47:41.436
It-s an elegant way to strike
terror into the hearts of the enemy,

01:47:41.519 --> 01:47:43.107
wouldn't you say?

01:47:43.190 --> 01:47:47.115
Old Fadela must be on the rag.

01:47:47.699 --> 01:47:50.036
She's been acting subversive lately.

01:47:52.835 --> 01:47:56.424
Speaking of new uses for old technology,

01:47:56.507 --> 01:48:00.599
I think the new order could find
a place for a man of your caliber.

01:48:00.682 --> 01:48:02.771
A 32, wasn't it?

01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:06.528
That is what you're here for, isn't it?

01:48:06.612 --> 01:48:11.037
Hell... I could use a reliable
man to send to Annexia.

01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:15.212
We're expanding, boy.
I need a spearhead.

01:48:16.799 --> 01:48:19.595
Just tell me what you want.

01:48:21.642 --> 01:48:23.729
I want her.

01:48:25.566 --> 01:48:27.655
Her?

01:48:29.824 --> 01:48:32.329
That purulent little cunt? What for?

01:48:33.915 --> 01:48:36.712
I can't write without her.

01:48:40.931 --> 01:48:47.401
Bill, I feel confident that you
and I can work something out.

01:49:20.342 --> 01:49:22.053
Papers, please.

01:49:22.136 --> 01:49:26.020
What is the purpose of your
visit and what is your profession?

01:49:26.103 --> 01:49:28.108
I write reports. I'm a writer

01:49:28.192 --> 01:49:30.696
and I intend to write
reports on life in Annexia

01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:32.659
for the citizens of the U.S.A.

01:49:32.992 --> 01:49:34.746
Do you have any proof of what you say?

01:49:34.829 --> 01:49:38.169
How do we know you are really a writer?

01:49:39.130 --> 01:49:42.761
- I have a writing device.
- That's not good enough.

01:49:43.973 --> 01:49:46.060
Show us.

01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:49.609
- Show you.
- Write something.

01:49:55.035 --> 01:49:57.249
- Write something.
- Yes.

01:49:57.332 --> 01:49:59.420
Write something.

01:50:15.453 --> 01:50:18.499
Joan. Joan.

01:50:23.552 --> 01:50:27.268
What is it, Bill? Are we there yet?

01:50:28.394 --> 01:50:30.482
Almost, Joan.

01:50:32.904 --> 01:50:36.411
But I guess it's about time
for our William Tell routine.

01:50:38.039 --> 01:50:40.126
Sure, Bill.

01:51:33.401 --> 01:51:36.072
Welcome to Annexia.

01:51:36.823 --> 01:51:40.539
Yes. Welcome to Annexia.
