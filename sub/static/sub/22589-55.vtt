<i>NARRATOR".
Another groovy day in Gotham City...</i>

00:13.306 --> 00:18.228
<i>...and everything seems just right
in our teeming metropolis.</i>

00:19.646 --> 00:22.232
<i>But there's a new face in the crowd.</i>

00:22.857 --> 00:26.069
<i>The face of Black Widow.</i>

00:50.718 --> 00:53.972
Oh, good morning, madam.
May I help you?

00:54.138 --> 00:56.641
Yes, you may, doll.

00:56.808 --> 00:59.769
I would like to open
a tiny new savings account.

00:59.936 --> 01:02.355
- An excellent way to start the day.
-Yes.

01:02.564 --> 01:03.565
Come with me, please.

01:07.819 --> 01:09.404
Thank you.

01:15.410 --> 01:18.663
Now then, your name and marital status.

01:18.871 --> 01:23.418
Uh, Mrs. Max Black. Widow.

01:24.294 --> 01:28.256
How large an initial deposit do you wish
to make, Mrs. Widow?

01:29.299 --> 01:30.383
Mrs. Black.

01:36.764 --> 01:39.976
And now, Irv, darling...

01:40.184 --> 01:45.064
...will you bring me 20 or 30,000
from the vault?

01:59.912 --> 02:04.834
Ah. Sir, you're an absolute love. Ta-ta.

02:19.349 --> 02:25.396
- How did you do, Black Widow?
-Fine, Tarantula. I have done it again.

02:26.981 --> 02:30.026
There now, Mr. Cash,
this isn't the end of the world.

02:31.653 --> 02:37.200
There was this strange vibration
and then I'm handing her thousands.

02:37.408 --> 02:39.911
I couldn't stop myself.

02:40.119 --> 02:43.206
It was as though the devil himself
was at work on you.

02:43.414 --> 02:45.375
Or someone just as clever.

02:45.583 --> 02:48.044
Do you mean,
you know who pulled this job?

02:48.252 --> 02:51.798
You may not remember
but how could I ever forget.

02:52.006 --> 02:55.385
- Black Widow.
-Black Widow.

02:56.177 --> 02:57.303
You must be joking.

02:57.512 --> 03:01.474
I wish I were, Chief O'Hara,
but it all points to her.

03:01.683 --> 03:03.643
Opening a new account,
the huge handbag...

03:03.851 --> 03:06.521
...the black outfit,
the charm and fascination.

03:06.729 --> 03:09.607
Oh, that's her, commissioner.
Quick, catch her.

03:09.816 --> 03:14.195
Not quite that simple, I'm afraid.
But we, heh-heh, do have a chance.

03:15.154 --> 03:17.198
T-the dynamic duet?

03:18.032 --> 03:21.160
Duo. That's dynamic duo.

03:21.369 --> 03:23.663
The dynamic duo indeed.

03:23.871 --> 03:27.291
<i>NARRATOR". At this moment,
within the walls of stately Wayne Manor...</i>

03:27.500 --> 03:29.919
<i>...an unveiling is taking place.</i>

03:30.128 --> 03:31.587
How do you like them, Dick?

03:31.796 --> 03:34.632
Fine, Aunt Harriet,
but I already have a pair of black pants.

03:34.799 --> 03:37.552
Well, they're not for you, silly.
They're for me.

03:37.760 --> 03:42.473
I've decided to go mod.
Now what do you boys think?

03:42.682 --> 03:44.767
<i>Tres chic,</i> Aunt Harriet.

03:44.976 --> 03:48.104
Every bachelor in Gotham City
will be staring.

03:50.189 --> 03:55.778
I wanted to get a miniskirt, but the sales girl
wasn't sure I had the face for it.

03:57.488 --> 04:00.450
Oh, Alfred, how do you like my new outfit?

04:00.658 --> 04:03.494
<i>(Barnaby Street
has come to Wayne Manor, madam.</i>

04:03.703 --> 04:04.787
- Sir.
-Yes, Alfred.

04:04.996 --> 04:08.124
Mr. Gordon Commish is calling.

04:08.332 --> 04:10.543
Yes, we've been expecting his call.

04:10.752 --> 04:14.172
Uh, excuse us, Aunt Harriet,
we may be tied up for a little while.

04:14.380 --> 04:15.798
Dick.

04:16.841 --> 04:22.472
There they go, healthy as normal
and I'm such a beatnik.

04:22.680 --> 04:23.931
Yes, commissioner.

04:24.140 --> 04:27.852
Good to hear your voice, Batman.
You'll never guess who's in town.

04:28.060 --> 04:29.353
- Mr. Freeze?
-No.

04:29.562 --> 04:33.858
- Penguin, Joker?
-Black Widow has crawled into Gotham City.

04:34.066 --> 04:37.820
We're on our way. It's Black Widow.

04:38.029 --> 04:40.072
- The Black Widow?
-I'm afraid so.

04:40.281 --> 04:41.949
To the Batpoles.

06:12.248 --> 06:16.836
"Black Widow wins her victim's confidence
by pretending to open a savings account.

06:17.503 --> 06:20.923
Her methods of overpowering include
hypnosis, drugs...

06:21.132 --> 06:24.051
...and other artificial brain stimuli."

06:24.260 --> 06:26.220
Excuse me ignorance, Batman...

06:26.429 --> 06:30.099
...but what does a lady's hairdryer
have to do with all this?

06:30.308 --> 06:34.353
This, Chief O'Hara, in spite of its appearance
is a brainwave Bat-Analyzer.

06:34.562 --> 06:38.649
It registers the brainwave patterns in
the various control areas of the human brain.

06:38.858 --> 06:40.484
Most ingenious.

06:41.235 --> 06:46.824
Judging by her past modus operandi,
Robin and I suspect that Black Widow...

06:47.033 --> 06:50.661
...may have short-circuited
a portion of Mr. Cash's brain...

06:50.870 --> 06:54.040
...thereby rendering him incapable
of making judgments.

06:54.248 --> 06:58.252
Oh, this is worse than I thought.
First my money, now my brain.

06:58.461 --> 07:02.840
Easy, citizen.
Whatever she did in there will wear off.

07:03.049 --> 07:05.176
Sit down, please.

07:05.968 --> 07:09.305
Now, will you insert your head
in the Brainwave Bat-Analyzer.

07:09.513 --> 07:14.060
No cause for concern, Mr. Cash.
You can be sure, if it's Batman.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.771
If you say so.

07:20.816 --> 07:21.943
Cortex.

07:23.736 --> 07:25.237
Thalamus.

07:25.738 --> 07:28.824
Cerebellum not impaired.

07:30.576 --> 07:33.746
Medulla, A-okay.

07:38.084 --> 07:40.711
Holy nerve center, what is it, Batman?

07:42.088 --> 07:43.798
The cerebrum, Robin.

07:44.006 --> 07:47.593
Black Widow put Mr. Cash's
cerebrum out of commission.

07:47.802 --> 07:51.180
He was powerless to control his actions.
You can come out now, Mr. Cash.

07:51.389 --> 07:55.184
You-- You can come out now, Mr. Cash.

07:57.937 --> 07:59.605
Incredible.

07:59.814 --> 08:03.317
That secret weapon of hers, she could clean
out every bank in Gotham City...

08:03.526 --> 08:05.528
...and we'd always be one step behind her.

08:05.736 --> 08:07.822
Me men are clever, goodness knows...

08:08.030 --> 08:11.867
...but where the human brain is concerned,
they're just not equipped.

08:12.076 --> 08:13.661
How do we stop her, Batman?

08:13.869 --> 08:16.163
That is our problem.
We haven't a second to lose.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.416
- Quick, Robin, the Bat-Analyzer.
-Got it.

08:19.208 --> 08:21.961
Batman, am I going to be all right?

08:22.169 --> 08:24.338
Take two cold tablets
and get plenty of rest...

08:24.505 --> 08:27.466
...your cerebrum will be fine
in the morning, Mr. Cash.

08:33.806 --> 08:35.850
<i>NARRATOR".
Meanwhile, in the web...</i>

08:36.017 --> 08:39.061
<i>...an underground grotto
somewhere in Gotham City...</i>

08:39.270 --> 08:41.856
<i>...Black Widow
and her spidery companions...</i>

08:42.063 --> 08:46.318
...are <i>enjoying the fruits
of Black Widow's labor of love.</i>

08:46.736 --> 08:48.195
Ah-ah-ah!

08:48.362 --> 08:50.489
Don't touch, Tarantula.

08:50.698 --> 08:54.035
Well, I just wanted to run it
through my fingers, B.W.

08:54.243 --> 08:55.828
You will have to wait.

08:58.456 --> 09:01.459
I still have a fabulous list of banks...

09:01.667 --> 09:05.671
...I must clean out before we split.

09:07.923 --> 09:11.969
Trap Door,
what are you doing out of your trap door?

09:12.178 --> 09:16.474
- I got lonely.
-Oh, poor soul.

09:17.308 --> 09:19.435
I don't know how you do it, Blacky.

09:19.643 --> 09:22.730
I tried robbing banks
when I was younger...

09:22.938 --> 09:25.483
...but I always got nailed
before I was out the door.

09:25.691 --> 09:30.988
Incentive, Daddy Long Legs.
That's why you blew it.

09:31.197 --> 09:35.534
But didn't your husband Max always say
that money can't buy happiness?

09:35.743 --> 09:41.165
Happiness can't buy money. Heh.
Poor sweet Max.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.464
Why is it taking so long, Batman?

09:48.631 --> 09:51.801
Every known fact about Black Widow
has been fed into the Batcomputer.

09:51.967 --> 09:54.804
There were over 3,000 separate cards
to collate and analyze.

09:55.012 --> 09:58.516
Sorry, Batman,
but knowing that that arch-villainess...

09:58.724 --> 10:02.228
...may be robbing a Gotham City Bank
at this very minute bothers me.

10:02.436 --> 10:04.313
Bother you? It should.

10:04.522 --> 10:07.274
Just as it should bother any red-blooded
American citizen...

10:07.483 --> 10:09.777
...who recognizes the law and obeys it.

10:10.236 --> 10:15.116
<i>NARRATOR". At this very minute,
at yet another Gotham City Bank...</i>

10:17.952 --> 10:20.496
And by the way, doll...

10:20.704 --> 10:24.917
...bring me 20 or 30 thou
in small unmarked bills.

10:25.126 --> 10:27.336
Can you do that for me?

10:27.545 --> 10:32.174
Beneficial is here to benefit you, Mrs. Black.
You're sure that will fill your needs?

10:32.383 --> 10:37.429
How sweet of you to ask. Make it 40.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.899
"Black Widow Lingerie.

10:49.108 --> 10:52.361
Black Widow Weeds Removal Service.

10:52.570 --> 10:55.739
Black Widow Black Top Company.

10:55.948 --> 10:59.910
Black, Widow and Black Attorneys."

11:00.119 --> 11:02.663
But not one single bank.

11:03.455 --> 11:05.833
Seems to be hung up on the word "black."

11:06.041 --> 11:08.294
Maybe the Bat-Analyzing gears need oiling.

11:10.296 --> 11:12.965
- Yes, commissioner?
-it's Black Widow, Batman.

11:13.174 --> 11:16.427
In lightning fashion,
she's just hit four more banks...

11:16.635 --> 11:20.347
...and I have an office full of angry
bank managers. Any results at your end?

11:20.890 --> 11:23.267
Not yet, commissioner, I'm sorry.

11:23.475 --> 11:26.270
But I'm almost tempted to let her...

11:27.146 --> 11:28.772
Letter.

11:29.607 --> 11:32.193
Give me the names of the banks
Black Widow has robbed.

11:32.401 --> 11:34.403
Chief O'Hara, that list.

11:34.612 --> 11:38.282
Excuse me, gentlemen, excuse me.
Here you are.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.576
Ahem. Here we are, Batman.

11:40.784 --> 11:44.997
"American, Beneficial, Commercial,
Diversified, Empire, Federal State."

11:45.206 --> 11:48.375
It's simple as A-B-C, commissioner.

11:48.584 --> 11:50.836
Black Widow's going right through
the alphabet.

11:51.045 --> 11:55.132
No wonder the Batcomputer couldn't
figure out her plan. It was too easy.

11:55.341 --> 11:57.968
Commissioner,
the next robbery will obviously...

11:58.177 --> 12:00.804
...take place
at Gotham General Bank and Trust.

12:01.013 --> 12:03.682
Chief O'Hara,
I want every available unit dispatched...

12:03.891 --> 12:07.019
...to the Gotham General Bank and Trust.
-I have a better plan.

12:07.228 --> 12:10.147
Tell Chief O'Hara and his men
to sit on their tuffets...

12:10.356 --> 12:14.151
...so to speak, and stay away
from the Gotham General Bank and Trust.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.695
Repeat, stay away.

12:16.904 --> 12:22.243
Robin and I are less likely to frighten
this spider away.

12:34.088 --> 12:35.172
Pardon me.

12:36.090 --> 12:39.260
Have you been here long, citizen?
We're looking for Black Widow.

12:39.468 --> 12:43.597
I'm not too familiar with Gotham City
or any of its denizens, Batman.

12:44.390 --> 12:46.058
Ciao.

12:46.892 --> 12:48.394
Ciao.

12:52.106 --> 12:54.608
May we see the manager, please,
it's top priority.

12:54.817 --> 12:56.652
Do you wish to open a new account, sir?

12:56.860 --> 13:03.367
No, it concerns possible
criminal activity in this bank.

13:03.575 --> 13:05.619
If you'll just follow me.

13:07.162 --> 13:09.748
Mr. Leghorn, uh, two gentlemen to see you.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.875
T-two gentlemen?

13:12.084 --> 13:16.255
No lady or Black Widow
or anything like that?

13:18.507 --> 13:21.302
Batman and Robin here, Mr. Leghorn.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.763
Oh! Am I glad to see you.

13:26.557 --> 13:28.726
Mr. Leghorn, we have reason to believe...

13:28.934 --> 13:30.936
...Black Widow will attempt
to rob this bank today.

13:31.103 --> 13:33.814
Oh! Oh.

13:34.982 --> 13:38.485
There's no cause for alarm, Mr. Leghorn.
Robin and I will be hiding nearby.

13:38.652 --> 13:42.114
If and when Black Widow shows up,
act naturally and do exactly as she says.

13:42.323 --> 13:47.202
- We'll apprehend her at the right moment.
-If you say so, Batman.

13:47.411 --> 13:49.705
Act naturally.

13:54.793 --> 13:58.380
Well, we watch and wait.

14:06.597 --> 14:09.433
Steady, Robin. It's her move.

14:18.692 --> 14:19.902
Caught you, Black Widow.

14:20.110 --> 14:22.404
Thought you could rob
the Gotham General Bank?

14:22.613 --> 14:25.908
- Well?
-Mr. Leghorn, please!

14:26.116 --> 14:29.286
I thought I told you to act naturally.
This is Mrs. Harriet Cooper...

14:29.495 --> 14:33.165
...one of Gotham City's most law-abiding
and respected citizens.

14:33.374 --> 14:38.837
All I wanted to do was open a small savings
account for my nephew Dick Grayson.

14:39.046 --> 14:42.216
Forgive me, Mrs. Cooper.
Please let me explain.

14:42.424 --> 14:48.222
- Don't bother. There's always Beneficial.
-Good for Aunt Harriet.

14:49.932 --> 14:53.936
All right, Mr. Leghorn,
continue to act naturally.

14:54.144 --> 14:58.857
Act naturally. Act naturally. Act naturally.

15:12.121 --> 15:16.750
- M-may I help you?
-How do you do, doll?

15:16.959 --> 15:22.089
I would like to open a small savings account.
Oh, nothing pretentious.

15:22.297 --> 15:24.967
It's her. Let's move out.

15:26.135 --> 15:30.597
- Say, um...
-So, Black Widow, we finally meet.

15:30.806 --> 15:35.894
How perfectly thrilling. Ha, ha.
The caped crusader.

15:36.103 --> 15:39.815
And what a magnificent cape it is too.

15:40.023 --> 15:42.693
I really must have one of those
for my wardrobe.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.904
Don't waste your energy, Black Widow.

15:47.865 --> 15:51.994
Robin and I have been wearing
anti-short circuiting brain Bat-electrodes...

15:52.202 --> 15:54.872
...since your first day in Gotham City.

15:55.414 --> 15:57.624
Really, my sweet?

15:57.833 --> 16:01.503
Well, now, how about trying this on for size.

16:12.181 --> 16:16.435
Bye-bye, baby.
<i>Au</i> revoir, Prince Charming.

16:16.643 --> 16:17.936
Keep in touch.

16:20.105 --> 16:21.440
Batman?

16:21.648 --> 16:27.529
Feels like a paralyzing dose of spider venom.

16:27.738 --> 16:31.575
It should wear off presently.

16:31.783 --> 16:32.868
Let's go after her.

16:34.453 --> 16:36.497
She has a pretty good head start on us.

16:36.705 --> 16:38.790
I anticipated that.

16:38.999 --> 16:45.839
Robin, I installed
an odor-sensitometer radar circuit.

16:46.048 --> 16:50.260
- Holy olfactory.
-Right, Robin.

16:50.469 --> 16:55.432
The oil-and-gas mixture from her motor bike
will register on the sensitometer...

16:55.641 --> 16:58.602
...and be picked up as a blip
on the radarscope.

16:58.810 --> 17:02.856
All we have to do is follow that blip.

17:03.065 --> 17:06.443
- Ready?
-Are you, Batman?

17:06.652 --> 17:08.612
Never readier.

17:26.505 --> 17:30.759
- We're on target, Batman.
-But she seems to have disappeared.

17:35.889 --> 17:40.143
That elderly couple rocking on the porch.
Maybe they saw her.

17:41.270 --> 17:43.772
Hello, citizens, sorry to trouble you.

17:43.981 --> 17:47.234
We're looking for a lady on a motorcycle.
Have you seen such a lady?

17:49.903 --> 17:56.243
Haven't seen no lady on a bike in,
let's see, been eight to 10 years.

17:56.451 --> 17:58.829
Wouldn't you say that, Dad?

17:59.037 --> 18:04.459
I would say that, yes. About eight, 10 years.

18:05.210 --> 18:08.213
We're still getting the blips.
She must be somewhere around here.

18:08.422 --> 18:13.010
Say, aren't you that Bat fellow
and that Robin fellow...

18:13.218 --> 18:15.637
...who are constantly fighting evil?

18:15.846 --> 18:19.474
- Right you are, ma'am.
-Keep up the good work.

18:19.683 --> 18:25.606
Frank and I are both categorically
against evil.

18:25.814 --> 18:27.399
Thank you, senior citizens.

18:29.693 --> 18:32.195
They're driving away.

18:32.362 --> 18:33.363
Ha.

18:33.530 --> 18:36.742
Black Widow,
you've outwitted them again.

18:39.119 --> 18:43.790
<i>Say, aren't you
that Bat fellow and that Robin fellow...</i>

18:43.999 --> 18:47.294
<i>...who are constantly fighting evil?</i>

18:48.962 --> 18:52.007
Sounds perfectly normal on the
Bat-Tape Reader, doesn't it, Robin?

18:52.215 --> 18:56.261
Just the way it was picked up by
the Batmobile's ultrasonic recorder.

18:56.470 --> 18:58.805
Activate the Bat-Scilloscope.

19:02.934 --> 19:05.604
Now let's watch and listen.

19:06.146 --> 19:10.859
<i>Say, aren't you that Bat fellow
and that Robin fellow...</i>

19:11.068 --> 19:13.070
<i>...who are constantly fighting evil?</i>

19:16.073 --> 19:18.450
- No doubt about it.
-About what, Batman?

19:18.659 --> 19:22.788
That what we heard at the old frame house
were amplified human voices.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.164
To the Batmobile.

19:28.043 --> 19:29.461
Look, Robin.

19:30.295 --> 19:32.297
Three hours and they're still going strong.

19:32.506 --> 19:34.925
Thought they'd be off their rockers
by now, eh, Robin?

19:35.133 --> 19:36.301
Yeah.

19:36.718 --> 19:38.261
Come on, Robin.

19:54.486 --> 19:55.946
Rubber.

19:56.154 --> 20:00.701
So the voice we heard on that recording
was really sweet, little old Black Widow.

20:06.915 --> 20:13.547
Question, when you chase a spider,
where does he or she usually hide?

20:13.755 --> 20:16.133
Answer, under the house.

20:19.344 --> 20:23.348
Darlings, we're about to play
a dear little game.

20:23.557 --> 20:27.394
Spider and the fly.

20:27.602 --> 20:31.565
Come closer and pay attention.

20:31.773 --> 20:35.277
Strict attention.

20:45.954 --> 20:47.706
Robin, over here.

21:12.773 --> 21:16.818
<i>Welcome to the web, darling duo.</i>

21:20.572 --> 21:22.949
<i>Sic them, boys.</i>

21:34.711 --> 21:35.754
Ow!

21:39.466 --> 21:40.509
Batman!

22:05.742 --> 22:11.456
So, Latrodectus mactans, commonly known
as Black Widow, caught in your own web, eh?

22:11.665 --> 22:16.795
There is nothing common about me,
dynamic doll.

22:17.003 --> 22:20.298
And as for being caught in my own web...

22:20.507 --> 22:24.386
...may I give you a tiny, little piece of advice?

22:24.594 --> 22:27.931
If you wish to live and thrive...

22:28.723 --> 22:31.726
...let the spider run alive.

22:31.935 --> 22:34.813
Not a chance after all the evil you've done.

22:35.021 --> 22:39.526
Oh, well then, I'm afraid
I must do another evil deed.

22:42.028 --> 22:45.156
Not tonight, unless you can
arrange it from the Gotham City Jail.

22:49.494 --> 22:52.706
Batman, my arms and legs, I'm stuck.

22:52.914 --> 22:55.584
How ironic.

22:55.792 --> 22:58.753
Now it is you who are caught in my web.

22:58.962 --> 23:02.007
Frightfully cunning of me,
don't you think?

23:02.632 --> 23:05.260
You may have a slight advantage now but...

23:05.468 --> 23:09.264
Dear Heart, you may be caped...

23:09.472 --> 23:12.601
...and you may be dynamic...

23:12.809 --> 23:16.104
...but to me you are a crashing bore.

23:16.897 --> 23:19.107
So voila.

23:27.407 --> 23:30.118
I had them skip their dinner...

23:30.619 --> 23:34.789
...so they would thoroughly enjoy you.

23:50.055 --> 23:53.183
And now my lieutenants and I...

23:53.391 --> 23:59.648
...are going to tunnel into my vault
and count our lovely loot.
