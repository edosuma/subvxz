00:01.990 --> 00:06.989
Previously on "big
brother", Vanessa learned

00:06.990 --> 00:09.989
that she was a back door target.

00:09.990 --> 00:11.989
We have an alliance to
get you out.

00:11.990 --> 00:12.830
Me?

00:12.831 --> 00:16.829
And Liz quickly deflected
the blame to Steve.

00:16.830 --> 00:19.539
It was Steve's idea, to
bring Johnnie mack into it.

00:19.540 --> 00:23.409
So it looked like his
goose was cooked.

00:23.410 --> 00:25.989
When Liz confronted John
on the betrayal.

00:25.990 --> 00:28.989
The fact that you had to
do that, really pissed me

00:28.990 --> 00:28.991
off.

00:28.991 --> 00:31.989
The rock star dentist
stood his ground.

00:31.990 --> 00:35.989
You guys really go out of
your way to make me feel

00:35.990 --> 00:35.991
safe.

00:35.991 --> 00:38.989
Hold the phone, Liz,
yound Austin put me on the

00:38.990 --> 00:39.990
block.

00:39.991 --> 00:43.539
That's not what a good
alliance member does.

00:43.540 --> 00:46.989
After they did some
successful backpedaling.

00:46.990 --> 00:49.989
Johnnie mack considers
the ones that are going

00:49.990 --> 00:50.990
after you.

00:50.990 --> 00:51.990
I'm mad at Steve.

00:51.991 --> 00:53.989
Steve tries to explain
his actions.

00:53.990 --> 00:55.989
I'm putting it together.

00:55.990 --> 00:59.289
What do you mean, I'm
just you make it more shady.

00:59.290 --> 01:01.999
At the live eviction
Vanessa decided to give

01:02.000 --> 01:04.699
Steve her vote after all.

01:04.700 --> 01:09.409
Julie: By a vote of 5-0,
John, you are evicted from

01:09.410 --> 01:12.289
the Big Brother house.

01:12.290 --> 01:14.989
Moments after Johnnie
walked out the door, Julie

01:14.990 --> 01:18.989
made a surprise announcement.

01:18.990 --> 01:20.989
Julie: More people have
been sent to the jury house

01:20.990 --> 01:21.990
but tonight they are all back.

01:21.991 --> 01:25.989
And one of them will soon be
back in the game.

01:25.990 --> 01:31.989
And the jurors return
with vengence on their mind.

01:31.990 --> 01:34.989
Tonight which juror will
earn their way back into the

01:34.990 --> 01:34.991
game.

01:34.991 --> 01:38.989
And who will gain power as
the new head of household?

01:38.990 --> 01:43.119
Plus two new house guests
will be nominated for

01:43.120 --> 01:45.989
eviction and will Liz and
Austin make it official.

01:45.990 --> 01:46.990
Things are progressing.

01:46.991 --> 01:51.989
I think it's appropriate
that maybe I ask you

01:51.990 --> 01:52.990
something.

01:52.991 --> 01:59.989
All this right now on
"Big Brother".

01:59.990 --> 02:01.990
Well done
>> Julie: This competition

02:39.830 --> 02:44.989
begins now.

02:44.990 --> 02:49.989
Oh, that is not fun, no!

02:49.990 --> 02:53.989
Oh, that is big!

02:53.990 --> 02:54.410
Whooo!

02:54.411 --> 02:58.949
This competition is the
most... competition so far

02:58.950 --> 03:01.989
this this game there are
four jurors back in the

03:01.990 --> 03:02.990
competition right now.

03:02.991 --> 03:06.989
The last one of us standing
gets back into the game.

03:06.990 --> 03:10.989
And the last person standing
is hoh.

03:10.990 --> 03:14.989
So that means that I could
be going from the jury house

03:14.990 --> 03:21.949
to running the Big Brother
house.

03:21.950 --> 03:25.989
After being out on the
double eviction I'm back and

03:25.990 --> 03:25.991
ready to play.

03:25.991 --> 03:28.989
The only way for my game to
succeed is if I win hoh

03:28.990 --> 03:33.289
because if I don't, I feel
like I'll be right back up

03:33.290 --> 03:36.989
on that block.

03:36.990 --> 03:39.989
I really want to do well
this competition to make

03:39.990 --> 03:40.990
sure that Jackie can't come
back.

03:40.991 --> 03:43.989
I ruined her game by
evicting her and I'm afraid

03:43.990 --> 03:47.989
she could do the same to me
if I came back.

03:47.990 --> 03:49.989
Out of all the jurors I
absolutely do not want

03:49.990 --> 03:52.989
Johnnie mack back in this game.

03:52.990 --> 03:56.989
We agreed to work with him
and that's essentially

03:56.990 --> 04:00.989
sending out then essentially
sent him out the door.

04:00.990 --> 04:03.949
We could be royally screwed.

04:03.950 --> 04:04.989
Is that hard to hang on to?

04:04.990 --> 04:06.989
Yeah, oh yeah.

04:06.990 --> 04:08.989
It pushes you inappropriately.

04:08.990 --> 04:10.989
Ten minutes ago I walked
out the door and now the

04:10.990 --> 04:15.989
mack attack is back in like
a giant "Godzilla" monster

04:15.990 --> 04:17.699
smashing cities.

04:17.700 --> 04:20.989
Here to eat some brains.

04:20.990 --> 04:23.289
The second one is a slammer.

04:23.290 --> 04:25.539
This hoh say critical one
for me.

04:25.540 --> 04:27.989
A jury is coming back into
the game and I played a part

04:27.990 --> 04:29.989
in each one of them going home.

04:29.990 --> 04:33.119
Either I need to win this
thing or I need to be able

04:33.120 --> 04:34.989
to count on Julia or Liz.

04:34.990 --> 04:40.989
Oh my gosh.

04:40.990 --> 04:43.989
This head of household
competition is crazy.

04:43.990 --> 04:46.989
Not only are we spinning
around but we have to keep

04:46.990 --> 04:49.699
one foot on the disk at all
times.

04:49.700 --> 04:53.829
Luckily we can swap but one
foot has to stay on that

04:53.830 --> 04:53.990
disk.

04:53.991 --> 04:56.989
I'm going to get back in
this game because I want to

04:56.990 --> 04:57.990
see Vanessa leave this house.

04:57.991 --> 05:05.991
I have to win hoh.

05:06.990 --> 05:13.989
> Hey there, Mr. hands,
don't get fresh with me.

05:13.990 --> 05:14.990
Keep it above the belt.

05:14.990 --> 05:15.990
Ow!

05:15.991 --> 05:19.989
Man.

05:19.990 --> 05:19.991
Jeez.

05:19.991 --> 05:24.989
I'm getting dizzy, I'm
getting smacked by the hand.

05:24.990 --> 05:28.999
I feel like miley Cyrus on a
wrecking ball.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.989
Smack me around why don't you.

05:31.990 --> 05:33.989
The with the first four
jurors returning and playing

05:33.990 --> 05:36.989
in this hoh this is probably
the worst hoh to be sitting

05:36.990 --> 05:36.991
out.

05:36.991 --> 05:41.699
So now even more than ever I
need Liz or Julia to pull

05:41.700 --> 05:43.989
this one off for me.

05:43.990 --> 05:46.989
If John wins right now
things could get really

05:46.990 --> 05:49.989
messy.

05:49.990 --> 05:52.989
As soon as I hit the hand
I started spinning around

05:52.990 --> 05:56.409
like a dreidl and I cannot
stand dizziness.

05:56.410 --> 05:59.119
You know what, I knew this
was not going to be my

05:59.120 --> 05:59.990
competition.

05:59.991 --> 06:02.989
Getting off first is
absolutely humiliating.

06:02.990 --> 06:06.999
There is so much at stake
for this hoh competition and

06:07.000 --> 06:10.989
I'm just totally relying on
Liz and Vanessa to pull

06:10.990 --> 06:14.829
through and take one for
Austin's angels.

06:14.830 --> 06:15.989
Was it really hard to hold on.

06:15.990 --> 06:16.120
Yeah.

06:16.121 --> 06:23.539
Right away really hard?

06:23.540 --> 06:29.989
This competition is so
much harder than it looks.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.119
We have spinning so fast,
this thing is going around

06:32.120 --> 06:32.990
really, really quick.

06:32.990 --> 06:33.990
Our hands are hurting.

06:33.991 --> 06:38.409
Our arms are so sore, I've
got to hold on.

06:38.410 --> 06:42.989
I've got to stay on this thing.

06:42.990 --> 06:46.699
No!

06:46.700 --> 06:48.989
Although James and I have
been working with the twins

06:48.990 --> 06:52.289
an Austin the past couple of
weeks you can never trust

06:52.290 --> 06:52.990
any of that.

06:52.991 --> 06:56.989
So I got to figure out some
way to stand up on this disk

06:56.990 --> 07:01.989
so James and I can be safe
this week.

07:01.990 --> 07:03.989
I want to win this hoh
this week because I don't

07:03.990 --> 07:05.119
know who I can trust.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.989
The problem is my arms are
on fire right now.

07:07.990 --> 07:15.990
I did not ever imagine this
would be this hard.

07:25.990 --> 07:28.989
Once again... falls off
and it's up to me to win

07:28.990 --> 07:30.409
this competition for the
both of us.

07:30.410 --> 07:32.989
I can't have Shelli coming
back into the Big Brother

07:32.990 --> 07:38.119
house trying to get revenge
for me sending her man home,

07:38.120 --> 07:39.989
that can't happen.

07:39.990 --> 07:47.990
That was so hard.

07:49.990 --> 07:53.989
He is like a monkey, look
at him if I get back into

07:53.990 --> 07:55.989
this game I would want to
target James because

07:55.990 --> 07:58.989
obviously he put me and Clay
up on the block together and

07:58.990 --> 08:03.989
he got the ball rolling that
sent us both home and sent

08:03.990 --> 08:05.989
us apart.

08:05.990 --> 08:05.991
James!

08:05.991 --> 08:09.949
Oh my God what is he doing?

08:09.950 --> 08:13.989
It is real top heavy.

08:13.990 --> 08:15.989
I felt all the weight on
these arms.

08:15.990 --> 08:20.989
And I was like man, I don't
know how long I can hold on.

08:20.990 --> 08:28.990
Come on guys, you're
looking good.

08:34.990 --> 08:37.989
Just got eliminated from
the game and I'm feeling

08:37.990 --> 08:38.120
really sad.

08:38.121 --> 08:41.989
I really need Jackie, Jackie
or Johnnie mack to seal the

08:41.990 --> 08:45.989
deal on this competition and
send Shelli back to the jury

08:45.990 --> 08:45.991
house.

08:45.991 --> 08:49.989
Oh, man, that worked for me.

08:49.990 --> 08:51.989
That thing is hard.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.989
Vanessa is killing it, girl.

08:53.990 --> 08:55.989
Good work, you guys.

08:55.990 --> 08:58.539
It's really funny seeing
Vanessa hold on for dear

08:58.540 --> 08:58.990
life.

08:58.991 --> 09:03.989
Because if any one of us
four jury members win this

09:03.990 --> 09:07.539
competition, I know for a
fact her ass is on the

09:07.540 --> 09:15.540
block.

09:18.990 --> 09:20.989
Oh, Liz just got hit hard.

09:20.990 --> 09:22.119
I'm really struggling here.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.989
My feet start sliding
forward and I'm losing my

09:24.990 --> 09:26.409
fooding on the disk.

09:26.410 --> 09:28.989
It completesly turns
vertical into my butt and it

09:28.990 --> 09:31.699
is in a place where the sun
don't shine.

09:31.700 --> 09:34.989
Oh my God.

09:34.990 --> 09:35.990
It's all right, Liz, good work.

09:35.991 --> 09:38.989
If I fall I feel devastated.

09:38.990 --> 09:41.699
I look over and is the four
jurors and Vanessa.

09:41.700 --> 09:49.700
And I'm putting all my faith
in her.

09:59.990 --> 10:02.989
My feet slipped from
under me and I fall on my

10:02.990 --> 10:08.989
butt, and unfortunately I'm
out because you can't lose

10:08.990 --> 10:10.989
your feet from the disk.

10:10.990 --> 10:12.989
Love you.

10:12.990 --> 10:12.991
Ies... guys.

10:12.991 --> 10:13.990
Love you, Jackie.

10:13.991 --> 10:17.539
Get it, guys.

10:17.540 --> 10:22.949
Hold on, between all the
spinning and trying not to

10:22.950 --> 10:25.989
throw up I open my eyes just
long enough to realize that

10:25.990 --> 10:27.949
it's just the jurors and me
left.

10:27.950 --> 10:28.989
My feet are numb.

10:28.990 --> 10:31.989
I'm getting rope burn on the
inside of my arm but would

10:31.990 --> 10:34.989
you have to rip and pry me
off of this rope right now.

10:34.990 --> 10:37.989
There's no way I'm leaving
my fate in their hands.

10:37.990 --> 10:41.989
So now it's down to Becky,
Johnnie mack and Shelli and

10:41.990 --> 10:49.990
I'm praying that Johnnie
mack does not come back.

10:51.990 --> 10:53.949
The hand hits me and I fall off.

10:53.950 --> 10:57.119
I'm devastated that I cannot
reenter that bb house.

10:57.120 --> 11:05.120
By the same time I know I
gave that competition my all.

11:09.990 --> 11:12.989
Shelli's out, John has
earned his way back into the

11:12.990 --> 11:15.289
Big Brother house.

11:15.290 --> 11:17.989
Bye all, love y'all, John,
lovia.

11:17.990 --> 11:19.699
Oh my God!

11:19.700 --> 11:20.989
I'm back in the game this is
awesome!

11:20.990 --> 11:24.989
And I just got rehoh,
because if I don't there are

11:24.990 --> 11:28.989
a lot of people there that
will be just like send him

11:28.990 --> 11:29.999
back out again.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.989
It's down to the final
two, John versus Vanessa.

11:32.990 --> 11:35.409
Without ever is last to fall
will become the new head of

11:35.410 --> 11:35.990
household.

11:35.990 --> 11:36.990
This is unbelievable.

11:36.991 --> 11:39.829
It's down to Johnnie mack
versus Vanessa.

11:39.830 --> 11:40.989
The two arch-enemies.

11:40.990 --> 11:42.989
Not only is Johnnie mack
back in the house, but he

11:42.990 --> 11:43.990
could be hoh.

11:43.991 --> 11:47.989
And that freaks me out.

11:47.990 --> 11:50.989
He Dr. drill is back with
a vengence and this could be

11:50.990 --> 11:52.990
dangerous.

12:04.290 --> 12:07.289
It's down to Johnnie mack
and Vanessa and my heart is

12:07.290 --> 12:07.990
racing.

12:07.991 --> 12:10.989
Johnnie mack just went home
because I sent him home.

12:10.990 --> 12:17.989
If he comes back in this
house and wins hoh, I'm done.

12:17.990 --> 12:20.989
Is it hoh or out of them two?

12:20.990 --> 12:22.989
Yeah, one of them is hoh.

12:22.990 --> 12:25.989
John, John, John, I
really want to hear

12:25.990 --> 12:27.989
from... John, you're safe,
you're safe.

12:27.990 --> 12:31.999
I know I'm safe but I
got... I got to do way got to

12:32.000 --> 12:32.990
do.

12:32.991 --> 12:34.989
Johnnie mack is saying
that he's got business to

12:34.990 --> 12:36.989
take care of and he didn't
want to drop out of this

12:36.990 --> 12:37.410
hoh.

12:37.411 --> 12:39.989
Wasn't I the guy who just
took him out.

12:39.990 --> 12:44.989
How can that business not be
directed to me.

12:44.990 --> 12:47.989
You know Vanessa and I
have had our problems in the

12:47.990 --> 12:48.410
past.

12:48.411 --> 12:52.989
Just before my eviction
Vanessa and I smoothed

12:52.990 --> 12:55.989
things out.

12:55.990 --> 12:57.989
I I'm going after them no
matter what.

12:57.990 --> 12:58.990
Okay.

12:58.990 --> 12:59.990
Even though we are
working together, I can't

12:59.991 --> 13:02.989
let the rest of the house
think that me and Vanessa

13:02.990 --> 13:03.990
are cool.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.999
So I'm to the going to
accept this deal.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.989
I really want to hear from Mel.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.989
I want this thing...
>> I haven't gotten a letter

13:12.990 --> 13:14.289
at all.

13:14.290 --> 13:14.990
You're safe.

13:14.991 --> 13:16.949
I can go for a long time.

13:16.950 --> 13:20.989
Honestly, I could go for
another hour and a half.

13:20.990 --> 13:27.989
I really want, I do want
to hear from Mel.

13:27.990 --> 13:33.989
Hold on.

13:33.990 --> 13:36.409
Come on.

13:36.410 --> 13:38.989
My muscles are failing at
this point.

13:38.990 --> 13:43.289
My feet are starting to
slowly slip off the platform

13:43.290 --> 13:51.290
but I know I'm safe so whatever.

13:51.990 --> 13:52.990
Whooo!

13:52.990 --> 13:53.990
Yes.

13:53.991 --> 13:55.989
Vanessa is the new head
of household.

13:55.990 --> 13:59.989
Good job, man, good job,
congratulations.

13:59.990 --> 14:00.990
Good job.

14:00.991 --> 14:02.989
I'm elated to be heads of
house hold.

14:02.990 --> 14:04.989
After realizing that I was
everyone's target at some

14:04.990 --> 14:07.989
point over the last two
weeks I'm ready to flip this

14:07.990 --> 14:11.699
house on the head,
completely redrawn lines and

14:11.700 --> 14:12.989
anything is fair game.

14:12.990 --> 14:13.540
Vanessa.

14:13.541 --> 14:15.539
Vanessa winning hoh is
fantastic for us.

14:15.540 --> 14:18.409
We laid everything out on
the table and now we're back

14:18.410 --> 14:20.989
in good graces with her.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.829
Good job, John.

14:22.830 --> 14:23.989
Thank you.

14:23.990 --> 14:23.991
Whooo!

14:23.991 --> 14:25.989
You wanted it.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.989
Vanessa wins hoh and I'm
ecstatic right now.

14:28.990 --> 14:29.990
Oh my goodness.

14:29.991 --> 14:34.989
This is the biggest liar
I've ever met but I know

14:34.990 --> 14:36.989
she's going to be loyal to
me because she's at the

14:36.990 --> 14:41.289
bottom of that totem pole
with Austin and the twins.

14:41.290 --> 14:42.989
You get so dizzy.

14:42.990 --> 14:46.989
I bet, man, jeez, you
were spinning like crazy.

14:46.990 --> 14:50.539
I'm definitely nervous
that Vanessa is hoh.

14:50.540 --> 14:54.989
I'm sweating bullet, I hope
that me and Meg built up

14:54.990 --> 14:57.119
enough relationship for us
not to go up on the block

14:57.120 --> 15:02.949
this week.

15:02.950 --> 15:04.989
I get to hear from my
girlfriend!

15:04.990 --> 15:06.989
Holy.

15:06.990 --> 15:08.989
That was to the fun.

15:08.990 --> 15:13.989
S on oh my God.

15:13.990 --> 15:15.539
Oh.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.989
Oh.

15:17.990 --> 15:18.990
Welcome back.

15:18.991 --> 15:26.989
Welcome back.

15:26.990 --> 15:26.991
.

15:26.991 --> 15:30.989
You have no idea how
bad... who is your target?

15:30.990 --> 15:35.989
John is back in the house
and this is horrid for me is

15:35.990 --> 15:37.289
absolutely going after
Austin and I.

15:37.290 --> 15:40.989
So this is not go over well
with me.

15:40.990 --> 15:42.699
Hi.

15:42.700 --> 15:43.989
Hola.

15:43.990 --> 15:46.989
Johnnie mack.

15:46.990 --> 15:48.989
My blood is boiling.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.989
Hello, friends okay, okay.

15:51.990 --> 15:54.989
Johnnie mack is back.

15:54.990 --> 16:00.989
If he would have won, do
you guys realize how... within

16:00.990 --> 16:08.989
I'm going to be sick to my
stomach.

16:08.990 --> 16:14.989
> I'm so... I'm shaking.

16:14.990 --> 16:16.989
You're crying.

16:16.990 --> 16:18.989
No, I'm just so pissed.

16:18.990 --> 16:22.989
He has a vengence towards us
for like no reason.

16:22.990 --> 16:25.989
We're scared of Johnnie
mack at this point because

16:25.990 --> 16:28.989
we agreed to work with him
and Steve and we essentially

16:28.990 --> 16:30.989
put him on the block and
sent him packing.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.989
So the fact that he's back
in the house is terrifying

16:33.990 --> 16:33.991
to us.

16:33.991 --> 16:39.989
We need to get him out
before he targets one of us.

16:39.990 --> 16:42.989
I'm just so livid that
he's here.

16:42.990 --> 16:43.990
I know.

16:43.990 --> 16:44.990
I actually am.

16:44.990 --> 16:45.410
I know.

16:45.411 --> 16:46.989
Me too.

16:46.990 --> 16:48.989
Got to do what you got to do.

16:48.990 --> 16:50.119
What have you got to do.

16:50.120 --> 16:54.829
Walk around awkward like
you do all the time.

16:54.830 --> 16:55.989
I'm not going to be mean.

16:55.990 --> 16:58.949
Oh my God.

16:58.950 --> 17:00.949
I can't even deal with this.

17:00.950 --> 17:03.989
I think if anyone else
would have come back, it

17:03.990 --> 17:10.989
would have been better but
Johnnie mack, didn't you

17:10.990 --> 17:12.989
hate Vanessa this entire
game and now we're going to

17:12.990 --> 17:15.989
be so nice.

17:15.990 --> 17:23.990
Like don"t even unpack
>> I'm happy.

17:27.990 --> 17:30.119
The situation was
critical for my game.

17:30.120 --> 17:33.989
I feel like I just went from
a short stack at the table

17:33.990 --> 17:35.989
to doubling up and having
above average chips.

17:35.990 --> 17:38.989
It gives me the opportunity
to essentially press resets

17:38.990 --> 17:42.989
and redrawn lines so that
they favor me.

17:42.990 --> 17:45.989
I can't believe it.

17:45.990 --> 17:50.829
Oh, man.

17:50.830 --> 17:52.989
I'm stressing right now
that vaensa won hoh.

17:52.990 --> 17:54.989
I don't know where her head
is at in the game and I

17:54.990 --> 17:58.989
don't know how close she is
with Austin and the twins.

17:58.990 --> 18:03.989
My butt cheeks are puckered
right now.

18:03.990 --> 18:11.990
I don't want to go but I
want to go further.

18:12.990 --> 18:15.989
I don't think she's going
to go for...

18:15.990 --> 18:23.990
she might just come to us
randomly.

18:24.990 --> 18:25.990
She might think of that.

18:25.990 --> 18:26.990
She's not done.

18:26.991 --> 18:30.989
With Vanessa being hoh
this week I'm hoping that

18:30.990 --> 18:33.989
she sees Austin and the
twins as a bigger threat

18:33.990 --> 18:38.289
than me and James so we will
be able to stay if we can

18:38.290 --> 18:46.290
get through one more week,
we'll be doing good.

18:46.990 --> 18:47.990
Nice.

18:47.991 --> 18:52.989
Well, hello.

18:52.990 --> 18:56.699
That feels Austin to be
back in the Big Brother

18:56.700 --> 18:56.990
house.

18:56.991 --> 18:59.989
You all just he vicked me
and I'm back.

18:59.990 --> 19:01.989
Sorry, your plan worked.

19:01.990 --> 19:02.990
You're all messed up.

19:02.991 --> 19:09.119
Whether you know it or not I
feel safe this week do you

19:09.120 --> 19:10.989
trust her again.

19:10.990 --> 19:11.990
Oh yeah, yes.

19:11.991 --> 19:14.699
I'm really excited
Johnnie mack is back in the

19:14.700 --> 19:14.990
house.

19:14.991 --> 19:17.989
He is a really close friend
and apply.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.989
At the same time we now have
the problem that people know

19:19.990 --> 19:21.409
we're working together.

19:21.410 --> 19:22.989
That's with a target on my back.

19:22.990 --> 19:25.989
I don't want to do
anything too obvious right

19:25.990 --> 19:26.990
now.

19:26.991 --> 19:28.829
Let's be distant.

19:28.830 --> 19:36.830
Yes.

19:42.990 --> 19:43.990
> Did you fall off.

19:43.991 --> 19:45.989
Yeah, I did fall off.

19:45.990 --> 19:47.989
I was like if you were
going to fall off, why

19:47.990 --> 19:49.989
didn't you just take the deal.

19:49.990 --> 19:50.999
I couldn't take the deal...

19:51.000 --> 19:54.989
Vanessa approached me
with an interesting idea of

19:54.990 --> 19:56.989
working together if I come
back into the house.

19:56.990 --> 19:57.990
Surprise, I'm back!

19:57.990 --> 19:58.990
Let's do it.

19:58.991 --> 20:01.999
Let's go, let's go, let's
take these people out.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.949
It's crazy good job, girl.

20:05.950 --> 20:06.989
Did I win that?

20:06.990 --> 20:11.989
You got it.

20:11.990 --> 20:13.989
I love working with
Austin and the twins but at

20:13.990 --> 20:14.990
the end.

20:14.991 --> 20:18.989
Day I'm a fool if I don't
realize I'm at the bottom of

20:18.990 --> 20:21.699
their totem pool which means
I need other options in this

20:21.700 --> 20:22.989
house in order to survive.

20:22.990 --> 20:24.989
And having both Steve and
John available and in the

20:24.990 --> 20:27.699
house right now gives me a
wonderful opportunity to

20:27.700 --> 20:29.409
make a three person side
alliance with them that will

20:29.410 --> 20:32.989
give me a greater umbrella
of safety in the house.

20:32.990 --> 20:36.989
We should keep this going
but there is... everyone is

20:36.990 --> 20:41.989
like oh, we didn't... didn't
take it.

20:41.990 --> 20:44.539
They have no idea what is
going on.

20:44.540 --> 20:47.539
Crazy.

20:47.540 --> 20:54.989
Cool.

20:54.990 --> 21:01.829
> Oh my God, my worst
possible scenario.

21:01.830 --> 21:03.989
I done know why he turned
down my offer.

21:03.990 --> 21:06.989
It was weird he turned it down.

21:06.990 --> 21:07.990
I know.

21:07.991 --> 21:12.989
But the guy basically said
out loud I'm coming after

21:12.990 --> 21:13.000
Austin.

21:13.001 --> 21:14.949
He said I have business.

21:14.950 --> 21:15.989
I couldn't even hear t
doesn't matter.

21:15.990 --> 21:18.989
He made a direct shotment
I want to call him out.

21:18.990 --> 21:21.829
I need to do what is best
for my game.

21:21.830 --> 21:22.830
Whatever you want.

21:22.831 --> 21:24.830
What is best for you will
be best for us.

21:27.990 --> 21:28.990
> What?

21:28.990 --> 21:29.990
Yeah.

21:29.990 --> 21:30.990
What?

21:30.991 --> 21:35.989
There is no reason why we
can't win right now.

21:35.990 --> 21:36.990
There is no reason.

21:36.990 --> 21:36.991
I know.

21:36.991 --> 21:39.989
Before the eviction
Vanessa and I were able to

21:39.990 --> 21:41.989
talk through our problems
and we made amends.

21:41.990 --> 21:44.989
I want to apologize to
you for hurting you.

21:44.990 --> 21:47.989
I never wanted to cause you
pain I never wanted to hurt

21:47.990 --> 21:48.000
you.

21:48.001 --> 21:49.989
I never wanted to see you
like this.

21:49.990 --> 21:53.989
Even though we have what
we have, I can be a logical

21:53.990 --> 21:59.989
person in whatever, you know,
and do the best I can to

21:59.990 --> 22:03.989
forgive at this point I'm
feeling pretty good about my

22:03.990 --> 22:05.989
relationship despite all the
crap we've gone through in

22:05.990 --> 22:10.989
the last several weeks.

22:10.990 --> 22:13.699
I don't want to seem like
I'm pushing you around

22:13.700 --> 22:15.989
because you don't owe me
right now, I owe you the

22:15.990 --> 22:16.540
world.

22:16.541 --> 22:17.989
You're not pushing me around.

22:17.990 --> 22:20.989
I would be happy to help
I just want to make sure...

22:20.990 --> 22:24.989
I told you, Austin and
the twins obviously want me

22:24.990 --> 22:27.829
to go for him because he's
going for him.

22:27.830 --> 22:27.990
Right.

22:27.990 --> 22:28.990
I think it's best.

22:28.991 --> 22:34.989
Think about it.

22:34.990 --> 22:36.989
I know, I've been thinking
about it.

22:36.990 --> 22:38.989
I'm sure you know.

22:38.990 --> 22:40.949
You have been thinking about it.

22:40.950 --> 22:41.989
Okay.

22:41.990 --> 22:45.289
This week however I want
to make sure that Austin is

22:45.290 --> 22:48.989
being totally genuine with
me in his intention to go to

22:48.990 --> 22:50.990
the final five with me and
have my back all the way

23:01.990 --> 23:02.990
can't get enough of big brother?

23:02.991 --> 23:05.989
There is never a dull moment!
See what's happening

23:05.990 --> 23:08.070
inside the house whenever you
want with the live feed

23:10.990 --> 23:12.540
you know you want to watch!

23:17.990 --> 23:19.989
Assist her to the bathroom!

23:19.990 --> 23:20.990
Don't fight it, grandma.

23:20.991 --> 23:25.409
Even though I'm a
perfectly healthy

23:25.410 --> 23:29.989
25-year-old spunky girl, the
people in this house call me

23:29.990 --> 23:30.990
grandma.

23:30.990 --> 23:31.700
Grandma.

23:31.701 --> 23:34.989
The doctor says you
cannot fight this.

23:34.990 --> 23:36.989
Shall easy.

23:36.990 --> 23:37.990
Careful.

23:37.990 --> 23:38.990
Use the bars.

23:38.990 --> 23:39.990
Oh my God.

23:39.991 --> 23:43.989
Taking care of old
grandma may is very

23:43.990 --> 23:45.949
preshution responsibility.

23:45.950 --> 23:47.949
You just get your rest, okay.

23:47.950 --> 23:48.989
Oh my God.

23:48.990 --> 23:52.989
And I'll be back in about
an hour for your sponge

23:52.990 --> 23:52.991
bath.

23:52.991 --> 23:53.990
Oh my God.

23:53.991 --> 23:56.989
I can't stand you.

23:56.990 --> 23:58.989
That is why you are
laying down, you can't stand

23:58.990 --> 23:59.990
at all.

23:59.991 --> 24:01.999
She has her bad days.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.989
I'm going to bed soon.

24:03.990 --> 24:04.990
Oh.

24:04.991 --> 24:06.409
Her memory slips.

24:06.410 --> 24:07.699
I'm confused.

24:07.700 --> 24:09.989
Her temper gets a
little... you know, a little

24:09.990 --> 24:11.289
heated at times.

24:11.290 --> 24:12.989
It's grandma to you.

24:12.990 --> 24:13.990
Show some respect.

24:13.991 --> 24:16.989
Get the
delib... defibrillator, her

24:16.990 --> 24:16.991
heart.

24:16.991 --> 24:20.989
Makes you realize how
fragile life is and how fast

24:20.990 --> 24:21.990
it will pass you by.

24:21.991 --> 24:23.989
O my God, I just did it?

24:23.990 --> 24:24.700
What.

24:24.701 --> 24:26.539
I can never turn that washer on.

24:26.540 --> 24:27.989
Yeah, Meg.

24:27.990 --> 24:29.119
Grandma is getting used
to the new technology.

24:29.120 --> 24:31.989
She is used to the board
where they had to go up and

24:31.990 --> 24:33.989
down.

24:33.990 --> 24:35.989
The great side about this
is everyone loves your

24:35.990 --> 24:35.991
grandma.

24:35.991 --> 24:37.989
So you can't vote out
grandma Meg.

24:37.990 --> 24:38.990
I hate you!

24:38.991 --> 24:40.999
Today she just hates everybody.

24:41.000 --> 24:47.989
The doctor says it's normal.

24:47.990 --> 24:49.989
Who wants to see my hoh room!

24:49.990 --> 24:51.699
Oh my God.

24:51.700 --> 24:51.990
Yeah.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.409
We do, we do!

24:53.410 --> 25:01.410
All right.

25:05.990 --> 25:06.990
No way!

25:06.991 --> 25:11.989
Oh my gosh, I can't believe.

25:11.990 --> 25:12.990
Orxz.

25:12.991 --> 25:14.989
Is that her real hair no way.

25:14.990 --> 25:16.949
That her real hair, yeah.

25:16.950 --> 25:18.999
Talk about a breath of
fresh air, seeing pictures

25:19.000 --> 25:23.989
of Mel and my dog was like
much needed medicine.

25:23.990 --> 25:26.989
I feel like reinvigorateed
and I have what it takes to

25:26.990 --> 25:30.989
go to the end of this thing now.

25:30.990 --> 25:35.989
Bough chicka wow chicka.

25:35.990 --> 25:40.989
We got the same size hands

25:40.990 --> 25:43.989
yeah!

25:43.990 --> 25:45.989
I guess we didn't come up to
the hoh room to do arts an

25:45.990 --> 25:46.000
crafts.

25:46.001 --> 25:52.989
Where a picture of Vanessa's
hot mom.

25:52.990 --> 25:53.830
Let's hear it.

25:53.831 --> 25:56.989
My baby, I love so you
much my princess you are

25:56.990 --> 25:58.989
mine and only mine.

25:58.990 --> 26:00.989
I can't wait to you have by
my side.

26:00.990 --> 26:03.989
Keep your head high, my love,
we are missing you some of.

26:03.990 --> 26:05.989
We love you forever and always.

26:05.990 --> 26:07.989
Yay, she still loves me.

26:07.990 --> 26:11.989
Forever and always, Vanessa.

26:11.990 --> 26:19.990
You have no idea.

26:21.990 --> 26:28.999
Well, that is I'm feeling
pretty over it right now.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.989
They're not getting
the... back.

26:31.990 --> 26:33.999
Who are you thinking of?

26:34.000 --> 26:42.000
I mean... it is a layer of
perfection, an easy one to

26:42.990 --> 26:47.989
go after.

26:47.990 --> 26:50.409
I don't feel the same way.

26:50.410 --> 26:52.989
Yeah, but...
>> I have to do what is good

26:52.990 --> 27:00.990
for my game and I hate... I
kind of think... within

27:01.830 --> 27:04.989
Austin and the twins want me
to go after John but that is

27:04.990 --> 27:06.949
not what is best for my game.

27:06.950 --> 27:08.989
Given the conversation I had
with James this morning I

27:08.990 --> 27:11.989
don't think it will be a
tough sell to get them on

27:11.990 --> 27:14.989
board with Meg.

27:14.990 --> 27:17.989
I don't know if... I
don't know the story right

27:17.990 --> 27:18.540
now.

27:18.541 --> 27:22.989
Do we vote the person
that they want out?

27:22.990 --> 27:25.289
I don't know where you stand
at with them.

27:25.290 --> 27:26.120
We're probably next too.

27:26.120 --> 27:26.990
I don't know.

27:26.991 --> 27:32.989
I just feel like he
doesn't care at all that

27:32.990 --> 27:33.990
they're voting with me.

27:33.991 --> 27:35.989
Because they know they got them.

27:35.990 --> 27:37.989
We just want to make sure
we're not keeping him

27:37.990 --> 27:45.990
because he's going to do
whatever they want.

27:46.990 --> 27:52.989
You know they were kind
of... to see where they could

27:52.990 --> 27:54.989
put me I had to stay very even.

27:54.990 --> 27:57.989
I was like let me think
about it.

27:57.990 --> 28:05.990
James said I love the girls
and Austin but it's a game.

28:06.990 --> 28:10.989
That's why we need
to... that's why going for

28:10.990 --> 28:13.949
James is so much fun.

28:13.950 --> 28:13.990
You're right.

28:13.991 --> 28:15.989
You are a absolutely right.

28:15.990 --> 28:17.999
Vanessa has had her ups
and downs in this game.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.989
But after she reveals this
information, I one million

28:21.990 --> 28:23.949
percent do not trust Meg and
James.

28:23.950 --> 28:26.989
They have been riding on our
coattails for two weeks and

28:26.990 --> 28:28.989
I know that if they were the
ones in power they would

28:28.990 --> 28:30.989
have taken us out in a
heartbeat.

28:30.990 --> 28:34.989
I feel completely fooled by
them and I want them out I

28:34.990 --> 28:41.989
think this gets us to the
final five an possibly final

28:41.990 --> 28:43.990
four.

28:58.990 --> 29:00.990
Be a fly on the wall inside
the Big Brother house

29:02.990 --> 29:05.030
watch the houseguest at any time
with the live feeds

29:20.830 --> 29:21.989
you look very lovely

29:21.990 --> 29:23.989
thanks for joining me tonight.

29:23.990 --> 29:24.990
This is really nice.

29:24.991 --> 29:28.829
It means a lot to me.

29:28.830 --> 29:31.989
It's nice.

29:31.990 --> 29:34.289
When... came in last week
Liz and I hit a bit of a

29:34.290 --> 29:36.989
rough patch but Liz is
someone that is genuinely

29:36.990 --> 29:39.989
special to me and I want to
build a relationship with

29:39.990 --> 29:40.700
her outside of this house.

29:40.701 --> 29:42.989
You know, I would like to
see you outside of here

29:42.990 --> 29:45.989
because things are
progressing and I think it's

29:45.990 --> 29:49.829
appropriate that maybe I ask
you something.

29:49.830 --> 29:50.989
What do you want to ask me?

29:50.990 --> 29:58.990
Will you be my girlfriend?

29:59.990 --> 30:02.989
That's very respectful,
so thank you.

30:02.990 --> 30:04.699
Thank you.

30:04.700 --> 30:12.700
And to answer your
question, yes, I will be

30:13.410 --> 30:14.410
your girlfriend.

30:14.411 --> 30:18.989
Oh, wow, thank you.

30:18.990 --> 30:23.989
This is so awkward.

30:23.990 --> 30:27.989
I feel like I'm on cloud
nine being Austin's official

30:27.990 --> 30:28.410
girlfriend.

30:28.411 --> 30:29.989
We get along great.

30:29.990 --> 30:34.989
I feel like I had some
doubts in him especially

30:34.990 --> 30:37.989
after what zing bot said but
I know he really takes me

30:37.990 --> 30:37.991
seriously.

30:37.991 --> 30:42.989
He just asked me to be his
gf officially on national

30:42.990 --> 30:43.990
television.

30:43.991 --> 30:46.409
But he can't have two
girlfriends so he better

30:46.410 --> 30:48.989
break up with that other
grirl friend when he gets

30:48.990 --> 30:51.949
out.

30:51.950 --> 30:59.950
Hashtag Liz...
>> you can be my bae.

31:07.990 --> 31:08.990
>.

31:08.991 --> 31:14.949
I have been the victim of
many of James's scares.

31:14.950 --> 31:17.999
It is extremely hard to
prank James so next best

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
thing, Austin.

31:19.001 --> 31:22.989
I want to hear him scream
like a girl.

31:22.990 --> 31:23.950
Protein time.

31:23.951 --> 31:31.951
A little protein before
bed never hurt anyone.

31:32.990 --> 31:33.990
Okay.

31:33.991 --> 31:35.989
What the hell is going on
in here.

31:35.990 --> 31:36.120
Nothing.

31:36.121 --> 31:39.989
We're trying to go to sleep.

31:39.990 --> 31:41.949
What is she doing now.

31:41.950 --> 31:43.989
She's in the bathroom.

31:43.990 --> 31:44.990
Can you turn the light off?

31:44.991 --> 31:45.999
I can.

31:46.000 --> 31:54.000
Nighty night.

32:03.990 --> 32:05.989
> Jeez!

32:05.990 --> 32:09.989
What was that?

32:09.990 --> 32:16.989
What the... we got you.

32:16.990 --> 32:19.119
Scaring Austin is way too easy.

32:19.120 --> 32:22.989
You got to sleep with one
eye open, James, because I'm

32:22.990 --> 32:26.989
coming after you.

32:26.990 --> 32:34.989
We scared Austin, yeah!

32:34.990 --> 32:35.990
Hey!

32:35.991 --> 32:36.999
Come on in.

32:37.000 --> 32:37.990
How are you guys.

32:37.990 --> 32:38.990
Good, how are you?

32:38.991 --> 32:40.949
Good.

32:40.950 --> 32:44.989
I want so badly to trust
Austin but I do have this

32:44.990 --> 32:47.699
doubt that maybe he hasn't
been to the allly

32:47.700 --> 32:50.409
straightforward with me and
if James and Meg have some

32:50.410 --> 32:52.989
information that indicates
that maybe Austin doesn't

32:52.990 --> 32:55.989
totally have my back, I'm
open minded to hear it out

32:55.990 --> 32:58.989
right now and maybe that
will change who my targets

32:58.990 --> 32:59.290
will be.

32:59.291 --> 33:00.999
So here's what I'm
struggling with at this

33:01.000 --> 33:01.990
point.

33:01.990 --> 33:02.990
Go for it.

33:02.991 --> 33:04.699
My mind is open to make
some big moves.

33:04.700 --> 33:05.989
Is there anything
information you have that

33:05.990 --> 33:08.989
you would like me to have
that would help me

33:08.990 --> 33:16.990
facilitate me knowing what
the best move is for my game?

33:18.990 --> 33:22.989
All right, changing gears,
essentially I feel like

33:22.990 --> 33:24.989
everyone in the house wanted
me out last week and so...

33:24.990 --> 33:25.990
last week?

33:25.990 --> 33:26.540
Yeah.

33:26.541 --> 33:27.989
I was the target.

33:27.990 --> 33:31.539
Everyone was under the
assumption I was the target.

33:31.540 --> 33:32.120
Like this past week.

33:32.120 --> 33:32.990
Yes.

33:32.990 --> 33:33.990
I was never filled in on that.

33:33.990 --> 33:34.990
Oh, really?

33:34.991 --> 33:36.989
No.

33:36.990 --> 33:39.989
Vanessa is trying very
hard to get information from

33:39.990 --> 33:42.989
me but I know that anything
said with her can come back

33:42.990 --> 33:46.989
and bite me in the butt so
I'm being very careful about

33:46.990 --> 33:47.990
what I'm saying.

33:47.991 --> 33:50.989
I just feel like I'm
forgetting conversations or

33:50.990 --> 33:53.699
being dumb but I really,
like, it's making me feel

33:53.700 --> 33:55.119
like we weren't in on that
at all.

33:55.120 --> 33:55.990
All right.

33:55.991 --> 33:58.989
Meg and James aren't
giving me any reason not to

33:58.990 --> 33:59.000
trust Austin.

33:59.001 --> 34:01.989
So I need to keep up the
charade that Johnnie mack is

34:01.990 --> 34:04.289
my target and I'm looking
for a pawn.

34:04.290 --> 34:06.989
I'm tring to figure out
how to make this work and

34:06.990 --> 34:10.119
get as little blood on my
hand as possible, with

34:10.120 --> 34:13.409
Johnnie mack, knowing Austin
and the twins are terrified

34:13.410 --> 34:13.990
of him.

34:13.991 --> 34:16.989
How do either of you feel
about being pawns?

34:16.990 --> 34:18.989
I mean, I'll be blunt with you.

34:18.990 --> 34:25.989
Like the two of us have been
on the block like a fricken

34:25.990 --> 34:26.990
lot, it sucks.

34:26.990 --> 34:27.990
Okay.

34:27.991 --> 34:30.409
Only thing I can say is
if you are going to put one

34:30.410 --> 34:32.989
person up from us two, I
would actually, I wouldn't

34:32.990 --> 34:34.989
mind going up.

34:34.990 --> 34:36.989
No.

34:36.990 --> 34:40.699
She's crazy, she's losing
her marbles.

34:40.700 --> 34:40.990
No.

34:40.991 --> 34:42.949
You can put me up before him.

34:42.950 --> 34:42.990
Meg, stop.

34:42.991 --> 34:47.699
No, but that's
like... don't even.

34:47.700 --> 34:48.700
It's okay.

34:48.701 --> 34:49.989
No.

34:49.990 --> 34:50.990
Please put me up before him.

34:50.990 --> 34:51.990
Meg, chill.

34:51.990 --> 34:52.990
No.

34:52.990 --> 34:53.990
But... dead serious, though.

34:53.991 --> 34:57.989
There is more of a shot of
me staying than him staying.

34:57.990 --> 35:00.989
Please don't put him up.

35:00.990 --> 35:03.989
To Meg starts crying says
no, put me newspaper front

35:03.990 --> 35:06.989
of James, and James saying
no, put me up in front of

35:06.990 --> 35:06.991
Meg.

35:06.991 --> 35:09.989
And I don't know if they
realize they are giving me

35:09.990 --> 35:12.989
more of a reason to target
themselves, but they are

35:12.990 --> 35:16.539
acting like a married couple
that will throw themselve os

35:16.540 --> 35:18.989
on the sword for each other.

35:18.990 --> 35:20.989
That is something in "big
brother", you have to break

35:20.990 --> 35:21.990
up.

35:21.991 --> 35:24.989
If you don't want to use
us a pawn f I won hoh there

35:24.990 --> 35:26.989
would be no front door, no
back door.

35:26.990 --> 35:28.989
You realize with who is
left in the game that means

35:28.990 --> 35:31.539
you have to put up one of
Austin and the twins.

35:31.540 --> 35:33.289
Yeah, you know I have no
problem with that.

35:33.290 --> 35:33.990
Okay.

35:33.991 --> 35:35.989
James felt comfortable
enough to tell me that he

35:35.990 --> 35:38.949
would be willing to put up
Austin and the twins next

35:38.950 --> 35:38.990
week.

35:38.991 --> 35:42.119
However, it don't give me
any information about why I

35:42.120 --> 35:44.989
should be willing to target
Austin and the twins.

35:44.990 --> 35:46.989
And without that, it means
they need to be my target

35:46.990 --> 35:47.990
this weak.

35:47.990 --> 35:48.990
Thank you for talking to us.

35:48.991 --> 35:52.989
I'm going to do just so
you know, I will do what is

35:52.990 --> 35:56.289
best for my game but I hear
you what want to happen.

35:56.290 --> 35:56.990
We got you.

35:56.991 --> 35:58.409
All right, you guys.

35:58.410 --> 35:59.989
All right.

35:59.990 --> 36:00.990
Thank you guys.

36:00.991 --> 36:08.989
For your time, all right, bye.

36:08.990 --> 36:11.989
I knew that was going to
get the tears flowing.

36:11.990 --> 36:12.950
I know.

36:12.951 --> 36:13.989
You can't do that.

36:13.990 --> 36:13.991
Why?

36:13.991 --> 36:20.989
I am feeling good about
the conversation that we had

36:20.990 --> 36:21.990
with Vanessa.

36:21.991 --> 36:24.989
I definitely feel like
there's bigger targets in

36:24.990 --> 36:25.990
the house that she can go after.

36:25.991 --> 36:29.989
So right now we're hoping
that Vanessa does not put me

36:29.990 --> 36:31.119
or Meg up.

36:31.120 --> 36:32.989
What do you think she's
going to do?

36:32.990 --> 36:36.989
I will be very shocked if
she throws up on the block.

36:36.990 --> 36:36.991
Really?

36:36.991 --> 36:39.989
Yeah.

36:39.990 --> 36:43.989
Vanessa is about pulling
arm strings... and I did that

36:43.990 --> 36:44.990
act of kindness.

36:44.991 --> 36:46.699
And I put it back to you.

36:46.700 --> 36:48.989
And she was like oh my God.

36:48.990 --> 36:52.989
Just like y'all are nuts.

36:52.990 --> 36:57.989
And the thing is, we are
thinking Vanessa is close

36:57.990 --> 37:00.989
with Austin but I don't
think Vanessa is as close as

37:00.990 --> 37:00.991
we think.

37:00.991 --> 37:02.989
I think she's kind of rogue.

37:02.990 --> 37:05.989
She's like I've got to do
what is best for my game.

37:05.990 --> 37:08.989
She already knows both of us,
we do what we got to do.

37:08.990 --> 37:10.409
I told her straight up.

37:10.410 --> 37:14.409
I will throw Austin's ass up
on that block.

37:14.410 --> 37:14.990
I would too.

37:14.990 --> 37:15.990
I don't care.

37:15.990 --> 37:16.990
I know would you too.

37:16.991 --> 37:18.989
That's why she's going to
keep us.

37:18.990 --> 37:21.409
Yeah.

37:21.410 --> 37:24.989
We will do the dirty work,
which I don't care.

37:24.990 --> 37:25.990
God.

37:25.991 --> 37:27.989
We're fighting for our
lives right now.

37:27.990 --> 37:29.289
We're the underdogs.

37:29.290 --> 37:31.989
Vanessa has to understand
she knows she's an underdog

37:31.990 --> 37:31.991
too.

37:31.991 --> 37:33.989
She is the lowest underdog.

37:33.990 --> 37:35.989
She is only one person.

37:35.990 --> 37:36.990
I know.

37:36.991 --> 37:37.999
Oh my God.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.989
This game is never going to end.

37:40.990 --> 37:42.990
Welcome to "Big Brother"

37:59.990 --> 38:03.989
extra dots!

38:03.990 --> 38:06.989
Wloe, wait a minute.

38:06.990 --> 38:11.989
Didn't Vanessa... when I was
hoh and she came up to the

38:11.990 --> 38:15.949
room, she was like if you
don't put me up and whenever

38:15.950 --> 38:18.989
I'm hoh, you will be safe
and one other person.

38:18.990 --> 38:20.989
That was one of her deals.

38:20.990 --> 38:21.990
Yeah.

38:21.991 --> 38:24.989
It is a deal, I could
offer, if you don't put me

38:24.990 --> 38:30.989
up, if I'm hoh before final
seven, you can also exclude

38:30.990 --> 38:34.989
one person from being put up
on the block by me in

38:34.990 --> 38:36.949
addition to yourself.

38:36.950 --> 38:37.989
It is a good deal.

38:37.990 --> 38:38.990
That's a deal right.

38:38.991 --> 38:41.989
Think I should go tell her,
bring it up?

38:41.990 --> 38:43.989
Just go hey, that deal.

38:43.990 --> 38:46.989
I don't know.

38:46.990 --> 38:49.989
One thing is I don't want
to confront her if she's not

38:49.990 --> 38:51.409
putting us up.

38:51.410 --> 38:52.699
I know.

38:52.700 --> 38:55.989
The whole time she might be
putting Steve and Johnnie

38:55.990 --> 38:56.990
mack up.

38:56.991 --> 39:00.989
And then we kind of piss
her off because we're like

39:00.990 --> 39:01.990
what about the deal, what
about the deal.

39:01.991 --> 39:04.409
Like it's we don't trust her
or something.

39:04.410 --> 39:04.990
I don't know.

39:04.991 --> 39:09.829
But if she is, I'm putting
James up, then it's like,

39:09.830 --> 39:10.989
whoa, wait, wait a minute.

39:10.990 --> 39:12.989
You know, we had a deal.

39:12.990 --> 39:17.989
If we go up as pawns, it
just means like we're less

39:17.990 --> 39:19.289
likely to go up next week.

39:19.290 --> 39:27.290
If we can make it through
this week than we'll be

39:34.990 --> 39:35.990
fine.

39:35.991 --> 39:37.989
My responsibility as the
head of house old is to

39:37.990 --> 39:43.989
nominate two people for
eviction.

39:43.990 --> 39:45.989
Going into the nomination
ceremony, you know this is

39:45.990 --> 39:49.989
one of the weeks that I
really don't know if the

39:49.990 --> 39:52.989
hands up Ted toss, I just
hope that possibly me and

39:52.990 --> 39:59.989
Meg will be safe this week.

39:59.990 --> 40:03.989
From evicted to back in
the game but this week with

40:03.990 --> 40:07.119
Vanessa in charge I'm pretty
confident I'm not getting no

40:07.120 --> 40:07.990
natured.

40:07.991 --> 40:13.409
It's crazy how this game can
change on a dime.

40:13.410 --> 40:14.989
I'm feeling presentee
good about our conversation

40:14.990 --> 40:15.990
with Vanessa.

40:15.991 --> 40:18.989
There's a possibility that
one of us is going up as a

40:18.990 --> 40:21.989
pawn but there is still
seems to be a bigger threat

40:21.990 --> 40:24.989
in the house.

40:24.990 --> 40:32.990
Hey, guys, it's time for
the nomination ceremony.

40:43.830 --> 40:44.989
Thises is the nomination
ceremony.

40:44.990 --> 40:47.989
It my responsibilitys ahead
of household to nominate two

40:47.990 --> 40:49.989
house guests for eviction.

40:49.990 --> 40:52.989
I will turn two keys to lock
in my nomination and the

40:52.990 --> 40:55.699
faces will appear on the
memory wall.

40:55.700 --> 41:03.700
The first house guest I've
nominateed is...

41:09.990 --> 41:17.990
The next house guest I've
nominated is:.

41:25.990 --> 41:29.119
I have nominated you, Meg,
and you James.

41:29.120 --> 41:32.989
This could be farther from
personal it is a game move f

41:32.990 --> 41:35.699
nothing else t is a chest
move and unfortunately for

41:35.700 --> 41:37.989
you guys it's my move now.

41:37.990 --> 41:40.989
And if anyone has played
chess with me they know I

41:40.990 --> 41:44.989
won't hesitate to put a king
in check and a king isn't

41:44.990 --> 41:45.990
worth much without his queen.

41:45.991 --> 41:49.989
This nomination ceremony is
add journd.

41:49.990 --> 41:54.989
I am feeling superplayed
in this game right now.

41:54.990 --> 41:57.949
James is the only person
that has my back.

41:57.950 --> 42:00.539
And I'm now facing the
reality that I'm either

42:00.540 --> 42:04.989
going to be going home most
likely or I'm going to be

42:04.990 --> 42:09.989
staying in the house without
James and my game is falling

42:09.990 --> 42:13.989
part.

42:13.990 --> 42:15.989
Meg and James are getting
exactly what they deserve.

42:15.990 --> 42:17.989
I felt strongly that I could
trust them.

42:17.990 --> 42:22.409
Until I found out that they
were ready to take me out.

42:22.410 --> 42:24.999
Story but Vanessa got to you
first.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.989
By creating a side
alliance with Johnnie mack

42:27.990 --> 42:29.989
and Steve I'm redrawn
drawing the lines in the

42:29.990 --> 42:32.989
house that put me in a much
more favorable position

42:32.990 --> 42:35.989
coming out of this week than
I was coming in.

42:35.990 --> 42:37.989
I'm sorry James and Meg.

42:37.990 --> 42:40.989
I kind of regret not
telling Vanessa about the

42:40.990 --> 42:41.990
deal that we made.

42:41.991 --> 42:44.989
But then again, it's like,
you are darned if you do and

42:44.990 --> 42:45.990
you're darned if you don't.

42:45.991 --> 42:48.989
I am definitely looking
forward to veto competition

42:48.990 --> 42:50.989
and I'm definitely going to
fight my way to try to win

42:50.990 --> 42:52.989
that power of veto.

42:52.990 --> 42:55.989
Who will win the power of veto.

42:55.990 --> 42:58.989
And will it be used to save
either James or Meg from

42:58.990 --> 42:59.990
eviction?

42:59.991 --> 43:02.540
