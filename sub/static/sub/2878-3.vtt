WEBVTT

00:02.695 --> 00:04.011
Who wants the
last dumpling?

00:04.011 --> 00:05.362
Ooh, me!

00:05.364 --> 00:06.730
Penny, a moment.

00:06.732 --> 00:08.815
We just had Thai food.

00:08.817 --> 00:11.735
In that culture,
the last morsel is called

00:11.737 --> 00:14.905
the "greng jie" piece,
and it is reserved for

00:14.907 --> 00:18.041
the most important
and valued member of the group.

00:23.398 --> 00:27.050
Thank you all
for this high honor.

00:28.269 --> 00:31.922
I've seen pictures
of your mother; keep eating.

00:36.344 --> 00:39.846
All right, honey, if we're gonna
make the movie, we should go.

00:43.184 --> 00:45.435
This may be hard
for you to hear,

00:45.437 --> 00:48.522
but when I say "honey,"
I mean my fiancée.

00:50.358 --> 00:53.360
Yeah, well, now it means her.

00:55.113 --> 00:57.080
It's okay if he
wants to come.

00:57.082 --> 00:59.699
Fine. But next time,
we get a sitter.

01:01.285 --> 01:03.253
All right, I got to go to work.
I'll walk down with you.

01:03.255 --> 01:04.504
Wait.

01:04.506 --> 01:07.407
Which is closer to the new
train store in Monrovia,

01:07.409 --> 01:09.593
the movie theater
or The Cheesecake Factory?

01:09.595 --> 01:11.678
Neither of them are close.

01:11.680 --> 01:13.680
Oh, well, then I guess
it doesn't matter which one

01:13.682 --> 01:14.598
of you drives me.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.049
Let's play a fun guessing game

01:16.051 --> 01:17.767
to see who gets to take me.

01:17.769 --> 01:21.138
All right, this four-letter word
describes either

01:21.140 --> 01:25.058
a printer's type size
or a compulsion to eat dirt.

01:25.060 --> 01:26.810
Okay, I'm not driving him.

01:26.812 --> 01:29.229
Penny, don't give up,
you can get this.

01:32.316 --> 01:34.951
Aren't you going
with Sheldon?

01:34.953 --> 01:38.238
No, I have no interest
in model trains,

01:38.240 --> 01:41.992
stores that sell them, nor
their heartbreaking clientele.

01:41.994 --> 01:43.210
Oh.

01:43.212 --> 01:46.413
Well, I have
some work to do, so...

01:46.415 --> 01:48.181
I can't imagine
that would disturb me.

01:48.183 --> 01:49.483
Carry on.

01:49.485 --> 01:52.886
Okay.

01:52.888 --> 01:55.138
Wouldn't you be
more comfortable at home?

01:59.060 --> 02:01.228
Not really, no.

02:01.230 --> 02:03.430
All righty then.

02:03.432 --> 02:05.649
Guess I'll just
get started.

02:05.651 --> 02:08.068
Leonard, please. I don't need
the running commentary.

02:50.547 --> 02:52.197
(sighs softly)

02:54.634 --> 02:56.317
- Amy?
- Yo.

02:57.892 --> 02:58.670
You okay?

02:58.671 --> 03:00.571
Oh, sure.

03:01.372 --> 03:03.507
I thought you were reading.

03:03.509 --> 03:05.425
I was.

03:05.427 --> 03:08.178
Now I'm thinking about
what I read.

03:20.308 --> 03:21.708
You all right, Leonard?

03:21.710 --> 03:24.027
You seem very uncomfortable.

03:24.029 --> 03:27.114
I-I'm fine.

03:27.116 --> 03:29.032
Should I go?

03:29.034 --> 03:31.451
I've been told sometimes
I overstay my welcome.

03:31.453 --> 03:34.638
Wha... who told you that?

03:34.640 --> 03:39.042
Well, most recently
my gynecologist.

03:43.965 --> 03:46.783
Well, you stay
as long as you'd like.

03:46.785 --> 03:48.335
I'm glad to hear you say that,

03:48.337 --> 03:51.388
because I'm having
a wonderful time.

03:51.390 --> 03:52.472
(chuckles)

03:52.474 --> 03:56.226
I said the same thing
to my gynecologist.

04:00.064 --> 04:02.983
What are you going to get
at the train store, Sheldon?

04:02.985 --> 04:04.935
Oh, I'm not
buying anything.

04:04.937 --> 04:06.970
They're having a lecture.

04:06.972 --> 04:09.072
"H-O gauge railroading.

04:09.074 --> 04:12.692
Half the size of O-gauge,
but twice the fun."

04:12.694 --> 04:16.079
Very controversial topic.

04:16.081 --> 04:17.981
Which side do you come down on?

04:17.983 --> 04:20.083
I'll let you know after tonight.

04:20.084 --> 04:22.786
Unlike some people,
I'm going in with an open mind.

04:22.788 --> 04:24.671
Who am I kidding?

04:24.673 --> 04:27.824
Of course we all know
it's O-gauge or no gauge.

04:27.826 --> 04:32.012
Can you believe grown men sit
around and play with toy trains?

04:32.014 --> 04:34.264
That's pretty big talk
for a man

04:34.266 --> 04:37.517
with a closet full of magic
tricks at his mother's house.

04:39.220 --> 04:41.555
First of all, they're not
tricks, they're illusions.

04:41.557 --> 04:43.723
And...

04:43.725 --> 04:46.276
secondly, when we get
married, they're all going up

04:46.278 --> 04:49.112
in the attic so you can have
that closet for clothes.

04:49.114 --> 04:52.032
Why would I keep clothes
at your mother's house?

04:52.034 --> 04:53.700
Well, don't think
of it that way.

04:53.702 --> 04:55.852
Once we move in,
it'll be our house.

04:55.854 --> 04:57.320
Is she moving out?

04:57.322 --> 04:58.688
Why would
she move out?

04:58.690 --> 05:00.457
It's her house.

05:00.459 --> 05:02.859
Hang on.

05:02.861 --> 05:06.046
You seriously think I'm going
to live with your mother?

05:06.048 --> 05:07.664
Howard, I think
I can help here.

05:07.666 --> 05:10.300
Yes, Bernadette,
that's exactly what he thinks.

05:10.302 --> 05:11.418
Why not?

05:11.420 --> 05:13.503
It's a great house,
plenty of room,

05:13.505 --> 05:15.589
and if we have kids,
Mom's there to help.

05:15.591 --> 05:17.474
You know, en she tells "The
Three Little Pigs" story,

05:17.476 --> 05:21.261
she actually has hair
on her chinny-chin-chin.

05:21.263 --> 05:23.763
I'm not gonna live
with your mother.

05:23.765 --> 05:26.549
Not now, not ever.

05:26.551 --> 05:30.237
Wow, someone obviously
has some mommy issues.

05:32.273 --> 05:33.890
Raj, take me home.

05:33.892 --> 05:36.326
Don't listen to her.
Go to the movie theater.

05:36.328 --> 05:37.694
Take me home now.

05:37.696 --> 05:38.662
Movie theater!

05:38.664 --> 05:39.663
(groans)

05:39.665 --> 05:42.198
Okay, everybody
calm down.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.867
There is a simple
solution here.

05:43.869 --> 05:45.452
Raj, take me to the train store,

05:45.454 --> 05:47.754
and then I don't care
what you people do.

05:55.046 --> 05:56.713
How was your shower?

05:56.715 --> 06:00.083
It was good, good.

06:00.085 --> 06:03.353
Just out of curiosity, what time
do you usually go to bed?

06:03.355 --> 06:04.688
Oh, I'm up all night.

06:04.690 --> 06:06.439
I'm like a possum.

06:08.359 --> 06:11.161
Boy, you were not liked
in high school, were you?

06:11.163 --> 06:12.679
Not really.

06:12.681 --> 06:14.531
- Is that my yearbook?
- Mm-hmm.

06:14.533 --> 06:16.700
"Dear Leonard,
you're really good at science.

06:16.702 --> 06:20.403
Maybe one day you'll come up
with a cure for being a dork."

06:20.405 --> 06:22.906
Well, it wasn't spray-painting
a lightning bolt

06:22.908 --> 06:26.042
on my briefcase,
I can tell you that.

06:26.044 --> 06:27.460
If it makes you feel any better,

06:27.462 --> 06:29.713
the only person who signed
my yearbook was my mother.

06:29.715 --> 06:31.648
- Aw.
- "Dear Amy,

06:31.650 --> 06:34.250
"Self-respect and a hymen
are better than friends and fun.

06:34.252 --> 06:35.585
Love, Mom."

06:37.221 --> 06:39.956
Well, you can add
Jerry's Junction

06:39.958 --> 06:41.558
to the list of train stores

06:41.560 --> 06:44.961
Sheldon Cooper will never
set foot in again.

06:44.963 --> 06:47.580
Rough night, Casey Jones?

06:47.582 --> 06:49.349
You don't know
the half of it.

06:49.351 --> 06:50.734
It was billed

06:50.736 --> 06:53.687
as a lively give-and-take on
the merits of model train sizes.

06:53.689 --> 06:56.239
But it was actually a setup
to intimidate

06:56.241 --> 06:59.826
weak-minded spineless rubes
into buying H-O starter sets.

06:59.828 --> 07:00.944
What's in the bag?

07:00.946 --> 07:04.364
I don't want to talk about it.

07:04.366 --> 07:07.250
But it's not a spine,
I'll tell you that.

07:07.252 --> 07:09.919
Well, I had a delightful
evening, Leonard.

07:09.921 --> 07:11.254
We should do this
again sometime.

07:11.256 --> 07:13.289
Ah, sure.
That'd be nice.

07:13.291 --> 07:14.374
Glad to hear it.

07:14.376 --> 07:16.159
I need someone to accompany me
to the wedding

07:16.161 --> 07:18.378
of Dr. Moranelli
and Dr. Gustufson this Friday.

07:18.380 --> 07:20.013
They're kind of
the Brad and Angelina

07:20.015 --> 07:21.998
of the primatology department.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.433
Wouldn't you rather
bring Sheldon?

07:23.435 --> 07:26.920
I would, but the last wedding
we went to was a disaster.

07:26.922 --> 07:29.356
He behaved like a child
the entire time.

07:29.358 --> 07:30.690
Not my fault.

07:30.692 --> 07:33.943
You said there'd be
other scientists there my age.

07:37.698 --> 07:39.282
Doesn't matter.
You're out, he's in.

07:39.284 --> 07:41.735
No date to the prom,
two dates to a wedding.

07:41.737 --> 07:44.821
Hmm, how times change.

07:47.792 --> 07:50.827
(singsongy): Ha-ha, you have
to go to a wedding.

07:54.298 --> 07:55.865
(doorbell rings)

07:55.867 --> 07:56.866
WOLOWITZ:
I'll get it!

07:56.868 --> 07:58.034
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Could you get it?!

07:58.036 --> 07:59.469
I just said
I'm getting it!

07:59.471 --> 08:00.870
Fine, I'll get it!

08:00.872 --> 08:03.506
I got it!

08:04.341 --> 08:06.092
Oh, hi.

08:06.094 --> 08:07.343
Hey.

08:07.345 --> 08:08.812
I don't want to fight.

08:08.814 --> 08:10.930
I was just surprised
when you sprung

08:10.932 --> 08:12.816
the whole living-with-your-mom
stuff on me.

08:12.818 --> 08:17.237
Yeah, well, I'm sorry I
didn't run it by you first.

08:17.239 --> 08:19.355
MRS. WOLOWITZ: I don't know who
you're talking to,

08:19.357 --> 08:20.390
but in or out!

08:20.392 --> 08:23.460
We don't need bugs!

08:23.462 --> 08:25.662
The bugs
only come here

08:25.664 --> 08:27.864
because you're
their queen!

08:30.618 --> 08:32.919
Listen, how about this.

08:32.921 --> 08:34.837
Before we make any
kind of decision

08:34.840 --> 08:37.173
about where we live,
we have a trial run.

08:37.174 --> 08:39.174
Stay here for a weekend,
see what it's like.

08:39.177 --> 08:41.177
And your mom would be
okay with that?

08:41.179 --> 08:42.462
Sure she would.

08:42.464 --> 08:45.081
Ma, do you mind if Bernadette
stays here this weekend?!

08:45.083 --> 08:47.801
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Hey, if she's willing to
give the milk away for free,

08:47.803 --> 08:49.969
who am I to say no?!

08:52.223 --> 08:55.058
See? She's
good with it.

08:55.060 --> 08:57.593
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Frankly, after all
your sleepovers

08:57.595 --> 09:01.481
with the little brown boy,
a girl is a big relief!

09:13.615 --> 09:16.818
All these years,
I've been so wrong.

09:16.820 --> 09:20.855
The tinier the train,
the more concentrated the fun.

09:24.860 --> 09:26.627
You're a brain scientist.

09:26.629 --> 09:28.696
Can you explain to me
why a brilliant man

09:28.698 --> 09:30.030
likes playing
with toy trains?

09:30.032 --> 09:32.717
Not without cutting
his head open, no.

09:34.219 --> 09:36.637
How about making my
eyes like Cleopatra?

09:36.639 --> 09:38.589
Really? For a wedding?

09:38.591 --> 09:39.924
Perhaps you're right.

09:39.926 --> 09:41.542
My cheekbones and
beckoning pelvis

09:41.544 --> 09:44.178
already have a certain "hello
sailor" quality to them.

09:45.180 --> 09:47.064
Ready.

09:47.066 --> 09:49.567
Aw.

09:49.569 --> 09:51.352
So handsome.

09:51.354 --> 09:53.487
Like James Bond.

09:53.489 --> 09:57.491
He's better than James Bond,
because he's tinier.

09:58.277 --> 10:00.845
I got you this
to give to me.

10:00.847 --> 10:04.081
Oh, sweetie,
guests don't normally

10:04.083 --> 10:05.583
wear corsages to a wedding.

10:05.585 --> 10:07.118
That's more of a prom thing.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.336
I never went to my prom.

10:08.338 --> 10:10.087
My mom paid my cousin
to take me,

10:10.089 --> 10:13.174
but he just used the money
to buy drugs.

10:13.176 --> 10:15.793
Put the corsage on her.

10:21.416 --> 10:24.936
When you're done copping a
feel, that goes on my wrist.

10:28.089 --> 10:29.624
(high-pitched):
All aboard!

10:29.626 --> 10:32.276
Woo-woo!

10:32.278 --> 10:33.978
(normal voice):
It's official.

10:33.980 --> 10:36.364
I'm an H-O trainiac.

10:39.434 --> 10:42.436
So, dinner
went nice.

10:42.438 --> 10:44.288
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

10:44.290 --> 10:49.076
Does your mother always
cut your meat for you?

10:49.078 --> 10:52.413
Only when it's fatty.

10:53.749 --> 10:55.333
Well, don't be jealous, babe.

10:55.335 --> 10:57.718
Someday you'll get to cut it
for me.

10:57.720 --> 10:59.720
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Bernadette!

10:59.722 --> 11:03.557
I found the extra head for the
Waterpik if you want to use it!

11:03.559 --> 11:05.893
I'm okay, Mrs. Wolowitz.

11:05.895 --> 11:07.127

Hey, Ma, how about
a little privacy?!

Oh, I know what that means!

Hubba-hubba!

11:17.607 --> 11:19.807
Oh, God.

11:19.809 --> 11:21.943
Relax, it'll be fine.

11:21.945 --> 11:23.577
Okay.

No, thank you.

I'm really not
much of a dancer.

11:51.473 --> 11:53.474
You're not exactly
winning any trophies

Why shouldn't they be?

They have a feverish night of

12:05.121 --> 12:07.238
socially-approved
copulation ahead of them.

12:09.324 --> 12:11.575
In some cultures, we'd stand
outside of their bedroom

12:11.577 --> 12:13.544
cheering as they
achieved orgasm.

12:13.546 --> 12:15.863
That sounds like
a late night,

Leonard, you may
not have noticed,

12:21.037 --> 12:23.504

a delight here.

your end of the evening.

Oh, sorry. This wedding
just reminds me

12:29.645 --> 12:33.264
of my kinda-sorta girlfriend
9,000 miles away.

12:33.266 --> 12:36.050
I have a kinda-sorta boyfriend
who's playing with a model train

right now, you don't hear me
bitching about it.

12:42.324 --> 12:44.391
Leonard, a word of advice--
moody self-obsession

12:44.393 --> 12:46.777
is only attractive in men
who can play guitar

12:46.779 --> 12:49.113
and are considerably
taller than you.

12:49.115 --> 12:50.815
I'm not moody.

12:50.817 --> 12:52.083
I'm fun.

12:52.085 --> 12:55.002
You have any evidence
to support that statement?

Well, hey, I'm just as
much fun as you are.

12:57.840 --> 13:00.758
Really? Are you willing to draw
a mustache on your finger

13:00.760 --> 13:03.427
as a conversational icebreaker?

13:03.429 --> 13:06.380
I am.

You're welcome.

15:36.899 --> 15:38.999
And also for breaking
the head off the ice swan

my pulled groin.

15:40.920 --> 15:42.620

15:42.622 --> 15:45.572

a hunch that the graceful slope

your genitals nicely.

Great. Until I accidentally made
Leonard fall in love with me.

glass of wine?

Wine is one of the reasons
I'm in this fix.

16:28.551 --> 16:30.000
That and this dang pelvis.

16:32.170 --> 16:34.822
Okay, I'm sorry,
what exactly happened?

16:34.824 --> 16:37.074
The inevitable--
he was lonely and vulnerable

16:37.076 --> 16:38.575
from missing his girlfriend,

16:38.577 --> 16:39.793
while I was charming,

16:39.795 --> 16:41.862
supportive and,
let's face it, in this dress,

16:41.864 --> 16:45.499
the perfect combination
of Madonna and whore.

16:45.501 --> 16:48.252
Oh, God,
did he make a move on you?

16:48.254 --> 16:50.037
No, but it's only
a matter of time.

16:50.039 --> 16:52.723
How could I have not
seen this coming?

16:52.725 --> 16:56.844
Now I'm gonna have to break
the little sad sack's heart.

16:56.846 --> 16:59.596
- Yeah, I'm sure he'll be okay.
- Oh, Penny,

16:59.598 --> 17:02.483
much as I would treasure
knowing that the two of us had

17:02.485 --> 17:04.151
been defiled by the same man,

17:04.153 --> 17:06.153
Leonard just doesn't get
my motor running.

17:09.858 --> 17:11.492
So, um, what are
you gonna do?

17:11.493 --> 17:14.411
Do you want me to talk
to Leonard, let him down easy?

17:14.413 --> 17:16.780
No. I'll let him have tonight.

17:16.781 --> 17:17.865
Then in the morning,

17:17.867 --> 17:19.666
I'll send him an e-mail
letting him know

17:19.669 --> 17:22.252
this body is never
gonna be his wonderland.

17:23.755 --> 17:26.906
I mean, frankly, you've got
a better shot than he does.

17:36.768 --> 17:38.085
Leonard.

17:38.087 --> 17:39.553
Check it out.

17:39.555 --> 17:41.755
I bought an N-gauge locomotive.

17:41.757 --> 17:43.857
Half the size of H-O.

17:43.859 --> 17:47.361
Look, it fits in my mouth.

17:47.363 --> 17:49.697
Sounds like you
had a <i>great</i> night.

17:49.699 --> 17:51.765
(muffled):
I did.

17:51.767 --> 17:54.702
- How was yours?
- Not bad. I had a lot more fun

17:54.704 --> 17:56.436
with Amy than I
thought I would.

17:56.438 --> 17:58.822
What exact
do you mean by that?

17:58.824 --> 18:00.407
Well, it turns out
she really knows

18:00.409 --> 18:03.160
how to help a guy loosen up
and have a good time.

18:03.162 --> 18:07.164
Although, truth be told, my
groin's a little worse for wear.

18:07.999 --> 18:10.300
Ow!

18:11.970 --> 18:13.887
Why did you do that?

18:13.889 --> 18:17.391
To send a message:
she is not for you.

18:17.393 --> 18:18.792
What?

18:18.794 --> 18:20.144
Not for you!

18:32.830 --> 18:35.515
Good morning, handsome.

18:35.517 --> 18:38.334
Morning, Mom.

18:39.637 --> 18:41.521
It's me.

18:43.641 --> 18:47.343
Yes, it is, and you're
so pretty in the morning.

18:48.946 --> 18:51.014
Your mom and I
made you breakfast.

18:51.016 --> 18:52.399
(laughs)
Oh, wow.

18:52.401 --> 18:54.618
So you guys are getting along?

18:54.620 --> 18:56.236
Yeah, I guess.

18:56.238 --> 18:58.021
We're very different
people, Howard,

18:58.023 --> 19:00.857
so communication's
a little tricky.

19:00.859 --> 19:02.743
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Does he like the pancakes?!

19:02.745 --> 19:05.045
He didn't try them yet!

19:07.415 --> 19:09.199
Is there any butter?

19:09.201 --> 19:11.218
- It's butter-flavored syrup.
- Oh.

So, what's the word?!

19:12.888 --> 19:15.138
He wants butter!

19:16.441 --> 19:18.675
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
It's butter-flavored syrup!

19:18.677 --> 19:21.344
I just told him that!

19:26.717 --> 19:28.685
I don't need any butter.

19:28.687 --> 19:32.105
If you want butter,
I'll get you butter.

19:35.610 --> 19:37.527
Well, I guess
I'll cut these by myself.
