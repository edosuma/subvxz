00:13.999 --> 00:14.999
- Previously on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

00:14.999 --> 00:16.999
- It's not just about
getting the sangria

00:17.000 --> 00:18.999
at the bar
and at the restaurant.

00:18.999 --> 00:20.999
It's about getting it
into people's hands.

00:20.999 --> 00:23.999
- Put together a little plan
and bring it back to me.

00:23.999 --> 00:24.999
- Are you moving in?

00:24.999 --> 00:26.999
- Do you have a set of spare keys?
- Oh, my God.

00:26.999 --> 00:27.999
I told you you were
gonna get grilled.

00:27.999 --> 00:28.999
- Has he asked you to
have his babies yet?

00:28.999 --> 00:30.999
- Just nice to meet
somebody that's--

00:30.999 --> 00:34.999
I don't want to say "clueless" but
has no, really, idea about my past.

00:34.999 --> 00:35.999
- I was so good to you.

00:35.999 --> 00:38.999
- You have played me
for too long, and I'm done.

00:38.999 --> 00:39.999
- You've been eyeing up Lala,

00:39.999 --> 00:41.999
and suddenly a little
100-pound pipsqueak

00:41.999 --> 00:43.999
has come in
and stolen your thunder--

00:43.999 --> 00:44.999
- He's definitely getting
in my way a little bit.

00:44.999 --> 00:45.999
I'm not gonna lie.

00:45.999 --> 00:48.999
- Turn around for me.

00:48.999 --> 00:50.999
What is that?

00:50.999 --> 00:51.999
- I slept with someone
last night.

00:51.999 --> 00:52.999
- Usually I meet a girl;

00:52.999 --> 00:54.999
within ten minutes,
she's my girlfriend.

00:54.999 --> 00:56.999
- You and I would
definitely click.

00:56.999 --> 00:59.999
- She's young. She's blonde.
She's trouble.

01:30.999 --> 01:32.999
- Ken, this is Arielle.

01:32.999 --> 01:34.999
- Hey, Arielle.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

01:34.999 --> 01:36.999
- And you.
- Please sit down here.

01:36.999 --> 01:38.999
- Thank you.
- Sorry, I haven't got a voice.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.999
I've been shouting
at Gay Pride all weekend.

01:42.999 --> 01:46.999
So I saw your post on Facebook,
but tell me; I'm all ears.

01:46.999 --> 01:48.999
- So I volunteer
with homeless teens.

01:48.999 --> 01:50.999
- Right.
- And every month, I kind of

01:50.999 --> 01:52.999
ask them, "What do you want?
What do you need?"

01:52.999 --> 01:54.999
And they were telling me
that they had never been

01:54.999 --> 01:55.999
to a restaurant,
and I said,

01:55.999 --> 01:57.999
"Okay, I'm gonna
make that happen.

01:57.999 --> 01:58.999
I don't know how.
I'm gonna make that happen."

01:58.999 --> 01:59.999
- Who do you work with?

01:59.999 --> 02:01.999
- I pay for all
the support groups myself.

02:01.999 --> 02:03.999
- How do you do it
yourself, just...

02:03.999 --> 02:04.999
- So I work full-time
at a film studio,

02:04.999 --> 02:06.999
and then I work four nights
a week at a restaurant.

02:06.999 --> 02:08.999
So my full-time job
pays for my bills,

02:08.999 --> 02:11.999
and my nighttime job
pays for my passion.

02:11.999 --> 02:14.999
- We are approached by
so many different charities

02:14.999 --> 02:17.999
all the time, and it's very
important to me to support them.

02:17.999 --> 02:20.999
I love this.
We'll do whatever we can.

02:20.999 --> 02:23.999
- Well, thank you.
- How many kids?

02:23.999 --> 02:25.999
- I believe it's 12.
- We can do more.

02:25.999 --> 02:28.999
I just love this woman,
and I think my staff

02:28.999 --> 02:30.999
could really take a page
out of her book.

02:30.999 --> 02:32.999
She's spending the time
worrying about others

02:32.999 --> 02:34.999
rather than worrying about
herself.

02:34.999 --> 02:36.999
Keep your tips.
- Thank you.

02:36.999 --> 02:37.999
- That's fine.
No, we can do that.

02:37.999 --> 02:39.999
- Thank you.
- We're happy to do that.

02:39.999 --> 02:40.999
We'll, like, you know,
have it--

02:40.999 --> 02:41.999
- Make a fuss of them.

02:41.999 --> 02:43.999
- A great--yeah,
a great dining experience.

02:43.999 --> 02:46.999
- They're gonna be
so excited.

02:51.999 --> 02:54.999
- I gotta be honest--I don't
like your hair right now.

02:54.999 --> 02:56.999
- What? Why?
- Man.

02:56.999 --> 02:58.999
I just don't like it.
- Dude, you better be kidding.

02:58.999 --> 03:00.999
Look at this perm.

03:00.999 --> 03:01.999
I think it's synced
with my emotions,

03:01.999 --> 03:03.999
so, like, when I'm in
a good mood, it has more zest.

03:03.999 --> 03:04.999
- Well,
I'm really glad that

03:04.999 --> 03:06.999
that was representative
of, like,

03:06.999 --> 03:07.999
your commitment to our
relationship...

03:07.999 --> 03:08.999
- I know.

03:08.999 --> 03:11.999
- Because it went flat
immediately.

03:11.999 --> 03:13.999
- Of course it's not
styled fully yet.

03:13.999 --> 03:15.999
- Yeah, take it in.

03:15.999 --> 03:16.999
- Whoa.

03:16.999 --> 03:17.999
- Let's not talk about
the perm anymore.

03:17.999 --> 03:18.999
I'm sorry I brought it up.

03:18.999 --> 03:23.999
So tomorrow, game plan,
what is it?

03:23.999 --> 03:27.999
- I feel, at this point,
it would be non-beneficial

03:27.999 --> 03:31.999
for us to come
with too many specifics.

03:31.999 --> 03:33.999
The Lisa Vanderpump Sangria

03:33.999 --> 03:35.999
is actually run
by Pandora and Jason.

03:35.999 --> 03:36.999
- It's international now.

03:36.999 --> 03:37.999
If you're going
to approach this,

03:37.999 --> 03:38.999
you need to broaden
your horizons.

03:38.999 --> 03:40.999
This can't just be, like,

03:40.999 --> 03:41.999
"I'm going out to little

03:41.999 --> 03:43.999
clubs and pubs and bars
in St. Louis."

03:43.999 --> 03:47.999
- I'm a little intimidated,
but they do seem open

03:47.999 --> 03:49.999
to making something work.

03:49.999 --> 03:53.999
- I think we retracted somewhat
from our initial ambitions

03:53.999 --> 03:56.999
just because we didn't realize
what a big undertaking it is

03:56.999 --> 03:58.999
and what a time commitment
it would be.

03:58.999 --> 04:00.999
- Summers are also extremely
busy with, like,

04:00.999 --> 04:02.999
birthdays and trips
and stuff,

04:02.999 --> 04:03.999
and, you know,
taking this on--

04:03.999 --> 04:05.999
- So what, like, so you were

04:05.999 --> 04:07.999
expressing interest
and now you're not interested?

04:07.999 --> 04:08.999
- No, I'm still very--

04:08.999 --> 04:09.999
- She likes when you, like,

04:09.999 --> 04:10.999
just flake out on things.

04:10.999 --> 04:13.999
- Well, I mean, she knows
I have commitment issues.

04:13.999 --> 04:14.999
What did she expect?

04:14.999 --> 04:16.999
- Stay away from the words
"noncommittal,"

04:16.999 --> 04:17.999
especially when
you're around me

04:17.999 --> 04:19.999
and especially when
you're around Lisa.

04:19.999 --> 04:21.999
I'm allergic to that word.

04:21.999 --> 04:23.999
Whenever I hear it,
I get this tingling sensation

04:23.999 --> 04:25.999
right around this area.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.999
- I think when we go in there,
you should probably leave

04:27.999 --> 04:29.999
the talking mostly to me.

04:29.999 --> 04:31.999
- Are you serious?
- I'm dead serious.

04:31.999 --> 04:32.999
- No, dude,
I'm an eloquent guy.

04:32.999 --> 04:34.999
Listen, when I'm with you guys--
- I know you are.

04:34.999 --> 04:36.999
I know you are.
- I can handle myself in a sit--

04:36.999 --> 04:39.999
I can--I can perfectly
explain to her.

04:39.999 --> 04:41.999
Um...

04:43.999 --> 04:46.999
- I'm nervous about Schwartz
because Schwartz is nervous.

04:46.999 --> 04:49.999
But really, I just want him
not to talk.

04:49.999 --> 04:51.999
What I think we should do,
you know,

04:51.999 --> 04:53.999
is, like, going with
a brand ambassador route.

04:53.999 --> 04:55.999
- Less emphasis on sales.

04:55.999 --> 04:58.999
- More on just like spreading
the coolness of the product.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.999
- Yeah, I like that.

05:00.999 --> 05:02.999
- I don't think Tom realizes
that you can't just

05:02.999 --> 05:04.000
slip into business lingo

05:04.000 --> 05:05.999
and, all of a sudden,
you're a businessman.

05:05.999 --> 05:07.999
I think you have to be, like,
very, very clear

05:07.999 --> 05:09.999
about what your intentions are
and--

05:09.999 --> 05:11.999
- I don't think that we actually
need to be that clear,

05:11.999 --> 05:13.999
because we're not committing
to too much.

05:13.999 --> 05:15.999
- I think we would be
more valuable to them

05:15.999 --> 05:18.999
essentially being
a handsome face.

05:18.999 --> 05:22.999
- So your plan
is not to have a plan.

05:22.999 --> 05:24.999
Brilliant.

05:24.999 --> 05:26.999
I'm just saying that she's
probably not going to be

05:26.999 --> 05:28.000
expecting much
from the two of you,

05:28.000 --> 05:29.999
and I probably think
when you go in tomorrow,

05:29.999 --> 05:31.999
have something
a little more tangible.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.999
- Any ass**** can come in
with a presentation.

05:33.999 --> 05:35.999
Me and Schwartz
gotta come in as ourselves.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
This is, like, right up
my f***ing alley, dude.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.999
- Two Toms coming to
a f***ing market near you.

05:40.999 --> 05:44.999
- But can't make
any promises.

06:00.999 --> 06:02.999
- Hi, friend.
- Hi.

06:02.999 --> 06:03.999
- What's up?
- How are you?

06:03.999 --> 06:06.999
- I'm a little flustered.

06:06.999 --> 06:08.999
- I was hammered at Pride.
Lala was hammered at Pride.

06:08.999 --> 06:10.999
Well, hi, lovely.
How are you?

06:10.999 --> 06:12.999
- Hi, sweaty monkey.
- I haven't seen you--

06:12.999 --> 06:14.999
Mwah!

06:14.999 --> 06:16.999
- Hey, is she going home
with him?

06:16.999 --> 06:18.999
- I didn't do anything.

06:18.999 --> 06:19.999
I wanted to, trust me.

06:22.999 --> 06:26.999
I would have destroyed her,
but we couldn't.

06:26.999 --> 06:28.000
Um, what about with James?

06:28.999 --> 06:29.999
What's going on
with that situation?

06:29.999 --> 06:31.999
- I mean,
he's been texting me.

06:31.999 --> 06:32.999
- Do you hang out
with him still?

06:32.999 --> 06:34.999
- I haven't seen him
at all, no.

06:34.999 --> 06:36.999
- I think you should
steer clear of that.

06:36.999 --> 06:37.999
- Yeah,
so I've been told.

06:37.999 --> 06:41.999
I have not spoken with James
at all

06:41.999 --> 06:42.999
since I found out that
he f***ed my coworker.

06:42.999 --> 06:46.999
Who were you with...
that did whatever you like?

06:46.999 --> 06:48.999
- Lauren.

06:48.999 --> 06:51.999
- He has been texting me
nonstop.

06:51.999 --> 06:54.999
He's begging;
he's apologizing.

06:54.999 --> 06:56.999
He's like a little puppy.

06:56.999 --> 06:57.999
A sad puppy.

06:57.999 --> 06:59.999
Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

06:59.999 --> 07:00.999
- The other night
when you said

07:00.999 --> 07:02.999
that you and Brittany had
gone your separate ways--

07:02.999 --> 07:03.999
- Well, here's the thing.

07:03.999 --> 07:05.999
She's coming here again
Thursday,

07:05.999 --> 07:07.999
but the way I was thinking is,
until you move here and we--

07:08.000 --> 07:10.999
you say, "Let's make
this official,"

07:10.999 --> 07:11.999
I can't make it official.

07:11.999 --> 07:12.999
- So are you allowed to,
like,

07:12.999 --> 07:15.999
still go and have drinks
with me or no?

07:15.999 --> 07:17.999
- I can do that.
- You can do that still?

07:17.999 --> 07:19.999
- Yeah.
That's harmless, right?

07:19.999 --> 07:20.999
- That's harmless.
- Okay.

07:20.999 --> 07:22.999
- I'm not asking
to suck your d***.

07:22.999 --> 07:23.999
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

07:23.999 --> 07:25.999
- I'm asking you
to have a drink. God damn.

07:25.999 --> 07:26.999
- All right, well,
just tell me when you're off,

07:26.999 --> 07:27.999
and we'll figure it out.

07:27.999 --> 07:29.999
- I like that idea.
- Okay.

07:29.999 --> 07:30.999
- Thank you.

07:43.999 --> 07:45.999
- Hi.
I'm here to see James.

07:48.999 --> 07:51.999
- Mummy, hello.
- Mummy?

07:51.999 --> 07:54.999
- Oh, I missed you.
Are you doing good?

07:54.999 --> 07:55.999
I've always been close
with my mum.

07:55.999 --> 07:57.999
She's the one that told me
to get a job at Sur

07:57.999 --> 07:59.999
busing tables
after high school.

07:59.999 --> 08:01.999
I just haven't seen her
in a while.

08:01.999 --> 08:02.999
You all right?
- Yeah.

08:02.999 --> 08:04.999
You look beautiful.
- You ready for dinner?

08:04.999 --> 08:07.999
She's really done everything
for me, helping me.

08:07.999 --> 08:08.999
Welcome.
- Thank you.

08:08.999 --> 08:10.999
- This is
the beautiful Sur.

08:10.999 --> 08:12.999
- To your home
away from home.

08:12.999 --> 08:14.999
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

08:14.999 --> 08:15.999
- I'm Kristina.
- I'm Jacqueline.

08:15.999 --> 08:16.999
Nice to meet you.
I'm James' mom.

08:16.999 --> 08:17.999
- Nice to meet you.
- This is my mum.

08:17.999 --> 08:19.999
- You're so beautiful.
- Thank you.

08:19.999 --> 08:20.999
- You look like
you could be his sister.

08:20.999 --> 08:22.999
- Oh, thank you.

08:22.999 --> 08:24.999
- You know, England,
when you are in the spotlight

08:24.999 --> 08:26.999
20 years ago
was a very small place.

08:26.999 --> 08:28.999
My dad was a pretty notorious
music manager,

08:28.999 --> 08:31.999
so obviously Ken and Lisa
knew who he was.

08:31.999 --> 08:32.999
Can we start off
with the goat cheese balls

08:32.999 --> 08:34.999
and a Greek salad, please?

08:34.999 --> 08:35.999
- You know the menu.

08:35.999 --> 08:37.000
- And my mum's
from New York state.

08:37.999 --> 08:38.999
When she was 14,

08:38.999 --> 08:40.999
she was signed to
Elite Modeling Agency.

08:40.999 --> 08:42.999
And within the year,
she was traveling the world

08:42.999 --> 08:44.999
modeling everywhere from
Bora Bora to Mauritius.

08:44.999 --> 08:46.999
Cheers. I love you.
- I love you.

08:46.999 --> 08:48.999
- And then one day in London
in a café,

08:48.999 --> 08:50.999
my dad walked in,
gave her a number,

08:50.999 --> 08:52.999
My dad was pretty much like,
"I'm gonna marry you one day."

08:52.999 --> 08:53.999
And my mum laughed...

08:53.999 --> 08:55.999
- Enjoy.

08:55.999 --> 08:56.999
- They got together.

08:56.999 --> 09:01.999
- Okay, so,
what's going on with...

09:01.999 --> 09:02.999
- Kristen?

09:02.999 --> 09:04.999
You know, it's been--
it's been a hard road.

09:04.999 --> 09:05.999
- I know.

09:05.999 --> 09:07.999
- It's been a really hard
f***ing road.

09:07.999 --> 09:08.999
Sorry.
- That's fine.

09:08.999 --> 09:13.000
- I'm convinced
that she basically...

09:13.999 --> 09:14.999
you know,
she screwed around.

09:14.999 --> 09:16.999
She's f***ing never
going to admit it

09:16.999 --> 09:18.999
'cause she never--excuse
my language again, I'm sorry.

09:18.999 --> 09:19.999
I don't think
anyone's ever hurt me

09:19.999 --> 09:21.999
as much as Kristen Doute has,

09:21.999 --> 09:25.999
if you want me to be
completely f***ing honest.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.999
I've had absolutely
enough, you know?

09:27.999 --> 09:28.999
- Just enjoy yourself.

09:28.999 --> 09:30.999
- Yeah, and I'm gonna
work on my music.

09:30.999 --> 09:31.999
- Be with somebody kind,
you know?

09:31.999 --> 09:35.999
Go to dinner with pretty girls
and have fun with your friends.

09:35.999 --> 09:37.999
Enough with the drama.

09:37.999 --> 09:40.999
Believe me, you'll--
you'll--

09:40.999 --> 09:43.999
there's drama
down the line.

09:50.999 --> 09:52.999
- Oh, f***.
- Tell me. Tell me.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.999
- Oh, I don't know what to say.
- I know. It's sad.

09:56.999 --> 09:58.999
It's hard.
Don't cry.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.999
I love you.
You're my firstborn.

10:01.999 --> 10:05.999
There's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

10:05.999 --> 10:07.999
I'm here.

10:07.999 --> 10:10.999
Baby, there's a lot
to say.

10:10.999 --> 10:12.999
A lot to say.
- I know, Mum...

10:12.999 --> 10:14.999
- It's only gonna get better.

10:14.999 --> 10:15.999
- I just don't understand

10:15.999 --> 10:19.999
how you and Dad
are breaking up.

10:19.999 --> 10:21.999
Like, I don't understand
how it's been 24 years

10:21.999 --> 10:24.999
and you just--you moved out
of the apartment.

10:24.999 --> 10:29.999
- I didn't just--James,
you have to realize I'm 45.

10:29.999 --> 10:31.999
You know? I need to live
my life and so does he.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.999
- You know, I get that people
get divorced all the time,

10:34.999 --> 10:36.999
but it's like my parents
are getting divorced this time,

10:36.999 --> 10:39.999
so, f***,
just gonna be really hard.

10:43.999 --> 10:45.999
Look, I've been going through
a really hard time with this,

10:45.999 --> 10:46.999
to be honest, okay?

10:47.000 --> 10:48.999
And I take it out
through alcohol,

10:48.999 --> 10:50.999
and sometimes, you know,
it scares me

10:50.999 --> 10:52.000
because those are things

10:52.000 --> 10:54.999
that have been numb'ers
in our family.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.999
- The worst thing is for
somebody to drink

10:57.000 --> 10:58.999
when they're in
a bad place.

10:58.999 --> 11:00.999
I've been there.

11:00.999 --> 11:04.000
I've been there way back
in London when I was modeling.

11:04.999 --> 11:06.999
They loved me
to make an idiot of myself,

11:06.999 --> 11:07.999
because you know what?

11:07.999 --> 11:09.999
Somebody else
is gonna get the job.

11:09.999 --> 11:11.999
You know, you want to be
on the ball.

11:11.999 --> 11:15.999
If you're at a club, you want
to be the man in the room

11:15.999 --> 11:18.999
that's meeting people
to advance yourself.

11:18.999 --> 11:19.999
- Right.

11:19.999 --> 11:21.999
Every single woman that's
involved in my life right now--

11:21.999 --> 11:23.999
just causing me stress.

11:23.999 --> 11:25.999
So obviously
I take it too far.

11:25.999 --> 11:26.999
Obviously I'm f***ing
pounding the bottle.

11:26.999 --> 11:28.999
You know, I want to drain out
my f***ing emotions

11:28.999 --> 11:30.999
for the night and have fun.

11:30.999 --> 11:31.999
That's all I want to do.

11:31.999 --> 11:33.999
- I have to get up.
- Why?

11:34.000 --> 11:35.999
- 'Cause I want to hug you
and tell you

11:35.999 --> 11:41.999
how absolutely proud I am
of you.

11:41.999 --> 11:43.000
I'm so proud of you,

11:43.999 --> 11:45.999
and I love you so much,
hmm?

11:45.999 --> 11:48.999
- Love you too, Mummy.

11:48.999 --> 11:49.999
- 30 seconds, guys.
Keep pushing.

11:49.999 --> 11:51.000
All the way out.
There it is.

11:51.999 --> 11:52.999
- I heard a rumor

11:52.999 --> 11:54.999
that you and Brittany
broke up this weekend.

12:12.999 --> 12:13.999
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:13.999 --> 12:16.999
- Welcome.
- I'm so boxing chic right now.

12:16.999 --> 12:18.999
- So much fun, dude.
Get all your aggression out.

12:18.999 --> 12:20.000
- You must come here
a lot then.

12:20.999 --> 12:21.999
- A lot.

12:21.999 --> 12:22.999
- I'm really excited
about this.

12:22.999 --> 12:24.999
I know you can't tell
because I just had Botox,

12:24.999 --> 12:25.999
but this is excitement.

12:25.999 --> 12:29.999
- Jax and I have
a very complicated

12:29.999 --> 12:30.999
f***ed-up friendship.

12:30.999 --> 12:33.999
But we've been friends
for almost ten years,

12:33.999 --> 12:35.999
and I literally feel like
I'm gonna roll over in my grave

12:35.999 --> 12:40.999
for saying this when I die,
but Jax is loyal.

12:41.999 --> 12:42.999
I have a date on Tuesday.

12:42.999 --> 12:44.999
- What is his name?
- Alex.

12:44.999 --> 12:45.999
Yacht captain.

12:45.999 --> 12:46.999
- Oh, I know Alex.

12:46.999 --> 12:47.999
He's a good guy.
Good.

12:47.999 --> 12:49.999
- I know; he's, like,
the opposite of my type.

12:49.999 --> 12:52.999
- Yeah.
- He has money and a career...

12:52.999 --> 12:53.999
- Yeah.
- And goals.

12:53.999 --> 12:55.999
- No, you've never
dated a guy like that.

12:55.999 --> 12:56.999
Let's kick some ass in here.

13:00.999 --> 13:02.999
- 30 seconds, guys.
Keep pushing.

13:02.999 --> 13:03.999
All the way out.
There it is.

13:03.999 --> 13:05.999
- This is James' face
right here.

13:05.999 --> 13:08.999
- James' face?

13:08.999 --> 13:10.999
- Full extension
on those punches.

13:10.999 --> 13:11.999
There it is.
15 seconds.

13:11.999 --> 13:12.999
Everything you got.

13:12.999 --> 13:14.999
Three, two, one.

13:14.999 --> 13:16.999
Great job, prevailers.

13:16.999 --> 13:17.999
Way to work.

13:17.999 --> 13:18.999
Everybody worked hard today.

13:18.999 --> 13:19.999
- It's f***ing hard.

13:19.999 --> 13:22.000
Sit-ups, push-ups, burpees,
squat thrusts.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.999
- f*** burpees, man.

13:23.999 --> 13:26.999
- So I heard a rumor
that you and Brittany

13:26.999 --> 13:28.999
broke up this weekend.

13:30.999 --> 13:31.999
- You know, I'm trying
to do it right this time.

13:31.999 --> 13:33.999
Like, she is moving here, yes,

13:33.999 --> 13:34.999
but I didn't want
to call her my girl--

13:34.999 --> 13:35.999
- She's not moving in
with you.

13:35.999 --> 13:38.999
- No, no, no,
but she hasn't moved here yet.

13:38.999 --> 13:40.999
We didn't break up
and then get back together.

13:40.999 --> 13:42.999
We were just trying to
figure out what was going on.

13:42.999 --> 13:44.999
Like, we weren't sure
if she was coming here

13:44.999 --> 13:47.999
or how she's gonna get here,
because much as I do like her,

13:47.999 --> 13:49.999
I'm not gonna be paying for her
to come here every weekend.

13:49.999 --> 13:51.999
You ready?
- Okay. Yeah.

13:51.999 --> 13:53.999
I got to go because
there's a maid at my house.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.999
James is coming over.

13:55.999 --> 13:57.999
- If I find out
that you're like,

13:57.999 --> 13:58.999
"We're gonna give it
another try"...

13:58.999 --> 14:00.999
- Oh, Jax, I swear to God,

14:00.999 --> 14:02.999
there is not an amount
of f***ing money in this world

14:02.999 --> 14:04.999
that would ever, ever
get me back together

14:04.999 --> 14:06.999
with that f***ing douche bag,
ever.

14:06.999 --> 14:07.999
I don't know what
he's trying to prove.

14:07.999 --> 14:10.999
I don't know, like--
parading bite marks around,

14:10.999 --> 14:11.999
saying he's banged
all these girls.

14:11.999 --> 14:13.999
- So who did you f***?
What is with this?

14:13.999 --> 14:15.999
Where is this from?
- Kristen can tell you.

14:15.999 --> 14:17.999
I like to get bit,
remember, babe?

14:17.999 --> 14:18.999
- All right.

14:18.999 --> 14:19.999
- Little piece of sh**,
son of a bitch

14:19.999 --> 14:21.999
23-year-old brat.

14:21.999 --> 14:23.999
Like, suck it, man.
Done.

14:23.999 --> 14:24.999
- I'm gonna take
your word for it.

14:24.999 --> 14:25.999
- I want a real man.

14:25.999 --> 14:26.999
I want a bunch of real men.

14:26.999 --> 14:27.999
I want to be
a make-out whore.

14:27.999 --> 14:28.999
- I'm really rooting
for Kristen.

14:28.999 --> 14:30.999
She was in such
a toxic relationship

14:30.999 --> 14:33.999
for so long that she doesn't
know how to be happy.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.999
Just have some fun.
No strings.

14:35.999 --> 14:37.999
Just be by yourself.

14:37.999 --> 14:38.999
Get a dog.

14:38.999 --> 14:41.999
- Yeah, I keep
thinking about it.

14:43.999 --> 14:46.999
- ♪ Get it, get it
started now ♪

14:52.999 --> 14:56.000
♪ Get it, get it
started now ♪

14:56.999 --> 14:57.000
- Hello.
- Hello.

14:57.999 --> 14:58.999
- Hello.
- Hi.

14:58.999 --> 14:59.999
- Okay, you're probably
wondering

14:59.999 --> 15:00.999
why I've called
this meeting.

15:00.999 --> 15:01.999
- Yes.
- Little bit.

15:01.999 --> 15:03.999
- You think you're
in trouble, don't you?

15:03.999 --> 15:05.999
- Let's just be clear
about what happened on Pride.

15:05.999 --> 15:07.999
I showed up with
scratches on my back.

15:07.999 --> 15:10.999
Lala got f***ing
furious with me.

15:10.999 --> 15:12.999
I revealed that I
f***ed Lauren the other night.

15:12.999 --> 15:13.999
I was wasted.

15:13.999 --> 15:15.000
- Well, for once,
you're not.

15:15.999 --> 15:16.999
Yay.

15:16.999 --> 15:17.999
- Yeah, all right.

15:17.999 --> 15:19.999
- Thank you, Lord.

15:19.999 --> 15:21.999
- I met this girl,
Arielle.

15:21.999 --> 15:25.999
She has been helping
these homeless youth.

15:25.999 --> 15:28.999
I think they're
between 18 and 21.

15:28.999 --> 15:30.999
They've never been
to a restaurant before,

15:30.999 --> 15:34.999
so 16 of them are coming here
tomorrow night.

15:34.999 --> 15:37.999
I mean, the staff can be
really bloody lousy

15:37.999 --> 15:40.999
and narcissistic and young
and egotistical,

15:40.999 --> 15:42.999
and this is a day
where they can actually

15:42.999 --> 15:44.999
put aside their bullsh**,

15:44.999 --> 15:47.999
and they can actually
give back.

15:47.999 --> 15:51.999
I'd like you to make them feel
like this is their day.

15:51.999 --> 15:55.999
- I am more than happy to give
as much of my time as needed.

15:55.999 --> 15:57.999
Lisa has a busier life
than all of us combined.

15:57.999 --> 16:00.999
If she has the time
to do this, so do we.

16:00.999 --> 16:03.999
- Will you stop looking like
it's the end of the world?

16:03.999 --> 16:04.999
- It's not the end
of the world.

16:04.999 --> 16:05.999
- No, it's not
the end of the world.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.999
You are a very
privileged young man.

16:07.999 --> 16:09.999
- I know I am.
- I want you to understand that.

16:09.999 --> 16:10.999
- I know.

16:10.999 --> 16:11.999
- You're looking
like you've got

16:11.999 --> 16:12.999
the worries of the world
on your shoulders.

16:12.999 --> 16:13.999
- I'll be here
whatever time you need me,

16:13.999 --> 16:15.999
and I'll be busing
all these tables back here,

16:15.999 --> 16:16.999
killing it,
so I'm excited.

16:16.999 --> 16:18.999
I understand
that I'm very privileged.

16:18.999 --> 16:20.999
You know,
I thank God every day

16:20.999 --> 16:21.999
for all the things
that I've got in my life,

16:21.999 --> 16:23.999
but at the same time,
I've got sh**

16:23.999 --> 16:25.999
in my personal life
that nobody at Sur knows about.

16:25.999 --> 16:27.999
I'm not gonna
just walk in here

16:27.999 --> 16:28.999
and tell people about
my parents' problems

16:28.999 --> 16:29.999
or my issues.

16:29.999 --> 16:32.999
It's no one's business.

16:32.999 --> 16:33.999
- All right, well,
I will see you tomorrow.

16:33.999 --> 16:35.999
- All right, sounds good.
- Thank you.

16:35.999 --> 16:38.999
- All right, yes.
- Thanks, Lisa.

16:38.999 --> 16:40.999
- Getting your pitch
ready for tomorrow?

16:40.999 --> 16:41.999
- Yeah, of course.

16:41.999 --> 16:42.999
- So how's the proposal going?

16:42.999 --> 16:44.999
- I think it's
going pretty good.

16:44.999 --> 16:46.000
I mean, we have
a pretty good idea

16:46.000 --> 16:47.999
of what we want to bring
and...

16:47.999 --> 16:49.999
- Tom, if you're gonna
pitch something,

16:49.999 --> 16:51.999
you need to come up with
a little more than that.

16:51.999 --> 16:52.999
- Yeah, you know--yeah.

16:52.999 --> 16:54.999
- You know, research
your product,

16:54.999 --> 16:56.999
where it's sold,
how much volume,

16:56.999 --> 16:58.999
you know, so you go in
equipped, you know?

16:58.999 --> 16:59.999
- Yeah.

16:59.999 --> 17:01.999
- I'm not sure if I'm psychic,

17:01.999 --> 17:03.999
but my premonition is,
the next meeting,

17:03.999 --> 17:05.999
they're gonna be
no more bloody prepared

17:05.999 --> 17:06.999
than they were the last.

17:06.999 --> 17:07.999
- All right, well,
I'll see you tomorrow.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
- I'll see you tomorrow.
Perfect.

17:09.999 --> 17:10.000
All right, bye.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.999
- Hey, how's it going?

17:14.999 --> 17:15.999
- Good.

17:15.999 --> 17:17.999
I went by
Social Security today

17:17.999 --> 17:18.999
and officially
changed my name.

17:18.999 --> 17:19.999
- That's really exciting.
- Yeah.

17:19.999 --> 17:21.999
- Especially 'cause,
I mean,

17:21.999 --> 17:22.999
I didn't know
if it was gonna happen.

17:22.999 --> 17:27.999
- Well, I mean, we still
have work to do with us.

17:27.999 --> 17:29.999
I'm still looking for
the right therapist

17:29.999 --> 17:31.999
who specializes
in the things that we need.

17:31.999 --> 17:32.999
Shay and I are gonna
start therapy.

17:32.999 --> 17:34.999
I mean,
that's awesome.

17:34.999 --> 17:39.999
So I'm hoping this is him
finally turning a new leaf.

17:39.999 --> 17:41.999
Your best friend
is working tonight.

17:41.999 --> 17:43.999
- Hey, I'm not going
to be mean to her.

17:43.999 --> 17:46.999
- It's funny, because she's,
like, the last person

17:46.999 --> 17:48.999
I actually thought I would
remotely click with.

17:48.999 --> 17:51.999
- I kept thinking that we would,
but it just hasn't happened,

17:51.999 --> 17:52.999
and it's just--I don't know--
I mean, I think--

17:52.999 --> 17:55.999
- I would say just maybe
give it one more chance.

17:55.999 --> 17:57.999
I have been
a little down on Lala,

17:57.999 --> 17:59.999
but ever since the night
at Golden Box...

17:59.999 --> 18:02.999
- The way you are making me
sound to people, I'm offended.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.999
I thought you were--
- What did I say?

18:04.999 --> 18:05.999
- You said last night,
"I have your back."

18:05.999 --> 18:07.999
- I do have your back.
- You don't have my back.

18:07.999 --> 18:08.999
- Makes me
extremely proud of her

18:08.999 --> 18:11.999
and someone I could
maybe be friends with.

18:11.999 --> 18:14.999
- You know how I am
about--when people lie.

18:14.999 --> 18:16.999
My whole thing is just like,
if you're gonna come in

18:16.999 --> 18:17.999
and you're gonna be that girl,
like, you can be that girl,

18:17.999 --> 18:19.999
but I'm not gonna
be friends with that girl.

18:19.999 --> 18:21.999
- Yeah.

18:28.999 --> 18:30.999
- I'm excited for tomorrow.
That'll be fun, you know?

18:30.999 --> 18:31.999
It's a good cause.

18:31.999 --> 18:32.999
I'm really excited about it.
- Yeah.

18:32.999 --> 18:34.999
- Not too excited about
going to pick up

18:34.999 --> 18:35.999
my last belongings
at Kristen's right now.

18:35.999 --> 18:37.999
- You're going to
Kristen's right now?

18:37.999 --> 18:40.999
Yeah, I saw her today.
- Did you?

18:40.999 --> 18:41.999
- Yeah, we went
to boxing class.

18:41.999 --> 18:42.999
- What, just you and her?

18:42.999 --> 18:45.999
- Yeah, she invited me
to a boxing class thing.

18:45.999 --> 18:47.999
Whatever.

18:47.999 --> 18:48.999
- But you don't think
that's kind of weird,

18:48.999 --> 18:50.999
you're just, like, hanging out
with Kristen now?

18:50.999 --> 18:51.999
- Do I think
it's kind of weird?

18:51.999 --> 18:53.999
- Yeah, it's a little
strange, if you ask me.

18:53.999 --> 18:56.999
- Dude, it's--I'm so far past
my past with all this.

18:56.999 --> 18:57.999
- Are you, though, Jax?

18:57.999 --> 18:59.999
- Am I?
- Are you?

18:59.999 --> 19:01.999
I mean, I wouldn't--
I wouldn't go saying that.

19:01.999 --> 19:03.999
Why the f*** is Kristen
hanging out with Jax?

19:03.999 --> 19:05.999
Is there some, like,
f***ed-up universe

19:05.999 --> 19:07.000
where Jax and Kristen
end up together?

19:07.000 --> 19:08.999
I mean, think about it.

19:08.999 --> 19:10.999
Maybe they're f***ing
perfect for each other.

19:10.999 --> 19:11.999
Maybe they're a match
made in heaven.

19:11.999 --> 19:13.000
- She's going on a date
with a friend of mine,

19:13.000 --> 19:14.999
and I was giving her
advice about it.

19:14.999 --> 19:15.999
- Who?
- Alex.

19:15.999 --> 19:16.999
I just didn't see the--
- Why do you care?

19:16.999 --> 19:18.999
You're hooking up
with Lauren.

19:18.999 --> 19:19.999
- It doesn't f***ing matter
what I do, Jax.

19:19.999 --> 19:20.999
- Okay, then why do you
care what I do?

19:20.999 --> 19:21.999
- 'Cause it's funny.

19:21.999 --> 19:22.999
It's funny that
you step in on it

19:22.999 --> 19:23.999
the second
I get done with her.

19:23.999 --> 19:24.999
That's what's
funny about it.

19:24.999 --> 19:26.999
- I have a girl. I'm good, dude.
- Do you?

19:26.999 --> 19:27.999
Do you have a girl right now?
- Yeah.

19:27.999 --> 19:28.999
- 'Cause I saw you
talking

19:28.999 --> 19:30.000
to Lala outside
as well yesterday.

19:30.999 --> 19:31.999
- Yeah, I was talking
to Lala.

19:31.999 --> 19:32.999
I'm having drinks
with her, actually.

19:32.999 --> 19:34.000
- Good luck with it.
Good luck with that, man.

19:34.999 --> 19:35.999
- James, it's
a boxing class, man.

19:35.999 --> 19:36.999
- Okay, cool.
- James...

19:36.999 --> 19:37.999
- And I have nothing
to hide.

19:37.999 --> 19:39.000
What else do you
want to know?

19:39.999 --> 19:40.000
- Listen,
I've got my own

19:40.999 --> 19:41.999
sh** going on
right now, okay?

19:41.999 --> 19:42.999
- Then good.
The more you brag about this--

19:42.999 --> 19:43.999
- This is like
a pissing contest.

19:43.999 --> 19:45.999
- Doing fine for my
f***ing self--you know what?

19:45.999 --> 19:46.999
I honestly just wanted
to chat with him

19:46.999 --> 19:47.999
about this f***ing
crazy girl

19:47.999 --> 19:48.999
that I have to go
meet up with again.

19:48.999 --> 19:49.999
Okay, you have fun.
I'm out.

19:49.999 --> 19:51.999
See you guys later.

19:54.999 --> 19:55.000
- Coming up...

19:55.999 --> 19:56.999
- You got nothing
going for you.

19:56.999 --> 19:57.999
You got nothing but
a sh***y T-shirt line.

19:57.999 --> 19:59.999
- You're so upset right now.

19:59.999 --> 20:00.999
- You've lost all of your
f***ing friends.

20:00.999 --> 20:02.999
- You're so upset right now.
- You got nothing but Jax.

20:14.999 --> 20:20.999
♪ Am I the one that you
invite over late at night? ♪

20:22.999 --> 20:26.999
♪ Am I just another one
of your girls? ♪

20:26.999 --> 20:28.999
- Oh, I've been
looking for this.

20:28.999 --> 20:30.999
- Well, you left it here.

20:30.999 --> 20:31.999
That's everything.

20:31.999 --> 20:32.999
- That's everything?

20:32.999 --> 20:35.999
Cool.
- All your sh** gone.

20:35.999 --> 20:36.999
- Well, I guess
this is it, then.

20:36.999 --> 20:38.999
Glad to see you're making
the right decisions,

20:38.999 --> 20:40.999
you know, going out
with Jax's friends.

20:40.999 --> 20:42.999
- How do you know about Alex?
- Jax told me.

20:42.999 --> 20:44.999
Obviously he's
throwing it in my face.

20:44.999 --> 20:46.999
- James always fixates
on the fact

20:46.999 --> 20:48.999
that I cheated on Tom
with Jax.

20:48.999 --> 20:51.999
That is why James
hates Jax so much.

20:51.999 --> 20:54.999
It is time for you
to get over this Jax thing.

20:54.999 --> 20:55.999
- Hey, I wish you
the best of luck,

20:55.999 --> 20:58.999
and I wish more luck upon
whoever ends up with you.

20:58.999 --> 21:00.999
I really do.
- Oh, that's hateful.

21:00.999 --> 21:01.999
- I'm not hateful.

21:01.999 --> 21:02.999
It's just--
been thinking a lot

21:02.999 --> 21:04.999
about our relationship,
and I really thought

21:04.999 --> 21:06.999
I was gonna miss you, Kristen,
but, you know, I've honestly

21:06.999 --> 21:08.999
been thinking more
about Lala than you

21:08.999 --> 21:09.999
the last couple days...

21:09.999 --> 21:10.999
- And then Lauren?

21:10.999 --> 21:11.999
- Which is kind of insane.

21:11.999 --> 21:13.999
Nah, Lauren, not even.

21:13.999 --> 21:14.999
- You f***ed Lauren...

21:14.999 --> 21:15.999
- Doesn't matter
what I did.

21:15.999 --> 21:16.999
- Made out with Lala.

21:16.999 --> 21:18.999
You're just, like,
going down the Sur chain.

21:18.999 --> 21:20.999
Start with the hostesses,
move up to some waitresses.

21:20.999 --> 21:21.999
- Maybe.

21:21.999 --> 21:23.999
I'm gonna enjoy myself,
you know?

21:23.999 --> 21:26.999
Be the 23-year-old, you know,
you always said I could be.

21:26.999 --> 21:28.999
- It's not a good look.

21:28.999 --> 21:30.999
James has been
such a cocky little f***

21:30.999 --> 21:32.999
ever since we broke up,

21:32.999 --> 21:34.999
but he's actually
the most insecure little boy

21:34.999 --> 21:35.999
I have ever met.

21:35.999 --> 21:38.999
You have a lot of nerve.

21:38.999 --> 21:39.999
Eight days ago--
"Baby, I love you.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.000
Baby, I love you."
And then, what--

21:41.999 --> 21:42.999
- What, when you were
f***ing someone else

21:42.999 --> 21:43.999
in f***ing Michigan?

21:43.999 --> 21:45.999
- Oh, nice try.
- I know that was happening.

21:45.999 --> 21:48.999
- And then a few days ago,
you have the audacity

21:48.999 --> 21:51.999
to parade around a bunch
of bite marks and scratch marks.

21:51.999 --> 21:53.000
- Remember when you
used to do that?

21:53.000 --> 21:54.999
Remember when you
used to do that?

21:54.999 --> 21:57.999
- If there's any, like,
soul left inside

21:57.999 --> 22:00.000
of this, like, ratchet,
like, facade and aura

22:00.000 --> 22:01.999
that you're putting up,
this front--

22:01.999 --> 22:03.999
- Honey, you're ratchet.
Look at you.

22:03.999 --> 22:04.999
- Stop f***ing talking.

22:04.999 --> 22:06.999
Don't f***ing talk to me
like that again.

22:06.999 --> 22:07.999
- Just saying the truth.
- You're disgusting.

22:07.999 --> 22:08.999
You f***ing speak
to women like that?

22:08.999 --> 22:10.000
What the f***
is wrong with you?

22:10.999 --> 22:11.999
- What women? Just you.
- You, like--you--

22:11.999 --> 22:13.999
- Women that f*** their
boyfriends--other men--

22:13.999 --> 22:15.999
- You 23-year-old
son of a bitch.

22:15.999 --> 22:16.999
- Women that f*** other men
on their boyfriend's birthday.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.999
That's why I talk
to you like that.

22:18.999 --> 22:19.999
- You know what
I wanted to do, James?

22:19.999 --> 22:20.999
- That's why I talk
to you like that.

22:20.999 --> 22:22.999
- I wanted to f***ing cry
in the back of Sur.

22:22.999 --> 22:23.999
I wanted to f***ing
scream at you.

22:23.999 --> 22:25.999
You are going to drink
yourself into oblivion,

22:25.999 --> 22:26.999
you're gonna get
f***ing fired,

22:26.999 --> 22:28.999
you're gonna lose
all your f***ing friends,

22:28.999 --> 22:29.999
and no one's gonna--

22:29.999 --> 22:30.999
- Okay, you know
what you're gonna do?

22:30.999 --> 22:31.999
You're never
gonna get married,

22:31.999 --> 22:32.999
and if you do,
you're gonna be divorced

22:32.999 --> 22:33.999
in the first three years.

22:33.999 --> 22:34.999
- Really?
- Yeah, f*** yeah, you will be.

22:34.999 --> 22:36.999
- Go f*** yourself.

22:36.999 --> 22:37.999
- You're gonna cheat
on your f***ing husband.

22:37.999 --> 22:38.999
You got nothing
going for you.

22:38.999 --> 22:40.999
You got nothing but
a sh***y T-shirt line.

22:40.999 --> 22:41.999
You're fired from Sur
already from drinking.

22:41.999 --> 22:43.999
- You're so upset
right now.

22:43.999 --> 22:44.999
- You've lost all of
your f***ing friends.

22:44.999 --> 22:45.999
- You're so upset
right now.

22:45.999 --> 22:46.999
- You've got nothing but Jax

22:46.999 --> 22:48.999
and his f***ing friend
to go out with on Friday.

22:48.999 --> 22:49.999
Go have fun with that.
- You know Alex.

22:49.999 --> 22:51.999
- Go have fun with that.
- You know Alex.

22:51.999 --> 22:52.999
- Yeah, I don't give
a f*** if I know him.

22:52.999 --> 22:55.999
Ew, you f***ing
nasty slut, you are.

22:55.999 --> 22:57.999
- Get out of my apartment
before I call security.

22:57.999 --> 22:59.999
- You smell bad.
****.

22:59.999 --> 23:01.999
- You did not just
spit on my door.

23:01.999 --> 23:02.999
- Yeah, bitch.

23:02.999 --> 23:03.999
Bye, slut.

23:03.999 --> 23:05.999
- Ew.

23:05.999 --> 23:07.999
I just had my f***ing
apartment cleaned.

23:15.999 --> 23:17.999
- ♪ I'm coming up now ♪

23:17.999 --> 23:19.999
♪ Ain't gonna slow down ♪

23:19.999 --> 23:23.999
♪ I won't stop till
I'm ruling the world ♪

23:23.999 --> 23:24.999
- Hello?

23:24.999 --> 23:26.999
- Hey, how are you?
- Hi.

23:26.999 --> 23:27.999
- They're gonna be here
in a minute, aren't they?

23:27.999 --> 23:28.999
Hi, darling.
- Yeah, come on in.

23:28.999 --> 23:30.999
- They're supposed to be.
- How are you?

23:30.999 --> 23:32.999
- I'm just interested
to really see

23:32.999 --> 23:33.999
what the Toms are gonna do.

23:33.999 --> 23:36.999
'Cause they're always asking me
for more responsibility.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.999
- I'd like to say
my expectations are high,

23:38.999 --> 23:40.999
but we've seen them
in the past.

23:40.999 --> 23:43.999
- Pandora and Jason have
taken the sangria business

23:43.999 --> 23:45.999
very seriously.

23:45.999 --> 23:47.999
This is their baby.

23:47.999 --> 23:51.999
This is the grandbaby
that I don't have.

23:51.999 --> 23:53.999
- Hey, we're gonna go see
Pandora and Jason.

23:54.999 --> 23:57.999
Hello?
- Hello.

23:57.999 --> 23:58.999
- Hey, what's up, guys?

23:58.999 --> 23:59.999
- How are you?
- How's it going?

23:59.999 --> 24:01.999
Welcome to the office.
How are you?

24:01.999 --> 24:02.999
- Hey, man, this is gorgeous.

24:02.999 --> 24:04.999
I'm sincerely excited
about this opportunity,

24:04.999 --> 24:05.999
because I got a lot of sh**
coming up.

24:05.999 --> 24:09.999
I mean, I got the ring,
then I got engagement parties,

24:09.999 --> 24:11.999
and then there's weddings,
and there's kids,

24:11.999 --> 24:15.999
and then college and...
f***.

24:15.999 --> 24:16.999
- Okay, let's hear it.

24:16.999 --> 24:17.999
- Well, guys,
we had time to think

24:17.999 --> 24:18.999
about what we talked about.

24:18.999 --> 24:21.999
We had time to digest it.

24:21.999 --> 24:24.999
After much deliberation,
we've came to the conclusion

24:24.999 --> 24:26.999
that it'd be better
for both parties involved

24:26.999 --> 24:29.999
if we were
brand ambassadors.

24:31.999 --> 24:33.999
Essentially championing
the brand.

24:33.999 --> 24:36.999
- What exactly do you mean
by "championing the brand"?

24:36.999 --> 24:38.999
- Well, just getting people
excited about it.

24:38.999 --> 24:40.999
Getting it in their hands
like we talked about.

24:40.999 --> 24:42.999
- How would you do that?
It's not a modeling job.

24:42.999 --> 24:44.999
- I just--we want to help
increase visibility

24:44.999 --> 24:46.999
and be brand ambassadors,
talking to people,

24:46.999 --> 24:48.999
telling them about
the product, you know.

24:48.999 --> 24:50.999
- I wish you would have let me
spoke first, by the way.

24:50.999 --> 24:51.999
- Go ahead.
- But, uh--the--

24:51.999 --> 24:54.999
This is exactly why
I didn't want Schwartz

24:54.999 --> 24:55.999
to do the talking.

24:55.999 --> 24:56.999
This is Negotiating 101.

24:56.999 --> 24:58.999
Like, it's kind of like
a game of poker.

24:58.999 --> 25:00.000
You don't want to show
all your cards.

25:00.999 --> 25:03.999
You want to play and react
off the other players.

25:03.999 --> 25:05.999
The thing is, is that
you're not selling it.

25:05.999 --> 25:07.999
When you have somebody
who's buying--

25:07.999 --> 25:12.999
when you're talking to--
you know, to the clients,

25:12.999 --> 25:15.999
you know, uh--what I'm
trying to--what--all right.

25:15.999 --> 25:18.999
The point I'm trying
to get at is that we want--

25:18.999 --> 25:19.999
- Tom, sorry, wait, sorry.

25:19.999 --> 25:21.999
- What's wrong with you?

25:23.999 --> 25:25.000
I don't know. Carry on.
- Okay.

25:25.999 --> 25:27.999
- Is there something
wrong with you guys?

25:27.999 --> 25:29.000
- I want to know what you guys
have been doing the last week

25:29.999 --> 25:30.999
since we last met,
because last week,

25:30.999 --> 25:32.999
you were really excited,
and we were excited.

25:32.999 --> 25:34.000
- No, we were really
excited.

25:34.999 --> 25:35.999
We are really excited.
- But you have no plan.

25:35.999 --> 25:36.999
- And I do have a plan.

25:36.999 --> 25:38.999
The problem is,
what we want to do

25:38.999 --> 25:40.999
is sort of just come on
as, like, you know,

25:40.999 --> 25:44.999
almost like pro bono,
in a way.

25:44.999 --> 25:46.999
- You guys seriously
want to work pro bono?

25:46.999 --> 25:49.999
- Well, I'm--
just, like, you know.

25:49.999 --> 25:50.999
We'll, what I'm thinking--

25:50.999 --> 25:52.999
- So you want to intern.

25:52.999 --> 25:54.999
- Brand ambassador/internship?

25:54.999 --> 25:55.999
- I don't know what
capacity you can use me

25:55.999 --> 25:56.999
as a "brand ambassador."

25:56.999 --> 25:57.999
- I'll put you in a Speedo,

25:57.999 --> 25:59.999
and you'll be
serving sangria.

25:59.999 --> 26:03.999
- No, no, I don't want to be--
I'm too old for that sh**.

26:03.999 --> 26:04.999
I don't know, man.

26:04.999 --> 26:06.999
f***, what did I
get myself into?

26:06.999 --> 26:08.999
- When you guys came to us,
it was about you

26:08.999 --> 26:10.999
wanting to change
your career

26:10.999 --> 26:11.999
and what you wanted
to do with your life,

26:11.999 --> 26:13.999
and you don't want to be
waiting tables,

26:13.999 --> 26:14.999
and you don't want
to be bartending,

26:14.999 --> 26:16.999
and now you want to be
the girl in the bar

26:16.999 --> 26:17.999
with the shots
on the tray?

26:17.999 --> 26:18.999
- No, no, no,
I don't want to be--

26:18.999 --> 26:19.999
I don't want to be--

26:19.999 --> 26:22.999
- It's a little bit
confusing.

26:22.999 --> 26:25.999
- This isn't going the way
you guys probably imagined.

26:29.999 --> 26:29.999
Oh...

26:29.999 --> 26:31.999
- But I just wanted
to let you know

26:31.999 --> 26:33.999
that I'm--I'm in.

26:33.999 --> 26:34.999
- No, like, how?

26:34.999 --> 26:36.999
How are you in?

26:36.999 --> 26:38.999
- Well, just--just what
she just explained.

26:38.999 --> 26:39.999
Is that too vague?

26:39.999 --> 26:42.999
- How could this plan
be too vague, Schwartzy?

26:42.999 --> 26:44.999
There's no plan
to be vague.

26:44.999 --> 26:46.999
Say you started on Monday.

26:46.999 --> 26:47.999
Where do you start?

26:47.999 --> 26:48.999
What do you do?

26:52.999 --> 26:54.999
- That's--that's
the issue that we're--

26:54.999 --> 26:56.999
that's the--
sort of the...

26:57.999 --> 26:59.999
You know,
this is not something

26:59.999 --> 27:02.999
where I can show up
on Monday morning and come in--

27:02.999 --> 27:03.999
I mean, I'm literally
gonna have to call you

27:03.999 --> 27:05.999
and talk to you
as my week goes on.

27:05.999 --> 27:06.999
- Yeah.

27:06.999 --> 27:09.999
I'm willing to commit
to being noncommittal.

27:09.999 --> 27:11.999
I'm good at
being noncommittal.

27:11.999 --> 27:13.999
I mean, what is
a career, anyways,

27:13.999 --> 27:17.999
besides, like, the beginning
of the march to death?

27:17.999 --> 27:19.999
So in light of
what we've presented...

27:19.999 --> 27:21.999
- What do you think?

27:21.999 --> 27:24.999
- Um, well, you want
to come on board,

27:24.999 --> 27:26.999
I don't have to pay you,
and you're gonna help

27:26.999 --> 27:27.999
promote LVP?

27:27.999 --> 27:29.999
I--yeah, I guess.

27:30.999 --> 27:31.999
- Nice.

27:31.999 --> 27:32.999
- Yeah, thanks a lot.

27:32.999 --> 27:34.999
- Yeah, guys, thank you so much.
- See you guys.

27:34.999 --> 27:35.999
- I really appreciate it.

27:35.999 --> 27:37.999
I know you guys
are busy, so...

27:37.999 --> 27:38.999
- Coming up...

27:38.999 --> 27:40.999
- Lala came up to me
and said, "Hey, listen,

27:40.999 --> 27:41.999
would you mind having
some drinks with me?"

27:41.999 --> 27:43.999
It's not like
it's a date thing.

27:43.999 --> 27:45.999
- She is bold.

28:03.999 --> 28:04.999
- We're home.
- Yeah.

28:04.999 --> 28:06.999
- You excited to be
back in this little box?

28:06.999 --> 28:08.999
- Yes, I'm very excited.

28:10.999 --> 28:12.999
That was long.

28:14.999 --> 28:15.999
I didn't even ask you,
by the way,

28:15.999 --> 28:17.999
how long are you
deciding to stay this time?

28:17.999 --> 28:19.999
- Till Thursday morning,
9:00 a.m.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.999
- Oh, we might
have to change that.

28:21.999 --> 28:23.999
- Why don't you
tell me these things?

28:23.999 --> 28:24.999
- Well, I figured you knew
you probably shouldn't

28:24.999 --> 28:27.000
make the first flight out.

28:27.999 --> 28:28.999
- 9:00 a.m. is not
the first flight out.

28:28.999 --> 28:32.999
- 9:00 a.m. in Jax's world
is the first flight out.

28:32.999 --> 28:33.999
When Brittany is here,

28:33.999 --> 28:35.000
she's definitely the one
I want to be with.

28:35.999 --> 28:37.999
It just gets a little fuzzy
when she's, like,

28:37.999 --> 28:38.999
three time zones away.

28:38.999 --> 28:42.999
So I wanted to tell you,
Lala came up to me and said,

28:42.999 --> 28:44.999
"Hey, listen, would you mind
having some drinks with me?"

28:44.999 --> 28:47.999
I'm like, "Yeah, I mean,
that's harmless, you know?"

28:47.999 --> 28:51.999
And then I'm like--
'cause I was kind of hesitant,

28:51.999 --> 28:53.000
I'm like,
"Yeah, that's okay.

28:53.999 --> 28:54.999
"I guess if
it's during the day,

28:54.999 --> 28:55.999
and, you know, we're
in a thing, that's fine."

28:55.999 --> 28:59.999
I mean, it's not like it's a--
you know, a date thing.

28:59.999 --> 29:02.999
'Cause I'm like, "You know,
my girlfriend's Brittany,"

29:02.999 --> 29:04.999
and she's like,
"Yeah, I heard about that,

29:04.999 --> 29:05.999
that you guys
are back together."

29:05.999 --> 29:06.999
I'm like, "Back together?
We never really broke up."

29:06.999 --> 29:08.999
- She is bold.

29:08.999 --> 29:11.000
- Well, but anyway,
that was the whole

29:11.999 --> 29:12.999
little spiel with that,
anyway.

29:12.999 --> 29:14.999
A little truth
goes a long way.

29:14.999 --> 29:17.999
- So what are we gonna do
when I move up here?

29:17.999 --> 29:19.999
- You know, I have--
you know, I--

29:19.999 --> 29:21.999
I love being with you,

29:21.999 --> 29:24.999
and I plan on being with you
for a very, very long time.

29:24.999 --> 29:25.999
- Mm-hmm.

29:25.999 --> 29:29.999
- I just--I don't want
to screw this up.

29:29.999 --> 29:31.999
I've screwed up every
relationship I've been in.

29:31.999 --> 29:32.999
- Mm-hmm.
- Every one.

29:32.999 --> 29:34.999
I like you a lot.

29:34.999 --> 29:36.999
I really just don't want
to f*** this up.

29:36.999 --> 29:38.999
- I don't want you to either.

29:38.999 --> 29:40.999
- That being said,

29:40.999 --> 29:44.999
I think that you
should stay with me.

29:47.999 --> 29:49.999
Man, I know I say, you know,
"This time is different.

29:49.999 --> 29:50.999
You know, this time
is different"...

29:50.999 --> 29:52.999
You know, I'm trying
to do it right this time,

29:52.999 --> 29:53.999
but I didn't want
to call her my girl--

29:53.999 --> 29:55.999
- She's not moving in with you.
- No, no, no.

29:55.999 --> 29:57.999
And I'm not pushing.
She's not moving in.

29:57.999 --> 29:58.999
She's not--none of that.

29:58.999 --> 29:59.999
- Kentucky--she's not
moving in, right?

30:00.000 --> 30:01.999
- She's not moving in,
I promise.

30:01.999 --> 30:02.999
I'm not doing that
ever again.

30:02.999 --> 30:06.999
But, you know,
this time, it's different.

30:06.999 --> 30:07.999
I'm really hungry.

30:07.999 --> 30:08.999
- I'm really sleepy.

30:08.999 --> 30:10.999
- So you're sleepy,
and I'm hungry.

30:10.999 --> 30:12.999
Can we kind of fit
some romance

30:12.999 --> 30:13.999
in the middle of that?

30:13.999 --> 30:14.999
- Oh, well, yeah.

30:14.999 --> 30:17.000
- I haven't seen you
in a week.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.999
I need some loving.

30:18.999 --> 30:20.999
- You can get all
the loving you want, babe.

30:20.999 --> 30:23.999
- Love that.

30:39.999 --> 30:42.999
- I don't know how many
people it is exactly.

30:42.999 --> 30:44.999
- You have to
make sure Faith knows

30:44.999 --> 30:46.000
what position she has.

30:46.999 --> 30:48.999
- I am really excited
for tonight.

30:48.999 --> 30:49.999
Lisa easily
could have served

30:49.999 --> 30:50.999
ice water, soda,

30:51.000 --> 30:53.999
and a little set menu
with three options,

30:53.999 --> 30:54.999
but she didn't do that.

30:54.999 --> 30:55.999
'Cause it's full menu.

30:55.999 --> 30:57.999
Like, whatever
they want, right?

30:57.999 --> 30:58.999
- It's full menu, yeah.

30:58.999 --> 31:00.999
- She's so giving,

31:00.999 --> 31:01.999
and I'm just like,

31:01.999 --> 31:03.999
"I can't wait until
I have that much money

31:03.999 --> 31:05.999
that I can just give it all."

31:05.999 --> 31:07.999
Not all of it--I mean, I need
a little bit for myself.

31:13.999 --> 31:16.999
- Dude, I should have never
let Schwartz speak first.

31:16.999 --> 31:17.999
- Why?

31:17.999 --> 31:19.999
- Well, neither me
nor Schwartz

31:19.999 --> 31:22.999
can be, like, this
Monday through Friday,

31:22.999 --> 31:23.999
going every day--

31:23.999 --> 31:25.999
I'm not f***ing
doing that sh**.

31:25.999 --> 31:26.999
I mean, basically,
by the end of the meeting,

31:26.999 --> 31:28.999
I wanted to be
in a way better situation

31:28.999 --> 31:31.999
than we are now,
but I was able

31:31.999 --> 31:33.999
to rescue us a little bit.

31:33.999 --> 31:35.999
Jason is very aggressive.

31:35.999 --> 31:37.999
I am not that aggressive.

31:37.999 --> 31:38.999
I mean, yes, I don't want
to be a career server,

31:38.999 --> 31:40.999
but I have other things
I'm working on.

31:40.999 --> 31:41.999
So I want it to be fun.

31:41.999 --> 31:43.999
I don't want it
to feel pressured.

31:43.999 --> 31:44.999
I don't want to feel
pressure.

31:44.999 --> 31:46.999
So we're taking baby steps,
but we are taking steps.

31:46.999 --> 31:49.999
- Tom doesn't really
want to be a salesperson

31:49.999 --> 31:50.999
in the traditional sense.

31:50.999 --> 31:52.999
The 9-to-5 hours
don't really work for him.

31:52.999 --> 31:56.999
These baby steps sound
a little more like fetus steps.

31:56.999 --> 31:59.999
Yeah.

31:59.999 --> 32:00.999
Yeah...

32:04.999 --> 32:06.999
- Hey.
- Hi.

32:06.999 --> 32:07.999
- Everything looks good.

32:07.999 --> 32:09.999
- The kids are arriving.

32:09.999 --> 32:13.999
- Oh, hello,
my sexy man.

32:13.999 --> 32:16.999
- Can I just tell you--
this is intense for me.

32:16.999 --> 32:19.999
Working here
and the James thing is--

32:19.999 --> 32:20.999
- Well, I'm gonna have
a little chat with him,

32:20.999 --> 32:22.999
because what he did
to Kristen is unacceptable.

32:22.999 --> 32:23.999
- Well, yeah,
you spit on someone?

32:23.999 --> 32:25.999
- Let alone a woman.
- That's disgusting.

32:25.999 --> 32:27.999
- I was like, "Get the f***
out of my apartment,"

32:27.999 --> 32:29.999
like, "Get the f*** out,"
and I opened up the door.

32:29.999 --> 32:31.999
He f***ing spits
on my door.

32:31.999 --> 32:33.999
- Oh, my God.

32:33.999 --> 32:34.999
So I'm gonna have a little
sit-down, a little powwow.

32:34.999 --> 32:35.999
- I think you should.

32:35.999 --> 32:37.999
- I think he needs
to apologize to her.

32:37.999 --> 32:38.999
- Um, yeah, I think
he does too.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.999
I mean, you and I
f***ed up,

32:40.999 --> 32:42.999
but that is a different--

32:42.999 --> 32:44.999
- That's what happens
when you're 22.

32:44.999 --> 32:47.999
- I'm putting James
at arm's length right now.

32:47.999 --> 32:49.999
He has a big
f***ing hill to climb

32:49.999 --> 32:51.999
if he thinks that he's gonna be
my friend again.

32:51.999 --> 32:53.999
Yeah, I'm cool to not be
a part of it at all.

33:02.999 --> 33:05.999
- So, hey, I got these
two things I just made,

33:05.999 --> 33:07.999
and I figured it'd be
kind of cool, like,

33:07.999 --> 33:10.999
right when they
first walk in

33:10.999 --> 33:12.999
to have, like, a cocktail
in a wine glass.

33:12.999 --> 33:13.999
- That is really cool.

33:13.999 --> 33:16.999
It'd be cool if you would
have included me on this.

33:16.999 --> 33:18.999
- This is just for when
they first walk in,

33:18.999 --> 33:19.999
so that way,
they don't all walk

33:19.999 --> 33:21.999
right up to the bar
immediately.

33:21.999 --> 33:24.999
- Yes,
that's a great idea.

33:24.999 --> 33:26.999
It was my idea to make
fancy drinks in the first place,

33:26.999 --> 33:29.999
and he goes
and whips up this thing

33:29.999 --> 33:32.000
without even talking to me.

33:32.999 --> 33:33.999
If I was a girl who was 18

33:33.999 --> 33:35.999
and going to a restaurant
for the first time,

33:35.999 --> 33:37.999
I'd probably want something
that's, like, pink.

33:37.999 --> 33:40.999
This isn't really
a drink thing.

33:40.999 --> 33:41.999
It's a Tom and me thing.

33:41.999 --> 33:43.999
This is about
Tom not consulting me.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.999
We're supposed to be partners,

33:45.999 --> 33:47.999
and if Tom doesn't
know that by now,

33:47.999 --> 33:50.999
then I don't--
I don't know.

33:50.999 --> 33:52.999
- Do you want to
come up with that?

33:52.999 --> 33:54.999
- "Do you want to
come up with that?"

33:54.999 --> 33:57.999
If you could feel better now.

33:57.999 --> 33:59.999
I got it.
Thank you.

33:59.999 --> 34:00.999
- It's safe to say
I'm definitely

34:00.999 --> 34:03.999
a more positive person
than Ariana,

34:03.999 --> 34:06.999
but sometimes when
the storm's brewing,

34:06.999 --> 34:08.999
I'll hide,
run for cover,

34:08.999 --> 34:10.999
but I deal with it.

34:10.999 --> 34:11.999
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:11.999 --> 34:12.999
- Oh, okay.

34:12.999 --> 34:15.999
- So this is
basically lemonade

34:15.999 --> 34:17.999
but with basil
and cucumber.

34:17.999 --> 34:18.999
- Okay, but I do think
we need one

34:18.999 --> 34:22.999
that's maybe more girly,
maybe pinker, sweeter.

34:22.999 --> 34:24.999
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:24.999 --> 34:25.999
- Just so we have
a bit of color.

34:25.999 --> 34:27.999
- I would put these in glasses
before you give them out.

34:27.999 --> 34:28.999
- Yeah, listen to Ariana.

34:28.999 --> 34:29.999
She knows the
girly stuff, right?

34:29.999 --> 34:32.999
- Yeah.

34:34.999 --> 34:36.999
- Yeah, of course I'm gonna
put those in glasses.

34:36.999 --> 34:37.999
- Coming up...

34:37.999 --> 34:38.999
- You shouldn't be
spitting on girls--

34:38.999 --> 34:40.999
- I did not spit
on any f***ing girls,

34:40.999 --> 34:41.999
so don't f***ing
tell me that I am.

34:55.999 --> 34:56.999
- Mmm.

34:56.999 --> 34:57.999
- Trays...

34:57.999 --> 35:00.999
- The guys are coming.

35:00.999 --> 35:01.999
- Hello.

35:01.999 --> 35:04.999
Hi, welcome to Sur.

35:04.999 --> 35:05.999
My hope for this evening

35:05.999 --> 35:08.999
is that the kids
feel welcomed

35:08.999 --> 35:09.999
and they experience something

35:09.999 --> 35:12.999
that they haven't
really enjoyed before.

35:12.999 --> 35:13.999
- We have drinks here.

35:13.999 --> 35:14.999
This is a strawberrini.

35:14.999 --> 35:15.999
That's a summer cooler.

35:15.999 --> 35:16.999
Help yourself.

35:16.999 --> 35:18.999
- Would you like
a refreshing beverage?

35:18.999 --> 35:19.999
- Well, welcome.

35:19.999 --> 35:21.999
This is Tom.
- Hello.

35:21.999 --> 35:22.999
- You guys make
some good drinks.

35:22.999 --> 35:24.999
- Thank you.
- This is Giggy.

35:24.999 --> 35:25.999
- Isn't he sweet?

35:25.999 --> 35:27.999
And this is my husband, Ken.

35:27.999 --> 35:28.999
- Hi, guys.

35:29.999 --> 35:31.999
- Are you flirting with me?

35:32.999 --> 35:35.999
Well, the answer is,
a little too long.

35:36.999 --> 35:38.999
- I hope you're all
hungry, you guys.

35:38.999 --> 35:40.000
- Are we getting
appetizers first?

35:40.000 --> 35:41.999
- Yeah.
- Yeah, whatever you want.

35:41.999 --> 35:43.999
- Ladies, do you know
what you'd like to start with?

35:43.999 --> 35:45.999
- I'm gonna go with
the lobster and crab.

35:45.999 --> 35:48.999
- Calamari is like a fish
that's quite chewy,

35:48.999 --> 35:49.999
you know, like--
but it's good.

35:49.999 --> 35:51.999
We'll order one for
the middle of the table.

35:51.999 --> 35:54.999
- Any questions you have,
refills, whatever you need.

35:54.999 --> 35:56.999
- Do any of you actually
live on the streets or not?

36:03.999 --> 36:04.999
- You were homeless.

36:04.999 --> 36:05.999
- Yeah, I came from,
like, downtown.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.999
- Do you have it now?
- I'm working on it.

36:09.999 --> 36:11.999
- Nice.
- So you're moving on up.

36:11.999 --> 36:14.999
- Working this dinner
just makes me reflect

36:14.999 --> 36:16.999
on my own life that much more.

36:16.999 --> 36:18.999
I mean, a month ago,
I didn't know

36:18.999 --> 36:19.999
if Shay and I
were gonna make it.

36:19.999 --> 36:22.999
And then I see
all these people here...

36:22.999 --> 36:23.999
- Can I do a shrimp cocktail?

36:23.999 --> 36:24.999
- Shrimp cocktail,
absolutely.

36:24.999 --> 36:28.999
Who are just so grateful
and so thankful,

36:28.999 --> 36:31.999
and it just makes me realize
that there are

36:31.999 --> 36:33.999
such bigger problems
in this world.

36:33.999 --> 36:35.999
- Put it in here.

36:35.999 --> 36:37.999
- Calamari--
you never tried it?

36:37.999 --> 36:39.999
- It's actually good.
- It's good, right?

36:42.999 --> 36:44.999
- The chicken
and shrimp dumplings.

36:44.999 --> 36:45.999
- Ooh, yay.

36:50.999 --> 36:52.999
- Well, I got a boyfriend,
but he's dragging ass.

36:54.999 --> 36:56.999
Well, that's good to know,
just in case.

36:56.999 --> 37:00.999
- Chocolate cake.

37:00.999 --> 37:01.999
Cheesecake.

37:01.999 --> 37:03.999
- Oh, there's the flan.

37:03.999 --> 37:05.999
- You guys, so we are all here
thanks to Lisa and Ken.

37:05.999 --> 37:08.999
- Don't worry about that--
- They made this possible.

37:09.999 --> 37:12.999
- I know she does
a lot of work with you guys.

37:12.999 --> 37:14.999
I think life's about
give and take,

37:14.999 --> 37:16.999
but giving is more important,
so here's to you, darling.

37:16.999 --> 37:17.999
- Thank you.

37:17.999 --> 37:20.999
- Cheers, guys.
- Yes!

37:20.999 --> 37:22.999
- So it sounds to me
like this is shaping up

37:22.999 --> 37:23.999
to be a really good birthday.

37:23.999 --> 37:24.999
You getting excited?

37:24.999 --> 37:27.999
- Yes, I got a bunch
of decorations.

37:27.999 --> 37:28.999
- Nice.
- Bubble wand.

37:28.999 --> 37:30.999
I have, like,
a big slingshot

37:30.999 --> 37:31.999
water balloon thing.

37:31.999 --> 37:32.999
- Nice.

37:32.999 --> 37:34.999
- We have a big birthday
coming up.

37:34.999 --> 37:35.999
I'm going to be...

37:35.999 --> 37:39.999
three decades.

37:39.999 --> 37:40.999
- A kids party for you, yes.

37:40.999 --> 37:42.999
- Never grow up.

37:42.999 --> 37:43.999
It's a trap.

37:43.999 --> 37:45.999
- Dude, I stopped aging
a long time ago.

37:45.999 --> 37:49.999
- I'm six times cooler than
your average five-year-old.

37:49.999 --> 37:51.999
- Can I get a couple
refills, please?

37:51.999 --> 37:52.999
- Okay.

37:52.999 --> 37:54.999
- You know how, like, I didn't
celebrate my birthday?

37:54.999 --> 37:55.999
I mean, I was, like, here?

37:55.999 --> 37:56.999
- Yeah, you had to work.

37:56.999 --> 37:59.999
- Well, I just
organized something.

37:59.999 --> 38:00.999
- Yeah?

38:00.999 --> 38:03.999
- All of the guys
are going to Vegas.

38:03.999 --> 38:04.999
- Bye.

38:04.999 --> 38:06.999
- It's gonna be me, you, Jax.
- Bye.

38:06.999 --> 38:08.999
- Wait, is Ariana
cool with that?

38:08.999 --> 38:09.999
- I'm sure she's not stoked.

38:09.999 --> 38:11.999
- No, I'm f***ing pissed
because I--

38:11.999 --> 38:14.999
when I get to sit at home
and do absolutely nothing.

38:14.999 --> 38:15.999
Like, that's not fun for me.

38:15.999 --> 38:18.999
I really, really hate

38:18.999 --> 38:21.999
heteronormative
f***ing bullsh**.

38:21.999 --> 38:24.000
You're not gonna tell me,
"This is a guys thing,

38:24.000 --> 38:25.999
and this is a girls thing."

38:25.999 --> 38:27.999
You guys have fun.
- You want me to not go?

38:27.999 --> 38:28.999
- Kind of.

38:31.999 --> 38:33.999
- I just haven't hung out
with these guys in a while.

38:33.999 --> 38:34.999
You know what I mean?

38:34.999 --> 38:36.999
- It's cool.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.999
Have fun.

38:39.999 --> 38:41.999
- Well, when would this trip--
- I'll be at work.

38:41.999 --> 38:43.999
- Thursday.

38:43.999 --> 38:46.999
- It's nice to know that
the day after my birthday,

38:46.999 --> 38:48.999
I'm not invited
to a big trip,

38:48.999 --> 38:50.999
so that's great.

38:53.999 --> 38:55.000
- Did I just put you
in an awkward position?

38:55.999 --> 38:56.999
- A little bit.

39:08.999 --> 39:10.999
- Yo, yo, yo, yo.
- What's up?

39:10.999 --> 39:11.999
- What's this deal--
Kristen calls me up,

39:11.999 --> 39:13.999
and she says that
you spit on her.

39:13.999 --> 39:14.999
- What?
- She called me up.

39:14.999 --> 39:16.999
She says,
"James went crazy."

39:16.999 --> 39:17.999
- Are you besties now
with her or something, mate?

39:17.999 --> 39:19.999
- We're always gonna
be good friends.

39:19.999 --> 39:20.999
- I did not spit at Kristen,

39:20.999 --> 39:23.999
nor would I ever
spit at a girl.

39:23.999 --> 39:24.999
- You did not just
spit on my door.

39:24.999 --> 39:25.999
- Yeah, bitch.

39:25.999 --> 39:26.999
- Why would she call me
and say this?

39:26.999 --> 39:28.999
- Dude, I would never
spit on a girl, first of all.

39:28.999 --> 39:30.999
Second of all,
I turned my head, I went--

39:30.999 --> 39:32.000
And it f***ing wasn't
even a loogey spit.

39:32.999 --> 39:34.999
It's just, like, a f***ing
little dribble spit on the door.

39:34.999 --> 39:35.999
- But why would you
spit on the door?

39:35.999 --> 39:37.000
- 'Cause she f***ing
had me going, mate.

39:37.999 --> 39:38.999
Just like you've got me
going right now.

39:38.999 --> 39:40.999
- So what? You don't need
to spit on people.

39:40.999 --> 39:41.999
- Then I'll f***ing
apologize to her next time.

39:41.999 --> 39:43.999
Every time I do--

39:43.999 --> 39:44.999
- But aren't you tired of saying
"I'm sorry" all the time?

39:44.999 --> 39:46.999
'Cause lately it's just been,

39:46.999 --> 39:47.999
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry."

39:47.999 --> 39:49.999
- Uh, I'm sorry,
someone coming up

39:49.999 --> 39:50.999
15 years older than me,
you're still saying sorry.

39:50.999 --> 39:52.999
- You say this all the time,
"I'm 22. I'm 22."

39:52.999 --> 39:54.999
- Well, aren't you still
saying "sorry" sometimes

39:54.999 --> 39:55.999
about sh** with
your girlfriends?

39:55.999 --> 39:56.999
- You do it all the time,
every day.

39:56.999 --> 39:57.999
- So do you, Jax.
- No, I don't.

39:57.999 --> 39:58.999
- Yeah, you do.
- You don't know me.

39:58.999 --> 40:00.999
You don't know my life.
- You don't know me.

40:00.999 --> 40:01.999
- You don't know my life.
- Yes, I do.

40:01.999 --> 40:02.999
- Really, 'cause my
ex-girlfriend

40:02.999 --> 40:04.999
is telling you all about it.

40:04.999 --> 40:05.999
- Your ex-girlfriend--
my friend of ten years.

40:05.999 --> 40:06.999
You shouldn't be
spitting on girls.

40:06.999 --> 40:08.999
- I did not spit
on any f***ing girls,

40:08.999 --> 40:09.999
so don't f***ing
tell me that I am

40:09.999 --> 40:10.999
when I didn't do that.

40:10.999 --> 40:12.999
I spat on her front door
on my way out.

40:12.999 --> 40:14.999
- You shouldn't be
spitting anyway.

40:14.999 --> 40:15.999
- Dude, I spat on
the bloody door.

40:15.999 --> 40:17.999
- Okay, stop it
right now.

40:17.999 --> 40:19.999
Stop it right now.

40:19.999 --> 40:20.999
Go on, out.

40:20.999 --> 40:22.999
You go in
different directions.

40:22.999 --> 40:23.999
- Why does this guy care?
- What?

40:23.999 --> 40:24.999
You come here--
- Why do I care?

40:24.999 --> 40:25.999
Because Kristen
is my friend.

40:25.999 --> 40:27.999
You're on a downward
spiral, man.

40:27.999 --> 40:29.999
- I'm a downward spiral, mate?
Take a look at your life.

40:30.999 --> 40:32.999
- All you do is bum money
off your ex-girlfriends.

40:32.999 --> 40:34.999
- Can you stop it?
Right now.

40:34.999 --> 40:36.999
- Hey, money well spent, mate.
Money well spent.

40:36.999 --> 40:37.999
- Okay, you know what?

40:37.999 --> 40:38.999
You can go home, James.
- Why?

40:38.999 --> 40:39.999
I'm working really hard.

40:39.999 --> 40:41.999
- Let me tell you this.

40:41.999 --> 40:43.999
You raise your voice
in my restaurant...

40:43.999 --> 40:45.999
will be the last thing
you do.

40:55.999 --> 40:57.999
will be the last thing
you do.

40:57.999 --> 41:00.999
When I say to you, "Shut up,"
you shut up.

41:03.999 --> 41:04.999
While I'm working?

41:04.999 --> 41:05.999
I just want to go back out
and bus tables again.

41:05.999 --> 41:07.999
- Stop it, okay?

41:07.999 --> 41:08.999
Calm down.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.999
Go out there,
put a smile on your face,

41:10.999 --> 41:12.999
and realize how
bloody lucky you are.

41:12.999 --> 41:15.999
- Thank you.
I'm sorry, Lisa.

41:18.999 --> 41:19.999
- Was it, like, backwash?

41:19.999 --> 41:20.999
- Whatever.
It doesn't matter.

41:20.999 --> 41:22.999
You shouldn't be
spitting in general.

41:22.999 --> 41:24.999
- Listen.

41:24.999 --> 41:25.999
Hey, listen.

41:25.999 --> 41:27.999
Don't you raise
your voice at me.

41:27.999 --> 41:28.999
- I'm not. I'm not--
- Don't you raise your voice.

41:28.999 --> 41:29.999
- Sorry.
I apologize.

41:29.999 --> 41:31.999
I'm gonna go back to work.

41:31.999 --> 41:32.999
I just--
it just irks me here.

41:32.999 --> 41:34.999
It's just like, honestly--
it's a down--

41:34.999 --> 41:36.999
like, everything
is revolving around him.

41:36.999 --> 41:37.999
- Just stop raising
your voice.

41:37.999 --> 41:39.999
Do you know what
we're hosting?

41:39.999 --> 41:40.999
- I understand,
and I apologize.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.999
Did you hear him
or my voice?

41:42.999 --> 41:44.999
- I heard both of you;
you're both to blame.

41:44.999 --> 41:46.999
- I'm sorry, spitting--
I'm sorry, spitting on someone,

41:46.999 --> 41:48.000
let alone a girl,
is wrong.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.999
- Jax, I don't care.
- Okay.

41:49.999 --> 41:51.999
- You're competing--
- Don't come into my restaurant.

41:51.999 --> 41:52.999
- It's not your restaurant.
- Yes, it is.

41:52.999 --> 41:54.999
- It's my restaurant.

41:54.999 --> 41:55.999
For God's sake,
just pull yourself together,

41:55.999 --> 41:57.999
and nothing that you're saying
is more important

41:57.999 --> 41:58.999
than those kids out there.

41:58.999 --> 42:00.000
- This was heaven.
This dish is heaven.

42:00.999 --> 42:01.999
- Maybe we can--
- You know what I mean?

42:01.999 --> 42:02.999
- You guys okay?

42:02.999 --> 42:04.999
How come you and Jax
are, like, yelling back here?

42:04.999 --> 42:05.999
- f***--
he's talking around,

42:05.999 --> 42:07.999
saying that I'm spitting
on girls.

42:07.999 --> 42:09.999
He doesn't know what
the hell he's talking about.

42:09.999 --> 42:10.999
This guy is a f***ing prat.

42:10.999 --> 42:12.999
"You're spitting on girls;
you're gonna have problems."

42:12.999 --> 42:14.999
Get the f***--get your
f***ing steroid face

42:14.999 --> 42:15.999
out the f*** of my face.

42:15.999 --> 42:17.000
- Just calm down, James.

42:17.999 --> 42:19.999
- James, if you don't
change your attitude,

42:19.999 --> 42:20.999
you will actually go home.

42:20.999 --> 42:23.999
- Jax is just such
a piece of crap person.

42:23.999 --> 42:24.999
- Don't fall apart now.

42:24.999 --> 42:25.999
Why are you letting
him get to you?

42:25.999 --> 42:27.999
- I'm not going to.
- Will you just calm down?

42:27.999 --> 42:29.000
- I just want to go outside
and smoke one cigarette, please.

42:29.999 --> 42:31.999
- Go on; go take
a five-minute break.

42:31.999 --> 42:32.999
Keep an eye on them.

42:32.999 --> 42:33.999
Make sure they go
in opposite directions.

42:33.999 --> 42:34.999
- Okay.

42:36.999 --> 42:39.999
- Next time
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:39.999 --> 42:43.999
- The most epic
adult kids party ever.

42:43.999 --> 42:44.999
- We're going to Vegas.

42:44.999 --> 42:45.999
- Ready to have some fun?

42:45.999 --> 42:46.999
- I'm here to f*** sh** up.

42:46.999 --> 42:47.999
- Oh, sh**.

42:47.999 --> 42:49.999
Ah!

42:52.999 --> 42:53.999
- Hey!

42:53.999 --> 42:54.999
- You're welcome, America.

42:54.999 --> 42:56.999
- I cannot believe
in a million years

42:56.999 --> 42:59.999
that you two would
let them go to Vegas.

42:59.999 --> 43:00.999
- You guys kiss.

43:00.999 --> 43:01.999
I'm gonna make your boyfriends

43:01.999 --> 43:02.999
really jealous right now.

43:02.999 --> 43:03.999
- Oh, damn.

43:03.999 --> 43:05.999
- Oh, that's really hot.

43:05.999 --> 43:08.000
- I can't have sex,
and I want it now.

43:08.999 --> 43:12.999
- Let's ruin everything by,
like, trying to f*** girls.

43:12.999 --> 43:15.999
- To see more of
