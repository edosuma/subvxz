00:06.471 --> 00:07.882
She killed Sharon.

00:08.179 --> 00:09.562
I need a phone.

00:09.568 --> 00:12.187
Kosta. She's got a phone, she
was usin' it for fight club.

00:12.193 --> 00:15.088
- Right. Can you source it?
- Reckon I can source it.

00:16.145 --> 00:18.433
I haven't slept. I haven't
slept since Ferguson.

00:18.439 --> 00:20.212

Well, Marshal, you should ask Liz
about that. She knows all about it.

You gave evidence at my
trial. Who put you up to that?

00:32.491 --> 00:34.193
- D-Don.
- Detective Don Kaplan.

Why would I butcher Gilmour?

Still haven't told us
why you're protecting

05:02.388 --> 05:04.775
- a fuckin' lagger.
- Shut the fuck up, Kosta.

Actually, I think we
can help each other.

05:49.053 --> 05:53.373
There's a logical reason Kaz
didn't punish Liz Birdsworth:

05:53.622 --> 05:55.661
she's a lagger herself.

05:56.164 --> 06:00.668
Don't you remember when Will Jackson
interrupted her fight with Kosta?

06:00.731 --> 06:02.546
She's his informant.

06:02.552 --> 06:05.231
Haven't you noticed their
private little chats?

06:05.237 --> 06:06.923
And if I'm not mistaken,

06:06.929 --> 06:11.541
Kaz is the only person
standing between you and Allie.

06:12.946 --> 06:14.734
Look, if we work together,

06:14.740 --> 06:18.239
we can expose Kaz for
the hypocrite that she is.

06:18.656 --> 06:19.856
How?

06:19.862 --> 06:23.337
By forcing her to punish
someone she really cares about...

06:23.560 --> 06:24.792
(HUSHED) Allie.

06:25.078 --> 06:26.534
Well, she won't go through with it.

06:26.540 --> 06:29.063
She'll tip off Mr Jackson,
and when he intervenes,

06:29.069 --> 06:31.197
she'll be publicly exposed.

06:32.149 --> 06:35.757
- I won't risk Allie being hurt.
- It'll never happen, that's my point.

06:36.032 --> 06:37.669

06:37.721 --> 06:41.420
Kaz will lose all remaining
respect from the women.

06:41.610 --> 06:43.332
She will be deposed.

06:43.712 --> 06:45.030

06:45.036 --> 06:47.509
If I'm wrong, and that's a big if,

06:48.101 --> 06:51.807
then Kaz will have
punished her best friend.

06:54.172 --> 06:58.942

a warm shoulder to cry on.

07:17.184 --> 07:20.158
the fatigue, the
confusion, disorientation.

07:21.824 --> 07:24.523
I-I have a disease. I'm not crazy.

your symptoms will increase,

08:04.763 --> 08:07.358
but you'll also have periods of
lucidity, at least for a few months...

08:07.364 --> 08:08.603

08:08.604 --> 08:09.842
how to make you more comfortable here,

08:09.848 --> 08:11.360
but eventually you have to move

- to a psychiatric facility.

08:14.561 --> 08:15.761

- Hey, you look at me.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.301
Now, you get back on the phones,

08:53.307 --> 08:55.389

has tipped off the cops.

it is, I want them shut down.

they know you were using it?

- KOSTA: Do ya reckon she'll fight?
- Nah.

09:05.947 --> 09:10.237
- They could be tapping that skank.
- Yeah, and she's some prized target.

09:10.243 --> 09:12.146
And the Russians are
probably tapping her, too.

09:12.152 --> 09:15.956
- Who the fuck asked you?
- Either way, we can't have the cops listening in.

09:16.069 --> 09:18.850
- We could, um, bring in another phone.
- Nah, we can't risk that.

09:18.856 --> 09:20.742
We just need to lay
low, let the dust settle.

09:20.748 --> 09:21.948

- KOSTA: She doesn't have it in her.
- No, that's OK.

I think I might have
one last use for that.

09:57.166 --> 09:59.665

09:59.671 --> 10:02.197
I have tried to broach it
with the prisoner concerned,

10:02.203 --> 10:03.753

10:04.236 --> 10:05.727

10:06.419 --> 10:08.344
You want me to talk her into going

10:08.350 --> 10:10.313
- to psych unit?
- The doctor thinks it's best.

10:10.319 --> 10:12.615
That doctor doesn't know
her, he's covering his arse.

10:12.621 --> 10:15.113
I mean, it's still so early. If...

10:15.208 --> 10:18.600
She needs familiar
surroundings and faces

10:18.606 --> 10:20.510
or she's gonna get worse a lot quicker.

10:20.516 --> 10:23.048

herself or to the other women.

10:23.054 --> 10:24.657
Not with me looking out for her.

10:25.046 --> 10:27.975

there until you have to.

- Hey, back off.
- She's a thief.

it then. I didn't take it.

ANNOUNCER: Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

12:59.065 --> 13:00.754
Work unit will commence
in ten minutes...

13:00.760 --> 13:03.460
- We'll sort this in the laundry...
- Work unit will commence in ten minutes.

13:03.466 --> 13:05.673
- after work unit.
- Good.

13:22.082 --> 13:23.282
Kaz?

13:25.194 --> 13:26.915
- I'll see you after work unit.
- Yeah.

13:27.345 --> 13:29.945
No toast or knives.

13:31.052 --> 13:32.644
- This is bullshit.
- Hurry up!

13:32.650 --> 13:34.065
I didn't take that phone.

13:37.853 --> 13:39.053
I believe you.

13:39.059 --> 13:40.789
So what's happening after work unit?

13:40.795 --> 13:43.610
You just told everybody that
you were going to sort it.

13:43.616 --> 13:45.213
You're gonna have to trust
me. Whatever happens in there,

13:45.219 --> 13:46.689
you play along, OK?

13:46.876 --> 13:50.016
- Play along with what?
- Allie, everything is going to be OK.

13:50.022 --> 13:51.722
I am not gonna hurt you.

13:52.627 --> 13:54.038
I promise.

14:01.643 --> 14:02.843
Oi.

14:02.944 --> 14:04.647
Did you have anything to do with that?

14:04.653 --> 14:05.853
What?

14:06.054 --> 14:07.504
You wanted that phone.

14:08.432 --> 14:10.738
- So, what, did you set Allie up?
- No!

14:10.744 --> 14:13.051
Oh, so it's a big fuckin'
coincidence, then, huh?

14:13.057 --> 14:15.634
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Who'd ya get it for?

14:15.640 --> 14:17.014
Your boss?

14:17.324 --> 14:18.935
Right, I'll go talk to her.

14:19.685 --> 14:21.777
You don't talk to Marie about this, OK?

14:21.783 --> 14:25.063
You don't talk to Marie
about anything. I mean it!

14:25.069 --> 14:27.473
Stay away from her.

14:28.763 --> 14:29.963
OK.

14:35.900 --> 14:38.493
Oh, er, er, Mr Jackson...

14:38.499 --> 14:41.385
Is that Don, uh, Detective Don Kaplan?

14:41.391 --> 14:43.458
No, he's the workman fixing
the heating on the roof.

14:48.984 --> 14:52.270
Warm sheets, anyone? They're toasty.

14:52.969 --> 14:54.198
All mine, then.

14:55.872 --> 14:57.487
This is fucked.

14:57.493 --> 14:59.261
Kaz is supposed to be your friend.

14:59.267 --> 15:01.224
I guess she has to be
seen to do something.

15:01.230 --> 15:02.532
You were set up.

15:02.538 --> 15:05.075
Why the hell aren't you
freaking out about this?

15:13.575 --> 15:16.289
Oi! Pick up the pace.

15:16.408 --> 15:19.281
Don't you roll your
eyes! That's very rude.

15:19.287 --> 15:22.272
In a few days' time, she
will be running this place,

15:22.278 --> 15:25.299
so I want you to listen to
every single word she says.

15:25.305 --> 15:27.391
Bit of respect, bitches!

15:27.397 --> 15:29.184
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

15:29.190 --> 15:32.234
- Finally, she cracked a smile.
- Oh...

15:32.240 --> 15:34.400
Ooh... no, I'm going to miss ya, 'ey?

15:34.406 --> 15:36.499
I've grown very fond of you too, Susan.

15:36.505 --> 15:38.289
- You know that?
- Yeah.

15:38.933 --> 15:41.839
- You're gonna come visit, but, 'ey? Mmm.
- All the time.

15:41.845 --> 15:46.556
But while I'm still here,
I need you to stay close.

15:46.747 --> 15:48.154
- Why?
- Well...

15:48.160 --> 15:50.238
someone might get
jealous about my release.

15:50.244 --> 15:52.180
- Try and hurt me.
- Nah!

15:52.186 --> 15:55.278
- Nah, no-one's gonna touch ya.
- No, I think they might.

15:55.284 --> 15:59.180
I'd just really appreciate it if
you could keep me company, yes?

15:59.186 --> 16:00.965
- All... all right. All right.
- Yes.

16:00.971 --> 16:02.481
Hey! Hey...

16:02.764 --> 16:04.641
- What's Don doin' here?
- What?

16:04.647 --> 16:06.743
- He's workin' on the roof.
- BOOMER: Hey!

16:06.749 --> 16:09.457
What are you doin' in here?
Get back to your seedlings!

16:09.463 --> 16:11.974
I'm... I saw him. I'm sure it's him.

16:11.980 --> 16:13.238
- Liz...
- What?

16:13.244 --> 16:16.122
your boyfriend has been arrested,

16:16.128 --> 16:20.008
which is why, in a few days'
time, I will be a free woman

16:20.014 --> 16:22.512
and you will be stuck in here,

16:22.644 --> 16:25.954
brain dissolving like an aspirin.

16:43.635 --> 16:46.323
_

16:49.120 --> 16:50.320
Hey.

16:54.251 --> 16:55.672
Hey, I'm kind of busy.

16:55.678 --> 16:58.277
I need you to interrupt something
in the laundry after work unit.

16:58.545 --> 16:59.745
What's happened?

16:59.751 --> 17:02.887
Someone's framed Allie and it
needs to look like I'll punish her.

17:03.568 --> 17:04.997
You have to stop it.

17:32.857 --> 17:34.158
ANNOUNCER: Attention, H Block.

17:34.164 --> 17:37.944
Work unit is now complete.
Work unit is now complete.

17:55.836 --> 17:57.074
You OK?

17:57.627 --> 17:58.967
Uh, yeah.

18:00.056 --> 18:02.880
Could... uh, could you check on
that workman? It's bloody freezing.

18:07.151 --> 18:09.050
All right, let's do this.

18:09.056 --> 18:11.728
- I want that bitch punished.
- This is crazy. She didn't do...

18:11.921 --> 18:15.220
- Why aren't you fighting this?!
- (WHISPERED) Kaz can't do anything.

18:15.919 --> 18:18.370
INMATE: Oh, yeah...
she's gonna be punished...

18:18.376 --> 18:20.433
- INMATE 1: Shit.
- INMATE 2: What the fuck is that?

18:24.979 --> 18:27.082
- ANNOUNCER: Attention, compound. Attention, compound.
- INMATE: ...this is shit!

18:27.088 --> 18:28.965
Remain where you are until power is

18:28.971 --> 18:31.084
- restored. Remain where you are
- Just a power cut. Get on with it!

18:31.090 --> 18:33.273
until power is restored.

18:44.901 --> 18:46.101
(HUSHED) It's OK.

18:52.264 --> 18:56.050
Uh, Maintenance, this is Si
