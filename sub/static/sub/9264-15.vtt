Be honest with yourself
for two seconds

00:06.010 --> 00:08.410
and tell me that you don't feel
the way I feel about you.

00:08.570 --> 00:11.256
I don't feel the way you feel
about me. Move on.

00:11.516 --> 00:13.466
- Your friend left.
- Are you trying to say

00:13.726 --> 00:16.093
he just started wheeling
on down the road?

00:17.230 --> 00:19.514
- You really saved my ass tonight.
- No problem.

00:21.985 --> 00:23.735
You leave my sister alone.

00:24.279 --> 00:26.187
<i>Smash Williams is
an arrogant violent thug </i>

00:26.447 --> 00:28.189

00:28.449 --> 00:30.692
They've decided
to suspend you for three games.

00:30.952 --> 00:32.652
They're revoking my scholarship.

00:32.912 --> 00:34.279
That's the mark of death.

00:34.540 --> 00:36.363
The best thing
you can do for me is win.

00:36.803 --> 00:38.950

Hey, give me some money.

01:05.331 --> 01:07.019
- What?
- Give me some now.

01:08.015 --> 01:09.978
- Hey, Lyla.
- Hi, Billy.

Mr. Powers, Brian Williams.

01:57.747 --> 02:00.170
Just following up to see
if you got my other messages.

02:00.330 --> 02:02.763
Like I said,
my position with TMU is changing,

02:02.923 --> 02:05.505
and I'm feeling like
rolling with the tide.

02:05.665 --> 02:06.967
Call me, okay?

02:18.382 --> 02:21.302
For this car, everything you're getting,
is the invoice price,

02:21.562 --> 02:22.625
direct to dealer.

02:22.785 --> 02:25.432
And I swear to you, sir.
This is the absolute best I can do.

02:25.798 --> 02:28.018
No, I appreciate.
It sounds like a good deal.

02:28.278 --> 02:31.855
I'm just trying to knock
something off here. There's got to be...

02:32.766 --> 02:34.758
All right, you know what?
You think about it,

02:34.918 --> 02:36.943
and I'll be back
in a couple minutes, okay?

02:41.632 --> 02:43.733
- Hello, miss.
- Hello, sir.

02:44.095 --> 02:46.038
This is the 2008 fully loaded,
you know?

02:46.198 --> 02:49.456
If you're actually looking I could
probably get you a pretty good deal.

02:49.867 --> 02:52.067
I'm not shopping for a car,
but thank you.

02:52.227 --> 02:54.294
I know.
I was just playing around.

02:54.747 --> 02:56.754
Sorry I haven't called you back.

02:57.015 --> 03:00.974
That's been a bit much.
It's ten calls, ten messages.

03:01.134 --> 03:02.802
No call back.
What's up with that?

03:03.200 --> 03:05.138
I didn't know what to do.
I mean...

03:05.398 --> 03:06.841
I probably called too much.

03:07.001 --> 03:10.165
I don't really know what the rules
are either in this exact situation.

03:10.325 --> 03:13.314
I guess it's a one-night thing,
and I probably called too many times...

03:13.474 --> 03:15.324
- Jason...
- How you been?

03:15.558 --> 03:16.741
I'm pregnant.

03:22.556 --> 03:23.918
That's impossible.

04:12.201 --> 04:13.896
- I want the parking lot.
- You got it.

04:14.056 --> 04:17.500
I'm gonna trust you on that. You oughta
get it done for what we're paying.

04:17.762 --> 04:18.704
No way!

04:19.161 --> 04:20.380
Is that Mo?

04:20.540 --> 04:21.923
Holy cow!
Who's that?

04:22.183 --> 04:23.770
What are you doing here?

04:23.930 --> 04:25.510
You look absolutely gorgeous.

04:26.087 --> 04:28.179
- Hi, honey.
- Oh, baby, you look so...

04:28.941 --> 04:30.706
- Who's this?
- This is Gracie belle.

04:30.866 --> 04:32.350
- Who's baby?
- That's my baby.

04:32.610 --> 04:35.069
How are you, honey?
What in the world are you doing here?

04:35.229 --> 04:38.356
- Dallas and... all real estate.
- Really?

04:38.616 --> 04:40.692
You're gonna...
Were you buying the <i>Bell's</i> ?

04:40.952 --> 04:42.110
Yeah, think so.

04:42.608 --> 04:43.766
Yeah, I think maybe.

04:43.926 --> 04:46.400
We're looking at shopping
centers all over the state.

04:46.560 --> 04:49.199
- Is that right?
- This is Reeves. Come here.

04:49.667 --> 04:52.446
This was the reigning
rankin high school

04:52.606 --> 04:55.066
- homecoming queen, 198...
- All right, enough of that.

04:55.226 --> 04:56.995
We don't need to tell him
what year it was.

04:57.155 --> 04:59.627
This is Reeves, and he's a good man.
I give him a hard time.

04:59.887 --> 05:02.911
- We were high school sweethearts.
- Go get the car.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.215
Your husband won
a State championship.

05:05.476 --> 05:06.593
Yes, we did.

05:06.853 --> 05:09.512
- Are you working?
- Working at the school.

05:09.672 --> 05:11.000
You teachin'?

05:11.160 --> 05:13.183
I'm counseling the kids.
Which has been great.

05:13.583 --> 05:15.226
The boys must love you.

05:15.941 --> 05:17.562
Mo, you are too funny.

05:17.894 --> 05:20.899
- What are you doing tomorrow night?
- I'm home with the family.

05:21.159 --> 05:23.109
We're doing a charity thing
at the hospital.

05:23.369 --> 05:25.941
- Would you guys come?
- Yeah, it's at the hospital?

05:26.101 --> 05:27.780
- Yeah.
- I'll check with him.

05:28.040 --> 05:30.430
It would be an honor to have
a Texas high school coach...

05:30.590 --> 05:32.374
Champion coach at our event.

05:32.534 --> 05:34.897
Tell him I want him to come.
Invite him for me.

05:41.512 --> 05:44.422
Why aren't you out there? Your
suspension doesn't cover this thing.

05:44.682 --> 05:45.990
- It does today.
- Do it?

05:46.150 --> 05:48.926
Yeah. Besides,
I hated this game since the fifth grade.

06:11.083 --> 06:13.565
- How you doing, Brian?
- Doin'okay, coach.

06:13.836 --> 06:15.470
- Hangin'in.
- Good.

06:15.630 --> 06:16.785
It's all good.

06:17.926 --> 06:19.658
I've been talking to some people.

06:19.818 --> 06:21.953
Alabama, Georgia, Miami.

06:22.811 --> 06:23.711
Good.

06:24.972 --> 06:27.298
Matt, you're out!
Get out of there!

06:27.558 --> 06:28.546
Good.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.741
What a bitch!

06:37.689 --> 06:38.946
It's not like that.

06:40.621 --> 06:42.032
It's not like that?

06:42.192 --> 06:44.916
Let me guess. She come and get
some cash for the abortion.

06:45.076 --> 06:46.566
- That's what she want.
- No,

06:46.726 --> 06:48.694
she doesn't want money
for the abortion.

06:48.854 --> 06:51.285
I knew I shouldn't have said
anything to you, man.

06:51.445 --> 06:54.322
I can never talk to you serious
about anything 'cause you're an idiot.

06:54.482 --> 06:56.654
Am I?
Am I? I'm an idiot?

06:56.814 --> 06:58.413
- Yeah.
- Okay, put it this way.

06:58.673 --> 07:01.785
You go out and finally get yourself
a slice of y-bone steak,

07:01.945 --> 07:04.256
and lo and behold,
she shows up pregnant.

07:04.416 --> 07:06.904
And when she comes to tell you,
you're not even pissed off.

07:07.064 --> 07:08.673
- Why would I...
- "Why, why... "

07:08.933 --> 07:12.112
You can't even take one step back
to ask yourself one serious question.

07:12.272 --> 07:13.636
Well what's that, Herc?

07:14.312 --> 07:16.601
- This kid even yours?
- Of course I asked her!

07:16.761 --> 07:18.683
I'm the only one
she's been with in 2 months.

07:18.943 --> 07:22.186
- The only one she's been with?
- Yeah, the only guy she's been with.

07:22.446 --> 07:25.481
Well how about a rubber, dude?
You ever think about wearing a rubber?

07:25.741 --> 07:28.113
- Wrap that puppy, man.
- I didn't exactly think about it,

07:28.273 --> 07:30.528
'cause everybody told me
that this wasn't possible.

07:30.788 --> 07:32.363
So no, I didn't "wrap that puppy."

07:32.839 --> 07:36.783
And if it happened, and it's true,
and it's mine, then it's a miracle.

07:39.204 --> 07:40.204
All right?

07:43.123 --> 07:43.931
Fine.

07:46.088 --> 07:49.087
What are you gonna do
about this little miracle, Street?

07:50.243 --> 07:53.032
Nothing I can do.
She said it's her problem.

07:53.192 --> 07:54.791
She'll take care of it.

07:55.807 --> 07:57.487
She just wanted me to know.

08:02.486 --> 08:06.052
We got South Pines tonight,
7:30, Herrmann field home game.

08:06.537 --> 08:08.720
<i>Uh, yeah,
we should win by 40 or more.</i>

08:08.880 --> 08:12.027
- What's he doing in our studio?
- He's auditioning.

08:13.168 --> 08:15.740
- For what?
- He wanna do a talk show about sports.

08:16.454 --> 08:19.284
It's not a bad idea.
I wish I would've thought of it.

08:23.898 --> 08:25.958
- Guess who I ran into today.
- Who?

08:26.350 --> 08:29.504
Walking right out of <i>Bell's</i>,
I was on my way to daycare,

08:29.764 --> 08:31.308
bumped right on into him.

08:31.468 --> 08:32.256
Who?

08:34.268 --> 08:36.719
- Mo McArnold.
- Who's Mo McArnold?

08:36.979 --> 08:38.589
Why's Mo McArnold in town?

08:38.749 --> 08:40.732
He's here buying up real estate.

08:40.893 --> 08:42.750
"Real estate",
like a house or what?

08:42.909 --> 08:45.279
No, he's buying
a whole shopping center.

08:45.439 --> 08:47.438
Apparently
he's a big mogul now or something.

08:47.698 --> 08:48.940
Who is Mo McArnold?

08:49.206 --> 08:52.192
Mo McArnold's an old boyfriend
of your mom's till I came along.

08:52.453 --> 08:55.148
Lucky for both of you,
the best man won.

08:55.308 --> 08:57.532
That's right, honey.
I'm your prize guernsey.

08:57.955 --> 08:59.283
That's right, baby.

09:00.188 --> 09:04.138
Wouldn't it be fun to see him?
'cause he invited us to go to this...

09:04.507 --> 09:08.209
hospital charity benefit tomorrow night.
Which I think could be kinda neat.

09:08.469 --> 09:11.169
He's all involved with it.
It's right over at the hospital.

09:11.431 --> 09:14.436
- Don't you think that'd be a neat idea?
- That'd be really nifty.

09:15.251 --> 09:17.552
Well I sorta thought
it would be nice.

09:17.919 --> 09:19.846
It's nice that he's in town
and everything.

09:20.106 --> 09:21.222
He'd like to see you.

09:21.482 --> 09:23.793
You could go without...
Don't think he wants to see me.

09:23.953 --> 09:26.814
- It's all water under the bridge.
- Water under the bridge...

09:26.974 --> 09:28.852
- It's been so long.
- He talks a lot.

09:29.012 --> 09:30.882
- He's always talking.
- I know! He does!

09:31.042 --> 09:34.213
He's got that crazy energy,
but it'd be fun.

09:34.373 --> 09:35.550
C'mon, hon.

09:38.499 --> 09:41.199
- Sure this is a good idea?
- Yes, it is.

09:41.359 --> 09:43.472
You've to put a face
in front of the customer.

09:43.632 --> 09:46.019
It's, like, the basic
fundamental of selling.

09:46.179 --> 09:48.736
This is crazy.
I'm used to them selling to me.

09:49.248 --> 09:50.750
Okay, listen to me.

09:51.265 --> 09:53.337
You are Smash Williams,

09:53.777 --> 09:57.008
star running back of
the State champion Dillon Panthers.

09:57.429 --> 09:59.827
You set conference records
in yards, rushing,

09:59.987 --> 10:02.054
and touchdowns scored
two years in a row.

10:02.850 --> 10:04.404
Remember who you are.

10:05.276 --> 10:06.826
Remember who you're gonna be.

10:06.986 --> 10:10.605
If they got a second chance to sign you,
then they're gonna be totally psyched.

10:11.070 --> 10:13.107
So go out there and do your thing.

10:13.694 --> 10:17.028
Because when you get back,
you're totally gonna get laid.

10:18.262 --> 10:19.155
For real?

10:19.822 --> 10:20.948
No, I'm pms-ing.

10:21.838 --> 10:24.202
But go! Come on,
get out of this car! Go!

10:24.811 --> 10:27.215
You're Smash williams,
don't forget that.

10:35.583 --> 10:36.589
Hey, Mr. Powers.

10:38.362 --> 10:40.717
- How you doing?
- Doing good. Good.

10:41.163 --> 10:42.345
I made a mistake.

10:42.907 --> 10:46.098
I got caught up in the moment, it was
a rash decision, but I changed my mind.

10:46.550 --> 10:49.100
I know TMU pulled
your scholarship, son.

10:49.487 --> 10:51.937
- Nice try though.
- Look, I run a 4.4 flat.

10:52.451 --> 10:55.649
I set conference records in yards
and touchdowns, two years in a row.

10:55.910 --> 10:57.317
Nobody's better in the state.

10:57.654 --> 10:59.598
Look, Mr. Powers,
I'm standing right here,

10:59.758 --> 11:02.698
and I'm telling you that Smash is ready
to come to Tuscaloosa.

11:03.195 --> 11:04.741
Problem is the spot's taken.

11:05.836 --> 11:07.285
You may be the best running back,

11:07.690 --> 11:09.846
but we got a verbal commitment
from Juette Coleman

11:10.006 --> 11:11.828
outta Christian Oaks in California.

11:11.988 --> 11:14.709
He oughta fit in real nicely
with this QB right here.

11:18.551 --> 11:19.742
Mr. Powers...

11:20.950 --> 11:23.553
Please.
What, you want me to beg?

11:23.813 --> 11:25.741
Look, I'm sorry
for your situation, Brian,

11:25.901 --> 11:28.015
but you turned us down, remember?

11:28.276 --> 11:31.018
- But like I said, it was a mistake.
- We honor our commitments.

11:31.278 --> 11:34.438
Juette Coleman is coming to Alabama,
and you're not gonna change that.

11:35.157 --> 11:38.368
To be quite honest,
we're the university of Alabama.

11:38.528 --> 11:40.527
We don't play
second fiddle to anybody.

11:42.749 --> 11:43.947
Good luck to you, Brian.

11:46.987 --> 11:48.786
Tell your mom I said hi.

11:49.989 --> 11:51.473
Hey you, number three.

12:27.469 --> 12:28.624
How you doing?

12:29.030 --> 12:31.663
- I'm all right. How are you?
- Pretty good.

12:32.439 --> 12:35.312
So, uh, you hear about
the premiere coming up?

12:35.472 --> 12:36.565
Premiere?

12:37.127 --> 12:38.127
Yeah, premiere.

12:38.629 --> 12:40.338
Sports, Riggs,

12:41.189 --> 12:42.130
radio.

12:43.087 --> 12:44.090
Congratulations.

12:44.790 --> 12:45.718
Thank you.

12:46.241 --> 12:47.302
You're welcome.

12:47.563 --> 12:48.721
How's the boy doing?

12:49.081 --> 12:50.431
- Good.
- Really?

12:51.554 --> 12:54.559
So good that he invited me to the ranch
this weekend and meet his family.

12:54.876 --> 12:57.313
Family ranch.
That's great.

12:57.690 --> 13:00.024
It's gonna be great,
you're not gonna be able to find us.

13:05.331 --> 13:07.197
- How was school today?
- It was fine.

13:07.459 --> 13:10.326
- Mr. And Mrs. Clarke.
- Sweetheart, do not wash that bowl,

13:10.587 --> 13:12.620
I have every intention
of licking it.

13:16.405 --> 13:18.376
Did you... did you, um,
did you hear?

13:19.461 --> 13:21.336
- Hear what?
- About me and Tyra?

13:21.905 --> 13:25.674
Oh, yes. I saw the two of you
holding hands. That was really cute.

13:26.044 --> 13:28.593
What happened to Jean?
I thought the two of you were, like...

13:28.753 --> 13:32.058
It's kind of a really long story.
It's kind of complicated.

13:32.218 --> 13:35.340
It's not as easy
as Tyra came into the situation.

13:35.841 --> 13:38.354
Okay, well...
Gimme something.

13:41.075 --> 13:43.608
I don't know,
but I'll tell you one thing.

13:44.181 --> 13:46.612
In, like, you know, the boudoir...

13:47.279 --> 13:51.283
Tyra does things
that I didn't even know...

13:51.543 --> 13:54.662
She probably knows what she's doing.
She's had some practice.

13:55.339 --> 13:57.367
It's not like you're her first...

13:58.082 --> 13:59.082
Or second.

13:59.466 --> 14:00.750
She was with Riggins.

14:01.012 --> 14:03.294
Now why would you bring
something like that up?

14:03.555 --> 14:05.811
- I know that she...
- I just didn't really realize

14:05.971 --> 14:07.675
that she was your type.

14:07.936 --> 14:10.257
Well, I don't know.
I mean, I didn't realize

14:10.417 --> 14:12.512
that a hot mexican nanny
was your type.

14:12.778 --> 14:14.806
Look, she's not a mexican,
and she's not a nanny.

14:14.966 --> 14:16.966
She's a guatemalan
in-home care nurse.

14:17.126 --> 14:19.185
I told you that, like,
a hundred times, okay?

14:19.591 --> 14:22.690
And she blew me off, just like Tyra's
gonna blow you off and take off

14:22.950 --> 14:26.985
back to whatever other cooler guy
comes along when you're... You know.

14:27.340 --> 14:30.923
But you don't have to worry about that
because we're gonna be okay.

15:02.191 --> 15:03.730
So I've been thinking...

15:04.130 --> 15:05.764
We should have this baby.

15:07.891 --> 15:09.862
I was up all night long
thinking about it, okay?

15:10.122 --> 15:12.971
I started reading stuff on the internet,
and this is a miracle.

15:13.131 --> 15:15.659
- It's a blessing from God.
- What are you talking about?

15:15.919 --> 15:19.532
Look, listen to me. I'm a C-7
incomplete quadriplegic, okay?

15:20.315 --> 15:22.969
I have a 20% motility rate.

15:23.129 --> 15:25.495
Most guys at my SCI do...

15:25.655 --> 15:28.296
Like a normal guy would have,
like, 80% motility rate.

15:28.570 --> 15:31.721
Even to get an erection with you,
had to go reflex instead of psychogenic,

15:31.881 --> 15:35.345
which you were great with by the way.
I just thought I'd tell you that quick.

15:35.505 --> 15:39.182
I didn't know I'd had enough duct
function to get sperm into the semen.

15:40.210 --> 15:42.645
Look, point is,
my boys can swim.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.147
Ever since this injury,
the worst thing

15:45.407 --> 15:47.969
has been people telling me
I wouldn't be able to be a father.

15:48.129 --> 15:49.679
But guess what?
I am.

15:49.953 --> 15:53.572
You need to stop,
and go home, and get some sleep,

15:54.213 --> 15:56.450
because you are freaking me out.

15:56.711 --> 15:59.078
We've to have this baby,
it might be my only chance.

16:00.942 --> 16:03.040
You do not get to put that on me.

16:03.380 --> 16:04.380
I mean...

16:04.898 --> 16:09.059
I'm not some experiment
for you to prove your manhood, Jason.

16:09.219 --> 16:10.219
I'm 19.

16:10.379 --> 16:12.987
You're a frickin' car salesman
in a wheelchair,

16:13.227 --> 16:15.468
- never been to college.
- That's not the point.

16:15.729 --> 16:17.790
It's absolutely the point, Jason.

16:18.906 --> 16:21.521
This is my body
and I'm going to make...

16:21.681 --> 16:23.810
I'm gonna make the ultimate decision.

16:25.556 --> 16:27.982
You were a one-night stand,
for God's sake.

16:29.073 --> 16:30.693
One of the greatest nights
of my life.

16:32.968 --> 16:34.943
- I gotta go.
- No, Erin, don't.

16:35.791 --> 16:37.037
Come on, don't...

16:43.180 --> 16:46.269
Hey, man, we're in Dallas this weekend,
Houston the next.

16:46.429 --> 16:48.669
It's open try-outs.
All you need is a pair of cleats.

16:49.118 --> 16:50.526
And 60 bucks.

16:51.037 --> 16:53.685
You expect me to pay to come
run around with a bunch of wannabes?

16:53.845 --> 16:56.242
Hey, man, Arena football's
the real deal, man.

16:56.402 --> 16:58.971
Kurt Warner played in our league
before the Rams picked him up.

16:59.649 --> 17:01.045
Come on, man.
I mean...

17:01.205 --> 17:04.602
Y'all are running around inside
on a tiny field with a bunch of ness.

17:04.974 --> 17:06.369
It's kind of a joke.

17:06.530 --> 17:08.355
We're a fan's game.
You're right about that.

17:08.968 --> 17:11.032
Average attendance is about 12,000.

17:11.306 --> 17:13.469
We just signed
our new TV deal with ESPN.

17:13.628 --> 17:16.230
Our guys are banking 42 grand a year

17:16.623 --> 17:18.741
for a 16-game season,
january to june.

17:19.441 --> 17:20.846
- For real?
- Yeah.

17:21.006 --> 17:24.037
Guy like you, come in, kick some ass,
become a franchise player.

17:24.567 --> 17:27.749
You could double that in three
or four years. Plus health and housing.

17:28.011 --> 17:29.334
You wanna play pro football?

17:30.192 --> 17:31.642
This is your chance.

17:34.005 --> 17:37.509
With the addition of this
state-of-the-art flying ambulance,

17:37.770 --> 17:40.532
and this wonderful heliport
you're all standing on,

17:40.800 --> 17:45.059
I'm proud to say that Dillon
Memorial Hospital is now officially

17:45.320 --> 17:48.312
a level one trauma care facility.

17:49.939 --> 17:52.871
And so, I'd like to ask
Mr. Morris McArnold,

17:53.031 --> 17:54.610
the man who made this all possible,

17:56.067 --> 17:59.469
to step forward and dedicate
this wonderful new aircraft.

17:59.629 --> 18:00.629
Morris.

18:01.690 --> 18:03.034
Thank you very much, Bob.

18:03.295 --> 18:05.406
Let me just say...
I'll keep this brief.

18:05.566 --> 18:07.998
As a third generation Dillon citizen,

18:08.342 --> 18:10.116
Dillon is in my heart,

18:10.621 --> 18:13.879
my family's heart.
So it's a privilege for us

18:14.140 --> 18:15.720
to be able to make this donation.

18:15.880 --> 18:18.057
God bless you all
and thank you very much.

18:25.893 --> 18:27.307
Good to see you.

18:27.467 --> 18:29.617
- Good event.
- Great to see you.

18:31.351 --> 18:32.856
There he is, there he is.

18:33.886 --> 18:35.359
- Eric.
- Mo, how are you?

18:36.014 --> 18:37.807
- Pleasure to see you.
- Pleasure's mine.

18:37.967 --> 18:40.150
Congratulations.
Let's start with this right away.

18:40.310 --> 18:42.699
State champion.
Congratulations. Proud of you.

18:42.960 --> 18:45.118
- We got lucky.
- Real proud of you.

18:45.379 --> 18:47.150
- Cheers. And to your daughter...
- Gracie.

18:47.310 --> 18:51.087
Gracie. What a beautiful girl.
What the hell's it been? 15?

18:51.247 --> 18:53.705
- It's been about 15.
- 15? Red light!

18:55.030 --> 18:56.088
Red light.

18:56.428 --> 18:58.595
- Red light!
- Green light, I gotcha.

18:58.755 --> 19:00.718
- Hasn't changed a bit, huh?
- Yeah.

19:01.472 --> 19:04.972
You two look great. You two look...
Not as great as this would look.

19:05.675 --> 19:08.088
- You know it looks good.
- She looks better every day.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.476
She sure does.

19:09.933 --> 19:12.438
They got me on a schedule,
so I'm gonna say good-bye for now.

19:12.698 --> 19:14.268
Are you gonna go up in the...

19:14.428 --> 19:16.562
- In the thing?
- I've got some pictures...

19:16.722 --> 19:19.862
But I'm gonna come to the game
on Friday night. I'm gonna be there.

19:20.675 --> 19:22.975
- So I wish you the best of luck.
- That's fantastic.

19:23.135 --> 19:25.534
- Baby, you look great.
- I'll get you some nice seats.

19:26.043 --> 19:27.713
- Get Mo some seats.
- Sit with me.

19:27.873 --> 19:31.112
I'd like that. Get me a seat,
we'll sit together at the game.

19:31.272 --> 19:33.292
We'll go to the game.
Thank you for coming.

19:33.552 --> 19:35.001
- Thanks.
- You got a good one.

19:35.262 --> 19:37.337
You bring 'em hell.
And you bring 'em hell.

19:37.813 --> 19:39.891
And you keep bringing them hell.
Gotcha.

19:40.051 --> 19:41.925
- Okay, let's go.
- Congratulations.

19:43.770 --> 19:45.637
Bye, take care.
So nice to see you.

19:48.564 --> 19:50.329
I sure haven't missed him.

19:52.068 --> 19:53.326
Blast from the past.

19:53.486 --> 19:56.982
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Morris McArnold will now take</i>

19:57.242 --> 20:00.030
<i>the inaugural flight
in our new medevac helicopter.</i>

20:02.537 --> 20:03.720
Here we go.

20:24.586 --> 20:26.399
This was not supposed to happen,
all right?

20:26.559 --> 20:28.817
I'm not supposed
to be able to do this.

20:29.876 --> 20:32.101
She shouldn't be pregnant from me.

20:32.808 --> 20:34.997
But she is, and...

20:35.599 --> 20:39.319
this might be my only shot,
so I am ready to be a father.

20:40.130 --> 20:41.580
You think I'm crazy.

20:41.878 --> 20:42.878
No.

20:43.872 --> 20:47.033
- You're looking at me like I'm crazy.
- I've heard this conversation before.

20:47.193 --> 20:49.733
Usually it's the other way around.
It's a scared kid trying...

20:49.893 --> 20:51.348
To get out of it.
That's not me.

20:51.508 --> 20:53.785
I'm not trying to get out of it,
but to get into it.

20:53.945 --> 20:55.195
I'm trying to...

20:55.816 --> 20:58.293
get her to listen to me
and have this baby.

20:58.453 --> 21:01.046
And the first time I talked to her,
I failed miserably.

21:01.538 --> 21:03.469
First of all,
I don't have magic words for you.

21:03.629 --> 21:06.470
It's not for me to convince her,
it's to you to find those words.

21:06.630 --> 21:08.992
It's gonna probably be
the most serious conversation

21:09.152 --> 21:11.387
- you'll ever have in your life.
- I know.

21:16.606 --> 21:17.855
I can tell you

21:18.379 --> 21:21.899
that your children
and the mother of your children

21:22.263 --> 21:24.871
are the two most important things
in life.

21:26.417 --> 21:28.691
- How old are you?
- I'm 19.

21:29.192 --> 21:30.442
How old is she?

21:31.410 --> 21:32.410
She's 19.

21:32.880 --> 21:35.192
- How long you known her?
- Not long.

21:36.252 --> 21:38.124
She's a...
She's a great girl.

21:39.444 --> 21:41.674
She's just scared, you know?

21:41.834 --> 21:44.094
I know that and I understand that.

21:44.763 --> 21:45.763
I just...

21:46.269 --> 21:49.725
Everything I know about women you could
stick in this damn coffee cup here.

21:49.885 --> 21:52.722
But I do know
you have to have trust and honesty.

21:52.984 --> 21:56.431
Without trust and honesty,
it is not gonna work.

21:59.326 --> 22:01.276
I can't give you any answers.

22:01.669 --> 22:03.192
You gotta make the answers.

22:04.260 --> 22:05.260
I know.

22:07.638 --> 22:08.638
Thank you.

22:11.543 --> 22:14.995
This is the Rigg Show.
We got a game tonight, South Pines.

22:15.255 --> 22:17.433
Let's talk football,
about what's really happening.

22:17.593 --> 22:18.999
Go ahead, you're on the air.

22:19.416 --> 22:22.002
<i>I wanna know what it is
that you're gonna do to contribute</i>

22:22.711 --> 22:26.014
<i>to the salvation
of this championship season.</i>

22:26.174 --> 22:29.342
Know what? I'll tell you right now.
My character has never been questioned.

22:29.604 --> 22:31.469
So if you've ever been
to a game live,

22:32.441 --> 22:35.432
you will understand
how I do what I do and why.

22:35.872 --> 22:37.559
Man, this town
is crazy about football.

22:38.339 --> 22:40.940
Actually, that's maybe
the second call he got about it.

22:41.100 --> 22:43.707
The rest were girls
just trying to get a date.

22:43.867 --> 22:44.941
Let's do it, cheers.

22:45.387 --> 22:46.443
Lorena.

22:46.703 --> 22:49.467
<i>I was wondering if you wanted
to maybe hang out or catch a movie.</i>

22:49.627 --> 22:50.948
<i>I think you're really cute.</i>

22:51.824 --> 22:53.867
<i>Your long hair
kind of reminds me of Jesus.</i>

22:54.328 --> 22:55.852
You've just been cut off.

22:56.012 --> 22:58.038
Thank you for calling,
that was ridiculous.

22:58.823 --> 23:01.100
Lucky Lauren, let's go.
You're on the air with Riggs.

23:01.260 --> 23:04.307
<i>Hi, I was wondering what you think
about the whole Smash Williams incident.</i>

23:04.467 --> 23:05.485
And what about it?

23:05.645 --> 23:08.798
<i>I was wondering if you think it's okay
what he did, punching that man.</i>

23:09.162 --> 23:12.969
You know what? I know Williams
probably better than anyone out there.

23:13.231 --> 23:17.068
This guy is an honorable guy and he did
take action on something, you know,

23:17.228 --> 23:19.600
that I would've probably taken
even further if it were me.

23:19.861 --> 23:21.894
<i>So you're saying it's okay
to hit somebody?</i>

23:22.447 --> 23:24.443
At times, yeah, I am.

23:25.085 --> 23:26.607
We're gonna close this out now.

23:27.072 --> 23:30.346
No regrets, 7:30 tonight South Pines.
Same old, same old.

23:30.506 --> 23:33.457
We're gonna get a big W tonight,
head into the playoffs and take State.

23:33.617 --> 23:34.992
That's it for now.
Cheers.

23:39.327 --> 23:42.457
- Felt good.
- Yeah, man, not bad at all. Good work.

23:42.940 --> 23:44.834
Man, can I talk to you for a second?

23:45.095 --> 23:46.095
Yeah, shoot.

23:46.255 --> 23:48.462
I know you like Lyla
and you're doing this show

23:48.724 --> 23:51.424
to try and get under my skin.
I wanna let you know it won't work.

23:51.685 --> 23:53.093
Why would I try to do that?

23:53.353 --> 23:55.056
She's over you.
I wanted to let you know.

23:55.216 --> 23:57.371
That's all I wanted to say to you
out of courtesy.

23:57.531 --> 23:58.431
Okay?

23:58.830 --> 24:01.476
Thanks, man, good luck tonight.
We'll listen to you on the radio.

24:01.912 --> 24:04.895
Do you think she's gonna be thinking
of me or you while you listen to me?

24:05.157 --> 24:07.815
- She's gonna be with me, so.
- You're not letting it register.

24:08.077 --> 24:09.401
- Go Panthers.
- Cheers.

24:12.885 --> 24:13.885
Come in.

24:14.623 --> 24:17.102
- Hey, coach. You wanted to see me?
- I do. Come in.

24:17.262 --> 24:19.012
Sit down. Close the door.

24:22.249 --> 24:25.537
I don't know what you planned tomorrow,
but I want you to change it.

24:25.697 --> 24:28.253
- Come down to Whitmore with me.
- For what?

24:29.450 --> 24:30.500
Scholarship.

24:31.289 --> 24:33.819
Coach Deeks.
The offer is still good.

24:33.979 --> 24:34.979
Whitmore?

24:36.190 --> 24:37.325
That's like Siberia...

24:37.485 --> 24:40.848
It's a damn fine school, first of all,
and they got a good coaching staff.

24:41.109 --> 24:43.944
- They were 2 and 8 last year.
- Whitmore is one of the only schools

24:44.104 --> 24:48.564
that is still standing behind you after
this mess you've gotten yourself into.

24:48.937 --> 24:50.819
You think that accounts for something?

24:50.979 --> 24:52.519
- Yeah, but I...
- Yeah, but what?

24:52.679 --> 24:56.445
An airplane's waiting for you tomorrow
to take you off to Lsu or Alabama maybe?

24:56.605 --> 24:58.199
Something I don't know about?

24:58.540 --> 25:00.848
Is that what you're gonna be
doing tomorrow?

25:01.979 --> 25:04.373
- No, sir.
- You didn't listen to me last time.

25:04.979 --> 25:07.829
I'm asking you
to please listen to me this time.

25:08.601 --> 25:11.132
Two years, maybe you'll transfer.
Hell, who knows?

25:11.292 --> 25:14.132
You might be their first player
in ten years to make it to the draft.

25:15.032 --> 25:17.375
Coach Deeks seems to think
that's a possibility.

25:17.535 --> 25:18.594
Hell, I do too.

25:19.094 --> 25:21.890
You live up to your potential,
I don't see why it couldn't happen.

25:22.552 --> 25:23.927
Just think about it.

25:25.478 --> 25:27.823
Get back to me
before the night's over.

25:28.595 --> 25:29.397
Thanks.

25:30.352 --> 25:31.702
I'll let you know.

25:44.742 --> 25:48.162
<i>South Pines hasn't been able
to stop the Dillon offense.</i>

25:48.322 --> 25:51.261
<i>Tim Riggins goes in for the score.</i>

25:55.225 --> 25:56.518
<i>It's fourth quarter</i>

25:56.678 --> 25:59.177
<i>and looking like it's an easy win
for the Panthers tonight.</i>

26:00.607 --> 26:02.888
Good team!
That boy's got a good team.

26:03.149 --> 26:05.682
Second offense, let's go!
On me, let's go!

26:06.348 --> 26:08.603
Listen up.
Wave, say hello to your folks,

26:09.507 --> 26:11.552
let's get out there
and let's kick some ass.

26:11.712 --> 26:14.024
Come on, let's have some fun.
Let's go!

26:14.286 --> 26:15.288
Let's go!

26:16.427 --> 26:17.695
This oughta be good!

26:21.725 --> 26:23.785
<i>31 to nothing.
It looks like coach Taylor</i>

26:24.045 --> 26:26.204
<i>is mercifully sending in
some second stringers.</i>

26:26.464 --> 26:27.746
What you got for us?

26:28.008 --> 26:29.665
All right.
Hey, it's third down.

26:29.927 --> 26:32.548
Landry, you wanna show Tyra
what you can do?

26:32.708 --> 26:34.211
- Yeah.
- Here's the deal.

26:34.472 --> 26:37.256
Three in a pass formation,
it's gonna be tossed back to Landry.

26:37.518 --> 26:39.068
On one, ready?
Break!

26:40.603 --> 26:41.887
Make something happen!

26:45.939 --> 26:47.517
Blue 80!
Hut!

26:50.905 --> 26:52.666
<i>Saracen's rolling out.</i>

26:53.929 --> 26:55.734
<i>It's a jump pass to 85!</i>

26:56.427 --> 27:00.350
<i>Landry Clarke has got it,
and oh, he's got open field!</i>

27:00.510 --> 27:02.047
<i>He's gonna score.</i>

27:02.333 --> 27:05.594
<i>Touchdown,
Dillon Panthers once again!</i>

27:05.754 --> 27:09.552
<i>And this has turned into
an old fashion whopping.</i>

27:10.704 --> 27:11.712
Who's that?

27:15.102 --> 27:16.795
That's my baby boy!

27:17.678 --> 27:20.592
<i>That end zone's been opened
all night long,</i>

27:20.852 --> 27:24.137
<i>and Landry just walked in,
untouched!</i>

27:29.482 --> 27:31.637
<i>45 to nothing
with eight seconds to play.</i>

27:31.797 --> 27:33.197
<i>The only drama here</i>

27:33.357 --> 27:36.815
<i>is whether South Pines can put
one in before this night is over.</i>

27:40.872 --> 27:44.615
<i>Hold on, something's up. Coach Taylor
is calling for a change on defense.</i>

27:45.157 --> 27:47.285
- You're giving them the middle.
- <i>They open up</i>

27:47.545 --> 27:50.580
<i>a hole big enough for a semi.
Here's the snap.</i>

27:51.293 --> 27:54.668
<i>And he waltzes into the end zone.
Touchdown!</i>

27:54.929 --> 27:57.306
<i>It's been a long hard night
for South Pines,</i>

27:57.466 --> 28:00.182
<i>and our coach Taylor
has lifted their spirits.</i>

28:00.342 --> 28:02.592
<i>And he sends them home with a score.</i>

28:04.570 --> 28:05.720
They had a shut out!

28:06.342 --> 28:07.342
Coach!

28:08.862 --> 28:11.357
Way to go, bud.
I'm proud of you.

28:14.068 --> 28:15.344
Good game, baby.

28:17.071 --> 28:19.183
- Great game.
- Oh, thanks!

28:19.343 --> 28:20.777
- Great game.
- Thanks, Mo.

28:21.154 --> 28:23.488
Cheers. Come here, you.
Come here!

28:24.313 --> 28:26.074
There's the little one.
How you doing?

28:26.771 --> 28:28.492
Sweetheart, bye.
See you soon.

28:28.753 --> 28:30.120
I'll talk to you later.

28:30.380 --> 28:32.947
Blew the shut out though.
You did blow the shut out.

28:33.107 --> 28:35.625
Coach,
put the hammer down next time!

28:36.092 --> 28:37.988
- Bye.
- Come here, you.

28:38.148 --> 28:39.336
Come here, you.

28:47.474 --> 28:49.605
Running things pretty wide open.
West coast offense.

28:49.765 --> 28:52.392
That's what they call it now.
No offense to coach Walsh,

28:52.888 --> 28:54.103
God rest him,

28:54.539 --> 28:57.271
but we were running that down here
ten years before he was.

28:57.533 --> 28:58.689
Speed and quickness.

28:59.133 --> 29:01.535
- That's what we're looking for.
- Yes, sir.

29:01.695 --> 29:04.445
We don't have the size,
but we got the heart.

29:04.696 --> 29:08.033
And a guy like you,
see the field and make his cuts.

29:08.882 --> 29:10.732
That's exactly what we need.

29:14.978 --> 29:17.097
- What?
- I told your coach here,

29:17.257 --> 29:19.794
six years ago, that I thought
you were the complete package,

29:20.159 --> 29:21.784
mentally and physically.

29:21.944 --> 29:23.494
What?
Six years ago?

29:23.819 --> 29:26.217
Oh, yeah, I saw you run
in the seventh grade, son.

29:26.789 --> 29:27.926
And eighth grade.

29:28.241 --> 29:29.452
And your freshman year

29:29.612 --> 29:32.098
when you went from JV to Varsity
after that Arnett mead game.

29:32.883 --> 29:35.852
Then old Taylor here comes along
lookin'at that Dillon job.

29:36.632 --> 29:39.182
And I said to him,
that Brian Williams...

29:39.342 --> 29:41.941
Brian Williams's gonna be a star.
He'll make you one too.

29:42.633 --> 29:43.757
You were right.

29:43.917 --> 29:46.153
- Congratulations.
- Truth is, Williams,

29:46.508 --> 29:48.646
I didn't think we had a shot at you.

29:48.882 --> 29:51.951
And if you want to keep looking,
we won't take it personal.

29:52.446 --> 29:55.830
And I say we because
we're one big family here.

29:56.332 --> 29:57.749
Let us know something, okay?

29:58.076 --> 30:00.585
- I wanna thank you for coming down.
- Oh, thank you.

30:03.631 --> 30:04.981
Thank you, coach.

30:07.510 --> 30:08.510
Coach Deeks...

30:12.545 --> 30:15.683
I'd like to make my official commitment
to play for Whitmore University, sir.

30:16.134 --> 30:18.478
You want to play ball with us?
Fine.

30:19.130 --> 30:21.563
Come on over
and meet some of the fellas.

30:23.830 --> 30:25.595
Okay, men.
Bring it in!

30:28.207 --> 30:29.207
Okay, men.

30:29.541 --> 30:30.990
This is Brian Williams.

30:31.531 --> 30:33.361
He's gonna be joining us soon.

30:34.069 --> 30:36.419
He's gonna be part of our family now.

30:36.823 --> 30:38.248
We wanna make him feel welcome.

30:41.138 --> 30:45.130
He made us a reservation at <i>Carmelo's</i>.
You know, that new italian place.

30:45.895 --> 30:47.824
<i>He wants to take us
to a nice dinner.</i>

30:47.984 --> 30:50.051
It's the world's longest
business trip, isn't it?

30:50.435 --> 30:51.135
What?

30:51.506 --> 30:52.965
All right, fine.
You know what?

30:53.125 --> 30:54.758
Let's at least go get barbecue.

30:54.918 --> 30:57.516
- I don't wanna spend all night with Mo.
- <i>We don't have to go.</i>

30:57.778 --> 30:59.731
If you're gonna be crabby,
let's just not.

30:59.891 --> 31:01.395
We'll do it next time he's in town.

31:01.843 --> 31:04.941
No, no, it's fine. We'll go out,
we'll get it done, we'll do it.

31:05.810 --> 31:07.735
Hey, hey, how did it go with Smash?

31:09.319 --> 31:10.863
He's going to Whitmore.

31:11.125 --> 31:13.407
<i>Oh, that's great news.
Will you please tell him</i>

31:13.669 --> 31:15.743
congratulations from me.
Corrina must be thrilled.

31:16.184 --> 31:17.184
I will.

31:18.075 --> 31:20.456
Listen, I gotta go.
I'll talk to you later, all right?

31:20.718 --> 31:23.125
All right, I'll talk to you later, bye.

31:23.386 --> 31:26.029
He was Annabel Quimby's grandson.

31:26.546 --> 31:29.799
Yes, and I said, "I remember
when you were nothing but just a thought

31:30.059 --> 31:31.634
in somebody's back yard."

31:33.560 --> 31:36.514
Lyla, what college
are you thinking of applying to?

31:37.224 --> 31:39.559
I'll apply probably to Texas,

31:39.819 --> 31:41.769
probably Baylor
'cause that's where my mom went.

31:42.247 --> 31:44.897
But where I really want
to go is Princeton.

31:45.433 --> 31:47.692
- Helena went to Princeton.
- Really?

31:48.498 --> 31:50.284
Cost me a small fortune,

31:50.885 --> 31:52.197
but it was well worth it.

31:52.623 --> 31:54.531
Right, like that russian lit degree

31:54.792 --> 31:57.619
is doing her a lot of good while
she's shopping for shoes at <i>Neiman's</i>.

32:30.361 --> 32:32.299
No kidding, you two did it right.

32:33.179 --> 32:35.967
You really did. You got married,
you got married properly.

32:36.127 --> 32:37.450
You married a good woman.

32:37.710 --> 32:39.841
I just wanna raise a glass
to both of you.

32:40.001 --> 32:41.246
Cheers.

32:41.406 --> 32:43.257
I guess the better man did win.

32:43.782 --> 32:46.626
To the love that is in there.
If we could just figure out

32:46.886 --> 32:48.753
- a way of getting to it.
- Absolutely.

32:49.013 --> 32:52.662
God bless coaches like you
for making that kind of thing happen.

32:52.822 --> 32:54.804
Well that's just a very kind...

32:55.277 --> 32:56.594
kind speech there, Mo.

32:59.253 --> 33:00.742
So fun to get together...

33:01.275 --> 33:02.468
We're not done.

33:02.628 --> 33:05.763
We got Julie at home.
You haven't even met Julie.

33:05.923 --> 33:08.235
- How's everything?
- Bring us a bottle of good whisky.

33:08.395 --> 33:09.720
Just for the heck of it.

33:09.880 --> 33:13.319
- We're gonna have to go home.
- Naw, I'll have a shot. It'll be great.

33:13.579 --> 33:15.587
Honey, we got scotch at home.

33:16.188 --> 33:17.198
Sweetheart?

33:19.616 --> 33:21.494
And the check.
Thank you.

33:22.839 --> 33:25.774
- I'll take the check.
- You can bring the check to me, please.

33:26.876 --> 33:29.627
- Here you go.
- Coach, good work. Proud of you.

33:30.158 --> 33:31.309
To lucky.

33:32.807 --> 33:33.840
To lucky.

33:37.514 --> 33:39.137
Well, they totally love you.

33:40.082 --> 33:42.758
I think my grandmother is
ready to start planning a wedding.

33:42.918 --> 33:45.893
- She's funny.
- I guess. You want some of this?

33:46.053 --> 33:47.134
Yeah, thanks.

33:47.294 --> 33:48.479
She told Kelly once,

33:49.198 --> 33:51.649
"The bigger your hair,
the closer you are to God."

33:53.974 --> 33:55.724
I can see her saying that.

33:56.285 --> 33:57.298
You can.

33:57.841 --> 33:59.032
I'm glad I came.

34:00.260 --> 34:01.451
Yeah, me too.

34:03.885 --> 34:05.257
So, are we alone?

34:06.070 --> 34:07.174
Pretty much.

34:50.050 --> 34:52.251
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

34:52.922 --> 34:53.936
Just...

34:56.612 --> 34:58.288
Can you hold that thought?

35:01.062 --> 35:04.597
You know how I feel about you. I don't
wanna do anything to mess it up, so...

35:11.104 --> 35:14.874
Even though it goes against every fiber
of my being, I think I should go.

35:18.508 --> 35:20.530
Are you okay?
Promise?

35:36.252 --> 35:40.057
Edward Butowski,
Abilene high school, 1998.

35:40.217 --> 35:43.052
He ran the exact same
triple stack offense, counters,

35:43.312 --> 35:46.222
halfback options. Coach,
you stole that offense from Butowski.

35:46.482 --> 35:48.349
- I stole it.
- I never heard you thank him.

35:48.609 --> 35:50.435
And from the Green Bay Packers, too.

35:51.056 --> 35:53.813
- Cheers to stealing.
- Cheers to liars.

35:54.607 --> 35:57.650
- Cheers to liars
- There we go. We both agree to that.

35:58.015 --> 36:01.320
- Great. Let's head on home now...
- No, no.

36:01.925 --> 36:04.741
- Let's go on home.
- Let's talk about something else

36:05.001 --> 36:07.451
that you stole.
This little lady right here.

36:07.611 --> 36:09.488
That's ridiculous.
Come on now, y'all.

36:09.648 --> 36:13.499
You look me in the eye
and you tell me you were not calling her

36:13.759 --> 36:16.565
behind my back and telling her
I was sleeping with Bellita Elizabeth.

36:16.725 --> 36:17.875
Say it, can you?

36:18.035 --> 36:21.048
This is ridiculous, Mo.
I knew you were sleeping with her.

36:21.309 --> 36:23.634
That's it. That's the last one.
We're going right now.

36:23.894 --> 36:25.803
- You're stupid.
- To stealers and liars.

36:26.063 --> 36:29.140
- Come on, y'all. Seriously.
- Red light?

36:29.549 --> 36:30.549
Red light.

36:30.709 --> 36:32.018
Stop it!

36:37.509 --> 36:39.400
You stole her!
Admit it!

36:42.538 --> 36:44.388
I'll see you at home, honey.

36:47.986 --> 36:49.105
Get your coat.

36:49.703 --> 36:50.775
Where's dad?

36:50.935 --> 36:52.744
He's not coming.

36:53.740 --> 36:56.390
If he's not going to church,
I'm not going to church.

36:56.550 --> 36:59.054
Well you could go right on in there
and tell him if you like.

36:59.214 --> 37:00.588
Let's all go.
Come on.

37:00.848 --> 37:03.800
If I've to get up and get out of bed
and go to church, so do you.

37:04.541 --> 37:06.974
Hi, honey.
Just your three girls here,

37:07.245 --> 37:09.597
wanting to see if you wanna come
to church with us, hon.

37:10.170 --> 37:11.474
What happened to your face?

37:12.927 --> 37:15.645
- I was defending your mama's honor.
- With your face?

37:15.905 --> 37:18.106
No, he was being an idiot.

37:19.120 --> 37:21.873
- Get me some aspirin please?
- No, honey, we're going to church.

37:22.033 --> 37:25.144
Sorry, we gotta run. Love you.
Say bye to your daddy.

37:25.304 --> 37:26.641
- Bye, dad.
- Good-bye.

37:26.801 --> 37:29.149
- Yell "bye" louder.
- Bye, dad!

37:29.864 --> 37:32.203
Bye, honey!
We'll miss ya!

37:32.642 --> 37:34.437
Oh, I love you too.

37:38.898 --> 37:41.629
Great job, yesterday.
The coach and all the boys.

37:41.889 --> 37:44.882
- We're looking forward to playoffs.
- Oh, yeah. It's coming up.

37:45.142 --> 37:47.761
- Hello, Ms. Garrity.
- How you doing?

37:47.921 --> 37:48.939
Bless you.

37:49.099 --> 37:52.140
- So how's the ranch?
- The ranch was great.

37:52.612 --> 37:54.078
Oh, really?

37:54.238 --> 37:56.227
Yeah, really. His family's awesome.

37:56.676 --> 37:58.354
He was a perfect gentlemen.

38:00.157 --> 38:01.774
You're really gonna come
every Sunday?

38:02.034 --> 38:04.277
Yeah, of course.
Whatever it takes.

38:04.801 --> 38:06.404
Ms. McGowan.

38:07.279 --> 38:09.448
- How are you?
- Good morning, Timothy.

38:09.737 --> 38:11.890
Good morning.
How are you this morning?

38:12.050 --> 38:14.287
- I'm wonderful. And you?
- I'm great.

38:14.552 --> 38:16.350
- Would you care to join us?
- I can't.

38:16.510 --> 38:17.832
- Yeah, you can.
- No.

38:18.092 --> 38:20.293
Yes, you can.
Just sit beside us.

38:20.553 --> 38:22.226
I'll see you later, Tim.

38:22.612 --> 38:24.362
All right, suit yourself.

38:41.499 --> 38:42.499
Baby?

38:43.123 --> 38:45.067
Dinner'll be ready
in about half an hour.

38:45.675 --> 38:47.293
You finish your homework?

38:47.612 --> 38:49.851
Yeah. I'll be right down.

38:50.495 --> 38:51.741
Baby, you all right?

38:52.739 --> 38:53.889
I'm fine, ma.

38:55.736 --> 38:58.329
You know your auntie Shay
called this morning.

38:58.489 --> 39:01.039
She told me to tell you
congratulations.

39:03.515 --> 39:04.962
You know how proud we are of you?

39:05.550 --> 39:08.692
You're going to college, boy,
on a full scholarship.

39:10.966 --> 39:11.968
Listen...

39:13.050 --> 39:15.430
I know Whitmore isn't
what you dreamed of.

39:16.051 --> 39:18.684
But honey, when a door closes,

39:18.944 --> 39:20.311
God opens a window.

39:20.987 --> 39:23.078
He don't never fumble
the ball, baby.

39:23.238 --> 39:25.964
He always gets the touchdown.
That's God's plan.

39:27.613 --> 39:29.862
Now you're gonna get
a good education, Brian.

39:31.113 --> 39:32.907
You're gonna be
the star of their team.

39:33.540 --> 39:35.190
It's gonna be all right.

39:37.739 --> 39:40.195
I'm gonna go and finish
frying this chicken.

39:40.355 --> 39:42.308
And I got your favorite dessert.

39:44.487 --> 39:48.038
I knew that'd put a smile on your face.
You come on up out this room.

39:48.339 --> 39:49.340
Come on.

40:00.444 --> 40:03.271
There's probably a million reasons
why this is a bad idea,

40:03.531 --> 40:06.093
and I get that. I completely do
and I know you have to start

40:06.253 --> 40:09.139
with, like, number one being
how I acted the other day.

40:09.299 --> 40:11.362
That was totally inappropriate, Jason.

40:11.622 --> 40:12.897
I need that job.

40:13.322 --> 40:14.323
I'm sorry.

40:14.986 --> 40:18.968
It's just that nothing like this
has ever really happened to me before.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.122
So I might've overreacted
a little bit.

40:21.739 --> 40:22.739
A lot.

40:25.037 --> 40:26.924
All I'm asking you...

40:27.674 --> 40:29.921
is to not, like...

40:30.738 --> 40:32.300
make a brash decision here.

40:32.561 --> 40:34.481
Think about it
just for a little bit.

40:34.641 --> 40:37.179
Jason, I have thought about it
every which way.

40:38.285 --> 40:40.891
It's so weird.
I already feel my body changing.

40:41.362 --> 40:44.937
I've got cramps,
and I'm tired all the time.

40:45.842 --> 40:47.606
I mean, it sucks.

40:48.088 --> 40:50.175
I understand what you're saying.

40:50.719 --> 40:53.599
But it makes sense. Think about it.
There's a little...

40:53.759 --> 40:54.780
baby in there.

40:55.304 --> 40:57.895
A little person's in there:
little fingers,

40:58.055 --> 41:00.202
and little toes,
and a little heartbeat.

41:00.932 --> 41:03.768
He's got his eyes all scrunched up.
He's in a ball.

41:03.928 --> 41:06.781
Maybe he's got a wee-wee,
Maybe he doesn't.

41:07.305 --> 41:09.045
Aren't you the least bit curious?

41:09.739 --> 41:12.162
You got a human life in there.

41:13.489 --> 41:17.094
You're not one of those people
that blows up clinics, are you?

41:17.428 --> 41:19.488
I'm just saying it could be...

41:19.648 --> 41:21.893
That little person
could be the next Bill Gates

41:22.053 --> 41:23.726
or the next Peyton Manning...

41:23.986 --> 41:26.490
Or Britney Spears
with a learning disorder,

41:26.792 --> 41:28.393
if that's not redundant.

41:28.553 --> 41:30.733
No way.
Not on my watch.

41:32.180 --> 41:33.837
Oh, God.

41:35.017 --> 41:36.284
Look, Erin...

41:38.553 --> 41:39.716
I understand.

41:41.178 --> 41:42.414
This right here

41:42.574 --> 41:45.915
could be the most important decision
that we'll ever make.

41:46.427 --> 41:49.168
And if you choose
to give this a chance,

41:50.616 --> 41:52.275
I will be there with you.

41:53.145 --> 41:54.148
Every day.

41:55.115 --> 41:57.093
You won't be the only one
loving him.

41:57.756 --> 41:58.756
100%.

42:00.005 --> 42:01.722
Anything you ask,

42:01.982 --> 42:04.767
anything you need, day-in, day-out.
I'll be there.

42:05.691 --> 42:06.705
Really?

42:07.905 --> 42:10.212
Give it some time.
Give it a shot.

42:12.570 --> 42:13.584
Please.

42:16.312 --> 42:19.339
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty please.

42:21.344 --> 42:23.055
So give it a chance.
