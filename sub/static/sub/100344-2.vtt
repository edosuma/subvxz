calling him Whiffer,

calling him "Push It."

before you go upstairs,

can I just ask you to tell me
about...

Because...

52:35.791 --> 52:38.041
he said he'd got it
from a nurse...

52:39.166 --> 52:40.374
but the nurse was a man.

can be men.

in a hallway,

52:54.082 --> 52:56.625
he bumped into the nurse
on a wet floor,

52:58.666 --> 53:01.249
he grabbed the nurse's hand
as he fell down,

53:01.333 --> 53:03.082
and when he got back up he...

53:04.166 --> 53:06.082
saw he'd got a cut on his wrist.
