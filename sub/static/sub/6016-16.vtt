00:04.295 --> 00:07.992
I'm tired of pretending I'm excited
every time it's somebody's birthday.

00:08.166 --> 00:10.896
What is the big deal?
How many times do we have to...

00:11.069 --> 00:13.264
...celebrate that someone was born?

00:13.438 --> 00:17.067
Every year, over and over.
All you did was not die for 12 months.

00:17.241 --> 00:19.971
That's all you've done,
as far as I could tell.

00:20.144 --> 00:22.578
I love the astrology things
that tell you the people...

00:22.747 --> 00:24.442
...that have the same birthday
as you.

00:24.616 --> 00:26.413
It's always an odd group
of people to it.

00:26.584 --> 00:29.382
It's like Ed Asner,
Elijah Muhammed and Secretariat.

00:35.159 --> 00:37.093
I don't wanna live.

00:37.261 --> 00:39.821
I don't wanna live!

00:40.698 --> 00:42.723
Because of me?

00:42.900 --> 00:46.028
You must be joking. Who wouldn't
wanna live because of me?

00:46.204 --> 00:48.536
- I'm nothing.
- No.

00:48.706 --> 00:51.800
- You're something.
- You can do better than me.

00:51.976 --> 00:55.036
You could throw a dart out the window
and hit someone better than me.

00:55.213 --> 00:56.578
I'm no good.

00:56.748 --> 00:58.978
You're good. You're good.

00:59.150 --> 01:00.674
I'm bad. I'm bad.

01:00.852 --> 01:02.649
You're killing me!

01:02.820 --> 01:05.618
So what could I do?
I couldn't go through with it.

01:05.790 --> 01:07.348
She threatened to kill herself.

01:07.692 --> 01:09.319
Over you?

01:10.795 --> 01:13.025
Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?

01:14.465 --> 01:16.262
- Well...
- I'm trying to get in touch...

01:16.434 --> 01:18.800
...with Sharon Leonard.
She works for the NYU paper.

01:18.970 --> 01:22.201
This is Jerry Seinfeld. She was
supposed to meet me for an interview.

01:22.373 --> 01:24.864
Oh, what are you gonna get
Jerry for his birthday?

01:25.043 --> 01:27.102
- I got him a great gift.
- Really? What?

01:27.278 --> 01:29.143
I got two tickets
to see Guys and Dolls.

01:29.313 --> 01:31.907
Oh, that is a good gift.

01:32.083 --> 01:33.414
Maybe he'll take me.

01:34.318 --> 01:37.082
No, I'm gonna go with him.

01:37.255 --> 01:38.552
What did you get him?

01:39.057 --> 01:40.854
I got him a two-line phone.

01:41.025 --> 01:42.253
Really? That's good.

01:42.427 --> 01:44.520
Unbelievable. She's not there.

01:44.696 --> 01:47.893
- What paper does she write for?
- For the NYU school newspaper.

01:48.066 --> 01:51.126
She's a grad student in journalism.
Never been to a comedy club.

01:51.302 --> 01:52.963
Never seen me.
Has no idea who I am.

01:53.137 --> 01:55.128
Never even seen you?

01:55.306 --> 01:56.967
Gotta kind of envy that.

01:58.643 --> 02:01.806
You know, you've been developing
quite the acid tongue lately.

02:02.747 --> 02:04.374
Really?

02:04.549 --> 02:08.383
Who do you think is
the most unattractive world leader?

02:08.686 --> 02:10.620
- Living or all-time?
- All-time.

02:10.788 --> 02:13.951
If it's all-time, there's no contest.
It begins and ends with Brezhnev.

02:14.425 --> 02:16.950
I don't know. Did you ever
get a good look at De Gaulle?

02:17.428 --> 02:20.261
Lyndon Johnson
was uglier than De Gaulle.

02:20.631 --> 02:23.828
I got news for you. Golda Meir
could make them all run up a tree.

02:25.737 --> 02:27.602
Golda Meir. Good one, babe.

02:29.107 --> 02:31.632
Hey, come here. Come here.

02:31.809 --> 02:34.869
Those two girls behind you,
they're eavesdropping.

02:35.813 --> 02:39.214
- Really?
- You know just because you two...

02:39.383 --> 02:40.975
...are homosexuals, so what?

02:43.187 --> 02:48.147
I mean, you should come out of
the closet and be openly gay already.

02:50.394 --> 02:52.259
So, what do you say?

02:54.165 --> 02:57.430
You know you'll always
be the only man I'll ever love.

02:57.702 --> 02:59.260
What's the matter with you?

02:59.437 --> 03:02.838
- Come on. Go along.
- I'm not going along.

03:03.007 --> 03:06.101
I could just see you in Berlin
in 1939 goose-stepping past me.

03:06.277 --> 03:09.269
"Come on, Jerry.
Go along. Go along."

03:09.547 --> 03:12.072
- You're no fun.
- You know, I hear that all the time.

03:12.250 --> 03:14.480
- Hear what?
- That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.

03:14.652 --> 03:16.347
Yeah, people ask me that
about you too.

03:16.521 --> 03:20.184
Yeah, because I'm single,
I'm thin, and I'm neat.

03:21.893 --> 03:23.554
And you get along well with women.

03:23.728 --> 03:26.288
I guess that leaves me in the clear.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.132
Hi, Jerry, it's Sharon Leonard
from the NYU paper.

03:31.302 --> 03:33.827
I'm here at the coffee shop,
and I was a little late.

03:34.005 --> 03:35.472
We must have missed
each other.

03:35.640 --> 03:37.403
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Me too.

03:37.575 --> 03:41.636
I'll be here for a little while longer,
and I'll try to hook up with you later.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:50.354 --> 03:51.946
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:52.123 --> 03:56.651
I just thought of a great name for
myself, if I ever become a porno actor.

03:58.095 --> 04:01.223
Oh, yeah? What? Buck Naked?

04:02.967 --> 04:04.935
Yeah. How did you know that?

04:05.536 --> 04:08.061
You told me that already.
Like two months ago.

04:08.606 --> 04:10.574
Let me ask you something.

04:11.142 --> 04:13.042
What do you think of this shirt?

04:13.911 --> 04:16.004
Well...

04:16.680 --> 04:19.115
Allison bought it for me.

04:22.086 --> 04:24.816
- How you gonna get out of that one?
- I don't know.

04:24.989 --> 04:27.787
I guess I have to wait for her to die.

04:31.162 --> 04:32.823
- Yeah?
- Sharon from N YU.

04:32.997 --> 04:34.225
Come on up.

04:34.398 --> 04:37.231
- Who's that?
- Oh, that's that reporter from NYU.

04:37.401 --> 04:39.733
She's doing the interview.
I told her to come here...

04:39.904 --> 04:41.269
...so we won't miss each other.

04:41.439 --> 04:44.067
- Do you want me to stay or...?
- Sure, I don't care.

04:46.777 --> 04:48.039
Hi.

04:48.679 --> 04:50.306
Hi, I'm... I'm Sharon.

04:50.481 --> 04:52.381
Hi, I'm Jerry.

04:52.950 --> 04:56.044
- Something the matter?
- No, no. Nothing.

04:56.220 --> 04:59.656
- You look familiar. Have we ever met?
- I'm not sure. Have we?

05:00.224 --> 05:01.919
You look familiar.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.493
Why don't we do this over here?
This is George.

05:04.662 --> 05:06.892
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

05:07.064 --> 05:10.227
- He'll hang around, if that's okay.
- Sure, I'd like to talk to him too.

05:10.401 --> 05:12.562
Oh, really?

05:13.638 --> 05:15.299
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:15.573 --> 05:16.835
There we go.

05:18.009 --> 05:22.070
- Oh, is that a problem?
- No, I just hate my voice on tape.

05:22.246 --> 05:24.976
It always sounds so high and whiny.

05:25.917 --> 05:27.509
- Well, shall we start?
- Fire away.

05:27.685 --> 05:32.782
Okay, let's see. Are you just a
comedian, or do you do anything else?

05:32.957 --> 05:35.858
Well, right now George
and I are writing a pilot for NBC.

05:36.027 --> 05:37.654
Oh, so you also work together.

05:38.763 --> 05:40.162
Yeah.

05:41.499 --> 05:43.524
Jerry, did you wash this pear?

05:44.268 --> 05:48.227
- Yeah, I washed it.
- It looks like it hasn't been washed.

05:48.472 --> 05:50.736
So wash it.

05:51.909 --> 05:54.434
You hear the way he talks to me?

05:58.649 --> 06:01.345
You should hear
how my boyfriend talks to me.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.048
What?

06:04.755 --> 06:07.383
Hey, let me ask you something.

06:07.558 --> 06:09.025
What do you think of this shirt?

06:09.527 --> 06:10.789
It's nice.

06:11.562 --> 06:14.190
Jerry said he didn't like it.

06:14.365 --> 06:16.560
I didn't say I didn't like it.
I said it was okay.

06:16.734 --> 06:19.965
- Oh, you said you didn't like it.
- Oh, well, so what if I don't like it?

06:20.137 --> 06:22.571
Is that, like, the end
of the world or something?

06:22.740 --> 06:24.537
So how did you two meet?

06:24.709 --> 06:26.802
Oh, actually, we met
in a gym locker room.

06:26.978 --> 06:28.570
Yeah.

06:28.746 --> 06:31.772
Actually, it was in gym class.
I was trying to climb the ropes...

06:31.949 --> 06:34.042
...and Jerry was spotting me.

06:34.285 --> 06:38.312
And I kept slipping
and burning my thighs.

06:38.589 --> 06:41.490
And then finally I slipped,
and I fell on Jerry's head.

06:43.728 --> 06:46.162
We've been close ever since.

06:46.397 --> 06:47.659
Do you guys live together?

06:48.532 --> 06:50.557
- Live together?
- No, I got my own place.

06:50.735 --> 06:53.067
Oh, and do your parents know?

06:53.804 --> 06:55.897
- Know what?
- My parents?

06:56.073 --> 06:58.098
They don't know what's going on.

07:00.011 --> 07:02.912
You're that girl in the coffee shop
that was eavesdropping on us.

07:03.080 --> 07:04.377
I knew you looked familiar.

07:04.548 --> 07:05.879
Oh, no! No!

07:06.650 --> 07:09.346
- I better get going.
- There's been a big misunderstanding.

07:09.520 --> 07:12.353
We did that for your benefit.
We knew you were eavesdropping.

07:12.523 --> 07:15.617
That's why my friend said all that.
It was on purpose. We're not gay.

07:15.793 --> 07:17.624
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

07:17.795 --> 07:20.229
- No, of course not.
- It's fine, if that's who you are.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.389
- Absolutely.
- I mean, I have many gay friends.

07:22.566 --> 07:24.898
- My father's gay.
- Look...

07:25.069 --> 07:26.297
...I know what I heard.

07:26.470 --> 07:29.098
- Heard. It was a joke.
- Look, you wanna have sex right now?

07:29.273 --> 07:32.037
Do you wanna have sex
with me right now? Let's go.

07:33.944 --> 07:36.879
Come on! Let's go, baby! Come on!

07:38.549 --> 07:42.383
Hey, come on. Let's go.
I thought we were gonna take a steam.

07:43.387 --> 07:46.288
- No, I don't want any steam.
- No. No steam.

07:46.457 --> 07:49.187
Well, I don't wanna
sit there naked all by myself.

07:49.427 --> 07:50.985
The whole thing's your fault.

07:51.262 --> 07:53.924
You want me to talk to her?
I'd be perfectly willing to.

07:54.131 --> 07:55.962
- I don't think so.
- Because you know me...

07:56.133 --> 07:59.227
...I walk into a room,
problem solved.

08:00.504 --> 08:02.062
She says she'll think about it.

08:02.473 --> 08:06.933
So what, even if it does come out.
It'll just be in an NYU paper.

08:07.478 --> 08:09.139
Why don't you take your jacket off?

08:09.313 --> 08:12.305
- No, I'm okay.
- I'm gonna try her again.

08:12.483 --> 08:14.314
Boy.

08:14.552 --> 08:17.282
Happy birthday. "Faruba!"

08:17.488 --> 08:21.584
- Today's not my birthday.
- Well, I beg to differ.

08:22.093 --> 08:24.152
Well, I think I know
when my birthday is.

08:24.328 --> 08:26.853
Yeah, well, you'd think so,
but you'd be wrong.

08:29.366 --> 08:31.857
Maybe he's right.
Maybe it is my birthday.

08:32.903 --> 08:34.530
Would you take the jacket off?

08:34.705 --> 08:37.606
Leave me alone. Get off
my back about the jacket.

08:37.775 --> 08:39.868
- Oh, look at this. A phone.
- Yeah.

08:40.044 --> 08:42.068
A two-line phone.

08:43.246 --> 08:45.112
That's terrific! Thanks a lot.

08:45.282 --> 08:47.614
Now when someone's
on the phone, I can make a call.

08:47.785 --> 08:49.946
- Yeah.
- Look, Elaine, a two-line phone.

08:50.321 --> 08:51.948
Yeah, I see it.

08:52.123 --> 08:53.613
I'm gonna get one myself.

08:53.824 --> 08:55.291
Where you going?

08:55.459 --> 08:57.450
I gotta go return something.

08:58.863 --> 09:00.728
I got a dial tone.

09:00.898 --> 09:02.957
- Okay, this is the maiden call.
- Yeah.

09:03.134 --> 09:04.965
Wait, wait. I wanna get the first call.

09:05.136 --> 09:07.104
All right. Go to your house.
I'll call you.

09:12.977 --> 09:14.808
- Hello.
- Hello.

09:14.979 --> 09:17.709
Hey, it's working. This is great.
Thanks a lot.

09:17.882 --> 09:20.715
- Happy birthday, buddy.
- Wait, I got a call on the other line.

09:20.885 --> 09:23.752
- Okay, later.
- All right, I'll talk to you later.

09:23.921 --> 09:26.355
- Hello?
- Jerry, it's Sharon from N YU.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.389
- Oh, hi.
- I was just calling to tell you...

09:28.559 --> 09:31.460
...I'm not gonna play up that angle
we talked about on the story.

09:31.629 --> 09:34.097
Oh, thank you very much.
That's great.

09:34.265 --> 09:37.257
Hold on a second.
I got a call on the other line.

09:37.668 --> 09:38.896
- Hello.
- Hey.

09:39.069 --> 09:41.970
How you doing? You know I got
that reporter from the newspaper...

09:42.139 --> 09:44.835
...on the other line.
- So, what did she say?

09:45.009 --> 09:47.603
She said she's not gonna play up
that angle in the story.

09:47.778 --> 09:50.338
She thinks we're heterosexual.
I guess we fooled her.

09:50.514 --> 09:52.709
All right, I'll get rid of her. Hold on.

09:52.950 --> 09:54.440
Sharon?

09:54.952 --> 09:56.579
Hello?

09:57.154 --> 09:59.088
Sharon, are you there?

10:00.224 --> 10:02.715
- I'm back.
- You know...

10:02.993 --> 10:05.518
...I could hear you on the other line.

10:13.604 --> 10:15.231
What are you talking about?

10:15.406 --> 10:18.807
I heard what you said:
"Sharon, are you there?"

10:18.976 --> 10:21.536
You heard me talking
on the other line? Are you sure?

10:21.712 --> 10:23.043
Yes, I heard you.

10:23.214 --> 10:24.442
Maybe she was disconnected.

10:24.615 --> 10:27.641
Maybe she wasn't. Maybe she heard
the whole conversation.

10:27.818 --> 10:32.346
All right. Let me call Kramer, and see
if you can hear anything. Hold on.

10:35.893 --> 10:36.951
- Hello.
- There may be...

10:37.127 --> 10:38.719
...a problem with the phone.
Hold on.

10:38.896 --> 10:40.625
"There may be a problem
with the phone."

10:40.798 --> 10:42.390
Oh, no!

10:43.400 --> 10:46.062
Kramer, this phone's
a piece of junk. Goodbye.

10:46.237 --> 10:47.602
"This phone's a piece of junk."

10:47.771 --> 10:49.898
Oh, no! She's heard everything!
What will we do?

10:50.074 --> 10:52.941
She thinks we're gay. Not that
there's anything wrong with it.

10:53.110 --> 10:55.943
No, no, of course not. People's
personal sexual preferences...

10:56.113 --> 10:57.944
...are nobody's business
but their own.

11:01.285 --> 11:02.616
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:02.786 --> 11:04.219
Elaine, right? Nice to meet you.

11:04.388 --> 11:07.619
- Thanks for meeting with me.
- Sure. Would you like to take a seat?

11:07.791 --> 11:09.452
- Sure.
- Thank you.

11:09.627 --> 11:12.095
Why don't you take your coat off?

11:14.598 --> 11:17.158
So she kept insisting
I take off my coat.

11:17.434 --> 11:21.803
I refused, and then she forcibly
tried to get me to remove it.

11:21.972 --> 11:24.167
She didn't take her coat off
in my house, either.

11:25.276 --> 11:28.507
You know there are tribes in Indonesia
where if you keep your coat on...

11:28.679 --> 11:30.772
...in somebody's house,
the families go to war.

11:31.048 --> 11:32.709
Give me a break.

11:32.916 --> 11:35.510
So you don't take your coat off,
and now everyone at NYU...

11:35.686 --> 11:38.655
...thinks I'm gay. Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

11:38.822 --> 11:40.517
Not at all.

11:42.126 --> 11:44.321
- Take that coat off.
- I don't want to take it off.

11:44.495 --> 11:47.089
Take your coat off, already.

11:49.633 --> 11:51.794
When will we see it?
I'd like to read the article.

11:51.969 --> 11:53.493
They're sending it to me.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.468
All right, well...

11:55.639 --> 11:58.699
- Here you go. Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

11:59.310 --> 12:02.404
Two tickets to Guys and Dolls.
I'm gonna go with you.

12:05.249 --> 12:09.117
Guys and Dolls?
Isn't that a lavish Broadway musical?

12:10.154 --> 12:13.715
It's Guys and Dolls,
not Guys and Guys.

12:14.658 --> 12:17.092
You're right. Guys and Dolls.
Thanks. Thanks very much.

12:17.261 --> 12:20.492
- All right.
- All right, well...

12:20.798 --> 12:24.427
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, Lainey!

12:26.737 --> 12:30.229
The Collected Works
of Bette Midler.

12:34.178 --> 12:37.341
What? l...
I thought you liked Bette Midler.

12:37.514 --> 12:39.175
She's all right.

12:39.350 --> 12:42.046
- You said you liked her.
- Well, so what? Maybe I do like her.

12:42.219 --> 12:44.813
- So what?
- So nothing.

12:47.191 --> 12:50.285
- Well, thanks for the CDs.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

12:52.229 --> 12:56.063
Why are those two people
pointing at you over there?

12:56.600 --> 12:58.158
I don't know.

13:03.173 --> 13:05.038
- What've you got there?
- The New York Post.

13:05.209 --> 13:07.439
They've got an article about you.

13:08.479 --> 13:10.879
"Although they maintain
separate residences...

13:11.048 --> 13:16.247
...the comedian and his longtime
companion seem to be inseparable."

13:16.420 --> 13:18.945
Oh, no, The Associated Press
picked up the NYU story.

13:19.123 --> 13:20.556
That's gonna be in every paper.

13:20.724 --> 13:23.352
I've been outed. I wasn't even in.

13:25.095 --> 13:26.892
Now everyone's gonna
think we're gay.

13:27.064 --> 13:29.726
Not that there's anything wrong
with that.

13:29.900 --> 13:31.128
No, not at all.

13:36.774 --> 13:40.835
"Within the confines
of his fastidious bachelor pad...

13:41.011 --> 13:45.141
...Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over
the cleanliness of a piece of fruit...

13:45.315 --> 13:48.944
...like an old married couple."
I told you that pear was washed.

13:53.957 --> 13:56.391
I thought we were friends.

14:01.198 --> 14:02.756
Here we go.

14:02.933 --> 14:05.424
I mean, how could you two keep this
a secret from me?

14:05.602 --> 14:08.662
- It's not true.
- Enough lying.

14:08.839 --> 14:10.500
The lying is through.

14:10.674 --> 14:13.108
Come on, Jerry,
the masquerade is over.

14:13.277 --> 14:16.337
You're thin, late 30s, single.

14:16.780 --> 14:19.305
- So are you.
- Yeah.

14:30.194 --> 14:32.355
- Hello.
- George?

14:32.863 --> 14:34.490
Mrs. Seinfeld?

14:34.665 --> 14:37.463
Oh, my God.

14:38.602 --> 14:41.332
Oh, my God. Ma?

14:41.505 --> 14:43.166
- Jerry?
- Ma.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.205
Oh, my God!

14:45.442 --> 14:47.672
My mother!

14:49.279 --> 14:51.713
- Jerry.
- Ma, it's not true.

14:51.949 --> 14:54.417
It was those culottes
you made him wear when he was 5.

14:54.585 --> 14:56.746
They weren't culottes.
They were shorts.

14:56.920 --> 15:00.287
They were culottes! You bought
them in the girls' department.

15:00.457 --> 15:04.223
By mistake.
By mistake, Jerry. I'm sorry.

15:04.394 --> 15:07.454
It looked like he was wearing a skirt,
for crying out loud.

15:07.631 --> 15:09.326
It has nothing to do
with the culottes.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.094
Not that there's anything wrong
with that, Jerry.

15:14.338 --> 15:18.570
I open up the paper, and this
is what I have to read about?

15:18.742 --> 15:20.539
I fell right off the toilet.

15:22.079 --> 15:24.639
My back went out again.
I couldn't move.

15:24.815 --> 15:26.942
The super had to come
and help me up.

15:27.117 --> 15:28.709
I was half-naked.

15:30.254 --> 15:31.687
It's not true.

15:31.989 --> 15:34.423
Every day it's something else
with you.

15:34.591 --> 15:36.616
I don't know anything
about you anymore.

15:36.793 --> 15:39.728
Who are you?
What kind of life are you leading?

15:40.030 --> 15:44.558
Who knows what you're doing.
Maybe you're making porno films.

15:44.835 --> 15:46.166
Yeah.

15:46.336 --> 15:47.598
I'm Buck Naked.

15:47.771 --> 15:50.968
You're who? Buck Naked?

15:51.141 --> 15:55.134
Jerry, I can see.
He's so neat and thin.

15:55.312 --> 15:57.041
Not that there's anything
wrong with it.

15:57.214 --> 15:58.943
Of course not.

16:01.852 --> 16:05.253
Six-thirty, Scott.
Time for your sponge bath.

16:08.926 --> 16:12.293
Six-thirty already? I fell asleep.

16:12.462 --> 16:16.990
Let me help you off with that.
Here, I'll Just slip it over your head.

16:21.772 --> 16:27.369
- The water's nice and warm, isn't it?
- Oh, that feels really good.

16:29.146 --> 16:32.081
George, are you
telling me the truth?

16:32.983 --> 16:35.474
George, I'm talking to you!

16:39.790 --> 16:41.621
Guess who left a message
on my machine.

16:41.792 --> 16:45.250
That reporter from NYU.
I wonder what she wants.

16:49.232 --> 16:51.393
All right.
Now the play is tomorrow night.

16:51.568 --> 16:54.093
Would you like dinner first
or just meet at the theater?

16:54.271 --> 16:56.637
Excuse me, sir,
I'm sorry to bother you.

16:56.807 --> 17:00.072
I want you to know that it took a lot
of guts to come out how you did...

17:00.243 --> 17:02.370
...and that you've inspired me
to do the same...

17:02.546 --> 17:05.606
...even though that may mean
a discharge from the service. Thanks.

17:14.891 --> 17:18.088
You know, I think I'll pass
on the Guys and Dolls.

17:18.595 --> 17:19.823
All right, fine, don't go.

17:20.097 --> 17:22.861
I try and go out and do something
special for your birthday...

17:23.032 --> 17:25.900
...and this is the thanks I get.
Everything's tainted now.

17:26.069 --> 17:30.665
- Would you keep your voice down?
- No, I will not keep my voice down!

17:30.874 --> 17:33.035
Nothing can make me keep
my voice down!

17:33.210 --> 17:37.579
If you boys cannot
control yourselves...

17:37.748 --> 17:40.683
...then I'm afraid I'm going to
have to ask you to leave.

17:49.660 --> 17:52.254
- Fine, I'll take Elaine.
- Yes.

17:52.429 --> 17:55.159
Just don't say anything to Allison.

17:55.332 --> 17:57.630
No, I won't.
Did she see the article?

17:57.801 --> 18:01.862
- No. Just imagine her reaction.
- Yeah.

18:02.239 --> 18:04.400
- Oh, my God.
- What?

18:04.708 --> 18:06.972
She hasn't seen the article.

18:07.377 --> 18:10.869
When she sees it,
she's gonna think...

18:11.314 --> 18:15.080
I'm out, baby! I'm out!

18:19.656 --> 18:22.216
Yeah, so?

18:22.392 --> 18:23.757
"Yeah, so?"

18:23.927 --> 18:26.452
Well, this is nice.
They mention your name.

18:26.630 --> 18:28.097
Don't you see what it says here?

18:28.265 --> 18:30.256
Don't you understand
what that's implying?

18:30.434 --> 18:32.265
No. What?

18:32.736 --> 18:35.899
I'm gay. I'm a gay man.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.064
I'm very, very gay.

18:38.375 --> 18:41.310
- You're gay?
- Extraordinarily gay.

18:41.478 --> 18:43.275
Steeped in gayness.

18:44.981 --> 18:46.414
I don't believe it.

18:47.284 --> 18:48.751
You don't believe me, ask Jerry.

18:49.286 --> 18:51.015
- I will.
- What do you mean, you will?

18:51.188 --> 18:52.678
No, no, no. That's a bad idea.

18:52.856 --> 18:57.384
- Jerry's a very private person.
- I wanna hear it from Jerry.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.967
Oh, can you ever forgive me?

19:08.839 --> 19:10.397
I don't know.

19:16.913 --> 19:19.279
All right, I forgive you.

19:20.317 --> 19:23.343
You know, the funny thing is,
I was attracted to you immediately.

19:23.520 --> 19:26.011
I was attracted to you too.
You remind me of Lois Lane.

19:38.435 --> 19:41.302
Jerry! Oh, my God!
What are you doing?

19:43.273 --> 19:44.501
What?

19:45.075 --> 19:46.633
You're with a woman!

19:46.910 --> 19:49.140
I know. What are you doing here?

19:49.312 --> 19:53.578
I leave you alone for two seconds,
and this is what you do?

19:53.750 --> 19:55.775
I trusted you!

19:56.753 --> 19:58.983
- Would you get the hell out of here?
- Stop it.

19:59.156 --> 20:01.454
- What...? What's going on?
- Yeah, what's going on?

20:01.625 --> 20:02.956
All right. Tell her. Go ahead.

20:03.126 --> 20:04.855
- Tell her what?
- You know, about us.

20:05.028 --> 20:06.928
- Are you crazy?
- Tell her, Jerry. Tell her.

20:07.097 --> 20:09.565
I'm telling her nothing.
Do you know what you're saying?

20:09.733 --> 20:11.325
This... This is too weird.

20:11.501 --> 20:14.197
Wait a minute. You wrote the article.
Go ahead. Tell her.

20:14.371 --> 20:15.599
I'm out of here.

20:15.772 --> 20:19.208
It's not true! It's not true!

20:19.376 --> 20:22.368
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

20:23.647 --> 20:26.673
- You stupid idiot.
- Oh, please don't be upset.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.875
Oh, would you stop it
with that stuff?

20:29.653 --> 20:32.144
What's going on?

20:32.322 --> 20:34.051
All right, I'll tell you the truth.

20:34.524 --> 20:36.788
I'm not gay.

20:37.160 --> 20:40.186
My name's Buck Naked.
I'm a porno actor.

20:47.070 --> 20:49.470
- Really?
- Oh, my God.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.972
- Hey, how you doing?
- How you doing?

20:54.244 --> 20:56.007
Hello.

20:56.580 --> 20:58.548
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi. How are you?

20:58.815 --> 21:01.409
All right, we'll see you later.

21:05.922 --> 21:08.516
He's the phone man.

21:11.428 --> 21:15.159
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

21:23.473 --> 21:25.134
I am not gay.

21:26.476 --> 21:29.639
I am, however,
thin, single and neat.

21:29.813 --> 21:31.542
When someone is thin,
single and neat...

21:31.715 --> 21:34.309
...people assume they're gay
because that's the stereotype.

21:34.484 --> 21:37.783
We normally don't think of gay people
as fat, sloppy and married.

21:38.154 --> 21:41.487
Although I'm sure there are, I don't
want to perpetuate the stereotype.

21:41.658 --> 21:44.627
I'm sure they're the minority,
though, within the gay community.

21:44.794 --> 21:47.820
Probably discriminated against.
Because of that, people say to them:

21:47.998 --> 21:50.091
"You know, Joe,
I enjoy being gay with you...

21:50.267 --> 21:54.363
...but it's about time you got in shape,
tucked your shirt in and lost the wife."

21:55.672 --> 21:58.197
If people are gonna assume
that neat people are gay...

21:58.375 --> 22:00.036
...instead of doing this:

22:00.210 --> 22:01.871
"I think Joe might be a little..."

22:02.045 --> 22:05.173
They should vacuum.
"You know, I think Joe might be..."

22:06.216 --> 22:07.547
Yeah.

22:07.984 --> 22:11.044
I got a feeling he's a little...
