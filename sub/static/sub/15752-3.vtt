Sorry, I'm just
a little nervous.

09:16.489 --> 09:17.725
I love that about you.

09:17.825 --> 09:19.226
What, my nervousness?

a little amused.

And for certain people,
I lavish my attention.

We should go to your studio

I want to be here with you,
all right?

10:38.739 --> 10:40.107
And when we get home,

10:40.207 --> 10:43.110
the only thing

Mm.

Pardon me.

at the bar?

Yes, it is.

as much experience

15:04.604 --> 15:06.339
and I don't have a roster
full of heavyweights,

my strength.

15:07.975 --> 15:10.610
I have the time.
I have the energy.

15:10.710 --> 15:13.246
I am wild about your book.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.482
So what do you think
the book is about?

15:15.582 --> 15:17.484
I've thought about that
a lot.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.785
Mm-hmm.

15:18.885 --> 15:20.988
I think the book
is about indignity.

I was writing a book

It's okay.

17:01.921 --> 17:03.156
I'm gonna go
make you some coffee.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.457
I'm not drunk.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.259
No, I'm not drunk.
I'm not.

Of course you can.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.138
Listen to me.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.705

a pep talk.

in the past 20 years.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.678

17:58.778 --> 18:00.280
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to Frida.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.681
- That was Frida.
- That was Frida?

18:01.781 --> 18:03.250
Come on. She needs,

18:14.461 --> 18:15.495
Uh...

- Okay.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.170

in the truck.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.338
I can give you $2,500
for all of it.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.673

18:26.773 --> 18:27.907
Uh, maybe
you didn't see it all.

No, show him.

Everything
is in great condition.

18:33.045 --> 18:34.247
We only had one girl,

18:34.347 --> 18:36.015
so we were actually able
to have nice things,

18:36.183 --> 18:37.450
unlike the boy families.

18:37.550 --> 18:38.551
See this chair?
It's a Stickley.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.420
And the dinette,
this was my mom's,

18:40.520 --> 18:41.521
and it's genuine cherry.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.223
Look, lady, I get it.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.524
I saw it.

18:44.624 --> 18:45.758
It's worth a couple grand.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.294
I know the market here.

18:47.394 --> 18:49.629
But it took me forever
to collect these things.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.198
I mean, I know
some of it's sentimental,

18:51.298 --> 18:52.732
but it's got to be worth
more than that,

18:52.832 --> 18:53.933
even as firewood.

18:54.033 --> 18:56.203
Okay, 3 grand.
Final offer.

18:56.303 --> 18:57.804
You're not gonna do better.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.372
Wow.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.274
You know what?
Let's go.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.042
- Where?
- Brooklyn.

19:03.210 --> 19:04.644
- Brooklyn?
- Yeah, Brooklyn.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.446
Everybody's moving to Brooklyn.

19:06.546 --> 19:09.449
[upbeat rock music]

19:09.549 --> 19:11.884
*

19:11.984 --> 19:13.052
It's so normcore.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.255
So normcore,
totally suburban.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.423
It's perfect.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.291
Enjoy it!

19:18.391 --> 19:19.426
We're cleaning up.

19:19.526 --> 19:20.860
See, this stuff's
not worthless.

19:20.960 --> 19:21.928
Brooklyn loves you.

19:22.028 --> 19:23.129
[phone chimes]

19:24.497 --> 19:25.732
Oh, my God,
look at this.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.602
Ooh, this guy's
really into you.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.070
I know.

19:31.238 --> 19:32.872
That's why I got
to tell him the truth.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.040
It's only a number.

19:34.140 --> 19:35.074
But it's a big one.

19:35.242 --> 19:36.876
You'll be fine.
Go.

19:36.976 --> 19:38.278
Frida deserves this.

19:42.282 --> 19:44.016
See ya.

19:44.116 --> 19:46.386
(Scissor Sisters)
* I don't mind
if you're running around *

19:46.486 --> 19:48.555
Josh, I know that you think
that we're the same age,

19:48.655 --> 19:51.391
but, actually,
I'm four...teen.

19:51.491 --> 19:54.060
That's right; I'm a minor,
and you're under arrest.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.963
* I'm laying in bed
with a whole lot of wonder *

19:57.063 --> 19:59.031
Did you know
Cameron Diaz is 40?

19:59.131 --> 20:00.500
She's not gross, right?

20:00.600 --> 20:01.801
* Midnight strikes

20:01.901 --> 20:04.337
* I don't know
where you've been *

20:04.437 --> 20:06.973
* But I still want
to make love tonight *

20:07.073 --> 20:08.875
* When you come stumbling in

20:08.975 --> 20:11.911
* Baby, come home to me

20:12.011 --> 20:15.748
* Baby,
come home to me *

20:15.848 --> 20:17.917
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:18.017 --> 20:20.119
I am so sorry
I passed out last night.

20:20.219 --> 20:23.323
I was just really nervous,
'cause--

20:23.423 --> 20:25.792
There's something
that I need to tell you.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.694
* Baby, come home to me

20:27.794 --> 20:30.363
* Baby,
come home to me *

20:30.463 --> 20:33.466
* It's a half past
quarter to three *

20:33.566 --> 20:35.335
Never mind.

20:35.435 --> 20:38.170
* Baby, come home

20:39.305 --> 20:45.669
