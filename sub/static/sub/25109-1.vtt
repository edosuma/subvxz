- Hey!
- Sorry.

02:30.499 --> 02:31.966
I didn't realize
you were masturbating.

02:32.035 --> 02:32.933
Yeah, very funny.

02:33.234 --> 02:34.267
Your sister's downstairs
making some

02:34.438 --> 02:36.405
la-di-da pancake thing
she saw on <i>Top Chef,</i>

02:36.472 --> 02:38.171
so we should
probably go eat that.

02:38.240 --> 02:39.606
Great. I'll be down
in just a second.

02:39.806 --> 02:42.940
Okay. Right after you finish
searching the internet for...

02:43.311 --> 02:45.412
lingerie photos of Gigi Habib?

02:45.613 --> 02:48.080
It's Hadid.

02:48.449 --> 02:50.583
Right. I didn't realize
she was your girlfriend.

02:50.652 --> 02:51.953
All right, finish up here.

02:53.254 --> 02:54.155
You got me.

03:03.799 --> 03:05.799
- Morning, guys.
- Simon, have a seat, honey.

03:05.867 --> 03:07.201
- Morning, Simon.
- You gotta eat your breakfast.

03:07.271 --> 03:08.170
Please don't tell me

03:08.604 --> 03:09.804
that breakfast is the most
important meal of the day

03:09.938 --> 03:11.939
because that is just so cliché.
You're better than that.

03:12.206 --> 03:14.272
I was gonna say breakfast
lowers LDL cholesterol

03:14.342 --> 03:16.178
and prevents
fluctuating glucose levels

03:16.245 --> 03:17.878
- that lead to type two diabetes.
- Oh!

03:18.646 --> 03:19.546
Touché.

03:20.115 --> 03:22.250
Nora. These are incredible.

03:22.350 --> 03:24.418
Cornmeal pancakes
with blackberry compote.

03:25.319 --> 03:26.487
But they're not crumbly enough.

03:26.589 --> 03:28.655
Stop it. They're perfect.

03:29.957 --> 03:30.925
Eat up, Bieber.

03:32.527 --> 03:33.627
- See you, guys.
- See you, Simon.

03:33.795 --> 03:35.897
Hey, honey. Be back
by seven! It's TV night.

03:48.910 --> 03:49.811
Hey!

03:50.210 --> 03:51.110
Morning!

03:51.513 --> 03:53.580
It's Simon! I live right here!

03:55.216 --> 03:56.684
I like your boots!

04:00.088 --> 04:00.988
Okay, bye!

04:09.364 --> 04:10.598
God damn.

04:31.353 --> 04:32.987
Had the craziest dream
last night.

04:33.055 --> 04:35.088
Hey, Nick, you have the
craziest dream every night.

04:35.189 --> 04:36.689
You don't understand.
I'm in this cave, right?

04:36.759 --> 04:37.825
Or maybe it's in outer space.

04:38.094 --> 04:39.661
David Beckham is there
with these two contact lenses

04:39.729 --> 04:42.295
and then like, blue one or
red one, like he's a sexy

04:42.430 --> 04:43.596
Morpheus from <i>Matrix.</i>

04:43.697 --> 04:44.898
And I don't know
which one to pick.

04:44.966 --> 04:46.601
I don't know what to do
with these things.

04:46.836 --> 04:49.270
Oh, my God. Have you guys seen
<i>Creek Secrets</i> today?

04:49.371 --> 04:51.572
First of all, you are obsessed
with that blog, so...

04:51.641 --> 04:53.307
Okay, but apparently,
Becca Peterson

04:53.375 --> 04:55.009
got caught giving
Ryan O'Donovan,

04:55.077 --> 04:56.010
an HJ in the pool.

04:56.079 --> 04:57.778
That's the real reason
they drained it.

04:57.847 --> 04:59.314
Man, our janitor needs a raise.

04:59.381 --> 05:00.281
Oh, my God.

05:00.415 --> 05:01.716
And an HPV vaccine.

05:02.549 --> 05:03.650
Leah, I have this dream,
right?

05:03.784 --> 05:05.253
Nick, we have a rule,
remember?

05:05.322 --> 05:07.056
No analyzing dreams
before coffee.

05:10.992 --> 05:12.093
Hi, could we get
four iced coffees, please?

05:12.260 --> 05:14.294
Oh, could you get Abby's
with milk? She likes milk.

05:14.696 --> 05:16.662
- One with milk.
- What are you, her barista?

05:17.197 --> 05:20.166
It's not hard
to remember "with milk."

05:24.605 --> 05:25.706
Thank you.

- Hey.

05:38.285 --> 05:41.155
Oh, thank you.
I am figuratively dying.

05:41.224 --> 05:42.956
So, Abby, last night I dreamt

05:43.089 --> 05:44.656
I put the wrong contacts
in my eyes.

05:44.726 --> 05:46.793
- Another dream. You're like...
- Hmm.

05:46.860 --> 05:48.061
You're like the love child of

05:48.129 --> 05:50.530
Sigmund Freud
and Cristiano Ronaldo.

05:50.700 --> 05:52.233
- Oh, my God.
- Thanks.

05:52.466 --> 05:53.866
Now, look. I can't see anything

05:53.935 --> 05:55.536
and I'm stumbling around
in this cave,

05:55.603 --> 05:58.037
crashing into stuff,
and then, I wake up.

05:58.406 --> 06:00.074
- That's it?
- Yeah.

06:00.675 --> 06:02.341
Maybe it's something that
you're not seeing clearly.

06:02.409 --> 06:04.644
Like something that's, like,
right in front of your face.

06:05.181 --> 06:06.315
What am I not seeing?

06:07.281 --> 06:08.882
No idea.

06:49.893 --> 06:51.260
But I get to be
slutty Charmander.

06:51.359 --> 06:52.525
Cool scarf, Ethan.

06:52.726 --> 06:54.193
Hope it doesn't get caught
in your vagina.

06:54.329 --> 06:56.329
Great choice on
the cargo pants, by the way.

06:56.399 --> 06:59.100
It looks like you got
gangbanged by a T.J. Maxx.

06:59.302 --> 07:00.636
Whatever, fag.

07:02.238 --> 07:05.373
Honestly, it's just
not even a challenge anymore.

07:05.674 --> 07:06.606
Dicks.

07:06.907 --> 07:08.608
Wish Ethan wouldn't make it
so easy for them.

07:08.911 --> 07:09.911
Yeah, well, at my old school,

07:10.178 --> 07:11.478
that would have been settled
with a knife fight.

07:11.879 --> 07:15.648
Good morning, Creekwood High!

07:15.717 --> 07:17.051
Come on, phones off!

07:17.118 --> 07:18.618
There's a whole world
to look at!

07:18.952 --> 07:20.687
You can look people
in the eyes!

07:20.822 --> 07:22.956
Gah! Yeah.

07:23.158 --> 07:24.624
Stop with the selfies.
You're not all that.

07:24.725 --> 07:26.160
- I'll see you guys at lunch.
- Yeah.

07:26.795 --> 07:28.795
Wow! Simonay.

07:28.931 --> 07:30.365
Look at those new kicks,
my brother.

07:30.431 --> 07:32.365
Where'd you get those? Where
could I get a pair of those?

07:32.732 --> 07:33.932
- I forget. Sorry.
- You forget?

07:33.999 --> 07:35.500
Come on, you gotta let me
know the brand!

07:35.571 --> 07:36.838
I want to be sneaker brothers.

07:36.971 --> 07:40.906
Oh, I see more phones!
Who took your phones now?

07:40.974 --> 07:45.676
Me! Me! Me took your phones now!
You can get 'em at my office!

07:46.113 --> 07:48.646
I can't believe we have to be
off book, in like, two weeks.

07:48.816 --> 07:50.818
Seriously, Sally Bowles
never shuts the eff up.

07:51.119 --> 07:52.652
Don't you wish
you were talentless like me?

07:52.721 --> 07:53.820
Here. Let me show you
a thing or two.

07:54.156 --> 07:55.555
Because then you could
just be living the easy life

07:55.623 --> 07:56.724
as company member
number eight.

07:58.225 --> 07:59.893
Well, well, well...

08:00.360 --> 08:02.460
If it isn't my fellow thespians.

08:03.498 --> 08:04.398
Hey, Martin.

08:04.599 --> 08:06.866
Hey, Spier. Hey, Abby.

08:07.235 --> 08:07.935
Hi.

08:08.170 --> 08:10.105
Excited to rehearse
with you later.

08:11.439 --> 08:12.306
Hey, uh, so, fun fact.

08:12.607 --> 08:14.541
You know that <i>Cabaret</i>
was actually based off a play

08:14.609 --> 08:15.811
called <i>I Am Camera?</i>

08:15.878 --> 08:17.577
Then <i>I Am a Camera</i>
was based off

08:17.644 --> 08:19.812
this novel called
<i>Goodbye to Berlin.</i>

08:19.880 --> 08:22.180
And <i>Goodbye to Berlin</i>
was actually based off

08:22.316 --> 08:23.484
Christopher Isherwood's

08:23.919 --> 08:25.652
early years in Berlin.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.786
Wow. That's awesome.
I have homeroom.

08:27.856 --> 08:28.756
Yeah. All right.

08:28.991 --> 08:30.457
Well, I think she
found that interesting.

08:30.525 --> 08:31.424
Bye, Martin.

08:31.892 --> 08:33.491
Bye, big boy.

08:34.828 --> 08:37.030
Suraj! Now.

08:38.499 --> 08:40.000
Come on. You know the drill.

08:41.102 --> 08:43.602
<i>I've had an inspiration.
How about</i> The Affair?

08:44.105 --> 08:46.507
No. No. We cannot watch
<i>The Affair</i> as a family.

08:46.609 --> 08:48.976
- Why not?
- Because it's all about sex.

08:49.211 --> 08:51.513
Oh, well, God forbid we should
watch people make love.

08:51.579 --> 08:52.478
Oh, God.

08:52.679 --> 08:54.948
Oh, my God.
You guys are so repressed.

08:55.218 --> 08:58.184
Don't therapize us, okay?
We are not your patients.

08:58.252 --> 08:59.453
- We're your family.
- That's true.

08:59.688 --> 09:01.855
If you were my patients, you'd
be much more well-adjusted.

09:01.924 --> 09:04.191
- Oh. Nice therapy burn, baby.
- Thank you.

09:04.592 --> 09:05.859
- She got you.
- You know what?

09:05.994 --> 09:07.961
We didn't see last week's
episode of <i>The Bachelor.</i>

09:08.196 --> 09:10.062
Yeah, how did that guy
even become the bachelor?

09:10.130 --> 09:10.829
Why?

09:10.931 --> 09:12.531
Well, he's clearly gay.

09:12.867 --> 09:14.535
- No, he's not.
- Really?

09:14.637 --> 09:15.603
- He's handsome.
- That date,

09:15.671 --> 09:16.571
where he took the girl to

09:16.705 --> 09:17.938
the "make your
own perfume" place?

09:18.004 --> 09:19.837
Dad! The producers
plan those dates.

09:19.907 --> 09:21.108
He is so fruity.
He's so fruity.

09:21.177 --> 09:23.243
He's a one-man pride parade.
Are you kidding me?

09:23.377 --> 09:24.910
- He has more chemistry
- Just stop it.

09:24.978 --> 09:27.412
with Chris Harrison,
than any of those girls.

09:28.949 --> 09:30.617
After this, I gotta
show you something.

09:31.052 --> 09:32.418
Okay?
Let's watch <i>The Americans.</i>

09:32.486 --> 09:34.687
Every single episode,
you here next to me.

09:34.756 --> 09:36.156
So your mother decided
that we should make

09:36.224 --> 09:37.590
each other anniversary
presents this year.

09:37.657 --> 09:40.026
You know, so they came
from the heart, or some crap.

09:40.162 --> 09:42.595
Anyway, I decided to come up
with this bad boy.

09:42.696 --> 09:43.596
Look at this.

09:43.830 --> 09:46.498
I present to you,
a Jack Spier production.

09:48.371 --> 09:51.239
<i>♪ I don't need to be the king
Of the world ♪</i>

09:51.372 --> 09:52.271
Wait, wait.

09:53.208 --> 09:54.107

09:54.542 --> 09:55.976
Oh, it's so good.

09:56.043 --> 10:01.480

Wait, wait, wait.

10:04.117 --> 10:06.219
<i>♪ Heaven isn't too far away ♪</i>

10:06.290 --> 10:07.322
Yup. Okay.

10:08.823 --> 10:09.723
What are you...

10:09.958 --> 10:12.357
Look, this is your
20th anniversary,

10:12.427 --> 10:14.361
so I'm gonna be super real
with you right now.

10:14.862 --> 10:16.397
This looks

10:16.530 --> 10:19.097
And not even the smartest
fourth grader in the class.

10:19.235 --> 10:20.935

a deeply average fourth grader.

10:21.001 --> 10:22.802

This is amazing.

10:22.936 --> 10:24.970
I got fade-ins.
I got dissolves.

10:25.075 --> 10:26.609
- This is beautiful.
- Get up for a second.

10:26.675 --> 10:27.975
I'll help you. Trust me.

10:28.209 --> 10:30.210
We can make this good.
We just gotta put in...

10:30.810 --> 10:32.410
you know, some home video.

10:32.982 --> 10:35.717
Maybe put in some better music.

10:35.949 --> 10:38.351
"Better music"? This was huge
when we were young.

10:38.587 --> 10:40.621
Yeah. So was Bill Cosby.

the Oakwood Tigers

15:09.423 --> 15:11.256
Garrett, I'm not gonna
shave my legs.

15:11.424 --> 15:13.558

It actually is.

15:48.594 --> 15:50.629
I got a really hot date
on Tinder tonight.

15:50.830 --> 15:52.095
She is cute!

15:52.601 --> 15:56.901

15:56.903 --> 15:58.170

We like to go out.
We like to have a good time.

16:00.407 --> 16:02.274
We like to have sex.
That's not a big deal, right?

16:02.341 --> 16:03.576
Yeah, no. No biggie at all.

16:03.643 --> 16:05.311

my phone though?

16:10.550 --> 16:11.817
No. Unfortunately, I'm gonna

<i>And for the record,</i>

22:12.611 --> 22:13.979
<i>I think Jon Snow
is an excellent choice</i>

22:14.146 --> 22:14.945
<i>for your sexual awakening.</i>

22:15.147 --> 22:16.847
<i>So I guess, if I want
to find you at school</i>

22:16.915 --> 22:19.117
<i>I just have to look for
the</i> Game of Thrones <i>fanatic.</i>

22:31.097 --> 22:31.796
Wow.

22:32.198 --> 22:34.166
<i>I was just listening to that
M83 song "Reunion,"</i>

22:34.234 --> 22:35.468
<i>and it made me think of you.</i>

22:35.869 --> 22:37.770
<i>You'll probably think
my music taste is lame.</i>

22:38.305 --> 22:39.805
<i>Kind of have the same taste
as my Aunt Sally</i>

22:39.872 --> 22:41.506
<i>who loves show tunes.</i>

22:41.741 --> 22:43.675
<i>Obviously, some of the things
I've told you about myself</i>

22:43.811 --> 22:46.278
<i>are things I've never
talked about with anyone.</i>

22:47.080 --> 22:48.812
<i>There's something about you
that makes me want to open up.</i>

22:49.081 --> 22:50.849
<i>And that's
slightly terrifying for me.</i>

22:50.917 --> 22:51.916
<i>So I've been thinking,</i>

22:52.051 --> 22:53.686
<i>maybe I should be Jon Snow
for Halloween.</i>

22:53.919 --> 22:56.055
<i>What about you?
Who are you gonna be?</i>

22:57.190 --> 22:59.358
<i>I'm not dressing up.
For me,</i>

22:59.592 --> 23:00.692
<i>Halloween's all about
the Oreos</i>

23:00.760 --> 23:02.328
<i>with the orange frosting
in the middle.</i>

23:04.263 --> 23:05.831
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey.

23:05.899 --> 23:08.398
Wow. Look at that smile.
You're glowing, man.

23:08.467 --> 23:09.367
No.

23:09.435 --> 23:10.435
You are glowing.
You look happy.

23:10.503 --> 23:11.502
Oh, just regular.

23:11.572 --> 23:12.738
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

23:12.806 --> 23:15.040
Me too. I'm a little meh.

23:16.142 --> 23:17.040
Why "meh"?

23:17.277 --> 23:20.713
Oh, I had my big Tinder date
last night. Oh, God.

23:20.847 --> 23:22.981
She was not into it.

23:23.481 --> 23:24.749
At. All.

23:26.387 --> 23:28.020
- Oh, come on. Too soon.
- No.

23:28.219 --> 23:29.420
The bell is a buzzkill.

23:29.489 --> 23:30.957
- See you, Mr. Worth.
- All right.

23:33.591 --> 23:34.959
Well, thank you
for your help, <i>Fräulein.</i>

23:35.029 --> 23:35.728
You're welcome.

23:36.227 --> 23:39.697
German accent for <i>Cabaret.</i>
Yup. Take care, Ms. Bradley.

23:41.067 --> 23:41.966
Ladies.

23:43.471 --> 23:46.204
Let's see what you got,
interwebs.

23:52.613 --> 23:53.779
Here are
your burnt tots,

23:53.847 --> 23:55.781
because you have
horrible taste.

23:56.683 --> 23:57.682
Here's your
green banana,

23:57.750 --> 23:59.184
because you like
disgusting things.

23:59.719 --> 24:00.619
Wow, you guys are weird.

24:00.886 --> 24:03.386
Yup. They're practically
Cantonese twins.

24:03.722 --> 24:05.658
- Siamese.
- Yeah. Siamese.

24:06.292 --> 24:07.025
Yeah, agree to disagree.

24:07.226 --> 24:08.560
I don't think
that's one of those things

24:08.628 --> 24:09.627
where you can
agree to disagree.

24:09.696 --> 24:10.597
- ...disagree.
- It's just right.

24:10.664 --> 24:11.864
To each his own.

24:13.298 --> 24:14.198
Oreos.

24:15.401 --> 24:16.400
Man, I love those.

24:16.901 --> 24:18.202
Halloween ones
are the best, right?

24:18.270 --> 24:19.171
Yeah.

24:20.572 --> 24:21.907
Er, so, guys, I have great news.

24:21.974 --> 24:23.742
My aunt's boyfriend
just took off

24:23.811 --> 24:25.511
with her car
and all her jewelry.

24:25.578 --> 24:27.179
Bram, that's terrible news!

24:27.244 --> 24:27.945
I know, but it's like,

24:28.115 --> 24:29.048
the third time
it's happened to her.

24:29.116 --> 24:30.816
She has really bad taste in men.

24:31.383 --> 24:34.886
Anyways, my mom is going down
to Orlando to deal with it

24:34.954 --> 24:38.022
which means I get to throw
a Halloween party.

24:38.626 --> 24:39.992
- Awesome!
- Yay!

24:40.059 --> 24:40.759
Nice!

24:40.927 --> 24:42.693
Thank you,
Bram's dumb-ass aunt!

24:42.828 --> 24:44.430
All right, this is
gonna be epic, you guys.

24:44.529 --> 24:45.930
I can bring
my karaoke machine.

24:46.065 --> 24:47.932
All right, hey, guys,
Halloween party Friday night!

24:48.535 --> 24:50.036
Friday night, Halloween party,
okay? Bram's house!

24:50.103 --> 24:51.769
You really set this
in motion, man.

24:51.837 --> 24:52.736
I know, right?

24:52.805 --> 24:53.805
- Hey, little guy.
- Me?

24:54.140 --> 24:56.607
Halloween party. Friday night.
Bram's house. Be there.

24:56.943 --> 24:58.076
You're gonna
freak him out, man.

24:58.143 --> 24:58.843
Yeah.

24:59.112 --> 25:00.211
I know.
He's, like, nine years old.

25:08.219 --> 25:10.654
<i>Very relieved that
we're in agreement on Oreos.</i>

25:10.724 --> 25:12.824
<i>That would have been
a deal-breaker for me.</i>

25:13.259 --> 25:17.295
<i>On a totally different,
non-cookie related note...</i>

25:17.830 --> 25:20.263
<i>is it weird that I have no idea
what you look like,</i>

25:20.332 --> 25:23.502
but I can't stop thinking
about kissing you.

25:25.271 --> 25:27.438
Simon. Simon.

25:28.774 --> 25:30.008
Eyes on your own test.

25:39.618 --> 25:41.351
Don't stop on my account,
Rob and Brianne.

25:41.421 --> 25:43.355
That's the most action
I've seen in weeks.

25:43.422 --> 25:45.524
What do we got here? Ah!

25:45.591 --> 25:46.723
When we're done,
it's gonna look

25:46.891 --> 25:49.761
like a real German sex club.
Don't ask me how I know.

25:51.096 --> 25:54.198
Hey! Hey! The spray paint
is for painting,

25:54.267 --> 25:55.200
not for huffing.

25:55.701 --> 25:56.900
You don't want
to get good at that.

25:57.402 --> 25:58.970
Okay, do you guys think
I should dye my hair grey

25:59.037 --> 26:00.504
- to play <i>Fräulein</i> Schneider?
- Sure.

26:01.174 --> 26:02.675
Really? But my hair
is kind of like my thing.

26:02.741 --> 26:03.975
I'm gonna go get a soda.

26:04.542 --> 26:05.511
Do you want anything?

26:05.744 --> 26:06.642
No.

26:06.712 --> 26:08.079
You disgust me.

26:16.588 --> 26:18.822
Simon! Hey, hey, hey.

26:18.892 --> 26:20.159
- Hey, Martin.
- Buddy.

26:20.626 --> 26:24.028
Hey, um, I used the computer
in the library right after you.

26:24.896 --> 26:25.864
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

26:26.231 --> 26:29.634
Well, I went to Gmail,
and it pulled up your account.

26:29.969 --> 26:31.802
And I, uh, read
some of your emails.

26:31.902 --> 26:33.036
I know
I probably shouldn't've,

26:33.106 --> 26:34.873
but they were, like,
right there.

26:35.142 --> 26:37.242
So you'll be interested
to know my brother's gay.

26:40.946 --> 26:43.880
No. Martin, that wouldn't
interest me to know.

26:44.315 --> 26:46.149
Okay. Don't worry.
I won't show anyone.

26:47.520 --> 26:48.555
Show anyone what?

26:51.156 --> 26:52.691
Did you print my emails
or something?

26:52.824 --> 26:54.892
Oh, no, no.

26:55.427 --> 26:56.860
I screenshot them.

26:56.961 --> 26:59.128
- You screenshotted my emails?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

26:59.197 --> 27:00.431
Let me talk to you for a second.

27:01.901 --> 27:03.735
- Oh, Ms. Bradley.
- Hello, Martin.

27:03.802 --> 27:05.469
- Did you feather your hair?
- No.

27:06.338 --> 27:07.239
Looking good.

27:08.442 --> 27:09.409
This is a good section.

27:10.777 --> 27:11.674
Jeez.

27:12.278 --> 27:14.278
Now, why the hell
did you screenshot my emails?

27:14.681 --> 27:17.748
Ah, well, you and Abby Susso
are good friends. Right?

27:17.817 --> 27:18.817
Yeah. We know each other.

27:18.951 --> 27:19.884
What does that have to do
with anything?

27:20.120 --> 27:22.853
Well, I need you to help me
talk with her...

27:23.288 --> 27:25.289
and hang out with her
and stuff, you know?

27:25.525 --> 27:27.024
Why would I help you do that?

27:28.861 --> 27:29.994
Are you blackmailing me?

27:30.062 --> 27:32.896
Oh, shh! Okay. Don't be
so dramatic here, Simon.

27:32.966 --> 27:33.933
Sup, Tyler?

27:34.199 --> 27:36.167
What's up, Tyler?
Is that a Patagonia?

27:36.836 --> 27:39.371
Nice. I just like her.

27:39.673 --> 27:42.474
And I think
that you could help me.

27:42.941 --> 27:44.775
Yeah, what if I say no, Martin?

27:44.845 --> 27:45.812
I mean, what are you gonna do?

27:46.012 --> 27:47.146
You gonna tell the whole school
that I'm...

27:47.913 --> 27:49.047
You're gonna leak my emails?

27:49.115 --> 27:50.815
You're gonna post 'em
on <i>CreekSecrets?</i>

27:50.883 --> 27:52.784
I just think
that we're in a position here,

27:53.420 --> 27:55.154
where we could help
each other out is all.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.254
So think about it.

27:58.290 --> 27:59.191
Good talk.

28:06.865 --> 28:08.900
You know, I never thought
of a pepper

28:08.968 --> 28:10.067
as being a vegetable...

28:10.135 --> 28:11.102
...but it makes perfect sense.

28:11.536 --> 28:14.706
I like the cilantro.
A little Mexican flair, huh?

28:14.939 --> 28:16.238
Very creative, kiddo.

28:16.742 --> 28:18.744
You hate the peppers.
Don't you?

28:19.245 --> 28:21.312
No. The peppers are great.

28:22.715 --> 28:24.015
I'm just gonna get some air.

28:34.827 --> 28:37.627
<i>Jacques, I have to get
something off my chest.</i>

28:37.963 --> 28:39.097
<i>The other day, you asked me</i>

28:39.165 --> 28:40.332
<i>what I was wearing
for Halloween</i>

28:40.399 --> 28:42.967
<i>and I said
I wasn't dressing up.</i>

28:43.568 --> 28:44.935
<i>I lied. Truth is,</i>

28:45.004 --> 28:46.538
<i>I didn't want you to know
what I was wearing</i>

28:46.605 --> 28:49.106
<i>because I don't want you
to know who I am.</i>

28:50.843 --> 28:51.776
<i>Right now, these emails,</i>

28:51.977 --> 28:54.078
<i>they feel like
this totally safe place.</i>

28:54.712 --> 28:56.912
<i>I'm just not ready
for my whole world to change.</i>

28:57.181 --> 28:58.415
<i>I hope you understand.</i>

29:06.123 --> 29:08.459
<i>Yes, Blue. I understand.</i>

29:27.113 --> 29:28.546
Okay, if you want me
to help you with Abby,

29:28.713 --> 29:29.713
you cannot eat that.

29:30.183 --> 29:31.383
So you're gonna help me?

29:31.817 --> 29:32.719
Yeah.

29:35.854 --> 29:38.655
Simon, that is fantastic news.

29:38.923 --> 29:40.891
I really think that Abby and I
are meant to be together.

29:40.959 --> 29:42.192
- Really? Do you?
- Mm-hmm.

29:42.260 --> 29:43.527
It's not all about looks, Simon.

29:43.596 --> 29:46.130
Okay. So you're banking
on your great,

29:46.197 --> 29:48.231
blackmaily personality
to get the job done?

29:48.301 --> 29:50.269
- Where are we going?
- Your place.

29:50.402 --> 29:51.736
We're gonna see
if you have anything

29:51.803 --> 29:53.237
that doesn't scream,
"punch me."

29:53.406 --> 29:55.307
Actually, I've got swim lessons.

29:55.806 --> 29:56.706
Cancel it!

29:57.378 --> 29:59.579
Okay, I just have to
call my mom first.

29:59.645 --> 30:02.113
She has to approve everybody
that comes in the house.

30:03.215 --> 30:05.150
All right. Here we go.

30:06.784 --> 30:09.253
All right. And here we are.

30:10.755 --> 30:11.821
This is where the magic happens.

30:11.889 --> 30:12.790
Wow.

30:13.125 --> 30:15.626
Ooh. Correction.

30:16.163 --> 30:18.463
This is where the magic happens.

30:20.031 --> 30:21.764
I've been dabbling
in close-up illusions.

30:22.099 --> 30:23.099
Does Abby like magic?

30:23.469 --> 30:25.303
No. Martin, I don't think
she does like magic.

30:25.372 --> 30:26.805
But, um,
there's a really thin line

30:26.872 --> 30:30.106
between laughing with someone,
and laughing at someone.

30:30.576 --> 30:31.509
And you are that line.

30:31.575 --> 30:33.076
So,
if you want Abby to like you,

30:33.144 --> 30:34.377
what you have to do
is you have to

30:34.447 --> 30:35.980
make her see you
as more of a...

30:36.047 --> 30:37.415
As sexy Martin!

30:38.050 --> 30:40.318
Yeah! Yeah, I could be sexy.

30:42.656 --> 30:44.222
You like dudes. Tell me.

30:44.524 --> 30:45.990
What part of me
do you find the hottest?

30:46.056 --> 30:48.024
- No. I'm not doing this.
- No. Come on.

30:48.092 --> 30:49.427
No, Martin.
I don't want to answer that.

30:49.495 --> 30:50.928
Look, if you said my shoulders

30:51.062 --> 30:53.465
I would dress to accentuate.
You know?

30:54.001 --> 30:55.468
You know what?
Here's your first tip.

30:55.768 --> 30:56.468
Ripped.

30:56.769 --> 30:59.771
Girls, they don't want
to read your clothes.

30:59.973 --> 31:01.373
I think you're wrong
about that one.

31:02.274 --> 31:03.442
How many of these do you have?

31:04.241 --> 31:07.211
Please, just stop! Hey! Stop!

31:07.579 --> 31:10.115
Look, I don't want your help
in changing me.

31:10.816 --> 31:14.385
I want your help in getting
Abby to like me for me.

31:16.954 --> 31:18.155
Look. Um...

31:20.026 --> 31:22.861
there's a party this Saturday.
At Bram's.

31:25.564 --> 31:27.198
Do you want to go
with my friends and I?

31:27.766 --> 31:28.667
Yes!

31:29.069 --> 31:31.036
Yes! So simple.

31:31.735 --> 31:33.570
Must be why
they call you Simple Simon.

31:33.839 --> 31:35.407
Nobody calls me that, Martin.

31:36.308 --> 31:38.710
Hey, uh, do you want to,
like, sleep over?

31:39.144 --> 31:40.245
Nope.

31:50.489 --> 31:51.555
Oh, hello.

31:52.057 --> 31:53.256
Hey, what's up?

31:53.393 --> 31:54.794
- Nice, right?
- Nick.

31:54.860 --> 31:55.560
Good?

31:55.994 --> 31:58.061
This is, like, a new level of
laziness, even for you.

31:58.261 --> 32:00.796
What do you mean?
I'm Cristiano Ronaldo.

32:00.865 --> 32:01.866
And you couldn't
even be bothered

32:01.934 --> 32:03.402
to fill in the letters
on the back?

32:03.835 --> 32:05.603
No, come on. Give me that.

32:06.538 --> 32:08.672
You are a bully.

32:08.740 --> 32:12.141
Hey. Don't
talk about Yoko that way, man.

32:12.377 --> 32:14.712
Because if you do,
you're out of the band.

32:14.980 --> 32:16.280
Who are you guys
supposed to be?

32:18.082 --> 32:19.381
John Lennon and Yoko Ono.

32:19.852 --> 32:21.919
Oh! I thought she was the girl
from <i>The Ring,</i>

32:22.053 --> 32:23.220
and you were Jesus.

32:23.389 --> 32:26.622
Jesus? No. Why would Jesus be
wearing a white suit?

32:26.925 --> 32:27.893
I don't know. You tell me.

32:28.327 --> 32:29.827
You're the one who decided to
dress up like fancy Jesus.

32:30.061 --> 32:31.294
Oh, my God. Okay. Come here.

32:31.494 --> 32:32.695
- Turn around.
- I'm here.

32:32.764 --> 32:33.764
- Turn around.
- Okay.

32:34.434 --> 32:35.334
- Okay.
- Is it good?

32:35.399 --> 32:36.299
- Way better.
- Is it?

32:36.667 --> 32:37.934
Yeah. Now, we need to do
something about this hair.

32:37.970 --> 32:39.069
Maybe slick it back?

32:39.239 --> 32:41.173
It doesn't do that.
It doesn't slick back.

32:41.807 --> 32:42.839
Wonder Woman in the hizzy!

32:42.907 --> 32:43.908
Hi!

32:44.710 --> 32:45.542
I made up a catchphrase,

32:45.609 --> 32:47.310
'cause Wonder Woman
doesn't have one.

32:48.780 --> 32:49.681
"Hizzy" means house.

32:49.914 --> 32:50.946
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:51.015 --> 32:52.216
- Right. Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:52.884 --> 32:54.385
Oh, Abby, you look amazing.

32:54.620 --> 32:55.520
Thank you!

32:56.822 --> 32:58.256
Yeah. You look awesome.

32:59.091 --> 33:00.624
I'm gonna go make
those frozen pizzas.

33:01.127 --> 33:02.025
All right.

33:02.127 --> 33:03.428
Yeah, I'll help.

33:05.163 --> 33:06.496
That's a nice costume, for real.

33:06.565 --> 33:09.167
Thank you.
What? Cristiano Ronaldo!

33:09.234 --> 33:10.335
Nailed it.

33:11.070 --> 33:12.102
Do you remember
when we went to school

33:12.168 --> 33:13.236
dressed as Charlie's Angels?

33:13.340 --> 33:14.572
Oh, my God, yes.

33:14.707 --> 33:16.373
And Nick's balls fell out
of his booty shorts

33:16.441 --> 33:18.275
when he, like, dropped down
to do the gun pose?

33:19.512 --> 33:21.412
Mm. Do you miss
trick-or-treating?

33:21.546 --> 33:22.813
What, you mean
instead of, like,

33:22.880 --> 33:23.680
going to loud parties

33:23.749 --> 33:25.083
pretending to like
the taste of beer

33:25.149 --> 33:26.715
and feeling too self-conscious
to dance?

33:27.318 --> 33:28.519
I don't know why
you feel self-conscious.

33:28.619 --> 33:31.053
I mean, you are very clearly

33:31.123 --> 33:32.691
the coolest person
at our school.

33:34.027 --> 33:36.428
I'm pretty sure you're
the only one who feels that way.

33:37.630 --> 33:38.530
But thank you.

33:44.268 --> 33:45.370
Who's that?

33:46.138 --> 33:47.170
I invited Martin.

33:47.372 --> 33:48.973
- Martin Addison?
- Why?

33:49.108 --> 33:50.708
Is this a Make-A-Wish situation?

33:52.411 --> 33:53.511
No, he's cool.

33:55.580 --> 33:56.679
Hey.

33:57.815 --> 33:59.250
Oh, looking sharp.

33:59.752 --> 34:00.452
What the...

34:00.752 --> 34:02.853
- Guys.
- What are you supposed to be?

34:03.155 --> 34:04.388
Isn't it obvious?

34:05.257 --> 34:07.424
Ah! I'm a Freudian slip.

34:09.494 --> 34:11.661
Abby. Wonder Woman.

34:15.965 --> 34:17.299
Just pick a song already.

34:17.701 --> 34:19.870
Hey, Nick, uh,
can you not rush me?

34:21.705 --> 34:23.205
Honestly, I can't
choose. There's so many.

34:23.274 --> 34:24.174
That's like Netflix.

34:24.409 --> 34:26.277
You know, trying to pick
a film on Netflix.

34:26.579 --> 34:29.481
I'm like...
"Am I in an Apatow mood,

34:29.547 --> 34:32.181
or am I in a Billy Wilder
mood?" You know?

34:32.250 --> 34:33.985
Ooh, play Drake. Yes.

34:34.152 --> 34:37.286
Uh, no. Drake is, like,
super played out at this point.

34:37.856 --> 34:40.159
You can't play out a rap god.
Doesn't happen.

34:40.226 --> 34:41.156
Impossible.

34:41.257 --> 34:42.326
First of all,
he's not a rap god.

34:42.529 --> 34:44.429
And second of all,
I'm looking for some Beyoncé.

34:44.496 --> 34:46.063
- Oh.
- I just can't find "Lemonade."

34:46.130 --> 34:47.965
Hey. Here's an
interesting question.

34:48.032 --> 34:48.731
I love Beyoncé.

34:48.867 --> 34:50.033
What makes you guys
feel nostalgic?

34:50.100 --> 34:51.000
You do?

34:51.337 --> 34:52.603
I mean, I think everybody
kinda likes Beyoncé.

34:53.237 --> 34:55.172
Grape soda makes me
feel very nostalgic.

34:55.241 --> 34:57.808
- What are you talking about?
- What makes you feel nostalgic?

34:58.343 --> 34:59.242
Hey, Abby.

34:59.611 --> 35:01.578
I bet you're gonna have
the best costume tonight.

35:02.313 --> 35:04.315
- Thanks.
- Nah, you're welcome.

35:08.118 --> 35:09.218
What the hell, Spier?

35:09.354 --> 35:11.821
Hey, why is Nick
still flirting with Abby?

35:12.123 --> 35:13.057
I don't know, Martin.

35:13.191 --> 35:14.793
Maybe you shouldn't have
worn a dress.

35:15.560 --> 35:16.759
You look like a drag queen

35:16.826 --> 35:18.562
rolled around
in magnetic poetry.

35:21.132 --> 35:22.264
Hey, Abby!

35:22.534 --> 35:24.233
Whenever you need a refill
of your drink,

35:24.369 --> 35:25.969
I'll be
your designated bartender.

35:26.136 --> 35:27.103
So don't worry.

35:27.339 --> 35:29.540
Okay. Hey, Chloe, come here!

35:29.774 --> 35:31.006
Yo, yo, yo!

35:31.075 --> 35:33.510
Hey. John Lennon?

35:33.677 --> 35:35.178
- Yeah. You got it.
- Nice.

35:35.380 --> 35:37.449
And, um, Nick...

35:38.549 --> 35:41.384
- You're Nick.
- No. No. I'm Ronaldo.

35:41.452 --> 35:43.287
- Oh. My bad.
- Obviously.

35:43.555 --> 35:44.455
Who are you supposed to be?

35:44.756 --> 35:47.891
Oh. Uh... I am post-presidency
Barack Obama.

35:48.025 --> 35:50.526
So I'm just chillin' in
Hawaii, drinking Mai Tais,

35:50.595 --> 35:52.263
writing memoirs and hoping

35:52.330 --> 35:53.763
Trump doesn't destroy
my legacy.

35:53.832 --> 35:56.099
That's awesome.

35:56.768 --> 35:58.836
Thanks. Now let's go
to the bar. Come on.

35:59.237 --> 36:00.137
Yeah.

36:00.370 --> 36:01.270
Hell yeah.

36:02.006 --> 36:04.308
<i>♪ My name is
My sign is ♪</i>

36:04.377 --> 36:05.776

36:14.286 --> 36:15.918
All right, we should
have a little toast.

36:16.186 --> 36:17.087
No, thanks. I'm driving.

36:17.189 --> 36:18.055
And Simon doesn't
really drink.

36:18.122 --> 36:19.356
No, I drink. It's cool. I drink.

36:19.657 --> 36:20.990
- All right, that's my man.
- Really?

36:21.060 --> 36:22.025
You wouldn't even have a glass

36:22.094 --> 36:23.293
of Manischewitz
at Leah's Seder.

36:23.362 --> 36:25.829
It's Halloween, man.
It's a special occasion.

36:26.430 --> 36:27.530
True that.

36:28.166 --> 36:29.066
Cheers.

36:33.337 --> 36:34.504
You okay?

36:38.410 --> 36:40.011
You're good at this.
You got this.

36:43.916 --> 36:47.817
Abby is the hottest
Wonder Woman I have ever seen.

36:48.087 --> 36:48.786
Yeah.

36:49.287 --> 36:50.887
The shit that I would let her
do to me with that lasso.

36:50.954 --> 36:51.854
Oh, I know, man.

36:51.923 --> 36:54.424
Just, like, tie me up
with that thing.

36:54.626 --> 36:56.059
You're not into Abby, are you?

36:56.294 --> 36:57.327
No, no, no.

36:57.428 --> 36:59.763
I mean, it's not like I...
She's cute...

36:59.830 --> 37:00.529
Yeah.

37:00.664 --> 37:01.865
...but she's just not really
my type.

37:03.101 --> 37:06.168
Not because she's black.
I love black women.

37:06.504 --> 37:08.572
Not like, you know, I have
a thing for black women,

37:08.641 --> 37:10.708
I just love all women.

37:13.178 --> 37:14.979
- Oh, oh. Oh!
- Oh!

37:15.213 --> 37:18.615
- Oh, hey.
- Hey! Oh, hey.

37:19.284 --> 37:21.819
Hey. Mm.

37:23.455 --> 37:25.722
- I'm gonna go ask her out.
- What? No.

37:26.224 --> 37:27.257
- No? No?
- No.

37:27.558 --> 37:29.192
- You can't ask Abby out.
- Why not?

37:30.027 --> 37:34.096
Because. She didn't tell you
about Jonathan?

37:34.366 --> 37:35.298
She didn't tell you about that?

37:35.367 --> 37:36.333
- No.
- He's older.

37:36.566 --> 37:38.668
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- In college.

37:39.036 --> 37:40.570
He's really experienced.

37:43.042 --> 37:44.442
You know I've only had sex
once, right?

37:44.509 --> 37:45.407
I know that.

37:45.575 --> 37:46.575
You know,
it's like no one tells you

37:46.642 --> 37:47.644
how dark everything is

37:47.912 --> 37:50.346
and how slippery everything
gets, and, you know,

37:50.413 --> 37:51.448
the parts you think
are the right parts

37:51.515 --> 37:52.783
are actually
the wrong parts and...

37:54.585 --> 37:56.653
All right, I'm gonna go eat
my feelings away.

37:58.088 --> 37:58.788
Man, I'm sorry...

37:59.057 --> 38:00.257
No, it's okay.
Don't worry about it.

38:02.960 --> 38:03.861
Whoa, whoa.

38:08.633 --> 38:09.667
- Hey, Simon!
- Hey.

38:09.800 --> 38:11.200
Hey, you wanna play Beirut?

38:11.436 --> 38:12.468
Yeah. Sure.

38:12.869 --> 38:14.270
We just need two more people.

38:14.340 --> 38:16.807
How about you and me,
and then, um...

38:17.841 --> 38:18.740
I insist.

38:18.977 --> 38:19.978
Abby and Martin?

38:20.746 --> 38:21.878
- Okay, cool.
- Hey, Martin.

38:21.947 --> 38:23.146
- Yeah.
- Abby.

38:23.481 --> 38:24.381
Let's play Beirut.

38:24.516 --> 38:25.915
- No, I don't...
- Yeah. Let's do it.

38:26.051 --> 38:28.619
Come on, let's go.
It'll be fun. It'll be fun.

38:28.787 --> 38:30.920
Good old competition.

38:31.387 --> 38:32.889
- Ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

38:34.126 --> 38:35.525
Beirut. Right?

38:35.593 --> 38:36.527
Yes!

38:36.727 --> 38:38.428
Okay. Have you ever played
Beirut before?

38:38.763 --> 38:40.096
Uh, totally. Yeah.

38:40.664 --> 38:43.800
Great. All right, so,
two reracks, no blowing

38:43.869 --> 38:44.834
and two balls in the cup means

38:44.903 --> 38:46.135
that you have to
take three, okay?

38:46.237 --> 38:47.270
Okay. Cool.

38:47.739 --> 38:49.639
I thought we were talking
about a different game.

38:50.074 --> 38:51.205
We'll just explain
as we go. Okay?

38:51.276 --> 38:52.176
- Yeah.
- Okay. Got it.

38:52.376 --> 38:53.276
Ready?

38:53.412 --> 38:55.746
- Maybe you should take these...
- Oh.

38:56.714 --> 38:59.181
- You'll see better. Right?
- Good idea. Yeah.

39:00.218 --> 39:01.618
- All you.
- Raindrop!

39:01.687 --> 39:03.354
Here we go, all right.
You got this one.

39:03.687 --> 39:05.186
Oh, is that...
This is mine to drink?

39:07.858 --> 39:08.759
God.

39:09.994 --> 39:10.893
Oh!

39:12.596 --> 39:13.497
All right.

39:13.564 --> 39:15.231
Chug! Chug! Chug!

39:17.434 --> 39:19.067
Do we need a handshake?
Is that...

39:19.371 --> 39:20.304
You get one of these in

39:20.404 --> 39:21.939
and we can totally have
a handshake.

39:22.607 --> 39:23.940
Fly it away. Fly it away.

39:25.309 --> 39:27.043
Chug, chug, chug.

39:27.378 --> 39:28.445

41:39.477 --> 41:40.376
Wait, what?

41:40.610 --> 41:43.045
- Dude, my parents are still up.
- Oh, God.

41:43.113 --> 41:45.047
- Oh...
- Okay, you know what... Come on.

41:45.982 --> 41:47.917
I need you to think of
something really sad...

41:47.984 --> 41:48.684
Uh-huh.

41:48.986 --> 41:50.819
Like, the documentary
about how all the whales

41:50.887 --> 41:51.988
hate living at SeaWorld.

41:52.055 --> 41:52.756
Too sad!

41:52.923 --> 41:53.989
God. Okay, then just,
you know what,

41:54.057 --> 41:54.991
don't say anything at all...

41:55.259 --> 41:57.560
And we'll ditch the barf shirt
till tomorrow.

41:57.629 --> 41:58.730
Okay.

41:59.830 --> 42:00.829
- Si?
- Yeah.

42:01.032 --> 42:02.832
Just as little
as possible,

42:02.901 --> 42:04.135
say as little as possible.

42:12.843 --> 42:14.243
So how does that work?

42:14.312 --> 42:16.346
I know, I remember
when I went to...

42:16.681 --> 42:17.882
Hey, guys!

42:18.617 --> 42:20.383
- Hey!
- Hey!

42:20.616 --> 42:21.750
- Come talk to us.
- Hey!

42:21.884 --> 42:23.953
- How was the party?
- It was really fun.

42:24.187 --> 42:25.086
- Was it?
- Yeah.

42:25.489 --> 42:26.389
Aces.

42:27.492 --> 42:29.861
Huh.

42:30.960 --> 42:33.228
Uh, well. Thanks for
letting me stay over.

42:33.297 --> 42:34.897
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

42:35.164 --> 42:36.499
You've been
staying over 10 years.

42:37.601 --> 42:38.735
You don't have to thank us.

42:38.802 --> 42:40.902
Oh. Yeah, thanks.

42:41.571 --> 42:43.005
Stop. Shh!

42:47.044 --> 42:48.378
John Lennon was wearing
a woman's sweater.

42:48.445 --> 42:49.812
- Mm.
- And he's drunk.

42:50.214 --> 42:51.781
- Definitely.
- So how do we feel about that?

42:51.848 --> 42:53.583
Well, he didn't drive drunk,

42:53.650 --> 42:55.283
and he's home
before curfew, so...

42:55.919 --> 42:58.021
Good. That's what I thought
we thought.

42:58.088 --> 42:59.954
Yeah, that's what
we think, right?

43:00.025 --> 43:01.559
- Yeah. We're good parents.
- Yeah, we're good parents.

43:01.625 --> 43:02.525
Right?

43:07.531 --> 43:08.832
The room stopped spinning.

43:19.976 --> 43:21.243
Do you ever feel weird?

43:23.247 --> 43:25.281
- Weird?
- Yeah.

43:28.453 --> 43:30.887
Sometimes I feel like
I'm always on the outside.

43:34.858 --> 43:35.957
What do you mean?

43:36.493 --> 43:38.196
Like tonight, you know...

43:38.764 --> 43:40.729
I was at that party,
and it was fun, but...

43:41.298 --> 43:44.067
it kinda felt like
I was watching it

43:44.133 --> 43:45.266
from across the room.

43:47.971 --> 43:49.572
I don't know,
there's this invisible line

43:49.641 --> 43:50.540
that I have to cross

43:50.673 --> 43:51.674
to really be a part
of everything

43:51.741 --> 43:53.410
and I just,
I can't ever cross it.

43:56.012 --> 43:57.847
I feel that way
sometimes, too.

43:58.817 --> 43:59.815
Not tonight you didn't.

44:00.049 --> 44:01.618
Yeah, I was trying something.

44:03.087 --> 44:04.689
Yeah, sometimes I think
it'd be so much easier

44:04.756 --> 44:07.356
to be one of these people who
can just take a few shots

44:07.425 --> 44:09.392
and then hook up
with whoever's closest.

44:11.562 --> 44:13.130
Yeah, I guess I'm just unlucky.

44:13.330 --> 44:14.231
Unlucky?

44:16.066 --> 44:16.967
Why?

44:18.035 --> 44:20.237
Because I'm not
a casual person.

44:21.705 --> 44:23.908
What kind of person are you?

44:28.845 --> 44:29.944
I think I'm the kind of person

44:30.012 --> 44:32.014
who is destined
to care so much

44:32.081 --> 44:34.083
about one person,
it nearly kills me.

44:39.490 --> 44:40.389
Me too.

44:48.399 --> 44:49.299
It's getting late.

45:05.516 --> 45:06.416
Si?

45:07.484 --> 45:08.384
Yeah?

45:08.587 --> 45:09.487
Good night.

45:11.521 --> 45:12.421
Good night.

45:34.444 --> 45:35.344
<i>Dear Blue,</i>

45:36.079 --> 45:37.881
<i>so one of my friends
likes the other,</i>

45:38.481 --> 45:41.549
<i>and he has no idea.
I guess we all have secrets.</i>

45:42.319 --> 45:43.686
<i>Anyway, I've been
thinking about</i>

45:43.754 --> 45:45.155
<i>why I haven't come out yet.</i>

45:45.990 --> 45:47.523
<i>Maybe it's because
it doesn't seem fair</i>

45:47.590 --> 45:49.659
<i>that only gay people
have to come out.</i>

45:49.726 --> 45:51.160
<i>Why is straight the default?</i>

45:52.062 --> 45:53.329
I have something
I need to tell you.

45:53.632 --> 45:56.332
Mom, there's something
I have to tell you.

45:56.534 --> 45:57.434
Can we talk?

45:57.501 --> 45:58.435
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

45:59.037 --> 45:59.935
I'm straight.

46:00.002 --> 46:00.902
I'm straight.

46:01.103 --> 46:02.739
I'm sorry, Mom, it's true.

46:03.540 --> 46:04.439
I like girls.

46:06.910 --> 46:07.810
I like men.

46:07.945 --> 46:09.312
You get that
from your daddy's side.

46:10.112 --> 46:11.647
I'm in love with Nick.

46:13.916 --> 46:15.616
I feel like I've been raising
a stranger.

46:15.687 --> 46:17.421
Yes, absolutely, you have.

46:17.687 --> 46:18.720
I'm heterosexual.

46:18.857 --> 46:21.591
Oh, God. Help me, Jesus. Please.

46:21.757 --> 46:23.524
<i>Or maybe it's because
I can't be sure</i>

46:23.594 --> 46:25.393
<i>this whole "being gay" thing
is forever.</i>

46:25.462 --> 46:27.096
<i>Or maybe it's that there's
not that much</i>

46:27.163 --> 46:28.064
<i>of high school left</i>

46:28.232 --> 46:29.398
<i>and part of me
wants to hold on to</i>

46:29.466 --> 46:31.766
<i>who I've always been
just a little longer.</i>

46:32.202 --> 46:34.170
<i>And then, when I go to college
in Los Angeles,</i>

46:34.304 --> 46:36.071
<i>I'll be gay and proud,
I promise.</i>

<i>Love, Jacques.</i>

47:44.675 --> 47:46.109
Shit!

47:50.514 --> 47:52.280
So, yeah,
after swimming with dolphins,

47:52.349 --> 47:54.450
we fly to Saint Martin
for New Year's.

47:55.151 --> 47:57.153
Anybody else,
Christmas in the Caribbean?

47:57.787 --> 47:58.487
Staying here.

47:58.589 --> 48:00.488
We have a classic
Spier tradition

48:00.556 --> 48:02.356
of French toast
on Christmas Eve.

48:02.559 --> 48:04.360
I'm going to an unheated
vacation house

48:04.429 --> 48:05.361
in the middle of nowhere.

48:05.596 --> 48:07.797
As is our bleak
family tradition.

48:08.165 --> 48:10.799
Ow! Ow!

48:12.001 --> 48:12.900
Oh, man. Oh.

48:12.970 --> 48:13.870
You okay?

48:13.938 --> 48:15.438
Oh, yeah, that's a paper cut.

48:16.140 --> 48:17.140
Overdramatic.

48:17.641 --> 48:21.042
Um, Simon, do you know
where the bandages are?

48:21.510 --> 48:23.911
Yeah. They're just
in the supply closet.

48:24.314 --> 48:25.514
Okay, do you mind showing me?

48:28.719 --> 48:29.618
Be right back.

48:30.821 --> 48:32.288
He's like a nurse, this man.

48:33.758 --> 48:35.558
Okay, I don't actually have
a paper cut.

48:35.659 --> 48:37.760
I know that, Martin.
You're a very bad actor.

48:37.828 --> 48:39.595
What, you think this is funny?

48:41.231 --> 48:43.332
Simon, look,
I don't wanna have to

48:43.399 --> 48:45.232
leak your emails, all right?
But I will.

48:45.400 --> 48:48.169
Look, you cannot
bring Blue into this, okay?

48:48.237 --> 48:49.471
If he found out
that my emails got leaked,

48:49.541 --> 48:51.274
he'd get totally freaked,
all right?

48:51.341 --> 48:52.241
He'd never talk to me again.

48:52.310 --> 48:53.877
Yeah, probably not, you know?

48:54.143 --> 48:55.943
The Internet's a freaky place
to meet people.

48:56.046 --> 48:57.514
- Yo.
- Hey!

48:57.581 --> 48:58.280
Hey!

48:58.449 --> 48:59.714
- Fun movie! Freak.
- <i>Freaky Friday.</i>

48:59.783 --> 49:01.784
- That's a fun movie!
- Freaky, freak, freaky.

49:01.850 --> 49:04.285
- Yeah, freaky-deaky Dutch!
- <i>♪ She's a super freak ♪</i>

49:04.420 --> 49:05.787
- <i>♪ Super freak ♪</i>
- You guys are weird.

49:06.389 --> 49:08.857
I need a Band-Aid.
Those programs are a bitch.

49:10.859 --> 49:13.360
Erm, yo. Martin was having
trouble running his lines

49:13.429 --> 49:14.829
and we were thinking
we could go

49:14.899 --> 49:17.401
to Waffle House
and go over 'em.

49:18.570 --> 49:19.336
- Really?
- Yeah.

49:19.403 --> 49:20.502
That would be great.

49:21.036 --> 49:22.270
I'm insky.

49:24.342 --> 49:26.743
- Good work, Spier.
- Go to hell, Martin.

49:35.819 --> 49:37.987
<i>Jacques,
if I were a betting man,</i>

49:38.122 --> 49:39.388
<i>I'd say you were
drunk emailing me</i>

49:39.455 --> 49:40.387
<i>during that last letter.</i>

49:40.557 --> 49:42.291
<i>Don't worry. I liked it.</i>

49:42.693 --> 49:44.494
<i>As for coming out,
I know what you mean</i>

49:44.560 --> 49:45.861
<i>about wanting to wait
till college.</i>

49:46.029 --> 49:47.697
<i>But our emails
have inspired me.</i>

49:48.265 --> 49:50.832
<i>I'm going to tell my family.
So thanks, Jacques.</i>

49:51.336 --> 49:53.237
<i>Love, Blue.</i>

50:07.918 --> 50:08.819
Yeah.

50:11.287 --> 50:12.387
Hey!

50:12.789 --> 50:15.224
- Madame.
- Oh.

50:16.994 --> 50:18.528
Simon...

50:19.562 --> 50:21.563
How the thespians
rehearse, right?

50:21.631 --> 50:22.664
Hey, guys.

50:23.232 --> 50:24.165
What can I get you?

50:24.499 --> 50:27.135
Lyle! You guys know Lyle?
We have Latin together.

50:27.304 --> 50:28.570
I don't think so.

50:28.905 --> 50:29.771
Hi. How's it going?

50:29.837 --> 50:32.540
Actually, we had Bio together
last year?

50:32.674 --> 50:34.075
- Oh, really?
- It's Simon, right?

50:34.411 --> 50:37.246
Yeah. Yeah, sorry,
I don't, um...

50:37.314 --> 50:39.115
It's okay.
It was like a big class,

50:39.182 --> 50:40.649
and I have a good memory
for faces.

50:42.018 --> 50:43.217
What can I get you guys?

50:43.353 --> 50:45.387
Well, we plan
on being here for a while.

50:45.622 --> 50:48.324
So, we're gonna start off small
and go larger.

50:48.858 --> 50:52.192
Probably get some bacon first,
some sausage. I'd say...

50:52.962 --> 50:56.031
<i>"You're right. I'm much
too strange and extraordinary.</i>

50:56.298 --> 50:58.899
Much! And much too distracting!"

50:59.236 --> 51:00.134
Wow.

51:00.904 --> 51:02.771
And you never did any acting
at your old school?

51:03.907 --> 51:05.673
No. Can we get back to...

51:05.740 --> 51:07.407
And yet,
you're from D.C., right?

51:07.477 --> 51:08.978
Yeah. Can you give me
my next cue, though?

51:09.046 --> 51:10.778
So why
did you move here?

51:11.514 --> 51:13.282
Because my parents got divorced

51:13.351 --> 51:15.183
and my aunt found us
an apartment in her building.

51:15.350 --> 51:16.384
Why'd they get divorced?

51:16.685 --> 51:17.585
Why does it matter, Martin?

51:17.720 --> 51:18.955
Are you writing a book
about girls

51:19.022 --> 51:20.322
from a broken home in D.C.?

51:21.891 --> 51:22.791
So?

51:24.293 --> 51:26.060
I thought that my dad

51:26.129 --> 51:28.997
was the greatest person
on the planet.

51:30.467 --> 51:34.302
But it turns out that he's
just a sad, tired loser

51:34.370 --> 51:36.871
who hates his job,
drinks way too much beer,

51:37.072 --> 51:38.206
and cheats on his wife.

51:38.607 --> 51:41.141
To make up for all the stuff
that I just mentioned, so...

51:41.311 --> 51:42.778
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

51:43.579 --> 51:44.279
Yeah.

51:44.646 --> 51:46.514
You deserve the father
that you thought you had.

51:49.186 --> 51:50.720
You know what, Abby?

51:52.388 --> 51:54.222
You deserve
a goddamn superhero.

51:54.925 --> 51:57.526
Okay, thank you.
Let's get back to the...

51:57.759 --> 51:58.660
Say it.

52:00.095 --> 52:00.995
What?

52:01.799 --> 52:02.965
I wanna hear you say

52:03.401 --> 52:07.068
"I, Abby Susso,
am an incredible young woman

52:07.737 --> 52:10.438
and deserve
a goddamn superhero."

52:10.772 --> 52:12.841
I'm not gonna say that, Martin.

52:13.843 --> 52:15.177
Okay. Well, um...

52:15.746 --> 52:17.546
I won't stop until you say it.

52:18.280 --> 52:19.380
Okay.

52:20.415 --> 52:21.949
- What are you...
- Excuse me.

52:22.051 --> 52:23.886
- Waffle House patrons!
- Martin. Martin, stop.

52:23.953 --> 52:25.285
- Pardon the interruption.
- Martin.

52:25.354 --> 52:27.923
I would just like to say
that Abby Susso here

52:28.158 --> 52:29.357
is an incredible young woman.

52:29.426 --> 52:30.491
Martin, please.

52:30.560 --> 52:32.628
And deserves
a goddamn superhero.

52:32.728 --> 52:35.095
- Okay, okay...
- That's right. Abby Susso!

52:35.531 --> 52:37.133
Abby Susso is an incredible
young woman!

52:37.198 --> 52:38.198
I'm Abby Susso!

52:38.769 --> 52:41.035
Incredible young woman,
and deserves...

52:41.503 --> 52:42.837
- A goddamn superhero.
- A goddamn superhero.

52:42.971 --> 52:44.905
- A goddamn superhero!
- A goddamn superhero!

52:45.207 --> 52:46.675
A goddamn superhero!

52:53.215 --> 52:54.116
Yeah.

52:55.051 --> 52:56.384
All right.

52:57.120 --> 52:58.719
Breakthrough. Yeah.

52:59.555 --> 53:02.057
Okay, you can all go back
to your meals. Thank you.

53:02.124 --> 53:03.726
Please sit down. Please.

53:07.263 --> 53:08.164
Well...

53:08.732 --> 53:11.466
Well, let's get back to...

53:12.035 --> 53:14.036
- my entrance into your song.
- I'm gonna take five.

53:15.038 --> 53:17.173
"Ah, the Kit Kat Klub
proudly presents...

53:17.375 --> 53:18.275
I'll be right back.

53:18.674 --> 53:19.673
...a beautiful woman
coming straight from England."

53:19.675 --> 53:21.977
<i>Sally Bowles, everybody."</i>

53:33.256 --> 53:34.156
Hey.

53:35.757 --> 53:38.792
Were you in Bio when they did
that identifying leaves test?

53:39.028 --> 53:41.529
Yes. And Joel Winslow
ate that poison ivy.

53:41.832 --> 53:43.431
Because Doug Fogerty told him
it was pot.

53:43.634 --> 53:45.201
- Right.
- Poor Joel.

53:45.767 --> 53:47.568
I think he just wants
to be liked 'cause...

53:48.338 --> 53:51.371
you ever notice that he has
extra pens in his backpack?

53:51.440 --> 53:54.341
Like, you know,
he's just waiting for the day

53:54.410 --> 53:56.311
that someone comes up
to ask him for a pen?

53:56.847 --> 54:00.114
And then he can be that guy
to give 'em a pen.

54:01.384 --> 54:02.819
You see everything,
don't you, Simon?

54:03.219 --> 54:04.485
I don't know.

54:05.354 --> 54:06.855
But Simon means
"the one who hears"

54:06.957 --> 54:09.225
and Spier means
"the one who sees"

54:09.291 --> 54:11.460
so you put that all together

54:11.527 --> 54:14.494
and pretty sure that means
I was just destined

54:14.562 --> 54:15.963
to be up
in everybody's business.

54:18.734 --> 54:19.733
I've gotta get back inside

54:19.802 --> 54:21.603
and scrub down
some waffle irons.

54:22.137 --> 54:24.039
- Duty calls.
- Indeed.

54:25.174 --> 54:26.174
I'll see you in there.

54:26.975 --> 54:27.876
Yeah, I'll see ya.

54:43.927 --> 54:44.826
Hi.

54:45.596 --> 54:48.264
<i>So my dad's flying in
tonight for Hanukkah.</i>

54:48.598 --> 54:49.564
<i>If you are thinking,</i>

54:49.798 --> 54:51.099
<i>"But Hanukkah isn't
for another month!"</i>

54:51.166 --> 54:52.533
<i>Well, you are correct.</i>

54:52.903 --> 54:55.103
<i>Welcome to navigating
divorced parents.</i>

54:55.804 --> 54:57.138
<i>Take holidays
where you can get them.</i>

54:57.340 --> 55:00.442
<i>And my dad's staying at the
same crappy motel as always.</i>

55:00.510 --> 55:02.710
<i>We'll do all our
horribly awkward traditions.</i>

55:03.613 --> 55:05.947
<i>We'll light the menorah
and I'll silently pray</i>

55:06.016 --> 55:07.884
<i>that the sprinklers
don't go off.</i>

55:08.184 --> 55:09.718
<i>That's happened twice before.</i>

55:11.187 --> 55:13.555
Would you believe I'm
considering doubling down

55:13.723 --> 55:15.023
and turning
this whole awkward mess

55:15.090 --> 55:16.791
into a coming out thing?

55:17.760 --> 55:19.027
<i>Do you think I'm crazy?</i>

55:19.995 --> 55:21.730
<i>No, Blue,
I don't think you're crazy.</i>

55:22.165 --> 55:24.033
<i>I think you're crazy brave.</i>

55:38.282 --> 55:40.949
Honestly, Martin used to
annoy the crap out of me.

55:41.016 --> 55:43.285
But he's actually kind of
a cool person.

55:45.689 --> 55:47.656
I've been meaning to ask you
about your parents.

55:48.356 --> 55:49.590
I just didn't wanna say anything

55:49.657 --> 55:50.757
when we were actually
in the restaurant.

55:50.826 --> 55:52.693
I wasn't sure if you
wanted to talk about it.

55:53.061 --> 55:55.328
Yeah. No, I don't mention it
a lot

55:55.665 --> 55:58.100
because it kind of messes
with my image.

55:59.102 --> 56:00.235
What kind of image?

56:02.103 --> 56:04.071
The girl who is excited

56:04.140 --> 56:06.275
to start a new school
senior year.

56:06.841 --> 56:09.342
Girl whose life didn't
just end,

56:09.411 --> 56:10.512
like, three months ago,

56:10.579 --> 56:12.981
who's angry and sad
all the time.

56:15.585 --> 56:17.053
Girl who still believes in love.

56:17.953 --> 56:20.921
Come on.
You still believe in love.

56:22.057 --> 56:22.957
Maybe.

56:23.559 --> 56:24.926
Have you ever been in love?

56:28.697 --> 56:29.798
I think so.

56:44.478 --> 56:45.379
Abby.

56:46.583 --> 56:47.682
Yeah?

56:51.087 --> 56:51.988
I'm gay.

56:53.957 --> 56:54.856
Oh.

56:57.659 --> 56:59.093
You can't tell anyone though.

57:00.297 --> 57:01.129
Nobody really knows,

57:01.263 --> 57:03.297
and I don't really want people
to find out.

57:03.366 --> 57:04.899
I won't. I promise.

57:05.235 --> 57:06.135
Okay.

57:11.473 --> 57:12.373
You surprised?

57:14.045 --> 57:14.944
No.

57:16.312 --> 57:17.947
- So you knew?
- No.

57:19.449 --> 57:20.715
But you're not surprised?

57:21.750 --> 57:23.150
Do you want me
to be surprised?

57:24.720 --> 57:25.819
I don't know.

57:27.156 --> 57:28.057
Okay.

57:28.857 --> 57:30.025
Well, I love you.

57:31.492 --> 57:32.393
So...

57:41.706 --> 57:42.806
Love you, too.

57:50.813 --> 57:54.181
There's no one behind us.

57:54.250 --> 57:55.516
You don't have to put
your blinker on.

57:55.585 --> 57:56.952
- Okay, just being safe.
- Yeah.

58:10.999 --> 58:13.868
<i>Dear Blue, I hope
it goes okay with your dad.</i>

58:14.168 --> 58:16.670
<i>Whatever happens,
you inspired me.</i>

58:17.038 --> 58:18.839
<i>I came out
to my friend tonight.</i>

58:18.942 --> 58:20.841
<i>And I never would have
done that without you.</i>

58:20.977 --> 58:22.877
<i>Maybe we should ride
this bravery train</i>

58:22.979 --> 58:24.479
<i>and reveal our identities.</i>

58:24.981 --> 58:27.483
<i>I'm dying to know who you are.
Love, Jacques.</i>

58:38.394 --> 58:40.361
<i>I told my dad.</i>

58:41.230 --> 58:44.932
<i>It was insanely awkward.
But also, kind of fine.</i>

58:45.834 --> 58:47.468
<i>And you got it backwards.</i>

58:47.936 --> 58:49.803
<i>It's you who inspires me.</i>

58:51.641 --> 58:52.840
<i>But I'm sorry,</i>

58:53.442 --> 58:56.109
<i>I'm just not ready for us to
know each other's identities.</i>

58:56.278 --> 58:57.412
<i>Love, Blue.</i>

59:01.918 --> 59:04.585
- Hey! What are you doing?
- I'm a fry shark!

59:04.785 --> 59:06.287
Yeah!

59:08.323 --> 59:10.357
- That is good.
- You're a good fry shark.

59:10.425 --> 59:11.826
- Thank you, thank you.
- I like that.

59:11.893 --> 59:13.093
I didn't even know
you were coming near.

59:13.161 --> 59:14.060
You know
what day it is?

59:14.361 --> 59:15.762
- What day is it?
- Must be Friday!

59:15.830 --> 59:16.730
Oh!

59:17.167 --> 59:18.834
I guess I'm being loved,
right? Right?

59:19.034 --> 59:19.733
Yeah.

59:20.369 --> 59:22.304
Hey, what do you get
when you get black and Jewish?

59:22.438 --> 59:23.338
- What?
- Bluish.

59:23.905 --> 59:25.006
That's mean.

59:25.073 --> 59:25.772
Simon?

59:26.140 --> 59:28.776
Since when does Abby find
Martin so goddamn funny?

59:29.543 --> 59:30.511
Yeah, it's crazy.

59:30.847 --> 59:32.080
You know,
this is stupid.

59:32.213 --> 59:33.880
I'm just gonna tell her
that I like her.

59:33.947 --> 59:34.848
And I've been thinking

59:34.949 --> 59:35.982
the whole
sexual experience thing,

59:36.049 --> 59:37.185
it's not that big of a deal.

59:37.286 --> 59:38.687
And, actually,
I've been practicing, right?

59:38.754 --> 59:39.787
I got this thing online.

59:39.990 --> 59:40.955
It's really cool.
It's called a pocket puss...

59:41.024 --> 59:42.124
Abby likes Martin.

59:43.325 --> 59:44.324
She told me herself.

59:44.759 --> 59:46.927
- But he's Martin.
- I know.

59:48.598 --> 59:49.497
Look, I don't care.

59:49.598 --> 59:50.865
- I'm gonna try.
- Hey, wait, wait.

59:50.932 --> 59:52.199
What about Leah?

59:52.935 --> 59:54.168
What about Leah?

59:54.871 --> 59:55.971
Dude.

59:58.141 --> 01:00:00.274
- Leah's in love with you.
- No, she's not.

01:00:00.575 --> 01:00:01.509
Are you kidding me?

01:00:01.643 --> 01:00:03.109
I mean, come on.
The way she looks at you

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:05.814
and how she's been all jealous
ever since Abby's been around?

01:00:05.882 --> 01:00:08.550
And she blushes every time
you come into the room.

01:00:10.085 --> 01:00:11.586
Look, you and Abby...

01:00:12.690 --> 01:00:13.923
it's never gonna happen.

01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:15.756
But you and Leah...

01:00:16.459 --> 01:00:18.327
I mean, you could be
incredible together.

01:00:29.170 --> 01:00:30.337
- Hey.
- What's up?

01:00:32.308 --> 01:00:34.108
So I have something
to tell you.

01:00:36.011 --> 01:00:37.513
Nick just asked me
to get dinner

01:00:37.579 --> 01:00:38.580
before the homecoming game.

01:00:40.215 --> 01:00:41.116
Okay.

01:00:41.782 --> 01:00:43.950
No, like, Si, he was like...

01:00:44.185 --> 01:00:45.352
He came up to me
and he's like,

01:00:45.687 --> 01:00:46.688
"Do you wanna go get dinner?"

01:00:46.921 --> 01:00:47.821
All right, and I was like,

01:00:48.124 --> 01:00:49.423
"Sure, are Abby and Simon in?"
And he was like

01:00:49.691 --> 01:00:52.961
"I was thinking it could just be
the two of us. Like, a date."

01:00:53.995 --> 01:00:55.095
That's amazing.

01:00:56.431 --> 01:00:57.332
It is?

01:00:58.835 --> 01:00:59.934
Yeah.

01:01:00.769 --> 01:01:02.035
Leah, come on.

01:01:05.107 --> 01:01:06.341
I know you're into him.

01:01:06.542 --> 01:01:07.442
What?

01:01:08.011 --> 01:01:09.209
All that stuff
that you were talking

01:01:09.276 --> 01:01:10.811
about the night
after Bram's party,

01:01:10.878 --> 01:01:13.613
about, you know,
being so into one person

01:01:13.682 --> 01:01:15.014
that it almost kills you.

01:01:16.685 --> 01:01:17.986
You were talking about Nick.

01:01:20.488 --> 01:01:21.388
Uh...

01:01:22.156 --> 01:01:24.291
So you think
I should go out with him?

01:01:25.295 --> 01:01:27.029
Yes. Yes.

01:01:29.231 --> 01:01:30.131
Okay.

01:01:31.598 --> 01:01:32.299
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

01:01:32.702 --> 01:01:34.101
I promise you,
you're not gonna regret it.

01:01:34.168 --> 01:01:35.269
It's gonna be great!

01:01:38.906 --> 01:01:41.675
Let's pull out
your claws, Grizzlies!

01:01:42.279 --> 01:01:45.546
Oh!

01:01:50.085 --> 01:01:53.387
Simon, that Almont QB
is insanely hot.

01:01:53.921 --> 01:01:55.722
We can talk about stuff
like this now, you know.

01:01:55.789 --> 01:01:57.256
Yeah, I still don't know

01:01:57.325 --> 01:01:58.693
if I really quite
figured out how.

01:02:00.663 --> 01:02:02.798
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

01:02:02.864 --> 01:02:05.798
We gotta practice.
All right. Simon.

01:02:06.033 --> 01:02:07.033
- Yeah?
- Do you think

01:02:07.336 --> 01:02:12.105
that quarterback is lookin'
fine in those hot pants?

01:02:13.543 --> 01:02:14.609
He's lookin' pretty fine.

01:02:16.812 --> 01:02:18.980
No. No. No.

01:02:19.414 --> 01:02:23.051
Fine! Good.
Put your body into it.

01:02:23.519 --> 01:02:24.817
Fine!

01:02:25.187 --> 01:02:26.121
That was really good.

01:02:26.187 --> 01:02:27.288
- That was so good.
- Thanks.

01:02:27.656 --> 01:02:29.623
Hey, check it out.
It's the Waffle House guy.

01:02:31.693 --> 01:02:32.592
Oh, yeah.

01:02:33.595 --> 01:02:34.495
Whoa.

01:02:35.763 --> 01:02:38.131
- Lyle?
- I don't know. Could be.

01:02:38.201 --> 01:02:39.967
- I don't know.
- Do you think he's...

01:02:40.035 --> 01:02:41.235
I don't know.

01:02:42.204 --> 01:02:43.537
Okay, well,
you should talk to him.

01:02:43.606 --> 01:02:44.605
I'm gonna go get a coffee.

01:02:44.672 --> 01:02:46.239
Look, you are fine!

01:02:46.574 --> 01:02:47.576
You got this.

01:02:48.478 --> 01:02:49.377
Hi.

01:02:50.945 --> 01:02:53.380
Hey. If it isn't
my favorite waiter.

01:02:53.582 --> 01:02:56.616
Ah, there he is.
The guy who sees everything.

01:02:56.886 --> 01:02:57.853
Yeah.

01:02:58.286 --> 01:03:00.086
Hey, I wouldn't have taken you
for a homecoming guy.

01:03:00.187 --> 01:03:01.454
Oh, just here for the coffee.

01:03:01.790 --> 01:03:04.123
Of course. Yeah, it's all
about the cappuccinos

01:03:04.192 --> 01:03:05.693
and camaraderie for this guy.

01:03:11.866 --> 01:03:12.767
I'm glad you're here.

01:03:13.969 --> 01:03:15.068
You are?

01:03:15.737 --> 01:03:16.637
Yeah.

01:03:17.438 --> 01:03:19.338
'Cause I wanted to
ask you something.

01:03:21.042 --> 01:03:22.176
I was gonna ask you
the other day

01:03:22.245 --> 01:03:24.711
and then I was, like,
too chickenshit.

01:03:27.014 --> 01:03:28.248
What's Abby's deal?

01:03:30.351 --> 01:03:31.884
I know you and her
hang out a lot.

01:03:31.953 --> 01:03:33.787
Are the two of you
like a thing, or...

01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:35.689
No.

01:03:36.224 --> 01:03:38.124
No, uh, we're just friends.

01:03:38.461 --> 01:03:40.228
I could never be just friends
with someone that hot.

01:03:40.295 --> 01:03:40.994
Yeah!

01:03:41.161 --> 01:03:42.397
Every day is a struggle.

01:03:44.196 --> 01:03:46.733
I gotta go. I'll see ya.

01:03:50.737 --> 01:03:52.472
Hey! You!

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:55.740
Little birdie told me
you're into bears!

01:03:59.148 --> 01:04:00.515
Dude! It's me!

01:04:02.617 --> 01:04:04.217
I'm the Creekwood bear.

01:04:04.988 --> 01:04:05.986
Of course, you are.

01:04:06.055 --> 01:04:07.154
Thank you.

01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:08.390
Not a compliment.

01:04:08.591 --> 01:04:10.757
Hey, um... I figured out
my next move with Abby.

01:04:11.124 --> 01:04:12.626
Great, that's good for you,
Martin.

01:04:13.362 --> 01:04:15.462
I just wanted to run it by you
real quick.

01:04:15.631 --> 01:04:16.964
No, Martin, look.

01:04:17.466 --> 01:04:18.565
I've been helping you for weeks

01:04:18.634 --> 01:04:20.133
and I am sick and tired
of helping you

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:21.167
mess with my friends' lives.

01:04:21.236 --> 01:04:22.302
So why don't you
just do that shit

01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:23.670
that you did at Waffle House?

01:04:24.139 --> 01:04:25.038
That went great.

01:04:25.572 --> 01:04:27.107
So you're saying
I should go for it?

01:04:27.375 --> 01:04:28.408
It's kind of a big gesture.

01:04:28.476 --> 01:04:30.845
Go big or go home!
Right, Martin?

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:32.847
Go big or go home.

01:04:33.082 --> 01:04:35.450
I like that.
Thanks for the pep talk, man!

01:04:36.250 --> 01:04:37.417
Gotta get amped up.

01:04:38.119 --> 01:04:39.886
Come on!

01:04:46.193 --> 01:04:47.360
We're gonna take ya!

01:04:56.572 --> 01:04:57.470
Ethan!

01:04:58.173 --> 01:04:59.707
I didn't know
you like football.

01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:01.875
He's just here
to check out the packages.

01:05:01.942 --> 01:05:03.075
Didn't your mother
ever tell you

01:05:03.143 --> 01:05:05.278
not to grab your micropenis
in public?

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:08.015
Could we get some hummus
for that baby carrot?

01:05:08.217 --> 01:05:09.616
Shut up, man.

01:05:14.289 --> 01:05:16.457
- Hey, guys.
- What's up? Hey.

01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:21.695
- How was dinner?
- It was good.

01:05:22.297 --> 01:05:24.629
Yeah, uh, we got
soup dumplings.

01:05:25.265 --> 01:05:27.367
That dumpling place
I told you about?

01:05:28.104 --> 01:05:29.003
Yeah.

01:05:29.235 --> 01:05:31.137
You know, maybe you could go
with Martin.

01:05:32.942 --> 01:05:34.208
Why would I go with Martin?

01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:38.145
<i>Please stand

01:05:42.182 --> 01:05:44.283
This goes out

01:05:45.053 --> 01:05:47.255
And my vocal coach,
Monica Lewis.

01:05:47.756 --> 01:05:48.655
Yeah!

What the hell are you doing?

01:06:06.507 --> 01:06:07.340
Sorry. Hi.

01:06:07.744 --> 01:06:09.676
Hi, everyone.
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

01:06:09.743 --> 01:06:11.444
Why are we interrupting
the national anthem?

01:06:11.513 --> 01:06:12.946
But I have something to say...

01:06:13.581 --> 01:06:15.916
that's a little more important
than the national anthem.

01:06:16.918 --> 01:06:18.286
No offense, America.

01:06:20.287 --> 01:06:23.223
Abigail Katherine Susso...

01:06:23.757 --> 01:06:26.058
when you transferred
to Creekwood High School,

01:06:26.494 --> 01:06:28.696
just a short three
and a half months ago,

01:06:29.830 --> 01:06:32.131
you not only transferred
into a new school,

01:06:32.533 --> 01:06:35.534
you transferred your way
into a new heart

01:06:36.204 --> 01:06:38.938
belonging to me.
My heart. Right here.

01:06:39.574 --> 01:06:42.609
And whether it was being
your partner in pong,

01:06:43.045 --> 01:06:44.712
or your Waffle House warrior,

01:06:45.747 --> 01:06:46.914
I have cherished...

01:06:47.381 --> 01:06:52.551
the 135,300 minutes
that we've spent together.

01:06:53.121 --> 01:06:54.287
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:58.958
135,301 minutes.

01:06:59.393 --> 01:07:02.395
And I know that you're
this smart, talented

01:07:03.232 --> 01:07:04.598
perfect creature.

01:07:05.466 --> 01:07:10.835
And, uh, I'm just a sweaty
schlub in a bear costume.

01:07:11.572 --> 01:07:13.442
But like old Bogie used to say,

01:07:14.341 --> 01:07:15.842
it's a "crazy mixed-up world."

01:07:17.145 --> 01:07:18.247
So, Abby,

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:19.947
without further ado...

01:07:22.217 --> 01:07:23.451
will you go out with me?

01:07:24.886 --> 01:07:26.987
She's too hot for you, assface!

01:07:28.089 --> 01:07:30.357
Excuse me. Sorry.

01:07:33.327 --> 01:07:34.993
Just say yes. Say yes.

01:07:35.163 --> 01:07:36.264
Martin...

01:07:37.232 --> 01:07:38.999
I am so sorry.

01:07:40.066 --> 01:07:41.869
I don't feel that way about you.

01:07:43.871 --> 01:07:44.839
You don't?

01:07:46.775 --> 01:07:47.675
No.

01:07:48.177 --> 01:07:49.643
But I really like
hanging out with you

01:07:49.711 --> 01:07:53.913
and I don't know, maybe we could
still be friends, you know?

01:07:54.382 --> 01:07:55.549
Yeah, uh...

01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:58.619
Are those doves?

01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:05.659
No, no, hey, hey! Suraj!

01:08:05.827 --> 01:08:08.428
Hey! No, no!
She said no! No, don't.

01:08:16.671 --> 01:08:18.339
Yo, I thought you said
she liked him.

01:08:18.871 --> 01:08:23.276
Not the ceremonious
dove launch I was hoping for.

01:08:23.578 --> 01:08:26.613
But still uplifting to free
some birds.

01:08:27.015 --> 01:08:27.913
Yeah.

01:08:28.747 --> 01:08:29.648
Okay, uh...

01:08:31.086 --> 01:08:32.053
Enjoy the game.

01:08:34.188 --> 01:08:36.221
Nice try, Martin!
And way to go, Martin!

01:08:36.291 --> 01:08:38.424
You gave it a shot! Right?

01:08:49.537 --> 01:08:50.738
That was terrible.

01:08:51.604 --> 01:08:53.906
Don't worry, people will get
over it in a few weeks.

01:09:14.694 --> 01:09:15.929
<i>This is Donald J. Trump.</i>

01:09:16.032 --> 01:09:18.232
<i>Martin Addison can't come
to the phone right now.</i>

01:09:18.299 --> 01:09:20.832
Hey, Martin, it's Simon. Again.

01:09:21.001 --> 01:09:24.404
Um, look, I wanna make sure
you're doing all right.

01:09:24.471 --> 01:09:26.206
I know it's been tough
since, uh...

01:09:27.108 --> 01:09:30.142
Well, you know since when.
Um, listen. Just...

01:09:31.278 --> 01:09:32.377
Just give me
a call back, okay?

01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:33.979
I just wanna
make sure you're okay.

01:09:36.251 --> 01:09:39.051
Hey! What you doin' in there?

01:09:39.219 --> 01:09:40.118
Really?

01:09:40.687 --> 01:09:42.421
I need you to help me decorate.
Untangle these for me, will ya?

01:09:42.425 --> 01:09:43.724
This is not cool. I'll be down
in a minute, okay?

01:09:43.825 --> 01:09:45.725
- What's not cool?
- I'll be down in a minute.

01:09:45.794 --> 01:09:48.028
The fact that you're on
a ladder next to my room!

01:09:48.095 --> 01:09:49.328
I can still clearly see you.

01:09:49.828 --> 01:09:53.865
All right, there you go.
Okay. Merry Christmas.

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:00.539

01:10:14.055 --> 01:10:15.289
Oh, shit.

<i>Ladies need not apply.</i>

01:12:14.141 --> 01:12:16.175
<i>We should all probably be

01:12:16.243 --> 01:12:18.477
<i>instead of Martin Addison's

01:12:18.879 --> 01:12:20.647
<i>which was actually
kind of sweet,</i>

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.881

<i>Sincerely, Anonymous.</i>

01:12:31.726 --> 01:12:34.194
<i>Si, have you read it?</i>

01:12:34.528 --> 01:12:35.594
I can't talk right now.

01:12:35.762 --> 01:12:37.297
- <i>No. Si, wait!</i>
- I gotta go.

01:12:38.365 --> 01:12:39.264
Si?

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:40.700
I saw it.

01:12:41.368 --> 01:12:44.169
I already reported it.
They're gonna take it down.

01:12:44.371 --> 01:12:45.605
It's too late.
No, there's people

01:12:45.673 --> 01:12:47.040
who've already seen it, so...

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:48.339
it doesn't really matter.

01:12:50.512 --> 01:12:51.613
It's true.

01:12:54.881 --> 01:12:55.782
I'm gay.

01:12:56.515 --> 01:12:57.616
Oh...

01:12:58.185 --> 01:12:59.586
So what are you gonna do?

01:13:00.654 --> 01:13:01.755
I don't know.

01:13:02.255 --> 01:13:03.221
You could deny it.

01:13:04.025 --> 01:13:05.759
Why the hell
would I deny it, Nora?

01:13:05.826 --> 01:13:07.327
I'm not ashamed of it.

01:13:07.562 --> 01:13:09.829
You've just never really
said anything.

01:13:09.963 --> 01:13:10.663
So what?

01:13:10.897 --> 01:13:11.964
What does that have to do
with anything?

01:13:12.033 --> 01:13:13.465
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:13:13.533 --> 01:13:14.834
Sorry.

01:13:20.939 --> 01:13:22.040
<i>I know you're going
off the grid</i>

01:13:22.109 --> 01:13:23.575
<i>and you won't see this
until you're back,</i>

01:13:23.643 --> 01:13:24.643
<i>but something's happened.</i>

01:13:25.179 --> 01:13:26.880
<i>You're gonna find out
who I am.</i>

01:13:27.314 --> 01:13:28.815
<i>And someone posted our emails.</i>

01:13:28.982 --> 01:13:31.617
<i>Please don't freak out.
Please, Blue.</i>

01:13:31.953 --> 01:13:34.119
<i>I need you to promise me
you won't disappear.</i>

01:14:09.924 --> 01:14:11.090
Mum,
let me open my present.

01:14:11.457 --> 01:14:14.092
Honey, I'm trying to
tell you you need to shave.

01:14:14.928 --> 01:14:16.328
Does that mean
you're gonna keep cooking?

01:14:16.397 --> 01:14:18.464
Yeah, of course. I can
make dinner tonight, too.

01:14:18.531 --> 01:14:19.463
- Awesome.
- What's this for?

01:14:19.531 --> 01:14:20.432
Oh!

01:14:20.868 --> 01:14:22.803
This one, Sherlock.
There you go.

01:14:28.207 --> 01:14:29.207
What is it?

01:14:30.611 --> 01:14:31.912
Bluetooth headphones.

01:14:31.979 --> 01:14:33.646
- Do you like the black?
- Oh, I love it.

01:14:33.981 --> 01:14:35.280
Because I didn't
know if you liked...

01:14:35.349 --> 01:14:36.049
This is great.

01:14:36.351 --> 01:14:37.451
- They have other colors.
- He said he likes it.

01:14:37.818 --> 01:14:39.016
- No, I love it.
- Okay. I have the receipt.

01:14:39.018 --> 01:14:39.886
He's good.

01:14:46.394 --> 01:14:49.796
Actually, I did want to talk
to you guys about something.

01:14:51.096 --> 01:14:51.997
What is it?

01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:55.201
Uh, well...

01:14:55.301 --> 01:14:56.202
Let me guess...

01:14:57.972 --> 01:14:59.237
you got somebody pregnant.

01:15:00.606 --> 01:15:01.506
No, you're pregnant.

01:15:01.977 --> 01:15:04.544
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm pregnant.
I knew it.

01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:05.644
He's got that glow about him,
baby.

01:15:05.713 --> 01:15:06.612
Honey.

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:07.815
No. Uh...

01:15:14.054 --> 01:15:14.953
I'm gay.

01:15:17.258 --> 01:15:18.156
Honey.

01:15:21.062 --> 01:15:23.296
And I don't want you guys to
think anything different.

01:15:24.263 --> 01:15:25.163
I'm still me.

01:15:25.231 --> 01:15:26.231
Of course you are.

01:15:26.299 --> 01:15:27.801
- Oh, Simon.
- Yeah.

01:15:28.703 --> 01:15:29.602
So you're gay?

01:15:30.471 --> 01:15:32.172
Which one of your
old girlfriends turned ya?

01:15:32.239 --> 01:15:34.038
Was it the one
with the big eyebrow...

01:15:34.108 --> 01:15:35.175
- Jack.
- Jesus Christ.

01:15:35.242 --> 01:15:36.742
Dad, can you ever
shut the hell up?

01:15:36.810 --> 01:15:37.710
I'm kidding.

01:15:37.845 --> 01:15:39.011
- It's not funny.
- I'm kidding, Nora.

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:41.014
Just open up your gift. Please.

01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:47.521
It's okay, honey.

01:15:47.589 --> 01:15:48.855
- Nora, I got you this.
- Simon.

01:15:48.922 --> 01:15:50.322
That's for you.
No, that's for you.

01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:51.289
That's from me.

01:15:56.764 --> 01:15:57.898
It's a Cuisinart.

01:15:59.064 --> 01:16:00.933
I love it. Thank you, Simon.

01:16:04.737 --> 01:16:07.406
<i>Dear Blue,
happy New Year.</i>

01:16:07.608 --> 01:16:08.775
<i>I haven't heard from you,</i>

01:16:09.008 --> 01:16:11.344
<i>so I'm going to assume it's
because you have no service.</i>

01:16:11.945 --> 01:16:14.212
<i>I came out to my entire family
on Christmas.</i>

01:16:14.715 --> 01:16:15.649
<i>It didn't go great.</i>

01:16:15.983 --> 01:16:17.115
<i>And I've been avoiding
my friends</i>

01:16:17.182 --> 01:16:20.085
<i>the whole break
for all sorts of reasons.</i>

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:22.054
<i>Change is exhausting.</i>

01:16:22.422 --> 01:16:23.789
<i>I feel like
there's nowhere to hide</i>

01:16:23.857 --> 01:16:25.890
<i>from all the newness
of everything.</i>

01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:27.561
<i>Except here. With you.</i>

01:16:28.328 --> 01:16:29.262
<i>Please write to me.</i>

01:16:29.797 --> 01:16:32.098
<i>As soon as you get
even one bar of service.</i>

01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:34.267
Breakfast burrito?

01:16:35.302 --> 01:16:36.202
Thanks.

01:16:36.369 --> 01:16:37.336
Hey, Si.

01:16:39.608 --> 01:16:40.574
Come sit down.

01:16:43.343 --> 01:16:44.242
I'm gonna be late.

01:17:16.276 --> 01:17:17.176
Hey, guys.

01:17:17.710 --> 01:17:18.977
Hey, Simon, we need to talk.

01:17:19.913 --> 01:17:22.582
So Abby and I hung out
on New Year's Eve, and...

01:17:23.850 --> 01:17:24.750
you see, now we're together.

01:17:24.985 --> 01:17:26.920
That's awesome. That's great.

01:17:26.988 --> 01:17:27.886
Yeah, it is.

01:17:28.688 --> 01:17:31.022
But then we got to talking
about why it took so long.

01:17:31.992 --> 01:17:33.092
Why did you tell Nick
that I have

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:34.693
a boyfriend in college
named Jonathan?

01:17:34.762 --> 01:17:36.396
- Why'd you make that up?
- Look, Martin...

01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:37.964
he was the one who wrote

01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:39.597
that <i>CreekSecrets</i> post
about me.

01:17:40.033 --> 01:17:41.566
He screenshotted my emails

01:17:41.668 --> 01:17:44.636
and he's been using them
to blackmail me for months.

01:17:45.172 --> 01:17:47.140
What does that have to do
with us, Simon?

01:17:47.974 --> 01:17:49.074
He told me
that if I didn't help him

01:17:49.139 --> 01:17:51.276
get with Abby, he'd out me.

01:17:54.246 --> 01:17:55.146
And I...

01:17:56.015 --> 01:17:57.650
That's why I had to
keep you guys apart.

01:17:57.718 --> 01:17:59.252
So you made up a bunch of lies.

01:18:00.855 --> 01:18:01.788
And that's why
you convinced me

01:18:01.856 --> 01:18:02.821
to go on that date with Leah?

01:18:03.323 --> 01:18:04.757
You know, to keep me away
from Abby?

01:18:04.926 --> 01:18:06.927
So, wait. Running lines
at Waffle House

01:18:06.993 --> 01:18:08.693
and beer pong at Bram's,

01:18:08.862 --> 01:18:11.195
all of that was just to
pawn me off on Martin?

01:18:11.864 --> 01:18:13.531
I'm not
a piece of meat, Simon.

01:18:14.334 --> 01:18:16.434
You know how hard it was
for me to start over.

01:18:18.705 --> 01:18:19.972
I trusted you.

01:18:24.211 --> 01:18:25.979
Hey, come on, Leah.
I'll take you to school.

01:18:32.118 --> 01:18:34.886
Leah. Leah, please.
Listen, listen.

01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:36.287
I know I messed up, okay?

01:18:36.357 --> 01:18:37.790
But I knew you were
in love with Nick.

01:18:37.858 --> 01:18:39.625
- And I thought that maybe...
- Just stop it!

01:18:40.594 --> 01:18:42.428
You know what? You are
insanely stupid, Simon.

01:18:42.496 --> 01:18:45.697
I was never in love with Nick.
I was in love with you!

01:18:49.269 --> 01:18:50.168
Look...

01:18:51.437 --> 01:18:53.205
We're... We're us.

01:18:53.406 --> 01:18:54.506
Yeah, well...

01:18:55.009 --> 01:18:57.010
Sorry.

01:18:59.277 --> 01:19:00.946
I've been trying to tell you.

01:19:02.383 --> 01:19:06.384
That night I slept over,
I was trying to tell you.

01:19:09.021 --> 01:19:10.789
You wanna know
the funniest part?

01:19:11.592 --> 01:19:13.959
It's that all these years, you
being so picky with girls,

01:19:14.025 --> 01:19:16.094
I thought that maybe it was

01:19:16.162 --> 01:19:18.295
because you might
like me, too.

01:19:18.898 --> 01:19:20.265
And then, you know,
you told me

01:19:20.332 --> 01:19:21.232
I should go out with Nick

01:19:21.734 --> 01:19:23.468
and I realized you were just
never gonna see me that way.

01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:27.138
I can deal with you
being gay, Si.

01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:29.475
But you set me up
to get my heart broken

01:19:29.543 --> 01:19:30.976
when you thought
I was in love with Nick

01:19:31.044 --> 01:19:32.578
and that just makes you cruel.

01:20:02.609 --> 01:20:03.508
You all right?

01:20:03.778 --> 01:20:04.678
Hanging in there.

01:20:05.246 --> 01:20:07.214
Uh, for the record,

01:20:07.281 --> 01:20:09.882
when I was saying that we have
a lot in common, you know,

01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:12.219
I wasn't really... That's not
what I was talking about.

01:20:12.685 --> 01:20:13.584
Gotcha.

01:20:14.088 --> 01:20:15.288
Just FYI, just for the record.

01:20:15.355 --> 01:20:16.757
- Okay, great. Thanks.
- All right.

01:20:27.533 --> 01:20:28.767
Hey, Jackie.

01:20:29.001 --> 01:20:29.968
Did you date me

01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:31.504
because you think
I look like a guy?

01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:34.440
No. No, I actually
broke up with you

01:20:34.507 --> 01:20:36.241
because you don't look
like a guy.

01:20:36.642 --> 01:20:39.811
Oh. Oh, okay. Thanks.

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:41.380
Welcome.

01:20:56.595 --> 01:20:58.128
Yeah! Hey, Creekwood!

01:21:00.633 --> 01:21:02.200
This one's for you, Spier.

01:21:03.802 --> 01:21:04.836
Hey, Ethan.

01:21:05.671 --> 01:21:06.806
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, yeah.

01:21:11.010 --> 01:21:12.543
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

01:21:12.613 --> 01:21:14.647
You like that,
don't you, Spier?

01:21:15.883 --> 01:21:18.750
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, Ethan, Simon likey.

01:21:23.222 --> 01:21:24.589
You have something
you wanna say to me?

01:21:26.293 --> 01:21:27.759
I said do you have something
to say to me?

01:21:29.061 --> 01:21:30.795
- I'll take it from here.
- Hey, Ms. Albright.

01:21:31.029 --> 01:21:32.197
Don't "Hey, Ms. Albright" me.

01:21:32.265 --> 01:21:33.430
We're not friends.
You're not gonna

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:35.068
braid my hair
or paint my nails.

01:21:35.135 --> 01:21:36.702
Get your ass
off the table now!

01:21:36.871 --> 01:21:39.171
You sweaty, hormonal virgins.

01:21:39.504 --> 01:21:41.507
You know what? You're about to
be suspended for so long,

01:21:41.776 --> 01:21:43.375
that by the time it's over,
you're gonna be

01:21:43.476 --> 01:21:45.844
the fat, bald, unhappily married

01:21:45.913 --> 01:21:49.213
wildly mediocre nobodies
you're destined to become.

01:21:49.282 --> 01:21:50.748
You can't talk to us like that.

01:21:50.984 --> 01:21:52.450
Actually, I can,
'cause I just did.

01:21:52.618 --> 01:21:54.318
And you know why?
Because you're just those two

01:21:54.388 --> 01:21:55.755
assholes that did
that shitty thing

01:21:55.854 --> 01:21:58.555
in front of the whole school.
And guess what?

01:21:58.924 --> 01:22:02.059
Nobody feels sorry for those
assholes, especially me.

01:22:02.594 --> 01:22:04.896
Now, walk.
Mr. Worth's office now.

01:22:04.963 --> 01:22:05.864
Bye.

01:22:06.834 --> 01:22:08.033
Uh-uh. That's mine now.

01:22:08.468 --> 01:22:10.803
I'mma sell it.
Get my tubes tied.

01:22:27.286 --> 01:22:29.521
Why does Mr. Worth
have to talk to us?

01:22:30.455 --> 01:22:32.257
I mean, can't we just
let this shit go?

01:22:35.863 --> 01:22:37.230
Hey, I'm sorry, Ethan.

01:22:39.466 --> 01:22:41.934
None of this ever happened
when just you were out.

01:22:43.634 --> 01:22:45.503
You know what they say,
one gay's a snooze,

01:22:45.572 --> 01:22:47.406
two's a hilarious hate crime.

01:22:52.578 --> 01:22:54.480
You could've told me
you were gay.

01:22:56.849 --> 01:22:58.549
I guess I didn't think
we had very much in common.

01:22:58.685 --> 01:23:00.686
You're telling me, Simon.

01:23:00.753 --> 01:23:02.553
It's not like
your all-hoodie wardrobe

01:23:02.621 --> 01:23:03.722
rocks my world.

01:23:10.129 --> 01:23:11.230
I don't know.

01:23:11.866 --> 01:23:13.199
Maybe I was jealous.

01:23:14.301 --> 01:23:15.767
You've been out
since you were 16.

01:23:18.270 --> 01:23:20.005
It always seemed
so easy for you.

01:23:20.239 --> 01:23:21.340
Easy?

01:23:22.074 --> 01:23:23.308
Are you kidding me?

01:23:26.046 --> 01:23:27.912
My mom still tells
my grandparents

01:23:27.979 --> 01:23:29.280
about all the girls I'm dating

01:23:29.381 --> 01:23:32.351
when we go over to their house
for dinner, every Sunday.

01:23:33.253 --> 01:23:35.652
She says it's 'cause
they're old and religious,

01:23:36.155 --> 01:23:37.655
and it's just easier that way.

01:23:39.159 --> 01:23:40.525
I don't know,
maybe that's true.

01:23:41.526 --> 01:23:44.394
But you should hear her voice
when she talks about the girls.

01:23:50.001 --> 01:23:51.769
All right, boys, come on in.

01:23:52.839 --> 01:23:53.739
Come on.

01:23:55.174 --> 01:23:56.574
All right,
just stand right here.

01:23:59.177 --> 01:24:00.278
Get up.

01:24:03.614 --> 01:24:05.015
Okay, these gentlemen
have something

01:24:05.085 --> 01:24:06.217
that they would like
to say to you.

01:24:06.586 --> 01:24:08.252
- We're sorry.
- Our bad.

01:24:08.486 --> 01:24:10.287
That's right.
'Cause at Creekwood High,

01:24:10.355 --> 01:24:11.290
what do we believe in?

01:24:11.392 --> 01:24:12.291
Tolerance.

01:24:12.624 --> 01:24:14.759
And "tolerance" means
we respect

01:24:14.826 --> 01:24:16.593
Simon and Ethan's choice
to be boyfriends.

01:24:16.662 --> 01:24:18.362
- We are not boyfriends.
- Yeah. No.

01:24:18.664 --> 01:24:20.265
Hey, whatever you wanna
call it,

01:24:20.333 --> 01:24:21.433
it's fine with me. Seriously.

01:24:21.534 --> 01:24:23.601
We call it "two people

01:24:23.671 --> 01:24:25.437
that are not at all
romantically involved."

01:24:25.506 --> 01:24:26.940
Yeah, I get it.
Keepin' it casual, man.

01:24:27.006 --> 01:24:28.339
I can dig, seriously.

01:24:30.143 --> 01:24:32.943
Oh. Simon. Hey, can we talk?

01:24:33.545 --> 01:24:34.579
I don't have anything
to say to you.

01:24:34.647 --> 01:24:36.381
Please, please.
I just wanted to say

01:24:36.447 --> 01:24:37.348
that I was sorry, okay?

01:24:37.416 --> 01:24:39.183
I didn't know or think

01:24:39.251 --> 01:24:40.451
that people still did
shit like that.

01:24:40.585 --> 01:24:42.154
And I got in a lot of shit
for Homecoming,

01:24:42.223 --> 01:24:44.656
and I wanted everyone to focus
on something else, you know?

01:24:44.723 --> 01:24:46.290
I just didn't think
it was gonna be a big thing.

01:24:46.491 --> 01:24:48.192
I don't care if you didn't
think that my coming out

01:24:48.261 --> 01:24:49.795
was gonna be
a big thing, Martin.

01:24:51.131 --> 01:24:52.298
Look, you don't get to
decide that.

01:24:52.697 --> 01:24:55.066
I'm supposed to be the one
that decides when

01:24:55.134 --> 01:24:56.835
and where,
and how and who knows

01:24:56.903 --> 01:24:57.736
and how I get to say it.

01:24:57.804 --> 01:24:59.338
That's supposed to be
my thing!

01:24:59.437 --> 01:25:01.039
And you took that away
from me.

01:25:02.209 --> 01:25:04.910
So, well, can you please just
get the fuck away from me?

01:25:36.909 --> 01:25:39.978
<i>I saw the posts.
I know who you are.</i>

01:25:40.979 --> 01:25:41.679
Jacques a Dit.

01:25:41.983 --> 01:25:44.050
<i>That's what they call
Simon Says in France.</i>

01:25:44.416 --> 01:25:45.383
<i>Very clever.</i>

01:25:45.852 --> 01:25:48.419
<i>I'm sorry, Simon.
I can't do this anymore.</i>

01:25:48.487 --> 01:25:50.321
- <i>Please, Blue.</i>
- <i>I'm so sorry.</i>

01:25:50.624 --> 01:25:53.425
<i>You can't leave me alone.
Everything's falling apart.</i>

01:26:45.577 --> 01:26:46.644
I mean, I haven't even
talked to her.

01:26:46.712 --> 01:26:48.080
I haven't even
seen her at school.

01:26:50.415 --> 01:26:52.283
Anyway, I guess
I'll see you in class, right?

01:26:52.348 --> 01:26:53.548
- Yeah, totally.
- Okay.

01:26:53.752 --> 01:26:54.652
Later.

01:26:55.923 --> 01:26:57.756
- Hey.
- Hey, Simon.

01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:01.461
Is it you?

01:27:03.496 --> 01:27:04.596
Are you Blue?

01:27:05.463 --> 01:27:08.832
No. No, it's not me. Sorry.

01:27:12.338 --> 01:27:13.972
I know you've had
a crazy couple days.

01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:15.041
You wanna talk about it?

01:27:15.275 --> 01:27:17.374
No, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have asked.

01:27:17.708 --> 01:27:19.643
- No, don't worry.
- Sorry for bothering you.

01:28:00.853 --> 01:28:01.753
Did you know?

01:28:07.359 --> 01:28:09.060
I knew you had a secret.

01:28:14.134 --> 01:28:16.870
I mean, when you were little,
you were so carefree.

01:28:18.137 --> 01:28:22.572
But these last few years,
more and more...

01:28:24.042 --> 01:28:26.843
it's almost like I could
feel you holding your breath.

01:28:34.586 --> 01:28:36.522
I wanted to ask you
about it, but I...

01:28:37.421 --> 01:28:39.055
didn't wanna pry.

01:28:42.094 --> 01:28:45.796
- Maybe I made a mistake.
- No. No, Mom, you...

01:28:47.565 --> 01:28:48.932
You didn't make a mistake.

01:28:53.337 --> 01:28:55.372
Being gay is your thing.

01:28:56.173 --> 01:28:59.276
There are parts of it
you have to go through alone.

01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:00.880
I hate that.

01:29:02.147 --> 01:29:05.182
As soon as you came out,
you said, "Mom, I'm still me."

01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:10.556
I need you to hear this.

01:29:12.691 --> 01:29:15.260
You are still you, Simon.

01:29:17.596 --> 01:29:22.363
And you are still the same son
who I love to tease,

01:29:23.267 --> 01:29:26.871
and who your father depends on
for just about everything.

01:29:27.539 --> 01:29:28.839
And you're the same brother

01:29:29.139 --> 01:29:32.108
who always compliments
his sister on her food,

01:29:32.177 --> 01:29:34.111
even when it sucks.

01:29:37.749 --> 01:29:40.118
But you get to exhale now,
Simon.

01:29:42.087 --> 01:29:45.656
You get to be more you
than you have been...

01:29:47.759 --> 01:29:49.660
in a very long time.

01:29:56.869 --> 01:29:58.903
You deserve
everything you want.

01:30:13.617 --> 01:30:14.718
My boy.

01:30:31.536 --> 01:30:33.136
Hey, Leah.

01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:34.437
- Hey.
- What's up?

01:30:34.873 --> 01:30:35.973
What are you doing?

01:30:36.744 --> 01:30:38.276
Just going for a run,
you know.

01:30:39.177 --> 01:30:41.412
- Daily ritual.
- Yeah, you've never done that.

01:30:42.346 --> 01:30:43.246
Have too.

01:30:43.748 --> 01:30:45.117
But you're wearing jeans.

01:30:46.685 --> 01:30:47.617
They're my running jeans.

01:30:47.685 --> 01:30:49.418
Simon, you're about to pass out.

01:30:50.221 --> 01:30:52.122
Okay, fine.
I'm not going for a run.

01:30:53.392 --> 01:30:55.093
Hey, Leah. Please, listen.

01:30:55.161 --> 01:30:56.261
Look, I know, okay?

01:30:56.330 --> 01:30:57.896
You didn't want anyone
to know you're gay.

01:30:57.963 --> 01:30:59.364
No, that wasn't just it.

01:31:02.901 --> 01:31:04.270
I fell in love with someone.

01:31:05.805 --> 01:31:07.238
That guy in the emails...

01:31:09.241 --> 01:31:10.141
I love him.

01:31:11.211 --> 01:31:13.611
And I knew that if Martin
leaked our emails,

01:31:13.678 --> 01:31:14.879
it'd scare him off.

01:31:16.116 --> 01:31:17.015
I'm sorry.

01:31:19.785 --> 01:31:21.285
I know what I did
was messed up.

01:31:25.223 --> 01:31:26.123
You're my best friend.

01:31:26.557 --> 01:31:27.457
If I'm your best friend,

01:31:27.792 --> 01:31:29.192
then why did you come out
to Abby and not me?

01:31:32.264 --> 01:31:33.163
Think it was easier.

01:31:35.001 --> 01:31:36.636
I've known Abby for six months,

01:31:37.201 --> 01:31:40.271
and I've known you
for 13 years.

01:31:42.606 --> 01:31:43.807
And I knew that if I told you,

01:31:43.875 --> 01:31:45.877
that everything
was gonna be different.

01:31:47.812 --> 01:31:49.914
I really wanted things
to stay the same.

01:31:54.519 --> 01:31:56.153
Tell me about this guy
you love.

01:32:00.292 --> 01:32:01.759
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:32:02.361 --> 01:32:04.562
It'll help me kill off
Hetero Simon in my mind.

01:32:05.196 --> 01:32:07.763
- You don't have to kill him off.
- He's dead, Si.

01:32:08.133 --> 01:32:10.302
Hacking him up with
a mental machete as we speak.

01:32:12.970 --> 01:32:15.005
All right. Fair enough.

01:32:17.841 --> 01:32:19.042
So, I call him Blue.

01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:30.855
Hey, Si.

01:32:33.025 --> 01:32:33.925
Yeah?

01:32:44.669 --> 01:32:45.870
How long have you known?

01:32:48.139 --> 01:32:51.976
Like, I really started to get it
when I was around...

01:32:54.245 --> 01:32:55.145
thirteen?

01:32:55.446 --> 01:32:57.113
Four years? Four years of...

01:32:58.916 --> 01:32:59.883
eating dinner together,

01:33:00.052 --> 01:33:01.487
four years of
going to movies together.

01:33:01.622 --> 01:33:04.389
Four years of
walking Bieber together.

01:33:06.794 --> 01:33:07.893
I'm sorry.

01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:10.094
I shouldn't have missed it.

01:33:10.463 --> 01:33:12.263
No. Hey, no, Dad.

01:33:12.396 --> 01:33:13.563
All those stupid jokes...

01:33:14.633 --> 01:33:15.632
Well, I know
you didn't mean 'em.

01:33:15.869 --> 01:33:17.302
It doesn't matter.
I shouldn't have missed it.

01:33:21.472 --> 01:33:22.371
But...

01:33:22.907 --> 01:33:25.176
in case the message
got lost somewhere I just...

01:33:26.845 --> 01:33:28.879
I just want you to know
that I love you.

01:33:30.982 --> 01:33:32.415
And I'm really
proud of you.

01:33:33.919 --> 01:33:36.087
I wouldn't change anything
about you.

01:33:39.225 --> 01:33:40.424
Hey. Shit, Dad.

01:33:43.426 --> 01:33:44.327
Hey, stop crying.

01:33:44.561 --> 01:33:46.363
I'm trying. I'm trying.

01:33:47.565 --> 01:33:48.599
Oh, God.

01:33:51.202 --> 01:33:52.101
Come here.

01:34:01.945 --> 01:34:03.546
How's that video
for Mom coming?

01:34:03.913 --> 01:34:05.349
- Good.
- Good, good.

01:34:05.418 --> 01:34:06.319
Good.

01:34:09.121 --> 01:34:10.186
You don't know
how to export it, do you?

01:34:10.255 --> 01:34:11.422
Can you help me
with that, please?

01:34:11.489 --> 01:34:12.388
Yeah.

01:34:12.825 --> 01:34:13.925
- Okay.
- Let's go.

01:34:14.426 --> 01:34:15.326
Hey.

01:34:15.992 --> 01:34:18.260
I thought maybe we could
sign up for Grindr together.

01:34:19.331 --> 01:34:21.099
You don't know
what Grindr is, do you?

01:34:22.031 --> 01:34:24.067
It's Facebook for gay people.

01:34:24.636 --> 01:34:25.535
Not what it is.

01:34:29.474 --> 01:34:30.172
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:34:30.274 --> 01:34:32.475
I present to you
20 years of bliss.

01:34:41.152 --> 01:34:42.886
Did you guys do this?

01:34:43.887 --> 01:34:45.388
Simon and I did it, yeah.

01:34:46.325 --> 01:34:47.992
- I just helped.
- It was mostly me.

01:34:48.191 --> 01:34:49.659
Yeah, right.

01:34:53.866 --> 01:34:55.367
Really? Really?

01:34:57.033 --> 01:34:58.602
I can't believe
you did this.

01:34:59.371 --> 01:35:01.438
I panicked
and bought you a watch.

01:35:01.905 --> 01:35:02.905
That's okay.

01:35:03.206 --> 01:35:04.540
You can give me
somethin' later

01:35:04.611 --> 01:35:05.678
that I can't get in the store.

01:35:05.878 --> 01:35:06.944
That's really gross.

01:35:07.278 --> 01:35:09.445
- Oh, guys, just look.
- Sorry, just pay attention.

01:35:09.948 --> 01:35:11.048
Just look at baby Bieber!

01:35:11.116 --> 01:35:12.216
He was so cute!

01:35:12.283 --> 01:35:14.152
Just look at our baby!

01:36:43.641 --> 01:36:44.541

01:39:30.442 --> 01:39:32.108
I bet he's waiting

01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:52.889
- No, you're not.
- No, I'm not. I just...

01:40:53.956 --> 01:40:56.259
This is so brutal.

01:40:57.995 --> 01:40:59.429
Here. I'll tell you what.

01:40:59.798 --> 01:41:02.499
I got a couple...
How much is it?

01:41:03.066 --> 01:41:06.135
- It's four tickets, four bucks.
- Perfect. Okay. There you go.

01:41:06.237 --> 01:41:07.337
Last one's on me.

01:41:08.905 --> 01:41:09.805
Got it.

01:41:11.541 --> 01:41:13.710
Last call for the Ferris wheel!

01:41:15.979 --> 01:41:18.648
Oh, no, I can't watch.
I can't watch this, babe. No.

01:41:19.183 --> 01:41:20.083
This is awful.

01:41:20.651 --> 01:41:22.550
- Okay, Dora.
- Wait, wait.

01:41:24.289 --> 01:41:25.490
Can I sit there?

01:41:26.324 --> 01:41:27.891
I was kind of waiting
for somebody.

01:41:29.293 --> 01:41:30.394
Yeah, I know.

01:41:35.265 --> 01:41:36.499
It's Bram!

01:41:42.741 --> 01:41:43.641
It's you.

01:41:45.309 --> 01:41:46.409
It's me.

01:41:49.547 --> 01:41:51.115
But that night at the party...

01:41:51.316 --> 01:41:53.984
Yeah.
I was drunk and confused.

01:41:54.051 --> 01:41:56.918
And it ended, like,
a minute after you saw us.

01:42:00.257 --> 01:42:01.390
And you're Jewish.

01:42:02.091 --> 01:42:02.992
Yeah.

01:42:04.063 --> 01:42:04.996
Which is cool.

01:42:06.130 --> 01:42:07.530
And I'm black too.

01:42:08.831 --> 01:42:09.732
And gay.

01:42:11.136 --> 01:42:12.135
It's kind of crazy, huh?

01:42:12.369 --> 01:42:13.537
I didn't think you'd come.

01:42:14.805 --> 01:42:15.504
Me neither.

01:42:16.074 --> 01:42:19.409
Until I was walking towards you,
I didn't think I had it in me.

01:42:40.264 --> 01:42:41.863
Are you disappointed
that it's me?

01:42:45.804 --> 01:42:46.702
No.
