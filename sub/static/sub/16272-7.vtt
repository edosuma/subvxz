WEBVTT

00:00.611 --> 00:03.044
You know, Alan,
we can't say we're taking part

00:03.079 --> 00:05.213
in a Turkey Trot
if we don't dress the part.

00:05.248 --> 00:06.948
- Gobble gobble.
- You don't have to say

00:06.983 --> 00:08.616
"gobble gobble" after everything.

00:08.652 --> 00:10.451
Okay, I'll come up with
some other cool animal sounds.

00:10.487 --> 00:12.520
I tell you what, I hope
everyone at this race

00:12.555 --> 00:13.955
is ready to get
their asses lapped.

00:13.990 --> 00:16.157
Zorn, this is just for fun.
So don't do that thing

00:16.192 --> 00:19.260
where you run way too fast
and create a vacuum behind you.

00:19.296 --> 00:20.962
Remember the breast cancer walk?

00:20.997 --> 00:22.196
<i>Alan, I measured</i>

00:22.232 --> 00:24.555
your head while you were
sleeping. I think this will fit.

00:24.590 --> 00:26.329
I'm gonna go see what's up
with those bathrooms, so...

00:26.364 --> 00:28.269
Well, don't forgot
your turkey hat!

00:28.305 --> 00:29.771
Uh, for tomorrow, I was gonna
bring a Smorkleberry pie

00:29.806 --> 00:31.072
that I made... don't worry,
I followed the rules

00:31.107 --> 00:32.740
so we don't all get poisoned.

00:32.776 --> 00:34.575
If the berry's yellow,
you're okay, fellow.

00:34.611 --> 00:37.612
But the berry's red,
you're already dead.

00:37.647 --> 00:39.747
Zorn, I told you you can't come.

00:39.783 --> 00:42.101
I'm sorry, but this is the
first time since we were married

00:42.102 --> 00:44.419
that my mom agreed to
come over for Thanksgiving.

00:44.487 --> 00:45.787
Well, I thought
that was just one of your

00:45.822 --> 00:47.055
elaborate jokes
that doesn't make any sense.

00:47.090 --> 00:48.289
You know, like getting
engaged to Craig.

00:48.325 --> 00:51.159
So you wouldn't turn some
innocent comment into a big fight

00:51.194 --> 00:53.895
about politics and then hurl
her rental car into the sun?

00:53.930 --> 00:55.296
I mean, come on, that was...

00:55.332 --> 00:57.165
that was the old Zorn.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.900
Okay? That was
the Zorn that hated

00:58.935 --> 01:00.335
your horrible hag of a mother.

01:00.370 --> 01:03.504
I-I've changed into
the Zorn that can ignore

01:03.540 --> 01:06.374
that your mother's a horrible hag.
And I would never knowingly

01:06.409 --> 01:08.176
hurt someone if... Go time!

01:16.925 --> 01:19.960

01:20.123 --> 01:22.323
<i>I mean, this is
pretty much the best</i>

01:22.359 --> 01:24.258
summer music program out there.

01:24.294 --> 01:25.660
It's crazy, but I could actually

01:25.695 --> 01:27.428
see myself becoming
a musician one day.

01:27.464 --> 01:29.263
<i>No, that's not crazy.</i>

01:29.299 --> 01:30.631
No, I think it's great they're
letting boys do that now.

01:30.667 --> 01:33.301
Yeah, Mom says I can't do it 'cause
the program costs, like, ten grand.

01:33.336 --> 01:35.069
Well, you can
always ask your grandma.

01:35.105 --> 01:37.405
She's a hateful wench who should
be tediously destroyed,

01:37.440 --> 01:40.641
- but she is independently wealthy.
- I guess it won't

01:40.677 --> 01:42.844
- be that bad.
- Yeah, she totally deserves to die.

01:42.879 --> 01:45.325
Can you believe she thinks
I ruined your mom's life?

01:45.405 --> 01:47.181
Well, after you met Mom,
she did drop out of college

01:47.217 --> 01:49.384
and end up saddled
with a burdensome kid.

01:49.419 --> 01:51.319
- That's a good point.
- Well, for what it's worth,

01:51.354 --> 01:53.287
it does suck you can't come
to Thanksgiving.

01:53.323 --> 01:54.957
Hey, hey, hey, don't you
worry your little head

01:54.958 --> 01:56.591
about me, okay?
You go have fun with the family.

01:56.626 --> 01:58.459
<i>I got big plans
tomorrow anyway.</i>

01:58.495 --> 02:01.229
Big plans.

02:03.533 --> 02:06.601
Ugh, this itch is killing me.

02:10.073 --> 02:11.406
<i>- Zorn, I'm with a patient.
- Uh, no, no.</i>

02:11.441 --> 02:12.740
<i>I-I'll be quick, Dr. Klorpins.</i>

02:12.776 --> 02:14.475
I've got this itch in my penises area.

02:14.511 --> 02:17.512
And, uh, I ran this 5K yesterday,
so I think it might it have...

02:17.547 --> 02:19.013
<i>Yeah, Zorn, Zorn,
that's runner's rash.</i>

02:19.049 --> 02:21.416
<i>It's easily treatable.
You just need a dragon's fang</i>

02:21.451 --> 02:23.017
<i>and the blood of a royal infant.</i>

02:23.053 --> 02:26.354
<i>Mix it up into a paste
and slather it on your scrotums.</i>

02:26.389 --> 02:29.457
Oh, on all the scrotums.
Okay. All right, thanks, Doc.

Ow.

02:42.372 --> 02:43.604
What are you doing here, Linda?

02:43.640 --> 02:45.273
Avoiding Thanksgiving, 'cause I hate it.

02:45.308 --> 02:47.508
- What are you doing here?
- Missing Thanksgiving,

02:47.544 --> 02:48.976
'cause Edie's mom hates me.

02:49.012 --> 02:51.163
Also, my upstairs
neighbors play some song

02:51.164 --> 02:53.314
called "Black Hole Sun"
over and over real loud.

02:53.349 --> 02:55.083
I guess we're hanging out then.

02:55.118 --> 02:56.751
<i>So why does your mom
hate Zorn again?</i>

02:56.786 --> 02:58.319
<i>Well, can you blame her?</i>

02:58.354 --> 03:01.155
She was a single working mom,
gave her kids a great life,

03:01.191 --> 03:03.157
and then she just watched
me throw it all away

03:03.193 --> 03:05.860
by running off to Zephyria
and marrying a barbarian.

03:05.895 --> 03:07.395
You know, Edie, this might not
be the right time to say it,

03:07.430 --> 03:08.830
but you got a book in you.

03:08.865 --> 03:11.833
I just feel like,
after all these years,

03:11.868 --> 03:15.336
I'd like to show her that my life
is on a great track again.

03:15.371 --> 03:18.072
- Mm-hmm.
- My career, my family.

03:18.108 --> 03:20.141
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, my God, she's here.

03:20.176 --> 03:21.375
- All right.
- Okay.

03:21.411 --> 03:23.411
- Stop with the beans.
- Yep. Nope. I am.

03:23.946 --> 03:25.146
Hi, Mom.

03:25.181 --> 03:28.216
- Edie, hello!
- Hi.

03:28.251 --> 03:30.118
Happy Turkey Day, Roberta.

03:30.153 --> 03:31.219
- Craig.
- Hi.

03:31.254 --> 03:32.687
I swear, you haven't got

03:32.722 --> 03:35.189
one day older since
the last time I saw you.

03:35.225 --> 03:37.391
Oh, don't worry, I'm not a vampire.

03:37.427 --> 03:38.926
Or am I?

03:38.962 --> 03:41.537
- Oh...
- Hi, Grammy!

03:41.572 --> 03:43.203
I must not have heard
you come in, because I

03:43.238 --> 03:45.001
was practicing my music
in my room, you know?

03:45.036 --> 03:46.467
Music is my life.

03:46.503 --> 03:48.803
Well, darling, would you put
that down, go out to the car,

03:48.838 --> 03:51.439
get my luggage,
and put it in your room?

03:51.474 --> 03:54.054
- You're staying in my room?
- Yes.

03:54.089 --> 03:55.076
I don't know why
I said that as a question,

03:55.111 --> 03:57.345
because you are... Yeah.

03:57.380 --> 04:00.715
♪ Grandma is
the greatest generation ♪

04:00.750 --> 04:02.383
♪ Grandma... ♪

04:03.953 --> 04:05.753
Let me get those bags.

04:05.788 --> 04:08.122
- Bag 'em up, load 'em in!
- That's right.

04:08.158 --> 04:09.924
<i>No problem!</i>

04:09.959 --> 04:12.660
Mom, I'm so glad you're here.

04:12.695 --> 04:14.428
There's so much
I want to show you.

04:14.464 --> 04:17.697
If it's the wine stain on your
sweater, I've already seen that.

04:20.303 --> 04:21.601
Oh!

04:21.637 --> 04:23.704
<i>That one looks like a pig, right?</i>

04:23.740 --> 04:25.306
<i>Oh, and-and that one
looks like a throk-beast.</i>

04:25.341 --> 04:26.440
<i>Throk-beast?</i>

04:26.509 --> 04:29.110
It's like a cross between
a horse and a river chakraborg.

04:29.145 --> 04:32.280
Yeah. So, why do
you hate Thanksgiving?

04:32.315 --> 04:35.183
Me, I mean, I'll take any excuse
to be with my family.

04:35.218 --> 04:38.686
I grew up on a farm.
I had a pet turkey.

04:38.721 --> 04:41.589
You love a turkey, then tell me
you're okay with Thanksgiving.

04:41.624 --> 04:43.157
No, no, I hear you.

04:43.193 --> 04:45.159
I mean, raise a child
and then tell me you still

04:45.195 --> 04:48.329
love the Spring Child-Eating
Festival, right?

04:48.364 --> 04:52.254
- So, you're not allowed at Thanksgiving?
- Yeah, you know,

04:52.255 --> 04:55.136
my ex-wife thinks I'm gonna
go all Zorn on her mom.

04:55.171 --> 04:57.205
Uh, that's a saying
about someone else, by the way.

04:57.240 --> 04:59.574
Zorn Paulson.
But, I mean, come on.

04:59.609 --> 05:01.396
- You can see I've changed, right?
- Yeah, I mean,

05:01.397 --> 05:04.011
when I first met you,
you were violent and incompetent.

05:04.047 --> 05:06.614
And now you're...
less those things.

05:06.683 --> 05:08.049
Oh, you know what?

05:08.084 --> 05:09.650
I should just crash
Thanksgiving dinner,

05:09.686 --> 05:11.819
whether they like it or not,
and prove to Edie

05:11.854 --> 05:12.920
and her mom that I've changed!

05:12.956 --> 05:15.709
<i>Go time!</i>

05:16.259 --> 05:17.892
<i>The place is amazing.</i>

05:17.927 --> 05:21.495
It really is, and in a way,
you've removed every trace

05:21.531 --> 05:24.465
- of Zorn... except for Zorn, of course.
- Well, like I said,

05:24.500 --> 05:27.435
he only moved back here
for Alan's sake.

05:27.470 --> 05:31.005
Well, you're Alan's mother.
If you think it's important,

05:31.040 --> 05:34.909
- I trust you know best.
- Thank you.

05:34.944 --> 05:37.311
Oh, hello there, sweet Grandmother.

05:37.347 --> 05:40.047
I, uh, stripped my bedding and
put on your special sheets.

05:40.083 --> 05:42.116
The ones you brought
from home for one night.

05:42.185 --> 05:44.952
I wish I'd remember to
bring my memory foam pillow.

05:44.988 --> 05:46.587
Yours are always so hard.

05:46.623 --> 05:49.090
Oh, well.
What's a little neck pain?

05:49.125 --> 05:51.993
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the gravy has been boated.</i>

05:52.028 --> 05:56.297
The S.S. Thanksgiving Dinner
is about to set sail.

06:00.670 --> 06:03.838
Can I get you a glass of wine?

06:03.873 --> 06:06.207
- Sauvignon blanc?
- Good memory, Alan.

06:09.946 --> 06:12.947
Happy Thanksgiving!

06:12.982 --> 06:14.615
Aw, come on,
we both knew I was coming.

06:18.894 --> 06:21.622
Okay, I know what you're
thinking. "Zorn's here

06:21.657 --> 06:23.190
- to ruin Thanksgiving.
- Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

06:23.225 --> 06:25.025
But, look,
I'm a changed Zorn, okay?

06:25.061 --> 06:28.195
I'm wearing a turtleneck,
and-and I made a pie.

06:28.230 --> 06:31.547
Hey. I was just listening
through the door with this cup.

06:31.582 --> 06:34.501
Shut up, Craig!
No, I mean, shut up, Craig?

06:34.537 --> 06:37.171
Edie, he's Alan's father.
He's family.

06:37.206 --> 06:38.906
And every year on this day,

06:38.941 --> 06:41.842
families across America
set aside their petty squabbles.

06:41.877 --> 06:44.611
They share a bird,
a side of stuffing...

06:44.647 --> 06:46.880
- Craig...
- I'm not finished.

06:46.916 --> 06:50.651
Now, if we can't come
together as a family

06:50.686 --> 06:52.619
on Thanks-gosh-damn-giving,

06:52.655 --> 06:54.288
then I may as well pour gravy

06:54.323 --> 06:57.825
all over you and take a big bite
out of your breast.

06:57.860 --> 07:00.451
Because you're the turkey.

07:01.731 --> 07:05.532
- Give me the stupid pie.
- Yeah.

07:05.568 --> 07:08.402
Yes! I am through the door
and smelling that turkey.

07:08.437 --> 07:09.970
- Dad!
- Mom, I'm so sorry.

07:10.005 --> 07:12.638
- I didn't know he was coming.
- Hello, Roberta.

07:12.673 --> 07:13.540
Look, I know we've had our problems,

07:13.576 --> 07:15.909
but I'd like to start over.
If you're uncomfortable though,

07:15.945 --> 07:17.644
- I will go.
- That's not necessary.

07:17.680 --> 07:20.948
It is Thanksgiving.
Plus, the food's already dead.

07:20.983 --> 07:25.251
It's not like he can re-kill it.

07:28.157 --> 07:30.858
You got me there, Roberta!

07:30.893 --> 07:34.294
I have killed a lot of stuff
in my day, haven't I?

07:37.767 --> 07:39.166
Yeah.

07:40.936 --> 07:42.302
I like to laugh. Yeah.

07:42.338 --> 07:44.271
Not sure if you know that
about me, Roberta.

07:44.306 --> 07:46.340
You know, there's probably a lot
you don't know about me.

07:46.375 --> 07:48.942
'Cause I've changed so much.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.514
<i>So, Edie, did you tell your mom</i>

07:53.549 --> 07:55.048
about the big event
you just planned?

07:55.084 --> 07:57.284
<i>Oh, right, the 25th anniversary</i>

07:57.319 --> 08:00.287
- of the Orange County Observatory.
- Oh.

08:00.322 --> 08:02.757
Yeah. Matt Lauer was
there. He walked the orange

08:02.758 --> 08:05.192
carpet, which is funny
because it's Orange County.

08:05.227 --> 08:08.962
- Zorn. I hear you got a new job.
- I do. Yeah.

08:08.998 --> 08:11.165
But, hey, don't let
the turtleneck fool you.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.399
I'm actually a collar guy now.

08:12.434 --> 08:15.669
- Yeah, a white collar guy.
- Oh, wonderful.

08:15.704 --> 08:17.404
<i>Now that you're
working a normal job,</i>

08:17.439 --> 08:22.042
you think it might be time
to consider wearing pants?

08:22.077 --> 08:23.343
Well, technically they're not required.

08:23.379 --> 08:26.513
And in many cultures,
a furry panty is considered a pant.

08:26.549 --> 08:28.549
Sounds like you don't
know how to put 'em on.

08:31.320 --> 08:33.352
No, I, uh... I know how
to put on pants, Roberta.

08:33.389 --> 08:35.489
I mean, sure, no, I mean, I
didn't used to wear them, but

08:35.524 --> 08:36.924
now you know, just...
all the time.

08:36.958 --> 08:39.092
No, totally into pants.
Big pants guy.

08:39.128 --> 08:41.495
Here... I mean, here, let me,
uh... I'll-I'll show you.

08:42.498 --> 08:45.232
- Stop it, Zorn.
- Dad, stop it.

08:45.267 --> 08:47.501
What? I'm trying to pull
Craig's pants off to demonstrate.

08:47.536 --> 08:50.237
- Inappropriate.
- Look, Zorn, all you had to do was ask.

08:50.272 --> 08:52.639
I will give you my pants.
Sorry.

08:52.675 --> 08:56.243
- Wh... This is...
- Here.

08:56.278 --> 08:57.611
<i>All right, here we go, here we go.</i>

08:57.646 --> 08:59.613
Putting the pants on.
'Cause I totally know

08:59.648 --> 09:04.251
how to put on pants.
Just got to stick my foot into...

09:04.286 --> 09:05.886
this little side hole thing.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.221
Dad, that's the pocket.

09:07.256 --> 09:08.956
You got to put it
through the long tube...

09:08.991 --> 09:12.292
I can do it myself!

09:14.096 --> 09:17.431
Damn you!

09:17.466 --> 09:18.899
Why are they so tight?

09:18.934 --> 09:21.158
<i>You know, it kind of makes sense.</i>

09:21.159 --> 09:24.805
If you spend all your time
running around killing people

09:24.840 --> 09:28.942
and burning down villages, pants
might not be a big priority, right?

09:28.978 --> 09:32.412
- Okay, you know something, Roberta?
- No, do you know something, Zorn?

09:32.448 --> 09:35.082
About the new craft sodas
I just bought?

09:35.117 --> 09:37.684
A cola that tastes
like bubble gum.

09:37.720 --> 09:40.787
That's something you have
to see to believe, come on.

09:42.791 --> 09:44.157
Look, Zorn,

09:44.193 --> 09:46.727
I don't need you to see
my soda collection.

09:46.795 --> 09:49.429
Although I would like
for you to see it at some point.

09:49.465 --> 09:52.366
- But it's in the garage.
- I'd like to bury Roberta in the garage.

09:52.401 --> 09:54.801
Look, I know
how tough Roberta can be.

09:54.837 --> 09:57.571
Which is why I developed
a method for dealing

09:57.606 --> 09:59.940
with people like her. Whenever
Roberta says something mean,

09:59.975 --> 10:02.409
just try agreeing with it.
You'll catch her off guard,

10:02.444 --> 10:04.311
and she may even say
something nice.

10:04.346 --> 10:06.213
- Yeah, I don't really...
- Let's role-play, all right?

10:06.248 --> 10:10.817
I'll be Roberta.
"Zorn, you smell bad."

10:11.720 --> 10:14.221
Okay, Zorn,
I'm just being Roberta.

10:14.256 --> 10:18.191
Okay, maybe this whole agreeing
method is just too hard.

10:18.227 --> 10:21.895
No, I agree.
It is too hard for me.

10:21.931 --> 10:25.165
Okay, now I can't tell if you get it
or if it's too hard.

10:25.200 --> 10:28.802
I agree that you can't tell.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.137
♪ Grandma ♪

10:30.172 --> 10:33.607
♪ Likes to play in the sand-mah ♪

10:33.642 --> 10:36.276
Now imagine that
with a backing track

10:36.312 --> 10:38.078
- and some real funky percussive bass.
- Uh-huh.

10:38.113 --> 10:39.646
That's only the kind of thing

10:39.682 --> 10:40.981
you could learn in a
really good music program.

10:43.085 --> 10:45.085
Well, that didn't take too long.

10:45.120 --> 10:47.487
Uh, yeah, sorry.
I was just, uh.

10:47.523 --> 10:49.089
learning about Craig's
bubblegum sodas.

10:49.124 --> 10:50.424
Fascinating, fascinating stuff.

10:50.459 --> 10:52.125
<i>Well, that's impressive.</i>

10:52.161 --> 10:56.029
I know how hard it is
for Zephyrians to learn things.

10:56.065 --> 10:57.898
Um... Well, us barbarians

10:57.933 --> 11:00.267
do have difficulties learning,
that is true.

11:00.302 --> 11:02.436
I mean, is it because
in Zephyria learning

11:02.437 --> 11:04.571
is considered a sex crime?
Maybe. Maybe it is.

11:04.606 --> 11:06.239
I mean, who's to say, you know?

11:06.275 --> 11:08.208
But the main thing is I agree.

11:08.243 --> 11:09.676
Well, I'm glad
to hear you say that.

11:09.712 --> 11:13.547
- Bit long-winded, but...
- I agree!

11:13.582 --> 11:15.115
Speaking of Zephyria, Zorn,

11:15.150 --> 11:19.486
recently I saw
a fantastic documentary online.

11:19.521 --> 11:20.988
There's a doc about Zephyria?

11:21.023 --> 11:24.858
<i>Zephyria, a land made desolate by war,</i>

11:24.893 --> 11:28.662
<i>a landscape ravaged by laser
beam holes and acid-slime craters.</i>

11:28.697 --> 11:30.464
Sounds nice.

11:30.499 --> 11:32.632
<i>But amidst the chaos,
there remains</i>

11:32.668 --> 11:36.703
<i>one true defender of Zephyria...
Vulchazor.</i>

11:36.739 --> 11:38.538
What? He's not the defender!

11:38.574 --> 11:40.507
<i>Despite what you might
have heard about Vulchazor,</i>

11:40.542 --> 11:43.310
<i>I recently visited his lair
in Zephyria,</i>

11:43.345 --> 11:45.245
<i>- and I saw a softer side of him.
- Ugh, come on.</i>

11:45.280 --> 11:46.613
<i>Vulchazor collects
old Jazz records.</i>

11:46.648 --> 11:48.849
What?
Nickelback is jazz now?

11:48.884 --> 11:50.584
<i>And he's more
comfortable in his garden</i>

11:50.619 --> 11:53.420
- than on the battlefield.
- Oh, boy. This is...

11:53.455 --> 11:55.922
<i>But no matter
how peacefully this noble,</i>

11:55.958 --> 11:59.326
<i>bird-headed man tries
to lead his life, he is hounded</i>

11:59.361 --> 12:02.496
<i>by his archnemesis,
the war criminal,</i>

12:02.531 --> 12:04.331
- Zorn.
- What?!

12:04.366 --> 12:05.866
Lies! All of it.

12:05.901 --> 12:07.467
- Lies.
- Zorn!

12:07.503 --> 12:08.935
I grew up in front of that thing.

12:08.971 --> 12:11.204
Okay, I'm just gonna say it...
Dang.

12:11.240 --> 12:13.340
Okay, look.
If you believe this propaganda,

12:13.375 --> 12:15.675
then, Roberta,
you are as empty-headed

12:15.711 --> 12:17.544
as that glombeast
I stabbed the brains out of.

12:17.579 --> 12:18.645
<i>You see?</i>

12:18.680 --> 12:21.848
You see there?
He's gone full barbarian on me.

12:21.884 --> 12:23.550
Mom, I'm so sorry.
Zorn is leaving.

12:23.585 --> 12:27.120
And we can go back to the
table and finish dinner.

12:27.156 --> 12:30.857
- I don't think I have an appetite.
- What? This is crazy?

12:30.893 --> 12:33.293
- I'll be in my room.
- How can someone ever say Vulchazor

12:33.328 --> 12:35.462
is the good guy?
Even his name sounds evil.

12:35.497 --> 12:37.831
"Vulchazor."
Not like, you know,

12:37.866 --> 12:41.668
Zorn! See?
"Vulchazor", Zorn.

12:41.703 --> 12:45.372
Can you hear the difference?
"Vulchazor", Zorn!

12:45.407 --> 12:47.641
<i>Your mother basically called me
a war criminal.</i>

12:47.676 --> 12:50.544
If there's one time you can't
be a criminal, it is during war.

12:50.579 --> 12:53.213
- That is a fact.  - God, I should have
never let you in the house.

12:53.248 --> 12:55.182
All I wanted today,
was for my mom to see

12:55.217 --> 12:57.184
that after all the mistakes
I've made,

12:57.219 --> 12:59.920
- my life is finally in a good place.
- Thanks a lot, Dad.

12:59.955 --> 13:01.588
I was this close to music school.

13:01.623 --> 13:04.775
Okay, okay, okay, look, look, look,
none of this was my fault,

13:04.776 --> 13:08.629
like, at all, but I'll be the
bigger man and apologize. Happy?

13:09.465 --> 13:10.630
Roberta, look, I'm, uh,

13:10.666 --> 13:12.632
I'm really sorry
about what happened,

13:12.668 --> 13:15.235
and I brought you some
smorkleberry pie.

13:17.673 --> 13:20.507
All right, let's drop this act,
you little son of a bitch.

13:20.542 --> 13:22.876
You ruined my daughter's life.

13:22.911 --> 13:25.011
She had everything going for her
until you came along

13:25.047 --> 13:27.147
and dragged her by the hair
into some cave.

13:27.182 --> 13:30.117
I dragged her by her jean jacket,
and she liked it.

13:30.152 --> 13:33.607
You're a poison to this family.

13:37.025 --> 13:39.493
Okay, fine.
You hate me, I hate you,

13:39.528 --> 13:41.795
but can't we just pretend
to get along for one meal?

13:41.830 --> 13:43.730
Please?

13:43.765 --> 13:46.074
Okay, I'm coming in!

13:51.773 --> 13:53.151
Wait a minute, hold on a second.

13:53.152 --> 13:56.115
"If the berry's yellow,
you're not okay, fellow."

13:56.150 --> 13:58.607
Well, shoot!
That's just confusing.

13:58.884 --> 14:01.500
Oh, my God,
what am I gonna do?

14:01.536 --> 14:02.868
"Edie, I killed your mom."

14:02.904 --> 14:04.770
No, no, no, no, no.
Can't say it like that.

14:04.806 --> 14:07.499
"Hey, Edie. Could I get the
number for your masseuse?"

14:07.534 --> 14:08.741
Why is that weird?

14:08.776 --> 14:11.343
Well, then I won't schedule her
on the same day as you, okay?

14:11.379 --> 14:13.112
You know what?
I'm getting the feeling

14:13.147 --> 14:15.967
that this isn't about
a scheduling conflict. Yeah.

14:16.002 --> 14:17.783
No, uh, no, I'm starting
to think that maybe you complain

14:17.819 --> 14:19.585
to her about me while you're
getting massages.

14:19.620 --> 14:21.320
Well, don't you think she'd want
to meet me

14:21.355 --> 14:22.655
after hearing so much about me?

14:22.690 --> 14:26.225
No. If it's that big of a deal,
never mind. God!

14:26.260 --> 14:28.194
Also, I killed your mom.

14:28.229 --> 14:30.262
Yeah.
Yeah, that's the way to go.

14:30.298 --> 14:33.599
Stupid, itchy...
Wait, wait, wait.

14:38.706 --> 14:40.506
<i>Zorn, I'm with a p...</i>

14:40.541 --> 14:42.133
<i>Huh. Never mind.
What can I do you for?</i>

14:42.168 --> 14:43.409
Yeah, uh, is there some way

14:43.444 --> 14:45.311
to undo poisoning someone
with smorkleberries?

14:45.346 --> 14:48.781
<i>Does a Grithian herdsman
have nine anuses?</i>

14:48.816 --> 14:51.484
<i>I'm asking because I'm treating
this Grithian herdsman</i>

14:51.519 --> 14:53.719
<i>and I'm not sure he
has the right number.</i>

14:53.755 --> 14:56.589
I can't believe that I thought
for one second Zorn had changed.

14:56.624 --> 14:59.024
Well, to be fair,
don't you think that Roberta

14:59.060 --> 15:00.993
was pushing Zorn's buttons
a little bit?

15:01.028 --> 15:04.430
- Do you think that?
- No.

15:04.465 --> 15:06.332
Let me go look for that
microbead pillow.

15:06.367 --> 15:08.534
<i>Psst.</i>

15:08.569 --> 15:09.835
<i>Hey.</i>

15:09.871 --> 15:12.438
<i>Over here.</i>

15:14.876 --> 15:16.776
Dad, what is it?
What do you...

15:16.811 --> 15:18.310
Oh, my God,
you killed Grandma!

15:18.346 --> 15:20.212
<i>I didn't kill her...
Uh, no, actually, I did.</i>

15:20.248 --> 15:22.715
But, know what? It's cool,
'cause I can bring her back.

15:22.750 --> 15:24.350
From the dead?
Are you kidding?

15:24.385 --> 15:26.585
What? Are you just gonna
brew a magic potion?

15:26.621 --> 15:28.154
Oh, you spoke to Klorpins
already. Great.

15:28.189 --> 15:29.388
Okay, that saves me
a lot of explaining.

15:29.423 --> 15:31.390
<i>But I'm gonna need
your help, okay?</i>

15:31.425 --> 15:33.826
I need you to gather
these ingredients.

15:33.861 --> 15:36.729
"Three sprigs of eucalyptus.
A bone of beast"?

15:36.764 --> 15:39.932
What is this crap? I'm not gonna...
How am I gonna find this?

15:39.967 --> 15:41.600
That sounds like an
Alangulon problem to me.

15:41.636 --> 15:44.136
♪ The dishes in the sink get
scrubbed, scrubbed, scrubbed ♪

15:44.172 --> 15:47.239
- # Scrubbed, scrubbed, scrubbed #
- Bone of beast.

15:47.275 --> 15:48.707
<i>♪ Scrubbed, scrubbed, scrubbed ♪</i>

15:48.743 --> 15:50.876
- # The dishes in the sink. #
- Hey.

15:50.912 --> 15:52.912
Ha. I love that song.

15:52.947 --> 15:55.114
- Did I tell you that?
- Oh, thank you so much.

15:55.149 --> 15:56.482
I wish I could take credit for it,

15:56.517 --> 15:59.018
but it's been in my family
for generations.

15:59.086 --> 16:01.687
- Hmm.
- What are you hiding behind your back?

16:01.722 --> 16:04.390
- Nothing.
- Really? Because the wishbone

16:04.425 --> 16:06.258
was drying over here
a second ago.

16:06.294 --> 16:09.595
- Uh...
- Alan, look, I can't let you

16:09.630 --> 16:11.630
be alone with it until
the official breaking.

16:11.666 --> 16:13.410
Uh, Craig, come on. I need it.

16:13.445 --> 16:14.745
- Can you just give it to me?
- No, Alan.

16:14.780 --> 16:16.936
Please, I want to wish that my
dad's cancer will go away.

16:16.971 --> 16:18.904
Craig, give it.
Just, Craig, I need it.

16:18.940 --> 16:21.440
- Oh.
- Oh.

16:21.475 --> 16:23.576
Alan, what the hell is going on here?

16:25.246 --> 16:26.478
- Okay, I got all the stuff you needed...
- Oh, Alangulon.

16:26.514 --> 16:27.980
- Look, I solved it.
- Oh!

16:28.015 --> 16:29.715
Hey! What's he doing here?

16:29.750 --> 16:31.650
I filled Craig in on everything,
all right?

16:31.686 --> 16:33.719
- He's here to help.
- I'd really like to help

16:33.754 --> 16:35.354
you bring her back from the dead.

16:35.389 --> 16:36.889
Too many of my patients
have killed themselves.

16:53.140 --> 16:54.573
- Nothing.
- Why isn't it working?

16:54.609 --> 16:56.942
I did everything Klorpins said to.

16:56.978 --> 16:58.711
<i>- Zorn, I'm with a...
- Yeah, Doc, look,</i>

16:58.746 --> 17:01.513
I followed your potion to the T,
and the old girl is still dead.

17:01.549 --> 17:02.982
<i>Did you kiss her yet?
You always have</i>

17:03.017 --> 17:04.583
<i>to kiss people
back from the dead.</i>

17:04.618 --> 17:06.417
<i>You don't have to be
a cave doctor to know that.</i>

17:06.454 --> 17:08.820
Ugh! Gross.
Alan, kiss your grandmother.

17:08.856 --> 17:11.690
I can't commit incest.

17:13.027 --> 17:17.796
Well... I mean, I guess she's
not my mother-in-law yet, so...

17:17.832 --> 17:19.837
it's not weird, right?

17:20.667 --> 17:23.102
Yeah, it's weird.

17:28.309 --> 17:31.877
<i>- Uh, nope. More tongue.
- Are you serious?!</i>

17:31.913 --> 17:33.479
<i>Also, you have to do
that thing where you suck</i>

17:33.514 --> 17:36.221
<i>on her bottom lip real sexy.</i>

17:36.784 --> 17:38.751
Ugh. Gross.

17:38.786 --> 17:41.787
<i>Ah. Uh, tilt me down a little.
Yeah, yeah.</i>

17:41.822 --> 17:43.789
Gross.

17:43.824 --> 17:47.026
Oh, she's coming back!
It's working!

17:49.897 --> 17:52.197
Craig! Are you kissing my mom?!

17:52.233 --> 17:54.133
Edie, it's not what you think.

17:54.168 --> 17:56.802
Zorn killed your mom,
and I'm bringing her back to life.

17:56.837 --> 17:59.343
- What?!
- Nice, Craig.

17:59.463 --> 18:02.528
<i>- Zorn, you killed my mom!
- And brought her back to life. </i>

18:02.564 --> 18:05.164
- You keep leaving that part out.
- She was right about you all along.

18:05.199 --> 18:07.266
I should have never
let you back into our lives!

18:07.302 --> 18:08.301
- Mom!
- Come on, Edie.

18:08.336 --> 18:11.704
No, no, hey.
She's right. It was all me.

18:11.739 --> 18:15.808
I mean, all I wanted was to
spend Thanksgiving with you guys,

18:15.843 --> 18:18.077
but I've obviously ruined everything.

18:18.112 --> 18:19.946
I-I thought I'd changed,

18:19.981 --> 18:22.782
but then I show up
and I kill an elderly lady.

18:22.817 --> 18:25.585
So, I, uh... I'm sorry.

18:25.620 --> 18:27.053
You guys can keep the pie,

18:27.088 --> 18:29.055
but, you know, probably
don't want to eat it.

18:29.090 --> 18:31.781
Maybe you can have some,
though, Craig.

18:34.729 --> 18:38.097
So, I was dead for 40 minutes?

18:38.132 --> 18:41.133
Yeah. Crazy, right?
Really makes you think about life

18:41.169 --> 18:43.002
and, like, following
your dreams and stuff.

18:43.037 --> 18:45.922
Which for me, personally, it's attending

18:45.923 --> 18:48.808
- a summer music program.
- Alan, I'm not an idiot.

18:48.843 --> 18:51.410
I know that you have
been working me all day

18:51.446 --> 18:53.779
to get me to pay
for that music program.

18:53.815 --> 18:56.082
- Me? No, I haven't been...
- I'll do it.

18:56.117 --> 18:59.619
That's great! Oh, my...
Grandma, that's so cool...

18:59.654 --> 19:02.221
The only thing
I ask in return is that

19:02.256 --> 19:04.457
- you never speak to Zorn again.
- What?

19:04.492 --> 19:08.260
- Mom... what are you doing?
- Uh, Edie, um...

19:08.296 --> 19:09.895
Alan, can you
excuse us, please?

19:09.931 --> 19:13.326
Hey, Alan, you can help me
clean the brine bucket.

19:13.361 --> 19:16.469
<i>Okay, yeah, mm-hmm.</i>

19:17.105 --> 19:18.971
Mom, Zorn is his father.

19:19.007 --> 19:21.907
Alan loves him.
You can't ask that of someone.

19:21.943 --> 19:24.944
How many more lives
does Zorn get to ruin?

19:24.979 --> 19:26.712
He is a poison.

19:26.748 --> 19:30.750
I am the only one fighting
to save this family from a poison.

19:30.785 --> 19:33.853
- That's all I'm trying to do.
- So you were pushing his buttons.

19:33.888 --> 19:35.721
I was looking out for you.

19:35.757 --> 19:38.090
You know, when you said
you were coming to visit,

19:38.126 --> 19:41.861
I thought finally, finally,
you might look at my life

19:41.896 --> 19:44.163
and, I don't know, be proud of me.

19:44.198 --> 19:46.766
Oh... Edie...

19:46.801 --> 19:49.726
you've always been
such a needy child.

19:51.839 --> 19:56.275
You know, Mom,
Zorn is not the poison here.

19:56.310 --> 19:58.878
Well... if you're gonna choose
that barbarian

19:58.913 --> 20:01.414
over your own mother,
maybe I should leave.

20:01.449 --> 20:04.383
I guess maybe you should.

20:08.923 --> 20:10.623
<i>But no matter how peacefully</i>

20:10.658 --> 20:12.992
<i>this noble bird-headed man
tries to lead his life...</i>

20:13.027 --> 20:15.127
Three-quarters of this is lies!

20:15.163 --> 20:18.364
But damn it if it's not well done.

20:23.237 --> 20:26.806
- So, she just took off?
- It was hard. Really hard.

20:26.841 --> 20:28.441
But the thing is,
she's always been this way.

20:28.476 --> 20:31.559
- I just didn't see it until now.
- I guess you were right...

20:31.594 --> 20:36.482
- people never really change.
- No. Sometimes they do.

20:36.517 --> 20:38.984
Wow. I should've killed
your mom years ago.

20:39.020 --> 20:42.922
See? That's what
Thanksgiving is all about.

20:42.957 --> 20:44.090
Family.

20:44.125 --> 20:48.434
Mending old relationships,
making new ones.

20:48.469 --> 20:52.595
Aw, [bleep] you,
son of a [bleep], Craig.

20:53.701 --> 20:55.301
Zorn.

21:00.313 --> 21:04.935
