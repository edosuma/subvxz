WEBVTT

00:27.728 --> 00:31.031
Stop what you're doing
immediately and look at me!

00:32.466 --> 00:34.135
I'm looking, bro.

00:34.168 --> 00:36.404
Ready for the most amazing
sight, ever, ever, ever, ever?

00:36.437 --> 00:38.672
My eyes can't take
the anticipation.

00:44.445 --> 00:45.813
Is it hiding behind the bird?

00:45.846 --> 00:47.815
It is the bird!

00:47.848 --> 00:49.483
Isn't nature amazing?

00:50.884 --> 00:52.653
It's just a bird, brah.

00:52.686 --> 00:55.389
Oh, look, I'm a bird.
Am I amazing?

00:55.423 --> 00:57.491
Oh, my goodness, yes!

00:57.525 --> 01:00.428
No, bro, not amazing at all.

01:07.435 --> 01:11.272
Dearest friend, Raven,
I must show you
something wondrous.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.540
Cool, thanks for sharing it.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.842
But you have not even seen
the "it" yet.

01:14.875 --> 01:15.876
I get the gist.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.745
-Look!
-No.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.480
Look!

01:20.714 --> 01:22.316
Urgh!

01:22.350 --> 01:25.353
Behold, the object of beauty!

01:27.888 --> 01:29.890
You made me open
my lids for a shell?

01:29.923 --> 01:32.426
Does its colorful exterior
not bring you

01:32.460 --> 01:34.195
the feelings of joy?

01:34.228 --> 01:36.497
I hate colorful things.

01:40.434 --> 01:43.171
Oh, I didn't mean that.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.773
I hold a tiny miracle
in my hand, and he's all,

01:45.806 --> 01:46.874
"Whatever, bro."

01:46.907 --> 01:49.243
This shell has captured
the colors of the rainbow

01:49.277 --> 01:52.380
and Raven responds
with a "uh."

01:54.315 --> 01:58.652
Look at the cutest
of baby birds you are holding!

01:58.686 --> 02:00.554
* Baby bird, baby bird

02:00.588 --> 02:02.290
* Oh, how I love that birds

02:02.323 --> 02:04.392
* are still the baby

02:04.425 --> 02:06.227
* Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp

02:10.431 --> 02:14.235
I think that's the shell
this little guy hatched from.

02:14.268 --> 02:15.469
Look!

02:21.209 --> 02:22.676
-I don't believe it!

02:22.710 --> 02:24.478
-Oh, there you are.
-Oh, there he is.

02:24.512 --> 02:25.746
There!

02:30.384 --> 02:32.520
The birds hatch
out of the eggs?

02:32.553 --> 02:34.255
Not all eggs.

02:34.288 --> 02:35.956
How can we be sure?

02:35.989 --> 02:38.392
I never thought
about it like that.

02:38.426 --> 02:40.894
We must free
the imprisoned birdies!

02:42.963 --> 02:45.766
So, you think
you're hard boiled?

02:45.799 --> 02:47.535
Well, you're going to crack.

02:47.568 --> 02:50.304
Just like the rest
of your egghead friends!

02:53.974 --> 02:55.976
I'm so lonely.

02:56.009 --> 02:58.579
Be free, tiny bird.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.414
No birdie in this one.

03:00.448 --> 03:01.849
There's more in here, Star!

03:03.484 --> 03:04.618
-Be free!

03:04.652 --> 03:07.721
-Be free!
-Freedom!

03:19.667 --> 03:21.269
Stop!
You're destroying

03:21.302 --> 03:23.737
nature's best source
of protein and puns.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.975
Better safe than sorry.

03:28.008 --> 03:31.211
What's with
all the eggcitement?

03:33.881 --> 03:35.949
Raven, please,
I'm the egg pun guy.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.386
And what's happening
is Cyborg and Starfire

03:38.419 --> 03:40.588
are egging each other on.

03:40.621 --> 03:41.855
Well played.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.325
We are just having
the bird fun, Robin.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.859
And the breaking
stuff fun, too.

03:45.893 --> 03:48.529
Let us break
more of the objects.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.498
No!
-Too late!

04:10.651 --> 04:12.986
-Let's build a fort!

04:15.856 --> 04:17.891
-Star, we should
hang out more.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.593
ROBIN: Come on
out here, you two.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.329
(STARFIRE MUMBLING
INDISTINCTLY)

04:23.397 --> 04:26.066
STARFIRE AND CYBORG:
What is the password?

04:27.535 --> 04:28.702
Hmm.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.671
-Cucumber.
-CYBORG: Oh.

04:43.951 --> 04:44.852
Yes.

04:44.885 --> 04:47.555
We need to discuss
your recent behavior.

04:47.588 --> 04:48.822
Why? We're just having fun.

04:48.856 --> 04:51.725
Bro, you can't tell me
she's more fun than me!

04:51.759 --> 04:53.427
It's a different kind
of fun, Beasty.

04:53.461 --> 04:55.663
The innocent kind,
like when we were little kids.

04:55.696 --> 04:59.066
Back when you tried to find
the end of the rainbow,
or build a fort

04:59.099 --> 05:01.101
or just enjoy
some silly nursery rhymes

05:01.134 --> 05:03.904
like the one about
the old woman
who lives in the shoe.

05:03.937 --> 05:06.374
That rhyme is most wondrous.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.476
How big must the shoe be?

05:08.509 --> 05:10.544
And how stinky too.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.548
Stop acting like children!

05:14.582 --> 05:16.584
Is that wrong?

05:16.617 --> 05:19.387
You see, there's a reason
we leave childish things
like excessive exuberance,

05:19.420 --> 05:20.721
wonder, and innocence behind.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.623
What is it?

05:22.656 --> 05:23.957
I can't tell you.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.959
But if you don't heed
my warning,

05:25.993 --> 05:29.630
the consequences
will be highly eggstreme!

05:30.130 --> 05:31.331
Nice.

05:31.365 --> 05:34.535
But we like having
the exuberance of the child's,
Robin.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.836
That's right!

05:35.869 --> 05:37.104
Hey, you want to race
up and down the lawn?

05:37.137 --> 05:38.972
I do, indeed.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.409
No, I cannot allow
that to happen.

05:41.442 --> 05:42.676
Okay.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.378
But wait,
your shoes are untied!

05:44.412 --> 05:45.679
They are?

05:46.780 --> 05:48.716
Ah, I don't even have laces!

06:02.596 --> 06:06.700
I have not had this much fun
since I was little bungor.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.702
I feel like a kid again too.

06:08.736 --> 06:11.672
It makes you wonder
why people stop having
silly fun when they get older.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.006
It's crazy!

06:13.841 --> 06:14.908
What are you doing?

06:14.942 --> 06:17.010
Face paint, really?

06:17.044 --> 06:19.413
I know things
about face paint.

06:19.447 --> 06:22.115
It's dangerous.
I was a tiger once.

06:23.784 --> 06:26.687
Your faces!

06:26.720 --> 06:29.022
-See the...

06:29.056 --> 06:32.893
The features,
the bone structure,
everything looks...

06:32.926 --> 06:33.761
Younger!

06:33.794 --> 06:36.163
I believe
we appear the same, Robin.

06:36.196 --> 06:38.432
No, look at the differences
between Star now

06:38.466 --> 06:40.668
and a picture
I took of her eight hours ago.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.805
Now, the differences
with Cyborg are even
more pronounced.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.078
Look!

06:51.111 --> 06:53.881
-Look!
-Oh, Robin,
we are not younger.

06:53.914 --> 06:57.785
Can you not see
that we just bring out
the inner child in each other?

06:57.818 --> 06:59.487
We just feel younger.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.188
Now, we'd love to look at more
boring pictures with you,

07:01.221 --> 07:03.056
but we're going to go drink
from the hose.

07:03.090 --> 07:06.159
Hose water? Joy!

07:06.193 --> 07:08.729
You're absorbing each other's
childhood exuberance

07:08.762 --> 07:10.698
and it is literally
making you younger!

07:10.731 --> 07:12.199
You need to be isolated
so I can run some tests.

07:12.232 --> 07:14.668
You shall have
to catch us first.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.237
-Oh!
-CYBORG: I'm running.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.540
Stop having fun!

07:19.573 --> 07:20.808
What's going on?

07:20.841 --> 07:23.777
Yeah, all this noise
is eggravating me.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.779
-Boom!

07:25.813 --> 07:28.882
Starfire and Cyborg are toying
with forces they can't
possibly understand.

07:30.684 --> 07:32.886
It just looks like
they're playing
hide 'n' seek, dude.

07:32.920 --> 07:36.089
Eggactly!
That's how it's done!

07:36.123 --> 07:38.692
Unless we can stop them
from having innocent fun,

07:38.726 --> 07:40.494
they'll continue to de-age.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.611
What happened to them?

07:57.645 --> 08:00.848
They've been unborn.
You know what this means?

08:00.881 --> 08:02.983
Yes, more egg puns!

08:05.953 --> 08:08.589
Oh, snap.
It's the pickle bird.

08:08.622 --> 08:09.823
Got any pickles for me?

08:09.857 --> 08:11.291
That's not the pickle bird,
Beast Boy.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.227
Remember when you asked me
where babies come from?

08:14.261 --> 08:16.229
Oh, it's that bird!

08:16.263 --> 08:18.966
What up, Stork?
Got any babies for me?

08:18.999 --> 08:21.068
This is not a drop off, folks.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.871
This is a pick up.
I'm going to need
those eggs right there.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.673
-Thank you.

08:25.706 --> 08:29.610
Sorry, Stork.
But we don't serve
breakfast after eleven!

08:29.643 --> 08:30.911
Titans Go!

09:01.675 --> 09:02.943
Wait a second!

09:06.680 --> 09:07.915
Where's he going?

09:07.948 --> 09:10.083
A place of hope,
discovery and dreams.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.661
So, this is where
babies come from.

09:22.195 --> 09:25.833
Yes, and if we want to re-age
Cyborg and Starfire,

09:25.866 --> 09:27.300
we have to destroy it all!

09:39.747 --> 09:41.014
BEAST BOY: Cool!

09:41.048 --> 09:43.350
Look, Beast Boy's
starting to de-age too.

09:43.383 --> 09:44.151
We all are.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.353
The optimism here
is too strong!

09:46.386 --> 09:47.387
We have to act fast!

09:47.420 --> 09:48.922
Just look at this world

09:48.956 --> 09:51.391
through the eyes of an adult
with a mortgage.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.926
Right, Beast Boy?

09:52.960 --> 09:56.096
This shoe is so cool!

09:56.129 --> 09:58.365
Look how big those laces are!

09:58.398 --> 10:00.968
-Beast Boy, no!

10:01.001 --> 10:02.235
Ha, ha, ha!

10:02.269 --> 10:04.772
-We start acting our age.

10:04.805 --> 10:07.975
We have to remind ourselves
bugs are not fascinating.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.878
They're disgusting creatures.
Right, Raven?

10:10.911 --> 10:12.312
I forgot how neat bugs are.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.848
I want to study insects
when I grow up.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.186
Don't give up, Titans.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.854
We can still be sad,
lonely adults.

10:22.422 --> 10:23.857
Is that face paint?

10:23.891 --> 10:26.193
Must resist temptation.

10:26.226 --> 10:29.096
Colors, so bright.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.064
I want to be a tiger.

10:33.166 --> 10:36.236
Well, I wasn't
eggpecting this.

10:36.269 --> 10:39.039
You see that!
I'm the egg pun guy!
