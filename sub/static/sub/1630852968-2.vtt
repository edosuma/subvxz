you more than I owe?

39:27.933 --> 39:30.934
Thanks, but I've got
my own numbers game.

39:30.936 --> 39:32.402
Now if you wanna put yours
in for the next draw-

39:32.404 --> 39:33.836
You can bring bettors
in by the hundreds,

39:33.905 --> 39:35.371
But I can bring 'em
in by the thousands.

39:35.407 --> 39:36.672
Not in montreal you can't.

39:36.742 --> 39:39.142
Junior:
<i> I'm not talkin'</i>
<i> about a city.</i>

39:39.144 --> 39:40.810
I'm talking about
an entire network

39:40.945 --> 39:42.645
That plays both sides
of the borders.

39:46.918 --> 39:49.018
Let me use the trains
to run numbers for you.

39:50.255 --> 39:52.221
I'll triple your payback
inside a month.

39:53.692 --> 39:57.427
(in patois)<i> nothing permanent,</i>
<i>just a likkle pay and part ways.</i>

39:57.429 --> 39:58.561
You think I
need a partner?

39:58.597 --> 39:59.596
I think you need a man

39:59.598 --> 40:01.364
That knows every
vein of them trains.

40:02.734 --> 40:06.936
<i> And, I think if I gotta</i>
<i> spend the rest of my life</i>

40:06.972 --> 40:10.106
Bowing and smiling people
rather spit in my face

40:10.108 --> 40:11.774
Than see me as human,

40:11.843 --> 40:13.776
Then killing me
would be a kindness.

40:17.182 --> 40:19.048
And what would you do if
you were in my position,

40:19.184 --> 40:20.583
Mr. Massey?

40:25.991 --> 40:27.423
If I had what you got,

40:30.662 --> 40:31.928
I'd buy my son a piano

40:35.533 --> 40:37.766
So he wouldn't have to
play on a piece of wood.

40:40.672 --> 40:42.539
Hustler with a
heart of gold, huh?

40:42.674 --> 40:45.774
What's a heart if it's
not for your family?

40:45.811 --> 40:47.777
We can have anatomy
lesson another time,

40:47.779 --> 40:48.744
Today it's economics.

40:48.814 --> 40:49.812
Three hundred dollars today-

40:49.815 --> 40:51.280
I don't have it today.

40:52.350 --> 40:54.316
I'm pretty sure I won't
have it tomorrow.

40:55.821 --> 40:57.086
So if you ain't ready
to take this number-

40:57.088 --> 40:59.689
What makes you think that
you'd even make it to tomorrow?
