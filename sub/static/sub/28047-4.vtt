WEBVTT

00:08.040 --> 00:09.200
She gave up Steve.
Almost got him killed.

00:09.220 --> 00:11.220
I had no choice.
They had a gun

00:12.000 --> 00:15.040
-in my sister's face.
-One more slip, you're done.

00:15.060 --> 00:17.060
I'm sorry I got you involved
in all of this.

00:17.080 --> 00:20.010
But you gotta stay quiet.
Protect  us.

00:20.030 --> 00:22.050
We have a problem
with something Kraley's done.

00:22.070 --> 00:24.030
-Where is he?
-I don't know.

00:24.050 --> 00:25.180
If you find him, tell him
I'm lookin' for him too.

00:25.200 --> 00:27.010
No, you're gonna find him,

00:27.030 --> 00:28.200
and then you're gonna come back to me
and you're gonna let me know.

00:30.130 --> 00:32.180
Barry had a gun in his backpack.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.150
I know he made a bad decision, man,

00:34.170 --> 00:36.200
but if he gets a record,
he's gonna lose that scholarship.

00:36.220 --> 00:39.180
Every time I look at you,
you wanna know what I see?

00:39.200 --> 00:41.000
You're so-called father.

00:41.020 --> 00:43.080
We're petitioning sole custody
of Veronica.

00:43.100 --> 00:45.080
and  we'll win.

00:45.100 --> 00:46.230
I'll need at least $30,000
as a retainer.

00:47.010 --> 00:49.060
I don't have that kind of money right now.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.030
Them I'm not interested
in the case.

00:51.050 --> 00:54.000
There's a turf war brewing, ya know?
Innocent people are gon' get hurt.

00:54.020 --> 00:55.050
I'm makin' moves.

00:55.070 --> 00:58.120
You want a street war, huh?
Because that's on you.

00:58.140 --> 00:59.190
Then buckle up.

00:59.210 --> 01:01.140
You get me out from
underneath these charges,

01:01.160 --> 01:04.060
otherwise I am taking
every one of you down with me.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.090
You agree to stonewall
the Police Commission--

01:06.110 --> 01:07.180
don't tell 'em a damn thing.

01:07.200 --> 01:10.000
You gonna answer any of our questions
here today?

01:10.020 --> 01:11.020
No.

01:11.040 --> 01:13.190
Your brother has no intention
of gettin' your father back alive.

01:13.210 --> 01:15.150
If he's not already dead, he's gonna be

01:15.170 --> 01:17.160
unless you can get your brother
to pump the brakes.

01:18.130 --> 01:19.180
Drop it!

01:44.210 --> 01:46.030
Shots fired! Shots fired!

02:05.110 --> 02:06.200
You had to, man.

02:08.180 --> 02:12.040
It was either him or us.

02:15.150 --> 02:17.080
There were two of 'em--

02:17.100 --> 02:18.170
both armed.

02:18.190 --> 02:20.060
They were curb servers.

02:20.080 --> 02:22.080
They dropped the dope and took off
the second we pulled up.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.080
- They shot at us first.
- Yeah?

02:25.230 --> 02:27.070
Yeah.

02:29.030 --> 02:32.010
Ya got anything?

02:32.030 --> 02:34.010
Exit wound in the chest.

02:34.030 --> 02:35.230
-You sure it's exit?
-Yeah.

02:36.010 --> 02:37.230
It's at a slight angle,
so it looks like

02:38.010 --> 02:39.090
he could have been spinning on 'em.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.020
You ready to turn him over?

02:46.230 --> 02:48.040
Shit.

02:53.070 --> 02:56.000
He had a gun. I swear.

02:56.020 --> 02:57.100
We were chasing the second shooter.

02:57.120 --> 02:59.010
Someone from the neighborhood
must have taken it.

02:59.030 --> 03:01.080
-He was shot in the back.
-Yeah. He was running away,

03:01.100 --> 03:02.200
but he was shooting back at us,
like this.

03:02.220 --> 03:04.070
-Right?
-Right.

03:07.180 --> 03:08.230
You're Hammond's kid, right?

03:11.150 --> 03:14.050
-Yes, sir.
-All right, that changes things.

03:14.070 --> 03:17.030
We'll straighten it out.
Means we're family.

03:18.030 --> 03:19.110
Are you a Raven?

04:06.040 --> 04:07.080
Papa?

04:33.070 --> 04:35.000
Thank you for helping me with this.

04:37.170 --> 04:39.070
Come see me tomorrow afternoon.

04:39.090 --> 04:41.190
We will settle
whatever debt we owe you.

04:48.020 --> 04:50.090
What my brother just said
is that you are owed nothing.

04:53.110 --> 04:56.010
Lucky for you, he no longer
has any say in those things.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.230
Five million.

05:21.010 --> 05:23.010
All the money in the world
is not gonna mean much

05:23.030 --> 05:25.040
if Steve can't get us away
from the cartel.

05:25.220 --> 05:29.140
Once they pay us, screw 'em.
We don't need anything from them.

05:29.160 --> 05:32.130
-Yeah, I hope it's that easy.
-Yeah.

05:38.230 --> 05:41.110
See any resemblance
between me and this guy?

05:41.130 --> 05:43.060
All units stand by for emergent traffic.

05:43.080 --> 05:46.140
Unit 32-Adam, you have the handle,
32-Boy, you have the assist

05:46.160 --> 05:48.200
regarding gunshot victims
at Harbor General.

05:48.220 --> 05:50.230
RP says it appears to be gang-related.

05:51.010 --> 05:52.060
Victims?

05:53.040 --> 05:54.220
32-Adam copy. En route.

05:56.040 --> 05:58.130
We're gonna be buried in paper
the rest of the shift.

05:58.150 --> 06:00.120
Yeah.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.070
-What?
-You got the assist.

06:05.090 --> 06:07.210
Let's go! Come on, Beach.

06:07.230 --> 06:09.040
I gotta go handle something.

06:09.060 --> 06:10.150
-Be there in 20.
-All right.

06:29.140 --> 06:32.150
Someone drops a bomb on this place,
crime rate on two continents drops.

06:33.230 --> 06:36.110
My gut's tellin' me
this isn't a place we should be, Steve.

06:36.130 --> 06:37.160
Ya feel me?

06:40.170 --> 06:42.170
We're here to get paid, Pete.

06:42.190 --> 06:44.030
When we do, we're out.

06:46.160 --> 06:49.100
Have you come to terms
with our plans for Veronica?

06:51.100 --> 06:52.210
Amigos.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.180
Do the right thing.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.040
Where's Ricardo?

07:12.060 --> 07:13.070
Salud.

07:13.090 --> 07:14.150
Salud.

07:14.170 --> 07:17.070
No idea.
Maybe he didn't get an invite.

07:21.010 --> 07:23.000
What's the point of us being here?

07:23.020 --> 07:25.200
-Why let us see all this?
-He thinks we're greedy...

07:25.220 --> 07:27.140
and it'll suck us in deeper.

07:33.010 --> 07:35.150
You two. Come with me.

07:35.170 --> 07:37.160
I want to introduce you
to some friends.

07:38.160 --> 07:40.150
Come.

07:48.090 --> 07:50.110
Yeah.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.040
Come on in.
I called that reporter

07:56.060 --> 07:57.150
and told him
he couldn't use what I said,

07:57.170 --> 07:59.220
-so don't start.
-Is this him?

08:02.140 --> 08:06.110
Is this him? The sperm donor.
My so-called father.

08:19.160 --> 08:22.060
- Can you hear me?
- It's not stopping.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.170
-Lenhart, how many victims?
-Three.

08:29.190 --> 08:31.130
One DOA. Two not lookin' so good.

08:31.150 --> 08:33.160
If you're here to take statements,
you'll be waitin' a while.

09:08.070 --> 09:10.200
I know you're upset, Amber.

09:10.220 --> 09:13.130
I need to find out what out happened
before I can do anything--

09:13.150 --> 09:15.040
Fourteen.

09:15.220 --> 09:17.190
She was fourteen.

09:19.090 --> 09:20.130
Do you wanna tell me  again

09:20.150 --> 09:23.080
how you and the other cops
are doing all you can?

09:27.160 --> 09:30.000
She was just a kid, Cole.

09:31.200 --> 09:35.000
Look, I've got people to help...

09:35.020 --> 09:38.050
so get out there
and go do your job.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.070
Go be a cop.

10:09.070 --> 10:11.050
We're gettin' paid or not?

10:11.070 --> 10:12.140
Tranquilo.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.050
What my father says
that we owe you.

10:23.110 --> 10:25.050
This?

10:25.070 --> 10:28.060
-This is not five million.
-No.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.130
Two hundred thousand.

10:29.150 --> 10:31.000
Kraley cost you the rest

10:31.020 --> 10:32.100
when he sent that cop
to rob our money house.

10:32.120 --> 10:36.050
-He had nothin' to do with that.
-Of course he did.

10:36.070 --> 10:40.170
And this money is the only reason
he can show his face without being killed.

10:40.190 --> 10:43.080
Just be glad that this
is the only punishment.

10:43.100 --> 10:47.100
Deal was, we get Ignacio back,
you pay us, we're done.

10:47.120 --> 10:50.090
That was then.
The circumstances changed

10:50.110 --> 10:53.110
when my father heard from Ricardo
about Kraley's betrayal.

10:56.040 --> 10:57.110
Look,

10:57.130 --> 11:00.130
I know that this isn't right.
And because of it,

11:00.150 --> 11:03.130
-I wanna make it up to you.
-How?

11:04.200 --> 11:05.230
Work for me.

11:07.220 --> 11:09.130
In a more legitimate way.

11:21.190 --> 11:24.120
Hey, you paid for all that?
Or was it donated?

11:26.190 --> 11:27.200
You need somethin'?

11:28.180 --> 11:31.100
G's makin' moves
and I'm losin' runners.

11:31.120 --> 11:34.060
And I can't do nothin' about it
'cause the Vipers got him covered.

11:34.080 --> 11:37.010
So tell me, man. What am I gonna
have to pay to get you and your people

11:37.030 --> 11:39.180
-to do the same for me?
-I don't know what you're talkin' about.

11:39.200 --> 11:42.180
-People gettin' killed, Cole.
-That's because you killin' 'em.

11:42.200 --> 11:46.040
I'm just defending my corners, man.
G ridin' on  us.

11:46.060 --> 11:48.170
Get rid of his ass,
keep the peace.

11:48.190 --> 11:50.080
-Take a walk.
-Come on, man.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.180
Take a walk.

11:56.130 --> 11:58.180
A'ight, man. A'ight.

12:16.090 --> 12:17.090
To hell with that!

12:17.110 --> 12:18.230
Both of you shut up
and let him talk.

12:19.010 --> 12:21.220
-You haven't even been here!
-Cole's right, this is bullshit, Steve!

12:22.000 --> 12:23.030
What's goin' on?

12:23.050 --> 12:24.220
Kraley here decided
to crawl out from under his rock.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.100
They played us
because they think we're weak.

12:27.120 --> 12:28.200
I'm not steppin' down.

12:28.220 --> 12:31.230
We both know why they played us,
and it ain't about being weak.

12:32.010 --> 12:34.090
- You're lucky Beach doesn't know.
- Yeah, back off.

12:34.110 --> 12:37.060
-'Cause you don't do shit but complain!
-Shut up, son!

12:37.080 --> 12:38.180
Men are talkin' here!

12:38.200 --> 12:40.090
Hear him out before you go off at him!

12:43.230 --> 12:47.150
I don't like it any more than you do,
but they are blaming us

12:47.170 --> 12:49.020
for what Foster did.

12:50.090 --> 12:53.000
All we can do is salvage what we can.

12:53.020 --> 12:55.010
How you gonna salvage shit?

12:55.030 --> 12:56.230
I got some options for that.

12:57.010 --> 12:59.040
He's got an option.

12:59.060 --> 13:02.020
-Let's not forget who's in charge here.
-You wanna hear 'em, or not?

13:04.230 --> 13:09.000
We're under a ton of pressure right now,
so our best bet is to go legit.

13:10.050 --> 13:12.150
-This shit again.
-Let me finish!

13:13.200 --> 13:17.100
I get we need to keep earning,
so we're setting up a security business.

13:17.120 --> 13:18.200
You bein' serious?

13:18.220 --> 13:21.060
It pays good and we already have a client
with multiple sites.

13:21.080 --> 13:23.200
Takes time to set up a business.
We got bills  now.

13:23.220 --> 13:26.130
Yeah, we have a backer
who will front the start-up costs.

13:26.150 --> 13:29.080
-Who?
-The cartel.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.200
They have legitimate operations
all over the country.

13:31.220 --> 13:35.000
They're our initial clients,
then we will expand the customer base.

13:36.020 --> 13:38.070
This is the first time
me hearin' this too,

13:38.090 --> 13:39.130
but it sounds good to me.

13:40.190 --> 13:44.020
What? You idiots want to keep
shakin' down curb servers

13:44.040 --> 13:47.020
and protecting gangbangers
when we can earn legal money?

13:48.010 --> 13:49.140
How much we talkin' about, Steve?

13:49.160 --> 13:50.200
Forty an hour.

13:52.090 --> 13:54.180
Do as little as ten hours a week,

13:54.200 --> 13:57.080
that's an extra 20 grand a year.

13:58.150 --> 14:00.200
Think about it.

14:03.030 --> 14:05.010
What, we're rent-a-cops
to the cartel now?

14:05.030 --> 14:07.030
Cartel's temporary.
The business is permanent.

14:07.050 --> 14:10.040
What about Price?
The Police Commission?

14:10.060 --> 14:11.190
That ain't the way it happened.

14:11.210 --> 14:14.190
Your daddy never jumped
in front of a gun to save his partner.

14:14.210 --> 14:17.010
He got a commendation for it.

14:17.030 --> 14:19.200
Your old man had a big ol' line
of bullshit, that's what he had.

14:19.220 --> 14:24.040
And at the end of the day,
we got tired of listenin' to it.

14:24.060 --> 14:26.080
That's why he turned to the bottle.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.150
One of you stop that
before she kills him.

14:42.170 --> 14:44.220
-Young crowd.
-Always.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.150
University's across the street.

14:46.170 --> 14:48.150
I'm guessin' you sell
more booze than food then, huh?

14:48.170 --> 14:50.000
Pretty much.

14:50.160 --> 14:54.020
That old guy over there.
Seems a little out of place.

14:54.040 --> 14:56.000
Nah, he's a professor.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.080
He comes in with the students a lot.
They seem to like him.

15:11.060 --> 15:13.020
It's the cartel
we're talkin' about here.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.080
Yeah.

15:14.100 --> 15:18.020
But Carmen's got legitimate
development and construction sites.

15:19.110 --> 15:20.210
They're just a front, right?

15:21.200 --> 15:25.070
Of course they are,
but it gives us a base we can build on--

15:25.090 --> 15:27.010
land some real clients,

15:27.030 --> 15:29.100
and then cut loose
from the cartel.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.020
It's a damn good payday for you.

15:32.200 --> 15:35.070
I gotta run the bar.
I don't want any part of it.

15:35.090 --> 15:37.020
-Meadow can run the bar.
-Really--

15:37.040 --> 15:38.200
Before you say no, hear me out.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.230
You'll have complete control.

15:42.010 --> 15:43.170
You don't like somethin',
we don't do it.

15:44.210 --> 15:46.180
And I need you
as the face of this business, Carl,

15:46.200 --> 15:49.170
'cause I can't get out
from under this shit without you.

15:53.100 --> 15:55.160
And when you do,
I'm left with the company?

15:55.180 --> 15:58.140
No. At that point I want to run it.

15:59.140 --> 16:03.000
But the only kind of luck I had lately
is the bad kind. It's time I got out.

16:26.020 --> 16:27.090
Congratulations.

16:27.110 --> 16:29.090
About what?

16:29.110 --> 16:31.220
This is all I've got left.
My whole life, right here.

16:33.030 --> 16:34.090
You're free.

16:35.070 --> 16:37.130
Thanks to the intel
I helped you feed the DEA.

16:39.060 --> 16:40.120
You're welcome.

16:43.120 --> 16:46.020
I'm not going anywhere with you.

16:46.040 --> 16:48.190
Yeah, you are. Get in.

17:08.120 --> 17:10.130
Steve says that you can be an asset.

17:12.050 --> 17:13.230
I'm not so sure.

17:18.090 --> 17:20.200
- What's in it for me?
- Nothing.

17:20.220 --> 17:23.000
Unless I see your value.

17:24.220 --> 17:26.100
I have inside knowledge.

17:26.120 --> 17:30.080
Investigative techniques,
names and locations of informers

17:30.100 --> 17:32.100
and undercover agents.

17:33.070 --> 17:36.030
Any friends left at the DEA
and the FBI?

17:37.150 --> 17:39.190
If they're properly incentivized.

17:39.210 --> 17:43.000
And you're willing to share information
with my father?

17:43.020 --> 17:44.170
On an going basis?

17:44.190 --> 17:47.010
If  I'm  properly incentivized.

17:50.110 --> 17:54.230
Do you understand that
a relationship with us...

17:57.080 --> 17:59.020
...it's a one-way street.

17:59.040 --> 18:01.060
There's no goin' back.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.140
This isn't my first rodeo.

18:07.070 --> 18:09.070
Could you give us a moment, please...

18:09.090 --> 18:11.090
so that I can talk to Steve in private?

18:13.160 --> 18:14.230
Thank you.

18:21.020 --> 18:25.050
So she's your enemy first,
and you bring her to me now. Why?

18:27.150 --> 18:31.210
Because she's still a danger to me
if she's out there, and hungry.

18:31.230 --> 18:34.170
But if she's working for you,

18:34.190 --> 18:36.170
I know exactly where she is.

18:36.190 --> 18:39.120
So you don't trust her...

18:39.140 --> 18:41.140
but you expect me to?

18:41.160 --> 18:44.210
Because like everyone
you deal with, she's greedy.

18:44.230 --> 18:46.090
Not stupid.

18:49.220 --> 18:51.140
If we agree to do this, Steve,

18:51.160 --> 18:54.050
you understand that
she's your responsibility.

19:13.180 --> 19:15.150
I gotta step away, Steve.

19:17.140 --> 19:20.030
I'm putting in for a transfer.

19:20.050 --> 19:23.050
It's the only chance I got
of keeping contact with my daughter,

19:23.070 --> 19:24.220
is to step off this rollercoaster.

19:27.210 --> 19:30.120
Victor works for the cartel, right?

19:30.140 --> 19:34.100
What if we get Ignacio to lean on him
about the custody arrangement?

19:34.120 --> 19:36.010
Jesus.

19:36.030 --> 19:37.070
What's up, Pearl?

19:37.090 --> 19:38.200
You know I hate to bother you, Pete,

19:38.220 --> 19:42.020
but I really thought you should know
there's a strange man at your house,

19:42.040 --> 19:45.080
-and he's carrying out boxes--
-I'm on my way!

19:46.210 --> 19:48.090
Shit.

19:58.010 --> 19:59.180
What's goin' on?

19:59.200 --> 20:01.230
This is my house too.
There's stuff I need.

20:02.010 --> 20:03.210
Well, you coulda called
and at least let me know.

20:03.230 --> 20:05.180
I don't answer to you
or your schedule.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.210
Why don't you leave

20:06.230 --> 20:08.060
and let us finish doing this?

20:08.080 --> 20:09.170
If you're trying to push his buttons,

20:09.190 --> 20:11.210
know if he goes, I go too.

20:13.050 --> 20:16.040
I'm doing everything I can
to show you that I care.

20:16.060 --> 20:17.170
Yeah, too little, too late.

20:17.190 --> 20:20.100
-What, does he talk for you now?
-Can we all stop?

20:21.090 --> 20:22.190
I just need to get some stuff.

20:27.090 --> 20:29.090
Leave it, Pete.

21:00.070 --> 21:03.130
Perhaps I could recommend the Honda
for propping yourself up?

21:03.150 --> 21:05.090
This is about to be unavailable.

21:05.110 --> 21:09.060
-You Professor Michael Everett?
-Last I checked. May I?

21:09.080 --> 21:11.070
Name Abigail Beach
mean anything to you?

21:12.230 --> 21:15.140
No. Do you mind?

21:17.010 --> 21:19.000
She says you raped her.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.090
Thirty years ago, so don't worry.

21:23.110 --> 21:25.110
The statute expired a long time ago.

21:25.130 --> 21:26.210
Then what do you want?

21:28.010 --> 21:30.050
For you to tell me
whether my mother lied to me.

21:32.060 --> 21:33.160
Did you rape her?

21:33.180 --> 21:36.170
I-I never raped anybody.

21:37.160 --> 21:40.170
I don't remember anybody named Beach
from 30 years ago.

21:40.190 --> 21:43.020
Is this some kind of shakedown?

21:49.120 --> 21:52.010
That's my cell and address
on the back.

21:52.030 --> 21:55.060
You decide you want to talk about it,
get in touch.

21:57.020 --> 21:59.170
But I'm not letting this go
until I know the truth.

22:07.020 --> 22:09.060
Your paperwork is incomplete.

22:09.080 --> 22:12.190
I recommend you speak to an attorney
before we proceed.

22:15.010 --> 22:17.090
I'm willing to allow supervised visits.

22:17.110 --> 22:21.040
I mean, on the condition
that I set the times.

22:22.130 --> 22:24.230
-What the hell happened to you?
-Excuse me?

22:25.010 --> 22:27.100
You used to think for yourself,
now he does it for you?

22:31.150 --> 22:33.180
I'm done with this mediation shit.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.160
I'm filing for full custody.

22:36.180 --> 22:39.030
You don't want to push this to trial.

22:39.050 --> 22:41.100
Dragging this out
will only hurt Veronica.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.160
More than never seeing her father again?

22:44.180 --> 22:47.180
You'll be lucky not to see
the inside of a cell...

22:48.190 --> 22:52.100
...after the judge hears about
all the dirt in your life.

22:55.120 --> 22:57.030
Go ahead.

22:57.050 --> 22:58.210
Burn my house down, Victor.

23:01.020 --> 23:03.000
And I'll burn down yours.

23:03.020 --> 23:06.050
-You're just as dirty as I am.
-Pete.

23:06.070 --> 23:08.150
Remember, we have the same employer.

23:09.200 --> 23:11.000
So come after me.

23:11.020 --> 23:13.000
And  you  can explain to Carmen

23:13.020 --> 23:15.160
why you're slinging shit
that's gonna blow back on her.

23:40.180 --> 23:42.050
Hey.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.100
You guys are killin' me here.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.170
Quit your whining, Carl.

23:49.020 --> 23:50.040
The place is good.

23:52.040 --> 23:53.100
Legit.

23:53.120 --> 23:55.190
I'm not complaining about the office.

23:55.210 --> 23:57.070
What's the problem?

23:57.090 --> 23:59.220
It's the first day
and already we got no-shows.

24:01.020 --> 24:04.070
Who didn't show up?

24:12.190 --> 24:14.050
You didn't show for your shift.

24:14.070 --> 24:16.220
You gotta be reliable
or we lose the jobs.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.210
Babysitter canceled on me.
Last minute.

24:22.110 --> 24:23.160
This is my sister.

24:23.180 --> 24:26.050
-Dani.
-Hi, Dani.

24:30.140 --> 24:32.210
After what happened,
I just can't leave her.

24:37.070 --> 24:40.150
You shoulda had a backup plan.
I'm taking you off the roster.

24:40.170 --> 24:43.060
She's still so terrified.

24:43.080 --> 24:46.000
Those cartel goons
scared the shit out of her.

24:46.020 --> 24:49.140
I need the money.
It won't happen again. Please!

24:58.180 --> 24:59.220
You're quiet.

25:01.150 --> 25:04.020
It's 'cause I don't like
working two-man cars.

25:04.040 --> 25:05.210
And I hate talkin' to you.

25:09.200 --> 25:12.140
Then let's start shakin' some shit.

25:12.160 --> 25:16.020
'Cause right now it feels like I'm trapped
in the Uber ride from hell.

25:16.040 --> 25:18.080
Fine. You wanna know
what I'm thinkin' about?

25:20.010 --> 25:21.220
I found my biological father.

25:22.190 --> 25:24.100
You're screwin' with me, right?

25:27.040 --> 25:28.160
Am I allowed to ask about it?

25:28.180 --> 25:30.010
No.

25:31.070 --> 25:32.200
I'm gonna anyway.

25:43.170 --> 25:45.100
It's G! Run!

25:58.050 --> 25:59.090
Shit!

26:00.210 --> 26:02.150
Cole!

26:02.170 --> 26:06.100
32-Adam is requesting backup
and rescue unit on a 245 now.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.100
Shit.

26:18.170 --> 26:20.050
What the hell?

26:21.180 --> 26:23.180
I know this kid.

26:23.200 --> 26:26.090
He was a good kid, man.

26:41.060 --> 26:44.040
Someone saw the shooter.
It was G.

26:45.140 --> 26:47.120
Now you gonna do your damn job?

26:49.070 --> 26:51.110
They gonna testify to that?

26:55.020 --> 26:56.140
Probably not.

26:57.200 --> 26:59.150
But you were there. You saw it.

27:02.030 --> 27:04.130
We didn't get close enough for an I.D.

27:13.030 --> 27:14.190
That woman worked three jobs,

27:14.210 --> 27:17.130
and still had time
to put this kid on the right path.

27:17.150 --> 27:20.040
And now everything she did,
everything he did, to get away from this,

27:20.060 --> 27:21.210
was for nothin'.

27:30.060 --> 27:33.100
You gotta take this shit seriously
if it's gonna work for us.

27:33.120 --> 27:35.200
You gotta show up for your shifts!

27:35.220 --> 27:38.100
Sittin' around a construction site
for hours, it's  boring.

27:38.120 --> 27:39.150
It's good money.

27:39.170 --> 27:41.090
Maybe for you it is.

27:42.110 --> 27:43.230
How much is goin' in
your own pocket?

27:44.010 --> 27:46.080
He ain't takin' anything for himself.

27:46.100 --> 27:49.220
Ten percent goes into the pension,
the rest goes to the Ravens

27:50.000 --> 27:52.110
who actually show up for their shifts!

27:52.130 --> 27:55.080
It comes out to forty an hour for you--
what's the problem?

27:55.100 --> 27:56.190
All he does is judge.

27:56.210 --> 27:59.230
-Jesus.
-That's not a leader in my book!

28:01.070 --> 28:04.060
Every day I reach out to Tom,
begging him to come back,

28:04.080 --> 28:05.140
but he won't!

28:05.160 --> 28:09.070
Not while  he's  still criticizing
his every move.

28:09.090 --> 28:12.140
He ain't here because he don't care
about anybody but himself!

28:16.030 --> 28:17.230
This is what's in the pension right now.

28:18.010 --> 28:21.020
I'm gonna split it evenly
between every Raven.

28:22.180 --> 28:25.080
That's a starting bonus
for every Raven

28:25.100 --> 28:29.020
who wants to buy into
the security business...

28:29.040 --> 28:30.210
and do the job.

28:34.190 --> 28:36.100
Anybody want out?

28:38.010 --> 28:40.050
Make a decision now,
'cause after tonight

28:40.070 --> 28:41.180
I don't wanna hear
any more complaints

28:41.200 --> 28:43.090
about how I run this program.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.170
Carve it up, Pete.

28:53.170 --> 28:55.010
Sit down.

29:11.220 --> 29:13.030
Phone.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.230
Yeah.

29:16.010 --> 29:17.150
Answer it or shut it off.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.230
You gonna finish that bottle, too?

29:26.010 --> 29:27.120
Maybe.

29:28.060 --> 29:30.020
Maybe that'll help.

29:32.050 --> 29:35.160
Most people drink themselves stupid,
but being how you started that way...

29:37.120 --> 29:40.100
What do you mean? She's a Raven.
She deserves her piece.

29:40.120 --> 29:43.080
She almost got me killed
by running her mouth.

29:44.210 --> 29:48.040
She'll get it--
when she proves she deserves it.

30:08.030 --> 30:10.010
Christine! Hold up.

30:11.090 --> 30:12.140
Hey.

30:14.060 --> 30:15.230
Thank you for trying.

30:17.160 --> 30:18.230
Look.

30:20.040 --> 30:21.120
That's half my cut.

30:22.100 --> 30:23.210
Just take it.

30:27.190 --> 30:29.090
Steve has to be able to trust you.

30:29.110 --> 30:30.160
We all do.

30:31.150 --> 30:33.050
That's how it works.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
Thank you.

30:38.020 --> 30:39.220
You got it.

31:26.120 --> 31:28.090
Left you five messages.

31:28.110 --> 31:30.020
Ya ever answer your phone?

31:35.020 --> 31:36.200
Did you see him?

31:36.220 --> 31:38.030
Yeah.

31:39.120 --> 31:41.100
Did you kill him?

31:41.120 --> 31:43.040
Was I supposed to?

31:43.220 --> 31:45.010
Want a drink?

31:45.030 --> 31:47.190
You're not still drinkin'
that wine cooler shit, are ya?

31:48.200 --> 31:50.030
Not since I was 15.

32:01.100 --> 32:03.000
He doesn't remember you.

32:03.020 --> 32:07.100
And obviously, he says he's never
raped anyone in his entire life.

32:10.060 --> 32:13.120
So he doesn't believe you...

32:14.080 --> 32:15.200
...that you're his spawn.

32:19.230 --> 32:21.210
Christ.

32:21.230 --> 32:24.120
-You believed  him?
-One of you is lying.

32:25.070 --> 32:28.140
Wake the hell up, or get out.

32:28.160 --> 32:30.230
'Cause I'm not the one who's lying.

33:01.180 --> 33:04.020
All right.
Roll your ass out.

33:04.040 --> 33:06.110
We're closing.

33:06.130 --> 33:08.020
You've had enough. Be safe.

33:35.110 --> 33:36.110
Put your hands up, G.

33:36.130 --> 33:39.060
Come on.
You lost your damn mind?

33:39.080 --> 33:42.150
-He's drunk.
-I am. So try me!

33:42.170 --> 33:43.200
-So you takin' me in?
-Yeah.

33:43.220 --> 33:46.090
And  you  need to walk,
or you're comin' with.

33:46.110 --> 33:47.200
-Walk!
-It's good.

33:47.220 --> 33:49.120
Call my damn lawyer.

33:49.140 --> 33:50.180
Put your hands up. Come on.

33:50.200 --> 33:52.000
Get up against the car. Come on.

33:56.170 --> 33:58.020
What's the charge?

33:58.040 --> 34:01.030
-I'll think of somethin'. Come on.
-Gonna be sorry

34:01.050 --> 34:04.010
-when you're sobered up.
-Whatever. Come on.

34:04.160 --> 34:05.220
In you go.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.130
Look, this is just one more example

34:10.150 --> 34:13.040
of how out-of-hand
the media has become and--

34:13.060 --> 34:15.170
and no offense to those of you
who are here today.

34:15.190 --> 34:18.130
But I think there's one thing
we can all agree on:

34:18.150 --> 34:22.090
there's been an enormous lack
of journalistic integrity here.

34:22.110 --> 34:25.120
The author of this article
promised to expose

34:25.140 --> 34:27.140
gross corruption in the department,

34:27.160 --> 34:29.020
and then failed to deliver.

34:29.040 --> 34:32.000
His sources have retracted
their statements,

34:32.020 --> 34:36.100
and much of what the article offers
is speculative, anyway.

34:36.120 --> 34:38.230
The department
did its own investigation

34:39.010 --> 34:44.070
and found these broad accusations
to be... without merit.

34:44.090 --> 34:47.000
These are just social clubs...

34:47.020 --> 34:50.230
a part of the station pride,
if you will.

34:51.010 --> 34:55.140
No different than, say, a marine
getting a USMC tattoo.

34:55.160 --> 34:57.130
All right, drinks on the house!

35:18.100 --> 35:19.180
Uh, no thanks.

35:20.170 --> 35:22.210
Any more and I might take  you  home.

35:22.230 --> 35:24.200
Do you even know where home is?

35:25.200 --> 35:27.060
Funny.

35:27.080 --> 35:28.200
It's from her.

35:36.080 --> 35:39.010
-Hey. Thanks.
-Yeah.

35:43.120 --> 35:46.050
-How old's your daughter?
-Ten.

35:47.060 --> 35:49.210
Maybe she and Dani
can have a playdate.

35:49.230 --> 35:51.190
Yeah.

35:52.190 --> 35:54.140
She ever talk to you about boys?

35:55.230 --> 35:58.230
Look, I don't mean to be rude
or anything, but, um...

35:59.010 --> 36:01.130
I'm kinda alone for a reason.

36:03.170 --> 36:05.050
No shit.

36:15.110 --> 36:18.040
Tell me what you got. Are you in?

36:19.000 --> 36:20.110
Yeah.

36:20.130 --> 36:22.020
They trust you yet?

36:22.040 --> 36:24.100
They don't even trust each other.

36:24.120 --> 36:26.230
But you laid eyes on Ignacio.

36:28.030 --> 36:29.110
No, just the daughter.

36:29.130 --> 36:31.000
So where is he?

36:31.020 --> 36:34.080
They haven't shared that with me yet.

36:34.100 --> 36:36.150
It's about time
I meet these people myself.

36:36.170 --> 36:39.160
Start layin' track for an intro.

37:08.120 --> 37:12.190
I know we're blockin' traffic,
but these people need to mourn.

37:12.210 --> 37:16.060
I'm here to pay my respects
like everybody else, brother.

37:22.110 --> 37:24.100
Damn it, I asked him not to come.

37:25.150 --> 37:27.030
I'll handle it.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.170
Now's not a good time
for you to be here.

37:34.190 --> 37:36.220
Man, just 'cause we sling
don't mean we don't give a shit

37:37.000 --> 37:38.100
about what happens
in our neighborhood.

37:38.120 --> 37:41.120
Do you see these people?
They're mourning.

37:41.140 --> 37:44.040
And right now, you're just a reminder
why all this shit happened.

37:48.050 --> 37:50.100
Yeah. Yeah, I feel ya.

37:51.050 --> 37:52.070
Look, man, just...

37:52.090 --> 37:55.210
tell the pastor that
I'll pay for the burial expenses.

37:55.230 --> 37:57.040
It's the least I can do.

37:58.040 --> 37:59.100
I'll let him know.

38:02.100 --> 38:03.220
Heard G got arrested.

38:05.210 --> 38:07.070
Yeah.

40:08.190 --> 40:11.030
See, this is why
we can't have nice things.

40:14.010 --> 40:16.010
Son of a bitch.

40:39.170 --> 40:41.170
I hear you like to talk.

40:48.020 --> 40:49.190
So let's talk.
