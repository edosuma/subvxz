01:31.826 --> 01:34.693
(ominous music)

01:48.442 --> 01:49.775
- What kinda medication?

01:49.777 --> 01:51.143
- Prozac.

01:51.144 --> 01:52.510
- What?
- Prozac.

01:52.511 --> 01:53.877
- No, I heard you
the first time.

01:53.878 --> 01:55.244
Why the hell do you
wanna give me Prozac?

01:55.249 --> 01:56.882
- It'll stabilize your mood
and make you feel better.

01:56.884 --> 01:59.118
- Well, how's it gonna do that?

01:59.120 --> 02:01.787
- It prevents the reuptake
of serotonin in your brain,

02:01.789 --> 02:05.657
so serotonin levels rise, and
that tends to stabilize mood.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.543
That's how that works.
- Oh, for Christ sakes.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.428
Nothing can be easy with
you shrinks, can it?

02:10.331 --> 02:11.897
- Look--
- You know what?

02:11.899 --> 02:15.200
People come in here and
they spend, what, $200

02:15.202 --> 02:16.502
thinking that
you're gonna unlock

02:16.503 --> 02:17.803
some superpower in their soul

02:17.805 --> 02:19.872
so they can go home and
fuck their wives better

02:19.874 --> 02:21.740
or discover some new courage

02:21.742 --> 02:24.143
to finally admit to
themselves that they're gay.

02:24.145 --> 02:25.911
Or maybe, how about this one,

02:25.912 --> 02:27.678
stop draining their husband's
bank account based on the fact

02:27.681 --> 02:29.748
that they think
that he's fucking

02:29.749 --> 02:31.816
probably one of your other
clients, and what do you do?

02:31.819 --> 02:33.719
You prescribe them some pills?

02:33.721 --> 02:34.934
Ha!

02:34.935 --> 02:36.148
You know what that's called?

02:36.149 --> 02:37.362
That's called a racket.

02:37.363 --> 02:38.576
- I beg your pardon.

02:38.577 --> 02:39.790
- No, I should be begging
you for 200 bucks back!

02:39.793 --> 02:41.660
Christ on a cross.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.795
Thank god there's no
problems with my, (pausing)

02:43.797 --> 02:46.131
you know.

02:46.132 --> 02:48.466
Lord knows what kinda pills
you'd wanna give me for that.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.636
- Mr. Rome.
- Mickey.

02:50.638 --> 02:51.637
- Mickey.

02:53.174 --> 02:55.440
I have asked you numerous times

02:55.442 --> 02:57.576
what it is you do for a living

02:57.577 --> 02:59.711
that's causing so
much of this anxiety.

02:59.713 --> 03:02.531
- I already told you.

03:02.532 --> 03:05.350
- You told me that you
occasionally transport things.

03:05.352 --> 03:06.718
- Yeah, yeah,
something like that.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.670
- Something like what?

03:08.671 --> 03:10.621
- You know, I take things
from one place to the next.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.324
I (pausing) protect stuff.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.293
- You protect stuff.
- Sure.

03:15.496 --> 03:16.679
- Uh-huh.

03:16.680 --> 03:17.863
Give me an example.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.598
- I can't do that. (laughing)
- Why not?

03:19.600 --> 03:21.466
- Doc, you can't
ask me questions.

03:21.468 --> 03:23.719
- That is my job.

03:23.720 --> 03:25.971
- No, apparently your job is
prescribing people crazy pills!

03:25.973 --> 03:27.095
- Not crazy pills.

03:27.096 --> 03:28.218
- They are crazy pills, okay?

03:28.219 --> 03:29.341
And I'm not crazy!

03:29.343 --> 03:30.893
- Mr. Rome--

03:30.894 --> 03:32.444
Mickey, answer me
this, at least this:

03:32.446 --> 03:34.246
Do you have a stressful job?

03:34.915 --> 03:36.398
- Sure.

03:36.399 --> 03:37.882
- All right, now enlighten me.

03:39.353 --> 03:42.554
What is it about that
job that is so stressful?

03:44.858 --> 03:49.494
- Some jobs just seem to be a
little bit harder, that's all.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.965
Like this last
one, for instance.

03:52.967 --> 03:54.250
Stay low.

03:54.251 --> 03:55.534
Stay low behind me, okay?
(woman sobbing)

03:55.536 --> 03:56.535
All right.

03:56.537 --> 03:59.771
(gun firing)
Get down, get down!

03:59.773 --> 04:01.006
Get down!

04:01.008 --> 04:03.642
(gun firing)

04:05.312 --> 04:08.280
(gun firing)

04:08.282 --> 04:09.448
(groaning)

04:09.450 --> 04:10.315
Listen.

04:10.317 --> 04:10.983
Listen to me!

04:10.985 --> 04:12.684
Hey, listen!

04:12.686 --> 04:14.052
On the count of three,

04:14.053 --> 04:15.419
you're gonna get
behind me, all right?

04:15.422 --> 04:16.688
Okay, on three.

04:18.659 --> 04:19.825
Ready?

04:19.827 --> 04:20.692
Here we go.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.394
One.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.528
Two.

04:23.530 --> 04:24.596
Three.

04:24.598 --> 04:25.709
Let's go!

04:25.710 --> 04:26.821
Move, move, move,
move, move, move!

04:26.822 --> 04:27.933
Stay low, stay low!

04:30.871 --> 04:33.872
Down, down, down, down, down!

04:35.276 --> 04:36.541
Shit.

04:36.543 --> 04:39.044
(gun firing)

04:40.814 --> 04:43.682
(woman sobbing)

04:43.684 --> 04:44.683
- Dammit, man!

04:46.720 --> 04:48.487
Who the hell are you?!

04:49.523 --> 04:51.356
- What?!

04:51.358 --> 04:52.457
- Who the hell are you?!

04:52.459 --> 04:54.559
- Mitch, shut the fuck up!

04:55.696 --> 04:56.762
Mitch: Why are you getting
involved with this?!

04:56.764 --> 04:58.330
Just give me the girl!

04:58.332 --> 05:00.299
- It's my job, asshole!

05:00.301 --> 05:01.300
- Dammit!

05:01.902 --> 05:04.736
(gun firing)

05:04.738 --> 05:06.004
- Yeah, I shoulda
never took this job.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.306
I didn't wanna take this job.

05:07.308 --> 05:08.640
- Shit.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.442
Calm down, all right?

05:10.444 --> 05:11.643
Breathe, just breathe.

05:11.644 --> 05:12.843
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

05:18.319 --> 05:18.985
We're gonna be fine.

05:18.986 --> 05:19.652
Everything's gonna be fine.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.319
Hey, asshole!

05:20.320 --> 05:20.986
- I didn't wanna take this
fucking job to begin with

05:20.987 --> 05:21.653
and I don't even like
these goddamn people!

05:21.654 --> 05:22.320
- I got a deal for ya!

05:22.321 --> 05:22.987
I keep the girl,
you go home alive.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.223
How about that?

05:24.224 --> 05:25.457
Sounds like a good
deal, doesn't it?

05:25.458 --> 05:26.691
- Fuck your deal!

05:26.694 --> 05:28.560
Look, man, just give me the girl

05:28.562 --> 05:30.896
and you can go on
your merry way!

05:30.898 --> 05:31.897
- No!

05:32.700 --> 05:34.300
(gun firing)

05:34.301 --> 05:35.901
Mitch: You motherfucker!

05:37.004 --> 05:39.905
(panting)

05:39.907 --> 05:41.540
- Don't move, okay?

05:41.542 --> 05:42.607
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

05:42.609 --> 05:43.642
Stay there.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.030
- Asshole!

06:06.767 --> 06:07.899
Drop the gun.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.604
Drop the gun.

06:19.880 --> 06:20.879
Come here.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.559
Mickey: Go ahead, do it.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.661
- You stupid bastard.

06:38.532 --> 06:41.800
(gun hammer clicking)

06:45.406 --> 06:46.405
- Mickey.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.408
- What?

06:49.409 --> 06:51.743
- You were gonna tell me
about that last job you did

06:51.745 --> 06:53.412
and how hard it was for you.

06:55.682 --> 06:56.548
- Oh.

06:56.550 --> 06:57.549
Sorry, doc.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.686
Job ain't what it used to be.

07:01.688 --> 07:04.489
- Well, age has an
effect on all of us.

07:04.491 --> 07:05.957
- Who said anything about age?

07:05.959 --> 07:07.915
- I was just trying
to make light.

07:07.916 --> 07:09.872
- You know, a guy
like me comes in here,

07:09.873 --> 07:11.829
you just reiterate the same
shit that comes outta my mouth.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.732
Some profession you got.
- Excuse me.

07:13.734 --> 07:16.568
- Oh look, here, a master's
degree in bullshit!

07:16.570 --> 07:18.036
- Excuse me!
- More bullshit.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.805
Pfft, that's horseshit.
- Feel better?

07:19.806 --> 07:21.573
- You're lucky I'm not a
depressed son of a bitch.

07:21.575 --> 07:22.841
I just might've thought
of taking a header

07:22.843 --> 07:24.643
off a goddamn skyscraper

07:24.644 --> 07:26.444
or played leapfrog
into oncoming traffic.

07:26.447 --> 07:27.697
- I hope you're not telling me

07:27.698 --> 07:28.948
you have a plan
to hurt yourself.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.199
But I will tell you this:

07:30.200 --> 07:31.450
At very least, you
have an anger problem.

07:31.452 --> 07:33.474
- Why would you say that?

07:33.475 --> 07:35.497
- You have a very,
very short fuse.

07:35.498 --> 07:37.520
- Short fuse, what is
that, some type of analogy?

07:37.524 --> 07:40.025
- You know what, Doc,
this psychotherapy shit,

07:40.027 --> 07:40.892
it ain't working.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.194
- Psychiatry.

07:42.196 --> 07:43.562
- Whatever.

07:43.563 --> 07:44.929
- Do you want the
medication or not?

07:44.932 --> 07:46.649
- Screw the pills!

07:46.650 --> 07:48.367
- I don't know what your job is,

07:48.368 --> 07:50.085
but it's having a terrible
effect on your psyche

07:50.086 --> 07:51.803
and your body, and it
could just kill ya.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.639
Mitch: Thank you, Dr. Obvious!

08:32.045 --> 08:35.113
- Mr. Rome, how good
it is to see you again.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.048
- No need for the
meet-and-greet, Chloe.

08:37.050 --> 08:39.651
- Mr. Reiser will
be with you shortly.

08:39.653 --> 08:40.886
Deacon's in the other room.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.921
I do believe you know him.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.923
- I do know who he is

08:44.924 --> 08:46.924
and I don't need
an introduction,
thank you very much.

08:57.204 --> 09:00.272
Deacon, how the hell
are you doin', buddy?

09:00.274 --> 09:01.740
Hey!

09:01.741 --> 09:03.207
- Still tracking the numbers

09:03.210 --> 09:05.176
and still getting
interrupted by you, Rome.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.545
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:06.547 --> 09:08.547
Any idea why Carl wants me here?

09:08.549 --> 09:11.850
Hey, before you answer
that, how those hands doing?

09:11.852 --> 09:14.819
You beat new information
outta anybody lately?

09:14.821 --> 09:17.289
- I'm sure it's something
very important to the agency.

09:17.291 --> 09:18.290
- Oh, I'm sure.

09:18.292 --> 09:20.959
- We do give you the tough jobs.

09:22.896 --> 09:23.895
- Yeah.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.699
- Never seen you with
your head so low, Mick.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.952
- Had a rough week, pal.

09:30.953 --> 09:32.803
- Yeah, well, nobody
said this job was easy.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.706
Hell, nobody in this
business wants to work,

09:34.708 --> 09:35.840
but somebody's gotta do it.

09:35.842 --> 09:38.376
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

09:38.377 --> 09:40.911
Speaking of which, where
is that little shit Paulie?

09:40.914 --> 09:42.147
You got him working
around here somewhere

09:42.149 --> 09:43.949
sweeping up trash?

09:43.950 --> 09:45.750
Because I haven't seen that
asshole in a hot minute.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.536
Wait.

09:47.537 --> 09:49.321
Please tell me that
you finally fired him.

09:49.323 --> 09:51.690
- Nah, Carl's got him
working on a different gig.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.342
- Guy's built like
a brick house,

09:53.343 --> 09:54.993
but he's got brains
like an outhouse.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.561
Plus, every time I think of him,

09:56.562 --> 09:58.128
the word prick
comes up in my mind.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.732
- Yeah, you never
did like him much.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.267
- You don't like him either.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.801
- Reiser will have you
both on a job real soon,

10:03.804 --> 10:05.537
I'm sure of it.

10:05.538 --> 10:07.271
You're both really good
at your individual assets.

10:07.274 --> 10:10.275
- Don't put your money on me
working with that creeper.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.144
How's he looking these days?

10:12.145 --> 10:14.012
- (laughing) He's wearing his
mustache just like Reiser.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.380
- Get the hell outta here!
- Yup.

10:15.382 --> 10:17.782
- Son of a bitch.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.385
- Mr. Rome, Mr. Reiser
will see you now.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.055
- One more thing, Deacon.

10:24.056 --> 10:25.956
This business front
you got going on,

10:25.959 --> 10:27.704
these secretaries are strippers.

10:27.705 --> 10:29.450
- They're referred to
as dancers, Mickey.

10:29.451 --> 10:31.196
- Whatever makes you sleep
better at night, pal.

10:31.198 --> 10:34.032
- And I have never shaken
my ass for dollar bills.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.069
- And I shave my head
because it's aerodynamic.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.304
See ya, Deac!

10:43.310 --> 10:44.709
(shouting)

10:44.711 --> 10:46.778
(Paulie laughing)

10:46.780 --> 10:48.346
How ya doin', Paulie?

10:48.347 --> 10:49.913
- Oh my goodness, Mickey,
I'm doing amazing.

10:49.916 --> 10:51.399
- Oh yeah; doesn't look like it.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.883
- Doesn't?
- No, you look like shit.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.369
- Oh.

10:54.370 --> 10:55.853
That's so crazy,
because I am so crisp

10:55.856 --> 10:57.355
and you look like
you're a hundred.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.990
- Don't touch,
don't touch, okay?

10:58.992 --> 11:00.091
- Yeah, you got it.

11:00.093 --> 11:00.959
- How's work?

11:00.961 --> 11:02.238
- Work is fine.

11:02.239 --> 11:03.516
- It is?
- Yeah.

11:03.517 --> 11:04.794
- Seems like you're
having a tough time.

11:04.798 --> 11:05.930
I hate your guts.
- Okay, good.

11:05.932 --> 11:07.432
- You're like herpes.

11:07.433 --> 11:08.933
You go away, but
then you come back.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.070
- Goddamn.

11:12.072 --> 11:16.274
God, you look old
as fuck. (laughing)

11:18.245 --> 11:19.878
- Hey.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.481
How are ya?

11:22.482 --> 11:25.083
Sorry I'm not shaking
hands, still a little wet.

11:26.319 --> 11:27.318
Look at this.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.954
See that?

11:29.956 --> 11:31.056
Chloe!

11:31.858 --> 11:33.458
I appreciate your authenticity,

11:33.460 --> 11:36.428
but can you get me a real
fucking chair, please?

11:37.197 --> 11:39.431
We clear $100,000 a month.

11:39.433 --> 11:42.167
My office is a porno
set, basically.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.469
Price of running a front.

11:45.272 --> 11:46.404
Glamorous.

11:47.441 --> 11:50.141
So, (pausing) what's going on?

11:50.143 --> 11:51.810
Last one was a tough one?

11:51.812 --> 11:53.344
- Aren't they all?

11:53.346 --> 11:55.113
- I mean, you saved
her, didn't you?

11:55.114 --> 11:56.881
Saved her life; she's got
you to thank for that.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.383
- Well, it's my job, right?

11:58.385 --> 12:00.052
You tell me what to do

12:00.053 --> 12:01.720
and then I go and try
and make that happen?

12:01.722 --> 12:04.122
- No, you don't
try, you succeed.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.991
You're the best
specialist I have.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.061
I mean, you got a
perfect track record.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.163
You run protection
like nobody else.

12:12.165 --> 12:13.431
- Yeah, well, it wasn't easy.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.133
But this last one--

12:15.135 --> 12:16.188
- Got to your head?

12:16.189 --> 12:17.242
- No, she coulda died.

12:17.243 --> 12:18.296
- They all coulda died.

12:18.297 --> 12:19.350
That's the name of the game.
- No, look,

12:19.351 --> 12:20.404
this one was different, okay?

12:20.407 --> 12:22.173
She's young, she has her
whole life ahead of her,

12:22.175 --> 12:23.792
and for what?

12:23.793 --> 12:25.410
Because her daddy saw something
that he wasn't supposed to,

12:25.412 --> 12:27.662
now she becomes a target?

12:27.663 --> 12:29.913
(scoffing) This fucking
world that we live in, man.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.516
Look, Carl, that's it.

12:31.518 --> 12:32.884
It's over, I'm done.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.737
- No, I know.

12:35.738 --> 12:37.955
I heard you put
in for retirement.

12:37.958 --> 12:40.792
- I can't live with myself
if someone dies on my watch.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.193
It's not in me.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.162
- Well, you got a
lot to retire on.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.998
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.367
You got bonds, CDs,
you got Treasuries,

12:49.369 --> 12:50.869
not to mention the cash.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.539
Whatchu gonna do?

12:57.911 --> 12:58.910
- I don't know.

12:58.912 --> 13:03.248
Move somewhere with palm
trees, white sand beaches.

13:04.484 --> 13:07.385
Drink one of them fruity
drinks outta those coconuts

13:07.387 --> 13:09.220
with the umbrella
sticking out of it.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.555
I don't know, maybe
I can do that.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.824
- Yeah, that sounds
like paradise.

13:16.530 --> 13:18.497
I got one more for ya.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.465
- No, Carl, come on, no.
- Please, just one.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.833
Just one--
- Carl, come on, no.

13:21.835 --> 13:24.335
Listen, hey, I can't.

13:24.337 --> 13:25.770
I can't.
- You can drink

13:25.771 --> 13:27.204
all the fruity drinks
you want after.

13:28.942 --> 13:29.874
Please.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.448
- What is it?

13:36.449 --> 13:37.949
- Husband and wife.

13:37.951 --> 13:40.251
Husband was an accountant
for the Fratelli family--

13:40.253 --> 13:42.087
- Oh god, I know
where this is going.

13:42.088 --> 13:43.922
- Stole $8 million and
he bailed with the wife.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.990
- Where's the agency on this?

13:45.992 --> 13:47.458
- They wanna turn
state's evidence.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.877
They came to me for protection

13:48.878 --> 13:50.295
while the FBI
sorts out its shit.

13:50.297 --> 13:51.613
- Well, where'd you put him?

13:51.614 --> 13:52.930
- Safe house, Central America.

13:52.931 --> 13:54.247
- Central America?
- Yeah.

13:54.248 --> 13:55.564
- Where they behead you
with chainsaws and shit?

13:55.569 --> 13:57.469
Don't they send your
head back to your mother

13:57.470 --> 13:59.370
and then put your body
up in telephone wires?

13:59.372 --> 14:00.939
I'm not going there!
- You're thinking Mexico.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.774
- No, it's not Mexico.

14:02.775 --> 14:04.608
They got cockaroaches the
size of squirrels down there!

14:04.611 --> 14:05.476
Carl: What the fuck
are you talking about?

14:05.478 --> 14:07.403
- And snakes.

14:07.404 --> 14:09.329
Goddamn snakes.
(Carl laughing)

14:09.330 --> 14:11.255
You ever watch that
National Geographic channel?

14:11.256 --> 14:13.181
They got those poisonous
arrow frog things.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.019
Send Paulie Walnuts down there!

14:15.021 --> 14:17.388
He likes crocodiles,
gloom, and death!

14:21.294 --> 14:23.194
They got palm trees.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.396
- Get out of my
office, all right?

14:25.398 --> 14:27.265
Your flight leaves
in the morning.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.500
Mickey: How easy you say
this job is gonna be?

14:29.502 --> 14:31.269
- Easy, easy-peasy.

14:31.271 --> 14:32.954
No one knows where they're at

14:32.955 --> 14:34.638
and the safe house is equipped
with all the necessities

14:34.641 --> 14:36.407
you're gonna need for
propery protection.

14:36.409 --> 14:37.976
- Big house?

14:37.978 --> 14:38.610
- Big enough.

14:38.612 --> 14:40.044
- Pool?

14:40.046 --> 14:41.463
- Yeah, they got a pool.

14:41.464 --> 14:42.881
They got a pool with
a view of the sea.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.515
You got a pool and the sea!

14:44.517 --> 14:46.128
You can see the sea!

14:46.129 --> 14:47.740
Mickey: I got boots on
the ground over there?

14:47.741 --> 14:49.352
- You got an assistant who'll
take care of everything.

14:49.356 --> 14:50.900
- Clean water?

14:50.901 --> 14:52.445
- Jesus Christ, you
got ADD, you know that?

14:52.446 --> 14:53.990
You got ADD and you're neurotic.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.159
- What are these two cats like?

14:55.161 --> 14:56.628
- Who, the husband and wife?

14:56.630 --> 14:59.965
Mickey: No, Laurel and Hardy.

14:59.966 --> 15:03.301
- The husband is scared and
the wife is a pain in the ass.

15:03.970 --> 15:04.669
She's a wife, what?

15:04.671 --> 15:08.306
Look, all you gotta do,
sit on 'em, have a whiskey,

15:08.308 --> 15:10.792
put a fuckin' umbrella
in your whiskey

15:10.793 --> 15:13.277
and wait 'til we come down
after everything blows over.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.312
- It's the last job, Carl.

15:14.314 --> 15:15.480
- Adios amigo.

15:15.482 --> 15:16.481
Gracias.

15:16.483 --> 15:17.682
Thank you for flying!

15:18.919 --> 15:20.051
Buenos dias.

15:22.689 --> 15:23.922
Chloe!

15:23.924 --> 15:27.325
(bright tropical music)

15:42.208 --> 15:43.207
- Rome?

15:47.280 --> 15:48.913
People don't really
pay attention

15:48.914 --> 15:50.547
to the lines in the
street, do they?

15:51.952 --> 15:53.584
Nobody gives a crap about
anything in this town.

15:53.586 --> 15:54.585
Look at this.

15:56.122 --> 15:57.355
There's a lotta trees.

15:57.357 --> 16:01.259
You have snakes though,
they hide in these trees.

16:01.261 --> 16:02.627
Look at this guy!

16:02.629 --> 16:04.195
Look at that, look at you.

16:05.598 --> 16:06.597
No helmet.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.418
Safety first.

16:10.419 --> 16:12.369
You got poisonous snakes
or just regular snakes?

16:14.174 --> 16:15.239
Nothing, all right.

16:16.376 --> 16:17.642
I hate snakes.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.517
Listen, I got two
words for you, okay?

16:26.519 --> 16:27.452
Air freshener.

16:27.454 --> 16:28.987
Use it.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.521
Smells like a
goddamn zoo in here.

16:42.469 --> 16:43.835
- Welcome, Mr. Rome.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.202
My name is Laurie Williams.

16:45.203 --> 16:46.569
I'm the liaison in
charge of this location

16:46.573 --> 16:48.073
and whatever else
you might need.

16:48.074 --> 16:49.574
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
great, wonderful.

16:49.576 --> 16:51.409
- It is a real pleasure
to have you here, sir.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.177
I've heard quite
a bit about you.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.046
- Listen, lady, cut
the horseshit, okay?

16:55.048 --> 16:56.715
Just show me where the goods are

16:56.716 --> 16:58.383
and introduce me to
Tweedledee and Tweedledum

16:58.385 --> 17:00.585
so I can get this last
nightmare over with.

17:00.587 --> 17:01.652
- Oh, last?

17:01.654 --> 17:02.687
- Did I stutter?

17:02.689 --> 17:05.690
- All right then,
right this way.

17:10.663 --> 17:12.480
- Yeah.

17:12.481 --> 17:14.298
I get greeted by a
goddamn waitress.

17:19.305 --> 17:21.606
(whistling)

17:21.608 --> 17:24.108
Spare no expense, huh?

17:24.110 --> 17:25.777
What's the layout like?

17:25.779 --> 17:28.513
- The house has 10 bedrooms,
a game room, a sauna,

17:28.515 --> 17:31.215
pool, hot tub, and is
four stories in height.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.834
- That's not the best place

17:32.835 --> 17:34.452
for one man to hold down
the fort, now is it?

17:34.454 --> 17:35.787
- About that...

17:52.338 --> 17:53.838
Glock here with three clips.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.106
Smooth action.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.475
Well oiled.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.477
- Well, one gun ain't
gonna make a difference.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.824
- There's a 12-gauge sawed-off
shotgun in the closet

18:12.826 --> 18:15.660
for when matters need to be
dealt with at close range.

18:15.662 --> 18:16.995
Anything within 10 feet

18:16.996 --> 18:18.329
you'll be washing red
out of your clothes

18:18.331 --> 18:19.497
for weeks to come.

18:19.498 --> 18:20.664
- Got rounds in there too?

18:20.667 --> 18:22.167
- Plenty.

18:22.168 --> 18:23.668
There's a bat in the
closet near the front door

18:23.670 --> 18:25.587
as well as some golf clubs.

18:25.588 --> 18:27.505
There's also a toolbox
out by the pool shed

18:27.507 --> 18:29.941
with plenty of
screwdrivers and a hammer,

18:29.942 --> 18:32.376
but that's rather medieval,
if I do say so myself.

18:32.378 --> 18:34.529
- Oh!

18:34.530 --> 18:36.681
So, I guess, when we're
talking about killing people,

18:36.683 --> 18:39.250
there are different levels
of how brutal one can be

18:39.252 --> 18:41.886
while trying to
stay alive, right?

18:41.888 --> 18:43.788
- Is that sarcasm, Mr. Rome?

18:43.790 --> 18:44.789
- Never.

18:45.625 --> 18:46.624
- Okay then!

18:55.435 --> 18:57.468
Mickey: You got a lotta
stairs in this house.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.203
- Oh, you'll get used to them.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.273
- Yeah, I doubt it.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.841
- This is the kitchen.

19:09.883 --> 19:14.285
Blade here, titanium,
will pierce most Kevlar.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.621
Very fast and light weapon.

19:18.158 --> 19:20.158
Burner phone here in
case you need to contact

19:20.160 --> 19:21.826
anyone within the agency.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.529
Car in the garage
for transportation.

19:24.531 --> 19:25.796
You'll need that
for emergencies.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.298
- You don't say.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.833
Laurie: Now, let's go back.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.173
- I swear, I'm not
gonna miss this job.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.310
(sighing)

19:39.946 --> 19:40.945
Holy...

19:43.216 --> 19:44.983
- Do you like it?

19:44.984 --> 19:46.751
Mr. Reiser thought this
place would suit you well.

19:46.752 --> 19:48.519
- Well, whatever
Mr. Reiser wants...

19:50.723 --> 19:52.623
Hey, it's pretty
open, don't you think?

19:52.625 --> 19:53.891
- What was that, Mr. Rome?

19:53.893 --> 19:57.295
- Open, land, lotsa space!

19:57.297 --> 19:59.697
Lotsa different ways that
people could get in here.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.465
I mean, look, for all we know,

20:01.467 --> 20:04.235
there could be snipers
out in these damn trees.

20:04.237 --> 20:06.304
- No, we assure you we've
taken all precautions.

20:06.306 --> 20:07.672
Nobody knows that
the Bauers are here.

20:07.674 --> 20:08.706
- Yeah, well, let's hope not.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.608
Wait, the Bauers?

20:10.610 --> 20:11.642
That's their name?

20:11.644 --> 20:13.010
- Indeed it is.

20:13.011 --> 20:14.377
Would you like to meet them?

20:14.378 --> 20:15.744
- Yeah, that would be nice.
- Okay.

20:15.748 --> 20:16.747
Come on.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.285
- Actually, where
are you hiding 'em?

20:21.287 --> 20:22.731
You got 'em under lock and key

20:22.732 --> 20:24.176
in one of these
overlook tower rows?

20:24.177 --> 20:25.621
Because, you know, that's
where I would be hiding 'em.

20:25.625 --> 20:26.891
- (laughing) No.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.359
No, nothing so torturous.

20:28.361 --> 20:29.694
They're out by the pool.
- Wait, what?

20:29.696 --> 20:30.912
Laurie: Yeah, come on.

20:30.913 --> 20:32.129
- No-no-no-no-no,
wait, wait, wait.

20:32.130 --> 20:33.346
You just let them
go for a damn swim

20:33.347 --> 20:34.563
out in the open by themselves?

20:34.567 --> 20:36.223
- Yeah.

20:36.224 --> 20:37.880
- Lady, do you know who
you're dealing with here?

20:37.881 --> 20:39.537
- I assure you, we have
taken all precautions.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.505
Nobody knows that they are here.

20:41.507 --> 20:44.508
- These cats, the
Fratellis, right?

20:44.510 --> 20:46.155
They find them,

20:46.156 --> 20:47.801
they're gonna decorate
their next Christmas tree

20:47.802 --> 20:49.447
with their heads as
cute little ornaments.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.099
You get what I'm saying?

20:51.100 --> 20:52.750
- I do, and that is
precisely why Mr. Reiser

20:52.752 --> 20:54.385
wanted you on this job.

20:54.386 --> 20:56.019
Now, would you like
to meet Mr. Ray Bauer

20:56.022 --> 20:57.922
and Mrs. Camilla Bauer?

20:57.924 --> 20:58.789
Come on.

20:58.791 --> 20:59.857
- Sure!

20:59.859 --> 21:01.959
Let's meet the Bauers!

21:03.596 --> 21:04.662
Unbelievable!

21:06.799 --> 21:07.798
Is it gonna rain?!

21:07.800 --> 21:08.933
Laurie: It might.

21:11.471 --> 21:12.570
- Oh, this is rich.

21:21.314 --> 21:23.514
- Mickey Rome, I take it.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.285
Thank you so much
for being here.

21:28.821 --> 21:31.622
- You're not the sharpest
tool in the shed, are ya?

21:32.959 --> 21:34.792
- I beg your pardon?

21:34.793 --> 21:36.626
- Whose idea was it
to steal $8 million

21:36.629 --> 21:39.430
from one of the most ruthless
families in the world, huh?

21:39.432 --> 21:42.633
Tell me, whose
brilliant idea was that?

21:42.635 --> 21:43.501
- Well...

21:43.503 --> 21:44.502
- It was mine.

21:45.571 --> 21:46.971
- There you go, go figure.

21:46.973 --> 21:50.474
- Should we be talking
about this right now?

21:50.476 --> 21:52.843
- Oh, I'm not the one hiding
from contract killers,

21:52.845 --> 21:54.378
having a nice leisurely swim,

21:54.380 --> 21:56.314
giving the monkeys
a goddamn view!

21:56.316 --> 21:58.449
- Yeah, I told my
husband to take the money

21:58.451 --> 22:00.384
because it was being
used for horrible things.

22:00.386 --> 22:02.653
- Newsflash, all money is, lady.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.855
- So, why let men
like that keep it

22:04.857 --> 22:06.857
when we could take it
and better our own lives?

22:06.859 --> 22:08.376
- Because you'd be dead

22:08.377 --> 22:09.894
before you could
spend a penny of it.

22:09.895 --> 22:11.412
And besides, you're
turning state's evidence.

22:11.413 --> 22:12.930
You gotta give all
that money back anyway.

22:12.932 --> 22:13.998
- I don't think so.

22:13.999 --> 22:15.065
- Oh yeah, how's that?

22:15.068 --> 22:16.701
- Well, we've cut a deal.

22:16.703 --> 22:19.403
I turn over their book
of accounts and contacts

22:20.073 --> 22:21.806
and we get to keep the money.

22:24.911 --> 22:26.877
- Did God just
deal me a shit hand

22:26.879 --> 22:29.380
in the poker game of life?!

22:29.382 --> 22:31.749
Is that what's
happening right now?!

22:31.751 --> 22:33.651
Unbelievable!
(rock clattering)

22:33.653 --> 22:34.652
Rock!

22:34.654 --> 22:37.788
- You said he was the best?

22:37.790 --> 22:39.357
- He has the best
protection rate

22:39.359 --> 22:41.559
and our agency has
the best intel.

22:41.561 --> 22:44.762
Don't worry about Mr. Rome
and his abrasive personality.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.630
He will make sure you two
live for the next few days

22:46.632 --> 22:48.733
until we can get you
transported back to stateside.

22:48.735 --> 22:51.635
- And what if we
change our minds?

22:51.637 --> 22:53.571
- You have a retainer
with us, Mr. Bauer.

22:53.572 --> 22:55.506
You have our protection
until that retainer runs out

22:55.508 --> 22:56.907
or until you refill it.

22:56.909 --> 22:59.677
(Mickey continuously cursing)
- I understand.

22:59.679 --> 23:00.862
- Bullshit!

23:00.863 --> 23:02.046
Goddamn bullshit.

23:03.816 --> 23:05.816
Are you sure that
this place is secure?

23:05.818 --> 23:07.985
- In your entire tenure for
working for us, Mr. Rome,

23:07.987 --> 23:09.920
it is the most secure
we have ever had,

23:09.922 --> 23:11.856
for it is off the grid.

23:11.857 --> 23:13.791
Otherwise, we would not call
it a safe house, would we?

23:14.694 --> 23:16.244
Shall we go inside?

23:16.245 --> 23:17.795
Mickey: Show me
where the beer is.

23:24.404 --> 23:25.069
Fuck!

23:25.071 --> 23:26.070
It's bullshit!

23:26.072 --> 23:28.539
(angrily swearing)

23:28.541 --> 23:30.691
- I shall next be in contact

23:30.692 --> 23:32.842
when we're ready to transfer
you over to the FBI.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.145
- Thank you.

23:34.147 --> 23:36.113
- Yes, we're very grateful.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.581
- No need for thanks.

23:37.583 --> 23:38.849
You paid us well.

23:38.850 --> 23:40.116
This is what our agency does.

23:40.119 --> 23:41.552
Bye for now.

23:41.554 --> 23:42.953
- Fuck this fucking place!

23:42.955 --> 23:44.422
Fuck this fucking fuck!

23:48.928 --> 23:51.095
What?!

23:56.969 --> 23:58.146
What?!

23:58.147 --> 23:59.324
What do you want?!

23:59.325 --> 24:00.502
What the fuck are you look--

24:13.853 --> 24:15.853
What does the dynamic duo want?

24:18.090 --> 24:20.858
- Well, I'd say a
conversation, Mr. Rome.

24:20.860 --> 24:24.462
- Look, the next time
someone calls me Mr. Rome,

24:24.464 --> 24:25.964
I'm gonna go into that closet,

24:25.965 --> 24:27.465
I'm gonna grab a baseball bat,

24:27.466 --> 24:28.966
come back, smash somebody
across the face with it.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.135
Just do me a favor.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.236
Call me Mickey.

24:33.206 --> 24:35.139
- All right, all right.

24:35.141 --> 24:39.109
So, where do we go
from here, Mickey?

24:42.648 --> 24:44.882
- All right, look,
nobody leaves this house,

24:44.884 --> 24:46.450
nobody leaves my sight.

24:46.451 --> 24:48.017
If you see something
suspicious, you tell me.

24:48.020 --> 24:50.087
If the neighbor's
dog takes a shit

24:50.089 --> 24:52.656
and it doesn't look right,
I wanna know about it.

24:52.658 --> 24:54.525
- You have a real way with
talking to people, don't you?

24:54.527 --> 24:55.580
- Is she always like this?

24:55.581 --> 24:56.634
You know what,
you got a real way

24:56.635 --> 24:57.688
of getting yourself
into trouble!

24:57.689 --> 24:58.742
- Is this what we should expect

24:58.743 --> 24:59.796
for the next few days?
- What?

24:59.799 --> 25:01.666
- That you're gonna
make us feel like

25:01.667 --> 25:03.534
we constantly have to
apologize for taking the money?

25:03.536 --> 25:05.069
- Stealing!

25:05.070 --> 25:06.603
Lady, you stole the money!

25:06.606 --> 25:09.907
- Well, well, quite frankly,
they stole it before we did.

25:09.909 --> 25:11.776
- How do you know that?

25:11.777 --> 25:13.644
- I saw all the deals
that were accounted for.

25:13.646 --> 25:15.513
Heroin shipments,
cocaine pickups;

25:15.515 --> 25:19.083
anything that had a dollar
value, I had to account for it.

25:19.085 --> 25:22.586
- Yeah, we need to get
something straight, Mickey.

25:22.588 --> 25:25.923
We paid a huge chunk of
cash to have you here,

25:25.925 --> 25:28.993
and I'm a bit shocked
they didn't send more.

25:30.096 --> 25:32.630
- What is that supposed to mean?

25:32.631 --> 25:35.165
- I think we thought
that they'd send

25:35.166 --> 25:37.700
somebody a bit (pausing)
younger is all, right?

25:37.703 --> 25:39.920
- Yup.

25:39.921 --> 25:42.138
Bottom line is
you're our employee.

25:42.141 --> 25:46.143
So, if we wanna go on a
walk on the beach, we will.

25:46.145 --> 25:49.713
If we wanna go lounge
in the sun, we will.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.248
If we wanna go into town,

25:51.250 --> 25:53.984
you are gonna be by our
side with your eyes open

25:53.986 --> 25:56.053
and your ears
constantly listening.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.556
Do we understand each other?

25:58.558 --> 26:03.694
- I understand (pausing) that
I need to make a phone call.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.164
- It's, it's okay.

26:07.166 --> 26:09.133
He's been drinking.

26:09.135 --> 26:10.267
He's a little angry.

26:18.244 --> 26:19.643
- Reiser speaking.

26:19.645 --> 26:20.578
Mickey: Get me outta here, Carl.

26:20.580 --> 26:21.679
This is bullshit!

26:21.681 --> 26:22.813
- Mickey, calm down.

26:22.815 --> 26:24.749
Mickey: No, no, no.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.684
You got me protecting
two entitled kids

26:26.685 --> 26:28.619
who have no idea the trouble
they got themselves into.

26:28.621 --> 26:30.371
- Just sit on 'em.

26:30.372 --> 26:32.122
Just relax, sit on
'em for 72 hours.

26:32.124 --> 26:34.592
I know you at least can do that.

26:34.594 --> 26:36.060
Mickey: You got me trying
to protect Fort Knox,

26:36.062 --> 26:37.612
for Christ sakes.

26:37.613 --> 26:39.163
This place is bigger than
the Bermuda Triangle!

26:39.165 --> 26:41.732
- You're mixing your
metaphors again.

26:41.733 --> 26:44.300
Mickey, is it Fort Knox or
is it the Bermuda Triangle?

26:44.303 --> 26:45.769
Regardless...

26:47.340 --> 26:48.856
I'm a little hurt

26:48.857 --> 26:50.373
'cause honestly I thought
you would like that.

26:51.677 --> 26:53.844
Mickey: Oh, it's nice, sure.

26:53.846 --> 26:56.430
But I have a hard
time doing my job

26:56.431 --> 26:59.015
knowing that the goddamn
toucans can get in this place.

26:59.018 --> 27:02.353
- I'd completely side with
you if it were a problem,

27:02.355 --> 27:04.855
but it's not a problem, you see?

27:04.857 --> 27:06.390
There is nothing to worry about.

27:06.392 --> 27:07.903
I hear you.

27:07.904 --> 27:09.415
If there were something
to worry about,

27:09.416 --> 27:10.927
I would completely
understand, but there's not.

27:10.930 --> 27:13.130
There's nothing to worry about.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.899
Mickey: Everybody
keeps saying that.

27:14.900 --> 27:16.667
Do you know something
that I don't?

27:16.669 --> 27:19.269
- The feds are occupying
the Fratellis, okay?

27:19.271 --> 27:22.072
There's taps on all of
their colleagues' phones.

27:22.074 --> 27:25.042
If the wind so much as
blows in this direction,

27:25.044 --> 27:27.077
we'll know it, if
you catch my drift.

27:27.079 --> 27:28.679
Mickey: Yeah.

27:30.016 --> 27:32.650
- Just kick back, would ya?

27:32.652 --> 27:34.852
Let the married
couple do their thing.

27:34.854 --> 27:36.420
You go through the paces

27:36.422 --> 27:39.023
and try to relax and
enjoy the sunshine.

27:39.025 --> 27:40.374
Mickey: Fuck the sunshine.

27:40.375 --> 27:41.724
I'll call you
tomorrow to check in.

27:43.963 --> 27:45.763
- "Fuck the sunshine."

28:49.261 --> 28:51.061
- Do you mind some company?

28:58.504 --> 29:00.337
- Look, I don't have anything
left in the tank, okay?

29:00.339 --> 29:01.972
So just be easy on me.

29:04.443 --> 29:06.043
- Is that such a good idea?

29:08.380 --> 29:09.880
- I'll have you
know I aim better

29:09.882 --> 29:11.415
when I'm under the influence.

29:14.987 --> 29:15.986
- I'm sorry.

29:20.326 --> 29:21.892
- For what?

29:21.894 --> 29:23.127
- I was rude earlier.

29:24.764 --> 29:26.930
I do understand we're
in a bad situation.

29:32.071 --> 29:34.371
My mother was in
really bad shape.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.041
She needed a heart transplant.

29:39.145 --> 29:42.312
They'd only given her
a few months to live.

29:44.216 --> 29:47.785
We'd asked the doctors how we
could get her name moved up.

29:49.288 --> 29:52.422
A few of them knew
that my husband worked
for the Fratellis,

29:53.793 --> 29:57.327
so they said that if we came
back with a high enough number,

29:57.329 --> 29:59.329
they'd bump her to
the top of the list.

30:01.333 --> 30:03.300
So, he started embezzling funds,

30:04.970 --> 30:06.870
just a few dollars
here and there,

30:07.473 --> 30:09.239
from hundreds of accounts.

30:11.310 --> 30:14.812
And he would cook the books
so they'd never find out.

30:16.882 --> 30:18.949
There were millions coming in.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.903
For three months we did this

30:22.904 --> 30:25.588
and I would just try to figure
out where to hide the cash.

30:25.591 --> 30:27.024
The flowerbed.

30:28.093 --> 30:29.359
My locker at the gym.

30:31.964 --> 30:36.066
Eventually, we knew that they'd
find out, so we prepared.

30:37.503 --> 30:38.869
And now, here we are.

30:42.074 --> 30:43.207
And my mother...

30:45.177 --> 30:46.176
She lived.

30:50.516 --> 30:50.981
So, it was worth it, Mickey.

30:56.155 --> 30:58.856
- You may only have postponed
your mother's death.

31:00.059 --> 31:01.258
- No, she's safe.

31:04.230 --> 31:05.046
Safer than us.

31:05.047 --> 31:05.863
- Agency protecting her too?

31:07.066 --> 31:08.065
- No.

31:12.938 --> 31:15.138
- Hospital really
stuck it to ya, huh?

31:16.909 --> 31:19.643
- No, everyone just looks out
for themselves in this world.

31:21.013 --> 31:24.548
They find something to leverage
and they play their cards.

31:24.550 --> 31:25.515
Some win.

31:26.385 --> 31:27.417
Some lose.

31:29.088 --> 31:30.087
- Yeah.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.223
I've always hated hospitals.

31:49.008 --> 31:49.723
- Mr. Rome?

31:49.724 --> 31:50.439
Do you have many friends?

31:52.444 --> 31:55.946
I don't mean the
question in a mean way.

31:55.948 --> 31:57.447
I mean to ask because

31:59.418 --> 32:01.318
your job must make you lonely.

32:04.256 --> 32:09.393
You know, protecting other
people for hours, days, nights;

32:12.031 --> 32:17.134
like tonight must take you
away from people you love.

32:19.471 --> 32:20.470
So...

32:21.307 --> 32:22.406
I was thinking

32:22.408 --> 32:27.411
maybe you weren't close
to too many people.

32:33.953 --> 32:38.956
I understand someone like
me might just be a job

32:40.726 --> 32:43.460
and that you probably
have had to protect

32:43.462 --> 32:45.262
a lot of defenseless people

32:45.264 --> 32:48.565
with rich parents or
husbands or whatever.

32:52.705 --> 32:53.704
But...

32:55.641 --> 32:59.509
I just wanna say thank
you for being here.

33:46.358 --> 33:49.292
(tools clanking)

34:17.589 --> 34:20.057
- Hey, boss, ain't
it a bit late?

34:21.427 --> 34:22.576
Oh!

34:22.577 --> 34:23.726
People are trying to sleep here!

34:42.681 --> 34:45.348
(gun firing)

34:50.722 --> 34:54.157
- (laughing) Mickey!

34:54.159 --> 34:57.461
You still using that
pussy .38 Special?

34:57.463 --> 34:59.262
When you gonna get
a big boy's gun?

34:59.264 --> 35:01.131
- Francisco, you asshole!

35:01.834 --> 35:04.501
(gun firing)

35:36.602 --> 35:39.136
(groaning)

35:43.709 --> 35:44.708
- Yeah.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.309
Get your ass up.

35:46.311 --> 35:47.177
Come on.

35:47.179 --> 35:48.578
Come on, get up!

35:52.818 --> 35:55.819
(Mickey groaning)

35:56.688 --> 35:57.687
Girl's gotta go.

36:25.217 --> 36:26.216
- Who was she?

36:28.921 --> 36:30.754
- She was a client,
just like you.

36:33.225 --> 36:34.224
- Did she live?

36:38.597 --> 36:40.697
- Yeah, she did.

36:40.699 --> 36:41.698
- Hey.

36:43.535 --> 36:45.402
What'd I miss?

36:47.506 --> 36:50.607
- Your wife was explaining to
me why y'all stole the money.

36:53.979 --> 36:54.978
- Oh.

36:58.850 --> 37:02.285
- Look, I'll try not
to be an asshole, okay?

37:02.287 --> 37:02.719
But I make no promises.

37:07.626 --> 37:09.893
How did you become
their accountant anyway?

37:11.897 --> 37:13.697
- My father.

37:13.698 --> 37:15.498
He, he worked for them.

37:15.500 --> 37:16.800
- In what capacity?

37:16.802 --> 37:17.801
- Same thing.

37:17.803 --> 37:21.805
I was raised being told this
was the family business.

37:24.376 --> 37:26.343
- Some Sopranos-type bullshit.

37:29.514 --> 37:31.381
$8 million.

37:38.590 --> 37:39.589
What?

37:41.426 --> 37:43.693
- It wasn't actually $8 million.

37:46.365 --> 37:47.797
It was $23 million.

37:49.034 --> 37:50.467
- What?

37:50.469 --> 37:52.002
Do the feds know this?

37:52.004 --> 37:54.404
- No.

37:54.405 --> 37:56.805
The only actual traceable
money is the $8 million.

37:56.808 --> 37:58.842
- Traceable?

37:58.843 --> 38:00.877
- As in, what the
Fratellis might notice.

38:00.879 --> 38:04.014
- How does $15
million go unnoticed?

38:05.784 --> 38:06.983
- I found an account.

38:08.553 --> 38:10.320
It wasn't listed on
any of the ledgers,

38:10.322 --> 38:13.290
it was just (pausing) there.

38:14.893 --> 38:18.828
So, I took a look at
deposit schedules,

38:18.830 --> 38:20.864
past withdrawals, everything.

38:22.301 --> 38:23.800
No one associated
with the family

38:23.802 --> 38:25.969
had anything to do
with that account.

38:27.806 --> 38:30.707
So, at first, I siphoned
off a few hundred thousand,

38:30.709 --> 38:32.842
just to see if there
were any red flags.

38:34.313 --> 38:35.312
Nothing.

38:36.648 --> 38:37.681
Then a million.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.016
Not a peep.

38:42.587 --> 38:44.921
So, one day I just brought it up

38:44.923 --> 38:47.724
in water cooler
talk-type fashion.

38:47.726 --> 38:50.327
No one knew anything
about that account.

38:51.463 --> 38:54.431
So, when Camilla and
I set up our plan,

38:54.433 --> 38:55.632
it was the motherlode.

38:57.469 --> 38:59.402
That was our nest egg.

39:02.674 --> 39:05.342
If they weren't gonna let
us keep our $8 million,

39:06.545 --> 39:08.745
at least we had the
rest to fall back on.

39:10.549 --> 39:14.117
- Well, I guess,
like someone said,

39:14.119 --> 39:16.619
when you have leverage,
you play those cards.

39:21.793 --> 39:23.360
You two should go to bed.

39:24.596 --> 39:26.329
I gotta spend the
rest of the night

39:26.330 --> 39:28.063
watching toucans and
monkeys fuck in the trees.

39:32.771 --> 39:34.471
- Come on.
- Good night, Mickey.

39:34.473 --> 39:35.472
- Yeah.

39:37.442 --> 39:38.575
- Thank you.

39:46.485 --> 39:47.784
- Yeah, don't mention it.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.591
- Do you have many friends?

39:54.593 --> 39:57.660
(gun firing)

39:57.662 --> 40:00.430
I don't mean the
question in a mean way.

40:00.432 --> 40:03.667
(groaning)
(gun firing)

40:03.668 --> 40:06.903
I mean to ask because (pausing)
your work must be lonely.

40:11.009 --> 40:12.776
(gun firing)

40:12.777 --> 40:14.544
You aren't close to many people.

40:14.546 --> 40:17.947
(growing ominous music)

40:23.088 --> 40:24.954
(gasping)

40:24.956 --> 40:25.955
- Morning.

40:29.694 --> 40:30.927
- What time is it?

40:30.929 --> 40:31.928
- It's 8:00.

40:31.930 --> 40:34.931
Ray and I wanna go
to the beach today.

40:36.501 --> 40:38.051
- Wonderful.

40:38.052 --> 40:39.602
That's a safe place to go.

40:39.604 --> 40:40.637
- Are you coming?

40:43.809 --> 40:44.808
- Fine.

40:46.011 --> 40:47.110
Camilla: Thank you.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.210
- Let's go to the beach.

40:54.653 --> 40:57.787
Hot, hot, hot. (exhaling)

40:57.789 --> 40:58.755
I'm up.

40:59.758 --> 41:00.757
That's hot.

41:10.869 --> 41:13.470
It's like you two are on
vacation, it's insane.

41:15.874 --> 41:16.973
- Yeah, not quite.

41:20.712 --> 41:22.145
- I heard you were
the scared one.

41:22.147 --> 41:23.146
- Scared?

41:23.982 --> 41:24.948
Yeah.

41:27.719 --> 41:28.718
But not for me.

41:29.955 --> 41:30.954
For Camilla.

41:32.991 --> 41:35.058
See, I don't care
what happens to me.

41:38.630 --> 41:39.829
But I couldn't live with myself

41:39.830 --> 41:41.029
if anything happened to her.

41:42.167 --> 41:44.501
- Well, to love.

41:44.503 --> 41:45.768
It can be a bitch.

41:50.175 --> 41:52.742
- So, were you ever
married, Mickey?

41:52.744 --> 41:53.743
- Once.

41:57.048 --> 41:59.082
What?

41:59.083 --> 42:01.117
Do you want me to
elaborate on that?

42:02.921 --> 42:03.970
- Yeah, why not?

42:03.971 --> 42:05.020
- We're not friends, okay?

42:05.023 --> 42:06.656
This is a job.

42:06.658 --> 42:09.158
Why don't you people
understand that?

42:10.962 --> 42:12.962
Look, women want
one thing one day,

42:12.964 --> 42:15.532
and then another day
they want something else.

42:16.268 --> 42:17.233
- And?

42:18.637 --> 42:20.937
- And I had a wife, okay?

42:20.939 --> 42:23.873
And she wanted to have
kids, so we had one.

42:23.875 --> 42:26.042
Wasn't in this profession
then, I was a cop.

42:26.044 --> 42:27.810
I was working all
sorts of crazy hours,

42:27.812 --> 42:30.146
was never really home much.

42:30.148 --> 42:32.549
- I'm sure that had to be tough.

42:32.551 --> 42:33.816
- That was hard enough.

42:33.818 --> 42:36.986
- So, I take it you two
aren't still together.

42:38.990 --> 42:40.807
So, then what happened?

42:40.808 --> 42:42.625
- You're a persistent
little prick, aren't you?

42:42.627 --> 42:44.694
- Yeah, my wife's been
known to say the same thing.

42:44.696 --> 42:45.695
Yeah.

42:47.332 --> 42:48.598
Well, like I said,

42:50.735 --> 42:51.801
long hours.

42:56.908 --> 42:59.642
You know, for five years
all she had was that kid.

43:00.645 --> 43:02.645
She had to take care
of it all by herself.

43:05.717 --> 43:07.801
I'd come home late
in the mornings

43:07.802 --> 43:09.886
and I would stare
at her in her crib.

43:11.122 --> 43:14.290
In a blink of an eye, she's
sleeping in a little bed.

43:17.262 --> 43:20.280
I'd try to get home
early from work

43:20.281 --> 43:23.299
just to rock her to sleep,
but being a cop, it's rare.

43:23.301 --> 43:24.634
But my wife...

43:26.771 --> 43:31.174
She couldn't handle it, so
she took to the pills first,

43:32.143 --> 43:34.460
then the booze.

43:34.461 --> 43:36.778
I came home one night after
busting this big case.

43:36.781 --> 43:39.148
Wine, flowers, the
whole nine yards, right?

43:41.086 --> 43:43.753
Found her dead on
the floor, overdose.

43:44.856 --> 43:46.155
I go to look for my kid.

43:54.165 --> 43:56.633
(sighing)

43:59.838 --> 44:01.137
She's dead in the tub.

44:06.845 --> 44:09.045
Wife drowned her
during bath time.

44:10.649 --> 44:12.015
She used to have
this yellow ducky

44:12.017 --> 44:13.282
that she fuckin' loved so much

44:13.284 --> 44:15.284
and it was just floating there

44:15.285 --> 44:17.285
with a goddamn smile
stretched across its face.

44:19.658 --> 44:20.657
- Mickey...

44:23.962 --> 44:25.194
I'm so sorry, man.

44:25.964 --> 44:27.631
- Don't be.

44:27.632 --> 44:29.299
Life throws you curveballs
and can be a son of a bitch.

44:29.300 --> 44:30.967
All you can do is
try and hit 'em.

44:33.338 --> 44:34.837
That's it for story time.

44:44.683 --> 44:46.816
(waves crashing)

44:46.818 --> 44:49.318
Camilla: Are we safe, Ray?

44:53.358 --> 44:55.725
Ray: Yeah, I think so.

44:57.162 --> 44:58.961
- Do you trust him?

44:59.898 --> 45:01.164
- Who, Mickey?

45:07.038 --> 45:08.271
Yeah.

45:08.273 --> 45:09.472
I think I do.

45:11.710 --> 45:14.844
- I don't know who
to trust anymore.

45:16.181 --> 45:17.180
- Hey.

45:18.750 --> 45:21.784
Why are you feeling this way?

45:21.786 --> 45:23.119
- Just, the more that
Mickey keeps going on

45:23.121 --> 45:25.477
about these people,

45:25.478 --> 45:27.834
the more I feel like maybe
this is just too easy.

45:27.835 --> 45:30.191
- And that's why we paid what
we did, for this protection.

45:31.996 --> 45:33.796
For his protection.

45:38.870 --> 45:41.137
- I don't have a good
feeling about any of this.

45:41.139 --> 45:42.805
- Listen to me.

45:42.807 --> 45:46.142
Everything is gonna
be okay, I promise.

45:46.144 --> 45:48.211
We will turn in state's evidence

45:48.212 --> 45:50.279
and we will make sure that
the Fratellis are put away.

45:50.281 --> 45:53.015
And then, we will disappear.

45:53.985 --> 45:55.752
- You make it sound so simple.

45:57.922 --> 46:01.824
I actually think it's gonna be
a lot harder than we thought.

46:01.826 --> 46:04.427
- Then we will face it.

46:04.429 --> 46:05.428
Together.

46:11.770 --> 46:12.769
- Get a room!

46:14.372 --> 46:17.006
Jesus!
(Ray laughing)

46:17.008 --> 46:18.391
- Is it so wrong
to hate the fact

46:18.392 --> 46:19.775
that he's starting
to grow on me?

46:19.778 --> 46:20.777
- Me too.

46:23.548 --> 46:25.148
- He's got a lotta baggage, Cam.

46:25.150 --> 46:26.482
- Yeah, what gave it away?

46:26.484 --> 46:27.917
- No, I'm serious.

46:28.787 --> 46:30.286
I spent a little time with him.

46:31.322 --> 46:33.189
You know, he comes
off as incapable,

46:33.191 --> 46:38.094
but I think he's way more
capable than we know.

46:39.564 --> 46:41.130
- I won't doubt that then.

46:50.942 --> 46:52.375
- Hey!

46:52.377 --> 46:53.943
Stay here, don't move.

47:07.992 --> 47:09.617
What are you doing here, Paulie?

47:09.618 --> 47:11.243
'Cause any other
reason than the best

47:11.244 --> 47:12.869
is gonna make me
pretty fucking uneasy.

47:12.870 --> 47:14.495
- Yeah, well, the call
you made to Reiser

47:14.499 --> 47:15.732
made him a little bit hesitant

47:15.733 --> 47:16.966
that you can handle this thing.

47:16.968 --> 47:17.967
- Hesitant?

47:17.969 --> 47:20.970
I never quit a job in my
life, even you know that.

47:20.972 --> 47:22.839
- Ah, yeah, well...

47:22.841 --> 47:24.240
We all slip up
sometimes, don't we?

47:24.242 --> 47:25.925
- Nah.

47:25.926 --> 47:27.609
You see, Mickey Rome,
he doesn't slip up.

47:29.414 --> 47:30.980
- How the lovebirds doing?

47:30.982 --> 47:32.265
- Fine.

47:32.266 --> 47:33.549
- And what about you, you okay?

47:33.550 --> 47:34.833
- What's with the small talk?

47:34.834 --> 47:36.117
- Just trying to
be friendly, Mick.

47:36.120 --> 47:38.988
(both laughing)

47:40.124 --> 47:42.258
- You ain't got a friendly
bone in your body.

47:44.395 --> 47:46.162
- Well, since we're gonna
be working together now,

47:46.163 --> 47:47.930
I figured I'd try
to keep it cordial.

47:48.867 --> 47:49.999
- Working together?

47:50.000 --> 47:51.132
Nobody told me
anything about that.

47:51.135 --> 47:52.535
- No?

47:52.537 --> 47:55.137
Well, maybe you should
call Deacon and Reiser.

47:56.140 --> 48:00.209
I'll tell ya what, let
me call 'em for ya.

48:06.384 --> 48:07.884
Yeah, it's me.

48:09.320 --> 48:10.586
Uh-huh.

48:10.588 --> 48:12.154
Yeah, he's right in front of me.

48:12.156 --> 48:13.155
Absolutely.

48:15.560 --> 48:16.525
- Yeah.

48:18.429 --> 48:20.963
(grunting)

48:21.900 --> 48:25.101
- Mickey, I see Paulie found ya.

48:25.103 --> 48:27.904
- Yeah, he's staring at me
like a hawk stares at a rabbit.

48:27.906 --> 48:29.372
Deacon: Cute.

48:29.374 --> 48:31.207
- Is there anything
I should know about?

48:33.378 --> 48:35.177
(man coughing)

48:35.179 --> 48:37.013
- Nothing to worry about.

48:37.015 --> 48:38.882
Carl just thought you might need

48:38.883 --> 48:40.750
a little extra set of
hands just in case.

48:40.751 --> 48:42.618
Paulie's gonna be around
just if it gets to that point

48:42.620 --> 48:44.253
where you can't
take it, that's all.

48:44.255 --> 48:45.644
- Well, if it's okay with you,

48:45.645 --> 48:47.034
I'd like him not to
stay at the McMansion.

48:47.035 --> 48:48.424
He gives me the heebie-jeebies.

48:50.128 --> 48:52.595
- You got anything
worthwhile to contribute yet?

48:53.932 --> 48:54.931
- Fuck you.

48:58.937 --> 49:00.436
(coughing)

49:00.438 --> 49:02.204
- Paulie's gonna be around.

49:02.206 --> 49:05.474
Listen, Mickey, I know
you don't like him,

49:05.476 --> 49:08.244
but he's effective
and he's efficient.

49:08.246 --> 49:10.212
- You used to say that
about me a time or two ago.

49:10.214 --> 49:11.514
- Just play nice, Mickey.

49:11.516 --> 49:13.316
I'll see you when you get back.

49:15.053 --> 49:16.118
(grunting)
- Yeah.

49:20.224 --> 49:21.090
- Everything go good?

49:21.092 --> 49:21.958
- Peachy.

49:21.960 --> 49:22.959
- Fantastic.

49:22.961 --> 49:26.529
Now, if anything should
happen, call me right away.

49:28.066 --> 49:31.100
I know Laurie programmed
my number into your phone.

49:31.102 --> 49:32.101
Hey, Mick.

49:33.371 --> 49:35.137
Careful out there.

49:35.139 --> 49:38.641
You never know who
you're gonna run into.

49:55.226 --> 49:56.659
Ray: Hey.

49:56.661 --> 49:57.872
Who was that, Mickey?

49:57.873 --> 49:59.084
- They sent another one.

49:59.085 --> 50:00.296
- Another--
- Specialist, like me.

50:00.298 --> 50:01.351
- Why would they do that?

50:01.352 --> 50:02.405
- Because they don't think
I got it in me no more,

50:02.406 --> 50:03.459
all right?

50:03.460 --> 50:04.513
Grab your shit, let's go.

50:04.514 --> 50:05.567
Let's go!

50:05.570 --> 50:07.003
- Let's go, come on, come on.
- Okay.

50:08.473 --> 50:09.538
- Let's go.

50:11.142 --> 50:12.675
Let's go, come on.

50:38.536 --> 50:39.769
Good afternoon, Mickey.

50:41.339 --> 50:42.705
- What's so good about it?

50:44.776 --> 50:48.077
- Well, we're still
alive, right? (laughing)

50:48.079 --> 50:49.078
- For now.

50:52.617 --> 50:54.183
- I'm sorry.

50:54.185 --> 50:55.384
Bad joke, I guess.

50:58.056 --> 50:59.388
- Yeah, what do you want?

51:03.461 --> 51:04.660
- Can you take a walk?

51:11.202 --> 51:12.334
Yeah, sure.

51:12.336 --> 51:13.769
I gotta do my rounds anyway.

51:26.717 --> 51:27.850
- So, I have a question.

51:27.852 --> 51:29.318
- You have a million.

51:33.758 --> 51:35.858
- Did you always
run protection gigs?

51:38.362 --> 51:39.361
- No.

51:39.363 --> 51:40.362
Why?

51:43.534 --> 51:46.202
- I know your company
does other things as well.

51:47.371 --> 51:50.272
- Yeah, it's a
business, all of it.

51:52.143 --> 51:53.242
- So...

51:55.113 --> 51:56.178
Did you do...

51:59.283 --> 52:01.383
Did you do other
things with them

52:02.487 --> 52:05.855
or other things
entirely different?

52:07.391 --> 52:09.391
- Where are you going with this?

52:09.393 --> 52:11.727
- I just wanna know how
your business works.

52:11.729 --> 52:13.120
- Why?

52:13.121 --> 52:14.512
Why do you even care?

52:14.513 --> 52:15.904
- Why did they send
another protection agent?

52:15.905 --> 52:17.296
- Because I'm getting
fuckin' old, okay?

52:17.301 --> 52:18.267
That's why.

52:19.804 --> 52:21.403
Is that what you wanna hear.

52:22.507 --> 52:24.473
- Old for this
type of occupation?

52:26.744 --> 52:28.444
- Yeah.

52:28.445 --> 52:30.145
I mean, most guys,
they retire around 40.

52:31.916 --> 52:32.882
Just...

52:32.884 --> 52:35.284
Too many blows to the
head, too many scars.

52:35.285 --> 52:37.685
We're just, we're
human, all right?

52:39.690 --> 52:42.658
That's why they sent the
asshole as an insurance policy.

52:45.796 --> 52:47.863
- Insurance policy.
- Yeah.

52:47.864 --> 52:49.931
Something goes wrong, they
got somebody close by.

52:51.569 --> 52:53.402
- Well, that doesn't make sense.

52:54.739 --> 52:57.773
- One minute it does, the
next minute it doesn't.

53:02.513 --> 53:03.646
Yeah, but...

53:06.784 --> 53:08.317
Why Paulie, you know?

53:11.255 --> 53:13.389
That's what I don't understand.

53:15.693 --> 53:16.926
- Yeah, about that guy,

53:16.928 --> 53:19.728
you know, the one we
saw at the beach today?

53:19.730 --> 53:20.896
What's wrong with him?

53:23.201 --> 53:24.800
- He doesn't work in protection.

53:25.603 --> 53:26.936
- Well then, what's he do?

53:28.940 --> 53:30.973
- He works in collections.

53:30.975 --> 53:32.808
(soft country music)

53:32.810 --> 53:34.843
Remember I told you
that I did something

53:34.845 --> 53:37.880
before I worked in the
protection department?

53:37.882 --> 53:38.881
Ray: Yeah.

53:40.218 --> 53:41.617
- I worked in collections.

53:43.788 --> 53:45.204
Are you calling
'cause you miss me

53:45.205 --> 53:46.621
or are you giving
me the thumbs-up?

53:47.625 --> 53:48.757
Yes to which part?

53:51.562 --> 53:52.995
What if he doesn't have it?

53:52.997 --> 53:57.566
Look, Carl, I'm not in the
business of killing people.

54:02.340 --> 54:03.505
Yeah.

54:03.507 --> 54:04.506
Got it.

54:12.783 --> 54:13.816
Excuse me, miss.

54:13.818 --> 54:17.519
Can I get a bottle of your
best champagne, please?

54:17.521 --> 54:19.588
- Best champagne?

54:19.590 --> 54:21.657
You having a spendy
afternoon, are you?

54:22.960 --> 54:25.995
Which one of the girls you
showing a good time to?

54:25.997 --> 54:28.297
- Oh, it's not for
any of the girls.

54:28.299 --> 54:29.665
It's my friend over there.

54:29.667 --> 54:31.800
- Oh, you're friends with Matty?

54:31.802 --> 54:32.801
- Best friends.

54:32.803 --> 54:35.938
- Bottle of Dom
coming right up then.

54:43.948 --> 54:44.813
There you go.

54:44.815 --> 54:45.831
- Ah, thank you.

54:45.832 --> 54:46.848
No need for glasses.

54:46.851 --> 54:48.550
Not gonna need it.

54:48.552 --> 54:49.752
Oh, and do me a favor.

54:50.688 --> 54:51.887
Put it on Matty's tab.

54:56.661 --> 54:57.660
Matty!

54:58.629 --> 54:59.662
My man!

54:59.664 --> 55:00.829
How ya doin'?

55:02.300 --> 55:03.966
- Do I know you, man?

55:03.967 --> 55:05.633
- Nope, you actually do not.

55:06.871 --> 55:08.737
- Okay, well, then why the
fuck are you interrupting

55:08.739 --> 55:11.640
a conversation between
me and my man here?

55:11.642 --> 55:12.641
- Bruiser.

55:14.345 --> 55:15.611
Long time no see.

55:15.613 --> 55:16.679
- Mickey Rome.

55:16.681 --> 55:19.782
Thought I smelled shit when
I walked in here today.

55:19.784 --> 55:22.084
(Matty laughing)

55:22.086 --> 55:23.819
- That's because you're the
one who usually steps in it.

55:23.821 --> 55:26.455
How's unemployment
treating you these days?

55:26.457 --> 55:27.890
- Do I look unemployed to you?

55:27.892 --> 55:30.426
- Hmm, let's take a look atcha.

55:30.428 --> 55:32.712
Eh, maybe not,

55:32.713 --> 55:34.997
but this guy looks like he
shops at the bargain bin, huh?

55:34.999 --> 55:38.000
What were the deals last
week, three suits for $99.99?

55:38.002 --> 55:40.836
(all laughing)

55:42.406 --> 55:44.707
- Always with the
comedy, huh, Mickey?

55:44.709 --> 55:46.041
Get the fuck outta here.

55:46.043 --> 55:47.976
- I'm afraid I can't do that.

55:47.978 --> 55:49.978
You see, I'm here for a reason,

55:49.980 --> 55:51.980
and that reason you're
really not gonna like

55:51.982 --> 55:54.616
and that Bruiser here
can probably guess.

55:54.618 --> 55:56.485
- Mickey, I ain't
gonna ask you twice.

55:56.487 --> 55:58.754
- You think I give a
fuck about that reason?

55:58.756 --> 56:00.489
- I feel like you should.

56:00.491 --> 56:01.574
My name is Mickey.

56:01.575 --> 56:02.658
I'm here on behalf
of Carl Reiser.

56:02.659 --> 56:03.742
You know who I'm talking about?

56:03.743 --> 56:04.826
Bruiser: Take a hike, Mickey.

56:05.763 --> 56:07.496
- Yeah, I know who he is.

56:08.366 --> 56:09.531
So, what's this about?

56:09.533 --> 56:10.733
- All right, good.

56:10.735 --> 56:12.401
See, progress.

56:12.403 --> 56:14.587
You borrowed money a while ago

56:14.588 --> 56:16.772
to open up this
miraculous establishment.

56:16.774 --> 56:18.741
It's seedy as fuck!

56:18.743 --> 56:21.110
Anyway, you never paid it back.

56:21.112 --> 56:24.980
So, today, I'm here to
collect the bill in full.

56:24.982 --> 56:25.981
- In full?

56:27.151 --> 56:29.918
(all laughing)

56:31.655 --> 56:35.023
I knew I recognized this
guy, he's a fucking comedian!

56:35.025 --> 56:36.825
- I'm gonna get that
money. (laughing)

56:36.827 --> 56:38.861
Matty:You're sure gonna get it.

56:38.863 --> 56:40.095
Bruiser, will you do me a favor?

56:40.097 --> 56:41.814
- Yes sir.

56:41.815 --> 56:43.532
Matty: Would you make
it so princess here

56:43.533 --> 56:45.250
sips out of a straw for the
rest of his fucking life?

56:45.251 --> 56:46.968
- It'd be my pleasure.
- That's a bad idea.

56:48.773 --> 56:50.773
(glass shattering)

56:50.775 --> 56:53.075
(shouting)

56:55.045 --> 56:58.647
(grunting and groaning)

57:04.021 --> 57:05.788
- I fucking hate my job!

57:05.790 --> 57:07.689
- Wanna switch?

57:07.691 --> 57:11.093
(grunting and groaning)

57:35.119 --> 57:36.752
I hate that suit!

57:38.956 --> 57:41.034
So, I went from being a cop

57:41.035 --> 57:43.113
to collecting money to
beating the shit outta people

57:43.114 --> 57:45.192
to protecting people who
couldn't protect themselves.

57:46.130 --> 57:47.763
Weird world we live in, man.

57:48.566 --> 57:51.099
Like I said, curveballs.

58:07.618 --> 58:10.219
(uneasy music)

58:49.727 --> 58:52.728
(water splashing)

58:57.268 --> 59:00.869
(grunting and groaning)

59:04.308 --> 59:07.643
(suspenseful music)

59:38.576 --> 59:40.576
(groaning)

59:40.578 --> 59:42.844
(panting)

59:52.256 --> 59:53.989
(doorbell ringing)

59:53.991 --> 59:56.124
"Most secure place
we ever had," my ass.

1:00:17.114 --> 1:00:18.280
Shit!

1:00:25.022 --> 1:00:27.055
- Hello, Mr. Rome, I just
wanted to see how things are

1:00:27.057 --> 1:00:28.473
and if everything's okay.

1:00:28.474 --> 1:00:29.890
- No, Laurie,
things are not okay!

1:00:29.893 --> 1:00:31.293
We need to leave right now!

1:00:31.295 --> 1:00:32.795
- Where are the Bauers?

1:00:32.796 --> 1:00:34.296
- I have 'em upstairs
under lock and key.

1:00:34.298 --> 1:00:35.631
- Fantastic.

1:00:41.171 --> 1:00:43.772
(straining)

1:00:44.908 --> 1:00:47.242
(coughing)

1:01:32.756 --> 1:01:35.824
(glass shattering)

1:01:37.361 --> 1:01:40.429
(glass shattering)

1:01:54.778 --> 1:01:57.846
(glass shattering)

1:02:01.785 --> 1:02:04.720
(slow breathing)

1:02:11.128 --> 1:02:14.996
(growing suspenseful music)

1:02:18.368 --> 1:02:20.869
(shouting)

1:02:29.046 --> 1:02:32.047
(glass shattering)

1:03:02.146 --> 1:03:03.111
- Oh my god.

1:03:04.848 --> 1:03:06.782
- Oh shit.

1:03:07.451 --> 1:03:08.717
What we do, Mickey?

1:03:08.718 --> 1:03:09.984
Tell us what we need to do!

1:03:12.156 --> 1:03:13.188
- Paulie.

1:03:13.190 --> 1:03:14.956
- Paulie; call Paulie.

1:03:15.793 --> 1:03:16.558
Okay, stay with him.

1:03:16.560 --> 1:03:17.776
Stay right there.

1:03:17.777 --> 1:03:18.993
I'll be right back, okay?

1:03:20.230 --> 1:03:21.329
I'll be right back.

1:03:22.966 --> 1:03:24.199
- I'm sorry, Mickey.

1:03:25.836 --> 1:03:30.906
I'm so sorry. (sobbing)

1:03:35.512 --> 1:03:37.012
- Jesus Christ.

1:03:37.014 --> 1:03:39.347
Paulie, Paulie, Paulie.

1:03:39.349 --> 1:03:40.348
Okay.

1:03:42.286 --> 1:03:43.985
Paulie: Mickey.

1:03:43.987 --> 1:03:47.222
- No, this isn't
Mickey, it's Ray Bauer.

1:03:47.224 --> 1:03:49.424
Paulie: Oh, hello, Mr. Bauer,
how can I help you today?

1:03:49.426 --> 1:03:51.593
- A woman, she came to kill us.

1:03:51.595 --> 1:03:52.894
We've met her before.

1:03:52.896 --> 1:03:55.030
Mickey, he's hurt real bad!

1:03:56.166 --> 1:03:57.032
Paulie: How bad?

1:03:57.034 --> 1:03:58.033
- Very.

1:03:58.035 --> 1:04:01.236
Paulie: All right, just lock
all the doors and stay put.

1:04:01.238 --> 1:04:02.571
I'll be there shortly.

1:04:02.572 --> 1:04:03.905
In the meantime, try to
get Mickey comfortable.

1:04:03.907 --> 1:04:05.524
- All right.

1:04:05.525 --> 1:04:07.142
Paulie: What happened
to the liaison?

1:04:07.144 --> 1:04:08.143
- Liaison?

1:04:09.112 --> 1:04:11.012
Mickey, he killed her.

1:04:14.852 --> 1:04:15.501
She's, she's dead.

1:04:15.502 --> 1:04:16.151
Paulie: All right,
I'll be right there.

1:04:16.153 --> 1:04:17.152
- Okay.

1:04:21.058 --> 1:04:24.159
(breathing rapidly)

1:04:25.629 --> 1:04:26.595
Fuck.

1:04:36.874 --> 1:04:37.539
Paulie: Ray.

1:04:37.541 --> 1:04:39.007
- Shit.

1:04:39.009 --> 1:04:40.242
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1:04:41.044 --> 1:04:42.143
- It's okay.

1:04:42.145 --> 1:04:43.311
You all right?

1:04:44.915 --> 1:04:45.914
Where's Mickey?

1:04:51.622 --> 1:04:53.288
- Camilla has him
in the other room.

1:04:53.290 --> 1:04:54.990
- Is she hurt?

1:04:54.992 --> 1:04:55.991
- I don't think so.

1:04:55.993 --> 1:04:56.992
- Good.

1:04:57.527 --> 1:04:58.560
Anyone else here?

1:05:00.364 --> 1:05:01.897
- No.

1:05:01.899 --> 1:05:02.898
- Good.

1:05:03.567 --> 1:05:05.033
Where's Laurie's body?

1:05:06.536 --> 1:05:08.103
- Lower level.

1:05:08.105 --> 1:05:09.104
- Okay.

1:05:10.340 --> 1:05:13.275
- On the phone, you knew
she was our liaison.

1:05:14.344 --> 1:05:15.310
- I did.

1:05:15.311 --> 1:05:16.277
- How did you know that?

1:05:16.280 --> 1:05:17.946
- Mickey told me.

1:05:17.948 --> 1:05:20.215
Said she'd be stopping
by today at some point.

1:05:20.217 --> 1:05:21.349
- No.
- Yeah.

1:05:21.351 --> 1:05:22.951
- He never woulda said that.

1:05:22.953 --> 1:05:24.286
- Why's that?

1:05:24.287 --> 1:05:25.620
- He didn't know
she was coming by.

1:05:26.590 --> 1:05:27.689
And...

1:05:27.691 --> 1:05:29.457
He doesn't trust you.

1:05:31.161 --> 1:05:32.928
- Come on.

1:05:32.930 --> 1:05:36.231
Mr. Bauer, why would
he tell you to call me?

1:05:40.337 --> 1:05:42.971
Get it together,
Mr. Bauer, okay?

1:05:42.973 --> 1:05:44.372
We have to get outta here.

1:05:44.374 --> 1:05:45.941
Where's the other bedroom?

1:05:50.681 --> 1:05:51.713
- It's this way.

1:05:51.715 --> 1:05:52.714
- Perfect.

1:06:08.598 --> 1:06:12.334
Mrs. Bauer, my name's Paulie.

1:06:12.336 --> 1:06:15.303
I'm here to get you and your
husband out of here safely.

1:06:16.206 --> 1:06:17.372
- Where's my husband?

1:06:20.544 --> 1:06:22.077
- Oh, right.

1:06:22.079 --> 1:06:23.979
He's in the other room.

1:06:23.981 --> 1:06:25.664
Don't worry about Mickey.

1:06:25.665 --> 1:06:27.348
Someone's gonna take
care of him, okay?

1:06:27.351 --> 1:06:28.316
Let's go.

1:06:29.720 --> 1:06:30.652
- Ray?

1:06:31.621 --> 1:06:32.587
Ray!

1:06:36.126 --> 1:06:37.392
- They said no guns.

1:06:40.731 --> 1:06:43.732
(Paulie laughing)

1:06:46.336 --> 1:06:49.337
(Camilla sobbing)

1:06:50.507 --> 1:06:51.773
No, no, no!

1:06:51.775 --> 1:06:53.141
No, no, no, no.

1:06:53.142 --> 1:06:54.508
Please tell me he isn't dead.

1:06:54.511 --> 1:06:55.510
- Not yet.

1:06:57.047 --> 1:06:59.014
And you won't be
for a while either.

1:07:01.018 --> 1:07:05.420
The Fratellis want their
money back, all of it.

1:07:07.090 --> 1:07:09.324
Your husband was messing
around with those accounts.

1:07:09.326 --> 1:07:10.492
- I don't understand.

1:07:15.565 --> 1:07:17.666
- Yeah you do.

1:07:17.667 --> 1:07:19.768
- You were supposed to be
a part of our protection.

1:07:19.770 --> 1:07:20.635
We paid you.

1:07:20.637 --> 1:07:21.636
- You paid me?

1:07:23.173 --> 1:07:24.172
No.

1:07:25.776 --> 1:07:28.510
The Fratellis are the
agency's biggest client.

1:07:28.512 --> 1:07:31.046
We've been on it
since the beginning.

1:07:31.048 --> 1:07:32.915
You think it was
just a coincidence

1:07:32.916 --> 1:07:34.783
that you got sent here
with someone like Mickey?

1:07:36.553 --> 1:07:38.620
- But he--
- He what?

1:07:38.622 --> 1:07:40.455
That fucking guy's
one scotch away

1:07:40.457 --> 1:07:42.057
from having a heart attack.

1:08:18.528 --> 1:08:19.527
I know.

1:08:22.232 --> 1:08:23.231
The fear.

1:08:24.434 --> 1:08:25.700
It's setting in, right?

1:08:27.504 --> 1:08:28.503
Knowing...

1:08:31.741 --> 1:08:33.741
That your life is
almost over, huh?

1:08:39.316 --> 1:08:40.415
I'll tell you what.

1:08:40.417 --> 1:08:44.853
I'll give you one
more selfless act.

1:08:46.656 --> 1:08:49.724
You tell me where the money is

1:08:52.662 --> 1:08:57.765
and I will make sure that
I kill your husband quick.

1:09:00.470 --> 1:09:01.936
Where is?

1:09:01.937 --> 1:09:03.403
Ray: What do you
consider quick, huh?

1:09:09.279 --> 1:09:11.613
(groaning)

1:09:19.856 --> 1:09:22.557
Camilla: You motherfucker!

1:09:24.427 --> 1:09:26.494
(Paulie yelling)

1:09:26.496 --> 1:09:28.830
- You fucking stupid bitch!

1:09:28.832 --> 1:09:31.332
(grunting)

1:09:34.704 --> 1:09:37.705
(Paulie laughing)

1:09:40.844 --> 1:09:43.244
I don't need both of you.

1:09:44.848 --> 1:09:47.315
(Mickey whistling)

1:09:47.317 --> 1:09:48.349
- Hey, dickless.

1:09:49.252 --> 1:09:51.719
(gun firing)

1:10:03.867 --> 1:10:05.934
That's what you get
for that mustache.

1:10:07.337 --> 1:10:11.873
- The Fratellis, the agency;
they used them, Mickey.

1:10:14.211 --> 1:10:16.377
- Probably sent me down
here to get me whacked too

1:10:16.379 --> 1:10:18.379
so they don't have
to pay my pension.

1:10:20.250 --> 1:10:21.883
- So, what do we do now, Mickey?

1:10:24.454 --> 1:10:26.654
- Always with the
questions with you, huh?

1:10:27.657 --> 1:10:29.891
I'll tell you what you do.

1:10:31.595 --> 1:10:33.895
(groaning)

1:10:33.897 --> 1:10:35.763
You have that money, right?

1:10:37.867 --> 1:10:39.934
You take your
mother, you vanish.

1:10:40.837 --> 1:10:43.338
New names, you get off the grid.

1:10:43.340 --> 1:10:44.839
It's gonna be your only shot.

1:10:46.743 --> 1:10:49.611
I know a guy, pay him well.

1:10:51.248 --> 1:10:52.580
He'll make you disappear.

1:10:53.583 --> 1:10:54.983
Camilla: And what about you?

1:10:58.021 --> 1:10:59.787
- Consider me retired.

1:11:00.690 --> 1:11:01.689
Oh, and Ray.

1:11:02.425 --> 1:11:03.892
- Yeah?

1:11:03.893 --> 1:11:05.360
- I'm gonna need
something from you.

1:11:06.930 --> 1:11:08.563
- Yeah, anything.

1:11:30.053 --> 1:11:31.286
- Yeah.

1:11:31.288 --> 1:11:32.420
Yeah, what?

1:11:34.958 --> 1:11:36.424
It's been a week.

1:11:37.394 --> 1:11:39.572
All right, four days.

1:11:39.573 --> 1:11:41.751
Don't get fucking cute with me!

1:11:41.752 --> 1:11:43.930
This shit does not happen in
this business, you understand?!

1:11:43.933 --> 1:11:45.400
It gives us a bad name!

1:11:45.402 --> 1:11:46.934
It makes us look bad!

1:11:47.737 --> 1:11:49.637
How the hell should I know?!

1:11:49.639 --> 1:11:53.474
He's probably lying in a
ditch somewhere, he's drunk.

1:11:53.476 --> 1:11:55.443
Probably doesn't even
know what's happening.

1:11:55.445 --> 1:11:56.844
Find the, find the--

1:11:56.846 --> 1:11:58.079
Would you just shut up for one--

1:11:58.081 --> 1:12:01.449
Find the couple and find him!

1:12:01.451 --> 1:12:03.084
And when you do find him,

1:12:03.085 --> 1:12:04.718
you put a bullet in
his fucking head!

1:12:05.789 --> 1:12:06.654
Fuck.

1:12:06.656 --> 1:12:07.655
Fuck!

1:12:09.459 --> 1:12:10.525
Hey, Mickey.

1:12:13.930 --> 1:12:16.030
- Here, I thought we
were friends, Carl.

1:12:17.701 --> 1:12:18.933
- Don't act fuckin' surprised.

1:12:18.935 --> 1:12:21.319
You know it is business.

1:12:21.320 --> 1:12:23.704
You know the kinda
people we work with.

1:12:23.707 --> 1:12:24.672
- No, I didn't.

1:12:24.674 --> 1:12:28.810
I thought we were doing good
most of the time, you know?

1:12:28.812 --> 1:12:31.012
Protecting people.
- Really?

1:12:31.014 --> 1:12:32.980
- I mean, I know you ran
collections every now and then,

1:12:32.982 --> 1:12:35.683
but I never put two
and two together.

1:12:35.685 --> 1:12:38.720
I didn't know you did
collections for the Fratellis.

1:12:38.722 --> 1:12:42.490
I mean, I'm smart, but
that one got by me.

1:12:43.493 --> 1:12:45.727
- You know they're
gonna come after you.

1:12:45.729 --> 1:12:47.562
You know they
won't let you live.

1:12:48.765 --> 1:12:50.898
- I don't think they're
gonna have much of a choice.

1:12:52.369 --> 1:12:54.736
See, a friend of mine gave
me this little black book

1:12:54.738 --> 1:12:59.006
and it has all these
names, dates, transactions,

1:12:59.776 --> 1:13:01.042
pretty much everything.

1:13:02.912 --> 1:13:04.479
Had he paid attention
to those names,

1:13:04.481 --> 1:13:06.047
he would've found
yours in there,

1:13:06.048 --> 1:13:07.614
but he didn't care
about that, did he?

1:13:07.617 --> 1:13:11.519
All he cared about was keeping
himself and his wife alive.

1:13:12.789 --> 1:13:14.789
Anyway, I gave that
book to the feds.

1:13:16.393 --> 1:13:18.493
So, I'd say your
friends, the Fratellis,

1:13:19.729 --> 1:13:22.430
I'd say they're getting
picked up right about now,

1:13:22.432 --> 1:13:23.898
along with their associates.

1:13:24.701 --> 1:13:26.251
Only a matter of time

1:13:26.252 --> 1:13:27.802
before they come knocking
on your door, Carl.

1:13:31.474 --> 1:13:32.874
- So, what do we do now?

1:13:34.110 --> 1:13:35.109
- I told you.

1:13:35.912 --> 1:13:37.445
Last job and I'm done.

1:13:40.817 --> 1:13:42.683
It was almost paradise, Carl,

1:13:45.555 --> 1:13:47.455
right down to the
goddamn coconut.

1:15:32.061 --> 1:15:33.895
(bright tropical music)

1:15:33.897 --> 1:15:35.596
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Bauer!

1:15:35.598 --> 1:15:37.999
Do you like getting
shot in the pool?

1:15:38.001 --> 1:15:40.234
Hello, Mr. And Mrs. Bauer!

1:15:40.236 --> 1:15:42.870
Do you like getting
shot in the pool?

1:15:42.872 --> 1:15:46.541
Yeah, right in the fuckin' head!

1:15:46.543 --> 1:15:49.810
- So, I'm gonna be
like, and that's when...

1:15:49.812 --> 1:15:52.079
- [Woman] Okay,
which line is this?

1:15:59.589 --> 1:16:02.723
(blowing raspberry)

1:16:03.960 --> 1:16:06.260
- Nice, buddy.
- Are you all right?

1:16:07.297 --> 1:16:08.563
- This is gonna be
the nostril shot.

1:16:08.565 --> 1:16:10.865
(crew laughing)

1:16:10.867 --> 1:16:12.233
- [Director] I still hear
some kind of fan running

1:16:12.235 --> 1:16:13.834
if anyone's nearby.

1:16:13.836 --> 1:16:16.103
- It's definitely a fan.

1:16:16.105 --> 1:16:17.872
There is definitely a fan.

1:16:17.874 --> 1:16:19.574
- Is this beard new?

1:16:19.576 --> 1:16:20.742
- What the fuck?

1:16:20.743 --> 1:16:21.909
Hey, you know what happened?

1:16:21.911 --> 1:16:23.744
I got a proctology exam.

1:16:23.746 --> 1:16:25.079
It's the third time that
I'm having it right now.

1:16:25.081 --> 1:16:27.114
- Is it?
- Absolutely.

1:16:27.116 --> 1:16:29.584
I'd rather have my ass
checked out every day

1:16:29.586 --> 1:16:34.722
than to walk into--
(drowned out by music).

1:16:35.158 --> 1:16:37.592
Holding onto me, still.

1:16:37.594 --> 1:16:39.827
- You'd rather have your
ass checked every day?

1:16:39.829 --> 1:16:41.963
- Every day, with a cattle prod.

1:16:41.965 --> 1:16:42.997
- By?

1:16:42.999 --> 1:16:44.165
- Everyone.

1:16:44.167 --> 1:16:45.032
- Everyone?

1:16:45.034 --> 1:16:46.334
- The world.

1:16:46.336 --> 1:16:47.201
- All day long?

1:16:47.203 --> 1:16:48.336
- Every day.

1:16:49.138 --> 1:16:50.738
- I love you.

1:16:50.740 --> 1:16:53.941
Oh, it's so good
to see you, Mick.

1:16:53.943 --> 1:16:55.876
- Get off of me.

1:16:55.878 --> 1:16:57.645
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:16:57.647 --> 1:16:58.746
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1:16:58.748 --> 1:17:00.548
- Yeah.

1:17:00.549 --> 1:17:02.349
(Mickey growling)

1:17:05.021 --> 1:17:08.022
- [Director] (inaudible)

1:17:08.024 --> 1:17:10.891
- Well, at least it won't smell.

1:17:12.862 --> 1:17:15.062
These fuckin' vines.

1:17:15.064 --> 1:17:16.998
Lots of vines.

1:17:16.999 --> 1:17:18.933
How many motorcycle
accidents are there a year?

1:17:18.935 --> 1:17:20.390
A day?

1:17:20.391 --> 1:17:21.846
How many motorcycle
accidents are there in a day?

1:17:21.847 --> 1:17:23.302
A lot; I betcha a lot.

1:17:23.306 --> 1:17:24.772
Why is everybody on
their cell phones?

1:17:24.774 --> 1:17:26.641
They should be working.

1:17:26.643 --> 1:17:27.742
Making some money.

1:17:28.645 --> 1:17:30.177
What the fuck?

1:17:30.179 --> 1:17:31.779
Jesus Christ!

1:17:31.781 --> 1:17:33.147
Is there clean water here?

1:17:33.149 --> 1:17:34.915
You got clean water, right?

1:17:34.917 --> 1:17:36.384
This isn't a smooth ride.

1:17:38.388 --> 1:17:40.154
Jesus Christ.

1:17:41.190 --> 1:17:43.174
I have a neck, you know.

1:17:43.175 --> 1:17:45.159
Hopefully, whoever you have
in the back isn't breakable

1:17:45.161 --> 1:17:46.661
because something broke.

1:17:48.698 --> 1:17:49.897
It's not my fault.

1:17:49.899 --> 1:17:51.999
My hemorrhoids just popped out.

1:17:52.001 --> 1:17:53.885
How much further do we got?

1:17:53.886 --> 1:17:55.770
Why do I feel like
I'm talking to myself?

1:17:56.873 --> 1:17:59.040
'Cause I am talking to myself.

1:17:59.042 --> 1:18:00.441
- [Crew Member] Take one, mark.

1:18:00.443 --> 1:18:02.276
- Where'd that wind come from?

1:18:02.278 --> 1:18:04.145
- [Director] Action!

1:18:06.449 --> 1:18:07.865
Look what happened.

1:18:07.866 --> 1:18:09.282
- [Laurie] Sorry, no, I forgot--

1:18:09.285 --> 1:18:10.963
- They're gonna decorate

1:18:10.964 --> 1:18:12.642
their next Christmas tree--
(muttering offscreen)

1:18:12.643 --> 1:18:14.321
- [Man] What?

1:18:14.323 --> 1:18:15.823
What?

1:18:15.825 --> 1:18:16.974
- Is that gunshots?

1:18:16.975 --> 1:18:18.124
What is that, did you hear that?

1:18:18.127 --> 1:18:19.860
- Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Bauer.

1:18:19.862 --> 1:18:22.463
Do you like getting
shot in the pool?

1:18:22.465 --> 1:18:23.931
Yes.

1:18:23.933 --> 1:18:25.800
- [Director] Action.

1:18:32.108 --> 1:18:33.107
Let's go back.

1:20:25.121 --> 1:20:27.321
(sighing)

1:20:28.357 --> 1:20:30.591
- I think you should
take the medication.

1:20:35.498 --> 1:20:37.898
- Just give me
the goddamn pills.

1:20:41.571 --> 1:20:42.570
Don't touch me.

1:20:44.473 --> 1:20:45.472
I hate you.
