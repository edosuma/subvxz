00:48.481 --> 00:50.182
My name...

00:55.288 --> 00:58.090
My name is Riley...

01:02.695 --> 01:05.263
My name is Riley Connors.

01:06.533 --> 01:09.601
And my father was a us marine.

01:16.709 --> 01:18.243
Fuck.

01:24.517 --> 01:27.119
My name is Riley Connors.

01:29.089 --> 01:32.257
And my father was a us marine.

01:33.526 --> 01:37.596
My first doll was a gi Joe

01:37.598 --> 01:41.300
and until today,
i was an analyst for the CIA.

02:09.696 --> 02:11.864
-Bill.
-Yeah.

02:14.767 --> 02:17.402
Nothing. Never mind.

02:17.404 --> 02:18.837
Still on for dinner tomorrow?

02:22.675 --> 02:25.277
-Mm-hmm.
-Good luck saving the world.

02:25.279 --> 02:26.745
Can't wait for tomorrow.

02:48.234 --> 02:49.902
They're not watching you.

02:51.437 --> 02:52.704
They're watching everyone.

03:01.347 --> 03:03.815
For two years,
i ran a surveillance team

03:03.817 --> 03:06.285
on select us citizens.

03:09.622 --> 03:11.957
We never required a warrant,
and none of these people

03:11.959 --> 03:14.660
have ever been charged
with a crime.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.198
Yet, we watched them.

03:21.768 --> 03:24.303
I watched them...

03:25.572 --> 03:27.472
At their jobs

03:27.474 --> 03:30.909
at their homes,
in their bedrooms

03:30.911 --> 03:33.612
and I won't watch any longer.

03:43.756 --> 03:48.360
Today, I released evidence
of government spying

03:48.362 --> 03:49.795
and illegal surveillance

03:49.797 --> 03:52.264
committed against
these us citizens.

03:54.500 --> 03:57.369
My name is Riley Connors.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.673
You deserve the truth.

04:01.675 --> 04:04.009
What you do with it
is up to you.

04:10.985 --> 04:13.518
It's okay. You did great.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.020
Trust me.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.721
You'll be a hero by tomorrow.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.529
You're doing the right thing.

04:29.602 --> 04:32.671
My name is Riley Connors.

04:35.375 --> 04:36.608
You deserve the truth.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.977
What you do with it
is up to you.

04:41.914 --> 04:44.650
Whistleblower, a traitor
according to the vice

04:44.652 --> 04:46.785
or a former vice-president,
in any event.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.421
Everyone seems so empowered
to stick it to her.

04:49.423 --> 04:52.591
I just hope they're not in some
sort of surveillance...

05:00.600 --> 05:03.669
These disclosures have caused
significant harm to our nation

05:03.671 --> 05:05.404
and to our safety.

05:08.941 --> 05:11.710
The American people look at us
and and asks us, "keep us safe."

05:11.712 --> 05:13.445
She betrayed her country.
Now, she's a traitor.

05:13.447 --> 05:14.646
No, she's not a traitor.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.449
Riley Connors
is keeping America safe.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.584
Safe from our own
tyrannical government.

05:19.586 --> 05:21.053
According to a reuters poll

05:21.055 --> 05:22.654
23% of Americans think

05:22.656 --> 05:24.356
Riley Connors is a traitor.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.325
Thirty one percent think
she's a patriot.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.876
What are you doing?

05:44.878 --> 05:46.812
Haven't you been listening?

05:46.814 --> 05:48.647
What are you talking about?

05:48.649 --> 05:52.751
Estelle, we're going to win,
just like you said.

05:52.753 --> 05:53.952
What?

05:55.555 --> 05:56.922
Oh, my god.

05:57.990 --> 05:59.958
I'm so sorry.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.893
Everything went wrong.

06:08.634 --> 06:10.502
The homemade explosive
detonated

06:10.504 --> 06:13.972
on a public transit bus
just hours ago.

06:13.974 --> 06:17.676
Authorities have named
rob temmons, a city bus driver

06:17.678 --> 06:20.812
for more than eight years, as
the perpetrator of this attack

06:20.814 --> 06:23.648
which took his own life
along with 16 others.

06:23.650 --> 06:26.551
Sixteen people?

06:26.553 --> 06:29.454
And one of the names
released just a few weeks ago

06:29.456 --> 06:33.992
by the notorious CIA
whistleblower, Riley Connors.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.560
This is impossible.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.496
... scene with investigators.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.831
It's unclear at this time if
Ms. Connors was a part of this

06:39.833 --> 06:43.034
act of terror
or if she just failed to see...

06:43.036 --> 06:44.903
You're in a private flight
to Columbia.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.172
Find this address
as soon as you arrive.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.040
He's my brother.

06:49.042 --> 06:52.911
He'll look out for you
till we can figure this out.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.514
We need to go, okay? You're not
safe here anymore, Riley.

06:55.516 --> 06:58.016
Please. You understand?

08:09.555 --> 08:11.523
-Come on.
-Cheer up.

08:11.525 --> 08:12.858
You'll go home someday.

08:22.068 --> 08:24.069
Not unless I'm behind bars.

08:26.005 --> 08:29.207
At least you're from a place
where people are prosecuted

08:29.209 --> 08:31.676
not just taken away
during the night.

08:36.782 --> 08:38.116
Estelle's in town.

08:39.652 --> 08:41.886
The usual place.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.856
Thanks. Go finish your rally.

08:54.166 --> 08:55.967
You should come.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.303
Find something new to stand for.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.639
Just tell estelle
I'll be there.

09:38.644 --> 09:41.212
You changed your hair again.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.949
I only have a few hours
until my next shift.

09:45.651 --> 09:48.153
You can find a better job.

09:48.155 --> 09:50.155
And end my penance so early?

09:51.757 --> 09:54.359
You'd love this country
if you ever impact.

09:56.362 --> 09:59.264
Were you able to talk to bill?

09:59.266 --> 10:01.132
He won't meet with me.

10:03.970 --> 10:06.638
I kept him in the dark
to protect him.

10:08.140 --> 10:11.343
I know. He might need more time.

10:11.345 --> 10:13.745
I'm only asking for a few words.

10:13.747 --> 10:16.781
Even if they're
"go fuck yourself"

10:16.783 --> 10:19.217
at least I'd know
i-i still exist to him.

10:19.219 --> 10:24.222
I brought you to Columbia, to my
home because here it's safe.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.324
You can start over.

10:26.326 --> 10:30.028
I'd rather go to prison than
spend another day in this hell.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.330
They'll send you
to Guantanamo, Riley.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.067
Temmons hand washed his uniform

10:36.069 --> 10:37.736
every night after work,
and then just went--

10:37.738 --> 10:39.337
stop it.

10:39.339 --> 10:42.407
I mean, how does someone like
that just sleep so easily?

10:42.409 --> 10:44.976
Show me the video, I missed
of him planning his attack

10:44.978 --> 10:46.945
breaking the law,
and I'd know I'd screwed up

10:46.947 --> 10:49.247
but he didn't do anything,
he did nothing

10:49.249 --> 10:51.316
until I put his name
on CNN and--

10:51.318 --> 10:53.084
people have moved on
from that story

10:53.086 --> 10:54.819
and you should do the same.

10:56.656 --> 10:57.856
Wow.

10:59.892 --> 11:02.961
It was never
a story to me, estelle.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.896
Okay.

11:04.898 --> 11:09.100
Listen, I opened you
a bank account.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.670
There is money in it
to get you sorted.

11:12.838 --> 11:15.707
-Pity?
-No. A life.

11:15.709 --> 11:18.309
And a part of me
can't move on until you do.

11:25.951 --> 11:27.686
Estelle.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.026
Senora Connors?

13:20.065 --> 13:21.332
Riley!

13:22.334 --> 13:24.002
Riley.

13:34.346 --> 13:37.182
How did you find me?

13:37.184 --> 13:39.117
Your friend from the times
is a lot easier

13:39.119 --> 13:41.085
to track than you are.

13:50.095 --> 13:52.363
You owe me a new door, asshole.

13:56.435 --> 14:01.206
Pascal's my liaison down here.
He can be a little overeager.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.107
You're a field agent now?

14:03.109 --> 14:05.944
A lot has changed in two years.
I'm here on assignment.

14:08.047 --> 14:10.181
-To bring me in.
-No.

14:12.117 --> 14:14.052
I think I have a way
to help you.

14:15.154 --> 14:16.487
Get you home.

14:29.068 --> 14:31.603
Riley, I found you
an opportunity.

14:31.605 --> 14:32.904
You need
a presidential pardon

14:32.906 --> 14:34.939
but you got to work with me.

14:34.941 --> 14:36.374
No more secrets.

14:37.877 --> 14:41.546
-Bill, what I did--
-i know, ry.

14:43.482 --> 14:46.050
Let's just put one foot
in front of the other, okay?

14:48.988 --> 14:50.355
I'm listening.

14:52.424 --> 14:55.393
I'm here on a co-op with
the columbian national police.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.897
These...

15:00.266 --> 15:02.233
Are the ruiz brothers.

15:05.906 --> 15:08.039
That's Fernando,
the younger brother.

15:09.675 --> 15:11.676
He did a short stint
in the Cuban secret police

15:11.678 --> 15:13.544
before migrating to Columbia

15:13.546 --> 15:16.147
working his way up
in mid-level corporations.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.355
The older one's carlito.

15:24.357 --> 15:25.957
A rising star
in the secret police

15:25.959 --> 15:28.459
before he left Castro
with his baby brother.

15:28.461 --> 15:31.596
He handles the physical side
of the business.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.064
Fernando's our key.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.098
He operates the largest

15:34.100 --> 15:35.199
boutique banking network

15:35.201 --> 15:36.935
in south America.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.703
How does he get me home?

15:38.705 --> 15:40.271
Turns out the banks
aren't Fernando's

15:40.273 --> 15:42.440
only source of income.

15:42.442 --> 15:45.343
He also owns a piece
of computer gaming site.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.078
Next wave play.

15:47.080 --> 15:51.149
Millions of us members, very
lucrative, completely illegal.

15:51.151 --> 15:54.719
The CIA doesn't police
virtual gaming.

15:54.721 --> 15:57.021
It does when there's millions of
dollars and illegally laundered

15:57.023 --> 15:58.690
money funds domestic terrorists.

15:58.692 --> 16:02.193
Director thinks Fernando's banks
are top financial creditor.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.162
Thinks or knows?

16:04.164 --> 16:06.464
Right now
it's all circumstantial.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.500
We need bank records, accounts,
proof of transfers.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.436
We can't hack him,
and we haven't been able

16:11.438 --> 16:15.073
to get anyone inside until now.

16:32.291 --> 16:34.025
This is the op-center.

16:39.231 --> 16:42.333
It's a basic set-up, but we're
a small team, so it works.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.602
We've got audiovisual
outside the bank.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.404
Here, I'll show you.

16:55.514 --> 17:00.785
I'm not a field agent.
I'm not even an analyst anymore.

17:00.787 --> 17:04.155
Exactly, but you're in.
It's a great cover.

17:04.156 --> 17:06.457
Even the director admitted
you're perfect for the job.

17:06.459 --> 17:10.194
Mm, because I'm expendable.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.563
If this works,
maybe I get a ticket home.

17:12.565 --> 17:15.098
If not, one less CIA traitor
out there.

17:15.101 --> 17:17.101
Agency wins, either way.

17:19.137 --> 17:20.771
It's the only way
i can get you home.

17:23.208 --> 17:26.277
No more watching
from a cubicle, Riley.

17:26.279 --> 17:29.814
You can look this asshole
in the eye and take him down.

17:31.316 --> 17:33.217
Not everyone
gets a second chance.

17:36.121 --> 17:38.122
Not everyone deserves one.

17:39.691 --> 17:41.225
You do.

17:42.361 --> 17:43.594
We both do.

17:49.701 --> 17:50.835
Okay.

18:18.297 --> 18:20.364
My name is Riley Connors.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.768
My name is Riley Connors.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.205
My name is Riley...

18:27.207 --> 18:28.606
You're doing
that thing where you

18:28.608 --> 18:30.475
say your name to yourself?

18:34.680 --> 18:36.380
You look good.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.487
That's not what
I'm worried about.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.892
I barely know anything
about this guy and...

18:50.762 --> 18:53.865
-I don't trust myself anymore.
-Then trust me.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.536
Forget about the past.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.338
You have a future
to fight for again.

19:02.174 --> 19:03.774
My future or ours?

19:05.344 --> 19:08.346
Uh, I'm sorry.

19:08.348 --> 19:10.381
I don't deserve to ask that,
i shouldn't have...

19:10.383 --> 19:12.517
You, um...

19:12.519 --> 19:14.852
You say what's on your mind.
That's what I love about you.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.525
Bill...

19:21.727 --> 19:23.261
What I did...

19:24.530 --> 19:26.664
You don't think it was right,
do you?

19:31.436 --> 19:34.372
I think you have a chance
to do the right thing...

19:35.874 --> 19:37.408
This time.

19:54.793 --> 19:57.461
My name is Riley Connors.

19:57.463 --> 19:59.964
Your fortune and your freedom
are in danger.

20:02.334 --> 20:03.801
And you need my help.

20:05.604 --> 20:07.939
I agreed to a meeting
because of your name

20:07.941 --> 20:14.345
but... to employ you
with no resume

20:14.347 --> 20:16.647
no real cybersecurity
experience...

20:17.683 --> 20:19.283
It is difficult.

20:20.852 --> 20:24.355
Would you say that the CIA
is cyber secure?

20:25.724 --> 20:27.725
We get CNN in Bogota.

20:27.727 --> 20:32.263
-Then you know my resume.
-Mm-hmm. Yes.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.365
And why no one
will ever hire you.

20:36.735 --> 20:39.704
Plus, I have a head of security.

20:42.541 --> 20:46.344
Do you use packet filter
or a circuit gateway firewalls?

20:48.780 --> 20:51.349
Carlito won't speak to you.

20:52.284 --> 20:53.851
Because I'm a woman?

20:55.754 --> 20:59.423
Because he puts his children on
a bus to school every morning.

21:02.427 --> 21:05.029
But we don't see eye to eye
on everything.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.665
I believe your actions
were quite brave.

21:11.036 --> 21:15.039
-Is carlito a good bodyguard?
-I am here.

21:15.041 --> 21:18.342
Thanks only to god
and my brother.

21:19.845 --> 21:22.647
And has carlito
ever been shot?

21:29.488 --> 21:32.490
I bet it hurt, but you're damn
good at your job

21:32.492 --> 21:34.292
because you know that pain

21:34.294 --> 21:36.560
and it's your job to protect
your brother from it.

21:37.696 --> 21:39.297
I've never been shot

21:39.299 --> 21:41.999
but I have felt more pain
than most can bear

21:42.001 --> 21:44.435
and I can protect you,
your company

21:44.437 --> 21:47.538
and your fortune from that pain.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.940
You already have government
agencies threatening you

21:49.942 --> 21:51.742
probably for mistakes.

21:51.744 --> 21:54.612
I've beat the CIA once.

21:54.614 --> 21:56.914
Now, you can pay me
to do it again.

21:58.016 --> 21:59.850
What threats?

21:59.852 --> 22:01.752
Well, we can start
with the ones watching

22:01.754 --> 22:03.587
from across the street.

22:03.589 --> 22:05.389
I spotted them
when I came this morning.

22:05.391 --> 22:08.526
Fifth floor,
second office on the left.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.761
-What is she doing?
-Gaining their trust.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.463
Didn't know it was going to be
at our expense.

22:17.402 --> 22:19.437
How did you know that?

22:19.439 --> 22:21.806
There's always someone watching.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.874
The hard part
is finding out who.

22:26.779 --> 22:28.412
And how to stop them.

22:40.659 --> 22:44.562
Perhaps it's time
for a new perspective.

22:46.131 --> 22:47.665
Very good.

23:03.915 --> 23:07.952
Do you believe god forgives us
for our mistakes?

23:09.087 --> 23:10.921
God didn't make the mistake.

23:13.859 --> 23:18.729
Carlito and I served
on Castro's police.

23:20.432 --> 23:22.800
To leave was to desert

23:22.802 --> 23:24.702
to be labeled traitors.

23:26.538 --> 23:29.006
You understand
the gravity of this?

23:29.008 --> 23:30.541
You know I do.

23:32.144 --> 23:35.179
But we made a new home here,
a new life... in Bogota.

23:39.618 --> 23:41.419
What that man did...

23:43.455 --> 23:44.955
Was terrible.

23:47.159 --> 23:50.961
What you did... wasn't.

23:58.870 --> 24:00.504
Thank you, hermano.

24:01.907 --> 24:03.741
Carlito needs to check you in.

24:11.650 --> 24:13.451
A pleasure, senorita.

24:24.729 --> 24:28.199
So what? You need my birthday?

24:35.540 --> 24:38.209
Remove all metals
and your clothes.

24:38.211 --> 24:41.212
Okay, Castro, i-I'm sorry
if I embarrassed you

24:41.214 --> 24:43.113
in front of your brother.

24:48.186 --> 24:50.855
Will you at least turn around
while I get naked?

24:57.562 --> 24:59.563
Okay, asshole.

25:46.645 --> 25:48.178
Riley?

25:50.081 --> 25:53.017
Wow. It's beautiful.

25:57.088 --> 25:59.690
You, uh,
trying to kill yourself?

26:01.126 --> 26:03.794
Second time couldn't hurt
much more, right?

26:06.164 --> 26:07.932
What happened there today?

26:09.568 --> 26:11.569
I had to give him something.

26:11.571 --> 26:14.738
Something that made you a little
less expendable to the CIA.

26:18.043 --> 26:20.811
And after, your Mike cut out.

26:22.881 --> 26:25.816
I had to ditch it.
Should we get back?

26:25.818 --> 26:28.018
Don't put me in the dark again.

26:29.788 --> 26:32.756
Bill,
if I had told you my plan...

26:32.758 --> 26:35.092
You'd be on the run too
or-or worse.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.761
It's not that you didn't tell me

26:37.763 --> 26:40.598
it's that you didn't
say anything at all.

26:40.600 --> 26:44.201
That day,
you were just so... normal.

26:46.805 --> 26:48.305
I'm so sorry.

26:49.808 --> 26:53.377
Then why? Why did you do it?

26:53.379 --> 26:57.715
Why throw away our life together
for people you don't even know?

26:57.717 --> 27:00.217
Do you really want to know
the answer to that?

27:00.219 --> 27:01.785
I think I've earned it.

27:04.389 --> 27:07.891
I wanted to join the agency
my whole life.

27:09.294 --> 27:11.962
It was my dream
to protect people.

27:12.731 --> 27:13.998
And I got it.

27:14.866 --> 27:16.700
I got my dream.

27:18.303 --> 27:22.973
And then one day
i wake up, and I'm the enemy?

27:22.975 --> 27:26.410
I'm the breath on the other end
of the phone line, so I...

27:26.412 --> 27:28.312
I tried to fix it.

27:35.186 --> 27:36.854
And, bill, I...

27:38.423 --> 27:40.324
I'd do it again.

27:44.929 --> 27:47.164
We were going to have a life.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.365
-Remember?
-Don't you think I know that?

27:48.367 --> 27:50.968
So you just didn't give a fuck?

27:50.970 --> 27:53.437
There isn't a day that goes by
that I don't think about

27:53.439 --> 27:57.241
what we lost,
and how to get it back.

28:00.812 --> 28:02.246
Will you look at me?

28:04.315 --> 28:06.083
Bill.

29:16.855 --> 29:18.789
I wasn't handed
this assignment...

29:20.391 --> 29:22.192
But I fought for it.

29:24.062 --> 29:25.929
To find you.

30:05.937 --> 30:08.138
The ruiz brothers.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.307
You know, they were
Cuban secret police, don't you?

30:11.309 --> 30:13.977
Yeah, they didn't hide it.

30:13.979 --> 30:15.512
You know what that means, right?

30:17.048 --> 30:19.416
He deserted.

30:19.418 --> 30:22.119
He didn't leave Castro
to reject dictatorship.

30:22.121 --> 30:24.888
He just wanted to be
the one in charge.

30:24.890 --> 30:28.325
Riley, the guys
was in the fucking narcos.

30:28.327 --> 30:31.295
Uh, I can't explain it, but...

30:33.097 --> 30:35.399
Fernando...

30:35.401 --> 30:36.967
He wasn't evil.

30:42.407 --> 30:44.074
Didn't seem evil?

30:45.009 --> 30:46.610
Medellin, 2008.

30:46.612 --> 30:48.445
Fernando tried
to purchase a local bank

30:48.447 --> 30:50.013
they resisted.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.317
They were burned alive.

30:56.921 --> 30:58.522
Fernando did this?

30:59.123 --> 31:00.557
Yes.

31:04.295 --> 31:07.064
All the more reason
i have to go after him.

31:07.066 --> 31:09.867
No, reason enough
to stay away from him.

31:09.869 --> 31:12.603
-This is how I get home.
-No, it's not.

31:12.605 --> 31:14.471
You're just
trying to redeem yourself

31:14.473 --> 31:16.640
and it doesn't work like that.

31:16.642 --> 31:20.911
And the CIA,
they'll use you and dump you.

31:20.913 --> 31:23.580
Maybe. But I trust bill.

31:52.577 --> 31:54.244
Morning.

31:57.615 --> 32:00.183
-Last night--
-hey.

32:00.185 --> 32:02.920
One foot in front of the other.

32:02.922 --> 32:04.121
Right?

32:05.490 --> 32:07.291
I'm going to need
to get this guy first.

32:08.993 --> 32:10.193
Same team?

32:11.329 --> 32:12.963
Same team.

32:22.640 --> 32:25.108
We don't have to be enemies.

32:35.687 --> 32:38.121
He probably just wants money.

33:54.198 --> 33:56.400
You're getting this?

33:56.402 --> 33:59.469
Okay, we have access
to the onboard computer.

33:59.471 --> 34:01.772
As soon as Fernando
links his mobile to the car

34:01.774 --> 34:04.541
we'll be tracking
and recording every key stroke.

34:07.345 --> 34:09.346
We're good. Disconnect.

34:11.681 --> 34:13.516
Riley?

34:13.518 --> 34:14.684
Riley.

34:18.656 --> 34:20.056
Riley.

34:24.495 --> 34:26.329
Done.

34:32.770 --> 34:36.373
-All okay?
-Yeah. These people are just...

34:36.375 --> 34:39.076
Good work, ry.
We own his ass.

34:41.079 --> 34:43.179
Not a bad start.

34:45.850 --> 34:47.250
Ry?

34:48.518 --> 34:50.087
Ry?

35:12.510 --> 35:14.678
You're sure this was the man?

35:16.247 --> 35:17.647
Positive.

35:19.250 --> 35:21.551
So, what are you hiding,
Mr. ruiz?

35:21.553 --> 35:23.520
Nando, please.

35:24.789 --> 35:27.457
And they are secrets
for a reason.

35:29.694 --> 35:33.130
In Cuba, Ms. Riley

35:34.599 --> 35:36.766
we knew
when not to ask questions.

35:39.237 --> 35:42.639
If the CIA even thinks
you're a threat

35:42.641 --> 35:45.175
they'll seize your business,
seize your money

35:45.177 --> 35:46.643
and send you back to Cuba.

35:47.612 --> 35:49.279
Do you want that?

35:54.585 --> 35:56.753
My banks hold money
for a large company.

35:56.755 --> 35:58.588
-Fernando.
-Ec.

36:01.492 --> 36:03.293
It's an online casino.

36:03.295 --> 36:05.829
Legal here in Colombia.

36:05.831 --> 36:08.365
But most of this money
comes from the states.

36:09.767 --> 36:12.369
My bank simply makes sure
that money appears

36:12.371 --> 36:15.539
to come from other places.

36:15.541 --> 36:18.742
-And where does the money go?
-It doesn't matter.

36:18.744 --> 36:21.311
The CIA will already be
tracking transfers.

36:21.313 --> 36:23.680
We need to rebuild
your firewall from the ground up

36:23.682 --> 36:25.515
and check
each server individually.

36:25.517 --> 36:28.518
Bill's probably already
mauled in to your accounts.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.388
Bill?

36:34.292 --> 36:35.659
Yes.

36:35.661 --> 36:37.827
Is that his name?

36:37.829 --> 36:39.296
Yes.

36:40.364 --> 36:42.199
How do you know this?

36:44.802 --> 36:48.738
As you say, "some things
are secrets for a reason."

36:52.577 --> 36:55.845
You work with carlito
on every step.

36:55.847 --> 36:58.782
And please
end this bill problem.

37:03.988 --> 37:05.589
Riley...

37:12.363 --> 37:15.632
I can make your life very
comfortable in Colombia.

37:17.768 --> 37:21.304
You can be someone
of importance here.

37:21.306 --> 37:22.572
Respected...

37:24.275 --> 37:25.942
As you should be.

37:39.457 --> 37:42.425
In addition to your password,
you'll need to scan in

37:42.427 --> 37:45.295
every time you
want to open the account.

37:45.297 --> 37:48.331
I will also set this up
on nando's phone

37:48.333 --> 37:51.468
so he can access
the server remotely.

37:52.336 --> 37:54.938
Nando?

37:54.940 --> 37:59.342
For a crusader, you get in bed
easily with the enemy.

37:59.344 --> 38:02.412
I lost my crusade.

38:02.414 --> 38:04.681
Now, it's just about the money.

38:06.784 --> 38:10.553
Without loyalty, we are nothing.

38:25.002 --> 38:27.437
-You ditched your Mike again.
-Shh, shh, shh.

38:50.027 --> 38:52.429
He's logging into the account.

39:13.617 --> 39:15.385
We have his print.

39:15.387 --> 39:17.387
And his password.

39:54.959 --> 39:57.961
We got you, puta. We got you.

39:59.163 --> 40:02.399
Looks like
I'm headed to the hacienda.

40:02.401 --> 40:03.933
Can I get a minute?

40:08.906 --> 40:12.909
-What the hell was that?
-I'm earning his trust.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.745
You're supposed to be doing that
with your skill, not your ass.

40:16.847 --> 40:18.047
Hmm.

40:19.083 --> 40:21.484
I'm sorry. It's just...

40:21.486 --> 40:23.186
You're doing it again.

40:23.188 --> 40:25.455
It's not like that.

40:25.457 --> 40:26.856
I'm with you.

40:27.725 --> 40:29.893
Same team. Right?

40:32.696 --> 40:34.664
Where did you go last night?

40:34.666 --> 40:37.534
-Was it to see him?
-Uh, no, of course not.

40:37.536 --> 40:39.803
Then who?

40:39.805 --> 40:41.604
Talk to me, trust me for once.

40:41.606 --> 40:43.072
I do.

40:44.642 --> 40:47.510
I'm with you. I promise.

40:59.957 --> 41:02.091
-I love the color so much.
-Yeah?

41:02.093 --> 41:04.194
-Yeah.
-It's too white.

41:05.797 --> 41:08.131
-Easy. Tranquila.
-Hey, hey.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.033
Mm, hmm. Shh, shh, shh.

41:10.035 --> 41:11.067
You hungry?

41:19.610 --> 41:20.810
Hey.

41:21.645 --> 41:23.213
Hey.

41:23.215 --> 41:26.182
Hey, hey, hey.
Unh-unh. Unh-unh.

41:27.084 --> 41:28.751
Gracias.

41:28.753 --> 41:31.888
I haven't been horse riding
since I was a kid, you know?

41:31.890 --> 41:34.991
Really?
You showed little rust.

41:36.194 --> 41:37.660
Now, no more.

41:41.532 --> 41:43.933
Thank you for this weekend.

41:43.935 --> 41:46.636
It's my pleasure. It's been fun.

41:47.638 --> 41:49.706
It has.

41:49.708 --> 41:53.676
Even carlito
is warming up to you.

41:55.246 --> 41:57.013
Let's not jump the gun.

41:58.549 --> 42:01.117
Carlito was a big man
in the police, Riley.

42:01.119 --> 42:02.886
A big man.

42:02.888 --> 42:05.255
I'm ashamed to say...

42:05.257 --> 42:08.157
I was not so successful.

42:11.562 --> 42:14.564
There was too much
brutality in that job.

42:14.566 --> 42:16.900
If you couldn't do it...

42:16.902 --> 42:19.669
Your comrades
beat those skills into you.

42:21.005 --> 42:22.205
Hmm.

42:23.307 --> 42:25.241
But no matter
how much I tried...

42:26.577 --> 42:28.077
I could not do it.

42:30.581 --> 42:34.217
I don't think that's anything
to be ashamed of.

42:34.219 --> 42:36.719
It is in Cuba.

42:36.721 --> 42:40.623
I am here because carlito
gave up everything

42:40.625 --> 42:42.625
to rescue me from that hell.

42:45.095 --> 42:49.332
My brother saved me
before the job could change me.

42:54.071 --> 42:56.973
But he served for much longer.

43:00.077 --> 43:02.111
And it changed him.

43:06.283 --> 43:09.319
Did you ever have a dog?

43:09.321 --> 43:11.287
Yes, I did.

43:11.289 --> 43:13.656
I had one when I was a kid.

43:16.226 --> 43:17.994
Carlito is like a pit bull

43:17.996 --> 43:19.829
bred for the cages.

43:20.831 --> 43:22.065
Beaten.

43:23.133 --> 43:24.968
Taught only to kill.

43:26.370 --> 43:28.037
I was lucky.

43:31.675 --> 43:33.610
But god never sent
carlito a brother

43:33.612 --> 43:35.178
strong enough to save him.

43:39.817 --> 43:41.384
I wonder sometimes

43:41.386 --> 43:44.320
if he can tell the difference
between right and wrong.

43:46.724 --> 43:50.026
We all struggle... with that

43:50.028 --> 43:51.694
I think.

44:12.349 --> 44:15.885
-To new beginnings.
-To new beginnings.

44:15.887 --> 44:17.353
To new beginnings.

45:15.245 --> 45:17.313
He believes god protects him.

45:26.924 --> 45:28.424
The scars?

45:30.828 --> 45:32.395
Cuban education.

45:35.933 --> 45:38.134
I'm sorry,
i just saw the light on.

45:39.236 --> 45:40.737
It's okay.

45:42.973 --> 45:44.373
Is there anything you need?

45:46.944 --> 45:48.444
No, I'm fine.

45:52.216 --> 45:53.416
Goodnight.

45:54.284 --> 45:55.985
Goodnight.

46:54.478 --> 46:56.012
Mona.

46:56.014 --> 46:58.047
Yes, sir, I know.

47:00.984 --> 47:02.852
I was wrong before.

47:04.955 --> 47:06.322
You...

47:07.591 --> 47:09.425
You're a very brave girl.

47:12.062 --> 47:13.596
Thanks.

47:18.837 --> 47:21.971
So, with the patron

47:23.407 --> 47:26.576
did you have to go
more and more undercover?

47:26.578 --> 47:27.610
Hm.

47:30.914 --> 47:32.448
Yes, sir,
we'll make it happen.

47:36.954 --> 47:39.188
Director says
we're going tomorrow.

47:40.123 --> 47:41.858
What?

47:41.860 --> 47:43.459
It's too soon.

47:43.461 --> 47:46.462
He already had her
for a sleepover. It's time.

47:59.576 --> 48:01.377
You're going to be fine.

48:08.186 --> 48:10.319
This stays in today, ry.

48:10.321 --> 48:12.321
I don't want you going dark
on me for even a second.

48:12.323 --> 48:14.223
-Clear?
-Clear.

48:14.225 --> 48:16.392
Good, 'cause it's my last one.

48:20.330 --> 48:24.033
I love you. And everything's
going to work out.

48:24.035 --> 48:25.668
I promise.

48:27.938 --> 48:29.405
Now,
let's go through this again.

48:30.941 --> 48:33.576
Step one, get the ruizs
out of the building.

48:33.578 --> 48:37.046
I've got more information
on bill.

48:37.048 --> 48:40.016
Can you meet me
at the hacienda?

48:40.018 --> 48:41.984
We can be there
in 20 minutes.

48:46.190 --> 48:48.658
Pascal will have eyes on
Fernando throughout the op.

48:48.660 --> 48:51.193
If he moves,
we'll know about it.

48:54.132 --> 48:56.465
Riley will gain entrance
through his office.

48:56.467 --> 48:59.635
I will run the show from our
mobile unit across the street.

49:02.372 --> 49:04.273
His personal computer
is the only portal

49:04.275 --> 49:05.608
set up for major transfers.

49:05.610 --> 49:07.176
So this is our window
to move the money

49:07.178 --> 49:09.378
into the CIA's offshore account.

49:09.380 --> 49:11.314
Then, we process the evidence

49:11.316 --> 49:13.115
and first thing tomorrow,
the cnp is kicking down

49:13.117 --> 49:14.951
ruiz's front door.

49:14.953 --> 49:16.686
With pleasure.

49:18.989 --> 49:20.456
Then, we go home.

49:22.259 --> 49:24.493
-Buenos dias.
-Buenos dias, Ms. Evans.

49:24.495 --> 49:27.997
Senor ruiz asked me to upload
some new security.

49:27.999 --> 49:30.232
Okay, let me just call him.

49:51.488 --> 49:53.622
-Please, go right ahead.
-Gracias.

50:27.024 --> 50:30.393
Fernando's still at home.
How is the transfer going?

50:30.395 --> 50:32.661
Already moved about
60 million

50:32.663 --> 50:34.797
from more accounts
than I thought.

50:36.033 --> 50:37.433
Keep at it. Plenty of time.

50:48.545 --> 50:52.548
Bill, there's more here.

50:52.550 --> 50:55.351
I've got evidence connecting
Fernando to medellin bank

50:55.353 --> 50:56.786
he and carlito burned down.

51:00.090 --> 51:01.724
We are here
for the gambling money.

51:01.726 --> 51:03.559
That's all the CIA cares about.

51:20.110 --> 51:24.246
I'm talking about murder,
bill. Human lives.

51:24.248 --> 51:27.850
Damn it, Riley.
For once, stick to the plan.

51:29.186 --> 51:31.120
I can get both.

51:33.723 --> 51:37.726
Your pardon is for helpin' us
seize the money, that is it.

51:37.728 --> 51:39.428
Riley.

51:44.267 --> 51:46.669
Bill, carlito's leaving.

52:06.156 --> 52:08.324
Stay calm,
we have a bit of a problem.

52:08.326 --> 52:09.758
Car's on the move.

52:09.760 --> 52:12.128
Where? Moving where?

52:13.597 --> 52:15.397
He's going to the bank.

52:15.399 --> 52:17.833
If she need more time, we need
to do something right now.

52:24.474 --> 52:25.875
Looks like he's headed back
to the bank.

52:25.877 --> 52:29.612
Maybe, seven minutes out.

52:29.614 --> 52:31.413
Take control of the onboard
computer. Shut it down.

52:36.453 --> 52:40.156
Okay, hermano, let's see
how you drive with no engine.

52:50.534 --> 52:53.369
He stopped.

52:53.371 --> 52:54.703
Stabbed him cold, babe.

53:03.547 --> 53:05.915
Scratch that.
Pascal, do you have him?

53:05.917 --> 53:09.451
Bill.
Bill, he's stealing other car.

53:16.593 --> 53:18.460
What's happening?

53:18.462 --> 53:19.895
Carlito's on his way
to the bank.

53:21.498 --> 53:23.799
-Just carlito?
-Yeah, and he's on to us.

53:23.801 --> 53:26.569
Make the transfer
and get gone.

53:27.637 --> 53:30.239
-Riley?
-Almost there.

53:30.241 --> 53:31.774
Just get the money and go.

53:37.814 --> 53:39.815
He's in the building.
Get out, get out now.

53:48.692 --> 53:50.226
Done.

54:10.247 --> 54:11.847
I'm headed down the stairs.

54:16.620 --> 54:18.387
Bill, I'm on the way down.

54:18.389 --> 54:20.356
I can buy you some time,
but you need to get the hell

54:20.358 --> 54:21.423
out of there.

54:37.841 --> 54:39.041
Move!

54:47.450 --> 54:50.052
Bill, I made it outside.
Where are you?

54:51.021 --> 54:53.422
Bill? Bill?

54:54.658 --> 54:56.525
I trusted you, Riley.

54:57.694 --> 54:59.928
I know about medellin.

55:02.465 --> 55:05.834
Bill? Bill, where are you?

55:07.704 --> 55:09.905
Bill, can you see me?
I'm outside. Where are you?

55:09.907 --> 55:12.741
Where is she? Where is she?
Where is she?

55:12.743 --> 55:13.842
Where is she?

55:19.449 --> 55:22.418
I got it, bill.

55:22.420 --> 55:25.554
All the money. I got it.

55:25.556 --> 55:26.989
Whoo!

56:59.849 --> 57:02.518
Carlito? Carlito?

57:07.157 --> 57:08.557
Whoo!

57:28.778 --> 57:30.112
You did great.

57:32.682 --> 57:34.082
We all did.

57:35.518 --> 57:37.085
Riley, you really deserve this.

57:39.456 --> 57:40.889
Time to go home.

57:48.565 --> 57:49.932
Oh!

58:21.030 --> 58:22.898
You traitor!

58:22.900 --> 58:25.767
You actually thought you could
be forgiven for what you did?

58:27.804 --> 58:31.273
The CIA's never even heard
a Fernando ruiz

58:31.275 --> 58:33.809
and they certainly don't
give a shit about you!

58:35.278 --> 58:37.779
You feel bad?

58:37.781 --> 58:40.148
For all those people
on that bus?

58:45.723 --> 58:47.189
I loved you.

58:49.792 --> 58:51.527
What about me?

58:52.529 --> 58:53.862
What about our kids?

58:54.964 --> 58:57.633
You ran away.

58:57.635 --> 59:03.038
I've lived with your mistake
every single day.

59:08.612 --> 59:12.648
Do you know what it's like
to be fucking the enemy?

01:01:09.766 --> 01:01:13.201
My name is Riley Connors.

01:01:13.203 --> 01:01:15.303
My name is Riley Connors.

01:01:25.314 --> 01:01:26.915
It was...

01:01:28.818 --> 01:01:30.452
It was more than
we talk about.

01:01:32.722 --> 01:01:34.790
I told you it was about money.

01:01:34.792 --> 01:01:36.892
Not about messing
after your girlfriend.

01:01:46.002 --> 01:01:48.036
Just stay here.

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:49.404
I handle this.

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:04.012
He's a cop, man. He's a cop.

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:06.481
You'll handle it? Huh?

01:03:13.122 --> 01:03:14.289
Riley!

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:38.079
What are you fucking doing?
We have to go!

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:42.484
Come on.

01:03:45.154 --> 01:03:47.489
-Come on.
-No, I can't.

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:48.990
-Uhh...
-Sit.

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:53.995
Riley, look at me. Look at me.

01:03:53.997 --> 01:03:55.230
Uh-huh.

01:03:56.232 --> 01:03:57.265
You okay?

01:04:03.906 --> 01:04:04.973
Shit!

01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:07.509
Let me get you home. Come on.

01:04:57.393 --> 01:04:59.594
Hey. Easy.

01:05:01.197 --> 01:05:02.564
You'll break the stitches.

01:05:11.674 --> 01:05:14.209
When did you transfer
to med school?

01:05:16.145 --> 01:05:18.446
None of your peace rally
ends peacefully.

01:05:20.016 --> 01:05:23.385
Did estelle make you follow me?

01:05:23.387 --> 01:05:25.320
Estelle didn't make me
do anything.

01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:28.323
I wanted to.

01:05:29.992 --> 01:05:32.193
Even if that meant
taking on the CIA.

01:05:34.096 --> 01:05:35.664
I don't think it was them.

01:05:36.299 --> 01:05:38.033
Ahh...

01:05:39.635 --> 01:05:43.672
I think it was just bill,
on his own, after the money.

01:05:48.444 --> 01:05:49.577
Hey, easy.

01:05:51.347 --> 01:05:52.547
Shit.

01:05:53.649 --> 01:05:55.417
You need a new bandage.

01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:28.216
Yeah. Uh...

01:06:28.218 --> 01:06:29.684
That's my thesis.

01:06:32.621 --> 01:06:35.223
"The tortured hero?"

01:06:38.127 --> 01:06:40.228
Yeah, you're alright.

01:06:41.597 --> 01:06:43.264
Mmm.

01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:51.373
Hey.

01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:53.375
You don't get to choose
when to tell the truth.

01:06:57.146 --> 01:06:58.613
You are a hero.

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:03.651
Heroes don't exist.

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:06.721
Just martyrs. Ohh...

01:07:07.423 --> 01:07:08.556
Aah!

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:12.460
Hey. Let me change it.

01:07:12.462 --> 01:07:14.295
Aa-ah! Ahh!

01:07:14.297 --> 01:07:15.497
Breathe in, breathe out.

01:07:15.499 --> 01:07:16.531
Breathe.

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:17.632
Ooh.

01:07:20.669 --> 01:07:22.137
Hold on, hold on.

01:07:23.506 --> 01:07:25.407
Come on, drama queen.

01:07:29.713 --> 01:07:32.514
Easy. Breathe.

01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:37.485
Estelle ever tell you
we're not columbian?

01:07:39.688 --> 01:07:41.489
No.

01:07:41.491 --> 01:07:43.425
My family was from Argentina.

01:07:45.327 --> 01:07:47.328
Like you.

01:07:47.330 --> 01:07:50.598
My parents were called traitors
for standing up to the huelga.

01:07:53.702 --> 01:07:57.505
Ann then the police came,
took 'em away

01:07:57.507 --> 01:08:03.711
and... we never saw our father
or mother again.

01:08:03.713 --> 01:08:05.380
I don't even remember them.

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:10.552
They were called
desaparecidos.

01:08:11.821 --> 01:08:14.322
Disappeared ones.

01:08:14.324 --> 01:08:17.559
Loaded on to aircrafts
and flown over the Atlantic.

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:22.764
Death flights, they called them.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:24.732
I'm still alive.

01:08:24.734 --> 01:08:26.868
They were thrown
out of the plane.

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:35.243
I'm sorry.

01:08:38.747 --> 01:08:40.448
Sorry won't bring them back.

01:08:41.817 --> 01:08:44.385
So...

01:08:44.386 --> 01:08:45.720
What do we do now?

01:08:51.727 --> 01:08:53.294
Give me your computer.

01:08:56.799 --> 01:09:00.234
Senor, I'm afraid
we have a slight problem here.

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:03.203
What problem?

01:09:03.206 --> 01:09:04.538
I'm sorry, but your balance

01:09:04.541 --> 01:09:06.307
is way below
your withdrawal amount.

01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:07.876
That's impossible.

01:09:07.877 --> 01:09:10.411
There are millions of dollars
in that account.

01:09:10.412 --> 01:09:11.578
I'm sorry.

01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:15.783
That's not it.

01:09:15.785 --> 01:09:17.752
Ay-ay-ay, sir. Excuse me, sir.

01:09:18.687 --> 01:09:20.220
What's happening?

01:09:23.325 --> 01:09:26.294
-What's happening?
-It's empty.

01:09:26.296 --> 01:09:27.729
That bitch.

01:09:39.875 --> 01:09:42.844
What's your favorite charity,
bill?

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:46.381
Remember the consequences when
you try to do something good.

01:09:46.383 --> 01:09:50.451
I will never forget
what happened to those people

01:09:50.453 --> 01:09:53.921
and I will never forget
how badly I misjudged you.

01:09:53.924 --> 01:09:55.823
How could you sink to this?

01:09:55.825 --> 01:09:59.494
After what you did,
what choice did I have, huh?

01:09:59.496 --> 01:10:01.896
The CIA was never
going to trust me again.

01:10:01.898 --> 01:10:04.399
I was an embarrassment.

01:10:04.401 --> 01:10:07.468
The analyst sleeping with our
country's biggest traitor.

01:10:09.271 --> 01:10:11.506
I was going to be somebody.

01:10:11.508 --> 01:10:13.541
Instead I met you.

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:17.512
You're Riley Connors,
and you ruined my life.

01:10:17.514 --> 01:10:19.714
You'll be back
in the spotlight soon.

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:21.482
Enjoy being me.

01:10:23.452 --> 01:10:26.321
Bill? Bill, look.

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.407
We need to go.

01:11:38.661 --> 01:11:40.628
Thank god you got away.

01:11:45.934 --> 01:11:49.437
Hey, hey, estelle,
it was my fault.

01:11:51.473 --> 01:11:53.007
I should have listened to you.

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:57.578
I'm ready now.

01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:59.580
What do you want to do?

01:11:59.582 --> 01:12:01.549
I have contacts at the DOJ.

01:12:01.551 --> 01:12:04.052
Rogue agent, theft, murder.

01:12:04.054 --> 01:12:07.555
This could be in the front page
of every newspaper in America.

01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:10.658
If we keep it
out of the headlines

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:12.460
they'll be begging
to cut you a deal.

01:12:16.432 --> 01:12:18.032
We can still get you back home.

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:23.471
I just want to put bill away.

01:12:24.907 --> 01:12:27.442
I don't care after that.

01:12:27.444 --> 01:12:28.476
I do.

01:12:29.978 --> 01:12:31.813
Where did you hide
all that money anyway?

01:12:33.549 --> 01:12:37.051
The bank account
that you opened for me.

01:12:37.053 --> 01:12:39.854
I doubt that we have more than
a day before it gets flagged.

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:43.057
I was not going to put it
into that CIA slush fund.

01:12:44.026 --> 01:12:45.727
You listen to yourself.

01:12:47.564 --> 01:12:49.097
I'll get that.

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.835
Jaime was right.

01:12:53.837 --> 01:12:54.869
Medellin?

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:57.004
Mm...

01:12:59.975 --> 01:13:03.111
That proves
they were behind the fire.

01:13:03.113 --> 01:13:07.081
Records, photographs...

01:13:07.083 --> 01:13:08.783
They're murderers.

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:13.888
I'll make sure these
gets into the right hands.

01:14:10.779 --> 01:14:13.047
Don't move, bill.

01:14:13.049 --> 01:14:14.515
Don't move, bill.

01:14:14.517 --> 01:14:16.050
Sister?

01:14:16.052 --> 01:14:17.084
Sister...

01:14:20.589 --> 01:14:23.090
No. Sister? Sister?

01:14:29.965 --> 01:14:31.799
Fuck!

01:14:31.801 --> 01:14:34.602
We have to go! I'm so sorry!

01:14:34.604 --> 01:14:36.237
We have to go! Please, let's go!

01:14:38.207 --> 01:14:40.842
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
we have to go.

01:16:31.687 --> 01:16:33.688
I don't know what to say.

01:16:45.634 --> 01:16:48.736
This bus runs
all the way to Cali.

01:16:48.738 --> 01:16:51.238
From there, you can slip in
to Ecuador and disappear.

01:16:58.313 --> 01:16:59.847
Riley, I'm not stupid.

01:17:03.051 --> 01:17:05.219
Estelle knew the dangers
and so do I.

01:17:07.923 --> 01:17:09.790
I am the danger.

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:12.927
Don't you see that?

01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:18.099
Everything I touch
turns to shit.

01:17:21.703 --> 01:17:23.204
So, you'll just run away again?

01:17:26.708 --> 01:17:28.643
I didn't say I was running.

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:34.348
Get on the bus.

01:17:55.737 --> 01:17:59.006
-Go ahead, Mona, go ahead.
-Okay, okay, okay.

01:17:59.008 --> 01:18:00.708
-Put the gun away, Pascal.
-You know me.

01:18:00.710 --> 01:18:02.443
You know me, Mona. You know...

01:18:34.443 --> 01:18:37.311
Pascal, where the fuck are you?

01:19:01.169 --> 01:19:03.104
Did you enjoy watching him?

01:19:04.773 --> 01:19:06.907
He did a good job with my face,
didn't he?

01:19:09.444 --> 01:19:12.113
You shouldn't have run.

01:19:12.115 --> 01:19:14.115
No one was supposed
to get hurt here.

01:19:16.184 --> 01:19:18.519
You killed a cop.

01:19:18.521 --> 01:19:21.222
No. I didn't pull the trigger.

01:19:23.158 --> 01:19:24.825
I didn't pull the trigger.

01:19:31.299 --> 01:19:33.167
I didn't pull the trigger.

01:19:36.805 --> 01:19:40.808
Tell me where the money is,
okay?

01:19:42.844 --> 01:19:44.345
And I'll make sure
you both live.

01:19:49.217 --> 01:19:52.953
I'm talking to you.

01:19:52.955 --> 01:19:55.956
Give me the account. Okay?

01:19:58.794 --> 01:20:00.961
Bill is not in charge.

01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:03.264
Now I in charge, okay?

01:20:03.266 --> 01:20:04.832
What are you going to do?

01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:07.935
Stop bill from killing us?

01:20:09.437 --> 01:20:11.338
Pascal, Pascal, Pascal!

01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:12.506
No, no, no, no!

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:19.980
Fuck! Fuck!

01:20:23.351 --> 01:20:25.286
Hey!

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:52.046
Hey!

01:22:07.155 --> 01:22:08.656
Aren't you going to ask me?

01:22:13.295 --> 01:22:16.497
Carlito...

01:22:16.499 --> 01:22:18.699
I thought you want to know
where the money is.

01:22:18.701 --> 01:22:20.434
I will find out.

01:22:36.251 --> 01:22:38.419
If you want to get the guy
that screwed you

01:22:38.421 --> 01:22:41.255
then you should answer that.

01:22:41.257 --> 01:22:47.494
Look, carlito, bill screwed with
both of us. Including him.

01:22:49.265 --> 01:22:51.131
I-i can bring him to you.

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:00.741
Pascal,
where the hell have you been?

01:23:00.743 --> 01:23:03.177
Lonely, isn't it?

01:23:03.179 --> 01:23:05.446
No friends, nowhere to run.

01:23:05.448 --> 01:23:08.215
Are you scared
of your own shadow yet?

01:23:08.217 --> 01:23:09.683
Where's Pascal?

01:23:11.353 --> 01:23:13.687
You should choose
your partners more carefully.

01:23:16.191 --> 01:23:18.993
We both know
you can't pull the trigger.

01:23:18.995 --> 01:23:22.496
I didn't have to.
He couldn't wait to flip on you.

01:23:22.498 --> 01:23:24.131
Only question now
is what charity

01:23:24.133 --> 01:23:25.466
I should give the rest to?

01:23:28.737 --> 01:23:30.471
You still think

01:23:30.473 --> 01:23:33.774
there's forgiveness
for people like you?

01:23:33.776 --> 01:23:37.211
You could give away
a billion dollars

01:23:37.213 --> 01:23:40.481
and you will still
be Riley Connors.

01:23:40.483 --> 01:23:44.084
The bitch who killed a bus
full of innocent people.

01:23:47.355 --> 01:23:48.689
I know.

01:24:03.171 --> 01:24:05.272
Sure did all you could do.

01:25:24.486 --> 01:25:26.220
This is what
it must've been like...

01:25:31.593 --> 01:25:33.327
With my parents.

01:27:48.263 --> 01:27:50.264
That way. That way.

01:27:56.004 --> 01:27:57.671
Please.

01:27:57.673 --> 01:27:59.640
Hey. Hey, hey!

01:27:59.642 --> 01:28:01.575
Easy, carlito.

01:28:03.611 --> 01:28:04.978
-Okay!
-Hey!

01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:07.948
-I kill you now.
-Easy, carlito.

01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:10.384
I kill you.

01:28:13.621 --> 01:28:14.888
Please...

01:28:17.725 --> 01:28:18.825
Please, look at me.

01:28:31.639 --> 01:28:34.941
Look at me.
Please don't do this.

01:28:34.943 --> 01:28:36.643
I have all the money, please.

01:28:44.519 --> 01:28:46.053
Please, Fernando,
look at me, look at me.

01:28:46.055 --> 01:28:48.655
Don't look at him. Look at me.
Look at me.

01:28:50.458 --> 01:28:51.892
No.

01:28:54.095 --> 01:28:55.729
I'm sorry.

01:28:59.834 --> 01:29:02.703
No, no, no. No, no, no. No.
Jaime. Jaime.

01:29:02.705 --> 01:29:04.838
-No, no, no. No. No, no.
-I'll kill you.

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:08.008
Please, stop. Stop, stop, stop!
Please, please!

01:29:12.847 --> 01:29:14.348
No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no.

01:29:14.350 --> 01:29:15.882
Wait, it was me
who stole the money.

01:29:17.518 --> 01:29:20.754
What do you want?

01:29:22.057 --> 01:29:24.057
I have all the money.

01:29:24.059 --> 01:29:27.427
Account 1-4-9 5-4-5 6-4-9.

01:29:27.429 --> 01:29:29.529
Every penny is in a local
checking account.

01:29:29.531 --> 01:29:31.131
It's all yours.

01:29:36.104 --> 01:29:37.871
Fernando.

01:29:39.474 --> 01:29:41.975
No, no, no, Fernando.
Fernando, look...

01:29:43.978 --> 01:29:45.445
Fernando...

01:29:47.982 --> 01:29:49.850
Please, don't do this!

01:29:52.553 --> 01:29:55.555
Fernando, look at me.
This isn't you.

01:29:55.557 --> 01:29:57.090
I'm sorry, Riley.
I have to do this.

01:29:57.092 --> 01:29:59.059
No, Fernando!
Please, don't!

01:30:01.796 --> 01:30:03.130
Fernando, look at me.

01:30:03.132 --> 01:30:05.532
This isn't you.
Don't listen to him.

01:30:05.534 --> 01:30:06.666
Ah!

01:30:09.170 --> 01:30:10.404
No!

01:30:19.447 --> 01:30:21.882
Hey, hey. Hey, hey,
just look at me. Look at me.

01:30:40.902 --> 01:30:42.436
CIA.

01:30:48.543 --> 01:30:50.544
Look at what he did!

01:30:58.019 --> 01:31:01.087
Fernando, Fernando,
help me get him up.

01:31:01.089 --> 01:31:02.823
Look at me.

01:31:23.711 --> 01:31:25.011
Lito!

01:31:31.819 --> 01:31:36.122
Fernando! Fernando!
Look at me. Look at me.

01:31:36.124 --> 01:31:39.559
He's dead. That was bill.
Please, please, please.

01:31:39.561 --> 01:31:40.961
Look at me. Look at me.

01:31:40.963 --> 01:31:42.496
He's dead and we need to go.

01:31:42.498 --> 01:31:43.997
Otherwise bill will
kill us both.

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:48.535
We need to get out of here,
and you need to help us, please.

01:31:49.871 --> 01:31:51.538
Please, I need help.

01:31:55.243 --> 01:31:59.145
Please. Look at me.

01:31:59.147 --> 01:32:01.147
I'm sorry.

01:32:01.149 --> 01:32:03.550
I'm sorry,
but you have to help us now.

01:32:03.552 --> 01:32:05.952
-Lito!
-He's dead. Please, I'm sorry.

01:32:05.954 --> 01:32:08.688
I'm so sorry
i made a mistake.

01:32:08.690 --> 01:32:10.690
-Okay. Okay.
-Okay.

01:32:21.135 --> 01:32:26.973
Riley, before you get someone
else killed, give me the money.

01:32:26.975 --> 01:32:28.708
Hey, hey.

01:32:30.545 --> 01:32:33.146
She doesn't have the money. Huh.

01:32:35.182 --> 01:32:37.250
She already
transferred it back to me.

01:32:39.754 --> 01:32:43.023
And I'll rather let it burn. Mm?

01:32:46.028 --> 01:32:48.094
You want to die?

01:33:48.190 --> 01:33:52.158
Hey! Hey!

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:53.760
Hey, hey, hey...

01:33:56.697 --> 01:33:57.831
Are you okay?

01:34:49.083 --> 01:34:50.884
What now?

01:34:55.222 --> 01:34:56.990
We go home.

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:00.760
Where?

01:35:03.964 --> 01:35:05.465
Wherever we want.
