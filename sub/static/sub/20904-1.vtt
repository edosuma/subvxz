<b>This is your chance to</b>

04:33.473 --> 04:35.843
<b>- I was thinking some kind of</b>
<b>robot, then his hand up here.</b>

04:35.909 --> 04:37.744
<b> <i>- For this first challenge,</i> </b>
<b> <i>what we're looking for</i> </b>

04:37.811 --> 04:40.080
<b>is someone to be creative</b>
<b>and work together</b>

04:40.080 --> 04:41.281
<b>and do the best they can</b>
<b>at something</b>

04:41.348 --> 04:42.282
<b>they've never done before.</b>

04:42.349 --> 04:43.984
<b>- So what was your idea?</b>

04:44.084 --> 04:46.153
<b>- I'm thinking about</b>
<b>doing a koi fish.</b>

04:46.220 --> 04:48.689
<b> <i>- If these people have a problem</i> </b>

04:48.755 --> 04:49.923
<b> <i>right off the bat,</i> </b>

04:49.990 --> 04:51.225
<b>they shouldn't have come here</b>
<b>together.</b>

04:51.291 --> 04:53.227
<b>- One of my ideas was to</b>
<b>incorporate the logo</b>

04:53.293 --> 04:54.528
<b>in there somewhere.</b>

04:54.595 --> 04:57.497
<b>- I don't want to force</b>

04:57.564 --> 05:00.033
<b>- I should mimic what you're</b>
<b>doing on the other side, right?</b>

05:00.033 --> 05:01.702
<b>- Uh, yeah, I mean,</b>
<b>that'd be cool, if you want.</b>

05:01.768 --> 05:05.272
<b>We're thinking the best thing</b>

05:05.339 --> 05:06.907
<b> <i>the bigger pieces first.</i> </b>

05:07.040 --> 05:08.876

<b>- [laughs]</b>
<b>That's not a good thing to say.</b>

05:18.819 --> 05:20.921

<b>damn fin.</b>

05:21.054 --> 05:22.789
<b>And you said</b>
<b>it's going like that.</b>

05:22.856 --> 05:24.057

<b>these fins now before we go</b>
<b>any lower.</b>

05:35.769 --> 05:37.604
<b>We don't even have the fin</b>

05:37.671 --> 05:38.605
<b>We don't have none</b>

05:38.672 --> 05:39.907
<b>- We're not there yet.</b>

05:39.973 --> 05:42.075
<b>- We're not on the same page,</b>
<b>obviously.</b>

05:42.075 --> 05:44.978
<b>If we're gonna carve out a inch,</b>
<b>we need to plan to have this</b>

<b>We got this.</b>

06:06.133 --> 06:08.669

<b>in the tattoo industry,</b>
<b>which is totally male dominated.</b>

06:11.305 --> 06:13.307

<b>- I figured out</b>
<b>that I can make some roses</b>

07:31.952 --> 07:33.187
<b> <i>on the inside</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the ice.</i> </b>

07:33.253 --> 07:35.055
<b>I should do one more</b>
<b>over here, right, or...</b>

07:35.122 --> 07:36.456
<b>- I don't think we should</b>
<b>worry about filling it</b>

07:36.523 --> 07:38.592
<b>'cause we don't want it</b>
<b>to be super cluttered.</b>

07:38.659 --> 07:41.728
<b>I specialize in a lot of</b>
<b>illustrative tattooing</b>

07:41.795 --> 07:45.065
<b> <i>with a very strong</i> </b>
<b> <i>traditional background.</i> </b>

07:45.098 --> 07:48.635
<b>With our powers combined, we</b>
<b>could be an unstoppable force.</b>

07:48.702 --> 07:51.638
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

07:51.705 --> 07:53.607
<b> <i>â™ª â™ª</i> </b>

07:53.674 --> 07:55.576
<b>- Five, four,</b>

07:55.642 --> 07:59.313
<b>three, two, one.</b>

07:59.379 --> 08:00.747
<b>That is it.</b>
<b>Time is up.</b>

08:00.814 --> 08:03.116
<b>No more sculpting.</b>

08:03.183 --> 08:04.218
<b>- We're wrapped.</b>

08:04.284 --> 08:06.186
<b>- First ice sculpture.</b>
<b>- Bam!</b>

08:06.253 --> 08:07.888
<b>- Hit it.</b>

08:08.021 --> 08:09.089
<b>[laughs]</b>

08:09.156 --> 08:12.092
<b> <i>[suspenseful music]</i> </b>

08:12.159 --> 08:13.327
<b>- All right,</b>
<b>Pinz and Needlez,</b>

08:13.393 --> 08:15.329
<b>it is now time to critique</b>
<b>your work.</b>

08:15.395 --> 08:16.563
<b>Talk to me about</b>
<b>your design.</b>

08:16.630 --> 08:18.131
<b>- Love goes into all</b>
<b>of our work that we do.</b>

08:18.198 --> 08:19.600
<b> <i>- We're all about heart.</i> </b>

08:19.666 --> 08:21.468
<b>- I like how recognizable it is</b>
<b>right off the bat.</b>

08:21.535 --> 08:23.537
<b> <i>There's some very small,</i> </b>
<b> <i>little veins</i> </b>

08:23.604 --> 08:25.272
<b> <i>and some ventricles up top</i> </b>
<b> <i>that are nice.</i> </b>

08:25.339 --> 08:27.140
<b> <i>But the big veins down through</i> </b>
<b> <i>the center are very smooth,</i> </b>

08:27.207 --> 08:28.542
<b>very well done.</b>

08:28.609 --> 08:30.344
<b>- This is the way to really</b>
<b>come out swinging</b>

08:30.410 --> 08:32.880
<b>and start off on the right foot.</b>

08:32.946 --> 08:34.448
<b>- Unkindness Art.</b>

08:34.515 --> 08:36.783
<b>- You created one large image</b>
<b>that's incredibly readable</b>

08:36.850 --> 08:38.418
<b> <i>with various textures.</i> </b>

08:38.485 --> 08:39.753
<b> <i>You guys put everything you had</i> </b>

08:39.820 --> 08:41.255
<b>into creating a piece of art</b>
<b>that's risky.</b>

08:41.321 --> 08:43.190
<b>To see what you're able to do</b>
<b>with a tattoo machine</b>

08:43.256 --> 08:44.191
<b>is gonna be exciting.</b>

08:44.258 --> 08:45.192
<b>I look forward to seeing it.</b>

08:45.259 --> 08:46.426
<b>both: Thank you.</b>

08:46.493 --> 08:47.461
<b>- Thicker Than Blood.</b>

08:47.528 --> 08:48.962
<b> <i>- This is a strong image.</i> </b>

08:49.062 --> 08:50.063
<b> <i>And it's powerful.</i> </b>

08:50.097 --> 08:51.265
<b>And that's what we are</b>
<b>as a shop.</b>

08:51.331 --> 08:52.666
<b>- Looks like it's a Hannya mask.</b>

08:52.733 --> 08:54.067
<b> <i>The anatomy's a little bit off.</i> </b>

08:54.134 --> 08:56.336
<b> <i>There's no forehead.</i> </b>
<b> <i>And it's all chin.</i> </b>

08:57.337 --> 08:58.939
<b>- Artistic Skin Design.</b>

08:59.072 --> 09:01.275
<b> <i>- You guys really put a lot</i> </b>
<b> <i>of time into the beveling.</i> </b>

09:01.341 --> 09:03.377
<b> <i>And especially you took a lot</i> </b>
<b> <i>of time, more detail,</i> </b>

09:03.443 --> 09:06.613
<b> <i>in the mouth to get that deep,</i> </b>
<b> <i>setback mouth with the teeth.</i> </b>

09:06.680 --> 09:09.049
<b>Valiant effort for a new medium.</b>

09:09.116 --> 09:11.051
<b>- Next up is Black Anchor.</b>

09:11.118 --> 09:14.288
<b> <i>- Everybody went pretty 3-D,</i> </b>
<b> <i>and y'all went totally flat.</i> </b>

09:14.354 --> 09:16.557
<b> <i>- Being the first challenge</i> </b>
<b> <i>out of the gate,</i> </b>

09:16.623 --> 09:17.624
<b> <i>take the brakes off.</i> </b>

09:17.691 --> 09:19.793
<b>Gotta go, man.</b>
<b>Go, go, go.</b>

09:19.860 --> 09:21.161
<b> <i>- Everybody knows who Carlos is.</i> </b>

09:21.228 --> 09:23.030
<b> <i>He's very popular</i> </b>
<b> <i>on the internet.</i> </b>

09:23.063 --> 09:25.766
<b>I was expecting to be wowed</b>
<b>by their ice sculpture</b>

09:25.832 --> 09:27.801
<b>and it was literally</b>
<b>a little flat.</b>

09:27.868 --> 09:29.803
<b>- Next up is The Marked Society.</b>

09:29.870 --> 09:31.605
<b>- What better than</b>
<b>a tattoo machine?</b>

09:31.672 --> 09:33.507
<b> <i>- It's super clean and legible.</i> </b>

09:33.574 --> 09:37.311
<b> <i>But what's super impressive</i> </b>
<b> <i>is how straight and precise</i> </b>

09:37.377 --> 09:39.479
<b>you were able to make each line</b>
<b>in this piece.</b>

09:39.546 --> 09:40.480
<b>- Thank you.</b>

09:40.547 --> 09:41.782
<b>- Allegory Arts.</b>

09:41.849 --> 09:43.417
<b> <i>How does this identify</i> </b>
<b> <i>your shop?</i> </b>

09:43.483 --> 09:45.052
<b> <i>- It's clearly the logo,</i> </b>
<b> <i>correct?</i> </b>

09:45.052 --> 09:46.687
<b>- It is.</b>
<b>It's also the state...</b>

09:46.753 --> 09:48.889
<b>- Of Alabama,</b>
<b>which is where our shop is.</b>

09:48.956 --> 09:51.391
<b>- The creativity of using</b>
<b>the shape of the state</b>

09:51.458 --> 09:53.060
<b> <i>as the whole block,</i> </b>
<b> <i>having the tip</i> </b>

09:53.093 --> 09:54.962
<b> <i>and the top of the flowers</i> </b>
<b> <i>poking out through it,</i> </b>

09:55.062 --> 09:56.797
<b> <i>the way you put the flower</i> </b>
<b> <i>in the background</i> </b>

09:56.864 --> 09:58.632
<b> <i>by impressing it in</i> </b>
<b> <i>so you can see it from the front</i> </b>

09:58.699 --> 09:59.800
<b> <i>is very nice.</i> </b>

09:59.867 --> 10:00.801
<b>The craftsmanship</b>
<b>is very well done.</b>

10:00.868 --> 10:01.802
<b>- Wow.</b>
<b>Thank you very much.</b>

10:01.869 --> 10:02.970
<b>- Thank you.</b>

10:03.036 --> 10:04.972
<b>- Classic Trilogy Tattoo.</b>

10:05.038 --> 10:07.174
<b> <i>- We're pretty much, like,</i> </b>
<b> <i>a big nerd shop.</i> </b>

10:07.241 --> 10:09.910
<b>So, like, everything we do</b>
<b>is just pop culture and fun.</b>

10:09.977 --> 10:11.645
<b>- It's a big, cool, fun image.</b>

10:11.712 --> 10:14.848
<b> <i>You really got the shape</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the ice to become what it is,</i> </b>

10:14.915 --> 10:16.416
<b> <i>and that really stands out.</i> </b>

10:16.483 --> 10:18.619
<b>And it's bold and strong.</b>

10:18.685 --> 10:20.020
<b>- Tri-Cities Tattoo.</b>

10:20.087 --> 10:21.655
<b>- I can definitely tell</b>
<b>it's a fish,</b>

10:21.722 --> 10:24.191
<b> <i>but it is a little bit hard</i> </b>
<b> <i>to see exactly what's going on.</i> </b>

10:24.258 --> 10:26.527
<b> <i>Seems like there's a lot of ice</i> </b>
<b> <i>that you just took away</i> </b>

10:26.593 --> 10:28.395
<b>and then a lot of ice</b>
<b>that you didn't use.</b>

10:28.462 --> 10:29.963
<b>- Gotcha.</b>

10:30.030 --> 10:31.698
<b> <i>- Tri-Cities' looked like</i> </b>
<b> <i>a damn beached whale.</i> </b>

10:31.765 --> 10:33.233
<b>I don't know what the hell</b>
<b>they were going for.</b>

10:33.300 --> 10:34.902
<b> <i>â™ª â™ª</i> </b>

10:34.968 --> 10:36.603
<b>- Today's first flash challenge.</b>

10:36.670 --> 10:38.505
<b>The stakes are a lot higher</b>
<b>than ever before</b>

10:38.572 --> 10:40.574
<b>because we've never given out</b>
<b>200 grand,</b>

10:40.641 --> 10:42.276
<b>we've never had shops</b>
<b>battling out.</b>

10:42.342 --> 10:44.678
<b>- There's a lot on the line</b>
<b>for the reputation of the shop.</b>

10:44.745 --> 10:46.647
<b>But I also think this is</b>
<b>a great advantage.</b>

10:46.713 --> 10:48.182
<b>- If they're smart</b>
<b>and they come in with someone</b>

10:48.248 --> 10:49.616
<b>who has what they don't have,</b>

10:49.683 --> 10:50.951
<b>those are the teams</b>
<b>that are really gonna shine.</b>

10:51.018 --> 10:53.020
<b>- I was pretty impressed</b>
<b>with Allegory Arts.</b>

10:53.086 --> 10:55.422
<b> <i>- You know, they really used</i> </b>
<b> <i>a lot of different techniques.</i> </b>

10:55.489 --> 10:57.291
<b> <i>- They did a couple little</i> </b>
<b> <i>trick effects</i> </b>

10:57.357 --> 10:58.759
<b>that just really set them apart.</b>

10:58.825 --> 11:00.794
<b>- I also think that</b>
<b>Pinz and Needlez did a great job</b>

11:00.861 --> 11:02.262
<b> <i>with the anatomical heart.</i> </b>

11:02.329 --> 11:05.332
<b>- Their piece was probably</b>
<b>the most legible piece.</b>

11:05.399 --> 11:07.935
<b>- One shop that did a really</b>
<b>great job in terms of using</b>

11:08.068 --> 11:10.370
<b>the entire block of ice</b>
<b>was Unkindness Art.</b>

11:10.437 --> 11:12.606
<b> <i>- That is a sculpture,</i> </b>
<b> <i>a bird from every angle</i> </b>

11:12.673 --> 11:13.607
<b>you look at it.</b>

11:13.674 --> 11:14.608
<b>- We're all pretty agreed, yeah?</b>

11:14.675 --> 11:15.609
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- Got it.</b>

11:15.676 --> 11:16.610
<b>- Let's let them know.</b>

11:16.677 --> 11:18.545
<b> <i>â™ª â™ª</i> </b>

11:18.612 --> 11:20.480
<b>Today at Skyland Stadium,</b>

11:20.547 --> 11:23.483
<b>some shops made a strong</b>
<b>first impression.</b>

11:23.550 --> 11:25.819
<b>The judges have decided</b>
<b>the winner</b>

11:25.886 --> 11:27.754
<b>of the first flash challenge...</b>

11:27.821 --> 11:30.190
<b> <i>[tense music]</i> </b>

11:31.825 --> 11:32.960
<b> <i>[rock music]</i> </b>

11:33.093 --> 11:34.294
<b>- Rad.</b>
<b>- [soft laugh]</b>

11:34.361 --> 11:35.629
<b> <i>- Used a lot of</i> </b>
<b> <i>different techniques.</i> </b>

11:35.696 --> 11:38.799
<b>And it really spelled out</b>
<b>your logo to the T.</b>

11:38.866 --> 11:40.667
<b>- Congratulations Ulyss and Eva.</b>

11:40.734 --> 11:44.938
<b>This week your shop is safe</b>
<b>from elimination.</b>

11:45.005 --> 11:46.740
<b> <i>- [groans]</i> </b>
<b> <i>They're safe?</i> </b>

11:46.807 --> 11:48.108
<b> <i>That sucks.</i> </b>

11:48.141 --> 11:50.444
<b>Everything about their sculpture</b>
<b>was half-thought.</b>

11:50.511 --> 11:52.980
<b> <i>You can tell they did that cool</i> </b>
<b> <i>little trick there at the end.</i> </b>

11:53.113 --> 11:55.182
<b>But tricks don't get you</b>
<b>through this competition.</b>

11:55.249 --> 11:57.117
<b>- Throughout this competition,</b>
<b>you'll see that</b>

11:57.184 --> 12:00.120
<b>the flash challenges can</b>
<b>drastically effect the outcome</b>

12:00.187 --> 12:03.657
<b>of who goes home and who lives</b>
<b>to fight another day.</b>

12:03.724 --> 12:05.893
<b>And that's why we're putting you</b>
<b>to the test</b>

12:05.959 --> 12:09.930

<b>We're heading to your next</b>
<b>flash challenge right now.</b>

12:15.469 --> 12:17.337
<b> <i>- Oh, my God, another one?</i> </b>

12:17.404 --> 12:18.839
<b>I don't even feel my hands.</b>

12:18.906 --> 12:20.807
<b>- Damn.</b>
<b>I'm tired.</b>

12:20.874 --> 12:22.776
<b>I was ready to go home</b>
<b>and defrost.</b>

12:22.843 --> 12:23.944
<b>- Let's hit the road.</b>

12:24.077 --> 12:29.116
<b> <i>â™ª â™ª</i> </b>

12:29.183 --> 12:31.084
<b>- What is happening?</b>
<b>Are they trying to kill us?</b>

12:31.118 --> 12:32.386
<b>- Yeah, we're [bleep].</b>

12:32.452 --> 12:35.155
<b>- If you can't draw,</b>
<b>you don't stand a chance.</b>

12:35.222 --> 12:36.456
<b>- [gasps]</b>
<b>- Oh, [bleep].</b>

12:36.523 --> 12:38.192
<b>- If you can't get</b>
<b>the proportions right,</b>

12:38.258 --> 12:39.193
<b>it's a no-go.</b>

12:39.259 --> 12:40.194
<b>- We're doing what?</b>

12:40.260 --> 12:41.495
<b>- Why'd it have to be snakes?</b>

12:41.562 --> 12:42.596
<b> <i>â™ª â™ª</i> </b>

12:44.651 --> 12:47.587

12:47.654 --> 12:52.192
<b> <i>â™ª â™ª</i> </b>

12:52.259 --> 12:53.994
<b>- All right.</b>
<b>Allegory Arts,</b>

12:54.061 --> 12:56.296
<b>your shop won the first</b>
<b>flash challenge</b>

12:56.363 --> 12:58.098
<b>and is safe from elimination.</b>

12:58.165 --> 12:59.266
<b>- Awesome.</b>

12:59.333 --> 13:01.835
<b>- You will not compete</b>
<b>in this challenge.</b>

13:01.902 --> 13:03.136
<b>- All right.</b>

13:03.203 --> 13:05.072
<b>- Hopefully that lit a fire</b>
<b>for the rest of you,</b>

13:05.138 --> 13:08.775
<b>because the next flash challenge</b>
<b>starts right now.</b>

13:08.842 --> 13:10.944
<b> <i>- We're cold,</i> </b>
<b> <i>we're covered in ice.</i> </b>

13:11.011 --> 13:13.246
<b>But Unkindness Art,</b>
<b>we're gonna soldier on,</b>

13:13.313 --> 13:14.548
<b> <i>'cause that's what we do.</i> </b>

13:14.614 --> 13:17.250
<b>- You must make a sign</b>
<b>that says your shop's name</b>

13:17.317 --> 13:20.721
<b>in custom lettering</b>
<b>out of metal.</b>

13:20.787 --> 13:21.755
<b> <i>â™ª â™ª</i> </b>

13:21.822 --> 13:23.190
<b>- Goddamn it.</b>

13:23.256 --> 13:26.093
<b> <i>- Lettering can go wrong</i> </b>
<b> <i>real quick.</i> </b>

13:26.159 --> 13:30.030
<b>If everything is not consistent,</b>
<b>the lines are shaky,</b>

13:30.097 --> 13:32.065
<b> <i>if it doesn't have a nice</i> </b>
<b> <i>flow to it,</i> </b>

13:32.132 --> 13:33.667
<b>it's not gonna look right.</b>

13:33.734 --> 13:37.504
<b>- First, you'll create a mold</b>
<b>by carefully carving your design</b>

13:37.571 --> 13:38.972
<b> <i>into plaster.</i> </b>

13:39.039 --> 13:42.976
<b>Then you must pour hot liquid</b>
<b>metal into the mold</b>

13:43.043 --> 13:44.578
<b>to make the sign.</b>

13:44.644 --> 13:45.946
<b>- What is happening?</b>

13:46.013 --> 13:46.980
<b>Are they trying to kill us?</b>

13:47.047 --> 13:48.315
<b> <i>It's day one.</i> </b>

13:48.382 --> 13:49.950
<b>- We definitely want to see</b>
<b>your shop's name,</b>

13:50.017 --> 13:52.119
<b>but we definitely want to see</b>
<b>some design elements with it.</b>

13:52.185 --> 13:53.920
<b>- Come out really showing art.</b>

13:53.987 --> 13:55.355
<b>Be different.</b>
<b>Stand out.</b>

13:55.422 --> 13:57.290
<b>- We expect to see more</b>
<b>than what we're used to.</b>

13:57.357 --> 13:59.026
<b>Two heads should work</b>
<b>better than one.</b>

13:59.092 --> 14:00.460
<b>- Hell yeah.</b>

14:00.527 --> 14:03.430
<b>- Win and your shop will also</b>
<b>be safe from elimination.</b>

14:03.497 --> 14:04.965
<b>- [bleep] yeah.</b>

14:05.032 --> 14:06.633
<b>- We gotta win this.</b>

14:06.700 --> 14:10.570
<b>- You have three hours to create</b>
<b>a custom sign.</b>

14:10.637 --> 14:14.174
<b>And your time starts now.</b>

14:14.241 --> 14:16.143
<b> <i>[exciting music]</i> </b>

14:16.209 --> 14:17.511
<b>- [bleep] out the way.</b>

14:17.577 --> 14:19.279
<b>- Lettering is definitely</b>

14:55.182 --> 14:56.383

35:21.272 --> 35:23.875
<b>and it would still be safer</b>

35:23.942 --> 35:26.044

<b> <i>- This tattoo, for me,</i> </b>
<b> <i>has a lot of problems.</i> </b>

38:11.136 --> 38:13.304
<b>It does not look like</b>
<b>the life study,</b>

<b>which then tells me that</b>
<b>you're challenged in drawing.</b>

38:15.306 --> 38:18.710
<b>Also, the quality of tattooing</b>
<b>here is not top-notch.</b>

38:18.777 --> 38:21.079

<b>was perfect because it was not.</b>

38:21.146 --> 38:23.381

38:26.184 --> 38:27.685
<b>- Thank you.</b>

<b>- I mean, we got a lot to show</b>
<b>here and we can prove it.</b>

38:30.188 --> 38:32.057

<b>I don't see the snake</b>

<b>but we show a lot</b>

39:03.354 --> 39:04.756
<b>of potential in that tattoo.</b>

39:04.823 --> 39:06.458
<b>- As far as drawing,</b>
<b>these guys' snake</b>

39:07.692 --> 39:08.993
