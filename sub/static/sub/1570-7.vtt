I can't believe
we're eating here.

00:34.471 --> 00:36.072
This place is so demeaning.

00:36.106 --> 00:37.473
Well, when you
can afford to pay,

00:37.508 --> 00:38.708
you can pick the restaurant.

Sorry, I try not
to make eye contact

01:04.834 --> 01:06.269
with my customers.

01:06.303 --> 01:08.371
They never make
eye contact with me.

01:08.405 --> 01:10.340
They should be ashamed
of themselves!

01:10.374 --> 01:12.809
You are not just some objects.

Wow, it's been forever.

At home.

01:17.815 --> 01:19.515
Actually, I did move out
for a bit.

01:19.550 --> 01:21.017
To your boyfriend's van.

You know, me and Kristen

catch you later then.

Hayley, can I talk to you
in private for a minute?

04:50.427 --> 04:52.829
Hayley, what you're suggesting
could get us in deep trouble.

04:52.863 --> 04:55.097
You're selling fake I.D.'s
to teenagers.

a slap on the wrist.

07:35.325 --> 07:38.394
Smith, I was tearing it up at
the Rope and Pony last night,

07:38.428 --> 07:41.030
and I accidentally picked
up a 17-year-old girl

07:41.064 --> 07:43.332
all because of this!

07:43.367 --> 07:45.501
Were it not for the girl's
father bursting in

07:45.535 --> 07:48.437
at the last moment, I'd be
a sex offender right now.

07:48.472 --> 07:52.174
Wow, I've never seen a fake I.D.
as sophisticated as this.

07:52.209 --> 07:53.943
If these got
into the wrong hands,

07:53.977 --> 07:56.278
they could be a huge threat
to national security.

07:56.313 --> 07:58.047
That's what I was trying
to tell her father

07:58.081 --> 08:01.217
before he fell on all those
bullets coming out of my gun.

08:01.251 --> 08:03.986
Anyway, your new priority
is to find the man

08:04.021 --> 08:06.389
who's making these and
shut him down for good.

08:06.423 --> 08:07.623
You can count on me, sir.

08:07.658 --> 08:08.658
Do we have any leads?

08:08.692 --> 08:09.659
Only one.

08:09.693 --> 08:11.460
He goes by the name Guttenberg.

08:11.495 --> 08:13.129
Steve Guttenberg.

08:13.163 --> 08:16.766
But we have no record of a man
by that name ever existing.

our best take ever.

08:40.490 --> 08:41.991
The best I've ever seen.

08:42.025 --> 08:43.359
That's right.

08:43.393 --> 08:44.493
He should be as nervous

08:44.528 --> 08:45.928
as you two look right now.

08:45.962 --> 08:48.164
All I have to do
is bait the trap.

08:48.198 --> 08:49.865
And he may be a master forger,

08:49.900 --> 08:52.668
but I am a master bai... whoa!

08:52.702 --> 08:54.570
Whoa, that was close.

08:54.604 --> 08:57.873
Almost master-baited
myself there.

Well... yeah.

09:09.653 --> 09:11.453
And I can't do it without you.

09:11.488 --> 09:13.355
You're the genius
who makes it all happen.

09:13.390 --> 09:14.456
You really mean that?

09:14.491 --> 09:15.591
I do.

I think about it,

I only know that one song.

09:25.669 --> 09:26.936

18:33.339 --> 18:34.573
Dad, Steve's in trouble!

18:34.607 --> 18:36.341
Oh, no, it's Guttenberg,
isn't it?!

18:36.376 --> 18:37.476
He's got him again!

18:37.510 --> 18:40.112
Sure, why not?
Just get to the docks now!

18:44.083 --> 18:46.551
Dimitri, you old so-and-so!

18:46.586 --> 18:48.353
Nice tracksuit, buddy.

18:48.388 --> 18:51.089
This is Guttenberg.
Best forger in the business.

18:51.124 --> 18:54.493
Hi. So I-I have
your passports.

18:54.527 --> 18:56.495
Now what do you have for us?

18:56.529 --> 18:58.330
These.

18:58.364 --> 18:59.498
(guns clicking)

18:59.532 --> 19:00.799
Uh-oh.

19:00.833 --> 19:02.200
(chuckles)
The double cross.

19:02.235 --> 19:04.269
Classic.

19:04.304 --> 19:05.604
STAN (over bullhorn):
Attention, you in the warehouse!

19:05.638 --> 19:07.172
We have you surrounded!

19:08.908 --> 19:11.410
This is the CIA!

19:11.444 --> 19:13.145
Guttenberg,
we know you're in there!

19:13.179 --> 19:14.713
Come out with your hands up!

19:14.747 --> 19:16.815
You want Guttenberg alive?

19:16.849 --> 19:18.383
You let us go!

19:18.418 --> 19:20.585
Wait. Steve is Guttenberg?

19:20.620 --> 19:21.687
HAYLEY:
No!

19:21.721 --> 19:23.689
Steve's not Guttenberg!

19:23.723 --> 19:25.123
I am.

19:25.158 --> 19:26.191
You're Guttenberg?

19:26.225 --> 19:27.859
Yes, Dad.

19:27.894 --> 19:30.028
And this is all my fault.

19:30.063 --> 19:32.364
I used Steve to make
money, and-and...

19:32.398 --> 19:34.099
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

19:34.133 --> 19:36.768
Kevin Ramage!

19:40.740 --> 19:43.375
Steve, thank God you're okay.

19:43.409 --> 19:45.344
Well, Smith, you
solved the case.

19:45.378 --> 19:47.245
You found Guttenberg.
Good work.

19:47.280 --> 19:48.780
Take her away.

19:48.815 --> 19:52.985
But, sir, Guttenberg or not,
I can't arrest my own daughter.

19:53.019 --> 19:55.053
Can you do it?

19:56.723 --> 19:58.590
Smith, your lawyer's
here to see you.

19:58.624 --> 19:59.758
Lawyer?

19:59.792 --> 20:01.226
He says he's your lawyer.

20:01.260 --> 20:03.395
His official lawyer card
checks out.

20:05.498 --> 20:07.199
Hi, Steve.

20:07.233 --> 20:09.968
Hayley, why'd you take
the rap for me?

20:10.003 --> 20:12.237
I... I felt bad.

20:12.271 --> 20:15.340
Your life was in danger,
and it was all because of me.

20:15.375 --> 20:17.976
You had a skill,
and I-I took advantage of it.

20:18.011 --> 20:19.511
But we were partners,

20:19.545 --> 20:21.780
and then you told those girls
I was a loser.

20:21.814 --> 20:23.281
I know. I'm sorry.

20:23.316 --> 20:25.217
They-they put me on the spot,

20:25.251 --> 20:27.419
and I was, I was just trying
to look cool.

20:27.453 --> 20:30.922
I guess I deserve to be in here
for the next ten years.

20:30.957 --> 20:33.425
See you when I'm 29.

20:33.459 --> 20:35.260
Oh, you mean...

20:35.294 --> 20:36.962
yesterday?

20:38.698 --> 20:40.032
Guard!

20:40.066 --> 20:41.099
Thanks, little brother.

20:41.134 --> 20:42.367
Any time, sis.

20:42.402 --> 20:45.070
Now if you'll excuse me,
I've got work to do.

20:47.507 --> 20:49.241
Open up cellblock H!

20:49.275 --> 20:52.778
Surprise inspection, ladies!
Let's whip 'em out!

20:52.812 --> 20:54.946
What a loser.
