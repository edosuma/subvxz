00:08.706 --> 00:10.473
You know, democracy
is fantastic,

00:10.474 --> 00:12.708
but it is also fucking dull.

00:12.709 --> 00:13.976
It doesn't even look like
they're gonna break a tie.

00:13.977 --> 00:15.677
Selina does not even
have to be here.

00:15.678 --> 00:18.614
<i>Oh, my God.
Is she falling asleep?</i>

00:18.615 --> 00:21.016
No, she cannot fall asleep
on live TV.

00:21.017 --> 00:23.752
Not on C-SPAN.
The irony would be too huge.

00:23.753 --> 00:25.219
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

00:25.220 --> 00:27.488
Are you really waving?
She cannot see you through the TV.

00:27.489 --> 00:28.789
Most of us learn that
when we're four.

00:28.790 --> 00:30.523
We can call her.
The vibrations will wake her up.

00:30.524 --> 00:32.491
No, she's not gonna fall asleep.

00:32.491 --> 00:34.460
It's probably just us
who have noticed.

00:34.461 --> 00:36.829
No, clive, no.

00:36.830 --> 00:38.898
She is not falling asleep.

00:38.899 --> 00:41.067
<i>No, it is just
very warm down there.</i>

00:41.068 --> 00:43.102
- Whoa, head jerk. Just head jerked.
- Okay.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:55.182 --> 00:58.150
You sure you set this
meeting for 8:00 a.M. Today?

00:58.151 --> 01:01.020
Am I sure?

01:01.021 --> 01:03.356
Okay, I'm sorry.
Okay, of course you did.

01:03.357 --> 01:06.092
Of course. Please, stop
staring at me like that.

01:06.093 --> 01:09.529
- Undressing me with your eyes.
- I'm adding more clothes, Mike.

01:09.530 --> 01:11.764
Clean jobs almost ready
for liftoff, right?

01:11.765 --> 01:13.465
A little more
detail work, but yes.

01:13.466 --> 01:15.267
I do think that we can
start the countdown.

01:15.268 --> 01:17.068
Okay, well, get your
spacesuits on.

01:17.069 --> 01:19.304
Speaking of spacesuits,

01:19.305 --> 01:21.605
I met Buzz Aldrin
at a book signing.

01:21.606 --> 01:22.840
You know what really
freaks those guys out?

01:22.841 --> 01:26.543
Seeing 17 dawns in a
matter of 24 hours. Okay.

01:26.544 --> 01:28.745
- Good morning.
- Morning, ma'am.

01:28.746 --> 01:30.112
How is my day looking, sue?

01:30.113 --> 01:33.983
You have one community college
meeting this afternoon.

01:35.152 --> 01:37.119
- Is that it?
- Yes.

01:37.120 --> 01:38.721
No, no, no, no.
That's not right.

01:38.722 --> 01:41.657
Uh, okay, wait a minute.
What happens if you scroll down?

01:44.026 --> 01:49.631
- How about if you scroll up?
- That's the past, ma'am.

01:51.234 --> 01:54.002
- What's he for?
- Mike's your 8:00.

01:54.003 --> 01:57.639
We're talking about your speech for the
firefighter's association tonight.

01:57.640 --> 02:00.274
- Hey, where is Dan?
- I have been trying him all morning.

02:00.275 --> 02:02.943
- He's not been picking up.
- I don't like that.

02:02.944 --> 02:04.878
Probably sending photos
of his dick to himself.

02:04.879 --> 02:07.147
Left him a voicemail.
Called him a name.

02:07.148 --> 02:08.981
- Just a little thing we do.
- Mike!

02:08.982 --> 02:12.051
So here's what I'm thinking.
We need to open with a funny joke.

02:12.052 --> 02:13.952
Solid narrative throughout it,

02:13.953 --> 02:16.756
into which I would like to
pepper, like, five zingers.

02:16.757 --> 02:19.725
- No problemo. McClintock gold.
- Okay. Good.

02:19.726 --> 02:21.962
I thought for the opener we'd do
a little self-deprecating joke

02:21.963 --> 02:23.697
- about your snooze in the Senate.
- No.

02:23.698 --> 02:26.500
- Want to hear it?
- No.

02:26.501 --> 02:27.768
Okay.
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

02:27.769 --> 02:29.269
Okay, here you go,
first home run.

02:29.270 --> 02:32.172
Firefighters have a passion
for their work.

02:32.173 --> 02:34.375
Arsonists just have
a burning desire.

02:36.411 --> 02:37.711
Is that even a joke?

02:37.712 --> 02:39.580
Yeah, it's a word play
or a parody.

02:39.581 --> 02:41.816
- Mmm.
- Okay, doesn't matter.

02:41.817 --> 02:43.317
- Got another one.
- All right.

02:43.318 --> 02:45.887
<i>Ladders, obviously germane
to the firefighting business.</i>

02:45.888 --> 02:48.856
You go, "firefighters are
always climbing ladders

02:48.857 --> 02:50.825
and in politics
you're always..."

02:50.826 --> 02:53.361
and this, I don't even know what
I wrote, but it's basically

02:53.362 --> 02:55.764
you're taking steps to

02:55.765 --> 02:58.634
get somewhere
but without a ladder...

02:58.635 --> 03:00.968
Yeah, this is not
making me laugh at all.

03:00.969 --> 03:02.437
We'll bring that one
back when it's ready.

03:02.438 --> 03:04.672
Okay, "fire safety guy
asked me the other day,"

03:04.673 --> 03:06.909
and this is your voice...
"do I smoke in bed?

03:06.910 --> 03:09.845
And I said, 'I've never
had any complaints.'"

03:11.948 --> 03:13.515
<i>Too shock?
Too shock?</i>

03:13.516 --> 03:15.584
<i>Okay, this is kind
of a half an idea.</i>

03:15.585 --> 03:18.219
All right, so the idea
is if you're a fireman

03:18.220 --> 03:20.322
putting a wet blanket
on something...

03:20.323 --> 03:22.991
- You are late.
- Yes, and I am incredibly sorry.

03:22.992 --> 03:26.294
I was not in my own apartment last night.
I just... I overslept.

03:26.295 --> 03:29.631
Okay, having a massive stroke is an
excuse for coming in late to this office.

03:29.632 --> 03:31.099
Having sex
is absolutely not, Dan.

03:31.100 --> 03:32.901
Quite right, ma'am.
Although, in my defense,

03:32.902 --> 03:35.304
- I didn't even think you'd be here.
- Why?

03:35.305 --> 03:38.640
Well, there's the briefing on the fiscal
responsibility bill at the White House.

03:38.641 --> 03:40.075
I just assumed you'd be there.

03:40.076 --> 03:42.077
I wasn't invited.
What?

03:42.078 --> 03:44.245
- This is happening...
- Right now.

03:44.246 --> 03:45.614
Fuck that potus.

03:45.615 --> 03:48.317
He did this with the defense
budget briefing two weeks ago.

03:48.318 --> 03:50.719
God. Where is Amy?

03:50.720 --> 03:52.688
- You get a gag on top of...
- Mike!

03:52.689 --> 03:55.391
Why didn't I know about this?!

03:57.160 --> 04:00.463
I'm going.
They can't keep me out of there.

04:05.569 --> 04:08.638
Hey, ma'am, I'm right here.
Can I get you something?

04:08.639 --> 04:10.807
You got rollerblades?

04:14.078 --> 04:16.279
I'm coming in.

04:23.521 --> 04:25.656
Okay.

04:25.657 --> 04:27.191
Good.

04:31.463 --> 04:33.197
Hi, guys.

04:34.866 --> 04:37.534
- Fiscal responsibility.
- It's ridiculous.

04:37.535 --> 04:39.503
Are you kidding me?
Not one of those guys

04:39.504 --> 04:41.738
has paid for their own
lunch in like a decade.

04:41.739 --> 04:44.574
I think I made a big point
by being there.

04:44.575 --> 04:47.043
- Big point.
- I was breathing really heavily, though.

04:47.044 --> 04:49.278
You don't think anyone noticed that,
do you?

04:49.279 --> 04:50.980
Bob Lewis has got emphysema.

04:50.981 --> 04:52.815
Sounds like a broken-down
leaf blower.

04:52.816 --> 04:55.051
He does.

04:55.052 --> 04:57.520
That is an actually uncanny
impression of him.

04:57.521 --> 04:59.054
- Madam Vice President.
- Yeah?

04:59.055 --> 05:00.689
- Oh, hi, Jonah.
- Hey, Jonah.

05:00.690 --> 05:02.324
- You coming to see us?
- Oh, no.

05:02.325 --> 05:03.793
I had to take a personal hour.

05:03.794 --> 05:05.595
I have a nutritionist
appointment.

05:05.596 --> 05:08.531
- Oh, hope you're okay.
- It'll be fine.

05:08.532 --> 05:10.567
I'm fructose intolerant.

05:10.568 --> 05:12.469
- Fructose?
- Fruit sugars.

05:12.470 --> 05:14.538
- It's very rare.
- Oh.

05:14.539 --> 05:16.273
Well, good luck with all that.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.843
Thank you.

05:18.844 --> 05:21.746
Just when you thought
he couldn't get any weirder,

05:21.747 --> 05:24.083
- He did.
- My God.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.789
Oh, uh, sorry about earlier.

05:29.790 --> 05:31.357
I thought you
were in the chair.

05:31.358 --> 05:34.059
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna need a meeting with everybody.

05:34.060 --> 05:36.262
I need a coffee.

05:36.263 --> 05:38.064
Here's the deal.

05:38.065 --> 05:40.666
The President is avoiding me.

05:40.667 --> 05:42.334
Maybe he's just flakey
like Gary's feet.

05:42.335 --> 05:44.636
No, I know him.
He hates confrontation,

05:44.637 --> 05:47.172
and obviously there is something
that he needs to confront me about.

05:47.173 --> 05:51.242
I mean, am I still getting
unequivocal support on clean jobs?

05:51.243 --> 05:54.913
I need some good, solid
White House intel on this.

05:54.914 --> 05:56.148
- Yup, the whitegeist.
- Right.

05:56.149 --> 05:57.382
- I'm on it.
- Good.

05:57.383 --> 05:59.718
- Okay, please, please.
- Okay. Okay.

05:59.719 --> 06:02.556
I'm gonna check and see
if this fireman thing tonight

06:02.557 --> 06:03.790
is getting mentioned anywhere.

06:03.791 --> 06:05.992
- Whoa, are you self-googling?
- Yeah.

06:05.993 --> 06:07.961
We have guys in the office
to do that, ma'am.

06:07.962 --> 06:10.530
I wouldn't search on your name
or your nicknames, really.

06:10.531 --> 06:14.301
My nicknames?
Gary, what are my nicknames?

06:16.371 --> 06:19.406
There's just some nicknames
that it's necessary

06:19.407 --> 06:23.042
for us to search on to kind
of pick up on blog coverage.

06:23.043 --> 06:25.945
- But, I mean, like what?
- Uh, okay.

06:25.946 --> 06:29.782
There's one that has to do
with the legislation you did

06:29.783 --> 06:31.517
to support women
breast feeding in public.

06:31.518 --> 06:33.152
- That was good legislation.
- It was good legislation.

06:33.153 --> 06:35.254
- Mammary Meyer.
- Oh, please.

06:35.255 --> 06:37.956
- Like that.
- Are there others?

06:37.957 --> 06:41.059
Oh, really?
Okay.

06:41.060 --> 06:44.863
Grisly Madam, She-ra,
Meyer the Liar,

06:44.864 --> 06:46.765
the Batcave, Pissface.

06:46.766 --> 06:50.002
Wicked Witch of the
West Wing, Veep Throat,

06:50.003 --> 06:52.437
VoldeMeyer,
Dickless Van Dyke,

06:52.438 --> 06:55.674
Tawdry Hepburn, Blunder
Woman, Selina Meh.

06:55.675 --> 06:57.375
Pissface? Huh?

06:57.376 --> 06:59.543
No, not that one.

06:59.544 --> 07:02.145
Vaselina, Betty Poop.

07:02.146 --> 07:05.014
People attack you because they think
you're beautiful and you're smart.

07:05.015 --> 07:07.683
You got the most nicknames when you
where on the cover of "Vogue."

07:07.684 --> 07:10.453
I remember that. They were just jealous.
Remember that?

07:10.454 --> 07:13.455
- They called you Goofy Smile.
- Let's not get into it.

07:15.392 --> 07:17.760
Hmm, bummer.
Looks like your girlfriend

07:17.761 --> 07:19.995
didn't get the chief of staff
job with the speaker.

07:19.996 --> 07:21.764
Guess I don't have
to buy a hat now.

07:21.765 --> 07:23.933
Hat?
Oh, wedding?

07:23.934 --> 07:26.202
No.

07:26.203 --> 07:28.070
Put a lot of time in on Alice.

07:28.071 --> 07:29.872
I was deliberately late
for work because I wanted her

07:29.873 --> 07:31.741
to believe that she was more
important to me than my job.

07:31.742 --> 07:32.975
She fall for that?

07:32.976 --> 07:34.810
I doubt it.
But it's the thought that counts.

07:34.811 --> 07:37.146
She appreciates the gesture of me trying
to trick her into believing that.

07:37.147 --> 07:39.181
That is so romantic.

07:39.182 --> 07:42.585
Sadly, the beautiful thing
we had faded very suddenly

07:42.586 --> 07:46.022
- eight minutes ago.
- So who's next?

07:46.023 --> 07:48.457
Which strategically useful
young woman will get to witness

07:48.458 --> 07:50.759
your two-hour morning
skin care regime?

07:57.199 --> 07:59.199
You like this place?
I love this place.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.768
Yeah.
No frills.

08:01.769 --> 08:03.737
Not a single frill.

08:03.738 --> 08:05.739
When they bring out the bread,
you check it out.

08:05.740 --> 08:08.675
It is a fuckload of bread.
Believe me, you could feed a family,

08:08.676 --> 08:11.009
like a fat family off
the fuckload of bread alone.

08:11.010 --> 08:13.279
Think I'm gonna get an orange juice.
You want one?

08:13.280 --> 08:15.248
Oh, no. No way, dude.
Fructose.

08:17.418 --> 08:19.852
So clean jobs is
looking pretty exciting.

08:19.853 --> 08:21.254
What about the White House?
They as stoked as we are?

08:21.255 --> 08:22.589
Hey, man, yeah.
I'm out of the office.

08:22.590 --> 08:24.657
- I don't want to talk shop.
- Oh, right, right, yeah.

08:24.658 --> 08:27.360
Just punched out.
Just two guys hanging.

08:27.361 --> 08:29.696
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. I like hanging with you.

08:29.697 --> 08:31.198
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

08:31.199 --> 08:32.533
It's too bad Amy doesn't.

08:32.534 --> 08:34.267
Please, she's just
fucking jealous.

08:34.268 --> 08:37.071
I mean, come on, since you guys went
out you've been getting action, right?

08:37.072 --> 08:38.639
Oh, mad action.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.808
I got a cock like
a cappuccino frother.

08:40.808 --> 08:43.644
One of the big ones.
The industrial ones, not the little ones.

08:43.645 --> 08:45.513
Thanks, Joe.

08:45.514 --> 08:47.281
Fuck, yeah.

08:47.282 --> 08:51.185
What did I tell you? That's like two
grain silos fucked right there.

08:51.186 --> 08:54.455
Yup, that's a regular
granary gangbang.

08:54.456 --> 08:56.490
Oh, dude, did you hear
that fucking bullshit

08:56.491 --> 08:59.093
that Max Geldray is saying
that potus is avoiding Selina?

08:59.094 --> 09:01.296
Max Geldray knows shit
about shit.

09:01.297 --> 09:03.631
The only intel he has
is on his fucking PC.

09:03.632 --> 09:06.834
Intel, that's a brand
of microprocessor.

09:06.835 --> 09:10.172
- Strong joke.
- Potus, he knows clean jobs has traction.

09:10.173 --> 09:12.741
Senator Macauley,
he'd sponsor that bill in a heartbeat.

09:12.742 --> 09:15.811
He's got a big veiny
boner for it.

09:17.313 --> 09:19.748
Oh, shit. They need me back
at the west wing like now.

09:19.749 --> 09:21.683
- What, did we declare war?
- No, it's worse.

09:21.684 --> 09:23.784
Interactive tourist section
of the website is down.

09:23.785 --> 09:27.455
Hey, there's this extreme metal band
playing over at Labyrinth's tonight.

09:27.456 --> 09:30.792
Just real fucked up noise.
They don't even have a name.

09:30.793 --> 09:32.427
- You want to check it out?
- Yeah, man.

09:32.428 --> 09:35.330
Let's go catch some decibels.
You cut me, I bleed metal.

09:35.331 --> 09:37.967
- Great.
- And what would you like?

09:37.968 --> 09:40.503
To eat at a different
fucking restaurant.

09:45.543 --> 09:48.078
So Mike's jokes didn't work?

09:48.079 --> 09:51.615
Yeah. I mean, firefighters
are used to seeing people die, Amy,

09:51.616 --> 09:53.283
but not like that.

09:53.284 --> 09:56.553
Listen, we have got to
congratulate Martin on this.

09:56.554 --> 09:59.856
I mean, this is such a great
draft of the clean jobs bill.

09:59.857 --> 10:01.758
Yeah, it's pretty much all here.
We just need to...

10:01.759 --> 10:04.860
Up the stakes substantially?
Noncompliance penalties,

10:04.861 --> 10:06.662
don't you think those
should be greater?

10:06.663 --> 10:07.897
I think we should
just go for it.

10:07.898 --> 10:09.598
I think we should
just fine the fuckers

10:09.599 --> 10:12.634
till the fuckers aren't fine.

10:15.772 --> 10:17.806
That was totally inappropriate.

10:17.807 --> 10:19.909
- Inappropriate.
- Inappropriate.

10:19.910 --> 10:22.244
That's not the first time that
that's happened, by the way.

10:22.245 --> 10:24.781
He's not supposed
to register emotion.

10:24.782 --> 10:26.783
He's supposed to be
like a robot geisha.

10:26.784 --> 10:28.484
- I'll see to it.
- Yeah.

10:28.485 --> 10:31.687
So we still don't know
if this bill

10:31.688 --> 10:33.356
has unequivocal
support from potus.

10:33.357 --> 10:35.825
Well, Dan is working
intel on that.

10:42.599 --> 10:44.366
<i>- Hey.
- Hey, Gary.</i>

10:44.367 --> 10:46.435
I'm gonna head home.

10:46.436 --> 10:48.637
- If it's okay. If I'm not needed.
- Yeah, sure.

10:48.638 --> 10:49.904
What's in the bag?

10:49.905 --> 10:51.739
Oh, I got my first
zumba class tonight.

10:51.740 --> 10:53.508
- Oh. Neat.
- I'm excited.

10:53.509 --> 10:56.110
Amy and I are gonna be
working pretty late, I think.

10:56.111 --> 10:58.280
Would you do me a favor?
Could you go and pick up

10:58.281 --> 11:01.217
some of those takeout
crab cakes from Levin's?

11:01.218 --> 11:03.619
<i>- I love those.
- Yeah.</i>

11:03.620 --> 11:06.256
- That wouldn't spoil your plans, would it?
- No, ma'am.

11:06.257 --> 11:09.860
Hey, Gary, what are some
of the other nicknames?

11:09.861 --> 11:12.263
Oh, come on.
This is masochism.

11:12.264 --> 11:14.198
No, it's not.
I have very thick skin.

11:14.199 --> 11:15.766
I'm just interested,
that's all.

11:15.767 --> 11:17.501
It's just various
V.P. things.

11:17.502 --> 11:19.970
You know, like using
the initials V.P. jokingly.

11:19.971 --> 11:22.840
- Like what?
- Vaguely Personable.

11:22.841 --> 11:25.042
Viagra Prohibitor.
Visible Panties.

11:25.043 --> 11:27.511
Viagra Prohibitor?

11:27.512 --> 11:31.482
Why, because when a guy's with
me he doesn't need viagra?

11:31.483 --> 11:33.783
No.

11:33.784 --> 11:36.919
It means that even
if a guy uses it...

11:39.023 --> 11:41.724
It doesn't work?

11:41.725 --> 11:44.661
They are saying that
a prescription medication

11:44.662 --> 11:48.431
that is supposed to guarantee
a strong and sustained erection

11:48.432 --> 11:51.501
in all men despite their age
or their health

11:51.502 --> 11:54.237
is rendered ineffective by me?

11:54.238 --> 11:56.874
You know what?
You no longer search on the nicknames.

11:56.875 --> 11:58.543
<i>- You said you had thick skin.
- God, no.</i>

11:58.544 --> 12:00.712
- Wait, what about V-Pilf?
- No, Gary.

12:00.713 --> 12:02.514
That's flattering.
You know what that means?

12:02.515 --> 12:05.518
Vice President I Would Like to,
you know, fool around with.

12:05.519 --> 12:06.652
- Fuck.
- Okay.

12:09.656 --> 12:13.026
Ah! This is
fucking primordial.

12:13.027 --> 12:16.062
You know what? You can't find
these guys on fucking iTunes.

12:16.063 --> 12:18.398
- You know why?
- 'Cause they don't have a name?

12:18.399 --> 12:20.367
'Cause they're not
for fucking sale.

12:20.368 --> 12:22.002
Fucking listen to this.

12:22.003 --> 12:25.672
This is fucking like being
operated on by a chimp

12:25.673 --> 12:28.942
with a hard-on and a hacksaw.
Radical stuff.

12:28.943 --> 12:33.747
Yeah. That's exactly how I feel
about the clean jobs legislation.

12:33.748 --> 12:36.649
Has potus said anything about
how high the agenda's gonna go?

12:36.650 --> 12:39.452
All noises are good.
I'm in a meeting tomorrow

12:39.453 --> 12:42.656
and it's definitely gonna get discussed.
I'll call you.

12:42.657 --> 12:44.824
That would be awesome, man.
Thank you. That's great.

12:44.825 --> 12:47.694
Pick up this round, I'll get the next one.
And grab some nuts.

12:47.695 --> 12:49.996
I'm sweating all my minerals
into my shorts here.

12:49.997 --> 12:52.532
Get some fucking nuts!

12:55.836 --> 12:59.772
You know, I've asked Dan and
Mike to play devil's advocate

12:59.773 --> 13:01.508
against this bill,
assemble some arguments.

13:01.509 --> 13:03.276
You know, what people might
say against it and stuff.

13:03.277 --> 13:05.111
Dan is a great choice.

13:05.112 --> 13:07.680
He is already a huge
advocate of the devil's.

13:07.681 --> 13:09.648
Potus needs some
successes right now.

13:09.649 --> 13:11.617
He doesn't fix
the economy soon,

13:11.618 --> 13:13.986
NASA's gonna have to
build him an escape pod.

13:13.987 --> 13:16.122
I mean, how has he
let this happen?

13:16.123 --> 13:18.457
- God, if I were...
- Mm-mmm.

13:18.458 --> 13:19.992
Don't say,
"if I were President."

13:19.993 --> 13:22.294
- It's the V.P. bear trap.
- Okay.

13:22.295 --> 13:24.963
I won't say it.
I'll just think it.

13:24.964 --> 13:27.266
Thanks for working
late tonight, Amy.

13:27.267 --> 13:29.367
Don't feel like you have
to come in early tomorrow.

13:29.368 --> 13:30.902
Okay, thanks.

13:30.903 --> 13:32.470
But you will come in
early, right?

13:32.471 --> 13:33.972
- Of course.
- Yeah.

13:33.973 --> 13:36.774
Shit, Sidney Purcell.
Should we go another way?

13:36.775 --> 13:38.542
No, I'm not scared
of oil lobbyists.

13:38.543 --> 13:40.877
- I'm only scared of two things.
- Yeah, bats and Alzheimer's.

13:40.878 --> 13:43.480
Yeah, well remembered.
Sidney Purcell.

13:43.481 --> 13:45.615
Madam Vice President.
So good to see you.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.329
Guess what we were just doing?

13:47.330 --> 13:49.051
Just polishing up
the latest draft of clean jobs.

13:49.052 --> 13:52.088
You know, I am from oil, but that
doesn't mean that I don't care deeply

13:52.089 --> 13:55.125
about my children's future and, of
course, their children's future.

13:55.126 --> 13:56.793
Speaking of children,
I've got to go.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.496
Catherine is waiting
to Skype with me.

13:58.497 --> 14:00.831
Great seeing you, as always,
madam Vice President.

14:00.832 --> 14:02.567
- Okay, take care.
- Bye-bye.

14:02.568 --> 14:05.237
I don't have any children.

14:05.238 --> 14:07.005
I have a niece
but I fucking hate her.

14:07.006 --> 14:08.941
How charming.
I need to be getting home.

14:08.942 --> 14:12.345
I wanted to tell you if you think this
bill of yours is gonna go the distance,

14:12.346 --> 14:15.114
than you must be even
stupider than I think you are.

14:15.115 --> 14:18.650
And I should tell you, I think you're
borderline developmentally disabled.

14:18.651 --> 14:21.453
This bill is a fucking disgrace

14:21.454 --> 14:23.421
and I'm gonna see
to it personally

14:23.422 --> 14:26.457
that it gets chewed up like a dead
prostitute in a wood chipper.

14:26.458 --> 14:28.859
Just wanted to let you know.

14:30.662 --> 14:33.864
You sure you're ready,
Mr. Thrash Metal?

14:33.865 --> 14:36.867
Heard you only got two
hours of sleep last night.

14:36.868 --> 14:39.570
Yeah, well, with how many times
you've got to get up and pee, Mike,

14:39.571 --> 14:41.739
I think we're about even.

14:41.740 --> 14:44.643
Hey, have you boys read
the latest draft of clean jobs?

14:44.644 --> 14:46.075
Yes, ma'am.

14:46.076 --> 14:48.581
Okay, so you've got your critiques
all prepared?

14:48.582 --> 14:50.850
- Mm-hmm.
- Who's gonna go first?

14:50.851 --> 14:53.320
Ladies first.

14:53.321 --> 14:55.522
So you can be harsh.
You don't need to hold back or anything.

14:55.523 --> 14:58.091
Sure.

14:58.092 --> 15:00.160
This is class genocide.

15:01.529 --> 15:04.998
This is...
this... um, huh?

15:04.999 --> 15:07.535
This is rich white people
and their rich white champion

15:07.536 --> 15:09.870
Selina Meyer demanding
an unproven solution

15:09.871 --> 15:12.639
to an unproven problem so they
can sleep better at night.

15:12.640 --> 15:16.344
Who works for large
polluting companies?

15:16.345 --> 15:18.913
Ordinary blue collar Americans.

15:18.914 --> 15:22.016
Who will get fired or have their
wages cut to pay for these taxes?

15:22.017 --> 15:23.485
Ordinary moms and dads.

15:23.486 --> 15:26.621
Who will suffer when these companies
are no longer competitive

15:26.622 --> 15:29.558
because of your high taxes
and noncompliance penalties.

15:29.559 --> 15:32.828
This is cold, calculated,
class genocide

15:32.829 --> 15:34.930
perpetrated by someone
who is either evil

15:34.931 --> 15:37.399
or eligible to be
held on a 5150

15:37.400 --> 15:39.301
at a mental health facility.

15:39.302 --> 15:41.403
Shame on you, Selina Meyer.

15:41.404 --> 15:42.771
- Okay.
- Remember that name.

15:42.772 --> 15:45.507
No one will want to call
their child by that name.

15:45.508 --> 15:48.443
There are no more Adolfs.
Soon there will be no more Selinas.

15:48.444 --> 15:51.112
You are looking
at the last Selina.

15:51.113 --> 15:53.947
The Selina who killed America.

15:56.551 --> 15:57.818
Wow.

15:57.819 --> 16:00.755
Oh, my God, Dan.

16:00.756 --> 16:03.657
- No more Selinas?
- Okay.

16:03.658 --> 16:06.627
Quiet, okay?
I don't need to hear you.

16:06.628 --> 16:09.029
<i>Mike?</i>

16:09.030 --> 16:10.564
Oh.

16:17.071 --> 16:20.172
My chief criticism is that
I don't fully understand it.

16:20.173 --> 16:22.808
<i>- If I don't understand it...
- All right, good job, dummy.</i>

16:22.809 --> 16:24.977
Sit down.

16:28.214 --> 16:30.448
- Where's Selina?
- She's on her way back from lunch.

16:30.449 --> 16:32.984
You know that trip to Paris?

16:32.985 --> 16:34.152
- Uh-huh.
- It's on.

16:34.153 --> 16:35.353
- No!
- Yeah.

16:35.354 --> 16:36.855
<i>Oh, Amy, I have a quick
q for you to a.</i>

16:36.856 --> 16:39.291
- Quickly, then.
- In diary hierarchy,

16:39.292 --> 16:41.026
does the national
resource committee meeting

16:41.027 --> 16:42.917
trump the care
for children's association?

16:42.918 --> 16:45.732
- Yes.
- Okay, I will kill the children.

16:45.733 --> 16:48.469
You know what would be perfect in
Paris is that pink jacket you have.

16:48.470 --> 16:51.105
Ma'am! Ma'am!
It's a fucking disaster.

16:51.106 --> 16:53.441
What is?
It could be a lot of things.

16:53.442 --> 16:56.910
The President is very eager to get the
fiscal responsibility bill through.

16:56.911 --> 17:00.514
- So eager that...
- Oh, shit, no.

17:00.515 --> 17:02.649
He wants all focus
to be on that bill.

17:02.650 --> 17:04.584
He's dropped five
other pieces of legislation.

17:04.585 --> 17:06.986
- No.
- Clean jobs is one of them.

17:06.987 --> 17:09.421
Oh, God.

17:13.726 --> 17:16.027
- My clean jobs?
- Yeah.

17:16.028 --> 17:17.963
Oh, son of a bitch.

17:17.964 --> 17:21.098
That president, he is a
suffocating son of a bitch.

17:21.099 --> 17:22.733
It's okay.

17:22.734 --> 17:25.971
Had we not heard
anything about this?

17:25.972 --> 17:29.608
Apparently there were
rumblings in the blogs.

17:29.609 --> 17:31.243
Why weren't we on it?

17:31.244 --> 17:33.645
They used a nickname, ma'am, and
we were not searching on it.

17:33.646 --> 17:35.947
- Which one?
- Mrs. DoubtMeyer.

17:35.948 --> 17:38.350
Well, you never
mentioned that one.

17:38.351 --> 17:40.586
Yeah, that means you're
kind of slightly confused.

17:40.587 --> 17:42.721
You're oddly masculine.

17:42.722 --> 17:45.524
It's a shitty nickname.

17:45.525 --> 17:48.494
Well, I'm just not
gonna accept this.

17:48.495 --> 17:51.197
Oh, my God.
I'd have more power in my hands

17:51.198 --> 17:54.333
if I joined one of those
moronic Segway tours of D.C.

17:54.334 --> 17:59.505
I mean, do you have any idea
what I have lost here today?

17:59.506 --> 18:02.408
Do you?
Really?

18:02.409 --> 18:05.644
Are you not gonna say anything?

18:05.645 --> 18:07.445
Jesus!

18:07.446 --> 18:09.948
Dan, did your boyfriend
know anything about this?

18:09.949 --> 18:11.983
I was trying to use
Jonah for intelligence.

18:11.984 --> 18:14.752
<i>That's like trying
to use a croissant</i>

18:14.753 --> 18:17.021
- as a fucking dildo.
- I thought...

18:17.022 --> 18:18.656
No, no, no.
Let me be more clear.

18:18.657 --> 18:24.029
It doesn't do the job
and it makes a fucking mess!

18:24.030 --> 18:25.597
Get out of my office.

18:28.835 --> 18:30.736
- Gary!
- Yes, ma'am? Yes, ma'am?

18:30.737 --> 18:33.005
- I need something.
- Okay, is there anything specific?

18:33.006 --> 18:34.873
I don't fucking know.
I just need something.

18:34.874 --> 18:36.742
I'll tell you what
I'm going to do.

18:36.743 --> 18:38.844
I'm gonna call that
stupid potus myself.

18:38.845 --> 18:40.889
Seriously, I'm gonna tell him
to shove it up his ass.

18:40.890 --> 18:42.014
I don't see any reason...

18:42.015 --> 18:43.448
Ma'am, why don't we
just wait this out, okay?

18:43.449 --> 18:44.649
"Why don't
we just wait this out?"

18:44.650 --> 18:46.617
Is that what
you're gonna suggest?

18:46.618 --> 18:49.153
Remind me never to get trapped inside
a burning building with you, Mike.

18:49.154 --> 18:51.321
- I'm very good in a fire.
- Ma'am, if I may.

18:51.322 --> 18:54.591
I think I have an idea.
What if we went to a friendly senator

18:54.592 --> 18:57.794
and suggested that he or she take
the best parts of clean jobs...

18:57.795 --> 19:00.797
the sanctions on polluters, tax
breaks for the good guys...

19:00.798 --> 19:02.666
then added that as an amendment

19:02.667 --> 19:05.202
to the fiscal
responsibility bill?

19:09.040 --> 19:11.809
Well, that would get the meat of
clean jobs through, wouldn't it?

19:11.810 --> 19:14.077
It would also mean we'd go
against the President's wishes.

19:14.078 --> 19:16.346
- That's provocative, ma'am.
- Yeah.

19:16.347 --> 19:18.515
Well, I feel like
provoking someone.

19:18.516 --> 19:20.250
I really do, Mike.

19:20.251 --> 19:23.953
I'm feeling very
fucking provocative.

19:23.954 --> 19:25.555
I'm aware of that, ma'am.

19:25.556 --> 19:29.058
The President won't like that.
I can tell you that right now.

19:29.059 --> 19:31.627
- This is the bear trap.
- I know, you're right.

19:31.628 --> 19:33.595
We can't do this.
Can we? We can't.

19:33.596 --> 19:36.699
We can do anything we want
if we really want to.

19:36.700 --> 19:39.035
What is this?
"Eat, Pray, fucking Love"?

19:39.036 --> 19:41.304
- Give me a minute.
- I can't be seen

19:41.305 --> 19:44.040
sneaking through legislation
behind the President's back.

19:44.041 --> 19:47.110
I mean, that would be insane.
It would be disloyal.

19:47.111 --> 19:50.080
Ma'am, senator Macauley loves this bill
and he may decide to do it anyway.

19:50.081 --> 19:53.184
Well, if senator Macauley
wants to do it himself,

19:53.185 --> 19:54.652
then that's great, you know?

19:54.653 --> 19:56.921
It's just that I can't
be seen doing it.

19:56.922 --> 19:59.089
Okay?
Okay?

19:59.090 --> 20:00.991
Ma'am, I got you
a little bit of ice cream.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.226
I thought that might be
just what you wanted.

20:02.227 --> 20:04.294
That is just exactly
what I wanted.

20:04.295 --> 20:07.630
- Would you get me some whipped cream?
- Yeah, give me a minute.

20:08.699 --> 20:10.700
I wanted to tell you,
but I couldn't

20:10.701 --> 20:12.335
because I didn't know
if you already knew,

20:12.336 --> 20:13.903
but my loyalty is with potus.

20:13.904 --> 20:16.272
Bullshit. You didn't know he was
gonna roll over on clean jobs.

20:16.273 --> 20:19.709
- You had no fucking idea.
- Dan, I had a fucking idea.

20:19.710 --> 20:22.479
You know what, Jonah? I don't think
that we should see each other anymore.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.515
- Come on.
- Sorry.

20:24.516 --> 20:27.619
So you're saying that just
because I'm not as close

20:27.620 --> 20:29.621
to potus as you thought I was,

20:29.622 --> 20:31.323
that means that we
can't hang out anymore?

20:31.324 --> 20:33.091
What I'm saying,
you fucking ape,

20:33.092 --> 20:37.329
is that you are a useless
waste of fucking carbon.

20:37.330 --> 20:39.565
I've been trying
to cynically use you,

20:39.566 --> 20:42.768
but you're so fucking low-rent,
you can't even be exploited.

20:42.769 --> 20:47.205
Not to mention the fact any restaurant
that serves anything in a fuckload

20:47.206 --> 20:48.707
is not a nice restaurant.

20:48.708 --> 20:50.241
Where is the bread
at this place, asshole?

20:50.242 --> 20:53.244
- And you, you upstate New York dickshit...
- Watch it.

20:53.245 --> 20:54.746
Yeah, I'll talk about
upstate New York.

20:54.747 --> 20:57.449
You guys think you're fucking
New York, but you're not.

20:57.450 --> 21:00.051
And you with your
perpetual 5:00 shadow,

21:00.052 --> 21:01.586
you're not that great
to be around.

21:01.587 --> 21:03.321
I don't like you, Dan.

21:03.322 --> 21:06.224
Really? I think you do.
I think you're a little sweet on me, Jonah.

21:06.225 --> 21:07.559
That's why you're so upset.

21:07.560 --> 21:09.527
You know what, Dan?

21:09.528 --> 21:12.664
You're a fucking dick.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.734
Well, careful when you
go to sleep tonight, asshole.

21:15.735 --> 21:17.736
Maybe I'll sneak into your
apartment with a bag of oranges

21:17.737 --> 21:19.070
and fructose you to death.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.976
Hey, we should send potus
a postcard from Paris.

21:23.977 --> 21:27.479
What's French for
"shove it up your ass"?

21:27.480 --> 21:31.584
God, Parisian women
really intimidate me.

21:31.585 --> 21:33.386
Why?

21:33.387 --> 21:37.157
I don't know.
They're so Parisian.

21:37.158 --> 21:39.125
You're as stylish
as any Parisian woman.

21:39.126 --> 21:41.061
Oh, thank you.

21:42.096 --> 21:44.731
- Oh, so are you.
- Thank you.

21:44.732 --> 21:47.233
That took too long, didn't it?

21:47.234 --> 21:49.102
- We can't go to Paris.
- Shit.

21:49.103 --> 21:51.304
No, whoa, whoa.
We got all those tours lined up.

21:51.305 --> 21:52.705
- What are you talk...
- Be quiet. What?

21:52.706 --> 21:54.707
They're anticipating another
tied vote in the Senate.

21:54.708 --> 21:56.276
You need to head back
to preside again.

21:56.277 --> 21:58.144
- It's gavel time.
- What bill is it?

21:58.145 --> 22:01.147
- That was a play on "it's hammer time."
- I know. What bill is it?

22:02.450 --> 22:06.620
No. No.
It's the Macauley amendment?

22:06.621 --> 22:08.956
Yeah. It's the meat
of clean jobs.

22:08.957 --> 22:11.626
- Oh.
- Which way are you gonna vote?

22:11.627 --> 22:15.663
The way that my principles
and conscience tell me to go.

22:15.664 --> 22:17.065
Okay.

22:17.066 --> 22:19.400
Which way do you
think that should be?

22:20.870 --> 22:23.638
Look, you already know
my feelings on this.

22:23.639 --> 22:25.774
The President does not want

22:25.775 --> 22:27.942
the clean jobs amendment
passed in any form.

22:29.512 --> 22:31.212
Dan, talk, please.

22:31.213 --> 22:33.782
If it comes down
to a tie, vote for.

22:33.783 --> 22:36.451
- You back your own policy.
- Yeah? You think so?

22:36.452 --> 22:37.586
- No.
- Yes.

22:37.587 --> 22:40.255
So you are actually saying

22:40.256 --> 22:42.524
that you want me
to destroy the policy

22:42.525 --> 22:44.426
that you and I have been
working on for months,

22:44.427 --> 22:46.229
actually years
if you think about it, Amy?

22:46.230 --> 22:47.997
- Yes.
- Wow.

22:47.998 --> 22:49.399
All right, let me
get this straight.

22:49.400 --> 22:53.136
So you, Dan, who are absolutely
against this policy,

22:53.137 --> 22:56.773
don't say otherwise,
you want me to vote for it.

22:56.774 --> 22:59.342
And you, Amy,
who love this policy,

22:59.343 --> 23:00.943
you want me to vote against it.

23:00.944 --> 23:03.713
Yeah?

23:03.714 --> 23:07.684
This is some weird ass "through the
looking glass" shit right now.

23:07.685 --> 23:09.385
- Vote against.
- Vote for.

23:11.054 --> 23:12.822
Hey, ma'am.
They need you on the floor.

23:12.823 --> 23:14.457
Oh, boy.
Ahem.

23:14.458 --> 23:16.359
All right, well...

23:18.662 --> 23:20.697
See you later, folks.

23:20.698 --> 23:22.866
Wish me luck.

23:25.203 --> 23:27.805
You got Macauley to add
this amendment, didn't you?

23:27.806 --> 23:29.807
- I know you did.
- Macauley is his own man.

23:29.808 --> 23:32.343
If you did this,

23:32.344 --> 23:35.079
you went against
Selina's explicit orders

23:35.080 --> 23:38.850
and you have put this entire office
into a salad spinner of fuck.

23:42.488 --> 23:46.056
What, are you checking your
fantasy fucking football scores?

23:46.057 --> 23:48.525
Get the fuck off it.

23:49.794 --> 23:53.964
Hey. Oh, man.
What's she gonna do?

23:53.965 --> 23:56.433
What I said.

23:56.434 --> 24:00.504
On this vote, the yeas are 50,
the nays are 50.

24:00.505 --> 24:02.806
The Senate
being equally divided,

24:02.807 --> 24:06.276
the Vice President votes
in the negative

24:06.277 --> 24:08.813
and the amendment
is not agreed to.

24:14.219 --> 24:17.288
Is this what I came into
politics to do, Amy?

24:17.289 --> 24:19.123
It's a rhetorical question.

24:19.124 --> 24:21.826
Obviously I didn't come
into politics to do this.

24:21.827 --> 24:23.961
On a happy note, we reassigned

24:23.962 --> 24:26.664
- the smiling secret service guy.
- Mmm.

24:26.665 --> 24:28.899
It's one less grinning idiot with
a gun you have to worry about.

24:28.900 --> 24:31.135
Oh, God, what?

24:31.136 --> 24:33.771
- Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.
- And yet you are disturbing me.

24:33.772 --> 24:35.706
Potus is anxious,
after recent events,

24:35.707 --> 24:39.609
that you don't feel he's trying to nudge
you out of process of government.

24:39.610 --> 24:42.779
Oh, isn't that thoughtful, Amy?

24:42.780 --> 24:44.881
So he would like you
to head up a program

24:44.882 --> 24:47.317
that is very important
and very dear to his heart.

24:47.318 --> 24:49.752
No, no, no, no, no.

24:49.753 --> 24:51.620
You do not do this to me.

24:51.621 --> 24:55.958
Do not say that it is obesity.
Do not say that to me.

24:55.959 --> 24:58.595
- It's obesity.
- No, no.

24:58.596 --> 25:00.363
I'm sorry, ma'am, but you
have drawn the fat straw.

25:00.364 --> 25:03.167
I will have all the relevant
documents forwarded onto your team.

25:03.168 --> 25:05.570
Okay, it's your bedtime.
Get out of my office.

25:05.571 --> 25:07.405
Good night.

25:07.406 --> 25:09.440
Oh, God.

25:09.441 --> 25:11.977
Amy.

25:11.978 --> 25:13.879
I mean, seriously.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.347
Are you believing
this fucking day?

25:15.348 --> 25:17.949
I had to pull the plug
on clean jobs,

25:17.950 --> 25:22.787
I'm about to go to France,
and now he gives me obesity.

25:22.788 --> 25:25.990
My God. I'll tell you
something else, too.

25:25.991 --> 25:28.459
This is deliberate, Amy.

25:28.460 --> 25:32.029
The President knows how
uncomfortable I am made...

25:32.030 --> 25:34.631
by fat people.

25:36.668 --> 25:39.870
You want to know the secret
to keeping weight off?

25:39.871 --> 25:41.739
Shut your fucking pie hole.

25:41.740 --> 25:43.941
How about that?
It's not rocket science.

25:43.942 --> 25:45.542
I'm not a nutritionist, am I?

25:45.543 --> 25:47.278
No, I'm not.
But I do know one thing.

25:47.279 --> 25:49.113
You've got to put
the corndog down,

25:49.114 --> 25:51.616
you've got to get up off your dead
one, you've got to get moving.

25:51.617 --> 25:54.786
"Get moving might" actually be a
good slogan for this damn thing.

25:54.787 --> 25:57.122
Oh, my God. It's weakness.
That's really all it is.

25:57.123 --> 25:58.823
Pure and simple, it's weakness.

25:58.824 --> 26:00.425
It's about self-control.

26:00.426 --> 26:02.727
You don't masturbate
in the subway, do you, Amy?

26:02.728 --> 26:05.262
No, you don't.
Do you shit in the street, Amy?

26:05.263 --> 26:06.597
No, of course you don't.

26:06.598 --> 26:08.999
Because you've gotten
ahold of yourself.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.834
And now I've got say what?
I've got to say,

26:10.835 --> 26:12.569
"I'm the Vice President
of the United States.

26:12.570 --> 26:15.105
Put the cupcake down."
That's now my job?

26:15.106 --> 26:16.873
I... it's...

26:16.874 --> 26:19.543
Oh, for fuck's sake.

26:19.544 --> 26:21.279
Have you ever had
a weight problem?

26:21.280 --> 26:23.781
Yeah, I have.
