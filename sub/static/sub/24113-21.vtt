15:31.580 --> 15:33.620
Well, with Aldertree
in the Gard,

15:33.620 --> 15:36.540
I suppose I'm the closest
thing to an expert in
Heavenly Fire there is.

15:36.540 --> 15:38.710
That's definitely
what that was?

15:38.710 --> 15:42.120
The sword that you made
to free Clary from Jonathan

15:42.120 --> 15:44.210
when the shrapnel hit you,

15:44.210 --> 15:46.080
it infused your cells
with Heavenly Fire.

15:47.250 --> 15:49.210
There must be a way
to remove it.

15:49.210 --> 15:52.040
Chelation therapy maybe? What
they use for silver poisoning?

15:53.040 --> 15:55.380
If only it were that simple.

15:55.380 --> 15:57.880
I was just on fire.
No need to be delicate.

15:59.330 --> 16:02.330
When I started working
with Aldertree,

16:02.330 --> 16:05.080
one of our lead scientists
was struck with the debris

16:05.080 --> 16:07.960
of an unstable canister
of highly concentrated

16:07.960 --> 16:09.250
Heavenly Fire
that exploded.

16:10.580 --> 16:13.670
His condition was exactly like
what's happening to you.

16:14.710 --> 16:16.790
The Heavenly Fire within him
flared up every time

16:16.790 --> 16:18.540
he came in contact
with anything demonic.

16:18.540 --> 16:20.120
What happened to him?

16:20.120 --> 16:21.460
Each time he came
in contact

16:21.460 --> 16:25.420
with a Downworlder, he became
increasingly unstable,

16:25.420 --> 16:29.380
until the fire within him
raged out of control and...

16:30.880 --> 16:32.920
...just like that sword
exploded...

16:34.500 --> 16:36.330
...he was blown into pieces.

16:37.880 --> 16:39.880
There was nothing
that we could do to save him.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.290
I'm a Shadowhunter.

16:45.710 --> 16:47.210
If I keep hunting demons...

16:49.620 --> 16:50.580
...I'll die?

16:52.250 --> 16:55.210
It's not just demons,
Isabelle.

16:55.210 --> 16:57.830
Coming in contact
with anything demonic -

16:57.830 --> 17:01.330
including those with demon
blood - could set you off.

17:01.330 --> 17:02.670
Potentially killing them, too.

17:06.210 --> 17:09.250
Look, I know that this is
a lot to process.

17:10.710 --> 17:13.170
If you want, I could explain it
to Alec and the others.

17:18.830 --> 17:21.790
No. I'll tell them myself.

17:24.290 --> 17:27.210
I didn't "set her on fire."
We were just kissing and then--

17:27.210 --> 17:28.750
You were kissing
my sister?!

17:28.750 --> 17:30.080
I mean, she was
kissing me, too.

17:30.080 --> 17:31.500
Easy, big brother.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.040
Izzy, I was so worried.

17:33.040 --> 17:34.380
Is everything alright?

17:34.380 --> 17:37.040
Just some temporary side
effects, but I'm gonna be fine.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.040
Thank the Angel.

17:40.040 --> 17:41.920
What? Am I not allowed
to say that?

17:41.920 --> 17:42.960
No, uh...

17:44.250 --> 17:47.080
Izzy. Hey, are you OK?

17:48.210 --> 17:49.460
We came as soon
as we heard.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.960
Great. Hugs
for everybody else.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.250
Simon, it...

17:56.210 --> 17:58.420
The Heavenly Fire
from when the sword exploded...

17:59.420 --> 18:01.080
...until it leaves
my system,

18:01.080 --> 18:03.540
I can't touch anyone
with demon blood.

18:03.540 --> 18:05.540
For how long?
Are we talking days?

18:05.540 --> 18:07.120
Weeks? Months?

18:07.120 --> 18:09.120
I don't know. I don't know.
But I'm gonna be fine.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.790
OK? It's manageable.

18:14.120 --> 18:15.830
What is going on here?

18:15.830 --> 18:18.290
Isabelle and Simon
were kissing

18:18.290 --> 18:20.000
when this happened.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.330
What?!

18:21.330 --> 18:22.500
Please tell me you have
a lead on Jonathan.

18:23.960 --> 18:28.380
Yeah. We, uh, tracked down
a mid-level demon known for

18:28.380 --> 18:30.250
associating with the Clave
on Wall Street.

18:30.250 --> 18:31.920
He didn't have
any information on Jonathan.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.500
But he did have
news on Lilith.

18:33.500 --> 18:35.120
What kind of news?

18:36.830 --> 18:40.170
She's gathering an army
to take down Magnus.

18:42.250 --> 18:43.380
She'll kill him.

18:43.380 --> 18:45.380
And if she does,
the rift will re-open.

18:45.380 --> 18:47.170
He sacrificed
everything to save us.

18:48.330 --> 18:51.120
If he's going up against Lilith,
I have to be there with him.

18:51.120 --> 18:54.460
Alec, you know that if
any of us went to Edom,
we'd die instantly.

18:54.460 --> 18:57.290
The atmosphere is demonic.
But maybe I can go.

18:57.290 --> 18:58.580
My Heavenly Fire
might protect me.

18:58.580 --> 18:59.750
No. No.

18:59.750 --> 19:02.040
Only someone with demon blood
can survive there.

19:04.170 --> 19:05.750
Simon...

19:05.750 --> 19:08.040
I don't have my Mark anymore,
but I'm sure if you give me

19:08.040 --> 19:09.420
enough swords,
maybe I can--
No.

19:11.080 --> 19:13.040
I need you to turn me
into a vampire,

19:13.040 --> 19:14.330
so I can go.

19:14.330 --> 19:16.250
What?! Alec, are you
out of your mind?

19:16.250 --> 19:17.170
What else am I supposed to do?

19:18.420 --> 19:19.420
Please. Just...

19:20.880 --> 19:22.210
...let me try this.

19:22.210 --> 19:23.420
Absolutely not.
Izzy's right.

19:23.420 --> 19:24.670
I'm a terrible sire.

19:24.670 --> 19:26.460
We'll find another way!
What other way?!

19:27.580 --> 19:29.040
Uh?

19:29.040 --> 19:30.790
Tell me! Tell me something!
Any of you?

19:37.790 --> 19:39.540
OK, we've got to figure
something out.

19:39.540 --> 19:41.210
Let's look in the Archives

19:41.210 --> 19:43.250
under anything that even
mentions the word Edom.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.380
(SIMON): OK.

19:45.210 --> 19:46.250
I'll meet you there.

as you may be,

20:19.830 --> 20:22.670
you'll be completely vulnerable
during your transformation.

20:22.670 --> 20:23.620
Leave me alone!

20:25.040 --> 20:26.580
Tell me,
what if a Shadowhunter happens

20:26.580 --> 20:29.420
upon you as you lay
cocooned and defenseless?

20:29.420 --> 20:30.290
(COUGHING)

20:31.500 --> 20:33.460
They'll murder me in my sleep.

20:34.540 --> 20:35.620
So let me help you, dear.

20:35.620 --> 20:37.460

before you feel better.

20:41.500 --> 20:42.710
(COUGHING)

20:45.250 --> 20:46.750
If you dare betray me...

20:46.750 --> 20:49.380
Now why would
I ever do that?

20:49.380 --> 20:51.540
(GASPING)

21:04.750 --> 21:05.710
(MELIORN): Isabelle.

21:06.790 --> 21:09.330
Meliorn. Thank you
for coming.

21:09.330 --> 21:11.330
When the most beautiful
Shadowhunter inside and out

21:11.330 --> 21:14.080
says she needs to see you,
who can refuse?

21:19.540 --> 21:21.170
What is it?

21:21.170 --> 21:24.620
Seelies have access to
dimensional doorways, right?

21:24.620 --> 21:25.540
Why do you ask?

21:26.620 --> 21:28.380
I need you to
get me into Edom.

21:33.670 --> 21:35.710
She said the Heavenly Fire
in her veins

21:35.710 --> 21:37.710
would shield her against
Edom's demonic atmosphere.

21:37.710 --> 21:39.540
Why would she take
that on herself?

21:39.540 --> 21:41.540
She didn't want all of you
putting your lives at risk.

21:41.540 --> 21:43.460
And you didn't try
to stop her from going?

21:43.460 --> 21:46.830
I did. But she convinced me it
was the only way to save Magnus.

21:49.420 --> 21:50.330
She begged me
not to tell you.

21:50.330 --> 21:52.250
Yet here you are.
I wanted

21:52.250 --> 21:54.670
to honour my word,
but the thought of Isabelle

21:54.670 --> 21:57.040
in danger, all alone

21:57.040 --> 21:58.460
I had to tell you.
Thank you,

21:58.460 --> 22:00.000
but what can we do?

22:01.670 --> 22:03.040
I have an idea.

22:03.040 --> 22:04.960
Hear me out.
Can you get

22:04.960 --> 22:06.750
all of us into Edom
through the Seelie Realm?

22:06.750 --> 22:08.620
I'm afraid not.

22:08.620 --> 22:11.420
My queen just sealed
our borders. I know not why.

22:11.420 --> 22:14.000
Even if we could, we'd die.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.580
We've been over that.

22:15.580 --> 22:17.670
What if I could create a rune
that binds Downworlders

22:17.670 --> 22:19.540
to Shadowhunters?

22:19.540 --> 22:21.620
We could share
skills, powers

22:21.620 --> 22:23.210
and immunities.

22:24.290 --> 22:26.920
Kind of like a temporary
Parabatai Rune.

22:26.920 --> 22:30.960
Look, bonding one Shadowhunter
to another that's one thing;

22:30.960 --> 22:33.580
this is different
and it's dangerous.

22:33.580 --> 22:35.330
You remember what happened
when you runed

22:35.330 --> 22:37.330
Valentine back to life?
I can make this work, Jace.

22:37.330 --> 22:39.580
We don't have any choice,
we're running out of time.

22:39.580 --> 22:42.000
If it's the only way to save
Izzy and Magnus, I think

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
it's worth a try.

...are absolute perfection.

24:35.210 --> 24:36.580
Lorenzo, I thank you for coming
on such short notice.

24:36.580 --> 24:38.710
Thank you for restoring me,
not that it changes anything

24:38.710 --> 24:42.790
between us. I'm here
for my fellow warlocks, not you.

24:42.790 --> 24:46.460
Ah, Meliorn,
envoy of the Queen.

24:46.460 --> 24:47.670
Good evening, Mr. Rey.

24:47.670 --> 24:50.120
And Mr. Lewis,

As my first act
on the Downworld Council,

25:02.790 --> 25:04.000
I move that we start
the proceedings without them.

and they never learn to heel.

a Council meeting.

I brought you here
to help us save Magnus

25:13.170 --> 25:14.710
and my sister.

25:15.790 --> 25:18.120
Help you save the warlock
who stood by

25:18.120 --> 25:19.920
and watched while his father
turned me into a reptile,

25:19.920 --> 25:23.580
left to dine
on dead flies?

25:23.580 --> 25:26.210
May your precious boyfriend
spend eternity in Edom.

25:26.210 --> 25:27.620
Goodbye and good riddance.

25:29.670 --> 25:31.830
If it weren't for me,

25:31.830 --> 25:33.330
you'd still be eating
dead flies.

25:37.290 --> 25:38.210
This isn't just

25:38.210 --> 25:39.290
about Magnus.

25:39.290 --> 25:40.670
It's about
Isabelle, too.

25:40.670 --> 25:43.120
And the fate of every other
living creature on the planet.

doesn't want to go first?

26:09.170 --> 26:10.290
No, thank you.

26:11.330 --> 26:13.670
Simon, it's gonna work.
I promise.

26:14.750 --> 26:15.960

before, Fray.

26:18.290 --> 26:19.290
Go ahead.

Ah!

26:35.250 --> 26:36.670

a lot of resistance.

26:36.670 --> 26:37.750
I go it.

26:37.750 --> 26:39.580
Angels wouldn't have
given me this power

if they didn't
want me to use it.

this will work?

It has to.

This is incredible.

27:26.330 --> 27:29.460

Clary gets vamp speed,

27:29.460 --> 27:31.000
and what do I get?
Pointy ears?

You'll learn my true powers next
time you take your lover to bed.

27:35.750 --> 27:38.880
Impressive, if I do
say so myself.

27:38.880 --> 27:41.250
And you're positive
this can get us into Edom?

27:41.250 --> 27:43.710
Not just in. Out too.

27:43.710 --> 27:46.750
Although it feels like a waste
to ignite such craftsmanship.

27:47.830 --> 27:50.080
Oh, I suppose thus is
the ephemeral nature

27:50.080 --> 27:51.920

we'll find Izzy and Magnus

27:54.790 --> 27:55.880
in the same Keep.

27:55.880 --> 27:57.500
Right. Where is
the Keep?

27:57.500 --> 28:00.500
We'll use the ring that Magnus
gave Alec to track him
once we arrive.

28:00.500 --> 28:02.920
OK. Everyone ready?
