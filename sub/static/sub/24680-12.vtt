The following story is fictional and
does not depict
any actual person or event.

00:07.268 --> 00:09.886
In New York City's war on crime,

00:09.886 --> 00:12.882
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:12.882 --> 00:14.805
of the Major Case Squad.

00:14.805 --> 00:17.095
These are their stories.

00:18.486 --> 00:23.114
Saints do not move,
though grant for prayer's sake.

00:23.114 --> 00:26.813
Then move not while
my prayer's effect I take.

00:28.307 --> 00:29.753
Uh, time.

00:30.700 --> 00:32.738
Problem, Romeo?

00:32.990 --> 00:35.304
It's like kissing my grandmother.
I can't.

00:35.304 --> 00:37.617
Try acting.

00:39.151 --> 00:40.515
Let's continue.

00:44.873 --> 00:48.706
Thus from my lips,
by thine my sin is purged.

00:48.706 --> 00:52.994
Then have my lips the sin
that they have took?

00:52.994 --> 00:56.198
Sin from my lips?
O trespass sweetly urged.

00:56.198 --> 00:58.669
Give me back my sin again.

01:01.932 --> 01:03.940
Good choice, Marion.

01:03.940 --> 01:07.889
A round of applause
for our brilliant Juliet.

He's all yours.

01:24.037 --> 01:28.534
Okay, Marion.
Chin down, no smile.

01:28.534 --> 01:31.908
You're sultry.
You eat men for lunch.

01:32.458 --> 01:34.038
Nice.

01:34.038 --> 01:36.716
Yes. Mm-hmm.

01:38.669 --> 01:40.546
Take a breather, sweetheart.

01:41.087 --> 01:43.009
I brought the final list.

01:43.009 --> 01:47.689
Uh, Marty Chapman agreed to emcee.

01:47.689 --> 01:49.182
I thought he wasn't available.

01:49.182 --> 01:50.937
No doesn't always mean no.

01:50.937 --> 01:52.976
I just need you to sign off on the budget.

01:52.976 --> 01:55.605
I'm bad with figures.
You know that.

01:56.686 --> 02:00.817
Harvey, all these famous people!

02:00.817 --> 02:02.945
You're a magician!

02:02.945 --> 02:04.745
It's only the beginning.

02:12.165 --> 02:14.955
I want full tox screens on every sample.

02:14.955 --> 02:18.169
Okay, folks. It's time to pick your pockets.

02:18.169 --> 02:20.919
So out with the checkbooks.
That's right.

02:20.919 --> 02:23.837
I want you to give till it hurts.

02:24.093 --> 02:27.714
Which for some of
you shouldn't take that long.

02:27.714 --> 02:30.639
She promised 35. We got 25.

02:30.639 --> 02:31.932
What's she trying to pull?

02:31.932 --> 02:34.516
Nothing, Stan.

02:34.516 --> 02:37.353
Just a misunderstanding.

02:37.353 --> 02:41.529
Now let's take a moment to say thank you
to our gorgeous hostess for the evening,

02:41.529 --> 02:43.531
Marion Whitney.

02:45.276 --> 02:46.945
Isn't she lovely?

02:46.945 --> 02:51.867
And she opened her beautiful home
for this worthy cause.

02:52.122 --> 02:53.700
But I would sincerely ask you all...

02:53.700 --> 02:56.663
- I need to see you in the library.
- Daniel, I'm in the middle of...

02:56.663 --> 02:59.710
There are two detectives here
about your husband.

02:59.710 --> 03:01.921
James? Tell them he passed away.

03:01.921 --> 03:05.507
That's why they're here.
They're saying he was murdered.

03:52.553 --> 03:55.019
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:  2004/01/18

03:58.019 --> 04:00.728
James wasn't poisoned.
He had emphysema.

04:00.728 --> 04:02.481
Everyone knows that's what killed him.

04:02.481 --> 04:06.113
Everyone except the medical examiner
who did the autopsy.

04:06.113 --> 04:08.570
You exhumed the body?
On what authority?

04:08.570 --> 04:12.363
A court order based on information in
a letter from an anonymous source.

04:12.363 --> 04:16.783
I would have thought the police knew
better than to put stock in an anonymous letter.

04:16.783 --> 04:21.290
I assume that since you didn't bother
to notify Mrs. Whitney of the exhumation

04:21.290 --> 04:23.501
that this letter also names her
as a suspect.

04:23.501 --> 04:26.881
Like you said, we know better than
to put stock in anonymous letters.

04:26.881 --> 04:29.541
"New York Gives A Damn."

04:29.541 --> 04:31.430
This is one of your late husband's causes?

04:31.430 --> 04:33.303
No. One of mine.

04:33.303 --> 04:35.721
You're interrupting
a very important evening.

04:35.721 --> 04:37.721
We can come back tomorrow.

04:37.721 --> 04:39.473
That would be so much better.

04:39.473 --> 04:40.937
Yeah. But since we're here...

04:40.937 --> 04:44.565
The death certificate says your husband
died in his sleep in the early evening.

04:44.565 --> 04:46.108
Who was here that day?

04:46.108 --> 04:49.274
The staff, my husband's nurse, Daniel...
There were lots of visitors.

04:49.274 --> 04:50.654
We'll need their names.

04:50.654 --> 04:53.575
Your husband was taking medications?

04:53.575 --> 04:55.201
For his blood pressure.

04:55.201 --> 04:57.953
And oxygen for his emphysema.

05:01.995 --> 05:04.505
That's, uh, Marty Chapman?

05:04.505 --> 05:07.045
My mom and I used to watch him
every Sunday night.

05:07.045 --> 05:10.797
If you behave, you can come and
listen to his monologue.

05:11.133 --> 05:13.090
We'd like that.

05:13.385 --> 05:17.846
The oxygen... It came through a tube
into his nose from a tank?

05:17.846 --> 05:21.058
Yes, from a tank, Detective.

05:21.058 --> 05:22.644
Please, are we done?

05:22.644 --> 05:25.312
You haven't asked what kind of poison
killed your husband.

05:25.312 --> 05:29.192
I mean, that's just what people usually ask.

05:29.192 --> 05:32.071
What? Are you accusing me?

05:32.071 --> 05:34.700
You're just distracted with the party.

05:34.700 --> 05:37.368
An organophosphate toxin.

05:40.079 --> 05:41.872
The poison.

05:42.875 --> 05:46.547
They've started dancing.
Daniel will give you the names.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.753
I'm sure this is all just an awful mistake.

05:48.753 --> 05:50.836
You must love dancing.

05:50.836 --> 05:53.839
You're just so light on your feet.

05:53.839 --> 05:56.303
I'm a student of the dance.

05:58.138 --> 06:00.933
Dance of the merry widow.

06:04.183 --> 06:06.768
Office Of Medical Examiner
Thursday, December 4

06:06.768 --> 06:08.103
And the tanks are sealed.

06:08.103 --> 06:12.738
So the trick was introducing the toxin
into the old guy's oxygen stream.

06:14.279 --> 06:17.240
Uh, the toxin... it vaporizes easily?

06:17.240 --> 06:20.619
Yeah. It's designed to.
It's an industrial pesticide.

06:22.327 --> 06:26.625
Well, if you mix it with a base, like, uh,
petroleum jelly?

06:26.625 --> 06:31.338
It would vaporize at a slower rate.
Death would take longer.

06:31.338 --> 06:35.889
You could coat the inside of the connector
with the toxin and petroleum jelly.

06:35.889 --> 06:40.095
Toxin would be released into the oxygen
as it passed into the breathing tube.

06:40.095 --> 06:43.262
Hmm. And you...

06:43.262 --> 06:46.854
hook him up for his nap,

06:48.019 --> 06:50.229
and it would be like he died in his sleep.

06:50.229 --> 06:54.276
Maybe you should talk to the kindly
person who tucked him in.

06:55.189 --> 06:57.947
Poisoned?
How's that possible?

06:57.947 --> 07:00.324
It was something he inhaled
through his nose.

07:00.324 --> 07:03.198
Then it must have come from
the oxygen tanks or the cannula.

07:03.198 --> 07:04.785
That's what we thought.

07:04.785 --> 07:08.043
We also thought that it was standard
procedure for the company

07:08.043 --> 07:10.501
that rents the equipment to pick it up.

07:10.501 --> 07:14.299
But you returned it yourself the
very next morning way up in Yonkers.

07:14.299 --> 07:16.008
The invoice says so.

07:16.008 --> 07:18.218
That was Mr. Whitney's idea.

07:18.218 --> 07:19.885
Since the rental place was
on my way home,

07:19.885 --> 07:22.224
he'd have me do it to save on delivery.

07:22.224 --> 07:26.232
Sounds like Mr. Whitney never met
a nickel he didn't like. / He was stingy.

07:26.232 --> 07:29.272
But his wife seems anything but.

07:29.272 --> 07:35.737
She was hosting a big-time fund-raiser
at her house the other night.

07:35.737 --> 07:37.317
She was?

07:37.317 --> 07:39.537
Good for her. She's having fun.

07:39.537 --> 07:42.450
She wasn't having fun when
Mr. Whitney was around?

07:42.450 --> 07:46.373
Hardly. She belonged to
this little singing group at the "Y,"

07:46.373 --> 07:48.250
something called Bound for Broadway.

07:48.250 --> 07:52.375
She'd have to sneak out to perform
at senior centers around the city.

07:52.375 --> 07:56.340
I have to get these meds upstairs.
Excuse me.

07:58.965 --> 08:03.180
Maybe singing wasn't the only thing
she was sneaking out for.

08:03.180 --> 08:08.061
The photo. That's her, uh,
cochair from her fund-raisers.

08:08.061 --> 08:12.646
Lawrence Bradley.
They look very cozy in that chair. / Hmm.

08:12.646 --> 08:15.232
Lawrence Bradley Acting Studio
17 West 37th Street
Friday, December 5

08:15.232 --> 08:17.111
What the hell are you imagining?

08:17.111 --> 08:19.488
I'm interested in her acting.

08:19.488 --> 08:22.282
I signed her on as a student four weeks ago.

08:22.282 --> 08:26.451
Do you have a lot of students
in their 60s? / No.

08:26.451 --> 08:28.211
Fifties? Forties?

08:28.211 --> 08:32.376
I'm guessing 25's the cutoff for
actresses. Twenty-six if they're pretty.

08:32.376 --> 08:33.962
You have no idea.

08:34.207 --> 08:38.883
I hold auditions. Students have to
show commitment and talent and...

08:38.883 --> 08:41.928
- A big bank account?
- I have no interest in that at all.

08:41.928 --> 08:46.182
Lincoln Center Awards, 1999 to 2003.

08:46.182 --> 08:48.770
- You have any former students on here?
- No.

08:48.770 --> 08:50.057
Just wishful thinking?

08:50.057 --> 08:52.146
Yes. Very good.
That's...

08:52.394 --> 08:53.353
That's what it is.

08:53.353 --> 08:55.105
I'm thinking you're mentoring students.

08:55.105 --> 08:57.727
You're cochairing fund-raisers.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.569
These are things that would impress...

09:00.569 --> 09:05.030
the Lincoln Center nominating
committee for service awards.

09:05.030 --> 09:07.953
And that's how Marion Whitney
got in your class.

09:07.953 --> 09:15.501
She's using her influence to wrangle
you up big-time recognition.

09:17.128 --> 09:21.921
I have no time for this,
and I certainly have no time for you.

09:21.921 --> 09:26.721
Marty showed such generosity taking
time away from his busy schedule.

09:26.721 --> 09:29.850
I really believe I made
a dear friend that night.

09:29.850 --> 09:31.853
Many dear friends.

09:31.853 --> 09:33.727
It was electric.

09:34.564 --> 09:36.900
All thanks to you, Harvey.

09:36.900 --> 09:41.528
This son of yours, Esther.
You are the luckiest woman alive.

09:42.194 --> 09:44.489
Oh, who can that be?

09:45.239 --> 09:48.367
I have to take this.
Please excuse me.

09:49.621 --> 09:51.662
"You are the luckiest woman alive."

09:51.662 --> 09:54.916
Ma, please!
I thought you would like her.

09:54.916 --> 09:56.547
Why should I?

09:56.547 --> 09:59.630
- You getting married?
- Of course not.

09:59.960 --> 10:03.591
Don't worry.
I have a pretty good idea who...

10:03.591 --> 10:06.429
We'll have our own autopsy.

10:07.343 --> 10:09.680
Daniel, this is my moment now.

10:09.680 --> 10:12.559
I will not tolerate obstacles.

10:16.519 --> 10:20.604
Money's just been flying out of her pocket...
dance lessons, voice coaches.

10:20.604 --> 10:22.818
She's servicing
a long-suppressed ambition.

10:22.818 --> 10:25.780
To star in the uptown
Y's production of Mame?

10:25.780 --> 10:28.290
Pretty slim motive to kill
your husband of 40 years.

10:28.290 --> 10:32.200
So far the only person who thinks
she did it is our anonymous letter writer.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.789
We getting any closer to
giving him a name?

10:33.789 --> 10:35.919
No prints, no saliva for D.N.A.

10:35.919 --> 10:38.629
The letter is just simply
declaratory sentences

10:38.629 --> 10:40.962
printed on a dot-matrix printer.

10:40.962 --> 10:43.131
You know, I've checked
a dozen databases.

10:43.131 --> 10:44.673
Until the fund-raiser last week,

10:44.673 --> 10:47.336
the Whitneys never came up
in connection with

10:47.336 --> 10:49.262
any charity works, or the arts,

10:49.262 --> 10:51.020
not even a mention
in the society pages.

10:51.020 --> 10:55.899
But all of a sudden, Marion Whitney's
hosting charity events, arranging awards

10:55.899 --> 10:59.565
This check for 10 grand...
Marion signed it,

10:59.565 --> 11:03.320
somebody else wrote in the amount,
and a third person wrote in the payee.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.275
Waste Management, Inc.

11:05.275 --> 11:08.323
Dated two weeks after her husband died.

11:08.323 --> 11:12.125
They gave you this address because
I'm Marty Chapman's business manager.

11:12.125 --> 11:16.252
Waste Management is what Marty
named his personal corporation.

11:16.252 --> 11:18.541
Because of all the crap
he's had to put up with.

11:18.541 --> 11:20.251
Oh, it's a joke.

11:21.087 --> 11:24.170
So why did Mrs. Whitney pay
Mr. Chapman $10,000?

11:24.170 --> 11:26.423
Actually, she paid him 35.

11:26.423 --> 11:29.135
This was the last payment.
We got it at the fund-raiser.

11:29.135 --> 11:32.848
- Apayment for what?
- To emcee the fund-raiser.

11:32.848 --> 11:36.394
You know, that check you got last week...

11:36.394 --> 11:38.268
It's dated six weeks ago.

11:38.268 --> 11:40.560
All I know is,
Harvey pulled it out of his pocket,

11:40.560 --> 11:42.315
filled in the amount and gave it to me.

11:42.315 --> 11:43.358
Who's Harvey?

11:43.358 --> 11:45.611
Harvey Gruenwald.
He produces charity events.

11:45.611 --> 11:49.037
And carries around blank checks
signed by Marion Whitney.

11:49.037 --> 11:52.701
"The Lincoln Center Awards."
I see you have tapes here.

11:52.701 --> 11:55.492
Dates all the way back to 1966.

11:55.492 --> 11:59.503
Every year, I have a few clients
on the nominating committee.

12:00.082 --> 12:03.168
You have some tapes missing.
You lend them to someone?

12:03.168 --> 12:05.051
Harvey borrowed them.

12:06.085 --> 12:09.466
He ever ask your help in getting
someone nominated?

12:09.466 --> 12:11.298
Say, Lawrence Bradley?

12:11.298 --> 12:14.014
He asked me to find out what
the committee was looking for.

12:14.014 --> 12:17.351
- He asked when?
- Maybe three months ago.

12:18.812 --> 12:21.063
Hello. / Hmm.
Before James Whitney died,

12:21.063 --> 12:25.358
Marion Whitney already had
Harvey plotting her new life.

12:25.358 --> 12:29.863
Yeah. / And maybe her husband's death.

12:31.778 --> 12:34.324
Murdered?
No. Marion didn't tell me.

12:34.324 --> 12:37.787
That's just... please...
so unexpected.

12:38.623 --> 12:40.499
Uh, who do you think did it?

12:40.499 --> 12:42.418
We're keeping an open mind.

12:42.418 --> 12:44.966
Did you speak to Mrs. Whitney that day?

12:44.966 --> 12:47.465
What, talk to her?
L-I was at the house.

12:47.465 --> 12:49.841
Right. Your name was on the list she gave us.

12:49.841 --> 12:51.632
And the purpose of your visit?

12:51.632 --> 12:55.221
Uh, to ask, um, Marion about
sponsoring a benefit.

12:55.221 --> 12:58.974
- How did you meet Mrs. Whitney?
- At a benefit.

12:58.974 --> 13:01.854
Don't ask me which one.
I'm always meeting new people.

13:01.854 --> 13:04.483
- Like all these people?
- Yes. Yes.

13:04.483 --> 13:08.778
That's me with Al, with Dusty,
Hill and Bill, with Liza.

13:08.778 --> 13:11.691
That's you and the governor
and the two mayors.

13:11.691 --> 13:14.287
Yes. That was at a benefit
for First Responders.

13:14.287 --> 13:16.619
Six months ago?
That was one of yours?

13:16.619 --> 13:18.996
- I was there.
- I hope you made a donation.

13:18.996 --> 13:21.203
Well, it was hard not to.

13:21.203 --> 13:24.626
So with all these close friends
in the acting profession,

13:24.626 --> 13:28.762
did it make it easier for you to get Marion
into Lawrence Bradley's acting class?

13:28.762 --> 13:31.465
All I did was get her an audition,
as a friend.

13:31.465 --> 13:34.010
Marion's wonderful talent did the rest.

13:34.010 --> 13:35.847
And as a friend,

13:35.847 --> 13:41.681
I'm sure you dangled a Lincoln Center
Award in front of Mr. Bradley.

13:41.681 --> 13:43.517
Where did you get that idea?

13:43.517 --> 13:45.523
From Marty Chapman's
business manager.

13:45.523 --> 13:48.440
You asked him
about the nominating procedures.

13:48.440 --> 13:49.360
I don't remember.

13:49.360 --> 13:52.151
But everything I do,
it's always as a friend.

13:52.151 --> 13:54.652
Look, l...

13:56.695 --> 14:00.575
Hel... Hi, Ma.

14:01.373 --> 14:03.497
Yes, I have your prescriptions.

14:03.497 --> 14:06.795
I'll bring them with me
when I pick you up at the center.

14:06.795 --> 14:09.919
You having fun?
Uh, yeah...

14:10.257 --> 14:13.546
Listen, Ma, I'm gonna have to
call you back. Love you.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.841
I like how you're so nice to your mother.

14:16.841 --> 14:20.638
She lives alone in Astoria.
I like her to check in.

14:20.638 --> 14:22.768
I have a meeting downtown.

14:22.768 --> 14:24.350
If you have any more questions,

14:24.350 --> 14:27.232
my secretary can schedule an appointment.

14:28.022 --> 14:31.527
Harvey Gruenwald's put on 11
major benefits in the last two years,

14:31.527 --> 14:33.233
all for well-known charities.

14:33.233 --> 14:35.573
So far, everyone I've talked to
says the same thing:

14:35.573 --> 14:38.409
He's irritating, but he gets the job done.

14:38.409 --> 14:41.037
Can't be easy getting people to part
with their time and money.

14:41.037 --> 14:42.987
I'm starting to see how he does it.

14:43.789 --> 14:47.040
Hubris and flattery... big part of it.

14:47.040 --> 14:50.541
And the facial tic... It's, uh, disarming.

14:50.541 --> 14:52.560
The more anxious he gets,
the worse it gets. / Oh, thanks.

14:52.560 --> 14:55.260
If it's like most simple motor tics,

14:55.260 --> 14:57.548
it's developed in early childhood.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.375
See what you missed?

14:59.375 --> 15:03.553
This is the check from the First
Responders benefit, front and back.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.724
Five hundred bucks?
Who's Terry?

15:06.724 --> 15:08.312
My date.

15:09.995 --> 15:14.334
What was I supposed to do while
I was pregnant? Sit home and knit?

15:14.334 --> 15:16.466
Check the endorsement.

15:17.324 --> 15:20.191
It was signed over to
a men's clothing store.

15:20.360 --> 15:23.308
We applied that check to this invoice.
There's still a balance due.

15:23.308 --> 15:25.175
Five thousand dollars worth of ties?

15:25.175 --> 15:28.687
They were party favors for celebrities
at one of his benefits.

15:29.867 --> 15:34.236
What's this notation here:
"Animal patterns only"?

15:34.236 --> 15:37.052
Oh, the theme of the benefit was
endangered Asian wildlife.

15:37.052 --> 15:40.658
No, see, the theme of this benefit was
endangered rescue workers.

15:40.658 --> 15:41.960
Last July?

15:41.960 --> 15:44.652
Well, the wildlife benefit was in May.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.203
We stopped working with him.

15:46.203 --> 15:50.000
We've heard he's been stiffing people
left and right since last spring.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.777
- Can we get a copy of this invoice?
- Sure.

15:53.265 --> 15:56.817
So Harvey's having to rob
Peter to pay the pandas.

15:56.817 --> 15:59.627
How lucky for him Marion Whitney
dropped into his lap.

15:59.627 --> 16:00.888
Lucky?

16:00.888 --> 16:03.966
He told us that he met her at a benefit.

16:05.979 --> 16:09.909
She didn't attend benefits
before her husband died.

16:09.909 --> 16:12.318
Maybe her singing group from the "Y"...

16:12.318 --> 16:14.926
performed at a senior center in Astoria.

16:14.926 --> 16:17.178
Oh, yes. Bound for Broadway.

16:17.178 --> 16:18.982
They come here regularly.

16:18.982 --> 16:20.958
Our seniors enjoy it.

16:20.958 --> 16:24.001
Of course, it helps
they're a little hard of hearing.

16:24.001 --> 16:26.446
And Marion Whitney's always
a part of the show?

16:26.446 --> 16:30.099
Oh, sure. We all get a big kick out of her.

16:30.099 --> 16:34.886
She rolls up in her chauffeur-driven Bentley,

16:34.886 --> 16:37.463
and the whole singing group on board.

16:39.323 --> 16:42.723
Um, is there a Mrs. Gruenwald
that comes here?

16:42.723 --> 16:45.278
Gruenwald.
Oh, Esther. Yes.

16:45.278 --> 16:47.908
- She has a son? Harvey?
- Mm-hmm.

16:47.908 --> 16:50.802
Now, does he ever accompany
her to Mrs. Whitney's shows?

16:50.802 --> 16:52.548
Once or twice, yes.

16:52.548 --> 16:54.227
He's a wonderful young man.

16:54.227 --> 16:56.794
You ever see him chat up Mrs. Whitney?

16:57.378 --> 16:59.505
Yes. The last time she was here.

16:59.505 --> 17:02.423
Oh, that must have been
three months ago.

17:02.423 --> 17:03.701
Harvey came alone.

17:03.701 --> 17:05.597
He said his mother was
under the weather.

17:05.597 --> 17:09.559
And after the show, I saw him ask
Mrs. Whitney for her autograph.

17:09.559 --> 17:14.102
Uh, these were, um, done
on a computer here?

17:14.102 --> 17:17.898
Yes. We have donated equipment
that our seniors can use.

17:17.898 --> 17:22.738
- Including a dot-matrix printer.
- Yes.

17:23.159 --> 17:25.864
Home Of Esther Gruenwald
Queens, New York
Tuesday, December 9

17:25.864 --> 17:29.161
I have to take my nap.
I don't have time for you now.

17:29.161 --> 17:31.332
Anyway, Harvey doesn't live here anymore.

17:31.332 --> 17:33.874
He has a hideaway bed in his office.

17:33.874 --> 17:35.335
But he sleeps over sometimes.

17:35.335 --> 17:39.091
Uh, there's a quilt and
a pillow on that couch.

17:39.091 --> 17:42.542
You can see it just fine from right here.

17:42.717 --> 17:44.927
Yes, he sleeps over.

17:44.927 --> 17:49.562
It's easy for him.
No wife, no kids, no life.

17:49.562 --> 17:51.566
You don't think much of his charity work?

17:51.566 --> 17:55.061
It's not like he's out
in the jungle healing the lepers.

17:55.061 --> 17:58.983
He plans parties, for God's sakes.
A grown man.

17:58.983 --> 18:01.319
But important people support
what he does...

18:01.319 --> 18:05.824
um, Marty Chapman, Marion Whitney.

18:06.283 --> 18:09.411
He thinks they care about him.
They don't care.

18:09.411 --> 18:13.171
How could they? I mean, he sweats,
and that thing with his face.

18:13.171 --> 18:15.417
Well, they take advantage ofhis good nature.

18:15.417 --> 18:18.085
- It wouldn't surprise me.
- Marion Whitney, for example.

18:18.085 --> 18:19.920
We hear she's got him on a short leash.

18:19.920 --> 18:23.964
He's not here five minutes,
she's calling him.

18:23.964 --> 18:26.595
Her husband died not too long ago.

18:26.595 --> 18:27.889
He was poisoned.

18:27.889 --> 18:29.472
You know how we found out?

18:30.517 --> 18:33.810
A good citizen sent us a letter
with valuable information.

18:33.810 --> 18:36.648
Valuable up-up to a point.

18:36.648 --> 18:39.857
We need this good citizen to tell us
what they know.

18:40.235 --> 18:43.276
- That smell... Is that coffee?
- Mmm.

18:43.276 --> 18:47.156
Yeah, I only made enough for one cup.

18:47.156 --> 18:49.701
You are tough, Mrs. Gruenwald,

18:49.701 --> 18:53.079
'cause normally Detective Eames and I,
we'd be in the living room by now.

18:53.079 --> 18:55.495
I told you I don't have time for you.

18:55.495 --> 18:58.918
I don't say things just to hear myself talk.

18:59.628 --> 19:02.802
We'll leave our card, just in case.

19:03.212 --> 19:05.636
Your hands sweat.
No, l... You wiped your hands.

19:05.636 --> 19:08.010
I don't mean to embarrass you.
It's just, um...

19:08.010 --> 19:12.305
It's a side effect of medications
that you take?

19:12.305 --> 19:15.058
Same thing happened to my mother
when she took her medications.

19:15.058 --> 19:17.354
It's the pills I take for my headaches.

19:17.354 --> 19:19.439
Headaches? Butalbital?

19:19.439 --> 19:21.358
My mom used to take that.

19:21.358 --> 19:24.110
Yeah, well, I'm still takin' it.

19:25.863 --> 19:28.906
If she wrote the letter, she blamed
Marion Whitney for the murder.

19:28.906 --> 19:31.034
- Isn't Harvey your suspect?
- Maybe.

19:31.034 --> 19:34.454
But the mother is jealous of the attention
that he lavishes on Marion.

19:34.454 --> 19:37.208
She might've written the letter
to get rid of Marion.

19:37.583 --> 19:40.338
Whatever cards this old gal's holding,

19:40.338 --> 19:42.421
you need to get her to show 'em to you.

19:42.421 --> 19:44.337
And a dot-matrix printer isn't gonna do it.

19:44.337 --> 19:45.426
Well, maybe this will.

19:45.426 --> 19:48.844
The lab found
traces of Butalbital in the letter.

19:48.844 --> 19:51.804
It's secreted through the sweat
on Mrs. Gruenwald's hands.

19:51.804 --> 19:53.848
Call Carver.
Get a subpoena.

20:00.904 --> 20:02.566
Thank you so much for coming.

20:02.566 --> 20:03.691
Thank you.

20:04.843 --> 20:07.112
Harvey, what are you doing in there?

20:07.112 --> 20:08.405
Ma, I'm busy.

20:08.405 --> 20:11.158
I have to tell you something.

20:15.062 --> 20:16.539
What do you wanna tell me?

20:16.539 --> 20:19.123
The police came by this morning.

20:19.123 --> 20:20.874
They asked me about
that Whitney woman.

20:20.874 --> 20:23.003
They think she killed her husband.

20:23.003 --> 20:25.796
That's ridiculous.
Why would they want to ask you?

20:25.796 --> 20:28.515
I don't know.
You be careful around her.

20:28.515 --> 20:31.553
You're so impressed with her,
you'd do anything she tells you.

20:31.553 --> 20:33.348
She's not your friend.

20:33.348 --> 20:34.598
Come on. Don't be like that.

20:34.598 --> 20:36.266
Not one of them, Harvey.

20:36.266 --> 20:38.933
You go ahead, have your picture
taken with them all you want.

20:38.933 --> 20:40.775
That doesn't mean they respect you.

20:40.775 --> 20:44.686
How would you know?
You never once...

20:52.406 --> 20:54.616
I'll see you in the morning, Ma.

21:04.878 --> 21:08.839
Mrs. Gruenwald?
This is Detectives Eames and Goren.

21:13.387 --> 21:16.729
This is Unit 229.
We have a 10-54. Female down.

21:16.729 --> 21:19.848
4562 Steinway, Apartment 4-F.

21:19.848 --> 21:22.726
Central, put a rush on that, "K."

21:28.027 --> 21:30.861
Bed sheets are turned down.
Box of crackers on the nightstand.

21:30.861 --> 21:33.655
She was probably in bed
when she heard an intruder.

21:33.655 --> 21:35.777
She's got a chipped tooth.

21:41.041 --> 21:42.372
Got it.

21:42.372 --> 21:44.710
- Well, let's mark that.
- Yes, sir.

21:50.964 --> 21:53.304
All right. There's a nick.

21:58.055 --> 22:03.270
Well, the perp didn't want to break in
unless he was sure where she was.

22:04.310 --> 22:08.527
He opened the lock, rang the doorbell.

22:08.527 --> 22:10.900
When she got to the door...

22:11.238 --> 22:13.741
Smash in her face.
The rest was easy.

22:13.741 --> 22:14.944
Here we go.

22:14.944 --> 22:17.284
- There's a chipped tooth there.
- Yeah.

22:17.284 --> 22:18.159
Victim's here. / Okay.

22:18.159 --> 22:20.123
What are you doing here?

22:20.123 --> 22:21.704
Where's my mother?

22:22.372 --> 22:24.088
You can't go in there.
It's a crime scene.

22:24.088 --> 22:25.961
What kind of a crime?
What are you talking about?

22:25.961 --> 22:28.505
Your mother was murdered last night.
We're very sorry.

22:28.505 --> 22:30.044
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

22:30.044 --> 22:31.335
Ma! Ma!

22:31.335 --> 22:35.842
I should have stayed with her last night
after the burglary downstairs.

22:35.842 --> 22:37.595
We don't think this was a burglary.

22:37.595 --> 22:40.725
We think someone came in to kill her.

22:45.313 --> 22:47.856
A-Are you all right?
Do you need a drink of water?

22:47.856 --> 22:51.360
No. It's this suit.
I rented it at the last minute.

22:51.360 --> 22:53.279
This is the only size that they had.

22:53.279 --> 22:54.694
You had a benefit last night?

22:54.694 --> 22:57.868
No. It was the opening night of
the Sinatra thing at Radio City.

22:57.868 --> 22:59.368
I went with Mrs. Whitney.

22:59.368 --> 23:01.327
We think your mother sent us a letter

23:01.327 --> 23:04.249
accusing Marion Whitney of
poisoning her husband.

23:04.249 --> 23:08.169
No. No. Ma liked Marion.

23:08.418 --> 23:10.171
That's not the impression she gave us.

23:10.171 --> 23:12.297
Well, Ma has her own way
of showing affection.

23:12.297 --> 23:13.965
You don't know her.

23:14.799 --> 23:19.299
I have to, uh, make some calls to relatives.

23:19.299 --> 23:23.016
I'll be at my office.
Thank you so much for coming.

23:23.854 --> 23:27.605
Harvey nearly swallowed his face
when we told him it wasn't a burglary.

23:27.605 --> 23:29.106
You confirm his alibi for last night?

23:29.106 --> 23:33.068
Two ushers at Radio City saw him
sitting next to Marion Whitney.

23:33.068 --> 23:37.406
Harvey was genuinely shaken
about his mother's death.

23:37.406 --> 23:41.616
And afraid. Now something's
inspiring that fear.

23:41.616 --> 23:43.703
Maybe it's the fact that
he owes money everywhere.

23:43.703 --> 23:46.998
What's he doing with these funds
he collects at these benefits?

23:46.998 --> 23:49.416
The charities say he turns over
about 10 percent to them.

23:49.416 --> 23:52.460
The rest he claims for expenses.
But he's not spending it on himself.

23:52.460 --> 23:54.880
He bunks in his office or
on his mother's couch.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.468
- He even rents his tux.
- Then where's the money going?

23:57.468 --> 23:58.528
Maybe the question to ask is,

23:58.528 --> 24:00.928
where did Harvey get the money
from in the first place?

24:00.928 --> 24:04.394
These benefits, they cost hundreds
of thousands of dollars to put on.

24:04.394 --> 24:07.018
What was he doing before
he started hitting up socialites?

24:07.018 --> 24:08.313
Driving them.

24:08.313 --> 24:11.686
Three years ago,
Harvey worked for a limousine company.

24:12.148 --> 24:14.064
Viceroy Limousine 81 10th Avenue
Thursday, December 11

24:14.064 --> 24:16.446
Harvey was a driver.
He had terrific people skills.

24:16.446 --> 24:19.031
- People skills? What kind?
- It's the damnedest thing.

24:19.031 --> 24:21.574
Whenever he drove famous people around,
he'd come home with an autograph,

24:21.574 --> 24:24.078
or even a picture with them,
without pissing them off.

24:24.078 --> 24:26.253
Which isn't easy, let me tell you.

24:26.253 --> 24:28.246
Well, maybe it's his tic.

24:28.246 --> 24:31.041
You know, people feel
they can't say no to him.

24:31.041 --> 24:32.833
You gotta use what God gave you.

24:32.833 --> 24:36.926
God didn't give Harvey the seed money
for his fund-raising business, did he?

24:36.926 --> 24:40.175
No. I did.
The kid discovered a secret.

24:40.175 --> 24:42.137
You offer a celebrity enough money,

24:42.137 --> 24:44.388
they'll show up pretty much
wherever you want 'em to.

24:44.388 --> 24:46.848
- We've heard that.
- It's true.

24:46.848 --> 24:48.225
Let me show you.

24:48.644 --> 24:50.021
That's my daughter's wedding.

24:50.021 --> 24:51.979
See who I'm standing next to?

24:51.979 --> 24:54.358
Looks a lot like Charleton Heston.

24:54.358 --> 24:56.653
Well, Harvey was driving him.
He knew I was a big fan.

24:56.653 --> 24:59.903
The next thing you know, I got Moses
doing the invocation at my daughter's wedding.

24:59.903 --> 25:03.241
And it only cost me 10 grand. / Oh.

25:03.493 --> 25:05.828
- Do you mind if I get a drink of water?
- Be my guest.

25:05.828 --> 25:06.996
So how does it work?

25:06.996 --> 25:09.247
Harvey takes a cut from the fund-raising

25:09.247 --> 25:11.623
to cover his overhead,
and you take a cut of that?

25:11.623 --> 25:14.582
It's notjust the money. I'm thinking
about getting into the music business.

25:14.582 --> 25:17.798
And thanks to Harvey,
I've made some great contacts.

25:17.798 --> 25:20.049
Cut crystal.

25:20.049 --> 25:22.927
And there's a lot of them.

25:24.429 --> 25:27.766
They're for the limos. Apal of mine
owns a glassware company.

25:27.766 --> 25:29.309
Crystal Needs.

25:29.309 --> 25:32.521
That's where Harvey rents
his glasses for his fund-raisers.

25:32.521 --> 25:35.113
Harvey rent from any other pals of yours?

25:35.113 --> 25:36.398
Pal of mine's in the linen business.

25:36.398 --> 25:38.283
Another pal of mine
rents tables and chairs.

25:38.283 --> 25:41.904
Harvey keeps a lot of your "pals"
in business.

25:44.240 --> 25:47.121
The start-up money, Mr. Weaver...

25:47.121 --> 25:51.164
It was a loan.
A high-interest loan.

25:51.164 --> 25:52.917
We have a legal binding contract.

25:52.917 --> 25:56.792
Secured by these pals of yours
in the wedding photo?

25:56.792 --> 26:03.970
Besides Moses, I see Carmine Masucci,
Tony Virgini, Mike Tobis.

26:03.970 --> 26:06.060
You guys are bleeding Harvey dry,
aren't you?

26:06.060 --> 26:07.765
How much does he owe you?

26:07.765 --> 26:09.643
We're up to date.

26:09.643 --> 26:11.775
Harvey cut me a nice check last month.

26:11.775 --> 26:13.310
Last month?

26:13.936 --> 26:20.034
Then this little angel floated down
from heaven to save Harvey.

26:20.901 --> 26:25.616
"To Nicholas,
with warm regards. Marion."

26:25.616 --> 26:27.575
Another pal of yours?

26:27.575 --> 26:29.200
Now she is.

26:30.868 --> 26:34.582
It's her money.
She's free to do with it what she wants,

26:34.582 --> 26:37.753
even if it means helping
Mr. Gruenwald repay a business debt.

26:37.753 --> 26:40.044
A $500,000 debt?

26:40.044 --> 26:42.715
Did he tell you who he owed it to?

26:42.715 --> 26:45.133
His partner, Mr. Weaver.

26:45.133 --> 26:48.097
Uh, Nicholas "Nickie Boy" Weaver.

26:49.553 --> 26:54.435
He's a loan shark with ties
to various crime organizations.

26:54.435 --> 26:59.608
Harvey was desperate to meet
his obligation to him.

26:59.608 --> 27:04.906
That's why he made a point of running
into you at the senior center.

27:04.906 --> 27:07.330
That's why he killed your husband.

27:07.780 --> 27:10.076
I don't believe that for a minute.

27:10.869 --> 27:12.786
And it's why his mother's dead.

27:12.786 --> 27:14.454
She wrote letters to the police.

27:14.454 --> 27:17.918
She posed a threat to
Mr. Weaver's investment.

27:17.918 --> 27:20.546
What do you expect my client to do
about all this?

27:20.546 --> 27:23.754
We need her help making a case
against Mr. Gruenwald.

27:23.754 --> 27:25.426
You're wrong about Harvey.

27:25.426 --> 27:28.308
Well, we're not wrong about Nick Weaver.

27:28.308 --> 27:32.014
Once he's wrung every last dime
out of Harvey,

27:32.014 --> 27:33.971
it'll be your turn.

27:35.181 --> 27:39.315
You hear that, Daniel?
He's trying to scare me.

27:39.315 --> 27:43.192
You really are a poor judge of
character, Detective.

27:43.192 --> 27:45.237
Well, if you'll excuse me.

27:45.237 --> 27:50.081
Well, you're a hard character to
pin down, Mrs. Whitney.

27:50.281 --> 27:53.538
You know, I was surprised finding
your autographed photo

27:53.538 --> 27:56.247
hanging in a mobster's office.

28:00.711 --> 28:02.844
That wasn't the face of a friendly witness.

28:02.844 --> 28:05.423
Gruenwald's got her hook, line and sinker.

28:05.423 --> 28:07.968
She refuses to see who she's dealing with.

28:07.968 --> 28:10.094
We should've showed her Esther's autopsy.

28:10.094 --> 28:13.307
Her killer practically ripped her arm
off dragging her to the couch.

28:13.307 --> 28:17.650
I think that Marion sees very clearly
who she's dealing with.

28:18.854 --> 28:22.565
But she seems to be pursuing her
own agenda.

28:24.067 --> 28:26.526
This says that Harvey's mother
had scarring on her lungs.

28:26.526 --> 28:30.113
Right. Consistent with a case of
bronchial asthma four years ago.

28:30.113 --> 28:34.784
Well, I wonder what kind of inhalation
therapy they gave her.

28:35.538 --> 28:38.123
Yeah, that's right.
That's very nice.

28:38.123 --> 28:41.868
Harvey... Harvey,
you cannot dwell.

28:42.501 --> 28:45.631
I keep seeing her.
It's... It's all my fault.

28:45.631 --> 28:46.965
That isn't true.

28:46.965 --> 28:49.506
You know, we can give
a benefit in her memory.

28:49.506 --> 28:52.052
- What was her favorite charity?
- I don't know.

28:52.052 --> 28:54.553
We'll think of something appropriate.

28:54.553 --> 28:56.732
That's how you deal with loss.

28:56.732 --> 28:59.515
You fling yourself back into life.

29:00.646 --> 29:03.858
This'll knock 'em back on their heels.

29:03.858 --> 29:06.150
What do you say?

29:08.116 --> 29:10.612
This is how she treated her asthma.

29:12.070 --> 29:15.701
- The medication goes in here?
- Yeah.

29:17.953 --> 29:23.921
And then it's, uh, vaporized
and inhaled through here.

29:23.921 --> 29:27.091
Somebody took it apart to see
how it worked.

29:37.139 --> 29:40.059
Petroleum jelly.
There are specks.

29:41.890 --> 29:43.733
Cinnamon?

29:45.853 --> 29:49.945
Well, Harvey mixed 'em together
to test to see if the...

29:49.945 --> 29:54.366
The smell would be released
when the vapor passed through it.

29:54.700 --> 29:56.826
That's how he got the idea to
kill James Whitney.

29:56.826 --> 29:59.910
Well, let's go give him a science prize.

30:00.412 --> 30:01.963
- Then I can count on you?
- Okay, Harvey.

30:01.963 --> 30:03.500
We can't do this without you.

30:03.500 --> 30:04.917
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah. Bye-bye. / Harvey Gruenwald.

30:04.917 --> 30:07.629
Mr. Gruenwald, you're under arrest
for the murder of James Whitney.

30:07.629 --> 30:09.882
Please. No.
Not in front of all these people.

30:09.882 --> 30:11.715
Believe me, Harvey, they've seen worse.

30:11.715 --> 30:13.011
Harvey, this way.

30:13.802 --> 30:15.135
Done?

30:19.930 --> 30:22.727
I told you.
I never touched Ma's medical stuff.

30:22.727 --> 30:26.738
So you can't tell us how your
greasy little fingerprints

30:26.738 --> 30:28.566
got all over the inside of this gizmo?

30:28.566 --> 30:32.862
Uh, Ma might've asked me to fix it.

30:32.862 --> 30:35.869
With petroleum jelly? Why?
The little motor was squeaking?

30:35.869 --> 30:37.952
It was an experiment, wasn't it, Harvey?

30:37.952 --> 30:39.493
Before you...

30:40.495 --> 30:47.376
Well, before you moved on to
James Whitney, oxygen tank, the poison.

30:47.376 --> 30:50.003
I didn't have anything to do with that.
I didn't kill him.

30:50.003 --> 30:53.009
No, see, this proves that you did,
and we know why you did.

30:53.009 --> 30:55.554
Your partner, Nickie Boy,
was squeezing you.

30:55.554 --> 30:58.512
He's the big fish, Harvey.
That's who we want.

30:58.512 --> 31:00.224
What are you people trying to do?

31:00.224 --> 31:02.810
Get a mob loan shark off the street.

31:02.810 --> 31:07.150
He put you up to killing Mr. Whitney.

31:07.150 --> 31:09.397
And then he killed your mother.

31:09.397 --> 31:10.818
He knew you'd be out.

31:10.818 --> 31:12.320
Tha-That's not true.

31:12.320 --> 31:14.238
I never told him I was going out.

31:14.238 --> 31:18.032
Well, the tux... It was tight, right?

31:18.032 --> 31:19.662
That's because you rented it last minute,

31:19.662 --> 31:22.662
because that's how you got the tickets
to Radio City last minute.

31:22.662 --> 31:24.122
Yes. I had to rush around.

31:24.122 --> 31:26.791
I didn't have time to call Nick or anybody.

31:27.417 --> 31:30.294
I'm George Salinas. I've been retained
to represent Mr. Gruenwald.

31:30.294 --> 31:31.671
My client's invoking.

31:31.671 --> 31:34.262
The person who invited you...
That was Marion?

31:34.262 --> 31:36.299
Yes. / That's enough.

31:38.386 --> 31:40.723
Harvey's not taking us seriously.

31:40.723 --> 31:43.097
He will when the judge denies him bail.

31:43.097 --> 31:45.935
- I'm asking for remand.
- Based on a nebulizer?

31:45.935 --> 31:50.398
Based on his misappropriation of charitable
donations and on two murder counts.

31:50.398 --> 31:53.066
I'm charging him for his mother's death.

31:53.066 --> 31:56.228
Send him over for arraignment
when you're ready.

31:57.572 --> 32:02.617
You know, opening night tickets for
Radio City couldn't be easy to get.

32:02.617 --> 32:05.744
I'd like to find out how Marion
snagged 'em.

32:05.999 --> 32:09.458
Arraignment Court
Tuesday, December 16

32:09.458 --> 32:10.879
Not guilty.

32:10.879 --> 32:13.171
Your Honor, the People ask for remand.

32:13.171 --> 32:16.088
Your Honor, Mr. Gruenwald's prepared
to post a million dollars

32:16.088 --> 32:17.841
to guarantee his appearance at trial.

32:17.841 --> 32:21.968
Your Honor, we have two elderly
victims callously murdered.

32:21.968 --> 32:25.100
Your Honor, we're prepared to
post two million dollars.

32:25.100 --> 32:29.355
Mr. Gruenwald is a flight risk with
no residential address in the city.

32:29.355 --> 32:32.649
We'll post three million dollars and
agree to an ankle bracelet.

32:32.649 --> 32:34.526
He'll go to work. He'll go home.
Nothing else.

32:34.526 --> 32:38.280
He can have crossed five states before
anyone notices he's missing.

32:38.280 --> 32:39.867
Your Honor, if bail is granted today,

32:39.867 --> 32:44.326
we won't object if Mr. Carver
wants to revisit the issue in a week.

32:44.743 --> 32:47.872
I don't see how I can say no.

32:47.872 --> 32:49.791
Bail is three million.

32:49.791 --> 32:52.459
Defendant will be fitted
with a monitoring device,

32:52.459 --> 32:55.338
and I want him back here next week.

32:55.338 --> 32:56.630
Next case.

32:56.630 --> 32:58.507
Now I know what a cattle auction feels like.

32:58.507 --> 33:01.972
Harvey's lawyer was taking
his bidding cues from Marion Whitney.

33:01.972 --> 33:04.381
She wants him out for this week.

33:04.381 --> 33:06.390
She needs him for something.

33:06.390 --> 33:09.478
You have full access to
Mr. Gruenwald's records.

33:09.478 --> 33:11.441
See what he's up to.

33:12.309 --> 33:17.108
The Kathleen Karr Project is a program
we run for underprivileged kids.

33:17.108 --> 33:19.321
Mr. Gruenwald made
a generous contribution.

33:19.321 --> 33:20.489
We saw the check.

33:20.489 --> 33:23.580
We also saw your address
on an invoice from a florist.

33:23.580 --> 33:26.869
Mr. Gruenwald's having a boatload
of roses delivered here next Monday.

33:26.869 --> 33:29.205
I'm letting him use the theater
for a little show he's producing.

33:29.205 --> 33:31.832
A little show starring Marion Whitney.

33:31.832 --> 33:34.921
The audience...
Do you know who's coming?

33:34.921 --> 33:37.804
Gruenwald faxed me the list last week.

33:37.804 --> 33:40.342
I recognize some of the names
on the first page.

33:40.342 --> 33:42.717
They're a little creaky.

33:42.717 --> 33:44.686
I recognize some of these names too.

33:44.686 --> 33:48.057
I heard Gruenwald tell her
all the guests were A-list people.

33:48.057 --> 33:49.816
You've met Mrs. Whitney?

33:49.816 --> 33:51.854
She came in for a lighting rehearsal.

33:51.854 --> 33:53.689
I bet she was excited.

33:53.689 --> 33:54.898
I couldn't figure her out.

33:54.898 --> 33:56.815
One minute she seemed out of her depth,

33:56.815 --> 34:00.111
the next she sounded like
she had greasepaint in her veins.

34:00.111 --> 34:01.571
Uh, for example?

34:01.571 --> 34:04.330
She asked for side shin lighting.

34:04.330 --> 34:07.372
I told her that's mostly for
dancers to highlight their legs,

34:07.372 --> 34:10.161
but, uh, no dancing in her show.

34:10.161 --> 34:13.089
Uh, you said "mostly."
What else are they used for?

34:13.089 --> 34:14.754
For children.

34:15.501 --> 34:17.754
- Where on earth did you find this?
- Actors Equity.

34:17.754 --> 34:19.795
They had it under her maiden name.

34:19.795 --> 34:22.007
This photo must be from the '50s.

34:22.007 --> 34:23.886
Actors Equity keep them that long?

34:23.886 --> 34:25.679
As long as you pay your dues.

34:25.679 --> 34:28.474
She was 12 years old when
she played her last bit part.

34:28.474 --> 34:29.976
Long time to hold on to a dream.

34:29.976 --> 34:32.809
Come Monday, she's hoping to
prove it was worth it.

34:32.809 --> 34:37.022
And this is why she needs
Mr. Gruenwald out of jail till then.

34:37.857 --> 34:40.112
I'd prefer we had all three of them.

34:40.112 --> 34:41.860
You might get your wish,

34:41.860 --> 34:48.156
once Harvey and Marion see how they
fail to live up to each other's expectations.

34:48.156 --> 34:52.830
Come, you spirits that tend
on mortal thoughts.

34:52.830 --> 34:59.293
Unsex me here and fill me
From the crown to the toe.

34:59.293 --> 35:02.431
Harvey. Harvey, who's in the front row?

35:02.431 --> 35:04.632
I'm still juggling.
There are people coming from London.

35:04.632 --> 35:06.120
I want to keep the center seats for them.

35:06.120 --> 35:08.012
London? Harvey, you're my rock.

35:08.012 --> 35:11.932
Larry, I think I should be nearer
to the edge of the stage.

35:11.932 --> 35:15.735
I want to fix them with my eyes.
I want to frighten them.

35:15.735 --> 35:17.019
Take my word for it, Marion.

35:17.019 --> 35:19.983
If they're here tonight,
they'll be frightened.

35:20.524 --> 35:22.610
Come... / There he is.

35:23.316 --> 35:25.363
My partner thought you skipped.

35:25.363 --> 35:27.706
I'm sorry. This is a closed rehearsal.

35:27.706 --> 35:32.786
Sorry, but we need to make sure
Mr. Gruenwald is complying with his bail.

35:32.786 --> 35:36.290
Still wearing your ankle monitor,
aren't you? / Yeah, I am.

35:36.290 --> 35:38.466
There it is. Still ticking.

35:38.466 --> 35:40.836
Harvey and I have important work to do.

35:40.836 --> 35:42.381
You know...

35:42.381 --> 35:46.098
You know, you guys are lucky
to have found each other.

35:46.098 --> 35:48.178
I know. Thank you.

35:48.178 --> 35:53.015
It's hard to say who's luckier...
you or Harvey.

35:53.015 --> 35:54.475
I'd say Harvey.

35:54.475 --> 35:56.820
Before he met you, Mrs. Whitney,

35:56.820 --> 36:01.197
he was being skinned alive
by Nick Weaver.

36:01.480 --> 36:04.611
You know, your arrangement
with Nick Weaver...

36:04.611 --> 36:08.321
Even on a good month,
it's hand-to-mouth.

36:08.321 --> 36:09.868
Oh, I don't do this to get rich.

36:09.868 --> 36:12.953
Well, you're not doing it to
get poor though, either, are ya?

36:12.953 --> 36:15.040
It's the celebrities.

36:15.789 --> 36:18.125
Getting your picture taken with them.

36:18.125 --> 36:20.545
Being on a first-name basis.

36:20.545 --> 36:24.004
Well, it makes you... important.

36:24.004 --> 36:26.174
No. No. / Come on.
It shows that you have value.

36:26.174 --> 36:29.050
It proved it to your mother.
Oh, sure it did. / No.

36:29.050 --> 36:32.764
We found the autographed photos
that you gave your mother.

36:33.142 --> 36:36.267
"A terrific kid."

36:36.856 --> 36:39.020
"What a great kid."

36:41.062 --> 36:46.820
I mean, if Dino and Jack say so,
then Mom has to believe it's true.

36:46.820 --> 36:49.488
I didn't tell them to write this.

36:49.488 --> 36:52.952
Harvey, this need,

36:52.952 --> 36:55.746
this pathological need...

36:55.746 --> 36:59.373
It's what got you into deep trouble
with Nick Weaver.

36:59.373 --> 37:02.127
You didn't want to believe
he killed your husband,

37:02.127 --> 37:04.171
but now we have proof.

37:04.171 --> 37:07.299
We found this in his mother's apartment.

37:07.678 --> 37:11.384
He practiced on it before tampering
with your husband's oxygen tank.

37:11.384 --> 37:14.681
- Oh, that's-that's not true, Marion.
- I know.

37:14.681 --> 37:18.311
Don't worry, Harvey.
Marion doesn't care if you killed James.

37:18.311 --> 37:20.188
It gave her an opportunity of a lifetime.

37:20.188 --> 37:24.234
- Fifty years, to be exact.
- That's exactly how long

37:24.234 --> 37:27.610
little Marion Lester's been
waiting by the stage door.

37:27.610 --> 37:31.402
My God! Where did you get this old thing?

37:33.823 --> 37:38.330
You see, Harvey, you need
the approval of one special person.

37:38.330 --> 37:40.625
But Marion here... Well, she wants,

37:40.625 --> 37:42.329
you know, the whole world to love her.

37:42.329 --> 37:45.461
And tonight, thanks to you,
she's gonna feel the love.

37:45.461 --> 37:48.255
That's why she kept you out of jail.

37:48.505 --> 37:50.427
But after tonight, she's done with you.

37:50.427 --> 37:52.344
Wha... What are you talking about?

37:52.344 --> 37:54.434
You have your bail hearing tomorrow.

37:54.434 --> 37:57.515
Well, your lawyer...
the one Marion hired for you

37:57.515 --> 38:00.266
he should've filed papers
in support of that bail,

38:00.266 --> 38:03.606
but he hasn't done any of those things.

38:03.606 --> 38:05.269
He knows what he's doing.

38:05.269 --> 38:07.194
He's going to jail tomorrow.

38:07.194 --> 38:11.202
Harvey... another casualty
of little Marion's ambition.

38:11.202 --> 38:13.907
Harvey, we'll talk about this later.
Now stop listening to them.

38:13.907 --> 38:16.492
After the show tonight,
that's when you'll talk.

38:16.492 --> 38:19.915
You don't wanna spoil her big night.

38:19.915 --> 38:22.371
I mean, she's worked so hard for it.

38:22.956 --> 38:25.880
Isn't that right, Mr. Bradley?

38:25.880 --> 38:28.505
Keep me out of this.

38:28.837 --> 38:31.340
Her talent...

38:31.675 --> 38:35.185
That's not why you took her on as a student.

38:35.185 --> 38:39.389
Harvey has a connection with the Lincoln
Center Awards Nominating Committee.

38:39.389 --> 38:42.729
Have you heard anything from
them yet, Mr. Bradley?

38:43.059 --> 38:44.772
He's been promised an award.

38:44.772 --> 38:47.857
A Purple Heart for being
your acting coach.

38:47.857 --> 38:53.404
But, you know, none of this should
matter to your audience tonight.

38:53.404 --> 38:54.987
By the way, have you seen the guest list?

38:54.987 --> 38:58.911
It's at my office. / We asked the
theater manager for a copy.

38:58.911 --> 39:02.410
- H-He doesn't have the final list.
- There are nearly 200 people here.

39:02.410 --> 39:04.663
A full house.
Do you know any of them?

39:04.663 --> 39:07.545
They're all behind-the-scenes
people, agents.

39:07.545 --> 39:09.880
- She wouldn't recognize any of them.
- Well, we looked them up.

39:09.880 --> 39:16.556
Um, well, there's this guy here.
He represents child actors.

39:16.556 --> 39:19.432
He was so disappointed when
we told him that you were,

39:19.432 --> 39:20.848
you know, all grown up.

39:20.848 --> 39:22.493
And that one...

39:22.493 --> 39:26.815
He books talent
for cruises up the Hudson River.

39:28.899 --> 39:33.068
Now the rest... Well, for example,
there's this page.

39:33.068 --> 39:38.033
Uh, these are all people from
your mother's senior center.

39:38.033 --> 39:40.867
Right? He's busing them in.

39:40.867 --> 39:44.872
And the next page... Those are
Nick Weaver's buddies and their wives.

39:44.872 --> 39:47.456
They're mostly in the food and
beverage business. / Stop it! Stop it!

39:47.456 --> 39:51.453
You gave Harvey all this money,
and this is the pay off.

39:51.630 --> 39:54.882
You cheat. You fraud.
You charlatan.

39:54.882 --> 39:57.054
It's not the final list, Marion.

39:57.054 --> 39:58.515
There are people from London coming.

39:58.515 --> 40:01.974
All my work.
All those years.

40:01.974 --> 40:06.228
All this... for those nobodies?

40:06.228 --> 40:08.145
No.

40:08.645 --> 40:12.732
He took your money, your husband.

40:14.069 --> 40:16.780
Yeah, yeah, he did.

40:16.780 --> 40:18.079
No. No.

40:18.079 --> 40:22.074
That morning, I saw him
in the pantry next to the tanks.

40:22.074 --> 40:25.244
- No, Marion. Please.
- And when I told him

40:25.244 --> 40:27.959
that James was taking a nap,

40:27.959 --> 40:31.467
he said to let him sleep.

40:36.548 --> 40:42.641
Well, l... I didn't tell anyone
'cause I couldn't believe it, but...

40:42.641 --> 40:44.847
now it's clear.

40:47.644 --> 40:50.563
So, you're... you're both even.

40:50.563 --> 40:56.403
He killed your husband,
and she helped kill your mother.

40:59.819 --> 41:02.868
Your mother was gonna put a wrench
into Marion's big night,

41:02.868 --> 41:07.037
so she got together with her new pal,
Nick Weaver.

41:07.037 --> 41:08.914
That's an absurd lie.

41:08.914 --> 41:12.378
Ask her how she got those
last-minute tickets to Radio City.

41:12.378 --> 41:14.963
- Come on, ask her!
- They were rush tickets!

41:14.963 --> 41:17.258
I think what she means is
a messenger service

41:17.258 --> 41:22.254
rushed them from the agent's office
to Nick Weaver's.

41:23.847 --> 41:27.685
We even have the receipt. / And then
Nick Weaver rushed them to Marion.

41:27.685 --> 41:30.810
And then Marion rushed to call you
to get you out of the house

41:30.810 --> 41:34.815
so one of Nick Weaver's pals could..

41:34.815 --> 41:37.486
kill your mother.

41:38.111 --> 41:40.697
You... You helped him.

41:42.407 --> 41:45.035
You... You helped.

41:45.035 --> 41:46.579
You begged me to go with you.

41:46.579 --> 41:48.787
You wouldn't let me call
my mother after the show.

41:48.787 --> 41:51.085
- Harvey. Harvey.
- You begged me to go with you.

41:51.085 --> 41:55.796
You-You-You wouldn't let me
call my mother.

41:55.796 --> 41:58.757
She made me help her with
her lines all night long

41:58.757 --> 42:01.633
while my mother was being murdered.

42:02.555 --> 42:04.008
Mrs. Whitney.

42:04.720 --> 42:06.847
Don't touch me.

42:10.058 --> 42:13.520
I haven't done anything.
It was Nick Weaver.

42:13.520 --> 42:16.232
He threatened me.

42:16.232 --> 42:19.651
I had no idea what he had in mind.

42:19.651 --> 42:21.694
Well, I was gonna just ask you
to step aside,

42:21.694 --> 42:24.324
but now I'm gonna have to
put you under arrest.

42:24.324 --> 42:26.310
You can't do this to me.

42:26.310 --> 42:28.429
This can't be happening to me.

42:28.429 --> 42:31.998
Sorry. Looks like you forgot
your ruby slippers.

42:33.124 --> 42:34.788
Let's go, ma'am.

42:37.376 --> 42:39.757
You too, Harvey. / No.

42:39.757 --> 42:42.801
- You're under arrest.
- Please, no.

42:42.801 --> 42:45.552
Oh, God. Oh, God.

42:48.436 --> 42:51.642
And they thought they were
the answer to each other's prayers.

42:51.642 --> 42:53.102
Well, they were.

42:53.102 --> 42:57.027
I mean, she's gonna have another shot
at fame at her trial.

42:57.027 --> 42:59.650
And Harvey...

42:59.650 --> 43:02.235
I think Harvey will like jail.

43:02.235 --> 43:05.530
Well, it's where all the famous people
are these days.
