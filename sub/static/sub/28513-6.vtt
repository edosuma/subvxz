01:51.552 --> 01:55.554
Muero pero mi alma no muere

01:55.598 --> 01:58.765
los amare y los bendeciré
en el cielo

01:58.809 --> 02:00.892
como lo hice en la tierra.

03:37.282 --> 03:39.241
Thank you
for bringing me here.

03:44.206 --> 03:45.622
So what is it?

03:47.501 --> 03:49.292
What did you want
to say to me?

03:52.673 --> 03:54.673
We... We don't have
to do it here.

04:02.474 --> 04:04.641
Working with Standard Oil
is a bad idea.

04:04.685 --> 04:06.601
You can't win.

04:06.645 --> 04:09.312
You think I'm afraid of what
your father will do to me?

04:09.356 --> 04:11.292
No, but whether you're afraid
or not ain't gonna stop him

04:11.316 --> 04:12.733
from doing
what he's gonna do.

04:12.776 --> 04:14.526
I'm trying to figure a way
through this.

04:14.570 --> 04:16.153
A way
that keeps you safe.

04:17.906 --> 04:19.197
Like what?

04:19.241 --> 04:20.531
Wait.

04:20.576 --> 04:22.117
Wait for what?

04:22.161 --> 04:24.244
Me.
You.

04:24.288 --> 04:26.246
The old man
can't live forever.

04:26.290 --> 04:28.874
Maria, he... he... he's putting
me in control of the business.

04:28.917 --> 04:31.293
And I'll provide for you now,
as much as I can,

04:31.336 --> 04:34.838
and when I'm finally in charge,
all this will be yours.

04:34.882 --> 04:38.759
I'm sure your brother would have
something to say about that.

04:40.804 --> 04:43.388
And your wife.

04:43.432 --> 04:48.101
Oh, she'd love the idea
of me being your kept woman.

04:48.145 --> 04:49.853
It wouldn't be
like that.

04:56.487 --> 04:59.029
It's not about the land.

05:01.533 --> 05:03.867
It's not even about
the money.

05:03.911 --> 05:06.536
Your father offered me
plenty of that.

05:06.580 --> 05:10.665
What I want
is my father back.

05:10.709 --> 05:14.127
I want my mother,
my brother, and my sister.

05:14.171 --> 05:16.046
I want
my little nephew back.

05:16.089 --> 05:19.382
I want those holes to be filled
with nothing but dirt.

05:20.385 --> 05:22.344
I can't give you that.
I know.

05:24.640 --> 05:28.141
That's why you're gonna testify
in my case.

05:28.185 --> 05:30.560
About how your father
bribed a judge,

05:30.604 --> 05:32.646
how he plotted the murder
of my family.

05:32.689 --> 05:36.066
You're gonna tell the world
what is true, Peter.

05:36.109 --> 05:38.860
You're gonna help me
clear my father's name.

05:38.904 --> 05:41.279
That's what you owe me.

05:41.323 --> 05:43.323
And that's what I want.

05:43.367 --> 05:45.492
Will you just wait?

05:49.122 --> 05:52.040
It's hard enough
asking for your help.

05:54.253 --> 05:56.336
Don't make it harder.

06:06.682 --> 06:09.349
I should take you
back to town now.

06:55.188 --> 06:57.314
Thank you.

06:57.357 --> 06:59.566
How you doing?

06:59.610 --> 07:01.359
Good to see you.

07:01.403 --> 07:02.819
Howdy.

07:08.619 --> 07:09.826
Evening.

07:09.870 --> 07:11.202
Take care, now.

07:18.420 --> 07:20.003
Happy birthday.

07:23.884 --> 07:25.467
Mm.

07:28.221 --> 07:29.407
Thought about you
at work today.

07:29.431 --> 07:30.680
Oh, yeah?

07:30.724 --> 07:33.516
Yessir,
every meeting I had.

07:33.560 --> 07:36.227
Which meetings?
Who'd you meet with?

07:36.271 --> 07:38.939
No idea.

07:40.901 --> 07:43.568
Hm.

07:43.612 --> 07:45.862
What you thinking about?

07:45.906 --> 07:47.155
Your daddy.

07:48.742 --> 07:51.242
Please don't.

07:52.496 --> 07:54.245
The other day,
when I ran into him,

07:54.289 --> 07:56.456
he didn't seem
all that surprised.

07:56.500 --> 07:59.209
He seemed...
Amused?

07:59.252 --> 08:00.543
Yeah.
Yeah.

08:00.587 --> 08:01.795
That's cuz he knows.

08:01.838 --> 08:03.546
What?

08:03.590 --> 08:04.923
No.

08:04.967 --> 08:07.884
No!
Yep.

08:07.928 --> 08:11.805
Yeah, I must've
been about...

08:11.848 --> 08:13.640
13.

08:13.684 --> 08:15.475
Hard times.

08:15.519 --> 08:18.687
They were all still reeling
from Momma and Everett's deaths.

08:20.774 --> 08:24.943
One night, I met up
with this rancher boy

08:24.987 --> 08:27.737
and snuck back
into the house.

08:27.781 --> 08:29.781
Daddy was there
waiting for me,

08:29.825 --> 08:32.241
and I thought he was gonna
give me a whuppin'.

08:32.284 --> 08:35.745
But, instead,
he poured me a whiskey

08:35.789 --> 08:40.125
and said,
"Be more careful.

08:40.168 --> 08:43.253
I cannot lose
another son."

08:43.296 --> 08:46.840
I guess being raised Comanche
broadens the mind.

08:49.553 --> 08:51.011
Yeah,
for the longest time,

08:51.054 --> 08:55.098
I... I felt this enormous
gratitude to him,

08:55.142 --> 08:56.808
you know,
for letting me be.

08:58.854 --> 09:01.187
But then Pete got married
and had kids

09:01.231 --> 09:03.815
and I saw how he was
with 'em.

09:03.859 --> 09:07.110
He wasn't keeping quiet
just out of love for me.

09:07.154 --> 09:09.112
He'd put me in a drawer

09:09.156 --> 09:11.406
'cause I couldn't contribute
to his legacy.

09:15.912 --> 09:18.288
Did you
even want children?

09:18.331 --> 09:19.956
'Course.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.333
What sort of man
doesn't want a son?

09:22.377 --> 09:24.461
You still could.

09:24.504 --> 09:26.546
Plenty of married men
with our ways.

09:26.590 --> 09:28.048
Nah.

09:28.091 --> 09:30.300
No, I see what Sally
goes through.

09:30.343 --> 09:31.801
Pete doesn't love her.

09:31.845 --> 09:33.678
She holds up the marriage
on her own.

09:35.098 --> 09:38.224
I could never do that
to another woman.

09:38.268 --> 09:39.868
Can we have some more booze
or something?

09:39.895 --> 09:42.479
I thought this was supposed
to be a celebration.

09:53.867 --> 09:56.493
Don't move.

09:59.581 --> 10:00.914
Right over here.

10:04.044 --> 10:05.877
Hold on a minute.
Hold on a minute.

10:10.592 --> 10:12.008
All right, go ahead.

10:17.057 --> 10:18.890
Good.

10:18.934 --> 10:20.391
Wait outside.

10:26.608 --> 10:28.691
You can cover up now.

10:33.281 --> 10:36.199
Mr. McCullough.

10:36.243 --> 10:40.954
Despite what the current
situation indicates,

10:40.997 --> 10:43.081
I do believe
you're a man of substance.

10:43.125 --> 10:44.707
What do you want?

10:46.294 --> 10:48.711
What I want's for you
to come and work for me.

10:51.258 --> 10:52.757
How's that?

10:52.801 --> 10:55.760
Well, you have the ear
of some very powerful men,

10:55.804 --> 10:57.637
about to start
a fantastic position

10:57.681 --> 10:59.055
at this
Railroad Commission,

10:59.099 --> 11:01.766
and, of course,
most importantly,

11:01.810 --> 11:04.102
you can corroborate
Maria García's claims

11:04.146 --> 11:06.229
in our lawsuit.

11:06.273 --> 11:08.314
You want me
to betray my father.

11:12.696 --> 11:14.571
What I have here...

11:14.614 --> 11:16.447
it's an employment agreement.

11:16.491 --> 11:18.658
You sign that

11:18.702 --> 11:21.077
and that photograph
goes away,

11:21.121 --> 11:22.745
and so do these
two police officers.

11:22.789 --> 11:24.247
Do it.

11:24.291 --> 11:26.374
What?
Sign it.

11:28.461 --> 11:30.253
This is how you break away
from your father.

11:30.297 --> 11:32.714
It's everything
you've been hoping for.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.259
Now, there's a man
with a head on his shoulders,

11:36.303 --> 11:37.760
and you ought
to listen to him.

12:01.661 --> 12:03.286
All right, then.

12:03.330 --> 12:05.788
Take them out
through the lobby.

12:09.002 --> 12:10.501
Hands off me.

12:10.545 --> 12:11.794
Put your hands
behind your back.

12:11.838 --> 12:13.213
Put your wrists together.

12:15.175 --> 12:18.009
You sure about this?

12:18.053 --> 12:21.012
Got a full house
down there tonight.

12:21.056 --> 12:22.972
Folks from
the legislature,

12:23.016 --> 12:26.684
the Capitol, the bar.

12:26.728 --> 12:29.687
And a reporter from
"The Statesman" for spice.

12:35.195 --> 12:37.237
Okay.

13:28.790 --> 13:31.874
Colonel, I appreciate you
having us over.

13:31.918 --> 13:34.544
Though we're a bit late
in the season for quail.

13:34.587 --> 13:37.130
Nah, it's gonna be a great day
for a shoot.

13:37.173 --> 13:38.548
I'll say.

13:38.591 --> 13:41.217
Charles, have Clarence here
come over

13:41.261 --> 13:43.928
and get some
of those little pancakes.

13:43.972 --> 13:46.139
- They're my momma's specialty.
- So I hear.

13:47.934 --> 13:50.560
You've been a good
and loyal friend to this family

13:50.603 --> 13:53.896
and the Colonel wanted you
to hear that directly from us.

13:53.940 --> 13:56.733
See, my Uncle Phineas is set to take
a seat on the Railroad Commission.

13:56.776 --> 13:59.652
They're gonna control oil
distribution for all of Texas.

13:59.696 --> 14:01.571
- That so?
- Uh-huh.

14:01.614 --> 14:03.926
I never heard of 'em. Well,
you're about to, make no mistake.

14:03.950 --> 14:06.095
They're gonna be in charge of how
everyone moves oil around the state.

14:06.119 --> 14:07.910
Set prices,
control production...

14:07.954 --> 14:09.807
Needless to say, Standard's
gonna be pretty crippled

14:09.831 --> 14:11.600
without a way to move
their product to market.

14:11.624 --> 14:13.583
Well, this is a godsend.

14:13.626 --> 14:15.918
We've been on tenterhooks
since the injunction.

14:15.962 --> 14:17.587
I'm sure
you understand.

14:17.630 --> 14:19.150
The announcement's
gonna be coming soon,

14:19.174 --> 14:21.966
then we can all breathe
a sigh of relief.

14:29.476 --> 14:31.017
Good morning, Colonel.

14:32.562 --> 14:34.771
Niles.

14:34.814 --> 14:37.482
You're not welcome
in this house.

14:37.525 --> 14:39.317
I come in peace.

14:39.361 --> 14:43.112
At a time like this,
neighbors should pitch in.

14:43.156 --> 14:45.782
I'm here
to offer condolences.

14:45.825 --> 14:49.285
Condolences for what?

14:51.373 --> 14:53.414
You have not heard.

14:55.502 --> 14:57.502
Oh, Lord.

14:57.545 --> 15:01.089
I have put my foot in it,
haven't I?

15:03.885 --> 15:08.388
Your son Phineas was arrested
on a sodomy charge

15:08.431 --> 15:11.057
last night in Austin.

15:11.101 --> 15:15.728
A deviant is a scourge
on any family.

15:15.772 --> 15:18.398
As I understand it,
Phineas is currently

15:18.441 --> 15:20.817
being scrubbed
from the public rolls

15:20.860 --> 15:24.112
and drummed out
of government.

15:25.573 --> 15:27.740
So, I imagine that
Railroad Commission spot...

15:27.784 --> 15:29.283
One more word.

15:31.037 --> 15:32.995
Come on, Niles.
Just one.

16:07.782 --> 16:10.450
Sorry again you had to spend
the night in lock up.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.870
I couldn't get
a straight answer

16:13.913 --> 16:16.164
for why you were denied
a phone call.

16:16.207 --> 16:19.500
Doesn't matter.

16:21.921 --> 16:24.380
I'll be back later
with an advisor

16:24.424 --> 16:27.967
who, uh,
knows how to...

16:28.011 --> 16:30.261
well, let me just say

16:30.305 --> 16:32.638
she's a master
of the better social sets.

16:32.682 --> 16:35.391
She re-introduced
Senator Perkins to good society

16:35.435 --> 16:38.144
when he was caught fiddlin'
with those little girls.

16:38.188 --> 16:40.646
I am not
a child molester.

16:41.649 --> 16:42.690
No.

16:44.194 --> 16:45.610
'Course not.

16:47.864 --> 16:50.281
Anyway...

16:50.325 --> 16:51.991
you try to get some rest,

16:52.035 --> 16:54.911
and, uh,
I'll see you later.

16:54.954 --> 16:56.412
Don't forget this.

17:43.711 --> 17:46.879
- I thought he was a bachelor.
- Didn't want to settle down.

17:46.923 --> 17:49.507
I don't know. We never
talked about it, but hell.

17:49.551 --> 17:53.302
Of course you knew.
We all did.

17:53.346 --> 17:55.221
Since when?

17:55.265 --> 17:57.014
Since forever.

17:57.058 --> 17:58.641
You never said anything.

17:58.685 --> 18:01.018
He's your brother.

18:01.062 --> 18:03.271
Do I have to pack
a fancy dress?

18:03.314 --> 18:05.731
No, we're not
going to celebrate.

18:05.775 --> 18:07.525
But tell your brothers
to hurry up.

18:07.569 --> 18:09.652
I want us to be on the road
in 15 minutes.

18:09.696 --> 18:11.070
Yes, ma'am.

18:14.075 --> 18:17.034
I'm surprised
this doesn't bother you.

18:17.078 --> 18:19.495
I mean, it's a sin.

18:25.503 --> 18:28.087
Well, maybe you don't know me
as well as you think you do.

18:31.509 --> 18:32.967
Why doesn't it?

18:37.515 --> 18:39.974
I know it should.

18:41.436 --> 18:45.771
And I go to church,
and I read my Bible.

18:48.318 --> 18:50.651
I just can't help
the way I feel.

18:53.031 --> 18:55.364
Finn is my rock,
and...

18:58.369 --> 19:00.786
I don't know.
I just love him.

19:15.595 --> 19:17.053
Sal?

19:32.779 --> 19:34.862
I'm sorry.

19:34.906 --> 19:37.615
I really am.

19:37.659 --> 19:39.158
For what?

19:39.202 --> 19:41.452
For everything.

19:41.496 --> 19:44.497
I shoulda
said it sooner.

19:44.540 --> 19:46.582
You deserve better.

19:52.465 --> 19:55.883
You're damn right
I do.

20:04.102 --> 20:06.185
Go get packing.

20:06.229 --> 20:07.937
He needs us.

20:17.990 --> 20:19.407
Finn?

20:39.345 --> 20:42.054
I'm so glad you're here.

20:56.571 --> 20:59.280
We're gonna
get through it together.

20:59.323 --> 21:00.740
Okay.
I swear.

21:08.499 --> 21:11.333
Thankfully, the prosecutor
is an admirer of the Colonel's,

21:11.377 --> 21:13.711
so we've come
to an understanding.

21:13.755 --> 21:16.255
How much did that understanding
cost us?

21:18.634 --> 21:22.470
The charges will be dropped.
That's all that matters.

21:22.513 --> 21:24.180
What about the press?

21:24.223 --> 21:26.474
We can't stop the stories
from running in the papers,

21:26.517 --> 21:28.851
but we can discredit them
after they do.

21:28.895 --> 21:30.603
How?

21:30.646 --> 21:32.855
You're being framed
by Yankees

21:32.899 --> 21:35.733
because you stood in the way
of their oil monopoly.

21:35.777 --> 21:37.526
Standard Oil
paid a male prostitute

21:37.570 --> 21:41.030
to break into your room
and strip down to his skivvies.

21:41.073 --> 21:42.990
The man was a deviant,

21:43.034 --> 21:45.576
and you helped the police
set a trap to catch him.

21:45.620 --> 21:46.994
Yeah,
I'm not saying that.

21:47.038 --> 21:49.413
You don't get
to dictate terms.

21:51.542 --> 21:53.667
I'm sorry, son.

21:53.711 --> 21:55.795
You gave up that right
when you dragged the family

21:55.838 --> 21:57.880
into your personal life.

21:59.967 --> 22:03.010
Olivia, this is, uh,
as good a time as any

22:03.054 --> 22:05.137
to break out
the photographs.

22:05.181 --> 22:07.056
Of course,
Colonel.

22:07.099 --> 22:09.767
Phineas, as I explained
to your father,

22:09.811 --> 22:11.580
an important part of
your public rehabilitation

22:11.604 --> 22:13.062
is for you
to live your life

22:13.105 --> 22:14.355
in a manner
that argues against

22:14.398 --> 22:16.732
the fabric
of these allegations.

22:16.776 --> 22:18.984
We'll get you active
in the local church,

22:19.028 --> 22:21.779
we'll put you on the boards
of several notable charities,

22:21.823 --> 22:24.824
and your wedding will be
a significant social event.

22:24.867 --> 22:26.575
- My wedding.
- Yes.

22:26.619 --> 22:30.079
I've selected some excellent
candidates for you.

22:30.122 --> 22:32.248
Miss Cornish is a widow

22:32.291 --> 22:34.542
and can't have children,
so you wouldn't be obligated

22:34.585 --> 22:37.795
to perform the duties
of a husband.

22:37.839 --> 22:41.215
Miss Kiley certainly
has the looks.

22:41.259 --> 22:43.467
Wouldn't this face
look good on your mantel?

22:43.511 --> 22:45.803
But you should know she's
been in and out of hospitals

22:45.847 --> 22:47.263
for the last few years.

22:47.306 --> 22:50.558
Her father's anxious
for her to meet a stable man.

22:50.601 --> 22:53.727
And Miss Langford here
is a very interesting option.

22:53.771 --> 22:55.437
Bright and articulate...
- Stop.

22:56.440 --> 22:58.566
Just stop.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.613
If I do this,

23:04.657 --> 23:07.157
if I get married,

23:07.201 --> 23:08.742
do I still have a shot

23:08.786 --> 23:10.870
at salvaging
the Railroad Commission?

23:16.961 --> 23:19.044
You best
let go of that.

23:21.591 --> 23:23.507
They've pulled you
from consideration

23:23.551 --> 23:26.343
and will deny
you were on any list.

23:38.941 --> 23:40.816
So...

23:40.860 --> 23:43.027
Uncle Phineas
has sex with men?

23:45.114 --> 23:48.407
I-I mean, how is
that even possible?

23:48.451 --> 23:50.242
You want me to draw you
a picture?

23:52.371 --> 23:54.788
Come on,
I-it's disgusting.

23:54.832 --> 23:56.665
I'm not the only one
who thinks that, right?

23:56.709 --> 23:59.293
You sound
like a sheep, Jonas.

23:59.337 --> 24:02.046
You were talking just
like they want us talking.

24:02.089 --> 24:03.797
Who?
Our enemies.

24:03.841 --> 24:05.674
They are trying to turn us
against each other.

24:05.718 --> 24:07.968
You fell for it.

24:08.012 --> 24:09.470
Baaah.

24:09.513 --> 24:11.597
Stop it.
I'm not a sheep.

24:11.641 --> 24:12.765
Baaah.

24:16.270 --> 24:17.895
I'm just trying
to figure out

24:17.939 --> 24:19.563
how I'm supposed
to act around him.

24:21.817 --> 24:24.318
It's Uncle Phineas.

24:24.362 --> 24:26.528
Just act normal.

24:26.572 --> 24:29.531
He's not some different person
all of a sudden.

24:29.575 --> 24:32.368
He was a different person
the whole time.

25:27.383 --> 25:29.967
Don't creep around
like that.

25:31.554 --> 25:33.387
What can I do for you?

25:33.431 --> 25:35.806
I'm checking to see
if you need anything.

25:35.850 --> 25:37.516
I do not.

25:39.270 --> 25:42.062
How was your trip
to San Francisco?

25:42.106 --> 25:43.439
Terrible.

25:45.443 --> 25:48.277
I'm sorry.

25:48.320 --> 25:50.279
You have my condolences.

25:50.322 --> 25:51.780
For what?

25:51.824 --> 25:55.451
I was talking about
the shitty weather.

25:55.494 --> 25:58.495
I was told that
your son is dying.

25:59.999 --> 26:03.500
Yeah, I bet. You and the hands
sitting around spreading gossip.

26:03.544 --> 26:06.336
The rich old bitch
and her wasted pups.

26:06.380 --> 26:08.422
Nobody meant
any disrespect.

26:08.466 --> 26:10.632
Not about respect.

26:12.595 --> 26:15.387
My boy Tommy
is lying in a hospital

26:15.431 --> 26:17.181
half a country away.

26:17.224 --> 26:19.391
All you know is I'm rich

26:19.435 --> 26:20.934
and he goes around
with boys,

26:20.978 --> 26:23.187
but y-you don't know
how funny he is

26:23.230 --> 26:25.522
and how hard he worked
to please his dad.

26:31.989 --> 26:35.449
W-What's your last name,
anyway?

26:35.493 --> 26:36.784
Sanchez.

26:36.827 --> 26:39.453
Ulises Sanchez.

26:39.497 --> 26:40.662
Hmm.

26:40.706 --> 26:42.956
Bet you any amount

26:43.000 --> 26:47.336
that you have never
promised your child

26:47.379 --> 26:50.047
that he would
grow old and be happy.

26:51.342 --> 26:52.591
No, ma'am.

26:52.635 --> 26:55.135
Don't... Don't
promise 'em nothing.

26:55.179 --> 26:57.179
It might turn out
you're lying.

26:57.223 --> 26:59.765
I'm happy
that you love your son.

27:01.352 --> 27:03.977
You... You're surprised
or something?

27:04.021 --> 27:07.106
Some mothers wouldn't.

27:07.149 --> 27:10.734
Tommy being
the way that he is.

27:12.071 --> 27:16.323
Who you love is nobody else's
damn business.

27:16.367 --> 27:18.367
My Uncle Phineas
was a homo, too.

27:18.410 --> 27:20.244
Best man I ever knew.

27:20.287 --> 27:23.580
Protected me through dark,
dark times.

27:23.624 --> 27:26.959
More of a father to me
than my real one was.

27:27.002 --> 27:29.211
What happened...

27:29.255 --> 27:31.421
to your real father?

27:31.465 --> 27:32.923
Why?

27:32.967 --> 27:34.967
I like to hear
family stories.

27:35.010 --> 27:37.427
I guess I don't know
that many of my own.

27:40.516 --> 27:42.099
His name was...

27:42.143 --> 27:43.642
Pete.

27:45.521 --> 27:47.646
I have no idea
what happened to him.

27:50.025 --> 27:51.608
Anything else?

27:57.032 --> 27:59.992
No, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.

28:32.151 --> 28:34.359
Oye, Ulises.
Ven acá.

28:36.030 --> 28:37.529
¿Sí, patrón?

29:23.577 --> 29:25.994
Hello.

29:26.038 --> 29:28.121
I'm Sally McCullough.

29:28.165 --> 29:30.916
It's an honor
to meet you, ma'am.

29:30.960 --> 29:34.002
I don't think we have
to be so formal, do we?

29:34.046 --> 29:38.006
Formalities are a comfort,
if you don't mind.

29:39.218 --> 29:40.425
Please.

29:45.015 --> 29:47.557
How are you?

29:47.601 --> 29:49.643
Well, I've seen
better days.

29:52.523 --> 29:54.356
Can you get me
out of here?

29:56.652 --> 29:59.319
I wish that I could.

29:59.363 --> 30:02.030
They're gonna
court-martial me.

30:02.074 --> 30:04.449
My sister's the only one
left in my family

30:04.493 --> 30:06.618
who still speaks to me.

30:06.662 --> 30:08.829
I send her half my pay.

30:10.916 --> 30:13.333
She has a little boy.

30:13.377 --> 30:15.419
They won't have money
for rent.

30:15.462 --> 30:17.671
Look, we can help them
with that.

30:17.715 --> 30:20.132
What would really help
is a phone call

30:20.175 --> 30:22.592
from your father-in-law
to my commanding officer.

30:26.140 --> 30:28.348
Come on.

30:28.392 --> 30:32.352
He's the Comanche Gringo,
the First Son of Texas.

30:32.396 --> 30:34.980
If Eli McCullough suddenly
wanted the Colorado River

30:35.024 --> 30:36.648
on the other side
of the state house,

30:36.692 --> 30:38.525
they'd move it for him.

30:38.569 --> 30:41.361
The subject came up,

30:41.405 --> 30:43.739
and he can't be seen
getting involved.

30:45.409 --> 30:47.534
So, what?

30:47.578 --> 30:51.038
This visit is the limit
of his influence?

30:53.167 --> 30:54.875
I wish there was more.

30:57.755 --> 30:59.463
Is that from Phineas?

31:04.720 --> 31:06.803
Yes.

31:06.847 --> 31:08.513
I don't want it.

31:08.557 --> 31:10.807
Throw it away.

31:10.851 --> 31:12.351
I can't.

31:14.021 --> 31:17.189
Nothing in there
changes anything.

31:22.613 --> 31:26.490
I'd never socialized
above my station before.

31:28.410 --> 31:30.994
I won't make
that mistake again.

31:31.038 --> 31:32.913
Oh, no, Phineas d...

31:32.956 --> 31:35.707
God, he didn't
see you like that.

31:35.751 --> 31:38.377
He felt close to you
very quickly.

31:38.420 --> 31:41.213
And for him,
that's rare.

31:41.256 --> 31:43.507
He wishes
he could be with you,

31:43.550 --> 31:44.925
even now.

31:44.968 --> 31:48.261
God, he's heartbroken,
I promise you.

31:50.933 --> 31:53.183
Which prison is he in?

31:58.816 --> 32:02.067
I have a feeling
he'll be fine.

32:13.455 --> 32:17.165
How to choose,
I tell you?

32:17.209 --> 32:20.085
Oh, Diane Culey
was a Parade Princess.

32:20.129 --> 32:21.503
Princess?
Yeah.

32:21.547 --> 32:23.839
At the Hogeye Fair,
two years running.

32:23.882 --> 32:25.298
Consistency is a virtue.

32:27.344 --> 32:30.679
And Miss Carley Hughes
raises chickens

32:30.722 --> 32:33.765
and enjoys the fine art
of decoupage.

32:35.060 --> 32:36.935
Ah, maybe
that's her now.

32:36.979 --> 32:39.020
Don't get married, Finn.
Say no to him.

32:39.064 --> 32:41.815
Ah, but Miss Rainier
is a mezzo-soprano

32:41.859 --> 32:43.900
who adores The Beggar's Opera.

32:43.944 --> 32:47.863
What a treat that
could turn out to...

33:07.843 --> 33:11.928
Ever wonder
if we're cursed somehow?

33:13.474 --> 33:14.806
This family.

33:14.850 --> 33:17.559
I don't believe
in curses.

33:17.603 --> 33:18.852
So what, then?

33:18.896 --> 33:21.438
God testing us?
Punishing us?

33:22.816 --> 33:24.107
God.

33:27.446 --> 33:30.238
He doesn't give
a damn about us.

33:30.282 --> 33:32.032
That's a hell
of a thing to say.

33:35.537 --> 33:39.247
We are not being taken
to task for our sins.

33:40.167 --> 33:42.626
We're playing
the game all wrong.

33:44.421 --> 33:47.172
Our opponents are coming
at us bare knuckles

33:47.216 --> 33:50.050
and we aren't willing
to take off our gloves.

33:50.093 --> 33:52.010
Right, Daddy?

34:05.442 --> 34:07.567
What's that
supposed to mean?

34:10.112 --> 34:12.030
I'm damned if I know.

34:19.414 --> 34:20.746
Excuse me a moment.

34:33.469 --> 34:35.011
What the hell
are you thinking

34:35.054 --> 34:36.972
bringing that shit up
in front of your brother?

34:37.014 --> 34:38.764
I told you.
Huh?

34:38.809 --> 34:40.225
I told you
she had to go.

34:40.268 --> 34:43.228
I begged you
to listen to me.

34:43.272 --> 34:44.980
If she had
quietly disappeared,

34:45.023 --> 34:47.607
we would have stopped the
injunction, stopped the lawsuit.

34:47.650 --> 34:49.067
I'd be on
the Railroad Commission,

34:49.110 --> 34:50.777
and we'd have
our goddamn monopoly.

34:50.821 --> 34:53.487
But you didn't have the stomach
because when it comes to Pete,

34:53.532 --> 34:55.364
you have a blind spot.

34:55.409 --> 34:58.326
And now look where we are.
Look where I am!

34:58.370 --> 35:00.161
Son, I know
this is hard for you,

35:00.205 --> 35:01.621
but I'm not to blame.

35:03.417 --> 35:05.000
You know, I...

35:05.043 --> 35:08.211
Last summer when it came time
to move against the Garcías,

35:08.255 --> 35:09.379
you got cold feet.

35:09.423 --> 35:11.131
If I hadn't taken action,

35:11.174 --> 35:12.757
we'd have lost everything.

35:12.801 --> 35:15.176
Deny it, go ahead.

35:17.264 --> 35:19.055
I told you
it was a mistake

35:19.099 --> 35:21.850
to bring Pete home
after he sold us out,

35:21.893 --> 35:23.727
but you insisted.

35:23.770 --> 35:25.812
Y-You polished him up,
you put him in charge,

35:25.856 --> 35:27.230
and what's the first thing
he did?

35:27.274 --> 35:28.940
He forced you
to fire Niles Gilbert

35:28.984 --> 35:31.067
and turn him against us.

35:31.111 --> 35:32.986
And when Maria García
came at us,

35:33.030 --> 35:34.362
the right thing to do

35:34.406 --> 35:36.531
was to put a bullet
between her eyes.

35:36.575 --> 35:38.908
But we didn't.
Why not?

35:38.952 --> 35:41.369
You were scared
of losing Pete.

35:43.790 --> 35:47.000
It makes me sick
how weak you are.

35:47.044 --> 35:48.960
Comanche, my ass.

35:59.348 --> 36:00.972
Everything okay?
Daddy?

36:03.226 --> 36:06.019
Hey, where you going?

36:06.063 --> 36:07.395
Daddy!

36:16.572 --> 36:18.531
Some people use
two feathers.

36:18.575 --> 36:20.992
Flies better
with three.

36:21.036 --> 36:23.495
Fat Wolf said
to use two.

36:23.538 --> 36:25.121
We use three.

36:27.876 --> 36:30.627
There's Scalped-A-Dog's widow,
praying again.

36:30.671 --> 36:32.295
She comes down here
every day.

36:34.633 --> 36:36.466
I've seen her.

36:36.510 --> 36:39.094
She's wasting her time.

36:39.137 --> 36:41.346
What?

36:41.390 --> 36:43.682
Prayers won't bring
her husband back.

36:45.102 --> 36:47.018
She doesn't know that.

36:47.062 --> 36:49.270
It's been two weeks,
Eli.

36:49.314 --> 36:52.232
She should understand
he's dead by now.

36:52.275 --> 36:54.526
Get on with her life.

36:54.569 --> 36:56.528
Anything else is stupid.

36:56.571 --> 36:59.614
You...
You have a cold heart.

36:59.658 --> 37:01.825
Don't say things
like that, Eli.

37:01.868 --> 37:03.284
It hurts me.
Does it?

37:03.328 --> 37:05.328
Does it hurt you?

37:05.372 --> 37:07.497
You killed
that woman's husband.

37:07.541 --> 37:09.040
Are you sorry?

37:10.168 --> 37:12.043
He deserved it.

37:12.087 --> 37:14.713
That's not what I asked,
and you know it.

37:14.756 --> 37:16.923
Are you sorry?

37:20.804 --> 37:24.472
When I was a little girl,
my grossmutter told me a story.

37:24.516 --> 37:26.683
It was about a soldier
who could no longer fight

37:26.727 --> 37:28.852
because he had been wounded
in battle.

37:28.895 --> 37:31.521
What does that have to
do with anything? Shh.

37:31.565 --> 37:35.692
The soldier had no home,
no purpose left.

37:35.736 --> 37:37.485
One day, not knowing
where to go,

37:37.529 --> 37:41.448
he was walking through the woods
when he came across a witch.

37:41.491 --> 37:43.742
She offered him
food and shelter

37:43.785 --> 37:46.536
if he agreed to do
her chores for her.

37:46.580 --> 37:49.914
Gardening,
chopping wood.

37:49.958 --> 37:53.001
She also asked him to retrieve
a beautiful blue light of hers

37:53.044 --> 37:54.711
that had fallen
down a well.

37:56.089 --> 37:58.715
The soldier
went down to get it.

37:58.759 --> 38:00.967
When he got there,

38:01.011 --> 38:04.637
the blue light warmed his hands
and filled his spirit.

38:04.681 --> 38:07.015
It healed
all of his pain.

38:11.146 --> 38:13.146
When he was climbing back up
with the blue light,

38:13.190 --> 38:16.316
the witch reached down
to get it from him.

38:16.359 --> 38:19.277
He fought her off.

38:19.321 --> 38:21.863
Didn't want to let go
of that blue light.

38:21.907 --> 38:23.323
Is that the end?

38:24.993 --> 38:26.868
The witch
had to kill him.

38:28.413 --> 38:30.914
She took back
what was hers.

38:30.957 --> 38:33.541
And you know what?

38:33.585 --> 38:35.084
She wasn't sorry.

38:37.714 --> 38:39.506
Your grandmother
told you that story?

38:39.549 --> 38:41.049
Yes.

38:42.302 --> 38:43.760
Well, it's horrible.

38:45.055 --> 38:47.514
So is the world, Eli.

38:47.557 --> 38:49.849
A soft heart is weakness.

39:01.530 --> 39:02.946
Okay.

39:43.864 --> 39:45.238
Ingrid.

39:45.282 --> 39:46.614
Ingrid!

39:50.078 --> 39:51.327
Ingrid, open the door.

39:51.371 --> 39:52.996
Are you crazy?

39:53.039 --> 39:55.415
You'll wake my husband
and the whole neighborhood.

39:55.458 --> 39:57.834
- I need to talk.
- No, you can't be here.

40:00.922 --> 40:02.297
I'm lost, Ingrid.

40:02.340 --> 40:05.258
Oh, no, you're drunk
and full of self-pity.

40:05.302 --> 40:08.344
Let's talk tomorrow.
I'll meet you somewhere.

40:08.388 --> 40:10.430
Do you remember
the blue light?

40:10.473 --> 40:13.308
The story you told me.
The soldier and the blue light.

40:13.351 --> 40:14.809
Can you tell it
to me again?

40:14.853 --> 40:17.645
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

40:17.689 --> 40:19.564
You have to leave.

40:19.608 --> 40:21.900
Come on.
We should.

40:21.943 --> 40:23.818
We should.
Should what?

40:23.862 --> 40:25.069
Leave.

40:25.113 --> 40:27.113
You and me.

40:27.157 --> 40:29.490
I have my car.
We can drive to New Mexico.

40:29.534 --> 40:32.076
You can still get big tracts
of land for pennies.

40:32.120 --> 40:33.828
And do what?

40:33.872 --> 40:36.247
And you can paint.

40:36.291 --> 40:38.666
I can hunt deer
and javelinas.

40:38.710 --> 40:39.834
Yeah.

40:41.838 --> 40:43.630
Eli, I'm... I'm married.

40:43.673 --> 40:45.006
Oh, that doesn't matter.

40:45.050 --> 40:48.301
I have a life I've built,
and so do you.

40:48.345 --> 40:49.886
And whatever
you're sad about today,

40:49.930 --> 40:52.221
it will be different tomorrow.
No, that's not true.

40:52.265 --> 40:54.015
That's not true.

40:54.059 --> 40:56.476
We're the only two people
who really know each other.

40:58.271 --> 40:59.646
Help me.

41:03.234 --> 41:06.361
Help me remember
who I was,

41:06.404 --> 41:08.071
and I'll help you.

41:08.114 --> 41:09.864
I don't need help!

41:09.908 --> 41:11.282
Ingrid?

41:11.326 --> 41:13.409
- Oh, I'm begging you. Go.
- Shh, shh, shh.

41:13.453 --> 41:14.911
Ingrid?
Go.

41:17.415 --> 41:20.095
We have let this go on too long. No,
you don't mean that. You don't...

41:20.126 --> 41:21.459
You can't ever
come here again!

41:21.503 --> 41:22.835
No, Ingrid.
You don't mean that.

41:22.879 --> 41:24.504
I can't be the person
you come to

41:24.547 --> 41:26.631
when everything else
falls apart!

41:30.804 --> 41:32.637
It's okay, Tom.

41:32.681 --> 41:34.681
He's leaving.

41:36.309 --> 41:38.017
And he won't be back.

41:42.023 --> 41:44.691
I'm sorry.

41:44.734 --> 41:46.484
I'm so sorry.

42:15.306 --> 42:17.890
Eli!

42:19.102 --> 42:21.936
Ingrid! Ingrid!

42:21.980 --> 42:23.688
Eli.

42:34.242 --> 42:36.659
You changed your mind.
Yes.

42:38.496 --> 42:40.621
Wait. Ingrid.

42:42.459 --> 42:44.584
Wait!

42:44.627 --> 42:46.669
Ingrid, wait! Wait!

42:46.713 --> 42:49.589
Ingrid!

42:49.632 --> 42:52.592
Ingrid, come back!
Wait for me!

42:54.262 --> 42:56.763
Ingrid!

42:56.806 --> 42:58.806
Ingrid!

43:00.643 --> 43:02.351
Ingrid.

43:08.234 --> 43:10.359
Good. You're here.

43:11.321 --> 43:13.529
You can help me
when he comes out.

43:13.573 --> 43:15.073
I can't do that.

43:15.116 --> 43:16.908
God, you're a mess.

43:16.951 --> 43:19.243
I can't do
what Phineas wants.

43:19.287 --> 43:21.954
I can't stomach
any more bloodshed.

43:21.998 --> 43:24.082
So, you're deciding
to surrender?

43:24.125 --> 43:26.793
Just like that?
Not going to fight?

43:26.836 --> 43:28.628
Who are you, Eli?

43:28.671 --> 43:30.046
I'm a father.

43:30.090 --> 43:32.715
You're a warrior, Eli!

43:32.759 --> 43:34.550
Or at least
you used to be.

43:34.594 --> 43:36.238
The young man I loved
would have knocked down

43:36.262 --> 43:39.055
anything in his way
and never looked back.

43:39.099 --> 43:40.765
Come on, Eli.

43:40.809 --> 43:44.268
Take what you want
or it gets taken from you.

43:58.409 --> 44:00.701
That light is yours, Eli.

44:00.745 --> 44:03.454
It will solve all of your problems.
Ingrid...

44:03.498 --> 44:06.624
But if you want it,
you have to take it from him.

44:06.668 --> 44:07.750
No.

44:32.610 --> 44:33.985
Coward.

45:02.640 --> 45:04.599
Oh, man.

45:04.642 --> 45:07.935
Oh, geez.

45:07.979 --> 45:10.104
God.
