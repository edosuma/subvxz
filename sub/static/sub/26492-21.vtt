WEBVTT

00:01.008 --> 00:02.301
Previously, on Riverdale...

00:02.325 --> 00:03.365
He was there to kill me.

00:03.390 --> 00:04.915
That's the real Archie Andrews.

00:04.925 --> 00:07.165
I don't own the diner, my father does.

00:07.235 --> 00:08.245
And La Bonne Nuit, too.

00:08.255 --> 00:09.575
Will you help me, Archie?

00:09.600 --> 00:12.185
And this time, we can take
down my father for good.

00:12.210 --> 00:13.235
Hell, yeah.

00:13.260 --> 00:14.720
I have someone who can help you.

00:14.745 --> 00:16.401
A friend of mine on the Farm.

00:16.426 --> 00:17.812
Groups like the Farm

00:17.837 --> 00:20.529
prey on emotionally vulnerable people.

00:20.585 --> 00:22.805
You're actually buying this Farm crap.

00:22.875 --> 00:26.475
Edgar and I have a deep
understanding of one another.

00:26.485 --> 00:29.395
Everyone in your life
is here in this room.

00:29.405 --> 00:31.500
Join us, and we can unpack

00:31.525 --> 00:34.670
this obsession you have
with the Gargoyle King.

00:34.695 --> 00:36.525
I've seen him, the Gargoyle King.

00:36.550 --> 00:38.536
- He's out there.
- I need your help.

00:38.561 --> 00:41.025
This game is literally killing people.

00:41.097 --> 00:42.726
Penny and I, we thought
it was just a game.

00:42.750 --> 00:44.125
But it's not. It's so much more.

00:44.150 --> 00:46.011
Were you playing Gryphons
and Gargoyles with Dilton?

00:46.035 --> 00:47.251
He was teaching me how to play

00:47.276 --> 00:48.421
so I could eventually join the game.

00:48.445 --> 00:50.047
Ricky said that the gospel's

00:50.072 --> 00:52.159
where the Gargoyle King
keeps all the secrets.

00:52.205 --> 00:54.625
The gospel that we found,
the proclamation...

00:54.705 --> 00:57.085
It was all to get me
alone with my dad again.

00:57.165 --> 00:58.512
The return of the Black Hood.

00:58.536 --> 01:00.426
Now we have two serial
killers running around.

01:00.451 --> 01:01.881
Possibly working together.

01:04.084 --> 01:06.780
It was the deadliest
prom night since Carrie's.

01:08.005 --> 01:10.815
Riverdale High had been
overrun by the Black Hood,

01:10.840 --> 01:12.142
my girlfriend's dad.

01:12.167 --> 01:16.094
And the Gargoyle King, true
identity yet to be determined.

01:16.695 --> 01:18.995
We needed answers starting with...

01:19.065 --> 01:21.275
So how in the hell did Hal
Cooper fake his own death

01:21.300 --> 01:22.920
in a bus explosion?

01:23.055 --> 01:28.075
Well, I re-examined the tell-tale
hand recovered from the bus.

01:28.100 --> 01:29.210
See here?

01:29.235 --> 01:31.625
The erratic incision at
the wrist leads me to think

01:31.650 --> 01:34.750
this amputation was self-inflicted.

01:34.865 --> 01:36.800
So the Black Hood cut off his own hand

01:36.825 --> 01:39.465
and left it behind to
convince everyone he died?

01:39.490 --> 01:41.210
It's not an easy task.

01:41.335 --> 01:43.475
There are eight bones
in the human wrist.

01:46.715 --> 01:49.015
Forget it, Hiram. I will
not endorse or support this.

01:49.025 --> 01:50.820
We have drugs on our streets.

01:50.845 --> 01:52.685
Gangs at every corner.

01:52.695 --> 01:55.315
Riverdale is broken,
about to slide off a cliff,

01:55.385 --> 01:57.315
and the only way to save
it is to privatize it.

01:57.340 --> 01:58.480
And by "privatize," you mean

01:58.505 --> 02:00.750
you want to buy the town of Riverdale?

02:00.775 --> 02:01.955
I'd like to put in a bid

02:01.980 --> 02:04.000
to relieve our town of its debts

02:04.025 --> 02:06.865
and assume its leadership. So, yes.

02:06.875 --> 02:10.495
I plan to buy Riverdale
with or without your support.

02:10.574 --> 02:13.575
And Governor Dooley has already
signed off on the strategy.

02:13.600 --> 02:14.700
So...

02:16.915 --> 02:17.915
My advice?

02:19.295 --> 02:20.345
Clear out your office.

02:22.465 --> 02:25.175
The deed, the contract I signed,

02:25.200 --> 02:26.410
none of it matters.

02:26.435 --> 02:27.525
It was all fake.

02:27.550 --> 02:29.916
My dad still owns
Pop's and the speakeasy

02:29.941 --> 02:32.480
and I'm a fool for ever trusting him.

02:32.715 --> 02:34.685
And on top of everything
he's done to me,

02:34.765 --> 02:37.075
he's now planning on
buying the entire town.

02:37.145 --> 02:38.932
Yeah, Ronnie, your dad sucks.

02:42.324 --> 02:43.459
Wait a minute.

02:44.655 --> 02:47.985
What about all the shady stuff
that goes down at the speakeasy?

02:48.065 --> 02:49.865
If it's my dad's name on the deed,

02:49.945 --> 02:51.745
can't he be prosecuted for it?

02:51.825 --> 02:54.035
Shady stuff as in...

02:54.045 --> 02:55.705
Drinking without carding,

02:55.785 --> 02:58.875
and/or illegal gambling, let's say?

02:58.955 --> 03:00.415
Hiram did these things?

03:00.495 --> 03:02.715
Well, technically no, not exactly.

03:02.785 --> 03:05.555
But if the property were under his name,

03:06.845 --> 03:08.198
doesn't that make him liable?

03:09.715 --> 03:11.875
I think I might know someone
who might be able to help.

03:28.535 --> 03:30.905
Ardelia and I went to
Sara Florence together.

03:30.985 --> 03:32.455
Now she's my friend at the FBI.

03:32.535 --> 03:35.585
The FBI has had their eye on
Hiram Lodge for a long time.

03:35.610 --> 03:37.530
He served less than a
year for embezzlement.

03:37.578 --> 03:39.225
So whatever we can charge
him with in the future,

03:39.249 --> 03:40.679
it's gotta be gang busters.

03:40.825 --> 03:43.103
How about serving alcohol to minors

03:43.128 --> 03:45.295
and operating an illegal casino?

03:45.305 --> 03:46.493
And doctoring books.

03:46.518 --> 03:48.095
Aren't those crimes you committed?

03:48.105 --> 03:51.595
My client can neither confirm
nor deny that statement.

03:51.675 --> 03:55.225
Don't worry, we want
your father, not you.

03:55.305 --> 03:56.611
If none of this stuff will be enough

03:56.635 --> 03:58.225
to get Hiram arrested, then what will?

03:58.305 --> 03:59.975
Catch him red-handed.

04:00.055 --> 04:02.985
We need to arrest Hiram
committing a crime in real time.

04:03.065 --> 04:05.065
Understood, Agent Ardelia.

04:05.090 --> 04:06.150
Let me see what I can do.

04:08.355 --> 04:11.216
Betty, now that you're here,

04:12.355 --> 04:14.795
your mother and sister have
something they'd like to tell you.

04:18.471 --> 04:19.471
Go ahead, Alice.

04:22.845 --> 04:24.795
Honey, when you were eight,

04:24.875 --> 04:28.295
you spent some time in the hospital
after you fell off your bike

04:28.375 --> 04:29.905
and got a concussion.

04:29.915 --> 04:32.813
While you were there, the
doctors ran a bunch of tests

04:32.838 --> 04:35.775
and they discovered...

04:38.505 --> 04:39.655
What?

04:42.515 --> 04:44.355
What, Mom?

04:44.365 --> 04:47.485
They discovered that you have the MAOA

04:47.565 --> 04:49.945
and the CDH13 genes

04:50.025 --> 04:51.615
which are commonly called...

04:51.685 --> 04:53.224
The serial killer genes.

04:53.225 --> 04:55.575
They tested the rest of us
for it, none of us have it,

04:55.655 --> 04:57.205
not even Dad.

04:57.215 --> 04:58.495
It's just you, Betty.

04:58.575 --> 05:00.809
You have a predisposition to violence.

05:06.915 --> 05:09.635
But now that you know you
have it, and you're here,

05:09.705 --> 05:11.345
Edgar can help you heal.

05:14.085 --> 05:15.555
Ho... How?

05:15.565 --> 05:18.145
If... If this is true,

05:19.055 --> 05:20.655
how can you help me?

05:23.595 --> 05:25.155
Let's start by talking.

05:28.195 --> 05:30.695
Just because you were born with a malady

05:30.775 --> 05:32.125
doesn't mean it defines you.

05:34.025 --> 05:35.045
Destiny,

05:38.065 --> 05:39.915
it's a false notion.

05:39.925 --> 05:42.585
You are destined to make a choice.

05:46.223 --> 05:49.055
Give in to your proclivity, or fight it.

05:50.455 --> 05:52.045
Tell me your fears.

05:54.515 --> 05:56.725
Now, begin.

06:02.815 --> 06:05.775
I've always felt like there's
another person inside of me.

06:07.975 --> 06:11.285
A person capable of doing
dark, terrible things,

06:12.975 --> 06:15.085
and I don't know how to get rid of her.

06:17.155 --> 06:20.215
The first step is confrontation.

06:34.145 --> 06:35.475
Hi, Betty.

06:35.965 --> 06:37.065
Hello.

06:38.625 --> 06:39.895
Who are you?

06:40.675 --> 06:41.895
Take a closer look.

06:44.135 --> 06:46.985
We know each other very, very well.

06:51.235 --> 06:52.235
You're...

06:53.475 --> 06:54.475
me.

06:55.275 --> 06:57.575
I'm the shadows,

06:57.645 --> 06:59.915
that you hide from
our family and friends.

07:02.195 --> 07:04.925
I'm all the dark deeds
you did in our youth.

07:06.245 --> 07:08.245
And now,

07:08.325 --> 07:11.425
think of what we did
to our old cat, Caramel.

07:11.505 --> 07:15.925
Caramel ran away. I
didn't do anything to her.

07:16.005 --> 07:17.755
Oh, Betty.

07:17.835 --> 07:20.135
We both know that we drowned Caramel.

07:20.215 --> 07:22.265
Wha...

07:22.345 --> 07:25.145
What about the time we
pushed Polly down the stairs?

07:25.215 --> 07:26.985
Or do you not remember that either?

07:28.325 --> 07:29.825
No, that's...

07:31.865 --> 07:33.365
That's not true.

07:33.445 --> 07:34.985
Oh, but it is.

07:35.065 --> 07:37.155
Here's what else is true.

07:37.235 --> 07:38.955
I am not a part of you.

07:40.455 --> 07:42.915
You are part of me.

07:44.955 --> 07:48.035
I'm the real Elizabeth Cooper.

07:48.055 --> 07:50.385
You are the illusion.

07:53.125 --> 07:54.265
Ah.

08:06.645 --> 08:09.615
The first few sessions, it's
normal to feel disoriented.

08:11.305 --> 08:12.535
What else did you feel?

08:15.245 --> 08:17.535
I had this, um,

08:18.775 --> 08:22.125
uh, stabbing pain in my forehead.

08:23.665 --> 08:25.545
Your body's located your trauma.

08:28.135 --> 08:29.505
That's step one.

08:41.965 --> 08:44.660
Healing is painful, but together,

08:44.685 --> 08:47.395
we can discharge that pain forever.

08:49.635 --> 08:51.235
This is just the beginning.

08:55.746 --> 09:00.746
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly </font>-
- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

09:02.238 --> 09:05.338
I thought the Farm would keep
me safe from the Black Hood.

09:05.463 --> 09:07.393
But, bonus, I'm also learning

09:07.418 --> 09:10.168
a bunch of fun, terrifying
facts about myself.

09:10.248 --> 09:12.048
I had a session with Edgar

09:12.058 --> 09:15.058
and I still can't wrap my
mind around what happened.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.457
Uh, Betty, don't let Edgar

09:17.482 --> 09:20.018
or these Farmies get inside your head.

09:20.028 --> 09:22.823
So he had these magnetic
balls on his desk

09:22.848 --> 09:25.135
that were clicking and clacking...

09:25.160 --> 09:27.238
Maybe he's using sound
to try and influence you.

09:27.318 --> 09:28.918
Do you need me to get you out of there?

09:31.318 --> 09:32.498
No.

09:33.898 --> 09:34.898
No.

09:36.828 --> 09:39.958
I think I have an idea for
my next session with Edgar.

09:42.498 --> 09:44.748
It's time I found out
what the Farm is about,

09:44.758 --> 09:46.138
once and for all.

09:47.408 --> 09:49.054
Yeah. I'm trying to
find out the connection

09:49.078 --> 09:50.838
between the Gargoyle
King and the Black Hood.

09:52.078 --> 09:54.388
Oh, I had a thought about that.

09:54.413 --> 09:56.433
The reason I went off alone during Prom

09:56.458 --> 09:58.393
was because someone dressed as a jester

09:58.418 --> 10:00.678
gave me an envelope
from the Gargoyle King.

10:00.758 --> 10:02.028
Okay, I got my quest.

10:03.298 --> 10:06.608
"Follow the envelope."

10:06.678 --> 10:09.108
Godspeed, my brave Hellcaster.

10:09.118 --> 10:10.408
Bye. Be safe.

10:20.318 --> 10:22.248
Ah.

10:22.318 --> 10:24.998
- It's Louie, right?
- Yeah, and?

10:25.008 --> 10:27.128
Well, this is kind of a funny story.

10:27.138 --> 10:30.248
But a jester gave my
girlfriend an envelope at prom

10:30.328 --> 10:31.378
so I asked around,

10:31.458 --> 10:33.396
Jester's name is Jerry, Jerry told me

10:33.421 --> 10:35.973
that he got the envelope
from a druid named Luna,

10:35.998 --> 10:39.258
Luna said that she got
the envelope from a centaur

10:39.283 --> 10:42.373
named Louie.

10:42.508 --> 10:43.818
True or false?

10:43.898 --> 10:46.028
- Yeah, I gave it to Luna.
- Okay.

10:46.108 --> 10:47.778
So here's the $20 question.

10:48.518 --> 10:50.068
Mmm.

10:50.148 --> 10:51.428
Who'd you get the envelope from?

10:57.578 --> 11:00.252
Some kid gave it to me.
He looked homeless.

11:00.528 --> 11:01.528
A kid?

11:03.528 --> 11:05.288
Was he around 13,

11:05.368 --> 11:06.418
brown hair, brown eyes?

11:08.128 --> 11:09.428
Thank you, Louie.

11:17.338 --> 11:18.348
Can I join you guys?

11:18.529 --> 11:20.159
Hmm, of course, cousin.

11:24.138 --> 11:25.268
Fangs, are you okay?

11:25.278 --> 11:27.938
Yeah, I'm still a little sore

11:28.008 --> 11:29.488
but the big pain is gone now.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.188
What are you taking about?

11:32.198 --> 11:34.608
Fangs had a minor procedure done.

11:34.688 --> 11:36.693
What kind of procedure did you have?

11:37.708 --> 11:43.368
It's a purging of all of the
pain that's been crushing us.

11:43.493 --> 11:45.043
I can't wait for mine to be gone, too.

11:45.068 --> 11:47.048
Hold on, Cheryl,

11:47.128 --> 11:49.363
you're in pain? Like, physical pain?

11:49.418 --> 11:53.668
Well, it's just part of Edgar's methods.

11:53.748 --> 11:57.878
He transforms our emotional
pain into physical pain

11:57.888 --> 12:00.268
so it's easier to treat and banish.

12:00.293 --> 12:01.933
But me first, babe.

12:01.958 --> 12:04.178
That's right, TT's next in line.

12:04.188 --> 12:07.358
For me, the tenderness in my
back only lasted a few days,

12:07.383 --> 12:09.098
but it was so worth it.

12:12.209 --> 12:14.059
Oh, my God, Kevin!

12:14.138 --> 12:16.746
That scar is not from a minor procedure,

12:16.771 --> 12:17.988
that's from major surgery.

12:18.013 --> 12:19.834
Don't ever do that again, Betty.

12:21.078 --> 12:22.078
Kev...

12:29.948 --> 12:31.338
- Ronnie.
- Archie.

12:32.548 --> 12:34.598
I have a plan to catch my father.

12:34.668 --> 12:36.314
To put him back behind
bars where he belongs

12:36.338 --> 12:38.338
and stop him from buying our town.

12:38.363 --> 12:39.496
Okay, what is it?

12:39.521 --> 12:42.248
It's gonna require that we
each play our parts flawlessly.

12:42.958 --> 12:45.008
And you're up first.

12:45.088 --> 12:47.218
Big changes coming to Riverdale.

12:47.238 --> 12:48.928
Opportunities.

12:48.948 --> 12:52.688
Riverfront, Northside.

12:52.768 --> 12:54.908
I'm going to need some
strong allies I can trust.

12:56.638 --> 12:58.948
Archie Andrews. What a surprise.

12:59.028 --> 13:01.158
I heard you're trying to
buy Riverdale, Mr. Lodge,

13:01.608 --> 13:02.608
my town.

13:03.198 --> 13:04.488
I can't let that happen.

13:04.568 --> 13:06.448
It's all right, Archie.

13:06.458 --> 13:08.138
It's a good thing for
everyone. You'll see.

13:08.208 --> 13:11.368
I am sick of you thinking
you can control everyone,

13:11.448 --> 13:12.628
take over everything.

13:12.638 --> 13:14.208
You think you're unstoppable,

13:14.288 --> 13:15.798
which is why I wanna kick your ass.

13:18.328 --> 13:21.758
If I win, you walk away from Riverdale.

13:21.838 --> 13:24.758
If you win, the town's yours.

13:24.838 --> 13:27.858
- Win what?
- A boxing match. El Royale.

13:29.968 --> 13:31.938
Or are you too weak after being shot?

13:32.008 --> 13:33.948
Everyone is saying
that you've gone soft.

13:38.478 --> 13:40.278
There is nothing soft about me,

13:40.348 --> 13:41.618
and you know I don't lose.

13:42.518 --> 13:43.618
We'll see about that.

13:49.838 --> 13:52.458
Really, Daddy? A boxing match?

13:52.528 --> 13:54.152
Archie challenged me to this fight

13:54.177 --> 13:56.032
in the presence of some
business associates.

13:56.088 --> 13:57.458
I couldn't look weak, Veronica.

13:57.483 --> 13:59.204
- Well, you're not gonna win this.
- Says who?

13:59.228 --> 14:02.258
Says me, and all the odds makers.

14:02.373 --> 14:04.013
What? People are betting on this?

14:04.038 --> 14:05.188
I've already gotten calls.

14:05.258 --> 14:06.483
The underworld's abuzz

14:06.515 --> 14:08.424
asking if I'm taking
bets at La Bonne Nuit.

14:08.449 --> 14:10.018
Obviously, I don't
want any part of it...

14:10.028 --> 14:11.535
Whoa, you said no?

14:13.858 --> 14:16.698
Mija, you can make some money off this.

14:18.828 --> 14:19.828
Maybe.

14:21.018 --> 14:22.858
I mean, I do still
have that debt to you.

14:22.868 --> 14:25.778
Yes, you do. So it's settled.

14:25.858 --> 14:27.674
We'll run all the betting
through La Bonne Nuit.

14:27.698 --> 14:29.148
I'll reach out to some friends,

14:29.173 --> 14:31.868
everyone's gonna want a piece
of the action. It's a win-win.

14:31.878 --> 14:33.708
And Veronica, make no mistake,

14:33.788 --> 14:34.788
I will win.

14:40.408 --> 14:42.168
I'm proud of you, Betty.

14:42.178 --> 14:44.281
It takes courage to face your demons.

14:44.848 --> 14:45.852
Did your darker half

14:45.877 --> 14:47.717
mention the time you
pushed me down the stairs?

14:49.228 --> 14:51.398
Please, I forgave you
for that years ago.

15:00.408 --> 15:01.488
JB?

15:02.768 --> 15:04.208
Do you know where your pal Ricky is?

15:05.158 --> 15:06.288
Is he in trouble?

15:08.398 --> 15:11.588
Ricky's been working
for the Gargoyle King,

15:11.658 --> 15:13.658
and it's putting a lot of
people's lives in danger.

15:19.578 --> 15:21.418
Ricky is in Fox Forest

15:21.428 --> 15:24.518
getting ready to ascend,
whatever that means.

15:24.588 --> 15:26.508
Where? Do you know?

15:26.533 --> 15:28.093
I need you to draw me a map, right now.

15:50.818 --> 15:52.278
Tell me, Betty.

15:52.298 --> 15:54.118
Why have you chosen to return?

15:54.128 --> 15:55.418
To see her again.

15:57.278 --> 15:58.278
My other half,

15:59.448 --> 16:01.048
I need to know what she wants.

16:28.068 --> 16:29.788
Did you miss me, Betty?

16:31.688 --> 16:33.578
Don't worry.

16:33.648 --> 16:35.378
Soon, the one will become many,

16:36.028 --> 16:38.078
and the many one,

16:38.158 --> 16:41.928
and you can finally be your truest self.

16:46.018 --> 16:50.018
And what is that, "my truest self"?

16:51.878 --> 16:54.978
You're a killer just like Dad

16:56.428 --> 16:58.278
and it's time that you embrace that.

17:09.608 --> 17:12.157
Come on, Ricky. Where are you?

17:17.708 --> 17:18.708
Ricky!

17:18.738 --> 17:20.667
You... You shouldn't be here.

17:21.218 --> 17:22.498
No!

17:22.578 --> 17:24.958
What did you do?

17:25.038 --> 17:28.167
Listen, kid. I'm taking you
back to civilization, all right?

17:28.248 --> 17:29.395
I don't want to!

17:29.420 --> 17:30.668
I've played this game.

17:30.688 --> 17:32.728
I know it makes you
do some crazy things,

17:32.798 --> 17:34.058
but I need you alive,

17:34.138 --> 17:35.654
'cause we're gonna end this together.

17:35.679 --> 17:38.139
We answer to no one but our king.

17:38.702 --> 17:39.754
"We"?

17:43.428 --> 17:44.478
Kill him!

17:44.558 --> 17:46.028
Protect the princess.

17:46.768 --> 17:47.778
Princess?

18:15.458 --> 18:16.598
Hellcaster.

18:17.968 --> 18:19.678
Princess Etheline.

18:19.758 --> 18:21.778
Help me, Jughead Jones.

18:21.848 --> 18:22.898
You're my only hope.

18:32.888 --> 18:34.268
What are you doing down here?

18:35.338 --> 18:37.982
Hiding from the Gargoyle King.

18:38.888 --> 18:41.938
I'm terrified he's gonna kill
me for failing my mission.

18:41.948 --> 18:43.318
Mission? What mission?

18:46.868 --> 18:48.528
Wait.

18:48.608 --> 18:51.168
You were the one that told Ricky
to send that letter during prom.

18:53.018 --> 18:56.238
You led Betty right to the
Gargoyle King and the Black Hood?

18:56.263 --> 18:57.552
I thought you quit G&G

18:57.577 --> 18:59.848
after Betty saved you from
The Sisters of Quiet Mercy.

19:01.338 --> 19:05.578
She saved me from the
Sisters' false king, yes,

19:05.658 --> 19:09.338
but then I rejoined the true
king in the woods after...

19:09.348 --> 19:12.013
When I came back to him, he put
me in charge of his lost boys.

19:12.038 --> 19:13.468
That Lord of the Flies gang

19:13.538 --> 19:16.298
that just chased me through
the woods with spears?

19:16.378 --> 19:18.308
Ethel, you're playing G... All right.

19:19.428 --> 19:21.978
You're gonna tell me now, right now,

19:22.048 --> 19:23.481
who the Gargoyle King is.

19:23.506 --> 19:25.770
I can't. I can't betray his trust.

19:25.795 --> 19:28.658
Even when you just said
he's trying to kill you?

19:29.698 --> 19:32.408
He's... He's beautiful.

19:33.300 --> 19:34.650
Despite it all,

19:36.068 --> 19:37.208
I love him.

19:43.528 --> 19:44.828
It's okay.

19:44.853 --> 19:46.943
But you and the lost boys
can't stay in these woods.

19:47.078 --> 19:48.428
You have to end this game.

19:50.248 --> 19:51.248
Will you?

20:01.188 --> 20:04.848
I asked you here because I'm
pulling off my biggest con yet

20:04.928 --> 20:07.528
and I need my best con man for the job.

20:08.718 --> 20:10.018
Haven't we learned our lesson

20:10.043 --> 20:12.763
about mixing business with pleasure?

20:12.888 --> 20:16.078
Mmm. The business is
taking down my father.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.100
So are you in?

20:20.168 --> 20:21.348
For old times' sake?

20:23.658 --> 20:25.758
How could I resist?

20:25.828 --> 20:27.707
What's this emergency, Betty?

20:29.064 --> 20:30.064
Okay...

20:31.508 --> 20:34.718
Edgar Evernever is hypnotizing us.

20:37.467 --> 20:38.677
So?

20:38.702 --> 20:41.418
Hypnotherapy is a standard
therapeutic practice

20:41.443 --> 20:42.818
that people pay good money for.

20:42.843 --> 20:44.603
And whatever Edgar's doing works.

20:44.628 --> 20:45.678
He took my pain away.

20:45.757 --> 20:47.187
I can't wait for him to take mine.

20:47.212 --> 20:48.391
Okay, but that's just it.

20:48.416 --> 20:51.728
I think that he's purposely
inflicting pain on you

20:51.753 --> 20:54.223
- during hypnosis.
- Oh, okay.

20:54.288 --> 20:56.208
Now you just sound koo-koo pants.

20:57.308 --> 20:59.448
Why would Edgar cause us
pain just to take it away?

20:59.458 --> 21:02.578
I don't know, to have
more power over you?

21:02.648 --> 21:05.128
Edgar's our healer, Betty.

21:05.208 --> 21:06.918
And do you have any
proof to the contrary?

21:11.998 --> 21:13.388
Right. Didn't think so.

21:13.458 --> 21:15.008
Okay, bye.

21:18.218 --> 21:19.638
I'll get you proof, Cheryl.

21:20.888 --> 21:22.478
Stand down, lost boys.

21:22.558 --> 21:24.308
The Hellcaster is on our side

21:24.388 --> 21:25.808
and he's come bearing good news.

21:25.818 --> 21:26.878
Our quest is complete.

21:29.298 --> 21:31.888
- Where's Ricky?
- He just took off.

21:31.913 --> 21:33.640
He's probably reporting
back to the Gargoyle King

21:33.664 --> 21:34.722
and the Black Hood.

21:36.783 --> 21:38.043
Jack? Where's Jack?

21:38.068 --> 21:40.708
He went back to the bus
to get his carving knife.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.633
We can't leave Jack behind.
He's the youngest.

21:45.748 --> 21:47.578
Okay, I'll find him.

21:47.603 --> 21:49.563
He's never gonna trust you on your own.

21:49.698 --> 21:50.758
Well, then, come on.

22:04.098 --> 22:06.848
What is all this, Evelyn?

22:06.858 --> 22:10.733
Is this one of your dad,
husband's treatments?

22:11.364 --> 22:12.904
This is dialysis, Betty.

22:13.698 --> 22:15.108
I was very unwell as a child.

22:15.118 --> 22:16.658
My kidneys failed when I was little.

22:17.848 --> 22:19.038
Hmm.

22:24.688 --> 22:25.988
Immuno...

22:25.998 --> 22:29.708
Wait, why are you on anti-rejection med?

22:29.796 --> 22:31.350
Which is what they give you

22:31.375 --> 22:34.700
when you've had an organ transplant?

22:34.738 --> 22:36.038
Not that it's any of your business.

22:36.058 --> 22:38.558
But like I said, I was an ill child.

22:40.628 --> 22:43.598
The scar on Kevin's back,

22:45.048 --> 22:46.808
Fangs's treatment...

22:48.398 --> 22:49.688
Oh, my God.

22:51.068 --> 22:52.188
Edgar is

22:53.258 --> 22:55.558
butchering his disciples,

22:55.568 --> 22:57.648
but it can't all be just for you.

22:57.673 --> 22:58.893
You don't know anything.

23:04.658 --> 23:05.998
You don't know anything!

24:11.008 --> 24:12.008
Jack?

24:13.888 --> 24:15.308
Jack?

24:15.318 --> 24:16.398
Maybe he's on the bus.

24:23.598 --> 24:25.498
Jack, are you here?

24:27.858 --> 24:29.318
I can't find my knife.

24:29.398 --> 24:31.334
Okay, I'll get you a new one,
but right now we have to go.

24:31.358 --> 24:32.598
Why'd you bring the Hellcaster?

24:33.358 --> 24:34.548
It's okay, you can trust him.

24:40.848 --> 24:42.128
Get down, right now.

24:42.208 --> 24:43.798
Shh.

24:43.868 --> 24:46.098
Don't say another word.

25:03.753 --> 25:05.123
Go, go, go, go.

25:05.148 --> 25:06.448
Get the back door. Back door!

25:08.625 --> 25:09.855
It won't budge.

25:10.918 --> 25:12.593
Ethel, open the back door.

25:12.618 --> 25:13.713
It won't budge.

25:13.738 --> 25:15.208
- Ethel, open the door!
- God!

25:16.068 --> 25:17.208
Move, move.

25:20.758 --> 25:22.138
- We gotta go.
- Go, go!

25:33.968 --> 25:35.268
He's going to the front!

25:41.558 --> 25:42.658
Stay back.

25:46.948 --> 25:48.868
That's not gonna
hold him. We have to go.

25:59.144 --> 26:00.144
Archie?

26:01.124 --> 26:02.124
Mom.

26:03.144 --> 26:05.284
You're doing it? Tonight?

26:05.625 --> 26:07.512
Whatever it is that you
and Veronica have planned?

26:07.536 --> 26:08.698
Yes.

26:08.723 --> 26:11.259
But it's better you
don't know the specifics

26:11.284 --> 26:12.853
because I'm sure you're
gonna try and stop me.

26:12.854 --> 26:15.297
After everything that
Hiram has done to you

26:15.322 --> 26:16.403
and to your dad

26:16.428 --> 26:17.519
and to this town,

26:17.755 --> 26:18.755
I wanna watch.

26:40.684 --> 26:43.164
A grand on Hiram Lodge.

26:44.644 --> 26:46.154
Good luck to you.

26:46.164 --> 26:47.364
How are we looking?

26:48.194 --> 26:50.284
Really, really illegal.

26:50.364 --> 26:51.551
In case I haven't said it.

26:51.576 --> 26:53.608
Thank you for doing this, Reggie.

26:53.654 --> 26:54.994
How are you holding up?

26:55.004 --> 26:56.504
By a gossamer thread.

26:56.514 --> 26:59.763
However, it's vital
we keep up appearances.

27:01.043 --> 27:03.853

30:13.760 --> 30:15.360
What is the meaning of this?

30:15.659 --> 30:17.180
You're the owner of this establishment?

30:17.204 --> 30:20.007
Why, no. That would be
my father, Hiram Lodge.

30:20.032 --> 30:22.204
Hmm. You don't happen to
know where to find him?

30:22.498 --> 30:24.948
Why, yes. He's at the
El Royale boxing club

30:24.973 --> 30:27.384
taking part in an illegal
underground boxing match.

30:27.596 --> 30:29.356
Sheriff Jones is expecting you outside.

30:30.406 --> 30:32.537
Ronnie, Ronnie. We've got a problem.

30:32.562 --> 30:34.170
Some last minute bets are coming in,

30:34.195 --> 30:37.086
they all want odds on Hiram
killing Archie in the ring.

31:15.595 --> 31:16.645
This ends now!

31:28.722 --> 31:29.722
Just remember,

31:31.717 --> 31:32.847
you asked for this.

31:33.666 --> 31:34.666
Archie!

31:35.021 --> 31:36.141
Daddy, stop.

31:42.534 --> 31:43.964
I beat you.

31:44.034 --> 31:45.414
I'm the better man.

31:45.494 --> 31:46.494
No.

31:48.954 --> 31:50.304
You lost.

31:50.678 --> 31:52.148
I was just keeping you busy.

31:52.524 --> 31:53.774
Hiram Lodge.

31:55.731 --> 31:58.481
It is with great pleasure

31:59.722 --> 32:02.479
that I say, "You're under arrest."

32:02.504 --> 32:04.143
For what?

32:04.144 --> 32:08.064
For conducting illegal
activities at your establishments.

32:08.134 --> 32:11.064
El Royale boxing club and
La Bonne Nuit speakeasy.

32:11.144 --> 32:12.144
You betrayed me?

32:14.222 --> 32:15.222
Archie.

32:16.222 --> 32:17.222
Are you okay?

32:17.930 --> 32:19.610
Hey, hey.

32:20.414 --> 32:21.454
Did we do it?

32:23.314 --> 32:24.314
We got him.

32:31.341 --> 32:32.441
My own daughter,

32:33.871 --> 32:35.311
working with the feds.

32:42.101 --> 32:43.101
And for what?

32:44.111 --> 32:45.571
An ex-boyfriend?

32:45.596 --> 32:48.196
No, I did this for me, Daddy.

32:49.334 --> 32:51.044
I found out you lied,

32:51.281 --> 32:54.631
that you still held the deeds
to Pop's and La Bonne Nuit.

32:54.711 --> 32:58.591
And it made me very, very angry.

32:59.761 --> 33:01.641
Consider it a lesson learned, mija.

33:01.711 --> 33:04.551
Regardless, all of your assets

33:04.631 --> 33:07.761
are being seized by the
government as we speak.

33:07.841 --> 33:11.691
Your precious empire will
be put up for public auction.

33:11.771 --> 33:15.071
In the meantime, I'll leave
you with this parting thought.

33:16.991 --> 33:19.451
I won.

33:32.041 --> 33:35.171
So you and Veronica are
quite the dynamic duo.

33:35.251 --> 33:36.421
Are you...

33:38.591 --> 33:40.421
I don't know.

33:40.491 --> 33:43.131
Sometimes, it feels like
we're gonna get back together.

33:43.156 --> 33:44.906
But then...

33:44.981 --> 33:47.061
Oh, personally, I think you're endgame.

33:48.711 --> 33:50.761
- Endgame?
- Oh, yeah.

33:50.841 --> 33:53.601
But it doesn't really
matter what I think.

33:53.671 --> 33:55.271
Maybe you should ask
her what she thinks.

34:00.371 --> 34:02.991
Excuse me, Mr. Jones, but
where are the lost boys?

34:04.891 --> 34:06.441
We've assigned a deputy to them.

34:06.521 --> 34:08.531
They'll be under our care
until the Gargoyle King

34:08.541 --> 34:10.201
and the Black Hood are caught.

34:11.759 --> 34:13.359
Excuse me for a minute.

34:16.844 --> 34:20.670
See? We're safe. It's okay, Ethel.

34:20.741 --> 34:22.791
And we're going to find
Ricky, too, I promise.

34:26.630 --> 34:27.630
Thank you.

34:31.920 --> 34:33.021
Thank you.

34:38.071 --> 34:41.911
You deserve a reward for
your bravery, Hellcaster.

34:43.571 --> 34:44.781
I can tell you who he is.

34:45.940 --> 34:46.951
The King.

34:48.150 --> 34:49.150
Who?

34:55.591 --> 34:57.501
But that's impossible.

35:04.121 --> 35:05.631
- Jug.
- Betty.

35:05.711 --> 35:07.761
Are you ready to hear
the craziest thing ever?

35:07.771 --> 35:10.051
Well, I think I might
have you beat on that one.

35:10.131 --> 35:12.941
According to Ethel, Jason Blossom

35:13.011 --> 35:14.261
is the Gargoyle King.

35:14.271 --> 35:15.521
That's not possible, is it?

35:15.601 --> 35:17.851
Normally, I would immediately say no,

35:17.931 --> 35:20.561
but there's only one way
to find out definitively.

35:20.641 --> 35:23.191
A way that would make
Dr. Curdle Jr. proud.

35:23.261 --> 35:25.261
I'm going to have to dig
up Jason's body, aren't I?

35:25.981 --> 35:27.081
Call me afterwards.

35:31.811 --> 35:34.911
Cheryl, the Farm is a front.

35:34.981 --> 35:38.411
Kevin, Fangs, Edgar took their kidneys.

35:38.491 --> 35:40.871
There's a refrigerator
filled to the brim

35:40.896 --> 35:42.471
with human organs.

35:42.541 --> 35:45.501
The Farm, it's an organ farm.

35:45.581 --> 35:47.044
Are you trying to get shipped out

35:47.069 --> 35:48.875
to Shutter Island, you lunatic?

35:55.001 --> 35:56.971
Oh, my God. Is that...

35:56.981 --> 35:58.322
Yes.

35:58.347 --> 36:02.441
Cheryl, what if this is
why he keeps adopting kids?

36:02.511 --> 36:04.601
For his human chop shop?

36:04.681 --> 36:07.661
Based on the price list
I saw in the infirmary,

36:07.731 --> 36:09.231
it's lucrative as hell.

36:09.311 --> 36:10.311
Infirmary.

36:12.331 --> 36:13.996
If there's even a chance you're right,

36:14.021 --> 36:15.277
Toni's procedure is today.

36:15.302 --> 36:16.666
The nurses just took her away.

36:16.691 --> 36:18.222
Okay, go. Go get Toni.

36:18.247 --> 36:19.615
I'll get Kevin and Fangs.

36:25.915 --> 36:27.765
Are you nervous? Don't be.

36:30.851 --> 36:32.301
Get your hands off my girlfriend!

36:32.381 --> 36:33.761
Excuse me...

36:33.831 --> 36:35.681
- What's going on?
- They're charlatans.

36:35.751 --> 36:37.801
- What?
- Not another step.

36:37.881 --> 36:39.101
Get up, Toni. Let's go.

36:39.126 --> 36:40.318
But my treatment...

36:40.343 --> 36:43.027
There's a chance Betty's cries
that the sky is falling are true.

36:43.051 --> 36:44.981
Look at those instruments of torture.

36:45.051 --> 36:46.611
Now please, can we go?

36:48.581 --> 36:50.321
There's a door I snuck Betty in.

36:50.331 --> 36:51.781
Lead the way, my Monte Cristo.

36:58.041 --> 36:59.251
Stop those girls!

37:04.411 --> 37:06.001
Kev, Fangs,

37:06.081 --> 37:08.291
I know that this sounds
crazy, and I'll explain later,

37:08.301 --> 37:11.131
but Edgar's harvesting our organs.

37:11.156 --> 37:12.996
We are all in danger.

37:13.061 --> 37:15.511
You don't know what
you're saying, Betty.

37:15.581 --> 37:17.941
He's taking out the parts
of us that are diseased.

37:19.764 --> 37:22.094
Kev, Fangs.

37:22.119 --> 37:24.519
Why don't we all go talk to
Edgar, clear this whole thing up?

37:27.911 --> 37:30.151
Guys, guys, we don't have to do this.

37:30.221 --> 37:31.521
We can all just go home.

37:31.546 --> 37:32.990
Stop being a detractor, Betty.

37:39.421 --> 37:41.791
Hey, we need some help in
here, we're being attacked.

38:01.351 --> 38:04.061
It's locked. Over here!

38:04.086 --> 38:05.636
We'll never be able to outrun them.

38:05.661 --> 38:06.661
Okay.

38:11.451 --> 38:12.621
Cheryl, come on!

38:13.311 --> 38:16.111
Toni, I love you.

38:16.121 --> 38:17.911
This is your only chance at freedom.

38:20.151 --> 38:21.921
No, run! Go!

38:57.032 --> 38:59.052
Archie. What's going on?

39:00.874 --> 39:02.184
Ronnie, I wanted to tell you...

39:04.492 --> 39:05.772
I needed to tell you.

39:05.852 --> 39:07.572
Wait, before you say anything...

39:10.692 --> 39:11.792
Is there someone else here?

39:14.912 --> 39:15.912
Hey, Andrews.

39:18.032 --> 39:21.422
Reggie was helping me at La
Bonne Nuit earlier tonight

39:22.702 --> 39:25.012
and he came to tell me...

39:25.082 --> 39:27.962
I came to tell her that
I wanted to be with her,

39:28.042 --> 39:29.302
no matter what.

39:29.372 --> 39:32.352
And she said she wanted
to be with me, too.

39:36.052 --> 39:37.052
Is that true?

39:38.842 --> 39:41.982
That is what I said.

39:46.562 --> 39:48.862
- Right, well, uh...
- Wait.

39:48.872 --> 39:50.162
Just stay.

39:51.022 --> 39:52.242
We should celebrate.

39:53.352 --> 39:54.912
We did an amazing thing tonight.

39:56.238 --> 39:57.618
No... No, I'm good. Um...

39:58.692 --> 39:59.812
I'll see you guys at school.

40:26.722 --> 40:27.722
Now,

40:28.892 --> 40:31.982
you put up quite the fight, Betty.

40:32.007 --> 40:34.693
And now you have left me with no choice.

40:37.062 --> 40:39.752
I saw the truth, Mr. Evernever.

40:39.832 --> 40:41.339
I know what you're doing here.

40:42.502 --> 40:45.802
You don't know what you saw, Betty.

40:53.262 --> 40:54.642
They're gonna come for me,

40:55.842 --> 40:58.482
Jughead and his dad.

40:59.102 --> 41:01.262
Nurse.

41:01.342 --> 41:04.572
Can we please prepare
Betty for her procedure?

41:10.782 --> 41:12.282
Don't touch me!
