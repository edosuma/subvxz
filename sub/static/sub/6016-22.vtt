00:04.122 --> 00:05.953
You can't have adultery.
You commit it.

00:06.124 --> 00:09.719
You can't even commit adultery unless
you already have a commitment.

00:09.894 --> 00:13.386
So you have to make the commitment
before thinking about committing it.

00:13.565 --> 00:15.328
There's no commit without the commit.

00:15.500 --> 00:18.901
Then, once you commit,
then you can commit the adultery.

00:19.070 --> 00:21.436
Then you get caught, get divorced,
lose your mind...

00:21.606 --> 00:23.096
...and they have you committed.

00:23.274 --> 00:28.234
You know, some people actually cheat
on the people they're cheating with...

00:28.413 --> 00:30.779
...which is like, you know,
being in a holdup...

00:30.949 --> 00:33.247
...and turning to the robber
next to you and going:

00:33.418 --> 00:35.409
"All right, give me everything
you have too."

00:40.925 --> 00:42.893
You met her
at the supermarket? How?

00:43.061 --> 00:45.621
Produce section.
Very provocative area.

00:45.797 --> 00:48.766
Lots of melons and shapes.
Everyone squeezing and smelling.

00:48.933 --> 00:50.332
It just happened.

00:50.501 --> 00:52.526
- So when you gonna see her?
- Tonight.

00:52.704 --> 00:56.140
- What's her name?
- I don't know.

00:56.307 --> 00:59.276
- How could you not know her name?
- I was nervous. I got distracted.

00:59.444 --> 01:02.004
It had something to do
with a car or a fish.

01:04.015 --> 01:07.451
Look at... Why do I get bananas?
They're good for one day.

01:08.686 --> 01:10.244
Oh, my God. I forgot to tell you.

01:10.421 --> 01:12.981
I got a letter today from
the State Controller's Office.

01:13.157 --> 01:14.749
Back in public school in Brooklyn...

01:14.926 --> 01:17.451
...every week I put 50 cents
in the Lincoln Savings Bank.

01:17.629 --> 01:20.120
- Yeah, I did that too.
- Remember the little bankbook?

01:20.298 --> 01:23.927
I haven't put anything in it since sixth
grade. I completely forgot about it.

01:24.102 --> 01:26.400
The State Controller's Office
tracks me down.

01:26.571 --> 01:28.801
The interest has accumulated
to $ 1900.

01:28.973 --> 01:31.305
Nineteen hundred dollars.
They're sending me a check.

01:31.843 --> 01:34.004
Yeah. Interest. It's an amazing thing.

01:35.046 --> 01:37.412
You make money
without doing anything.

01:37.582 --> 01:40.813
I have some friends that try and base
their whole life on that principle.

01:40.985 --> 01:43.977
- Really? Who?
- Nobody you know.

01:44.589 --> 01:47.149
Maybe I'll go down to the track,
put it all on a horse.

01:47.325 --> 01:49.418
Why don't you put it in the bank.

01:49.594 --> 01:51.892
Bank? This is found money.

01:52.063 --> 01:54.327
I want to parlay it.
I wanna make a big score.

01:54.932 --> 01:56.832
You mean you wanna lose it.

01:57.935 --> 02:01.427
Yeah. All right.

02:03.608 --> 02:05.075
- You got it, huh?
- Yes, I did.

02:05.243 --> 02:07.177
- Yes.
- What's with the gloves?

02:07.345 --> 02:10.711
Well, I'm staining my floors. You know,
I don't wanna get my hands dirty.

02:10.882 --> 02:13.180
- What, the whole apartment?
- The whole apartment.

02:13.351 --> 02:15.478
And I'm buying
that fake-wood wallpaper.

02:15.653 --> 02:19.054
I'm gonna surround myself
in wood.

02:19.223 --> 02:21.589
It's gonna be like a log cabin.

02:21.759 --> 02:24.421
Because I need wood around me.

02:24.595 --> 02:27.860
Wood, Jerry. Wood.

02:28.032 --> 02:29.795
- Wood is good.
- Definitely.

02:29.967 --> 02:32.094
So we're still going to play
racquetball, right?

02:32.270 --> 02:35.103
- Yeah. Whenever you're ready.
- Okay. Soon as Elaine gets here.

02:36.174 --> 02:38.404
- What, you rented Home Alone?
- Yeah.

02:38.810 --> 02:41.074
- I thought you saw that.
- No, I saw Home Alone 2.

02:41.245 --> 02:44.043
Oh, right. But you hated it.

02:44.215 --> 02:47.343
Well, I was lost.
I never saw the first one.

02:48.219 --> 02:50.710
- By the way, you mind if I watch it here?
- What for?

02:50.888 --> 02:53.823
If I watch it at my apartment,
I feel like I'm not doing anything.

02:53.991 --> 02:56.892
If I watch it here, I'm out of the house,
I'm doing something.

02:57.061 --> 02:59.222
All right, go ahead.

03:00.498 --> 03:02.693
- Yeah?
- It's me. Are you ready to go?

03:02.867 --> 03:05.028
No. Come on up.

03:05.203 --> 03:06.830
I can't work with these.

03:07.371 --> 03:11.034
- What's wrong?
- You bought me dishwashing gloves.

03:11.209 --> 03:13.643
- There's no fine touch.
- You said "gloves."

03:13.811 --> 03:16.245
No. No, these are too thick.

03:17.915 --> 03:19.746
- Is that Home Alone?
- Yeah. The original.

03:20.284 --> 03:22.752
- Hey, boys-o.
- Hey!

03:22.920 --> 03:25.821
Hello.

03:25.990 --> 03:27.423
Hey, get your stuff. Let's go.

03:27.592 --> 03:29.492
Wait a minute.
There's a change of plans.

03:29.660 --> 03:32.788
- What?
- Remember Roy, the artist?

03:32.964 --> 03:35.831
- Oh, the triangle guy.
- Yeah. Exactly. The triangle guy.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.592
Yeah. You liked him.
What happened?

03:37.769 --> 03:39.464
Yeah, I did. He was very talented.

03:39.637 --> 03:43.334
He was just, I don't know,
a little too...

03:43.508 --> 03:46.238
- Artsy?
- Fat.

03:46.410 --> 03:48.310
He was a fat starving artist,
you know?

03:48.479 --> 03:50.071
- That's very rare.
- Yeah.

03:50.248 --> 03:52.739
Anyway, he's in the hospital,
he's having surgery...

03:52.917 --> 03:54.942
...and I should go visit him.
- What's wrong?

03:55.119 --> 03:57.679
Something with his spleen.
It'll just take five minutes.

03:57.855 --> 03:59.550
Okay? The hospital's
right on the way.

03:59.724 --> 04:03.023
- All right. We'll wait for you.
- I can get some rubber gloves there.

04:05.096 --> 04:06.996
Listen, Jerry, could you
do me a favor?

04:07.165 --> 04:09.725
Could you go into the room
with me to visit him?

04:09.901 --> 04:13.302
Because I don't want him to think
that I'm, you know, interested.

04:13.471 --> 04:15.598
Oh, you want me to pretend
to be your boyfriend.

04:15.773 --> 04:18.207
- Well...
- Well, I think I can do that.

04:18.375 --> 04:20.901
I've played that role before
to some critical acclaim.

04:21.813 --> 04:23.280
- All right, let's go.
- All right.

04:23.447 --> 04:24.607
- Yep.
- What's with him?

04:24.782 --> 04:27.012
You know, a lot of people
have asked that.

04:33.524 --> 04:36.493
Roy.

04:36.661 --> 04:38.424
Elaine.

04:38.596 --> 04:41.087
What a surprise.

04:41.265 --> 04:43.495
Oh, my God.

04:43.668 --> 04:47.104
I hardly recognize you. You look so...

04:47.271 --> 04:51.173
- Yeah, I've lost some weight.
- A lot of weight.

04:51.342 --> 04:55.574
- I know.
- You look terrific.

04:55.746 --> 04:58.078
Thank you. So do you.

05:01.752 --> 05:06.121
This is... You really lost weight.

05:06.290 --> 05:09.851
- Thank you.
- Jerry. I'm the boyfriend.

05:14.632 --> 05:17.692
Dr. Whittenberg, outside call.

05:17.869 --> 05:20.838
Dr. Whittenberg, outside call.

05:29.413 --> 05:31.677
The mother lode.

05:37.755 --> 05:40.622
I can't believe it. You were huge.

05:40.791 --> 05:42.884
Like blubber.

05:43.060 --> 05:44.891
I couldn't even get my arms
around you.

05:45.062 --> 05:47.394
Yes. I remember.

05:47.565 --> 05:50.090
Well, that's a positive thing
about getting sick.

05:50.268 --> 05:54.329
- You get to lose weight.
- Elaine, it wasn't the illness.

05:54.505 --> 05:56.564
- It was you.
- Me?

05:56.741 --> 06:00.837
Yeah. After you stopped seeing me,
I was devastated.

06:01.012 --> 06:03.071
I couldn't eat for weeks.

06:03.247 --> 06:05.078
Get out!

06:08.686 --> 06:11.587
- Really. It's the truth.
- Jerry, did you hear this?

06:11.756 --> 06:14.020
He couldn't eat for weeks.

06:14.191 --> 06:16.352
That's terrible.

06:18.129 --> 06:21.394
I had no idea I had
that kind of effect on you.

06:21.565 --> 06:23.556
You did.

06:25.002 --> 06:27.869
You know, I can't get
this damn thing to sleep.

06:29.106 --> 06:30.698
Now, listen, Roy, tell me something:

06:30.875 --> 06:33.935
- When are you getting out of here?
- Next Thursday.

06:34.111 --> 06:36.602
Okay, I tell you what.
How about on Friday...

06:36.781 --> 06:41.878
...I take you out for a big meal,
because you are getting too thin.

06:42.053 --> 06:44.078
Honey...

06:47.391 --> 06:51.452
...aren't we going to
the Poconos next Friday?

06:51.629 --> 06:54.359
No, that's the week after.

06:54.532 --> 06:56.762
No, I believe it's next week.

06:56.934 --> 06:59.198
- You're wrong.
- No, I'm not.

07:00.471 --> 07:01.995
Shut up.

07:04.742 --> 07:06.642
Pay dirt.

07:09.480 --> 07:12.176
Roy, this is Kramer.
He's one of our friends.

07:12.350 --> 07:14.944
- How do you do?
- I do great.

07:15.686 --> 07:17.586
- Hi, Roy.
- Hey, Dr. Siegel.

07:17.755 --> 07:21.555
Hey, doc, check this out.

07:21.726 --> 07:24.024
- Hey.
- I just learned that.

07:26.263 --> 07:28.629
I just wanted to stop by...

07:28.799 --> 07:31.529
...see if you had any questions
about tomorrow's operation.

07:31.702 --> 07:34.500
Yeah, yeah, I have...
I have a question.

07:34.672 --> 07:37.641
What do you know about
interabdominal retractors?

07:37.808 --> 07:41.005
Are you asking because
you saw 20/20 last night?

07:41.178 --> 07:43.146
I sure am.

07:43.314 --> 07:47.273
Well, that report was about
one very specific type of retractor.

07:47.451 --> 07:52.252
And I can assure you we do not use
that retractor in your friend's procedure.

07:52.423 --> 07:55.586
But you will use a retractor.

07:55.760 --> 07:57.091
We have to.

08:05.036 --> 08:09.029
I'll tell you what. You're obviously
concerned about your friend's welfare.

08:09.206 --> 08:12.004
A few of my students will be
observing tomorrow's operation...

08:12.176 --> 08:15.407
...from the viewing gallery. How would
you like to watch it with them?

08:15.579 --> 08:18.412
- I'd love to watch the operation, yeah.
- I don't know.

08:18.582 --> 08:20.709
Come on, Jerry,
you gotta see the operation.

08:20.885 --> 08:24.150
They're gonna cut him open.
His guts will be all over the place.

08:24.789 --> 08:27.019
- Yeah, that's true.
- They'll saw through bone.

08:30.761 --> 08:33.092
We'll see what's inside bone.

08:43.140 --> 08:44.698
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:47.545 --> 08:51.481
- What are you doing? You're crying?
- No.

08:51.649 --> 08:53.674
You're crying from Home Alone?

08:55.286 --> 08:58.380
- The old man got to me.
- All right.

08:58.556 --> 09:01.116
Get yourself together.
I don't know if I can be friends...

09:01.292 --> 09:04.455
...with you anymore after this display.
- Oh, shut up.

09:07.098 --> 09:09.532
What are you doing back
so soon, anyway?

09:09.700 --> 09:12.168
I never even got to the gym.
Kramer got the gloves...

09:12.336 --> 09:15.032
...wanted to come home
and start working on his floor.

09:15.206 --> 09:17.174
- How's the guy?
- He's okay.

09:17.341 --> 09:19.536
In fact, him and Elaine
are getting pretty chummy.

09:19.710 --> 09:21.678
Now Elaine wants me to buy
some of his art.

09:21.846 --> 09:24.474
- That's nerve.
- Yeah. So she and triangle boy...

09:24.648 --> 09:26.673
...can go out to fancy restaurants.

09:27.952 --> 09:29.283
You know what it is?

09:29.453 --> 09:31.318
It's Clara Nightingale Syndrome.

09:31.489 --> 09:34.549
- He falls ill, she falls in love.
- You mean Florence Nightingale.

09:34.725 --> 09:37.956
- What did I say, "Clara"?
- You must have meant Clara Barton.

09:38.129 --> 09:42.031
Clara Barton? What did she do?

09:42.867 --> 09:46.325
I'm not sure,
but I think she was nice.

09:47.505 --> 09:50.235
Susan B. Anthony I think
I'd have a problem with.

09:50.407 --> 09:53.069
Yeah, I think you would.

09:53.244 --> 09:54.643
So are you gonna buy his art?

09:54.812 --> 09:56.905
No. Why don't you buy it.
You got $ 1900.

09:57.081 --> 09:59.515
Yeah. That's what I want. Triangles.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.810
I'm out of here.
Have fun with whatshername.

10:01.986 --> 10:03.510
I will.

10:03.687 --> 10:06.554
You know, now you gotta ask her
her name. It's so embarrassing.

10:06.724 --> 10:10.125
- No, it isn't. I can find out.
- Yeah? How?

10:10.294 --> 10:11.761
There are ways.

10:12.963 --> 10:15.227
You know, I remember
when I was a kid growing up...

10:15.399 --> 10:18.163
...kids would make fun of my name
like you wouldn't believe.

10:18.335 --> 10:21.270
"Jerry, Jerry, Dingleberry" and...

10:21.438 --> 10:23.998
..."Seinsmelled."
- Seinsmelled?

10:24.175 --> 10:25.733
Yeah.

10:25.910 --> 10:28.242
What about you? Did people
make fun of your name?

10:28.412 --> 10:30.778
Are you kidding?
They were merciless.

10:30.948 --> 10:32.848
What do you expect
when your name rhymes...

10:33.017 --> 10:35.508
...with a part of the female anatomy?

10:42.860 --> 10:45.852
Of course, not everybody can be
as sweet as you are.

10:49.767 --> 10:54.170
- Oh, Jerry.
- Oh, you.

10:56.907 --> 10:59.273
Now, let's try "breast."

11:03.380 --> 11:05.041
Celeste.

11:05.216 --> 11:07.616
- Kest.
- No.

11:07.785 --> 11:12.620
- Rest. Sest. Hest.
- Hest?

11:12.790 --> 11:14.348
That's not a name.

11:14.525 --> 11:17.221
- You should have just asked her.
- I know I should have asked.

11:17.394 --> 11:20.192
- What are you gonna do now?
- I don't know. I can't ask her now.

11:20.364 --> 11:22.389
I've already made out with her.

11:22.566 --> 11:25.330
Once you make out with a woman,
you can't ask her her name.

11:25.502 --> 11:27.265
Aretha.

11:30.007 --> 11:32.032
No.

11:32.209 --> 11:35.701
- Bovary.
- All right, that's enough.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.947
You know what you gotta do?
You gotta go through her purse.

11:39.116 --> 11:40.674
The credit cards, driver's license.

11:40.851 --> 11:44.343
- Well, how am I gonna do that?
- When she goes to the bathroom.

11:45.222 --> 11:46.519
- There you are.
- Hey.

11:46.690 --> 11:48.180
My date stood me up.

11:48.359 --> 11:51.192
Listen, will you guys go
to the operation with me?

11:52.496 --> 11:55.158
You asked a date
to go to the operation?

11:55.332 --> 11:56.629
Yeah.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.131
So come on. What do you say?

11:58.936 --> 12:01.928
- What kind of operation is it?
- Splenectomy.

12:02.106 --> 12:04.472
- Isn't that where they remove the...?
- Don't ruin it.

12:04.642 --> 12:06.576
I haven't seen it yet.

12:07.211 --> 12:08.610
Now, come on. What do you say?

12:08.779 --> 12:10.440
Mulva.

12:13.284 --> 12:14.876
Mulva?

12:15.052 --> 12:17.043
Come on, come on. You wanna go?

12:17.221 --> 12:18.882
- Come on. Yeah.
- All right. All right.

12:19.056 --> 12:20.853
Just let me finish my coffee.

12:21.025 --> 12:24.483
Then we'll watch them go
slice this fat bastard up.

12:27.464 --> 12:30.661
Now we'll open
the peritoneal cavity...

12:30.834 --> 12:33.564
...exposing the body's
internal organs.

12:33.904 --> 12:36.702
Nurse, retractor.

12:45.082 --> 12:48.711
- What are you eating?
- Junior Mints.

12:48.886 --> 12:50.786
- You want one?
- No.

12:50.954 --> 12:52.945
Now, I can't see.

12:57.761 --> 12:59.661
Could you get...?

13:10.841 --> 13:12.399
Where'd you get those?

13:12.576 --> 13:14.066
- The machine. You want one?
- No.

13:14.244 --> 13:16.007
- Here. Take one.
- I don't want one.

13:16.180 --> 13:17.807
- No, they're good.
- I don't want any.

13:17.981 --> 13:21.041
- Just take one.
- No. Stop... Kramer, stop it.

13:35.065 --> 13:38.557
- Did it go in?
- Yes.

13:43.941 --> 13:46.671
Over the balcony, bounced off
some respirator thing...

13:46.844 --> 13:48.607
...into the patient.

13:50.681 --> 13:52.740
What do you mean,
"Into the patient"?

13:52.916 --> 13:55.077
Into the patient. Literally.

13:55.252 --> 13:58.085
- Into the hole?
- Yes.

13:58.255 --> 13:59.984
The hole.

14:00.157 --> 14:01.920
- Didn't they notice it?
- No.

14:02.092 --> 14:05.755
- How could they not notice it?
- Because it's a little mint.

14:05.929 --> 14:08.056
It's a Junior Mint.

14:11.468 --> 14:13.231
Well, what did they do?

14:13.404 --> 14:15.770
They sealed him up
with the mint inside.

14:15.939 --> 14:19.568
- They left the Junior Mint in him?
- Yes.

14:20.778 --> 14:23.576
Well, l... I guess it can't hurt him.

14:23.747 --> 14:25.408
People eat pounds of those things.

14:25.582 --> 14:27.015
Yes, they eat them.

14:27.184 --> 14:32.281
They don't put them next to vital
organs in their abdominal cavity.

14:34.892 --> 14:36.655
- Yeah.
- It's me.

14:36.827 --> 14:38.226
Come on up.

14:38.395 --> 14:39.885
Hey.

14:40.063 --> 14:42.930
This wallpaper is very good.

14:43.100 --> 14:45.193
My place looks like a ski lodge.

14:45.369 --> 14:47.997
Why'd you force that mint on me?
I didn't want the mint!

14:48.172 --> 14:50.470
- What? I didn't believe you.
- How could you not?

14:50.641 --> 14:53.337
Well, who's gonna turn down
a Junior Mint?

14:53.510 --> 14:56.877
It's chocolate, it's peppermint.
It's delicious.

14:58.282 --> 15:01.479
- That's true.
- It's very refreshing.

15:01.652 --> 15:05.019
Well, just don't say anything
about this to Elaine.

15:07.524 --> 15:09.082
Prognosis...

15:09.259 --> 15:11.056
...negative.

15:11.228 --> 15:13.321
Prognosis negative?

15:13.497 --> 15:15.931
He's not doing well.
The doctors don't know what it is.

15:16.099 --> 15:17.964
They're baffled.

15:18.135 --> 15:20.160
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

15:20.337 --> 15:23.898
Just my luck, you know? Just when
he was getting thin and attractive.

15:24.475 --> 15:26.773
You know, Jerry, you should
buy some of his art.

15:26.944 --> 15:31.074
- That would really lift his spirits.
- It's that bleak?

15:32.649 --> 15:36.176
You know, if the guy dies...

15:36.353 --> 15:38.844
...the art could really be
worth something.

15:39.022 --> 15:40.250
- We gotta confess.
- Really?

15:40.424 --> 15:42.016
- Yes.
- We could be tried for murder.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.558
I can't have this on my conscience.
We're Leopold and Loeb.

15:44.728 --> 15:46.923
- You're not saying anything.
- You can't stop me.

15:47.264 --> 15:49.255
No, you're not!

15:51.502 --> 15:54.494
Hey, Elaine, put me down
for some of that art.

15:54.671 --> 15:56.832
Nineteen hundred dollars' worth.

16:00.744 --> 16:03.110
Yeah, that's the spot.

16:03.280 --> 16:04.872
What are you so tense about?

16:05.048 --> 16:08.381
Nothing, really. Just a homicide.

16:10.554 --> 16:12.522
That's terrific...

16:13.524 --> 16:15.185
...Mulva.

16:22.966 --> 16:24.593
What?

16:25.369 --> 16:27.234
Mulva?

16:28.005 --> 16:29.939
Mulva?

16:30.107 --> 16:31.369
My...

16:31.542 --> 16:34.477
My aunt's name is Mulva.
She's a masseuse.

16:35.546 --> 16:37.605
I'm going to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

16:37.781 --> 16:39.612
Good idea.

16:48.959 --> 16:50.756
What are you doing?

16:51.495 --> 16:54.020
I was just looking for some gum.

16:54.197 --> 16:55.994
- Or a mint.
- I have Junior Mints.

16:56.166 --> 16:57.895
No! No. I mean...

16:58.268 --> 17:00.566
No, thank you. No.

17:04.641 --> 17:07.108
- Any news?
- No. No. You better get out of here.

17:07.277 --> 17:09.006
No, wait a sec. Wait a second.

17:09.313 --> 17:11.611
I don't know the name of
this woman in the bathroom.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.875
So when she comes out,
you introduce yourself.

17:14.050 --> 17:16.041
- She'll be forced to say her name.
- Ten-four.

17:16.219 --> 17:17.982
Okay.

17:18.755 --> 17:21.155
- Hello.
- Hello, I'm Kramer.

17:21.325 --> 17:24.317
- Nice to meet you.
- See you later.

17:26.663 --> 17:29.188
I'd better get going.
I don't wanna be late for the play.

17:29.366 --> 17:31.027
- Okay.
- My cousin knows the producer.

17:31.201 --> 17:33.669
I may get to go backstage
and meet Olympia Dukakis.

17:33.837 --> 17:35.896
- There's a name you don't forget.
- Bye, Jerry.

17:36.073 --> 17:37.563
Bye.

17:39.376 --> 17:41.207
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm George.

17:41.378 --> 17:45.280
- Nice to meet you, George.
- Yeah. I gave it a shot.

17:46.483 --> 17:49.281
So any word on the artiste?

17:49.453 --> 17:51.045
No. I haven't heard anything.

17:51.221 --> 17:53.348
- Well, I got my triangles.
- Really?

17:53.523 --> 17:56.014
Yep. You know, they really
spruce up the apartment.

17:56.193 --> 17:59.993
Yeah, I'm sure. I gotta call the hospital.
I gotta tell them what happened.

18:00.297 --> 18:02.197
- No, no. Jerry, I wouldn't do that.
- Why?

18:02.366 --> 18:03.833
You could get in trouble.

18:04.001 --> 18:05.730
Look, I gotta try and help the guy.

18:05.902 --> 18:08.393
Who are you to play God?!

18:08.572 --> 18:10.335
Every man's time comes.

18:10.507 --> 18:12.566
If his number is up,
who are you to interfere?

18:12.743 --> 18:15.109
Yes, I'd like to speak with Dr. Siegel.

18:15.278 --> 18:17.337
It's about Roy Corning's condition.

18:17.514 --> 18:19.607
- What? What?
- That's fantastic.

18:19.783 --> 18:23.844
- He didn't get better, did he?
- Thank you very much. Okay. Bye-bye.

18:24.021 --> 18:26.148
He's gonna be okay.

18:27.524 --> 18:29.958
Where's the luck?

18:30.127 --> 18:32.652
There's no luck.

18:32.829 --> 18:35.992
Nineteen hundred dollars
down the drain.

18:38.502 --> 18:40.197
You saved my life, George.

18:40.370 --> 18:42.668
You buying my art is what
inspired me to get better.

18:42.839 --> 18:44.773
I'll never forget what you did for me.

18:44.941 --> 18:46.875
Well, that's great. It's really great.

18:47.844 --> 18:49.402
You know, art's a great investment.

18:49.579 --> 18:51.171
They'll be great in your apartment.

18:51.348 --> 18:54.112
Yes, I look forward
to many years of...

18:54.284 --> 18:57.082
...looking at the triangles.

18:58.055 --> 19:00.888
Well, I'll... I'll wait for you outside.

19:01.058 --> 19:04.425
- Hey, George.
- Yeah?

19:06.396 --> 19:07.624
- All right.
- That's nice.

19:07.798 --> 19:09.322
Thanks, Roy.

19:10.901 --> 19:12.300
Hey.

19:12.469 --> 19:15.267
There's the guy who saved my life.

19:15.439 --> 19:18.135
You know, I don't want
to totally discount...

19:18.308 --> 19:21.209
...the emotional element
in your recovery...

19:21.378 --> 19:24.472
...but I think there were
other factors at play here.

19:24.648 --> 19:27.082
- What do you mean?
- I have no medical evidence...

19:27.250 --> 19:31.550
...to back me up, but something
happened during the operation...

19:31.722 --> 19:34.282
...that staved off that infection.

19:34.458 --> 19:37.086
Something beyond science.

19:37.260 --> 19:39.228
Something perhaps...

19:39.396 --> 19:41.125
...from above.

19:43.767 --> 19:45.166
Mint?

19:45.335 --> 19:47.633
Those can be very refreshing.

19:52.075 --> 19:54.202
So Elaine...

19:54.377 --> 19:57.540
...where we going for our
big dinner on Friday?

19:59.716 --> 20:00.910
I'm so sorry, Roy...

20:01.084 --> 20:04.451
...but, actually, we are going to
the Poconos on Friday. Right, honey?

20:04.921 --> 20:06.752
I don't think so.

20:06.923 --> 20:09.414
Yeah, I believe that we...
We are.

20:09.593 --> 20:11.322
I believe we're not.

20:13.330 --> 20:16.356
- Please, can we go to the Poconos?
- Well, I'll think about it.

20:17.901 --> 20:20.392
Great seats. You could see
the actors spitting.

20:20.570 --> 20:21.798
Really.

20:21.972 --> 20:24.304
Afterwards, we went backstage,
and Olympia Dukakis...

20:24.474 --> 20:25.702
...autographed my playbill.

20:27.010 --> 20:29.274
- Wait a second. You got her autograph?
- Yeah.

20:29.446 --> 20:32.506
- Do you have it with you?
- Yeah, it's in my purse.

20:32.682 --> 20:34.843
Let me see.

20:35.485 --> 20:38.818
You know, I really think I'm
falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld.

20:38.989 --> 20:42.720
Well, I really think
I'm falling for you...

20:42.893 --> 20:45.384
..."Joseph Poglia."

20:48.265 --> 20:50.130
I had it autographed for my uncle.

20:50.300 --> 20:52.962
Yeah, I know.

20:53.136 --> 20:55.730
You don't know my name, do you?

20:56.606 --> 20:59.302
- Yes, I do.
- What is it?

20:59.876 --> 21:02.674
It rhymes with a female body part.

21:03.213 --> 21:04.874
What is it?

21:06.249 --> 21:08.217
Mulva?

21:12.222 --> 21:13.985
Gipple?

21:17.460 --> 21:20.054
Loleola?

21:31.341 --> 21:33.866
Dolores!

21:42.285 --> 21:46.915
Ages 0 through 10, candy is
your life. There's nothing else.

21:47.090 --> 21:49.388
Family, friends, school,
they're only obstacles...

21:49.559 --> 21:51.823
...in the way of getting more candy.

21:51.995 --> 21:53.986
You have your favorite candies
that you love.

21:54.164 --> 21:56.428
You know, "I love those. I hate those.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.795
I hate those. I love those."

21:58.969 --> 22:01.563
Only a 7-year-old kid can actually
taste the difference...

22:01.738 --> 22:05.003
...between, like, a red M&M
and a light-brown M&M.

22:05.175 --> 22:08.110
That's two totally different things
when you're a 7-year-old.

22:08.278 --> 22:10.439
"Well, your red is more of
a main-course M&M...

22:10.614 --> 22:12.912
...but the brown, it's a more
of a mellower flavor.

22:13.083 --> 22:16.052
It's an after-dinner M&M, really."
