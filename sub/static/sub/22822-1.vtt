This is you right here.

Great.

02:48.255 --> 02:49.691
So...

Bridget apparently has
a romantic Skype date with Josh

02:53.521 --> 02:55.914
so wanna grab a bite to eat?

02:55.958 --> 02:57.220
No can do.

02:57.264 --> 02:58.439
I gotta go over the expenditures

to unwind.

We got you in this great
townhouse.

Put your feet up, watch
an old Christmas movie.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.410
Order some take-out.

03:13.454 --> 03:14.194
They do have take-out
in this town, right?

03:14.237 --> 03:15.238
No, you're right.

03:15.282 --> 03:17.675
We have a long two weeks
ahead of us.

The Mayor had it set up
for us when we arrived.

04:20.781 --> 04:22.305
Alright, let's focus.

04:22.349 --> 04:24.133
We need to knock this event
out of the park.

04:24.176 --> 04:25.526
And we will.

04:25.569 --> 04:27.005
We agree with the publishers
to market "Me First"

04:27.049 --> 04:30.270
as much as we can and increase
your public visibility.

04:30.313 --> 04:31.401
Remember your second book.

04:31.445 --> 04:33.577
It didn't sell well, I know.

04:33.621 --> 04:34.709
Now, about this event.

04:34.752 --> 04:36.406
Who do are we flying in
to produce it?

04:36.450 --> 04:37.799
Bridget?

04:37.842 --> 04:39.757
Here are the local producers.
There's not many-

04:39.801 --> 04:40.584
Wait, wait, wait.

04:40.628 --> 04:41.411
Locals?

04:41.455 --> 04:42.543
Yeah.

04:42.586 --> 04:44.022
The publishers want us
to hire locally,

04:44.066 --> 04:47.025
generate some opportunity
in the area.

04:47.069 --> 04:49.680
Get you some human interest
press coverage.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.247
Don't worry,
I'll take care of it.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.553
I'll set the appointments.

04:52.596 --> 04:54.424
Also, I know it's not
your favourite subject

04:54.468 --> 04:56.948
but we should talk about this
year's Christmas gift list.

04:56.992 --> 04:57.688
Right.

04:57.732 --> 04:58.820
Christmas gifts.

04:58.863 --> 05:00.474
For my brother David
and his family.

05:00.517 --> 05:02.345
Let's get them really
high-end stuff.

05:02.389 --> 05:05.783
A watch for Suzy, the latest
sneakers for the kids...

05:05.827 --> 05:07.045
That's what you got them
last year.

05:07.089 --> 05:10.092
And for David?

05:10.135 --> 05:12.355
Um... I don't know.

05:12.399 --> 05:14.314
I don't even know
what he likes anymore.

05:14.357 --> 05:16.185
When was the last time
I saw him?

05:16.228 --> 05:17.795
When mom died?

05:20.276 --> 05:21.712
You know what?

05:21.756 --> 05:22.800
I'll take care of it.

05:24.411 --> 05:26.413
Just find me a reliable
producer.

05:26.456 --> 05:28.153
I'm on it.

05:29.720 --> 05:32.070
Your family and friends
sure are lucky.

05:32.114 --> 05:33.550
I'm sorry?

05:33.594 --> 05:36.379
Oh, it's just that these gifts
are really, really nice.

05:36.423 --> 05:41.428
Yeah, well, if you can't
give time, give gifts, right?

05:41.471 --> 05:44.431
Um, so do you want all of these
wrapped and delivered to you?

05:44.474 --> 05:45.823
Yeah, that would be great.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.259
Thank you.

05:47.303 --> 05:50.088
We're really excited to have
you back in Fall Oaks.

05:50.132 --> 05:52.656
Your books have truly
inspired me.

05:52.700 --> 05:53.918
Yeah?

05:53.962 --> 05:55.572
Your first book, by the way,
is my favourite.

05:55.616 --> 05:57.226
"Spark the fire within."

05:57.269 --> 05:58.619
Ever since I read it
I've been dying to go to

05:58.662 --> 06:00.185
one of your big seminars.

06:00.229 --> 06:01.796
That's great.

06:01.839 --> 06:03.363
You should come to the one we're
having in a couple of weeks.

06:03.406 --> 06:06.540
Oh, I'd love to but
it's so expensive.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.846
Who knew inspiration
costs so much, huh?

06:11.371 --> 06:12.763
Excuse me?

06:15.287 --> 06:16.941
Hey.

06:16.985 --> 06:20.380
Um... Santa or snowman?

06:20.423 --> 06:21.381
I'm sorry?

06:21.424 --> 06:22.643
Which one's better?

06:22.686 --> 06:25.036
The uh, the big guy
or the other big guy?

06:25.080 --> 06:26.473
It's for a festive Christmas
sweater party,

06:26.516 --> 06:27.778
I thought I'd wear a tie.

06:27.822 --> 06:30.477
You know, buck the system.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.218
I'm thinking the snowman
kinda brings out my eyes

06:33.262 --> 06:34.959
a little bit more, right?

06:35.003 --> 06:37.048
But green golfing Santa
with the scuba reindeers

06:37.092 --> 06:40.704
really snubs its nose
at convention, doesn't it?

06:43.272 --> 06:46.884
I guess I would go with
the Snowman...

06:46.928 --> 06:47.798
Snowman, right?

06:47.842 --> 06:48.451
Yeah.

06:48.495 --> 06:49.234
Right?

06:49.278 --> 06:50.105
Yeah.

06:50.148 --> 06:50.975
Ok, snowman it is, I think.

06:51.019 --> 06:52.237

07:05.903 --> 07:07.470
No, no, no. I'm-
I'm from Boston.

07:07.514 --> 07:09.603
Snowman tie it is.

07:09.646 --> 07:10.430
Uh, I have to get this.

07:10.473 --> 07:11.822
It's a work thing.

Hey.

Rachel, hey.

07:29.536 --> 07:31.102
I think I found
the perfect producer

07:31.146 --> 07:32.495
and the publishers are on board.

07:32.539 --> 07:33.322
Good.

07:33.365 --> 07:34.410
Wait, where are you?

07:34.454 --> 07:35.890
No, I'm just leaving
the store now.

07:35.933 --> 07:36.978
Please tell me you didn't
buy David socks.

07:37.021 --> 07:38.458
Ok, goodbye.

Oh, goodness.

07:50.687 --> 07:53.124
Are you ok?

07:53.168 --> 07:54.952
I'm ok.

07:54.996 --> 07:56.606
Are you ok?

07:56.650 --> 07:58.869
Yeah, I think I am.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.958
You just saved my life.

08:01.002 --> 08:03.874
Well, I just did what anyone
would do.

08:03.918 --> 08:04.832
No, I'm serious.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.834
You just saved my life.

08:06.877 --> 08:08.879
Is there anything I can do
to thank you?

08:08.923 --> 08:10.141
You just did.

08:10.185 --> 08:11.534
You don't owe me anything.

08:11.578 --> 08:12.535
No, please.

08:12.579 --> 08:13.797
Is there anything I can do?

08:13.841 --> 08:15.320
Seriously?

08:17.584 --> 08:20.630
You can help someone else
who needs help.

08:27.289 --> 08:29.378
Wha- what's your name?

08:29.421 --> 08:30.945
Joy.

08:32.033 --> 08:33.556
My name's Joy.

08:51.705 --> 08:53.097
[knocking]

08:53.141 --> 08:54.577
Why didn't you return
any of my calls last night?

08:54.621 --> 08:55.970
What happened?

08:56.013 --> 08:57.667
Oh, Bridget, can you grab me
an ice pack please?

08:57.711 --> 08:59.016
Of course.

08:59.060 --> 08:59.800
Thank you.

08:59.843 --> 09:01.366
Ice pack?

09:01.410 --> 09:03.194
I almost got hit by a car,
Stuart.

09:04.326 --> 09:05.283
What?

09:05.327 --> 09:06.241
Are you- what?

09:06.284 --> 09:07.547
Wait. Why didn't you call me?

09:07.590 --> 09:08.983
I'm fine.

09:09.026 --> 09:10.245
But I wouldn't have been
if someone hadn't pushed me

09:10.288 --> 09:12.334
out of the way in the nick
of time.

09:12.377 --> 09:13.770
Who was it?

09:13.814 --> 09:16.860
Her name was, uh... Joy.

09:16.904 --> 09:17.557
Joy?

09:17.600 --> 09:18.732
Yeah.

09:18.775 --> 09:20.472
She have a last name?

09:20.516 --> 09:23.258
We didn't get that far.

09:23.301 --> 09:26.087
Christmas Joy Saves
Rachel Kennedy.

09:26.130 --> 09:26.870
I can see it.

09:26.914 --> 09:27.784
We can use this.

09:27.828 --> 09:28.785
Are you serious?

09:28.829 --> 09:29.873
Of course I am.

09:29.917 --> 09:32.006
This is real life, Stuart.

09:32.049 --> 09:35.009
Some random person
came out of nowhere,

09:35.052 --> 09:36.663
swooped in, and saved me.

09:36.706 --> 09:40.623
And, you know, I just can't stop
thinking about the whole thing.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.320
I just feel like saying
the words "thank you"

09:42.364 --> 09:43.713
isn't enough.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.323
I'm sure your "thank you"
was plenty.

09:45.367 --> 09:46.760
Wanna know what
she said to me

09:46.803 --> 09:48.457
when I asked what I could
do to thank her?

09:48.500 --> 09:49.719
What?

09:49.763 --> 09:53.244
She said "help someone else
who needs help".

09:54.463 --> 09:56.204
Does she know who you are?

09:56.247 --> 09:57.422
That's not my point.

09:57.466 --> 09:59.511
You are helping people
every single day.

09:59.555 --> 10:01.601
Every book release,
every seminar you give.

10:01.644 --> 10:04.560
Am I? Am I really?

10:04.604 --> 10:05.822
I mean, would I have done
the same?

10:05.866 --> 10:07.519
So you wanna run around town
saving people

10:07.563 --> 10:08.825
from oncoming traffic?

10:08.869 --> 10:10.653
Thank you.

10:10.697 --> 10:13.351
Look, I understand
that you're feeling

10:13.395 --> 10:15.092
a little emotional
right now,

10:15.136 --> 10:17.007
but we have our biggest
live event

10:17.051 --> 10:19.706
in less than two weeks
and I have our new producer

10:19.749 --> 10:22.056
waiting for us in
the conference room.

10:22.099 --> 10:23.100
Wait, what?

10:23.144 --> 10:23.927
Right now?

10:23.971 --> 10:25.146
Yes, now.

10:25.189 --> 10:26.495
[sighs]

10:26.538 --> 10:28.323
So who am I meeting?

10:28.366 --> 10:30.020
The top local event producer

10:30.064 --> 10:32.501
who's also done some
major work out of town.

10:32.544 --> 10:34.634
The publishers think he can
deliver exactly what we need.

10:34.677 --> 10:36.244
Great. What's his name?

10:36.287 --> 10:38.289
Rachel, I'd like you
to meet...

10:41.728 --> 10:44.034
Jack.

10:44.078 --> 10:46.558
So how did it work
out with the tie?

10:46.602 --> 10:48.299
Oh, it was a big, big hit.

10:48.343 --> 10:49.779
Wait a second, you two know
each other?

10:49.823 --> 10:51.694
Oh, yeah, yeah, we go way
back, like yesterday.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.130
Right.

10:53.174 --> 10:55.176
Jack needed my professional
opinion at the store.

10:55.219 --> 10:57.439
My, you were busy yesterday.

10:57.482 --> 10:59.484
Jack, do you have
your resumé

10:59.528 --> 11:01.269
and a sample of your work?

11:04.315 --> 11:07.188
Creative producer
for live events,

11:07.231 --> 11:11.627
tour events and even some
of my favourite music.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.411
What're you doing
in this town?

11:13.455 --> 11:16.414
I guess you never know
where life takes you.

11:16.458 --> 11:19.461
And um, who is...
who is Paul Taylor?

11:19.504 --> 11:20.636
He's my associate.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.203
You know, right-hand man.

11:22.246 --> 11:23.726
You'll meet him soon enough.

11:23.770 --> 11:26.555
A portfolio like this means
you must be...

11:26.598 --> 11:28.731
married to your job?

11:28.775 --> 11:30.777
Work never complains
about my commitment issues.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.082
[chuckles]

11:32.126 --> 11:34.563
At least you're honest.

11:34.606 --> 11:36.173
Why don't we, um...
why don't we sit down?

11:36.217 --> 11:37.435
Great.

11:40.047 --> 11:44.181
Now, um... let me be honest.

11:44.225 --> 11:46.270
No one knows my brand
better than I do.

11:46.314 --> 11:47.576
Right.

11:47.619 --> 11:49.099
Can I tell you why
I took this job?

11:49.143 --> 11:51.841
I see potential in your event.

11:51.885 --> 11:54.452
That it can really make
a positive impact

11:54.496 --> 11:56.367
on this town and beyond.

11:56.411 --> 11:57.717
Potential?

11:57.760 --> 12:00.110
I mean, we're already making
a positive impact.

12:00.154 --> 12:02.156
Researching you
for the last 48 hours,

12:02.199 --> 12:06.334
there are a few things that
I suggest doing differently.

12:06.377 --> 12:07.944
I told you the red suit
on the cover made you look

12:07.988 --> 12:09.380
a little standoff-ish.

12:09.424 --> 12:10.730
The suit's the least
of your concerns.

12:10.773 --> 12:12.644
Can I be completely candid
with you right now?

12:12.688 --> 12:14.342
Oh, so that was you
not being candid?

12:14.385 --> 12:15.735
I saw you on the news
the other night.

12:15.778 --> 12:17.780
Even answering questions,
it just-

12:17.824 --> 12:21.653
it felt a little too planned.
Too clever.

12:21.697 --> 12:23.351
We do have a strategy when
it comes to selling Rachel's

12:23.394 --> 12:26.049
new book that we don't wanna
deviate from,

12:26.093 --> 12:27.703
which is why the Rachel
Kennedy's

12:27.747 --> 12:30.750
Inspiration Celebration event
has to be the best ever.

12:32.186 --> 12:34.101
I think the core message
for this event

12:34.144 --> 12:36.668
should maybe reflect
who you are.

12:36.712 --> 12:38.148
Helping others.

12:38.192 --> 12:39.497
Giving to others.

12:39.541 --> 12:42.109
Which means more involvement
in the community.

12:42.152 --> 12:46.113
In order to inspire you have
to connect on a deeper level.

12:46.156 --> 12:49.072
What better way to connect
and to celebrate

12:49.116 --> 12:51.422
than by making this event
more about Christmas

12:51.466 --> 12:54.861
than about some...
some image?

12:54.904 --> 12:57.428
May I also suggest adding
"Christmas" to the title?

12:57.472 --> 13:00.083
Maybe calling it "The Christmas
Inspiration Celebration"?

13:00.127 --> 13:01.519
Right.

13:01.563 --> 13:05.567
Well, see, Christmas is not
necessarily my forté.

13:08.048 --> 13:11.051
Ok. Maybe I'm not the best
person for this job.

13:12.095 --> 13:13.836
Maybe you're right.

13:15.577 --> 13:17.535
Ok. Well, I wish you the best of
luck with everything.

13:17.579 --> 13:18.362
Thank you.

13:18.406 --> 13:19.450
I hope it all goes well.

13:19.494 --> 13:20.669
Wait, no. Jack, just
one sec please.

13:20.712 --> 13:22.932
Rachel, can I talk to you
for a moment?

13:24.151 --> 13:25.935
Yes. Thank you.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.719
We'll just be a minute.

13:31.332 --> 13:32.812
Hey.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.118
What're you doing?

13:35.162 --> 13:37.120
I don't like his approach.

13:37.164 --> 13:38.774
Look, he's the only person
in this town

13:38.818 --> 13:41.298
with enough experience to make
this event successful.

13:41.342 --> 13:43.518
Well, I'm sure we can hire
someone else.

13:43.561 --> 13:45.128
You saw his resumé.

13:45.172 --> 13:46.869
He ran his own company
in Boston.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.392
He knows what he's doing.

13:48.436 --> 13:50.438
Just for now,
for the publishers,

13:50.481 --> 13:52.614
let's see where
he takes this, ok?

13:58.185 --> 14:01.057
Ok, we can try to weave
a little bit of Christmas

14:01.101 --> 14:02.842
into the event.

14:02.885 --> 14:03.668
Ok, that's good news.

14:03.712 --> 14:04.887
Good, good, good.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.280
And see? Look at that.

14:06.323 --> 14:07.237
You're already getting
into the Christmas spirit.

14:07.281 --> 14:09.500
Nice. Ok, we should get started.

14:09.544 --> 14:10.893
Started with what?

14:10.937 --> 14:12.503
Oh, we wanna get you out there
among the people,

14:12.547 --> 14:14.549
soaking in the holiday...

14:14.592 --> 14:17.030
Have you ever been to the town
hot cocoa contest?

14:17.073 --> 14:19.293
I bet even you can't resist
a nice good cup of hot cocoa.

14:19.336 --> 14:20.947
Right, see, I've never really
understood that contest.

14:20.990 --> 14:23.384
I mean, how many ways are
there really to make it?

14:23.427 --> 14:24.994
I don't know.

14:25.038 --> 14:26.909
I guess we're gonna find out
because we are going tonight.

14:26.953 --> 14:29.346
And you're going with me
because this is all your idea.

14:29.390 --> 14:31.696
By the way, the only way I
know how to produce an event

14:31.740 --> 14:32.959
for someone is by getting
to know them

14:33.002 --> 14:35.091
so from now on
you're stuck with me.

14:35.135 --> 14:36.788
Fantastic.

14:36.832 --> 14:37.833
The coffee is spectacular.

14:37.877 --> 14:38.921

the best.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.314
Yeah, but- can you just-

14:40.357 --> 14:41.793
what brought you here
to Fall Oaks?

14:41.837 --> 14:43.708
Because it seems like
you've got a pretty successful

14:43.752 --> 14:45.580
career in Boston.

14:45.623 --> 14:48.191
Oh, this is it.
Hot cocoa contest.

14:48.235 --> 14:49.366
This is it?

14:49.410 --> 14:50.411
Get in there.

14:50.454 --> 14:52.021
Ok.

14:54.545 --> 14:57.070
How long have you been
managing Rachel?

14:57.113 --> 15:00.247
I've been with her
since her first book.

15:00.290 --> 15:01.726
"Spark the Fire Within."

15:01.770 --> 15:02.727
About five years now.

15:02.771 --> 15:03.946
Five. Wow.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.687
In our line of work
that's like a century.

15:05.730 --> 15:07.210
Tell me about it.

15:07.254 --> 15:08.908
It's been a little bit of
a roller coaster ride.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.953
Her second book "You Deserve
it All" didn't do as well

15:10.997 --> 15:12.781
as the publishers
would have liked,

15:12.824 --> 15:15.523
which is why we're doing such
a huge push on "Me First."

15:15.566 --> 15:17.742
And that's why you're here.

15:17.786 --> 15:19.440

that we get

you know, we- um,

to see him yet.

and, you know, everything.

I'm sure you're very busy
but he's family.

21:39.559 --> 21:43.954
We make time for what we
wanna make time for, right?

21:48.045 --> 21:49.525
This may seem out
of the ordinary

21:49.569 --> 21:54.269
but I could use your help.

21:54.313 --> 21:57.359
With what?

21:57.403 --> 22:03.191
The work that you do
is special and important.

22:03.234 --> 22:06.803
It inspires me and it reminds me

22:06.847 --> 22:11.460
of why I wanted to make a
difference in the first place.

22:11.504 --> 22:14.942
I could just really use
your help.

22:14.985 --> 22:21.862
I think maybe your idea of
helping people,

22:21.905 --> 22:25.344
um, may be a little different
from my own.

22:28.129 --> 22:31.175
Ok, I understand.

or if you need anything,

22:38.574 --> 22:41.534

22:41.577 --> 22:43.405
Hmm.

22:43.449 --> 22:44.711
Ok.

22:44.754 --> 22:46.452
Ok.

on that composer?

22:48.497 --> 22:50.804
Do you know how much music
can affect your audience?

22:50.847 --> 22:52.762
So, what? You're saying
that I need new entrance

22:52.806 --> 22:53.720
and exit music?

22:53.763 --> 22:54.547
Yeah.

22:54.590 --> 22:55.461
Why?

22:55.504 --> 22:57.114
Because it's stale and aloof.

22:57.158 --> 23:00.509
And you are neither of those
things, most of the time.

23:00.553 --> 23:01.423
Excuse me?

23:01.467 --> 23:02.946
Look at this.

23:04.774 --> 23:05.427

to redefine myself-

23:05.471 --> 23:06.776
That's the girl.

23:06.820 --> 23:08.996
As a voice for those
who were hurting like me.

23:09.039 --> 23:10.867
That is the message
we have to get back to.

23:10.911 --> 23:12.391
Where did that girl go?

23:12.434 --> 23:14.436
Stuart and the publishers
wanted something different.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.829
And if my publishers
are happy

23:15.872 --> 23:17.439
that means that I'm happy.

23:17.483 --> 23:18.658
R- really?

23:18.701 --> 23:20.050
You'd rather make
your publishers happy

23:20.094 --> 23:24.403
than actually help people
who need your help?

23:24.446 --> 23:25.578
Ok, fine.

23:25.621 --> 23:27.188
What do you- what do
you have in mind?

23:27.231 --> 23:29.233
As I said, I think we should
focus on the Christmas spirit.

23:29.277 --> 23:31.888
No. I have already told you,
Christmas is not my forté.

23:31.932 --> 23:33.237
Why do you keep saying that?

23:33.281 --> 23:34.891
Because Christmas is ha-

23:34.935 --> 23:38.939
because it's hard when you've
lost people that you love.

23:38.982 --> 23:41.724

doesn't help.

23:44.118 --> 23:45.641

Let's go!

30:48.498 --> 30:50.326
It's a good looking tree.

30:50.370 --> 30:52.024
Yeah.

30:52.067 --> 30:53.982
I actually think that this
might be the best one

30:54.026 --> 30:56.942
that I have ever had.

30:56.985 --> 30:59.901
Actually, when I was young
I used to always choose the tree

30:59.945 --> 31:02.425
that I thought that no one else
would ever want.

31:02.469 --> 31:06.038
You know, so that they would
have a home for Christmas, too.

31:06.081 --> 31:08.910
And my whole family would
always laugh at me

31:08.954 --> 31:12.783
but those misfit trees
always came home with us.

31:12.827 --> 31:14.263
I think that's awesome.

31:14.307 --> 31:16.831
Yeah.

31:16.875 --> 31:20.835
It's been a long time
since I've done this.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.185
Since my dad passed away.

31:23.229 --> 31:25.796
And he had a knack
for gaudy decorations.

31:25.840 --> 31:29.191
He had one of those plastic
Santa Clauses that came up

31:29.235 --> 31:30.671
from the chimney.

31:30.714 --> 31:32.020
Oh yeah. I know the exact one
you're talking about.

31:32.064 --> 31:32.760
Right?

31:32.803 --> 31:33.892
Yep.

31:33.935 --> 31:35.067
I swear that any plane
that passed by

31:35.110 --> 31:37.852
could see that monstrosity.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.811
Oh, and he was
so proud of it.

31:42.944 --> 31:45.860
I haven't thought
about that in so long.

31:46.992 --> 31:50.952
You know, losing my mom
and my dad and the memories

31:50.996 --> 31:55.261
they created for my brother,
David, and me.

31:55.304 --> 31:57.916
I miss that.

31:57.959 --> 31:59.961
I miss that a lot.

32:00.005 --> 32:01.963
But it's nice being able
to remember it

32:02.007 --> 32:06.141
and actually smile about it,
you know?

32:06.185 --> 32:07.969
What about you?

32:08.013 --> 32:11.451
Was Christmas like a...
a big deal in your family?

32:11.494 --> 32:13.148
Oh gosh, yeah.
It sure was.

32:13.192 --> 32:17.239
Was? Past tense?

32:17.283 --> 32:19.981
I lost both of my parents,
too.

32:20.025 --> 32:22.418
I'm so sorry.

32:22.462 --> 32:24.551
Thanks.

32:24.594 --> 32:28.903
It was uh... it was hard
for a long time.

32:28.947 --> 32:33.995
You know, not having...
not having any family anymore.

32:34.039 --> 32:35.388
And I was an only child.

32:35.431 --> 32:38.434
They were both older when
they adopted me, so...

32:38.478 --> 32:39.696
You were adopted?

32:39.740 --> 32:40.697
Yeah.

32:40.741 --> 32:42.003
When I was a baby.

32:42.047 --> 32:47.008
My parents were...
they were amazing.

32:47.052 --> 32:49.793
They never made me feel like
I wasn't part of them.

32:49.837 --> 32:53.580
Hmm. But I still wondered.

32:53.623 --> 32:55.321
What do you wonder?

32:55.364 --> 32:57.149
Just, you know,
where I came from.

32:57.192 --> 32:59.020
My biological parents.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.195
Who they were.

33:00.239 --> 33:01.718
Why did they give me up?

33:01.762 --> 33:03.982
Just... you never stop.

33:04.025 --> 33:06.027
I didn't.

33:06.071 --> 33:08.029
Do you ever think about
trying to find them?

33:08.073 --> 33:09.378
Sure.

33:09.422 --> 33:11.554
Yeah, a lot more now.

33:11.598 --> 33:13.034
Since mom and dad passed

33:13.078 --> 33:16.646
the idea of having
family out there...

33:16.690 --> 33:21.042
you know, makes it
feel a little less-

33:21.086 --> 33:23.914
a little less alone
in this big world.

33:23.958 --> 33:25.046
Yeah.

33:25.090 --> 33:27.005
So yeah, I do wanna find
them someday.

33:28.745 --> 33:30.443
Rachel Kennedy,
I'm telling you,

33:30.486 --> 33:32.706
if this event tanks

33:32.749 --> 33:36.275
we can definitely fall back on
our interior decorating skills.

33:36.318 --> 33:38.842
Or, you know, we could um,

33:38.886 --> 33:42.324
also maybe go pro in
candy cane relay races.

33:42.368 --> 33:44.631
[laughing]

33:49.418 --> 33:52.247
You know, I um...
I have this rule

33:52.291 --> 33:55.381
about getting involved with
people that I work with.

33:55.424 --> 33:56.338
Yes.

33:56.382 --> 33:57.600
It's absolutely fine.

33:57.644 --> 33:59.254
I um... there's- we have
a lot to do.

33:59.298 --> 34:00.821
Yeah.

34:00.864 --> 34:04.694
You know, work always comes...
first.

34:32.547 --> 34:35.246
[knocking]

34:35.290 --> 34:36.552
I got it.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.123
David, hi.

34:42.167 --> 34:44.777
Hi.

34:44.821 --> 34:46.954
I was wondering if you'd
ever come by.

34:46.996 --> 34:49.478
Yeah, I was just waiting
for the right time.

34:49.522 --> 34:51.393
Oh yeah?

34:51.437 --> 34:53.351
How long you been in town?

34:56.268 --> 34:58.008
Oh, right.

34:58.052 --> 35:00.054
Well, I'd invite you in but
Suzie and I were about

35:00.098 --> 35:01.795
to take the kids to school.

35:01.838 --> 35:04.711
It's the last day
before Christmas break, so...

35:04.754 --> 35:05.886
[Suzie]: David, we gotta go,
we're late!

35:05.929 --> 35:07.105
Right. Right, yeah.

35:07.148 --> 35:09.542
Um, yeah. I'll let you go.

35:09.585 --> 35:12.980
I'm- I shouldn't have come
by unannounced, anyway.

35:13.023 --> 35:15.896
Well, it's good to have
you back,

35:15.939 --> 35:19.856
and uh, good luck with the event
and everything.

35:19.900 --> 35:21.771
Thanks.

35:21.815 --> 35:23.295
Okay.

35:23.338 --> 35:26.341
Um, and I'm uh, I'm having
a Christmas party, you know,

35:26.385 --> 35:28.691
if you were around and you

35:28.735 --> 35:30.998
and the family wanted
to stop by.

35:31.041 --> 35:33.261
David! David, come on!

35:33.305 --> 35:36.438
You know, it's a pretty busy
time for all of us right now.

35:36.482 --> 35:39.311
Right. Of course.

35:39.354 --> 35:41.617
Anyway, have a good morning.

35:41.661 --> 35:43.010
Thanks, you too.

35:43.053 --> 35:45.230
Merry Christmas, Rach.

35:50.539 --> 35:54.064
And, it's like I said in chapter four in "Me First."

35:54.108 --> 35:56.154
The true path to success

35:56.197 --> 35:59.200
is clearing away any
unnecessary distractions

35:59.244 --> 36:01.289
and putting yourself first.

36:01.333 --> 36:02.638
Why do you think airlines

36:02.682 --> 36:05.163
tell you to put on your own
oxygen mask first?

36:05.206 --> 36:07.556
Because if you don't
take care of you,

36:07.600 --> 36:10.429
how can you take care of others?

36:10.472 --> 36:15.999
You cannot make anyone happy
until you're happy.

36:16.043 --> 36:22.789
When I finally did this for
myself my whole world changed.

36:22.832 --> 36:25.966
I'm sorry, Joy, what is it?

36:26.009 --> 36:30.623
I'm not sure this is the exact
kind of message

36:30.666 --> 36:34.148
we wanna send
at Christmas time,

36:34.192 --> 36:36.629
or at any time,
for that matter.

36:36.672 --> 36:40.937
Right, I know, um, but
this is directly from my book.

36:40.981 --> 36:42.678
I think it sounds great.

36:42.722 --> 36:44.811
Hey, there he is.

36:44.854 --> 36:48.118
Joy, I'd like you to meet Austin
Holberg of Holberg Publishing,

36:48.162 --> 36:49.207
our publishing house.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.120
Hello.

36:50.164 --> 36:51.034
Pleasure to meet you.

36:51.078 --> 36:51.818
Joy, is it?

36:51.861 --> 36:53.863
Yes.

36:53.907 --> 36:55.256
I'm sorry, Joy, you were saying?

36:55.300 --> 36:56.997
Oh, I think we've heard enough.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.869
Go ahead. I'd like you to finish
your thought.

37:02.350 --> 37:07.268
The thing you say about airplane
passengers and oxygen?

37:07.312 --> 37:09.749
It's counter-intuitive
to help yourself

37:09.792 --> 37:12.404
before you help someone else.

37:12.447 --> 37:15.363
That's why they
instruct you to do so.

37:15.407 --> 37:21.848
It's an exception to the way
people should behave.

37:21.891 --> 37:24.459
And Christmas is a time
of giving.

37:24.503 --> 37:26.766
We all know that.

37:26.809 --> 37:30.291
And giving can cause
a ripple effect,

37:30.335 --> 37:32.380
and I think it-

37:32.424 --> 37:35.731
it should be the message
that we're sending.

37:37.167 --> 37:39.082
That's interesting.

37:39.126 --> 37:40.519
I like that.

37:40.562 --> 37:42.303
I think I'm gonna- I'm gonna
think about that.

37:42.347 --> 37:44.262
Rachel?

37:44.305 --> 37:46.176
If you'll excuse me.

37:46.220 --> 37:47.700
Alright. I'll call you.

37:47.743 --> 37:50.050
Rachel, can I uh, have a moment
with you please?

37:50.093 --> 37:51.573
Just a sec.

37:57.144 --> 37:59.712
Austin is one of the most
important publishers around.

37:59.755 --> 38:02.323
He's flown in in support
of your event.

38:02.367 --> 38:03.498
We agreed to a plan
with him.

38:03.542 --> 38:04.978
You need to stick to it.

38:05.021 --> 38:07.807
You know, ever since
Joy has been around

38:07.850 --> 38:09.156
you seem distracted.

38:09.199 --> 38:11.201
You know what, Stuart?

38:11.245 --> 38:14.640
For years I have been going
a mile a minute,

38:14.683 --> 38:15.815
always focusing on work

38:15.858 --> 38:18.600
so don't talk to me
about distraction.

38:18.644 --> 38:21.516
Look, this could be
our biggest deal yet.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.518
All you gotta do is play along
with what Austin

38:23.562 --> 38:25.259
and the other publishers want
your message to be.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.434
That's it.

38:28.828 --> 38:30.569
Rachel.

38:33.223 --> 38:34.181
I will be right there.

38:34.224 --> 38:36.618
I will figure something out.

38:36.662 --> 38:37.706
Ok.

38:41.014 --> 38:43.103
I hope I didn't speak
out of line before.

38:43.146 --> 38:44.496
No, no, no.

38:44.539 --> 38:45.845
Not at all.

38:45.888 --> 38:47.716
This is the reason
that I have you here.

38:47.760 --> 38:49.718
They need me at
the community centre.

38:49.762 --> 38:51.633
There's a little bit of
an emergency.

38:51.677 --> 38:53.113
Oh no, what is it?

38:53.156 --> 38:56.159
Our annual Christmas party
is about to be cancelled.

38:56.203 --> 38:59.032
The money just isn't there.

38:59.075 --> 39:02.557
The families and the children,
they really need this party.

39:02.601 --> 39:03.384
You know what?

39:03.428 --> 39:04.994
I think I have an idea.

39:05.647 --> 39:07.170
Reggie, hey.

39:09.303 --> 39:10.783
Good.

01:05:43.852 --> 01:05:45.376
This is the exact same photo
that my parents

01:05:45.419 --> 01:05:47.813
had on our mantle.

01:05:47.856 --> 01:05:49.858
This is me.

01:05:52.861 --> 01:05:54.559
What?

01:05:59.216 --> 01:06:02.088
Is Joy...

01:06:02.132 --> 01:06:05.091
is she my mother?

01:06:05.135 --> 01:06:07.572
I- I don't know.

01:06:07.615 --> 01:06:09.139
Did you know about any-
did she know-

01:06:09.182 --> 01:06:10.705
No!

01:06:10.749 --> 01:06:14.883
All I know is that I- I just
found out that she had a son

01:06:14.927 --> 01:06:19.366
and she gave him up for adoption
a long time ago.

01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:23.414
The photo that you're holding
in your hand must be of him.

01:06:23.457 --> 01:06:27.026
Or, I don't know,
I guess of... you.

01:06:30.377 --> 01:06:34.338
What do I say to her?

01:06:34.381 --> 01:06:36.993
It's just like you told me.

01:06:37.036 --> 01:06:39.212
If it's coming from
your heart then how

01:06:39.256 --> 01:06:41.910
can you possibly go wrong?

01:06:53.792 --> 01:06:58.057
Something hit me
when I first saw you.

01:06:58.101 --> 01:07:02.540
I just didn't know
what it was.

01:07:02.583 --> 01:07:07.066
I looked all over
for that picture.

01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:09.677
I thought I had lost it.

01:07:09.721 --> 01:07:12.506
Where was it?
Where'd you find it?

01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:16.162
The Apple Garden.

01:07:16.206 --> 01:07:18.512
It was in the copy
you gave to Rachel.

01:07:18.556 --> 01:07:20.340
Right.

01:07:23.735 --> 01:07:28.435
I cannot tell you how often
I looked at that picture.

01:07:28.479 --> 01:07:31.351
Over and over and over.

01:07:31.395 --> 01:07:35.138
It was all I had.

01:07:35.181 --> 01:07:39.185
I was not allowed to have
any contact with you.

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:50.544
Do I have brothers
and sisters?

01:07:52.894 --> 01:07:54.461
No.

01:07:56.507 --> 01:08:00.467
I had only one child.

01:08:00.511 --> 01:08:05.777
A beautiful baby boy.

01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:14.742
I've held you, in here,
for 35 years.

01:08:14.786 --> 01:08:19.312
I've made up all these- these
stories in my mind about...

01:08:19.356 --> 01:08:20.921
about why you would
give me up for adoption.

01:08:20.966 --> 01:08:22.010
Was I not good enough?

01:08:22.054 --> 01:08:23.055
Was I not-

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:24.839
You were perfect.

01:08:24.883 --> 01:08:27.059
You were perfect.

01:08:30.671 --> 01:08:32.673
I was so young and so...

01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:43.858
alone,

01:08:43.902 --> 01:08:49.647
and so unable to give you
the kind of life that I...

01:08:49.689 --> 01:08:53.651
I wanted you to have.

01:08:53.694 --> 01:08:55.913
Did you have
a good life?

01:08:55.957 --> 01:08:58.264
Have you had a good life?

01:09:01.832 --> 01:09:03.573
Yeah.

01:09:08.883 --> 01:09:12.017
It's been pretty good.

01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:14.411
Pretty good.

01:09:17.327 --> 01:09:18.763
I'm sorry, this is all-

01:09:18.805 --> 01:09:21.243
it's just a little too much
for me to-

01:09:21.287 --> 01:09:22.636
for me to soak in right now.

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:25.944
I just... I just need to take
a little time and-

01:09:25.987 --> 01:09:30.122
and let it all sink in,
I think, if that's...

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:30.904
Of course.

01:09:30.948 --> 01:09:31.993
If that's ok with you.

01:09:32.037 --> 01:09:33.343
Of course.

01:09:33.386 --> 01:09:35.823
Take- take all the time
you need.

01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:48.227
Ten percent gain on-
that one there?

01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:50.185
Yeah, I think so.

01:09:56.670 --> 01:09:57.976
Hey.

01:09:58.019 --> 01:09:59.151
Joy.

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:01.675
I was looking for the piano.

01:10:01.719 --> 01:10:03.024
I need to clear my head.

01:10:03.068 --> 01:10:04.330
Would it be ok if I play?

01:10:04.374 --> 01:10:05.636
Perfect timing.

01:10:05.679 --> 01:10:06.941
We're just about to sound
check it, anyways.

01:10:06.985 --> 01:10:08.334
Please. Please.

01:10:08.378 --> 01:10:10.206
Be my guest.

01:10:14.993 --> 01:10:18.605
So are you still heading back
to LA right after the event?

01:10:18.649 --> 01:10:20.128
I tried to get here
on time but...

01:10:20.172 --> 01:10:22.870
Hey, that's not a problem.

01:10:22.914 --> 01:10:24.698
You ok?

01:10:27.658 --> 01:10:29.268
I think I'm in a much better
place now, yeah.

01:10:29.312 --> 01:10:30.487
Thanks.

01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:33.490

some candy canes

01:13:47.988 --> 01:13:49.468
Hey.

01:13:49.512 --> 01:13:52.863
Um... thank you.

01:13:52.906 --> 01:13:54.168
You know that I could
never have done

01:13:54.212 --> 01:13:56.214
any of this without you.

01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:01.915
I couldn't have made it through
the last 12 hours without you.

01:14:06.659 --> 01:14:08.574
Ok.

01:14:30.291 --> 01:14:31.989
[Austin]: Are we all ready
for tomorrow?

01:14:32.032 --> 01:14:33.947
[Stuart]: Yes, and you won't
be disappointed.

[Austin]: Good.

01:14:35.819 --> 01:14:37.951
[Stuart]: I just sent you a
video I took with my phone.

01:14:37.995 --> 01:14:40.301
It's footage of Rachel
volunteering

01:14:40.345 --> 01:14:42.826
at the Fall Oaks
community centre.

01:14:42.869 --> 01:14:45.263
How's that for a home grown
Christmas story?

01:14:45.306 --> 01:14:47.395
Of course, Rachel did this
to strengthen her brand,

01:14:47.439 --> 01:14:50.616
for us, and for you,
the publishers.

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:52.531
Are you sure Rachel's
in line with this?

01:14:52.575 --> 01:14:56.013
Of course she is. It's been
her plan all along.

01:14:56.056 --> 01:14:57.928
Did you run this by
her events producer?

01:14:57.971 --> 01:15:00.539
After tomorrow Jack
will no longer be needed.

01:15:00.583 --> 01:15:03.063
Rachel will be back on the first flight to Los Angeles.

01:15:03.107 --> 01:15:04.804
She will have forgotten
all about him.

01:15:04.848 --> 01:15:07.024
This is business, Austin.

01:15:07.067 --> 01:15:10.375
Business always
comes first with Rachel.

01:15:10.418 --> 01:15:11.245
Yes.

01:15:16.555 --> 01:15:18.165
What's wrong?
Where are you going?

01:15:18.209 --> 01:15:19.558
I trusted you with so much.

01:15:19.602 --> 01:15:21.473
You know how hard
that is for me?

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:22.561
What're you-

01:15:22.605 --> 01:15:23.954
what?

01:15:23.997 --> 01:15:27.044
How much would you exploit
for a book sale, huh?

01:15:27.087 --> 01:15:29.089
You were just using the people
of this, using me,

01:15:29.133 --> 01:15:30.351
to get a better book deal?

01:15:30.395 --> 01:15:31.657
What're you talking about?

01:15:31.701 --> 01:15:32.571
Oh, you don't know?

01:15:32.615 --> 01:15:34.094
How about you go ask Stuart?

01:15:34.138 --> 01:15:35.400
I just heard him explaining
the whole thing to Austin.

01:15:35.443 --> 01:15:38.838
I can't believe I let
my guard down with you.

01:15:38.882 --> 01:15:41.275
Wait... Jack?

01:15:46.629 --> 01:15:49.719
I finally let myself get close
to someone.

01:15:49.762 --> 01:15:53.766
Now he wants nothing
to do with me.

01:15:53.810 --> 01:15:59.424
Well, he's going through
a lot right now.

01:15:59.467 --> 01:16:01.557
He's scared.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:05.082
Just like you.

01:16:05.125 --> 01:16:08.781
It means you care
about each other.

01:16:08.825 --> 01:16:12.959
Every day is a second chance.

01:16:13.003 --> 01:16:16.397
We have, what, 12 hours
'til the event?

01:16:20.663 --> 01:16:22.273
What're you doing?

01:16:22.316 --> 01:16:25.798
I am making things ok.

01:16:25.842 --> 01:16:28.409
With a little Christmas magic.

01:16:35.329 --> 01:16:36.635
Merry Christmas.

01:16:36.679 --> 01:16:38.245
Merry Christmas.

01:16:43.163 --> 01:16:45.035
[laughs]

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:51.084

01:16:51.128 --> 01:16:52.216
Hi, Suzie.

01:16:52.259 --> 01:16:53.217
I'm Bridget.

01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:54.131
Let me show you
to your seats.

01:16:54.174 --> 01:16:55.828
Great.

01:17:03.357 --> 01:17:04.968
All the new changes are set.

01:17:05.011 --> 01:17:06.752
I cannot thank you enough,
Paul.

01:17:06.796 --> 01:17:07.797

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.363
Oh, not yet.

01:17:09.407 --> 01:17:10.669
I gotta get back to the booth.

01:17:10.713 --> 01:17:11.627
Have a good show.

01:17:11.670 --> 01:17:13.106
Thanks.

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:16.893
Ok.

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:20.940
Rachel, what's going on?

01:17:20.984 --> 01:17:23.595
I've been trying to call you.

01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:26.032
What did you and Austin
talk about last night?

01:17:26.076 --> 01:17:30.515
Um... I- I sent him
a promo package

01:17:30.558 --> 01:17:32.430
showing how generous
you'd been in the community.

01:17:32.473 --> 01:17:34.475
I never asked you
to do any of that.

01:17:36.869 --> 01:17:38.131
Good to go?

01:17:38.175 --> 01:17:39.829
Yeah. Your headphones
are right there, bud.

01:17:43.484 --> 01:17:45.835
Is that what you were filming
from your phone, Stuart?

01:17:45.878 --> 01:17:48.707
Oh, sorry, that's uh...
just checking on Rachel's-

01:17:48.751 --> 01:17:50.535
No, no, no. Don't turn it off.

01:17:50.578 --> 01:17:52.189
Leave it on, please.

01:17:52.232 --> 01:17:53.451
Yeah, I wanted to make sure
that you got credit

01:17:53.494 --> 01:17:54.757
for all the charitable works
you've been doing.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:57.411
Isn't that what this has
been all about?

01:17:57.455 --> 01:17:59.457
Is that what you think?

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:02.590
And what did you say
about Jack?

01:18:02.634 --> 01:18:04.288
Nothing.

01:18:04.331 --> 01:18:05.811
Look, I think you should
concentrate on what-

01:18:05.855 --> 01:18:06.899
No, Stuart.

01:18:06.943 --> 01:18:08.553
I want you to answer me.

01:18:08.596 --> 01:18:10.816
What did you say about Jack?

01:18:12.775 --> 01:18:14.733
I may have said that
after this event

01:18:14.777 --> 01:18:17.040
we won't need him anymore.

01:18:17.083 --> 01:18:20.652
Because he's been a distraction
and frankly so is Joy.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:23.046
What does it say in chapter
13 in your book?

01:18:23.089 --> 01:18:24.700
Distractions mean disaster.

01:18:24.743 --> 01:18:26.353
I trusted you.

01:18:26.397 --> 01:18:28.573
As my friend.

01:18:28.616 --> 01:18:31.402
But I was wrong.

01:18:31.445 --> 01:18:32.751
I was wrong
about a lot of things.

01:18:32.795 --> 01:18:34.448
Rachel, I have always
had your back.

01:18:34.492 --> 01:18:39.192
Yeah, only when
it benefits you.

01:18:39.236 --> 01:18:41.194
I used to be the same way.

01:18:43.501 --> 01:18:48.680
I think that it's best if we go
our separate ways for a while.

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:51.117
Have a safe flight back
to LA.

01:19:04.348 --> 01:19:06.306

01:19:07.090 --> 01:19:09.832

I'm Rachel Kennedy!

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:45.258
[applause]

01:19:45.302 --> 01:19:47.217
Two weeks ago
I asked you

01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:49.436
to look at yourselves
in the mirror.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:52.788
I said in order to be happy

01:19:52.831 --> 01:19:55.312
you have to make yourself
happy first.

01:19:55.355 --> 01:20:00.317
But tonight I would like you to
do something different for me.

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:01.840
Look around.

01:20:01.884 --> 01:20:06.062
Look at the faces on your right and on your left.

01:20:06.105 --> 01:20:08.194
Those faces.

01:20:08.238 --> 01:20:11.676
Maybe it's time we started
putting them first.

01:20:11.719 --> 01:20:15.419
At Christmas, and throughout
the entire year,

01:20:15.462 --> 01:20:18.509
we all need a little help.

01:20:18.552 --> 01:20:23.209
We all need to be reminded
that we are not alone.

01:20:23.253 --> 01:20:27.692
[applause]

01:20:27.735 --> 01:20:32.958
It took a little Joy

01:20:36.135 --> 01:20:39.617
and a Jack of all trades

01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:44.187
to show me the true spirit
of Christmas.

01:20:44.230 --> 01:20:48.060
But I think that we should
all be living

01:20:48.104 --> 01:20:52.586
the true spirit of Christmas
all year 'round.

01:20:52.630 --> 01:20:57.548
And Christmas spirit
is about giving.

01:20:57.591 --> 01:21:00.768
Because someone once
reminded me

01:21:00.812 --> 01:21:04.860
that inspiration should never
be expensive,

01:21:04.903 --> 01:21:07.514
so all proceeds from
tonight's event,

01:21:07.558 --> 01:21:10.300
and a portion of book sales
will go directly

01:21:10.343 --> 01:21:12.780
to the Fall Oaks
Community Centre.

01:21:12.824 --> 01:21:20.658
[cheering and applause]

01:21:21.702 --> 01:21:25.445
But finally,
most important,

01:21:25.489 --> 01:21:30.320
Christmas spirit is about love.

I'm so sorry.

Hey. Christmas spirit
is about forgiveness.
