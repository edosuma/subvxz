00:43.552 --> 00:45.252
Good morning,
Mr. Draper.

00:45.287 --> 00:47.088
Morning.

00:47.122 --> 00:49.256
It's Beverly, isn't it?

00:49.291 --> 00:51.058
He's on 19.

00:51.093 --> 00:53.194
Thank you.

00:57.199 --> 00:58.631
Good morning.

00:58.665 --> 01:00.266
You don't have to
do this every day.

01:00.301 --> 01:02.202
I won't have you lost again.

01:02.236 --> 01:04.870
I wasn't lost. I was late.
I was fibbing.

01:04.905 --> 01:06.439
Well, you can't do that.

01:06.474 --> 01:08.741
It throws off
a very busy schedule.

01:08.775 --> 01:11.244
Not to mention
everything, et cetera.

01:11.278 --> 01:13.346
Can you call housekeeping
and ask them

01:13.380 --> 01:14.680
not to make up my bed
while I'm still in it?

01:14.715 --> 01:17.382
Well, you won't have
to endure the hardships

01:17.417 --> 01:18.950
of The Plaza much longer.

01:18.985 --> 01:21.420
The floors of your apartment
will be done Monday.

01:21.454 --> 01:23.888
If you pick paint, you
could move in next week.

01:23.923 --> 01:25.890
That's great.

01:28.561 --> 01:30.962
Honey, you can just have
this waiting on my desk.

01:30.997 --> 01:33.431
Does it smell
any better in here?

01:33.465 --> 01:35.433
If you like Airwick.

01:35.467 --> 01:37.268
Fruit.

01:37.302 --> 01:39.870
When I was packing,
well, I think these

01:39.904 --> 01:41.506
were best kept from the movers.

01:45.444 --> 01:47.211
<i>Have you thought about</i>
<i>new furniture?</i>

01:48.547 --> 01:50.079
I think it looks great in here.

01:50.114 --> 01:53.082
No, for your apartment.
You only have a bed.

01:53.117 --> 01:56.253
I made dinner reservations
in Farmington tomorrow.

01:56.287 --> 01:58.688
You're taking Sally
back to school.

01:58.722 --> 02:00.023
Oh, thank you.

02:00.057 --> 02:02.058
Jim Hobart's back
from vacation.

02:02.092 --> 02:04.093
No napping.

02:05.563 --> 02:07.496
<i>( door closes )</i>

02:12.769 --> 02:14.903

02:19.142 --> 02:21.277
<i>( whistling resumes )</i>

02:27.650 --> 02:29.784
You and the computer gonna
share an office over there?

02:29.818 --> 02:33.154
No, the old girl
served her purpose.

02:33.189 --> 02:35.156
McCann is Mission Control.

02:35.191 --> 02:36.991
Statisticians, programmers,

02:37.025 --> 02:39.760
five men and 10 women
just handling data.

02:39.795 --> 02:42.596
Maybe they can keep track of your hat size.
Seems to be growing.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.665
Why are you still here?

02:44.699 --> 02:47.000
Somebody's got to
hand over the keys.

02:47.034 --> 02:49.936
Well, I'm on 24
and you're on 26,

02:49.970 --> 02:51.371
but I'll be up there
all the time.

02:51.406 --> 02:53.574
There's an executive
dining room.

02:53.608 --> 02:57.110
You know, I once rode on a bus to
camp sitting next to a guy like you.

02:57.144 --> 02:59.512
We're not going
to be bunkmates, Crane.

02:59.546 --> 03:01.614
I'll make them build
another floor if I have to.

03:01.648 --> 03:03.583
I'm not going to let you
spoil the moment.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.050
My moment.

03:05.085 --> 03:07.186
See you in the funny papers.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.624
I don't know what's keeping
the building representatives,

03:11.658 --> 03:12.891
but I feel perfectly
comfortable--

03:12.926 --> 03:14.559
Forging my signature?

03:14.594 --> 03:16.261
No, that's okay.
You can go.

03:16.295 --> 03:19.631
Well, this is my last day
and I wanted to thank you.

03:19.665 --> 03:21.633
Bullshit.
They can't fire you.

03:21.667 --> 03:24.302
Actually, I took another job.

03:24.337 --> 03:27.038
Travelers Insurance.
My cousin works there.

03:27.072 --> 03:29.841
- Look, I hate Caroline, too.
- No, it's--

03:29.875 --> 03:31.908
- Did I do something?
- No.

03:31.943 --> 03:35.912
It's just I kept thinking about
walking into a new office.

03:35.947 --> 03:37.781
I'm doing it, too.

03:37.815 --> 03:39.650
And now there's going to be
one less person I know.

03:39.684 --> 03:42.085
Mr. Sterling,
it's not you.

03:42.120 --> 03:46.490
Advertising is not a very
comfortable place for everyone.

03:48.292 --> 03:49.492
Oh.

03:49.526 --> 03:52.662
That in mind,
I have to say thank you.

03:52.696 --> 03:55.097
You're very amusing.

03:56.333 --> 03:58.301
Fat lot of good it did me.

04:02.873 --> 04:05.340
- ( knocks )
- Hello, neighbor.

04:05.375 --> 04:08.477
We're the welcome wagon.
We heard you had a window.

04:08.511 --> 04:10.512
Aren't you sweet to come by?

04:10.546 --> 04:12.748
This is Beverly.
And who are you?

04:12.782 --> 04:15.584
- I'm Libby Blum.
- Karen Schmidt.

04:15.618 --> 04:17.685
Can we have a minute?

04:19.422 --> 04:21.690
- We're copywriters.
- I recognized the names.

04:21.724 --> 04:23.291
I was just going over Tampax.

04:23.325 --> 04:25.125
We also did the pill
for Ortho, and--

04:25.160 --> 04:27.728
If it's in it, near it, or makes
you think about it, we're on it.

04:27.763 --> 04:29.664
( chuckles )

04:29.698 --> 04:33.901
So Topaz Pantyhose and Butler
Shoes set off an alarm.

04:33.935 --> 04:36.103
But we really love Avon.

04:36.137 --> 04:38.138
This is incredible.

04:38.173 --> 04:41.608
So you just came in here
to get on my business.

04:41.642 --> 04:43.543
And to say hello.

04:43.577 --> 04:45.912
Well, I'm flattered by both.

04:45.946 --> 04:48.615
If you want us, just ask
Frank in the studio.

04:48.649 --> 04:50.183
He'll ask Bobby in traffic,

04:50.217 --> 04:52.251
and he'll tell Carl the
associate creative director.

04:52.286 --> 04:54.387
You can put a request in
however you want.

04:54.422 --> 04:56.255
We'll let the Soviets
deal with it.

04:56.290 --> 04:59.391
You're aware that Peggy Olson
handles all of those accounts?

05:00.960 --> 05:02.461
See, I told you.

05:02.495 --> 05:04.930
Well, we'd love to share
the crumbs with her.

05:06.165 --> 05:08.734
Thank you so much
for the plant.

05:08.768 --> 05:11.036
Oh, we're going to
the Oyster Bar tonight.

05:11.070 --> 05:13.205
We have an informal
ladies' club.

05:13.239 --> 05:15.172
It's not women's lib,
just a bitch session.

05:15.207 --> 05:17.842
We are strictly
consciousness lowering.

05:17.876 --> 05:20.044
( laughs )
When I get settled in.

05:31.789 --> 05:34.190
( sighs )

05:34.225 --> 05:35.759
Incredible.

05:35.793 --> 05:37.594
Did you come to get
your furniture?

05:37.628 --> 05:39.363
There was a mix-up.

05:39.397 --> 05:41.465
My office isn't ready.

05:41.499 --> 05:43.533
Why are you still here?

05:43.568 --> 05:45.068
Well, I'm not going to McCann.

05:45.102 --> 05:46.636
And so far I'm not
going anywhere.

05:46.671 --> 05:48.671
And I'm being paid through
the end of the week,

05:48.705 --> 05:50.406
so I thought I'd make some
long-distance phone calls.

05:50.440 --> 05:52.274
Oh.

05:55.879 --> 05:59.081
- We lost Dow.
- We still owe them work.

05:59.115 --> 06:01.116
Could you get Mr. Kreutzer
at Sugarberry Ham for me?

06:01.150 --> 06:02.518
Why would I do that?

06:02.552 --> 06:04.486
Because Marsha's sorting
things out over there

06:04.520 --> 06:06.954
and I'm not calling myself.

06:14.296 --> 06:16.631
I'm giving you
a standing ovation.

06:17.933 --> 06:19.133
How was the Bahamas?

06:19.167 --> 06:22.002
Oh, it's everything
we say it is in print.

06:26.307 --> 06:28.709
I hope you're finding
everything satisfactory.

06:28.743 --> 06:30.811
Ferg's been
an excellent tour guide.

06:30.845 --> 06:34.180
He's just following you around because
he's our resident impressionist.

06:34.215 --> 06:36.216
Do you do an imitation
of Don yet?

06:37.419 --> 06:39.886
"I'm, um, working
very diligently

06:39.920 --> 06:41.754
on the, um,
matter at hand."

06:41.789 --> 06:43.188
( laughs )

06:43.223 --> 06:45.525
Well, you better not
make a joke of this man.

06:45.559 --> 06:48.394
We've lined up coffee
and baloney with Nabisco,

06:48.429 --> 06:51.731
National Cash Register, and
your old friend Conrad Hilton.

06:51.765 --> 06:53.299
He bought you a gift.

06:53.333 --> 06:55.000
( chuckles )
That's never good.

06:55.035 --> 06:56.902
And we just bought
an entire agency

06:56.936 --> 06:58.737
in Milwaukee
to get Miller Beer.

06:58.771 --> 07:00.539
For me?

07:00.573 --> 07:02.741
When I want something,
I get it.

07:02.775 --> 07:05.310
And I've been trying
to get you for 10 years.

07:05.344 --> 07:07.145
You're my "white whale," Don.

07:07.179 --> 07:09.448
Well, maybe you should
send <i>me</i> to the Bahamas.

07:09.482 --> 07:11.783
In due time.
The important thing is

07:11.818 --> 07:14.618
we're expecting you to bring
things up a notch around here.

07:16.254 --> 07:18.756
Jim, I don't know what to tell you.
I'll do my best.

07:18.790 --> 07:21.459
And, Don, this is
a shirtsleeves operation.

07:21.493 --> 07:22.793
We want you relaxed.

07:22.828 --> 07:24.595
And should you ever need
anything in this city,

07:24.629 --> 07:26.330
dinner reservations,
parking tickets...

07:26.364 --> 07:29.299
Just drop our name into yours.

07:29.334 --> 07:31.434
I will.

07:35.973 --> 07:38.307
Oh, Miller Beer
is coming in tomorrow

07:38.342 --> 07:40.543
for handshakes
on their new idea--

07:40.578 --> 07:41.978
diet beer.

07:42.012 --> 07:43.680
For ladies?

07:43.714 --> 07:46.048
For men watching
their waistlines.

07:46.083 --> 07:47.583
Why don't we call it "Tub"?

07:47.617 --> 07:49.117
( laughs )

07:49.151 --> 07:51.887
- Have you said it yet?
- What?

07:51.921 --> 07:54.389
Have you introduced yourself?

07:56.960 --> 07:59.094
I'm Don Draper
from McCann-Erickson.

08:01.731 --> 08:02.931
( sighs )

08:06.468 --> 08:08.335
Barry:
<i>I appreciate the call.</i>

08:08.370 --> 08:10.170
<i>Mostly because it's hard</i>
<i>for me to walk around here</i>

08:10.205 --> 08:11.939
<i>acting like nothing's changed.</i>

08:11.974 --> 08:13.641
Only some things have changed.

08:13.675 --> 08:16.544
Avon will be serviced
by the exact same personnel.

08:16.578 --> 08:18.713
Creative handled by
Ted Chaough and Peggy Olson.

08:18.747 --> 08:21.414
Forget about personnel.
Every dollar you spend

08:21.448 --> 08:23.884
will now get you
five times the audience.

08:23.918 --> 08:26.085
And once we get you on TV...

08:26.120 --> 08:28.121
<i>Well, we already are on TV.</i>

08:28.155 --> 08:31.090
We know that.
What Dennis is saying is--

08:31.125 --> 08:32.859
You know, I'm in Atlanta
all the time.

08:32.894 --> 08:35.395
How about a trip to
Augusta, play a few holes?

08:35.429 --> 08:37.263
You any good?

08:37.297 --> 08:38.563
<i>No.</i>

08:40.332 --> 08:42.568
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

08:42.602 --> 08:46.471
<i>Listen, my girl is telling me that
it's time for our staff meeting.</i>

08:46.506 --> 08:48.106
<i>Thanks again for the call.</i>

08:48.141 --> 08:50.843
Of course.
Such a pleasure, Barry.

08:50.877 --> 08:52.878
Bye.

08:54.447 --> 08:57.081
- Who's next?
- I don't know what to say,

08:57.115 --> 08:59.116
except Barry
is in a wheelchair.

08:59.151 --> 09:01.686
- <i>What?</i>
- I told you that.

09:01.720 --> 09:03.655
And I wrote it down.

09:03.689 --> 09:06.624
Oh, I thought that
was Charlie Butler

09:06.659 --> 09:08.693
from the shoes.

09:08.727 --> 09:11.795
No, it's not.
And it's <i>Charles</i> Butler.

09:11.829 --> 09:13.664
And it's <i>footwear.</i>

09:13.698 --> 09:15.231
( sighs )
I can't believe you.

09:15.266 --> 09:16.800
It's an honest mistake.

09:16.834 --> 09:18.969
You heard him say he was
"walking around the office."

09:19.003 --> 09:20.571
It's an expression.

09:20.605 --> 09:23.139
Which he shouldn't
be able to use.

09:23.174 --> 09:25.609
I stayed up all night
preparing those briefs.

09:25.643 --> 09:28.911
Mr. Donnelly said you'd be on the
call to help with the transition.

09:28.946 --> 09:31.647
But you seem like you don't even
care about keeping these accounts.

09:33.283 --> 09:35.184
I'm sorry.

09:35.218 --> 09:38.253
Who told you you got
to get pissed off?

09:45.495 --> 09:48.897
All I ask is that you please read
the brief before our next call.

09:48.931 --> 09:51.365
You know what?

09:51.400 --> 09:53.434
Do it yourself.

09:54.637 --> 09:56.037
I thought you were
going to be fun.

10:03.377 --> 10:05.545
<i>( "McCloud" theme music playing )</i>

10:06.547 --> 10:08.582
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

10:14.022 --> 10:15.789
<i>( TV off )</i>

10:23.764 --> 10:25.564
I'm sorry to drop by.

10:25.599 --> 10:29.836
Oh, Marsha.
That's so sweet of you.

10:29.870 --> 10:32.872
You didn't have to come up here.
It's not your fault.

10:32.906 --> 10:34.874
Those are actually from McCann.

10:34.908 --> 10:37.308
An apology.
That's classy.

10:37.343 --> 10:39.244
How do I explain this?

10:39.278 --> 10:41.246
All the SC&P girls got flowers.

10:42.481 --> 10:43.682
It's still classy.

10:43.716 --> 10:46.184
Well, all the new secretaries.

10:47.386 --> 10:49.254
They thought I was a secretary?

10:50.422 --> 10:52.124
Did you tell Don what happened?

10:52.158 --> 10:54.025
- Do you want me to?
- No.

10:54.059 --> 10:56.293
Maybe I should call Joan.

10:56.327 --> 10:57.995
That's not her job there.

10:58.030 --> 11:00.931
- I know that, Marsha.
- I am taking care of it.

11:00.966 --> 11:03.134
As well as your mail
and memos regarding

11:03.168 --> 11:05.469
Peter Pan Peanut Butter
and Tampax.

11:05.503 --> 11:07.204
What happened to all my things?

11:07.238 --> 11:08.973
They're putting
your boxes in storage.

11:09.007 --> 11:10.407
You will have
an office any minute.

11:10.441 --> 11:12.776
In the meantime,
you can work in the pool.

11:12.810 --> 11:15.444
I am a copy supervisor.

11:15.479 --> 11:19.215
I am not setting foot in there
until I have an office.

11:19.249 --> 11:21.718
If they want me,
they can reach me here.

11:21.752 --> 11:23.920
At home?

11:25.322 --> 11:28.724
No. No.
I'll be at SC&P.

11:28.758 --> 11:30.793
Hell, that's where
my furniture is.

11:30.827 --> 11:32.394
I will let them know.

11:41.771 --> 11:44.106
Joan:
<i>Could you hold that?</i>

11:46.508 --> 11:48.910
Good morning.
How are you, stranger?

11:48.944 --> 11:51.278
Homesick.

11:53.448 --> 11:55.683
Well, takes some time
to settle in.

11:55.718 --> 11:57.518
I know.

11:57.552 --> 11:59.153
You should come by for a drink.

11:59.188 --> 12:01.988
When am I going to do that?

12:07.394 --> 12:08.862
Put me on your calendar.

12:08.896 --> 12:10.663
We don't share any accounts.

12:10.698 --> 12:12.032
You're too important.

12:12.066 --> 12:13.299
Not for you.

12:13.334 --> 12:14.868
Believe me,

12:14.902 --> 12:17.070
I'd involve you if I could.

12:17.105 --> 12:19.371
It's been a little bumpy.

12:19.405 --> 12:22.241
I can still interfere.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.543
No, I'll figure it out.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.846
Of that I am certain.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.814
<i>( elevator bell rings )</i>

12:30.483 --> 12:31.917
Let's make a date for lunch.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.786
Soon.

12:45.322 --> 12:47.290
Meredith: <i>Tell me if you
like the general idea</i>

12:47.324 --> 12:49.092
<i>so I can take a few risks.</i>

12:49.127 --> 12:50.393
Where did you learn to do this?

12:50.427 --> 12:52.162
I'm an army brat, remember?

12:52.196 --> 12:53.695
New base every year.

12:53.730 --> 12:56.398
( chuckles )
I want to live here.

12:56.432 --> 12:58.768
You're my decorator.
I'll pay you in cash.

12:58.802 --> 13:00.669
Nonsense.
I love it.

13:00.703 --> 13:03.873
Lunch in the executive
boardroom with Miller Beer.

13:03.907 --> 13:05.908
They asked if roast beef
was okay.

13:05.942 --> 13:07.977
Perfect.

13:10.146 --> 13:13.014
<i>( door closes )</i>

13:13.048 --> 13:16.017
Joan, it's nice
to see you up here.

13:16.051 --> 13:18.486
Are you coming to the Sears briefing?
That's a good idea.

13:18.520 --> 13:21.222
No, I was actually
looking for Mr. Donnelly.

13:21.257 --> 13:23.057
- But if now is a bad time--
- Ferg.

13:23.092 --> 13:25.827
Pete, it's your meeting.
You can start without me.

13:25.861 --> 13:28.595
I'm gonna put in a request to
get you involved with this.

13:28.629 --> 13:31.965
Thank you.
That's thoughtful.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.400
So what can I do for you?

13:33.434 --> 13:35.803
It's just--

13:35.837 --> 13:37.905
regarding the Avon transition,

13:37.939 --> 13:40.573
I thought maybe Pete
could be an asset.

13:40.608 --> 13:43.476
Pete's a vice president.
What's wrong with Dennis?

13:43.511 --> 13:45.411
I like Dennis personally.

13:45.445 --> 13:48.347
I'm not sure the client
responded to him.

13:48.381 --> 13:50.382
Say no more.

13:50.417 --> 13:52.185
I'll take care of it.

13:58.525 --> 14:00.892
<i>( lights buzzing )</i>

14:00.927 --> 14:02.627
Hello?

14:02.661 --> 14:06.464
<i>( Ed speaking Japanese )</i>

14:11.103 --> 14:12.670
Are those my boxes?

14:12.705 --> 14:16.574
I gotta go.
I gotta go.

14:16.608 --> 14:19.143
Yeah, I signed for them, but I
was wondering what happened.

14:19.177 --> 14:21.212
Ugh, you've got
to be kidding me.

14:21.246 --> 14:23.347
You know we're
the only ones here.

14:23.381 --> 14:25.216
Have you been on
the phone all morning?

14:25.250 --> 14:28.719
Stan called.
He doesn't have a phone yet.

14:28.753 --> 14:31.521
He's on the 14th floor.
Come by and say hi.

14:31.556 --> 14:32.890
And...

14:34.192 --> 14:35.892
I prepared this
for your approval.

14:39.163 --> 14:40.163
_

14:40.164 --> 14:43.132
- What is this?
- <i>Do you think "quagmire" should be plural?</i>

14:43.167 --> 14:45.501
We can't do this.

14:45.535 --> 14:47.737
They're never going
to look at it.

14:47.771 --> 14:50.974
Ed, you could easily end up
working for Dow again,

14:51.008 --> 14:52.507
or Ken Cosgrove.

14:52.541 --> 14:54.209
You could even end up
working for me.

14:57.513 --> 15:00.648
That's not very subtle.

15:00.683 --> 15:03.986
I asked you to do one damn thing
and you didn't even do it.

15:04.020 --> 15:06.421
Fine. I quit.

15:06.455 --> 15:07.990
( scoffs )

15:08.024 --> 15:09.891
( chuckles )

15:09.925 --> 15:14.228
Well, thanks for everything.

15:16.164 --> 15:20.034
When you get settled in over
there, which will happen,

15:20.068 --> 15:21.903
give me a call?

15:21.937 --> 15:24.105
I promise.

15:39.253 --> 15:41.321
( men chatting )

15:43.623 --> 15:45.791
I'm sorry.
It's Bob, right?

15:45.825 --> 15:47.492
Yes. Don,
good to see you.

15:47.527 --> 15:49.328
We've got the best
box lunch around.

15:49.362 --> 15:51.297
It should have your name on it.

15:51.331 --> 15:52.764
Is this the Miller
Beer meeting?

15:52.799 --> 15:55.935
It certainly is. Bill
Phillips, Conley Research.

15:55.969 --> 15:58.037
Don Draper and Ted Chaough.

15:58.071 --> 16:00.271
- A pleasure.
- Bob: Shall we?

16:02.174 --> 16:04.175
Is this every creative
director in the agency?

16:04.209 --> 16:06.177
It's only half of us.

16:08.347 --> 16:11.182
So are you here to
"bring us up a notch," too?

16:11.216 --> 16:12.750
( laughs )
So they tell me.

16:18.089 --> 16:20.490
Bob:
Good morning, gentlemen.

16:20.524 --> 16:22.459
As you know this
is Bill Phillips,

16:22.493 --> 16:25.095
Senior Director
at Conley Research.

16:25.129 --> 16:29.032
Bill, why don't you tell us a little
bit about this exciting new beverage?

16:30.768 --> 16:34.170
Despite that pile of facts
and figures in front of you,

16:34.204 --> 16:36.872
I don't look at this as
a presentation of research.

16:36.906 --> 16:40.076
To me, this is
an opportunity to stimulate

16:40.110 --> 16:42.845
some of our industry's
finest imaginations.

16:44.114 --> 16:46.015
<i>I'm going to describe</i>
<i>a man to you</i>

16:46.049 --> 16:48.351
of very specific qualities.

16:48.385 --> 16:51.386
He lives in Wisconsin,

16:51.420 --> 16:54.655
Michigan, Ohio.

16:54.690 --> 16:56.724
Some call it
"the Heartland."

16:56.758 --> 16:59.227
Some call it
"the Beer Belt."

16:59.261 --> 17:01.629
He has some college.

17:01.663 --> 17:04.031
<i>Makes a good living,</i>

17:04.066 --> 17:07.702
<i>but it doesn't feel like it</i>
<i>because he works long hours.</i>

17:07.736 --> 17:11.204
He has a lawn mower.

17:11.239 --> 17:13.473
<i>Wants a hammock.</i>

17:13.508 --> 17:17.444
<i>Bunch of power tools in the
garage that he never uses.</i>

17:17.479 --> 17:20.146
He loves sports because
he used to play 'em.

17:20.181 --> 17:23.583
And he loves dogs
because they don't talk.

17:23.617 --> 17:25.917
( laughing )

17:25.952 --> 17:28.320
We all know this man.

17:28.355 --> 17:31.190
Because there are
millions of him.

17:31.225 --> 17:33.493
<i>And he drinks beer.</i>

17:33.527 --> 17:35.428
<i>Not just any beer.</i>

17:35.462 --> 17:38.097
<i>No, it has to be his brand.</i>

17:38.132 --> 17:41.534
<i>And what is his brand?</i>

17:41.568 --> 17:43.701
<i>The one he drank in college?</i>

17:43.736 --> 17:45.803
<i>The one his dad drank?</i>

17:45.838 --> 17:49.107
<i>The one that comes in</i>
<i>the best bottle, can, tap?</i>

17:50.476 --> 17:52.710
<i>It doesn't matter</i>
<i>because that's it</i>

17:52.745 --> 17:55.547
<i>and it's not open</i>
<i>for discussion.</i>

17:55.581 --> 17:58.183
<i>Now you all know</i>
<i>that that's not true.</i>

17:58.217 --> 18:00.751
<i>But how do you get him</i>
<i>to open his mind?</i>

18:00.785 --> 18:03.120
<i>Better have something more.</i>

18:03.155 --> 18:06.323
<i>Or in this case, less.</i>

18:06.358 --> 18:08.292
And that's tricky.

18:08.326 --> 18:12.063
When we talk about
a low-calorie beer,

18:12.097 --> 18:14.432
we immediately become feminine.

18:14.466 --> 18:17.067
It's the word
"calorie."

18:17.101 --> 18:19.569
<i>It makes you think</i>
<i>of a reducing plan.</i>

18:19.603 --> 18:22.905
<i>A note on the fridge</i>
<i>to remind her about her diet.</i>

18:25.176 --> 18:27.210
( knocks )

18:27.244 --> 18:28.578
Your girl still at lunch?

18:28.612 --> 18:31.081
Beverly always takes the whole hour.
I insist.

18:34.784 --> 18:36.251
I have a little news for you.

18:36.286 --> 18:38.187
Oh, I hope I didn't
'cause any trouble.

18:38.221 --> 18:39.854
Too early for you?

18:39.889 --> 18:41.957
No, of course not.

18:45.361 --> 18:48.263
So, I spoke with Dennis.

18:48.298 --> 18:50.298
I hope I didn't
ruffle any feathers.

18:52.901 --> 18:55.536
Well, here's how it looks.

18:55.571 --> 18:57.871
Like some junior
account man came in

18:57.906 --> 18:59.407
and started
swinging her elbows.

18:59.441 --> 19:02.610
He didn't read the brief.
And I'm not Dennis's junior.

19:02.644 --> 19:05.113
Joan, see it from his side.

19:05.147 --> 19:06.880
He has a wife
and three children.

19:06.915 --> 19:08.648
He's not going
to work for a <i>girl.</i>

19:08.682 --> 19:10.250
What's he gonna say
to a client?

19:10.284 --> 19:12.252
"She's my boss"?

19:12.286 --> 19:14.921
It happens all the time now.

19:14.955 --> 19:17.491
Peggy Olson was our copy chief.

19:17.525 --> 19:20.494
It's different with a bunch of
writers fresh out of Columbia.

19:20.528 --> 19:23.196
And honestly, I doubt that's
gonna continue here anyway.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.298
I see.

19:26.333 --> 19:30.035
Joan, I didn't come
down here to upset you.

19:30.069 --> 19:32.104
I agree that the best way
to keep the business

19:32.139 --> 19:34.140
is to keep your status
on your accounts.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.774
Oh.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.709
And you'll certainly get
the respect you desire,

19:37.744 --> 19:39.378
now it's just you and me.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.913
You don't have to do that,
but I accept.

19:42.948 --> 19:45.950
( laughs )

19:45.984 --> 19:48.253
Mm, good.

19:48.287 --> 19:50.688
Now, first thing we have to
do is pay this guy a visit.

19:50.722 --> 19:52.990
- Who?
- Barry from Avon.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.626
We owe him an apology.

19:54.660 --> 19:56.794
And let's face it, it would
be good to get out of town,

19:56.828 --> 19:58.262
even if it's to Atlanta.

19:58.296 --> 20:00.930
I appreciate that, but I
don't want to put you out.

20:00.965 --> 20:05.502
Look, I know a good job
when I see one.

20:07.972 --> 20:10.907
No, it's just
that might be too much.

20:10.941 --> 20:12.609
He'll be in New York soon

20:12.644 --> 20:14.811
and Avon corporate
is blocks away.

20:14.845 --> 20:16.812
Hey, I'm easy.

20:16.846 --> 20:18.681
I'm not expecting anything
more than a good time.

20:18.715 --> 20:21.284
Excuse me?

20:21.318 --> 20:24.387
I mean, I want to get
to know you, of course.

20:24.421 --> 20:27.390
Of course.

20:27.424 --> 20:29.325
Good.

20:29.359 --> 20:31.026
For my first act
of benevolence,

20:31.061 --> 20:32.494
you can call Charles
Butler on your own.

20:32.528 --> 20:33.861
We'll take him
to lunch next week.

20:33.896 --> 20:35.863
Thank you.

20:37.800 --> 20:41.570
From now on, no one comes
between me and your business.

20:41.604 --> 20:43.905
I appreciate that.

20:48.511 --> 20:49.943
We can't lose those accounts.

20:49.977 --> 20:52.079
What would you do around here?

20:59.280 --> 21:01.514
<i>( doorbell rings )</i>

21:02.516 --> 21:04.583
Loretta.

21:08.854 --> 21:10.755
Here she is.

21:12.792 --> 21:14.759
- Sally left?
- Yes.

21:14.794 --> 21:16.461
She got a ride with her friend.

21:16.495 --> 21:18.797
And no one thought
to call me, I guess.

21:18.831 --> 21:20.399
Do you want something to drink?

21:20.433 --> 21:22.934
- No.
- They left after lunch.

21:22.968 --> 21:24.902
I told her to call your office.

21:24.937 --> 21:26.804
Your secretary is a moron.

21:26.838 --> 21:29.506
I was out of the office. I
wanted to get the car washed.

21:29.541 --> 21:32.009
She comes and goes
as she pleases.

21:32.044 --> 21:34.211
We can't get mad at her
for being independent.

21:34.246 --> 21:35.846
It's normal.

21:37.215 --> 21:39.483
- That what Freud says?
- ( chuckles )

21:39.517 --> 21:43.086
So far I haven't come
across anyone normal.

21:46.390 --> 21:47.790
You okay?

21:47.825 --> 21:51.361
I carried $100 worth
of textbooks yesterday

21:51.395 --> 21:53.129
during registration.

21:57.100 --> 21:59.168
- Maybe you're getting old.
- ( laughs )

21:59.202 --> 22:02.104
- I'm younger than you.
- Mm-hmm.

22:02.138 --> 22:04.406
Always have been,
always will be.

22:06.142 --> 22:09.178
Maybe you could find some nice
freshman to carry your books.

22:11.348 --> 22:13.382
That's fine.

22:18.487 --> 22:20.989
When do the boys get home?

22:21.023 --> 22:23.824
Gene's at Cub Scouts

22:23.859 --> 22:25.460
and Bobby's got baseball.

22:25.494 --> 22:27.661
They won't be back
until 6:30.

22:33.534 --> 22:35.335
I'll let you get back
to your studies.

22:35.370 --> 22:37.971
I've always wanted to do this.

22:39.773 --> 22:41.741
Knock 'em dead, Birdie.

22:43.478 --> 22:45.512
Bye.

23:01.828 --> 23:04.730
( winces )

23:04.764 --> 23:06.797
Shit.

23:30.121 --> 23:32.622
<i>( signal clicking )</i>

23:41.165 --> 23:43.132
Your stomach is grumbling.

23:43.167 --> 23:45.601
You never let me eat.

23:45.635 --> 23:47.703
I can make fried chicken.

23:49.073 --> 23:50.440
I don't mind playing house,

23:50.474 --> 23:52.108
but as long as your mother
and Kevin are away,

23:52.142 --> 23:54.243
why don't you call in sick?

23:54.278 --> 23:56.445
Let me take you to Bermuda.

23:56.479 --> 23:57.979
No.

23:59.415 --> 24:00.815
Cape Cod?

24:00.849 --> 24:02.917
I don't want to go anywhere
I don't want to go.

24:02.952 --> 24:05.053
Don't make plans for me.

24:05.088 --> 24:07.622
All right.
All right.

24:09.959 --> 24:12.360
I have a lot of work.

24:14.196 --> 24:16.397
Look, I know I told you
not to complain,

24:16.431 --> 24:18.999
but that doesn't mean I don't
want to hear about it.

24:21.636 --> 24:24.037
But you really don't.

24:25.039 --> 24:27.374
- What happened?
- ( sighs )

24:28.810 --> 24:32.245
It's a big place and I asked
the wrong person for help.

24:33.280 --> 24:35.715
And I don't think
I can get out of it.

24:35.749 --> 24:39.119
Well, if you don't like that
job, you don't have to do it.

24:41.422 --> 24:43.289
You got enough and you got me.

24:43.324 --> 24:45.858
They still owe me
over half a million dollars.

24:45.892 --> 24:47.526
I'm not walking away from that.

24:47.560 --> 24:50.028
So this is a business problem.

24:50.062 --> 24:52.664
Now I can help.

24:56.736 --> 24:58.303
You're already helping.

24:58.338 --> 25:01.840
There's two ways I deal
with disagreeable people.

25:01.874 --> 25:04.542
One, you can call a lawyer,

25:04.576 --> 25:07.044
throw a bunch of paper at them,

25:07.078 --> 25:10.148
tie them up in court,
cost them some money.

25:10.182 --> 25:12.750
Nobody wins,

25:12.784 --> 25:14.952
but it loosens the earth.

25:14.986 --> 25:17.054
What's the second?

25:17.088 --> 25:19.423
You can call a guy.

25:19.458 --> 25:21.391
"A guy"?

25:21.425 --> 25:24.161
I'm a developer.
Men get stubborn.

25:24.195 --> 25:26.829
What does "a guy" do?

25:26.864 --> 25:30.099
You get the right guy, all
they have to do is show up.

25:31.869 --> 25:33.537
You've really done that?

25:33.571 --> 25:36.839
You seem to like it,
so I'm gonna say yes.

25:38.542 --> 25:41.076
You're disturbed.

25:41.110 --> 25:44.012
Doesn't seem like such
a big problem now, does it?

I have a heart

28:55.060 --> 28:57.562
Believe it or not,
I'm not scary.

28:57.596 --> 29:00.264
Organ music is scary.
What are you doing here?

29:00.298 --> 29:02.799
I told Caroline I wanted
to pack my personal things,

29:02.834 --> 29:04.901
which I will eventually do

29:04.935 --> 29:07.036
as soon as I figure out why she
thought my bar wasn't personal.

29:07.071 --> 29:09.105
Did you try Don's office?

29:09.139 --> 29:10.874
All I found was lighter fluid.

29:10.908 --> 29:12.141
I'm not there yet.

29:12.176 --> 29:13.844
Mine's gone.

29:13.878 --> 29:17.180
I don't want to go to a bar.
I did that yesterday.

29:17.214 --> 29:19.448
Listen, sweetheart,
if you don't mind...

29:19.483 --> 29:22.251
I'm not running an errand.
I have to go to McCann.

29:22.285 --> 29:24.152
Three days ago.

29:24.187 --> 29:26.722
They screwed up
my office--

29:26.757 --> 29:29.392
It doesn't matter.
They're finally ready.

29:29.426 --> 29:31.594
I'd do it for you.

29:31.628 --> 29:33.429
Would you drink vermouth?

29:35.064 --> 29:37.298
Yes, I'm afraid I would.

29:42.813 --> 29:45.487
_

29:51.781 --> 29:53.347
I'll be along in a minute.

29:53.382 --> 29:56.016
Oh, Mr. Hobart.
Can I help you?

29:56.050 --> 29:57.684
You're sitting in his chair.

29:57.719 --> 29:59.286
You're obviously
not expecting him.

29:59.320 --> 30:01.688
I told Daphne I don't
know when he'll be in.

30:01.723 --> 30:03.089
Can I take a message?

30:03.124 --> 30:05.025
Sure.

30:05.059 --> 30:08.361
Tell him he missed Nabisco
and National Cash Register just left,

30:08.396 --> 30:10.297
so he might as well take
the rest of the day off.

30:10.331 --> 30:13.365
Thank you.
I'll let him know.

30:16.637 --> 30:18.604
Is he on a bender, sweetheart?

30:18.639 --> 30:20.372
I haven't heard from him,

30:20.407 --> 30:22.141
but he went to take
his daughter to school.

30:22.175 --> 30:23.810
I'm not concerned.

30:47.023 --> 30:50.059
Look at this.
"Christmas Day, 1951."

30:51.294 --> 30:54.663
- Who's Roberta?
- I don't know.

30:55.899 --> 30:57.933
Oh.
( chuckles )

30:57.968 --> 31:00.168
Roberta.

31:00.203 --> 31:01.836
Hmm.

31:01.870 --> 31:03.972
We had our drink.

31:04.006 --> 31:07.374
You clearly don't need help.
You need an audience.

31:07.409 --> 31:10.078
McCann made you wait.
You can make them wait.

31:10.112 --> 31:12.580
I'm not enjoying this.

31:17.885 --> 31:20.587
Oh, my God.
What is this?

31:20.622 --> 31:22.789
It's an octopus
pleasuring a lady.

31:24.125 --> 31:25.458
It was Cooper's.

31:25.493 --> 31:28.028
It was in his office forever.
You can have it.

31:28.062 --> 31:29.429
You can put it in <i>your</i> office.

31:29.463 --> 31:32.365
No. They won't
take me seriously.

31:32.399 --> 31:35.167
That's pretty serious.
It's 150 years old.

31:35.201 --> 31:38.337
You know I need to make
men feel at ease.

31:38.371 --> 31:40.039
Who told you that?

31:40.073 --> 31:41.540
So now I gave you something,

31:41.574 --> 31:43.575
you can sit tight
and keep me company.

31:46.546 --> 31:49.148
You think you're gonna have
fun like this over there?

31:51.284 --> 31:54.019
This is more attention than
I've ever gotten from you.

31:54.053 --> 31:56.621
You should see the floor I'm on.
It's a nursing home.

31:56.656 --> 31:59.557
What the hell happened?

31:59.591 --> 32:02.093
You're acting like you
had nothing to do with this.

32:02.128 --> 32:04.796
I'll have you know,
I held this place together.

32:04.830 --> 32:08.399
I know you think that,
but you actually sold it.

32:08.433 --> 32:10.968
You were supposed
to watch out for us.

32:11.002 --> 32:14.471
This business
doesn't have feelings.

32:14.505 --> 32:17.041
You get bought, you get
sold, you get fired.

32:17.075 --> 32:20.310
If the account moves, you move.

32:20.344 --> 32:22.012
Even if your name's
on the damn door,

32:22.047 --> 32:25.615
you should know better than to
get attached to some walls.

32:27.284 --> 32:30.119
Well, hopefully I'll have
that problem someday.

32:32.022 --> 32:33.890
Okay, hot stuff.

32:36.093 --> 32:38.061
It's exciting.

32:38.095 --> 32:41.430
I mean, I know it's going
to be challenging,

32:41.464 --> 32:45.767
but I needed that.
So do you.

32:48.571 --> 32:51.306
In the summer of '44,
it was over 100 degrees

32:51.340 --> 32:53.141
every day in the Pacific.

32:53.176 --> 32:56.211
So we dropped anchor in the
Ulithi Lagoon to go for a swim.

32:56.245 --> 32:58.413
And you can imagine
the men--

32:58.447 --> 33:00.981
it was bedlam.

33:01.016 --> 33:04.284
But...
I couldn't do it.

33:06.188 --> 33:07.321
Can't you swim?

33:07.355 --> 33:09.456
Did I mention
I was in the navy?

33:09.490 --> 33:13.293
No, the real problem was it was a
two-story drop off our cruiser.

33:14.696 --> 33:16.530
We all have regrets.

33:16.564 --> 33:19.665
No, I did it.

33:19.700 --> 33:21.367
I just needed a push.

33:26.540 --> 33:28.908
This was a hell
of a boat, you know?

33:30.811 --> 33:33.279
Come on.

33:39.685 --> 33:41.787
It just looks good now,

33:41.821 --> 33:45.257
but it was miserable when
you were in it. Trust me.

33:45.291 --> 33:47.692
Is that really how you're
gonna remember this place?

33:47.727 --> 33:49.728
( sighs )

33:49.763 --> 33:52.163
No.

33:52.197 --> 33:54.465
Good.

33:59.337 --> 34:01.405
This is the one
for the road, okay?

34:01.439 --> 34:03.641
You gonna show up drunk

34:03.675 --> 34:05.943
at 4:00
on your first day?

34:05.978 --> 34:08.110

Not yet. My husband will

34:31.234 --> 34:34.270
Well, I really just need
to talk to you.

34:34.304 --> 34:37.639
I'm Bill Phillips

We represent an array

And out of over 900 entries,

34:45.514 --> 34:47.648
you, Diana Baur,
were chosen to win

34:47.683 --> 34:51.252
a brand-new Westinghouse
refrigerator full of Miller Beer.

34:51.286 --> 34:53.654
- Oh.

34:53.688 --> 34:57.125
Now, you have your choice,
white or harvest gold.

34:57.159 --> 34:59.726
That's the fridge,
not the beer, of course.

34:59.760 --> 35:02.963
Well, that sounds wonderful,

35:02.997 --> 35:06.033
but I'm not Diana, I'm Laura.

35:06.067 --> 35:07.767
Can I still accept it?

35:07.802 --> 35:09.669
I don't know.

35:09.704 --> 35:12.472
I'm supposed to speak to Diana.

35:12.506 --> 35:14.274
Is your mother home?

35:17.010 --> 35:19.712
You really should
speak to my husband.

35:19.746 --> 35:22.281
She's his ex-wife.

35:22.316 --> 35:25.718
I guess if he knows where
she is, I could come back.

35:25.752 --> 35:28.888
Or wait in the car.

35:30.224 --> 35:32.225
My neighbors have seen you

35:43.970 --> 35:45.904
- I don't want to be a bother.
- It's no bother.

Are you looking for my mother?

36:06.224 --> 36:08.358
Diana is your mother?

36:08.392 --> 36:11.294
If she won something,
I should get it.

36:13.730 --> 36:16.900
Yes, that makes sense.

36:42.391 --> 36:45.793

that my accounts

<i>Our</i> accounts.

36:51.433 --> 36:53.234

36:56.271 --> 36:59.505
But as a partner at SC&P,

36:59.540 --> 37:01.975
I had a certain amount
of status.

37:02.009 --> 37:04.144
You know, more independence.

37:04.178 --> 37:07.480
What's the problem?
You can speak freely.

37:07.514 --> 37:10.716
Well, I don't think that Ferg
Donnelly is a good match.

37:12.386 --> 37:14.421
Ferg's very
important around here.

37:14.455 --> 37:17.689
Frankly, you're lucky he's taken
an interest in your business.

37:17.723 --> 37:20.225
I understand that,
but it's not necessary.

37:20.260 --> 37:22.494
I don't mean to brag, but I've
been handling this account

37:22.528 --> 37:24.163
on my own
since I brought it in.

37:24.197 --> 37:26.198
I'm sure that's true.

37:26.232 --> 37:30.102
But you're gonna have to get used
to doing things the way we do them.

37:30.136 --> 37:32.603
Well, I don't know
how to say this,

37:32.637 --> 37:34.738
but I can't work with him.

37:36.442 --> 37:38.242
Joan, it may not have sunk in,

37:38.277 --> 37:41.245
but your <i>status</i> has changed.

37:41.280 --> 37:45.016
Avon, Butler Footwear,
Topaz Pantyhose--

37:45.050 --> 37:46.750
I guess you don't need
those accounts.

37:46.785 --> 37:48.853
( sighs )

37:48.887 --> 37:50.920
I've tried to be patient,

37:50.955 --> 37:55.258
but I don't care about
your SC&P partnership.

37:55.293 --> 37:57.961
I don't know if somebody left
it to you in their will,

37:57.996 --> 38:00.630
but your little stake
doesn't mean anything here.

38:00.664 --> 38:03.266
Is that what you want?

38:03.301 --> 38:05.635
Because I'm perfectly happy

38:05.669 --> 38:08.504
to take my half a million
dollars and be on my way.

38:10.107 --> 38:12.475
I'll bet people always say
you're the kind of gal

38:12.509 --> 38:15.711
who doesn't take no
for an answer.

38:15.745 --> 38:19.882
But no, you're not telling
me how to run my business.

38:19.916 --> 38:22.951
Now find a way to get along

38:22.986 --> 38:25.520
or you can expect
a letter from our lawyer.

38:25.554 --> 38:29.790
I wonder how many women around here
would like to speak to a lawyer.

38:31.660 --> 38:35.763
I think the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission has one.

38:37.266 --> 38:39.800
Women love it here.

38:39.835 --> 38:43.737
You want to threaten us?
You'll be all alone.

38:43.771 --> 38:45.239
No.

38:45.273 --> 38:47.707
I think the second
I file a complaint,

38:47.742 --> 38:50.244
I'll have the ACLU in my office

38:50.278 --> 38:51.978
and Betty Friedan in the lobby

38:52.013 --> 38:54.481
with half the women
who marched down Fifth Avenue.

38:54.516 --> 38:57.583
I guess you didn't see the headlines about
what happened at "Ladies' Home Journal."

38:57.617 --> 38:59.818
Or "Newsweek."

38:59.853 --> 39:02.355
Do you have any idea
how much space

39:02.389 --> 39:04.757
McCann buys in "The New
York Times" every year?

39:04.791 --> 39:08.261
We could get them to print "Mein
Kampf" on the front page.

39:08.295 --> 39:11.230
Yes, I'm sure I'll find it
difficult to find a reporter

39:11.265 --> 39:13.466
who wants to embarrass
you this deeply.

39:19.972 --> 39:23.341
Look, you're unhappy.

39:23.376 --> 39:25.544
And now I'm unhappy.

39:25.578 --> 39:27.679
So how about this--

39:27.713 --> 39:30.148
I'm willing to give you
50 cents on the dollar

39:30.183 --> 39:32.583
to never see your face again.

39:32.617 --> 39:35.453
I guess I wasn't clear.

39:35.487 --> 39:38.355
I'm not negotiating.

39:41.259 --> 39:44.395
Then you should get out
of my office immediately.

39:50.834 --> 39:53.169
Go ahead.

39:53.204 --> 39:56.473
I'd rather give it to a lawyer.

40:03.747 --> 40:06.081
<i>( door closes )</i>

40:10.153 --> 40:11.520
So you get to drive
all over America

40:11.554 --> 40:12.754
giving people prizes?

40:12.789 --> 40:14.957
That sounds like fun.

40:14.992 --> 40:17.460
Well, I also give a lot
of boring presentations.

40:17.494 --> 40:20.096
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

40:20.130 --> 40:21.864
- Hello.
- Hello, honey.

40:21.898 --> 40:24.833
This is Bill Phillips.

40:24.868 --> 40:27.902
He says Diana won
some kind of prize.

40:27.936 --> 40:30.138
A refrigerator
full of Miller Beer.

40:31.607 --> 40:32.907
Really?

40:32.941 --> 40:36.211
Well, there's been
some confusion

40:36.245 --> 40:39.780
because a Mrs. Diana Baur
entered our contest

40:39.815 --> 40:42.083
and, well, she's
nowhere to be found.

40:42.118 --> 40:44.918
Diana never entered
any contest.

40:44.952 --> 40:47.321
Well, I guess it's a mistake.

40:47.355 --> 40:50.690
Yeah, letting you in our house.

40:50.725 --> 40:53.027
And my wife, she doesn't
know any better,

40:53.061 --> 40:55.295
- but I guess you knew that.
- Cliff, please.

40:55.330 --> 40:56.897
Let him answer.

40:58.966 --> 41:00.967
Who the heck are you?

41:01.002 --> 41:02.902
Or do I have to call
the police?

41:05.672 --> 41:08.508
( sighs )

41:08.542 --> 41:10.543
You're right.

41:10.577 --> 41:13.879
I'm deeply sorry
for the ruse, ma'am.

41:13.914 --> 41:15.915
But I work for
a collection agency.

41:17.317 --> 41:19.751
Clearly you're not responsible
for Mrs. Baur anymore,

41:19.785 --> 41:22.987
but I need to know
her whereabouts.

41:25.891 --> 41:28.160
Last I heard,
she was in New York.

41:28.194 --> 41:30.895
- Do you have an address?
- No.

41:30.930 --> 41:33.731
That's all I got.

41:35.034 --> 41:36.667
I apologize for the intrusion.

41:47.179 --> 41:49.180
Guess we're not as dumb
as you think we are.

41:49.214 --> 41:52.015
- I'm leaving.
- The clothes, the shoes, the Caddy?

41:52.050 --> 41:55.851
- You're no collection agent.
- I am.

41:55.886 --> 41:58.121
You think you're the first one
that came looking for her?

41:58.155 --> 42:00.022
She's a tornado

42:00.057 --> 42:02.492
just leaving a trail of
broken bodies behind her.

42:06.197 --> 42:08.198
I didn't mean to disturb you.

42:08.232 --> 42:10.732
Yeah, but you did.

42:10.766 --> 42:13.202
I am just starting
to get back on my feet.

42:13.236 --> 42:16.538
Just starting to get back to even
part of the way to where I was.

42:16.573 --> 42:18.940
Look, I'm sorry.

42:18.975 --> 42:21.176
I was worried about her.

42:24.247 --> 42:26.680
She seemed so lost.

42:26.715 --> 42:29.317
Well, I lost my daughter to God

42:29.351 --> 42:30.751
and my wife to the devil.

42:30.785 --> 42:32.753
I lost everything.

42:32.787 --> 42:34.322
That what you wanted to know?

42:34.356 --> 42:36.957
No.

42:36.992 --> 42:40.428
You can't save her.

42:40.462 --> 42:42.830
Only Jesus can.

42:42.864 --> 42:44.664
He'll help you, too.

42:44.698 --> 42:46.166
Ask Him.

42:46.200 --> 42:49.669
- Look, I--
- And don't come back.

42:53.941 --> 42:56.709

43:41.419 --> 43:43.520
Are any of you
planning to work here,

43:43.555 --> 43:45.522
or is this the con
of the century?

43:45.557 --> 43:48.225
Look, calm down.
We're all just settling in.

43:48.259 --> 43:50.327
Calm down?
Where the hell is Don?

43:50.361 --> 43:52.761
He walked out of a meeting
Wednesday and hasn't come back.

43:52.796 --> 43:54.630
He does that.

43:54.665 --> 43:58.133
Well, you may have
sold me a rotten apple,

43:58.168 --> 44:00.469
but it's not too late
to let the ax fly.

44:00.504 --> 44:02.104
Starting with that redhead.

44:02.138 --> 44:03.306
Joan?

44:03.340 --> 44:06.942
I don't want to hear
her name again.

44:06.976 --> 44:09.444
<i>( music playing )</i>

Jim Hobart's not afraid of you.

44:50.150 --> 44:51.584
Then why'd he send you?

44:51.619 --> 44:53.185
To tell you I can't help you.

44:53.220 --> 44:55.688
Well, thank you very much.

44:55.723 --> 44:57.423
Listen to me.

You're not going to do better
than 50 cents on the dollar.

44:59.825 --> 45:01.460
It's not about the money.

45:01.494 --> 45:03.061
It's only about the money.

45:03.095 --> 45:04.696
Don't hide behind politics.

45:04.731 --> 45:06.798
Take the money
and be done with them.

45:06.832 --> 45:08.933
Take half my money?

45:08.968 --> 45:12.504
I know it's all my fault and
I'm trying to take care of it.

45:12.538 --> 45:14.573
You've started something that
could leave you with nothing.

45:16.408 --> 45:17.908
It's plenty.
