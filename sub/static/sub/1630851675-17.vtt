00:01.485 --> 00:03.669
Al housewives
of potomac"...

00:03.704 --> 00:05.654
[cheering, laughing]

00:05.690 --> 00:07.856
[screaming]

00:07.908 --> 00:09.474
- oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

00:09.493 --> 00:11.860
- You wanna talk about
your fiery box is on fire,

00:11.912 --> 00:13.662
and that's why
you can't keep a man?

00:13.698 --> 00:15.681
She has a hotbox.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.249
- Hell yeah!
- Up in the air!

00:18.953 --> 00:20.419
- Why you look
so good, girl?

00:20.454 --> 00:22.921
- I'm getting ready to say,
"I do," again.

00:22.957 --> 00:24.323
Oh, lord, okay.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.959
25 years, yes,
it's an institution.

00:26.994 --> 00:29.044
Some people ain't even
together for 25 seconds.

00:29.096 --> 00:30.829
Some people can't get the man
out of the phone.

00:30.848 --> 00:33.682
- I need two clips,
so we can send to e-one.

00:33.718 --> 00:35.384
- Like, I need to sign
yesterday.

00:35.436 --> 00:39.021
Finding the right label
that has some cred

00:39.056 --> 00:41.240
could be literally
a dream come true.

00:41.275 --> 00:43.892
- Like, it's hard to, like,
look up to you or dad

00:43.944 --> 00:45.577
because, like,
we don't see you,

00:45.613 --> 00:47.713
like, in relationships.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.515
- Wow, this is, like,
worse than I thought.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.703
- Robyn, can you imagine
you with a little girl?

00:54.739 --> 00:56.321
- I know.
She would be cute.

00:58.059 --> 01:00.242
- Hi, honey, we're home.

01:00.294 --> 01:03.078
This little human
is meant to be in my family.

01:03.130 --> 01:04.730
Can you still look at me
sexually?

01:04.765 --> 01:07.066
- Hmm.

01:07.101 --> 01:10.219
- You went on a diatribe
as far as jamal is concerned,

01:10.254 --> 01:12.554
and consequently,
it did hurt me

01:12.590 --> 01:14.256
and my children.
- Really?

01:14.308 --> 01:16.608
- If this is what you want,
and it's about your children,

01:16.644 --> 01:18.811
I apologize.
- Oh.

01:20.264 --> 01:22.347
- I want to introduce
you guys to my new friends,

01:22.382 --> 01:23.615
happy ness.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.217
- Wow!
- Ahh!

01:25.252 --> 01:26.735
- Whoa, wendy!

01:26.771 --> 01:29.321
- I am feeling like
the rumors online,

01:29.356 --> 01:32.357
that might be driving her
to show the people

01:32.392 --> 01:34.026
I'm in this hot space
with my husband.

01:34.061 --> 01:35.127
- Imagine being with a man

01:35.162 --> 01:36.595
that consistently
cheats on you.

01:37.581 --> 01:39.031
- Jamal.
- Don't worry.

01:39.066 --> 01:40.699
You don't even have
a relationship

01:40.734 --> 01:41.917
to even care about.

01:41.952 --> 01:43.102
- Shut the (bleep) up!

01:43.137 --> 01:45.604
- Do you need some lettuce?
- Oh! Oh!

01:45.639 --> 01:46.638
- Ah, sh--.

01:46.674 --> 01:49.124
- I'm not talking to candiace
and that idiot.

01:49.176 --> 01:51.760
- Michael refers to chris
as white trash.

01:51.796 --> 01:52.978
- What do you say about him?

01:53.013 --> 01:54.096
You callin' him
a slavedriver?

01:54.131 --> 01:55.380
- Because he drives
his slave.

02:00.955 --> 02:02.688
- The secret
to this pretty face

02:02.723 --> 02:05.457
is stayin' in the shade.

02:05.493 --> 02:07.226
- If you wanna pop off,

02:07.261 --> 02:10.145
I'll be happy
to get you adjusted.

02:10.197 --> 02:14.800
- I may keep you waiting,
but trust me, I'm worth it.

02:14.835 --> 02:17.369
- The only thing messier
than two boys is me.

02:19.206 --> 02:23.575
- My blessings are many,
and my patience is none.

02:23.611 --> 02:26.678
- This professor doesn't
just grade on the curve.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.747
She sets the curve.

02:28.782 --> 02:31.250
- The grand dame can never
be duplicated,

02:31.285 --> 02:33.585
imitated,
or intimidated.

02:35.589 --> 02:40.626
♪♪

02:40.661 --> 02:42.811
- ray!
- I'm right here.

02:42.847 --> 02:44.179
- You gonna
lint roll me, baby?

02:44.231 --> 02:45.130
- No, you don't want me
lint roll you

02:45.149 --> 02:47.032
'cause I only like
to hit certain spots.

02:47.067 --> 02:49.351
[laughing]
- we won't go there.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.303
All right.
Let's go in here, baby.

02:51.338 --> 02:52.404
- Okay.

02:52.439 --> 02:56.074
- Let me call antonia.
Hey, sweetie.

02:57.361 --> 02:58.243
- Good, good.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.195
Look who I got with me today,

03:00.247 --> 03:01.663
my partner in crime
for tomorrow.

03:01.699 --> 03:02.998
- Hey.

03:03.033 --> 03:04.249
- Hey, how you doin'?

03:04.285 --> 03:06.084
- I just wanna walk through
the run of show a little bit

03:06.120 --> 03:08.787
to make sure we're all on
the same sheet of music.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.088
So...

03:10.124 --> 03:11.456
- Okay, I-- I--
I have a question.

03:11.492 --> 03:12.374
- Oh, he--
- I was just reading this.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.293
Any butterflies involved?
- Oh, never mind.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.395
She does not--
we're good, ray.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.730
[screaming]

03:18.766 --> 03:21.066
- ahh!
What the hell is that? Ew!

03:21.101 --> 03:24.169
- Go on.
Go find your mama.

03:24.188 --> 03:25.604
- We're good.
We're good.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.874
[laughing]

03:28.909 --> 03:31.193
- I'm about to renew
my vows to this man

03:31.228 --> 03:33.545
that I have been married
to for 25 years.

03:33.581 --> 03:37.649
So, I am an example to others
like gizelle and robyn.

03:37.685 --> 03:40.285
I'm just sayin'.
Hmm... [laughing]

03:40.321 --> 03:42.821
and I need to make sure
every mother----in' thing

03:42.856 --> 03:44.406
is in place
for this wedding.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.244
- Good.

03:53.267 --> 03:54.366
- We need to make
an adjustment.

03:54.385 --> 03:58.036
Rayvin is not feeling well,
so she will not be there.

03:58.072 --> 04:01.039
I'm so disappointed rayvin
won't be at the wedding.

04:01.058 --> 04:02.391
I was wondering if I could
get you and brandon

04:02.426 --> 04:04.843
to hint to dad.
Up the rock.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.345
- I'm being tasked
with this?

04:06.380 --> 04:08.580
[laughing]

04:08.616 --> 04:10.265
- they suspect
she has a kidney stone,

04:10.317 --> 04:13.402
but I am super excited
because my son will be there,

04:13.437 --> 04:16.188
and he's giving me away
to his dad,

04:16.223 --> 04:20.242
which he gave me away
to ray 25 years ago.

04:20.277 --> 04:23.278
We will be doing
the dang thing tomorrow.

04:24.564 --> 04:25.697
- Yay!

04:25.733 --> 04:28.367
- Tomorrow?
What's tomorrow?

04:28.402 --> 04:31.336
[laughing]

04:31.372 --> 04:33.005
- I'm gonna--
- take care.

04:37.461 --> 04:38.927
- We haven't been here
for a while.

04:38.963 --> 04:41.380
- I know.
I'm bloody starving.

04:41.415 --> 04:42.798
- Hi.
- Hi, guys. Welcome to earls.

04:42.850 --> 04:43.682
- Thank you.
- Table for two?

04:43.717 --> 04:44.983
- Yes, please.
- Table for two, yeah.

04:45.019 --> 04:45.651
- Enjoy, you guys.
- Thanks so much.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.085
- Thank you.
- Of course.

04:47.104 --> 04:48.954
- Oh!
- What happened?

04:48.989 --> 04:51.356
- My booty just
stretched my dress.

04:51.392 --> 04:52.224
- Well, you look lovely,
as usual.

04:52.259 --> 04:53.892
- Thank you. Thank you.

04:53.927 --> 04:54.893
- Hi.
How are you doing today?

04:54.928 --> 04:55.944
- Hello.
- Hi.

04:55.980 --> 04:57.129
I'm-- I'm just gonna do
a corona.

04:57.164 --> 04:58.463
- Pilsner.
- Pilsner, all right.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.431
Sounds good.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.667
- It'll be good to see
ashley and michael.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.268
- Hi, guys. How are you?
- Hi. How are you?

05:03.287 --> 05:05.137
Meeting some friends--
oh, I see them over there.

05:05.172 --> 05:07.605
- Thank you. Hey, hey.
How is it going, babe?

05:07.624 --> 05:08.440
- Michael.
- Hi.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.241
- What's up, ashley?
How you doin'?

05:09.276 --> 05:10.175
- I haven't seen you
in so long.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.510
- Yeah, it's been a while.
- Oh, my gosh.

05:11.545 --> 05:13.412
- Hi, michael. How are you?
- Hi. How are you?
Good to see you.

05:13.447 --> 05:14.212
- Nice toee you.
- Nice to see you guys.

05:14.248 --> 05:15.314
- Thank you.
- Been a long time.

05:15.349 --> 05:16.381
- It's been a very long time.
- What's up, buddy?

05:16.417 --> 05:18.383
- Hey, juan, how are you?
- How are you, my love?

05:18.419 --> 05:19.251
Lookin' so bright
in your fucsia.

05:19.286 --> 05:20.118
- How you doin', man?
Congratulations.

05:20.154 --> 05:21.353
- Oh, thank you.
- Yes, you're all sunny.

05:21.388 --> 05:23.588
- Now that michael and I are
getting back in the saddle...

05:26.026 --> 05:28.626
- I'm feeling very
uncomfortable, right now.

05:28.645 --> 05:30.962
- I want to continue on
having date nights,

05:30.998 --> 05:32.848
and michael loves
hanging out with juan.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.483
- Juan's more interesting.

05:34.518 --> 05:36.651
We get along,
and juan is--

05:36.687 --> 05:39.521
- okay.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.990
I have-- I don't even
have anything else to say.

05:42.026 --> 05:43.308
How are you guys?
- That's awesome.

05:43.344 --> 05:45.410
- Well, ashley's--
- we're good.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.779
- Dean is a phenomenal guy.

05:47.814 --> 05:48.997
- I feel like we're, like,
having all, these,

05:49.033 --> 05:50.032
like, two conversations.
- I know.

05:50.084 --> 05:51.500
- But it's great.
- This is how it usually goes.

05:51.535 --> 05:52.784
It's like--
- it really is.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.002
[laughing]

05:54.038 --> 05:55.754
- can I get any drinks
started for you two?

05:55.789 --> 05:58.290
- I saw a-- a nice spicy
watermelon margarita.

05:58.325 --> 05:59.508
- Yeah, it's good.

05:59.543 --> 06:00.542
- I'm cool with water.
- With water?

06:00.594 --> 06:01.376
- Yes.
- All right, sounds good.

06:01.428 --> 06:03.661
- Thank you.
How's everything else?

06:03.680 --> 06:07.466
- Good. I, so, I worked out
a lot during the pandemic.

06:07.501 --> 06:08.467
I had a trainer.
He's-- he's a great trainer.

06:08.502 --> 06:11.503
He's a world champion
bodybuilder, and I said,

06:11.522 --> 06:13.271
"come to my gym every day."
- okay.

06:13.307 --> 06:14.506
- So, he's training me
five days a week.

06:14.525 --> 06:15.557
- Okay.
- Oh, wow.
- It was like,

06:15.609 --> 06:17.409
that's great-- a personal
trainer five days a week.

06:17.444 --> 06:20.812
- No, you definitely
look good. You look good.

06:20.847 --> 06:23.565
- Michael hasn't really been
excited to be around the group.

06:23.617 --> 06:27.369
I know the only guy that
he really cares about is juan.

06:27.404 --> 06:29.287
- You are a very good man.
- You're my guy.

06:29.323 --> 06:30.522
- No, I'm telling you.
- I know.

06:30.541 --> 06:32.190
- With all this sh--
that happens,

06:32.226 --> 06:36.261
I've stayed true to you
the whole time.

06:36.296 --> 06:40.048
- You heard the sentence,
"I would suck juan's dick."

06:40.084 --> 06:42.417
yes.
- Okay, fine.

06:42.469 --> 06:46.254
And juan, he reciprocates
the love to michael.

06:46.306 --> 06:48.056
I don't know.
I mean, I don't know why.

06:48.092 --> 06:50.442
It's just, hey,
it is what it is.

06:50.477 --> 06:52.077
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.413
Can I get you guys
started with some food?

06:54.448 --> 06:56.264
- Yeah.
- Lobster tostadas, please.

06:56.316 --> 06:57.399
- I'll just--
I'll do the same as you.

06:57.434 --> 06:59.067
- Spicy tuna roll,
a caesar salad.

06:59.103 --> 07:00.485
- Absolutely.

07:00.521 --> 07:01.603
- Clam chowder to start.
- Yeah.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.688
- Shrimp on the side.
- Absolutely. Thank you, guys.

07:03.723 --> 07:05.490
- Michael, are we going
to see-- like, okay,

07:05.526 --> 07:07.325
are you gonna come around
the group, again?

07:07.361 --> 07:08.944
We didn't see you
on the trip.

07:08.996 --> 07:12.230
Like, what is the deal?

07:12.266 --> 07:13.615
- I miss you guys.
There's no question.

07:13.667 --> 07:14.449
- Yeah.
- Yes.

07:14.501 --> 07:17.736
- There's just members
of the crew

07:17.771 --> 07:19.671
that I'd rather not
spend time with.

07:19.706 --> 07:20.906
- Really?

07:20.941 --> 07:22.591
- Especially people who have
said things about my wife.

07:22.626 --> 07:24.209
- He's talking about
candiace and chris.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.460
- Okay.
- Can-- okay.

07:25.512 --> 07:28.430
- The day she gave birth,
you tweeted,

07:28.465 --> 07:30.348
"where is your income, roach?"

07:30.384 --> 07:33.268
you brought
your wide-bodied ass

07:33.303 --> 07:34.436
down to williamsburg.
- Not wide. She's not wide.

07:34.471 --> 07:36.354
- I'm wide?
I'm wide, now?

07:36.390 --> 07:37.439
- I don't even understand
chris. No, I--

07:37.474 --> 07:39.057
- like, you guys
ever try to sit down

07:39.092 --> 07:41.460
and try to hash it out?
- No, no.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.261
- What?
- What, are you touching me?

07:43.297 --> 07:44.629
You touching me?
- What?

07:44.665 --> 07:46.298
- Hey, hey!
You're going to jail,

07:46.333 --> 07:49.000
you baldheaded (bleep)!

07:49.036 --> 07:50.368
I don't even know
what chris does,

07:50.404 --> 07:52.337
and he's basically
living off his wife.
- Well, he's a-- he's--

07:52.372 --> 07:54.372
- which is about
the worst thing you can do.

07:54.408 --> 07:55.940
- You know,
he's her manager now.

07:55.959 --> 07:57.275
- I-- that's--
she told me that.

07:57.294 --> 07:58.743
How does she pay him?

08:01.281 --> 08:02.297
- What?
- Well--

08:02.332 --> 08:03.548
- she pays him in love.

08:03.584 --> 08:06.384
[laughing]

08:06.420 --> 08:08.053
- michael has never
had anything good to say

08:08.088 --> 08:09.387
about the bassetts.

08:09.423 --> 08:11.456
You know,
what's wrong with chris

08:11.475 --> 08:13.458
and what he does
for a living,

08:13.477 --> 08:16.144
and what's wrong with
candiace having a mother

08:16.180 --> 08:17.629
that has supported her?

08:17.648 --> 08:19.097
Like, there's nothing
wrong with that.

08:19.132 --> 08:22.651
You know, it's almost like
he has an elitist attitude

08:22.686 --> 08:23.435
towards them.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.403
- Let's be positive.
- No, we--

08:25.439 --> 08:26.905
I am being positive.
- Okay, coach juan.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.173
- I mean, exactly.
- Also--

08:28.208 --> 08:28.907
- I'd rather talk
about something

08:28.942 --> 08:31.359
that's much more
exciting for me,

08:31.411 --> 08:35.113
and that is
another baby dixon.

08:35.148 --> 08:36.281
Have you guys thought
about waiting

08:36.316 --> 08:37.349
until you have your wedding

08:37.384 --> 08:39.651
before you think about
a family,

08:39.686 --> 08:41.419
or which one do you want
to have first?

08:41.455 --> 08:43.421
Do you wanna
get married first?

08:43.457 --> 08:44.289
- I don't know.
- Not really.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.124
We never talked about that.
- Yeah.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.043
- I just think
it just happens.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.127
- Ha.
Right, then--

08:49.162 --> 08:51.329
- yeah, she doesn't wanna
have to deal with that.

08:51.348 --> 08:52.297
- Yeah, I don't wanna
do it now,

08:52.332 --> 08:54.666
but I didn't enjoy it
13 years ago either.

08:54.685 --> 08:56.384
- Mm-hmm.

08:56.436 --> 08:57.469
- It's kinda one of the
things is, you--

08:57.504 --> 09:00.672
you forget how much work
they are in the beginning.

09:00.707 --> 09:01.839
- Oh, right.
- It's a lot of work.

09:01.858 --> 09:03.074
- Yeah.
- You'll get there, though,

09:03.110 --> 09:04.576
and it--
it comes fast, though.

09:04.611 --> 09:06.444
- That's easy for you
to say.

09:06.480 --> 09:09.581
- Well--
- 'cause I did all the work.

09:09.616 --> 09:11.066
[laughing]
- no, we did all the work.

09:11.118 --> 09:12.551
We worked together.

09:12.586 --> 09:13.535
- Have you ever
changed a diaper?

09:13.570 --> 09:14.886
You didn't change--
- yes, I change-- really?

09:14.922 --> 09:16.854
- Oh, no.

09:16.873 --> 09:18.223
- Well, was-- was this at
the height of your career,

09:18.258 --> 09:19.157
though, when you were
having babies?

09:19.192 --> 09:21.042
- Yeah. Well, no,
I was still playing but--

09:21.078 --> 09:22.994
- I mean,
okay, to be honest,

09:23.029 --> 09:25.997
our relationship
wasn't stable.

09:26.032 --> 09:27.749
So, he wasn't around
as much.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.968
- Mm-hmm.
- So, she has a infant.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.069
- Yes.
- So, they're, like,

09:31.104 --> 09:31.869
18 months apart
just like corey and carter.

09:31.888 --> 09:33.405
- Yeah, just like
corey and carter.

09:33.440 --> 09:34.906
- So, you missed that,

09:34.942 --> 09:38.093
and what she's going through,
is torture.

09:38.145 --> 09:39.978
When corey and carter
were babies,

09:40.013 --> 09:44.432
juan was not really around
that much to help me.

09:44.484 --> 09:46.117
You weren't
very hands on ever.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.736
- Can we stop doing this?

09:47.771 --> 09:50.655
- And honestly, like,
if I was to do it again,

09:50.691 --> 09:52.991
it's not gonna be like
he comes and goes as he pleases,

09:53.026 --> 09:56.561
and I'm stuck to figure out
what's happening with the baby.

09:56.580 --> 09:58.563
- So, when you guys talk
about it, do you flush out

09:58.582 --> 10:00.465
the ifs, the woulds,
the coulds,

10:00.500 --> 10:03.835
all of that stuff?
- No.

10:03.870 --> 10:06.087
It is a lot when you go back
and think about the process.

10:06.123 --> 10:07.789
- It's a lot.
- You'll--

10:07.841 --> 10:09.924
you'll find, though--
I'm older than most people

10:09.960 --> 10:12.093
are used to, but people
are having children later.

10:12.129 --> 10:14.045
So, I don't think
that's a problem.

10:14.081 --> 10:17.799
- Do people ever ask you
if you're his grandfather?

10:17.851 --> 10:20.885
- I haven't had it yet.
- Right.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.721
- Coming up next...

10:22.756 --> 10:24.522
- You're making me out
to be a dickhead, rob.

10:24.558 --> 10:26.274
- No, I'm not.
- I'm done.

10:26.310 --> 10:28.793
Yeah.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.362
- Are you serious,
right now?

10:38.205 --> 10:40.038
- We gotta get across
this light, now.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.323
- Don't move too fast.
- Okay.

10:41.358 --> 10:42.340
- I know candiace is--

10:42.376 --> 10:44.109
- okay, we can go.
- Let's walk. You ready...

10:44.144 --> 10:45.377
...To put the pen
to the paper?

10:45.412 --> 10:48.913
- Put the pen to the paper.
- Pen, sign, girl, on stage.

10:48.949 --> 10:51.883
- Sign, seal,
and deliver, honey. Yes.

10:51.918 --> 10:53.418
- The star--
here's your star.

10:53.453 --> 10:54.252
- Oh, thanks, ma.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.120
Am I the star,
or are you the star?

10:55.155 --> 10:56.955
- Candiace-- candiace,
you're the star.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.156
- Oh, okay,
I'm just checking

10:58.191 --> 10:59.591
'cause, you know.
[laughing]

10:59.626 --> 11:01.159
today is the day.

11:01.178 --> 11:04.162
My manifestations are
coming into my lap.

11:04.181 --> 11:07.465
I came out of the womb singing
some anita baker, chile.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.501
♪ she likes big bones ♪

11:09.536 --> 11:10.535
- oh, lord.
Would you stop?

11:10.570 --> 11:12.704
♪ and she cannot lie ♪
- no, no, not necessary.

11:12.739 --> 11:13.888
[laughing]
I'mma throw up.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.373
- Hello.
- Hi.

11:15.409 --> 11:16.141
- How are you?

11:16.176 --> 11:17.692
Let me show you
to your meeting.

11:17.728 --> 11:18.610
- Thank you.

11:18.645 --> 11:23.314
And I am signing,
finally, my music deal

11:23.349 --> 11:26.067
with e-one nashville.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.352
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hello.

11:27.387 --> 11:28.620
- Oh, hello.

11:28.655 --> 11:30.955
- E-one was
introduced to me

11:30.991 --> 11:33.708
through nye,
my co-writer.

11:33.744 --> 11:35.026
This is the exciting day.

11:35.045 --> 11:37.896
- Oh, yes.
- And I'm so grateful.

11:37.931 --> 11:41.166
Holy jesus, thank you.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.533
Yes.

11:42.552 --> 11:44.719
- Hey, hey.
- Hello.

11:44.755 --> 11:45.870
- There's-- there's
the important person.

11:45.906 --> 11:46.705
- Right, yes.
- Good to meet you
in person, sir.

11:46.740 --> 11:47.422
How is everything?
- Chris, omega.

11:47.474 --> 11:48.006
- Omega.
Nice to meet you, man.

11:48.041 --> 11:48.757
How are you?
- Hi.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.842
- Nice to meet you.
- Finally.

11:50.877 --> 11:51.709
- Yah, finally, finally.
- And this is my mom.

11:51.728 --> 11:53.178
- Your mother is
absolutely beautiful.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.179
Nice to meet you.
- This is omega.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.046
- Oh, thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

11:55.082 --> 11:55.847
- Thank you.
- A pleasure to meet you.

11:55.882 --> 11:56.815
Yes, ma'am.
- Nice to meet you.

11:56.850 --> 11:57.849
- Hey, listen. Listen.
Trying to make sure

11:57.884 --> 12:00.218
we fill the room with
the right-- right energy,

12:00.237 --> 12:00.985
right chemistry.
- Thas right.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.103
Fill the room
with good aromas.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.572
It's still, like, surreal
that this is even going on.

12:04.608 --> 12:05.990
- Yeah, that this is happening,
that we're here.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.242
- Yes.
- That this moment
is happening.

12:07.277 --> 12:09.077
- Yes.
- Well, the song is--

12:09.112 --> 12:10.228
it's clearly a hit.
- Yeah.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.062
- It's definitely--
it's definitely a hit for sure.

12:11.098 --> 12:11.696
- It's clearly a hit.
- Thank you.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.281
- Where are we video-wise?

12:13.333 --> 12:14.749
Do we have any
concepts moving?

12:14.785 --> 12:17.602
- Well, we did shoot two videos.
- Yeah.

12:17.637 --> 12:19.587
- So, we shot "drive back"
and "when" in one week.

12:19.623 --> 12:20.622
- Okay.

12:22.375 --> 12:25.543
♪ you got me pissed off from
my head down to my shoes ♪

12:25.578 --> 12:26.511
- it was crazy.
- Yeah.

12:26.546 --> 12:29.380
- But the videos have
turned out amazing.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.765
- All right.

12:30.801 --> 12:31.800
- We're doing some
final touches on them.
- Yeah. Yeah.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.935
- So, we should be able
to have those to you.

12:33.970 --> 12:36.771
- Obviously, she has enough
for an entire album,

12:36.807 --> 12:38.223
entire project.
- Mm-hmm, absolutely.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.275
- What's, like,
the typical number of singles?

12:40.310 --> 12:42.060
- We get to make the rules up,
so that's the beautiful part

12:42.095 --> 12:42.777
about where we are,
right now.

12:42.813 --> 12:43.928
- Yeah.
- Fine by me.

12:43.963 --> 12:46.564
- Um, we could drop anywhere
from 60-70% of the record

12:46.600 --> 12:48.433
as singles, and then
the drop the record

12:48.468 --> 12:49.150
a few weeks later.

12:49.186 --> 12:51.319
So, I'm thinking,
from today,

12:51.354 --> 12:52.804
we've got about
six weeks of planning

12:52.823 --> 12:54.189
to put some things together.
- Okay, okay.

12:54.241 --> 12:55.807
- And then two weeks
out from that,

12:55.826 --> 12:57.809
put together a pre-order
for the record.

12:57.844 --> 12:58.910
- Oh, my gosh, perfect.
- Um, I think.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.795
- So, it's gotta be real
coordinated on social media.

13:00.831 --> 13:01.663
- Absolutely.
- It would be really on--

13:01.715 --> 13:02.630
- well, that's where--
I shine there.

13:02.666 --> 13:05.950
I'm not worried at all
being able to chat.

13:05.986 --> 13:08.119
- He knows exactly
what I'm talking about.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.754
- You don't think I should?
- I mean...

13:09.790 --> 13:12.223
- You are a disaster on twitter.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.809
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

13:14.845 --> 13:16.427
- You know that most of
the time with a lot of things,

13:16.462 --> 13:18.179
comes controversy
in this business.

13:18.231 --> 13:19.230
- Yes.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.482
- Um, but we wanna
definitely showcase the fact

13:20.517 --> 13:21.983
that you are an artist.

13:22.018 --> 13:24.018
- I remember being--
oh, my god--

13:24.070 --> 13:26.321
in my room
with the hairbrush.

13:26.356 --> 13:27.322
- Uh-huh.

13:27.357 --> 13:29.240
- And I would be dancing
until I was sweating.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.659
Like, I was on
stage performing.

13:31.695 --> 13:33.178
- Wow.
- Yes, yes.

13:33.213 --> 13:34.829
- I'm, like, sitting
at this table.

13:34.865 --> 13:37.031
- Mm-hmm. It's okay.
- Yeah.

13:37.083 --> 13:39.000
- It's okay.
It's understandable.

13:39.035 --> 13:40.451
- I'm just grateful.

13:40.487 --> 13:41.836
- Hey, then we'll just
sign and call it a day.

13:41.872 --> 13:43.788
She's grateful. Good.

13:43.824 --> 13:46.090
- I would be
a hot freaking mess

13:46.126 --> 13:48.843
without chris
by my side,

13:48.879 --> 13:51.513
and my mom showed me
that I could be

13:51.548 --> 13:53.214
whatever I wanted to be,

13:53.266 --> 13:57.385
and she's been there
through everything,

13:57.437 --> 13:58.853
no matter what.

13:58.889 --> 14:02.857
I would not want to
go through any of this

14:02.893 --> 14:04.642
without her being there
to witness it.

14:04.677 --> 14:05.810
I have an amazing team.

14:05.845 --> 14:06.811
Hello.
- Yeah.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.280
I'm excited for the world
to see a side of you

14:09.316 --> 14:11.816
that I don't think
they know just yet.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.484
- Well, I need you to sign.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.886
[laughing]

14:14.921 --> 14:17.872
- oh, my gosh, okay.
I'm, like, shaking.

14:17.908 --> 14:20.625
Okay, I'm signing
on the checks.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.243
- Yes, on the checkmarks.

14:24.047 --> 14:25.163
- That's it?
- That's it.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.832
- I'm signed.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.300
[laughing]
I am signed, now.

14:29.336 --> 14:32.170
- I's married now. Yes.
- Yes, yes.

14:41.348 --> 14:42.213
- What?

14:42.232 --> 14:43.598
Are you laughing
'cause my car is dirty?

14:43.650 --> 14:46.150
- That's ridiculous.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.903
- All right.
I'm in warehouse e.

14:48.939 --> 14:52.657
Oh, this is my space.
[laughing]

14:52.692 --> 14:54.359
welcome to embellished.

14:54.394 --> 14:58.196
To think that I started
my business in my house.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.531
- So, you only
have 14 orders.

15:00.566 --> 15:03.167
- Not only. I've been doing this
for over a month now.

15:03.203 --> 15:06.170
And now, I need
to move into a space

15:06.206 --> 15:09.240
that is, you know,
big and comfortable.

15:09.259 --> 15:11.342
Like, now the hard
work really begins.

15:11.378 --> 15:13.127
This is, like,
official-official.

15:13.179 --> 15:15.046
- Yeah, this is a big step.
- I can't believe it.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.848
It feels like--
- it's good.

15:16.883 --> 15:18.049
[laughing]
- this is so exciting.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.418
- It-- it is a lot
of rack space.

15:20.437 --> 15:22.437
- Right but--
- I don't think you
need this, though.

15:22.472 --> 15:23.938
- Yes, I do.

15:23.974 --> 15:26.224
I'm-- don't worry
about that, okay?

15:26.259 --> 15:27.809
I take the big step
to get this space,

15:27.861 --> 15:30.561
and then I have-- next is
really taking a big step

15:30.596 --> 15:32.897
to, like, really increase
my inventory and stuff.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.283
So, on top of,

15:35.318 --> 15:36.951
we're moving
at some point.

15:36.987 --> 15:41.105
The dixon dwelling, mmm.

15:41.141 --> 15:44.158
So, like,
okay, the house

15:44.210 --> 15:46.294
is allowing us
to have space

15:46.329 --> 15:47.412
for a baby.
- Mm-hmm.

15:47.447 --> 15:51.416
- But before we go down the
road of having a baby,

15:51.451 --> 15:54.385
we have to make sure
that, like,

15:54.421 --> 15:57.221
the things that happened before
don't happen again.

15:57.257 --> 15:59.307
- What things?
- As far as, like,

15:59.342 --> 16:00.925
when corey and carter
were young,

16:00.960 --> 16:02.510
when they were infants--
- don't-- don't bring--

16:02.562 --> 16:03.461
don't do that.

16:03.480 --> 16:05.430
- I'm not doing--
like, it is what it is.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.931
- What do you-- what do you--
what do you mean?

16:06.967 --> 16:07.932
- Have you ever
changed a diaper?

16:07.967 --> 16:08.900
You didn't change--
- yes, I change-- really?

16:08.935 --> 16:10.985
- You did not change a diaper.
- All right.

16:11.021 --> 16:12.987
- If we're going
to have an infant,

16:13.023 --> 16:15.490
I would expect you to be
just as hands on.

16:15.525 --> 16:16.991
- Okay, that was
13 years ago!

16:17.027 --> 16:17.942
- That's why we're
talking about it.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.193
- Okay, there's no
need to talk about it.

16:19.245 --> 16:21.162
People grow.
- It is.

16:21.197 --> 16:22.914
What? You-- you don't
like that conversation?

16:22.949 --> 16:24.666
- No, because you're
being stupid.

16:24.701 --> 16:26.484
You're making me out
to be a dickhead, rob.

16:26.503 --> 16:29.120
- No, I'm not.
- You are.

16:32.675 --> 16:34.442
- You're making me out
to be a dickhead, rob.

16:34.477 --> 16:36.194
- No, I'm not.
- You are.

16:36.246 --> 16:37.862
- What the hell?

16:46.339 --> 16:48.056
- Robyn, you're not going
to keep bringing that up.

16:48.091 --> 16:49.924
I'm done.
I'm done. Here.

16:49.959 --> 16:51.626
- Juan, are you serious?
It's not that serious.

16:51.661 --> 16:53.511
- Yes, yes, it
is that serious.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.513
- It is not that serious.
- It is. Here.

16:55.548 --> 16:56.681
Here you go.

16:56.716 --> 16:57.965
- Are you serious,
right now?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.467
- Yeah, you're not
gonna keep doing that.

16:59.502 --> 17:02.670
- I-- I keep doing what?

17:02.689 --> 17:04.004
[sighs]
lord have mercy.

17:04.024 --> 17:04.739
What?

17:06.376 --> 17:07.842
Juan, you're making it more
serious than what it is.

17:07.877 --> 17:10.228
- Robyn, I'm not the--
I'm not the same dude.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.063
- Okay, and that's
all you have to say.

17:12.115 --> 17:14.382
- Okay. No.
- You took this the wrong way.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.870
- That's not--
juan, I'm talking about

17:18.905 --> 17:19.654
when the kids were--
- and you know I take pride.

17:19.689 --> 17:21.205
I take--
- when they were babies--

17:21.241 --> 17:22.707
when they were infants.
- I take pride.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.909
It's always my flaws
and what I did,

17:24.961 --> 17:28.746
and it's never about
what robyn didn't do.

17:30.867 --> 17:32.967
I'm not talking
about this anymore.

17:33.002 --> 17:34.135
- What the (bleep)?

17:36.272 --> 17:38.039
Jesus christ.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.018
- Ahh!

17:51.053 --> 17:53.321
Oh, my god,
this is stunning.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.908
This is just everything.

17:56.943 --> 18:00.094
I love it.
Look at you.

18:00.130 --> 18:01.596
Muah.
- Muah, muah, muah.

18:01.631 --> 18:03.581
- I'm here.
I'm so excited.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.366
Brandon, you gonna get
mama up those steps?

18:05.401 --> 18:06.167
- Where is brandon?

18:06.202 --> 18:07.535
- He's right here.
He's doing it.

18:07.570 --> 18:09.337
He's waiting for me.

18:09.372 --> 18:12.807
All right, I'm gonna
go and start changing.

18:14.210 --> 18:16.260
- Kamryn, help me
pick out an outfit.

18:16.296 --> 18:17.244
Come.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.213
I like this one.
Do you like this one, mama?

18:19.248 --> 18:21.182
Come on.
You're my personal shopper.

18:23.820 --> 18:24.819
- All right,
let me get my dress,

18:24.854 --> 18:25.820
as I'm sitting here
with this damn nursing bra

18:25.855 --> 18:29.023
sittin' next to my bed.
That's who I am now.

18:29.058 --> 18:30.491
I can't let it define me.

18:30.527 --> 18:33.027
Motherhood does
not define me.

18:33.062 --> 18:35.897
- This is my new dress.
- With the cutout.

18:35.932 --> 18:39.266
- Yes, I'm just gonna wear
my boss pin someone gave me.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.068
No? No boss?
- Ma.

18:41.103 --> 18:42.904
- Okay, so, we don't need that
for this. Okay.

18:44.808 --> 18:45.606
- Hey.

18:45.642 --> 18:47.158
You about to get
ready for the party?

18:48.277 --> 18:50.144
Of course, I already know
that we're gonna be late.

18:54.450 --> 18:57.318
- Okay, so, he is not
happy with me, right now.

18:57.353 --> 18:59.020
I started to have
baby talk with him,

18:59.055 --> 19:01.322
and I was just trying to
make him understand, like,

19:01.357 --> 19:02.423
if I'm gonna think about
having a baby, like,

19:02.458 --> 19:07.762
you better be mr. Mom,
and he, like, got so upset.

19:07.797 --> 19:08.663
He was like--

19:08.698 --> 19:09.514
yes.

19:11.301 --> 19:13.300
Right. Like,
this is a big deal.

19:13.319 --> 19:16.320
If juan can't have
a simple conversation

19:16.356 --> 19:20.140
about the baby thing,
then we have bigger problems,

19:20.160 --> 19:22.827
and I don't even know
where to start.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.529
Let's-let's just go in there.
- Yeah.

19:24.581 --> 19:25.680
- And just decide
to have fun.

19:25.715 --> 19:26.714
- Yes, for sure.

19:26.749 --> 19:28.382
Okay. All right, bye.
- Yep. Okay, all right.

19:28.418 --> 19:29.951
See you soon.

19:36.676 --> 19:37.842
- Where is
the red carpet?

19:37.877 --> 19:40.628
[laughing]

19:40.663 --> 19:44.065
- here you go.
- My goodness, wow.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.267
Everybody is sparkly.
I didn't bring my sparkles.

19:46.302 --> 19:49.003
- Ooh, this feels
like the first time.

19:49.038 --> 19:50.171
This is insane.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.845
- It's ugly.

19:57.864 --> 20:01.199
I need more for
a wedding venue.

20:01.234 --> 20:02.550
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

20:02.585 --> 20:03.484
- Is it what you wanted?

20:03.519 --> 20:07.355
- Oh, my god, this
is a ----ing wedding.

20:07.390 --> 20:09.373
No, ma'am.
- All right.
So, that's it then.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.158
- Where are we, chile?

20:11.193 --> 20:12.326
Hello.

20:14.530 --> 20:16.297
- The bar. We're going up.

20:16.332 --> 20:20.201
Now, hold on a whole
mother----in' minute.

20:20.236 --> 20:22.703
- Thank you, babe.
What would I do without you?

20:22.722 --> 20:23.888
Okay.
Oh, this is cute.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.406
- You got it, mom?
- Yes, I--

20:25.441 --> 20:27.008
- oh, look, mommy.
- Okay, thank you.

20:27.043 --> 20:29.176
- I have to go--
it's very difficult.

20:29.211 --> 20:32.046
- Very slowly.
- We need an elevator.

20:32.065 --> 20:33.097
Ooh, I almost fell.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.732
- You wanna go up these
stairs and to the left.

20:34.767 --> 20:35.716
- What the (bleep)?

20:35.735 --> 20:38.402
I like everything being
on the same floor.

20:38.438 --> 20:39.053
Ha-ha.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.221
Okay, I don't like stairs.

20:40.256 --> 20:42.389
I do not.
I despise stairs.

20:42.408 --> 20:43.724
- Yes.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.359
All right, thank you.

20:46.562 --> 20:48.663
- Do you wanna do a toast
to a great evening?

20:48.698 --> 20:49.614
- All right.
- Cheers to love,

20:49.666 --> 20:50.698
and a great evening.
- Love.

20:50.733 --> 20:52.366
Karen, and ray.
- Cheers.

20:52.402 --> 20:53.951
- Hello, hello.
- Hello, gorgeous.

20:54.003 --> 20:54.735
- Yes.
- My man.

20:54.771 --> 20:55.670
- How ya doin', g?
- I'm good.

20:55.705 --> 20:57.004
- Friends are arriving.
- Hi.

20:57.040 --> 20:59.173
- Hi. How are you?
Good to see you.

20:59.208 --> 21:00.258
I love your dress.

21:00.293 --> 21:01.459
- How you doin', baby?
- Hey.

21:01.511 --> 21:03.577
- How we doin'?
- Congratulations.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.079
- Thank you.

21:05.098 --> 21:07.247
- Oh, look it here.
[laughing]

21:07.267 --> 21:08.716
except for
he's gettin' divorced.

21:08.751 --> 21:09.967
- Okay.

21:10.019 --> 21:12.119
[laughing]

21:13.122 --> 21:14.188
- hi.
- Hey.

21:14.223 --> 21:16.607
- How are you doing?
- Congratulations on the baby.

21:16.643 --> 21:17.775
- Thank you.

21:17.810 --> 21:18.776
- I haven't talked to
you in a long time.

21:18.811 --> 21:19.393
- I know.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.150
- Okay.

21:26.202 --> 21:27.535
- Come on, let's dance.

21:27.570 --> 21:28.903
- Mom.
- Let's twerk.

21:28.938 --> 21:30.371
- Mom, no.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.076
- If I-- if I wanna
go where, now?

21:37.046 --> 21:38.546
Upstairs?
- Yeah.

21:45.338 --> 21:46.821
- Okay.

21:46.856 --> 21:49.006
- Who is that?
Oh, gizelle.

21:49.058 --> 21:50.958
- Yes, come on. Hey.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.593
- Oh, my god,
this is horrible.

21:52.628 --> 21:54.428
- Hi. Muah.

21:54.463 --> 21:55.262
You look great.

21:55.298 --> 21:56.564
- Hi.
- Hey, darling.

21:56.599 --> 21:58.099
- Hey, dorothy. How are you?
- Hi. Good.

21:58.134 --> 21:59.400
How are you doin'?

21:59.435 --> 22:00.318
- Good.

22:02.872 --> 22:03.654
- Yeah, he's coming.

22:06.676 --> 22:09.309
I think that it will be
interesting to see the dynamic

22:09.329 --> 22:11.195
between michael and chris

22:11.247 --> 22:13.030
because michael is never one
to hold his tongue.

22:13.082 --> 22:14.982
He addresses things head on,

22:15.018 --> 22:17.501
and that doesn't always
work out very well,

22:17.553 --> 22:20.221
especially when it comes to
chris bassett.

22:22.058 --> 22:23.391
Coming up next...

22:23.426 --> 22:25.676
- Michael, you can't
sit here and act like

22:25.728 --> 22:27.345
you did nothing wrong.

22:27.397 --> 22:29.597
- You put your hands on me.
You should apologize.

22:29.632 --> 22:31.132
- This is-this is
the whitest privilege.

22:31.167 --> 22:32.133
I have to go.

22:32.168 --> 22:34.301
- How far can this woman go?

22:37.039 --> 22:39.106
♪♪

22:39.142 --> 22:40.474
- all right.
[grunts]

22:40.510 --> 22:42.126
- I thought, like, you know,
the second time,

22:42.178 --> 22:43.878
you wouldn't get butterflies,
but I got 'em now.

22:43.913 --> 22:44.945
- Aww.

22:44.981 --> 22:46.113
- Hey.
- Hi, gorgeous.

22:46.149 --> 22:48.265
- How are you?
- G, this is my mom.

22:48.301 --> 22:49.517
- Y'all look
just like sisters.

22:49.552 --> 22:50.935
- Oh, thank you.

22:50.970 --> 22:52.186
I hear it all the time.

22:52.221 --> 22:54.355
- Hey, there's my man.

22:54.390 --> 22:56.774
Okay, baby, you good?

22:56.809 --> 22:57.792
All right, baby.

22:57.827 --> 23:00.127
- You look so pretty.
- You look beautiful.

23:00.163 --> 23:03.164
- Juan.
- Juan!

23:03.199 --> 23:04.031
- How you doin'?
What's up?

23:04.067 --> 23:05.466
- You're like--
you're like a ghost.

23:05.501 --> 23:06.367
- I'm so happy you're here.
- Yes.

23:06.402 --> 23:07.935
We're so glad to see you.
- Exactly, okay.

23:07.970 --> 23:09.703
How you doin'?

23:11.774 --> 23:13.474
- Oh!
- Oh, boy.

23:13.509 --> 23:14.975
What do we gotta have here?

23:15.011 --> 23:17.244
Okay, we're good.
Get this leg.

23:17.279 --> 23:19.497
Oh, other side.
Okay.

23:20.883 --> 23:22.850
Okay, all right.

23:22.885 --> 23:25.452
This is how.
Okay, all right.

23:25.471 --> 23:26.954
Let me hold this.
Okay.

23:26.973 --> 23:28.322
Watch your head.
Watch your head.

23:28.357 --> 23:30.157
Watch your head.
Okay, all right.

23:30.193 --> 23:31.325
Yes.
- Oh!

23:31.360 --> 23:33.344
- Yes, yes.
[sighs]

23:33.396 --> 23:34.311
yes, there we go.
- Okay.

23:34.347 --> 23:37.698
- We got the boobs intact.

23:37.733 --> 23:38.365
- All right.

23:41.671 --> 23:42.486
- Oh, okay, okay.

23:42.522 --> 23:44.572
- What up, player?
- It's a pleasure.

23:44.607 --> 23:45.840
- Definitely is.
- Nice to see you.

23:45.875 --> 23:47.842
- Nice to see you, as well.

23:47.877 --> 23:49.009
- Muah.

23:49.045 --> 23:51.178
- Hi, robyn.
- Hi, wendy.

23:51.214 --> 23:52.780
- Did you say hi to gizelle?

23:52.815 --> 23:53.998
- You need to ask her
if she said hi to me.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.916
- Boo, you said hi to robyn.

23:55.952 --> 23:58.018
Say hi to gizelle.

23:58.054 --> 24:00.654
- We are here to
celebrate the hugers.

24:00.673 --> 24:03.007
We are here to
celebrate love.

24:03.042 --> 24:06.260
Outside of that,
I have no reason

24:06.295 --> 24:08.963
to care about
robyn and gizelle.

24:08.998 --> 24:12.800
Chile, let me
dust my feathers.

24:12.835 --> 24:14.768
I can't sit.
- How you gonna do this, baby?

24:14.804 --> 24:17.505
- Oh, sh--.
I just heard somethin' rip.

24:17.540 --> 24:19.240
- You talk to wendy?

24:20.776 --> 24:21.892
- Wow.

24:23.079 --> 24:26.897
- She clearly has not let go
from whatever has upset her.

24:26.949 --> 24:28.482
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, hey.

24:28.518 --> 24:29.383
- Hi.
- Sit at this table.

24:29.418 --> 24:31.519
This is the poppin' table.
- You mean--

24:31.554 --> 24:33.921
- tell mr. Ray
to go upstairs, now.

24:33.956 --> 24:34.688
Are the guests happy?

24:34.724 --> 24:35.856
They got--
they got their food?

24:35.892 --> 24:36.624
They got their alcohol?

24:36.659 --> 24:37.191
- The guests are happy.
Exactly.

24:37.210 --> 24:37.825
They got their salads,

24:37.860 --> 24:39.160
so they're good.
- Okay.

24:39.195 --> 24:40.494
- Robyn told me about jamal.

24:40.530 --> 24:42.429
- Yes.
- I'm so sorry.

24:42.465 --> 24:45.666
Have you been on--
dating recently?

24:48.037 --> 24:49.570
- Tell me more.

24:49.605 --> 24:52.372
- He is a commentator.
He's a little younger.

24:52.391 --> 24:54.375
- Like what?
- Probably 34.

24:54.410 --> 24:56.210
- Yes, honey.
- Yeah.

24:56.229 --> 24:57.561
- But he's local?
He lives here, like--

24:57.597 --> 24:59.730
- he's based out of d.C...
Yeah.

25:02.101 --> 25:03.767
- No, sure can't.

25:05.688 --> 25:07.605
- He's none of your
business, nora.

25:07.657 --> 25:09.657
He's none of your business.

25:12.445 --> 25:15.746
That's none of
your business.

25:15.781 --> 25:16.497
None.

25:16.532 --> 25:17.581
You wanna ask me
another question

25:17.617 --> 25:20.067
'cause that's gonna be
none of your business, too?

25:20.102 --> 25:21.368
- Where is my guy, michael?

25:21.403 --> 25:24.338
Michael texted me last night,
and now he's ducking out on us.

25:24.373 --> 25:26.740
- No, no, he's coming.
I promise.

25:26.759 --> 25:28.408
- All right, michael,
right there.

25:28.427 --> 25:31.312
- Oh, boy, I need another
glass of wine already.

25:32.298 --> 25:33.413
- How you been, man?
- I've been good, man.

25:33.432 --> 25:34.748
- You look good.
- I'm-- I'm trying.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.634
- We have busy lives, right?
- That's right.

25:36.686 --> 25:38.319
I lost my wallet
three weeks ago.

25:38.354 --> 25:39.820
She found it
in her car yesterday.

25:39.855 --> 25:43.107
- Just don't lose your ring
'cause he doesn't wear it.

25:43.142 --> 25:45.459
In the house,
he doesn't wear it.

25:45.494 --> 25:47.461
- Okay, so, does
michael take his off?

25:47.496 --> 25:50.864
- He hasn't worn it.
He has dupuytren's.

25:50.900 --> 25:53.100
Basically, he has
a huge knot right here.

25:53.119 --> 25:54.268
- Oh.
- This is-this is really--

25:54.287 --> 25:56.036
- I swear to god.
- Yeah, no.

25:56.072 --> 25:57.621
If I was ashley,
I would make sure

25:57.657 --> 26:01.458
michael had on his ring
every day, okay?

26:01.494 --> 26:02.459
- How long did I
wear my ring for?

26:02.495 --> 26:04.745
A year?
- Ha!

26:04.780 --> 26:05.996
Like, never.

26:06.966 --> 26:08.782
- 'cause I played basketball.
I was--

26:08.818 --> 26:10.000
- oh, taking it off.
Okay. - Yeah.

26:11.470 --> 26:13.453
- Are you going to watch me
staring at your boobs?

26:13.472 --> 26:14.822
- Yeah, you can
stare at them.

26:14.857 --> 26:15.422
[laughing]

26:18.094 --> 26:19.093
- okay,
I'll do it with you.

26:19.128 --> 26:20.094
You're the--
you as the bride?

26:20.930 --> 26:22.663
- No, no, I'm done.
This is it for me.

26:22.698 --> 26:26.066
Macy and I met

26:40.983 --> 26:41.915
We were just chatting
on the phone,

27:00.853 --> 27:02.436
- Yeah, as I get to the door,
I'll let it down.

27:02.471 --> 27:04.355
Okay.
I love the dress.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.673
It's custom made
from turkey

27:06.692 --> 27:07.691
but gettin' that train
up the stairs

27:07.727 --> 27:09.676
is definitely
a concern for me.

27:09.695 --> 27:11.195
I'm gonna position myself.

27:11.230 --> 27:12.813
I'm gonna make it
up those stars

27:12.848 --> 27:15.199
because I'm climbing to my man,
who has stood by me

27:15.234 --> 27:17.568
and all my shenanigans
for 25 years.

27:17.620 --> 27:21.221

You ready?

27:49.769 --> 27:51.919

to see karen walking up to ray

27:56.859 --> 28:00.661

28:00.696 --> 28:03.197
But then after about
seven and a half minutes,

28:03.232 --> 28:06.233
oh, lord, she is
still walking up.

28:06.268 --> 28:07.668
So, where is the jumbotron,

28:07.703 --> 28:10.671

what they're doing?

28:10.706 --> 28:12.756

28:29.442 --> 28:30.774
your friendship.

28:30.810 --> 28:33.444
Kahlil gibran
says it this way.

28:33.479 --> 28:34.812
It's in the sweetness
of friendship

28:34.864 --> 28:36.280
that let there be laughter.

28:36.315 --> 28:39.283
Let's be friends.

28:39.318 --> 28:44.705
- I mean, maybe the institution
is just a friendship.

28:45.658 --> 28:47.274
Whew, I was gonna say
some terrible things.

28:47.293 --> 28:48.158
I'm just not.

28:48.210 --> 28:49.376
Me and karen need to stay

29:14.503 --> 29:16.720
And would you?

- We know that marriage
is not perfect,

Now, you don't have it on.
