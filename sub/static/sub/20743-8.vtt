Hey.

07:25.882 --> 07:27.883
How is she?

07:29.909 --> 07:31.470
Okay, I guess.

07:31.554 --> 07:33.355
She's lost a lot of blood.

07:33.390 --> 07:35.474

07:35.558 --> 07:38.811
Shouldn't you be at the hospital?

07:38.895 --> 07:40.729
Yeah, I was.

07:40.814 --> 07:42.815

07:42.899 --> 07:46.619
they don't really approve of me.

07:47.871 --> 07:51.073
This wasn't a random break-in, was it?

07:52.125 --> 07:54.126
No.

07:54.210 --> 07:57.079
Somebody sent him.

08:01.418 --> 08:04.336
- I think he was looking for me.
- Yes.

08:04.421 --> 08:08.173
And Daniel Frye. We found a note.

08:08.258 --> 08:10.309
Where is he?

08:10.393 --> 08:12.845
Have you heard from him?

08:12.929 --> 08:15.014
I'm afraid he's gonna do something crazy.

08:15.098 --> 08:16.348
He sent me this...

08:16.433 --> 08:19.435
this text that he was gonna
get Sebastian Cerisola.

08:21.237 --> 08:23.155
He's going to Grupo Clio?

08:23.239 --> 08:25.607
I honestly have no idea.

08:25.692 --> 08:29.611
You better tell me what you know, Adriana.

08:29.696 --> 08:33.248
Look, we've linked Fausto
Galvan and his cartel

08:33.283 --> 08:35.417
to a housing development in El Paso.

08:35.452 --> 08:36.751
It's called Red Ridge View.

08:36.785 --> 08:38.620
I know it. I was just there.

08:38.705 --> 08:40.839
Detective, it's not just Fausto Galvan.

08:40.924 --> 08:42.791
It's much bigger than that.

09:30.673 --> 09:33.425

09:37.647 --> 09:39.231
No.

10:49.382 --> 10:52.023

12:27.895 --> 12:29.145
Get in.

12:29.230 --> 12:32.565
- What are you doing here?
- Just get in. Now, Detective.

12:35.703 --> 12:38.738
McKENZIE: <i>You here because of
what happened with the reporters?</i>

12:38.823 --> 12:41.574
SONYA: <i>Yes. Why are you here?</i>

12:41.659 --> 12:44.127
We think this place is a significant part

12:44.211 --> 12:47.080
of Fausto Galvan's money
laundering operation.

12:49.083 --> 12:51.334
What are you gonna do about that?

12:51.419 --> 12:53.420
Look, for almost ten years,

12:53.504 --> 12:55.889
I have been after Fausto Galvan.

12:55.923 --> 12:57.757
But every time I file an action report,

12:57.842 --> 13:00.477
the CIA swoops in and starts cutting deals.

13:00.561 --> 13:02.479
So I'm left with my cock in my hand

13:02.563 --> 13:03.763
and Fausto slithers away.

13:03.848 --> 13:06.149
I want Eleanor Nacht.

13:07.518 --> 13:09.019
That makes two of us, Detective.

13:09.103 --> 13:11.938
All right, look, she has the road map

13:12.023 --> 13:14.941
to every single one of
Fausto's money operations...

13:15.026 --> 13:18.161
where he hides, everything.

13:18.245 --> 13:21.448
Get her, I have a good shot at him.

13:23.284 --> 13:25.335
Okay, so how do we get her?

13:25.419 --> 13:27.337
Not "we."

13:27.421 --> 13:29.789

13:37.431 --> 13:38.765

13:38.799 --> 13:41.217
No.

13:41.302 --> 13:44.471
I think we can help each other.

13:44.522 --> 13:46.973
I arrest her for murder...

13:47.024 --> 13:48.475
you get to question her.

13:48.526 --> 13:50.610
And you get Fausto.

13:53.481 --> 13:55.782
- I can work with that.
- Good.

13:55.816 --> 13:58.485
We keep a tight circle on this.

13:58.569 --> 14:01.287
Only you and Hank Wade.

14:01.322 --> 14:03.156
Not a word to Marco Ruiz.

14:03.240 --> 14:05.325
Marco is part of our investigation.

14:05.409 --> 14:07.410
No, Detective Cross, he's not.

14:07.495 --> 14:11.081
Fausto Galvan and Marco
Ruiz grew up together.

14:11.165 --> 14:14.334
Their fathers were in the business.

14:15.636 --> 14:17.220
He's not to be trusted.

14:19.223 --> 14:21.341
Th-That's not possible.

14:21.392 --> 14:23.810
It's not something that
he'd like everyone to know,

14:23.844 --> 14:25.845
but they go way back.

14:30.101 --> 14:32.185
Take a look at this.

14:32.269 --> 14:35.355
David Tate was murdered
in prison last night.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.361
Ask Marco how that happens.

15:09.557 --> 15:11.558

15:39.637 --> 15:41.703

15:41.729 --> 15:43.897
I don't know anything about you.

15:43.923 --> 15:46.875
I don't really know anything
about you, either.

15:46.901 --> 15:48.902
You haven't asked.

15:53.650 --> 15:57.243
Okay, uh, I'm asking.

15:57.269 --> 15:58.987
I want to... I want to know.

16:04.278 --> 16:07.414
I grew up in a very small town.

16:07.448 --> 16:10.000
In the mountains.

16:10.084 --> 16:12.786
We grew poppies... (speaks Spanish)

16:15.790 --> 16:17.958
We never had any money.

16:18.042 --> 16:21.094
And I always wanted to get out of there,

16:21.129 --> 16:23.680

16:24.882 --> 16:27.298
When I was 13, I...

16:27.324 --> 16:30.243
I won a local beauty pageant.

16:33.357 --> 16:36.777
My mom, she made the dress for me.

16:36.811 --> 16:39.780

16:39.814 --> 16:42.315

16:43.092 --> 16:45.544
He wasn't always bad.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.942
Well, people never are.

16:51.793 --> 16:55.245

16:55.329 --> 16:59.166

That sounds too easy... what's the catch?

23:59.495 --> 24:01.045
(sighs)

24:01.130 --> 24:03.214
They don't want Marco involved.

24:05.217 --> 24:07.218
Why not?

24:09.221 --> 24:11.556
David Tate's dead.

24:12.992 --> 24:14.660
I heard.

24:16.061 --> 24:19.731
I think Fausto had him killed.

24:19.815 --> 24:21.649
For Marco.

24:24.103 --> 24:26.154
Have you asked Marco about that?

24:27.690 --> 24:30.942
Joe says their fathers
used to run together.

24:31.026 --> 24:32.660
Did you know that?

24:32.695 --> 24:33.861
Yup.

24:33.946 --> 24:35.863
When I heard the rumors,

24:35.948 --> 24:38.700
I... figured he was his own man, though.

24:38.751 --> 24:40.535
- Yeah, well, he's not.
- Okay.

24:40.586 --> 24:42.537
Okay, so do I have your permission?

24:42.588 --> 24:44.038
Those Fed types,

24:44.089 --> 24:46.290
they don't give a shit
whether Eleanor Nacht

24:46.375 --> 24:49.210
is held accountable for what
she did to that little boy.

24:49.261 --> 24:51.679
It doesn't feature in their big picture.

24:51.714 --> 24:53.348
I'm doing it, Hank.

24:53.382 --> 24:56.201
Sonya, I won't be coming in...

24:56.227 --> 24:59.256
until they figure out this deal with Dobbs.

25:05.310 --> 25:07.395
Good.

25:07.446 --> 25:09.864
Seems only fair.

25:09.898 --> 25:12.867
You need to be held accountable.

25:51.607 --> 25:54.442
(engine starts)

25:55.444 --> 25:58.863
So, how are we?

25:58.947 --> 26:02.333
ELEANOR: Good. I followed Detective Cross.

26:03.619 --> 26:06.788
SEBASTIAN: Will she be a problem?

26:06.839 --> 26:10.124
I don't know. She's police.

26:10.175 --> 26:13.344
They may ask questions.

26:13.429 --> 26:15.713
I will watch her.

26:15.798 --> 26:18.299
She's an interesting person.

26:19.852 --> 26:23.471
Fausto and I disagree about Red Ridge.

26:23.555 --> 26:26.023
I want out, but Fausto... (sighs)

26:26.108 --> 26:29.944
he thinks that he can
kill his way out of this.

26:29.978 --> 26:32.647
He can't.

26:33.866 --> 26:36.150
He will try.

26:38.153 --> 26:41.289
Can you remove my name?

26:43.888 --> 26:46.807
Why would I do that?

26:46.833 --> 26:51.999
Because you want to be on the right
side if something happens to Fausto.

26:52.050 --> 26:54.669
How would you protect me?

26:58.891 --> 27:02.393
Sell Red Ridge immediately; take the loss.

27:05.347 --> 27:08.232
Can you find a buyer?

27:09.651 --> 27:11.686
I already have one.

27:11.770 --> 27:14.155
Who?

27:14.189 --> 27:17.158
A group who can be trusted.

27:17.192 --> 27:20.194
(chuckles) Okay.

27:22.865 --> 27:24.532
Join me.

27:24.583 --> 27:26.701
There's a future with me.

27:26.785 --> 27:29.837
With Fausto, none.

27:29.872 --> 27:32.373
The Marines will be coming for him.

27:32.457 --> 27:34.709
What are you asking me?

27:36.428 --> 27:38.596
I will pay you.

27:41.717 --> 27:44.352
You don't have what I want.

27:44.386 --> 27:46.687
Fausto does.

27:47.973 --> 27:50.274
Maybe you could tell me.

27:55.397 --> 27:57.899
What's shared in private
should be kept private.

27:57.983 --> 27:59.984

29:56.260 --> 29:58.545
I just spoke to Frye and Adriana.

30:01.178 --> 30:03.346
David Tate was killed.

30:07.184 --> 30:08.768
When?

30:09.492 --> 30:11.744
Yesterday.

30:12.322 --> 30:15.157
He was poisoned.

30:15.359 --> 30:17.527
Why did you visit him?

30:19.433 --> 30:21.401
I wanted to...

30:21.865 --> 30:23.699
look him in the eye.

30:29.873 --> 30:32.425
Did Fausto Galvan

30:32.509 --> 30:34.210
have him killed for you, Marco?

30:35.654 --> 30:37.688
I know about you two.

30:39.274 --> 30:40.241
