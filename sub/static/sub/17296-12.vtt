Hey, checks it. I picked these
flowers, and they's for Raven.

00:28.767 --> 00:32.423
Oh! It is the romantical gesture.

00:32.467 --> 00:35.557
And you got those expensive
ones, that come with the bees.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.125
Nice.

00:38.168 --> 00:40.953
That's what's up!
And I'mma win her heart, once and for all,

00:40.997 --> 00:43.086
with some classic
gifts of love, yo.

00:43.130 --> 00:46.959
Yeah, I don't think Raven is the
type to be won over with flowers.

00:48.483 --> 00:50.267
Oh yeah? Check it.

00:50.311 --> 00:52.095
For you, my fair lady-mamma.

00:52.139 --> 00:53.357
How original.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.146
My eyes!

01:02.801 --> 01:06.066
Okay. This cuddly bear
is too cute not to work.

01:07.632 --> 01:09.243
Is that a real bear cub?

01:09.286 --> 01:12.420
Yeah! 'Cause my love
for Raven is real.

01:12.463 --> 01:14.422
- Hey Raven, I...
- No.

01:14.465 --> 01:15.684
Aw, man...

01:15.727 --> 01:17.468
Oh look, here comes your momma.

01:28.175 --> 01:32.222
I will now recite a poem for the
most loveliest girl in the world.

01:34.703 --> 01:39.273
Vin mortis porcullius,
et vorcullion. Kelvuvu.

01:39.316 --> 01:42.145
- Beautiful.
- My dude!

01:42.189 --> 01:44.191
I didn't know you
write those good poems.

01:44.234 --> 01:47.019
Actually, I just found this one
in one of Raven's poetry books.

01:47.063 --> 01:49.239
Since when do you
like poetry, Raven?

01:49.283 --> 01:50.806
Oh, that wasn't
a book of poetry.

01:50.849 --> 01:52.199
It was a book of evil spells.

01:59.336 --> 02:03.253
I don't know why she
won't accept my gifts of love.

02:03.297 --> 02:06.430
You need to stop with all this
played-out garbage, my dude.

02:06.474 --> 02:08.519
- Get real with Raven.
- I did!

02:08.563 --> 02:10.652
With that bear cub.

02:10.695 --> 02:13.959
What Cyborg's saying is that flowers,
borrowed poetry, and other unoriginal ideas

02:14.003 --> 02:16.614
aren't going to work.
You need to do something genuine.

02:16.658 --> 02:20.096
Something that can be
for only the you and the her.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.447
Hmm, something special
that only she can have?

02:23.491 --> 02:25.710
Yeah! Like that song
you wrote for Tara.

02:25.754 --> 02:29.540
Oh yeah!
I hears you, I hears you.

02:29.584 --> 02:31.760
This is for you, momma.

02:31.803 --> 02:34.589
♪ You can't fade away,
the way I feel for you... ♪

02:35.633 --> 02:37.418
Please do the excusing of us.

02:37.461 --> 02:41.422
You must never play the female
the song of another female!

02:41.465 --> 02:44.512
The key is, you need to write
a song for her, and her only.

02:44.555 --> 02:46.905
A whole new song?
That's so hard, yo!

02:46.949 --> 02:51.171
How am I supposed to even come up with the
words when my feelings for Raven are so big?

02:51.214 --> 02:54.478
Don't worry about it!
We'll help you find them words.

02:57.829 --> 03:01.529
Your song needs to tell Raven that
you love her more than anything else.

03:01.572 --> 03:04.793
- I do!
- Even more than... Duh, duh duh!

03:05.359 --> 03:06.447
Food?

03:08.579 --> 03:10.668
I don't know.
I haven't thought about that.

03:10.712 --> 03:14.324
There's only one way to find out.
Do you love Raven more than peaches?

03:14.368 --> 03:16.805
I do!

03:16.848 --> 03:18.459
Do you love her more than
this good plum?

03:18.502 --> 03:19.764
Yup.

03:21.723 --> 03:23.681
Applesauce?

03:23.725 --> 03:26.249
Mmm-hmm.

03:26.293 --> 03:28.947
Bro, I loves Raven more
than any fruit-based food.

03:28.991 --> 03:31.515
All right! Now we're
getting somewhere.

03:31.559 --> 03:33.604
Get ready, 'cause this one
is about to get hard.

03:38.566 --> 03:41.525
Aw man, a smoothie and pizza?

03:41.569 --> 03:42.700
That is hard!

03:42.744 --> 03:44.572
You know what dude?

03:44.615 --> 03:48.010
All I wants to do with
that food is share it with my...

03:48.053 --> 03:50.752
Bae!

03:50.795 --> 03:53.102
Oh my goodness!
You are in love.

03:53.145 --> 03:55.583
But just to be sure,
here's the real test.

03:55.626 --> 04:00.196
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

04:00.240 --> 04:02.720
Seven layer cake!

04:02.764 --> 04:05.027
That's seven layers
of flavors, yo!

04:05.070 --> 04:07.638
But you knows what?
I loves my Rae more.

04:07.682 --> 04:09.510
Are you sure? You better
check each layer.

04:09.553 --> 04:11.947
I don't know, dude.
I'm not feeling so good.

04:11.990 --> 04:15.690
Don't do it, man!

04:15.733 --> 04:17.300
Check that cake, dude!

04:18.606 --> 04:20.042
Oh, I love her more
than that one.

04:20.085 --> 04:21.609
Love her more.

04:21.652 --> 04:22.740
Love Rae...

04:22.784 --> 04:24.394
Love my bae more...

04:24.438 --> 04:26.004
My momma wins...

04:26.048 --> 04:29.486
Raven rules...
It's all about my baby!

04:30.661 --> 04:32.576
You really do love her.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.752
I'm so happy for you.

04:34.796 --> 04:36.928
I really do...

04:40.715 --> 04:43.892
It is not enough to love friend
Raven more than the foodstuffs.

04:43.935 --> 04:48.723
You must also tell her the feelings you
feel when you think the thoughts of her.

04:48.766 --> 04:50.812
Oh! I gets it.

04:50.855 --> 04:53.336
You mean that I should tell her I feel
likes I gots the toots when I see her.

04:53.380 --> 04:54.903
'Cause I'm nervous.

04:54.946 --> 04:56.687
Never tell friend Raven
of the nervous toots!

04:58.907 --> 05:02.127
Let us instead focus on the nice things
that give you the nice thoughts of her.

05:02.171 --> 05:04.347
Hmm. I don't knows...

05:04.391 --> 05:08.133
Then we shall experiment with the situations
that might remind you of friend Raven.

05:10.745 --> 05:13.878
I don't know, I don't
get what we're doing here.

05:13.922 --> 05:18.622
How's this gonna help me write a song? It's
just a nice warm summer day, and...

05:18.666 --> 05:21.103
I'm thinking of her.
I'm thinking of her!

05:21.146 --> 05:23.497
It seems the summertime
makes you think of the her.

05:25.542 --> 05:28.153
Yeah, totally thinking of her.

05:28.197 --> 05:30.939
- Wait, no.
- That is probably for the best.

05:34.943 --> 05:36.118
Ooh, ooh, ooh, thinking of her!

05:36.161 --> 05:37.989
- The toes in the sand.
- Noted.

05:41.819 --> 05:43.125
Howdy!

05:43.168 --> 05:44.387
Not thinking about her.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.960
Woo, oh, oh! Ah!

05:52.003 --> 05:54.745
I wish Raven was here!

05:55.964 --> 05:57.313
The carnival ride...

05:57.357 --> 05:58.358
I think we have...

05:58.401 --> 06:00.447
The good list.

06:00.490 --> 06:02.971
Yo, I got some good
words for this song, now.

06:03.014 --> 06:04.799
I think she's gonna
really like my thoughts.

06:04.842 --> 06:06.801
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Summertime
and peaches are all fine.

06:06.844 --> 06:09.760
But what's a good love song
without a little paranoia?

06:09.804 --> 06:12.154
- What's paranoia?
- So glad you asked!

06:15.113 --> 06:19.030
First, tell me about your deepest
insecurities when it comes to Raven.

06:19.074 --> 06:22.730
Hmm. Sometimes I thinks about us,
and we're walking hand in hand,

06:22.773 --> 06:25.428
and all of a sudden, she
has to go to the bathroom.

06:25.472 --> 06:28.344
Bathroom? Hmm, hmm, hmm,
that's odd.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.041
What could she
be doing in there?

06:30.085 --> 06:32.696
- I don't know.
- And why has it been so long?

06:32.740 --> 06:33.871
That's what I was thinking!

06:33.915 --> 06:36.091
- Did she meet somebody new?
- Did she?

06:36.134 --> 06:39.355
Is she having second thoughts?
Maybe she's sneaking out through a window.

06:39.399 --> 06:43.359
Maybe she's going to stay with her sister
for a few days to figure things out!

06:43.403 --> 06:45.317
Oh my gosh!
I gotta go in there!

06:45.361 --> 06:47.407
You can't!
It's the ladies room.

06:47.450 --> 06:51.672
You're just going to have to wait until
she comes out, if she ever comes out!

06:55.850 --> 06:57.242
I'm going cray...

06:57.286 --> 07:00.681
Ooh, that's good.
"I goes cray without my bae."

07:00.724 --> 07:02.944
- Thanks Robin.
- Glad I could help.

07:02.987 --> 07:06.643
I gots enough ideas and words about
things to start writing, yo.

07:06.687 --> 07:09.907
Now I gots to go
do that hard work in the lab.

07:09.951 --> 07:14.825
Okay, so I like her more than peaches,
plums, apple tarts and seven layer cakes.

07:14.869 --> 07:17.611
I thinks of her when it's
summertime, or on carnival rides,

07:17.654 --> 07:19.961
and when I put my toes
in the sand,

07:20.004 --> 07:22.442
and the worst thing that could happen
is her going to the bathroom...

07:22.485 --> 07:24.966
I just need to put that
into a melody, yo. Easy.

07:25.009 --> 07:27.969

yeah it's all about bae ♪

07:28.012 --> 07:30.188

09:23.345 --> 09:25.869
I puts all my thoughts
in there for you, Rae.

09:25.913 --> 09:26.914
Only you.

09:37.489 --> 09:39.796
Way to go, my dude!

09:41.319 --> 09:43.017
- Oh, I uh...
- Oh wow...

09:43.060 --> 09:45.672
- That just happened...
- I'll take another...

09:45.715 --> 09:47.804
You know, that song
is really catchy.

09:47.848 --> 09:51.852
I wish everyone in the world could hears
it, so they know how much I loves you.

09:51.895 --> 09:54.289
Well, I know how much
you love me.

09:54.332 --> 09:58.336
But if I put it on the Internets, billions
of people could be hearing your song!

09:58.380 --> 10:02.514
- How cool is that?
- Beast Boy, this is perfect. It's finally perfect!

10:02.558 --> 10:04.299
After all this time.

10:04.342 --> 10:07.041
I like that it's just my song.
Why mess with it?

10:07.084 --> 10:08.956
'Cause I'm always
fiddling with things.

10:08.999 --> 10:11.175
How about not fiddling
with it this time?

10:11.219 --> 10:13.700
- I gots to fiddle with it, momma!
- Please don't fiddle.

10:13.743 --> 10:17.573
I'm fiddling, fiddling,
fiddling, fiddling, fiddling!

10:17.617 --> 10:21.185
Fiddle!
Fiddling, I'm fiddling!

10:21.229 --> 10:23.971
- Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.
- Don't,

10:24.014 --> 10:26.364
fiddle with it!

10:26.408 --> 10:28.062
All right, momma.

10:30.891 --> 10:33.545
I can't stop
fiddling, fiddling, fiddling.

10:33.589 --> 10:34.808
Fiddling!
