science4me.net (Yeah, I'm doing awesome.
In the best shape of my life.)

00:08.680 --> 00:12.650
- You've been taking your pills?
- Yeah, sure I'm taking 'em.

00:12.684 --> 00:15.185
You seem kind of obsessed
with your body, Jonny.

00:15.220 --> 00:17.688
In the past it's been a sign
you're off your meds.

00:17.723 --> 00:20.658
Look, look, look.
It's good, right?

00:20.692 --> 00:23.493
Some guys take steroids.
I don't. I don't need it.

00:23.527 --> 00:25.462
I work it.

00:28.833 --> 00:31.701
- Feel that.
- No, thank you, Jonny.

00:31.736 --> 00:33.703
Yeah, do it.
Feel how hard I am.

00:33.738 --> 00:37.574
I said no thank you, and
you're making me uncomfortable.

00:43.046 --> 00:45.382
No, no, no. Maya, wait, wait.
Please, please don't go.

00:45.416 --> 00:48.318
Just stay, here. I wanna
show you something, all right?

00:48.352 --> 00:50.320
Look how hard I can punch,

00:50.354 --> 00:53.723
right? I can protect people.
I can protect you.

00:53.758 --> 00:57.459
There's bad guys out there, and I'll kill 'em.
No, wait, wait.

00:57.494 --> 00:59.962
Maya, I don't want you
to leave.

00:59.997 --> 01:02.131
I know you don't,
but I'm leaving.

01:02.166 --> 01:04.132
Maya, just stay with me
a little, OK?

01:04.168 --> 01:07.336
- You could read to me.
- Goodbye, Jonny.

- Hey, Maya.

01:22.352 --> 01:24.320
Sorry I missed your call.
Everything OK?

01:24.354 --> 01:27.723
I just left Jonny Franco's.
He is way off his meds.

01:27.757 --> 01:30.358
We need to get him back
on injections, like, tomorrow.

01:30.392 --> 01:32.127
And I'm gonna need backup.

01:32.161 --> 01:35.130
I don't have extra staff
tomorrow.

01:35.164 --> 01:37.866
Stella, he's pretty volatile.
I'm worried.

01:37.900 --> 01:39.968
OK, I'll call Randy.

01:40.002 --> 01:42.838
Thank you.
See you tomorrow.

01:42.872 --> 01:44.372
Bye, Maya.

01:49.911 --> 01:52.913
- Oh!
- We don't want you here.

02:50.537 --> 02:52.471
I got your text.
What's the story?

02:52.506 --> 02:54.473
A mental health worker was
murdered last night

02:54.508 --> 02:56.409
on her rounds.
Cause of death?

02:56.443 --> 02:58.611
Single blow to the head.
No weapons on scene,

02:58.645 --> 03:01.580
- no witnesses.
- This nurse, what was her name?

03:01.615 --> 03:03.749
Maya Henson.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.751
Oh, my god, Maya?

03:05.786 --> 03:07.920
Maya...

03:07.954 --> 03:11.056
You knew her?
Give us a minute.

03:13.643 --> 03:15.928
Leo, I'm sorry.

03:15.962 --> 03:17.629
Was... was she...

03:17.663 --> 03:19.631
No, there was no sign
of sexual assault.

03:19.665 --> 03:21.666
From what we can tell,
she died instantly.

03:23.836 --> 03:27.605
I mean, she was...
Maya was one of the best.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.608
So, you're thinking the killer
was one of her clients?

03:30.643 --> 03:32.610
She was case manager
for a number of clients

03:32.645 --> 03:35.447
with a history
of violence, so...

03:35.481 --> 03:38.182
Her husband, Brendan.
He know yet?

03:38.216 --> 03:40.184
He called in when she didn't
come home last night.

03:40.218 --> 03:43.120
I have a detective doing
the death notification now.

03:43.155 --> 03:45.489
This is gonna rip him apart.

03:45.523 --> 03:48.359
They've been together
since high school, and I'm...

03:48.393 --> 03:50.361
I was really good friends
with both of them.

03:50.395 --> 03:52.182
You wanna take a pass
on this one?

03:52.302 --> 03:57.334
No. I want to find out
who did this.

03:57.368 --> 04:00.337
Maya Henson, age 36.

04:00.371 --> 04:02.405
Worked out of
St. Stephen's.

04:02.440 --> 04:04.475
Jogger found the body
this morning.

04:04.509 --> 04:06.477
And the head wound is
the only injury?

04:06.511 --> 04:07.978
Uh, yeah.

04:08.012 --> 04:10.814
- We know what did it?
- Preliminary assessment says

04:10.849 --> 04:13.216
the weapon had heft
and a sharp point.

04:13.250 --> 04:16.185
Thank you. All right,
first thing we'll need is

04:16.220 --> 04:18.188
a list of her appointments
yesterday.

04:18.221 --> 04:20.190
I already asked her supervisor
to send it over.

04:20.224 --> 04:22.592
With the ones who live near
here at the top of the list.

04:22.626 --> 04:25.999
- Which, of course, you've already done.
- Problem is, her last

04:26.119 --> 04:28.228
appointment is nowhere
near here, nor is her house.

04:28.348 --> 04:31.688
Strange. This is a hard street
to find. Suburban maze.

04:31.721 --> 04:34.122
So, Maya Henson didn't end up
here by accident.

04:34.157 --> 04:36.024
What about the neighbours?
Have we started canvassing yet?

04:36.059 --> 04:38.126
- Yeah, uniforms are on it.
- All right.

04:38.161 --> 04:40.128
We need our own eyes out there.

04:40.163 --> 04:42.865
- Someone's seen this girl.
- I'll help.

04:42.899 --> 04:46.801
- Never done it.
- Yeah, good, you go with Poppy.

04:46.836 --> 04:49.404
Leo and I will work backward
from her appointment book.

04:49.438 --> 04:51.473
He's done her job; it'll be good
to have him with me.

04:51.507 --> 04:53.775
And away from here.

04:53.895 --> 04:58.027
==sync, correction by dcdah==
for www.addic7ed.com

05:00.349 --> 05:02.783
OK, we're just about done here.

05:02.817 --> 05:05.953
I got guys going both directions.
I'll call 'em, get you an update.

05:05.988 --> 05:08.693
No, that's OK. Dr. Malone and I are
gonna canvass this street again.

05:08.813 --> 05:11.392
What, you don't think your
dad's doing a good enough job?

05:11.426 --> 05:14.128
Just trying to do my job, Dad.

05:16.164 --> 05:18.164
Hey, how ya doin', sweetheart?
What's up?

05:18.199 --> 05:21.167
- Listen, Ray, we missed this street.
- What?

05:21.202 --> 05:23.604
I don't know
how the hell it happened.

05:23.638 --> 05:25.606
We're gonna have
to start all over.

05:25.640 --> 05:28.043
No, Ray, we've already done
that one already, OK?

05:28.163 --> 05:29.334
What we've got to do is this dead end

05:29.454 --> 05:31.645
over here; that's where we're
gonna go next, all right?

05:31.679 --> 05:33.746
That's OK. Dr. Malone
and I got this covered.

05:33.781 --> 05:35.748
We're doing it again.
OK, then, fancy pants.

05:35.783 --> 05:37.984
See you later.

05:38.019 --> 05:40.053
What the hell's a doctor
doing on a canvass?

05:40.087 --> 05:42.155
She gonna take
everybody's pulse?

05:45.359 --> 05:47.693
Maya called about Jonny,
but she seemed more concerned

05:47.728 --> 05:50.996
than upset.
Should I have done something?

05:51.031 --> 05:54.166
Jonny Franco didn't do it. He
spent the night with his mother.

05:54.200 --> 05:57.470
These are the rest
of her clients.

05:57.504 --> 06:00.306
Did Maya pay home visits
to anyone potentially violent?

06:00.340 --> 06:04.477
No. I mean, everyone's
potentially violent.

06:04.511 --> 06:07.313
Maya knew how to assess risk;
She was the best with

06:07.347 --> 06:09.815
the volatile ones.
How's Brendan?

06:09.849 --> 06:12.351
Have you talked to him?
He must be shattered.

06:12.385 --> 06:15.287
No, I haven't yet.

06:15.322 --> 06:17.689
How were things
between Maya and her husband?

06:17.723 --> 06:19.847
You know,
the usual ups and downs.

06:19.967 --> 06:22.561
What about her coworkers?
Did she do much socializing?

06:22.595 --> 06:26.397
- I'm not sure what you're asking.
- I'm asking if Maya had

06:26.432 --> 06:29.133
any other relationships
that we should know about.

06:29.168 --> 06:31.803
Aidan, Maya wasn't like that.

06:31.838 --> 06:33.338
Stella, was Maya seeing

06:33.372 --> 06:34.840
someone else?

06:34.874 --> 06:38.810
Look, your friend is
dead, Stella.

06:38.845 --> 06:41.512
Please help us find
who killed her.

06:41.546 --> 06:46.150
She told me things weren't
good with Brendan...

06:46.185 --> 06:49.120
hadn't been for a while.

06:49.154 --> 06:52.656
I... I think she was
seeing someone.

06:52.691 --> 06:56.527
Do you know who, Stella?
I mean, can you give us a name?

06:56.561 --> 07:00.831
I don't know.

07:00.866 --> 07:03.100
I don't like any of the
clients for it. I mean, they're

07:03.134 --> 07:05.369
not all alibied, but I think
this is about the affair.

07:05.403 --> 07:07.371
All right, well,
see what the husband knows.

07:07.405 --> 07:09.373
Brendan Dersh.
He's waiting for you.

07:09.407 --> 07:12.075
And, Aidan, I want Leo
to sit in on the interview.

07:12.110 --> 07:14.211
He's not gonna like
being used like that.

07:14.245 --> 07:17.314
If putting Leo into the interview makes
the husband think he's not a suspect,

07:17.348 --> 07:19.483
and gets us some answers,
that's what we do.

07:19.517 --> 07:22.285
You think it's about the affair?
Get me some proof.

07:25.723 --> 07:27.190
Where did it happen?

07:27.225 --> 07:29.191
She was found
in Mimico.

07:29.226 --> 07:32.328
- Mimico?
- Yeah.

07:32.362 --> 07:35.732
- Did Maya know anybody out that way?
- No.

07:35.766 --> 07:38.100
So, what was she doing
out there?

07:42.305 --> 07:44.273
What are you not telling me?

07:44.307 --> 07:46.942
Mr. Dersh, we think
your wife was seeing someone,

07:46.976 --> 07:50.046
- possibly near where she was killed.
- But we don't know that

07:50.080 --> 07:52.481
- for a fact.
- Yes, you do.

07:52.516 --> 07:54.650
Who was it?

07:54.684 --> 07:57.619
Mr. Dersh,
maybe for right now

07:57.654 --> 08:00.156
you could just start by telling
us were you were last night.

08:00.190 --> 08:01.657
I was at a bar.

08:01.691 --> 08:03.659
- Were you with someone?
- No.

08:03.693 --> 08:05.994
- Did you talk to anyone?
- No!

08:10.800 --> 08:13.635
So, I guess that makes me
a suspect too.

08:19.175 --> 08:21.909
I went to bed early.
I didn't

08:21.944 --> 08:25.280
hear anything, not until the
police showed up this morning.

08:25.314 --> 08:27.707
You said she isn't
from around here?

08:27.827 --> 08:29.740
Never mind!
Have you got something to hide?!

08:29.860 --> 08:31.319
Is there something that you're
hiding in there?!

08:31.439 --> 08:33.001
You get a warrant, or you leave me
the hell alone.

08:33.121 --> 08:35.121
Let me inside this house!
You let me in!

08:35.155 --> 08:37.107
I told you an hour ago,
I don't want any cops in here.

08:37.227 --> 08:38.373
I don't care what you want!

08:38.493 --> 08:40.427
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
excuse me...

08:40.462 --> 08:43.163
- Let go of me! Listen to me...
- Dad!

08:43.198 --> 08:47.935
Dad! It's Poppy! Stop it!

08:47.970 --> 08:49.971
Let's leave and go somewhere
we can talk, OK?

08:50.005 --> 08:51.972
Poppy, what are you doing here?

08:52.006 --> 08:54.007
Is it your mother?
Is there something wrong?

08:54.041 --> 08:57.644
Mom's gone, Dad.
Mom's gone. Come on.

08:57.678 --> 09:00.914
You know, I... I...

09:00.948 --> 09:04.384
Come on. Let's walk.
Let's go. Come on.

09:04.419 --> 09:06.353
I'm gonna take you home,
all right?

09:06.387 --> 09:08.354
Yeah. Yeah,
that's a good idea.

09:08.388 --> 09:11.257
Yeah. All right,
watch your head.

09:11.291 --> 09:12.792
Watch your foot.

09:14.962 --> 09:17.097
He's just tired. I'm gonna take
him home and come right back.

09:17.131 --> 09:20.100
Whatever is going on with your
father, a nap is not gonna fix it.

09:20.134 --> 09:23.103
Hey, I appreciate your concern, but
he's not your patient, all right?

09:23.137 --> 09:25.104
He's just been pulling
a lot of overtime.

09:25.139 --> 09:29.242
Poppy. You know it's more than that.
He needs to see a doctor.

09:29.276 --> 09:31.244
No, he can't.

09:31.278 --> 09:34.347
Please, if you report this,
he will lose his job.

09:36.350 --> 09:38.984
I have a friend -
a specialist.

09:39.019 --> 09:40.986
I'll see if she can do
an assessment.

09:41.021 --> 09:42.988
Unofficially.

09:43.023 --> 09:45.423
OK?

09:45.458 --> 09:46.959
OK.

10:23.006 --> 10:25.120
You still don't even know
his name,

10:25.154 --> 10:28.123
the man Maya was...
seeing?

10:28.157 --> 10:29.625
No, we don't,

10:29.659 --> 10:32.794
and we're not even sure if he's
responsible for her death.

10:32.828 --> 10:36.731
Whoever he is,
he isn't the first.

10:36.765 --> 10:38.934
What do you mean?

10:41.904 --> 10:45.407
Just before we got married,
Maya changed.

10:45.441 --> 10:47.408
I thought it was
cold feet at first.

10:47.443 --> 10:51.979
Looking back, I think there was
something going on then too.

10:54.115 --> 10:56.684
You were working with her
back then.

10:56.718 --> 10:58.218
Yeah.

11:00.221 --> 11:02.222
Anything you want to tell me?

11:07.963 --> 11:09.964
Say the words, Leo.

11:12.834 --> 11:14.335
It was me.

11:17.272 --> 11:19.239
Brendan...

11:19.274 --> 11:20.774
Don't you...

11:31.118 --> 11:33.587
Well, three down,
not one a contender.

11:33.621 --> 11:36.289
You really think you know
Maya's taste in men?

11:36.323 --> 11:38.958
You have your hunches,
I have mine.

11:38.993 --> 11:41.294
All right, next up,
Timothy Lawton.

11:41.328 --> 11:44.998
Oh, I remember him.
He's kinda cute in a nerdy way.

11:55.942 --> 11:57.409
Hello again.

11:57.443 --> 11:58.911
Hi. I'm Detective Aidan Black.

11:58.945 --> 12:01.346
You know Dr. Malone. Sorry
to have to bother you again.

12:01.381 --> 12:03.248
Oh, that's fine. You know,

12:03.282 --> 12:05.751
I just want things to get
back to normal around here.

12:05.785 --> 12:07.753
Do you mind if I ask what
normal is for you,

12:07.787 --> 12:09.754
- Mr. Lawton?
- Um, sure.

12:09.788 --> 12:11.423
I work mostly from home.

12:11.457 --> 12:13.958
I got an online business
in antiques

12:13.993 --> 12:15.994
and collectibles.
And Saturdays are

12:16.029 --> 12:19.431
my shopping days -
estate and garage sales.

12:19.465 --> 12:21.599
Early mornings.
Are you married?

12:21.634 --> 12:24.269
- No.
- Seeing anyone?

12:24.303 --> 12:28.105
No, I...
I don't get out much.

12:28.140 --> 12:30.474
What's that got to do
with anything?

12:30.509 --> 12:32.510
Well, we believe the victim,
Maya Henson,

12:32.545 --> 12:34.546
was visiting somebody
in this neighbourhood.

12:34.580 --> 12:38.416
You know, people often think that the
little things aren't worth mentioning,

12:38.450 --> 12:42.453
but if you saw anything, or heard anything
out of the ordinary, it could help.

12:42.487 --> 12:44.488
I really just mind
my own business.

12:44.523 --> 12:46.357
Is, uh, is there

12:46.391 --> 12:49.326
- anything else, or...?
- Yeah, if you don't mind,

12:49.361 --> 12:51.495
we'd like you to provide us
with a DNA sample.

12:51.530 --> 12:54.331
You're asking everyone?

12:54.366 --> 12:56.633
Of course. It's just
to eliminate suspects.

12:56.668 --> 12:59.169
Um...

12:59.203 --> 13:01.137
I want to help.

13:01.172 --> 13:04.875
But, uh, but with all the news
of wrongful convictions,

13:04.909 --> 13:07.010
you know, I mean, what if
the samples got mislabelled?

13:07.045 --> 13:09.145
That won't happen.
We'll cross you off the list

13:09.180 --> 13:11.147
and destroy the sample
when we close the case.

13:11.182 --> 13:15.685
Still, I think I should talk to a
lawyer before I agree to that.

13:15.719 --> 13:18.721
Completely understand.
That's your right.

13:18.755 --> 13:21.757
You have yourself a good afternoon.
Thank you.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.931
You didn't ask anyone else
for a sample.

13:28.966 --> 13:31.267
No one got me curious enough
to see if they'd say no.

13:31.302 --> 13:34.770
I'll have Poppy check him out.

13:34.805 --> 13:36.271
Everything OK?

13:36.306 --> 13:39.609
Yeah. I need you
to drop me off at St. Stephen's.

13:39.643 --> 13:41.811
There's something I gotta do.

13:43.981 --> 13:47.316
Mr. Wisnefski, can you tell me
which one of these is a tool?

13:51.921 --> 13:53.888
Well...

13:59.562 --> 14:02.731
OK. Now,
which is a utensil?

14:02.765 --> 14:06.534
Well...

14:06.568 --> 14:08.036
Shit!

14:08.070 --> 14:12.240
This gets out, my father's
30-year career is over,

14:12.274 --> 14:13.742
thanks to you.

14:13.776 --> 14:16.911
Poppy, your father is
showing signs

14:16.946 --> 14:19.247
of advancing dementia.

14:19.281 --> 14:21.649
If he makes a serious mistake
on the job,

14:21.683 --> 14:26.420
if someone gets hurt,
imagine the consequences.

14:26.455 --> 14:28.756
Look, I know you were worried
about him too.

14:28.790 --> 14:30.924
- I could see it on your face.
- No, I didn't know!

14:30.959 --> 14:34.828
And this test doesn't mean
anything. He's good at his job.

14:34.863 --> 14:38.142
What the hell is going on here?
Is this your doing?

14:38.262 --> 14:40.801
- She said he needed an assessment.
- What?

14:40.835 --> 14:42.302
You're Vince's partner.

14:42.336 --> 14:44.672
You must have known
about his condition.

14:48.409 --> 14:52.379
Look, all I know is the guy's
got eight months to go

14:52.413 --> 14:54.548
before he can retire
with his head held up high.

14:54.582 --> 14:57.217
You take that away from him,
you are gonna kill him.

14:57.251 --> 15:00.220
- He's a danger on the job.
- I have it under control!

15:00.254 --> 15:03.089
From where I'm standing,
no, you don't.

15:18.672 --> 15:20.639
Are these the suspects
from near the scene?

15:20.674 --> 15:23.442
- Yeah.
- Who do you like?

15:23.476 --> 15:26.813
This guy. Tim Lawton.

15:26.847 --> 15:29.281
- We have any proof?
- He's single,

15:29.316 --> 15:32.050
he lives near
where we found the body, but...

15:32.085 --> 15:34.587
mostly, I just don't like him.

15:34.621 --> 15:36.755
Do we have enough
for a warrant?

15:36.789 --> 15:39.458
Not yet.

15:39.492 --> 15:42.361
Mr. Dersh.
How can I help you?

15:42.395 --> 15:43.995
I have something to tell you.

15:46.833 --> 15:50.736
- What's this?
- Jewelry. Maya kept bringing home all this

15:50.770 --> 15:53.071
new stuff
over the last few weeks...

15:53.106 --> 15:56.808
said she got it from an online collector.
But the thing is, when I checked

15:56.843 --> 16:01.178
her credit card statement,
there was only one purchase.

16:01.213 --> 16:03.914
So, maybe you can tell me
where she got the rest.

16:03.949 --> 16:06.083
Where did she buy
the first one from?

16:06.118 --> 16:08.720
Lawton Antiquities.

16:23.268 --> 16:25.269
Mr. Lawton,
it's the police!

16:28.606 --> 16:32.276
Mr. Lawton, I have a warrant to
conduct a search of the premises!

16:34.945 --> 16:36.446
OK, open it up.

16:47.392 --> 16:49.293
I walked through
the whole house. It's

16:49.327 --> 16:52.228
beyond neat, like he doesn't
really live here.

16:52.263 --> 16:54.230
These are the only signs
of life, and they're all

16:54.265 --> 16:58.067
to sell to other people.
No art of his own,

16:58.102 --> 17:00.436
no plants, no family photos.

17:00.470 --> 17:03.639
You see his clothes?
All identical.

17:03.674 --> 17:05.809
This guy lives for control.

17:07.810 --> 17:09.779
It's like he's playing a part,

17:09.813 --> 17:12.948
keeping up appearances.

17:12.982 --> 17:15.483
All these curtains closed...

17:15.519 --> 17:17.819
You think
we spooked him before?

17:17.854 --> 17:19.555
Has he run?

17:19.589 --> 17:21.624
Maybe, but there's no sign

17:21.657 --> 17:23.892
that Maya was ever
inside the house.

17:23.926 --> 17:26.728
No sign
of a murder weapon, no...

17:26.762 --> 17:29.564
- What?
- Look.

17:29.598 --> 17:32.767
- One's missing.
- The poker.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.769
What was the prelim
on the murder weapon?

17:34.804 --> 17:37.572
Something with heft and a sharp point?
So, where is it?

17:37.606 --> 17:39.708
Good question.

18:01.029 --> 18:03.030
Where does this second wire go?

18:14.242 --> 18:16.076
This is interesting.

18:18.747 --> 18:20.213
Huh.

18:20.248 --> 18:23.250
I don't have a good feeling
about this.

18:41.835 --> 18:44.704
Hey.

18:44.738 --> 18:46.739
What's your name?

19:15.119 --> 19:17.120
Is it too bright?

19:28.492 --> 19:30.015
Do you remember me?

19:30.888 --> 19:32.869
I'm Dr. Malone.

19:32.903 --> 19:35.404
Can you tell me your name?

19:39.180 --> 19:42.678
I realize this must be
overwhelming for you.

19:44.747 --> 19:47.149
Are you frightened?

19:49.119 --> 19:51.087
You're safe.

19:51.121 --> 19:53.622
The man who locked you up
can't get you here.

19:57.794 --> 19:59.961
It's just to protect you.

19:59.996 --> 20:01.797
Where is he?

20:01.831 --> 20:05.067
We don't know
where Tim Lawton is.

20:05.101 --> 20:07.069
But we'll find him.

20:07.103 --> 20:09.605
He's safe?

20:11.974 --> 20:13.609
Thank you.

20:13.643 --> 20:15.643
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

20:25.688 --> 20:29.424
- Any progress with the name?
- Well, we know she's not a relative,

20:29.458 --> 20:32.117
so we're looking at missing girls
to see if we can find a match.

20:32.237 --> 20:34.995
She's malnourished, basically
living in a prison cell.

20:35.030 --> 20:38.433
- Why does she even care about his safety?
- Stockholm Syndrome?

20:38.467 --> 20:42.570
Possibly.
Her survival, her identity,

20:42.605 --> 20:44.905
would all have been linked
to Tim Lawton.

20:44.940 --> 20:47.241
Yeah, like kids who were
abused and still love the adults

20:47.275 --> 20:49.009
who were abusing them.

20:49.044 --> 20:51.912
This girl couldn't risk
alienating the only person

20:51.947 --> 20:53.614
she had in her life, so

20:53.648 --> 20:56.717
she formed an attachment
that will be very hard to break.

20:56.752 --> 20:58.986
How long does it take
to create that kind of bond?

20:59.020 --> 21:01.655
It can take as little
as a few days,

21:01.689 --> 21:05.024
but this girl's body language
and mistrust of others

21:05.059 --> 21:07.994
makes me think that she's been
isolated much longer than that.

21:08.028 --> 21:10.697
- Might help with IDing her.
- Mm-hmm.

21:10.732 --> 21:12.699
Well, I've narrowed it down
to nine girls matching

21:12.734 --> 21:14.987
her general description, missing
two to six years.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.384
Six years...

21:16.504 --> 21:18.605
All right, good news:

21:18.640 --> 21:20.907
We have someone who may be able
to identify the girl...

21:20.941 --> 21:23.008
the family's lawyer.

21:23.042 --> 21:26.011
Isabelle Saunders, 19.
Abducted on her way home

21:26.045 --> 21:28.013
from school in Brantford
four years ago.

21:28.047 --> 21:30.482
Her parents are understandably
eager to see her.

21:30.516 --> 21:33.485
- What makes you so sure it's her?
- Left kneecap, shaped like a U.

21:33.519 --> 21:36.071
It's in the description
you've been circulating.

21:36.191 --> 21:39.124
Even if this girl is
who you say she is,

21:39.159 --> 21:42.160
she's a key individual in the
investigation of Maya Henson's murder.

21:42.194 --> 21:45.229
This girl has spent years
in captivity.

21:45.264 --> 21:48.065
God knows what kind of
psychological and physical abuse

21:48.100 --> 21:50.568
she's suffered. Finally,
the police stumble upon her...

21:50.603 --> 21:53.438
completely by accident,
by the way - and now what?

21:53.472 --> 21:56.540
- Now you want to implicate her in a crime?
- We just want to talk to her.

21:56.574 --> 21:58.542
What I hear from the hospital
staff is she's half catatonic.

21:58.576 --> 22:01.913
You want to talk to her, fine, but
when she is ready and not before.

22:01.947 --> 22:04.916
- It's a little more complicated than that.
- Fire away. I love complicated.

22:04.950 --> 22:07.451
The girl was found in
possession of the murder weapon.

22:07.485 --> 22:10.288
She'd drawn a picture
of the body.

22:10.322 --> 22:12.423
Oh. Oh, OK, I got it.

22:12.457 --> 22:14.625
So, Isabelle somehow

22:14.659 --> 22:17.628
magically killed a woman
from behind a locked door.

22:17.662 --> 22:19.630
The point is, we don't know.
And when we don't know,

22:19.664 --> 22:22.098
we act in the interest
of protecting everyone.

22:22.133 --> 22:24.368
Inspector Caligra,

22:24.402 --> 22:26.403
you really don't want headlines
about how you're

22:26.438 --> 22:28.405
re-victimizing
a traumatized girl.

22:28.440 --> 22:32.242
We don't care about headlines.
This is our call.

22:32.276 --> 22:34.610
No, she's right, Aidan.

22:34.645 --> 22:37.413
Holding her would
look terrible.

22:37.448 --> 22:42.219
All I want is to have Isabelle
released to her family.

22:42.253 --> 22:44.888
They've been waiting a long time
to see their daughter again.

22:44.922 --> 22:48.123
You can talk to her
all you want, but first she has

22:48.158 --> 22:49.659
to go home.

22:54.598 --> 22:56.599
All those years
in that basement,

22:56.633 --> 22:59.001
the sensory overload alone
must be crippling.

22:59.035 --> 23:02.171
- She's not ready for this.
- Neither are they.

23:02.205 --> 23:06.242
The whole family is gonna
need counselling.

23:06.276 --> 23:08.744
But she's not
diagnosably mentally ill,

23:08.778 --> 23:11.146
and her family wants her
released, so,

23:11.181 --> 23:13.782
unless you want
to arrest her...

23:16.953 --> 23:20.522
I'll get 24-hour surveillance
put on her house.

23:29.632 --> 23:32.401
Hey, it's my little girl.

23:34.404 --> 23:35.937
How was school today?

23:35.971 --> 23:37.705
Relax,

23:37.739 --> 23:40.208
I'm just messing with you.
I'm fine - for now.

23:40.242 --> 23:42.676
Oh, yeah, that's hilarious.
You're real funny, Dad.

23:42.711 --> 23:47.916
Listen, I am doing everything
I can to fix this. OK?

23:50.419 --> 23:52.386
I don't think so. I...

23:52.421 --> 23:54.889
I talked to the shrink.
I know what I've got.

23:54.923 --> 23:58.893
No, so, we'll find
another doctor, right?

23:58.927 --> 24:01.228
OK, look... look at you.

24:01.262 --> 24:05.365
You are totally fine right now.
So, you go to your sergeant,

24:05.400 --> 24:09.202
right, you ask for a desk job, you
tell him you want a desk job,

24:09.237 --> 24:11.405
and you coast through the next
eight months, no problem.

24:11.439 --> 24:12.739
Poppy. Poppy.

24:12.773 --> 24:14.741
No, we need to fight this,
Dad. This is not right...

24:14.775 --> 24:17.577
Poppy!

24:17.611 --> 24:20.580
I've been fighting this,
you know?

24:20.614 --> 24:24.117
For a long time.
Ray's been helping me.

24:26.454 --> 24:28.154
I'm just not winning.

24:28.188 --> 24:29.823
Dad...

24:29.857 --> 24:33.092
Like... like I...

24:33.126 --> 24:36.596
I always tell the rookies,
you know, if... if...

24:36.630 --> 24:40.700
if you can't do the job right,
then just don't do it.

24:44.904 --> 24:47.206
If I can accept this,

24:47.240 --> 24:49.875
so can you.

24:49.909 --> 24:50.443
Right?

24:50.445 --> 24:53.212
Right?

24:53.246 --> 24:55.214
- Tell me.
- OK.?

24:55.248 --> 24:57.549
OK, dad.

24:57.584 --> 25:00.085
That's my girl.
That's my girl.

25:02.088 --> 25:03.589
I love you, Dad.

25:11.464 --> 25:15.400
Morningside and Ellesmere.
Got it. Thanks.

25:15.434 --> 25:18.470
Tim Lawton's car just showed up.
Ident's going over it now.

25:18.504 --> 25:21.406
I mean, Maya was smart.
She worked with disturbed people

25:21.440 --> 25:23.574
all the time. Why didn't she see
through this guy?

25:23.609 --> 25:26.411
He had his act down.
I mean, there was no reason

25:26.445 --> 25:28.713
for Maya to doubt that he was
exactly who he said he was...

25:28.747 --> 25:32.717
an antique dealer who thought that
she was attractive and interesting.

25:32.751 --> 25:35.285
This was at the front for you.

25:35.320 --> 25:36.787
Oh, juvenile

25:36.822 --> 25:38.656
psych records on Lawton.

25:38.690 --> 25:40.658
But why go after

25:40.692 --> 25:43.594
Maya at all when he had a girl
locked up in his basement?

25:43.629 --> 25:45.897
Well, someone like Maya might
help him feel normal.

25:45.931 --> 25:47.931
Except he wasn't normal.

25:47.965 --> 25:50.634
Father died when Lawton was 10,
mother worked nights

25:50.668 --> 25:54.738
as a cleaner at a private school
till it closed down in the '80s.

25:54.772 --> 25:58.842
She was investigated for
physical abuse and confinement

25:58.876 --> 26:02.012
of Tim, but committed suicide
before it went to court.

26:02.047 --> 26:04.881
Got some audio here.

26:04.916 --> 26:07.651
Tell me about
"the box," Tim.

26:07.685 --> 26:09.653
Why did your mother put you
in there?

26:09.687 --> 26:11.755
Just,
if I was bad.

26:11.789 --> 26:16.626
I couldn't see if it was light
or dark outside, so I don't know

26:16.661 --> 26:21.597
for how long.
I still dream about it.

26:21.631 --> 26:23.399
Do you think that will stop?

26:23.434 --> 26:25.668
I'd like to help you
make it stop.

26:25.702 --> 26:28.771
Something tells me
she didn't make it stop.

26:28.805 --> 26:31.974
So, Tim Lawton was locked up,

26:32.008 --> 26:33.976
and abused physically

26:34.010 --> 26:35.978
and emotionally
throughout his youth.

26:36.012 --> 26:39.615
He can't have a relationship
unless he's in total control.

26:39.649 --> 26:41.717
It's not about sex;
It's about power.

26:41.751 --> 26:44.152
Now I see it.

26:44.187 --> 26:45.888
Maya.

26:47.891 --> 26:51.126
She liked the broken ones -
like Brendan. Always thought

26:51.160 --> 26:53.128
- she could fix 'em.
- All right, so,

26:53.162 --> 26:55.730
now we've taken away Lawton's
power. What'll that do to him?

26:55.764 --> 27:00.202
He'll be under extreme stress. He'll
need to regain control at any cost.

27:00.236 --> 27:02.370
Which makes him
more dangerous than ever.

27:02.405 --> 27:05.240
Black.

27:07.577 --> 27:10.544
Yeah, just follow at a safe
distance and keep me posted.

27:10.579 --> 27:14.916
Isabelle Saunders has just left
her parents' house alone.

27:14.950 --> 27:18.185
I think I know
where she's going.

27:31.099 --> 27:33.567
Isabelle?

27:33.602 --> 27:36.770
It's me, Dr. Malone.

27:43.210 --> 27:45.211
All my stuff is gone.

27:47.214 --> 27:49.349
It's evidence.

27:49.383 --> 27:51.718
The police had to take it away.

27:59.993 --> 28:02.362
What about
your parents' house?

28:02.396 --> 28:04.864
You still have things
of your own there.

28:04.898 --> 28:08.868
They're not my real
family. Tim is my family.

28:08.902 --> 28:12.138
Is that what he told you?

28:12.173 --> 28:14.240
Tim called my parents,

28:14.275 --> 28:16.241
and they said
they didn't want me anymore.

28:16.276 --> 28:19.879
He even drove me
over there, and I saw.

28:19.913 --> 28:22.081
They were unloading groceries.

28:22.115 --> 28:24.917
They weren't crying.

28:27.220 --> 28:30.222
Tim said it proved
they didn't care about me.

28:30.256 --> 28:31.757
Isabelle,

28:31.792 --> 28:34.393
Tim is gone.

28:34.427 --> 28:35.894
He left you here.

28:35.928 --> 28:38.096
- He is not coming back.
- You don't know anything

28:38.130 --> 28:39.631
about it.

28:41.634 --> 28:46.137
He's always looking out for me.
He only cares about me.

28:49.709 --> 28:52.310
You said Tim drove you
to your parents' house?

28:52.344 --> 28:55.346
He took me on car rides
when I was good.

28:55.380 --> 28:58.649
Where else
did he take you?

28:58.684 --> 29:01.519
We looked at a school.

29:01.553 --> 29:04.022
He said I could go
to school someday.

29:04.056 --> 29:06.857
Do you want to go to school?

29:06.891 --> 29:10.628
Tim says I'm not...
ready yet.

29:10.662 --> 29:12.830
But I will be.

29:12.864 --> 29:15.833
He told me I'm the fastest learner
of all the girls he ever met.

29:15.867 --> 29:17.702
There were other girls?

29:17.736 --> 29:20.705
I was the only one
he ever brought home.

29:20.739 --> 29:23.107
With me, he doesn't
need them anymore.

29:23.141 --> 29:26.543
I take care of him so he doesn't
have to hurt anyone else.

29:28.546 --> 29:30.047
That's why I've stayed.

29:31.225 --> 29:32.934
Isabelle,

29:34.418 --> 29:37.054
you stayed because you were
a prisoner.

29:37.088 --> 29:38.588
You don't understand.

29:44.262 --> 29:45.762
What is it?

29:49.066 --> 29:51.234
Isabelle.

29:51.269 --> 29:53.770
What aren't you telling me?

30:06.283 --> 30:08.517
Tim didn't know about it
at first.

30:08.551 --> 30:13.188
I just wanted to feel the grass
under my feet.

30:13.222 --> 30:15.190
But he found out.

30:15.224 --> 30:17.626
That was a bad day.

30:20.363 --> 30:24.900
I only went out when it was
dark and no people were around.

30:24.934 --> 30:27.469
Were you out two nights ago?

30:30.372 --> 30:32.607
Yeah.

30:32.641 --> 30:35.710
Is that when you drew the picture
of the lady on the ground?

30:38.747 --> 30:40.215
Isabelle,

30:40.249 --> 30:42.851
what happened to her?

30:42.885 --> 30:44.885
I told her to leave.

30:47.956 --> 30:49.957
And then I hit her.

31:08.443 --> 31:10.410
Where you headed?

31:10.445 --> 31:12.279
To Barrie.

31:12.314 --> 31:14.281
Your parents know
you're hitchhiking?

31:14.316 --> 31:16.616
I'm careful.

31:18.619 --> 31:20.620
You're running away?

31:20.655 --> 31:22.789
I've been a youth pastor
for many years now,

31:22.824 --> 31:24.289
and I know the look.

31:24.324 --> 31:27.760
I'm going to my grandmother's.

31:27.794 --> 31:29.928
It's dangerous out there,
you know?

31:29.963 --> 31:33.098
OK, hop in.
I'm going past Barrie.

31:33.132 --> 31:36.469
I'll drop you off.
You hungry?

31:36.503 --> 31:39.137
There's a nice
hamburger joint up there.

31:39.172 --> 31:42.674
I can buy you some lunch, you
can decide if I'm trustworthy.

31:42.708 --> 31:46.011
Or are you one of those
vegetarian kids?

31:48.581 --> 31:50.916
No. I like hamburgers.

31:50.950 --> 31:52.450
Good.

31:56.589 --> 31:58.256
Put your seatbelt on.

32:04.083 --> 32:06.296
Isabelle Saunders
just confessed to the murder.

32:06.330 --> 32:09.299
She's trying to protect Lawton.
I don't believe she did it.

32:09.333 --> 32:12.235
I don't either, but we're
gonna hold her in custody.

32:12.269 --> 32:15.038
- What?
- Amber Alert.

32:15.073 --> 32:17.107
Jenna Wahl, 16.

32:17.141 --> 32:19.542
She went missing. They thought
it was a classic teen runaway,

32:19.577 --> 32:21.777
but then a cashier reported
seeing her at a burger joint.

32:21.812 --> 32:23.779
That's from
their security camera.

32:23.814 --> 32:27.584
- Oh, no. We've got to get Isabelle to talk.
- Every cop in the city's

32:27.618 --> 32:29.586
looking for this guy,
and he takes another girl?

32:29.620 --> 32:31.087
How crazy is he?

32:31.122 --> 32:33.356
Extreme stress makes
people act out...

32:33.390 --> 32:36.226
people with anger issues go
into a rage,

32:36.260 --> 32:38.227
people with drinking problems
drink to excess.

32:38.261 --> 32:40.730
And deviant control freaks
find new victims to abduct.

32:40.764 --> 32:42.732
Mmhmm. Well, find this one.

32:48.805 --> 32:50.773
I just gotta go
into this place real quick.

32:50.807 --> 32:52.775
- I'll wait for you here.
- Are you kidding?

32:52.809 --> 32:55.210
No way is it safe
out here for you.

32:55.245 --> 32:57.212
You got a lot to learn, Jenna.

32:57.247 --> 32:59.214
Yeah, but I was thinking
I should go home.

32:59.249 --> 33:02.451
My parents will be looking for me.
That's a good idea.

33:02.485 --> 33:04.953
But first you should
come in with me.

33:04.987 --> 33:06.955
Real quick, just to be safe.

33:06.989 --> 33:10.125
And then I'll take you back home.
You got my word on that.

33:18.300 --> 33:20.068
Ugh! Ugh!

33:20.102 --> 33:23.471
You'll like me, you'll see.
When you get to know me better.

33:23.505 --> 33:26.541
No! Please. Please!

33:29.678 --> 33:31.312
Please let me go!

33:31.346 --> 33:33.113
Help!

33:33.148 --> 33:34.615
Help me!

33:34.650 --> 33:37.418
I don't want
to talk to you anymore.

33:37.452 --> 33:39.820
You want to hurt Tim.

33:39.854 --> 33:42.923
And you want to protect him?

33:42.957 --> 33:45.592
Can you tell me why?

33:45.626 --> 33:47.594
You think I'm stupid.

33:47.628 --> 33:50.430
You think he fooled me,

33:50.464 --> 33:53.300
but I KNOW he loves me.

33:53.334 --> 33:55.435
Your parents love you.

33:55.469 --> 33:57.104
You had friends who loved you,

33:57.138 --> 33:59.639
and you will have friends again
when you go back home.

34:01.642 --> 34:04.377
Tim says the only one
who loves me is him.

34:04.412 --> 34:05.912
Isabelle...

34:11.819 --> 34:15.121
that was a lie Tim told you.

34:15.155 --> 34:19.958
He left you
in that basement alone.

34:19.993 --> 34:22.161
Because you scared him.

34:25.165 --> 34:29.001
He wants you to take the blame
for murdering that woman.

34:29.036 --> 34:32.038
You think he misses you?

34:34.907 --> 34:38.744
What if I told you that Tim has
already taken another girl?

34:41.348 --> 34:42.848
He wouldn't do that.

34:49.889 --> 34:52.489
Isabelle,

34:52.524 --> 34:56.427
stop protecting someone
who doesn't care about you.

35:02.935 --> 35:06.137
He said he was gonna
come back for me.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.733
But he didn't come back.

35:14.280 --> 35:18.583
Isabelle, you didn't hit
anybody, did you?

35:21.953 --> 35:24.955
I heard Tim talking to that lady
on the phone a couple times.

35:27.558 --> 35:30.494
She came over to see him,
but I was outside.

35:32.497 --> 35:35.732
I tried to make her go away.
Are you OK?

35:35.767 --> 35:37.734
I told you,
we don't want you here!

35:37.769 --> 35:40.370
But she followed me.

35:40.405 --> 35:43.139
My name is Maya.

35:43.174 --> 35:45.241
Tim came up.

35:50.448 --> 35:52.148
He killed her.

35:54.452 --> 35:57.586
So she wouldn't tell anyone
about me.

35:57.621 --> 36:00.256
You see what you m...
what you made me do?

36:00.291 --> 36:02.025
Are you proud of yourself?

36:05.462 --> 36:08.097
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

36:08.132 --> 36:10.533
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

36:12.536 --> 36:14.002
Do you know

36:14.037 --> 36:19.542
where Tim could be now?
Where he's taken this girl?

36:25.816 --> 36:27.316
Where he took me first.

36:30.386 --> 36:32.321
He took me to school.

36:40.763 --> 36:43.165
Tim's mother, you said
she was a cleaner

36:43.199 --> 36:45.199
at a school
that closed down, right?

36:48.371 --> 36:51.706
Everton College.
Closed in 1987.

36:51.741 --> 36:53.742
Still abandoned.

36:55.878 --> 36:57.879
That's where he is.

37:27.040 --> 37:29.074
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:29.109 --> 37:31.076
- What?
- Wait here. Watch the doors.

37:31.111 --> 37:33.078
Any sign of Lawton or the girl,
you just buzz us.

37:33.113 --> 37:35.080
Aidan, I need
to be a part of this.

37:35.115 --> 37:38.183
You are a part of this, Leo,
but I need level heads in there.

37:38.218 --> 37:41.887
So, just watch the door
and let us do our job.

38:34.322 --> 38:36.423
If you're good, Jenna,

38:36.457 --> 38:38.090
I can be really

38:38.125 --> 38:41.594
nice to you. It's so much better
if you're good, Jenna.

38:41.629 --> 38:43.930
- Please...
- Oh.

38:43.964 --> 38:46.499
Please, please stop.

38:46.534 --> 38:48.501
- Stop it.
- I'll teach you how,

38:48.536 --> 38:50.503
- OK?
- Please...

38:50.538 --> 38:52.505
- But you gotta be positive.
- Please.

38:52.540 --> 38:55.507
- Hey, you gotta believe in us.
- Please.

38:55.542 --> 38:57.810
You gotta believe in us, OK?

38:57.844 --> 39:00.479
You gotta believe in us.

39:04.184 --> 39:06.652
Police! Don't move!

39:09.423 --> 39:12.558
Drop the scissors, Lawton,
and move away from the girl.

39:12.592 --> 39:15.627
- No, you... you got this wrong, officer.
- Do it now!

39:15.662 --> 39:18.630
I found this girl, and she was
trespassing, all right?

39:18.665 --> 39:20.966
On private property.
I was gonna call you guys.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.602
This is your last warning.

39:28.274 --> 39:31.176
If you think I won't pull
this trigger, you're wrong.

39:33.179 --> 39:35.880
I'll kill her.

39:35.914 --> 39:38.749
- Ow!
- Drop it!

39:38.784 --> 39:41.386
You don't understand.

39:41.420 --> 39:42.887
I understand.

39:42.921 --> 39:47.157
Just give me an excuse to put
you down right here and now.

39:47.192 --> 39:48.693
Drop it!

39:51.630 --> 39:54.832
Get down on your knees!
You don't understand.

39:54.867 --> 39:57.267
On your knees!

39:57.302 --> 39:59.203
All the way down!

39:59.237 --> 40:01.338
Hands behind your back!

40:01.373 --> 40:04.841
Don't move. Don't move!

40:04.876 --> 40:08.778

Hey! Back off.

you didn't let me go in there.
