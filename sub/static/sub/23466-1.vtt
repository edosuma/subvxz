00:12.000 --> 00:14.367
[wind whistling]

00:28.967 --> 00:32.567
[helicopter blades whirring]

00:45.133 --> 00:48.133
[faint voices murmuring]

00:50.267 --> 00:51.333
David?

00:54.400 --> 00:55.500
David!

00:59.667 --> 01:02.167
They're coming for me.

01:02.167 --> 01:04.333
[transport rumbling]

01:12.567 --> 01:16.667
[radio chatter transmitting]

01:19.333 --> 01:23.133
[dog barking]

01:24.333 --> 01:25.967
[dog barking]

01:31.300 --> 01:34.467
Get all the women and children
upstairs, right now.

01:34.467 --> 01:36.133
Go on.

01:36.133 --> 01:39.667
-I gotta go find Judy.
-Go, Cyrus.

01:45.233 --> 01:47.067
Ready for the go command, sir.

01:52.233 --> 01:55.233
Showtime,
showtime, showtime.

02:01.467 --> 02:02.700
[rifle clicks]

02:04.800 --> 02:08.367
Listen up. No one do anything
stupid. I'm gonna go out there,

02:08.367 --> 02:10.633
talk to them, work this out.
All right? Go on.

02:23.833 --> 02:26.067
[agents]
Go, go, go, go!

02:38.533 --> 02:40.667
[sighs] All right.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.700
[helicopter blades whirring]

02:53.200 --> 02:57.567
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Calm down! Please, stop!

02:57.567 --> 02:59.200
Get your hands in the air
and get on the ground!

02:59.200 --> 03:01.767
There are women and children
in here!

03:01.767 --> 03:03.133
[gunshot echoes]

03:44.067 --> 03:45.067
-[whispers] Get up.
-[gasps]

03:45.067 --> 03:47.133
[chuckles]

03:48.067 --> 03:50.300
-Okay.
-Let's go.

03:53.733 --> 03:56.567
[sighs]

03:56.567 --> 03:57.633
Thank you.

04:03.067 --> 04:05.967
[sighs]

04:05.967 --> 04:07.233
Here we go.

04:09.067 --> 04:11.233
[David]  I didn't wanna
wake your mama.

04:12.467 --> 04:15.067
She was up all night
with Bobbie Lane.

04:15.067 --> 04:17.267
-I thought you just forgot.
-Me?

04:17.267 --> 04:20.533
Forget? Never.

04:22.667 --> 04:24.400
[Cyrus panting]

04:31.700 --> 04:33.400
[panting]

04:33.400 --> 04:36.567
-Can we stop?
-Cyrus.

04:36.567 --> 04:38.333
That was terrible.

04:38.333 --> 04:40.233
You gotta pace yourself.

04:40.233 --> 04:42.133
You came out way too hot.

04:42.133 --> 04:44.333
Bossy, bossy.

04:44.333 --> 04:46.733
Yeah, well...
when I was your age,

04:46.733 --> 04:49.800
I didn't have a dad around
to be bossing me.

04:49.800 --> 04:53.067
Be grateful. Come on.

04:53.067 --> 04:55.333
[Cyrus] Come on.
Go a little faster.

04:55.333 --> 04:58.233
All right.
Just a little faster.

05:03.067 --> 05:04.700
[voices murmuring]

05:04.700 --> 05:07.233
This morning I woke up
with this funny feeling

05:07.233 --> 05:11.300
right here in my gut.

05:11.300 --> 05:13.933
And it took me some time
to put a name on that sucker.

05:13.933 --> 05:16.167
I thought I ate something bad,
but that wasn't it.

05:16.167 --> 05:19.100
[scattered laughter]

05:19.100 --> 05:21.200
Then I realized what it was.

05:23.533 --> 05:24.633
Joy.

05:28.600 --> 05:31.867
But how could that be, out here
in the middle of nowhere?

05:31.867 --> 05:34.933
No running water, no  stuff.

05:36.233 --> 05:38.600
In this rickety old house...

05:38.600 --> 05:42.333
out here in the middle
of the Texas plains? Joy?

05:43.567 --> 05:45.633
[sighs]

05:45.633 --> 05:49.667
See, I don't know about you,
but I wasn't raised out of joy.

05:49.667 --> 05:52.967
I didn't have much joy
growing up.

05:52.967 --> 05:55.233
But now, after all this time...

05:55.233 --> 05:58.333
how is it
a man can find joy  here?

06:04.067 --> 06:05.333
Wayne.

06:06.667 --> 06:10.067
You got your law degree
from Harvard.

06:10.067 --> 06:12.533
Was that enough
for you, Wayne?

06:12.533 --> 06:13.567
Nope.

06:13.567 --> 06:17.333
No. Mike.

06:17.333 --> 06:22.133
You ran your own pool company.
Was that enough?

06:22.133 --> 06:23.133
Sure wasn't.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.733
"Sure wasn't."

06:29.300 --> 06:30.567
[chuckles]

06:32.533 --> 06:35.800
[David] Steve.
Professor of theology.

06:36.933 --> 06:39.367
Amazing.

06:39.367 --> 06:41.400
You lived with your wife, Judy,
in paradise

06:41.400 --> 06:42.967
on the beach in Hawaii.

06:42.967 --> 06:46.467
-Enough?
-Not even close.

06:46.467 --> 06:51.167
Not even close!
See, that's the big trick.

06:51.167 --> 06:54.267
It's never enough,
no matter what you do.

06:54.267 --> 06:58.600
So how is it
a man can find joy here?

06:59.333 --> 07:00.700
I'll tell you.

07:04.600 --> 07:08.800
Joy doesn't come
from having something,

07:08.800 --> 07:12.067
or being something.

07:12.067 --> 07:13.833
It comes from  becoming.

07:16.533 --> 07:20.333
Becoming more
than you are today.

07:24.700 --> 07:28.800
All right.
Let's open 'em up.

07:28.800 --> 07:31.933
[man]  Every day I wake up,
I see a world
that's falling apart.

07:31.933 --> 07:35.200
-Things aren't that bad.
-Maybe not for you, but--

07:35.200 --> 07:37.467
-but for me, it's over.
-Sir, calm down.

07:37.467 --> 07:39.300
Don't tell me
to calm down!

07:39.300 --> 07:41.100
[trainee] Sorry.
I just wanna help you.

07:41.100 --> 07:43.567
[man]  Help me?
There's no way out of this.

07:43.567 --> 07:46.067
We're running out of time here.
If you don't come out soon,

07:46.067 --> 07:49.700
-they're going to go in there--
-[gunshot blasts]

07:49.700 --> 07:50.800
Thanks, Tim.

07:54.767 --> 07:58.133
-[trainee] What happened?
-What happened?

07:58.133 --> 08:01.667
Killed himself.
And his kids.

08:04.833 --> 08:07.500
Contain.

08:07.500 --> 08:10.600
Open communication
to de-escalate tension.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.333
Stall for time,
lower expectations,

08:13.333 --> 08:16.200
lower the pulse.

08:16.200 --> 08:20.067
But the real key
is to  listen.

08:20.067 --> 08:23.900
You gotta think if someone's
talking to an FBI negotiator,

08:23.900 --> 08:26.233
they're having the worst day
of their lives.

08:26.233 --> 08:29.467
And your voice,
it might be the only thing
keeping them alive.

08:29.467 --> 08:34.800
So remember,
how you say something is
as important as what you say.

08:34.800 --> 08:38.833
-[door clicks]
-That's all for today.

08:43.533 --> 08:45.967
How's the new batch
of trainees?

08:45.967 --> 08:48.433
None of them
is as instantly brilliant
as I was.

08:48.433 --> 08:51.167
[laughing] God help us all.

08:51.167 --> 08:53.867
-Got your go bag with you?
-Always.

08:53.867 --> 08:57.267
-Where you sending me?
-Ruby Ridge. Idaho.

08:57.267 --> 08:59.067
Read up. It's a quagmire.

08:59.067 --> 09:02.400
Mitch Decker and HRT
got out there a few hours ago.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.167
I need you on a plane
as soon as possible.

09:05.167 --> 09:09.100
-Mm. Yes, sir.
-Good luck.

09:09.100 --> 09:12.100
A federal agent has
been shot and killed
in a confrontation

09:12.100 --> 09:14.300
with fugitive Randy Weaver
in north Idaho.

09:14.300 --> 09:16.700
[TV reporter]
Weaver is charged
by the ATF for selling

09:16.700 --> 09:19.433
illegal sawed-off shotguns
to an undercover agent.

09:19.433 --> 09:23.067
When the ATF sent authorities
to Weaver's house
to arrest him,

09:23.067 --> 09:25.667
a federal agent and Weaver's
13-year-old son, Sammy,

09:25.667 --> 09:27.633
were killed
in a brief shootout.

09:27.633 --> 09:30.733
The FBI has now taken
command from the ATF

09:30.733 --> 09:33.200
and has surrounded
the house.

09:36.233 --> 09:39.700
Mitch Decker,
FBI Hostage Rescue Team.
What do we have here?

09:39.700 --> 09:42.833
Cabin's 250 yards up the hill.
Highly fortified.

09:42.833 --> 09:45.300
Inside is Randy Weaver,
his wife, Vicky,

09:45.300 --> 09:48.067
their three daughters
and another adult male,
Kevin Harris.

09:48.067 --> 09:50.833
-[Mitch] What do we know
about Weaver?
-[agent] Former Green Beret,

09:50.833 --> 09:52.800
turned white separatist
and anti-government.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.167
Guy's highly trained
in explosives.

09:56.867 --> 09:58.533
-Have you made contact?
-Negative.

09:58.533 --> 10:00.367
They don't have a phone.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.533
Why haven't you blocked off
these roads?

10:02.533 --> 10:05.400
We have a perimeter.
There's no way the Weavers
can make it that far.

10:05.400 --> 10:08.933
I'm less worried
about them getting out
than those who want to get in.

10:08.933 --> 10:11.500
We're in the middle of
an Aryan Nation stronghold here.

10:11.500 --> 10:14.000
They band together,
decide they don't want us
in their woods,

10:14.000 --> 10:17.433
they got enough firepower
to turn this thing
into a modern-day Alamo.

10:17.433 --> 10:19.900
I need the road
sealed off for one mile out.

10:19.900 --> 10:22.033
Make sure all the barricades
say "ATF" on 'em.

10:22.033 --> 10:24.167
I don't want anyone thinking
we made this mess.

10:32.533 --> 10:34.667
[David]
Hey, where y'all going?

10:34.667 --> 10:37.167
You know I have
a show tonight, right?

10:37.167 --> 10:40.933
McMahon had an extra spot
at the gun show in Austin
tomorrow, so I'll send Paul.

10:40.933 --> 10:43.033
I mean, aren't we waiting
on permits anyways?

10:43.033 --> 10:45.233
Came in a couple of days ago.
We're all set.

10:45.233 --> 10:46.800
Oh.

10:46.800 --> 10:50.200
Hey... try and sell
some of those vests.

10:50.200 --> 10:53.300
-I know they're not moving.
-Have you seen
those vests, David?

10:53.300 --> 10:56.567
I have seen the vests, yeah.
[laughing]

10:56.567 --> 10:58.667
[David] Yes, Wayne,
I've seen them.

10:58.667 --> 11:00.800
-They're pretty ugly.
-The women are proud of 'em,

11:00.800 --> 11:03.667
so just try and move 'em.

11:03.667 --> 11:06.700
And remind Paul we're not
just in it for the money.

11:06.700 --> 11:09.167
There's a lot of lost souls
at those gun shows.

11:09.167 --> 11:11.567
-Mission first.
-Oh.

11:11.567 --> 11:13.800
-All right. See you later.
-Yeah.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.467
We're never gonna move
those vests.

11:15.467 --> 11:16.933
Not a chance.

11:16.933 --> 11:20.300
But you heard the man.
We gotta try.

11:20.300 --> 11:23.367
Maybe Paul can sell them to some
garbage cans on the way home.

11:23.367 --> 11:24.633
[chuckles] At a discount.

11:24.633 --> 11:26.133
[door bangs]

11:32.400 --> 11:34.900
-Steve?
-Yeah.

11:34.900 --> 11:37.767
-Do you got a moment?
-Sure.

11:43.067 --> 11:44.633
What's going on?

11:46.600 --> 11:48.567
I'm pregnant.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.967
-You sure?
-Mm-hmm.

12:19.833 --> 12:23.067
[sniper] I have two armed men
in view. Over.

12:25.167 --> 12:29.300
[sniper on radio]
Repeat, two armed men. Sir?

12:31.300 --> 12:34.100
-Standing by.
-Do you have the shot?
Take it.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.133
Copy that.

12:36.133 --> 12:37.767
Whew.

12:40.900 --> 12:44.267
-[gunshot crackles]
-[grunting]

12:44.267 --> 12:46.333
Get up.

12:46.333 --> 12:50.367
Vicky! Vicky, open the door!

12:50.367 --> 12:52.867
Vicky, open the door!
[grunting]

12:55.567 --> 12:58.067
[gunshot echoes]

12:58.067 --> 13:00.433
-You all right? You okay?
-[moans]

13:03.167 --> 13:04.333
Vicky--!

13:08.433 --> 13:09.733
Hey, hey...

13:13.767 --> 13:16.167
Target eluded fire. Over.

13:19.567 --> 13:20.833
Stand down.

13:28.833 --> 13:32.600
[reporter]  Randy Weaver
has told friends all he wants
is to be left alone.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.567
[reporter 2]
Northern Idaho is a hotbed
for anti-government sentiment.

13:35.567 --> 13:39.500
A vigil of angry supporters
watch the authorities'
every move.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.067
[voices yelling]

13:42.667 --> 13:44.567
[yelling]

13:57.333 --> 14:00.800
What if we brought the APCs
from the north side

14:00.800 --> 14:02.300
to insert the gas
into the cabin?

14:02.300 --> 14:04.100
Would that at least
push him out?

14:04.100 --> 14:06.433
A little premature
for an assault, isn't it?

14:06.433 --> 14:09.933
He's dug in, Gary.
He ain't coming out.

14:09.933 --> 14:13.167
Guys, can you give us
a minute? Thanks.

14:16.533 --> 14:18.633
Mitch, I know he's dug in.

14:18.633 --> 14:20.167
But his son's already dead,

14:20.167 --> 14:23.100
and there's
three more kids in there.

14:23.100 --> 14:25.367
Now do you really want
to engage in close combat

14:25.367 --> 14:27.467
with more children?

14:27.467 --> 14:29.767
What do you propose we do?

14:29.767 --> 14:32.800
Give me a chance.
Let me talk to him.

14:32.800 --> 14:34.633
It's what I'm here for,
isn't it?

14:38.467 --> 14:41.433
-[David] You see Castillo yet?
-[Steve] Nope.

14:41.433 --> 14:45.267
It's kinda hard to play a set
when the drummer
doesn't show up, Steve.

14:45.267 --> 14:48.167
I guess you'll have to figure
something out.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.633
Hey, what's his problem?

14:58.633 --> 14:59.900
Judy's pregnant.

15:01.633 --> 15:02.700
Oh.

15:04.733 --> 15:06.067
Great.

15:10.633 --> 15:12.267
Hey, drummer.

15:12.267 --> 15:13.833
You have anywhere
you gotta be right now?

15:13.833 --> 15:17.267
Uh, I'm not sure. Do I?

15:17.267 --> 15:21.067
Don't look at me.
I'm working.

15:21.067 --> 15:22.900
She's working.

15:22.900 --> 15:25.333
-Guess not. [chuckles]
-Well...

15:25.333 --> 15:28.100
our drummer didn't show up.

15:28.100 --> 15:30.300
Wanna play a set with us?

15:30.300 --> 15:33.600
I don't know.
You guys any good?

15:35.233 --> 15:38.200
Well, let's find out,
shall we?

15:38.200 --> 15:41.300
-All right.
-[cymbal snaps]

15:41.300 --> 15:45.267
-[music playing]
-[voices overlapping]

15:56.067 --> 15:59.133
* Ooh, my little pretty one
My pretty one *

15:59.133 --> 16:02.300
* When you gonna give me
Some time, Sharona? *

16:02.300 --> 16:05.467
* Ooh, you make my motor run
My motor run *

16:05.467 --> 16:08.800
* Got it coming off of the line,
Sharona *

16:08.800 --> 16:11.600
* Never gonna stop, give it up
Such a dirty mind *

16:11.600 --> 16:14.233
* I always get it up
For the touch *

16:14.233 --> 16:20.067
* Of the younger kind
My, my, my, aye-aye, whoo! *

16:20.067 --> 16:22.200
* Ma-ma-ma-my Sharona

16:24.833 --> 16:27.633
[music continues]

16:40.567 --> 16:42.567
So...

16:42.567 --> 16:45.900
it just occurred to me,
I never got your name.

16:45.900 --> 16:48.433
-Thibodeau.
-Thibodeau?

16:48.433 --> 16:50.333
Yeah.

16:50.333 --> 16:54.700
-[bottles clink]
-David Koresh. Pleasure.

16:54.700 --> 16:56.933
[David sighs]

16:56.933 --> 17:00.767
You can tell a lot about a man
by the way he plays his music.

17:00.767 --> 17:02.233
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

17:02.233 --> 17:03.800
What does my playing
say about me?

17:03.800 --> 17:05.433
You play loud and aggressive.

17:05.433 --> 17:08.067
Like you're scared
if you don't make enough noise,

17:08.067 --> 17:10.933
the whole world
might just forget about you.

17:10.933 --> 17:12.467
I see it.

17:15.433 --> 17:18.433
'Cause the whole world
almost forgot about me, too.

17:18.433 --> 17:21.300
-For a little while, at least.
-Yeah? How's that?

17:21.300 --> 17:25.067
When I was a kid,
I couldn't read too hot,
and I stuttered.

17:25.067 --> 17:27.867
Then one day, my mama
comes over and she says,

17:27.867 --> 17:31.100
"I'm gonna put you
in a class for special kids."

17:31.100 --> 17:34.667
And I'm like,
"Wow! This is great!"

17:34.667 --> 17:37.367
And I go to class,
and it  is great.

17:37.367 --> 17:40.467
Finally, no kids picking
on me anymore.

17:40.467 --> 17:43.600
[sighs] Recess comes up,
I walk outside.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.933
This kid comes over
and he shouts, "Hey, look.

17:46.933 --> 17:49.800
Here come all the retards."

17:49.800 --> 17:54.767
And I turn around to see
who he's pointing at.
There's no one there.

17:54.767 --> 17:57.967
[chuckles]

17:57.967 --> 18:01.233
I  was that retard.

18:01.233 --> 18:04.700
-Then it all just switched.
-[fingers snap]

18:04.700 --> 18:05.833
Instant night.

18:08.300 --> 18:13.300
You know, my mom worked nights,
so... I spent a lot of time
by myself.

18:13.300 --> 18:17.333
I remember, one night,
I was like, 12.

18:17.333 --> 18:19.200
And I was standing
at the counter, eating,

18:19.200 --> 18:21.800
and I saw our neighbors
through the blinds.

18:21.800 --> 18:26.467
Sitting in their dining room,
just... just eating together.

18:26.467 --> 18:28.533
-Mm.
-And I don't know,

18:28.533 --> 18:32.533
it just-- it just pissed me off.
[chuckles]

18:32.533 --> 18:35.100
So I opened up
all the windows and just...

18:35.100 --> 18:39.867
played my drums
as loud as I could.
Just wanted to ruin their night.

18:41.067 --> 18:45.933
I get it.

18:45.933 --> 18:49.067
[David] I'm glad we met.

18:49.067 --> 18:51.700
'Cause I can show you
you don't have to play
that loud anymore

18:51.700 --> 18:54.467
if you don't want to.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.400
You know
what Scripture is, right?

18:58.067 --> 19:00.500
Uh... like the Bible?

19:00.500 --> 19:05.100
No. It's not just the Bible.

19:05.100 --> 19:08.700
It's everything.
All human knowledge.

19:08.700 --> 19:11.067
Everything that can be known
by the human mind.

19:11.067 --> 19:14.667
All wisdom. In one book.

19:14.667 --> 19:18.600
Sorry, man.
I'm not really into that.

19:18.600 --> 19:24.367
Believe me, I get it.
But we all have
something broken in us.

19:25.900 --> 19:28.100
And whether you believe it
or not, I'm telling you,

19:28.100 --> 19:31.233
Scripture's the only way
to fix it.

19:36.067 --> 19:40.533
Anyways, I don't wanna sell you
a bill of goods you don't want.

19:40.533 --> 19:45.133
I best be going.
Where you off to?

19:45.133 --> 19:47.767
-Back to L.A.
-At this hour?

19:47.767 --> 19:50.600
Don't drive through the night.
I got a place not far from here

19:50.600 --> 19:54.433
where a bunch of us stay
with an extra room
if you want it.

19:54.433 --> 19:57.967
But I'm warning you,
it is a hellhole.

19:57.967 --> 20:00.000
Nothing fancy,
no running water.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.700
We built it ourselves.

20:04.000 --> 20:10.500
But we play music. And we study.
And we live as a family.

20:11.733 --> 20:13.700
And it's kinda fun.

20:24.533 --> 20:27.900
-What's going on, Steve?
-You know what's going on.

20:27.900 --> 20:30.767
You don't know how hard
this has been for me.

20:30.767 --> 20:32.600
Trying to have a baby
for 10 years,

20:32.600 --> 20:34.600
and now you're having
David's child.

20:36.633 --> 20:37.867
It's too much.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.033
[sighs]

20:41.033 --> 20:43.900
Maybe I didn't think
this through.

20:43.900 --> 20:46.933
Maybe it was a mistake
to go along with David's
"New Light Revelation."

20:46.933 --> 20:51.500
Maybe we should have left
like Mark and Elizabeth.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.933
[sighs]

20:52.933 --> 20:55.867
If you didn't like it,
why did you accept it?

20:58.900 --> 21:00.067
I just thought--

21:01.933 --> 21:05.200
well, if your wife has a chance
to marry the "Lamb of God,"

21:05.200 --> 21:07.767
who am I to hold her back?
Right?

21:07.767 --> 21:10.300
-Steve--
-No. I don't wanna talk to you.

21:10.300 --> 21:11.933
I need some time to think.

21:18.167 --> 21:20.333
-Hey. Hey.
-[suitcase clatters]

21:20.333 --> 21:23.767
Steve, you men,
with all your talk
of suffering and sacrifice.

21:23.767 --> 21:26.700
You go ahead and feel sorry
for yourself for everything
you sacrifice for your faith.

21:26.700 --> 21:28.867
But you know what?
I'm that sacrifice.

21:28.867 --> 21:33.067
-You sacrificed me. No!
-No, no, no, no.

21:33.067 --> 21:36.900
I begged you to leave
when David had his revelation.

21:36.900 --> 21:39.633
I didn't want
to be one of his wives.

21:39.633 --> 21:43.133
I wanted to be  your wife.

21:43.133 --> 21:45.067
But you wouldn't go.

21:45.067 --> 21:47.367
And now, I  am his wife...

21:49.067 --> 21:51.433
and I'm having his child.

21:54.767 --> 21:58.167
[sighs] We wanted a baby.
We couldn't have one,

21:58.167 --> 22:01.467
and now, one's on the way.

22:01.467 --> 22:06.500
I know you feel like
this baby is a curse.
But I gotta tell ya...

22:07.900 --> 22:09.067
it's a miracle.

22:11.900 --> 22:13.800
[faint music playing]

22:22.367 --> 22:25.767
[engine stops,
car door opens, closes]

22:28.133 --> 22:31.733
Guys, this here
is Thibodeau.

22:31.733 --> 22:34.067
-[David] Steve, Judy.
-Nice to meet you.

22:34.067 --> 22:35.700
How are you?

22:35.700 --> 22:38.967
This guy right here,
best friend in the whole world.

22:38.967 --> 22:44.400
My rock. I wouldn't even know
what to do without you.

22:44.400 --> 22:49.433
And you...
congratulations, Mama.

22:49.433 --> 22:52.400
I can't even begin to tell you
how happy I am.

22:54.633 --> 22:58.133
-Yeah, me, too.
-[David] Good.

22:58.133 --> 23:00.767
All right,
let me give you a tour.

23:12.733 --> 23:14.767
[Thibodeau] All these people
come here to study?

23:14.767 --> 23:17.467
They come
from all over the world.
All walks of life--

23:17.467 --> 23:21.067
from scholars
to millionaire businessmen
to cops and nurses.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.800
I mean, we live in peace here
as a family. Hey, Sonobe.

23:23.800 --> 23:28.067
[sighs] You're welcome
to stay a night, a week,
as long as you like.

23:28.067 --> 23:31.233
Just no smoking,
drinking or drugs.
Anything like that, okay?

23:31.233 --> 23:33.433
All right. Welcome.

23:35.733 --> 23:37.500
Folks?

23:37.500 --> 23:41.067
This here's Thibodeau.
He's gonna stay with us a night.

23:41.067 --> 23:42.700
Hopefully longer.

23:50.433 --> 23:52.100
Hey, there.

23:52.100 --> 23:53.467
What's your name?

23:53.467 --> 23:55.633
-Serenity.
-That's a cool name.

23:55.633 --> 23:57.833
You seem like the boss
around here.

23:57.833 --> 24:01.300
If I have any questions,
I'll make sure
to bring 'em to you.

24:01.300 --> 24:03.067
Serenity,
what are you doing back up?

24:03.067 --> 24:07.067
-I put you in bed hours ago.
-I was bored sleeping.

24:07.067 --> 24:10.067
Hey, Michelle, will you make up
a bed here for Thibodeau?

24:11.467 --> 24:16.200
Of course. Good night.

24:16.200 --> 24:18.867
[news anchor]  ...walked out
of a mountaintop cabin
late this afternoon...

24:18.867 --> 24:20.967
David? You should see this.

24:20.967 --> 24:23.533
[reporter]  ...appearance
of military hardware like this.

24:23.533 --> 24:27.567
His one-man stand
against the law is suddenly
taking on the appearance

24:27.567 --> 24:29.800
of a full-blown war.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.333
They've got tanks,
helicopters and troops.

24:32.333 --> 24:35.233
For what? For a family
that lives by themselves
in the woods?

24:35.233 --> 24:38.433
They're just normal people.
So what if they might believe
a little different?

24:38.433 --> 24:42.167
Isn't that
what America's for?
Freedom of speech and religion?

25:02.667 --> 25:07.500
Hello, Mr. Weaver.
My name's Gary Noesner.

25:07.500 --> 25:10.267
I'm head of negotiations
for the FBI.

25:16.967 --> 25:21.867
Now, I know you've been shot.
And I know your son is dead,

25:21.867 --> 25:26.200
and there is nothing
I could ever say
to make that right.

25:28.533 --> 25:32.067
But the question is,
where do we go from here?

25:33.267 --> 25:36.067
I guess if I were you...

25:36.067 --> 25:40.100
I'd be thinking,
"How do I make these people pay
for what they've done?"

25:42.467 --> 25:46.733
[Gary] If you want
to strike back in the place
that'll hurt them the most,

25:46.733 --> 25:50.167
you come out peacefully.

25:50.167 --> 25:52.467
Take your day in court,

25:52.467 --> 25:57.700
you tell the world
what really happened up here
at Ruby Ridge.

25:57.700 --> 26:01.533
You see,
dead men don't get a trial.

26:01.533 --> 26:05.133
You die, you give everyone
a free pass.

26:08.700 --> 26:11.800
And Vicky, I'm sure you're angry
about losing Sammy, too.

26:11.800 --> 26:14.867
But you have a husband
and three daughters

26:14.867 --> 26:17.300
-who still need--
-[Randy] You killed Vicky!

26:19.367 --> 26:20.833
What'd you say, Randy?

26:20.833 --> 26:23.700
You shot her!
You killed my wife!

26:36.900 --> 26:40.667
-Couldn't get him to engage?
-Your guy killed his wife.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.900
-What?
-Your sniper--

26:44.900 --> 26:47.100
he missed Weaver
and shot his wife.

26:48.500 --> 26:50.400
[Gary]
Doesn't help our cause much.

26:57.567 --> 26:58.867
Ah...

27:00.433 --> 27:03.233
[strumming softly]

27:03.233 --> 27:07.067
Hey... you hear
Judy was pregnant?

27:07.067 --> 27:08.800
Mm-hmm.

27:08.800 --> 27:12.200
I had my suspicions.

27:12.200 --> 27:16.133
Well, you didn't say anything.
And I had to hear it from Wayne.

27:16.133 --> 27:17.733
[chuckles]

27:17.733 --> 27:19.700
I just didn't want you
to get your hopes up.

27:19.700 --> 27:21.767
My hopes up?

27:21.767 --> 27:24.100
At her age, there's a chance
it doesn't work out.

27:24.100 --> 27:27.933
[laughs]

27:27.933 --> 27:31.467
What?

27:31.467 --> 27:33.200
Don't look at me like that.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.133
You don't have to worry.

27:35.133 --> 27:37.500
Cyrus will always be
my little superstar.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.233
I'm not worried.

27:39.233 --> 27:41.667
Good.

27:41.667 --> 27:43.767
[Thibodeau]
So you're David's best friend?

27:43.767 --> 27:46.567
On some days.

27:46.567 --> 27:48.233
So how did you meet him?

27:48.233 --> 27:49.833
That is a long story.

27:52.500 --> 27:55.333
[Thibodeau]
If you don't wanna talk,
that's cool.

28:02.667 --> 28:04.067
[sighs]

28:07.733 --> 28:09.267
About seven years ago,

28:09.267 --> 28:12.667
my wife Judy and I
were living in Hawaii

28:12.667 --> 28:15.433
and I was working on my PhD
in theology.

28:15.433 --> 28:20.133
And this friend of mine,
he gave me an audiotape

28:20.133 --> 28:24.067
of David's interpretation
of the Seven Seals.

28:24.067 --> 28:27.967
-And it struck me.
-The "Seven Seals"?

28:29.267 --> 28:31.200
Yeah. The Seven Seals.

28:31.200 --> 28:34.200
It's in the Book of Revelation.

28:34.200 --> 28:38.100
It's considered to be
the most mysterious

28:38.100 --> 28:41.333
and unknowable passages
in the whole Bible.

28:41.333 --> 28:44.067
You know,
I didn't believe him at first.

28:44.067 --> 28:46.133
And I was trying
to catch him out.

28:46.133 --> 28:49.633
I even had one of my professors
come down to argue with him.

28:49.633 --> 28:53.067
But David... [chuckles]

28:53.067 --> 28:55.267
I've been around
this stuff my whole life.

28:55.267 --> 28:59.500
I'm raised
Seventh-Day Adventist.
I'm going to college for it.

28:59.500 --> 29:03.967
His ability
to understand Scripture was
like nothing I'd ever seen.

29:03.967 --> 29:07.067
He's memorized
the entire Bible.

29:07.067 --> 29:10.167
[laughs] Who does that?

29:10.167 --> 29:13.800
[Steve laughs] So, it didn't
take me long to realize

29:13.800 --> 29:17.733
something... miraculous,

29:17.733 --> 29:20.067
going on here with this guy.

29:20.067 --> 29:23.700
-Miraculous?
-Okay, let me explain it
another way.

29:23.700 --> 29:27.900
Do you believe
that things can happen

29:27.900 --> 29:32.600
that are beyond our capacity
to rationalize

29:32.600 --> 29:36.700
because we have
this very limited

29:36.700 --> 29:39.900
temporal view of reality?

29:41.300 --> 29:43.600
-I guess, yeah.
-Well, stay here.

29:43.600 --> 29:45.867
Spend some time with David.

29:45.867 --> 29:49.767
And you're gonna see
things like that.

29:49.767 --> 29:51.100
Miracles.

30:01.867 --> 30:04.167
We can't afford to drag this out
much longer, Gary.

30:04.167 --> 30:05.933
We're in
a compromised position here.

30:05.933 --> 30:08.933
Yeah, I'm aware
of the position we're in.

30:08.933 --> 30:11.733
But sometimes
the best strategy is just wait

30:11.733 --> 30:16.033
-regardless of the circumstance.
-That's your plan? Just wait?

30:17.767 --> 30:19.867
[man]
Get your hands off me, boy.

30:21.167 --> 30:23.567
-Nope.
-Where the hell's Noesner?

30:23.567 --> 30:25.300
That's my plan.

30:28.833 --> 30:31.200
[Gary] I really appreciate
you coming out, Bo.

30:31.200 --> 30:35.300
Why'd you bring me up here?
I don't even know Randy Weaver.

30:35.300 --> 30:38.133
Well, when I can't get a man
to trust me,

30:38.133 --> 30:41.600
I try to find someone
he  will trust.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.633
I was thinking
that might be you.

30:43.633 --> 30:47.000
You're a fellow Green Beret,
similar opinions
about the government--

30:47.000 --> 30:50.100
I mean, you're a hero
to the radical right.

30:50.100 --> 30:53.867
You may not know him,
but he sure as hell knows you.

30:53.867 --> 30:55.733
Uh-uh. Nope.

30:55.733 --> 31:01.767
I ain't helping the goddamn FBI
with none of this nonsense.

31:01.767 --> 31:04.700
Now, you know
how you move a man?

31:04.700 --> 31:07.433
Fear.

31:07.433 --> 31:09.867
Figure out
what someone's scared of,

31:09.867 --> 31:14.533
you can get him to do
pretty much anything.

31:14.533 --> 31:18.167
Now these hotheads down here,
you know what they're scared of?

31:18.167 --> 31:21.267
They're scared that Vicky
and Sammy Weaver are dead

31:21.267 --> 31:25.400
and if that ever goes to court,
it's gonna be a problem for 'em.

31:25.400 --> 31:28.167
And poor Randy Weaver's scared
if he comes out of his cabin

31:28.167 --> 31:30.667
someone's gonna shoot him.

31:30.667 --> 31:34.433
Now, I'm scared
that if I can't get you
to talk them out,

31:34.433 --> 31:38.633
these boys are gonna go
in there anyway
and more people will get hurt.

31:40.233 --> 31:42.333
And I don't know,
but I imagine you're scared

31:42.333 --> 31:46.867
that your friends will see you
help the Feds and turn on you.

31:46.867 --> 31:52.133
But what you should really
be scared of...

31:52.133 --> 31:58.467
is if those kids die,
and you know you could've done
something to stop it.

31:58.467 --> 32:03.433
Mm. How's that gonna feel?

32:13.433 --> 32:15.100
[yells] Randy?

32:15.100 --> 32:18.767
It's me, Bo Gritz.

32:18.767 --> 32:23.700
I need you to open
that door, unarmed,
and come on out.

32:23.700 --> 32:26.267
I give you my word, we'll hand
these boys their asses

32:26.267 --> 32:28.133
for what they done up here.

32:39.067 --> 32:41.433
Bo, is that really you?

32:46.867 --> 32:49.067
Yeah, it sure is, Randy.

32:56.067 --> 32:58.433
Bo, you wouldn't believe
how pretty my wife was.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.233
This thing's over, Randy.

33:09.567 --> 33:14.067
It's time to start thinking
about your other children.

33:14.067 --> 33:17.200
Come on out, and let's get you
some justice, huh?
It's the only way.

33:33.167 --> 33:34.467
[door rattles]

33:40.700 --> 33:42.167
I'm coming out.

33:44.567 --> 33:46.433
Everybody move in.

33:48.133 --> 33:49.400
[agent] On your knees!

34:03.367 --> 34:06.400
[radio chatter transmitting]

34:49.067 --> 34:51.067
[voices yelling]

34:54.833 --> 34:56.700
[yelling]

35:06.067 --> 35:09.100
[knocking on door]
You wanted to see me, sir?

35:11.833 --> 35:14.367
DOJ report came out.

35:14.367 --> 35:16.467
They're pinning
Ruby Ridge on us.

35:16.467 --> 35:20.300
-Aw, that's bullshit.
-Politicians are
so short-sighted.

35:20.300 --> 35:22.200
Congress are talking
about shutting us down,

35:22.200 --> 35:23.833
and Clinton's saying
he'll support it.

35:23.833 --> 35:26.333
FBI shot Vicky Weaver.
How is that our fault?

35:26.333 --> 35:29.067
It was our crappy case
to begin with.

35:29.067 --> 35:31.567
March 10th, they're talking
about defunding the ATF.

35:31.567 --> 35:34.067
Come March 11th,
we might all be out of a job.

35:36.267 --> 35:38.500
-[distant voices yelling]
-[sighs]

35:40.167 --> 35:41.367
What can we do to stop it?

35:41.367 --> 35:42.967
[yelling continues]

35:49.100 --> 35:50.867
[clattering]

35:58.067 --> 36:00.067
[Steve] Thanks, Thibs.

36:00.067 --> 36:01.400
Can you help me?

36:03.233 --> 36:05.400
Oh, jeez.

36:05.400 --> 36:07.867
Oh, I feel like a whale.

36:07.867 --> 36:11.300
-Well, you kinda look like one.
-Well, Steve--!

36:11.300 --> 36:14.700
-Oh, that's real nice.
That's real nice.
-Come on, big girl.

36:14.700 --> 36:16.633
[laughing]

36:18.333 --> 36:21.333
Hey, let me get that.

36:21.333 --> 36:25.500
-Oh, thanks. Thanks, Thibs.
-Yeah.

36:25.500 --> 36:27.200
You're always so nice.

36:27.200 --> 36:32.067
Yeah, well, you're my homie.
That's what homies do.

36:32.067 --> 36:33.467
What's a "homie"?

36:35.933 --> 36:39.700
Sometimes I feel like I traveled
back in time to be here...

36:39.700 --> 36:43.267
like I'm an alien
from the future.
Sent back to the 1800s

36:43.267 --> 36:47.167
to teach people
the important things--
like the word, "homie."

36:47.167 --> 36:50.067
-[splashes]
-Oof.

36:50.067 --> 36:55.100
Well, we loved
having you around here
for the last six months.

36:59.500 --> 37:02.100
-[splashes]
-You think you'll stay?

37:02.100 --> 37:06.500
Yeah. Yeah, for a while.
Hard to say how long, though.

37:12.067 --> 37:14.867
-[knocking on door]
-[Hardwick] Come in.

37:14.867 --> 37:17.167
You got a minute?

37:17.167 --> 37:19.533
[Hardwick] Sure.

37:19.533 --> 37:22.167
-What's on your mind?
-[sniffles]

37:25.900 --> 37:30.267
The Ruby Ridge report?
I have some concerns.

37:30.267 --> 37:32.933
Mm-hmm.

37:32.933 --> 37:37.733
It says that Mitch
"acted appropriately."

37:37.733 --> 37:41.733
Well, in all fairness,
he wasn't trying
to kill Vicky Weaver.

37:41.733 --> 37:45.400
No, but he did break
the rules of engagement
in the field.

37:45.400 --> 37:48.633
He should be facing
an investigation, not getting
a pat on the back.

37:48.633 --> 37:51.933
This mess belongs to the ATF.

37:51.933 --> 37:54.867
Look. The boys upstairs
are worried
that if we reprimand Mitch

37:54.867 --> 37:57.100
-then we're admitting fault;
-But we  are at fault.

37:57.100 --> 38:00.867
He issued
a "kill on sight" command
and a woman was killed.

38:00.867 --> 38:05.100
Look. My dad used to say,
"You don't earn trust

38:05.100 --> 38:09.933
by telling people
how good you did. You earn it
by saying the hard stuff."

38:09.933 --> 38:13.867
Now, our greatest asset
as an agency
is that people believe in us.

38:13.867 --> 38:17.400
But if we lose that trust,
we might not ever get it back.

38:17.400 --> 38:21.467
Now, look, Gary,
it's a little tricky...
politically.

38:21.467 --> 38:23.433
But...

38:23.433 --> 38:26.067
thanks for coming in.

38:26.067 --> 38:27.733
[motors roaring]

38:30.967 --> 38:34.300
Getting those go-karts
may be the worst idea
I ever had.

38:34.300 --> 38:36.500
Brad's a beast on that thing.

38:36.500 --> 38:38.600
I was right behind him
the day he flipped it.

38:41.333 --> 38:43.700
You happy here, Thibs?

38:43.700 --> 38:46.567
Yeah. Yeah.
It's been real nice.

38:46.567 --> 38:51.600
I'm afraid my mom thinks
I've lost my mind-- moving in
with a Bible study group.

38:51.600 --> 38:54.100
Have her come visit,
see for herself.

38:54.100 --> 38:56.700
Trust me,
you want no piece of my mom.

38:56.700 --> 38:58.467
Yeah. You want
no piece of mine, either.

38:58.467 --> 39:00.333
-Mm-hmm.
-[chuckling]

39:03.300 --> 39:05.433
Thing is...

39:05.433 --> 39:07.900
we don't allow tourists
to stay here..

39:09.700 --> 39:12.800
-You think I'm a tourist?
-Doesn't matter what I think.

39:14.067 --> 39:15.200
Are you a tourist?

39:17.133 --> 39:20.067
Are you really willing
to do this?

39:22.133 --> 39:24.533
I'm for real.

39:24.533 --> 39:25.933
Good.

39:28.900 --> 39:32.467
You think you could
remain celibate if you stay?

39:32.467 --> 39:34.633
[faint chuckle] Seriously?

39:40.833 --> 39:42.733
No.

39:45.700 --> 39:49.933
Yeah. Well, four years ago,

39:49.933 --> 39:53.833
I had this revelation
that really shook things up.

39:53.833 --> 39:57.533
Lost some dear friends.

39:57.533 --> 40:02.400
I had this vision
that we're all slaves
to our own sexual desires--

40:02.400 --> 40:06.900
that our sexuality keeps us
bound to the lower parts
of our beings.

40:09.433 --> 40:10.700
And believe me...

40:10.700 --> 40:14.167
it's not easy for anyone.

40:14.167 --> 40:18.233
But without sex, it opens up.
It becomes clear.

40:22.333 --> 40:24.267
And what about
the married guys?

40:25.700 --> 40:27.300
They're celibate, too.

40:28.800 --> 40:31.167
I've assumed
the burden of sex for us all.

40:31.167 --> 40:32.867
But not for my own kicks.

40:38.100 --> 40:42.367
Book of Revelation
tells of 24 elders
that will sit in judgment

40:42.367 --> 40:43.967
over the End Times.

40:45.900 --> 40:48.167
The kids we're generating,
right here...

40:50.233 --> 40:52.667
they'll be those elders.

40:55.233 --> 40:56.633
[sighs]

40:58.633 --> 41:02.867
I don't know, man.
I'd have to think about it.

41:02.867 --> 41:05.833
If I could just understand
its purpose.

41:07.767 --> 41:09.833
I'd like to learn more.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.900
It's a toughie.

41:14.900 --> 41:18.600
Some people only focus
on what they give up.

41:18.600 --> 41:20.200
But I'm telling you...

41:23.467 --> 41:25.967
those that stay...

41:25.967 --> 41:28.267
they gain so much more.

41:34.067 --> 41:35.800
[sighs]

41:37.933 --> 41:40.267
[knocking on door]
I need you to look at this.

41:40.267 --> 41:42.967
-What is it?
-A UPS driver found a box
of grenade casings

41:42.967 --> 41:46.067
headed for a religious group
in Waco, Texas.

41:46.067 --> 41:47.667
What do we know
about the group?

41:47.667 --> 41:49.267
They're called
the Branch Davidians.

41:49.267 --> 41:51.367
Their leader is a guy
named David Koresh.

41:51.367 --> 41:54.267
Born Vernon Howell.
One prior for armed assault.

41:54.267 --> 41:57.700
A former member of their group
estimates they spent close
to 200 grand

41:57.700 --> 41:59.533
on guns and parts
in the last couple of years.

41:59.533 --> 42:02.800
Whoa! What are they planning
on doing with all those guns?

42:02.800 --> 42:05.133
I don't know, but get this.
That guy's a polygamist.

42:05.133 --> 42:06.767
He's got a bunch of wives
and children

42:06.767 --> 42:08.433
and our informant--

42:08.433 --> 42:11.100
he believes some of those kids
are being abused.

42:11.100 --> 42:15.067
Now Child Services
has investigated twice,
but can't make a case.

42:15.067 --> 42:17.300
And we could stop it.

42:18.967 --> 42:20.767
If we come out
of that compound

42:20.767 --> 42:23.067
with a bunch of innocent kids
and loaded guns,

42:24.867 --> 42:26.800
it might remind Congress
why they need us.

42:26.800 --> 42:29.733
I'll get a surveillance team
set up top of next week.

42:30.900 --> 42:34.400
No. Start one tonight.

42:45.667 --> 42:49.667
-[cooing]
-[Judy] I just love her
so much, Steve.

42:49.667 --> 42:53.367
More than anything
I've ever loved.

42:53.367 --> 42:57.600
Look at her.
She has your eyes.

42:57.600 --> 43:01.067
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

43:01.067 --> 43:03.667
-[softly] Hi.
-[baby coughs]

43:03.667 --> 43:07.067
[laughs]
Do you wanna hold her?

43:08.100 --> 43:09.567
Go on, you hold her.

43:11.600 --> 43:13.400
Okay.

43:13.400 --> 43:15.600
-[chuckles softly]
-Can I hold you?

43:15.600 --> 43:18.567
[knocking on door]
Let's get a good look at her,
shall we?

43:18.567 --> 43:23.067
-[baby cries briefly]
-[David] All right.

43:23.067 --> 43:26.667
[David] Oh, look at her.

43:26.667 --> 43:31.567
-Oh, hello.
-[coughs]

43:31.567 --> 43:33.433
She has my eyes.

43:33.433 --> 43:35.600
[baby whines]

43:38.800 --> 43:41.067
Her name will be "Mayanah,"

43:41.067 --> 43:44.167
like the myna bird
that talks and talks.

43:44.167 --> 43:47.600
-[baby coughs]
-She's so beautiful.

43:47.600 --> 43:50.433
You done good. Real good.

43:52.333 --> 43:55.333
-[baby whimpers]
-Oh, Steve.

43:55.333 --> 44:00.300
We're watching
"Lawnmower Man" downstairs in
five minutes if you wanna join.

44:00.300 --> 44:03.167
-[baby crying]
-All right.

44:05.967 --> 44:07.300
[signal beeps]

44:14.333 --> 44:16.500
Birthday?

44:16.500 --> 44:22.667
No. Justice Department
just upped my budget
another 10 million bucks.

44:25.867 --> 44:28.600
Congratulations.

44:28.600 --> 44:29.667
Thanks.

44:31.867 --> 44:33.800
[music playing]

44:42.100 --> 44:44.467
[sighs]
You coming to bed soon?

44:44.467 --> 44:46.433
In a bit.

44:46.433 --> 44:47.667
What's wrong?

44:49.833 --> 44:51.400
Nothing.

44:54.167 --> 44:57.467
What's going on? Talk to me.

45:02.067 --> 45:07.133
I've wanted to be an FBI agent
since I was 12 years old,
you know?

45:07.133 --> 45:12.133
I saw J. Edgar Hoover
on  The Mickey Mouse Club
and I was hooked.

45:12.133 --> 45:16.400
I couldn't imagine
a better thing to be.

45:16.400 --> 45:18.900
But what if,
after all these years,
I've been believing

45:18.900 --> 45:22.433
we're better
than we actually are?

45:24.367 --> 45:28.167
Where's this coming from?
What happened?

45:28.167 --> 45:31.700
They gave
10 million dollars to HRT.

45:31.700 --> 45:34.067
You want them to give more money
to your department?

45:34.067 --> 45:36.500
No.

45:36.500 --> 45:40.067
The balance of power
is shifting.

45:40.067 --> 45:45.900
We're militarizing.
We're changing... into something
I didn't sign up for.

45:45.900 --> 45:48.867
Well, then, if you're
that concerned, you just need
to talk to Hardwick.

45:48.867 --> 45:53.500
-You two are friendly.
-I did. It fell on deaf ears.

45:54.600 --> 45:56.633
Well, then, talk louder.

46:00.633 --> 46:03.867
[birds chirping]

46:08.233 --> 46:10.633
[David sighs]

46:10.633 --> 46:11.700
All right.

46:14.700 --> 46:16.500
[panting]

46:16.500 --> 46:18.533
[rattling]

46:18.533 --> 46:19.600
Come on.

46:32.333 --> 46:34.967
Can't help yourself, can you?

46:34.967 --> 46:37.333
No. Uh-oh, who's passing who?

46:38.967 --> 46:40.833
Yeah!
