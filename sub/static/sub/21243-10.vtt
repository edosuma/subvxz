00:23.065 --> 00:25.192
[students continue cheering]

00:25.317 --> 00:27.110
I hope everyone's enjoyed their dinners.

00:27.194 --> 00:29.404
Now, the moment
everyone's been waiting for...

00:29.487 --> 00:30.488
prom king and queen.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.157
-Ooh!
-[chuckles]

00:34.742 --> 00:36.828
Zoë Rivas and Rasha Zuabi!

[cheering loudly]

00:54.971 --> 00:56.139
Should I be worried?

00:56.223 --> 00:59.142
'Cause Zig's been talking to Esme
for, like, an hour.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.269
What, do you think he's, like, in danger
or something? Or...

01:01.353 --> 01:03.146
Yeah, of hooking up with Cruella De Vil.

01:03.230 --> 01:04.272
Zig would never ditch Maya.

01:04.356 --> 01:05.565
[students cheer]

01:06.566 --> 01:10.237
We would like to invite all the couples
to join our queens on the dance floor.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.577
-Go. It's okay. Go.
-What will you do?

01:18.995 --> 01:23.541
I don't know. I'll take a walk.
Maybe I'll meet a new Prince Charming. Go.

01:23.625 --> 01:24.876
Come on.

[Esme crying]

01:52.529 --> 01:54.864
What am I going to do? [sobbing]

01:54.947 --> 01:56.283
[Maya] Esme?

01:56.366 --> 01:57.284
[Esme gasps and sniffles]

01:57.367 --> 01:59.661
Hey. Are you okay?

02:00.245 --> 02:03.080
If you had just left us alone,
this never would have happened!

02:06.376 --> 02:08.170
-Where's Zig?
-[breathing heavily]

02:10.130 --> 02:11.047
Zig?

02:13.675 --> 02:14.759
[gasps]

02:18.930 --> 02:20.056
Zig?

02:21.433 --> 02:22.434
[breath trembling] Zig?

02:25.520 --> 02:27.522
Maya? [groans]

03:12.859 --> 03:14.402
Those crowns look so good on you guys.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.696
Yeah, they'd probably look better
on us, though.

03:16.779 --> 03:18.615
-Just saying.
-[both chuckle]

03:18.698 --> 03:22.702
I can't believe we're prom queens.
I think Jonah is actually jealous.

03:25.413 --> 03:27.081
That's no reason to be upset.

03:27.164 --> 03:28.875
[chuckles]

03:28.958 --> 03:32.003
Sorry. My mom was prom queen and...

03:32.086 --> 03:33.880
she always hoped
that I'd be prom queen, too.

03:33.963 --> 03:37.049
-And you did it!
-Except I can't share it with her.

03:37.133 --> 03:40.470
And with prom tonight
and graduation tomorrow,

03:40.553 --> 03:43.390
-I've really been missing her.
-I get it.

03:43.473 --> 03:46.142
Of course you do.
You have no idea where your family is.

03:47.602 --> 03:48.686
In Lebanon. [chuckles]

03:49.271 --> 03:50.897
-With a cousin.
-[chuckles]

03:50.980 --> 03:53.816
I've been texting my mom.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.110
I thought she couldn't handle the fact
that you were gay.

03:56.193 --> 03:58.571
Now she's just glad I'm safe.

03:58.655 --> 03:59.947
I... I should've told you.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.825
You didn't wanna make me feel bad
about my own crappy family.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.201
Call your mom.

04:04.286 --> 04:07.955
[scoffs] It's been seven months.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.791
What if nothing's changed?

04:09.874 --> 04:12.585
Then off with her head!

04:12.669 --> 04:14.045
[both chuckle]

04:22.762 --> 04:24.597
The leg's not broken.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.098
Just a bad sprain.

04:26.974 --> 04:28.851
-What happened?
-[sighs]

04:28.935 --> 04:30.937
I... I told you. I slipped.

04:31.020 --> 04:33.022
[paramedic] You should get home.
Get some rest.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.276
[Maya sighs]

04:37.819 --> 04:40.572
Okay, you can't let
Esme get away with this.

04:40.655 --> 04:43.408
-What if she hurts somebody else?
-Maya, I told you it was an accident.

04:43.491 --> 04:46.661
-That doesn't make it okay.
-Yeah. Because she's not okay.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.122
She hasn't been ever since we found...

04:53.876 --> 04:56.879
[stutters] Ever since she found out
that we were going to prom together.

04:58.214 --> 05:01.258
-This wasn't her fault.
-I should've never asked you to prom.

05:02.885 --> 05:05.722
I'm sorry I got you involved
in my relationship drama.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.351
I'm Maya Matlin.

05:10.267 --> 05:11.811
Drama follows me.

05:21.529 --> 05:23.948
-Ew.
-Don't be jealous.

05:24.031 --> 05:25.533
Her dress was a disaster.

05:25.617 --> 05:28.870
-What are you doing here?
-I messed up and I need your help.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.414
Do you have a pen and paper?
We need to make a plan.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.666
-Are you okay?
-[Esme breathing heavily]

05:33.750 --> 05:35.001
You seem a little on edge.

05:35.084 --> 05:37.920
Zig's about to get back together
with Maya. Of course I'm on edge!

05:38.004 --> 05:39.589
I saw pics.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.716
-They went to prom together.
-I tried to stop it,

05:41.799 --> 05:44.093
but I just made everything worse.
He's not gonna forgive me, Frankie!

05:44.176 --> 05:46.471
Where do you keep your freaking pens?

05:56.147 --> 05:57.231
Okay.

06:00.818 --> 06:01.861
What do we do now?

06:03.696 --> 06:06.741
-You could try apologizing.
-That won't be enough.

06:07.659 --> 06:10.495
Okay. Then... a gift is always nice.

06:11.078 --> 06:14.416
Zig's always wanted a motorcycle.
My cousin owns a high-end bike shop.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.250
We'll call that a first idea.

06:16.333 --> 06:20.129
My mom always says her best thinking
comes after a good night's sleep.

06:20.212 --> 06:23.174
-You're right.
-Great. I will call you...

06:26.469 --> 06:27.720
a cab. [sighs]

06:39.899 --> 06:42.819
Anyone starving?
I could literally eat this menu.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.154
That's it. I'm calling my mom.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.537
She's not answering.

06:53.955 --> 06:55.372
Wait, should I leave a message?

06:56.290 --> 06:59.961
Hi, Mom. I won prom queen tonight.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.881
I'm also valedictorian tomorrow.

07:07.051 --> 07:10.638
I love you, and...
and I want you in my life.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.600
Please come to graduation tomorrow.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.439
Now what?

07:20.022 --> 07:23.109
-Burritos or enchiladas? I can't decide.
-[all chuckle]

07:24.151 --> 07:25.778
[cell phone vibrating]

07:27.279 --> 07:28.448
I can't look.

07:30.617 --> 07:31.784
I'll do it.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.120
It's your mom.

07:34.203 --> 07:36.706
She wants to know what time
the ceremony's at.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.709
-She's coming?
-[chuckles]

07:39.792 --> 07:41.961
-She's coming!
-[both chuckle]

07:54.223 --> 07:56.142
Rise and shine, Maya Matlin.
Graduation day.

07:56.225 --> 07:57.602
-[chuckles]
-[Maya] I can't go.

07:58.978 --> 08:01.981
-You're singing!
-I can't do that, either.

08:02.064 --> 08:06.569
-If I stay in bed, nothing bad can happen.
-Uh, except you'll miss graduation.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.362
Caps and gowns, final farewells...

08:08.445 --> 08:10.782
Don't you wanna see
your mom bursting with pride?

08:10.865 --> 08:12.366
Of course, but...

08:13.367 --> 08:15.828
[sighs] I just have a really bad feeling
about today.

08:15.912 --> 08:19.541
That's allowed, but I won't let you
miss graduation because of it.

08:19.624 --> 08:20.833
[Grace grunts]

08:21.709 --> 08:23.670
-[grunts]
-Is this about Zig and Esme hooking up?

08:23.753 --> 08:26.255
No, they... they didn't hook up.
But things...

08:27.549 --> 08:29.967
They got messy. I just feel like...

08:30.927 --> 08:33.638
every time I do something to be happy,
somebody gets hurt.

08:33.721 --> 08:36.516
-That's your depression brain talking.
-Yeah, well, it feels real.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.143
[sighs]

08:39.226 --> 08:41.938
Listen, I don't know if I should go
to California next year.

08:42.021 --> 08:44.732
SoCalArt is your dream.
What would your doctor tell you to do?

08:45.817 --> 08:48.402
Deep breaths,
and take it one step at a time.

08:48.485 --> 08:49.987
Okay. So, you start breathing,

08:50.071 --> 08:52.073
I'll go start you a shower
and we'll go from there.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.456
What happened after prom?

09:00.540 --> 09:02.875
How can you talk about prom
when a great injustice has been done?

09:02.959 --> 09:04.961
[scoffs] She's talking about
the bomb threat.

09:05.044 --> 09:07.547
All I did was give the school info
that I snapped off Saad's computer.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.049
Why would Saad wanna blow up prom?
He's just a regular guy.

09:10.132 --> 09:12.051
Yeah, who was talking to
some pretty scary people online.

09:12.134 --> 09:13.344
He was lonely.

09:13.427 --> 09:15.221
Yeah, well, lonely people do
desperate things.

09:15.304 --> 09:16.305
Oh, God.

09:16.889 --> 09:17.890
What?

09:19.391 --> 09:21.227
Okay, it's probably nothing...

09:22.186 --> 09:24.063
but Esme said she tried to stop prom.

09:24.146 --> 09:26.315
-So she's responsible?
-I never said that.

09:26.398 --> 09:29.110
Esme's crazy, but not that crazy.

09:29.193 --> 09:31.403
-Where's Esme now?
-She's in my room.

09:31.487 --> 09:34.156
Be careful! She seems really fragile.

09:41.914 --> 09:44.667
-She's not here.
-Then... then where is she?

09:46.335 --> 09:48.129
-[Jonah and Grace chuckle]
-[camera shutter clicks]

09:48.212 --> 09:50.715
Okay. Now take a picture
of Maya and I over here.

09:50.798 --> 09:52.549
Oh, okay.

09:52.634 --> 09:54.761
Because we must remember
this bench forever.

09:54.844 --> 09:58.222
-[chuckling] This is where we first met.
-Oh, yeah, right.

09:58.305 --> 10:01.350
When Miles thought you could
track down my cyberbully.

10:01.433 --> 10:03.603
Uh. When were you ever friends with Miles?

10:03.686 --> 10:06.606
-Oh, they dated.
-Until she broke my heart.

10:06.689 --> 10:10.442
Yeah, well, maybe you shouldn't have
accepted a striptease from Zoë Rivas.

10:10.526 --> 10:12.569
Who turned out to be
your cyberbully. [laughs]

10:12.654 --> 10:13.863
Ah, the good old days.

10:15.322 --> 10:18.117
What? I don't look that silly
in this cap, do I?

10:18.200 --> 10:20.745
-You passed history!
-By 5%.

10:21.537 --> 10:22.872
Thanks to you.

10:22.955 --> 10:25.082
See? Good things do happen
when Maya Matlin's around.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.459
-[Grace and Jonah chuckle]
-Are you okay?

10:28.711 --> 10:30.922
A little tender. [sighs] You?

10:31.505 --> 10:32.674
Same. [sighs]

10:33.424 --> 10:36.468
Great. Everybody's okay.
Now it's time to graduate. [chuckles]

10:40.765 --> 10:43.768
Uh... here or there?

10:43.851 --> 10:45.645
-Definitely there.
-[sighs]

10:49.315 --> 10:51.400
[sighs] I can't believe
Mom's actually coming.

10:51.483 --> 10:53.235
[chuckles]

10:53.319 --> 10:54.987
[Rasha] Looks like she's here.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.323
-How do I look?
-Beautiful.

10:57.406 --> 10:58.700
[both chuckle]

11:01.410 --> 11:03.537
You didn't have to come so early.

11:03.620 --> 11:06.874
Best seats in the house.
Perks of being valedictorian. [chuckles]

11:08.375 --> 11:09.711
Is Mom parking the car?

11:10.627 --> 11:12.588
She's not coming, Zoë. I'm sorry.

11:14.631 --> 11:17.969
-Then why are you here?
-She wanted you to have this.

11:24.433 --> 11:28.187
So your mom wasn't ready to come,
but she got you a graduation gift.

11:37.613 --> 11:41.450
-What are those documents for?
-I need this stuff for university.

11:43.828 --> 11:46.580
-She doesn't want me anymore.
-Maybe the letter explains it.

11:46.663 --> 11:49.000
No, no. [chuckles] It's fine.

11:50.292 --> 11:51.293
I am.

11:52.211 --> 11:56.173
I just need to forget about her
and focus on the speech.

12:00.344 --> 12:01.971
-[Maya chuckles]
-Hey, have you seen Esme?

12:02.054 --> 12:03.305
No. Don't jinx it.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.974
Well, she came to my house
really upset last night

12:05.057 --> 12:06.183
and I thought she'd be here.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.936
-She's graduating, right?
-She's not on my list.

12:09.020 --> 12:11.981
She's a straight-A student.
She got into Harvard.

12:12.064 --> 12:14.984
Well, she hasn't been in class
for, like, a month.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.238
Well, at least we don't have to
worry about her today.

12:19.321 --> 12:22.241
Well, we should be worried.
There's obviously a problem.

12:22.324 --> 12:23.910
We should tell somebody
what happened at prom.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.787
Wait, do you mean the bomb threat?

12:26.662 --> 12:29.623
-That was Esme?
-I don't know. Maybe?

12:31.417 --> 12:33.836
-[graduation music playing]
-Okay, guys, it's go time.

12:34.879 --> 12:38.132
I'll figure this out after graduation.
Okay?

12:46.765 --> 12:48.017
Oh, no.

12:48.767 --> 12:50.186
[all cheering]

12:52.729 --> 12:55.107
Thank you for coming to celebrate
this year's class.

12:55.191 --> 12:58.861
And now, may I present our valedictorian,
Zoë Rivas.

13:07.786 --> 13:12.083
Seems like just yesterday we were all
tiny freshmen struggling with our lockers

13:12.166 --> 13:14.210
and now we're graduating! [chuckles]

13:15.669 --> 13:20.216
We wouldn't be here without the support
of our teachers,

13:20.299 --> 13:22.218
our friends and...

13:25.137 --> 13:26.472
our families.

When I arrived at Degrassi as a...

13:38.650 --> 13:40.111

an emotional day.

[crying] So... that's the last memory
everyone will have of me.

14:39.253 --> 14:43.632
-A blubbering idiot.
-Hey, at least it was... memorable.

14:43.715 --> 14:46.843
[inhales sharply]
Everyone else had their families there.

14:47.761 --> 14:52.766
I just... looked at those seats
and all I could think is, "I'm alone."

14:54.185 --> 14:56.353
So what am I? An acquaintance? [chuckles]

14:56.437 --> 14:58.564
-Yeah. What about me?
-[Winston] Me, too?

14:59.481 --> 15:02.318
[Zoë exhales]
I love you guys, but it's not the same.

15:02.401 --> 15:05.154
You're not my family.
Who am I going to spend holidays with?

15:05.237 --> 15:07.031
-I get Thanksgiving.
-Christmas.

15:07.114 --> 15:09.075
Easter. Of course, I don't celebrate it,

15:09.158 --> 15:11.911
but if you need someone for Eid,
I'm your girl.

15:21.503 --> 15:24.465
-You bought a motorcycle?
-It's a graduation gift! [chuckles]

15:24.548 --> 15:27.343
[sniffles] Look, I know things got
a little intense last night...

15:27.426 --> 15:30.137
Esme, there is something
seriously wrong with you.

15:30.221 --> 15:33.599
I know. Your friends
are trying to tear us apart.

15:34.641 --> 15:37.436
[chuckles] Which is why
I got this motorcycle.

15:37.519 --> 15:39.146
We have to get away.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.066
I'm graduating.

15:42.149 --> 15:46.362
-So? They'll mail you your diploma.
-[Zig] And I can't drive a motorcycle.

15:48.530 --> 15:53.410
Why do you keep poking holes in my plans?
I'm trying to fix us! [crying]

15:53.494 --> 15:56.663
-Why don't you see that?
-Calm down. Someone's gonna hear you.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.540
Oh, so now I'm embarrassing you?

15:58.624 --> 16:02.669
I've done everything to keep us together!
I called in a freaking bomb threat!

16:03.295 --> 16:05.464
But nothing's good enough. [crying]

16:05.547 --> 16:08.050
I never should've bought you
this stupid bike.

16:09.676 --> 16:11.262
[screaming]

16:11.345 --> 16:13.180
Whoa! Stop, you're gonna hurt yourself!

16:19.020 --> 16:21.605
-Esme!
-[crying] Let go of me!

16:21.688 --> 16:25.234
Think about what you are doing.
It's never too late to ask for help.

16:25.317 --> 16:26.735
[crying]

16:33.034 --> 16:34.576
-[Esme wailing]
-Okay.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.453
[Ms. Grell] I'll take it from here...

16:42.334 --> 16:44.045
Deon Bell. Caltech.

16:44.961 --> 16:46.005
[all applauding]

16:46.088 --> 16:47.631
Congratulations!

16:49.383 --> 16:50.842
[all cheering]

16:51.802 --> 16:53.595
Grace Cardinal. Ryerson.

16:54.388 --> 16:55.931
Congratulations.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.059
Winston Chu. Banting!

17:00.686 --> 17:02.438
Jonah Haak. U of T.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.234
Congratulations.

17:07.318 --> 17:10.654
Miles Hollingsworth.
London Writer's Academy.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.950
Congratulations. Good job.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.328
Maya Matlin. Undecided.

17:20.664 --> 17:24.126
Congratulations. Hold on, not yet.
We gotta do this. [chuckles]

17:24.210 --> 17:25.419
Zig Novak.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.464
Has anyone seen Zig Novak?

17:30.216 --> 17:31.550
Oh, there.

17:31.633 --> 17:32.884
[all applaud]

17:33.635 --> 17:37.306
He's here! He's here. Nice job. Oh, yes.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.183
Next up, our VP, Goldi Nahir.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.893
Recipient of the Service Award,
and attending Banting.

17:41.977 --> 17:44.146
[Goldi] Whoo!
[Simpson] Congratulations.

17:45.106 --> 17:47.233
You sent Grell out?

17:47.316 --> 17:50.319
I told her everything that happened
at prom. Somebody had to.

17:51.695 --> 17:55.407
-She needs real help, Zig. Like I did.
-Last, but not least...

17:55.491 --> 17:57.201
-Zoë Rivas.
-Whoo!

17:57.284 --> 17:59.370
We could not have survived
without your leadership.

18:02.623 --> 18:03.874
Congratulations.

18:09.130 --> 18:11.923
I'd also like to present
an honorary diploma to Tristan Milligan.

18:12.007 --> 18:15.261
His journey has been an inspiration
to the entire community at Degrassi.

18:15.344 --> 18:17.513
-Tristan, get up here.
-[students cheering loudly]

18:20.891 --> 18:22.934
-Congratulations. Good job!
-Thank you.

18:26.938 --> 18:29.566
May I present your graduates!

18:30.526 --> 18:32.528
[all cheering]

18:49.545 --> 18:50.754
What are you doing here?

18:50.837 --> 18:53.174
I'm sorry I accused you
of making the bomb threat.

18:53.257 --> 18:55.759
I was wrong and probably racist.

18:55.842 --> 18:57.511
-Thank you.
-[Lola] Wait!

18:58.429 --> 19:01.307
Um, we'd also like to invite you
to an end-of-year party.

19:02.224 --> 19:05.436
I have to pack. I'm going to stay
with an uncle in Montreal.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.103
But you're coming back, right?

19:07.188 --> 19:10.232
To a school where everyone thinks
I'm a terrorist?

19:10.316 --> 19:13.735
The police questioned me all night.
My parents thought I would be sent home.

19:13.819 --> 19:18.282
-But now everyone knows it was Esme.
-There's nothing for me here.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.493
[breathes shakily]

19:26.498 --> 19:28.124
Now will you come to the party?

19:30.586 --> 19:32.045
[indistinct chatter]

19:33.214 --> 19:35.090
So did you make up your mind
about SoCalArt?

19:35.174 --> 19:36.925
Yeah, actually. I'm gonna try it.

19:37.008 --> 19:39.636
Turns out, not all my decisions
are the worst.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.264
Well, if, uh, you need
someone to drive you,

19:42.348 --> 19:45.892
I don't have any summer plans.
Or fall plans.

19:45.976 --> 19:48.770
-Or winter plans, come to think of it.
-You'll figure it out.

19:50.105 --> 19:52.649
Life isn't a race. You taught me that.

19:56.778 --> 19:58.697
Ready to see what Mom has to say?

20:00.949 --> 20:04.620
So she can try to explain why she doesn't
want me in her life anymore?

20:06.121 --> 20:07.998
I don't care.

20:08.081 --> 20:09.875
I don't need her.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.797
-You're my fam now.
-Speech!

20:15.881 --> 20:18.259
-[all chanting] Speech! Speech! Speech!
-No.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.761
-No! Guys--
-[all continue chanting]

20:22.763 --> 20:24.598
[all cheer]

20:25.766 --> 20:26.767
[Zig] Speech!

20:27.518 --> 20:28.560
[Grace] Go, Zoë!

20:29.144 --> 20:32.398
-Good afternoon, graduates!
-[all laugh]

20:33.315 --> 20:35.567
It seems like just yesterday we were...

20:35.651 --> 20:39.780
scared little kids struggling
to find our lockers,

20:39.863 --> 20:42.491
and today, we're graduates.

20:42.574 --> 20:43.700
[Miles] Whoo!

20:43.784 --> 20:45.911
Along the way,
we welcomed some new faces.

20:45.994 --> 20:48.580
And we said good-bye to others.

20:49.706 --> 20:52.709
When I arrived at Degrassi
as a sophomore...

20:53.794 --> 20:56.380
um, I thought high school was
a competition.

20:56.963 --> 20:59.341
To be the most beautiful.

20:59.425 --> 21:02.719
The most popular.
To score the hottest boyfriend.

21:03.512 --> 21:04.846
Boy, was I wrong. [chuckles]

21:04.930 --> 21:06.848
-Yeah, preach.
-[all chuckle]

21:07.599 --> 21:10.769
I was scared to show people
who I really was, because...

21:11.687 --> 21:14.481
I was afraid that they would reject me.

21:14.565 --> 21:15.857
[inhales deeply]

21:16.858 --> 21:22.823
I've learned that this world is big enough
for all of us to succeed, and...

21:24.533 --> 21:29.621
the only people that we should ever be
competing against is ourselves.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.375
'Kay, thanks, bye.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.126
-[all chuckle]
-Hope we all keep in touch.

21:35.210 --> 21:38.547
You all have bright futures
that I want to hear about.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.549
-Whoo-hoo!
