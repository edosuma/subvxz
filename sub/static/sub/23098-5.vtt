00:05.220 --> 00:07.380
Our world is not always the same.

00:09.480 --> 00:11.040
Hidden from our view

00:11.160 --> 00:12.910
lies a different world.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.400
Creatures utterly unlike us.

00:16.520 --> 00:18.280
THUNDER RUMBLES

00:18.600 --> 00:20.099
Almost alien.

00:22.140 --> 00:23.580
Yet they are more numerous

00:23.687 --> 00:25.646
than any other group on the planet.

00:30.760 --> 00:35.000
Welcome to the fascinating world
of the arthropods -

00:35.120 --> 00:36.600
spiders,

00:36.720 --> 00:38.280
scorpions

00:38.400 --> 00:40.000
and insects.

00:40.320 --> 00:43.080
Today we have new camera techniques

00:43.200 --> 00:47.200
that will allow us to reveal in
greater detail than ever before

00:47.720 --> 00:49.080
their lives.

00:49.200 --> 00:53.120
The way they fight and feed
and reproduce.

00:53.240 --> 00:57.040
This series uses specially developed
3D camera technology

00:57.160 --> 01:00.840
to study the micro world
in extraordinary detail,

01:00.960 --> 01:05.239
both on location and in specially
constructed environments.

01:05.760 --> 01:07.200
We'll witness their births,

01:07.320 --> 01:08.869
the challenges they face

01:09.191 --> 01:12.410
and the moments when their lives
hang in the balance.

01:13.520 --> 01:17.200
And that may help us understand
how it is that today

01:17.420 --> 01:23.860
over 80% of all animal species
on this planet are arthropods.

01:24.280 --> 01:27.320
In this series we'll see
the way they have evolved,

01:27.640 --> 01:31.320
from the comparative simplicity
of the millipede

01:31.640 --> 01:33.040
to vast colonies

01:33.160 --> 01:35.838
that contain hundreds, even
millions, of individuals.

01:37.960 --> 01:40.600
We'll witness the most
extraordinary transformations

01:41.020 --> 01:43.700
in the animal kingdom.

01:44.020 --> 01:46.620
We'll meet ants that farm,

01:46.740 --> 01:49.020
spiders that can cast their webs...

01:51.280 --> 01:54.840
..and the bug that wears the bodies
of its victims as a disguise.

01:57.380 --> 02:00.420
Welcome to a strange
and dangerous world.

02:18.460 --> 02:21.020
The struggle for survival
amongst arthropods

02:21.140 --> 02:22.620
is often brutal

02:22.840 --> 02:25.440
but that's a key to their success -

02:25.660 --> 02:29.420
the strongest survive to produce
the next generation.

02:32.160 --> 02:37.915
The birth of offspring is not always
an end to parental responsibilities.

02:38.760 --> 02:42.080
Whilst most arthropods leave their
young to fend for themselves,

02:42.200 --> 02:45.320
a small minority look after them.

02:45.640 --> 02:47.560
They become families.

02:47.980 --> 02:50.060
And in the tropical forests
of Australia

02:50.380 --> 02:52.463
lives one of the most surprising.

03:00.260 --> 03:03.334
This is the giant
burrowing cockroach.

03:04.620 --> 03:07.060
It is one of the largest
cockroaches in the world.

03:09.260 --> 03:13.620
If you were to hold it, it would
fill the palm of your hand.

03:14.140 --> 03:16.860
Despite its appearance,
it isn't a pest.

03:16.980 --> 03:20.701
In fact, it's one of the most
useful insects in the forest.

03:24.060 --> 03:26.500
Australians call it the litter bug

03:26.620 --> 03:31.321
because it cleans up the forest
floor, eating leaves and detritus.

03:37.740 --> 03:39.460
This one is a female.

03:39.580 --> 03:43.540
She's pregnant and she's digging
a tunnel in order to create

03:43.660 --> 03:47.233
a safe place where she can
produce her young.

03:53.740 --> 03:55.900
Her tunnel is a metre deep,

03:56.320 --> 04:00.160
the equivalent of you or me
digging down more than 20 metres.

04:04.360 --> 04:06.403
And here she gives birth.

04:11.580 --> 04:14.700
Having done so, most insects
would leave,

04:14.820 --> 04:17.731
and their young would be left
to fend for themselves.

04:19.480 --> 04:20.640
But not her.

04:22.680 --> 04:25.480
She will care for her young
for months,

04:25.600 --> 04:28.386
keeping them moist and warm
under her shell.

04:38.840 --> 04:43.199
Occasionally, she'll return to the
surface to collect eucalyptus leaves

04:43.224 --> 04:44.992
for them to eat.

04:55.220 --> 04:58.194
This cockroach will live
for eight years or more.

04:59.700 --> 05:04.053
During that time, she will produce
around 150 young.

05:08.400 --> 05:12.120
And by caring for them for the first
six months of their lives,

05:12.340 --> 05:16.714
she ensures that every one of them
gets the best possible start.

05:20.900 --> 05:25.060
Eventually, they will leave the
nest, and begin life on their own.

05:32.740 --> 05:36.140
But some creatures have taken
social living a step further.

05:36.460 --> 05:39.260
Their youngsters never leave.

05:39.380 --> 05:42.683
The family stays together for life.

05:47.820 --> 05:53.448
This mass of white silk is home
to a very unusual spider.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.480
Spiders are usually solitary.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.920
But these spiders are different -

06:06.140 --> 06:08.260
they're social.

06:08.380 --> 06:10.540
They live in groups of up to 100

06:10.660 --> 06:12.140
and they are all related -

06:12.260 --> 06:15.140
brothers and sisters, parents,
uncles and aunts -

06:15.260 --> 06:17.330
all on the same web.

06:20.680 --> 06:24.470
They live side-by-side,
and hunt together.

06:30.220 --> 06:32.140
Here, too, the mothers care
for their young.

06:33.960 --> 06:37.280
Once these eggs have hatched,
she'll feed the spiderlings

06:37.400 --> 06:41.744
by regurgitating food until they're
old enough to hunt for themselves.

06:44.220 --> 06:47.300
For now, with so many spiders
guarding the web,

06:47.420 --> 06:51.113
it's safe for her to leave the eggs
in search of food.

06:55.260 --> 07:00.517
This mantis is far too large
for any single spider to attack.

07:09.640 --> 07:12.280
So instead, they collaborate.

07:12.400 --> 07:15.598
All the nearby spiders
help to hold it down.

07:22.520 --> 07:26.243
Even the smaller, young spiders
lend a hand.

07:36.480 --> 07:41.080
Eventually when their prey
is exhausted the spiders feed.

07:50.380 --> 07:53.980
It's not unusual for spiderlings
to eat the bodies of older spiders

07:54.100 --> 07:56.063
that have died in the web.

07:58.336 --> 08:01.136
In fact, in some species
of social spider,

08:01.400 --> 08:04.520
the mother always dies
when the spiderlings hatch

08:04.640 --> 08:07.413
and they feed on her corpse.

08:10.960 --> 08:14.960
So the generations pass,
and the family thrives.

08:19.140 --> 08:23.420
This vast web will persist
for perhaps five years,

08:23.540 --> 08:26.652
until eventually the family
moves on.

08:31.860 --> 08:34.380
By living together
as an extended family,

08:34.500 --> 08:36.340
and all looking out for each other,

08:36.460 --> 08:40.767
these social spiders have helped
guarantee their survival.

08:44.560 --> 08:48.840
But some insects have taken this
practice a stage further.

08:48.960 --> 08:52.013
Family members have begun
to specialise.

08:58.140 --> 09:00.020
In the rainforests of Australia,

09:00.340 --> 09:03.944
green ants live in groups
of up to half a million.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.360
But these communities
have small beginnings.

09:14.640 --> 09:18.021
This family consists of just
a few hundred ants.

09:20.200 --> 09:24.068
And they're searching for a place
to build their home.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.085
The family seems to have found
a suitable location.

09:57.460 --> 10:00.098
Now they can start construction.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.500
Climbing on each other's backs,

10:04.720 --> 10:07.440
the strongest ants
reach across the gaps...

10:07.760 --> 10:09.480
and pull the leaves together.

10:21.680 --> 10:25.500
Their nest will be made
by joining these leaves.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.720
But to do that, they need help from
the youngest members of the family -

10:39.840 --> 10:40.920
the larvae.

10:45.380 --> 10:48.740
These tiny white youngsters
are immobile,

10:48.860 --> 10:51.260
but they have a remarkable ability,

10:51.380 --> 10:54.562
which the worker ants have
the skills to stimulate.

10:57.394 --> 11:00.514
When the adult workers stroke them
with their antennae,

11:00.600 --> 11:02.440
the young larvae produce silk.

11:07.560 --> 11:11.132
The workers use the silk
to stitch the leaves together.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.960
Some workers pull the leaves
into position...

11:23.000 --> 11:25.871
..and the delicate silk weaving
continues.

11:37.500 --> 11:40.201
Finally, the nest is complete.

11:47.100 --> 11:52.117
It will provide a strong,
waterproof, safe home for the ants.

11:52.980 --> 11:58.351
But it serves an even more important
purpose, as home to their leader.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.520
Their queen.

12:01.740 --> 12:04.420
She is the mother
of the entire family,

12:04.540 --> 12:06.940
and the sole producer of young.

12:07.460 --> 12:10.765
Without her, the community
will fail.

12:16.218 --> 12:21.098
Arthropods typically produce
their young in huge numbers.

12:21.218 --> 12:24.887
Some look after their offspring,
and stay together as families.

12:26.258 --> 12:29.731
As these families grow in size,
they need organisation.

12:31.618 --> 12:34.578
And many have a central figure,
their mother.

12:37.898 --> 12:39.515
Their queen.

12:44.718 --> 12:46.638
Across Europe and North America

12:46.758 --> 12:48.518
there is an insect that starkly

12:48.638 --> 12:50.078
illustrates the process

12:50.198 --> 12:53.384
by which insect families
choose their queen.

12:55.078 --> 12:57.499
These are paper wasps,

12:57.638 --> 13:01.109
and they live in family groups
of no more than 80 individuals.

13:03.198 --> 13:06.518
The small size of the group
makes them easy to observe.

13:07.638 --> 13:10.444
And shows that the queen
is constantly under threat

13:10.518 --> 13:12.758
from her daughters.

13:12.878 --> 13:14.358
The queen's role is to lay eggs

13:14.478 --> 13:17.398
and keep her unruly daughters
in line.

13:22.698 --> 13:24.698
The daughters tend the young,

13:24.818 --> 13:26.865
their newly-born sisters.

13:30.238 --> 13:31.894
They clean them.

13:33.238 --> 13:35.175
And water them.

13:39.798 --> 13:42.282
They even chop up their food
for them...

13:47.878 --> 13:50.358
..and feed it to them
piece by piece.

13:54.558 --> 13:57.118
And the queen constantly bullies
her daughters

13:57.238 --> 13:58.870
to make sure they do their job.

14:02.338 --> 14:06.378
But in this small family the role
of queen is not fixed.

14:06.498 --> 14:11.588
And deciding who is queen
is settled by aggression.

14:26.838 --> 14:30.199
These tests of strength
have a purpose.

14:35.578 --> 14:38.583
The strongest will become the queen.

14:55.198 --> 14:57.558
To avoid unnecessary fights

14:57.678 --> 15:01.803
the wasps have evolved the ability
to recognise each other by smell.

15:02.938 --> 15:06.418
Some have even learned to recognise
faces, much like humans.

15:08.598 --> 15:13.318
This enables them to constantly
keep track of who has beaten whom,

15:13.438 --> 15:16.488
maintaining this uneasy truce.

15:24.178 --> 15:28.004
But the system only works because
the family is so small.

15:29.898 --> 15:31.218
Just a few more wasps,

15:31.738 --> 15:34.504
and the queen would no longer
be able to fight them all.

15:46.538 --> 15:49.938
Bumblebees have found a way around
this obstacle.

15:53.418 --> 15:56.218
Instead of dominating
by brute force,

15:56.338 --> 15:59.778
their queen controls her family
with chemicals.

16:03.678 --> 16:07.558
Bumblebees are able to live
in larger families of about 300.

16:10.238 --> 16:11.878
The majority are workers,

16:11.998 --> 16:15.556
who collect nectar and pollen
to feed the rest of the family.

16:24.118 --> 16:26.258
And this is their queen.

16:29.438 --> 16:32.278
Her swollen abdomen is full of eggs.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.758
She alone lays...

16:38.598 --> 16:42.453
..so she is the mother
of every bee in the family.

16:49.833 --> 16:52.873
To prevent competition
from her offspring,

16:52.916 --> 16:54.958
she releases a chemical -
a pheromone -

16:55.078 --> 16:59.088
that renders the workers unwilling
to lay eggs themselves.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.422
Unable to produce larvae,

17:03.564 --> 17:06.084
these offspring become
the queen's workers,

17:06.338 --> 17:08.938
looking after the day-to-day
running of their home.

17:12.598 --> 17:15.198
They clean up the debris
at the bottom of the nest.

17:19.338 --> 17:22.738
And build and repair
the nest walls using wax.

17:26.218 --> 17:30.642
They fill and look after special
food stores called honey pots.

17:33.258 --> 17:37.618
They use this honey to feed new
larvae produced by their queen,

17:37.738 --> 17:39.424
their own sisters.

17:41.878 --> 17:44.278
And if any larvae aren't perfect,

17:44.398 --> 17:46.822
the workers will kill them.

17:58.958 --> 18:03.206
The queen's chemical control
of her family is total.

18:09.078 --> 18:14.253
But by the standard of some insect
families, this one is small.

18:23.158 --> 18:25.998
Bumblebees are found all over
the northern hemisphere,

18:26.118 --> 18:29.038
there are about 200 different
species of them.

18:29.158 --> 18:31.238
But pheromones released by the queen

18:31.358 --> 18:36.198
can only control a certain number of
individuals - 100 or so at the most.

18:36.718 --> 18:38.678
To organise bigger colonies,

18:38.798 --> 18:42.038
workers need to be able to send
messages to one another.

18:42.458 --> 18:46.833
It's no longer about control,
it's about communication.

18:53.838 --> 18:55.878
In the rainforests of Africa,

18:55.998 --> 18:59.432
some insects live
in immense families.

19:02.878 --> 19:05.478
By solving the issue
of communication,

19:05.598 --> 19:09.204
their size has become
almost limitless.

19:13.918 --> 19:16.501
These are driver ants.

19:18.798 --> 19:21.198
With up to 50 million individuals,

19:21.318 --> 19:24.921
this is more than just a family.
It's a colony.

19:29.094 --> 19:32.156
the queen is the mother of them all

19:33.427 --> 19:37.027
She is the only individual
that's able to reproduce.

19:38.947 --> 19:42.147
And the entire community,
in their millions,

19:42.267 --> 19:45.325
exists purely in order
to support her.

19:48.727 --> 19:50.807
Like all of the simpler families
we've seen,

19:51.127 --> 19:53.887
their success is built on hierarchy,

19:54.007 --> 19:57.116
and is made possible by
division of labour.

19:59.287 --> 20:01.967
Every ant has a specific role,

20:02.087 --> 20:04.807
whether it's tending to larvae,

20:04.927 --> 20:06.847
guarding the nest,

20:06.967 --> 20:10.931
or guiding a column of its sisters
to a source of food.

20:13.627 --> 20:16.067
But the distance over which
they can operate

20:16.187 --> 20:22.014
- and the sheer size of the family -
is made possible by communication.

20:28.975 --> 20:35.026
Communication is the key to making
a simple family a complex colony.

20:37.347 --> 20:42.384
A collection of insects that is far
greater than the sum of its parts.

20:43.627 --> 20:48.993
And capable of achieving feats equal
to those of far larger animals.

20:52.007 --> 20:54.567
Of all the arthropod innovations,

20:54.687 --> 20:59.647
the most revolutionary has been the
ability to live in immense colonies.

20:59.767 --> 21:02.327
That has enabled them to hunt
en masse,

21:02.747 --> 21:05.747
to build huge constructions
for their homes,

21:05.867 --> 21:08.287
and to dominate their surroundings.

21:12.487 --> 21:16.807
Next time, I want to look at this
pinnacle of arthropod achievement.

21:18.287 --> 21:22.187
Vast colonies capable of shaping
the world around them.

21:23.767 --> 21:27.407
Termites that build castles that,
on our scale,
