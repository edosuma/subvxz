Hey, me and Dale are taking
Bobby's troop up by the lake...

00:05.939 --> 00:08.169
<i>for Order of the Straight Arrow
this weekend.</i>

00:08.241 --> 00:10.402
Y'all want to come, for old time's sake?

00:10.477 --> 00:12.069
Well, of course I'll go.

00:12.145 --> 00:15.239
<i>I'll never miss
an Order of the Straight Arrow.</i>

00:15.548 --> 00:16.810
Not since ours.

00:16.883 --> 00:19.249
Yeah. Ours was something special.

00:20.320 --> 00:23.380
LEADER: Now for the final test.
The snipe hunt.

00:23.456 --> 00:26.948
<i>Not gonna sugarcoat it.
Some of you ain't coming back.</i>

00:27.127 --> 00:29.994
Those who survive will be
honored members...

00:30.063 --> 00:31.963
<i>of the Order of the Straight Arrow.</i>

00:32.031 --> 00:34.023
Those who don't will be dead.

00:35.168 --> 00:37.033
Question. Are you ready?

00:37.137 --> 00:38.229
Yeah!

00:41.374 --> 00:45.640
You flunked the test of silence, Eustace!
Give me your silence stick!

00:47.881 --> 00:51.647
For the rest of your long, miserable life,
you will carry the scar of failure.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.515
Now go get me a beer.

00:55.422 --> 00:57.822
And you boys get out there
and bag some snipe!

00:57.991 --> 00:59.583
[AII yelling]

01:02.796 --> 01:03.820
<i>Snipe!</i>

01:03.897 --> 01:05.660
<i>Shut up, Dale. There is no snipe.</i>

01:05.732 --> 01:07.632
I heard my dad talking to your dad.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.395
<i>So what are we doing out here?</i>

01:09.469 --> 01:11.096
[Muttering] We're gonna get snackered.

01:11.171 --> 01:13.935
I want to get all messed up
and'll just pollute our minds...

01:20.380 --> 01:21.404
[Burps]

01:21.481 --> 01:24.973
When I grow up, I'm gonna drink
this stuff every day, just like my dad...

01:25.085 --> 01:27.747
and fly jets,
and maybe even be an astronaut.

01:27.821 --> 01:32.417
I'm gonna live in London, and be
a rich millionaire, and have people killed.

01:32.859 --> 01:36.022
I'm gonna sell propane
and propane accessories...

01:36.096 --> 01:37.723
if my grades are good enough.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.761
Kids and their crazy dreams.

Well, we're gonna make some men
out of those 12-year-old boys tomorrow...

02:21.740 --> 02:22.832
I tell you what.

02:22.908 --> 02:25.342
But we still get to
play practical jokes, right?

02:25.544 --> 02:28.604
DALE: They're not jokes, Bill.
They're painful lessons.

02:28.747 --> 02:31.739
I thank my father for all
the tricks he played on me.

02:32.050 --> 02:35.383
He taught me the most
wonderful lesson a child can learn.

02:35.454 --> 02:37.183
Never trust nobody.

02:38.524 --> 02:41.118
That's how I know
Bob Dole's been faking that dead arm.

02:41.193 --> 02:42.751
BOOMHAUER: I tell you what you do...

02:42.828 --> 02:45.956
that dang old hand-in-the-water trick
is gonna work every time.

02:46.031 --> 02:48.795
You just put it in the water like that,
and it don't...

02:48.867 --> 02:52.530
you spend the whole dad-gum day like
that, cleaning up that dang old pee-pee.

02:52.604 --> 02:56.062
Yeah. But those are getting tired.
We need some new material.

02:56.408 --> 02:59.400
Dad, can me and Bobby bring
life preservers?

02:59.678 --> 03:01.475
If you want to be sissies.

03:01.647 --> 03:02.978
He said yes.

HANK: Hey, Dale. There's your wife's...
BILL: Healer.

03:07.252 --> 03:10.779
Yeah, John Redcorn.
Let's get some funny Indian stuff to do.

03:10.956 --> 03:12.617
Hey, John Redcorn.

03:12.891 --> 03:15.587
Hank, Dale, Bill, Boomhauer.

03:15.794 --> 03:19.821
<i>John Redcorn, we've got this Order
of the Straight Arrow retreat tomorrow.</i>

03:19.898 --> 03:22.924
- And I was wondering...
- I'd be honored to look after your wife.

03:25.604 --> 03:28.232
Well, thanks.

03:28.307 --> 03:30.298
But what I was really wondering...

03:30.375 --> 03:34.072
is if you had some good Indian stuff
for the ceremony around the campfire.

03:34.346 --> 03:38.783
Our rituals are considered sacred
and are passed down only in the Nation.

03:39.017 --> 03:42.748
- Well, that don't bother us.
- Hell, no. We'll take a sacred one.

03:42.955 --> 03:46.413
There is a very ancient ceremony
I learned from my grandfather...

03:46.492 --> 03:48.892
where we call upon
the sacred Wematanye.

03:48.961 --> 03:51.521
And we ask him to breathe life
into our spirit bag.

03:51.864 --> 03:56.699
<i>Let's see. Spirit bags, Wematanye,
funny-Iooking headband.</i>

03:57.035 --> 03:58.969
The boys are gonna eat this stuff up.

03:59.872 --> 04:03.501
The spirit bag is very sacred.
You should not make light.

04:04.943 --> 04:08.310
I like how you say everything's sacred.
That's funny, too.

04:08.614 --> 04:09.876
Let's do that, Hank.

04:09.948 --> 04:13.748
I got a bunch of L'eggs tennis socks
we can use for spirit bags.

04:13.819 --> 04:15.446
<i>I got them in the divorce.</i>

04:15.521 --> 04:17.785
Now every time she plays,
she gets blisters.

04:18.624 --> 04:20.113
It's been six years, Bill.

04:20.192 --> 04:22.956
<i>Don't you think she'd have
bought some new socks by now?</i>

04:23.629 --> 04:26.598
<i>BOBBY: I want to get that
Straight Arrow patch so bad.</i>

04:26.665 --> 04:30.601
I'm gonna put it right here,
next to my sewing badge.

04:30.669 --> 04:32.694
It's supposed to be hard.

04:33.038 --> 04:35.802
I heard they make you walk on hot coals.

04:35.908 --> 04:37.535
And then you have to eat them.

04:37.609 --> 04:38.598
Ew!

04:38.677 --> 04:40.577
After you walk on them?

04:42.981 --> 04:46.610
- Hell. That's hot.
- Hell. You're not kidding.

04:46.785 --> 04:48.184
<i>BOBBY: Fu...
PEGGY: Pardonnez me.</i>

04:48.253 --> 04:50.221
Did I just hear what I almost heard?

04:50.422 --> 04:53.880
I was gonna say, "Fu-get about it."

04:54.326 --> 04:57.523
<i>Son, Peggy Hill knows half
a swear word when she hears one.</i>

04:57.863 --> 04:58.989
Now go to sleep.

05:00.032 --> 05:02.023
You have the coolest mom.

05:02.234 --> 05:04.429
<i>She smells like Miracle Whip.</i>

05:05.938 --> 05:07.701
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Eustace.

05:07.773 --> 05:09.638
- How you doing?
- Hey, "Useless."

05:10.976 --> 05:11.965
Ha ha.

05:12.444 --> 05:13.604
All right, Randy.

05:13.679 --> 05:16.204
Remember, the purpose of this weekend
is to have fun.

05:16.682 --> 05:20.049
<i>Daddy loves you whether
you get your Straight Arrow patch or not.</i>

05:20.953 --> 05:22.011
What a load.

05:22.087 --> 05:25.921
Can you imagine how I'd have turned out
if my dad had loved me no matter what?

05:25.991 --> 05:28.926
- Thanks for the bus fare, Aunt Peggy.
- Don't be silly, honey.

05:28.994 --> 05:32.521
It's very important that you be there
for your mama. This is her big day.

05:32.598 --> 05:35.066
Actually, her big day is the sentencing.

05:35.133 --> 05:37.897
- This is just the arraignment.
- Here's a Funsaver.

05:37.970 --> 05:39.597
Take lots of pictures.

05:42.874 --> 05:44.239
PEGGY: Well, okay.

05:44.910 --> 05:45.877
There we go.

05:46.011 --> 05:49.276
Have a good time. Here's a Funsaver.
Take lots of pictures.

05:49.348 --> 05:53.717
Gosh, Peg, if I didn't know better,
I'd think you were anxious to see us go.

05:55.420 --> 05:58.480
Well, that is not true.
You and Bobby are my whole life.

05:58.724 --> 06:02.751
<i>Come on, kids! Let's go!
Everybody in the car! Ăndele! Now!</i>

06:02.894 --> 06:05.021
HANK: Hold on, boys. Before we go...

06:05.097 --> 06:08.123
we have to ask the great spirit...

06:08.600 --> 06:12.161
Wematanye, to watch over us on this trip.

06:12.237 --> 06:14.671
- Cool, Indian stuff.
- Wematanye.

06:14.740 --> 06:19.370
This trip is about the sacredness
of Mother Earth and all she gives us.

06:19.845 --> 06:23.110
<i>So pee now, because once
we're on the road, we ain't stopping.</i>

06:23.548 --> 06:24.981
[Engine starting]

06:25.050 --> 06:26.517
<i>I'll see you Sunday, Peg.</i>

06:26.585 --> 06:28.246
Okay. Yeah. All right. Bye-bye.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.010
[Engine stalling]

06:31.023 --> 06:34.151
Damn it. It looks like
we're delayed a couple hours.

06:34.693 --> 06:36.718
I gotta charge up the battery.

06:36.862 --> 06:37.851

06:57.449 --> 07:00.009
Wematanye. Let's spot license plates.

07:00.085 --> 07:01.814
I see Texas, Wematanye.

07:01.887 --> 07:04.048
Wematanye,
there's another Texas, Wematanye.

07:04.122 --> 07:07.683
- Wematanye, I see Texas, Wematanye.
- Oh, God.

07:07.859 --> 07:10.794
Wematanye, Texas, Wematanye.

07:10.929 --> 07:12.863
Would you guys just shut up?

07:12.931 --> 07:15.161
You didn't say "Wematanye."

07:16.601 --> 07:19.695
Boomhauer, pass them. I got an idea.
Pass 'em up.

Okay. The 24-hour
oath of silence starts now.

Here are your silence sticks.

That's what the white man calls them.

07:49.367 --> 07:53.701
Wematanye calls them silence sticks
to test your spirit of shutting up.

07:54.239 --> 07:56.673
Each time you talk, I take a bite.

07:56.808 --> 07:58.571
Talk five times, and you're out.

07:59.111 --> 08:01.306
24-hour silence starting now.

08:07.552 --> 08:08.644
Right now?

08:08.720 --> 08:10.688
Bobby, son, you just talked.

08:11.022 --> 08:13.388
Now, I'll let that pass. But don't talk again.

a bite of your silence stick.

pass your silence sticks up.

<i>See, kids? It's harder than you think.</i>

09:01.740 --> 09:04.174
You don't want to end up like Randy's dad.

09:04.242 --> 09:06.767
My dad's a successful patent lawyer.

09:06.845 --> 09:09.040
Not in the eyes of Wematanye.

I'm still hungry.

09:20.591 --> 09:24.857
Lord, Bobby. Watch out, son.
You've lost more chaws than anybody.

in front of God and everybody.

I'm beginning to think this silence thing
is just so we don't bother them.

10:51.449 --> 10:55.476
They're not testing anything except
for how dumb we are! It's all a trick.

10:55.553 --> 10:57.544
My dad wouldn't trick us!

Wematanye is with you and with Texas.

12:14.598 --> 12:16.031
HANK: Amen.
ALL: Amen.

12:20.671 --> 12:22.366
PEGGY: I'd like a room, please.

12:22.440 --> 12:23.429
Name?

12:23.507 --> 12:26.965
<i>I am Senora Rasha Ibenez.
And I will be paying in cash.</i>

12:28.179 --> 12:31.910
<i>HANK: Now we will say the oath
of the Order of the Straight Arrow.</i>

12:32.016 --> 12:34.985
<i>ALL: A Straight Arrow tells the truth.</i>

12:35.319 --> 12:37.879
<i>A Straight Arrow loves nature.</i>

12:38.356 --> 12:42.622
<i>A Straight Arrow is against Bill HR 57...</i>

12:42.860 --> 12:46.921
<i>to allow the importation
of South American propane.</i>

12:47.198 --> 12:48.825
Wematanye.

12:49.166 --> 12:51.100
And now for the final test.

12:51.168 --> 12:52.965
The snipe hunt.

12:53.037 --> 12:57.474
You are about to come face-to-face
with the deadliest beast in creation.

12:58.175 --> 13:00.473
<i>Those who survive
will be honored members...</i>

13:00.544 --> 13:02.705
<i>of the Order of the Straight Arrow.</i>

13:02.847 --> 13:05.247
And those who don't will be dead.

13:05.316 --> 13:06.305
[Gasping]

13:06.417 --> 13:09.750
Wematanye, protect us on our hunt.

13:10.221 --> 13:12.553
All right.
This here's your whoop-ass stick...

13:12.623 --> 13:15.023
to beat the snipe back
in case he comes at you.

13:15.893 --> 13:17.417
What does a snipe look like?

13:17.661 --> 13:22.189
It's got red, glowing eyes,
long, crooked teeth, a claw...

13:22.266 --> 13:24.700
and a tail with another claw on the end.

13:24.769 --> 13:25.895
[Gasping]

13:26.270 --> 13:29.034
Easy, Dale. Bill and I'll take the lead.

13:29.106 --> 13:31.540
Boomhauer and Dale will bring up the rear.

13:31.609 --> 13:33.907
Remember, the snipe call is this:

13:34.345 --> 13:37.178
"Woo-Ioo-Ioo, woo-Ioo-Ioo."

13:38.282 --> 13:41.115
HANK: Well, call him out, boys.
He's not just gonna show up.

13:41.619 --> 13:43.553
<i>BOYS: Woo-Ioo-Ioo...</i>

13:44.221 --> 13:47.657
- I think I hear him.
- Look out, Bill. He almost got you.

13:50.161 --> 13:51.890
<i>BOYS: Woo-Ioo-Ioo...</i>

13:55.800 --> 13:58.792
They'll be out there another hour,
and then we'll go get them.

13:58.869 --> 14:00.461
Boy, this takes me back.

14:00.638 --> 14:02.128
<i>[Screaming]</i>

14:03.007 --> 14:04.304
BOBBY: I got one!

14:04.375 --> 14:05.501
I got one!

14:05.576 --> 14:08.409
What the... What are you talking about?

14:11.682 --> 14:14.810
HANK: My Lord! That's a whooping crane.

14:14.885 --> 14:18.048
There's only five of those left in the world.

14:18.689 --> 14:20.020
Well, four now.

14:20.090 --> 14:23.059
Then we should be thankful
we got the opportunity to see one.

14:28.132 --> 14:31.966
Now you done it.
Now you really gone and done it.

14:32.036 --> 14:34.596
What do you mean "you"?
We're all in this together.

14:34.672 --> 14:38.608
No, me and Boomhauer
came on our own trip...

14:38.676 --> 14:40.041
in our own conveyance.

14:40.110 --> 14:43.876
You and I may be acquainted,
but we are not traveling companions.

14:44.248 --> 14:48.082
I am merely here to enjoy Earth Day
and play some hacky sack.

14:48.352 --> 14:51.515
Dale, I'm gonna need you
to give me the keys now.

14:54.525 --> 14:56.288
I can't believe it.

14:56.360 --> 15:00.729
It wasn't your fault, Bobby.
You thought it was a snipe. We all did.

15:00.865 --> 15:05.734
It was. But Wematanye
turned it into a whooping crane...

15:05.870 --> 15:09.271
<i>so I could live
to get my Straight Arrow badge.</i>

15:09.406 --> 15:13.638
Bobby, don't you get it?
Your dad made all that up.

15:14.512 --> 15:16.571
There's no such thing as a snipe.

15:16.647 --> 15:19.810
No! My dad is the Arrow leader.

15:19.884 --> 15:22.284
He speaks only with honor.

15:22.520 --> 15:25.785
We'll ditch the carcass
by the interstate in the morning.

15:25.856 --> 15:27.551
Now, let's just go to sleep.

15:27.625 --> 15:31.652
Yes. We'll all just go to sleep now.

15:32.296 --> 15:34.526
Bill, get his pants and shoes.

15:34.932 --> 15:36.331
Okle-doke.

15:36.667 --> 15:38.157
[Electronic sensor beeping]

15:39.436 --> 15:40.494
<i>Sir?</i>

15:40.671 --> 15:42.229
[Beeping getting faster]

15:43.073 --> 15:45.268
<i>Sir, I'm sorry to disturb you.</i>

15:45.342 --> 15:46.934
<i>I'm with the Forestry Service.</i>

15:47.011 --> 15:49.411
And we're looking
for a missing whooping crane.

15:50.381 --> 15:53.316
<i>Well, you see, the bird's tagged
with a little transmitter.</i>

15:53.384 --> 15:56.182
And I've tracked it
to within 10 yards of your campsite.

15:56.253 --> 15:58.380
You haven't seen it, have you?

15:58.455 --> 16:00.582
A whooping crane in these parts?

16:01.091 --> 16:03.457
I think I would've noticed
something like that.

16:03.627 --> 16:07.688
- They're pretty rare, aren't they?
- Yes, very rare and beautiful.

16:08.165 --> 16:10.395
<i>Sir, do you know anything about this?</i>

16:10.467 --> 16:12.697
Due to one of them
snipe hunts last night...

16:12.770 --> 16:14.670
with them sticks and a bag.

16:14.738 --> 16:17.002
And a then whack, whack.
We'd go "woo-Ioo-Ioo."

16:17.041 --> 16:18.804
Talking about that big mistake, y'all.

16:18.876 --> 16:20.068
Right there in that cooler.

16:20.078 --> 16:20.772
Right there in that cooler.

16:21.212 --> 16:25.171
Well, if you do see anything,
you can contact the ranger station.

16:25.249 --> 16:26.409
How about you boys?

16:26.484 --> 16:27.678
Well, yeah. We saw...

16:27.752 --> 16:32.655
<i>They can't talk for 24 hours.
Order of the Straight Arrow, you know?</i>

16:32.824 --> 16:35.315
Got you. I was in the Order myself.

16:35.593 --> 16:36.992
[Mumbling]

16:37.495 --> 16:41.124
<i>The Straight Arrow hasn't changed a bit
since I was a boy.</i>

16:42.266 --> 16:44.496
We gotta get rid of this bird.

16:44.735 --> 16:45.759
What the...

16:45.837 --> 16:47.634
BOBBY: Wematanye.

16:47.972 --> 16:49.337
[Chanting]

16:50.208 --> 16:52.073
HANK: Cripes! Put that thing down!

16:52.310 --> 16:55.404
<i>Stop fooling around!
We've got to bury that thing fast!</i>

16:55.480 --> 16:57.971
We can't just bury it, Dad, remember?

16:58.049 --> 17:01.450
Wematanye wants us to honor
the bird's sacred spirit.

17:01.586 --> 17:04.987
<i>And we will do just that
in the dumpster behind Stuckey's.</i>

17:05.156 --> 17:07.920
Now let's get out of here before
someone sees us, okay?

17:10.528 --> 17:13.622
Murderers! I have got to tell the ranger!

17:23.141 --> 17:25.075
- Brock.
- Rasha.

17:25.810 --> 17:27.539
I almost could not get away.

17:27.612 --> 17:30.172
<i>Amigo, it is time for some new zapatos.</i>

17:30.381 --> 17:32.645
Or "shoes," as you say in your country.

17:32.717 --> 17:37.245
<i>Senora, I have an Italian mock-alligator
you are going to love.</i>

17:37.755 --> 17:41.122
<i>A Size 16 for Senora Ibenez, Triple E.</i>

17:41.792 --> 17:46.229
<i>PEGGY: You are a genius. Now this is why
I come to Lubbock's Very Big Shoes.</i>

17:46.297 --> 17:49.789
I'll have Chuck and Buzz carry
the box out to the car for you.

17:49.867 --> 17:52.233
I saw him waving it
over his head, really proud.

17:52.770 --> 17:55.534
I also heard that
they were hunting snipe last night.

17:55.606 --> 17:57.039
There is no snipe.

17:57.341 --> 18:01.607
My God. How many more species
have to be wiped out before we learn?

18:01.779 --> 18:05.112
Easy. Don't draw attention.
We're almost there.

18:05.183 --> 18:06.582
We're gonna make it.

18:06.651 --> 18:08.414
What's that flapping sound?

18:08.486 --> 18:11.319
Taste the wind one last time, bird spirit.

18:11.389 --> 18:12.378
Bobby!

18:17.895 --> 18:20.796
There they are, the nature haters!
Let's get them!

<i>[Screaming]</i>

18:30.174 --> 18:31.402
[Coughing]

18:33.277 --> 18:35.302
Pull over right here, by that culvert.

18:41.185 --> 18:44.177
Well, we can't stuff this bird in here.
It'll never fit.

18:44.422 --> 18:45.753
You could eat it.

18:45.823 --> 18:48.451
Damn. And I filled up on silence sticks.

18:48.993 --> 18:54.192
Brother Bird, I have given you
a last flight and made my peace with you.

18:54.932 --> 18:57.423
I release your spirit to Wematanye.

18:58.369 --> 18:59.859
Woo-Ioo-Ioo.

19:00.271 --> 19:01.738
Woo-Ioo-Ioo.

19:02.039 --> 19:05.372
<i>HANK: Son, would you please knock it off?
You're driving me nuts.</i>

19:05.443 --> 19:07.240
There is no Wematanye.

19:07.511 --> 19:11.379
It's just some damn nonsense we made up
to fill out the weekend.

19:11.449 --> 19:12.438
<i>Tell him, Dale.</i>

19:12.516 --> 19:15.383
How do you know my name, crane killer?

19:15.453 --> 19:18.547
I never met any of you people
before in my life.

19:19.023 --> 19:22.322
- Tell him, Bill.
- He's right, Bobby. It's all a crock.

19:23.060 --> 19:26.154
Those spirit bags of yours
are just my ex-wife's old socks.

19:26.230 --> 19:28.095
And by the way, I want them back.

19:28.299 --> 19:29.288
<i>So...</i>

19:29.567 --> 19:31.797
everything you said was all a lie?

19:31.869 --> 19:35.464
Yes. That's the secret of the snipe hunt.
That's the whole point.

19:36.474 --> 19:38.601
Oh, I get it.

19:39.744 --> 19:40.733
I guess.

19:41.979 --> 19:45.039
HANK: I didn't mean
to let you down. I just...

19:45.883 --> 19:49.717
When Dale, and Bill, and Boomhauer,
and me went through this as kids...

19:49.787 --> 19:54.053
all the tricks and lies from our dads,
they were part of the experience.

19:54.792 --> 19:57.989
It brought us all together.
You know, us against them.

19:58.062 --> 20:01.293
I don't want to be against you.
You're my dad.

20:01.732 --> 20:04.292
We're supposed to be on the same team.

20:04.368 --> 20:07.496
Of course we're on the same team.
You and me.

20:08.139 --> 20:11.939
And now Team Hill is gonna bury
that whooping crane together...

20:12.009 --> 20:14.671
and get out of this park
without getting caught.

20:14.879 --> 20:16.403
WOMAN: There they are.

20:18.249 --> 20:21.616
<i>Sir, you lied to me.
You lied to this little boy.</i>

20:22.153 --> 20:26.249
And I don't know what you did
to this gentleman in his underwear.

20:26.724 --> 20:29.989
I'm gonna have to take you
in to the ranger station.

20:30.194 --> 20:33.630
<i>Son, hand me the bird body.
I need it for evidence.</i>

20:40.771 --> 20:42.295
It's a miracle!

20:42.640 --> 20:44.437
Well, I'll be damned.

20:44.575 --> 20:46.236
Wematanye.

20:47.812 --> 20:51.009
I guess knocking a crane unconscious
isn't a crime.

20:51.215 --> 20:54.946
Although it's probably not good for them.
You're free to go.

21:04.028 --> 21:06.155
I knew you wouldn't lie to me, Dad.

21:06.530 --> 21:08.498
That was just the final test.

21:08.999 --> 21:11.399
Wematanye does exist.

21:11.469 --> 21:14.165
The bird was just unconscious, Bobby.

21:14.271 --> 21:15.295
No.

21:15.373 --> 21:19.036
It was dead until I made Wematanye
bring it back to life.

21:19.877 --> 21:20.866
I'm a shaman.

21:21.645 --> 21:23.374
God, my head hurts.

21:23.647 --> 21:25.410
I can heal you, Dad.

21:59.950 --> 22:01.383
Did you do some shopping?

22:01.518 --> 22:03.816
Yeah. I bought a microwave.

22:04.388 --> 22:07.551
Boy, I'll tell you what.
This family goes through microwaves...

22:07.624 --> 22:09.990
quicker than most people
go through shoes.
