WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:02.546
MITCH: A year ago,
the animals started acting strangely,

00:02.570 --> 00:04.072
but no one noticed...

00:04.105 --> 00:05.139
(growling)

00:05.173 --> 00:06.316
until they began attacking,

00:06.340 --> 00:08.076
coordinating,

00:08.109 --> 00:09.110
evolving.

00:09.143 --> 00:10.778
The animals were mutating,

00:10.811 --> 00:12.622
and it was happening faster
than anyone expected.

00:12.646 --> 00:13.514
(screaming)

00:13.547 --> 00:16.084
The government came
up with a plan.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.194
PSA NARRATOR: Thanks
to the Noah Objective,

00:17.218 --> 00:19.753
in six to ten years,
the world's animal population

00:19.787 --> 00:22.256
will be thriving once again.

00:22.290 --> 00:25.326
Killing the animals?
Play God and repopulate the planet?

00:25.359 --> 00:26.560
This is ridiculous.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.296
MITCH: But messing
with Mother Nature

00:28.329 --> 00:30.098
could be catastrophic,

00:30.131 --> 00:31.741
so a group of us are
trying to save the animals.

00:31.765 --> 00:34.368
Jackson Oz and Abraham Kenyatta,

00:34.402 --> 00:36.570
animal experts.

00:36.604 --> 00:39.307
Chloe Tousignant,
an intel operative.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.075
Jamie Campbell,

00:41.109 --> 00:43.644
a reporter who's been
following this story, found me,

00:43.677 --> 00:47.047
Mitch Morgan,
a veterinary pathologist.

00:48.249 --> 00:50.451
Together,
we're going to find a cure

00:50.484 --> 00:51.552
for the animals.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.787
Time is running out.

00:54.788 --> 00:56.124
Previously on Zoo...

00:56.157 --> 00:57.825
JACKSON: Our little
secret that what?

00:57.858 --> 00:59.560
My blood's changing?
That I'm changing?

00:59.593 --> 01:01.162
(panting)

01:01.195 --> 01:02.763
We'll keep this
between the two of us.

01:02.796 --> 01:04.598
There's something
I should tell you.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.500
Yeah. There is.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.103
This is where we're going.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.738
JAMIE: Caraquet.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.106
LOGAN: You looked in my bag?

01:12.140 --> 01:14.742
JAMIE: Yeah,
and I saw pictures of me.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.453
LOGAN: It was never about you.
It was about the leopard.

01:16.477 --> 01:18.146
Some guys hired me
to fly them up here.

01:18.179 --> 01:20.614
Where are the guys that hired you?
I don't know.

01:20.648 --> 01:22.259
LOGAN: Somebody's got
to look at your foot.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.452
Oh, wow. That's not good.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.120
(screaming)

01:26.154 --> 01:27.555
DARIELA: What is this thing?

01:27.588 --> 01:29.233
CHLOE: This is how many
animals they expect

01:29.257 --> 01:31.359
to eliminate with
the Noah Objective.

01:31.392 --> 01:33.537
DARIELA: So General Davies
knows his big animal solution

01:33.561 --> 01:35.363
will also kill
millions of people.

01:35.396 --> 01:36.764
We're gonna stop him.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.307
(animals chittering)

01:54.348 --> 01:56.517
(sniffing)

01:58.552 --> 02:00.554
(animal roaring in distance)

02:02.556 --> 02:04.558
(indistinct radio chatter)

02:14.502 --> 02:15.203
(gunshot)

02:15.236 --> 02:17.205
(whimpers)

02:17.238 --> 02:18.606
Prepare the animal for transfer.

02:18.639 --> 02:19.673
Yes, sir.

02:19.707 --> 02:21.775
Get that crate over here.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.585
(scoffs softly)

02:31.619 --> 02:34.455
You know, something tells
me you're still pissed.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.857
You lied to me.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.792
Over and over again.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.528
About your girlfriend dying,

02:40.561 --> 02:41.762
about why you're out here.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.397
That's because I
didn't want you to run,

02:43.431 --> 02:46.367
which you did, anyway.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.312
And for what it's worth,
now I've told you everything.

02:48.336 --> 02:51.305
(animal growling in distance)

02:51.339 --> 02:52.973
(gun cocks) Hey,
what are you doing?

02:53.006 --> 02:54.208
I'm scaring him away.

02:54.242 --> 02:55.385
No, you're ringing
the dinner bell.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.978
They hear that gun go off,
they're all gonna come running.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.214
(sighs)

03:03.584 --> 03:06.620
Why'd you have to
mention dinner?

03:06.654 --> 03:09.357
Now I'm freezing and starving.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.991
This is useless;
everything's soaked.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.926
(sighs)

03:12.960 --> 03:14.295
Not everything.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.364
Not my money.

03:16.397 --> 03:17.197
We have to. No, there's not...

03:17.231 --> 03:18.275
It's the only dry
thing that we have.

03:18.299 --> 03:18.932
No, there's not a chance.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.568
Hey!

03:20.601 --> 03:22.303
We are going to die out here.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.372
It is negative degrees.
We have no shelter.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.774
If we don't get a fire lit soon,

03:26.807 --> 03:28.876
a severed toe is gonna
feel like a massage.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.578
(sighs)

03:37.050 --> 03:38.319
You're right.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.488
We're gonna die out
here, anyway.

03:40.521 --> 03:41.889
Not tonight.

03:43.991 --> 03:46.327
(monitor beeping steadily)

03:46.360 --> 03:50.331
I compared your blood to
our one-armed friend, and...

03:50.364 --> 03:51.599
you have the same mutation.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.601
So I'm gonna end up like him.

03:53.634 --> 03:54.735
Probably.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.338
Blood rain vultures.

03:57.371 --> 03:59.540
Electric ants and Kovacs.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.343
You all have the
same mutated markers

04:02.376 --> 04:03.677
in your genetic sequence.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.713
Can you look straight
ahead, please?

04:10.318 --> 04:12.353
Okay.

04:12.386 --> 04:13.887
Put your shirt on.

04:15.823 --> 04:18.392
(grunts)

04:18.426 --> 04:19.993
How is that even possible?

04:20.027 --> 04:23.431
Humans share 50% of
their DNA with bananas,

04:23.464 --> 04:25.666
so anything's possible.

04:25.699 --> 04:28.369
Including a Triple-Helix.

04:28.402 --> 04:29.202
See that?

04:29.236 --> 04:31.372
That's what normal
DNA looks like.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.642
That's yours.

04:36.677 --> 04:39.913
You and the vultures
and the ants and Kovacs,

04:39.947 --> 04:44.318
you all have brand-new genes
on a brand-new strand of DNA.

04:44.352 --> 04:46.687
I'm evolving.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.857
Well, yeah, but...
not in the good way.

04:49.890 --> 04:53.861
Well, is there a way to fix
me, or is this checkmate?

04:53.894 --> 04:57.731
I might have a way.

04:57.765 --> 05:01.702
See, genes are kind
of like switches.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.604
Right now,
the ones on your new strand,

05:03.637 --> 05:06.940
they're all still off,
and that's a good thing.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.409
But slowly...

05:08.442 --> 05:10.077
(switches clicking)

05:10.110 --> 05:12.112
they're gonna
start to switch on.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.948
And you're gonna
start to change,

05:14.982 --> 05:17.585
until you're not you anymore.

05:17.618 --> 05:20.053
Unless I can figure
out a way to fix it,

05:20.087 --> 05:22.456
keep all your switches off.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.997
So I'm like a phone, and, uh,

05:30.030 --> 05:33.033
need to be restored to
my factory settings.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.503
Is that right? (sniffs)

05:35.536 --> 05:38.105
Well, my metaphor's way
better, but, yeah.

05:38.138 --> 05:41.108
Five weeks,
and Kovacs went from this to that.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.713
So I got five weeks.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.147
I like deadlines.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.181
You know what, Mitch?

05:48.215 --> 05:50.718
Don't worry about me, okay?
Just fix the animals.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.553
Human beings...

05:52.586 --> 05:55.022
genetically...

05:55.055 --> 06:00.428
are the most complex
living organisms, so...

06:00.461 --> 06:03.864
if I can save you,
I can save the animals.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.434
And if you can't?

06:08.001 --> 06:09.670
Checkmate.

06:16.176 --> 06:18.812
(inhales sharply)

06:18.846 --> 06:20.013
(exhales)

06:20.047 --> 06:21.014
Son of a bitch.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.115
Almost done.

06:22.149 --> 06:24.952
Don't want you losing
your whole foot.

06:24.985 --> 06:28.422
Yeah, you just don't
want to carry me.

06:30.524 --> 06:31.492
(chuckles softly)

06:31.525 --> 06:34.094
(exhales)

06:34.127 --> 06:36.830
What makes you so
sure that your friends

06:36.864 --> 06:38.566
are gonna meet you in Caraquet?

06:38.599 --> 06:40.601
Before I took off
from the compound,

06:40.634 --> 06:42.135
I left a message on the roof.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.638
A message?

06:44.672 --> 06:46.674
Caraquet.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.110
I spelled it out in rocks.

06:50.143 --> 06:51.779
You think your friends
are gonna be able

06:51.812 --> 06:55.649
to spot a town name that
you wrote on a roof?

06:55.683 --> 06:58.452
Yeah, they will.

06:58.486 --> 06:59.687
Mitch will.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.656
Mitch?

07:02.690 --> 07:03.657
(sighs)

07:03.691 --> 07:05.626
Yeah.

07:05.659 --> 07:09.630
Well, you sure are putting a
lot of stock in this Mitch guy

07:09.663 --> 07:12.633
if you think he's gonna spot
your little rock message,

07:12.666 --> 07:14.802
know that it was
you who left it,

07:14.835 --> 07:17.004
make his way all
the way to Caraquet.

07:17.037 --> 07:20.140
Well, you don't know Mitch.

07:22.142 --> 07:25.045
(vehicle approaching)

07:25.078 --> 07:26.079
Hey.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.650
Hey! Hey!

07:30.217 --> 07:31.217
(groans)

07:33.153 --> 07:34.822
What are you doing?!

07:35.956 --> 07:37.057
What's wrong with you?

07:37.090 --> 07:38.626
Maybe I didn't tell
you everything.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.194
We need to go.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.806
(footsteps approaching)

07:55.676 --> 07:58.779
Time for a three-to-five
minute break?

07:58.812 --> 07:59.980
I can't.

08:01.682 --> 08:05.085
Does no one on this team sleep?

08:05.118 --> 08:07.220
What are you doing?

08:07.254 --> 08:10.057
Looking for Jamie.

08:10.090 --> 08:13.226
Assuming she travels an average
of three miles per hour,

08:13.260 --> 08:15.763
with roughly ten
hours of daylight,

08:15.796 --> 08:19.199
this should be the search area.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.868
Those are hard miles.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.903
Through the woods, mountains.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.738
With no food and proper gear,

08:24.772 --> 08:26.239
even I'd have
trouble doing that.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.041
Jamie is uncommonly resourceful

08:28.075 --> 08:30.243
for someone who grew
up with shopping malls

08:30.277 --> 08:31.078
and cable TV.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.046
Can't they send an
extraction team?

08:33.080 --> 08:33.881
"They"?

08:33.914 --> 08:36.784
You know,
the people you work for.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.251
The people who gave
you this plane.

08:38.284 --> 08:40.988
We worked for Eleanor Lewis.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.623
Now she's dead.

08:42.655 --> 08:43.791
There is no "they."

08:43.823 --> 08:45.025
You're on your own?

08:47.194 --> 08:49.597
What do you expect to do?

08:49.630 --> 08:50.831
Davies is a general.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.966
Generals have armies.
What do you have?

08:53.000 --> 08:56.737
We found the cure before,
we'll do it again.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.181
Five people stopping
the Noah Objective

08:58.205 --> 08:59.807
and curing the animals?

08:59.840 --> 09:01.609
Kind of a tall order, no?

09:01.642 --> 09:03.110
We can do it.

09:07.781 --> 09:08.982
We're gonna lose.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.984
So you're with us now.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.920
Still haven't decided.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.321
But when I commit
to something...

09:15.856 --> 09:17.958
I'm all in.

09:17.991 --> 09:21.028
Where are you going?

09:21.061 --> 09:24.798
Unlike you people,
I enjoy spending time in bed.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.969
Perhaps I will take
that break after all.

09:32.973 --> 09:35.342
Mitch. I've got something.

09:35.375 --> 09:36.744
Hey, Chloe.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.211
You got to see this.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.848
Mitch found a link
between Kovacs

09:40.881 --> 09:42.983
and the mutated animals.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.688
Does that link include you?

09:47.721 --> 09:48.355
Busted.

09:48.388 --> 09:49.790
Listen, I'm sorry.

09:49.823 --> 09:50.791
We agreed not to tell anyone.

09:50.824 --> 09:51.835
I know what we agreed to, Chloe,

09:51.859 --> 09:53.093
but Mitch agreed... All right.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.762
Ross, Rachel.

09:54.795 --> 09:55.896
I see where this is going.

09:55.929 --> 09:56.940
I'm not interested
in taking that ride.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.799
Women don't like to be lied to.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.668
CHLOE: Moving on.
Everybody knows that.

10:00.701 --> 10:01.468
MITCH: What do you got?

10:01.501 --> 10:03.136
(sighs) So the vultures and ants

10:03.170 --> 10:05.973
found a way to alter
our environment.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.841
I may have found another.

10:07.875 --> 10:10.186
General Davies transferred this
animal to Vancouver yesterday.

10:10.210 --> 10:13.280
According to his report,
it says that this sloth

10:13.313 --> 10:15.916
was capable of creating an
earthquake in Costa Rica.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.852
I'm... sorry. Come again?

10:18.886 --> 10:22.322
Says here the sloth has...

10:22.355 --> 10:23.891
developed a call

10:23.924 --> 10:26.760
that can generate a low
frequency infrasound?

10:26.794 --> 10:27.895
Really?

10:27.928 --> 10:29.697
And that can cause
an earthquake?

10:30.998 --> 10:32.666
I don't know.

10:32.700 --> 10:36.169
I mean, a few years ago at
a football game in Seattle,

10:36.203 --> 10:38.839
the Seahawks fans were
jumping and cheering so much

10:38.872 --> 10:41.374
that it actually registered
on a nearby seismograph.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.977
So you're saying that General
Davies' report is correct?

10:44.011 --> 10:46.246
We need that sloth.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.848
Clearly,
its switch is turned on,

10:47.881 --> 10:49.449
and if I can
understand his switch,

10:49.482 --> 10:50.884
might be able to
figure out a way

10:50.918 --> 10:52.328
to keep yours from
turning on at all.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.097
You think this little guy
has got the Triple-Helix?

10:54.121 --> 10:55.923
I'd put money on it.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.324
And understanding
the Triple-Helix,

10:57.357 --> 10:58.926
that's the key to
saving your life.

10:58.959 --> 11:02.896
Which is why your boyfriend
was right in telling me.

11:05.966 --> 11:08.301
Let's go get our sloth.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.945
Is it safe?

11:17.978 --> 11:18.946
Yes.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.948
The case is soundproof.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.225
Is the jungle gym
really necessary?

11:22.249 --> 11:24.017
We're trying to keep it happy.

11:24.051 --> 11:26.419
Just in case.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.922
(rumbling)

11:28.956 --> 11:29.999
I thought you said it was safe!

11:30.023 --> 11:31.491
It is!
The sloth isn't causing this.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.524
Something is. Everybody out!
Evacuate the building!

11:36.496 --> 11:38.866
(people screaming)

11:54.815 --> 11:56.316
Just drive. All right, sir.

11:57.985 --> 11:59.052
(tires screeching)

12:09.262 --> 12:11.031
(urgent chatter)

12:16.870 --> 12:19.106
You're sure this is the place?

12:19.139 --> 12:21.074
CHLOE: This is the address
on the transfer order.

12:21.108 --> 12:24.177
Looks like someone
got here first.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.213
(screeching)

12:29.149 --> 12:32.452
♪

13:05.152 --> 13:07.988
(helicopter whirring)

13:08.021 --> 13:09.990
(car horns honking,
sirens wailing)

13:10.023 --> 13:11.324
JACKSON: Well, if the sloth

13:11.358 --> 13:13.026
was in there, it's dead.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.862
We don't know that.

13:16.296 --> 13:19.066
Um, I'm missing something.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.934
Why is it so important?

13:20.968 --> 13:22.369
Yeah, listen, Abe,

13:22.402 --> 13:23.947
there's something that
you should know...

13:23.971 --> 13:26.439
Mitch thinks the sloth
can help make a cure.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.475
Well,
if it's the sloth we're after,

13:28.508 --> 13:31.278
all we need is to walk in
the rainforest of Brazil.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.156
At their speed,
even you could catch one, rafiki.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.481
We need this sloth.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.225
We've confirmed it has
an advanced mutation.

13:36.249 --> 13:37.217
DARIELA: An eyewitness

13:37.250 --> 13:38.585
saw military trucks.

13:38.618 --> 13:40.053
Davies was here. Looks that way.

13:40.087 --> 13:42.055
They loaded a large
crate and sped off

13:42.089 --> 13:43.056
just before an earthquake hit.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.925
That sounds like the sloth.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.227
You think this was
caused by a sloth?

13:47.260 --> 13:49.029
MITCH: Yep, and he had help.

13:49.062 --> 13:50.898
You guys got to see this.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.566
Moles.

13:55.102 --> 13:56.403
Moles?

13:56.436 --> 13:58.305
Yeah.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.040
We got moles.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.942
Moles and sloths.

14:01.975 --> 14:05.045
Sounds like my dating
life after I got divorced.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.422
JACKSON: Those tunnels
look a little large

14:06.446 --> 14:08.415
to be mole tunnels.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.517
That's why I said moles, plural.

14:10.550 --> 14:14.254
Very plural.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.522
Phenomenal creatures.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.590
You know, they...
they smell in stereo.

14:17.624 --> 14:20.293
They got these sensory
receptors on their nose.

14:20.327 --> 14:21.995
They're called Eimer's organs.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.163
Amazing.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.431
You're sure it's moles?

14:24.464 --> 14:25.498
Yeah.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.611
See how these scratch
marks are spaced out?

14:28.635 --> 14:30.370
Moles are polydactyl.

14:30.403 --> 14:31.647
Means they-they've
got an extra thumb.

14:31.671 --> 14:33.907
Well, it's actually an
extended wrist bone,

14:33.941 --> 14:35.943
acts like a thumb for digging.

14:35.976 --> 14:39.112
Okay, mole fetish aside,
you really think that moles

14:39.146 --> 14:40.647
attacked that building?

14:40.680 --> 14:42.649
Yes, I do.

14:42.682 --> 14:46.519
It speaks to a whole new,
higher level of mutation,

14:46.553 --> 14:48.956
because moles, they work alone.

14:48.989 --> 14:51.491
They only come
together to procreate.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.626
Something we should
all strive for.

14:53.660 --> 14:57.064
They brought down one
building in a very large city.

14:57.097 --> 15:00.100
Do you think they were
targeting the Noah Objective?

15:00.133 --> 15:01.568
My guess is they were following

15:01.601 --> 15:04.371
the low-frequency
vibration of the sloth.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.406
(animal roaring in distance)

15:07.707 --> 15:10.510
All in favor of a swift exit?

15:12.279 --> 15:14.014
No.

15:16.449 --> 15:19.919
We got to follow the
moles to get the sloth.

15:22.622 --> 15:25.192
Logan, wait!

15:25.225 --> 15:26.659
We have to keep going.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.661
No. I want to know
what's going on.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.263
Are those the guys
that hired you?

15:30.297 --> 15:31.064
Yes.

15:31.098 --> 15:33.133
Well, just tell them the truth.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.567
Tell them the leopard's gone.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.503
It's more complicated than that.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.738
I'm not moving until you
tell me what's going on.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.507
You're gonna get us killed.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.509
No, I'm gonna find
a place to sit down.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.978
'Cause, uh,
running around on nine toes

15:45.012 --> 15:46.446
kind of takes it out of a girl.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.681
Okay, okay, okay, fine.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.251
They paid me.
They hired me, like I said.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.253
But they only paid me ten grand.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.730
You had a whole lot more
than that in that bag.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.389
I know. It wasn't mine.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.691
It's a down payment
from the buyer.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.760
You're a thief. No.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.163
I'm a dead man and so are you

16:03.196 --> 16:05.332
if they find out that
we burned their money.

16:05.365 --> 16:08.268
I mean, not a man,
but a, you know...

16:08.301 --> 16:09.536
You'll be dead.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.104
All right, just...

16:11.138 --> 16:13.006
They can't find us.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.607
Let's go.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.709
Hi, Logan.

16:16.743 --> 16:20.013
You have something
that belongs to us.

16:20.047 --> 16:22.982
We'd like it back now.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.724
I don't hear any animals.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.260
Do moles make a noise?

16:33.293 --> 16:34.627
Yeah.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.563
High-pitched squeak.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.641
Kind of like the ones I've been
hearing from Abe's room lately.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.368
Keep moving.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.570
Mitch, you sure these
things can't cave in on us?

16:43.603 --> 16:45.372
No.

16:45.405 --> 16:46.806
Moles are very precise

16:46.839 --> 16:48.408
little architects.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.110
All they do is work.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.045
You know,
the more you talk about moles,

16:52.079 --> 16:54.814
the more I understand you.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.216
What are you trying to say?

16:56.249 --> 16:57.150
JACKSON: She's trying to say

16:57.184 --> 16:59.686
that you love moles
because you are one.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.688
And I have to agree.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.590
Hey, Chloe,
we're flying blind here.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.592
Okay, I'm accessing
your transponders.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.627
Should have eyes on you.

17:10.396 --> 17:12.632
Now, start rolling VPNs.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.666
I don't even know what a VPN is.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.669
Virtual Private Network.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.106
I'm gonna use Davies'
satellite to track the team.

17:19.138 --> 17:21.308
You need to make sure
Davies doesn't track us.

17:21.340 --> 17:23.576
If he runs a trace,

17:23.609 --> 17:25.545
could we reverse it,

17:25.578 --> 17:26.646
find his location?

17:26.679 --> 17:29.149
No, they're using an
encrypted firewall.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.850
It will be like
breaking into the CIA

17:30.883 --> 17:33.353
using a bobby pin.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.722
If you have access to all this,

17:35.755 --> 17:37.624
can't you get a satellite

17:37.657 --> 17:39.326
over New Brunswick?

17:39.359 --> 17:41.394
For Jamie. (chuckles)

17:41.428 --> 17:42.795
You're brilliant.

17:42.829 --> 17:46.199
I just hope she's holding
her own out there.

17:47.667 --> 17:50.737
I don't see any money.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.573
I swear we tossed it
when we started running.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.742
Just figured you
guys would find it.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.377
Well, we didn't.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.778
And if we don't,

17:58.811 --> 18:01.548
I'm gonna throw you off a cliff.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.159
He's telling the truth.
I watched him do it.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.717
(faint screeching)

18:04.751 --> 18:07.220
It sounds like the
clock's ticking.

18:07.254 --> 18:08.621
You got to believe us.

18:08.655 --> 18:09.689
(chuckles)

18:09.722 --> 18:11.191
Know what I think?

18:11.224 --> 18:13.593
You two been working together

18:13.626 --> 18:14.861
the whole time.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.263
MAN; Hey, Mace!

18:16.296 --> 18:19.199
I found it a mile back.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.501
Next to a burned-out campfire.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.536
(laughs)

18:25.938 --> 18:28.741
You burnt the money?

18:28.775 --> 18:31.444
It was my idea.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.546
We needed to not
freeze to death.

18:33.580 --> 18:36.916
(laughs)

18:36.949 --> 18:38.818
Nice try.

18:38.851 --> 18:42.389
It's a good way to throw us
off, but I'm not buying it.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.123
Tell you what, though.

18:45.825 --> 18:49.662
I don't need two of you
to show me where it is.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.498
Please...

18:51.531 --> 18:53.466
I will get you your money, okay?

18:53.500 --> 18:55.268
Too late.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.304
(gunshot)

18:58.371 --> 18:58.938
MAN: Watch out!

18:58.971 --> 19:00.607
(barking, snarling)

19:00.640 --> 19:02.842
(men screaming)

19:20.993 --> 19:23.330
(muffled growling)

19:23.363 --> 19:24.831
That's not good.

19:24.864 --> 19:27.667
Hey, what do you see up there?

19:32.805 --> 19:35.342
Uh...

19:35.375 --> 19:37.477
we have a little problem.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.513
Actually about a
thousand little problems.

19:40.547 --> 19:41.781
What is it?

19:42.982 --> 19:45.585
Wall of dead moles.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.887
Hey, Chloe?

19:47.920 --> 19:50.290
We've hit a dead end.

19:50.323 --> 19:51.824
Literally.

19:59.466 --> 20:00.667
Sir.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.868
As you were.

20:01.901 --> 20:04.471
Someone just accessed
Eleanor Lewis' login.

20:04.504 --> 20:05.544
I thought it was disabled.

20:05.572 --> 20:06.539
It was.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.575
Show me what they're looking at.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.711
Okay, give me a second.

20:11.744 --> 20:12.984
We have two problems, actually.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.981
They know we're using
their satellites.

20:15.014 --> 20:16.683
They'll be starting their trace.

20:16.716 --> 20:17.993
Uh, I can hold them
off for a while.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.452
But then what?

20:19.486 --> 20:21.388
Plan B.

20:21.421 --> 20:22.555
Which is?

20:22.589 --> 20:23.856
Not sure yet.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.892
(grunting)

20:28.828 --> 20:30.830
Here.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.532
I'm not touching that.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.933
I need a sample.

20:33.966 --> 20:35.668
Oh, man.

20:35.702 --> 20:38.738
(grunts)

20:38.771 --> 20:39.906
(groans)

20:39.939 --> 20:41.841
All right, Chloe,
there's no trail left.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.643
We're coming out.

20:43.676 --> 20:44.853
They almost have a
lock on our location.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.413
That's the least
of our concerns.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.448
They have logged
into the satellite.

20:48.481 --> 20:49.782
Davies can see what we see.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.360
If Davies knows where they
are, he'll send a team.

20:51.384 --> 20:52.652
Get them out!

20:52.685 --> 20:54.387
Okay, uh, Mitch?

20:54.421 --> 20:56.456
I need you...

21:00.059 --> 21:01.794
I need you to keep going.

21:01.828 --> 21:03.596
What are you doing?!

21:03.630 --> 21:04.731
Initiating plan B.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.633
Chloe,
there's nothing left to follow.

21:06.666 --> 21:07.767
I need you to keep moving.

21:07.800 --> 21:08.801
Keep moving where, Chloe?

21:08.835 --> 21:09.736
Where are we headed?

21:09.769 --> 21:11.671
Come on,
what do you want us to do next?

21:11.704 --> 21:14.307
Hold on,
I'm about to find the sloth.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.677
(growling)

21:17.710 --> 21:19.312
MITCH: Oh, God! Go back!

21:19.346 --> 21:20.713
Go back! Go back!
Go back! Go back!

21:20.747 --> 21:22.582
(gasping)

21:22.615 --> 21:24.551
Oh, crap!

21:31.891 --> 21:33.436
MITCH: Chloe,
find us a way out of here!

21:33.460 --> 21:34.327
I need another minute.

21:34.361 --> 21:35.362
We don't have a minute!

21:35.395 --> 21:36.729
There's an alligator down here!

21:36.763 --> 21:38.498
Did he say "alligator"?

21:38.531 --> 21:40.667
Okay, okay!
Finding a way out now!

21:42.001 --> 21:43.035
There's an exit!

21:43.069 --> 21:44.571
It's a few yards behind you,

21:44.604 --> 21:46.038
but you'll have to
dig your way out.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.407
MITCH: Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

21:47.440 --> 21:48.441
Jackson, move!

21:48.475 --> 21:50.009
JACKSON: I'm trying!

21:52.512 --> 21:53.513
We've got a location.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.583
They're underground.

21:56.616 --> 21:58.618
Trying to follow
the moles to us.

21:58.651 --> 21:59.519
What should we do?

21:59.552 --> 22:01.120
Get rid of 'em.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.922
(men shouting)

22:06.693 --> 22:08.695
(tires squealing)

22:15.468 --> 22:17.470
(snarling)

22:24.577 --> 22:25.545
Chloe?

22:25.578 --> 22:26.779
I don't see it.

22:26.813 --> 22:28.424
Where is it?
CHLOE: There's an access tunnel

22:28.448 --> 22:29.482
right in front of you.

22:29.516 --> 22:30.617
I think I got a shot!

22:30.650 --> 22:31.618
MITCH: Are you crazy?!

22:31.651 --> 22:33.119
Jackson, dig faster!

22:33.152 --> 22:35.988
I'm going as fast as I can!

22:36.022 --> 22:37.490
(alligator snarling)

22:37.524 --> 22:39.459
(grunting)

22:39.492 --> 22:40.527
I got it!

22:40.560 --> 22:42.128
MITCH: Go, go, go!

22:53.540 --> 22:54.841
Got it!

22:54.874 --> 22:56.743
We got it!

22:56.776 --> 22:59.679
(grunting)

22:59.712 --> 23:01.147
(Dariela grunts) Come on.
I got you.

23:01.180 --> 23:02.482
I got you.

23:02.515 --> 23:03.483
You okay?

23:03.516 --> 23:04.417
(grunts)

23:04.451 --> 23:06.118
Come here. (both grunt)

23:06.152 --> 23:08.120
(alligator snarling)

23:08.154 --> 23:10.156
(rumbling)

23:11.090 --> 23:12.759
Mitch! Mitch!

23:12.792 --> 23:13.760
CHLOE: What's happening?

23:13.793 --> 23:15.633
JACKSON: The tunnel collapsed.
Mitch is inside.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.432
Mitch! Mitch!

23:19.466 --> 23:20.600
Come on. Mitch!

23:20.633 --> 23:22.435
JACKSON: Come on. Come on!

23:24.070 --> 23:25.070
Mitch!

23:26.906 --> 23:28.441
Mitch!

23:28.475 --> 23:30.477
Mitch! Come on.

23:30.510 --> 23:32.211
We got you! Come on.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.481
(both grunt)

23:34.514 --> 23:36.015
Come on. I've got you!

23:36.048 --> 23:37.950
There you go!

23:37.984 --> 23:39.719
There you go, there you
go, there you go.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.020
(gasps) There you go.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.124
We got him!

23:45.157 --> 23:47.026
What happened to that alligator?

23:47.059 --> 23:48.595
I don't know.

23:48.628 --> 23:49.562
You want to go back
in and look for him?

23:49.596 --> 23:51.664
Chloe, get us out of here.

23:51.698 --> 23:53.733
CHLOE: Okay. Stand by.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.034
Davies knows where they are.

23:55.067 --> 23:57.136
That's what I'm counting on.

23:59.839 --> 24:00.840
Where are you, Davies?

24:09.081 --> 24:10.082
Got him.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.584
Cut the connection, Abe.

24:11.618 --> 24:14.086
Jackson, there's an exit
ten meters behind you.

24:16.188 --> 24:17.657
What was that about?

24:17.690 --> 24:19.692
It was about getting
Davies' location.

24:19.726 --> 24:20.693
And I did.

24:20.727 --> 24:22.962
Plan B.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.497
B for "bait."

24:26.666 --> 24:27.634
What?

24:27.667 --> 24:29.569
Where were they coming from?

24:30.737 --> 24:32.605
Reiden Global.

24:38.878 --> 24:41.113
(wolves bark and
snarl in distance)

24:45.217 --> 24:47.086
(gasps)

24:48.721 --> 24:49.722
(grunts)

24:54.293 --> 24:55.595
Where's my money?

24:55.628 --> 24:58.665
We burned it.

24:58.698 --> 24:59.698
(grunts) (groans)

25:06.806 --> 25:07.940
(screams)

25:07.974 --> 25:08.974
(yells)

25:09.976 --> 25:10.977
(Mason grunts)

25:20.820 --> 25:23.623
(wolves howling)

25:28.828 --> 25:32.565
So, we are officially
looking at foul play.

25:32.599 --> 25:33.800
What do you mean?

25:35.868 --> 25:37.670
Mass mole execution.

25:37.704 --> 25:39.205
How?

25:39.238 --> 25:41.540
Somebody turned those
tunnels into a gas chamber.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.745
Well,
it had to have been Davies.

25:45.778 --> 25:46.879
Davies must have known

25:46.913 --> 25:49.215
that the moles were
following the sloth

25:49.248 --> 25:50.993
and took them out before they
could create another sinkhole.

25:51.017 --> 25:54.721
I did some analysis on the gas.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.623
Not like anything
I've ever seen before.

25:56.656 --> 25:58.691
And with airborne distribution?

25:58.725 --> 26:00.627
Perfect way to cull the animals.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.061
And, since we're still standing,

26:02.094 --> 26:03.854
it doesn't seem to have
any affect on humans.

26:05.231 --> 26:08.701
Or half-humans, apparently.

26:08.735 --> 26:09.535
Maybe.

26:09.568 --> 26:12.639
I mean, the gas is
fast-acting, but...

26:12.672 --> 26:14.674
might have just been
really lucky timing.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.609
Don't do that. Hmm?

26:16.643 --> 26:17.644
(exhales)

26:17.677 --> 26:18.721
I thought about it, and, uh,

26:18.745 --> 26:20.146
I gotta tell Abe
about my condition.

26:20.179 --> 26:21.289
All right?
He has the right to know.

26:21.313 --> 26:22.281
What, are you crazy?

26:22.314 --> 26:23.750
Even for a half-man,

26:23.783 --> 26:25.317
that is a full bad idea.

26:25.351 --> 26:27.319
Nothing against
your bosom buddy,

26:27.353 --> 26:28.387
but his bosom buddy?

26:28.420 --> 26:29.856
Not too fond of mutants.

26:29.889 --> 26:31.624
Abe is like a brother to me.

26:31.658 --> 26:33.726
Dariela was friends with
Kovacs, right?

26:33.760 --> 26:35.027
She still shot him in the head.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.631
That's true.

26:38.665 --> 26:39.966
That's a fair point.

26:39.999 --> 26:42.635
Anyway, that's a
five-week-from-now problem.

26:42.669 --> 26:44.103
Davies has a gas

26:44.136 --> 26:46.706
that he can use to
kill with prejudice.

26:46.739 --> 26:47.850
Clearly,
he's not afraid to use it.

26:47.874 --> 26:50.777
And we are trying to restore
things to factory settings,

26:50.810 --> 26:52.779
and this sicko just
wants to buy a new phone.

26:52.812 --> 26:55.347
About 20 quintillion new phones.

26:55.381 --> 26:56.859
And the best chance
we have to stop him

26:56.883 --> 26:59.185
is inside the walls
of Reiden Global.

27:07.226 --> 27:09.896
It wasn't easy, but we're in.

27:11.998 --> 27:13.700
I hacked into the security feed.

27:13.733 --> 27:14.701
CHLOE: Good work, guys.

27:14.734 --> 27:17.236
When General Davies
deployed men to the tunnels,

27:17.269 --> 27:18.938
this is where they came from,

27:18.971 --> 27:21.140
so it's a good bet he's
keeping the sloth here.

27:21.173 --> 27:23.275
If I were a
four-star psychopath,

27:23.309 --> 27:24.443
where would I hide a sloth?

27:24.476 --> 27:26.679
Maybe...

27:26.713 --> 27:27.714
There.

27:29.381 --> 27:30.817
But how did he open the door?

27:30.850 --> 27:33.820
No retinal scan or fingerprint.

27:33.853 --> 27:35.755
Some kind of voice recognition?

27:35.788 --> 27:37.223
CHLOE: It was his heart-print.

27:37.256 --> 27:38.224
His what?

27:38.257 --> 27:39.692
It recognizes his heartbeat.

27:39.726 --> 27:40.893
Every person's is unique.

27:40.927 --> 27:42.394
So to get through this door,

27:42.428 --> 27:44.163
we're going to need
this man's heart?

27:44.196 --> 27:45.264
Piece of cake.

27:45.297 --> 27:46.866
Looks like he's going out.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.735
We should go out with him.

27:48.768 --> 27:50.008
CHLOE: Or maybe he's staying in.

27:50.036 --> 27:51.738
Only Reiden would throw a party

27:51.771 --> 27:52.891
during the end of the world.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.308
That's Senator Rowan.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.778
And Jonas Hofler.

27:58.811 --> 27:59.946
They're IADG leaders.

27:59.979 --> 28:01.180
DARIELA: I-what?

28:01.213 --> 28:03.149
ABE: International
Animal Defense Group.

28:03.182 --> 28:06.318
Everyone you'd need to pass
a vote on the Noah Objective

28:06.352 --> 28:08.020
is in that room.

28:08.054 --> 28:09.856
The fact that they
are all here...

28:09.889 --> 28:11.323
Means they're ready to vote.

28:11.357 --> 28:13.125
Davies must be moving
up the timeline.

28:16.128 --> 28:17.429
There he is.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.398
Watch your back, science man.

28:19.431 --> 28:21.768
CHLOE: We need to
get into that party.

28:21.801 --> 28:22.902
Get the heart-print.

28:22.935 --> 28:25.037
ABE: That party? Yes.
We need to get the heart-print

28:25.071 --> 28:27.740
while he's busy
talking to the VIPs.

28:27.774 --> 28:28.884
We're gonna crash
the party of the guy

28:28.908 --> 28:30.018
who just sent men to kill us?

28:30.042 --> 28:31.042
Yes.

28:39.251 --> 28:41.253
(indistinct chatter)

28:51.831 --> 28:52.832
Oh, yeah.

28:58.170 --> 28:59.138
Mitch is in.

28:59.171 --> 29:00.506
Are we clear to enter?

29:03.843 --> 29:05.011
Not yet. Stand by.

29:05.044 --> 29:06.278
Two minutes.

29:16.322 --> 29:18.524
Look, I know you're still
upset about me telling Mitch,

29:18.557 --> 29:20.392
and... I had to.

29:20.426 --> 29:21.861
It was the right thing to do.

29:21.894 --> 29:22.995
He can help. I'm not upset.

29:23.029 --> 29:24.130
(chuckles)

29:24.163 --> 29:25.331
You've barely spoken to me.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.499
I was ready to
quit, back in D.C.,

29:27.533 --> 29:29.068
but I came back because of you.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.904
My only thought was to fix
you, save you.

29:31.938 --> 29:32.948
Yeah, that's... not your job

29:32.972 --> 29:35.041
or your responsibility.

29:35.074 --> 29:36.876
It wasn't your responsibility

29:36.909 --> 29:38.310
to save me in Africa.

29:38.344 --> 29:40.146
Actually, it was.

29:40.179 --> 29:41.313
I was a safari guide.

29:43.883 --> 29:46.819
I was so scared.

29:46.853 --> 29:48.120
And then you appeared.

29:49.856 --> 29:51.157
And you were still scared.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.259
A little less.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.137
I knew that everything
was going to be all right.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.930
That's your superpower, Jackson.

29:57.964 --> 29:59.832
You have a way of
making people feel

29:59.866 --> 30:01.467
that everything's
gonna be all right.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.469
No matter how
dreadful things look.

30:06.205 --> 30:09.441
I know that my responsibility
is to our mission,

30:09.475 --> 30:11.077
but I need to find a balance

30:11.110 --> 30:13.145
between being the
leader of this team

30:13.179 --> 30:15.181
and being in love with you.

30:23.956 --> 30:25.457
DARIELA: We're good to go.

30:28.127 --> 30:29.996
Jackson, Chloe, do you copy?

30:31.663 --> 30:32.631
Y... uh, yeah.

30:32.664 --> 30:33.632
(clears throat)

30:33.665 --> 30:35.034
Yeah. Yeah, we copy.

30:37.970 --> 30:38.938
(clears throat)

30:38.971 --> 30:42.008
(indistinct chatter)

30:49.348 --> 30:52.018
Excuse me.

30:53.319 --> 30:54.653
Ringo's approaching the stage.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.422
Target's at your ten.
(clears throat)

30:58.224 --> 30:59.191
Hey...

30:59.225 --> 31:00.259
Hi!

31:00.292 --> 31:01.260
So glad that you could make it.

31:01.293 --> 31:03.195
Yeah. Uh... me, too.

31:03.229 --> 31:04.931
(laughs) He doesn't
know who we are.

31:04.964 --> 31:05.932
Ken Adams.

31:05.965 --> 31:06.933
And Emma Simone. Emma Simone.

31:06.966 --> 31:08.134
We work with General Davies.

31:08.167 --> 31:10.569
Yeah. He's had so
many wonderful things

31:10.602 --> 31:12.038
to say about you.

31:12.071 --> 31:13.039
He's very impressed
by your work.

31:13.072 --> 31:14.673
And so am I.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.142
Well, keep it up.

31:16.175 --> 31:18.144
Everyone's proud of you.
Yeah, good work.

31:18.177 --> 31:20.246
(clears throat)

31:20.279 --> 31:22.514
Gentlemen,
the package has been delivered.

31:22.548 --> 31:23.682
Post up by the bathroom.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.117
He should be heading your way

31:25.151 --> 31:27.653
with the stomachache
of a lifetime.

31:27.686 --> 31:30.056
Are you sure this
is going to work?

31:31.290 --> 31:33.993
Just slipping him a mickey.

31:34.026 --> 31:36.395
What do you know about
"slipping a mickey"?

31:36.428 --> 31:38.497
Oh, I can slip a mickey, okay?

31:38.530 --> 31:41.067
I'm a doctor, for God's sake.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.935
So they teach you
mickey-slipping

31:42.969 --> 31:44.070
in doctor school?

31:44.103 --> 31:45.571
Just... I...

31:45.604 --> 31:47.139
I know that trusting my judgment

31:47.173 --> 31:48.474
isn't one of your strong suits,

31:48.507 --> 31:51.110
but maybe just this once,
give it a shot, huh?

31:51.143 --> 31:53.545
Dr. Heart-Print

31:53.579 --> 31:56.215
will be coming our
way any second now.

31:56.248 --> 31:57.984
DAVIES: Ladies and gentlemen,

31:58.017 --> 31:59.351
I'm happy to welcome you here

31:59.385 --> 32:00.987
on this special night.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.055
Now, I know many of you

32:03.089 --> 32:05.557
are still clinging to the hope

32:05.591 --> 32:07.659
that the "animal
problem" will somehow

32:07.693 --> 32:09.061
rectify itself.

32:09.095 --> 32:10.196
I, unfortunately, am here

32:10.229 --> 32:13.732
to share with you that things
have gotten a lot worse.

32:13.765 --> 32:17.669
Ladies and gentlemen,
we must stop these animals.

32:17.703 --> 32:20.339
We finally have
the means to do so.

32:20.372 --> 32:21.340
(animals growling)

32:21.373 --> 32:24.510
Allow me to introduce TX-14.

32:24.543 --> 32:26.512
A two-part gas.

32:26.545 --> 32:29.148
A fast-acting elimination agent

32:29.181 --> 32:30.716
and a neutralizer.

32:30.749 --> 32:32.651
Which, when they combine,

32:32.684 --> 32:34.420
forms a compound

32:34.453 --> 32:37.089
that only targets the mutation.

32:37.123 --> 32:38.357
(animals groaning)

32:38.390 --> 32:39.725
Human beings will be safe,

32:39.758 --> 32:43.029
but every animal with
the mutation will be...

32:43.062 --> 32:44.496
destroyed.

32:47.099 --> 32:48.334
Tomorrow before the vote,

32:48.367 --> 32:51.170
we will give you a demonstration
of the efficiency and the safety

32:51.203 --> 32:52.171
of this gas.

32:52.204 --> 32:55.407
But tonight enjoy yourselves.

32:55.441 --> 32:57.643
Get to know one another.

32:57.676 --> 33:00.512
For you will be sharing a
page in the history books

33:00.546 --> 33:02.281
as the assembly

33:02.314 --> 33:04.516
that saved the world.

33:04.550 --> 33:06.085
- (applause)
- Thank you.

33:06.118 --> 33:08.354
(applause grows louder)

33:12.258 --> 33:16.528
If the gas targets the
mutation, you would be killed.

33:16.562 --> 33:19.165
I won't be alone.

33:19.198 --> 33:21.433
The 2.2 million people,
they're like you.

33:21.467 --> 33:22.668
Like Kovacs.

33:22.701 --> 33:24.136
How is that even possible?

33:27.839 --> 33:29.375
(man groans, crowd gasps)

33:29.408 --> 33:32.320
Guys, we have a problem. WOMAN: He's
having a heart attack! We need a doctor!

33:32.344 --> 33:34.756
MAN: Somebody get a doctor. JACKSON: You were
supposed to give him a case of the runs,

33:34.780 --> 33:36.648
not a heart attack.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.584
MITCH: A mild heart
attack, he'll be fine.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.419
"Slipping him a mickey."

33:40.452 --> 33:42.188
You said you'd done this before.

33:42.221 --> 33:43.555
I have.

33:43.589 --> 33:45.557
I mean, it was on a
llama, but...

33:45.591 --> 33:46.592
A llama?

33:46.625 --> 33:50.662
I do not want to hear
the rest of that story.

33:50.696 --> 33:51.797
We need a new plan.

33:51.830 --> 33:54.433
We cannot leave
without that sloth.

33:54.466 --> 33:56.235
Give me the mic and
meet me downstairs.

33:57.869 --> 33:58.837
What are you going to do?

33:58.870 --> 34:01.540
Get you the heart-print.

34:03.442 --> 34:05.811
General Davies,
can I steal you for a second?

34:05.844 --> 34:07.413
Of course, Miss, uh...

34:07.446 --> 34:08.414
Diaz.

34:08.447 --> 34:10.081
From Senator Rowan's office. Ah.

34:10.116 --> 34:11.516
What can I do for
you, Miss Diaz?

34:11.550 --> 34:12.694
The senator wanted
to let you know

34:12.717 --> 34:13.728
that you have her full support.

34:13.752 --> 34:15.721
She wanted to talk
to you herself,

34:15.754 --> 34:17.489
but she can't because
she's still working

34:17.523 --> 34:18.489
on some of her collegues,

34:18.524 --> 34:19.591
winning them over.

34:19.625 --> 34:20.826
(groans) She almost had it.

34:20.859 --> 34:23.562
Whatever you need from
her, consider it done.

34:23.594 --> 34:25.507
Please thank the senator,
that's very kind of her.

34:25.531 --> 34:27.833
But I just have one question, Ms.
Diaz.

34:27.866 --> 34:30.202
Where are your friends?

34:30.235 --> 34:32.603
I saw you on the
security footage

34:32.638 --> 34:34.373
from that Accelerator fiasco.

34:34.406 --> 34:37.176
That was a close call you
had, wasn't it,

34:37.208 --> 34:38.377
Lieutenant Marzan?

34:40.478 --> 34:43.149
You're coming with me.

34:43.181 --> 34:44.382
MAN: Good job, General.

34:47.518 --> 34:49.588
Actually, General,
you're coming with me.

34:52.690 --> 34:53.792
What are you doing?

34:53.824 --> 34:55.527
Noting all the exits.

34:55.561 --> 34:57.163
Thanks to Mickey here,

34:57.196 --> 35:00.132
we're preparing to
make a quick departure.

35:00.166 --> 35:02.668
What I said was,
"It should work."

35:02.701 --> 35:04.670
That's not how I remember it.

35:04.703 --> 35:05.671
DAVIES: Oh, look,

35:05.704 --> 35:07.473
the gang's all here.

35:07.506 --> 35:09.541
Do you have any idea
how many soldiers I have

35:09.575 --> 35:10.709
in this building?

35:10.742 --> 35:12.344
My guess is about 30.

35:12.378 --> 35:15.481
And every one of them is focused
on the room with 200 VIPs.

35:17.216 --> 35:19.351
(beeping, heart beating)

35:24.323 --> 35:25.457
Where's the sloth?

35:26.458 --> 35:27.659
(scoffs)

35:27.693 --> 35:29.861
You took a four-star
general hostage

35:29.895 --> 35:31.363
for a sloth?

35:31.397 --> 35:32.498
Well, this is a first,

35:32.531 --> 35:34.233
and it's gonna
land you in deep...

35:34.266 --> 35:36.668
Where's the sloth?

35:36.702 --> 35:38.304
Down there to the
left, tough guy.

35:38.337 --> 35:39.905
Mitch, come with me.

35:39.938 --> 35:41.139
Abe, stay on Davies.

35:42.308 --> 35:43.308
Face the wall.

35:44.643 --> 35:45.911
Come with me.

35:45.944 --> 35:46.912
Where we going?

35:46.945 --> 35:49.548
He gave up the
sloth too quickly.

35:49.581 --> 35:51.717
He was fine with
them going left.

35:51.750 --> 35:55.654
So there must be something this
way he didn't want us to find.

35:55.687 --> 35:58.790
(barking, screeching)

35:58.824 --> 36:02.661
JACKSON: These have to be the
animals for the demonstration.

36:02.694 --> 36:04.630
Let's find this sloth, huh?

36:04.663 --> 36:06.432
(screeching, growling)

36:10.736 --> 36:11.537
Air lock doors.

36:11.570 --> 36:14.306
Looks like your
theory was right.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.575
The gas must be down here.
(phone chiming)

36:16.608 --> 36:17.576
Jaime.

36:17.609 --> 36:18.677
She's in Caraquet.

36:18.710 --> 36:19.711
DARIELA: Keep up!

36:28.887 --> 36:29.888
Bingo.

36:31.457 --> 36:33.759
The gas.

36:33.792 --> 36:35.294
The valves are closed.
That's good.

36:35.327 --> 36:36.828
And this one's the neutralizer.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.297
So that's the poison.

36:38.330 --> 36:40.566
There will be nothing to vote on

36:40.599 --> 36:42.200
if they can't do
the demonstration.

36:43.034 --> 36:44.270
(air hisses)

36:44.303 --> 36:44.870
(grunts)

36:44.903 --> 36:46.638
(groans, chokes)

36:46.672 --> 36:47.973
(both grunting)

36:48.006 --> 36:49.841
(alarm blaring)

36:49.875 --> 36:51.377
(grunts)

36:51.410 --> 36:53.279
That's not good.

36:53.312 --> 36:54.780
(canister rattling)

36:54.813 --> 36:56.882
CHLOE: Go, go, go!

37:05.457 --> 37:07.459
CHLOE: Jaime?

37:07.493 --> 37:08.460
Get up.

37:08.494 --> 37:10.396
Chloe?

37:10.429 --> 37:13.265
Oh, you found me.

37:13.299 --> 37:14.900
You're not gonna die today.

37:14.933 --> 37:17.803
You need to get up.

37:20.439 --> 37:23.342
No, I can't.

37:23.375 --> 37:24.476
Yes, you can.

37:27.846 --> 37:28.847
(sighs)

37:32.851 --> 37:35.387
You have to get up.

37:35.421 --> 37:36.855
Come on.

37:36.888 --> 37:40.326
You can do it.

37:40.359 --> 37:41.460
(grunts softly)

37:41.493 --> 37:43.762
That's it.

37:43.795 --> 37:45.464
Keep moving.

37:45.497 --> 37:47.499
(grunts)

38:02.581 --> 38:03.582
Chloe...

38:33.612 --> 38:35.614
♪

38:43.121 --> 38:45.524
LOGAN: Jaime!

38:45.557 --> 38:47.559
Logan, I'm here.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.796
(alarm blaring,
birds screeching)

38:50.829 --> 38:52.063
Hey.

38:52.097 --> 38:53.098
I got it.

38:54.766 --> 38:55.767
Hey, buddy.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.371
Hope this thing is soundproof.

38:59.405 --> 39:00.572
Yeah, let's not find out.

39:01.640 --> 39:02.641
Hey, what's going on?

39:02.674 --> 39:03.642
Davies set off the alarm.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.577
I disabled the doors,
but there'll be others.

39:05.611 --> 39:07.579
We have to go. (grunting)

39:07.613 --> 39:09.715
ABRAHAM: Okay, lift. This.

39:33.939 --> 39:35.073
Target! Take cover!

39:39.511 --> 39:40.512
I got this.

39:55.126 --> 39:56.528
(both groan)

39:56.562 --> 39:57.629
It's clear!

39:57.663 --> 39:58.697
Let's go. (air hissing)

39:58.730 --> 40:01.633
It's been hit. Run.

40:01.667 --> 40:02.801
This could kill everybody.

40:05.637 --> 40:07.639
(panting)

40:07.673 --> 40:09.475
(rumbling)

40:09.508 --> 40:10.642
Chloe!

40:12.878 --> 40:13.879
Chloe!

40:15.514 --> 40:17.516
Chloe!

40:23.889 --> 40:25.624
(grunts) Chloe!

40:28.594 --> 40:31.229
No.

40:31.262 --> 40:33.131
Chloe!

40:33.164 --> 40:34.666
CHLOE: No.

40:34.700 --> 40:35.667
Jamie,

40:35.701 --> 40:36.968
she's in Caraquet.

40:37.002 --> 40:38.970
I don't understand you.

40:39.004 --> 40:39.971
Jaime...

40:40.005 --> 40:42.674
(weakly): she's in Caraquet.

40:42.708 --> 40:44.710
I don't understand.
She's in Caraquet.

40:44.743 --> 40:46.120
She's in Caraquet.
I don't understand.

40:46.144 --> 40:48.213
She's in Ca... I'm sorry.

40:48.246 --> 40:50.782
I don't understand! Jaime.

40:54.119 --> 40:55.687
I don't understand.

40:55.721 --> 40:58.223
I'm sorry, Chloe!

40:58.256 --> 41:00.258
Chloe!

41:00.291 --> 41:02.027
(muffled): Damn it!

41:02.060 --> 41:03.061
Chloe!

41:05.196 --> 41:07.733
Chloe! (pounding on glass)

41:07.766 --> 41:09.668
Chloe!

41:18.710 --> 41:19.911
Oh, come on.

41:19.945 --> 41:20.946
Come on!

41:24.249 --> 41:25.250
No!
