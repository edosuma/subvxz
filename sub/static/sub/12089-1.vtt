00:43.480 --> 00:44.970
<i>That's me, Walter.</i>

00:45.120 --> 00:46.849
Where... Where'd you go?
Oh, there you are!

00:47.000 --> 00:49.765
<i>I have the best life
in the whole world.</i>

00:51.800 --> 00:53.882
<i>That's my brother, Gary.</i>

00:54.040 --> 00:56.520
<i>He's the best friend
you could ever have.</i>

00:57.600 --> 01:00.524
<i>Yeah, I know what
you're thinking.</i>

01:00.680 --> 01:02.284
<i>We could be twins.</i>

01:02.840 --> 01:05.126
<i>Smalltown...</i>

01:08.920 --> 01:11.287
<i>...the best town you
could ever grow up in.</i>

01:15.120 --> 01:17.885
<i>Gary and I did
everything together.</i>

01:28.920 --> 01:32.049
<i>And, as the years passed, my
brother was always there for me.</i>

01:32.200 --> 01:35.602
I got it! Gary, throw me!
Throw me!

01:35.760 --> 01:37.125
Aaah!

01:38.240 --> 01:39.810
<i>We were a great team.</i>

01:40.960 --> 01:43.645
- Nice job, Walter.
- Thanks, Gary.

01:48.960 --> 01:51.486
<i>Oh, don't get me wrong.
It's not perfect.</i>

01:51.640 --> 01:54.530
<i>- That was so fun!
- Nothing is.</i>

01:54.680 --> 01:55.761
Sorry, kid.

01:55.920 --> 01:58.241
- I wanna do that again!
- Come on. I'll ride with ya!

01:58.400 --> 01:59.640
Hurry up!

01:59.800 --> 02:03.646
<i>Even the sunniest days can
have a few clouds in them.</i>

02:08.240 --> 02:11.608
Ride's bogus, anyway.
Hey, wanna rent a video?

02:11.760 --> 02:14.366
Yeah. Race you home!

02:14.520 --> 02:18.605
<i>And, well, that night sorta
changed everything.</i>

02:19.480 --> 02:23.724
<i>It's The Muppet Show, with our very
special guest star, Mr. Steve Martin!</i>

02:24.920 --> 02:26.809
<i>I found them...</i>

02:28.400 --> 02:29.640
<i>The Muppets.</i>

02:34.680 --> 02:37.684
<i>I guess you could say I was
their number one fan.</i>

02:37.880 --> 02:42.329
Oh, Gary, it's an entire
map of The Muppet Studios.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.089
<i>And they made all
the difference.</i>

02:48.240 --> 02:50.641
<i>- Trick or treat!
- Because from then on...</i>

02:50.800 --> 02:52.245
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, Gary.

02:52.440 --> 02:56.126
- Hey.
- Hi-ho, guys. Yay!

02:58.760 --> 03:02.526
Is that Kermit the Frog?
What is this, 1978?

03:02.680 --> 03:05.126
<i>...even on the worst
days, I knew...</i>

03:06.480 --> 03:08.767
<i>...that as the years passed...</i>

03:08.920 --> 03:10.570
<i>Cancel that last remark.</i>

03:10.720 --> 03:13.769
<i>...as long as there are singing
frogs and joking bears...</i>

03:16.080 --> 03:18.481
<i>...Swedish chefs and
boomerang fish,</i>

03:18.640 --> 03:22.326
<i>the world can't be such
a bad place after all.</i>

03:25.040 --> 03:26.371
All right, good night, buddy.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.562
Oh, good night, Gary.

03:28.720 --> 03:31.041
<i>And as long as there
are Muppets...</i>

03:34.040 --> 03:36.407
<i>- ...for me...
- ...hair-growing tonic.</i>

03:36.560 --> 03:38.449
<i>...there's still...</i>

03:38.600 --> 03:41.046
<i>- ...hope.</i>

03:44.680 --> 03:47.081
Aaah. Bye-bye!

03:47.240 --> 03:50.164
<i>Somebody get him!</i>

03:51.080 --> 03:53.560
Animal. Hey, Animal, come on.
The show's about to start.

03:53.720 --> 03:55.802
Show! Show!

03:56.520 --> 03:58.409
<i>Hey, Walter, why
don't you join us?</i>

03:58.560 --> 04:00.130
<i>Come on!</i>

04:04.600 --> 04:08.685
No! Wait! I want to be with you guys!
Please let me in!

04:08.840 --> 04:11.411
Kermit!

04:14.440 --> 04:15.965
Whoa!

04:16.120 --> 04:17.360
Walter, are you OK, buddy?

04:17.519 --> 04:20.171
You're drenched in sweat.
Did you have the dream again?

04:20.360 --> 04:25.082
Ummm. No. Hey, so when are
you guys leaving today?

04:25.280 --> 04:27.408
Oh, um, just a couple hours now.

04:27.560 --> 04:32.122
Oh, wow, Gary, I think it is so cool
you're taking Mary to Los Angeles.

04:32.280 --> 04:35.682
I can't believe you guys have
been dating for ten years.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.286
I know. Yeah, she wanted to do something
special for this anniversary,

04:38.440 --> 04:40.920
and she's always wanted
to see Los Angeles, so...

04:41.080 --> 04:43.651
Hey, don't forget to send me a
postcard from The Muppet Studios.

04:43.840 --> 04:46.684
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

04:46.840 --> 04:50.606
- I can't do that, Walter.
- But, Gary...

04:50.760 --> 04:52.842
Because...
you're coming with us!

04:53.000 --> 04:56.243
Qh, Gary!

04:56.440 --> 04:58.363
- But what about Mary?
- She's fine.

04:58.520 --> 05:02.684
- She said the more the merrier.
- <i>I...</i> I don't know what to say!

05:02.840 --> 05:06.003
The Muppet Studios are there, Gary.
I can't believe this!

05:06.200 --> 05:08.646
Better get a move on.
We don't want to miss that bus!

05:08.800 --> 05:12.600
No way! Who knows?
Maybe Kermit will be there.

05:12.760 --> 05:14.524
I wouldn't get your
hopes up, buddy.

05:14.680 --> 05:17.081
The Muppets haven't put on
a show together in years.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.846
I don't think they use the studios
for anything but tours any more.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.446
Nah, I think that's
just an Internet rumor.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.250
Like there's a country
called Turkey.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.925
Walter, how many times do
we have to go over this?

05:26.080 --> 05:28.082
- Turkey is a very real country.
- Wow, Muppet Studios.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.163
- I can't believe it!

All right, Carlos.
Flip the ignition.

08:15.760 --> 08:17.967
And that is how you fix
a 12-volt starter.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.406
- Oh!

08:19.600 --> 08:22.001
You know what that means.
Spring break.

08:23.320 --> 08:25.448
It's OK. We'll be back to
studying in two weeks.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.444
Yay!

08:28.600 --> 08:30.841
- Have a nice vacation.
- Bye. Have fun.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.604
- Bye, Mr. Gary.

08:32.760 --> 08:33.841

- Thanks.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.410
Enjoy your anniversary dinner.

08:35.559 --> 08:37.688
- Hi.
- I got you these.

08:38.919 --> 08:42.322
Oh. Sorry. It's probably from
the dance number I was doing.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.482
It's OK. They're really sweet.

08:44.640 --> 08:47.246
You excited for our big trip to LA?
I have our list.

08:47.400 --> 08:50.244

08:54.760 --> 08:56.171
I know.
Walter can't wait either.

08:56.320 --> 08:58.209
You don't mind that
he's coming, right?

08:59.280 --> 09:01.328
No. No, of course not.

09:01.480 --> 09:04.689
As long <i>as</i> we can spend our anniversary
dinner together. That's all I ask.

09:04.840 --> 09:09.482
Totally. It's gonna be the most

09:11.760 --> 09:12.886
Oh.

09:13.680 --> 09:16.081

10:52.520 --> 10:55.171
OK, they're gone!

11:00.920 --> 11:03.287
Hey, Gary, what should we
do first at Muppet Studio?

11:03.440 --> 11:06.410
Cause I was thinking that maybe we
could start at Fozzie's Joke Room...

11:06.600 --> 11:07.647
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.087
The lines might be shorter at
Honeydew's Laboratory of Fun

11:10.240 --> 11:14.086
so maybe we should start there instead I just...
I just can't wait!

11:35.240 --> 11:37.322
Oh, Walter, don't be nervous.

11:37.480 --> 11:40.927
Oh, I know.
I just can't believe I'm here.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.003
The home of the Muppets!

11:47.760 --> 11:51.207
What...
What happened to this place?

12:00.120 --> 12:00.962
Where...?

12:01.120 --> 12:05.091
- Where is everyone, Gary?
- I don't know, buddy. It's so...

12:08.320 --> 12:11.085
OK, well, I guess you
guys are it for today.

12:12.240 --> 12:16.006
Anyway, welcome to the
original Muppet Studio,

12:16.160 --> 12:18.811
where dreams can come true.

12:21.280 --> 12:24.727
- Is this the Universal Studios?
- Yes, it is.

12:24.880 --> 12:28.168
OK, now if you'll just
follow me, please.

12:29.840 --> 12:32.969
OK. This used to be
Kermit's office.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.963
- Whoa.
- Mm-hmm.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.849
It's really the
highlight of the tour.

12:38.040 --> 12:39.690
You should see it sometime.

12:39.840 --> 12:43.242
OK, this next building is
where they kept the rope

12:43.400 --> 12:48.327
and the medium-gauge wire for the productions.
Let's go take a look.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.171
- Come on, buddy.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.483
Wow!

13:15.880 --> 13:18.884
Oh, boy.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.762
Oh.

13:32.960 --> 13:34.564
Whoa.

13:42.360 --> 13:47.002
There. Now this here is
Kermit the Frog's old office.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.288
- Or so we've been "toad."

13:49.440 --> 13:54.970
Well, as you know, gentlemen, I've
loved the Muppets since I was a boy.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.888
And what better way
to honor the Muppets

13:58.040 --> 14:02.045
than to make this beautiful
studio a Muppet museum.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.529
I think I'll call this room

14:05.680 --> 14:08.843
the "Kermit the Frog's
Old Office Room."

14:09.000 --> 14:10.809
- Oh, that is lovely.
- Oh, good one, Mr. Richman.

14:10.960 --> 14:14.885
Now, this here is the standard
"Rich and Famous" contract

14:15.080 --> 14:17.651
Kermit signed 30 years
ago, that contains...

14:17.800 --> 14:20.929
- The deed to this property.
- Exactly.

14:21.080 --> 14:26.530
Now, this contract is 100 percent
ironclad, with one minor exception.

14:26.680 --> 14:29.490
If the Muppets can raise the ten
million dollars it would cost

14:29.680 --> 14:32.047
to buy the building before
this contract expires,

14:32.200 --> 14:35.329
- then they get their studio back.
- You know, if I didn't know better,

14:35.520 --> 14:38.330
I'd say you were reciting some
sort of an important plot point.

14:38.520 --> 14:41.444
Well, I hope so. Otherwise, I just
bored the audience half to death.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.602
You mean half the
audience is still alive?

14:45.440 --> 14:46.726
It's nice doing
business with you.

14:46.880 --> 14:49.884
- Yes, sir. Come on.
- Goodbye.

14:50.040 --> 14:52.008
I love geriatric humor.

14:52.200 --> 14:56.603
Gentlemen, there's oil
under this studio.

14:58.360 --> 14:59.885
- Yeah, I can smell it.

15:00.080 --> 15:03.687
And more importantly, the geological
survey says there definitely is.

15:03.880 --> 15:07.168
In two weeks, we tear
this place to the ground

15:07.320 --> 15:10.563
and start drilling.
Ah, those Muppets

15:10.760 --> 15:14.446
They think they're so funny.

15:14.640 --> 15:18.645
Well, it looks like the
joke's about to be on them.

15:18.800 --> 15:21.326
- Maniacal laugh.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.170
Maniacal laugh.

15:24.240 --> 15:27.323
Maniacal laugh. Maniacal laugh.

15:28.760 --> 15:30.967
- Maniacal laugh.

15:35.440 --> 15:37.204
- Walter!
- Walter?

15:37.360 --> 15:38.600
- Walter!
- Walter!

15:53.920 --> 15:56.685
Yeah, so then, when he thought
they were alone, he said,

15:56.840 --> 15:59.127
"There's oil under
this studio, see.

15:59.280 --> 16:01.567
I'm gonna tear it
to the ground, see.

16:01.720 --> 16:05.008
- Sweet, sweet oil, see!"
- People still talk like that?

16:05.160 --> 16:06.889
Maybe that's just how
he sounded in my head.

16:07.040 --> 16:10.601
Either way, we've got to find Kermit!
He'll know what to do.

16:10.760 --> 16:13.001
How do we find Kermit?
Nobody's seen him in years.

16:13.200 --> 16:17.000
Stop the car! I've got an idea!

16:17.200 --> 16:20.170
Mmm.

16:20.320 --> 16:21.765
These are delicious!

16:21.920 --> 16:23.729
- Great idea, Walter.
- Mm-hmm.

16:31.680 --> 16:33.284
We've been doing this
for a long time.

16:33.440 --> 16:34.771
I think maybe we should
call it a night.

16:34.920 --> 16:37.207
Guys! - We can't give up, Gary.

16:37.360 --> 16:40.170
But it's getting really late.
Maybe we should just go back to the motel.

16:40.320 --> 16:42.129
- Guys!
- It...

16:42.280 --> 16:43.486
- What?
- What?

16:43.640 --> 16:48.362
- Maybe he lives there.
- Oh. That's it.

16:50.120 --> 16:51.360
So, what do we do now?

16:55.720 --> 16:59.611
I don't see a doorbell, and
the house looks empty.

16:59.760 --> 17:01.524
- Gary, throw me over.
- What?

17:01.680 --> 17:05.002
- Gary, just throw me over already!
- OK.

17:05.160 --> 17:08.686
- OK, here we go. <i>OK...</i>
- One, two, three.

17:10.040 --> 17:11.451
- That's good.
- Sorry.

17:11.599 --> 17:12.931
- No, it's good.
- Guys?

17:13.079 --> 17:15.127
I think that's an
electric fence.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.611
Mary, it's Kermit the Frog.

17:16.800 --> 17:20.486
- OK, buddy, head down.
- One, two, three!

17:27.599 --> 17:29.728
- It's an electric fence.
- Yep.

17:30.800 --> 17:35.681
Oh, my gosh. Walter? Walter, buddy?
Walter, can you hear me?

17:35.840 --> 17:38.446
Throw me again. - No, I don't...

17:38.600 --> 17:40.568
I don't think
that's a good idea.

17:40.720 --> 17:43.166
- What kind of throw was that?
- I think there's somebody coming.

17:43.320 --> 17:44.765
Excuse me...

17:52.320 --> 17:55.164
You OK? That was quite a tumble.

17:57.680 --> 18:00.160
Oh. Look, look. I think...

18:00.320 --> 18:02.288
Hey. Hey, Walter?

18:02.440 --> 18:05.444
- Walter, you all right, buddy?
- Where am I?

18:05.640 --> 18:10.282
OK, this is awesome.
We're at Kermit's house.

18:10.480 --> 18:13.723
- Oh, jeez. Walter.
- No, no, no, no, no. You OK?

18:14.320 --> 18:18.370
This... This is Kermit's house?

18:19.200 --> 18:21.009
- Anyhow, how can
I help you guys?

18:21.200 --> 18:23.931
Let me just say, this is an honor
for all of us to meet you, sir,

18:24.120 --> 18:26.248
but my brother, Walter, has some
really disturbing news for you.

18:26.400 --> 18:30.166
- Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
- Not now, 80's Robot.

18:30.320 --> 18:32.846
Might I offer you a drink? Tab?

18:33.000 --> 18:34.240
Good grief. - New Coke?

18:34.400 --> 18:36.687
Listen. Not right now,
80's Robot, please!

18:36.880 --> 18:38.450
Bummer.

18:38.600 --> 18:39.931
Watch out for the...
- Gag me with a spoon.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.969
Yeah, head for the door.
- Grody to the max.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.771
- Ow.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.565
Ow.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.643
- I'm really sorry about that...

18:49.640 --> 18:51.961
...Walter. What were you saying?

18:52.120 --> 18:55.681
- Yes. Tex Richman, the oil baron, <i>is...</i>
- Yes, yes, yes.

18:55.840 --> 18:57.763
Oil baron Tex Richman, the
wealthy philanthropist.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.241
You know, he's about to buy
our old Muppet Show theater

19:00.400 --> 19:02.368
and turn it into a Muppet museum.
Isn't that great?

19:02.520 --> 19:05.729
- No! I mean...
- What Walter's trying to tell you

19:05.880 --> 19:09.646
is that Tex Richman has a secret plan to
tear down the theater and drill for oil.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.768
- What?
- The only way to save the studio

19:11.960 --> 19:14.201
is to raise ten million dollars.

19:14.360 --> 19:17.409
Ten million dollars?
That's impossible.

19:17.560 --> 19:18.846
- But...
- The only way to raise

19:19.000 --> 19:20.365
that kind of money
would be to...

19:22.120 --> 19:25.203
...would be to put on a show.

19:25.360 --> 19:30.526
And I haven't seen the old
gang in a long, long time.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.367
I guess people soft
of forgot about us.

Mmm...

22:15.960 --> 22:18.531
This is going to be a
really short movie

22:18.680 --> 22:22.685
But, Kermit, you have to try.

22:22.840 --> 22:26.128
<i>I...</i> The Muppets are amazing.

22:26.320 --> 22:29.847
You give people the greatest
gift that can ever be given.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.571

22:35.560 --> 22:37.403

- Yes!

22:37.560 --> 22:40.211
The third greatest gift ever!

Kermit, your fans never left you,
the world hasn't forgotten.

22:43.960 --> 22:46.361
All you need to do
is show 'em again!

22:46.520 --> 22:47.931
Hmm.

22:49.880 --> 22:52.850
I don't think so, guys.

22:54.320 --> 22:56.607
Don't you see, Kermit?

You're my hero.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.803
You're on my watch.

23:24.960 --> 23:29.204
Well, I... I guess...

23:30.880 --> 23:32.166
<i>...we</i> could try.

23:32.320 --> 23:34.243
- We?
- Well, yeah, listen.

23:34.400 --> 23:36.607
If I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna
need some moral support.

23:36.760 --> 23:40.685
Well, that's perfect.
We're experts at moral support.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.729
- Yeah!
- Good. I guess if we're gonna go,

23:42.880 --> 23:44.803
we better get going.
We got a lot of people to find.

23:44.960 --> 23:48.009
Oh, great!
But wait, how do we find 'em?

23:48.160 --> 23:50.322
Didn't you see our first movie?

23:51.040 --> 23:52.804
We drive.

24:06.280 --> 24:09.568
- So where do we go first?
- I shall take the liberty

24:09.760 --> 24:12.047
of using my modem to
locate the Muppets.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.725
- OK.
- Great

24:14.280 --> 24:16.282
- Oh, stop it!

24:16.440 --> 24:19.011

sacred, let it end!

You have reached your destination.
My guidance ends here.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.480

We'll be back in six minutes.

25:23.760 --> 25:24.761
- Hmm.

25:28.600 --> 25:31.171
- Hi-ho, Fozzie.
- Hi-ho, Kermit.

25:31.320 --> 25:34.130
Kermit? What are you doing here?

25:34.280 --> 25:37.568
Well, <i>I...</i> I just want to
tell you that was a great show.

25:37.760 --> 25:40.809
It was... very informative.

25:40.960 --> 25:42.644
I do my best to keep
it fresh each night.

25:42.800 --> 25:44.564
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, I'm Fozzie, by the way.

25:44.720 --> 25:47.564
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is Gary and Mary.

25:47.720 --> 25:50.849
And this here is Walter.
He's a personal friend.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.844
- Yeah.
- So I said, "What are you looking at?"

25:54.000 --> 25:57.322
So I punched him in the face!
I mean...

25:57.480 --> 26:00.245
- Let's talk in my dressing room.
- Sure.

26:00.400 --> 26:03.563
- OK.
- Here we are.

26:04.840 --> 26:06.046
Make yourselves at home.

26:07.480 --> 26:08.641
- Wow.

26:09.280 --> 26:11.726
This is not quite
what I expected,

26:11.920 --> 26:15.527
- based on your Christmas cards.
- Oh, yeah. About that...

26:15.680 --> 26:18.684
Oh, but it's nice, and...
and airy.

26:18.840 --> 26:20.808
Maybe we should give
them some space.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.849
I know, but I wanna hear
what they're gonna say. OK.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.162
Sixty-four shows nightly
can get pretty grueling.

26:25.320 --> 26:28.881
Fozzie, an evil oil baron wants to
tear down our old Muppet studio.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.486
- What? Oh, no!

26:31.640 --> 26:34.530
- I mean, that's a shame.

26:34.680 --> 26:37.365
Step out of the vehicle!

26:37.520 --> 26:39.329
Hey, Fozzie...

26:40.320 --> 26:42.766
I'm sorry I haven't
been in touch more.

26:42.920 --> 26:47.084
It's fine, Kermit. Look at me!
Living the dream!

26:47.240 --> 26:48.366
- Uh-oh.

26:48.520 --> 26:51.251
Oh, no! Not this again!

26:51.400 --> 26:54.051
- Quick, save the cushions!
- The cushions?

26:58.320 --> 26:59.890
I'm sorry, Fozzie.

27:00.040 --> 27:02.168
If I'd known you were
here in this place...

27:02.320 --> 27:05.369
That's all right, Kermit.
It's not your fault.

27:05.560 --> 27:09.042
- We had a good run.
- Yeah.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.248
Yeah, it's just that...

27:11.440 --> 27:16.287
Well, we haven't seen each other
in a really long time, and I...

27:16.440 --> 27:19.125
I just thought maybe we could raise
the money to buy the theater back

27:19.320 --> 27:22.529
if we all got together and
put on one last show.

27:22.680 --> 27:26.401
A show? But I've spent years
building a solo career.

27:26.560 --> 27:29.803
I have a whole new show-biz
family that loves me.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.721
Fozzie! What the heck are
you doing, hibernating?

27:33.920 --> 27:36.082
Next show starts in 30 seconds.

27:36.240 --> 27:42.122
We hired you, and we can fire you,
so get your butt in here now!

27:44.040 --> 27:46.691
- They terrify me. Let's go.
- Let's go.

27:49.040 --> 27:51.850
- Watch out for the forklift, Fozzie.
- Oh, thanks.

27:53.080 --> 27:55.367
Wow! Gonzo's doing really well!

27:55.520 --> 27:56.601
According to 80's Robot,

27:56.760 --> 27:59.206
he's the richest plumbing
magnate in the Rust Belt.

27:59.400 --> 28:03.371
You! Order 28,000 tons of
plumber's putty from Beijing.

28:03.520 --> 28:06.444
Right away, sir.
- And, you, send the 28,000 tons

28:06.600 --> 28:08.250
of Silly Putty back to Beijing.

28:08.400 --> 28:09.925
You bet. - Oh, and you?

28:10.120 --> 28:12.441
A memo to the waterless
toilet department.

28:12.600 --> 28:15.206
I don't care about the
mess, just keep trying.

28:15.360 --> 28:19.649
- Hi, Gonzo.
- Kermit? Fozzie? This is a surprise.

28:19.840 --> 28:23.049
- We need to speak to you.
- All right. Have a seat.

28:24.240 --> 28:26.163
Ah. Thank you!

28:26.320 --> 28:30.769
- I think I'll stand.
- No, really, you should try one! Comfy.

28:30.920 --> 28:32.365
It's our executive
line of used toilets.

28:33.440 --> 28:36.523
Anyway, I'm very busy.
I've got 30 seconds. Go.

28:37.280 --> 28:40.170
Uh... Gonzo, I'm not quite
sure how to say this, but...

28:40.360 --> 28:41.964
Don't forget to mention
the evil oil baron.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.521
Yes, Fozzie, I was about to.
Just give me a moment, OK?

28:44.680 --> 28:46.682
Gonzo, it would appear...

28:46.840 --> 28:48.365
Remember, evil oil baron.

28:48.520 --> 28:51.046
Fozzie, I'm going to get to that.
Please!

28:51.200 --> 28:53.248
- As I was trying to say...
- Evil oil baron.

28:53.400 --> 28:56.529
- OK, time's up.
Thank you, guys.

28:56.680 --> 29:01.481
Gonzo, we're trying to get the
old gang back together again.

29:01.640 --> 29:05.440
- We really need you.
- My answer is no. Good day!

29:07.480 --> 29:09.687
Come on, guys. We should go.

29:13.480 --> 29:17.804
I just want to say, when I was
a kid, I saw you recite Hamlet

29:17.960 --> 29:20.645
while jumping your motorbike
through a flaming hoop, and...

29:20.800 --> 29:24.247
...it made me feel like
I could do anything.

29:24.400 --> 29:27.404
Thank you. Yeah.

29:38.800 --> 29:42.521
- Good try, Walter.
- Hey, guys, up here!

29:42.680 --> 29:44.569
- Ya-haa!
- Huh?

29:44.760 --> 29:48.526
I've been wearing this under my
suit every single day for years!

29:48.720 --> 29:50.085
Look out below!

29:52.040 --> 29:54.805
Whoa, where you going?
You threw me off-balance!

29:54.960 --> 29:58.328
I can't see! Apollo 13!

30:01.960 --> 30:05.169
Citizens of Earth, the
Great Gonzo is back.

30:05.360 --> 30:08.728
I pledge never to
hold a plunger again!

30:11.240 --> 30:15.723
Run! Run! Run for your lives!
Run, run, run!

30:15.880 --> 30:20.010
- Run, guys!
- Run!

30:20.160 --> 30:21.491
Oh, my gosh, run everybody!

30:21.640 --> 30:24.530
It's gonna be big!
It's gonna be a big one!

30:34.720 --> 30:37.929
Wow! That was an expensive
looking explosion!

30:38.080 --> 30:40.526
I can't believe we had
that in the budget.

30:42.720 --> 30:45.451
So maybe if you look
inside yourself,

30:45.600 --> 30:49.650
the person you should be
most angry at is you.

30:49.800 --> 30:50.847
Is you.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.686
How have you been feeling?
Any more control issues?

30:55.840 --> 30:58.446
In control.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.602
- Good. Psst. Animal!

31:00.760 --> 31:03.923
Excellent. - It's me, Kermit.

31:04.080 --> 31:08.290
Hey, we're having a meeting here, man.
You're being really rude, frog!

31:08.440 --> 31:11.489
Pardon us, please.
Animal, I need to talk to you for a second.

31:11.680 --> 31:15.605
We're getting the Muppets back together.
We need you to drum again.

31:15.760 --> 31:17.330
- Animal drum?
- Yes!

31:17.520 --> 31:19.488
- Please, sir.
- Drum! Drum, drum!

31:19.640 --> 31:21.802
- Drum, drum, drum!
- OK, OK.

31:22.480 --> 31:25.051
- In control.
- Good.

31:25.200 --> 31:27.487
I'm Animal's
court-appointed sponsor

31:27.640 --> 31:30.803
We don't use the "d-r-u-m" word.

31:30.960 --> 31:33.008
- It's his trigger word.
- His trigger word?

31:33.200 --> 31:35.521
Excuse me, Mr. Black.
I'm so sorry to interrupt,

31:35.680 --> 31:37.762
but it's very important to these
guys that they get their drummer...

31:38.560 --> 31:39.721
Gary!

31:39.880 --> 31:41.530
It's my trigger word, too.

31:41.680 --> 31:45.446
Jack, we talked about
this on Tuesday.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.841
Tuesday's another one
of my trigger words!

31:48.560 --> 31:50.085
Oh, I don't think so!

31:51.880 --> 31:53.166
Sorry.

31:53.320 --> 31:55.084
- Let's go, Animal.
- Bye-bye!

31:55.240 --> 31:58.323
- Animal, heel.
- Go, Animal! Be free, man!

31:58.520 --> 32:02.161
But remember! No drumming!

32:02.320 --> 32:06.086
Mr. Kermit, may I suggest
we save time and pick up

32:06.240 --> 32:08.402
the rest of the Muppets
using a montage?

32:08.560 --> 32:10.688
Great idea, 80's Robot.

32:12.480 --> 32:15.404
We greatly appreciate
your financial support.

32:15.800 --> 32:18.610
Eighty-seven point three miles to go.
Eighty-seven point two...

32:18.760 --> 32:20.489
80's Robot, do you
have to do that?

32:20.640 --> 32:22.324
...the secrets of
the universe...

32:28.600 --> 32:29.886
I guess we're in.

32:31.280 --> 32:35.683
<i>Welcome to this week's edition
of "Everything Stinks."</i>

32:36.360 --> 32:37.202
Whoa!

32:39.040 --> 32:41.691
Bye, Lisa.
Off to the TED Conference.

32:42.600 --> 32:45.126
Three, two, one.

32:46.960 --> 32:49.725
Think we should've
rented a bigger car?

32:49.880 --> 32:54.408
Hey, wait for me!
I wanna help save the studio!

32:54.560 --> 32:58.884
I wanna go with you!
Oh, not again.

32:59.080 --> 33:02.163
Wow. I can't believe
we're all back together.

33:02.320 --> 33:03.890
Even all you guys who
weren't in the montage!

33:04.080 --> 33:07.243
Yeah, how come you didn't
use me in the montage?

33:07.400 --> 33:09.402
I thought my story was
pretty interesting.

33:09.560 --> 33:13.281
- Rowlf?
Wanna get back together?

33:13.440 --> 33:14.566
- OK.
- Good.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.683
Classic.

33:16.840 --> 33:18.604
Anyhow, looks like
we got everybody,

33:18.760 --> 33:20.922
so we can plan our telethon and
raise that ten million dollars.

33:21.080 --> 33:22.809
- Well, not everybody.
- No, I think everybody's here.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.200
- Where's...?
- All good!

33:24.360 --> 33:25.646
- Miss...
- All done here!

33:25.800 --> 33:27.245
- Piggy?

33:27.440 --> 33:30.125
Kermit, we're going to
get Miss Piggy, right?

33:30.320 --> 33:32.482
OK, OK, OK, you're right.
We'll go get Piggy!

33:33.960 --> 33:37.487
My Minitel tells me she
is in Paris, France.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.324
Oh! Well, then we
drive to France.

33:39.480 --> 33:43.405
- You can't drive to France, Walter.
- Yeah. It's way too far.

33:43.560 --> 33:45.324
Then maybe we should
travel by map!

33:45.480 --> 33:47.721
- Good idea, Fozzie.
- Yeah!

34:09.600 --> 34:10.931
To Paris!

34:11.080 --> 34:13.003
Paris! Paris!

34:28.360 --> 34:29.771
Look at these ceilings!

34:29.960 --> 34:31.485
Yeah.
They must be very tall here.

34:31.639 --> 34:34.371
Yeah, very nice.

34:34.520 --> 34:38.605
Uh... Hi there. Excuse me.

34:40.280 --> 34:43.887
Miss? Pardon me, ma'am?

34:44.040 --> 34:46.771
Hi there! We're here to see
Miss Piggy, and it's urgent.

34:46.920 --> 34:48.842
Urgent! Urgent!

34:49.000 --> 34:50.889
- Is it urgent?
- Very. Yes.

34:51.040 --> 34:55.523
Let's have a look then, shall we?
She has an opening in...

34:57.000 --> 34:59.446
- ...early September.
- Early September?

34:59.600 --> 35:01.170
That's like six months from now!

35:01.320 --> 35:04.244
That's nothing.
Once I waited a whole year for September.

35:04.400 --> 35:08.086
She is the plus-size editor.
She's a huge deal and extremely busy.

35:08.240 --> 35:09.969
You can't just pop in
without an appointment.

35:10.120 --> 35:12.407
- OK, then.
- Thank you.

35:12.560 --> 35:14.210
- All right.
- Mean lady.

35:14.360 --> 35:16.931
- Close the door on your way out.
- Thanks a lot.

35:17.880 --> 35:19.962
- She wasn't very nice.
- Yeah.

35:22.360 --> 35:25.125
Guys! Muppet Man!

35:25.280 --> 35:28.602
- Yeah!
- That could work!

35:33.880 --> 35:35.325
Hello.

35:42.640 --> 35:45.086
I have an appointment.

35:45.840 --> 35:47.888
Oh, OK.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.445
<i>Um...</i>

35:50.600 --> 35:51.965
Will you wait here a moment?

35:52.120 --> 35:54.771
Decisions, decisions.

35:54.960 --> 35:58.931
- Eeny, meeny, miny, mo.
I choose you.

36:00.240 --> 36:02.561
- Mademoiselle Cochonnet?

36:02.760 --> 36:05.491
- Can't you see I'm busy?
- Of course.

36:05.680 --> 36:09.048
There's a...
man here to see you.

36:09.200 --> 36:11.601
He does have an appointment.

36:11.760 --> 36:13.842
An appointment? That's weird.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.729
Well, why didn't you say so?
Send him in!

36:15.880 --> 36:17.041
Right away. Sorry.

36:20.640 --> 36:23.211
- Ahahaha.
- Remember, left foot, right foot.

36:23.360 --> 36:24.361
Hello.

36:24.520 --> 36:26.010
- Whoa.

36:26.200 --> 36:27.964
- What the...?
- Sorry.

36:28.160 --> 36:29.605
That looked expensive.

36:38.320 --> 36:42.564
- You look familiar.
- So do you!

36:43.760 --> 36:45.364
Please, have a seat.

36:45.520 --> 36:48.171
Yes, we're going to
have a seat now.

36:48.320 --> 36:51.085
- No, no, no, don't sit down!
- Oh, sorry! Whoa!

36:51.240 --> 36:52.048
Uh-oh.

36:52.200 --> 36:56.569
Message to head. Left leg in trouble!
Going down. Left leg going down!

36:56.720 --> 36:57.687
What?

36:58.360 --> 37:01.967
- Ohh!

37:02.120 --> 37:04.327
I can't believe I
fell for Muppet Man.

37:04.480 --> 37:06.847
- You guys OK?
- Is anyone hurt?

37:08.680 --> 37:09.727
Kermit?

37:11.920 --> 37:14.571
- Hello, Piggy.
- Kermie!

37:14.720 --> 37:18.611
Oh, Kermie, Kermie, Kermie, Kermie,
Kermie, Kermie, Kermie, Kermie, Kermie!

37:18.760 --> 37:21.081
Mm, mm, mm. Kissy-kissy.
Mm, mm, mm!

37:21.240 --> 37:25.882
Wait! What am I doing?
I promised myself I'd never go back!

37:26.040 --> 37:30.762
I am woman! I am strong!
You must leave at once!

37:32.080 --> 37:34.606
- OK.
- No, no, wait, wait!

37:34.760 --> 37:37.923
Miss Piggy!
The Muppet Studios are in danger.

37:38.080 --> 37:42.005
In danger? Our studios? Kermit!

37:42.160 --> 37:46.643
It's true, Piggy. And we need to
do The <i>Muppet</i> Show again.

37:46.800 --> 37:47.847
We need you.

37:48.800 --> 37:49.847
Oh.

37:50.720 --> 37:56.011
Before I decide anything, I
need to talk with you, frog.

37:59.480 --> 38:01.209
Alone.

38:06.840 --> 38:13.086
Piggy? Last time we were together,
I said some things I regret.

38:13.240 --> 38:16.608
No. No, Kermit.
You were just being honest.

38:16.760 --> 38:18.967
You never intended to marry me.

38:19.120 --> 38:20.963
Not even after I
built us a house

38:21.120 --> 38:23.805
where we could raise tadpoles
and grow old together.

38:23.960 --> 38:27.931
Well, who do you think's been looking
after that house all these years, huh?

38:28.080 --> 38:31.323
Piggy, why do you have to always
be so overdramatic about things?

38:31.480 --> 38:33.721
You know, it leaves me no choice
but to do things that hurt you.

38:33.880 --> 38:37.248
I am who I am.
Why can't you accept that about me?

38:37.400 --> 38:39.209
Look, this is not
about you and me.

38:39.360 --> 38:40.930
It's never about
you and me, is it?

38:41.080 --> 38:43.890
It's always we.
We this, we that.

38:44.040 --> 38:48.364
"We" need you. You can't even
say, "I need you," can you?

38:48.520 --> 38:50.249
Piggy...

38:51.200 --> 38:54.204
I'm sorry, Kermit, but
I have a life here.

38:54.360 --> 38:58.331
A life I've made for myself.

38:59.280 --> 39:00.327
Piggy!

39:00.520 --> 39:05.686
Just remember, Kermit,
I cannot be replaced.

39:13.760 --> 39:17.606
Kermit? What happened?
Where's Miss Piggy?

39:17.760 --> 39:20.081
- She's not coming, Fozzie.

39:20.240 --> 39:22.766
But, Kermit, we always
worked together.

39:22.960 --> 39:24.962
We can't do this
without Miss Piggy.

39:25.120 --> 39:27.088
No one will give us
a show without her.

39:27.240 --> 39:29.004
We'll be fine, Fozzie.

39:30.520 --> 39:32.841
We'll be fine.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.764
We just...

39:34.920 --> 39:37.526
We'll just have to come
up with something else.

39:43.400 --> 39:45.482
Kermie.

39:50.240 --> 39:53.403
OK, I've got an idea.
We need a pig that can sing.

39:53.560 --> 39:56.848
But, Kermit, who could
possibly replace Miss Piggy?

40:08.440 --> 40:11.603
Hey, what's everybody
so quiet about, huh?

40:11.800 --> 40:15.771
- Well, she's sorta like Miss Piggy
- Come on, everybody.

40:15.920 --> 40:19.606
Let's go pitch our telethon and
get the Muppets back on TV, OK?

40:20.960 --> 40:23.201
- No.
- No.

40:26.120 --> 40:27.929
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, that's wonderful!

40:28.080 --> 40:29.411
That means no.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.927
- Come on, guys.
- Awkward.

40:35.080 --> 40:37.731
Listen, Kermit, I like you.

40:37.880 --> 40:39.723
I remember you guys
from when I was a kid.

40:39.880 --> 40:42.724
- So I'm gonna shoot straight.

40:44.960 --> 40:47.725
- You guys aren't
famous any more.

40:47.920 --> 40:49.570
I wish she'd shot a
little more curvy.

40:49.720 --> 40:52.929
Take a look at this diagram the
research department drew up.

40:53.080 --> 40:56.766
This circle represents everything
that's currently popular.

40:58.080 --> 41:00.606
And this tiny speck is you guys.

41:00.760 --> 41:03.001
So the answer's no.
It's not gonna happen.

41:03.160 --> 41:05.970
Take a look at the shows that are popular now.
<i>Punch</i> Teacher.

41:06.120 --> 41:11.126
<i>- Oh! I love that show.
- It's time to punch teacher!</i>

41:11.800 --> 41:13.928
<i>- Finish him!
- It's my favorite.</i>

41:14.080 --> 41:16.765
<i>I just thought I could
make a difference.</i>

41:16.920 --> 41:21.209
I'm sorry, but in this market, you guys
are no longer relevant. Have a good day.

41:32.240 --> 41:35.369
Before I go, I'd just
like to say something.

41:35.520 --> 41:38.729
I think kids are smarter and better
than all this junk, and if you...

41:39.520 --> 41:42.729
Veronica, bad news.
<i>Punch</i> Teacher has stopped production.

41:42.880 --> 41:44.644
It's being sued by the
Teachers Society of America.

41:44.800 --> 41:48.930
- What's their problem?
- No idea. I just found out.

41:49.080 --> 41:51.560
What are we supposed to do with
that 120-minute black hole

41:51.720 --> 41:54.610
in the schedule coming
up in two days?

41:57.440 --> 42:00.046
OK, Muppets.
You've got yourselves a show.

42:00.240 --> 42:02.447
- All right!
- Oh, yes!

42:02.640 --> 42:05.962
Thank you so much.
You will not be sorry, I promise, I promise!

42:06.120 --> 42:10.170
OK, enough! One, no more going nuts in my office.
These are new carpets.

42:10.320 --> 42:13.403
- Yes, ma'am.
- And two, you need a celebrity host.

42:13.560 --> 42:16.769
OK. Whatever, whatever.
Come on, guys, let's go. Yeah!

42:20.600 --> 42:23.046
- Let me wipe that.
- You've missed a spot.

42:23.200 --> 42:24.850
- I don't see it.
- Just a little lower!

42:25.000 --> 42:26.764
- Oh, I am so sorry. Did I get you...
- Yes.

42:26.920 --> 42:31.130
Well, gentlemen.
It appears we have some competition

42:31.280 --> 42:33.328
on the Muppet propel“IY-

42:33.480 --> 42:36.723
The <i>Economist</i> says they've
gotten back together again.

42:36.880 --> 42:39.850
- The Muppets got back together?
- Remember?

42:40.000 --> 42:42.765
<i>♪ Together again Gee,
it's good to be... ♪</i>

42:42.920 --> 42:46.720
Gentlemen, please!
No singing in my office!

42:46.880 --> 42:48.370
- Yes, sir.
- But, of course, it was all his fault.

42:48.520 --> 42:50.682
- Mostly his fault.
- No matter.

42:50.880 --> 42:55.329
Point is, that studio and
that oil belong to me.

42:55.480 --> 42:57.164
Yeah, those Muppets are gonna be

42:57.320 --> 42:59.687
running home with their
tails between their legs.

42:59.840 --> 43:03.003
Some of 'em literally.
Because those ones have tails.

43:03.160 --> 43:06.960
Maniacal laugh, maniacal laugh.

43:10.120 --> 43:11.849
That's a maniacal laugh moment.

43:13.000 --> 43:17.005
OK, this is it.
80's Robot, let's park around back.

43:36.080 --> 43:37.320
<i>It's The Muppet Show,</i>

43:37.480 --> 43:39.960

star, Mr. Bob Hope!</i>

43:40.840 --> 43:43.650

43:49.760 --> 43:53.162
Gary. Can you believe it?

43:54.560 --> 43:58.963
- The Muppet theater.
- Yeah.

44:01.800 --> 44:04.007
- Welcome back, everyone.
- Thanks.

44:04.200 --> 44:06.680
Well, I know the old place is not
quite at its best right now.

44:06.840 --> 44:09.491
Yeah!
Who cancelled the maid service?

44:09.640 --> 44:11.847
But don't worry. We'll be fine.

44:12.040 --> 44:15.886
Kermit, there's no way we can
rehearse with the place like this.

44:16.040 --> 44:18.486
Wait.
Kermit, don't say another word.

44:18.640 --> 44:22.486
Mary, Walter and I, well, we would be
happy to help you rebuild the theater.

44:22.680 --> 44:24.250
Honestly, it would be an
honor for all three of us.

44:24.400 --> 44:27.609
- So would.
- OK. Well, let's clean this place up!

44:27.760 --> 44:29.285
Yeah!

44:34.600 --> 44:37.843
- This is boring.
- But don't you guys remember?

44:38.000 --> 44:41.368
You're the Muppets!
You do this to music!

44:41.520 --> 44:42.965
Well, all right!

44:53.240 --> 44:55.481
- Hey, Animal!
- Yeah?

44:55.640 --> 44:56.721
Look what I found!

45:15.200 --> 45:18.363
- Beauregard!
- Scooter! Good to see you!

45:18.520 --> 45:20.727
Where's everybody been?

45:22.720 --> 45:24.688
Celebrity... celebrity!

45:24.840 --> 45:28.003
Hello! Yes. Could I speak with
President Carter, please?

45:28.200 --> 45:31.602
He moved? Well, you don't happen to have
a number where I could reach... Hello?

45:31.760 --> 45:33.489
Walter, I thought we were
gonna clean the balcony.

45:33.640 --> 45:35.802
- Doing a great job, pal.
- You're doing a great job.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.923
- Wocka wocka.
- Hey, guys!

45:38.080 --> 45:40.401
Look at these old
photos I just found.

45:40.560 --> 45:41.607
Oooh.

45:41.800 --> 45:44.371
Can you believe that 80's
haircut I used to have?

45:44.520 --> 45:46.727
I looked totally ridiculous!

45:51.040 --> 45:53.202
Yes, it's Kermit. The frog.

45:53.360 --> 45:55.601
Could you come to our celebrity
telethon this weekend?

45:55.760 --> 45:57.410
Sure. Sure, I understand.

46:09.320 --> 46:10.845
- Hey, shut the door!
- What is that?

46:11.200 --> 46:13.487
Say hello to the little friend.

46:16.400 --> 46:17.481
There goes dinner.

46:41.640 --> 46:44.166
Wow! Great job, everybody!

46:44.360 --> 46:46.761
Oh, hey, Kermit.
Listen, have a great night,

46:46.920 --> 46:49.764
and I just want you to know, Walter
and I are really good sewers,

46:49.920 --> 46:52.161
so we'll have those costumes
ready for you in no time.

46:52.320 --> 46:55.130
- Good. You two have a great night.
- OK. Thank you!

46:55.280 --> 46:57.601
- Bye.
- Kermit?

46:57.760 --> 46:59.967
Gary, I was kind of hoping that
we could go to the beach tomorrow

47:00.120 --> 47:02.407
- or see the Hollywood Sign.
- We'll have plenty of time

47:02.560 --> 47:04.369
to do that stuff.
It's just, right now,

47:04.520 --> 47:08.081
I don't wanna leave Walter.
You know, he needs me.

47:08.240 --> 47:11.687
I don't know, sweetheart
he seems pretty happy.

47:13.280 --> 47:14.566
- Like that.
- Oh, OK.

47:14.720 --> 47:16.324
Now you.

47:16.520 --> 47:18.887
Yeah, that's it!
Yeah, yeah, good job!

47:19.040 --> 47:22.647
Well, just one more day, OK?
And then I'm all yours.

47:22.800 --> 47:25.804
Tell you what. Why don't you get a
head start on sightseeing tomorrow

47:25.960 --> 47:28.645
and then I'll be waiting
for you when you get back.

47:28.800 --> 47:32.407
OK. Just...
don't forget about me.

47:32.560 --> 47:33.800
Never.

47:33.960 --> 47:35.689
Well, we're still on for
dinner Friday, right?

47:35.840 --> 47:37.365
Yeah, of course.

47:37.520 --> 47:38.885
- Oh, Walter!
- Oh, yes, Kermit.

47:39.080 --> 47:40.923
Hey, listen, Walter, I
just wanna tell you

47:41.080 --> 47:43.242
that none of this would have
happened without you, so thank you.

47:43.400 --> 47:46.131
- Oh, well...
- And welcome aboard.

47:46.280 --> 47:48.442
Night, everybody.
Just sleep anywhere you can find a spot.

47:48.600 --> 47:51.331
"Welcome aboard"?

48:07.000 --> 48:09.128
Hey, Kermit. You awake?

48:09.320 --> 48:11.448
- Yep.
- What's the weather

48:11.600 --> 48:15.810
- supposed to be like tonight?
- I don't know. Why?

48:16.800 --> 48:20.009
I just don't want it to rain
through the hole in the ceiling.

48:20.160 --> 48:21.889
Stars sure are pretty, though.

48:23.920 --> 48:27.561
We're gonna be OK, right?
We haven't done this in a long time,

48:27.720 --> 48:32.123
and I really don't
wanna go back to Reno.

48:32.280 --> 48:34.123
Don't worry, Fozzie.
We'll be fine.

48:34.280 --> 48:37.011
Look how we cleaned this
place up today, you know?

48:37.160 --> 48:39.845
Same old team, all
pulling together.

48:40.000 --> 48:44.085
I guess you're right.
Night-night, Kermit.

48:44.240 --> 48:46.641
Good night, Fozzie.

48:51.320 --> 48:55.370
OK, gather round, troops!
Everybody, time to get this rehearsal going.

48:55.520 --> 48:57.648
- Scooter, is everybody here?
- Almost everyone, chief.

48:57.800 --> 49:00.804
- Yeah...
- Hey, anybody got any kerosene?

49:01.000 --> 49:04.049
I wanna take these old pig
dresses out back and burn 'em.

49:04.200 --> 49:07.204
Hold it right there,
sausage snout!

49:09.480 --> 49:11.005
- Piggy?
- Huh?

49:12.960 --> 49:16.760
Well, look what the
cat dragged in.

49:16.920 --> 49:18.684
Come on. Keep it up, Maurice.

49:18.840 --> 49:24.244
Sorry, Miss Piggy, but you've
been replaced... permanently.

49:24.440 --> 49:27.683
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

49:27.840 --> 49:31.925
I don't think <i>so...</i> sister?

49:32.080 --> 49:36.051
Who you calling sister, sister?

49:36.240 --> 49:38.208
- Oh, look, an omelet station!
- Oh, where?

49:38.360 --> 49:40.089
- Hiya!

49:40.240 --> 49:44.689
There's only one Miss Piggy,
and she is <i>moi.</i>

49:44.840 --> 49:49.687
Yeah, well, you ain't seen the last of me!
I'll be back!

49:49.880 --> 49:51.723
Yeah, yeah. Heard of mouthwash?

49:51.920 --> 49:54.287
- Welcome back, Miss Piggy.

49:54.440 --> 49:56.966
All right, all right,
don't crowd me!

49:57.120 --> 49:59.202
Wow, she sure hasn't changed.

50:01.240 --> 50:03.163
Piggy? You came back.

50:03.320 --> 50:06.961
I'm not here for you, Kermit.
I'm here for them.

50:08.760 --> 50:11.127
And, besides, when
this show's done,

50:11.320 --> 50:14.881
I'm catching the next plane
back to my life in Paris.

50:15.040 --> 50:18.840
OK, Piggy, OK. Places for the
opening number, everybody!

50:20.800 --> 50:22.529
Oh, good morning, Veronica.

50:22.680 --> 50:27.129
- Morning, Frog.
- OK, everybody, take it from the top.

50:27.280 --> 50:29.760
- Oooh!

50:29.960 --> 50:31.962
- You missed your cue.
- I know!

50:33.280 --> 50:35.442
There's kind of a rhythm
to this, you know?

50:36.240 --> 50:41.201
Uh... Oh, and if you like that one,
what's the bear capital of the world?

50:41.360 --> 50:42.964

- Hey, Scooter? What's left?

54:03.520 --> 54:05.727
Oh, uh, it's you, chief!

54:05.880 --> 54:09.441
- Hm?
- Your duet.With Piggy.

54:13.880 --> 54:15.325
- Miss Piggy?
- Hm?

54:15.520 --> 54:17.363
We're all out front
practicing our acts

54:17.560 --> 54:20.040
and seems that everybody expects
you and I to do a duet, so...

54:20.200 --> 54:23.886
Oh, that's so lovely,
but I'm afraid I can't.

54:24.040 --> 54:28.602
No, no, you see, I'm already doing
a duet with my new dance partner.

54:28.960 --> 54:30.564
Hola.

54:30.720 --> 54:32.563
OK, come on, rehearsing, let's go.
We gotta break it up.

54:32.720 --> 54:35.041
- Excuse us.
- 'Scuse us.

54:35.200 --> 54:36.964
Let's try that lift
again, shall we?

54:37.120 --> 54:39.691
The lift again.
OK, on my count this time, OK?

54:39.880 --> 54:42.565
- In three, two... Wait for me!

54:42.720 --> 54:43.801
Good grief.

54:43.960 --> 54:46.645
Kermit! There you are.
I've been looking for you everywhere!

54:46.840 --> 54:48.205
So nice to see you, Veronica.

54:48.360 --> 54:50.283
Who's hosting?
Did you find a celebrity?

54:50.440 --> 54:54.331
Yeah, well, I've wanted to talk to
you about that, you see, because...

54:54.520 --> 54:58.684
Well, actually, I'm
kind of a celebrity.

54:58.840 --> 55:00.171
You?

55:00.320 --> 55:02.129
No. Kermit, listen.

55:02.280 --> 55:06.046
I will not air the show unless
you find a real celebrity host.

55:06.240 --> 55:08.129
I will rerun <i>Benson</i>
if I have to.

55:08.320 --> 55:11.210
Yeah, you see, the
thing is, Veronica,

55:11.360 --> 55:14.204
that's kind of impossible
because the show's in 12 hours!

55:14.360 --> 55:15.850
Twelve hours!

55:16.040 --> 55:20.329
I might as well just go and ask Tex
Richman to give us the studio back!

55:23.160 --> 55:27.290
And the Muppets are like a big family.
Well... And for us,

55:27.440 --> 55:32.844
that theater <i>is...</i> is like our home.
Which is why, in conclusion...

55:33.680 --> 55:37.002
<i>...we</i> humbly ask that
you give us back our studio.

55:39.280 --> 55:42.329
It would certainly
mean a lot to us.

55:42.520 --> 55:44.363
Hmmm.

55:45.240 --> 55:48.244
Well, Mr. The Frog, let me see.

56:20.720 --> 56:22.006
Correct!

56:32.120 --> 56:34.441
The answer is no.

56:35.680 --> 56:38.490
Well, you could've
just said that.

56:38.640 --> 56:40.529
- Contract.
- Contract.

56:40.680 --> 56:41.727
Contract.

56:44.440 --> 56:47.171
- Nicely done, sir.
- You see, Muppets,

56:47.320 --> 56:49.243
according to this contract,

56:49.400 --> 56:53.200
it's not just this studio you
lose the rights to tonight,

56:53.360 --> 56:55.362
- it's the Muppet name itself.
- What?

56:55.520 --> 56:59.127
And all characters
under the Muppet name.

56:59.280 --> 57:02.363
Wait a second. What possible use
could you have for our names?

57:09.920 --> 57:12.161
Told ya I'd be back.

57:12.360 --> 57:14.408
Well, now I am...

57:15.920 --> 57:17.206
...back.

57:17.360 --> 57:22.207
And I see you've met Mr. Richman
our new business partner.

57:22.360 --> 57:28.561
The Moopets are a hard, cynical
act for a hard, cynical world.

57:28.720 --> 57:35.001
Hey, Fozzie!
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

57:37.520 --> 57:41.161
- Wocka wocka.
- You're relics, Muppets!

57:41.320 --> 57:44.608
The world has moved on,
and no one cares about

57:44.760 --> 57:49.721
your goody-goody, hippy-dippy, Julie
Andrews and Dom DeLuise hostin',

57:49.880 --> 57:53.521
singin'-and-dancin' act any more!
You're dead!

57:53.680 --> 57:56.923
- And I just come to bury you.

57:57.840 --> 58:01.401
Now, get out of my office.

58:01.560 --> 58:03.085
- What?
- What is that supposed to mean?

58:03.240 --> 58:04.651
You said you were gonna
talk to the man!

58:04.800 --> 58:09.089
Guys! OK, so maybe Kermit
signed away the theater

58:09.240 --> 58:12.961
and the Muppet name, but as long
as we have a celebrity host,

58:13.120 --> 58:16.920
we can still pull off a heart-warming,
last-minute triumph, right, Kermit?

58:18.120 --> 58:21.806
Well, actually I don't
see how we can, Fozzie.

58:21.960 --> 58:23.166
- Huh?
- What?

58:23.320 --> 58:24.970
Guys, the show's in six hours,

58:25.120 --> 58:29.762
and we're barely rehearsed,
and, well, <i>I...</i>

58:29.920 --> 58:31.763
I couldn't get us
a celebrity host.

58:31.920 --> 58:34.002
- Oh, no!
- What?

58:34.840 --> 58:39.607
I'm afraid Tex Richman's right.
The world's moved on.

58:39.760 --> 58:41.728
I'm sorry I dragged you
guys into this mess.

58:42.840 --> 58:44.763
Kermit?

58:49.240 --> 58:52.084
All right, listen
up, you freaks!

58:52.240 --> 58:54.846
I didn't come 5,000
miles to not be on TV.

58:55.000 --> 58:59.642
All we need is one stinkin' celebrity,
and by any means necessary.

58:59.800 --> 59:04.840
Now, the frog's gone.
We're doing things my way from now on.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.490
Let's move!

59:09.040 --> 59:11.247
- Hey!
- Hi.

59:11.440 --> 59:14.444
- How was your day?
- Oh, it was great.

59:14.600 --> 59:17.763
I went to Guinness Book of
World Records... alone.

59:17.920 --> 59:20.287
Then Ripley's Believe It or Not...
solo.

59:20.440 --> 59:22.886
And then I ate lunch
unaccompanied,

59:23.080 --> 59:26.243
and then I walked back here...
independently.

59:26.400 --> 59:29.165
Listen, I got you these.

59:29.320 --> 59:32.563
You know, to make up for the other ones.
The broken ones.

59:33.640 --> 59:35.324
Thanks, sweetie.

59:36.920 --> 59:38.445
Listen, Gary.

59:38.600 --> 59:41.809
I was just wondering what the
plan was for dinner tonight.

59:41.960 --> 59:43.405
Oh, I don't care.
What do you feel like?

59:45.560 --> 59:48.291
OK. That's fine.

59:48.480 --> 59:51.689
That's just fine. That's...
that's perfect.

59:53.280 --> 59:55.248
I'm going to go for a walk.

59:55.440 --> 59:57.761
- Individually.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.364
- Walter, hey.
- Gary.

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:11.649
Oh, where have you been?
I need you to help me figure out a talent.

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.325
A talent for what?

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:17.485
For the show. Kermit asked
me to do an act in the show.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:20.371
<i>I...</i> I could be a Muppet.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:24.364
Wow.
Wow, Walter, that's amazing.

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:27.285
Yeah, but I need to figure
out if I have a talent.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.761
Well, you know what?
I'm sure you'll think of something,

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:32.446
but right now I actually...
I need your help.

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:35.683
I'm starting to get the feeling that
Mary's upset with me about something,

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:39.287
and I don't know what, and I was hoping
maybe you would talk to her for me.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.566
Gary, I'd love to help you out,

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:43.769
but I can't leave the theater now.
This is important.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:46.969
Well, hold on a second.
I mean, my life is important, too

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.447
Yeah, but the whole reason we
came here was to see the Muppets.

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.967
No, it wasn't!
The whole reason we came here

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.441
was to take a vacation where I
took Mary out to a fancy dinner

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:56.284
because it's our tenth
anniversary, and then...

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.321
- Walter, what day is today?
- Friday.

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:04.404
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:08.121
This is bad. Walter, this is really bad.
I have to...

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:11.011
- Mary? Mary!
- Wait.

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:14.369
Gary, I need you.

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.209
OK, is everybody ready?

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:34.682
Commence Operation Celebri-nap.
Masks on!

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:37.081
- Masks on!
- Except for <i>moi.</i>

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.765
Nothing covers this
beautiful face.

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:43.329
No maskin'? - No maskin'.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.923
Check the door on Stage 28.

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.526
<i>- I'm going over there now.
- She's done in makeup...</i>

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:01.363
I told you, I'm not done
putting on my balls!

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:07.285
Oh, hey, Animal.

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:09.607
What are you doin' here?

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:13.890
Acting. Natural.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.241
Now!

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:17.487
Whoa!

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:21.404
- Hiya!

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:37.006
Hiya!

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.086
Mary, surprise!
I figured out why you're mad... at me.

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.849
<i>Gary, I've gone home.</i>

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:01.601

Kermit. We have our celebrity!

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:04.967
Mr. Jack Black has graciously
agreed to do the telethon!

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:07.566
Oh, my gosh, that's amazing.
Where is he?

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.644
- In the trunk.
- Get me outta here!

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:13.724
You kidnapped Jack Black?
That's illegal!

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:18.442
But, Kermit, what's more illegal,
briefly inconveniencing Jack Black,

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:23.128
- or destroying the Muppets?
- Kidnapping Jack Black, Fozzie!

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:26.568
Kermit, listen.
Whatever I may think of you right now,

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:29.405
these guys are counting on you.
You inspire them.

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:32.291
- What, to kidnap people?
- To work together.

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:36.286
- To kidnap people?
- Mr. The Frog, we all agreed

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:39.125
a celebrity is not a people.

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:42.648
And now that we have a
celebrity, the show's back on.

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:46.407
Come on, Kermit.
Don't let these guys down now.

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:53.131
All right. Well, what are you
guys still doing here, huh?

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:54.731
- It's showtime!
- All right!

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:55.927
That's it!

01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:01.201
- Nicely done, sir. As usual.
- En garde.

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.569
Ow! Ow.

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.961
OK, very nice.

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:09.282
Halt! Point left!

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:12.250
Well done, sir. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:15.768
<i>And coming up next on CDE,
The Muppet Telethon.</i>

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:18.321
<i>Kermit and friends host a
celebrity-studded gala,</i>

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:22.166
<i>- with special guest, Jack Black.
- Oh! He's pretty good.</i>

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:28.400
- We're going to phase two.
- Yes, Mr. Richman.

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:33.563
So do you think we're
working for the bad guy?

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:40.688
Hurry!
The show starts in ten minutes!

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:44.724
Where did you learn to drive?

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.968
Hang on, everyone!

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:56.885
Come on, guys. OK, listen up, everybody!
This is it! Five minutes to curtain!

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.042
- Kermit?
- Get ready for the opening number.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.884
- Yes?
- I need to talk to you about my act.

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:02.883
Listen, Walter, I know
you're gonna be fine.

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.122
In fact, I'm sure you'll be great.
Scooter, who's up first?

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.645
- Come on, come on, come on!
- No...

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.165
Fly in the arches!

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:12.406
- OK, first we have the opening theme.
- Of course. Yeah.

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:14.369
- You come out and introduce Fozzie.
- Right.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:17.205
Then we have...
TV executive at six o'clock!

01:08:17.399 --> 01:08:20.210
- What?
- The show is a disaster, Frog!

01:08:20.359 --> 01:08:22.442
- Veronica...
- Where's the audience?

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:25.046
I knew you guys weren't
popular any more.

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:28.210
I should have trusted that chart.
There's no one here!

01:08:28.359 --> 01:08:30.010
- What about Hobo Joe?
- Who?

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:32.640
Why does everybody
forget about Hobo Joe?

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:34.564
- Just a second. Scooter!
- Yeah, chief?

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:38.441
- Did you hand out all those flyers?
- Of course. Every last one!

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:41.001
Don't worry.
We'll think of something!

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.491
- You better

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:44.682
Yoo-hoo! You've got audience.

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:47.649
It's me! What am I, invisible?

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:50.006
- Jack Black.

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.924
Fifteen seconds to
curtain, Mr. Black

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:55.081
- Hi!
- Ah! Where am I?

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:58.368
Why am I so fancy? What are you doing?
You're ruining my look!

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.921
- We'll see you out there! Good luck!
- Stop cleaning me!

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:05.085
- You sure got nice teeth, Jack Black.
- Yeah.

01:09:06.439 --> 01:09:07.487
We're here!

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:10.120
- Start the show!
- Ready for some kind of entertainment!

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:12.487
All right, good luck,
everyone, and cue Scooter.

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:15.564

We have Muppets standing

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.489
- Yes, we are.
- Hi. Hello.

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.961
Could I have a large
pizza with ham and...?

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:32.243
Yes, and, boy, do we have
a wonderful show for you,

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:35.370
with our special guest,
Mr. Jack Black!

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.529
I'm being held captive
by these weirdos!

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:43.809
Now you know how we've felt
for the past 40 years!

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:47.248
Somebody, anybody, please call the police.
This is real rope!

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:50.529
- Man, this 3-D is incredible!
- This is real!

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.451
<i>Oh, and by the way, folks, we have
plenty of room here in the audience,</i>

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:57.042
<i>so if you'd like to come down
and see the show live...</i>

01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:00.841
There's no audience in the theater.
Look, it's totally empty.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.529
Poor Walter.

01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:09.050
Maybe we should go back.

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:13.928
No way, Mary.
I've made my choice already.

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:15.884
I just sang a whole
song about it.

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:18.481
I wanna stay here with you.

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:21.566
So thank you.

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:31.447
Ladies and gentlemen,
prepare yourselves

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:35.201
for the Great Gonzo's
most amazing feat ever.

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.649
- Head bowling.
- What? No!

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:39.165
I have not signed off on this!

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.607
- Drumroll, please.

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:47.680
- And a one and a
two and a three!

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:50.810
Uh-oh. Uh...
My fingers got stuck.

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:53.486
All part of the act, folks.
Stay tuned.

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:56.968
<i>Please, make this end! Please!</i>

01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:58.605
This is great. Call 'em.

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:07.928
Hello?

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:11.243
You wanna give us some money?!
Uhhh...

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:14.961
- Say yes!
- Yes! We will take that money!

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:19.569
Hey, guys, we got us some money!

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:24.806
Oh, yeah, tickets. Here we are.
Tickets. Thank you.

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:28.726
Five dollars to show you your seat.
It's up there somewhere.

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:31.804
- Help!
- OK, thank you, Gonzo.

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:34.531
Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen,
we will see what happens with

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:36.808
head bowling a little
later in the show.

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:41.409
Up next is our furry funny
man, Mr. Fozzie Bear! Yay!

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:45.007
Thank you, thank you,
and thank you.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:47.925
Boy, did I go to a bad
seafood place last night.

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:52.051
The catch of the day was salmonella.
Wocka wocka!

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:55.249
- OK.
- Ah! That joke's like 50 years old!

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:58.204
So how 'bout those
shopping centers?

01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:00.806
You seen one, you seen a mall!
Take it.

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.883
Make it stop!

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:09.851
- Wocka wocka wocka wocka!
- Make it stop! No!

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.322
<i>- We're not a team! I'm not with him!
- What is happening?</i>

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:16.529
People are actually
watching this?

01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:20.127
Deadly! Bring the car!

01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:22.171
What am I gonna do?

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:23.446
- What am I gonna do?

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:26.285
Walter? Sixty seconds
till you're on, Walter.

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:28.249
You ready?

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:31.449
<i>No. Yes, yes, yes...</i>

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:34.123
Whoopi Goldberg?

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:36.965
Selena Gomez? And... hi there.

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:40.963
Yeah, look, somebody said there
might be a career opportunity here

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:43.521
- something about saving a theater.
- Yes, yes, of course.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:46.286
I don't really know who you guys are
My agent just told me to show up.

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:47.720
- That's great.
- Are you one of the

01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:49.086
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:52.005
Yes, I am, and let me show
you how you can help.

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:55.642
And don't worry.
It's just your one shot to go on live TV

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.928
before millions of people to
prove you have what it takes

01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:00.805
to become one of the Muppets.
Good luck.

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:07.211
Up next, folks, I am proud
to present a brand-new act

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:10.170
to the show. Introducing Walter.

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:21.891
That's not good.

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:27.127
It appears that Walter has
stepped out, so it's...

01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:31.330
Well, it's back to the days of
yore down at the old barbershop.

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:48.449
Oh, no! It's a barbershop quartet!
Get me out of here!

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.763
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:57.161
Is that Nirvana? Stop it! No!

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:04.727
You're ruining one of the
greatest songs of all time!

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:08.811
Ow!

01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:12.370
Careful around the ears!

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:33.531
Ah! That was hot!

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:36.843
Hey! What's going on here?
Why is my body so big?

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.606
<i>What'd you do to my voice?
I sound like a chipmunk!</i>

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:41.882
Wait a second.
Did you guys shrink my head?

01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:44.884
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jack Black!

01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:50.763
Nice work, everybody.
Chickens, you're up next!

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:53.287
It's going rather nicely.
We might just make this

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:56.202
And now I am pleased
and proud to present

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:59.643
those princesses of poultry,
Camilla and friends!

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:47.486
Let's hear it for Camilla
and her farmyard friends!

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:51.964
No, I... I don't know why
I'm not hosting this.

01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:54.691
So remember, folks, keep on calling
and you'll help us reach our goal

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:57.451
of ten million dollars by midnight.
And if...

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:00.487
Oh, dear.

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:01.846
Ladies and gentlemen,
don't be alarmed.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.810
We will get this sorted out just
as soon as we can. Scooter!

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:14.130
Well, that's that.
Nice try, Muppets!

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:22.044
Kermit, how are we going to
raise the rest of the money

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:23.366
with no electricity?

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:25.761
All right, calm down, everybody.

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:32.365
- Is everybody OK?
- Yeah.

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:35.091
Well, we can't do the
show without power.

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:38.164
- Anybody got any bright ideas?
- Not now, Fozzie.

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.687
Ten-gauge gator grip.

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:44.687
I love it when you talk shop.

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.004
Oh!

<i>♪ La la la la la la

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:02.651
What?
How'd they get the power back?

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:05.883
We're gonna have to
get up on that roof

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:09.487
and shut 'em down for good!
Bolt cutters!

01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:11.847
Bolt cutters.

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:14.247
Deadly! You come with me.

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:18.251
That's it.

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:19.765
Hm.

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:30.041
To the end of the Muppets!

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:34.202
Deadly! What are you doing?

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:35.964
Enough!

01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:40.648
Just because I have a terrifying
name and an evil English accent,

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:43.849
does not preclude the
fact that, in my heart,

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.881
I am a Muppet, not a Moopet!

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:52.806
Looks like it's I who
will have the last laugh!

01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:56.487
- What does that mean?
- It's an idiom, you idiot,

01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:00.486
because you cannot laugh! Ha ha!

01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:02.165
- Oopsie.

01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:05.166
Deadly.

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:09.404
Now that's a maniacal
laugh for you!

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:12.564
Hey, Gary, Mary, how'd you
guys get here so fast?

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:14.802
We travelled by map.
We thought it'd be quicker.

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:18.009
Hey, I'm sorry I bailed.
I just...

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:20.242
I realized you don't let
the most important person

01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:22.727
in your world slip away.

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:31.969
- Hey, Scooter?
- Yeah?

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:34.481
Could you do me a favor and
take over hosting duty?

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:37.450
But, chief, I don't go onstage.

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:41.161
Well, just do what I do.
Pretend that the audience is naked.

01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:42.890
<i>Yeah, but, I...</i>

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:44.929
<i>Ha...</i> ha... ha...

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:48.486
Uh, Miss Piggy?

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.322
- You are all naked.

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:09.891
Well, sorta.

01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:13.567
OK. Great!
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:16.803
please welcome, a real hero...

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:28.931
You saved it?
After all this time?

01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:32.084
Oh, Kermie.

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:45.806
I guess I'm not that good at
saying this kind of stuff.

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:48.122
- Yes, Kermie?
- Well...

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:53.770
...over the last week,
I realized that...

01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:56.526
I miss you.

01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:00.882
And I need you.

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:07.644
And maybe you don't need the,
the whole world to love you.

01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:11.962
Maybe you just need one person.

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:18.291
It's time for our song, and if we
don't raise the money tonight,

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.841
it might be the last
time we sing together.

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:26.643
And... Well, are you ready?

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:29.529

Ladies and gentlemen,

01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:29.249
it's almost midnight and we haven't
quite reached our target yet,

01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:33.928
but if you'll all just stick around,
we'll be right back with our final act.

01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:38.005
The Muppet Telethon <i>will</i>
return after these messages.

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:44.721
Walter?
Walter, where are you, buddy?

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:48.521
Listen, everybody, the show ran short,
and we don't have anything else planned.

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:51.564
We need one last act
to bring us home.

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:54.530
I'm gonna go check on Jack Black
and see if he has any ideas.

01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:56.011
You guys see if you can
come up with something.

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.208
We have two minutes!
Two minutes!

01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:01.722
- Think, think, think!
- What am I thinking?

01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:05.202
Walter. Walt!

01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:07.929
- Walter!
- Gary?

01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:11.522
- Wha... You came back.
- Walter.

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:13.409
What are you doing down here?

01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:17.201
They just need one more act.
You gotta get out there and help those guys.

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:21.809
I can't. What if people laugh at me?
<i>I...</i>

01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:26.522
I'd rather go back home to Smalltown.
With you.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.810
Look, Walter, you're my brother,

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:37.569
and I'm always gonna love you, but
you belong here, with these guys.

01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:40.849
Hey, you're the one who
got Kermit to do this.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.571
You're the one who brought
everyone here together.

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:48.362
You always believe in other
people, but that's easy.

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:51.888
Sooner or later, you gotta
believe in yourself, too,

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:55.050
because that's what
growing up is.

01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:58.964
It's becoming who
you want to be.

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:02.841
You have to try. Please, Walter.

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:06.446
You're my hero.

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:22.084
OK, Jack Black's got nothing.
What did you guys come up with?

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:25.648
- Bunsen can set Beaker on fire.
- No, no, no, we can't do that.

01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:28.565
- I could break out the fart shoes.
- No, no, no, that will never work!

01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:29.881
<i>We're back in three, two...</i>

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:34.171
Oh, no!

01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:52.050
It's Walter.

01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:54.724
Thank you.

01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:59.124
- He's all grown up.
- Oh, that was wonderful!

01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:04.921
Ladies and gentlemen, Walter!

01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:07.686
It looks like we're going
to get our studio back!

01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:11.930
the Muppets are about to
take back their studio.

01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:21.285
Help! I've been mugged.
Alerting authorities.

01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:23.847
<i>We're sorry...
- What happened? Hello?</i>

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.685
- Hello?
- Guys, my phone is dead.

01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:32.370
My phone is also dead.
Repeat, my phone is also dead.

01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:36.730
Ooh...

01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:51.601
I did it. I beat you.

01:28:54.840 --> 01:29:00.006
Game over, Kermit. You lost.

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:02.847
Chicky!

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:07.244
Too late, Muppets. I won!
Turn that thing off!

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:10.887
- The show is over!

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:12.804
But we were so close!

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:20.527
Or not.

01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:22.808
It kinda makes me feel
better, honestly.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.606
I mean, we were
nowhere close at all.

01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:29.845
You artists formerly
known as the Muppets

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.810
are standing on
private property.

01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:35.850
My private property

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.810
And I'm telling you to leave.
Now!

01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:49.765
He's right, everybody.

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:53.481
He won. We gotta go.

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:07.730
Not now, Fozzie.

01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:13.646
- I can't believe this.
- I know.

01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:21.322
Well, that's that.

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:29.487
This isn't right.

01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:31.529
It can't end like this.

01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:33.523
But what can we do?

01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:52.169
Listen, everybody, we've got nothing
to be ashamed of. And you know why?

01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:58.371
Well, because thanks to
Walter here, we tried.

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:00.807
And if we failed,
we failed together,

01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:06.285
and to me, that's
not failing at all.

01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:09.245
And I don't care what
anybody <i>says.</i>

01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:15.686
And I don't care if no one
believes in us, because I believe.

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:18.889
- I believe in you.
- Huh?

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:21.168
- And you.
- Me?

01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:25.211
- And you.

01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:28.284
You know, what's important
isn't this building or a name.

01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:31.171
It's each other. So I say, fine,

01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:33.926
let's just start at the bottom and
work our way back up to the top.

01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:37.084
Yeah.
- Let's all walk out through these doors

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:42.690
with our heads held high.
As a family.

01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:46.731
- Because that's what we are.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:41.290
