39:51.857 --> 39:54.493
Well, the woman
is pissed off.

39:54.526 --> 39:56.962
I do not blame her,
being married
to that bastard.

- Ask me, I'm glad he's dead.
- Okay, Doug, I hear you.

40:02.868 --> 40:04.870
He says he has deep regrets.

40:04.903 --> 40:09.508
And, uh,

40:09.541 --> 40:12.511
that he was havin' a big ol'
midlife crisis and--

40:15.180 --> 40:17.583
He had a horrible
midlife crisis.

40:17.616 --> 40:20.018
He gained 80 pounds
and lost all his hair.

40:20.051 --> 40:22.020
He's gained a lot of weight
and he's gone bald.

I don't give a shit
about his hair.

was foreclosed on...

40:28.527 --> 40:30.696
and my electricity
was shut off.

40:30.729 --> 40:34.132
His children spent a month
in a homeless shelter.

40:34.165 --> 40:36.067
How does he feel
about that?

40:36.101 --> 40:38.504

more than he could bear.

40:52.818 --> 40:56.488
He says...
he missed his kids.

40:56.522 --> 40:58.557
Well, he sure didn't
act like it.

how most of the time...

41:12.203 --> 41:14.573
he's not even really sure
who he is anymore.

41:18.944 --> 41:22.548
- Oh, Doug.
- Tell her anything.

41:28.153 --> 41:30.221
He says he-he's sorry

he wanted to hurt.

done it different,

ask for forgiveness.
