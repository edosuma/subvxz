WEBVTT

00:00.801 --> 00:02.702
<i>Previously on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:02.703 --> 00:03.569
Who should be going home
tonight?

00:03.570 --> 00:05.271
Clemenza.

00:05.272 --> 00:07.773
The blue team
turned their backs on Clemenza.

00:07.774 --> 00:10.009
Everybody's trying
to get rid of me.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.811
But you know what,
I still put out better food

00:11.812 --> 00:12.845
than everybody standing there.

00:12.846 --> 00:13.913
But chef Ramsay chose...
Guy.

00:13.914 --> 00:16.047
<i>Give me your jacket, please.</i>

00:16.049 --> 00:18.184
The next morning, in the
mystery ingredients challenge...

00:18.185 --> 00:19.397
Veal chop.

00:19.398 --> 00:21.300
First come, first serve,
bitches!

00:21.301 --> 00:22.888
It was Royce on the blue team...

00:22.889 --> 00:24.890
<i>What is that?
A hair.</i>

00:24.891 --> 00:26.425
Who made a careless
and unforgivable error...

00:26.426 --> 00:28.094
Oh, God.

00:28.095 --> 00:30.162
Clinching the
victory for the red team.

00:30.163 --> 00:33.299
You've gotta be kidding me,
man.

00:33.300 --> 00:36.435
At dinner service,
Tiffany was anything...

00:36.436 --> 00:38.904
Tiffany, you're putting the
knife on the bottom of your lip?

00:38.905 --> 00:40.973
But sharp...
Tiffany!

00:40.974 --> 00:43.275
I mean, honestly?
In the blue kitchen.

00:43.276 --> 00:45.845
Clemenza, this pasta is
chewy!

00:45.846 --> 00:47.646
And Brian...
Yes, chef.

00:47.647 --> 00:48.781
It's soupy.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.583
Soupy?
You know it is.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.251
Got off to a
slow start on appetizers.

00:52.252 --> 00:55.187
No, no, no, no.
Not already.

00:55.188 --> 00:56.689
But they quickly rebounded.

00:56.690 --> 00:59.125
There you go. Finally.

00:59.126 --> 01:01.060
Brian. Perfect.
Yes, chef.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.262
But when it came
time to serve entrees...

01:03.263 --> 01:05.131
Raw.
Roshni...

01:05.132 --> 01:08.134
Our first table!
And Patrick...

01:08.135 --> 01:10.136
Patrick.
Lobster's stone cold.

01:10.137 --> 01:11.637
Brought the
kitchen to a standstill...

01:11.638 --> 01:13.205
All of you get out!

01:13.206 --> 01:15.341
Totally useless.
Get out!

01:15.342 --> 01:17.009
Forcing the red team...

01:17.010 --> 01:18.511
Ladies...
Yes, chef.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.479
To feed the blue team's diners.

01:20.480 --> 01:21.914
You're coming to the blue team.
Let's go. Yes, chef.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.883
All hands on deck.
Let's go.

01:23.884 --> 01:25.785
At elimination,
the blue team nominated...

01:25.786 --> 01:27.319
Myself, chef.
And...

01:27.320 --> 01:29.121
Clemenza, chef.
What?

01:29.122 --> 01:30.956
Chef Ramsay was stunned.

01:30.957 --> 01:33.058
The stumbling block
wasn't the appetizers.

01:33.059 --> 01:35.594
And so he offered
up his own nomination.

01:35.595 --> 01:39.365
Roshni, Patrick, get up here.
Fish and meat.

01:39.366 --> 01:42.434
And then chef Ramsay decided
to get some blue team opinions.

01:42.435 --> 01:43.936
Who shall I send home?
Roshni, chef.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.271
Roshni.
Roshni, chef.

01:45.272 --> 01:46.939
Patrick, chef.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.875
Royce was the only
one to single out Patrick.

01:49.876 --> 01:52.178
In the end...
Roshni.

01:52.179 --> 01:54.346
Gave up her
jacket and her dream

01:54.347 --> 01:56.749
of becoming head chef
at Gordon Ramsay's Steak

01:56.750 --> 01:59.718
at Paris, Las Vegas.

03:00.413 --> 03:04.717
off!

03:04.718 --> 03:06.619
Christina.
Yes, chef.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.621
Three stars. Amazing.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.256
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

03:10.257 --> 03:12.892
Keep it going.
I will. Thank you, chef.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.793
I definitely wasn't
expecting that.

03:14.794 --> 03:16.629
It really is a nice boost,
you know,

03:16.630 --> 03:18.297
getting that compliment
from chef Ramsay,

03:18.298 --> 03:20.432
getting that little bit
of recognition.

03:20.433 --> 03:22.268
It felt real good
to me.

03:22.269 --> 03:24.670
It's gonna be the ladies
taking it to the final.

03:24.671 --> 03:27.039
Said that from day one.
Yep.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.174
The vibe on the red team is
we're confident,

03:29.175 --> 03:31.844
we're determined... we killed
dinner service tonight.

03:31.845 --> 03:34.313
I mean, we didn't just, like,
inch by these guys.

03:34.314 --> 03:36.282
We murdered these dudes.

03:36.283 --> 03:37.950
We're all coming together,

03:37.951 --> 03:39.585
and we're about to dominate
this competition.

03:39.586 --> 03:42.955
Like, dude, that was
one order of spaghetti.

03:42.956 --> 03:45.024
It's up, you know.
I know what I'm dealing with.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.892
I'm dealing with
some team members

03:46.893 --> 03:48.694
that are gonna put you up
because they're afraid

03:48.695 --> 03:50.296
you're gonna knock them out
the box,

03:50.297 --> 03:51.964
and they're afraid
of the competition.

03:51.965 --> 03:54.366
But you know what,
I'm still standing here,

03:54.367 --> 03:56.135
I'm still standing
strong,

03:56.136 --> 03:57.569
and I'm still
going for it, man.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.204
All I know is we're here,
and that's it.

03:59.205 --> 04:00.806
That's it, dude.

04:00.807 --> 04:02.374
While some
members of the blue team

04:02.375 --> 04:04.877
are feeling vindicated,

04:04.878 --> 04:06.512
other's are feeling persecuted.

04:06.513 --> 04:08.314
<i>All the sea bass
went out great,</i>

04:08.315 --> 04:10.282
and I communicated everything.

04:10.283 --> 04:12.051
I don't know why you sent me,
but whatever, it's fine.

04:12.052 --> 04:13.585
Royce, he's sneaky.
Who should go home? "Patrick."

04:13.586 --> 04:15.587
That was a punk-ass move.
him.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.356
Now I'm pissed.

04:17.357 --> 04:20.091
I thought that the lobsters
were a on you.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.060
<i>I didn't you...
No, no, I know, but...</i>

04:22.062 --> 04:23.562
You want to be
a squirmy little ,

04:23.563 --> 04:26.498
somebody's gonna
you up.

04:26.499 --> 04:29.702
After a night of poor
performances on the blue team,

04:29.703 --> 04:32.371
the men go to bed
feeling deflated.

04:37.811 --> 04:40.279
But in the morning,
Kimmie has a plan...

04:40.280 --> 04:42.748
I don't know, I was
just bored yesterday,

04:42.749 --> 04:45.183
so I got down and wrote a rap.

04:45.184 --> 04:48.386
To lift everyone's spirits.

04:48.387 --> 04:50.455
Deep down, I love to cook,
and it's my passion.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.891
But I also have this side thing
with rapping.

04:52.892 --> 04:56.094
So you know, I was ready to show
'em that I could rap too.

04:56.095 --> 04:57.963

Rise and shine.

05:32.532 --> 05:34.966
Big smile.
Let's go.

05:34.967 --> 05:37.936
We walk into the kitchen,
there's a big gold sheet.

05:37.937 --> 05:39.838
It's a new car!
No, um...

05:39.839 --> 05:41.740
I don't know what's
under there.

05:41.741 --> 05:44.543
I honestly, at this point...
I don't have a clue.

05:44.544 --> 05:46.845
To start today, I have
a question for you all.

05:46.846 --> 05:49.147
Are you feeling lucky?
Yes, chef.

05:49.148 --> 05:51.116
<i>Good. As you know,</i>

05:51.117 --> 05:53.418
<i>the winner of Hell's Kitchen
this year</i>

05:53.419 --> 05:57.322
will become the head chef at
Gordon Ramsay's Steak in Vegas.

05:57.323 --> 06:01.326
And let's be honest, it's a city
where luck on your side

06:01.327 --> 06:02.594
can be valuable.

06:02.595 --> 06:04.095
I don't get it.

06:04.096 --> 06:06.197
What the is behind
this gold curtain?

06:06.198 --> 06:07.465
Just tell me!

06:07.466 --> 06:09.234
For your next challenge,
I thought

06:09.235 --> 06:13.138
I would bring
a little bit of Vegas to you.

06:14.907 --> 06:16.441
<i>There we are!</i>

06:18.744 --> 06:20.679
Holy !
Slots! Whoo!

06:20.680 --> 06:23.615
That's awesome. Let's go.
Yeah.

06:23.616 --> 06:25.116
Okay, in today's challenge,

06:25.117 --> 06:27.218
<i>we're gonna test
your creativity.</i>

06:27.219 --> 06:30.522
And we're gonna let
the slot machine determine

06:30.523 --> 06:31.923
what you're gonna be making.

06:31.924 --> 06:33.592
<i>Wow.
Two at a time,</i>

06:33.593 --> 06:35.327
one member from each team
will come up.

06:35.328 --> 06:36.661
One of you will
pull the handle.

06:36.662 --> 06:37.762
<i>When the machine stops,</i>

06:37.763 --> 06:39.030
you'll have five ingredients.

06:39.031 --> 06:40.298
<i>One cut of steak,</i>

06:40.299 --> 06:41.900
and four complementary
ingredients.

06:41.901 --> 06:47.005
And then, you both
will create that dish.

06:47.006 --> 06:49.541
I love steak!
Bring me the beef!

06:49.542 --> 06:52.277
Where's the beef?

06:52.278 --> 06:55.113
Red team, there's six
members in the team.

06:55.114 --> 06:57.015
And I'll only taste
five dishes.

06:57.016 --> 07:00.151
<i>So it's up to you now,
very quickly, to decide</i>

07:00.152 --> 07:02.420
who will not be getting a turn
at the slots.

07:02.421 --> 07:04.723
Hurry up.

07:04.724 --> 07:06.891
I really like steaks, I'm
really good at cooking steaks.

07:06.892 --> 07:08.960
I don't want to sit out
the challenges.

07:08.961 --> 07:11.296
I don't think anybody wants
to be the one to sit out.

07:11.297 --> 07:13.064
We all need the opportunity
to shine.

07:13.065 --> 07:14.332
I feel good about steaks.

07:14.333 --> 07:16.468
Chef's opening a steak house,

07:16.469 --> 07:18.603
so I want to make
a steak dish for him.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.772
We've done really well
in all the challenges,

07:20.773 --> 07:22.307
so I don't want to sit out.

07:22.308 --> 07:24.175
Nobody wants to be, like,
the person

07:24.176 --> 07:25.443
whose dish doesn't count.

07:25.444 --> 07:26.878
Like, if you're sitting out,

07:26.879 --> 07:28.346
you're obviously
not proving .

07:28.347 --> 07:30.582
Who's sitting out?

07:30.583 --> 07:32.317
<i>Make your decision!</i>

07:39.930 --> 07:42.165
In today's
"High-Steaks" challenge,

07:42.166 --> 07:44.400
five members of each team
will go head to head...

07:44.401 --> 07:47.036
Red team, there's six members
in the team.

07:47.037 --> 07:49.205
And I'll only taste
five dishes.

07:49.206 --> 07:52.241
Leaving the red
team with a difficult decision.

07:52.242 --> 07:54.143
So who will not be
getting a turn at the slots?

07:54.144 --> 07:55.311
Hurry up.

07:55.312 --> 07:57.747
I mean, I feel
we've done really well

07:57.748 --> 08:00.683
in all the challenges,
so I don't want to sit out.

08:00.684 --> 08:02.685
It's pointless to try
to talk to these girls

08:02.686 --> 08:04.253
'cause all they do is
bicker over each other.

08:04.254 --> 08:05.421
I'll sit out.
It's cool.

08:05.422 --> 08:07.423
I'll sit out.
Totally cool.

08:07.424 --> 08:09.692
Dana goes, "me and Christina
have been doing the best

08:09.693 --> 08:11.227
in all the challenges,
so we don't need to sit out."

08:11.228 --> 08:13.896
You know, they want to show off
their , let 'em show it.

08:13.897 --> 08:15.565
Dana and Patrick, let's go.

08:15.566 --> 08:17.467
First up, Dana and Patrick

08:17.468 --> 08:19.669
will give the Hell's Kitchen
slot machine a spin

08:19.670 --> 08:21.104
to find out the steak
and ingredients

08:21.105 --> 08:22.805
they will be cooking.

08:22.806 --> 08:25.108
Here we go. You're pulling
for both teams, remember.

08:25.109 --> 08:27.176
We've got protein...

08:27.177 --> 08:29.011
<i>Flat iron.
Flat iron.</i>

08:29.012 --> 08:30.880
Flat iron steak?
I don't...

08:30.881 --> 08:32.381
I don't buy that at home.
I don't cook that .

08:32.383 --> 08:34.583
<i>Potatoes.
Potatoes.</i>

08:34.585 --> 08:37.120
Mushrooms.

08:37.121 --> 08:39.822
Spinach.

08:39.823 --> 08:41.991
Blue cheese. Wow.

08:41.991 --> 08:43.926
<i>Good job.</i>

08:43.927 --> 08:46.796
Oh, my God, Dana has got
the perfect dish.

08:46.797 --> 08:50.099
Spinach, sauteed mushrooms.
Like, she's got this.

08:50.100 --> 08:51.601
That's perfect karma
right there.

08:51.602 --> 08:53.503
Beautiful, Pat.
Christina and Royce.

08:53.504 --> 08:55.104
<i>Awesome.
Let's go.</i>

08:55.105 --> 08:56.906
It's the christina/Royce
challenge.

08:56.907 --> 08:59.675
The last time I went up
against Christina,

08:59.676 --> 09:02.078
I was beaten. I was beaten, man,
fair and square.

09:02.079 --> 09:03.513
Royce and Christina.

09:03.514 --> 09:05.948
<i>Royce, three.</i>

09:05.949 --> 09:07.717
<i>Christina.</i>

09:07.718 --> 09:09.185
Yay!

09:09.186 --> 09:10.586
<i>Thank you, chef.</i>

09:10.587 --> 09:12.088
I mean, I hope every challenge

09:12.089 --> 09:13.289
I get to go up against her.

09:13.290 --> 09:14.590
I'm gonna beat this girl.

09:14.591 --> 09:15.591
I'm not stopping
until she's crying.

09:15.592 --> 09:16.659
I ain't stopping.

09:16.660 --> 09:18.127
Here we go, Christina.

09:18.128 --> 09:19.362
Protein is...
I'm not real lucky.

09:19.363 --> 09:20.563
<i>Sorry about this.</i>

09:20.564 --> 09:22.432
<i>Wow, hanger steak.</i>

09:22.433 --> 09:23.566
Yams!

09:23.567 --> 09:25.768
Mmm. Eggplant.

09:25.769 --> 09:27.904
<i>Asparagus.
Asparagus.</i>

09:27.905 --> 09:29.205
<i>Delicious.
Sounds good.</i>

09:29.206 --> 09:31.841
Followed by...Crab.
Wow.

09:31.842 --> 09:33.276
Royce...
Happy with that?

09:33.277 --> 09:35.344
You think you could beat
Christina?

09:35.345 --> 09:36.412
Yes, chef.

09:36.413 --> 09:37.580
I ain't done with you yet!

09:37.581 --> 09:38.781
I ain't done with you!

09:38.782 --> 09:40.283
Let's go.
Next up...

09:40.284 --> 09:41.584
Barbie and Brian step forward

09:41.585 --> 09:43.786
to face
the one-armed bandit.

09:43.787 --> 09:45.054
Here we go.

09:45.055 --> 09:46.923
New York strip.
New York strip! Yes!

09:46.924 --> 09:49.292
<i>Nice. Celery root.
Celery root.</i>

09:49.293 --> 09:52.195
<i>Tomatoes.
Tomatoes.</i>

09:52.196 --> 09:54.764
<i>Cauliflower.
Cauliflower.</i>

09:54.765 --> 09:55.965
And shrimp.
Good job.

09:55.966 --> 09:57.567
<i>Nice.</i>

09:57.568 --> 09:59.802
Now it's time
for Tiffany and Justin

09:59.803 --> 10:01.270
to test their luck.

10:01.271 --> 10:03.840
I really don't have
much luck, honestly.

10:03.841 --> 10:05.608
If it wasn't for luck,
I wouldn't have any luck at all.

10:05.609 --> 10:07.977
We have got...
Filet.

10:07.978 --> 10:10.046
<i>Beets.
Beets.</i>

10:10.047 --> 10:12.381
Wow.
Carrots.

10:12.382 --> 10:15.051
<i>Zucchini.
And...</i>

10:15.052 --> 10:17.320
<i>Chorizo.
Chorizo.</i>

10:17.321 --> 10:19.589
There you go.
My luck sucks.

10:19.590 --> 10:21.824
carrots that are sweet,
beets that are sweet.

10:21.825 --> 10:24.093
Zucchini... that's just, like,
a boring vegetable.

10:24.094 --> 10:26.362
What the
am I gonna do with these?

10:26.363 --> 10:28.130
And finally, Robyn
and Clemenza are hoping

10:28.131 --> 10:31.000
their steak and ingredients
are the jackpot.

10:31.001 --> 10:33.169
You've got...
Rib eye.

10:33.170 --> 10:34.971
First ingredient comes up,
and it's rib eye.

10:34.972 --> 10:36.105
I'm, like, yes!

10:36.106 --> 10:37.874
Combined with parsnips.

10:37.875 --> 10:40.510
<i>Sweet corn.
Yeah.</i>

10:40.511 --> 10:42.211
All right, this is good.

10:42.212 --> 10:43.546
Now I'm waiting for, like,
the curveball to come in

10:43.547 --> 10:44.881
and be, like, blueberries.

10:44.882 --> 10:47.049
<i>Broccoli.
Broccoli is a little boring.</i>

10:47.050 --> 10:49.285
<i>Amazing.
Finally, bacon.</i>

10:49.286 --> 10:50.386
Well done.

10:50.387 --> 10:51.954
I'm, like, really?
Bacon.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.756
It's too good
to be true right now.

10:53.757 --> 10:56.225
Clemenza, happy with that?
Very happy.

10:56.226 --> 10:58.160
I would bathe myself in bacon
if I could.

10:58.161 --> 11:00.763
Kimmie, while you did not
get a chance

11:00.764 --> 11:02.965
to pull the slot machine,
you will be cooking.

11:02.966 --> 11:06.569
You need to decide
which of your teammates

11:06.570 --> 11:08.070
you want to go up against.

11:08.071 --> 11:09.872
Who would you like
to cook alongside?

11:09.873 --> 11:12.542
Your team will taste
both of those dishes

11:12.543 --> 11:15.711
<i>and decide which one
out of both your dishes</i>

11:15.712 --> 11:17.680
will go up against
the blue team. Got it?

11:17.681 --> 11:19.515
<i>Yes, chef.
So, Kimmie...</i>

11:19.516 --> 11:21.651
Hurry up.
Robyn.

11:21.652 --> 11:22.919
Tiffany has... oh.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.987
Like, what the !

11:24.988 --> 11:27.623
So it's either your dish
or my dish that goes up there.

11:27.624 --> 11:30.092
She could have chose anyone,
but she chooses her best friend.

11:30.093 --> 11:32.028
Now we have to go
head to head against each other.

11:32.029 --> 11:34.897
Whatever, dude.
What the ever.

11:34.898 --> 11:37.500
So you're gonna do
a rib eye. Why?

11:37.501 --> 11:39.335
I feel comfortable
with rib eye, chef.

11:39.336 --> 11:40.836
Easy as pie, man.
Easy as pie.

11:40.837 --> 11:43.506
I know Robyn's my girl,
but I'm from the South.

11:43.507 --> 11:45.207
That's what we eat
all the time.

11:45.208 --> 11:47.577
30 minutes to cook
an amazing steak.

11:47.578 --> 11:49.111
Your time starts now.
Good luck.

11:49.112 --> 11:50.880
Go, go, go, go.
Go, go, go.

11:50.881 --> 11:52.982
After trying to
get lucky with ingredients,

11:52.983 --> 11:54.850
the chefs must get creative

11:54.851 --> 11:57.420
with designing
their steak dishes.

11:57.421 --> 11:59.622
Let's go. Pans on.
Start searing.

11:59.623 --> 12:02.091
Each chef will have 30
minutes to complete their dish.

12:02.092 --> 12:03.993
Are you good
with hanger steak, dude?

12:03.994 --> 12:05.861
Yeah. I mean,
I've cooked it before.

12:05.862 --> 12:09.198
I just... never with crab,
eggplant, asparagus.

12:09.199 --> 12:11.033
If I had to choose
my own ingredients,

12:11.034 --> 12:12.501
definitely not
what I would have chosen.

12:12.502 --> 12:14.070
Eggplant? Are you serious?

12:14.071 --> 12:15.671
You know how to cook, right?

12:15.672 --> 12:16.772
You know what the
you're doing.

12:16.773 --> 12:18.174
Asparagus, crab meat.

12:18.175 --> 12:20.376
Like, what the
am I gonna do with 'em?

12:20.377 --> 12:22.378
All right, come on, now.

12:22.379 --> 12:24.413
Hot pan in the back is mine.
Small one.

12:24.414 --> 12:26.616
I'm feeling great.
I'm gonna beat this girl.

12:26.617 --> 12:28.718
I'm bringing "A" game.
"A" game.

12:28.719 --> 12:31.621
Bring the phone.
Call my mama.

12:31.622 --> 12:33.356
She'll tell ya ain't none
of you

12:33.357 --> 12:35.157
can cook like me!

12:35.158 --> 12:36.859
20 minutes to go. Come on.

12:36.860 --> 12:38.561
Yes, chef.
Make it count.

12:38.562 --> 12:40.663
Make sure that
convection gets going hot.

12:40.664 --> 12:42.264
Those ingredients,
they're tough ingredients

12:42.265 --> 12:43.699
to incorporate together,

12:43.700 --> 12:45.034
and I really had no idea
what I was doing.

12:45.035 --> 12:46.369
I was just going
with my emotion.

12:46.370 --> 12:48.137
Put it all the way up.
Now's my time

12:48.138 --> 12:49.872
to show chef Ramsay
what I'm made of.

12:49.873 --> 12:51.107
Man, you don't want
to up steaks

12:51.108 --> 12:52.174
when the man's
opening a steak house.

12:52.175 --> 12:55.811
Salt. Salt.
Go right there.

12:55.812 --> 12:57.913
I have no clue
what parsnips are at all,

12:57.914 --> 13:01.150
so I'm just gonna go and,
you know, fry them bad boys.

13:01.151 --> 13:03.653
When in doubt, you fry .

13:03.654 --> 13:05.721
I definitely fried
the bacon as well.

13:05.722 --> 13:08.290
That's the Southern way, man.
It always tastes good.

13:08.291 --> 13:13.229
I'm gonna fry this .
Yeah!

13:13.230 --> 13:14.497
15 minutes gone.

13:14.498 --> 13:16.365
15 minutes to go.
Come on.

13:16.366 --> 13:18.601
Behind, behind, behind.
Coming through. Coming through.

13:18.602 --> 13:19.802
I'm already thinking
what I gotta do against Dana

13:19.803 --> 13:21.704
and outshine her.

13:21.705 --> 13:24.340
The issue that I'm having
is that we have this set

13:24.341 --> 13:26.475
of great, traditional
steak house ingredients.

13:26.476 --> 13:29.545
But the reality is
how do you twist these now

13:29.546 --> 13:31.480
to make it imaginative
and creative?

13:31.481 --> 13:33.349
So what's going through
my head is

13:33.350 --> 13:36.085
season, season, season.

13:36.086 --> 13:38.721
On your back.
Heard on my back.

13:38.722 --> 13:40.623
Kimmie wants to go
up against my dish, that's fine.

13:40.624 --> 13:42.925
I could cook circles
around her.

13:42.926 --> 13:45.227
Bitch, I got this .

13:45.228 --> 13:46.896
Last ten minutes, guys.

13:46.897 --> 13:49.665
I got the rib eye. I got
the thickest cut of meat.

13:49.666 --> 13:51.801
I know I'm gonna be
the last one to plate.

13:51.802 --> 13:54.704
But I also know my timing
is gonna be to perfection.

13:54.705 --> 13:56.172
Make sure you get
your meats on, guys.

13:56.173 --> 13:56.939
Pretty fast for a fat guy.

13:56.940 --> 13:59.475
Now we're talking.

13:59.476 --> 14:01.610
Filet, that's me.

14:01.611 --> 14:03.879
I'm happy that I get a filet,
but at the same time,

14:03.880 --> 14:05.881
I get stuck with, like,
the worst list of ingredients.

14:05.882 --> 14:07.917
Is anyone else gonna
need the blender?

14:07.918 --> 14:09.685
I will need a blender too.

14:09.686 --> 14:11.654
I've decided that I'm gonna make
a stuffing, you know?

14:11.655 --> 14:13.589
I'm gonna do something
completely crazy

14:13.590 --> 14:16.625
that I've never done before,
but I think it's gonna work.

14:16.626 --> 14:18.260
<i>One and a half minutes
to go.</i>

14:18.261 --> 14:20.162
<i>Start plating.
How long?</i>

14:20.163 --> 14:22.665
90 seconds. We gotta be in
that window soon. .

14:22.666 --> 14:25.067
I'm watching Clemenza,
and he's moving way too slow.

14:25.068 --> 14:27.336
There's nothing you can do at
that point... it's raw? It's raw.

14:27.337 --> 14:29.438
Whatever you have to do,
just get it done right now.

14:29.439 --> 14:31.373
Get plated.
Now I'm incredibly nervous.

14:31.374 --> 14:33.142
It's coming down to the wire.

14:33.143 --> 14:34.977
I got the steak off,
and I'm, like, "damn it!"

14:34.978 --> 14:36.345
The rib eye may be undercooked,

14:36.346 --> 14:37.847
and I don't got time to fix it.

14:37.848 --> 14:40.683
20 seconds to go!
Ugh!

14:40.684 --> 14:42.451
I'm running out of time, man.
Here we go!

14:42.452 --> 14:47.056
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

14:47.057 --> 14:50.159
<i>six, five, four,</i>

14:50.160 --> 14:53.763
three, two, one.

14:53.764 --> 14:56.232
And serve!

14:58.598 --> 15:00.966
It's the final
moments of the cooking part

15:00.967 --> 15:03.368
of the "High-Steaks" challenge...
Coming down.

15:03.369 --> 15:06.104
And both teams are
racing to plate steak dishes

15:06.105 --> 15:08.740
randomly assigned to them by the
Hell's Kitchen slot machine.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.243
Ten, nine, eight...

15:11.244 --> 15:14.479
But one chef is
cutting it a little close.

15:14.480 --> 15:19.084
Three, two, one, and serve!

15:19.085 --> 15:23.121
Clemenza, let's go.
That's it.

15:23.122 --> 15:25.123
I don't know what's going on
with the steak,

15:25.124 --> 15:26.625
but at least I got it done.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.593
Now I'm just hoping
for the best.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.929
With the cooking over,
the red team must now decide

15:30.930 --> 15:33.699
whose rib eye dish will go up
against the blue team.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.534
<i>Red team, you've got
one minute.</i>

15:35.535 --> 15:38.003
Start deciding...
Robyn or Kimmie?

15:38.004 --> 15:40.238
Whose is whose?
This is Robyn's, this is mine.

15:40.239 --> 15:42.474
Mine's, um, Jack... we can eat this?
We can eat this?

15:42.475 --> 15:45.043
I start trying to talk
about, you know, my sauces,

15:45.044 --> 15:47.012
and they're talking over me.

15:47.013 --> 15:49.014
Cajun spices, and in the corner...
Do you have extra sauce?

15:49.015 --> 15:50.649
Make your decision, please.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.051
Mine's a coffee and eggs,
coffee-encrusted.

15:53.052 --> 15:54.252
Make your decision!

15:54.253 --> 15:55.554
I go with Robyn.
Yeah.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.089
This sauce. This sauce.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.323
Robyn's.

15:58.324 --> 16:00.792
I know their mind was
made up before.

16:00.793 --> 16:04.629
I'm so mad because I worked
my ass off on this steak.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.031
Kimmie, what's the matter?

16:06.032 --> 16:07.566
I'm good.
Okay, let's go.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.401
The girls decided
to go with my dish,

16:09.402 --> 16:10.702
and then here goes
Kimmie crying.

16:10.703 --> 16:14.406
Sometimes I feel like
I'm dealing with a child.

16:16.375 --> 16:19.077
<i>Listen carefully.
The winner of Hell's Kitchen</i>

16:19.078 --> 16:22.247
will become the head chef at
Gordon Ramsay's Steak in Vegas.

16:22.248 --> 16:24.316
So this challenge,
for me, is critical.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.518
Let's start off with the battle
of the filet... let's go.

16:26.519 --> 16:29.387
First up, Tiffany
and Justin will go head to head

16:29.388 --> 16:32.691
with their filet dishes,
which also include beets,

16:32.692 --> 16:35.160
carrots, zucchini, and chorizo.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.162
<i>Chef, what I
did for you today is</i>

16:37.163 --> 16:39.431
<i>a truffle-smashed beets,
glazed carrots,</i>

16:39.432 --> 16:42.367
chorizo cream sauce,
and a chorizo zucchini cake.

16:42.368 --> 16:44.803
I'm nervous as hell.
They were tough ingredients

16:44.804 --> 16:46.338
to incorporate together.

16:46.339 --> 16:49.441
And I hope chef Ramsay likes
my creativity.

16:49.442 --> 16:52.010
Wow, that's delicious.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.312
<i>Thank you, chef.
I mean, really delicious.</i>

16:54.313 --> 16:56.381
I can taste the smokiness
of the chorizo coming through.

16:56.382 --> 16:58.183
The beets are delicious.
My biggest problem,

16:58.184 --> 16:59.918
I want to eat more.
Thank you.

16:59.919 --> 17:01.765
<i>Great job, indeed.
Thank you very much.</i>

17:01.766 --> 17:03.513
Tiffany.

17:03.514 --> 17:06.724
I have a chorizo-zucchini
stuffing in the filet.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.359
You stuffed the filet?
I stuffed the filet.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.728
<i>Wow. Dangerous.
Yes.</i>

17:09.729 --> 17:11.163
Very dangerous. I mean,

17:11.164 --> 17:12.631
the filet is the Rolls Royce
of cuts.

17:12.632 --> 17:17.702
You stuffed a filet?
Are you kidding me?

17:17.703 --> 17:20.372
It tastes good.
It tastes very good.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.773
<i>Thank you.
The issue is...</i>

17:22.775 --> 17:25.010
When you stuff a filet,
it's always so hard.

17:25.011 --> 17:27.378
I mean, really hard to nail,
because the temperature goes.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.448
It overcooks in seconds.

17:30.449 --> 17:32.117
Congratulations, blue team.

17:32.118 --> 17:34.419
Justin, that's the best dish
I've tasted so far.

17:34.420 --> 17:35.987
<i>Thank you, chef.
Really good.</i>

17:35.988 --> 17:36.755
Thank you, chef.
Really good, indeed.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.824
Thank you very much.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.525
You hear something like that
from a chef that's

17:40.526 --> 17:41.626
at the caliber of chef Ramsay,

17:41.627 --> 17:43.094
it's just... it's unbelievable.

17:43.095 --> 17:44.729
It feels good, man.
It really does feel good.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.631
Next up, hanger steak.
Let's go.

17:46.632 --> 17:48.066
Yes, chef.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.569
Me and Royce had just
gone up against each other

17:50.570 --> 17:53.538
with the lobster challenge,
so it's kind of a rematch.

17:53.539 --> 17:55.473
I know he's definitely looking
for redemption,

17:55.474 --> 17:57.342
and I'm...
I'm ready for it.

17:57.343 --> 17:59.611
Christina.
Chef, we have a hanger steak.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.913
I have it marinated
in lime juice,

18:01.914 --> 18:03.481
red pepper flakes.

18:03.482 --> 18:06.451
I have a panko-parmesan crusted
and pan-fried eggplant

18:06.452 --> 18:08.119
<i>wrapped around
grilled asparagus.</i>

18:08.120 --> 18:10.488
It's delicious.
Really good, indeed.

18:10.489 --> 18:12.123
Steak nailed perfectly.

18:12.124 --> 18:14.059
Thank you.
Love the crispiness of the eggplant.

18:14.060 --> 18:16.228
Not again!

18:16.229 --> 18:18.129
The big issue is this.

18:18.130 --> 18:21.600
You put yam on a plate, you need
to give it some help. Yeah.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.202
Big time.
You're right, chef.

18:24.203 --> 18:25.804
It's a clump of dull mess. Yeah.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.205
And it's such a shame because

18:27.206 --> 18:29.241
everything else on the plate
you've nailed.

18:32.144 --> 18:34.145
Royce.
I work in a steak house.

18:34.146 --> 18:35.547
I know how to cook steak.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.849
This is Royce.
This is what I do.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.918
I pan-seared the crab cake

18:39.919 --> 18:41.653
<i>along with a port wine
beurre blanc.</i>

18:41.654 --> 18:44.756
<i>I have a demi-glace
with the steak.</i>

18:44.757 --> 18:46.625
I have fresh-grilled
vegetables, squeezes of lemon,

18:46.626 --> 18:48.793
<i>and served medium-rare.</i>

18:50.496 --> 18:52.264
It looks fantastic.

18:52.265 --> 18:55.000
<i>It's got finesse.</i>

18:55.001 --> 18:57.636
I wasn't inspired with this.
It was undercooked.

18:59.138 --> 19:03.041
It's spongy, and it's...

19:03.042 --> 19:05.710
Oh, . Ehh! Damn.

19:05.711 --> 19:09.414
What a shame.
I know that I under-seasoned my yams,

19:09.415 --> 19:11.683
but I also know that
chef Ramsay didn't, you know,

19:11.684 --> 19:13.551
discard them from his mouth.

19:13.552 --> 19:16.855
Such a shame, 'cause
everything else you've nailed.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.790
I've got an issue with the yams
on Christina's plate,

19:18.791 --> 19:21.593
and an issue
with your eggplant.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.898
I mean, come on!
Congratulations...

19:26.899 --> 19:30.702
Come on! Come on!

19:30.703 --> 19:33.171
To the red team.
Thank you, chef.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.907
Come on!
It's like, aw, man...

19:35.908 --> 19:37.809
That's two times.
Two challenges in a row.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.378
Poor Royce.
I feel really bad for him.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.950
Okay, next one is the battle of
the flat iron steak. Let's go.

19:44.951 --> 19:47.786
With the score tied,
it's time for Dana and Patrick

19:47.787 --> 19:49.621
to show what they were
able to do

19:49.622 --> 19:52.924
with flat iron steak,
potatoes, mushrooms,

19:52.925 --> 19:54.726
spinach, and blue cheese.

19:54.727 --> 19:57.495
Dana.
I grilled the flat iron steak,

19:57.496 --> 19:59.230
<i>some sauteed spinach.</i>

19:59.231 --> 20:02.033
The sauce on top is
a cabernet reduction

20:02.034 --> 20:03.401
<i>with wild mushrooms.</i>

20:03.402 --> 20:05.437
It looks a mess.

20:05.438 --> 20:08.340
I'm not going to eat food that's
been sat in a swimming pool.

20:08.341 --> 20:11.476
Oh, God, help.
This isn't a good start.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.678
I'm just hoping that
the flavor's there,

20:13.679 --> 20:17.816
the taste is there, and that
he'll get over the presentation.

20:17.817 --> 20:20.785
The meat's ragged,
overcooked and it's dry.

20:20.786 --> 20:24.089
That's your worst
performing dish so far.

20:24.090 --> 20:25.957
Patrick, talk to me.
What is that?

20:25.958 --> 20:28.493
I have a seared
flat iron steak, chef,

20:28.494 --> 20:31.563
<i>with a roasted wild mushroom
and red potato hash</i>

20:31.564 --> 20:34.366
and a blue cheese cream sauce.
Mm-hmm.

20:36.302 --> 20:39.070
Taste.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.605
So salty.

20:40.606 --> 20:44.943
It's like you just clumped
a big lump of salt in there.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.778
You've got blue cheese,
which is naturally

20:46.779 --> 20:47.779
gonna salt things anyway.
Yes. Yes.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.748
So it's just...
Ill-conceived.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.683
Both of you, no points.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.585
I mean, bitterly disappointed!

20:55.221 --> 20:56.988
After poor
performances from both teams,

20:56.989 --> 20:58.556
the score remains tied.

20:58.557 --> 21:01.359
Chef kicked the living crap
right out of me.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.661
My wife's gonna tell me,
"you always salt too much!"

21:03.662 --> 21:06.264
So I'm sure that's gonna be
a fun one at home.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.933
Now, Barbie
and Brian are each hoping

21:08.934 --> 21:10.902
their New York strip
with celery root,

21:10.903 --> 21:13.505
tomatoes, cauliflower,
and shrimp

21:13.506 --> 21:15.273
will give their team the lead.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.542
This is my point...
If Barbie beats me,

21:17.543 --> 21:21.079
I will slam my head
into the first hard,

21:21.080 --> 21:22.947
blunt object I can find.

21:22.948 --> 21:24.549
Okay, Barbie.

21:24.550 --> 21:26.418
I have a grilled
New York strip surf & turf

21:26.419 --> 21:29.621
with a celery root mash,
roasted cauliflower,

21:29.622 --> 21:32.924
a little salad
of heirloom tomatoes.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.959
The New York steak's delicious.
Thank you, chef.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.195
<i>Shrimp are cooked perfectly.</i>

21:37.196 --> 21:38.196
Ow.

21:38.197 --> 21:39.964
<i>Brian.
Hello, chef.</i>

21:39.965 --> 21:42.867
What I have for you today
is a New York strip tagliatta.

21:42.868 --> 21:45.336
<i>It's Rosemary
and Dijon crusted.</i>

21:45.337 --> 21:47.906
On top is a little bit
of celery root frite.

21:47.907 --> 21:51.176
<i>On the side is a little bit
of a warm salad.</i>

21:51.177 --> 21:55.380
It's some of the heirloom
tomatoes mixed with shrimp.

21:55.381 --> 21:57.082
Temperature's nailed perfectly.

21:57.083 --> 22:01.252
Cauliflower, shrimp
works brilliantly.

22:01.253 --> 22:04.422
Tough one.

22:04.423 --> 22:07.025
Congratulations
to the red team.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.260
<i>Yes!</i>

22:09.261 --> 22:11.830
Wait. And the blue team.
Good job.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.264
<i>Really good job.
Thank you, chef.</i>

22:13.265 --> 22:14.299
Really good job, indeed.

22:14.300 --> 22:15.900
Thank God.

22:15.901 --> 22:18.570
Thank you,
whatever is up there.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.038
<i>Gracias, San Pedro.</i>

22:20.039 --> 22:22.073
With the score tied at two

22:22.074 --> 22:23.842
going into the final round,

22:23.843 --> 22:26.411
it all comes down
to Robyn and Clemenza.

22:26.412 --> 22:28.413
Battle of the rib eye.
Let's go.

22:28.414 --> 22:29.848
Come on, Clemenza!

22:29.849 --> 22:32.150
It comes down
to the tie breaker now.

22:32.151 --> 22:34.119
I am a little nervous
at this point.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.554
I didn't really have
enough time to finish that dish.

22:36.555 --> 22:38.723
<i>Clemenza, what is that?
Pan-seared rib eye</i>

22:38.724 --> 22:41.426
<i>with a glazed
charred-corn relish</i>

22:41.427 --> 22:44.596
with a little bit of bacon
and some fried parsnip.

22:44.597 --> 22:48.533
I'm just gonna pray that
I didn't undercook my rib eye.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.969
The steak...
Slightly undercooked.

22:52.000 --> 22:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

23:06.662 --> 23:09.431
The "High-Steaks"
challenge is tied at two,

23:09.432 --> 23:11.399
and Clemenza is hoping
his pan-seared rib eye

23:11.400 --> 23:13.001
will come out on top.

23:13.002 --> 23:17.072
We're tied. We need Clemenza
to get the point.

23:17.073 --> 23:19.744
The steak...
Slightly undercooked.

23:22.011 --> 23:25.113
We need Clemenza's point.

23:25.114 --> 23:27.882
It's delicious.
Thank you, chef.

23:27.883 --> 23:29.484
<i>Absolutely delicious.</i>

23:29.485 --> 23:31.319
The steak is missing
two minutes in the oven,

23:31.320 --> 23:34.189
however, you've done it justice.
Thank you, chef.

23:34.190 --> 23:35.790
Right, Robyn,
what is it, please?

23:35.791 --> 23:37.092
Coffee and flour-encrusted
rib eye

23:37.093 --> 23:39.794
<i>with bacon, corn, and broccoli.</i>

23:39.795 --> 23:41.463
I'm up here instead of Kimmie.

23:41.464 --> 23:43.498
That's a lot of pressure
right now.

23:43.499 --> 23:45.433
I'm hoping that my dish is gonna
win, but Clemenza's dish

23:45.434 --> 23:46.835
definitely looks good.

23:46.836 --> 23:48.169
The frittata's
seasoned beautifully.

23:48.170 --> 23:49.904
Thank you, chef.

23:49.905 --> 23:52.407
Damn, the bad news is
it's overcooked.

23:55.911 --> 23:58.780
Um, the rub is disgusting,
it's wet, it's soggy,

23:58.781 --> 24:00.815
and it's overcooked.

24:00.816 --> 24:03.618
Dreadful!
Congratulations, blue team.

24:03.619 --> 24:06.988
Men win.

24:06.989 --> 24:08.857
Damn it, man, I hate to say it,
but yeah, I'm...

24:08.858 --> 24:13.294
I'm the
mack daddy, baby.

24:13.295 --> 24:15.363
I'm feeling like
that we didn't get the point,

24:15.364 --> 24:16.898
and I feel Kimmie
right next to me,

24:16.899 --> 24:18.533
and of course she was crying.

24:18.534 --> 24:20.235
I didn't make the decision.

24:20.236 --> 24:21.836
Your teammates made
the decision... get over it.

24:21.837 --> 24:24.105
Just to confirm in my mind
what went on there,

24:24.106 --> 24:25.540
Kimmie, I want to taste
your dish.

24:25.541 --> 24:28.043
<i>Bring it up. Let's go.</i>

24:28.044 --> 24:30.011
But since the
crybaby's crying,

24:30.012 --> 24:31.513
let the crybaby
put her steak up there.

24:36.185 --> 24:37.886
It is... it is delicious.

24:37.887 --> 24:40.488
<i>It's almost like a sort
of barbecued short rib.</i>

24:40.489 --> 24:42.724
I knew exactly what
chef Ramsay was going to say.

24:42.725 --> 24:44.592
I knew he was totally gonna say
her dish was the best.

24:44.593 --> 24:46.227
I knew it.

24:46.228 --> 24:47.896
All of you, come up here
and take a taste of that meat.

24:47.897 --> 24:49.097
Come around here, please.

24:49.098 --> 24:51.199
Yes, chef.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.501
Just take a lump of meat.
I've cut it up for you.

24:53.502 --> 24:55.737
<i>Thank you, chef.
It's really great flavor.</i>

24:55.738 --> 24:57.772
It's good.
Okay, it tastes good.

24:57.773 --> 25:00.475
But it looks like a
pile of on a plate.

25:00.476 --> 25:03.311
Ladies, I am sorry, but I don't
know where you're coming from

25:03.312 --> 25:06.081
because that is delicious.
Wrong choice.

25:06.082 --> 25:09.217
I feel so much redemption
right now, you have no idea.

25:09.218 --> 25:12.187
That proves to my team
that I know how to cook steaks.

25:12.188 --> 25:15.190
<i>I do this for a living, people.</i>

25:15.191 --> 25:17.559
<i>Bad choice, ladies.
Yeah, you're right, chef.</i>

25:17.560 --> 25:19.127
Because that would have given
Clemenza a run for his money,

25:19.128 --> 25:21.362
<i>let me tell you.</i>

25:21.363 --> 25:23.965
Blue team, congratulations.
Thank you, chef.

25:23.966 --> 25:27.335
You've got a unique day.
To start off with,

25:27.336 --> 25:29.904
you'll be going shopping
at one of my favorite hangouts,

25:29.905 --> 25:31.973
Sur La Table.

25:31.974 --> 25:35.076
Blue team with another win,
and we go get to go shopping

25:35.077 --> 25:37.679
<i>for knives and ...
whaaaat?</i>

25:37.680 --> 25:39.714
<i>But there's more.</i>

25:39.715 --> 25:41.282
You're going to one of the best
restaurants in California...

25:41.283 --> 25:43.618
<i>Comme Ca.
Yes!</i>

25:43.619 --> 25:45.487
Chef David Myers has prepared

25:45.488 --> 25:48.022
the most amazing lunch
for you all.

25:48.023 --> 25:49.858
I'm stoked. We're gonna eat,
we're gonna shop.

25:49.859 --> 25:51.392
It's like a chef's dream.

25:51.393 --> 25:53.128
Blue team, good job.
Well done, Justin.

25:53.129 --> 25:56.798
Now, piss off. Good job.
Thank you, chef.

25:56.799 --> 26:00.502
Red team, tomorrow,
in Hell's Kitchen,

26:00.503 --> 26:02.837
it's steak night!

26:02.838 --> 26:04.773
<i>You've got a very busy day
ahead of you.</i>

26:04.774 --> 26:06.241
I have a special delivery.

26:06.242 --> 26:08.943
There's a side of beef
arriving.

26:08.944 --> 26:12.380
<i>.
So when the beef arrives,</i>

26:12.381 --> 26:14.282
unload the truck,
bring in the carcass,

26:14.283 --> 26:15.817
<i>and get it prepped</i>

26:15.818 --> 26:17.385
<i>ahead of tomorrow night's
dinner service.</i>

26:17.386 --> 26:18.920
Got it?
Yes, chef.

26:18.921 --> 26:20.421
I'm super pissed off because

26:20.422 --> 26:22.323
my dish would have won
that .

26:22.324 --> 26:25.593
And I just know it's gonna be
a long day ahead of us.

26:27.229 --> 26:28.630
Come on, let's go.

26:30.599 --> 26:32.433
Today! Let's go!

26:36.438 --> 26:39.040
Holy .

26:39.041 --> 26:40.675
<i>Rrrrrrr!</i>

26:40.676 --> 26:42.443
Wow, that's one big half
of a cow.

26:42.444 --> 26:45.046
This is a big piece
of meat.

26:45.047 --> 26:48.449
You're kidding me.
Like, it's huge, man.

26:48.450 --> 26:50.819
Like, me and Clemenza could have
laid down next to each other

26:50.820 --> 26:52.687
and still not have been
as big as this cow.

26:52.688 --> 26:56.391
One, two, three.
Unh!

26:56.392 --> 26:58.293
me, dude.

26:58.294 --> 27:01.596
This is ridiculous. Like,
this is definitely a punishment

27:01.597 --> 27:03.932
that the boys should be having

27:03.933 --> 27:05.900
because how the
are we gonna carry this?

27:05.901 --> 27:08.369
me!

27:08.370 --> 27:12.106
Ah... Holy !

27:12.107 --> 27:15.043
Look at this! Holy crap!

27:15.044 --> 27:17.512
That's a dead animal.
Look at the size of that.

27:17.513 --> 27:19.981
I see six chicks trying
to pick up a half a cow.

27:19.982 --> 27:21.850
It's kind of funny, actually.

27:21.851 --> 27:23.351
'Cause we've been getting
our asses handed to us,

27:23.352 --> 27:24.953
and we've been getting
a little abuse,

27:24.954 --> 27:27.388
so uh, let them bring in
the beef.

27:27.389 --> 27:28.990
<i>Dude, you see the
size of that thing?</i>

27:28.991 --> 27:30.091
<i>You're kidding me.</i>

27:30.092 --> 27:32.026
Can we get a forklift?

27:32.027 --> 27:35.930
<i>The boys get to go on
an amazing shopping spree again.</i>

27:35.931 --> 27:38.433
Oh, I'm pissed off as all hell.
It's just not fair.

27:38.434 --> 27:40.168
It's not fair!

27:41.937 --> 27:44.839
Holy... Do you need
more help in that back?

27:44.840 --> 27:46.040
Yes.

27:46.041 --> 27:47.609
I feel like I got 250 pounds

27:47.610 --> 27:49.978
back on this ass end
of this cow.

27:49.979 --> 27:52.513
I mean, it's just like
I can't barely breathe.

27:55.351 --> 28:01.222
Kimmie's, like...

28:01.223 --> 28:03.458
Is she gonna make it?
Like, is she gonna be all right?

28:03.459 --> 28:06.327
One, two, three!

28:07.763 --> 28:09.864
Okay, that was fun.

28:09.865 --> 28:11.566
While the women are
ready to do some chopping...

28:11.567 --> 28:13.468
We're going to Sur La Table?

28:13.469 --> 28:14.903
The men are
ready to do some shopping.

28:14.904 --> 28:17.505
Sur La Table!
Can't wait.

28:18.774 --> 28:20.208
I think I'm gonna get
an espresso maker.

28:20.209 --> 28:21.776
I don't know.

28:21.777 --> 28:24.545
Sur La Table is basically
Disneyland for chefs.

28:24.546 --> 28:26.314
How 'bout that, right?
It's gorgeous.

28:26.315 --> 28:28.283
I want that 7-inch
Santoku right there.

28:28.284 --> 28:30.018
Oh, what about
an ice cream maker?

28:30.019 --> 28:32.954
I'll get an ice cream maker.
Done! Yes!

28:32.955 --> 28:35.390
I'm like a kid in a candy store.
My eyes are lit up,

28:35.391 --> 28:37.525
and I'm just beaming off
of 50 million things I see

28:37.526 --> 28:39.360
and I already want.
I'm loving it.

28:39.361 --> 28:41.796
Clemenza bought
half the store today.

28:41.797 --> 28:44.399
I think he bought
a soda machine, a juicer,

28:44.400 --> 28:46.734
a peeler...
He was just going nuts.

28:46.735 --> 28:48.503
He made sure he spent
every penny.

28:48.504 --> 28:51.706
Don't forget
the little piece of candy.

28:51.707 --> 28:54.075
Yeah, baby!

28:54.076 --> 28:59.047
While the men enjoy the
spoils of victory, the women...

28:59.048 --> 29:01.950
I'm so pissed.
We were this close.

29:01.951 --> 29:04.218
Deal with the
agony of butchering the meat.

29:04.219 --> 29:06.220
I should have felt the steaks.

29:06.221 --> 29:08.156
Even though I couldn't taste
them, I could have felt them.

29:08.157 --> 29:10.692
To lose the steak challenge,
it's incredibly disappointing.

29:10.693 --> 29:14.028
Honestly,
it's Robyn's fault we lost.

29:14.029 --> 29:16.264
Dude, next time you definitely
gotta sell your .

29:16.265 --> 29:18.766
I was trying. Robyn just
kept talking over me.

29:18.767 --> 29:20.768
I feel like
I'm constantly getting

29:20.769 --> 29:22.470
dirty looks behind my back
because they don't have enough

29:22.471 --> 29:25.640
to do it to my face.

29:25.641 --> 29:27.542
There's no team
in the red team.

29:27.543 --> 29:29.544
It's let's all turn
against each other now.

29:35.117 --> 29:37.785
<i>Yeah!
Let's go!</i>

29:37.786 --> 29:39.620
Nice lunch.
I cannot wait to eat.

29:39.621 --> 29:42.857
Chefs, welcome.
Great to have you.

29:42.858 --> 29:44.826
We're thrilled. We have
a really special meal

29:44.827 --> 29:48.129
planned for you today.
Thank you very much.

29:48.130 --> 29:50.298
I'm stoked.
We get to get out.

29:50.299 --> 29:51.833
We get to sit down as a team,

29:51.834 --> 29:53.534
relax again, have a nice lunch.

29:53.535 --> 29:57.372
We deserve it.

29:57.373 --> 29:59.607
Oh, my God. Animal.

30:03.178 --> 30:06.547
You can bring your taser back.
It's okay.

30:06.548 --> 30:07.949
The guys are guys.
They're young.

30:07.950 --> 30:10.251
Excuse me.

30:10.252 --> 30:12.186
You know, I'm older,
and I'm kind of acting

30:12.187 --> 30:14.389
as a little bit more
of the father figure.

30:14.390 --> 30:16.324
<i>What's the matter with you?
Wow.</i>

30:16.325 --> 30:17.191
I said excuse me.
It was an accident.

30:17.192 --> 30:19.127
I had a reflex.
Listen, young man,

30:19.128 --> 30:20.495
we will leave here right now...

30:20.496 --> 30:21.629
we will leave here right now!

30:21.630 --> 30:23.598
Take that to go!

30:23.599 --> 30:26.134
You know, it's cool.
It's good to laugh a little bit

30:26.135 --> 30:28.002
outside of the pressure
and the stress

30:28.003 --> 30:29.404
<i>that is Hell's Kitchen.</i>

30:29.405 --> 30:31.205
You guys can never
keep it clean.

30:31.206 --> 30:32.573
No. No.
We could try it.

30:32.574 --> 30:34.308
Blue team's kinda bonding.

30:34.309 --> 30:35.910
Everything's good right now.

30:35.911 --> 30:37.378
We're having some fun.
We're loosening up.

30:37.379 --> 30:39.313
We let ourselves relax
for once,

30:39.314 --> 30:41.449
and it was
a really good feeling.

30:41.450 --> 30:42.717
<i>Salud!</i>

30:42.718 --> 30:44.786
Chin-chin.
Chin-chin...

30:44.787 --> 30:46.721
While the good times
are rolling for the men's team,

30:46.722 --> 30:48.156
in the red kitchen...

30:48.157 --> 30:50.591
Barbie, I think
took my knife kit.

30:50.592 --> 30:53.628
Accusations are flying.

30:53.629 --> 30:55.196
If we're gonna use
other people's knives kits,

30:55.197 --> 30:56.297
we gotta respect it.

30:56.298 --> 30:58.099
Mine gets used
all the time.

30:58.100 --> 30:59.700
I have the only dull
chef's knife in here.

30:59.701 --> 31:01.736
I'm just saying we gotta respect
each other's knife kits.

31:01.737 --> 31:03.438
It's just how you
say it, Robyn.

31:03.439 --> 31:05.106
You say it with aggression,
and you...

31:05.107 --> 31:06.707
well, you know what,
I don't change the way

31:06.708 --> 31:08.209
you speak, Kimmie, so I'm not
gonna change the way I speak.

31:08.210 --> 31:09.977
Robyn's got this attitude
today.

31:09.978 --> 31:11.512
She feels like
because I outshined her

31:11.513 --> 31:12.880
on the rib eye today.

31:12.881 --> 31:14.649
I totally outshined that bitch,

31:14.650 --> 31:16.551
and she's totally jealous,
that's all that it's about.

31:16.552 --> 31:18.486
I'm not gonna talk to anybody
unless I need to.

31:18.487 --> 31:20.521
That's kinda bitchy.

31:20.522 --> 31:22.590
Kimmie thinks she can
talk to anyone

31:22.591 --> 31:26.327
the way she is because
she's 350 and 6'2".

31:26.328 --> 31:27.795
It's not gonna work.

31:27.796 --> 31:29.464
<i>Kimmie, I don't think
I'm bitchy at all.</i>

31:29.465 --> 31:31.065
Everyone's giving dirty looks.

31:31.066 --> 31:33.434
Which means you're
in that as well.

31:33.435 --> 31:35.803
I just said everybody.

31:35.804 --> 31:38.005
Oh, my God, Robyn, I'm not
in the mood today, dude.

31:38.006 --> 31:39.874
<i>I'm so not in the mood.</i>

31:39.875 --> 31:42.210
I'm totally getting close to
bitch slapping this girl today.

31:42.211 --> 31:44.679
Just quit talking,
or it's gonna get ugly.

31:44.680 --> 31:46.481
I don't think I need
to be by her right now

31:46.482 --> 31:48.182
because she's really
pissing me off.

31:48.183 --> 31:49.383
Kimmie, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

31:49.384 --> 31:51.385
Robyn, just stop talking.

31:51.386 --> 31:53.788
I don't have to
stop talking, Kimmie.

31:53.789 --> 31:55.990
This is gonna get ugly.
Unh!

31:55.991 --> 31:58.526
<i>Kimmie!</i>

32:01.841 --> 32:04.309
After losing the
"High-Steaks" challenge,

32:04.310 --> 32:07.646
the red team is faced with
a grueling day of punishment.

32:07.647 --> 32:10.815
And everyone's patience
with Robyn is wearing thin.

32:10.816 --> 32:12.450
Everyone's giving dirty looks.

32:12.451 --> 32:14.853
Which means you're
in that as well.

32:14.854 --> 32:16.087
I just said everybody.

32:16.088 --> 32:17.589
Robyn, just stop talking.

32:17.590 --> 32:19.424
I don't have to
stop talking, Kimmie.

32:19.425 --> 32:21.059
Ugh!

32:21.060 --> 32:23.295
<i>Kimmie, just relax, just relax.</i>

32:23.296 --> 32:24.963
<i>It's ridiculous.</i>

32:24.964 --> 32:27.065
I'm just not gonna be
anybody's bitch.

32:27.066 --> 32:30.769
The entire day
has just been ridiculous.

32:30.770 --> 32:34.039
The fighting in the kitchen,
I'm so over all of it.

32:34.040 --> 32:35.240
It's a recipe for failure.

32:35.241 --> 32:36.274
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah.

32:36.275 --> 32:37.676
Yeah, yeah.
Yup, yup!

32:37.677 --> 32:40.445
That was great.
Hi, girls.

32:40.446 --> 32:44.549
Hello, ladies.
How are you?

32:44.550 --> 32:47.085
The girls are not really
talking. They looked beat up.

32:47.086 --> 32:51.056
You can feel the tension
in the air between these ladies.

32:51.057 --> 32:53.625
You all right?
Mm-hmm.

32:53.626 --> 32:55.894
Me and Robyn weren't
getting along at all.

32:55.895 --> 32:57.996
I don't know how we go
from best friends one day

32:57.997 --> 33:00.198
to "I'm gonna treat you
like ." I don't get it.

33:00.199 --> 33:01.900
But I'm just gonna let it go,

33:01.901 --> 33:03.635
and I'm gonna kick ass
in service tomorrow.

33:03.636 --> 33:05.303
That's all I can do.

33:05.304 --> 33:07.105
If I let it bother me
and try to talk to the bitch,

33:07.106 --> 33:08.940
it's gonna be childish ,

33:08.941 --> 33:10.108
and I'm done
wi with all the childish games.

33:12.511 --> 33:15.780
I am definitely constantly
stressed on this team.

33:15.781 --> 33:18.750
The lack of sleep
and the arguing all the time.

33:18.751 --> 33:22.320
I'm over it, so hopefully
I'll be able to sleep tonight.

33:22.321 --> 33:24.222
I doubt it, but maybe
I'll be able to get

33:24.223 --> 33:26.391
two or three hours,
'cause I need it.

33:28.294 --> 33:30.428
After a long, punishing day,

33:30.429 --> 33:33.098
the red team finally has
some peace and quiet.

33:33.099 --> 33:38.136
Well, maybe not exactly quiet.

33:43.175 --> 33:44.809
I am so tired.

33:44.810 --> 33:46.378
I can't sleep because
Kimmie's snoring

33:46.379 --> 33:47.946
really, really loud.

33:50.683 --> 33:52.751
This is annoying
just to have to wake up

33:52.752 --> 33:54.286
and transfer rooms to go
try to go to sleep.

33:54.287 --> 33:56.000
So I'm not in a happy mood
right now.

34:16.175 --> 34:17.542
What the ?

34:17.543 --> 34:20.210
I see this Hobbit-like figure
pop up.

34:20.212 --> 34:22.447
What's that?
And it's Robyn.

34:29.855 --> 34:31.456
We could use
not to have her there.

34:31.456 --> 34:33.358
It was just so creepy.

34:33.359 --> 34:35.226
If you see someone
in here again, it's me.

34:35.226 --> 34:38.897
Dude, that's our room.
My God.

34:38.898 --> 34:41.498
Sorry, I don't mean
to be rude, but...

34:41.500 --> 34:43.668
Really? Really?

34:43.668 --> 34:45.804
I don't want the energy
in this room changing at all.

34:45.804 --> 34:47.539
Getting mixed up
with the red team

34:47.540 --> 34:48.973
and their cattiness...

34:48.974 --> 34:50.542
"I'm gonna be friends
with you today.

34:50.543 --> 34:51.909
I'm gonna be not friends
with you tomorrow."

34:51.911 --> 34:53.945
That's why I don't trust anyone
on the red team.

34:53.946 --> 34:56.147
I'm just so pissed right now.
Why? Now what?

34:56.148 --> 34:58.750
They're all bitching
that I slept in that room.

34:58.751 --> 35:00.652
Are you serious?

35:00.653 --> 35:03.555
'Cause these females
are catty as .

35:03.556 --> 35:05.457
No wonder why I don't have
any female friends.

35:05.458 --> 35:07.726
<i>Catty. Backstabbing.
Yeah.</i>

35:07.727 --> 35:09.928
Would you guys have rather
me woken you up

35:09.929 --> 35:11.196
at 5:30 in the morning and asked
if I could sleep in your room?

35:11.197 --> 35:12.364
It's not like they own
the room,

35:12.365 --> 35:13.698
so tell 'em
to go themselves.

35:13.699 --> 35:14.933
My list is gonna be changing,

35:14.934 --> 35:16.234
who I'm gonna get
knocked off first.

35:19.438 --> 35:21.740
While Robyn
ponders her team's demise,

35:21.741 --> 35:24.509
up in the dorms, Patrick tries
to lift his spirits

35:24.510 --> 35:25.910
with a morning ritual.

35:30.516 --> 35:33.418
This is the most emotional thing
I've ever been through...

35:33.419 --> 35:35.553
missing my family.

35:35.554 --> 35:38.022
But I'm here for a reason,
and they know why I'm here.

35:38.023 --> 35:41.760
They want me to be successful.
They want their dad to win.

35:46.399 --> 35:48.933
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm gonna do it.

35:48.934 --> 35:52.137
All right, nothing left to do
but to do it, brother.

35:52.138 --> 35:55.573
Today is steak
night in Hell's Kitchen,

35:55.574 --> 35:58.276
and both teams are looking
to put their best foot forward.

35:58.277 --> 36:01.846
We pumped up, ladies?

36:01.847 --> 36:03.348
I am.

36:03.349 --> 36:05.583
Check what we have for backup
underneath so we know.

36:05.584 --> 36:07.685
I don't want to be caught
with my pants down.

36:07.686 --> 36:09.254
I'm nervous going into service
because it is steaks,

36:09.255 --> 36:10.989
and he's opening a steak house.

36:10.990 --> 36:12.524
It's gotta be there.
We gotta be on point,

36:12.525 --> 36:14.192
and we gotta keep it
really tight today.

36:14.193 --> 36:15.760
Brian.
Yeah, bud?

36:15.761 --> 36:17.595
Get all that together
right away,

36:17.596 --> 36:18.897
because we're gonna be popping
real soon.

36:18.898 --> 36:20.865
Got it.
Justin's a machine,

36:20.866 --> 36:23.368
and he wants everything
perfect.

36:23.369 --> 36:26.070
Not too much, bri.
A little bit. We're good.

36:26.071 --> 36:28.573
Do we got spoons in all those?
That would be a helpful thing.

36:28.574 --> 36:29.674
Here.

36:29.675 --> 36:31.543
Like, dude, relax.
We have time.

36:31.544 --> 36:33.511
Clemenza, you really need
a blanching pot over here.

36:33.512 --> 36:36.047
Justin kind of micromanages
everybody.

36:36.048 --> 36:38.216
He's busy
barking out orders.

36:38.217 --> 36:40.151
Shut your mouth.
Do what you gotta do.

36:40.152 --> 36:41.986
If I need your help,
I'll ask for it.

36:41.987 --> 36:43.822
Clemenza, check those carrots,

36:43.823 --> 36:45.356
'cause they weren't cooked
when I checked them.

36:45.357 --> 36:47.625
You heard me?
I heard you.

36:47.626 --> 36:49.227
Take a chill pill.

36:49.228 --> 36:51.529
You got that bacon over there,
right, Royce?

36:51.530 --> 36:54.632
While Justin won't
settle for less than perfection,

36:54.633 --> 36:56.167
over on the red team...

36:56.168 --> 36:58.069
They're supposed to be sliced.
Like that?

36:58.070 --> 37:00.205
I don't know.
Who cares?

37:00.206 --> 37:03.441
Tiffany's practices
are called into question.

37:03.442 --> 37:05.310
Tiffany doesn't care
about her standards.

37:05.311 --> 37:07.812
And I'm not gonna let her
bring us down.

37:07.813 --> 37:11.649
Tiffany's onions,
they were too thick.

37:11.650 --> 37:13.618
<i>Tiffany.</i>

37:13.619 --> 37:15.954
The onion is cut way too thick.

37:15.955 --> 37:18.122
Barbie's trying to do
a little kiss ass today too

37:18.123 --> 37:20.225
with chef Andi 'cause she thinks
she's gonna win.

37:20.226 --> 37:21.960
So good luck, Barbie.

37:21.961 --> 37:23.728
Barbie, always
calling people out

37:23.729 --> 37:25.330
to make herself
look good.

37:25.331 --> 37:26.431
<i>"Yeah, these onions
aren't right."</i>

37:26.432 --> 37:28.399
Okay, great, then fix 'em.

37:28.400 --> 37:29.934
Barbie knows everything.

37:29.935 --> 37:31.035
She knows how to
cook everything.

37:31.036 --> 37:32.837
You know, she's the H.B.I.C.

37:32.838 --> 37:34.572
Yeah, you know,
That bitch.

37:34.573 --> 37:36.040
She needs to mind
her own business

37:36.041 --> 37:37.842
and worry about herself.

37:37.843 --> 37:40.078
We really don't have time
for this. You know that, right?

37:40.079 --> 37:42.814
Ugh, honestly!
I could just break something

37:42.815 --> 37:44.582
over her head
right now.

37:44.583 --> 37:46.317
Tiffany, I have to redo these?

37:46.318 --> 37:48.086
Yeah.
Thank you, Barbie.

37:48.087 --> 37:49.888
I didn't realize
you run the show.

37:49.889 --> 37:52.023
Going into service
in under 30 minutes,

37:52.024 --> 37:54.592
there's now, you know,
this fight between

37:54.593 --> 37:56.561
Barbie and Tiffany happening.

37:56.562 --> 37:59.297
We don't have time for this
today during prep.

37:59.298 --> 38:01.666
Don't with me, bitch.

38:01.667 --> 38:03.968
Be one thing if you could
actually cook

38:03.969 --> 38:05.537
on a line first

38:05.538 --> 38:07.338
before you start
running your mouth.

38:11.601 --> 38:13.536
With less than 30 minutes

38:13.537 --> 38:14.970
before Hell's Kitchen opens
for steak night,

38:14.971 --> 38:17.139
Justin is getting the blue team
ready for battle.

38:17.140 --> 38:19.709
We're gonna be popping real soon.
Got it.

38:19.710 --> 38:21.444
While Barbie and Tiffany...

38:21.445 --> 38:23.112
Tiffany.
I have to redo these?

38:23.113 --> 38:24.547
Yeah. Thank you, Barbie.

38:24.548 --> 38:26.682
I didn't realize
you run the show.

38:26.683 --> 38:28.484
Battle each other.

38:28.485 --> 38:30.553
Don't talk to me.
Don't look at me.

38:30.554 --> 38:32.188
Just get out of here.

38:32.189 --> 38:36.592
Don't with me, bitch.

38:36.593 --> 38:38.160
It'd be one thing
if you could actually cook

38:38.161 --> 38:39.462
on a line first

38:39.463 --> 38:41.297
before you start
running your mouth.

38:41.298 --> 38:45.267
She is out of her mind.

38:45.268 --> 38:48.637
I have no idea why Tiffany
is mad at me. I don't care.

38:48.638 --> 38:51.474
I'm not gonna let this bickering
get to me.

38:51.475 --> 38:54.343
I came here for a job.

38:54.344 --> 38:56.679
Barbie and
Tiffany are fighting,

38:56.680 --> 38:59.181
Kimmie and Robyn are
still pissed off.

38:59.182 --> 39:02.384
You don't have to be friends,
but when we are in this kitchen,

39:02.385 --> 39:04.620
like, drop all of your
drama at the door.

39:04.621 --> 39:06.122
That's what we have to do

39:06.123 --> 39:08.357
if we want to win
tonight's service.

39:08.358 --> 39:10.392
<i>Ladies, let's go.
Line up, please.</i>

39:10.393 --> 39:12.094
Let's go, guys.
Line up. Quick.

39:12.095 --> 39:16.866
<i>Let's go.</i>

39:16.867 --> 39:20.269
<i>As you know, the winner
of this year's Hell's Kitchen</i>

39:20.270 --> 39:24.807
becomes the head chef at
Gordon Ramsay's Steak in Vegas.

39:24.808 --> 39:26.542
Tonight is steak night.

39:26.543 --> 39:30.479
So I am gonna be studying
every little detail, trust me.

39:30.480 --> 39:32.848
Justin, you did such a good job
with that filet mignon,

39:32.849 --> 39:34.350
<i>it's actually on the menu
tonight. Congratulations.</i>

39:34.351 --> 39:35.584
It's an honor.
Thank you, chef.

39:35.585 --> 39:37.253
<i>Good. Delicious.</i>

39:37.254 --> 39:39.688
<i>Really good, indeed.
Okay...</i>

39:39.689 --> 39:41.824
Alongside steak night,
it's family night.

39:41.825 --> 39:43.692
And we have a children's menu.

39:43.693 --> 39:45.427
Nothing worse than kids
getting anxious and waiting

39:45.428 --> 39:47.630
for their food,
so make it count.

39:47.631 --> 39:50.166
Yes, chef.
Okay, get on your stations.

39:50.167 --> 39:52.802
Let's go.
Yes, chef.

39:52.803 --> 39:55.437
Guys, here we go.
Check your ovens, guys.

39:55.438 --> 39:58.440
This is the night I win
chef's praise and admiration

39:58.441 --> 40:00.476
and get myself back on track.

40:00.477 --> 40:03.045
It's time for a good service,
and I'm amped, man.

40:03.046 --> 40:05.681
Let's do this.
Let's do this.

40:05.682 --> 40:07.683
Ready, guys?
Let's go, ladies.

40:07.684 --> 40:09.118
Tonight I'm on meat.

40:09.119 --> 40:10.419
There's a lot of pressure
just because

40:10.420 --> 40:12.121
right now it's steak night.

40:12.122 --> 40:14.790
My steaks have to come out
perfect every time tonight.

40:14.791 --> 40:16.992
Let's rock this.
I'm ready to show chef Ramsay

40:16.993 --> 40:18.961
that I'm here to win
this competition.

40:18.962 --> 40:22.298
Do or die time.

40:22.299 --> 40:24.567
<i>Oh, my God!
Medic!</i>

40:24.568 --> 40:27.870
I just burned my hand.

40:27.871 --> 40:29.505
<i>Can we get a medic?
Ugh!</i>

40:29.506 --> 40:31.373
<i>What happened? What happened?</i>

40:31.374 --> 40:33.876
<i>Kimmie got burned.
Yeah, bad. Oh, my God.</i>

40:33.877 --> 40:35.911
Clemenza, take her
to the medic.

40:35.912 --> 40:37.680
Yes, chef. Come on, come on.
Kimmie, you're gonna be okay.

40:37.681 --> 40:39.748
Come on. Come on.

40:39.749 --> 40:41.350
<i>Come on, don't give up.
Unh!</i>

40:41.351 --> 40:43.385
Come on, come on.
Just stay here.

40:43.386 --> 40:44.920
Let me call and get you
a medic somehow.

40:44.921 --> 40:48.257
We got a medic coming?

40:48.258 --> 40:50.426
What happened here?
Hold on... I got two burns.

40:50.427 --> 40:52.494
I got one here and one here.

40:52.495 --> 40:54.997
So this just now happened right
here, right now? Yeah. Yeah.

40:54.998 --> 40:57.833
Okay.
Oh, my God.

40:57.834 --> 41:00.369
It hurts so bad.
Okay, breathe.

41:00.370 --> 41:02.238
My team needs me tonight.

41:02.239 --> 41:04.540
You're not allowed to go back
in that kitchen for right now.

41:04.541 --> 41:06.108
Kimmie has suffered
very serious grease burns

41:06.109 --> 41:07.509
to her hand and arm.

41:07.510 --> 41:09.545
And now her future
in Hell's Kitchen

41:09.546 --> 41:11.747
hangs in the balance.
I'm pretty scared.

41:11.748 --> 41:13.349
I do not want
to go home tonight,

41:13.350 --> 41:14.783
but if I can't cook,

41:14.784 --> 41:16.819
this is the end for me
in Hell's Kitchen.

41:16.820 --> 41:19.455
Okay, breathe.
How did you manage to burn yourself

41:19.456 --> 41:21.624
all the way up there?
I don't know.

41:21.625 --> 41:23.826
You need to cool the skin down.
You're not going back in there.

41:23.827 --> 41:25.661
Just breathe while I do this.

41:25.662 --> 41:28.063
This sucks!

41:28.064 --> 41:30.132
I know it hurts.
I know it hurts. Hold still.

41:30.133 --> 41:31.667
Big, deep breaths.

41:31.668 --> 41:33.602
I feel like I'm about to pass out.
Be careful.

41:33.603 --> 41:35.638
<i>Breathe. Breathe.
I need you to exhale.</i>

41:38.208 --> 41:40.843
<i>Next time on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

41:40.844 --> 41:44.613
<i>Kimmie's burn is so severe...
You're not going back in there.</i>

41:44.614 --> 41:47.416
She may not make
it back to dinner service.

41:47.417 --> 41:49.818
But that doesn't stop Robyn...
All hell is gonna break loose.

41:49.819 --> 41:51.921
From going after her.

41:51.922 --> 41:53.355
You better watch who
you're calling bitch!

41:53.356 --> 41:55.057
<i>Hey! Hey!
Get in my face.</i>

41:55.058 --> 41:56.725
I'm just thinking,
"who's gonna hit who first?"

41:56.726 --> 41:58.327
What are you gonna do?

41:58.328 --> 42:00.195
Get the out of my face,
you stupid bitch!

42:00.196 --> 42:02.531
And Patrick...
Oh, my God!

42:02.532 --> 42:04.466
Makes a mistake
so unbelievable...

42:04.467 --> 42:06.535
Three filets... sorry...
Patrick!

42:06.536 --> 42:08.904
Chef Ramsay is
forced to make a drastic move.

42:08.905 --> 42:11.407
off.
Aah!

42:11.408 --> 42:13.375
It was a stupid, bonehead move.

42:13.376 --> 42:15.945
On a night with
kids in the dining room,

42:15.946 --> 42:17.980
there's one chef thinking
of his.

42:17.981 --> 42:19.615
I keep letting my family down.

42:19.616 --> 42:21.483
And they were so proud
of me to go here.

42:21.484 --> 42:23.319
And I'm blowin' it.

42:23.320 --> 42:25.821
As the competition
gets more intense...

42:25.822 --> 42:27.589
Stop. I wouldn't even
feed that to my cat!

42:27.590 --> 42:29.325
Pressure builds...

42:29.326 --> 42:30.793
She thinks she runs this place.

42:30.794 --> 42:32.962
I've just had it.
You wanna talk, talk!

42:32.963 --> 42:35.264
And friendships
are shattered.

42:35.265 --> 42:37.099
You know what, Kimmie, if you
really want to get dirty now,

42:37.100 --> 42:39.168
there's no friends
in this competition

42:39.169 --> 42:40.602
because I want to work for him.
Talk, talk, talk, talk.

42:40.603 --> 42:42.838
This is insane.
Next time...

42:42.839 --> 42:44.473
Kimmie, stop it!
No, Robyn!

42:44.474 --> 42:45.808
On the most in-your-face...

42:45.809 --> 42:47.810
Hit me, ...
Robyn, come here!

42:47.811 --> 42:49.812
Get the popcorn 'cause
it's about to get good.

42:49.813 --> 42:51.413
Robyn. Robyn!
Hit me! Hit me!
