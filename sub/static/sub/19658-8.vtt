WEBVTT

00:05.397 --> 00:08.848
- I am Groot.
- Got that right, bud.

00:09.400 --> 00:13.750
Ain't every day a princess invites you
to a party for helping avert a war.

00:13.790 --> 00:16.468
It's a peace conference,
Rocket, not a party.

00:16.493 --> 00:20.165
The Rigellians and the Empathetics still
have a lot of issues to grapple with.

00:20.190 --> 00:22.671
Drax the Destroyer
is an excellent grappler.

00:22.696 --> 00:26.014
I must ensure the success of this
conference for Princess Tana.

00:26.039 --> 00:29.055
She is like a daughter to me.
That's why we must all wear

00:29.080 --> 00:30.800
the traditional Rigellian headgear.

00:32.081 --> 00:34.865
Pass. Hats are beneath me.

00:34.938 --> 00:39.041
You lick your own fur, but helmets
are beneath your dignity?

00:39.066 --> 00:43.697
Look, wearing the silly hats is the one
thing we have to do to get into the party.

00:47.225 --> 00:50.139
Okay. There's one more thing
we have to do.

00:50.590 --> 00:53.143
Break up the fight before there's
no food left for the party.

00:54.550 --> 00:56.335
Empathetic barbarian!

00:56.360 --> 00:58.306
Rigellian oppressor!

01:01.647 --> 01:03.368
This is intolerable, Jukka.

01:03.393 --> 01:06.316
As leader of the Empathetics,
you must wear the helmet.

01:06.341 --> 01:09.210
It represents Rigellian
tradition and heritage.

01:09.235 --> 01:12.036
Know what else they represent,
Grand Commissioner?

01:12.061 --> 01:16.471
Rigellian conformity, suppression
of emotions, and hat hair!

01:16.783 --> 01:19.890
Let me show you
what I think of your helmets!

01:23.615 --> 01:26.007
Allow me to return the favor.

01:27.364 --> 01:30.927
Father, Jukka, please stop.
This is a peace conference.

01:31.110 --> 01:32.589
Step aside, Tana.

01:32.614 --> 01:34.356
You may be a neutral party,

01:34.381 --> 01:37.340
but I must teach this emotional
ruffian a lesson.

01:41.133 --> 01:43.770
Seriously, who cares
about a krutackin' hat?

01:43.795 --> 01:45.398
Apparently they do.

01:46.097 --> 01:47.660
Cosmo, where are you?

01:47.685 --> 01:50.107
We need security
in the marketplace, now!

01:51.454 --> 01:54.675
Which you should know already,
being a telepathic pooch and all.

01:55.577 --> 01:57.124
I haven't seen a food fight this good

01:57.149 --> 01:59.498
since I nailed Mikey Coogan
with a trayful of sloppy...

02:00.990 --> 02:02.720
This is a peace conference.

02:02.991 --> 02:05.538
Cease this fighting,
or I will hurt you!

02:05.784 --> 02:08.800
How dare you wear
the red Helmets of War

02:08.824 --> 02:11.195
instead of the gray Helmets of Peace!

02:11.611 --> 02:14.392
I was unaware the hats
came in different colors.

02:14.417 --> 02:16.012
Okay, okay.
Hey, look. Hey, look.

02:16.037 --> 02:18.601
We're removing
the Helmets of War. See?

02:22.701 --> 02:26.230
How dare you allow the helmets
to touch the ground!

02:26.255 --> 02:28.904
And we're picking the helmets up.

02:28.929 --> 02:30.571
Mmm...

02:32.000 --> 02:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:41.112 --> 02:42.077
Whoa!

02:42.102 --> 02:44.391
Somebody gonna pick that up?

02:45.245 --> 02:48.445

- addic7ed.com -

03:02.187 --> 03:03.532
I am Groot!

03:17.006 --> 03:19.243
Hold on! I'll weld
the support struts!

03:21.410 --> 03:24.253
Quill, no!
The heat is softening the metal!

03:44.270 --> 03:46.758
Couldn't have just done that
in the first place?

03:48.320 --> 03:50.194
In light of this
breach of protocol,

03:50.230 --> 03:52.647
I propose we postpone
the opening ceremony

03:52.672 --> 03:55.110
and proceed directly to negotiations,

03:55.275 --> 03:58.005
so that the helmet issue
may be resolved.

03:58.030 --> 03:59.435
Agreed.

04:01.456 --> 04:02.726
As you can see,

04:02.751 --> 04:06.332
there is still much tension between
the Rigellians and Empathetics.

04:06.357 --> 04:09.233
We will require extra security
at the conference.

04:09.492 --> 04:13.439
We will see to it, Tana, once we
find that tiny mammal, Cosmo.

04:14.035 --> 04:15.339
Thank you, Drax.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.678
So, uh, no party?

04:19.704 --> 04:22.606
We just have to do one more thing.

04:22.631 --> 04:25.364
You know how many "one more
things" I've done already?

04:25.400 --> 04:27.988
Huh! Where is that mutt?

04:28.934 --> 04:30.973
Cosmo! Here, boy!

04:31.425 --> 04:32.493
Cosmo!

04:33.310 --> 04:35.648
I'm just thinking nasty thoughts.

04:35.673 --> 04:38.574
That usually brings
the mind-readin' mutt runnin'.

04:38.610 --> 04:40.410
Should we not search his office?

04:40.602 --> 04:42.880
Yeah, right.
A dog with an office.

04:51.452 --> 04:54.000
Okay, so a dog with an office.
One to grow on.

04:57.286 --> 05:00.342
I ain't stooping so low
to go through a doggie door.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.943
And you can take that literally, Drax.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.812
Ugh! Dog drool. Ugh!

05:07.837 --> 05:10.223
Why would he leave this thing
on the comm unit?

05:12.879 --> 05:15.410
Oh. Maybe 'cause it <i> is</i>
the comm unit.

05:15.590 --> 05:18.106
<i>You believe you have reached Cosmo,</i>

05:18.131 --> 05:20.840
<i>but Cosmo believes you should believe</i>

05:20.865 --> 05:22.995
<i>in leaving message at sound of beep.</i>

05:23.020 --> 05:25.819
<i>You can believe Cosmo will call back.</i>

05:26.010 --> 05:28.140
Holy krutack!
You hear that?

05:28.180 --> 05:30.171
Cosmo's joined the Believers!

05:30.320 --> 05:32.347
What, just because
he said "believe" a lot?

05:32.372 --> 05:34.056
Come on. He's a dog.

05:34.243 --> 05:36.163
He has a limited vocabulary.

05:36.267 --> 05:37.762
Rocket may be right.

05:37.846 --> 05:40.020
The Believers have been
scooping up a lot of people

05:40.045 --> 05:43.052
with mind powers,
like Mantis and Ebony Maw.

05:43.195 --> 05:46.680
Cosmo is not a person,
but he does have mind powers.

05:46.705 --> 05:49.303
You know, that's just
your anti-dog prejudice talking.

05:49.328 --> 05:52.356
Cosmo can't be a traitor.
He's man's best friend!

05:52.431 --> 05:54.180
I am Groot.

05:54.210 --> 05:57.434
Like the tree says, we ain't men.

05:57.590 --> 06:00.320
And Cosmo's gone missing
right when Knowhere

06:00.345 --> 06:03.413
is hosting several
powerful Rigellian telekinetics.

06:03.438 --> 06:06.704
The peace conference could be
a target for the Believers.

06:06.729 --> 06:10.254
We'll start by tracking down Cosmo,
who would never be a traitor.

06:10.279 --> 06:12.415
I will provide security
for the conference.

06:12.440 --> 06:15.043
We cannot allow harm
to come to Princess Tana.

06:15.068 --> 06:16.787
Especially from you.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.500
I propose we settle
the issue of headgear.

06:22.525 --> 06:25.474
If the Empathetics will not
wear the ceremonial helmets,

06:25.499 --> 06:29.194
could they at least be persuaded
to comb their unruly hair?

06:29.761 --> 06:33.984
That sounds like a reasonable
compromise. Jukka?

06:35.127 --> 06:37.220
Sure. Whatever.

06:40.224 --> 06:42.415
Then I believe we should begin...

06:42.440 --> 06:44.520
You believe? Traitor!

06:44.550 --> 06:45.657
- Drax, no! 
- Huh?

06:45.682 --> 06:46.909
Stop!

06:54.057 --> 06:57.620
Govern your emotions, brute.
They will be the end of you.

06:57.867 --> 07:00.060
You betray your own daughter!

07:00.240 --> 07:02.267
Back off, flatliner!

07:03.351 --> 07:05.090
Delegates, please!

07:14.250 --> 07:17.245
Looks like someone used
the Continuum Cortex recently.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.648
Judging by these fresh paw
prints, I'd say it's our mutt.

07:20.673 --> 07:23.587
We gotta follow him. Program it to
send us to the same coordinates.

07:23.612 --> 07:25.403
I am Groot.

07:25.428 --> 07:27.450
Passport wristbands.
Good idea, Groot.

07:27.475 --> 07:29.363
Don't want this
to be a one-way trip.

07:29.388 --> 07:30.854
Okay, Rocket. Hit it.

07:45.802 --> 07:46.602
Hmm?

07:50.226 --> 07:52.740
I believe, I believe, I believe...

07:53.162 --> 07:54.839
I think we're
on a Believer ship.

07:54.864 --> 07:58.402
So, the pooch teleported right
into the heart of our enemies.

07:58.427 --> 08:02.350
Yeah. Probably just a big,
fat, old coinkidink.

08:02.375 --> 08:05.825
You know, how about we find Cosmo
first before we jump to conclusions?

08:06.788 --> 08:10.431
All right, fine. But remember,
the mutt's a mind reader,

08:10.456 --> 08:12.914
so don't think about him,
or he'll know we're here.

08:14.590 --> 08:17.260
I am Groot.
What did I just say?

08:17.285 --> 08:19.834
I told ya not to think
about him, bark-for-brains!

08:19.859 --> 08:22.993
What are Quill, rodent,
and tree friend doing here?

08:23.018 --> 08:26.092
What are we doing here?
What are you doing here?

08:26.110 --> 08:29.089
Yeah, on a Believer ship, ya turncoat!

08:29.308 --> 08:30.927
Away to put weapons.

08:30.952 --> 08:34.703
Cosmo is no coat-turner.
Is undercover.

08:35.371 --> 08:37.813
See? I knew
he wasn't a traitor.

08:37.839 --> 08:39.530
Who's a good boy?
You are.

08:39.559 --> 08:40.591
Ugh!

08:40.616 --> 08:44.649
Cosmo thinks Believers have plan
to sabotage Rigellian peace talks.

08:44.674 --> 08:47.870
But Believers able to
mask thoughts from Cosmo.

08:47.895 --> 08:51.045
Cosmo must dig for truth
like buried bone.

08:51.070 --> 08:52.409
Intruders!

08:56.189 --> 08:58.685
The Guardians of the Galaxy.

08:58.710 --> 09:01.305
How utterly predictable.

09:08.628 --> 09:10.874
Take the Star-Lord
and his friends

09:10.899 --> 09:14.256
to a holding cell until
judgment can be rendered.

09:14.281 --> 09:18.496
Although I believe
they will be found guilty.

09:29.410 --> 09:32.485
Still think your four-legged pal
is on our side?

09:33.732 --> 09:37.345
Okay, yes, this looks bad,
but there's gotta be an explanation.

09:37.370 --> 09:38.830
I am Groot.

09:38.860 --> 09:41.300
That fleabag blasted us in the back!

09:41.325 --> 09:43.252
What more proof do ya need?

09:43.971 --> 09:46.573
Look. Cosmo left us
a means to escape.

09:46.598 --> 09:50.145
He would've taken our passport wristbands
if he really betrayed us, right?

09:51.700 --> 09:54.120
Or he's just stupid,

09:54.150 --> 09:55.872
like everything else from your planet.

09:55.897 --> 09:58.391
Either way, let's just use 'em
and get outta here.

10:01.810 --> 10:03.477
That sounds like Cosmo.

10:04.366 --> 10:05.841
We gotta save him.

10:05.866 --> 10:07.188
I am Groot.

10:07.256 --> 10:11.194
Fine! But only to put a muzzle
on that krutackin' howling.

10:11.219 --> 10:12.519
Ugh!

10:14.880 --> 10:17.742
I believe I can get us outta here.

10:18.078 --> 10:20.087
Don't start.

10:20.925 --> 10:23.725
Quill! Rocket!
I need backup at the conference!

10:24.044 --> 10:24.974
Quill?

10:26.957 --> 10:28.317
Believer spy!

10:28.342 --> 10:30.935
Your treachery will not
disrupt this conference!

10:39.560 --> 10:41.590
Unhand me, barbarian!

10:41.620 --> 10:44.103
Drax, please release him.

10:44.128 --> 10:49.154
My father and I may disagree on
many things, but he is no traitor.

10:51.270 --> 10:53.105
Ow! Huh?

10:53.857 --> 10:56.689
I will be watching you,
tiny bearded man.

10:56.722 --> 10:59.165
I appreciate your vigilance, Drax,

10:59.190 --> 11:03.559
but you must realize the
delicacy of these negotiations.

11:03.584 --> 11:07.107
That is why I will make sure they are
not sabotaged by Believer spies.

11:07.132 --> 11:10.921
Perhaps you can do that
from... outside the room?

11:10.940 --> 11:13.801
Or at least sitting quietly
in the corner?

11:13.826 --> 11:15.627
I'll keep an eye on him.

11:18.032 --> 11:21.611
Let us begin the negotiations
with opening statements.

11:21.636 --> 11:24.807
- Grand Commissioner, would you care to...
- I object!

11:24.832 --> 11:27.458
How can we trust you
to be an impartial judge

11:27.483 --> 11:31.653
when you choose to wear the very
symbol of Rigellian conformity?

11:31.690 --> 11:34.590
Trust me, you are not a hat person.

11:34.630 --> 11:36.907
- Hey! 
- How dare you insult Princess Tana!

11:36.932 --> 11:38.730
All hats compliment her features!

11:38.770 --> 11:41.658
I know who is endangering
the conference.

11:41.889 --> 11:44.172
- Who? Tell me, and I will...
- It's you, Drax!

11:44.197 --> 11:47.624
Not the Rigellians, not the
Empathetics, and not the Believers.

11:47.840 --> 11:48.796
You!

11:49.395 --> 11:51.848
But I was attempting to help.

11:54.538 --> 11:57.535
I know. Just... don't.

12:04.585 --> 12:08.696
Your only belief was that you
could deceive us, Cosmo.

12:11.130 --> 12:15.804
Pity. He could've turned
so many into Believers.

12:15.829 --> 12:20.109
Once we've harvested all of his
psychic energy, he still will.

12:20.607 --> 12:23.501
Come. Our ship
approaches Knowhere.

12:27.942 --> 12:29.400
Now's our chance.

12:30.215 --> 12:31.969
I am Groot!

12:37.212 --> 12:38.780
Let's get you outta here, pal.

12:44.118 --> 12:46.393
Uhh! Aah! I take it back!

12:46.418 --> 12:48.861
That furball's a traitor
through and through!

12:49.678 --> 12:52.289
He's just behaving like a normal dog.

12:52.314 --> 12:55.241
This thing must've sucked out his 
intelligence along with his mind powers.

12:55.266 --> 12:58.446
Yeah, well, if he don't quit yapping,
he's gonna alert the whole stinking ship!

12:58.471 --> 13:00.648
Grab him
so we can teleport outta here!

13:01.729 --> 13:03.680
I am Groot!

13:03.705 --> 13:06.701
Fine. I'll catch him.

13:06.800 --> 13:09.418
Surrender, Guardians!

13:09.443 --> 13:12.394
I believe you can kiss my grits.

13:16.886 --> 13:19.014
Quill, now!

13:25.810 --> 13:28.598
You know what I think about helmets?

13:28.623 --> 13:31.734
I think somebody's compensating
for something.

13:31.770 --> 13:35.773
You know the old saying:
"Big hat, small brain."

13:35.798 --> 13:38.442
Your statement is both
incorrect and insulting...

13:38.474 --> 13:40.971
the product of
an overly emotional infant.

13:40.996 --> 13:42.872
You're not helping, Father.

13:42.897 --> 13:46.248
Both of you, please apologize.

13:46.410 --> 13:49.700
I will not apologize
for speaking the truth.

13:50.411 --> 13:53.331
Well, there's one thing
we can agree on, old man.

13:56.020 --> 13:59.074
I have
not yet begun to agree.

13:59.099 --> 14:00.904
Drax, help me stop this.

14:01.270 --> 14:04.461
- You ordered me not to help.
- I can do this all day!

14:04.486 --> 14:05.921
As can I.

14:06.169 --> 14:09.856
Use your powers to throw him into
the fight. That'll get him going.

14:14.857 --> 14:18.468
Hey! No fighting at the peace conference.
We got a situation.

14:22.399 --> 14:25.617
Thought you might like to know the
Believers are about to attack.

14:29.085 --> 14:31.226
They would not listen to me either.

14:36.561 --> 14:37.557
Aah!

14:40.110 --> 14:43.410
What happened to my powers?
How did you do this?

14:43.440 --> 14:46.312
My telekinetic abilities
have also failed.

14:46.337 --> 14:50.154
The only rational explanation is
the action of an outside force.

14:53.473 --> 14:55.909
Something must be draining
all of our powers.

15:03.630 --> 15:06.213
Specifically, that "something."

15:08.194 --> 15:09.515
The Believers.

15:09.540 --> 15:12.509
Psychic energy
siphon at maximum capacity.

15:16.012 --> 15:17.748
Locking on target.

15:25.776 --> 15:28.170
The Believers ain't
just draining your powers,

15:28.200 --> 15:29.951
they're draining all of Knowhere!

15:35.503 --> 15:37.319
If Cosmo's any indication,

15:37.344 --> 15:41.166
once they're done draining
your powers, it's bye-bye, brain.

15:45.080 --> 15:47.736
Commencing
psychic energy upload.

15:51.953 --> 15:53.032
Huh?

15:53.640 --> 15:55.532
<i>Rejoice, Rigellians!</i>

15:55.557 --> 15:59.442
<i>Your mental powers
will serve the Believers!</i>

15:59.620 --> 16:02.620
Yeah, right after you
turn their brains into mush.

16:02.645 --> 16:05.808
Okay, listen up. We're gonna
need a two-prong strategy here...

16:05.833 --> 16:07.863
one prong to take out
that Believer flagship,

16:07.888 --> 16:10.512
and the other to rally
the Rigellians to fight back.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.647
I approve of these prongs.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.710
Rocket and Groot,
you're with me in the <i> Milano.</i>

16:14.735 --> 16:16.946
I am Groot.

16:20.190 --> 16:21.904
Bad dog! Stay!

16:22.373 --> 16:23.912
Stay! Stay!

16:33.955 --> 16:35.130
Target locked.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.993
Hit 'em with everything we've got!

16:37.018 --> 16:38.342
I'm trying!

16:46.770 --> 16:49.733
The belief siphon
charges our shields faster

16:49.758 --> 16:52.277
than their feeble weapons
can deplete them.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.693
Yeah, go chase your tail, mutt!

17:02.718 --> 17:04.948
Ain't my fault their shields
are too strong.

17:05.020 --> 17:07.356
Gamora, it's time for your prong!

17:07.381 --> 17:10.563
Will try, but the Rigellians are
getting weaker by the second.

17:10.588 --> 17:13.446
We must all work together if we
are to defeat the Believers.

17:14.144 --> 17:17.804
I cannot work with this
arrogant, un-centered fool.

17:18.713 --> 17:20.917
Never trust a helmet-head.

17:27.825 --> 17:30.010
The ship can't take
much more of this firepower.

17:30.373 --> 17:33.303
And I can't take much more
of that krutackin' barking!

17:34.865 --> 17:35.691
Fine.

17:35.716 --> 17:39.812
I'm sorry.
You're a good dog, okay?

17:42.740 --> 17:45.522
- Down, boy. Down, boy. 
- We're trying to fight a space battle.

17:48.335 --> 17:49.852
You trying to tell me something?

17:50.185 --> 17:53.365
Nose. You want us to aim
for the ship's nose!

17:54.186 --> 17:58.089
<i>Guys! We need you to open a hole in
the shields over the ship's nose!</i>

17:58.114 --> 18:01.042
It's no use. Without something
to unify my people,

18:01.067 --> 18:03.337
we won't be strong enough
to breach those shields.

18:03.362 --> 18:07.771
There is only one thing both sides
can agree on: they all hate me.

18:07.980 --> 18:09.799
Throw me at the forward shield.

18:10.813 --> 18:13.570
That's it!
Unite in your hatred of Drax.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.282
It will give you strength.

18:15.307 --> 18:17.356
Hurl Drax at the Believer shield!

18:17.560 --> 18:20.281
Rigellian helmets are ridiculous,

18:20.306 --> 18:23.972
and Empathetics are childish
buffoons with bad hair!

18:24.426 --> 18:27.490
- Insolence!
- I'm sorry, what did you just call me?

18:27.923 --> 18:29.538
Throw him out of here!

18:39.179 --> 18:40.280
What?

18:40.320 --> 18:42.252
Now, Rocket!
Take the shot!

18:42.284 --> 18:44.214
Where? That ship's
got a big nose!

18:44.239 --> 18:47.690
Cosmo, settle down!
I can't hear myself think!

18:53.125 --> 18:56.515
What's that? You want me to
target the guidance thrusters?

18:56.540 --> 18:58.141
Dude, he's just a dog.

18:58.166 --> 19:01.995
Yeah, a krutackin' smart one,
even without his powers.

19:22.775 --> 19:25.624
Whoo-hoo! Score one
for the four-leggers!

19:25.743 --> 19:28.048
I think there's a two-legger
that needs our help.

19:33.524 --> 19:35.718
Hang in there, Draxy.
We're coming.

19:43.669 --> 19:46.680
I am Groot.

19:49.003 --> 19:52.121
We've lost power!
Our ship cannot maintain orbit!

20:11.830 --> 20:14.020
Mantis, Ebony Maw,

20:14.045 --> 20:17.355
I <i> believe</i> you should surrender.

20:17.917 --> 20:21.870
Hello? I'm reading life signs,
but they ain't responding to our hails.

20:21.895 --> 20:24.796
Eh, they can sit tight
till Nova Corps digs them out.

20:24.821 --> 20:28.143
And since we've got
some extra time, how about...

20:28.168 --> 20:30.439
We finally head over
to the peace conference party?

20:30.730 --> 20:32.960
No more "one more thing."

20:36.234 --> 20:39.517
Thanks to the Guardians, my
people have reached an agreement.

20:39.542 --> 20:43.908
The Rigellians and Empathetics are
both in favor of facial hair.

20:43.933 --> 20:46.921
It's an expression of individuality.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.838
And useful for stroking
and focusing thought.

20:50.546 --> 20:53.496
It's a start. And we wouldn't
have gotten this far

20:53.521 --> 20:55.648
had Drax not united the factions

20:55.673 --> 20:58.879
and then stayed away for the
remainder of the conference.

20:58.904 --> 21:01.564
That's because he trusted you
to handle it on your own.

21:01.589 --> 21:03.472
That's a start too.

21:03.497 --> 21:05.061
Don't worry, Cosmo.

21:05.187 --> 21:07.351
We'll find a way
to restore your powers.

21:07.759 --> 21:09.941
I am Groot.

21:09.990 --> 21:14.785
Ha! Ah, if a dog can make peace with a tree
and a raccoon, anything's possible.

21:14.810 --> 21:16.716
What did you call me?

21:17.550 --> 21:19.620
Now, this is my kind of party.

21:19.650 --> 21:21.739
But there is no party out here.

21:21.890 --> 21:23.340
Exactly.

21:25.153 --> 21:27.727
Nobody calls me "raccoon"!
Ya hear me, Quill?

21:27.752 --> 21:28.585
Nobody!

21:29.850 --> 21:32.458
Aah! Ow! Ow!
