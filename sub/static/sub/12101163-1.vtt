WEBVTT

01:20.893 --> 01:22.360
- Fuck.
- Do it again?

01:22.427 --> 01:23.595
Yeah, daddy.

01:25.699 --> 01:26.499
Keep going.

01:26.565 --> 01:27.666
- Oh, oh my God.
- Oh!

01:57.832 --> 01:59.901
Hi, it's me, it's Mommy.

01:59.967 --> 02:02.469
Listen, are you coming to
the funeral today or what?

02:02.536 --> 02:04.806
Because we gotta leave soon
and you told me you were.

02:04.872 --> 02:06.707
But your dad
just said you're not.

02:06.774 --> 02:08.209
He's always 10 notes
behind, though so...

02:08.276 --> 02:11.914
He's still at the gym so who
knows if we'll even get there.

02:11.980 --> 02:14.049
Danielle, your father, useless.

02:14.116 --> 02:17.753
I ask him to do one
thing today, one thing.

02:17.820 --> 02:19.922
You know what?
Just call me back, okay?

02:19.988 --> 02:21.656
Call, do not text me.

02:23.624 --> 02:24.525
Busy day?

02:26.762 --> 02:27.863
Yeah.

02:30.032 --> 02:34.069
I have this brunch thing
that I have to get ready for.

02:34.136 --> 02:35.872
Oh, is it another client?

02:37.874 --> 02:39.976
- Yes.
- Does he have hair?

02:40.877 --> 02:43.746
- Yes, some.
- Does he have teeth?

02:43.813 --> 02:44.513
Yes.

02:45.782 --> 02:47.016
Well, how are you gonna
get through law school

02:47.083 --> 02:50.652
when you're busy screwin'
around with these guys?

02:50.720 --> 02:51.955
How are you get
through law school

02:52.021 --> 02:54.724
when you're busy screwin'
around with these guys?

02:59.528 --> 03:00.430
Don't forget, hm?

03:05.970 --> 03:06.837
Thank you.

03:06.904 --> 03:07.838
Mm hm.

03:19.817 --> 03:23.453
Um, did you remember?

03:25.857 --> 03:27.458
Oh yeah.

03:27.524 --> 03:29.493
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:39.037 --> 03:40.872
I really wanna help you
with your degree

03:40.939 --> 03:43.008
and law school and everything,

03:43.074 --> 03:47.712
and I think it's really
great to support females,

03:47.780 --> 03:50.016
particularly
female entrepreneurs.

03:50.082 --> 03:51.350
- I know.
- Who will be doing nothing

03:51.416 --> 03:53.485
with their business majors
and sociology minors.

03:53.551 --> 03:55.788
- Okay. Cool.
- You're the future.

03:55.855 --> 03:56.789
Great.

03:56.856 --> 03:57.757
Awesome.

04:17.978 --> 04:19.612
- Hello.
- Hi.

04:19.679 --> 04:20.781
Good to see you guys.

04:25.352 --> 04:27.020
Danielle!

04:27.087 --> 04:29.089
- Danielle!
- Please don't yell!

04:29.156 --> 04:30.791
I just wanna make sure
that she sees us.

04:30.857 --> 04:31.925
You're
embarrassing yourself.

04:31.992 --> 04:33.592
Would you leave me alone?

04:34.194 --> 04:36.164
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, sweetie.

04:37.131 --> 04:38.232
Listen, we could have
given you a ride.

04:38.299 --> 04:41.635
It's fine.
Why did you bring the van?

04:41.703 --> 04:42.804
Your mother
neglected to tell me

04:42.870 --> 04:44.238
that she was having
her own car fixed.

04:44.305 --> 04:45.605
I did tell him.

04:45.672 --> 04:46.341
I had to move all my
products here to the back.

04:46.407 --> 04:47.607
As a matter of fact,

04:47.674 --> 04:49.643
there was no room for
me to drive up front.

04:49.711 --> 04:50.610
Your mother had to drive.

04:50.677 --> 04:52.013
I did tell you.

04:52.080 --> 04:54.148
He doesn't listen
or he's got Alzheimer's.

04:54.215 --> 04:54.916
How was the funeral?

04:54.983 --> 04:56.951
Ah, eulogies were shit.

04:57.018 --> 04:58.886
- I liked 'em.
- You like everything.

04:58.953 --> 05:00.022
You're wearing makeup.

05:00.089 --> 05:01.957
You look nice with makeup.

05:02.024 --> 05:02.858
Thanks.

05:02.925 --> 05:03.959
How do I look?

05:04.026 --> 05:05.928
Um, you look great.

05:05.995 --> 05:07.930
- Do I?
- Yeah, Mom, you look good.

05:07.997 --> 05:09.732
You didn't say that in
a very self-assured way.

05:09.798 --> 05:10.933
You look great, Mom.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.901
Where'd you get that bracelet?

05:12.968 --> 05:15.137
- I don't know.
- Wow, it looks expensive.

05:15.204 --> 05:17.840
I think you got it for
me in like high school

05:17.906 --> 05:18.741
- or something.
- Really?

05:18.807 --> 05:19.908
- Yeah.
- I'm amazing.

05:19.975 --> 05:21.810
All right,
shall we go in, everybody?

05:21.877 --> 05:23.112
What's my sound bite again?

05:23.178 --> 05:25.115
Y'know, just that
you're finishing up finals

05:25.181 --> 05:27.616
and you've got a few
job interviews lined up.

05:27.683 --> 05:29.753
Although Moira's here and
her daughter Stephanie...

05:29.819 --> 05:30.887
- Jessica.
- Whatever.

05:30.954 --> 05:33.757
She's like this
marketing executive,

05:33.823 --> 05:34.656
kind of publicist thing.

05:34.724 --> 05:35.759
- Assistant.
- Exactly.

05:35.825 --> 05:37.060
You should really
talk to her, y'know?

05:37.127 --> 05:39.162
No, she doesn't
want to talk to her.

05:39.229 --> 05:40.196
She's not interested
in marketing.

05:40.263 --> 05:41.765
It's just a job.

05:43.700 --> 05:45.135
Why is Maya here?

05:46.803 --> 05:48.005
- Shit.
- Oh my God, Dad.

05:48.072 --> 05:49.740
We'll be here another hour.

05:49.807 --> 05:51.876
Why did you put them like
that in the first place?

05:51.942 --> 05:53.610
There's too much
stuff to get in all at once.

05:53.676 --> 05:55.279
But listen to me a second,
all right?

05:55.346 --> 05:57.314
Why don't you just tell people

05:57.381 --> 06:00.718
that temporarily you're
gonna be working with me,

06:00.785 --> 06:02.253
with your dad, just until
you find something better.

06:02.319 --> 06:04.889
No, no.
She's not gonna say that.

06:04.955 --> 06:05.756
Why not?

06:05.823 --> 06:07.024
Tell me truthfully how I look.

06:07.091 --> 06:09.326
- You look good, Mom.
- Is the hair better?

06:09.393 --> 06:11.162
Deb,
do you have my phone on you?

06:11.228 --> 06:13.065
No, you have Alzheimer's.

06:13.131 --> 06:13.832
Are you okay?

06:13.899 --> 06:15.167
- Yeah.
- Really?

06:18.003 --> 06:19.304
Can I whisper something to you?

06:19.371 --> 06:20.906
Okay.

06:20.972 --> 06:23.075
No funny business with Maya.

06:23.141 --> 06:24.176
What is that supposed to mean?

06:24.242 --> 06:24.943
You know what it means.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.044
Stop.

06:26.111 --> 06:27.345
You're lucky
I'm so open-minded.

06:27.412 --> 06:28.679
Okay, yeah you're right,
I should kiss the ground

06:28.747 --> 06:31.883
you walk on for not kicking
me out of the house.

06:31.950 --> 06:33.985
You're not in our house,
you're just on our payroll.

06:34.052 --> 06:35.087
Can we go?

06:35.153 --> 06:36.355
Yeah,
I've been waiting for you.

06:36.422 --> 06:37.790
- Right.
- Go.

06:38.391 --> 06:39.459
Oh, now you don't wait for me.

06:39.525 --> 06:41.928
- Watch the kids.
- Wait, Mom. Who died?

06:41.994 --> 06:43.229
I'm so sorry for your loss.

06:43.296 --> 06:46.899
- Thank you.
- Yeah, it's so sad.

06:46.966 --> 06:47.867
Yes.

06:50.002 --> 06:53.139
She was so full of life,
y'know?

06:53.206 --> 06:55.074
She was so... yeah.

06:55.141 --> 06:55.775
I'm really...

07:05.819 --> 07:07.855
Oh, Maya, I mean Danielle.

07:09.056 --> 07:12.893
Columbia, oh my God.
That's fantastic.

07:12.960 --> 07:15.696
It is. But
it wasn't our first choice.

07:15.762 --> 07:17.364
- You must be so proud.
- It's incredible, really,

07:17.431 --> 07:18.765
honestly.

07:18.832 --> 07:21.368
What's your line of work
that you're interested in?

07:21.435 --> 07:24.939
Well, it's sort of
like, it's media, y'know?

07:25.006 --> 07:26.107
No.

07:26.174 --> 07:27.008
Oh, you look wonderful.

07:27.075 --> 07:27.876
Thank you, so do you.

07:27.942 --> 07:30.345
Abbie would be so pleased.

07:30.411 --> 07:32.247
Does Danielle want to go
to law school or grad school?

07:32.313 --> 07:34.115
Neither right now.

07:34.182 --> 07:37.886
She's just got a few
job interviews lined up.

07:39.554 --> 07:40.788
That's great.

07:40.855 --> 07:44.159
- She lost so much weight.
- Yeah. Quite a lot.

07:44.225 --> 07:45.426
Is she okay?

07:46.761 --> 07:49.999
She just, y'know,
finals, stress... whatever.

07:50.065 --> 07:52.101
Is she seeing anyone?

07:52.168 --> 07:53.736
Not at the moment, no.

07:53.802 --> 07:56.005
Is Maya seeing anyone?

07:56.071 --> 07:57.406
Not at the moment, no.

07:57.473 --> 07:58.374
How come?

08:00.209 --> 08:01.510
Excuse me.

08:01.577 --> 08:02.945
Of course.

08:05.281 --> 08:07.082
I feel so bad for Debbie.

08:07.149 --> 08:08.851
- So good to see you.
- Thank you.

08:08.918 --> 08:09.952
Thank you for coming.

08:11.053 --> 08:12.822
There's some bagels
on the table.

08:12.889 --> 08:13.790
Oh, I'm gonna go grab one.

08:13.857 --> 08:15.325
Yeah.

08:15.392 --> 08:18.295
Maya says she's changed her
major at least a dozen times.

08:18.361 --> 08:20.864
Do you think
she has an eating disorder?

08:22.098 --> 08:24.167
Who's that? He's cute.

08:24.234 --> 08:27.537
Janice and Maury's son.
Max, I think.

08:27.604 --> 08:28.972
Can I sneak by?

08:55.866 --> 08:57.902
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:58.636 --> 09:01.273
- How are you?
- I'm good, how are you?

09:02.207 --> 09:05.143
I'm good. I'm really good.

09:05.210 --> 09:08.146
Yeah, you seem it. Seem good.

09:08.213 --> 09:10.148
Congrats on law school,
that's really great.

09:10.215 --> 09:11.416
Thanks.

09:11.483 --> 09:14.019
That only took you like
four fuckin' months.

09:15.087 --> 09:16.822
How's babysitting?

09:16.888 --> 09:18.056
Good.

09:18.123 --> 09:19.524
What are you like, are
you here this summer?

09:19.591 --> 09:22.361
It's just, I didn't know
that I was gonna see you today

09:22.427 --> 09:25.031
because I thought that you
would still be taking finals.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.266
I finished them, yesterday.

09:26.332 --> 09:28.234
And what, you just
had to like race home

09:28.301 --> 09:29.902
for your best friend Annie?

09:30.670 --> 09:31.771
Abbie.

09:32.372 --> 09:33.473
That's what I said.

09:33.539 --> 09:35.074
Well I interned for her
in high school.

09:35.141 --> 09:37.243
Oh yeah, course you did.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.444
Yeah, so my mom
and I thought it'd be

09:38.511 --> 09:40.847
like good to be with
the family in this time.

09:40.913 --> 09:43.816
Show you off, very
on brand for Katherine.

09:46.052 --> 09:47.053
Were you um,

09:48.422 --> 09:50.124
were you even at the funeral?

09:51.125 --> 09:52.059
Yeah.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.161
- Really?
- Of course I was.

09:54.228 --> 09:55.262
Yeah.

09:55.329 --> 09:56.497
Your dad was kinda
like frazzled,

09:56.563 --> 09:59.099
I don't um, he said
you were running late.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.635
Okay, well if he said
that, then why did you ask?

10:01.703 --> 10:04.638
You can't just like show
up to like the after party

10:04.706 --> 10:07.408
for a shiva and like reap
the benefits of the buffet.

10:07.474 --> 10:08.710
I didn't, I was there.

10:08.777 --> 10:10.210
Were you like looking for
me and asking everyone?

10:10.277 --> 10:13.148
No, I was not looking for
you. Let's live in the truth.

10:13.214 --> 10:14.349
Where's Danielle?

10:14.416 --> 10:16.584
What was your favorite
part of the service?

10:18.186 --> 10:19.387
The whole thing was beautiful.

10:19.454 --> 10:22.557
Interesting,
you must just be so sad.

10:22.624 --> 10:24.392
You must be really
grieving your friend Annie.

10:24.459 --> 10:27.362
Well, actually our families
are really close, y'know?

10:28.363 --> 10:30.899
She actually played bridge
with my bubby.

10:30.965 --> 10:32.434
- Bubby?
- Yeah.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.668
Okay, you've never met
your grandma.

10:33.736 --> 10:36.105
Well, thank you for
reminding me, Maya.

10:36.172 --> 10:37.473
I'll be right back.

10:37.540 --> 10:39.408
- It is so good to see you.
- We need to catch up.

10:39.475 --> 10:40.876
Yeah, come find me.

10:42.545 --> 10:43.646
- Come find me.
- What?

10:48.184 --> 10:52.388
Are you like thrilled to be
home with your peak audience?

10:53.322 --> 10:54.690
I'm not thrilled,
I'm grieving.

10:54.758 --> 10:55.925
It's a funeral.

10:55.991 --> 10:58.594
- Maya!
- I know, I'm sad too.

10:59.563 --> 11:02.132
- You remember Gloria?
- Hi, how are you?

11:02.199 --> 11:04.234
I'm good, how are you?

11:42.440 --> 11:44.442
Mom, mom, mom, who died?

11:44.509 --> 11:47.379
Abbie, Uncle Morty's
second wife's sister,

11:47.446 --> 11:48.180
you remember her.

11:48.247 --> 11:49.281
No, I don't think so.

11:49.348 --> 11:51.250
She used to play bridge
with Bubby.

11:51.316 --> 11:52.384
Really?

11:52.451 --> 11:55.254
- Here.
- Oh, Mom I can't eat that.

11:55.320 --> 11:56.455
- Why not?
- I'm vegetarian.

11:56.522 --> 11:57.356
You're killin' me.

11:57.423 --> 11:58.624
I've told you so many times.

11:58.690 --> 12:00.626
You have not eaten a
single thing all day.

12:00.692 --> 12:01.960
That's because
we just got here.

12:02.027 --> 12:04.696
You look like Gwyneth
Paltrow on food stamps.

12:04.764 --> 12:06.532
- Oh my God.
- And not in a good way.

12:06.598 --> 12:07.599
You know what Aunt Oz says?

12:07.666 --> 12:10.102
She says she thinks
you're anorexic.

12:12.338 --> 12:13.206
Danielle.

12:14.607 --> 12:17.043
Are you listening to me?
Hey, hey.

12:19.747 --> 12:20.547
Oh my God.

12:21.749 --> 12:24.217
That's Paul
and Cheryl Shapiro's nephew.

12:24.284 --> 12:25.618
He's so cute.

12:27.120 --> 12:27.721
You know what?

12:28.889 --> 12:31.090
He has a cousin
that works in publishing.

12:32.325 --> 12:34.694
- Maybe he can help you.
- Mom, stop.

12:34.762 --> 12:35.663
I have to go to the bathroom.

12:35.730 --> 12:37.131
- No no no no, let's go.
- Mom.

12:37.198 --> 12:37.833
We're gonna do this.

12:37.899 --> 12:38.834
I don't want to.

12:38.900 --> 12:39.967
- Come with me.
- I'll go later.

12:40.034 --> 12:40.701
- Now.
- I didn't eat yet and I'm...

12:40.769 --> 12:42.570
Come on, come on.

12:42.636 --> 12:43.805
I'll get his number later.

12:43.872 --> 12:44.705
- Now.
- Stop.

12:44.773 --> 12:45.539
- Now, now, now.
- No, Mom.

12:45.606 --> 12:45.673
- Now, now.
- Mom.

12:47.041 --> 12:50.244
The problem is the interest
rates and the economy...

12:50.311 --> 12:51.746
Hey, look who's here.

12:51.813 --> 12:53.547
Hi, sweetheart.

12:55.182 --> 12:56.584
Hey, oh my gosh.

12:56.650 --> 13:00.055
Max worked
for your father years ago.

13:00.121 --> 13:01.189
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:01.256 --> 13:02.557
Hi.

13:02.624 --> 13:04.192
Joel's your father?

13:04.259 --> 13:06.561
Mm hm, yeah.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.097
- Yeah.
- Okay.

13:10.065 --> 13:11.233
Do you kids know each other?

13:11.299 --> 13:15.537
Um, yeah.
We met a really long time ago.

13:15.604 --> 13:16.538
No kidding, how?

13:16.605 --> 13:17.639
At the uh.

13:17.706 --> 13:20.141
- Um, at the Beth...
- Beth Torah.

13:20.208 --> 13:22.444
- Israel, Israel, yeah.
- Beth Israel, right.

13:22.511 --> 13:24.413
You met at shul?

13:24.480 --> 13:28.217
Yeah... I was volunteering
for the children.

13:28.284 --> 13:29.685
What children?

13:29.753 --> 13:31.420
Really, I can't even get
you to go to services with me.

13:31.487 --> 13:32.756
It's a thing, you can...

13:32.823 --> 13:35.157
you can volunteer
for the Jewish children.

13:35.224 --> 13:36.459
It's like an organization.

13:36.526 --> 13:37.761
Aren't you too busy,
I mean like with school

13:37.828 --> 13:40.229
and then doing the
babysitting and everything?

13:40.296 --> 13:43.499
Oh wow, you babysit?

13:43.566 --> 13:45.067
How often do you do that?

13:45.836 --> 13:47.538
Just, y'know,
whenever they need me.

13:47.604 --> 13:48.038
They don't give
you a schedule?

13:48.105 --> 13:49.139
No.

13:49.206 --> 13:49.874
- No schedule?
- No schedule, Mom.

13:49.941 --> 13:51.809
Well, do you enjoy it?

13:51.876 --> 13:53.043
Yeah, I mean depends
on the kid,

13:53.110 --> 13:55.145
but it's a great way
to pay the bills, so.

13:55.212 --> 13:56.246
Bills?

13:56.313 --> 13:57.715
You've never paid
a bill in your life.

13:57.782 --> 13:59.182
That's... I don't...

14:00.018 --> 14:01.184
You know what I mean.

14:01.251 --> 14:01.953
That doesn't mean
she's not responsible.

14:02.020 --> 14:03.186
I've paid bills before.

14:03.253 --> 14:05.757
Listen, sweetheart, as
soon as graduation comes,

14:05.823 --> 14:06.958
you'll learn all about bills.

14:07.025 --> 14:08.760
I'll make sure
you understand everything.

14:08.826 --> 14:11.429
Right,
but you're studying business?

14:11.496 --> 14:12.397
No, not business.

14:12.463 --> 14:14.699
No no, she's studying gender.

14:14.767 --> 14:16.200
The business of gender.

14:16.267 --> 14:18.403
It's like gender business.

14:18.469 --> 14:20.538
She does this fantastic
program

14:20.605 --> 14:21.673
where you kind of design

14:21.740 --> 14:23.207
- your own major.
- It's fascinating.

14:23.274 --> 14:25.343
It's a little complex when
it comes to finding employment,

14:25.410 --> 14:26.544
but she's doing terrifically.

14:26.611 --> 14:28.379
Well, it can get a
job for a lot of people.

14:28.446 --> 14:29.882
Yes, absolutely.

14:29.949 --> 14:32.550
You are gonna make
your own job, right?

14:32.617 --> 14:33.953
Because she's so talented.

14:34.019 --> 14:35.086
Well now that you're gonna
be going to law school,

14:35.154 --> 14:36.555
you won't have to worry
about that.

14:36.622 --> 14:38.792
Law school? Where'd you get
the idea about law school?

14:38.858 --> 14:42.528
That's Maya, Maya is
going to law school.

14:42.595 --> 14:45.297
Danielle is gender business.

14:45.364 --> 14:47.399
I still don't exactly
know what that means,

14:47.466 --> 14:48.601
but she's great.

14:48.667 --> 14:49.736
What's the post-grad
plan, then?

14:49.803 --> 14:51.103
Well,
are they taking care of you?

14:51.170 --> 14:53.472
Are you making enough
money now from babysitting?

14:53.539 --> 14:54.908
No, Dad, not nearly enough

14:54.975 --> 14:56.308
considering all the hard
work that I'm doing.

14:56.375 --> 14:57.209
Well, it's a good thing
that you don't need the money.

14:57.276 --> 14:58.444
I'm saving up for something.

14:58.510 --> 15:00.380
Oh yeah, well what
are you saving up for?

15:00.447 --> 15:01.281
Your own apartment?

15:01.348 --> 15:02.783
Yes. She's doing just that.

15:02.850 --> 15:04.284
Daddy's not going to be paying
for that apartment forever.

15:04.351 --> 15:07.520
- But she's very hard-working.
- Listen, maybe you and Max

15:07.587 --> 15:08.889
could discuss this in
more detail together.

15:08.956 --> 15:10.390
Yes, yes.

15:10.457 --> 15:13.293
I mean, maybe he could help
you find the ideal position.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.528
Yeah, I'm sure he can
but I already have a plan

15:15.595 --> 15:16.764
and a path,
so I don't need that.

15:16.831 --> 15:18.231
Look, sweetheart,
feminism isn't exactly

15:18.298 --> 15:19.399
what I call a career.

15:19.466 --> 15:21.334
It's not my career.
It's a lens...

15:23.404 --> 15:24.806
...through which
to see my career.

15:24.873 --> 15:26.607
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15:26.674 --> 15:29.745
I understand, there's
acting, and there's film,

15:29.811 --> 15:31.379
there's comedy, there's
activism,

15:31.445 --> 15:32.446
there's all that stuff.

15:32.513 --> 15:33.648
But you can't really
support yourself

15:33.714 --> 15:35.751
as an adult through
babysitting, y'know?

15:35.817 --> 15:37.119
I mean, sooner or later,

15:37.184 --> 15:39.253
you're gonna have to narrow
it down to one thing.

15:39.320 --> 15:41.689
Don't you have a cousin
who's in publishing?

15:41.757 --> 15:43.624
Sam, sure.

15:43.691 --> 15:46.594
Maybe he needs an intern.

15:46.661 --> 15:48.230
- Sure.
- Yeah, would it pay?

15:48.296 --> 15:51.000
Well, some stipend
or something.

15:51.067 --> 15:53.736
I mean, you could work
out an arrangement, right?

15:53.803 --> 15:55.738
Get the family deal.

15:56.773 --> 15:58.775
Yeah, exactly.
That would be great.

15:58.841 --> 15:59.976
This beautiful thing.

16:01.576 --> 16:03.512
Oh look, they
put the desserts out.

16:03.578 --> 16:04.847
Hello.

16:06.314 --> 16:07.649
Joel.

16:07.717 --> 16:10.385
- Excuse me.
- Let others go first.

16:11.587 --> 16:12.923
You go to the gym
in the morning,

16:12.990 --> 16:15.525
you eat your weight
back to lunch.

16:15.591 --> 16:17.226
What are you gonna do?

16:23.734 --> 16:25.002
Danielle...

16:25.069 --> 16:26.302
Yeah?

16:26.369 --> 16:28.872
Could you come with me to
the kitchen for a second?

16:31.708 --> 16:33.010
He's funny.

16:33.077 --> 16:35.512
Don't go there.
He's not for you.

16:35.579 --> 16:36.915
Go where?

16:36.981 --> 16:39.751
Just try to behave yourself
today, for me please?

16:39.818 --> 16:40.852
What are you
talking about, Mom?

16:40.919 --> 16:42.553
I'm not gonna blow him
in the bathroom.

16:42.619 --> 16:43.788
We are at a shiva.

16:43.855 --> 16:45.990
That's what I'm saying,
I'm not gonna do it.

16:46.057 --> 16:49.226
And you can't go there anyway,

16:49.828 --> 16:51.328
'cause he's married.

16:54.766 --> 16:56.768
- He's married?
- Yuh huh.

16:59.504 --> 17:01.372
- Are you sure?
- Yuh huh.

17:01.974 --> 17:03.475
To a shiksa princess.

17:05.643 --> 17:07.512
Poor guy.

17:20.525 --> 17:21.426
Hey.

17:26.398 --> 17:28.735
Thank you.

17:28.802 --> 17:30.904
Thank you, Danielle.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.681
So, your folks, they're good?
They're still in Florida?

17:42.749 --> 17:46.352
Yeah they are, they've become
quite the snowbirds, actually.

17:46.418 --> 17:47.889
They bounce back and forth
quite a bit.

17:47.955 --> 17:50.390
Ah, that's so fantastic,
I love that.

17:50.457 --> 17:52.026
I've been dying
to get down there myself

17:52.093 --> 17:53.127
to play
my annual golf tournament.

17:53.194 --> 17:54.628
Oh, I didn't know
you golfed, Joel.

17:54.694 --> 17:57.364
Yeah, but I had major hip
replacement surgery this year.

17:57.430 --> 17:59.000
- I'm so sorry to hear that.
- Partial.

17:59.066 --> 18:00.902
But she won't allow
me to get on a plane.

18:00.968 --> 18:03.137
Well, that makes sense.
It's probably a good idea.

18:03.204 --> 18:05.740
So, how's
your brother, Max?

18:05.807 --> 18:07.975
Oh, he's good.
He's, y'know, he's...

18:08.042 --> 18:11.512
Um yeah, he's
your parents' favorite.

18:12.848 --> 18:13.916
You're funny.

18:15.716 --> 18:18.452
- Just kidding.
- I know.

18:18.519 --> 18:19.687
So yeah, but he's good.

18:19.755 --> 18:20.321
He's doing really good,
the practice is...

18:20.388 --> 18:22.557
And how's Kate?

18:22.623 --> 18:24.059
Um, Kim.

18:24.126 --> 18:26.494
- Kim, sorry.
- Yeah, no, it's okay.

18:26.561 --> 18:27.830
She's good.

18:27.896 --> 18:30.866
She's doin' really well.
She's on her way, actually.

18:30.933 --> 18:32.333
Oh, that's lovely.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.568
You know, I don't
know how this escaped my mind,

18:33.634 --> 18:36.605
but didn't you guys
have a baby this year?

18:36.672 --> 18:37.673
Yes we did.

18:37.740 --> 18:38.808
- Oh my God.
- That's fantastic.

18:38.875 --> 18:40.944
- Mazel tov.
- How did I not know that?

18:41.010 --> 18:41.845
What great news.

18:41.911 --> 18:43.813
Do you have photos? Let's see.

18:43.880 --> 18:44.948
Sure, of course.

18:47.884 --> 18:50.854
Aw, look at that.
Good on you, buddy.

18:50.920 --> 18:53.455
- Oh, she's gorgeous.
- Oh, what a beauty.

18:54.456 --> 18:55.959
I think you got a phone call.

18:56.025 --> 18:57.760
Oh, sorry, I'll be right back.

18:57.827 --> 18:59.096
Hello?

18:59.163 --> 19:01.564
Hi, yeah, we're in the
back. Let me come get you.

19:01.631 --> 19:03.100
It's a cute baby.

19:03.167 --> 19:04.601
You thought
that baby was cute?

19:04.667 --> 19:05.836
Yes.

19:05.903 --> 19:09.439
It was hideous,
freakishly pale and no nose.

19:09.505 --> 19:10.506
What the heck?

19:10.573 --> 19:11.809
Where are you going?

19:11.876 --> 19:12.609
Because she's
got her own business...

19:12.675 --> 19:13.710
I don't get it.

19:13.777 --> 19:15.578
I thought your mom
was watching her.

19:15.645 --> 19:16.713
I know, she got sick.

19:16.780 --> 19:17.815
What the fuck?

19:17.882 --> 19:19.449
You want the baby
getting sick?

19:19.515 --> 19:20.851
No.

19:20.918 --> 19:22.119
This is why we need
a new sitter.

19:22.186 --> 19:24.722
Okay, fine,
I'll find a new sitter.

19:24.789 --> 19:25.489
- Hi.
- Hey!

19:25.556 --> 19:26.358
How are you?

19:26.423 --> 19:27.391
Hi, good to see you.

19:27.458 --> 19:30.061
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

19:30.128 --> 19:31.695
- Oh you brought the baby!
- She's beautiful.

19:31.763 --> 19:32.964
- I know.
- My goodness.

19:33.031 --> 19:35.466
- We need a new sitter.
- I know, I'll find one.

19:35.532 --> 19:37.068
- Hi, I'm Debbie.
- I know, we met...

19:37.135 --> 19:38.837
It was at the
Glickman bris?

19:38.904 --> 19:39.971
- The bris.
- Yes.

19:40.038 --> 19:42.007
That's right.
That was fun.

19:42.073 --> 19:44.109
Well, I mean,
you know what I mean.

19:44.175 --> 19:47.914
It was good to see you
guys there, yes exactly.

19:47.980 --> 19:52.118
Oh, look at
you, you little cutie.

19:52.184 --> 19:53.853
What a nice button nose
you've got.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.821
Good thing she
doesn't have my nose.

19:55.888 --> 19:57.622
Oh my God,
look at her.

19:57.689 --> 19:58.824
Look at those eyes.

19:58.891 --> 20:01.593
She's definitely
got her mom's eyes.

20:01.660 --> 20:02.694
Beautiful.

20:03.796 --> 20:05.765
Oh, your jacket's dirty.

20:05.831 --> 20:08.768
Didn't wanna wear the one that
I took to the dry cleaners?

20:08.834 --> 20:10.635
Uh, I guess
I couldn't find it.

20:10.702 --> 20:12.105
- It's fine.
- Okay.

20:12.172 --> 20:13.974
You know what,
why don't I take her

20:14.041 --> 20:15.042
so you can get something to eat?

20:15.108 --> 20:16.276
Oh, it's fine,
it's fine.

20:16.343 --> 20:18.912
And I mean,
you'll get me something right?

20:18.979 --> 20:20.914
Yeah, here,
can you hold her shoe?

20:20.981 --> 20:21.647
- The baby's shoe.
- I am starving.

20:21.714 --> 20:23.016
Oh, sure.

20:23.083 --> 20:24.418
Been running around
all day with this one.

20:24.483 --> 20:28.654
- Max had a meeting this morning.
- A meeting on a Sunday?

20:28.721 --> 20:29.856
What do you want,
a bagel or something?

20:29.923 --> 20:32.826
You know what
I'd love? Arugula.

20:32.893 --> 20:34.061
Ooh.

20:34.127 --> 20:36.731
Oh, it's rugelach,
not arugula.

20:36.798 --> 20:37.865
That's what she said.

20:37.932 --> 20:39.167
No,
that's not what she said.

20:39.233 --> 20:44.038
She said arugula and you
need your hearing checked.

20:44.105 --> 20:45.273
- My hearing is fine.
- Right.

20:45.340 --> 20:48.042
You just don't listen,
that's your problem.

20:51.746 --> 20:53.214
Hi!

20:53.281 --> 20:54.148
Oh my God.

20:55.283 --> 20:57.185
You look so gorgeous,
sweetheart.

20:57.251 --> 21:00.022
Oh my God, stop, please.
You look gorgeous.

21:00.089 --> 21:01.824
Why thank,
you. You're a grown woman.

21:01.890 --> 21:03.359
I know, yeah.

21:03.425 --> 21:05.693
Feels like just yesterday
you were the same age as Mason.

21:05.761 --> 21:07.129
It's crazy.

21:07.196 --> 21:09.664
I know, he's gonna be bar
mitzvahed later this year.

21:09.732 --> 21:10.733
I heard, yeah.

21:10.799 --> 21:12.067
I went and I
bought him a suit.

21:12.134 --> 21:16.038
I gotta show you this, wait
a minute, wait a minute.

21:17.672 --> 21:18.673
It's here somewhere.

21:18.741 --> 21:20.142
Oh, sorry.

21:20.209 --> 21:21.176
Ah.

21:21.243 --> 21:22.946
Now, look at it,
isn't this cute?

21:23.013 --> 21:25.048
Of course, it has to be tailored

21:25.115 --> 21:27.217
because he gained
a lot of weight.

21:27.283 --> 21:27.884
Oh.

21:34.824 --> 21:38.094
Shit.

23:38.853 --> 23:39.921
Coming.

23:39.988 --> 23:41.489
One sec, sorry.

23:41.556 --> 23:42.656
Just a minute.

24:01.810 --> 24:03.279
Sorry,
didn't mean to startle you,

24:03.345 --> 24:06.282
but is there an open
window or a fan inside?

24:06.348 --> 24:07.416
Great, thank you.

24:44.989 --> 24:45.856
Danielle?

24:47.091 --> 24:48.226
Hi.

24:48.292 --> 24:49.393
Hey, you.

24:50.461 --> 24:52.964
- You look stunning.
- Oh, thank you.

24:53.030 --> 24:54.532
Absolutely gorgeous.

24:54.599 --> 24:56.367
- Thanks.
- So, any boyfriends?

24:56.434 --> 24:58.804
No, not yet, or right now.

24:58.870 --> 25:01.440
You must be so excited
about graduating.

25:01.506 --> 25:05.244
Yeah, I mean like
I have some exams left

25:05.310 --> 25:08.313
and then I have some
interviews that I'm gonna do.

25:08.380 --> 25:10.382
Really? You didn't tell me.
Where?

25:10.449 --> 25:12.384
Well, I don't think
you know the places.

25:12.451 --> 25:15.053
Do you still make
those little videos?

25:15.120 --> 25:17.055
I always thought
those were so fun.

25:17.122 --> 25:17.923
I haven't done one in a while.

25:17.990 --> 25:20.292
So, acting is still your goal?

25:20.359 --> 25:23.196
No, it's like comedy,
stand-up.

25:23.263 --> 25:25.398
What was your major
again, sweetie?

25:25.465 --> 25:27.267
No no, she doesn't have
a major, Mom.

25:27.333 --> 25:30.603
She makes it up, but you
like got a diploma, right?

25:30.670 --> 25:32.872
I think
it was politics.

25:32.939 --> 25:34.841
Now I'm trying to think
if I know anybody.

25:34.907 --> 25:37.210
I always remember
you were such

25:37.277 --> 25:39.145
an humanitarian growing up.

25:39.212 --> 25:40.513
Yes.
You wanted to go on that trip

25:40.580 --> 25:45.151
and feed the homeless and
teach English in the Orient.

25:45.218 --> 25:47.488
My major was sort of
like women

25:47.554 --> 25:49.556
and gender studies
through the lens...

25:49.623 --> 25:52.860
Oh, so you could run marches
like with the pink pussy hats.

25:52.926 --> 25:55.562
Yes, exactly, that's
such a good idea, right?

25:55.629 --> 25:59.066
You love to march
and you love to knit.

25:59.133 --> 26:03.037
Our friend, Steve Epstein,
his son was like you.

26:03.103 --> 26:08.008
He was studying what,
philosophy or photography.

26:08.075 --> 26:09.543
One of those things.

26:09.610 --> 26:14.249
And his parents were terrified,
naturally, about his future.

26:14.316 --> 26:16.451
I mean, how's he going
to make any money?

26:16.518 --> 26:17.819
Right?

26:17.886 --> 26:21.956
But I mean, 20 years later,
he's a brain surgeon.

26:22.724 --> 26:24.125
You never know.

26:24.192 --> 26:25.527
Yeah, you never know.

26:27.562 --> 26:29.431
You may end up
being a brain surgeon.

26:29.497 --> 26:33.935
Yeah.

26:34.002 --> 26:35.404
Oh Sheila, I can do that.

26:35.471 --> 26:36.605
- What?
- I can take that for you.

26:36.672 --> 26:38.541
Oh, you are so lovely.
Thank you, darling.

26:38.607 --> 26:39.141
Eli vomited
all over the kids' room.

26:39.208 --> 26:40.309
It's okay.

26:40.376 --> 26:41.010
- It's a mess in there.
- Yeah, I got it.

26:41.077 --> 26:42.078
Okay, thank you.

26:42.144 --> 26:45.181
Perfect,
babysitter to the rescue.

26:45.247 --> 26:46.315
That's so sweet.

26:46.382 --> 26:47.283
You're a darling.

26:47.350 --> 26:48.384
- I can help you.
- It's fine.

26:48.451 --> 26:49.852
No, I want to.

26:51.053 --> 26:53.289
Such nice girls.

26:53.356 --> 26:54.490
Oh my God.

26:54.557 --> 26:56.926
Why do people even
bring kids to shivas?

26:56.992 --> 27:00.931
Here, let me help you. I
don't want to get it on you.

27:00.997 --> 27:01.898
Thanks.

27:03.433 --> 27:05.469
I was trying to build
an app for...

27:06.737 --> 27:09.206
Weren't you wearing
tights before?

27:09.272 --> 27:10.307
No.

27:10.374 --> 27:12.075
No?

27:12.142 --> 27:13.543
Wait, why are you bleeding?

27:14.711 --> 27:16.012
As you know, I...

27:17.180 --> 27:18.415
Really neat.

27:18.482 --> 27:20.951
It just got caught in
something, it's fine.

27:21.017 --> 27:23.421
Well, you have an
open wound on your leg.

27:24.188 --> 27:25.623
It's a scratch.

27:44.409 --> 27:46.177
Why do you keep
looking over there?

27:47.246 --> 27:50.616
- Where?
- At the skinny blonde woman.

27:51.583 --> 27:52.918
I'm not looking at her.

27:52.985 --> 27:56.655
Okay, she's very pretty,
but she's too old for you.

27:56.722 --> 28:00.559
I don't think
she's pretty.

28:02.661 --> 28:03.797
Malibu Barbie's not pretty?

28:03.863 --> 28:07.065
I mean she's just
like basic, y'know?

28:07.132 --> 28:10.336
Like she's just
like generic looking.

28:10.403 --> 28:11.772
She's like generic pretty.

28:11.839 --> 28:14.674
She's possibly the most
beautiful person I've ever seen

28:14.741 --> 28:15.975
Seriously?

28:16.042 --> 28:17.277
I just wouldn't be into
her is what I'm saying.

28:17.343 --> 28:19.679
She has like the essence
I want in 15 years.

28:19.746 --> 28:21.281
What,

28:21.347 --> 28:24.017
like boring?

28:24.617 --> 28:29.189
Boring wife who...

28:30.356 --> 28:34.361
doesn't have sex
and is like... mean.

28:34.428 --> 28:35.864
No, she's like
a hot businesswoman,

28:35.931 --> 28:39.768
basically a single mom, so
stressed out but you can't tell

28:39.835 --> 28:41.101
It's like, goals.

28:42.771 --> 28:45.105
- She's not a businesswoman.
- Yeah, she is.

28:45.172 --> 28:46.540
She's an entrepreneur.

28:46.607 --> 28:47.943
No, she's not.

28:48.008 --> 28:49.443
Yeah, my mom told me she
has like three businesses.

28:49.510 --> 28:50.678
But that's what I'm saying,

28:50.744 --> 28:53.180
you can't tell because
she's so chill about it.

28:55.249 --> 28:56.617
Why does she have three?

28:58.286 --> 28:59.488
Did they all just like fail?

28:59.554 --> 29:01.389
Okay, you're projecting
like a lot of misogyny

29:01.456 --> 29:03.658
for a future
woman's march organizer.

29:04.392 --> 29:05.560
What's goin' on?

29:05.627 --> 29:07.329
- What kinda company?
- It's like a stop-down.

29:07.395 --> 29:08.230
What's that?

29:08.296 --> 29:09.731
What kind of company was it?

29:09.799 --> 29:10.699
Excuse me.

29:12.667 --> 29:13.668
What are you?

29:13.735 --> 29:15.771
Nothing,
thank you for helping me.

29:19.674 --> 29:20.375
You're being so weird.

29:20.442 --> 29:22.278
I'm not being weird.

29:23.412 --> 29:26.249
- Hi, so good to see you.
- Hi, mazel tov.

29:26.315 --> 29:28.217
- Okay, yeah.
- Bye.

29:28.284 --> 29:29.085
Come here.

29:29.151 --> 29:31.687
What? Why are you dragging me?

29:31.755 --> 29:33.189
I thought you were
a vegetarian.

29:33.256 --> 29:36.225
I am, you said that, you
said that you wanted me to eat.

29:36.292 --> 29:39.095
Your behavior right now
is completely unacceptable.

29:39.161 --> 29:41.264
Okay, I think you
need to relax.

29:41.330 --> 29:42.632
Don't you tell me to relax.

29:42.698 --> 29:44.367
You are flirting with everyone.

29:44.433 --> 29:45.501
You are chugging wine.

29:45.568 --> 29:47.571
You are sitting on a table.

29:47.638 --> 29:49.039
What is this, a party?

29:50.407 --> 29:52.543
And I thought I told you no
funny business with Maya.

29:52.609 --> 29:53.510
I don't know what that means.

29:53.577 --> 29:54.244
Oh yes you do.

29:54.311 --> 29:55.412
Don't play dumb with me.

29:55.479 --> 29:57.648
I thought you were
done experimenting.

29:57.714 --> 29:59.550
You think everyone
that's bi is experimenting.

29:59.616 --> 30:02.119
You don't know anything.
You have zero gaydar.

30:02.185 --> 30:03.186
Excuse me, kid?

30:03.253 --> 30:04.756
I lived through New York
in the '80s.

30:04.822 --> 30:06.723
My gaydar is strong as a bull.

30:06.791 --> 30:08.659
- Look at this waist!
- Oh my God.

30:08.725 --> 30:11.129
Hi darling,
how was spin class?

30:11.195 --> 30:13.331
Oh, it was good,
but look at this one.

30:13.398 --> 30:14.365
Is she not eating?

30:14.432 --> 30:15.099
- Right?
- How much does she weigh?

30:15.166 --> 30:16.534
How much you weigh?

30:16.601 --> 30:18.303
Uh, I don't know.

30:18.369 --> 30:21.139
Oh, come on.

30:21.205 --> 30:22.574
Do you want me
to get on a scale?

30:22.640 --> 30:24.609
You're so funny,
look at this punum.

30:27.345 --> 30:27.745
You're okay.

30:28.948 --> 30:30.816
Who the fuck brings
a baby to a shiva?

30:30.883 --> 30:32.650
She doesn't know,
she's not Jewish.

30:32.717 --> 30:34.386
What do you mean, you
told me she converted?

30:34.453 --> 30:35.621
Converted, shmerted,

30:35.688 --> 30:37.456
she doesn't even know
how to say rugelach.

30:37.523 --> 30:38.324
You know what?

30:38.390 --> 30:40.492
I heard her dad was Jewish.

30:40.559 --> 30:42.294
That doesn't count.

30:42.361 --> 30:44.330
Anyway, she's very charming.

30:44.396 --> 30:47.333
They seem very happy,
very happy, sweet couple.

30:47.399 --> 30:48.802
She seems like a pill to me.

30:48.868 --> 30:50.703
She's very hard-working.

30:50.770 --> 30:52.806
Oh yeah, okay,
a hard-working pill.

30:52.872 --> 30:54.440
You know what
I don't understand?

30:54.506 --> 30:55.407
What?

30:55.474 --> 30:57.944
Nice Jewish boy
marries a shiksa

30:58.011 --> 31:00.781
when he could have any
wonderful woman here.

31:00.848 --> 31:02.749
Like look at
this beautiful girl.

31:02.817 --> 31:05.886
Right? Oh wait, wait,
sweetie, you got schmutz.

31:05.953 --> 31:07.554
- Stop.
- I'm just helping you.

31:07.621 --> 31:09.623
I'm just getting the
schmutz off your face.

31:09.689 --> 31:11.324
Anyway, the thing is

31:12.559 --> 31:15.195
- I think she's the breadwinner.
- The breadwinner.

31:15.261 --> 31:16.730
And where do you think
she got that money,

31:16.797 --> 31:18.866
maybe from his dad?

31:18.933 --> 31:19.332
Maury?

31:19.399 --> 31:20.433
Maury.

31:20.500 --> 31:21.368
Maury doesn't have
a pot to piss in.

31:21.434 --> 31:23.604
Oh, because he's so generous.

31:23.671 --> 31:25.339
Everybody knows
his business is kaput.

31:25.406 --> 31:26.641
But that's not his fault.

31:26.707 --> 31:29.644
That's not, oh, look
at you defending Maury.

31:29.710 --> 31:30.879
I forgot
you have a crush on him.

31:30.946 --> 31:33.214
- I don't have a crush on him.
- Oh yes you do.

31:33.280 --> 31:34.082
Don't be ridiculous.

31:34.148 --> 31:35.750
He was just very kind at a time.

31:35.817 --> 31:37.052
Oh, very kind, yes. Very kind.

31:37.119 --> 31:39.253
- At a time, it was difficult...
- A giant schlong.

31:39.320 --> 31:41.890
- Oh, stop it.
- He schtups like a champ.

31:41.957 --> 31:43.457
Oh, where did you hear that?

31:43.524 --> 31:44.191
- I'm sorry.
- Don't answer that.

31:44.258 --> 31:45.393
Where did you hear that?

31:45.459 --> 31:47.496
Don't answer, don't tell
me, but I'd like to know

31:47.562 --> 31:48.263
at a later date.

31:48.330 --> 31:49.498
Excuse me, darling,

31:49.564 --> 31:50.900
but I'm not gonna talk
about this anymore.

31:50.967 --> 31:53.235
- We can talk about it later.
- Thank you, thank you.

31:53.301 --> 31:55.370
Because the shiksa might
be able to get her a job.

31:55.437 --> 31:56.072
- Mom, no.
- Oh, a job?

31:56.139 --> 31:57.006
- Go.
- Mom.

31:57.073 --> 31:57.807
Of course, of course, go, go.

31:57.874 --> 31:59.942
Don't be shy, speak up.

32:00.009 --> 32:01.778
This is my daughter, Danielle.

32:01.844 --> 32:02.678
What's the matter?

32:02.744 --> 32:03.913
You wanna hold her, sweetie?

32:03.980 --> 32:05.547
You can calm her down,
you're a babysitter.

32:05.614 --> 32:06.949
Um, I'm okay.

32:07.016 --> 32:08.785
Somebody's very tired.

32:08.851 --> 32:10.453
You're good sport,
sweetie.

32:10.520 --> 32:11.889
Needs a nap.

32:11.955 --> 32:14.390
She needs
a little nappy nap.

32:14.457 --> 32:17.795
Well, everybody's
crying, it's a shiva.

32:17.861 --> 32:19.863
Hi, I'm Kim Beckett.

32:19.930 --> 32:21.731
Hi, nice to meet you.

32:21.799 --> 32:23.801
And that's Rose.

32:23.867 --> 32:27.537
Hey, that was you not
too long ago, sweetie.

32:27.603 --> 32:29.706
Danielle is about to graduate.

32:29.773 --> 32:30.908
Congratulations.

32:30.974 --> 32:32.810
Do you know what college
you're going to yet?

32:32.876 --> 32:34.545
I'm in college.

32:34.611 --> 32:35.947
Oh.

32:36.014 --> 32:36.647
Actually.

32:36.714 --> 32:38.215
Yeah, of course.

32:38.282 --> 32:43.520
So Joel was saying that maybe
you have a job offer for her?

32:43.587 --> 32:44.588
Yeah, we were
just telling Kim

32:44.655 --> 32:46.724
what a fantastic
babysitter you are.

32:46.791 --> 32:48.026
I'm looking for someone.

32:48.093 --> 32:51.062
I mean, might be good
to fill it in part time

32:51.129 --> 32:54.866
while you're looking
for whatever it is

32:54.933 --> 32:56.067
that you're gonna do.

32:56.134 --> 32:58.636
I mean, good babysitters
are so hard to find.

32:58.703 --> 32:59.270
It's impossible.

32:59.337 --> 33:00.773
It sure is.

33:00.840 --> 33:03.308
That's so nice of you to offer,
I'm actually fully booked.

33:03.374 --> 33:04.877
Sweetie, you've only
got one family, right?

33:04.944 --> 33:07.579
- It can't take that much time.
- How would you know that, Dad?

33:07.645 --> 33:09.481
You make your deposits
once a month,

33:09.547 --> 33:10.715
it's not rocket science.

33:10.783 --> 33:12.918
Why are you looking
into my account so much?

33:12.985 --> 33:15.353
Because they're ours,
sweetheart, that's why.

33:15.420 --> 33:18.991
Anyway, the point is
that I think Danielle

33:19.058 --> 33:22.328
was more interested
in an office job,

33:22.394 --> 33:24.898
like at your office
doing clerical work

33:24.965 --> 33:26.900
or something like that.

33:26.967 --> 33:29.970
I mean, you're such an
amazing entrepreneur.

33:30.036 --> 33:31.470
A real self-made woman.

33:31.537 --> 33:33.807
Yeah, it's fantastic, you've
got so many different things

33:33.874 --> 33:34.640
going on all at once.

33:34.707 --> 33:35.574
Terrific.

33:35.641 --> 33:37.643
I have to with his lifestyle.

33:37.710 --> 33:39.045
Really, that's funny.

33:39.112 --> 33:41.915
I never would have pegged
you for a man of luxury, Max.

33:41.982 --> 33:43.016
Oh, are you kidding me?

33:43.083 --> 33:44.985
Him and his friends
go to the most

33:45.051 --> 33:48.122
ridiculously expensive
restaurants, don't you?

33:48.189 --> 33:50.457
I mean, they're foodies.

33:51.725 --> 33:52.794
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.

33:52.860 --> 33:54.061
- Oh, could you get me one?
- Sure.

33:54.128 --> 33:57.364
So, I don't know, if
you change your mind,

33:57.430 --> 33:59.767
if you find yourself
with some time,

33:59.834 --> 34:01.936
I'm actually working
from home right now.

34:02.003 --> 34:04.038
But I really could use somebody

34:04.105 --> 34:07.374
to help with the organizing,
scheduling, things like that.

34:07.440 --> 34:09.576
I mean, we could really
tailor it to something

34:09.643 --> 34:13.048
that you like, if you
think that would suit you.

34:13.115 --> 34:14.917
- That'd be great.
- That sounds wonderful.

34:14.983 --> 34:18.086
Um, no, that's so nice
of you to offer, I just,

34:18.153 --> 34:20.923
I don't think that's
anything that I would like.

34:20.989 --> 34:24.525
I don't really wanna be
like a girl boss type of,

34:24.592 --> 34:25.894
that's not my thing.

34:28.163 --> 34:31.432
But it's very cool that
that's what you do.

34:31.499 --> 34:32.400
Right.

34:33.902 --> 34:38.842
That's so funny,
I have the same...

34:38.908 --> 34:40.676
...bracelet.

34:40.742 --> 34:42.611
- Really?
- Oh, neat.

34:43.712 --> 34:45.414
Would you look at that?

34:45.480 --> 34:46.548
You do, ah.

34:46.615 --> 34:48.818
I guess we both
have fabulous taste.

34:48.885 --> 34:51.020
Well, you and Max.

34:51.087 --> 34:53.589
I would say
it's a little bit extravagant.

34:53.655 --> 34:55.091
- Really?
- But um, that's him.

34:55.158 --> 34:56.425
Was it a special present?

34:56.491 --> 34:59.063
Was it for your high school
graduation or something?

34:59.129 --> 35:00.331
Yeah, I
think so, must have been.

35:00.396 --> 35:02.565
Yeah, something like that.

35:02.632 --> 35:03.633
- Sure.
- Yeah.

35:03.700 --> 35:05.135
Oh, I thought you
were in college.

35:05.202 --> 35:06.237
I am.

35:06.303 --> 35:09.439
It's just that
it's a new collection.

35:10.808 --> 35:12.776
Max, what are you
doing over there?

35:12.843 --> 35:14.744
Listen, if you guys
need a ride,

35:14.812 --> 35:16.046
I happen to have
the van outside.

35:16.113 --> 35:18.883
Sweetie, are you sure
we got you that bracelet?

35:18.949 --> 35:21.118
Yeah, I mean
I can't afford this.

35:22.053 --> 35:24.122
We can't afford it, either.

35:24.189 --> 35:26.858
Yeah, I'm pretty sure,
it must have been you.

35:26.925 --> 35:29.593
- It had to have been.
- I guess so.

35:29.660 --> 35:31.729
Shit.

35:31.796 --> 35:32.496
- Whoa.
- I'm sorry.

35:32.563 --> 35:33.899
Somebody's popular.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.000
- Busy guy.
- Work emails,

35:35.066 --> 35:36.433
getting them all at once.

35:36.500 --> 35:40.071
Seriously, the service in
here, it's terrible.

35:44.809 --> 35:45.844
- I got it.
- No no no, I got it.

35:49.181 --> 35:50.649
I'm so sorry.

35:50.715 --> 35:53.451
I'm sorry.

35:55.855 --> 35:57.189
Did any of it get on her?

35:57.256 --> 35:59.557
- She's okay, are you okay?
- It's okay, it's okay.

36:02.161 --> 36:04.063
Oh my God, are you okay?

36:04.130 --> 36:06.464
- Yeah.
- Oh sweetie, come with me.

36:08.134 --> 36:10.203
I know, I know, I know.

36:10.270 --> 36:14.074
I'm so so sorry,
is she all right?

36:14.141 --> 36:17.743
Well thank God Sheila's
coffee is always lukewarm

36:17.811 --> 36:19.980
or you'd have
third degree burns.

36:33.995 --> 36:36.197
Are we allowed to use that?

36:36.264 --> 36:38.665
This, oh God'll forgive us.

36:38.732 --> 36:40.201
It's too crazy in there.

36:44.339 --> 36:47.008
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to, it was...

36:47.075 --> 36:48.475
It happens.

36:55.682 --> 36:56.851
Mommy?

36:56.918 --> 36:58.253
Yeah, bubala?

37:01.957 --> 37:04.093
Are you disappointed in me?

37:05.995 --> 37:07.029
What?

37:08.763 --> 37:10.032
No.

37:10.099 --> 37:12.567
Um, sorry.

37:12.633 --> 37:13.902
Excuse me.

37:13.969 --> 37:16.071
Bye Gloria, see you next week.

37:21.243 --> 37:22.112
Danny,

37:24.948 --> 37:25.849
you're not?

37:28.318 --> 37:31.121
Sheila, I can help
you with these chairs.

37:31.187 --> 37:32.789
Oh, you're an angel.

37:32.856 --> 37:34.858
Sheila... okay.

37:34.924 --> 37:36.092
We were having a conversation.

37:36.159 --> 37:37.861
My cleaning lady
got the flu yesterday

37:37.927 --> 37:39.095
and it's just the worst timing.

37:39.162 --> 37:39.695
All right, all right.

37:39.762 --> 37:41.097
Thank you.

37:41.164 --> 37:43.266
If you can put 'em up
against that wall over there.

37:43.333 --> 37:44.200
Yeah.

38:01.819 --> 38:03.720
Hey, I can help you.

38:09.828 --> 38:11.229
- Thanks.
- Mm hm.

38:16.468 --> 38:17.701
Nice cum stain.

38:18.937 --> 38:21.840
Seriously, you need to
be less sensitive, okay?

38:22.441 --> 38:23.641
Excuse me.

38:23.707 --> 38:24.675
Wait, you need to
stop biting your nails.

38:24.742 --> 38:26.845
- It's so gross.
- Can you stop?

38:26.912 --> 38:28.180
This is so pretty.

38:28.246 --> 38:29.014
Where did you get it?

38:29.081 --> 38:30.215
I don't know.

38:30.282 --> 38:31.249
What do you
mean you don't know?

38:31.316 --> 38:33.185
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

38:33.251 --> 38:34.454
Wait, it's unclasped.

38:34.520 --> 38:36.688
Did you buy it with
your babysitting money?

38:36.755 --> 38:37.622
You're being a bitch.

38:37.689 --> 38:38.791
I'm not being a bitch.

38:38.858 --> 38:39.724
Hi.

38:40.893 --> 38:41.794
Hi.

38:42.795 --> 38:43.695
Hi, I'm Max.

38:44.430 --> 38:45.764
Maya.

38:45.832 --> 38:48.334
Are you Danielle's cousin
or sister or something?

38:48.401 --> 38:50.336
'Cause you guys
look really similar.

38:50.403 --> 38:51.703
Uh, no.

38:51.770 --> 38:53.973
But we do kinda look alike,
it's kinda fucked up.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.074
We grew up together.

38:55.141 --> 38:57.243
Oh, so kinda like family.

38:57.310 --> 38:59.079
I don't know,
we went to prom together.

38:59.146 --> 39:00.814
Oh, that's so sweet.

39:00.881 --> 39:03.083
It is so sweet, you're right.

39:03.150 --> 39:06.153
She was like late and
brought me a dead corsage.

39:06.220 --> 39:07.054
It wasn't dead.

39:07.121 --> 39:08.721
It was fully a dead flower.

39:09.990 --> 39:13.327
I feel like you two
had a really fun prom.

39:13.393 --> 39:14.995
You bet that we did, yeah.

39:15.062 --> 39:16.830
- We like caught a limo.
- Uh huh, yeah.

39:16.897 --> 39:18.165
You spiked the punch, puking

39:18.232 --> 39:19.199
everywhere
and like smokin' blunts.

39:19.266 --> 39:20.968
- And we like fucked.
- Maya!

39:21.034 --> 39:22.837
She had her first orgasm.

39:22.904 --> 39:24.272
What the fuck is wrong with you?

39:24.339 --> 39:25.940
What,
it was a night to remember.

39:26.007 --> 39:26.673
Ooh, sorry Mort.

39:26.740 --> 39:28.209
Mort, how are ya?

39:28.276 --> 39:30.245
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah.

39:30.311 --> 39:32.280
Just like sisters.

39:33.448 --> 39:35.383
Yeah, like a good
sister fucks her sister.

39:35.450 --> 39:36.618
What the hell?

39:36.683 --> 39:38.853
So, are you
in the arts, as well?

39:38.920 --> 39:41.055
Oh no, absolutely not.
I'm going to law school.

39:41.122 --> 39:43.892
Oh, you're the one
going to law school.

39:43.958 --> 39:45.794
As opp..., what do you know me?

39:45.861 --> 39:48.864
Danielle hasn't told us
what her post-grad plan is.

39:48.931 --> 39:51.000
Yeah I did, I said I
have interviews lined up.

39:51.066 --> 39:53.435
And some
other babysitting gigs?

39:54.470 --> 39:56.972
Or maybe you'd just be
sticking with the one?

39:57.039 --> 39:58.440
No, Danielle doesn't
need to work

39:58.507 --> 40:00.242
because her parents
pay for everything

40:00.309 --> 40:02.411
while she does her
like art thing.

40:02.478 --> 40:04.046
Really?

40:04.113 --> 40:06.348
You must be really in love
with this kid

40:08.217 --> 40:10.854
if you don't need
to be getting paid.

40:18.328 --> 40:19.596
I'm sorry, how do you
guys know each other?

40:19.663 --> 40:21.831
- Oh, we met in temple.
- We met at shul, yeah.

40:21.898 --> 40:23.033
Why?

40:23.099 --> 40:24.367
- You never go to temple.
- I go sometimes.

40:24.434 --> 40:27.070
So now you're just like
a deeply religious person?

40:27.137 --> 40:29.105
You can go without
being super religious.

40:29.172 --> 40:30.773
- You can be regular...
- Maya.

40:30.840 --> 40:32.042
...religious and go.

40:32.108 --> 40:33.443
Questionable.

40:33.510 --> 40:35.146
Maya?

40:35.213 --> 40:36.214
Oh, okay.

40:36.280 --> 40:38.049
Bye, nice to meet you.

40:45.523 --> 40:47.391
You're full of surprises today.

40:53.297 --> 40:54.832
So are we good?

40:58.937 --> 40:59.838
Yeah.

41:09.248 --> 41:10.115
Why wouldn't we be?

41:19.191 --> 41:21.326
So, have you seen
the new rabbi?

41:21.393 --> 41:24.597
If Robert De Niro and Gene
Kelly had a Jewish baby.

41:24.664 --> 41:26.399
Cute, so cute.

41:26.466 --> 41:27.533
For you cute
or for Danny cute?

41:27.600 --> 41:31.204
For all of us cute.
Cute is cute.

41:31.271 --> 41:33.306
But I want someone
good for Danny.

41:33.373 --> 41:34.507
Well, of course.

41:34.574 --> 41:36.276
And I'm trying to
find someone, it's just.

41:36.342 --> 41:37.910
- Hey.
- You're back.

41:40.046 --> 41:41.247
- Aw, so pretty.
- Hi, sweetie.

41:41.314 --> 41:42.382
Hi.

41:42.448 --> 41:44.284
So, are you
seeing anyone?

41:44.350 --> 41:46.620
No one we
wanna discuss right now.

41:46.687 --> 41:47.121
What?

41:48.489 --> 41:51.125
I thought you'd be swatting
the boys away like flies.

41:51.191 --> 41:54.028
Well I wish she would swat
them away a little harder.

41:54.094 --> 41:55.496
Uh, I swat.

41:55.562 --> 41:57.965
Don't listen to your mother.

41:58.032 --> 42:02.269
Have fun, enjoy, enjoy
this little, little body.

42:02.336 --> 42:04.938
I want her to enjoy
her little, little body,

42:05.005 --> 42:07.274
but get a vibrator,
don't get a relationship.

42:07.341 --> 42:08.008
Mom.

42:08.075 --> 42:09.109
It's not the same.

42:09.176 --> 42:11.313
I just want her
to finish her finals

42:11.379 --> 42:12.547
and meet someone after that.

42:12.614 --> 42:13.815
Of course, yeah.
That's true, it's true.

42:13.882 --> 42:17.118
Listen to your mother
and don't marry anyone

42:17.185 --> 42:20.255
'til you've slept with like
what? At least 10 people.

42:20.322 --> 42:22.290
Because you're gonna
end up with one

42:22.357 --> 42:24.059
and you'll be wiping
his arthritic ass

42:24.125 --> 42:25.493
for the rest of your life.

42:26.695 --> 42:28.530
You know
who I ran into recently

42:28.596 --> 42:30.932
whose son would be
perfect for her?

42:30.999 --> 42:32.067
Who did I run into?

42:32.133 --> 42:34.270
Danny, you know
that guy, tell her.

42:34.337 --> 42:35.371
Tell her.

42:36.405 --> 42:37.239
No, Mom, I don't want to.

42:37.306 --> 42:38.140
I have to go to the bathroom.

42:38.207 --> 42:39.909
- Oh.
- You tell her.

42:41.110 --> 42:42.345
I'm worried about her.

42:42.411 --> 42:43.245
- What are you worried about?
- I don't know.

42:43.312 --> 42:45.581
She's acting a little strange.

42:45.648 --> 42:49.051
- She is? A little different?
- Yeah, just off.

42:49.118 --> 42:50.119
Off?

42:50.186 --> 42:51.454
- Yeah, a little.
- Like distracted?

42:51.520 --> 42:53.489
- Like distracted.
- Distracted, but distracted.

42:53.556 --> 42:56.192
- It's treatable.
- Very distracted.

42:56.258 --> 42:58.061
- It's not a disease.
- That's true.

43:13.076 --> 43:15.145
Just a second.

43:24.322 --> 43:25.957
Sorry about that.

44:49.945 --> 44:51.245
Oh, what a day.

44:51.312 --> 44:53.047
Did you guys get enough to eat?

44:54.248 --> 44:55.249
How are you doing?

44:55.316 --> 44:57.051
You know,
it's just weird.

44:59.254 --> 45:01.122
Hey, Danny, sweetie.

45:02.424 --> 45:03.325
Are you okay?

45:03.391 --> 45:04.794
Yeah, can we go
like now please?

45:04.861 --> 45:08.096
Yeah, if you can drag your
father away from everybody.

45:08.163 --> 45:09.464
Okay, I'll do that.

45:09.531 --> 45:11.233
- Sweetie.
- What?

45:11.299 --> 45:12.734
Thank you for coming.

45:12.802 --> 45:15.437
Yeah, well you asked me
to be here, so whatever.

45:15.504 --> 45:18.206
I know, and I know it's not
something that you like to do.

45:18.273 --> 45:21.577
And, obviously, and I
just want you to know

45:21.644 --> 45:23.279
that I appreciate it, okay?

45:23.346 --> 45:24.113
You're welcome.

45:24.180 --> 45:25.849
You are such a good kid.

45:25.916 --> 45:26.749
Thanks.

45:26.817 --> 45:27.851
You are.

45:27.918 --> 45:29.218
How did I raise get
such a good girl?

45:29.285 --> 45:30.186
Mom.

45:30.253 --> 45:31.220
Are you on drugs?

45:31.287 --> 45:32.288
- No.
- Oh, I'm just kidding.

45:32.355 --> 45:34.858
No really,
you are such a good girl.

45:34.925 --> 45:37.393
I love you.

45:37.460 --> 45:38.728
I love you too, Mom.

45:38.795 --> 45:40.229
Oh my God.

45:40.296 --> 45:41.497
Wait a sec,

45:41.564 --> 45:43.499
I haven't had a chance
to catch up with you yet.

45:43.566 --> 45:44.634
How are you?

45:44.700 --> 45:47.170
Where did you go, Danielle?

45:47.237 --> 45:48.705
Where did you go?

45:48.772 --> 45:50.707
You're skin and
bones.

45:52.342 --> 45:53.811
- Yeah.
- What are you up to?

45:53.878 --> 45:56.814
Besides starving yourself
to death?

45:56.881 --> 45:57.748
Just...

45:59.583 --> 46:00.617
...studying.

46:00.684 --> 46:02.653
You have a boyfriend?

46:02.719 --> 46:04.521
- No.
- Ah, really?

46:04.588 --> 46:06.390
I don't believe you.

46:06.456 --> 46:08.559
I have nothing serious.

46:08.625 --> 46:12.664
So you just study
and don't eat

46:12.730 --> 46:15.633
and go out with your
beautiful friends, is that it?

46:15.700 --> 46:17.268
Is that your life?

46:17.335 --> 46:19.604
Yeah, I guess that's my life.

46:19.671 --> 46:22.206
Well, lucky you.

46:23.408 --> 46:24.309
Um.

46:25.677 --> 46:27.545
Can you, um, excuse me?

46:27.612 --> 46:30.315
I haven't eaten yet,
I have to go...

46:32.750 --> 46:34.420
unstarve myself.

46:36.622 --> 46:37.690
Excuse me.

46:44.330 --> 46:45.230
Excuse me.

46:47.867 --> 46:49.035
- Danielle.
- Yeah.

46:49.101 --> 46:51.337
- Um, I'm just gonna go.
- Oh, there you are.

46:52.638 --> 46:54.773
Um, I'm just gonna go.

47:13.526 --> 47:14.427
Hey.

47:24.772 --> 47:25.807
Are you okay?

47:29.410 --> 47:30.277
I'm like.

47:38.854 --> 47:39.754
What?

47:42.690 --> 47:43.724
Nothing.

47:43.791 --> 47:44.225
What, what is it?

47:44.291 --> 47:45.160
What?

47:45.227 --> 47:46.461
It's literally nothing, okay?

47:46.528 --> 47:48.363
Well you're laughing, so
what's so fucking funny?

47:48.430 --> 47:49.498
Nothing's fucking funny.

47:49.564 --> 47:50.699
Nothing's funny.

47:55.905 --> 47:56.806
Okay.

48:01.610 --> 48:03.178
I miss you, okay?

48:07.716 --> 48:11.721
And I was like
excited to see you.

48:13.991 --> 48:15.725
Great, whatever,
it's what a fuck.

48:15.792 --> 48:16.860
I'll fuck off.

48:17.760 --> 48:19.562
Okay, I miss you too.

48:19.629 --> 48:20.530
Sick.

48:21.464 --> 48:22.398
That's awesome.

48:22.465 --> 48:23.566
Cool, cool.

48:23.633 --> 48:24.434
Great, awesome.

48:25.969 --> 48:27.938
Well, I wouldn't know because
you literally never text me.

48:28.005 --> 48:30.808
That is simply not true,
I text you all the time.

48:30.874 --> 48:31.909
I didn't even know
you were coming today.

48:31.975 --> 48:33.010
Well you don't text
me either, so I.

48:33.077 --> 48:35.612
I replied
to your fucking story

48:35.679 --> 48:36.680
and you just like saw it.

48:36.747 --> 48:38.049
You do not reply
to a reply, okay?

48:38.116 --> 48:39.550
Well, you should.

48:39.616 --> 48:42.419
That's psychotic behavior,
but that makes sense for you.

48:42.486 --> 48:43.787
Why don't you fucking reach out?

48:43.855 --> 48:44.688
I just told you that I did.

48:44.755 --> 48:46.057
I told you that I reached out.

48:46.124 --> 48:48.059
Okay, why didn't you
just call me like an adult?

48:48.126 --> 48:49.293
Nobody calls, so.

48:49.359 --> 48:50.929
Well, grow up.

48:51.762 --> 48:54.866
Be different than other people.

49:19.158 --> 49:20.458
Okay, cool.

49:20.525 --> 49:22.428
I'll see you later.

49:40.412 --> 49:43.817
- Look, she's eating.
- Oh look, she's eating!

49:52.626 --> 49:53.895
You can go ahead.

50:36.840 --> 50:37.941
Uh huh.

50:38.007 --> 50:40.877
It was Lucy's graduation
present from me.

50:40.944 --> 50:42.778
Aw, that's so sweet.

50:42.846 --> 50:45.982
That's really nice. Can I see?

50:47.716 --> 50:50.053
Oh, you guys are
at the Holocaust Museum.

50:51.720 --> 50:53.089
You look so...

50:53.156 --> 50:54.423
happy.

51:03.968 --> 51:05.435
I'm just wondering.

51:07.171 --> 51:08.038
Uh huh.

51:09.672 --> 51:10.640
How old is she?

51:13.043 --> 51:15.946
- Oh, she's 18 months.
- Mm hm.

51:20.919 --> 51:24.788
You two know each other
because of your parents?

51:24.856 --> 51:26.457
Yeah.

51:26.523 --> 51:27.424
No.

51:30.561 --> 51:31.462
No?

51:37.534 --> 51:38.870
We met at shul.

51:38.937 --> 51:40.471
Yeah, shul.

51:42.908 --> 51:46.678
Ah.

51:46.745 --> 51:47.512
Or did we?

51:51.650 --> 51:53.119
I can't remember.

51:53.185 --> 51:56.421
And this is us in
Israel at Mason's bar mitzvah.

51:57.622 --> 52:01.160
I mean Israel, Palestine,
whatever they're calling it now

52:01.227 --> 52:02.261
I don't know.

52:02.328 --> 52:04.163
- That's a nice photo.
- You think?

52:04.964 --> 52:06.032
- I love it.
- Danielle.

52:06.098 --> 52:08.000
Danielle, listen,
can you call my phone?

52:08.067 --> 52:09.769
I lost it,
I can't find it anywhere.

52:09.836 --> 52:10.971
Yeah, sure.

52:13.240 --> 52:15.508
Shit, I don't have my phone.

52:15.574 --> 52:18.644
Great, nevermind
I'll ask your mother.

52:18.711 --> 52:20.180
Deb.

52:20.247 --> 52:20.847
Deb.

52:47.342 --> 52:50.211
SUGAR APP: WHAT KIND OF
ARRANGEMENT ARE YOU INTERESTED IN?

52:50.278 --> 52:53.147
SUGAR APP: BigDaddy481
VIEWED YOUR PROFILE

53:15.904 --> 53:17.106
You have
a fakakta memory.

53:17.172 --> 53:18.273
You keep losing everything.

53:18.340 --> 53:19.807
So, maybe
I do have dementia.

53:19.875 --> 53:23.113
Yeah, you've had
dementia since our wedding day.

53:23.179 --> 53:24.713
Anybody can forget
a ring, you know.

53:24.780 --> 53:25.781
It's not such a big deal.

53:25.849 --> 53:26.682
You know what,
look for your own phone.

53:26.749 --> 53:29.019
It's probably by the desserts.

53:29.085 --> 53:30.153
Thank you.

53:35.425 --> 53:36.259
Hey.

53:36.326 --> 53:36.993
Hi.

53:38.061 --> 53:39.695
Have you seen my phone?

53:39.762 --> 53:40.796
No.

53:40.864 --> 53:42.999
Shoot, I'm looking
'cause I'm...

53:43.066 --> 53:45.136
I'm trying to find it
because I need it right now.

53:45.202 --> 53:47.071
Why do you need it right now?

53:48.339 --> 53:52.009
I just like told someone
that I met here

53:52.076 --> 53:53.277
that I would send
them my resume.

53:53.344 --> 53:56.914
Oh, feels like you have
so many job prospects.

53:56.981 --> 53:59.150
I'm sure you can find
more here, y'know?

54:01.385 --> 54:04.121
Okay,
so you haven't seen it or?

54:04.188 --> 54:06.623
I don't know,
I might have seen it,

54:06.689 --> 54:10.295
like in the kitchen
or in the bathroom.

54:10.362 --> 54:14.632
But y'know, it was unlocked.

54:18.170 --> 54:19.703
So you might wanna find it

54:21.306 --> 54:23.208
before like somebody else does.

54:26.945 --> 54:29.281
Oh Danielle, I need your
help. I'm running out of lox.

54:29.347 --> 54:31.749
- One second. Maya...
- Get the fuck off me.

54:32.716 --> 54:35.587
Please don't tell anyone.
Please.

54:36.189 --> 54:40.159
Danielle, I love your parents.

54:45.198 --> 54:46.065
I just wouldn't
want them to know

54:46.132 --> 54:48.134
their daughter's
a fuckin' whore.

54:55.740 --> 54:57.845
Danielle, the
lox is in the kitchen.

54:57.911 --> 54:58.811
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

55:44.092 --> 55:45.294
Danielle!

55:45.361 --> 55:46.862
Jerry clogged the toilet again

55:46.929 --> 55:48.663
and the place smells like shit.

55:52.368 --> 55:54.036
Bubala,
where you running off to?

55:54.103 --> 55:56.906
Look at this baby, so adorable.

55:56.972 --> 55:58.340
Sleeping like a baby.

55:58.407 --> 56:00.075
Tears of gold, this baby cries.

56:00.142 --> 56:01.844
Listen, sweetie, you
don't have to worry.

56:01.911 --> 56:03.145
I found my phone,

56:03.212 --> 56:04.380
you don't have to think
about looking for it.

56:04.446 --> 56:05.581
She was never
worried about your phone.

56:05.648 --> 56:08.317
How long have
you guys been together?

56:08.384 --> 56:10.353
Almost five years.

56:10.420 --> 56:11.154
Mm hm.

56:11.221 --> 56:12.989
And how did you meet?

56:13.056 --> 56:14.024
Online.

56:14.090 --> 56:15.125
Mm hm.

56:15.192 --> 56:17.793
You're very curious,
aren't you?

56:17.861 --> 56:21.264
I'm just wondering how
female entrepreneurs do it all.

56:21.331 --> 56:24.834
Well, they need
a great support system.

56:26.169 --> 56:28.171
Right, you need a
husband who's supportive

56:28.238 --> 56:30.773
of young female entrepreneurs.

56:30.840 --> 56:32.209
Right.

56:32.275 --> 56:37.381
I'm surprised you're able
to work from home, y'know?

56:38.082 --> 56:39.317
Where do you live again?

56:39.383 --> 56:41.452
I mean we've always
had the Soho apartment.

56:41.519 --> 56:42.620
Soho.

56:42.687 --> 56:43.487
Because how could
we let go of that,

56:43.554 --> 56:46.390
it's just the best location.

56:46.457 --> 56:50.394
But a few months ago, we
got the house out here.

56:50.461 --> 56:55.299
Just seemed like
the logical next step,

56:55.366 --> 56:58.103
especially if we're
gonna have another kid.

56:58.170 --> 56:59.071
Baby!

57:00.339 --> 57:01.573
Another wonderful baby.

57:01.640 --> 57:02.807
Wonderful.

57:02.874 --> 57:04.009
I wish I could have
my own bachelor pad

57:04.076 --> 57:07.812
where I could do whatever
the fuck I wanted.

57:08.647 --> 57:09.081
- Hey.
- What?

57:09.147 --> 57:09.814
Danielle.

57:09.881 --> 57:11.350
What are you doing?

57:11.416 --> 57:13.185
She's just teasing,

57:13.252 --> 57:15.954
she's got such a crazy
sense of humor sometimes.

57:17.122 --> 57:18.190
Are you drunk?

57:18.257 --> 57:22.262
Do you have a boyfriend
or girlfriend?

57:22.328 --> 57:24.264
- Well, girlfriend.
- No girlfriends.

57:24.330 --> 57:26.966
- Please.
- Experimented, but.

57:27.900 --> 57:28.767
No, no.

57:29.736 --> 57:31.871
It's just so hard
in my generation

57:31.938 --> 57:35.308
because there's just
weird unconventional ways

57:35.375 --> 57:35.942
of meeting people.

57:36.009 --> 57:37.043
Sure, sure.

57:37.110 --> 57:38.978
Like in apps
and stuff like that.

57:39.045 --> 57:41.247
Oh darling, what are you so?

57:41.314 --> 57:43.149
Of course you're gonna
find somebody soon.

57:43.216 --> 57:46.120
Listen, Jdate has been
fantastic for me.

57:46.186 --> 57:47.388
Have you tried JSwipe?

57:47.454 --> 57:50.357
A little bit of lipstick,
a little bit of lipstick.

57:50.424 --> 57:52.393
Oh, I always tell her
that about the lipstick.

57:52.459 --> 57:53.927
You know what,
sweetheart?

57:53.994 --> 57:56.630
I'm absolutely convinced it's
gonna be much much easier now.

57:56.697 --> 57:59.967
She had kind of an extended
awkward phase, you know?

58:00.034 --> 58:02.636
She had the braces and
she was kinda chubby

58:02.703 --> 58:03.737
for quite a while.

58:03.803 --> 58:05.239
- No.
- A little chubby.

58:05.306 --> 58:06.006
Oh, you were so cute.

58:06.073 --> 58:07.441
There was this boy,

58:07.508 --> 58:09.978
she had a thing for him
forever, for the longest time.

58:10.045 --> 58:11.379
His name was Michael, right?

58:11.446 --> 58:15.283
And she asked him to the
dance, and I guess he said no.

58:15.350 --> 58:18.887
Then like everybody at
school knew and saw.

58:18.953 --> 58:20.889
And I picked her up,
it was so sweet,

58:20.955 --> 58:21.990
the whole ride home,

58:22.057 --> 58:23.258
there were these
little tears coming down.

58:23.325 --> 58:26.161
I felt bad, but y'know,
like she's my baby,

58:26.227 --> 58:27.962
but everybody goes through it.

58:28.029 --> 58:30.231
- It'll happen to your girl.
- Such a cutie.

58:30.298 --> 58:32.434
Remember the song
we used to sing her?

58:32.501 --> 58:33.369
Of course.

58:34.370 --> 58:35.137
- Baby shake.
- Baby shake

58:35.204 --> 58:36.505
When she was Rose's age,

58:36.572 --> 58:40.676
we used to sing the baby
shake song whenever she cried.

58:40.743 --> 58:42.978
That's what we should
have been doing with Rose.

58:43.045 --> 58:45.581
- ♪ Let's make a baby shake ♪
- Stop

58:45.648 --> 58:49.919
- ♪ Let's make a baby shake ♪
- Please stop, Mom.

58:49.985 --> 58:52.321
- ♪ Let's make a baby shake ♪
- Mom.

58:52.388 --> 58:54.023
- Can you let go?
- No, never.

58:54.090 --> 58:55.124
Everybody let go.

58:55.191 --> 58:56.192
Never.

58:56.258 --> 58:57.260
Stop.

58:57.327 --> 58:58.061
Stop!

58:58.128 --> 58:59.463
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

58:59.529 --> 59:01.164
- Whoa.
- Let go.

59:02.099 --> 59:03.533
Danny, just take it easy.

59:03.600 --> 59:05.535
Everything's okay, it's okay.

59:05.602 --> 59:08.038
Yeah, just go go go go.

59:08.105 --> 59:09.172
I'm gonna talk to her.

59:11.475 --> 59:12.743
I know you don't
believe in me,

59:12.809 --> 59:14.544
I know that you think that
I'm not gonna do anything

59:14.611 --> 59:17.347
and you think that
I'm a little baby.

59:17.414 --> 59:19.616
I don't think that
you're a little baby.

59:22.286 --> 59:23.688
Oh my God.

59:23.755 --> 59:25.390
Thank you
very much for joining me

59:25.456 --> 59:29.293
and the Feldmans in
their time of mourning.

59:29.360 --> 59:32.964
If you would please join me in
reciting the mourner's kaddish.

1:00:40.668 --> 1:00:42.570
Thank you very much.

1:00:54.248 --> 1:00:55.149
Hey.

1:00:55.683 --> 1:00:57.552
Hey hey hey hey hey.

1:00:57.619 --> 1:00:59.154
Stop, stop, stop.

1:00:59.221 --> 1:01:00.121
What?

1:01:04.159 --> 1:01:05.760
You know, I think,

1:01:07.496 --> 1:01:10.999
I think it would be best
if we ended this.

1:01:14.871 --> 1:01:16.638
Sure, yeah.

1:01:17.572 --> 1:01:19.374
We probably should
before your wife

1:01:19.441 --> 1:01:22.211
runs out of money.

1:01:22.278 --> 1:01:24.347
Is there a second bathroom?

1:01:24.413 --> 1:01:26.682
Someone is taking
forever in this one.

1:01:27.583 --> 1:01:30.353
Um, I think
there's one upstairs.

1:01:30.419 --> 1:01:31.420
You gotta speak up.

1:01:31.487 --> 1:01:33.789
There's another
bathroom upstairs.

1:01:33.857 --> 1:01:37.260
Forget it,
I'll wait til I'm home.

1:01:38.929 --> 1:01:40.196
Excuse me.

1:01:42.665 --> 1:01:44.668
I think we should
get going soon.

1:01:50.274 --> 1:01:51.174
Sure.

1:02:14.198 --> 1:02:15.099
Sorry.

1:02:23.775 --> 1:02:26.177
Dad, can we go please?

1:02:26.244 --> 1:02:29.247
Yeah, sure we can.
Just go ask your mother.

1:02:31.850 --> 1:02:32.919
Mom, can we go now?

1:02:32.986 --> 1:02:35.654
Sweetie, I'm talking
to the rabbi.

1:02:35.721 --> 1:02:38.657
Don't be rude.
But yes, we can go.

1:02:38.724 --> 1:02:39.758
You wanna take these books back

1:02:39.825 --> 1:02:43.762
and we'll get going soon,
don't worry.

1:02:50.536 --> 1:02:51.437
Hey, Danielle.

1:02:53.606 --> 1:02:55.240
Is this yours?

1:02:59.646 --> 1:03:01.181
Um,

1:03:01.247 --> 1:03:02.482
yeah.

1:03:02.549 --> 1:03:04.117
I found it in the bathroom.

1:03:06.686 --> 1:03:08.856
Thanks, thank you.

1:03:08.923 --> 1:03:10.323
Yeah.

1:03:10.390 --> 1:03:11.391
Can I borrow you for a second?

1:03:12.792 --> 1:03:17.230
She's really hungry and I
need an extra pair of hands.

1:03:20.801 --> 1:03:21.836
Can you hold her?

1:03:24.372 --> 1:03:25.539
You really want me to?

1:03:25.606 --> 1:03:26.474
I just need you to
hold her for a second,

1:03:26.540 --> 1:03:28.476
I've got some stuff in the bag.

1:03:28.542 --> 1:03:30.846
And it'd be very helpful.

1:03:30.912 --> 1:03:33.481
Um, I shouldn't, y'know?

1:03:33.547 --> 1:03:34.415
Why?

1:03:35.750 --> 1:03:37.886
You're a babysitter, right?

1:03:37.953 --> 1:03:40.321
Uh, we're gonna go in a sec.

1:03:40.388 --> 1:03:41.756
Your parents are still here.

1:03:41.822 --> 1:03:43.892
You're leaving with them,
aren't you?

1:03:43.959 --> 1:03:47.763
I really only work with
like eight year olds.

1:03:47.829 --> 1:03:50.298
Well it's not brain surgery.

1:03:52.801 --> 1:03:53.903
Just hold her.

1:03:56.438 --> 1:03:57.339
Um.

1:03:58.473 --> 1:03:59.876
It's fine, you'll be fine.

1:04:19.063 --> 1:04:20.496
- Let me, let me take her.
- It's okay.

1:04:20.563 --> 1:04:21.264
Can you call a car?

1:04:21.330 --> 1:04:22.198
Yeah, I can do that.

1:04:22.265 --> 1:04:23.067
Honestly, can you call a car?

1:04:23.133 --> 1:04:24.168
Yeah, but I can do both.

1:04:24.233 --> 1:04:25.903
- I just need the...
- It's fine, she's fine.

1:04:25.969 --> 1:04:26.502
Just call the car first.

1:04:26.569 --> 1:04:27.570
I can do both.

1:04:27.637 --> 1:04:28.172
I'd like you
to call the car.

1:04:29.139 --> 1:04:31.474
She's a babysitter, remember?

1:04:31.541 --> 1:04:32.977
- Yeah, I do remember.
- What is the matter with you?

1:04:33.044 --> 1:04:33.577
Honestly.

1:04:33.644 --> 1:04:34.278
Give her back!

1:04:49.526 --> 1:04:50.895
That's 40 years of fasting.

1:04:50.962 --> 1:04:52.296
That's more like 200.

1:04:58.871 --> 1:05:00.405
No no no, you don't
have to worry about that.

1:05:00.472 --> 1:05:02.273
Can we get a broom, please?

1:05:03.641 --> 1:05:04.542
Danny.

1:05:12.617 --> 1:05:14.019
Sweetie.

1:05:14.086 --> 1:05:15.353
Danielle, stop.

1:05:18.623 --> 1:05:19.390
I'm sorry.

1:05:20.526 --> 1:05:22.028
What are you doing?

1:05:23.096 --> 1:05:24.530
Danny, stop.

1:05:24.597 --> 1:05:25.798
Come on.

1:05:25.866 --> 1:05:26.967
What are you doing?

1:05:28.801 --> 1:05:30.603
What's goin' on, sweetie?

1:05:30.669 --> 1:05:32.838
Bubala, bubala, talk to me.

1:05:33.606 --> 1:05:34.573
I can't.

1:05:34.640 --> 1:05:35.674
Talk to me, talk to me.

1:05:35.741 --> 1:05:36.842
You can't what?

1:05:37.710 --> 1:05:38.711
I can't.

1:05:38.778 --> 1:05:41.915
- I can't.
- You can't what, Danielle?

1:05:41.982 --> 1:05:42.883
What?

1:05:45.585 --> 1:05:47.420
What, honey?

1:05:50.657 --> 1:05:51.893
I don't know.

1:05:51.959 --> 1:05:53.895
Oh baby, you don't
need to know

1:05:53.961 --> 1:05:55.129
what you're doing right now.

1:05:55.196 --> 1:05:57.631
- No, I don't know.
- You don't need to know.

1:05:57.697 --> 1:05:59.967
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

1:06:00.034 --> 1:06:02.502
Everything's gonna be fine.

1:06:02.569 --> 1:06:04.939
You're gonna get a great job,

1:06:05.006 --> 1:06:09.912
you're gonna meet a great man,
you're gonna fall in love.

1:06:10.846 --> 1:06:12.513
Just,
you're gonna figure it out.

1:06:12.580 --> 1:06:14.149
Listen, worst case scenario,

1:06:14.216 --> 1:06:16.484
you can move back
in with Daddy and me.

1:06:16.551 --> 1:06:17.585
No.

1:06:26.727 --> 1:06:28.763
Everybody, looky-loos.

1:06:28.830 --> 1:06:29.865
Are you okay?

1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:33.635
Just too pushy, isn't she?

1:06:34.636 --> 1:06:35.437
What is wrong with you?

1:06:35.504 --> 1:06:37.006
Thank you, Maya.

1:06:38.473 --> 1:06:39.474
You know what?

1:06:40.776 --> 1:06:41.945
I'm gonna go get Daddy,

1:06:42.011 --> 1:06:44.613
have him bring the car
around for us, okay?

1:06:46.015 --> 1:06:47.951
You just get outta here by going

1:06:48.017 --> 1:06:49.953
and helping Mrs. Bronstein.

1:06:50.019 --> 1:06:51.753
Yeah, and I can help too.

1:06:51.820 --> 1:06:53.622
Thank you. Thank you, Maya.

1:06:53.689 --> 1:06:55.993
All right, you wanna gonna go?

1:06:56.060 --> 1:06:57.962
Don't you worry
about anybody here.

1:06:58.028 --> 1:07:00.730
They all love you.
It's a sad day, y'know?

1:07:00.797 --> 1:07:03.466
It's a sad day, lot of sadness.

1:07:03.533 --> 1:07:04.634
Everybody feels it.

1:07:13.043 --> 1:07:15.478
Mrs. Bronstein,
which one is your car?

1:07:15.545 --> 1:07:16.713
You'll see in a minute.

1:07:23.121 --> 1:07:25.056
Can I ask you something?

1:07:25.891 --> 1:07:26.925
What?

1:07:28.293 --> 1:07:29.928
Why do you do it?

1:07:31.363 --> 1:07:33.497
- I'm not judging or anything.
- I mean, you clearly are.

1:07:33.564 --> 1:07:35.599
No I'm not,
I just don't know anything

1:07:35.666 --> 1:07:36.734
- about it, so.
- I wanted money

1:07:36.800 --> 1:07:37.735
and it was easy.

1:07:39.737 --> 1:07:40.638
Was it?

1:07:41.572 --> 1:07:43.141
Yeah, sometimes.

1:07:43.208 --> 1:07:48.513
Felt nice to like have
power and be appreciated.

1:07:49.648 --> 1:07:52.550
If you could just put
those in the front seat, hm?

1:07:55.888 --> 1:07:56.755
Thanks.

1:08:00.725 --> 1:08:01.826
Do you need help?

1:08:01.894 --> 1:08:04.063
Oh no, thanks girls.

1:08:04.130 --> 1:08:05.965
Do you want me
to pull out for you?

1:08:06.032 --> 1:08:07.832
You drive a car?

1:08:07.900 --> 1:08:10.103
Yeah, I think
I'm a pretty good driver.

1:08:10.836 --> 1:08:12.571
Oh, thank you, no.

1:08:13.706 --> 1:08:15.574
All right, be safe.

1:08:18.879 --> 1:08:20.780
Wait, doesn't she
have an expired license?

1:08:20.846 --> 1:08:21.915
Yeah, they took it away.

1:08:21.982 --> 1:08:24.784
She's not supposed to.

1:08:24.851 --> 1:08:25.718
Whatever.

1:08:33.593 --> 1:08:34.929
Hey, I'm really sorry.

1:08:34.996 --> 1:08:36.030
It's fine.

1:08:38.665 --> 1:08:40.734
I just never thought
about it that way.

1:08:41.936 --> 1:08:43.237
No, get in, Maureen.

1:08:43.304 --> 1:08:44.604
Danielle.

1:08:44.671 --> 1:08:45.239
What?

1:08:45.306 --> 1:08:46.441
You coming?

1:08:46.506 --> 1:08:47.808
I'm literally
walking towards you, Dad.

1:08:47.875 --> 1:08:50.979
Sweetie, get over here
before somebody sees the car.

1:08:51.045 --> 1:08:52.080
Where were you?

1:08:52.146 --> 1:08:53.414
I was looking all over.

1:08:53.480 --> 1:08:56.251
We were helping Mrs.
Bronstein to her car, Mom.

1:08:56.318 --> 1:08:56.751
Why?

1:08:56.818 --> 1:08:58.053
Why?

1:08:58.120 --> 1:08:59.321
Because you're supposed to
help fuckin' old people,

1:08:59.388 --> 1:09:00.289
I don't know.

1:09:00.356 --> 1:09:01.390
Don't you dare
use that language

1:09:01.457 --> 1:09:02.590
or that tone with me,
young lady.

1:09:02.657 --> 1:09:05.194
Katherine, Maya,
you guys need a ride?

1:09:05.260 --> 1:09:07.229
No, that's okay.
We'll get a car.

1:09:07.296 --> 1:09:09.231
- Oh good.
- Come on, we got an open van.

1:09:09.298 --> 1:09:12.034
It's fine, Mom, they
live two seconds from us.

1:09:16.171 --> 1:09:19.074
Make sure you
get one with a car seat.

1:09:20.176 --> 1:09:21.777
No,
it's finding nearby drivers.

1:09:21.844 --> 1:09:23.779
Of course, Jesus Christ.

1:09:25.281 --> 1:09:27.250
Hey, aren't we
giving you two a lift?

1:09:27.317 --> 1:09:28.151
Uh, three.

1:09:29.019 --> 1:09:30.353
- No.
- Oh no, it's.

1:09:30.420 --> 1:09:31.787
No, it's okay, we're getting
a car, so. But thank you.

1:09:31.855 --> 1:09:35.959
Come on, I got the Uber
that's Uber-all-this, let's go.

1:09:36.026 --> 1:09:38.294
Joel, they got a car.

1:09:38.361 --> 1:09:39.595
We got Maureen.

1:09:39.661 --> 1:09:40.363
And he's right around
the corner, he's at...

1:09:40.430 --> 1:09:41.464
My phone just died.

1:09:41.530 --> 1:09:44.268
Okay. We'll use my phone.

1:09:44.335 --> 1:09:45.735
- Well, where is it?
- Just look, it's somewhere in here.

1:09:45.802 --> 1:09:48.372
- Okay, that's very specific.
- It's somewhere in there.

1:09:48.439 --> 1:09:52.609
Honestly, you guys have so
many people between all of you

1:09:52.675 --> 1:09:55.246
and we would have to strap her
in and all of those things.

1:09:55.312 --> 1:09:57.281
When we were all her
age, there was no straps,

1:09:57.348 --> 1:09:59.383
there was no carriers.
Everybody all survived.

1:09:59.450 --> 1:10:00.717
Come with us.

1:10:00.784 --> 1:10:04.155
Oh, for the love God.
I'm getting in the car.

1:10:04.989 --> 1:10:08.326
Sure.

1:10:08.393 --> 1:10:10.028
Are you fucking kidding me?

1:10:10.095 --> 1:10:12.663
Youngest in first. You
guys to the backy back.

1:10:12.730 --> 1:10:13.697
- Seriously?
- Come on.

1:10:13.764 --> 1:10:14.665
Okay.

1:10:17.302 --> 1:10:20.372
Wait, sorry, you gotta lift
up the middle seat. I forgot.

1:10:20.439 --> 1:10:21.306
All right.

1:10:22.507 --> 1:10:23.641
You have to pull the lever.

1:10:23.707 --> 1:10:24.876
I'm literally
pulling the lever.

1:10:24.943 --> 1:10:27.578
- Do you want me to do it?
- No, I got it.

1:10:27.645 --> 1:10:30.982
Come on, Maya, you
gotta use some muscle, y'know?

1:10:31.049 --> 1:10:32.584
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1:10:33.352 --> 1:10:35.821
Okay, who's next?
Kim, Max?

1:10:36.855 --> 1:10:38.291
- You go first.
- Okay.

1:10:40.725 --> 1:10:42.028
Terrific.

1:10:42.095 --> 1:10:44.931
Katherine, you think you can
fit in on that same seat?

1:10:44.997 --> 1:10:45.831
Here we are.

1:10:45.898 --> 1:10:46.999
Thank you.

1:10:47.066 --> 1:10:48.301
Scoot over.

1:10:48.367 --> 1:10:51.404
Okay, last one is Maureen.

1:10:53.005 --> 1:10:54.207
Oh no.

1:10:54.273 --> 1:10:55.808
Shit, I think I might
have overbooked us.

1:10:55.876 --> 1:10:56.877
No shit.

1:10:56.944 --> 1:10:58.145
Seriously,
we can honestly get out.

1:10:58.212 --> 1:10:58.912
Yeah, we can just get a
car. It's not a big deal.

1:10:58.979 --> 1:11:01.115
No no no no, listen.

1:11:01.181 --> 1:11:02.282
Maureen, you get there
in the backy back.

1:11:02.349 --> 1:11:04.817
And then Maya and Danielle,

1:11:04.885 --> 1:11:06.420
can you guys squeeze
together into one seat?

1:11:06.487 --> 1:11:08.055
I mean,
you're pretty small, right?

1:11:08.122 --> 1:11:10.124
Really, Joel,
we could take a car.

1:11:10.190 --> 1:11:12.392
No no no, this is
gonna work. Believe me.

1:11:12.459 --> 1:11:15.362
I promise you no man left
behind, or woman, sorry.

1:11:15.429 --> 1:11:17.464
You okay back there, Maureen?

1:11:18.731 --> 1:11:20.869
You got a lot of
stuff back here, Joel.

1:11:21.903 --> 1:11:22.570
Hi, girls.

1:11:22.636 --> 1:11:23.872
- Hey.
- Hi.

1:11:23.938 --> 1:11:25.974
Got your legs around?
Everybody hands safe?

1:11:26.040 --> 1:11:27.976
- I know, I know.
- All in.

1:11:32.914 --> 1:11:34.315
Off like a herd of turtles.

1:11:34.382 --> 1:11:35.984
- What the?
- No, it's okay.

1:11:36.050 --> 1:11:37.085
It's okay.

1:11:37.152 --> 1:11:38.887
All right.

1:11:44.126 --> 1:11:45.727
Hi, baby.

1:11:45.793 --> 1:11:49.999
You wanna play
peek a book? Peek a boo.

1:11:50.065 --> 1:11:50.966
Don't cry.

1:11:52.001 --> 1:11:54.769
All set? Seatbelts on?

1:11:55.837 --> 1:11:58.874
All right, first stop
will be Maureen.

1:11:58.941 --> 1:12:00.309
Oh, thank you.

1:12:01.477 --> 1:12:03.012
Oh shit.

1:12:03.078 --> 1:12:03.979
Oh no.

1:12:06.814 --> 1:12:08.817
You don't
have your phone, again?

1:12:09.586 --> 1:12:10.719
I got it.

1:12:12.189 --> 1:12:14.090
What? Let's go, let's go Joel.

1:12:14.157 --> 1:12:17.826
Yes,
just finding my keys.

1:12:19.095 --> 1:12:21.797
Here we are, okay.

1:12:21.865 --> 1:12:22.966
Everyone ready?

1:12:27.836 --> 1:12:31.241
I'm gonna kill you
when we get home.
