WEBVTT

00:10.000 --> 00:12.083
You wanted to
see me, Delenn?

00:12.833 --> 00:14.542
Yes.

00:14.625 --> 00:16.083
I've just received
a message

00:16.167 --> 00:18.375
from the other members
of the Grey Council.

00:18.458 --> 00:20.625
Now that we have
a new leader in place

00:20.708 --> 00:21.667
they wish to see me

00:21.750 --> 00:25.542
and discuss my...status.

00:26.625 --> 00:28.542
What is there
to discuss?

00:29.792 --> 00:31.500
Whether I should
be allowed to continue

00:31.583 --> 00:34.083
as a member
of the Council..

00:34.167 --> 00:36.208
...or be removed.

00:37.750 --> 00:39.750
I will be leaving shortly.

00:39.833 --> 00:42.750
I do not know
if I will return.

00:42.833 --> 00:46.458
It is possible they could remove
me from Babylon 5 as well.

00:46.542 --> 00:47.833
Why would they do that?

00:49.625 --> 00:51.125
Look at me, Lennier.

00:52.375 --> 00:54.333
Being asked to serve
on the Council

00:54.417 --> 00:57.292
is a matter of soul,
not of flesh.

00:57.375 --> 01:00.458
The change that you've gone
through, it shouldn't matter.

01:00.542 --> 01:02.417
But it does,
Lennier.

01:02.500 --> 01:04.458
I made the decision

01:04.542 --> 01:07.000
and now I must
face the consequences.

01:09.042 --> 01:10.792
I have left
detailed instructions

01:10.875 --> 01:13.542
in the event someone else
is assigned here

01:13.625 --> 01:17.292
and...I updated
all my diaries.

01:17.375 --> 01:19.500
You will have everything
you need in case--

01:19.583 --> 01:22.167
In case I never
see you again.

01:24.417 --> 01:25.833
Lennier..

01:26.583 --> 01:29.333
...for the first time..

01:29.417 --> 01:33.167
I feel very much...alone.

01:34.458 --> 01:35.917
No.

01:38.167 --> 01:39.792
Never alone, Delenn.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.208
Never alone.

01:44.417 --> 01:46.125
The last two ships
that came to Sector 92

01:46.208 --> 01:48.083
both reported
unusual sightings.

01:48.167 --> 01:50.042
- Description?
- Not much to go on.

01:50.125 --> 01:51.917
A bright light,
turbulence.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.750
We've also had reports
of at least one transport

01:53.833 --> 01:56.000
disappearing off the screens
in that area.

01:56.083 --> 01:58.250
It may be unrelated,
but you never know.

01:59.042 --> 02:01.042
It can't be raiders.

02:01.125 --> 02:02.875
They're pretty much
out of business these days.

02:02.958 --> 02:05.083
I agree.
But something's going on.

02:05.167 --> 02:07.000
And since it's within
our jurisdiction

02:07.083 --> 02:08.667
I think we should check it out.

02:08.750 --> 02:10.333
Is Zeta squadron
available?

02:10.417 --> 02:12.708
Alpha and Zeta squads
are both at another mission.

02:12.792 --> 02:14.250
Delta leader's down sick.

02:14.333 --> 02:15.583
I could assign it
to a second.

02:15.667 --> 02:18.833
No. I've got a better idea.
I'll go.

02:18.917 --> 02:20.333
I don't think
you should do that, sir.

02:20.417 --> 02:22.083
This isn't a clear
and present danger, commander.

02:22.167 --> 02:25.208
It's just a quick look-around
to see what the problem is.

02:25.292 --> 02:26.875
I haven't felt
space beneath me

02:26.958 --> 02:29.250
since I got here in January.
And I miss it.

02:29.333 --> 02:31.375
Besides, if I don't put
some flight time in soon

02:31.458 --> 02:32.917
I'm gonna lose my flight pay.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.833
Very well.
But you'll take a full escort.

02:35.917 --> 02:37.458
Alright. Alright.

02:37.542 --> 02:39.458
I'll be in and out
in an hour.

02:39.542 --> 02:41.625
What could go wrong, hmm?

02:42.250 --> 02:43.917
[intense music]

03:02.375 --> 03:07.750
(male narrator)
The Babylon project was
our last best hope for peace.

03:07.833 --> 03:10.750
A self-contained world
five miles long

03:10.833 --> 03:13.208
located in neutral territory.

03:16.458 --> 03:18.458
A place of commerce
and diplomacy

03:18.542 --> 03:22.208
for a quarter of a million
humans and aliens.

03:22.292 --> 03:25.250
A shining beacon in space..

03:25.333 --> 03:27.500
...all alone in the night.

03:27.583 --> 03:31.000
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind

03:31.083 --> 03:35.292
the year the Great War
came upon us all.

03:35.375 --> 03:39.458
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

03:39.542 --> 03:41.667
The year is 2259.

03:41.750 --> 03:45.125
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

03:48.417 --> 03:49.667
[theme music]

04:48.500 --> 04:49.792
Your flier's recharged

04:49.875 --> 04:52.250
and is ready for departure
at any time.

04:52.333 --> 04:55.375
Good.
Thank you.

04:55.458 --> 04:57.208
As is mine.

04:57.292 --> 04:59.417
Lennier, you do not
have a flier.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.375
Correct. I've arranged
to borrow one from our courier.

05:02.458 --> 05:04.208
You do not have to go
with me.

05:04.958 --> 05:06.792
That is also correct.

05:06.875 --> 05:08.250
Nonetheless,
I will accompany you.

05:09.083 --> 05:10.542
Lennier, listen to me.

05:10.625 --> 05:12.792
The Council holds me
in disfavor right now.

05:12.875 --> 05:16.042
I do not want that
to spill over on to you.

05:16.125 --> 05:17.875
I'm not worried
about that.

05:17.958 --> 05:20.833
Of course not.
You're young.

05:20.917 --> 05:24.167
And youth is both foolish
and vulnerable.

05:24.250 --> 05:27.417
This is not a wise thing
for you to do.

05:28.917 --> 05:30.333
Probably not.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.375
Have I mentioned recently

05:33.458 --> 05:37.000
how much I...appreciate
you, Lennier?

05:37.083 --> 05:38.500
Not really.

05:38.583 --> 05:40.667
But it will give us something
to discuss on our trip.

05:54.875 --> 05:55.875
[beeps]

05:55.958 --> 05:57.750
Receive.

05:57.833 --> 05:59.375
I pulled together
your escort, captain.

05:59.458 --> 06:01.583
They'll meet you in
Fighter Bay 9 in half an hour.

06:01.667 --> 06:03.583
Good. Anything else?

06:03.667 --> 06:05.833
(Commander Ivanova)
'Yes, sir. We received word
from General Hague's office'

06:05.917 --> 06:07.792
'that he'll be arriving
earlier than he had thought.'

06:07.875 --> 06:10.542
ETA 1800 hours.

06:10.625 --> 06:12.375
- And?
- That's all.

06:12.458 --> 06:14.875
Captain, if member of the
Joint Chiefs is coming aboard

06:14.958 --> 06:17.458
I should have been informed.
There's protocol to consider.

06:17.542 --> 06:20.125
This is a cordial
and unofficial visit, commander.

06:20.208 --> 06:21.292
Even so.

06:21.375 --> 06:23.875
Commander, this
is a private matter.

06:23.958 --> 06:25.583
I was going to tell you
all about it when he got here

06:25.667 --> 06:28.083
but as you said he's arriving
ahead of schedule.

06:28.167 --> 06:30.125
And I should be back by then.

06:30.208 --> 06:32.167
- Anything else?
- No, sir.

06:32.250 --> 06:34.958
Good.
See you when I get back.

06:42.875 --> 06:44.333
Man, I say you're
full of it.

06:44.417 --> 06:46.042
The Dodgers will never make it
to the world series.

06:46.125 --> 06:47.583
Hell, they'll be lucky
if they make it

06:47.667 --> 06:49.958
to the playoffs without
embarrassing themselves!

06:50.042 --> 06:51.458
Your diagnosis, doctor?

06:51.542 --> 06:54.083
Oh, the patient
is confused, delusional

06:54.167 --> 06:56.125
unable to separate
his natural sense

06:56.208 --> 06:57.542
of loyalty
for his home team

06:57.625 --> 06:59.458
from the reality
that they stink.

06:59.542 --> 07:01.458
And they only got into
the playoffs on a technicality.

07:01.542 --> 07:02.667
Yeah, what technicality?

07:02.750 --> 07:04.125
The Mars team hit
more home runs

07:04.208 --> 07:05.667
than any other team
on the books.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.500
Only because
Martian gravity

07:07.583 --> 07:09.167
is 40 percent less than
Earth normal, alright.

07:09.250 --> 07:10.833
The ball travels faster
and further

07:10.917 --> 07:12.500
skewing the results.

07:12.583 --> 07:14.333
Now, once they hit
Earth gravity

07:14.417 --> 07:16.292
Helen Keller could bat
better than any one of them.

07:16.375 --> 07:17.458
Ouch!

07:17.542 --> 07:19.958
You wanna put your money
where your mouth is?

07:20.042 --> 07:22.250
Okay. Okay.

07:22.333 --> 07:25.167
Thirty credits says
Morris gets swept, 4-0.

07:25.250 --> 07:26.542
- You're on.
- Mm-hmm.

07:26.625 --> 07:29.833
[watch beeps]
Ramirez. Go.

07:29.917 --> 07:32.542
(Commander Ivanova)
'Lieutenant Ramirez, please
report to Starfury Bay 9'

07:32.625 --> 07:33.833
'for immediate launch.'

07:33.917 --> 07:35.333
Yeah, I'll be
right there.

07:37.917 --> 07:40.500
I'm gonna have a great dinner
on your 30 credits, doc.

07:40.583 --> 07:42.125
(Stephen)
'Yeah, dream on.'

07:43.750 --> 07:44.958
Helen Keller?

07:46.708 --> 07:48.625
Heat of the moment.

07:52.458 --> 07:54.708
(Commander Ivanova)
'Your escort's in place,
captain.'

07:54.792 --> 07:55.958
Thank you, commander.

07:56.042 --> 07:58.333
Finishing systems check.

07:58.417 --> 07:59.875
Ready for launch.

07:59.958 --> 08:01.958
(Commander Ivanova)
'You're clear for drop.
Happy hunting!'

08:19.792 --> 08:21.458
(Captain Sheridan)
'Now, this is more like it.'

08:21.542 --> 08:23.000
(Commander Ivanova)
'Now, captain.'

08:23.083 --> 08:24.083
Yes, commander?

08:24.167 --> 08:25.583
If you continue
in this behavior

08:25.667 --> 08:28.667
you'll just make the other
pilots feel inadequate.

08:28.750 --> 08:30.458
Spoilsport.

08:30.542 --> 08:32.417
(Commander Ivanova)
'What was that, captain?
You're breaking up.'

08:33.875 --> 08:35.417
Nothing, commander.

08:53.667 --> 08:57.417
You will have to wait out here
until I'm finished inside.

08:57.500 --> 08:58.917
Only members
of the Council and a few

08:59.000 --> 09:01.458
acolytes are allowed
beyond this point.

09:01.542 --> 09:02.917
I understand.

09:03.042 --> 09:05.958
I will wait...and
I will pray for you

09:06.042 --> 09:09.208
if you would not
consider it presumptuous.

09:09.292 --> 09:11.333
No, not at all.

09:14.708 --> 09:18.000
Until later, Satai Delenn.

09:23.042 --> 09:25.458
Survey 1
to Survey 2 and 4.

09:25.542 --> 09:27.375
- 'You getting anything?'
- Negative.

09:27.458 --> 09:31.375
Spectral analysis radiation
all looks normal.

09:32.750 --> 09:35.125
No sign of debris.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.417
'You want us to make
another pass, captain?'

09:37.500 --> 09:41.792
No, I guess not.
Nothing much to see.

09:41.875 --> 09:44.042
Well, at least it got us out
of the house for a while.

09:45.250 --> 09:47.542
Alright, let's head on
back to the barn.

09:47.625 --> 09:49.083
Activate homing beacons.

09:53.375 --> 09:54.625
What the hell!

09:57.667 --> 09:59.542
Evasive action!
Evasive action!

10:04.958 --> 10:06.333
Engines at critical!

10:07.583 --> 10:08.917
Ejecting!

10:20.125 --> 10:22.750
(crew #1)
'Swinging around this way.
We got to get out of here.'

10:22.833 --> 10:24.250
Not without the captain.

10:56.083 --> 10:57.208
Captain!

11:08.625 --> 11:09.917
Come on!

11:10.000 --> 11:11.917
I can do this.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Come back to me.

11:14.083 --> 11:16.458
[automated]
'Power supply at 10 percent.'

11:16.542 --> 11:20.167
'Damage to stabilizers,
rear and anterior thrusters.'

11:20.250 --> 11:23.458
'Detecting leak
in fusion reactor system.'

11:23.542 --> 11:26.375
Leak? How bad?

11:26.458 --> 11:30.292
[automated]
'Radiation levels 35 percent
beyond safe limits.'

11:30.375 --> 11:33.500
'Project increase
of 5 percent every half-hour.'

11:35.167 --> 11:38.250
How long until the radiation
reaches terminal levels?

11:38.333 --> 11:42.000
[automated]
'Radiation leak already
at terminal level.'

11:47.417 --> 11:48.875
Communications system?

11:48.958 --> 11:51.167
[automated]
'Not functioning.'

11:53.792 --> 11:56.042
Then we had to have..

11:57.250 --> 12:00.000
...we have to head back,
tell them what happened.

12:00.083 --> 12:02.458
It's the captain's
only chance.

12:02.542 --> 12:05.625
Redirect maximum possible
energy from life support

12:05.708 --> 12:08.083
to system controls.

12:09.292 --> 12:11.792
Set for jumpgate
sequence start.

12:11.875 --> 12:14.250
[automated]
'Activating jumpgate sequence.'

12:38.250 --> 12:39.667
General, welcome
to Babylon 5.

12:39.750 --> 12:40.792
Commander.

12:40.875 --> 12:42.292
I apologize for the lack
of an honor guard

12:42.375 --> 12:44.375
but your office gave us
specific instructions.

12:44.458 --> 12:46.958
Yes, well, I don't like
to make a fuss.

12:47.042 --> 12:49.208
Never did care much
for all that show.

12:49.292 --> 12:51.625
I was told Captain Sheridan
would be here.

12:51.708 --> 12:53.833
He went to look into a problem
in an outer sector.

12:53.917 --> 12:55.125
He should be back
any time now.

12:55.208 --> 12:58.250
This isn't like him.
He's never late.

12:58.333 --> 13:00.167
If he knew when I was arriving,
he'd have been here.

13:00.250 --> 13:01.667
I hope it isn't serious.

13:01.750 --> 13:03.500
C&amp;C's trying to get
a clear channel

13:03.583 --> 13:04.792
for a status report.

13:04.875 --> 13:07.125
They probably
reached him by now.

13:46.875 --> 13:48.500
Hey!

13:50.458 --> 13:52.500
Hey, anybody here?

13:54.083 --> 13:56.250
'Anybody hear me?'

13:59.500 --> 14:00.542
Hey..

14:01.625 --> 14:04.167
My name is John Sheridan.

14:04.250 --> 14:06.875
Captain...Earthforce.

14:14.125 --> 14:16.583
My name is John Sheridan.

14:16.667 --> 14:18.750
Captain, Earthforce.

14:47.875 --> 14:49.625
Summoned.

14:49.708 --> 14:52.583
I take the place
that has been prepared for me.

14:53.708 --> 14:55.583
I am Grey.

14:55.667 --> 14:59.667
I stand between the candle
and the star.

14:59.750 --> 15:01.667
We are Grey.

15:01.750 --> 15:05.958
We stand between
the darkness and the light.

15:06.042 --> 15:08.292
'They will not come, Delenn.'

15:08.375 --> 15:10.167
But I was summoned.

15:11.625 --> 15:13.000
To receive judgment, yes.

15:13.083 --> 15:14.917
Not to appear
as one of the Nine.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.167
I'm entitled
to a hearing.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.333
I'm allowed
to defend myself.

15:19.417 --> 15:22.125
That was before
you disobeyed us.

15:22.208 --> 15:25.667
You were told to wait
before taking this action.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.875
Before becoming..

15:28.708 --> 15:30.542
'...alien to us.'

15:32.083 --> 15:35.042
You've been away from us
for too long, Delenn.

15:35.125 --> 15:36.333
Your contact
with the humans

15:36.417 --> 15:39.500
has changed more
than your appearance.

15:39.583 --> 15:42.333
If you are no longer
one of us

15:42.417 --> 15:45.500
'how can you be
one of the Nine?'

15:45.583 --> 15:48.458
My heart has not changed.

15:48.542 --> 15:53.542
We no longer know
your heart, Delenn.

15:53.625 --> 15:56.458
The Council has voted to remove
you from our presence.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.417
'From this day forth,
you are no longer'

15:59.500 --> 16:02.583
'a member of the Grey Council,
no longer Satai.'

16:05.167 --> 16:06.792
I'm sorry, Delenn.

16:06.875 --> 16:08.000
Wait.

16:09.417 --> 16:11.875
What about my appointment
to Babylon 5?

16:11.958 --> 16:13.875
My position as ambassador
is separate

16:13.958 --> 16:16.000
from my role as Satai.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.667
We are still
debating this.

16:20.542 --> 16:21.833
It is your right
to make a statement

16:21.917 --> 16:24.042
before the Nine,
if that is your wish.

16:24.125 --> 16:26.958
It is.
Thank you.

16:28.333 --> 16:30.125
May I ask..

16:30.208 --> 16:32.208
who was chosen
to replace me?

16:33.958 --> 16:36.708
I will convene the Nine.

16:36.792 --> 16:38.750
When we are ready,
you will be summoned.

16:47.333 --> 16:48.708
Still no word
from Captain Sheridan?

16:48.792 --> 16:50.083
We can't raise any of them
so I think--

16:50.167 --> 16:52.292
Jumpgate activated.
One ship.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.292
Is that one of
the survey ships?

17:03.375 --> 17:04.417
Yes.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.583
She's been shot up
pretty badly.

17:06.667 --> 17:08.333
Scanners indicate
she's on autopilot.

17:08.417 --> 17:10.250
Minimal life signs.

17:10.333 --> 17:12.708
Ivanova to Medlab,
this is a priority-one alert.

17:25.250 --> 17:27.250
Why are you doing this?

17:28.250 --> 17:30.208
Why are you torturing me?

17:33.167 --> 17:36.167
You can at least tell me
what you want.

17:55.583 --> 17:56.958
That device.

17:57.042 --> 17:58.375
Nu'shakarr!

18:00.250 --> 18:03.042
That's what's making you
do this, isn't it?

18:05.625 --> 18:06.583
Fight it.

18:06.667 --> 18:08.667
'Fight it!'

18:20.000 --> 18:21.292
[grunting]

18:28.875 --> 18:30.375
Who are they?

18:30.458 --> 18:33.250
Why are they doing this?
Dosh-vann?

19:00.292 --> 19:01.542
[grunting]

19:07.917 --> 19:09.167
Aah!

19:19.667 --> 19:20.875
Zatrak!

19:22.417 --> 19:23.625
Zatrak!

19:24.917 --> 19:26.167
Kill me!

19:27.292 --> 19:29.375
That's what they want,
isn't it?

19:29.458 --> 19:31.333
For us
to kill each other?

19:31.417 --> 19:35.208
What is it to him, huh?
Sport? Entertainment?

19:36.625 --> 19:38.333
- Kill me!
- No!

19:53.667 --> 19:55.042
Still alive.

19:57.792 --> 19:59.083
Still alive!

20:02.750 --> 20:04.750
Alright, pump in
another 50 cc's of morphozine.

20:04.833 --> 20:06.708
I want those scanners
online now!

20:08.125 --> 20:09.167
How's he doing?

20:09.250 --> 20:10.792
Oh, he's soaked up
in lot of radiation.

20:10.875 --> 20:13.042
We got to be careful, or he'll
contaminate the whole place.

20:13.125 --> 20:14.667
Steven, if he sucked up
that much radiation--

20:14.750 --> 20:17.417
Look, don't tell me my business
and I won't tell you yours!

20:17.500 --> 20:19.292
Start a full-body
transfusion.

20:19.375 --> 20:22.708
I need more regen packs. You
line them up! Now, move!

20:22.792 --> 20:24.458
Doc!

20:24.542 --> 20:27.917
Ramirez, don't try to talk.
You're gonna be alright, okay?

20:28.000 --> 20:32.917
I guess I won't...collect
the...30 credits.

20:34.208 --> 20:35.792
Ramirez!

20:35.875 --> 20:38.292
Ramirez, don't you do this
to me! Damn it!

20:39.500 --> 20:41.417
You did all you could.
Come on. He..

20:44.917 --> 20:46.500
Ramirez.

20:46.583 --> 20:48.042
I heard.

20:48.125 --> 20:51.208
We finished going over the
data record from his Starfury.

20:51.292 --> 20:53.292
It looks like an alien ship
took the captain.

20:54.917 --> 20:56.542
Totally unknown
configuration.

20:56.625 --> 20:58.750
Meaning we don't know
where it came from

20:58.833 --> 21:00.167
or where it's going.

21:01.667 --> 21:02.917
Great.

21:21.208 --> 21:25.125
For 20 cycles, I stood beside
you as one of the Nine.

21:25.208 --> 21:28.292
'I called many of you friends.'

21:28.375 --> 21:32.792
And now you call me...outcast.

21:32.875 --> 21:34.542
You know me.

21:34.625 --> 21:37.042
You know I believe in the task
that is before us

21:37.125 --> 21:39.458
the Great War
that is coming.

21:39.542 --> 21:41.875
I have not turned
my back on you.

21:41.958 --> 21:44.375
In trying to help,
I have sacrificed

21:44.458 --> 21:46.958
all that I was
and all that I am.

21:47.042 --> 21:49.042
We can no longer
allow ourselves

21:49.125 --> 21:51.375
to be separated
by names and borders.

21:51.458 --> 21:55.875
Our two sides must unite
or be destroyed.

21:55.958 --> 21:59.625
Do not make my sacrifice
a vain one.

21:59.708 --> 22:02.750
Allow me to finish
what I started.

22:02.833 --> 22:05.250
In the name of our friendship

22:05.333 --> 22:07.542
and the future of our people

22:07.625 --> 22:10.542
let me remain
with Babylon 5.

22:10.625 --> 22:13.167
I'm more than happy
to have you remain

22:13.250 --> 22:15.875
with the humans.

22:15.958 --> 22:18.083
You are the one
chosen to replace me?

22:19.750 --> 22:21.375
I do not know you.

22:21.458 --> 22:22.833
I believe you do.

22:25.583 --> 22:26.750
Neroon!

22:27.833 --> 22:29.458
I do not understand!

22:29.542 --> 22:32.625
He is Warrior Caste
from the Star Rider's clan!

22:33.500 --> 22:35.375
What is happening here?

22:35.458 --> 22:36.708
What are you doing?

22:38.708 --> 22:40.750
When Valen called
the Nine together

22:40.833 --> 22:42.917
he chose three
from the Worker Caste

22:43.000 --> 22:44.333
three from
the Religious Caste

22:44.417 --> 22:45.958
and three
from the Warrior Caste.

22:46.042 --> 22:48.583
My replacement should have been
from the Religious Caste.

22:48.667 --> 22:50.667
Four from the Warrior Caste

22:50.750 --> 22:52.708
gives them
unprecedented power.

22:52.792 --> 22:53.917
(Neroon)
'Why not?'

22:54.000 --> 22:55.583
It was the Warrior Caste
who died

22:55.667 --> 22:57.125
in the war against
the Earthers.

22:57.208 --> 23:00.542
'Warrior Caste who have defended
our world for centuries'

23:00.625 --> 23:03.792
while the Council floated
among the stars

23:03.875 --> 23:05.583
isolated from
its own people.

23:05.667 --> 23:06.792
This is wrong!

23:06.875 --> 23:08.167
Is it?

23:08.250 --> 23:11.125
You say a prophecy tells us
a great war is coming.

23:11.208 --> 23:13.750
Should not the Warrior Caste
lead against it?

23:13.833 --> 23:16.875
The Warrior Caste cannot be
allowed to set policy.

23:16.958 --> 23:18.458
(Neroon)
'Have you done any better?'

23:19.667 --> 23:21.250
When I was inducted
into this circle

23:21.333 --> 23:23.333
I was finally told
the reason

23:23.417 --> 23:24.667
we were ordered
to surrender.

23:24.750 --> 23:27.875
I didn't know
whether to laugh or weep.

23:27.958 --> 23:30.500
If we had been told
the truth then

23:30.583 --> 23:32.458
we never would have
surrendered.

23:32.542 --> 23:33.833
You do not understand.

23:33.917 --> 23:36.042
I understand that
before me is a creature

23:36.125 --> 23:38.042
I do not recognize.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.667
One foot in two worlds.

23:40.750 --> 23:44.667
'You are an affront
to the purity of our race!'

23:44.750 --> 23:46.833
'And your belief that
you are satisfying prophecy'

23:46.917 --> 23:48.750
'is presumption
of the highest order'

23:48.833 --> 23:53.792
and yet, it is true
that you are now

23:53.875 --> 23:57.583
the perfect liaison
between us and the Earthers.

23:57.667 --> 24:00.000
'You have no home
with either of us.'

24:00.083 --> 24:02.958
So please, act out
your fantasy.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.292
Be our go-between.

24:04.375 --> 24:06.708
Return to Babylon 5

24:07.458 --> 24:08.917
and stay there.

24:26.125 --> 24:29.542
Hey. Hey, try not
to move too much.

24:29.625 --> 24:33.458
Looks like I broke a couple of
your ribs when I put you down.

24:33.542 --> 24:35.708
I think one may have
punctured your lung.

24:40.917 --> 24:43.667
Here. It's disabled.

24:43.750 --> 24:45.250
On the chance that
it was self-repairing

24:45.333 --> 24:48.500
I took it apart pretty
thoroughly when you were out.

24:58.458 --> 25:01.292
No. No water.

25:01.375 --> 25:04.417
So far, they haven't given us
anything to eat or drink.

25:08.667 --> 25:12.458
I haven't seen anybody
but you and...one other.

25:12.542 --> 25:14.417
[groans]

25:14.500 --> 25:15.583
Hey.

25:17.917 --> 25:20.000
[groaning]

25:20.083 --> 25:21.208
This whole place
is probably running

25:21.292 --> 25:23.542
on automatic
for all I know.

25:28.833 --> 25:30.458
Listen..

25:30.542 --> 25:31.875
[grunts]

25:31.958 --> 25:34.125
Do you have any idea
why we're here?

25:35.833 --> 25:37.958
What they want from us?

25:39.000 --> 25:41.292
Scout for invasion.

25:41.375 --> 25:42.875
Experiment.

25:44.375 --> 25:46.917
Evaluate potential targets.

25:49.583 --> 25:51.042
Analyze.

25:51.125 --> 25:52.667
Analyze us?

25:57.125 --> 25:59.083
So this is like
some kind of a..

25:59.167 --> 26:00.625
...big research system

26:00.708 --> 26:02.292
picking up samples

26:02.375 --> 26:06.375
deciding who's a good prospect
for invasion?

26:06.458 --> 26:07.583
Yeah.

26:08.708 --> 26:11.500
That explains
this device, then.

26:15.292 --> 26:16.833
They want to push us

26:16.917 --> 26:18.583
see how much pain
we can stand

26:18.667 --> 26:21.083
how well we'll fight.

26:21.167 --> 26:22.250
Our ships
probably give them

26:22.333 --> 26:24.708
a good idea of our
level of technology.

26:27.250 --> 26:29.500
I wonder what they're
looking for now.

26:30.833 --> 26:32.833
Our resourcefulness?

26:32.917 --> 26:34.000
If we'll betray
each other

26:34.083 --> 26:35.875
or work together?

26:37.250 --> 26:39.500
Easy, easy.
Come on, now.

26:39.583 --> 26:43.333
Look, we get out of here,
we'll get you to a doctor.

26:43.417 --> 26:46.792
First obligation
of a prisoner is to escape.

26:46.875 --> 26:48.208
Right?

26:50.542 --> 26:51.958
Right?

26:53.875 --> 26:55.542
Listen, before, uh..

26:57.083 --> 26:59.250
...why did you ask me
to kill you?

27:06.500 --> 27:09.083
There is no escape.

27:13.542 --> 27:15.167
Better to die.

27:15.250 --> 27:17.958
- To die.
- Oh, no, you don't.

27:40.042 --> 27:41.833
Satai Delenn?

27:41.917 --> 27:44.125
Only Delenn
from now on.

27:44.208 --> 27:45.417
The Grey Council feels

27:45.500 --> 27:46.542
that I can best
serve our people

27:46.625 --> 27:48.667
by staying on Babylon 5.

27:48.750 --> 27:51.500
They feel very
positively about it.

27:51.583 --> 27:54.417
The Council
is very wise.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.250
Yes.

27:56.333 --> 27:58.667
Of course.

27:58.750 --> 28:01.708
You do not have to go back
with me, Lennier.

28:01.792 --> 28:03.000
You could go home.

28:03.083 --> 28:04.750
You could be free
of all this.

28:04.833 --> 28:07.292
Return to your studies,
to your family..

28:07.375 --> 28:09.833
Where you walk,
I will walk.

28:09.917 --> 28:11.833
I have sworn myself
to your side.

28:11.917 --> 28:13.250
You do not know.

28:13.333 --> 28:15.333
You cannot know
what you're saying.

28:15.417 --> 28:16.792
Yes, I do.

28:16.875 --> 28:18.583
Come what may, Delenn

28:18.667 --> 28:21.042
I will not leave you
while I am still alive.

28:24.625 --> 28:27.792
I remember when
you first came to me.

28:27.875 --> 28:29.750
You would not look up

28:29.833 --> 28:32.000
until I ordered you
to do so.

28:33.708 --> 28:35.542
But it did no good.

28:35.625 --> 28:37.708
Even when you were
looking up

28:37.792 --> 28:39.375
you were looking down.

28:41.833 --> 28:43.542
Look at me, Lennier.

28:45.500 --> 28:47.375
Very soon now

28:47.458 --> 28:49.833
I will be going
into darkness

28:49.917 --> 28:51.625
and fire.

28:51.708 --> 28:54.917
I do not know if I'm fated
to walk out again.

28:56.333 --> 28:58.667
If it is your choice
to come with me..

29:00.875 --> 29:03.042
...then I could not wish
for a better

29:04.208 --> 29:06.083
a braver companion.

29:17.083 --> 29:19.083
I heard there's been a sighting
of the alien ship.

29:19.167 --> 29:21.000
It's popped out
of hyperspace twice more

29:21.083 --> 29:23.250
long enough to attack ships
from two different species.

29:23.333 --> 29:25.667
It's almost as if
it's collecting specimens.

29:25.750 --> 29:27.000
And that helps.

29:27.083 --> 29:28.250
Every time it stops
to grab another ship

29:28.333 --> 29:29.750
we gain more time
to catch up to it

29:29.833 --> 29:31.667
before it can get back
to its homeworld.

29:31.750 --> 29:33.500
Well, unfortunately, we're
no closer to finding out

29:33.583 --> 29:35.583
where that is now than
we were when we started.

29:35.667 --> 29:38.042
Have you been coordinating
with the alien governments?

29:38.125 --> 29:40.042
With these new attacks,
they have a vested interest

29:40.125 --> 29:41.500
in stopping this thing.

29:41.583 --> 29:43.625
I've given all the ambassadors
a full description.

29:43.708 --> 29:45.250
I've also recalled
all of our fighters

29:45.333 --> 29:46.667
and placed them on standby.

29:46.750 --> 29:48.625
They're ready to go
as soon as we hear anything.

29:48.708 --> 29:49.833
Good.

29:49.917 --> 29:52.292
On the theory that we may need
added firepower

29:52.375 --> 29:54.875
I've placed a few calls
of my own.

29:54.958 --> 29:56.125
Jumpgate activated.

30:02.083 --> 30:03.333
The Agamemnon!

30:03.417 --> 30:05.458
The captain's old ship.

30:05.542 --> 30:08.292
And I thought they might be
interested in lending a hand.

30:08.375 --> 30:09.542
She's the fastest thing
in the area.

30:09.625 --> 30:12.417
If she can't catch
that ship, nobody can.

30:12.500 --> 30:14.083
Now, we've got the power.

30:14.167 --> 30:16.417
All we need now
is the target.

30:42.542 --> 30:44.167
Shh.

30:48.375 --> 30:50.250
Do you know who I am?

31:07.667 --> 31:09.958
The man in between
is searching for you.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.083
You are the hand.

31:22.542 --> 31:24.375
Why are you here?

31:25.542 --> 31:27.583
We were never away.

31:27.667 --> 31:28.917
For the first time

31:29.000 --> 31:32.292
your mind is quiet
enough to hear me.

31:32.375 --> 31:34.000
Why am I here?

31:35.375 --> 31:38.375
You have always
been here.

32:00.500 --> 32:02.000
Give me a lever big enough

32:02.083 --> 32:04.167
and I will move the world.

32:06.750 --> 32:09.833
(Delenn)
'Minbari flier Zalon
to Babylon Control.'

32:09.917 --> 32:12.167
(Babylon Control)
'Confirmed, Minbari flier.
We read you.'

32:12.250 --> 32:14.333
I have been trying
for some time to make contact.

32:14.417 --> 32:15.917
Is there a problem?

32:16.000 --> 32:19.042
'Yes, ambassador. Captain
Sheridan is reported missing.'

32:19.125 --> 32:21.125
'We're asking all ships
in the region for help.'

32:22.167 --> 32:23.667
Send me the information, please.

32:23.750 --> 32:25.125
'Stand by.'

32:25.208 --> 32:27.167
Commander, I've got
Ambassador Delenn on the line.

32:27.250 --> 32:29.667
She says she has information
about the alien ship.

32:29.750 --> 32:31.667
Put her through.

32:31.750 --> 32:33.625
Ambassador, what have you got?

32:33.708 --> 32:37.583
The ship which has taken
Captain Sheridan is known to us.

32:37.667 --> 32:39.542
They are called the Streibs.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.875
Over the years,
they have sent out ships

32:41.958 --> 32:43.292
to investigate defenses

32:43.375 --> 32:47.042
and acquire samples of any life
forms they encountered.

32:47.125 --> 32:51.208
The last expedition
was into Minbari space.

32:51.292 --> 32:53.542
We dragged them back
to their homeworld

32:53.625 --> 32:55.833
and made sure
they understood

32:55.917 --> 32:57.375
the depth of their mistake.

32:57.458 --> 32:59.458
Can you give us the coordinates
for their homeworld?

32:59.542 --> 33:00.750
Of course.

33:24.500 --> 33:28.375
It feels like we just jumped
back into normal space.

33:28.458 --> 33:29.833
It was just
another quick stop

33:29.917 --> 33:32.375
or...we're approaching
their homeworld.

33:32.458 --> 33:34.792
Either way, there's
not much time left.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.083
We've jumped back
to hyperspace.

33:56.167 --> 33:58.375
No, that was no jump.

33:58.458 --> 34:00.208
All fighters,
fire at will

34:00.292 --> 34:02.083
'but only acquire
external targets.'

34:02.167 --> 34:03.250
'Confirm.'

34:07.333 --> 34:09.792
We've been hit!

34:09.875 --> 34:12.083
They're probably redirecting
power to the engines.

34:12.167 --> 34:13.917
They'll also
be distracted.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.417
This is our chance.
Come on.

34:16.500 --> 34:17.542
[grunting]

34:19.708 --> 34:22.333
This is Ambassador Delenn
of the Minbari.

34:22.417 --> 34:24.292
If you remember
our last confrontation

34:24.375 --> 34:27.292
you will release
your prisoners at once.

34:39.583 --> 34:40.667
Come on.

34:40.750 --> 34:44.375
- Come on!
- Ohh! Ohh!

34:44.458 --> 34:46.792
We've come this far.
You can't die on me now.

34:46.875 --> 34:50.292
No. No. You go.
Leave me.

34:50.375 --> 34:51.667
Like hell!

34:51.750 --> 34:53.042
Aah!

34:54.333 --> 34:56.417
[alarm blaring]

34:56.500 --> 34:57.750
They know.

34:57.833 --> 35:00.292
No, it sounds like
a general alarm.

35:03.917 --> 35:05.958
Hey, you wait here.

35:17.375 --> 35:19.125
I thought I told you
to wait for me.

35:19.208 --> 35:20.458
[groaning]

35:22.958 --> 35:24.000
'What is that?'

35:24.083 --> 35:26.750
- Survival pod.
- Survival?

35:26.833 --> 35:28.625
Hell, let's move.

35:28.708 --> 35:29.792
Come on!

35:42.292 --> 35:45.375
Oh, my God!
They've spaced the captives.

35:45.458 --> 35:48.833
Killed them.
Those arrogant sons of..

35:48.917 --> 35:50.167
Take them down!

35:58.583 --> 36:00.875
Just a second.
I'm picking up a signal.

36:00.958 --> 36:03.042
One of them is
making a break for it.

36:03.125 --> 36:04.667
'Moving in on attack vector.'

36:04.750 --> 36:07.542
Three dots, three dashes,
three dots.

36:07.625 --> 36:09.542
SOS. Hold your fire!

36:09.625 --> 36:11.667
It's the captain!

36:16.083 --> 36:17.958
How is he, doc?

36:18.042 --> 36:19.333
He lost a lot of blood

36:19.417 --> 36:21.542
suffered four broken ribs
and some internal bruising

36:21.625 --> 36:22.625
but he'll make it.

36:22.708 --> 36:24.292
Hmm.

36:24.375 --> 36:26.667
What about Ramirez?

36:30.833 --> 36:33.375
Made it back,
but we lost him.

36:33.458 --> 36:35.000
Radiation poisoning.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.792
It doesn't make sense,
does it?

36:48.042 --> 36:49.250
I mean, wh..

36:49.333 --> 36:51.792
Why am I still alive,
and he..

36:53.875 --> 36:56.250
He was just a kid.

36:57.500 --> 36:58.792
It's not fair.

36:58.875 --> 37:00.958
No, it's not.

37:02.625 --> 37:04.417
Death never is.

37:10.125 --> 37:13.000
You have always
been here.

37:21.458 --> 37:23.208
[bell rings]

37:23.292 --> 37:24.458
Come.

37:28.583 --> 37:30.542
No, no. After what
you've been through

37:30.625 --> 37:32.583
you deserve to sit
for a while.

37:34.417 --> 37:35.875
Sure.

37:38.042 --> 37:40.833
I was hoping to go aboard
the Agamemnon before she left

37:40.917 --> 37:42.375
but I guess
they had to get going.

37:42.458 --> 37:45.208
There's always
a crisis somewhere.

37:53.292 --> 37:55.292
Now we can talk freely.

37:55.375 --> 37:56.583
I don't know
that the room is bugged

37:56.667 --> 37:58.500
but I don't wanna
take any chances.

37:58.583 --> 38:01.500
Well, it is about time
somebody...showed up

38:01.583 --> 38:03.292
to debrief me,
damn it!

38:03.375 --> 38:06.833
I've been waiting here
for six months.

38:06.917 --> 38:09.208
I started feeling like
I'd been abandoned.

38:09.292 --> 38:11.292
I'm sorry.

38:11.375 --> 38:14.083
But with the death
of President Santiago

38:14.167 --> 38:16.333
it's taken a while
to sort things through.

38:16.417 --> 38:17.875
'What have you found out?'

38:17.958 --> 38:20.375
They're all loyal to Earth,
if that's what you mean.

38:20.458 --> 38:23.542
Ivanova, Garibaldi, Franklin
all the rest of them.

38:23.625 --> 38:25.250
They're good people,
general.

38:25.333 --> 38:27.667
I don't like
spying on them.

38:27.750 --> 38:30.000
No, you're not a spy.

38:30.083 --> 38:31.625
More like a..

38:31.708 --> 38:33.417
...trap-door spider.

38:39.458 --> 38:43.583
Santiago understood
the importance of Babylon 5.

38:43.667 --> 38:45.625
He knew that if anything
happened to him

38:45.708 --> 38:48.542
President Clark
would appoint some

38:48.625 --> 38:51.417
hard-nosed jar-head
to run this place.

38:52.750 --> 38:55.167
Well, we both know
you're not that.

38:55.250 --> 38:59.500
But...from your record
you look like that.

38:59.583 --> 39:01.542
Now, if Clark and his friends
think you're one of them

39:01.625 --> 39:03.708
they'll leave you alone,
which is what we need.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.917
Why?

39:08.000 --> 39:09.750
Not everyone back home
buys the party line

39:09.833 --> 39:12.333
that Santiago's death
was an accident.

39:13.833 --> 39:15.292
Yeah, well, lately,
I've been having

39:15.375 --> 39:17.875
some real second thoughts
about this myself.

39:20.333 --> 39:23.333
If Santiago's death
was an assassination

39:23.417 --> 39:25.167
we're talking about
a military coup here.

39:25.250 --> 39:28.875
Not entirely, though they
probably had some support

39:28.958 --> 39:29.917
from within the military.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.583
The intelligence
community

39:31.667 --> 39:32.958
the home guard.

39:33.042 --> 39:35.208
But they're not the ones
calling the shots.

39:35.292 --> 39:37.083
It's Psi Corps, isn't it?

39:37.167 --> 39:38.708
Probably.

39:38.792 --> 39:40.917
The trick is proving it.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.333
We have to proceed
very carefully back home.

39:44.417 --> 39:46.167
If we go too far,
too fast

39:46.250 --> 39:49.625
we'll be...noticed.

39:49.708 --> 39:52.125
Babylon 5, on the other hand
has military intelligence

39:52.208 --> 39:55.750
and civilian sources
to draw upon.

39:55.833 --> 39:57.583
And since they think
you're on their side

39:57.667 --> 39:59.958
they won't be paying
us close attention.

40:00.042 --> 40:01.375
You're making an awfully
big assumption

40:01.458 --> 40:03.750
that I'm on your side.

40:03.833 --> 40:05.292
What makes you think
I won't turn you in

40:05.375 --> 40:07.000
the second you walk out
that door?

40:07.083 --> 40:10.375
A soldier's record
tells a lot about a person.

40:10.458 --> 40:12.458
Not just what he's done..

40:12.542 --> 40:15.292
...but how he's done it
and why.

40:15.375 --> 40:17.542
Now, you have an uncommon
failing for someone

40:17.625 --> 40:20.833
in your position, captain.
You're a patriot.

40:20.917 --> 40:23.667
You believe, as I do, that when
we put on this uniform

40:23.750 --> 40:27.042
we took a solemn vow
to protect Earth

40:27.125 --> 40:30.000
against threats from outside
and from within.

40:32.917 --> 40:35.167
Now, it's a..

40:35.250 --> 40:37.292
...a difficult decision.

40:39.750 --> 40:42.125
You risk losing
your entire career

40:42.208 --> 40:44.458
if you say yes.

40:44.542 --> 40:48.000
Worse still now that
you've had a chance

40:48.083 --> 40:49.833
to evaluate your staff,
you have to decide

40:49.917 --> 40:53.250
if you can trust them enough
to bring them in on this

40:53.333 --> 40:55.917
knowing that you're putting them
in equal jeopardy.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.750
It's not much reward
for being..

40:58.833 --> 41:01.125
...trustworthy, is it?

41:01.208 --> 41:03.083
No.

41:03.167 --> 41:04.708
No, it's not.

41:04.792 --> 41:08.000
But it's time we stopped
reacting and started acting.

41:08.083 --> 41:09.375
Now, in 20 minutes

41:09.458 --> 41:12.542
I'm getting on a ship
and heading for Earth.

41:12.625 --> 41:14.667
I'll try to feed you
as much information as I can

41:14.750 --> 41:16.000
when I can.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.458
Your cooperation
is essential..

41:20.542 --> 41:23.375
...if we're going to take back
our government.

41:24.958 --> 41:26.750
So..

41:26.833 --> 41:30.542
I need your answer, captain,
and I need it now.

41:40.917 --> 41:41.917
[bell rings]

41:42.000 --> 41:43.250
(Captain Sheridan)
'Yes?'

41:43.333 --> 41:44.917
What do you mean,
yes? It's me.

41:46.458 --> 41:48.083
[door opens]

41:49.750 --> 41:52.458
I see he rousted you two
out of bed also.

41:52.542 --> 41:54.417
What's going on?

41:54.500 --> 41:56.750
I think you'd better
sit down, Susan.

42:01.208 --> 42:04.583
Ever since the death
of President Santiago

42:04.667 --> 42:07.375
something unpleasant's
been going on back home.

42:07.458 --> 42:10.708
You know it, and I know it.

42:10.792 --> 42:12.708
We've stood by too long.

42:12.792 --> 42:14.583
That's going to change.

42:14.667 --> 42:16.083
Quietly

42:16.167 --> 42:17.250
discreetly

42:17.333 --> 42:19.250
an inch at a time

42:19.333 --> 42:20.667
and for now

42:20.750 --> 42:23.250
strictly within the rules.

42:23.333 --> 42:25.000
'But we have to do something'

42:25.083 --> 42:28.792
'or risk losing
everything we hold dear.'

42:28.875 --> 42:30.958
'Now, we'll get some help
from inside Earth Dome'

42:31.042 --> 42:32.250
'but the bottom line'

42:32.333 --> 42:35.375
if anything goes wrong,
we're on our own.

42:37.125 --> 42:38.583
Anybody wants to leave now

42:38.667 --> 42:44.375
before you hear anything
you'll have to report, do so.

42:44.458 --> 42:45.583
Nothing will be said.

42:47.125 --> 42:48.625
- I'm in.
- Ditto.

42:50.042 --> 42:52.750
Hey, I never did know
when to butt out.

42:52.833 --> 42:54.083
We're with you,
captain.

42:54.167 --> 42:56.667
Wherever this goes,
however it ends

42:56.750 --> 42:58.208
we're with you.

43:05.708 --> 43:07.750
[theme music]
