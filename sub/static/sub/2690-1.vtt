Like which one?

01:33.160 --> 01:34.286
Like...

01:34.520 --> 01:35.681
...like a wolf.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.806
- Why a wolf?
- Because if a wolf...

01:39.200 --> 01:41.851
...sees you're scared,
it will attack you.

01:42.360 --> 01:44.169
You have to stare back at it...

- Did you pee yourself?
- No, it wasn't me.

02:49.520 --> 02:53.002
- It was the wolf.
- What wolf? You're crazy.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.447
- Let's go home.
- No, let go of me!

02:55.680 --> 02:57.728

06:29.800 --> 06:32.201
- Is that your baby?
- Yes.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.090
Did you get married?

06:34.960 --> 06:38.009
No, you idiot!
She's your daughter.

06:39.320 --> 06:41.243
VALENTIN:
No. Hold on a minute!

06:41.480 --> 06:43.403
I don't want to have children.

06:43.680 --> 06:46.160
I don't want troubles, and that
baby doesn't even look like me...

06:46.320 --> 06:48.004
Do you have ten dollars?

06:48.440 --> 06:51.091
- What?
- Ten dollars, to pay the cab.

06:51.720 --> 06:54.963
No, I don't have dollars.

07:25.440 --> 07:30.048
I don't think your sister
is coming back for the baby.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.568
The truth is...

07:33.080 --> 07:34.525
...it looks like...

07:36.080 --> 07:38.128
...I'm the baby's father.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.881
You did it with your sister?

07:41.480 --> 07:42.891
No! No, no!

07:43.040 --> 07:45.486
No, it's just that...
Well... she's not my sister.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.411
But she did go to pay
the cab, though.

07:50.640 --> 07:51.766

- Here!
- What?

07:54.600 --> 07:55.647
What?

07:55.800 --> 07:59.691
I just remembered
I have to go to the doctor.

08:00.160 --> 08:03.323
Yes, I have a problem with
my... prostate.

08:03.480 --> 08:04.925
Yes. Bye, honey.

08:05.280 --> 08:07.442
Women don't have prostates.

08:07.760 --> 08:08.841
No?

to see a doctor. Bye.

- Can you change diapers, Sammy?

11:31.400 --> 11:34.529
Yeah, sure.
It doesn't have to be disgusting.

11:34.720 --> 11:36.131
It's dirty, but you have to...

11:36.280 --> 11:39.762
...I just go to the bathroom
and wash my hands afterwards.

11:39.920 --> 11:43.447

- She's over there. I'll call her.

It must be here.

Maggie?

12:09.040 --> 12:12.044
Her name is Maggie.
She's named after a sauce.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.647
- Have some vegetables, kid.
- What are you doing?

12:14.800 --> 12:17.007
I'm giving her carrots.

12:17.560 --> 12:18.891
That's too spicy.

12:20.080 --> 12:23.004
Why don't you just keep her?

12:23.200 --> 12:24.850
It's high time you settled down.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.691
No way!
What would I do with a baby?

12:27.880 --> 12:30.690
Goodbye freedom, goodbye tourists!

12:31.000 --> 12:35.403
What will I do for a living?
I might even have to get a job.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.006
And you'll have
to learn English.

12:39.200 --> 12:42.044
'Cause when she starts talking,
you won't understand her.

12:42.400 --> 12:45.688
I'll have to send her to school,
feed her.

12:45.880 --> 12:48.008

why she's growing boobs.

When she's older,
she'll want to borrow my car.

13:01.600 --> 13:05.241
I'll have to beat up her boyfriend
when he knocks her up. No, no!

13:05.760 --> 13:08.127
Besides, I'll suck as a Dad.

13:08.400 --> 13:12.200
Hey, I have an idea!
Write to Angelina Jolie.

13:12.720 --> 13:15.644
Tell her the baby's from
Acapulco or Oaxaca.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.763
Maybe she'll adopt her.

Didn't she leave you a souvenir?

13:37.080 --> 13:38.764
She did.

13:39.160 --> 13:41.208
But I got rid of it with penicillin.

13:41.560 --> 13:46.248
I mean, a telephone number,
an address. Something.

A Julie.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.041
- Really?
- Yes, look.

13:51.200 --> 13:54.602
- She wrote a letter?
- Didn't you know?

13:55.280 --> 13:57.931
She wrote it a year
and a half ago.

13:58.160 --> 13:59.241
Look!

13:59.480 --> 14:00.561
Let me see!

14:00.960 --> 14:04.282
Does she say how to contact her,
a phone number, anything?

14:04.440 --> 14:05.487
No.

14:06.080 --> 14:08.208
It only says:

14:08.800 --> 14:11.485
"I miss you kissing my..."

14:13.600 --> 14:15.489
How very explicit!

14:16.000 --> 14:19.004
Kisses from L.A.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.770
What does L.A. mean?

14:21.200 --> 14:23.601
Loving American, no?

14:23.840 --> 14:26.605
- Look for her at this hotel.
- What hotel?

14:26.840 --> 14:32.244
This one. Look. California Hills Hotel.
It looks like she works there.

14:32.640 --> 14:34.210
Where is that?

14:36.520 --> 14:40.445
Hey, that's in Los Angeles.
I barely understand English.

14:40.640 --> 14:43.644
I hate the language.
I always flunked it.

14:44.200 --> 14:46.362
Besides, I'm broke.

14:46.640 --> 14:49.291
And you're scared of flying.
Really scared.

14:49.520 --> 14:51.761
You're crazy.
I'm not scared of planes.

14:52.320 --> 14:56.245
Well, then you have no choice
but to keep the baby.

14:57.800 --> 15:00.201
Oh! She's so beautiful.

15:00.840 --> 15:03.844
You'll end up
falling in love with her.

15:18.240 --> 15:21.323
VALENTIN:
<i>I've never been scared of airplanes.</i>

15:22.040 --> 15:23.883
It's just that...

15:24.040 --> 15:27.681
...if we go by road,
we'll save money.

15:27.880 --> 15:30.121
We'll have more time to chat.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.404
We'll have more
father-daughter moments.

15:33.560 --> 15:36.723
Now, if I return you to your mom
it doesn't mean I don't love you.

15:36.880 --> 15:40.009
It's just that you'll be
better off there.

15:40.880 --> 15:45.886
For example, movies premiere
much earlier there.

15:46.080 --> 15:48.890
<i>Just think. When Twilight
premiered here...</i>

15:49.080 --> 15:51.048
<i>...it was already
Breaking Dawn there.</i>

15:51.280 --> 15:53.851
<i>Besides, if you stay here...</i>

15:54.080 --> 15:57.721
<i>you'll be pretty,
but darker and smaller.</i>

15:58.000 --> 15:59.525
<i>But, if you grow up there...</i>

15:59.720 --> 16:03.122
<i>you'll probably
be blond, blue-eyed...</i>

16:03.360 --> 16:04.407
<i>...tall.</i>

16:04.680 --> 16:06.887
<i>Besides, here you could
get mugged any time...</i>

16:07.400 --> 16:09.687
<i>...by a thief or a cop.</i>

16:10.040 --> 16:12.691

to make her happy.

45:20.040 --> 45:21.724
But, hm...

45:22.560 --> 45:25.848
...it seems as if you're
overcompensating.

45:26.800 --> 45:30.930
What really happened
to Maggie's mother?

45:47.240 --> 45:48.924
You're right, it didn't.

45:49.080 --> 45:51.765
That's why I like you

See?

46:00.240 --> 46:02.322
You should learn from her.

I couldn't find...

script supervisor about that.

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.291
MAN 2 (IN ENGLISH):
That needs to be moved.

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:50.841
(IN ENGLISH) Uh, I feel like
I need him to be higher.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.286
- You see what I mean?
- (IN ENGLISH) Yeah.

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:56.161
Um, could you tell him
we need him to fall...

01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:59.563
...from the eighth floor
instead of the fifth?

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:04.246
(IN ENGLISH)
The eighth floor? Hm.

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.402
My dad can jump from the top floor.

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.289
- From the top floor?
- Yup.

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:11.887
That's almost twice as high.
I mean, that would be great. Uh...

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:13.405
Do you think he would do that?

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:18.721
Sure. My dad isn't afraid of anything.
He's the bravest stuntman there is.

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:20.245
And how much are we talking
about here?

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.767
- Um...
- Maggie!

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.250
What is he saying?

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:28.364
(IN SPANISH) He wants you
to jump from a little higher.

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:29.931
No, honey.

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:31.930
I can't jump from any higher.

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.923
There's not enough room.

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:37.124
I could fall outside the air mattress.
No way!

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:41.366

I told you, I need the extras.

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:44.330

DIRECTOR: Do whatever you need to do.

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:47.290
- Yeah.
- (IN ENGLISH) He says 20 grand.

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:50.762
- Twenty thousand dollars?
- Yup. Mm-hm.

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:53.969
- That's a bit too much, but, uh...
VALENTIN: Maggie!

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:57.363
Tell him I can jump
one more floor, tops.

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:04.285

to get on up there.

MAN 3 (IN ENGLISH): I have a question.

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:16.768
- What did he say?
- (IN SPANISH) He said...

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:21.403
...congratulations on being so
brave and jumping from so high.

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.002
Tell him thanks, honey, but...

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:28.643
Look, I thought it over.
No higher than the fifth floor.

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:30.649
It's too risky.

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:34.162
In fact, ask him if I can jump
from the fourth floor.

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:36.244
What did he say?

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:41.091
(IN ENGLISH)
He says he's nervous...

01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.323
...but happy to show my mom
and everyone else how brave he is.

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:49.526

I've never seen anyone like him.

the La Quebrada when he was six?

throw me from there some day...

I think the little girl was lying.

No, tell the director
I did agree.

I'm acting, you know?

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.525

01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:32.451
...I never understood
his way of raising me.

01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:34.965
I thought he hated me.

01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:37.647
I started to understand
him after you were born.

01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:39.765
Why didn't you ever call him?

01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:43.210
I was holding a grudge.

01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:48.926
I meant to look him up if
we ever came to Acapulco, but...

01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:55.206
I wanted to thank him.

01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:57.280
Give him a hug.

01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:02.011
And take him diving with us!

01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:05.966
Will you make my dream of jumping
from La Quebrada come true?

01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:09.088
MAN (IN ENGLISH): Right there.
JULIE: Frank, please.

01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:12.244
Maggie is my daughter,
not Valentin's.

01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:13.885
And I know...

01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:17.726
- I know you know where they're hiding.
- I haven't the faintest idea.

01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:21.043
Look, um, do your friend
a favor and tell him...

01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:23.971
Tell him if he comes back
voluntarily, we won't press charges.

01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:25.491
I don't know where they are.

01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:28.803
I don't think Valentin understands
the seriousness of the situation.

01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:31.008
He has kidnapped an
American child...

01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:33.845
...and to make matters worse,
she's not even his daughter.

01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:37.567
If you really consider yourself Valentin's
friend, you'll tell me where they are.

01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:41.008
I can't tell you where they
are because I don't know.

01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:42.844
And even if I knew,
I wouldn't tell you.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.162
What...?
Do you think we're stupid or what?

01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:48.927
You're covering his back.
Do you know we can have you charged...

01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:51.924
...as an accomplice in the kidnapping
of an American citizen?

01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:55.244
I'm talking to you!

01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:58.011
Okay, that's it.
I tried to be civilized.

01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:01.289
But if this is the way you want it, you're
gonna have to face the consequences.

01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:04.523
- You and that stupid, irresponsible...
- Renee. Renee.

01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:07.001
Okay, okay, you want the truth?
I'll give you the truth.

01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:09.567
That stupid, irresponsible man,
as you call him...

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:12.326
...has woken up every morning
for the past four years...

01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:15.689
...fearing that that day might be
the last day he ever gets to see...

01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:17.444
...his daughter.

01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:33.491
- Sha.
- Sha.

<i>Now I know all my Dad wanted...</i>

01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:49.644
<i>...was to make me ready.</i>

01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:52.811
<i>It was his way of telling
me that he loved me.</i>

01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:56.086
<i>Of preparing me to face life.</i>

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.526
<i>And, though my fears have
not left me altogether...</i>

01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:02.844
<i>...the wolf and I have made peace.</i>

01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:06.801
<i>It's just that during the time
Maggie and I were together...</i>

01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:10.084
<i>...we learned a thing
or two about fear...</i>

01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:11.920
<i>...and about life.</i>

01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:16.924
<i>We learned that 7 years
can count as much as 70...</i>

01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:18.525
<i>...or as 700.</i>

01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:21.922
<i>And that 10 dollars for a cab...</i>

01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:24.971
<i>...may end up being the best
investment of your life.</i>

Whoo!

01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:36.121
<i>I saw her run and wondered...</i>

01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:39.966

of hers would break.</i>

01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:36.530
<i>It didn't last long...</i>

01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:38.205
<i>...but that doesn't matter.</i>

01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:39.966
<i>It was worth it.</i>

<i>Sometimes life surprises you and...</i>

01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:48.364

<i>A little flaw... there...
in your heart.</i>

01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:57.607
<i>And then the doctor
explains to you...</i>

01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:00.363
<i>...that there is no
explanation.</i>

01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:06.562

emerging from a cocoon...</i>

01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:10.010
