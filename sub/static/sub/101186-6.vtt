WEBVTT

00:01.523 --> 00:02.524
: Previously
on Wynonna Earp.

00:02.567 --> 00:03.960
I will do anything
to get her back.

00:04.004 --> 00:06.180
I did something terrible
when you were in the Garden.

00:06.223 --> 00:08.356
-: Some kind of hex?
-To the end of the Earps.

00:08.399 --> 00:10.793
The Clantons were dickheads.
They murdered people,

00:10.836 --> 00:12.534
-stole their land.
-We're in a war, Holliday.

00:12.577 --> 00:14.231
It's just a town filled with
women would have us

00:14.275 --> 00:16.668
both fight to the death.
-Peacemaker, come!

00:16.712 --> 00:19.149
I want the woman
in the painting.

00:19.193 --> 00:21.543
-: Rosita?!
-We need to focus on a cure.

00:21.586 --> 00:23.023
Where we drown you
in salted holy water.

00:23.066 --> 00:24.024
I love you.

00:25.808 --> 00:30.247
Hey, I know how this looks,
but I'm asking you to trust us.

00:34.425 --> 00:36.210
Oh!

00:36.253 --> 00:37.689
Okay, that's cold.

00:39.082 --> 00:40.083
How you doing?

00:40.127 --> 00:42.607
Like I'm about
35 shades of grey.

00:42.651 --> 00:44.696
Is this much kink
necessary to break a spell?

00:44.740 --> 00:48.004
Technically it's an exorcism.
So... yep.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.919
Also, who was it
that cursed you again?

00:49.962 --> 00:51.747
The--

00:51.790 --> 00:53.879
Jeremy, you know I can't say it
without barfing frogs!

00:53.923 --> 00:56.404
Sorry. Just, final test...

00:56.447 --> 00:58.232
before you temporarily drown.

00:59.276 --> 01:01.017
Super temporarily.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.801
Once the hourglass runs out,
we bring you back,

01:02.845 --> 01:04.238
spell's broken,
and we all go out

01:04.281 --> 01:07.023
for veggie burgers
and flies-- fries.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.199
Fries. Here.

01:10.157 --> 01:11.723
Oh, she's froggin' gorgeous.

01:11.767 --> 01:13.899
Well, I picked the cutest,
deadest one in the bucket.

01:13.943 --> 01:14.944
Let's hop to it.

01:14.987 --> 01:16.728
Grab that hex and ribbit
right out!

01:16.772 --> 01:18.295
If you guys are gonna
to keep this up,

01:18.339 --> 01:20.297
would you drown me instead?

01:20.341 --> 01:21.342
We wouldn't be doing this

01:21.385 --> 01:23.170
if we weren't sure
it would work.

01:23.213 --> 01:25.476
Yeah. And if we didn't
have any other options.

01:26.521 --> 01:29.306
Okay. So we're gonna monitor
your vitals.

01:33.615 --> 01:35.617
Leave everything to magic,

01:35.660 --> 01:38.141
nothing to chance.

01:39.969 --> 01:41.318
-You ready?
-Well, I'd rather not

01:41.362 --> 01:43.451
keep barfing frogs
and trying to kill my friends.

01:43.494 --> 01:45.366
So, yeah.

01:45.409 --> 01:46.802
Okay. Once you're under,

01:46.845 --> 01:49.631
your consciousness
should transfer to the frog.

01:49.674 --> 01:50.936
Two will become one.

01:50.980 --> 01:52.590
My favorite Spice Girls song.

01:52.634 --> 01:54.418
It's gotta be a good sign!

01:54.462 --> 01:55.637
One with the frog.

01:56.507 --> 01:57.508
Okay...

01:59.031 --> 02:00.598
-Hey.
-Hey.

02:01.773 --> 02:03.210
No matter what happens,
don't let me come up

02:03.253 --> 02:04.994
until it's done. Okay?

02:06.604 --> 02:07.344
Okay.

02:08.606 --> 02:11.218
And guys... Thank you.

02:16.701 --> 02:17.615
Okay.

02:39.115 --> 02:40.899
Okay, okay.

02:40.943 --> 02:42.684
Her heart rate's
slowing down. Okay, good.

02:42.727 --> 02:43.467
Good.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.472
Oh no. Her survival instincts
are kicking in!

02:49.647 --> 02:51.475
Sorry, Nicole,
either I kill you now,

02:51.519 --> 02:52.737
or you kill me later!

02:52.781 --> 02:54.435
Keep incantating!

03:04.358 --> 03:05.837
Okay. It's done.

03:07.839 --> 03:10.364
Jeremy! What the hell
are you doing?

03:12.583 --> 03:13.367
Oh no.

03:14.281 --> 03:16.500
Okay, I know how this looks,

03:16.544 --> 03:18.023
but I'm asking you to trust us.

03:25.117 --> 03:26.293
Waverly! Don't interfere!

03:26.336 --> 03:28.773
I'm gonna interfere
with your friggin' face!

03:28.817 --> 03:30.297
What the hell did you do?

03:31.428 --> 03:33.082
Is she dead?

03:33.125 --> 03:34.170
Technically...

03:35.476 --> 03:37.913
-Yes! It worked!

03:37.956 --> 03:39.828
-It worked!
-What? What worked?

03:39.871 --> 03:41.395
Can't you see?
She's in the frog!

03:43.048 --> 03:45.442
You put my girlfriend
into a frog?

03:46.356 --> 03:47.357
And you're welcome.

03:56.323 --> 03:58.629
Dead? Not quite.

04:00.805 --> 04:03.112
Testing our bonds, are you?

04:03.155 --> 04:05.680
Well, it ain't that easy, Missy.

04:05.723 --> 04:07.421
What I gave, I can take.

04:07.464 --> 04:08.857
Yes. That will do.

04:13.949 --> 04:16.168
An eye for an eye,
a breath for a breath,

04:16.212 --> 04:18.910
seek and destroy,
and be joined in death.

04:30.008 --> 04:32.010
Waverly Earp.

04:32.054 --> 04:34.012
Onward, my boy.

04:41.803 --> 04:44.980
♪ 'Cause I gave you
all I got to give ♪

04:45.023 --> 04:46.851
♪ I know that ain't
no way to live ♪

04:46.895 --> 04:50.072
♪ So I told that devil

04:50.115 --> 04:52.379
♪ To take you back

04:52.422 --> 04:55.164
♪ I told that devil

04:55.207 --> 04:57.340
♪ To take you back

04:58.385 --> 05:00.343
-It was her idea!
-What was?!

05:00.387 --> 05:02.519
Handcuffing you to the bed,
the exorcism.

05:02.563 --> 05:04.434
She knew you'd try
and stop her.

05:04.478 --> 05:06.175
-Look. According to the Maglu,

05:06.218 --> 05:07.742
if we can't destroy
the spell-caster,

05:07.785 --> 05:09.570
then we must cleanse
the one who's been cursed.

05:09.613 --> 05:11.180
What, by drowning her?!

05:11.223 --> 05:12.616
Temporarily.

05:12.660 --> 05:15.315
Waves, as long as she stays
in the frog, she's okay.

05:16.881 --> 05:18.622
She's not a strong swimmer.

05:18.666 --> 05:20.624
Once the timer runs out,
the hex will be broken,

05:20.668 --> 05:23.192
and we'll slowly revive her
without risking brain damage.

05:24.411 --> 05:27.414
If you want to help,
just watch the frog.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.028
Okay...

05:38.816 --> 05:42.037
Hi, sweetie-pie, it's me.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.256
Are you really in there?

05:52.221 --> 05:54.266
Rosita?! Of all the Revenants
who could have survived,

05:54.310 --> 05:55.877
it's busty, brainy,

05:55.920 --> 05:57.922
baby-stealing Ro-fucking-sita?

05:57.966 --> 05:59.794
-So this is it.
-This is what?

05:59.837 --> 06:02.274
Seventy-six down, one to go.

06:02.318 --> 06:03.667
You're gonna kill me last,
like you said.

06:03.711 --> 06:06.191
-Done.
-There will be no killing.

06:06.235 --> 06:08.455
As much as I also crave
the satisfaction...

06:09.673 --> 06:10.848
We need you alive.

06:12.937 --> 06:14.504
It's your lucky day.

06:14.548 --> 06:16.724
-Come on.
-I can't, dummies!

06:16.767 --> 06:20.249
Look, a year ago, maybe more,
there was this rumble,

06:20.292 --> 06:21.468
some kind of earthquake.

06:21.511 --> 06:23.078
Yeah. It was a doozy,
we were all shook.

06:23.121 --> 06:24.384
You remember Creepy Phil?

06:25.863 --> 06:27.169
The Revenant with all
the boils?

06:27.212 --> 06:29.606
For reasons that are
unimportant right now,

06:30.651 --> 06:32.566
he rounded up a posse
to hunt me down.

06:32.609 --> 06:34.306
Did you steal his baby too?

06:34.350 --> 06:35.395
I slept with his wife.

06:36.744 --> 06:38.267
How nefarious.

06:38.310 --> 06:40.138
I for one would love
to hear more.

06:43.490 --> 06:46.623
So, I ran to the only place
that I thought I'd be safe.

06:46.667 --> 06:47.972
This outcropping?

06:48.016 --> 06:50.758
Revenants said stepping on it
made you feel

06:50.801 --> 06:53.500
like you were turning
inside out.

06:53.543 --> 06:55.719
But I've always had
a high pain tolerance.

06:55.763 --> 06:56.851
Doc, you know that.

06:58.200 --> 07:01.159
Anyway, I ran here,
with Phil and his posse

07:01.203 --> 07:03.335
right on my tail,
and the rumbling got louder,

07:03.379 --> 07:05.468
and then all
of the Revenants...

07:05.512 --> 07:07.862
poofed, one by one.

07:07.905 --> 07:09.994
Leaving you
with boil-faced Phil

07:10.038 --> 07:11.039
on inside-out-Island.

07:11.082 --> 07:13.345
Yeah.
Except something changed.

07:13.389 --> 07:15.652
We couldn't feel the pain
anymore.

07:15.696 --> 07:18.133
And then Phil got handsy, so...

07:18.176 --> 07:19.613
I kicked the bastard
in the throat,

07:19.656 --> 07:21.266
he fell off the rock,
and poof,

07:21.310 --> 07:22.833
disappeared
with the rest of them.

07:22.877 --> 07:24.835
Yeah, he did! Forget Phil.

07:24.879 --> 07:26.924
Look,
it doesn't take a genius,

07:26.968 --> 07:28.404
although I actually am one,

07:28.448 --> 07:31.886
to figure out if he poofed,
then so would I.

07:32.887 --> 07:34.236
Look, it's been great
catching up,

07:34.279 --> 07:37.195
but I can't leave this island.

07:37.239 --> 07:38.936
Now what?

07:38.980 --> 07:41.330
Tie her up and hope she doesn't
spontaneously combust?

07:41.373 --> 07:43.506
I don't need to know what
you two got up to in the sack.

07:44.551 --> 07:46.727
-Look.
-Ammolite.

07:46.770 --> 07:48.598
Revenant Kryptonite.

07:48.642 --> 07:50.731
This rock formation
hurt Revenants

07:50.774 --> 07:52.210
before the curse was broken.

07:52.254 --> 07:53.777
So now, it must protect them.

07:53.821 --> 07:55.518
If there's more, we can get...

07:55.562 --> 07:57.477
: ...Rosita
off the island.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.914
-The tribe has spoken.
-Tribe?

07:59.957 --> 08:02.220
Just find more rainbow rocks
before I change my mind

08:02.264 --> 08:03.874
and break her silky smooth neck.

08:05.572 --> 08:06.790
Pick up, pick up, pick up!

08:06.834 --> 08:08.270
: Hi,
this is Waverly!

08:08.313 --> 08:09.880
Leave a message,
and I'll ring-a-ding

08:09.924 --> 08:12.013
-you right back!
-Oh shit-- Ahh!

08:12.056 --> 08:13.928
Look what I got here.
The little Earp lover.

08:13.971 --> 08:15.451
Poking her nose
where it don't belong.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.453
-Who sent you?
-Get bent.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.586
-Was it Holliday?
-It was nobody! Let me go!

08:19.629 --> 08:22.240
Sorry, Miss, no can do.

08:22.284 --> 08:24.373
You brought this on yourself.

08:24.416 --> 08:25.679
What are you going to do?

08:25.722 --> 08:27.811
I need to make a call! Stop it!

08:29.204 --> 08:32.076
Okay, her temperature
is stable.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.948
Her heartbeat's been stopped
for almost five minutes.

08:33.991 --> 08:35.515
Waverly? How much more time?

08:35.558 --> 08:37.125
I don't know, forever?

08:37.168 --> 08:39.780
-Next time, I'll get quicksand.

08:39.823 --> 08:41.564
Wait! Okay!
It's done. It's done!

08:41.608 --> 08:43.261
What, is the spell broken?
Is she free?

08:43.305 --> 08:45.089
We won't know
until she wakes up.

08:45.133 --> 08:47.527
-You can that stop now.
-Oh. Thank Christ.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.137
And start
the reversal incantation.

08:49.180 --> 08:50.921
-Reversal?
-Yeah, we have to get her

08:50.965 --> 08:52.575
out of the frog,
and back into her body.

08:52.619 --> 08:55.404
Can I at least get a...
Oh. Thank you.

08:55.447 --> 08:57.406
Please guys, hurry!

09:00.017 --> 09:00.975
What are you waiting for!?

09:01.018 --> 09:02.542
She's definitely
gonna punch me.

09:02.585 --> 09:05.153
-Jeremy!
-No! Don't use those on her!

09:05.196 --> 09:06.676
-Why not?
-Of course,

09:06.720 --> 09:08.765
-because of the water!
-You can't paddle a flat-liner,

09:08.809 --> 09:11.115
-Dr. Dingus!
-Well okay, then what do I do?

09:13.988 --> 09:15.206
What was that?

09:15.250 --> 09:17.078
I don't know. The wind?

09:19.123 --> 09:19.863
Waverly?

09:21.952 --> 09:22.997
I've been marked.

09:29.394 --> 09:31.309
Billy! You're a Reaper now?

09:32.397 --> 09:33.877
-What do you want?
-I don't know.

09:33.921 --> 09:36.227
-To bring back Nicole's vitals!
-Not you! The Reaper!

09:38.186 --> 09:39.535
What the hell are you doing?

09:39.579 --> 09:43.147
Can't you see it?
Oh, the fudging Clantons!

09:43.191 --> 09:45.628
I've been marked!

09:45.672 --> 09:47.717
Oh, guys?

09:47.761 --> 09:50.894
It... She got out.

09:50.938 --> 09:53.027
No, no, no, no! Nicole?!

09:53.070 --> 09:57.597
Nicole! Whatever happens,
stay in that frog!

09:57.640 --> 09:58.380
Please!

10:00.861 --> 10:03.124
Okay! Oh, hey, hi, Nicole!

10:03.167 --> 10:04.560
Oh, you're so cute. Okay.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.561
No, no.

10:08.390 --> 10:10.131
Okay, I got you, Nicole.

10:10.174 --> 10:12.960
Oh! Argh! Nicole!
Come back here!

10:13.003 --> 10:15.440
Please, please! No!

10:17.225 --> 10:17.965
: No!

10:28.323 --> 10:29.367
Holy shit!

10:34.285 --> 10:35.547
Did you stop it?

10:35.591 --> 10:36.505
Maybe?

10:37.985 --> 10:40.422
No, baby. I did.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.342
That's it?

10:47.385 --> 10:48.909
There isn't much.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.519
Ammolite is a rarity.

10:50.562 --> 10:51.607
How are we gonna get her

10:51.651 --> 10:53.087
all the way back
to the sanctuary?

10:53.130 --> 10:54.871
Back stone moves
to front. Repeat.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.004
Alright.

10:58.135 --> 10:59.397
Rosita? Follow the path.

10:59.441 --> 11:00.747
The ammolite
will keep you safe.

11:00.790 --> 11:03.227
Yeah. From searing agony,
or you?

11:04.272 --> 11:06.317
The rumbling you heard
was Bulshar

11:06.361 --> 11:07.710
ending the curse, alright?

11:07.754 --> 11:09.799
There's no Earp vs. Revenant
thing anymore.

11:09.843 --> 11:11.453
We're good.
We don't need to fight.

11:13.803 --> 11:14.761
It was your baby too.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.939
I suppose you did
what you did to survive.

11:21.332 --> 11:22.290
And I forgive you.

11:24.640 --> 11:27.338
Totes. Water under the bridge.

11:27.382 --> 11:28.731
Yeah, mega convincing.

11:28.775 --> 11:30.385
I can smell the grudge on you

11:30.428 --> 11:32.387
like stale beer and Bubba Kush.

11:32.430 --> 11:35.085
That's actually the smell
of my house almost burning down.

11:35.129 --> 11:36.347
Pinky swear you won't hurt me.

11:38.262 --> 11:41.309
-How old are you?
-Pinky swear!

11:41.352 --> 11:42.702
Oh, my God.

11:44.355 --> 11:46.662
We hereby pinky swear

11:46.706 --> 11:49.099
that we'll not harm a hair
on your head.

11:49.143 --> 11:51.145
Or anywhere else on my body.

11:52.059 --> 11:53.582
The devil's in the details!

11:53.625 --> 11:55.236
Alright, whatever.

11:56.498 --> 11:57.238
Come on.

11:58.848 --> 11:59.719
Okay.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.642
Oh, my God. I did it!

12:12.383 --> 12:13.950
And I don't feel anything.

12:13.994 --> 12:16.083
Oh, thank you!

12:16.126 --> 12:17.301
Oh! Whoa!

12:18.215 --> 12:20.174
God, I forgot
how good you smell.

12:20.217 --> 12:21.044
Thanks.

12:22.045 --> 12:23.568
Wait, careful!

12:23.612 --> 12:24.656
Can't have you poofing
out on us.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.093
Okay.

12:28.095 --> 12:29.487
What is that?

12:29.531 --> 12:32.142
The Celtic Sisters knot
has appeared once more.

12:33.622 --> 12:36.320
It's a shortcut. You coming?

12:36.364 --> 12:38.540
To be among a plethora
of women scorned?

12:38.583 --> 12:41.804
Doubt I'd be welcome, long as I
got Richard and The Twins.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.632
Alright. On three
we step through.

12:43.675 --> 12:45.286
Wait, what, women scorned?

12:45.329 --> 12:46.243
And three!

12:52.162 --> 12:53.990
Sheriff Clayborn?

12:54.034 --> 12:55.426
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

12:56.776 --> 12:59.039
Okay, so we have to figure out
which frog she's in.

12:59.082 --> 13:00.475
Can we talk about this outfit?

13:00.518 --> 13:02.346
This would be so much easier
if frogs had hair.

13:02.390 --> 13:05.001
Come on, baby,
just give me a sign!

13:05.045 --> 13:06.307
-I'm trying.
-A few more minutes,

13:06.350 --> 13:08.439
and she's gonna have
permanent brain damage.

13:08.483 --> 13:09.789
Much more,
and it'll be too late.

13:11.007 --> 13:12.313
Okay, well...

13:12.356 --> 13:13.967
-Should I kiss them?
-Worth a shot.

13:14.010 --> 13:16.708
Uh, no! No, it is not!
I am not in the frog!

13:16.752 --> 13:19.494
Okay, come here,
little princess.

13:19.537 --> 13:21.365
Just keep your tongue
to yourself, okay?

13:26.196 --> 13:27.850
Okay. Did it.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.721
-Yeah.
-Think she liked it?

13:29.765 --> 13:30.679
Yeah, definitely.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.333
Ah. So gross.

13:34.074 --> 13:35.989
Alright, Sister
Granny Panties! Here she be.

13:36.032 --> 13:37.773
A woman scorned.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.862
My, you've done well,
Wynonna Earp.

13:39.906 --> 13:42.212
Well, you want worthy,
you come to the best.

13:42.256 --> 13:43.170
She's all yours.

13:44.301 --> 13:46.347
-Hand over Peacemaker.
-What the hell?!

13:46.390 --> 13:47.435
You're trading me?

13:47.478 --> 13:48.828
It's better than killing you.

13:49.785 --> 13:50.655
Forgiveness?

13:52.005 --> 13:53.484
Well now look
who's carrying a grudge.

13:53.528 --> 13:54.224
My gun?

13:55.922 --> 13:57.140
What are they gonna
do with me?

13:57.184 --> 13:58.011
I didn't ask.

13:59.360 --> 14:00.840
I just need to save my friend.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.581
There was a time I thought
you and I were friends.

14:03.625 --> 14:06.846
Rosita,
it's just survival.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.891
Why does it always involve
women betraying women?

14:08.935 --> 14:10.588
Just as I had hoped.

14:10.632 --> 14:13.026
There is something between you.

14:13.069 --> 14:14.941
Something delicious.

14:14.984 --> 14:17.682
The derision. The disdain.

14:17.726 --> 14:19.554
It would be a shame to waste it.

14:19.597 --> 14:21.164
Lady, if shame's
what you're after,

14:21.208 --> 14:24.254
I've got three seasons
of Flavor of Love on DVD, okay?

14:24.298 --> 14:25.908
I don't give a rat's ass
about Rosita,

14:25.952 --> 14:27.388
I just want my gun.

14:27.431 --> 14:28.868
And you shall have it.

14:28.911 --> 14:32.697
And a step closer to salvation.
If you live.

14:32.741 --> 14:34.525
-What?
-What?

14:34.569 --> 14:36.614
-Battle to the death!

14:38.094 --> 14:40.531
Okay, alright. Listen.

14:40.575 --> 14:41.750
Sure we've had our ishes,

14:41.793 --> 14:43.186
but there's no way
we're gonna--

14:56.025 --> 14:58.549
♪ Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
where'd you go ♪

14:58.593 --> 14:59.681
Ahh!

15:00.812 --> 15:02.727
What happened to women
betraying women?

15:02.771 --> 15:04.033
I saw an opening,
I jumped on it!

15:04.077 --> 15:06.122
I'll say, you're like
a sexy spider monkey!

15:06.166 --> 15:08.124
-You lied!
-I promised not to hurt you.

15:08.168 --> 15:10.213
So help me God!
I'm trying to keep my word!

15:10.257 --> 15:14.174
Enough talk! Give in
to what you desire. Fight!

15:14.217 --> 15:17.177
-You know what? Fuck it!

15:17.220 --> 15:19.527
If I have to go through you
to get Peacemaker, I will.

15:19.570 --> 15:21.833
I've fended off death
for 140 years.

15:21.877 --> 15:23.357
I'm great at not dying.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.011
Then remove
those tacky-ass hoops.

15:25.054 --> 15:26.099
Oh yeah?

15:29.189 --> 15:30.103
Bring it.

15:43.246 --> 15:45.553
Bitch, I have a lifetime
of settling arguments

15:45.596 --> 15:48.034
with my fists and level three
BBD hand-to-hand combat.

15:48.077 --> 15:50.340
And I got a big ole boot.

15:50.384 --> 15:51.602
Son of a bitch!

15:54.040 --> 15:56.085
-Well?
-Nope.

15:56.129 --> 15:58.348
-I'm not feelin' it.
-That was the last one.

15:58.392 --> 16:01.177
I can't believe she's not
trying to give us a sign.

16:01.221 --> 16:04.006
There's never a damn
pottery wheel when you need one!

16:04.050 --> 16:07.357
Ugh! I am! I just don't know
the rules of Ghost!

16:08.706 --> 16:10.317
Um...

16:10.360 --> 16:12.014
Okay, what if...

16:16.323 --> 16:17.193
Okay.

16:19.717 --> 16:22.155
Oh, man. Now what
is with this light?

16:22.198 --> 16:24.200
Oh, God,
I'm gonna have a seizure.

16:24.244 --> 16:26.159
That's a pattern.
That could be a code.

16:26.202 --> 16:27.856
You're right! Morse code!

16:27.899 --> 16:30.467
Yes! Baby, you never cease
to surprise me.

16:30.511 --> 16:32.513
Okay. Uh... N.

16:32.556 --> 16:35.037
N... O... T. Not.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.038
I...

16:36.082 --> 16:36.996
N...

16:38.084 --> 16:40.564
F... R...

16:40.608 --> 16:42.697
O... G.

16:42.740 --> 16:44.742
No, no, that's a B.
Not in frob?

16:44.786 --> 16:46.396
-Ugh! Close enough!
-Close enough!

16:46.440 --> 16:47.876
Okay, geez!
She's not in the frog.

16:49.095 --> 16:51.271
But she is still here, right?
Somewhere.

16:52.272 --> 16:53.447
Astral-projection.

16:53.490 --> 16:54.926
People say it can occur
near death.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.450
Happened to me,
my third heart attack.

16:56.493 --> 16:58.104
Found my remote
on top of the fridge.

16:58.147 --> 17:00.541
Okay. Nicole, we can hear you!
What do we do?

17:03.370 --> 17:06.025
B... A...

17:06.068 --> 17:09.158
S... E...

17:09.202 --> 17:12.074
-M... E...
-Basement. Basement.

17:12.118 --> 17:13.510
Yeah. She wants us
to go down there.

17:13.554 --> 17:15.860
W-With the Reaper?

17:15.904 --> 17:19.168
But that's insane! Nicole,
is that what you're saying?

17:19.212 --> 17:22.563
D... U... H.

17:22.606 --> 17:24.173
Well, that's her, alright.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.176
Okay.

17:27.220 --> 17:29.613
So you're gonna chat
with Nicole, through a creeper?

17:29.657 --> 17:30.832
Reaper.

17:30.875 --> 17:32.616
Someone in this room
made it their bitch,

17:32.660 --> 17:34.096
and then tossed it
down the stairs,

17:34.140 --> 17:37.273
and I think that someone
was a ginger goddess.

17:37.317 --> 17:39.971
Besides, anyone got
a better idea?

17:40.015 --> 17:42.365
Okay. I'll have to lower
her body temp to buy some time.

17:42.409 --> 17:44.237
Like a frog
hibernating in winter.

17:44.280 --> 17:45.673
Slowing down bodily functions

17:45.716 --> 17:47.066
to prevent
cell deterioration.

17:47.109 --> 17:49.807
-Great.
-But, if we lose the body,

17:49.851 --> 17:51.679
I don't know what happens
to the spirit.

17:52.897 --> 17:54.421
-Ready?
-Yep.

17:54.464 --> 17:55.596
Good luck.

17:55.639 --> 17:57.163
-Come on.
-I have no fucking clue

17:57.206 --> 17:58.860
what's happening here,
but when in doubt...

18:09.088 --> 18:10.654
Nice Reaper.

18:17.052 --> 18:19.228
Billy, what did
they do to you?

18:19.272 --> 18:22.927
: Gave me the might
of a thousand ancestors.

18:22.971 --> 18:23.928
Nicole?

18:25.278 --> 18:27.845
Are you...
Are you in the Reaper?

18:29.282 --> 18:30.500
: Tell her why I did it.

18:30.544 --> 18:31.980
Tell her why I made
the deal with the witch!

18:32.023 --> 18:33.068
Yes, tell me.

18:33.982 --> 18:35.462
: You will now die!

18:35.505 --> 18:38.073
I've got him dead-to-rights!

18:38.117 --> 18:39.596
-Maybe.
-No! Don't shoot!

18:39.640 --> 18:40.815
It's Nicole now!

18:40.858 --> 18:42.295
I thought
she was a goddamn frog!

18:42.338 --> 18:44.514
She is a frog, and dead!

18:44.558 --> 18:47.300
And also a Reaper.
Stay with the plot, Nedley!

18:47.343 --> 18:49.171
Nicole, you are
gonna tell me everything.

18:49.215 --> 18:51.695
Because if I you don't,
the love of my life might die,

18:51.739 --> 18:54.002
and I'll get very angry,
and I don't even know

18:54.045 --> 18:56.004
what might happen
if I get very angry.

18:56.047 --> 18:57.701
-Got it?

19:00.661 --> 19:03.054
To the death! Or you'll never
see your little toy again!

19:03.098 --> 19:04.795
You know what? If you had
your own little toy,

19:04.839 --> 19:05.840
maybe you wouldn't be
so uptight!

19:09.017 --> 19:10.801
Can you believe this shit?

19:16.459 --> 19:17.808
You're all out of tricks,
Earp.

19:17.852 --> 19:19.332
-Not quite.
-Ahh!

19:19.375 --> 19:20.376
Oh!

19:23.074 --> 19:25.164
-Thank you, Dolls.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.948
Why are you playing
the old hag's game?

19:26.991 --> 19:28.689
I am a survivor.

19:28.732 --> 19:31.213
Last words that'll look
super ironic on your tombstone.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.693
The more you choke,
the harder I get.

19:32.736 --> 19:34.042
Okay, boner.

19:35.348 --> 19:36.175
Finish her!

19:37.306 --> 19:38.699
-Demon nun.
-Of course.

19:38.742 --> 19:40.353
-Ugh...
-Listen.

19:40.396 --> 19:41.832
-Yeah?
-We don't find my gun,

19:41.876 --> 19:43.399
-we're both dead.
-Okay.

19:45.009 --> 19:47.490
Is that a Hemsworth
in biking shorts?

19:47.534 --> 19:49.100
A Xena reboot!

19:49.144 --> 19:50.101
That's nice!

19:52.365 --> 19:53.844
After them!

19:53.888 --> 19:56.673
: She's ours.
We have her soul.

19:56.717 --> 19:58.545
She made a covenant.
A life for a life.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.286
W-Why would she...

20:01.504 --> 20:04.377
Why would you make a deal
with the friggin' Clantons?

20:05.465 --> 20:07.380
I didn't know
it was them, okay?

20:07.423 --> 20:10.470
I waited 18 months.
I was desperate.

20:10.513 --> 20:12.472
I should have believed
that you'd find a way home.

20:12.515 --> 20:13.473
I'm sorry.

20:15.431 --> 20:16.954
You will eat your own.

20:16.998 --> 20:19.218
And I'm about to make you
eat baseball bat!

20:19.261 --> 20:20.610
So how do we break
the covenant?

20:20.654 --> 20:22.046
Impossible!

20:22.090 --> 20:23.744
The Swamp Witch has bound her.

20:23.787 --> 20:26.616
The covenant only ends
when both actors die.

20:28.314 --> 20:30.577
One down, one to go.

20:31.665 --> 20:33.144
I will fix this, Nicole.

20:34.711 --> 20:36.626
No. Baby, stop.

20:38.324 --> 20:39.150
We are many.

20:40.151 --> 20:42.284
I'll take my chances, thanks.

20:49.900 --> 20:51.424
How many?

20:56.559 --> 20:57.995
Do not let that thing out.

20:58.039 --> 20:59.388
Gonna need Annabelle.

20:59.432 --> 21:00.955
What? Where are you going?

21:00.998 --> 21:03.305
To have a little chat
with the Swamp Witch.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.873
This ain't no talking stick.
I'm coming with you.

21:05.916 --> 21:08.354
Randy, there's a Reaper
in the basement,

21:08.397 --> 21:10.617
and my girlfriend is being
shocked like French beans.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.314
Margo-Jean's son
is the Sheriff.

21:12.358 --> 21:13.663
There are still laws.

21:13.707 --> 21:15.448
Well, if Mam Clanton
put the spell on her,

21:15.491 --> 21:16.579
it might be the only way.

21:26.328 --> 21:27.155
Nicole?

21:35.337 --> 21:36.686
You saved my life.

21:38.079 --> 21:39.254
Now it's my turn.

21:40.386 --> 21:42.344
Okay, so as soon
as Wynonna gets back

21:42.388 --> 21:44.085
-with Peacemaker we--
-We don't have time!

21:44.955 --> 21:46.217
Your plan didn't work!

21:46.261 --> 21:47.654
Nicole wouldn't want it
this way.

21:47.697 --> 21:49.743
If I don't end Mam Clanton,

21:49.786 --> 21:52.963
there might not be a Nicole
to want anything.

21:53.007 --> 21:55.488
Keep her alive.
For as long as you can.

22:05.802 --> 22:07.369
You'll be safe in here.

22:07.413 --> 22:09.632
Yeah, sure. Which one of these
pointy-shooty things

22:09.676 --> 22:10.938
are you gonna kill me with?

22:10.981 --> 22:12.331
Depends.

22:12.374 --> 22:14.637
You gotten enough
off your ample, perfect chest?

22:16.073 --> 22:18.162
Guess we can call a truce.

22:18.206 --> 22:19.512
Good.

22:19.555 --> 22:20.948
'Cause I am sick
and goddamn tired

22:20.991 --> 22:22.732
of being told who to kill.

22:22.776 --> 22:24.647
It's bad enough I have
the Clantons halfway up my hoop,

22:24.691 --> 22:26.301
I don't need beef with you too.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.651
-Clantons?

22:31.611 --> 22:32.873
Grab something.

22:32.916 --> 22:34.918
And keep an eye out
for a big-ass Buntline.

22:38.792 --> 22:40.315
She is lying.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.535
Gen Z knows more than she says,
we cannot let her live!

22:42.578 --> 22:43.840
Just stay out of it, Cleo.

22:43.884 --> 22:46.408
-Holt, we...
-Mr. Holliday! Come on in.

22:48.758 --> 22:50.804
Well, go figure.
Someone does care about you.

22:50.847 --> 22:52.196
You owe me five bucks.

22:52.240 --> 22:53.850
Take it out of whatever
it's gonna cost me

22:53.894 --> 22:55.156
to bail you out.

22:55.199 --> 22:56.418
I'm not interested
in your money.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.289
Well then,
what do you propose?

22:58.333 --> 23:01.423
-Ooh! Dance-off. Let's do this.
-You can have this back.

23:01.467 --> 23:03.164
Now go out there
and stare at it for a while.

23:10.127 --> 23:13.392
I wanted to talk to you,
man to man.

23:14.349 --> 23:15.959
I've been thinking about
what you said.

23:17.221 --> 23:18.614
The blood we shed damns us all.

23:20.486 --> 23:21.965
I'm tired, Holliday.

23:22.009 --> 23:23.576
I'm tired of this fight.

23:24.707 --> 23:26.492
Having a beef with enemies,

23:26.535 --> 23:28.058
people that I barely even know,

23:28.102 --> 23:30.974
because my ancestors
lost an unfair shootout.

23:31.018 --> 23:32.193
No disrespect,

23:32.236 --> 23:34.325
but your ancestors
were drunken assholes.

23:34.369 --> 23:37.198
-As were your friends, and...
-I was their Asshole King.

23:39.243 --> 23:40.593
But people can change.

23:41.942 --> 23:42.725
I believe that.

23:44.031 --> 23:46.294
I got a job now.
Where I can do some real good.

23:47.295 --> 23:50.080
And... there's a woman
who works at the diner.

23:50.124 --> 23:51.865
And I would love
nothing more than to be able

23:51.908 --> 23:54.171
to invite her out to dinner
at Shorty's.

23:54.215 --> 23:55.477
And not have to worry
about an Earp

23:55.521 --> 23:56.783
shooting me in the back.

23:59.002 --> 23:59.742
So...

24:01.004 --> 24:03.485
We set enmity aside
for the sake of those

24:03.529 --> 24:05.705
that bear our name,
present and future?

24:05.748 --> 24:06.880
Not the past?

24:06.923 --> 24:09.404
I am damn near
170 years old, Sheriff.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.059
The past is but a burden.
What's done is done.

24:13.277 --> 24:14.496
And as for Rachel?

24:15.758 --> 24:17.630
Well, she made Billy happy.

24:17.673 --> 24:18.500
He was a...

24:19.458 --> 24:20.676
He is a good kid.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.417
He's never been poisoned
by the Clanton hate.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.419
I believe it was the Bard
that wrote about

24:24.463 --> 24:26.900
two love-struck kids
subverting a family vendetta.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.251
Let us hope it's not too late

24:30.294 --> 24:32.166
to give their story
a happier ending.

24:34.429 --> 24:37.519
I will bring our proposition
to Margo-Jean,

24:37.563 --> 24:38.607
if you bring it to the Earps.

24:40.261 --> 24:41.436
Thank you, Doc Holliday.

24:42.655 --> 24:45.222
That still sounds weird.

24:46.485 --> 24:47.747
Well, let this be
the beginning

24:47.790 --> 24:49.270
of a new chronicle...

24:52.447 --> 24:53.535
Our own.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.979
No magic gun? Sword?

25:03.023 --> 25:05.721
Hmm. No. No ammo either.

25:07.593 --> 25:09.246
Overcompensating battle axe
it is.

25:11.205 --> 25:12.467
The falsetto fuck
is that noise?

25:14.121 --> 25:15.905
It's a requiem.

25:15.949 --> 25:17.211
A mass for the dead.

25:19.213 --> 25:21.607
Of whom I'm glad
you're not one?

25:21.650 --> 25:22.608
Oh, grammar.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.002
You surviving
makes me feel decent.

25:26.046 --> 25:27.351
I don't play well
with the other gals,

25:27.395 --> 25:28.396
but we could've hung out.

25:28.439 --> 25:30.137
Well, up until you...

25:31.660 --> 25:33.401
Look, if the Earp Curse
is done, Wynonna,

25:33.444 --> 25:34.968
then why do you
still need Peacemaker?

25:35.011 --> 25:36.883
Because my work isn't done.

25:38.362 --> 25:40.321
: Open the door!

25:40.364 --> 25:42.062
And neither is yours!

25:43.803 --> 25:45.631
With your holier-than-thou
attitude,

25:45.674 --> 25:48.329
deciding who gets to wield
your rusty ass!

25:49.460 --> 25:51.201
You think I'm not worthy?

25:53.029 --> 25:54.988
Judgy tool!

25:55.031 --> 25:57.294
You're the one hiding
like a little bitch!

25:58.861 --> 26:00.080
Wynonna! They're coming!

26:00.950 --> 26:03.518
The curse may be over,
but you know what?

26:03.562 --> 26:07.174
Our enemies won't stop coming
just because we want them to!

26:08.915 --> 26:11.265
And I know you want what I want!

26:13.223 --> 26:14.703
To keep kicking evil ass.

26:17.663 --> 26:18.968
Enough bullshit!

26:20.840 --> 26:23.277
I do what needs to be done
because I'm a hero!

26:24.670 --> 26:26.280
You know what, yeah,

26:26.323 --> 26:29.892
sometimes...
that makes me a killer.

26:34.331 --> 26:37.596
If you won't fight,
you're both going to die!

26:44.211 --> 26:45.647
Holy fuck.

26:50.652 --> 26:51.871
Come to Mamma.

26:57.833 --> 26:59.226
Hey, sexy.

27:03.970 --> 27:05.188
Missed you too.

27:05.232 --> 27:07.364
I am Medea.

27:07.408 --> 27:09.584
Granddaughter of Helios.

27:09.628 --> 27:13.980
Trifle with a woman scorned
at your own peril.

27:17.287 --> 27:18.593
Man-made weapons?

27:20.943 --> 27:22.858
: We keep them here
so you fools

27:22.902 --> 27:25.034
won't harm yourself.

27:25.078 --> 27:26.688
You wanna tell her?

27:26.732 --> 27:27.471
Nah.

27:31.301 --> 27:32.520
Make your peace.

27:33.608 --> 27:34.827
Fool.

27:40.615 --> 27:41.572
That felt good.

27:44.750 --> 27:45.968
Wynonna...

27:46.012 --> 27:47.317
Maybe we should have
thought this one through.

27:51.234 --> 27:53.280
You have freed us.

27:53.323 --> 27:54.673
We are at your service.

27:58.198 --> 27:59.068
Okay.

27:59.112 --> 28:00.504
The Clantons are the dimwits

28:00.548 --> 28:01.810
of the Earp legend, right?

28:01.854 --> 28:03.812
Do you really think Sheriff
Creepy-Uncle-Vibe

28:03.856 --> 28:07.033
is going to get Crazy Witch
to just forgive and forget?

28:07.076 --> 28:08.991
These matters are best left
to adults,

28:09.035 --> 28:11.385
not youngins that've
recently been heartbroken

28:11.428 --> 28:12.908
by a certain young swain.

28:12.952 --> 28:14.605
: Swain?

28:14.649 --> 28:16.433
Doc, I think they killed Billy!

28:16.477 --> 28:17.913
Killed him? Their own kin?

28:17.957 --> 28:20.350
I went to go find him,
but all I saw was his psycho mom

28:20.394 --> 28:23.005
dripping blood on rocks,
and talking shit about Waverly.

28:23.049 --> 28:25.138
-Where is she?
-She ain't answering my calls.

28:27.009 --> 28:27.880
Now where are we going?

28:27.923 --> 28:29.185
You are going home.

28:29.229 --> 28:31.274
I am going to play consigliere.

28:31.318 --> 28:32.928
Is there a single Old
around here that can answer

28:32.972 --> 28:34.190
a simple question?

28:40.544 --> 28:42.851
You have broken
Medea's hold over us!

28:42.895 --> 28:44.505
We are eternally thankful!

28:45.811 --> 28:48.465
-Glad to be of help.
-Will you lead us?

28:48.509 --> 28:50.250
Will you show us
how to become cleansed?

28:50.293 --> 28:52.295
Hells no.

28:52.339 --> 28:55.516
Sister Fact: nobody here
is more tainted than this guy.

28:55.559 --> 28:57.083
Okay? Max taint all over this.

28:57.126 --> 28:59.128
And I'm fine with that.

28:59.172 --> 29:00.782
You guys, you're liberated. Go.

29:00.826 --> 29:03.132
Taint yourselves. Taint.

29:03.176 --> 29:04.786
We can't go.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.266
Not without the pain.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.748
Joanne? Is that you?

29:11.750 --> 29:12.663
And Alma?

29:13.577 --> 29:15.841
You know these wenches?

29:15.884 --> 29:18.191
Yeah. Some of them.
From a long time ago.

29:19.235 --> 29:20.367
Victims of Wyatt Earp.

29:22.978 --> 29:25.546
Huh. America's most
beloved executioner.

29:26.808 --> 29:28.767
He was such a dick.

29:30.246 --> 29:32.422
-How did he...?
-Collateral damage.

29:32.466 --> 29:34.598
Wrong place, wrong time.
Cursed once,

29:34.642 --> 29:37.776
but protected here, it seems.

29:37.819 --> 29:39.299
I'll get you out.

29:39.342 --> 29:40.691
All of you.

29:40.735 --> 29:42.302
Okay, there's gotta be
a way to set you free.

29:42.345 --> 29:45.609
Dude, we all don't have to be
like you to be free.

29:45.653 --> 29:48.830
This place
is an upgrade on a rock.

29:48.874 --> 29:49.700
Plus...

29:51.093 --> 29:52.791
They seem nice.

29:52.834 --> 29:53.879
Oh...

29:55.489 --> 29:57.012
Yes, they do.

29:58.274 --> 30:01.364
Alright, well if it makes
you happy, you do you.

30:01.408 --> 30:05.151
-And you, and you, and you.

30:05.194 --> 30:07.849
-Thanks for saving my ass.
-Well, be a shame not to.

30:10.199 --> 30:11.026
Oh, wait.

30:12.419 --> 30:13.681
I need to tell you something.

30:16.336 --> 30:18.077
Do you know why
I tried to steal Alice?

30:20.340 --> 30:21.558
Insurance against

30:21.602 --> 30:22.821
being Peacemakered to hell?

30:23.952 --> 30:25.780
And I...

30:25.824 --> 30:29.305
had a buyer for your baby.
Margo-Jean Clanton.

30:30.393 --> 30:31.264
Just...

30:33.135 --> 30:34.963
-I thought you should know.
-I gotta go.

30:35.007 --> 30:36.747
-Uh...

30:36.791 --> 30:37.661
We don't have to hug.

30:47.584 --> 30:48.716
-What's the tea?
-Uh...

30:51.937 --> 30:54.374
Oh, good.
A rock with a C on it.

30:54.417 --> 30:55.810
-Who's been marked?
-Waverly.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.986
She's on her way
to Magpie Ranch right now.

30:58.030 --> 30:58.813
With a shotgun.

31:00.032 --> 31:01.120
Then so are we.

31:09.476 --> 31:10.999
God, what a dump.

31:19.573 --> 31:21.662
OCD kicking in. Fight it, Waves.

31:23.925 --> 31:25.884
You're not my Amazon delivery.

31:28.582 --> 31:30.889
You frogged my girlfriend.

31:30.932 --> 31:33.021
I'll give you one chance
to fix it

31:33.065 --> 31:35.328
before I give you a buckshot
face lift.

31:35.371 --> 31:37.547
Sweetie, I can't fix it.

31:37.591 --> 31:39.549
That's not how a vendetta works.

31:39.593 --> 31:42.117
We're Capulets and Montagues.

31:42.161 --> 31:43.771
Hatfields and McCoys.

31:43.814 --> 31:45.425
Earps and Clantons.

31:45.468 --> 31:47.122
You should thank me.

31:47.166 --> 31:48.994
How do you think you knew
what door to take

31:49.037 --> 31:50.865
-out of the Garden?
-Gumption?

31:50.909 --> 31:54.956
Oh, that girl begged me, so...

31:55.000 --> 31:57.263
I showed John Henry the way.

31:57.306 --> 31:59.830
A blood feud can create
a powerful bond,

31:59.874 --> 32:01.702
even in between
spiritual planes.

32:01.745 --> 32:05.053
Oh, but she was feeble.

32:05.097 --> 32:06.925
"Oh, please!

32:06.968 --> 32:10.711
Help bring my angel back,
I'll do anything!"

32:10.754 --> 32:13.670
-What did she do?
-She made a deal.

32:13.714 --> 32:15.716
Doc comes back, with you in tow,

32:15.759 --> 32:18.588
and Ms. Haught
delivers him to me.

32:18.632 --> 32:21.156
Doc? What the hell
do you want with him?

32:21.200 --> 32:22.853
He took everything from us.

32:24.551 --> 32:25.813
At the O.K. Corral.

32:25.856 --> 32:29.338
But I will ruin him,
his name, his reputation.

32:29.382 --> 32:33.560
I will make him destroy
everything he loves.

32:33.603 --> 32:35.823
You basic bitch!

32:35.866 --> 32:38.913
Who gives a flippin' fudge
about the O.K. Corral anymore?!

32:38.957 --> 32:41.220
If you don't release Nicole,
she'll die!

32:41.263 --> 32:43.352
You're young.
You'll find someone else.

32:44.832 --> 32:46.051
I'd rather die.

32:46.094 --> 32:47.530
Then you'll be together.

32:50.229 --> 32:52.492
My ancestors will devour her.

32:52.535 --> 32:55.277
I have powers
you cannot comprehend!

32:55.321 --> 32:57.018
Same, same, bitch.

33:10.162 --> 33:11.380
What did I do?

33:15.384 --> 33:16.646
-Holy crap.
-Nicole?

33:16.690 --> 33:18.039
Blink once
if you can hear me.

33:20.215 --> 33:22.043
Why blink when I can talk?

33:22.087 --> 33:23.827
Oh!

33:23.871 --> 33:26.047
King of the Incantations!

33:26.091 --> 33:27.831
It was the Swamp Witch.

33:28.745 --> 33:30.921
-Jeremy, I'm so sorry.
-No, no, no, no.

33:30.965 --> 33:32.706
At least you're not barfing up
a pond full of frogs!

33:32.749 --> 33:34.055
You go, girl!

33:34.099 --> 33:35.448
Okay, we need to warm
her up slowly

33:35.491 --> 33:37.885
to prevent cardiac arrest.
Get some blankets.

33:37.928 --> 33:39.713
I am so glad
that you didn't croak.

33:39.756 --> 33:42.585
Yeah, but I frogged up... bad.

33:42.629 --> 33:45.849
Hey. It's just what happens
when we're not all together.

33:45.893 --> 33:46.633
Now...

33:48.069 --> 33:50.376
Come here. Oh!

33:50.419 --> 33:51.899
Oh!

34:07.697 --> 34:08.785
Wynonna.

34:10.091 --> 34:11.832
Waves?

34:11.875 --> 34:14.095
What happened, baby girl?

34:14.139 --> 34:16.097
I think I goofed real bad.

34:16.141 --> 34:17.707
Oh, I just heard from Jeremy.
Whatever you did,

34:17.751 --> 34:19.622
it saved Nicole
from frog-barf-o-rama!

34:20.493 --> 34:22.973
She's okay?
Oh, my God, it worked.

34:23.017 --> 34:25.237
-More good news.
-Peacemaker?! How? What?

34:26.934 --> 34:28.066
Long story.

34:28.109 --> 34:30.198
We have had ourselves a day.

34:33.332 --> 34:34.072
Hey!

34:35.290 --> 34:36.770
Don't you fucking move!

34:36.813 --> 34:38.076
You murdered my mother?!

34:38.989 --> 34:40.730
Why? Why?!

34:40.774 --> 34:43.255
I don't...
I don't know. I'm sorry.

34:46.301 --> 34:48.477
We had one chance
to end this, Earp.

34:48.521 --> 34:50.131
One goddamn chance.

34:50.175 --> 34:51.567
And now there's nothing
you can do

34:51.611 --> 34:53.395
to right the wrongs
of the O.K. Corral.

34:53.439 --> 34:55.441
Oh, my God, get over it!

34:55.484 --> 34:57.486
Your sicko witch mom
had it coming.

34:57.530 --> 34:59.967
You make your peace, Earp.

35:05.712 --> 35:07.322
Lower your weapons!

35:07.366 --> 35:08.497
Stand down!

35:08.541 --> 35:11.326
Go ahead and off
this son of a bitch, Doc.

35:11.370 --> 35:12.284
It's too late, Holliday.

35:14.024 --> 35:14.851
It's too late.

35:16.026 --> 35:18.725
It is never too late...

35:19.639 --> 35:21.075
to bury a grudge.

35:21.119 --> 35:21.989
Doc.

35:24.861 --> 35:26.428
I'm the Clanton heir now.

35:26.472 --> 35:28.735
Ex-squeeze me? That's kind of
an exclusive title.

35:28.778 --> 35:31.303
-I got no choice.
-The one thing...

35:31.346 --> 35:33.261
I have learned from Wynonna,

35:34.393 --> 35:36.743
is there is always...

35:36.786 --> 35:40.181
another way
to confront a problem.

35:41.182 --> 35:43.576
Whatever you may be up against,

35:43.619 --> 35:47.145
we can work this out
for the good of our kin.

35:49.059 --> 35:49.973
Together.

35:51.061 --> 35:52.498
Like we agreed.

35:52.541 --> 35:53.803
: You agreed?

35:54.848 --> 35:55.849
Billy's gone.

35:57.242 --> 35:58.286
Mam turned him.

36:00.723 --> 36:02.116
He didn't deserve it.

36:05.206 --> 36:08.166
A lot of innocents
have fallen victim to this feud.

36:12.996 --> 36:15.390
And your family has borne
more than its share

36:15.434 --> 36:16.609
of the burden.

36:24.660 --> 36:25.922
Let us get a drink.

37:00.827 --> 37:01.871
Thanks for distracting him.

37:12.708 --> 37:13.492
How is she?

37:15.494 --> 37:16.930
Not so hot, but...

37:18.061 --> 37:20.934
Alive and gargling
buckets of mouthwash.

37:24.329 --> 37:25.678
What you did, Wynonna...

37:26.983 --> 37:28.768
It was so wrong.

37:28.811 --> 37:31.901
-I believed in Holt.
-So did I.

37:31.945 --> 37:33.990
He was right, they never
would've stopped coming for us.

37:34.034 --> 37:35.601
There ain't a lick of honor

37:36.776 --> 37:38.778
in shooting a man in the back.

37:40.954 --> 37:41.868
My whole life...

37:42.869 --> 37:45.088
demons, townspeople, enemies,

37:45.132 --> 37:47.308
have tormented me
and my family, okay?

37:47.352 --> 37:49.441
I have had to kill
again and again,

37:49.484 --> 37:50.920
just to live another day, Doc.

37:50.964 --> 37:53.488
Do you think I give a shit
about honor?

37:53.532 --> 37:54.837
You have had to do
those things

37:54.881 --> 37:56.186
because of Wyatt Earp.

37:56.230 --> 37:57.840
Yeah.
You were his best friend!

37:57.884 --> 37:59.799
-I was.
-I think you're just pissed

37:59.842 --> 38:01.627
'cause he told the truth
about you in that video.

38:05.195 --> 38:06.980
You think that
was the truth about me?

38:12.246 --> 38:13.726
Maybe.

38:13.769 --> 38:15.467
Do you want me
just to say it, Henry?

38:18.687 --> 38:20.298
I like you because
you're not perfect.

38:23.388 --> 38:25.303
You're all busted up inside,
like me.

38:28.828 --> 38:31.352
I do not want to be, anymore.

38:33.398 --> 38:35.965
-Must be nice to have a choice.
-You have a choice, Wynonna!

38:38.403 --> 38:40.840
Did you ever wonder
why the Clantons

38:40.883 --> 38:41.928
never turned Revenant?

38:43.886 --> 38:46.280
It's because, yes, I had
to clean up Wyatt Earp's mess

38:46.324 --> 38:47.760
when he shot and he ran.

38:48.978 --> 38:50.284
At the O.K. Corral?

38:52.373 --> 38:53.548
I killed them.

38:55.985 --> 38:58.597
Doc. I never run.

39:00.076 --> 39:01.469
And I never will.

39:08.955 --> 39:11.523
I guess you and that gun
deserve each other.

39:19.531 --> 39:22.011
It was the Clantons
who wanted Alice.

39:26.320 --> 39:28.366
-Are you coming in?
-Yeah.

39:33.545 --> 39:35.242
I'm not much
in the mood, darlin'.

39:35.285 --> 39:38.114
Please. I'd like you both
to be here.

39:48.342 --> 39:50.866
To our first
and hopefully last exorcism!

39:50.910 --> 39:51.911
Yes!

39:53.869 --> 39:55.088
Oh, God. Hey!

39:55.131 --> 39:57.786
I told you!
Never leave the frog.

39:57.830 --> 40:01.486
Okay, I will add it
to my ever-growing
list of apologies.

40:01.529 --> 40:03.662
Fun new rule: from now on,

40:03.705 --> 40:05.446
nobody brings themselves
to the brink of death

40:05.490 --> 40:06.839
to fix a silly mistake.

40:06.882 --> 40:09.407
-Oh, I'll drink to that.
-Uh, no you won't.

40:11.234 --> 40:12.453
Okay...

40:12.497 --> 40:14.020
-No.

40:14.063 --> 40:16.805
-Nikki-Nikki-Nine-Door?
-Oh, God, no.

40:16.849 --> 40:19.112
I am recovering
from severe hypothermia.

40:19.155 --> 40:21.462
Yes, doctor's orders.
Okay, I'll take one for you.

40:23.769 --> 40:24.900
Are you two okay?

40:27.294 --> 40:28.164
We're the same.

40:30.863 --> 40:33.300
Ugh! Hey, Nic-averly!

40:33.343 --> 40:34.606
Are you two young,
sexy smoke shows

40:34.649 --> 40:36.129
-getting married, or what?
-Dude.

40:36.172 --> 40:37.478
-Jeremy!
-Ugh, what?!

40:37.522 --> 40:39.698
What have you been doing
all this time?

40:39.741 --> 40:42.483
Okay, I mean, I get it,
I get it, you know,

40:42.527 --> 40:44.180
in the Garden for 18 months,

40:44.224 --> 40:47.445
defeating a shape shifter,
protecting the homestead,

40:47.488 --> 40:49.534
a lot of lonely trapping, um...

40:51.013 --> 40:54.103
Yeah, never mind,
I'll shut up now.

40:56.018 --> 40:57.759
-Actually, I did--
-Well actually, I did have--

40:57.803 --> 40:59.587
: ...planned.

40:59.631 --> 41:00.588
You did?

41:01.937 --> 41:03.286
Me too.

Yes.

Yes.

41:56.078 --> 41:57.863
Yes, I'll marry you.

42:01.519 --> 42:02.998
Ah! Yes!

42:03.042 --> 42:04.739
-Yes!

42:04.783 --> 42:06.219
Girls!

42:06.262 --> 42:07.699
-Finally.
-Yay.

42:08.613 --> 42:09.527
: We win!

42:11.050 --> 42:13.661
I'm in the wedding party.
I hope.

42:13.705 --> 42:16.185
I don't wanna presume. Ahh!

I love you.

42:31.810 --> 42:32.985
I love you too.
