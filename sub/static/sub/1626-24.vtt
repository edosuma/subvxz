00:03.403 --> 00:06.672
Max, I have a surprise,
and it's right behind you.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.173
Before I turn around,
is it oprah?

00:08.175 --> 00:10.676
'cause I will die.

00:10.678 --> 00:13.479
It's a diploma
from pastry school.

00:13.481 --> 00:15.114
No, seriously,
what's the surprise?

00:15.116 --> 00:17.349
I'll even take gayle.

00:17.351 --> 00:20.819
You would've graduated
if the school hadn't closed,

00:20.821 --> 00:24.123
And oleg knows a guy
who fakes documents, so...

00:24.125 --> 00:25.524
You're a pastry school graduate,

00:25.526 --> 00:29.361
And I'm a real estate agent
and a french citizen.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.197
I'll be able to show houses
in France.

00:32.199 --> 00:34.133
And how are you
getting there?

00:34.135 --> 00:36.635
I'm also a licensed pilot.

00:36.637 --> 00:39.304
Look, I am not
a pastry school graduate.

00:39.306 --> 00:41.140
I'm not even
a high school graduate.

00:41.142 --> 00:44.009
The only thing I graduated from
was a scared straight program,

00:44.011 --> 00:46.412
Which is why
I'm not gay anymore.

00:47.580 --> 00:49.181
Max, you really
didn't graduate?

00:49.183 --> 00:50.582
I always thought
you were kidding

00:50.584 --> 00:52.151
About dropping out
of high school,

00:52.153 --> 00:54.720
Like when you say
that howard stern is your dad.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.021
'cause he is.

00:56.023 --> 00:57.790
Look at our eyes.

00:58.858 --> 00:59.858
And I did drop out.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.493
I was like, "later, suckas.

01:01.495 --> 01:04.263
I'll find a water fountain
somewhere else."

01:04.265 --> 01:05.831
Water fountains?
Gross.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.332
In private school,

01:07.334 --> 01:09.168
We never bent down
to put our mouths on something

01:09.170 --> 01:11.403
Unless it had a yacht.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.908
I didn't need a piece of paper
from high school,

01:15.910 --> 01:17.943
And I don't need
this fake piece of paper,

01:17.945 --> 01:19.711
Because I don't fake things.

01:19.713 --> 01:21.246
Except orgasms with guys

01:21.248 --> 01:22.681
Who don't know
how to yank hair good.

You slimeball.

[laughs]

01:43.370 --> 01:45.070
Oh, good.

01:45.072 --> 01:47.206
When you weren't here
when I woke up, I got worried.

01:47.208 --> 01:49.241
So worried you decided
to eat cookies

01:49.243 --> 01:51.310
And watch <i>mama's family?</i>

01:52.579 --> 01:54.480
We all grieve
in our own way.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.348
Guess I should cancel
the strippers.

01:57.917 --> 02:01.386
So I found out
something interesting today

02:01.388 --> 02:02.654
That has to do with you.

02:02.656 --> 02:06.325
Aw, crap, you found out
what happened in orlando?

02:06.327 --> 02:08.961
Why?
What happened in orlando?

02:08.963 --> 02:12.097
Don't tell me you slept
with mickey mouse.

02:12.099 --> 02:13.966
Well, I slept with someone

02:13.968 --> 02:18.003
With suspenders
and four fingers.

02:18.005 --> 02:20.973
I'm assuming
it was mickey.

02:20.975 --> 02:23.342
Either way,
it was heaven.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.811
Well, I found out

02:25.813 --> 02:27.980
That you're not the badass
you claim to be.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.848
I talked to your old
high school principal,

02:29.850 --> 02:31.650
And he said the only reason
you didn't graduate

02:31.652 --> 02:34.319
Is 'cause you failed to show up
for one history final.

02:34.321 --> 02:37.990
My high school's
still standing?

02:37.992 --> 02:40.392
Guess I didn't flick
that cigarette far enough.

02:42.262 --> 02:45.030
I cannot believe you'd invade
my privacy like that.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.698
Invade your privacy?

02:46.700 --> 02:49.201
You shave your junk
with the door open.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.639
So?

02:53.641 --> 02:56.575
To the apartment.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.479
Well, maybe you'll change
your mind

03:00.481 --> 03:02.214
When you find out
that the principal--

03:02.216 --> 03:04.449
Your old history teacher,
mr. Huck--

03:04.451 --> 03:06.285
Said you can come back
and take the test this Friday,

03:06.287 --> 03:08.320
And if you pass,
you'll get your diploma.

03:09.623 --> 03:10.622

I will murder your face.

03:13.460 --> 03:14.560
Max, please don't kill me.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.361
I can live here,
but I can't die here.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.432
Hey, girls.

03:23.803 --> 03:26.805
I got google glasses.

03:26.807 --> 03:29.408
See, right now,
I'm looking at you

03:29.410 --> 03:33.478
And ordering tapioca
on amazon.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.149
Now is not a great time,
sophie.

03:37.151 --> 03:39.384
Max is upset with me
because I'm trying to help her

03:39.386 --> 03:41.386
Graduate from high school.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.355
Aw, you're sure
she's just not upset with you

03:43.357 --> 03:44.990
'cause of the way you chew?

03:44.992 --> 03:49.161
I'm sorry I have to chew,
everyone.

03:49.163 --> 03:51.363
I found out max can go
take one history test

03:51.365 --> 03:53.565
In her hometown,
and then she'll get her diploma.

03:54.534 --> 03:55.500
Max, you know
I've never been

03:55.502 --> 03:57.736
A big fan of hers...

03:59.439 --> 04:01.907
But I like the idea
of you getting that degree.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.709
I mean,
I'll never live down

04:03.711 --> 04:06.445
Not graduating
from school for the deaf.

04:08.848 --> 04:10.349
You're not deaf, sophie.

04:10.351 --> 04:13.118
I know.
It was really hard.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.256
Well, I don't care
who she called,

04:17.258 --> 04:18.624
'cause I'm not gonna do it.

04:18.626 --> 04:21.126
And if mr. Huck thinks
I would ever step foot

04:21.128 --> 04:23.695
Back in his
mr. Know-it-all university,

04:23.697 --> 04:25.464
I have two words for him.

04:25.466 --> 04:26.832
"huck u."

04:29.135 --> 04:31.303
That's what mr. Huck
said you'd say.

04:31.305 --> 04:33.272
He also said
that senior year,

04:33.274 --> 04:36.375
You sold
"huck u" t-shirts

04:36.377 --> 04:39.278
And that you have no ambition
and no follow-through.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.880
That's when I knew
he was really your teacher.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.149
No ambition?

04:44.151 --> 04:45.550
I made enough
off those shirts

04:45.552 --> 04:47.786
To do nothing
for, like, a month.

04:50.089 --> 04:52.324
Look, I got two bus tickets
to rhode island.

04:52.326 --> 04:54.393
I didn't even know you could
buy bus tickets ahead of time.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.328
I thought you just showed up,
and if you looked like

04:56.330 --> 04:58.463
You made enough mistakes
in life, they let you on.

05:00.566 --> 05:01.967

come on, max.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.268
I haven't waited this long

05:03.270 --> 05:04.970
To hear someone say yes

05:04.972 --> 05:08.040
Since I was
at school for the deaf.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.410
Fine.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.078
Fine, I'll go.

05:13.080 --> 05:16.848
But only because mr. Huck
thinks I won't.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.451
Aw, okay, well, I'm gonna
let you two start studying.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.119
And in full disclosure,

05:21.121 --> 05:24.356
I watched some porno
during this conversation.

05:24.358 --> 05:25.724
See ya later.

05:30.430 --> 05:31.863
Hey, max.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.032

the good news

05:34.034 --> 05:36.702
About you going back to take
that american history test.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.036
Good for you.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.871
Yeah, I started studying
last night,

05:39.873 --> 05:41.807
And on behalf
of all white people,

05:41.809 --> 05:44.609
I would like to apologize
for everything ever.

05:46.879 --> 05:50.015
Well, apology accepted
for everything ever

05:50.017 --> 05:53.185
Except for slavery
and the gap.

05:55.822 --> 05:58.623
Here, max, I brought you
the history book

05:58.625 --> 06:00.525
Which I'm studying from
for my citizenship test.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.594
Aren't babies
automatically citizens?

06:05.164 --> 06:08.533
I don't know why
I root for you.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.136
Here, your country
has a very rich past,

06:11.138 --> 06:14.306
Unlike korea, which had its past
stolen by the japanese.

06:15.742 --> 06:19.811
Han, we are not talking
about european history.

06:19.813 --> 06:22.647
We are talking
about american history.

06:22.649 --> 06:25.484
Oof, you're going to be
working here forever.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.655
Good luck, lady.

06:32.859 --> 06:34.659
Okay, max,
I've come up with a way

06:34.661 --> 06:36.862
For you to work and study
at the same time,

06:36.864 --> 06:40.399
Like when you shop and steal
at the same time.

06:40.401 --> 06:42.567
I know, when they show it
to me on those security cameras,

06:42.569 --> 06:45.036
I'm always impressed.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.272
I mean, I really don't know
anyone else who's doing it.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.575

06:53.781 --> 06:56.681
Why do I have to have
all this burrito drama?

06:56.683 --> 06:59.184

I have to quiz you

06:59.186 --> 07:01.720

to the window, so...

07:01.722 --> 07:04.456
Who was the sexually virile
male pop singer

07:04.458 --> 07:07.793
Responsible for the hit song
jessie's girl?

07:09.695 --> 07:10.962

07:10.964 --> 07:14.466

smarty.

07:14.468 --> 07:15.934
Oleg, no.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.269
You have to ask questions

07:17.271 --> 07:18.770
From the flash cards
I provided.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.472
They're color-coordinated
by century

07:20.474 --> 07:23.542
And subdivided by president.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.076
Don't look at me
like that, max.

07:25.078 --> 07:27.479
I'm a fun person.
I taught myself the dougie.

07:31.217 --> 07:33.418
Okay, here goes.

07:33.420 --> 07:36.755
Which amendment to
the United States constitution

07:36.757 --> 07:39.558
Guarantees
a woman's right to...

07:39.560 --> 07:41.226
Vote?

07:45.231 --> 07:47.632
Wait, women can vote?

07:49.335 --> 07:53.672
So when you say
women can vote,

07:53.674 --> 07:57.375
You mean, like,
besides for <i>american idol?</i>

07:59.645 --> 08:01.913
Max, you think you're not smart,
but you are.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.682
You just need to come up
with little tricks

08:03.684 --> 08:05.083
To help jog your memory.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.785
My memory doesn't jog.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.920
I've smoked so much pot,
it's in one of those hospitals

08:08.922 --> 08:10.989
Learning to walk again.

08:15.027 --> 08:16.862
What was
the great compromise?

08:16.864 --> 08:19.631
You mean besides
you moving in with me?

08:19.633 --> 08:21.600
It created the two houses
of congress.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.768
Hooty-hoo!

08:23.770 --> 08:25.804
Next question:
What was the movement

08:25.806 --> 08:28.306
Against the sale or drinking
of alcohol called?

08:28.308 --> 08:29.841
The bowel movement?

08:29.843 --> 08:32.644
No, the temperance movement.

08:32.646 --> 08:34.212
And don't mention
the bathroom.

08:34.214 --> 08:36.281
I've had to pee
since we passed that last town

08:36.283 --> 08:38.216
That used to make something.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.684
Just go to the bathroom.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.686
What are you so afraid of?

08:41.688 --> 08:44.322
The bathroom.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.657
I will use
a public bathroom.

08:45.659 --> 08:46.825
I will use a public bus.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.360
But I will not use
the public bathroom

08:48.362 --> 08:49.694
On a public bus.

08:49.696 --> 08:50.896
Next card.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.697
No, give me a twizzler.
I know enough.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.332
No candy.
Study harder.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.134
You're looking
at a solid "d."

08:56.136 --> 08:59.137
Well, my grades
should match my boobs.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.805
Next question.
Okay.

09:00.807 --> 09:03.375
In what city
was the constitution written?

09:03.377 --> 09:05.143
No idea.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.811
Philadelphia?

09:06.813 --> 09:08.480
Oh, damn it,
I almost said that.

09:08.482 --> 09:09.814
It's right there.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.750
Philadelphia makes
cheesesteaks.

09:11.752 --> 09:14.686
The constitution
is cheesy.

09:14.688 --> 09:16.555
Why do I doubt myself?

09:16.557 --> 09:18.223
How much further?

09:18.225 --> 09:20.392
I thought rhode island
was supposed to be a tiny state.

09:20.394 --> 09:21.693
When are we stopping?

09:21.695 --> 09:22.928
Well, we have
to pass cranston,

09:22.930 --> 09:25.163
Providence,
and then our stop is hope.

09:25.165 --> 09:29.234
Wait, max, you were born
in a town called "hope"?

09:29.236 --> 09:30.769
Well, just outside hope.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.170
And success and money.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.838
[groans]
well, there's no hope for me.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.173
I have to pee so badly.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.042
I'm going in.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.376
Leave the twizzlers.

09:38.378 --> 09:39.744
Here, study.

09:40.947 --> 09:42.247
Oh, my god.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.582
You know the toilet

09:43.584 --> 09:45.684
Isn't just there
as a suggestion.

09:50.456 --> 09:51.856
[yelps]

10:00.533 --> 10:02.968
Wow, north east high.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.803
Never thought
I'd be here again.

10:04.805 --> 10:07.772
This sure brings back
no memories.

10:09.308 --> 10:10.976
It's cute.

10:10.978 --> 10:14.546
You know, in an underfunded
public school kind of way.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.283
Wait, are you in high school?

10:18.285 --> 10:21.219
Oh, my god, I'm 100.

10:21.221 --> 10:22.988
Oh, there it is, 2-c.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.823
Hold on.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.324
Why are you covering
those up?

10:26.326 --> 10:29.327
They're the only reason
I passed chemistry.

10:31.731 --> 10:34.065
Max black.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.801
Mr. Huck.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.303
I'm surprised.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.771
That I showed up?

10:39.773 --> 10:42.240
No, that you're alive.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.909
You and me both,
sister.

10:44.911 --> 10:46.578
[chuckles]

10:46.580 --> 10:48.179
And you must be caroline.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.447
Oh, you look just
like the girls

10:49.449 --> 10:51.650
Max used to give wedgies to
in the cafeteria.

10:53.085 --> 10:55.286
Still does.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.455
Oh, ladies,
this is hector.

10:57.457 --> 10:58.857
Hector will be
joining us today,

10:58.859 --> 11:01.292
As he was not in attendance
during exam day.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.428
Ay, yo, mr. Huck,
that's 'cause my sister

11:03.430 --> 11:05.163
Didn't wake me up
'cause she's a bitch.

11:07.433 --> 11:08.833
Very good.

11:11.303 --> 11:12.537
Ay, yo.

11:12.539 --> 11:14.439
This place is filled
with tiny tables, yo.

11:17.209 --> 11:18.476
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:18.478 --> 11:19.778
It's teachers
and delinquents only

11:19.780 --> 11:21.112
Beyond this point.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.014
You can wait out there.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.616
Are you nervous?
A little.

11:24.618 --> 11:26.184
I forgot I have a joint
in my purse,

11:26.186 --> 11:28.053
And I don't want
to get expelled.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.221
Max, you can do this.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.623
I think
you think you can't,

11:31.625 --> 11:33.692
But I know that you can.

11:33.694 --> 11:35.493
Look at me.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.562
You are smart.

11:37.564 --> 11:38.563
What are you?

11:38.565 --> 11:40.065
Smart.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.766
See, you already got
one question right.

11:43.636 --> 11:45.336
Okay, kids,

11:45.338 --> 11:47.138
Put on your thinking hats.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.374
Ay, yo, I thought
we couldn't wear hats

11:49.376 --> 11:51.543
In the classroom.

11:53.512 --> 11:55.213
I'm going to ignore that,
because if I don't,

11:55.215 --> 11:57.315
I will weep.

11:57.317 --> 12:00.318

warned which two men

12:00.320 --> 12:03.555

and a quart of beer.

and if you have too much,

12:10.931 --> 12:13.164

a hancock.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.233

12:19.004 --> 12:20.538

when I waited for the results

12:20.540 --> 12:23.508
Of a hep c test.

12:23.510 --> 12:26.411
Then again, I didn't study
for that one at all.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.781
Ay, yo,
I think I nailed it.

12:29.783 --> 12:32.617
You failed, hector.

12:32.619 --> 12:33.785
For real?

12:33.787 --> 12:35.587
For really real.

12:35.589 --> 12:36.621
You even got the answer wrong

12:36.623 --> 12:39.124
That max so graciously said
out loud.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.560
Aw, that's cool, mr. Huck.

12:42.562 --> 12:43.561
Next time, right?

12:43.563 --> 12:44.429
[both chuckle]

12:44.431 --> 12:45.630
Sure.

12:47.800 --> 12:52.137
Max, I'm sorry
to tell you that...

12:53.405 --> 12:55.273
I was wrong to doubt you.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.374
You got a "b."

12:56.376 --> 12:57.609
You passed.

12:57.611 --> 13:00.044
You lying son of a bitch.

13:00.046 --> 13:01.112
[laughs]

13:02.047 --> 13:03.314
It's true, max.

13:03.316 --> 13:04.816
In fact,
I went over it three times

13:04.818 --> 13:06.684
To make sure I wasn't insane.

13:08.254 --> 13:09.954
Whatever that friend of yours
there did to help you,

13:09.956 --> 13:11.923
It really worked.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.558
I'm sorry,

13:13.560 --> 13:14.959
But I can't stand
out there any longer.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.234
Now my grade matches

13:24.470 --> 13:25.770
I'm getting that stupid diploma

13:25.772 --> 13:28.006
I said I didn't care about.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.278
You can do more
than get that diploma, max.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.313
Graduation is tomorrow,
and if you stay overnight,

13:35.315 --> 13:36.915
You can walk with the class
in the morning.

13:36.917 --> 13:40.618
Uh, yes.

13:40.620 --> 13:43.288
You want to go
to graduation?

13:43.290 --> 13:45.590
That's so me of you.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.926
Well, I busted my "a"
to get that "b,"

13:47.928 --> 13:49.594
And I want to get
the whole package.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.329
That's great.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.997
Well, we'll see you tomorrow
at 10:00 a.M.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.766
And, hector, we'll see you
in front of the ampm

13:54.768 --> 13:56.367
Asking strangers
to buy you beer?

14:04.610 --> 14:06.978
I call the bed.
You can have the table.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.547
Max, that bed is so tiny,
we're gonna have to spoon.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.516
The only spoon
that's ever been in this room

14:11.518 --> 14:13.852
Was hovering over a flame.

14:13.854 --> 14:16.054
Well, it's cute.

14:16.056 --> 14:19.324
I'm not vaccinated
for anything in here, but...

14:19.326 --> 14:21.192
It's cute.

14:24.797 --> 14:27.866
And safe.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.200
Yeah, they have cable,

14:29.202 --> 14:30.802
And you can rent rooms
by the hour,

14:30.804 --> 14:32.704
So I used to come here
to watch <i>sex and the city</i>

14:32.706 --> 14:35.340
With a prostitute
named tiny marge.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.041
She'd bring me banana bread
and hang out.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.977
It was fun.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.311
Oh, great.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.347
There's no coffeemaker.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.749
[sighs]

14:44.751 --> 14:48.219
Never mind,
found it.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.722
Your mom wasn't worried
when you'd come down here?

14:50.724 --> 14:52.390
No.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.591
She was a little jealous
that I was hanging out

14:53.593 --> 14:55.326
With tiny marge without her,
but...

14:55.328 --> 14:59.264
The only thing my mom
ever worried about was herself.

14:59.266 --> 15:02.200
She's selfish.

15:02.202 --> 15:06.070
She missed my birth
'cause she "had a thing."

15:06.072 --> 15:08.373
Come on,
she can't be that bad.

15:08.375 --> 15:11.409
Turns out, you're not that big
of a high school dropout,

15:11.411 --> 15:13.211
And she's probably not
that big of a monster.

15:13.213 --> 15:15.546
I mean, she raised you alone,
and you didn't die.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.415
I did actually, twice.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.051
But in fairness to her,
she wasn't there either time.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.887
Max, why don't you invite her
to your graduation?

15:22.889 --> 15:24.555
And don't say
you don't have her number.

15:24.557 --> 15:28.393
I know it's in your phone
under "lady I came out of."

15:28.395 --> 15:31.696
I also know I'm in your phone
as "fart monster."

15:31.698 --> 15:34.465
That's because I know, like,
three carolines.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.466
No, you don't.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.768
Busted.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.102
Here, I'll dial,

15:38.104 --> 15:39.570
You just leave the message.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.205
Here.
No!

15:41.207 --> 15:42.907

Okay, max, maybe don't say
anything else,

16:46.773 --> 16:48.940
Or they'll take
your diploma back.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.465
You were so close
to getting your diploma.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.533
Why didn't you take
that test?

17:15.535 --> 17:17.535
I was going to, but my mother

17:17.537 --> 17:19.704
Kept me out of school that day
to go to the mall.

17:19.706 --> 17:22.073

17:22.075 --> 17:23.541

didn't come here today.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.552

Maybe she'll come.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.753

17:35.755 --> 17:37.088
I mean, my dad was late

what happened to my mom.

passed out on top of her.

(sophie)
whoo-whoo!

19:54.027 --> 19:56.060
That's my downstairs neighbor!

19:56.062 --> 19:59.864
Whoo-whoo!
Yeah!

20:09.641 --> 20:11.509
So what,
you called them all?

20:11.511 --> 20:14.178
Yeah, you know,
just in case.

20:14.180 --> 20:15.713
Max, you were right,
and I was wrong.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.582
Your mother's really
as bad as you said.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.817
Mm, oh, it's not that bad.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.052
What do you mean?

20:21.054 --> 20:22.687
She took you to the mall
on finals day.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.522
Yeah, but it was
the greatest day

20:24.524 --> 20:25.590
We ever had.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.258
We got ice cream,

20:27.260 --> 20:29.594
We ate it in the massage chairs
at brookstone,

20:29.596 --> 20:30.995
And then a kid
fell in the fountain,

20:30.997 --> 20:32.997
And we died laughing.

20:32.999 --> 20:35.066
Well, I guess you can graduate
high school any day,

20:35.068 --> 20:38.669
But you can only watch a kid
almost drown in a fountain once.

20:38.671 --> 20:42.073
It is okay that she wasn't there
today, because you were.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.708
And none of this
would have been possible

20:43.710 --> 20:45.343
If you hadn't pushed me.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.511
And that kid wouldn't have
almost drowned

20:47.513 --> 20:48.646
If I hadn't pushed him.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.549
Little different.

20:51.551 --> 20:54.552
Bottom line,
you had faith in me

20:54.554 --> 20:57.288
Like thomas jefferson
had faith in lewis and clark.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.791
Oh, no.

21:00.793 --> 21:03.594
Now you're both nerds!
