-My wine is distinct.

00:13.831 --> 00:16.732
The extortionist poisoned
sean and sean's vines
with glyphosate.

00:16.834 --> 00:18.400
An extortionist?

00:18.502 --> 00:20.119
Someone is threatening
our family?

00:20.204 --> 00:21.754
[man] otis haney,
you're under arrest.

00:21.872 --> 00:24.623
-You blocked me
from getting my job back.
-We can work through this.

00:24.709 --> 00:26.125
I'm not making any promises.

00:26.210 --> 00:28.711
Glyphosate?
Why does bridgette have this?

01:20.231 --> 01:21.230
Was working all night.

01:21.816 --> 01:22.898
Are you okay?

01:22.983 --> 01:24.583
[grace]<i> get down here.</i>
<i> We've got a problem.</i>

01:25.653 --> 01:27.102
Okay, all right.
I'm on my way.

01:32.993 --> 01:34.109
[August]<i> are you sure</i>
<i> they're ruined?</i>

01:34.945 --> 01:36.028
What happened?

01:36.113 --> 01:39.948
Christian, he left these
babies to suffer in this heat.

01:41.418 --> 01:44.203
I mean, I'm just seeing
a little uv ray damage.

01:44.288 --> 01:46.421
Can't you work your magic,
grace, please?

01:46.507 --> 01:47.756
I can't.

01:47.842 --> 01:50.759
Harvested grapes must be
immediately prepped
for fermentation

01:50.845 --> 01:53.378
or refrigerated
and what you have here,

01:53.464 --> 01:55.180
are literally sour grapes.

01:55.299 --> 01:57.633
Okay, how much...
How much of the crop
have we lost?

01:58.769 --> 01:59.718
15%.

01:59.804 --> 02:01.737
That's half-a-million
in revenue!

02:01.822 --> 02:03.856
If my dad were alive,
he would kill me!

02:03.941 --> 02:05.941
August, your daddy
was no dummy.

02:06.026 --> 02:08.911
And christian mucking up
our dessert wine production

02:08.996 --> 02:11.280
-could happen next
and then I am out.
-No, no, no.

02:11.365 --> 02:12.781
That won't happen.

02:12.867 --> 02:15.033
At least I hope
that won't happen.

02:15.119 --> 02:17.786
Listen, you need to make
a boss move.

02:18.506 --> 02:19.872
Bring bridgette back.

02:19.957 --> 02:22.124
She's the key to your success.

02:52.907 --> 02:56.241
[upbeat song playing]

03:09.840 --> 03:11.506
hmm, yeah.

03:12.009 --> 03:13.642
I still feel him too.

03:13.727 --> 03:17.396
Listen, mom,
thanks for going to that
convention in new york for me.

03:17.514 --> 03:19.898
I really want a label for
our dessert wine that just...

03:20.017 --> 03:21.900
Grabs your right from
the shelf, you know?

03:22.019 --> 03:23.819
You can always count on me.

03:23.904 --> 03:27.072
Great. Because I have
something else I wanna
talk to you about.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.359
You and kelvin are looking
at turquoise boxes?

03:30.444 --> 03:31.994
-Mom...
-Babies in the rising.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.496
-[chuckles] okay, listen,
I'm gonna ignore that.
-Okay.

03:34.582 --> 03:37.032
-We're good though.
We're really good.
-Yeah.

03:37.117 --> 03:38.283
But, this is about bridgette.

03:39.286 --> 03:41.787
The entire company is
riding on this new wine.

03:41.872 --> 03:43.338
If we're gonna put out
this dessert wine,

03:43.424 --> 03:46.008
I could really use
her on the vines.

03:46.093 --> 03:47.209
She'd mentor christian.

03:47.878 --> 03:50.045
I have been thinking about
her a lot, lately.

03:52.049 --> 03:55.133
About how bridgette is
in her element
when she's in the vines.

03:55.219 --> 03:57.636
She's diligent and
knowledgeable about
the grapes.

03:58.138 --> 03:59.638
A real connoisseur.

03:59.723 --> 04:01.139
She's our secret weapon, mom.

04:02.393 --> 04:03.392
We need bridgette back.

04:03.477 --> 04:05.611
-And...Listen,
I know things are...
-Stop.

04:05.729 --> 04:06.812
I know what to do.

04:06.897 --> 04:08.030
-Mm?
-Come on.

04:08.115 --> 04:09.031
Okay.

♪<i> I already got</i>

04:10.818 --> 04:12.784

-Mm...
-You know my birthday
is on July.

04:14.571 --> 04:17.823
-Yes, I know.
-Although, the blindfold
is kinda kinky.

04:17.908 --> 04:20.242
-And I like it.
-[chuckles] hold still.

-Okay.

-Yes, ready.

04:41.598 --> 04:44.182
I wanted to do something
nice for my man.

04:44.268 --> 04:47.436
A gift.
Things were rocky there
between us for a minute.

04:48.322 --> 04:50.188
And the stress of
the family vote.

04:50.274 --> 04:52.357
Otis' betrayal.

04:52.443 --> 04:54.276
It can take a toll
on a marriage.

04:54.945 --> 04:58.780
[chuckles] I'm glad
we've got a chance to reset.

04:58.866 --> 05:01.166
You've gotta keep it
hot and popping, daddy.

05:01.285 --> 05:05.003
Past seven nights of sex
were definitely
all that and then some.

05:07.291 --> 05:08.457
let's start here.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.012
No, no, no, no.

05:14.631 --> 05:16.098
Something's up.

05:16.183 --> 05:17.516
I got a mother and a sister.

05:17.634 --> 05:18.934
I know when I'm
getting played.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.802
-What's going on?
-Fine, you've got me.

05:22.022 --> 05:25.023
Okay, so, I went to see
my girly doc and

05:25.142 --> 05:28.527
she thinks we should
pop over and see dr. Roo
at the fertility clinic.

05:28.645 --> 05:29.945
The what?

05:30.030 --> 05:32.280
We've been having
problems, dana.

05:32.366 --> 05:34.533
So, maybe we just need
an assist.

05:34.651 --> 05:37.035
What is this baseball?
I'm not whacking off in a cup.

05:37.154 --> 05:40.405
When you were mad at me,
you wacked off everyday,
I heard you.

05:40.491 --> 05:43.075
[stammers] this is just
like that, except,

05:43.160 --> 05:44.910
you put it in
a tiny test tube,

05:44.995 --> 05:48.380
the baby gods work their magic
and I could be
pregnant for summer.

05:48.499 --> 05:51.333
Me, in a cute little bikini,

05:51.418 --> 05:53.051
my tummy popped out.

05:53.170 --> 05:55.420
Oh dana, I dream of it.

05:57.508 --> 05:59.341
Come on baby. [chuckles]

05:59.426 --> 06:01.059
don't you want another dana?

06:01.595 --> 06:03.145

-Yeah. [chuckles]

I'm still your mother.

do this?

ever going to heal.

It's too much.

06:27.421 --> 06:29.421
We need to find you
a new place now.

-[bridgette]<i> no, no, no.</i>

I wasn't kidding when I said
I was gonna get your job back.

06:42.386 --> 06:44.553
I talked to mom,
and we think...

06:44.638 --> 06:48.106
Christian is wonderful.
But he needs guidance.

06:48.225 --> 06:51.276
-Are you kidding me?
-I know we have made
a lot of mistakes,

06:51.395 --> 06:52.644
but we need you.

06:52.729 --> 06:54.279
Okay, I get it.

06:54.398 --> 06:56.148
You're worried your
dessert wine will be a bust

06:56.233 --> 06:58.567
and this is just some
manipulative game.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.986
After all the shade
you've thrown me,
do you really expect me

07:01.071 --> 07:02.454
to believe,
you're just suddenly

07:02.573 --> 07:04.539
okay with me
being back at the vineyard?

07:04.625 --> 07:07.209
Yes, because I am

07:07.294 --> 07:10.378
-look bridgette,
it's been a journey.
-Mm-hm.

07:10.464 --> 07:13.748
One involving prayer
with reverend banks,

07:13.834 --> 07:15.967
-and a lot merlot... Yeah...
-There she is.

07:16.086 --> 07:18.336
-Mmm-hmm.
-One you helped create.

07:18.422 --> 07:21.890
I was wrong for punishing you
for your mom's transgressions.

07:21.975 --> 07:25.510
If you come back,
we will give you
whatever you want.

07:25.596 --> 07:29.464
And you'll be back not just as
an employee but as
part of the family, of course.

07:29.933 --> 07:33.435
-I don't believe this.
-Let me prove it to you.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.403
I'm going to new york
for the wine convention.

07:35.489 --> 07:37.939
August was going to go.
But she needs to be here.

07:38.942 --> 07:39.991
Let's go together

07:40.110 --> 07:42.077
but don't I need to get
started on the vines?

07:42.162 --> 07:44.446
Grace says, nothing can be
done to the grapes in the next
couple of days, so,

07:44.531 --> 07:47.249
we will go back at
the dessert wine, full force,
when you come back.

07:47.334 --> 07:48.700
-Mm-hm.
-Come on.

07:49.453 --> 07:51.036
You call sean and sean

07:51.121 --> 07:52.454
and tell them that you're out.

07:53.540 --> 07:54.956
Come on.

07:56.793 --> 07:58.877
Oh come on, don't make me beg.

07:58.962 --> 08:01.046
-I kinda like when you beg.
-[all chuckle]

08:01.131 --> 08:02.430
-come on.
-[screams playfully]

08:02.516 --> 08:04.132
-yay...She's back!
-Yes.

08:04.218 --> 08:06.518
-Come on.
-[both chuckling]

08:06.637 --> 08:08.687
-she's back. [chuckles]
-yay!

08:09.139 --> 08:11.356
[both chuckling]

08:17.147 --> 08:19.197
well, don't you
look beautiful.

08:19.316 --> 08:21.149
Looking all 40 and fabulous.

08:21.235 --> 08:23.869
-The answer is no.
-Please, vanessa.

08:23.987 --> 08:27.205
Bridgette's couch is a break.
I heard you on
a forgiveness tour.

08:27.324 --> 08:29.824
Rumor has it, you're taking
bridgette to the big apple.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.042
Time heals some wounds.

08:31.161 --> 08:33.128
Others scar like keloids.

08:33.213 --> 08:36.748
-Shouldn't you be
working on something.
-I am. Jason collins.

08:36.833 --> 08:39.134
-The wine distributor?
-He's playing hard to get.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.719
And I need to close him soon.

08:40.837 --> 08:43.672
Well, maybe he's just
frightened that you'll open
that trap of yours

08:43.757 --> 08:45.006
and spill all his secrets.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.725
You hold a grudge
like a republican.

08:46.843 --> 08:48.894
Save your time on mr. Collins.

08:49.012 --> 08:50.478
We've never been able
to crack that nut.

08:50.564 --> 08:54.015
Our previous vp of sales
was stanford,
business school pedigreed

08:54.101 --> 08:55.567
and he failed.

08:55.686 --> 08:57.435
Before this,
you were peddling wigs.

08:57.521 --> 09:00.155
[scoffs] making six-figure
stacks, a year.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.857
You are out of you league,
sister girl.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.743
But if you were to nail him
I'd reconsider

09:04.861 --> 09:06.695
your living situation, but...
[chuckles]

09:06.780 --> 09:10.248
you're not in oakland anymore.
Kisses.

09:10.367 --> 09:12.617
[chuckles] safe flight...

09:12.703 --> 09:14.536
-On your broom.
-[door slams]

09:18.208 --> 09:20.041
you can't keep
sitting on this, 'cause...

09:20.127 --> 09:22.377
Real talk, it is starting to
affect your bed game.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.796
Yo, I'm stressed.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.433
I mean, how do I tell August,

09:28.552 --> 09:32.304
"I think that my half-sister
maybe trying to pull a
<i>godfather</i> move on our family."

09:32.940 --> 09:34.105
I'll go in with you.

09:34.891 --> 09:36.775
-I'll hold your hand.
-Nah,

09:36.893 --> 09:39.144
I ain't ready for you
meeting her and all that yet.

09:39.229 --> 09:41.279
Catch an uber sheila
and I'll hit you up later.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.064
So it's like that.

09:44.318 --> 09:45.700
You know what?
Loose my number.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.652
Yeah, 'cause I'm not about
to be played by a brother

09:47.738 --> 09:50.071
who does nothing more
than live-off
of his family's coin.

09:50.157 --> 09:51.656
-You're being
serious right now.
-Deuces.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.125
[grace] mm-hm.

09:54.244 --> 09:56.044
And as soon a bridgette
gets back,

09:56.129 --> 09:58.747
we can finally get this
fermentation game rolling

09:58.832 --> 10:01.833
oh, that's great.
'cause you know she's gonna
work her magic.

10:01.918 --> 10:04.085
Wait, are you getting
bridgette her job back

10:04.171 --> 10:05.837
yeah, I thought mom told you.

10:05.922 --> 10:07.389
She put down her weapons
and end of the war.

10:07.474 --> 10:08.807
They're headed to
new york together.

10:09.926 --> 10:12.177
-I'm gonna check on the yeast.
Hm.
-Yeah.

10:13.597 --> 10:16.097
Yo, we can't bring her back.

10:16.183 --> 10:18.850
Why? What is that

10:18.935 --> 10:20.268
evidence that might
clear otis.

10:21.104 --> 10:22.821
It's glyphosate,

10:22.939 --> 10:25.690
the same poison that the cops
said was used in the attack
on sean and sean's vineyard

10:26.610 --> 10:27.942
I don't understand.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.245
I found it in bridgette's
work bag last night.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.113
She had a big bag
of this stuff.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.581
I just brought you a sample.

10:33.667 --> 10:36.034
I think our new sister
could be the extortionist.

10:41.725 --> 10:44.225
So, you found this stuff
in bridgette's bag

10:44.311 --> 10:45.977
after sneaking her on
to the vineyard

10:46.096 --> 10:47.462
no, otis did it.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.147
-Plain and simple.
-Then how do you explain

10:49.266 --> 10:51.149
the drill,
that I also found in her bag?

10:51.268 --> 10:54.602
That's what someone would use
to inject poison
into the vines.

10:54.688 --> 10:55.654
Oh...

10:56.907 --> 10:58.106
This can't be happening.

11:00.110 --> 11:02.643
You...You really think
bridgette is the extortionist?

11:02.746 --> 11:04.979
-She could be a crime boss.
-A crime boss?

11:05.082 --> 11:06.981
Don't sleep.
We don't know
how deep this goes.

11:07.084 --> 11:09.650

some of our money.

11:11.922 --> 11:14.839
-We should loop dana
in on this.
-Oh, hell no!

11:14.958 --> 11:18.677
No. He's already throwing me
shade for not acting on
otis earlier.

11:19.463 --> 11:20.762
No.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.631
Let's just wait a beat.
Because, if I'm wrong
about this too,

11:23.717 --> 11:24.849
no one'll trust me.

11:27.054 --> 11:30.355
We need otis to wake up
and clear his name,

11:30.474 --> 11:34.142
or we need to find
some more evidence
tying bridgette to the crime.

11:34.227 --> 11:37.278
I'm gonna call quincy,
have him do some digging
so we can work this out.

I promise,
I'll keep it under wraps.

extorting him

are you crazy?
I loved your dad

-Better?

21:31.507 --> 21:34.008
Yeah. [shivering]

21:34.093 --> 21:37.094
you haven't had a panic attack
since you gave that speech
at the wine gala in tuscany

21:37.180 --> 21:39.230
-and peeped george clooney
in the audience.
-Mm-hm.

21:39.315 --> 21:40.314
I'm just worried.

21:41.517 --> 21:43.184
I'm scared of what we're gonna
find out.

21:43.286 --> 21:44.652
Let's just play it a day,
at a time.

21:46.356 --> 21:49.273

Now that otis was
only lifting grapes.

21:49.359 --> 21:51.192
Quincy get intel
on another suspect?

21:52.495 --> 21:54.645
What? I tell him everything.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.614
But I didn't tell him about
how we found evidence pointing

21:56.699 --> 21:57.865
to bridgette being
the extortionist.

21:59.252 --> 22:00.618
Bridgette?

22:00.703 --> 22:02.486
Are you kidding?
But, she's the honest one.

22:02.588 --> 22:04.422
Always did things right,
by the book.

22:04.507 --> 22:07.291

at her house
and at work, so...

22:08.294 --> 22:09.844
-Maybe we'll find something.
-Cameras?

22:11.047 --> 22:12.296
If all roads
point to bridgette,

22:13.182 --> 22:14.382
then we'll take her down.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.434
Maybe, having her work
is a good idea.

22:16.519 --> 22:20.554
True that. Recon missions
worked well in the second
liberian civil war.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.107
I'm surprised you're
agreeing with me.

22:23.192 --> 22:25.976
I don't wanna see
bridgette in jail,
but if she's the extortionist,

22:26.062 --> 22:27.445
then that's where she belongs.

-Bridgette and rose

off that cheddar.

27:51.937 --> 27:53.303
I don't understand.

27:53.389 --> 27:56.357
Every time we asked about her,
you all had an excuse.

27:56.859 --> 27:58.475
"she's a recluse",

27:58.561 --> 27:59.943
"she hates weddings".

28:00.029 --> 28:01.945
Every trip we took to paris,

28:02.031 --> 28:06.066
we wanted to meet her,
you all said she wasn't
interested in meeting us.

28:06.152 --> 28:08.569
That she never really
wanted to be a grandmother.

28:08.654 --> 28:11.238
Sadly, I don't think
she ever wanted to be
a mother either.

28:13.292 --> 28:14.825
What's wrong with her

28:14.910 --> 28:17.194
she had a nervous breakdown
after my dad died.

28:18.164 --> 28:22.032
She's been in a
dissociative state ever since

28:22.134 --> 28:23.634
mom said,
grandpa had a heart attack.

28:24.136 --> 28:25.386
No, she lied.

28:26.689 --> 28:27.871
The truth is, bridgette,

28:27.973 --> 28:29.673
your mom was a wild child

28:29.759 --> 28:32.509
and my parents,
they couldn't control her.

28:32.595 --> 28:36.096
You know, one night,
she came home piss drunk
and I...

28:36.182 --> 28:40.517
Dolling out all kinds of
lies and excused like a pro.

28:40.603 --> 28:43.987
And she went on a tirade,
yelling and screaming
at my dad

28:44.073 --> 28:45.856
and then she attacked him.

28:45.941 --> 28:47.658
He died from an aneurism,

28:47.743 --> 28:49.860
brought on by
all the yelling at your mom.

28:50.413 --> 28:51.995
Oh my god!

28:53.115 --> 28:55.532
Why did you all
keep these secrets?

28:55.618 --> 28:59.286
Why hold everything...
Why do any of this?

28:59.371 --> 29:02.072
Bridgette, it's what
our parents taught us.

29:02.174 --> 29:04.675
Look, I'm telling you
about this

29:04.760 --> 29:06.927

who your mother is.

29:07.680 --> 29:08.879

29:10.132 --> 29:12.132
But if your going to be
back in the fold,

29:13.219 --> 29:14.468
you need to let her go.

29:15.237 --> 29:16.270

30:06.272 --> 30:08.638

rest before the harvest.

30:08.741 --> 30:11.692
No, I'm good.
The vines calmed me down...

30:11.777 --> 30:14.661

I left it when I came
to help christian.

check on the vines.
-Okay.

And you clearly
closed the deal.

32:14.199 --> 32:15.098
[chuckles] yeah.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.650
I did that

32:17.369 --> 32:18.735
I cracked that nut.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.371
Cracked it real hard.

32:22.041 --> 32:23.290
With this...

32:23.409 --> 32:25.742
And some other assets

32:26.495 --> 32:27.494
so...

32:28.414 --> 32:29.913
Well, a deal's a deal.

32:29.999 --> 32:30.998
Welcome home.

32:32.084 --> 32:33.083
[chuckles softly]

32:35.421 --> 32:36.586
is that my robe?

32:36.889 --> 32:37.754
Ah...

32:40.259 --> 32:42.592
-[chuckles softly]
-oh, the nerve!

32:46.849 --> 32:49.483
You're bugging me now asshole?

32:49.601 --> 32:51.351
Those are part of
quincy's repertoire.

32:51.437 --> 32:54.438
Mm, congratulations aug,
you figured it out

32:54.523 --> 32:57.357
and look at you giving me
second-rate
angela lansbury vibes.

32:57.443 --> 32:59.443
How could you spy
on your own sister?

32:59.945 --> 33:01.161
That's nasty.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.280
A, I didn't put one
in your bedroom and b,

33:03.365 --> 33:05.532
you did the exact same thing
to bridgette.

33:05.617 --> 33:07.367
C, I haven't seen anything
for days.

33:07.453 --> 33:08.618
Camera's damn battery died.

33:09.421 --> 33:11.038
So, what was this about?

33:11.123 --> 33:12.622
Oh, you thought
I was extorting dad?

33:12.708 --> 33:14.541
[gasps] no, I thought
you were weak

33:14.626 --> 33:17.878
and unable to handle
someone of my prestige
coaching you from the side.

33:17.963 --> 33:20.180
And I was right. You are weak.

33:20.299 --> 33:25.185
Not only obsessing over
kelvin's ex-wife, like some
lionsgate movie,

33:25.304 --> 33:27.137
quincy's footage show
that you were planning
to fire me.

33:27.940 --> 33:29.806
-Wait, what?
-Don't deny it.

33:29.892 --> 33:32.192
I saw the video with
my own baby browns.

33:32.311 --> 33:34.478
You were looking at
cfo resumes to replace me.

33:35.814 --> 33:37.564
[chuckling]

33:39.618 --> 33:41.401
[laughs heartily]

33:41.487 --> 33:42.986
oh my god!

33:43.455 --> 33:45.372
Oh yeah...

33:45.491 --> 33:48.408
Yes, I was
interviewing candidates.

33:48.494 --> 33:50.994
I was so sick of you
on your ninja-grind

33:51.080 --> 33:54.548
trying to snatch my crown,
that I was looking to bring on
a new cfo

33:54.666 --> 33:57.167
to promote you,

33:57.252 --> 34:00.837
to co-president with me
so we could put all this
tension behind us.

34:01.757 --> 34:04.257
You're lying.
I don't believe you.

34:04.343 --> 34:05.976
I even had paul
draw up the paperwork.

34:07.646 --> 34:13.016
But, not only were you
dead wrong about otis
being the extortionist

34:13.102 --> 34:14.601
and nearly killed the man,

34:14.686 --> 34:17.938
but now you're also
way off the mark about me.

34:19.825 --> 34:21.724
Why do you hate me so much?

34:21.827 --> 34:26.196
'cause you have
unjustifiably been spoiled
your entire life.

34:28.867 --> 34:30.700
You know what? I'm done...

34:31.670 --> 34:33.537
Being nice to you.

34:33.622 --> 34:37.374
'cause clearly, promoting you
would have been the dumbest
mistake I have ever made.

34:39.178 --> 34:42.546
Oh and by the way,
I am keeping both my eyes
open for kelvin,

34:42.631 --> 34:44.247
because I had a dad
who cheated

34:44.349 --> 34:46.716
and I have a brother
who bugged my god damn house.

34:48.220 --> 34:49.719
I will not...

34:49.805 --> 34:52.055
End up with a two-faced sneak

34:52.141 --> 34:53.306
like either of you.

you wanted to hang.

35:12.411 --> 35:15.111
Oh, I needed to take my mind
off about everything.

35:15.214 --> 35:17.080
-Yeah.
-All extortionist, no play?

-[chuckles]
-that shit was fly.

35:54.703 --> 35:57.954
Oh okay.
Well, all the girls
were jealous of me.

35:58.957 --> 36:00.373
-Mm.
-You were fine as hell.

36:01.126 --> 36:02.292
You were finer.

36:02.377 --> 36:04.494
-Oh, yeah?
-Strutting down them hallways
in that...

36:04.596 --> 36:06.346

-Mm-hm.

36:22.314 --> 36:24.481
I don't know if you remember,
but, uh...

36:25.901 --> 36:27.484
Pinot was our drink
back in the day.

36:27.569 --> 36:29.119
Why do you think
I stopped drinking it?

36:29.655 --> 36:31.071
You and pinot go together.

36:31.657 --> 36:33.240
Mm...

36:33.325 --> 36:35.909
When we broke up,
I couldn't touch this stuff
without missing you, so...

36:36.662 --> 36:38.361
-I just quit.
-Really?

36:38.463 --> 36:39.663
Yes, really.
