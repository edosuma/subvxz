I can't believe we're
getting extra credit

00:06.289 --> 00:07.373
just for going to an opera.

00:07.456 --> 00:09.790

We're earning it.

00:09.873 --> 00:11.623
Oh! There's Amanda.

00:11.706 --> 00:13.248

00:13.331 --> 00:15.456
Oh, no, no, it's just that...

00:15.539 --> 00:18.456

school, you know?

00:18.539 --> 00:20.456

00:20.539 --> 00:21.706
Excuse me.

00:23.581 --> 00:24.665
-Hey, Amanda.
-Milo!

00:24.748 --> 00:27.289

00:27.373 --> 00:29.623
[chuckles awkwardly]
What are you doing here?

00:29.706 --> 00:31.456
Extra credit for Mrs. White's class.

00:31.539 --> 00:33.498
You can sit with us in
the center if you want.

00:33.581 --> 00:35.665
I bought an extra seat in
case mine got destroyed.

00:35.748 --> 00:37.665
How would your seat get destroyed?

00:37.748 --> 00:39.581
It's best not to speculate.

00:39.665 --> 00:41.289
Okay, that's why I'm, well...

00:41.373 --> 00:42.539
I'm a little nervous.

00:42.623 --> 00:44.082
What I love about opera is that

00:44.165 --> 00:46.289
it's so well-rehearsed and predictable.

00:46.373 --> 00:49.957
And the thing is,
there's just so much that could go wrong

00:50.040 --> 00:52.498
in this general area.

00:52.581 --> 00:54.331
-Oh, that!
-[bone cracks]

00:54.414 --> 00:56.665
Oh, don't worry! Murphy's Law or not,

00:58.289 --> 01:01.207
I hope so because it's just that I have...

01:02.623 --> 01:04.498
-Milo.
-Huh? Oh!

01:04.581 --> 01:07.123
Because I'm using up three of my
scheduled enjoyment hours for this.

01:07.207 --> 01:09.498
You schedule time to enjoy things?

01:09.581 --> 01:10.665
How else am I going to fit it in?

01:10.748 --> 01:12.957
Wow! Every minute of your
day is accounted for.

"Wednesday, 10:50 to 10:55,
peel and eat an orange."

01:16.831 --> 01:19.665
This opera takes exactly
two hours and 11 minutes,

01:19.748 --> 01:21.957
plus, I set aside an extra 1.5 minutes,

01:22.040 --> 01:24.289
for an ovation,
just in case it's really good.

01:24.373 --> 01:27.373
My enjoyment hours are very precious to
me, nothing can go wrong.

01:27.456 --> 01:29.665
Don't worry, Amanda,
I'll be there to help.

01:29.748 --> 01:32.373
Oh, that's great.

01:32.456 --> 01:34.539
You realize that you could
shave a good three minutes

01:34.623 --> 01:37.539

if you switch to tangerines.

01:37.623 --> 01:38.706

01:38.790 --> 01:40.165
So what's with the big ugly tie?

01:40.248 --> 01:41.873
This is an ascot.

01:41.957 --> 01:44.915
The last time I wore something that
big, they brought me a lobster.

01:44.998 --> 01:48.790
What I'm saying is,
it looks like a lobster bib.

01:48.873 --> 01:50.915
When you're in a restaurant
and you order a lobster...

01:50.998 --> 01:52.790
I get it! Excuse me.

01:52.873 --> 01:54.998
May I have some
pistachios, please?

01:55.082 --> 01:57.248
I'm sorry, my good man,

01:57.331 --> 01:59.539
but it seems that we're fresh
out of pistachios at the moment.

01:59.623 --> 02:00.748
Yeah, we're all out.

02:00.831 --> 02:02.998
But, aren't those
pistachios right behind you?

02:03.082 --> 02:05.790
Yes, well, uh, you see...

02:05.873 --> 02:08.165
Those are display pistachios.

02:08.248 --> 02:10.414
We're not allowed to
sell display pistachios.

02:10.498 --> 02:13.165
Wouldn't you prefer a
rubbery-like woodland creature

02:13.248 --> 02:15.165
to chew on instead, hmm?

02:15.248 --> 02:17.539

some pistachios, please.

That's a rather presumptuous accusation.

02:31.998 --> 02:34.289
Yes. It's not like we tied up
the guy who usually does this

02:34.373 --> 02:36.623
