00:17.385 --> 00:19.752
He knows that you
came to me for help.

00:19.754 --> 00:21.387
So he's put me in his game.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.155
<i> Hein, Larsen, and Shaw</i>

00:23.157 --> 00:24.323
all have something in common.

00:24.325 --> 00:26.258
Each one of them
was being investigated

00:26.260 --> 00:28.427
by an HPD homicide detective

00:28.429 --> 00:29.561
named Philip Lau.

00:29.563 --> 00:32.131
He shot and killed himself
six months ago.

00:32.133 --> 00:34.266
Detective Lau was seeing
a police shrink.

00:34.268 --> 00:37.136
If he talked about his cases,
then she might know something...

00:37.138 --> 00:39.805
(echoing):
<i> ...something.</i>

00:39.807 --> 00:42.474
Motive is usually
based on psychological

00:42.476 --> 00:44.443
or sexual gratification.

00:44.445 --> 00:48.147
Lust, thrill, power.

00:48.149 --> 00:51.817
These are what drive
the serial killer.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.719
Now, as you can see
from the faces up here,

00:53.721 --> 00:56.655
serial killers are
predominantly male.

00:56.657 --> 00:59.725
Now, there has been
a lot of research

00:59.727 --> 01:01.794
and speculation as to why
there have been

01:01.796 --> 01:03.813
so few female serial killers.

01:03.814 --> 01:05.831
Women deal with their emotions
better than men,

01:05.833 --> 01:08.333
women are less violent, even
when psychologically impaired,

01:08.335 --> 01:10.169
but the fact of the matter is,

01:10.171 --> 01:12.404
is that women are less likely
than men to commit

01:12.406 --> 01:14.239
any type of violent crime.

01:15.342 --> 01:17.426
Yeah.

01:17.427 --> 01:19.511
Is it accurate to say
that when women kill,

01:19.513 --> 01:22.147
they do so to defend themselves
from male aggression?

01:22.149 --> 01:23.749
It is accurate, yes.

01:23.751 --> 01:26.618
So, if the very term
"serial killer"

01:26.620 --> 01:28.320
is defined by sexual motivation

01:28.322 --> 01:31.590
and the desire for power
over their victims,

01:31.592 --> 01:33.625
that would alleviate
almost all female murderers.

01:33.627 --> 01:38.130
That is a very astute
observation, young lady.

01:38.132 --> 01:40.332
(distorted):
What, may I ask, is your name?

01:40.334 --> 01:43.669
My name is Sienna Brown, ma'am.

01:43.671 --> 01:44.670
You know me very well.

01:44.672 --> 01:45.604
I'm your daughter.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.439
(students chuckle)

01:49.143 --> 01:51.210

02:10.364 --> 02:11.530
Alicia?

02:11.532 --> 02:13.599
Steve!

02:14.869 --> 02:18.370
<i> (Hawaii Five-O </i>

02:45.900 --> 02:49.268
Alicia.

02:49.270 --> 02:52.171
What's the matter?

03:03.817 --> 03:05.751
(door opens)

03:05.753 --> 03:09.288
My apologies, I've been running
a little behind today.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.689
You must be Alicia.

03:10.691 --> 03:11.623
Hi.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.192
And you are?

03:13.194 --> 03:14.626
Commander Steve McGarrett.
Of course.

03:14.628 --> 03:15.961
I've heard great things.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.597
I'm Madison Gray,
so how can I help you?

03:18.599 --> 03:19.932
Oh, we wanted to ask you
a couple of questions

03:19.934 --> 03:20.966
about an ex-patient of yours,

03:20.968 --> 03:23.302
Detective Philip Lau.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.571
Yes, tragic what happened.

03:25.573 --> 03:26.638
Mm.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.906
Please sit.

03:27.908 --> 03:29.841
STEVE:
Thank you.

03:29.843 --> 03:32.311
We, uh... we've been trying
to understand it ourselves.

03:32.313 --> 03:35.647
Tell me something, did Detective
Lau discuss any of the cases

03:35.649 --> 03:37.716
he was investigating with you?

03:37.718 --> 03:39.318
Well, we primarily
discussed his personal issues,

03:39.320 --> 03:41.486
his relationship
with his ex-wife mostly.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.539
Hmm.

03:43.540 --> 03:45.591
Detective Lau was working three
separate multiple homicides

03:45.593 --> 03:47.726
and getting nowhere fast.

03:47.728 --> 03:48.894
He never discussed those?

03:48.896 --> 03:50.796
Not to my recollection, no.

03:50.798 --> 03:51.797
I find it hard to believe

03:51.799 --> 03:52.864
that he wouldn't...

03:52.866 --> 03:55.267
share those
frustrations with you.

03:55.269 --> 03:56.602
Detective Lau
was struggling through

03:56.604 --> 03:58.003
a very painful separation.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.905
And that might explain
his inability

03:59.907 --> 04:02.741
to clear those cases.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.443
It is what caused him
to take his own life.

04:04.445 --> 04:07.980
Except he didn't kill himself.

04:07.982 --> 04:09.381
He was murdered.

04:12.453 --> 04:15.887
We exhumed his body earlier
this week and confirmed

04:15.889 --> 04:17.656
Ms. Brown's theory
that this was,

04:17.658 --> 04:19.024
in fact, a homicide,

04:19.026 --> 04:20.492
which means we're gonna
need to see

04:20.494 --> 04:21.960
those session notes.

04:24.031 --> 04:26.498
(soft chuckle)
Of course.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.834
I can get you everything
by tomorrow morning.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.769
STEVE: Yeah, you don't play
poker, do you?

04:30.771 --> 04:32.371
I don't believe in games.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.806
I put my cards on the table
and I see if they blink.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.808
Well, she didn't blink.
She will.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.310
We shouldn't have left
without those notes.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.545
Listen, just because
there's a book on chess

04:40.547 --> 04:41.546
in there on the bookshelf,

04:41.548 --> 04:42.781
doesn't make her
a serial killer,

04:42.783 --> 04:43.982
you understand that, right?

04:43.984 --> 04:45.951
You're a cop.
You know this job.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.819
When you're on a case,
it's all you can think about.

04:47.821 --> 04:50.656
And that goes double when you're
investigating a serial murderer.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.358
You have to get
inside their head,

04:52.359 --> 04:54.059
think like them, anticipate their moves...
I understand that, okay?

04:54.061 --> 04:55.527
It becomes your life.

04:55.529 --> 04:56.862
Sometimes to a dangerous point

04:56.864 --> 04:57.996
where you almost
start to identify

04:57.998 --> 04:58.997
with the monster
you're chasing.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.433
There is no way...

05:01.435 --> 05:05.637
no way that Detective Lau
went to see a shrink

05:05.639 --> 05:07.706
and only talked
about his ex-wife.

05:09.943 --> 05:12.511
Okay.
I'm gonna brief my team.

05:12.513 --> 05:15.914
Okay. All right, we're gonna start
with the handwriting sample,

05:15.916 --> 05:18.550
run it against the note
we found on Hank...

05:19.987 --> 05:21.987
...and the one we found
at the Larsen crime scene.

05:23.057 --> 05:25.824
What shall I do next?
You're gonna stand down

05:25.826 --> 05:28.627
until I tell you otherwise.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.798
I bet you my pension that
she calls tomorrow morning

05:32.800 --> 05:34.099
and says that
she can't find the notes.

05:34.101 --> 05:37.436
You know, I read your book.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.571
According to your own words,

05:39.573 --> 05:41.673
serial killers,
predominantly male.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.575
Hmm.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.877
You know, I've been
on the sidelines for years.

05:45.879 --> 05:46.945

Oh, excuse me, malasada.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.156
Hawaiian donut.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.958
Fried cake batter,
tropical waffle.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.760
I don't give a damn

seafood in it, big fella.

about donuts.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.003
Malasadas.
Yuck.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.540
And, you know what, Kamekona,
if you're gonna be shipping

06:48.542 --> 06:50.976
a taste of...
Hawaii to the mainland,

06:50.978 --> 06:53.678
maybe you should
just stick with the staples.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.669
You know, nothing fancy,

06:55.670 --> 06:57.659
just the same grindz
that we eat.

06:57.660 --> 06:59.649
Kamekona Club is a
food of the month club.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.453
If I don't expand my menu,

07:01.455 --> 07:03.155
I'll be out of
options by December.

07:03.157 --> 07:06.625
Creative expansion
is the key to success.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.460
Yeah, but giving your customers
anaphylactic shock

07:08.462 --> 07:09.795
is the key to bankruptcy.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.163
KAMEKONA:
Maybe you just don't have

07:11.165 --> 07:12.731
a sophisticated palate.

07:12.733 --> 07:15.100
You know, I think my palate
is sophisticated enough

07:15.102 --> 07:17.169
to eat off a truck.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.208
(sighs)

07:26.647 --> 07:30.015
Hey, brother.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.452
No way.

07:33.454 --> 07:35.187
Otis Wilson?

07:35.189 --> 07:36.488

Otis Wilson,
number 55 linebacker

07:37.791 --> 07:40.025

Chicago Bears,

07:40.027 --> 07:41.126
greatest team in NFL history?

07:41.128 --> 07:42.194
Otis Wilson?
That'd be me.

07:42.196 --> 07:43.195
Oh!

07:43.197 --> 07:44.162
What's your name?

07:44.164 --> 07:47.132
I'm, uh...
I'm, uh...

07:48.168 --> 07:50.569
Lou! Lou Grover.
I'm Lou Grover.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.170
Nice to meet you. Oh, it's a
pleasure, my man, it's a pleasure.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.638
I work with
local law enforcement,

07:53.640 --> 07:55.173
the Five-O task force here.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.575
But-- uh, but don't worry, man,

07:56.576 --> 07:57.976
you could tackle
anybody on the beach,

07:57.978 --> 07:59.845
I wouldn't even arrest you.
Well, I appreciate that.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.813
All right!
Yeah, by the way,

08:01.815 --> 08:02.914
have you eaten here before?

08:02.916 --> 08:03.915
Oh, yeah, all the time.

08:03.917 --> 08:04.850
What's good on the menu?

08:04.852 --> 08:06.551
Everything.

08:06.553 --> 08:08.687
But don't ever,

08:08.689 --> 08:10.889
I mean ever,

08:10.891 --> 08:12.791
order one of them shrimp donuts.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.694
Shrimp...
I know.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.162
in a donut?
Yes, sir.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.998
So I heard your
man's getting out early.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.117
Yeah, Adam's lawyers

08:22.118 --> 08:24.235
leveraged what he did
during the prisoner escape.

08:24.238 --> 08:27.105
Uh, the fact that he helped
Five-O round up the fugitives

08:27.107 --> 08:28.707
got him an early parole.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.542
He comes home in
a couple of days.

08:32.045 --> 08:34.513
That's good, sistah.

08:34.515 --> 08:35.914
You two deserve to be happy.

08:35.916 --> 08:38.517
Thanks.

08:42.256 --> 08:43.889
Faster.

08:43.891 --> 08:45.190
Faster?

08:45.192 --> 08:46.958
(with accent): You are very

08:46.960 --> 08:48.660
difficult woman.

08:48.662 --> 08:51.062
(both chuckle)
Perhaps so, Your Majesty.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.698
(chuckles)

08:53.700 --> 08:56.668
Uncle Chin, can we watch
another old movie tonight?

08:56.670 --> 08:58.287
Sure.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.905
As long as you eat all your
dinner, brush your teeth,

08:59.907 --> 09:01.673
and say your prayers.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.708
(with accent):
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.578
(chuckles)
I promise.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.179
(chuckles)

09:14.221 --> 09:16.688
Hey, boo, I think it's time
we head in, okay?

09:16.690 --> 09:17.822
Okay.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.326
Uncle Jerry!

09:21.327 --> 09:23.093
Hiya, sweetheart,
give me some sugar.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.864
Hey, Sara, honey, will you do me
a favor and go get our towels?

09:25.866 --> 09:27.666
Sure.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.002
Hey.
Everything okay?

09:31.004 --> 09:32.704
I don't know.

09:32.706 --> 09:35.340
Crime lab processed that
Cali cartel guy's cell phone.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.842
Turns out one of his
contacts is the family

09:37.844 --> 09:41.212
that Sara is going to
live with in Mexico City.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.164
Now,

09:43.165 --> 09:45.115
it doesn't mean
they're in the drug business.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.686
You wouldn't be here if
you didn't think they were.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.593
(camera shutter clicking)

09:59.633 --> 10:01.232
Heard they sometimes do
ten weddings a day here.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.934
Yeah, whoever
said love is dead

10:02.936 --> 10:05.670
clearly never
heard of this place.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.606
How's Abby liking her new job?

10:07.608 --> 10:09.708
So far she's happy.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.043
And from everything I hear,
HPD's really happy with her.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.813
Glad to hear it.

10:16.817 --> 10:19.050
So, thanks for coming.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.752
I wasn't sure whether you would.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.854
Well, your message
said it was urgent.

10:22.855 --> 10:24.955
I have to admit, I was a little
surprised to hear from you,

10:24.958 --> 10:27.092
I didn't know where
you and I stood.

10:27.094 --> 10:28.827
Look, as far as I'm
concerned, we're good.

10:28.829 --> 10:29.894
In fact, we may
even owe you one.

10:29.896 --> 10:30.895
If it weren't for you,

10:30.897 --> 10:33.031
that thing in Chinatown--

10:33.033 --> 10:34.299
that might've ended
very differently.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.737
Well, I'm glad
we cleared the air.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.772
Me, too.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.974
So, what's going on?
What did you want to talk about?

10:44.244 --> 10:46.177
I wanted to talk
to you about Sara,

10:46.179 --> 10:48.647
Gabriel Waincroft's daughter.
Okay.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.715
I don't know if you know,
but for the past six weeks,

10:50.717 --> 10:51.950
she's been living with me.

10:51.952 --> 10:52.951
But recently,

10:52.953 --> 10:54.753
her mother's family
back in Mexico

10:54.755 --> 10:56.988
has taken steps to adopt her.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.958
Before I let her go,
I just wanted to be 100% sure

10:59.960 --> 11:01.292
she was going to a good home.

11:01.294 --> 11:02.427
You run background on them?

11:02.429 --> 11:04.262
I did, and they came back
clean, but now

11:04.264 --> 11:06.231
some evidence
has come to light that...

11:06.233 --> 11:08.400
suggests otherwise.

11:08.402 --> 11:10.368
Let me guess-- you want
me to look into them?

11:10.370 --> 11:12.037
I know it's a big ask.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.805
But you're a U.S. Attorney.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.407
You've worked
with the Federales in Mexico.

11:15.409 --> 11:16.741
I'm guessing
your contacts over there

11:16.743 --> 11:17.776
are much stronger than mine.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.010
What are their names?

11:19.012 --> 11:22.347
Jorge and Maria Morales.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.115
They're from Juárez.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.717
Give me 72 hours.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.353
I appreciate it.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.689
(phone ringing)

11:30.691 --> 11:31.956
Yeah. McGarrett.

11:31.958 --> 11:32.957
ALICIA:
It's her.

11:32.959 --> 11:33.992
I told you, we got her.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.060
Alicia, slow down.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.094
What are you talking about?

11:36.096 --> 11:37.962
Dr. Gray.
I'm in her house.

11:37.964 --> 11:39.381
You're what?!

11:39.382 --> 11:40.799
You need to get
out of there right now!

11:40.801 --> 11:43.435
She's got three files
on the serials she murdered.

11:43.437 --> 11:45.970
And two more
we had no idea about.

11:45.972 --> 11:47.939
There's a reason that that book
was in her office.

11:47.941 --> 11:48.973
Stop and listen to me!

11:48.975 --> 11:50.141
You broke into her house.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.209
All that evidence is tainted.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.243
I'm not a cop anymore.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.528
Remember?

11:53.529 --> 11:54.812
Just come and arrest me
for B and E,

11:54.815 --> 11:57.282
and you'll happen
to stumble onto this stuff.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.483
We need more than files.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.418
You know that.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.053
Well, how about
an 11th century chess set

12:02.055 --> 12:03.855
with seven pieces missing?

12:03.857 --> 12:05.190
Seven?

12:05.192 --> 12:07.192
We received four pawns
and a knight and now

12:07.194 --> 12:09.260
the king and queen
are missing, too.

12:09.262 --> 12:10.862
(siren wailing)

12:10.864 --> 12:12.731
(tires screeching)

12:20.373 --> 12:22.073
Alicia?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.172
(shouts)

13:12.259 --> 13:14.159
Hey, Steve, it's me.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.227
We're all here.
Where are you?

13:18.231 --> 13:19.564
Still not picking up?

13:19.566 --> 13:20.799
Yeah.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.000
You tried Danny?

13:22.002 --> 13:23.568
GROVER: Yeah,
I spoke to him.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.270
He said he hasn't talked to
Steve since he left for Jersey.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.238
(sighs)
I don't know.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.140
It's been two hours.
That man is never late.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.342
Did he say what he wanted?

13:31.344 --> 13:33.278
He said that he and Alicia
may have a suspect,

13:33.280 --> 13:34.846
and that he would update us
when he got here.

13:34.848 --> 13:38.149
Kono, can you run a trace
on his phone, please?

13:38.151 --> 13:39.984
Yeah.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.122
We'll find him.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.900
(grunting)

13:55.902 --> 13:56.868
(screams)

14:05.979 --> 14:09.314
(panting)

14:15.889 --> 14:17.956
Has anyone told him anything?

14:22.896 --> 14:25.263
I'm gonna ask this
one more time,

14:25.265 --> 14:27.398
as it is critical.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.535
Has anyone here
mentioned that this...

14:30.537 --> 14:32.971
suspected victim is missing,

14:32.973 --> 14:35.173
unaccounted for,

14:35.175 --> 14:36.307
AWOL, anything?

14:36.309 --> 14:39.010
No, ma'am.

14:39.012 --> 14:41.079
We said nothing.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.183
I'm going in alone.

14:45.185 --> 14:48.186
Edward Sears is not like
anyone we've had in here before.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.888
I'm not comfortable with you
doing this one on one.

14:49.890 --> 14:52.190
Your comfort's
not my concern, Warden.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.291
And I work alone.

14:53.293 --> 14:54.325
Buzz me in.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.060
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

14:56.062 --> 14:58.129
(man humming)

15:02.168 --> 15:04.469
There she is.

15:04.471 --> 15:08.306
The preeminent
mind hunter.

15:08.308 --> 15:12.410
The queen tracker
of serial killers.

15:12.412 --> 15:16.948
What do you have for
me today, Agent Brown?

15:16.950 --> 15:20.051
Just checking in on you, Edward.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.220
Seeing how you're doing.

15:23.957 --> 15:26.124
You're lying, Alicia.

15:26.126 --> 15:29.060
I know why you're here.

15:29.062 --> 15:32.597
Your daughter.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.133
Your only child.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.101
You know, it's sad
when our loved ones

15:37.103 --> 15:39.370
don't live up
to our high standards.

15:42.676 --> 15:44.542
What do you know?

15:44.544 --> 15:47.045
What do I know?

15:50.350 --> 15:52.617
I know young Sienna
isn't half the agent

15:52.619 --> 15:54.352
her mother is.

15:54.354 --> 15:58.056
That if she were,

15:58.058 --> 16:01.359
her career might've lasted
a little longer.

16:03.596 --> 16:06.431
(water running)

16:12.572 --> 16:15.340
How'd you get those men
to kill for you?

16:18.979 --> 16:21.145
Detective Lau was
looking at them

16:21.147 --> 16:23.147
as suspects in three
open homicides.

16:23.149 --> 16:26.050
But... I want to know

16:26.052 --> 16:29.387
how... how you convinced them

16:29.389 --> 16:31.356
to kill for you.

16:37.397 --> 16:40.565
Did you threaten
to turn them in?

16:40.567 --> 16:41.532
That what you did?

16:41.534 --> 16:44.302
You make a deal with them?

16:44.304 --> 16:46.237
Your silence for a little blood?

16:50.744 --> 16:54.779
They served their purpose
and you got rid of them.

16:56.282 --> 16:59.083
You're a smart woman, Dr.
Gray, I'll give you that.

16:59.085 --> 17:01.252
But I don't think you really
thought this through.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.688
Oh, I've thought about it,
trust me.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.391
Here's the thing.

17:07.761 --> 17:11.095
Your crimes,
your crimes consist

17:11.097 --> 17:13.331
of killing some
pretty bad men.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.401
Serial murderers.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.371
But killing cops.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.540
Not gonna look too
kindly on that.

17:23.510 --> 17:24.609
Are you saying

17:24.611 --> 17:26.611
that I shouldn't kill you two?

17:26.613 --> 17:28.146
That's what I'm saying.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.151
Okay, then I won't.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.353
She won't engage with logic.

17:35.355 --> 17:38.523
She doesn't think that way.

17:38.525 --> 17:39.690
It has nothing
to do with logic.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.692
The game isn't over yet.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.561
STEVE:
That's right.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.429
Not until you get the
king and queen, right?

17:45.432 --> 17:46.798
So, why don't
you tell me,

17:46.800 --> 17:48.699
Doctor, who are the king
and the queen?

17:49.536 --> 17:50.768
Alicia?

17:50.770 --> 17:52.370
Alicia?

17:52.372 --> 17:54.505
Alicia, stay awake.

17:54.507 --> 17:55.573
Do not pass out.

17:56.342 --> 17:58.309
(grunts)

18:02.082 --> 18:03.514
How's the signal?

18:03.516 --> 18:04.849
Still strong.
Stay north.

18:09.389 --> 18:11.589
Guys, McGarrett should be
right in front of you.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.760
You sure about that?

18:15.762 --> 18:17.095
Positive.

18:17.097 --> 18:18.796
He's moving.
He's heading right for you.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.337
(tires screech)

18:27.273 --> 18:30.308
(siren wailing)

18:38.151 --> 18:39.250
Out!

18:39.252 --> 18:42.420
Get out!
Hands where I can see them!

18:42.422 --> 18:43.688
Steve McGarrett--
where is he?!

18:43.690 --> 18:45.356
I don't know who that is.

18:45.358 --> 18:46.591
I'm gonna check the back.

18:46.593 --> 18:47.692
Where is he?!
I don't know.

18:47.694 --> 18:48.793
I'm telling you the truth,
I swear.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.429
Turn around.

18:56.402 --> 18:58.169
Well, do you have him?

18:58.171 --> 19:00.471
No, it's just a mail truck
with a bunch of packages.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.873
You sure about this?

19:02.742 --> 19:03.774
Hang on a second.

19:03.776 --> 19:04.876
Jerry's calling his phone.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.713
(phone ringing)

19:12.719 --> 19:14.619
(line ringing)

19:14.621 --> 19:17.488
(phone ringing)

19:17.490 --> 19:19.557
(louder ringing)

19:25.231 --> 19:26.330
Where did this come from?

19:26.332 --> 19:27.732
I don't... I don't know.

19:27.734 --> 19:28.866
There's no return address.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.735
But I must've picked it up
on my route.

19:30.737 --> 19:31.736
What's the route?

19:31.738 --> 19:32.770
Uh, Kahala primarily.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.939
Uh, Diamond Head
to Kealaolu.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.574
That's got to be
three square miles.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.748
(Alicia groans)

19:43.750 --> 19:45.850
You...

19:47.754 --> 19:49.587
...you like...

19:49.589 --> 19:52.690
everything... perfect.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.425
Don't you?

19:57.230 --> 19:58.896
(grunts)

19:58.898 --> 20:00.698
(yelps)

20:00.700 --> 20:01.766
Who doesn't?

20:01.768 --> 20:02.900
Yeah.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.236
But you're like a...

20:05.238 --> 20:07.371
total control freak.

20:07.373 --> 20:10.908
Look at this house.

20:10.910 --> 20:13.277
It's like a museum.

20:13.279 --> 20:16.581
You just can't stop
cleaning things even though

20:16.583 --> 20:20.351
everything's already clean.

20:20.353 --> 20:23.254
I mean, everyone's got a little

20:23.256 --> 20:25.656
OCD, but you're like

20:25.658 --> 20:28.593
off the charts.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.628
You think you know me?

20:34.267 --> 20:37.735
Yeah, in fact, I do.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.438
I mean, I think you,

20:40.440 --> 20:43.341
I think you had it tough
growing up.

20:43.343 --> 20:45.843
I think that one
of your parents

20:45.845 --> 20:48.279
was bipolar
and the other one was

20:48.281 --> 20:50.982
completely under their sway.

20:50.984 --> 20:53.951
Terrified.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.419
And that made

20:55.421 --> 20:58.522
you... terrified, didn't it?

20:59.692 --> 21:00.992
Yeah.

21:02.795 --> 21:04.862
I think it was your dad.

21:07.300 --> 21:10.268
I think that he's
the one who...

21:10.270 --> 21:12.536
taught you chess.

21:12.538 --> 21:16.274
In your room.

21:16.276 --> 21:18.676
With the door locked.

21:20.046 --> 21:23.047
But he'd never
let you win.

21:23.049 --> 21:27.051
He just couldn't
let go of that control.

21:29.055 --> 21:33.424
Which was one of the reasons
that you hated the game.

21:33.426 --> 21:37.461
But it wasn't
the only reason, was it?

21:37.463 --> 21:41.365
Because you didn't
just play chess.

21:41.367 --> 21:43.434
Did you?

21:46.005 --> 21:48.973
Ah, the profiler at work.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.308
(scoffs)

21:50.310 --> 21:53.344
Psychologically
traumatic events

21:53.346 --> 21:57.048
are overrepresented in those
afflicted with OCD, true.

21:57.050 --> 21:59.417
Especially those
with contamination obsessions

21:59.419 --> 22:01.519
and cleaning compulsions.

22:01.521 --> 22:04.555
They call it comorbid
posttraumatic stress disorder.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.860
Did you ever think
of getting help?

22:09.862 --> 22:13.497
You know, so, um...
so you could deal with it.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.032
I am dealing with it.

By slaughtering murderers

22:21.908 --> 22:24.642
and leaving souvenirs

22:24.644 --> 22:26.711
and notes at the crime scene?

22:26.713 --> 22:28.346
That's how you're dealing
with it?

22:28.348 --> 22:29.747
What about you, Alicia?

22:29.749 --> 22:32.016
How do you deal with it?

22:32.952 --> 22:34.585
You know what
I'm talking about,

22:34.587 --> 22:36.020
don't you?

22:36.022 --> 22:38.956
Sienna, your daughter.

22:39.926 --> 22:42.026
You send her to Quantico,

22:42.028 --> 22:44.795
speak at her graduation,

22:44.797 --> 22:46.831
get her a job
as a profiler,

22:46.833 --> 22:50.434
and she ends up dead
at the hands of a serial killer.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.838
No! No!

22:53.840 --> 22:56.374
You think you're safe
behind there!

Mommy, the control freak,

23:16.696 --> 23:19.730
hadn't pushed her
into the FBI.

23:19.732 --> 23:20.998

Shut up.

Your little princess

for your approval.

has a phobia

about drowning?

You order the well-done truck?

41:55.580 --> 41:57.514
She cooked this thing
pretty good.

41:57.516 --> 41:58.748
JERRY: I'm sure
insurance will cover it.

41:58.750 --> 42:00.650
I mean, you might want
to mention that you were

42:00.652 --> 42:02.752
tied up and stabbed before you
noticed the vehicle was missing.

42:02.754 --> 42:05.021
And you should probably mention
the attempted drowning.

42:05.023 --> 42:06.789
Your agent will know
what to say.

42:06.791 --> 42:09.292
I can't tell if you're
joking or serious.

42:09.294 --> 42:10.760
Absolutely serious.

42:10.762 --> 42:12.695
This is a fileable claim.

42:16.101 --> 42:18.201
All right, so she
drives my truck out here,

42:18.203 --> 42:20.603
she torches it--
then what?

42:20.605 --> 42:23.039
She disappears.
Did she have help?

42:23.041 --> 42:25.174
I don't know, there's
no tracks leading out of here,

42:25.176 --> 42:26.776
so the only way out
of here for her is

42:26.778 --> 42:28.077
either on foot,
maybe she hitchhikes.

42:28.079 --> 42:29.746
Either way, she couldn't
have gotten far.

42:29.748 --> 42:32.782
We'll find her.

42:32.784 --> 42:35.184
No, she's gone.

42:35.186 --> 42:36.920
We'll never find her.

42:36.922 --> 42:38.955
(jazz playing)

42:53.672 --> 42:55.939
Nancy?
You must be Desmond.

42:55.941 --> 42:58.107
Great to meet you. I've been
looking forward to this.

42:58.109 --> 42:59.609
Well, when you wrote
on your profile

42:59.611 --> 43:01.678
that your favorite fairy
tale is Jack the Ripper,

43:01.680 --> 43:03.947
I knew immediately that was
a woman I<i> had</i> to meet.

43:03.949 --> 43:05.014
(laughing)
