23:13.427 --> 23:15.427
Is that a prerequisite for fighters?

23:15.428 --> 23:18.230
- What's that?
- Pain, suffering.

23:18.231 --> 23:19.565
A massive cut like that,

23:19.566 --> 23:21.433
that's basically a form
of self-punishment.

23:21.434 --> 23:24.236
Yeah, well, you know, it's
also a form of weight loss.

23:24.237 --> 23:25.971
Right, Mario?

23:25.972 --> 23:27.439
Why do you fight, Jay?

23:27.440 --> 23:32.244
I fight because it comes natural
to me, and I'm good at it.

23:32.245 --> 23:34.781
You're being glib.

23:37.984 --> 23:40.385

23:40.386 --> 23:43.188

but you're right.

23:43.189 --> 23:44.924
There's not a fighter I
don't know who doesn't have

23:45.058 --> 23:47.059
some sort of deep, personal trauma.

23:47.060 --> 23:48.260
And in your case, um,

23:48.261 --> 23:50.663
I assume you're talking
about your mother.

23:52.398 --> 23:55.200
I'm not talking about
anything specifically.

23:55.201 --> 23:57.069
I understand she left the family.

23:57.070 --> 23:58.270
She's a heroin addict.

23:58.271 --> 24:00.272
We're not talking about that right now.

24:00.273 --> 24:03.075
There's these rumors that
she was a sex worker.

24:03.076 --> 24:04.276
We're not gonna get into that.

24:04.277 --> 24:07.346
All right, well...
How has it shaped your life?

24:07.347 --> 24:09.749
What's your relationship with her now?

24:14.420 --> 24:17.089
I want you to cut that question.

24:17.090 --> 24:19.626
- Why?
- Just skip it.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.561
- It's a valid question.
- Skip the question or cut the camera.

24:22.562 --> 24:24.163
- Jay, it's a valid question.
- Cut the fucking camera.

24:24.297 --> 24:25.497
It's a valid question.

24:25.498 --> 24:27.499
- Fucking valid question?
- Jay, it's a valid question.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.967
Valid question? How long
have you had that question

24:28.968 --> 24:30.302
in your fucking chamber, huh?

24:30.303 --> 24:31.504
Have you just been sitting
on that one all day?

24:31.638 --> 24:33.105
Yeah, I have. We haven't gotten
to that part of the interview.

24:33.106 --> 24:34.306
Can you turn the fucking camera off?

24:34.307 --> 24:35.907
- All right, Jay.
- Turn the fucking camera off.

24:35.908 --> 24:37.228
You don't have to be a
dick about it, all right?

24:37.230 --> 24:38.452
I'm not being a dick about it.

24:38.454 --> 24:39.778
You turn this fucking camera off,
and I think this interview is over.

24:39.779 --> 24:42.314
- You know what? Why don't you get the fuck out of my house?
- This is what you agreed to. Don't touch the equipment.

24:42.315 --> 24:44.050
I agreed to a fucking interview

24:44.183 --> 24:45.385
about my fight, not about my family.

24:45.518 --> 24:48.053
- Can you not touch the equipment?
- Interview's over. Thank you.

24:48.054 --> 24:50.055

24:50.056 --> 24:55.260

knew it was fucking bad.

25:13.279 --> 25:16.082
I thought something happened to her.

25:16.215 --> 25:20.218
Oh, man,
I'm-- I'm sorry.

25:20.219 --> 25:23.021
That's terrible.
Yeah.

25:26.492 --> 25:28.494
She wasn't feeling good,
so they--

25:28.628 --> 25:30.896
Bad enough that they took
her to the hospital.

25:30.897 --> 25:32.899
And, uh...

25:34.901 --> 25:38.103
No heartbeat, you know?

25:44.110 --> 25:45.177

25:45.178 --> 25:48.113
No. You haven't
talked to her.

25:48.114 --> 25:49.981
No, her father said she
doesn't want to hear from me.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.183
You know, I...

25:51.184 --> 25:54.252
I'm not gonna press it.

25:54.253 --> 25:56.121
No, man.
You know what they say, right?

25:56.122 --> 25:58.123
Time heals all.

25:58.124 --> 26:03.061
She probably needs some time
to get herself together.

26:03.062 --> 26:05.330
Just give her a few days.

26:05.331 --> 26:07.867

It happened with me and my
ex after the first kid.

26:23.082 --> 26:26.418
And I tried to tell her,
"Look, there's no reason."

26:26.419 --> 26:29.088
There's nothing that
either one of you did.

Ryan, stop, man.

46:22.414 --> 46:25.082
Heading home, boys.
Great party, though.

46:25.083 --> 46:26.951
Hey.

46:26.952 --> 46:29.087
You walking me to my car?

46:29.220 --> 46:31.088
What a fine group of gentlemen.

46:31.089 --> 46:32.289
- We'll get you a ride, dude.
- No, no.

46:32.290 --> 46:35.225
I'm all set, Nate.

46:35.226 --> 46:37.361
Thank you, though.
I'm good.

Hey. Yeah,
you're not driving.

- [Keys jingle]
- Stop.

46:41.099 --> 46:42.967
What the fuck are you gonna do about it?

All right, relax.

Hey, hey.
I'm fucking sick of you, man.

46:48.974 --> 46:51.375
Sick of all these fucking suits

46:51.376 --> 46:53.110

Your whole fucking routine, man.

It's old.
I'm sorry.

46:57.515 --> 46:59.784
I didn't know it was bothering you.

46:59.918 --> 47:02.454
Really?

47:02.587 --> 47:06.323
You know, you've been punking
me out to the press.

47:06.324 --> 47:09.928
- I think that's in your head, Ryan.
- No, no, no.

47:17.135 --> 47:19.269
Say something now.

47:19.270 --> 47:22.874
Go ahead. Be Jay.

Okay.

47:31.282 --> 47:32.349
You're fucking quiet now.

47:32.350 --> 47:33.417
All right, both of you stop.

47:33.418 --> 47:35.153
All right, come on.
Let me drive you--
