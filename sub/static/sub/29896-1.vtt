(soft boom)

00:17.785 --> 00:23.122
(ghostly whisperings)
(eerie music)

00:41.776 --> 00:46.745
(slow, somber music)

01:07.835 --> 01:10.636
(soft boom)

01:12.573 --> 01:15.641
(thunder rumbling)

01:17.445 --> 01:20.212
(soft boom)

01:23.517 --> 01:26.652
(slow, tense music)

01:35.096 --> 01:38.464
(gentle, somber music)

02:03.524 --> 02:07.860
Journal entry, October 13, 1995.

02:09.663 --> 02:13.265
All of my research has
led me to this day.

02:14.268 --> 02:17.669
The sound events are not
uniformly spread out,

02:17.671 --> 02:19.571
but my Tesla theories
have given me

02:19.573 --> 02:21.573
a reasonably
accurate time table.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.411
There'll be increased solar
activity in the next few days,

02:26.413 --> 02:29.648
which should be powerful
enough for what I need.

02:33.654 --> 02:37.289
It's ironic that the
ancient science I'm using

02:37.291 --> 02:40.159
is viewed so skeptically,

02:40.161 --> 02:43.762
since it's infinitely more
powerful than today's science.

02:48.169 --> 02:51.637
The worst part of this is
that I know that all the time

02:51.639 --> 02:54.573
that I'm spending
away is very painful

02:54.575 --> 02:58.911
for my daughter Paula, but
I don't see any other way.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.948
Hopefully I'll find
what I'm looking for

03:04.318 --> 03:05.884
and be home soon.

03:06.954 --> 03:10.322
(eerie voices)

03:13.360 --> 03:18.497

03:32.346 --> 03:35.881

04:02.509 --> 04:04.676
(soft whoosh)

04:04.678 --> 04:08.413
(light, mysterious music)

04:27.768 --> 04:29.735
I've spent ages going
over my dad's work

04:29.737 --> 04:30.936
since he disappeared.

04:32.539 --> 04:34.539
All the far-out, crazy theories.

04:36.477 --> 04:39.645
And now, I have just
one last thing to do.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.516
I'm going back to the one place

04:44.518 --> 04:48.020
I swore I'd never
return to, my hometown.

04:49.023 --> 04:53.058
Shasta, California --
'land of the weird'.

04:53.060 --> 04:56.328
(thunder rumbling)

04:57.531 --> 05:00.732
(slow, ominous music)

05:12.579 --> 05:15.614
(thunder rumbling)

05:20.888 --> 05:25.991
(Mysterious Horn Sound)

05:39.406 --> 05:41.340
- Well hey, can I help ya?

05:41.342 --> 05:42.341
(buzz of insect)

05:43.510 --> 05:46.044
(tense music)

05:48.482 --> 05:50.482
- Can I help ya?

05:50.484 --> 05:52.484
(static crackles)

05:52.486 --> 05:55.020
(eerie whispering)

05:57.391 --> 05:58.390
Lori.

05:59.093 --> 06:00.025
Honey.

06:00.027 --> 06:04.930
Honey, come here, come
here quick, come here!

06:04.932 --> 06:06.898
(tense, scary music)

06:06.900 --> 06:07.999
Lori!

06:08.001 --> 06:11.370
(tense, scary music)

06:14.408 --> 06:16.908
¶ Strip off the ends of me ¶

06:16.910 --> 06:19.911
¶ Where I'm calloused ¶

06:19.913 --> 06:24.516
¶ Come on look inside ¶

06:24.518 --> 06:26.952
¶ Reach in ¶

06:26.954 --> 06:28.954
¶ Find a piece of me ¶

06:28.956 --> 06:34.092
¶ Hold on, pull till I unwind ¶

06:34.661 --> 06:37.396
¶ Turn me ¶

06:37.398 --> 06:39.598
¶ From the tip of my tongue ¶

06:39.600 --> 06:44.136
¶ Unravel me, make me unravel ¶

06:44.138 --> 06:47.539
¶ Turn me ¶

06:47.541 --> 06:49.941
¶ Upside down ¶

06:49.943 --> 06:53.912
¶ Spread me out until I come ¶

06:53.914 --> 06:55.147
¶ Undone ¶

06:55.149 --> 07:00.419
(thunder rumbling)

07:04.892 --> 07:06.392
(radio static buzzing)

07:06.393 --> 07:07.893
- This is Baker, show me
10-10 at Miller's Road

07:07.895 --> 07:10.429
and Wood's Creek Line
by the snowplow shed.

07:10.431 --> 07:11.830
- [Radio Dispatcher]
Careful out there, Sheriff.

07:11.832 --> 07:12.964
- Copy that.

07:15.569 --> 07:18.637
(thunder rumbling)

07:28.182 --> 07:32.984
(car approaching)

07:35.589 --> 07:40.725
(song plays on radio)

07:50.037 --> 07:52.737
Checking to make sure you
weren't followed by Bigfoot?

07:52.739 --> 07:55.607
- Nice to see you - 'Pig'.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.376
(laughing)
- I was just about

07:57.377 --> 07:59.144
to write you a note,
good to see you, Paula.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.480
- [Paula] Good to be
here, Sheriff Sam.

08:01.482 --> 08:04.015
- Yeah well, Unibomber called
and wants his clothes back.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.585
- (laughing) No
one knows, right?

08:06.587 --> 08:08.119
- Nope.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.120
And here.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.758
Somebody at the newspaper
found this in the archives.

08:14.561 --> 08:16.094
(thunder rumbling)

08:16.095 --> 08:17.628
- [Paula] Hardly
ever saw him smile.

08:18.732 --> 08:19.898
(Mysterious Horn
Sound - distant)

08:19.900 --> 08:20.899
Thanks.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.637
How often?

08:25.638 --> 08:27.538
- Every four to six
hours, and getting closer.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.642
- So what's been happening?

08:30.644 --> 08:33.712
- Folks are scared, say
they're seeing things.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.964
- What do you mean?

08:35.965 --> 08:38.215
- It's complicated, I'll
save it for the walk.

08:39.919 --> 08:43.655
Thank you for giving me a hand.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.156
I've just been grasping
at straws here,

08:45.158 --> 08:47.058
so I really appreciate your--

08:47.060 --> 08:49.661
- Bringing the whole
airy-fairy approach to this?

08:49.663 --> 08:50.929
(laughing)

08:50.931 --> 08:52.731
- Yeah well, you know the town.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.299
Half of them in yoga
pants on cloud nine,

08:54.301 --> 08:56.868
the other half
loading their guns.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.820
They need to rule out cloud nine

08:58.821 --> 09:00.771
and get everyone
thinking logically again.

09:02.109 --> 09:07.045
(car approaches)
(upbeat music on radio)

09:07.047 --> 09:10.048
¶ ...shake me to my core... ¶

09:10.050 --> 09:12.250
- Look, before you say
anything, don't blame Sam

09:12.252 --> 09:14.553
because she told me not to come.

09:14.555 --> 09:15.887
But I had to see
you, I just had to.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.956
- I blurted something.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.024
- Paula, what happened?

09:19.026 --> 09:20.659
You just left, and I'm sorry

09:20.661 --> 09:22.694
but that was really hard for me.

09:22.696 --> 09:23.695
So I had to see you.

09:23.697 --> 09:24.763
- Meredith--

09:24.764 --> 09:25.830
- What're you doing here?

09:26.667 --> 09:27.699
Seriously?

09:29.169 --> 09:31.937
(horn honking)

09:31.939 --> 09:34.573
Don't look at me, I didn't
tell anyone, really.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.043
- Paula?

09:39.580 --> 09:41.091
Someone told me you were dead.

09:41.092 --> 09:42.603
- Charlie, how did
you know we were here?

09:42.604 --> 09:44.115
- I saw Meredith drive
by and I followed her.

09:44.117 --> 09:45.642
- You what?

09:45.643 --> 09:47.168
- What, who comes
out here anymore?

09:47.169 --> 09:48.694
Everyone thinks this
place is haunted.

09:48.695 --> 09:50.220
It looked weird, and
yeah, I was worried,

09:50.223 --> 09:51.289
so I followed you.

09:51.290 --> 09:52.356
Why didn't someone tell me?

09:52.359 --> 09:54.159
- I swear to god, this town.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.360
- Paula.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.212
- Look, we'll take off

09:57.213 --> 09:59.063
and maybe we can hang out later.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.732
- Yeah, let's all go to Dino's.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.167
- No, Charlie, you
can come by the house

10:02.169 --> 10:03.585
later if you want.

10:03.586 --> 10:05.002
- How could you just shut
out your friends like that?

10:05.005 --> 10:06.338
It's been 10 years.

10:06.340 --> 10:07.339
- 12.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.241
- Really harsh, Paula.

10:11.011 --> 10:12.143
What happened?

10:14.948 --> 10:17.148
- Anyway, we
intruded, we're sorry,

10:17.150 --> 10:20.051
and we'll get out of here.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.536
Right, Charlie?

10:21.537 --> 10:23.020
- What, why, no,
we just got here!

10:23.023 --> 10:24.990
(rhythmic horn beeping)

10:24.992 --> 10:26.124
- [Radio Host] Welcome back to

10:26.126 --> 10:29.010
"True Tales From the Darkness."

10:29.011 --> 10:31.895
Our next story, a bizarre
tale of true identity theft.

10:31.898 --> 10:32.964
Here's Rick Mos (cutoff).

10:36.036 --> 10:37.586
- [Charlie] Alicia?

10:37.587 --> 10:39.137
- Is she doing the
pose from her TV show?

10:39.139 --> 10:41.223
- [Meredith] Kill me now.

10:41.224 --> 10:43.308
- Alicia Garcia, it
is so good to see you.

10:43.310 --> 10:46.177
Your new show is amazing,
I've seen them all.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.913
What're you doing here?

10:47.914 --> 10:49.648
- She's been listening
to the police band again.

10:49.650 --> 10:52.117
- Cops have to check in and
you gave your exact location.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.718
- Who are you working for now?

10:53.720 --> 10:55.687
That 'Alien' whatever show?

10:55.689 --> 10:57.355
Or have you moved
straight on to porn?

10:57.357 --> 10:58.356
- [Sam] Yeah, now
that you've been fired

10:58.357 --> 10:59.356
by how many networks?

10:59.359 --> 11:01.059
- Lawsuits are expensive, huh?

11:01.061 --> 11:02.927
What are you blogging now?

11:02.929 --> 11:04.829
- Vlogging, I'm self-funded.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.965
- So cute.

11:06.966 --> 11:09.100
- I have 12 million
followers and I do just fine.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.269
But you wouldn't
understand that, would you.

11:11.271 --> 11:14.773
Paula - my research team
told me I'd find you here.

11:14.775 --> 11:17.108
- Nice to see you, Alicia,

11:17.110 --> 11:19.210
drive safely on your
way back to Hades.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.812
- Yeah, if you came
for another expose,

11:20.814 --> 11:22.431
you're gonna have to
turn right back around.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.049
- [Alicia] I came for something
more important than that.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.884
- Which is?

11:27.921 --> 11:30.121
You're learning to
color inside the lines?

11:30.123 --> 11:32.824
- You know, I've just
been following this
'Sound' phenomenon

11:32.826 --> 11:34.359
all over the world,
and who'd have thought

11:34.361 --> 11:36.311
that it would
bring me right back

11:36.312 --> 11:38.262
to my cute little
hometown of Mount Shasta?

11:38.265 --> 11:40.965
Home of - 'The Shasta Triangle'.

11:40.967 --> 11:42.434
Has a nice ring to
it, right? (giggling)

11:42.436 --> 11:44.703
- I've heard you've met Shatner.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.971
What is the strangest thing
you've seen with your own eyes?

11:46.973 --> 11:48.406
- Come on Charlie,

11:48.407 --> 11:49.840
she's just here because
she wants something.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.476
What is it, Alicia?

11:51.477 --> 11:53.110
- You know, quite a
coincidence Paula,

11:53.113 --> 11:54.979
showing up exactly
23 years to the day

11:54.981 --> 11:56.715
that your Dad disappeared.

11:56.717 --> 11:59.350
Yeah, I checked, and word
on the street is that DARPA

11:59.352 --> 12:01.753
didn't manage to get all of
your Daddy's research years ago.

12:01.755 --> 12:04.255
- I thought you said your
Dad didn't work for DARPA.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.124
- Wait, what's DARPA again?

12:07.094 --> 12:08.944
- It's the Pentagon's
secret think tank.

12:08.945 --> 12:10.795
Their science is 20 to 30
years ahead of everything else.

12:10.797 --> 12:13.765
They created the Stealth Bomber,
facial recognition, drones.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.400
- Yeah, they didn't
have time for cancer,

12:15.402 --> 12:17.202
climate change, world hunger.

12:17.204 --> 12:19.971
- Anyway, there's a bunch of
data missing from this book

12:19.973 --> 12:21.840
on meridian grids, timetables,

12:21.842 --> 12:24.443
gravitational wave applications,

12:24.444 --> 12:27.045
some Einstein-Tesla theory that
Paula's Daddy had combined.

12:27.047 --> 12:29.748
Egypt and Atlantis stuff,
Carlos Castaneda, but

12:29.750 --> 12:33.284
(chuckling) a lot of it is
in some ridiculous 'code'.

12:33.286 --> 12:36.354
This 'code' seems to have
some sort of connection

12:36.356 --> 12:40.391
to the 'Sound' phenomenon but
it's impossible to figure out.

12:40.393 --> 12:43.862
And there's this strange
cryptic 'timetable'.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.397
Lay lines, hotspots.

12:46.399 --> 12:49.033
These sacred places, Charlie,

12:49.035 --> 12:51.970
are located where so-called
meridians cross, 'power points'.

12:51.972 --> 12:54.773
And there's one right
here in Mount Shasta.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.297
Isn't that right, Paula?

12:56.298 --> 12:57.820
- Anyone with Google
can find that.

12:57.821 --> 12:59.343
- And my source at DARPA
tells me that Paula's Dad

12:59.346 --> 13:00.912
figured out a way to
combine these theories

13:00.914 --> 13:03.314
and do some incredible things.

13:04.785 --> 13:08.386
Look, I'm trying to be
nice here Paula but,

13:09.389 --> 13:10.855
it's taking me forever
to put this all together

13:10.857 --> 13:12.524
and I just want some answers.

13:12.526 --> 13:14.058
- Well, let me just
drop everything

13:14.060 --> 13:16.161
and help you, your highness.

13:16.162 --> 13:18.263
- (scoffing) Come on, I
have been all over the world

13:18.265 --> 13:20.399
with this data with
some of the best minds,

13:20.400 --> 13:22.534
spent a ton of money, and
nobody can break this code.

13:22.536 --> 13:24.903
You could probably unlock
this whole thing in an hour.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.337
- I don't have an hour.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.539
And I don't know how
to tell you this but--

13:27.541 --> 13:29.107
- It's time you are going.

13:29.943 --> 13:32.210
- No, no, I'm not leaving.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.212
- Yes, you are.

13:34.213 --> 13:36.213
- Paula, give me one
good reason why not.

13:37.117 --> 13:39.584
- Your book - is a fake.

13:43.089 --> 13:46.224
- No, I know my source
is completely legit.

13:48.361 --> 13:49.360
Okay.

13:51.498 --> 13:55.233
Okay.  Paula - here's my offer.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.969
I'll give you $25,000
of my own money

13:57.971 --> 14:01.072
to decode and explain
this book on my show.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.974
I'll black out your
face, warble your voice,

14:02.976 --> 14:04.375
change your name, whatever.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.212
- No.

14:11.585 --> 14:13.368
- No, why not?

14:13.369 --> 14:15.152
100K, in cash, that's
everything I have, vulture.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.556
This is a valuable opportunity
and I'm willing to go all in.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.024
- Why should I help you?

14:20.026 --> 14:22.493
I came here to do
something with Sam.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.863
I don't need you,
or your fake book.

14:25.532 --> 14:26.931
I don't even want your money.

14:26.933 --> 14:29.033
- Oh please, take all her money.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.902
- And embarrass her while
you're at it if you can.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.537
- [Charlie] Come on you
guys, why not help her out?

14:32.539 --> 14:34.222
- Thank you, Charlie.

14:34.223 --> 14:35.906
This could answer some
real questions for you.

14:35.909 --> 14:38.610
- And, make you a lot
of money on your show.

14:38.612 --> 14:41.096
- And put you back on the map.

14:41.097 --> 14:43.581
- Doing what you do best,
ruining decent people's lives.

14:43.583 --> 14:47.018
- Look, I'm completely
fascinated by all of this,

14:47.020 --> 14:49.520
just like you, and I wanna
know how it all works

14:49.522 --> 14:51.155
and share it with the world.

14:52.959 --> 14:54.492
I can just follow you, you know.

14:54.493 --> 14:56.026
This is public land,
you can't stop me.

14:56.029 --> 14:58.313
- We would get to
make fun of her,

14:58.314 --> 15:00.598
and it would give us someone
our findings - publicly.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.570
- No, I don't have
time for this so,

15:05.572 --> 15:07.906
the price is 150,000.

15:07.908 --> 15:10.174
And I'll split it with
Meredith, Sam, and Charlie.

15:10.176 --> 15:11.609
- What, that's outrageous?

15:11.611 --> 15:12.911
- [Sam] Paula, you
don't have to do that.

15:12.913 --> 15:13.912
- 150,000.

15:19.052 --> 15:24.188
- Okay, 120K, it's a
nice, even number, good?

15:25.325 --> 15:27.091
Great, it's settled.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.660
And since you're
all taking my money,

15:28.662 --> 15:30.261
you'll all be my witnesses.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.113
We'll go and do whatever it is

15:32.114 --> 15:33.964
that Paula and Sam are
here to do, together.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.334
- When we come back out, Alicia,

15:36.336 --> 15:38.469
you can have a full,
exclusive, on-camera interview

15:38.471 --> 15:41.239
with me and everyone
else, if they want.

15:41.241 --> 15:42.974
And we all get paid.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.160
- And you'll explain
the notebook.

15:45.161 --> 15:47.345
- I'll decode, explain
the setups, you name it.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.069
All on camera.

15:49.070 --> 15:50.792
- [Charlie] Come on, we
grew up in these woods.

15:50.793 --> 15:52.515
Grab some warm stuff from
your car and let's go!

15:53.353 --> 15:57.655
(slow, solemn music)

16:01.361 --> 16:04.028
- [Paula] Leave your phones
and cameras in your car.

16:04.030 --> 16:05.763
- What, you can't do that.

16:05.764 --> 16:07.497
- Do what, the deal was to
be interviewed for your show

16:07.500 --> 16:09.200
'after' our time in the woods.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.368
I didn't say you
could record it.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.070
- Seriously!?

16:12.072 --> 16:14.105
- That's the deal.

16:14.106 --> 16:16.139
- [Meredith] Aw, and you got
yourself all camera-ready.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.176
Disconnect for a few hours.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.978
It's amazing to live
in the real world.

16:19.980 --> 16:22.547
- [Alicia] That is
such crap, come on.

16:22.549 --> 16:23.614
- [Sam] Phones
don't work out there

16:23.616 --> 16:25.249
and neither does my walkie.

16:26.987 --> 16:29.387
- What, no cavity search?

16:29.389 --> 16:31.022
Aren't you gonna leave your gun?

16:31.024 --> 16:33.257
- No, why, are you
afraid I might shoot you?

16:33.259 --> 16:35.693
I can't leave it unattended.

16:35.695 --> 16:38.663
(thunder rumbling)

16:38.665 --> 16:40.498
(slow, solemn music)

16:40.500 --> 16:43.701
(Sam laughing)

16:43.703 --> 16:47.238
(slow, haunting music)

17:11.798 --> 17:17.135
(tense music)
(soft booming)

17:27.146 --> 17:32.283
(insects swarming)
(insects buzzing)

17:34.354 --> 17:36.354
- [Alicia] Hey Paula,
where're we headed?

17:36.356 --> 17:37.722
- [Paula] The hide
and seek tree.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.090
- [Meredith] All
the way out there?

17:39.091 --> 17:40.457
- [Charlie] Hey Alicia,
how does all this

17:40.460 --> 17:42.160
science stuff work anyways?

17:42.162 --> 17:45.329
- [Alicia] Well, since
you're a true fan, Charlie,

17:45.331 --> 17:47.532
You remember that old board
game, 'Snakes and Ladders',

17:47.534 --> 17:49.600
where if you landed on the
right spot at the right time

17:49.602 --> 17:51.736
you could instantly move to
another square on the board?

17:51.738 --> 17:53.138
- [Charlie] Like where?

17:53.139 --> 17:54.539
- [Alicia] Exactly - 'where'?

17:54.541 --> 17:56.774
All of these powerful
energy meridians

17:56.776 --> 17:59.277
crisscross the Earth and
intersect at hot spots.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.545
Priests and shamans used to put

18:00.547 --> 18:02.313
big things at them
like pyramids.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.315
I think they used to
use them as portals.

18:04.317 --> 18:07.151
- [Sam] Do people actually
watch this show of yours?

18:07.153 --> 18:09.203
- [Alicia] You know,
just because I did better

18:09.204 --> 18:11.254
than the rest of you, and
made something of my life.

18:11.257 --> 18:14.392
- [Sam] Our problem is
what you made of yourself.

18:15.261 --> 18:17.095
- Things good with you now, Sam?

18:17.697 --> 18:19.297
How's Rehab goin' for ya?

18:25.872 --> 18:28.139
- You can't
blackmail me, Garcia.

18:28.141 --> 18:30.508
Everyone who matters
already knows my story.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.116
- You shouldn't make
her mad like that.

18:38.118 --> 18:39.834
- Why?

18:39.835 --> 18:41.551
- Because I've seen her
break up bar fights before.

18:44.190 --> 18:45.306
She can get nasty.

18:45.307 --> 18:46.423
- What makes you think
I can't handle myself?

18:46.426 --> 18:48.593
- [Charlie] Because you ran
from every fight at school.

18:48.595 --> 18:50.128
- [Alicia] I did not!

18:50.129 --> 18:51.662
- [Charlie] Uh, Joanie
Klumpers wanted to pound you

18:51.664 --> 18:53.464
for stealing her math homework,

18:53.465 --> 18:55.265
and you made me pick you up
at the back of the school

18:55.268 --> 18:57.401
and cover you up in the
back seat with a blanket.

18:57.403 --> 18:59.871
- You ran from Klumpers?

18:59.873 --> 19:01.639
- That is completely false.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.207
And maybe Charlie
should tell you

19:03.209 --> 19:04.542
how she made out
with Ronnie Simpson.

19:04.544 --> 19:06.010
- The 'Mathlete'?

19:06.011 --> 19:07.477
- [Meredith] Oh Charlie,
that's so cruel.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.530
- Be quiet, Alicia.

19:09.531 --> 19:11.581
- And then, there was
Tony, under the stairs.

19:11.584 --> 19:12.750
- Shut up.

19:12.751 --> 19:13.917
- The one that really
takes the cake--

19:13.920 --> 19:15.153
- [Charlie] Shut up!

19:15.155 --> 19:16.287
- [Alicia] Diane Smith.

19:16.289 --> 19:17.522
- I said, Shut up!!

19:17.524 --> 19:18.923
- Whatever happened to her?

19:21.528 --> 19:23.461
- How 'bout that abortion
that you got senior year

19:23.463 --> 19:25.429
after Alders knocked you up?

19:25.431 --> 19:26.430
- What?

19:26.431 --> 19:27.430
- The Gym teacher?

19:30.270 --> 19:33.271
- And 'boom goes the dynamite'.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.806
(Sam laughing)

19:35.808 --> 19:40.912
(slow, somber music)

19:49.222 --> 19:54.258
(light, mysterious music)

20:18.518 --> 20:21.552
- [Alicia] There it is,
The Hide and Seek Tree.

20:22.655 --> 20:25.890
(slow, solemn music)

21:13.406 --> 21:16.440
(thunder rumbling)

21:19.479 --> 21:22.947
(slow, mysterious music)

21:45.838 --> 21:48.439
Sam, can you put the
center stake here?

21:48.441 --> 21:50.875
(slow, mysterious music

21:53.880 --> 21:58.983
(pounding)

22:05.325 --> 22:07.091
(BOOM!)

22:07.093 --> 22:09.827
(eerie music)

22:11.397 --> 22:12.697
- Are we seconds away?

22:12.699 --> 22:14.098
- [Charlie] From what?

22:14.100 --> 22:15.599
- The 'Sound'.

22:15.601 --> 22:16.901
- I thought that was debunked.

22:16.903 --> 22:18.636
- None of them
have been debunked.

22:18.638 --> 22:21.872
Not the one here or in
Russia, or Ayers Rock, Egypt,

22:21.874 --> 22:22.873
none of them.

22:26.079 --> 22:31.415
(eerie music)
(static electric crackles)

22:31.884 --> 22:36.654
(Mysterious Horn)

22:39.759 --> 22:43.027
(high-pitched tonal buzzing)

22:43.029 --> 22:44.462
- That was an hour early.

22:44.464 --> 22:45.947
Is that on our time table?

22:45.948 --> 22:47.431
- Wait, what do you mean?

22:47.433 --> 22:50.067
(tense music)

22:50.069 --> 22:51.936
- I don't feel so great.

22:51.938 --> 22:54.004
- Charlie, your ears.

22:54.006 --> 22:55.539
(tense music)

22:55.541 --> 22:57.030
- [Sam] Sit.

22:57.031 --> 22:58.520
- There's something really
going on here, isn't there?

22:58.521 --> 23:00.010
- Let's look after Charlie,
then we can talk about it.

23:00.012 --> 23:01.829
Take a minute to rest.

23:01.830 --> 23:03.647
- I think I'll catch my breath
and then head back guys,

23:03.649 --> 23:05.383
I don't feel so well.

23:05.385 --> 23:06.384
- [Meredith] Are you sure?

23:06.386 --> 23:08.053
- Maybe just rest, huh?

23:08.054 --> 23:09.721
- Don't forget about the deal.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.389
If you don't stay, you don't
get your share of the money.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.508
- That wasn't part of the deal.

23:13.509 --> 23:15.626
- Hey, it's my money, and I
agreed to the terms you set,

23:15.628 --> 23:17.094
like no cameras.

23:17.096 --> 23:18.446
(tense music)

23:18.447 --> 23:19.797
- [Meredith] Why don't you
just sit here for a minute

23:19.799 --> 23:21.665
and see how you feel.

23:21.667 --> 23:25.069
- I really think I'll head
back slowly, I'll be fine.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.070
- I don't think you should.

23:26.072 --> 23:28.022
- Yeah, stay for a bit.

23:28.023 --> 23:29.973
- No, really, I, I
don't feel good here!

23:29.976 --> 23:32.143
I promise I'll be fine.

23:32.145 --> 23:34.545
I don't care about any
stupid deal, I'm leaving!

23:34.547 --> 23:35.980
I'll sleep in my car
for a bit on my way,

23:35.982 --> 23:37.515
no, leave me alone!!

23:38.818 --> 23:40.718
- [Sam] What do you think?

23:40.720 --> 23:42.553
- [Meredith] I'll go
after her in a few minutes

23:42.555 --> 23:44.688
to make sure that she made it.

23:44.690 --> 23:46.524
You know how stubborn she is.

23:46.526 --> 23:49.059
(tense music)

23:54.200 --> 23:58.469
(music increasing in intensity)

23:58.471 --> 24:03.441
(intense, mysterious music)

24:21.160 --> 24:23.561
- So what's new in
your world, Sam?

24:23.563 --> 24:26.697
- No expose for
you today, 'slick'.

24:26.699 --> 24:28.833
- What about all the bizarre
stuff happening around here.

24:28.835 --> 24:31.602
- When you're a Cop, bizarre
stuff happens all the time.

24:31.604 --> 24:34.939
- Like, people disappearing,
livestock missing

24:34.941 --> 24:36.540
and showing up where
it shouldn't be?

24:36.542 --> 24:38.609
A jail cell full of
mysterious vagrants,

24:38.611 --> 24:41.078
strange lights in the
sky, crazy looking clouds?

24:41.080 --> 24:43.013
- Sounds like just
another day in Shasta.

24:43.015 --> 24:45.749
- Messed up people end
up in jail all the time.

24:45.751 --> 24:48.118
And sometimes people
just leave town.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.787
And ask any farmer,

24:49.789 --> 24:51.822
there is no accounting
for what animals do.

24:51.824 --> 24:54.625
And the lights in the sky
are airplanes, satellites,

24:54.627 --> 24:57.528
and stars, and you can see
anything you want in a cloud.

24:57.530 --> 24:59.630
- Be honest, Garcia,
do you actually believe

24:59.632 --> 25:02.266
any of this stuff, or are
you just here to make a buck?

25:03.536 --> 25:05.903
- I know we grew up
in the land of weird,

25:05.905 --> 25:08.806
and when I started it
was just a cool job.

25:08.808 --> 25:11.141
But, I've seen too much,

25:11.143 --> 25:12.810
and I know that there's
more to our world

25:12.812 --> 25:13.911
than meets the eye.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.981
What do you think, Meredith?

25:16.983 --> 25:17.982
- I don't know.

25:19.519 --> 25:21.185
How 'bout you two?

25:21.187 --> 25:23.921
Do you actually think any of
this stuff is really possible?

25:23.923 --> 25:26.991
(Loud Thunder)

25:27.994 --> 25:30.594
- No, no, I don't
think it's possible.

25:30.596 --> 25:32.596
Everything has a
logic explanation.

25:32.598 --> 25:34.231
Sometimes it just takes
a little extra effort

25:34.233 --> 25:35.266
to figure things out.

25:35.268 --> 25:38.569
(thunder rumbling)

25:38.571 --> 25:40.571
- Then what the hell is that!?

25:40.573 --> 25:42.940
(static crackles and swirling)

25:42.942 --> 25:48.078
(tense music)
(static crackles and swirling)

25:48.848 --> 25:53.117
(static crackling and swirling)

25:53.786 --> 25:56.854
(Mysterious Horn Sound)

25:56.856 --> 25:59.023
- What's going on?

25:59.025 --> 26:02.293
- This isn't suppose
to be happening.

26:02.295 --> 26:03.894
- [Sam] Charlie.

26:04.964 --> 26:06.964
Meredith was just
gonna come get you.

26:07.733 --> 26:10.968
(eerie, tense music)

26:25.885 --> 26:28.819
It's all right, sit down
and I'll get you some water.

26:28.821 --> 26:30.821
- No, I, I, I'm, I
don't understand.

26:30.823 --> 26:31.756
I'm just gonna go...

26:31.757 --> 26:32.690
- [Meredith] I'll take her back.

26:32.691 --> 26:33.624
- Are you sure?

26:36.696 --> 26:38.729
- It's all right,
we'll take it slow.

26:38.731 --> 26:40.230
- We'll keep setting up here.

26:42.335 --> 26:47.271
(slow, mysterious music)

26:50.876 --> 26:56.013
(ghostly whispers)
(suspenseful music)

26:59.619 --> 27:01.885
- You're probably just run down.

27:01.887 --> 27:03.253
- I was walking and then--

27:03.255 --> 27:05.289
- I know how scary
these woods can be.

27:06.726 --> 27:09.026
Don't worry, Sam and I will
give you part of our share

27:09.028 --> 27:11.295
so you'll still get
some of Alicia's money.

27:13.165 --> 27:14.932
- I don't think that's Alicia.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.067
- What?

27:17.837 --> 27:19.036
- That's not her.

27:20.306 --> 27:21.806
- Wow, you must be tired.

27:21.807 --> 27:23.307
She still seems like
the same self-righteous,

27:23.309 --> 27:25.275
over-inflated jerk to me, right?

27:28.014 --> 27:29.664
- Yeah.

27:29.665 --> 27:31.315
- [Meredith] The sound
is really nuts, huh?

27:31.317 --> 27:34.752
- Reverend Jones thinks it
has to do with The End Times.

27:34.754 --> 27:36.387
- Oh, you're going
to church now.

27:37.790 --> 27:41.025
Wow, it really has been a long
time since we've hung out.

27:41.027 --> 27:42.926
And it's my fault, I'm
gonna do a better job

27:42.928 --> 27:45.262
of staying in touch
from now on, okay?

27:45.264 --> 27:49.433
You know, growing up was
really tough on Paula.

27:49.435 --> 27:51.335
- Yeah, what's with that?

27:51.337 --> 27:53.904
- She doesn't like
to talk about it but

27:53.906 --> 27:56.940
Sam told me that, though
her Mother's death

27:56.942 --> 28:00.210
was listed as a car accident,
it actually happened overseas.

28:00.212 --> 28:01.712
- Really?

28:01.713 --> 28:03.213
- [Meredith] No body
was ever recovered,

28:03.214 --> 28:04.714
so she doesn't really know
what happened to her Mom.

28:04.715 --> 28:06.215
And back in elementary school
before we were all close,

28:06.218 --> 28:08.469
her Dad used to travel a lot.

28:08.470 --> 28:10.721
She'd be left with neighbors
for weeks at a time.

28:10.723 --> 28:12.423
- Where did he travel?

28:12.425 --> 28:15.325
- Actually, a lot of those
places in Alicia's book.

28:16.696 --> 28:19.263
After her Dad disappeared,
the only silver lining

28:19.265 --> 28:22.232
if there is one is that
after bouncing around

28:22.234 --> 28:24.702
to all those foster homes
for all those years,

28:24.704 --> 28:26.370
she ended up with
Sam and her Dad.

28:27.707 --> 28:29.874
I think Sam being her big sister

28:29.875 --> 28:32.042
was really good
for both of them.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.711
- Lucky.

28:33.713 --> 28:36.113
- Yeah, lucky it turned
out as good as it did.

28:36.115 --> 28:38.849
(tense music --
ghostly whispers)

28:40.386 --> 28:41.251
- Someone's watching us.

28:41.253 --> 28:42.853
(ghostly scream)

28:42.855 --> 28:45.989
(soft boom)

28:45.991 --> 28:47.858
- Charlie, you're
freaking me out.

28:48.828 --> 28:52.096
(eerie music)

28:52.098 --> 28:55.365
(ghostly whisperings)

29:02.808 --> 29:07.945
(gentle, haunting music)
(ghostly whisperings)

29:26.899 --> 29:30.134
(slow, somber music)

29:40.479 --> 29:42.513
- Oh great, you talked
some sense into her.

29:42.515 --> 29:46.984
- (crying) No,
(crying) no, no, no.

29:46.986 --> 29:50.888
No, (crying) no, no, no, no, no.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.340
No, this can't be happening.

29:52.341 --> 29:53.791
No, this can't be happening.
- Charlie,

29:53.793 --> 29:55.058
Charlie, you're okay.
- No, no, no, no.

29:55.060 --> 29:56.113
- No.
- Look at me.

29:56.114 --> 29:57.167
- This doesn't make any sense.

29:57.168 --> 29:58.221
- Look at me, Charlie.
- No, no, no.

29:58.222 --> 29:59.275
No, no, no, no, and I
don't wanna be here.

29:59.276 --> 30:00.329
I don't wanna, I
don't wanna be here.

30:00.332 --> 30:02.277
No, I have to go the other way.

30:02.278 --> 30:04.223
- Charlie.
- What happened?

30:04.224 --> 30:06.169
- We went straight back on the
path, that's what happened.

30:06.172 --> 30:07.822
- Obviously you didn't.

30:07.823 --> 30:09.473
- [Meredith] We did, and
we came back right here.

30:09.475 --> 30:10.841
- Oh, come on?

30:10.843 --> 30:12.398
- What do you mean, "Come on?"

30:12.399 --> 30:13.954
We were walking back
towards the cars.

30:13.955 --> 30:15.510
- You used to get lost
here playing hide and seek.

30:15.514 --> 30:17.214
- I'm not playing hide and seek.

30:17.216 --> 30:19.183
I was walking back to the cars.

30:19.185 --> 30:20.701
- Okay, stop it.

30:20.702 --> 30:22.218
- I can't have you guys
screwing around here, not today.

30:22.221 --> 30:23.598
- What?

30:23.599 --> 30:24.976
- Okay, just relax.

30:24.977 --> 30:26.354
- [Meredith] Charlie and I can't
both be taking wrong turns.

30:26.358 --> 30:28.926
Either we're both
messed up or there's--

30:28.928 --> 30:30.644
- Or, it's some sort of 'force'

30:30.645 --> 30:32.361
orchestrating this whole thing,
some sort of intelligence.

30:32.364 --> 30:33.831
- You don't know what
you're talking about.

30:33.833 --> 30:35.065
- Then fill us in.

30:35.067 --> 30:36.984
What's suppose to happen?

30:36.985 --> 30:38.902
- This is just like that vortex
place up in Washington state

30:38.904 --> 30:40.037
but more powerful, right?

30:40.039 --> 30:41.205
Or it's a DARPA experiment

30:41.206 --> 30:42.372
and you're using your
Daddy's knowledge

30:42.374 --> 30:43.841
to pull off some sort of--

30:43.842 --> 30:45.309
- I don't work at
DARPA and never have

30:45.311 --> 30:46.777
so just drop that.

30:46.778 --> 30:48.244
- Paula, we need
to use our heads.

30:48.247 --> 30:50.080
Let's eliminate
some possibilities.

30:50.082 --> 30:51.537
- Agreed.

30:51.538 --> 30:52.993
- It could be a magnetic thing,

30:52.994 --> 30:54.449
it could be a part of the
path that looks similar,

30:54.453 --> 30:56.620
or just confusion.

30:56.622 --> 30:58.021
- A government experiment.

30:58.023 --> 30:59.523
- We don't have time for this.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.259
Sam, we need a good idea.

31:05.598 --> 31:10.500
(slow, tense music)

31:13.005 --> 31:18.075
(ghostly whisperings)

31:21.614 --> 31:23.981
- Paula, you stay here.

31:24.917 --> 31:25.983
- Why me?

31:25.985 --> 31:26.984
- Just trust me.

31:26.986 --> 31:30.287
Charlie, you go a different
way this time, Meredith too.

31:30.289 --> 31:33.056
Alicia and I will both go
in different directions.

31:33.058 --> 31:34.491
We'll all leave the center point

31:34.493 --> 31:37.928
in four different
directions, simultaneously.

31:37.930 --> 31:41.965
The first person back to
their car, or any car,

31:41.967 --> 31:44.935
honk the horn once
every 10 seconds.

31:44.937 --> 31:46.970
Listen for the sound of the horn

31:46.972 --> 31:48.789
and then head that direction.

31:48.790 --> 31:50.607
Once we're there, we'll
figure out what happened here.

31:50.609 --> 31:52.576
- You guys aren't messing
around here, right?

31:52.578 --> 31:54.177
- No one's messing around.

31:54.179 --> 31:56.280
- But what if it doesn't work?

31:56.281 --> 31:58.382
- It'll work, just get
ready for a beer at Dino's.

31:58.384 --> 31:59.850
I'm buying.

31:59.851 --> 32:01.317
We'll just use our heads and
we'll all figure this out

32:01.320 --> 32:02.452
together like a team, right?

32:02.454 --> 32:04.471
Paula is our anchor.

32:04.472 --> 32:06.489
We're gonna scout our
way out of here together.

32:06.492 --> 32:10.928
Just listen for the sound of
the car horn and head that way.

32:10.930 --> 32:13.196
- Great, fantastic.

32:14.066 --> 32:19.069
(deep suspenseful music)
(soft booming)

32:41.327 --> 32:46.463
- Just keep walking straight,
it's all gonna be okay.

32:47.666 --> 32:51.101
Straight ahead, it's just a
bad dream, straight ahead.

32:52.037 --> 32:54.538
(eerie music)

32:58.644 --> 33:02.512
(ghostly whisper).
(Meredith gasping)

33:04.216 --> 33:05.549
- Oh, oh, okay.

33:07.152 --> 33:12.289
(slow, suspenseful music)
(ghostly whisperings)

33:20.265 --> 33:21.999
- Keep your head on straight.

33:25.137 --> 33:30.273
(slow, suspenseful music)
(ghostly whisperings)

33:51.330 --> 33:54.598
(ghostly whisperings)

34:04.710 --> 34:08.445
(slow, suspenseful music)

34:19.792 --> 34:20.791
- Hello?

34:23.195 --> 34:24.261
Guys?

34:26.465 --> 34:27.563
Sam?

34:29.168 --> 34:32.302
(slow, tense music)

34:52.491 --> 34:56.193
- I'm sorry Paula, I
tried, I really did.

34:57.096 --> 34:58.361
- [Paula] Did you turn around?

34:58.363 --> 35:00.113
- What?

35:00.114 --> 35:01.864
No, I, I kept walking
straight, I promise.

35:03.368 --> 35:04.568
What, no car horns?

35:04.570 --> 35:07.504
- Dammit, any car horns?

35:07.506 --> 35:09.606
I kept straight the whole way

35:09.607 --> 35:11.707
and by all rights I
should be way over there.

35:13.479 --> 35:14.344
What?

35:14.346 --> 35:15.645
- Not you too.

35:15.647 --> 35:16.913
- What?

35:16.914 --> 35:18.180
- I can't believe this!

35:19.218 --> 35:21.351
- Paula, I don't know
what to say, except--

35:21.353 --> 35:22.452
- What?

35:22.454 --> 35:27.591
I, I, I, this is, I, Paula.

35:28.627 --> 35:30.010
- [Charlie] No this
can't be happening.

35:30.011 --> 35:31.394
What is going on here?

35:31.395 --> 35:32.778
- So this is for
real now, right?

35:32.779 --> 35:34.162
We're in some sort
of a, a vortex.

35:34.166 --> 35:37.167
- How do I know that this
isn't some big stunt?

35:37.169 --> 35:38.362
- What?

35:38.363 --> 35:39.556
- That doesn't even make sense.

35:39.557 --> 35:40.750
- Well neither does this.

35:40.751 --> 35:41.944
- If you think we're
playing a joke here,

35:41.945 --> 35:43.138
you are out of your mind.

35:43.142 --> 35:45.375
This is me, Sam.

35:46.545 --> 35:49.880
This is what we came here to
figure out, one way or another.

35:51.450 --> 35:52.415
Right?

35:53.452 --> 35:56.586
(slow, tense music)

36:01.727 --> 36:02.626
Paula, wait!

36:02.628 --> 36:05.695
(adventurous music)

36:05.697 --> 36:06.696
Paula!

36:09.535 --> 36:11.168
Paula!

36:11.170 --> 36:13.904
(dramatic music)

36:14.806 --> 36:15.805
- No!

36:22.848 --> 36:23.847
- Paula.

36:26.185 --> 36:28.285
- This can't be right, can it?
- It's okay.

36:28.287 --> 36:29.886
Something's happening
and we're gonna

36:29.888 --> 36:31.744
get to the bottom of it.

36:31.745 --> 36:33.601
- [Paula] There has
to be an explanation.

36:33.602 --> 36:35.458
- [Sam] We'll get
to the bottom of it.

36:37.829 --> 36:39.763
- Okay, cough it up.

36:39.765 --> 36:41.698
What did you come out here
to do, what is all this?

36:41.700 --> 36:43.433
I'm paying for this
party and I want answers.

36:43.435 --> 36:45.468
- You knew this
could happen, Paula.

36:50.409 --> 36:51.608
- I don't think she did.

36:51.610 --> 36:52.609
- That's true.

36:52.611 --> 36:55.412
I came out here to
prove all of this wrong.

36:55.414 --> 36:56.758
- And we will.

36:56.759 --> 36:58.103
- [Meredith] Come on, now what?

36:58.104 --> 36:59.448
- There wasn't suppose
to be a 'now what'.

36:59.451 --> 37:02.485
(Loud Thunder)

37:03.455 --> 37:05.355
- But there is,
and now Paula knows

37:05.357 --> 37:07.891
I was right and she was wrong.

37:07.893 --> 37:11.228
And I'd say she's highly
motivated to figure it out.

37:11.230 --> 37:13.763
(eerie music)

37:16.702 --> 37:19.703
(static electric sparkles)

37:19.705 --> 37:21.571
(whoosh)

37:21.573 --> 37:24.641
(static electric
sparkles swirling)

37:24.643 --> 37:29.379
(static electric
sparkles swirling)

37:29.381 --> 37:34.517
(Mysterious Horn Sound)

37:34.987 --> 37:39.522
(Mysterious Horn Sound)

37:44.029 --> 37:45.462
- Charlie?

37:45.463 --> 37:46.896
(light buzzing)

37:48.400 --> 37:50.367
- [Alicia] Charlie!?

37:52.771 --> 37:53.770
Charlie!?

37:54.873 --> 37:57.941
- Okay, we need the whole story.

38:02.814 --> 38:04.314
- Just tell them, Paula.

38:06.551 --> 38:09.419
(Paula sighing)

38:11.056 --> 38:14.924
- [Alicia] Paula, your
ears are bleeding too.

38:16.595 --> 38:17.661
- Okay, um,

38:19.064 --> 38:24.034
the day my Dad went missing,
he had a talk with me.

38:25.804 --> 38:28.972
Even at 7, I knew
this day was weird.

38:30.342 --> 38:33.310
He said he had to go, which
you know, was upsetting

38:33.312 --> 38:36.379
because it was
happening so often.

38:36.381 --> 38:39.716
My Dad and I, we used to
camp out here sometimes.

38:39.718 --> 38:42.452
He taught me how to use
the coat hanger here,

38:42.454 --> 38:46.456
some survival
stuff, and his code.

38:46.458 --> 38:50.593
Before he left, he gave me the
Notebook to keep it secret.

38:50.595 --> 38:53.029
So I put it in my
jacket to hide later.

38:53.031 --> 38:57.600
But when he left, I was upset
and I followed him on my bike.

38:59.071 --> 39:01.571
And I never saw him again.

39:03.342 --> 39:07.977
- So, he disappeared,
like Charlie just did?

39:07.979 --> 39:10.747
- Paula and I have been in
contact for a few months now.

39:10.749 --> 39:12.882
I reached out to her
for a number of reasons.

39:12.884 --> 39:14.617
- And you didn't tell me?

39:14.619 --> 39:17.237
- Paula is a private person.

39:17.238 --> 39:19.856
And, around then, a lot of
strange things were happening.

39:19.858 --> 39:22.559
I was getting a ton of calls.

39:22.561 --> 39:24.094
While I was trying
to figure that out,

39:24.096 --> 39:26.830
Paula was trying to sort
things out with her past.

39:27.733 --> 39:28.898
- Yeah.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.033
I saw a shrink.

39:30.035 --> 39:34.437
I was trying to come to
terms with my dad being gone.

39:35.407 --> 39:38.575
I was deep in the rabbit
hole, hallucinating,

39:38.577 --> 39:40.643
believing things were
happening that weren't.

39:40.645 --> 39:42.579
It took years to
work through it all.

39:42.581 --> 39:44.681
- By the time we reconnected,
Paula wasn't so sure

39:44.683 --> 39:47.617
of the brilliance of her dad,
and decided to come back here,

39:47.619 --> 39:49.919
face her fears where
she last saw him.

39:49.921 --> 39:52.055
- And the 'Sound' had
something to do with it?

39:53.392 --> 39:57.594
- Yeah, when it hit,
I fell off my bike.

39:57.596 --> 40:00.347
- Here?

40:00.348 --> 40:03.099
- Yeah, I, I must've bumped
my head and when I came to

40:03.101 --> 40:05.135
my Dad wasn't around.

40:05.137 --> 40:07.470
- And you brought us here?

40:07.472 --> 40:09.973
And now we're stuck
and Charlie's gone!

40:09.975 --> 40:12.041
- We came out here
to debunk this

40:12.043 --> 40:14.077
so that Paula could
get on with her life.

40:14.079 --> 40:17.814
It wasn't her idea to have
anyone else come along.

40:17.816 --> 40:20.450
- I knew if I followed all of
his directions to the letter

40:20.452 --> 40:23.086
and nothing happened,
I would know for sure

40:23.088 --> 40:24.821
that this is all a fantasy.

40:25.991 --> 40:27.924
The delusions of the crazy
Dad who abandoned me.

40:27.926 --> 40:30.026
- But now we know it's not.

40:30.028 --> 40:32.095
- How could I have known that?

40:32.097 --> 40:33.963
I'd rather believe
that he was some jerk

40:33.965 --> 40:36.433
who took off on his
daughter than believe

40:36.435 --> 40:38.502
whatever 'this' is.

40:38.503 --> 40:40.570
You have to be crazy to
believe this is true.

40:40.572 --> 40:41.571
- Or me.

40:43.074 --> 40:45.708
- The point is, Paula
got specific information

40:45.710 --> 40:47.444
from deciphering
her Dad's Notebook.

40:47.446 --> 40:50.163
- [Paula] The real book.

40:50.164 --> 40:52.881
- Today's date, this location,
and a rough timetable.

40:52.884 --> 40:54.217
- [Paula] Where did you
get your Notebook anyway?

40:54.219 --> 40:56.453
- My contact at
DARPA who told me

40:56.455 --> 40:58.588
that it belonged to your Dad,

40:58.589 --> 41:00.722
who gave it to him 23 years
ago, before he disappeared.

41:00.725 --> 41:02.192
- Well, let's take
a look at both books

41:02.194 --> 41:04.227
and see what they can teach us.

41:04.229 --> 41:05.929
Maybe there's a
breakthrough in them.

41:05.931 --> 41:10.867
(Loud Thunder)

41:10.869 --> 41:16.005
(tense music)

41:16.875 --> 41:21.845
(Mysterious Horn Sound)

41:21.847 --> 41:26.883
(Mysterious Horn Sound)

41:30.155 --> 41:35.492
(soft buzzing)

41:38.864 --> 41:41.531
- You brought us
out here to die.

41:41.533 --> 41:46.636
(ghostly whisperings)
(static buzzing)

41:49.641 --> 41:54.143
(gentle, somber music)

42:07.058 --> 42:08.057
- Huh.

42:09.594 --> 42:10.894
- [Sam] What?

42:10.895 --> 42:12.195
- It isn't exactly a fake.

42:12.197 --> 42:14.664
We can fill in some of
each other's blanks.

42:15.567 --> 42:19.202
(light, suspenseful music)

42:22.741 --> 42:24.674
- [Sam] Is this a
map of our setup?

42:25.844 --> 42:27.744
- So what do we do with this?

42:27.746 --> 42:29.746
- [Paula] I'll decode
it all to be sure.

42:29.748 --> 42:31.047
- [Alicia] Just in case.

42:32.851 --> 42:34.751
- Can you grab
mine out of my bag?

42:36.254 --> 42:37.253
Thanks.

42:39.190 --> 42:40.557
- [Sam] What is this?

42:41.726 --> 42:42.725
- Alpha.

42:44.629 --> 42:45.595
Omega.

42:46.565 --> 42:47.864
And that one's Etnane.

42:48.733 --> 42:50.733
The Eye of Horus is down there.

42:51.803 --> 42:56.806
It says here, that the
'Sound' is created by

42:57.976 --> 43:00.043
expanding and contracting
gravitational waves

43:00.045 --> 43:02.045
passing through us.

43:02.047 --> 43:04.948
Time speeds up --
and slows down.

43:05.750 --> 43:07.884
Bands of charged particles

43:07.886 --> 43:10.620
hit the Earth's
electromagnetic field

43:10.622 --> 43:12.755
and cause the Northern Lights.

43:12.757 --> 43:15.158
At auspicious times they snap

43:15.160 --> 43:17.894
like giant cosmic rubber bands.

43:18.730 --> 43:21.498
That's the sound.

43:21.499 --> 43:24.267
- [Alicia] So, the sun's rays
make big long strings that,

43:24.269 --> 43:27.303
for whatever reason, break
and make a huge sound?

43:27.305 --> 43:29.939
- Yeah, so something
happens on these points

43:32.177 --> 43:33.043
when the 'Sound' hits.

43:33.044 --> 43:33.910
And it says here
that on those spots,

43:33.912 --> 43:36.112
- unless you're near
the center of this web,

43:36.114 --> 43:37.914
you can be transported
somewhere else

43:37.916 --> 43:40.750
and you can play, Snakes...

43:40.752 --> 43:43.002
- [Paula] ...and ladders.

43:43.003 --> 43:45.253
- So, it's like a web, or
the points on a compass.

43:45.256 --> 43:47.890
- But you never really
know where you go.

43:47.892 --> 43:50.059
- And that's where
Charlie might've gone.

43:50.061 --> 43:51.060
- Maybe.

43:51.963 --> 43:52.962
This

43:54.132 --> 43:56.900
is a Timetable.

43:56.901 --> 43:59.669
Once we get to here
that sequence will
start with a 'Sound'.

44:00.639 --> 44:01.938
And it looks like it
won't be long after that

44:01.940 --> 44:03.373
until this is

44:03.375 --> 44:04.240
- [Alicia] over.

44:04.242 --> 44:06.059
- [Paula] Yeah.

44:06.060 --> 44:07.877
- When it starts, it will
repeat itself 12 times,

44:07.879 --> 44:09.646
every five minutes or so.

44:10.215 --> 44:12.299
The timing's unpredictable.

44:12.300 --> 44:14.384
- The accounts I've read
of this are pretty insane.

44:15.654 --> 44:17.186
Where are we on
the timetable now?

44:17.188 --> 44:18.187
- Here.

44:19.324 --> 44:21.508
I'm sorry, you guys.

44:21.509 --> 44:23.693
The number of times I told
myself this wasn't real.

44:23.695 --> 44:24.927
- You're gonna
get us out of this

44:24.929 --> 44:26.296
and we're gonna find Charlie.

44:26.297 --> 44:27.664
Is there anything
else you remember

44:27.666 --> 44:29.399
about the day your
Dad disappeared?

44:31.202 --> 44:33.803
- After I followed
him into the woods,

44:33.805 --> 44:35.772
he was yelling my Mom's name.

44:36.808 --> 44:38.808
And the 'Sound' hit,
really, really loud,

44:38.810 --> 44:40.860
and I fell off my bike.

44:40.861 --> 44:42.911
And I must've stayed on
the ground for a bit.

44:42.914 --> 44:45.081
I got up and I ran
to where he last was,

44:45.083 --> 44:47.250
but there was no one there.

44:48.720 --> 44:49.719
- [Alicia] But you don't
know if you were here

44:49.721 --> 44:50.720
in the center.

44:51.790 --> 44:56.926
(Loud Thunder)

44:57.862 --> 45:00.096
- [Sam] Okay,
everybody get ready.

45:08.173 --> 45:10.907
Brace yourselves, everyone.

45:10.909 --> 45:13.776
(intense music)

45:18.983 --> 45:22.185
(light, tense music)

45:26.991 --> 45:28.925
- [Paula] Was that it?

45:28.927 --> 45:32.128
(light, tense music)

45:38.737 --> 45:40.470
- Does that mean we can

45:40.471 --> 45:42.204
go home...
(Explosion!)

45:42.207 --> 45:47.176
(Mysterious Horn Sound)

45:49.748 --> 45:51.848
- [Alicia] What's that!?

45:51.850 --> 45:56.986
(ghostly whispering) (static
flashes and electric swirls)

45:58.389 --> 45:59.956
(Booms!)

45:59.958 --> 46:03.159
(Paula grunting)

46:03.161 --> 46:04.227
- Too soon!

46:05.864 --> 46:07.430
- She's gone!

46:07.432 --> 46:09.198
(deep digital whirring)

46:09.200 --> 46:11.000
- Time must be speeding up.

46:11.002 --> 46:12.168
(Mysterious Horn Sound)

46:12.170 --> 46:13.570
- Meredith!

46:13.571 --> 46:14.971
(Mysterious Horn
Sound - Swoosh!)

46:14.973 --> 46:15.972
Meredith!

46:19.177 --> 46:20.026
Meredith!

46:20.027 --> 46:20.876
(chaotic digital beeping)

46:20.879 --> 46:23.913
- [Alicia] Meredith! (echo)

46:28.486 --> 46:32.188
(Meredith breathing heavily)

46:32.190 --> 46:34.490
- [Meredith] This
isn't happening.

46:34.492 --> 46:39.796
(booming)

46:47.505 --> 46:49.572
(booming intensifying)

46:49.574 --> 46:52.942
(Meredith screaming)

46:57.215 --> 47:01.017
(Mysterious Horn Sound)

47:01.553 --> 47:02.552
- Oh!

47:06.825 --> 47:09.592
(deep electric swishing)

47:09.594 --> 47:12.094
(static electric sparkles)

47:12.096 --> 47:17.233
(static buzzing and flashes)

47:17.869 --> 47:18.968
- [Sam] Meredith!

47:18.970 --> 47:21.103
Meredith, what happened?

47:21.973 --> 47:26.976
(speaking backwards)

47:35.520 --> 47:36.686
(digital buzzing)

47:36.687 --> 47:37.853
(speaking backwards)

47:37.856 --> 47:41.224
(digital buzzing)

47:41.226 --> 47:43.960
- Tell me what you saw?

47:43.962 --> 47:48.531
(static buzzing)
(Loud Thunder)

47:48.533 --> 47:53.870
(Mysterious Horn Sound)

47:54.405 --> 47:56.072
- Oh!

47:56.074 --> 47:59.008
(women groaning)

48:00.478 --> 48:01.477
Charlie!

48:02.914 --> 48:04.280
(tense music)

48:04.282 --> 48:08.217
(Charlie Roars!)

48:08.219 --> 48:10.553
(ominous music)

48:10.555 --> 48:11.621
(deep swishing)

48:11.623 --> 48:15.157
(women breathing heavily)

48:15.159 --> 48:16.092
(deep swishing)

48:16.094 --> 48:21.230
(ominous music)

48:27.372 --> 48:29.105
(Boom!)

48:29.107 --> 48:32.041
(women grunting)

48:36.547 --> 48:41.684
(mysterious twinkling
music) (static electric
sparkles and flashes)

48:44.055 --> 48:46.188
(Paula crying out)

48:46.190 --> 48:48.357
- My Dad was right.

48:50.228 --> 48:55.031
(yelling) No, my Dad was right!

48:55.033 --> 48:57.300
Sorry, I'm so sorry!

48:57.302 --> 49:00.069
(tense music)

49:00.071 --> 49:01.587
Please!

49:01.588 --> 49:03.104
(dramatic swishing)
(Mysterious Horn Sound)

49:03.107 --> 49:08.144
(deep, ominous music)

49:11.683 --> 49:15.017
(slow, tense music)

49:37.075 --> 49:38.074
(swoosh)

49:46.117 --> 49:51.220
(soft booms)

49:59.630 --> 50:04.767
(Boom!)
(ominous music)

50:11.275 --> 50:13.409
- [Sam] Guys, over here!

50:13.411 --> 50:18.547
(tense, suspenseful music)

50:20.018 --> 50:24.153
(Gunshot Blast)

50:24.155 --> 50:29.291
(rumbling and low swish)

50:35.033 --> 50:37.550
(swishing)

50:37.551 --> 50:40.068
(Mysterious Horn Sound)

50:40.071 --> 50:42.705
(women gasping)

50:42.707 --> 50:46.142
(light tonal buzzing)

50:47.078 --> 50:48.694
- Okay.
- What in the hell's--

50:48.695 --> 50:50.311
- Okay, everybody calm
down, just breathe.

50:50.314 --> 50:51.180
- [Alicia] What the
hell was it shooting at?

50:51.181 --> 50:52.047
(all talking at once)

50:52.050 --> 50:53.816
- Just shut up!

50:53.817 --> 50:55.583
- All right, everyone
in one piece?

50:55.586 --> 50:56.679
Nobody's been hit?

50:56.680 --> 50:57.773
- No, I think we're all good.

50:57.774 --> 50:58.867
- That was incredible,
that was whole other world.

50:58.868 --> 50:59.961
It's real, with us in
it, can you believe it?

50:59.962 --> 51:01.055
- [Sam] We literally

51:06.330 --> 51:06.914
just tried to kill ourselves.
- I can't believe

51:06.915 --> 51:07.499
what just happened, did it?

51:07.500 --> 51:08.084
- That was amazing.
- Why would we

51:08.085 --> 51:08.669
try to kill ourselves?

51:08.670 --> 51:09.254
And why would they--

51:09.255 --> 51:09.839
- That was real, we
have to do it again,

51:09.840 --> 51:10.424
we've got to do it again.

51:10.425 --> 51:11.009
- Do it again, are you crazy!?

51:11.010 --> 51:11.594
- They had a whole system
set up with symbols on trees

51:11.602 --> 51:12.991
just like ours.

51:12.992 --> 51:14.381
- And you wanna go back there?

51:14.382 --> 51:15.771
- No -- somewhere else.

51:15.773 --> 51:17.773
There're three other choices.

51:18.609 --> 51:20.476
There have to be
other dimensions

51:20.478 --> 51:22.161
that have us in them too.

51:22.162 --> 51:23.845
They probably have webs
set up all over too,

51:23.848 --> 51:25.681
and we could travel all
over if we wanted to.

51:25.683 --> 51:27.416
- [Paula] You're crazy.

51:27.417 --> 51:29.150
- I bet all of these
places have versions of us.

51:29.153 --> 51:31.220
- And in this case
they wanna shoot us.

51:31.222 --> 51:32.621
And the place I went to,

51:32.623 --> 51:34.623
I landed on that
backward seven thing

51:34.625 --> 51:37.827
and there was something huge
following me and no people.

51:37.829 --> 51:39.762
I ran to the only
symbol I recognized.

51:39.764 --> 51:42.364
It was a figure 8, infinity sign

51:42.366 --> 51:45.101
that was just there somehow.

51:45.103 --> 51:46.769
- [Alicia] Wait, the infinity,
how did you know to try it?

51:46.771 --> 51:49.505
- That was my only
option, I just guessed.

51:49.507 --> 51:51.373
- So now, we know
what our symbol is.

51:51.375 --> 51:53.142
- We can do it.

51:53.144 --> 51:56.512
Come on, there are other
versions of us in other worlds,

51:56.514 --> 51:59.348
doing different versions of
what we're doing here, right?

51:59.350 --> 52:01.000
Other 'Sams', other 'Paulas'.

52:01.001 --> 52:02.651
- [Sam] And that just
might wanna kill us.

52:02.653 --> 52:04.653
- We stay here in the center!

52:04.655 --> 52:07.756
We won't go anywhere, and we
ride this thing out, simple.

52:11.429 --> 52:12.795
Why are you staring at me?

52:13.798 --> 52:16.198
- Paula, when you
fell off your bike,

52:16.200 --> 52:18.134
you weren't near
the center, right?

52:20.171 --> 52:22.505
Okay, so before you
continue to freak out,

52:23.274 --> 52:25.407
just hear me out.

52:28.146 --> 52:32.448
Paula, maybe it wasn't
your Dad who disappeared.

52:33.518 --> 52:34.517
- What?

52:34.519 --> 52:40.689
- What if - you - disappeared,
and you ended up here.

52:43.461 --> 52:45.661
Just, think about it.

52:45.663 --> 52:49.665
I know it sounds crazy,
but it explains everything.

52:49.667 --> 52:51.734
You came here to this dimension,

52:51.736 --> 52:53.636
or whatever you wanna call it.

52:54.539 --> 52:55.871
Does that make any sense?

52:58.209 --> 52:59.942
- There's something
you don't know, Sam.

53:02.713 --> 53:04.813
Before my Dad disappeared,

53:04.815 --> 53:07.550
there was no such thing
as The Hide and Seek Tree.

53:08.853 --> 53:10.686
I've never been
able to explain it.

53:10.688 --> 53:13.722
I just thought that I
didn't remember it right.

53:13.724 --> 53:15.391
- Because it wasn't
the same woods.

53:15.393 --> 53:18.494
- Then what about your
Dad from this place,

53:19.497 --> 53:20.663
what happened to him?

53:22.600 --> 53:24.900
And what happened to Paula
from here, where is she?

53:24.902 --> 53:27.403
- Who knows, they could've
disappeared to some other place

53:27.405 --> 53:29.772
at the same time, I
mean, I know it's wild

53:29.774 --> 53:31.540
but it explains everything.

53:31.542 --> 53:35.211
You came here, and Dad
and Paula from here

53:35.213 --> 53:39.682
went somewhere else, and
you still had his Notebook.

53:39.684 --> 53:42.451
Nearly identical to the
one that I got from DARPA

53:42.453 --> 53:44.987
that I know belonged to
your Dad in this world.

53:44.989 --> 53:47.323
- Two real books.

53:47.325 --> 53:48.624
Two different worlds.

53:51.229 --> 53:52.228
- You guys.

53:53.297 --> 53:55.397
- Weren't really your friends.

53:55.399 --> 53:58.567
(slow, somber music)

54:05.509 --> 54:07.509
- I don't belong here.

54:10.848 --> 54:13.382
I can't, I can't believe this.

54:13.384 --> 54:14.516
- Just take it easy.

54:18.389 --> 54:19.388
- Wait.

54:28.799 --> 54:33.869
By my count, there are
3 'Sound' events left.

54:34.905 --> 54:38.440
Which means, we
can send you back.

54:40.311 --> 54:41.903
- What?

54:41.904 --> 54:43.496
- One of the points
on the compass

54:43.497 --> 54:45.089
has to be where you came from.

54:45.090 --> 54:46.682
- Okay, can we just
go over this again.

54:46.684 --> 54:49.718
- The center is where we stood
when we came back from Omega.

54:49.720 --> 54:52.354
And, the backwards
7 is where I went.

54:52.356 --> 54:54.823
- And I'm taking Alpha,
or the Eye of Horus next.

54:54.825 --> 54:56.659
- That's insane.

54:56.660 --> 54:58.494
- This is real, and
I'm gonna go somewhere

54:58.496 --> 54:59.828
and bring back
something as proof,

54:59.830 --> 55:01.063
and you'll all be my witnesses.

55:01.065 --> 55:03.916
- Bring back what?

55:03.917 --> 55:06.768
- Me, or another version
of me or one of you,

55:06.771 --> 55:09.672
with knowledge of a
completely different world.

55:10.441 --> 55:12.074
This is worth a fortune.

55:12.075 --> 55:13.708
- Except for the
part where you die.

55:15.780 --> 55:17.446
- I have a 50/50 chance.

55:18.449 --> 55:20.149
I'll come back with
enough time left

55:20.150 --> 55:21.850
for you to repeat the process
and make your way home.

55:21.852 --> 55:23.719
If wherever I go doesn't
have a Hide and Seek Tree,

55:23.721 --> 55:26.322
then we know that
that's your home.

55:26.324 --> 55:28.991
If not, then we know that the
other choice most likely is.

55:28.993 --> 55:29.992
- You sure about this?

55:29.994 --> 55:34.697
(Loud Thunder)

55:38.903 --> 55:40.469
- It's my party.

55:41.505 --> 55:46.642
(rumbling thunder)

55:55.986 --> 55:56.852
(BOOM)

55:56.854 --> 55:58.821
(BOOM)

55:58.823 --> 55:59.888
(BOOM)

55:59.890 --> 56:01.457
(BOOM)

56:01.459 --> 56:04.460
(BOOM)

56:04.461 --> 56:07.462
(Mysterious Horn Sound)

56:09.400 --> 56:12.601
(slow, somber music)

56:22.947 --> 56:26.014
(Boom)

56:35.059 --> 56:39.094
Look, I'm just trying to get
back to my place, my world.

56:39.096 --> 56:43.399
No, no, no, no, please, please.

56:43.401 --> 56:44.800
Please.

56:44.802 --> 56:47.102
No, no, no, no, no.

56:47.104 --> 56:49.938
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, please.

56:49.940 --> 56:50.939
(gun cocking)

56:50.941 --> 56:52.091
Please.

56:52.092 --> 56:53.242
No, please, please, please,
please, please, please.

56:53.243 --> 56:54.393
No, no, no, no, no! (crying)

56:54.394 --> 56:55.544
Mysterious Horn Sound

56:55.546 --> 56:57.780
(Gunshot blast)

56:57.782 --> 56:59.982
(Mysterious Horn Sound)

56:59.984 --> 57:05.087
(somber music)

57:10.561 --> 57:12.561
(Scream!)

57:12.563 --> 57:15.097
(tense music)

57:15.099 --> 57:16.598
- Oh no...

57:17.568 --> 57:20.636
(Thunder)

57:21.839 --> 57:26.742
(Loud Thunder)

57:33.451 --> 57:34.850
- You should go.

57:35.986 --> 57:38.754
(somber music)

58:01.612 --> 58:04.613
(static sparking)

58:06.484 --> 58:09.918
(static electric sparkles
swirling & flashing)

58:09.920 --> 58:14.923
(wind howling) (static
electric sparkles and flashing)

58:29.507 --> 58:34.610
(eerie music)

58:40.784 --> 58:44.653
(eerie voices yelling)

58:44.655 --> 58:47.789
(suspenseful music)

58:51.862 --> 58:56.965
(Mysterious Horn Sound)

59:10.781 --> 59:13.115
(swish)

59:16.820 --> 59:21.723
(Boom)

59:27.231 --> 59:29.698
(gasping)

59:38.108 --> 59:39.107
- Okay.

59:45.683 --> 59:47.466
Okay.

59:47.467 --> 59:49.250
(tense, suspenseful music)

59:56.727 --> 59:57.726
Okay.

59:59.730 --> 01:00:00.729
Okay.

01:00:04.668 --> 01:00:06.468
Okay.

01:00:06.469 --> 01:00:08.269
(tense, suspenseful music)

01:00:58.188 --> 01:00:59.187
(twig snaps)

01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:28.350
(car approaching)

01:01:35.959 --> 01:01:38.694
(tense music)

01:01:49.006 --> 01:01:50.372
(truck door shutting)

01:01:54.978 --> 01:01:56.311
- What's your name?

01:01:57.815 --> 01:01:59.281
What's your name?

01:02:00.851 --> 01:02:05.987
- Paula, it's Paula,
I'm your daughter!

01:02:12.262 --> 01:02:14.429
I have your Notebooks.

01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:17.866
(slow, somber music)

01:02:21.271 --> 01:02:26.208
(tense music)

01:02:29.813 --> 01:02:31.847
- It's her, it worked.

01:02:33.884 --> 01:02:35.150
She found her way back.

01:02:40.991 --> 01:02:42.390
- There's someone here who's
been trying to meet you

01:02:42.392 --> 01:02:43.759
for quite awhile.

01:02:46.296 --> 01:02:49.498
(slow, somber music)

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:07.182
- [Paula 2] Your Mother will
be very happy to see you.

01:03:07.184 --> 01:03:08.383
Wait.

01:03:08.385 --> 01:03:09.384
- There!

01:03:09.386 --> 01:03:13.789
The girls from Omega have used
the 'Sound' to cross over.

01:03:13.791 --> 01:03:14.823
Prime the weapon.

01:03:14.825 --> 01:03:18.126
Move towards me as
quick as you can.

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:19.461
Move, now.

01:03:19.463 --> 01:03:20.562
Now! RUN!

01:03:21.331 --> 01:03:23.198
(scary music)

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:24.332
FIRE!

01:03:24.334 --> 01:03:25.934
(lasers swishing)

01:03:25.936 --> 01:03:27.068
(digital exploding)

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:32.207
(intense music)

01:03:32.843 --> 01:03:34.042
(Electric Implosion!)

01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:44.586
(gentle, sorrowful choral music)

01:05:29.192 --> 01:05:34.162
(insects  buzzing)

01:05:34.164 --> 01:05:39.100
(gentle, sorrowful music)

01:05:57.287 --> 01:06:00.455
(radio static buzzing)

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:03.959
- Baker to dispatch, Baker
to dispatch, come in, over.

01:06:06.029 --> 01:06:08.063
- [Dispatch] Sheriff,
this is dispatch.

01:06:08.065 --> 01:06:09.965
It's great to hear your voice.

01:06:09.967 --> 01:06:11.967
It's been a Hell of a day here.

01:06:11.969 --> 01:06:15.103
Someone walked in who
looked just like you,

01:06:15.105 --> 01:06:18.606
said she was you and started
talking about triangles

01:06:18.608 --> 01:06:23.011
and portals, and - do you have
a Twin we don't know about?

01:06:23.013 --> 01:06:24.012
Over.

01:06:24.748 --> 01:06:28.116
(slow, solemn music)

01:06:36.159 --> 01:06:37.826
Sheriff?

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:39.494
(slow, dramatic music)

01:06:47.537 --> 01:06:51.506
(light, upbeat guitar music)

01:07:02.452 --> 01:07:05.587
¶ I feel alone ¶

01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:09.324
¶ In the shadows of the Moon ¶

01:07:09.326 --> 01:07:14.462
¶ I would die if you
held me close tonight ¶

01:07:16.566 --> 01:07:20.568
¶ 'Cause these hands
have held tight ¶

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:24.305
¶ My arms sore from the fight ¶

01:07:24.307 --> 01:07:29.444
¶ I've been waiting to
hear these words from you ¶

01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:37.485
¶ I am on your side ¶

¶ Tonight ¶

01:07:50.167 --> 01:07:53.435
(upbeat music)

01:08:01.812 --> 01:08:05.547
¶ Is it time I let go ¶

01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:09.150
¶ 'Cause I'm holding
on for life ¶

01:08:09.152 --> 01:08:14.289
¶ There is no one that
can love you like I do ¶

01:08:16.626 --> 01:08:18.460
¶ Should I beg? ¶

01:08:18.462 --> 01:08:20.462
¶ Should I plead? ¶

01:08:20.464 --> 01:08:22.229
¶ Should I kneel? ¶

01:08:22.232 --> 01:08:24.198
¶ Should I bleed? ¶

01:08:24.201 --> 01:08:29.337

to leave without my hand ¶

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:37.745

¶ I'm nothing

¶ Don't let me go,
let's run away ¶

01:09:15.152 --> 01:09:16.751

stars tonight ¶

01:09:16.752 --> 01:09:19.554
¶ Ooh, ooh, oh ¶

(quick, upbeat guitar music)

01:09:32.569 --> 01:09:37.705
¶ Hold your hand in mine ¶

01:09:39.442 --> 01:09:44.578

¶ Ooh, ooh ¶

01:10:28.892 --> 01:10:30.491
- Breaking news from
Mount Shasta, California.

01:10:30.493 --> 01:10:32.260
One person is dead
and two are missing

01:10:32.262 --> 01:10:34.829
following weeks of bizarre
activity in the area.

01:10:34.831 --> 01:10:37.498
Shasta's no stranger to
unexplained incidents.

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.667
Over the years, numerous
residents have vanished,

01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:42.120
livestock have disappeared,

01:10:42.121 --> 01:10:44.572
and people around here are
hearing a loud, ominous 'Sound'.

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:47.275
Some people are even claiming
to see a strange young woman

01:10:47.277 --> 01:10:50.678
wearing what one local farmer
described as a glowing shroud.

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:52.180
That farmer is with me now.

01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:53.681
Sir, can you tell
me what you saw?

01:10:55.385 --> 01:10:57.852
- I was pickin'
apples in the yard,

01:10:57.854 --> 01:11:00.255
and that 'Sound' happened again.

01:11:00.257 --> 01:11:01.923
It's been happenin'
a lot lately.

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:05.426
And then this woman
showed up out of nowhere.

01:11:05.428 --> 01:11:07.795
I thought maybe she
was lost or somethin'.

01:11:07.797 --> 01:11:12.934
I said, "Hello," and she started
to flicker, kinda 'glow'.

01:11:14.304 --> 01:11:15.903
- What happened next?

01:11:15.905 --> 01:11:17.783
- I've seen that
kind of thing before

01:11:17.784 --> 01:11:19.662
so I got the Hell outta there.

01:11:19.663 --> 01:11:21.541
That 'Sound' always comes
just before the weird stuff.

01:11:21.544 --> 01:11:23.711
It was the same thing
20-some-odd years ago.

01:11:23.713 --> 01:11:25.580
When those people,
they went missin',

01:11:25.582 --> 01:11:27.949
and those other people just
showed up outta nowhere.

01:11:27.951 --> 01:11:29.684
All kinds of government
experts and such,

01:11:29.686 --> 01:11:31.419
they came out here
pokin' around,

01:11:31.421 --> 01:11:32.520
they couldn't figure
it out either.

01:11:32.522 --> 01:11:34.322
They all said I was nuts.

01:11:35.058 --> 01:11:36.424
Now someone's dead.

01:11:36.426 --> 01:11:40.695
People around here want answers
and they want 'em right now.

01:11:40.697 --> 01:11:42.363
- Well judging by the
number of incidents

01:11:42.365 --> 01:11:44.082
in the Shasta area lately,

01:11:44.083 --> 01:11:45.800
it doesn't look like we'll
have any answers any time soon.

01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:48.069
Rick Mosier, Shasta County News.

01:11:48.071 --> 01:11:51.339
(mellow music)

01:11:59.582 --> 01:12:04.686
¶ Waiting for something ¶

01:12:05.455 --> 01:12:09.691
¶ To make me feel alive ¶

01:12:09.693 --> 01:12:14.529
¶ I sit by my window ¶

01:12:14.531 --> 01:12:19.667
¶ Watching strangers pass by ¶

01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:24.906
¶ Lord knows it's been so long ¶

01:12:24.908 --> 01:12:30.044
¶ Since I let someone in ¶

01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:34.982
¶ You were the last time ¶

01:12:41.491 --> 01:12:46.627
¶ And I'm still haunted ¶

01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:51.399
¶ Your voice in my head ¶

01:12:51.401 --> 01:12:55.636
¶ The way that you blamed me ¶

01:12:55.638 --> 01:13:00.675
¶ For the things that you said ¶

01:13:01.678 --> 01:13:06.814
¶ I'm praying for someone ¶

01:13:07.517 --> 01:13:11.786
¶ To help me forget ¶

01:13:11.788 --> 01:13:15.790
¶ But I haven't found him yet ¶

01:13:22.766 --> 01:13:27.902
¶ Lord break me down ¶

01:13:32.776 --> 01:13:36.411
¶ Take these walls of stone ¶

01:13:36.413 --> 01:13:41.549
¶ And send them crashing down ¶

01:13:43.787 --> 01:13:47.822
¶ Make me naked ¶

01:13:47.824 --> 01:13:52.960
¶ And shake me to my bones ¶

01:13:54.097 --> 01:13:57.565
¶ Lord break me down ¶
