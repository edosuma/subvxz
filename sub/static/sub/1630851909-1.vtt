00:20.708 --> 00:21.541
Are you okay?

00:28.125 --> 00:29.291
Just a second.

00:45.833 --> 00:47.708
This can't be your first body.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.125
No, but I know her.

00:54.125 --> 00:55.083
Knew her.

00:56.166 --> 00:58.166
We were classmates in grade school.

00:59.416 --> 01:00.833
You dated for a while, right?

01:02.708 --> 01:03.833
-No.
-No.

01:08.083 --> 01:11.041
She was always careful.
I don't understand how she ended up here.

01:11.916 --> 01:13.833
It looks like natural causes.

01:17.916 --> 01:18.833
Out here?

01:22.666 --> 01:25.416
Don't people use this field as a shortcut?

01:26.083 --> 01:27.291
Isn't that a bit odd?

01:28.416 --> 01:32.583
I hate to order an autopsy
for "a bit odd."

01:33.208 --> 01:34.666
It ruins the budget.

01:35.208 --> 01:36.041
But…

01:36.625 --> 01:39.041
A dead woman in the woods.
We don't have a choice.

01:43.083 --> 01:44.541
When is the ambulance coming?

01:47.291 --> 01:48.958
What's the ambulance going to do?

01:49.041 --> 01:51.291
-Transport her--
-You watch too many movies.

01:51.833 --> 01:55.416
In the movies, the ambulance comes
and picks up the bodies.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.083
They even use blue lights,
as if it's a matter of life and death.

01:59.666 --> 02:01.291
But it isn't. It's just death.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.958
Who else is going to pick her up?

02:06.750 --> 02:13.750
HALLANGEN FUNERAL PARLOR

02:15.833 --> 02:17.833
Three. Three behind the register.

02:19.125 --> 02:20.583
Yeah. Is the blue one there?

02:20.666 --> 02:22.083
Yes, the blue one too.

02:22.166 --> 02:23.791
The blue one too. Okay.

02:23.875 --> 02:25.791
Plus 30.

02:26.875 --> 02:27.708
Plus six.

02:28.250 --> 02:30.333
There are 39 urns up here.

02:30.416 --> 02:33.083
Thirty-nine. And then check…

02:33.166 --> 02:35.250
-What about the caskets then?
-Yes.

02:39.041 --> 02:39.875
Let's see.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.083
So we have…

02:43.458 --> 02:46.250
one, two… We have five of the 21 casket.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.583
Five… just a moment. Five 21s.

02:49.791 --> 02:52.500
And we have
one mahogany-stained cherry wood.

02:53.833 --> 02:55.416
Which would have saved Christmas.

02:57.041 --> 02:59.250
But no one dies in Skarnes.

03:05.083 --> 03:05.916
The police.

03:09.458 --> 03:10.416
Let's see…

03:11.208 --> 03:12.875
-Yes, it's…
-Yes, of course.

03:13.500 --> 03:16.583
This is Hallangen Funeral Parlor,
Arvid speaking.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.041
Yes, thank you.

03:49.666 --> 03:52.083
The funeral parlor can't pick up

03:52.166 --> 03:53.583
Live Hallangen.

03:53.666 --> 03:54.791
Why not?

03:56.541 --> 03:59.208
Hallangen Funeral Parlor.

04:00.583 --> 04:02.125
Live Hallangen.

04:05.916 --> 04:08.041
Even though
it's your sister we're getting,

04:09.041 --> 04:11.583
a funeral director is a swan.

04:12.958 --> 04:16.083
Poised and elegant on the surface,
while the legs…

04:16.166 --> 04:19.583
While the legs work like crazy
under the water. I know.

04:53.125 --> 04:55.250
Odd. Come on.

04:57.583 --> 04:59.166
One, two, and three.

05:17.041 --> 05:18.041
Let's see, then.

05:19.916 --> 05:21.875
Found in a field outside Skarnes.

05:21.958 --> 05:24.625
-You know what they say about Skarnes?
-No.

05:24.708 --> 05:28.166
In the '90s, they said it was
the perfect place to kill someone.

05:28.250 --> 05:30.333
-Why?
-Because the police were lazy.

05:30.416 --> 05:32.041
Or are lazy?

05:33.166 --> 05:38.125
I see no signs of superficial injuries,
no trauma to the torso, legs or head.

05:39.291 --> 05:42.166
I hate to say it,
but it looks like natural causes.

05:42.250 --> 05:43.833
A woman in her early thirties?

05:43.916 --> 05:47.875
An ailment, a sudden seizure,
a blood clot caused by birth control,

05:47.958 --> 05:49.291
or maybe an overdose.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.041
Yeah, but we're still going to…

05:52.125 --> 05:54.416
Of course we'll do an autopsy.
We're at work, after all.

05:55.833 --> 05:59.000
It costs the rural police
half their annual budget

05:59.083 --> 06:00.500
to order an autopsy.

06:00.583 --> 06:03.583
The Skarnes police earned
a reputation for how they…

06:04.333 --> 06:05.833
-What?
-That's strange.

06:06.583 --> 06:07.750
What is?

06:07.833 --> 06:09.958
The deceased hemorrhaging post mortem.

06:10.041 --> 06:11.166
Huh?

06:11.250 --> 06:12.708
Yeah, but… look.

06:17.166 --> 06:18.208
What?

06:18.291 --> 06:20.250
I'm just noting that it's strange.

06:20.333 --> 06:21.458
That's what I said.

06:21.541 --> 06:22.833
So what?

06:22.916 --> 06:25.875
It's not like
I'm writing "strange" in the report

06:25.958 --> 06:28.875
and stealing your genius observation.

06:29.541 --> 06:31.500
Shall we go on,
or is it too strange for you?

06:31.583 --> 06:33.541
No, it's not too strange for me.

06:33.625 --> 06:35.125
No? It's not? Great.

06:35.208 --> 06:37.916
Let's declare Live Hallangen
open for business.

06:38.583 --> 06:42.500
We declare Live Hallangen
open for business.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.041
A NETFLIX SERIES

08:14.166 --> 08:16.708
Hallangen Funeral Parlor, Arvid speaking.

08:16.791 --> 08:20.416
Yes, hello.
Are you Live Hallangen's closest relative?

08:20.958 --> 08:21.958
Yes.

08:22.041 --> 08:24.541
It's hard to explain what's happened here,

08:24.625 --> 08:27.291
if it's routine error or a miracle.

08:27.375 --> 08:28.625
She's not dead.

08:28.708 --> 08:30.875
She woke up at the forensic institute,

08:30.958 --> 08:33.416
and she's been
placed under observation at…

08:39.250 --> 08:40.125
Shit.

09:10.416 --> 09:11.708
Odd…

09:12.791 --> 09:14.250
-Hi.
-Hi.

09:15.083 --> 09:16.000
Hi.

09:17.416 --> 09:18.500
You're happy.

09:19.041 --> 09:19.916
Yes.

09:26.875 --> 09:29.166
What happened?

09:30.791 --> 09:32.041
You don't remember?

09:35.500 --> 09:36.375
Hello, Live.

09:37.208 --> 09:38.125
Hello.

09:39.250 --> 09:41.125
-So you're awake.
-Yes.

09:41.208 --> 09:42.958
-How are you?
-Well…

09:44.000 --> 09:46.291
-Great.
-Look straight ahead, please.

09:51.833 --> 09:53.083
Yes, good.

09:53.166 --> 09:54.583
What happened?

09:55.958 --> 09:57.208
You were dead.

09:57.291 --> 09:58.708
Or we thought you were dead.

10:01.333 --> 10:03.708
Yeah, some joggers found you

10:03.791 --> 10:05.875
out in the field near the old barn,

10:07.250 --> 10:10.375
and then they called the police,
the police called us, and we came

10:11.375 --> 10:13.500
and picked you up,
took you to the coroner,

10:13.583 --> 10:15.458
and you woke up on the autopsy table.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.208
You came… You came to pick me up?
You mean you and Dad?

10:23.416 --> 10:24.666
Who else?

10:24.750 --> 10:28.541
Like Odd says, you were found in a field,

10:29.916 --> 10:31.750
and we think you had a seizure

10:32.500 --> 10:33.666
while on a walk.

10:35.125 --> 10:37.958
Do you remember
if you were out for a walk?

10:44.166 --> 10:45.000
No.

10:46.375 --> 10:47.500
Well…

10:48.041 --> 10:50.291
-Yesterday?
-Thursday evening.

10:51.708 --> 10:52.583
What day is it?

10:56.250 --> 10:57.541
Today is Monday.

11:05.750 --> 11:08.083
How could you think I was dead?

11:09.208 --> 11:12.416
Medically speaking,
it could be due to hypothermia,

11:12.500 --> 11:13.916
a cooling of the body.

11:14.666 --> 11:16.958
It can cause this kind of apparent death.

11:18.541 --> 11:21.416
Hypothermia causes
body temperature to drop severely,

11:21.916 --> 11:23.250
and all bodily functions,

11:23.333 --> 11:25.875
cellular metabolism, slow down a lot.

11:26.416 --> 11:28.291
It can be lethal. The heart can stop.

11:28.375 --> 11:31.250
We've had cases
where the heart stopped for seven hours

11:31.333 --> 11:32.791
in the most serious instances.

11:32.875 --> 11:33.875
Hey, Odd.

11:33.958 --> 11:37.916
Can you go out and tell Reinert
and Judith that Live is awake?

11:38.000 --> 11:39.416
They're waiting in the café.

11:39.500 --> 11:40.666
-Sure.
-Great.

11:41.458 --> 11:43.541
-Can you bring me a drink?
-Yes.

11:50.750 --> 11:51.708
-Yes?
-Dad?

11:52.250 --> 11:54.416
-Hi, Odd.
-She's awake now.

11:55.875 --> 11:57.875
Is she… different?

11:57.958 --> 11:59.583
She looks really good, actually.

11:59.666 --> 12:01.541
A little tired, of course, but…

12:02.416 --> 12:04.250
So you can visit now if you want to.

12:05.166 --> 12:06.458
-No.
-All right.

12:07.208 --> 12:08.916
-Or, yeah…
-I'll see you at home.

12:10.875 --> 12:12.291
-See you at home, then.
-Yes.

12:12.375 --> 12:13.416
-Bye.
-Bye.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.375
I want you to come
for checkups for a while,

12:20.458 --> 12:22.541
for blood tests and observation.

12:22.625 --> 12:23.791
Yes, absolutely.

12:23.875 --> 12:26.625
I just still don't understand

12:27.166 --> 12:28.250
what's wrong with me.

12:28.791 --> 12:29.625
Nothing.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.041
All your tests are very good.

12:33.166 --> 12:36.125
So, if you're ready,
you can be released today.

12:42.875 --> 12:44.250
Only if you feel well enough.

12:46.291 --> 12:47.708
Where are you going?

12:47.791 --> 12:49.875
To find the vending machine, of course.

12:52.625 --> 12:54.833
Yeah, so it was obviously a shock, but…

12:58.375 --> 12:59.416
Hi there.

13:00.416 --> 13:02.875
The police want to talk to you,
so I'll wait in the room.

13:02.958 --> 13:04.125
Yeah.

13:04.208 --> 13:06.291
-Hi.
-Stocking up for winter?

13:06.375 --> 13:08.041
You want a few more?

13:08.125 --> 13:10.791
Life is clearly too short
to only pick one.

13:14.750 --> 13:15.958
Do you have a few minutes?

13:17.625 --> 13:19.416
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

13:27.541 --> 13:30.750
Your clothes from the forensic institute.

13:30.833 --> 13:31.875
Thank you.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.208
We want to apologize
for this whole situation.

13:39.291 --> 13:41.166
We take full responsibility.

13:41.250 --> 13:43.083
For ordering an autopsy

13:43.166 --> 13:45.833
when I wasn't dead enough
to be sent in for one?

13:46.583 --> 13:50.083
-In our defense, you looked really dead.
-Very.

13:51.958 --> 13:53.875
What we want to say now…

13:53.958 --> 13:55.375
What I want to say now,

13:55.916 --> 13:58.541
is that the press
will want to write about this.

13:59.208 --> 14:00.500
-The local paper?
-No.

14:01.375 --> 14:03.291
All of them. They've all called.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.708
-They want to sensationalize this.
-Yes.

14:05.791 --> 14:09.708
"The police sent
a living girl to be buried

14:10.708 --> 14:12.083
by her own family."

14:12.875 --> 14:14.000
That kind of thing.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.541
-Isn't that what you did?
-Yes.

14:17.625 --> 14:18.541
-No.
-No.

14:19.500 --> 14:20.333
Well…

14:22.250 --> 14:25.583
We're just trying to look out
for you in all of this, Live.

14:32.916 --> 14:34.291
Did she get mad at me?

14:35.125 --> 14:36.041
Because she…

14:39.416 --> 14:40.333
No?

14:41.958 --> 14:45.125
I just felt there was
some negative energy between us there.

14:46.791 --> 14:47.708
Fuck.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.333
So how long did it take

15:03.666 --> 15:05.708
before Dad started planning the funeral?

15:08.208 --> 15:09.583
Flowers, coffin.

15:10.875 --> 15:12.250
What were you going to play?

15:13.625 --> 15:15.583
"You Raise Me Up," he decided.

15:16.458 --> 15:17.458
That's no fun.

15:18.333 --> 15:20.916
It's not supposed to be. It's a funeral.

15:23.708 --> 15:24.916
We were thinking…

15:34.750 --> 15:35.958
Odd.

15:40.125 --> 15:40.958
Odd.

15:42.750 --> 15:45.166
Fine… nice…

15:47.083 --> 15:49.083
Just as well that I'm not dead.

15:49.166 --> 15:51.583
That would've been awful.

15:52.750 --> 15:53.750
Then it goes…

16:17.250 --> 16:19.041
I'm just going to say hi to Dad.

16:19.125 --> 16:20.083
Yeah, do that.

16:22.125 --> 16:23.083
Dad?

16:24.708 --> 16:25.583
Dad?

16:30.333 --> 16:31.375
Dad?

16:42.750 --> 16:43.625
What's going on?

16:45.125 --> 16:48.916
I think he feels pretty guilty
for not realizing you were alive.

16:51.416 --> 16:55.250
He's done this for a while,
but he's used to picking up dead people.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.791
He's not used to them coming back.

16:59.791 --> 17:00.625
No.

17:01.166 --> 17:02.041
Poor thing.

17:02.791 --> 17:04.791
-Hello.
-Hi, darling.

17:09.291 --> 17:11.041
I'll take those.

17:11.125 --> 17:12.208
Thanks.

17:12.291 --> 17:13.833
-Hello.
-Hi, sweetie.

17:17.458 --> 17:20.416
-Hi.
-Hi. It's so good to see you.

17:22.666 --> 17:25.666
Gosh. Is there any wine left
for the rest of the town?

17:26.416 --> 17:27.250
No.

17:28.125 --> 17:32.083
When they've died and come back,
then they'll get the wine.

17:39.125 --> 17:40.041
Well…

17:47.041 --> 17:49.458
CHLOROFORM

18:10.500 --> 18:11.750
-Odd?
-Yeah?

18:11.833 --> 18:14.333
You're sure you didn't find my necklace?

18:14.875 --> 18:15.916
Yes.

18:17.375 --> 18:21.708
I'm sure we didn't find your necklace,
phone charger, or headphones.

18:21.791 --> 18:25.125
I don't always have
my charger and headphones with me.

18:25.208 --> 18:26.916
Chocolate before dinner?

18:27.000 --> 18:30.250
Odd, I just came back from the dead.
I can do what I want.

18:30.333 --> 18:33.250
Yeah, but Rose is about to roast
a whole moose.

18:34.166 --> 18:35.333
You're so childish.

18:35.416 --> 18:36.541
You're childish.

18:36.625 --> 18:38.875
I'm not 32 and living
in my childhood bedroom.

18:39.625 --> 18:41.791
You keep insisting
that I should keep living here.

18:51.708 --> 18:53.208
Should I go upstairs and get Dad?

18:53.291 --> 18:55.333
No, he'll probably come down soon.

18:55.416 --> 18:58.708
By the way, everyone at work
sends their best, Live.

18:59.250 --> 19:01.833
They were very happy that you're not dead.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.625
How unbelievably nice.

19:10.166 --> 19:11.000
Hi.

19:11.833 --> 19:12.833
There you are.

19:18.416 --> 19:20.000
Dad, everything's all right.

19:25.666 --> 19:27.791
It's so dark in here.

19:42.833 --> 19:45.916
-Then we're all set.
-No, thanks. I'm not hungry anymore.

19:49.875 --> 19:50.916
Dad?

19:52.416 --> 19:54.333
I just need some air, I think.

20:00.208 --> 20:01.125
Yeah.

20:28.666 --> 20:31.000
-What was that?
-I have no idea.

20:31.083 --> 20:33.541
I know your family's weird, but…

20:33.625 --> 20:36.000
These are special circumstances.

20:36.083 --> 20:39.958
She woke up on an autopsy table.
No wonder she has PTSD.

20:40.041 --> 20:42.166
Sure, but doesn't she seem different?

20:42.250 --> 20:44.416
Different? She appeared to be dead.

20:45.958 --> 20:47.583
But you also thought it was odd?

20:47.666 --> 20:49.416
Can we not have this conversation now?

20:49.500 --> 20:51.958
-She can't hear us.
-No, but still.

20:52.041 --> 20:55.416
Sure. Okay, I'll drop it.
I just thought it was a bit…

20:55.500 --> 20:56.458
Yeah…

23:01.041 --> 23:02.125
Dear Arvid.

23:03.666 --> 23:05.541
When you hear this, I'll be dead.

23:07.125 --> 23:09.291
For good, this time.

23:10.375 --> 23:12.916
I have really tried for you

23:13.875 --> 23:15.166
and for the kids,

23:15.250 --> 23:17.500
but I have no other choice.

23:18.500 --> 23:19.625
Take care of yourself.

23:20.125 --> 23:22.750
And you have to take care of our kids.

23:26.333 --> 23:30.083
If you ever see my darkness in Live, well…

23:30.958 --> 23:32.375
Keep an eye on her.

23:33.958 --> 23:36.083
Look out for the changes
you've seen in me.

23:39.250 --> 23:40.083
…well…

23:40.750 --> 23:42.291
Keep an eye on her.

23:43.666 --> 23:46.125
Look out for the changes
you've seen in me.

23:47.708 --> 23:50.000
If you see my darkness in Live,
you have to--

23:52.875 --> 23:57.458
POLICE

24:01.583 --> 24:02.458
Hello!

24:04.208 --> 24:05.208
Reinert!

24:15.250 --> 24:17.750
-What's happened? Are you okay?
-Someone tried to kill me.

24:17.833 --> 24:18.666
Now?

24:18.750 --> 24:20.291
No! At the barn.

24:20.375 --> 24:21.750
Where you found me.

24:23.250 --> 24:24.541
I remember it now.

24:25.541 --> 24:26.583
I was attacked.

24:31.166 --> 24:33.666
-Yeah. Okay.
-Aren't you going to do something?

24:37.750 --> 24:40.375
I think you need some rest, Live.

24:47.625 --> 24:48.958
Live. Wait.

24:49.041 --> 24:51.000
Why? You don't believe me.

24:51.083 --> 24:54.083
But of course--
It's not that-- But you weren't hurt!

24:54.166 --> 24:57.458
The doctors found
no signs of assault, did they?

24:57.541 --> 25:01.166
I have no explanation for this.
I just know what I remember.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.375
-Yeah.
-Even if you think I'm crazy.

25:04.458 --> 25:07.125
No. I don't think that at all, Live.

25:24.958 --> 25:28.000
Well, have a nice evening.
All things considered, of course.

25:31.250 --> 25:32.666
They took my necklace.

25:33.708 --> 25:34.541
Who?

25:35.416 --> 25:36.958
Well, I don't know.

25:38.083 --> 25:38.958
But

25:39.916 --> 25:41.125
I had a necklace.

25:41.791 --> 25:45.375
Mom's wedding ring, which I always wear.

25:46.833 --> 25:48.000
It's gone.

25:49.166 --> 25:51.458
The most important thing
is that you're safe.

25:53.958 --> 25:56.791
The most important thing
is that it doesn't happen again.

26:06.041 --> 26:07.208
Good night.

26:24.583 --> 26:25.541
Where were you?

26:28.125 --> 26:30.500
-Well, I…
-How are you feeling?

26:35.875 --> 26:36.708
Okay.

26:37.250 --> 26:39.250
The man who walked you home…

26:40.666 --> 26:42.750
-Yeah?
-Yeah, was that Reinert?

26:43.708 --> 26:44.541
Yes.

26:46.708 --> 26:47.708
How is he?

26:49.833 --> 26:51.625
I don't know. I didn't ask.

26:56.875 --> 26:57.833
Dad?

26:59.666 --> 27:01.041
What's happening?

27:03.666 --> 27:06.000
You didn't once visit me in the hospital

27:06.541 --> 27:08.833
after driving me to the autopsy.

27:12.541 --> 27:14.916
You won't talk to me after I've come home.

27:18.666 --> 27:19.625
I'm sorry.

28:04.416 --> 28:05.250
Odd?

28:05.791 --> 28:06.750
Live?

28:11.750 --> 28:12.833
What are you doing?

28:14.041 --> 28:18.708
Getting rid of the smell of a guy who was
on a heated floor before coming to us.

28:19.750 --> 28:20.875
I put him here.

28:21.666 --> 28:24.416
Then that thing went to shit,
stuff dripped down on him,

28:24.500 --> 28:28.500
wound up on the floor, and now
the smell is stuck under the linoleum.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.583
It was four months ago,

28:32.875 --> 28:35.291
but he's still with us.
The smell, sort of.

28:53.708 --> 28:55.416
I just don't understand him.

28:55.500 --> 28:57.291
Not everyone gets the privilege.

28:58.625 --> 29:00.583
But you know what he's like.

29:01.250 --> 29:04.541
What this job is like.
You can't be too sensitive.

29:04.625 --> 29:06.166
'Cause then you can't do it.

29:06.250 --> 29:07.291
Too sensitive?

29:08.791 --> 29:11.083
That's not it. He's all weird now.

29:12.708 --> 29:15.291
He hasn't once asked me how I am,

29:15.375 --> 29:17.541
but he wants to know how Reinert is.

29:17.625 --> 29:18.750
Reinert?

29:18.833 --> 29:21.958
Yes. He walked me home
from the police station earlier.

29:22.041 --> 29:24.416
The first thing Dad says is,
"How's Reinert?"

29:25.416 --> 29:26.916
Why were you at the police station?

29:27.625 --> 29:30.041
-Did something happen?
-No, I was just passing by.

29:30.125 --> 29:31.583
And he was standing there.

29:34.041 --> 29:36.208
But he was relieved that I wasn't dead.

29:36.750 --> 29:39.291
Otherwise, he'd have to start
a murder investigation.

29:39.833 --> 29:43.791
Reinert would have loved that,
even though he fancies you.

29:43.875 --> 29:44.708
Yeah.

29:50.083 --> 29:52.250
But who would have tried to kill me?

29:56.333 --> 29:59.750
I haven't done anything, ever,

30:00.291 --> 30:02.833
that would make someone hate me that much.

30:16.041 --> 30:17.083
I have lived

30:18.666 --> 30:19.833
an ordinary life.

30:25.333 --> 30:27.541
So if someone tried to kill me,

30:28.291 --> 30:31.000
I must have been a random victim,
don't you think?

30:36.291 --> 30:40.625
I think you need to stop listening
to those true crime podcasts.

30:44.833 --> 30:49.083
But the police said they didn't find
any sign of criminal activity, right?

30:50.625 --> 30:51.500
Yeah.

30:52.416 --> 30:55.166
Wasn't it just a weird accident,
a minor seizure?

30:57.791 --> 30:58.791
Yeah.

30:59.708 --> 31:00.708
It probably was.

31:10.375 --> 31:11.500
A relapse?

31:14.791 --> 31:15.916
-Were you scared?
-No.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.958
Yeah, you were. I saw it.

31:18.041 --> 31:19.541
You're not that good an actor.

31:20.125 --> 31:21.083
Yeah, but, you know,

31:21.166 --> 31:23.750
there's something about
a near-death experience

31:23.833 --> 31:27.958
that makes you consider
what you have and don't have in life.

31:28.500 --> 31:32.541
Like a job and a family,
friends, mortal enemies.

31:33.125 --> 31:34.250
That sort of thing.

31:35.583 --> 31:38.125
I almost wish
there was a killer in Skarnes.

31:39.625 --> 31:42.291
-At least you'd have something to do.
-Exactly.

31:53.625 --> 31:54.458
Live?

31:55.291 --> 31:56.125
Yeah?

31:57.625 --> 31:59.333
Can you come in here for a minute?

32:41.000 --> 32:42.041
Odd.

32:42.708 --> 32:44.916
-What?
-For fuck's sake.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.708
-What is it?
-Have you been working?

32:47.291 --> 32:48.208
Yeah, but I washed.

32:48.291 --> 32:51.666
You smell like sanitizer and formalin.
That's no better.

32:52.541 --> 32:54.541
-Isn't that better than a corpse?
-No.

32:55.291 --> 32:57.458
-Yes, it is.
-No, it isn't.

32:59.041 --> 33:02.625
No, you can't do that now. You stink.

33:02.708 --> 33:04.125
I'll sleep on the couch.

33:05.541 --> 33:06.958
Go take a shower.

33:07.041 --> 33:08.166
I'm ovulating.

33:16.916 --> 33:17.875
I'm sorry.

34:09.750 --> 34:10.583
Dad?

34:12.291 --> 34:13.500
Yeah.

34:14.208 --> 34:15.666
-Hi.
-Hi.

34:16.333 --> 34:17.625
What are you doing?

34:17.708 --> 34:21.791
I'm going to the crematorium
to tidy the tool closet.

34:22.916 --> 34:26.000
I can't sleep knowing that
the candlesticks are unpolished.

34:26.750 --> 34:27.875
Okay.

34:27.958 --> 34:29.333
-Drive safely.
-Yeah.

34:49.500 --> 34:51.125
-Now you smell nice.
-Thanks.

34:51.208 --> 34:52.333
Very lovely.

35:00.250 --> 35:01.291
What's up?

35:01.375 --> 35:03.583
I'm wondering
if I should've gone with Dad.

35:05.916 --> 35:07.375
You're really thinking about Arvid?

35:07.458 --> 35:08.375
Odd!

35:08.916 --> 35:11.833
But those candlesticks
are my responsibility.

35:12.958 --> 35:14.458
You think it was a criticism?

35:26.500 --> 35:28.375
It's already too late. He's leaving.

35:29.750 --> 35:32.125
It's just so typical of him
not to wait until morning.

35:32.208 --> 35:33.791
Of course I don't mind doing it.

35:33.875 --> 35:35.333
I know, it's terrible.

35:35.875 --> 35:36.875
-You want to fuck?
-Yeah.

35:38.750 --> 35:39.916
He's already left, so…

36:25.583 --> 36:26.833
Help!

36:27.458 --> 36:28.791
Help!

36:31.416 --> 36:32.625
Help me!

36:49.875 --> 36:53.083
Help! Help me out of here!

36:53.166 --> 36:56.666
Help me!

37:00.500 --> 37:02.333
Help!

37:22.375 --> 37:24.666
Help!

37:24.750 --> 37:27.458
Help!

37:33.791 --> 37:35.416
Help!

37:37.625 --> 37:39.416
Help!

38:55.333 --> 38:56.291
Dad?

39:02.500 --> 39:04.541
You're the one who…

39:08.000 --> 39:09.875
We don't know who killed you.

39:12.458 --> 39:13.541
You were dead.

39:14.916 --> 39:18.375
And, when you woke up again,
I had no choice.

39:19.500 --> 39:20.583
I had to…

39:22.333 --> 39:23.500
For your own sake.

39:27.750 --> 39:28.875
For my sake?

39:28.958 --> 39:31.625
If you knew
what Madeleine had to go through--

39:31.708 --> 39:34.166
What does Mom have to do with this?

39:34.250 --> 39:36.958
I couldn't help Madeleine!

39:39.416 --> 39:41.666
Daddy… you're sick.

39:42.583 --> 39:46.125
Come home to the apartment,
and I'll show you.

39:46.666 --> 39:47.875
Then you'll understand

39:48.916 --> 39:49.958
that you're not

39:50.666 --> 39:52.125
what you think you are.

40:10.083 --> 40:10.916
Odd.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.916
-Have you seen my phone?
-No.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.750
-Oh, it's charging.
-I just fell asleep.

40:14.833 --> 40:17.875
If someone calls this early,
it has to be about work.

40:17.958 --> 40:19.041
It's work.

40:22.583 --> 40:24.541
Hallangen Funeral Parlor, Odd speaking.

40:26.291 --> 40:27.125
Yes.

40:28.375 --> 40:31.833
Right, a body. That's good.

40:31.916 --> 40:33.541
Just kidding, but…

40:33.625 --> 40:36.000
We'll be there. I just have to wake Dad.

40:52.666 --> 40:53.666
Live?

41:09.541 --> 41:10.500
It's Dad…

42:59.666 --> 43:03.750
