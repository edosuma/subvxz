00:32.827 --> 00:35.663
Where the hell's
my <i> Red Dawn</i> DVD?

00:35.697 --> 00:37.965
I told Steve
to alphabetize these.

00:37.999 --> 00:39.733
Oh, honey,
cut him a little slack.

00:39.768 --> 00:42.503
He just started
his first summer job.

00:42.537 --> 00:44.471
Why don't I alphabetize them?

00:44.506 --> 00:46.407
No! I asked Steve to do this.

00:46.441 --> 00:47.942
And he did a half-ass job.

00:47.976 --> 00:49.410
It may not seem important,

00:49.444 --> 00:51.912
but he needs to learn to do
everything with his full ass.

00:51.947 --> 00:52.913
(door slams)

00:52.948 --> 00:54.214
Steve, there you are.

00:54.249 --> 00:55.883
I told you
to alphabetize the DVDs.

00:55.917 --> 00:57.685
And I can't find <i> Red Dawn.</i>

00:57.719 --> 00:59.420
Dad, can I unwind for a minute?

00:59.454 --> 01:01.455
I'm walking in from
a hard day at work.

01:01.489 --> 01:02.456
Hard day?

01:02.490 --> 01:04.158
You work at a grocery store.

01:04.191 --> 01:05.726
You know
who actually works hard?

01:05.760 --> 01:06.927
Machines.

01:06.962 --> 01:08.963
Machines work non-stop
for years.

01:08.997 --> 01:10.364
I mean, take my watch.

01:10.398 --> 01:11.365
Where's my watch?

01:11.399 --> 01:12.933
You left it in the hotel room

01:12.968 --> 01:14.635
in Orlando last spring.

01:14.669 --> 01:16.537
Wow. You can go a long time

01:16.571 --> 01:19.406
without needing a watch.

01:19.441 --> 01:21.542
Dad,<i> Red Dawn</i> is right here.

01:21.576 --> 01:23.544
It just got switched
with <i> Red Sonja.</i>

01:23.578 --> 01:25.879
No, I want you to
re-alphabetize these.

01:25.914 --> 01:27.948
Switching isn't alphabetizing.

01:27.983 --> 01:29.863
What's the difference?
They're all in order now.

01:29.884 --> 01:31.552
What's the difference?!

01:31.586 --> 01:33.654
You do things the right way,
you have a good life.

01:33.688 --> 01:36.056
You do things the wrong way,
you end up riding the rails.

01:36.091 --> 01:37.291
What?

01:37.325 --> 01:39.226
Wh-What does that even mean?

01:39.261 --> 01:40.594
It means do it the right way!

01:40.629 --> 01:41.662
(groans)

01:41.696 --> 01:42.863
Now, if you'll excuse me,

01:42.898 --> 01:45.833
I have a Father of the
Year award to accept.

01:45.867 --> 01:48.302
And the Pappy goes to...

01:48.336 --> 01:51.438
(gasps)
...my man, Stan Smith.

01:55.010 --> 01:56.443
Thank you, Alan Thicke.

01:56.478 --> 01:59.613
This is amazing.

01:59.648 --> 02:00.915
Honey!

02:00.949 --> 02:03.751
I told you I'm using
the garage for my award show!

02:03.785 --> 02:05.586
Park on the street!

02:05.620 --> 02:07.721
I am so sick of this crap, Alan!

02:07.756 --> 02:10.758
You're ruining my thing!

02:13.361 --> 02:15.696
(crying)

02:15.730 --> 02:17.565
I'm sorry, it's over.

02:17.599 --> 02:18.732
But it's not you.

02:18.767 --> 02:19.833
You know that, right?

02:19.868 --> 02:20.868
It's not you.

02:20.902 --> 02:22.903
It's your body.

02:22.938 --> 02:24.572
(crying)

02:24.606 --> 02:26.173
Hey, knock that off!

02:26.208 --> 02:27.508
I'm dumping this girl,

02:27.542 --> 02:29.777
and your sad music
is making her cry.

02:29.811 --> 02:31.745
Uh, I don't think
it's the music, buddy.

02:31.780 --> 02:34.515
I do. In fact, I'm surprised
your crappy playing

02:34.549 --> 02:36.684
hasn't driven everyone
in this place to tears.

02:36.718 --> 02:37.985
Oh, yeah?
Well, why don't you come up here

02:38.019 --> 02:39.259
if you think you can do better?

02:39.287 --> 02:40.788
I don't even play guitar.

02:40.822 --> 02:42.323
But you suck so hard,
I bet I could

02:42.357 --> 02:43.657
be better than you in a week.

02:43.692 --> 02:45.459
Donald!
It's okay.

02:45.493 --> 02:46.694
Wait, if you don't play,

02:46.728 --> 02:48.863
why are you wearing a
Martin Guitar T-shirt?

02:48.897 --> 02:50.464
That's 'cause I'm
a hipster, dumbass.

02:50.498 --> 02:52.233
We pretend to be stuff.

02:52.267 --> 02:54.001
All right, Mr. Hip.

02:54.035 --> 02:55.302
Meet me back here in a week,

02:55.337 --> 02:56.704
and let's see who's better.

02:56.738 --> 02:59.039
Loser never shows his
face in here again.

02:59.074 --> 03:00.641
I'll do you one better.

03:00.675 --> 03:04.578
The loser never comes back
here even in a mask.

03:04.613 --> 03:06.480
See you in a week, Mr. Hip.

03:06.515 --> 03:08.582
See you in a week, um...

03:08.617 --> 03:09.650
Jamal.

03:09.684 --> 03:11.652
Your name's Jamal?
But you're white.

03:11.686 --> 03:12.653
So?

03:12.687 --> 03:13.921
Is this really the first time

03:13.955 --> 03:15.222
you've had this conversation?

03:15.257 --> 03:17.458
Come on, Jamal.

03:19.995 --> 03:21.395
What do you think's going on?

03:21.429 --> 03:22.630
Seems like everyone's
getting called

03:22.664 --> 03:24.231
into Bullock's office today.

03:24.266 --> 03:26.233
(crying)

03:26.268 --> 03:27.968
Uh-oh, I know that cry.

03:28.003 --> 03:29.603
Either they're
making budget cuts

03:29.638 --> 03:32.139
or all our parents got
in a car accident again.

03:32.174 --> 03:34.742
Smith?

03:34.776 --> 03:37.711
Sir, am I getting fired?

03:37.746 --> 03:39.613
(laughing):
I wouldn't say that.

03:39.648 --> 03:41.582
I'd say "sacked."

03:41.616 --> 03:44.285
Because that's more
what Austin Powers would say.

03:44.319 --> 03:47.154
I do a great Austin Powers
impression.

03:47.189 --> 03:49.290
(poor Austin Powers impression):
You're sacked, baby!

03:49.324 --> 03:51.091
But I've worked here 20 years.

03:51.126 --> 03:52.927
You're just eliminating
the position?

03:52.961 --> 03:54.829
Oh, no, what you do
is important.

03:54.863 --> 03:57.131
I just found someone
who will do it cheaper.

03:57.165 --> 03:59.600
Meet Agent Gary.

03:59.634 --> 04:01.535
Gary's a half-wit.

04:01.570 --> 04:03.637
But he only costs half as much.

04:03.672 --> 04:07.475
Gary, stop rubbing
the stapler on your pants.

04:07.509 --> 04:10.044
(sniffs)

04:10.078 --> 04:11.712
So, that's it?

04:11.746 --> 04:14.215
I'm out of a job just like that?

04:14.249 --> 04:17.384
Yup, it's pretty crazy
how life can change so quickly.

04:17.418 --> 04:20.921
Here's another example of how
life can change so quickly.

04:20.956 --> 04:22.356
(laughing)

04:22.390 --> 04:25.059
(thud, crashing)

04:25.093 --> 04:27.561
(strumming guitar)

04:27.596 --> 04:29.697
Ha-hey! Am I in time for a show?

04:29.731 --> 04:32.166
No, I challenged some dick
to a guitar duel.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.834
Now get out of here,
I need to practice.

04:33.869 --> 04:35.970
Go play in your attic
if you don't want an audience.

04:36.004 --> 04:38.639
(groans) Stairs.

04:38.673 --> 04:40.474
All right, how
hard could this be?

04:40.509 --> 04:42.510
The shape is pretty
self-explanatory.

04:45.414 --> 04:47.748
Roger, I-I thought you knew
how to play the guitar.

04:47.783 --> 04:49.116
I used to.

04:49.151 --> 04:51.585
But you know the part of your
brain that deals with music?

04:51.620 --> 04:54.955
I took some PCP and
just destroyed it.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.457
Hey, why don't you
order some DVDs

04:56.491 --> 04:58.359
from that Latin guy
with the infomercials?

04:58.393 --> 04:59.627
Lorenzo!

04:59.661 --> 05:01.395
That's genius, Hayley.

05:01.430 --> 05:03.998
Wonder how come I never
have any great ideas?

05:04.032 --> 05:06.000
I mean, could it be the PCP?

05:06.034 --> 05:07.034
Well, I don't know.

05:07.069 --> 05:08.069
Let's find out!

05:09.137 --> 05:11.906
Shoot, left my lighter
in the attic.

05:11.940 --> 05:14.575
(groans) Stairs.

05:17.079 --> 05:19.113
You know, Mr. Smith,
I'd like to give you the job.

05:19.147 --> 05:21.749
And the way you opened
an entire pack of Starbursts

05:21.783 --> 05:23.751
with your tongue
was really impressive.

05:23.785 --> 05:26.620
But I just don't think
you're qualified.

05:26.655 --> 05:29.457
But I've worked for the
CIA for the last 20 years.

05:29.491 --> 05:32.193
Yes, I see you put
that on your résumé.

05:32.227 --> 05:35.062
But it's not
on your permanent record.

05:35.097 --> 05:36.297
"Permanent record"?

05:36.331 --> 05:37.732
That's a real thing?

05:37.766 --> 05:39.300
Well, if it wasn't,
how would I know

05:39.334 --> 05:41.902
that in fifth grade you tried

05:41.937 --> 05:44.138
to get out of a math test
by putting a slice of pizza

05:44.172 --> 05:47.775
in your underwear
and saying it was your period?

05:47.809 --> 05:49.143
That's on there?!

05:49.177 --> 05:50.811
All right, first of all,
that never happened.

05:50.846 --> 05:52.446
Second of all, it was a calzone.

05:52.481 --> 05:53.714
I'm sorry, Mr. Smith.

05:53.749 --> 05:55.229
But with a permanent record
like this,

05:55.250 --> 05:57.685
no one's going to hire you.

05:57.719 --> 05:59.587
Oh, you know what it must be?

05:59.621 --> 06:02.456
My CIA work isn't on there
because it's classified.

06:02.491 --> 06:03.724
Here, talk to my boss.

06:03.759 --> 06:04.725
(line ringing)

06:04.760 --> 06:06.293
Yeah, hi, this is Shaun

06:06.328 --> 06:08.029
over at Buffalo Wild Wings
corporate.

06:08.063 --> 06:09.904
I-I'm sorry to bother you,
but I'm sitting here

06:09.931 --> 06:12.667
with a Stan Smith,
who claims he worked for you.

06:12.701 --> 06:14.802
He-he did?

06:14.836 --> 06:17.538
(laughs)
Oh, is that right?

06:17.572 --> 06:19.206
Okay.

06:19.241 --> 06:21.642
Eh, nice try, but that was
clearly one of your friends.

06:21.677 --> 06:23.644
He gave me the old
"Now that I told you,

06:23.679 --> 06:25.680
I'm gonna have to kill you"
joke.

06:27.382 --> 06:28.649
Hi, Stan.

06:28.684 --> 06:31.185
You got to stop
telling people, Stan.

06:33.722 --> 06:35.556
So according
to my permanent record,

06:35.590 --> 06:37.258
the last job I had
was in college

06:37.292 --> 06:38.626
sweeping up hair.

06:38.660 --> 06:40.761
Working at a barbershop
shows initiative.

06:40.796 --> 06:41.796
Barbershop?

06:41.830 --> 06:43.230
It was a White Castle.

06:43.265 --> 06:45.066
I finished raking
all the leaves.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.267
Did you clean the gutters?

06:46.301 --> 06:47.268
There was nothing in them.

06:47.302 --> 06:48.602
Then get a ladder and go up

06:48.637 --> 06:50.037
and stuff the leaves
in the gutters.

06:50.038 --> 06:51.272
Then clean the gutters.
But that's...

06:51.306 --> 06:52.640
They won't always be clean.

06:52.674 --> 06:54.542
You need to be prepared
for that day.

06:54.576 --> 06:56.043
Full ass, son.

06:56.078 --> 06:58.579
(sighs)
Fine, I'll do it after work.

06:58.613 --> 07:00.614
Wait, Steve, didn't you say

07:00.649 --> 07:02.750
someone got fired
at the grocery store?

07:02.784 --> 07:05.219
Stan, maybe you
could take that job.

07:05.253 --> 07:06.320
Oh, no, no, no!

07:06.355 --> 07:07.989
Uh, uh, Dad doesn't
want that job.

07:08.023 --> 07:09.323
It's-it's entry level.

07:09.358 --> 07:10.791
Well, I got to start somewhere.

07:10.826 --> 07:13.561
Yay, I don't have to get a job!

07:18.967 --> 07:22.370
Hey, Steve, did you see that
guy earlier buying condoms?

07:22.404 --> 07:24.372
And now this lady's
getting tampons.

07:24.406 --> 07:26.107
This day is crazy.

07:26.141 --> 07:29.343
I didn't know grocery
stores were so sexy.

07:29.378 --> 07:31.345
Have fun.

07:31.380 --> 07:33.714
You know that chick has sex.

07:33.749 --> 07:35.850
Dad, come on, we're working.

07:35.884 --> 07:37.218
Hey, Steve.

07:37.252 --> 07:38.753
Rick just quit.

07:38.787 --> 07:40.721
So, how would you like to be

07:40.756 --> 07:42.823
the new assistant manager?

07:42.858 --> 07:44.091
Would I?!

07:44.126 --> 07:45.760
Sir, I've got so much more

07:45.794 --> 07:47.361
workforce experience than Steve.

07:47.396 --> 07:49.463
Yeah, but Steve's
been here a month.

07:49.498 --> 07:51.899
So, Steve, here's
your huge key ring.

07:51.934 --> 07:55.236
Oh, boy, now I have access
to the teeth-whitening kits

07:55.270 --> 07:57.939
and all liquor over $40!

07:57.973 --> 07:59.540
Well, congratulations, Steve.

07:59.575 --> 08:01.208
Thanks, Dad.

08:01.243 --> 08:02.844
Now go take the pieces
of dead onion skin

08:02.878 --> 08:05.846
out of the shopping baskets.

08:05.881 --> 08:07.648
This totally blows.

08:07.683 --> 08:10.217
I worked for the CIA
for 20 years, you know.

08:10.252 --> 08:12.153
(glass breaks)

08:12.187 --> 08:15.222
SNIPER: You really got to
put a sock in it, Stan!

08:17.666 --> 08:20.534
(whistling)

08:22.971 --> 08:24.371
I don't like your tune.

08:24.406 --> 08:25.686
Now, when you're done with this,

08:25.707 --> 08:27.141
I need you to go count
the tomatoes.

08:27.175 --> 08:29.043
Geez, why are you
being so bossy?

08:29.077 --> 08:30.544
'Cause I'm your boss.

08:30.579 --> 08:31.645
Not if I quit.

08:31.680 --> 08:32.712
Yeah? You think

08:32.746 --> 08:34.215
your permanent record
looks bad now?

08:34.249 --> 08:35.416
Think how it'll look if you quit

08:35.450 --> 08:37.318
your only job in 20 years.

08:37.352 --> 08:38.452
(laughs) Quit.

08:38.486 --> 08:39.653
In your dreams.

08:40.922 --> 08:43.390
Steve, they just
delivered the butter.

08:43.424 --> 08:44.859
One of your new responsibilities

08:44.893 --> 08:46.794
is to show the baggers
how to stock it.

08:46.828 --> 08:48.462
Yes, sir. I'm on it.

08:50.232 --> 08:52.333
So, we're right behind
the butter shelves.

08:53.502 --> 08:56.303
Whoa! How long has
this place been here?

08:56.338 --> 08:58.706
Get your jaw off
the floor and start stocking.

08:58.740 --> 09:00.740
And don't let the butter sit
on the ground too long

09:00.742 --> 09:02.843
because the fridges
put out some major heat.

09:02.878 --> 09:04.879
Got it?

09:06.615 --> 09:08.015
It won't fit.

09:08.049 --> 09:10.151
You got to take it
out of the crate, dummy.

09:10.185 --> 09:11.619
Then you make it fit.

09:11.653 --> 09:12.820
Lay the butter like bricks.

09:12.854 --> 09:14.155
With the labels facing out.

09:14.189 --> 09:15.156
Got it?

09:15.190 --> 09:17.191
Yeah, I got it.

09:19.000 --> 09:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:26.902 --> 09:28.002
I earned a break.

09:28.036 --> 09:29.603
I'll be napping
in the blood pressure chair.

09:29.638 --> 09:30.838
What's this?

09:30.872 --> 09:32.673
Oh, sorry.

09:32.707 --> 09:35.109
No, start over and do it right.

09:41.149 --> 09:43.217
Oh, that poor,
mentally-disabled man.

09:43.251 --> 09:44.685
I'm not mentally disabled!

09:44.720 --> 09:47.555
Well, you don't know
how to stack butter, so...

09:52.494 --> 09:54.495
Hey, your guitar DVD came.

09:56.231 --> 09:58.265
What the hell
are you talking about?

09:58.300 --> 10:01.102
You're battling that guy in
the coffee shop in two days.

10:01.136 --> 10:02.636
Oh, my God,
that's so important to me!

10:02.671 --> 10:04.672
Quick, put it in the DVD player!

10:06.174 --> 10:07.408
Just skip to the first lesson.

10:07.442 --> 10:08.709
I don't have a lot
of time to learn.

10:08.744 --> 10:10.678
(strumming guitar)

10:10.712 --> 10:12.613
Now it is your turn.

10:12.647 --> 10:14.248
Start with the G chord,

10:14.282 --> 10:16.617
which you finger like this.

10:16.651 --> 10:17.985
(groans)
He's going too fast.

10:18.020 --> 10:19.720
I'll pause.

10:19.755 --> 10:21.022
I think I got it.

10:21.056 --> 10:22.556
Ready?
Yeah.

10:22.591 --> 10:24.625
Now strum.

10:26.762 --> 10:28.796
Aah! It's got me!

10:28.830 --> 10:30.831
(grunting)

10:32.667 --> 10:35.603
Well, I guess this
is my hand now.

10:38.140 --> 10:39.974
I hate working at that store!

10:40.008 --> 10:41.742
Steve just bosses me around.

10:41.777 --> 10:43.844
The only good thing is
that the stock boys

10:43.879 --> 10:45.179
are teaching me Spanish,

10:45.213 --> 10:47.415
so that's pretty <i>cállate gringo.</i>

10:47.449 --> 10:49.083
Dad, why on Earth
did you make me

10:49.117 --> 10:51.619
take all of our spare light
bulbs out of their boxes?

10:51.653 --> 10:54.322
Stan, is this just
to get back at Steve

10:54.356 --> 10:56.123
for bossing you around
at the store?

10:56.158 --> 10:58.292
Are you accusing me of
being vindictive, Francine?

10:58.327 --> 11:00.094
Because I will destroy you!

11:00.128 --> 11:01.462
Besides, there's a reason

11:01.496 --> 11:03.831
I'm making him do
all these things.

11:03.865 --> 11:05.745
Now take off your shoes
and sweep up that glass.

11:05.767 --> 11:07.034
Take off my shoes?!

11:07.069 --> 11:08.135
Take 'em off.

11:08.170 --> 11:10.471
Oh, you're in for it
tomorrow, mister.

11:10.505 --> 11:12.473
The regional manager's
coming for our review

11:12.507 --> 11:14.475
and I'm gonna
be busting your ass all day.

11:14.509 --> 11:15.609
I'll just call in sick.

11:15.644 --> 11:16.877
I'll tell them you're faking.

11:16.912 --> 11:18.112
And you'll get fired.

11:18.146 --> 11:19.980
Then how will you
support your woman?

11:20.015 --> 11:22.483
How will you keep her
glowing in such finery?

11:22.517 --> 11:24.452
(sighs)

11:26.054 --> 11:28.322
(strums badly)

11:28.357 --> 11:29.323
LORENZO:
That's right.

11:29.358 --> 11:30.791
Now you're getting it!

11:30.826 --> 11:32.593
No, I'm not, and there's no way

11:32.628 --> 11:34.629
I'll learn by tomorrow!

11:35.831 --> 11:37.465
Not learning fast enough?

11:37.499 --> 11:38.466
What the hell?

11:38.500 --> 11:39.467
How are you...

11:39.501 --> 11:41.002
(laughs evilly)

11:44.239 --> 11:45.206
(plays dramatic chords)

11:45.240 --> 11:46.807
I am Lorenzo.

11:46.842 --> 11:48.876
AKA Old Scratch.

11:48.910 --> 11:52.079
I can offer you a shortcut
to guitar mastery,

11:52.114 --> 11:54.882
but it comes at an ironic price.

11:54.916 --> 11:56.484
Yeah, yeah, I'll pay any price.

11:56.518 --> 11:58.786
You realize I'm the Devil
and... and you're making

11:58.820 --> 12:00.254
what is called
a Faustian bargain, right?

12:00.289 --> 12:01.722
Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
Really?

12:01.757 --> 12:03.924
'Cause you don't sound
like you understand

12:03.959 --> 12:05.259
the gravity of the ironic price.

12:05.294 --> 12:06.460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, it's fine.

12:06.495 --> 12:07.595
I mean, I really have to crush

12:07.629 --> 12:08.796
this punk at the coffee shop.

12:08.830 --> 12:10.131
He's got this stupid
little goatee...

12:10.165 --> 12:11.432
Ah! Enough!
Enough.

12:11.466 --> 12:13.334
I'm sure your
reasons are terrific

12:13.368 --> 12:15.369
if you are willing
to pay with your soul.

12:17.706 --> 12:19.006
Wait, my soul?

12:19.041 --> 12:20.675
My Kia Soul?

12:20.709 --> 12:23.010
How am I supposed to get
to my shift at Dairy Queen?

12:24.379 --> 12:25.613
Stacey, it's Roger.

12:25.647 --> 12:27.715
Hey, can you cover my
3:00 to 7:00 tonight?

12:27.749 --> 12:29.584
Oh, my soul!

12:29.618 --> 12:31.385
Never mind.

12:31.420 --> 12:33.587
Hey, are you going
to Jake's party?

12:36.124 --> 12:37.692
Tom, I gotta say.

12:37.726 --> 12:39.260
You hit a solid double here.

12:39.294 --> 12:41.028
I'm just happy to get on base.

12:41.063 --> 12:43.464
I make the baseball
references...

12:43.498 --> 12:45.499
Oh. My. God.

12:45.534 --> 12:46.500
Holy moly.

12:46.535 --> 12:48.603
Stan, what's going on?

12:48.637 --> 12:50.571
There's butter melting
all over the place!

12:50.606 --> 12:52.173
Yeah, I, uh, I could only fit

12:52.207 --> 12:53.541
one crate on the shelf.

12:53.575 --> 12:55.776
The rest is by the
refrigeration exhaust.

12:55.811 --> 12:57.778
Steve, you were
supposed to show Stan

12:57.813 --> 12:59.113
how to stock the butter!

12:59.147 --> 13:00.615
Yeah, I sure could have used

13:00.649 --> 13:01.949
some supervision on that one.

13:01.984 --> 13:02.950
Wh-What?

13:02.985 --> 13:04.285
I-I showed you!

13:04.319 --> 13:05.686
Clearly not well enough.

13:05.721 --> 13:07.888
And I'm a sponge,
I was waiting for it.

13:07.923 --> 13:09.690
This is not good, Steve.

13:09.725 --> 13:12.393
It's just lucky no one got hurt.

13:12.427 --> 13:13.427
Joshua!

13:14.296 --> 13:15.429
(screaming)

13:25.173 --> 13:26.574
(screams)

13:31.813 --> 13:32.847
I'm sorry, Steve,

13:32.881 --> 13:34.115
but I'm gonna have
to let you go.

13:34.149 --> 13:35.182
But...
No buts.

13:35.217 --> 13:37.218
Now let's have the apron.

13:38.387 --> 13:40.388
(grunts)

13:41.490 --> 13:43.691
It's always hard
to see a young boy

13:43.725 --> 13:45.059
tarnish his permanent record.

13:45.093 --> 13:46.160
Hold on.

13:46.194 --> 13:47.595
This'll be on his
permanent record?

13:47.629 --> 13:48.696
Uh, yeah.

13:48.730 --> 13:50.164
He was assistant manager

13:50.198 --> 13:52.066
and he didn't show you
how to put the butter away.

13:52.100 --> 13:53.734
That's something every employer

13:53.769 --> 13:56.304
for the rest of his life
is gonna want to know.

13:56.338 --> 13:58.673
Yeah, if he can even find a job.

13:58.707 --> 14:00.174
Oh, God!

14:00.209 --> 14:01.283
What have I done?

14:01.403 --> 14:03.566
(thunder crashes)

14:08.749 --> 14:10.402
I showed him how
to stock the butter

14:10.436 --> 14:12.370
and he did it wrong on purpose.

14:12.405 --> 14:13.605
He got me fired!

14:13.639 --> 14:15.340
But he still has his job, right?

14:15.374 --> 14:17.075
I can keep my finery?

14:17.109 --> 14:18.343
You!

14:18.377 --> 14:20.645
You have a lot of nerve
showing your face here!

14:20.680 --> 14:22.180
You're right to be mad, Steve.

14:22.215 --> 14:23.748
And it's worse than you think.

14:23.783 --> 14:25.050
I got you fired...

14:25.084 --> 14:26.952
and now it's on your
permanent record.

14:26.986 --> 14:28.820
Good lord.

14:28.855 --> 14:30.288
My future...

14:30.323 --> 14:32.257
He's gonna be
ridin' the rails, Stan!

14:32.291 --> 14:33.291
(doorbell rings)

14:35.194 --> 14:37.028
It's come to our attention!

14:37.063 --> 14:38.997
That your son's run
out of options.

14:39.031 --> 14:40.365
The Army'll take him!

14:40.399 --> 14:42.400
Get out of here,
you damn vulture!

14:44.203 --> 14:45.904
Thank you for your service.

14:53.179 --> 14:55.180
Dad, what are we doing
at your old office?

14:55.214 --> 14:56.882
Well, the CIA was able to keep

14:56.916 --> 14:59.584
my 20 years with them
off my permanent record,

14:59.619 --> 15:01.086
so they must have
access to them.

15:01.120 --> 15:03.288
Okay, but why'd
you drag me along?

15:03.322 --> 15:05.357
Well, I don't have
my badge anymore,

15:05.391 --> 15:07.025
so I need your help
getting into the building.

15:07.059 --> 15:08.760
And how am I
supposed to do that?

15:08.795 --> 15:09.861
Like this.

15:10.897 --> 15:13.765
(grunting, groaning)

15:15.168 --> 15:16.701
STEVE:
Ow!

15:16.736 --> 15:17.736
(lock clicking)

15:20.773 --> 15:22.674
Okay, I just have to log in

15:22.708 --> 15:25.010
and see how they access
the permanent records.

15:26.946 --> 15:29.281
Damn it, they already
deleted my password!

15:29.315 --> 15:31.049
Your password was one letter?

15:31.083 --> 15:33.285
Yeah, it's, like, super easy
to remember that way.

15:33.319 --> 15:35.487
Well, I guess
this was a dead end.

15:35.521 --> 15:36.588
Or...

15:36.622 --> 15:38.123
maybe we could go
to the basement,

15:38.157 --> 15:39.257
'cause that's where

15:39.292 --> 15:40.926
the Permanent Record
Department is.

15:40.960 --> 15:43.595
BULLOCK (recording):
This is Deputy Director Bullock

15:43.629 --> 15:46.431
reminding you that secrets
are meant to be kept.

15:46.466 --> 15:49.034
Now, back to the elevator music.

15:49.068 --> 15:50.969
(singing):
♪ Friday night it was late ♪

15:51.003 --> 15:52.404
♪ I was walking you home ♪

15:52.438 --> 15:54.272
♪ We got down to the gate ♪

15:54.307 --> 15:57.309
♪ And I was dreaming
of the night... ♪

16:00.146 --> 16:01.880
It's a permanent record!

16:01.914 --> 16:05.350
"Martin McGowan pretended
to pick up his dog's poop,

16:05.384 --> 16:07.786
but just grabbed at the air
and kept walking."

16:07.820 --> 16:08.787
Wow.

16:08.821 --> 16:10.021
They are on top of stuff.

16:10.056 --> 16:11.823
Come on, let's find yours.

16:15.661 --> 16:17.662
Here it is.

16:18.664 --> 16:20.232
"Fired from grocery store

16:20.266 --> 16:21.967
for incompetent management."

16:22.001 --> 16:24.136
Don't worry, we'll fix that.

16:28.875 --> 16:31.977
"And it was totally not
Steve's fault."

16:32.011 --> 16:32.978
There.

16:33.012 --> 16:34.646
Now, to spice it up.

16:34.680 --> 16:36.815
"Steve Smith lost his virginity

16:36.849 --> 16:39.117
"after a romantic candlelight
dinner on the beach.

16:39.152 --> 16:41.153
"He suggested
taking things slow,

16:41.187 --> 16:42.954
"but she was voracious,

16:42.989 --> 16:45.123
"with an unquenchable
sex-thirst.

16:45.158 --> 16:46.992
And he did a good job."

16:47.026 --> 16:48.360
Solid.

16:48.394 --> 16:49.995
Now, let's get outta here.
GUARD: Freeze!

16:51.564 --> 16:53.131
Sir, we were just
trying to repair

16:53.166 --> 16:54.466
Steve's permanent record.

16:54.500 --> 16:55.834
He shouldn't be burdened

16:55.868 --> 16:57.628
for the rest of his life
for something I did.

16:57.637 --> 16:59.304
Well, that's the system.

16:59.338 --> 17:01.206
And when I send this downstairs,

17:01.240 --> 17:03.709
you'll be a virgin again,
Master Smith.

17:03.743 --> 17:06.044
You're in charge of
the permanent records?

17:06.079 --> 17:07.878
I play many roles here.

17:07.914 --> 17:10.882
I also design
the company softball shirts.

17:12.984 --> 17:15.119
It came to me in a dream.

17:15.154 --> 17:18.123
Daddy, the bombs came.

17:18.156 --> 17:20.224
It's C-4,
Gary,

17:20.259 --> 17:21.626
and I am not your father.

17:21.661 --> 17:23.161
What about the detonators?

17:23.195 --> 17:24.529
They came, too.

17:24.564 --> 17:27.132
I put them in the bombs
so Gary wouldn't lose them.

17:27.165 --> 17:29.134
Did you set the timer on these?!

17:29.168 --> 17:31.036
Uh-huh, Gary
making oatmeal.

17:31.070 --> 17:33.505
Almost ready.
(ticking)

17:33.539 --> 17:35.841
Good God, you're gonna
blow up this office!

17:35.875 --> 17:39.044
We've got to get
this C-4 out of here!

17:39.078 --> 17:40.545
Uh-oh!

17:42.715 --> 17:44.049
Steve, throw me more bricks.

17:44.083 --> 17:45.417
It's just like the butter!

17:45.451 --> 17:47.819
Oh, yeah!

17:49.422 --> 17:50.389
Go, Dad!

17:57.864 --> 17:59.531
(explosion, glass shattering)

17:59.565 --> 18:00.532
Yay!

18:00.566 --> 18:01.933
Oatmeal time!

18:01.968 --> 18:03.268
Gary, you're fired!

18:03.302 --> 18:05.504
Stan, you got your job back.

18:05.538 --> 18:07.673
Thank you for saving
our lives, Smith.

18:07.707 --> 18:09.341
Well, actually, you
should be thanking Steve.

18:09.375 --> 18:12.010
I was only able to
stack the C-4 so fast

18:12.045 --> 18:13.478
because Steve was so hard on me

18:13.513 --> 18:14.479
at the grocery store.

18:14.514 --> 18:16.081
Oh. Well-well,
I just did that

18:16.115 --> 18:18.283
because you were such
a jerk to me at home.

18:18.318 --> 18:20.285
I'm not trying to
be a jerk, Steve.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.788
I'm trying to save you from
a life of ridin' the rails.

18:22.822 --> 18:24.890
Dad, that's just an expression.

18:24.924 --> 18:26.591
Tell that to Tony Lura.

18:26.626 --> 18:28.327
He half-assed
it all summer

18:28.361 --> 18:29.661
on the grill at White Castle.

18:29.696 --> 18:31.797
A lot of people got
really sick, actually.

18:31.831 --> 18:33.298
Then he just disappeared.

18:33.333 --> 18:34.800
Last anyone saw of him,

18:34.834 --> 18:36.401
he was hoppin' the
Union Pacific Line

18:36.436 --> 18:38.236
with all of his
possessions in a sock.

18:38.271 --> 18:39.538
Oh.

18:39.572 --> 18:41.840
Well, thanks for
looking out for me, Dad.

18:41.874 --> 18:44.276
I sure wouldn't want
to end up like Tony Lura.

18:44.310 --> 18:45.911
No, you wouldn't, son.

18:45.945 --> 18:47.779
And, son, that's why

18:47.814 --> 18:49.781
you don't want to end up
like Stan Smith,

18:49.816 --> 18:52.818
the White Castle employee
who did everything right.

18:52.852 --> 18:54.052
'Cause what did it get him?

18:54.087 --> 18:56.555
A government job
fighting for so-called freedom

18:56.589 --> 18:58.824
from the confines of a cubicle.

18:58.858 --> 19:01.293
Well, this is my cubicle!

19:01.327 --> 19:03.195
(train horn blares)

19:03.229 --> 19:06.098
And this is real freedom!

19:06.132 --> 19:07.766
You understand, son?

19:09.535 --> 19:10.669
Yep.

19:10.703 --> 19:14.339
The world is our oyster!

19:19.679 --> 19:22.180
(acoustic guitar playing)

19:24.150 --> 19:27.386
(applause) They're
clapping 'cause it's over.

19:29.122 --> 19:31.123
(playing "Classical Gas")

20:00.253 --> 20:02.254
♪ ♪

20:29.849 --> 20:31.516
You get the drift, I win.

20:31.551 --> 20:33.185
(applause, cheering)

20:33.219 --> 20:36.255
Listen, buddy, you clearly won,
but I really need this gig.

20:36.289 --> 20:38.390
I tell you what-- you
seem like a nice guy.

20:38.424 --> 20:40.092
What if I let you
keep playing here

20:40.126 --> 20:42.094
and you just cover
the price of my lessons?

20:42.128 --> 20:43.729
That'd be amazing!

20:43.763 --> 20:45.497
Then it's a deal.

20:45.532 --> 20:47.533
(screaming)
