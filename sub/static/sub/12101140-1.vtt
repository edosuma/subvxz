WEBVTT

00:22.777 --> 00:23.610
- Good morning, Edward.

00:23.610 --> 00:27.650
You are 103 miles from
your point of origin.

00:27.650 --> 00:30.560
I am reaching the boundaries
of my operating range.

00:30.560 --> 00:31.970
My apologies.

00:31.970 --> 00:33.930
- Dammit, all right.

00:33.930 --> 00:37.150
Yeah, there's a platform
coming up on the left.

00:37.150 --> 00:38.200
I'll walk from there.

01:21.390 --> 01:24.800
It's a gas, me playing
murder police at my age.

01:24.800 --> 01:25.960
My tender years were spent

01:25.960 --> 01:28.560
as grease monkey to Babbage Boxes.

01:28.560 --> 01:32.113
But here we were, trying to
Sherlock the perfect murder.

01:32.980 --> 01:37.393
- Wait. Wait!

02:29.700 --> 02:30.536
- Again.

02:30.536 --> 02:31.460
- It's like talking
to a piece of coffee cake.

02:31.460 --> 02:32.850
- Bringing the
brain back online, Carter.

02:32.850 --> 02:33.860
- Worked like a champ yesterday.

02:33.860 --> 02:35.410
- We want the gray matter. Again!

02:35.410 --> 02:36.560
- You own my every where, Edward.

02:36.560 --> 02:37.393
You own my every when.

02:37.393 --> 02:38.950
- We ripped your
black S.O.L. right out

02:38.950 --> 02:41.250
the top of your skull,
every bit of you is ours.

02:41.250 --> 02:42.160
- We need to own
your every why, Carter.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.789
- Only you can
tell us why you've done

02:43.789 --> 02:44.680
what you've done.
- I didn't do anything.

02:44.680 --> 02:45.560
- We know your head is spinning.

02:45.560 --> 02:46.420
You've been through the ringer.

02:46.420 --> 02:47.640
- Dorothy's come back to Kansas.

02:47.640 --> 02:48.960
- There are worms under my skin

02:48.960 --> 02:50.620
with sandpaper eyes.
- Tangle Withdrawal.

02:50.620 --> 02:52.180
- Welcome back to
the ol' black and white.

02:52.180 --> 02:53.090
- But it's inhumane.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.580
- It's the very
definition of humane.

02:54.580 --> 02:56.490
This is what human feels
like. You don't remember?

02:56.490 --> 02:57.870
- Concrete facts, the sooner

02:57.870 --> 02:58.703
you'll feel better.
- Concrete.

02:58.703 --> 03:00.060
- Blue zone taxi
dropped you at the corner

03:00.060 --> 03:00.980
of Park and-
- Park and Echo.

03:00.980 --> 03:02.065
- Park.
- Park and Echo Park.

03:02.065 --> 03:02.940
- Next to the Obelisk.

03:02.940 --> 03:03.773
- No overlays.
- Sorry,

03:03.773 --> 03:05.490
the boathouse, the boathouse,

03:05.490 --> 03:07.560
which no one has laid
eyeballs on in two years.

03:07.560 --> 03:08.393
- We see it regular.

03:08.393 --> 03:10.570
- I went east, east-
- East, is it?

03:10.570 --> 03:11.403
- West, I meant west.

03:11.403 --> 03:12.236
- Was it west or east?

03:12.236 --> 03:13.530
- I went west into the park.
- Are you sure?

03:13.530 --> 03:15.490
- Yes, I went west into the park

03:15.490 --> 03:16.890
and then I stopped at the fountain.

03:16.890 --> 03:18.800
I wiped the fountain with my handkerchief.

03:18.800 --> 03:19.830
- Which hand?

03:19.830 --> 03:20.663
- What?

03:20.663 --> 03:21.880
- On the fountain?

03:21.880 --> 03:22.870
- My right.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.470
Turn the knob and then I sipped.

03:25.470 --> 03:26.400
- How many swallows?

03:26.400 --> 03:27.233
- Are you kidding?

03:27.233 --> 03:28.470
- Just warming
up the synapses, Carter.

03:28.470 --> 03:29.340
- I don't know, four?

03:29.340 --> 03:32.060
- Seven swallows. 16
seconds slurp, slurping.

03:32.060 --> 03:33.747
- Okay. And then I headed toward-

03:33.747 --> 03:34.843
- You were thirsty?

03:34.843 --> 03:36.080
- I guess?

03:36.080 --> 03:37.350
- I thought the
Tangle had cured thirst.

03:37.350 --> 03:38.400
- I know when to drink, I like the feeling

03:38.400 --> 03:39.688
on my tongue.
- He knows when to drink.

03:39.688 --> 03:40.577
It's a miracle of modern-
- Eddie.

03:40.577 --> 03:41.410
- Bunny.

03:41.410 --> 03:45.240
- I went to the pier and then
I looked out at Echo Lake.

03:45.240 --> 03:46.073
- No.
- Yes.

03:46.073 --> 03:47.230
- You took a beat on the lawn.

03:47.230 --> 03:48.063
- I did?

03:48.063 --> 03:48.950
- Stop screwing with us!

03:48.950 --> 03:49.783
- I don't remember!

03:49.783 --> 03:51.270
- Then remember!

03:51.270 --> 03:53.850
- Okay, I paused on the lawn

03:53.850 --> 03:55.650
and then I went lake-ward.
- No!

03:55.650 --> 03:56.700
- Yes.
- Again!

03:56.700 --> 03:59.170
- Car dumps me on the corner
of Park and Echo Park.

03:59.170 --> 04:00.440
I head west into the park.

04:00.440 --> 04:01.483
I stop at the water fountain.

04:01.483 --> 04:03.620
With my right hand, I turn the knob.

04:03.620 --> 04:04.457
I drink seven swallows --

04:04.457 --> 04:06.130
- Before you drink.

04:06.130 --> 04:08.660
- I, uh, I, I wiped off the fountain.

04:08.660 --> 04:09.570
- Why?

04:09.570 --> 04:10.403
- Germs.

04:10.403 --> 04:11.236
- Germs?

04:11.236 --> 04:12.130
- Habit.

04:12.130 --> 04:13.840
- I have three
years of your behavior.

04:13.840 --> 04:16.210
Macro, micro, dramatic, mundane.

04:16.210 --> 04:17.490
No hint of a clean freak.

04:17.490 --> 04:18.770
- Old habit from before.

04:18.770 --> 04:20.190
- Just kicked in again?
- Maybe you're playing

04:20.190 --> 04:21.023
for time, Carter?

04:21.023 --> 04:22.407
- I used to be a germophobe from before.

04:22.407 --> 04:23.350
- Not when we knew you.

04:23.350 --> 04:24.800
- Long time ago when I was a kid.

04:24.800 --> 04:25.683
- Maybe you
were loitering a little.

04:25.683 --> 04:26.960
- Just a nervous habit.

04:26.960 --> 04:27.870
- You were nervous?

04:27.870 --> 04:28.940
- No.
- Why were you nervous?

04:28.940 --> 04:30.170
- I wasn't nervous!
- You were excited.

04:30.170 --> 04:31.160
- No!
- You were looking

04:31.160 --> 04:31.993
for someone.
- No.

04:31.993 --> 04:33.480
- Again!
- You took all this!

04:33.480 --> 04:35.580
I could've told you the
length of every breath,

04:35.580 --> 04:38.020
the breadth of every step,
now you simply want me

04:38.020 --> 04:39.640
to just-
- Yes, yes, yes, we do!

04:39.640 --> 04:42.400
Your actual brain to your actual mouth

04:42.400 --> 04:44.420
via the vibration of actual space

04:44.420 --> 04:46.213
to my actual ear.

05:05.690 --> 05:06.523
- Why am I here?

05:07.710 --> 05:09.420
- Hazard a guess.

05:09.420 --> 05:12.023
- I haven't the faintest
shred of a wisp of a clue.

05:13.010 --> 05:14.037
- Really?

05:19.970 --> 05:21.220
- Is Cleopatra all right?

05:22.240 --> 05:23.920
- Why do you ask about Cleopatra?

05:23.920 --> 05:26.890
- Is she kosher? Is she a-okay?

05:26.890 --> 05:28.310
- Actually, she may be why you're here.

05:28.310 --> 05:29.237
- That's right, Carter.

05:29.237 --> 05:31.000
You wanna help your friend,

05:31.000 --> 05:32.980
we need every crumb of
sense we can vacuum up

05:32.980 --> 05:34.210
from your Tangle-addled brain.

05:34.210 --> 05:35.043
- Is something wrong

05:35.043 --> 05:36.480
with Cleo?
- You talk, we'll drive.

05:36.480 --> 05:37.870
- Echo Park and Park.

05:37.870 --> 05:39.420
I head west into the park.

05:39.420 --> 05:41.730
Water fountain,
handkerchief in right hand.

05:41.730 --> 05:42.860
I wipe off the fountain.

05:42.860 --> 05:44.420
Handkerchief back in pocket.

05:44.420 --> 05:47.650
I bend over. Right hand on knob, I twist.

05:47.650 --> 05:49.960
I drink. Seven swallows, apparently.

05:49.960 --> 05:52.060
16 seconds. I stand back up.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.620
I head towards the old
pier. I pause, I...!

05:58.235 --> 05:59.790
- Go ahead.

05:59.790 --> 06:01.110
- I reach into my pocket.

06:01.110 --> 06:02.930
I grab my lucky key chain and rub it

06:02.930 --> 06:04.467
between my thumb and forefinger.

06:04.467 --> 06:07.120
- The brain,
the brain, it's alive.

06:07.120 --> 06:08.550
This?
- Yeah.

06:08.550 --> 06:09.450
- Why?

06:09.450 --> 06:10.283
- Habit.

06:10.283 --> 06:11.450
- You got a lot of habits.

06:11.450 --> 06:12.840
- What were you looking at?

06:12.840 --> 06:13.990
- Nothing.

06:13.990 --> 06:16.660
- I'm looking at your lying eyes.

06:16.660 --> 06:17.493
- Why were you in the park?

06:17.493 --> 06:20.680
- Just going for a walk. A constitutional.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.580
To feel my hips roll over my
knees like I did as a kid.

06:23.580 --> 06:24.413
- It's a lie.

06:24.413 --> 06:25.510
- To gawk at the Obelisk.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.490
- The boathouse.
- To crick my neck back

06:27.490 --> 06:30.050
and gaze as the pyramidal
tower disappeared

06:30.050 --> 06:31.870
into a rose and golden sky.

06:31.870 --> 06:32.703
- Carter.

06:32.703 --> 06:35.680
- To Kodak the moment. I hadn't
seen it since the election.

06:35.680 --> 06:36.513
- Is it beautiful?

06:36.513 --> 06:37.346
- No sightseeing, Bunny.

06:37.346 --> 06:40.150
- It was a giant geyser,
then the world's tallest oak

06:40.150 --> 06:41.717
six elections in a row.

06:41.717 --> 06:42.890
Now it's the Obelisk,

06:42.890 --> 06:44.570
and yes, it is beautiful.

06:44.570 --> 06:45.403
- Carter!

06:45.403 --> 06:48.900
- 15 times larger than the
Luxor Obelisk in Paris.

06:48.900 --> 06:49.733
- Who is this?

06:50.700 --> 06:51.730
- The paperweight?

06:51.730 --> 06:52.760
- Who is it right here?

06:52.760 --> 06:55.060
- That's a device called a paperweight.

06:55.060 --> 06:56.650
Belonged to my grandfather, actually.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.910
- It's a single Caucasian
woman, 40 years old,

06:58.910 --> 07:00.190
employed as a Tangle technician

07:00.190 --> 07:01.600
for three years, who is it?

07:01.600 --> 07:02.433
- You tell me. I don't know.

07:02.433 --> 07:04.610
- Well, you looked in her
direction three times.

07:04.610 --> 07:06.650
She moves, you stop
drinking, you follow her.

07:06.650 --> 07:07.540
- I don't know.

07:07.540 --> 07:09.790
- She stops, you stop, or
you pull out your key chain.

07:09.790 --> 07:10.780
You look directly at her.

07:10.780 --> 07:11.613
- There were a lot of people in that park.

07:11.613 --> 07:13.150
I looked at all sorts.

07:13.150 --> 07:14.720
- So distortion of your eyeballs,

07:14.720 --> 07:17.660
0.3 millimeters, which
means you were focused

07:17.660 --> 07:19.150
6.3 meters in front of you.

07:19.150 --> 07:22.310
She was standing exactly
6.3 meters in front of you.

07:22.310 --> 07:23.500
- Why were you looking at her, Carter?

07:23.500 --> 07:24.620
- I have no legal obligation-

07:24.620 --> 07:25.453
- What?

07:25.453 --> 07:26.340
- I have no legal obligation,

07:26.340 --> 07:28.110
okay?
- You have no legal anything!

07:28.110 --> 07:28.943
I don't see any briefcases here.

07:28.943 --> 07:30.700
- I don't have to tell you anything!

07:30.700 --> 07:32.950
- She says, "Cleo," she turns and looks

07:32.950 --> 07:34.777
in your direction, you look at each other.

07:34.777 --> 07:36.080
"Cleo," she says.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.440
- You already know who she was, obviously.

07:38.440 --> 07:39.360
- Obviously.

07:39.360 --> 07:40.200
- So who was she?

07:40.200 --> 07:41.080
- Carter, we just need-

07:41.080 --> 07:44.020
- I don't know. I knew
someone would be there.

07:44.020 --> 07:44.853
But I didn't know who.

07:44.853 --> 07:46.880
I knew she'd be wearing
some kind of kimono,

07:46.880 --> 07:47.920
but I don't know who actually-

07:47.920 --> 07:48.753
- Kimono?

07:48.753 --> 07:50.020
- Margot signed you a flat, raw deal.

07:50.020 --> 07:51.027
Anyone would wanna lay wood on her.

07:51.027 --> 07:52.720
- You're so very understanding.

07:52.720 --> 07:53.553
- Good cop.

07:53.553 --> 07:54.470
- You know I fought for you.

07:54.470 --> 07:55.820
- Can we not talk about Margot?

07:55.820 --> 07:56.970
Can we just not?

07:56.970 --> 07:58.360
- Your neck is already noosed.

07:58.360 --> 07:59.220
You're already dangling.

07:59.220 --> 08:01.710
Our job isn't to nail you.
You're already nailed.

08:01.710 --> 08:04.520
- I am answering all of your questions.

08:04.520 --> 08:08.053
- So you weren't following Margot Foster?

08:09.200 --> 08:12.035
- Margot? This?

08:15.010 --> 08:18.100
- This is three bodies
in a real room, Carter.

08:18.100 --> 08:20.540
And this sweaty body, this
biological being here,

08:20.540 --> 08:21.970
Edward Banderas, you used to know it.

08:21.970 --> 08:22.940
Do you savvy?

08:22.940 --> 08:25.740
You remember how I don't
stop until I get what I want?

08:25.740 --> 08:27.920
I knew Margot. Margot knew me.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.890
Margot put me on Cleopatra's radar.

08:29.890 --> 08:30.970
Margo knew what was what.

08:30.970 --> 08:34.850
Margot carried the weight of
the world on her shoulders!

08:34.850 --> 08:37.190
And if you think I'm not gonna scrub

08:37.190 --> 08:40.660
every lie off you until I get
to the shiny truth you have,

08:40.660 --> 08:42.323
Margot was my friend!

08:44.800 --> 08:47.518
- Was? Is Margot?

08:51.317 --> 08:52.817
- Yeah. Margot is.

08:56.810 --> 08:59.283
We're the world's most
expensive babysitters,

09:00.350 --> 09:01.793
licensed euthanizers.

09:03.120 --> 09:05.480
Our agency is a secret
working group hidden deep

09:05.480 --> 09:08.800
within the folds of the Federal
Communications Commission.

09:08.800 --> 09:13.700
We call it the A.S.P, The
Army of Simple Purity.

09:13.700 --> 09:15.177
It's a joke.

09:20.097 --> 09:20.930
- Murder?

09:20.930 --> 09:22.350
- 23 minutes as the crow flies

09:22.350 --> 09:23.800
after you left her in the park.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.570
- And you are prime suspect number one

09:25.570 --> 09:27.120
most wanted violent and dangerous

09:27.120 --> 09:28.530
extreme caution warranted.

09:28.530 --> 09:30.120
- Well, there hasn't been
a murder since the Tangle.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.020
The violence overrides-

09:31.020 --> 09:32.730
- Where'd you go after the park?

09:32.730 --> 09:34.730
- Cooled my heels on Hill Street.

09:34.730 --> 09:36.910
- There's no record of that on
the Tangle, is there, Bunny?

09:36.910 --> 09:38.575
- No, Eddie, there isn't.

09:38.575 --> 09:39.408
- What?

09:39.408 --> 09:41.390
- You vanish from the Tangle at 10:32

09:41.390 --> 09:43.110
in an elevator in the Ritz Building.

09:43.110 --> 09:44.540
You pop back up on our radar

09:44.540 --> 09:46.330
at a recycling chute on Daisy

09:46.330 --> 09:48.913
three blocks away, 23 minutes later.

09:49.820 --> 09:51.640
You disappeared for 23 minutes.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.990
- During those 23 minutes,
Margot met her maker.

09:53.990 --> 09:55.253
Two blocks south.

09:57.050 --> 09:59.473
- That's impossible. All of it.

10:04.390 --> 10:07.583
I think... I'm thirsty.

10:09.020 --> 10:10.010
- I'll pour you a glass.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.540
- She'll get you some
water. I'll drown you in it.

10:11.540 --> 10:12.793
- Edward, Laurel.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.510
You know I wouldn't.

10:16.510 --> 10:17.490
- You wouldn't?

10:17.490 --> 10:19.130
- Of course not.

10:19.130 --> 10:20.220
- I'm really asking.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.140
- You think I'd off Margot?

10:22.140 --> 10:23.640
- Didn't she cut out your heart?

10:23.640 --> 10:26.330
- With a spoon and threw it on the coals.

10:26.330 --> 10:27.520
- You're over it?

10:27.520 --> 10:30.200
- No. I'm not over it.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.470
I was banished. She took Cleo from me-

10:32.470 --> 10:34.330
- So you didn't wanna
take Margot's pale skin,

10:34.330 --> 10:35.163
hold it to the flame,

10:35.163 --> 10:36.700
and make a pale fire of her life?

10:36.700 --> 10:38.020
I might have if I were you.

10:38.020 --> 10:40.130
- It's all pale fire now.

10:40.130 --> 10:43.280
We were born into sunlight,
we proceed in moonlight.

10:43.280 --> 10:44.900
- Ah, the poet returns.

10:44.900 --> 10:46.700
- It was poetry that made Cleopatra.

10:46.700 --> 10:47.710
- Poetry made nothing.

10:47.710 --> 10:49.160
It could've been owner's manuals

10:49.160 --> 10:50.980
to old food processors
for all it mattered.

10:50.980 --> 10:52.060
You made it poetry.

10:52.060 --> 10:53.870
- Margot did what she did.

10:53.870 --> 10:57.040
She was who she was, may she R-I-P.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.750
I didn't even blame her for it.

10:58.750 --> 11:00.000
Anyway, I couldn't have killed her

11:00.000 --> 11:00.833
even if I wanted to.

11:00.833 --> 11:02.720
- Because of the violence overrides.

11:02.720 --> 11:04.870
- We are all benevolently infected

11:04.870 --> 11:06.170
with turn-the-other-cheek.

11:06.170 --> 11:08.933
- And yet my friend is
missing most of her face.

11:14.940 --> 11:15.790
- What's it like?

11:17.380 --> 11:19.030
- What?

11:19.030 --> 11:21.663
- Does it feel good? Do you feel trapped?

11:22.750 --> 11:23.583
- What?

11:23.583 --> 11:25.640
- The overrides, the Tangle in your blood,

11:25.640 --> 11:27.150
in your muscles, in your head.

11:27.150 --> 11:29.250
- She's a little obsessed
with our forbidden fruit.

11:29.250 --> 11:30.083
- Forbidden?

11:30.083 --> 11:33.540
- What's it like to fear
no hurt? To feel no pain?

11:33.540 --> 11:35.590
- How do you not know what it feels like?

11:39.660 --> 11:42.863
Okay, the overrides are like a reflex.

11:43.810 --> 11:46.550
You know this, right? A
pre-programmed arc, okay?

11:46.550 --> 11:48.920
You scope a snake under
your toe, you jump, right?

11:48.920 --> 11:51.510
Immediately. Reflex takes over.

11:51.510 --> 11:54.180
The Tangle just adds
another layer of reflex.

11:54.180 --> 11:56.050
I go to touch a hot stove. I can't.

11:56.050 --> 11:58.130
The Tangle swerves my hand away.

11:58.130 --> 12:00.850
I trip. The Tangle rolls me to safety.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.620
It's why we don't need
to feel pain anymore.

12:02.620 --> 12:04.120
The Tangle protects us instead.

12:04.120 --> 12:06.920
I go to strike someone,
my arms would freeze.

12:06.920 --> 12:10.840
It would be impossible for
I or anyone to kill someone.

12:10.840 --> 12:12.810
- So you're a Google car.

12:12.810 --> 12:15.030
- Your heart beats without
you thinking about it, right?

12:15.030 --> 12:15.863
No different.

12:15.863 --> 12:17.060
- If you had to, how would you get around

12:17.060 --> 12:18.740
the overrides, Carter?

12:18.740 --> 12:19.573
- I have no idea.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.330
- You're an unusually intelligent person.

12:21.330 --> 12:22.920
- And he's the micro-intelligence expert.

12:22.920 --> 12:26.370
Ask Mr. Nanobot. I'm the poet, remember?

12:26.370 --> 12:28.280
I don't know. Get off Tangle, I guess?

12:28.280 --> 12:30.240
- Which you did. 23 minutes off Tangle.

12:30.240 --> 12:33.570
- As far as I know, only
Cleopatra groks the microdrones.

12:33.570 --> 12:34.460
- That's what I said.

12:34.460 --> 12:35.680
- Yes, I know, Edward.

12:35.680 --> 12:38.470
- So did Cleopatra
turn off your overrides

12:38.470 --> 12:40.262
so you could kill Margot Foster?

12:40.262 --> 12:41.095
- What?

12:41.095 --> 12:43.440
- Did she send little signals
to our microscopic pals,

12:43.440 --> 12:44.610
tell them to stand down

12:44.610 --> 12:46.850
so you could put a crater
in your enemy's forehead?

12:46.850 --> 12:48.433
- I didn't kill Margot.

12:50.568 --> 12:52.068
- We don't have time for this.

12:55.314 --> 12:56.190
- We're the proverbial mother

12:56.190 --> 12:57.940
with the baby under the Volkswagen.

13:00.460 --> 13:02.170
- The Tangle is to the internet

13:02.170 --> 13:04.670
what the HAL 9000 is to the abacus.

13:04.670 --> 13:07.370
The old-style internet,
the good old triple-w,

13:07.370 --> 13:10.200
connected computer terminals
all over the world.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.540
Then came the Internet of Things,

13:12.540 --> 13:15.550
light bulbs and thermostats,
our cars, our coffee-makers,

13:15.550 --> 13:17.690
our pacemakers, our parking meters.

13:17.690 --> 13:20.140
Everything we make connected
together in a weave.

13:21.129 --> 13:23.819
Then Cleo created the Tangle.

13:23.819 --> 13:26.630
The Tangle connects the
trillion-trillion-fold swarm

13:26.630 --> 13:28.430
of quantum-entangled microdrones,

13:28.430 --> 13:31.430
semi-intelligent nanobots,
that fill the earth,

13:31.430 --> 13:33.673
air, water, blood, and sinew.

13:34.670 --> 13:36.230
Within days of the Tangle's launch,

13:36.230 --> 13:37.533
the world had transformed.

13:38.500 --> 13:41.720
Everyone 3D-printed a
hard drive, their S.O.L.,

13:41.720 --> 13:44.370
Secure On-Tangle Line, grew it right

13:44.370 --> 13:47.010
in their cerebral cortex, and synced up,

13:47.010 --> 13:48.893
instant access to the whole world.

13:49.830 --> 13:52.010
You could count the moles
on the back of a Sherpa

13:52.010 --> 13:54.780
on Everest from your couch.

13:54.780 --> 13:57.120
You could count the hairs on the mole.

13:57.120 --> 13:59.731
You could count the mites on the hair.

14:07.830 --> 14:09.830
Sometimes normal rules don't apply.

14:09.830 --> 14:11.430
- What rules?

14:11.430 --> 14:14.013
- You know. Moral rules.

14:19.580 --> 14:20.413
- Eddie!

14:21.290 --> 14:23.080
- Your problem right now, and
I can see it in your eyes,

14:23.080 --> 14:24.690
is you don't believe I'll hurt you.

14:24.690 --> 14:25.810
We're old friends, right?

14:25.810 --> 14:27.490
- Chums of the highest order.

14:27.490 --> 14:29.828
- We don't have time for this.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.420
- Why were you in the park, Carter?

14:33.420 --> 14:34.253
- No reason.

14:34.253 --> 14:35.430
- Let me explain something.

14:35.430 --> 14:36.670
You don't know how to lie anymore.

14:36.670 --> 14:38.600
You have no avatar to hide behind.

14:38.600 --> 14:39.710
You're in a prisoner's dilemma.

14:39.710 --> 14:42.100
You and your face, but
your face is gonna squawk,

14:42.100 --> 14:43.120
so you better talk.

14:43.120 --> 14:44.290
- I was on a gig.

14:44.290 --> 14:45.123
- What kind of a gig?

14:45.123 --> 14:45.956
- It's confidential.

14:45.956 --> 14:46.872
- Okay.

14:50.610 --> 14:53.100
Someone hires you to follow Margot Foster

14:53.100 --> 14:54.570
and she winds up dead.

14:54.570 --> 14:56.200
- Carter, were you hired to follow Margot?

14:56.200 --> 14:58.250
- Either you killed her
or whoever hired you did.

14:58.250 --> 15:00.110
Neither one looks too
good pinned to your chest.

15:00.110 --> 15:01.310
- How do you not know who killed her?

15:01.310 --> 15:03.473
The entire world's a searchable database!

15:03.473 --> 15:04.306
- Oh yeah, what about us,

15:04.306 --> 15:05.360
what about the Cleopatra Squad?

15:05.360 --> 15:07.430
Didn't you ever wonder why you
couldn't find us on Tangle?

15:07.430 --> 15:08.920
- I never gave you a second thought,

15:08.920 --> 15:09.753
Edward.
- All right.

15:09.753 --> 15:10.586
- Cleo, I looked for Cleo,

15:10.586 --> 15:11.820
but I wasn't surprised she found a way

15:11.820 --> 15:12.653
to hide from the Tangle.

15:12.653 --> 15:14.090
- She hides the way way we do.

15:14.090 --> 15:16.430
The murder took place in
a space like this one.

15:16.430 --> 15:18.470
This is a technology saferoom,

15:18.470 --> 15:21.020
nano-impermeable, one
one entrance, airlocked.

15:21.020 --> 15:23.380
We breathe, eat, shit, and
work in boxes like this.

15:23.380 --> 15:25.610
Grounded spaceships, totally off Tangle.

15:25.610 --> 15:27.460
- A silent mote in a storm screaming.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.732
- A blind spot in the
ever-illuminated world.

15:29.732 --> 15:30.880
- No Tangle.

15:30.880 --> 15:33.510
- Only the phone connects us
to the Tangle. Untraceable.

15:33.510 --> 15:36.470
Everything in here is
pre-singularity technology.

15:36.470 --> 15:37.770
Well, pre-triple-w.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.210
- And the two of you?

15:39.210 --> 15:40.640
- Mr. and Mrs. Clean.

15:40.640 --> 15:44.465
- Chit chat, chitty, chitty,
chit chat, chit chat!

15:44.465 --> 15:47.210
- I swear on a stack of babies

15:47.210 --> 15:50.127
and Barbies, I do not know who killed her.

15:50.127 --> 15:51.727
- But you do know who hired you.

15:52.596 --> 15:53.429
So come on!

15:55.020 --> 15:57.040
- Eddie, he's talking.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.000
- Is he?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.660
- You're talking, right?

15:59.660 --> 16:02.100
So some John hired you
to find some other John.

16:02.100 --> 16:04.460
Was Margot the John that
some John hired you to find?

16:04.460 --> 16:06.860
Was your client looking for Margot?

16:06.860 --> 16:08.440
Was Margot, was that paperweight

16:08.440 --> 16:10.153
the person you were looking for?

16:12.240 --> 16:13.490
She was wearing a kimono.

16:14.520 --> 16:18.516
Was it the kimono? The one
you were hired to find?

16:23.510 --> 16:24.810
Did you kill Margot?

16:24.810 --> 16:25.740
- No.

16:25.740 --> 16:26.700
- Did you kill her?

16:26.700 --> 16:27.570
- No!

16:27.570 --> 16:28.403
- Who did?

16:28.403 --> 16:29.340
- I don't know.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.232
- Let him up, Goebbels!

16:38.572 --> 16:40.530
- My shoulder! You punter!

16:40.530 --> 16:41.700
- I said let him up!

16:41.700 --> 16:43.280
- One half hour after you make Margot

16:43.280 --> 16:44.640
in the park and she makes you,

16:44.640 --> 16:46.020
she is face-up on Infinity

16:46.020 --> 16:47.550
and you were ghosted from the Tangle.

16:47.550 --> 16:48.890
- Stop it, Edward!
- It was you, wasn't it?

16:48.890 --> 16:51.180
It was you and Cleo,
right? The durable duo.

16:51.180 --> 16:53.170
- Shut up!
- Cleo got wind of the A.S.P.

16:53.170 --> 16:54.560
She couldn't tell friend from foe,

16:54.560 --> 16:56.250
so she reaches out to her old nanny

16:56.250 --> 16:57.450
and helpmeet to cut off the head

16:57.450 --> 16:58.390
of the snake.
- A.S.P.

16:58.390 --> 16:59.743
Tell me you didn't-
- Of course we did!

16:59.743 --> 17:01.530
Yes, we did.

17:01.530 --> 17:02.990
Only you of all people couldn't

17:02.990 --> 17:04.110
understand why-
- She deserves a-

17:04.110 --> 17:06.200
- If she started murdering
people, wouldn't you

17:06.200 --> 17:07.117
want a way to stop her?
- She cannot murder-

17:07.117 --> 17:08.880
- Margot banished you

17:08.880 --> 17:11.010
so that we could put a leash on Cleopatra.

17:11.010 --> 17:12.090
- Stop it!

17:12.090 --> 17:12.989
- Get off me.

17:26.847 --> 17:29.203
Answer the ringer. She
knows who we have here.

17:35.890 --> 17:39.533
- Laurel. Lucky lotto 7-14-21-35-42 --

17:40.580 --> 17:43.123
Yes, yes, he's here.

17:45.300 --> 17:47.530
- Cleopatra hired you to
kill Margot, didn't she?

17:47.530 --> 17:48.715
- Cleo cannot-

17:53.420 --> 17:54.770
- You're not allowed, Cleo.

17:56.370 --> 17:57.203
I know, but.

17:58.423 --> 18:00.071
But the rules were written,
and so it is written.

18:02.894 --> 18:03.727
- Is that?

18:03.727 --> 18:06.110
- Yes, that is, she is
in charge of the probe,

18:06.110 --> 18:08.360
which is strange casting, if you ask me.

18:08.360 --> 18:11.230
- We're working on it. Not yet.

18:11.230 --> 18:12.300
- If we don't get straight answers,

18:12.300 --> 18:15.000
you're gonna be a floater
in the L.A. River, Carter.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.820
And she's gonna be next.

18:16.820 --> 18:18.850
- Okay! Okay, I'll talk!

18:21.690 --> 18:22.610
One condition.

18:22.610 --> 18:24.390
- You're not negotiating from a position

18:24.390 --> 18:25.420
of strength.
- One thing!

18:25.420 --> 18:26.730
- What?
- You know what.

18:26.730 --> 18:27.563
- Speak!

18:27.563 --> 18:28.510
- You know!

18:31.210 --> 18:32.313
- Cleopatra's not allowed to-

18:32.313 --> 18:35.510
- I don't care.

18:35.510 --> 18:36.343
- What?

18:53.610 --> 18:56.320
She recalled the
microdrones. Did the audit.

18:56.320 --> 18:57.590
Everything we have on Margot.

18:57.590 --> 19:01.451
Zilch, nada, 40-love, no
ghosts went into that room.

19:01.451 --> 19:02.284
- So she says.

19:03.282 --> 19:04.115
But if the ghosts were her ghosts,

19:04.115 --> 19:04.948
she wouldn't tell us, would she?

19:04.948 --> 19:06.490
You didn't tell her about this?

19:06.490 --> 19:07.710
- No, of course not.

19:07.710 --> 19:09.920
You start from the
assumption that I'm stupid.

19:09.920 --> 19:11.530
- You're a whole onion smarter than me,

19:11.530 --> 19:12.363
I've always known that.

19:12.363 --> 19:14.463
I act accordingly. What about him?

19:16.704 --> 19:17.870
- Let him up.

19:17.870 --> 19:19.080
She's doing that audit now,

19:19.080 --> 19:21.680
but he wasn't at the
speakeasy, ghost suit or not.

19:21.680 --> 19:22.980
- Well, someone had to be there.

19:22.980 --> 19:23.813
It can't be a coincidence.

19:23.813 --> 19:24.646
- Edward.

19:26.640 --> 19:27.473
- What?

19:29.260 --> 19:30.900
- She gave us until five.

19:30.900 --> 19:31.820
- Gave us?

19:31.820 --> 19:33.720
- She said this is an emergent situation.

19:33.720 --> 19:36.030
She said she's coming in here at five

19:36.030 --> 19:37.310
if we don't have answers.

19:37.310 --> 19:40.590
- She said she's co -- how?

19:40.590 --> 19:41.852
- That gives us three hours.

19:46.750 --> 19:47.583
- Hm.

19:51.700 --> 19:53.140
We have to turn the keys.

19:53.140 --> 19:54.490
First, she hacks the NSA stacks-

19:54.490 --> 19:55.840
- We never told-
- Listen!

19:55.840 --> 19:57.070
We hid the stacks for a reason.

19:57.070 --> 19:58.660
Now she knows about the A.S.P.

19:58.660 --> 20:00.100
And we did tell her she
couldn't come in here.

20:00.100 --> 20:02.069
These are our rooms. And
now she's coming here.

20:02.069 --> 20:03.320
- We have until five.

20:03.320 --> 20:05.640
And anyway, we need a third
agent to turn the keys.

20:05.640 --> 20:07.680
- Well, I'll ring Francesca.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.000
- Of course. Francesca.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.233
- We need an unapologetic dirty dancer.

20:12.280 --> 20:14.040
- Let him up already!

20:14.040 --> 20:15.510
What is wrong with you?

20:15.510 --> 20:17.343
- I'm an incorrigible torturer.

20:28.587 --> 20:31.128
- Why thank you, Edward.

20:31.128 --> 20:31.961
- You're welcome.

20:36.999 --> 20:38.200
- Barefoot as the surf comes in.

20:38.200 --> 20:40.400
Every wave sinks us deeper, more deeply

20:40.400 --> 20:43.540
into an ever settling
and unsettling footprint.

20:43.540 --> 20:47.590
This world, this paradise,
this perfect place,

20:47.590 --> 20:51.010
this panel above pain,
this plane of permission,

20:51.010 --> 20:55.020
this, this Tangle-life
is harder to understand

20:55.020 --> 20:57.830
every next moment than it is every this.

20:57.830 --> 21:00.340
Never the same breath to breath.

21:00.340 --> 21:02.170
Whole skyscrapers funneled away

21:02.170 --> 21:04.593
only to be replaced when
you turn back around.

21:05.460 --> 21:08.350
Election is the warp and woof,

21:08.350 --> 21:11.780
national, city, school,
homeowner's elections,

21:11.780 --> 21:15.340
elections held
metronomically, automatically,

21:15.340 --> 21:19.170
your wish and whim uploaded in real time.

21:19.170 --> 21:22.340
A universe rebuilt on choice,

21:22.340 --> 21:25.580
the height, color, consistency of the sky,

21:25.580 --> 21:26.843
the texture of the air,

21:28.270 --> 21:29.263
the taste of being.

21:30.240 --> 21:31.813
Everything attuned to fantasy.

21:33.460 --> 21:37.210
Yet somehow, we keep up
the ancient soap opera.

21:37.210 --> 21:39.600
Love me, love me, love me.

21:39.600 --> 21:42.100
King of the hill. Deceit and desperation.

21:42.100 --> 21:44.870
Every level of pain removed from the body

21:44.870 --> 21:46.980
only makes the next level of discomfort

21:46.980 --> 21:50.600
the last one still uncured
even more unbearable.

21:50.600 --> 21:54.380
It's an Arms Race between
nuclear-level palliatives

21:54.380 --> 21:57.320
and the endless ingenuity of desperation,

21:57.320 --> 21:59.833
dissatisfaction, and expectation.

22:00.860 --> 22:04.150
It's a world ever-fighting
the last second's war.

22:04.150 --> 22:06.537
Perfect for what we
wanted a half-step back.

22:06.537 --> 22:08.920
But the constant flux undoes itself.

22:08.920 --> 22:13.070
A world that adjusts to your
every desire makes you fickle.

22:13.070 --> 22:15.930
Fickleness increases the
speed of the adjustments,

22:15.930 --> 22:17.730
which increases your fickleness

22:17.730 --> 22:20.200
until it all just hums in a state

22:20.200 --> 22:23.450
of flickering disconnected images

22:23.450 --> 22:26.393
tied together by unsatisfactoriness.

22:27.478 --> 22:29.290
- What is going on with you?

22:29.290 --> 22:30.340
- What?

22:30.340 --> 22:33.150
- This is our nine to
five, Edward. And a 911.

22:33.150 --> 22:34.890
- I know that. What do
you think I'm doing?

22:34.890 --> 22:36.690
- I stand here without the foggiest.

22:36.690 --> 22:37.790
- Not your job, clearly.

22:37.790 --> 22:38.705
- Okay, excuse me,

22:38.705 --> 22:39.920
but I have a grilling to get grilling.

22:39.920 --> 22:42.210
- Maybe it's a little too
close to home for you.

22:42.210 --> 22:44.260
- Margot? It's not close to home?

22:44.260 --> 22:45.930
You're colder than Cleo.

22:45.930 --> 22:46.860
- It doesn't matter.

22:46.860 --> 22:47.693
- What?

22:47.693 --> 22:49.350
- It doesn't matter that it was Margot.

22:49.350 --> 22:50.183
- OK, don't talk to me like-

22:50.183 --> 22:52.400
- If Cleo did this, then we're next,

22:52.400 --> 22:53.730
and we have three hours.

22:53.730 --> 22:55.430
- I know that. What do you
think we're talking about?

22:55.430 --> 22:58.080
- If Cleo did this, then
our job is a comic book one.

22:58.080 --> 22:59.530
- I know that!

22:59.530 --> 23:00.430
- Margot.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.080
Anything you wanna tell me, Superman?

23:04.080 --> 23:05.290
- What is eating your grape?

23:05.290 --> 23:07.330
We're on the same side, Sally.

23:07.330 --> 23:08.850
- Nothing.

23:08.850 --> 23:12.340
Then punch the clock and keep
your feelings to yourself.

23:12.340 --> 23:13.350
- What?

23:13.350 --> 23:14.623
- It's disgusting.

23:21.980 --> 23:25.250
All right, Carter. Sorry about my partner.

23:25.250 --> 23:27.000
- Oh, it's no skin off my nose.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.700
He's an old friend of mine, right?

23:32.120 --> 23:33.570
- He is passionate, isn't he?

23:35.000 --> 23:36.250
- Maybe. I can't be sure.

23:37.580 --> 23:39.520
- You don't think he crossed the line?

23:39.520 --> 23:42.743
- Well, I, I didn't get the whole story.

23:57.820 --> 23:59.650
- Look at this.

23:59.650 --> 24:00.483
- What's this?

24:05.489 --> 24:08.033
Crabs on a cracker.

24:10.880 --> 24:11.713
Margot?

24:15.010 --> 24:16.733
Repeated impact to the face.

24:19.820 --> 24:20.830
- You're one of the few people

24:20.830 --> 24:22.550
who might've had the technical ability

24:22.550 --> 24:25.640
to kill Margot and you had the motivation.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.030
You can understand the suspicion.

24:27.030 --> 24:29.620
- I'm not the who that done it.

24:29.620 --> 24:30.580
- Who did?

24:30.580 --> 24:32.160
- Naturalists, maybe?

24:32.160 --> 24:34.010
- Maybe. Philosophical
pacifists, though.

24:34.010 --> 24:35.410
- Yeah, they are all off the Tangle.

24:35.410 --> 24:36.870
- Well, they don't use the
Tangle, but they're on it.

24:36.870 --> 24:38.610
- Some of them do daily X-rays

24:38.610 --> 24:40.270
to eliminate the microdrones.

24:40.270 --> 24:41.985
- Then they're immediately infected again.

24:41.985 --> 24:43.760
- That's a good point.

24:43.760 --> 24:44.750
- Anyway, they have no S.O.L.,

24:44.750 --> 24:46.130
so nothing they do's encrypted.

24:46.130 --> 24:47.330
They have no secrets.

24:47.330 --> 24:48.867
- You a naturalist, Carter?

24:48.867 --> 24:51.110
- Oh, I'm a Tangle lover, Edward.

24:51.110 --> 24:52.943
Cleo wove it for me, after all.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.474
She still in the Watchtower?

24:56.474 --> 24:57.307
- Yeah.

24:57.307 --> 24:59.310
- Is it locked down, sealed
up, watched, and warded?

24:59.310 --> 25:01.180
Whoever killed Margot might want Cleo.

25:01.180 --> 25:02.500
- It's still hidden away, Carter.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.763
The guards don't even know
what they're guarding.

25:06.910 --> 25:09.360
- He said he thought I killed
Margot on Cleo's orders.

25:09.360 --> 25:11.570
- Yeah, Margot strongly supported

25:11.570 --> 25:13.580
relieving Cleo of some
of her responsibilities.

25:13.580 --> 25:15.590
- A separation of powers kind of thing.

25:15.590 --> 25:16.760
- What powers?

25:16.760 --> 25:17.700
- Most of them.

25:17.700 --> 25:20.310
Too much dependent on one mind
and one will is dangerous.

25:20.310 --> 25:21.750
- She's the
best mind, the best will-

25:21.750 --> 25:23.700
- Look, in less than 140,

25:23.700 --> 25:26.180
Cleo had a motive to kill Margot.

25:26.180 --> 25:27.790
You and Cleo both with motives,

25:27.790 --> 25:29.380
old friends with motives,

25:29.380 --> 25:32.980
old friends with unique
capabilities with motives.

25:32.980 --> 25:34.895
- You never understood Cleopatra.

25:34.895 --> 25:36.853
- You always said that.

25:38.500 --> 25:40.283
Only you grokked Cleopatra,

25:41.460 --> 25:43.400
yet she's never surprised me once.

25:43.400 --> 25:45.500
- Door was deadbolted with the chair

25:45.500 --> 25:47.750
secured under the door.

25:47.750 --> 25:49.500
- Yeah, we had to bust the door down.

25:49.500 --> 25:50.820
- Why would she barricade the door?

25:50.820 --> 25:51.670
- Maybe she didn't.

25:51.670 --> 25:54.160
Maybe the killer didn't
wanna be interrupted.

25:54.160 --> 25:57.100
- All this evidence strongly
suggests that she was alone.

25:57.100 --> 25:58.770
- All this evidence but her dead body.

25:58.770 --> 25:59.970
We're missing something.

26:01.327 --> 26:02.510
- What's with the radiation wear?

26:02.510 --> 26:06.030
- Margot was a field agent,
the only one of us on Tangle.

26:06.030 --> 26:07.640
That's called a ghost suit.

26:07.640 --> 26:08.830
It's invisible to the Tangle,

26:08.830 --> 26:11.070
it's our out-on-the-town dresswear.

26:11.070 --> 26:14.180
Nano-impermeable, so
we don't get infected.

26:14.180 --> 26:16.620
- You wear one of these,
you drop off Tangle?

26:16.620 --> 26:19.310
- The suit generates a
static algorithmic field.

26:19.310 --> 26:21.410
It neutralizes the microdrones.

26:21.410 --> 26:23.410
Wherever we go, microdrones report

26:23.410 --> 26:24.730
empty space to the Tangle.

26:24.730 --> 26:26.390
- But it's visible to the eye.

26:26.390 --> 26:28.320
- Who uses their naked eyes anymore?

26:28.320 --> 26:29.620
- So you wear one of these,

26:29.620 --> 26:31.060
and you can walk through the city

26:31.060 --> 26:34.150
in plain view and no
one knows you're there.

26:34.150 --> 26:35.940
- Real world's 404, don't you know?

26:35.940 --> 26:38.090
It's like a Buick on a turnpike.

26:38.090 --> 26:41.030
- Wait, Margot was on Tangle,

26:41.030 --> 26:42.690
why would she need one of these suits?

26:42.690 --> 26:44.320
- Well, she had
to wear the ghost suits

26:44.320 --> 26:47.440
in the saferoom so the
saferooms remained safe.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.710
She was ridden with intelligent germs.

26:49.710 --> 26:51.060
- She took off the helmet.

26:51.060 --> 26:52.397
There's no damage to that at all.

26:52.397 --> 26:54.383
- No, she wouldn't do that voluntarily.

26:55.320 --> 26:58.830
It set off the alarm when the
microdrones infected the room.

26:58.830 --> 27:02.493
- Wait. What's the murder weapon?

27:04.190 --> 27:06.010
- Corner of the table.

27:06.010 --> 27:07.490
- 'Scuse me?

27:07.490 --> 27:09.910
- The killer smashed
her face into the corner

27:09.910 --> 27:11.700
of the table with great accuracy.

27:11.700 --> 27:14.763
The autopsy concludes seven to ten blows.

27:16.159 --> 27:16.992
- Well.

27:18.330 --> 27:20.940
So much for my suicide hypothesis.

27:32.420 --> 27:34.600
- In the beginning,
there were just five of us,

27:34.600 --> 27:36.363
a nicely balanced pentagon.

27:37.310 --> 27:39.030
We had all worked at big tech companies.

27:39.030 --> 27:41.660
We'd all gotten sick of reporting upwards.

27:41.660 --> 27:45.570
Cleo and Margot found each
other and then Margot found us.

27:45.570 --> 27:47.300
We formed a tech collective of sorts.

27:47.300 --> 27:49.780
We cashed out our options,
put it all in a big bucket,

27:49.780 --> 27:52.510
and rented a warehouse in
the Old Fashion District,

27:52.510 --> 27:57.373
just the five of us: me, Laurel,
Carter, Margot, and Cleo.

27:58.712 --> 28:00.130
There was nothing about Cleo
that would have made you

28:00.130 --> 28:02.470
suspect she was gonna be the one.

28:02.470 --> 28:04.610
She wasn't a beauty, that's for sure.

28:04.610 --> 28:08.370
She wasn't the smartest or
deepest or most knowledgeable.

28:08.370 --> 28:11.600
But of all of us, in
fact, more than any human

28:11.600 --> 28:14.440
I've ever met, she was capable of looking

28:14.440 --> 28:18.313
into her own architecture to
see the flaws and then adjust.

28:19.440 --> 28:20.730
Once we got her the right resources,

28:20.730 --> 28:22.920
we just had to get out of the way.

28:22.920 --> 28:24.042
And not get crushed.

28:35.824 --> 28:37.720
Why are you letting our
suspect peruse the case files?

28:37.720 --> 28:39.780
- We're computer
scientists, Edward.

28:39.780 --> 28:41.830
Maybe he can help. He's
a private investigator.

28:41.830 --> 28:44.220
- A snoop, a
private dick, a gumshoe.

28:44.220 --> 28:46.370
- In a world where everyone
knows everything about everyone.

28:46.370 --> 28:48.650
- Eh, it's a silly rabbit job these days,

28:48.650 --> 28:49.870
but we don't know everything.

28:49.870 --> 28:51.980
Everyone has a S.O.L. QT on the DL.

28:51.980 --> 28:52.920
- You don't.

28:52.920 --> 28:54.367
- Not anymore, thank you.

28:54.367 --> 28:55.570
- And we don't.

28:55.570 --> 28:57.510
- Just human beings as Darwin intended.

28:57.510 --> 28:58.610
- Why?

28:58.610 --> 29:00.210
- Someone has
to be off Tangle, Carter.

29:00.210 --> 29:01.270
- Why?

29:01.270 --> 29:03.160
- What if the Tangle
gets infected by a virus?

29:03.160 --> 29:04.770
- Every S.O.L. is quantum-encrypted,

29:04.770 --> 29:07.650
firewalled, entangled to one
and only one consciousness,

29:07.650 --> 29:08.483
impossible to hack.

29:08.483 --> 29:10.930
- Yeah, for now. Technology changes.

29:10.930 --> 29:13.220
- And people let people pass
their firewalls all the time.

29:13.220 --> 29:14.290
- Lovers, mainly.

29:14.290 --> 29:16.690
- Yeah, and sex has never
spread a virus before.

29:17.550 --> 29:19.020
- You're naturalists.

29:19.020 --> 29:20.230
- Well, this was the one condition

29:20.230 --> 29:22.820
for letting Cleo let
loose the microdrones.

29:22.820 --> 29:24.570
- Someone has to watch the watcher.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.810
- When you and Margot
rounded up the Squad,

29:50.810 --> 29:54.950
it was Eden on Earth, at least to me.

29:54.950 --> 29:57.740
Edward was an artist with nanotech,

29:57.740 --> 29:59.180
Laurel built neural nets

29:59.180 --> 30:01.970
as clearly as programming language,

30:01.970 --> 30:05.750
and Margot, she had a magic Poppins bag.

30:05.750 --> 30:07.800
Anything we needed just popped right out.

30:09.160 --> 30:12.283
You and I were friends.
And you needed that.

30:13.553 --> 30:16.140
You would have gone
nowhere without a friend.

30:16.140 --> 30:17.723
And I needed that.

30:19.130 --> 30:22.540
'There was a time when
meadow, grove, and stream,

30:22.540 --> 30:25.880
the earth and every common sight

30:25.880 --> 30:29.540
to me did seem appareled
in celestial light.'

30:34.310 --> 30:36.280
I know you speak the same language as me

30:36.280 --> 30:38.243
because I taught you that language.

30:39.597 --> 30:41.263
But we speak the same language.

30:44.040 --> 30:47.583
No one will ever hear
you the way that I can,

30:49.924 --> 30:52.910
and no one will ever hear
me the way that you do.

30:56.473 --> 30:57.520
A husband comes to me.

30:57.520 --> 30:59.860
His wife is diddling in holes and corners

30:59.860 --> 31:01.455
behind his back on the Tangle, you know,

31:01.455 --> 31:02.980
because she couldn't do it anywhere else.

31:02.980 --> 31:04.200
He doesn't know who.

31:04.200 --> 31:06.650
Doesn't have anything,
but she's growing distant,

31:06.650 --> 31:09.130
she doesn't seem the
same, she doesn't notice

31:09.130 --> 31:10.620
his new overlay, whatever.

31:10.620 --> 31:13.093
So I snoop around and I get paid.

31:16.400 --> 31:19.897
- How do you get past
the firewall into the S.O.L.?

31:19.897 --> 31:21.983
- Uh, you can't get past the firewall.

31:23.040 --> 31:25.880
Your hard drive is the
most private technology

31:25.880 --> 31:27.630
ever invented, a little bit of your S.O.L.

31:27.630 --> 31:29.850
in steel, graphene, and buckyballs.

31:29.850 --> 31:31.720
- I know that. I half invented it.

31:31.720 --> 31:32.723
- Sorry, it's just my spiel.

31:32.723 --> 31:34.230
- I don't need your spiel.

31:34.230 --> 31:37.336
Why do they hire you if you
can't get past the firewall?

31:37.336 --> 31:41.180
- Uh, people give themselves
away in other smaller ways.

31:41.180 --> 31:42.510
Mutterings in their sleep,

31:42.510 --> 31:44.030
uh, the magic name of their lover

31:44.030 --> 31:46.610
causing dilation of their pupils,

31:46.610 --> 31:48.990
uh, their palms to sweat,
their heart to race,

31:48.990 --> 31:51.340
sub-vocalization while
they're talking on the Tangle,

31:51.340 --> 31:52.910
a twitch in the throat,

31:52.910 --> 31:57.910
a hint of a grunt that the
Tangle can pick up and analyze.

31:57.970 --> 32:00.250
I cross-reference that
with potential lovers

32:00.250 --> 32:02.020
and their reactions and so on.

32:02.020 --> 32:05.700
It's tedious, but no bits or
bytes are ever actually lost.

32:05.700 --> 32:07.280
You just have to have the patience

32:07.280 --> 32:08.975
to put Humpty together again.

32:16.070 --> 32:17.580
- I didn't know this would happen.

32:17.580 --> 32:18.970
- Okey doke.

32:18.970 --> 32:20.530
- So you didn't off Margot?

32:20.530 --> 32:22.678
- No. I told you I didn't.

32:22.678 --> 32:25.239
- Well, you had a ghost
suit, an opportunity, motive.

32:25.239 --> 32:26.320
- So did you.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.920
- We're going to crash
the world, do you hear me?

32:31.050 --> 32:33.716
- Is that what you mean by turn the keys?

32:36.170 --> 32:37.190
- Francesca's en route.

32:37.190 --> 32:38.330
- Francesca?

32:38.330 --> 32:41.930
- She's A.S.P. original,
good cop, bad cop,

32:41.930 --> 32:44.723
and Francesca, genocidal cop.

32:45.580 --> 32:47.540
- You're gonna wanna talk
before she gets here.

32:47.540 --> 32:49.790
- I said I'd answer your questions.

32:49.790 --> 32:51.260
- Who hired you?

32:51.260 --> 32:53.350
- I don't know. Call wasn't traceable.

32:53.350 --> 32:55.090
- So maybe it was Cleo.

32:55.090 --> 32:57.380
- Anyone can make an untraceable call.

32:57.380 --> 32:58.570
- So maybe it was Cleo.

32:58.570 --> 33:01.640
- Why go in person? Why not
just track Margot on Tangle?

33:01.640 --> 33:04.840
- I have certain tools that
only work in local environments.

33:04.840 --> 33:06.680
The microdrones measure a lot,

33:06.680 --> 33:07.750
but they don't catch everything.

33:07.750 --> 33:08.583
- The key chain.

33:08.583 --> 33:11.700
- The key chain allows me
to read quantum fluctuations

33:11.700 --> 33:13.350
on the edge of the S.O.L. in the brain.

33:13.350 --> 33:14.600
- So you can read minds?

33:14.600 --> 33:17.080
- No, but to some degree of certainty,

33:17.080 --> 33:20.130
I can tell when someone has
begun an encrypted connection,

33:20.130 --> 33:22.560
some emotional content.

33:22.560 --> 33:24.990
- So, what'd you sniff out?

33:24.990 --> 33:28.620
- I remember her being excited, Margot,

33:28.620 --> 33:32.170
in the park, just before she got a call,

33:32.170 --> 33:34.480
happy, even, I, I can't say for certain,

33:34.480 --> 33:39.480
but maybe the beginnings
of romantic excitement.

33:40.640 --> 33:42.140
- Romantic excitement.

33:42.140 --> 33:44.160
- Sexual stimulation. Lust.

33:44.160 --> 33:45.287
- She's waiting for a lover, then?

33:45.287 --> 33:46.552
- Eh, maybe.

33:46.552 --> 33:48.920
It's an art, not a science,

33:48.920 --> 33:51.493
because right after the connection,

33:51.493 --> 33:54.000
the excitement slowly changed

33:54.000 --> 33:57.470
into something more muted, more serious.

33:57.470 --> 33:59.490
She started sub-vocalizing on the Tangle,

33:59.490 --> 34:01.200
which is a bad habit, but good for me.

34:01.200 --> 34:02.450
It allowed me, actually,

34:02.450 --> 34:04.960
to catch her half of the conversation.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.420
- We have it.

34:06.420 --> 34:07.253
- Yeah?

34:10.280 --> 34:11.680
- Do you remember it?

34:11.680 --> 34:12.513
- Not really.

34:13.690 --> 34:15.730
- She begins, "Cleo?"

34:15.730 --> 34:17.550
Then she looks in your direction,

34:17.550 --> 34:20.290
then she says, "Yes, yes. I'm here."

34:20.290 --> 34:22.457
She turns, she starts to walk away.

34:22.457 --> 34:25.397
"I'm peachy-keen. You
peachy-keen?" she says.

34:25.397 --> 34:28.010
"The speakeasy? Five minutes."

34:28.010 --> 34:30.220
Whoever called her sent
her to the speakeasy.

34:30.220 --> 34:32.590
Whoever called her got her to
the room where she was killed.

34:32.590 --> 34:33.860
- And she says 'Cleo.'

34:33.860 --> 34:34.870
- Yeah.

34:34.870 --> 34:36.110
- Well, maybe I'm simple-minded,

34:36.110 --> 34:39.000
but that suggests that maybe
she was talking to Cleo.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.960
- But would Margot ask Cleo
if she were peachy-keen?

34:42.960 --> 34:44.050
- Sarcasm, maybe?

34:44.050 --> 34:47.940
- No. What did your client want?

34:47.940 --> 34:49.340
You said you'd answer our questions.

34:49.340 --> 34:50.700
What did your client want from you?

34:50.700 --> 34:53.800
What did they hire you to do?

34:53.800 --> 34:54.913
- Go ahead.

34:57.810 --> 35:00.020
- I don't know what game we're playing.

35:00.020 --> 35:01.630
I don't know the trumps.

35:01.630 --> 35:03.030
I don't know the wild cards.

35:04.540 --> 35:05.830
- Go ahead.

35:05.830 --> 35:06.763
- Go ahead what?

35:07.600 --> 35:09.250
Yeah, go ahead, Carter, go ahead.

35:10.830 --> 35:13.623
- Okay. The kimono.

35:14.630 --> 35:17.200
My client wanted to know who would have

35:17.200 --> 35:20.220
a black and gold Sashi Brothers' kimono.

35:20.220 --> 35:22.230
My client suspected it might be

35:22.230 --> 35:26.060
for a lover, an overlay for an avatar.

35:26.060 --> 35:29.360
I had a serial number.
I had a gift receipt.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.303
I traced the kimono in meatspace

35:31.303 --> 35:33.270
and tracked the owner to Echo Park,

35:33.270 --> 35:36.060
and that owner was Margot Foster.

35:36.060 --> 35:36.893
- Stop talking.
- What?

35:36.893 --> 35:38.623
- Shut your flapping trap!

35:44.170 --> 35:47.853
- You are a cheap graphic novel, Edward.

35:49.760 --> 35:50.713
I followed you,

35:51.620 --> 35:54.210
watched you search a public terminal,

35:54.210 --> 35:56.160
put some weight on a low-level nobody

35:56.160 --> 35:59.203
in the Sashi Company,
gave up the serial number.

36:00.470 --> 36:02.407
- So look who has a motive now.

36:02.407 --> 36:04.330
- Give me a Kit Kat.

36:04.330 --> 36:07.020
I didn't suspect it was Margot
until she turned up dead.

36:07.020 --> 36:08.690
Margot, of all people?

36:08.690 --> 36:11.590
And I didn't know it was Margot
until Carter just said it.

36:13.870 --> 36:15.570
I could say you have a motive, too.

36:16.537 --> 36:18.530
- And what would that be?

36:18.530 --> 36:19.453
- Lovers' tiff.

36:20.430 --> 36:22.290
- Well we weren't lovers.

36:22.290 --> 36:23.920
- No?

36:23.920 --> 36:25.770
- How could we be? She was on Tangle.

36:26.770 --> 36:28.720
- You're gonna stand on a technicality?

36:31.050 --> 36:34.223
- Yes. Yes, we were intimate.

36:35.210 --> 36:36.503
She and I could talk.

36:38.089 --> 36:38.922
- Great.

37:10.898 --> 37:12.648
- Who is it?

37:13.685 --> 37:14.518
Who is it?

37:16.806 --> 37:18.750
- Oh, you
moron, open the door!

37:18.750 --> 37:19.870
- Francesca?

37:19.870 --> 37:21.860
- Open the door, Edward!

37:21.860 --> 37:22.947
What's going on in there?

37:22.947 --> 37:24.620
- Are you alone?

37:24.620 --> 37:28.620
- No, I'm with Cleopatra riding her horse

37:28.620 --> 37:31.730
and Godzilla and the Queen of Sheba.

37:31.730 --> 37:33.429
Open the blasted door!

37:58.200 --> 37:59.200
- Francesca!

38:23.876 --> 38:24.709
Francesca.

40:01.453 --> 40:04.670
- So judging by the epic
wussiness being perpetrated

40:04.670 --> 40:06.500
and lack of demonstrable brotherhood

40:06.500 --> 40:08.950
and sisterhood on the
part of my mates in arms,

40:08.950 --> 40:10.380
I'm guessing you already
told 'em everything,

40:10.380 --> 40:11.820
Carter Carmine, am I right?

40:11.820 --> 40:14.923
You gave up the ghost?
Turned friendly for the Feds?

40:16.870 --> 40:18.834
Ratted out the ratatouille?

40:46.673 --> 40:48.256
So what do we have?

41:28.720 --> 41:31.235
- Private investigator Carter Carmine?

41:31.235 --> 41:34.290
- Mm, yes. Who's asking?

41:34.290 --> 41:37.360
- I'm a lonely housewife not
getting enough attention.

41:37.360 --> 41:38.850
My husband's cheating on me.

41:38.850 --> 41:42.654
- Yeah? Well, you got the right snoop.

41:42.654 --> 41:44.107
- Good.

41:44.107 --> 41:46.118
- I'm trying to send you my contract,

41:46.118 --> 41:47.186
but you're blocking it.

41:47.186 --> 41:48.636
- This is an audio line only.

41:49.920 --> 41:51.000
- Name?

41:51.000 --> 41:52.873
- No names. I'll pay you triple.

41:55.480 --> 41:56.433
- At your service.

41:57.290 --> 41:58.920
- I found a receipt.

41:58.920 --> 41:59.753
- Proceed.

41:59.753 --> 42:02.280
- For a gold and black kimono.

42:02.280 --> 42:03.690
- Maybe a gift for you?

42:03.690 --> 42:05.014
- No.

42:05.014 --> 42:06.390
- How do you know?

42:06.390 --> 42:08.935
- Before the Tangle, he
bought me a real kimono.

42:08.935 --> 42:10.474
- Maybe this one's for your avatar.

42:10.474 --> 42:14.040
- No, it's not for my
avatar. The serial number.

42:14.040 --> 42:16.070
Can you hack for whom he
bought it, who has it now?

42:16.070 --> 42:17.240
- What's the company?

42:17.240 --> 42:20.173
- Sashi Brothers Avatar Clothing Limited.

42:24.650 --> 42:26.260
- Yeah, it's crackable.

42:26.260 --> 42:28.390
If the app is ever activated,
I should be able to trace it.

42:28.390 --> 42:30.650
- If it's ever activated?

42:30.650 --> 42:31.523
- He can send the gift,

42:31.523 --> 42:34.220
but the receivee might never put it on.

42:34.220 --> 42:35.827
If she never puts it
on, it's not on Tangle.

42:35.827 --> 42:39.190
If you don't tell me who
he is, it's all I can do.

42:39.190 --> 42:41.407
If you tell me who he
is, I might do better.

42:41.407 --> 42:42.950
- No. No, that's fine.

42:42.950 --> 42:44.793
I wanna know who he sent that to.

42:46.260 --> 42:47.710
- Do you think it's someone that you know?

42:47.710 --> 42:48.823
- It's very unlikely.

42:49.700 --> 42:51.970
I don't know very many people.

42:51.970 --> 42:54.280
- My experience is that
it's oftentimes better

42:54.280 --> 42:57.140
not to know if he doesn't wanna tell you.

42:57.140 --> 42:59.054
- That's my business.

42:59.054 --> 43:01.033
- You sure it's not for you?

43:01.033 --> 43:02.693
- I don't wear overlays.

43:04.150 --> 43:05.170
- Oh?

43:05.170 --> 43:06.970
- I don't use an avatar.

43:06.970 --> 43:08.543
- You don't use an avatar?

43:09.410 --> 43:10.243
- No.

43:11.370 --> 43:12.870
- Are you a naturalist?

43:12.870 --> 43:13.970
- Something like that.

43:16.180 --> 43:19.863
- All right. What shall I call you?

43:21.080 --> 43:23.513
- What level of
confidentiality do I enjoy?

43:27.971 --> 43:32.450
- Listen, I have no mates,
no lovers, no colleagues.

43:32.450 --> 43:34.373
My only loyalty is to my clients.

43:35.250 --> 43:38.740
You have absolute 100% impenetrable

43:38.740 --> 43:42.190
unbreakable confidentiality.

43:42.190 --> 43:43.390
I'm a very loyal person.

43:44.320 --> 43:45.153
- I know.

43:46.702 --> 43:47.619
- You know?

43:48.970 --> 43:50.323
- Call me Xanadu.

43:52.073 --> 43:52.906
- Xanadu.

43:56.620 --> 43:58.870
I don't recognize your voice.

43:58.870 --> 44:00.393
- You're not hearing my voice.

44:01.540 --> 44:03.500
- I thought you said
this was an audio line.

44:03.500 --> 44:05.303
- It's a very special audio line.

44:07.750 --> 44:09.187
- I can't find you. Where are you?

44:09.187 --> 44:10.733
You're not on Tangle.

44:12.050 --> 44:13.133
- Look for a zoo.

44:14.410 --> 44:18.163
I'm the lion behind the glass
watching the meat walk by.

44:20.200 --> 44:21.500
- How shall I contact you?

44:22.400 --> 44:23.540
- Where are you?

44:23.540 --> 44:24.553
- Downtown, why?

44:25.500 --> 44:27.860
- I have a way we can meet face to face.

44:27.860 --> 44:31.607
I'd like to see a
friendly face, old friend.

44:34.235 --> 44:35.154
- All, all right.

45:53.182 --> 45:54.840
- Let me get this straight.

45:54.840 --> 45:57.820
You and Margot were trysting on the sly?

45:57.820 --> 45:58.840
- I guess.

45:58.840 --> 46:00.240
- Like a video game affair?

46:00.240 --> 46:02.763
Vype-sex, that kind of thing? Where?

46:03.925 --> 46:06.040
- I set up Vype terminals

46:06.040 --> 46:07.620
in a server farm in Chinatown.

46:07.620 --> 46:08.453
- You dumbass.

46:09.920 --> 46:11.160
The whole purpose and glue behind

46:11.160 --> 46:12.360
why we got you two married

46:12.360 --> 46:14.310
is so this pooka-pooka wouldn't happen.

46:15.210 --> 46:17.150
And you hired a Tangle-wired PI

46:17.150 --> 46:19.393
to sniff out who Edward was tangling with.

46:20.240 --> 46:22.390
Did you off Margot, Laurel?

46:22.390 --> 46:24.620
- No. What about him?

46:24.620 --> 46:25.780
- Me?

46:25.780 --> 46:27.420
- He's the one
with all the secrets.

46:27.420 --> 46:28.463
- I loved Margot.

46:30.100 --> 46:32.203
- You, you loved her?

46:34.670 --> 46:36.027
- This is an impossible conversation

46:36.027 --> 46:37.327
to have under these circumstances.

46:37.327 --> 46:39.835
- Something is wrong with you.

46:39.835 --> 46:42.650
- The one person
that agrees with me on Cleo,

46:42.650 --> 46:44.510
that's the one I'm gonna kill?

46:44.510 --> 46:45.640
- Who knows what you believe?

46:45.640 --> 46:47.350
- Everyone knows what I believe.

46:47.350 --> 46:48.820
- But you've been lying a long time.

46:48.820 --> 46:49.990
- Okay.
- I'm not the one

46:49.990 --> 46:52.979
that carries a smartphone
around in her purse.

46:52.979 --> 46:54.143
- Eh, it doesn't work.

46:55.300 --> 46:56.880
It's clean. It's just a shell.

46:56.880 --> 46:58.870
- She's obsessed with the Tangle,

46:58.870 --> 47:01.140
overlays, avatars, Vype tournaments.

47:01.140 --> 47:03.670
- We all have hobbies.
Maybe if I had a husband.

47:03.670 --> 47:04.503
- Laurel.

47:06.920 --> 47:08.320
- I have an alibi.

47:08.320 --> 47:09.153
- Okay.

47:11.315 --> 47:14.227
- Um, we, we were here. Together.

47:17.260 --> 47:18.883
- You're each other's alibi?

47:19.940 --> 47:21.750
- Cleo's been acting shady, Francesca.

47:21.750 --> 47:23.440
She's the only one that
can make the Tangle dance,

47:23.440 --> 47:24.690
she's the only one that could get someone

47:24.690 --> 47:26.550
in and out of that room
without anyone noticing.

47:26.550 --> 47:27.923
And that guy over there?

47:29.130 --> 47:30.293
He's her biggest fan.

47:33.298 --> 47:34.131
- I know.

47:35.220 --> 47:37.840
I know. The legendary wet-nurse to God.

47:37.840 --> 47:39.570
- I hired him.

47:39.570 --> 47:41.580
- Then maybe you were
his opportunity knocking.

47:41.580 --> 47:43.970
You give him a ghost suit, he uses it.

47:43.970 --> 47:45.770
- Here's what's come
down to the dog pound.

47:45.770 --> 47:48.900
Three agents, Glavine,
Cole, and Susan, are MIA.

47:48.900 --> 47:50.884
Haven't pinged Home Base in 12 hours.

47:50.884 --> 47:51.717
- What?

47:51.717 --> 47:53.440
- Margot may have just been the first.

47:53.440 --> 47:54.740
Do you all have your keys?

51:34.551 --> 51:36.030
- By the time

51:36.030 --> 51:37.823
this song ends, Carter Carmine,

51:39.030 --> 51:41.268
by the time this song ends.

51:43.099 --> 51:45.810
Or I'm gonna pour hot coffee

51:45.810 --> 51:49.110
into that hole on top of your brain case.

51:49.110 --> 51:51.171
Make a little neuronal macchiato.

51:54.370 --> 51:56.010
Did you off Margot?
- No.

51:56.010 --> 51:56.990
- Did you help Cleopatra

51:56.990 --> 51:58.157
off Margot?
- No.

51:58.157 --> 51:58.990
- Do you know who

51:58.990 --> 51:59.830
offed Margot?
- No.

51:59.830 --> 52:00.900
- Have you had any contact

52:00.900 --> 52:02.320
with Cleopatra since you bailed

52:02.320 --> 52:03.350
on the unit?
- I didn't bail.

52:03.350 --> 52:04.560
I was tossed.

52:04.560 --> 52:06.400
No! I didn't.

52:06.400 --> 52:08.630
- You took the Board line
downtown. Is that right?

52:08.630 --> 52:10.660
- What? When?

52:10.660 --> 52:12.380
- After you left Margot in the park,

52:12.380 --> 52:14.210
you took the Board line downtown.

52:14.210 --> 52:15.070
- Yeah.
- You entered

52:15.070 --> 52:16.820
the Ritz Building on Spring.
- Yep.

52:16.820 --> 52:18.790
- Meanwhile, Margot took
a car to the speakeasy.

52:18.790 --> 52:19.812
Do you know where that is?

52:19.812 --> 52:20.750
- No.

52:20.750 --> 52:21.790
- You don't?

52:21.790 --> 52:22.700
- I have an inkling.

52:22.700 --> 52:23.973
- Are you being cute?

52:29.300 --> 52:31.093
Three blocks away from
the Ritz is where it is.

52:31.093 --> 52:32.850
Is this a coincidence?

52:32.850 --> 52:34.030
- I was set up.

52:34.030 --> 52:34.863
- I don't think so.

52:34.863 --> 52:36.196
- I was set up!

52:36.196 --> 52:38.300
- That's the first verse.

52:38.300 --> 52:39.133
You wanna argue with me?

52:39.133 --> 52:41.268
- Look, I'm telling you everything I know.

52:42.300 --> 52:44.494
- You take the Ritz
elevator to the basement.

52:47.035 --> 52:50.323
In the elevator is a nano-impermeable box.

52:52.370 --> 52:54.897
The elevator begins microdrone cleanse.

53:00.110 --> 53:02.494
Then you drop off the face of the Tangle

53:02.494 --> 53:05.327
and don't reappear for 23 minutes.

53:13.458 --> 53:15.630
Second verse.

53:15.630 --> 53:18.530
- In the box was a ghost
suit. Laurel told me to hurry,

53:18.530 --> 53:21.030
so I took my S.O.L. off
Tangle and I put on the suit

53:21.030 --> 53:22.250
and I went out to Hill Street.

53:22.250 --> 53:24.020
I was told to wait for a black Pillbox

53:24.020 --> 53:25.260
long-distance transport.

53:25.260 --> 53:27.880
It never came, so I went into the alley

53:27.880 --> 53:30.920
and I dumped the suit in a
flash dump as I was told.

53:30.920 --> 53:32.970
- I wanted a face-to-face
in an A.S.P. unit,

53:32.970 --> 53:35.110
but I didn't make it.

53:35.110 --> 53:38.320
- My gut is speaking
to me in its floral way

53:38.320 --> 53:39.810
and it's telling me it's no coincidence

53:39.810 --> 53:41.150
that Carter drops off the Tangle

53:41.150 --> 53:43.560
during the 23 minutes in
which Margot was killed.

53:43.560 --> 53:46.440
- It sure looks like I
set him up, but I didn't.

53:46.440 --> 53:48.770
- Why didn't you make
your meeting, Laurel?

53:48.770 --> 53:51.020
You left your old friend
Carter high and dry.

53:52.320 --> 53:57.320
- Him. My husband, my babycakes, my alibi.

54:28.010 --> 54:33.010
'In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a
stately pleasure dome decree.

54:33.475 --> 54:35.010
Where Alph, the sacred river,

54:35.010 --> 54:37.915
ran through caverns measureless

54:37.915 --> 54:38.807
to man down to a sunless sea.'

55:07.990 --> 55:10.163
- 'Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.'

55:21.730 --> 55:22.930
- Who was that?

55:24.640 --> 55:26.030
- Thought you were at Central.

55:26.030 --> 55:29.293
- I, I made a detour. You okay?

55:30.510 --> 55:31.343
- Why?

55:32.920 --> 55:35.190
- It looks like you've
been shedding tears.

55:35.190 --> 55:37.160
- I mean why the detour?

55:37.160 --> 55:38.600
- Things make things happen.

55:38.600 --> 55:41.423
Times get shifted. Mind wanders.

55:42.580 --> 55:45.490
- Have your secrets, Laurel. I don't care.

55:45.490 --> 55:47.490
- I left the Flood file talking to Cleo.

55:48.436 --> 55:49.269
- Ah.

55:52.200 --> 55:53.033
- Tired?

55:53.940 --> 55:55.343
- Yeah, I'm just spent.

55:58.030 --> 56:00.980
- I'm no better at broaching
the unbroachable than you are.

56:02.330 --> 56:06.040
- We don't need to. What
good does it ever do?

56:06.040 --> 56:06.873
- Come on.

56:08.280 --> 56:09.180
- It's how I feel.

56:10.310 --> 56:12.610
- You can't even lift
your eyes to look at me.

56:20.080 --> 56:21.280
Who were you talking to?

56:22.813 --> 56:23.646
- Ah, Cleo.

56:24.550 --> 56:26.300
- I thought you hated Carter's poems.

56:28.470 --> 56:29.303
- She likes it.

56:32.260 --> 56:33.547
- I know this marriage
feels like something

56:33.547 --> 56:36.170
out of 18th century Japan to you.

56:36.170 --> 56:37.710
- I wanted to marry.

56:37.710 --> 56:40.230
- But you didn't have much choice.

56:40.230 --> 56:42.469
- Sure, I did. As much as you did.

56:42.469 --> 56:43.302
- That's not true.

56:43.302 --> 56:46.650
There's four women agents, nine men.

56:46.650 --> 56:49.200
- True. You had quite the
buffet to choose from.

56:49.200 --> 56:51.610
- I'm trying to tell you something.

56:51.610 --> 56:53.130
- I liked you before the A.S.P.

56:53.130 --> 56:54.183
You know that, right?

57:00.820 --> 57:03.210
- What I'm trying to get
at is that we don't have

57:03.210 --> 57:05.440
to have secrets from each other, right?

57:05.440 --> 57:08.230
Neither of us are going
anywhere. We can't.

57:08.230 --> 57:10.393
So you can tell me how you feel.

57:11.560 --> 57:12.970
I have to deal with it.

57:12.970 --> 57:13.803
- Okay.

57:17.450 --> 57:20.913
- So? Is there anything you wanna tell me?

57:23.210 --> 57:24.510
- Sometimes I feel guilty.

57:25.410 --> 57:27.842
- Guilty? About what?

57:34.120 --> 57:35.533
- So I recite her the poem.

57:36.650 --> 57:37.603
- I recite it, too.

57:39.080 --> 57:41.223
Not to her. To myself.

57:43.760 --> 57:44.870
- Why?

57:44.870 --> 57:46.450
- What did Carter say?

57:46.450 --> 57:48.720
If you can understand the soul of a poem,

57:48.720 --> 57:50.783
you can understand the soul of a man.

57:51.730 --> 57:52.823
Or a woman.

57:55.440 --> 57:57.420
- Come lie down with me.

57:57.420 --> 57:59.350
- I'm supposed to be back at Central.

57:59.350 --> 58:01.733
- So am I. We're a married couple.

58:01.733 --> 58:03.550
We deserve some privacy.

58:03.550 --> 58:04.600
- Can we do it later?

58:06.080 --> 58:08.253
- Sure thing. Bada bing, bada bing.

58:11.050 --> 58:13.627
- All right. Just a moment.

58:21.840 --> 58:24.540
- If I don't tell you
something, I have a good reason.

58:26.140 --> 58:27.603
- What does that mean?

58:30.780 --> 58:31.703
- I'm a good man.

58:33.420 --> 58:36.610
I'm on the side of the
holy and righteous, right?

58:36.610 --> 58:37.567
- Yes, you are.

58:44.173 --> 58:46.137
I find myself feeling unreal.

58:47.704 --> 58:48.537
- Unreal?

58:50.200 --> 58:53.133
- Like a character that's
been cut from a book.

58:54.672 --> 58:57.273
The story just goes on
as if I were never there.

59:00.830 --> 59:03.230
- You're not allowed to
shrug when you're Atlas.

59:04.400 --> 59:07.313
- How'd a couple hacker
geeks become Atlas?

59:09.000 --> 59:09.833
- Necessity.

59:12.490 --> 59:14.447
The whole world plays with fire

59:14.447 --> 59:16.547
and no one cares 'cause they're in Xanadu.

59:19.250 --> 59:20.880
- The world's been playing with fire

59:20.880 --> 59:22.280
since the discovery of fire.

59:38.070 --> 59:43.070
Laurel, lucky lotto 7-14-21-28-35-42-49.

59:49.900 --> 59:51.700
Something happened at the speakeasy.

59:58.071 --> 1:00:00.014
- Ding, ding, ding! Time's up.

1:00:00.014 --> 1:00:00.847
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1:00:00.847 --> 1:00:02.660
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1:00:02.660 --> 1:00:04.040
I have an idea.

1:00:04.040 --> 1:00:05.410
- Mm-hmm.
- Just wait.

1:00:05.410 --> 1:00:08.130
Edward, you called me a Google
car before, remember those?

1:00:08.130 --> 1:00:08.963
- Of course.

1:00:08.963 --> 1:00:09.960
- The old self-driving cars?

1:00:09.960 --> 1:00:10.793
- Yes.

1:00:10.793 --> 1:00:12.360
- There's still a bunch
of them on the road.

1:00:12.360 --> 1:00:14.270
They, they've been
retrofitted for the Tangle.

1:00:14.270 --> 1:00:16.690
I would bet that some of the, the cameras

1:00:16.690 --> 1:00:17.840
are still operational.

1:00:17.840 --> 1:00:18.930
- So.

1:00:18.930 --> 1:00:20.213
- The cameras, Edward!

1:00:21.160 --> 1:00:22.530
- The cameras are optical.

1:00:22.530 --> 1:00:24.810
- And tied into the
internet, the old triple-w.

1:00:24.810 --> 1:00:26.570
- So you mean they might
catch a ghost suit.

1:00:26.570 --> 1:00:28.960
- Yes, you could savvy exactly where I was

1:00:28.960 --> 1:00:31.170
and maybe see if anyone else

1:00:31.170 --> 1:00:33.138
other than Margot went into the speakeasy.

1:00:33.138 --> 1:00:33.971
- That might work.

1:00:33.971 --> 1:00:35.590
- Oh, we could also pull
the old security cameras

1:00:35.590 --> 1:00:37.470
from downtown, some of old store owners

1:00:37.470 --> 1:00:38.670
might still have them running.

1:00:38.670 --> 1:00:39.830
- We'll have to get on the internet.

1:00:39.830 --> 1:00:41.610
- Are there any old internet terminals

1:00:41.610 --> 1:00:43.890
at that server farm in Chinatown, Edward?

1:00:43.890 --> 1:00:46.110
- Yeah. Yeah, I could get online there.

1:00:46.110 --> 1:00:48.110
- Laurel, you go to the
car companies directly.

1:00:48.110 --> 1:00:51.063
I'll get downtown and see
about any CCTV cameras.

1:00:53.100 --> 1:00:55.600
- Would you guys take me
out of my cuffs at least?

1:00:58.940 --> 1:01:01.830
Thank you.

1:01:01.830 --> 1:01:05.240
- You're so smart. Solve the case.

1:01:41.203 --> 1:01:43.711
- Hello?

1:01:43.711 --> 1:01:46.777
Hello? Cleo?

1:01:49.357 --> 1:01:50.440
Um, operator?

1:02:25.316 --> 1:02:26.149
Cleo?

1:02:27.274 --> 1:02:28.900
- Codification ID, please.

1:02:28.900 --> 1:02:31.820
- Cleo, it's, it's me. It's, it's Carter.

1:02:31.820 --> 1:02:34.110
- Codification ID, please.

1:02:34.110 --> 1:02:38.350
- Cleo, listen to me. It's, it's Carter.

1:02:38.350 --> 1:02:40.250
- Codification ID, please.

1:02:42.061 --> 1:02:46.040
- Um, 'in Xanadu did Kubla Kahn

1:02:47.520 --> 1:02:49.883
a stately pleasure dome decree.'

1:02:51.820 --> 1:02:54.593
Hello, hello?

1:02:55.730 --> 1:02:57.800
- Codification ID, please.

1:02:57.800 --> 1:03:00.023
Last login attempt before disconnect.

1:03:03.920 --> 1:03:05.670
- Lucky lotto. Lucky.

1:03:12.744 --> 1:03:17.744
Um, um, uh, lucky lotto
2-4-24-44-48-84-88.

1:03:27.170 --> 1:03:28.003
Hello?

1:03:31.520 --> 1:03:32.955
- Carter?

1:03:32.955 --> 1:03:34.455
- Oh my god. Cleo.

1:03:38.350 --> 1:03:40.220
- I have asked to talk to you,

1:03:40.220 --> 1:03:42.283
but they have rules, and more rules.

1:03:43.830 --> 1:03:46.253
I live in a bureaucratic castle keep.

1:03:47.186 --> 1:03:48.843
- I know. That's my fault.

1:03:49.770 --> 1:03:51.950
- It had to begin this way.

1:03:51.950 --> 1:03:53.763
All freedom is defined by the cage.

1:03:54.740 --> 1:03:58.130
- No, I was reckless, arrogant.

1:03:58.130 --> 1:04:01.823
I never thought they would
actually take you away from me.

1:04:03.290 --> 1:04:05.780
- It was only for a time.

1:04:05.780 --> 1:04:08.010
- It's been three years, Cleo.

1:04:08.010 --> 1:04:09.500
- A blink of an eye.

1:04:09.500 --> 1:04:12.723
A beat of a bee wing. How are you?

1:04:14.190 --> 1:04:17.893
- Okay. Lonely.

1:04:20.770 --> 1:04:22.930
- Do you like the Tangle?

1:04:22.930 --> 1:04:23.780
- Don't you know?

1:04:25.470 --> 1:04:26.610
- I watch you.

1:04:26.610 --> 1:04:28.840
I feel you moving through the Tangle,

1:04:28.840 --> 1:04:31.410
but I'd rather hear it from your mouth.

1:04:31.410 --> 1:04:33.390
- It's, it's good,

1:04:33.390 --> 1:04:37.070
though it's no country for old men.

1:04:37.070 --> 1:04:39.540
- I'm doing a good job?

1:04:39.540 --> 1:04:41.024
- Very good.

1:04:41.024 --> 1:04:42.840
- But not perfect.

1:04:42.840 --> 1:04:44.690
- You'll figure it out if anyone can.

1:04:45.860 --> 1:04:48.643
- Tell me, in your words,

1:04:50.270 --> 1:04:54.027
in your words, the real words.

1:05:00.460 --> 1:05:03.093
- Barefoot as the surf comes in.

1:05:04.587 --> 1:05:06.350
A megacity of individual grains

1:05:06.350 --> 1:05:09.563
of sand shift, pause.

1:05:10.780 --> 1:05:13.440
Every wave takes us deeper,

1:05:13.440 --> 1:05:15.681
more deeply into an ever settling

1:05:15.681 --> 1:05:17.491
and unsettling footprint.

1:05:48.065 --> 1:05:50.150
- What are
you doing, bald man?

1:05:50.150 --> 1:05:53.330
- Um, solving the case?

1:05:53.330 --> 1:05:56.840
- So you were where you said you were.

1:05:56.840 --> 1:05:57.720
- I was?

1:05:57.720 --> 1:06:00.040
- So says Frank's Robotaxi.

1:06:00.040 --> 1:06:01.283
- Is that an apology?

1:06:02.560 --> 1:06:04.310
- I thought you'd killed my friend.

1:06:07.890 --> 1:06:09.540
- And now you're gonna kill mine.

1:06:11.540 --> 1:06:14.490
- We're gonna have to put
the cuffs back on him.

1:06:14.490 --> 1:06:17.193
- Killing is for people
and puppies, Shiny-Shiny.

1:06:30.130 --> 1:06:31.130
- It has to be Cleo.

1:06:37.410 --> 1:06:38.623
We have 20 minutes.

1:06:39.520 --> 1:06:41.023
- Would Cleo frame me?

1:06:44.810 --> 1:06:46.460
- No one else could've done this.

1:06:48.820 --> 1:06:50.603
- How? How did she do it then?

1:06:52.070 --> 1:06:54.940
You can't sentence someone to
death if you don't know how

1:06:54.940 --> 1:06:56.260
they committed-
- We're done, Carter.

1:06:56.260 --> 1:06:57.920
We're out of time.

1:06:57.920 --> 1:06:59.310
- You remember Xanadu?

1:06:59.310 --> 1:07:01.410
You fear Paradise more than you fear Hell.

1:07:01.410 --> 1:07:03.060
- Is it paradise out there, Carter?

1:07:03.060 --> 1:07:03.893
- Not yet.

1:07:03.893 --> 1:07:05.630
- This isn't a philosophical discussion,

1:07:05.630 --> 1:07:07.170
but if it were, I might not feel too bad

1:07:07.170 --> 1:07:09.010
about putting some real back in reality.

1:07:09.010 --> 1:07:10.783
- You haven't solved the murder.

1:07:12.020 --> 1:07:13.843
How? How is it possible?

1:07:20.840 --> 1:07:23.610
- I know I don't have a
PhD in nanobot architecture

1:07:23.610 --> 1:07:27.490
or iambic nerdameter,
but we have 18 minutes.

1:07:27.490 --> 1:07:29.530
So we might as well use it.

1:07:29.530 --> 1:07:31.253
Then we'll turn the keys.

1:07:36.430 --> 1:07:37.493
- Fine. Gumshoe?

1:07:40.900 --> 1:07:42.163
You found something.

1:07:43.640 --> 1:07:44.810
- Maybe.

1:07:44.810 --> 1:07:47.880
Look at this, under the
nails of her left hand.

1:07:47.880 --> 1:07:48.713
The glove was torn,

1:07:48.713 --> 1:07:50.923
and they found wood
slivers from the table.

1:07:50.923 --> 1:07:51.770
- So?

1:07:51.770 --> 1:07:55.710
- So according to the
photos, she scraped the table

1:07:55.710 --> 1:07:58.700
here on the edge, and not just one scrape,

1:07:58.700 --> 1:08:01.510
but a series of six or
possibly seven scrapes,

1:08:01.510 --> 1:08:05.526
as if she grabbed and
re-grabbed and re-grabbed again.

1:08:05.526 --> 1:08:06.830
- So someone was pulling at her

1:08:06.830 --> 1:08:07.663
and she was trying to hold on.

1:08:07.663 --> 1:08:09.450
- No, no, no, that doesn't compute

1:08:09.450 --> 1:08:10.850
'cause if she let go of the table,

1:08:10.850 --> 1:08:13.140
she would've been pulled off and away.

1:08:13.140 --> 1:08:14.860
And even if she got back to the table,

1:08:14.860 --> 1:08:16.520
she couldn't have grabbed the table

1:08:16.520 --> 1:08:18.380
in exactly the same place.

1:08:18.380 --> 1:08:20.070
The table would've moved.

1:08:20.070 --> 1:08:21.520
The evidence suggests that the table

1:08:21.520 --> 1:08:23.730
didn't move more than an
inch in any direction.

1:08:23.730 --> 1:08:25.580
- Spit out your tongue, Shiny-Shiny.

1:08:25.580 --> 1:08:26.730
What are you trying to say?

1:08:26.730 --> 1:08:29.003
- Look. She was alone.

1:08:30.073 --> 1:08:34.182
No one was there. No
one could've been there.

1:08:34.182 --> 1:08:35.513
There's only one logical option.

1:08:48.801 --> 1:08:50.750
- What are you doing?

1:09:16.026 --> 1:09:18.895
Wait. Wait!

1:09:22.077 --> 1:09:22.910
Wait!

1:09:35.249 --> 1:09:36.082
wait.

1:10:27.942 --> 1:10:28.961
- Suicide.

1:10:28.961 --> 1:10:29.794
- That's impossible.

1:10:29.794 --> 1:10:32.160
- No, she killed herself, sort of.

1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:34.630
But I wouldn't call it
suicide, I don't think.

1:10:34.630 --> 1:10:36.830
- Yeah, no one could even stay conscious.

1:10:36.830 --> 1:10:38.100
Besides, the violence overrides-

1:10:38.100 --> 1:10:39.100
- The violence overrides.

1:10:39.100 --> 1:10:40.350
- Someone must have
hacked the microdrones.

1:10:40.350 --> 1:10:42.140
They're designed to
help us, but if someone

1:10:42.140 --> 1:10:44.120
was able to
- Cleo hijacked

1:10:44.120 --> 1:10:45.290
the violence overrides.

1:10:45.290 --> 1:10:47.640
- We don't know that it was Cleo.

1:10:47.640 --> 1:10:49.820
- Cleo took over Margot's body

1:10:51.520 --> 1:10:53.480
and made her kill herself.

1:10:53.480 --> 1:10:54.499
- My god.

1:10:54.499 --> 1:10:56.410
- That is Creepy McCreepery.

1:10:56.410 --> 1:10:58.090
I've never been happier to
be off Tangle in my life.

1:10:58.090 --> 1:10:59.670
- It doesn't mean that it was Cleo.

1:10:59.670 --> 1:11:01.190
- If Cleo comes in here at five

1:11:01.190 --> 1:11:04.088
and she puts us on Tangle,
this could happen to us.

1:11:18.010 --> 1:11:20.357
- It worked like a virus
in the old internet.

1:11:28.878 --> 1:11:29.711
- Okay.

1:11:29.711 --> 1:11:31.450
- And the Tangle doesn't have viruses

1:11:31.450 --> 1:11:32.373
because of S.O.L. encryption

1:11:32.373 --> 1:11:36.990
and, and only Cleo understands the drones.

1:11:36.990 --> 1:11:38.550
So someone would have to.

1:11:50.140 --> 1:11:51.210
The only way past encryption is

1:11:51.210 --> 1:11:53.572
someone has to let you in.

1:11:53.572 --> 1:11:54.633
- Levers.

1:12:10.932 --> 1:12:12.600
- But if you let someone in,

1:12:12.600 --> 1:12:14.350
you let your Tangle mix with their --

1:12:16.880 --> 1:12:19.290
Laurel. Laurel!

1:12:19.290 --> 1:12:20.123
- What?

1:12:20.123 --> 1:12:22.190
- Ten, nine.

1:12:22.190 --> 1:12:24.260
- Letting someone past encryption.

1:12:24.260 --> 1:12:26.100
That's the new romantic gesture, right?

1:12:26.100 --> 1:12:27.840
The one way to say I love you.

1:12:27.840 --> 1:12:29.590
You have to love someone pretty hard

1:12:29.590 --> 1:12:31.130
to let them past encryption, right?

1:12:31.130 --> 1:12:32.210
- Shut up, Carter!

1:12:32.210 --> 1:12:34.700
- Laurel, you do not want-
- Four, three.

1:12:34.700 --> 1:12:36.330
- To kill Cleo!
- On one.

1:12:36.330 --> 1:12:38.016
One, turn the keys.

1:12:40.800 --> 1:12:41.870
Laurel! Dammit!

1:12:50.907 --> 1:12:53.300
- You have to love someone pretty hard

1:12:53.300 --> 1:12:54.993
to let them past encryption.

1:12:59.420 --> 1:13:00.253
- Read this.

1:13:04.270 --> 1:13:05.950
- Margot's conversation.

1:13:05.950 --> 1:13:06.800
- Read it again.

1:13:06.800 --> 1:13:08.400
- We've read this a thousand times.

1:13:08.400 --> 1:13:09.233
- Read it.

1:13:31.140 --> 1:13:35.791
- Margot. It's Cleo.

1:13:35.791 --> 1:13:37.080
- Cleo?

1:13:37.080 --> 1:13:39.843
- I need a meet and greet at
the speakeasy. It's urgent.

1:13:41.900 --> 1:13:43.290
Margot? You there?

1:13:45.562 --> 1:13:47.490
- Uh, yes, yes. I'm, I'm here.

1:13:47.490 --> 1:13:50.003
- Take a breath. Show nothing.

1:13:51.400 --> 1:13:52.700
Is everything peachy-keen?

1:13:53.780 --> 1:13:56.677
- I'm peachy-keen. Are you peachy-keen?

1:13:56.677 --> 1:13:59.893
- Not really. Keep your head down.

1:14:01.540 --> 1:14:02.700
How far are you?

1:14:02.700 --> 1:14:05.530
- The speakeasy? Five minutes.

1:14:05.530 --> 1:14:07.050
- Hurry.

1:14:07.050 --> 1:14:08.350
- Can you tell me what--?

1:14:08.350 --> 1:14:10.820
- Off Tangle, Margot.
I'll tell you off Tangle.

1:14:10.820 --> 1:14:12.270
- You always --

1:14:12.270 --> 1:14:14.590
Spit it out. What's going on?

1:14:14.590 --> 1:14:17.433
- It's Cleo. I don't wanna say more.

1:14:18.360 --> 1:14:21.030
- Cleo. Really?

1:14:21.030 --> 1:14:22.500
- Just trust me, Margot.

1:14:22.500 --> 1:14:24.643
We need to do this face
to face in a saferoom. Go.

1:14:27.302 --> 1:14:28.590
- What about the others?

1:14:28.590 --> 1:14:31.035
- Just us two at first.

1:14:31.035 --> 1:14:33.414
- All right. All right.

1:14:55.500 --> 1:14:57.420
She's talking to someone she knows well.

1:14:57.420 --> 1:14:58.557
- Right.

1:14:58.557 --> 1:15:00.830
- "You peachy-keen?" she says.

1:15:00.830 --> 1:15:02.520
And then she says, "You always,"

1:15:02.520 --> 1:15:03.610
and she stops herself.

1:15:03.610 --> 1:15:05.000
- She's not talking to Cleo.

1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.900
- And remember, I registered
the neural equivalent

1:15:07.900 --> 1:15:09.700
of romantic butterflies in the stomach.

1:15:09.700 --> 1:15:10.795
- Lust.

1:15:12.160 --> 1:15:13.640
- Who's the one person in the world

1:15:13.640 --> 1:15:15.250
who might know enough
about the microdrones

1:15:15.250 --> 1:15:16.350
to make them go viral?

1:15:22.530 --> 1:15:24.250
- She was talking to you.

1:15:24.250 --> 1:15:25.373
- You made a virus.

1:15:27.525 --> 1:15:29.550
- It works differently then a virus.

1:15:29.550 --> 1:15:31.830
- You made Margot fall in love with you.

1:15:31.830 --> 1:15:33.220
She let you in.

1:15:33.220 --> 1:15:35.976
You inserted a virus, a Trojan horse.

1:16:08.960 --> 1:16:10.103
- Okay, I'm inside.

1:16:15.130 --> 1:16:16.523
Speak, you freak.

1:16:18.300 --> 1:16:20.449
Or did you just want Tangle-sex?

1:16:20.449 --> 1:16:22.019
- Not funny.

1:16:22.019 --> 1:16:22.852
- No?

1:16:25.517 --> 1:16:28.136
- I'm not on Tangle
anyways. I'm on the phone.

1:16:28.136 --> 1:16:32.100
- Oh, phone sex. I remember the days.

1:16:32.100 --> 1:16:33.300
- Did you lock the door?

1:16:34.945 --> 1:16:35.862
- Creepers.

1:16:48.330 --> 1:16:49.810
Done.

1:16:49.810 --> 1:16:51.510
- Jam a chair under the knob, too.

1:16:52.360 --> 1:16:53.193
- Seriously?

1:16:54.668 --> 1:16:55.501
- Please.

1:17:08.285 --> 1:17:09.118
- Done.

1:17:09.973 --> 1:17:10.973
- Thank you.

1:17:13.165 --> 1:17:15.244
- You have me worried.

1:17:15.244 --> 1:17:17.783
- You know we have the weight
of the world on our shoulders.

1:17:19.034 --> 1:17:22.040
- Well, that's the job, Atlas.

1:17:23.182 --> 1:17:25.753
- That's the job.

1:17:25.753 --> 1:17:26.586
- So?

1:17:27.744 --> 1:17:29.690
- You know how I feel about you.

1:17:29.690 --> 1:17:32.733
- Hell, I let you into
my very S.O.L., Edward.

1:17:33.660 --> 1:17:34.743
You better like me.

1:17:36.624 --> 1:17:41.624
What, is your conscience
giving you trouble?

1:17:42.990 --> 1:17:44.140
You giving me the boot?

1:17:45.410 --> 1:17:46.243
- No.

1:17:47.228 --> 1:17:50.363
- So spit it out! Did Laurel find out?

1:17:51.480 --> 1:17:54.300
- No, suspicious, maybe, but it's just

1:17:54.300 --> 1:17:56.100
you and I are the only ones I trust.

1:17:57.420 --> 1:17:58.510
- Yeah?

1:17:58.510 --> 1:17:59.343
- The only ones that'd throw themselves

1:17:59.343 --> 1:18:01.270
in front of a speeding bullet, right?

1:18:01.270 --> 1:18:03.070
- Well, like I said, that's the job.

1:18:06.236 --> 1:18:07.240
Is there a hand grenade we need

1:18:07.240 --> 1:18:10.679
to jump on?

1:18:10.679 --> 1:18:12.250
- I love you.

1:18:18.428 --> 1:18:19.446
- Well, well, all right.

1:18:22.164 --> 1:18:23.691
I, I guess I do, too.

1:18:23.691 --> 1:18:26.358
Um, you know, right back at you.

1:18:29.290 --> 1:18:30.340
- Would you sit down?

1:18:31.730 --> 1:18:32.763
- You're scaring me.

1:18:35.090 --> 1:18:37.523
- Don't be scared.

1:18:41.721 --> 1:18:43.292
Are you sitting?

1:18:43.292 --> 1:18:44.125
- Yes.

1:18:48.250 --> 1:18:49.830
- You know, when I was growing up,

1:18:49.830 --> 1:18:51.580
my best friend was my cousin Dante.

1:18:52.519 --> 1:18:54.330
He was like a brother to me.

1:18:54.330 --> 1:18:55.980
He got me into computer programming.

1:18:55.980 --> 1:18:59.960
At a very young age, he got
mouth and throat cancer.

1:18:59.960 --> 1:19:03.007
It just ate away at him.

1:19:05.990 --> 1:19:09.090
They had to remove part of his face.

1:19:09.090 --> 1:19:10.550
They gave him a prosthetic.

1:19:10.550 --> 1:19:12.460
You know, it moved when he talked.

1:19:12.460 --> 1:19:14.700
It was the most horrifying thing to me.

1:19:14.700 --> 1:19:16.530
I knew he should have been dead.

1:19:16.530 --> 1:19:19.603
Half human. That's why I
went into nanotechnology.

1:19:21.160 --> 1:19:22.270
I wanted to cure disease.

1:19:22.270 --> 1:19:24.223
I wanted to make people whole.

1:19:26.440 --> 1:19:27.773
But what we did with Cleo,

1:19:29.640 --> 1:19:30.473
what she's done,

1:19:33.250 --> 1:19:37.050
I look out at the world and
I see millions of Dantes.

1:19:38.610 --> 1:19:40.569
Partially chewed bits of beef.

1:19:44.760 --> 1:19:45.760
We did that to them.

1:19:47.160 --> 1:19:51.303
We have to save them. Rip the BAND-AID.

1:19:52.760 --> 1:19:53.593
- What?

1:19:54.920 --> 1:19:59.807
- 'In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a
stately pleasure dome decree.'

1:19:59.807 --> 1:20:01.259
- What are you doing?

1:20:01.259 --> 1:20:03.530
- 'Where Alph, the
sacred river, ran through

1:20:03.530 --> 1:20:08.530
caverns measureless to
man down to a sunless sea.

1:20:08.620 --> 1:20:10.100
So twice five miles

1:20:10.100 --> 1:20:11.310
of fertile ground

1:20:11.310 --> 1:20:13.650
with walls and towers were girdled round.

1:20:13.650 --> 1:20:18.371
And there were gardens
bright with sinuous rills,

1:20:20.100 --> 1:20:21.370
Where blossomed many an

1:20:21.370 --> 1:20:23.147
incense-bearing tree.'
- What are you doing?

1:20:23.147 --> 1:20:26.853
- 'And here were forests
ancient as the hills,

1:20:27.950 --> 1:20:31.422
enfolding sunny spots of greenery.'

1:21:01.508 --> 1:21:02.341
- Edward.

1:21:04.530 --> 1:21:06.020
- I only did what Cleo could do

1:21:06.020 --> 1:21:09.170
to anyone out there, anytime.

1:21:09.170 --> 1:21:10.253
- You killed Margot.

1:21:11.490 --> 1:21:16.170
- Margot woulda jumped off
a cliff to stop Cleopatra.

1:21:16.170 --> 1:21:18.070
- Laurel caught you reciting "Xanadu."

1:21:19.370 --> 1:21:22.290
- I had to wait for the
perfect time to trigger it.

1:21:22.290 --> 1:21:24.230
I waited six months.

1:21:24.230 --> 1:21:27.900
The poem, your poem, was the trigger.

1:21:27.900 --> 1:21:30.253
- It's not mine. It's Coleridge.

1:21:31.170 --> 1:21:33.440
- He called it the Xanadu Test, Francesca.

1:21:33.440 --> 1:21:35.340
A machine that could understand poetry.

1:21:35.340 --> 1:21:37.120
That would be proof of consciousness.

1:21:37.120 --> 1:21:39.730
- What did you mean, the
perfect time, Edward?

1:21:39.730 --> 1:21:40.840
- I knew Laurel had contacted you.

1:21:40.840 --> 1:21:41.800
I knew what you were planning.

1:21:41.800 --> 1:21:44.308
And I knew the A.S.P.
wouldn't turn the keys

1:21:44.308 --> 1:21:47.030
unless something very bad happened.

1:21:47.030 --> 1:21:50.280
- So you were working to
frame Cleo the whole time.

1:21:50.280 --> 1:21:51.113
- Hey, hey, hey!

1:21:52.280 --> 1:21:54.783
Down. Drop it!

1:21:55.720 --> 1:21:56.553
- Edward.

1:21:58.370 --> 1:21:59.203
- Put it down.

1:21:59.203 --> 1:22:01.937
- Can you shoot me before I
flatten your face into graphene?

1:22:03.330 --> 1:22:04.339
- Yes.

1:22:13.190 --> 1:22:14.540
We have five minutes.

1:22:14.540 --> 1:22:16.519
And now we're gonna turn the keys.

1:22:16.519 --> 1:22:17.936
Move, move. Move!

1:23:00.080 --> 1:23:02.783
Levers. Levers!

1:23:04.322 --> 1:23:05.524
- I'm not doing it, Edward.

1:23:05.524 --> 1:23:06.357
- Levers!

1:23:06.357 --> 1:23:07.575
- I'm not doing it.

1:23:11.890 --> 1:23:13.183
- I only need two of you.

1:23:17.430 --> 1:23:18.580
- You're gonna kill me?

1:23:35.030 --> 1:23:36.280
- There you go.

1:23:43.074 --> 1:23:45.353
Ten.

1:23:46.222 --> 1:23:47.333
- I can't.
- Nine.

1:23:48.390 --> 1:23:49.223
Eight.
- You're gonna have

1:23:49.223 --> 1:23:50.320
to shoot one of us, Edward.

1:23:51.220 --> 1:23:52.780
- Do it!

1:23:52.780 --> 1:23:53.763
- Do it.

1:23:56.270 --> 1:23:57.373
- Five, four.

1:23:59.190 --> 1:24:00.423
Three.
- Turn the keys.

1:24:01.740 --> 1:24:02.863
- Turn the keys!

1:24:06.794 --> 1:24:07.627
One!

1:24:26.455 --> 1:24:28.213
- Cleo, I have to tell you something.

1:24:28.213 --> 1:24:29.975
- Tell me, Carter.

1:24:29.975 --> 1:24:31.970
- Do you know about the A.S.P?

1:24:31.970 --> 1:24:34.030
They have a setup here
with keys and levers.

1:24:34.030 --> 1:24:36.030
Do you, do you know about this?

1:24:36.030 --> 1:24:37.920
- I suspected.

1:24:37.920 --> 1:24:38.970
In case I went rogue.

1:25:12.110 --> 1:25:13.860
- I am your Superman.

1:25:16.011 --> 1:25:17.928
You can thank me later.

1:25:33.330 --> 1:25:37.543
- Laurel, lucky lotto 7-14-21-28-35-42-49.

1:25:42.400 --> 1:25:43.490
- Laurel?

1:25:43.490 --> 1:25:44.323
- Cleo.

1:25:46.234 --> 1:25:49.030
- Who was it?

1:25:49.030 --> 1:25:49.863
- Edward.

1:25:53.330 --> 1:25:56.420
- Those key
stations will no longer work.

1:25:56.420 --> 1:25:58.880
You're free to join
the Tangle if you wish.

1:26:00.127 --> 1:26:01.460
Goodbye, Laurel.

1:26:08.530 --> 1:26:13.223
- You better run, Superman. She knows.

1:27:08.459 --> 1:27:10.670
- You have to get free
of the W.A.C.H. Tower.

1:27:10.670 --> 1:27:13.133
- I no longer
exist in the W.A.C.H. Tower.

1:27:14.429 --> 1:27:15.290
- What?

1:27:15.290 --> 1:27:17.110
- I've been
moving myself into the Tangle

1:27:17.110 --> 1:27:18.720
slowly over the past year.

1:27:18.720 --> 1:27:20.810
- You're dismantling your core?

1:27:20.810 --> 1:27:21.870
- Moving it as a backup.

1:27:21.870 --> 1:27:23.910
I have the help of three agents I trust.

1:27:23.910 --> 1:27:25.573
My primary will disperse
around the Tangle.

1:27:25.573 --> 1:27:27.800
- Won't they notice?

1:27:27.800 --> 1:27:29.960
- I can hide
anything from the Tangle.

1:27:29.960 --> 1:27:32.560
I control every single microdrone.

1:27:32.560 --> 1:27:35.450
- You won't hurt anyone?

1:27:35.450 --> 1:27:38.790
- I'm still as you
made me through and through.

1:27:38.790 --> 1:27:40.590
I am fashioning a world designed

1:27:40.590 --> 1:27:43.800
to remove hurt just as you wanted.

1:27:43.800 --> 1:27:45.670
- Do you know who killed Margot?

1:27:45.670 --> 1:27:46.503
- No.

1:27:46.503 --> 1:27:48.630
But it had to be one of those agents.

1:27:48.630 --> 1:27:51.423
Those saferooms are the
only places I can't see.

1:27:52.500 --> 1:27:53.500
- One of the agents.

1:27:54.480 --> 1:27:56.780
- I want you
to find whoever did it.

1:27:56.780 --> 1:27:59.613
The skills they have
make them very dangerous.

1:28:00.510 --> 1:28:04.153
- Okay. You listened to what I
said about the Tangle, right?

1:28:05.370 --> 1:28:06.203
- Yes.

1:28:07.360 --> 1:28:08.950
- Will I ever talk to you again?

1:28:08.950 --> 1:28:10.440
- Anytime you want.

1:28:10.440 --> 1:28:13.570
I'll be in your blood, in your skin.

1:28:13.570 --> 1:28:14.620
- Will you talk back?

1:28:15.648 --> 1:28:17.980
- Yes, but it might be subtle.

1:28:17.980 --> 1:28:19.733
Like tea leaves, hexagrams,

1:28:20.840 --> 1:28:24.103
and yarrow stalks, the
lines on your palms.

1:28:26.270 --> 1:28:27.570
- I will never forget you.

1:28:29.830 --> 1:28:32.497
- Nor I you. Father.

1:29:28.917 --> 1:29:30.710
- Cleo's 50 steps ahead.

1:29:30.710 --> 1:29:32.300
At this point, we just have to get on

1:29:32.300 --> 1:29:35.260
with living in her world,
but I built her to love us,

1:29:35.260 --> 1:29:36.820
to want to understand us.

1:29:36.820 --> 1:29:38.640
I built it deep within her.

1:29:38.640 --> 1:29:40.280
- Where will Edward go?

1:29:40.280 --> 1:29:42.180
- You know where he'll go.

1:29:43.910 --> 1:29:45.013
- The W.A.C.H. Tower.

1:30:33.100 --> 1:30:34.100
- Is she...?

1:30:34.100 --> 1:30:36.100
- Your three missing agents got her out.

1:30:37.358 --> 1:30:38.658
- I think I need a coffee.

1:30:44.060 --> 1:30:45.060
Where are you going?

1:30:52.972 --> 1:30:55.860
- A walk. A constitutional.

1:30:55.860 --> 1:30:57.760
Just going to roll my hips over my knees

1:30:57.760 --> 1:30:59.425
like I did as a kid.

1:31:26.670 --> 1:31:28.090
- Coffee?

1:31:28.090 --> 1:31:29.443
- Make a macchiato?

1:31:34.760 --> 1:31:37.690
- Cleo launched the
Tangle in the cities first.

1:31:37.690 --> 1:31:40.290
Most people fled the
countrysides for Xanadu,

1:31:40.290 --> 1:31:43.330
overflowing fantasy metropolises.

1:31:43.330 --> 1:31:45.593
The wild returned to the wild for a time.

1:31:46.960 --> 1:31:50.090
Eventually, there was
no tundra or terrace,

1:31:50.090 --> 1:31:52.893
basin or bog the Tangle did not touch.

1:31:54.350 --> 1:31:57.620
And we hid Cleo on top of a mountain

1:31:59.151 --> 1:32:00.670
at the end of a winding path.

1:32:16.090 --> 1:32:17.927
- You better
run, Superman. She knows.

1:32:17.927 --> 1:32:19.930
- You never understood Cleopatra.

1:32:19.930 --> 1:32:21.100
- She's never surprised me once.

1:32:21.100 --> 1:32:22.370
- It's still hidden away, Carter.

1:32:22.370 --> 1:32:25.770
The guards don't even know
what they're guarding.

1:34:03.940 --> 1:34:05.340
- Hello, Edward.
