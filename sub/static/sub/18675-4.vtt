I don't like being lied to,
especially by my friends.

You're
in the wrong business.

Listen, if I knew
for a fact Iran was close

40:33.917 --> 40:37.750
to a nuclear weapon,
I'd tell you.

40:37.750 --> 40:40.417
Define "close."
Is ten years too close?

40:40.417 --> 40:44.750
Because best case scenario,
Iran has a bomb in ten years.

You don't.

40:50.708 --> 40:53.125
And the question I keep
asking myself is this --

40:53.125 --> 40:55.708
should we pack up and leave
before it's too late?

40:55.708 --> 40:57.500
All eight million of us?

40:57.500 --> 41:00.834
Should we go back to
the ghettos of Europe and Asia

41:00.834 --> 41:03.291
and wait for the next pogrom?

41:04.542 --> 41:07.125
Or just pray it doesn't
happen here first,
