00:03.253 --> 00:05.672
- "L"
- Laryngitis.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.799
- "M"
- Mumps.

00:07.966 --> 00:09.760
- "N"
- Narcolepsy. "O"

00:10.010 --> 00:13.639
Do we have to do this every time we
decide who has to clean the refrigerator?

00:13.722 --> 00:17.351
- You wanna go back to thumb wrestling?
- Osteoporosis. "P"

00:17.434 --> 00:19.978
- Puppies!
- That's not a disease.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.189
Oh, boy!

00:25.317 --> 00:26.693
Hi!

00:34.743 --> 00:36.995
- Rory, look at the baby.
- Mom.

00:38.121 --> 00:41.667
'Buttercup was found cold and wet,
hovering under a hydrangea bush...

00:41.708 --> 00:44.670
'along Highway 26.' It's a sad highway!

00:44.711 --> 00:48.006
As compared to all the happy highways
she could've been abandoned by?

00:48.048 --> 00:52.344
'Her lineage includes cocker spaniel,
golden retriever, Bouvier des Flandres... '

00:52.386 --> 00:55.180
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you. 'And rottweiler. '

00:55.222 --> 00:58.141
'Buttercup is a special dog.
She is extremely skittish...

00:58.225 --> 01:01.645
'and tends to react badly toward
blond-haired females, brunette males...

01:01.728 --> 01:06.066
'children of either sex, other animals, red
clothing, cabbage, or anyone in uniform. '

01:06.149 --> 01:08.944
- We just found the doggy version of you.
- Can I help you?

01:09.027 --> 01:12.656
Do not let these two anywhere near a dog.
They can barely feed themselves.

01:12.739 --> 01:15.200
Shut up. We would be
excellent pet owners, thank you.

01:15.283 --> 01:17.869
- You cannot be serious.
- We could get him a pretty bowl.

01:17.953 --> 01:19.746
- It's a her.
- And a new name.

01:19.830 --> 01:22.290
- Mom.
- This Buttercup thing really has to go.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.543
- Do I need to remind you of Skippy?
- Skippy?

01:24.626 --> 01:27.713
- I can't believe you would bring that up.
- Skippy was our hamster.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.548
- He doesn't care.
- What happened to him?

01:29.589 --> 01:30.590
Nothing.

01:30.674 --> 01:33.385
Every time Mom put her hand in his cage,
he'd bite her.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.554
- And laugh.
- Hamsters can't laugh.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.723
This one laughed. Trust me.

01:38.056 --> 01:41.143
- So, finally, she got fed up.
- Of being laughed at by a hamster?

01:41.226 --> 01:42.185
Yeah.

01:42.269 --> 01:46.189
She stopped cleaning its cage. Instead,
every day she'd stuff Kleenex in there.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.275
- You didn't.
- It was the quilted kind.

01:48.358 --> 01:52.070
This goes on, and the cage is just
a cage full of Kleenex that moves a little.

01:52.154 --> 01:54.114
- And the smell, really good.
- I can imagine.

01:54.156 --> 01:55.240
No, you can't.

01:55.323 --> 01:58.076
Then she takes the cage
to the place where we bought him...

01:58.160 --> 02:02.247
waits for the sales guy to go behind the
desk, dumps it on the counter, then bolts.

02:02.330 --> 02:03.582
You abandoned your hamster?

02:03.665 --> 02:05.876
I know it was bad,
but this was a vicious hamster.

02:05.959 --> 02:10.881
This was like a Damien hamster with
little beady eyes, and a big forked tail...

02:10.964 --> 02:14.384
and a cape with a hood and...

02:14.718 --> 02:18.138
- Bye, Buttercup. Bye, Luke.
- You did the right thing.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.807
- I want a pet.
- You have me.

02:20.891 --> 02:24.311
- You won't get my slippers in the morning.
- I might if you had slippers.

02:24.394 --> 02:25.604
- Will you wear a collar?
- No.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.230
- It'll be pink.
- You're sick.

02:27.314 --> 02:30.984
Watch how you talk to me.
Remember what happened to Skippy.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.074

03:35.799 --> 03:37.467
God, this is good.

03:38.385 --> 03:41.388
- Okay, correct me if I'm wrong.
- Salt, please.

03:41.513 --> 03:44.766
Twenty minutes ago, we were
sitting at the dinner table, weren't we?

03:44.849 --> 03:45.850
Yes, we were.

03:45.934 --> 03:50.188
There were candles and flowers
and plates and knives and cloth napkins.

03:50.272 --> 03:52.983
I loved the little sombrero napkin holders.
Very ole.

03:53.024 --> 03:55.360
And the whole time
we were at said dinner table...

03:55.402 --> 03:58.655
you ate two, maybe three bites
of this amazing dinner I made for you.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.323
Pass the bread.

04:01.116 --> 04:04.411
Yet, as soon as that dinner is over
and I start cleaning up...

04:04.494 --> 04:06.496
suddenly, that's when you're starving.

04:06.538 --> 04:09.541
What can I say? Watching someone work
makes me hungry.

04:09.582 --> 04:12.752
If I hadn't stopped watching
This Old House, I'd be 500 pounds now.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.504
What are you doing?

04:14.587 --> 04:17.548
- Passing these to you.
- In the dish, please.

04:21.011 --> 04:24.014
Where did you learn to make
osso buco, anyway?

04:24.806 --> 04:29.769
From this very old Italian woman
who used to live upstairs.

04:31.021 --> 04:35.400
She had lost her husband a couple of years
before, and she looked at me like a son.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.444
- Sweet.
- She was.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.863
- So an old girlfriend?
- Yeah.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.324
- So, would you like some coffee?
- Yes, please.

04:50.206 --> 04:53.293
- Did you read Rory's paper yet?
- Not yet.

04:53.752 --> 04:55.837
- It's really good.
- I'm sure it is.

04:55.920 --> 05:00.050
- Look, it's right on top.
- Isn't that a coincidence?

05:02.594 --> 05:05.346
There are some really big words in here.

05:05.597 --> 05:08.057
I hope you have a dictionary with you
when you read it.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.267
I will.

05:09.350 --> 05:13.730
I could just save you the time,
and put an 'A' on it for you.

05:15.440 --> 05:19.527
That wouldn't be fair to the other students
whose mothers aren't here, would it?

05:19.611 --> 05:21.237
Yes, you're right.

05:21.488 --> 05:25.992
Although, life isn't fair, and the sooner
those kids learn that, the better.

05:26.075 --> 05:28.203
I'll take that advice into account.

05:30.371 --> 05:32.123
These are beautiful.

05:34.459 --> 05:37.045
I never read Proust. I always wanted to.

05:37.128 --> 05:38.588
Every now and then...

05:38.671 --> 05:42.258
I'm seized with an overwhelming urge
to say something like:

05:42.300 --> 05:46.554
'As Marcel Proust would say... '
But I have no idea what he would say.

05:46.638 --> 05:50.892
So I don't even go there. I could do,
'As Michael Crichton would say... '

05:50.975 --> 05:53.937
- but it's not exactly the same.
- Take it.

05:54.938 --> 05:59.067
- Oh, no! It looks so valuable.
- It's a book. It's meant to be read.

05:59.651 --> 06:02.153
- You sure?
- Take it. Read it.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.113
Okay, I will.

06:09.661 --> 06:11.204
- Not now.
- What?

06:12.622 --> 06:15.375
I'd rather you didn't read it right now.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.585
But what about...

06:20.213 --> 06:22.006
my required reading?

06:24.384 --> 06:27.136
But I won't make the cheerleading squad.

06:28.638 --> 06:33.226
Mr. Medina, is this my extra-credit work,
because Missy just had to take a test.

06:41.859 --> 06:44.195
Where do you think you're going?

06:45.113 --> 06:46.114
Hi.

06:46.906 --> 06:48.491
It's 1:00 in the morning.

06:49.158 --> 06:53.204
I know, but my watch stopped
during a terrible car wreck...

06:53.705 --> 06:57.834
and I had to save kittens
and small children and four baby chicks.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.878
- Did you have a nice time?
- Not bad.

07:01.212 --> 07:04.048
That's a very big smile for a not bad night.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.968
- Yeah, well. He loaned me a book.
- What book?

07:07.051 --> 07:09.304
- Swann's Way.
- Aren't we ambitious?

07:09.387 --> 07:10.388
Yes, we are.

07:10.471 --> 07:12.765
You know what it means
when a man loans you a book?

07:12.849 --> 07:15.184
- That he's already read it?
- Yeah.

07:15.393 --> 07:17.103
- How was your night?
- Homework.

07:17.186 --> 07:19.439
- How many times did Dean call?
- Not that many.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.149
- How many?
- Three.

07:21.899 --> 07:25.820
- Five.
- Not an all-time high, but very respectable.

07:26.696 --> 07:29.907
- I'm going to bed. Are you staying here?
- Yeah, I'm comfortable.

07:29.991 --> 07:33.202
I've got the pillows
in a perfect mushed position.

07:36.497 --> 07:37.915
Night, Mom.

07:37.957 --> 07:41.419
- You just go think about what you've done.
- I will.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.759
- What?
- You look happy.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.636
- I am, kid.
- Just checking.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.852
'There's a certain slant of light

07:58.394 --> 08:00.188
'Winter afternoons

08:00.480 --> 08:02.732
'That oppresses, like the heft

08:03.274 --> 08:05.068
'Of cathedral tunes'

08:05.651 --> 08:10.239
That, my friends, is the first verse
of a poem by Emily Dickinson.

08:10.448 --> 08:14.077
Read some of those tonight,
and as you do, consider the fact...

08:14.118 --> 08:18.414
that Emily Dickinson writes convincingly
about passion and about the world...

08:18.456 --> 08:22.043
in spite of the fact
that she lived as a virtual recluse.

08:22.293 --> 08:24.837
It'll help you appreciate her mind.

08:28.674 --> 08:31.803
I could listen to him
talk about passion all day.

08:31.886 --> 08:34.597
- Do you think he's dating anyone?
- Of course he is.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.515
- A teacher?
- Please.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.809
- Why not?
- Have you seen teachers?

08:38.893 --> 08:41.895
- He's a teacher.
- Male teachers are different.

08:42.020 --> 08:45.525
- They can still be mysterious.
- I bet his girlfriend's pretty.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.485
- I bet she's dumb.
- Why?

08:47.652 --> 08:49.654
Dumb girls crave smart men.

08:49.737 --> 08:52.657
It's the whole
Marilyn Monroe-Arthur Miller syndrome.

08:52.698 --> 08:53.991
I still think she's lucky.

08:54.075 --> 08:57.119
Whoever he's dating is a loser
who doesn't care he's a teacher...

08:57.203 --> 09:00.456
in this ridiculous school
making a ridiculous teacher's salary.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.500
What are you looking at?

09:02.750 --> 09:04.669
Guess someone read the paper today.

09:04.752 --> 09:08.172
I know. Paris'parents' divorce
is getting very ugly.

09:08.214 --> 09:11.509
Her dad should've paid her mom more
and this thing would've been over.

09:11.592 --> 09:12.677
That's what my dad did.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.011
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:15.012 --> 09:19.350
Is it true Paris' mom had the entire
back of her body surgically reconstructed?

09:19.433 --> 09:22.144
It doesn't match the front now, does it?

09:23.854 --> 09:26.399
- How's the squab?
- It's good.

09:28.192 --> 09:30.319
It's the best tiny, weird bird
I've ever eaten.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.404
I'm glad.

09:31.487 --> 09:33.739
- Why are you smiling like that?
- What?

09:33.823 --> 09:35.575
- You're smiling.
- I'm happy.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.661
- That's not your'I'm happy' smile.
- What smile is it, Lorelai?

09:38.744 --> 09:41.038
That's your
'I've got something on Lorelai' smile.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.833
- Rory, your mother must be very tired.
- She works a lot.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.168
I grew up with that smile.
I know that smile.

09:46.210 --> 09:49.755
- Tell me about school.
- My French final went pretty well.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.508
You can change the subject.
I know the smile.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.469
- Whatever you say, dear.
- I've used it a few times myself.

09:55.553 --> 09:56.512
Mom.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.181
- Tell me about Parents' Day.
- What?

10:00.224 --> 10:01.934
Parents' Day. Next Wednesday.

10:02.018 --> 10:05.021
When parents are supposed to
go to classes with their children.

10:05.062 --> 10:07.189
The Chilton newsletter came out today.

10:07.231 --> 10:08.399
- Yeah.
- Right.

10:08.482 --> 10:10.318
- You didn't read yours?
- Not yet.

10:11.068 --> 10:13.195
But you knew that. Hence the smile.

10:13.279 --> 10:17.408
You're really being silly.
There is no evil plan afoot here.

10:17.491 --> 10:20.286
I simply brought up a subject
I thought we could talk about.

10:20.369 --> 10:22.747
- Right.
- I'll try another subject.

10:23.914 --> 10:26.208
The color blue is very pleasant, isn't it?

10:26.250 --> 10:30.087
Not everybody can wait outside
the mailbox for the Chilton newsletter...

10:30.129 --> 10:32.548
and instantly memorize the contents
in three seconds.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.592
I'd like to weigh in on the color subject.

10:34.675 --> 10:37.511
You have your priorities.
Far be it for me to question them.

10:37.595 --> 10:40.890
Just because I didn't read it
doesn't mean I don't care about Rory.

10:40.931 --> 10:42.475
- So are you going?
- To what?

10:42.558 --> 10:43.559
To Parents' Day.

10:43.601 --> 10:46.520
Can we talk about it next Friday
when I've read the newsletter?

10:46.604 --> 10:47.605
It'll be more fun.

10:47.688 --> 10:50.608
We could, except that Parents' Day
is next Wednesday.

10:50.649 --> 10:51.942
- Wednesday?
- Yeah.

10:52.026 --> 10:54.570
If you talked about it on Friday,
you would've missed it.

10:54.653 --> 10:57.406
- Wednesday?
- It's okay, you don't have to be there.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.159
- We could talk about how you missed it.
- I won't miss it.

11:00.242 --> 11:02.411
Mom, it's not a big deal. You're busy.

11:02.453 --> 11:04.997
- You know what? I'll go.
- What?

11:05.081 --> 11:09.210
Why not? You have to work.
I, as you have insinuated, have no life.

11:09.293 --> 11:11.754
Therefore, I will go sit with Rory
at Parents' Day.

11:11.796 --> 11:16.217
I'm not busy. I'm going. I will be there.
That's it. End of story, okay?

11:16.634 --> 11:18.052
- Fine.
- Fine.

11:19.178 --> 11:23.099
Did you read on Page 2
about the mother-daughter talent show?

11:25.851 --> 11:27.144
You okay?

11:28.854 --> 11:31.107
Mom, I have to go. It's almost 8:00.

11:31.148 --> 11:34.735
Wait. Have you seen
my orange suede hairclip thingy?

11:34.819 --> 11:37.488
- Top right-hand drawer.
- It's not there.

11:38.614 --> 11:40.449
- Did you check in your purse?
- Yes.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.409
- Under your scarves?
- Yes.

11:42.493 --> 11:44.245
In your sock drawer?

11:47.289 --> 11:48.457
I love you.

11:48.499 --> 11:50.084
- I'm gone.
- Bye.

11:51.627 --> 11:53.420
- Wait!
- What?

11:53.754 --> 11:55.881
- Blue disco sequin bag.
- No.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.049
- Why?
- Bad.

11:57.132 --> 11:58.592
- Really?
- Bye.

11:59.718 --> 12:03.347
- Wait!
- Mr. Medina's gonna be here any minute!

12:03.430 --> 12:06.600
Just tell me one more thing.
Where's the silver dangly bracelet?

12:06.684 --> 12:08.435
- I'm wearing it.
- Why are you wearing it?

12:08.519 --> 12:11.146
- Because it's mine.
- Right.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.691
Can I borrow your silver dangly bracelet?

12:13.774 --> 12:15.734
- I'll leave it on the table.
- Thank you.

12:19.154 --> 12:21.490
- What was that?
- The doorbell rang.

12:22.324 --> 12:25.244
- Why did the doorbell ring?
- Because someone's at the door.

12:25.327 --> 12:28.289
It's 8:00.
Who shows up at 8:00 for an 8:00 date?

12:28.372 --> 12:29.999
I don't know. Maybe a Chilton teacher?

12:30.082 --> 12:32.543
Everyone knows that 8:00
means 8:15 tops!

12:32.626 --> 12:34.336
Obviously, he was raised in a barn.

12:34.378 --> 12:38.048
He's cute, but his punctuality knocks
10 points off the dream guy quotient.

12:38.132 --> 12:40.050
What do I do? I'm not supposed to be here.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.552
Okay, so go.

12:41.885 --> 12:43.887
Wait, you have to get the door.

12:43.971 --> 12:45.514
- What?
- Because I'm not ready.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.516
I'm not supposed to get the door.
We agreed.

12:47.558 --> 12:50.060
- I don't get the door when you have a date.
- I know...

12:50.144 --> 12:53.230
I shouldn't be here.
First rule of the Gilmore Dating Handbook.

12:53.314 --> 12:56.442
'Daughter shall be nowhere near house
when said man materializes. '

12:56.525 --> 12:58.027
It's a good rule. It's been working.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.070
He's standing there, it's cold...

13:00.112 --> 13:03.365
and my slip is now completely stuck
in my skirt zipper.

13:03.741 --> 13:05.284
Just this once.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.959
- Hi.
- Rory.

13:14.418 --> 13:16.378
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

13:21.091 --> 13:23.719
Can I get you something?
We don't really have anything...

13:23.761 --> 13:26.805
but if you wanted something
and we had it, I'd get it for you.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.098
I'm fine.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.392
- We have water.
- That's okay.

13:30.601 --> 13:33.896
It's not bad water, actually.
It's not a funny color or anything.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.606
I'm good, really.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.485
- We have bottled water.
- No, thanks.

13:39.568 --> 13:42.488
- One bottle, actually.
- It's quite all right.

13:42.946 --> 13:45.366
We really need to go to the store.

13:48.619 --> 13:52.247
- Should we...
- Sit? Right. Yeah, let's sit.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.752
So, what are your plans tonight?

13:56.835 --> 14:00.047
- I'm going over to my friend Lane's house.
- Sounds good.

14:00.130 --> 14:03.300
- And you guys are...
- Dinner, movies, the usual.

14:03.884 --> 14:05.094
Right.

14:13.852 --> 14:16.063
- This is a little uncomfortable.
- Yes, it is.

14:16.146 --> 14:20.150
But the thing is, if things go well,
the way I hope they're going...

14:20.234 --> 14:21.860
we might be doing this again.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.821
Sitting uncomfortably?

14:24.279 --> 14:26.824
Seeing each other outside of school.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.200
That's okay.

14:28.283 --> 14:30.911
I am fine with
this whole you and my mom thing.

14:30.994 --> 14:32.955
Good. I'm glad.

14:34.790 --> 14:35.874
I better go.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.961
- It was good to talk to you.
- You, too, Mr. Medina.

14:39.044 --> 14:42.506
Why don't you call me Max?
Just when we're out of school.

14:42.548 --> 14:45.175
- I don't think I can do that.
- Why not?

14:45.342 --> 14:48.011
It just sounds wrong. Disrespectful.

14:48.470 --> 14:52.891
I mean, you're my teacher, Mr. Medina,
and if I start thinking of you as a Max...

14:52.975 --> 14:56.228
even as a part-time Max,
it just seems like it'll get too confusing.

14:56.311 --> 15:00.649
How about this, then? We'll come up with
non-Chilton names for each other.

15:00.691 --> 15:03.694
When we're not in school,
I'll call you Rebecca.

15:03.735 --> 15:05.946
- Rebecca.
- And you'll call me?

15:06.321 --> 15:07.906
- Norman?
- Norman?

15:08.532 --> 15:11.285
- I look like a Norman to you?
- I'm sorry.

15:11.368 --> 15:14.746
Psycho was on earlier, and it was just
the first name that came to mind.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.582
I'll think of something else.

15:16.665 --> 15:19.543
- How about Alfred?
- You know what? Norman's fine.

15:19.626 --> 15:20.669
Are you sure?

15:20.711 --> 15:23.672
Positive. I love it.
I might make a legal change.

15:23.714 --> 15:25.632
Okay. I better go.

15:25.716 --> 15:28.802
- I hope you and Lane have a good time.
- Thanks.

15:30.345 --> 15:33.557
- Would you give this to my mom for me?
- Absolutely.

15:33.640 --> 15:34.850
Thanks.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.604
Norman? Have her home by 10:00.

15:44.484 --> 15:46.570
I can't believe
you won't just sell them to me.

15:46.653 --> 15:48.906
And I can't believe
you're being so small-minded.

15:48.989 --> 15:52.409
My stuffed fried squash blossoms
are extremely popular with customers.

15:52.492 --> 15:53.493
Yes, I know.

15:53.577 --> 15:56.330
People come from all over
and demand them.

15:56.413 --> 15:58.749
- That is exactly my point.
- 'What'll you have, sir?'

15:58.832 --> 16:01.543
'Anything that comes with
stuffed fried squash blossoms. '

16:01.627 --> 16:04.087
That's what I hear day in day out.

16:04.171 --> 16:05.714
Yes, great. I know.

16:05.756 --> 16:09.259
But all I'm asking you is to try
stuffing something different this time.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.720
- A zucchini tush?
- Just a temporary name.

16:11.762 --> 16:15.974
You want me to serve a genetically
engineered vegetable named after a butt?

16:16.058 --> 16:18.727
This is an all-natural vegetable hybrid...

16:18.769 --> 16:21.271
that is perfectly safe,
completely delicious, and...

16:21.355 --> 16:24.441
Yes, it looks a little odd,
but you can put it on the map!

16:24.524 --> 16:26.276
- I want the blossoms.
- Fine.

16:26.360 --> 16:29.279
You wanna think small, think small.
I'm done.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.578
- Jackson invented a new vegetable again?
- Yeah.

16:36.620 --> 16:39.039
It's too bad Bowling League
didn't work out for him.

16:39.122 --> 16:40.207
Yeah.

16:41.541 --> 16:43.335
- Look, I found them.
- Where?

16:43.418 --> 16:45.420
They were in the drawer
with the roasting pans.

16:45.504 --> 16:46.588
- Cool.
- Skates.

16:46.630 --> 16:48.173
Rory and I have a skating date.

16:48.256 --> 16:50.425
- I'm Nancy Kerrigan.
- And I'm Tonya Harding.

16:50.467 --> 16:52.386
I'll do the whole shoelace-coming-untied...

16:52.469 --> 16:55.514
nervous-breakdown-let-me-start-again act
and everything.

16:55.597 --> 16:58.642
When was the last time
you put those things on?

16:58.725 --> 17:02.270
- You are constantly trying to ruin my fun.
- Do they even fit anymore?

17:02.354 --> 17:04.106
- Yes, they fit.
- They look rusted.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.733
Can I just have some coffee, please?

17:07.358 --> 17:08.984
- Hand them over.
- Why?

17:09.069 --> 17:11.279
I'm gonna clean them
and tighten the blades.

17:11.320 --> 17:12.489
- Really?
- Yes.

17:12.571 --> 17:14.991
- Can you make them really shiny?
- The skates, please.

17:15.032 --> 17:16.992
- Maybe add a few pompoms?
- Hand them over.

17:17.035 --> 17:18.286
Thank you.

17:18.744 --> 17:21.832
- You get really good service here.
- Yeah, I do.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.335
- Gotta go.
- Anything wrong?

17:25.460 --> 17:28.463
- Too much yeast, too little bowl.
- Enough said.

17:28.505 --> 17:31.800
I think I'm gonna go for it
and wear the fur-trimmed skating skirt...

17:31.883 --> 17:32.968
pride be damned.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.846
What if we invite Max
to go skating with us?

17:35.929 --> 17:38.432
- Max?
- Yeah, I thought he'd wanna go.

17:38.515 --> 17:40.434
When did you start calling him Max?

17:40.517 --> 17:44.271
The other night, he said I should call him
something other than Mr. Medina...

17:44.354 --> 17:46.773
when we're outside school,
which makes sense.

17:46.857 --> 17:48.984
So I'm getting used to saying Max.

17:49.025 --> 17:51.319
You don't see him that much
outside school.

17:51.403 --> 17:54.906
No, but I probably will, since you guys
are obsessed with each other.

17:54.990 --> 17:57.951
- I wouldn't say obsessed.
- No, it's okay.

17:58.034 --> 18:01.163
Of all the guys to have hanging around,
he seems like a good choice.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.248
- I like him.
- That's good.

18:04.332 --> 18:06.835
- So what do you think about the skating?
- What?

18:06.918 --> 18:09.171
Mr. Medina. I'm sorry, Max.

18:09.713 --> 18:12.757
- Do you think he'd wanna go?
- I don't think he skates.

18:12.841 --> 18:15.093
Maybe we could do
something else together.

18:15.177 --> 18:16.219
Yeah, good.

18:16.553 --> 18:19.514
Something else is good.
I love something else.

18:23.393 --> 18:25.312
Okay, the tea is ready.

18:28.356 --> 18:30.358
- How are the feet?
- I don't know.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.445
- They stopped talking to me.
- What on earth were you thinking?

18:33.528 --> 18:36.323
- That I could still skate.
- It's not like riding a bike.

18:36.406 --> 18:40.201
- Now you tell me.
- So, what are you up to tonight?

18:41.286 --> 18:44.456
I'm gonna do a little line dancing,
then run 10 km...

18:44.539 --> 18:47.500
and then just jump up and down
really hard for an hour.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.878
No Max? Taking the night off?

18:50.128 --> 18:53.131
- I don't see him every night.
- He seems like a great guy.

18:53.214 --> 18:55.216
- He is.
- That didn't sound convincing.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.595
No, he is. He is a great guy for someone.

18:59.095 --> 19:00.430
- For someone?
- Yes.

19:00.513 --> 19:02.265
- Someone else?
- Yes.

19:02.432 --> 19:06.686
Someone who's not you, although you're
the person spending every hour with him?

19:06.770 --> 19:07.896
Right.

19:09.147 --> 19:11.691
- How long have you been dating?
- Why?

19:11.775 --> 19:14.527
- Two months you've been seeing him?
- Point, Sookie.

19:14.611 --> 19:18.740
- You're just right on schedule, that's all.
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

19:18.782 --> 19:21.242
About now is when you start
doing your getaway dance.

19:21.284 --> 19:23.495
Two months, right on the nose.
You're good.

19:23.578 --> 19:26.373
- I do not do a dance.
- You're cha-cha-chaing right now.

19:26.456 --> 19:29.209
I'm not cha-cha-chaing. I'm being practical.

19:29.292 --> 19:32.921
Rory is starting to get attached to Max,
and that's not good.

19:32.962 --> 19:35.632
- Rory's getting attached to Max?
- Yes.

19:35.715 --> 19:39.719
And since I've decided
that Max is probably not the guy for me...

19:39.803 --> 19:42.931
I think it's better that we break it off
before she gets hurt.

19:43.014 --> 19:44.641
- Practical.
- Yes.

19:44.724 --> 19:47.102
- Can I say something here?
- Of course you can.

19:47.143 --> 19:49.145
- Cha-cha-cha.
- Stop that.

19:53.650 --> 19:56.653
You will not stand there
singing Ricky Martin songs to me.

19:56.695 --> 19:58.363
This is not a pattern, okay?

19:58.446 --> 20:01.574
I'm not doing what I always do.
This is not the same.

20:01.658 --> 20:02.992
Actually, you're right.

20:03.034 --> 20:07.247
Usually you don't get so upset
and defensive during the cha-cha talk.

20:08.123 --> 20:10.125
You must really like this guy.

20:10.208 --> 20:12.168
When did you become
the relationship expert?

20:12.252 --> 20:15.171
You haven't been in a relationship
in years.

20:17.173 --> 20:21.010
- Zero to jackass in 3.2 seconds.
- That's all right. Your feet hurt.

20:21.052 --> 20:24.681
No, it isn't. It is never ever okay
for me to talk to you like that.

20:24.764 --> 20:26.933
I'm so sorry. Please, honey.

20:27.934 --> 20:29.769
I understand. Really.

20:29.936 --> 20:33.273
- It's not like I don't want a relationship.
- I know.

20:33.523 --> 20:35.066
I didn't mean anything by it.

20:35.150 --> 20:36.526
It's hard with my hours.

20:36.568 --> 20:39.863
I'm always at the Inn,
the market or the hospital.

20:39.946 --> 20:41.865
Please, forgive me.

20:43.074 --> 20:46.161
Do you wanna sing some more
Ricky Martin to me?

20:46.911 --> 20:48.580
- No.
- You can.

20:50.081 --> 20:51.541
I deserve it.

21:05.305 --> 21:08.850
I heard Paris' dad has actually got
a second family in Paris.

21:13.021 --> 21:14.814
I enjoyed your paper on Dickinson.

21:14.898 --> 21:16.691
- I had fun writing it.
- It showed.

21:16.774 --> 21:18.776
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

21:19.986 --> 21:21.404
- Rory?
- Yeah?

21:24.240 --> 21:27.118
No, that's it. That's all I wanted to say.

21:27.869 --> 21:29.370
- My name?
- Yes.

21:30.246 --> 21:33.374
- Okay.
- Actually I just wanted to see...

21:35.376 --> 21:37.879
if your mom is coming to Parents' Day.

21:38.838 --> 21:42.884
Because I'm just trying to get
an accurate number of parents...

21:43.593 --> 21:45.136
who are coming...

21:45.220 --> 21:47.013
for the cookie count.

21:49.599 --> 21:50.934
Forget it.

21:51.100 --> 21:54.062
- She's coming.
- I hadn't heard from her in a while...

21:54.103 --> 21:56.356
- She'll be here.
- Okay, good.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.903
But you should put us down for four.

22:02.111 --> 22:04.238
- Four what?
- Four cookies.

22:05.114 --> 22:06.866
Okay, good. I will.

22:08.701 --> 22:09.786
Bye.

22:15.708 --> 22:18.252
Four slices, pepperoni pizza.

22:18.419 --> 22:20.046
- From?
- Tuesday.

22:20.296 --> 22:23.216
- Last Tuesday?
- Tuesday in the not-too-distant past.

22:23.299 --> 22:24.509
Toss it.

22:27.345 --> 22:29.097
You remember Paris Geller?

22:29.138 --> 22:30.932
Your very best friend in the whole world?

22:31.015 --> 22:33.977
- Her parents are getting a major divorce.
- Really?

22:34.018 --> 22:36.896
Her dad's this bigwig
at a huge pharmaceutical company...

22:36.980 --> 22:40.066
and they're printing all the sordid details
about it in the paper.

22:40.149 --> 22:42.568
- How sordid?
- It's not the Rick James incident...

22:42.652 --> 22:45.321
but Hugh Grant should be feeling
pretty good about himself.

22:45.405 --> 22:48.282
If she was anybody else,
I might feel bad for her.

22:48.324 --> 22:49.951
I kind of do feel bad for her.

22:49.992 --> 22:52.995
That's because you're the nicest kid
ever to walk the earth.

22:53.037 --> 22:54.956
The whole school's talking about it.

22:54.997 --> 22:58.000
The weird thing is that
the whole dynamic has changed for me.

22:58.084 --> 22:59.460
Really? How so?

22:59.794 --> 23:02.714
Madeline and Louise, Paris' best friends...

23:02.964 --> 23:05.508
they said hello to me the other day.

23:05.675 --> 23:09.137
Really? Like a normal hello,
not like a 'Here's Johnny' kind of hello?

23:09.178 --> 23:11.681
Normal, friendly, no acts.

23:11.806 --> 23:14.225
- You're the new Heather.
- I guess.

23:18.479 --> 23:21.065
This is the pizza from mystery Tuesday.

23:21.149 --> 23:23.234
That one's completely fine.

23:23.693 --> 23:25.194
- Don't.
- It's in the box.

23:25.236 --> 23:26.279
- Oscar.
- Felix.

23:26.362 --> 23:27.989
- Forget it.
- Fine.

23:30.241 --> 23:33.327
- So, how's Swann's Way coming?
- Finished.

23:33.411 --> 23:35.538
You're kidding.
It took me forever to read that.

23:35.621 --> 23:36.789
I had to renew it 10 times.

23:36.873 --> 23:39.333
The first sentence.
I finished the first sentence.

23:39.375 --> 23:41.752
It's just... I'm so swamped right now.

23:41.836 --> 23:45.590
It's the wrong time to start reading
the longest book known to man.

23:45.673 --> 23:47.675
Maybe you could
give it back to Max for me.

23:47.758 --> 23:48.885
Bring it with you tomorrow.

23:48.968 --> 23:50.511
- Tomorrow?
- Parents' Day.

23:50.553 --> 23:53.848
I know. I'm not sure
I'm gonna be able to make it.

23:54.056 --> 23:56.476
- What do you mean?
- I have that thing at the Inn...

23:56.559 --> 23:58.728
and I thought I could get away,
but now I can't.

23:58.811 --> 24:01.147
- What thing?
- The Inn thing.

24:01.230 --> 24:02.690
- What Inn thing?
- You know.

24:02.773 --> 24:04.025
No, I don't.

24:04.066 --> 24:08.905
The thing at the Inn with the flags
and the little men and the peanuts.

24:08.988 --> 24:09.989
Little men?

24:10.072 --> 24:13.117
Forget it. It's not important.
I just don't think I can go.

24:13.201 --> 24:14.577
Okay, fine.

24:14.619 --> 24:19.540
So if you could give this book back to Max
tomorrow that would be great.

24:19.582 --> 24:21.334
Give it back the next time you see him.

24:21.417 --> 24:24.212
I'm not sure when that will be,
and he should have his book.

24:24.253 --> 24:28.174
- You see him all the time.
- Could you just give it back to him?

24:29.425 --> 24:32.261
- Are you breaking up with him?
- What are you talking about?

24:32.345 --> 24:35.514
He hasn't heard from you,
and you're asking me to return the book.

24:35.598 --> 24:36.933
How do you know that?

24:37.016 --> 24:39.560
He wanted to know
if you were going to Parents' Day...

24:39.644 --> 24:42.063
and then he mentioned
you guys hadn't talked lately.

24:42.104 --> 24:43.814
He shouldn't be asking you about me.

24:43.898 --> 24:47.193
- Why are you breaking up with him?
- Because it's not working out.

24:47.276 --> 24:50.404
- But you seem so happy.
- It's not right, that's all.

24:50.488 --> 24:52.073
That's why you're not going tomorrow?

24:52.156 --> 24:54.617
No, I'm not going
because of the thing at the Inn.

24:54.700 --> 24:57.912
That's crap and you know it.
There is no thing at the Inn.

24:57.954 --> 25:00.790
You're avoiding Mr. Medina,
and you're trying to lie to me...

25:00.873 --> 25:02.959
and you promised you would go.

25:03.042 --> 25:06.003
Do whatever you want. I don't care.
Just leave me out of it.

25:06.087 --> 25:07.797
And give him the book back yourself.

25:07.880 --> 25:09.590
Fine, I will.

25:17.473 --> 25:19.558
- Not so fast.
- The bell's gonna ring.

25:19.642 --> 25:22.186
Before you go one more step,
tell me you still like me.

25:22.269 --> 25:24.230
- You bug me.
- I'll take that as a yes.

25:24.313 --> 25:26.816
I will deal with my issues
with Max myself.

25:26.899 --> 25:27.942
- Fine.
- Really.

25:28.025 --> 25:29.527
I believe you.

25:29.610 --> 25:30.987
So, where are we going?

25:31.070 --> 25:33.280
To my locker to drop off some of this stuff.

25:33.364 --> 25:34.699
Great, let's do it.

25:34.782 --> 25:37.618
- You can't just leave now.
- Paris, please.

25:37.785 --> 25:40.997
- At least come to my Lit. Class.
- This place is giving me a headache.

25:41.163 --> 25:42.790
- Is your face breaking out?
- No.

25:42.873 --> 25:44.792
You have not been using that cleanser.

25:44.834 --> 25:47.962
Dr. Yanalari prescribed that cleanser
for a reason: To cleanse.

25:48.004 --> 25:49.547
Just Lit. Class.

25:49.630 --> 25:52.466
Paris, with everything
I have going on right now...

25:52.508 --> 25:55.970
the last thing I need to do
is face people gossiping about me.

25:56.053 --> 25:59.682
See you later at home.
Use that cover stick I got you.

26:04.103 --> 26:06.313
I bet I'm looking pretty good to you
right now.

26:06.397 --> 26:07.857
Yes, you are.

26:09.066 --> 26:11.110
What's first? Wait, don't tell me.

26:11.193 --> 26:13.070
English Lit. With Mr. Max Medina.

26:13.154 --> 26:16.407
- Okay, see, I told you not to tell me.
- Sorry.

26:16.615 --> 26:19.952
- Mr. Medina's class?
- The fancy book owner himself.

26:20.035 --> 26:22.621
How does First Annual
Mother-Daughter Ditch Day sound?

26:22.705 --> 26:24.290
- Not happening.
- Yeah.

26:24.373 --> 26:25.583
Let's go.

26:25.666 --> 26:28.961
On Monday, we will start
a two-week exercise in creative writing...

26:29.044 --> 26:31.172
but that doesn't mean we stop reading.

26:31.213 --> 26:32.798
One of the greatest inspirations...

26:32.882 --> 26:35.718
for working writers
is the writing of others that they admire.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.846
Walt Whitman read Homer,
Dante, Shakespeare...

26:39.054 --> 26:41.682
and the novelist Edna O'Brien
has been quoted as saying...

26:41.766 --> 26:45.019
that every writer should read
some Proust every day.

26:45.060 --> 26:47.521
Now, at this point, normally...

26:48.189 --> 26:52.693
I would impress the parents by pulling out
a copy of Proust's Swann's Way...

26:52.735 --> 26:56.363
and reading a particularly difficult
passage, but, alas, you're all saved.

26:56.405 --> 26:58.324
I've misplaced my copy.

26:58.574 --> 27:01.577
That does it.
Parents, thank you for coming.

27:01.660 --> 27:03.704
Students, papers on Whitman
are due tomorrow...

27:03.787 --> 27:06.040
and those of you
who are just starting tonight...

27:06.123 --> 27:07.917
I'll be able to tell.

27:14.882 --> 27:17.927
You go on ahead, okay?
I'm gonna talk to Max for a second.

27:18.010 --> 27:19.970
- Please be nice.
- I will.

27:29.730 --> 27:31.899
- It's nice to see you.
- Yeah.

27:33.484 --> 27:36.987
- I've been really busy.
- Sure, I assumed.

27:37.404 --> 27:39.865
I wanted to give this back to you.

27:40.616 --> 27:42.743
- Keep it.
- I really liked it.

27:42.826 --> 27:45.454
I liked the first 20 pages,
and then I got busy...

27:45.538 --> 27:48.249
and I can see you really need it, so...

27:48.290 --> 27:50.084
What's going on, Lorelai?

27:50.125 --> 27:52.461
Nothing, I just don't think a book...

27:52.544 --> 27:55.130
whose first sentence is 20 pages long
is for me.

27:55.214 --> 27:58.425
- I left four messages.
- I know. I've been meaning to call.

27:58.467 --> 28:01.178
- What's been keeping you?
- I don't know.

28:02.263 --> 28:04.306
Things. Sorry.

28:04.640 --> 28:06.934
- Sorry?
- That I didn't call.

28:11.021 --> 28:12.022
Here.

28:12.106 --> 28:13.941
Why do you keep trying to
give me the book?

28:14.024 --> 28:15.109
Because it's yours.

28:15.150 --> 28:18.195
Is there something going on here
that I don't know about?

28:18.279 --> 28:19.947
Yeah, I hate Proust.

28:20.864 --> 28:23.534
Rory's out there waiting for me so...

28:24.868 --> 28:29.039
Wait a minute. Oh, my God.
I cannot believe what an idiot I am.

28:29.123 --> 28:31.583
- What?
- You're breaking up with me, aren't you?

28:31.667 --> 28:32.793
I don't know.

28:32.835 --> 28:35.629
Not only are you breaking up with me,
you're doing it badly.

28:35.671 --> 28:37.756
- Am I being graded?
- I'm a little disappointed.

28:37.840 --> 28:39.842
I would've expected
a better dumping from you.

28:39.925 --> 28:41.468
Nobody's dumping anybody.

28:41.552 --> 28:45.264
- Really? Then what is this?
- I just need space.

28:45.347 --> 28:46.557
I don't.

28:46.682 --> 28:49.351
In fact, I want as little space as possible.

28:49.435 --> 28:51.437
A hundred clowns
crammed into a Volkswagen.

28:51.520 --> 28:54.231
That's the kind of non-space
I'm talking about.

28:54.314 --> 28:55.315
It's not working.

28:55.399 --> 28:57.234
It was working pretty good
the other night.

28:57.317 --> 28:59.695
It is what I've been trying to tell you
all along.

28:59.778 --> 29:01.613
This is a family, Rory and I.

29:01.697 --> 29:03.615
But you weren't listening...

29:03.699 --> 29:07.077
and now she's getting attached,
and I'm afraid she's gonna get hurt.

29:07.161 --> 29:09.621
Your solution to all of this
is not to return my calls?

29:09.705 --> 29:12.374
It just took me a while
to figure things out...

29:12.458 --> 29:16.545
and it all came clear when I realized
how much we could hurt Rory.

29:16.920 --> 29:19.757
Don't you mean
'How much we could hurt Lorelai'?

29:19.840 --> 29:21.800
I can take care of myself.

29:21.884 --> 29:24.595
I don't understand this.
I thought we went through this.

29:24.678 --> 29:26.847
We decided that Rory could handle it.

29:26.930 --> 29:30.517
Maybe she can and maybe she can't,
but I'm not ready to find out.

29:30.601 --> 29:32.019
I won't let you off that easily.

29:32.061 --> 29:33.645
There's nothing you can do about it.

29:33.729 --> 29:35.063
- There has to be.
- There isn't.

29:35.147 --> 29:36.482
- There is.
- No, there isn't.

29:36.565 --> 29:39.109
- Yes, there is.
- What are we, in high school?

29:39.193 --> 29:41.361
I know we are in high school.

29:41.487 --> 29:43.238
This is so not you.

29:44.072 --> 29:47.159
- You don't know everything about me.
- I guess not.

29:47.242 --> 29:49.787
Because I would've thought
that blaming this on Rory...

29:49.870 --> 29:53.749
and giving me these lame apologies
was weak, pathetic, and beneath you.

29:53.791 --> 29:55.667
Just take your damn book.

29:55.751 --> 29:57.628
- You've missed me.
- Stop it.

29:57.711 --> 30:01.256
I know you did.
You're missing me right now, aren't you?

30:01.423 --> 30:03.383
- Answer me.
- Class is over.

30:03.425 --> 30:04.468
We're back in session.

30:04.551 --> 30:07.513
I didn't raise my hand, so don't call on me!

30:09.264 --> 30:12.351
I came here to give you this book back.
Please take it.

30:12.434 --> 30:16.438
I swear to God, if you try to
give me that book one more time...

31:07.197 --> 31:08.490
What's going on?

31:08.991 --> 31:13.120
Everyone's just talking about the mom
Mr. Medina was seen kissing just now.

31:13.161 --> 31:14.246
What?

31:14.329 --> 31:17.165
And the weird thing is
she looks a lot like your mom.

31:17.207 --> 31:18.583
What are you talking about?

31:18.667 --> 31:22.296
Your mom, Mr. Medina, mouths open.
I saw them.

31:23.255 --> 31:25.257
How's the coleslaw? Good?

31:31.346 --> 31:33.807
Did you save me some Jell-O? What?

31:43.442 --> 31:44.985
Where are you going?

31:45.068 --> 31:46.820
Were you kissing him?

31:46.862 --> 31:47.863
What?

31:47.946 --> 31:50.782
Mr. Medina, just now.
Were you kissing him?

31:51.158 --> 31:52.159
Yes.

31:52.451 --> 31:54.911
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- I don't know.

31:54.995 --> 31:57.205
- You said you were breaking up with him.
- I was.

31:57.289 --> 32:00.334
I told you to be nice, but this was extreme,
don't you think?

32:00.375 --> 32:02.669
It wasn't supposed to happen.

32:02.711 --> 32:05.464
Paris saw you. It's all over the school!

32:05.672 --> 32:09.676
Oh, God. I'm so sorry, I really am.

32:10.177 --> 32:14.056
See, this is exactly why
I didn't wanna date him.

32:14.139 --> 32:17.517
So you wouldn't come to my school
and kiss him and humiliate me?

32:17.559 --> 32:20.479
- Yes, that's exactly it.
- Why would you do this?

32:20.562 --> 32:23.940
Because I'm human.
Because I screwed up. I'm sorry.

32:24.024 --> 32:26.902
If you like him so much,
why are you breaking up with him?

32:26.985 --> 32:29.488
I broke the rules
when I brought him into our lives...

32:29.571 --> 32:32.282
and I realize now that
that was a very bad idea.

32:32.365 --> 32:33.450
But why?

32:33.533 --> 32:37.329
Because we are standing in this stairwell
yelling at each other, that's why.

32:37.412 --> 32:40.123
Because it's affecting you.
It's seeping into your life.

32:40.207 --> 32:44.252
That is the whole reason I made the rules
in the first place. To protect you.

32:44.336 --> 32:47.589
Maybe it was good that you
hid your personal life when I was a kid...

32:47.672 --> 32:49.007
but I'm not a kid anymore.

32:49.091 --> 32:52.052
No, you're right.
You're a 40-year-old divorcee. My mistake.

32:52.135 --> 32:55.388
- I can't believe you're blaming this on me!
- I'm not blaming you!

32:55.472 --> 32:56.932
You made up these stupid rules...

32:56.973 --> 32:59.434
about the way the Gilmore women
would run their lives.

32:59.476 --> 33:02.103
Now you're following them
even though they're crazy.

33:02.187 --> 33:05.732
My crazy, stupid rules are the reason
we are doing so good in our lives!

33:05.816 --> 33:07.984
They're the reason you grew up
the way you did...

33:08.068 --> 33:09.569
the reason you're in this school...

33:09.653 --> 33:11.613
and the reason
you're going to go to Harvard.

33:11.655 --> 33:14.741
- So don't you dismiss my rules!
- Fine. Great.

33:14.825 --> 33:17.285
Maybe it's time for the rules to change.

33:17.369 --> 33:19.871
That is for me to figure out, not you!

33:19.955 --> 33:21.498
Great. Fine.

33:21.581 --> 33:23.458
Could you figure it out
before French class?

33:23.542 --> 33:26.211
I'd rather you didn't start making out
with Mrs. Collins.

33:26.294 --> 33:29.172
No promises
until I see what she looks like.

33:31.341 --> 33:34.553
Let's refrain from fighting
in front of the grandma.

33:34.636 --> 33:36.096
Fine with me.

33:36.137 --> 33:40.100
The last thing I need tonight
is a confrontation with my mother.

33:42.769 --> 33:43.895
Hi, Mom.

33:45.313 --> 33:48.316
Boy, the roads were a mess
out there tonight.

33:50.360 --> 33:52.946
- Rory, go upstairs please.
- Is everything okay?

33:52.988 --> 33:55.282
I have to talk to your mother.
Please go upstairs.

33:55.699 --> 33:57.075
Now, Rory.

34:02.998 --> 34:04.791
Lorelai, come here.

34:05.917 --> 34:07.961
Did I do something wrong?

34:08.335 --> 34:10.922
I try to understand you. I truly do.

34:11.005 --> 34:13.717
But sometimes your behavior
baffles me beyond belief.

34:13.800 --> 34:16.636
- Which behavior is this?
- Do you have no shame?

34:16.678 --> 34:18.972
Is that a rhetorical question?

34:19.054 --> 34:22.475
Rory goes to school in that place.
She has a reputation to protect.

34:22.516 --> 34:24.351
- You're her mother.
- How did you...

34:24.436 --> 34:26.938
You're supposed to shield her from shame,
not cause it.

34:27.022 --> 34:28.315
How, Mom?

34:28.356 --> 34:32.277
Kissing a teacher, in a classroom,
on Parents' Day?

34:32.360 --> 34:35.196
They wanted us to get more involved
with the school.

34:35.280 --> 34:36.364
Are you insane?

34:36.447 --> 34:39.367
No, but you are
if you think I am discussing this with you.

34:39.451 --> 34:42.495
- When I heard I almost fainted.
- How did you hear?

34:42.536 --> 34:45.915
I have friends.
Headmaster Charleston's wife for one.

34:45.998 --> 34:47.583
That's great.

34:47.667 --> 34:51.463
The entire school is talking about it.
And what do I say? How do I defend this?

34:51.545 --> 34:53.965
- It was a mistake.
- A mistake?

34:54.049 --> 34:56.009
Is that what you call it?

34:56.092 --> 34:59.095
I tried to call it Al,
but it would only answer to mistake.

34:59.179 --> 35:01.639
A mistake is
when you throw out your credit card bill.

35:01.723 --> 35:04.184
A mistake is when you forget to RSVP
to a dinner party.

35:04.267 --> 35:06.436
A mistake is when the gardeners
miss trash day...

35:06.519 --> 35:10.148
and the barrels are full for a week.
This, my girl, was not a mistake.

35:10.231 --> 35:13.568
- Do you even know this man?
- No, this is the first time I'd seen him...

35:13.651 --> 35:16.363
there was just something
about the way he held the chalk...

35:16.404 --> 35:18.031
This is not the time for your jokes.

35:18.073 --> 35:20.700
Yes, I knew him. I've been dating him.

35:20.784 --> 35:22.744
Why on earth would you date
Rory's teacher?

35:22.827 --> 35:25.288
- That is none of your business.
- It most certainly is.

35:25.372 --> 35:26.414
How do you figure that?

35:26.498 --> 35:28.792
When it affects my granddaughter
it is my business.

35:28.875 --> 35:31.544
I don't wanna talk about this with you.

35:31.753 --> 35:33.671
I just wanna know
what you were thinking.

35:33.755 --> 35:37.717
What was the reasoning?
How on earth did you justify it to yourself?

35:37.801 --> 35:39.552
Max is a great guy.

35:41.096 --> 35:42.680
An amazing guy.

35:43.223 --> 35:45.558
He's smart. He's sweet.

35:47.977 --> 35:49.062
He cooks.

35:49.104 --> 35:51.523
So you decided to kiss him
in your daughter's school.

35:51.606 --> 35:54.818
No, I decided to break up with him
in my daughter's school...

35:54.901 --> 35:57.153
and the kissing part just happened.

35:57.237 --> 35:59.781
You always let your emotions
get in the way.

35:59.864 --> 36:03.243
That's the problem with you, Lorelai.
You don't think.

36:03.284 --> 36:04.869
Mom, please.

36:04.953 --> 36:07.914
- He's just a man, Lorelai.
- No, he's not.

36:07.997 --> 36:12.335
Are you telling me this was all worth it
because he was the love of your life?

36:12.418 --> 36:14.629
That this was the man for you?

36:15.380 --> 36:16.881
I don't know.

36:17.298 --> 36:19.008
He might have been.

36:19.968 --> 36:21.261
Excuse me.

36:28.184 --> 36:30.520
I told you he wouldn't date a teacher.

36:30.603 --> 36:32.689
I wish my mom would
sleep with my teacher.

36:32.772 --> 36:35.275
It would make midterms a lot easier.

36:36.442 --> 36:38.403
Madeline, Louise, excuse us for a minute.

36:38.486 --> 36:40.947
- Catfight.
- Go!

36:43.324 --> 36:44.909
You're not going to kiss me, are you?

36:44.993 --> 36:47.370
- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing, I'm great.

36:47.453 --> 36:48.913
You've spent the past two weeks...

36:48.997 --> 36:51.875
with your family's private problems
printed in the newspaper...

36:51.958 --> 36:53.626
for everyone to read and talk about.

36:53.668 --> 36:57.130
I saw how you walked around here.
I saw how much you hated it...

36:57.213 --> 36:59.465
and then you pull something like this?

36:59.507 --> 37:01.175
Doesn't that seem crazy to you?

37:01.259 --> 37:03.720
Do you have any idea
how many people you've hurt?

37:03.803 --> 37:06.097
Forget me and my mom.
What about Mr. Medina?

37:06.180 --> 37:07.807
He likes you. He encourages you.

37:07.891 --> 37:11.728
He holds up your papers
and tells the class how great you are.

37:12.604 --> 37:16.065
And then you turn around
and spread stories about him.

37:16.524 --> 37:20.236
Whatever. Forget it.
You have no idea what I'm talking about.

37:20.320 --> 37:22.155
I do like Mr. Medina.

37:22.322 --> 37:23.990
I'd take some dance classes...

37:24.032 --> 37:27.619
because the way you express yourself
needs a little work.

37:28.161 --> 37:31.873
I probably shouldn't have told people
what I saw.

37:31.956 --> 37:34.500
- No, you shouldn't have.
- I'm sorry.

37:35.877 --> 37:40.173
Things have been not good lately.

37:40.381 --> 37:41.341
I know.

37:41.424 --> 37:45.219
I just didn't want them
talking about me anymore, that's all.

37:45.845 --> 37:48.181
- It worked.
- Yeah.

37:49.766 --> 37:53.019
- Lf you ever wanna talk...
- We are not friends.

37:53.061 --> 37:54.520
That I know.

37:55.313 --> 37:59.650
But if you ever do want to talk about...

37:59.734 --> 38:01.819
I will, if I want to.

38:02.820 --> 38:05.239
- Okay.
- But I probably won't.

38:06.532 --> 38:08.910
- That's fine.
- But if I do...

38:08.993 --> 38:11.204
- I'm around.
- Okay.

38:12.830 --> 38:14.165
I'm going now.

38:14.248 --> 38:15.917
- Bye.
- Bye.

38:20.421 --> 38:21.964
I doubt I will.

38:22.590 --> 38:24.675
I'm not holding my breath.

38:32.308 --> 38:34.769
There. Squash blossoms.

38:35.269 --> 38:37.730
All large enough for you to stuff
and fry up...

38:37.772 --> 38:41.442
and serve to the desensitized masses
who just want what they know.

38:41.526 --> 38:43.903
Hurrah! Mediocrity wins again.

38:44.821 --> 38:46.948
I'm not even gonna charge you for these.

38:47.031 --> 38:49.534
I am not gonna profit off
the death of creativity.

38:49.617 --> 38:52.870
I would rather starve myself
than know that my food was paid for...

38:52.954 --> 38:55.248
by the lowered expectations
of the American public.

38:55.289 --> 38:57.333
- Jackson.
- What?

38:58.584 --> 39:01.295
Would you like to go to dinner sometime...

39:01.379 --> 39:02.588
with me?

39:04.423 --> 39:05.550
Okay.

39:17.770 --> 39:18.980
Thanks.

39:25.153 --> 39:27.655
Mister, wanna buy
a really nice copy of Proust?

39:27.738 --> 39:30.283
- How you doing?
- Well, you know.

39:30.366 --> 39:32.952
- You?
- I'm you-knowing also.

39:37.498 --> 39:39.333
That Parents' Day is fun.

39:40.126 --> 39:42.253
It was a big hit this year.

39:44.547 --> 39:48.175
Look, the other day,
we were going skating and Rory said:

39:48.342 --> 39:50.469
'Why don't we invite Max
to come along with us?'

39:50.553 --> 39:54.098
- That was a little weird for me.
- Me, too. I don't skate.

39:54.682 --> 39:58.311
She's never really referred to anyone
I've dated by their first name before.

39:58.352 --> 40:00.688
I've always kept her out
of that part of my life...

40:00.771 --> 40:02.732
so it was like 'the mustache guy'...

40:02.815 --> 40:05.359
'the earring guy,' 'the peg leg guy. '

40:05.443 --> 40:07.820
So you have a thing for pirates.

40:08.487 --> 40:11.657
She never called anyone
by their name before.

40:12.325 --> 40:13.868
She likes you.

40:14.410 --> 40:15.786
She likes us.

40:15.870 --> 40:19.373
So my mind instantly went to,
'What if we break up? She'll be crushed. '

40:19.457 --> 40:23.419
And then my next thought was,
'Oh, my God. What if we break up?

40:23.502 --> 40:27.173
'I'll be crushed. '
Then, as you know, all hell broke loose.

40:27.381 --> 40:28.716
I understand.

40:28.799 --> 40:31.177
I freaked out. I'm so sorry.

40:32.595 --> 40:34.680
I never meant to treat you like that.

40:34.722 --> 40:37.224
I'm not very good at this. Ask Skippy.

40:37.308 --> 40:40.478
- Skippy?
- I'm so sorry.

40:41.979 --> 40:44.690
I was called into
Headmaster Charleston's office today.

40:44.732 --> 40:46.942
Let me guess.
He put his arm around you and said:

40:47.026 --> 40:49.487
'I don't understand
why you kids can't work this out. '

40:49.570 --> 40:52.490
He said I was jeopardizing my career
and future at Chilton.

40:52.573 --> 40:56.243
At first I was incensed, outraged.
'How dare he?'

40:57.244 --> 40:59.747
And then I realized that he was right.

40:59.789 --> 41:02.958
What happened the other day
was completely unprofessional.

41:03.042 --> 41:07.171
I never in my life would have considered
pulling off something like this.

41:07.254 --> 41:08.381
He should've fired me.

41:08.422 --> 41:09.882
- But he didn't.
- Not yet.

41:09.924 --> 41:13.052
The word 'probation'
was tossed around quite a bit, though.

41:13.177 --> 41:15.805
- I'm sorry.
- I was the one who started the kiss.

41:15.888 --> 41:18.432
I'm the one who knocked it up to NC-17.

41:18.516 --> 41:21.435
I honestly did not think
this was going to be so complicated.

41:21.519 --> 41:22.520
I know.

41:22.603 --> 41:26.232
You told me it would be.
I didn't listen. I didn't want to.

41:26.941 --> 41:28.442
It's not your fault.

41:28.526 --> 41:31.404
If I hadn't acted like a two-year-old
and tried to run away...

41:31.445 --> 41:33.739
and pretend that you weren't
what you are to me...

41:33.823 --> 41:35.991
then we wouldn't have fought, or kissed...

41:36.075 --> 41:38.077
and I wouldn't have humiliated
my daughter...

41:38.160 --> 41:40.996
and the whole thing would have been fine.

41:43.666 --> 41:46.252
I do not know what to do here.

41:48.546 --> 41:51.674
I've never been
in a relationship like this before.

41:51.757 --> 41:54.802
- I'm not thinking straight.
- I know. Me either.

41:55.344 --> 41:58.013
- That was a great kiss.
- Beyond great.

42:00.766 --> 42:04.353
Maybe we need to
take a little time away from each other.

42:07.314 --> 42:08.441
Okay.

42:09.483 --> 42:11.277
Just to figure out...

42:11.694 --> 42:14.196
how to do this so it's not so hard.

42:14.655 --> 42:16.532
Sure, that makes sense.

42:17.700 --> 42:19.994
I don't have any other answers right now.

42:20.077 --> 42:22.454
No, you're absolutely right.

42:25.332 --> 42:27.626
I really, really like you, Max Medina.

42:29.003 --> 42:31.505
I really, really like you, Lorelai Gilmore.

42:32.965 --> 42:35.801
So long as we have that straightened out.

42:37.344 --> 42:38.971
Goodbye, Lorelai.

42:41.348 --> 42:42.433
Bye.

42:58.657 --> 43:00.326
Mom, I'm home!
