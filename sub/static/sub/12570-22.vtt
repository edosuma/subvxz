watching an awful movie,

07:57.083 --> 08:00.250
we play a quiz game?

08:01.334 --> 08:02.417
Ooh, fun!

08:02.459 --> 08:04.125
I am a bit of a quiz wiz.

08:04.167 --> 08:07.250
(LAUGHING) He said wiz.

08:09.918 --> 08:11.042
Okay.

08:11.083 --> 08:12.918
Question one,

08:12.959 --> 08:15.001
this Native American helped

08:15.002 --> 08:17.042
the pilgrims celebrate

08:12.959 --> 08:17.042
the first Thanksgiving.

08:17.083 --> 08:18.563
The correct answer

08:18.564 --> 08:20.042
is Squanto.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.042
Easy.

08:21.083 --> 08:22.500
Thank you.

08:25.083 --> 08:27.063
Question two.

08:27.064 --> 08:29.042
Three-fifths times

08:25.083 --> 08:29.042
one-third equals...

08:29.083 --> 08:30.626
Three-fifteenths,

08:30.627 --> 08:32.167
reduced to one fifth,

08:29.083 --> 08:32.167
obviously.

08:32.208 --> 08:34.101
- (CHUCKLES) - This game should come
- With a teething ring.

08:34.125 --> 08:36.042
(CHUCKLES)

08:36.082 --> 08:37.188
Okay,

08:37.188 --> 08:38.292
here's a tougher one.

08:38.333 --> 08:40.251
Use this word

08:40.251 --> 08:42.167
in a sentence,

08:38.333 --> 08:42.167
"incongruous."

08:42.208 --> 08:44.042
Very well.

08:44.082 --> 08:46.105
I find it incongruous

08:46.106 --> 08:48.125
that you are all pretending

08:44.082 --> 08:48.125
to cheer me up,

08:48.167 --> 08:50.292
just to exploit

08:50.293 --> 08:52.417
my brain yet again!

08:52.459 --> 08:54.251
Can you slow down?

08:54.252 --> 08:56.042
I didn't get all that.

08:56.083 --> 08:58.063
All I am to you people

08:58.064 --> 09:00.042
is a beast of

08:56.083 --> 09:00.042
academic burden!

09:00.083 --> 09:01.563
Is my IQ the only reason

09:01.564 --> 09:03.042
you hang out with me?

09:03.083 --> 09:05.042
Absolutely not!

09:05.083 --> 09:07.124
- We also hang out with you
- because you live here.

09:09.083 --> 09:10.250
That is it!

09:10.292 --> 09:12.042
- I am done doing
- your homework,

09:12.083 --> 09:13.376
And I am done

09:13.377 --> 09:14.667
with all of you.

09:17.500 --> 09:18.751
Wow, he was

09:18.752 --> 09:20.000
really incongruous.

09:21.250 --> 09:23.000
- I am so going to
- fail this test.

09:26.209 --> 09:27.251
Wow,

09:27.252 --> 09:28.292
you're really hungry.

09:28.334 --> 09:29.974
- When you get to
- the white thing, stop.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
It's the plate.

09:32.667 --> 09:34.147
Sorry, I haven't had

09:34.148 --> 09:35.626
any money to buy food today.

09:35.667 --> 09:37.355
Your butler really

09:37.356 --> 09:39.042
low-balled me on my towels.

09:39.083 --> 09:40.083
Well, you have been

09:40.084 --> 09:41.084
rich for 25 years,

09:41.125 --> 09:42.147
so it must be extra tough

09:42.148 --> 09:43.167
making ends meet.

09:43.209 --> 09:44.397
Mmm, speaking of meat,

09:44.398 --> 09:45.584
do you have any in there?

09:45.626 --> 09:47.043
Because I am this close

09:47.044 --> 09:48.459
to hunting squirrels.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.018
- (IN NEW YORK ACCENT)
- Forget about it.

09:50.042 --> 09:51.334
- New York squirrels
- are tough.

09:51.375 --> 09:53.022
Before you know it,

09:53.023 --> 09:54.667
you'll be their lunch.

09:54.709 --> 09:55.917
(IN NORMAL ACCENT)

09:55.918 --> 09:57.125
Oh, besides,

09:54.709 --> 09:57.125
I brought you this.

09:57.167 --> 09:58.251
(CHUCKLES)

09:58.252 --> 09:59.334
Just pace yourself.

09:59.375 --> 10:01.042
Thanks.

10:01.083 --> 10:03.584
(SIGHS) So,

10:03.626 --> 10:04.834
do you really miss

10:04.835 --> 10:06.042
working at the

10:03.626 --> 10:06.042
animal sanctuary?

10:06.083 --> 10:08.000
Actually, yeah.

10:08.042 --> 10:09.251
We just saved an

10:09.252 --> 10:10.459
endangered fanged toad

10:08.042 --> 10:10.459
that spits acid.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.938
Oh. You know,

10:11.939 --> 10:13.375
some things are

10:10.500 --> 10:13.375
better off extinct.

10:14.417 --> 10:16.042
- No, you would love
- Fernando.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.042
- He's one of a kind.
- Literally.

10:19.167 --> 10:21.125
- (SIGHS) This is
- all my fault.

10:21.167 --> 10:22.230
Because of me,

10:22.231 --> 10:23.292
you lost your mother,

10:21.167 --> 10:23.292
your money,

10:23.334 --> 10:24.459
and your deadly

10:24.460 --> 10:25.584
Spanish toad.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.584
No, it's not your fault.

10:28.209 --> 10:29.709
It's my mother's.

10:29.751 --> 10:31.417
And anyway, you're worth it.

10:34.042 --> 10:36.000
Jessie, I love you.

10:38.083 --> 10:39.563
(CHUCKLES) Oh, Brooks,

10:39.564 --> 10:41.042
I love you too.

10:41.083 --> 10:42.355
I just want you

10:42.356 --> 10:43.626
to be as happy as

10:41.083 --> 10:43.626
you've made me.

10:43.667 --> 10:45.375
And I will be,

10:45.376 --> 10:47.083
once I get used to

10:43.667 --> 10:47.083
this new job.

10:47.125 --> 10:48.726
- Well, that's the
- elevator biz for ya.

10:48.751 --> 10:50.459
Full of ups and downs.

10:52.083 --> 10:53.393
- Seriously, you're gonna
- have to learn to appreciate

10:53.417 --> 10:54.538
- This kind of humor.
- Okay.

10:56.083 --> 10:57.500

11:08.083 --> 11:09.584
Oh, uh, here.

11:09.626 --> 11:11.375

- Got that for you.

11:32.083 --> 11:33.083
(ALARM BLARING)

12:00.083 --> 12:01.083
Hey, Tony.

12:01.084 --> 12:02.084
Aw, Brooks,

12:02.125 --> 12:03.584
you didn't have to

12:03.585 --> 12:05.042
get me flowers.

12:05.083 --> 12:06.397
Sorry, bro.

12:06.398 --> 12:07.709
These are for Jessie.

12:07.751 --> 12:09.083
She's so awesome!

12:09.125 --> 12:10.272
Seriously,

12:10.273 --> 12:11.417
I don't know how you

12:09.125 --> 12:11.417
ever let her go.

12:11.459 --> 12:12.584
Yeah, I've been

12:12.585 --> 12:13.709
getting that a lot lately.

12:13.751 --> 12:15.438
From you, Emma,

12:15.439 --> 12:17.125
Zuri, my ballet teacher.

12:19.083 --> 12:20.563
What? Can't a guy

12:20.564 --> 12:22.042
have a hobby?

12:22.083 --> 12:23.459
And how can you afford

12:23.460 --> 12:24.834
such beautiful flowers

12:22.083 --> 12:24.834
on your salary?

12:24.876 --> 12:26.063
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

12:26.064 --> 12:27.250
(CHUCKLES) They're free,

12:24.876 --> 12:27.250
at the cemetery.

12:28.584 --> 12:30.042
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

12:30.083 --> 12:31.542
- Hi, Tony.
- Hey, girls.

12:32.209 --> 12:33.626
You were right.

12:33.667 --> 12:35.043
You have to be

12:35.044 --> 12:36.417
more specific.

12:33.667 --> 12:36.417
We're right a lot.

12:38.083 --> 12:39.584
I mean about Jessie.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.586
- I think I might - still have feelings
- For her.

12:41.626 --> 12:42.751
Well, duh!

12:42.792 --> 12:44.167
Everyone knows that.

12:44.209 --> 12:45.209
Even the weird shut-in

12:45.210 --> 12:46.210
on the sixth floor.

12:48.375 --> 12:50.083
She texts.

12:50.125 --> 12:51.334
So, what should I do?

12:51.375 --> 12:53.083
- Tell Jessie
- how you feel!

12:53.125 --> 12:54.626
It might be too late.

12:54.667 --> 12:56.468
- I think she's totally
- in love with Brooks.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.626
But you can't let her

12:57.627 --> 12:58.751
end up with him.

12:58.792 --> 13:00.730
He's just a pretty boy

13:00.731 --> 13:02.667
with great hair

12:58.792 --> 13:02.667
and a uniform!

13:02.709 --> 13:03.855
Hey, you just

13:03.856 --> 13:05.000
described me!

13:06.626 --> 13:07.813
What can I say?

13:07.814 --> 13:09.000
The woman has a type.

13:31.918 --> 13:33.334
Ah-ha!

13:33.375 --> 13:35.042
- (SCREAMS)
- (GRUNTS)

13:35.083 --> 13:36.584
(PANTING)

13:36.626 --> 13:38.083
Were you following me?

13:38.125 --> 13:39.042
No.

13:39.083 --> 13:40.500
(GRUNTING)

13:42.083 --> 13:43.209
Don't lie.

13:43.210 --> 13:44.334
My dad trained me

13:42.083 --> 13:44.334
in counterintelligence.

13:44.375 --> 13:46.101
- Although, considering
- it's you who's tailing me,

13:46.125 --> 13:47.604
There's not a lot of

13:47.605 --> 13:49.083
intelligence to counter.

13:49.125 --> 13:51.375
Rhoda made me do it.

13:51.417 --> 13:53.226
- She threatened to tell
- Morgan and Christina

13:53.250 --> 13:54.667
About the helicopter tours.

13:54.709 --> 13:55.855
The what?

13:55.856 --> 13:57.000
Okay, fine,

13:54.709 --> 13:57.000
I'll cut you in!

13:58.250 --> 13:59.918
Just give me some dirt to

13:59.919 --> 14:01.584
get that crone off my back.

14:01.626 --> 14:03.417
- Wait, she wants
- dirt on me? Why?

14:03.459 --> 14:04.668
To show Brooks,

14:04.669 --> 14:05.876
so he'll break up

14:03.459 --> 14:05.876
with you.

14:06.626 --> 14:09.292
(SCOFFS) That is so low!

14:09.334 --> 14:11.001
I can't believe she would

14:11.002 --> 14:12.667
stoop to enlisting a spy

14:09.334 --> 14:12.667
in my own home.

14:12.709 --> 14:13.731
You can't?

14:13.732 --> 14:14.751
This is the same woman

14:14.792 --> 14:16.643
- who wanted to - keep children
- Out of the building,

14:16.667 --> 14:17.897
Unless they

14:17.898 --> 14:19.125
were declawed.

14:19.167 --> 14:20.917
I mean, I thought for sure

14:20.918 --> 14:22.667
she'd eventually let Brooks

14:19.167 --> 14:22.667
have his old life back.

14:22.709 --> 14:24.168
He's her own

14:24.169 --> 14:25.626
flesh and blood,

14:22.709 --> 14:25.626
or whatever she's made of.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.772
That woman will stop

14:28.773 --> 14:30.042
at nothing to get

14:27.500 --> 14:30.042
what she wants.

14:30.083 --> 14:31.417
And that includes tickling.

14:31.459 --> 14:33.918
(SHUDDERS)

14:33.959 --> 14:35.564
So who cares?

14:35.565 --> 14:37.167
You guys are so

14:33.959 --> 14:37.167
happy and in love,

14:37.209 --> 14:38.501
and Brooks seems okay

14:38.502 --> 14:39.792
with his new life, right?

14:39.834 --> 14:41.626
Yeah, for now.

14:41.667 --> 14:42.980
But what about

14:42.981 --> 14:44.292
in a year,

14:44.334 --> 14:47.334
five years, 10 years?

14:47.375 --> 14:48.980
I mean, he...

14:48.981 --> 14:50.584
He's just gonna end up

14:47.375 --> 14:50.584
resenting me.

14:50.626 --> 14:52.792
I can't let that happen.

14:52.834 --> 14:55.125
So, what are you saying?

14:55.959 --> 14:57.792
I'm saying

14:57.834 --> 14:59.792
- I have to - love him enough
- To let him go.

15:01.500 --> 15:02.730
It's the best thing

15:02.731 --> 15:03.959
for him, and Fernando.

15:05.167 --> 15:06.250
He's got a kid?

15:07.834 --> 15:09.918
No, he's got a toad!

15:13.042 --> 15:14.521
Well, the good news is,

15:14.522 --> 15:16.000
I think she forgot about

15:13.042 --> 15:16.000
the helicopter thing.

15:21.250 --> 15:22.876
Hello, Bertie.

15:22.918 --> 15:24.083
Dessert's here.

15:28.083 --> 15:29.709
- And there goes
- my appetite.

15:31.500 --> 15:33.543
So, do you have

15:33.544 --> 15:35.584
anything juicy for me?

15:31.500 --> 15:35.584
Besides all that.

15:40.918 --> 15:42.626
Actually,

15:42.667 --> 15:43.814
there is something

15:43.815 --> 15:44.959
I dug up that you're

15:42.667 --> 15:44.959
going to want to see.

15:46.250 --> 15:47.417
(SCREAMS)

15:49.083 --> 15:50.542
My birth nose!

15:52.751 --> 15:54.667
Where did you find this?

15:54.709 --> 15:55.876
My plastic surgery

15:55.877 --> 15:57.042
records are sealed!

15:57.083 --> 15:59.059
- I know, because - I put them in
- A weighted sack

15:59.083 --> 16:00.459
And tossed them

16:00.460 --> 16:01.834
into the Hudson!

16:01.876 --> 16:03.375
- Along with my
- plastic surgeon.

16:04.626 --> 16:06.459
I called in a few favors.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.168
The Butler Underground

16:08.169 --> 16:09.834
is everywhere.

16:09.876 --> 16:11.272
And that picture is

16:11.273 --> 16:12.667
going to be plastered

16:09.876 --> 16:12.667
all over the building

16:12.709 --> 16:13.876
if you don't leave

16:13.877 --> 16:15.042
Jessie and Brooks alone.

16:15.083 --> 16:16.626
How could you

16:16.627 --> 16:18.167
betray me like this?

16:18.209 --> 16:19.251
Because Jessie

16:19.252 --> 16:20.292
is like family to me.

16:20.334 --> 16:21.918
- And families
- stick together.

16:21.959 --> 16:23.835
Blah, blah,

16:23.836 --> 16:25.709
blah, blah, blah.

16:25.751 --> 16:27.542
- I know what's best
- for my son,

16:27.584 --> 16:29.417
- Which is why
- I left him penniless!

16:29.459 --> 16:30.668
Which only showed him

16:30.669 --> 16:31.876
that Jessie loves him

16:29.459 --> 16:31.876
for who he is,

16:31.918 --> 16:33.042
and not what he has.

16:33.083 --> 16:34.522
If anything,

16:34.523 --> 16:35.959
you brought them

16:33.083 --> 16:35.959
closer together.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.042
(CHUCKLES)

16:37.083 --> 16:38.584
How revolting!

16:40.083 --> 16:41.792
- Rhoda, did you ever
- stop and think

16:41.834 --> 16:43.418
That maybe there is

16:43.419 --> 16:45.000
a reason why you've had

16:41.834 --> 16:45.000
six different husbands?

16:46.459 --> 16:48.563
Could it be that

16:48.564 --> 16:50.667
you've always married for

16:46.459 --> 16:50.667
money and never for love?

16:50.709 --> 16:52.105
I'll have you know

16:52.106 --> 16:53.500
I always married

16:50.709 --> 16:53.500
for love.

16:54.542 --> 16:57.334
The love of money!

16:57.375 --> 16:58.897
Maybe that's why you

16:58.898 --> 17:00.417
can't recognize true love

16:57.375 --> 17:00.417
when you see it.

17:02.334 --> 17:03.584
How can you just

17:03.585 --> 17:04.834
sit there, stone-faced?

17:04.876 --> 17:05.938
It's easy after

17:05.939 --> 17:07.000
five gallons of Botox.

17:09.083 --> 17:10.959
- LUKE: Ravi,
- get in here quick!

17:11.000 --> 17:12.291
It's an emergency!

17:13.083 --> 17:15.000
- Luke,
- for the billionth time,

17:15.041 --> 17:16.291
Losing the remote

17:16.292 --> 17:17.541
is not an emergency.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.939
You guys,

17:23.940 --> 17:25.876
you did all of this

17:22.000 --> 17:25.876
for me?

17:25.917 --> 17:27.041
Of course!

17:27.083 --> 17:28.667
It's Ravi Appreciation Day.

17:30.375 --> 17:31.688
Oh, that is why

17:31.689 --> 17:33.000
you wrote "R.A.D."

17:33.042 --> 17:34.521
I was afraid you were

17:34.522 --> 17:36.000
mocking my use

17:33.042 --> 17:36.000
of antiquated slang.

17:36.042 --> 17:37.501
Which would have been

17:37.502 --> 17:38.959
a stone-cold bummer.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.522
Oh, and you haven't seen

17:40.523 --> 17:42.042
the best part.

17:42.083 --> 17:43.230
For once,

17:43.231 --> 17:44.375
we did your homework.

17:44.417 --> 17:45.730
You completed

17:45.731 --> 17:47.042
my history report?

17:47.083 --> 17:48.334
Uh, but it is too late.

17:48.335 --> 17:49.584
No, it isn't.

17:49.626 --> 17:50.751
I gave your teacher

17:50.752 --> 17:51.876
a gently used tiara,

17:51.918 --> 17:53.518
- and she agreed to
- give you an extension.

17:53.542 --> 17:55.292
LUKE: Dude,

17:55.334 --> 17:57.014
- we didn't mean to
- take you for granted.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.042
Yeah, we love you.

18:00.083 --> 18:01.563
And we're sorry

18:01.564 --> 18:03.042
if we don't tell you

18:00.083 --> 18:03.042
that enough.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.542
Thank you.

18:04.543 --> 18:06.000
You guys are the best

18:03.083 --> 18:06.000

18:06.042 --> 18:07.042
Aww.

18:08.626 --> 18:10.334
And we're going to start

18:10.335 --> 18:12.042
doing our own homework

18:08.626 --> 18:12.042
from now on,

18:12.083 --> 18:13.397
because you're not our

18:13.398 --> 18:14.709
personal homework machine.

18:14.751 --> 18:15.897
Although, if you did

18:15.898 --> 18:17.042
wanna invent one of those,

18:17.083 --> 18:18.542
we'd be cool with that.

Brooks, I want you to know

18:23.000 --> 18:24.314
I have had the most

18:24.315 --> 18:25.626
amazing few months

18:23.000 --> 18:25.626
with you.

18:25.667 --> 18:27.355
Every minute you've been

18:27.356 --> 18:29.042
in my life has been

18:25.667 --> 18:29.042
incredible.

18:29.083 --> 18:30.563
Which is why

18:30.564 --> 18:32.042
it's so difficult say this.

18:32.083 --> 18:35.000
Jessie, I love you.

18:35.042 --> 18:36.313
Whatever it is,

18:36.314 --> 18:37.584
we can get through it

18:35.042 --> 18:37.584
together.

18:41.460 --> 18:42.460

19:11.023 --> 19:12.042
your money back,

as well as your job

19:13.564 --> 19:15.042
as head of the

animal sanctuary.

19:15.083 --> 19:16.230
You are?

19:16.231 --> 19:17.375
I can't wait to

19:15.083 --> 19:17.375
tell Fernando!

19:18.834 --> 19:20.356
Is this a trap?

19:20.357 --> 19:21.876
It feels like a trap.

19:21.918 --> 19:23.272
No. After talking

19:23.273 --> 19:24.626
with that beefcake

19:21.918 --> 19:24.626
of a butler,

19:24.667 --> 19:25.855
I realized that Jessie

19:25.856 --> 19:27.042
might be the one woman

in the world

I do.

more to me than the money.

helping out Brooks.
