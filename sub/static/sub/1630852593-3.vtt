00:08.920 --> 00:10.920
-<i>Boing.</i>
-<i>Hang on.</i>

00:11.640 --> 00:12.480
<i>Boing!</i>

00:14.640 --> 00:15.480
<i>Boing!</i>

00:16.400 --> 00:18.280
-<i>Do you think she likes it?</i>
-<i>Boing!</i>

00:18.360 --> 00:19.320
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:19.400 --> 00:20.960
-<i>Look at her face.</i>
-<i>Boing!</i>

00:21.040 --> 00:22.840
-<i>Oh, I want a dog.</i>
<i>-No.</i>

00:22.920 --> 00:24.400
<i>Yeah, let's get a dog.</i>

00:24.480 --> 00:26.840
<i>No, because they don't live that long,</i>
<i>do they?</i>

00:26.920 --> 00:28.800
<i>-Then it's really sad--</i>
<i>-What?</i>

00:28.880 --> 00:31.160
<i>Sorry, Brandy, but it's true that--</i>

00:31.240 --> 00:34.040
<i>you know, it's just incredibly upsetting</i>
<i>when dogs die.</i>

00:34.120 --> 00:38.640
<i>Yeah, I mean--</i>
<i>Which brings me to my next point, Dad.</i>

00:38.720 --> 00:40.720
<i>It's getting to that time when we need</i>

00:40.800 --> 00:43.000
<i>to start thinking</i>
<i>about your funeral, mate.</i>

00:43.080 --> 00:46.640
<i>Leave him alone! You've got 20 years, Ray.</i>

00:46.720 --> 00:49.400
<i>-I hope not.</i>
<i>-What sort of a question is that?</i>

00:49.480 --> 00:51.560
<i>Well, we need to know, don't we?</i>

00:51.640 --> 00:52.880
<i>Well, what about you?</i>

00:52.960 --> 00:54.520
<i>Don't care. You?</i>

00:55.440 --> 00:57.480
<i>I wanna be buried in the churchyard.</i>

00:57.560 --> 00:59.720
<i>And then people can bring flowers</i>
<i>every day and cry.</i>

00:59.800 --> 01:03.320
<i> For the first couple of days maybe.</i>
<i>Then it's, "Oh, fuck it, it's raining."</i>

01:03.400 --> 01:05.400
-<i>That's nice.</i>
<i>-Cremated.</i>

01:05.480 --> 01:09.200
<i>See? Yeah. Exactly.</i>
<i>No fuss. Not selfish.</i>

01:09.280 --> 01:13.680
<i>And I want you to scatter my ashes</i>
<i>in Midlake, where I met your mum.</i>

01:13.760 --> 01:17.440
<i>Yeah, I'm not going all the way</i>
<i>to Midlake just for that, I'll be honest.</i>

01:17.520 --> 01:20.960
<i>-It's only an hour or so drive.</i>
-<i>Yeah, I don't drive, do I?</i>

01:21.560 --> 01:24.280
<i>Well, it's my last request!</i>

01:24.360 --> 01:27.760
<i>So? Okay, I'll say yes now,</i>
<i>but then you won't know, will you?</i>

01:27.840 --> 01:31.080
<i>-I just won't bother when it comes to it.</i>
-<i>Where in Midlake, Ray?</i>

01:31.160 --> 01:32.640
<i>Uh, The Traveler's Friend.</i>

01:32.720 --> 01:35.840
<i>A lovely old pub.</i>
<i>I proposed there as well.</i>

01:35.920 --> 01:39.040
-<i>It's probably a phone shop now.</i>
<i>-What do you think about that?</i>

01:39.120 --> 01:41.840
<i>Your only son won't drive up the road</i>
<i>to scatter your ashes.</i>

01:41.920 --> 01:45.360
<i>-He'll do it. He's a good boy.</i>
<i>-Aw.</i>

02:01.800 --> 02:03.120
Oh, hi. You all right?

02:03.200 --> 02:04.640
What do you think?

02:05.280 --> 02:06.960
-No?
-Correct.

02:07.840 --> 02:10.720
It's getting too much. What can I do?

02:11.760 --> 02:15.720
I dunno. You knew what she did
for a living. You were all right with it.

02:15.800 --> 02:19.200
But I didn't think she'd still be doing it
when we became an item.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.320
Doesn't happen in the movies, does it?

02:21.920 --> 02:24.120
Richard Gere doesn't turn up
in a white limousine

02:24.200 --> 02:25.920
and climb up the fire escape

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
and Julia Roberts says,
"Oh, can you give us a sec?"

02:28.080 --> 02:30.400
"I'm just sucking off Bobby Chang,
the dry cleaner."

02:32.040 --> 02:34.400
-How do you know she sucked him off?
-Oh, he told me.

02:34.480 --> 02:38.320
He didn't know she was my missus.
I didn't say anything. I just felt sick.

02:39.000 --> 02:39.920
I was in shock.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.360
I just feel so depressed.

02:42.440 --> 02:46.240
-Well, maybe you should talk to her.
-I can't! I feel stupid.

02:46.320 --> 02:48.000
Why don't you talk to her?

02:48.080 --> 02:50.480
No, definitely not!
I haven't seen her for ages.

02:50.560 --> 02:52.840
She doesn't come around now.
I assumed she was busy.

02:52.920 --> 02:54.480
Oh yeah, she's busy all right.

02:55.160 --> 02:56.000
Sure.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.600
-Well, you should talk to someone.
-I am.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.160
-I'm not qualified--
-Yes, you are.

03:02.240 --> 03:05.200
You were depressed
and suicidal, weren't you?

03:05.280 --> 03:07.880
-You're not suicidal, are you?
-No, couldn't be arsed.

03:07.960 --> 03:10.800
-Good.
-Come on, help us out. It's your fault!

03:10.880 --> 03:11.920
Oh, right.

03:12.000 --> 03:12.920
Oh, please?

03:14.280 --> 03:16.560
Let me have a think. Fuck's sake!

03:19.000 --> 03:19.840
Go on.

03:34.360 --> 03:35.840
-Hi.
-Hi.

03:36.440 --> 03:37.320
Um,

03:37.840 --> 03:41.640
I've decided to go on a little trip
to scatter my dad's ashes.

03:41.720 --> 03:44.520
Oh, that's sweet. Where?

03:44.600 --> 03:47.600
Um, a little village
where he proposed to Mum.

03:48.280 --> 03:49.720
His last wish and all that.

03:50.240 --> 03:51.440
My ashes?

03:52.840 --> 03:54.920
No, not your ashes.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.200
You're not dead yet, are you?

03:58.120 --> 04:01.040
Also, you're not my dad, remember?

04:01.800 --> 04:03.520
Uh, am I adopted?

04:03.600 --> 04:05.680
Fuck me, it's like I've got a replacement.

04:05.760 --> 04:09.120
That would probably work out quite well
'cause his own son never sees him.

04:09.200 --> 04:12.440
Barely had time to stick him in here
before he emigrated to Australia.

04:12.520 --> 04:13.840
-Yeah?
-Okay?

04:14.400 --> 04:16.720
-Oh.
-Life's cruel.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.640
Drink it up, then. Yeah.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.680
Hey. Hey. Hmm.

04:21.760 --> 04:22.600
Okay?

04:28.000 --> 04:30.920
That was touch and go.
Like a goldfish on the carpet.

04:31.560 --> 04:33.480
-Where?
-No, there's no--

04:33.560 --> 04:34.400
There we go.

04:41.720 --> 04:42.960
How's your new place?

04:43.640 --> 04:46.280
Uh, well, I'm grateful to Ken.

04:46.360 --> 04:50.880
But, like, you know, he's not charging me,
and it is better than living at home, but

04:51.800 --> 04:54.080
he keeps coming round looking for me.

04:54.600 --> 04:58.080
Honestly, I hear him on the stairs
and I just freeze,

04:58.160 --> 05:00.200
and then he tries the door
and then I'm just--

05:00.720 --> 05:04.920
I've started staying quiet until
he goes away. I'm living like Anne Frank.

05:06.360 --> 05:07.480
You'll find somewhere better.

05:07.560 --> 05:08.560
Hmm.

05:09.080 --> 05:11.720
Hello, darling.
I'm Ratty. This is the Nonce.

05:11.800 --> 05:15.040
All right? We're here about a story.
We do a podcast.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.720
-Oy, oy. Here he is.
-Hey! Hey!

05:16.800 --> 05:19.520
Remember us, son?
You want to cover our story in your paper.

05:19.600 --> 05:22.800
We do a podcast with your ex-shrink,
you fucking psycho!

05:22.880 --> 05:24.280
You're psychiatrists?

05:24.360 --> 05:27.040
No, not us! No, we're in finance.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.360
But the thing we share is that we're men,

05:29.440 --> 05:31.960
and we're proud of it.

05:32.040 --> 05:36.360
And that's what the podcast is all about.
It's just encouraging men to be men.

05:36.440 --> 05:39.520
Although it is inclusive.
We do get some birds listening in.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.840
Mainly ones that are sick of all
this fucking new man bollocks.

05:42.920 --> 05:45.720
But we just want to help the world man up.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.800
Listen.
We talk about it all day. Why don't we--

05:47.880 --> 05:48.960
Get it out!

05:49.040 --> 05:52.400
We'll broadcast on Twitter
and show you how we do the work.

05:52.480 --> 05:53.480
This is exciting.

05:53.560 --> 05:55.760
Send out a notification
to the followers.

05:55.840 --> 05:58.720
-Get on the live and here we go.
-Tell them we're here.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.040
Hello, you fucking shits!

06:00.120 --> 06:01.200
You dickheads!

06:01.280 --> 06:03.920
We're here at <i>The Tambury Gazette</i>
doing an interview.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.280
Say hello, darling. Go on.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.200
I'd rather not.

06:06.280 --> 06:08.320
Oh, she's shy! But that's all right.

06:08.400 --> 06:11.160
We're just doing this as a test.
Main broadcast tonight.

06:11.240 --> 06:14.320
-Testing. Testing my testicles!
-Testing one, two, three.

06:14.400 --> 06:17.240
Testing my testicles all over.
Oh my God, they're so full!

06:17.320 --> 06:18.960
-They're so full of jizz.

06:19.040 --> 06:19.920
Ooh.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.120
Done a sex wee, all in your in-tray!

06:22.200 --> 06:24.360
Tested my testes all over your nan!

06:24.440 --> 06:27.520
I was all like, "Crack, crack, crack,"
right in her fucking mooey.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.280
She was like,
"Oh, thanks, darling. I needed that."

06:30.360 --> 06:31.480
"What you been eating?"

06:31.560 --> 06:33.280
Don't worry about that, Nana.

06:33.360 --> 06:36.000
Don't slip over
on all that hairy monkey slosh plop.

06:36.080 --> 06:39.760
-As for you, gammon_69--
-Okay, guys. Guys! Okay, that's enough.

06:39.840 --> 06:43.280
-Come on. This is an office.
-"Guys, this is an office!"

06:43.360 --> 06:45.400
Fucking hell, Prince Andrew's kicking off,
isn't he?

06:45.480 --> 06:48.000
You fucking rotter!
Get back in your fucking box!

06:48.080 --> 06:51.480
-I'm only fucking about.
-He's just taking the piss. Don't worry.

06:51.560 --> 06:54.120
Ratty and the Nonce Podcast. Namaste.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.840
Health and well-being section, yeah?

06:55.920 --> 06:59.360
Um, I'll get that written up.
Thanks for the scoop. Cheers, boys.

07:03.040 --> 07:06.840
I was that close
to getting a bit physical there.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.240
But violence isn't the answer, so,

07:12.480 --> 07:14.240
definitely not, no.

07:20.960 --> 07:25.160
-Getting the hang of how things work?
-Yeah, yeah, I think so. Getting there.

07:39.080 --> 07:41.640
Come through.
There's a bit more space in here.

07:43.920 --> 07:45.880
Ooh. Has one of you pumped?

07:46.400 --> 07:48.440
-No, that's the house.
-Oh.

07:48.520 --> 07:51.440
Brian smells the same.
You can sniff him. He smells the same.

07:53.120 --> 07:54.160
Oh, yeah.

07:55.120 --> 07:56.720
-That's your smell, innit?
-Yes.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.760
Yeah. Sort of like poo and wee and sweat.

08:00.520 --> 08:01.720
And fear and shame.

08:01.800 --> 08:03.160
Mainly shit.

08:03.720 --> 08:05.960
-Whatever works for you, mate.
-Cheers.

08:07.480 --> 08:08.360
Hmm.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.840
Do you mind if I clear
all this junk up, Brian?

08:13.640 --> 08:15.120
Yeah, go for it.

08:18.600 --> 08:19.960
Do you mind if I don't watch?

08:21.280 --> 08:22.120
Bit emotional.

08:25.560 --> 08:26.400
Right.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.480
-Let's get crackin'.
-Yeah.

08:38.600 --> 08:39.840
-Tired?
-A little bit.

08:41.560 --> 08:43.560
I won't take long. Um--

08:43.640 --> 08:44.480
So,

08:45.080 --> 08:49.080
when did you get banned
from the all-you-can-eat buffet?

08:49.640 --> 08:50.480
Last month.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.240
Still angry about it.

08:52.960 --> 08:57.760
-Sure. And what reason did they give?
-Oh, they were perfectly honest.

08:57.840 --> 08:59.920
They said I was putting them
out of business.

09:00.560 --> 09:01.920
They'd never seen anything like it.

09:02.600 --> 09:05.600
I mean, they'd given me a few warnings
for eating too much, but

09:06.120 --> 09:09.520
I said, "How can I eat too much
if it's all I can eat'?"

09:09.600 --> 09:10.960
Mm.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.920
Good point. And, uh, how often did you go?

09:14.000 --> 09:15.920
Every day. Lunch and dinner.

09:16.560 --> 09:17.960
You went twice a day?

09:18.640 --> 09:21.600
No, just once, from lunch until dinner.

09:22.440 --> 09:25.600
Then I was full.
And I could hardly walk home some days.

09:26.120 --> 09:31.680
And so you went every day
for, what, six hours?

09:31.760 --> 09:35.240
Yeah, six or seven hours.
I wasn't eating the whole time.

09:36.240 --> 09:39.360
I mean, I'd fall asleep now and again, but

09:40.280 --> 09:43.120
I'd wake up if someone came
to clear my plate away.

09:45.440 --> 09:48.640
Right, and how much did it cost?

09:48.720 --> 09:52.240
Ten pounds per person per visit.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.880
That's why I went once and stayed.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.240
You know,
I was really getting my money's worth.

09:57.320 --> 10:00.120
I mean, most people can manage
two or three slices of pizza

10:00.200 --> 10:02.080
and a couple of portions of pasta,

10:02.160 --> 10:04.880
but pizza's mostly bread
and pasta costs nothing,

10:04.960 --> 10:08.040
so that's how the restaurant
makes its profits.

10:08.760 --> 10:11.240
I would get 20 or 30 slices of pizza,

10:11.840 --> 10:13.600
scrape off the toppings.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.480
I'd leave the base.

10:15.560 --> 10:16.560
Decoy.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.920
Same with the spaghetti Bolognese.

10:19.440 --> 10:20.840
I'd make about 15 trips,

10:20.920 --> 10:23.760
and I'd pick all the meat
out of the spaghetti.

10:24.840 --> 10:28.960
Was left with about five pounds of beef.

10:30.120 --> 10:32.200
I had all the time in the world.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.800
-You don't work?
-No.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.360
Took early retirement
to get disability benefits.

10:38.440 --> 10:42.520
Oh, um, if you don't mind me asking,
um, what's wrong with you?

10:43.040 --> 10:44.120
Well, look at me.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.720
I'm absolutely fucked.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.840
Where exactly is this place?

10:50.920 --> 10:53.280
-Just take a picture.
-Yeah? Okay.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.560
-Smile.

10:57.640 --> 10:58.480
Great.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.360
That annoyed me.

11:01.440 --> 11:02.680
-Because he's greedy?
-No.

11:02.760 --> 11:05.280
-Well, yeah, he is greedy, obviously.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.400
But he's right.

11:06.480 --> 11:08.160
They're building their brand

11:08.240 --> 11:10.720
on the promise
that you can eat as much as you want.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.080
A babyccino afterwards?

11:12.160 --> 11:16.360
You can't suddenly renege on the deal
'cause someone eats too much or too often

11:16.440 --> 11:19.240
or you've got to change the rules.
For everyone though.

11:19.320 --> 11:20.720
-Be upfront.
-The quinoa?

11:20.800 --> 11:24.040
-You love your quinoa.
-There's no honor anymore.

11:24.120 --> 11:25.760
Have you done a big, farmyard poo?

11:25.840 --> 11:28.320
-Oh, for fuck's sake.
-You okay?

11:28.840 --> 11:31.560
-Yeah, why?
-You just said, "For fuck's sake," so--

11:31.640 --> 11:34.160
And you assumed summat had annoyed me?

11:34.240 --> 11:37.440
-Like someone making unnecessary noise?
-Oh shit.

11:37.520 --> 11:40.320
-He's a baby.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.240
Yeah, but he's not the one
making all the noise, is he? You are.

11:43.320 --> 11:46.640
To keep him amused. 'Cause if he
was crying, that would annoy people.

11:46.720 --> 11:50.200
No, 'cause he's a baby. You making
all the noise is the annoying bit.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.880
They're sounds.
They shouldn't concern you.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.920
You talk to your friend.
I talk to my child.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.960
But you can't hear
every word I'm saying, can you?

11:58.040 --> 12:00.400
So what? There's noise around.
That's life.

12:00.480 --> 12:01.800
Okay. Good point.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.200
Who's a noisy prick?

12:07.800 --> 12:10.720
-You are! You big annoying prick!
-Well, that's pathetic.

12:10.800 --> 12:13.840
-Sorry, I'm talking to a friend.
-Saying things others don't want to hear.

12:13.920 --> 12:16.080
So are you, but you don't care, so--

12:16.160 --> 12:19.720
Yeah! You're a big, loud cock.
Yes, you are!

12:20.240 --> 12:23.280
You're a hipster,
gnome-looking fucking twat!

12:23.360 --> 12:27.320
You big, annoying, loud cock in public!
You are.

12:27.400 --> 12:30.200
You're a cunt. You are.
You are. You're a cunt!

12:30.280 --> 12:31.360
I'm gonna…

12:33.960 --> 12:35.880
Big belly! You cunt!

12:35.960 --> 12:37.680
You big fucking cunt!

12:38.240 --> 12:42.320
You big fucking cunt!

12:44.760 --> 12:45.960
They're just sounds.

12:55.560 --> 12:59.000
I'll tell you what, I'll drive you
to the table tennis, and we'll go together

12:59.720 --> 13:00.920
-to Midlake.
-Okay.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.560
-It'll be fun.
-All right.

13:02.640 --> 13:06.000
We'll do sort of a road trip.
Get some snacks and CDs. It'll be great.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.200
-Yeah. Cheers.
-Okay, good.

13:09.560 --> 13:12.360
Well, that's the rest of my day sorted.

13:13.080 --> 13:14.640
I'm playing him at table tennis,

13:14.720 --> 13:17.960
and then he's driving me to Midlake
to scatter my dad's ashes.

13:18.480 --> 13:20.000
Sounds like quite an exciting day.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.640
Yeah.

13:22.720 --> 13:25.280
Fucking hell.
What a bunch of losers we are.

13:25.360 --> 13:27.560
-Speak for yourself.
-Well, I was.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.360
But also for anyone else
who's a loser like me.

13:30.880 --> 13:33.320
Matt thinks he's adventurous
'cause he owns a cagoule.

13:33.400 --> 13:37.000
Lenny gets excited if he finds
an uneaten biscuit in his pocket. Come on.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.560
You're right. I've absolutely
nothing interesting in my life.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.280
Well, that's not true.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.760
Got a pretend boyfriend. I hate my job.

13:48.840 --> 13:51.800
I'd rather do what you do,
but I've lost my nerve.

13:53.360 --> 13:56.880
Yeah, I can't date anymore.
All the best men are taken.

13:58.440 --> 14:00.640
You know, or gay or mental.

14:02.760 --> 14:05.400
I made a list for my perfect bloke.
How tragic is that?

14:05.480 --> 14:08.280
Oh, yeah, I've done that. What's on yours?

14:08.360 --> 14:11.200
Own car, house, own business, no kids.

14:11.280 --> 14:14.720
Smart, you know, proper bloke.
What was on yours?

14:14.800 --> 14:16.920
Must have a face and a cock.

14:23.080 --> 14:25.080
Kath. Fancy a coffee?

14:26.000 --> 14:26.840
Yeah.

14:31.640 --> 14:34.040
I can't be bothered anymore.

14:34.800 --> 14:36.200
I mean, what's the point, eh?

14:36.280 --> 14:38.000
Yeah, I know how you feel.

14:38.080 --> 14:38.920
Oh.

14:39.440 --> 14:40.400
Excuse me?

14:41.000 --> 14:43.120
-Kath.
-What?

14:43.800 --> 14:44.640
What?

14:45.840 --> 14:48.160
I thought you were gonna ask my name.

14:48.240 --> 14:50.600
-Why?
-Yeah, why?

14:51.640 --> 14:52.480
Don't know.

14:53.040 --> 14:56.120
-Uh, do you have any change?
-Oh, I don't have any money.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.400
I mean, I've got money.

14:57.480 --> 14:58.680
I've got a good job.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.280
I just left it at work.

15:01.960 --> 15:02.880
Right. Okay.

15:03.840 --> 15:05.000
You married?

15:06.080 --> 15:07.480
-Uh, no.
-Girlfriend?

15:08.320 --> 15:09.480
-No.
-Gay?

15:09.560 --> 15:11.360
-No.
-Name?

15:11.440 --> 15:12.720
-Charles.
-Charles.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.040
-You met Kath?
-Yeah.

15:14.120 --> 15:15.960
-Yep.
-Why would you think I'm gay?

15:16.040 --> 15:16.960
Why wouldn't I?

15:17.040 --> 15:19.560
-What?
-It doesn't matter. Either way.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.720
Would you like to go for a drink later?

15:24.520 --> 15:25.680
Yeah.

15:26.440 --> 15:30.480
Okay. Um, let me give you my card.

15:32.000 --> 15:32.840
Thank you.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.680
-Thanks.
-Bye.

15:35.760 --> 15:36.800
Bye.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.080
Oh, I could die.

15:41.800 --> 15:44.800
-Why?
-Of embarrassment! I was so uncool.

15:45.720 --> 15:47.400
-He liked you.
-No, he didn't!

15:47.480 --> 15:50.480
-He panicked and was polite.
-Lawyers don't panic.

15:50.560 --> 15:54.440
That's another thing. He's a lawyer!
He had the costume and everything.

15:54.520 --> 15:58.080
Oh. I can't tell him I work for a free
local paper. He'll think I'm a loser.

15:58.160 --> 15:59.120
None taken.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.720
Tell him you're
an investigative journalist.

16:04.200 --> 16:07.400
No, that'll frighten him.
He'll think I'm looking into him.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.000
What would a lawyer want me to be?

16:11.840 --> 16:12.960
A murderer.

16:13.760 --> 16:14.800
-What?

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Just be yourself.

16:17.720 --> 16:18.640
Tell the truth.

16:20.440 --> 16:21.760
Always tell the truth.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.080
This is even worse.

16:29.080 --> 16:29.920
What is?

16:30.640 --> 16:33.480
You sat there doing a fucking word search!

16:33.560 --> 16:36.720
Used to be porn, mate, stacked that high.

16:37.760 --> 16:38.960
Those days are gone.

16:40.760 --> 16:44.200
Five years ago, I could've knocked one out
and got you right in the face.

16:47.720 --> 16:49.080
I've wasted my life.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.240
-Ready?
-Yeah.

16:51.320 --> 16:52.800
All right. Let's go.

16:54.880 --> 16:55.880
Oh.

16:55.960 --> 16:57.040
One, nil.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.640
Come on.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.360
Okay. All right, three, nil.

17:05.120 --> 17:08.120
-Oh, did that get a little nick on--
-No.

17:09.800 --> 17:11.680
-Ow. Ooh.
-Right in the bollocks!

17:12.480 --> 17:13.640
Okay.

17:15.720 --> 17:16.760
Oh.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.640
-Nineteen, two?
-Three!

17:19.720 --> 17:20.840
-Is it? Okay.
-Yeah.

17:24.160 --> 17:25.560
-Twenty, three.
-Yeah. Fine.

17:28.840 --> 17:29.760
Ugh.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.400
Good game.

17:32.640 --> 17:35.680
I mean, it wasn't athletic enough, really,
was it? Just--

17:36.320 --> 17:39.160
-You were just standing there.
-Yeah, hitting it back.

17:39.240 --> 17:40.200
Yeah, but you're not.

17:40.280 --> 17:41.880
-You're barely moving.
-Right.

17:41.960 --> 17:44.480
So I think we need to do something
a bit more sporty.

17:44.560 --> 17:47.600
-Okay.
-Um, like tennis or something.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.440
-Yeah, great.
-Good. Okay.

17:49.520 --> 17:53.440
'Cause table tennis is just luck,
isn't it? It's like pinball.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.800
-Nah, that's enough of that.
-Put something you like on, then.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.560
Yeah. There's the challenge.

18:03.520 --> 18:05.040
Will Smith, <i>Willennium.</i>

18:05.560 --> 18:09.160
-Yes, as in the Millennium.
Yeah, the last time anyone bought a CD.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.320
-Lighthouse Family.
-Good band.

18:13.360 --> 18:14.600
Love the Lighthouse Family.

18:14.680 --> 18:16.760
-Susan fucking Boyle?
-Yeah?

18:17.360 --> 18:18.200
What?

18:18.800 --> 18:21.200
-Out she goes.
-Hey! What are you doing?

18:22.000 --> 18:23.640
Did you-- Not Bublé.

18:23.720 --> 18:24.640
Yes, Bublé.

18:24.720 --> 18:27.440
No! Are you mad?
You'll kill someone! Tony!

18:27.520 --> 18:29.120
-Radiohead.
-That's not mine.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.680
No, I know. It's good.

18:31.680 --> 18:32.600
It's Jill's.

18:33.360 --> 18:35.160
-Lisa got it for her.
-Did she?

18:36.560 --> 18:37.760
Yeah, she loved 'em.

19:14.360 --> 19:15.640
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.440
Um, so you're a lawyer?

19:22.320 --> 19:23.920
Uh, yes, a barrister.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.040
-Right.
-You?

19:25.120 --> 19:26.000
No.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.280
-What?
-No, I'm-- I'm not a barrister.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.760
Okay. Uh, what is your job?

19:35.520 --> 19:37.400
Oh, my job?

19:37.480 --> 19:38.520
Hmm.

19:38.600 --> 19:39.520
Um,

19:40.440 --> 19:42.760
okay, I-- I'm not gonna lie.

19:43.480 --> 19:44.320
I'm

19:45.040 --> 19:46.280
a doctor.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.080
-Wow.
-Yeah.

19:49.080 --> 19:51.880
-You got a practice?
-No need! Done all that!

19:51.960 --> 19:53.280
Got my certificate and everything.

19:54.080 --> 19:54.920
What?

19:56.200 --> 19:57.200
What did you say?

19:57.280 --> 20:03.200
Oh, um, do you have a practice?
Are you a GP or a surgeon in a hospital?

20:03.280 --> 20:04.600
Oh, yeah.

20:04.680 --> 20:07.000
Um, I work in a hospital

20:07.640 --> 20:08.680
as a doctor.

20:11.800 --> 20:12.640
Right.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.200
-Should we order?
-Yeah.

20:24.240 --> 20:25.120
Huh.

20:28.280 --> 20:29.640
I have lived a life, boy.

20:29.720 --> 20:30.720
-Yeah?
-Yes.

20:31.600 --> 20:32.840
Yeah, roller-coaster.

20:33.640 --> 20:36.000
She was one hell of a woman, sexually.

20:39.240 --> 20:41.600
A wild creature that could not be tamed.

20:43.240 --> 20:44.080
Great sex.

20:45.720 --> 20:46.760
Great sex.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.240
I made a porno of her.

20:55.360 --> 20:56.920
Right on this very carpet.

20:58.440 --> 21:00.840
She said she wanted a threesome
with me and Roly Carter.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.640
Absolute monster of a man.
Do you know him?

21:05.720 --> 21:07.080
-No.
-Six foot three.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.400
280 lb. with his jewelry on.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.080
I agreed.

21:13.960 --> 21:16.040
Turns out she just wanted me
to hold the camcorder.

21:19.880 --> 21:20.720
Not a problem.

21:22.680 --> 21:24.440
"Whatever you want, my darling."

21:25.960 --> 21:28.400
So she's on all fours
and he's round the back door,

21:29.120 --> 21:30.480
doing her doggy style.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.840
I'm capturing the whole damn thing.

21:37.600 --> 21:41.400
She was absolutely fucking loving it.
I could see it in her eyes.

21:45.280 --> 21:46.640
And then Roly looks at me,

21:47.800 --> 21:51.560
out of the blue, straight down the lens,
and shakes his head,

21:53.720 --> 21:54.600
as if to say,

21:56.000 --> 21:58.800
"This is absolutely fucking awful."

22:00.040 --> 22:02.200
I didn't know
if he meant the quality of the production

22:02.280 --> 22:05.640
or the rough carpet on his knees. Turns
out he meant the smell of her growler.

22:10.040 --> 22:11.120
-Here we go.
-Thank you.

22:11.640 --> 22:12.480
Thanks.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.240
Lovely.

22:15.040 --> 22:18.080
Do you, uh-- Do you get
a chance to cook much? In your--

22:18.160 --> 22:21.520
Oh, no. No, I'm rushed off my feet.

22:21.600 --> 22:22.960
-Yeah.

22:23.040 --> 22:24.160
-Most days.
-Yeah.

22:24.240 --> 22:25.080
Yeah.

22:25.160 --> 22:30.040
I just have to get
frozen meals for one in.

22:30.120 --> 22:31.960
-Oh, that's so sad.
-Yeah.

22:38.600 --> 22:40.880
-Um, she's a doctor!
-Off duty!

22:40.960 --> 22:42.920
-What?
-I'm off duty.

22:47.640 --> 22:48.920
Okay.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.520
-That's it.
-She's fine. Thought so.

22:54.840 --> 22:56.080
Why didn't you help her?

23:32.800 --> 23:34.120
This place is amazing.

23:34.960 --> 23:37.680
Built in the 14th century or something?

23:37.760 --> 23:38.920
-I dunno.
-Oh.

23:40.040 --> 23:43.560
This must be the table he proposed at.
It was under the portrait of the Queen.

23:43.640 --> 23:45.640
-Really?
-Yeah, let's sit here.

23:46.480 --> 23:47.400
That's great.

23:48.080 --> 23:49.040
Wow.

23:50.240 --> 23:52.640
Think of all the people
that have been here.

23:53.480 --> 23:55.480
-Here's a good place.
-Okay.

23:55.560 --> 23:56.560
Um…

23:59.840 --> 24:00.800
What are you doing?

24:01.480 --> 24:03.880
I'm just sprinkling
a few of my dad's ashes.

24:03.960 --> 24:05.120
On the carpet?

24:06.080 --> 24:07.520
Yeah, it was his last request.

24:07.600 --> 24:10.160
Oh, was it? It's not him
who's gonna have to clear it up, is it?

24:10.240 --> 24:12.880
Mate, it's a silly little ritual. Okay?

24:12.960 --> 24:15.720
There's no harm.
I know they get cleared away. So--

24:15.800 --> 24:17.880
-It's vandalism.
-It's not vandalism, is it?

24:18.400 --> 24:20.680
-There's no damage.
-Littering, then.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.600
It's my dad's ashes, okay?

24:23.680 --> 24:27.640
He used to come here all the time.
It's my way of paying my respects.

24:27.720 --> 24:30.160
Well, sprinkle 'em in the bin.
What difference does it make?

24:30.240 --> 24:33.160
I'm sure he didn't specify
sprinkling them on the bloody carpet.

24:33.240 --> 24:36.080
No, but this is the table
he proposed to my mother at, okay?

24:36.160 --> 24:37.800
I recognize it from his description.

24:37.880 --> 24:39.520
It's dust, for Christ's sake!

24:39.600 --> 24:40.480
It's disgusting.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.600
-What about diseases?
-What diseases?

24:42.680 --> 24:45.280
-From dead bodies!
-It's not a dead body, is it?

24:45.360 --> 24:47.840
If I dragged him in from the morgue
and dumped him on the carpet,

24:47.920 --> 24:49.560
maybe you'd have every right
to be annoyed.

24:49.640 --> 24:52.640
Well, I <i>do </i>have every right.
I can do what I want. It's my pub.

24:52.720 --> 24:56.080
I can bar you, and I don't have to give
a reason. The two of you, out!

24:56.160 --> 24:57.360
Take your rubbish with you.

24:58.920 --> 24:59.760
Rubbish?

25:04.600 --> 25:07.120
Ugh. You stupid bastard!

25:07.640 --> 25:08.880
A bit went in my mouth!

25:08.960 --> 25:11.560
Good. I hope that was his cock,
you stupid cunt.

25:11.640 --> 25:12.720
Ugh.

25:13.840 --> 25:14.840
Ugh.

25:44.840 --> 25:46.160
"I hope that was his cock,

25:47.280 --> 25:48.480
you stupid cunt."

25:56.800 --> 25:58.800
-Oh.
