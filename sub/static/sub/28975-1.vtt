thirteen times

00:43.391 --> 00:44.479
when I was a little girl.

Thirteen?

You even wrote it down.

Give me a minute.

02:51.519 --> 02:55.871
You know, ah, when
we were young,

02:56.045 --> 03:00.180
I thought I was going to be a
big famous country star.

03:01.746 --> 03:03.792
Then you came along.

03:04.401 --> 03:08.013
So I thought that I'd try
my hand at football.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.538
Then Bart here, he came along.

03:11.365 --> 03:14.194
So I realized that I was
never going to be a star.

03:15.543 --> 03:17.327
So I decided to give up.

Is this where you hit us?

[chuckles]

03:22.898 --> 03:24.508
It was you.

03:24.682 --> 03:26.684
You showed me it wasn't
about being better.

03:26.858 --> 03:30.862
It was not about us
competing against each other.

03:32.124 --> 03:33.822
It was us against the world.

03:33.996 --> 03:36.477
Being brothers.

Seriously?

04:12.643 --> 04:13.905
That was my guitar!

04:14.079 --> 04:16.255
I learned how to
play on this guitar.

04:16.952 --> 04:18.345
It's symbolism.

Billy! I am so
glad you answered.

04:37.973 --> 04:40.889
Nice of you to finally
stop avoiding my calls.

04:41.063 --> 04:42.934
I'm not avoiding your calls.

04:43.108 --> 04:44.458
Oh, sure you were.

04:44.632 --> 04:46.068
I have been calling
you for weeks,

04:46.242 --> 04:48.244
leaving long detailed messages.

04:48.418 --> 04:50.028
Did you not get them?

04:50.202 --> 04:51.552
They were very important.

04:51.726 --> 04:53.815
Mary, just get to the point.

04:53.989 --> 04:57.122
You must look nice.
All dressed up.

05:05.783 --> 05:07.872
How do you know I'm dressed up?

05:08.046 --> 05:09.700
Because I'm smarter
than you, Billy.

05:09.874 --> 05:11.354
So what did Zane go with?

05:11.528 --> 05:13.748
Just a bow tie or a tight
T-shirt for the big day?

05:13.922 --> 05:16.838
Mary, don't ruin this
it for him. Or them.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.492
What?

05:18.666 --> 05:21.277
Ruin Zane and
Jeannette's wedding day?

05:21.451 --> 05:23.061
The way you two
ruined my career?

05:23.235 --> 05:24.889
Whoa.

05:25.063 --> 05:26.543
I am not even thinking
about you and Zane actually.

05:26.717 --> 05:28.632
I'm just thinking
about business.

05:28.980 --> 05:30.721
We didn't ruin your career.

05:30.895 --> 05:33.158
We just gave you time to
focus on other artists.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.858
Well, they voted me off
the board because of you,

05:37.032 --> 05:40.383
so I figured, why not use
you two to get me back in.

05:41.819 --> 05:44.648
Zane fulfilled his contract.
We're out.

05:44.822 --> 05:46.389
We can't help you anymore.

05:46.563 --> 05:48.739
Oh, my sweet Billy.

05:48.913 --> 05:50.611
I think ahead.

05:50.785 --> 05:53.396
I am so kind that I left
the board of directors

05:53.570 --> 05:55.920
a very valuable parting
gift when I left.

05:56.094 --> 05:59.184
So valuable in fact,
that when they open it,

05:59.359 --> 06:01.926
they're going to have no
choice but to let me back in.

06:03.101 --> 06:05.103
What did you do?

06:05.277 --> 06:07.845
I would read the fine print on
Zane's old amended contract,

06:08.019 --> 06:08.846
if I was you.

06:09.020 --> 06:10.544
You changed it.

06:11.893 --> 06:13.808
Now who's the smart one.

06:13.982 --> 06:16.114
Okay, you're going to
want to get your brother

06:16.288 --> 06:19.204
out of his fancy clothes and
on to some transportation.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.989
And you'd better hurry.

06:21.163 --> 06:23.557

in just a few hours.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.123
I'm emailing you the
details right now.

06:25.297 --> 06:26.560

seeing you Billy.

06:36.308 --> 06:37.875
Okey dokey.

06:38.049 --> 06:41.183
So everybody is almost
here, even Uncle Earl,

06:41.357 --> 06:42.924
who I am going to
take credit for because

06:43.098 --> 06:44.969
I told him the wedding is
taking place in two hours.

06:49.234 --> 06:51.411
Mom, what's wrong?

06:56.198 --> 06:57.199
Nothing, it's just...

06:57.373 --> 07:01.029
You look so beautiful.

07:01.203 --> 07:02.726
Do I normally look that bad?

07:02.900 --> 07:04.424
No, no.

07:07.862 --> 07:11.213
I think that I have been
so focused on making sure

07:11.387 --> 07:13.520
this day goes perfectly, that
it's just hitting me now

07:13.694 --> 07:15.260
that my baby is getting married.

07:15.957 --> 07:17.437

07:21.353 --> 07:23.834
Okay, we are not getting absurd.

07:24.008 --> 07:26.054
This is not happening.
I'm not going to cry.

07:29.057 --> 07:30.450
Hey!

07:30.624 --> 07:32.713
Jeannette, sorry, sorry.

07:32.887 --> 07:34.410
Hey Jeannette. We need to talk.

07:34.584 --> 07:36.107
I'm sorry.

07:36.281 --> 07:37.848
It is bad luck to see the
bride before the wedding!

07:38.022 --> 07:40.155
I'm afraid I already
brought the bad luck.

07:40.329 --> 07:41.896
What is it?

07:42.549 --> 07:43.811
It looks like Mary
left me a trap

07:43.985 --> 07:46.117
after I left her
label for Billy's.

07:46.291 --> 07:48.424
What kind of trap?

07:48.598 --> 07:49.904
Wait a second. Who's Mary?

07:50.078 --> 07:51.906
She's the head of
Zane's old record label.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.082
Or she was.

07:54.256 --> 07:55.562
After Zane and I left
to start our own,

07:55.736 --> 07:56.606
they voted her out.

07:56.780 --> 07:58.826
So what's the problem?

07:59.000 --> 08:00.871
She purposely booked
me on three more shows

08:01.045 --> 08:03.178
as soon as she found out
Billy was stealing me away.

08:03.352 --> 08:04.962
Okay.

08:05.136 --> 08:06.616
So, you play the shows,
finish out the contract

08:06.790 --> 08:07.661
and then you're done with
her for good, right?

08:10.577 --> 08:12.492
She intentionally booked
them over our wedding.

08:15.364 --> 08:16.844
You've got to be kidding me.

08:17.018 --> 08:18.976
How did nobody know
about this before?

08:19.150 --> 08:20.848
She arranged them in secret and
just announced them last night.

08:21.022 --> 08:23.720
Zane's first show is in Ohio...

08:23.894 --> 08:26.114
tonight.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.333
Honestly, if I didn't
hate her so much

08:28.508 --> 08:29.857
I'd admire her horribleness.

08:30.031 --> 08:31.946
Okay, no. Stop. This is silly.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.774
Just explain to her that
you are getting married,

08:33.948 --> 08:36.124
and then you'll do the
shows at another time.

08:36.298 --> 08:37.212
I wish it were that easy.

08:37.385 --> 08:38.822
It is that easy!

08:38.996 --> 08:40.476
Sweetheart, this
is your wedding.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.696
No, they don't care about that.

08:42.870 --> 08:44.480
Zane will be in
breach of contract.

08:44.654 --> 08:46.438
He could get sued.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.658
Not to mention halting any
future shows you want to play.

08:48.832 --> 08:50.530
Yeah.

08:50.704 --> 08:52.140

full well it would cripple

08:52.314 --> 08:53.881

08:54.055 --> 08:55.404
You know what, I'll figure
something else out.

08:55.578 --> 08:57.145
I'll start again.

08:57.319 --> 08:58.538
I'm not going to ruin your day.

forty minutes late so the

holding Zane Gunther's option.

20:18.086 --> 20:20.567
Now he's going to finish
these three shows for you

20:20.741 --> 20:22.133
and you're going
to cut him loose.

20:22.308 --> 20:24.484
Non-negotiable. Understand?

help, I wish him well.

back to being rich

place to yourself

you'll let Zane go?

21:30.680 --> 21:32.639
Then you're on your own. Got it?

How can I say no to a
great deal like that?

21:39.210 --> 21:40.777
One week!

I've never seen you lose
a negotiation like that.

21:46.870 --> 21:49.220
Yeah, that's probably
why she got so much

Let's make this next shot
triple or nothing. Huh?

21:56.053 --> 21:57.620

this is going to be

01:04:29.996 --> 01:04:31.868
Call me crazy, but I think
this guy has a crush on you.

01:04:35.523 --> 01:04:37.961
Yeah, he keeps inviting
me to go bowling.

01:04:38.135 --> 01:04:39.571
I have no idea why.

01:04:39.745 --> 01:04:41.094
[whispers] I do not
understand these people.

01:04:42.139 --> 01:04:43.531
Did you have fun?

01:04:43.705 --> 01:04:44.793
Yeah, I did.

01:04:44.968 --> 01:04:46.665
But I am so glad it's over.

01:04:46.839 --> 01:04:48.362
I just want to get
home to you and Quinn.

01:04:48.536 --> 01:04:49.668
[lots of indistinct
conversations]

01:04:50.364 --> 01:04:51.844
Sounds like quite the
celebration over there.

01:04:52.018 --> 01:04:53.715
What was that?

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:55.892
[shouts] I said it sounds
like you're having fun!

01:04:56.066 --> 01:04:57.676
They're all very nice. Yes.

01:04:57.850 --> 01:04:59.286
I'll see you tomorrow?

01:04:59.852 --> 01:05:01.854
Billy booked me for a
signing at the mall.

01:05:02.028 --> 01:05:03.682
I think I'll be home late.

01:05:05.727 --> 01:05:06.685
Are you there?

01:05:06.859 --> 01:05:07.773
Hey, can you hear me?

01:05:07.947 --> 01:05:09.166
Yeah. I heard you.

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.907
Jeannette? Can you hear me?

01:05:11.081 --> 01:05:12.343
[shouts] I said I heard you!

01:05:13.997 --> 01:05:15.912
I'm trying to be
quiet, Quinn's asleep.

01:05:16.086 --> 01:05:18.088
Okay, all right. Love you too!

01:05:18.262 --> 01:05:19.916
I gotta go! Okay. Bye.

01:05:20.090 --> 01:05:21.134
Love you too!

01:05:21.743 --> 01:05:24.746
Zane? Hello?

01:05:25.051 --> 01:05:26.009
People want to meet you.

01:05:26.183 --> 01:05:27.271
Okay. Let's do it.

01:05:36.497 --> 01:05:37.890
A little late isn't
it, young lady?

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:41.938
Sammy! Ah!

01:05:43.243 --> 01:05:46.116
How long have you been sitting
in the dark like a maniac?

01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:47.073
You scared me to death.

01:05:47.247 --> 01:05:48.466
Bad night?

01:05:50.468 --> 01:05:56.909
Yeah... No...
Maybe? I don't know.

01:05:57.083 --> 01:05:59.259
Let me guess.

01:05:59.433 --> 01:06:01.435
You met up with Dad
and that stirred up

01:06:01.609 --> 01:06:03.263
a bunch of old feelings
you didn't know you had

01:06:03.437 --> 01:06:05.309
and now you don't
know how to feel?

01:06:05.483 --> 01:06:08.051
[scoffs] No.

01:06:11.837 --> 01:06:13.404
How'd you know?

01:06:13.578 --> 01:06:14.971
Because I'm psychic.

01:06:15.145 --> 01:06:17.321
We've spoken about
my gift many times.

01:06:17.495 --> 01:06:19.888
And, dad called a half hour ago.

01:06:20.063 --> 01:06:20.977
[they both chuckle]

01:06:22.935 --> 01:06:26.243
Ugh, what do I do?

01:06:26.417 --> 01:06:28.854
Well, I get us a bottle of wine,

01:06:29.028 --> 01:06:31.117
and then we spend the night like

01:06:31.291 --> 01:06:35.034
cliche mother/daughter duos
that we both can't stand.

01:06:35.208 --> 01:06:36.166
[chuckles] I'm in.

01:06:37.384 --> 01:06:38.733
I'll get the glasses.

01:06:38.907 --> 01:06:39.952
I'll get the wine.

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:59.363
[texts a message]

01:07:04.803 --> 01:07:06.283
[camera clicks]

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.633
[Zane] All right! Whoa!

01:07:10.113 --> 01:07:12.941
Let's see. Ah, look at my
dumb face. What do you think?

01:07:13.116 --> 01:07:14.465
[laughing]

01:07:14.639 --> 01:07:14.813
[Fan] Zane! Zane!

01:07:22.864 --> 01:07:24.214
Sorry, it's not really
my element, but, ah...

01:07:26.955 --> 01:07:28.392
Look who I found!

01:07:29.784 --> 01:07:32.831
Meagan? Again?

01:07:33.005 --> 01:07:35.529
I heard you were here. I
couldn't pass up a good party!

01:07:35.703 --> 01:07:37.488
Of course not.

01:07:37.662 --> 01:07:38.924
Hey, could you
get a photo of us?

01:07:39.098 --> 01:07:40.534
Yeah. Sure.

01:07:41.927 --> 01:07:43.015
Sure.

01:07:46.714 --> 01:07:48.412
-Got it.
-One more.

01:07:51.502 --> 01:07:53.504
Okay. I really do have to go.

01:07:53.678 --> 01:07:54.983
It was great to see you again.

01:07:55.158 --> 01:07:56.115
-Thank you. You rock.
-See you, buddy.

01:08:00.163 --> 01:08:03.688
Hey, ah, I hate
to say this, but,

01:08:03.862 --> 01:08:06.169
I think he's in love
with someone else.

01:08:06.343 --> 01:08:07.692
You want to meet the cast?

01:08:07.866 --> 01:08:09.824
Yeah, sure.

01:08:16.483 --> 01:08:18.050
Oh! Hey Jolene!

01:08:18.224 --> 01:08:19.138
Hey!

01:08:19.312 --> 01:08:20.573
When did you get back?

01:08:20.747 --> 01:08:22.707
Late last night.
What are you up to?

01:08:22.881 --> 01:08:24.535
Oh. Just heading to the bakery.

01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:26.798
Of course. The wedding.

01:08:26.971 --> 01:08:28.582
So what kind did you go with?

01:08:28.756 --> 01:08:30.410
And did they give
you a discount?

01:08:30.584 --> 01:08:32.238
Because I can talk to them.

01:08:32.412 --> 01:08:34.849
I'm actually just going to
put a hold on the cake.

01:08:35.023 --> 01:08:36.982
Oh.

01:08:37.156 --> 01:08:41.943
It's nothing bad, it's just
with the incredible fortune

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:47.993
that Zane's had with his music
lately, and me opening the

01:08:48.167 --> 01:08:49.863
store, we decided to pump
the brakes a little.

01:08:50.648 --> 01:08:53.477
Well, I guess that makes sense.

01:08:53.651 --> 01:08:56.697
Although I know this is
making Zane miserable.

01:08:57.089 --> 01:08:58.308
Are you all right?

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:05.010
Aw... come here. I got you.

01:09:05.184 --> 01:09:06.316
[Jeannette sobs]

01:09:09.970 --> 01:09:13.410
I've barely talked to
him, and I see him on TV

01:09:13.584 --> 01:09:16.152
surrounded by all
these beautiful women.

01:09:16.326 --> 01:09:19.894
As long as I've known Zane,
he's a good and honorable man.

01:09:20.068 --> 01:09:21.983
Now you know that.

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:25.161
For sure I do.

01:09:25.335 --> 01:09:28.511
But what if he loves
the attention more

01:09:28.685 --> 01:09:31.254
than he loves me, you know.

01:09:31.428 --> 01:09:33.908
Maybe I'm holding him back.

01:09:34.082 --> 01:09:35.519
You listen to me.

01:09:35.693 --> 01:09:37.564
Zane loves you and he
wants to marry you

01:09:37.738 --> 01:09:39.479
as soon as this wedding
can be arranged.

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:42.874
You know what?

01:09:43.048 --> 01:09:44.658
You need cheesecake.

01:09:44.832 --> 01:09:45.658
[they both laugh]

01:09:45.832 --> 01:09:47.183
Let's go get some.

01:09:51.622 --> 01:09:53.885
Mary, this is lower than low.

01:09:54.059 --> 01:09:56.322
[chuckles] Is that any way
to greet an old friend?

01:09:56.888 --> 01:09:59.717
Well, I was actually being nice.

01:09:59.891 --> 01:10:01.980
Considering you put us through.

01:10:02.154 --> 01:10:03.721
If it wasn't for Jolene...

01:10:03.895 --> 01:10:05.766
How is Jolene?
I've always liked her.

01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:08.595
Beautiful voice.
Very professional.

01:10:08.769 --> 01:10:10.336
Unlike some people.

01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:12.251
Jolene is fabulous.

01:10:12.425 --> 01:10:14.427
Actually she works miracles
because she found a way to

01:10:14.601 --> 01:10:16.081
get Zane out of that
crappy little option you

01:10:16.255 --> 01:10:17.865
rigged in his contract.

01:10:18.039 --> 01:10:20.085
Did she?

01:10:20.259 --> 01:10:22.087
Yeah, she actually likes people.

01:10:22.261 --> 01:10:25.177
Oh, that is so sweet.
I think I'm going to cry.

01:10:25.351 --> 01:10:28.354
Mary, you need to stop
messing with people's lives.

01:10:28.528 --> 01:10:30.443
Do you even know how many
young artists have come to me

01:10:30.617 --> 01:10:32.271
because they're tired
of big labels using

01:10:32.445 --> 01:10:34.055
and exploiting them?

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:35.274
I thought you had the
stomach for this industry.

01:10:35.448 --> 01:10:37.189
Apparently I was wrong.

01:10:37.363 --> 01:10:38.712
Yeah, well being tough can
only take you so far, Mary.

01:10:38.886 --> 01:10:41.585
You are so naive.

01:10:41.759 --> 01:10:43.500
You know, when I find a
young artist, I like to let

01:10:43.674 --> 01:10:44.979
them know that
they're taken care of.

01:10:45.153 --> 01:10:46.764
But you show them no respect.

01:10:46.938 --> 01:10:48.374
You don't even give
them the ability

01:10:48.548 --> 01:10:50.071
to develop their talents.

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:51.943
Develop their talents!
Do you hear yourself?

01:10:52.117 --> 01:10:54.075
That is a bunch of
artsy-fartsy, touchy-feely

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.599
nonsense!

01:10:55.773 --> 01:10:57.601
But that's not
how it used to be.

01:10:57.775 --> 01:10:59.385
When I first started working
with you, you wanted it to be

01:10:59.559 --> 01:11:02.040
nurturing the talent,
show the singer how to find

01:11:02.214 --> 01:11:03.563
their voice, help the
musician find their muse.

01:11:03.737 --> 01:11:05.739
-That was another time.
-So what now?

01:11:05.913 --> 01:11:08.220
You want to break them?
Just use them?

01:11:08.394 --> 01:11:09.569
You want to force a young
couple to walk away

01:11:09.743 --> 01:11:11.267
from their wedding day?

01:11:11.441 --> 01:11:12.833
I am good at what I do
because I make money.

01:11:13.007 --> 01:11:16.228
No. You used to be
good at making music.

01:11:29.197 --> 01:11:31.765
It was always easier
with you at my side.

01:11:31.939 --> 01:11:34.638
You're back on the Board again.

01:11:34.812 --> 01:11:37.249
They called me this morning.

01:11:39.164 --> 01:11:41.122
What are you going to do?

01:11:43.386 --> 01:11:46.040
I am going to nurture
talented young artists

01:11:46.214 --> 01:11:50.175
into the biggest stars
this world has ever seen.

01:11:50.871 --> 01:11:52.873
I look forward to working
with you in the future.

01:11:53.047 --> 01:11:54.658
On one condition.

01:11:55.354 --> 01:11:57.661
What's that?

01:11:57.835 --> 01:12:00.272
You let me take
you for tiramisu.

01:12:08.628 --> 01:12:11.283
[both laughing]
No more autographs!

01:12:11.457 --> 01:12:13.372
That has to be twice as many
as the last time right?

01:12:13.546 --> 01:12:15.287
Whew! At least.

01:12:15.461 --> 01:12:16.506
[laughing]

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:19.639
[fans yelling, screaming]

01:12:19.813 --> 01:12:20.466
[fans yelling, screaming]

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.729
What?

01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:26.037
I'm torn.

01:12:26.211 --> 01:12:28.300
As your brother, I'm telling
you you need to go home.

01:12:28.474 --> 01:12:29.954
See your family.

01:12:30.128 --> 01:12:31.738
And how are you torn?

01:12:31.912 --> 01:12:33.349
Because I know Billy's only
giving you half the work

01:12:33.523 --> 01:12:34.959
that's coming in.

01:12:35.133 --> 01:12:36.526
This is your moment.
Your star is rising.

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:39.006
Even bigger than before.

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:41.139
And you can't always see that as

01:12:41.313 --> 01:12:44.360
your professional star rises,
you neglect your personal life.

01:12:45.273 --> 01:12:47.580
Jeannette. Quinn.

01:12:47.754 --> 01:12:50.061
Billy and I have seen other
artists go through this.

01:12:50.235 --> 01:12:51.889
It tears people apart.

01:12:52.063 --> 01:12:53.934
[scoffs] Well, Jeannette
and I don't plan

01:12:54.108 --> 01:12:55.936
to be like those
other people, so...

01:12:56.110 --> 01:12:58.548
Nobody plans on ending
up like other people.

01:12:58.722 --> 01:13:01.377
Well, what do you want me to do?

01:13:01.551 --> 01:13:04.205
Like you said, my
star is rising. Right?

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:07.687
Got to make hay while
the sun is shining.

01:13:07.861 --> 01:13:11.561
But things have
been so good lately

01:13:11.735 --> 01:13:14.651
at home with
Jeannette and Quinn.

01:13:14.825 --> 01:13:16.914
I know. Believe me, I know you.

01:13:17.088 --> 01:13:21.875
I love you.

01:13:22.049 --> 01:13:24.791
You've got a serious
offer on the table.

01:13:24.965 --> 01:13:25.879
How serious?

01:13:29.143 --> 01:13:31.494
Life changing.

01:13:31.668 --> 01:13:34.888
Billy says he's going to talk to
you about it on Monday.

01:13:35.062 --> 01:13:35.541
I can't wait until Monday!
What a tease!

01:13:36.629 --> 01:13:37.674
I can't wait until Monday!
What a tease!

01:13:37.848 --> 01:13:38.805
What's the offer?

01:13:38.979 --> 01:13:39.937
[Bart's phone buzzes]

01:13:46.683 --> 01:13:48.554
What?

01:13:48.728 --> 01:13:50.338
The tabloids are breaking a
story about you and Meagan.

01:13:50.513 --> 01:13:51.470
That you're together.

01:13:51.644 --> 01:13:52.819
What?

01:13:55.648 --> 01:13:57.215
Oh, you are looking cozy.

01:13:57.389 --> 01:13:59.435
Eew! Now that's a bit much.
