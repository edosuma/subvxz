Dr. Brennan, Agent Booth,
he’s coming around.

00:51.802 --> 00:54.544
Hey, Michelangelo, you hear me?
You shouldn’t
call him that, Booth.

00:54.639 --> 00:56.755
If he had a head injury,
he might think that’s
who he is.

00:56.849 --> 00:59.306
Something’s poking
in my back.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.009

smells terrible.

— Do you know your name?
- Yes.

- Okay, what is it?
— I’m not saying.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.644
— Told you. You confused him.
- No, I didn’t.

01:07.735 --> 01:10.067
I’m not confused.
I’m just not telling you my name.

01:10.154 --> 01:12.440

- Vitals are stable.

- Who are you?

— Why is it sticking to him?
— Industrial strength adhesive.

01:53.322 --> 01:55.699
I got it.
You know what, Bones?

01:55.783 --> 01:59.321
He was— He was
standing up there,
sticking that to that.

01:59.412 --> 02:02.745
He tripped over his bucket.
The buckets falls,
and he gets stuck.

Right?
There’s a dead dude
stuck to my back?

02:05.293 --> 02:07.875
Bones, why can’t we just,

02:07.962 --> 02:10.704
The adhesive has had
ample time to adhere.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.961
Pulling them apart would
rip off Michelangelo’s skin,

02:14.051 --> 02:16.133
or worse,
completely destroy the evidence.

02:16.220 --> 02:17.721
Worse than ripping off
my skin?

have been fused.

who performed the procedure,
we can identify the victim.

speak clearly, tell the truth,

and I’d have nothing
to worry about.

07:30.409 --> 07:32.821

Donnelly’s my heir apparent.

— And he could sell that?
— Yeah, he can—
could sell anything.

08:01.148 --> 08:04.390
Did anyone
resent Donnelly?
Enough to kill him? No.

08:04.485 --> 08:06.817
Did he have difficulty
with anyone?

08:09.573 --> 08:11.484
hollered at him
in front of everyone.

08:11.575 --> 08:14.783
Claimed he was cheating on her.
Like she’s one to talk.

08:14.870 --> 08:17.031
Are you implying that
she herself was unfaithful?

08:17.122 --> 08:19.829
Implying?
Hell, I’ll say it directly.
She was a cheater.

08:19.917 --> 08:23.876
— And how do you know?
— She cheated on me
with Donnelly.

08:23.962 --> 08:25.827
So you’re telling me
that he stole
your girlfriend.

08:25.964 --> 08:28.421
Wow. That really must
have pissed you off.
At first.

08:28.509 --> 08:31.876
But it’s, like, a year ago.
Wait. Am I a suspect?

08:32.012 --> 08:34.298
Most definitely.
I wanna talk
to the company lawyer.

08:34.431 --> 08:38.424
In a sign of good faith, why
don’t you cough up the name and
the address of the cheater girl?

08:42.773 --> 08:45.890
I had to pry this peanut butter
out of Angela’s hands.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.896
Apparently,
she needed the comfort of some
smooth P.B. this morning...

08:48.987 --> 08:51.820

an illegal right on red.

08:51.907 --> 08:54.273
Ah, police trap.
Corner of Broadway and Nash.

how when you wake up
on Sunday morning,

08:59.540 --> 09:02.998
and you smell your mom
making breakfast?

09:03.085 --> 09:05.747
Your dad’s trying
to make her dance...

09:05.838 --> 09:09.751
to some ancient
Tears for Fears song

09:09.842 --> 09:11.878
It’s weird
when the remains talk.

09:11.969 --> 09:13.425
This is gonna work?

09:13.512 --> 09:15.878
Is that you,
sweet, chocolate angel?

09:15.973 --> 09:18.464
Oh, my God.
What did you give him?

09:18.559 --> 09:21.346
Some stuff for depression,
mood swings, panic disorder—

09:21.437 --> 09:23.018
Okay.
I don’t wanna know.

09:23.105 --> 09:25.562
What I heard—
cup of chamomile tea.

09:25.649 --> 09:28.015
— Okay. We’re done.
- Okay.

09:29.278 --> 09:30.984

Let’s go.

09:40.581 --> 09:44.165

That would be transcendent.

09:44.251 --> 09:47.914
Admit that Seth Zalinsky
is not your only name.

09:48.005 --> 09:51.168
Well, in high school,
they called me Tripod.

09:52.634 --> 09:55.717
Oh, now I’m very sad.

09:57.681 --> 10:00.172
You did this.
You’re Zed.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.553
Zed is not my nickname.

10:02.644 --> 10:04.555
It’s my alter ego.

10:05.731 --> 10:07.437
Much bigger deal.

10:07.524 --> 10:11.108
I’m very honored
to meet you. Really.

10:11.195 --> 10:15.188
I mean, you are a wonderful,
wonderful artist.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.193
And you are really young,

10:17.284 --> 10:19.866
which is so much more
impressive somehow.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.444
I am totally babbling
because I am starstruck.

10:22.539 --> 10:25.531

- You wanna make out?

10:27.753 --> 10:30.620
You know, time was
I would have jumped you,

10:30.714 --> 10:32.625
but I am
a married woman now,

10:32.716 --> 10:35.583
so I’m just gonna kiss you
because of who you are.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.178
Okay?

10:44.937 --> 10:46.723
I felt something move.

10:46.855 --> 10:49.892
Don’t ruin my moment.
On my back.

You really
didn’t have to come, Bones.

to come with you.

— Searching.
— Now you don’t have
to unfold and refold a map.

11:16.260 --> 11:18.342
Wait a second. I like maps.
What’s wrong with maps?

11:18.428 --> 11:22.137
Well, maps cannot tell you
the amount of traffic
you should expect...

11:22.224 --> 11:24.431

This is not how the cowboys
settled this country.

from a skinned knuckle?
Sometimes.

You know, you shouldn’t
feel bad about living
with your sister.

11:47.249 --> 11:49.205
The current trend
of delaying marriage,

11:49.293 --> 11:51.705
along with the economy,
means that people have to adapt.

11:51.795 --> 11:54.411
However, it does
complicate the sex life.

by a falling anvil
or something?

12:12.274 --> 12:14.265
No, that is not correct.

an altercation with him
a few days ago.

12:18.822 --> 12:21.655
I find their upbeat demeanor
highly suspicious.

This is a serious situation.
He may have been murdered.

The victim’s skull
is totally smashed in.

12:55.734 --> 12:59.318
Did I do that when I fell on him?
’Cause I didn’t do it on purpose.

12:59.404 --> 13:02.271
No. The fracture lines
on the zygomatic bones...

13:02.366 --> 13:05.073
indicate the trauma
was sustained
around time of death.

13:05.160 --> 13:09.369
Which was five days
before you fell on him.

Five days ago was Friday—

That felt good.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.227
Almost as good as when
that Asian chick kissed me.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.813
— Wait. What?
- That Asian chick kissed me.

13:44.908 --> 13:50.619
Let’s clean Mr. Zalinsky up,
and in some kind of clothes.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.950
Oh, come on.
I already slathered him
with peanut butter,

now I got to give him
a sponge bath?

did you kiss?

Did the FBI. really
call in a psychiatrist

14:13.437 --> 14:15.928
Now you all think I’m
some sort of psychopath?

14:16.023 --> 14:19.106
I’m actually a psychologist,
Ms. Eaton.

14:19.192 --> 14:22.184
But, um, yes,
Agent Booth called me in...

14:22.279 --> 14:24.270
because he was struck
by your sudden mood swing.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.696
I’m not a psycho.

14:26.783 --> 14:29.616
Can you tell me how you feel
about Morgan Donnelly’s death?

14:29.703 --> 14:31.819
Um, I’m very upset.
Look at me.

14:31.913 --> 14:33.744
Can you tell me
why you laughed?

14:33.832 --> 14:37.495
Because I thought
it was another one
of Morgan’s practical jokes.

14:37.627 --> 14:40.039
He was a joker?
Yes.

14:40.130 --> 14:43.964
And I thought it was his way
of totally making up
aﬁerourﬁght

14:44.092 --> 14:46.799
What fight?
A girl walked up
and kissed him.

14:46.887 --> 14:49.629
I figured he didn’t need
to enjoy it so much.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.714
A girl just walked up
and kissed him?

14:51.808 --> 14:54.925
Yeah, right on the lips.
Some tongue action too.

14:55.020 --> 14:56.885
She recognized him.

14:56.980 --> 15:01.974
What? I was not aware
that telemarketers
attracted that kind of notice.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.310
Morgan was
a comedian, okay?

15:04.404 --> 15:07.646
The telemarketing gig,
it was just temporary.

15:07.741 --> 15:10.528
Okay, that explains
the fake arrow through his head.

15:10.619 --> 15:14.532
Morgan had
an amazing sense of humor.
Girls like that in a guy.

15:14.623 --> 15:17.911
[Voice Cracks ]
Yeah? I always thought
that that was a lie.

15:18.001 --> 15:21.585
So, was Morgan’s
sense of humor the reason
why you left his boss?

15:21.671 --> 15:25.163
Look, if you met Denny,
you’d know why I went
for Morgan.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.749
You think Denny could have
killed Morgan out ofjealousy?

15:27.844 --> 15:31.428
After a year?
Even Denny thinks
faster than that.

15:31.515 --> 15:35.099
Okay, and when was
the last time you saw Morgan?

15:35.185 --> 15:38.222
He came over for dinner
that same night, Friday.

15:38.313 --> 15:40.178
And then I went to work.

15:40.315 --> 15:42.727
I’m a bartender.
You can check that out.
Sure.

15:42.818 --> 15:46.686
And then when I came home,
Morgan wasn’t there.

15:48.865 --> 15:52.858
I didn’t kill Morgan.
I loved him.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.944

should be looking for?

that arrow gag
on his head.

15:57.207 --> 15:59.243
That wasn’t his?
No way.

15:59.334 --> 16:02.872
He hated that shtick stuff.
His material was cerebral.

16:02.963 --> 16:06.797
You wouldn’t by any chance have
footage of Morgan’s stand—up?

16:06.883 --> 16:08.874

recorded every show.

Mr. Fisher, if we are
to determine the murder weapon,

16:18.979 --> 16:21.766

that the remains be clean.

not very skilled at it...

Also how the chip itself
is fragmented.

16:46.089 --> 16:48.330
Huh. One blow
created the chip,

16:48.425 --> 16:50.837
a second or a third
shattered it again.

16:50.927 --> 16:55.136

to laugh defiantly
into the yawning abyss?

— That’s hilarious.
— I’m sorry. I’m trying
to see the hilarity,

17:08.778 --> 17:11.611

until he died.

Oh, Alexa Eaton
and her brother laughed...

17:23.960 --> 17:26.042
because they thought
you and Dr. Brennan
were a prank.

Oh, there’s your motive
for murder right there—
practical jokes.

they hate practical jokers.

17:33.136 --> 17:35.092
The victim was
a stand—up comedian.

17:35.180 --> 17:37.045
Well, that would explain,
you know, the arrow
through the head.

Mm—hmm. The killer
might have been
another stand—up.

17:39.267 --> 17:40.882
Where would you get that?

could have been placed there
as a mark of derision—

21:30.832 --> 21:34.120
Not in, like, a creepy
sex way or anything.
It was in a funny way.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.872
Anyway, you think you could
introduce me to Fisher?

21:36.963 --> 21:40.251
Probably not
’cause of the murder
investigation, huh?

21:40.341 --> 21:42.593
Is it too weird?

21:46.347 --> 21:49.009
You’re gonna get
dermestid beetles
in my peanut butter.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.887
The beetles
will eat what’s left
of the victim’s flesh.

21:51.978 --> 21:55.687
And for peanut butter,
nothing beats
Gromphadorh/na portentosa,

21:55.773 --> 21:58.480
aka. the Madagascar
hissing cockroach.

21:58.568 --> 22:01.105
So, this victim, did you
ever hear of him?

22:01.196 --> 22:02.732
He was a popular comic.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.689
Sure sign you’ve transgressed
the unwritten rule of comedy.

22:05.783 --> 22:08.115
I thought the only rule
in comedy was to be funny.

22:08.244 --> 22:10.951
[ Hissing ]
Tragically, you’re not the only
one who thinks that way.

22:11.039 --> 22:13.701
— Well, if you ask me—
- [ Hissing Continues]

22:13.791 --> 22:16.749

than the Stooges.

22:16.836 --> 22:19.953
Unfettered psychopathic violence!
Hilarious, right?

22:20.048 --> 22:22.505
Not really
when you put it that way.

22:22.592 --> 22:26.380
Might I recommend next time
watching with the volume
turned off?

22:26.471 --> 22:30.259
The absence
of the cartoon sound effects
makes it much more violent.

on stage do their thing.

22:50.078 --> 22:51.909

22:51.996 --> 22:55.329
That’s like telling a Jew
he doesn’t wanna be in Mecca.

22:55.416 --> 22:57.998
In point of fact,
Mecca is the center
of the Muslim world.

22:58.086 --> 23:01.328
It would be completely rational
for a Jew to avoid Mecca,

23:01.422 --> 23:03.162
especially during hajj.

23:03.258 --> 23:05.340
Yeah, I’m fine.

Yeah, I heard that.
It’s terrible.

Is it true
that he once told you,
in front of a crowd,

23:12.809 --> 23:14.891
that if he wanted
to hear from an ass,
he would have farted?

23:22.110 --> 23:24.271
He got a huge laugh too.

23:24.362 --> 23:27.354
We have proof that he humiliated you
at least 20 times in front of audiences.

23:31.035 --> 23:32.650
No, that wasn’t a joke.

I know it wasn’t a joke.
I know what is a joke
and what isn’t a joke.

23:35.999 --> 23:39.082
I’m not sure you do.
Now, don’t heckle him, Bones.
He might want to kill you next.

23:39.168 --> 23:41.079
Oh, you got it all wrong.

23:41.170 --> 23:45.129
Look, me and Morgan—
it was a setup.

23:45.216 --> 23:47.298
— Setup? He wanted you to heckle him?
— Definitely.

23:47.385 --> 23:50.343
Definitely.
All those lines
that he used on me?

23:50.430 --> 23:53.843
You know, like the fart one?
Or he’d say, um,

“There’s an alcoholic
who should stay anonymous.”

— It was my way
of, uh, getting laughs.

24:03.067 --> 24:05.683
Bonus— It made the audience
like Morgan, you know,

24:05.778 --> 24:07.814
so it’s a win—win situation.

24:07.905 --> 24:10.521
Right. Well, thanks
for your cooperation.
Come on.

24:11.409 --> 24:12.899

has a fake arrow
through his head.

24:15.455 --> 24:17.446
Oh. Yeah.

24:17.540 --> 24:20.202
That’s Rex.
And let me tell you.

24:20.293 --> 24:23.535
Now that Donnelly is gone,
he’s gonna get
the Friday night slot,

24:23.630 --> 24:26.246
so that’s got to make you
suspicious, right?

24:26.341 --> 24:28.297
You comedians really
stick together, huh?

24:28.384 --> 24:31.217
This could very well
be the murder weapon.

— Where’s Rex now?
- Uh, he’s warming up.

24:37.352 --> 24:40.185
- Where’s your arrow
through the head?
— Somebody stole it.

24:40.271 --> 24:43.013
I never thought to report it
directly to the FBI.

24:43.107 --> 24:46.224

— Could’ve been anyone.
That bit is classic.

Why?
It wasn’t a you—me kind of kiss.

This was a “musty

is the best kiss that kid ever got.

gonna tell anybody, and—

Mm—mmm. But it is
both self—centered
and self—deprecating.

Joke number two.
“I dated a 14—year—old once,

but I was 14, too,
so it wasn’t a big deal.”

to create something as sweet
and innocent as young love...

31:53.704 --> 31:56.662
Well, how about the guy
who invented tanning beds?

31:56.749 --> 32:01.163
I mean, the nerve.
Who looks at the sun and says,
“Hey, I can do better”?

32:05.841 --> 32:09.254
I went to a cello recital
the other night.
It was— It was a solo show.

32:09.345 --> 32:11.757
Meaning I was the only person
in the audience.

32:11.847 --> 32:14.008
Even I didn’t get that one.

32:14.100 --> 32:17.809
Nobody likes a cello.
It’s just a violin
with size issues,

32:17.895 --> 32:20.102
which is also a joke I wrote,
like the others that you stole.

32:20.189 --> 32:21.929
F.B.I. You’re coming with me.

32:22.024 --> 32:25.642
[ Laughter, Applause]

32:28.030 --> 32:30.612
Annie Pinkus. Right.

32:30.699 --> 32:34.533
So, quite a coincidence
that you work at the same place
as the murder victim.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.657
Two comedians working
a telemarketing dayjob?

32:37.748 --> 32:40.125
Yeah.
Bizarre coincidence there.

32:40.209 --> 32:42.996
Mm. Were you having an affair
with Morgan Donnelly?

32:43.087 --> 32:44.918
No. Why?

32:45.005 --> 32:48.418
It says here Donnelly’s
girlfriend comes in ripping him
a new one about a third woman.

32:48.509 --> 32:50.374
Maybe you didn’t know
about either one of them.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.175
Twice the jealousy,
twice the motive?

32:52.263 --> 32:55.972
Three times.
See, he was stealing yourjokes.
He deserved to die.

32:56.058 --> 32:59.550
I was not sleeping with Morgan,
and he was not stealing myjokes.

32:59.645 --> 33:02.432
Well, I told a couple of yourjokes.
You accused me of stealing.

33:02.523 --> 33:06.232
Yeah, Morgan bought myjokes—
$25 a pop plus a piece
of the back—end deal...

33:06.318 --> 33:09.526
if he went on Letterman,
HBO, you know, whatever.

33:09.613 --> 33:12.150
I could see why you didn’t wanna
save those jokes for yourself.

33:12.241 --> 33:15.278
I’m not funny.
I write funny,
but I’m not funny.

33:15.369 --> 33:17.485
Some people are funny,
like you.

33:17.580 --> 33:20.947
Others like me,
we do better off writing
for the funny people.

33:21.041 --> 33:24.954
So you expect me to believe
that Morgan Donnelly’s death
hurt your career.

33:25.045 --> 33:29.209
Hells yeah. He was about
to move to New York,
do comedy full time.

33:29.300 --> 33:32.383
Is this the real deal
or was this just the pipe dream?

33:32.469 --> 33:35.256
For reals.
He had bookings—
TV shows, clubs.

33:35.347 --> 33:36.848
You can check it out.

33:36.932 --> 33:39.389
Look, what you think
is a motive for me
to murder...

33:39.476 --> 33:42.809
is actually
the complete opposite
of a motive for murder.

33:42.897 --> 33:46.014
That’s irony, and it’s
definitely not funny.

33:46.108 --> 33:47.814
Capisce?

33:52.031 --> 33:54.989
So after pulling out
the postmortem damage...

33:55.075 --> 33:57.612
that was caused
by Zalinsky’s skull,

33:57.703 --> 34:01.241
I used the intersections
of the radiating
fracture lines...

34:01.332 --> 34:03.288
to determine
that the facial trauma...

34:03.375 --> 34:06.367
was actually a result
of three separate blows.

34:06.462 --> 34:08.418
Here are the results
of the initial blow.

34:08.505 --> 34:10.666
[ Fisher]
It appears that
the force of this blow...

34:10.758 --> 34:14.501
and the force of the blow that
broke the victim’s metacarpals
are nearly identical.

34:14.595 --> 34:17.507
The weapon is the same one
that broke his metacarpals.

34:17.598 --> 34:20.465
Please bring up the results
of the second blow.

34:20.559 --> 34:22.550
[ Snickers ]

34:22.645 --> 34:25.637
Uh, fracturing to the dentition,

34:25.731 --> 34:28.347
mandible, maxilla
and zygomatic bones.

34:28.442 --> 34:32.026
The killer either picked up a
larger weapon to finish the job...

34:32.112 --> 34:34.364
or he swung a lighter weapon
with greater force.

34:34.448 --> 34:37.360
Well, here are the results
of the third blow.

34:37.451 --> 34:41.069
[ Snickers ]
Okay, I—I’m sorry.

34:41.163 --> 34:43.745
I know what this
looks like to you,

34:43.832 --> 34:47.450
but this entire sequence here,
it’s the Three Stooges.

34:47.544 --> 34:49.796
It’s classic comedy
in three blows.

34:49.880 --> 34:52.041
I mean, the weapon’s
gonna be a frying pan.

34:53.259 --> 34:56.592
This strike caused
fragments of the glabella...

34:56.720 --> 34:59.302
to pierce
the victim’s brain.
Death blow.

34:59.431 --> 35:01.467
Which is not funny.
[ Brennan ]
No, it’s not.

35:01.558 --> 35:03.685
Based on the amorphous
wound pattern,

35:03.769 --> 35:07.432
the murder weapon is curved
upon its horizontal axis.

35:07.523 --> 35:10.890
Curved, ceramic,
like a large vase?

35:10.985 --> 35:14.898
Angie, Ijust sent you
the results of the core sample
I took from the shard of ceramic.

35:15.030 --> 35:18.193
Hmm. Was it a vase?
Not unless it was
a vase full of urine.

35:18.325 --> 35:20.190
It was a toilet?
[ Hodgins ]
Ding—ding—ding!

35:20.286 --> 35:23.369
And the prize
goes to the little lady
wearing the blue lab coat.

35:23.455 --> 35:26.538
Sorry. Yeah, I— I got excited.

35:26.625 --> 35:29.788
[ Fisher]
So his head was smashed
into a toilet? Classic.

35:29.878 --> 35:32.711
The first blow occurred...

35:32.798 --> 35:35.961
when the victim had his hand
on the edge of the toilet.

35:36.051 --> 35:38.007
His face was smashed
into his hand.

35:38.095 --> 35:40.632

by a brutal swirly.

35:40.723 --> 35:43.465

over the toilet, puking,
when he was killed.

35:45.894 --> 35:48.271
I’m— Swirly.

So, how many toilets are there
in the metro DC. area?

35:54.987 --> 35:57.444
Oh. Uh, approximately
five and a half million.

35:57.531 --> 35:59.146
How is that you know that?

35:59.241 --> 36:02.733
There is approximately
one toilet per person
in the United States of America.

36:02.828 --> 36:05.319
Do you want me to figure out
how much time it would take
to inspect each toilet?

36:05.414 --> 36:07.325
- No, we don’t have
to do that.
— Why not?

36:07.416 --> 36:09.247
Why? I’ll just get,
you know, a warrant...

36:09.335 --> 36:12.793
for all the toilets that
the victim used regularly,

36:12.880 --> 36:14.336
and we’ll start with that.

36:14.423 --> 36:17.540
And when I say “we,”
I mean Hodgins.

36:17.634 --> 36:20.592
1,250,000 man—hours.

36:20.721 --> 36:24.555
W-What?
That’s how long it would take
to check out every toilet in DC.

you don’t stop, right?

like that, don’t you?

watch some soccer game

my cooking killed Morgan?

that Morgan became ill
that night.

while vomiting into your toilet.

to make people helpless
