00:07.100 --> 00:10.980
Hey, put that one in the front
where it can be seen.

00:10.980 --> 00:13.500
You need your glasses? It's bruised.

00:13.500 --> 00:16.780
It's bruised, I know it's bruised,
you know it's bruised,

00:16.780 --> 00:21.820
and soon Mrs Thing will know it's
bruised. It's a Mrs Thing trap.

00:21.820 --> 00:24.140
Mm, she's got a bigger
trap than you.

00:24.140 --> 00:27.780
I'm fed up with her coming in,
poking and prodding

00:27.780 --> 00:31.540
and I never get her in the shop...

00:31.540 --> 00:34.620
but today she is mine.

00:36.940 --> 00:38.460
Eh, up.

00:40.580 --> 00:43.580
Oh, dear. Mm, oh.

00:43.580 --> 00:45.100
I'm just looking.

00:45.100 --> 00:46.260
Oh, carry on.

00:46.260 --> 00:47.460
Are these fresh?

00:47.460 --> 00:50.300
Oh, yes, any fresher
and they'd be insulting.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.900
This one's bruised.

00:52.900 --> 00:55.060
Oh, congratulations.

00:55.060 --> 00:59.260
You see, by spotting that, you've
just won my discerning customer award

00:59.260 --> 01:04.099
which means that you can purchase a
pack of yoghurt for less than cost.

01:05.780 --> 01:08.460
This young man here,
he worries about me

01:08.460 --> 01:12.380
practically giving stuff away,
and I say to him,

01:12.380 --> 01:15.660
I say, "Leroy, don't you worry
about the loss,

01:15.660 --> 01:19.300
"think of it more as...
a community service."

01:19.300 --> 01:22.740
There you are. Up you go.

01:22.740 --> 01:27.180
How can you claim that it's
less than cost?

01:27.180 --> 01:31.580
Well, it's bound to be less than
the cost of something, ain't it?

01:55.940 --> 01:57.820
BARKING

02:05.980 --> 02:07.260
Hey!

02:30.980 --> 02:32.420
Hey!

02:36.660 --> 02:40.820
Explain to me why you bought
this load of old damaged tins?

02:40.820 --> 02:43.100
Grocer's intuition, Leroy.

02:43.100 --> 02:48.140
Little voice in my ear went, "Hey,
hey, eh, up, they're cheap."

02:48.140 --> 02:50.500
You'll never sell them
in this condition

02:50.500 --> 02:53.220
and I am not eating them
for the next six months.

02:53.220 --> 02:55.140
Oh, have a little faith, Leroy.

02:58.540 --> 03:00.340
I'm out of bread.

03:00.340 --> 03:03.460
What have you got from yesterday
that's not stale?

03:03.460 --> 03:05.260
Oh, I've got a nice brown cob.

03:05.260 --> 03:06.780
Oh, I'll take that.

03:10.340 --> 03:11.580
There we are.

03:11.580 --> 03:13.140
It's a bit flat.

03:14.460 --> 03:16.500
It's not a musical instrument.

03:17.900 --> 03:21.660
Shouldn't it be, you know,
more puffed up?

03:21.660 --> 03:23.140
You want puffed up?

03:24.980 --> 03:27.300
All right, all right.

03:27.300 --> 03:30.260
I'll see what I've got
out the back, all right?

03:35.700 --> 03:38.300
I bet you think
I'm a fussy old woman.

03:38.300 --> 03:40.900
The woman bit never crossed my mind.

03:40.900 --> 03:43.500
Sometimes you have to make a stand.

03:44.660 --> 03:46.940
- Have you got any...?
BARKING

03:50.260 --> 03:52.100
I think the dog prefers Tesco's.

03:57.260 --> 03:59.500
How long are you going to be...?

04:11.660 --> 04:15.700
It's another little te-he-he-tip
I owe you for.

04:21.339 --> 04:22.740
Ha ha.

04:22.740 --> 04:24.500
You happy now?

04:24.500 --> 04:27.780
You see, you're feeling monkey at me
now because of this bread.

04:27.780 --> 04:31.460
You could have sold me that stale
one if I hadn't have been too sharp.

04:33.180 --> 04:35.700
I know when I'm beaten.

04:35.700 --> 04:37.940
No hard feelings, eh?

04:37.940 --> 04:39.580
I like a good loser.

04:41.780 --> 04:43.860
What have you got
for a wife in a paddy?

04:45.460 --> 04:47.260
You haven't upset her
already, have you?

04:47.260 --> 04:50.020
She brought this one with her
to bed last night.

04:51.860 --> 04:55.380
Eh up, Eric, you're up and about
early, ain't you?

04:55.380 --> 04:59.260
Nicer outside.
Weather's terrible indoors.

05:00.580 --> 05:02.140
You and all?

05:02.140 --> 05:03.700
You say one wrong word.

05:03.700 --> 05:06.340
Mine kicks off
before you can even speak.

05:06.340 --> 05:09.100
You should speak first
and don't stop.

05:09.100 --> 05:12.140
Don't give them any pauses,
pauses are fatal.

05:13.140 --> 05:15.260
Anyway, what was this wrong word?

05:15.260 --> 05:17.020
Bridlington.

05:17.020 --> 05:19.140
What's wrong with Bridlington?

05:19.140 --> 05:21.860
She shook me awake and she said,

05:21.860 --> 05:25.020
"I want you to surprise me
and spoil me

05:25.020 --> 05:28.460
"and take me somewhere for a magical
new experience,"

05:28.460 --> 05:29.820
and all I said was...

05:29.820 --> 05:31.020
ALL: Bridlington.

05:36.260 --> 05:40.620
Arkwright's. This is where
she let herself be ripped off,

05:40.620 --> 05:43.140
buying something he said was called
"yaggis".

05:43.140 --> 05:45.420
Can't she see it was just salami?

05:45.420 --> 05:46.820
Silly woman.

05:49.540 --> 05:54.060
He's looking increasingly like your
typical weirdo, just sitting there.

05:54.060 --> 05:58.500
I don't recognise the car.
I'll see him off in a minute.

05:58.500 --> 06:01.660
Can you do that? Without your pole
and away from your crossing?

06:01.660 --> 06:05.500
I don't see why not.
He's away from wherever he belongs.

06:07.140 --> 06:10.100
Simple plain salami,
how dim can she be?

06:10.100 --> 06:13.020
Not dim enough to come and complain
personally, no,

06:13.020 --> 06:15.940
she has to send me.
"Go and sort him out," she says,

06:15.940 --> 06:18.740
"get the money back,
get an apology."

06:18.740 --> 06:22.700
Yaggis! Jordan,
you married a dimwit,

06:22.700 --> 06:25.780
and now I have to go
and punish this guy.

06:26.860 --> 06:28.380
GASTRIC YELLS

06:29.740 --> 06:32.780
Oh, begger, that sucks, good start.

06:32.780 --> 06:35.380
Let's hope there were no
witnesses...

06:38.020 --> 06:39.340
We saw that.

06:39.340 --> 06:41.100
Saw you fling that door at him.

06:41.100 --> 06:44.260
Saw you sitting there
waiting for him.

06:44.260 --> 06:46.740
Are you still unconscious, Gastric?

06:46.740 --> 06:48.500
Thank you for asking.

06:48.500 --> 06:51.340
I were wondering if anybody cared.

06:52.460 --> 06:54.140
HE GROANS

06:58.220 --> 07:02.460
48 battered tins of beans in
chilli sauce to get rid of.

07:02.460 --> 07:06.620
Stay calm, Leroy.
We have the technology.

07:09.380 --> 07:10.940
Hello, Mavis.

07:12.260 --> 07:13.540
Hello, Granville.

07:16.860 --> 07:19.500
Oh! Oh, yeah, right, yeah, yeah,
sorry.

07:19.500 --> 07:23.660
Got to go
and see to my fairy cakes.

07:23.660 --> 07:25.860
Nah, it's good to see you, Mavis.

07:25.860 --> 07:27.300
You too, Leroy.

07:34.660 --> 07:38.220
Where is she
from whom there is no mercy?

07:38.220 --> 07:41.420
She's doing Kath's hair. Walnuts.

07:44.460 --> 07:45.660
Sorry?

07:45.660 --> 07:47.660
It's what I came in for, walnuts.

07:47.660 --> 07:51.060
- Ah.
- I thought I'd better get it in
quick before I forget,

07:51.060 --> 07:52.500
you know what I'm like.

07:53.580 --> 07:56.740
And there was something else,
but that's gone.

07:56.740 --> 08:00.060
It'll come back to you,
and if it doesn't,

08:00.060 --> 08:02.180
I will.

08:04.500 --> 08:08.140
As long as you leave
the window open just a fraction.

08:10.620 --> 08:13.420
No wonder I forget things,
you make me blush.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.540
There is a cure.

08:16.540 --> 08:18.820
All you have to do
is to close your eyes,

08:18.820 --> 08:21.660
say the magic word
and when you open them,

08:21.660 --> 08:24.540
you're in this fairy-tale bedroom.

08:24.540 --> 08:28.020
Leroy says his
and your bedrooms are full of boxes.

08:30.460 --> 08:35.179
Well, that's all right, I'll get rid
of all of my boxes into Leroy's room

08:35.179 --> 08:38.500
and then I'll get some nice soft
lighting

08:38.500 --> 08:41.179
and an alarm clock

08:41.179 --> 08:42.980
with a snooze button

08:42.980 --> 08:46.460
and some silk pyjamas.

08:46.460 --> 08:49.180
That's been knocked about a bit.

08:50.740 --> 08:53.100
It won't notice in silk pyjamas.

08:56.900 --> 08:59.860
Oh, you mean the tin?

08:59.860 --> 09:03.300
Yes, yes. Well, it's been
in some rough hands.

09:03.300 --> 09:06.260
Oh, I know the feeling.

09:06.260 --> 09:08.820
Listen, talking about that.

09:08.820 --> 09:12.540
You know, when I look into your eyes,

09:12.540 --> 09:14.940
I see these great legs.

09:17.340 --> 09:19.820
- Have you got any...?
- No!

09:23.460 --> 09:25.220
You've lost a customer!

09:25.220 --> 09:28.740
Don't just stay there seducing me,
go and get him back!

09:28.740 --> 09:32.020
Oh... Oh, all right.

09:34.820 --> 09:37.180
Oh... Ooh.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.620
Oh, this is a tough one, this!

09:42.620 --> 09:43.660
Go!

09:43.660 --> 09:46.340
Go, all right, yes.

09:54.140 --> 09:58.340
Balance seems all right. Is your
head ringing, Gastric?

09:58.340 --> 10:01.020
If it is don't answer it,
it'll be full of tripe.

10:02.380 --> 10:05.300
It's a good job you're built
for punishment, Gastric,

10:05.300 --> 10:07.740
and you're not some jessie.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.820
Oh, I can't see any blood...

10:09.820 --> 10:11.420
No thanks to you.

10:11.420 --> 10:13.220
He looks unscratched to me.

10:13.220 --> 10:15.980
You must be a very aggressive
personality,

10:15.980 --> 10:18.900
thrusting your door
in other people's faces.

10:18.900 --> 10:20.340
I'm a pussycat.

10:20.340 --> 10:21.860
You want neutering then.

10:23.140 --> 10:25.380
It's a good job for you
it's only Gastric

10:25.380 --> 10:27.580
and not somebody
we really care about.

10:29.260 --> 10:31.020
Thank you, Mrs Featherstone.

10:31.020 --> 10:33.580
No offence, Gastric.
We came to your rescue,

10:33.580 --> 10:35.180
we did everything you could

10:35.180 --> 10:37.980
reasonably expect
from a casual acquaintance.

10:37.980 --> 10:41.740
We've got your number, Mister,
in case he has a relapse later.

10:41.740 --> 10:44.940
Bring your bike,
you'd better wheel it for a while.

10:48.540 --> 10:50.300
What would your mother think?

10:50.300 --> 10:51.500
She's dead.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.860
Well, that should've made
her opinion clear enough.

11:11.700 --> 11:15.340
That's a bit of strenuous grocering.
What you doing?

11:15.340 --> 11:18.900
Yes, I'm just dressing this tin.

11:18.900 --> 11:20.620
Dressing it?

11:20.620 --> 11:23.620
- Mm.
- You made a bog of it!

11:23.620 --> 11:27.020
If I told you this effect
was precisely planned...

11:27.020 --> 11:29.740
- Do you mean you did it deliberately?
- Yes.

11:29.740 --> 11:31.300
That was you banging this tin?

11:31.300 --> 11:33.180
Mm, and now I put it to one side,

11:33.180 --> 11:35.820
that's for tonight's supper,
me and Leroy's.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.820
Ah, I'm glad you're not
trying to sell it.

11:37.820 --> 11:42.660
Oh! Oh, no, no, no. I wouldn't waste
this on people with low self cuisine.

11:46.700 --> 11:49.260
Oh, sorry,
what is it I could get you, this?

11:49.260 --> 11:50.340
Er, aye, yeah.

11:50.340 --> 11:53.420
Right, there we go,
that's just about right, thank you.

11:54.540 --> 11:57.380
How do you mean dressing it?

11:57.380 --> 11:59.980
Well, by putting the insertions in.

11:59.980 --> 12:01.060
Dents, you mean?

12:01.060 --> 12:03.780
Well, no, from the outside,
they do look like dents, don't they?

12:03.780 --> 12:06.260
But from the inside
they're insertions.

12:06.260 --> 12:08.380
Insertions into the contents.

12:10.220 --> 12:14.740
You know, authoritative people
do say that it doubles the flavour.

12:16.940 --> 12:20.500
Give over, you do tell me
some flannel.

12:21.780 --> 12:23.060
Oh, you're right, I mean,

12:23.060 --> 12:25.660
I don't think it doubles the flavour
necessarily,

12:25.660 --> 12:28.620
but it certainly gives the contents
a boost.

12:28.620 --> 12:30.540
Oh, yeah, mm.

12:32.020 --> 12:33.900
I shouldn't be telling you this

12:33.900 --> 12:37.580
because it's the best kept secret
in the grocery trade.

12:37.580 --> 12:39.900
- How can...
- Impact.

12:39.900 --> 12:43.060
You see, it's all
to do with its, like,

12:43.060 --> 12:45.300
you know, molecular structure,

12:45.300 --> 12:49.060
but I don't want to get into quantum
physics with you.

12:51.660 --> 12:55.460
So they take you on holiday and if
it's fine they want you to sit

12:55.460 --> 12:58.860
in a deck chair, and if it's wet
they want you to sit in a pub.

12:58.860 --> 13:00.580
Mm, been there, done that.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.460
So you say, let's do something,

13:02.460 --> 13:06.180
so they offer you the choice
of miniature golf or going fishing.

13:06.180 --> 13:09.460
All of a sudden,
the deck chair looks better.

13:09.460 --> 13:12.860
We never went on holiday,
he used to go by himself,

13:12.860 --> 13:14.700
he said I wouldn't enjoy it.

13:15.860 --> 13:18.140
You were stupid with him.

13:18.140 --> 13:21.140
According to him,
I was stupid without him.

13:21.140 --> 13:25.780
No, you weren't.
You just had low self esteem.

13:25.780 --> 13:30.620
Oh, ha! That's another thing,
husbands have all the qualifications

13:30.620 --> 13:34.460
to have low self esteem,
so how come they don't have any?

13:34.460 --> 13:37.340
He had self esteem
enough for both of us.

13:37.340 --> 13:41.100
Well, they do, they sit around
all day but you're supposed

13:41.100 --> 13:45.820
to recognise that underneath they're
still this dynamic, athletic figure.

13:45.820 --> 13:48.420
Not easy when you're ironing
their underwear.

13:50.740 --> 13:53.380
Well, I've told Eric,
he's on notice.

13:53.380 --> 13:56.340
We're not going anywhere
till he wakes his ideas up.

13:58.260 --> 14:00.940
Best kept secret
of the grocery trade.

14:00.940 --> 14:03.020
I thought that was food poisoning.

14:04.380 --> 14:06.140
He's asked me to keep it quiet.

14:06.140 --> 14:08.620
I'm not supposed to be
flashing this about.

14:09.780 --> 14:13.100
He dressed this one for me
as a favour.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.540
So explain to me how...

14:16.540 --> 14:20.500
It's a molecular thing, let's not
get into quantum physics, eh?

14:20.500 --> 14:22.180
Well, fine by me.

14:23.820 --> 14:26.740
It doubles the flavour.
It's worth a try.

14:29.100 --> 14:32.340
I've got one at home that could do
with her flavour improving.

14:32.340 --> 14:34.700
Me too, a few years under your belt

14:34.700 --> 14:38.060
and they think that you've lost
all your fizz and sparkle.

14:38.060 --> 14:40.420
Has he got any more?

14:40.420 --> 14:42.020
It's supposed to be a trade secret.

14:42.020 --> 14:44.740
Hey, I'm tight-lipped.

14:44.740 --> 14:48.500
I'm a sphinx. Ask the wife.

14:48.500 --> 14:51.940
she's always looking at me and
demanding, "Well, say something."

15:05.020 --> 15:06.900
Look, I'm supposed to be delivering.

15:06.900 --> 15:09.180
If you'd stop struggling,
I am delivering.

15:14.140 --> 15:15.700
You're getting married soon.

15:15.700 --> 15:17.500
I know, I can't wait.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.700
Oh, I've forgotten what the next
address is now.

15:24.700 --> 15:26.940
- Am I disturbing you?
- Yes.

15:26.940 --> 15:28.540
- Good.
- It's not good.

15:28.540 --> 15:30.260
Oh, come on, it's not bad.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.620
Yeah.

15:35.740 --> 15:39.580
Men, and I say this from several
unfortunate experiences,

15:39.580 --> 15:41.580
are peculiar.

15:41.580 --> 15:43.220
Well, they look peculiar from some

15:43.220 --> 15:45.060
of the angles a nurse has to get
used to.

15:45.060 --> 15:47.380
Oh, I couldn't be doing
with angles like that.

15:47.380 --> 15:50.020
For me,
they have to be in suit and tie.

15:50.020 --> 15:51.620
Even in bed?

15:51.620 --> 15:54.380
Well, if you buy them
the right pyjamas,

15:54.380 --> 15:56.700
there's almost as much material.

15:56.700 --> 16:00.020
There's a measure of safety
in thick flannelette.

16:00.020 --> 16:02.980
You're wary of men,
yet you married three times.

16:02.980 --> 16:05.380
That's like banging
your head repeatedly.

16:05.380 --> 16:08.100
I suppose I must be a romantic.

16:08.100 --> 16:11.340
They look so attractive in that
moment that you first see

16:11.340 --> 16:12.900
that they're easily led.

16:12.900 --> 16:15.980
Speaking of which,
how is Mr Newbold?

16:15.980 --> 16:18.980
No sign of him yet coming
in number four,

16:18.980 --> 16:20.860
but I'll bring him round.

16:20.860 --> 16:23.420
I'll show him my softer Delphine.

16:23.420 --> 16:24.860
That we'd all like to see.

16:24.860 --> 16:28.100
It's like learning Hitler
was a dress designer.

16:29.500 --> 16:32.780
Oh, it's there, just needs the right
man to bring it out.

16:32.780 --> 16:35.620
I wasn't called Pixie for nothing.

16:35.620 --> 16:39.300
Pixie?! Who called you Pixie?

16:39.300 --> 16:43.060
My second husband, the one who was
knocked down by a bus.

16:43.060 --> 16:46.660
Not surprised if he couldn't see
better than that.

16:46.660 --> 16:50.380
I remember him heavily bandaged
in hospital.

16:50.380 --> 16:54.140
He saw me coming
and through his pain he said...

16:54.140 --> 16:56.980
"Pixie."

16:56.980 --> 17:00.340
Doctor claimed what he said
was "pig sick."

17:01.540 --> 17:03.460
But she disliked me

17:03.460 --> 17:06.020
because I'd queried
his urine sample.

17:08.980 --> 17:11.819
I ran into Cyril,
he tried to hide it

17:11.819 --> 17:14.380
but I could see this battered tin.

17:14.380 --> 17:17.140
Yes, in the trade
we call it a dressed tin.

17:17.140 --> 17:22.060
Oh, and then I ran into Eric
and I saw his...dressed tin.

17:22.060 --> 17:25.420
- But I could see that he didn't
want to talk about it either.
- Oh.

17:25.420 --> 17:27.700
Which always makes you curious.

17:27.700 --> 17:31.860
And you don't like asking
but I made an exception.

17:34.380 --> 17:37.140
Well, I see that you've got me
over a barrel,

17:37.140 --> 17:41.780
I suppose I could always,
I could always dress another tin.

17:41.780 --> 17:43.420
Yes, yes, yeah.

17:43.420 --> 17:46.580
What about beans in chilli sauce?

17:46.580 --> 17:48.460
Oh, lovely!

17:48.460 --> 17:52.820
Right, OK, let's have a
look at this one then. Mm.

17:55.700 --> 18:00.620
Oh yes, this looks like it needs
the Mittelhauser procedure.

18:02.140 --> 18:03.660
Mittelhauser?

18:03.660 --> 18:07.060
Oh, yes, yes.
Carl Adelbert Mittelhauser, yes.

18:09.380 --> 18:12.020
Very famous tin dresser.

18:12.020 --> 18:16.660
He was tin dresser to
Mad King Ludwig of Bavaria.

18:16.660 --> 18:19.220
He used to dress
all his tins, you know?

18:19.220 --> 18:22.420
Yes. Got a medal for it,
and a pension.

18:24.420 --> 18:27.220
He helped him marry
his childhood sweetheart.

18:27.220 --> 18:28.780
Ah.

18:28.780 --> 18:30.260
Yeah, just in time.

18:30.260 --> 18:31.860
Oh.

18:31.860 --> 18:34.820
Yeah. Right, OK, let's see now.

18:38.380 --> 18:43.820
I think this one needs the
Mittelhauser transverse opening blow,

18:43.820 --> 18:48.180
which I'm about to execute
as we speak, all right.

19:13.940 --> 19:15.300
- Oh, yes.
- Oh!

19:15.300 --> 19:17.660
- There you are,
that should do it, yes.
- Oh.

19:17.660 --> 19:19.900
- Put it in your bag, yes.
- Oh, oh, thank you, Granville.

19:19.900 --> 19:21.860
Yes, shh, don't let anybody see it.

19:21.860 --> 19:25.180
- No, I won't.
- All right, yes. Shh!

19:27.180 --> 19:30.260
Oh, look, it's the smiley twins.

19:32.740 --> 19:36.860
If you're looking for assisted dying,
it's that way up the road.

19:36.860 --> 19:39.940
- We're having a problem
with our image.
- Oh?

19:39.940 --> 19:41.940
There's been some loss of respect.

19:41.940 --> 19:44.020
Which is totally undeserved.

19:44.020 --> 19:45.740
She thinks I'm a muppet.

19:45.740 --> 19:48.500
I think he's a muppet
but I'm not married to him

19:48.500 --> 19:52.540
so I think his resentment
is justified.

19:52.540 --> 19:54.820
Thank you, fellow muppet.

19:54.820 --> 19:59.380
We're in the deep doo-doo,
Granville.

19:59.380 --> 20:02.100
She didn't like that dressed tin.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.780
Mine hadn't even heard
of quantum physics.

20:06.420 --> 20:10.180
What can you do when you've lost
that electric attraction

20:10.180 --> 20:12.020
you once had for your woman?

20:12.020 --> 20:14.140
Fuses have been blown, Granville.

20:16.660 --> 20:20.940
And I can tell you why, that is,
if you've come here to spend

20:20.940 --> 20:23.100
and not fritter my time away.

20:24.220 --> 20:26.860
We'll spend, if we have to...

20:26.860 --> 20:28.860
And within reason.

20:28.860 --> 20:31.260
You see,
there's your problem already.

20:31.260 --> 20:34.180
You're not spontaneous enough.

20:34.180 --> 20:38.140
You're not reckless,
you're too cautions.

20:38.140 --> 20:40.420
I've got a mountain bike
with ten speeds.

20:42.020 --> 20:46.820
I've got a pair of boxer shorts with
a map of the London Underground on.

20:46.820 --> 20:51.780
When was the last time that you two
surprised your wives?

20:52.980 --> 20:57.140
Well, every time I do
she has a headache.

20:57.140 --> 20:59.780
It's not easy with
the mother on the premises.

20:59.780 --> 21:03.780
Well, you've lost your shock value,
you see, that's your problem.

21:03.780 --> 21:06.500
You've given up,
they're bored with your routine,

21:06.500 --> 21:09.060
you, you need to shake 'em up a bit.

21:09.060 --> 21:12.620
You're talking about a wife who can
pop a vicious left jab here.

21:13.860 --> 21:19.420
It'll have to be a shake that didn't
trigger any violent countermeasures.

21:19.420 --> 21:23.180
Think back to when they thought
that you were the man.

21:23.180 --> 21:25.900
Think back to when
you were courting them

21:25.900 --> 21:31.060
and you used to surprise them,
you know, with little gifts, eh?

21:31.060 --> 21:32.340
Mm.

21:37.100 --> 21:39.540
Hey! Hey up! Spend!

21:49.540 --> 21:51.500
Hello, a new face.

21:51.500 --> 21:55.060
You sold my wife
something you called yaggis.

21:56.420 --> 21:58.140
It was salami.

21:58.140 --> 22:02.660
Ah, you see now
one of the advantages of yaggis,

22:02.660 --> 22:05.540
apart from its erotic effects...

22:07.340 --> 22:10.860
..is that it looks
and tastes like salami.

22:12.380 --> 22:13.820
Erotic effects?

22:19.380 --> 22:21.820
You didn't notice?

22:21.820 --> 22:22.900
I didn't eat it.

22:22.900 --> 22:26.300
Well, it is advisable to eat it
together, unless of course

22:26.300 --> 22:30.340
you want your partner to achieve
lift off unilaterally.

22:32.100 --> 22:35.820
Has she been, er, sneaking out
more recently?

22:35.820 --> 22:38.700
Well, she plays golf,
I wouldn't call that sneaking out.

22:38.700 --> 22:40.740
Oh, more golf than usual?

22:40.740 --> 22:42.460
She's got a tournament coming.

22:42.460 --> 22:45.780
Ah. More golf.

22:47.100 --> 22:51.500
I think you're going to need half
a yaggis, you need to play catch up.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.340
Oh, I'm not falling for that.

22:53.340 --> 22:55.980
You're not dealing with some
dozy female now.

23:03.340 --> 23:06.940
Oh, er, sir, just,
just a moment.

23:06.940 --> 23:10.540
Guess what he had for breakfast.

23:23.220 --> 23:25.260
Of course she's golfing.

23:25.260 --> 23:28.660
If she tells me she's going golfing
then she's golfing.

23:28.660 --> 23:31.220
She takes that pricey set of clubs
with her,

23:31.220 --> 23:33.060
where else would she be going?

23:35.260 --> 23:37.980
Lois? Where are you?

23:37.980 --> 23:40.820
What do you mean, "What do you mean,
'where are you?'"

23:40.820 --> 23:43.420
A husband's entitled
to know where his wife is.

23:46.180 --> 23:50.260
You sound out of breath, Lois.
Why are you breathing heavy?

23:50.260 --> 23:51.940
But how do I know you're golfing.

23:59.300 --> 24:02.180
She is golfing, I just called her.

24:02.180 --> 24:05.460
Healthy, outdoors,
innocent activity.

24:05.460 --> 24:08.220
I know she's outdoors,
I heard the birds singing.

24:09.780 --> 24:12.820
A-ha, yes, sunshine, fresh air.

24:12.820 --> 24:14.140
Exactly.

24:14.140 --> 24:17.460
Birds singing. Yeah.

24:17.460 --> 24:21.860
I'm thinking picnic, you know,
a lot of goodies spread

24:21.860 --> 24:25.820
out on a blanket, maybe a bottle
of wine...

24:27.420 --> 24:29.420
clink of glasses...

24:31.460 --> 24:34.660
A female voice huskier than usual,

24:36.420 --> 24:38.460
murmuring contentedly.

24:44.180 --> 24:46.100
It's a simple question, Lois!

24:46.100 --> 24:48.740
How much of that damned yaggis
have you been eating?

24:48.740 --> 24:51.900
He admits it tastes like salami!
That's one effect.

24:51.900 --> 24:54.300
But what about the other?

24:54.300 --> 24:58.540
Oh, don't come the innocent,
you know what other!

24:58.540 --> 25:02.540
Don't tell me you haven't been
enjoying a bit of the other.

25:02.540 --> 25:05.620
I heard the birds singing,
the clink of glasses!

25:06.940 --> 25:09.940
Don't you dare hang up on me. Lois!

25:09.940 --> 25:11.380
Lois!

25:18.020 --> 25:19.260
CAR HORN

25:58.860 --> 26:01.380
Ye gods, that yaggis!

26:24.780 --> 26:26.540
Chuff me,
they're all on it.

26:29.060 --> 26:32.140
Ah, Granville, I won't keep you
a moment.

26:32.140 --> 26:34.020
Before I go to Mr Newbold,

26:34.020 --> 26:37.220
I want to remind you what you could
be missing.

26:50.500 --> 26:52.620
When are you expecting more yaggis?

26:52.620 --> 26:56.300
I could let you have some of that
till we get the next delivery.

26:56.300 --> 26:58.940
- I'll take it.
- Good for you. Ha.

27:05.620 --> 27:10.700
'They've been googling Mittelhauser,
Carl Adelbert.

27:10.700 --> 27:13.980
'Huh, it's getting harder to pull
their legs.

27:17.060 --> 27:19.540
'It's a nice night,

27:19.540 --> 27:22.740
'I hope there's someone out there
enjoying his yaggis.

27:24.620 --> 27:27.460
'If you're listening, Arkwright,
don't throw a wobbler

27:27.460 --> 27:30.860
'but I thought I might surprise
Mavis with a holiday.

27:35.460 --> 27:37.780
'Or maybe a day trip.'

27:41.700 --> 27:44.780
Oh, fish and chips?

27:44.780 --> 27:46.220
My turn.

27:46.220 --> 27:48.020
Oh.

28:02.540 --> 28:06.300
'Oh, Lord, I love a generous woman.'
