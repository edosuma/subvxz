00:06.340 --> 00:07.141
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:08.509 --> 00:09.877
sexually based offenses

00:09.910 --> 00:12.046
are considered
especially heinous.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.548
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.582 --> 00:16.384
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.417 --> 00:17.918
are members of an elite squad

00:17.951 --> 00:20.088
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:20.121 --> 00:22.123
These are their stories.

00:24.292 --> 00:27.928
- Welcome back to
"Heart's Desire" live in NYC.

00:27.961 --> 00:29.430
I'm your host,
John Valentine.

[cheers and applause]

00:32.466 --> 00:34.702
[upbeat music]

00:34.735 --> 00:36.104
It is week six,

00:36.137 --> 00:38.339
and we are down
to three men and four women,

00:38.372 --> 00:40.074
which means that one of these
lovely young ladies

00:40.108 --> 00:43.677
will be going home at the end
of tonight's broadcast.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.513
Over the last few days,

00:45.546 --> 00:49.583
Melanie and Gigi have been
competing for one man's heart,

00:49.617 --> 00:52.253
Ryan,
our tennis pro from San Diego.

00:52.286 --> 00:55.256
[cheers and applause]

00:55.289 --> 00:57.358
*

00:57.391 --> 00:58.692
Tonight,
the journey to true love

00:58.726 --> 01:01.028
comes to a dramatic climax

01:01.129 --> 01:04.498
when Ryan chooses
his heart's desire.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.767
Melanie, how are you feeling?

01:06.800 --> 01:07.835
- Really great.

01:07.868 --> 01:10.338
Our date was magical.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.673
- Maybe for you, but I know
Ryan is falling for me.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.508
- I'm sorry,
can you turn this off?

01:14.542 --> 01:15.909
- Or just throw the TV out?

01:15.943 --> 01:17.945
- John, but Gigi doesn't...

01:17.978 --> 01:20.013
- Who actually watches
this show?

01:20.047 --> 01:22.183
- I just want to spend
all of my time with him.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.218
[audience reacts]

01:24.252 --> 01:26.154
- God, you're sounding
very needy.

01:26.154 --> 01:28.822
Maybe that's why
he's not into you.

01:28.856 --> 01:30.624
- Ooh, look at that brunette
throwing shade.

01:30.658 --> 01:32.726
- Yeah,
Gigi is a total witch.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.228
Me and Frannie are Team Melanie,
aren't we?

01:34.262 --> 01:36.397
- I know it's only been
six weeks,

01:36.430 --> 01:38.732
but Ryan is the guy
of my dreams.

01:38.766 --> 01:41.402
[cheers and applause]

01:41.435 --> 01:42.970
- And Gigi...
- Yeah.

01:43.003 --> 01:44.405
- How was your date
with Ryan this week?

01:44.438 --> 01:47.641
- Well,
we went on a helicopter ride.

01:47.675 --> 01:50.644
[sentimental music]

01:50.678 --> 01:52.646
*

01:52.680 --> 01:55.849
It was steamy!

01:55.883 --> 01:57.218
[light applause]

01:57.251 --> 01:59.353
- Yeah.

01:59.387 --> 02:01.489
- The skyline was beautiful,

02:01.522 --> 02:05.693
but the windows got so fogged
we could only see each other.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.262
[laughs]

02:08.296 --> 02:09.563
- That does sound steamy.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.265
And what about your date,
Melanie?

02:11.299 --> 02:14.568
- Quiet, but Ryan and I
truly connected.

02:14.602 --> 02:16.937
- You did?

02:16.970 --> 02:18.639
*

02:18.672 --> 02:22.009
- We went on a carriage ride.

02:22.042 --> 02:24.478
Being in the most romantic city

02:24.512 --> 02:26.514
in the arms
of the sweetest guy,

02:26.547 --> 02:29.417
I just felt like
a real-life Disney princess.

02:29.450 --> 02:30.484

02:30.518 --> 02:31.585
[cheers and applause]

02:31.619 --> 02:32.620
- Oh, no.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.655
No, no guy wants to hear that.

02:34.688 --> 02:35.989
Rollins?

02:36.023 --> 02:37.024
Are you crying?

02:37.057 --> 02:38.359
- No, I'm not.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.594
- Oh, you are so busted.

02:40.628 --> 02:44.632
- And what happened when you
got back to the triplex?

02:45.633 --> 02:47.368
Let's take a look.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.702
- Hey.

02:48.736 --> 02:49.703
Look who's back.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.104
- Oh, hey.

02:51.138 --> 02:52.273
- Oh, yeah.

02:52.306 --> 02:53.441
[laughter]

02:53.474 --> 02:56.410
- Hey!
You guys look happy.

02:56.444 --> 02:59.012
- Graham made mojitos.
You want one?

02:59.046 --> 03:00.848
- Uh, we--we're good, thanks.

03:00.881 --> 03:03.016
- Yeah.

03:03.050 --> 03:04.285
- Hey.

03:04.318 --> 03:09.257
So John slipped me
the Dream Suite key.

03:09.257 --> 03:10.591
[dance music plays]

03:10.624 --> 03:11.592
It's ours if we want it.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.394
- I'm dizzy and--

03:13.427 --> 03:15.263
[giggles]

- Oh.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.372
*

03:24.405 --> 03:26.874
- I'm not sure about this.

03:26.907 --> 03:34.915
*

03:38.286 --> 03:39.287
You're a good guy.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.289
- Yeah?

03:41.289 --> 03:42.956
- And a sexy guy.

03:42.990 --> 03:46.794
[cheers and applause]

03:46.827 --> 03:49.597
- Wow, I--that's a beg step
for you, Melanie.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.765
- Oh, it wasn't
that big of a step.

03:51.799 --> 03:54.001
- Are you sure?

03:54.034 --> 03:57.871
Let's see what happened
a little later in the evening.

03:59.006 --> 04:02.209
[audience gasps, cheers]

04:02.310 --> 04:03.377
[dramatic music]

04:03.411 --> 04:05.846
- Oh, whoa.
- Wow.

04:05.879 --> 04:09.650
- Wait, I-I don't remember
any of this.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.084
- Well, you--you do remember

04:11.118 --> 04:13.020
going to the Dream Suite
with Ryan, don't you?

04:13.053 --> 04:14.722
- Yes, but I'm a virgin.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.991
I would never
have slept with him.

04:18.025 --> 04:19.727
- Cut.
Cut.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.728
John, commercial now.

04:20.761 --> 04:21.729
Go.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.196
- Did Ryan rape me?

04:23.230 --> 04:24.565
- And, uh, we'll be back.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.567
*

04:26.600 --> 04:27.568
- Did you see what I just saw?

04:27.601 --> 04:30.504
- And she wasn't acting.

04:30.538 --> 04:32.673
Did they just air a rape?

04:32.706 --> 04:36.544
*

04:38.412 --> 04:41.382
[dramatic music]

04:41.415 --> 04:49.423
*

05:24.425 --> 05:24.558
.

05:26.093 --> 05:26.460
- I'm a virgin.

05:27.728 --> 05:28.862
I-I would never have
slept with him.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.464
Did Ryan rape me?

05:30.498 --> 05:32.566
- And, uh, we'll be back.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.469
- So this mating game aired
last night live?

05:35.503 --> 05:37.037
- In front of 10 million people.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.672
- Yeah, lock 20-year-olds up
together.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.307
Liquor them up.

05:40.408 --> 05:41.842
I mean, I'm surprised this
hasn't happened before.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.243
- Carisi, don't tell me
you watch this show.

05:43.276 --> 05:44.412
- Uh, no.

05:44.412 --> 05:45.679
Actually, last night
was my first time.

05:45.713 --> 05:46.680
I was making dinner.

05:46.714 --> 05:47.748
Rollins put it on.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.683
- Oh, you were making dinner?

05:49.717 --> 05:51.719
Maybe you guys were distracted,

05:51.752 --> 05:53.554
but uh,
reality shows are all fake.

05:53.587 --> 05:54.755
You know that, right?

05:54.788 --> 05:56.424
- Not last night.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.058
They want drama.
They want fairytales.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.760
They don't want rape,
and you saw,

05:59.793 --> 06:01.662
they cut away as soon as Melanie
started to freak out.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.296
- Did she report it?

06:03.330 --> 06:05.433
- Who knows if the producers
let her make a call?

06:05.466 --> 06:08.068
They don't allow access
to the outside world.

06:08.101 --> 06:10.070
- Yeah,
it's like Stockholm Syndrome.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.605
I mean,
with all these headlines,

06:11.639 --> 06:13.441
plus the amount of calls we're
getting from concerned viewers,

06:13.441 --> 06:15.075
including the Chief of D's
wife--

06:15.108 --> 06:16.810
- We should at least just go
and ask a few questions.

06:16.844 --> 06:19.647
- Okay,
so go talk to Melanie,

06:19.680 --> 06:23.150
but I'm interested
in our reality, not theirs.

06:26.019 --> 06:28.989
[dance music playing]

06:29.022 --> 06:30.924
*

06:30.958 --> 06:33.360
- Whoa, there's the hot tub that
Ashley B slapped Graham in

06:33.461 --> 06:35.362
in the second episode.

06:35.463 --> 06:37.264
Did you see that?
- Huh?

06:37.297 --> 06:38.599
- Hi there.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.634
Lizzie Bauer,
co-producer.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.503
How can I help the NYPD?

06:42.536 --> 06:44.538
- Well, we're following up on
the accusation Melanie made

06:44.572 --> 06:45.606
on the air last night.

06:45.639 --> 06:46.940
- Of course.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.108
We've been getting calls
about it too,

06:48.141 --> 06:49.477
but you know nothing happened,
right?

06:49.477 --> 06:51.178
Our show is
heavily scripted.

06:51.211 --> 06:53.213
- Okay, well, we still need
to speak to Melanie.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.716
- Um, our executive producers
are talking to the network.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.652
Can I ask you to wait
until they get here?

06:58.686 --> 07:00.888
- No.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.023
- Melanie's close
to the final round.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.391
I-I talked to her last night.

07:04.492 --> 07:06.059
If she'd wanted
the police involved,

07:06.093 --> 07:08.061
we definitely would
have made that happen.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.963
- We need to hear that
from her.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.131
- Uh-huh.

07:11.164 --> 07:14.835
*

07:17.337 --> 07:19.206
Hey, Melanie?

07:19.239 --> 07:21.141
These detectives
are from SVU.

07:21.174 --> 07:23.711
They're concerned
about what you said last night.

07:23.744 --> 07:24.945
I told them that it was
just part of the show,

07:24.978 --> 07:26.379
that you're fine.

07:26.413 --> 07:29.149
- Let her tell us that.

07:29.182 --> 07:30.784
Melanie, can we ask you
a few questions?

07:30.818 --> 07:33.286
- Um, I guess so.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.388
- Give us the room, please?

07:35.422 --> 07:37.825
- Oh.
Okay.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.861
I will be right outside
when you're done.

07:42.362 --> 07:44.097
[door closes]

07:44.131 --> 07:45.232
- Hey.

07:45.265 --> 07:46.233
We were watching
last night.

07:46.266 --> 07:49.069
That looked...tough.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.437
How you doing?

07:50.538 --> 07:51.939
- I don't know.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.974
Um, it's hard to know
what you're thinking

07:54.007 --> 07:58.546
with everybody always
watching and filming.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.383
- Okay, you all have privacy
in the bathroom?

08:03.416 --> 08:06.353
All right.

08:06.386 --> 08:09.557
- All I know is,
I don't remember having sex.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.559
I would never have
agreed to that.

08:11.559 --> 08:13.360
- But you think
you did have sex?

08:13.393 --> 08:17.397
- Well, after seeing the video,
it kind of made sense.

08:17.430 --> 08:20.934
Morning after my date,
I was sore down there.

08:20.968 --> 08:23.837
My panties were on the floor.

08:23.871 --> 08:28.341
I felt...different.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.911
- Did you tell anybody?

08:30.944 --> 08:34.447
- I didn't remember it,
so I didn't say anything.

08:34.481 --> 08:38.418
- Okay, well, Melanie,
um...if you were--

08:38.451 --> 08:42.690
if you were unable to consent,
yeah, that could be rape.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.592
- Well,
they said that it wasn't.

08:44.592 --> 08:46.694
- Who's they?

08:46.727 --> 08:47.695
- Lizzie.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.462
And the Princes,

08:49.496 --> 08:53.934
Jeffrey and Regina Prince,
the executive producers.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.269
They said that
since I told Ryan

08:56.303 --> 08:59.239
that I wanted to lose my
virginity to him eventually,

08:59.272 --> 09:01.374
that I must have wanted it.

09:01.408 --> 09:02.475
- No.
No.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.311
They were wrong,
all right?

09:04.344 --> 09:05.512
It doesn't matter what you did

09:05.613 --> 09:07.781
or what you said before.

09:07.815 --> 09:10.017
[dramatic music]

09:10.050 --> 09:12.620
- Th--then I don't--

09:12.653 --> 09:15.188
I don't understand.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.891
I thought that Ryan and I were
in love with each other.

09:17.925 --> 09:19.993
Why...

09:20.027 --> 09:22.663
why would he rape me?

09:22.696 --> 09:24.164
- We can investigate.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.466
We can talk to Ryan
and collect evidence.

09:26.499 --> 09:27.801
Do you have any clothing
from that night?

09:27.835 --> 09:30.904
- They take care of
our laundry here.

09:30.938 --> 09:34.141
They take care
of everything.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.644
Could I borrow your cell?

09:36.677 --> 09:39.847
We're not allowed phones,
and I want to call my mom.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.749
- Of course.

09:41.782 --> 09:46.186
*

09:46.219 --> 09:47.688
- So sorry you had
to waste a trip.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.322
- No, not really.

09:49.356 --> 09:50.691
Detective Rollins is going to
take Melanie to the hospital

09:50.724 --> 09:52.025
to get a rape kit done.

09:52.059 --> 09:53.493
- No--wait,
Melanie can't go.

09:53.526 --> 09:54.862
She has a shoot.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.329
The ladies dine and dish.
- Does she?

09:56.363 --> 09:58.666
That mean that the guys aren't
working then, right?

09:58.699 --> 10:00.300
That's good, because I need
to talk to Ryan.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.069
- Hang on.
This is a closed set.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.004
- No, not anymore,
it's not.

10:04.037 --> 10:08.175
- Lizzie, they want you to stir
things up before we shoot.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.877
Wait, so it's true?

10:09.910 --> 10:10.878
There are cops here?

10:10.911 --> 10:12.179
- John Valentine.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.213
You were with Melanie
last night

10:13.246 --> 10:14.682
when she watched that video?

10:14.715 --> 10:16.183
To me it looked like she was
genuinely surprised.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.918
- Let me give you
lesson number one

10:17.951 --> 10:20.587
from the John Valentine
school of reality hosting:

10:20.620 --> 10:21.588
you stand on your mark,

10:21.621 --> 10:23.390
you say the words,

10:23.423 --> 10:26.126
you get paid, that's it.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.394
- Thank you, John.

10:27.427 --> 10:28.962
The detectives are here
on official police business.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.430
- Come on, Lizzie.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.299
About Melanie crying rape?

10:32.332 --> 10:34.668
Please, she signed a waiver.
- [huffs]

10:34.702 --> 10:37.938
- Lesson number two:
if it's a reality show,

10:37.971 --> 10:40.473
there is no reality.

10:41.809 --> 10:44.077
- All right,
so do we just start?

10:44.111 --> 10:46.079
- This isn't part
of the show, Ryan.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.115
- Right, sorry.
We're in a bubble here.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.350
- Listen, we want to talk to you

10:50.383 --> 10:51.351
about your date with Melanie,

10:51.384 --> 10:53.586
your time in the Dream Suite.

10:53.620 --> 10:55.022
- I don't like to
kiss and tell.

10:55.055 --> 10:58.158
- 10 million people
saw that video.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.060
- Okay.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.830
She gave me her virginity.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.933
- All right,
so you had sex with her.

11:05.966 --> 11:08.068
You want to give us
any specifics?

11:08.101 --> 11:10.838
- It was magical.
Our hearts' desire.

11:10.871 --> 11:14.241
- That's not what she's saying.

11:14.274 --> 11:17.177
- Wait, is this about Melanie's
freak-out on the live show?

11:17.210 --> 11:20.113
'Cause whatever she said,
that--it was part of the script.

11:20.147 --> 11:22.215
- No, it wasn't.
We just spoke to her.

11:22.249 --> 11:24.351
She doesn't remember
having sex.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.353
She said she was unconscious.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.188
- I...

11:28.221 --> 11:30.090
look, look, you need to talk
to the producers

11:30.123 --> 11:33.193
'cause they must have told her
to say that, too.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.327
We don't say anything

11:34.361 --> 11:36.329
unless we've cleared it
with them first.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.332
[dramatic music]

11:39.366 --> 11:40.768
- So Melanie agreed
to a rape kit

11:40.801 --> 11:42.102
but she has no memory

11:42.135 --> 11:44.437
of consenting to
or even having sex?

11:44.471 --> 11:45.973
- No, no, but Ryan does.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.776
- He claims it was consensual.
- And magical.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.643
- Okay, are you sure that
this isn't part of the show?

11:50.677 --> 11:52.212
- Yeah, look,
something happened to this girl

11:52.245 --> 11:53.781
that she did not want
to have happen.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.582
- Uh, these are
our executive producers.

11:55.615 --> 11:56.950
- Jeff Prince.
- Hey.

11:56.984 --> 11:59.219
- My wife, Regina.
We rushed in from Wainscott

11:59.252 --> 12:00.888
as soon as Lizzie told us
you were here.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.823
- Okay, and,
Lieutenant Benson,

12:02.856 --> 12:04.858
now you're aware that we're
investigating a rape allegation?

12:04.892 --> 12:06.960
- Aware and appalled.

12:06.994 --> 12:10.831
Our show is
about love, romance.

12:10.864 --> 12:14.401
This accusation
is deeply disturbing.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.136
- We tell the bachelors
to treat every young lady

12:16.169 --> 12:17.905
as if she's our daughter.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.807
- You have a daughter?
- No, we don't have children.

12:19.807 --> 12:23.576
The point is, these girls need
to be respected and protected.

12:23.610 --> 12:26.079
- Okay, well, Melanie
doesn't feel like she was.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.480
- Believe me,
if there was any indication

12:27.514 --> 12:29.249
that something had happened
against her will,

12:29.282 --> 12:30.717
we wouldn't have gone
with it.

12:30.818 --> 12:32.019
- So you're saying
it was consensual?

12:32.052 --> 12:33.053
- Well...

12:33.086 --> 12:34.421
- Melanie has been trying

12:34.454 --> 12:36.489
to connect with Ryan
for weeks, you know.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.325
Maybe having the audience
find out

12:38.358 --> 12:40.027
that she had lost
her virginity...

12:40.060 --> 12:41.594
- Was so mortifying

12:41.628 --> 12:45.232
that she tried to project her
self-loathing onto Ryan.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.600
Look, Melanie's so...

12:47.634 --> 12:49.202
Melanie's mercurial.

12:49.236 --> 12:50.403
both: Sensitive.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.072
- Makes for good drama, but--

12:52.105 --> 12:53.941
- Yeah, but until
she veers off-script.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.708
- Yeah.
- But she told my detectives

12:55.742 --> 12:59.412
that she has no memory
of consenting.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.014
- Well,
she never mentioned that

13:01.048 --> 13:02.482
when Lizzie talked to her
the morning after.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.284
- Like I said,
she's a small-town girl.

13:04.317 --> 13:05.318
Her parents were watching.

13:05.352 --> 13:06.519
She panicked.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.588
Oh, no, maybe she got wind
of the fact

13:08.621 --> 13:11.591
that Ryan was--Ryan was
going to pick Gigi.

13:11.624 --> 13:16.096
- Girl cries rape,
game clock is on hold.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.330
Is somebody
writing this down?

13:17.364 --> 13:19.867
Lizzie.
- Wait, wait, wait, stop.

13:19.867 --> 13:22.435
All right, you're saying that
Melanie cried rape

13:22.469 --> 13:25.005
because she didn't want Ryan
to go with Gigi?

13:28.208 --> 13:30.010
- Jeffrey,
we have to show them.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.244
- [sighs]

13:31.278 --> 13:33.246
The network lawyers told us
to give you nothing

13:33.280 --> 13:34.381
without a warrant,

13:34.414 --> 13:37.117
but you should see
her morning-after interview.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.218
Come on.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.420
- We're stepping in.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.291
Hey, come on.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.725
- We call it an OTF.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.294
both: On the fly.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.196
- You know, to get
their immediate reactions.

13:49.229 --> 13:52.232
This one didn't make it to air
because, well,

13:52.265 --> 13:54.534
frankly, it's boring.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.169
- How are you feeling
this morning, Melanie?

13:56.203 --> 13:59.739
- Oh, I woke up
on top of the world.

13:59.772 --> 14:01.374
So happy.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.243
- So last night
was a dream come true?

14:03.276 --> 14:04.411
- Yeah.

14:04.444 --> 14:05.979
I mean, dates like last night

14:06.013 --> 14:08.715
are what makes
fighting for Ryan

14:08.748 --> 14:10.317
and this whole

14:10.350 --> 14:13.786
"Heart's Desire" process
worth it.

14:13.820 --> 14:15.956
- Uh-huh.

14:15.989 --> 14:18.725
Gigi looked pretty upset
when you went off with him,

14:18.758 --> 14:21.494
but talk to me about that.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.931
- Ah, Lizzie.
I mean, come on.

14:23.931 --> 14:26.934
I-I don't kiss and tell.

14:26.934 --> 14:29.436
- Now,
you know I have to ask.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.571
- Okay, well, um...

14:31.604 --> 14:36.176
Ryan was a complete gentleman
the whole night.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.012
That's what made it
so special.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.348
He could be the one.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.984
I think we're falling in love.

14:44.017 --> 14:46.853
- Her own words.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.488
If we can help you
with anything else--

14:48.521 --> 14:51.024
- Anything at all,
just ask.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.260
[tense music]

14:53.293 --> 14:55.795
- Okay.
Thank you.

15:06.006 --> 15:06.139
.

15:07.840 --> 15:08.641
- I said Ryan was
a perfect gentleman

15:09.876 --> 15:11.144
before I realized
that he had sex with me,

15:11.178 --> 15:12.779
but I'm not making this up.

15:12.812 --> 15:15.048
- We believe you.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.383
The rape kit found traces

15:16.416 --> 15:19.352
of condom lubricant, so--

15:19.386 --> 15:21.621
- Oh, my God.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.094
So I'm...

15:27.127 --> 15:30.130
I'm not a virgin anymore.

15:31.898 --> 15:33.633
I can't go back
to that house.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.235
- Okay, well, we need you
to stay in the city

15:35.268 --> 15:37.237
until we finish
this investigation,

15:37.270 --> 15:39.239
but we're happy to
put you up in a hotel.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.575
- The Princes are already
taking care of that.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.011
You saw them at the hospital.

15:44.011 --> 15:45.578
They're being
really understanding

15:45.612 --> 15:47.314
about all of this.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.349
- Yes, they are.

15:50.817 --> 15:51.884
- This girl didn't
realize she was raped

15:51.918 --> 15:53.253
until she saw it
on live TV?

15:53.286 --> 15:54.787
- I know, I know.

15:54.821 --> 15:56.123
- I get the she said.
What's the he said?

15:56.156 --> 15:58.225
- Ryan Ledder claims
that it was consensual.

15:58.258 --> 15:59.626
- And the footage shows what?

15:59.659 --> 16:00.727
Can you tell
if she's conscious or not?

16:00.760 --> 16:02.029
- Not really.

16:02.029 --> 16:03.363
All we have
is what was broadcast.

16:03.396 --> 16:04.664
There's, you know,

16:04.697 --> 16:06.533
night camera movement,
no audio,

16:06.566 --> 16:07.534
and the lawyers
are dragging their feet

16:07.567 --> 16:09.036
about the raw footage.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.837
- I'll get you a warrant
to clone the servers

16:10.870 --> 16:12.739
and a grand jury subpoena for
all the audio and video records

16:12.772 --> 16:14.041
from over the weekend.

16:14.074 --> 16:15.375
My mother watches the show.

16:15.408 --> 16:16.909
She says they film
every minute.

16:16.943 --> 16:18.578
- So there's got to be
continuous recording

16:18.611 --> 16:20.147
of what led up to the sex.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.314
That should
tell us something.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.316
- Or not.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.052
- Ryan is here.

16:25.052 --> 16:26.553
- We didn't ask
to talk to him.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.088
- He wants to talk to us.
So does his mother.

16:28.121 --> 16:31.191
She's a divorce lawyer.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.359
- How noble.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.327
I'll get you those warrants.

16:34.361 --> 16:35.528
- I called the show

16:35.562 --> 16:36.596
the second I saw
what had happened.

16:36.629 --> 16:37.897
Now, the producers assured me

16:37.930 --> 16:39.266
there was nothing
to worry about.

16:39.299 --> 16:40.833
- They didn't even tell me
that she called.

16:40.867 --> 16:44.337
- Then I see the headlines
accusing my son of rape?

16:44.371 --> 16:45.605
I got on the first plane

16:45.638 --> 16:47.074
and I yanked him
the hell out of there.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.675
- Okay, Mrs. Ledder,
I appreciate your concern,

16:48.708 --> 16:51.078
but your son is being
investigated for sexual assault.

16:51.078 --> 16:53.113
- Well, that's why we're here.

16:53.146 --> 16:54.781
Tell them, Ryan.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.183
Tell them what you told me.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.585
- Okay, I lied to you
this morning.

16:58.618 --> 17:01.254
Mel and I,
we didn't have sex.

17:01.288 --> 17:02.522
- So that wasn't you
in the Dream Suite?

17:02.555 --> 17:03.990
- It was me, at first.

17:04.091 --> 17:05.958
We had a lot of champagne,
she kissed me,

17:05.992 --> 17:08.095
then she whispered
in my ear that...

17:08.128 --> 17:09.096
[sighs]

17:09.129 --> 17:10.263
Once we were married,

17:10.297 --> 17:12.099
she would give me
her most precious gift.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.966
It...it freaked me out.

17:14.000 --> 17:14.967
It was too much pressure.

17:15.001 --> 17:16.369
I got out of there.

17:16.403 --> 17:18.438
- So why didn't you
just say that?

17:18.471 --> 17:20.307
- Come on, I was trying
to stay on the show.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.342
The producers told me
that Melanie and I,

17:22.375 --> 17:24.477
we had a real shot
at the finale.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.113
That would be huge
for both of us.

17:26.113 --> 17:28.315
- I told him not to do
this ridiculous show.

17:28.348 --> 17:29.549
I mean, come on.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.651
They will do anything
for ratings.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.353
- The thing is, Ryan,

17:33.386 --> 17:37.124
is Melanie's rape kit
confirmed sexual activity.

17:37.157 --> 17:39.292
There were abrasions,
condom lubricant residue.

17:39.326 --> 17:40.293
- That's impossible.

17:40.327 --> 17:41.728
- Whoa, whoa, lubricant?

17:41.761 --> 17:43.130
Can you tell the brand?
- Mom!

17:43.163 --> 17:47.534
- Uh, yes, actually,
it was, uh, Sultan Ecstasy.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.535
- Use those, Ryan?

17:48.568 --> 17:49.769
- Yeah, but we all do.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.138
There's bowls of them
all over the house.

17:51.138 --> 17:54.741
Look, someone else must have
come in after I left, all right?

17:54.774 --> 17:56.743
There's a lot
that they leave out.

17:56.776 --> 17:57.944
- Bottom line,

17:57.977 --> 18:00.147
whoever deflowered
Sleeping Beauty,

18:00.147 --> 18:02.149
it wasn't my son.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.550
[tense music]

18:03.583 --> 18:05.152
- We've been in crisis mode
all day.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.920
Network lawyers, the studio,
Ryan's mother,

18:07.954 --> 18:09.322
now this warrant
from your DA.

18:09.356 --> 18:10.823
- Did you manipulate
the footage last night?

18:10.857 --> 18:12.159
- You mean, did we edit it?
Yes.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.893
- Well,
did Ryan happen to tell you

18:13.926 --> 18:16.163
that he freaked out and left
Melanie in the Dream Suite?

18:16.163 --> 18:18.265
- Well, yes,
but when we went through

18:18.298 --> 18:19.799
the nighttime
motion-activated footage,

18:19.832 --> 18:21.468
somebody was in bed with her.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.936
- So you let the audience
and Melanie believe it was Ryan?

18:23.970 --> 18:25.272
- We thought maybe
he changed his mind.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.273
He had a drink.
He came back in.

18:26.306 --> 18:27.507
It happens all the time.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.975
- Well, did you ask him
about that?

18:29.008 --> 18:30.677
- Do you have any idea
what reality TV is like?

18:30.710 --> 18:32.078
Non-union crew
working 19-hour days

18:32.179 --> 18:33.746
with a cast
of rum-drunk 20-somethings

18:33.780 --> 18:35.982
who've all been locked in
together for weeks.

18:36.015 --> 18:37.584
It is a miracle we get
a show on every Mond--

18:37.617 --> 18:39.319
- Okay, we need to see
that footage, please.

18:39.352 --> 18:40.887
- Yes.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.290
Visitors here.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.824
- Officers, I, uh...

18:44.857 --> 18:46.493
I wish you were here
under better circumstances.

18:46.526 --> 18:47.527
- We're here with a warrant.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.529
- Um, yeah, we were informed.

18:49.562 --> 18:52.299
We've just been going over all
of the footage from that night.

18:52.332 --> 18:53.866
We did miss something.

18:53.900 --> 18:57.103
- Did you miss something
or were you covering it up?

18:57.204 --> 18:58.805
- Explain, Lizzie.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.106
- After the crew is sent home,

19:00.207 --> 19:01.608
everything is shot
from security cameras.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.109
They're motion-activated,

19:03.210 --> 19:06.213
and sometimes it takes them
a while to wake up.

19:06.213 --> 19:09.081
- Uh, here's what we've,
uh, reconstructed.

19:09.115 --> 19:10.082
- You're a good guy.

19:10.116 --> 19:11.551
- Yeah?

19:11.584 --> 19:13.085
- And a sexy guy.

19:13.119 --> 19:14.221
- That's what actually aired.

19:14.221 --> 19:16.389
Stan, fast forward.

19:25.432 --> 19:27.634
Okay, hit play.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.969
- You do know
that I'm a virgin.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.339
- Yeah.

19:34.974 --> 19:36.142
- But if you want
to spend the night,

19:36.243 --> 19:38.778
we can cuddle.

19:38.811 --> 19:42.114
I know that
you're the one for me,

19:42.148 --> 19:43.650
and when we're married,

19:43.683 --> 19:47.487
I'll give you
my most precious gift.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.257
- I, um...

19:50.257 --> 19:54.160
I think we should
call it a night.

19:54.261 --> 19:56.429
It's been great, though.

19:56.463 --> 19:57.964
- I love you, Ryan.

19:57.997 --> 19:59.266
- Fast forward.

19:59.299 --> 20:03.102
[suspenseful music]

20:03.135 --> 20:04.637
You can see why
we didn't air any of that.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.105
It wasn't good
for the narrative.

20:06.138 --> 20:07.740
- Hold on.

20:07.774 --> 20:10.943
So the nightcam footage
that shows them having sex,

20:10.977 --> 20:12.345
what was that?

20:12.379 --> 20:14.247
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

20:14.281 --> 20:16.749
- I assumed it was Ryan.
I didn't see it.

20:16.783 --> 20:19.819
- We realize now after talking
with Ryan and his mother

20:19.852 --> 20:21.954
and double-checking
the time code,

20:21.988 --> 20:23.222
that it wasn't him.

20:23.256 --> 20:24.924
- Whoever it was,
you've got footage of them

20:24.957 --> 20:27.327
going into the Dream Suite
and getting into Melanie's bed.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.329
- No, we're still going
through all the raw footage.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.764
- Our techs will handle that,
thank you.

20:31.798 --> 20:32.999
Uh, in the meantime,

20:33.032 --> 20:34.434
we'll need to speak
with everyone

20:34.467 --> 20:37.604
who was working Saturday night,
off camera.

20:37.637 --> 20:40.307
- Absolutely, absolutely.

20:40.340 --> 20:43.175
- Okay, everybody please,
listen up.

20:43.209 --> 20:46.513
The NYPD are here to investigate
the heinous accusation

20:46.546 --> 20:48.781
that Melanie made on air
last night.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.717
- Oh, my God,
so this is real?

20:50.750 --> 20:53.320
- We don't know,
but the show is now on hold.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.821
Production's shut down.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.222
- Wait, wait, what?

20:56.255 --> 20:57.857
So it's true.
Melanie was raped.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.225
- Don't look at me.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.127
I was with Ashley S
all night long.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.962
Girl almost killed me.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.897
- Emmett, not now.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.133
- Everyone is presumed innocent.

21:07.166 --> 21:08.801
- Where are Ryan and Melanie?
- Are they off the show?

21:08.835 --> 21:10.403
- They're fine.

21:10.437 --> 21:13.406
Uh, we have them staying
in separate hotels for now.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.241
But for your safety,

21:15.342 --> 21:18.110
the house security cams
will remain on at all times.

21:18.144 --> 21:19.946
- And in the meantime,
no one leaves the house.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.415
As soon as this is resolved,
we'll resume filming.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.884
- We're only two episodes away
from our finale, people.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.619
We've come this far together.

21:26.653 --> 21:27.920
- How long do we
just sit around for?

21:27.954 --> 21:30.089
- Until our investigation
is over.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.358
My squad and I will interview

21:31.358 --> 21:32.759
each and every one of you.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.394
- And we expect you
to cooperate fully.

21:34.427 --> 21:35.828
We're taking this
very seriously.

21:35.862 --> 21:38.064
If you saw something...

21:38.097 --> 21:40.900
both: Say something.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.935
- How did Melanie seem
to you Saturday night?

21:42.969 --> 21:45.838
- She was def drunk,
but she was into Ryan,

21:45.872 --> 21:48.375
so I don't know
why she's crying rape now.

21:48.375 --> 21:49.676
- So you think she's lying?

21:49.709 --> 21:51.378
- I don't know.

21:51.378 --> 21:54.381
Maybe the producers
set her up or something.

21:54.414 --> 21:55.648
*

21:55.682 --> 21:57.817
- I saw Ryan leading Melanie
to the Dream Suite.

21:57.850 --> 21:58.918
He was all over her.

21:58.951 --> 22:00.086
I thought if those two hook up,

22:00.119 --> 22:01.688
I better hook up
with somebody fast,

22:01.721 --> 22:04.223
so I made my move
on Ashley B.

22:04.256 --> 22:05.257
- How'd that work out?

22:05.291 --> 22:06.759
- Friendzoned.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.395
She said she liked me,
but not like that,

22:08.428 --> 22:11.230
so I finished a pitcher
of mojitos and passed out.

22:11.263 --> 22:14.000
- So Graham,
remember what time it was?

22:14.033 --> 22:15.267
- Uh, after midnight?

22:15.301 --> 22:17.069
The crew was gone,

22:17.103 --> 22:19.406
and if Ryan left the suite
it must have been after that.

22:19.406 --> 22:21.007
- Whoever raped her
was not Ryan.

22:21.040 --> 22:24.777
I know because him and I
spent the night together.

22:24.811 --> 22:25.845
- He came to your room?

22:25.878 --> 22:27.614
- No, I went to his

22:27.647 --> 22:30.950
after Lizzie told me him
and Melanie hadn't worked out.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.084
*

22:32.118 --> 22:33.420
- Lizzie told you that?

22:33.453 --> 22:35.054
- Yeah, I was in the hot tub.

22:35.087 --> 22:36.923
Ashley S and Emmett
had already hooked up.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.458
There was no way
I was about to do Graham.

22:38.491 --> 22:40.427
I thought I was
off the show.

22:40.427 --> 22:42.028
- And that's when Lizzie
came to you?

22:42.061 --> 22:44.731
- Mm-hmm, she told me
that Melanie just wanted

22:44.764 --> 22:46.032
to cuddle with Ryan,

22:46.065 --> 22:48.968
that he left the Dream Suite
unsatisfied.

22:49.001 --> 22:50.937
She told me to take my shot.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.640
- Okay...did they film
any of this?

22:53.673 --> 22:56.042
- No, they don't film
what the producers tell us.

22:56.075 --> 22:57.710
They wind us up and then
they turn the cameras on.

22:57.744 --> 22:58.878
- All right, okay,
so she wound you up.

22:58.911 --> 22:59.879
What did you do?

22:59.912 --> 23:01.213
- I took my shot.

23:01.247 --> 23:03.450
I toweled off,
I found Ryan at the bar,

23:03.483 --> 23:05.317
and we went straight
to his room.

23:05.351 --> 23:07.186
I told him I would do
anything he wanted,

23:07.219 --> 23:08.821
and I did.

23:08.855 --> 23:12.625
It wasn't the Dream Suite,
but I blew his...

23:12.659 --> 23:13.993
mind.

23:14.026 --> 23:15.294
- They didn't put that
on the show?

23:15.327 --> 23:16.796
- They told us
they were going to.

23:16.829 --> 23:18.197
They'd interviewed me
and Ryan about it.

23:18.230 --> 23:23.135
It was gonna be
the big surprise twist.

23:23.169 --> 23:25.337
Maybe they told
Melanie that,

23:25.371 --> 23:27.339
and that's why
she cried rape,

23:27.373 --> 23:29.642
so it could be
all about her.

23:29.676 --> 23:30.877
- Gigi's a liar.

23:30.910 --> 23:31.978
It's a major plot line.

23:32.011 --> 23:33.012
Nobody likes her.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.481
- Well, she says Ryan does.

23:34.481 --> 23:35.715
She told me that
they hooked up last night.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.884
both: Oh, please.

23:37.917 --> 23:41.053
- She's hooked up with
everybody, including Ashley B.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.555
Did she tell you that?

23:42.589 --> 23:44.390
- Well, she said that
this was all on film,

23:44.491 --> 23:47.393
that she and Ryan were
supposed to be the big reveal

23:47.494 --> 23:48.928
at the end of the live show.

23:48.961 --> 23:52.398
- Okay, okay, we may have
let her think that.

23:52.499 --> 23:54.200
We keep as many balls in the air
as we can,

23:54.233 --> 23:57.504
but the whole point is to
surprise them live on camera.

23:57.537 --> 24:00.206
- Uh, we--we have a situation.

24:00.239 --> 24:01.841
- Yeah,
that's gonna have to wait.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.510
- Melanie's here,
she's looking for Ryan.

24:03.510 --> 24:04.744
I didn't know
what to tell her.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.145
- Where is she?
- The lounge.

24:06.178 --> 24:09.516
- Cue cameras
six, seven, and eight.

24:09.516 --> 24:11.651
- Where is he?
Where the hell is Ryan?

24:11.684 --> 24:14.587
- Melanie, what's wrong?
- Got an STD from my rapist.

24:14.621 --> 24:16.288
- Oh, geez.
- Oh.

24:16.322 --> 24:17.990
- I should go in there.
- Absolutely not.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.659
- John, you go.
- No, everybody stays here.

24:19.692 --> 24:21.594
Fin, Carisi,
to the lounge now.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.029
- Hey, hey, whoa!
- Stop!

24:23.062 --> 24:26.999
[all yelling at once]

24:32.572 --> 24:32.705
.

24:34.206 --> 24:34.907
- He raped me!
- Oh, he raped you?

24:36.543 --> 24:37.744
- You're all just going to do
what they say after that?

24:37.777 --> 24:39.278
- Don't you ever in your life--
- Go to hell!

24:39.311 --> 24:40.379
[all bickering]

24:40.412 --> 24:42.214
- Hey, hey, break it up.

24:42.248 --> 24:44.116
- Stop! Now.
Stop.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.351
- She started it.

24:45.384 --> 24:46.819
- Shut up, you did.
You start everything.

24:46.853 --> 24:48.555
- Hey,
I don't care who started it.

24:48.555 --> 24:49.556
It's over.
Now.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.057
- Okay, Graham.
Emmett.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.692
You two, come with me.

24:52.725 --> 24:54.561
- I didn't do anything.
- Okay, be quiet, sit down.

24:54.561 --> 24:56.128
All three of you, come on.

24:56.162 --> 24:58.731
- Melanie, why don't you
come with us, please?

24:58.765 --> 25:01.568
- So we saw
on the security footage.

25:01.568 --> 25:03.603
You got an STD?

25:03.636 --> 25:05.204
- From Ryan.
Chlamydia.

25:05.237 --> 25:06.606
Where is he?

25:06.639 --> 25:07.707
- His mother took him
out of the house,

25:07.740 --> 25:09.208
but Melanie,
you should know

25:09.241 --> 25:11.644
that he may not be the one
who assaulted you.

25:11.678 --> 25:13.312
- What?
- Well, the timeline is off.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.047
There's footage of him
leaving the Dream Suite

25:15.081 --> 25:17.884
before the nightcam video
that aired.

25:17.917 --> 25:19.151
[footsteps approaching]

25:19.185 --> 25:21.453
- Okay, folks,
everybody calm down.

25:21.487 --> 25:23.389
We're on the same team.
Let's stick together.

25:23.422 --> 25:24.957
- Okay,
your show is over.

25:24.991 --> 25:26.793
This is a police investigation.

25:26.826 --> 25:29.729
- We're all on the same page.
Everything's kosh.

25:29.762 --> 25:30.997
- I want the cameras off now.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.165
- Uh, Lizzie, you heard her.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.500
- Kill cameras
six, seven, and eight.

25:34.601 --> 25:36.903
- All of them.
- Kill all of them.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.470
- Thank you.

25:38.504 --> 25:40.973
Now, do you test
your contestants for STDs

25:41.007 --> 25:42.174
before they're allowed
on the show?

25:42.208 --> 25:43.475
- Of course we do.

25:43.509 --> 25:45.812
We do psych profiles,
background checks.

25:45.845 --> 25:49.048
- We carefully vet every
potential cast member,

25:49.081 --> 25:50.416
the crew included.

25:50.449 --> 25:52.852
- Great, I'm gonna need to see
all those records.

25:52.885 --> 25:55.221
- Of course.
- Lizzie, come on.

25:55.254 --> 25:56.756
- Thank you.

25:56.789 --> 25:57.990
- So there were nine men
in the house that night?

25:58.024 --> 25:59.726
- Yes, but the crew left
at midnight,

25:59.759 --> 26:01.160
and from the time code,

26:01.193 --> 26:02.528
Melanie's assault happened
after that.

26:02.629 --> 26:04.163
- Yeah, and all the crew guys
had alibis.

26:04.196 --> 26:05.397
We confirmed
that they were drinking

26:05.431 --> 26:07.333
at a nearby hotel bar
until last call.

26:07.366 --> 26:08.334
- Test them all
for STDs anyway.

26:08.367 --> 26:09.636
- Yeah, we did.

26:09.669 --> 26:11.070
Along with
all three bachelors.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.672
- The lab results
aren't back yet.

26:12.705 --> 26:15.207
So everybody's still sequestered
in this triplex?

26:15.241 --> 26:16.809
- We got unis posted
out front.

26:16.843 --> 26:17.844
I don't trust
these producers.

26:17.877 --> 26:19.511
- Oh, speaking of which,

26:19.545 --> 26:21.413
where are we
with the TARU raw footage?

26:21.447 --> 26:22.982
- They cloned
their entire server.

26:23.015 --> 26:25.251
- So far
after Ryan leaves at midnight,

26:25.284 --> 26:26.552
we have no video of anyone

26:26.653 --> 26:28.721
going in or out
of that Dream Suite.

26:28.755 --> 26:30.556
- But there is video of someone

26:30.657 --> 26:31.891
in bed with Melanie
at 2:00 a.m.?

26:31.924 --> 26:34.727
- Right, so either
we're dealing with a ghost here,

26:34.761 --> 26:35.862
or we don't have
all the footage.

26:35.895 --> 26:38.364
- You don't.

26:38.397 --> 26:40.499
We feel awful about this.

26:40.532 --> 26:42.835
- Jeffrey and Regina Prince,
this is ADA Rafael Barba.

26:42.869 --> 26:44.170
- Hey.
- How do you do? Hello.

26:44.203 --> 26:45.738
What don't we have?

26:45.772 --> 26:48.875
- We were just so devastated
by what happened to Melanie

26:48.908 --> 26:51.911
that we had the tech team
come in and scour everything.

26:51.944 --> 26:54.380
- Yeah, TARU took
your entire server.

26:54.413 --> 26:56.015
- Lizzie?

26:56.048 --> 26:57.449
- It's complicated.

26:57.483 --> 26:58.851
We have footage
from over two dozen cameras

26:58.885 --> 27:00.086
in different file formats,

27:00.119 --> 27:01.788
most of it mislabeled.

27:01.821 --> 27:04.523
The nighttime security got
stored on another hard drive.

27:04.556 --> 27:05.524
- Who knows how or why?

27:05.557 --> 27:06.693
If I understood tech,

27:06.726 --> 27:08.460
I wouldn't be in this business.

27:08.494 --> 27:10.362
I'd be in a mega yacht
off the cost of Capri right now.

27:10.396 --> 27:12.832
- Okay, so just show us
what you have.

27:12.865 --> 27:16.168
[tense music]

27:16.202 --> 27:18.871
- Melanie.

27:18.905 --> 27:20.339
You okay?

27:20.372 --> 27:22.942
*

27:22.975 --> 27:23.943
Are you awake?

27:23.976 --> 27:25.712
- See, it was Graham.

27:25.712 --> 27:26.979
Yeah, we were shocked.

27:27.013 --> 27:28.948
- You sure this isn't doctored?

27:28.981 --> 27:30.717
- I wish it were.

27:30.717 --> 27:32.952
- And this just turned up, too?

27:32.985 --> 27:35.287
We watched this footage
together.

27:35.321 --> 27:37.356
- Lizzie.
- It's motion-activated.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.792
When it finally woke up
it created a new file

27:39.826 --> 27:42.161
which also got mislabeled.

27:42.194 --> 27:50.202
*

27:58.778 --> 28:00.880
- So you magically just had
this one part

28:00.913 --> 28:02.281
that was for the live show?

28:02.314 --> 28:03.950
- There's not a jury
in the world

28:03.983 --> 28:05.151
that would believe any
of the stories you just told.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.753
- A jury?

28:06.753 --> 28:08.587
- Yeah, you've gone
past obstruction.

28:08.620 --> 28:10.322
You're looking at tampering
with physical evidence,

28:10.356 --> 28:12.158
a felony.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.926
- Believe me, it's all true.
I already fired the editor.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.228
- Uh-huh, and we believe you.

28:16.262 --> 28:17.429
Don't we have enough
to arrest Graham?

28:17.463 --> 28:18.798
- House of mirrors.

28:18.831 --> 28:21.467
Get Graham aside,
talk to Melanie.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.470
- It was Graham?

28:24.503 --> 28:27.073
He was always so nice.

28:27.106 --> 28:30.576
- You don't remember him
coming into the Dream Suite?

28:30.609 --> 28:32.144
You didn't consent
to having sex with him?

28:32.178 --> 28:36.015
- No.
No.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.317
Are you sure
that it was him?

28:38.350 --> 28:40.787
- The producers have footage
of him in the hallway,

28:40.787 --> 28:43.823
coming into the Dream Suite,
the whole thing.

28:43.856 --> 28:45.357
It's him.

28:45.391 --> 28:49.295
*

28:49.328 --> 28:51.597
- Lizzie must have known.

28:51.630 --> 28:55.267
Why didn't she say something?

28:55.301 --> 28:58.604
Why did Graham do that to me?

28:58.637 --> 29:00.606
- I went into the Dream Suite
because I was worried about her.

29:00.639 --> 29:02.708
- You had sex with her
while she was unconscious.

29:02.809 --> 29:04.176
- No, you've got it
all wrong.

29:04.210 --> 29:05.344
I-I was helping
the both of us.

29:05.377 --> 29:07.046
- Really?
How was that?

29:07.079 --> 29:09.715
- I saw Ryan leave,
I saw Gigi go into Ryan's room.

29:09.816 --> 29:11.550
I knew they'd make
the next round.

29:11.583 --> 29:12.551
I figured the only way for the
two of us to stay in the game

29:12.584 --> 29:13.920
was to join forces.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.554
- Ah, so that's why
you raped her.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.056
- It wasn't rape.

29:17.089 --> 29:20.026
- Let's go.
- She didn't say no.

29:20.059 --> 29:21.093
She didn't tell me to stop.

29:21.127 --> 29:22.428
Tell them, Lizzie.

29:22.461 --> 29:23.462
I told you about it
the next day.

29:23.495 --> 29:24.831
- Graham, it's over.

29:24.831 --> 29:26.198
- You interviewed me
the next morning.

29:26.232 --> 29:27.399
- You said that you went
to Melanie as a friend

29:27.433 --> 29:28.901
and then it turned
into something more.

29:28.935 --> 29:30.436
- And you said
everything would be fine.

29:30.469 --> 29:32.138
- Because I didn't know
that you had raped her!

29:32.171 --> 29:33.472
- Lizzie, let it go.

29:33.505 --> 29:34.740
You can take him
out of here, officers.

29:34.841 --> 29:36.575
- Hold on,
are you filming this?

29:36.608 --> 29:38.477
- Get this camera
out of here.

29:38.510 --> 29:42.081
- Legally, we're within our
rights to film the police.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.583
- Okay, Detective Tutuola,
not our concern.

29:44.616 --> 29:47.253
- Unless you're arresting me,
I'm not going anywhere.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.855
- Fine.

29:48.855 --> 29:50.422
- Turn around.

29:50.456 --> 29:52.859
- Graham Turco,
you're under arrest.

29:52.859 --> 29:54.260
You have the right
to remain silent.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.594
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

29:55.627 --> 29:56.863
in a court of law.

29:56.863 --> 29:58.630
You have the right
to an attorney.

29:58.664 --> 30:00.900
If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

30:07.907 --> 30:08.040
.

30:09.608 --> 30:10.576
- So you're claiming the sex
was consensual, right?

30:11.210 --> 30:12.544
- Yes.

30:12.578 --> 30:13.612
- Then why didn't you say
anything before, Graham?

30:13.645 --> 30:15.147
- The producers told me not to.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.083
They like the Ryan storyline
better.

30:17.116 --> 30:18.250
- If the producers told him

30:18.284 --> 30:19.986
to kill his friend
for the storyline, would he?

30:20.019 --> 30:21.187
- Hold on.
For what it's worth,

30:21.220 --> 30:23.255
Graham tested positive
for Chlamydia.

30:23.289 --> 30:25.691
Same bacterial strain
as Melanie.

30:25.724 --> 30:27.093
- The producers gave him up

30:27.126 --> 30:28.861
'cause we were about
to find out he was the rapist.

30:28.895 --> 30:30.696
- It's moot.
Got him now.

30:30.729 --> 30:32.331
How's Melanie doing?

30:32.364 --> 30:33.332
- She hasn't wavered
since she disclosed.

30:33.365 --> 30:34.867
- Good.

30:34.901 --> 30:36.135
I want to get her in front
of a grand jury tomorrow.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.836
Just keep her away
from those producers.

30:37.870 --> 30:39.638
They have been one step
ahead of us the whole time.

30:39.671 --> 30:42.174
I don't want any surprises.

30:44.543 --> 30:46.345
- Good evening, and
welcome to a special edition

30:46.378 --> 30:47.980
of "Heart's Desire."

30:48.014 --> 30:49.949
Monday night,

30:49.982 --> 30:52.451
millions of you watched Melanie
make a disturbing accusation

30:52.484 --> 30:54.620
against Ryan,
which we treated with...

30:54.653 --> 30:56.355
- Carisi, turn it on now.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.290
- We immediately shut
production down,

30:58.324 --> 31:02.261
and our executive producers,
Jeffrey and Regina Prince,

31:02.294 --> 31:05.731
investigated alongside
New York City's finest.

31:05.764 --> 31:09.601
- Once we learned that there
was a predator in our midst,

31:09.635 --> 31:13.372
we made it our mission
to catch the rapist.

31:13.405 --> 31:14.941
- They played us.

31:14.941 --> 31:16.142
- We can order in,

31:16.175 --> 31:18.978
have it ready by the time
we get to your place.

31:19.011 --> 31:20.479
- Sounds romantic.

31:20.512 --> 31:21.547
- Hey, Lu--

31:21.580 --> 31:23.449
Sorry.

31:23.482 --> 31:24.951
Didn't mean to interrupt,
but you got to see this.

31:24.951 --> 31:26.118
- Okay.

31:26.152 --> 31:27.386
- The morning
after the accusation,

31:27.419 --> 31:29.221
Lieutenant Olivia Benson

31:29.255 --> 31:33.960
and detectives from the
Special Victims Unit arrived.

31:33.993 --> 31:36.395
- My squad and I will interview
each and every one of you.

31:36.428 --> 31:38.965
- And we expect you
to cooperate fully.

31:38.965 --> 31:40.132
We're taking this
very seriously.

31:40.166 --> 31:41.667
If you saw something...

31:41.700 --> 31:44.136
both: Say something.

31:44.170 --> 31:47.439
- I told the cops I saw Graham
awake that night.

31:47.473 --> 31:49.508
They didn't care.

31:49.541 --> 31:52.611
This whole time, there's been
a rapist living amongst us?

31:52.644 --> 31:54.646
*

31:54.680 --> 31:57.316
And Melanie has been
blaming my Ryan?

31:57.349 --> 32:00.019
- It turns out, Gigi was able
to vouch for Ryan.

32:00.052 --> 32:02.989
The two of them spent the whole
night together in Ryan's room.

32:02.989 --> 32:04.856
The more we investigated,

32:04.890 --> 32:07.893
the more we realized
Melanie's story didn't add up.

32:07.994 --> 32:09.561
And it was about
to get much worse.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.563
- I got an STD from my rapist.

32:11.597 --> 32:16.402
- There it was, cold hard proof
that Melanie was assaulted,

32:16.435 --> 32:18.537
yet the Special Victims Unit
was no closer

32:18.570 --> 32:20.506
to identifying the perp.

32:20.539 --> 32:22.341
We knew we had to take
the investigation

32:22.374 --> 32:23.842
into our own hands.

32:23.875 --> 32:25.511
- Hey.
What'd I miss?

32:25.544 --> 32:28.114
- Melanie's a liar
and NYPD screwed up.

32:28.147 --> 32:31.017
- Yeah, I can't wait to see
who the heroes are.

32:31.050 --> 32:34.086
- Jeffrey, Regina,
I found something.

32:34.120 --> 32:37.456
Looks like it never got logged.

32:37.489 --> 32:41.793
Less than a minute later...

32:41.827 --> 32:44.296
and look now.

32:44.330 --> 32:45.797
There's not enough time
for an assault

32:45.831 --> 32:48.234
and Ryan never had
his clothes off.

32:48.267 --> 32:49.701
- She got an STD.

32:49.735 --> 32:52.371
What--what if
we missed something?

32:52.404 --> 32:53.905
That means that someone else
went into that room

32:53.939 --> 32:57.243
after Ryan left.

32:57.276 --> 33:01.380
- Okay, people, we're gonna go
through every piece of footage

33:01.413 --> 33:04.316
on every card and hard drive
in this triplex

33:04.350 --> 33:06.318
until we find out the truth.

33:06.352 --> 33:10.056
- We did, and we made it our
responsibility to inform SVU.

33:10.056 --> 33:12.524
- We were devastated
by what happened to Melanie,

33:12.558 --> 33:15.394
so we had the tech team come in
and scour everything.

33:15.427 --> 33:17.329
- They filmed us?

33:17.363 --> 33:18.630
- Apparently.

33:18.664 --> 33:20.299
- Son of bitches
wore hidden cameras.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.201
- No, no, two of them did.

33:22.234 --> 33:23.802
Those shots are from Jeffrey
and Regina's point of view.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.404
- Yeah, Lizzie,
their producer.

33:25.437 --> 33:27.739
Nothing from her POV.

33:27.773 --> 33:29.241
- That's not an accident.

33:29.275 --> 33:30.576
They're setting her up.

33:30.609 --> 33:33.712
- Lizzie, play it for them.

33:33.745 --> 33:36.182
- Melanie, are you awake?

33:36.215 --> 33:38.350
- It was Graham.
We were shocked.

33:38.384 --> 33:43.322
- Thanks to our due diligence,
the NYPD finally had a suspect.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.724
- She didn't say no.
She didn't tell me to stop.

33:45.757 --> 33:47.693
Tell them, Lizzie, I told you
about it the next day,

33:47.726 --> 33:49.928
and you said everything
would be fine.

33:49.961 --> 33:52.098
- Why didn't Lizzie
say anything?

33:52.098 --> 33:53.499
- Could she have
conspired with Graham

33:53.532 --> 33:55.767
to keep a rape quiet?

33:55.801 --> 33:57.403
Our investigation continued.

33:57.436 --> 33:58.604
- You're under arrest.

33:58.637 --> 34:00.106
You have the right
to remain silent.

34:00.106 --> 34:01.707
Anything you say can and will
be used against you.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.542
You have the right
to an attorney.

34:03.575 --> 34:05.711
If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

34:05.744 --> 34:06.778
- As traumatic as this was

34:06.812 --> 34:08.947
for all of our
remaining contestants,

34:08.980 --> 34:13.519
revealing the truth to Melanie
was even more heartbreaking.

34:13.552 --> 34:16.122
- It was Graham?

34:16.122 --> 34:17.889
He was always so nice.

34:17.923 --> 34:20.359
- God, they rigged
her hotel room with cameras?

34:20.392 --> 34:22.461
- The producers have footage
of him in the hallway,

34:22.494 --> 34:24.263
coming into the Dream Suite.

34:24.296 --> 34:27.233
- Lizzie must have known.

34:27.266 --> 34:29.268
Why didn't she say something?

34:29.301 --> 34:32.738
- There was one last shot for
Jeffrey, Regina, and myself.

34:32.771 --> 34:36.275
We were outraged when we
realized that Lizzie Bauer,

34:36.308 --> 34:38.310
our trusted on-set producer,

34:38.344 --> 34:41.780
knew the truth about this and
covered it up the whole time.

34:41.813 --> 34:44.150
- She was so desperate
to get a good story

34:44.150 --> 34:47.219
that she lost sight
of what was most important,

34:47.253 --> 34:51.323
which is the well-being
and safety of our cast members.

34:51.357 --> 34:52.924
- Even more upsetting,

34:52.958 --> 34:55.161
Lizzie tried to erase evidence
of the rape

34:55.194 --> 34:56.995
by hiding
and mis-filing footage.

34:57.028 --> 34:59.398
Graham Turco was under arrest,

34:59.431 --> 35:01.833
and we understand that tomorrow
a grand jury will be convened

35:01.867 --> 35:05.871
to indict him on charges
of rape in the first degree.

35:05.904 --> 35:09.708
Lizzie Bauer, I can assure you,
will never set foot

35:09.741 --> 35:12.644
on the set of
"Heart's Desire" again.

35:12.678 --> 35:14.580
- We want to say thank you
to Melanie

35:14.613 --> 35:17.816
for showing such bravery
and coming forward with this.

35:17.849 --> 35:19.885
We just want you to know

35:19.918 --> 35:22.188
that we are wishing you
the very best

35:22.188 --> 35:23.755
on your road to recovery.

35:23.789 --> 35:25.424
- When we return,

35:25.457 --> 35:27.293
a clinical psychologist
joins us

35:27.326 --> 35:28.760
for an in-depth discussion...

35:34.200 --> 35:34.300
.

35:36.001 --> 35:36.602
- Look, I don't care anymore.

35:37.769 --> 35:38.870
I'll still testify
against Graham,

35:38.904 --> 35:40.306
but what about the Princes?

35:40.339 --> 35:42.274
They put cameras
in my hotel room.

35:42.308 --> 35:44.776
They told everyone
that I had a disease.

35:44.810 --> 35:45.944
Can they just get
away with that?

35:45.977 --> 35:47.979
- I hope to God they don't.

35:49.681 --> 35:51.683
Just give me a second, okay?

35:54.686 --> 35:56.988
She's good to testify
later today.

35:57.022 --> 35:58.790
She just got blindsided
by the Princes.

35:58.824 --> 35:59.991
- So were we.

36:00.025 --> 36:01.427
They ransacked my witness list,

36:01.460 --> 36:03.995
manipulated footage,
forced the cast to lie.

36:04.029 --> 36:05.564
Now we have to respond
to their version of reality?

36:05.597 --> 36:06.665
- They're not stupid.

36:06.698 --> 36:07.699
They aired that last night

36:07.733 --> 36:09.000
so that everybody in the country

36:09.034 --> 36:10.135
would think that they're
the only ones

36:10.236 --> 36:11.237
trying to get justice
for Melanie.

36:11.237 --> 36:12.538
- Good TV,
good ratings.

36:12.571 --> 36:14.306
- Hang on.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.808
The Princes also went
specifically out of their way

36:16.842 --> 36:18.344
to make Lizzie look
like the only one

36:18.377 --> 36:20.546
who was guilty
of covering this up.

36:20.579 --> 36:24.350
- Right, they put it all on her
and made her the weak link.

36:24.383 --> 36:27.018
So let's go after her.

36:27.052 --> 36:28.820
- Me?
- Yeah.

36:28.854 --> 36:30.722
- That was all
Jeffrey and Regina.

36:30.756 --> 36:32.324
You know by now
how they edit this stuff.

36:32.358 --> 36:35.594
- So you didn't mislabel footage
on purpose,

36:35.627 --> 36:37.329
tell the other girls to keep
quiet about Melanie,

36:37.363 --> 36:38.397
hide the evidence?

36:38.430 --> 36:39.898
- No, it wasn't like that.

36:39.931 --> 36:42.601
- So what was it like, Lizzie?

36:42.634 --> 36:44.503
- I was asleep.

36:44.536 --> 36:46.071
The next morning,
I saw the footage.

36:46.104 --> 36:47.539
I called Jeffrey and Regina.

36:47.573 --> 36:49.575
They told me
to shut up about it

36:49.608 --> 36:51.443
and get the footage
off of the server.

36:51.477 --> 36:53.345
- So you did?

36:53.379 --> 36:55.281
- Yeah, it's their show.

36:55.314 --> 36:57.048
They said that if we played it
like it was Ryan,

36:57.082 --> 37:00.952
they would make sure that
Melanie went along with it.

37:00.986 --> 37:02.421
When I spoke with her
the next day,

37:02.454 --> 37:04.990
she didn't even bring it up.

37:06.858 --> 37:09.127
[tense music]

37:09.160 --> 37:13.765
I just didn't want to believe
that she was really raped.

37:13.799 --> 37:16.868
- That's your story.

37:16.902 --> 37:19.338
And we believe you.

37:19.371 --> 37:20.706
- The thing is, if we talk
to your bosses about it,

37:20.739 --> 37:23.709
they'll lie to our faces.

37:23.742 --> 37:25.076
They're good at that.

37:25.110 --> 37:27.646
*

37:27.679 --> 37:29.648
- But so are you, Lizzie.

37:29.681 --> 37:32.651
*

37:32.684 --> 37:33.685
- Hey.

37:33.719 --> 37:35.621
- Where have you been?

37:35.654 --> 37:36.955
What are we gonna do?

37:36.988 --> 37:38.357
The cops are coming after me.

37:38.390 --> 37:40.826
I am literally freaking out
over here.

37:40.859 --> 37:42.628
- Calm down, Lizzie.
Let's just talk.

37:42.661 --> 37:44.029
- Now you want to talk?

37:44.062 --> 37:45.497
You sold me out
on national television.

37:45.531 --> 37:47.132
- Relax.

37:47.165 --> 37:50.168
We'll get you the best lawyer
network money can buy.

37:50.201 --> 37:51.236
You won't serve time.

37:51.337 --> 37:52.871
Graham's the bad guy here.

37:52.904 --> 37:54.506
- So what am I?

37:54.540 --> 37:55.541
Collateral damage?

37:55.574 --> 37:56.542
- Come on, Lizzie.

37:56.575 --> 37:58.076
You're a smart girl.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.846
This is $100 million-a-year
franchise.

38:00.879 --> 38:03.915
We're not gonna let it get taken
down by one stupid mistake.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.651
- Mistake?

38:05.684 --> 38:07.786
He raped her and we all knew.

38:07.819 --> 38:09.588
- All right, he put it in her
for a few seconds.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.923
He's drunk, she's drunk,
I mean, maybe she raped him.

38:11.957 --> 38:13.925
It's--really,
it's not our problem.

38:13.959 --> 38:16.261
- Yeah, the problem is that
you tried to cover it up.

38:16.362 --> 38:17.796
You lied to the police.

38:17.829 --> 38:19.498
You made Melanie think
that she was crazy.

38:19.531 --> 38:21.099
- You did the exact same thing.

38:21.132 --> 38:22.100
You want to be an exec?

38:22.133 --> 38:24.570
Get used to this.

38:24.603 --> 38:26.237
What, did you think
we'd go on TV

38:26.271 --> 38:27.573
and say you came to us
about a rape

38:27.606 --> 38:29.641
and we told you
how to make it go away?

38:29.675 --> 38:31.443
- That's what happened.

38:31.477 --> 38:34.980
- Lizzie, how long have you been
working on this show?

38:35.013 --> 38:37.115
It doesn't matter
what happened,

38:37.148 --> 38:39.585
just what the audience thinks
happened.

38:39.618 --> 38:42.788
*

38:42.821 --> 38:43.822
- She filmed this.

38:43.855 --> 38:45.791
Is that even legal?

38:45.824 --> 38:46.992
- You put cameras in Melanie's
hotel room without her knowledge

38:47.025 --> 38:48.093
and then aired it
on national TV.

38:48.126 --> 38:49.795
That's a felony.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.863
- Not to mention
your little cover-up.

38:51.897 --> 38:53.532
That's another felony.

38:53.565 --> 38:55.467
Aiding and abetting a rape?

38:55.501 --> 38:57.603
That puts you on the registry.

38:57.636 --> 38:59.037
- Oh, come on.

38:59.070 --> 39:00.972
You--you can't be serious.

39:01.006 --> 39:02.441
- We are.

39:02.474 --> 39:03.909
What's that other show?

39:03.942 --> 39:05.411
"Let's Make a Deal"?

39:05.411 --> 39:08.246
*

39:08.279 --> 39:09.781
- The Princes will plead guilty

39:09.815 --> 39:11.950
to one count of tampering
with physical evidence.

39:11.983 --> 39:12.951
It's a felony.

39:12.984 --> 39:14.085
- They won't do time.

39:14.119 --> 39:15.454
- Probably not, they're rich.

39:15.487 --> 39:17.423
- But they'll never work
in TV again.

39:17.423 --> 39:20.759
- And yet, I can guarantee you,
"Heart's Desire" will go on.

39:20.792 --> 39:22.027
- In a way, though,

39:22.060 --> 39:23.862
you're lucky that they threw you
under the bus.

39:23.895 --> 39:25.431
Got you to cooperate.

39:25.431 --> 39:27.533
You hadn't done that,
you'd still be on the hook.

39:27.566 --> 39:30.268
- Great,
so I avoid a felony charge.

39:30.301 --> 39:34.740
I can't wait to put it
on my resume.

39:34.773 --> 39:37.208
Sorry.

39:37.242 --> 39:39.978
The show brought out
the worst in me,

39:40.011 --> 39:42.914
and I learned to bring out
the worst in those girls.

39:42.948 --> 39:44.082
Just so you know,

39:44.115 --> 39:45.316
I really was asleep
when she was raped.

39:45.350 --> 39:47.052
I swear.

39:47.085 --> 39:48.887
- We believe you.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.923
- Melanie won't.

39:51.957 --> 39:55.794
How does she get over this?

39:55.827 --> 39:58.464
- [sighs]

39:58.464 --> 40:00.131
- So Graham is
pleading guilty?

40:00.165 --> 40:02.901
- Yes, he knows
not to take this to trial.

40:02.934 --> 40:06.271
The good news is, Melanie,
that you don't have to testify.

40:06.304 --> 40:07.839
- Melanie!

40:07.873 --> 40:09.340
- Oh.
- Hey.

40:09.374 --> 40:11.443
My mom drove
from Idaho to pick me up.

40:11.477 --> 40:13.445
- Oh, nice.

40:13.479 --> 40:16.948
- I don't know what I'm gonna do
when I get home.

40:16.982 --> 40:17.949
I feel lost.

40:17.983 --> 40:19.317
- That's normal.

40:19.350 --> 40:21.753
It takes time, Melanie.

40:21.787 --> 40:25.256
But you will get through this,
I promise.

40:25.290 --> 40:27.258
- Do you know
what the worst part is?

40:27.292 --> 40:31.429
I actually thought
that Ryan and I were in love.

40:31.463 --> 40:32.631
- Come on.
- I thought he was going to

40:32.664 --> 40:34.666
ask me to marry him
in the finale,

40:34.700 --> 40:37.769
and we were going to live
happily ever after.

40:37.803 --> 40:39.204
- Take care.

40:39.237 --> 40:41.840
*

40:41.873 --> 40:44.843
- [crying]
Oh, sweetheart.

40:44.876 --> 40:49.347
*

40:49.380 --> 40:52.350
[crying]

40:52.383 --> 40:53.885
*

41:31.022 --> 41:33.892
[wolf howling]
