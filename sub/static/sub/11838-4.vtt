00:10.678 --> 00:14.313
Albani berries themselves.

00:14.315 --> 00:15.948
>> charlie: What's happening?

00:15.950 --> 00:17.616
You're, like, a berry salesman

Now or...?

00:18.319 --> 00:19.451
>> no, I'm a distributor,

00:26.460 --> 00:27.359
Through a 20-minute

00:27.361 --> 00:28.160
Presentation.

00:28.162 --> 00:29.461
>> mac: Oh, I get it now.

00:29.463 --> 00:30.662
It's a scam.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.131
>> no, no, no, no, no,

00:32.133 --> 00:33.365
It's not a scam at all.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.633
I also had reservations in the

00:34.635 --> 00:35.701
Beginning, but these super

00:35.703 --> 00:37.136
Berries grow in the andes

00:37.138 --> 00:38.070
Mountains, okay?

00:38.072 --> 00:39.538
Alpacas can survive entire

00:39.540 --> 00:40.639
Winters on this shit.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.674
>> oh, shit! So it's like a

00:42.676 --> 00:43.542
Super berry, huh?

00:43.544 --> 00:45.344
>> now what kind of superpowers

00:45.346 --> 00:46.245
Are you talking about?

00:46.247 --> 00:47.179
Like, do you survive

00:47.181 --> 00:47.746
The winter?

00:47.748 --> 00:48.480
>> great question.

00:48.482 --> 00:49.481
>> so is that the only super

00:49.483 --> 00:50.315
Power you get, surviving

00:50.317 --> 00:51.016
Winters?

00:51.018 --> 00:51.750
Because I've survived many

00:51.752 --> 00:52.684
Winters without these berries.

00:52.686 --> 00:54.319
>> no, I think I have an answer

00:54.321 --> 00:55.220
For all of this stuff, okay?

00:55.222 --> 00:56.522

01:02.563 --> 01:03.729
In your body caused by stress.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.064
>> all right. Where do I put

01:05.066 --> 01:05.664
My feet?

01:05.666 --> 01:06.532
>> wherever you want.

01:06.534 --> 01:07.666
>> I'm gonna put them on

01:07.668 --> 01:08.500
The stool.

Okay, here we go.

01:30.124 --> 01:31.190
>> units of stress!

01:31.192 --> 01:32.558
>> you're very, very high

01:32.560 --> 01:33.258
In your...

01:33.260 --> 01:34.193
>> that's a lot of units!

01:34.195 --> 01:35.027
>> ...In your stress unit.

01:35.029 --> 01:35.761
But don't even worry, because

01:35.763 --> 01:36.628
Invigaron can help you.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.097
These berries are chock-full

01:38.099 --> 01:39.064
Of antioxidants and

01:39.066 --> 01:39.698
Phytonutrients.

01:39.700 --> 01:40.532
>> oh, thank god.

01:40.534 --> 01:41.600
All right, I'm sold. I'm in.

01:41.602 --> 01:42.634
>> of course you're buying it,

01:42.636 --> 01:43.802
Because you're as big of an

01:43.804 --> 01:44.736
Idiot as she is.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.271
You're getting scammed, dee!

01:46.273 --> 01:47.372
>> it's not a scam!

01:47.374 --> 01:48.440
>> you walked into a room that

01:48.442 --> 01:49.575
You could have walked out of

01:49.577 --> 01:51.110
With a free set of golf clubs,

01:51.112 --> 01:52.744
But instead you got got.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.379

>> yeah, well, we won't get got

01:57.318 --> 01:57.816
Though.

Don't get got.

02:03.324 --> 02:04.223
You won't see us getting

02:04.225 --> 02:06.792

02:30.083 --> 02:31.416
>> hey-oh! All right, charlie,

02:31.418 --> 02:33.118
I signed you up for the gold

02:33.120 --> 02:34.186

02:34.188 --> 02:35.654
>> yeah. You know what's

02:35.656 --> 02:36.655
In here?

02:36.657 --> 02:37.789
Two cases of the juice, four

02:37.791 --> 02:38.757
Packs of the energy gel.

02:38.759 --> 02:39.758
>> nice.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.126
>> there's a box of shake mix,

02:41.128 --> 02:42.528
And I think they threw in a

02:42.530 --> 02:43.295
Bunch of protein...

02:43.297 --> 02:45.764
What are you doing, charlie?!

02:45.766 --> 02:46.532
>> what?

02:46.534 --> 02:47.599
>> what are you doing?!

02:47.601 --> 02:48.634
>> I'm drinking the berry juice

02:48.636 --> 02:49.668
To save my life.

02:49.670 --> 02:50.669
>> this is not about berries,

02:50.671 --> 02:51.436
All right?

02:51.438 --> 02:52.604
You sell it. This is a whole

02:52.606 --> 02:54.173
Moneymaking system, okay?

02:54.175 --> 02:55.207
That's what invigaron is.

02:55.209 --> 02:56.842
It's-it's about money,

02:56.844 --> 02:58.443
And it's about, you know,

02:58.445 --> 03:01.280
"wealth creation through-through

03:01.282 --> 03:02.614
The use of antioxidants,

03:02.616 --> 03:03.782
Powerful antioxidants."

03:03.784 --> 03:04.783
>> yeah, uh-huh.

03:04.785 --> 03:05.851
>> and, you know, we're going

03:05.853 --> 03:06.785
To "redefine success and-and

03:06.787 --> 03:07.686
Change the world."

03:07.688 --> 03:08.554
You know what?

03:08.556 --> 03:09.721
>> all those words are, like,

03:09.723 --> 03:10.622
Stressing me out, dee.

03:10.624 --> 03:11.690
And I can't get more str...

03:11.692 --> 03:12.791
I'm at 157!

03:12.793 --> 03:13.792
>> I'm gonna be honest.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.194
I'm a little confused as well.

03:15.196 --> 03:16.395
Uh, I don't have a firm grasp

03:16.397 --> 03:17.196
On exactly how this...

03:17.198 --> 03:18.730
>> where the hell is frank?

03:18.732 --> 03:19.665
Where the hell is frank?

03:19.667 --> 03:20.499
He can help us.

03:20.501 --> 03:21.500
He's, like, a business genius.

03:21.502 --> 03:22.467
>> I don't know where he is.

03:22.469 --> 03:23.335
He didn't come home this

03:23.337 --> 03:24.736
He took off last night.

03:24.738 --> 03:25.671
He said he had some dream

03:25.673 --> 03:26.371
Or something.

03:26.373 --> 03:27.339
And, like, he woke up, he's

03:27.341 --> 03:28.473
Like, "ah, charlie, I got to

03:28.475 --> 03:29.341
Get to the playground."

03:29.343 --> 03:30.342
And he shot out of here.

03:30.344 --> 03:31.310
>> why is he at the playground?

03:31.312 --> 03:32.844
He told me not to come.

03:32.846 --> 03:33.679
>> well, we got to go

03:33.681 --> 03:34.413
Figure it out.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.480
>> he can help explain all this.

03:35.482 --> 03:36.415
>> yeah, he's good with stuff

03:36.417 --> 03:36.915
Like this.

03:36.917 --> 03:37.649
We're not.

03:37.651 --> 03:38.483
>> all right, all right,

03:38.485 --> 03:39.885
I'm drinking this one though.

03:39.887 --> 03:40.886
>> yeah, but don't open

03:40.888 --> 03:43.655
Any more.

03:43.657 --> 03:44.823
>> frank?

03:44.825 --> 03:45.591
>> huh?

03:45.593 --> 03:46.892
>> what is this? You're stuck?

03:46.894 --> 03:47.893
>> was this your plan?

03:47.895 --> 03:49.261
>> frank: No.

03:49.263 --> 03:50.162
>> what is this?

03:50.164 --> 03:50.929
How did this happen?

03:50.931 --> 03:51.830
>> how does anything happen,

03:51.832 --> 03:52.497
Charlie?

03:52.499 --> 03:53.332
Move past it, will ya?

03:53.334 --> 03:54.333
>> I'm afraid that's going

03:54.335 --> 03:55.834
>> yeah. Where are your clothes?

03:55.836 --> 03:56.735
Why are you naked and stuck

03:56.737 --> 03:58.437
>> just get me out of here.

03:58.439 --> 03:59.338
>> all right, well, first

03:59.340 --> 03:59.838
We should do the

03:59.840 --> 04:00.539
Thing because..

04:00.541 --> 04:01.707
>> yeah. Charlie and I have

04:01.709 --> 04:02.741
A couple of business questions

04:02.743 --> 04:03.875
We wanted to ask you first.

04:03.877 --> 04:04.776
>> what? Deandra, don't

04:04.778 --> 04:05.544
Dick around.

04:05.546 --> 04:06.712
Get me out of here!

04:06.714 --> 04:07.846
>> look, I'll be quick, okay?

04:07.848 --> 04:09.248
Now, charlie and I have recently

04:09.250 --> 04:10.349
Come into a rare business

04:10.351 --> 04:11.450
Opportunity, and we were hoping

04:11.452 --> 04:12.618
You could clear a couple things

04:12.620 --> 04:13.685
Up for us.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.587
Can you look at that?

04:15.589 --> 04:16.755
>> it's a pyramid scheme.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.724
>> it's not a pyramid scheme.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.726
It's a reverse funnel system.

04:20.728 --> 04:24.429
>> turn it upside down.

04:24.431 --> 04:25.197
>> oh, shit!

04:25.199 --> 04:26.598
>> goddamn it! Shit!

04:26.600 --> 04:27.699
>> all right, you've been duped,

04:27.701 --> 04:28.433
Suckers.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.368
>> you're the sucker, okay?

04:29.370 --> 04:30.402
You're naked and you're stuck

04:30.404 --> 04:31.737
>> all right, calm down,

04:31.739 --> 04:33.372
Look, frank is there any way,

04:33.374 --> 04:34.406
You know, to get out of one

04:34.408 --> 04:36.308
>> all right, what you got to do

04:36.310 --> 04:37.376
Is round up a couple of suckers

04:37.378 --> 04:38.377
And get 'em hooked.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.278
Dummies with deep pockets

04:39.280 --> 04:40.712
Are the best.

04:40.714 --> 04:41.947
>> what about ben the soldier?

04:41.949 --> 04:42.914
>> well, he's as dumb as

04:42.916 --> 04:43.715
You can get.

04:43.717 --> 04:44.383
>> yeah.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.250
>> he's dumb as bricks,

04:45.252 --> 04:45.751
That guy.

04:45.753 --> 04:46.551
>> he's so stupid.

04:46.553 --> 04:47.419
>> all right, let's do it.

04:47.421 --> 04:49.221
>> we'll get him, and I'll get,

04:49.223 --> 04:49.955
Like, a pulley or a rope, and

04:49.957 --> 04:50.989
We'll just yank you out of there

04:50.991 --> 04:51.890
Or something, all right?

04:51.892 --> 04:52.824
>> get me out of here.

04:52.826 --> 04:53.725
>> yeah. Hold on, hold on.

04:53.727 --> 04:54.760
Charlie, whoa, think about this.

04:54.762 --> 04:55.827
If we get him out of there,

04:55.829 --> 04:56.828
How do we know he's gonna keep

04:56.830 --> 04:57.562
Helping us?

04:57.564 --> 04:58.430
>> well, what do you mean?

04:58.432 --> 04:59.398
>> if we get him out of there,

04:59.400 --> 05:00.265
He might scam us further.

05:00.267 --> 05:01.733
He's a business mastermind.

05:01.735 --> 05:02.734
I don't know what he's got

05:02.736 --> 05:04.403
>> shit, that's a good point.

05:04.405 --> 05:05.237
I mean, what's he doing

05:05.239 --> 05:06.838
What I mean? He wouldn't say.

05:06.840 --> 05:07.739
He could be up to something.

05:07.741 --> 05:08.740
>> I say we leave him stuck in

05:08.742 --> 05:09.775
There just for a few more days

05:09.777 --> 05:10.742
So we can leverage him for

05:10.744 --> 05:11.576
Business advice...

05:11.578 --> 05:12.511
>> right. We keep him contained.

05:12.513 --> 05:13.845
>> if we need questions,

05:13.847 --> 05:14.613
We just go to him.

05:14.615 --> 05:15.414
>> that's right.

05:15.416 --> 05:16.915
>> hey, uh, frank, we'll be

05:33.300 --> 05:33.932
>> save it, bozo.

05:33.934 --> 05:34.933
We're here for the free

05:34.935 --> 05:36.635
>> you got exactly 20 minutes

05:36.637 --> 05:37.602
To do your little song

05:37.604 --> 05:38.303
And dance.

05:38.305 --> 05:39.438
We're just gonna tune out, so

05:39.440 --> 05:40.539
Why don't you give us a wave

05:40.541 --> 05:41.373
When you're finished.

05:41.375 --> 05:41.940
>> or don't.

05:41.942 --> 05:42.841
>> what's the point?

05:42.843 --> 05:44.276
I'd just be wasting my time.

05:44.278 --> 05:44.876
I mean, obviously,

05:44.878 --> 05:45.844
You two are smart.

05:45.846 --> 05:46.945
>> 19 minutes and 50 seconds,

05:46.947 --> 05:47.612
Clown.

05:47.614 --> 05:48.613
>> don't get me wrong.

05:48.615 --> 05:49.781
Invigaron is great, but you got

05:49.783 --> 05:50.949
To put in the hours.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.317
You fellows strike me more as

05:52.319 --> 05:52.984
Men of leisure.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.286
(dennis scoffs)

05:54.288 --> 05:54.820
>> obviously.

05:54.822 --> 05:55.721
>> well, we are.

05:55.723 --> 05:57.289
>> yeah, I mean, this guy's got

05:57.291 --> 05:58.390
The hawaiian shirt, you with

05:58.392 --> 06:00.559
Bet it's killing you guys

06:00.561 --> 06:01.860
To be stuck indoors on a

06:01.862 --> 06:02.828
Beautiful day like today.

06:02.830 --> 06:03.962
>> it is. So less yapping,

06:03.964 --> 06:04.796
More golf clubs please.

06:04.798 --> 06:05.664
(dennis chuckles)

06:05.666 --> 06:06.832
>> yeah, I get it.

06:06.834 --> 06:07.799
And you know what?

06:07.801 --> 06:09.468
Because you guys are such great

06:09.470 --> 06:10.535
Sports, I'm gonna throw in a

06:10.537 --> 06:12.070
Coupon for a free round of golf

06:12.072 --> 06:13.638
At the dusty dunes resort

06:13.640 --> 06:14.473
In orlando.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.074
You guys been to florida?

06:16.076 --> 06:18.076
>> been there? Not physically.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.878
>> if you want, I can set you

06:19.880 --> 06:21.713
Up with one of their private

06:21.715 --> 06:22.547
Villas.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.683
>> (scoffs): Private villa.

06:24.685 --> 06:25.984
Whatever. That's pretty nice.

06:25.986 --> 06:26.885
Look at that.

06:26.887 --> 06:27.753
>> oh, it is nice.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.054
>> did you know that the average

06:29.056 --> 06:30.489
Rate for a hotel room 30 years

06:30.491 --> 06:31.757
Ago was $19?

06:31.759 --> 06:33.525
Today it's $237.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.560
That's a 1,300% increase.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.062
So it's not inconceivable to

06:37.064 --> 06:38.764
Think that in another 30 years,

06:38.766 --> 06:40.532
A week at a hotel runs you

06:40.534 --> 06:41.366
20 grand.

06:41.368 --> 06:42.834
>> that's not inconceivable.

06:42.836 --> 06:43.769
>> that's... Crazy.

06:43.771 --> 06:44.603
>> that's very, very

06:44.605 --> 06:45.103
Conceivable.

06:45.105 --> 06:45.837
>> really?

06:45.839 --> 06:47.539
>> okay, but not for you guys.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.107
You'll be locked in at $1,400

06:49.109 --> 06:50.709
Annually.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.511
>> wait. We would be?

06:52.513 --> 06:53.678
>> yeah. I'm not talking about

06:53.680 --> 06:54.913
Taking a vacation, guys.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.581
I'm talking about owning

06:56.583 --> 06:57.682
A vacation.

06:57.684 --> 06:59.017
And, look, if you're still not

06:59.019 --> 07:00.085
Comfortable with the numbers,

07:00.087 --> 07:01.052
You just double down.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.521
You get two weeks, sell

07:02.523 --> 07:05.023
That second week, boom, your

07:05.025 --> 07:06.024
Vacationing for free.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.392
> wait, wait, wait, wait,

07:07.394 --> 07:09.594
Mac, I think this guy just bent

07:09.596 --> 07:10.529
Himself over a barrel

07:10.531 --> 07:11.129
A little bit.

07:11.131 --> 07:11.863
>> he did?

07:11.865 --> 07:12.931
>> yeah, for our pleasure.

07:12.933 --> 07:13.799
Follow me here.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.600
Okay, so if we buy a second

07:15.602 --> 07:16.802
Week, and we sell that, we're

07:16.804 --> 07:17.636
Vacationing for free.

07:17.638 --> 07:18.537
What happens if we buy

07:18.539 --> 07:20.872
A third week and sell that?

07:20.874 --> 07:21.706
>> we're getting paid

07:21.708 --> 07:22.541
To vacation!

07:22.543 --> 07:23.041
(dennis laughs)

07:23.043 --> 07:24.709
>> you guys, I... I've actually

07:24.711 --> 07:25.644
Never thought of it like that.

07:25.646 --> 07:26.478
>> I know!

07:26.480 --> 07:27.479
>> I'm not sure I can make that

07:27.481 --> 07:28.146
Deal.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.047
>> the deal's locked in.

07:29.049 --> 07:29.881
>> deal's done.

07:29.883 --> 07:30.882
I'm gonna write in "three..."

07:30.884 --> 07:31.716
>> write in "three weeks."

07:31.718 --> 07:32.717
>> three here... That's done!

07:32.719 --> 07:33.552
>> yeah, right?

07:33.554 --> 07:34.419
Put three on...

07:34.421 --> 07:36.054
You thought we were a bunch of

07:36.056 --> 07:36.888
Suckers, but guess what?

07:36.890 --> 07:37.722
>> oh, god.

07:37.724 --> 07:38.590
>> we're not.

07:38.592 --> 07:39.558
We just bought three weeks of a

07:39.560 --> 07:40.158
Time-share. (laughing)

07:40.160 --> 07:42.160
>> so you did.

07:49.936 --> 07:51.570
>> not a great turnout.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.605
No, not-not a great turnout.

07:53.607 --> 07:54.473
You know why?

07:54.475 --> 07:55.407
Nobody gives a shit about free

07:55.409 --> 07:56.074
Soup, charlie.

07:56.076 --> 07:56.908
People want golf clubs and

07:56.910 --> 07:57.742
Concert tickets.

07:57.744 --> 07:58.743
>> don't knock the soup, all

07:58.745 --> 07:59.678
Right? Da'maniac's here.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.645
He's sucked down, like, three

08:00.647 --> 08:01.513
Bowls of it.

08:01.515 --> 08:02.180
>> yeah, he is here.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.081
And why is he here, charlie?

08:03.083 --> 08:03.915
>> well...

08:03.917 --> 08:04.916
>> nobody wants to buy something

08:04.918 --> 08:05.750
From a deranged wrestler.

08:05.752 --> 08:06.618
Why would you invite him?

08:06.620 --> 08:07.452
>> I didn't invite him.

08:07.454 --> 08:08.119
He just drifted in.

08:08.121 --> 08:08.987
I guess he was...

08:08.989 --> 08:09.855
>> just looking for soup.

08:09.857 --> 08:10.755
>> ...Looking for free soup,

08:10.757 --> 08:11.590
Yeah, free soup.

08:11.592 --> 08:12.457
>> all right.

08:12.459 --> 08:13.124
>> you know, drifters...

08:13.126 --> 08:14.092
All right, let's just get it

08:14.094 --> 08:14.960
Going, all right?

08:14.962 --> 08:15.861
>> yeah. Hello, everyone.

08:15.863 --> 08:16.761
Thank you so much for coming

08:16.763 --> 08:17.596
Today.

08:17.598 --> 08:18.463
Each one of you has been

08:18.465 --> 08:19.764
Hand-selected to potentially

08:19.766 --> 08:22.033
Join our invigaron team.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.602
"what is invigaron?" you may be

08:23.604 --> 08:24.703
Asking.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.049
Of you people.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.150
And then we discovered

08:39.152 --> 08:40.118
The invig...

You are way too hung up on the

08:55.035 --> 08:55.867
Berries.

08:55.869 --> 08:56.801
The success of the invigaron

08:56.803 --> 08:58.670

10:49.916 --> 10:51.282
>> he just stole the berries.

10:51.284 --> 10:52.150
That's not g...

10:52.152 --> 10:53.151
(machine beeping)

10:53.153 --> 10:54.019
Oh!

10:54.021 --> 10:55.754
Oh, 107.

10:55.756 --> 10:56.688
Hey, man, that's pretty good.

10:56.690 --> 10:57.355
(ben chuckles)

10:57.357 --> 10:58.256
>> what? Don't...

10:58.258 --> 10:59.090
>> healthy guy over here.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.125
>> charlie, no, that's terrible.

11:00.127 --> 11:01.092
He's very stressed out and he

11:01.094 --> 11:02.127
Needs to buy the product and eat

11:02.129 --> 11:02.927
The berries.

11:02.929 --> 11:03.795
>> oh, shit!

11:03.797 --> 11:04.696
>> I-I'm sorry.

11:04.698 --> 11:05.764
Um, I don't think this is for

11:05.766 --> 11:06.765
Me.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.199
>> oh, goddamn it!

11:08.201 --> 11:09.634
>> if 107's bad, I got to eat

11:09.636 --> 11:10.602
More berries.

11:10.604 --> 11:11.603
>> stop eating berries!

11:11.605 --> 11:14.272
You've had enough berries!

11:16.108 --> 11:17.375
(frank panting)

11:17.377 --> 11:19.110
>> I just don't understand.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.278
Is it a sexual thing?

11:20.280 --> 11:21.613
>> no, just get me the hell out!

11:21.615 --> 11:22.347
It doesn't matter!

11:22.349 --> 11:23.615
>> matters to me; I don't

11:23.617 --> 11:24.783
Think I can move past it.

11:24.785 --> 11:25.717
>> we came here for a reason.

11:25.719 --> 11:26.618
Let's just jump into it, all

11:26.620 --> 11:27.285
Right?

11:27.287 --> 11:28.153
>> all right.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.020
>> frank, we have a very

11:29.022 --> 11:29.988
Exciting real estate opportunity

11:29.990 --> 11:30.989
For you in sunny orlando,

11:30.991 --> 11:31.856
Florida.

11:31.858 --> 11:32.724
>> yes.

11:32.726 --> 11:33.692
How would you like to spend one

11:33.694 --> 11:34.659
Week out of the year living the

11:34.661 --> 11:36.027
High life at your own private

11:36.029 --> 11:38.663
Villa at the dusty dunes resort?

11:38.665 --> 11:39.698
>> you guys bought a time-share?

11:39.700 --> 11:40.365
>> well, yeah.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.232

11:41.234 --> 11:42.133

11:42.135 --> 11:42.967
Gullible?

11:42.969 --> 11:43.835

11:43.837 --> 11:44.803
>> no, this is different, frank.

11:44.805 --> 11:45.637
This is different.

11:45.639 --> 11:47.305
>> this asshole tried to sell us

11:47.307 --> 11:48.139
One week.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.641
We took the prick for three.

11:49.643 --> 11:50.375
>> you did?

11:50.377 --> 11:51.409
You took him for three weeks?

11:51.411 --> 11:52.310
>> dennis thought of it.

11:52.312 --> 11:53.311
>> you think he didn't want to

11:53.313 --> 11:54.145
Sell you as many weeks as

11:54.147 --> 11:55.013
Possible?

11:55.015 --> 11:55.980
>> no, I don't think he...

11:55.982 --> 11:56.881
>> I told you that might have

11:56.883 --> 11:57.749
Been a concern, I...

11:57.751 --> 11:59.384
>> the whole way over, you said

11:59.386 --> 12:00.218
That's...

12:00.220 --> 12:01.086
>> all right, fine.

12:01.088 --> 12:02.087
Well, look, I didn't come here

12:02.089 --> 12:03.054
To be criticized by a man stuck

12:03.056 --> 12:03.888
In a coil!

12:03.890 --> 12:04.856
Are you gonna buy a week or not?

12:04.858 --> 12:05.757
>> no, I'm not that stupid.

12:05.759 --> 12:06.424
>> we don't need this.

12:06.426 --> 12:07.358
We're out of here, frank.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.226
>> screw you.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.194
>> wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

12:09.196 --> 12:10.161
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

>> yeah?

12:11.832 --> 12:12.664
>> I can help you. Yeah.

12:12.666 --> 12:14.332
>> I'll give you a premium lead

On a deep-pocket dummy.

12:15.202 --> 12:16.067
>> premium lead?

12:16.069 --> 12:16.935
That's business talk.

12:16.937 --> 12:17.836
>> we need premium leads.

12:17.838 --> 12:18.670
>> yeah. Who?

12:18.672 --> 12:19.437

12:22.943 --> 12:23.842
Gonna leave you in a coil?

>> give us a name.

12:24.678 --> 12:25.677

12:30.383 --> 12:31.249
>> it is?

12:31.251 --> 12:32.117
>> yeah.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.017
>> he's very, very dumb.

12:33.019 --> 12:33.852
I mean, think about it.

12:33.854 --> 12:34.786
He went over there, probably

12:34.788 --> 12:35.754
Saw some pretty serious carnage.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.689
He's gonna have some bad ptsd.

12:37.691 --> 12:39.023
If we trigger that, he'll be

12:39.025 --> 12:40.191
Putty in our hands.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.192
>> right, whatever.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.026
Okay, get me out of here.

12:42.028 --> 12:42.894
>> no.

12:42.896 --> 12:43.762
>> nah. Nah.

12:43.764 --> 12:44.429

12:47.934 --> 12:48.767
>> yeah.

12:48.769 --> 12:49.434
Uh, you played your hand a

12:49.436 --> 12:50.301
Little too early, sucker.

12:50.303 --> 12:51.302
>> we'll come back when we need

12:51.304 --> 12:52.203
You again.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.071
That's called leverage.

12:53.073 --> 12:53.938
>> right.

12:53.940 --> 12:54.806
>> that's business talk.

12:54.808 --> 12:55.740

13:06.887 --> 13:07.752
>> now listen.

13:07.754 --> 13:08.887
We just need to trigger his ptsd

13:08.889 --> 13:09.721
A little bit, all right?

13:09.723 --> 13:11.322
>> couple of sudden movements.

13:11.324 --> 13:12.223
Loud noises.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.091
>> exactly.

13:13.093 --> 13:13.958
>> hey!

13:13.960 --> 13:14.826
>> hey!

13:14.828 --> 13:16.461
It's so good to see you, man.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.328
How are you?

13:17.330 --> 13:18.229
Come on in.

13:18.231 --> 13:19.130
Have a seat on the couch, why

Don't you?

13:19.966 --> 13:20.832
>> okay.

13:26.773 --> 13:27.505
>> well, I've come for the

13:27.507 --> 13:28.406
Presentation.

13:28.408 --> 13:29.407
Gonna be really cool, huh?

13:29.409 --> 13:30.408
>> oh, it's... It's sort of...

13:30.410 --> 13:31.976
Geared specifically towards ben,

13:31.978 --> 13:33.144
So...

13:33.146 --> 13:34.145
>> I like him, too.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.013

Nice to see you.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.421
All right, listen, so, ben...

13:43.423 --> 13:44.923
(music begins playing)

13:44.925 --> 13:46.424
Um, we would like to offer you a

13:46.426 --> 13:48.359
Week's stay in our time-share

13:48.361 --> 13:50.161
Condominium in florida.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.763
>> it's an amazing property.

13:51.765 --> 13:53.264
I mean, when we first saw it, we

13:53.266 --> 13:54.365
Were like, "boom!"

13:54.367 --> 13:55.266
(da'maniac gasping)

13:55.268 --> 13:57.368
(yells)

13:57.370 --> 13:59.938
(grunting)

14:03.142 --> 14:04.008
(sighs)

14:04.010 --> 14:06.144
>> sometimes, loud noises make

14:06.146 --> 14:07.979
The squirrels go in my head, and

14:07.981 --> 14:09.280
I-I don't fight in the ring

14:09.282 --> 14:12.283
Anymore, but I still fight with

14:12.285 --> 14:15.420
The demons in da'maniac's head.

14:17.957 --> 14:19.123
>> all right, well, we'll-we'll

14:19.125 --> 14:20.291
Try to be a little bit more

14:20.293 --> 14:21.392
Sensitive to that.

14:21.394 --> 14:22.560
>> I... Yeah.

14:22.562 --> 14:23.895
>> um, and we'll keep our voices

14:23.897 --> 14:25.063
Down from here on out.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.231
>> yeah.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.365
>> uh, ben, should we talk

14:27.367 --> 14:28.533
Numbers?

14:28.535 --> 14:29.901
>> oh, I don't know.

14:29.903 --> 14:31.903
Um, and it sounds really nice,

14:31.905 --> 14:33.338
But I'm not trying to make any

14:33.340 --> 14:34.472
Business decisions.

14:34.474 --> 14:37.175
I have a 107 stress level.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.343
>> ooh.

14:38.345 --> 14:39.477
>> I'm sorry.

14:39.479 --> 14:40.845
I shouldn't be here.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.013
I-I have to go.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.181
>> well, wait, ben, stop. Ben...

14:43.183 --> 14:44.349
>> don't go, ben.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.483
No, the sunshine state.

14:45.485 --> 14:46.851
(mac sighs)

14:46.853 --> 14:48.019
(door closes)

14:48.021 --> 14:49.187
>> oh, uh, I'm in.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.355
>> oh, no. Well, no.

14:50.357 --> 14:51.489
See, maniac, it's very

14:51.491 --> 14:52.857
Expensive.

14:52.859 --> 14:54.025
It's, like, $1,400.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.026
>> sold to the maniac for

14:55.028 --> 14:56.194
$1,400.

14:56.196 --> 14:57.362
>> really?

14:57.364 --> 14:58.496
>> you know why? 'cause I can

14:58.498 --> 14:59.864
Pay you in invigaron.

14:59.866 --> 15:01.032
>> I don't think you're quite

15:01.034 --> 15:02.200
Understanding.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.368
Uh, this involves you giving us

15:03.370 --> 15:04.502
Cash, not a product that we

15:04.504 --> 15:05.870
Would then sell.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.038
>> sure.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.206
>> see, we need cash money.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.374
>> oh, you're...

15:09.376 --> 15:10.508
We're on the same page.

15:10.510 --> 15:11.843
>> okay.

15:11.845 --> 15:12.877
>> I don't even understand what

15:12.879 --> 15:14.045
He's talking about.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.046
>> yeah. Hold on one second.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.214
>> no, take your time.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.382
>> listen, I think we might have

15:17.384 --> 15:18.516
Been wrong about dee and

15:18.518 --> 15:19.884
Charlie's little investment.

15:19.886 --> 15:20.952
I mean, they're out there moving

15:20.954 --> 15:22.120
Berries like crazy.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.288
If those bozos can do it, think

15:23.290 --> 15:24.622
How many you and I can sell.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.024
>> we could flip 'em, like, ten

15:26.026 --> 15:27.191
Times over.

15:27.193 --> 15:28.359
>> that's what I'm saying.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.460
So I say we swindle da'maniac

15:29.462 --> 15:30.628
While we got him here.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.196
Let's get in on dee and

15:32.198 --> 15:33.364
Charlie's little game.

15:33.366 --> 15:34.465
>> smart.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.633
Pyramid scheme and a time-share?

15:35.635 --> 15:37.035
We're diversifying our

15:37.037 --> 15:38.202
Portfolio.

15:38.204 --> 15:39.370
>> that's the thing.

15:39.372 --> 15:40.471
Okay, all right. Hey, maniac?

15:40.473 --> 15:41.572
>> yeah.

15:41.574 --> 15:42.640
>> hey, you just got yourself a

15:42.642 --> 15:43.641
Deal.

15:43.643 --> 15:44.609
>> we're in business together?

15:44.611 --> 15:45.310
>> yeah.

15:45.312 --> 15:46.210
>> that's so cool.

15:46.212 --> 15:47.912
I'm gonna go grab my stuff, and

15:47.914 --> 15:49.080
Then, if you wouldn't mind,

15:49.082 --> 15:50.481
Could you show me which room is

15:50.483 --> 15:51.249
Mine?

15:51.251 --> 15:52.317
I'd like a big room, if you

15:52.319 --> 15:53.251
Don't mind.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.452
We're gonna have so much fun.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.653
Invigaron.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.555
(door closes)

15:57.557 --> 15:58.890
>> uh... Is-is he under the

15:58.892 --> 16:00.058
Impression that our apartment is

16:00.060 --> 16:01.225
The time-share?

16:01.227 --> 16:02.393
>> it would appear so.

16:02.395 --> 16:03.561
>> okay, you know what?

16:03.563 --> 16:04.896
We'll deal with that later.

16:04.898 --> 16:06.064
Let's focus on getting ben to

16:06.066 --> 16:07.398
Crack.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.499
>> all right, now, between

16:08.501 --> 16:10.068
Da'maniac stealing our berries

16:10.070 --> 16:11.269
And these night vision goggles,

16:11.271 --> 16:12.570
We're in a bit of a hole, so

16:12.572 --> 16:13.571
We got to make this count.

16:13.573 --> 16:14.505
>> okay. What's the plan

16:14.507 --> 16:15.673
Exactly?

16:15.675 --> 16:17.075
>> we're gonna trigger ben's

16:17.077 --> 16:18.242
Ptsd, all right?

16:18.244 --> 16:19.243
We bust in like navy seals,

16:19.245 --> 16:20.244
Zip-tie his hands, bag over his

16:20.246 --> 16:21.412
Head, and then we bash him till

16:21.414 --> 16:22.513
He buys.

16:22.515 --> 16:23.514
>> ptsd-- that's so brilliant.

16:23.516 --> 16:24.515
How's frank come up with that

16:24.517 --> 16:25.416
Stuff?

16:25.418 --> 16:26.317
>> what can you say?

16:26.319 --> 16:27.185
He knows business.

16:27.187 --> 16:27.952
>> okay, ready?

16:27.954 --> 16:28.619
Locked and loaded?

16:28.621 --> 16:29.520
>> all right.

16:29.522 --> 16:30.521
Let's go, charlie.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.557
>> let's move.

16:36.261 --> 16:38.262
(men shouting)

16:38.264 --> 16:40.465
(gunfire)

16:40.467 --> 16:43.968
(men shouting foreign language)

16:43.970 --> 16:45.003
(dee and charlie screaming)

16:45.005 --> 16:46.004
(all yelling)

16:46.006 --> 16:47.305
>> oh, oh, oh!

16:47.307 --> 16:48.706
>> hey!

16:48.708 --> 16:50.108
>> what the hell are you guys

16:50.110 --> 16:51.275
Doing here?

16:51.277 --> 16:52.443
>> we were gonna try and trigger

16:52.445 --> 16:53.544
Ben's ptsd and make him buy our

16:53.546 --> 16:54.679
Shit.

16:54.681 --> 16:55.380
>> good luck.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.381
We've been at it all night.

16:56.383 --> 16:57.315
We broke in here, looking like

16:57.317 --> 16:58.449
Arabs, screaming at him.

16:58.451 --> 16:59.484
The guy's rock solid.

16:59.486 --> 17:00.551
>> why did you dress him like

17:00.553 --> 17:01.319
Ebenezer scrooge?

17:01.321 --> 17:02.987
>> he was actually dressed like

17:02.989 --> 17:04.989
He's clearly got some issues.

17:04.991 --> 17:06.157
I just don't know that ptsd is

17:06.159 --> 17:07.625
>> yeah, we've been watching

17:07.627 --> 17:09.127
Violent war movies all night to

17:09.129 --> 17:10.294
Remind him of the carnage that

17:10.296 --> 17:11.162
He saw in combat.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.163
>> I didn't see any carnage.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.631
Um, I actually had a good time

17:13.633 --> 17:14.532
During the war.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.300
I got to travel the world, uh,

17:16.302 --> 17:18.002
Try new, exotic cuisines.

17:18.004 --> 17:19.003
Well, I'm a computer programmer.

17:19.005 --> 17:20.171
>> what?!

17:20.173 --> 17:21.172
>> goddamn it!

17:21.174 --> 17:23.241
Frank told us this dummy was the

17:23.243 --> 17:24.375
Key to digging ourselves out of

17:24.377 --> 17:25.410
Our financial debt.

17:25.412 --> 17:26.477
>> what?

17:26.479 --> 17:27.678
Frank told us the same thing.

17:27.680 --> 17:28.679
>> well, that's interesting.

17:28.681 --> 17:29.680
So, we're all here doing this

17:29.682 --> 17:31.049
Because of frank.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.050
See, I told you he was up to

17:32.052 --> 17:33.217
Something.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.218
>> hold on a second.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.219
Getting all naked and cramming

17:35.221 --> 17:36.220
Yourself into a coil-- that's a

17:36.222 --> 17:37.221
Pretty good distraction, right?

17:37.223 --> 17:38.389
>> right?

17:38.391 --> 17:39.390
>> yeah, and think about it.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.391
He didn't tell us why he was in

17:40.393 --> 17:41.559
That coil.

17:41.561 --> 17:42.693
>> no, no, no.

17:42.695 --> 17:43.694
I just assumed that he went down

17:43.696 --> 17:44.695
There to pound off in the

17:44.697 --> 17:45.596
Nighttime.

17:45.598 --> 17:46.497
>> yeah, right, right.

17:46.499 --> 17:47.331
>> yeah, me, too. Me, too.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.332
>> but now I'm absolutely sure

17:48.334 --> 17:49.267
He had an agenda.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.334
>> I bet he was never stuck in

17:50.336 --> 17:51.369
That coil at all.

17:51.371 --> 17:52.403
He's been at the top of the

17:52.405 --> 17:53.604
Pyramid the whole time just

17:53.606 --> 17:54.739
Gathering our cash.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.074
>> oh, right, right, or at the

17:56.076 --> 17:57.675
I'm not sure which way it works.

17:57.677 --> 17:58.676
>> bottom of the funnel, top of

17:58.678 --> 17:59.677
The-- they're the same thing.

17:59.679 --> 18:00.611
>> yeah, well, I bet you when we

18:00.613 --> 18:01.679
Go down there, he's not even in

18:01.681 --> 18:02.447
There, is he?

18:02.449 --> 18:03.514
>> no. Hell, no, he's not in

18:03.516 --> 18:04.515
That coil, but I know exactly

18:04.517 --> 18:06.117
Where he will be.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.685
>> all right, everyone, we have

18:07.687 --> 18:08.786
A new addition to the platinum

18:08.788 --> 18:10.088
Sales staff, and let me just

18:10.090 --> 18:12.757
This guy is an absolute dynamo.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.292
>> scam! This guy's a liar!

18:14.294 --> 18:15.293
You guys are getting scammed!

18:15.295 --> 18:16.461
You're getting scammed!

18:16.463 --> 18:17.595
>> pyramid! Pyramid!

18:17.597 --> 18:18.763
>> rape! Rape! Rape! Rape! Rape!

18:18.765 --> 18:20.465
>> hey, hey, hey!

18:20.467 --> 18:21.599
What's going on here?

18:21.601 --> 18:22.767
>> well, I'll tell you what's

18:22.769 --> 18:23.534
Going on.

18:23.536 --> 18:24.735
We are saving these people from

18:24.737 --> 18:26.270
Years of financial rape.

18:26.272 --> 18:27.438
>> oh, hey, if you want out of

18:27.440 --> 18:28.606
Invigaron, all you have to do is

18:28.608 --> 18:29.574
Say so.

18:29.576 --> 18:30.274
>> wait.

18:30.276 --> 18:30.775
>> I do?

18:30.777 --> 18:33.144
>> look, you just, uh, sign this

18:33.146 --> 18:36.214
Release form, pay a $200 penalty

18:36.216 --> 18:37.381
Fee, your down line will shift

18:37.383 --> 18:38.549
Up to me, and then you're free

18:38.551 --> 18:39.383
And clear.

18:39.385 --> 18:40.551
>> that's it? All you got to do

18:40.553 --> 18:41.319
Is sign the document?

18:41.321 --> 18:42.787
>> yeah, does that mean we're

18:42.789 --> 18:43.588
Out of the time-share?

18:43.590 --> 18:44.655
>> oh, no, no, I'm afraid I

18:44.657 --> 18:45.823
Can't help you there.

18:45.825 --> 18:48.226
Those contracts are ironclad.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.727
I'm just relieved you didn't see

18:49.729 --> 18:52.096
The old opt-out clause.

18:52.098 --> 18:53.264
>> wait a second.

18:53.266 --> 18:55.399
He just subtly motioned to this

18:55.401 --> 18:56.267
Document here-- opt-out.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.735
Oh, crap, I've said too much.

18:57.737 --> 18:59.170
>> "buyer may opt out of the

18:59.172 --> 19:00.571
Contract within 72 hours for

19:00.573 --> 19:02.673
One-time cancellation fee of

19:02.675 --> 19:04.408
Only $2,000."

19:04.410 --> 19:05.409
>> you figured it out.

19:05.411 --> 19:06.744
>> oh, you fool. I have...

19:06.746 --> 19:07.745
>> you didn't think we were

19:07.747 --> 19:08.746
Gonna see this, but we

19:08.748 --> 19:09.514
Outsmarted you.

19:09.516 --> 19:10.248
>> yeah.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.282
>> we're a couple of foxes.

19:11.284 --> 19:13.084
All right, you got got!

19:13.086 --> 19:14.485
>> so suck on that little piece

19:14.487 --> 19:15.286
Of sweetness.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.487
(mac laughs)

19:16.489 --> 19:18.089
>> you also wrote "faced" in the

19:18.091 --> 19:18.589
Memo.

19:18.591 --> 19:19.690
>> ha! Nice!

19:19.692 --> 19:20.658
(laughter)

19:20.660 --> 19:21.659
>> should have known better than

19:21.661 --> 19:22.660
To get involved with a couple

19:22.662 --> 19:23.427
Sharks like you two.

19:23.429 --> 19:24.428
>> you should have. We're just

19:24.430 --> 19:25.496
Glad we're out from under frank.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.197
>> yeah.

19:26.199 --> 19:28.132
>> oh, "who's frank?" he says.

19:28.134 --> 19:28.833
Like he doesn't know.

19:28.835 --> 19:29.667
Come on, everybody.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.169
Frank's the guy who's behind all

19:31.171 --> 19:32.436
This; frank is the mastermind

19:32.438 --> 19:33.437
In the coil.

19:33.439 --> 19:34.705
>> I sincerely have no idea what

19:34.707 --> 19:35.673
You're talking about.

19:35.675 --> 19:36.674
>> oh, sure you don't, buddy.

19:36.676 --> 19:37.441
Well, guess what?

19:37.443 --> 19:38.376
>> he might not 'cause frank...

19:38.378 --> 19:39.510
>> uh-oh. Oh, shit.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.112
Oh, you thought we came in mad.

19:41.114 --> 19:42.213
Wait till you see what this

19:42.215 --> 19:42.847
Monster has to say.

19:42.849 --> 19:43.648
>> this guy?

19:43.650 --> 19:44.682
What are you talking about?

19:44.684 --> 19:45.683
This guy's the best salesman

19:45.685 --> 19:46.384
I got.

19:46.386 --> 19:48.352
>> yeah. He's already got 30

19:48.354 --> 19:49.187
People under him.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.388
>> I got to thank you all so

19:50.390 --> 19:51.622
Much for hooking me up with that

19:51.624 --> 19:52.356
Army guy.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.492
I got his whole platoon selling

19:54.494 --> 19:55.193
For me.

19:55.195 --> 19:56.127
>> wait a sec.

19:56.129 --> 19:57.461
Da'maniac's on my down line.

>> yup.

19:58.164 --> 19:59.830

20:06.306 --> 20:07.205
One second, guys.

20:07.207 --> 20:08.673
Actually, he's in my down line.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.241
You just bought out, remember?

20:10.243 --> 20:10.908

I want to get this stuff done

20:17.750 --> 20:19.317
Here, and then I'll meet you

20:19.319 --> 20:20.551
Back at our time-share, huh?

20:20.553 --> 20:22.853
Okay.

20:22.855 --> 20:24.488
>> now, what's going on there?

20:24.490 --> 20:25.489
Is he, like, living with you

20:25.491 --> 20:26.224
Guys, or...?

20:26.226 --> 20:27.825
>> he's... It's-it's a whole

20:27.827 --> 20:28.759
Thing. Just move past it.

20:28.761 --> 20:29.727
>> that's a hard thing to move

20:29.729 --> 20:30.428
Past.

20:30.430 --> 20:31.362
>> yeah, doesn't know what

20:31.364 --> 20:32.763
>> all right, but hold on a

20:32.765 --> 20:33.664
Second, hold on a second.

20:33.666 --> 20:34.565
Is frank still the mastermind?

20:34.567 --> 20:35.266
I don't get it.

20:35.268 --> 20:36.167
>> is he still in the coil?

20:36.169 --> 20:36.867
>> no, he's not still in the

20:36.869 --> 20:37.568
Coil.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.569
Come on, guys, he's definitely

20:38.571 --> 20:39.537
Still behind this.

20:39.539 --> 20:40.671
>> he's probably down in orlando

20:40.673 --> 20:41.672
Enjoying that time-share.

20:41.674 --> 20:42.673
He's long gone.

20:42.675 --> 20:43.874
>> right. Wherever he is, he's

20:43.876 --> 20:45.243
Having a real good time.
