You want one? They're awesome.
Thomas is a hell of a cook.

12:07.593 --> 12:11.689
- Playing catch?
- He's teaching me baseball.
It's nothing like cricket.

12:11.764 --> 12:14.198
Sam's checking up on the real thief.

12:14.266 --> 12:16.791
- Thomas should be out ofhere soon enough.
- There's no rush.

12:16.869 --> 12:19.030
I like having him around.
Thanks for suggesting it.

12:20.206 --> 12:22.140
I need a favor, Fi.

12:22.208 --> 12:25.609
I need you to reach out toyour
black market contacts-- the scarier, the better.

12:25.678 --> 12:29.045
- Is this about the dossier?
- It's about the man who burned me.

12:29.115 --> 12:31.208
He's hard to reach.
I need to recruit some help.

12:31.283 --> 12:34.775
- That's howyou're gonna do it?
- I've been accused ofbeing a major security risk.

12:34.854 --> 12:36.981
It's time I started acting like one.

12:37.056 --> 12:39.217
I know a few Iranians
who are coming into town.

12:39.291 --> 12:43.660
Ooh. Let's avoid people who use "Michael Westen"
and "jihad" in the same sentence.

12:43.729 --> 12:45.720
How about Libyans?
I hear there's a group here...

12:45.798 --> 12:48.323
talking to some
South American oil companies.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.391
See ifyou can set it up.

12:52.905 --> 12:56.238
- Hey, Mike.
- Hello.

- [ Exhales ]
- ??[Rock Continues ]

13:03.849 --> 13:07.341
Phone numberyou gave me
belongs to Lawrence Henderson.

13:07.419 --> 13:11.378
- Does he work at the hotel?
- Ha. I wouldn't say "work." He owns it.

13:11.457 --> 13:14.153
For now at least.
He bet big on the Victor.

13:14.226 --> 13:17.821
Now he's got a cash-flow problem.
So ifyou do the math, it's a little screwy.

13:17.897 --> 13:21.560
He's got two million bucks for a brooch,
but that's not gonna bail him out ofhis hole.

13:21.634 --> 13:25.035
But it might give him a year or two
to turn things around.

13:33.245 --> 13:36.271
- [Michael] Cops everlook at him?
- No, they cleared him.

13:36.348 --> 13:38.373
He had an alibi
and a fleet oflawyers to sell it.

13:38.450 --> 13:40.884
A fewyears back,
he had a club in New Orleans.

13:40.953 --> 13:43.854
It was hit by I guess you'd call it
a very convenient fire.

13:43.923 --> 13:45.857
Almost killed a busboy.

13:45.925 --> 13:48.621
He got the hotel
with the insurance money.

13:48.694 --> 13:52.095
Got a hell ofa security setup.
He's a little paranoid.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.893
Even paranoids have enemies.

13:53.966 --> 13:56.764
- You're livin' proof ofthat.
- What areyou saying?

13:56.836 --> 13:59.566
- Well, a little. I mean--
- We should go.

13:59.638 --> 14:02.300
The guywho owns the Victor
did this to me?

14:02.374 --> 14:04.569
- I don't even know him.
- It's not personal.

14:04.643 --> 14:07.043
You handled the brooch.
You had easy access.

14:07.112 --> 14:09.171
You're an easyfall guy.

14:09.248 --> 14:12.979
So what now? Can we go to the cops
with that guy Cristo?

14:13.052 --> 14:15.145
Mmm, what do we tell them--

14:15.221 --> 14:18.156
I broke into his house
and extorted information from him?

14:18.224 --> 14:20.920
Meanwhile,
Lawrence ditches the brooch...

14:20.993 --> 14:23.018
Cristo denies everything...

14:23.095 --> 14:26.428
and the only guys that go to jail
are you and me.

14:26.498 --> 14:29.064
It's fine.

14:31.199 --> 14:33.133
Hard or easy? Your choice.

14:35.970 --> 14:38.666
- Take Thomas out the back.
- No, I'd rather stay and--

[Michael Narrating] Whenyou're

14:58.326 --> 15:02.092
