WEBVTT

00:02.574 --> 00:04.006
Taylor!

00:04.075 --> 00:06.576
Get... out... of... bed.

00:06.645 --> 00:07.911
Mom, go away.

00:07.980 --> 00:09.813
No, it's 11:30.

00:09.881 --> 00:11.114
Oh, my G...

00:11.183 --> 00:13.917
This place is a dump.

00:13.986 --> 00:16.119
- Hey, I wasn't done with that quesadilla.
- No?

00:17.889 --> 00:18.922
Enough moping around

00:18.991 --> 00:20.123
because you hurt your stupid ankle

00:20.192 --> 00:21.291
and can't play volleyball.

00:21.360 --> 00:22.492
It's time to get on with your life.

00:22.561 --> 00:24.260
I have no life to get on with.

00:24.329 --> 00:25.862
"Oh, poor me.

00:25.931 --> 00:28.498
I'm Taylor. I'm just so young and thin."

00:28.567 --> 00:30.200
- Get your bony ass out of bed.
- But...

00:30.268 --> 00:31.601
Or I'm gonna throw
the frozen wash cloth at you.

00:31.670 --> 00:33.336
Not SeÃ±or Freezy!

00:34.639 --> 00:36.432
Ugh. Stupid bag.

00:36.457 --> 00:38.608
Hmm. Looks like I'm not the only
one making a mess around here.

00:38.677 --> 00:40.477
Don't make me cut you.

00:44.383 --> 00:47.250

00:54.526 --> 00:56.826
Mama, I need to start selling paintings

00:56.895 --> 00:59.095
for my Paintings for Pandas
school fundraiser.

01:00.132 --> 01:02.766
Anna-Kat, you should have gotten
started on this weeks ago.

01:02.834 --> 01:03.967
It's due in two days.

01:04.036 --> 01:06.002
I've had a lot going on.

01:06.071 --> 01:07.737
There's been some crazy plot twists

01:07.806 --> 01:09.105
on "Sofia the First."

01:09.174 --> 01:10.273
Okay, listen up.

01:10.342 --> 01:11.641
We're gonna call all your relatives

01:11.710 --> 01:13.843
and ask them to buy a panda painting.

01:13.912 --> 01:15.078
We'll start with Aunt Jean.

01:15.147 --> 01:17.714
We're not getting anything out of her.

01:17.783 --> 01:20.250
She gave me raisins for my birthday

01:20.318 --> 01:21.317
in a baggy.

01:21.386 --> 01:22.719
Anna-Kat, I'm your mother,

01:22.788 --> 01:24.421
and I know how to get things done.

01:24.489 --> 01:25.822
Call Aunt Jean.

01:27.292 --> 01:29.859
First, I'm gonna look up
some fact about pandas.

01:29.928 --> 01:32.095
I mean, we all know
they look like cuddly bandits,

01:32.164 --> 01:35.146
but what do we really know?

01:35.567 --> 01:37.967
<i>That's the second daughter
who isn't listening to me.</i>

01:38.036 --> 01:40.603
<i>Don't they realize that without
my strong hand guiding them,</i>

01:40.672 --> 01:42.205
<i>they'd end up pregnant at 16</i>

01:42.274 --> 01:44.874
<i>and running the front desk
at Just Tires?</i>

01:44.943 --> 01:47.081
- Oh, son of a...
- Language.

01:47.183 --> 01:48.878
...bitch.

01:48.947 --> 01:50.346
Sorry.

01:50.415 --> 01:52.315
All obscenity requests must be submitted

01:52.384 --> 01:53.917
at least half an hour in advance.

01:53.985 --> 01:55.351
What's the matter?

01:55.420 --> 01:56.519
I bought trash bags

01:56.588 --> 01:57.987
from a different store
than I normally do,

01:58.056 --> 01:59.222
and they don't work.

01:59.291 --> 02:00.457
Why didn't you get
the ones we always get?

02:00.525 --> 02:01.958
Because I went to Trader Joe's
for your almonds

02:02.027 --> 02:03.293
and then Stew Leonard's
for your produce,

02:03.361 --> 02:05.428
and then I was at Jeffers
for Anna-Kat's special yogurts

02:05.497 --> 02:07.297
when I remembered we needed trash bags,

02:07.365 --> 02:09.065
but I didn't have time
to make a Costco run,

02:09.133 --> 02:12.235
so I bought Jeffers' trash bags,
which are clearly defective.

02:12.304 --> 02:14.003
That's why.

02:15.140 --> 02:17.807
I'm always surprised at where just
a simple question can take us.

02:17.876 --> 02:19.609
These are going back.

02:19.678 --> 02:20.877
It's not worth your time to return them.

02:20.946 --> 02:22.412
That's what they're counting on.

02:22.481 --> 02:24.547
They don't think that people
will drive all the way back

02:24.616 --> 02:26.583
to return a $4 box of trash bags.

02:26.651 --> 02:30.186
But little do they know,
my time is worth nothing.

02:31.423 --> 02:33.089
Okay.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.733
Welcome to Jeffers!

02:43.802 --> 02:46.769
You call these bags
a "Smart Buy," but they're not.

02:46.838 --> 02:48.805
They're defective,
and I'd like my money back.

02:48.874 --> 02:50.840
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:50.909 --> 02:52.108
This box has been opened.

02:52.177 --> 02:54.711
- We can't issue a refund.
- Okay.

02:54.779 --> 02:57.280
You see, I wouldn't have known
the bags were defective

02:57.349 --> 02:58.982
had I not opened the box

02:59.050 --> 03:01.751
and used several of the defective bags.

03:01.820 --> 03:02.919
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:02.988 --> 03:04.821
There's nothing I can do.

03:04.890 --> 03:08.358
I can, however, alert you
to a Smart Buy on aisle 14.

03:08.426 --> 03:11.227
Tide Detergent,
Clean and fresh for only $3.99.

03:11.296 --> 03:12.495
Smart Buy!

03:12.564 --> 03:14.597
I will not be seduced
by another Smart Buy.

03:14.666 --> 03:15.798
Give me my money back.

03:15.867 --> 03:17.367
Okay.

03:17.435 --> 03:19.102
Since you're a loyal customer,

03:19.171 --> 03:21.473
- I'll exchange this box for another one.
- Fine.

03:21.582 --> 03:23.036
Do you have a receipt?

03:23.475 --> 03:25.275
- You want a receipt?
- Yeah.

03:26.311 --> 03:28.244
Well, clear your afternoon, buddy,

03:28.313 --> 03:29.445
'cause you and me,

03:29.514 --> 03:31.681
we're gonna find this receipt together.

03:39.891 --> 03:41.191
Oh. How'd it go?

03:41.259 --> 03:42.959
The manager exchanged the bags,

03:43.028 --> 03:44.861
and I finally cleaned out my purse.

03:44.930 --> 03:46.429
I found a key to who knows what,

03:46.498 --> 03:49.933
six Velamints, and Oliver's retainer.

03:50.001 --> 03:51.334
We grounded him for losing that.

03:51.403 --> 03:53.119
I accused him of lying and made him pay

03:53.197 --> 03:54.537
for a replacement out of his save jar.

03:55.774 --> 03:57.307
This dies with us.

04:02.047 --> 04:03.880
Have you been on the couch all day?

04:05.283 --> 04:06.716
I was watching that!

04:06.785 --> 04:08.751
Yeah, she's gone all in on those
Korean soap operas.

04:08.820 --> 04:10.019
I need to find out if Yay-Sun

04:10.088 --> 04:11.788
is going to marry that shipping magnate.

04:11.856 --> 04:14.490
It is time for you to find
your new calling.

04:14.559 --> 04:17.493
Now, since there's been
no motivation on your end,

04:17.562 --> 04:18.928
I've jotted down some suggestions

04:18.997 --> 04:20.663
of what could replace
volleyball for you.

04:20.732 --> 04:22.899
- Join the school paper.
- No.

04:22.968 --> 04:24.267
- Art class.
- Not me.

04:24.336 --> 04:25.568
- Photography.
- Lame.

04:25.637 --> 04:26.768
- You're lame.
- She actually is lame,

04:26.838 --> 04:28.071
on account of her ankle.

04:28.139 --> 04:29.639
I-I don't understand
why you're forcing me

04:29.708 --> 04:30.873
to do something I don't want to do.

04:30.942 --> 04:32.542
Because I know what's best.

04:32.611 --> 04:35.211
So you have one minute to decide
on another activity,

04:35.280 --> 04:36.913
or I will decide it for you.

04:36.982 --> 04:39.449
Katie, she may just need
a little more time to think about it.

04:39.517 --> 04:40.917
Greg, side bar.

04:40.986 --> 04:42.819
Why the hell are you agreeing
with her and not me?

04:42.887 --> 04:44.187
Traditionally in a sidebar,

04:44.256 --> 04:46.322
we would have a discreet
conversation to the side.

04:46.391 --> 04:48.558
Mom, I want Dad
to help me out with this one.

04:48.627 --> 04:50.760
You do?

04:50.829 --> 04:52.161
Yeah. You're also my parent.

04:52.230 --> 04:54.876
As a matter of fact, I am.
Sure, I'll take this one.

04:55.367 --> 04:57.433
Teenage daughter
is a high level of difficulty.

04:57.502 --> 04:59.202
- Yes. I live with her, too.
- Okay.

04:59.271 --> 05:00.391
But don't come running back to me

05:00.477 --> 05:02.672
when she shoots down
every one of your ideas.

05:02.741 --> 05:03.906
Irish step dancing?

05:03.975 --> 05:06.009
The doctor said I can't do
any strenuous activity.

05:06.077 --> 05:07.810
See? She's impossible!

05:07.879 --> 05:09.501
Okay.

05:09.572 --> 05:12.033
Let's call Aunt Jean and start
selling your paintings.

05:12.126 --> 05:15.685
No. Oliver said that calling people's not
the way to save the most pandas.

05:15.754 --> 05:18.521
Since when are you interested
in anything Anna-Kat does?

05:18.590 --> 05:19.922
Not now, not ever,

05:19.991 --> 05:21.557
but whoever sells
the most panda paintings

05:21.626 --> 05:23.459
gets a GameStop gift card.

05:23.528 --> 05:26.696
You only have two more days,
so you're working with me.

05:26.765 --> 05:27.964
Sorry, Oliver.

05:28.033 --> 05:29.699
I have to do what the Colonel says.

05:29.768 --> 05:31.167
The Colonel?

05:32.437 --> 05:34.337
Did she just call me "The Colonel"?

05:34.406 --> 05:35.905
What is that about?

05:38.443 --> 05:40.376
Somebody speak!

05:40.445 --> 05:43.112
You, who still needs bedtime stories.

05:43.181 --> 05:45.181
Okay. Don't be mad.

05:45.250 --> 05:46.516
Your full nickname is

05:46.584 --> 05:49.452
Colonel Beatrice von Beige
Underpants Control Freak.

05:52.791 --> 05:53.990
I don't know where to start first.

05:54.059 --> 05:56.059
Beige works under everything.

05:56.127 --> 05:57.927
And I am not controlling.

05:57.996 --> 05:59.829
You people just need
to be told what to do.

05:59.898 --> 06:01.230
Spoken like a true

06:01.299 --> 06:03.466
Colonel Beatrice von Beige
Underpants Control Freak.

06:03.535 --> 06:06.035
Not cool, buddy.

06:06.104 --> 06:09.272
If you all are so capable
without me, fine.

06:09.341 --> 06:11.040
Greg, you help Taylor.

06:11.109 --> 06:13.843
Oliver, you handle Anna-Kat. I'm out.

06:13.912 --> 06:15.378
But you'll all come running back,

06:15.447 --> 06:20.383
and when you do, I'll give you
my best condescending mom smile.

06:22.220 --> 06:23.619
Oh, we hate that smile.

06:23.688 --> 06:25.321
That's why I do it.

06:29.561 --> 06:32.228
Ugh! These are defective, too!

06:32.297 --> 06:35.298
I'd strangle that manager
with one of these

06:35.367 --> 06:36.699
if didn't think it would break!

06:36.768 --> 06:38.735
You guys have a nickname for me?

06:38.803 --> 06:41.771
- Super Dad!
- Oh, that's nice.

06:42.640 --> 06:44.173
Way to think on your feet.

06:47.488 --> 06:49.254
How about the school gardening club?

06:49.323 --> 06:51.649
Yeah, because I'm super into dirt.

06:51.750 --> 06:53.583
- What are you guys doing?
- Oh, just brainstorming.

06:53.660 --> 06:55.593
- Figuring out my future.
- Yeah, we're making progress.

06:55.662 --> 06:57.262
Yeah. Dad hasn't yelled at me once.

06:57.330 --> 06:59.064
Great. Good luck.

06:59.132 --> 07:00.632
I'm staying out of your lives

07:00.701 --> 07:02.634
because you all have it under control.

07:02.703 --> 07:04.574
- Your screen's too bright.
- It was fine the way it was.

07:04.599 --> 07:05.519
Okay. Go blind.

07:05.544 --> 07:06.671
Just know I've never seen

07:06.740 --> 07:08.740
a pair of sunglasses look good on you.

07:12.079 --> 07:13.111
Leave it.

07:14.247 --> 07:15.380
Oh, Taylor,

07:15.449 --> 07:16.815
the synchronized swim coach
got back to me.

07:16.883 --> 07:17.982
Technically, tryouts are over,

07:18.051 --> 07:19.384
but there's one
available spot on the team

07:19.453 --> 07:20.885
if you want to meet with the coach.

07:20.954 --> 07:23.221
I can't imagine there's anything
but available spots.

07:23.290 --> 07:25.890
I think you'd be great at it,
and your physical therapist said

07:25.959 --> 07:27.625
that water resistance is good
for building up strength,

07:27.694 --> 07:29.394
and this sport is very low impact.

07:29.463 --> 07:31.830
Great, so I'll have
a strong ankle and zero friends.

07:31.898 --> 07:32.864
Look.

07:32.933 --> 07:34.730
We're on the spot here with Mom.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.133
If we screw this up,

07:36.246 --> 07:37.669
we'll never have a say
in our own lives again,

07:37.738 --> 07:40.805
and we'll get the condescending smile.

07:40.874 --> 07:44.109
Ugh. Fine.
I'll try synchronized swimming.

07:44.177 --> 07:46.377
That smile makes me want
to jump off a bridge.

07:46.446 --> 07:48.346
As long you're holding my hand
when you do it.

07:55.989 --> 07:58.356
So, you think
this is how you score yourself

07:58.425 --> 07:59.524
some new video games?

07:59.593 --> 08:01.059
I do.

08:01.128 --> 08:03.328
It's very easy to say no
over the phone, Mom.

08:03.396 --> 08:04.929
But...

08:04.998 --> 08:07.165
how do you say no to this?

08:07.234 --> 08:08.433
It's true.

08:08.602 --> 08:10.535
She's so much cuter
than the rest of you.

08:12.172 --> 08:13.538
Excuse me, sir.

08:13.607 --> 08:16.040
Would you like to buy a painting
to help save the pandas?

08:16.109 --> 08:17.575
Actually, I'm late to meet a friend.

08:17.644 --> 08:19.043
Did you hear that?

08:19.112 --> 08:20.945
Hear what?

08:21.014 --> 08:23.648
It's the sound of pandas dying.

08:24.517 --> 08:26.484
"Save me."

08:26.553 --> 08:28.052
I'll take six.

08:30.724 --> 08:33.725
Colonel Beatrice von Beige
Underpants Control Freak.

08:33.793 --> 08:36.928
Please tell me you are not
still wearing beige underpants.

08:36.996 --> 08:38.863
If sadness were a piece of clothing,

08:38.932 --> 08:40.231
it'd be beige underpants.

08:40.299 --> 08:42.400
Man, I hope my kids have
a nickname for me

08:42.469 --> 08:45.003
like the "The Hammer"
or "Dream Murderer."

08:46.473 --> 08:47.972
It's not fair.

08:48.041 --> 08:51.009
What they call controlling,
I call being a good mother.

08:51.077 --> 08:52.510
Why don't you just look at this

08:52.579 --> 08:54.479
as an opportunity
to enjoy the free time?

08:54.547 --> 08:55.713
I know. It's crazy.

08:55.782 --> 08:57.916
But without solving problems
for my family,

08:57.984 --> 09:00.218
I'm just some chick running
errands in ugly underwear.

09:00.287 --> 09:04.422
So take all that free time
and go buy some new undies,

09:04.491 --> 09:06.057
maybe something in the red family,

09:06.126 --> 09:07.992
something non-hospice-y.

09:09.496 --> 09:11.629
Katie, believe me, your family
is gonna fall apart without you.

09:11.698 --> 09:13.665
Yeah, they are, and when they do,

09:13.733 --> 09:16.637
I'm gonna give them
a condescending mom smile.

09:17.203 --> 09:19.237
Oh, I do one of those,
but I do it while I tear

09:19.306 --> 09:20.538
the heads off their favorite stuffies.

09:22.609 --> 09:24.676
Doris, sometimes I prefer

09:24.744 --> 09:26.978
- you don't take my side on things.
- Yeah.

09:27.054 --> 09:29.591
Angela, can you help me file
a class action lawsuit against Jeffers

09:29.669 --> 09:31.763
for selling faulty garbage bags
to busy mothers?

09:31.787 --> 09:32.754
No.

09:32.755 --> 09:34.886
But as your legal counsel,
I strongly suggest

09:34.955 --> 09:36.788
you stop talking to us about it.

09:39.025 --> 09:41.392
I didn't realize synchronized
swimming was so cool.

09:41.461 --> 09:42.994
I like pools, and I'm a follower.

09:43.063 --> 09:44.595
It's, like, the perfect sport for me.

09:44.664 --> 09:46.397
When's your first day
as a Westport Water Lily?

09:46.466 --> 09:47.765
Practice tomorrow.

09:47.834 --> 09:50.868
I don't mean to gloat,
but tomorrow, the first of March,

09:50.937 --> 09:53.037
shall be a day that lives
in parenting infamy.

09:53.106 --> 09:56.074
I solved a problem your mother couldn't.

09:56.142 --> 09:57.709
I'm gonna give her
my condescending smile.

10:00.580 --> 10:01.980
Ohh. I got to work on that.

10:02.048 --> 10:03.247
It reads more handsome.

10:03.316 --> 10:05.049
Wait, did you say tomorrow's the first?

10:05.118 --> 10:06.951
- Yeah.
- Oh, no.

10:07.020 --> 10:08.553
- What?
- Great.

10:08.621 --> 10:10.722
First day in the pool,
and I'm gonna get my...

10:10.790 --> 10:11.856
Ugh!

10:11.925 --> 10:13.725
Can we stop by CVS on the way home?

10:13.793 --> 10:16.394
- What, do you need nose plugs?
- No, Dad.

10:16.463 --> 10:19.297
I need... girl stuff.

10:21.534 --> 10:22.900
Okay. Got it.

10:22.969 --> 10:26.070
- Maybe I should just text Mom.
- No, I'm cool.

10:26.139 --> 10:27.939
The human body is an amazing machine,

10:28.008 --> 10:30.408
and menstruation is part
of that miracle.

10:31.611 --> 10:33.878
- I'm gonna text Mom.
- Taylor, it's no big deal.

10:33.947 --> 10:36.981
I'll just give you my wallet,
and you go in and get what you need.

10:37.050 --> 10:39.584
No contacting Mom, period.

10:41.000 --> 10:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:00.306 --> 11:02.022
- I'm gonna turn on the radio, I think.
- Yeah.

11:06.579 --> 11:08.012
Hey, tell your mom the good news.

11:08.081 --> 11:09.514
I made the synchronized swimming team.

11:09.582 --> 11:11.182
Oh.

11:11.251 --> 11:12.617
I didn't know you were
interested in that.

11:12.685 --> 11:15.586
Me neither,
but it was all Dad... his idea.

11:15.655 --> 11:17.055
Great.

11:17.123 --> 11:19.659
It's sport, and she can do it
with her bad ankle.

11:21.027 --> 11:22.627
I got it.

11:22.695 --> 11:23.728
What's in the bag?

11:23.797 --> 11:24.796
Oh, nothing.

11:24.864 --> 11:26.497
Just some stuff I needed to pick up.

11:26.566 --> 11:27.999
Dad took care of that, too.

11:31.871 --> 11:34.505
- You're really killing it, aren't ya?
- Well, I don't know. I...

11:34.574 --> 11:35.907
Yeah. I kind of am.

11:37.544 --> 11:39.177
Hey, guys. How'd it go?

11:39.245 --> 11:40.678
We sold

11:40.747 --> 11:43.281
- almost 200 panda paintings.
- What?

11:43.349 --> 11:45.016
Pandas saved.

11:45.085 --> 11:46.384
Bam!

11:46.453 --> 11:51.089
Well, looks like everybody
is doing just great.

11:51.157 --> 11:53.758
I should probably go
to someplace where I'm needed.

11:53.827 --> 11:56.727
- I'm going to Jeffers.
- We're going with you.

11:56.796 --> 11:59.063
Anna-Kat, let's up our game.

11:59.132 --> 12:01.365
- I want pigtails.
- Got it.

12:08.608 --> 12:10.411
How's your day going so far?

12:10.507 --> 12:12.007
Who? Me?

12:12.067 --> 12:13.678
- Mm-hmm.
- Good, thanks.

12:13.746 --> 12:15.325
Well, it's about to take
a turn for the worse

12:15.418 --> 12:17.048
if you buy these defective trash bags.

12:17.117 --> 12:18.583
I'll be okay.

12:18.651 --> 12:20.017
No.

12:20.086 --> 12:21.219
No, you're not gonna be okay.

12:21.287 --> 12:23.121
Trust me... these bags will betray you.

12:23.189 --> 12:25.056
- Look, it's been a long day.
- Mm-hmm.

12:25.125 --> 12:27.925
I'm going to buy these bags
and be on my way.

12:27.994 --> 12:30.862
You have to listen to me.
I know what's best for you.

12:30.930 --> 12:32.196
Just let me do what I want!

12:32.265 --> 12:35.099
I can't stand by and
watch you make poor choices.

12:35.168 --> 12:37.502
These bags are no good.

12:37.570 --> 12:40.404
Learn from my experiences.
I have so much to offer.

12:43.042 --> 12:44.075
Got it!

12:44.144 --> 12:45.643
You are making a terrible mistake.

12:45.712 --> 12:47.211
Okay, lady, that's enough.

12:47.280 --> 12:48.746
You're out of here forever!

12:54.120 --> 12:55.987
<i>Ooh, beige!</i>

12:56.055 --> 12:57.455
Hey, you!

12:57.524 --> 12:58.723
Scatter!

12:58.791 --> 13:01.025
We'll reconvene at the Wendy's
across the street.

13:02.028 --> 13:05.963
We signed up 25 new people
for panda paintings.

13:06.032 --> 13:09.400
Brings the total up to 221.

13:09.469 --> 13:11.469
That's a lot of painting.

13:11.538 --> 13:12.703
What do I care?

13:12.772 --> 13:14.472
We'll just pick them up
from the painting people.

13:15.808 --> 13:17.408
You are the painting people.

13:17.477 --> 13:18.609
What?

13:18.678 --> 13:20.945
Who did you think was going to paint?

13:21.014 --> 13:21.946
The pandas?

13:23.917 --> 13:25.550
Maybe.

13:27.187 --> 13:29.620
Boy, you are stupid.

13:29.689 --> 13:31.122
Dad, call Mom!

13:31.191 --> 13:33.357
Is everything okay?
What do you need Mom for?

13:33.426 --> 13:35.493
It's the tampons.
I don't know how to use them.

13:35.562 --> 13:36.661
I don't understand.

13:36.729 --> 13:38.229
I've only ever used the other things.

13:38.298 --> 13:40.097
Oh, you mean the things
that Anna-Kat uses

13:40.166 --> 13:41.899
as lounge chair cushions
for her Barbies?

13:41.968 --> 13:44.302
Yes, and you can't use those
in the pool.

13:44.370 --> 13:46.437
Well, didn't the new things
come with instructions?

13:46.506 --> 13:48.039
Yes, but I read them,

13:48.107 --> 13:49.307
and they're just weird and confusing,

13:49.375 --> 13:50.841
and then I watched some YouTube videos,

13:50.910 --> 13:52.109
and they were even more confusing,

13:52.178 --> 13:54.347
- and I think I'm missing a piece!
- Of your body?

13:54.464 --> 13:56.447
Dad, gross! No! The tampon.

13:56.516 --> 13:57.682
Oh.

13:57.750 --> 13:59.917
You know, honey, it's okay. I got this.

13:59.986 --> 14:01.619
You don't "got this."

14:01.688 --> 14:04.589
You get upset when Mom
leaves them on the counter.

14:04.657 --> 14:08.025
Okay, okay. I'm calling your Mom.

14:08.094 --> 14:09.961
I just see that smile already.

14:10.029 --> 14:12.263
Should have pushed harder
for garden club.

14:16.069 --> 14:17.902
It's ringing, Taylor. Hang on tight.

14:19.239 --> 14:20.772
Hey, Greg. You're on speaker.

14:20.841 --> 14:22.907
Uh, yeah, I need to talk to you,

14:22.976 --> 14:24.542
and it's really not
speakerphone material.

14:26.313 --> 14:27.545
Anna-Kat's on Mars.

14:27.614 --> 14:29.214
You... cover your ears.

14:29.282 --> 14:30.749
I don't need to cover my ears.

14:30.817 --> 14:32.684
- I tune you out naturally.
- Ugh.

14:32.753 --> 14:33.685
I-It's about Taylor.

14:33.754 --> 14:35.687
Oh!

14:35.756 --> 14:37.856
I thought you had
everything under control.

14:37.924 --> 14:39.724
Yeah, okay.

14:39.793 --> 14:42.794
So, um, she's getting
her... monthly bill,

14:42.863 --> 14:45.230
<i>and she's decided to pay it differently</i>

14:45.298 --> 14:46.498
so she can get in the pool.

14:46.566 --> 14:48.700
What are you talking ab...

14:48.769 --> 14:50.401
Oh!

14:50.470 --> 14:51.903
Taylor's using a tampon
for the first time.

14:51.972 --> 14:53.071
<i>Apparently, yes.</i>

14:53.140 --> 14:55.573
Headphones! Where are the headphones?!

14:55.642 --> 14:57.375
And the instructions that came
with them are a little confusing.

14:57.444 --> 14:59.177
<i>Instructions? You mean the pamphlet.</i>

14:59.246 --> 15:01.279
Ignore the pamphlet.

15:01.348 --> 15:03.314
They always tell you to put
a leg up on the toilet.

15:03.383 --> 15:05.049
What kind of idiot advice is that?

15:05.118 --> 15:08.119
Aah, my phone's dead. My phone's dead!

15:08.188 --> 15:10.688
Mom says not to feel bad.
The instructions can be misleading.

15:10.757 --> 15:12.290
- What does she say to do?
- W...

15:12.359 --> 15:13.892
Do you want
to just talk to her yourself?

15:16.630 --> 15:18.129
- It won't fit.
- I know!

15:18.198 --> 15:19.597
Okay.

15:19.666 --> 15:22.967
All right, go.

15:23.036 --> 15:27.138
Mom said there's a thin part
and a thick part.

15:27.207 --> 15:29.340
Without putting it... where it belongs,

15:29.409 --> 15:31.209
put the thin part into the thick part

15:31.278 --> 15:32.710
so you can see how it works.

15:32.779 --> 15:35.613
Now, the cottony part
is what you insert.

15:35.682 --> 15:36.714
But not the string.

15:36.783 --> 15:39.317
Do not lose track of the string.

15:41.755 --> 15:44.122
Childhood over.

15:44.191 --> 15:45.957
What's Mom saying?

15:46.026 --> 15:49.194
She's saying way, way too much.

15:51.665 --> 15:53.998
The Colonel is here. Stand down.

15:54.067 --> 15:55.500
Thank you, sir.

15:58.538 --> 16:00.839
I always hung out with older girls,

16:00.907 --> 16:02.207
so I learned how to use them

16:02.275 --> 16:04.509
at a sleepover
at Karen Gilcrest's house.

16:04.578 --> 16:06.744
She and Patty Squillante

16:06.813 --> 16:10.481
screaming instructions at me
under the bathroom door.

16:10.550 --> 16:11.716
It was awful.

16:11.785 --> 16:12.784
Did you figure it out?

16:12.853 --> 16:14.152
Not that day.

16:14.221 --> 16:16.321
I crawled out the window and ran home.

16:16.389 --> 16:18.988
Thank God I had on
my Always MAXI pad with Wings

16:19.074 --> 16:21.543
for an active lifestyle.

16:23.096 --> 16:24.863
I'm sorry for being
such a jerk to you earlier.

16:24.931 --> 16:28.900
It's all right. I'm sorry, too.

16:28.969 --> 16:30.168
Actually, I'm not sorry at all.

16:30.237 --> 16:31.369
You had to get off the couch.

16:31.438 --> 16:33.504
- You're right.
- Now, come on.

16:33.573 --> 16:36.174
I will show you
how Lisa Pickett taught me

16:36.243 --> 16:38.615
to make a bong
out of a cardboard applicator.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.446
- No, thanks.
- That was a test. Good girl.

16:42.949 --> 16:46.217
Mom, can you come
down here for a second?

16:48.622 --> 16:50.221
You need me?

16:50.290 --> 16:51.756
It's been, like, 45 minutes

16:51.825 --> 16:52.957
and Anna-Kat hasn't even finished

16:53.026 --> 16:55.493
one stupid panda painting yet.

16:55.562 --> 16:57.629
I warmed up by painting a dog.

16:57.697 --> 17:00.632
We've got, like, 12 hours
to do over 200 of these things.

17:00.700 --> 17:02.367
There's no way we can deliver.

17:02.435 --> 17:04.068
We've taken people's money.

17:04.137 --> 17:05.435
We'll be put away for fraud.

17:05.505 --> 17:07.972
I want my first white-collar
crime to mean something.

17:08.040 --> 17:11.476
If you had asked my advice,
I could have told you

17:11.544 --> 17:13.678
that a 7-year-old
never thinks things through.

17:13.747 --> 17:15.146
That's why they lean back in the chair

17:15.214 --> 17:16.681
and get dry macaroni stuck
in their nose.

17:16.750 --> 17:18.683
Well, I need you now.

17:18.752 --> 17:22.086
Be the Colonel. Take control. Fix it.

17:22.155 --> 17:24.789
All you had to do was ask.

17:24.858 --> 17:27.258
Greg, Taylor, get in here!

17:27.327 --> 17:30.061
All hands on deck.

17:30.130 --> 17:31.329
We've got a situation.

17:31.398 --> 17:33.498
First thing that needs
to be done is this...

17:36.403 --> 17:39.737
Okay. Anna-Kat, get every
art supply from upstairs

17:39.806 --> 17:41.706
that you've ever squirreled away
and bring it down here.

17:41.775 --> 17:43.207
Oliver, we need to paint,

17:43.276 --> 17:45.109
so cover every flat surface
in the house.

17:45.178 --> 17:46.344
With what?

17:48.025 --> 17:50.713
I finally found something
those bags were good for.

17:50.799 --> 17:53.484
Sure, I don't need to control
every situation in this family,

17:53.553 --> 17:55.520
but things just work better when I do.

17:56.690 --> 17:58.189
Ah, man.

17:58.258 --> 18:00.058
Why do you keep using those?

18:00.126 --> 18:02.293
I don't know.

18:02.362 --> 18:03.795
I can't fix everything.

18:03.863 --> 18:05.530
You fixed everything for us today.

18:05.598 --> 18:06.898
It's time we return the favor.

18:06.967 --> 18:08.866
We're going to Jeffers.

18:08.935 --> 18:10.735
Really?

18:10.804 --> 18:12.270
Absolutely.

18:12.339 --> 18:13.604
What's the plan?

18:13.673 --> 18:14.973
I'll come with something, you'll nix it,

18:15.041 --> 18:16.374
and we'll do what you want to do.

18:17.377 --> 18:18.443
I love it.

18:23.016 --> 18:24.549
Everybody knows what to do?

18:24.617 --> 18:26.017
Yes. I keep the stock boy busy.

18:26.086 --> 18:27.185
I'm on the lookout in beverages.

18:27.253 --> 18:28.519
And I'll take out the manager.

18:28.588 --> 18:30.388
Oliver, you're with me.

18:30.457 --> 18:31.422
Let's move!

18:35.395 --> 18:36.527
Oh. Can I help you?

18:36.596 --> 18:38.663
Have you seen my mommy?

18:38.732 --> 18:40.264
I don't know where I lost her.

18:40.333 --> 18:41.599
Oh.

18:50.143 --> 18:53.544
Now, what's the difference
between 1% and 2% milk?

18:53.613 --> 18:55.880
Uh, 1%?

18:55.949 --> 18:58.950
Very good. Very good.

19:15.502 --> 19:18.336
There really should be
some sort of warning sign.

19:25.945 --> 19:27.578
Now that we've solved that mystery,

19:27.647 --> 19:31.416
let's unpack the mystery of... Kenny.

19:31.484 --> 19:34.452
How did you end up in this crazy place?

19:37.036 --> 19:38.856
Um, okay, okay. Cal... Calm down.

19:38.925 --> 19:41.559
Um, okay, can you tell me
what your mother looks like?

19:41.628 --> 19:44.462
She's soft...

19:44.531 --> 19:48.866
and cuddly,
and she smells really nice...

19:48.935 --> 19:50.334
and I'm never gonna see her...

19:51.504 --> 19:52.403
Never mind.

19:56.910 --> 19:58.376
<i>Mission complete.</i>

19:58.445 --> 20:01.345
<i>Mommies of the world, you're welcome.</i>

20:02.882 --> 20:05.349
I wanted it to say,
"These bags suck [bleep]"

20:05.418 --> 20:06.851
but I ran out of room.

20:10.860 --> 20:12.835
Don't go in there. You're gonna
get blown up immediately.

20:12.937 --> 20:14.970
Uh, told ya.

20:15.072 --> 20:16.438
If you want to play, play.

20:16.540 --> 20:17.840
I don't want to play.

20:17.942 --> 20:20.009
Strafe left, Anna-Kat. Strafe left!

20:20.111 --> 20:21.410
What's a strafe?

20:21.512 --> 20:22.578
Hit the front button.

20:23.948 --> 20:24.847
Gi...

20:24.949 --> 20:26.248
Give it to me.

20:33.324 --> 20:34.390
Oh, come on!

20:34.492 --> 20:37.726
You can't shoot me in the face
and then dance over my dead body.

20:37.828 --> 20:40.796
Yes, I can, because I just did.
