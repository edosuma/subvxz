00:18.852 --> 00:20.683
It's alive!

00:42.909 --> 00:46.003
Shut up down there! Trying to sleep!

00:49.916 --> 00:51.941
Look at me, I'm a lady.

00:58.925 --> 01:01.826
Well, my clothes are soft,
but they're not huggably soft.

01:01.861 --> 01:03.192
Leave it to me.

01:03.897 --> 01:08.391
Being huggably soft is my business,
and business is good.

01:08.435 --> 01:11.404
They are soft
and so are you, Cuddles.

01:12.439 --> 01:14.498
Very, very soft.

01:18.445 --> 01:22.313
- Where are we going?
- I need your softness.

01:26.653 --> 01:28.348
- This is a no-no.
- So soft.

01:28.388 --> 01:30.856
- A big no-no.
- Don't fight it.

01:37.730 --> 01:40.198
You might wanna clean yourself up.

01:47.407 --> 01:50.740
- Good as new!
- Yeah, good as new.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.905
My, you're just so huggably soft.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.040
No, no, not really that soft.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.476
Stop! This isn't right.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.317
Cuddles brand fabric softener.

02:02.355 --> 02:05.290
When your clothes have to be
huggably, rapebly fresh.

02:05.325 --> 02:07.885
I just want to help you
with your clothes.

02:07.927 --> 02:10.555
I don't want your sandwich.

02:13.066 --> 02:14.931
Did you finish that marketing proposal?

02:14.968 --> 02:17.198
- Nope.
- I told you to give it to me today.

02:17.237 --> 02:20.900
- I could have sworn you said Thursday.
- No, I said Wednesday.

02:20.940 --> 02:23.875
- I don't think so. Thursday.
- Wednesday, douche bag!

02:23.910 --> 02:26.743
- Thursday, ass face!
- Wednesday, you fucking idiot!

02:26.779 --> 02:28.076
What is going on here?

02:28.114 --> 02:31.174
We're having a fight about
the due date of the marketing proposal.

02:31.217 --> 02:33.777
Well, then there's only one way to solve it.

02:36.689 --> 02:39.487
Stapler, stapler.

02:39.526 --> 02:41.824
Post-it, Post-it, Post-it!

02:41.861 --> 02:43.351
Finish him.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.927
You know that proposal
was due on Wednesday, Jim.

02:49.969 --> 02:51.493
Thursday, Nancy.

02:51.538 --> 02:53.438
Hot coffee!

02:53.473 --> 02:54.667
Sexual harassment!

02:54.707 --> 02:56.675
Law suit, law suit.

02:56.709 --> 02:58.199
Letter opener.

03:00.980 --> 03:03.949
Ryan from Street Fighter?
I didn't know you worked here.

03:03.983 --> 03:07.612
I don't, but that proposal
was definitely due on Wednesday.

03:09.355 --> 03:10.982
I'll get right on it.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.458
- Daily mail, Administrant Griffin.
- Excellent.

03:13.493 --> 03:16.053
Next year's funding's come through.

03:16.095 --> 03:18.563
One dollar?
What will we do with one dollar?

03:18.598 --> 03:20.964
We're going back to basics. That's what.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.666
D- minus. Five, four, three, two, one.

03:27.774 --> 03:30.971
¤ Monkeys in outer space ¤

03:31.010 --> 03:34.207
¤ Protecting the freedom
of the human race ¤

03:34.247 --> 03:37.614
¤ Four fingers on his hand ¤

03:37.650 --> 03:41.484
¤ Spreadin' freedom across the land ¤

03:41.521 --> 03:44.718
¤ Protecting the United States ¤

03:44.757 --> 03:48.124
¤ We owe our freedom
to these primates ¤

03:48.161 --> 03:51.324
¤ Many died along the way ¤

03:51.364 --> 03:55.266
¤ In fact they all did,
but that's OK ¤

03:55.301 --> 03:58.270
¤ Monkeys in outer space ¤

03:58.304 --> 04:01.899
¤ Protecting the freedom
of the human race ¤

04:01.941 --> 04:05.104
¤ Monkeys in outer space ¤

04:05.144 --> 04:09.103
¤ They're easier
than humans to replace ¤

04:09.148 --> 04:12.174
¤ A human life is a terrible waste ¤

04:12.218 --> 04:15.449
¤ So we shot monkeys into space ¤

04:15.488 --> 04:19.048
¤ We used up all the monkeys
that we could find ¤

04:19.091 --> 04:25.258
¤ Fifty dead monkeys,
huge step for mankind ¤

04:25.298 --> 04:28.392
¤ Monkeys in outer space ¤

04:28.434 --> 04:31.801
¤ Protecting the freedom
of the human race ¤

04:31.838 --> 04:34.033
¤ Monkeys in outer space ¤

04:43.283 --> 04:44.773
I do the doo!

04:45.184 --> 04:48.711
Mr. President, your vitals all check out fine.
There is just one thing.

04:48.755 --> 04:51.451
Your mitichlorine count
is extraordinarily high.

04:51.491 --> 04:55.655
Does that mean I'm one of them,
what you call them, Jedis?

05:01.067 --> 05:03.126
Not tonight. I'm tired, honey.

05:03.736 --> 05:06.261
You're not tired.
You want to have a threesome.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.901
I'm not tired.
I want to have a threesome.

05:10.576 --> 05:12.806
Get me Condi.

05:17.550 --> 05:20.951
Sorry, W! Big Mac attack!

05:23.756 --> 05:25.485
What the dilly?!

05:32.732 --> 05:34.996
Saber beats rock.

05:35.034 --> 05:36.023
What the hell?!

05:51.751 --> 05:54.618
Who dares disturb my slumber?

05:54.654 --> 06:00.650
Who dares question
my daring of his dare? Jerk!

06:00.693 --> 06:04.595
It is I, I who freed the slaves.
I who united...

06:04.630 --> 06:06.689
Boring. Let's fight.

06:19.946 --> 06:22.608
If you strike me down,
I shall become...

06:22.648 --> 06:24.707
Wait a minute! Let me finish.

06:24.751 --> 06:26.742
That'll teach you, George Washington.

06:26.786 --> 06:30.813
Jenna, get over here right now.
I am your father.

06:30.857 --> 06:35.191
That's not true!
That's impossible!

06:35.228 --> 06:39.392
My real father would let me
go clubbing as late as I want.

06:39.432 --> 06:41.798
Why, you little...

06:41.834 --> 06:43.062
No, baby! I'm sorry.

06:45.471 --> 06:49.840
- You suck!
- No!

06:51.844 --> 06:54.108
- Was it just a dream?
- Mr. President...

06:54.147 --> 06:56.581
we still haven't found
any weapons of mass destruction.

06:56.616 --> 06:59.141
You have found
weapons of mass destruction.

07:01.287 --> 07:05.121
- Hi, we haven't.
- You have.

07:05.958 --> 07:08.449
- I don't know what you're doing.
- Bring me a taco.

07:08.494 --> 07:11.520
- Yes, sir.
- Tacos rule.

07:15.768 --> 07:18.601
Excuse me, could you please help me?

07:24.544 --> 07:27.911
Is everyone ready for more
of those uproarious bloopers?

07:27.947 --> 07:29.209
Yeah!

07:30.917 --> 07:32.612
Who let the dogs out?

07:32.652 --> 07:37.612
It's time to raise the woof with these
mishaps on the Lassie set.

07:38.825 --> 07:41.623
Timmy's in the well?
Let's go, Lassie!

07:42.662 --> 07:44.425
Get him off! Get him off!

07:45.565 --> 07:48.090
Timmy's in the well?
Let's go, Lassie!

07:49.435 --> 07:51.335
Let go! Fuck!

07:52.371 --> 07:54.931
Timmy's in the well?!
Let's go, Lassie!

07:55.975 --> 08:00.105
Get off! Get the fuck off me!

08:00.146 --> 08:02.307
Help!

08:02.348 --> 08:05.784
Boy, that guy really had it rough.

08:06.752 --> 08:08.686
Speaking of spay and neutering...

08:08.721 --> 08:11.155
Bob Barker was accused
of sexual harassment.

08:11.190 --> 08:12.851
Here's a Price is Right blooper.

08:12.892 --> 08:14.120
All right, big spin.

08:17.630 --> 08:18.995
Hold on.

08:25.605 --> 08:29.302
If you think that's the only time
things got awkward on a game show...

08:29.342 --> 08:32.470
here's some feud for thought.
Marjorie.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.003
Susan.

08:36.048 --> 08:37.106
Matthew.

08:41.120 --> 08:45.056
A later host of the Family Feud
would hang himself.

08:46.092 --> 08:48.526
Britney Spears' Chaotic
shocked the world...

08:48.561 --> 08:50.756
with its private moments
and low ratings.

08:50.796 --> 08:54.288
Here's some scenes
that were too chaotic even for UPN.

08:54.333 --> 08:57.734
We famous, baby. Yeah!

08:59.272 --> 09:01.900
No, baby. I'm famous.

09:01.941 --> 09:05.240
You're only famous
because I'm famous.

09:12.518 --> 09:14.110
Oh, baby.

09:17.623 --> 09:18.647
Stupid.

09:18.691 --> 09:21.592
You wouldn't think Nicolas Cage
and Michael Jackson...

09:21.627 --> 09:23.026
have anything in common...

09:23.062 --> 09:25.656
but they both poked their heads
into Graceland...

09:25.698 --> 09:27.632
and they both had their skulls on fire.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.430
Here's a Ghostrider outtake.

09:29.468 --> 09:33.598
- OK, Nick, are you ready?
- Yeah, let's do it. OK. Here we go.

09:39.445 --> 09:44.007
Did anyone teach him
to ride a motorcycle? Anyone?

09:44.050 --> 09:45.677
Who didn't masturbate...

09:45.718 --> 09:48.346
to Hulk Hogan's
bulging biceps in the '80s?

09:48.387 --> 09:51.845
Let's see what he's up to now
in Hogan Knows Best.

09:51.891 --> 09:55.452
Let me ask you something, brother.
Who wants peas?

09:55.494 --> 09:58.827
The Hulkster said,
who wants peas?

10:02.635 --> 10:05.729
Hulkamania's running mild, brother.

10:07.573 --> 10:10.167
Do you like watching
stupid people get injured?

10:10.209 --> 10:13.303
So did fans of MTV's Jackass.

10:13.346 --> 10:16.110
The network begged viewers
not to try this at home...

10:16.148 --> 10:17.706
but of course they did!

10:17.750 --> 10:19.684
Y'all recording? Here we go.

10:19.719 --> 10:21.710
Yeah!

10:27.093 --> 10:28.117
Go!

10:36.268 --> 10:37.257
Yeah!

10:41.440 --> 10:42.429
Come on, come on.

10:58.457 --> 11:01.221
That's all for today.
Hope to see you next time...

11:01.260 --> 11:04.195
for even more side splitting bloopers!
