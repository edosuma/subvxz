WEBVTT

00:02.235 --> 00:03.902
The interface
is pretty simple.

00:03.904 --> 00:06.187
You put your horizontal "X"
coordinate here,

00:06.189 --> 00:08.223
vertical "Y"
coordinate here.

00:08.225 --> 00:10.559
When you're happy with those,
you press this button.

00:10.561 --> 00:12.744
Got it.

00:15.999 --> 00:19.034
Leonard, you'll never guess
who I just found online-- Hey!

00:21.554 --> 00:23.055
Nice shot.

00:23.057 --> 00:25.440
Eh, his giant head
did most of the work.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.559
Very mature.

00:27.561 --> 00:30.062
You're lucky
I'm out of Silly String.

00:31.213 --> 00:32.647
As I was saying, Leonard,

00:32.649 --> 00:36.018
you'll never guess who I just
found online: Professor Proton.

00:36.020 --> 00:37.052
You're kidding.

00:37.054 --> 00:38.186
He's still alive?

00:38.188 --> 00:39.387
Yes!

00:39.389 --> 00:40.555
Who's Professor Proton?

00:40.557 --> 00:42.941
He was the host
of this great-- Hey!

00:42.943 --> 00:44.409
Yes!

00:44.411 --> 00:46.061
Sorry, tell me
about Professor Proton.

00:46.063 --> 00:48.530
Professor Proton hosted
my favorite science show

00:48.532 --> 00:49.948
when I was a child.

00:49.950 --> 00:51.666
I never missed
an episode.

00:51.668 --> 00:54.002
He demonstrated
scientific principles

00:54.004 --> 00:55.087
using everyday objects.

00:55.089 --> 00:56.338
It was pretty cool.

00:56.340 --> 01:00.042
Aw, so cute when you use
the word "cool" wrong.

01:00.793 --> 01:03.428
Like when kids say "pasghetti."

01:03.430 --> 01:05.297
Oh, dear Lord!

01:05.299 --> 01:06.515
Leonard, look!

01:06.517 --> 01:09.184
He's still available
for parties and events.

01:09.186 --> 01:10.469
We should hire him.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.020
Hire him to do what?

01:12.022 --> 01:13.722
Well, whatever
we want.

01:13.724 --> 01:16.141
Hang out, do
experiments,

01:16.143 --> 01:17.526
make him take 12
pictures with us

01:17.528 --> 01:19.027
so we can make
a calendar.

01:19.979 --> 01:21.813
It would be pretty awesome
to hang out with him.

01:21.815 --> 01:24.282
I just used "awesome" wrong,
didn't I?

01:25.368 --> 01:27.369
Well, I'm e-mailing
him right now.

01:27.371 --> 01:29.371
Do you remember
his old theme song?

01:29.373 --> 01:30.739
Of course I do.

02:07.136 --> 02:08.502
Hey, I just found out

02:08.505 --> 02:10.538
I have to be at
the telescope lab all weekend.

02:10.539 --> 02:12.840
Any chance you and Bernadette
could take care of my dog?

02:12.842 --> 02:14.609
Why don't you put her
in a kennel?

02:14.611 --> 02:17.478
Why don't you put your mother
in a home?

02:19.865 --> 02:23.401
To be honest,
she'd do better in the kennel.

02:24.169 --> 02:25.453
I'll talk to Bernie.

02:25.455 --> 02:26.621
I'm sure it's fine.

02:26.623 --> 02:27.672
Thank you.

02:27.674 --> 02:30.291
It's happening!
It's happening!

02:30.293 --> 02:32.627
Professor Proton is coming
to our house.

02:32.629 --> 02:33.928
You're kidding!

02:33.930 --> 02:37.382
You mean the guy who used
to host that lame kids show?

02:37.384 --> 02:40.268
And you just
got yourself uninvited.

02:40.270 --> 02:42.887
See? I told you I'd find
a tactful way to do that.

02:43.839 --> 02:45.890
How'd you get him to
come to your house?

02:45.892 --> 02:47.892
As Professor Proton
always says,

02:47.894 --> 02:50.144
"There is no problem
you can't solve

02:50.146 --> 02:51.813
if you use your noggin."

02:51.815 --> 02:54.181
And he wrote him a check.
Yeah, that, too. Big check.

02:57.453 --> 02:59.787
Uncle Howard!

03:03.859 --> 03:06.527
Cinnamon's here
for her sleepover party!

03:09.131 --> 03:12.266
You know if you had a stroke,
she'd eat you, right?

03:12.268 --> 03:16.004
And it would be my pleasure
to be her num-num.

03:18.640 --> 03:21.726
Okay, so what do I need to know
to take care of her?

03:21.728 --> 03:23.177
It's very simple.

03:23.179 --> 03:25.680
For breakfast, she has
an egg-white frittata.

03:25.682 --> 03:27.148
Feel free
to give her a choice

03:27.150 --> 03:29.383
of home fries or
an English muffin, but not both.

03:29.385 --> 03:31.552
We're watching our weight.

03:31.554 --> 03:33.271
Uh, for dinner,
something simple--

03:33.273 --> 03:36.691
a veal chop, some scampi,
whatever you like.

03:37.776 --> 03:39.527
Classy dog.
Yes.

03:39.529 --> 03:41.496
Also, don't forget
to close the toilet

03:41.498 --> 03:43.114
or she'll drink out of it.

03:43.116 --> 03:45.066
I feel for ya.

03:45.068 --> 03:49.003
I've got a psychotic mommy, too.

03:54.043 --> 03:56.711
Leonard, are you in bed?

03:58.213 --> 04:00.314
Yes.

04:00.316 --> 04:03.401
Me, too.

04:03.403 --> 04:05.720
Great.

04:05.722 --> 04:06.921
I can't sleep.

04:08.108 --> 04:10.925
Well, I can, so shut up.

04:10.927 --> 04:14.378
Do you realize that
in less than nine hours,

04:14.380 --> 04:17.115
Arthur Jeffries,
aka Professor Proton,

04:17.117 --> 04:18.683
will be in our apartment?

04:18.685 --> 04:21.435
Sheldon, you know that
if you stay up all night,

04:21.437 --> 04:22.653
you're gonna be sleepy tomorrow.

04:22.655 --> 04:24.789
And a sleepy Sheldon
is a cranky Sheldon.

04:24.791 --> 04:26.157
And a cranky Sheldon...

04:26.159 --> 04:28.126
is actually no different than
a regular Sheldon.

04:28.128 --> 04:29.961
Good night!

04:33.549 --> 04:36.651
I'm thinking
of wearing a tuxedo.

04:36.653 --> 04:38.469
That's not ridiculous.

04:38.471 --> 04:40.922
Good night.

04:43.125 --> 04:46.144
Do you have cufflinks?

04:46.146 --> 04:47.311
No.

04:47.313 --> 04:49.464
Ah, just as well.
Where can you rent a tuxedo

04:49.466 --> 04:50.832
at 3:00 in the morning?

04:50.834 --> 04:53.317
Okay, good night.

04:56.121 --> 04:58.456
Nice to meet you,
Professor Proton.

04:59.958 --> 05:02.243
Nice to meet <i>you,</i>
Professor Proton.

05:03.028 --> 05:06.330
Nice to meet you,
Professor Proton.

05:07.199 --> 05:10.151
Nice to meet you,
Professor Proton.

05:10.153 --> 05:11.736
Nice to meet you, Prof...

05:11.738 --> 05:13.838
Ow!

05:15.000 --> 05:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:34.059 --> 05:37.345
Leonard?

05:37.347 --> 05:39.647
What?

05:39.649 --> 05:42.183
I still can't sleep.

05:44.403 --> 05:47.488
She really tuckered
herself out at the park, huh?

05:47.490 --> 05:49.357
Yeah, you two were so
cute playing together.

05:49.359 --> 05:51.409
It was kind of fun
throwing a ball

05:51.411 --> 05:54.712
and not having anyone
laugh at me.

05:54.714 --> 05:57.048
And you were sweet
not to throw it too far

05:57.050 --> 05:59.050
so she didn't wear out
her tiny legs.

05:59.052 --> 06:01.502
Yeah, that's what I was doing.

06:02.921 --> 06:05.039
You know, there were
a few moments today

06:05.041 --> 06:07.308
when I almost felt like
we were a little family.

06:07.310 --> 06:08.809
Really?
Yeah.

06:08.811 --> 06:10.311
I never thought of
myself as a mom,

06:10.313 --> 06:12.313
but when the three of us
were out there having fun,

06:12.315 --> 06:14.098
I felt like maybe
someday we could do it.

06:14.100 --> 06:16.150
Of course we can.

06:17.636 --> 06:20.621
Especially if our baby's
as calm and quiet

06:20.623 --> 06:22.490
as little Cinna...

06:22.492 --> 06:24.792
Son of a bitch, she's gone!

06:24.794 --> 06:26.727
Where'd she go?!

06:26.729 --> 06:28.529
I don't know!
She didn't leave a note!

06:28.531 --> 06:30.164
You were the one

06:30.166 --> 06:32.566
who was supposed to put her
back in the stroller!

06:32.568 --> 06:33.751
No, I wasn't! You were!

06:33.753 --> 06:35.453
No, I wasn't!
Yes, you were!

06:35.455 --> 06:37.872
Yeah, well,
you throw like a girl!

06:45.080 --> 06:47.465
I'm getting worried.

06:47.467 --> 06:50.785
Relax, Sheldon, he's only
a few minutes late.

06:50.787 --> 06:53.688
Professor Proton was never late
when he was on TV.

06:53.690 --> 06:56.257
You know, every day, 4:00,
he was there.

06:57.759 --> 06:59.360
Unless tornadoes
were ripping apart East Texas,

06:59.362 --> 07:01.445
in which case,
we'd join him in progress.

07:05.434 --> 07:07.618
It's him.

07:09.871 --> 07:12.573
Hello.

07:12.575 --> 07:14.158
Well, I see.

07:14.160 --> 07:15.960
Yes.

07:15.962 --> 07:18.779
All right, we can come get you.

07:18.781 --> 07:20.614
Yeah, well, see you soon.

07:20.616 --> 07:22.616
Bye.
Where is he?

07:22.618 --> 07:24.085
The third floor landing.

07:24.087 --> 07:27.255
The poor old guy's been walking
up the stairs for half an hour.

07:31.009 --> 07:32.643
It's really you.

07:37.399 --> 07:39.483
Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry.

07:39.485 --> 07:41.819
We should've told you
about the broken elevator.

07:41.821 --> 07:43.738
I agree.

07:45.424 --> 07:49.160
Professor Proton,
it's an honor to meet you.

07:49.162 --> 07:51.145
Just-just call me Arthur.

07:51.147 --> 07:53.331
Leonard...

07:55.117 --> 07:56.367
...you hear that?

07:56.369 --> 07:57.568
Professor Proton said

07:57.570 --> 07:59.503
I should call him Arthur.

07:59.505 --> 08:01.505
That means we're friends.

08:01.507 --> 08:03.007
No.

08:03.009 --> 08:07.161
A friend would've-would've
told me about the elevator.

08:09.364 --> 08:11.432
Look at me.

08:13.168 --> 08:15.553
I can get as close
to you as I want

08:15.555 --> 08:18.306
without my mom saying
it's going to ruin my eyes.

08:21.777 --> 08:24.478
Is, uh, is he dangerous?

08:26.064 --> 08:28.399
Actually,
he's a genius.

08:28.401 --> 08:30.951
I am.

08:30.953 --> 08:34.688
Th-That doesn't answer
my question.

08:34.690 --> 08:37.291
Mr. Jeffries,
I'm-I'm Leonard.

08:37.293 --> 08:39.126
This is my
girlfriend, Penny.

08:39.128 --> 08:40.193
Hi.

08:40.196 --> 08:43.297
Hello.

08:44.383 --> 08:46.533
Well, I hope I haven't kept

08:46.535 --> 08:49.720
the kids waiting too long
for-for the show.

08:49.722 --> 08:51.505
Oh, no,
there are no kids.

08:51.507 --> 08:53.174
No, the-the show's for me.

08:54.542 --> 08:57.595
Come on. I'll race ya...

08:57.597 --> 08:58.979
Arthur.

09:02.734 --> 09:06.387
Is the, is the blonde girl
really your-your girlfriend?

09:06.389 --> 09:07.688
Yes, sir.

09:07.690 --> 09:10.074
You're the genius.

09:29.532 --> 09:32.067
So, do you do a lot
of appearances like this?

09:32.069 --> 09:33.835
It-It's hard to say.

09:33.837 --> 09:37.072
I'm-I'm still trying
to figure out what...

09:37.074 --> 09:40.425
what-what this is.

09:41.677 --> 09:43.678
We just wanted
to hang out with you

09:43.680 --> 09:45.764
and maybe learn
a little about your life.

09:45.766 --> 09:49.584
Well, there-there really isn't
too much to tell.

09:49.586 --> 09:52.521
After the TV show
was-was canceled,

09:52.523 --> 09:54.139
nobody in the scientific world

09:54.141 --> 09:56.525
would, uh, would take me
seriously.

09:56.527 --> 09:57.542
So I was forced

09:57.544 --> 10:00.779
to do these, uh,
children's parties

10:00.781 --> 10:03.448
to-to make a living.

10:03.450 --> 10:04.900
That's too bad.

10:04.902 --> 10:08.103
But still, working with kids--
it must be rewarding.

10:08.105 --> 10:11.156
You-you get bit a lot.

10:12.358 --> 10:15.276
Let me see
if-if I have this straight.

10:15.995 --> 10:18.463
You-you two are-are physicists,

10:18.465 --> 10:22.100
and-and you,
and you want me

10:22.102 --> 10:26.188
to do a children's...
science show?

10:26.190 --> 10:28.557
Yes.

10:29.542 --> 10:30.959
And if there's time,

10:30.961 --> 10:33.728
take 12 pictures with us
in seasonal clothing.

10:39.902 --> 10:41.336
You know,

10:41.338 --> 10:42.687
I'm a real scientist.

10:42.689 --> 10:46.408
I-I have a PhD
from Cornell University.

10:46.410 --> 10:47.409
Yeah, that's great.

10:47.411 --> 10:48.860
Did you bring
your puppet?

10:49.729 --> 10:53.231
No, no.

10:53.233 --> 10:56.701
I-I hate that puppet.

10:56.703 --> 10:59.004
Oh, no.

10:59.006 --> 11:01.323
How could anybody hate

11:01.325 --> 11:04.092
Gino the Neutrino?

11:04.094 --> 11:05.760
It's nice, huh?

11:05.762 --> 11:07.679
I got him for
20 bucks on eBay.

11:07.681 --> 11:10.331
Including a-shipping!

11:12.268 --> 11:15.437
I'm... I'm
awake, right?

11:18.691 --> 11:21.443
Th-This is happening?

11:24.280 --> 11:25.647
Cinnamon!

11:25.649 --> 11:27.182
Cinnamon!

11:27.184 --> 11:29.201
You know, maybe she doesn't
recognize her name

11:29.203 --> 11:31.820
because of Raj's accent.

11:31.822 --> 11:33.188
Good thinking.

11:33.190 --> 11:36.658
Cinnamon, come to Daddy!

11:37.793 --> 11:39.211
Cinnamon!

11:39.213 --> 11:41.663
Where are you,
my little lamb chop?

11:42.531 --> 11:43.582
Nice.

11:43.584 --> 11:45.217
Thanks.

11:45.219 --> 11:47.869
When this all blows over,
remember that voice.

11:47.871 --> 11:50.472
It's kind of a turn-on.

11:51.340 --> 11:53.808
It turns you on
when I sound like Raj?

11:56.812 --> 11:59.898
Cinnamon!

12:01.067 --> 12:04.502
Okay, as-as I put
the egg on top,

12:04.504 --> 12:07.522
and-and the
flame goes out

12:07.524 --> 12:10.325
and-and the air pressure
decreases

12:10.327 --> 12:11.860
in-in the flask,

12:11.862 --> 12:15.297
what do you think will happen?

12:15.299 --> 12:16.698
I think I know.

12:16.700 --> 12:18.333
It's gonna get
sucked in.

12:19.235 --> 12:21.836
It's going to
get sucked in.

12:21.838 --> 12:24.539
Okay, I didn't know.

12:28.377 --> 12:29.878
Yes!

12:31.464 --> 12:33.798
See, I'm not
a scientist like them.

12:34.650 --> 12:37.052
I-I figured that out.

12:37.054 --> 12:40.355
Uh, potato clock.
Do potato clock.

12:40.357 --> 12:41.439
What's that?

12:41.441 --> 12:45.227
I-I power a clock
with a, with a potato.

12:45.229 --> 12:46.728
Shut up!

12:46.730 --> 12:48.530
You can do that?

12:50.816 --> 12:52.117
I mean...

12:52.119 --> 12:54.986
wouldn't that solve
the world's energy crisis?

12:57.290 --> 12:59.724
No.

13:00.876 --> 13:02.544
Look, guys,

13:02.546 --> 13:04.479
keep your money.
I-I think, uh...

13:04.481 --> 13:06.214
I-I think I'm done.

13:06.216 --> 13:07.749
What-what's wrong?

13:07.751 --> 13:09.284
Is she upsetting you?

13:09.286 --> 13:11.703
Because I can
make her go away.

13:11.705 --> 13:16.374
No, sh-she's the only reason
I've-I've stayed this long.

13:18.177 --> 13:19.561
Then what is it?

13:19.563 --> 13:21.012
I don't know.

13:21.014 --> 13:22.797
I think I'm just...

13:22.799 --> 13:25.300
I-I just,
I just don't want to be

13:25.302 --> 13:27.852
Professor Proton anymore.

13:27.854 --> 13:30.355
Well, how can you say that?

13:30.357 --> 13:32.741
Professor Proton's the best.

13:32.743 --> 13:35.777
What-what has it ever gotten me?

13:35.779 --> 13:38.613
I mean, I'm-I'm an 83-year-old
man who has...

13:38.615 --> 13:42.500
potatoes in-in his suitcase.

13:42.502 --> 13:45.537
Other scientists think-think
I'm a joke.

13:45.539 --> 13:46.671
And the...

13:46.673 --> 13:52.377
the puppeteer who did,
who did Gino...

13:52.379 --> 13:55.964
well, he also...

13:55.966 --> 13:58.433
did my wife.

14:02.972 --> 14:04.406
Mr. Jeffries,

14:04.408 --> 14:06.641
I need to show you something.

14:09.562 --> 14:11.446
I'm sorry to hear
about your troubles.

14:11.448 --> 14:12.731
Uh, thanks.

14:12.733 --> 14:14.032
But if you don't mind

14:14.034 --> 14:16.351
me asking,
uh, the potato clock--

14:16.353 --> 14:17.869
how does it work?

14:18.821 --> 14:22.941
Is it a trick clock
or a trick potato?

14:27.213 --> 14:30.632
Wh-What do you two talk about?

14:36.605 --> 14:40.225
I wrote a fan letter to you
when I was a child in Texas,

14:40.227 --> 14:44.979
and you sent this autographed
picture back to me.

14:44.981 --> 14:47.315
Do you remember that?

14:47.317 --> 14:49.601
I'll-I'll give you a hint:

14:49.603 --> 14:53.688
I have a bracelet
with my own address on it.

14:55.324 --> 14:57.575
Well, anyway, um,

14:57.577 --> 14:59.694
you may find this
hard to believe,

14:59.696 --> 15:02.664
but I didn't have
any friends growing up.

15:03.516 --> 15:05.917
No, I-I get that.

15:08.220 --> 15:11.539
But, um, I
did have you.

15:11.541 --> 15:13.925
And every
day at 4:00,

15:13.927 --> 15:16.594
you'd come to my
house on Channel 68,

15:16.596 --> 15:18.680
and we'd do
science together.

15:18.682 --> 15:21.132
If it hadn't
been for you,

15:21.134 --> 15:22.967
well, who knows what
would've become of me?

15:22.969 --> 15:25.687
You know? Instead of a
world-class physicist,

15:25.689 --> 15:29.140
I could've wound
up as a-a hobo.

15:29.142 --> 15:31.609
Or a surgeon.

15:32.478 --> 15:34.612
I bet there are
important discoveries

15:34.614 --> 15:35.980
being made every day

15:35.982 --> 15:39.484
because you inspired millions
of kids to pursue science.

15:39.486 --> 15:41.936
In a way, their discoveries
are your discoveries.

15:41.938 --> 15:43.071
Yeah, it's true.

15:43.073 --> 15:44.122
A generation

15:44.124 --> 15:45.473
of young scientists

15:45.475 --> 15:47.575
are standing on your shoulders.

15:48.644 --> 15:50.161
Well, thank-thank you, guys.

15:50.163 --> 15:53.498
That... that-that means a lot.

15:53.500 --> 15:57.218
Well, it's important you know
how much you mean to us.

15:57.220 --> 15:58.670
Uh-oh.

15:58.672 --> 16:00.672
Arthur, are you okay?

16:00.674 --> 16:03.958
I'm having a...

16:03.960 --> 16:06.177
problem with
my pacemaker.

16:06.179 --> 16:07.846
I'll-I'll call
for help.

16:07.848 --> 16:11.015
Any chance we could
plug it into the potato?

16:15.771 --> 16:17.939
No.

16:28.985 --> 16:31.085
Hello?

16:31.087 --> 16:33.388
What do you mean,
you found my dog?

16:33.390 --> 16:36.441
She's with my friends.

16:36.443 --> 16:38.659
Is she okay?

16:38.661 --> 16:39.878
Oh, thank you.

16:39.880 --> 16:41.963
Uh, just text me your address;
I'm on my way.

16:41.965 --> 16:44.098
Oh, and if she's hungry,
go ahead and feed her.

16:44.100 --> 16:46.267
But do not give her
anything starchy.

16:46.269 --> 16:48.219
She's having risotto for dinner.

16:50.773 --> 16:52.223
Your vitals are stable,

16:52.225 --> 16:54.893
but let's take you in
for some tests just to be safe.

16:54.895 --> 16:56.611
You want one of us to go
with you in the ambulance?

16:56.613 --> 16:58.863
I'll do it!

16:58.865 --> 17:01.566
He's not a relative,
he's not allowed, right?

17:01.568 --> 17:03.401
No, that's not a rule.
He can go.

17:03.403 --> 17:05.619
Oh, yeah!

17:05.622 --> 17:07.739
I can't catch a break today.

17:09.208 --> 17:11.626
We'll pack up your stuff
and meet you at the hospital.

17:11.627 --> 17:13.627
I'm sorry
things turned out this way.

17:13.630 --> 17:16.464
Well, at-at this point,
I'm just...

17:16.465 --> 17:19.717
glad someone's carrying me
down the stairs.

17:23.255 --> 17:25.256
Met my childhood hero,

17:25.258 --> 17:27.008
now I get to ride
in an ambulance.

17:27.010 --> 17:29.260
Boy, if we can get him
to do that calendar,

17:29.262 --> 17:31.429
this'll be the best day ever.

17:33.849 --> 17:36.734
Can't believe
we lost her.

17:36.736 --> 17:37.769
What was I thinking?

17:37.771 --> 17:39.654
I'd be a terrible mom.

17:39.656 --> 17:41.356
Well, maybe with the first one.

17:41.358 --> 17:42.723
But kids are like pancakes.

17:42.725 --> 17:44.993
The first one's
always a throwaway.

17:49.031 --> 17:50.832
How's this look?
It's fine.

17:50.834 --> 17:52.534
Where'd you get
that picture of her?

17:52.536 --> 17:53.668
It's not her.

17:53.670 --> 17:56.871
I just Googled
"foo-foo little dogs."

17:58.174 --> 18:00.608
It's Raj. Stay quiet.

18:01.677 --> 18:02.894
Hey!

18:02.896 --> 18:04.078
Bad timing.

18:04.080 --> 18:06.431
Bernadette just took Cinnamon
out for a walk.

18:06.433 --> 18:08.299
Hmm. Interesting.

18:08.301 --> 18:11.336
Did they take a walk
down Liars' Lane?

18:12.171 --> 18:13.004
What?

18:13.006 --> 18:14.739
A lane frequented by liars.

18:14.741 --> 18:16.591
Like you, you big liar!

18:18.394 --> 18:19.994
You have her?

18:19.996 --> 18:22.146
Oh, thank God
she's okay.

18:22.148 --> 18:23.948
Well, I trusted you,
and you let me down.

18:23.950 --> 18:26.651
The poor thing's been shaking
for hours.

18:26.653 --> 18:27.902
I'm really sorry.

18:27.904 --> 18:29.704
Hang on, you've
had her for hours?

18:29.706 --> 18:31.306
Yes. I picked her up,

18:31.308 --> 18:34.042
and then we both went for
massages to try and calm down.

18:34.044 --> 18:36.077
And then we got Pinkberry.

18:36.829 --> 18:38.329
So you knew
she was okay,

18:38.331 --> 18:40.732
and you couldn't pick up
the phone to tell ?

18:40.734 --> 18:42.750
Well, I-I thought about...

18:42.752 --> 18:44.252
Don't "well"
me, mister!

18:44.254 --> 18:45.503
We've been
worried sick!

18:45.505 --> 18:47.422
She could have been
dead for all we knew!

18:47.424 --> 18:49.457
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

18:49.459 --> 18:51.125
Sorry. I-I just...

18:51.127 --> 18:52.093
Sorry's not
good enough!

18:52.095 --> 18:53.728
Maybe you need
to take some time

18:53.730 --> 18:55.813
and think about
what you've done!

18:59.385 --> 19:00.852
Nice guilt trip.

19:01.855 --> 19:04.822
You are gonna be
an amazing mom.

19:15.801 --> 19:19.253
♪ Soft kitty, warm kitty

19:19.255 --> 19:21.672
♪ Little ball of fur

19:24.593 --> 19:27.862
♪ Happy kitty, sleepy kitty

19:27.864 --> 19:30.865
♪ Purr, purr, purr.

19:30.867 --> 19:32.116
Thank you, Sheldon.

19:32.118 --> 19:33.701
That-that was very nice.

19:33.703 --> 19:34.736
Want me to sing it again?

19:34.738 --> 19:36.621
No.

19:38.407 --> 19:42.543
The fourth, the fourth time
was-was the charm.

19:42.545 --> 19:44.662
There anything
I can get for you?

19:44.664 --> 19:46.330
Some apple juice?

19:46.332 --> 19:47.632
Uh, some Jell-O?

19:47.634 --> 19:49.000
No. No, thank you.

19:49.002 --> 19:50.418
But I-I do...

19:50.420 --> 19:52.553
I do have a favor to-to ask.

19:52.555 --> 19:53.838
Name it.

19:53.840 --> 19:55.256
Well, I'm-I'm booked to do

19:55.258 --> 19:57.475
a children's party tomorrow,

19:57.477 --> 20:01.462
and, um, frankly I, you know,
I-I don't feel up to it.

20:01.464 --> 20:03.264
Oh, you're not.

20:03.266 --> 20:05.683
You look awful.

20:07.236 --> 20:09.020
Th-Thank you.

20:10.773 --> 20:12.290
Anyway, uh...

20:12.292 --> 20:16.244
I mean, you know my act
better than... anybody.

20:16.246 --> 20:17.278
I was, I was hoping

20:17.280 --> 20:18.246
that maybe, you know,

20:18.248 --> 20:19.647
maybe you'd fill in for me.

20:19.649 --> 20:21.866
Wha... Are you saying

20:21.868 --> 20:24.719
that you want me to be
Professor Proton?

20:24.721 --> 20:25.920
Yeah.

20:25.922 --> 20:28.172
Oh, my.

20:28.174 --> 20:29.757
What an honor.

20:29.759 --> 20:32.794
Oh, this is like being asked
to ascend Mount Olympus

20:32.796 --> 20:35.029
and dine with the gods.

20:35.031 --> 20:40.535
Or a... Korean family
in Alhambra.

20:42.003 --> 20:44.939
But they'll know I'm not you.

20:44.941 --> 20:47.108
Should I call myself...

20:47.110 --> 20:49.310
Professor Proton, Jr.?

20:49.312 --> 20:51.362
Sounds great.

20:51.364 --> 20:55.116
So, in a way...

20:55.118 --> 20:57.285
it's like I'm your son.

20:57.287 --> 20:59.904
What-Whatever.

21:03.625 --> 21:05.893
Father.

21:07.746 --> 21:09.497
Sure, what the hell?
