<i>Previously on "Chasing Life"...</i>

00:04.285 --> 00:07.195
- I have a boyfriend!
- You're gonna love me.

00:07.825 --> 00:10.358
I've got 3 or 4 months
to live if I'm lucky.

00:10.428 --> 00:12.095
Worrying about the future

00:12.342 --> 00:13.342
is not living.

00:13.382 --> 00:15.715
It's a party, and the door's open.

00:17.191 --> 00:18.191
Greer!

00:18.315 --> 00:19.315
Just leave.

00:19.418 --> 00:22.273
So my dad cheated on my mum?

00:22.298 --> 00:24.893
I didn't agree that he
should keep this a secret.

00:24.964 --> 00:26.740
He just didn't wanna hurt you, guys.

00:26.834 --> 00:28.264
He wanted to protect you.

00:28.289 --> 00:30.429
I'm making an appointment
to see a fertility doctor.

00:30.451 --> 00:33.300
Your life is more important than
you having biological children.

00:33.324 --> 00:35.625
That is not your choice to make!

00:39.549 --> 00:41.200
_

00:41.284 --> 00:43.975
How often do you have
intercourse with your partner?

00:44.341 --> 00:46.752
Uh... God, I hope this doctor's a chick.

00:46.777 --> 00:49.281
And I'm happy to report
that I have intercourse

00:49.316 --> 00:50.930
- a few times a week now.
- Oh!

00:50.955 --> 00:52.471
Whenever my partner's roommate isn't

00:52.493 --> 00:55.323
five feet away yelling about
how kale isn't a real vegetable.

00:55.342 --> 00:58.088
Seriously? The roommate gets
that worked up about kale?

00:58.144 --> 00:59.573
Among other things.

00:59.855 --> 01:02.034
Would you consider your
partner good in bed?

01:02.824 --> 01:04.712
Yeah, it's not on there. I'm just curious.

01:04.750 --> 01:06.304
He looks like he would be.

01:07.028 --> 01:09.895
How satisfied are you in your
relationship, if applicable?

01:09.933 --> 01:11.263
I mean, it's sort of applicable,

01:11.318 --> 01:12.718
I'm in a relationship, but

01:12.762 --> 01:16.018
I don't know if the guy I'm dating
is the guy I wanna have kids with.

01:16.129 --> 01:18.953
Not that I wanna have kids
anytime soon, because I'm 24.

01:18.978 --> 01:21.449
I know, you should be sitting
around some crappy apartment,

01:21.477 --> 01:23.488
getting drunk and watching
videos of people twerking.

01:23.513 --> 01:26.924
Not getting ready for chemo
and harvesting your eggs.

01:27.286 --> 01:30.321
So which one of you is
gonna carry the baby?

01:30.916 --> 01:33.401
We are having the hardest time deciding.

01:33.426 --> 01:35.116
I have the more demanding job.

01:35.141 --> 01:37.383
But I can't even keep a goldfish alive.

01:38.626 --> 01:39.759
We hear you.

01:39.784 --> 01:42.429
I mean, she's the more nurturing one,
but I have the child-bearing hips.

01:42.454 --> 01:45.033
Aww.

01:45.421 --> 01:46.971
Aww.

01:49.545 --> 01:52.240
Normal in vitro usually
takes two to three weeks,

01:52.265 --> 01:54.266
but since you need to
start your chemo soon,

01:54.291 --> 01:55.714
there are some other options.

01:55.739 --> 01:58.878
- Let's see, you're 24, right?
- Yeah.

01:59.183 --> 02:01.690
Wow, you're so young. I'm sorry.

02:02.321 --> 02:04.848
But the good news there is
that we'll probably have success

02:04.873 --> 02:06.324
with natural cycle in vitro.

02:06.349 --> 02:08.240
Which means no hormone shots.

02:08.264 --> 02:09.764
Thank God. She's moody enough.

02:09.795 --> 02:11.048
And it's faster.

02:11.073 --> 02:12.712
Since you already started your cycle,

02:12.737 --> 02:15.090
- it'll take about 10 days.
- Cool.

02:15.276 --> 02:17.377
Never been so happy to
start my cycle before.

02:17.599 --> 02:19.265
And you're aware of the cost?

02:19.446 --> 02:21.224
Yeah, I think my insurance will cover it.

02:21.373 --> 02:23.436
Unfortunately it won't.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.915
Egg freezing is considered
an elective procedure

02:25.940 --> 02:27.470
not a medical necessity.

02:27.495 --> 02:28.896
So we'll pay out-of-pocket.

02:29.143 --> 02:31.116
- We?
- You don't have any money.

02:31.141 --> 02:33.505
So we'll do a kickstarter. How much?

02:34.232 --> 02:35.668
Around 5,000.

02:40.157 --> 02:41.831
I'm gonna have to sell my first-born

02:41.856 --> 02:43.229
to pay for my first-born.

03:11.864 --> 03:13.255
If I'd known you were coming home,

03:13.280 --> 03:14.324
i would have made more food.

03:14.349 --> 03:16.121
Can you believe it? Grandma cooked.

03:16.146 --> 03:17.620
I thought you hated cooking.

03:17.645 --> 03:19.613
I do. I still remember the day

03:19.638 --> 03:21.164
they invented the microwave.

03:21.254 --> 03:23.122
Happiest day of my life.

03:23.226 --> 03:26.815
Except for the day you were
all born, and blah blah blah.

03:27.141 --> 03:29.109
Why don't you join us?
There's still some left.

03:29.175 --> 03:31.418
Uh, I'm okay. I had something at work.

03:31.443 --> 03:34.124
Well, sit with us for a minute.

03:34.313 --> 03:35.831
I'd love to hear about your day.

03:36.566 --> 03:37.872
How... how was it?

03:38.086 --> 03:40.952
You mean my appointment
with the fertility doctor?

03:40.977 --> 03:42.744
You really wanna hear about that?

03:42.817 --> 03:44.399
Of course.

03:44.615 --> 03:46.736
If... you wanna tell me.

03:47.022 --> 03:48.030
Okay.

03:48.381 --> 03:50.097
Well, it looks like we're gonna try

03:50.122 --> 03:52.113
natural cycle in vitro.

03:52.353 --> 03:53.892
So it'll take about 10 days.

03:54.233 --> 03:56.134
10 days. Okay.

03:56.225 --> 03:58.854
Or... well, you said "about 10 days."

03:58.879 --> 04:00.402
Do you think it might be longer than that?

04:00.427 --> 04:01.618
I don't know, mom.

04:01.643 --> 04:02.643
Whatever it is, it's fine.

04:02.668 --> 04:04.569
It's your decision. I...

04:04.820 --> 04:07.384
Just get me the details when you know them

04:07.409 --> 04:08.998
so we can figure out
when you're gonna start...

04:09.023 --> 04:10.821
Chemo? Yes, I know.

04:10.846 --> 04:13.271
I haven't forgotten.
That's why I'm doing this.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.622
Right after I find
five-grand to pay for it.

04:15.944 --> 04:17.983
- Whoa!
- I know. It sucks.

04:18.007 --> 04:20.908
But I'll handle it since
this was my decision.

04:22.282 --> 04:25.084
I have to go change for
my cancer support group.

04:25.165 --> 04:28.190
You know, 'cause I need support.

04:38.021 --> 04:40.641
So I was supposed to start chemo today,

04:40.882 --> 04:43.724
but I saw a fertility doctor instead.

04:45.104 --> 04:47.127
Add that to a list of
things I didn't think I'd say

04:47.152 --> 04:50.392
till I was at least 40.

04:50.687 --> 04:52.565
I don't even know how I'm gonna afford it.

04:52.590 --> 04:55.263
Or if I'm even gonna live
long enough to have kids.

04:55.297 --> 04:57.767
Which is probably why my
mom doesn't want me to do it,

04:57.792 --> 05:00.781
but, I mean, I have to at least try.

05:01.270 --> 05:03.405
What am I fighting for if

05:03.439 --> 05:05.783
all the things I was
looking forward to in life

05:05.808 --> 05:06.975
can't happen anymore?

05:07.634 --> 05:09.194
Now that this is a possibility,

05:09.219 --> 05:10.412
I feel like there's some hope.

05:10.446 --> 05:12.313
You know, like a...

05:12.348 --> 05:15.917
lifeline to my future, or something.

05:16.634 --> 05:19.152
Who am I?

05:19.199 --> 05:21.188
I swear I never used to
say things like "lifeline

05:21.213 --> 05:23.304
- to my future" before I got cancer.

05:23.516 --> 05:26.261
I used to make fun of people for
saying things like "headspace,"

05:26.295 --> 05:29.764
and now I catch myself saying things like

05:30.132 --> 05:33.034
"afterlife" and "my legacy."

05:33.961 --> 05:36.307
Have you told the boyfriend yet?

05:37.173 --> 05:40.074
No. About any of it.

05:40.476 --> 05:43.611
But I have to. I'm going to... tomorrow.

05:45.080 --> 05:46.047
How did you guys do it?

05:46.081 --> 05:47.182
Were any of you in relationships

05:47.216 --> 05:48.349
when you got diagnosed?

05:48.384 --> 05:50.084
When I told my boyfriend I had cancer,

05:50.119 --> 05:52.120
he ran away that same day.

05:52.154 --> 05:55.123
With a stripper he found online.

05:55.270 --> 05:57.192
Yeah, joke's on him,
though. That guy had herpes.

05:58.227 --> 06:00.061
At least cancer isn't contagious.

06:00.095 --> 06:02.779
I didn't know that he was a stripper.

06:03.065 --> 06:04.999
I've always wanted to try that.

06:05.538 --> 06:06.774
What?

06:06.799 --> 06:09.767
It sounds fun.

06:10.139 --> 06:12.574
It's gonna be hard no
matter how you tell him.

06:12.599 --> 06:14.275
But you gotta do it.

06:14.672 --> 06:17.111
You'll feel better once
it's all out in the open.

06:17.369 --> 06:19.570
That's when people show their true colors.

06:20.049 --> 06:21.745
I mean, why do you think I'm single?

06:24.053 --> 06:25.086
Hey.

06:25.120 --> 06:26.428
I need to talk to you.

06:26.453 --> 06:29.157
No, April, I will not father your child.

06:29.191 --> 06:31.226
I'm really flattered. Thanks.

06:31.377 --> 06:32.856
It's a work thing.

06:33.162 --> 06:35.013
You're wasting precious time on work.

06:35.038 --> 06:36.649
Seize the day already. Ahem.

06:36.674 --> 06:39.033
Or in my case, seize in
the middle of the day.

06:39.068 --> 06:40.101
Ha.

06:40.135 --> 06:42.403
A little seizure humor for you.

06:43.007 --> 06:45.909
So I just spent all day

06:45.934 --> 06:47.664
reading about the St.
Christopher's society.

06:47.689 --> 06:49.321
They've been getting in
a lot of trouble lately.

06:49.346 --> 06:50.884
At a chapter in north Carolina,

06:50.909 --> 06:52.777
the members cyber-bullied a girl on campus

06:52.811 --> 06:54.476
until she had a total nervous breakdown.

06:54.765 --> 06:56.666
Ah, St. Christopher's.

06:56.749 --> 06:59.684
Your dad's one of the founding members.

07:00.424 --> 07:02.453
And you wanna do a story on it?

07:02.888 --> 07:04.246
Only if you're okay with it.

07:04.271 --> 07:06.205
I mean, I know you have issues with
your dad, but he's still your...

07:06.230 --> 07:09.404
Look, Bruce has done plenty of things

07:09.429 --> 07:11.497
I find morally questionable...

07:11.608 --> 07:13.375
And the voting public has a right to know.

07:13.432 --> 07:15.567
So...

07:15.593 --> 07:17.327
Can I have your blessing?

07:18.478 --> 07:20.022
Yes, you have my blessing.

07:20.310 --> 07:22.444
Go and write your big story.

07:22.469 --> 07:23.732
I hope it makes it in the paper.

07:23.846 --> 07:25.714
- Thanks.
- And I hope that

07:25.739 --> 07:27.313
it makes you as happy as you think it will.

07:27.338 --> 07:29.858
Because if not, well...

07:30.821 --> 07:32.279
Then what?

07:37.729 --> 07:39.630
So, how you guys feeling?

07:41.827 --> 07:44.154
He was only off by one number.

07:44.179 --> 07:45.794
He almost picked it, actually,

07:45.865 --> 07:48.876
but at the last second, his
wife said that they should pick

07:48.901 --> 07:50.448
- their son's birthday...
- Paul.

07:50.550 --> 07:52.451
Would you read a story about someone

07:52.476 --> 07:53.917
almost winning the powerball?

07:54.446 --> 07:56.280
It was for 75 mil...

07:57.823 --> 07:59.128
I'll keep thinking.

07:59.161 --> 08:00.854
Is this what happens when I go out of town?

08:00.879 --> 08:03.815
Because, so far, my daughter's pony blog

08:03.849 --> 08:05.643
has harder hitting stories than this.

08:05.668 --> 08:07.174
You're absolutely right, Lawrence.

08:07.199 --> 08:08.720
And I will definitely have

08:08.754 --> 08:10.688
a tutorial with our
writers about what passes

08:10.722 --> 08:11.829
for a story here.

08:11.977 --> 08:13.756
Can I pitch something?

08:13.781 --> 08:16.358
It's not for "ask Mallory," but
I think it's totally newsworthy.

08:16.383 --> 08:18.351
Now my sex columnist is pitching a story

08:18.376 --> 08:19.410
before my reporters?

08:19.698 --> 08:22.294
The apocalypse has officially arrived.

08:22.327 --> 08:25.262
So, I have a source at
the municipal courthouse

08:25.287 --> 08:28.130
who informed me that
a woman in south Hadley

08:28.155 --> 08:30.510
is being sued by her ex-boyfriend

08:30.809 --> 08:31.943
for sperm-napping.

08:31.977 --> 08:33.910
Now I remember why

08:33.946 --> 08:36.154
I don't let sex columnists write stories.

08:36.179 --> 08:38.080
No, seriously, it's a thing.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.693
It's when someone steals
another person's sperm

08:40.719 --> 08:42.753
to accidentally get knocked up.

08:42.788 --> 08:44.755
I mean, planning to have a baby

08:44.790 --> 08:46.454
behind your boyfriend's back?

08:46.826 --> 08:47.859
Who does that?

08:48.688 --> 08:49.927
All right.

08:49.962 --> 08:52.444
Sounds like it's worth exploring, Mallory.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.218
Anyone else?

08:54.391 --> 08:56.493
Um, I have a pitch.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.501
It's about the St. Christopher's society.

08:58.526 --> 09:00.694
We don't do stories
about fraternities here.

09:00.719 --> 09:02.387
St. Christopher's isn't a frat.

09:02.412 --> 09:04.668
It's a rich kids' club. Like really rich.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.485
To get in, they make you buy a
non-refundable ticket to Tokyo

09:07.510 --> 09:09.351
and rip it up just to prove that you can.

09:09.458 --> 09:12.160
Bruce Hendrie is one
of the founding members,

09:12.185 --> 09:13.770
which is rather inconsistent with his whole

09:13.795 --> 09:15.220
"man of the people" campaign.

09:15.245 --> 09:17.479
Run with it.

09:18.223 --> 09:20.087
Raquel will supervise.

09:20.859 --> 09:22.860
If we end up running the story,

09:23.466 --> 09:25.630
could be your first byline.

09:40.349 --> 09:41.482
Hey.

09:41.655 --> 09:42.954
Hey.

09:43.305 --> 09:45.506
So many adventures to choose from.

09:45.884 --> 09:48.416
Did you see the history
club's going to Gettysburg?

09:48.441 --> 09:49.885
Could they be more cliche?

09:50.214 --> 09:52.743
I'm kind of in the
middle of eco club stuff.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.316
Okay...

09:57.524 --> 09:58.963
I just joined eco club.

09:58.997 --> 10:01.374
Now can we talk? It's club business.

10:01.430 --> 10:03.192
Seriously, I'm busy.

10:03.280 --> 10:05.613
I'm like organising our whole trip.

10:06.340 --> 10:07.566
Okay, fine.

10:09.745 --> 10:13.551
Look, I just wanted to say I'm sorry
about what happened the other night.

10:15.095 --> 10:17.416
That was totally weird.

10:18.066 --> 10:19.066
Weird?

10:19.176 --> 10:20.176
Yeah.

10:21.577 --> 10:23.577
I don't know, I just feel bad.

10:25.121 --> 10:26.516
It's fine. It's a party.

10:26.541 --> 10:28.642
People hook up. That's what happens.

10:34.196 --> 10:36.131
Or was there something else?

10:37.788 --> 10:38.846
No.

10:49.478 --> 10:52.987
So, you're about to get your first byline.

10:53.067 --> 10:55.947
Don't jinx me. It has
to get by Raquel first.

10:55.972 --> 10:58.219
I'm not worried. You got a
way of getting what you want.

10:58.338 --> 11:00.774
I mean, you get a story
from Leo Hendrie one week,

11:00.799 --> 11:03.028
the next week you take his dad down.

11:03.192 --> 11:04.259
He must be pissed.

11:04.293 --> 11:06.194
Actually, Leo's fine with it.

11:06.228 --> 11:09.397
I guess he feels bad about making
me look like an idiot last time.

11:09.432 --> 11:11.995
Man, that guy pulled a total 180 for you.

11:13.235 --> 11:14.235
Dominic.

11:14.768 --> 11:16.690
Have you heard of, um...

11:17.273 --> 11:19.307
Deaf punk?

11:19.341 --> 11:21.065
Daft punk?

11:22.111 --> 11:23.278
That makes even less sense.

11:23.312 --> 11:24.938
But you know what that is?

11:24.963 --> 11:26.181
Yeah, they're a French group.

11:26.215 --> 11:28.209
- I love them.
- And how do you feel about France?

11:28.244 --> 11:29.927
And the rest of Europe? You love that too?

11:29.952 --> 11:31.519
Yeah. I love Europe.

11:32.340 --> 11:34.189
I just got a call from
a friend at random house

11:34.223 --> 11:35.613
who's looking for a rock journalist

11:35.638 --> 11:36.605
to go on tour with the band,

11:36.639 --> 11:38.640
and write a behind-the-scenes book.

11:38.675 --> 11:40.743
Having published authors on our staff

11:40.777 --> 11:42.611
can really drive up our readership.

11:42.645 --> 11:44.613
- Interested?
- Of course.

11:44.647 --> 11:47.616
Great. They're meeting
people immediately because...

11:47.650 --> 11:49.685
The tour starts the day after tomorrow.

11:49.719 --> 11:51.095
In Berlin.

11:51.308 --> 11:52.308
Four months on the road.

11:52.373 --> 11:53.521
Sound good?

11:53.810 --> 11:55.510
Sounds great.

11:56.107 --> 11:57.559
Good.

12:10.660 --> 12:13.158
Well, looks like dreams do come true.

12:13.183 --> 12:14.284
Oh, stop.

12:14.309 --> 12:16.176
It's not like I have the job yet.

12:16.201 --> 12:17.801
But you're interested, right?

12:17.834 --> 12:19.553
I mean, you just said you were.

12:19.578 --> 12:21.513
Well, yeah. I was on the spot.

12:21.538 --> 12:23.309
It was kinda hard to say "no" to Lawrence.

12:23.357 --> 12:24.639
That sounds sexual.

12:24.674 --> 12:26.247
Who said it isn't?

12:26.504 --> 12:29.199
This is kinda crazy timing.

12:29.224 --> 12:30.324
Yeah.

12:30.746 --> 12:31.813
But you'd be cool

12:31.848 --> 12:33.849
leaving Boston for four months?

12:33.883 --> 12:36.651
Hey, nothing's happened yet,
so let's not worry about it.

12:36.686 --> 12:38.007
Okay?

12:40.187 --> 12:41.729
Are we still on for dinner tonight?

12:42.483 --> 12:43.537
Yeah.

12:47.897 --> 12:50.699
I mean, I have a lot of my plate right now.

12:50.733 --> 12:52.866
And she keeps trying to act like

12:52.891 --> 12:54.703
she respects my decision,
but then she'll make

12:54.737 --> 12:56.905
these passive-aggressive comments.

12:56.939 --> 12:58.740
She obviously doesn't support me.

12:58.774 --> 13:00.709
Well, I'm sure Sara's scared.

13:00.743 --> 13:02.677
She wants you to start chemo now.

13:02.712 --> 13:06.416
I get that, but this is
really important to me.

13:06.479 --> 13:07.816
And it's fine if she disagrees,

13:07.850 --> 13:09.872
I just wish she would do
a better job of hiding it.

13:09.997 --> 13:13.688
You tell me that your mother's
not very good at hiding anxiety?

13:13.723 --> 13:15.690
I'm shocked.

13:15.725 --> 13:18.147
We will get through this.

13:18.728 --> 13:20.795
Thanks for saying "we."

13:20.830 --> 13:23.531
I've been feeling like I'm
all alone in this lately.

13:23.566 --> 13:25.533
Well, you're not alone. I'm there for you.

13:25.568 --> 13:27.669
But that's only because
you're one of my patients.

13:27.703 --> 13:29.804
You told me yourself that those
are the only people I care about.

13:30.139 --> 13:32.641
Actually, I'm not gonna be
your patient for much longer.

13:33.043 --> 13:34.876
So can I go back to not caring about you?

13:36.663 --> 13:39.447
- I'm sorry I said that.
- It's okay.

13:39.482 --> 13:42.617
You didn't know some of the
things you know now about your dad.

13:42.652 --> 13:45.720
Yeah, he put you in an impossible position.

13:45.755 --> 13:46.821
And believe me,

13:46.856 --> 13:48.490
he wanted to do the right thing,

13:48.524 --> 13:50.859
he just didn't know what that was.

13:52.662 --> 13:53.956
I could relate.

14:13.783 --> 14:15.583
What, you write this on
the train this morning?

14:15.618 --> 14:17.034
What's wrong with it?

14:17.336 --> 14:19.862
Your leading was weak, there
were tons of run-on sentences

14:19.887 --> 14:21.988
and the piece didn't quite have...

14:22.448 --> 14:23.481
How do I phrase this?

14:23.626 --> 14:26.154
- Just say it, Raquel.
- It has no point.

14:26.179 --> 14:28.606
You don't even get to the St.
Christopher's info until page two.

14:28.821 --> 14:29.864
Okay.

14:29.899 --> 14:33.159
Well, I can fix this.
Just give me some time.

14:33.184 --> 14:35.481
This story won't make it to
print unless I have it by five.

14:35.585 --> 14:36.681
It's already four, so...

14:36.955 --> 14:38.922
Good luck with that.

14:42.493 --> 14:45.294
These catfights just keep
getting better and better.

14:45.342 --> 14:46.748
It's really making my workday fly by.

14:46.782 --> 14:48.817
Not now, Danny. Please.

14:48.851 --> 14:50.852
Oh, that's good. Keep
channeling that anger.

14:50.886 --> 14:53.722
Maybe next time you can rip some
clothes off her or something.

14:55.891 --> 14:57.492
This is the part where
you're supposed to tell me

14:57.526 --> 14:58.660
how disgusting I am and then I have

14:58.694 --> 15:00.049
a really witty retort.

15:00.289 --> 15:01.556
What's happened to us, April?

15:01.581 --> 15:03.282
How the hell am I gonna get this done?!

15:03.411 --> 15:06.313
I have one hour to rewrite my entire story.

15:09.224 --> 15:11.285
Here. Take this.

15:11.540 --> 15:14.676
It's an inspirational playlist I
used to get through finals at Harvard.

15:14.710 --> 15:16.678
"Tribal fusion"?

15:16.712 --> 15:21.416
Just imagine you're a lion hunting a
cheetah, and that cheetah is Raquel.

15:22.243 --> 15:24.282
Cheetahs really are the sexiest animal.

16:15.738 --> 16:17.639
I incorporated all your notes.

16:19.090 --> 16:21.024
In an hour?

16:22.645 --> 16:24.612
Well, thanks for the opportunity.

16:26.782 --> 16:28.516
And I read somewhere that those things

16:28.551 --> 16:30.236
actually aren't that good for your back.

16:30.299 --> 16:32.267
I just wouldn't want you to hurt yourself.

16:40.696 --> 16:42.973
Can you read lips?

16:42.998 --> 16:45.082
Is there anything I can't do?

16:45.434 --> 16:46.956
I think it's brilliant.

16:46.981 --> 16:49.074
Um, but since it's my life's mission

16:49.099 --> 16:50.748
to prevent April Carver's
dreams from coming true,

16:50.773 --> 16:52.640
I say let's not run her piece.

16:52.675 --> 16:53.875
It would make her way too happy.

16:53.909 --> 16:56.411
I think you should wear
tighter skirts, Raquel.

17:08.557 --> 17:09.557
You look nervous.

17:10.490 --> 17:12.906
Uh, I can't even pretend that I'm not.

17:13.013 --> 17:14.981
Just... just rip off the band-aid.

17:15.939 --> 17:17.779
But this part's so fun.

17:20.736 --> 17:22.395
Congratulations.

17:24.540 --> 17:26.811
Oh, my God! Thank you!

17:28.711 --> 17:29.711
You okay?

17:29.745 --> 17:31.713
Yeah, no, I am. Sorry, I'm just...

17:31.747 --> 17:33.681
I... I wanna remember this.

17:33.716 --> 17:35.583
You'll forget about it
sooner than you think.

17:35.618 --> 17:37.619
You have a long career ahead of you.

17:41.016 --> 17:43.151
I'm gonna need this back.

17:43.592 --> 17:45.560
It's clearly more powerful than I thought.

17:51.934 --> 17:53.068
So, how does it feel?

17:53.102 --> 17:55.170
You've wanted a byline for how long?

17:55.204 --> 17:56.972
Since I was in utero.

17:57.412 --> 17:58.746
How much do you want for this?

17:59.030 --> 18:00.531
$5,000.

18:01.329 --> 18:03.642
Speaking of in utero,
I just figured I'd try

18:03.667 --> 18:05.206
to kill two birds with one stone.

18:05.267 --> 18:06.924
I'll take 10 bucks.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.186
Sorry, I didn't mean to
bring up the eggs thing.

18:11.220 --> 18:12.888
Back to celebrating.

18:13.666 --> 18:15.057
It's not that.

18:15.091 --> 18:16.892
It's Dominic.

18:17.368 --> 18:19.503
I was gonna tell him tonight that I'm sick,

18:19.528 --> 18:21.229
finally, so it'll stop torturing me.

18:21.264 --> 18:23.066
And why can't you still do that?

18:23.091 --> 18:25.109
Because if he gets that job offer...

18:25.575 --> 18:29.004
I don't know. I just know what a
huge deal that would be for him.

18:29.353 --> 18:31.693
I just don't want me being
sick to make him feel like he...

18:31.718 --> 18:34.309
It's his life. He can
make his own decisions.

18:34.343 --> 18:36.211
That's not fair for me to put that on him.

18:36.714 --> 18:38.947
We haven't been dating that long.

18:38.981 --> 18:41.588
I should at least wait until
he finds out about the job.

18:41.627 --> 18:43.985
One of the things I've always
admired about you is how much

18:44.020 --> 18:45.187
you care about the people in your life

18:45.221 --> 18:47.255
and, you know, what they need...

18:47.290 --> 18:49.024
But, dude, stop it already.

18:49.058 --> 18:50.892
You're the one who has cancer, okay?

18:50.927 --> 18:52.323
And all I hear you talk about is how

18:52.348 --> 18:54.749
everyone else is gonna feel
about it and deal with it.

18:54.774 --> 18:57.201
You've just gotta stop taking
care of people all the time, okay?

18:57.226 --> 19:00.102
Just figure out whatever's gonna
make you feel less stressed.

19:00.136 --> 19:02.104
Besides a refill.

19:15.527 --> 19:17.428
I'm not used to you and mom fighting.

19:17.538 --> 19:19.039
That's, like, supposed to be my job.

19:19.073 --> 19:20.173
We're not fighting, Bren.

19:20.208 --> 19:21.374
I'm just annoyed.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.201
I feel like I made my decision

19:24.226 --> 19:25.979
and she just doesn't accept it.

19:26.013 --> 19:27.113
But on the bright side,

19:27.148 --> 19:29.893
something awesome happened at work today.

19:29.964 --> 19:32.960
- What?
- I got my first solo byline.

19:33.015 --> 19:35.255
Oh, my God, really?!

19:35.602 --> 19:37.403
You're like a real reporter now.

19:37.437 --> 19:38.738
I know. It's crazy.

19:38.772 --> 19:40.573
I can't believe it's finally happening.

19:42.442 --> 19:44.310
With everything that's been going on

19:44.344 --> 19:46.312
and fighting with mom...

19:47.714 --> 19:49.726
Are you gonna celebrate?

19:50.223 --> 19:52.291
I have plans with Dominic tonight.

19:57.125 --> 19:59.510
_

19:59.619 --> 20:02.254
- Seriously?!
- What? What happened?

20:02.429 --> 20:04.666
They're pulling my article. I gotta go.

20:11.913 --> 20:13.560
What's all this?

20:14.374 --> 20:15.641
What's all what? I'm just reading.

20:15.676 --> 20:17.677
"Outsmart your cancer."

20:19.320 --> 20:21.546
"Surviving cancer."

20:21.884 --> 20:23.851
They're not all cancer books.

20:26.787 --> 20:29.988
"Steve Jobs biography."

20:30.862 --> 20:32.278
Hey.

20:32.492 --> 20:35.695
Why don't we go out tonight? I... I'm
sure there's some great movie out there

20:35.729 --> 20:38.631
about women and... And eating and praying

20:38.665 --> 20:40.633
and loving, you know? Your favorite.

20:40.658 --> 20:43.133
Not in the mood for
that, mom. I'm fine here.

20:44.169 --> 20:45.303
I'll get it.

20:48.635 --> 20:50.736
Hello, George.

20:56.650 --> 20:58.113
George, is everything okay?

20:58.138 --> 21:00.319
Yeah, everything's fine. Yeah, how are you?

21:00.354 --> 21:02.488
I'm...

21:02.522 --> 21:04.423
- I'm fine.
- Great.

21:04.458 --> 21:06.726
So I talked to April today.

21:06.760 --> 21:07.900
Oh.

21:07.925 --> 21:11.195
Well, I'm sure she has
plenty to say about me.

21:11.331 --> 21:13.466
Seems like you two are
not seeing eye to eye.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.264
I'd like to help out if I could.

21:15.289 --> 21:17.336
Well, I'd rather you
actually stay out of it.

21:17.371 --> 21:19.372
Our problems started after
our appointment with you.

21:19.406 --> 21:20.439
Well, Sara to be fair,

21:20.474 --> 21:22.341
you're the one who chose not to tell April

21:22.376 --> 21:23.576
about the risk of infertility.

21:23.610 --> 21:25.645
I'm well aware of my mistakes, thanks.

21:25.679 --> 21:28.547
So, George, you said you came over to help?

21:28.582 --> 21:30.267
Yeah, that's right.

21:30.751 --> 21:32.451
I know you've been dealing with a lot,

21:32.519 --> 21:35.454
but, um, I know a place that

21:35.489 --> 21:37.456
might help you.

21:45.666 --> 21:48.334
Hey, Dominic, uh, I'm gonna be late.

21:48.368 --> 21:49.435
I have to go back to the office.

21:49.469 --> 21:50.770
There's something going on with my story.

21:50.804 --> 21:52.772
I'll keep you posted.

22:03.684 --> 22:04.717
Now.

22:04.751 --> 22:07.286
Surprise!

22:10.724 --> 22:12.692
Happy byline, superstar!

22:26.456 --> 22:28.290
I can't believe you guys did this.

22:28.324 --> 22:30.292
- It was all Dominic.
- Yeah...

22:30.326 --> 22:31.886
April!

22:31.911 --> 22:33.812
Surprise.

22:33.837 --> 22:35.616
You knew about this too?!

22:35.732 --> 22:38.367
Oh, you saw me almost have a
heart attack when I got that text.

22:38.401 --> 22:40.369
I know. I wish I could have recorded that.

22:40.403 --> 22:41.403
You should have seen your face.

22:41.437 --> 22:43.572
You were so mad.

22:43.606 --> 22:45.240
Oh, great, so I missed the best part?

22:45.275 --> 22:46.441
Awesome. Sorry, April.

22:46.476 --> 22:48.278
Uh, you can thank the
conductor of the green line,

22:48.303 --> 22:49.848
who decided to stop at Park Street

22:49.873 --> 22:52.474
for 20 minutes, even though
there was nobody at the station.

22:54.417 --> 22:56.418
And what are your feelings on kale?

22:56.452 --> 22:58.040
It's not a real vegetable.

22:58.406 --> 23:00.241
Wait, how do you know
that I don't like kale?

23:00.266 --> 23:01.383
Do you follow me on Twitter?

23:01.408 --> 23:03.379
- No?

23:03.404 --> 23:05.005
You should. I'm hilarious.

23:09.666 --> 23:13.235
Being in a hospital right now is not
exactly taking my mind off things.

23:13.269 --> 23:15.237
Oh, hang on. Hang on a second.

23:16.822 --> 23:18.249
_

23:18.274 --> 23:20.208
"Cancer caregivers mixer"?

23:20.243 --> 23:22.411
Yeah, that's for people who are
dealing with what you're dealing with.

23:22.445 --> 23:24.279
I don't know. George, this...

23:24.314 --> 23:27.449
Listen, it... It's worth a try, right?

23:27.483 --> 23:29.451
If you hate it, you can always leave.

23:38.461 --> 23:40.662
To the first of many bylines.

23:40.697 --> 23:42.186
Thank you.

23:42.211 --> 23:44.333
But wait, you asked me
out before I got my byline.

23:44.367 --> 23:45.467
What were you gonna do if I didn't get it?

23:45.501 --> 23:47.234
Massages and Chuck E. Cheese's.

23:47.259 --> 23:50.281
Ohh, well, now I almost
wish I didn't get it.

23:50.306 --> 23:51.540
You'll still get the massage.

23:57.714 --> 23:59.414
Uh, why is Leo here?

23:59.449 --> 24:01.416
Oh, I invited him. Found him on Facebook.

24:01.451 --> 24:04.353
Did you know his profile picture
is Susan Sarandon in "Stepmom"?

24:04.387 --> 24:06.219
Ha, of course it is.

24:06.244 --> 24:08.423
He's a cool guy. Letting
you break that story,

24:08.458 --> 24:10.425
and requesting you for that
interview the other day.

24:10.460 --> 24:11.560
Yeah.

24:11.594 --> 24:13.295
- Hey hey hey!
- Hey, Dom.

24:13.329 --> 24:14.629
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank for inviting me.

24:14.664 --> 24:17.328
- I'll put this out.
- Okeydoke.

24:17.500 --> 24:21.503
Congratulations, April!

24:21.537 --> 24:23.238
Oh, hey, why are you so clenched, huh?

24:23.272 --> 24:26.162
Um, you know, it's kind of
awkward having you two here

24:26.187 --> 24:28.443
together, you know, after...

24:29.280 --> 24:30.412
What?

24:30.446 --> 24:33.215
You trying to kiss me the other day.

24:33.895 --> 24:34.922
Oh, that.

24:34.947 --> 24:35.947
Whatever.

24:35.982 --> 24:37.949
I tried to kiss like 10 girls since then.

24:37.984 --> 24:41.520
Seriously, relax. I'm
not here to sabotage you

24:41.554 --> 24:43.855
or... or tell everyone
your big secret, okay?

24:43.890 --> 24:45.857
I'm just here to party.

25:00.137 --> 25:01.171
Hey, there.

25:01.674 --> 25:02.902
Hey.

25:03.449 --> 25:04.952
Where do you guys keep the ice?

25:05.309 --> 25:07.946
I don't know. I don't work here.

25:07.980 --> 25:09.581
Has anyone ever told you

25:09.615 --> 25:11.483
that you look like a '70s rock star?

25:11.517 --> 25:12.919
Um...

25:13.516 --> 25:15.183
Dude, get off her.

25:15.208 --> 25:16.508
She's 16.

25:16.763 --> 25:18.307
Oh.

25:18.332 --> 25:19.465
Uh... mm...

25:19.826 --> 25:21.163
That... I...

25:21.188 --> 25:23.189
What?! No. I didn't do anything.

25:23.214 --> 25:25.082
You didn't have to. Just
'cause you're wearing glasses

25:25.107 --> 25:26.341
doesn't mean I can't see your eyes.

25:26.394 --> 25:27.842
Well, just 'cause you have an accent

25:27.867 --> 25:30.569
doesn't mean you're more interesting.

25:33.973 --> 25:35.774
Yeah, I know it'd be great, but

25:35.808 --> 25:37.943
is it okay if I just take
a minute to think about it?

25:37.977 --> 25:40.242
Yeah, I mean, this all happened so fast.

25:40.663 --> 25:42.121
Okay, great.

25:42.437 --> 25:43.604
Okay, I'll talk to you soon.

25:43.779 --> 25:44.931
Okay, bye.

25:46.495 --> 25:48.629
Can't tell if that was
good news or bad news.

25:48.921 --> 25:50.789
Not that I was eavesdropping.

25:51.056 --> 25:52.382
Okay, I can't lie to that face.

25:52.407 --> 25:53.558
I kinda was.

25:53.593 --> 25:56.728
It's a job offer to go on tour with a band.

25:56.763 --> 25:57.763
For four months.

25:58.965 --> 26:00.893
I have to decide if I'm even taking it.

26:01.207 --> 26:02.636
Why wouldn't you?

26:03.348 --> 26:05.382
Because of April?

26:05.605 --> 26:07.354
Yeah, I gotta figure it out.

26:07.379 --> 26:09.313
Just do me a favor and
don't mention it to her.

26:09.338 --> 26:10.661
I don't want her worrying about anything.

26:10.686 --> 26:11.729
It's her night.

26:18.508 --> 26:20.012
Do you, um...

26:20.037 --> 26:21.629
Ah, do you want some white wine?

26:21.921 --> 26:23.722
- Yeah, thanks.
- Okay.

26:29.610 --> 26:31.344
Hi, I'm Sara Carver.

26:31.597 --> 26:34.463
My daughter was just diagnosed with A.M.L.

26:34.867 --> 26:36.601
She's only 24 years old.

26:38.004 --> 26:40.672
It's just so hard trying to
figure out how to take care of her

26:40.706 --> 26:42.774
while I'm dealing with
my own grief, you know?

26:44.183 --> 26:46.037
Have you had anything
like that happen to you?

26:46.992 --> 26:48.091
Yeah.

26:58.925 --> 27:00.625
Okay, never have I ever been arrested.

27:00.660 --> 27:01.760
Hmm.

27:01.794 --> 27:03.461
Mm.

27:03.496 --> 27:04.896
Story.

27:04.931 --> 27:07.699
Caught with pot going
through airport security.

27:07.733 --> 27:09.601
Caught having sex at a carnival.

27:09.635 --> 27:10.869
Oh-ho-ho!

27:10.903 --> 27:11.903
Tell me he was wearing a clown suit.

27:13.024 --> 27:16.784
Okay, never have I ever...

27:17.233 --> 27:18.367
Hmm.

27:18.627 --> 27:20.561
Oh! Faked an orgasm.

27:20.847 --> 27:21.873
Never.

27:22.979 --> 27:24.749
Uh, how do you even do that?

27:24.784 --> 27:26.751
Uh, well, if the lights are out

27:26.786 --> 27:27.819
and the girl never sees...

27:27.854 --> 27:29.821
Stop! Just stop.

27:29.856 --> 27:32.616
We have a minor here, as you know.

27:32.641 --> 27:34.375
Okay okay, my turn.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.534
Never have I ever...

27:36.691 --> 27:38.758
Been attracted to someone of the same sex.

27:41.801 --> 27:42.934
Whoa, Brenna.

27:42.969 --> 27:44.253
I knew it!

27:44.278 --> 27:45.674
What do you mean you knew it?

27:45.699 --> 27:46.799
Do you wanna tell her or should I?

27:46.973 --> 27:48.484
Guys, shut up.

27:48.509 --> 27:50.744
This girl from her school.
I met her, she's adorable.

27:51.010 --> 27:52.611
What about Kieran?

27:52.645 --> 27:55.714
It's possible to like two
people at the same time.

27:55.748 --> 27:56.915
What's the big deal?

27:56.949 --> 27:58.817
Okay, now it's my turn.

27:58.851 --> 28:00.596
Never have I ever...

28:00.621 --> 28:02.998
Been attracted to anyone in this room.

28:17.462 --> 28:19.396
Hey, I'm taking off.

28:19.578 --> 28:20.645
Really?

28:20.671 --> 28:22.371
Yeah, you know, I just wanted to come by

28:22.405 --> 28:24.439
and pay my respects to
the guest of honor...

28:24.464 --> 28:27.266
So, you know, consider yourself respected.

28:27.291 --> 28:28.291
Thanks.

28:31.479 --> 28:32.579
Are you okay?

28:32.604 --> 28:34.217
Yeah, I'm having a...

28:34.529 --> 28:35.930
Little moral dilemma.

28:36.694 --> 28:38.657
I'm sorry, did you just
use the word "moral"

28:38.691 --> 28:39.791
in reference to yourself?

28:39.825 --> 28:41.693
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't tell you

28:41.727 --> 28:43.138
what I just found out about Dominic.

28:43.836 --> 28:44.836
What?

28:45.598 --> 28:47.761
He got that job.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.117
But he might not take it because of you.

28:52.563 --> 28:54.103
He told you that?

28:54.231 --> 28:58.598
Yeah, you can say we're having
kind of a bromance these days.

28:58.938 --> 29:00.655
He did ask me not to tell you,

29:00.919 --> 29:03.782
but you know my policy...
Freedom of information.

29:04.791 --> 29:06.948
I don't really believe in
hiding things from people.

29:08.075 --> 29:09.375
Congrats again.

29:17.787 --> 29:20.922
Okay, never have I ever...

29:21.146 --> 29:23.314
Slept with my second cousin.

29:23.339 --> 29:24.973
Oopsie Daisy.

29:24.998 --> 29:26.365
Boom! Yeah!

29:26.390 --> 29:28.391
Okay, Graham. No, we have
to stop doing this to her.

29:28.416 --> 29:30.501
Oh, no, but she's the MVP of this game.

29:30.526 --> 29:32.760
I mean, who am I kidding?

29:32.785 --> 29:36.587
This is why I never play "I never."

29:36.885 --> 29:38.404
Did that make sense?

29:38.429 --> 29:39.853
I'm...

29:39.878 --> 29:42.680
I'm gonna go get paper towels.

29:42.728 --> 29:44.028
This... this way.

29:44.053 --> 29:45.787
Yeah, okay...

29:45.812 --> 29:47.506
Never have I ever...

29:47.595 --> 29:49.704
Got into every college I applied to.

29:49.729 --> 29:50.795
Oh.

29:52.581 --> 29:54.220
Hey-oh!

29:55.525 --> 29:56.692
Hey.

29:56.945 --> 29:58.779
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.

29:58.804 --> 30:01.092
You guys! Lawrence is here.

30:01.117 --> 30:02.136
He's here.

30:09.387 --> 30:10.521
Uh!

30:16.364 --> 30:18.499
You're all fired.

30:18.901 --> 30:20.869
Effective immediately.

30:22.584 --> 30:24.116
So...

30:27.886 --> 30:29.590
You may as well come out.

30:30.497 --> 30:31.664
Lawrence.

30:34.993 --> 30:38.028
I was not here for this party.

30:38.357 --> 30:41.871
Um, I actually was here working
late anyways doing research.

30:41.896 --> 30:43.864
- No, you weren't.
- Lawrence, we're sorry.

30:44.010 --> 30:47.113
This was, um, a party for my byline.

30:47.138 --> 30:48.575
Aw, come on.

30:51.095 --> 30:52.963
I'm not a complete tyrant.

30:54.950 --> 30:56.718
As long as everything is
out of here by the time

30:56.743 --> 30:59.637
- I walk in at 6:00 A.M. tomorrow morning.
- It will be.

30:59.662 --> 31:02.631
And if I find out anyone
so much has touched my desk,

31:02.812 --> 31:04.158
remember...

31:04.653 --> 31:07.422
Y'all had to get fingerprinted
when you started working here.

31:07.447 --> 31:08.447
April.

31:08.472 --> 31:10.440
Can I talk to you a sec?

31:15.431 --> 31:17.391
Now that I know you can deliver,

31:17.416 --> 31:19.521
I'm gonna be leaning on you a bit more.

31:20.028 --> 31:22.052
I'm thinking we can go ahead and...

31:22.200 --> 31:24.234
eliminate Raquel as the middle man.

31:24.323 --> 31:26.171
You don't need a babysitter anymore.

31:28.888 --> 31:31.341
I'm so glad you trust me that much.

31:31.366 --> 31:34.134
But there's just one thing I
need to give you a heads-up about.

31:36.551 --> 31:38.985
I'm gonna need to take some time off soon.

31:40.698 --> 31:42.915
It's one byline, April.

31:43.113 --> 31:46.849
Is this what they mean when they say
the millennial generation is entitled?

31:46.874 --> 31:48.435
No, it's...

31:48.939 --> 31:50.581
A medical thing.

31:51.551 --> 31:52.941
Oh.

31:52.966 --> 31:55.902
Okay, just let me know
how much time you need.

31:57.094 --> 31:58.482
I will.

31:58.996 --> 32:00.630
Have a nice night.

32:07.036 --> 32:08.102
I have to admit, I'm surprised.

32:08.127 --> 32:11.095
These caregivers don't seem very caring.

32:11.120 --> 32:14.022
Oh, you know what? There's Brian Connors.

32:14.047 --> 32:16.115
Yeah, he's a nice guy. Let
me introduce you to him.

32:19.349 --> 32:21.517
Dr. Carver, what are you doing here?

32:21.779 --> 32:24.329
- This is my sister-in-law Sara.
- Hi.

32:24.354 --> 32:26.674
We just found out that
her daughter has leukemia.

32:26.919 --> 32:27.919
I'm sorry.

32:28.410 --> 32:31.212
Thank you. Yeah. It's been really hard.

32:31.237 --> 32:34.106
Like right now, she and I
are in this power struggle

32:34.131 --> 32:35.932
over when she's gonna
start her chemo and...

32:35.957 --> 32:37.569
Yeah, that sounds hard.

32:37.594 --> 32:39.639
Maybe you should talk
to a therapist about it.

32:40.820 --> 32:42.854
Well, I... I am a therapist.

32:43.222 --> 32:45.023
Well, there you go.

32:45.048 --> 32:48.741
I'm sorry. Brian, I'm confused.

32:48.766 --> 32:50.612
I thought the point of this event was that

32:50.637 --> 32:53.739
caregivers could find
support from each other.

32:53.764 --> 32:56.533
Look, I've been dealing
with my son having cancer

32:56.558 --> 32:58.559
for almost 10 years now,

32:58.584 --> 33:00.619
and most of the people
that come here every week,

33:00.644 --> 33:01.818
it's because it's the one place

33:01.843 --> 33:04.398
we can chat, get a little Pinot buzz

33:04.423 --> 33:06.944
and not talk about cancer.

33:08.505 --> 33:09.739
Okay.

33:09.773 --> 33:10.740
So.

33:10.774 --> 33:12.408
It's all right.

33:13.083 --> 33:15.652
Sara, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

33:15.677 --> 33:17.364
It's fine. I appreciate the effort, really.

33:17.389 --> 33:18.946
Well, I just wanted to help.

33:19.100 --> 33:21.135
But can you cure cancer?!

33:22.419 --> 33:24.146
Seriously, can you go back in time

33:24.171 --> 33:25.398
and change major life events?

33:25.423 --> 33:27.858
Can you explain to me why April?!

33:28.059 --> 33:31.060
Is it something I did or
something I could have,

33:31.085 --> 33:33.059
I don't know, prevented in some way?

33:33.084 --> 33:34.453
Can you... can you...

33:34.478 --> 33:36.445
Put some of the blame on me?

33:36.470 --> 33:39.605
So I can make some damn
sense out of all this?!

33:39.630 --> 33:43.089
I sit all day long, and
I... I listen to people

33:43.114 --> 33:45.115
talk about the worst parts of their lives.

33:45.140 --> 33:47.041
And I help them make sense out of it all.

33:47.066 --> 33:49.835
But I cannot seem to do that for myself.

33:49.860 --> 33:51.562
And I'm mad. I'm... I'm...

33:51.587 --> 33:53.907
I'm mad at the world.

33:53.932 --> 33:56.464
I'm mad at April. I'm mad at you!

33:56.642 --> 33:58.543
I'm... I'm just...

33:58.568 --> 34:00.468
I'm mad!

34:03.548 --> 34:05.176
So how'd that feel?

34:05.726 --> 34:08.565
It felt great!

34:08.590 --> 34:11.096
It felt really...

34:12.667 --> 34:14.802
Great, yes.

34:18.942 --> 34:20.643
Let's go.

34:54.774 --> 34:56.608
- There you are.
- Hey.

34:56.632 --> 34:58.668
Sorry, I was just taking a
little break from the game.

34:58.693 --> 35:01.662
Yeah, it started to
make me feel pretty lame.

35:01.687 --> 35:04.789
I realized how much I
hadn't done until tonight.

35:07.038 --> 35:08.705
So I've been thinking about that job.

35:08.730 --> 35:09.930
Yeah, me too.

35:09.955 --> 35:10.989
I just wanted to ask you...

35:11.014 --> 35:12.748
I think you should take it.

35:14.193 --> 35:15.927
I mean, if you get it.

35:17.869 --> 35:20.037
You'd really be cool with
me leaving for that long?

35:21.252 --> 35:23.307
It's a great opportunity, Dominic.

35:23.332 --> 35:25.233
And I know how much you want it.

35:25.676 --> 35:27.366
Yeah, but, you know...

35:27.391 --> 35:29.692
There's other things that I want here.

35:29.717 --> 35:31.518
In Boston.

35:32.506 --> 35:36.619
I know, but that's a lot of
pressure to put on our relationship.

35:36.644 --> 35:38.645
I mean, if anything ever
went wrong, we would just...

35:38.670 --> 35:40.039
You think that might happen?

35:40.242 --> 35:42.210
I don't know, I'm just
trying to be realistic.

35:44.856 --> 35:46.223
Hey, can I talk to you?

35:46.248 --> 35:47.454
What's wrong?

35:47.641 --> 35:49.084
Is Graham still hitting on you?

35:49.109 --> 35:50.743
Just tell him you eat red meat

35:50.768 --> 35:52.870
- and he'll leave you alone.
- Come here.

35:58.025 --> 35:59.107
Who is this?

36:10.296 --> 36:12.197
Just tell me. Who is she?

36:12.232 --> 36:15.283
I didn't wanna tell you like this, but...

36:15.902 --> 36:18.237
That girl is our half-sister.

36:18.271 --> 36:20.205
Her name is Natalie Ortiz.

36:20.607 --> 36:21.929
What?

36:25.078 --> 36:26.912
Does this mean that dad...

36:26.946 --> 36:30.149
Yeah, I guess he had an
affair a long time ago.

36:31.062 --> 36:34.052
So, was his whole marriage to mom a lie?

36:34.805 --> 36:36.749
I don't think so. I don't know.

36:36.774 --> 36:39.901
I... I'm... I'm so sorry
you found out like this.

36:39.926 --> 36:41.894
I was gonna tell you, but with everything

36:41.928 --> 36:44.534
that's been happening, it
was just never the right time.

36:46.281 --> 36:47.640
Oh, my God. Dad.

36:47.665 --> 36:49.632
I don't want this to make you hate him.

36:49.657 --> 36:51.904
That was my first reaction too.

36:51.938 --> 36:56.183
But we have no idea how he
felt about that woman or mom.

36:56.246 --> 36:59.054
And you said it yourself, maybe
it's possible to like 2 people.

36:59.079 --> 37:01.941
and who knows, maybe he was
planning on telling us the truth

37:01.966 --> 37:03.933
at some point, and then he...

37:03.968 --> 37:05.902
You know, was gone
before he got the chance.

37:07.137 --> 37:10.136
If there's one thing I've
learned since getting sick,

37:10.161 --> 37:15.211
it's that being honest is
much harder than it seems.

37:15.245 --> 37:19.115
Especially if you're afraid you'll
hurt someone you really care about.

37:24.288 --> 37:25.652
Let me help.

37:31.929 --> 37:33.896
I took the job.

37:38.168 --> 37:39.969
Congratulations.

37:40.004 --> 37:42.721
It's huge. Are you excited?

37:42.746 --> 37:44.641
Yeah, yeah.

37:44.877 --> 37:46.787
But it's not like
getting your first byline.

37:47.147 --> 37:49.379
Are you excited?

37:49.413 --> 37:51.047
Totally.

37:56.140 --> 37:58.578
Ahem. Hey, I have one
more "I never" for you.

37:58.723 --> 38:01.632
Oh, yeah? Let's hear it.

38:07.358 --> 38:09.393
What are you doing here?

38:09.427 --> 38:11.361
You haven't been answering my texts,

38:11.396 --> 38:14.298
and I wanted to talk about what happened.

38:14.332 --> 38:16.300
We did. You apologized.

38:16.334 --> 38:17.468
It's fine.

38:18.209 --> 38:19.977
I know, but I...

38:20.438 --> 38:23.340
Didn't say everything that I wanted to say.

38:24.935 --> 38:27.677
When you caught me with
Kieran in your room,

38:27.702 --> 38:29.669
I felt really bad.

38:30.515 --> 38:34.002
Like worse than I've ever felt about a guy.

38:35.058 --> 38:36.533
I don't know what that means.

38:36.558 --> 38:39.870
All I know is I can't
deal with you hating me.

38:40.191 --> 38:42.522
Brenna.

38:43.127 --> 38:44.394
I don't hate you.

38:45.247 --> 38:46.296
Look.

38:46.331 --> 38:49.066
It's just hard when you're into girls

38:49.100 --> 38:52.302
and you have no idea if they're into girls.

38:52.790 --> 38:55.625
But you hurt my feelings because...

38:56.374 --> 38:57.946
I don't know.

38:59.785 --> 39:01.607
I felt like we had a thing.

39:03.249 --> 39:04.503
I did too.

39:05.893 --> 39:07.336
"Did."

39:08.258 --> 39:10.120
Past tense.

39:10.716 --> 39:12.122
No.

39:14.092 --> 39:15.459
Present tense.

39:36.774 --> 39:38.491
When you told me you had one last "I never"

39:38.516 --> 39:40.350
that you wanted to try with me,

39:40.385 --> 39:43.287
this isn't exactly what
I thought you had in mind.

39:43.321 --> 39:45.355
I had some other ideas.

39:45.694 --> 39:48.258
I just wanted to make sure you
remembered me with some respect.

39:52.287 --> 39:57.095
So, what's the plan for us while I'm gone?

39:58.469 --> 40:00.369
It's four months.

40:01.139 --> 40:02.406
You're gonna be all over the place,

40:02.440 --> 40:05.509
different time zones, meeting people.

40:05.543 --> 40:07.210
I want you to just enjoy that.

40:07.911 --> 40:09.546
And not have to worry about me.

40:09.581 --> 40:11.348
Or anything.

40:11.728 --> 40:13.399
You deserve it.

40:14.178 --> 40:15.978
But what do you want?

40:16.154 --> 40:18.268
I don't know.

40:18.623 --> 40:20.490
I have a lot of stuff
to figure out right now,

40:20.525 --> 40:24.394
and I think it's probably
better that I do that on my own.

40:28.166 --> 40:29.499
So you wanna take a break?

40:29.534 --> 40:33.303
I just don't want us to start
resenting each other, you know?

40:40.144 --> 40:42.112
Can we wait another
hour to start the break?

40:43.448 --> 40:45.382
Yeah.

40:45.416 --> 40:47.284
One more hour.

41:13.730 --> 41:15.598
Beth, I can see you.

41:21.519 --> 41:24.325
Okay, so, uh, the thing is...

41:25.189 --> 41:27.424
We kept playing the drinking
game after you guys left...

41:27.458 --> 41:29.426
Who wants pancakes, huh?

41:32.196 --> 41:33.622
Oh.

41:34.239 --> 41:35.432
It's all happening.

41:39.537 --> 41:41.138
Hi, this is April.

41:41.172 --> 41:42.272
This is Dr. Kang's office

41:42.306 --> 41:43.407
calling to schedule your next appointment.

41:43.441 --> 41:45.208
Yes. Thank you.

41:45.243 --> 41:46.443
And while I have you, I was wondering if

41:46.477 --> 41:48.345
- I could arrange a payment plan.
- Okay.

41:48.379 --> 41:49.513
Let me see.

41:49.547 --> 41:51.548
Oh, looks like you're all set.

41:51.582 --> 41:52.733
I'm sorry?

41:52.758 --> 41:54.279
Your payment was already processed.

41:54.304 --> 41:56.205
But I haven't paid yet.

41:56.230 --> 41:58.264
Well, someone else did.

41:58.322 --> 42:00.123
They asked to remain anonymous.

42:00.158 --> 42:02.192
I guess it's your lucky day.
