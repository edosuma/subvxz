00:51.943 --> 00:52.976
- Yeah.

01:01.111 --> 01:03.344
- Alright, ladies, let's
move to the sanctuary.

01:03.345 --> 01:05.810
- I just, give me one second.

01:44.884 --> 01:45.918
- Ready?

01:49.952 --> 01:52.053
- Lord, give him strength.

02:15.623 --> 02:19.889
- One, two, three,

02:19.890 --> 02:23.757
four, five, six,

02:23.758 --> 02:28.091
seven, eight, nine.

02:37.960 --> 02:39.660
10.

02:45.095 --> 02:47.395
- 11.
- 11.

02:47.396 --> 02:49.727
- 12.
- 12.

02:49.728 --> 02:53.596
13, 14,

02:56.363 --> 02:59.463
15, that's the number after 14, 16.

02:59.464 --> 03:00.464
Alright, guys, you did good.

03:00.465 --> 03:02.398
I'll see you next week, okay?

03:03.232 --> 03:05.432
Good, get outta here.

03:06.499 --> 03:07.630
Ben
- Boom.

03:07.631 --> 03:08.631
- Boom, baby.

03:08.632 --> 03:10.165
- Yeah.
- You gonna help

03:10.166 --> 03:11.332
me out next week?
- Of course.

03:11.333 --> 03:12.965
- Alright.

03:12.966 --> 03:14.332
See you later.

03:14.333 --> 03:16.433
- Good job, man, see you Monday.

03:16.434 --> 03:17.899
- Have a good week.
- You, too.

03:17.900 --> 03:19.433
- I'm not
exactly sure when it was

03:19.434 --> 03:22.134
that I fell in love with Michael Boyum.

03:22.135 --> 03:26.034
- Hi, Michael?

03:26.035 --> 03:28.801
- Yeah, you're Michelle,
uh, Danny's sister.

03:28.802 --> 03:30.634
- When we met,
I don't think either of us

03:30.635 --> 03:33.136
really knew what real love even was.

03:33.137 --> 03:35.136
I did know he was cute.

03:35.137 --> 03:37.535
Not quite as cute as he thought he was.

03:37.536 --> 03:39.303
With those stunning blue eyes like

03:39.304 --> 03:41.603
Leonardo DiCaprio from Titanic

03:41.604 --> 03:43.703
and there was just something about him

03:43.704 --> 03:45.771
that connected with me.

03:45.772 --> 03:48.371
- It looked fun.

03:48.372 --> 03:50.371
- Anyone can join if you're interested.

03:50.372 --> 03:52.339
- Oh, that's, that's cool.

03:52.340 --> 03:53.638
Um, yeah, I'll think about it.

03:53.639 --> 03:54.938
- You're really gonna think about it?

03:54.939 --> 03:56.205
- I promise.
- 'Cause those

03:56.206 --> 03:57.606
flyers are expensive.
- Oh.

03:57.607 --> 03:59.273
- You'd be awesome at it.

03:59.274 --> 04:01.106
We'll get you a GI and
teach you some moves,

04:01.107 --> 04:03.241
you're gonna be a ninja
in, like, two weeks.

04:03.242 --> 04:04.707
- My guns are huge.

04:04.708 --> 04:06.007
I'm just kidding.

04:06.008 --> 04:08.441
Okay, I'll see you, see you at school.

04:08.442 --> 04:10.143
- Okay.

04:11.909 --> 04:13.442
Hey, Michelle?

04:13.443 --> 04:14.641
- Yeah?

04:14.642 --> 04:18.476
- Uh, do you want to

04:18.476 --> 04:23.377
uh, do you want to go
get a milkshake with me?

04:23.378 --> 04:25.044
- Yeah.
- Really?

04:25.045 --> 04:26.244
- Yeah, sure.
- Let's go

04:26.245 --> 04:27.445
right now.
- Okay.

04:27.446 --> 04:28.778
- Come on.
- It's a good thing

04:28.779 --> 04:29.844
I'm not busy.
- I know,

04:29.845 --> 04:31.088
that would have been really awkward...

04:31.112 --> 04:32.378
- You know what would have been weird?

04:32.379 --> 04:34.379
If I'm like, oh, I've
actually got math homework.

04:34.380 --> 04:35.845
- You do?
- No.

04:35.846 --> 04:36.912
- Okay, good.

04:36.913 --> 04:38.645
- Sure, it was just puppy love,

04:38.646 --> 04:41.013
but we thought it was more.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.048
We both got grief for it.

04:44.714 --> 04:46.081
Don't you need your shoes?

04:46.082 --> 04:47.847
- I'm a ninja,
what do I need shoes for?

04:48.882 --> 04:51.049
♫ I love to see you smiling,

04:51.050 --> 04:53.982
♫ in the morning sun

04:53.983 --> 04:56.449
♫ It makes me realize

04:56.450 --> 04:59.250
♫ that you are the one

04:59.251 --> 05:00.949
- We're gonna find it.
- No, we're not.

05:00.950 --> 05:02.383
The internet says it's here.

05:02.384 --> 05:04.184
Hey, buddy, give me one more second.

05:04.185 --> 05:06.284
- Hey, guys, did you find
that geometry thing yet?

05:06.285 --> 05:08.251
- It's a geocache, it's
treasure that people

05:08.252 --> 05:09.684
put in a box from all over the world.

05:09.685 --> 05:11.818
- Yeah, that's great, keep
going, keep going, farther.

05:11.819 --> 05:13.385
- Here?

05:13.386 --> 05:14.818
- 10 bucks says he drops it.

05:14.819 --> 05:16.819
- 10 bucks says you
throw it off the bridge.

05:16.820 --> 05:18.154
- Alright.

05:21.921 --> 05:23.421
- Ow!

05:23.422 --> 05:24.822
- Can't catch! Perfect toss!

05:29.655 --> 05:31.822
- Hey, uh, bro,

05:31.855 --> 05:33.823
I think I found your treasure right here.

05:38.490 --> 05:40.589
- Michelle, find the geocache.

05:42.024 --> 05:44.790
- So, you two are officially going out?

05:44.791 --> 05:45.792
- Yes.

05:45.793 --> 05:47.091
Cradle robber.

05:47.092 --> 05:49.224
- Two years, jerk, two years.

05:49.225 --> 05:51.758
- A lot of girls date older boys.

05:51.759 --> 05:54.558
- I don't know, somethin'
about him, he's too nice.

05:54.559 --> 05:56.459
- Too nice?
- Yeah.

05:56.460 --> 05:58.993
Boys his age have a one-track mind.

05:58.994 --> 06:00.692
This nice-guy thing is just an act.

06:00.693 --> 06:03.194
- Would you just let
the girl eat in peace?

06:03.195 --> 06:04.795
- I have spoken.

06:06.395 --> 06:09.694
- Ooh, a senior,

06:09.695 --> 06:12.262
I'm just an itty-bitty sophomore,

06:12.263 --> 06:16.464
helpless to your upper-classman charm.

06:17.663 --> 06:21.330
- I really like her, she's a sweet girl.

06:21.331 --> 06:23.830
And men should really date
women younger than them.

06:23.831 --> 06:25.264
- Why's that?

06:25.265 --> 06:27.132
- 'Cause women mature quicker than men.

06:27.166 --> 06:29.265
The age difference balances it out.

06:29.266 --> 06:31.231
- You know, you're
outnumbered, you're 4-to-1.

06:31.232 --> 06:34.733
- Mmm, does James count?

06:35.833 --> 06:37.133
- Aww.

06:37.566 --> 06:40.167
♫ La La La La La La

06:40.168 --> 06:42.534
♫ Oh

06:42.535 --> 06:45.134
♫ La La La La La La

06:45.135 --> 06:47.369
♫ Oh.

06:48.102 --> 06:52.036
♫ I love to run my hand across your hand

06:53.203 --> 06:55.335
♫ There's nothing I could do

06:55.336 --> 06:58.136
♫ and there's nothing I can't

06:58.137 --> 07:00.602
♫ I love to love you so

07:00.603 --> 07:03.071
♫ Let all my feelings go

07:03.072 --> 07:07.638
♫ I love to run my hand across your hand

07:13.273 --> 07:16.006
- Madame, tonight, I will be your waiter.

07:17.474 --> 07:21.442
May I offer you some of
our finest sparkling water.

07:22.341 --> 07:24.674
- You are so weird,

07:25.908 --> 07:27.208
but a good weird.

07:27.209 --> 07:28.209
- I know.

07:30.543 --> 07:32.141
- He worked
for a barbecue company

07:32.142 --> 07:34.142
and insisted on driving us everywhere

07:34.143 --> 07:36.009
in the pigmobile.

07:36.010 --> 07:38.509
I came to hate that thing.

07:38.510 --> 07:39.776
I could never explain to my friends

07:39.777 --> 07:42.077
why I always smelled like pork.

07:42.078 --> 07:46.844
- No, no, I am not going
to prom in the pigmobile.

07:46.845 --> 07:49.545
No, I'm not doing it.

07:49.546 --> 07:51.546
Stop looking at me like that.

07:51.547 --> 07:55.978
No, oh, Michael, you kill me.

07:57.081 --> 07:59.579
- I have Michelle Larson with me.

07:59.580 --> 08:04.214
I'm driving a pig to prom
with Michelle Larson.

08:04.215 --> 08:06.148
- Stop.

08:21.617 --> 08:25.084
- Michael was
an enthusiastic dancer.

08:25.085 --> 08:27.585
He did not care how he looked.

08:44.054 --> 08:46.155
- I love you.

08:47.222 --> 08:49.855
- You're not supposed to
say that unless you mean it.

08:53.923 --> 08:55.689
- I do mean it.

08:57.224 --> 08:58.990
- Why?

08:59.024 --> 09:01.790
- Why do I love you?
- Yeah.

09:01.824 --> 09:04.858
- Uh, 'cause you're pretty

09:04.891 --> 09:08.624
and you're silly, and awesome

09:08.659 --> 09:10.625
and because you're my soul mate.

09:16.060 --> 09:20.427
- Well, someday I'll
be old and wrinkly

09:20.593 --> 09:21.828
I might smell

09:21.861 --> 09:23.094
- Gross.

09:23.095 --> 09:25.027
- Don't say that.

09:25.028 --> 09:26.894
- I'll always love you.

09:26.895 --> 09:28.862
Always.

09:32.496 --> 09:34.263
- I think you're my soul mate too.

10:17.870 --> 10:19.036
- Hey, guys.

10:19.037 --> 10:20.503
- Hi
- Hey.

10:20.504 --> 10:22.037
- Want some?

10:22.038 --> 10:23.637
- It's good.
- Come on.

10:24.371 --> 10:27.438
There's only one ninja in this family.

10:27.439 --> 10:29.671
Take it off, take it
off, shut this door, man.

10:29.672 --> 10:30.672
Grab a sandwich.

10:30.673 --> 10:32.538
- They're really
good, they are really good.

10:32.539 --> 10:35.638
I was his Rose and he was my Jack.

10:35.639 --> 10:38.474
Neither one of us saw what
was waiting in the darkness.

10:39.475 --> 10:41.606
- Ichi.

10:41.607 --> 10:43.107
Ni.

10:43.108 --> 10:44.140
- Good kick, buddy.

10:44.141 --> 10:46.974
- Same stance, do another
punch with the back hand.

10:46.975 --> 10:48.974
Ichi

10:48.975 --> 10:50.908
Ni

10:50.909 --> 10:52.608
San

10:52.609 --> 10:54.375
Shi

10:54.376 --> 10:56.175
Go

10:56.176 --> 10:57.742
Ichi

10:57.743 --> 10:59.742
Ni

10:59.743 --> 11:01.510
- I'm not feeling too good, okay?

11:01.511 --> 11:02.954
- Alright, why don't you
take off, get some rest.

11:02.978 --> 11:03.978
See you next time.

11:05.078 --> 11:06.810
- San

11:06.811 --> 11:08.411
Shi

11:29.316 --> 11:30.316
- Look, look, look,

11:30.317 --> 11:31.448
you tell me you can't see that?

11:31.449 --> 11:34.416
That is obviously a hunter with a bow

11:34.417 --> 11:36.882
shootin' his arrows at that octopus.

11:36.883 --> 11:39.916
Octopus right there.
- Oh, my, whatever.

11:39.917 --> 11:42.850
Whatever.
- That's what it is.

11:42.851 --> 11:44.317
It's a fact.

11:44.318 --> 11:46.151
- Oh, I just saw a shooting star.

11:46.152 --> 11:49.485
I saw it first, so I get to make the wish.

11:49.486 --> 11:50.785
- Go for it.

11:50.786 --> 11:52.486
You have to hurry, though,
because once it's gone,

11:52.487 --> 11:53.552
you can't make the wish anymore,

11:53.553 --> 11:55.085
and then, you won't
have a wish, so you got,

11:55.086 --> 11:57.453
did you make it, you got it?

11:57.454 --> 11:58.986
What'd you wish for?

11:58.987 --> 12:00.953
- I'm not gonna tell you.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.487
Sorry, I'm sorry.

12:02.488 --> 12:03.620
- Alright, tell you what,

12:03.621 --> 12:08.622
if you can't answer one
simple, little, tiny question,

12:08.822 --> 12:11.821
then you have to tell me
what you wished for, k?

12:11.822 --> 12:13.721
- What kind of question?

12:13.722 --> 12:18.389
- Trivia, about what's out there.

12:18.390 --> 12:20.923
- Go for it, space nerd.

12:20.924 --> 12:23.057
- Space nerd.

12:23.058 --> 12:26.657
How many planets are in our solar system?

12:26.658 --> 12:29.891
- Uh, well,

12:29.892 --> 12:34.859
Pluto is not a planet anymore, so, eight

12:34.860 --> 12:37.426
- Good, I thought I was gonna
stump you with that one.

12:37.427 --> 12:39.759
Double or nothing?

12:39.760 --> 12:42.127
- What you got?

12:42.128 --> 12:44.026
- Alright, Larson's gettin' cocky here.

12:44.027 --> 12:46.927
How many stars are in the galaxy?

12:46.928 --> 12:48.760
- Our galaxy?
- Yes, our galaxy,

12:48.761 --> 12:51.462
the Milky Way galaxy, how many stars?

12:51.463 --> 12:53.229
Go.

12:53.230 --> 12:55.728
- A lot, a lot.

12:55.729 --> 12:57.297
- Yeah.

12:58.264 --> 13:00.396
- A million?

13:00.397 --> 13:04.763
- Is that your final answer?

13:04.764 --> 13:06.864
- One hundred million?

13:06.865 --> 13:10.265
- One hundred to 400 billion.

13:10.266 --> 13:12.565
Boom.

13:12.566 --> 13:14.098
That's a lot of stars.

13:14.099 --> 13:16.233
And that's just our galaxy.

13:16.234 --> 13:18.833
You ever wonder what it all means?

13:22.535 --> 13:24.934
What's God up to?

13:28.969 --> 13:30.135
- You okay?

13:30.136 --> 13:31.435
- Yeah.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.536
- You've been touching your
neck a lot, I wondered.

13:33.537 --> 13:35.336
- Oh, I've had a sore throat

13:35.337 --> 13:37.702
and I went to the doctor a couple days ago

13:37.703 --> 13:39.303
and they took my blood

13:39.304 --> 13:41.137
and then they didn't like
how the blood looked,

13:41.138 --> 13:42.570
so they want to do more tests.

13:42.571 --> 13:44.871
- What does that, what didn't he like?

13:44.872 --> 13:46.371
What does that mean?

13:46.372 --> 13:47.904
- I don't know, I don't know,

13:47.905 --> 13:50.439
I think I'm fighting a virus or something.

13:50.440 --> 13:51.472
It's really nothing.

13:51.473 --> 13:53.272
- Well I wish you would have told me,

13:53.273 --> 13:56.607
'cause then I could have
wished for you to feel better.

13:56.608 --> 13:58.540
- Michelle, that is so sweet.

13:58.541 --> 14:01.006
You are the sweetest person I've ever met.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.441
Seriously, what was your wish?

14:02.442 --> 14:03.807
Please, tell me.

14:03.808 --> 14:08.610
- Okay, fine, I wished
that on our next date

14:10.543 --> 14:13.509
maybe we could have seafood?

14:13.510 --> 14:16.109
- Are you, really, that's what,

14:16.110 --> 14:18.476
you had a wish on a shooting star

14:18.477 --> 14:20.209
passing through our magical galaxy

14:20.210 --> 14:22.277
and you waste it on seafood?

14:22.278 --> 14:25.410
- Okay, I'm sorry, barbecue
gets a little bit old.

14:25.411 --> 14:26.978
- I hate seafood.

14:26.979 --> 14:28.812
- I love it.

14:30.479 --> 14:32.112
- Fine.

14:33.380 --> 14:35.179
Ms. Larson, on our next date,

14:35.180 --> 14:38.280
I will take you to get seafood.

14:39.714 --> 14:41.779
- Thank you.

14:41.780 --> 14:46.747
Ah, no, I don't want to
get your germs, Mr. Germy.

14:46.748 --> 14:49.047
- Mr. Germy?

14:49.048 --> 14:50.915
- Well, you're gonna have to catch me.

14:50.916 --> 14:52.915
- Hey, you're leavin' the sandwiches.

14:52.916 --> 14:53.948
- I'm sorry.

14:53.949 --> 14:55.015
- Hey, stop.
- I don't

14:55.016 --> 14:56.649
like barbecue.
- Michelle!

14:56.650 --> 14:59.383
- Acute Myelogenous Leukemia,

14:59.384 --> 15:02.183
it's a cancer of the
blood and bone marrow.

15:02.184 --> 15:05.184
Normally, we see this in older patients,

15:05.185 --> 15:06.783
usually around 60 or so,

15:06.784 --> 15:10.552
but sometimes in people
your age, and even younger.

15:10.553 --> 15:13.651
In AML, the bone marrow
makes abnormal blood cells

15:13.652 --> 15:17.286
that don't form properly
and can't fight infection.

15:17.287 --> 15:20.621
These leukemia cells then crowd
out the normal blood cells

15:20.622 --> 15:22.721
that your body needs.

15:23.888 --> 15:26.320
AML can be very aggressive, so we need to

15:26.321 --> 15:30.088
get chemotherapy treatment
started as soon as possible.

15:30.089 --> 15:31.722
That okay?

15:35.956 --> 15:37.624
- Yeah.

15:38.891 --> 15:40.789
- I promise you we will get

15:40.790 --> 15:44.223
the best treatment plan
possible for Michael.

15:44.224 --> 15:47.225
He's young, he can fight this.

15:49.459 --> 15:51.992
- You okay?

15:51.993 --> 15:54.692
- Uh, yeah, dude, I need to, um,

15:55.993 --> 15:58.561
I need to take my pills.

16:03.195 --> 16:06.793
- So, uh, what's our next step, then?

16:06.794 --> 16:09.462
- Go home, pack your bags.

16:09.463 --> 16:11.895
You'll be staying here for
the duration of the treatment.

16:11.896 --> 16:13.861
- He has to stay here the entire time?

16:13.862 --> 16:15.630
- The chemotherapy treatment will make

16:15.631 --> 16:18.762
his immune system virtually non-existent.

16:18.763 --> 16:21.632
He'll be really vulnerable to infection.

16:24.565 --> 16:29.366
- Well, I have been wanting my own place.

16:51.503 --> 16:55.302
- Hello, I'm nurse Katie,
nice to meet you,

16:55.303 --> 16:56.570
just follow me to your room.

17:54.346 --> 17:55.978
- I'd like us all to take a moment

17:55.979 --> 17:59.480
to say a prayer for a young
man in our congregation

17:59.481 --> 18:01.213
going through a very challenging

18:01.214 --> 18:03.780
and difficult time in his life.

18:03.781 --> 18:05.914
Michael Boyum was recently diagnosed

18:05.915 --> 18:08.915
with a very aggressive form of leukemia.

18:08.916 --> 18:12.915
I was reminded of a verse
in Psalms, which reads,

18:12.916 --> 18:15.916
"Many are the afflictions
of the righteous,

18:15.917 --> 18:19.815
"but the Lord delivers
them out of them all."

18:19.816 --> 18:23.217
And I was immediately struck
by the verse that followed,

18:23.218 --> 18:27.285
which says, "He keeps all his bones,

18:27.286 --> 18:31.051
"not one of them is broken."

18:31.052 --> 18:33.386
This really struck a chord with me

18:33.387 --> 18:35.486
and I shared it with Michael's family,

18:35.487 --> 18:38.320
because it is in one's bones

18:38.321 --> 18:43.220
where things go wrong when
a person has leukemia.

18:43.221 --> 18:45.921
- You'll feel some pressure,

18:45.922 --> 18:48.955
pressure, pressure, pressure.

18:53.923 --> 18:55.989
- Thank you.

18:56.591 --> 18:59.223
- They just stuck you with a big needle.

18:59.224 --> 19:01.624
You don't need to say thank you.

19:02.625 --> 19:04.224
- We're gonna dedicate tonight's game

19:04.225 --> 19:06.890
to Matt's brother, Michael,
who's bravely battling cancer.

19:06.891 --> 19:08.225
I want to see that same fighting energy

19:08.226 --> 19:09.292
in every single one of you guys

19:09.293 --> 19:10.925
on the field tonight, alright?

19:10.926 --> 19:12.824
Let's go out there and win
this one for Michael Boyum.

19:12.825 --> 19:14.661
Bring it in!

19:15.993 --> 19:18.426
Give me a Spartans on
three, one, two, three.

19:18.427 --> 19:19.459
- Spartans!

19:34.130 --> 19:36.629
- Alright, I'm gonna
change out your tubing

19:36.630 --> 19:39.064
and you're free for 20 minutes.
Have fun.

19:41.897 --> 19:44.198
- I feel the wind through my bald head.

19:44.199 --> 19:47.265
Yeah!

19:48.032 --> 19:52.499
- Bonjour, the finest dinner for you,

19:52.500 --> 19:54.632
and, of course, souffle.

19:58.267 --> 19:59.667
- Hit me.

19:59.668 --> 20:01.767
Ahh.

20:07.834 --> 20:09.335
- Hey.
- Hi.

20:09.336 --> 20:11.168
- Hey.
- Michael.

20:11.169 --> 20:13.101
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

20:13.102 --> 20:15.036
I got this for you.

20:15.037 --> 20:18.102
- My goodness,
look at that, it's our class.

20:18.103 --> 20:19.403
- Yes, it is.

20:19.404 --> 20:21.337
- And there we are.
- Yeah.

20:21.338 --> 20:23.803
- Couple of ninjas.
- Yeah.

20:23.804 --> 20:25.437
- Everybody sign this?

20:25.438 --> 20:27.904
- Yep, on it, everybody did.

20:27.905 --> 20:29.705
- Really cool, thank you.

20:32.106 --> 20:34.273
- Are you scared?

20:38.374 --> 20:39.473
- Do you remember when you were

20:39.474 --> 20:40.974
gonna test for your blue belt?

20:41.007 --> 20:42.640
- Yeah.
- And we were about

20:42.641 --> 20:45.541
to get started, and then
you felt really scared

20:45.542 --> 20:47.308
and you ran off and I was like,

20:47.309 --> 20:49.641
"Ben, no.

20:49.642 --> 20:51.475
"Where are you going?"

20:53.510 --> 20:55.775
And then I had to come get you.

20:55.776 --> 20:57.310
And then I told you that I'd seen you

20:57.311 --> 20:59.511
do those katas over 100 times

20:59.544 --> 21:01.577
and that you could do it!

21:01.578 --> 21:04.010
So we went back in, we started the test,

21:04.011 --> 21:05.211
and then what happened?

21:05.212 --> 21:07.611
- And now I'm a blue belt.

21:07.612 --> 21:09.778
- Exactly.

21:09.779 --> 21:11.812
You still scared?

21:12.979 --> 21:15.513
- Well, sometimes.

21:15.514 --> 21:18.246
- Sometimes.

21:18.247 --> 21:20.247
That's how I feel.

21:20.248 --> 21:23.347
But I know that I have somebody with me

21:23.348 --> 21:27.181
same way that I was with you.

21:27.182 --> 21:30.081
And then I'm not scared anymore.

21:30.082 --> 21:33.282
And everything's gonna be okay.

21:33.283 --> 21:35.216
Right?
- Right.

21:35.217 --> 21:37.050
- Come here.

21:38.051 --> 21:39.483
Thank you for comin' to see me.

21:39.484 --> 21:41.283
- Yeah
- Blow it up.

21:48.652 --> 21:49.984
- I love you, man.

21:49.985 --> 21:51.519
- I love you, too.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.320
- Thank you so much.

21:55.320 --> 21:56.919
- You are the best.

21:56.920 --> 21:59.886
- You're the best, take care
of the karate class, okay?

21:59.887 --> 22:03.055
- Yes, yes, I will.
- Awesome.

22:04.488 --> 22:06.387
- When'd you get a mustache?

22:11.623 --> 22:13.955
- If you change that channel
one more time, woman.

22:13.956 --> 22:14.957
- Sorry.

22:14.958 --> 22:16.489
- There's seven channels.
- I know,

22:16.490 --> 22:18.490
they are all terrible.

22:18.524 --> 22:19.755
- I know.

22:19.756 --> 22:22.058
I should go.

22:23.791 --> 22:25.391
- Okay.

22:26.858 --> 22:28.391
- Are you sure it's okay?

22:28.392 --> 22:30.791
- Yeah.
- Like positive?

22:30.792 --> 22:32.492
- Ugh.

22:32.493 --> 22:35.260
Yeah, it's okay.

22:35.293 --> 22:36.792
- Bye.

22:36.793 --> 22:39.860
Bye.

22:41.228 --> 22:42.561
I'll see you later.

22:42.595 --> 22:45.028
See you later.

22:45.962 --> 22:49.927
I'm really busy, I have
a lot to do, so, bye.

23:33.803 --> 23:36.869
- She doesn't deserve this.

23:46.439 --> 23:49.737
- Sorry, I didn't mean to
disturb you, I'm sorry.

23:49.738 --> 23:51.905
- No, it's okay, you don't have to leave.

23:51.906 --> 23:54.306
There's plenty of space here.

24:01.207 --> 24:02.507
- I'm Michael.

24:02.508 --> 24:04.773
- Diana.

24:04.774 --> 24:06.507
- It's good to meet you.

24:06.508 --> 24:08.642
- Yeah, you too.

24:10.276 --> 24:14.676
So, do you like it here?

24:14.677 --> 24:16.543
- In the hospital?

24:16.544 --> 24:18.742
No one likes hospitals.

24:18.743 --> 24:20.210
It's not bad.

24:20.211 --> 24:23.943
- Yeah, my little girl's
not doing so well.

24:23.944 --> 24:25.911
- I'm sorry to hear that.

24:27.412 --> 24:28.978
How old is she?

24:28.979 --> 24:30.745
- She's five.

24:32.113 --> 24:35.679
I haven't been to church in two years.

24:35.680 --> 24:40.681
Now I'm here, selfishly begging for a
miracle.

24:40.780 --> 24:42.846
- Doesn't make you selfish.

24:42.847 --> 24:44.982
- Maybe God's punishing me.

24:50.983 --> 24:54.982
- There's this verse in the Bible

24:54.983 --> 24:59.450
and it says something about

24:59.451 --> 25:04.384
the sun rising on the good and the evil

25:04.385 --> 25:09.386
and the rain falling on
the just and the unjust.

25:11.785 --> 25:15.019
Bad things aren't just
happening to you and me,

25:15.020 --> 25:19.153
they're just happening.

25:21.388 --> 25:23.753
Like that makes it any better, right?

25:27.755 --> 25:30.555
Is there anything I can do for you?

25:30.556 --> 25:32.689
Besides prayer?

25:32.690 --> 25:37.023
- That's really sweet, but no thank you.

25:39.258 --> 25:42.557
It's already 9:30, um, I need to go

25:42.558 --> 25:45.057
or else I'm gonna miss my bus again.

25:45.058 --> 25:46.224
- Okay.

25:46.225 --> 25:48.224
- It was nice talking to you, Michael.

25:48.225 --> 25:50.692
- Good talking to you.

25:50.693 --> 25:55.692
Hey, um, do you need a car?

25:55.693 --> 25:57.593
- Sorry?

25:57.594 --> 26:00.560
- You said you were taking a
bus, do you not have a car?

26:00.561 --> 26:03.927
- No, we had to sell our car

26:03.928 --> 26:06.294
to pay for medical bills.

26:06.295 --> 26:08.761
When it rains, it pours, right?

26:08.762 --> 26:13.762
- Well, uh, if you can get past the smell

26:14.197 --> 26:18.197
and the color, and some other stuff,

26:19.697 --> 26:22.064
I think I can help you out.

26:23.598 --> 26:27.164
- Alright, guys, there she is.

26:27.165 --> 26:29.831
My boss says he'll keep
it gassed up for you guys

26:29.832 --> 26:32.332
and everything, how awesome is that thing?

26:32.333 --> 26:33.633
- That is amazing.

26:33.634 --> 26:35.132
- Let's hold back the excitement on giving
my van away.

26:35.133 --> 26:37.032
- I'm not excited, I'm not excited at all.

26:37.033 --> 26:38.866
Hey, I'm Michelle, nice to meet you

26:38.867 --> 26:42.000
- This is Jim and Diana.
- Hi, I'm Michelle

26:42.001 --> 26:44.967
Here's the keys.

26:44.968 --> 26:48.034
So, when do I get to
meet your little girl?

26:54.769 --> 26:57.471
- The Princess and the Pig.

27:07.772 --> 27:09.406
Is this for me?

27:17.007 --> 27:18.673
- Can I open it?

27:18.674 --> 27:21.941
- Now right now.
- Not right now?

27:23.275 --> 27:25.508
Thank you, that's so sweet.

27:28.509 --> 27:30.709
Bye.

27:37.977 --> 27:39.578
- See you later.

27:40.944 --> 27:43.477
- You're goofy.

27:43.478 --> 27:45.011
- How cool was that?

27:45.012 --> 27:47.311
- Yeah, that was fun.

27:47.312 --> 27:48.977
- If I had never gotten sick,

27:48.978 --> 27:51.246
I never would have met her.

27:52.246 --> 27:53.846
- Yeah.

27:55.513 --> 27:58.280
I mean, yeah, that part is good.

27:58.281 --> 27:59.748
- It is good.

28:00.780 --> 28:01.814
- Yep.

28:04.348 --> 28:06.548
We have to focus on what's good.

28:09.416 --> 28:12.282
- Yeah, you're right, I'm sorry.

28:12.283 --> 28:13.616
Sorry.

28:14.550 --> 28:16.049
- Like you know what else is good?

28:16.050 --> 28:17.416
- What?
- There's pork

28:17.417 --> 28:19.082
in the cafeteria today,

28:19.083 --> 28:21.184
pork in the cafeteria.
- Yeah, so good.

28:23.752 --> 28:25.217
- Alright, boys.

28:25.218 --> 28:28.118
I need starting O and a
scouty defense on the ball.

28:28.119 --> 28:29.817
We're gonna work on blitz pick up.

28:29.818 --> 28:32.719
- Hey, let's go boys, break it up.

28:32.720 --> 28:34.052
One, two, three.
- Hussle it.

28:34.053 --> 28:35.753
- Four, five, six.
- Never quit.

28:37.954 --> 28:39.620
- Come on, let's go, hustle.

28:39.621 --> 28:41.321
- Huddle.

28:42.154 --> 28:44.087
- Hey, man, how's your brother?

28:44.088 --> 28:45.787
- He's fine.
- I want you to know,

28:45.788 --> 28:47.622
I'm praying for him.

28:49.690 --> 28:51.555
- Alright, guys, let's go, Spartan left,

28:51.556 --> 28:53.522
37 lead toss, ready?

28:56.190 --> 28:57.190
- Come on, defense.

29:01.157 --> 29:04.225
Red, 28, red, 28, set hut.

29:08.825 --> 29:11.525
- Boyum, get up, man.

29:11.526 --> 29:13.693
Come on, defense,

29:13.694 --> 29:16.193
Get up, come here.

29:18.227 --> 29:20.460
- Hey, I know you got a
lot goin' on right now,

29:20.461 --> 29:22.060
and I understand where you're comin' from,

29:22.061 --> 29:24.360
but, man, hey, look at me,

29:24.361 --> 29:26.794
I need you here right now, alright?

29:26.795 --> 29:29.695
So get some water, take
a couple of plays off.

29:29.696 --> 29:32.195
Noctigal, you're goin' in for Boyum.

29:32.196 --> 29:33.929
Take five, come on.

29:39.531 --> 29:40.829
- Hey.

29:40.830 --> 29:42.397
- Hey, Matt.

29:42.398 --> 29:44.431
- What's wrong with your phone,
it's broken or something?

29:44.432 --> 29:46.064
- What do you mean?

29:46.065 --> 29:47.598
- You're not answering my calls.

29:47.599 --> 29:48.864
Trying to avoid me?

29:48.865 --> 29:50.533
- Sorry, it's just, um,

29:51.667 --> 29:53.831
you've been so busy with your
brother being sick and all,

29:53.832 --> 29:55.933
I didn't want to bother you.

29:55.967 --> 29:58.733
- Call me sometime, I miss you.

29:58.734 --> 30:01.199
- Been all those AP classes, you know?

30:01.200 --> 30:03.534
- Boyum.
- Yeah?

30:03.535 --> 30:05.734
- Let's go.
- Call me.

30:11.802 --> 30:14.103
- Dad and I wanna have a talk with you.

30:18.203 --> 30:19.771
- Okay?

30:19.772 --> 30:23.237
- Honey, we're just really
concerned about you.

30:23.238 --> 30:25.404
You're not getting enough rest.

30:25.405 --> 30:27.338
Your school work is suffering.

30:27.339 --> 30:30.238
- My boyfriend has cancer.

30:30.239 --> 30:31.405
What am I supposed to do?

30:31.406 --> 30:32.639
He needs me right now.

30:32.640 --> 30:34.606
- Look, you've gotta
give yourself a break,

30:34.607 --> 30:37.306
we don't like seeing you like this.

30:37.307 --> 30:39.040
- Like what?

30:39.041 --> 30:40.640
How am I supposed to be right now?

30:40.641 --> 30:42.073
I didn't know that this was gonna happen.

30:42.074 --> 30:45.207
I didn't expect, please
stop, just leave me alone.

30:45.208 --> 30:47.642
Leave my room, please.

30:48.941 --> 30:50.743
- Okay.

31:08.646 --> 31:11.011
- Here's the deal, my
room's gettin' boring,

31:11.012 --> 31:13.345
time for some Yahtzee, what do you say?

31:13.346 --> 31:15.212
- I've still got
five charts to finish here.

31:15.213 --> 31:17.912
- It can wait, Katie, please.

31:17.913 --> 31:22.782
- Get me out, I wanna
go home, I wanna go home.

31:23.881 --> 31:25.981
- Mr. Fenton, are you okay?

31:25.982 --> 31:27.214
You alright?

31:27.215 --> 31:29.782
Your family just left, you're okay.

31:29.783 --> 31:31.181
Just take a deep breath, it's fine.

31:31.182 --> 31:33.283
I'm Nurse Katie, remember?
- Where's my son?

31:34.150 --> 31:35.982
- I know, it's just the new
meds, you'll get used to 'em,

31:35.983 --> 31:39.216
don't worry, you're
alright, you're alright.

31:39.217 --> 31:41.051
You're alright.

32:04.722 --> 32:06.722
- Hi.

32:07.889 --> 32:09.288
I'm Michael.

32:09.289 --> 32:11.922
I'm from down the hall.

32:13.724 --> 32:15.222
- Michael.

32:15.223 --> 32:17.989
- Would it be alright if I
read to you for a little bit?

32:17.990 --> 32:21.257
This book always seems
to make me feel better.

32:21.258 --> 32:22.658
- Take it.

32:23.658 --> 32:25.190
- See if I can find something.

32:32.727 --> 32:35.392
"Look at the birds of the air,

32:35.393 --> 32:40.394
"they do not sow or reap
or store away in barns,

32:40.561 --> 32:43.226
"and yet your Heavenly Father feeds them.

32:43.227 --> 32:46.262
"Are you not much more
valuable than they?"

32:46.295 --> 32:48.662
- Don't.
- Who...

32:50.029 --> 32:52.430
- Don't you read to me that garbage.

32:59.164 --> 33:00.296
I'm gonna do you a favor

33:00.297 --> 33:03.364
and I'm gonna tell it
to you straight, okay?

33:03.365 --> 33:04.764
You've probably carried that Bible around

33:04.765 --> 33:08.432
and you just reads about
anyone that'll listen to ya.

33:08.433 --> 33:11.898
Probably even think your
Savin' souls, don't you?

33:11.899 --> 33:13.432
And maybe you think
that God put you in here

33:13.433 --> 33:18.300
so he'd give you a great
opportunity to reach others.

33:19.601 --> 33:22.467
But here's the one cruel irony,

33:22.468 --> 33:24.233
that unfortunately, you can't see with that

33:24.234 --> 33:27.569
young, naive mind of yours.

33:28.602 --> 33:32.202
The one who needs saving is you.

33:33.670 --> 33:35.536
Maybe that book you carry around

33:35.537 --> 33:38.637
makes you feel better about your situation,

33:38.638 --> 33:40.936
but I hope for your sake
that you start learning

33:40.937 --> 33:44.137
how to deal with your
problems in a real way,

33:44.138 --> 33:48.539
instead of hiding inside
of this fairy tale.

33:49.038 --> 33:53.106
- Uh, I've read fairy tales.

33:55.507 --> 33:57.006
Not a fairy tale.

33:57.007 --> 33:59.440
- Invisible creatures
in the air all around us

33:59.441 --> 34:02.007
fighting for our lost souls?

34:02.008 --> 34:05.074
And the only way to be
redeemed is by a blood sacrifice

34:05.075 --> 34:09.576
of a God come to Earth
and born of a virgin?

34:12.810 --> 34:15.110
That's some fairy tale, son.

34:17.110 --> 34:20.909
- I came in here to make you feel better.

34:20.911 --> 34:23.210
Looks like I did.

34:25.178 --> 34:28.746
It was nice meeting you,
you have a good night.

34:39.581 --> 34:42.281
- What if you're
wrong and God is real?

34:42.313 --> 34:44.047
How are you going to explain yourself

34:44.047 --> 34:45.482
to the Creator of the universe

34:45.514 --> 34:47.047
when all you've done is fight him?

34:47.047 --> 34:48.281
- I've tried to get a statue removed

34:48.282 --> 34:50.649
from the front of a courthouse, big deal.

34:50.650 --> 34:53.514
If anything, God would
need to explain Himself.

34:53.516 --> 34:55.248
- Like what?

34:55.248 --> 34:57.216
- Brain cancer in children?

34:57.217 --> 34:58.916
Why would he allow that?

34:58.917 --> 35:01.183
Babies born without their skulls?

35:01.184 --> 35:03.551
Why would a supreme being create a world

35:03.552 --> 35:07.150
that is filled with misery and pain

35:07.151 --> 35:09.251
and then try to blame it on us?

35:18.620 --> 35:20.087
And then I'm supposed to fall on my knees

35:20.088 --> 35:23.153
and worship this, this monster?

35:23.154 --> 35:27.655
No, if God is real, then
He's clearly a sadistic,

35:27.656 --> 35:30.823
blood-thirsty, evil
being, and doesn't deserve

35:30.855 --> 35:33.557
even the slightest praise from our lips.

36:41.601 --> 36:44.235
- I don't understand.

36:55.937 --> 36:58.969
- Hey, man, it's
James, I just wanted to call

36:58.970 --> 37:01.571
and let you know that mom, dad, and I

37:01.572 --> 37:03.170
are not going to be
able to make it to your

37:03.171 --> 37:05.471
away game tonight, um,

37:05.472 --> 37:07.472
Michael's not doing too good,

37:07.473 --> 37:09.705
so we're gonna head over there,

37:09.706 --> 37:13.306
but, uh, anyway, good luck, man.

37:13.307 --> 37:15.467
I know you're gonna kick
some Bison butt tonight, so...

37:41.344 --> 37:43.176
- Here we
go, Spartans, here we go.

37:43.177 --> 37:44.711
- Spartan left, 34 ISO.

37:44.712 --> 37:46.177
- Spartan left, 34 ISO. One to one.

37:46.178 --> 37:47.579
Ready!

37:52.012 --> 37:54.412
- Here we
go, Spartans, here we go.

38:09.683 --> 38:10.815
- Yeah.

38:10.816 --> 38:12.750
Time out, time out, time out.

38:46.589 --> 38:47.621
- Here's what we're gonna do,

38:47.622 --> 38:50.122
we're gonna go for two,
we've gotta punch this in.

38:50.123 --> 38:52.722
Win this in overtime, alright?

38:52.723 --> 38:55.323
Gun left, 17 ISO.

38:55.324 --> 38:57.189
Gotta run your tail off, bud.

38:57.190 --> 38:59.022
You have got to block hard, alright?

38:59.023 --> 39:00.922
It's the only way it's gonna work.

39:00.923 --> 39:02.257
Let's win this thing.

39:02.258 --> 39:03.657
Get in here, Spartans on three.

39:03.658 --> 39:05.657
One, two, three.
- Spartans!

41:27.215 --> 41:29.281
- Hello there.

41:29.282 --> 41:32.449
Hey, you, uh, barged into my room,

41:32.450 --> 41:35.016
so I thought I'd come
and barge into yours.

41:36.717 --> 41:38.750
- What can I do for you?

41:38.751 --> 41:40.383
- Look, I brought you
some reading material,

41:40.384 --> 41:44.084
since you sit here all day
with your nose in that fairy tale.

41:44.085 --> 41:45.851
These are awesome books.

41:45.852 --> 41:48.751
Stephen Hawking, "A
Brief History of Time",

41:48.752 --> 41:51.685
Richard Dawkins, "The Magic of Reality",

41:51.686 --> 41:53.353
and, of course, my favorite

41:53.386 --> 41:55.787
is Carl Sagan, "Cosmos".

41:55.788 --> 41:57.353
- I've read 'em.

41:57.354 --> 41:59.820
- You've read 'em and you
still read that garbage?

41:59.821 --> 42:02.855
- Interesting theories by brilliant men.

42:04.455 --> 42:07.522
Obviously, I don't agree with everything,

42:07.523 --> 42:09.489
but when I read those books,

42:10.989 --> 42:13.756
it reminds me what a great
creator God really is.

42:13.757 --> 42:16.055
Dude.

42:16.056 --> 42:17.589
- Listen, right now is not the best time

42:17.590 --> 42:20.323
for a theological debate.

42:20.324 --> 42:22.825
Maybe we can try another day.

42:24.591 --> 42:27.892
- 'Cause the little girl died.

42:27.893 --> 42:29.659
I'm sorry.

42:31.260 --> 42:34.058
I know she meant a lot to you.

42:34.059 --> 42:37.193
But she is in heaven, right?

42:37.194 --> 42:39.828
I mean, that's what you believe.

42:40.895 --> 42:42.126
- Yep.

42:45.928 --> 42:48.495
Doesn't mean I understand it.

42:49.530 --> 42:53.796
- It hurts when a fairy
tale starts to crumble away.

42:53.797 --> 42:57.430
- You may not have the same beliefs,

42:57.431 --> 42:59.263
and you might think I'm a wishful thinker,

42:59.264 --> 43:01.798
and that I'm naive,

43:01.799 --> 43:04.831
but you tell me what's harder to believe,

43:04.832 --> 43:07.765
that our finely-tuned
universe that we live in,

43:07.766 --> 43:10.064
full of life, means nothing?

43:10.065 --> 43:12.532
Or that God is given it
more purpose than you

43:12.533 --> 43:15.734
and your books can even
begin to understand?

43:18.133 --> 43:20.668
He's the most brilliant mind.

43:22.034 --> 43:24.435
- We don't have to talk.

43:25.602 --> 43:27.736
Can we just play dice?

43:29.536 --> 43:32.068
- You play Yahtzee?

43:32.069 --> 43:34.603
- I'll kick your butt.

43:41.504 --> 43:43.772
- Yahtzee.

43:45.005 --> 43:46.204
- Impossible.

43:46.205 --> 43:47.371
- It's not impossible.

43:47.372 --> 43:48.704
- No, you're changing out the dice.

43:48.705 --> 43:49.906
- I swear to you, I'm not.

43:49.907 --> 43:53.206
- Oh, I doubt you swear.

43:54.106 --> 43:56.239
- Maybe, it's God telling
you that I'm right.

43:56.240 --> 43:57.873
- Ha!

43:57.874 --> 44:02.574
- So, how long have you
been a non-believer?

44:02.575 --> 44:04.240
- A free-thinker, you mean?

44:04.241 --> 44:06.674
- Okay, how long have
you been a free-thinker?

44:06.675 --> 44:09.743
- Believe it or not, I
was once naive like you.

44:10.543 --> 44:11.743
- So what changed ya?

44:14.943 --> 44:16.743
- If I had to pinpoint it on one thing,

44:16.744 --> 44:19.510
I'd say it was the war.

44:19.511 --> 44:22.812
I came home and my marriage
quickly fell apart.

44:24.044 --> 44:26.479
I bought a cabin by the lake,

44:27.579 --> 44:30.812
took up carving, I tried
to forget those images

44:30.813 --> 44:33.146
that were burned in my brain.

44:34.814 --> 44:38.146
I used to think God was
this all-powerful being

44:38.147 --> 44:42.916
who looked after us,
but now I know better.

44:44.081 --> 44:47.515
The only one who's looking
after you, Michael, is you.

44:49.917 --> 44:52.182
- It's a pretty sad outlook on life.

44:52.183 --> 44:55.283
- It's just the truth.

44:55.284 --> 44:56.650
- Not for me, it isn't.

44:56.651 --> 44:57.917
- Oh, yeah?

44:57.918 --> 44:59.883
And what makes you so special?

44:59.884 --> 45:01.818
- I'm not saying I'm special.

45:01.819 --> 45:05.851
My life is no more or less
amazing than anybody else's,

45:05.852 --> 45:10.853
but everywhere I look, I
can see God's handiwork.

45:11.519 --> 45:12.952
In everything.

45:12.953 --> 45:14.886
- You know what they call that, Michael?

45:14.887 --> 45:18.553
They call that "confirmation bias."

45:18.554 --> 45:20.454
You see anything that you want to see,

45:20.455 --> 45:22.654
and when it does not
fit in your little box,

45:22.655 --> 45:24.487
you reject it.

45:24.488 --> 45:25.788
- I know what you're gettin' at, okay?

45:25.789 --> 45:28.721
Yes, humans are pattern-seekers
who see shapes in clouds

45:28.722 --> 45:31.189
and Jesus' face in potato chips.

45:31.190 --> 45:35.122
That's fine, but,

45:35.123 --> 45:37.323
haven't you ever had something

45:37.324 --> 45:40.623
happen to you where you knew that it had

45:40.624 --> 45:41.890
nothing to do with chance.

45:41.891 --> 45:44.758
That it had something to do with

45:44.759 --> 45:47.559
something greater than you?

45:48.725 --> 45:50.859
- In the world of random chance,

45:50.860 --> 45:52.892
things are bound to happen.

45:52.893 --> 45:54.358
- So nothing then?

45:54.359 --> 45:55.626
- Nothing what?

45:55.627 --> 45:57.561
- Nothing greater than you?

46:00.060 --> 46:01.861
- When we get out of this place,

46:01.862 --> 46:04.427
you're comin' with me up to my cabin,

46:04.428 --> 46:05.727
and after we catch our dinner,

46:05.728 --> 46:08.295
we're gonna carve away
on a couple of blocks

46:08.296 --> 46:13.062
as the sun sets on the
waters smooth as glass,

46:13.063 --> 46:16.062
and when the last rays of
sunlight hits your face,

46:16.063 --> 46:19.163
you're gonna get the
calls of a thousand voices

46:19.164 --> 46:22.697
that maybe you forgot shared

46:22.698 --> 46:26.097
this random, chaotic, painful,

46:26.098 --> 46:28.866
beautiful world with us.

46:32.066 --> 46:33.965
- Sounds good.

46:33.966 --> 46:35.632
- Then it's set then?

46:35.633 --> 46:36.633
- It's set.

46:36.634 --> 46:38.567
- You're gonna have to give
me a couple of weeks, though.

46:38.568 --> 46:41.266
I've been in this place too stinkin' long

46:41.267 --> 46:44.100
and who knows what it looks like now.

46:49.169 --> 46:51.202
- Gah, this
game does not agree with me.

46:51.203 --> 46:53.335
- No, it doesn't.

46:53.336 --> 46:55.470
- Can we pick up on it later?

46:55.471 --> 46:57.136
- Yeah.

46:57.137 --> 47:01.270
- Ya know, Michael,

47:01.271 --> 47:02.504
science does have a answer

47:02.505 --> 47:06.437
to how we live in such
a finely-tuned universe.

47:06.438 --> 47:08.205
You ever heard of quantum mechanics?

47:08.206 --> 47:09.538
- I've heard of it.
- Yeah.

47:09.539 --> 47:12.271
It predicts an infinite
number of universes

47:12.272 --> 47:14.940
with different properties in each one.

47:14.941 --> 47:17.841
Most are empty of life.

47:19.074 --> 47:21.006
This one works.

47:21.007 --> 47:23.607
So, maybe there's an alternate universe

47:23.608 --> 47:27.909
where you and I are playing
Yahtzee cancer-free.

47:27.943 --> 47:31.076
- And I whip your butt every game.

47:36.076 --> 47:38.210
- An infinite number of universes

47:38.211 --> 47:41.443
with an infinite number of possibilities

47:41.444 --> 47:44.512
and you're saying there's no room for God?

47:48.947 --> 47:52.580
- There is no miracle, son, I'm sorry.

47:53.880 --> 47:56.513
I wish I was wrong about that,

47:56.514 --> 47:58.580
but I'm not.

48:21.451 --> 48:22.451
- Hey, guys.

48:22.452 --> 48:24.016
- Hey, Dr. McAlpine.

48:24.017 --> 48:25.918
- Well, I thought I was comin' in here

48:25.919 --> 48:28.218
today to give you guys some bad news,

48:28.219 --> 48:29.585
to tell you that the second round

48:29.586 --> 48:31.386
of chemotherapy had failed,

48:31.420 --> 48:34.386
but, actually, it is pretty remarkable.

48:34.420 --> 48:37.086
I've never seen anything
like this in my career.

48:37.087 --> 48:39.854
Yesterday, your blast cells were at 80%

48:39.855 --> 48:42.086
and today, this morning's tests,

48:42.087 --> 48:44.222
and I double-checked these tests.

48:45.988 --> 48:48.322
You're in complete remission.

48:49.556 --> 48:52.388
Now, there's a pretty
good chance of relapse,

48:52.389 --> 48:56.256
so we need to start planning
for a bone marrow transplant.

48:56.257 --> 48:57.890
That planning means we need to find

48:57.891 --> 49:00.657
the best possible match for Michael,

49:00.658 --> 49:05.558
but for right now, get outta here.

49:06.625 --> 49:09.024
You can go home.

50:17.704 --> 50:21.504
- I cannot wait to go on
a proper date with you.

50:21.505 --> 50:23.203
We can go to the movie theater

50:23.204 --> 50:26.004
and we can buy one of those
really big buckets of popcorn

50:26.005 --> 50:29.204
and just drench it in butter,
and buy all the candy...

50:29.205 --> 50:30.873
- That's such a good idea,

50:30.874 --> 50:32.906
because nothing says, "I just beat cancer"

50:32.907 --> 50:34.539
than going into cardiac arrest.

50:34.540 --> 50:37.974
- Hey, you can bring Sheila,
we could make it a double-date.

50:37.975 --> 50:40.875
- No, no, no, I don't
wanna intrude, you guys go.

50:42.441 --> 50:44.208
- What's wrong?

50:45.442 --> 50:48.810
- Do you guys wanna do
something really cool?

51:15.146 --> 51:17.145
- Hi, I'm Michelle.
- Tony,

51:17.146 --> 51:19.146
it's nice to meet you.

51:19.147 --> 51:20.514
- Michael.
- Yeah, hi.

51:20.515 --> 51:22.113
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you.

51:22.114 --> 51:23.347
- I just wanna say it's really great

51:23.348 --> 51:25.581
what you're doing for my
dad, I'm really happy,

51:25.582 --> 51:26.582
this is awesome.

51:26.582 --> 51:27.582
- You wanna get started?

51:27.583 --> 51:29.314
- Yeah, hang on just a second.

51:29.315 --> 51:30.816
- Alright, guys, come on out.

51:49.386 --> 51:54.119
♫ Hey, I'm dreamin' again

51:55.487 --> 52:00.487
♫ It's just like you to
see everything I want to be

52:02.989 --> 52:07.856
♫ I am awake at last

52:09.456 --> 52:11.889
♫ I see my path

52:11.890 --> 52:16.189
♫ waitin' right in front of me

52:16.190 --> 52:19.323
♫ For

52:19.324 --> 52:23.123
♫ you to

52:23.124 --> 52:25.925
♫ Make what you make of it

52:25.926 --> 52:29.424
♫ as the morning light breaks

52:29.425 --> 52:32.259
♫ You gotta live your life

52:32.260 --> 52:36.793
♫ like there's no tomorrow

52:36.794 --> 52:40.593
♫ Make what you make of it

52:40.594 --> 52:44.160
♫ to light the fire, oh so beautiful

52:44.161 --> 52:45.561
♫ Make through the day

52:45.562 --> 52:50.563
♫ just like there's no tomorrow

52:53.129 --> 52:55.297
♫ Wonderful day

53:05.532 --> 53:08.298
- Today was a good day.

53:08.299 --> 53:10.165
- I agree.

53:38.037 --> 53:41.404
- Dr. McAlpine, he said
I'd probably relapse.

53:43.205 --> 53:46.638
- I just really, really thought
that it was gone for good.

53:46.639 --> 53:48.305
- Me too.

53:53.773 --> 53:56.473
- God gave us that miracle
and then, it's like,

53:56.474 --> 53:58.707
he just took it away.

54:00.374 --> 54:03.475
I just don't understand what He's doing.

54:05.074 --> 54:08.975
I mean, all the people in that hospital,

54:08.976 --> 54:11.775
all of the children, Annalisa, why?

54:11.776 --> 54:13.342
Why can't He just save everyone?

54:13.343 --> 54:14.409
- I don't know.
- Why?

54:14.410 --> 54:16.576
Isn't that what you would do?

54:16.577 --> 54:18.645
I just don't get it.

54:20.945 --> 54:22.244
- Come here.

54:25.112 --> 54:26.913
Let me show you something.

54:27.879 --> 54:29.978
You see that right there?

54:29.979 --> 54:31.879
- What am I looking at?

54:31.880 --> 54:33.546
- This.

54:33.547 --> 54:37.381
This little paint chip
is our time on Earth.

54:38.915 --> 54:43.181
And all this paint, all of it,

54:55.584 --> 54:57.317
is eternity.

54:58.918 --> 55:00.817
- What does that mean?

55:00.818 --> 55:03.984
- Our time on Earth is a blink

55:03.985 --> 55:06.051
to the rest of it.

55:07.553 --> 55:10.218
Death isn't the end of my journey.

55:10.219 --> 55:12.452
- Don't say death, Michael,
please don't say death.

55:12.453 --> 55:14.052
You're not gonna die, okay?

55:14.053 --> 55:19.053
- I'm not sayin' that, I'm
not, it's just perspective.

55:19.054 --> 55:22.353
That gives me peace.

55:22.354 --> 55:25.088
I don't want to be afraid
through all of this.

55:27.322 --> 55:30.957
- I understand that completely.

55:32.823 --> 55:37.490
Can we just try to stay positive, please?

55:37.491 --> 55:39.890
I know that the bone marrow
transplant is going to work,

55:39.891 --> 55:42.491
I know it is, so we don't have to have all

55:42.492 --> 55:44.925
these eternity talks, okay?

55:44.926 --> 55:46.425
- Yeah.

55:54.894 --> 55:57.494
I've got somethin' worth fighting for.

56:09.229 --> 56:10.596
What?

56:11.496 --> 56:14.596
- Stupid, stupid pigmobile.

56:14.597 --> 56:17.629
Why'd you have to use the pigmobile?

56:17.630 --> 56:18.998
Couldn't you have used, like,

56:19.032 --> 56:21.565
the stars in the sky or something?

56:25.033 --> 56:27.331
- Yeah, that probably
would have been better.

56:27.332 --> 56:28.831
- Because I see this one up there

56:28.832 --> 56:32.332
and it's a hunter with a bow.

56:32.333 --> 56:33.699
- Oh.
- Shooting

56:33.700 --> 56:35.465
an octopus.
- Yeah, you're good.

56:35.466 --> 56:37.099
That's funny.

56:37.100 --> 56:38.301
- Stop.

56:59.771 --> 57:03.103
Hey.

57:03.104 --> 57:04.971
- Hey, dude.

57:04.972 --> 57:07.572
- Whatcha doin'?

57:07.573 --> 57:09.606
- Just lookin'.

57:11.139 --> 57:12.539
- If you're lookin' for that geocache,

57:12.540 --> 57:15.306
that was further down that way.

57:15.307 --> 57:17.540
Treasure, nerd stuff.

57:22.408 --> 57:24.342
You okay?

57:27.009 --> 57:28.943
- Sheila and I broke up.

57:29.742 --> 57:30.944
- What?

57:32.610 --> 57:34.342
I'm sorry to hear that.

57:34.343 --> 57:36.477
- So, whatever.

57:39.045 --> 57:41.176
- I've got dinner at the house

57:41.177 --> 57:42.778
if you wanna come eat?

57:42.779 --> 57:45.946
- I'm alright, man, I'll come in a bit.

57:48.078 --> 57:50.879
- I feel so blessed that this,

57:50.880 --> 57:53.245
the bone marrow's comin' from you.

57:53.246 --> 57:55.047
- You just think James
is a pansy, don't you?

57:55.048 --> 57:57.580
- Total pansy, huge pansy.

57:57.581 --> 58:01.080
- Nah, man, I'm glad I could help.

58:01.081 --> 58:03.847
- See you at the house.

58:09.883 --> 58:11.883
- I need this to work, Mike.

58:15.350 --> 58:17.649
I just feel like life
keeps kicking me down

58:17.650 --> 58:19.584
and down and down and every time

58:19.585 --> 58:21.350
I try to get back up and fight it,

58:21.351 --> 58:25.185
it sweeps me under the rug.

58:28.919 --> 58:30.820
I need it to work.

58:34.520 --> 58:36.153
What are we havin'?

58:37.187 --> 58:38.554
- Ribs.

58:39.754 --> 58:41.988
Ribs, pork, whatever you want.

58:42.989 --> 58:44.555
Come on.

58:47.255 --> 58:51.255
- There he is, there he is.

58:51.256 --> 58:52.789
How you feelin'?

58:52.790 --> 58:54.456
- I feel great.

58:54.457 --> 58:56.156
- You look great, bro.

58:56.157 --> 58:58.823
Bone marrow day, bone marrow day,

58:58.824 --> 59:00.524
bone marrow day.

59:00.525 --> 59:02.525
- Hey, I have a little
present from the munchkins.

59:04.592 --> 59:05.958
- Yeah, yeah, look at that.

59:05.959 --> 59:06.960
- Can't even spell.

59:06.961 --> 59:08.625
- Alright, this is it.

59:08.626 --> 59:10.525
- There it is, right there.

59:10.526 --> 59:12.726
- Ladies and gentleman,
that is what the inside

59:12.727 --> 59:14.926
of Matt Boyum looks like, disgusting.

59:14.927 --> 59:15.993
- How does this work?

59:15.994 --> 59:17.392
You just plug it in and then it goes right

59:17.393 --> 59:18.394
into his veins?

59:18.395 --> 59:20.027
- Yep, and once it hits his blood stream,

59:20.028 --> 59:21.894
it'll start to pick up
his brother's traits.

59:21.895 --> 59:23.293
- That's right, he'll be better looking,

59:23.294 --> 59:25.261
he'll be more handsome, he'll be smarter.

59:25.262 --> 59:26.962
- Making women uncomfortable,

59:26.963 --> 59:28.328
these are things I'm looking forward to.

59:28.329 --> 59:31.128
- Ladies, Matt Boyum, here.

59:31.129 --> 59:32.796
My older brother, he
needed something from me,

59:32.797 --> 59:35.128
I gave, I stepped up,
you remember this face.

59:35.129 --> 59:36.598
- Cha-ching.

59:39.598 --> 59:41.630
- Once I finish up here,
in about 15 minutes,

59:41.631 --> 59:42.931
it'll all be in.

59:42.932 --> 59:45.398
- Matt Boyum, you're my hero.

59:52.967 --> 59:54.434
- Get the nurse.

59:58.334 --> 01:00:00.801
- Katie, Michael's burning up in there,

01:00:00.802 --> 01:00:02.001
he needs your help.

01:00:02.002 --> 01:00:03.968
- He'll get his next
dose in about 30 minutes.

01:00:03.969 --> 01:00:07.069
- No, not in 30 minutes,

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:10.035
you're gonna help him right now.

01:00:10.036 --> 01:00:11.435
- I can get you some cold towels,

01:00:11.436 --> 01:00:13.136
but that's all I can do.

01:01:08.946 --> 01:01:11.445
- You wanna get out of here?

01:01:11.446 --> 01:01:12.646
- Hm?

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:17.081
Are you okay, do you need something?

01:01:19.082 --> 01:01:22.580
- We were at prom,

01:01:22.581 --> 01:01:24.949
we were dancing.

01:01:29.749 --> 01:01:33.850
And then I twirled you and
you looked so beautiful.

01:01:39.117 --> 01:01:41.818
You wore that red dress.

01:01:46.185 --> 01:01:47.951
So beautiful.

01:02:47.062 --> 01:02:48.796
- Wow.

01:02:58.197 --> 01:03:00.065
Stay still.

01:03:01.665 --> 01:03:03.365
You okay?

01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:07.733
- You have to dance with me.

01:03:09.265 --> 01:03:12.132
That dress is too good to pass up.

01:04:45.949 --> 01:04:47.115
- Can I come in?

01:04:47.116 --> 01:04:48.782
- Yeah, absolutely.

01:04:48.783 --> 01:04:51.215
- You look fantastic.
- Thank you.

01:04:51.216 --> 01:04:52.882
- You look great.

01:04:52.883 --> 01:04:54.216
What day are you at?

01:04:54.217 --> 01:04:55.950
- 100.

01:04:55.951 --> 01:04:58.282
- 100?
- Yeah.

01:04:58.283 --> 01:05:00.550
- That's good, that's good.

01:05:00.551 --> 01:05:02.217
You're almost free.

01:05:02.218 --> 01:05:04.651
- Almost.
- [Mr. Fenton) You know,

01:05:04.652 --> 01:05:08.352
I want to thank you for what
you did up at the cabin.

01:05:08.386 --> 01:05:11.151
- Tony, he wasn't supposed to tell you.

01:05:11.152 --> 01:05:14.252
- I know, he was never
good at keeping secrets.

01:05:14.253 --> 01:05:15.686
- Apparently not.

01:05:15.687 --> 01:05:18.088
- I got a little surprise for you.

01:05:27.455 --> 01:05:32.155
- Wow, this is beautiful.

01:05:32.156 --> 01:05:34.389
- Oh, no, you're not converting me.

01:05:36.058 --> 01:05:38.657
I also carve unicorns and fairies.

01:05:38.658 --> 01:05:40.289
- Fairy tale stuff, right.

01:05:40.290 --> 01:05:42.891
- You're a good kid, Michael.

01:05:42.892 --> 01:05:45.290
Go conquer the world.

01:05:57.061 --> 01:05:59.226
- You're next.

01:05:59.227 --> 01:06:02.595
- Yeah, you can count on it.

01:06:14.497 --> 01:06:16.629
- Dear Heavenly Father, we are so thankful

01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:18.698
that you've healed Michael.

01:06:18.731 --> 01:06:21.463
Let his life testify to your faithfulness.

01:06:21.464 --> 01:06:23.898
You are the great Healer.

01:06:23.899 --> 01:06:26.399
In Jesus' Name we pray, Amen.

01:06:28.999 --> 01:06:32.565
- I would like to propose a toast

01:06:32.566 --> 01:06:35.332
to the bone marrow king of Minnesota,

01:06:35.333 --> 01:06:37.199
my dear brother, Matt.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.240
- Hey, that is Mr. King Bone Marrow
to you, alright?

01:06:43.602 --> 01:06:45.467
- I would like to say a prayer.

01:06:45.468 --> 01:06:47.300
- Uh, mom, dad just prayed.

01:06:47.301 --> 01:06:49.468
- Well, I would like to add something.

01:06:49.469 --> 01:06:51.770
- Matt, you need more prayer!

01:06:51.803 --> 01:06:53.236
- That I do!

01:06:53.269 --> 01:06:57.736
Thank you, Lord, for bringing
Michelle into our lives.

01:06:57.737 --> 01:07:00.804
She's a beautiful gift to this family.

01:07:00.805 --> 01:07:03.071
May you continue to bless her

01:07:03.072 --> 01:07:07.572
in everything she does, Amen.

01:07:10.106 --> 01:07:11.639
- I love you, guys.

01:07:14.507 --> 01:07:16.041
- Let's eat.

01:07:17.007 --> 01:07:18.340
Let's start with the beef.

01:07:18.341 --> 01:07:19.674
- Beef.

01:07:22.474 --> 01:07:25.876
- Don't answer your phone
at the table, that's rude.

01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:28.641
- Hi, this is Michael.

01:07:28.642 --> 01:07:29.642
- Alright.

01:07:29.643 --> 01:07:30.943
- Okay, hey.

01:07:34.543 --> 01:07:35.576
What?

01:07:46.378 --> 01:07:48.245
- Michael, who is it?

01:07:48.246 --> 01:07:50.113
- Uh, what does that mean?

01:08:03.214 --> 01:08:08.049
- Okay, thank you.

01:08:08.050 --> 01:08:10.150
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:08:11.482 --> 01:08:13.117
What'd he say?

01:08:14.417 --> 01:08:16.151
What'd he say?

01:08:17.151 --> 01:08:18.582
What did he say?

01:08:19.585 --> 01:08:21.017
- No, no, no, no.

01:08:21.018 --> 01:08:22.250
No, no.

01:08:26.752 --> 01:08:31.352
- I don't understand, you
just got out of there.

01:08:31.353 --> 01:08:33.787
You just got out of there.

01:08:36.453 --> 01:08:38.319
- Oh, honey.

01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:42.388
- Hey.

01:08:49.523 --> 01:08:51.555
I won't quit fighting.

01:08:52.555 --> 01:08:55.890
- I was really starting to
get used to this idea of, uh,

01:08:56.957 --> 01:09:01.957
this healing God that
you talk about so much.

01:09:04.892 --> 01:09:06.160
- Matt.

01:09:31.462 --> 01:09:35.529
- Hey, Matt.

01:09:37.165 --> 01:09:39.098
What are you doing?

01:09:40.596 --> 01:09:42.066
Come here.

01:09:45.532 --> 01:09:47.265
- I can't.

01:09:48.265 --> 01:09:50.299
- Yes, you can.

01:09:52.167 --> 01:09:53.934
- There's no point.

01:09:54.734 --> 01:09:58.967
- Matt, listen to me, I
know that this is bad, okay,

01:09:59.902 --> 01:10:02.534
and yes, my cancer's back, and yes...

01:10:02.535 --> 01:10:05.703
- It's not always about you, Mike!

01:10:07.536 --> 01:10:10.102
I have pain, too, I hurt, too,

01:10:10.103 --> 01:10:14.236
but everyone looks at you and
they feel so sorry for you.

01:10:15.570 --> 01:10:19.071
I struggle, too, but no one cares.

01:10:19.072 --> 01:10:22.905
- I care, Matt, I care.

01:10:24.006 --> 01:10:26.671
And mom, and James, and
dad, we all love you.

01:10:26.672 --> 01:10:28.705
Please can't you see that?

01:10:28.706 --> 01:10:30.338
- So much so that you didn't even know

01:10:30.339 --> 01:10:32.206
I quit the team.

01:10:33.074 --> 01:10:34.940
- You quit the team?

01:10:36.708 --> 01:10:39.040
Matt, I'm sorry, okay?

01:10:39.041 --> 01:10:40.206
I'm sorry you were overlooked

01:10:40.207 --> 01:10:41.974
and it's not going to happen again.

01:10:41.975 --> 01:10:43.075
- Just tell mom and dad I...

01:10:43.076 --> 01:10:45.175
- No, stop it, please, don't do this.

01:10:45.176 --> 01:10:46.541
- Tell 'em I love 'em, alright?

01:10:46.542 --> 01:10:48.809
- Mattie, please stop.

01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:52.408
No, no, Matt.

01:10:52.409 --> 01:10:55.210
- Stop, stop.

01:10:57.178 --> 01:10:59.844
Tell James, "I'm so
sorry that I wasn't there

01:10:59.845 --> 01:11:01.777
"to watch him grow up."

01:11:01.778 --> 01:11:04.144
Tell him I'm sorry.

01:11:04.145 --> 01:11:05.611
- No, please, get down.

01:11:05.612 --> 01:11:07.245
Get down.

01:11:10.245 --> 01:11:12.612
Jesus loves you, Matt.

01:11:12.613 --> 01:11:14.279
Jesus loves you.

01:11:17.881 --> 01:11:20.047
- What's in your blood?

01:11:20.048 --> 01:11:22.748
What's in my head?

01:11:25.415 --> 01:11:28.182
Don't be ridiculous.

01:11:28.183 --> 01:11:29.449
- It's not.

01:11:30.717 --> 01:11:34.016
He loves you more than
you know, I promise you.

01:11:34.017 --> 01:11:36.283
- Then where is He?

01:11:43.086 --> 01:11:45.685
- Where are you?

01:11:48.187 --> 01:11:50.519
Where are you?

01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:55.887
- He's right here.

01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:04.421
Matt, God sacrificed
for you, for your life.

01:12:07.023 --> 01:12:09.322
Just like you sacrificed for me.

01:12:11.456 --> 01:12:13.490
Now, it's my turn.

01:12:14.157 --> 01:12:16.656
Let me fight for you, please.

01:12:52.730 --> 01:12:54.031
- I'm sorry.

01:12:59.998 --> 01:13:01.665
I'm sorry.

01:13:16.034 --> 01:13:20.201
- Hey, hey, you about ready for a break?

01:13:20.202 --> 01:13:24.701
- Hi, uh, yeah, yeah,
Michael's been asleep

01:13:24.702 --> 01:13:28.935
for, like, 30 minutes, so he's
due for some Lorazepam soon

01:13:28.936 --> 01:13:30.769
and make sure that...

01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:32.635
- What's goin' on?

01:13:32.636 --> 01:13:34.569
- Oh, you're dad's
here, so I'm taking off.

01:13:34.570 --> 01:13:37.170
- No, just stay for like, stay
for like, 30 more minutes.

01:13:37.171 --> 01:13:39.970
- No, I can't, Michael, I
have a lot that I need to do.

01:13:39.971 --> 01:13:42.205
- It's just 30 minutes.

01:13:42.206 --> 01:13:45.071
- I'm sorry.
- Really?

01:13:45.072 --> 01:13:49.207
- Yeah, I can't be here
every night, Michael.

01:13:50.439 --> 01:13:53.371
I just can't, I have a life of my own

01:13:53.372 --> 01:13:54.906
that I have to catch up on.

01:13:54.907 --> 01:13:56.573
Please don't make me feel guilty about it.

01:13:56.574 --> 01:13:58.272
- I'm not trying to make
you feel guilty about it.

01:13:58.273 --> 01:13:59.640
- Well, you're making me feel really,

01:13:59.641 --> 01:14:01.641
really guilty about it.
- I was asking...

01:14:25.579 --> 01:14:30.546
♫ I remember you kindly

01:14:32.847 --> 01:14:37.380
♫ the promise you made

01:14:38.748 --> 01:14:42.181
♫ hold

01:14:42.182 --> 01:14:46.914
♫ gracefully

01:14:46.915 --> 01:14:51.316
♫ you won't be alone

01:14:52.249 --> 01:14:56.083
♫ for long

01:14:56.084 --> 01:15:00.251
♫ I'm with you ♫

01:15:02.318 --> 01:15:05.485
- Uh, could you give us a minute?

01:15:05.486 --> 01:15:07.619
- Sure.

01:15:18.421 --> 01:15:20.854
- Marry me?

01:15:20.855 --> 01:15:22.554
- What?

01:15:24.756 --> 01:15:26.756
- I love you.

01:15:28.255 --> 01:15:31.056
Every time that I'm with you

01:15:31.057 --> 01:15:33.124
my heart still skips a beat.

01:15:34.690 --> 01:15:37.423
You are the only person that I've ever met

01:15:37.424 --> 01:15:41.725
who I can just talk to for
hours and hours and hours

01:15:41.759 --> 01:15:44.257
and time just disappears.

01:15:46.825 --> 01:15:48.925
You make me laugh and you make me smile

01:15:48.926 --> 01:15:51.892
and you are just the
most incredible person

01:15:51.893 --> 01:15:54.826
that I have ever met in my entire life.

01:15:54.827 --> 01:15:59.160
You are a man of so much
faith and so much integrity

01:15:59.161 --> 01:16:02.628
and you have my heart
like nobody else does.

01:16:04.195 --> 01:16:08.862
And I swear, I swear I am a strong woman,

01:16:08.863 --> 01:16:11.629
but when it comes to you, I just turn into

01:16:11.630 --> 01:16:14.763
this weak, pathetic,

01:16:14.764 --> 01:16:17.797
weird, awkward girl

01:16:17.798 --> 01:16:21.531
and it's dumb, it's dumb, but,

01:16:22.931 --> 01:16:24.198
but, uh,

01:16:25.632 --> 01:16:29.533
I just want you desperately.

01:16:32.933 --> 01:16:35.900
- There's no guarantee with me.

01:16:35.901 --> 01:16:37.434
- I know.

01:16:39.367 --> 01:16:40.868
- I love you.

01:16:42.102 --> 01:16:43.835
- I love you.

01:16:45.835 --> 01:16:48.069
- But you deserve someone who is going

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:49.869
to be with you.

01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:53.937
- I deserve, I deserve you.

01:16:56.071 --> 01:16:57.170
You are my soulmate.

01:16:57.171 --> 01:16:59.470
Remember, you told me that.

01:16:59.471 --> 01:17:01.771
You told me that and I believed that

01:17:01.772 --> 01:17:04.138
and, yeah, I really, really,
really want to get away

01:17:04.139 --> 01:17:06.905
from all of this, too,
because this really sucks.

01:17:06.906 --> 01:17:08.672
This really sucks.

01:17:10.305 --> 01:17:15.305
But you're a part of me
and I'm a part of you

01:17:15.306 --> 01:17:19.274
and I know that we belong together.

01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:32.843
- I can't.

01:17:34.877 --> 01:17:36.878
I'm really tired.

01:17:38.978 --> 01:17:41.211
Can we talk about this later?

01:17:43.146 --> 01:17:45.311
Some other time?

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:10.782
- I don't think I can do this again, mom.

01:18:46.855 --> 01:18:49.322
- What are you up to?

01:18:53.357 --> 01:18:57.158
I have always trusted that
you had a plan for me.

01:18:59.658 --> 01:19:00.691
Is this it?

01:19:01.625 --> 01:19:03.423
Is this it?

01:19:03.424 --> 01:19:06.424
Attached to this for the rest of my life?

01:19:06.425 --> 01:19:08.491
How am I supposed to make a promise to her

01:19:08.492 --> 01:19:12.593
when I have no idea how much
time I have left to give her?

01:19:14.094 --> 01:19:16.527
- No one knows how much time we have.

01:19:21.294 --> 01:19:26.195
I'm sorry, son, but it looked
like you needed some answers.

01:19:26.196 --> 01:19:27.694
And I know you aren't
going to hear anything

01:19:27.695 --> 01:19:29.563
from up there.

01:19:30.763 --> 01:19:35.363
You're sick, yes, but in
a way, we're all sick,

01:19:35.364 --> 01:19:39.563
always marching toward
our inevitable conclusion.

01:19:39.564 --> 01:19:41.232
You could be free of cancer today

01:19:41.266 --> 01:19:45.064
and drive away from this
place and be hit by a bus.

01:19:45.065 --> 01:19:48.099
The point I'm trying to make is this,

01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:52.565
until you die, son,

01:19:52.566 --> 01:19:54.234
you live.

01:21:03.845 --> 01:21:05.712
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:21:07.846 --> 01:21:11.946
- So, I was just about to go for a walk.

01:21:11.947 --> 01:21:13.247
You wanna go with me?

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:17.347
- Yeah, sure.

01:21:18.248 --> 01:21:23.249
- Okay, I have a surprise
that I wanna show you.

01:21:24.615 --> 01:21:26.282
- What does that mean?

01:21:26.283 --> 01:21:28.881
- Uh, means we gotta use this again.

01:21:28.882 --> 01:21:29.982
Remember this?

01:21:29.983 --> 01:21:32.315
- Yeah, I remember that.

01:21:32.316 --> 01:21:33.583
- Okay, come on.

01:21:35.251 --> 01:21:36.683
- Oh, my gosh.
- Don't peek.

01:21:36.684 --> 01:21:38.217
- I'm not peeking.

01:21:38.218 --> 01:21:39.185
- Too tight?

01:21:39.186 --> 01:21:40.483
- No, it's fine.

01:21:40.484 --> 01:21:41.884
- You look like a pirate.

01:21:41.885 --> 01:21:43.118
- Arghh.

01:21:43.119 --> 01:21:44.617
- Good, keep going.

01:21:44.618 --> 01:21:45.951
- Where am I going?

01:21:45.952 --> 01:21:48.718
You know how much this makes me nervous.

01:21:48.719 --> 01:21:50.451
You're doing great.

01:21:50.452 --> 01:21:52.819
- Uh, I don't feel great.

01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:56.386
Oh, oh.

01:21:56.387 --> 01:21:58.654
This is scary.

01:22:01.289 --> 01:22:02.855
Where am I going?

01:22:04.521 --> 01:22:05.555
Whoa.

01:22:05.556 --> 01:22:07.454
- Keep going, keep going.

01:22:07.455 --> 01:22:10.989
- Uh, this is terrifying.

01:22:10.990 --> 01:22:13.390
I don't know which way.

01:22:19.292 --> 01:22:22.557
- Oh, my gosh.

01:22:22.558 --> 01:22:25.292
Where are the pork sandwiches?

01:22:25.293 --> 01:22:27.358
You actually got seafood?

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.492
Oh, my gosh.

01:22:36.961 --> 01:22:41.029
- I am so madly in love with you.

01:22:42.762 --> 01:22:44.962
And when I look at you,

01:22:46.862 --> 01:22:49.197
I see a lifetime together.

01:22:50.396 --> 01:22:52.829
I don't know what the future holds,

01:22:52.830 --> 01:22:55.198
but I want it to be with you.

01:22:57.530 --> 01:22:59.898
You're the blessing of my life.

01:23:01.431 --> 01:23:03.498
Michelle Larson,

01:23:05.766 --> 01:23:08.364
will you marry me?

01:23:08.365 --> 01:23:09.898
- Yes.

01:23:09.899 --> 01:23:11.600
Yeah.

01:23:17.001 --> 01:23:18.667
Gosh.

01:23:18.668 --> 01:23:20.767
- Look at that.

01:23:20.768 --> 01:23:22.868
- You're somethin' else.

01:23:24.969 --> 01:23:27.402
You don't even like seafood.

01:23:28.602 --> 01:23:30.636
- But you love it.

01:23:53.107 --> 01:23:56.840
♫ Will I

01:23:56.841 --> 01:24:00.674
♫ with body broken

01:24:00.675 --> 01:24:04.309
♫ hold resolve another the way

01:24:07.276 --> 01:24:11.677
♫ for now I'll stand

01:24:21.312 --> 01:24:24.511
♫ Will it

01:24:24.512 --> 01:24:27.611
♫ make a difference

01:24:27.612 --> 01:24:31.545
♫ if what I do,

01:24:31.546 --> 01:24:34.745
♫ or what I say

01:24:34.746 --> 01:24:38.315
♫ is from my knees

01:24:40.315 --> 01:24:42.982
♫ somewhere

01:24:46.415 --> 01:24:50.282
♫ I wanna be there

01:24:50.283 --> 01:24:53.983

01:24:53.984 --> 01:24:57.416
♫ beside you

01:24:57.417 --> 01:25:00.617
♫ beside you

01:25:00.618 --> 01:25:02.252

♫ by my side

01:25:13.787 --> 01:25:17.087
♫ I wanna be beside

01:25:17.088 --> 01:25:20.987
♫ I wanna be beside you.

01:25:24.289 --> 01:25:26.289
- Do you see that?

01:25:28.555 --> 01:25:30.356
That light?

01:25:32.556 --> 01:25:33.889
- No.

01:25:36.091 --> 01:25:39.023
- What is it, what do you see?

01:25:39.024 --> 01:25:41.125
- It's in the ceiling.

01:25:42.658 --> 01:25:44.391
It's so peaceful.

01:25:46.558 --> 01:25:48.693
It's like the stars.

01:25:51.759 --> 01:25:53.627
- You're scaring me.

01:25:55.294 --> 01:25:57.659
- Don't be scared.

01:26:09.762 --> 01:26:14.030
- Michael, you're not gonna die.

01:26:15.563 --> 01:26:17.931
Wanna know how I know that?

01:26:19.531 --> 01:26:21.697
- How?

01:26:21.698 --> 01:26:24.233
- Because I can't take anything else.

01:26:25.832 --> 01:26:30.132
I need God to show me that He's there.

01:26:30.133 --> 01:26:32.832
I need him to show me
that He cares about us

01:26:32.833 --> 01:26:36.267
and that He loves us.

01:26:36.268 --> 01:26:38.301
- He does.

01:26:40.235 --> 01:26:43.467
Today, I had strength

01:26:43.468 --> 01:26:46.668
that shouldn't have been possible.

01:26:48.736 --> 01:26:52.435
I walked down the aisle today

01:26:52.436 --> 01:26:55.503
and married the girl of my dreams.

01:26:58.238 --> 01:27:03.238
Each and every day with
you is a gift from God.

01:27:03.239 --> 01:27:05.405
Don't be afraid.

01:27:07.606 --> 01:27:10.239
- I'm always afraid.

01:27:55.147 --> 01:27:56.779
- Do you need some water?

01:28:07.515 --> 01:28:08.648
- What's wrong?

01:28:08.649 --> 01:28:11.050
- I can't breathe.

01:28:14.084 --> 01:28:16.449
- Matt?

01:28:16.450 --> 01:28:18.117
Where are your pills?

01:28:18.118 --> 01:28:20.252
This was just filled yesterday.

01:28:21.417 --> 01:28:23.985
- Yes, please, please hurry.

01:28:23.986 --> 01:28:25.352
- I can't breathe.

01:28:25.353 --> 01:28:28.517
- Hey, did you really take all your meds?

01:28:28.518 --> 01:28:30.952
- Yeah.

01:28:30.953 --> 01:28:33.086
- Call 911, call them now.

01:28:33.087 --> 01:28:34.686
- What's your name?
- Michael.

01:28:34.687 --> 01:28:36.519
- Michael, my name's Chris.

01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:38.053
How long has this been going on?

01:28:38.054 --> 01:28:40.120
- It just started not that long ago.

01:28:40.121 --> 01:28:41.787
- Has he ever been like this before?

01:28:41.788 --> 01:28:43.388
- Not like this.

01:28:46.655 --> 01:28:48.521
- What kind of medical
history does Michael have?

01:28:48.522 --> 01:28:50.122
- Um, cancer.

01:28:50.123 --> 01:28:51.322
- What kind of cancer?

01:28:51.323 --> 01:28:52.389
- Leukemia.

01:28:56.057 --> 01:28:57.924
- Let me go.

01:29:00.791 --> 01:29:02.791
- I'm going to hold this up to your face...

01:29:06.993 --> 01:29:08.926
- Just let me die.

01:29:09.826 --> 01:29:10.993
- We're gonna start an IV on you,

01:29:10.994 --> 01:29:12.525
so we can give you medications.

01:29:12.526 --> 01:29:14.492
The ambulance is on it's way.

01:29:14.493 --> 01:29:16.260
Good job, Michael.

01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:26.128
- His heart
could stop at any moment,

01:29:26.129 --> 01:29:28.195
so we're going to need to
keep him here overnight.

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:30.395
Probably the next few days.

01:29:30.396 --> 01:29:31.896
You're fortunate that you found him

01:29:31.897 --> 01:29:34.196
and that the paramedics
got there soon enough.

01:29:34.197 --> 01:29:37.197
Another 30 minutes, it
would have been too late.

01:29:37.198 --> 01:29:40.563
Has he ever tried to
take his own life before?

01:29:40.564 --> 01:29:45.430
- We've had a few scares,
but nothing like this.

01:29:45.431 --> 01:29:46.765
- When he wakes up, I'm gonna order

01:29:46.766 --> 01:29:48.999
a psych eval for him.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.999
Ok, I'll check back with you later.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.099
- Thanks, doc.

01:29:52.100 --> 01:29:53.733
- Hey, I'm gonna go see how Mike's doing.

01:29:53.734 --> 01:29:55.533
- Okay.

01:29:57.101 --> 01:29:59.067
- I just...
- Oh, I know.

01:29:59.068 --> 01:30:00.967
- I just can't take this.

01:30:00.968 --> 01:30:03.734
- I know, honey, I know.

01:30:29.007 --> 01:30:30.606
- Matt's here.

01:30:54.477 --> 01:30:58.409
- Yeah, I've had a lot
of time to think in here

01:30:58.410 --> 01:31:01.278
and I've been blaming

01:31:01.279 --> 01:31:04.478
everyone and everything.

01:31:04.511 --> 01:31:07.045
I blamed God,

01:31:07.046 --> 01:31:10.747
my medication, my doctors,

01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:14.046
and then I realized something,

01:31:14.047 --> 01:31:16.847
even when you were at your sickest,

01:31:16.848 --> 01:31:20.115
you always found a way to smile.

01:31:26.849 --> 01:31:30.116
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, um,

01:31:30.117 --> 01:31:33.683
I guess you could say we've been talking.

01:31:36.450 --> 01:31:41.151
It has been the greatest honor of my life

01:31:41.152 --> 01:31:46.019
growing up with you and being
able to call you my brother.

01:32:29.227 --> 01:32:32.525
- I, Michelle.
- I, Michelle.

01:32:32.526 --> 01:32:35.726
- Take you, Michael.
- Take you, Michael.

01:32:35.727 --> 01:32:39.060
- To be my husband.
- To be my husband.

01:32:39.061 --> 01:32:41.827
- I do promise
in covenant before God.

01:32:41.828 --> 01:32:44.094
- I do promise in covenant before God.

01:32:44.095 --> 01:32:45.794
- And these witnesses.

01:32:45.795 --> 01:32:47.296
- And these witnesses.

01:32:47.297 --> 01:32:49.561
- To be your
loving and faithful wife.

01:32:49.562 --> 01:32:51.695
- To be your loving and faithful wife.

01:32:51.696 --> 01:32:53.596
- In plenty and in want.

01:32:53.597 --> 01:32:55.496
- In plenty and in want.

01:32:55.497 --> 01:32:57.596
- In joy and in sorrow.

01:32:57.597 --> 01:32:59.697
- In joy and in sorrow.

01:32:59.698 --> 01:33:01.597
- In sickness and in health.

01:33:01.598 --> 01:33:03.563
- In sickness and in health.

01:33:03.564 --> 01:33:07.831
- For as long
as we both shall live.

01:33:07.832 --> 01:33:10.799
- For as long as we both shall live.

01:34:11.710 --> 01:34:13.742
- I thought I
had accepted God's plan

01:34:13.743 --> 01:34:16.209
for Michael's life, but really,

01:34:16.210 --> 01:34:18.311
I'd been holding out for healing

01:34:18.312 --> 01:34:21.910
and when it didn't come, I was lost,

01:34:21.911 --> 01:34:24.345
but in my sorrow, I missed
the truly powerful thing

01:34:24.346 --> 01:34:27.012
that had happened right
in front of my eyes.

01:34:29.813 --> 01:34:32.212
In life, Michael was a teacher.

01:34:32.213 --> 01:34:34.080
He taught people how to protect themselves

01:34:34.113 --> 01:34:36.646
and respect others.

01:34:36.647 --> 01:34:37.947
He showed them what it meant to be

01:34:37.948 --> 01:34:41.148
a true and giving friend,
and even where you could get

01:34:41.149 --> 01:34:44.081
the best barbecue ribs.

01:34:44.082 --> 01:34:47.582
He helped a brother see the
light through the darkness.

01:34:50.317 --> 01:34:52.449
But the most important lesson was the one

01:34:52.450 --> 01:34:56.582
he made so clear to us in
his life and death trial,

01:34:56.583 --> 01:34:59.284
the power of real faith.

01:35:13.653 --> 01:35:16.453
- Mr. Fenton, you
were wrong when you said

01:35:16.454 --> 01:35:18.586
God wouldn't answer me that night.

01:35:18.587 --> 01:35:21.087
He did, He sent you.

01:35:21.088 --> 01:35:22.922
Thank you for being a true friend.

01:35:22.956 --> 01:35:24.988
Michael.
