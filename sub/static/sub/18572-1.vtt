01:26.619 --> 01:28.814
Hey, get up.
It's time to check the buoy.

01:30.056 --> 01:31.546
Come on, Josh.

01:34.194 --> 01:37.891
Oh, no.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.258
So you regret
proposing to my sister?

01:43.303 --> 01:46.329
What I regret is letting you
plan my engagement party.

01:46.372 --> 01:48.169
I know.

01:49.175 --> 01:51.837
Here, get this into you.

01:51.878 --> 01:54.039
It's my great-gran's
hangover remedy.

01:58.985 --> 02:00.145
Oh!

02:01.187 --> 02:03.155
Smells like shit.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.622
Oh, God.

02:09.762 --> 02:11.662
You're spilling it.

02:13.366 --> 02:16.961
You know, once you get
past the gag reflex,

02:17.003 --> 02:19.597
- it's actually not that bad.
- Yeah.

02:22.008 --> 02:23.566
Rory...?

02:23.610 --> 02:26.044
I'll check the buoy.

02:26.079 --> 02:28.912
Oh, my sister's down the beach.
She wants to show you something.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.736
Rory: Looks like it's gonna be
a busy one. Want a hand with that?

02:55.775 --> 02:57.572
What, you're actually gonna
get wet today?

02:57.610 --> 02:59.601
Make a bit of a change, wouldn't it?

03:19.165 --> 03:20.496
Hey.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.728
I bet you've never seen one of these.

03:22.769 --> 03:24.100
What is it?

03:25.538 --> 03:26.800
Wow.

03:31.411 --> 03:33.675
Were you looking at my butt?

03:33.713 --> 03:35.203
No.

03:35.248 --> 03:37.239
- No?
- Maybe.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.759
Aww.

03:58.471 --> 03:59.995
You look terrible.

04:00.039 --> 04:02.940
Thanks.
It's your brother's fault.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.509
But you smell nice.

04:12.552 --> 04:14.383
You always smell nice.

04:45.918 --> 04:48.045
Are you ready
to leave all this behind?

04:49.889 --> 04:51.880
Where you go, I go.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.818
Well, there won't be places like this
in Singapore.

04:55.862 --> 04:58.695
Oh, we'll come back.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.120
Lifeguard:
Shit.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.790
Shark! Shark!

05:41.774 --> 05:44.538
Get help!

05:44.577 --> 05:46.238
Go get help!

05:46.279 --> 05:47.746
Rory!

05:49.682 --> 05:52.150
Get everyone out of the water!

05:53.419 --> 05:55.216
Joe, give me a hand.

06:05.131 --> 06:07.326
Rory!

06:11.971 --> 06:13.097
No!

06:14.107 --> 06:17.304
Rory!

06:17.343 --> 06:19.777
- Shark!
- I can't hear you.

06:19.812 --> 06:21.746
- Shark!
- What?

06:29.455 --> 06:31.582
Give me your hand.

06:37.830 --> 06:39.195
Rory!

06:44.404 --> 06:45.996
I got you. I got you.

06:49.275 --> 06:51.106
No.

06:52.145 --> 06:55.581
No!

08:13.993 --> 08:16.120
Along with
the yearly southern migration

08:16.162 --> 08:19.222
of the humpback whales
along the East Coast waters,

08:19.265 --> 08:22.132
"Surfline" surfing spokesman
Jeff Tripp said

08:22.168 --> 08:24.796
people should be very vigilant
this time of year,

08:24.837 --> 08:27.670
as we've seen large gatherings
of sharks in the waters

08:27.707 --> 08:29.607
following the whales
along the coast.

08:29.642 --> 08:31.007
Now, what they're doing

08:31.043 --> 08:32.408
is hunting the whale calves

08:32.445 --> 08:35.278
and bait fish
surrounding the migration.

08:44.991 --> 08:46.982
So if you are heading to the beaches,

08:47.026 --> 08:49.824
please observe the signs
and swim only between the flags.

08:49.862 --> 08:53.320
Great whites are expected
in the area over the next month.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.357
And now, on a brighter note,

08:55.401 --> 08:57.961
it's been a picture-perfect day
here on the East Coast

08:59.138 --> 09:01.038
with blue skies
as far as the eye can see.

09:04.810 --> 09:06.675
No signs improving

09:06.712 --> 09:08.612
for the sailors
and the windsurfers, however.

09:08.648 --> 09:10.775
We seem to be hit
with the doldrums,

09:10.816 --> 09:13.785
which means there are
no surface winds.

10:43.843 --> 10:46.243
We gotta move to the car park.

10:46.278 --> 10:48.678
Can't stay here.

11:12.071 --> 11:13.834
Yes, please.

11:17.576 --> 11:19.237
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:19.278 --> 11:21.337
- Jessup come by yet?
- Not yet. You're safe.

11:21.380 --> 11:23.371
Good morning, by the way.

11:24.550 --> 11:26.313
Yeah.

11:51.310 --> 11:53.403
Why are we stopping here?

11:55.347 --> 11:57.781
- Hey, Kyle.
- Shh.

12:05.124 --> 12:07.456
You're bad.

12:07.493 --> 12:09.586
-Hey.

12:13.499 --> 12:14.659
Shut up.

12:37.356 --> 12:39.517
What are you doing here?

12:45.564 --> 12:48.032
You scared me.

12:52.338 --> 12:53.828
Happy anniversary.

12:53.873 --> 12:55.602
You remembered.

12:55.641 --> 12:58.474
11 months, baby.

12:58.511 --> 13:02.140
It's not very much. It's just a song
playlist for when we go to Sydney.

13:02.181 --> 13:04.649
Thank you. Thank you.

13:04.683 --> 13:07.618
Ooh, and...

13:07.653 --> 13:10.850
happy anniversary
to you too.

13:13.926 --> 13:17.293
- Tell me you didn't steal these.
- Oh, Ryan.

13:17.329 --> 13:19.559
Yeah, okay, okay, put them back.

13:19.598 --> 13:21.930
But then I have nothing to give you.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.594
Doesn't matter.
It's the thought that counts.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.298
Put them back, okay?

13:26.338 --> 13:27.498
Come on.

13:27.540 --> 13:30.168
Oops, I hope we're not
interrupting anything.

13:31.410 --> 13:33.275
You know, that's a really cool jacket.

13:33.312 --> 13:34.609
Thanks.

13:34.647 --> 13:39.084
Bet it's got lots of pockets, huh?
Mind if we take a little peek?

13:44.857 --> 13:46.290
She's gonna pay for it.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.054
Just take it out of my paycheck
if you don't believe me.

13:48.093 --> 13:50.220
Paycheck?

13:50.262 --> 13:52.457
You're living in a dream world, kid.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.022
You're fired.

13:54.066 --> 13:58.127
And you shoplifting,
destruction of property.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.035
I've already called the cops.

14:01.707 --> 14:03.698
Did you see all those birds this morning?

14:03.742 --> 14:06.074
There must have been thousands.

14:06.111 --> 14:09.444
You know, there were crows
and magpies and everything.

14:18.157 --> 14:19.886
When did you get back?

14:26.065 --> 14:28.898
Tina, this is what you want?

14:31.704 --> 14:32.898
Josh, this is

14:32.938 --> 14:35.270
Oh, Jesus.
Josh, look at you.

14:35.307 --> 14:36.774
Go clean yourself up.

14:39.645 --> 14:42.671
No, not the customer bathroom.

15:03.102 --> 15:05.195
I got the call.

15:09.008 --> 15:10.373
Oh, shit.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.740
Whoa! Hello.

15:24.023 --> 15:25.820
You starting to hear something

15:25.858 --> 15:27.849
stirring around that head of yours?

15:31.864 --> 15:34.162
The office is at the back of the store.

15:34.199 --> 15:38.499
Cash pickup's in 10 minutes,
so you've got five to get out.

15:40.506 --> 15:43.873
When this is done,

15:43.909 --> 15:46.275
we're straight.

15:47.313 --> 15:49.178
My brother's clean

15:49.214 --> 15:51.978
and I don't want to ever see
your face around him again.

15:53.085 --> 15:54.746
You understand me?

15:56.155 --> 15:57.952
Whatever you say.

16:26.452 --> 16:28.477
I want her charged this time.

16:34.693 --> 16:36.558
She didn't steal this.

16:38.063 --> 16:39.724
This is hers.

16:44.269 --> 16:46.328
We both know you're not gonna
go through with it.

16:46.372 --> 16:48.932
Just stop, because I'm this close.

16:48.974 --> 16:51.238
To what?
Arresting me?

16:51.276 --> 16:53.210
Yeah, real A-plus parenting, Dad.

16:53.245 --> 16:55.338
- Jaimie, you're too smart to--
- Oh, you just dropped

16:55.381 --> 16:57.611
to a C-minus due to lack of originality.

16:57.649 --> 16:59.344
Okay, okay, what about this?

17:00.386 --> 17:02.377
I'm gonna process you this time.

17:02.421 --> 17:04.252
You can spend the day in lockup.

17:04.289 --> 17:05.881
And what do you think that's gonna do?

17:05.924 --> 17:08.654
Maybe it's the wake-up call you need.

17:14.299 --> 17:16.290
Piss off.

17:17.536 --> 17:20.266
What do you think your mother
would have thought about all of this?

17:20.305 --> 17:22.603
Piss off!

17:56.542 --> 17:59.067
Put that on.
That's it.

18:00.312 --> 18:02.542
- Thanks.
- Great.

18:28.907 --> 18:30.898
What the?

18:34.012 --> 18:35.240
Give me the money.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.475
Shit, man, there's no money in the safe.

18:42.554 --> 18:44.579
Give me the money.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.921
All right, just take it easy, okay?

19:02.774 --> 19:04.639
You see?

19:08.947 --> 19:11.006
Where is it?

19:12.684 --> 19:14.811
Do you want a separate bag for that?

19:54.193 --> 19:56.889
Hey, drop that fucking gun...

19:56.929 --> 19:59.022
-...or I'll do this bitch!

19:59.064 --> 20:00.531
Where's the money?

20:01.533 --> 20:03.660
You I said,
put the guns down!

20:03.702 --> 20:05.932
Put 'em down!

20:21.253 --> 20:22.982
Thank you.

20:24.456 --> 20:26.720
My dad was totally--

20:26.758 --> 20:28.817
Your dad's right, Jaimes.

20:28.860 --> 20:30.088
Not you too.

20:30.128 --> 20:32.619
I lost my job today
because of you.

20:32.664 --> 20:34.962
Who cares?
You hated that job anyway.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.025
I care. I care.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.969
Well, if it's that important
to you,

20:39.004 --> 20:40.801
I'll go get your
stupid job back, then.

20:40.839 --> 20:43.000
- Jaimie, just--
- No. Watch.

20:52.551 --> 20:57.079
Oi! Freak boy
from history class, right?

21:34.226 --> 21:36.490
You, get here.

21:36.528 --> 21:38.393
- Get here.
- No.

21:38.430 --> 21:40.330
You, get over there.
Stay back.

21:40.365 --> 21:41.832
- No.
- Stay back.

21:41.867 --> 21:43.391
Do as you're told.

21:43.435 --> 21:45.528
What the fuck did you do?

21:45.570 --> 21:47.595
Josh.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.300
Get back.

21:49.341 --> 21:51.332
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

21:51.376 --> 21:54.402
Don't be a hero, mate.
Stay back.

21:54.446 --> 21:55.572
Tina.

21:56.581 --> 21:57.843
No!

21:57.883 --> 21:59.578
Stop it.

22:02.354 --> 22:04.345
What was that?

22:08.827 --> 22:10.454
What?

22:10.495 --> 22:12.725
Down! Down!

22:16.101 --> 22:17.898
- Come on.

22:20.072 --> 22:22.768
Oh.

22:57.943 --> 23:00.343
I should know, I built the store.

23:09.755 --> 23:12.087
Hurry up. This way.

23:12.124 --> 23:13.989
Come on, come on!

23:15.727 --> 23:18.389
Go! Run!

24:46.518 --> 24:48.509
Hey!

24:48.553 --> 24:49.986
Over here!

24:52.190 --> 24:54.249
Have you seen anyone?

24:56.495 --> 24:59.396
Anyone else?
Anyone?

25:02.234 --> 25:04.862
I need help.

25:04.903 --> 25:07.269
Anybody?

25:07.305 --> 25:09.136
Help!

25:09.174 --> 25:10.766
- Hey.
- Here.

25:11.776 --> 25:13.767
Where's Tina?

25:14.779 --> 25:16.440
Where's Tina?

25:16.481 --> 25:18.472
Jesus Christ.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.508
Can you help him?
I don't know what to do.

25:20.552 --> 25:21.985
- Just calm down.
- Can you help him?

25:22.020 --> 25:23.920
Calm down.

25:23.955 --> 25:26.822
What the hell's happening?
What just happened?

25:26.858 --> 25:28.587
We gotta get him
out of the water.

25:28.627 --> 25:30.618
Help me lift him
onto this shelf.

25:42.741 --> 25:45.710
I need you to go and find
anything you can to wrap this leg--

25:45.744 --> 25:47.735
towels, electrical tape--
I don't care.

25:47.779 --> 25:49.110
Okay.

25:52.217 --> 25:54.685
Dad? Dad!

25:56.121 --> 25:58.521
My God. Jaimie!

25:58.557 --> 26:00.548
Dad?

26:01.626 --> 26:03.321
- Jaimie.
- Dad!

26:07.365 --> 26:09.356
Here, give me your hand.

26:13.705 --> 26:14.933
Jaimie.

26:14.973 --> 26:16.099
Da--

26:17.142 --> 26:18.905
Dad.

26:23.481 --> 26:24.971
How did you get out?

26:25.016 --> 26:26.745
I was in the car.

26:26.785 --> 26:28.412
I was in the car park, and...

26:28.453 --> 26:31.422
Ryan Ryan--

26:31.456 --> 26:33.651
Oh, my God.

26:33.692 --> 26:36.490
Oh, my God,
Ryan's still in the car park.

26:36.528 --> 26:38.621
- Forget it, kid.
- Ryan's still in the car park.

26:38.663 --> 26:40.528
Forget it.

26:40.565 --> 26:42.829
If it's flooded up here,

26:42.867 --> 26:45.529
they've had it down there.

27:17.535 --> 27:18.832
Tina?

27:20.772 --> 27:22.535
Tina!

27:24.876 --> 27:27.640
Okay, I need your help.

27:27.679 --> 27:30.341
I need you to help
your dad, okay?

27:30.382 --> 27:33.010
Put your hands here
and keep pressure on his leg.

27:33.051 --> 27:35.019
Can you do that for me?

27:35.053 --> 27:36.543
You'll be fine.

27:36.588 --> 27:38.078
Tina.

27:44.629 --> 27:48.258
Tina. Hey.

27:50.168 --> 27:52.159
You're okay.

27:52.203 --> 27:54.262
Look at me.

27:54.305 --> 27:56.296
You're okay.

27:56.341 --> 27:58.605
What what happened?

27:58.643 --> 28:00.304
Where are all the people?

28:00.345 --> 28:02.677
Hey, come on.

28:43.722 --> 28:46.213
Here, give me your hand.

29:32.036 --> 29:35.096
- Help me. Help me.
- Okay, okay.

29:35.140 --> 29:37.506
- Help me.
- Calm down. Calm down.

29:56.895 --> 29:58.886
Help!
We're trapped!

29:58.930 --> 30:01.262
- Someone get us out of here!
- Is anyone there?

30:01.299 --> 30:03.290
- Anyone? Anyone?
- Help!

30:03.334 --> 30:05.734
Somebody help us, please.

30:07.338 --> 30:09.670
Did you hear that?

30:09.707 --> 30:12.335
- Did you hear that?
- Shh. Stop talking.

30:18.383 --> 30:19.975
Where did it go?
Do you hear it?

30:20.018 --> 30:21.747
Not when you don't shut up.

30:21.786 --> 30:24.983
Well, excuse me for helping, Kyle, really.

30:26.257 --> 30:28.316
It's behind you.
It's behind you.

30:28.359 --> 30:30.691
Yeah, you find that noise.
You find it.

30:30.728 --> 30:32.628
Good boy, Bully.
Good boy.

30:47.745 --> 30:48.939
Shit.

30:48.980 --> 30:51.847
Fuck. Fuck.

31:11.736 --> 31:13.260
Fuck.

31:54.412 --> 31:56.403
Can anybody hear me?

31:59.117 --> 32:01.108
Hello?

32:10.795 --> 32:12.729
Is anybody there?

32:13.731 --> 32:15.892
Oh, fuck.

32:20.204 --> 32:21.466
Oh.

32:23.007 --> 32:26.340
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

33:13.591 --> 33:15.252
Are you ready?

33:23.801 --> 33:26.099
We've got to get out of here.

33:26.137 --> 33:28.128
We can't stay here.
We've got to get help.

33:29.140 --> 33:31.199
What--?

33:31.242 --> 33:33.767
Oh, shit.

33:43.121 --> 33:45.521
Don't let him
out of your sight.

33:53.531 --> 33:55.761
The water's still rising.

33:55.800 --> 33:57.290
No, no, it can't be.

33:57.335 --> 33:59.394
The whole bloody town
must be flooded up there.

33:59.437 --> 34:02.201
No, it's not.
Look, they're gonna come for us.

34:02.240 --> 34:04.470
They know we're down here.
They're gonna come for us.

34:04.509 --> 34:06.773
That's assuming there's
someone still up there to come.

34:06.811 --> 34:09.803
- You, this is all your fault.
- Not mine, boy, not today.

34:09.847 --> 34:13.179
Today Mother Nature saw us all
as sinners down here.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.275
Why don't you just shut up?

34:15.319 --> 34:17.514
He can't swim anywhere with this leg.

34:20.425 --> 34:22.016
I'll stay here.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.585
You guys find a way out
and bring a rescue team back.

34:24.629 --> 34:26.426
What? No, Josh, wait.

34:26.464 --> 34:28.431
Well, how do we get out?

34:28.466 --> 34:32.402
With the car park flooded,
that leaves only

34:32.437 --> 34:34.768
the loading bay storeroom
and the front entrance.

34:34.806 --> 34:37.900
Josh, you cannot stay here, okay?
You know as well as I do

34:37.942 --> 34:40.172
this is gonna bring aftershocks with it.
It's gonna bring more--

34:40.210 --> 34:42.577
More waves, I know.

34:42.612 --> 34:44.877
So you'll have to be quick.

34:49.887 --> 34:52.481
Okay, well, Steven and l
will check the front.

35:08.206 --> 35:10.436
I'll take the loading bay.

35:10.475 --> 35:11.874
I don't think so.

35:12.910 --> 35:16.004
- Bob?
- Yep.

35:16.047 --> 35:17.378
You go.

35:19.617 --> 35:20.914
Okay.

35:51.582 --> 35:53.777
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

35:53.818 --> 35:56.116
How could you not have
charged your phone?

35:56.154 --> 35:59.089
I can't do everything, Kyle.
God, why didn't you charge it?

35:59.123 --> 36:01.114
Uh, because it's not my phone.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.650
Oh, well, then where is your phone?
Hello.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.561
Oh, well, that's much better.

36:12.570 --> 36:14.629
- What is it, Bully?

36:14.672 --> 36:16.196
Why are you growling like that?

36:16.240 --> 36:18.105
Because he's a fucking retard.

36:18.142 --> 36:21.407
That is not funny, Kyle.
You're not a retard, Bully.

36:27.552 --> 36:29.884
What the hell was that?

36:29.921 --> 36:32.116
I have no idea.

37:30.848 --> 37:32.577
What's that?

37:37.855 --> 37:39.584
Where did it go?

37:48.899 --> 37:50.560
Get everyone
out of the water.

37:50.601 --> 37:51.829
What?

37:51.869 --> 37:53.928
Get everyone out of the water now!

37:53.971 --> 37:55.370
What's happening?

37:55.406 --> 37:57.966
Tina!
Out of the water now!

37:58.009 --> 37:59.840
- Can't get out that way.
- Hurry!

37:59.877 --> 38:01.572
It's blocked.

38:01.612 --> 38:03.170
Out of the water!

38:03.214 --> 38:04.772
Quick, swim.

38:04.815 --> 38:06.806
What's going on?

38:06.851 --> 38:08.512
Tina, Steven, get out of the water!

38:10.721 --> 38:12.518
Collins?

38:14.025 --> 38:16.289
Tina, hurry!

38:19.864 --> 38:22.264
Where is he?
Where did he go?

38:32.743 --> 38:34.802
- Oh!
- Shit.

38:38.416 --> 38:40.281
Jaimie, get back.

38:45.856 --> 38:48.757
Help me!
Please help me!

38:48.793 --> 38:50.283
Help me!

39:13.818 --> 39:15.615
Shit.

39:17.855 --> 39:21.723
Where did it go?
Did you see it?

39:21.759 --> 39:23.886
What the hell could do that?
What is in here?

39:25.062 --> 39:26.120
There.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.271
Give me your hand.

39:42.947 --> 39:45.745
Ow, my hand.

39:47.518 --> 39:49.679
Jesus Christ.

39:51.021 --> 39:53.683
- That had to be five feet.
- What had to be five feet?

39:53.724 --> 39:56.284
- Six.
- Six? What do you mean, six?

39:56.327 --> 39:59.296
Six feet from the tip
of the dorsal to the tip of the tail.

39:59.330 --> 40:01.389
So what the hell does that mean?

40:02.433 --> 40:04.901
It means there's a 12-foot
great white shark in here.

41:03.227 --> 41:05.218
Fuck!

41:19.043 --> 41:21.477
- I can't see anything.
- Just keep calm, babe.

41:21.512 --> 41:23.639
We have to get out of this car.
I can't stay here much longer.

41:27.451 --> 41:29.715
Give me your shoes.

41:29.753 --> 41:30.913
Excuse me?

41:30.955 --> 41:33.549
Well, I need something with a point
to break the windscreen.

41:33.591 --> 41:35.354
Give me your shoes.

41:35.392 --> 41:37.292
Are you crazy?
These are $300 Gucci.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.228
They're gonna get wet anyway.
Just give me your shoes.

41:39.263 --> 41:40.855
- No.
- Heather, give--

41:40.898 --> 41:43.492
- I'm not giving you my Gucci.

41:46.270 --> 41:48.261
They're not Gucci.

41:48.305 --> 41:52.173
Um, clue you gave them to me
for Christmas last year,

41:52.209 --> 41:54.074
and you said that they were
$300 Guccis.

41:54.111 --> 41:57.046
Um, clue I know I did,
and they're not.

41:59.450 --> 42:00.940
You bought me fake Gucci.

42:00.985 --> 42:02.509
You wouldn't have known
if I didn't just tell you.

42:02.553 --> 42:05.579
I can't believe you.
Fake Gucci?

42:05.623 --> 42:07.750
Just give me your shoes.

42:10.127 --> 42:11.822
What are you doing?

42:25.543 --> 42:28.103
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

42:30.915 --> 42:33.975
Hey! Hey, over here.

42:34.018 --> 42:36.316
Freak boy? Is that you?

42:36.353 --> 42:39.516
Jesus Christ, I never thought
I'd actually be happy to see you.

42:39.557 --> 42:42.390
Yeah, no shit. Did you find
anyone? Is there anyone else?

42:42.426 --> 42:44.519
There's bodies everywhere.
There's no one alive.

42:44.562 --> 42:47.292
Well, did you check
the ramp?

42:47.331 --> 42:49.424
It's all jammed up.
I can't get through.

42:49.466 --> 42:52.264
You got a phone
or something in there?

42:52.303 --> 42:54.464
Uh, no.

42:54.505 --> 42:57.133
Holy shit, Kyle. Kyle!

42:57.174 --> 42:59.165
What? What?

42:59.209 --> 43:01.109
Oh, Jesus Christ.

43:02.279 --> 43:03.940
Oh, shit.

43:15.159 --> 43:17.457
It's okay.

43:17.494 --> 43:20.122
- I think it's gone.

43:20.164 --> 43:21.529
Oh, shit.

43:26.370 --> 43:28.702
Oh, man,
this is not happening.

43:28.739 --> 43:30.707
This is so not happening.

43:30.741 --> 43:32.971
You you're a cop, right?

43:33.010 --> 43:35.410
You gotta do something.

43:35.446 --> 43:37.539
For Christsakes, do something.

43:37.581 --> 43:39.913
Do you have any ideas?

43:39.950 --> 43:42.180
Oh, you think
this is funny, do you?

43:42.219 --> 43:44.949
- More ironic, really.
- Oh, really? Well, please share.

43:44.989 --> 43:48.584
I'm sure we could all do
with a good ironic laugh right now.

43:48.626 --> 43:50.617
Think about it.

43:50.661 --> 43:53.789
You bust your ass in here
eight hours a day, seven days a week.

43:53.831 --> 43:55.492
Right?

43:55.532 --> 43:58.194
You'll probably hump away like that
for the next 40 years.

44:00.604 --> 44:03.937
So whatever way you cut it,
this place was gonna kill you.

44:03.974 --> 44:06.738
Now it's just sooner
rather than later.

44:06.777 --> 44:09.075
You son of a bitch.

44:09.113 --> 44:11.445
I want you to know,

44:11.482 --> 44:15.248
the woman you killed--
her name was Julie

44:15.285 --> 44:17.378
and she was a friend.

44:17.421 --> 44:19.412
- I didn't kill anyone.
- It makes no difference.

44:19.456 --> 44:21.981
She died during your robbery,
so it's your fault, you bastard.

44:22.026 --> 44:24.324
If we get out of here alive, I swear
I'm gonna make you fucking pay.

44:24.361 --> 44:26.488
Enough!

44:29.767 --> 44:31.758
It's coming back.

44:33.537 --> 44:35.732
Why does it keep doing that--
just circling?

44:35.773 --> 44:37.764
Because it's not sure
what we are.

44:37.808 --> 44:39.537
It's curious.

44:39.576 --> 44:41.066
Curious about what?

44:41.111 --> 44:44.410
A shark's only curious
about one thing.

44:44.448 --> 44:47.042
It's trying to decide
if we're food or not.

44:52.890 --> 44:55.256
- What was that?
- Hang on, everybody.

44:55.292 --> 44:57.692
Just hang on.

45:09.773 --> 45:11.400
We have another problem.

45:15.446 --> 45:17.641
Why are you laughing?

45:17.681 --> 45:19.615
'Cause he just realized
when the water hits those cables,

45:19.650 --> 45:21.914
this whole place will light up
like a Christmas tree.

45:21.952 --> 45:24.944
Jessup, where do we shut it down?

45:29.560 --> 45:31.687
The storage room.

45:31.729 --> 45:34.163
All the power mains
are in the storage room.

45:37.367 --> 45:38.857
I'll go.

45:38.902 --> 45:41.234
- What?
- Everyone go to the end of the shelf,

45:41.271 --> 45:43.865
make as much noise as you can.

45:43.907 --> 45:45.397
I'll swim for it.

45:45.442 --> 45:46.875
Josh, no.

45:46.910 --> 45:49.743
I mean, you can't.
Your arm look at your arm.

45:49.780 --> 45:51.941
I mean, the shark will go
straight for you.

45:51.982 --> 45:54.348
You can't, not with that.

45:54.384 --> 45:56.648
I don't think we have
any other options.

46:03.360 --> 46:04.725
Hold on.

46:07.231 --> 46:09.222
I have an idea.

46:16.640 --> 46:18.369
Do you see it anywhere?

46:18.408 --> 46:20.501
Yeah, I see it, but I'm keeping it
a secret from you

46:20.544 --> 46:22.171
because I want you to be surprised.

46:22.212 --> 46:24.407
Oh, well, thank you for your
thoughtfulness, Kyle, really.

46:24.448 --> 46:26.575
It's what I always dreamed of
in a boyfriend.

46:29.753 --> 46:32.449
Oh, I can't handle this much longer.

46:32.489 --> 46:34.389
It may surprise you,
but I am not equipped

46:34.424 --> 46:36.324
to deal with this kind of situation.

46:36.360 --> 46:39.818
Here, Bully,
I need some space.

46:45.235 --> 46:47.601
Kyle, do something.
You have to do something.

46:47.638 --> 46:49.765
Like what?
Ask the fucking thing to go away?

46:50.841 --> 46:52.365
- Oh, shit.

46:52.409 --> 46:55.708
- Help!
- Help us, please! Help us!

46:57.614 --> 46:59.138
Get down. Get down.
Get down.

47:04.588 --> 47:06.715
Help us!
Do something!

47:06.757 --> 47:09.055
- Okay.
- Help us!

47:15.098 --> 47:17.566
All right, just get back in the car.

47:17.601 --> 47:19.694
Just stay as still and quiet as possible.

47:19.736 --> 47:21.966
- What, are you fucking insane?
- Just listen, listen.

47:22.005 --> 47:23.939
Why don't you jump in the water
and do a couple of laps?

47:23.974 --> 47:25.703
All right, just listen to me.
You gotta keep still, okay?

47:25.742 --> 47:27.972
The more you scream,
the more the shark's gonna come.

47:28.011 --> 47:30.707
Hey, hey, just get back in and wait.

47:30.747 --> 47:32.510
I'm gonna get the shark to come to me.

47:32.549 --> 47:33.982
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What?

47:35.586 --> 47:37.577
When I get it over here,
you swim like hell

47:37.621 --> 47:40.055
for my van over there.
You see it?

47:43.327 --> 47:45.318
This is crazy.

47:51.034 --> 47:52.763
Babe, look at me.

47:52.803 --> 47:55.533
Don't move.

47:55.572 --> 47:58.666
Stay here as still as you can.
Can you do that?

48:15.325 --> 48:17.486
You think this will work?

48:17.527 --> 48:19.392
Absolutely.

48:19.429 --> 48:22.990
I wouldn't eat a cheeseburger
with its wrapping on.

48:23.033 --> 48:24.864
But of course...

48:24.902 --> 48:26.893
I'm not a shark.

48:29.640 --> 48:32.040
Here.

48:32.075 --> 48:34.066
Yeah.

48:45.889 --> 48:47.880
Look...

48:49.626 --> 48:51.890
you don't know me...

48:54.231 --> 48:56.995
- but when Tina came to Singapore--
- I don't want to know about it.

48:57.034 --> 48:58.968
Well, you should.

49:02.339 --> 49:04.330
We were never--

49:08.278 --> 49:11.338
The whole time she was there...

49:12.649 --> 49:15.117
she missed you.

49:17.321 --> 49:19.312
It wasn't your fault--

49:19.356 --> 49:21.756
what happened.

49:23.493 --> 49:25.051
That's what she said.

49:26.730 --> 49:29.756
Hey, I found some water.

49:29.800 --> 49:31.893
Good?

49:42.079 --> 49:45.606
You come back, okay?

49:47.684 --> 49:50.414
Just come back.

50:00.063 --> 50:01.223
Ready?

50:03.600 --> 50:05.090
Here you go.

52:31.882 --> 52:33.406
Oh, shit.

53:02.345 --> 53:04.745
Oh, man, he's not gonna make it.

53:26.670 --> 53:28.661
He did it.

53:30.106 --> 53:31.937
- He did it.
- Where is he, Josh?

54:17.654 --> 54:19.645
No!

54:21.858 --> 54:23.519
No.

54:25.295 --> 54:27.729
Fuck it. No!

54:51.621 --> 54:55.022
Hey... are you okay?

54:58.361 --> 55:01.023
Look,

55:01.064 --> 55:03.294
we've got to try to keep it together.

55:03.333 --> 55:05.324
Okay?

55:09.606 --> 55:11.733
I know. I just

55:14.144 --> 55:18.103
When's it gonna end?

55:21.851 --> 55:23.842
And why is this happening?

55:27.424 --> 55:29.392
Why?

55:32.696 --> 55:36.154
When my mom was dying--

55:36.199 --> 55:39.327
she died two years ago--

55:39.369 --> 55:42.497
she was so sick.

55:44.541 --> 55:47.009
I tried.

55:49.512 --> 55:53.039
A couple of months
before she died, I left.

55:53.083 --> 55:55.278
I couldn't take it.

55:55.318 --> 55:57.786
I just took off to America.

55:57.821 --> 56:00.051
And...

56:00.090 --> 56:02.581
I wasn't there

56:02.625 --> 56:04.616
when...

56:09.532 --> 56:13.127
So this is my payback.

56:13.169 --> 56:15.160
Life saying, "Screw you.

56:16.306 --> 56:18.831
How are you gonna
run away from this?"

56:33.990 --> 56:35.981
Here.

56:36.025 --> 56:38.255
There's a secret to it.

56:39.496 --> 56:41.521
You have to do it gently.

56:41.564 --> 56:44.727
Just peel the two
pieces of plastic apart

56:44.768 --> 56:46.759
Iike that.

56:47.904 --> 56:49.804
Thanks.

56:52.475 --> 56:55.569
Was she a friend of yours
the girl that got killed?

56:55.612 --> 56:58.843
Julie?

56:58.882 --> 57:00.873
No, not really.

57:00.917 --> 57:03.977
I mean, I knew her
and everything, but

57:07.490 --> 57:11.449
It was just supposed
to be me, you know?

57:11.494 --> 57:13.485
A quick in and out.
Nobody else, just me.

57:15.298 --> 57:17.698
I guess it's true what they say

57:17.734 --> 57:19.725
"Let the devil take your hand

57:19.769 --> 57:21.703
and God will make you pay."

57:24.941 --> 57:27.375
We're not gonna make it
out of here, are we?

57:27.410 --> 57:30.140
I don't believe that.

57:32.348 --> 57:34.339
No.

57:35.485 --> 57:37.476
We'll make it out of here.

57:39.856 --> 57:41.687
Good.

58:35.378 --> 58:37.676
Oh, shit, it's working.
It's working.

58:37.714 --> 58:39.579
Go now.
Go, go now, now.

58:39.616 --> 58:41.106
Come on, go, go, go.

58:42.118 --> 58:44.052
Fuck! Swim!

58:45.154 --> 58:47.315
- Swim!
- Climb! Just climb!

58:49.926 --> 58:51.917
Sorry, Bully.

58:52.929 --> 58:54.590
- Fuck!

58:54.631 --> 58:56.792
Stay back!

58:58.535 --> 59:01.060
Bully! Bully!

59:06.209 --> 59:07.608
Fuck!

59:17.854 --> 59:20.254
You need to
slide it through...

59:21.291 --> 59:22.417
not fling it.

59:36.973 --> 59:39.567
It's strong, but it can't
take much weight.

59:44.380 --> 59:46.848
Screw this.
I'm out of here.

01:00:00.196 --> 01:00:02.756
If you can get through,
you get help and bring them back.

01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:04.528
Yeah, yeah, all right, all right.

01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:13.039
- Ready?
- Let's go.

01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:27.817
Got it?

01:00:53.616 --> 01:00:56.084
- Pull him up!
- I can make it. I can make it.

01:00:56.119 --> 01:00:58.952
- Pull up now.
- I can make it. I'm okay.

01:01:23.312 --> 01:01:24.609
Give me your hand.

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:49.228
Are you gonna talk to me
or what?

01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:52.070
No.

01:01:52.108 --> 01:01:54.133
- Heather, I didn't.
- Don't.

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:56.839
Don't even try.

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:59.006
Murderer.

01:02:02.985 --> 01:02:04.612
I'm not a murderer.

01:02:04.654 --> 01:02:06.417
Oh, yes, you are.

01:02:06.456 --> 01:02:10.119
You're a dog murderer,
which is worse than a person murderer.

01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:13.218
How could you?

01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:16.356
Heather, I didn't have a choice.

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:19.391
Bullshit.
You always have a choice.

01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:23.234
Murderer.

01:02:26.476 --> 01:02:28.467
Whatever.

01:02:36.018 --> 01:02:37.849
Argh!

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:42.414
Uh!

01:03:03.479 --> 01:03:05.242
Hey. Hey.

01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:07.272
Can that pipe hold my weight?

01:03:07.316 --> 01:03:10.308
I can't get out this way.
I want to get to that door.

01:03:10.353 --> 01:03:12.048
What do you think?

01:03:12.088 --> 01:03:13.953
I don't know.
Give it a go.

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:28.794
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:31.830
Can you see it anywhere?

01:03:31.874 --> 01:03:34.308
I don't know.
You're the one with the bloody torch.

01:03:40.049 --> 01:03:41.846
Shit.

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:50.619
Are you okay?

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.724
Whew.

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:02.797
Ooh, Jesus.

01:04:05.107 --> 01:04:07.268
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:04:12.715 --> 01:04:14.979
Good stuff.
Keep going.

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:16.985
Is he gonna make it?

01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:18.611
Babe, shut up.

01:04:25.828 --> 01:04:27.022
Shit.

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:35.030
You're good. You got,
like, six feet. Keep going.

01:04:46.115 --> 01:04:47.776
Oh, shit.
Hold on.

01:04:47.817 --> 01:04:49.375
Grab on. Grab on.

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:50.908
Shit.

01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:56.849
Swim, swim, swim.
Quick, quick.

01:04:59.328 --> 01:05:00.693
- Quick.
- Got you, buddy.

01:05:02.832 --> 01:05:05.323
Kyle! No!

01:05:05.368 --> 01:05:07.598
- Quick, quick.
- Give me your hand.

01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:14.834
Give me your hand!

01:05:42.171 --> 01:05:44.469
We're not gonna just
sit around and wait for that thing

01:05:44.507 --> 01:05:46.441
to pick us off one by one.

01:05:46.475 --> 01:05:48.409
And what do you think
you're gonna do?

01:05:48.444 --> 01:05:50.435
At the very least, I'm gonna die
on my own terms

01:05:50.479 --> 01:05:52.140
and not when that damn fish
decides it's time.

01:05:52.181 --> 01:05:54.445
So you think what?

01:05:54.483 --> 01:05:56.678
You're gonna catch it?

01:05:59.855 --> 01:06:01.015
Why not?

01:06:03.259 --> 01:06:05.523
What are you gonna do if you catch it?

01:06:05.561 --> 01:06:08.724
Spark up the barbie
and crack open the tartare sauce?

01:06:08.764 --> 01:06:10.493
I'm gonna tie it to this shelf

01:06:10.533 --> 01:06:12.592
and we're gonna swim like hell
to the entrance.

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:14.569
Get the hell out of here.

01:06:14.603 --> 01:06:17.128
All I need isa hook.

01:06:20.209 --> 01:06:22.473
You can't save everybody, mate.

01:06:22.511 --> 01:06:24.672
You must be getting used
to that by now.

01:06:28.017 --> 01:06:30.008
It's not that far.

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:33.284
If we can distract the shark,

01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:34.789
I'll swim it,

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:36.792
get the hooks.

01:06:40.529 --> 01:06:42.520
I'll do it.

01:06:42.565 --> 01:06:45.033
What? Dad, no.

01:06:45.067 --> 01:06:46.830
Oh, you can't, not with your leg.

01:06:46.869 --> 01:06:48.359
My leg is exactly why I should go.

01:06:48.404 --> 01:06:49.928
Dad, no, please.

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:53.205
You keep my daughter safe.

01:06:53.242 --> 01:06:55.472
No matter what happens,
you get her out of here, okay?

01:07:10.192 --> 01:07:11.352
Jaimie!

01:07:13.429 --> 01:07:15.329
Jaimie! Jaimie!

01:07:15.364 --> 01:07:17.958
Naomi, make noise,
get the shark to come toward us.

01:07:20.803 --> 01:07:23.203
Hurry, quick, make some noise!

01:07:42.858 --> 01:07:44.621
Jaimes, are you okay?

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:47.226
Yeah.

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:01.202
Okay, hang on.

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:07.173
Jump!

01:08:22.031 --> 01:08:23.828
Good work, kid.

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:50.782
So what's the deal?

01:08:50.826 --> 01:08:52.953
Do you know her
or just want to?

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:57.933
I used to.

01:08:57.966 --> 01:08:59.627
Used to, huh?

01:08:59.667 --> 01:09:01.658
'Cause I can see by that look in your eye,

01:09:01.703 --> 01:09:04.002
whatever was there, still is.

01:09:06.308 --> 01:09:08.173
That was a long time ago.

01:09:17.051 --> 01:09:20.385
Trust me,
after this shit here,

01:09:20.421 --> 01:09:22.822
everything we knew
is a long time ago.

01:09:43.312 --> 01:09:45.542
You still wear that.

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:53.109
Yeah.

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:03.192
- Tina
- You don't have to.

01:10:03.232 --> 01:10:05.564
- We don't have to do this, Josh.
- No, I do.

01:10:08.904 --> 01:10:11.031
I wasn't fair to you.

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:15.400
I just..

01:10:17.513 --> 01:10:19.947
I always set the buoy.

01:10:23.919 --> 01:10:26.251
Rory did it for me that day.

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:30.549
But I should have been
the one out there.

01:10:30.593 --> 01:10:31.753
Josh.

01:10:31.794 --> 01:10:34.126
And I hated myself.

01:10:36.699 --> 01:10:39.964
But...

01:10:40.002 --> 01:10:43.563
before I knew
what had happened,

01:10:43.606 --> 01:10:46.905
everything just...

01:10:46.942 --> 01:10:49.137
slipped away.

01:10:49.178 --> 01:10:51.646
And I'm sorry.

01:10:56.986 --> 01:10:59.318
I just wanted to say that.

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:07.191
I'm sorry.

01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:15.460
The thing is, Josh...

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:21.031
you never had to say sorry to me.

01:11:24.013 --> 01:11:26.607
All you had to do
was say it to yourself.

01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:32.943
I would have been there.

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:36.724
Hey, you all secure
down there?

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.860
Yeah.

01:12:13.395 --> 01:12:14.885
Why didn't it take it?

01:12:15.898 --> 01:12:19.129
Well, if you ask me,
I think it's pretty obvious.

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:21.295
After the past couple of hours,

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:24.363
it's decided it prefers live bait.

01:12:24.406 --> 01:12:25.839
That's not funny.

01:12:25.874 --> 01:12:27.967
Do I look like I'm joking?

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:30.001
Get down!

01:12:30.045 --> 01:12:31.945
You stay back.
Stay back!

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:34.210
I saved this last bullet for you, Doyle.

01:12:34.249 --> 01:12:36.114
- You son of a bitch.
- You.

01:12:36.151 --> 01:12:37.812
What about the mask on the body?

01:12:39.888 --> 01:12:42.948
Wasn't me, mate.

01:12:42.991 --> 01:12:45.391
Now, how about
we get ourselves a shark?

01:12:45.427 --> 01:12:48.157
It really is a pretty good idea.

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:50.563
We just need better bait.

01:12:50.599 --> 01:12:53.432
And this looks pretty tasty, eh, Doyle?

01:12:53.469 --> 01:12:56.461
Kirby, listen to me.

01:12:56.505 --> 01:12:58.530
You don't want to do this.

01:12:58.574 --> 01:12:59.836
Don't l?

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:01.365
No.

01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:03.901
What you did earlier
doesn't matter right now.

01:13:03.946 --> 01:13:07.473
So you let her go and
we can work something out.

01:13:07.516 --> 01:13:09.108
Shut up, cop.

01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:11.016
Don't bullshit me.

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:14.580
I shot someone.
That's not going away.

01:13:14.623 --> 01:13:16.614
Now, I'm getting out of here

01:13:16.658 --> 01:13:18.523
and I'm catching this fucking shark.

01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:24.292
And whatever happens...
happens.

01:13:24.333 --> 01:13:26.164
- Get in there!

01:13:26.201 --> 01:13:28.692
- Josh, no.
- Anyone thinks about touching her,

01:13:28.737 --> 01:13:30.500
you go in too.

01:13:43.051 --> 01:13:44.245
Naomi, here.

01:13:48.223 --> 01:13:50.350
You're okay. Okay.

01:13:50.392 --> 01:13:52.826
So you want to help?

01:13:52.861 --> 01:13:55.193
You think it needs live bait?

01:13:57.966 --> 01:13:59.763
Well...

01:14:05.874 --> 01:14:07.705
Let's give it what it wants.

01:14:54.923 --> 01:14:56.914
Oh, my God.

01:14:56.959 --> 01:14:59.086
It's worked.

01:14:59.127 --> 01:15:01.118
Now let's get out of here.

01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:11.801
I don't think anyone's coming for us.

01:15:13.675 --> 01:15:15.768
I think if they were,
they'd be here by now.

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:21.214
I don't know.

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:24.413
Maybe they're trying

01:15:24.453 --> 01:15:27.183
and they're just dealing
with the same shit we are.

01:15:35.964 --> 01:15:37.932
- Bully?

01:15:39.768 --> 01:15:40.962
Bully!

01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:43.631
Oh, float over.

01:15:43.672 --> 01:15:45.333
No, don't. No.

01:15:46.608 --> 01:15:47.870
- Come on, Bully.
- Baby, swim.

01:15:50.846 --> 01:15:51.938
Grab him quick.

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:59.252
Yay. Bully.

01:16:03.926 --> 01:16:06.918
It's a sign.
I know it is.

01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:09.123
Yay.

01:16:10.365 --> 01:16:12.799
You're a good boy.

01:16:18.206 --> 01:16:19.764
Get up.

01:16:47.336 --> 01:16:50.362
It's okay, sweetheart.
Come on.

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:02.176
- What are you doing?
- I don't know. Call it a sign.

01:17:09.358 --> 01:17:10.518
What is that?

01:17:10.559 --> 01:17:12.527
It's Ryan.

01:17:13.528 --> 01:17:15.792
Oh, my God, it's Ryan.

01:17:15.831 --> 01:17:17.458
I have to go get him.

01:17:19.835 --> 01:17:22.599
Jaimie, no. Jaimes.

01:17:27.442 --> 01:17:29.967
Go after her, please.

01:17:34.616 --> 01:17:36.743
Josh.

01:18:03.078 --> 01:18:05.069
I'll be back soon.

01:18:26.068 --> 01:18:28.935
He's down there.
I know he is.

01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:31.336
Wait here.

01:18:43.151 --> 01:18:45.619
Is he there?
Did you see anyone?

01:18:50.592 --> 01:18:52.583
All right, give mea hand.

01:18:52.627 --> 01:18:54.618
We have to close this door,

01:18:54.663 --> 01:18:56.654
so that when we open
the one downstairs,

01:18:56.698 --> 01:18:58.495
we don't flood the car park.

01:19:20.989 --> 01:19:23.014
- Jaimie!
- Ryan!

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:25.754
- There's a shark. Get out of the water.
- Quick, quick! Go, go!

01:19:27.329 --> 01:19:28.819
Go, quick!

01:19:32.868 --> 01:19:34.335
Give me your hand!

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:38.262
Come on.

01:19:38.306 --> 01:19:39.705
Josh!

01:19:41.276 --> 01:19:43.506
Come on!

01:19:48.517 --> 01:19:51.680
It's Dad's car.
There's a gun.

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:54.416
- What?
- There's a gun in the back.

01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:57.355
Go to the other side.
Get the shark to come to you.

01:20:04.366 --> 01:20:07.358
Hurry! Come on!

01:20:09.437 --> 01:20:11.428
Hurry, quick!

01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:21.713
Josh, quick! Josh!

01:20:22.951 --> 01:20:26.011
Come on, quick.
Come on.

01:21:16.438 --> 01:21:18.497
No go this side.

01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:36.617
Make sure everyone's
out of the water, okay?

01:22:09.791 --> 01:22:12.760
- Dad.
- Jaimes?

01:22:12.794 --> 01:22:14.694
Jaimie!

01:22:29.511 --> 01:22:31.843
Get everyone behind the ramp
and out of the water.

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:33.404
You know what you're doing?

01:22:35.483 --> 01:22:37.246
I'm gonna hook this up

01:22:37.285 --> 01:22:38.946
and I'm gonna blow us
a way out of here.

01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:50.764
Hold on!

01:23:18.994 --> 01:23:20.359
Is everyone okay?

01:23:20.395 --> 01:23:21.828
Yeah.

01:23:21.863 --> 01:23:23.694
- Tina!
- Josh!

01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:31.101
Shit.
Get out of the water!

01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:44.901
Hit it.

01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:10.461
Josh.

01:26:41.262 --> 01:26:43.526
What are we gonna do now?

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:47.464
Start over.
