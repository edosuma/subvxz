00:01.269 --> 00:03.571
You're facing your fears
with The Exorcist.

00:03.604 --> 00:06.174
-Unclean spirit!
-In the name of God!

00:06.207 --> 00:07.908
Catch all-new episodes Fridays.

00:07.941 --> 00:09.543
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:09.577 --> 00:12.146
The Gifted, Lucifer, and Gotham.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.382
I can make a difference, Alfred.
I know I can.

00:14.415 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.721
-Previously on The Exorcist...
-You let a demon

00:20.754 --> 00:22.990
into your head, Tomas.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.992
Evil leaves a mark. It stains.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.660
Now, every thought
that you have,

00:26.694 --> 00:28.662
every decision that you make
is compromised.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.099
You were right. These visions,
they're not a gift.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.834
They're a curse.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.003
(Marcus's voice):
My little church mouse.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.239
Marcus? What is this?

00:38.272 --> 00:40.874
(demonic voice): Ask her
what happened at the abbey

00:40.908 --> 00:42.710
20 years ago.

00:45.779 --> 00:46.680
(Bennett groans)

00:46.714 --> 00:47.848
(panting)

00:47.881 --> 00:49.283
HARPER:
Andy! (muffled cries)

00:54.222 --> 00:56.056
Nikki, I think
I'm losing my mind.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.359
NICOLE: They're trying
to break us apart.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.893
-(chanting)
-You have to fight this!

00:59.927 --> 01:01.762
(whispers):
But we aren't going to let them.

01:01.795 --> 01:02.863
No, we're not.

01:02.896 --> 01:03.997
(screams)

01:09.103 --> 01:11.004
*

01:20.080 --> 01:21.549
Hey, Grace.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.884
-Did you talk to him?
-How is he?

01:23.917 --> 01:25.553
Where's Russ and Colleen?

01:25.586 --> 01:27.221
Uh, upstairs.

01:27.255 --> 01:28.889
Harper had another nightmare.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.959
Did she say anything?

01:31.992 --> 01:34.995
Not to the Holstroms, but I
think they know something's up.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.166
What about Andy?

01:40.268 --> 01:43.771
Uh, Tomas and Marcus say
these things take some time,

01:43.804 --> 01:45.439
but he is fighting back,

01:45.473 --> 01:49.743
so that's good news,
and that we should keep praying.

01:49.777 --> 01:52.780
Right, 'cause that's been
so helpful.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.982
He needs real help.

01:55.015 --> 01:58.419
How do you know they're not
just making things worse?

01:58.452 --> 01:59.953
They're trying to help us, V.

01:59.987 --> 02:01.922
And we're supposed
to just trust them?

02:01.955 --> 02:04.325
It's been three days.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.827
You can't just
keep us here forever.

02:06.860 --> 02:10.431
I'm taking the four of you
off the island.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.099
First thing tomorrow morning.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.066
What?

02:15.636 --> 02:17.271
You can't do that.

02:17.305 --> 02:21.275
Your safety takes precedence
over everything else, even Andy.

02:21.309 --> 02:22.943
What's gonna happen to us?

02:22.976 --> 02:25.112
We'll find temporary housing,

02:25.145 --> 02:27.181
hopefully together,
but I can't make any promises.

02:27.215 --> 02:28.449
For how long?

02:28.482 --> 02:30.551
Until we get everything
sorted out.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.655
That is such crap.

02:34.688 --> 02:37.358
Andy killed someone,
and we all saw it.

02:37.391 --> 02:38.959
Will you please
keep your voice down?

02:38.992 --> 02:42.730
Do you think the cops are gonna
care that he had a demon in him?

02:43.997 --> 02:45.333
Give him a slap on the wrist,

02:45.366 --> 02:47.000
let him go back
to being a foster parent.

02:47.034 --> 02:51.872
We all move back home,
no big deal.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.174
Does that sound real likely
to anyone else?

02:54.208 --> 02:57.245
No. No, it doesn't.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.750
We're never going back.

03:05.353 --> 03:08.922
(Marcus and Tomas
chanting faintly)

03:11.692 --> 03:14.328
(faint chanting echoes)

03:14.362 --> 03:15.996
Did you hear that?

03:16.029 --> 03:18.432
I didn't hear anything.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.035
Your place is in solitude.

03:22.069 --> 03:24.672
Begone. Your abode is
in the nest of serpents.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.006
MARCUS:
Get down and crawl with them.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.841
Looking a bit ragged
there, Marcus.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.077
The years weigh heavy on you.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.513
Perhaps you'd like
to take a break.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.448
We'll be fine without you,
won't we, Father?

03:37.885 --> 03:39.387
The Lord, our ruler,
comes quickly.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.754
A kindling fire before Him.

03:40.788 --> 03:43.056
After all, we have
so much to discuss.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.526
(ragged panting)

03:45.559 --> 03:47.328
How long before he fails you?

03:48.729 --> 03:50.398
Like the one that came before.

03:53.401 --> 03:55.569
Oh.

03:55.603 --> 03:59.273
You didn't tell him about
your little church mouse.

03:59.307 --> 04:02.209
What is he talking about?

04:02.242 --> 04:04.278
(laughs)

04:04.312 --> 04:06.380
It doesn't matter.

04:06.414 --> 04:09.617
(laughing)

04:09.650 --> 04:10.618
-(sizzles)
-Ah!

04:10.651 --> 04:11.952
(screams)

04:11.985 --> 04:14.555
You might delude man,
but you cannot mock God.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.057
Come back to us, Andy.
You have to fight this.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.292
(normal voice):
I'm sorry.

04:18.326 --> 04:19.927
(demonic voice):
Andy's not here.

04:19.960 --> 04:22.129
-Then it's He who casts you out.
-(water sizzles)

04:22.162 --> 04:25.433
-(demonic growling)
-It is He who repels you.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.601
-It is He who expels you.
-(water sizzles)

04:27.635 --> 04:31.071
BOTH: Who touches the living and
the dead and the world by fire!

04:31.104 --> 04:33.741
Hey.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.175
What's wrong?

04:37.277 --> 04:39.613
I don't know. It's just...

04:42.350 --> 04:44.318
How long have we been here?

04:44.352 --> 04:46.354
You're getting tired of me.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.890
You know that's impossible.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.262
(sighs)

04:55.295 --> 04:59.333
But sooner or later, we are
gonna have to leave this room.

04:59.367 --> 05:01.769
We will.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.303
When the time is right.

05:08.509 --> 05:11.945
(Nicole sighs)

05:11.979 --> 05:15.783
Just leave everything to me.

05:15.816 --> 05:19.086
*

05:57.357 --> 05:58.859
(groans softly)

06:00.928 --> 06:03.664
How long was I out?

06:03.697 --> 06:05.332
A few hundred miles.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.367
How is it?

06:10.270 --> 06:12.339
I'm fine.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.842
Your fever's getting worse.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.745
Means the wound's
most likely infected.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.346
You need a bloody hospital.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.348
We need to find
Marcus and Tomas.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.951
Warning them is
all that matters.

06:26.086 --> 06:29.056
Is that why you agreed
to come with me?

06:29.089 --> 06:30.390
Because of him?

06:30.424 --> 06:32.259
What are you talking about?

06:32.292 --> 06:34.695
The demon inside Maria Walters.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.864
It spoke to you
in Marcus's voice.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.366
You know him.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.901
And?

06:40.934 --> 06:43.236
And you never thought
this was worth mentioning.

06:43.270 --> 06:45.873
(sighs) We worked together.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.741
For a time.

06:47.775 --> 06:50.077
You were friends.

06:50.110 --> 06:53.614
I don't have friends.

06:53.647 --> 06:56.584
You know, you're gonna
hurt my feelings.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.621
-Oh.
-If you were a real friend,

07:00.654 --> 07:03.591
you'd let me take you
to the hospital.

07:05.759 --> 07:06.827
Bennett?

07:07.961 --> 07:09.697
Bennett?

07:11.699 --> 07:13.133
Damn it.

07:16.303 --> 07:19.206
(church bell tolling)

07:30.350 --> 07:33.754
('60s pop music playing
over stereo)

07:33.787 --> 07:34.755
(grunts)

07:34.788 --> 07:36.924
Sleeping on the job I see.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.760
Not very professional.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.763
Yeah, I never claimed
to be a professional, did I?

07:42.796 --> 07:45.432
Ready?

07:45.465 --> 07:46.534
Mm-hmm.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.838
Ow.

07:50.871 --> 07:53.774
It's not my fault
you got hair like a sheepdog.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.976
Should I be trusting you
with scissors?

07:56.009 --> 07:57.444
I know what's under
those wimples.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.912
(chuckles)

08:07.154 --> 08:09.489
There's still time
to change your mind, you know.

08:09.523 --> 08:12.459
Skip your initiation.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.796
Run off, live a normal life.

08:15.829 --> 08:19.466
I could say the same to you.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.302
Yeah, except...

08:22.335 --> 08:24.471
this life chose me.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.641
Not the other way around.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.009
You're lucky.

08:29.042 --> 08:32.512
How do you mean?

08:32.546 --> 08:35.649
Because you don't
have to wonder.

08:35.683 --> 08:38.819
You're a vessel
for the word of God.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.989
His power flows through you.

08:42.022 --> 08:45.158
The rest of us are just
fumbling around in the dark,

08:45.192 --> 08:47.761
hoping it's all real.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.400
How's our guest?

08:53.433 --> 08:55.969
You want to see her again,
don't you?

09:01.408 --> 09:04.511
I'm not allowed.

09:04.544 --> 09:08.215
So... easily scared.

09:08.248 --> 09:11.218
It's...

09:11.251 --> 09:12.953
really, really charming.

09:17.290 --> 09:21.228
I'd never let anything happen
to my little church mouse.

09:27.267 --> 09:28.702
(water stops)

09:28.736 --> 09:31.605
(Marcus exhales, sniffles)

09:31.639 --> 09:35.108
(scoffs) I'd kill for
a decent cup of coffee.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.110
This is just pig swill.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.146
And caffeine, so drink up.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.491
One battle at a time, mate.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.397
We're not going to be able

09:57.430 --> 09:59.466
to keep this hidden
for much longer.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.001
I know.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.739
The demon said
you had another partner.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.808
A little church mouse.

10:07.841 --> 10:10.243
(sighs)

10:10.277 --> 10:13.580
She wasn't a partner.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.950
She was just a friend.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.418
A long time ago.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.021
What happened to her?

10:22.956 --> 10:25.358
Nothing... happened.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.964
I moved on to another case,
she took her vows.

10:30.998 --> 10:34.434
She's probably
a fat, happy little nun

10:34.467 --> 10:36.203
living in Brighton somewhere.

10:36.236 --> 10:39.940
Then why bring it up?

10:39.973 --> 10:41.842
It's a demon, Tomas.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.744
It wants to get
inside your head.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.614
You know so much about me,

10:47.647 --> 10:50.617
but I hardly know anything
about your life.

10:50.650 --> 10:54.287
My life is a series of

10:54.321 --> 10:58.792
rooms, demons, and coffee
that tastes like pond water.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.794
(chuckles)

11:00.828 --> 11:03.797
Not much more than that,
I promise you.

11:03.831 --> 11:06.399
Come on, let's get back to work.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.909
*

11:26.019 --> 11:28.021
CALEB: So, all you really need
to do is just feed him

11:28.055 --> 11:29.990
in the morning and at nighttime,

11:30.023 --> 11:32.559
and he really likes it
if you take him out to fly.

11:32.592 --> 11:34.494
Oh, not a problem.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.997
We'll get along just fine,
won't we, Morty? Huh?

11:37.030 --> 11:38.932
(clicks tongue, laughs)

11:43.871 --> 11:46.006
Ah, don't you guys worry
too much.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.708
I had a bout of pneumonia
a couple years ago;

11:48.742 --> 11:52.012
knocked me on my ass,
but I survived.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.781
Andy will, too.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.551
Yeah. Thanks, Russ.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.387
RUSS: You'll be home
before you know it.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.291
(door opens)

12:05.725 --> 12:07.861
How's it going?

12:07.895 --> 12:10.097
Super awesome.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.365
(sighs)

12:12.399 --> 12:14.734
Is this for school?

12:14.768 --> 12:17.370
Andy gave me that,
when I came to live with him.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.705
Hmm.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.540
He knew I was into, like...

12:20.573 --> 12:22.109
building stuff.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.743
It's stupid.

12:23.777 --> 12:24.912
Why is that stupid?

12:24.945 --> 12:26.079
Because, what, like,

12:26.113 --> 12:28.281
I'm gonna go to college?

12:28.315 --> 12:30.083
Become an engineer?

12:30.117 --> 12:32.285
Why not? You're clever.

12:32.319 --> 12:35.122
I'm not gonna have a roof
over my head in six months.

12:35.155 --> 12:36.623
Let alone money for college.

12:36.656 --> 12:38.758
Andy won't let that happen.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.460
Yeah, and what if Andy's dead?

12:40.493 --> 12:41.728
Honey.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.097
It's just pneumonia.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.901
Right.
(chuckles)

12:47.935 --> 12:49.837
Pneumonia.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.969
Your friend went
into septic shock,

13:22.002 --> 13:24.337
so we had to intubate him.
Can I ask what happened?

13:24.371 --> 13:26.940
-He broke a window. -And instead
of going to the hospital,

13:26.974 --> 13:28.976
-he decided to duct tape
his stomach shut? -Mm.

13:29.009 --> 13:30.143
He doesn't like doctors.

13:30.177 --> 13:33.013
How soon before we can wake him?

13:33.046 --> 13:35.348
He's stabilized, but we're not
out of the woods yet.

13:35.382 --> 13:36.950
We're gonna
have to keep him sedated

13:36.984 --> 13:38.785
and under observation
for the next few days.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.153
We don't have time for that.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.389
This isn't a discussion.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.792
This is what's happening.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.962
I should tell you that in cases
that suggest assault,

13:48.996 --> 13:51.498
we're obligated
to inform the police.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.807
(church bell tolling)

14:00.840 --> 14:02.575
(chuckles softly)

14:16.023 --> 14:17.925
(lock clicking)

14:29.569 --> 14:31.504
Hello, Miriam.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.841
There she is.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.576
Again.

14:36.609 --> 14:39.712
But where's her chaperone?

14:39.746 --> 14:43.350
And what would he say,

14:43.383 --> 14:47.854
if Father Marcus knew how often
you come to visit?

14:47.887 --> 14:49.689
Alone.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.492
Sneaky, sneaky girl.

14:56.063 --> 14:58.565
I adjure you, profligate dragon,

14:58.598 --> 15:01.935
in the name
of the spotless Lamb,

15:01.969 --> 15:06.073
who has trodden down the asp
and the basilisk,

15:06.106 --> 15:09.442
and overcome
the lion and the dragon...

15:09.476 --> 15:10.510
(demonic voice):
I am the dragon.

15:12.579 --> 15:13.613
What are you?

15:13.646 --> 15:15.882
Nothing.

15:15.915 --> 15:19.786
Tremble and flee, as we call
on the name of the Lord,

15:19.819 --> 15:22.922
Holy Lord, God of Sabaoth.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.391
Nothing special.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.093
Nothing at all.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.428
But with so much to prove.

15:28.461 --> 15:32.465
The Word made flesh
commands you...

15:32.499 --> 15:35.302
You'll never know
what it means to be chosen.

15:35.335 --> 15:36.869
To see what he sees.

15:38.271 --> 15:41.608
The Virgin's Son commands you.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.743
Jesus of Nazareth
commands you...

15:43.776 --> 15:48.748
12 years old, and he sees
the face of the Almighty.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.917
How is that fair?

15:50.950 --> 15:53.320
I could show it to you,

15:53.353 --> 15:56.289
if you're strong enough
to bear it.

15:56.323 --> 15:59.759
That's why you're here,
isn't it?

15:59.792 --> 16:01.928
To feel what he feels.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.663
I adjure you in His name...

16:03.696 --> 16:05.832
Or perhaps he's right about you.

16:05.865 --> 16:07.300
You're weak.

16:07.334 --> 16:08.501
Harmless.

16:08.535 --> 16:11.138
Nothing.

16:11.171 --> 16:13.106
I adjure you in His name...

16:13.140 --> 16:16.776
You want to fumble in the dark
for the rest of your life,

16:16.809 --> 16:20.780
or do you want to see
the true face of God?

16:20.813 --> 16:23.283
I adjure you in His name...

16:23.316 --> 16:26.053
-(growls)
-(screams, gasps)

16:27.354 --> 16:28.855
(screams)

16:28.888 --> 16:30.823
(screaming continues)

16:38.031 --> 16:39.632
ROSE: I thought you said
you could help.

16:39.666 --> 16:42.302
A normal exorcism
can take weeks.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.471
Sometimes months.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.673
We just... we don't have
that kind of time.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.808
What exactly are you asking?

16:48.841 --> 16:50.677
We can't save Andy
if we can't reach him.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.212
Right now,
he can't tell the difference

16:52.245 --> 16:54.647
between fantasy and reality.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.849
We need him to remember
who he's fighting for.

16:56.883 --> 16:58.985
-ROSE: No.
-We're running out of options.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.720
ROSE: You think I'm gonna
put the children

17:00.753 --> 17:02.322
in the same room as him
after what they saw?

17:02.355 --> 17:03.556
Not all of them, no.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.024
Maybe just one of them.

17:05.058 --> 17:07.327
You think that's
what Andy would want?

17:07.360 --> 17:10.230
Using one of his children
as bait?

17:10.263 --> 17:12.999
We are losing him, Rose.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.301
VERITY:
I'll do it.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.337
Verity...

17:17.370 --> 17:20.340
I'm not gonna spend
the rest of my life wondering

17:20.373 --> 17:21.874
if there was something
I could've done

17:21.908 --> 17:23.443
to help him fight this thing.

17:26.946 --> 17:28.915
I'm not asking for permission.

17:28.948 --> 17:30.750
From either of you.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.719
I'm doing this.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.833
(squishing)

18:12.259 --> 18:14.161
(praying in Spanish)

18:18.631 --> 18:20.533
(ghostly whisper)

18:30.177 --> 18:31.444
(thunder rumbling)

18:36.549 --> 18:38.485
(panting)

19:03.543 --> 19:05.478
*

19:13.486 --> 19:15.322
-Hey.
-Morning.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.357
Going to Andy's.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.125
I heard he had, uh, pneumonia.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.793
The kids are staying
at the neighbors.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.296
That's right, yeah.

19:23.330 --> 19:27.133
Must be one hell of an infection
to call in a couple of priests.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.068
Ex-priest.

19:31.204 --> 19:32.972
You want a ride?

19:33.005 --> 19:35.975
(thunder rumbling)

19:36.008 --> 19:38.578
-(church bell tolling)
-MARCUS: Have no power over her.

19:40.713 --> 19:43.516
(echoing): Lord, send her aid
from your holy place.

19:43.550 --> 19:47.086
Lord, heed my prayer.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.491
Marcus...

19:51.524 --> 19:53.159
(crying)

19:53.192 --> 19:55.194
Hey.

19:55.228 --> 19:57.230
Hey, there you are.

19:57.264 --> 19:59.499
My little church mouse.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.434
MOUSE:
I'm sorry.

20:03.069 --> 20:06.539
I'm so sorry.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.241
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

20:08.275 --> 20:10.176
(gasps)

20:10.209 --> 20:11.544
(shouts)

20:11.578 --> 20:14.180
Please.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.416
Just... let me...

20:16.449 --> 20:19.185
It's my fault,
just let it take me.

20:19.218 --> 20:22.221
Now you're being insulting.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.357
I-I've never lost a single soul,

20:24.391 --> 20:26.293
I ain't about to start
with you, am I?

20:27.727 --> 20:28.995
Hey.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.565
Hey.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.701
There's this, um...

20:34.734 --> 20:39.205
this knees-up little country pub
near Warwick.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.207
Ah, there's a podgy lad
who plays the guitar.

20:41.240 --> 20:45.478
I swear, it feels like
he's strumming your rib cage.

20:45.512 --> 20:46.946
(chuckles)

20:46.979 --> 20:48.881
Let's skive off
for a couple of weeks.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.984
Soak ourselves
inside out with cider.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.222
You thought you were getting
away with something,

20:56.255 --> 20:58.658
didn't you?

21:00.092 --> 21:02.395
(demonic voice):
Never broke your vows.

21:02.429 --> 21:05.598
Not technically.

21:05.632 --> 21:09.436
How were you gonna end it
anyway, huh?

21:09.469 --> 21:12.605
Were you gonna run away
with her,

21:12.639 --> 21:15.375
Casanova?

21:20.112 --> 21:22.349
(rumbling, creaking)

21:25.518 --> 21:28.254
(thunder crashes)

21:28.287 --> 21:31.924
We'll dance
until they kick us out.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.761
A-And when they kick us out,

21:34.794 --> 21:37.497
we'll-we'll dance in the alley
till the sun comes up.

21:37.530 --> 21:40.433
I owe you thanks, priest.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.802
(laughs)

21:42.835 --> 21:46.005
Made her ripe for the picking.

21:46.038 --> 21:50.009
And when you get tired, Mouse,

21:50.042 --> 21:52.111
I'll put you on my back,

21:52.144 --> 21:53.813
and I'll dance us
all the way home.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.815
God is jealous.

21:55.848 --> 21:58.117
-And greedy.
-Mouse.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.052
But I'm not.

22:02.655 --> 22:07.594
Just let her love you,
Father Marcus.

22:09.529 --> 22:12.164
My gift to you.

22:12.198 --> 22:14.200
Oh, what have I done?

22:14.233 --> 22:16.536
-Mouse...
-(laughs)

22:16.569 --> 22:18.738
MARCUS:
Please forgive me.

22:27.514 --> 22:30.316
(Marcus sighs)

22:30.349 --> 22:33.753
So, um, what's really going on
in there, Marcus?

22:38.124 --> 22:39.659
Is there anything I can do?

22:39.692 --> 22:42.995
Just trust me when I say

22:43.029 --> 22:44.597
that we're doing
everything we can.

22:46.265 --> 22:49.636
I do. Trust you.

22:53.205 --> 22:57.677
But when this is all over,
whatever it is you're doing,

22:57.710 --> 22:59.512
you and I are gonna open up
a bottle of bourbon

22:59.546 --> 23:01.614
and have a long, long talk.

23:03.716 --> 23:06.686
You think I'm sticking around
after this, then?

23:06.719 --> 23:10.890
You don't have to stick around.
We could get in the truck,

23:10.923 --> 23:14.126
go for a drive,
see where we land.

23:16.796 --> 23:19.866
Sounds so...

23:19.899 --> 23:21.868
normal.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.704
You say that like
that's a bad thing.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.739
What about my work?

23:28.775 --> 23:30.643
Retire?

23:40.987 --> 23:44.256
Thank you, Peter.

23:49.462 --> 23:51.531
For everything.

24:26.332 --> 24:27.567
(door closes)

24:37.877 --> 24:39.445
You're not up for this.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.514
I'm fine.

24:41.548 --> 24:43.650
MARCUS:
Remember,

24:43.683 --> 24:46.385
anything it says to you,
it's the demon talking.

24:46.418 --> 24:47.620
It's not your dad.

24:47.654 --> 24:49.455
Yeah, okay.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.291
MARCUS: The important thing is
to keep your guard up.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.360
The demon'll look
into your heart,

24:54.393 --> 24:56.395
use whatever it can find
against you.

24:59.198 --> 25:01.734
Let the damn thing try.

25:10.743 --> 25:12.912
(praying in Spanish)

25:17.249 --> 25:19.451
-Hello, Verity.
-Hi.

25:25.057 --> 25:26.759
Don't get too close.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.598
Hey, Andy.

25:33.733 --> 25:35.868
They said I could see you.

25:35.902 --> 25:39.105
Can you hear me?

25:42.274 --> 25:44.443
No, I don't think you should.

25:48.715 --> 25:51.684
I have some things

25:51.718 --> 25:54.020
that I need to tell you...

25:54.053 --> 25:55.521
if you're in there.

25:55.554 --> 25:58.357
And I think you are.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.527
You took me in...

26:01.560 --> 26:03.730
you and Nikki,

26:03.763 --> 26:06.866
when no one else would,

26:06.899 --> 26:11.437
because you believed in me.

26:11.470 --> 26:15.241
(laughing)

26:21.848 --> 26:23.582
"Believed in you..."

26:23.616 --> 26:25.551
(laughing)

26:25.584 --> 26:28.254
Poor Verity still
doesn't understand.

26:28.287 --> 26:30.189
We took you in for the paycheck.

26:31.590 --> 26:34.226
That's not true.

26:34.260 --> 26:38.564
When they find your body,
frozen in some alley,

26:38.597 --> 26:41.400
needle marks in your arms,
they'll say,

26:41.433 --> 26:43.469
"She never had a chance."

26:43.502 --> 26:47.573
'Cause that's what happens to
little girls that nobody wants.

26:47.606 --> 26:50.777
Trash becomes trash.

26:50.810 --> 26:51.911
ROSE:
Okay.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.746
-That's enough.
-Give her a chance.

26:53.780 --> 26:56.448
-I'm not going to stand here...
-I can do this.

26:58.785 --> 27:01.453
ANDY (Nicole's voice):
Verity?

27:01.487 --> 27:03.956
It's me, Nikki.

27:07.660 --> 27:10.129
(softly):
Mom.

27:10.162 --> 27:14.801
Do you want to know
what went through my head

27:14.834 --> 27:17.503
as I stepped into the water?

27:17.536 --> 27:20.472
I thought,

27:20.506 --> 27:25.244
"At least I'll never have to see
that gutter rat Verity again."

27:30.216 --> 27:32.651
That is not your mother.

27:32.685 --> 27:35.654
That is a demon.

27:35.688 --> 27:39.158
Hold on to what is true,
and reject the lies.

27:39.191 --> 27:40.526
ANDY:
You...

27:40.559 --> 27:44.997
were such... a disappointment.

27:46.999 --> 27:50.236
You must reject the demon.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.656
You're right, Andy.

28:10.689 --> 28:14.827
I was a disappointment.

28:14.861 --> 28:18.664
I was snotty and rude

28:18.697 --> 28:21.033
and selfish.

28:21.067 --> 28:26.238
I thought if I could just
push you hard enough,

28:26.272 --> 28:31.744
you'd drop the whole stupid
foster parent act

28:31.778 --> 28:34.914
and just admit that
you hated me.

28:34.947 --> 28:37.016
The same as everyone else.

28:37.049 --> 28:40.186
But you didn't.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.188
No matter what I did,

28:42.221 --> 28:45.357
you always loved me

28:45.391 --> 28:49.261
and believed in me

28:49.295 --> 28:52.198
and fought for me.

28:52.231 --> 28:55.467
You were a really good dad.

28:57.904 --> 29:00.572
And I don't want to say
good-bye to you.

29:03.409 --> 29:07.546
So, you got to fight, okay?

29:07.579 --> 29:09.715
(Verity sniffles)

29:09.748 --> 29:12.184
You need to come back to us.

29:28.300 --> 29:29.802
(gasps):
Verity.

29:29.836 --> 29:32.638
-Dad?
-Listen to me.

29:32.671 --> 29:34.073
I love you.

29:34.106 --> 29:36.108
I love you so much,
but you need to go...

29:36.142 --> 29:37.176
(cries out)

29:38.610 --> 29:40.913
Won't let you hurt her.

29:40.947 --> 29:43.582
(Andy groaning, growling)

29:43.615 --> 29:45.484
(straining):
I won't let you hurt her.

29:45.517 --> 29:46.752
Leave!

29:46.785 --> 29:49.421
Go! Rose, get her out of here!

29:49.455 --> 29:52.091
Get her out of here!

29:52.124 --> 29:53.492
(grunting, crying)

29:53.525 --> 29:55.828
"Put on the full armor of God
so that you can take your stand

29:55.862 --> 29:57.163
against the Devil's schemes."

29:57.196 --> 29:59.665
Kyrie eleison, God, our Lord,
King of ages...

29:59.698 --> 30:01.267
TOMAS: All-powerful
and All-mighty...

30:01.300 --> 30:02.634
MARCUS: Where there is envy
and malice...

30:02.668 --> 30:03.870
TOMAS:
Give us abundance...

30:03.903 --> 30:05.637
(Andy screams)

30:11.978 --> 30:14.580
-Hey.
-(sniffles)

30:19.251 --> 30:20.987
You were incredible.

30:33.265 --> 30:34.867
(thunder crashes)

30:40.506 --> 30:42.641
*

30:42.674 --> 30:45.777
Father, she's awake.

30:51.383 --> 30:53.752
There's no sign
of contamination.

30:55.721 --> 30:57.689
FATHER ROBERT:
Let her go.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.929
Welcome back, my child.

31:04.530 --> 31:05.664
MOUSE:
Who...

31:05.697 --> 31:06.933
My name is Father Robert.

31:06.966 --> 31:08.134
Do you know where you are?

31:10.536 --> 31:14.106
You understand what happened
to your soul and your body?

31:16.208 --> 31:18.310
All because of your curiosity.

31:20.146 --> 31:21.847
(gasps softly)

31:21.880 --> 31:23.515
Where's Marcus?

31:23.549 --> 31:26.785
Father Marcus was unable
to complete the exorcism.

31:26.818 --> 31:28.787
He left three weeks ago.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.858
No...

31:32.891 --> 31:35.794
You're lucky I stepped in when
I did-- you were nearly lost.

31:35.827 --> 31:39.031
No. He... he wouldn't leave me.

31:39.065 --> 31:40.532
God willing,

31:40.566 --> 31:42.568
young Father Marcus will learn
from this day,

31:42.601 --> 31:43.802
as will you.

31:45.737 --> 31:47.940
And the next time
you feel the urge

31:47.974 --> 31:50.542
to go poking around
where you don't belong,

31:50.576 --> 31:53.779
remember your place.

31:53.812 --> 31:56.482
You're God's bride, my child.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.832
*

32:32.651 --> 32:34.553
(thunder rumbles)

32:35.954 --> 32:37.489
All right, I'm gonna go
get the tickets.

32:37.523 --> 32:40.126
You guys wait in the car.

32:42.128 --> 32:43.062
(door bells jingle)

32:46.298 --> 32:48.200
(squishing)

32:57.976 --> 33:00.412
(squishing continues)

33:15.394 --> 33:16.962
You all right?

33:16.995 --> 33:19.331
Yeah.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.470
When was the last time
you slept?

33:24.503 --> 33:27.339
(exhales)
I don't know.

33:27.373 --> 33:28.974
It's been a couple of days,
hasn't it?

33:29.007 --> 33:30.676
Yeah.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.478
Do you want me to take over?

33:32.511 --> 33:34.246
What, and let you have
all the fun?

33:36.348 --> 33:38.650
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.519
Looks like we just
missed this one,

33:40.552 --> 33:42.154
so it's gonna be
a bit of a wait.

33:42.188 --> 33:43.355
You guys want any snacks?

33:46.958 --> 33:48.694
Where's Verity?

33:48.727 --> 33:51.263
We're not supposed to say.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.500
Guys, where's Verity?

33:54.533 --> 33:58.704
Sh-She forgot some book
over at Russ and Colleen's.

33:58.737 --> 34:01.673
I told her it was stupid,
but, you know...

34:01.707 --> 34:03.175
All right, Shelby.

34:03.209 --> 34:04.276
You're in charge.

34:07.979 --> 34:09.448
Tattletale.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.020
Get in the car.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.688
Leave me alone.

34:16.722 --> 34:18.924
I'll get you another copy
of that damn book.

34:18.957 --> 34:21.026
Andy gave it to me.
You can't replace it.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.894
Then I'll send it to you.

34:22.928 --> 34:25.531
No, you can't.
I threw it in the trash.

34:25.564 --> 34:26.698
Verity, I...

34:26.732 --> 34:28.200
we don't have time for this.

34:28.234 --> 34:31.370
No. You don't get
to say no to this.

34:31.403 --> 34:36.542
I am walking away from
everything, my whole life.

34:36.575 --> 34:41.413
And that book is
the one thing...

34:41.447 --> 34:44.583
it's the one thing
that I have from him.

34:46.318 --> 34:49.221
And I'm not leaving without it.

34:49.255 --> 34:51.590
Get in the car.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.492
I'll drive you.

35:03.502 --> 35:07.473
"When the wicked, my enemies
and my oppressors come near me

35:07.506 --> 35:09.775
"to devour my flesh,
they stumble

35:09.808 --> 35:10.942
and fall..."

35:10.976 --> 35:12.244
Poor Peter.

35:12.278 --> 35:15.514
Could have been
so normal together.

35:18.550 --> 35:20.419
MARCUS:
"When the wicked,

35:20.452 --> 35:24.089
"my enemies and my oppressors
come near me to devour my flesh,

35:24.122 --> 35:25.491
they stumble and fall..."

35:25.524 --> 35:28.093
It's not your enemies
that devour your flesh.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.596
It's the people you love

35:30.629 --> 35:32.831
and that's why you leave them.

35:32.864 --> 35:36.668
"When the wicked..."

35:36.702 --> 35:38.337
(Mouse's voice):
Marcus...

35:38.370 --> 35:41.673
Don't. It's my fault.

35:41.707 --> 35:43.442
Let it take me.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.977
(Andy laughs)

35:46.011 --> 35:48.847
(normal voice):
I heard your little mouse

35:48.880 --> 35:50.416
was delicious.

35:52.518 --> 35:54.986
Marcus. Marcus.

35:55.020 --> 35:56.788
-(laughing)
-Marcus. Marcus!

35:56.822 --> 35:59.124
-Marcus!
-I'm fine! I'm fine!

35:59.157 --> 36:00.459
You're not fine.

36:00.492 --> 36:02.694
You're not fine.

36:02.728 --> 36:04.563
And that thing is using it
against you.

36:06.698 --> 36:08.734
You're going to make a mistake.

36:11.069 --> 36:14.139
You need to rest.

36:14.172 --> 36:17.509
Let's take it in turns.

36:17.543 --> 36:20.145
-We'll work in shifts.
-Fine.

36:20.178 --> 36:23.181
As long as I go first.

36:23.215 --> 36:25.083
Okay.

36:44.703 --> 36:47.038
*

36:53.712 --> 36:56.382
(groans softly)

36:56.415 --> 36:59.385
(ghostly whispers)

36:59.418 --> 37:01.186
TOMAS (whispering):
"...not fear.

37:01.219 --> 37:05.190
"Though war break out
against me, I will be confident.

37:05.223 --> 37:08.694
We cast you out,
every unclean spirit."

37:08.727 --> 37:11.062
(Tomas continues praying
indistinctly)

37:18.470 --> 37:20.071
(praying in Spanish)

37:24.510 --> 37:26.412
You look better.

37:26.445 --> 37:28.213
I feel better.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.981
How's our man doing?

37:32.083 --> 37:35.321
The demon is losing its hold.

37:35.354 --> 37:37.122
Andy's gonna beat it.

37:37.155 --> 37:41.126
I wanted to thank you
for before,

37:41.159 --> 37:43.895
making me stand down.

37:43.929 --> 37:47.065
I'm so used to looking out
for you,

37:47.098 --> 37:49.134
feels a bit funny
the other way around.

37:49.167 --> 37:50.836
(chuckles)

37:54.105 --> 37:57.075
You're not an apprentice
anymore, Tomas.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.844
You're an exorcist.

38:02.113 --> 38:06.318
And I'm proud to stand
beside you...

38:06.352 --> 38:07.686
brother.

38:10.689 --> 38:12.624
I...

38:14.793 --> 38:18.564
I didn't know how much
I needed to hear that.

38:21.299 --> 38:22.734
Shall we?

38:26.638 --> 38:27.973
Holy Mary...

38:28.006 --> 38:29.975
Pray for us.

38:30.008 --> 38:31.276
Holy Mother of God...

38:31.309 --> 38:33.011

-Saint Raphael...

38:46.324 --> 38:48.293
Is it my turn?

38:48.326 --> 38:51.997
Uh... yeah, just...

38:52.030 --> 38:53.465
HARPER:
What's happening?

38:53.499 --> 38:55.200
CALEB:
What is it?

38:55.233 --> 38:57.002
HARPER:
Shelby...

38:57.035 --> 38:59.304
-Shelby, I'm scared.
-SHELBY: It's just the lights.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.740
-CALEB: What is it?
-SHELBY: It's just the lights.

39:18.356 --> 39:19.758
Russ?

39:21.760 --> 39:23.261
Colleen?

39:25.363 --> 39:27.866
Hey, sorry, I forgot something.

39:27.899 --> 39:30.268
(thunder rumbles)

39:33.204 --> 39:36.007
(switch clicks)

39:36.041 --> 39:37.943
Anybody home?

39:46.117 --> 39:48.053

40:10.408 --> 40:12.744
(faint clanging)

40:16.915 --> 40:18.049

40:18.083 --> 40:19.485
Hello?

40:28.426 --> 40:30.762
Hello?

Rose?

42:40.058 --> 42:42.460
Rose, is that you?

42:48.600 --> 42:50.301
Colleen.

43:04.582 --> 43:05.851

43:11.623 --> 43:14.092

They're dead. Dead.

43:14.125 --> 43:15.927
Run.

43:17.796 --> 43:19.030
Rose?

43:29.274 --> 43:30.876
Hey, kiddo.

Now that you're good and scared
by The Exorcist,

44:16.054 --> 44:18.389
here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.
