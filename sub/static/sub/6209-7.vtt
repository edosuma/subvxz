WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.300
Sabrina. What took you so long?

00:05.600 --> 00:07.200
I had to fight a family for this booth.

00:07.400 --> 00:09.500
I stood by my locker for 20 minutes
waiting for Harvey,

00:09.800 --> 00:12.900
but then he decided to go hang out
with the guys at that stupid garage.

00:13.300 --> 00:14.300
Let's face it.

00:14.500 --> 00:16.900
We've been ditched
for loud things that go fast.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.900
What do guys talk about
when we're not around?

00:19.100 --> 00:21.200
- Girls?
- Guts.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.000
Guts are way grosser than pus.

00:23.200 --> 00:24.300
Oh, no way, dude.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.100
What's gonna make you yak
in a movie,

00:26.400 --> 00:30.000
a few measly guts
or a geyser of pus?

00:30.400 --> 00:32.600
All right, but generally speaking,
guts include pus.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.100
Oh, yeah.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:51.400 --> 00:53.700
To be or not to bee.

01:03.700 --> 01:06.900
Hey, guys. The Slicery was dead,
so we thought we'd hang here.

01:07.300 --> 01:08.800
Free country.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.300
So how's the car coming along?

01:10.400 --> 01:13.600
We're just having trouble
getting it to, you know, start.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.900
Are you using the right key?
Because that's messed me up before.

01:18.100 --> 01:20.000
My aunt Zelda just got
her alternator replaced.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.400
- Maybe it's the alternator.
- No.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.900
Well, it sure looks rad.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.500
Yeah, you don't see too many
low riders in Westbridge.

01:27.800 --> 01:29.200
What does it do exactly?

01:29.500 --> 01:31.400
Rides real low.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.700
Fascinating.

01:34.400 --> 01:36.100
Well, see you.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.200
Let's never do that again.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.600
Salem, what do boys talk about
when the girls aren't around?

01:45.900 --> 01:48.400
- Boys or boy cats?
- Is there a difference?

01:48.600 --> 01:51.400
Not really. Cats might be
a tad more political.

01:52.100 --> 01:53.700
Sabrina, when the womenfolk
aren't around,

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
men can relax and open up
about the big stuff.

01:57.300 --> 01:59.200
- Tell me what the big stuff is.
- Sorry, honey,

01:59.500 --> 02:01.800
but in the words of the immortal bard,
that's for me to know

02:02.100 --> 02:03.800
and for you to stay up nights
boohooing

02:04.100 --> 02:05.600
because you'll never find out.

02:05.900 --> 02:07.100
- Men.
- Women.

02:07.300 --> 02:08.300
Cats.

02:12.100 --> 02:14.500
I got it. I got it.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.600
Hello? Yes, it is.

02:21.400 --> 02:22.900
No.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.400
Why didn't you get it?

02:25.700 --> 02:27.100
I'm a lazy bum.

02:27.400 --> 02:30.200
- It was Sabrina's vice principal.
- Is Sabrina in trouble?

02:30.500 --> 02:33.300
No. He wants to see me again.
I can't believe it.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.600
Last time we went out,
I pepper-sprayed him.

02:35.900 --> 02:37.300
And next time,
why don't you try this:

02:37.600 --> 02:38.900
"I wanna go home now"?

02:39.800 --> 02:40.900
You got a sec?

02:41.000 --> 02:43.600
- Just one. I've got a lecture to get to.
- I'll make this quick.

02:43.800 --> 02:44.900
What's the mystery of men?

02:45.700 --> 02:49.100
Let me get my calendar
and see if I can clear the next decade.

02:49.500 --> 02:51.000
To truly learn how men think

02:51.200 --> 02:52.400
you have to be accepted by men.

02:52.700 --> 02:54.500
- Which can't be done.
- Unless...

02:54.800 --> 02:56.800
You could try
a turn-yourself-into-a-boy spell.

02:57.100 --> 03:00.000
- You're kidding. We can do that?
- No, absolutely not.

03:00.200 --> 03:02.600
The last time she tried a boy spell,
she got lost for 50 years

03:02.900 --> 03:05.100
because she refused
to ask for directions.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.000
Sabrina, I'm against it.

03:07.300 --> 03:10.200
No boy spells. Got it?

03:14.600 --> 03:16.500
Snips.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.600
Snails.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.300
Some puppy dog tails.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.100
Synthetic.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.100
Add a drop of those.

03:25.300 --> 03:27.400
Ear of newt? There's a new one.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.100
- "Boy Brew."
- Drink it.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.900
Now, if I drink this will I have
boy thoughts or my own thoughts?

03:36.200 --> 03:37.900
Well, you mostly have
your own thoughts.

03:38.100 --> 03:39.700
You just look like
how you would have been

03:39.900 --> 03:41.300
if one of your chromosomes
lost a leg.

03:41.600 --> 03:42.600
Okay. Here goes.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.000
I'm so sorry.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.100
Don't be.
Just means that it's working.

03:51.300 --> 03:53.200
Really? I don't feel any...

03:53.500 --> 03:54.700
Oh, boy.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.600
- Different.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.900
Do I wanna look in a mirror
or is this too weird?

04:01.200 --> 04:03.200
Are you kidding? It's fabulous.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.800
- Dude.
- Do you feel different?

04:08.100 --> 04:11.300
Yes and no.
I mean, I still feel like me,

04:11.600 --> 04:14.100
but for some reason I also sense
that <i>SportsCenter</i> is on.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.500
Now, Sabrina, this is very important.

04:16.700 --> 04:20.100
- Each Boy Brew only lasts two hours.
- Gotcha.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.700
Hey, cool chronograph.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.800
Hey, I know what a chronograph is.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.100
Cool.

04:28.700 --> 04:30.500
It's just me.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.100
Forgot my notes.

04:33.700 --> 04:35.300
Bye.

04:35.500 --> 04:36.900
Do I smell sweat socks?

04:37.200 --> 04:38.500
No. I bought cheese.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.400
Bye.

04:47.100 --> 04:48.800
Salem, my man.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.000
Adolescence is
not sitting well with you.

04:52.300 --> 04:54.700
I'm gonna walk among you guys,
see what makes you tick.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.400
Freeze! Don't squirt that perfume

04:57.600 --> 05:00.100
unless you want to be a boy
who gets beaten up.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.800
Man, that was close.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.600
It's not enough to look like a dude.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.600
You have to start thinking
like a dude.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.200
- You picked a name yet?
- Kirby?

05:08.800 --> 05:10.600
We're back to
getting beaten up here.

05:26.300 --> 05:28.500
- Hey, Valerie.
- Hey.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.100
Do I know you?

05:30.400 --> 05:33.100
Oh, right. The name's...

05:33.400 --> 05:34.800
Jack.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.700
We sat next to each other one time

05:36.800 --> 05:41.800
when homerooms were combined
for an assembly on the Boer War.

05:42.400 --> 05:43.600
I don't remember you.

05:43.700 --> 05:45.100
I don't even remember
that assembly.

05:45.400 --> 05:46.800
Well, it was nice to see you again.

05:46.900 --> 05:49.100
I hear some dudes
are customizing some wheels.

05:49.300 --> 05:51.200
- Don't wanna be late.
- Right.

05:54.300 --> 05:57.700
Hey, did anyone say anything
about that war being on a test?

06:01.400 --> 06:04.200
Sweet ride. You guys need a hand?

06:04.500 --> 06:05.700
Who's asking?

06:05.900 --> 06:08.300
The name's Jack.
I just transferred to Westbridge.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.100
Hey, Harvey Kinkle.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.900
This is Dolrimple, Ramage
and over there is Baines.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.800
Jack what?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.300
Jack Spratsky.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.700
Well, just don't stand there.
Give Kinkle a hand.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.400
I think he got his wrench stuck
in his purse strap.

06:30.700 --> 06:32.700
Hey, any of you clowns
check the alternator?

06:33.000 --> 06:34.700
Good idea.

06:37.400 --> 06:41.600
So I told him that I felt the answer lies
in magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.300
You'll never guess what he said.

06:43.600 --> 06:44.900
I got it.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.500
It's him.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.600
- Thought you turned him down.
- I did.

06:53.900 --> 06:55.500
He must be one of those
resilient losers.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.900
I'll be your best friend
if you tell him I'm not home.

06:58.100 --> 06:59.700
I'd love to help you in your life.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.800
If only you had feigned
some interest in mine.

07:05.700 --> 07:07.800
Okay, Mr. Never-Say-Die.

07:08.100 --> 07:10.600
This calls for drastic measures.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Women.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.400
Yeah?

07:34.600 --> 07:36.700
I'm here to see Hilda.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.900
- Says who?
- Says me.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.600
I mean, l... I say. Who are you?

07:42.500 --> 07:43.700
Name's Sonny.

07:43.900 --> 07:47.900
I ride with the Marbleheads
out of Marblehead.

07:48.300 --> 07:50.000
And you ain't seeing Hilda.

07:50.700 --> 07:52.200
- Excuse me.
- What?

07:52.500 --> 07:54.800
You mind terribly if I ask why?

07:55.100 --> 07:56.800
Because she's my old lady,
poindexter.

07:57.100 --> 08:00.000
Now, if I were you,
I'd make like a tailpipe and blow.

08:00.300 --> 08:02.700
I am terribly sorry.
Misunderstanding.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.600
And... And may I say also

08:04.900 --> 08:09.400
that you people just did a swell job
at Altamont.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.200
Keep walking, four-eyes.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.400
Keep walking.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.700
You guys check out
Troy Aikman last night?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.300
He is so hot.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.400
What's that supposed to mean?

08:22.900 --> 08:26.200
Three hundred and twelve yards,
four TD's and no l-N-T's.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.900
Yeah, what did you think I meant,
his butt?

08:29.900 --> 08:31.400
His butt.

08:33.799 --> 08:34.900
Harvey, you sick?

08:39.700 --> 08:41.700
No one is coming close to that.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.700
There was greatness there
and yet...

08:46.500 --> 08:47.800
Hey, Spratsky, are you in?

08:48.000 --> 08:49.700
Yeah, let's see what you got.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.300
You're ready for the X Games.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.300
We gotta hang out.
How about tonight?

09:02.600 --> 09:04.200
Can't.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Pushups.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.300
D?

09:07.500 --> 09:10.700
My dad's making me learn
how to take inventory.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.200
Kinkle, what's your story?

09:12.500 --> 09:14.400
I might be doing something
with Valerie.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.000
Can you believe it?
Harvey wants to date Valerie.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.700
Well, I thought you and Harvey
did agree to see other people.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.800
Sure. Nitpick.

09:30.900 --> 09:32.800
You're positive
he's gonna ask her out?

09:33.100 --> 09:34.800
Salem, he told me to Jack's face.

09:35.100 --> 09:36.200
What am I gonna do?

09:36.500 --> 09:37.600
Plan A: Mope.

09:37.700 --> 09:40.000
Plan B: Pick up the phone
and beat him to the punch.

09:40.300 --> 09:41.900
I recommend the preemptive strike.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.700
It's how I took Yugoslavia.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.900
I'm not asking a girl out on a date.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.200
Not you. Jack.

09:49.300 --> 09:51.600
It's so unfair. Why does the guy
always have to call?

09:51.800 --> 09:53.700
This is one time
when being a cat is better.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.300
Being in heat
eliminates the guesswork.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.700
Valerie, what's up?

09:59.900 --> 10:01.800
- Who's this?
- Jack Spratsky.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.200
Spratsky?

10:04.200 --> 10:05.700
Remember, we met in the hall?

10:05.900 --> 10:07.000
The Boer War?

10:07.200 --> 10:09.300
Oh, yeah. Hey, do you think
I could borrow your notes?

10:09.600 --> 10:11.400
I didn't take any.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.200
I was too busy looking at you.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.400
- Really?
- Smooth.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.400
You wanna go to the Slicery
with me tonight?

10:17.600 --> 10:19.100
Yeah, I'd love to.

10:19.400 --> 10:22.300
Okay, 7:00. Be there. Ciao.

10:23.300 --> 10:25.700
- She said yes.
- And you said, "Ciao."

10:26.000 --> 10:27.200
I know.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.200
I have a date with a girl.

10:32.600 --> 10:33.800
- Hello?
- Sabrina?

10:33.900 --> 10:36.500
You'll never guess
who just asked me out.

10:37.100 --> 10:39.000
Go with the grain of your fur.

10:39.300 --> 10:40.500
L... I mean beard.

10:43.700 --> 10:45.500
Dare I say it, Sabrina?

10:45.700 --> 10:47.200
You look fly.

10:47.700 --> 10:49.500
Salem, when was the last time
you had a date?

10:51.500 --> 10:54.300
Mama, hearts will be broken.

10:54.700 --> 10:56.500
Can't believe how comfortable I am.

10:56.700 --> 10:58.200
I'm never wearing a bra again.

11:00.500 --> 11:01.800
I can't believe you asked me out.

11:02.100 --> 11:04.000
I mean, I haven't had a date
in practically a year.

11:04.300 --> 11:06.100
I mean, I never get asked out.
Never.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.600
<i>Listen to yourself.</i>
<i>This is not what a guy wants to hear.</i>

11:08.900 --> 11:10.200
And second dates? Forget it.

11:10.400 --> 11:11.900
You'd think I had
an unlisted number.

11:12.200 --> 11:13.200
I don't.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.200
It's the same number you called
for this date.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.200
So I was just wondering,
you know,

11:17.500 --> 11:19.900
if anybody else asked you out
for this weekend.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.400
You're not a very good listener,
are you?

11:23.300 --> 11:25.600
<i>So he didn't ask her out, yet.</i>

11:25.900 --> 11:26.900
Hey, Val.

11:27.500 --> 11:29.000
- Dude.
- Dude.

11:29.300 --> 11:31.400
I didn't expect to see
you two out together.

11:31.700 --> 11:33.100
<i>Maybe I can scare him off for good.</i>

11:33.200 --> 11:37.000
- Excuse us a sec.
- Sure. The place mat has games.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.200
Kinkle, I hope you don't mind me
asking Valerie out.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.700
- No. It's cool.
- Good, because, you know,

11:43.000 --> 11:44.700
Val and I are kind of going out now.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.600
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

11:46.900 --> 11:48.000
But don't tell Val that.

11:48.300 --> 11:51.200
I mean, you know how they are
when they get comfortable.

11:51.500 --> 11:52.500
Right.

11:52.700 --> 11:54.000
Well, I'll check you two later.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.800
You the man, Kinkle.

12:00.500 --> 12:03.100
Are we going Dutch?
Because I only brought $5.

12:09.700 --> 12:11.100
I thought I got rid of you.

12:11.400 --> 12:16.200
Yes, well, this may be what we
in the civilised world call bad form,

12:16.500 --> 12:18.400
but I have to follow my heart.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.700
Well, did you have to follow it here?

12:21.400 --> 12:24.200
Look, I did not see a ring
on Hilda's finger.

12:24.400 --> 12:28.000
Therefore, I must conclude
that it is open season.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.500
What if I told you
we're common law in Montana?

12:31.600 --> 12:33.700
She can do better than some slob
in a pair of chaps

12:33.900 --> 12:35.700
that haven't fit since Watergate.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.200
Hey, aren't you supposed to be home
watching some musical on PBS?

12:39.600 --> 12:41.600
And shouldn't you be using
your unemployment cheque

12:41.900 --> 12:42.900
to buy raisin jack?

12:43.800 --> 12:47.800
I am not going anywhere
until you find Hilda and let her decide.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.100
Don't waste your time.
She's not worth it.

12:50.300 --> 12:51.900
Hey, that's enough.

12:52.200 --> 12:55.400
When Hilda isn't spending my money
she's yapping all the time.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.200
You take that back.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.800
- Make me, haircut.
- I will.

13:01.100 --> 13:03.200
Hey, that was my mother's.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.500
You're going down!

13:07.400 --> 13:09.300
This is better than pay-per-view.

13:09.500 --> 13:13.400
What does she see
in a slow-witted endomorph like you?

13:13.700 --> 13:16.000
There is more to love
than book learning.

13:16.300 --> 13:18.200
Well, I rue the day we met.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.500
What is going on? Time out.

13:20.700 --> 13:21.900
Break it up.

13:22.100 --> 13:23.300
Time out.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.700
Who are you?
And what are you doing in my house?

13:26.300 --> 13:28.100
Oh, dear Lord, it's you.

13:28.700 --> 13:31.400
- He started it.
- Did not.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.500
Look, you want me
to call the police?

13:34.800 --> 13:39.100
Because I have a very good feeling
about some outstanding warrants.

13:39.400 --> 13:40.900
That won't be necessary.

13:41.100 --> 13:43.700
All right. In that case, I will go.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.200
Please give my regards to Hilda.

13:46.400 --> 13:49.300
And next time I'm pulling
your ponytail, suzy.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.900
Did you have to stop it, Zelda?

13:55.200 --> 13:57.500
I had 10 bucks on biker boy.

13:57.700 --> 14:01.800
Why is it every time you're a boy,
you have to start a fight?

14:03.000 --> 14:04.100
So how did your big date go?

14:04.300 --> 14:05.800
Great. We totally hit it off.

14:06.100 --> 14:07.700
I think he really likes me.

14:07.900 --> 14:10.700
That's great, because, you know,
I know a lot of times on first dates

14:11.000 --> 14:13.700
I make the mistake
of talking too much

14:13.900 --> 14:17.000
or acting really desperate
or putting myself down.

14:17.300 --> 14:18.700
You shouldn't do that.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.900
Okay, I'll try better next time.

14:22.100 --> 14:23.500
Refill?

14:26.800 --> 14:28.000
Hey, Val.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.200
You wanna go to the Slicery
with me tonight?

14:30.500 --> 14:32.300
- I'd love to.
- Cool.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.300
- Pick you up at seven?
- Cool.

14:38.100 --> 14:41.000
Hey, do you mind if I go to the Slicery
with Harvey tonight?

14:41.400 --> 14:43.200
- He asked you out?
- Oh, no.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.900
I should have asked you first.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.400
No, it's okay.

14:46.700 --> 14:49.200
Harvey and I are seeing
other people.

14:49.400 --> 14:52.000
It's just I thought
you were dating Jack.

14:52.300 --> 14:54.500
Well, I can juggle two guys.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.100
Two guys.

14:57.300 --> 14:59.500
This new deodorant rocks.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.600
I don't know what feels worse,

15:02.200 --> 15:04.600
Valerie dating Harvey
or Valerie dumping Jack.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.500
I guess I'm just not ready
to see Harvey date other people.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.600
Can I give you some advice,
man to man?

15:10.800 --> 15:12.600
- I'll try anything.
- Go to the Slicery

15:12.700 --> 15:14.100
and mark your territory.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.400
Well, that may be the cat talking,
but it works either way.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.300
This must be your lucky night.

15:40.600 --> 15:41.600
How do you figure?

15:41.800 --> 15:43.100
Senior I'm dating got grounded,

15:43.400 --> 15:46.400
so you get the privilege
of escorting me into the Slicery.

15:46.600 --> 15:47.900
Just chew with your mouth closed

15:48.200 --> 15:50.400
and don't let my Diet Coke
go empty.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.100
I can handle that.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.600
Little did you know
you'd be on a date with me.

15:54.900 --> 15:56.800
Little did you know.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.200
You short guys should wear a sign.

16:08.900 --> 16:10.400
Come on, I wanna play Alley Fight

16:10.600 --> 16:12.700
before the eighth graders
get the buttons all sticky.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.400
Here's a quarter.
Get yourself something pretty.

16:15.700 --> 16:17.000
Very funny.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.500
I mean, I never get asked out.
Never.

16:35.800 --> 16:38.100
There was one time
when a guy who works for my dad...

16:38.500 --> 16:41.100
I wish you would learn
that it's never a good idea

16:41.400 --> 16:43.200
to turn yourself into a boy.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.200
Oh, there was no harm done.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.300
Except for those
four cheese steaks I ate.

16:49.100 --> 16:52.600
Why don't I get rid of Mr. Kraft
before we're featured on <i>Cops?</i>

16:52.900 --> 16:55.100
Nope. That's okay.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.000
I'm kind of starting to like him.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.400
Well, he fought
to defend my honour.

17:02.200 --> 17:03.400
Hello, Hilda.

17:03.700 --> 17:05.900
Come on in, slugger.

17:06.200 --> 17:09.599
Sorry I missed you before,
but here I am.

17:09.900 --> 17:13.099
Yep. But I'm actually here
to see Sonny.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.900
L... I just want to apologise
for the donnybrook

17:17.200 --> 17:20.400
- and maybe buy him a beer.
- I'll go with you.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.400
Oh, boy, that would still be
my first choice.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.900
But, no.
L... I have to clear the air with Sonny.

17:28.099 --> 17:30.700
Otherwise I won't feel right or safe.

17:31.700 --> 17:34.100
So if he's not here,
I guess I'll just be going.

17:34.300 --> 17:35.500
Oh, he's here.

17:36.500 --> 17:37.800
Yes, he's in the dining room.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.000
I just fixed him a plate of turkey.

17:40.300 --> 17:43.300
- Zelda.
- Hilda, there's no harm.

17:44.500 --> 17:47.100
Then I guess I'll get him.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.500
- How have you been?
- I've been very good.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.000
Sonny, that's disgusting.

17:55.300 --> 17:58.500
Well, you won't be hearing it
much longer.

17:59.500 --> 18:02.100
Hey, man.
What it is and what it ought to be.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.500
Absolutely. Brewski?

18:05.800 --> 18:06.900
We'll take my hog.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.800
So I guess we're back to never.

18:12.400 --> 18:15.300
I don't know what you're talking about.
I can't hear the ocean.

18:15.500 --> 18:16.600
Keep trying. It's amazing.

18:16.900 --> 18:20.700
Yeah, never's a really long time
to go without a date.

18:21.500 --> 18:24.300
Listen, there's something kind of
personal I need to talk to you about.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.200
What is it?

18:27.800 --> 18:30.200
Forget it. Mine's broken.

18:33.300 --> 18:36.300
Here. Try the hot sauce.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.400
Get a grip.

18:50.700 --> 18:52.600
Big boys don't cry.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.000
Oh, hey.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.900
Hey, Kinkle.

18:57.300 --> 18:58.500
Jack, are you crying?

18:58.700 --> 19:00.700
No. I just got a wicked whiff

19:00.900 --> 19:03.800
- of some of that pine disinfectant.
- Drag.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.200
So how's your date going?

19:06.800 --> 19:08.200
Oh, it's not a date.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.800
- Can you keep a secret, Sprat-man?
- Sure.

19:13.100 --> 19:15.400
I just wanted to talk
to Valerie about Sabrina.

19:15.700 --> 19:18.400
- You did?
- Yeah. She and I used to go out.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.700
We're still tight, but lately...

19:20.900 --> 19:22.300
I don't know.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.200
Sometimes I just miss her.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.200
Maybe you should tell Sabrina.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.000
No. I mean,
we decided to slow things down

19:29.300 --> 19:31.200
and if I told her,
she might feel pressured.

19:31.400 --> 19:32.600
I don't wanna do that.

19:33.800 --> 19:34.900
Harvey, you're the coolest.

19:36.500 --> 19:39.800
- It is kind of piney in here, isn't it?
- Yeah.

19:40.100 --> 19:41.300
Little word of warning, Jack.

19:42.600 --> 19:43.800
Your mascara's running.

19:45.900 --> 19:47.600
Oh, no. Girl stuff.

19:47.800 --> 19:50.000
Now, personally,
I don't have a problem with it,

19:50.300 --> 19:51.600
but the guys will be all over you.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.200
Thanks, brother.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.000
Gotta go.

19:55.300 --> 19:56.700
Nice chronograph.

20:06.700 --> 20:08.900
My right side
really shouldn't be in here.

20:11.100 --> 20:12.600
Please wear off. Please wear off.

20:12.700 --> 20:14.000
Please wear off.

20:20.100 --> 20:21.400
I'm glad to be back.

20:21.700 --> 20:23.000
I'd better hurry.

20:24.300 --> 20:27.300
- Hey, Libby, looking for someone?
- Jack's been in the bathroom forever.

20:27.700 --> 20:28.800
You'd think he was a girl.

20:28.900 --> 20:31.800
Sorry, Libby, but I saw Jack
leave about 10 minutes ago.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.300
Sprat split?

20:34.600 --> 20:36.200
I listened to pepper for him.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.400
Doesn't he know who I am?

20:40.200 --> 20:42.300
Hey, Sabrina. Over here.
Come have a seat.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.700
- Hey, Val. Hey, Harvey.
- Hey.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.300
You know what? I almost forgot.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.300
I have to bring some scungilli
home for my dad.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.400
Will you two excuse me?

20:52.700 --> 20:54.500
- What's scungilli?
- I don't know.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.800
- You wanna try some?
- Yeah.

20:57.100 --> 21:01.300
Sabrina, you're the only girl I know
with the guts to try gross food.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.000
You know what's really gross?

21:03.300 --> 21:04.400
Pus.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.800
So was it worth it?

21:11.000 --> 21:14.100
Yep. I learned that the mystery
of men is there is no mystery.

21:14.400 --> 21:17.300
If you wonder what they're thinking,
it's whatever they're eating.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.300
- Any more pork rinds?
- I ate them all.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.400
When is this male-pattern
behaviour gonna stop?

21:21.700 --> 21:24.100
Soon. By tomorrow,
you'll be a total priss.

21:24.600 --> 21:27.200
- Oh, come on, you have to catch that.
- He quit on the ball.

21:27.500 --> 21:28.700
He heard footsteps.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.200
If you can't take a hit,
if you don't wanna pay the price,

21:31.500 --> 21:33.000
then go play soccer.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.200
- Am I right, ladies?
- Dude.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.800
Just call me Buzz.
