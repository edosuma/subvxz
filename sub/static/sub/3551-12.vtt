WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.103
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.103 --> 00:05.676
THE RIOT LEFT VICTIMS
IN ITS WAKE.

00:05.676 --> 00:08.039
DO I NEED A TRANSPLANT?
 YOU NEED TO COME TO TERMS

00:08.039 --> 00:11.582
WITH THE REALITY
OF WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU.
 WE'D LIKE TO KNOW
WHERE EXACTLY YOU WERE

00:11.582 --> 00:15.416
WHEN YOUR HUSBAND WAS SHOT.
 MY WIFE IS THE ONE PERSON
ON THAT BACKSTABBING STREET

00:15.416 --> 00:17.448
THAT I CAN TRUST.
 SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,

00:17.448 --> 00:19.720
JUST PRETEND
GRACE DOESN'T EXIST?
 YES!

00:19.720 --> 00:22.353
GABY'S BIOLOGICAL DAUGHTER
WAS ERASED,

00:22.353 --> 00:25.096
AND SHE STRUGGLED TO COPE.

00:25.096 --> 00:27.298
(voice breaks)
I SLEPT WITH TOM.

00:27.298 --> 00:29.300
AND LYNETTE LEARNED THE TRUTH.

00:31.432 --> 00:37.608
(Mary Alice) TOM SCAVO
HAD A 20-YEAR-OLD SECRET.

00:37.608 --> 00:42.113
HE HAD ONCE SLEPT
WITH HIS WIFE'S BEST FRIEND.

00:43.644 --> 00:46.477
TOM FELT IT NO LONGER MATTERED.

00:46.477 --> 00:50.181
BUT HIS WIFE, WHO HAD JUST
LEARNED THIS SECRET...

00:50.181 --> 00:52.353
(click)
 FELT DIFFERENTLY.

00:54.155 --> 00:59.090
THAT'S WHY SHE HAD DECIDED
TO PUNISH HIM...

01:00.331 --> 01:01.492
(spits)

01:01.492 --> 01:02.833
AND TORTURE HIM...

01:08.068 --> 01:10.841
AND HUMILIATE HIM.

01:13.174 --> 01:16.477
LYNETTE PLANNED
TO TELL HER HUSBAND SHE KNEW.

01:16.477 --> 01:20.781
BUT FIRST,
SHE WAS DETERMINED...

01:20.781 --> 01:22.383
TO HAVE HER REVENGE.

01:22.383 --> 01:25.085
WHAT ARE MY KEYS
DOING ON THE FLOOR?

01:30.391 --> 01:32.763
DID MY PANTS JUST... RIP?

01:32.763 --> 01:36.096
YEAH. YOU MIGHT WANNA
GO UP AND CHANGE.
 WOW. (chuckles)

01:36.096 --> 01:39.230
THANK GOD I WASN'T
GOING COMMANDO. (chuckles)

01:39.230 --> 01:42.533
I'M SORRY
YOU HAD TO SEE THAT.

01:42.533 --> 01:43.874
(gasps)

01:43.874 --> 01:45.876
IS THAT A SEAM RIPPER?

01:45.876 --> 01:49.480
COULD BE.
I DON'T REALLY SEW.

01:49.480 --> 01:53.314
DID YOU DO SOMETHING
TO TOM'S PANTS?

01:55.246 --> 01:57.388
LYNETTE.

01:57.388 --> 01:59.390
IT'S JUST A THING I DO

01:59.390 --> 02:02.293
WHENEVER I FIND OUT HE SLEPT
WITH ONE OF MY FRIENDS.

02:02.293 --> 02:06.257
UGH! I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE
TOLD YOU ABOUT US.
 (singsongy) BUT YOU DID.

02:06.257 --> 02:08.598
SO THIS IS HOW
YOU'RE GETTING BACK AT HIM?

02:08.598 --> 02:10.601
ISN'T IT A LITTLE IMMATURE?

02:10.601 --> 02:14.134
MY RAGE NEEDS AN OUTLET.
AND YOU GOT TO ADMIT,

02:14.134 --> 02:17.838
IT BEATS SMASHING HIS HEAD IN
WITH A 9-IRON.
 WELL, THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION.

02:17.838 --> 02:20.711
YOU COULD TELL HIM YOU KNOW
AND DEAL WITH IT.
 NO.

02:20.711 --> 02:24.875
WELL, WHY NOT?
 BECAUSE THEN
HE'LL TELL ME HE'S SORRY,

02:24.875 --> 02:29.620
AND I'LL CRY, AND HE'LL CRY,
AND THEN I'LL GET OVER IT.

02:29.620 --> 02:32.753
AND I'M NOT READY
TO GET OVER IT.

02:32.753 --> 02:36.287
I HAVE A LOT OF ANGER
TO WORK THROUGH

02:36.287 --> 02:38.729
BEFORE WE SWEEP THIS
UNDER THE CARPET AND MOVE ON,

02:38.729 --> 02:41.392
SO PLEASE DON'T TELL HIM
WHAT I'M DOING.

02:41.392 --> 02:44.795
BUT, LYNETTE, IT--
 COME ON. IT'S NOT LIKE
ANYBODY'S GETTING HURT.

02:44.795 --> 02:45.796
(Tom) OOH!

02:45.796 --> 02:47.438
(gasps)
 (gasps)

02:47.438 --> 02:49.700
TOM! ARE YOU OKAY?

02:49.700 --> 02:52.303
YEAH. I SLIPPED ON SOMETHING.

02:52.303 --> 02:54.575
PEANUT BUTTER? HOW--
WHAT--

02:54.575 --> 02:56.807
THOSE DAMN KIDS.

02:58.309 --> 03:04.915
YES, LYNETTE SCAVO HAD
DEVELOPED A TASTE FOR REVENGE.

03:04.915 --> 03:19.400
AND SHE WAS FINDING IT
DELICIOUS.

03:19.400 --> 03:25.336
WE PASS BY THESE PEOPLE
EVERY DAY.

03:25.336 --> 03:29.910
WE SENSE THEIR ISOLATION...

03:29.910 --> 03:35.316
BUT WE JUST KEEP WALKING...

03:35.316 --> 03:39.790
TELLING OURSELVES THERE'S
NOTHING WE CAN DO TO HELP...

03:39.790 --> 03:42.793
WHICH WE KNOW IS A LIE.

03:42.793 --> 03:45.996
HELLO, REVEREND.
WONDERFUL SERMON TODAY.

03:45.996 --> 03:47.828
THANK YOU, BREE.
DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT?

03:47.828 --> 03:50.601
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING.
 SURE.

03:50.601 --> 03:52.903
ONE OF OUR PARISHIONERS IS GOING
THROUGH A PERSONAL CRISIS.

03:52.903 --> 03:55.936
SHE'S IN DESPERATE NEED OF
A FRIEND--SOMEONE TO TALK TO.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.269
AND YOU THOUGHT OF ME?
I'M FLATTERED.

03:58.269 --> 04:00.841
SO YOU WOULDN'T MIND
REACHING OUT TO THIS LOST LAMB?

04:00.841 --> 04:05.846
OH, YOU ARE THE VERY MILK
OF HUMAN KINDNESS.
 NOW, STOP. I'M HAPPY TO HELP.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.953
UNLESS YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT BETH YOUNG, IN WHICH CASE

04:12.953 --> 04:16.687
I'D RATHER SHAVE MY HEAD
AND JOIN THE HARE KRISHNAS.
 BREE!

04:16.687 --> 04:20.690
I'M SORRY, BUT SHE IS MARRIED TO
THE BIGGEST LUNATIC IN FAIRVIEW.

04:20.690 --> 04:22.693
HE TRIED TO DESTROY
OUR NEIGHBORHOOD,

04:22.693 --> 04:26.036
AND SHE DID NOTHING
TO STOP HIM.
 STILL, THE CHRISTIAN THING
IS TO OFFER HER SOLACE.

04:26.036 --> 04:27.468
AFTER ALL,

04:27.468 --> 04:29.970
"LET HIM WHO IS WITHOUT SIN
CAST THE FIRST STONE."

04:29.970 --> 04:31.942
JOHN, CHAPTER 8, VERSE 7.

04:31.942 --> 04:33.374
WHAT ABOUT,

04:33.374 --> 04:35.906
"THE RIGHTEOUS WILL BE GLAD
WHEN THEY ARE AVENGED,

04:35.906 --> 04:38.579
WHEN THEY BATHE THEIR FEET
IN THE BLOOD OF THE WICKED"?

04:38.579 --> 04:41.352
PSALM 56, VERSE 10.

04:41.352 --> 04:44.014
"IF YOU DO NOT FORGIVE OTHERS
THEIR SINS,

04:44.014 --> 04:45.756
YOUR FATHER
WILL NOT FORGIVE YOURS."

04:45.756 --> 04:47.858
MATTHEW, CHAPTER 6, VERSE 15.

04:47.858 --> 04:50.521
"WHOEVER DOES NOT OBEY
THE LAWS OF GOD

04:50.521 --> 04:52.893
MUST SURELY BE PUNISHED
BY DEATH OR BANISHMENT."

04:52.893 --> 04:55.796
EZRA, CHAPTER 7, VERSE 26.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.999
"BREE VAN DE KAMP IS SHACKING UP
WITH HER BOYFRIEND."

04:58.999 --> 05:02.333
CYNTHIA THOMAS,
PEW 5, SEAT 7.

05:04.835 --> 05:07.378
FINE. I'LL TALK TO HER.

05:07.378 --> 05:09.440
BUT THIS IS
SPIRITUAL BLACKMAIL!

05:09.440 --> 05:11.442
I'M A MAN OF GOD, BREE.

05:11.442 --> 05:14.845
I DO WHAT IT TAKES
TO GET THE JOB DONE.

05:14.845 --> 05:17.418
(sighs)

05:17.418 --> 05:20.891
(Bob) EVERYTHING'S DELICIOUS,
GABY.

05:20.891 --> 05:23.323
THANK YOU. I'M GLAD
YOU GUYS COULD COME.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.556
YOU KNOW US. WE NEVER TURN DOWN
A CHAMPAGNE BRUNCH.
 (laughs)

05:25.556 --> 05:27.698
WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT CHAMPAGNE?
 I DID.

05:27.698 --> 05:30.901
COME ON, PEOPLE! WE NEED SOME
BUBBLY! WE GOTTA CELEBRATE!

05:30.901 --> 05:32.563
CELEBRATE WHAT?

05:34.004 --> 05:36.537
YOU--
 OKAY, IT'S KIND OF
A LONG STORY.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.939
IT ALL STARTED LAST YEAR.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.912
WE'RE ADOPTING A CHILD.
YOU WERE KILLING THE MOMENT.

05:41.912 --> 05:44.415
MEET LIZA HUNTER-McDERMOTT.

05:44.415 --> 05:45.746
LIZA?

05:45.746 --> 05:48.579
GUESS WHO LOST THAT COIN TOSS.
 (chuckles)

05:48.579 --> 05:50.350
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.822
THERE WAS A 2-YEAR WAIT
FOR A BABY.

05:51.822 --> 05:54.585
BUT WE FOUND THIS ORPHANAGE
THAT HAD LOTS OF OLDER KIDS.

05:54.585 --> 05:57.788
SO WE FIGURED, WHY NOT?
SHE'S 10 YEARS OLD.

05:57.788 --> 06:01.592
AND IF ALL GOES WELL,
SHE'S OURS NEXT MONTH.

06:01.592 --> 06:04.695
WELL, WE'RE REALLY HAPPY
FOR YOU GUYS.

06:04.695 --> 06:06.837
AREN'T WE, GABY?

06:10.601 --> 06:12.603
GABY, WHAT'S WRONG?

06:12.603 --> 06:15.806
UH, NOTHING.
I'M THRILLED FOR YOU. REALLY.

06:15.806 --> 06:18.509
OH, HONEY.
WE DIDN'T EVEN THINK--

06:18.509 --> 06:20.811
WITH EVERYTHING YOU'VE BEEN
GOING THROUGH--
 SHE'S FINE.

06:20.811 --> 06:22.413
IT'S JUST...

06:22.413 --> 06:24.785
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE GRACE IS, OR...

06:24.785 --> 06:29.089
HOW SHE IS, OR WHEN
I'M GONNA SEE HER AGAIN.
 GABY.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.123
WE DIDN'T MEAN
TO UPSET YOU GUYS.

06:33.123 --> 06:37.428
IT'S FINE. SHE'S GONE, AND NOW
GABY AND I ARE MOVING ON.

06:37.428 --> 06:39.670
AND WE'VE AGREED
NOT TO TALK ABOUT IT

06:39.670 --> 06:41.672
BECAUSE IT IS SO PAINFUL.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.776
I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND.

06:45.776 --> 06:48.408
OF COURSE.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.410
SO, PLEASE, TELL US MORE
ABOUT YOUR LITTLE GIRL.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.483
WHAT IS SHE LIKE?
 UH, YOU'RE GONNA LOVE HER.

06:52.483 --> 06:54.945
I MEAN, SHE'S SO SMART
AND SO FUNNY.
 THE FIRST TIME

06:54.945 --> 06:57.918
WE WALKED IN THAT ROOM, THERE
WAS THIS INSTANT CONNECTION.

06:57.918 --> 07:02.192
WE JUST KNEW SHE WAS OURS.
 YOU KNOW WHAT? WE SHOULD MAKE
A TOAST TO LITTLE LIZA.

07:02.192 --> 07:04.194
I'M GONNA GET THAT CHAMPAGNE.

07:12.032 --> 07:15.035
(breathing heavily)

07:35.085 --> 07:38.128
LOOK WHO I FOUND.

07:38.128 --> 07:41.632
JULIE! (giggles)

07:41.632 --> 07:46.637
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I TOLD YOU NOT TO FLY HOME.

07:46.637 --> 07:49.600
OH, MOM. HAVEN'T YOU LEARNED I
DON'T LISTEN TO A WORD YOU SAY?

07:49.600 --> 07:51.842
BESIDES, THEY WON'T LET YOU
MAIL A MAJOR ORGAN.

07:51.842 --> 07:55.946
OH, NO. NO, DON'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT IT.

07:55.946 --> 07:58.949
YOU ARE NOT GONNA BE MY DONOR.
 I DID TONS OF RESEARCH.

07:58.949 --> 08:01.011
THEY HAVE THESE
NEW SURGICAL TECHNIQUES.

08:01.011 --> 08:03.914
IT'S NO WORSE
THAN A BELLY PIERCING...

08:03.914 --> 08:06.917
WHICH I DID NOT DO.
 YOU KNOW, THE DOCTOR DID SAY

08:06.917 --> 08:09.760
THAT BLOOD RELATIVES ARE
YOUR BEST CHANCE FOR A MATCH.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.992
HONEY, YOU ARE NOT GOING
THROUGH THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

08:11.992 --> 08:14.595
WITH ONLY ONE KIDNEY.
 BUT, MOM--

08:14.595 --> 08:17.698
NO. I'M GOING ON THE WAIT LIST.
 THAT COULD TAKE YEARS.

08:17.698 --> 08:20.070
YOU KNOW,
THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION.
 (sighs)

08:20.070 --> 08:23.734
SOMEBODY WHO'S CLOSE TO YOU
THAT LOVES YOU VERY MUCH.

08:23.734 --> 08:27.507
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.
YOU'RE NOT THE RIGHT BLOOD TYPE.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.640
I MEANT YOUR MOTHER.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.682
MY MOTHER?

08:31.682 --> 08:34.684
MIKE, I ALREADY LOST MY KIDNEY.
NOW YOU WANT ME TO LOSE MY MIND?

08:34.684 --> 08:36.847
NO, NO, NO, NO.

08:36.847 --> 08:39.549
WE ARE NOT ASKING HER
 FOR A KIDNEY.

08:39.549 --> 08:42.292
NO. IN FACT, WE'RE NOT EVEN
TELLING HER ABOUT THIS.

08:42.292 --> 08:44.555
WE'RE NOT?

08:44.555 --> 08:47.558
OF COURSE NOT. UH--IF SHE HEARD
ONE WORD ABOUT THIS--

08:47.558 --> 08:51.702
OH, MY GOD.
JULIE, WHAT DID YOU DO?
 I'M SORRY. I--

08:51.702 --> 08:54.705
YOU'RE HURT. I THOUGHT YOU'D
WANT HER TO KNOW. AND, UH...

08:54.705 --> 08:58.168
SHE'LL BE HERE TOMORROW.
 OH, MY GOD!

08:58.168 --> 09:01.271
I-I'VE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.
UNHOOK ME. UNHOOK ME!
 NO, NO. SUSAN, THIS IS GOOD.

09:01.271 --> 09:06.146
YOU NEED A KIDNEY,
SHE'S GOT A KIDNEY...
 THAT I WILL BE PAYING FOR
THE REST OF MY LIFE!

09:06.146 --> 09:08.819
"HOW COME YOU HAVEN'T VISITED?
I GAVE YOU MY KIDNEY."

09:08.819 --> 09:11.822
"WHY WON'T YOU FRIEND ME ON
FACEBOOK? I GAVE YOU MY KIDNEY."

09:11.822 --> 09:15.826
NO. THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.
YOU OWE ME, JULIE--BIG.

09:15.826 --> 09:17.127
YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:17.127 --> 09:20.761
HOW ABOUT I GIVE YOU
A KIDNEY?

09:20.761 --> 09:22.262
BIGGER THAN THAT.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.750
DON'T REACT.

09:39.750 --> 09:41.852
AAH!
 GOOD NOT REACTING.

09:41.852 --> 09:44.855
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING
BACK THERE?
 I CAN'T LET HER SEE ME
TALKING TO YOU.

09:44.855 --> 09:48.619
WHO?
 LYNETTE. SHE KNOWS.

09:48.619 --> 09:52.222
KNOWS WHAT? A-ABOUT US?

09:52.222 --> 09:55.595
HOW?
 WHO CARES HOW?
THE POINT IS, SHE FOUND OUT.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.769
WHY HASN'T SHE
SAID ANYTHING TO ME?
 OH, SHE'S SAYING IT--

09:58.769 --> 10:01.271
YOUR PANTS SPLITTING OPEN,
FALLING DOWN THE STAIRS--

10:01.271 --> 10:05.035
HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED YOU'VE BEEN
A LITTLE ACCIDENT-PRONE LATELY?
 THAT WAS HER?

10:05.035 --> 10:07.808
MM.
 SO SHE'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR MY FLAT TIRE?

10:07.808 --> 10:09.139
MM-HMM.

10:09.139 --> 10:11.682
THE SARDINES IN MY GYM BAG?
 YEP.

10:11.682 --> 10:14.614
THE GAY PORN
IN MY PowerPoint PRESENTATION?
 HER PROUDEST MOMENT.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.047
SO SHE'S JUST GONNA KEEP ON
SCREWING WITH ME?

10:17.047 --> 10:20.921
I MEAN, WHAT ELSE HAS
SHE GOT PLANNED?
 I DON'T KNOW,
BUT SHE IS ONE ANGRY WOMAN.

10:20.921 --> 10:23.694
BE CAREFUL. GOD KNOWS
WHAT SHE'LL DO NEXT.

10:23.694 --> 10:25.696
(brakes squeal)

10:25.696 --> 10:27.928
OW! WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

10:27.928 --> 10:30.931
TESTING THE BRAKES
BEFORE I GET ON THE HIGHWAY.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.963
(sighs)

10:35.335 --> 10:37.838
HI! I-I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU OUT
IN A WHILE,

10:37.838 --> 10:41.241
SO I THOUGHT I'D STOP BY
AND SEE HOW YOU WERE DOING.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.343
WHAT DO YOU REALLY WANT?

10:43.343 --> 10:44.775
UM...

10:44.775 --> 10:47.647
WELL, I TALKED
TO REVEREND SYKES YESTERDAY,

10:47.647 --> 10:50.220
AND HE TELLS ME THAT
YOU'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH

10:50.220 --> 10:52.222
KIND OF A ROUGH PATCH.

10:54.284 --> 10:56.126
COME ON IN.

10:58.789 --> 11:03.363
YOU KNOW, GROWING UP, I DIDN'T
REALLY HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS.

11:03.363 --> 11:06.697
WE WEREN'T
A VERY... SOCIAL FAMILY.

11:06.697 --> 11:08.699
BUT I WAS NEVER HATED.

11:08.699 --> 11:10.871
NOBODY HATES YOU.

11:10.871 --> 11:13.944
BUT THEY HATE MY HUSBAND...
DON'T THEY?

11:16.076 --> 11:18.779
I JUST WISH PEOPLE
COULD UNDERSTAND HIM.

11:18.779 --> 11:23.253
HE IS NOT A BAD MAN. IT'S JUST,
HIS LIFE HAS BEEN SO DIFFICULT.

11:23.253 --> 11:26.256
HE WENT TO PRISON FOR A MURDER
HE DIDN'T COMMIT.

11:26.256 --> 11:28.819
HIS WIFE KILLED HERSELF.

11:28.819 --> 11:31.221
HIS SON HATES HIM.

11:33.463 --> 11:35.996
HE'S BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

11:35.996 --> 11:40.000
WELL, I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
CONVINCE PEOPLE TO LIKE PAUL,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.273
BUT THERE'S NO REASON YOU SHOULD
SUFFER FOR WHAT HE'S DONE.

11:43.273 --> 11:45.776
I AM HAVING THE GIRLS OVER
THIS WEEK,

11:45.776 --> 11:48.739
AND I THINK IT WOULD BE
WONDERFUL IF YOU'D JOIN US.

11:48.739 --> 11:50.480
OH.

11:50.480 --> 11:52.913
THAT'S VERY SWEET.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.945
BUT I THINK WE BOTH KNOW

11:54.945 --> 11:56.987
THOSE WOMEN
AREN'T GONNA WANT ME THERE.

11:56.987 --> 11:58.919
THOSE WOMEN
ARE MY DEAR FRIENDS.

11:58.919 --> 12:01.021
TRUST ME.
THEY'LL BE FINE WITH IT.

12:01.021 --> 12:03.093
AND IF THEY'RE NOT?

12:03.093 --> 12:06.396
WELL, THEN I'LL JUST HAVE TO
TWIST SOME VERY DEAR ARMS.

12:06.396 --> 12:08.498
(chuckles)
 (click)

12:08.498 --> 12:11.361
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

12:11.361 --> 12:14.304
OKAY, MRS. DELFINO.
YOU'RE ALL HOOKED UP.

12:14.304 --> 12:15.806
(Sophie) WHERE'S MY DAUGHTER?

12:15.806 --> 12:19.439
THEY SAID SHE WAS DOWN HERE.
DO YOU SEE HER?
 OH, GOD.

12:19.439 --> 12:23.774
ARE YOU IN PAIN?
 NO, BUT I WILL BE.

12:23.774 --> 12:25.876
OH! SUSAN.

12:25.876 --> 12:27.447
MOM.

12:27.447 --> 12:30.420
OH, MY POOR, SICK BABY.

12:30.420 --> 12:33.954
HELLO, MIKE. OH, HONEY.

12:33.954 --> 12:37.127
(singsongy)
I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

12:37.127 --> 12:39.790
ONE OF YOUR FAVORITE THINGS
FROM HOME.

12:39.790 --> 12:41.031
GET IN HERE!

12:41.031 --> 12:43.794
(laughs)

12:43.794 --> 12:45.295
AUNT CLAIRE.

12:45.295 --> 12:48.438
SHE FIGURED
I WAS CHEAPER THAN FLOWERS.

12:48.438 --> 12:51.441
UH, MIKE,
YOU HAVEN'T MET MY AUNT.

12:51.441 --> 12:54.504
UH, SHE TAUGHT ME HOW TO MAKE
A MANHATTAN WHEN I WAS 8.

12:54.504 --> 12:57.407
I HAD HER UP TO OLD FASHIONEDS
BY THE TIME SHE WAS 12--

12:57.407 --> 13:01.882
AND THAT'S A DIFFICULT DRINK.
 SHE'S LIKE THE BARTENDER
I NEVER HAD.

13:01.882 --> 13:04.384
AW. SO, SWEETHEART,

13:04.384 --> 13:07.387
YOUR MOTHER TELLS ME YOU HAVE
A DEFORMED KIDNEY.

13:07.387 --> 13:11.862
I TOLD HER NOT TO SLEEP
ON HER SIDE.

13:13.393 --> 13:17.397
WELL, WE'RE HOPING TO FIND
A DONOR VERY SOON.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.170
OH. WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE?

13:20.170 --> 13:22.873
I WONDER WHO IT'LL BE.

13:22.873 --> 13:26.036
YOU READ ALL THESE STORIES--
STRANGERS BROUGHT TOGETHER

13:26.036 --> 13:28.408
THROUGH LIFE-THREATENING
CIRCUMSTANCES.

13:28.408 --> 13:31.912
OUR BEST BET IS A MATCH
WITHIN THE FAMILY.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.443
OH!

13:33.443 --> 13:35.886
LIKE JULIE!

13:35.886 --> 13:37.387
NO.

13:37.387 --> 13:38.448
M.J.

13:38.448 --> 13:40.350
HE'S 9, MOM.

13:40.350 --> 13:42.592
YOU DON'T TAKE A KIDNEY
OUT OF A 9-YEAR-OLD.

13:42.592 --> 13:45.055
WELL, IT'D TAKE CARE OF
THAT BED-WETTING PROBLEM,

13:45.055 --> 13:46.997
THOUGH, WOULDN'T IT?

13:46.997 --> 13:48.999
YOU KNOW,
WE WERE ACTUALLY THINKING

13:48.999 --> 13:52.262
THAT... YOU MIGHT BE
A POSSIBLE DONOR, SOPHIE.

13:55.005 --> 13:56.536
OH.

13:56.536 --> 14:00.570
(gasps) O-OH.

14:00.570 --> 14:02.472
"OH"?

14:02.472 --> 14:04.414
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "OH"?

14:04.414 --> 14:06.917
WELL, IT--IT'S--IT'S JUST...

14:06.917 --> 14:08.618
IT--IT'S... (sighs)

14:08.618 --> 14:12.382
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

14:12.382 --> 14:14.084
SHE'S NOT GONNA DO IT.

14:14.084 --> 14:16.456
OF COURSE, SHE WANTS TO.

14:16.456 --> 14:19.289
IT'S... IT'S JUST
THE TIMING OF THINGS.

14:19.289 --> 14:22.963
MORTY AND I ARE
ABOUT TO TAKE A CRUISE...

14:22.963 --> 14:25.035
FOR THREE MONTHS.

14:25.035 --> 14:26.296
A CRUISE?

14:26.296 --> 14:28.538
(singsongy) NONREFUNDABLE.
(chuckles nervously)

14:28.538 --> 14:33.573
AND YOU WON'T
EVEN GET TESTED.

14:33.573 --> 14:36.576
YOU KNOW, WE HAVEN'T EVEN
CHECKED IN AT THE HOTEL YET.

14:36.576 --> 14:39.509
UH, WHY DON'T WE DO THAT?
 YES, OKAY.

14:39.509 --> 14:43.914
WE'LL BE BACK IN AN HOUR OR TWO.
AND IF YOU'RE BETTER,

14:43.914 --> 14:46.356
IF YOU FEEL LIKE IT,
MAYBE WE'LL TAKE YOU SHOPPING.

14:46.356 --> 14:50.120
ACTUALLY, I'M HAVING MY BLOOD
WASHED FOR THE NEXT SIX HOURS.

14:50.120 --> 14:53.493
BUT GO! YOU TWO HAVE FUN.

15:05.235 --> 15:08.578
♪ I'VE BEEN WORKIN'
ON THE RAILROAD ♪

15:08.578 --> 15:13.043
♪ ALL THE LIVELONG DAY ♪

15:13.043 --> 15:16.446
♪ I'VE BEEN WORKIN'
ON THE RAILROAD ♪

15:16.446 --> 15:20.250

15:28.228 --> 15:29.559
HEY THERE.

15:29.559 --> 15:32.432
OH! PERFECT TIMING.

15:32.432 --> 15:36.006
I MADE YOUR FAVORITE--
DOUBLE FUDGE BROWNIES.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.639
WELL, I HAD A BIG LUNCH,

15:39.639 --> 15:42.342
AND I DON'T WANT
ANY MORE PANTS RIPPING,

15:42.342 --> 15:44.444
SO... NO, THANKS.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.946
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
YOU LOOK GREAT.

15:46.946 --> 15:50.480
(dish clatters)
 HAVE ONE. IT WON'T KILL YA.

15:58.488 --> 16:00.730
YEAH. MAYBE LATER.

16:00.730 --> 16:04.534
ARE YOU SURE?
THEY'RE TASTY.

16:06.366 --> 16:09.039
OOH. BROWNIES. CAN I HAVE ONE?

16:09.039 --> 16:10.500
UH... NO.

16:10.500 --> 16:13.503
YEAH. SURE, PENNY, HAVE ONE.

16:13.503 --> 16:14.644
NO!

16:14.644 --> 16:18.278
I MEAN... (chuckles) I DON'T
WANT HER TO SPOIL HER DINNER.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.280
BESIDES, I MADE THESE
FOR YOUR DAD.

16:20.280 --> 16:23.383
OH, I CAN SHARE.

16:23.383 --> 16:26.486
HERE, PENNY. TAKE IT.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.158
EAT IT.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.993
(dish clatters)
 NO!

16:33.993 --> 16:36.026
AHA!

16:36.026 --> 16:37.527
YOU GUYS ARE WEIRD.

16:37.527 --> 16:41.071
WHAT'D YOU PUT IN THERE--
CAYENNE PEPPER? DRAIN CLEANER?

16:41.071 --> 16:43.033
SO RENEE TOLD YOU.

16:43.033 --> 16:46.536
I AM GONNA KILL HER.
 LET'S GET BACK TO HOW
YOU'RE TRYING TO KILL ME!

16:46.536 --> 16:49.239
DON'T YOU DARE ACT LIKE
THE INJURED PARTY HERE.

16:49.239 --> 16:51.211
YOU BETRAYED ME!
YOU HAD AN AFFAIR!

16:51.211 --> 16:55.385
IT WASN'T AN AFFAIR!
IT WAS COMPLETELY MEANINGLESS!

16:55.385 --> 16:58.448
IT WAS AFTER WE WERE ENGAGED!
 (thud)

16:58.448 --> 17:00.690
NO, WE HAD BROKEN UP,
REMEMBER?

17:00.690 --> 17:02.692
NO, NO, WE WERE TAKING
A BREAK, REMEMBER?

17:02.692 --> 17:04.694
YES, WE WERE FIGHTING
CONSTANTLY,

17:04.694 --> 17:07.396
SO WE DECIDED TO SPEND
SOME TIME APART

17:07.396 --> 17:10.500
TO DECIDE WHETHER WE WERE
 GONNA GET MARRIED OR SPLIT UP.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.602
RIGHT!
 SO I WENT TO MY MOM'S HOUSE

17:12.602 --> 17:15.605
TO THINK ABOUT IT,
AND I WILL NEVER FORGET THIS.

17:15.605 --> 17:18.568
I WAS SITTING IN THE KITCHEN.
MY MOM WAS MAKING A FRITTATA.

17:18.568 --> 17:22.271
AND I THOUGHT, "OH,
I SHOULD MAKE THAT FOR TOM,"

17:22.271 --> 17:25.815
AND THEN IT HIT ME.
THERE MIGHT BE NO TOM.

17:25.815 --> 17:31.321
I MIGHT NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN.
AND I HAD AN EPIPHANY.

17:31.321 --> 17:34.424
I DIDN'T WANT A LIFE
WITHOUT YOU IN IT.

17:34.424 --> 17:37.287
YEAH. I WAS AT A CROSSROADS,

17:37.287 --> 17:40.230
AND I CHOSE THE PATH
THAT INCLUDED YOU,

17:40.230 --> 17:42.532
AND YOU KNOW WHAT KILLS ME?

17:42.532 --> 17:44.534
WHILE I WAS MAKING
THAT DECISION,

17:44.534 --> 17:48.768
YOU WERE OFF... (voice breaks)
SLEEPING WITH MY BEST FRIEND.

17:52.542 --> 17:54.504
OHH! THAT WAS FUN.
 MM-HMM.

17:54.504 --> 17:57.507
I'VE BEEN KIND OF DOWN LATELY,
AND, WELL...

17:57.507 --> 17:59.609
NOTHING LIKE
A LITTLE RETAIL THERAPY.

17:59.609 --> 18:02.782
(chuckles) YES, I'D SAY
YOU HAD A REAL BREAKTHROUGH

18:02.782 --> 18:05.385
AROUND THE FOURTH SHOE STORE.
 (chuckles)

18:05.385 --> 18:07.687
PLEASE TELL ME CARLOS
ISN'T HAVING AN AFFAIR

18:07.687 --> 18:10.320
WITH A TINY NAKED PERSON.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.365
CELIA! JUANITA!

18:17.397 --> 18:20.470
OH, MY GOD! WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?!

18:20.470 --> 18:23.773
PLAYING WITH MY NEW DOLL.
LOOK, SHE CAN LEAP OFF CLIFFS.

18:23.773 --> 18:27.377
(thud)
 NO, NO!
THIS IS NOT YOUR DOLL!

18:27.377 --> 18:30.440
THEN WHOSE IS IT?
I FOUND IT IN YOUR CLOSET.

18:30.440 --> 18:34.144
OH, MY GOD. WHERE'S HER ARM?
 WHERE'S HER ARM?!

18:34.144 --> 18:37.487
OHH. FOR GOD SAKES.

18:37.487 --> 18:39.249
CELIA, THIS IS NOT A TOY!

18:39.249 --> 18:40.890
YEAH, IT IS.

18:40.890 --> 18:43.893
NO! IT'S NOT! IT'S SOMETHING
SPECIAL THAT BELONGS TO ME!

18:43.893 --> 18:46.896
IT IS MINE, AND NO ONE
CAN TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME!

18:46.896 --> 18:48.898
I'M SORRY.
I COULDN'T HELP OVERHEARING.

18:48.898 --> 18:51.401
IS EVERYTHING OKAY IN HERE?

18:51.401 --> 18:53.733
MOMMY'S MAD BECAUSE
WE PLAYED WITH HER DOLL.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.866
GO TO YOUR ROOM. GO! BOTH!

19:00.139 --> 19:02.172
YOUR DOLL?

19:02.172 --> 19:04.174
OF COURSE IT'S NOT MINE.

19:04.174 --> 19:07.777
IT'S... A GIFT
FOR BOB AND LEE.

19:07.777 --> 19:10.280
THEY'RE ADOPTING
A LITTLE GIRL.

19:12.822 --> 19:14.924
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

19:14.924 --> 19:17.156
LET ME
GET YOUR DISCHARGE PAPERS,

19:17.156 --> 19:20.460
AND I'LL BE BACK
TO WHEEL YOU OUT.
 THANK YOU.

19:20.460 --> 19:23.162
HEY, UH, MIKE'S BRINGING
THE CAR AROUND FRONT.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.595
I WILL, UH, GET YOUR BAG.

19:25.595 --> 19:28.638
HEY, WHAT IS THAT ON YOUR ARM?
DID YOU GET A BLOOD TEST?

19:28.638 --> 19:32.842
I JUST... WANTED TO SEE--
 I AM NOT TAKING YOUR KIDNEY.

19:32.842 --> 19:35.345
RELAX. I WASN'T A MATCH.

19:35.345 --> 19:37.677
BUT IF I WAS
AND I DIDN'T CHECK,

19:37.677 --> 19:40.650
I NEVER WOULD'VE
FORGIVEN MYSELF.

19:40.650 --> 19:42.652
COME HERE.

19:46.816 --> 19:48.688
YOU KNOW...

19:48.688 --> 19:52.362
WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP,

19:52.362 --> 19:55.725
SOMETIMES I FELT LIKE
I WAS JUST WINGING IT.

19:55.725 --> 19:57.227
(chuckles)

19:57.227 --> 19:58.468
AND THEN I SEE

19:58.468 --> 20:00.830
THE INCREDIBLE WOMAN
YOU'VE BECOME,

20:00.830 --> 20:03.903
AND I KNOW I DID
SOMETHING RIGHT. (chuckles)

20:03.903 --> 20:05.305
(chuckles)

20:05.305 --> 20:08.207
(Sophie) WH-WHERE'S MY DAUGHTER?
DID THEY MOVE HER?

20:08.207 --> 20:11.210
(Claire) I'M TELLING YOU,
IT'S THE OTHER END OF THE HALL.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.385
I'M HERE!

20:15.385 --> 20:18.518
OHH! HELLO, SWEETIE.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.350
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:20.350 --> 20:23.353
WELL, YOU'RE GETTING DISCHARGED
TODAY, AND I CAME TO HELP.

20:23.353 --> 20:25.495
LET ME TAKE THAT BAG.

20:25.495 --> 20:27.997
NO. I WOULDN'T WANT YOU
TO PULL SOMETHING

20:27.997 --> 20:31.301
AND NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY
SHUFFLEBOARD ON YOUR CRUISE.

20:31.301 --> 20:34.304
(gasps) WELL... (chuckles)
HOW ABOUT I TAKE US ALL OUT

20:34.304 --> 20:36.406
FOR A NICE LUNCH?

20:36.406 --> 20:37.867
I CAN'T.
I'M ON A RESTRICTED DIET,

20:37.867 --> 20:40.370
AND M.J. IS WAITING
FOR ME AT HOME.

20:40.370 --> 20:42.812
I'D LIKE TO BE THERE
FOR MY CHILD.

20:44.013 --> 20:46.376
COME ON. LET'S GO.

20:46.376 --> 20:48.878
LET ME AT LEAST
PUSH YOUR CHAIR.

20:48.878 --> 20:50.480
I'M GOOD.

20:50.480 --> 20:52.422
SUSIE, I WANT TO HELP.

20:52.422 --> 20:55.425
YOU DO NOT GET TO "HELP"
BY PUSHING MY WHEELCHAIR.

20:55.425 --> 20:57.427
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE
TO HELP.

20:57.427 --> 20:58.928
SUSAN, BE FAIR.

20:58.928 --> 21:00.990
NO!

21:00.990 --> 21:04.894
HOW COULD YOU REFUSE
TO EVEN BE TESTED?

21:04.894 --> 21:06.866
MY OWN MOTHER!

21:06.866 --> 21:09.369
JULIE COULDN'T WAIT TO HAND OVER
ONE OF HER KIDNEYS.

21:09.369 --> 21:12.372
WELL, THERE YOU GO.
PROBLEM SOLVED.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.673
I WASN'T A MATCH.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.675
THAT IS NOT THE POINT.

21:15.675 --> 21:18.408
YOU ONLY HAD A 15% CHANCE
OF BEING A MATCH.

21:18.408 --> 21:20.510
THAT MEANT THERE WAS
AN 85% CHANCE

21:20.510 --> 21:23.513
THAT I'D NEVER KNOW
HOW LITTLE YOU CARED ABOUT ME.

21:23.513 --> 21:25.515
I COULD'VE GONE
THE REST OF MY LIFE

21:25.515 --> 21:27.387
THINKING YOU WERE
A WONDERFUL MOTHER

21:27.387 --> 21:30.390
WHO HAD THE WRONG KIND
OF KIDNEY.
 NOW WAIT A SECOND HERE--

21:30.390 --> 21:32.862
NO, NO, NO, NO, CLAIRE.
IT'S OKAY.

21:34.494 --> 21:39.429
I AM... SORRY
I DISAPPOINTED YOU, HONEY.

22:03.923 --> 22:05.425
HEY.

22:05.425 --> 22:07.397
CAN WE TALK FOR A MINUTE?

22:07.397 --> 22:09.529
THAT DEPENDS. ARE YOU ALONE?

22:09.529 --> 22:12.402
YES.
 THEN WE CAN TALK.
YOU WANNA COME IN?

22:12.402 --> 22:15.635
THAT DEPENDS.
DO YOU HAVE BEER?
 YES.

22:15.635 --> 22:17.907
THEN I'LL COME IN.

22:17.907 --> 22:20.940
I, UH, I NEED A FAVOR.

22:20.940 --> 22:24.043
I WANT YOU TO LET YOUR MOM
OFF THE HOOK.

22:24.043 --> 22:28.778
NO WAY.
I'M--I'M DONE WITH HER.

22:28.778 --> 22:33.423
SUSAN, THERE ARE SOME...
(sighs) THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW.

22:33.423 --> 22:34.724
(bottle cap clatters)

22:34.724 --> 22:36.556
LIKE WHAT?

22:36.556 --> 22:38.488
WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY
TELL ME

22:38.488 --> 22:40.129
THAT WOULD EXCUSE
HER BEHAVIOR?

22:40.129 --> 22:42.832
I'M HER DAUGHTER.
THIS IS MY HOUR OF NEED,

22:42.832 --> 22:46.396
AND SHE'S NOT EVEN
TRYING TO HELP.

22:46.396 --> 22:49.098
NO. I'M NOT GONNA
FORGIVE HER FOR THIS, EVER.

22:51.040 --> 22:53.773
SHE HAS CANCER.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.745
WHAT?

22:55.745 --> 22:57.477
BREAST CANCER.

22:57.477 --> 23:01.781
THEY CAUGHT IT EARLY,
AND... WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES.

23:01.781 --> 23:04.814
SHE'S STARTING CHEMO
NEXT WEEK.

23:04.814 --> 23:06.085
(sighs)

23:06.085 --> 23:08.087
WELL,
WHAT ABOUT THE CRUISE?

23:08.087 --> 23:10.089
(chuckles)
THAT IS THE CRUISE.

23:10.089 --> 23:12.121
THAT'S THE STORY
WE'RE TELLING

23:12.121 --> 23:15.425
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T
WANT YOU TO KNOW.

23:15.425 --> 23:17.597
AND THAT'S WHY...

23:17.597 --> 23:19.969
SHE CAN'T GIVE YOU
A KIDNEY.

23:19.969 --> 23:22.972
WHY WOULDN'T SHE TELL ME?
THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

23:22.972 --> 23:24.974
YOU KNOW MOM.
I MEAN, SINCE WHEN

23:24.974 --> 23:27.136
HAS SHE PASSED UP
A CHANCE FOR ATTENTION?

23:27.136 --> 23:31.641
EXACTLY. WHEN SHE HEARD ABOUT
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH,

23:31.641 --> 23:34.814
SHE... SHE DECIDED NO,
NOT THIS TIME.

23:34.814 --> 23:37.086
SHE WASN'T GONNA
BURDEN YOU.

23:37.086 --> 23:41.420
AND I JUMPED ALL OVER HER.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.422
I GOTTA GO TALK TO HER--

23:43.422 --> 23:45.995
NO, NO.
DON'T TELL HER YOU KNOW.

23:45.995 --> 23:47.196
WHY NOT?

23:47.196 --> 23:48.798
SUSAN, PLEASE.

23:48.798 --> 23:51.701
RESPECT WHAT
SHE'S TRYING TO DO HERE.

23:51.701 --> 23:56.566
SHE'S TRYING TO MAKE UP
FOR A LIFETIME OF "ME, ME, ME."

23:56.566 --> 23:58.668
LET HER.

24:02.211 --> 24:04.113
OH, DEAR.
THIS IS WHY PEOPLE

24:04.113 --> 24:06.816
SHOULD NEVER LET CHILDREN
PLAY WITH DOLLS.

24:06.816 --> 24:08.117
BUT DON'T WORRY.

24:08.117 --> 24:11.120
I'LL HAVE PRINCESS VALERIE
ALL SEWN UP AND GOOD AS NEW

24:11.120 --> 24:14.453
BY THE END OF THE DAY.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.162
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

24:23.162 --> 24:25.164
OF COURSE.

24:25.164 --> 24:29.468
AM I... WEIRD FOR BEING
SO ATTACHED TO A DOLL?

24:29.468 --> 24:32.772
I ONLY BOUGHT HER BECAUSE
I THOUGHT SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL,

24:32.772 --> 24:34.774
AND SHE REMINDED ME
OF SOMEONE,

24:34.774 --> 24:41.480
BUT LATELY... I'M STARTING
TO FEEL LIKE I NEED HER.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.153
SHE... CALMS ME DOWN
WHEN I GET UPSET,

24:44.153 --> 24:46.485
AND I ENJOY SPENDING TIME
WITH HER.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.988
THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING HERE
WITHOUT HER

24:48.988 --> 24:51.160
IS REALLY UPSETTING.

24:51.160 --> 24:53.793
THAT'S CRAZY, RIGHT?

24:53.793 --> 24:56.165
COME WITH ME.

24:59.198 --> 25:04.073
YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU'VE BEEN
FEELING IS ABSOLUTELY NORMAL.

25:04.073 --> 25:06.075
WELL, TELL THAT
TO MY FRIEND BREE.

25:06.075 --> 25:09.178
I WAS HOLDING THAT DOLL, AND SHE
LOOKED AT ME LIKE I WAS INSANE.

25:09.178 --> 25:11.581
MOST PEOPLE
WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND,

25:11.581 --> 25:13.783
BUT I DO.

25:13.783 --> 25:16.916
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
TO SOMEONE.

25:18.848 --> 25:22.021
THIS IS MRS. HUMPHRIES.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.924
I SAW HER IN A WINDOW
IN A TINY SHOP IN OHIO

25:24.924 --> 25:27.056
AND FELL IN LOVE,

25:27.056 --> 25:29.058
AND THE MORE TIME
WE SPENT TOGETHER,

25:29.058 --> 25:31.861
THE MORE I GOT TO KNOW
HER STORY.

25:31.861 --> 25:34.103
HER STORY?

25:34.103 --> 25:36.105
OF COURSE.
EVERY DOLL HAS A STORY,

25:36.105 --> 25:41.210
AND IT TURNS OUT MRS. HUMPHRIES
STARTED HER OWN BUSINESS,

25:41.210 --> 25:43.072
JUST LIKE I DID.

25:43.072 --> 25:46.315
SHE HAS A MUSIC SHOP,
AND SHE TEACHES PIANO.

25:48.177 --> 25:50.580
AND SHE... TOLD YOU THAT?

25:50.580 --> 25:53.252
GABY, DOLLS DON'T TALK.

25:53.252 --> 25:54.553
(chuckles)

25:54.553 --> 25:56.555
BUT EVEN SO,

25:56.555 --> 26:00.129
MRS. HUMPHRIES
IS ALWAYS THERE FOR ME.

26:00.129 --> 26:05.234
YOU SEE, HER SISTER PASSED AWAY
AROUND THE SAME TIME MINE DID.

26:05.234 --> 26:10.139
EVER SINCE...

26:10.139 --> 26:15.004
(whispers) SHE'S BROUGHT ME
SUCH HAPPINESS.

26:15.004 --> 26:17.947
ISN'T IT... FUNNY
HOW A DOLL CAN DO THAT?

26:17.947 --> 26:20.249
(normal voice)
AND THE BEST THING IS,

26:20.249 --> 26:23.082
THEY'LL NEVER LEAVE YOU.

26:25.114 --> 26:27.957
SO...

26:27.957 --> 26:30.159
WHAT'S YOUR DOLL'S STORY?

26:32.021 --> 26:33.322
I DON'T KNOW.

26:33.322 --> 26:36.866
(whispers)
OH, OF COURSE YOU DO.

26:38.998 --> 26:40.599
TELL ME.

26:42.702 --> 26:44.173
UH...

26:46.706 --> 26:52.712
UH... HER... NAME IS
PRINCESS VALERIE.

26:52.712 --> 26:54.343
SHE'S A PRINCESS.

26:56.045 --> 26:58.047
BUT SHE WASN'T ALWAYS ONE.

26:58.047 --> 27:00.619
REALLY?

27:00.619 --> 27:03.052
WHEN SHE WAS BORN,
THERE WAS A MIX-UP,

27:03.052 --> 27:05.354
AND SHE WAS GIVEN
TO THE WRONG FAMILY.

27:08.828 --> 27:11.130
(Gabrielle)
NOBODY KNEW FOR A LONG TIME.

27:11.130 --> 27:15.334
BUT THEN ONE DAY, SHE FINALLY
FOUND HER WAY HOME.

27:15.334 --> 27:18.267
FROM THAT DAY ON,

27:18.267 --> 27:21.811
PRINCESS VALERIE
NEVER LEFT THE PALACE.

27:23.843 --> 27:26.345
HER REAL MOTHER KEPT HER
HIDDEN AWAY

27:26.345 --> 27:28.978
SO NO ONE WOULD TAKE HER.

27:31.150 --> 27:34.023
AND THEY WERE
NEVER SEPARATED...

27:34.023 --> 27:35.985
EVER AGAIN.

27:38.087 --> 27:40.259
(door opens)
 (clears throat)

27:40.259 --> 27:44.033
I KNOW I'M NOT SLEEPING
IN HERE TONIGHT.

27:44.033 --> 27:45.795
TONIGHT? (scoffs)

27:45.795 --> 27:47.867
(sighs) LOOK...

27:49.869 --> 27:53.342
I AM UNBELIEVABLY SORRY
ABOUT THIS.

27:53.342 --> 27:58.277
I-I WANTED TO TELL YOU
SO MANY TIMES, BUT...

27:58.277 --> 28:01.981
I-I COULD NEVER FIND
THE RIGHT MOMENT. IT...

28:01.981 --> 28:03.983
REALLY?

28:03.983 --> 28:05.985
IN 20 YEARS OF MARRIAGE,

28:05.985 --> 28:08.287
THERE WAS NEVER A LULL
IN THE CONVERSATION

28:08.287 --> 28:11.961
FOR YOU TO SAY,
"HEY, GUESS WHO I SLEPT WITH"?

28:13.993 --> 28:16.996
WHEN WOULD HAVE BEEN
A GOOD TIME?

28:16.996 --> 28:19.298
THE DAY I FOUND OUT
YOU WERE PREGNANT

28:19.298 --> 28:22.001
WITH PORTER AND PRESTON?

28:22.001 --> 28:23.702
PARKER'S 1st BIRTHDAY PARTY?

28:23.702 --> 28:26.305
THE MORNING THAT
PENNY TOOK HER FIRST STEPS?

28:29.739 --> 28:32.481
WE HAVE HAD...

28:32.481 --> 28:34.143
SUCH BEAUTIFUL MOMENTS
TOGETHER.

28:34.143 --> 28:36.986
I-I DIDN'T WANNA RUIN
A SINGLE ONE OF THEM.

28:41.050 --> 28:45.024
(sighs)

28:45.024 --> 28:49.328
I HOPE YOU CAN
FORGIVE ME FOR THIS.

28:53.963 --> 28:55.965
IT WOULD BE A SHAME...

28:57.867 --> 29:00.970
A SHAME IF SOME MEANINGLESS
ENCOUNTER 20 YEARS AGO

29:00.970 --> 29:06.345
RUINED THIS WONDERFUL LIFE
THAT WE HAVE BUILT TOGETHER.

29:33.302 --> 29:34.904
SUSAN.

29:34.904 --> 29:38.077
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T CALL FIRST.
YOU'RE NOT BUSY, ARE YOU?

29:38.077 --> 29:42.781
I'M JUST PACKING. UH,
MY CAB'S GONNA BE HERE SOON.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.955
SO... Y-YOU HAVE TIME
TO TALK?

29:47.086 --> 29:49.188
SURE.

29:52.521 --> 29:54.363
I, UM...

29:54.363 --> 29:56.365
WELL, I JUST...

29:56.365 --> 29:59.568
WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
FOR YESTERDAY.

29:59.568 --> 30:02.972
OH. NO NEED.

30:02.972 --> 30:05.975
THIS IS... A HORRIBLE TIME
FOR YOU,

30:05.975 --> 30:08.077
AND YOU'VE GOT SO MUCH
ON YOUR MIND.

30:08.077 --> 30:10.079
IT'S--
IT'S NOT THAT HORRIBLE,

30:10.079 --> 30:13.042
AND THE DOCTORS
ARE VERY OPTIMISTIC

30:13.042 --> 30:15.044
THAT WE'RE GOING TO FIND
A DONOR.

30:15.044 --> 30:16.345
I'M NOT WORRIED.

30:16.345 --> 30:20.389
OH. I'M SO RELIEVED.

30:20.389 --> 30:22.151
(sighs)

30:28.297 --> 30:30.299
YOU KNOW
WHAT THE ONE GOOD THING

30:30.299 --> 30:33.462
ABOUT HAVING
A HEALTH SCARE IS?

30:33.462 --> 30:36.465
NO. WHAT?

30:36.465 --> 30:40.910
MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT
THE IMPORTANT THINGS ARE.

30:43.572 --> 30:45.414
THAT'S VERY TRUE.

30:48.077 --> 30:51.080
WE ALL THINK THAT WE'RE...
GONNA BE HERE FOREVER,

30:51.080 --> 30:54.954
THAT WE HAVE...
ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD

30:54.954 --> 30:58.257
TO SAY THE IMPORTANT THINGS,
BUT WE DON'T.

31:01.931 --> 31:05.995
WHY DON'T YOU AND I EVER
TELL EACH OTHER HOW WE FEEL?

31:05.995 --> 31:10.039
WE DON'T NEED TO.

31:10.039 --> 31:11.971
WE KNOW HOW WE FEEL.

31:11.971 --> 31:14.944
(whispers) DO WE?

31:18.978 --> 31:20.950
(normal voice) YOU'RE RIGHT.

31:22.281 --> 31:26.585
YOU ALREADY KNOW
HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU.

31:26.585 --> 31:30.219
AND YOU ALREADY KNOW

31:30.219 --> 31:32.221
THAT ANYTIME
I ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING,

31:32.221 --> 31:34.223
YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON
I WANNA CALL,

31:34.223 --> 31:36.996
'CAUSE I LOVE
 MAKING YOU PROUD.

31:36.996 --> 31:39.898
AND YOU KNOW THAT...

31:39.898 --> 31:43.402
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
YOU MAKE ME CRAZY...

31:45.404 --> 31:48.907
PART OF ME ENJOYS IT
BECAUSE IT REMINDS ME

31:48.907 --> 31:52.081
THAT NOBODY ELSE
HAS A MOM LIKE YOU.

31:54.083 --> 31:55.914
YEAH.

31:55.914 --> 31:58.387
I DON'T HAVE
TO TELL YOU THAT.

32:00.549 --> 32:04.393
JUST LIKE I DON'T NEED
TO TELL YOU

32:04.393 --> 32:08.958
THAT MY LIFE BEGAN
THE DAY YOU WERE BORN.

32:12.161 --> 32:16.705
AND IT'S BEEN SUCH
A HAPPY ONE.

32:16.705 --> 32:18.607
(sighs)

32:20.269 --> 32:23.442
AREN'T WE LUCKY
WE ALREADY KNOW THOSE THINGS?

32:23.442 --> 32:28.317
(telephone rings)

32:28.317 --> 32:30.379
(sniffles)

32:30.379 --> 32:33.022
YES?

32:33.022 --> 32:34.984
YES. I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

32:34.984 --> 32:37.056
IT'S MY CAB.

32:38.957 --> 32:42.731
YOU GO, AND I, UH...

32:42.731 --> 32:45.034
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

32:45.034 --> 32:46.965
OKAY.

32:50.369 --> 32:53.072
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THESE DAYS,
I WOULD--

32:53.072 --> 32:56.075
I WOULD LIKE FOR US
TO TAKE A LITTLE TRIP,

32:56.075 --> 32:58.077
JUST THE TWO OF US.

32:58.077 --> 33:00.749
OH, I'D LIKE THAT.

33:00.749 --> 33:02.751
YOU KNOW,
WE'LL GO SOMEPLACE HOT

33:02.751 --> 33:06.255
AND JUST LAY OUT
AND DRINK SOME DAIQUIRIS.

33:06.255 --> 33:10.719
OH, WE'LL... ABSOLUTELY
DO THAT. (chuckles)

33:10.719 --> 33:15.494
JUST AS SOON AS I'M DONE
WITH MY CRUISE.

33:19.668 --> 33:21.370
YEAH.

33:25.674 --> 33:28.307
NO OFFENSE, PENNY,
BUT SOCCER'S BORING.

33:28.307 --> 33:30.239
YEAH, IT'S AS BORING AS...

33:30.239 --> 33:33.142
ACTUALLY, THERE'S NOTHING
MORE BORING.
 (Preston) YOU CAN TELL US
ABOUT IT LATER.

33:33.142 --> 33:36.045
BUT YOU HAVE TO GO.
IT'S A PLAYOFF GAME.

33:36.045 --> 33:39.588
THEY'RE THE BEST TEAM IN
THE LEAGUE. I NEED YOUR SUPPORT.

33:39.588 --> 33:42.351
(Porter) OH, WHO CARES?
YOU GUYS SUCK ANYWAY.
 (Preston) YEAH, THEY MAY SUCK,

33:42.351 --> 33:45.054
BUT THEY STILL WOULD'VE
BEATEN PARKER'S TEAM.
 HEY, PRESTON, UH,

33:45.054 --> 33:48.697
HOW DID THE BASEBALL TEAM
DO SENIOR YEAR?
 SHUT UP. AT LEAST I PLAYED.

33:48.697 --> 33:50.199
OH. (laughs) THAT'S TRUE.

33:50.199 --> 33:52.431
REMEMBER THAT TIME
HE STRUCK OUT FIVE TIMES?

33:52.431 --> 33:55.734
(Preston) BY THE THIRD TIME,
THE CROWD STARTED LAUGHING.

33:55.734 --> 33:57.406
(Parker)
YEAH, THAT WAS HILARIOUS.

33:57.406 --> 34:00.409
YOUR LAST AT-BAT, THE OTHER
TEAM SAT ON THEIR MITTS.

34:00.409 --> 34:03.472
(Parker)
OH, SO EMBARRASSING.
 SHAMEFUL.

34:03.472 --> 34:06.775
COME ON, YOU GUYS. PLEASE?

34:06.775 --> 34:08.777
I GOT STUFF TO DO.
 (chuckles) LIKE WHAT?

34:08.777 --> 34:12.351
STARE IN THE MIRROR AND WAIT
FOR THE FIRST MUSTACHE HAIR?

34:12.351 --> 34:15.424
(laughter)
 (Preston) RELAX, PENNY.
AT LEAST YOU WON'T

34:15.424 --> 34:18.427
HAVE TO SHARE YOUR SNACKS
WITH US AFTER THE GAME.

34:18.427 --> 34:22.231
OKAY, FINE. DON'T GO.

34:22.231 --> 34:24.533
WE'RE JUST MESSING
WITH YOU.

34:24.533 --> 34:25.764
WE'RE GOING.

34:27.366 --> 34:29.768
THANK YOU.
 YEAH.

34:29.768 --> 34:32.601
(Porter) I'M EVEN GONNA DRIVE
YOU, BUT I'M GONNA WARN YOU,

34:32.601 --> 34:34.773
IF YOU LOSE,
YOU'RE WALKING HOME.

34:34.773 --> 34:36.275
(Penny) OH, PLEASE.

34:36.275 --> 34:38.777
YEAH. I'M NOT DRIVING LOSERS
IN MY CAR.

34:38.777 --> 34:41.280
(Parker) DOES THAT MEAN
YOU'RE NOT TAKING PRESTON?

34:41.280 --> 34:42.311
(Penny chuckles)

34:45.313 --> 34:48.786
HERE YOU GO, LADIES.
 WOW.

34:48.786 --> 34:51.489
OH, BREE, THAT LOOKS AMAZING.
THANK YOU SO MUCH

34:51.489 --> 34:54.393
FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER.
IT REALLY FEELS LIKE OLD TIMES.

34:54.393 --> 34:56.395
WELL, YOU HAVE BEEN
THROUGH SO MUCH,

34:56.395 --> 34:58.767
AND I WANTED YOU
TO FEEL LOVED AND EMBRACED

34:58.767 --> 35:00.769
BY ALL THE PEOPLE
IN THIS ROOM.

35:00.769 --> 35:03.402
AND WHILE I'M ON THE TOPIC
OF EMBRACING PEOPLE,

35:03.402 --> 35:06.535
I HAVE INVITED OUR NEIGHBOR BETH
TO JOIN US. CHEESE PUFF, ANYONE?

35:07.736 --> 35:09.608
BETH YOUNG?

35:09.608 --> 35:12.741
MARRIED TO PAUL YOUNG?
 THE LADY WITH THE BAD HAIR?

35:12.741 --> 35:15.314
OH, FORGET THE HAIR!
HER HUSBAND CAUSED THE RIOT.

35:15.314 --> 35:17.516
WHICH CAUSED SUSAN
A KIDNEY.

35:17.516 --> 35:20.118
WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS, BREE?

35:20.118 --> 35:23.121
I JUST FELT SORRY FOR HER.
THE POOR WOMAN HAS BEEN SHUNNED

35:23.121 --> 35:24.653
BY EVERYONE
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

35:24.653 --> 35:26.495
BECAUSE SHE'S MARRIED
TO A MONSTER.

35:26.495 --> 35:28.497
SO?
WHY SHOULD SHE HAVE TO SUFFER

35:28.497 --> 35:30.659
FOR THE SINS OF HER HUSBAND?

35:30.659 --> 35:33.802
OH, CRAP. SHE'S BEEN
TALKING TO A PRIEST.

35:33.802 --> 35:36.805
RENEE, HELP US OUT.
TELL HER SHE'S CRAZY.

35:36.805 --> 35:39.468
UH, ACTUALLY,
I'M WITH BREE.

35:39.468 --> 35:42.140
PLEASE, YOU'VE NEVER
GIVEN BETH A CHANCE,

35:42.140 --> 35:45.714
AND SPEAKING AS
THE OTHER NEW KID ON THE BLOCK,

35:45.714 --> 35:48.217
YOU GUYS ARE LIKE
THE MEAN, PRETTY GIRLS

35:48.217 --> 35:51.220
WHO WON'T LET ANYONE
SIT AT YOUR LUNCH TABLE.

35:51.220 --> 35:54.483
THAT IS SO UNFAIR. (scoffs)
WHO INVITED HER?

35:54.483 --> 35:55.754
(doorbell rings)

35:55.754 --> 35:57.256
(gasps)
OKAY, THAT'S BETH.

35:57.256 --> 36:01.190
NOW, PLEASE, LADIES,
MAKE AN EFFORT FOR ME.

36:01.190 --> 36:02.691
I'M ACTUALLY EXCITED.

36:02.691 --> 36:05.864
I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE
ONE OF THE MEAN, PRETTY GIRLS.

36:05.864 --> 36:08.297
(ice cubes rattling)

36:08.297 --> 36:11.500
YEAH, I GOT A DELIVERY
FOR VAN DE KAMP.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.802
OOH, HOW LOVELY.

36:13.802 --> 36:16.545
I DON'T SEE A CARD.
WHO ARE THEY FROM?

36:16.545 --> 36:18.307
UH, BEATS ME.

36:18.307 --> 36:19.848
MUST BE MY BOYFRIEND.

36:19.848 --> 36:24.213
WOULD YOU MIND SETTING THEM
OVER THERE? I'LL GO GET A TIP.

36:24.213 --> 36:27.356
IS IT HER, OR CAN I WIPE
THIS FAKE SMILE OFF MY FACE?

36:27.356 --> 36:30.188
IT'S A DELIVERYMAN.
SOMEONE SENT ME FLOWERS.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.591
WAS IT THE POPE?

36:34.423 --> 36:37.796
HERE YOU GO. THANK YOU.

36:39.828 --> 36:41.500
OH, GOOD! YOU MADE IT.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.201
HELLO.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.704
LADIES, BETH'S HERE!

36:45.704 --> 36:49.308
YOU'RE SURE THIS IS OKAY?
IT ISN'T GONNA BE AWKWARD?

36:49.308 --> 36:51.780
OF COURSE NOT! THE GIRLS
ARE DELIGHTED YOU'RE HERE.

36:51.780 --> 36:56.715
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE
A WONDERFUL TIME.

36:59.988 --> 37:02.791
(clock ticking in distance)

37:02.791 --> 37:06.525
THAT IS A REALLY GOOD DEAL
ON POTTING SOIL.

37:06.525 --> 37:08.226
YES.

37:10.399 --> 37:12.861
WELL, AGAIN, I HAD A COUPON.

37:14.763 --> 37:16.635
THAT IS FORTUNATE.

37:27.416 --> 37:30.749
MAYBE I SHOULD GO--
 NO, NO, THE EVENING
HAS JUST GOTTEN STARTED.

37:30.749 --> 37:33.452
I'M GONNA NEED SOME HELP
IN THE KITCHEN--

37:33.452 --> 37:36.325
YOU, YOU, YOU, AND YOU.
NOW.

37:39.688 --> 37:40.989
BY THE WAY,

37:40.989 --> 37:43.932
I KNOW SOMEBODY WHO CAN REALLY
HELP YOU WITH THAT HAIR.

37:43.932 --> 37:45.634
(Bree) RENEE!

37:48.737 --> 37:51.039
(lowered voice)
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?

37:51.039 --> 37:53.742
YOU SAID YOU'D MAKE AN EFFORT.
 I AM MAKING AN EFFORT--

37:53.742 --> 37:56.044
AN EFFORT NOT TO TEAR OUT
MY DEFORMED KIDNEY

37:56.044 --> 37:59.047
AND CRAM IT DOWN HER THROAT.
 YEAH, SO BETH'S FEELING
A LITTLE LONELY THESE DAYS.

37:59.047 --> 38:01.810
WHY IS IT OUR RESPONSIBILITY
TO MAKE HER FEEL LOVED?

38:01.810 --> 38:04.513
OKAY, LOOK, I DIDN'T WANNA
BRING THIS UP,

38:04.513 --> 38:06.515
BUT LET'S TALK
ABOUT THE LAST WOMAN

38:06.515 --> 38:08.517
WHO WAS MARRIED TO PAUL YOUNG--

38:08.517 --> 38:11.520
A WOMAN WHO WAS IN PAIN,
AND WE IGNORED IT.

38:11.520 --> 38:14.523
DO WE REALLY WANT BETH
TO END UP LIKE MARY ALICE?

38:14.523 --> 38:16.365
(sighs)

38:16.365 --> 38:19.428
(Bree) WE'RE BACK.

38:19.428 --> 38:21.730
WE'VE DECIDED TO KICK
THIS PARTY UP A NOTCH.

38:21.730 --> 38:23.732
OH. (chuckles nervously)
LOVELY.

38:23.732 --> 38:26.805
YEAH. SIT HERE.
WE'LL POUR YOU SOME VINO.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.006
THANK YOU.

38:28.006 --> 38:30.709
IS RED OKAY?
BECAUSE WE HAVE WHITE, TOO.

38:30.709 --> 38:36.685
UH, NO, RED IS FINE.
WHAT IN THE WORLD?

38:36.685 --> 38:38.717
(gasps)

38:38.717 --> 38:40.649
SOMEBODY LOSE A GUN?

38:53.402 --> 38:55.804
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT IS THAT DOING THERE?

38:55.804 --> 38:57.335
BREE?

38:57.335 --> 39:00.769
NO, I KEEP ALL MY WEAPONS
IN A LOCKER. LET ME SEE THAT.

39:02.671 --> 39:04.743
IT'S A .38 CALIBER.

39:04.743 --> 39:09.748
THE POLICE SAID...
PAUL WAS SHOT WITH A .38.

39:15.954 --> 39:19.558
I THINK I FINALLY UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU INVITED ME OVER.

39:19.558 --> 39:21.860
MEANING?

39:21.860 --> 39:24.963
I'M JUST THINKING
HOW CONVENIENT IT IS--

39:24.963 --> 39:27.896
A GUN THAT MAY HAVE BEEN
USED TO SHOOT PAUL

39:27.896 --> 39:29.598
WAS UNDER MY PILLOW?

39:29.598 --> 39:31.970
A-AND NOW HAS
MY FINGERPRINTS ON IT?
 (gun clatters)

39:31.970 --> 39:34.973
HEY, I WAS SITTING THERE
BEFORE YOU WERE,

39:34.973 --> 39:37.005
AND I DIDN'T FEEL ANY GUN.

39:37.005 --> 39:39.708
YEAH, SPEAKING OF CONVENIENT...
 (sets glass down)

39:39.708 --> 39:41.710
YOU'RE ALONE IN THE ROOM,
WE CAME BACK,

39:41.710 --> 39:44.713
AND SUDDENLY THERE'S A GUN
UNDER THE CUSHION?
 WHERE WOULD I GET A GUN?

39:44.713 --> 39:46.585
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

39:46.585 --> 39:50.619
HOW ABOUT THE ONE YOU POINTED
AT ME ON HALLOWEEN NIGHT?
 YOU NEVER TOLD US THAT.

39:50.619 --> 39:53.592
YOU MEAN THE NIGHT
YOU BROKE INTO MY HOUSE

39:53.592 --> 39:56.595
AND TRIED TO KILL MY HUSBAND
WITH A CLUB?
 YOU NEVER TOLD US THAT,
EITHER.

39:56.595 --> 39:58.597
I'M ALLOWED TO HAVE
A PRIVATE LIFE.

39:58.597 --> 40:01.600
THE POINT IS, SHE OWNS
A GUN JUST LIKE THE ONE

40:01.600 --> 40:07.135
THAT MAGICALLY APPEARED
WHEN SHE WAS ALONE IN THE ROOM.

40:11.510 --> 40:14.643
YOU'RE ALL IN ON THIS.

40:14.643 --> 40:16.845
YOU WANTED TO SET ME UP.

40:16.845 --> 40:19.848
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
WOULD SAY TO THAT TO ME

40:19.848 --> 40:22.190
AFTER I REACHED OUT TO YOU.

40:22.190 --> 40:27.055
WELL, I THINK IT'S TIME I DID
SOME REACHING OUT OF MY OWN.

40:27.055 --> 40:30.599
I'M CALLING THE POLICE.

40:39.738 --> 40:41.740
(sighs)

40:41.740 --> 40:45.443
WE DON'T HAVE TO
GET UP EARLY TOMORROW.

40:45.443 --> 40:48.577
SO I WAS THINKING...
MAYBE WE COULD--

40:48.577 --> 40:53.622
I STILL CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT I FELL FOR BETH'S ACT.

40:53.622 --> 40:56.084
OR WE COULD TALK ABOUT THIS
SOME MORE.

40:56.084 --> 40:59.157
WELL, SHE IS JUST AS TWISTED
AS THAT HUSBAND OF HERS,

40:59.157 --> 41:01.830
AND I AM A FOOL.

41:01.830 --> 41:03.532
YOU'RE NOT A FOOL.

41:03.532 --> 41:05.534
YOU'RE A KIND
AND GENEROUS PERSON.

41:05.534 --> 41:08.767
THAT'S WHAT I LOVE
ABOUT YOU.

41:08.767 --> 41:11.940
THAT AND THE FACT
THAT YOU CAN GO FROM...

41:11.940 --> 41:16.845
MAD TO PASSIONATE
IN A HEARTBEAT.

41:19.578 --> 41:22.210
I SUPPOSE YOU DO DESERVE
SOME LOVING...

41:22.210 --> 41:23.852
MMM.
 MMM.

41:23.852 --> 41:26.855
AFTER THOSE
BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS YOU SENT ME.

41:26.855 --> 41:28.857
(sighs)

41:28.857 --> 41:33.622
AT THE RISK OF...
GOING TO BED FRUSTRATED...

41:35.493 --> 41:37.566
I DIDN'T SEND YOU
ANY FLOWERS.

41:37.566 --> 41:41.730
YOU DIDN'T? THEN WHERE
DID THEY COME FROM?

41:47.606 --> 41:50.779
(Mary Alice) WE PASS
BY THESE PEOPLE EVERY DAY,

41:50.779 --> 41:54.042
BUT WE NEVER LOOK AT THEM.

41:54.042 --> 42:00.749
WE DON'T WANNA SEE THE SADNESS
IN THEIR EXPRESSIONS...

42:03.091 --> 42:06.595
THE LONGING IN THEIR HEARTS...

42:09.858 --> 42:13.662
THE LONELINESS IN THEIR EYES...

42:15.864 --> 42:17.535
BUT THERE ARE TIMES

42:17.535 --> 42:22.540
WE SHOULD STOP AND LOOK
AT THESE ISOLATED PEOPLE.

42:22.540 --> 42:25.213
WHY?

42:25.213 --> 42:29.618
WELL,
IF WE LOOK CLOSE ENOUGH...

42:29.618 --> 42:33.722
WE MIGHT JUST RECOGNIZE THEM.
