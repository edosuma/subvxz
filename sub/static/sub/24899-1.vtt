WEBVTT

00:09.679 --> 00:10.539
What's wrong with you, man?

00:10.619 --> 00:13.659
I'm just playing around.
You trying to take a man's head off?

00:13.739 --> 00:15.579
No. You know I get excited, man.
Huh!

00:15.659 --> 00:17.099
Sorry. Am I cool? You cool?

00:17.179 --> 00:18.659
Pff! Yeah. All right.

00:18.739 --> 00:20.419
Calm down, man. Sorry.

00:22.499 --> 00:24.859
Ooh! Argh! What you saying?

00:24.939 --> 00:25.939
Oh? What?

00:26.019 --> 00:27.099
You showing off now?

00:27.179 --> 00:28.659
I was just playing, innit?

00:35.059 --> 00:36.659
Hey, it's gone, man.

00:36.739 --> 00:38.059
What?

00:38.139 --> 00:39.619
Your hair. Your hair.

00:39.699 --> 00:42.179
Listen. Concentrate on
how much cakes you're eating.

00:42.259 --> 00:44.939
Don't worry about my waistline,
my waistline is fine.

00:45.019 --> 00:47.619
Don't worry about my hairline,
the light's just catching it.

00:51.299 --> 00:54.179
Oh, brother, I've gotta go.
I'm gonna be late for the ceremony.

00:54.259 --> 00:55.899
In a bit!
What do you want later?

00:55.979 --> 00:57.139
Chicken or lamb?

00:58.739 --> 01:00.139
You can imagine, as deputy,

01:00.219 --> 01:03.379
I generally get the jobs the mayor
can't be bothered to do.

01:03.459 --> 01:07.339
But today, I'm actually giving
an award I'm honoured to give.

01:09.059 --> 01:13.459
I've been privileged to know him
since I first joined the force.

01:15.019 --> 01:16.939
He's one of the
first black police

01:16.952 --> 01:18.939
officers to receive
a commendation.

01:22.379 --> 01:23.579
Sorry.

01:23.659 --> 01:26.019
And now, he is a recipient of

01:26.099 --> 01:30.179
the Mayor's Award for
Distinguished Service to the Met.

01:30.259 --> 01:33.019
The Director General of the NCA,

01:33.099 --> 01:34.259
Ronald Pike.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:45.179 --> 01:46.379
I'm sorry.

01:46.459 --> 01:49.259
Shiny, Dad. It's shiny.

01:55.059 --> 01:56.459
What?

01:56.539 --> 01:58.059
Ah, there you are. Chicken or lamb?

01:58.139 --> 02:00.139
'Fish! This is not a good time
right now.'

02:00.219 --> 02:01.659
It's never a good time for you.

02:01.739 --> 02:03.579
You're upset that
you didn't get invited.

02:03.659 --> 02:04.899
'Oh, why? Where are you?'

02:04.979 --> 02:08.339
You are so childish, bruv.
I'm getting the lamb.

02:08.419 --> 02:09.619
No red meat in my house.

02:09.699 --> 02:12.019
I'll get chicken. Or pork?
Is that red meat or white meat?

02:12.099 --> 02:15.179
As long as it's free range.
'Jesus! You and this free range.'

02:15.259 --> 02:17.979
The only difference between normal
and free range is

02:18.059 --> 02:20.219
Hold on one sec.
Sabine's calling me.

02:23.339 --> 02:26.059
Hey, hold up, man.
Sabine's trying to call me too.

02:26.139 --> 02:27.099
Hello?

02:27.179 --> 02:30.739
'Bishop.
I need to see you. Now.'

02:30.819 --> 02:33.899
'Someone found out I talked to you
and I'm really scared.'

02:33.979 --> 02:36.099
I'll grab you at the usual place.

02:36.179 --> 02:38.939
You need to come and get me.
She sounds scared.

02:39.019 --> 02:40.939
I can't just walk out of here.
'You can.'

02:41.019 --> 02:42.779
Your dad won't care.
I'm getting chicken.

03:31.939 --> 03:34.459
I'm surprised they let a black man
in there, to be honest.

03:34.539 --> 03:39.379
It's amazing what you can do
with a nice suit, bro. Get me.

03:39.459 --> 03:41.259
You want a mint, bruv?

03:41.339 --> 03:43.174
Mouth smells like
you've been drinking

03:43.187 --> 03:44.939
champagne or eating
something mad...

03:45.019 --> 03:49.299
Nothing wrong with my
breath. What are you talking about?

03:49.379 --> 03:52.059
It's bad enough. Take a mint.
I don't want a mint!

03:52.899 --> 03:55.939
Sabine, recent. You all right?
I told you everything I knew.

03:56.019 --> 03:57.699
And now I'm getting threats.

04:02.179 --> 04:04.099
Is the number familiar?
Of course not.

04:04.179 --> 04:06.339
Otherwise I wouldn't be worried.

04:06.459 --> 04:08.499
You promised you'd look after me
if I helped you.

04:08.579 --> 04:10.859
We're here, aren't we?
I tell you what you do.

04:10.939 --> 04:12.859
Send me the number,
I'll put a trace on it.

04:12.939 --> 04:15.539
Put me in a safe-house
or I stop talking.

04:15.619 --> 04:18.059
That is impossible
off the back of a text. Come on.

04:18.139 --> 04:19.738
Not good enough, Bishop.

04:19.819 --> 04:21.779
I've got valuable information.

04:21.858 --> 04:23.699
A gang stealing cars.

04:23.779 --> 04:26.259
Dangerous people.
You got an address?

04:27.059 --> 04:28.379
You get nothing until I get safe.

04:28.459 --> 04:31.779
All right, let me make a call and
we'll try and pull some strings.

04:31.859 --> 04:34.499
"Pull some strings"? That's it?

04:35.499 --> 04:38.459
I thought I meant more to you.
Sabine!

04:38.539 --> 04:40.299
Sabine, don't just walk off
like that!

04:40.379 --> 04:42.579
Bruv, why are they so angry?
Is that a thing?

04:42.659 --> 04:45.179
Yeah, it's an Eastern European...
They're angry people.

04:45.259 --> 04:47.019
They say black people are angry.
Nuts.

04:47.099 --> 04:48.539
We're not angry people.

04:49.859 --> 04:51.699
Yo, yo! Get in the car!

04:56.499 --> 04:58.019
No, no, no, no, no.

04:58.099 --> 05:00.219
Urgent medical to
Fort Road Industrial Estate.

05:00.299 --> 05:03.859
IC1. Sabine Grosch. In pursuit of
a red Audi estate, reg to follow.

05:05.259 --> 05:08.299
You! You! Stay with her!
Stay with her!

05:16.779 --> 05:17.859
Fuck, man, Sabine!

05:17.939 --> 05:21.939
Lima, Kilo, 58,

05:22.019 --> 05:23.699
Delta, Yankee, Juliet.

05:23.779 --> 05:26.179
It's going very fucking fast!
Very fucking fast.

05:30.579 --> 05:32.019
Jesus! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

05:32.099 --> 05:33.659
Hey! Hey!

05:33.739 --> 05:35.579
Pike, what the hell
is wrong with you?

05:35.659 --> 05:37.059
Put your seat belt on. It's on!

05:37.139 --> 05:39.499
Drive the car properly!
I got this! Chill, man.

05:41.019 --> 05:42.299
Yo!

05:43.059 --> 05:44.379
Oh, shit!

05:45.059 --> 05:46.499
Left! Left!

05:50.499 --> 05:51.939
Whoa! Whoa. Whoa!

05:52.019 --> 05:54.659
Aargh!

05:55.779 --> 05:56.979
Whoops.

05:59.699 --> 06:02.739
Bruv, drive carefully.
You gotta sort that out, mate.

06:02.819 --> 06:05.019
Concentrate on the road, man.
I am concentrating.

06:05.099 --> 06:07.579
You're a fucking policeman
and you're scared of driving!

06:07.659 --> 06:11.419
I'm scared of reckless driving!
All right. Whatever, man. Shut up.

06:11.499 --> 06:13.939
Yeehaa!

06:14.019 --> 06:16.139
Whoa, Jesus!

06:22.259 --> 06:24.899
You know what?
This guy's good, you know.

06:26.499 --> 06:29.379
Whoops! There goes your

06:31.699 --> 06:34.539
All right, let's see what you got.

06:36.499 --> 06:39.499
There! There! There!

06:40.379 --> 06:44.019
This guy's mine!

06:52.659 --> 06:55.699
Whoa!

07:02.012 --> 07:04.252
I don't like you, you know.

07:04.332 --> 07:05.812
Brother, I just saved your life.

07:07.252 --> 07:09.132
I still don't like you. Never have.

07:09.212 --> 07:11.572
Fair dues.

07:22.332 --> 07:23.812
Sabine, man.

07:29.185 --> 07:32.945
Oh, shit. Tanner's here, bro.

07:34.545 --> 07:36.585
Come on. There you go.

07:39.385 --> 07:41.945
What is that?
It's a dog, Bishop.

07:42.025 --> 07:44.265
I'm old and I'm lonely.
It's what happens.

07:47.185 --> 07:48.665
Any next of kin?

07:48.745 --> 07:51.225
Left them under the rubble
in Srebrenica.

07:51.305 --> 07:53.305
Came here for a better life.

07:53.385 --> 07:55.625
Was she good as a grass?

07:55.705 --> 07:57.385
We've been grooming her for months.

07:57.465 --> 08:00.065
She was a good woman.
Just wanted to do the right thing.

08:00.145 --> 08:01.665
She was an informant, Pike.

08:01.745 --> 08:04.785
She was our informer.
Hardly an exclusive business.

08:04.865 --> 08:06.745
Run her phone
and stop being sentimental.

08:07.945 --> 08:09.145
Yes, ma'am.

08:15.785 --> 08:17.225
That'll teach you.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.825
Oi, put your hand down, man.
You wouldn't do that to her face.

08:20.905 --> 08:23.065
Neither would you. True.

08:25.465 --> 08:28.065
How we getting back?

08:28.145 --> 08:29.585
Hey, Plod! Keys!

08:34.465 --> 08:38.865
Bro, what are you doing?
It's gone and it ain't coming back.

08:41.385 --> 08:42.945
I saw it, Bish.

08:43.025 --> 08:44.105
Saw what?

08:44.184 --> 08:46.705
The mirror under the keyboard.
Busted.

08:50.945 --> 08:52.973
Er, Nell, Sabine Grosch's phone.
If you're

08:52.986 --> 08:55.025
heading to Tech, can
you run it up for me?

08:55.105 --> 08:57.305
And why would I run
your errands for you?

08:58.145 --> 09:01.825
Because, under that hard exterior,
you secretly like me

09:01.905 --> 09:04.945
and this would be a great way of
connecting with me. Nice.

09:05.025 --> 09:07.385
God, I feel sorry
for your whatever she is.

09:09.585 --> 09:12.025
I must say, you do have a way
with the ladies.

09:18.745 --> 09:20.345
Yes.

09:27.345 --> 09:29.425
That's my way of
connecting with you.

09:29.505 --> 09:30.905
Oh, man.

09:32.785 --> 09:34.665
That's your fault.
You dropped the shot.

09:34.745 --> 09:37.625
Bollocks, that was you!
You did, man. I don't drop shots.

09:37.705 --> 09:39.385
You dropped it. No, I did not.

09:39.465 --> 09:42.425
Nice shooting, Jonesy. I would
trust you in the line of fire.

09:42.505 --> 09:43.785
That was me, actually.

09:44.905 --> 09:46.625
Nice shooting, Jonesy.
Such a dick.

09:46.705 --> 09:48.985
It was her, actually.
But for what it's worth,

09:49.065 --> 09:50.705
I'd trust you in the line of fire
as well.

09:50.785 --> 09:53.465
Thank you.
Good luck with that, mate.

09:53.545 --> 09:56.825
Sorry to hear about your informant.
It sounded terrible.

09:56.905 --> 09:59.145
You should've seen it, man.
It was messed up.

09:59.225 --> 10:02.465
You got a bead on her?
Forensics are running the phone.

10:05.545 --> 10:07.785
To Sabine. Mmm.

10:07.865 --> 10:09.985
Nah, to the ones that killed her.

10:10.065 --> 10:11.225
We're coming for you.

10:15.065 --> 10:16.505
Replacement car time, boys.

10:16.585 --> 10:18.865
You've got to be joking.
Seriously?

10:18.945 --> 10:19.905
Go on.

10:24.305 --> 10:25.785
What you sayin?

10:32.785 --> 10:34.865
Argh.

10:34.945 --> 10:38.585
This is your fault,
you know. I blame you for this.

10:38.665 --> 10:40.425
I'm sorry. What can I say?

10:41.625 --> 10:43.625
That wasn't a sincere apology.
Yes, it was.

10:43.705 --> 10:45.425
I can tell.
I know when you're sincere.

10:45.505 --> 10:47.985
That wasn't sincere.
I meant sorry. Sorry.

10:48.065 --> 10:50.185
You didn't mean it, though, did you?

10:56.305 --> 10:59.225
Mate, you actually charged her
to live here, yeah?

10:59.305 --> 11:01.905
No one forced her.

11:01.985 --> 11:03.345
Open the door before I slap you.

11:17.545 --> 11:19.785
Looks like she was studying
Engineering, bro.

11:22.945 --> 11:26.225
Someone's roughed this place up.
No way she lived like this.

11:26.305 --> 11:27.625
Yeah.

11:32.545 --> 11:33.945
Yeah? Yeah.

11:42.065 --> 11:43.745
Oh, my God.

11:43.825 --> 11:45.065
Shit, man.

11:46.585 --> 11:48.225
Hey.

11:48.305 --> 11:50.425
Yo, Jonesy. 'Yeah, mate?'

11:50.505 --> 11:53.025
We're gonna need Forensics
down here.

11:53.105 --> 11:55.985
Social Services as well.
'No worries. Roger that.'

11:59.425 --> 12:01.505
Why didn't she tell us
about the baby, man?

12:01.585 --> 12:04.785
We could have done something.
I don't know, bruv.

12:04.865 --> 12:06.905
Maybe she didn't want us
getting too close.

12:26.265 --> 12:29.145
'The victim of a fatal
hit-and-run in East London'

12:29.225 --> 12:31.785
'has been named as Sabine Grosch.'

12:31.865 --> 12:34.133
'The 28-year-old
Serbian national was

12:34.146 --> 12:36.425
struck and killed
on Friday morning.'

12:36.505 --> 12:39.705
'The police have yet to release
an official statement...'

12:41.785 --> 12:44.165
'The 28-year-old woman
from Serbia was

12:44.178 --> 12:46.385
killed in a hit-and-run
yesterday.'

12:46.465 --> 12:48.264
'Police are yet to
comment but there

12:48.277 --> 12:50.185
could be a connection
to local gangs.'

12:50.265 --> 12:52.665
Bish. Have you seen the time?

12:52.745 --> 12:54.865
Oh. You could have tidied up.

12:54.945 --> 12:57.185
I'll get round to it.
Please don't make us late.

12:57.265 --> 12:59.840
It reflects badly on me.
No, darling, it reflects

12:59.853 --> 13:02.025
badly on us. It was
you who wanted to go.

13:09.825 --> 13:11.721
Why don't you rub
chilli flakes into

13:11.734 --> 13:13.745
the meat? Gives it a
really nice kick.

13:13.825 --> 13:15.585
Babe, I know what I'm doing, yeah?

13:17.545 --> 13:19.385
OK. Thank you.

13:23.865 --> 13:25.865
- I saw that.
- Oh, my God.

13:25.945 --> 13:27.705
Only because I love you.

13:31.185 --> 13:34.265
Can you get the door?
I AM getting the door, babe.

13:44.505 --> 13:46.905
No Jehovah's Witnesses, thank you.

13:46.985 --> 13:48.825
Mm.

13:48.905 --> 13:50.665
Aargh!

13:56.905 --> 13:57.905
Yeah?

13:57.985 --> 13:59.825
Well, if you expect me
to act like an adult...

13:59.905 --> 14:02.505
Give her a drop. Go on.
Just a little.

14:02.585 --> 14:04.785
Cheers. There you go. Cheers.

14:04.865 --> 14:07.550
For what we are about
to receive, may

14:07.563 --> 14:09.905
the Lord make us truly grateful.

14:10.945 --> 14:14.705
Blessed are we, in fellowship

14:14.785 --> 14:17.465
and friendship and family.

14:18.985 --> 14:21.785
Mm, this bird is delicious
got such a good kick to it.

14:21.865 --> 14:23.025
Thank you.

14:25.705 --> 14:28.985
Of course I'll run. Who wouldn't
want to be Mayor of London?

14:29.065 --> 14:30.905
As long as there's perks
for your godson.

14:30.985 --> 14:34.625
Thank you.
Thanks for inviting me.

14:34.705 --> 14:36.825
That's all right. You're family.
Mwah!

14:42.665 --> 14:44.865
I used to play piano.
I used to play piano.

14:52.065 --> 14:55.345
Dad. Dad! Dad, come on, man. Dad!

14:55.425 --> 14:56.585
I know what I'm doing, son.

14:56.665 --> 15:00.585
Hey. We're just gonna have an
Edinburgh reunion at Pizza Express.

15:00.665 --> 15:01.825
Sounds good. Yeah.

15:01.905 --> 15:03.865
You taking him? Mm-mm.

15:03.945 --> 15:06.385
Just the girls. OK.

15:07.705 --> 15:10.225
No, no, no.
Don't worry, I'll keep it short.

15:10.305 --> 15:11.665
Please do.

15:11.745 --> 15:14.785
But family congregations
deserve gratitude.

15:14.865 --> 15:21.025
And know that I count everyone
in this room as family.

15:22.225 --> 15:25.665
Now, what brain in my flock

15:25.745 --> 15:28.985
knows the meaning of "ad pudenda"?

15:29.065 --> 15:31.105
Oh, here we go.

16:15.985 --> 16:18.065
Yo. Yo, man.

16:18.145 --> 16:21.105
Tanner just called. Tech ran
Sabine's phone they got a postcode.

16:23.825 --> 16:25.665
Get ready, yeah?

16:29.265 --> 16:32.465
I swear, when this guy's had a drink,
he chats shit, you know.

16:32.545 --> 16:36.465
Seriously, all I want to do
is catch criminals. You get me?

16:36.545 --> 16:39.625
I don't know why he has to start
talking in that wannabe posh accent.

16:41.025 --> 16:42.625
Bruv, are you even listening?

16:44.385 --> 16:45.945
Yeah, man.

16:54.065 --> 16:55.585
Liven up, Bish.

16:55.665 --> 16:57.274
If these are the
people Sabine was on

16:57.287 --> 16:58.865
about, they don't
fuck around, bruv.

17:03.825 --> 17:05.025
Oi.

17:08.744 --> 17:10.704
What is it, my cooking?

17:10.785 --> 17:12.025
Hm? What you chatting about?

17:12.105 --> 17:13.744
You've been acting weird
since lunch.

17:16.065 --> 17:17.345
I'm just being thoughtful.

17:18.065 --> 17:20.785
You? Thoughtful, yeah? Are you ill?

17:21.944 --> 17:23.425
What do you mean, am I ill?

17:25.224 --> 17:27.545
Is this the one?
Yeah. Don't think anyone's home.

17:27.625 --> 17:29.585
Fancy a look inside?
Yeah, why not?

17:30.945 --> 17:33.345
Be careful, yeah?

17:33.425 --> 17:34.945
I'm good, man.

17:41.945 --> 17:44.465
Car keys, Bish. Sabine was right.

17:48.225 --> 17:50.825
Yeah. Mate.

17:50.905 --> 17:54.225
Programming key fobs.
These guys are serious, bro.

17:54.305 --> 17:56.105
Let me see if I can crack into this.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.465
Shit, shit.

18:56.345 --> 18:58.665
Bish, we need to move.

20:00.945 --> 20:02.025
Go, grab him!

20:03.105 --> 20:04.305
- Argh!
- What?

20:05.385 --> 20:06.825
Argh!

20:17.425 --> 20:19.225
Hup!

20:19.305 --> 20:20.905
Hey!

20:20.985 --> 20:23.225
Urgh! There you go.

20:23.305 --> 20:24.825
Shit!

20:27.305 --> 20:29.105
Where you going?

20:29.185 --> 20:31.345
Just cuff him. I'm calling it in.

20:31.425 --> 20:32.625
Yeah.

20:32.705 --> 20:35.025
You're nicked, mate. Let's go.

20:41.985 --> 20:44.225
You know Sabine was a mother, right?

20:46.145 --> 20:48.185
Now that child's gonna be
brought up in care.

20:55.745 --> 20:56.785
No comment.

21:06.225 --> 21:07.585
Maybe you're the father.

21:08.585 --> 21:10.305
That your style, is it?

21:10.385 --> 21:11.945
Murder your child's mother?

21:19.225 --> 21:21.025
No comment. Shut up, man!

21:22.865 --> 21:24.985
The cars. Where are they going?

21:26.705 --> 21:28.305
Trying to ship 'em out the country?

21:29.585 --> 21:31.745
I tell you what,
it's not gonna happen.

21:31.825 --> 21:33.185
Not on my fucking watch.

21:57.765 --> 22:00.205
Connection to Sabine Grosch?

22:00.285 --> 22:01.965
He killed her, that's all.

22:03.045 --> 22:04.885
Any evidence to back that up?

22:06.165 --> 22:09.085
Asked for a solicitor
other than that interpreter?

22:09.165 --> 22:11.845
He hasn't said...
Cos he doesn't fucking need one!

22:11.925 --> 22:14.565
Anything recovered from that flat
is inadmissible.

22:14.645 --> 22:17.605
There's things called warrants,
you know papery with words on.

22:20.485 --> 22:22.525
Right, well.
We're gonna have to let him go.

22:24.685 --> 22:27.365
Unless you've, er,
got any smart ideas?

22:32.305 --> 22:35.385
Nice arrest, boys!
Heard you're letting him go? Classy.

22:35.465 --> 22:37.185
Hey, bruv,
I'll slap you in your mouth.

22:37.265 --> 22:39.705
Easy, I'm just kidding.
Jonesy, you think I'm joking?

22:39.785 --> 22:41.305
Calm down, Bishop.
What are you doing?

22:41.385 --> 22:44.945
Learn to take a joke, mate.
What's up?

22:45.025 --> 22:47.425
He just gets on my damn nerves.

22:59.025 --> 23:00.425
That's illegal, you know?

23:01.545 --> 23:03.625
So is murder.

23:22.705 --> 23:24.785
Yo. What?

23:26.505 --> 23:29.065
What you doin?

23:29.145 --> 23:31.945
Got a location. Come on, then.

23:47.265 --> 23:48.465
So?

23:51.945 --> 23:53.345
I said, "So?"

23:59.145 --> 24:01.825
I know I shouldn't have, man,
but I checked Sophie's phone.

24:03.665 --> 24:05.825
That's a no-win there, bruv.

24:05.905 --> 24:07.505
You're telling me.

24:09.425 --> 24:10.705
She's sexting with Jonesy.

24:12.025 --> 24:13.425
What?

24:13.505 --> 24:15.385
Hold on. Our Jonesy?
Yeah, our Jonesy.

24:15.465 --> 24:17.025
Is that why you jumped him, bro?

24:21.185 --> 24:23.985
What am I gonna do, Pike?
Do you actually know it's him?

24:24.065 --> 24:26.025
Bruv, I can read, you know!

24:26.105 --> 24:28.625
"It was good to see you."
"I can't wait to see you again."

24:28.705 --> 24:30.865
All right, man. All right. Look.

24:30.945 --> 24:32.945
Don't just go jumping to conclusions,
yeah,

24:33.025 --> 24:35.385
and do something stupid
before you know for certain.

24:35.465 --> 24:37.825
You know how you get sometimes.
What do you mean?

24:37.905 --> 24:40.145
You get all vexed, and then...
When do I get vexed?

24:40.225 --> 24:43.505
Pushing up your chest
and nose flaring, eyes wide...

24:43.585 --> 24:45.545
Ever seen my nose flare?
You're doing it now!

24:45.625 --> 24:48.585
I don't get vexed, bruv!
All right.

24:50.105 --> 24:51.385
Oh, shit.

24:51.465 --> 24:53.385
Lively.

24:53.465 --> 24:54.945
Right, Bish, Bish, Bish.

24:55.025 --> 24:57.265
Are you seeing this?

24:58.105 --> 25:00.225
Bish! Uh. Focus man, come on!

25:02.825 --> 25:04.825
Oh, yeah, Lamborghini Huracan.

25:05.745 --> 25:07.385
Mercedes SLS.

25:07.465 --> 25:09.145
Mercedes G-Wagon 63.

25:12.225 --> 25:13.825
Oh, shit, there's the red Audi.

25:16.065 --> 25:19.305
No, no, no, no. Bruv, no,
we're not going in there blazing.

25:19.385 --> 25:22.625
But we owe it to Sabine, man.
We can't just steam in, bro.

25:22.705 --> 25:25.345
This is not about getting revenge
to make us all feel better.

25:26.585 --> 25:27.625
Bish.

25:27.705 --> 25:31.065
Don't let the way you feel now
cloud your judgment, yeah?

25:31.145 --> 25:32.105
Please.

25:32.185 --> 25:35.745
Yeah? OK, bro.

25:35.825 --> 25:38.385
We're gonna need 24-hour observation
down here.

25:39.665 --> 25:42.905
Which one of you idiots
wants to take the first shift?

25:42.985 --> 25:44.425
'Yeah, fuck it, why not?'

25:46.145 --> 25:48.225
Yeah, I thought you would,
you dirty stop-out.

25:48.305 --> 25:51.385
And make it snappy.
I've got a date with my wife.

26:04.785 --> 26:06.625
Please?

26:06.705 --> 26:08.265
Babe, can't I just relax
for a minute?

26:08.345 --> 26:10.745
I'll return the favour.

26:10.825 --> 26:13.185
Oh! OK.

26:13.265 --> 26:14.985
All right.

26:15.065 --> 26:16.705
Dad? Out!

26:19.105 --> 26:20.945
Gotta get a lock on that door, baby.

26:23.185 --> 26:26.385
So... this partnership.

26:26.465 --> 26:28.425
I think I'm gonna say no.

26:28.505 --> 26:30.403
We don't use that
word in this house.

26:30.416 --> 26:32.225
It's too much pressure.
Long hours.

26:32.305 --> 26:34.378
And what about the girls?
It'll be a

26:34.391 --> 26:36.305
big change, Ronnie,
and for what?

26:36.385 --> 26:38.185
For your career.

26:38.265 --> 26:40.905
You wanted to go back when
the little one went to big school.

26:40.985 --> 26:42.345
That was different. Out!

26:42.425 --> 26:43.905
My iPad froze! I don't care!

26:43.985 --> 26:45.985
I can't find my hearing aid!
I said, get out!

26:48.305 --> 26:50.825
Sorry. Why's it different?

26:50.905 --> 26:54.105
It's a bit of a number.
Oh, so is unfulfilled potential.

26:55.145 --> 26:56.505
All right, look.

26:56.585 --> 26:58.905
- All I'm saying is don't rule it out.
- Yeah.

26:59.945 --> 27:02.065
How's that feel?

27:02.145 --> 27:04.185
Like I'm about to return the favour.

27:04.265 --> 27:05.465
Oh, yeah?

27:05.545 --> 27:07.105
But not without a lock on the door.

27:09.545 --> 27:12.185
Huh. Rub your own foot, then.
Hey.

27:26.265 --> 27:27.465
Bish?

27:38.505 --> 27:41.505
It's the, er...
It's the one you like, with a kick.

27:42.865 --> 27:44.345
Bish.

27:45.385 --> 27:46.985
Oh, I wish you'd told me.

27:47.065 --> 27:49.985
Well, well, I wanted to, er...

27:50.065 --> 27:51.905
I wanted to surprise you,
so, you know...

27:54.585 --> 27:59.105
Oh, I'm supposed to be going out.
I told you a while back.

27:59.185 --> 28:02.025
Edinburgh reunion with the girls
at Pizza Express.

28:03.025 --> 28:04.785
Yeah, you did, actually.

28:04.865 --> 28:07.145
You did actually tell me that.
I just forgot.

28:07.225 --> 28:10.705
Know what? That sounds like a lot of
fun. You should go to that, man.

28:10.785 --> 28:13.225
They're gonna wanna catch up.
If I make it in time.

28:13.305 --> 28:15.024
Jonesy's coming from
Paris and at this

28:15.037 --> 28:16.545
rate, she'll get
there before me.

28:17.745 --> 28:19.225
She? Jonesy?

28:19.305 --> 28:23.425
Yeah, Fiona Jones. The Welsh flirt.

28:23.505 --> 28:24.745
You remember her.

28:26.785 --> 28:31.145
Fiona Jones. Fiona Jones!

28:31.225 --> 28:34.065
Fiona Jones, yes.
What? What's so funny?

28:34.145 --> 28:36.065
Man. Do you know what?

28:36.145 --> 28:38.425
Fiona, yeah, Fiona.
Don't even worry about it.

28:38.505 --> 28:40.506
You wouldn't believe
me if I told you. You

28:40.519 --> 28:42.625
need to get out of the
scrubs, go get ready.

28:42.705 --> 28:46.465
What about all this?
I'll eat all of it. Just... Just go.

28:46.545 --> 28:48.465
Just go, go, go, go. Shoo.

28:48.545 --> 28:51.025
Shoo. This'll be waiting for you
when you get home.

28:51.105 --> 28:53.305
OK. And this.

28:53.385 --> 28:55.185
Yeah. Go on, Bishop.

29:03.825 --> 29:05.825
You're starting to like that car,
aren't you?

29:05.905 --> 29:08.585
Come on, man.

29:08.665 --> 29:11.825
You pussy. I knew it.
I was right, innit? I told you.

29:11.905 --> 29:14.265
Yeah, yeah. Crying. Crying.

29:14.345 --> 29:17.585
"My girl. My girl. My girl."
Come on.

29:17.665 --> 29:20.225
It's not Jonesy, Jonesy.
But I'm, er...

29:20.305 --> 29:22.145
I'm too embarrassed to talk about it.

29:22.225 --> 29:24.145
I hear you.

29:24.225 --> 29:27.305
I know we're going onto the motorway.
But don't drive too fast, man.

29:27.385 --> 29:28.665
Oh, bruv, come on.

29:37.065 --> 29:39.225
Sasa Dragenev. Serbian.

29:39.305 --> 29:41.016
Somewhere towards
the top of a chain

29:41.029 --> 29:42.705
of a gang stealing
and transporting

29:42.785 --> 29:46.065
high-end cars to the Continent.
We haven't got long.

29:46.145 --> 29:48.825
We found the cars and think
they'll want to move them soon.

29:48.905 --> 29:50.745
We believe he killed Sabine Grosch,

29:50.825 --> 29:52.745
an informer who was
about to turn him in.

29:52.825 --> 29:56.265
You've all seen the pictures of
what he did to her. Nice boy, eh?

29:56.345 --> 29:57.665
Bishop?

29:58.705 --> 30:00.505
Check your maps.

30:00.585 --> 30:03.345
There's one road out of there,
so when they leave, that's it.

30:03.425 --> 30:07.105
We'll track the cars to where they're
shipping them from and move in.

30:07.185 --> 30:10.105
I want this gang caught,
so to be clear...

30:10.185 --> 30:11.905
they do not leave this country.

30:11.985 --> 30:14.705
And we get Sasa off the street.
Clear?

30:15.585 --> 30:16.825
Crystal.

30:19.225 --> 30:22.665
'Yeah, that sounds great, Bishop,
but when are we getting relieved?'

30:22.745 --> 30:25.225
'We've been here for hours.
I can't feel my legs.'

30:25.305 --> 30:28.945
Glad you've woken up, Jonesy.
Team en route. Is Nell OK?

30:29.025 --> 30:31.705
'Bit bored, ma'am.'
'Oh, thanks, mate.'

30:31.785 --> 30:35.025
"Good partner, eh?'

30:35.105 --> 30:37.065
All right. Well, let's get into it.

30:37.145 --> 30:39.705
She's not funny. I don't know
why she tries to make jokes.

30:39.785 --> 30:41.985
Let me talk to you, bro.
Yeah, man.

30:42.065 --> 30:44.425
You need to apologise to him,
you know. To Jonesy.

30:45.585 --> 30:48.785
What for? Look, man,
I'm not gonna do it here

30:48.865 --> 30:50.905
on a video link in front of
everyone, am I?

30:50.985 --> 30:53.305
Yeah, I'm not saying now,
but you have to do it.

30:58.305 --> 31:01.305
Fuck, we've been made! Move it!
Move, move!

31:01.385 --> 31:03.665
Look lively! Come on!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

31:13.865 --> 31:15.465
The tracker's on, ma'am.

31:15.545 --> 31:17.905
We've located Dragenev
and we're right behind him.

31:21.465 --> 31:22.985
Shit.

31:25.505 --> 31:27.625
Approaching target up ahead.

31:27.705 --> 31:30.545
'Keep your distance.
I don't want them spooked. Munroe?'

31:30.625 --> 31:33.705
Officers are gone,
Warehouse has been abandoned.

31:33.785 --> 31:36.105
Fuck. Shit.

31:36.185 --> 31:39.745
Listen in. Number one priority,
get Jones and Nell back,

31:39.825 --> 31:41.345
whatever, however.

31:48.945 --> 31:51.705
Ma'am, we're stuck in traffic,
but we can see the Audi.

31:51.785 --> 31:53.625
We just can't get to it
because of road works.

31:53.705 --> 31:56.505
'Number of occupants?'
Two occupants.

31:56.585 --> 31:59.025
No sign of Nell and Jonesy.

31:59.105 --> 32:01.785
'Keep your eyes on them
until I send a back-up team.'

32:01.865 --> 32:03.545
'Do not get out of that car.'

32:13.985 --> 32:15.785
Stay in your car.
What's going on?

32:23.345 --> 32:25.985
Don't move! Don't move, bro!

32:26.065 --> 32:28.025
Finger off the trigger
and put the gun down.

32:29.545 --> 32:31.945
Take your finger off the trigger
and stay cool.

32:32.025 --> 32:33.465
Bish? Yeah?

32:34.465 --> 32:36.505
They can't speak English, bro.
How do you know?

32:36.585 --> 32:38.465
They're not speaking English, mate!

32:42.825 --> 32:45.225
Hey, Bish. Yo.

32:45.305 --> 32:48.065
Put your gun down, bro.
Show them.

32:48.145 --> 32:49.585
What? No way! You put yours down.

32:49.665 --> 32:51.385
Just put your gun down, bro.
Show them.

32:51.465 --> 32:53.025
No way, man. You put yours down.

32:53.105 --> 32:55.545
You really wanna do this now?
You put yours down.

32:55.625 --> 32:58.305
I'm not putting my gun down.
Come on, man.

32:58.385 --> 32:59.825
Come on.

33:03.025 --> 33:05.825
All right, it's going down, yeah?
Nice and slow.

33:05.905 --> 33:08.785
Come on, slowly, slowly.
There you go.

33:08.865 --> 33:11.745
Do like my friend, come on. Come on.

33:11.825 --> 33:12.945
Come on.

33:14.985 --> 33:16.625
Give me the gun, man.

33:16.705 --> 33:18.585
Keep your hands up.

33:18.665 --> 33:21.865
Bruv, I will give you another dimple.
Give me the gun!

33:21.945 --> 33:23.265
Bruv, are you deaf?

33:23.345 --> 33:25.225
I don't even know
what you're playing at.

33:25.305 --> 33:26.865
Fuck!

33:30.305 --> 33:33.105
Come on!
You all right? Get in the car!

33:38.865 --> 33:41.545
All right?
I think I got shot, you know.

33:41.625 --> 33:45.425
What are you saying? You dying?
No, it's just my jumper.

33:45.505 --> 33:48.345
You ain't fucking been shot, then!
It clipped me. It hurts!

33:48.425 --> 33:49.905
Slow down, man.

33:54.705 --> 33:57.185
We are in pursuit
of that red fucking Audi again.

34:12.344 --> 34:14.065
Jesus!

34:14.145 --> 34:15.985
Whoa!

34:17.166 --> 34:19.446
Shoot the tyres, bro.

34:31.726 --> 34:33.126
Come here.

34:37.806 --> 34:39.005
Yeah, that's for Sabine.

34:39.085 --> 34:40.926
Hey! Get us out!

34:41.005 --> 34:42.166
And that's for Sabine.

34:42.246 --> 34:44.286
Jones has been shot.
Untie me, quick.

34:44.366 --> 34:46.485
Keep still. Keep still.
Jones has been shot!

34:49.525 --> 34:52.366
Argh!

34:53.726 --> 34:55.126
Someone call for medic!

34:58.326 --> 35:00.646
Bishop, not your fault.
Now, get it together.

35:03.166 --> 35:05.526
Keep it down. Focus.
You're gonna be all right.

35:05.606 --> 35:07.606
Come on, bro, we gotta go.

35:10.966 --> 35:13.526
Ma'am, the satnav says
we're heading to the docks.

35:13.606 --> 35:16.286
We've taken Sasa's car,
see if we can surprise them.

35:16.366 --> 35:18.766
- Hopefully we're not too late.
- 'Roger that.'

35:18.846 --> 35:22.126
You're on the job, brother.
This shit happens.

35:22.206 --> 35:24.246
For the sake of the unit,
and for mostly me,

35:24.326 --> 35:26.806
get a fucking grip of yourself.
Come on, Bish!

35:26.886 --> 35:29.366
Think of Sabine, man. OK.

35:29.446 --> 35:30.966
You good? Yeah. Good.

35:31.046 --> 35:35.006
When Jonesy comes around, yeah,
he ain't gonna blame you.

35:35.086 --> 35:37.166
Let's go and do what we need to do.

35:37.246 --> 35:38.886
Sort this shit out right now.

35:39.886 --> 35:41.726
Let's go finish this, bro.

36:13.886 --> 36:16.846
You ready, Bish?
I'll take Captain Birdseye, yeah?

36:19.086 --> 36:20.646
Where the fuck is Sasa?

36:20.726 --> 36:22.588
Sorry, man. I could
have sworn this

36:22.601 --> 36:24.526
was the House of
Wings Chicken Shop.

36:24.606 --> 36:26.926
You know how us black people
love chicken, man.

36:29.046 --> 36:31.486
Yargh!

36:35.446 --> 36:38.446
Argh!

36:41.366 --> 36:43.726
Oh, shit. Get off!

36:44.326 --> 36:45.726
Argh! Ugh!

36:45.806 --> 36:47.486
Bish! Bish! Bish! Come on.

36:49.006 --> 36:51.526
You made hard work of that.
You picked the small one. Shut up.

37:02.006 --> 37:03.526
Go.

37:11.046 --> 37:14.446
Hello, hello, hello. You're all
under arrest for auto smuggling.

37:14.526 --> 37:17.886
Shut it down. Shut the gate.
Nothing leaves the dock.

37:21.766 --> 37:23.206
Switch it off.

37:23.286 --> 37:26.646
Good lad.

37:26.726 --> 37:30.846
See you later, lads.

37:30.926 --> 37:32.846
Enjoy your time.

37:32.926 --> 37:34.726
I hear the view's nice at Belmarsh.

37:45.646 --> 37:47.806
Listen, stop fretting.
It's all good.

37:51.286 --> 37:52.966
Ma'am, any news on Jonesy?
Is he OK?

37:53.766 --> 37:56.686
They're operating on him now.
The bullet just missed an artery.

37:57.726 --> 37:59.606
But so far everything looks good.

38:00.646 --> 38:03.206
It's all right, man.

38:03.286 --> 38:05.246
Go home and rest. You deserve it.

38:07.286 --> 38:09.326
Home. All right.

38:12.206 --> 38:14.726
Come on, man.

38:14.806 --> 38:16.366
Eh, eh, eh!

38:16.446 --> 38:17.886
Cheers.

38:20.646 --> 38:24.566
Go on, put a burger on for me, bro.
I'm fucking dying out here, man.

38:24.646 --> 38:26.086
I didn't think you ate red meat,
Pike?

38:26.166 --> 38:27.886
It's organic, innit?

38:31.806 --> 38:34.726
OK, listen.
I would like to propose...

38:34.806 --> 38:36.326
Propose to who? Me?

38:36.406 --> 38:38.686
I got a wife, bruv, I don't want you.
Are you sure?

38:38.766 --> 38:40.406
Fuck. Of course. No.

38:40.486 --> 38:44.046
I would like to propose a toast...
to Jonesy.

38:44.126 --> 38:45.966
Cos I know he'll pull through.

38:46.046 --> 38:47.566
Yeah, man. Jonesy. Jonesy.

38:47.646 --> 38:48.886
Cheers.

38:50.926 --> 38:52.486
To Jonesy.

38:52.566 --> 38:54.766
Next time you go out with Bishop,

38:54.846 --> 38:56.846
make sure you wear a fucking vest!

38:56.926 --> 39:00.046
Yes!

39:00.126 --> 39:02.086
Yeah. That's not funny, bro.

39:02.166 --> 39:04.526
What's wrong?
It's not funny. That's not funny.

39:04.606 --> 39:07.406
All right.
Yeah, exactly. It was all right.

39:09.486 --> 39:12.006
I've heard better jokes! You...

39:12.086 --> 39:14.326
You're no fucking Ken Dodd, are you?

39:14.406 --> 39:16.330
Go on, brother, top that up.
Come on,

39:16.343 --> 39:18.126
bruv! Where's the
fucking burgers?

39:18.206 --> 39:20.686
It's coming!
I can't smell nothing cooking, man!

39:20.766 --> 39:22.846
Get that peanut oil burning, bruv.

39:23.966 --> 39:27.046
Now, wait. You freaky motherfucker.

40:52.166 --> 40:55.846
Michael Sharp. British citizen
but holds a Dutch passport.

40:55.926 --> 40:58.326
Just cleared customs at Stansted
an hour ago.

40:58.406 --> 40:59.766
This is the guy.

40:59.846 --> 41:01.966
After you, man. Thanks.

41:07.166 --> 41:10.166
Well, this isn't good.
Double tap hits.

41:10.246 --> 41:13.726
Armed robbery, two dead bodies, and
we can't sew this thing together?

41:13.806 --> 41:15.286
The man slept with my girl.

41:15.366 --> 41:17.446
I love you, bro, but don't
be around when I see him.

41:17.526 --> 41:18.566
Go! Go! Go!

41:18.646 --> 41:20.166
Go on!

41:20.246 --> 41:22.446
I say we blast in there and grab him.

41:25.406 --> 41:27.446
You obviously thought that one
through.

41:27.526 --> 41:29.966
You got a better idea? No.
