WEBVTT

00:02.586 --> 00:05.708
Were you imprisoned in Russia
on charges of espionage?

00:05.816 --> 00:06.475
Yes.

00:08.221 --> 00:11.589
Did you sustain any injuries
during your imprisonment in Russia?

00:12.210 --> 00:14.159
Yes.

00:14.160 --> 00:17.061
Were your injuries a result of torture?

00:19.431 --> 00:20.832
Yes.

00:20.833 --> 00:22.841
Do you resent the
United States government

00:22.842 --> 00:25.809
for its role in your incarceration?

00:26.544 --> 00:28.379
Sometimes.

00:28.380 --> 00:30.215
Do you plan to subvert or sabotage

00:30.216 --> 00:31.549
the U.S. government?

00:31.550 --> 00:33.084
No.

00:33.085 --> 00:34.919
We have recruits with a lot less baggage.

00:34.920 --> 00:38.123
We would be allowing a former
member of the Russian military

00:38.124 --> 00:42.694
into the highest levels of the agency.

00:42.695 --> 00:45.063
I need you to be clear-eyed on this.

00:45.064 --> 00:47.198
That it's not some kind
of penance on your part

00:47.199 --> 00:48.933
- for leaving him in a Gulag.
- It's not.

00:48.934 --> 00:51.769
But you'll be fully accountable for him.

00:51.770 --> 00:54.339
You know, you're running
a division of the CIA

00:54.340 --> 00:57.041
that involves our most sensitive work,

00:57.042 --> 00:58.843
and you're five minutes on the job.

00:58.844 --> 01:00.678
Then I must think he's pretty valuable.

01:00.679 --> 01:04.015
Have you ever been convicted of a felony?

01:04.016 --> 01:05.917
This process isn't exactly reliable

01:05.918 --> 01:08.052
with a guy like this.
We'll see how he does here.

01:08.053 --> 01:10.754
I'll have an answer for you tomorrow.

01:16.428 --> 01:17.729
Oh!

01:17.730 --> 01:21.199
One store, two hours, six bags,

01:21.200 --> 01:23.434
everything on the list, shazam.

01:23.435 --> 01:25.737
"Shazam"? Nice. Really bringing it back.

01:25.738 --> 01:27.739
I love Bed Bath & Beyond.

01:27.740 --> 01:29.040
Yes, you do.

01:29.041 --> 01:30.341
Because they have everything.

01:30.342 --> 01:32.243
They have things you
didn't even know you wanted,

01:32.244 --> 01:35.547
and that, my friend, is where
the "Beyond" part kicks in.

01:35.548 --> 01:38.416
Uh, like a ceramic hedgehog
that's really a shoe scraper?

01:38.417 --> 01:40.552
You know, you are so gonna use that.

01:40.553 --> 01:42.554
Wait and see, I'm telling you.

01:42.555 --> 01:44.756
Probably more than the turbo

01:44.757 --> 01:46.157
wet/dry hand vac.

01:46.158 --> 01:49.394
What? No, no, no, that is a must have.

01:49.395 --> 01:51.696
We're not going to be
slaughtering our own food.

01:51.697 --> 01:53.331
How messy can we be?

01:53.332 --> 01:55.833
Well, you would be surprised.

01:55.834 --> 01:57.702
Please. It's just gonna
take up closet space.

01:57.703 --> 01:59.337
Why don't you keep it here?

01:59.338 --> 02:01.839
We already have two.
Upstairs, downstairs.

02:01.840 --> 02:05.076
Ah, the familiar rustle
of capitalism at work.

02:05.077 --> 02:06.277
We got everything.

02:06.278 --> 02:08.645
Operation Ali Goes to
College is completo.

02:08.646 --> 02:11.182
Except, you know, the going to college.

02:11.183 --> 02:13.017
In two days. I can't believe it.

02:13.018 --> 02:15.853
And I can't believe that I'm not
gonna be able to take you, Ali.

02:15.854 --> 02:17.655
It's okay. I think they'd miss

02:17.656 --> 02:20.925
the secretary of state at the
United Nations General Assembly.

02:20.926 --> 02:22.660
Dad and I will be fine.

02:22.661 --> 02:24.462
Oh, no. You didn't.

02:24.463 --> 02:26.864
Mom. The wet/dry vac?

02:26.865 --> 02:29.234
You loved yours.

02:29.235 --> 02:30.568
I sold it,

02:30.569 --> 02:31.936
the second week of school.

02:31.937 --> 02:32.971
You did?

02:32.972 --> 02:34.606
Also, I never sorted my laundry.

02:34.607 --> 02:36.908
Okay? I just put it all
in the washing machine,

02:36.909 --> 02:38.943
- on cold water.
- Please stop.

02:38.944 --> 02:40.345
Okay. Show of hands.

02:40.346 --> 02:42.513
Who thinks a game room would
benefit the whole family?

02:42.514 --> 02:45.016
I'm only going an hour away.
You're not taking over my room.

02:45.017 --> 02:46.317
Guard it for me, will you?

02:46.318 --> 02:50.221
Uh, sorry, I'm going to
New York tomorrow, so...

02:50.222 --> 02:51.389
You're going to UNGA, too?

02:51.390 --> 02:52.724
Yes, in my capacity as

02:52.725 --> 02:55.093
the White House chief
of staff's silent intern.

02:55.094 --> 02:57.395
Russell says that I'm not
allowed to talk to anyone.

02:57.396 --> 02:59.264
Yeah, he says that to me a lot, too.

02:59.265 --> 03:00.498
Can you guys give me a hand?

03:00.499 --> 03:01.833
- I have to start packing.
- Oh.

03:01.834 --> 03:04.235
Packing for college!

03:04.236 --> 03:05.403
Can you believe it?

03:05.404 --> 03:06.971
Yes, Mom, we can all believe it.

03:06.972 --> 03:08.606
Well, I can't.

03:09.975 --> 03:12.710
It would still be your room,
just with an air hockey table.

03:12.711 --> 03:13.911
Forget it.

03:13.912 --> 03:16.648
What about a... pool table, maybe?

03:16.649 --> 03:19.082
Whose side are you on?

03:20.852 --> 03:22.620
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

03:22.621 --> 03:24.555
The new one is cordless!

03:24.556 --> 03:25.990
It's just... Ha!

03:25.991 --> 03:28.526
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
charge it up for you.

03:28.527 --> 03:30.828
'Cause you are gonna use it.

03:30.829 --> 03:32.764
We need to get a hobby.

03:32.765 --> 03:33.931
Mm-hmm.

03:33.932 --> 03:36.034
Something that we can do together.

03:36.035 --> 03:39.804
You know? Like... golf or... tennis

03:39.805 --> 03:41.673
or maybe a book club.

03:41.674 --> 03:43.608
Totally.

03:43.609 --> 03:45.076
I'm serious.

03:45.077 --> 03:49.047
We are two years away from
having a completely empty nest,

03:49.048 --> 03:51.683
and we are not prepared.

03:51.684 --> 03:53.351
We could turn into that couple

03:53.352 --> 03:55.420
that doesn't know how
to talk to each other.

03:55.421 --> 03:58.923
We'll start watching TV
shows we don't care about.

03:58.924 --> 04:00.858
Stop going to restaurants
'cause they're too loud.

04:00.859 --> 04:02.794
Stop going to movies 'cause of parking.

04:02.795 --> 04:05.263
And from there, it is
just a race to the bathtub

04:05.264 --> 04:06.497
that opens from the side.

04:06.498 --> 04:09.133
Stop feeling guilty.

04:09.134 --> 04:10.329
That is not it.

04:10.330 --> 04:12.340
Technically, Stevie still lives with us.

04:12.341 --> 04:14.439
There's an excellent chance
Jason will never leave.

04:15.607 --> 04:17.942
I don't think empty nest
is gonna be our problem.

04:17.942 --> 04:22.546
Or maybe you just know how much
better I am at golf and tennis.

04:25.283 --> 04:28.086
I will slay you at book club.

04:28.087 --> 04:29.387
That's true.

04:29.388 --> 04:30.722
I feel guilty.

04:30.723 --> 04:31.823
Stop it.

04:31.824 --> 04:33.391
You couldn't take Stevie to college.

04:33.392 --> 04:34.959
- I know.
- Remember? You had the flu?

04:34.960 --> 04:36.828
And look what happened; she dropped out.

04:36.829 --> 04:38.730
And then she finished,
and now she's an intern

04:38.731 --> 04:41.432
- for the White House chief of staff, so...
- It's a watershed event.

04:41.433 --> 04:46.604
It is a life moment, and
it is just passing me by.

04:46.605 --> 04:48.873
Do I sound whiny?

04:48.874 --> 04:52.677
But in a way that I
find totally attractive.

04:52.678 --> 04:56.481
After the reception breakfast,
you have a bilateral meeting

04:56.482 --> 04:57.582
with Foreign Minister Chen.

04:57.583 --> 04:59.081
Then the free speech resolution

04:59.082 --> 05:00.284
takes up most of tomorrow.

05:00.285 --> 05:02.387
That's definitely gonna
dominate the agenda, ma'am.

05:02.388 --> 05:03.821
Not to mention the news cycle.

05:03.822 --> 05:05.256
Getting China to the table

05:05.257 --> 05:07.125
on a multilateral accord
promoting greater free speech...

05:07.126 --> 05:09.260
"Is a foreign policy achievement

05:09.261 --> 05:10.271
"that will open up China

05:10.272 --> 05:12.419
"to the same political
and economic transparency

05:12.420 --> 05:14.132
we've come to expect
from our Western allies."

05:14.133 --> 05:15.166
Boom.

05:15.167 --> 05:16.901
- Thanks, Matt.
- Daisy's got you booked

05:16.902 --> 05:18.936
on the cable news circuit, prime time,

05:18.937 --> 05:23.207
with the anchors you like,
except for... Marty Hawk,

05:23.208 --> 05:24.475
which couldn't avoid.

05:24.476 --> 05:26.844
Oh, Marty.

05:26.845 --> 05:29.981
Well, maybe I'll get a chance
to finish some of the sentences

05:29.982 --> 05:32.183
I didn't get to the
last time I was there.

05:33.285 --> 05:34.619
He's the highest-rated interrupter

05:34.620 --> 05:36.621
- on cable, ma'am.
- I understand.

05:36.622 --> 05:38.501
Oh, also, ma'am, your
brother Will asked me

05:38.502 --> 05:40.164
to remind you that
he'll be attending UNGA

05:40.165 --> 05:42.960
as a guest speaker promoting
cholera vaccinations

05:42.961 --> 05:44.395
in Third World countries.

05:44.396 --> 05:46.664
And you're having lunch
with him at the Four Seasons.

05:46.665 --> 05:48.399
Totally remembered that.

05:48.400 --> 05:51.034
Of course you did, ma'am.

05:53.137 --> 05:55.039
Madam Secretary, Rogério Bento

05:55.040 --> 05:56.707
of the Democratic
Republic of Timor-Leste!

05:56.708 --> 05:58.042
Madam Secretary,

05:58.043 --> 06:00.445
Rogério Bento, Assistant Vice
Minister of Foreign Affairs,

06:00.446 --> 06:02.680
- Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste!
- Nice to see you, Mr. Bento.

06:02.681 --> 06:05.016
Mr. Bento, Mr. Bento,
we will get back to you.

06:05.017 --> 06:06.284
- Please, it's urgent!
- Good day, sir.

06:06.285 --> 06:07.718
Please, it's urgent I get a meeting!

06:07.719 --> 06:08.753
Madam Secretary McCord!

06:08.754 --> 06:10.188
Any guesses what that was about?

06:10.189 --> 06:12.323
Something to do with their
maritime dispute with Australia

06:12.324 --> 06:13.724
and the South China Sea?

06:13.725 --> 06:16.494
That's all the secretary
needs is to send a message

06:16.495 --> 06:18.729
to China by meeting with Timor-Leste.

06:18.730 --> 06:20.631
Agreed. Just smile and keep moving.

06:20.632 --> 06:23.901
So this is actually a better idea.

06:23.902 --> 06:25.102
- Hi.
- Hi, baby.

06:25.103 --> 06:26.771
- Excuse me, Mr. Prime Minister.
- Of course.

06:26.772 --> 06:29.106
- This is pretty exciting, huh?
- Yeah.

06:29.107 --> 06:31.242
Have you seen the raspberry strudel?

06:31.243 --> 06:32.977
You have to bodycheck
the Norwegian ambassador.

06:32.978 --> 06:35.279
- Mom. Mom.
- He's, like, parked there.

06:35.280 --> 06:36.547
- Hey.
- Yeah?

06:36.548 --> 06:39.684
Mr. Jackson and the
president need to talk to you.

06:39.685 --> 06:40.785
Oh. Okay.

06:40.786 --> 06:42.420
Uh, get something to eat, okay?

06:42.421 --> 06:44.721
- Mom.
- You have to eat.

06:47.892 --> 06:51.062
China has pulled out of
the free speech resolution.

06:51.063 --> 06:52.964
What? When?

06:52.965 --> 06:55.766
14 minutes ago.

06:55.767 --> 06:57.368
Did they say why?

06:57.369 --> 06:59.670
No public statement, and I couldn't get

06:59.671 --> 07:02.039
President Li's office to return my call.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.075
My best guess is they were never serious

07:04.076 --> 07:05.443
about coming to the table.

07:05.444 --> 07:09.346
Just... wanted to bait and
humiliate us on the world stage.

07:11.549 --> 07:14.185
I have a bilateral
meeting with Minister Chen

07:14.186 --> 07:15.753
scheduled after this.

07:15.754 --> 07:17.788
So maybe you can keep the dialogue alive.

07:17.789 --> 07:20.925
Actually, I was thinking
I just won't show up.

07:20.926 --> 07:22.460
If it is gamesmanship,

07:22.461 --> 07:25.763
then we have to demonstrate
that we're serious.

07:25.764 --> 07:29.066
Instead, I'll take a meeting
with the Assistant Vice Minister

07:29.067 --> 07:31.168
of Foreign Affairs for Timor-Leste.

07:31.169 --> 07:33.104
Why?

07:33.105 --> 07:34.505
He says it's urgent.

07:34.506 --> 07:36.974
I think it's probably
about the maritime law

07:36.975 --> 07:38.743
and the South China Sea.

07:38.744 --> 07:40.111
That matters to China.

07:40.112 --> 07:43.014
Free speech matters to us.

07:43.015 --> 07:45.783
I think President Li will get the point.

07:45.784 --> 07:47.618
Wow.

07:47.619 --> 07:50.821
It's aggressive and at the
same time a little petty.

07:50.822 --> 07:52.056
Works for me.

07:52.057 --> 07:53.724
So we take control of the narrative

07:53.725 --> 07:55.826
and wait for them to make the next move.

07:55.827 --> 07:57.228
Yes, sir.

07:57.229 --> 08:01.399
Give my regards to the Assistant
Vice Minister of Timor-Leste.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.633
I will, sir.

08:05.000 --> 08:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:15.780 --> 08:17.415
You're gonna need this.

08:17.416 --> 08:20.051
I just heard from Director Haymond.

08:20.052 --> 08:22.453
You're in.

08:22.454 --> 08:24.789
Thank you.

08:24.790 --> 08:26.457
But I have to be honest,

08:26.458 --> 08:27.959
the director was a hard sell.

08:27.960 --> 08:29.660
So if there are any second thoughts,

08:29.661 --> 08:31.028
you need to tell me now.

08:31.029 --> 08:33.664
I'm all in.

08:33.664 --> 08:35.965
Good.

08:40.905 --> 08:42.740
Mr. Bento. Elizabeth McCord.

08:42.741 --> 08:44.775
It's very good to meet you officially.

08:44.776 --> 08:47.411
Madam Secretary, thank you
so much for making the time.

08:47.412 --> 08:49.513
- Of course.
- I was surprised to hear from your office,

08:49.514 --> 08:50.615
but-but very pleased.

08:50.616 --> 08:52.516
Um, can I get you something?

08:52.517 --> 08:53.884
Coffee or tea?

08:53.885 --> 08:55.486
Just-just water.

08:55.487 --> 08:57.388
I understand that you had something

08:57.389 --> 08:59.223
of an... an urgent nature

08:59.224 --> 09:00.558
to discuss with me.

09:00.559 --> 09:02.994
And my staff, they
thought it might be about

09:02.995 --> 09:04.729
the situation in the South China Sea.

09:04.730 --> 09:05.930
As you know,

09:05.931 --> 09:08.398
we've had our own
disputes with China over...

09:10.268 --> 09:12.836
Mr. Bento?

09:14.038 --> 09:16.374
Help! Somebody!

09:16.375 --> 09:17.541
What happened, ma'am?!

09:17.542 --> 09:18.842
I don't know!

09:20.144 --> 09:22.613
Oh, my God.

09:22.614 --> 09:24.181
Go get someone!

09:24.182 --> 09:25.682
Matt, go!

09:27.351 --> 09:34.524

09:37.745 --> 09:38.980
- Ma'am.
- Thank you, Blake.

09:38.981 --> 09:40.916
Uh, also, a gentle reminder that

09:40.917 --> 09:42.952
you missed breakfast,
so you haven't eaten.

09:42.953 --> 09:45.054
- Remind me again in an hour, okay?
- Were they able

09:45.055 --> 09:46.465
to determine the cause of death?

09:46.466 --> 09:48.424
No. Not until the autopsy.

09:48.425 --> 09:50.426
The EMT said it looked like

09:50.427 --> 09:52.962
a cardiac episode, possibly an aneurysm.

09:52.963 --> 09:55.131
It's already in the news.
We need to make a statement.

09:55.132 --> 09:56.432
I'll take care of it.

09:56.433 --> 09:57.700
Thanks, Matt.

09:57.701 --> 09:59.835
We should contact the Bento family

09:59.836 --> 10:02.104
so I can extend my personal condolences.

10:02.105 --> 10:04.507
- I'll reach out.
- Thank you.

10:04.508 --> 10:06.776
The president of Timor-Leste

10:06.777 --> 10:08.210
would like to speak with you personally,

10:08.211 --> 10:11.013
so I set up a meeting for
about an hour from now.

10:11.014 --> 10:12.715
Okay. Good.

10:12.716 --> 10:13.949
Ma'am.

10:13.950 --> 10:16.051
I-I'm really... I'm not hungry.

10:16.052 --> 10:18.319
Y-You should just change your outfit.

10:23.192 --> 10:26.595
Right. Okay. Thank you.

10:26.596 --> 10:28.831
Shocking news from the U.N. today.

10:28.832 --> 10:30.132
A foreign official collapsed

10:30.133 --> 10:31.954
and died during a face-to-face meeting

10:31.955 --> 10:33.084
with Secretary of State...

10:33.085 --> 10:33.994
There's more?

10:33.995 --> 10:36.071
Here's the second to last batch.

10:36.072 --> 10:38.240
You have seen the dimensions
of your dorm room, right?

10:38.241 --> 10:41.076
Blame Mom. She's the one that
went nuts in the big box store.

10:42.045 --> 10:43.479
You have 18 pairs of shoes.

10:43.480 --> 10:44.513
You counted my shoes?

10:44.514 --> 10:46.415
Hey, babe. How are you?

10:46.416 --> 10:48.350
I heard about the guy in Timor-Leste.

10:48.351 --> 10:49.685
I was meeting with him.

10:49.686 --> 10:51.353
It happened right in front of me.

10:51.354 --> 10:52.521
Yeah, that's what they said on the news.

10:52.522 --> 10:53.522
A heart attack, apparently?

10:53.523 --> 10:54.890
Oh, I don't know yet.

10:54.891 --> 10:56.659
There's already something on the Internet

10:56.660 --> 10:58.894
about a secret meeting
regarding the South China Sea.

10:58.895 --> 11:00.296
That's why the Chinese pulled out

11:00.297 --> 11:01.530
of the free speech resolution.

11:01.531 --> 11:03.032
Ugh, the Internet.

11:03.033 --> 11:04.200
I know.

11:04.201 --> 11:05.401
But you're okay, right?

11:05.402 --> 11:07.803
Yeah, I'm fine.

11:07.804 --> 11:09.238
How's it going there?

11:09.239 --> 11:10.372
Oh, great.

11:10.373 --> 11:12.775
Just have to engineer Ali's entire life

11:12.776 --> 11:15.044
into the back of an SUV before tomorrow.

11:15.045 --> 11:17.379
He tried to count my shoes.

11:17.380 --> 11:18.447
18 pairs.

11:18.448 --> 11:19.582
You ever counted mine?

11:19.583 --> 11:20.983
- Yes.
- Okay.

11:20.984 --> 11:24.687
The women and shoe thing...
y-you got to let it go.

11:24.688 --> 11:26.088
I've tried.

11:26.089 --> 11:29.058
Let me talk to Ali. I
want to say good-bye again.

11:29.059 --> 11:30.025
Okay.

11:30.026 --> 11:33.429
Mom, we literally can't finish

11:33.430 --> 11:36.131
the soundtrack of Hamilton
before we get there.

11:36.132 --> 11:39.634
Yes, I have the wet/dry vac right here.

11:41.537 --> 11:44.874
I'm so very sorry for your
loss, President Da Silva.

11:44.875 --> 11:47.243
Thank you, Madam Secretary.

11:47.244 --> 11:50.246
Rogério was a long-time
member of my government,

11:50.247 --> 11:52.882
but he was much more than that.

11:52.883 --> 11:55.618
He was a good friend.

11:55.619 --> 11:57.920
We known each other since primary school.

11:57.921 --> 12:01.457
Were you aware of any health problems?

12:01.458 --> 12:06.862
Not really, but he was under a
considerable amount of stress.

12:06.863 --> 12:11.200
See, his daughter Jasmine died
suddenly several months ago...

12:11.201 --> 12:12.601
a car accident.

12:12.602 --> 12:13.769
Terrible tragedy.

12:13.770 --> 12:15.604
That's awful.

12:15.605 --> 12:17.106
She was only 22 years old.

12:17.107 --> 12:18.841
I'm so sorry.

12:18.842 --> 12:21.911
I wonder if you can
tell me, Madam Secretary,

12:21.912 --> 12:25.147
what it was Rogério
wanted to discuss with you.

12:25.148 --> 12:28.250
We didn't get a chance to talk.

12:28.251 --> 12:30.219
I thought you might tell me.

12:30.220 --> 12:32.187
I have no idea.

12:32.188 --> 12:34.857
I was surprised to hear
he was meeting with you.

12:34.858 --> 12:37.226
I found out on the news.

12:37.227 --> 12:39.328
Did it seem important?

12:39.329 --> 12:42.463
He told my staff it was.

12:45.034 --> 12:48.337
Well, I suppose...

12:48.338 --> 12:51.005
it will forever remain a mystery.

12:57.781 --> 12:58.914
Sorry to bother you

12:58.915 --> 13:00.482
during your break, ma'am.

13:00.483 --> 13:05.220
Oh, no, I-I was just running
out to meet Will for lunch.

13:05.221 --> 13:07.323
- Everything okay?
- Well, some surprising news.

13:07.324 --> 13:11.894
President Da Silva has ordered
Mr. Bento's body released.

13:11.895 --> 13:14.830
It is right now in transit
back to Timor-Leste.

13:14.831 --> 13:16.365
Now? What about the autopsy?

13:16.366 --> 13:18.767
There isn't going to be one.

13:18.768 --> 13:21.003
Da Silva is claiming
that Mr. Bento's body

13:21.004 --> 13:23.872
falls under the protections
of diplomatic immunity.

13:23.873 --> 13:25.541
But it's his friend.

13:25.542 --> 13:27.843
Why wouldn't he want to know how he died?

13:27.844 --> 13:29.712
I don't know, ma'am.

13:29.713 --> 13:31.747
I get it.

13:31.748 --> 13:35.517
It's a little stuffy having
lunch at the Four Seasons,

13:35.518 --> 13:37.103
but wasn't there something in the middle?

13:37.104 --> 13:38.620
Something between pâté and street meat?

13:38.621 --> 13:41.023
I'm a little pressed for time.

13:41.024 --> 13:42.725
Need you to do something for me.

13:42.726 --> 13:44.193
You cancel our fancy lunch,

13:44.194 --> 13:45.995
now you want me to do your laundry?

13:45.996 --> 13:47.796
I want you to do a lab test.

13:47.797 --> 13:49.531
Minister Bento's blood is on my blouse.

13:49.532 --> 13:52.134
It's what I was wearing
when he died in front of me.

13:52.135 --> 13:54.503
Don't happen to have a lab on me.

13:54.504 --> 13:56.372
You have to know someone in town, right?

13:56.373 --> 13:58.540
Maybe, but what am I looking for?

13:58.541 --> 14:00.209
What, you think the guy was murdered?

14:01.845 --> 14:03.379
I have no idea.

14:03.380 --> 14:05.781
But something is up.

14:05.782 --> 14:08.317
Bento was desperate to talk to me.

14:08.318 --> 14:10.919
But his president claimed
not to know what it was about.

14:10.920 --> 14:13.856
And then he suddenly
orders the body released,

14:13.857 --> 14:15.591
sent it back home without an autopsy.

14:15.592 --> 14:18.360
Now, I don't want to start
a whole diplomatic firestorm

14:18.361 --> 14:19.895
without some valid evidence.

14:19.896 --> 14:21.730
Why are you looking at me like that?

14:21.731 --> 14:23.298
Because I think you're sublimating.

14:23.299 --> 14:25.234
Don't. That's not even your field.

14:25.235 --> 14:27.669
I did a rotation in psychiatry.

14:27.670 --> 14:29.104
What am I sublimating about?

14:29.105 --> 14:31.673
Guilt over not taking Alison to college.

14:31.674 --> 14:33.609
How do you even know about that?

14:33.610 --> 14:34.877
I'm her cool uncle.

14:34.878 --> 14:36.378
We Bitmoji.

14:36.379 --> 14:37.846
That's not a verb.

14:37.847 --> 14:39.415
She's just indulging you.

14:39.416 --> 14:40.849
She says you're freaking out about

14:40.850 --> 14:43.385
not taking her to a school
that's only an hour away.

14:43.386 --> 14:46.233
Why do people keep saying
that? It is still away.

14:46.234 --> 14:48.297
The point is you can't
invent a murder mystery

14:48.298 --> 14:50.599
- to distract yourself from
missing her send-off. - Okay.

14:50.600 --> 14:53.035
First of all, even if I'm
sublimating, I'm not insane.

14:53.036 --> 14:55.003
These are two separate issues.

14:55.004 --> 14:57.406
And secondly, it makes perfect sense

14:57.407 --> 15:00.542
that sending my daughter
off to college alone...

15:00.543 --> 15:03.378
- With Henry.
- ...would bring up all sorts of things...

15:03.379 --> 15:07.082
for me, about driving
myself to college because

15:07.083 --> 15:08.450
I was an orphan and because

15:08.451 --> 15:12.254
Aunt Joan was away
on... on business, and...

15:12.255 --> 15:15.924
I was the only student, you
know, dragging my belongings

15:15.925 --> 15:19.128
by myself across the quad at UVA.

15:19.129 --> 15:22.631
And that is why, when it was
your turn to go to college,

15:22.632 --> 15:25.701
I moved heaven and Earth so
that I could bring you myself

15:25.702 --> 15:27.836
and you wouldn't have to go through that.

15:27.837 --> 15:30.339
I thought Aunt Joan took me.

15:30.340 --> 15:32.541
What? No, I took you.

15:32.542 --> 15:34.343
I don't think so.

15:34.344 --> 15:36.612
Of course I did. I...

15:36.613 --> 15:39.848
I helped you put up your
anti-apartheid posters

15:39.849 --> 15:41.683
and your Linda Ronstadt posters,

15:41.684 --> 15:43.819
and... and then, remember,
we went and we had...

15:43.820 --> 15:45.587
we had veggie burgers down at the...

15:45.588 --> 15:46.922
How can you not remember that?

15:46.923 --> 15:49.658
I remember Linda Ronstadt, but...

15:49.659 --> 15:53.295
Hey, look, whatever happened,
we both turned out okay.

15:54.597 --> 15:57.032
Except you. You're...
you're serious about this?

15:57.033 --> 15:59.101
You're exhausting. Please, just do it.

15:59.102 --> 16:02.303
Okay.

16:03.705 --> 16:05.707
Thanks for the hot dog.

16:05.708 --> 16:08.343
I'm surprised you remember it.

16:08.344 --> 16:10.078
Ma'am, I finally tracked
down Bento's family.

16:10.079 --> 16:12.181
Turns out that hours after
news of his death broke,

16:12.182 --> 16:14.616
his wife and two teenage sons
got on a plane for Australia

16:14.617 --> 16:16.652
to seek political asylum.
I wasn't able to talk to...

16:16.653 --> 16:17.377
Political asylum?

16:17.378 --> 16:19.454
Yes, ma'am. But I wasn't able
to talk to Mrs. Bento personally

16:19.455 --> 16:20.800
because they're still with
the immigration authorities.

16:20.801 --> 16:22.825
But another thing: we all
went back through our records,

16:22.826 --> 16:24.860
and there are at least a
hundred messages from Bento

16:24.861 --> 16:26.962
over the last few months,
trying to get a meeting with you.

16:26.963 --> 16:28.831
How does that not make
its way up the chain?

16:28.832 --> 16:30.032
Because they were all
to different departments

16:30.033 --> 16:31.700
and he didn't say what
it was about and he was

16:31.701 --> 16:33.769
- an assistant vice minister to
Timor-Leste. We didn't... - Never mind.

16:33.770 --> 16:35.637
It doesn't, it doesn't matter.

16:35.638 --> 16:37.772
Pull whatever strings you
can with the Australians.

16:37.773 --> 16:39.408
I need to get Bento's wife on the phone.

16:39.409 --> 16:41.076
If she has any idea what her husband

16:41.077 --> 16:43.478
wanted to talk to me
about, I need to hear it.

16:43.479 --> 16:44.779
Yes, ma'am.

16:46.615 --> 16:48.183
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:48.184 --> 16:50.485
So, my friend at the lab
rushed the job for me.

16:50.486 --> 16:52.321
Ran a few panels,

16:52.322 --> 16:54.890
but couldn't tell me
the exact compound yet.

16:54.891 --> 16:57.759
But the blood did test
positive for tetrasulfate.

16:57.760 --> 16:59.194
What's that?

16:59.195 --> 17:00.829
Highly toxic material.

17:00.830 --> 17:02.764
Ingested in high doses,
it would kill someone

17:02.765 --> 17:05.901
in less than an hour,
so the guy was poisoned.

17:05.902 --> 17:07.469
So much for sublimating.

17:07.470 --> 17:09.304
Yeah, sorry about that.

17:09.305 --> 17:12.007
So where would... I don't know...

17:12.008 --> 17:15.377
somebody find some tetrasulfate?

17:15.377 --> 17:17.279
Depends on the kind.

17:17.280 --> 17:19.714
She can test for more
specific markers, if you want.

17:19.715 --> 17:21.583
- It'll take a while, but...
- Yes. No, it's great.

17:21.584 --> 17:22.569
All right. I'll let you know.

17:22.569 --> 17:24.887
Look, I know I still
owe you a fancy meal.

17:24.887 --> 17:25.428
Yes.

17:25.429 --> 17:26.954
I just... I got to make some
classified calls. I'll...

17:26.955 --> 17:28.457
All right.

17:28.458 --> 17:31.260
From what we gather, President Da Silva

17:31.261 --> 17:33.095
and Bento were friends.

17:33.096 --> 17:34.529
The relationship seemed to strain

17:34.530 --> 17:38.000
after Bento fought the sale of
their atolls to Chinese buyers.

17:38.001 --> 17:40.869
In fact, when Bento made
those protestations last year,

17:40.870 --> 17:43.138
it was not as assistant vice minister

17:43.139 --> 17:45.340
of foreign affairs, but as
the minister of commerce.

17:45.341 --> 17:47.476
Looks like China finally got through

17:47.477 --> 17:49.978
to Da Silva, who betrayed
his friend, demoted him,

17:49.979 --> 17:53.015
and quietly sold off the
islands to a shadowy buyer.

17:53.016 --> 17:55.083
Like a front for a Chinese
state-owned enterprise.

17:55.084 --> 17:56.251
Yes, sir.

17:56.252 --> 17:58.353
And I think that Bento was going to

17:58.354 --> 18:00.022
blow the whistle to me, and then

18:00.023 --> 18:03.392
Da Silva got wind of his
intentions and had him killed.

18:03.393 --> 18:04.960
I realize that murdering
your own diplomats

18:04.961 --> 18:06.328
is all the rage these days,

18:06.329 --> 18:08.730
but they're not getting away
with it on American soil,

18:08.731 --> 18:10.899
at the U.N. General Assembly, no less.

18:10.900 --> 18:12.834
If Da Silva was involved in this,

18:12.835 --> 18:14.276
I'll give him the Noriega treatment.

18:14.277 --> 18:15.431
FBI is into it,

18:15.432 --> 18:18.729
but in the meantime, we need to
send a public message to China

18:18.730 --> 18:21.598
and to Timor-Leste that we're onto them.

18:21.599 --> 18:23.400
Any ideas?

18:23.401 --> 18:26.737
Tell the press that
American authorities suspect

18:26.738 --> 18:28.639
Bento was the victim of foul play,

18:28.640 --> 18:32.276
and are looking into
several leads and prospects.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.278
Just need your
authorization to go public.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.245
You've got it.

18:37.815 --> 18:39.116
Sir.

18:39.117 --> 18:41.251
Dad, we don't have to unpack everything

18:41.252 --> 18:43.120
right this second. You
have 18 pairs of shoes.

18:43.121 --> 18:44.722
You need to find a home for them.

18:44.723 --> 18:46.223
I will, later.

18:46.224 --> 18:47.491
Why would you put that off?

18:47.492 --> 18:49.126
Because I'm starving.

18:49.127 --> 18:50.394
Can I go to the dining hall, please?

18:50.395 --> 18:52.329
You can totally have the rest of this.

18:52.330 --> 18:54.335
- I'm kind of making myself sick.
- Oh, no, thanks.

18:54.336 --> 18:55.752
I don't know why he's being like this.

18:55.753 --> 18:57.334
I'm a marine. You finish the job.

18:57.335 --> 18:58.502
You were a marine.

18:58.503 --> 19:00.738
No, there's no past tense to "marine."

19:00.739 --> 19:04.274
Wait, you mean, like,
someone who trains dolphins?

19:04.275 --> 19:06.110
Seriously, you should hang your stuff up

19:06.111 --> 19:07.511
so that the wrinkles fall out.

19:07.512 --> 19:10.247
I'm looking for a Bayard freshman

19:10.248 --> 19:12.950
- studying fashion and design.
- Ah, finally!

19:12.951 --> 19:14.451
Thank goodness! Oh!

19:14.452 --> 19:17.254
I thought he was having some
sort of mental breakdown.

19:17.255 --> 19:18.455
Ali.

19:18.456 --> 19:20.324
Surprise.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.759
You left UNGA for this?

19:21.760 --> 19:23.327
Well, you can thank the Chinese.

19:23.328 --> 19:25.529
They pulled out of our
biggest negotiation.

19:25.530 --> 19:27.564
You see, there's a silver
lining to everything.

19:27.565 --> 19:30.000
- Mwah, mwah, mwah!
- Okay, okay, okay.

19:30.001 --> 19:31.969
Uh, Mom, this is my roommate, Lucinda.

19:31.970 --> 19:33.470
- Oh, nice to meet you, Mrs. Secretary.
- Lucinda.

19:33.471 --> 19:35.239
I'd shake your hand, but
they're, like, all gross.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.707
Oh, sure.

19:36.708 --> 19:38.876
Oh, I guess I got this stuff everywhere.

19:38.877 --> 19:41.545
You know what would clean that right up.

19:41.546 --> 19:43.480
- Oh, here we go. - Come on.
- We're gonna go eat.

19:43.481 --> 19:46.583
Wow. It's incredible.

19:46.584 --> 19:48.152
They have a sushi bar. Vegan station.

19:48.153 --> 19:49.953
Did you see the vegan station?

19:49.954 --> 19:51.355
Mac and cheese is
solid... that's the true

19:51.356 --> 19:52.790
litmus test of a good cafeteria.

19:52.791 --> 19:54.992
Okay, you guys do not
need to over-love it.

19:54.993 --> 19:57.267
You can just like it.
I'm secure in my choice.

19:57.268 --> 19:58.762
All right, well, I'm gonna
go to the dessert bar,

19:58.763 --> 20:00.186
which looks totally ordinary, by the way.

20:00.187 --> 20:01.765
- Can I get an ordinary brownie?
- Yes.

20:01.766 --> 20:02.900
Maybe give it a second.

20:02.901 --> 20:04.902
There's some staring going on.

20:04.903 --> 20:07.304
Oh, sweetheart, we don't worry...

20:07.305 --> 20:09.807
Mom, there's normal staring,
and then there's creepy staring.

20:09.808 --> 20:12.442
- This feels like creepy staring.
- It does?

20:12.443 --> 20:13.710
- Kinda.
- Sorry, uh, to interrupt,

20:13.711 --> 20:15.512
but we should really get on the road soon

20:15.513 --> 20:17.080
if you want to have a safe cushion

20:17.081 --> 20:19.116
- for the Marty Hawk interview.
- All right, here we go.

20:19.117 --> 20:21.685
Just quick.

20:21.686 --> 20:23.987
Okay, listen, you just FaceTime me

20:23.988 --> 20:25.689
- or text or Skype or...
- Bye, babe.

20:25.690 --> 20:26.790
I will.

20:26.791 --> 20:30.427
You know, you could
call, you could dial...

20:30.428 --> 20:32.663
I'm not crying. I'm not crying.

20:32.664 --> 20:34.398
I'm just misting. It's
not the same thing.

20:34.399 --> 20:35.966
Yes, ma'am.

20:35.967 --> 20:37.801
Did we really have to leave that early,

20:37.802 --> 20:39.870
or are you just trying
to get me out of there

20:39.871 --> 20:41.338
before I unravel and
humiliate my daughter?

20:41.339 --> 20:43.640
Um, I am trying to get
you out of this setting.

20:43.641 --> 20:45.108
Ma'am, there's a story
trending on Twitter.

20:45.109 --> 20:46.310
God, what now?

20:46.311 --> 20:48.545
It's about the Assistant
Vice Minister Bento.

20:48.546 --> 20:49.913
It seems that you may have, um...

20:49.914 --> 20:51.615
Oh, wow, I don't know how to say this.

20:51.616 --> 20:53.450
- Just say it.
- You murdered him.

20:55.286 --> 20:56.919
This way.

21:01.814 --> 21:05.092
It began on a conspiracy
- mongering fringe website

21:05.093 --> 21:08.290
called, hmm, "Champion of Facts."

21:08.291 --> 21:12.628
It spread through social media
at an alarmingly fast rate.

21:12.629 --> 21:15.731
It's retweeted and shared
through countless sources.

21:15.732 --> 21:19.902
What's not helping are the
hundred-plus phone calls

21:19.903 --> 21:22.004
that Mr. Bento made to our office.

21:22.005 --> 21:23.305
The unanswered ones?

21:23.306 --> 21:24.973
Yes, ma'am.

21:24.974 --> 21:27.318
Uh, apparently, you were avoiding him

21:27.319 --> 21:29.420
because he had something on you.

21:29.421 --> 21:31.956
Then you became hysterical...
revealing choice of words...

21:31.957 --> 21:35.426
and so you stabbed him in the
chest during an unscheduled,

21:35.427 --> 21:37.628
closed-door meeting with him at the U.N.

21:37.629 --> 21:40.331
Well, hysterical or not, if I
was gonna have someone killed,

21:40.332 --> 21:42.533
I'd at least be a
little discreet about it.

21:42.534 --> 21:44.168
I was in the CIA.

21:44.169 --> 21:46.470
That's been mentioned
more than a few times.

21:46.471 --> 21:49.907
You were trained to kill
with your bare hands.

21:49.908 --> 21:51.742
Well, what was it?

21:51.743 --> 21:53.878
A knife or my bare hands?

21:53.879 --> 21:55.346
There's an open forum.

21:55.347 --> 21:57.681
Ma'am, they're ready for you.

22:00.084 --> 22:04.188
I'd be remiss if I didn't
offer the possibility

22:04.189 --> 22:07.425
of bowing out of this interview,
given the circumstances.

22:07.426 --> 22:11.362
Well, I appreciate that, but
there is still a strong divide

22:11.363 --> 22:15.666
between legitimate news
sources and fringe-based hooey.

22:15.667 --> 22:18.336
This appearance is gonna
drive that point home.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.404
Yes, ma'am.

22:20.405 --> 22:22.506
We're very excited about
the policy initiatives

22:22.507 --> 22:25.109
that we're working on at the
U.N. General Assembly this week.

22:25.110 --> 22:27.178
- Global education standards.
- Mm-hmm.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.547
Preserving marine biodiversity.

22:29.548 --> 22:31.682
New research into global food security...

22:31.683 --> 22:35.186
What-What's going on with China
and the free speech resolution?

22:35.187 --> 22:38.256
Yeah. We are disappointed by the
setback that we're having there.

22:38.257 --> 22:39.212
- Yeah.
- I remain optim...

22:39.213 --> 22:40.730
I'm sure that the, uh, recent death

22:40.731 --> 22:44.367
of the assistant vice minister
of Timor-Leste, Rogério Bento,

22:44.368 --> 22:50.006
was a complicating factor
on the first day of the UNGA?

22:50.007 --> 22:52.975
I think Mr. Bento's
death is more a tragedy...

22:52.976 --> 22:55.344
You were in the room with him
when this tragedy occurred.

22:55.345 --> 22:56.546
- Is that right?
- Yes.

22:56.547 --> 22:58.981
And so, of course,
now there's no avoiding

22:58.982 --> 23:00.983
talking about this shocking rumor

23:00.984 --> 23:03.653
that's taken hold of social media

23:03.654 --> 23:07.723
and is being reported on
several Web-based news outlets

23:07.724 --> 23:10.159
that you were somehow
responsible for his death.

23:10.160 --> 23:11.894
Seriously, you're going there?

23:11.895 --> 23:15.063
I'm just giving you a
chance to explain yourself.

23:16.766 --> 23:18.367
These Web-based news outlets

23:18.368 --> 23:21.604
to which you refer, as you
know, are little more than blogs

23:21.605 --> 23:24.206
written by known perpetuators
of conspiracy theories...

23:24.207 --> 23:25.975
Okay. Okay, even so,

23:25.976 --> 23:28.077
this claim has gained more credence

23:28.078 --> 23:31.514
just moments a ago when
Arizona Senator Carlos Morejon

23:31.515 --> 23:33.916
spoke out about it at a press conference.

23:33.917 --> 23:35.318
Let's watch.

23:35.319 --> 23:37.019
I, along with everyone else,

23:37.020 --> 23:39.121
am shocked and alarmed
at these accusations

23:39.122 --> 23:41.357
concerning Secretary McCord's involvement

23:41.358 --> 23:42.858
in Mr. Bento's death.

23:42.859 --> 23:45.761
I can assure you congressional
inquiries will be made,

23:45.762 --> 23:47.830
and if there's even a whiff of truth,

23:47.831 --> 23:50.066
I will demand the immediate removal

23:50.067 --> 23:52.535
of Secretary McCord from her post.

23:52.536 --> 23:55.204
You think the secretary
is guilty of murder?

23:55.205 --> 23:58.841
Those are your words, not mine.

23:58.842 --> 24:00.309
I'm leaving it to the FBI

24:00.310 --> 24:02.811
to see if charges should
be brought against her.

24:04.947 --> 24:06.582
Care to comment?

24:06.583 --> 24:10.486
I... I wouldn't know where to begin.

24:10.487 --> 24:12.888
- Senator Morejon says it doesn't...
- But maybe with the fact

24:12.889 --> 24:14.724
that this is obvious crackpot theorizing,

24:14.725 --> 24:16.826
which quite possibly is

24:16.827 --> 24:20.062
the work of a disinformation
campaign by a foreign power.

24:20.063 --> 24:21.430
You mean, say, China...

24:21.431 --> 24:23.432
What Senator Morejon is doing

24:23.433 --> 24:25.468
by legitimizing this baseless story...

24:25.469 --> 24:28.437
it's not just immoral and unethical.

24:28.438 --> 24:31.240
It undermines the stability
of democratic government.

24:31.241 --> 24:32.541
That's an overstatement.

24:32.542 --> 24:34.243
Reliable information is

24:34.244 --> 24:36.545
the bedrock of any
institution, be it science,

24:36.546 --> 24:38.114
government or private enterprise.

24:38.115 --> 24:39.348
Of course.

24:39.349 --> 24:41.283
If citizens can't tell the difference

24:41.284 --> 24:42.918
between fact and fiction,

24:42.919 --> 24:45.388
then the entire project of
civilization turns to dust.

24:45.389 --> 24:47.823
Yeah, not to put too fine a point on it.

24:47.824 --> 24:49.392
You find this amusing, Marty?

24:49.393 --> 24:51.861
Hey, no, not at all, but it is no secret

24:51.862 --> 24:54.096
that Senator Morejon is no fan of yours,

24:54.097 --> 24:55.731
or President Dalton, so he is entirely...

24:55.732 --> 24:58.134
So as an elected member of
Congress, he's within his right

24:58.135 --> 25:00.336
to do whatever he can to
block the executive agenda.

25:00.337 --> 25:01.270
Absolutely.

25:01.271 --> 25:03.105
But by bringing legitimacy

25:03.106 --> 25:05.408
to a ridiculous murder claim against me,

25:05.409 --> 25:08.144
he's using the tactics
not just of dirty politics

25:08.145 --> 25:09.478
but of warfare.

25:09.479 --> 25:11.380
- I don't think so.
- Because it's dictatorial.

25:11.381 --> 25:13.349
It's autocratic.

25:13.350 --> 25:14.811
And it's un-American.

25:14.812 --> 25:16.118
I think the senator would
say he's just trying...

25:16.119 --> 25:17.887
Furthermore, a mainstream media outlet

25:17.888 --> 25:19.989
ought to have a better understanding

25:19.990 --> 25:22.224
of its responsibility to the public,

25:22.225 --> 25:25.094
and refuse to signal-boost
these kinds of outright lies.

25:25.095 --> 25:27.296
- You are in no...
- Really.

25:27.297 --> 25:29.130
You ought to know better.

25:30.199 --> 25:33.636
Well, you guys are
gonna have a busy night.

25:33.637 --> 25:34.937
Sorry about that.

25:34.938 --> 25:36.338
It's the right thing to do.

25:36.339 --> 25:37.940
Honor to clean up your mess, ma'am.

25:37.941 --> 25:40.109
For the moment, we'll just
stand by your statement

25:40.110 --> 25:41.911
and monitor the situation.

25:41.912 --> 25:44.046
Oh. Ma'am, this doesn't look good.

25:44.047 --> 25:47.249
Murderer! Murderer!

25:51.320 --> 25:55.156
Murderer! Murderer! Murderer!

26:01.976 --> 26:04.411
I believe that's Mr.
Jackson's knock, ma'am.

26:04.412 --> 26:06.213
And his angry knock, at that.

26:06.214 --> 26:09.449
What in the name of all that
is holy were you thinking?!

26:09.450 --> 26:10.717
Good ear, ma'am.

26:10.718 --> 26:11.685
What?

26:11.686 --> 26:13.220
Nothing. Coffee, Russell?

26:13.221 --> 26:15.656
Or a sedative of some kind?

26:15.657 --> 26:18.058
An overnight snap poll indicates

26:18.059 --> 26:21.862
that 22% of Americans believe
you're guilty of murder.

26:21.863 --> 26:22.963
Well, that's not

26:22.964 --> 26:24.865
so bad, considering.

26:24.866 --> 26:27.000
Before your little outburst
on Marty Hawk's show,

26:27.001 --> 26:29.236
that same poll was at 17%.

26:29.237 --> 26:32.172
Because you seemed to forget

26:32.173 --> 26:35.008
that when something
crazy hits the news cycle,

26:35.009 --> 26:38.178
your job is to lie low
until it churns past!

26:38.179 --> 26:39.980
But no, you thought

26:39.981 --> 26:42.749
you'd try putting some
kerosene on the crazy,

26:42.750 --> 26:45.285
and now it's a veritable
bonfire of what the hell!

26:45.286 --> 26:46.620
I couldn't just sit there

26:46.621 --> 26:48.522
and let fake news control the narrative.

26:48.523 --> 26:49.756
Oh, yeah?

26:49.757 --> 26:51.191
Well, here's the problem with

26:51.192 --> 26:53.093
our golden brainchild, free speech...

26:53.094 --> 26:55.696
which I love as much as the next guy.

26:55.697 --> 26:57.531
In the age of the Internet,

26:57.532 --> 27:00.968
it means a lot of nutjobs
reach just as wide an audience

27:00.969 --> 27:02.935
as the secretary of state.

27:03.737 --> 27:06.039
And you throwing
patriotic temper tantrums

27:06.040 --> 27:09.076
on live TV isn't doing you any favors.

27:09.077 --> 27:12.646
Neither is sitting there
mute after she's been ambushed

27:12.647 --> 27:16.882
by someone pretending to
represent legitimate journalism.

27:17.684 --> 27:20.620
Instead of throwing your own tantrum

27:20.621 --> 27:24.224
and blaming the victim for
this latest tool of terrorism,

27:24.225 --> 27:29.662
why don't you grow a spine
and do something about it?!

27:34.534 --> 27:36.802
Let's put a pin in that.

27:38.905 --> 27:41.541
May I remind both of you

27:41.542 --> 27:43.577
that the Washington press is well aware

27:43.578 --> 27:46.947
of the secretary's crucial
role in the president's cabinet,

27:46.948 --> 27:52.119
and they link her success
and credibility to his.

27:52.120 --> 27:57.591
If America is even entertaining
the idea that she is a murderer,

27:57.592 --> 27:59.526
that means his legislative agenda,

27:59.527 --> 28:04.765
his foreign policy agenda,
even his legacy are all at risk.

28:04.766 --> 28:07.034
We will handle this

28:07.035 --> 28:08.935
at the top.

28:08.936 --> 28:11.405
In the meantime,

28:11.406 --> 28:15.507
I am respectfully requesting
that you refrain from comment.

28:16.176 --> 28:18.711
By which I mean, put a sock in it!

28:20.747 --> 28:23.450
Forget about it, Nadine. We're all upset.

28:23.451 --> 28:25.752
I'm not apologizing, Russell!

28:26.888 --> 28:29.058
I apologize, ma'am.

28:29.059 --> 28:30.860
Well, thank you.

28:30.861 --> 28:32.527
It's okay.

28:34.497 --> 28:36.464
Um...

28:39.168 --> 28:42.905
To quote Judge Louis Brandeis,

28:42.906 --> 28:47.910
"Sunlight is said to be
the best of disinfectants."

28:47.911 --> 28:50.546
The only way we can possibly fight

28:50.547 --> 28:52.782
this rumor is with the truth.

28:52.783 --> 28:55.952
I've had a text from Jay.

28:55.953 --> 28:59.020
He's found Mrs. Bento,
and she's willing to talk.

29:03.192 --> 29:05.194
Dr. McCord,

29:05.195 --> 29:07.129
I want to thank you for the opportunity

29:07.130 --> 29:08.230
you have given my brother.

29:08.231 --> 29:10.466
It's good to see him so happy.

29:10.467 --> 29:11.644
I'm glad we could

29:11.645 --> 29:12.854
work it out.

29:12.882 --> 29:15.317
So, you continue with your covers:

29:15.318 --> 29:17.519
Alexander Mehranov, his sister Dina.

29:17.520 --> 29:20.154
Alexander will continue to work in I.T.

29:21.656 --> 29:23.859
If the Russians discover
you're working with

29:23.860 --> 29:26.695
the Special Activities Division,

29:26.696 --> 29:28.997
they will be even more motivated

29:28.998 --> 29:30.699
to keep you from intelligence work.

29:30.700 --> 29:34.169
And they will use every
covert means available to them

29:34.170 --> 29:35.803
to stop it.

29:36.905 --> 29:40.108
You need to be vigilant.

29:40.109 --> 29:42.310
And keep a very low profile.

29:42.311 --> 29:45.047
We know how to do that, Dr. McCord.

29:45.048 --> 29:48.218
You have a lot to prove to the bosses.

29:49.918 --> 29:51.819
And so do I.

29:54.556 --> 29:56.123
I won't let you down.

29:57.548 --> 29:59.253
I don't know much of anything,

29:59.254 --> 30:00.740
ma'am.

30:00.741 --> 30:04.110
Rogério kept me in the
dark regarding his work.

30:04.111 --> 30:06.646
I do know he was under

30:06.647 --> 30:10.217
a great deal of strain after the islands

30:10.218 --> 30:12.652
he fought so hard to protect

30:12.653 --> 30:15.422
were sold off anyway to anonymous buyers.

30:15.423 --> 30:20.126
This only added to the emotional distress

30:20.127 --> 30:23.296
we both were feeling after
the loss of our daughter.

30:23.297 --> 30:25.165
I don't know if you're aware.

30:25.166 --> 30:28.935
She died of a cocaine
overdose six months ago.

30:28.936 --> 30:32.205
President Da Silva told me
that it was a car accident.

30:32.206 --> 30:36.243
Maybe he told you that to protect us.

30:36.244 --> 30:39.246
He was always looking out for us.

30:39.247 --> 30:41.248
After Rogério died,
he called me immediately

30:41.249 --> 30:45.085
and told me I was no
longer safe in Timor-Leste.

30:45.086 --> 30:48.488
He said he could use his connections

30:48.489 --> 30:50.757
in the Australian government to ensure

30:50.758 --> 30:53.226
our immigration process was a smooth one.

30:53.227 --> 30:55.262
W-Why weren't you safe there?

30:55.263 --> 30:59.032
He didn't say, and I didn't ask.

30:59.033 --> 31:01.501
I trust him.

31:01.502 --> 31:05.338
He is such a good friend to us.

31:08.808 --> 31:11.411
Thank you for speaking
with me, Mrs. Bento.

31:11.412 --> 31:13.113
I really appreciate your time.

31:13.114 --> 31:15.882
Again, my deepest sympathies.

31:15.883 --> 31:17.149
Good-bye, ma'am.

31:18.919 --> 31:20.587
Well, that's interesting.

31:20.588 --> 31:23.450
Why would Da Silva lie to me?

31:23.451 --> 31:25.184
Especially when he
knows you could kill him

31:25.185 --> 31:26.185
with a cocktail glass.

31:26.186 --> 31:27.319
That's the latest rumor.

31:27.320 --> 31:28.587
So not funny yet.

31:28.588 --> 31:29.955
Ma'am, Dr. Adams.

31:29.956 --> 31:31.190
Hey.

31:31.191 --> 31:32.191
Hey, killer.

31:32.192 --> 31:33.826
Ah.

31:33.827 --> 31:34.893
You all lawyered up?

31:34.894 --> 31:35.995
That's hilarious.

31:35.996 --> 31:37.461
Why's it funny when he does it?

31:37.462 --> 31:38.331
It's not.

31:38.332 --> 31:39.565
Something tells me you're not here

31:39.566 --> 31:41.808
just to make orange jumpsuit jokes.

31:41.809 --> 31:47.080
I, uh, have the final
results of Bento's blood test.

31:47.081 --> 31:49.749
No, go ahead. Everybody's been read in.

31:49.750 --> 31:51.251
All right.

31:51.252 --> 31:57.424
The exact compound in his blood
was dimethyl tetrasulfide-5.

31:57.425 --> 31:59.125
Very rare, very toxic chemical.

31:59.126 --> 32:01.161
According to my friend in the lab,

32:01.162 --> 32:03.163
there are only two
bad actors known to use

32:03.164 --> 32:04.964
this particular compound for homicide.

32:04.965 --> 32:06.462
Only the Russians, as far as I know.

32:06.463 --> 32:08.301
And the Colima Cartel.

32:09.470 --> 32:12.472
Uh, an up-and-coming
Mexican drug organization.

32:12.473 --> 32:13.239
Excuse me.

32:13.240 --> 32:14.941
How are they connected to Timor-Leste?

32:14.942 --> 32:16.276
Mrs. Bento said

32:16.277 --> 32:18.678
her daughter died of a cocaine overdose.

32:18.679 --> 32:20.146
It's possible to find that

32:20.147 --> 32:22.916
in Maritime Southeast
Asia, but it's rare.

32:22.917 --> 32:25.218
She's right. The coca plant
doesn't grow in that region.

32:25.219 --> 32:27.353
It can only be produced
in the Western Hemisphere,

32:27.354 --> 32:29.622
which means it's in high
demand in Asian markets.

32:29.623 --> 32:33.426
W-What if the Colima Cartel
were looking to break in?

32:33.427 --> 32:36.229
They'd want a small,
offshore sovereign nation

32:36.230 --> 32:37.664
to use as a convenient port.

32:37.665 --> 32:39.098
A country that was poor

32:39.099 --> 32:40.900
and susceptible to
corruption would be ideal.

32:40.901 --> 32:42.468
They could have muscled the president

32:42.469 --> 32:44.337
of Timor-Leste into
selling them a small island,

32:44.338 --> 32:46.072
using a dummy corporation
to hide their involvement.

32:46.073 --> 32:48.141
If that's the case,
then the Colima Cartel

32:48.142 --> 32:50.043
has become so powerful
that they could murder

32:50.044 --> 32:52.278
a diplomatic official inside the U.N.

32:52.279 --> 32:53.513
and silence President Da Silva.

32:53.514 --> 32:55.181
Then they have infiltrated the government

32:55.182 --> 32:56.616
at the highest level.

32:56.617 --> 32:59.352
Little Timor-Leste is at risk
of becoming a narco state.

32:59.353 --> 33:02.055
And the cartel is driving
the fake news story

33:02.056 --> 33:04.791
to discredit anything that I
might have heard from Bento.

33:04.792 --> 33:06.626
You're in their crosshairs, ma'am.

33:06.627 --> 33:08.661
We have to get on top of this before...

33:08.662 --> 33:10.730
Before they get more creative?

33:10.731 --> 33:12.098
Well...

33:12.099 --> 33:13.433
It would be almost impossible

33:13.434 --> 33:15.234
- for them to get past your detail.
- Ha.

33:15.235 --> 33:17.270
I'm sure you're in no in
real danger. It's just...

33:17.271 --> 33:19.439
That they killed a guy
right in front of me

33:19.440 --> 33:21.007
at the U.N., and who knows

33:21.008 --> 33:22.508
what else they could do?

33:22.509 --> 33:24.776
Yes, ma'am.

33:26.045 --> 33:27.679
Excuse me.

33:34.359 --> 33:37.930
I know why Mr. Bento
was so eager to see me.

33:37.931 --> 33:40.675
It was a last-ditch
effort to get the word out

33:40.676 --> 33:42.810
that the Colima Cartel had
taken over the government

33:42.811 --> 33:43.778
of Timor-Leste.

33:43.779 --> 33:45.580
I assure you, this is not the case.

33:45.581 --> 33:47.815
And that they had gone so far

33:47.816 --> 33:51.586
as to purchase entire
islands to set up shop.

33:51.587 --> 33:54.956
We've connected the dots, Mr. President.

33:54.957 --> 33:56.890
It's useless to deny it.

33:58.159 --> 34:00.628
Rogério was a good man.

34:00.629 --> 34:02.930
And you were his friend.

34:02.931 --> 34:05.166
The way that you took care of his family

34:05.167 --> 34:08.534
when they were in danger
tells me who you are.

34:11.406 --> 34:13.373
And I know that you want your country

34:13.375 --> 34:17.078
to be a sovereign nation again.

34:17.079 --> 34:19.079
Why don't you let us help you?

34:23.418 --> 34:27.955
I resisted them for a long time.

34:27.956 --> 34:31.958
But the cartels have become
too rich with money and guns

34:31.960 --> 34:33.761
for us to even fight back.

34:33.762 --> 34:38.065
They have taken our nation by force.

34:38.067 --> 34:40.667
Threatening our lives and family.

34:41.810 --> 34:43.971
Rogério was stronger than I.

34:43.972 --> 34:46.741
He fought to the end.

34:46.742 --> 34:48.810
That's why he was killed.

34:48.811 --> 34:52.946
He was willing to die for
his country, and I was not.

34:57.385 --> 35:00.621
It's not too late.

35:00.622 --> 35:06.127
You can use his sacrifice
to turn this around.

35:06.128 --> 35:08.930
You speak out publicly
against the cartel,

35:08.931 --> 35:11.232
bring these killers to justice,

35:11.233 --> 35:14.035
and you will have the full
backing of the United States.

35:14.036 --> 35:15.436
You have my word on that.

35:15.437 --> 35:17.672
Your government has
been trying to root out

35:17.673 --> 35:20.241
the cartels in Mexico for decades,

35:20.242 --> 35:21.542
and Colombia before that.

35:21.543 --> 35:23.611
Yes, but in those cases,

35:23.612 --> 35:25.813
we didn't have China on our side.

35:25.814 --> 35:27.682
If we can get them on board,

35:27.683 --> 35:31.185
I believe that we can
give you back your country.

35:31.186 --> 35:34.455
And Ana and her sons can return home.

35:34.456 --> 35:36.891
And you can watch Rogério's sons grow up

35:36.892 --> 35:39.427
and be a second father to them.

35:39.428 --> 35:41.595
Remind them of who he was.

35:42.830 --> 35:45.700
I would give anything for that.

35:45.701 --> 35:48.301
Then work with me.

35:51.674 --> 35:52.740
Thank you for

35:52.741 --> 35:53.975
agreeing to meet with me.

35:53.976 --> 35:56.444
I know we haven't been on
the best of terms lately.

35:56.445 --> 35:58.279
What with you standing me up and all.

35:58.280 --> 36:01.249
What with you pulling out of the
free speech resolution and all.

36:01.250 --> 36:04.886
But fun as it is, we're
gonna have to skip this part.

36:04.887 --> 36:06.654
The situation in Timor-Leste

36:06.655 --> 36:08.756
requires your immediate attention.

36:08.757 --> 36:11.092
Now, I know that China has no interest

36:11.093 --> 36:14.428
in an expanded presence of illegal drugs.

36:14.429 --> 36:17.431
But I also think you turn a blind eye

36:17.432 --> 36:20.768
when your chemical companies
sell MDMA and meth precursors

36:20.769 --> 36:22.203
to countries abroad.

36:22.204 --> 36:25.173
Does this have something to do
with your troubles in the news?

36:25.174 --> 36:29.510
This has something to do with
everyone's troubles in the news.

36:29.511 --> 36:31.746
Oh, now, look. See?

36:31.747 --> 36:35.049
This is what I was
hoping wouldn't happen.

36:35.050 --> 36:36.918
Now you're in my story.

36:36.919 --> 36:38.820
How's that?

36:38.821 --> 36:40.988
"Foreign Minister Chen has secret meeting

36:40.989 --> 36:45.059
with Elizabeth McCord following
the death of Rogério Bento."

36:45.060 --> 36:46.594
You set me up.

36:46.595 --> 36:49.297
No, I-I didn't need to.

36:49.298 --> 36:51.432
This is what we're all facing

36:51.433 --> 36:53.835
if we don't fight back against bad actors

36:53.836 --> 36:56.470
weaponizing the news.

36:56.471 --> 36:59.440
The Colima Cartel is
manipulating this narrative.

36:59.441 --> 37:01.943
Right now, they're focused on me.

37:01.944 --> 37:04.445
Tomorrow, could be you.

37:04.446 --> 37:05.680
As you know,

37:05.681 --> 37:08.115
we have safeguards against
that kind of thing in China.

37:08.116 --> 37:10.384
Perhaps you are seeing
the upside of it now.

37:10.385 --> 37:13.754
Eh, we're kind of married to
the idea of free press, thanks.

37:13.755 --> 37:17.391
But even your regulations
won't stop some guy in Macedonia

37:17.392 --> 37:21.062
being paid to manufacture clickbait. No.

37:21.063 --> 37:22.897
We are all going to lose this battle

37:22.898 --> 37:26.434
if we don't stand
together and call it out.

37:26.435 --> 37:28.236
Just as you're going to lose the battle

37:28.237 --> 37:31.305
against an epidemic of
cocaine and heroin addiction

37:31.306 --> 37:33.074
if you don't get ahead of it now.

37:33.075 --> 37:36.444
Perhaps you'd rather talk
about this in another location?

37:36.445 --> 37:38.179
I have nothing to hide.

37:38.180 --> 37:41.215
Do you, Minister Chen?

37:41.216 --> 37:42.950
Certainly not.

37:42.951 --> 37:44.385
Well, then we're fine.

37:44.386 --> 37:46.454
Madam Secretary, what
do you have to say about

37:46.455 --> 37:47.555
the murder charges?

37:47.556 --> 37:49.557
What is the purpose of this meeting?

37:49.558 --> 37:51.225
Minister Chen, did you know the deceased?

38:00.201 --> 38:01.802
Did you find any?

38:01.803 --> 38:03.403
_

38:04.405 --> 38:06.574
Talia, English!

38:06.575 --> 38:09.543
Also, it was very expensive.

38:09.544 --> 38:12.346
You know, there are other
ways to treat your injuries.

38:12.347 --> 38:13.915
Dr. McCord found me a good doctor.

38:13.916 --> 38:15.449
He could do the same for you.

38:15.450 --> 38:17.151
I will be fine.

38:17.152 --> 38:19.987
Didn't they ask you about
drugs on your polygraph test?

38:19.988 --> 38:22.580
Russian military taught me
how to beat a polygraph test

38:22.581 --> 38:23.324
since I was 17.

38:23.325 --> 38:25.693
If you're like this without
your pills for one day,

38:25.694 --> 38:27.414
what will happen when you're working

38:27.415 --> 38:29.138
and you don't have them for a week?

38:29.965 --> 38:32.934
Dr. McCord has done so much for us.

38:32.935 --> 38:34.135
He's depending on you.

38:34.136 --> 38:35.436
Don't lecture me!

38:35.437 --> 38:38.571
I've taken care of everything
this far, haven't I?!

38:40.808 --> 38:44.378
Look, you have to trust me.

38:44.379 --> 38:47.548
I know what I'm doing!

38:47.549 --> 38:49.016
A dramatic scene

38:49.017 --> 38:51.452
in the small Pacific nation
of Timor-Leste this evening,

38:51.453 --> 38:54.655
as DEA agents took custody
of Enrique Villareal,

38:54.656 --> 38:58.159
a high-ranking member of
the notorious Colima Cartel.

38:58.160 --> 39:00.194
According to DEA officials,
the Mexico-based cartel

39:00.195 --> 39:01.937
has been using Timor-Leste

39:01.938 --> 39:04.239
as a staging point for
drug-smuggling operations...

39:04.240 --> 39:06.141
Welcome home.

39:06.142 --> 39:09.344
This arrest comes as part of a major...

39:09.345 --> 39:10.679
I want to be asleep.

39:10.680 --> 39:13.448
DEA made quick work of the Colima Cartel.

39:13.449 --> 39:15.817
What'd you do, threaten
them with a cocktail glass?

39:17.954 --> 39:19.988
No.

39:19.989 --> 39:22.023
I threatened Minister
Chen with the nightmare

39:22.024 --> 39:26.294
of what China would look like
if heroin and cocaine become

39:26.295 --> 39:30.899
as much of an epidemic in
his country as it is in mine.

39:30.900 --> 39:34.035
He likes when I play
into their superiority.

39:34.036 --> 39:35.136
And as Kissinger said,

39:35.137 --> 39:37.506
- it has the added benefit of being true.
- Ha.

39:37.507 --> 39:40.175
So, here we are,

39:40.176 --> 39:43.211
in a brand-new news cycle.

39:43.212 --> 39:44.479
Uh, not so fast.

39:44.480 --> 39:47.549
The latest snap poll has 12% of Americans

39:47.550 --> 39:50.919
thinking you're a murderer.

39:50.920 --> 39:53.855
Well, that's half what it was.

39:53.856 --> 39:55.423
So we're moving in the right direction.

39:56.659 --> 40:01.528
Scary how fast everyone
jumped aboard that train.

40:03.164 --> 40:06.101
Even scarier to think
that a drug syndicate

40:06.102 --> 40:10.839
can use the power of fake
news to rattle a country,

40:10.840 --> 40:14.309
convince them to lose faith
in their government officials.

40:14.310 --> 40:17.512
The bad guys have a powerful new weapon.

40:17.513 --> 40:20.414
And we don't know how to fight it.

40:22.117 --> 40:23.952
Figure that out, okay?

40:23.953 --> 40:25.353
I'm working on it.

40:25.354 --> 40:26.687
Mm.

40:29.324 --> 40:30.859
No, no, no.

40:30.860 --> 40:32.460
No. Mm.

40:32.461 --> 40:34.596
You still interested in getting a hobby?

40:34.597 --> 40:37.465
This is not a hobby.

40:37.466 --> 40:39.801
It is if you're doing it right.

40:45.373 --> 40:47.008
Ah. Madam Secretary.

40:47.009 --> 40:48.410
Chief Justice.

40:48.411 --> 40:51.079
I don't think I've ever
seen you in here before.

40:51.080 --> 40:53.505
No, I'm not much of a
power breakfast type.

40:53.506 --> 40:54.282
Mm.

40:54.283 --> 40:56.184
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

40:56.185 --> 40:59.354
It's just I'm more of a
muffin on the fly type.

40:59.355 --> 41:00.522
Got it.

41:00.523 --> 41:02.123
There's just somebody
I needed to bump into.

41:02.124 --> 41:04.693
Uh, yes, there is.

41:04.694 --> 41:06.127
And I wouldn't want to be

41:06.128 --> 41:08.029
Senator Morejon right now.

41:15.036 --> 41:16.538
Madam Secretary.

41:16.539 --> 41:18.773
Senator Morejon.

41:18.774 --> 41:19.975
What did you do,

41:19.976 --> 41:21.876
have the NSA track my
whereabouts or something?

41:21.877 --> 41:23.912
You Instagrammed your breakfast.

41:23.913 --> 41:25.380
Those things have Geo-tracking on them.

41:25.381 --> 41:26.581
Something to keep in mind.

41:26.582 --> 41:29.484
I wanted to touch base now that

41:29.485 --> 41:31.920
those responsible for
Bento's death have been found

41:31.921 --> 41:35.323
and you look a little
foolish for buying into

41:35.324 --> 41:36.358
an Internet conspiracy.

41:36.359 --> 41:37.659
I was just repeating a news item

41:37.660 --> 41:39.094
that one of my staffers read online.

41:39.095 --> 41:42.297
Foolishly.

41:42.298 --> 41:44.799
You're playing a more
dangerous game than you know.

41:44.800 --> 41:46.835
You played a pretty
dangerous game yourself,

41:46.836 --> 41:48.570
pulling every democratic
lever that you could

41:48.571 --> 41:50.278
to get Dalton a second term.

41:50.279 --> 41:52.652
There are still some powerful
forces in American politics

41:52.653 --> 41:54.788
who hate him for going
rogue and leaving the party.

41:54.789 --> 41:56.222
And they hate you just as much

41:56.223 --> 41:57.724
for convincing him to do it.

41:57.725 --> 42:00.827
He made his own decision,
followed his conscience.

42:00.828 --> 42:04.129
A novel approach you might
want to look into sometime.

42:05.832 --> 42:08.401
Well, here's what I know already:

42:08.402 --> 42:12.305
in this brave new world of
scattered partisan media,

42:12.306 --> 42:14.274
where unscrupulous outlets are desperate

42:14.275 --> 42:15.642
for any juicy news story

42:15.643 --> 42:17.344
and political plot
twist that they can find,

42:17.345 --> 42:20.880
I believe I can chip away
at Dalton's approval ratings

42:20.881 --> 42:22.481
quickly and efficiently.

42:23.650 --> 42:25.518
12% of the American public

42:25.519 --> 42:28.320
thinks that you're a
murderer, Madam Secretary.

42:30.790 --> 42:33.358
I can work with that.
