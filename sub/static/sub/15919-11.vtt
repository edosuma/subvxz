there is not one thing

00:45.513 --> 00:47.322
Well, thank you,

in the hot seat on that one, huh?
- (Don) Yes, you did.

00:49.657 --> 00:52.489
But for the 12 people out there
who may still have dial-up

00:52.499 --> 00:54.572

We don't make the news;

01:26.174 --> 01:29.330
How does it feel being on the other
side of that journalistic line?

01:29.340 --> 01:31.581
First of all, let me just say
that being an ugly black woman

01:31.591 --> 01:33.289
has absolutely nothing to do
with appearance.

01:33.299 --> 01:35.622
It's about the people
who feel that their voices

01:35.632 --> 01:38.039
have been stifled by society,

01:38.049 --> 01:40.913
people who are trying
to be heard,

01:40.923 --> 01:43.456
people who have had to
literally fight and scrape

01:43.466 --> 01:45.706
for every little thing that
they've been given in this life.

01:45.716 --> 01:47.205
Those people,

01:47.215 --> 01:50.122
those are the ugly black women
that I'm talking about.

01:50.132 --> 01:53.330
Regardless of race or gender
or sexual orientation,

01:53.340 --> 01:56.080
those people,
I am speaking for them,

01:56.090 --> 01:59.039
people who feel like
their stories don't matter.

01:59.049 --> 02:01.289
It's time for all of us
to stand up

02:01.299 --> 02:03.247
and demand that our voices
be heard.

02:03.257 --> 02:05.414
(Don) You are very passionate
about it, but you said "feel."

02:05.424 --> 02:07.664
Feelings aren't facts
when you're reporting the news.

02:07.674 --> 02:09.997
The fact is, there is a whole
segment of our population

02:10.007 --> 02:11.997
that feels that their stories
do not matter

02:12.007 --> 02:13.664
and that they have no voice.

02:13.674 --> 02:14.955
I'm speaking to those people.

02:14.965 --> 02:16.664
You're supposed to call that,
though,

02:16.674 --> 02:17.997
and then bring those stories
to life.

02:18.007 --> 02:20.664
But I want to ask you
about the Tea Party,

02:20.674 --> 02:22.122
the religious right.

02:22.132 --> 02:23.330
How do you respond to them

02:23.340 --> 02:25.080
calling you a racist
for calling this woman

02:25.090 --> 02:27.080
an ugly black woman
on national television?

02:27.090 --> 02:29.247
I think that the beautiful
thing about this country

02:29.257 --> 02:31.122
is that we are all entitled
to an opinion

02:31.132 --> 02:32.789
and to speak our opinions,

02:32.799 --> 02:35.372
and they are justifiably
doing that.

02:35.382 --> 02:37.789
I would also say
that there are several shows

02:37.799 --> 02:40.289
that preach
to their core values,

02:40.299 --> 02:42.289
and more power to them.

actress, author,

09:15.990 --> 09:17.996
and philanthropist
Holly Robinson Peete,

09:17.998 --> 09:21.345
whose foundation, Hollyrod,
offers help and hope to families

09:21.347 --> 09:23.406
living with autism
and Parkinson's Disease,

09:23.716 --> 09:26.039
I can't help but recall a quote
from renowned author

09:26.049 --> 09:29.330
Toni Morrison who reminds us
to make a difference

09:29.340 --> 09:32.456
about something
other than yourselves.

09:32.466 --> 09:34.289
I'm Mary Jane Paul.

09:34.299 --> 09:36.581
Thank you for listening.

09:36.591 --> 09:38.173
And we're clear.

09:39.923 --> 09:41.205
Hey.
- Oh, boy.

09:41.215 --> 09:42.289
What's up?

09:42.299 --> 09:44.039
Nothing. Everything's fine.

09:44.049 --> 09:46.080
I just had a little drama
with my folks,

09:46.090 --> 09:49.497
I may have to leave
to New York tonight.

09:49.507 --> 09:51.497
But anyway, I'm not trying
to talk about that.

09:51.507 --> 09:54.955
I want to talk about
what Her Highness had to say.

09:54.965 --> 09:57.247
Well, she thinks
that they're pushing her out

09:57.257 --> 09:59.456
and that we're next in line
to fill her time slot.

09:59.466 --> 10:00.664
I knew it. I told you.

10:00.674 --> 10:01.955
Didn't I tell you?

10:01.965 --> 10:03.830
Nobody takes off out of the blue
like that

10:03.840 --> 10:05.372
unless they're going
under the knife

10:05.382 --> 10:07.122
or they're about to get the axe.

10:07.132 --> 10:08.706
How does everyone seem to know
about this rule except for me?

10:08.716 --> 10:10.289
I don't know.
- Sorry, guys.

10:10.299 --> 10:12.080
But Greg's asking
for you two upstairs.

10:12.090 --> 10:13.913
Oh, okay, tell him
we'll be there in just a minute.

10:13.923 --> 10:16.080
Okay, and Sharay's
in his office too.

10:16.090 --> 10:17.164
Oh.

10:17.174 --> 10:18.247
What a coinkydink.

10:18.257 --> 10:20.122
Let's go.

10:20.132 --> 10:22.581
(Sharay) Let me start off
by saying congratulations

10:22.591 --> 10:24.205
on making the most
of your opportunities

10:24.215 --> 10:25.748
this past week,

10:25.758 --> 10:27.913
and though I never would have
expected one of my anchors

10:27.923 --> 10:31.997
to have the type of--Greg,
what's that phrase again?

10:32.007 --> 10:34.247
Viral impact.

10:34.257 --> 10:37.748
I swear, those words
go in one ear and out the other.

10:37.758 --> 10:39.247
Forgive my ignorance.

10:39.257 --> 10:42.913
I've never twittered
or whatever it's called.

10:42.923 --> 10:44.664
I have an account,
but apparently someone

10:44.674 --> 10:46.581
in the mailroom posts
on my behalf.

10:46.591 --> 10:48.205
It's actually in Geri Brown.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.289
She's our VP of Communications.

10:50.299 --> 10:52.080
Same difference.

10:52.090 --> 10:56.748
My point is,
I'm thrilled with all of the...

10:56.758 --> 10:58.997
Viral impact.

10:59.007 --> 11:04.247
And all of the added exposure
it's brought to this network.

11:04.257 --> 11:09.080
Before I proceed, I need to know
that I can trust the two of you.

11:09.090 --> 11:10.581
Can I trust you, Mary Jane?

11:10.591 --> 11:12.205
Yeah, of course.
- Yeah.

11:12.215 --> 11:13.748
The four people in this room

11:13.758 --> 11:16.622
are the only ones who know
what I'm about to tell you,

11:16.632 --> 11:20.955
so if it leaks out,
I'll know where it came from.

11:20.965 --> 11:24.330
That being said,
we decided to make a change.

11:24.340 --> 11:25.913
Cynthia doesn't know it yet,

11:25.923 --> 11:28.330
but these two weeks
will be her last,

11:28.340 --> 11:33.748
and it's our intention to have
the two of you replace her...

11:33.758 --> 11:36.539
assuming you want the job,
that is.

11:36.549 --> 11:38.039
(Kara) Thank you, Sharay.

11:38.049 --> 11:40.372
We most definitely want
this job; thank you.

11:40.382 --> 11:42.748
We'll be contacting your reps
to work out the details,

11:42.758 --> 11:44.748
but assuming
all goes as planned,

11:44.758 --> 11:47.913
<i>you two will be on Prime Time</i>
before you know it.

11:47.923 --> 11:50.039
Oh, my goodness.

11:50.049 --> 11:52.955
Thank you so much, Sharay,
for this vote of confidence.

11:52.965 --> 11:54.372
We really appreciate it.

11:54.382 --> 11:55.706
Thank you so much.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.039
Yeah, no,
thank you for considering us.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.080
Yes.

11:58.090 --> 11:59.706
Mary Jane,
mind sticking around?

11:59.716 --> 12:01.664
I'd like for the two of us
to chat.

12:01.674 --> 12:03.414
Absolutely.
I'll just meet you downstairs.

12:03.424 --> 12:05.164
Of course. Thanks again.

12:11.591 --> 12:13.664
(Sharay) I love your heels.

12:13.674 --> 12:15.622
I've been admiring them
since you walked in.

12:15.632 --> 12:18.080
Gucci?
- Good eye.

12:18.090 --> 12:20.247
Yeah, speaking of shoes,
if you're not careful,

12:20.257 --> 12:22.748
I will steal those
right off your feet.

12:22.758 --> 12:27.039
When I look at you,
I see so much of myself.

12:27.149 --> 12:31.264
I love how fearless
and stubborn you can be,

12:31.274 --> 12:32.848
how you know what you want

12:32.858 --> 12:35.305
and how you're willing to do
whatever it takes to get there.

12:35.315 --> 12:37.597
Well, I'm just trying to
give you the best show possible.

12:37.607 --> 12:39.556
I understand that. I do.

12:39.566 --> 12:42.013
But you've got to know
that some people

12:42.023 --> 12:45.264
are going to be threatened
by your resolve.

12:45.274 --> 12:49.806
I wasn't aware of anyone
being threatened by me.

12:49.816 --> 12:52.097
Greg's not like us,

12:52.107 --> 12:54.848
and though he's very good
at what he does,

12:54.858 --> 12:58.389
he rarely has an original idea,
so from now on,

12:58.399 --> 13:01.264
whenever he speaks, you should
assume that he's acting

13:01.274 --> 13:04.222
directly on my behalf, okay?

13:04.232 --> 13:05.848
Okay.

13:05.858 --> 13:08.472
So is this about the kind
of stories that I can do

13:08.482 --> 13:10.180
and the target demo?

13:12.315 --> 13:15.264
At the end of the day,
this is still a business,

13:15.274 --> 13:18.514
and while I'd never ask you
to stifle your creativity,

13:18.524 --> 13:21.305
since that's what makes you
who you are,

13:21.315 --> 13:24.806
<i>when it comes to Prime Time,</i>

13:24.816 --> 13:30.097
I will need you to tone down
the all-black agenda

13:30.107 --> 13:33.055
and shift your focus over
to doing some broader,

13:33.065 --> 13:35.013
more far-reaching stories.

13:35.023 --> 13:37.597
Can you do that for me?

13:37.607 --> 13:39.097
Good, so it's settled then.

13:39.107 --> 13:41.013
I'm so glad that we got to talk,

13:41.023 --> 13:43.389
and please know
if you ever need anything,

13:43.399 --> 13:45.305
my door is always open.

13:45.315 --> 13:47.097
Thank you.

14:03.023 --> 14:06.055
Make sure you keep her
on a short leash.

14:06.065 --> 14:08.013
The last thing we need
around here is to have

14:08.023 --> 14:11.013
an ugly black woman
running wild.

14:15.315 --> 14:17.806
You sure this is the best idea?

14:17.816 --> 14:19.722
No.

14:19.732 --> 14:23.097
But we have to play the hand
we've been dealt.

14:23.107 --> 14:26.264
Let's just ride
this sudden popularity of hers

14:26.274 --> 14:28.305
to a bump in ratings.

14:28.315 --> 14:30.472
It'll make the board happy.

14:30.482 --> 14:33.305
We'll get some kudos
for a diversity hire,

14:33.315 --> 14:37.264
and then
if she doesn't fall into place,

14:37.274 --> 14:39.389
we'll find someone else.

14:39.399 --> 14:40.848
That's what I need. Yep.

14:40.858 --> 14:43.556
Oh, I got to go.
I got to go. Bye.

14:43.566 --> 14:45.764
Hey, what did she say?

14:45.774 --> 14:47.639
She just wants us
to play ball.

14:47.649 --> 14:50.347
I mean,
we mainly talked about shoes.

14:52.107 --> 14:55.722
She is a smart woman.

14:55.732 --> 14:58.514
Mm-hmm, she did her research.

14:58.524 --> 14:59.848
She knows your weak spot.

14:59.858 --> 15:01.556
Yeah,
it all felt very calculated.

15:01.566 --> 15:03.347
That's because it is.

15:03.357 --> 15:06.139
What I still don't get, though,
is, why tell us about Cynthia?

15:06.149 --> 15:08.430
Testing our loyalty
or trying to create a bond.

15:08.440 --> 15:11.013
Either way,
she's definitely using us.

15:11.023 --> 15:13.264
Yeah, well,
so we're gonna use her too.

15:13.274 --> 15:16.389
And don't even think
about going to Cynthia, okay?

15:16.399 --> 15:18.139
Listen to me.

15:18.149 --> 15:21.139
We are this close to our dream
gig, baby girl, all right?

15:21.149 --> 15:22.389
So don't go screwing it up now.

15:22.399 --> 15:24.055
And what's with you today,
anyway?

15:24.065 --> 15:26.013
This is supposed
to be a really great thing.

15:26.023 --> 15:28.430
No, I know, and it's not
that I'm not excited.

15:28.440 --> 15:31.556
I am. It's just...

15:31.566 --> 15:33.681
I know that nightly news has
always been our ultimate goal,

15:33.691 --> 15:35.389
and it still very well may be,

15:35.399 --> 15:39.889
but I'm just finally doing work
that I'm really proud of.

15:39.899 --> 15:41.681
And we're being rewarded
for it.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.597
Yeah, but at what cost, Kara?

15:43.607 --> 15:45.139
I'm up to 1 million
Twitter followers

15:45.149 --> 15:47.222
ever since we started doing
the all-black stories.

15:47.232 --> 15:50.055
I know our ratings are higher
than they report to us,

15:50.065 --> 15:51.097
<i>and I know that Talk Back</i>

15:51.107 --> 15:53.639
is finally making
a real difference.

15:53.649 --> 15:55.681
Okay, well, nobody's telling you
you can't do

15:55.691 --> 15:57.514
your black-centric stories.

15:57.524 --> 15:59.681
We just, you know, we've got to
mix it up a little sometimes.

15:59.691 --> 16:01.430
Don't you see
how ridiculous that sounds?

16:01.440 --> 16:04.180
I guarantee you nobody's telling
Cynthia to do fewer white stories.

16:04.190 --> 16:07.139
No, but they still fired
her ass.

16:07.149 --> 16:09.430
Hmm?

16:09.440 --> 16:11.139
Ever since we've had
a black president,

16:11.149 --> 16:14.889
it's like now there are
generations of black kids--

16:14.899 --> 16:17.222
for the first time in history--

16:17.232 --> 16:20.389
who literally and truly believe
anything is possible.

16:20.399 --> 16:22.055
So knowing that,

16:22.065 --> 16:26.472
don't you sort of feel obligated
to give those kids a perspective

16:26.482 --> 16:29.430
of the world that they can't get
anywhere else?

16:29.440 --> 16:33.514
Well, if you don't think seeing
a black female news anchor

16:33.524 --> 16:35.764
<i>on Prime Time</i>
isn't making a difference,

16:35.774 --> 16:36.889
you're crazy.

16:36.899 --> 16:38.389
Mary Jane, look what you did.

16:38.399 --> 16:42.180
You made one comment--one--
and it went viral.

16:42.190 --> 16:43.722
You started a movement, girl.

16:43.732 --> 16:44.848
It's hardly a movement.

16:44.858 --> 16:46.347
Well, call it what you want.

16:46.357 --> 16:48.013
It sure as hell
was something huge.

16:48.023 --> 16:51.013
And yet and still
that's the very thing

16:51.023 --> 16:53.848
that Sharay wants me to change.

16:53.858 --> 16:57.013
Right now, Kara,
the possibilities are endless.

16:57.023 --> 16:59.764
I've got people calling my agent
offering me book deals,

16:59.774 --> 17:01.472
saying they want me to be
a motivation speaker

17:01.482 --> 17:03.013
for 15 grand a pop.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.806
I mean, even broadcast news
is back on the table

17:05.816 --> 17:07.597
as a realistic option again.

17:07.607 --> 17:09.430
Okay, okay, okay,
I see where this is coming from.

17:09.440 --> 17:11.012
This isn't about making
a difference.

17:11.022 --> 17:12.556
This is about making money.

17:12.566 --> 17:14.638
Why can't it be about both?

17:14.648 --> 17:16.012
I've been trying
to find my context.

17:16.022 --> 17:17.097
You know, "How do I help?"

17:17.107 --> 17:19.180
How do I make a difference?"

17:19.190 --> 17:22.097
I mean, the money--the money
just keeps me relevant.

17:22.107 --> 17:23.597
Mary Jane, I hear you.

17:23.607 --> 17:25.180
I really do.

17:25.190 --> 17:27.806
But this is a bird in a hand.

17:27.816 --> 17:30.013
I know that you're having doubts

17:30.023 --> 17:32.222
with all these opportunities
coming your way and everything,

17:32.232 --> 17:35.055
but, mama, this gig--
this one right here--

17:35.065 --> 17:38.514
could be our game-changer
for both of us.

17:38.524 --> 17:39.889
Do you know how lucky you are

17:39.899 --> 17:41.427
being on the other side
of the camera?

17:41.429 --> 17:42.442
Do you?

17:42.444 --> 17:46.556
Kara, you've got a good, what,
30 years left to do great work.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.556
We see what they're doing
to Cynthia.

17:48.566 --> 17:51.806
I got, what, 10 years tops?
- Stop.

17:51.816 --> 17:54.664
If you start thinking that way,
you're gonna make yourself crazy.

17:54.666 --> 17:57.139
Which is exactly why
I've got to take a step back

17:57.149 --> 18:00.139
and really think
everything through.

18:00.149 --> 18:02.570
And I've got to make
the best decision for--

18:03.149 --> 18:05.097
for both of us.

18:05.107 --> 18:08.013
What's gonna be best
for both of our careers?

18:09.232 --> 18:11.430
Okay.

18:11.440 --> 18:16.222
All right, just, you know,
girl, whatever you decide,

18:16.232 --> 18:20.889
just remember that we are
in this together, okay?

18:20.899 --> 18:22.430
I know.
- Please?

18:22.440 --> 18:24.764
I know. [phone chimes]

18:24.774 --> 18:26.889
Oh, shoot.
- Just get it.

18:26.899 --> 18:29.222
You know,
go take care of your family.

18:29.232 --> 18:31.848
Are you sure?
- As many times
as you've had my back?

18:31.858 --> 18:33.889
I got you.
- You call me.

18:33.899 --> 18:35.139
If anything happens,

18:35.149 --> 18:36.764
if you need anything,
you call me.

18:36.769 --> 18:38.013
I'm serious, M.J., all right?

18:38.023 --> 18:40.681
Go, go, go.
- Fine. All right.

18:40.691 --> 18:43.430
All right, mama,
I'll be back tomorrow.

18:43.440 --> 18:44.848
Okay.

18:44.858 --> 18:47.556
Bye.
- Bye.

18:47.566 --> 18:49.180
[whispering indistinctly]

19:01.401 --> 19:03.729
(Sheldon) Hey, come on in.

19:06.162 --> 19:09.569
You will not believe the day
that I have had.

19:09.579 --> 19:11.527
Oh, and hello to you too.

19:11.537 --> 19:12.819
Sorry.

19:12.829 --> 19:14.319
Hi.
- Hi.

19:14.329 --> 19:16.444
So last week
wasn't a temporary thing.

19:16.454 --> 19:18.985
They officially offered me
Cynthia's job today.

19:18.995 --> 19:20.194
Wow.

19:20.204 --> 19:22.985
And last week,
I would've been overjoyed

19:22.995 --> 19:26.152
and jumped at the chance,
but I don't know.

19:26.162 --> 19:29.819
Right now, I just sort of
feel like I'm selling out.

19:29.829 --> 19:32.277
You know?

19:32.287 --> 19:33.277
Wow.

19:33.287 --> 19:35.736
Okay.

19:35.746 --> 19:37.152
What's all this?

19:37.162 --> 19:39.943
Yeah, I was thinking tonight
we would try Moroccan.

19:39.953 --> 19:41.402
Uh, you were thinking tonight
we would try

19:41.412 --> 19:42.819
all kinds of things.

19:42.829 --> 19:44.819
Well, it's one step at a time.

19:44.829 --> 19:46.694
Something smells so good.

19:46.704 --> 19:48.319
Oh, it's saffron in the rice.

19:48.329 --> 19:50.527
Oh.

19:50.537 --> 19:52.360
Make yourself comfortable.

19:52.370 --> 19:53.902
Pour yourself a drink,

19:53.912 --> 19:56.611
and I'm going to go
put on some music.

19:56.621 --> 19:59.860
Nice.

20:02.079 --> 20:04.527
All right,
they showed me how to do this.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.652
You all right over there?

20:05.662 --> 20:07.110
(Sheldon)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:07.120 --> 20:09.152
Um, I had this guy
come over last week

20:09.162 --> 20:12.319
to install a new stereo,
and he showed me how to do it,

20:12.329 --> 20:15.444
and I just don't remember
what he did.

20:15.454 --> 20:17.069
(Mary Jane) You want
me to come look at it?

20:17.079 --> 20:18.194
I think I got it.

20:18.204 --> 20:20.819
Let me see this.

20:20.829 --> 20:22.277
Something in here.

20:22.287 --> 20:23.778
(Mary Jane) Is that why
you dated younger girls?

20:23.788 --> 20:26.194
So they could come over
and read the fine print?

20:26.204 --> 20:28.402
You got jokes.

20:28.412 --> 20:30.110
That should be it.

20:30.120 --> 20:31.319
Come on!

20:31.329 --> 20:33.611
What about...

20:33.621 --> 20:35.778
[loud music] Oh, okay.

20:35.788 --> 20:37.486
I'm sorry. I'm--I'm sorry.

20:37.496 --> 20:39.694
(Mary Jane) Yeah.

20:39.704 --> 20:41.778
(Sheldon) I'm sorry.

20:41.788 --> 20:43.402
You all right, chief?

20:43.412 --> 20:45.110
(Sheldon) Yeah, I--I got it.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.819
I--it's something that he
told me to push the one and...

20:52.245 --> 20:53.611
Nice, huh?

20:53.621 --> 20:55.110
I'm sorry about all that.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.943
No.

20:57.953 --> 21:02.736
You sure put forth a lot
of effort tonight.

21:02.746 --> 21:04.527
Any particular reason?

21:04.537 --> 21:06.778
No. How do you mean?

21:06.788 --> 21:08.819
Oh, I don't know,
the candles,

21:08.829 --> 21:11.985
the slow jams. the saffron.

21:11.995 --> 21:13.943
[chuckles]

21:13.953 --> 21:17.360
No, I just figure we'd have
a nice meal,

21:17.370 --> 21:19.360
some nice wine,

21:19.370 --> 21:21.569
and afterwards,
if you're up for it,

21:21.579 --> 21:25.527
we could check out a film.

21:27.788 --> 21:30.402
[laughs]

21:30.412 --> 21:32.943
What's so funny?

21:32.953 --> 21:35.069
Nothing, these DVDs
remind me of something.

21:35.079 --> 21:37.152
It's nothing, really.

21:37.162 --> 21:41.194
Doesn't seem like nothing.

21:41.204 --> 21:44.444
Okay, I have seen the whole
French film move done to death.

21:44.454 --> 21:45.943
I've used it myself.

21:45.953 --> 21:48.319
Um, but yeah,
it's--it's no big deal.

21:48.329 --> 21:49.527
That's not a move.

21:49.537 --> 21:51.110
It was, you know,

21:51.120 --> 21:52.943
you seem like a person
who likes foreign films.

21:52.953 --> 21:54.819
Oh, do I? Really?

21:54.829 --> 21:56.486
Yeah.

21:56.496 --> 21:58.652
You don't think we're a little
too old to be playing games?

21:58.662 --> 21:59.652
I mean, come on.

21:59.662 --> 22:02.110
I'm not playing anything.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.569
Look, if you don't want
to see the damn film,

22:04.579 --> 22:05.736
I couldn't care less, really.

22:05.746 --> 22:07.444
Okay, calm down.

22:07.454 --> 22:08.985
Pump the brakes.

22:08.995 --> 22:13.569
I'm just saying
that this is really, I mean--

22:13.579 --> 22:17.611
and you have to admit,
all of this is--it's a lot.

22:17.621 --> 22:18.778
It's a whole hell of a lot,

22:18.788 --> 22:21.319
and I'm sure
to the 25-year-olds,

22:21.329 --> 22:23.152
this stuff works wonders.

22:23.162 --> 22:25.611
I mean, it's a panty-dropper
move, so I get it.

22:25.621 --> 22:27.652
But to me,

22:27.662 --> 22:30.694
it's just coming across...

22:30.704 --> 22:33.319
corny.

22:35.621 --> 22:37.194
Oh, jeez. Now you're mad.

22:37.204 --> 22:39.235
Not my intention.
It's no big deal.

22:39.245 --> 22:41.194
I think you're just
taking it the wrong way.

22:41.204 --> 22:42.778
You know?

22:42.788 --> 22:45.569
It's just dinner and a movie,
Mary Jane.

22:45.579 --> 22:46.943
And I appreciate it.

22:46.953 --> 22:49.527
I totally appreciate it.

22:49.537 --> 22:51.527
It's just a bit much.

22:52.829 --> 22:54.652
That's fine.

22:54.662 --> 22:57.110
It's all good.

22:57.120 --> 22:59.736
I get it.

23:03.162 --> 23:06.152
(Mark) You have no idea that this
is entirely your fault, do you?

23:06.162 --> 23:07.611
Entirely?
- Yeah.

23:07.621 --> 23:09.277
I think that's a bit
of a stretch.

23:09.287 --> 23:11.277
It's not my fault the man
is sensitive salad.

23:11.287 --> 23:12.985
What? Mary Jane, come on.

23:12.995 --> 23:14.778
Are you kidding me?
You called the man corny.

23:14.788 --> 23:16.569
I mean, what the hell
did you expect to happen?

23:16.579 --> 23:19.444
I assumed he would have taken it
as constructive criticism.

23:19.454 --> 23:21.985
Oh, please, Mary Jane.

23:21.995 --> 23:25.694
A man goes out of his way to
plan a romantic dinner for you.

23:25.704 --> 23:29.943
Constructive or not, that was
not gonna ever end well.

23:29.953 --> 23:31.694
No, I think you're making
too big of a deal out of it.

23:31.704 --> 23:33.319
It wasn't that bad.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.444
Yeah, that's probably why
you guys sat in silence

23:35.454 --> 23:36.652
for the rest of the night.

23:36.662 --> 23:38.152
You're right.
I'm an awful person.

23:38.162 --> 23:39.486
Oh, see, I didn't say--
I didn't say all of that.

23:39.496 --> 23:40.778
No, I'm an awful person.
I'm an awful person.

23:40.788 --> 23:42.402
Okay, maybe misguided,
but see,

23:42.412 --> 23:44.152
what it is is that you women
don't realize it,

23:44.162 --> 23:46.486
but your words have the power
to either lift a man up

23:46.496 --> 23:48.194
or to crush his spirit,

23:48.204 --> 23:51.069
especially when someone likes you
enough to go to that kind of effort.

23:51.079 --> 23:52.360
Thank you. Thank you.

23:52.370 --> 23:54.235
Please, enough.

23:54.245 --> 23:57.943
Okay, so, what is the likelihood
that this whole thing

23:57.953 --> 23:59.943
just might blow over?

23:59.953 --> 24:01.527
I mean, that could happen.
- It could.

24:01.537 --> 24:02.943
I don't know, Mary Jane.

24:02.953 --> 24:06.235
It's all dependent
on the person, I guess.

24:06.245 --> 24:09.736
You know, there was
this guy back in college,

24:09.746 --> 24:10.652
Donovan Rossi.

24:10.662 --> 24:11.778
Oh.
- Mmm.

24:11.788 --> 24:14.194
We're in my room making out.

24:14.204 --> 24:17.611
Now, we didn't really know
what the hell we were doing.

24:17.621 --> 24:19.110
It was all kind of awkward.

24:19.120 --> 24:21.235
Now, at this point,
I had already been with a woman,

24:21.245 --> 24:22.486
but I had never been
with a guy--

24:22.496 --> 24:23.527
Whoa, okay. Hold up.
- What?

24:23.537 --> 24:25.444
Pause Pause.

24:25.454 --> 24:29.194
Okay, how did I not know
that you'd slept

24:29.204 --> 24:30.360
with a freaking woman?

24:30.370 --> 24:32.027
Hey.
- Okay.

24:32.037 --> 24:34.069
And now that I do know, oh,
it's blowing my mind.

24:34.079 --> 24:35.985
Girl.
- Okay, that's all.

24:35.995 --> 24:37.694
Back to you.
- Okay.

24:37.704 --> 24:39.194
You were making out.
- Doing our thing.

24:39.204 --> 24:40.778
So things started to heat up.
- Mm-hmm.

24:40.788 --> 24:42.277
Clothes started coming off,

24:42.287 --> 24:46.402
and then there I am standing
in front of him buck naked,

24:46.412 --> 24:48.652
and he starts to laugh.

24:48.662 --> 24:50.360
Oh, damn.
- Oh, my gosh.

24:50.370 --> 24:52.527
And before I knew it,
he ran out of the room,

24:52.537 --> 24:54.277
and we never spoke again.

24:54.287 --> 24:55.360
It's 'cause you were like...

24:55.370 --> 24:56.486
Oh, please, child.

24:56.496 --> 24:59.819
My point is, in that moment,

24:59.829 --> 25:02.486
Donovan realized
that he wasn't gay.

25:02.496 --> 25:05.611
And he just freaked out.

25:05.621 --> 25:07.611
That poor guy. Jeez.

25:07.621 --> 25:10.943
What do you mean, poor guy?

25:10.953 --> 25:15.110
Mary Jane, look, okay,
in that moment,

25:15.120 --> 25:17.444
no matter how many times
I play it over in my head,

25:17.454 --> 25:19.027
I can never forget it.

25:19.037 --> 25:21.527
The whole point of me
baring my soul to you

25:21.537 --> 25:24.152
is to show you the depth
of what Sheldon may be feeling

25:24.162 --> 25:26.569
after you laughed in his face

25:26.579 --> 25:31.027
and that are were
two sides--always--to a story.

25:31.037 --> 25:32.943
It couldn't be that bad,
could it?

25:32.953 --> 25:34.152
I mean, I don't know.

25:34.162 --> 25:35.943
Apparently neither do you.

25:35.953 --> 25:38.486
So, what do I do now?

25:38.496 --> 25:40.110
I'd reach out to him.

25:40.120 --> 25:43.319
You know, hit it,
and hit it hard.

25:43.329 --> 25:46.694
Pun intended?

25:46.704 --> 25:47.943
You know,
you can laugh it off,

25:47.953 --> 25:49.527
avoid this if you want to,

25:49.537 --> 25:52.943
but drawing off
of my own experience,

25:52.953 --> 25:57.194
I'd say that the more time
that passes by,

25:57.204 --> 26:00.652
the harder it is to recover.

26:00.662 --> 26:03.819
(man) A capacity crowd here
at home tonight as the Knicks

26:03.829 --> 26:06.360
are back on familiar territory
for one game.

26:06.370 --> 26:08.943
Quite a bit on the line as
they've been struggling of late.

26:21.829 --> 26:24.486
Hello, I'm here.

26:24.496 --> 26:25.486
Hi, Ma.

26:25.496 --> 26:27.152
What are you doing here?

26:27.162 --> 26:28.943
(Kara) How you doing?

26:28.953 --> 26:30.486
I thought you said
you were gonna call

26:30.496 --> 26:31.778
when your flight landed?

26:31.788 --> 26:34.360
Aww, no, it's easier for me
to catch a cab.

26:34.370 --> 26:35.943
How are you?

26:35.953 --> 26:37.444
Oh, look at you.

26:37.454 --> 26:39.069
You look good.
Skinny but good.

26:39.079 --> 26:40.444
Thank you. I--stop.

26:40.454 --> 26:42.694
I do not. Hey, pop.

26:42.704 --> 26:44.069
Hector.

26:44.079 --> 26:45.527
Please pause the game, huh?

26:45.537 --> 26:47.235
Get up. Come on. Say hello.
- It's all right.

26:47.245 --> 26:48.569
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
Don't get up, pop.

26:48.579 --> 26:50.235
How you doing?

26:50.245 --> 26:51.444
Good to see you.

26:51.454 --> 26:52.985
Better than some,
worse than others.

26:52.995 --> 26:54.943
You know how it is.

26:54.953 --> 26:56.486
Hey, how 'bout those Knicks,
huh?

26:56.496 --> 26:58.652
You think Phil Jackson'll
bring us the championship?

26:58.662 --> 27:01.444
Only if he gets his ass back
on the bench where he belongs.

27:01.454 --> 27:02.736
We got Derek Fisher.

27:02.746 --> 27:05.527
He's a Laker.
- Oh, brother.

27:05.537 --> 27:07.444
Hey, hey, hey,
are you hungry?

27:07.454 --> 27:09.444
No, no, no, actually,
I got something on the plane.

27:09.454 --> 27:11.235
You look hungry.
- Ay, stop it.

27:11.245 --> 27:13.194
Come on.
- You look good, Ma.

27:13.204 --> 27:14.652
Okay, come on.
Keep me company, huh?

27:14.662 --> 27:16.235
How you been?

27:18.496 --> 27:20.943
So how long you get
to stay this time?

27:20.953 --> 27:25.110
Probably just go overnight,
unfortunately.

27:25.120 --> 27:28.778
So, Ma, when are you gonna
tell me what is going on?

27:28.788 --> 27:30.985
You've texted me,
like, 14 times.

27:30.995 --> 27:33.694
And each one was more cryptic
than the other.

27:33.704 --> 27:35.152
(man)
You've got to be kidding me.

27:35.162 --> 27:37.319
Come on.

27:37.329 --> 27:41.402
Every day, all he does
is scream at that TV.

27:41.412 --> 27:44.152
Oh, a few weeks ago,

27:44.162 --> 27:46.694
okay, he comes and he tells me
that we're moving to a condo...

27:46.704 --> 27:48.110
What?

27:48.120 --> 27:50.235
That we're selling the house.

27:50.245 --> 27:51.943
Can you believe that crap?

27:51.953 --> 27:53.819
No, no,
that doesn't make any sense.

27:53.829 --> 27:55.819
Yeah, out of nowhere.
Just like that.

27:55.829 --> 27:57.736
There's got to be some kind
of explanation.

27:57.746 --> 28:00.694
Yeah, well, if you can find it,
all right, you tell me.

28:00.704 --> 28:04.235
Because he's like talking
to a wall.

28:04.245 --> 28:05.444
Papí?
- Oh.

28:05.454 --> 28:08.943
And that one is not much better.

28:10.537 --> 28:11.819
Kare bear.

28:11.829 --> 28:14.027
(Kara) Hi, Lily pad.

28:14.037 --> 28:15.985
How are you doing?
- I heard that you were coming.

28:15.995 --> 28:17.611
But I had to see it
with my own two eyes.

28:17.621 --> 28:19.360
Oh, my goodness.
- Hi.

28:19.370 --> 28:20.943
Ooh, my goodness.

28:20.953 --> 28:22.527
Hi, Mom.
- You look beautiful.

28:22.537 --> 28:23.569
Oh, my goodness.

28:23.579 --> 28:24.943
What is this? Nice.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.110
Did Daddy buy this for you?

28:26.120 --> 28:28.943
Yeah, yeah, a while back.

28:28.953 --> 28:30.943
Is that why you're always
defending him,

28:30.953 --> 28:32.527
'cause he buys you nice gifts?

28:32.537 --> 28:34.778
It's a knockoff, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

28:34.788 --> 28:36.069
And you should talk.

28:36.079 --> 28:37.985
That outfit probably cost
more than my rent.

28:37.995 --> 28:39.943
Yeah, well, the difference is,
I paid for this myself.

28:39.953 --> 28:43.110
Enough, both of you, huh?

28:43.120 --> 28:45.360
If you're here to try to talk
them out of selling the house--

28:45.370 --> 28:47.152
Wait, you mean him.

28:47.162 --> 28:50.569
And in what universe is it
a good idea to sell this house?

28:50.579 --> 28:52.319
Actually, the way the market
is rebounding,

28:52.329 --> 28:53.943
it's a really good time
to sell, Ma.

28:53.953 --> 28:56.943
What? Since when are you
a real estate expert?

28:56.953 --> 28:59.569
Last I heard, you were
an unemployed hairdresser.

28:59.579 --> 29:01.943
You're not here 10 minutes,
and you're already criticizing

29:01.953 --> 29:03.819
and trying to take control
of everything.

29:03.829 --> 29:06.694
Big surprise.
- Okay, you listen to me, okay?

29:06.704 --> 29:09.611
Kara's here
because I asked her to come.

29:09.621 --> 29:12.569
I am tired of you and your dad
ganging up on me.

29:12.579 --> 29:14.985
Ma--
- No, shh.

29:14.995 --> 29:19.985
I don't care what the market
looks like, huh?

29:19.995 --> 29:23.943
I am not selling my house,
and that's final.

29:30.204 --> 29:33.319
Lily, how could you possibly
be siding with him on this?

29:33.329 --> 29:35.819
Seriously, they've lived here
for, like, 40 fricking years.

29:35.829 --> 29:37.486
And how could you not?

29:37.496 --> 29:39.069
This place is practically
falling apart.

29:39.079 --> 29:40.694
Who cares?
- So what?

29:40.704 --> 29:43.194
Mamí worked her ass off to keep
this roof over our heads.

29:43.204 --> 29:45.194
You act like she paid
for the place all on her own.

29:45.204 --> 29:47.277
Because she practically did.
- Why would you even say that?

29:47.287 --> 29:49.486
(man) Try making a
shot, why don't you?

29:49.496 --> 29:51.943
God.
- Oh, my God.

29:51.953 --> 29:53.527
Forget it. Never mind.

29:58.245 --> 30:00.402
I really miss you. I do.

30:00.412 --> 30:03.402
I really do miss you very much.

30:03.412 --> 30:05.152
Yeah.

30:05.162 --> 30:07.569
Well, it's not like
we don't talk; we talk.

30:07.579 --> 30:08.902
Yeah, but it's not the same.

30:08.912 --> 30:10.652
It's not.

30:10.662 --> 30:13.611
Why didn't you call me
about this house stuff?

30:13.621 --> 30:15.736
Because I knew that you
were gonna try to come

30:15.746 --> 30:17.069
and save the day.

30:17.079 --> 30:19.235
Well--
- Just leave it alone.

30:19.245 --> 30:21.694
Daddy promised me
that it's gonna be all right.

30:21.704 --> 30:24.402
(man) They've dug a deep hole
for themselves to dig out of.

30:24.412 --> 30:28.819
And honestly, there's just not
that many shovels in New York.

30:31.621 --> 30:32.860
Oh, my God.

30:49.496 --> 30:51.682
Wait, Mark. Hey, Help.

30:51.684 --> 30:53.385
What did you do now?

30:53.387 --> 30:55.721
I swear I have tried to write
this text, like,

30:55.723 --> 30:57.510
a million times.

30:59.546 --> 31:02.369
Oh, yeah.
You're trying too hard.

31:02.379 --> 31:03.496
What about this last part?

31:03.498 --> 31:06.676
Is that true about you,
uh, having him in your life?

31:07.571 --> 31:09.102
Yeah. I mean, for now, I guess.

31:09.112 --> 31:11.060
I mean, I just met him,
so... kind of?

31:11.070 --> 31:12.893
Okay, let's see.

31:17.612 --> 31:19.477
How about something like this?

31:24.404 --> 31:27.060
This is so perfect that
I almost hate you right now.

31:27.070 --> 31:28.310
You know you love me.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.602
Glad I could help.

31:29.612 --> 31:31.352
Wait, wait, so now what?

31:31.362 --> 31:33.602
Now we just wait.

31:33.612 --> 31:37.602
[laughs]

31:37.612 --> 31:38.893
[exhales]

31:38.903 --> 31:40.893
(Kara) Hey, Pop.

31:40.903 --> 31:43.477
Hey.

31:43.487 --> 31:45.019
It's really coming down, huh?

31:45.029 --> 31:48.310
Mm.
- Oh, my goodness.

31:48.320 --> 31:50.019
I hope they don't cancel
my flight.

31:50.029 --> 31:52.893
[chuckles]

31:56.112 --> 31:59.269
So, Pop...

31:59.279 --> 32:01.769
how bad is it?

32:01.779 --> 32:04.477
What are you talking about?

32:04.487 --> 32:07.019
Things are good.

32:09.945 --> 32:15.019
You know, it's so crazy
how being away

32:15.029 --> 32:16.728
gives you such clarity.

32:16.738 --> 32:18.310
About what?

32:18.320 --> 32:20.185
How much you hate me?

32:20.195 --> 32:21.893
Hate you?

32:21.903 --> 32:23.436
You actually think I hate you,
Papí?

32:23.446 --> 32:24.893
That's--I don't hate you.

32:24.903 --> 32:27.227
I don't see you
coming around very often.

32:27.237 --> 32:28.935
Papí,
that's because I work too much.

32:28.945 --> 32:31.893
That's it. Nothing else.

32:31.903 --> 32:33.644
At least you're getting paid.

32:33.654 --> 32:36.310
Oh...

32:36.320 --> 32:40.185
God...

32:40.195 --> 32:42.769
It's so amazing how much
you and I are so alike.

32:42.779 --> 32:44.935
Boy, we hate to lose.

32:44.945 --> 32:46.977
No matter what obstacle
gets in our way,

32:46.987 --> 32:51.352
we just keep plowing forward
until we find a way to win.

32:51.362 --> 32:54.436
Even if it means hurting
other people in the process.

32:54.446 --> 32:56.893
You never lost a day
in your life.

32:56.903 --> 32:58.394
Really?

32:58.404 --> 33:00.893
How about the fact that I gave
so much of myself at work

33:00.903 --> 33:04.686
that I lost everything
that I value?

33:04.696 --> 33:08.060
I lost my marriage, my kids,

33:08.070 --> 33:10.436
I never get to see
you guys anymore.

33:10.446 --> 33:15.477
Trust me, I've lost plenty.

33:15.487 --> 33:19.060
And you know what else
we have in common, Papí?

33:19.070 --> 33:22.185
We always think we can do
everything by ourselves,

33:22.195 --> 33:25.602
and the truth is that we can't.

33:25.612 --> 33:31.060
So why don't you do me a favor
and put your pride aside

33:31.070 --> 33:33.019
and just give me a number,
and let me write a check,

33:33.029 --> 33:35.144
and Mamí never has to know
anything about this.

33:38.529 --> 33:39.977
Papí, just give me a number.

33:39.987 --> 33:41.602
I don't care what it takes.

33:41.612 --> 33:43.519
I will do anything to keep
you guys in this house for good.

33:43.529 --> 33:45.686
I want to help you.

33:45.696 --> 33:47.436
It's already too late
for that.

33:47.446 --> 33:49.602
What do you mean?

33:49.612 --> 33:52.728
I had to sign the deed over
to Johnny B. a few months ago.

33:52.738 --> 33:56.019
Oh, no, you didn't.

33:56.029 --> 33:57.602
Why didn't you come to me?

33:57.612 --> 33:59.893
Would you ever ask your kids
for money?

33:59.903 --> 34:01.060
What does that mean?

34:01.070 --> 34:04.893
Besides, it just...

34:04.903 --> 34:06.728
it snowballed.

34:06.738 --> 34:08.893
Before I knew it,
I was in so deep,

34:08.902 --> 34:10.686
I couldn't get out
from under the vig,

34:10.696 --> 34:12.561
let alone the principal.

34:16.446 --> 34:20.436
So if you already lost
the house, what are you doing?

34:20.446 --> 34:23.436
I've been paying Johnny B. rent,

34:23.446 --> 34:27.436
pulling from our savings
so your mamí wouldn't know.

34:27.446 --> 34:32.018
But now, even that's
just about tapped out.

34:32.029 --> 34:35.101
And I can't bring
myself to tell her.

34:35.112 --> 34:36.893
Okay?

34:36.902 --> 34:38.351
Oh, my God.

34:45.362 --> 34:49.893
Oh, God.

34:58.953 --> 35:00.703
[phone chimes]

35:03.696 --> 35:06.728
[toilet flushes]

35:19.903 --> 35:21.935
Well, I won't ask you
what she said.

35:21.945 --> 35:23.845
This way, you don't have to lie
to my face.

35:25.195 --> 35:26.728
How did you find out?

35:27.353 --> 35:30.060
In this business, when people
start to be overly nice to you,

35:30.070 --> 35:32.728
that's when you have to start
watching your back.

35:43.062 --> 35:46.527
If you fly at all, you know
the routine at airport security.

35:46.529 --> 35:47.885
Take off your shoes...

35:47.887 --> 35:51.202
(Mary Jane) So what, you're just gonna
pay their rent for a little while?

35:51.370 --> 35:52.724
How can you even afford that?

35:52.726 --> 35:53.826
I can't.

35:53.828 --> 35:55.200
I can't.

35:55.202 --> 35:58.319
I just... [exhales]

35:58.329 --> 35:59.743
Sometimes you've just got to
suck it up

35:59.745 --> 36:01.630
and do whatever you got to do.

36:03.245 --> 36:05.251
I've never seen my dad
like that.

36:07.162 --> 36:08.652
And I'm telling you,
I would just--

36:08.662 --> 36:10.882
I'd do just about anything
for my mom,

36:10.884 --> 36:14.444
anything just for her not to
have to deal with any of this.

36:16.370 --> 36:18.194
Oh, boy.

36:22.824 --> 36:23.925
Well,

36:24.529 --> 36:27.066
I guess my kid's gonna
have to go to public school now.

36:29.788 --> 36:31.819
<i>I bet that Prime Time bump</i>
in your paycheck,

36:31.829 --> 36:33.235
that'll help out a little bit.

36:33.245 --> 36:35.360
Absolutely.

36:35.370 --> 36:37.736
Cheers to that.

36:37.746 --> 36:39.402
Cheers.

the fence at the...

(Kara) It's hard to believe that's
gonna be you in a few weeks.

36:50.120 --> 36:52.194
Let's make sure
our deals close first

36:52.204 --> 36:54.819
before we start to celebrate
too much.

36:57.329 --> 36:59.444
What made you
change your mind, anyway?

36:59.454 --> 37:01.736
I mean, not that
I'm complaining, of course.

37:01.746 --> 37:04.152
I spent so much of my life
moving from dream to dream

37:04.162 --> 37:07.027
and climbing
the corporate ladder

37:07.037 --> 37:09.985
and racing towards
an imaginary finish line

37:09.995 --> 37:13.194
that come to find out
might not even exist.

37:13.204 --> 37:16.402
I just...

37:16.412 --> 37:19.152
I just wanted to enjoy where
I was at for once, you know?

37:19.162 --> 37:20.611
Right.

37:20.621 --> 37:24.402
And like it or not,
where I'm at is right here

37:24.412 --> 37:25.943
being offered a promotion.

37:27.662 --> 37:29.486
Not a bad place to be.

37:29.496 --> 37:31.110
Not a bad place to be.

37:31.120 --> 37:33.943
[laughs]

37:36.579 --> 37:38.444
(Mary Jane) Look at her.

37:38.454 --> 37:40.069
She's such a pro.

37:40.079 --> 37:42.652
My God, you would have no idea
she's on her way out.

37:44.496 --> 37:45.694
Tough biz we're in.

37:45.704 --> 37:48.736
Just goes to show,

37:48.746 --> 37:50.694
you never know what people
are going through.

37:50.704 --> 37:51.694
(Kara) Right?

37:51.704 --> 37:56.277
[phone chimes]

37:56.287 --> 37:58.027
(Mary Jane)
What the hell is this?

37:58.037 --> 38:00.985
(Mark) I don't really
see the confusion.

38:00.995 --> 38:03.652
Don't you think
it's a little formal,

38:03.662 --> 38:06.277
his use of the period that way?

38:06.287 --> 38:08.527
I mean, why not use dashes
or ellipses?

38:08.537 --> 38:10.486
Like, maybe there's more
to come.

38:10.496 --> 38:11.527
Give a girl some hope.

38:11.537 --> 38:13.277
Maybe there isn't.

38:13.287 --> 38:15.943
Maybe you should be preparing
yourself for that possibility.

38:15.953 --> 38:18.943
And it's just so cryptic
in its simplicity.

38:18.953 --> 38:20.943

Well,

Everything that man does
has a purpose,

and he did this precisely
because he knew

38:30.204 --> 38:32.486
it would drive me crazy,
and it's driving me crazy.

I mean, really?

38:34.079 --> 38:37.235
It takes 24 hours to write,

39:22.953 --> 39:25.152
Well, you know,

39:25.162 --> 39:28.319

to make you feel

39:28.329 --> 39:31.569
any kind of way.

39:31.579 --> 39:34.486
I'll call you tomorrow.

39:34.496 --> 39:36.069
Oh.

39:36.079 --> 39:39.444
Sure, yeah.
I'll--I'll just go.
