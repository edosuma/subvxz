08:58.579 --> 09:00.332
together for three years.

09:00.374 --> 09:02.876
And now you're

09:00.374 --> 09:02.876
committed to your music.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.462
I'm going back

09:02.917 --> 09:05.462
to my comedy full-time.

09:05.504 --> 09:07.839
It's the end of an era.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.883
I'll miss you, man!

09:09.924 --> 09:12.302
Joey, Joey, please! Joseph!

09:12.344 --> 09:14.762
Get a grip, okay?

09:12.344 --> 09:14.762
We-we live in the same house.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.515
We'll see each other,

09:14.804 --> 09:16.515
now now run along upstairs.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.891
The red light is on that means

09:17.932 --> 09:19.309
I'm not to be disturbed.

09:19.351 --> 09:21.769
Go, go, go, I love you.

09:19.351 --> 09:21.769
I miss you. Go ahead. Go..

09:21.811 --> 09:24.731
Okay, fine.

09:21.811 --> 09:24.731
I can take a hint.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.774
I have a very full

09:24.772 --> 09:26.774
and busy life of my own.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.736
I'll just go upstairs,

09:26.816 --> 09:29.736
make some nachos.

09:29.777 --> 09:32.947
Get ready

09:29.777 --> 09:32.947
for a little "Yogi Bear".

09:39.454 --> 09:42.332
Uh, Jess, there's

09:39.454 --> 09:42.332
one little problem.

09:42.374 --> 09:45.043
This doorknob came off

09:42.374 --> 09:45.043
right in my hand.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.878
That's impossible.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.878
I installed it myself.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.256
- Well, that explains it.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.256
- Give me that.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.515
It's stripped.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.515
We're locked in here.

09:58.557 --> 10:00.016
Well, we'll just yell for help.

10:00.058 --> 10:01.851
Did you soundproof

10:00.058 --> 10:01.851
this room yourself?

10:01.893 --> 10:03.644
- Yeah.

10:01.893 --> 10:03.644
- Then they'll hear us.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.647
- Hey, Becky.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.647
- 'Hey.'

10:06.689 --> 10:08.942
- The guys downstairs?

10:06.689 --> 10:08.942
- Yeah, oh, wait.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.069
The red light's on

10:08.983 --> 10:11.069
that means they're recording.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.488
- 'Help!'

10:13.530 --> 10:15.532
- 'Help!'

10:15.574 --> 10:17.242
They're doing

10:15.574 --> 10:17.242
the Beatles song, "Help".

10:20.912 --> 10:22.372
Oh, man.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.665
I could use some help myself.

10:24.707 --> 10:28.128
D.J.'s having a mega crisis and

10:24.707 --> 10:28.128
she won't talk to me about it.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.546
Well, if she won't talk

10:28.169 --> 10:29.546
to you how do you know

10:29.588 --> 10:31.923
she's having a mega crisis?

10:31.965 --> 10:35.343
Oh, well, I-I kind of

10:31.965 --> 10:35.343
sort of saw this card

10:35.385 --> 10:38.638
in her sock drawer when I was

10:35.385 --> 10:38.638
putting away the laundry.

10:38.679 --> 10:40.765
It's not Monday.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.684
Okay, I was snooping.

10:43.726 --> 10:46.771
But it's driving me nuts

10:43.726 --> 10:46.771
that she won't talk to me.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.565
I'll see you later, dad.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.565
I'm going over to Kimmy's.

10:48.607 --> 10:51.692
Uh, wait,

10:48.607 --> 10:51.692
before you go, honey..

10:51.734 --> 10:53.612
Look, uh..

10:53.653 --> 10:55.780
I have this feeling

10:53.653 --> 10:55.780
that you've got a problem

10:55.822 --> 10:58.199
and you're not

10:55.822 --> 10:58.199
sharing with me.

10:58.241 --> 10:59.784
Dad, there's no problem.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.828
Kimmy, do I have a problem?

11:01.869 --> 11:04.831
Well, your dad

11:01.869 --> 11:04.831
is kind of nosy.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.378
Look, dad, I'm fine, really.

11:10.420 --> 11:11.921
I got to run. Bye.

11:11.963 --> 11:13.881
Bye.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.426
Did you see that?

11:16.468 --> 11:18.428
She lied right to my face.

11:18.470 --> 11:21.764
Well, I hate to get technical

11:18.470 --> 11:21.764
but you lied, too.

11:21.806 --> 11:24.934
You never mentioned your

11:21.806 --> 11:24.934
little raid on her sock drawer.

11:24.976 --> 11:27.854
[sighing]

11:24.976 --> 11:27.854
What's happening to me and D.J.?

11:27.895 --> 11:30.398
We used to be so close.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.733
Becky, I feel like

11:30.440 --> 11:32.733
I'm losing my little girl.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.611
[melancholic music]

11:39.533 --> 11:41.117
Kimmy, we need a plan.

11:41.159 --> 11:44.371
We have to get people

11:41.159 --> 11:44.371
to stop saying I'm a bad kisser.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.873
I got it, just make out

11:44.412 --> 11:46.873
with every guy at school

11:46.914 --> 11:48.958
until they change their mind.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.879
Deej, wait a second, um..

11:52.920 --> 11:55.215
Look, I was just thinking.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.300
You and I hardly have

11:55.256 --> 11:57.300
any time to hang out anymore.

11:57.342 --> 12:00.178
What do you say

11:57.342 --> 12:00.178
we, uh, hang out tonight?

12:00.220 --> 12:01.971
Dad, I can't

12:00.220 --> 12:01.971
just hang out with you.

12:02.013 --> 12:03.598
Kimmy and I have plans.

12:03.640 --> 12:04.891
To do what?

12:04.932 --> 12:06.643
To hang out.

12:06.685 --> 12:09.354
Oh, come on, why don't

12:06.685 --> 12:09.354
you hang out with your dad?

12:09.396 --> 12:11.064
You know, it would be

12:09.396 --> 12:11.064
totally a blast.

12:11.105 --> 12:13.149
We'd go bowling.

12:11.105 --> 12:13.149
Phew..

12:14.609 --> 12:17.195
Gee, Mr. T.,

12:14.609 --> 12:17.195
that sounds nifty!

12:17.237 --> 12:18.863
Are Wally and the Beav

12:17.237 --> 12:18.863
coming, too?

12:23.660 --> 12:26.745
Oops. One step too far.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.165
Later, Deej.

12:31.792 --> 12:34.795
Dad, I haven't been bowling

12:31.792 --> 12:34.795
since my 7th birthday.

12:34.837 --> 12:37.340
Yeah, and you loved it.

12:37.382 --> 12:39.967
Okay, dad, if it means that

12:37.382 --> 12:39.967
much to you, let's go bowling.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.803
That's my girl,

12:40.009 --> 12:42.803
just let me get my ball

18:11.674 --> 18:13.009
Thanks for understanding.

18:13.051 --> 18:14.719
You're the best, dad.

18:13.051 --> 18:14.719
I won't be out too late.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.014
This is so much fun.

Yeah, fine.

Uh...Deej,

19:00.807 --> 19:02.349
don't you think

19:02.391 --> 19:04.560
we should talk?

19:04.602 --> 19:07.187
Okay. So how'd you bowl?

19:07.229 --> 19:09.231
No, not about that.

19:09.273 --> 19:11.609
I-I mean,

19:09.273 --> 19:11.609
what's going on with you?

19:11.651 --> 19:13.360
I know you're having

19:11.651 --> 19:13.360
some kind of problem.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.529
Dad, give me a break.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.529
It's no big deal.

19:15.571 --> 19:19.241
Since when

19:15.571 --> 19:19.241
is a mega crisis nothing?

19:19.283 --> 19:21.494
Mega crisis?

Oh, I...I don't know.

19:24.872 --> 19:28.042
It just it kinda popped

19:24.872 --> 19:28.042
into my head just now.

19:28.084 --> 19:29.836
You mean you just popped

19:28.084 --> 19:29.836
into my sock drawer

19:29.877 --> 19:32.130
and went through

19:29.877 --> 19:32.130
my personal property!

19:32.171 --> 19:34.423
- How could you do that?

19:32.171 --> 19:34.423
- Deej, it was an accident.

19:34.465 --> 19:36.134

You were spying on me,

19:38.845 --> 19:41.430
and you know it!

19:41.472 --> 19:43.891
What was I supposed to do?

19:41.472 --> 19:43.891
You wouldn't even talk to me.

19:43.933 --> 19:46.102
Maybe it was none

19:43.933 --> 19:46.102

19:46.144 --> 19:48.729
What's next?

19:46.144 --> 19:48.729
Are you going to bug my phone?

Hey, I don't like

19:48.771 --> 19:51.107

20:47.955 --> 20:50.416

with every little problem.

When you were my age, did you go

21:03.470 --> 21:06.432
tell your parents everything?

21:07.808 --> 21:10.477
No. But they were old.

They were...my age.

Look, dad, if there's

21:18.736 --> 21:21.239
some serious problem

21:21.280 --> 21:22.281
that I can't handle

21:22.322 --> 21:24.158
I'm gonna come to you.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.702
Just like I always did.

21:26.744 --> 21:29.122
And I'll be here for you, Deej.

It's okay.

21:49.100 --> 21:52.352
So do you really want to know

21:49.100 --> 21:52.352
about my "mega crisis"?

21:52.394 --> 21:54.814
Hey, I don't want to pry.

21:54.855 --> 21:57.691

21:57.733 --> 21:59.693

22:03.114 --> 22:04.364
Oh, thank God!

22:06.993 --> 22:08.953
Dad, that is not a good thing.

22:08.995 --> 22:11.789
Oh, right.

22:08.995 --> 22:11.789
That's bad. Right.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.041
You see, I never even

22:11.831 --> 22:14.041
kissed this guy

22:14.083 --> 22:16.294

22:14.083 --> 22:16.294
spreading this ugly rumor

22:16.335 --> 22:18.545

22:16.335 --> 22:18.545

22:20.089 --> 22:22.216
