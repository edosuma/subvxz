Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, thanks
for coming in to see me today.

00:37.054 --> 00:38.256
Is this about Chris?

00:38.289 --> 00:40.358
We know he's been
struggling lately.

00:40.391 --> 00:42.227
Well, let me put it this way.

00:42.260 --> 00:44.362
(quickly): Parents of
a failing student say what?

00:44.395 --> 00:45.530
-What?
-No, Peter, wait.

00:45.563 --> 00:48.366
Nope, too late; he said it.
I'm marking it.

00:48.399 --> 00:51.202
Didn't get the Woos;
they're very smart. Asian.

00:51.236 --> 00:53.371
Maybe they didn't understand me.
I don't know.

00:53.404 --> 00:55.573
The point is,
Chris's grades aren't improving,

00:55.606 --> 00:58.042
and just yesterday,
he caused a little ruckus

00:58.075 --> 00:59.544
in his history class.

00:59.577 --> 01:02.079
(rapping): ♪ Alexander Hamilton
was white. ♪

01:02.113 --> 01:05.216
I just can't understand
why he's doing so poorly.

01:05.250 --> 01:06.884
We here feel
that the best solution

01:06.917 --> 01:10.888
is for Chris to attend something
called vocational school.

01:10.921 --> 01:12.890
Yeah, you know what?
Chris deserves a vocation.

01:12.923 --> 01:14.892
He's been working hard,
he's doing great in school...

01:14.925 --> 01:16.927
No, vocational school is where

01:16.961 --> 01:20.265
less academically capable
students learn a trade.

01:20.298 --> 01:22.933
Don't you have to be Italian
to go to one of those schools?

01:22.967 --> 01:24.735
Uhp, there will be
plenty of those jokes

01:24.769 --> 01:25.803
later in the episode.

01:25.836 --> 01:27.438
Now, won't vocational school

01:27.472 --> 01:29.407
limit Chris's options
down the road?

01:29.440 --> 01:30.575
Oh, hardly.

01:30.608 --> 01:32.977
He'll have a wide range
of career options,

01:33.010 --> 01:34.145
such as the following:

01:34.179 --> 01:36.181
(peppy music playing)

02:01.806 --> 02:03.341
Those are three
terrible options.

02:03.374 --> 02:05.276
(quickly): Parents who are okay
with this say what?

02:05.310 --> 02:06.311
-What?
-Gotcha.

02:06.344 --> 02:07.978
That one's on you, Lois.

02:11.982 --> 02:14.452
Why, Meg, don't you look
pretty today.

02:14.485 --> 02:15.620
Thanks, Mom.

02:15.653 --> 02:17.121
She's going to
ask you for something.

02:17.154 --> 02:18.956
So, listen, I was wondering.

02:18.989 --> 02:20.291
Do you think you could
take Stewie

02:20.325 --> 02:21.859
to a birthday party today?

02:21.892 --> 02:23.461
The birthday boy was premature,

02:23.494 --> 02:25.963
so he looks like
a 12-inch-tall Rachel Dratch.

02:25.996 --> 02:27.465
Why can't you do it, Mom?

02:27.498 --> 02:28.966
(groans)
I can't take another party

02:28.999 --> 02:31.736
with that trio
of judgy sitcom moms.

02:32.870 --> 02:34.505
Oh, hi, Lois.

02:34.539 --> 02:37.975
Gosh, I just love how you
always look so comfortable.

02:38.008 --> 02:40.311
I know. Are those pajamas?

02:40.345 --> 02:43.348
And I'm the black one
for unrealistic diversity.

02:48.853 --> 02:51.656
I can't believe I have to go
to vocational school.

02:51.689 --> 02:53.358
Does this mean I'm a failure?

02:53.391 --> 02:56.060
No, sweetie.
It means that we're failures.

02:56.093 --> 02:58.829
You know, I'm always at a loss
for words in these moments.

02:58.863 --> 03:00.731
Fred Sanford,
you want to do the honors?

03:00.765 --> 03:02.733
Go get 'em, you big dummy.

03:02.767 --> 03:05.503
Um, your show went off the air
40 years ago,

03:05.536 --> 03:07.672
and you died 30 years ago,

03:07.705 --> 03:11.509
so that phrase
means very little to me.

03:11.542 --> 03:14.078
I know it's a big step,
honey, but you can do it.

03:14.111 --> 03:16.581
That's right, Chris.
This family's never shied away

03:16.614 --> 03:18.849
from a new challenge,
like when I was the spokesman

03:18.883 --> 03:21.686
for that perfume,
Deschanel Number Five.

03:21.719 --> 03:24.021
PETER (whispering):
Precious. Annoying.

03:24.054 --> 03:26.023
Twee.

03:26.056 --> 03:28.793
Hot, but not worth it.

03:29.894 --> 03:33.398
Probably a nightmare in person.

03:33.431 --> 03:36.066
Deschanel.

03:36.100 --> 03:37.868
The fragrance
for when you want to smell

03:37.902 --> 03:40.571
like a 40-year-old toddler.

03:40.605 --> 03:42.373
Can I help you?

03:42.407 --> 03:45.710
Yes, I'm here for my first day
of vocational school.

03:45.743 --> 03:47.378
Right this way.

Chris Griffin.

04:28.953 --> 04:31.088
So everybody give him an "ayy."

04:31.121 --> 04:32.657
STUDENTS:
Ayy.

04:32.690 --> 04:36.260
Look at that, your first day,
and you got all A's.

04:36.293 --> 04:37.928
Come here,
let me pinch your cheek.

04:37.962 --> 04:39.263
Got all A's.

04:39.296 --> 04:42.600
(laughs) You're expressing
affection and dominance.

04:42.633 --> 04:45.636
Griffin? Where's the "Ucci"
or "Squalotta" at the end?

04:45.670 --> 04:46.937
-You Jewish?
-No.

04:46.971 --> 04:48.138
It true, if you're Jewish,

04:48.172 --> 04:49.940
they cut your dong off
with an ax?

04:49.974 --> 04:52.276
My uncle's Jewish.
Friggin' mess, that guy.

04:52.309 --> 04:55.813
Hey, chip-chop, it's 9:30.
Let's start thinking lunch.

04:59.316 --> 05:01.285
We do a nice
sit-down thing here.

Little piccata, little veal.

05:03.020 --> 05:05.122

05:05.155 --> 05:07.792
Okay, everybody dirty up
your hands, we'll eat in ten.

05:07.825 --> 05:11.128
Wow. This is way better than
that barber school I went to

05:11.161 --> 05:13.464
where I couldn't stop
pumping the chair.

05:13.498 --> 05:16.300
Just a bit off the top
and shorter on the sides.

05:16.333 --> 05:19.970
We're just
gonna be pumping today.

05:20.004 --> 05:22.139

05:22.172 --> 05:24.174
Did you bring the cups?!

05:24.208 --> 05:25.976
Um, uh, no.

05:26.010 --> 05:27.978
My mom didn't say
anything about cups.

You'll be the talk of the town
with your new macaroni necklace.

07:44.882 --> 07:47.117
That's right, you'll be
strutting down Spooner Street

07:47.151 --> 07:48.953

macaroni necklace

07:48.986 --> 07:51.622
made with Oral-B dental floss

Why don't you pick on
someone your own size,

08:30.761 --> 08:33.030
You know you're not
supposed to be on the furniture.

08:35.199 --> 08:38.168
Look at her. She just
sits there and takes it.

08:38.202 --> 08:40.504
She deserves a better life

08:40.537 --> 08:43.007

I'm going to give it to her.

08:43.040 --> 08:44.341
How you gonna do that?

08:44.374 --> 08:46.510
I don't know, but it's
going to be a challenge,

-Oh.

09:16.774 --> 09:18.208
All right, Chris.

09:18.242 --> 09:21.111
A big part of being a mechanic
is being completely shocked

09:21.145 --> 09:23.380
when somebody hasn't had
a particular item

09:23.413 --> 09:25.382
-on a restaurant menu.
-Hey, Chrissie.

09:25.415 --> 09:26.917
We're thinking about
going over to Pete's.

09:26.951 --> 09:28.552
You want a bread sandwich?

09:28.585 --> 09:30.554
-What's a bread sandwich?
-What?

09:30.587 --> 09:32.556
You never had
a bread sandwich from Pete's?

09:32.589 --> 09:35.392
Everyone who's not currently
in the room, get over here.

09:35.425 --> 09:37.728

a Pete's bread sandwich.

09:37.762 --> 09:40.765
Whoa, whoa, what? You never had
a bread sandwich from Pete's?

09:40.798 --> 09:43.233
We've covered this.
Somebody tell me what it is.

09:43.267 --> 09:45.569
What do you think it is?
It's three pieces of bread.

09:45.602 --> 09:47.905
Me, I like a piece
of sourdough on top,

09:47.938 --> 09:49.573
piece of sourdough on bottom,

09:49.606 --> 09:52.076
and a nice piece of wheat
in the middle.

09:52.109 --> 09:54.578
I like to go rye, rye, rye.

09:54.611 --> 09:55.780
I'm a rye guy.

09:55.813 --> 09:57.247
Hey, you guys going to Pete's?

09:57.281 --> 09:58.949
Someone get me a bread sandwich.

09:58.983 --> 10:00.918
-Griffin's never had one.
-What?

10:00.951 --> 10:02.419
-What?
-Guys.

10:02.452 --> 10:04.789
I just called Pete's.
They're closed forever.

10:04.822 --> 10:06.623
STUDENTS:
What?

10:06.657 --> 10:08.625
Who answered the phone?

10:13.297 --> 10:15.299
All right, Stewie,
how do we make Meg popular?

10:15.332 --> 10:16.767
I've got it all figured out.

10:16.801 --> 10:18.969
They're posting the cast list
for the school play.

10:19.003 --> 10:20.938
I'll just give Meg
all the parts.

10:20.971 --> 10:23.774
That way, she'll be
the most popular girl in school.

10:23.808 --> 10:26.443
Good night, good night.

10:26.476 --> 10:28.846
As sweet repose and rest.

10:28.879 --> 10:32.316
Come to thy heart
as that within my breast.

10:35.219 --> 10:39.289
(deep voice): O, wilt thou
leave me so unsatisfied?

10:39.323 --> 10:42.960
(grunting, panting)

10:42.993 --> 10:44.962
(normal voice):
What satisfaction

10:44.995 --> 10:47.798
canst thou have tonight?

10:47.832 --> 10:49.499
(grunts) That son of a bitch.

10:50.367 --> 10:52.202
(panting)

10:52.236 --> 10:54.638
(deep voice):
Th' exchange of thy love's

10:54.671 --> 10:56.974
faithful vow for mine.

10:57.007 --> 10:58.308
(Cockney accent):
'Ello, 'ello, 'ello.

10:58.342 --> 10:59.309
What's all this, then?

10:59.343 --> 11:01.345
(applause)

11:06.016 --> 11:07.985
-Well, that didn't work.
-Don't worry, Brian.

11:08.018 --> 11:09.987
We've still got
the spring musical.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.445
(man coughs)

11:41.218 --> 11:42.887
She can't be helped.

11:46.390 --> 11:49.426
Mr. and Mrs. G, thanks so much
for having us over for dinner.

11:49.459 --> 11:50.761
Oh, it's our pleasure.

11:50.795 --> 11:53.197
Chris has said
so many nice things about you.

11:53.230 --> 11:55.032
Ah, maybe one or two
of 'em are true.

11:55.065 --> 11:57.267
(laughing)

11:57.301 --> 11:59.703
Chris, tell your mom and dad
about the story you wrote.

11:59.736 --> 12:01.205
Oh, I don't know.

12:01.238 --> 12:03.273
Chris, come on, don't be shy.

12:03.307 --> 12:05.776
Okay. It's called
"The Black Duck."

12:05.810 --> 12:08.545
"The Black Duck."
You ever seen a black duck?

12:08.578 --> 12:10.380
I seen a brown duck,
a yellow duck,

12:10.414 --> 12:11.882
a white duck with a green head.

12:11.916 --> 12:15.219
Hey, there's all kinds of ducks.
This kid thinks of a black one.

12:15.252 --> 12:17.387
Come on, it's just
a stupid story, guys.

12:17.421 --> 12:19.556
Hey! If it was
such a stupid story,

12:19.589 --> 12:22.059
why would it have such
a well-rounded protagonist?

12:22.092 --> 12:24.094
Remember what I told you
behind the garage?

12:24.128 --> 12:25.395
That you might be gay?

12:25.429 --> 12:27.397
Wh-What? No, no,
I didn't say that.

12:27.431 --> 12:29.066
The-the imagination on this one.

12:29.099 --> 12:31.135
Black ducks, I'm gay,
what's next?

12:31.168 --> 12:33.737
M-Martians?
L-Little green Martian people?

12:33.770 --> 12:37.307
Oh, Chris, I'm so happy you have
so many wonderful new friends.

12:37.341 --> 12:39.743
He was very unpopular
in high school.

12:39.776 --> 12:41.245
Oh, yeah, you know,
he's strong, too.

12:41.278 --> 12:43.247
He takes care
of a lot of stuff for us.

12:43.280 --> 12:44.448
Stuff?

12:44.481 --> 12:46.917
Yeah, he-he took care
of one of our competitors.

12:46.951 --> 12:49.286
Mr. Firestone says hello.

12:49.319 --> 12:51.288
Ow. Ow. Ow.

12:51.321 --> 12:53.590
-Stop it. Stop it.
-(air hissing)

12:53.623 --> 12:55.425
Oh, my God, Chris!

12:55.459 --> 12:57.427
That's silly,
but it's still murder!

12:57.461 --> 12:59.763
Relax. That Michelin Man
had no family.

12:59.796 --> 13:02.466
He came from tires, Ma!

13:06.170 --> 13:08.105
All right,
if we can't make Meg popular,

13:08.138 --> 13:10.774
we can at least
find her a boyfriend.

13:10.807 --> 13:13.443
Neil, can you come out?
We need to talk to you.

13:13.477 --> 13:16.013
NEIL:
I can't open the door.
It's the Sabbath.

13:16.046 --> 13:18.182
You can come around
the back entrance.

13:18.215 --> 13:19.649
(both sigh)

13:21.986 --> 13:23.787
Why are all the lights off?

13:23.820 --> 13:26.123
I can't turn them on myself.
It's the Sabbath.

13:26.156 --> 13:28.458
Get the lights for me, will you?

13:28.492 --> 13:31.128
Also, can you pick up the phone
and order me a pizza?

13:31.161 --> 13:33.630
I can't do it.
It's the Sabbath.

13:33.663 --> 13:35.966
Listen, Neil, we really
wanted to talk about Meg.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.135
That can wait.
I've just looked at some porn,

13:38.168 --> 13:41.138
and I need you guys
to give me some assisted relief.

13:41.171 --> 13:43.974
I can't do it myself.
It's the Sabbath.

13:44.008 --> 13:46.543
Okay, this-this is starting
to sound a little weird.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.845
It's not weird.
It's Jewish.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.851
I can't believe we did all that
and he still turned us down.

13:54.885 --> 13:58.188
I know, and al-also, Brian,
it's Thursday.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.826
Well, I am officially
out of ideas.

14:02.859 --> 14:04.694
Yes, there's literally
no one in town

14:04.728 --> 14:07.164
sad and desperate enough
to date my sister.

14:07.197 --> 14:10.034
Hey, guys, can you hold my phone
and point it over this way?

14:10.067 --> 14:12.002
I want to live-stream
my suicide.

14:12.036 --> 14:13.337
Yeah, sure, Kevin.

14:13.370 --> 14:15.405
You know what it is, Stewie?
It's a selfishness.

14:15.439 --> 14:17.041
It's an inability to look out

14:17.074 --> 14:19.009
and see someone
who needs someone.

14:19.043 --> 14:20.377
It's-it's just...
it's a lack of empathy.

14:20.410 --> 14:22.179
Can you make sure
I'm totally in the frame?

14:22.212 --> 14:24.014
Yeah, I'm not a pro.
You get what you get.

14:24.048 --> 14:25.749
Anyway, what is wrong
with people that they're

14:25.782 --> 14:28.919
so myopic and just preoccupied
with their own little lives?

14:28.953 --> 14:31.688
-Is it on?
-It's whatever it was
when you handed it to me.

14:31.721 --> 14:33.723
The point is, there's someone
out there for everyone

14:33.757 --> 14:36.093
if they're just willing
to open their eyes and look.

14:36.126 --> 14:38.595
Wait a second!
Don't you see, Brian?

14:38.628 --> 14:40.597
Oh, my God, you're right!

14:40.630 --> 14:42.866
Kevin, before you
go through with this,

14:42.899 --> 14:45.035
would you consider
taking Meg out for a date?

14:45.069 --> 14:46.770
Meg? Why?

14:46.803 --> 14:48.605
Look, we know
you've had a hard road

14:48.638 --> 14:50.374
ever since
you came home from Iraq.

14:50.407 --> 14:52.776
Well, this could be a chance
for you to help someone else

14:52.809 --> 14:54.945
who maybe feels
as bad inside as you do.

14:56.913 --> 14:58.882
Okay. I'll ask her out.

14:58.915 --> 15:00.417
Great. Call her tomorrow.

15:00.450 --> 15:01.952
Tonight she's doing
the fall play.

15:01.986 --> 15:04.388
It's a one-woman
performance of Hair.

15:04.421 --> 15:06.390

15:21.771 --> 15:23.273
(giggles)
I finished the book.

15:31.281 --> 15:32.749
All right, Brian.
Here comes Meg.

15:32.782 --> 15:34.751
Now, don't let on
that we had anything to do

15:34.784 --> 15:35.919
with Kevin asking her out.

15:35.952 --> 15:37.587
Relax.
I know how to keep my cool.

15:37.621 --> 15:38.788
You guys!

15:38.822 --> 15:40.924
I'm going out
with Kevin Swanson!

15:40.957 --> 15:42.926
Get out of here!

15:42.959 --> 15:44.828
Brian, why are your hands
on your hips?

15:44.861 --> 15:46.096
(quietly):
Turn it down a notch.

15:46.130 --> 15:49.299
Yeah, he asked me out.
Totally out of the blue.

15:49.333 --> 15:51.101
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

15:51.135 --> 15:53.470
Get your hand off
your cheek, you mess.

15:57.307 --> 15:59.109
Principal Shepherd,
we came to ask

15:59.143 --> 16:02.279
if there's anything we can do
to get Chris back in the school.

16:02.312 --> 16:05.115
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,
I-I'm afraid we can't do that.

16:05.149 --> 16:07.451
Oh, I think you can.

16:07.484 --> 16:10.320
I think you can do that
and a whole lot more.

16:11.321 --> 16:12.789
Oh, my God.

16:12.822 --> 16:15.492
That is not what a testicle
is supposed to look like.

16:15.525 --> 16:16.860
Has a doctor seen this?

16:16.893 --> 16:19.529
What are you gonna do,
charge me with smoking?

16:19.563 --> 16:22.132
Mr. Griffin, I'm afraid
you have testicular cancer.

16:22.166 --> 16:23.967
I'm sorry,
there's nothing I can do.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.336
Oh, I think maybe there is.

16:27.671 --> 16:30.006
If you keep doing that,
you're gonna pop it.

16:33.177 --> 16:35.645
Stewie, I still don't understand
why we have to pretend

16:35.679 --> 16:36.880
to work at the restaurant.

16:36.913 --> 16:38.482
It's all part
of the plan, Brian.

16:38.515 --> 16:40.817
Meg and Kevin need to have
the perfect date.

16:40.850 --> 16:43.320
That's why I gave the rest
of the staff the night off.

16:43.353 --> 16:45.489
We have to be in total control
of the evening.

16:45.522 --> 16:46.990
Two for Swanson.

16:47.023 --> 16:49.393
(high-pitched): I'm sorry,
we have nothing under that name,

16:49.426 --> 16:51.361
-and we're all full.
-Oh, I...

16:51.395 --> 16:53.330
Uh, actually, I think
a table just opened up.

16:53.363 --> 16:55.031
Right this way.

16:56.032 --> 16:58.368
-What the hell?
-Sorry, I choked.

16:58.402 --> 17:00.704
Hi. We're the Hollender
rehearsal dinner.

17:00.737 --> 17:02.839
There are 46 of us.

17:02.872 --> 17:05.175
Uh, Stewie, before you gave
the staff the night off,

17:05.209 --> 17:06.676
did you check
the reservation book?

17:06.710 --> 17:08.011
I did not.

17:08.044 --> 17:10.847
And to remind you,
24 of us selected the salmon,

17:10.880 --> 17:13.517
16 the filet,
and six vegetarian.

17:13.550 --> 17:14.851
MAN:
One vegan.

17:14.884 --> 17:17.421
Five vegetarian, one vegan.

17:17.454 --> 17:19.356
-What do we do?
-Just keep giving them crayons

17:19.389 --> 17:20.924
until we figure it out.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.392
More appetizer?

17:22.426 --> 17:23.860
No, thanks.

17:23.893 --> 17:26.563
Cauliflower gives me the scoots.

17:29.899 --> 17:32.102
Chris, there's something
your father and I

17:32.136 --> 17:34.037
want to talk to you about.

17:34.070 --> 17:36.540
Uh, Chris? Ch-Chris?

17:36.573 --> 17:39.209
Sorry, I only answer
to "Chrissie" now.

17:39.243 --> 17:41.911
-Fine. Chrissie?
-Yeah, Ma?

17:41.945 --> 17:46.049
Can you stop lifting your rusty
weights while we talk to you?

17:46.082 --> 17:48.952
Chris, we're worried
about you and your new friends.

17:48.985 --> 17:51.421
Pa, don't worry about it.

17:51.455 --> 17:53.723
Don't worry about it.

17:53.757 --> 17:56.393
-Okay.
-No, Peter, it's not okay.

17:56.426 --> 17:59.629
Chris, we don't want you
in the Mafia.

17:59.663 --> 18:02.399
Hey, I'm in waste management.

18:02.432 --> 18:05.569
Chris, you need to be back in
high school where you belong.

18:05.602 --> 18:07.604
But Principal Shepherd
won't let you back in,

18:07.637 --> 18:09.473
and we don't know what to do.

18:09.506 --> 18:12.809
What do I need school for?
Tony Danza never went to school,

18:12.842 --> 18:16.746
and he played a guy named Tony
on four different TV shows.

18:16.780 --> 18:17.914
Lois, let me handle this.

18:17.947 --> 18:19.583
Chris, I'm gonna say this
in a way

18:19.616 --> 18:22.252
an Italian mechanic
would understand.

18:22.286 --> 18:23.920
You're breaking
your mother's heart!

18:23.953 --> 18:26.956
Ma! Why didn't you say so, Ma?!

18:26.990 --> 18:29.293
I'll take care of it.

was wildly inventive.

So, Meg, how was your night out
with your boyfriend?

19:47.371 --> 19:50.006
-Actually, we broke up.
-Aw.

19:50.039 --> 19:51.675
Aw, Meg, I'm so sorry.

19:51.708 --> 19:53.377
Well, I guess some people
are just

19:53.410 --> 19:54.878
meant to be alone, you know?

19:54.911 --> 19:56.846
They're so broken inside.

19:56.880 --> 19:59.182
They're just not worth it.

19:59.215 --> 20:01.518
Don't say that, Meg.
You're totally worth it.

20:01.551 --> 20:04.521
I'm not talking about me.
I'm talking about Kevin.

20:04.554 --> 20:06.856
He's a psycho.
I dumped his ass.

20:06.890 --> 20:09.025
So... you're okay with it?

20:09.058 --> 20:12.862
Yeah, it actually felt great
to be empowered for once.

20:12.896 --> 20:15.098
Good night, guys.

20:15.131 --> 20:17.200

we actually did

20:17.233 --> 20:19.536
make Meg's life
a little bit better.

the show is running long.

-We've got to speed this up.
-Oh, that's okay.

20:26.976 --> 20:29.112
I'm sure they can fix it
in editing. What I was saying...

20:29.145 --> 20:31.047
Because it's all about
family and...

20:31.080 --> 20:32.882

So, Chris, how was
your first day back at school?

20:43.327 --> 20:46.730
It was fine. I'll miss the guys
at vocational school,

20:46.763 --> 20:49.299
but it is nice
to be back where I belong.

20:49.333 --> 20:51.267
-(knock at door)
-I'll get it.

20:52.268 --> 20:53.437
That's him.

20:53.470 --> 20:55.071
That's the one who popped me.

20:55.104 --> 20:56.072
Are you sure?

20:56.105 --> 20:57.741
Yes, I'm sure.

20:57.774 --> 20:59.943
Did I not sound sure?
