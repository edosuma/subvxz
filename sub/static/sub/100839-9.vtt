You're still so beautiful.

Yeah. Haven't read it.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.000
Me neither.

02:51.004 --> 02:51.880
Why are you here?

02:54.090 --> 02:56.551
I, um, I lost some people recently.

02:58.011 --> 03:01.639
And I just didn't want any more time
to go by before I saw you again.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.475
-[exhales]
-You're my mother.

03:06.019 --> 03:06.853

Aww, I miss you, too.

03:10.815 --> 03:13.067
It's-- it's been 15 years.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.819
Part of me thought
I'd never see you again.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.405
I just figured you didn't want anything
to do with me.

03:17.488 --> 03:18.489
Mom...

03:19.365 --> 03:20.909
I sent you all those letters.

03:21.534 --> 03:22.619
I kept trying.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.914
I just thought that you didn't want
to see me.

03:26.289 --> 03:27.248
I wrote you back.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.208
You did?

03:28.291 --> 03:29.500
Of course.

03:29.959 --> 03:31.085
I never got 'em.

03:31.169 --> 03:33.922
-And then you never called me, so I just--
-No, don't. Come on, don't.

03:34.005 --> 03:36.966
Look, you did the right thing,
staying away.

03:37.508 --> 03:39.344
And I never worried about you.

03:39.802 --> 03:42.722
The world has always loved taking care
of you.

03:43.514 --> 03:44.641
With that face.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.318
How long are you gonna be in here
this time?

03:55.944 --> 03:58.112
I don't know. Could be five, could be ten.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.447
I haven't decided.

03:59.530 --> 04:00.531
But I'm all right.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.659
Really, I'm good.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.035
I'm sober.

04:05.245 --> 04:09.123
This is actually the most peace I've felt
in a long time.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.292
-Really?
-Mmm.

04:11.834 --> 04:15.880
You know how exhausting it is
to hide and lie all the time?

04:19.592 --> 04:20.551
I got here,

04:21.594 --> 04:23.471
it was like I could finally exhale.

04:25.807 --> 04:26.766
Right.

04:29.018 --> 04:30.311
It's not the worst thing,

04:30.895 --> 04:32.188
paying the price.

04:33.690 --> 04:34.524
Yeah.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.444
I could see how that would be a relief.

04:45.118 --> 04:48.246
Hi. I'm still here. [laughing]

04:48.329 --> 04:49.205

04:53.251 --> 04:55.003
Yeah, feels like you are a little bit.

04:55.086 --> 04:56.421
And I get it.

04:56.504 --> 05:00.675
You're with somebody new,
and it's scary and weird.

05:01.175 --> 05:03.136
I think all we can really do is...

05:04.512 --> 05:05.513
dance it out.

05:06.806 --> 05:07.849
No, what?

05:07.932 --> 05:09.684

Rumor has it,
I have a parole hearing coming up.

Maybe I'll get out sooner than later.

10:19.535 --> 10:20.369
Really?

10:21.037 --> 10:24.832

but I don't have any money.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.593
[stammers] Oh, no, no, look,

10:36.385 --> 10:38.763
if you can't show up for me like that,
you can't.

10:44.769 --> 10:45.936
Well, maybe I can try.

10:47.396 --> 10:48.606
That would mean a lot.

[Jen] Morning.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.031
-[Henry] Hey, Mom.
-Hello.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.492
So I saw Ben
coming down the stairs earlier.

11:00.284 --> 11:01.118
Ben was here?

11:01.327 --> 11:04.914
Uh, yeah, he was here for just a second
to talk about some real estate stuff.

11:05.456 --> 11:06.290
In your bedroom?

11:06.374 --> 11:07.208
Yes.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.379
Well, he seemed upset when he left.

11:12.046 --> 11:12.880
He did?

11:14.090 --> 11:14.924
Yeah.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.175
Oh, shut up!

11:16.258 --> 11:17.510
I didn't say anything.

11:17.593 --> 11:19.595
No, honey, I'm sorry.
It's not you, it's...

11:19.720 --> 11:23.307
[huffs] The city council
denied my stop sign petition.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.558
-Seriously?
-Why?

11:24.642 --> 11:25.685
I don't know, it doesn't say.

11:25.768 --> 11:29.063
It's just an impersonal rejection
from some faceless assholes.

11:29.313 --> 11:31.190
So that's it?
We did all that work for nothing?

11:33.943 --> 11:35.528
No. That's not it.

11:37.780 --> 11:40.616
-[Henry] Where are you going?
-To make them tell me to my face.

11:40.991 --> 11:42.743
-Can I come with you?
-Uh, no, you may not.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.329
You are gonna finish your breakfast,
and when you're done eating,

11:45.413 --> 11:47.957
you're gonna take your bowl
to the dishwasher for once in your life.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.084
I'm on your side. Why are you mad at me?

11:50.167 --> 11:52.253
[Jen] I'm not, I'm just covering my bases.

11:52.336 --> 11:53.337
[Charlie muttering]

12:02.763 --> 12:04.724
[woman] I mean, I've done the research,

12:04.890 --> 12:07.226
and the numbers are very compelling.

12:08.310 --> 12:10.563
I'm just very passionate about this.

12:11.605 --> 12:14.066
So I think, in terms of medians...

12:16.235 --> 12:17.111
we shouldn't.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.410
Hi. Jen Harding,

12:24.744 --> 12:28.622
real estate agent, mom,
and I am here to say no.

12:29.707 --> 12:30.541
To medians?

12:30.624 --> 12:31.876
No, to you.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.085
I beg your pardon.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.171
I submitted a proposal for a stop sign

12:35.254 --> 12:37.506
that was just rejected by this council,

12:37.590 --> 12:39.759
so I am here to reject your rejection.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.136
Well, I'm sorry,
but this is the median hearing.

12:42.219 --> 12:44.013
Well, now we're gonna
talk about stop signs.

12:44.096 --> 12:46.515
Well, unfortunately,
that request was denied

12:46.974 --> 12:49.351
because stop signs slow down traffic.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.604
Uh, that's the point.

12:51.687 --> 12:54.857
After review, the board actually felt
that it could do more harm than good.

12:54.940 --> 12:55.775
I'm sorry,

12:56.275 --> 12:57.735
who's a stop sign gonna harm?

12:58.277 --> 13:01.280
Except for some asshole who bought a Lambo

13:01.363 --> 13:03.699
-to compensate for his micro dick?
-[crowd murmuring]

13:03.783 --> 13:05.701
Miss, we really don't need
that kind of language.

13:05.785 --> 13:06.619
Okay.... [groans]

13:06.702 --> 13:08.746
Please don't call me "miss."
That is annoying.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.372
I'm a full-grown fucking woman,

13:11.040 --> 13:13.876
and I have a teenage son
who's about to get his driver's license,

13:13.959 --> 13:15.336
and I am trying to protect him

13:16.212 --> 13:18.297
and make this neighborhood safer for him

13:18.380 --> 13:19.465
and for all of you.

13:19.548 --> 13:20.883
You know, Mrs. Harding,

13:20.966 --> 13:24.094
I find it interesting
that you're so concerned

13:24.178 --> 13:26.263
about keeping your neighbors safe.

13:26.764 --> 13:27.807
I'm sorry, do I know you?

13:27.890 --> 13:30.726
Yeah, we met. The name's Andrew.

13:31.519 --> 13:32.436
Andrew Peters.

13:33.896 --> 13:37.691
You might remember me from when you
offered me a free estimate on my house

13:37.775 --> 13:39.109
and then assaulted me.

13:39.193 --> 13:41.445
-Get the fuck off me!
-[grunts, shouts]

13:41.612 --> 13:43.113
No means motherfucking no.

13:43.197 --> 13:44.073
You bitch!

13:44.406 --> 13:45.825
You almost broke my nose.

13:47.326 --> 13:48.536
I should have hit you harder.

13:49.119 --> 13:49.954
Excuse me?

13:50.538 --> 13:52.289
Well, you may remember

13:52.373 --> 13:54.375
that the reason I tried to break your nose

13:54.458 --> 13:56.627
is 'cause you were trying
to force yourself on me

13:56.710 --> 13:58.963
after I repeatedly said no.

13:59.797 --> 14:04.635
And I said no to you,
not just because you are fucking gross...

14:05.845 --> 14:07.513
but because I had just lost my husband,

14:08.055 --> 14:09.723
and the last thing that I needed

14:09.807 --> 14:13.269
was to be molested
by some smug, horny prick.

14:13.352 --> 14:14.478
That's not what happened.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.397
Well, could have used
a stop sign that day, huh?

14:16.480 --> 14:17.565
-[woman] Yeah.
-[crowd murmuring]

14:21.777 --> 14:24.405
And if there had been a stop sign

14:25.322 --> 14:27.408
on the road where my husband was killed...

14:28.200 --> 14:29.660
he might be alive today.

14:30.619 --> 14:32.872
And my boys would still have their father.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.667
And our world wouldn't have fallen apart.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.589
[man] Mrs. Harding, though I'm sorry
to hear about your husband's death,

14:41.672 --> 14:44.258
we don't know that a stop sign
could have saved him.

14:46.510 --> 14:47.970
No, we don't.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.598
But it's one stop sign.

14:52.808 --> 14:55.769
And if there is a chance
of saving someone else

14:55.853 --> 14:59.273
from having to feel how I feel every day
of my life,

14:59.356 --> 15:01.066
then trust me, it is worth it.

15:01.859 --> 15:04.194
Because I wouldn't wish this on anyone.

15:07.656 --> 15:08.490
Even you.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.243
[applause beginning]

15:23.672 --> 15:24.632
Hi.

15:25.049 --> 15:25.883
Miss Hale.

15:25.966 --> 15:28.177
-I think you can call me Judy by now.
-I don't.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.887
Okay. I brought you something.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.018
It's Flo.

15:36.393 --> 15:38.646
I heard she's feeling better.
I mean, not from Michelle,

15:38.729 --> 15:40.814
because she won't return my texts,
which is really hurtful,

15:40.898 --> 15:41.732
-but I--
-Seriously?

15:41.815 --> 15:42.733
Sorry.

15:42.816 --> 15:44.276
Thank you for this.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.361
You're welcome.

15:46.487 --> 15:48.739
I was also hoping that
maybe you could do me a favor.

15:48.822 --> 15:51.033
You think you're in a position
to ask me for favors?

15:51.116 --> 15:53.869
Probably not, but it's about my paintings.
I'm just looking for them.

15:53.953 --> 15:57.331
There's a whole collection of little girls
with holes in their hearts.

15:57.706 --> 15:59.375
-Okay.
-I know it sounds weird,

15:59.458 --> 16:02.461
but they're worth something, and last time
I saw them was at Steve's gallery.

16:02.544 --> 16:04.463
Stop talking.
I have something to show you. Prager!

16:07.007 --> 16:08.050
[Nick] Hello, Judy.

16:08.592 --> 16:11.679
Hey, Nick.
Good to see you back in uniform.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.055
Uh, is it?

16:17.101 --> 16:20.270
[Perez] Can you do me a favor and explain
to me what's happening in these photos?

16:22.231 --> 16:23.524
That is not what it looks like.

16:23.607 --> 16:26.068
Oh, that's not Charlie Harding
with Steve Wood's car?

16:27.027 --> 16:30.030
Charlie has nothing to do
with anything about Steve.

16:30.864 --> 16:31.782
Okay, then...

16:31.865 --> 16:34.368
help us understand why
there's also CCTV footage

16:34.451 --> 16:36.620
of Charlie driving Steve's car
the night it was burned.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.206
Well, I--

16:39.289 --> 16:41.875
Look, our boss is itching for us
to make an arrest in this case.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.585
And he thinks we should be looking at you.

16:44.670 --> 16:45.587
-He does?
-[Perez] He does.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.131
But it's a little hard not
to look at this.

16:47.214 --> 16:48.924
It's our only actual lead.

16:50.801 --> 16:51.802
Yeah.

16:51.885 --> 16:53.262
Well, those are just a few pictures.

16:53.345 --> 16:54.763
[Nick] They don't tell a very good story.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.057
We know Charlie's angry
about his father's death.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.976
And we know he's had access to a gun.

16:59.059 --> 17:01.478
[Perez] The question is whether
he was angry enough to use it, which,

17:01.562 --> 17:04.148
-obviously, we're gonna have to ask him.
-He didn't. That's not what happened.

17:06.608 --> 17:07.526
Then what did?

17:10.988 --> 17:13.240
Look, Charlie's the one
who needs a favor now,

17:13.323 --> 17:15.909
so if you got a better story,
you need to tell us quickly.

17:25.252 --> 17:26.837
Char, Hen!

17:27.463 --> 17:28.797
Mama made dinner!

17:29.631 --> 17:31.425
Sort of a once-in-a-lifetime thing here.

17:32.176 --> 17:35.304
Probably gonna taste like shit,
but that's my love just tasting like shit.

17:36.722 --> 17:37.556
Hello!

17:40.059 --> 17:41.602
Hey, Boop. Dinner's ready.

17:42.519 --> 17:43.520
I'm not hungry.

17:43.604 --> 17:45.606
Hmm? No? What's going on? Are you okay?

17:46.815 --> 17:49.109
-I got into a fight with Shandy.
-Oh.

17:49.318 --> 17:50.986
I don't want to be her friend anymore.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.154
Why?

17:52.696 --> 17:54.239
You guys can't talk it out?

17:54.323 --> 17:56.950
I mean, Shandy, you know, seems like...

17:57.701 --> 17:58.994
very reasonable.

18:00.287 --> 18:01.371
She killed my bird.

18:03.624 --> 18:06.668
-She did?
-I know you told her to lie about it.

18:08.879 --> 18:09.838
Oh.

18:10.589 --> 18:11.548
Why did you do that?

18:12.382 --> 18:13.675
[stammers] I don't...

18:14.301 --> 18:15.385
I don't know, honey.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.012
I'm sorry.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.389
I just-- I knew how upset you were
about the bird,

18:19.473 --> 18:22.851
and I just didn't want you
to feel any worse.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.186
But I do feel worse.

18:24.394 --> 18:27.022
You're my mom,
and you fucking lied to me.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.525
Yeah, um...

18:31.110 --> 18:33.862
Look, I-- I made a mistake, okay?

18:35.531 --> 18:37.574
Moms make mistakes sometimes.

18:38.617 --> 18:39.952
I'm really sorry, honey.

18:40.410 --> 18:42.329
What can I do to make it up to you?

18:42.412 --> 18:43.872
Do you want to go to the arcade?

18:45.624 --> 18:46.667
No.

18:46.750 --> 18:50.921
But maybe when Judy gets home,
she can come up to my room?

18:53.882 --> 18:54.758
Okay.

19:00.597 --> 19:01.974
You have your bird, huh?

19:02.599 --> 19:03.600
Yeah, but...

19:04.434 --> 19:06.562
somehow its-- its tail broke.

19:08.689 --> 19:09.523
Yeah.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.778
All right, well, I love you. [kisses]

19:19.616 --> 19:20.534
Okay.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.957
-Hey, we need to fucking talk.
-What? Oh, God, what now?

19:27.040 --> 19:29.835
I'm not Henry. You don't have to hide shit
from me. You don't have to lie.

19:29.918 --> 19:31.420
Okay, what are you talking about, Charlie?

19:31.503 --> 19:32.337
Everything.

19:33.130 --> 19:36.008
Ben, Steve.
I know you're the one who burned his car.

19:37.050 --> 19:39.136
You had a fucking gas can in your hand.

19:39.261 --> 19:41.180
Look, you don't know
what you're talking about.

19:41.305 --> 19:43.515
Okay? It's none of your fucking business.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.100
It is! It is my business.

19:45.601 --> 19:48.145
You're my mother. Aren't we supposed
to look out for each other?

19:48.228 --> 19:50.189
Yeah. Yeah, we are.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.025
So you need to drop it, okay?

19:53.108 --> 19:54.318
-What--
-Trust me.

19:55.027 --> 19:55.861
Why can't you tell me

19:55.944 --> 19:57.571
-what the fuck is going on?
-Because I can't.

19:57.654 --> 19:58.780
-Why not?
-Because.

19:58.864 --> 19:59.865
Why?

20:00.824 --> 20:03.202
[shuddering] Because I'm scared.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.706
[sighs] Steve Wood...

20:08.707 --> 20:12.502
was involved
with some very dangerous people, okay?

20:13.795 --> 20:16.006
So you, please,

20:16.673 --> 20:19.718
don't say another word
about this ever again.

20:19.801 --> 20:20.844
Do you understand me? 

20:20.928 --> 20:21.762
Yeah.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.766
Not another word, Charlie.

20:27.851 --> 20:28.685
Okay.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.106
What? What is that?

20:35.609 --> 20:36.443
Nothing.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.620
[Nick]
<i>You don't really think the kid did it.</i>

20:46.703 --> 20:48.914
I'm just going off the evidence.
It's all we have.

20:50.624 --> 20:53.627
-Did you take a look at what I gave you?
-I did.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.712
But we need more.
A couple of photos of a guy

20:55.796 --> 20:57.547
walking into an art gallery
doesn't prove much.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.675
Neither does a couple photos
of the kid in the car.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.219
-[clears throat]
-[telephone rings]

21:02.302 --> 21:05.305
Prager, my man, those phones
aren't gonna answer themselves.

21:07.307 --> 21:08.141
So, um...

21:08.934 --> 21:11.186
what did Judy Hale have to say
for herself?

21:11.270 --> 21:12.562
She's not talking yet.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.398
Did you dangle the kid?

21:14.481 --> 21:16.275
I... did.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.527
-Good girl.
-I'm not your girl.

21:18.986 --> 21:19.820
Sorry.

21:20.404 --> 21:23.282
I thought that would be a compliment
for a woman your age.

21:24.908 --> 21:25.742
Bitch.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.171
-[door opens and closes]
-[sighs]

21:39.631 --> 21:40.465
Hey.

21:42.342 --> 21:44.428
I need to see you in the garage, please.
Now.

21:46.263 --> 21:49.266
Really? Just-- fuck. Okay.

21:50.642 --> 21:51.643
[Jen] Hey, hey.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.313
What's going on?

21:56.273 --> 21:58.150
What's going on?
Judy, just tell me what's going on.

21:59.192 --> 22:01.945
The police have pictures
of Charlie driving Steve's car,

22:02.029 --> 22:03.030
the ones that Parker took.

22:03.572 --> 22:04.406
Oh, my God.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.533
They also have him on CCTV...

22:07.784 --> 22:10.203
-driving the car the night it was burned.
-Oh, my God.

22:10.370 --> 22:11.913
They think he did it, Jen.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.124
No, no, no, no.

22:14.207 --> 22:15.834
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

22:15.917 --> 22:16.918
What am I gonna do?

22:17.294 --> 22:18.837
-What am I gonna do, Judy?
-Nothing.

22:18.920 --> 22:19.921
Oh, my God.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.381
-Listen to me. Nothing.
-What?

22:21.757 --> 22:23.050
I'm gonna take the blame.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.886
What? No, no, you're not.

22:25.969 --> 22:27.846
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.

22:27.929 --> 22:30.515
-Oh, fuck, no!
-You are going to let me do this.

22:30.599 --> 22:31.433
I need to do this.

22:31.516 --> 22:32.809
Oh, my God, Judy.

22:32.893 --> 22:33.894
-No.
-Yes.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.228
Listen to me.

22:36.897 --> 22:38.315
The night that Steve died...

22:40.484 --> 22:41.943
I was gonna kill myself.

22:42.527 --> 22:43.403
What?

22:43.487 --> 22:44.988
But then you called me,

22:45.697 --> 22:46.865
