00:03.060 --> 00:05.000
<i>[Larry] My life is hard.</i>

00:05.000 --> 00:08.100
<i>When you get to be
super morbidly obese,</i>

00:08.100 --> 00:10.070
<i>it's very hard.</i>

00:16.380 --> 00:19.150
[woman, crying] <i>Somewhere in
me is this little glimmer of hope.</i>

00:19.150 --> 00:21.780
<i>I just wanna be a normal person.</i>

00:21.780 --> 00:24.550
[grunts, pants]

00:32.760 --> 00:36.230
[man, crying] You can't do
it and then I just get mad.

00:36.230 --> 00:39.570
<i>[woman 2] If I don't make a change
now, I'm scared it's gonna be too late.</i>

00:43.370 --> 00:46.810
[groaning] It's really hard!

00:46.810 --> 00:51.050
<i>[woman 3] I refuse to stop fighting.
I have to do this for my children.</i>

00:57.320 --> 00:59.350
Larry, I can tell that
you're pretty smart.

00:59.360 --> 01:04.220
But being smart and being
self-destructive is a bad combination.

01:19.470 --> 01:27.210
[labored breathing]

01:27.220 --> 01:31.090
<i>[Larry] The first thing that comes to
my mind when I open my eyes up is,</i>

01:31.090 --> 01:33.590
<i>I say God, I thank
you for another day.</i>

01:33.590 --> 01:35.890
<i>Because it is a struggle
being overweight.</i>

01:35.890 --> 01:41.400
<i>And when you get to be super
morbidly obese, it's really a struggle.</i>

01:41.400 --> 01:46.900
<i>When I go to bed, I toss and
turn and roll from side to side</i>

01:46.900 --> 01:48.840
<i>all night long.</i>

01:48.840 --> 01:51.870
Because I fear that I am not
going to wake up.

01:51.870 --> 01:55.680
<i>I have asthma, sleep
apnea, thyroid problems,</i>

01:55.680 --> 01:59.480
<i>and I take medication
for depression,</i>

01:59.480 --> 02:03.850
<i>'cause even food isn't enough to
completely comfort me anymore.</i>

02:03.850 --> 02:09.960
<i>It brings tears to my eyes just to think
that each day could really be my last.</i>

02:11.160 --> 02:15.060
<i>I'm trying to maintain
my composure.</i>

02:15.060 --> 02:17.160
But it... it's
very frightening.

02:17.170 --> 02:19.230
Good morning, Larry.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.300
[Larry] Oh, good morning.

02:21.300 --> 02:23.340
Good morning.
It's time to wake up.

02:23.340 --> 02:24.670
Hmm.

02:24.670 --> 02:25.670
<i>[Larry] I live by myself.</i>

02:25.670 --> 02:28.780
<i>I have a caretaker
named Mr. Lawrence.</i>

02:28.780 --> 02:34.110
<i>He comes seven days a week to help
me wash and feed myself every day.</i>

02:34.120 --> 02:36.720
- Do you need any help?
- Not yet.

02:36.720 --> 02:38.890
Okay.

02:38.890 --> 02:42.060
<i>My right leg is a mass of
hardened lymphedema tissue,</i>

02:42.060 --> 02:45.860
<i>which makes it significantly
larger than my left.</i>

02:45.860 --> 02:48.800
<i>And it's very painful.</i>

02:48.800 --> 02:52.900
The most difficult part of my
day is getting up off the floor.

02:52.900 --> 02:56.100
<i>It takes all my strength,
and it pains me a lot.</i>

02:56.110 --> 02:57.940
[grunting]

02:57.940 --> 03:02.480
<i>Then once I'm up, my
lymphedema pulls me down.</i>

03:02.480 --> 03:06.980
<i>And walking is very, very
difficult. And it hurts bad.</i>

03:08.220 --> 03:13.690
It's a challenge and a struggle
to take a shower all on my own.

03:13.690 --> 03:16.590
<i>But somehow, I manage to
take one every day.</i>

03:16.590 --> 03:19.230
<i>Even though
I'm in constant pain.</i>

03:21.200 --> 03:25.600
<i>The best, kindest, politest
way that I can say it,</i>

03:25.600 --> 03:29.840
I'm very flexible and
I do what I have to do

03:29.840 --> 03:32.970
<i>to get all the way into
the tub and clean myself.</i>

03:32.980 --> 03:34.070
<i>'Cause I am a germophobe.</i>

03:34.080 --> 03:37.080
<i>I make sure that
I'm thoroughly clean.</i>

03:37.080 --> 03:39.810
<i>I have to use bleach
on my body because</i>

03:39.820 --> 03:42.880
<i>it's the only way
I can feel truly clean.</i>

03:42.890 --> 03:45.990
<i>I don't overdo it where
I put burn marks on myself,</i>

03:45.990 --> 03:47.750
<i>but I do use bleach.</i>

03:47.760 --> 03:51.930
<i>It's a challenge of making
sure that I'm totally clean.</i>

03:51.930 --> 03:55.800
<i>I can only stand up
for maybe four minutes</i>

03:55.800 --> 04:00.030
<i>because my right leg hurts
a lot and it's a lot of weight.</i>

04:00.040 --> 04:06.740
<i>My knees, my thighs and
my back hurts the most.</i>

04:06.740 --> 04:11.140
<i>Sharp pain, like fire almost,</i>

04:11.150 --> 04:14.310
<i>running up and down my knee.</i>

04:15.150 --> 04:17.020
<i>I'm not able to walk far.</i>

04:17.020 --> 04:20.520
<i>Moving around
the house is a chore.</i>

04:20.520 --> 04:26.230
I think I use the food
sometimes instead of medicine.

04:26.230 --> 04:29.760
<i>The relationship that I have with
food, I know that it's not normal.</i>

04:29.770 --> 04:32.600
<i>I eat to comfort myself.</i>

04:39.940 --> 04:42.740
<i>When I'm cooking, it's
the only time I'm happy.</i>

04:42.750 --> 04:45.050
<i>Besides when I'm eating.</i>

04:45.050 --> 04:47.180
<i>So it's a time that
I like to sing.</i>

04:47.180 --> 04:48.920
<i>And I sing gospel.</i>

04:48.920 --> 04:52.420
<i>Because the rest of the time,
when I'm not eating,</i>

04:52.420 --> 04:54.990
<i>most of my thoughts
are morbidly depressing.</i>

04:54.990 --> 04:57.490
[panting] Oh, yes.

04:57.490 --> 05:00.430
Gotta start your morning
off with breakfast.

05:01.900 --> 05:05.870
<i>At least when I cook, I can
show the Lord I feel gratitude.</i>

05:05.870 --> 05:09.600
<i>Because I don't just
crave my favorite meals.</i>

05:09.610 --> 05:11.440
<i>I love them.</i>

05:11.440 --> 05:15.380
Whoo-hoo, I got my cheese.

05:15.380 --> 05:17.040
[humming]

05:18.050 --> 05:19.350
Eggs.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.450
English muffins, yes.

05:23.450 --> 05:25.950
<i>I need what food does for me.</i>

05:25.950 --> 05:29.820
<i>It takes a pain and fear of
what's gonna happen to me away.</i>

05:29.830 --> 05:32.830
<i>And it's always been
able to do that for me.</i>

05:32.830 --> 05:36.660
Let's see. How many eggs will
Larry make this morning?

05:36.670 --> 05:39.070
I'll make the normal. Seven.

05:41.040 --> 05:44.170
<i>When I was a child growing
up, I had three sisters,</i>

05:44.170 --> 05:47.170
<i>but I was the quote-
unquote "spoiled one."</i>

05:47.180 --> 05:51.350
<i>My mother would always feed me
whatever I wanted to eat.</i>

05:51.350 --> 05:54.610
<i>Fried chicken, baked
macaroni and cheese.</i>

05:56.120 --> 05:57.880
<i>Sweet potato pie.</i>

05:57.890 --> 05:58.790
<i>And I enjoyed it.</i>

05:58.790 --> 06:00.790
<i>Eating all this food,</i>

06:00.790 --> 06:03.160
<i>it made me feel like I was
the center of attention.</i>

06:03.160 --> 06:06.390
<i>And that made me feel special.</i>

06:06.400 --> 06:09.400
<i>I always felt like I needed
one more taste of that,</i>

06:09.400 --> 06:11.030
<i>whatever it was.</i>

06:11.030 --> 06:12.700
<i>But as I got heavier,</i>

06:12.700 --> 06:16.200
<i>my happy childhood ended
the day I started school.</i>

06:16.210 --> 06:18.940
<i>'Cause I quickly discovered
I wasn't normal.</i>

06:20.910 --> 06:22.210
<i>I had dyslexia,</i>

06:22.210 --> 06:25.010
<i>and no matter what
the teachers tried,</i>

06:25.010 --> 06:26.550
<i>I never learned to read.</i>

06:27.680 --> 06:29.120
<i>So as the years went by,</i>

06:29.120 --> 06:33.090
<i>not being able to read
created anxiety.</i>

06:33.820 --> 06:35.920
<i>And food made me feel better.</i>

06:35.920 --> 06:37.820
<i>And by the time I was ten,</i>

06:37.830 --> 06:40.060
<i>I was 200 pounds.</i>

06:41.260 --> 06:43.330
♪ Come on, bacon ♪

06:43.330 --> 06:46.170
<i>♪ Get a little browner ♪</i>

06:46.170 --> 06:49.300
♪ Come on, bacon ♪

06:49.300 --> 06:52.870
<i>♪ Get a little browner ♪</i>

06:52.880 --> 06:57.780
<i>As I grew bigger, Aunt Gertha,
who was like a second mother to me,</i>

06:57.780 --> 06:59.910
<i>talked to me about my weight,</i>

06:59.920 --> 07:02.080
<i>and I would brush it
off and say I'm fine.</i>

07:02.080 --> 07:06.820
"I'm happy." But I know
I wasn't happy.

07:06.820 --> 07:10.820
At school, I was used to being
ridiculed about my reading issues.

07:10.830 --> 07:13.060
<i>But as I got heavier,</i>

07:13.060 --> 07:17.900
<i>the bullies had more fun
ridiculing me about being obese.</i>

07:17.900 --> 07:19.030
<i>That hurt me very bad.</i>

07:19.030 --> 07:22.740
<i>My faith is what saved me.</i>

07:22.740 --> 07:25.810
<i>Because it was through
my faith that I found singing.</i>

07:25.810 --> 07:27.210
<i>The first time I sang in public,</i>

07:27.210 --> 07:31.780
<i>it was in my church group
at a Sunday service.</i>

07:31.780 --> 07:34.880
Dear Lord, I thank you for the
food that I have prepared.

07:34.880 --> 07:37.180
I ask you to nourish
my body with it,

07:37.190 --> 07:39.820
and bless the ones that
don't have anything to eat.

07:39.820 --> 07:43.660
In Jesus' name, amen.

07:43.660 --> 07:47.830
<i>One lady who heard me asked if I
would like to sing at the Black Expo</i>

07:47.830 --> 07:50.330
<i>in front of an audience
of hundreds of people.</i>

07:50.330 --> 07:52.070
<i>And after the Black Expo,</i>

07:52.070 --> 07:55.100
<i>I was invited to sing at
the Cotton Club in Harlem.</i>

07:55.100 --> 07:57.570
<i>A very successful
producer saw it,</i>

07:57.570 --> 07:59.910
<i>and then after that, he
invited me to collaborate</i>

07:59.910 --> 08:02.580
<i>on a song for his new album.</i>

08:02.580 --> 08:06.110
<i>And then some people in high
school started to see me differently.</i>

08:06.810 --> 08:09.020
Well, everyone
loved Larry's voice,

08:09.020 --> 08:12.850
so I don't really think they
looked at how he looked.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.590
I think they just looked
at how he sung.

08:15.590 --> 08:20.590
<i>Because his voice was like
something I never heard before.</i>

08:20.600 --> 08:22.700
<i>And it make you wanna stand
up if you couldn't stand,</i>

08:22.700 --> 08:24.660
<i>clap your hands if
you couldn't clap.</i>

08:24.670 --> 08:28.270
<i>Because there was something
about him and how he praised God.</i>

08:29.770 --> 08:32.510
<i>[Larry] I felt relieved to
finally experience acceptance</i>

08:32.510 --> 08:34.110
<i>by my peers at school,</i>

08:34.110 --> 08:38.180
<i>and my life outside of home
finally started to improve.</i>

08:40.080 --> 08:43.280
<i>And then the Lord had another
surprise in line for me.</i>

08:43.290 --> 08:47.590
<i>Around the time that I was 15,
my sister Mary Owen</i>

08:47.590 --> 08:50.020
had a child.

08:50.030 --> 08:53.990
She named him Larry.
After me and my father.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.960
<i>That made me feel special.</i>

08:55.960 --> 08:58.230
<i>Little Larry was
a ray of sunshine.</i>

08:58.230 --> 09:00.870
<i>But only a few years
after he was born,</i>

09:00.870 --> 09:01.970
<i>Mary Owen,</i>

09:01.970 --> 09:05.110
she was doing
some type of drugs.

09:05.110 --> 09:10.610
She put, uh, her hand in a pillow
over his mouth just to shut him up,

09:10.610 --> 09:12.950
<i>because he was crying a lot,</i>

09:12.950 --> 09:16.180
<i>and she accidentally suffocated
Little Larry while she was high.</i>

09:16.180 --> 09:20.920
<i>All I could remember is the
casket being so small at the funeral.</i>

09:20.920 --> 09:23.020
<i>That sight got my
nerves really bad.</i>

09:23.030 --> 09:28.260
<i>Of all the pain in my life, the death
of Little Larry destroys me the most.</i>

09:28.260 --> 09:33.500
<i>I was young. So all I could do
is ask myself is why, why?</i>

09:33.500 --> 09:35.800
<i>I still think about
him every day.</i>

09:35.800 --> 09:39.940
<i>So instead of focusing on
the hurt, I focused on singing.</i>

09:39.940 --> 09:42.080
So I hid behind the music.

09:42.080 --> 09:45.710
<i>And that worked for a while,
because I had talent.</i>

09:45.710 --> 09:48.210
<i>People still wanted to be
around me for that.</i>

09:48.220 --> 09:51.350
<i>And for a time, I became
a minor celebrity,</i>

09:51.350 --> 09:53.890
<i>which was the best
time in my life.</i>

09:53.890 --> 09:55.460
<i>'Cause that was my dream,</i>

09:55.460 --> 09:58.220
<i>to become a gospel
recording artist.</i>

09:59.530 --> 10:04.030
<i>Singing wasn't enough to get my
mind off of what happened to Little Larry.</i>

10:04.030 --> 10:08.030
<i>While I was on the stage, bringing
the gospel to thousands of people,</i>

10:08.040 --> 10:12.210
<i>inside, I was enraged and
overwhelmed with sadness.</i>

10:12.210 --> 10:16.840
<i>And as fast as it happened,
my music career faded.</i>

10:16.850 --> 10:19.210
<i>So I was left with food
being the only thing I had</i>

10:19.210 --> 10:22.520
<i>to distract me from what
happened with Little Larry.</i>

10:22.520 --> 10:24.880
In my 20s, I can't even
count. I just kept eating.

10:24.890 --> 10:27.950
<i>I must have been 500 pounds.</i>

10:27.960 --> 10:30.420
<i>I couldn't even make it out
of the house anymore.</i>

10:30.430 --> 10:31.960
I got bigger,

10:31.960 --> 10:33.590
and bigger,

10:34.600 --> 10:37.030
and I lived in one
room in my house.

10:37.030 --> 10:40.430
And that wasn't normal for
a man to live like that.

10:41.170 --> 10:43.900
<i>After that, I avoided
being in public</i>

10:43.910 --> 10:45.970
<i>and stayed home
as much as I could.</i>

10:45.970 --> 10:48.610
<i>And then my sister, who
I was very close to,</i>

10:48.610 --> 10:51.410
<i>Catherine Marie Myers, died.</i>

10:53.080 --> 10:56.780
<i>She had complications due
to a blood clot in her leg,</i>

10:56.790 --> 10:59.620
<i>and she died
unexpectedly that day.</i>

10:59.620 --> 11:02.560
<i>It hurt me to my heart
when she left us.</i>

11:02.560 --> 11:07.130
<i>And the one who was impacted
more than anyone was Mom.</i>

11:07.700 --> 11:11.060
<i>My mom died eight months later.</i>

11:11.070 --> 11:14.270
<i>She grieved so hard over the
passing of my nephew,</i>

11:14.270 --> 11:15.800
<i>and her own daughter,</i>

11:15.800 --> 11:17.900
<i>that her heart literally broke.</i>

11:17.910 --> 11:21.210
<i>When my mother died,
it was very hard on me.</i>

11:21.210 --> 11:25.050
That was the first time I had seen
my father fall on the floor crying.

11:25.750 --> 11:28.050
<i>He was paralyzed by grief,</i>

11:28.050 --> 11:30.520
<i>and being the only
other man in the family,</i>

11:30.520 --> 11:33.090
<i>I had to pull myself
together and help.</i>

11:33.090 --> 11:36.290
<i>'Cause it fell on my shoulders
to make the arrangement.</i>

11:36.290 --> 11:38.730
<i>And that was all
really hard on me,</i>

11:38.730 --> 11:40.890
<i>mentally and emotionally.</i>

11:40.900 --> 11:43.160
<i>Not to mention
physically challenging.</i>

11:43.170 --> 11:45.700
<i>'Cause I was 600 pounds.</i>

11:45.700 --> 11:49.100
<i>When I saw my mom in
the casket, I wanted to cry.</i>

11:49.100 --> 11:51.710
<i>But instead,
I froze emotionally.</i>

11:51.710 --> 11:54.170
<i>'Cause I was in such
a state of shock,</i>

11:54.180 --> 11:58.550
<i>after the service, I fell
down the steps of the church.</i>

11:58.550 --> 12:02.120
<i>Then the fire department
came to assist me.</i>

12:02.120 --> 12:07.150
<i>That's when I was able to admit to
myself that I had a serious problem.</i>

12:07.160 --> 12:09.860
But I still
kept eating after that.

12:09.860 --> 12:13.430
Eggs, you were good
to me to this morning.

12:18.970 --> 12:23.670
<i>After my mom died, I started
snacking more at night.</i>

12:23.670 --> 12:25.910
<i>And just crying more at night.</i>

12:25.910 --> 12:29.340
I was in a wheelchair. I couldn't
even walk from here to there.

12:29.340 --> 12:33.580
<i>And before I knew it,
I was 940 pounds.</i>

12:33.580 --> 12:35.980
<i>I was too big
to take care of myself,</i>

12:35.980 --> 12:40.950
<i>and I had to hire a home attendant
to help me with the most basic things.</i>

12:42.790 --> 12:44.120
<i>I was barely hanging on.</i>

12:44.130 --> 12:48.800
<i>And then one day, my attendant
came and found me in a coma.</i>

12:48.800 --> 12:52.300
<i>He called the ER, and they
admitted me to the hospital.</i>

12:54.140 --> 12:56.000
<i>And then after I was stabilized,</i>

12:56.000 --> 12:59.110
<i>they transferred me into
a rehab nursing home,</i>

12:59.110 --> 13:02.310
<i>and there I stayed
for two and a half years.</i>

13:02.310 --> 13:05.180
<i>I did not like the nursing home.</i>

13:05.180 --> 13:09.580
<i>Aunt Gertha found a hospital in
Harlem that would work with me,</i>

13:09.580 --> 13:11.920
<i>for me to lose 100 pounds.</i>

13:11.920 --> 13:17.090
<i>So I could get a gastric sleeve
operation and start taking care of myself.</i>

13:17.090 --> 13:18.990
I did it in three months.

13:19.590 --> 13:20.860
I was persistent.

13:20.860 --> 13:23.060
Then I had a gastric
sleeve operation.

13:23.060 --> 13:26.900
<i>Then I lost another 300 pounds,</i>

13:26.900 --> 13:29.370
<i>and was able to leave
the nursing home.</i>

13:30.100 --> 13:32.770
<i>As soon as I came
down to 400 pounds,</i>

13:32.770 --> 13:37.010
<i>I was ready to go back to
church and sing the gospel again.</i>

13:37.010 --> 13:40.950
Can I hold your hand, Mr. Lawrence,
for a second? I don't wanna hurt you.

13:43.080 --> 13:45.020
[grunts] Thank you.

13:45.020 --> 13:48.920
<i>And then, my sister Tanya
died of walking pneumonia.</i>

13:48.920 --> 13:51.460
<i>She was gone in five minutes.</i>

13:51.460 --> 13:54.860
<i>It hit hard, even to this day.</i>

13:54.860 --> 13:57.030
<i>There's so much loss.</i>

13:57.030 --> 14:00.570
<i>Then I got depressed
again all of a sudden.</i>

14:00.570 --> 14:06.140
<i>And I would begin to
snack here, snack there.</i>

14:06.140 --> 14:09.580
<i>And next thing I know, I
stretched my stomach back out.</i>

14:09.580 --> 14:12.650
<i>I ate my stitches away.</i>

14:12.650 --> 14:15.550
<i>Which put me right back where
I was being housebound.</i>

14:24.230 --> 14:27.290
<i>Today, I live in this
walk-up on my own.</i>

14:31.100 --> 14:35.900
<i>The weight of my body is too
heavy for my knees and my legs.</i>

14:35.900 --> 14:37.570
I can't. I'm sorry.

14:38.340 --> 14:40.540
My leg is killing me.

14:40.980 --> 14:43.280
<i>And the pain is unbearable.</i>

14:56.990 --> 15:01.090
<i>Mr. Lawrence has to drive me
to the grocery store twice a week,</i>

15:01.100 --> 15:03.030
<i>which is the most
difficult thing.</i>

15:03.030 --> 15:06.730
<i>I can't walk around the store</i>

15:06.740 --> 15:08.840
<i>the way that normal people can,</i>

15:08.840 --> 15:12.240

I get so tired.</i>

15:18.580 --> 15:19.850

15:20.010 --> 15:22.450
- [Mr. Lawrence] Yes, come down. Come down.
- [Larry] Okay.

15:22.450 --> 15:25.520

15:28.890 --> 15:30.220
[Lawrence] Mango.

<i>I feel very dizzy.</i>

15:37.200 --> 15:40.100
<i>When I'm moving around,
I need to drink a lotta juice.</i>

15:40.100 --> 15:42.070
<i>Otherwise, I get dizzy.</i>

15:43.600 --> 15:46.240
<i>And I'm so worried
about fainting.</i>

15:46.240 --> 15:49.210

All right, Larry. I don't want
you beating me up on this trip.

20:31.830 --> 20:34.960

-My crackers! Oh, yes, please!

20:48.280 --> 20:52.810
- [Larry] Put them in that black bag for me.
- [Lawrence] Yes, sir, I will.

- [Larry] All right.
- Two of these things.

21:04.760 --> 21:07.290

<i>[Larry] So that's a blessing.</i>

<i>But I gotta
get down there, first.</i>

21:47.870 --> 21:48.970
<i>It's gonna be hard on me</i>

21:48.970 --> 21:53.210
<i>because moving my body around

21:57.840 --> 22:01.210
<i>And I don't really go to the
bathroom in this situation</i>

22:01.220 --> 22:04.250

go at the end of each day.</i>

22:24.870 --> 22:27.710
<i>I didn't bring
my diuretic medicine.</i>

22:27.710 --> 22:31.110
<i>I wouldn't have
to go more than once a day.</i>

22:31.110 --> 22:35.580
<i>The upside to that is we'd
make it farther without stopping.</i>

22:36.250 --> 22:39.550
<i>But the downside is discomfort.</i>

22:41.720 --> 22:44.290
<i>And that it could lead
to more swelling in my legs.</i>

22:46.990 --> 22:50.300
<i>Seeing Dr. Now
could save my life.</i>

22:50.300 --> 22:52.400
<i>But the trip to Houston
could kill me.</i>

23:02.840 --> 23:04.040
It's a nice car.

23:04.640 --> 23:05.780
[Tavaris] Yeah.

23:05.780 --> 23:07.680
- So you take care.
- [Larry] All right, you, too.

23:07.680 --> 23:09.280
- [Larry] Thank you.
- You're welcome.

Can you stop at the next place?

23:26.200 --> 23:29.070
[Tavaris] Yeah, I guess
so, man. I guess so.

23:29.970 --> 23:31.300
What do you mean you guess?
I'm hungry.

23:31.310 --> 23:33.210
[Tavaris] All right, all
right, brother, calm down.

23:33.210 --> 23:34.870
I'll feed you.

24:41.640 --> 24:43.940
[Tavaris] So, you can
get up out of here.

24:43.950 --> 24:46.310
- All right, thank you so much.
- [Tavaris] No problem.

24:48.850 --> 24:50.880
[Tavaris] I'm going to see if they
got a wheelchair for you, all right?

24:50.890 --> 24:52.180
[Larry] Yes, sir.

'cause I'm exhausted.

25:40.030 --> 25:41.600
Your keys are right here.

25:41.600 --> 25:42.970
All right, thank you.

25:42.970 --> 25:45.140
And I'll see you in the morning.

25:45.140 --> 25:48.810
- All right, you need anything else?
- No, I'm good. Thank you.

25:48.810 --> 25:53.410
Got a long ways to go tomorrow,
man, so, uh, get some rest.

25:53.410 --> 25:55.110
- [Larry] Yes, sir.
- All right.

26:00.120 --> 26:02.150
<i>[Larry] A lot of emotions
going through my mind.</i>

26:02.160 --> 26:05.320
Hoping and praying
that Dr. Now can help me.

26:06.560 --> 26:09.960
'Cause I can't take it
living like this. It's too much.

26:15.770 --> 26:19.140
I'd rather be six feet under
than to live like this.

26:28.880 --> 26:30.780
[Larry] The fat boys' road trip.

26:30.790 --> 26:33.250
One last hoorah!

26:33.250 --> 26:35.920
All right, they should've took
us down in one of these, man.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.220
[Tavaris] One of what?

26:38.190 --> 26:39.890
[Larry] One of these
oversized load trucks.

26:39.890 --> 26:41.690
You know what, Tavaris?
[chuckling]

26:41.700 --> 26:43.200
- [Larry] Don't do it.
- [Tavaris laughs]

26:43.200 --> 26:45.900
[Larry] I'm already
in excruciating pain.

26:45.900 --> 26:52.040
<i>Today is the last day
of this long road trip.</i>

26:52.040 --> 26:54.910
<i>This ride's a journey.</i>

26:54.910 --> 26:56.980
<i>And I'm determined
to get to Houston.</i>

26:58.110 --> 27:00.380
<i>My face is buried in the seat.</i>

27:00.380 --> 27:02.980
<i>I'm laying on a swollen leg.</i>

27:02.980 --> 27:04.580
<i>Sideways.</i>

27:04.590 --> 27:08.620
<i>Halfway on, halfway off,
'cause I can't fit on those.</i>

27:08.620 --> 27:11.460
<i>Then I have to lay on my side</i>

27:11.460 --> 27:14.490
<i>because of the lymphedema
in this leg, so it's a mess.</i>

27:16.130 --> 27:18.100
Ow. Ow.

27:18.100 --> 27:20.470
I am so uncomfortable.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.940
[Tavaris] Suck it up, buttercup.

27:25.940 --> 27:28.010
[Larry sneers]

27:28.010 --> 27:29.040
Ow.

27:29.040 --> 27:30.210
[Larry groans]

27:33.010 --> 27:33.980
[Tavaris] You all right?

27:33.980 --> 27:34.910
[Larry] It feels like...

27:36.050 --> 27:39.020
It feels like it could
be a DVT in my leg.

27:40.990 --> 27:43.560
'Cause I know what it feels,
I know what it feels like.

27:43.560 --> 27:48.590
It's like a jumping pain,
where it feels like fire, almost.

27:48.600 --> 27:52.200
It's... Something's wrong
and it needs to be addressed.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.100
My sister died
from a blood clot,

27:54.100 --> 27:55.430
and I don't wanna die from one.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.140
[Larry] Ow.

27:59.070 --> 28:01.040
Ow, Jesus.

28:01.040 --> 28:03.980
My pain right now
is at like a nine-and-a-half.

28:07.280 --> 28:09.180
[Larry groans]

28:10.620 --> 28:12.320
This is hurting so bad.

28:14.290 --> 28:17.890
Maybe I should just try
to roll over a little bit more.

28:17.890 --> 28:19.190
[Larry groans]

28:19.190 --> 28:21.090
Okay.

28:21.100 --> 28:22.160
[Larry groans]

28:23.900 --> 28:26.300
Ooh, oh, my God.

28:28.100 --> 28:29.200
Uh-oh.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.970
[Larry panting]

28:33.910 --> 28:35.310
- [Tavaris] You all right?
- [Larry] One second.

28:35.310 --> 28:37.380
[Larry exhales]

28:39.310 --> 28:41.850
You're killing me. Push it.

28:41.850 --> 28:43.120
There it is again.

28:46.120 --> 28:47.390
[Larry groans]

28:49.860 --> 28:50.990
[Larry exhales]

28:51.120 --> 28:53.160
[Larry exhales]

28:53.160 --> 28:56.300
[Larry] Lord, please don't
let me fall out of this door.

28:56.300 --> 28:57.560
[Larry groans]

28:59.230 --> 29:02.070
[Larry]
<i>It's excruciating pain.</i>

29:02.070 --> 29:05.240
<i>I mean, I knew
it was gonna be a hectic ride,</i>

29:05.240 --> 29:07.370
<i>but I didn't know that it
was gonna be like this.</i>

29:07.370 --> 29:08.570
<i>This is war.</i>

29:11.080 --> 29:13.110
<i>This is the last hope.</i>

29:28.730 --> 29:32.060
I'm expecting Larry to arrive
at the hospital pretty soon.

29:32.070 --> 29:34.600
<i>He called me and told me
he's having problems</i>

29:34.600 --> 29:36.940
<i>because he's been
on the road for five days.</i>

29:36.940 --> 29:40.670
He's almost to Houston and
that he's coming from New York.

29:40.670 --> 29:43.810
He's having a lot of issues
with the pain from the trip.

29:43.810 --> 29:48.050
Particularly in his leg,
and that is very concerning.

29:48.050 --> 29:51.980
<i>So, my concern in these
situations are blood clots</i>

29:51.990 --> 29:53.990
that can be devastating for him.

29:53.990 --> 29:57.760
<i>So, I advised Larry to come
to the hospital directly,</i>

29:57.760 --> 29:59.860
so we can check him
and make sure

29:59.860 --> 30:01.690
there is nothing acute
going on with him

30:01.700 --> 30:04.100
<i>that could be life-threatening
right now.</i>

30:04.860 --> 30:06.770
- [Larry] Hello.
- [Dr. Now] Hi, Larry.

30:06.770 --> 30:09.270
- How you doing?
- All right, nice to meet you.

30:09.270 --> 30:11.170
Nice to meet you.
How you feeling?

30:11.170 --> 30:13.110
Not too good, Doctor.

30:13.110 --> 30:14.340
[Dr. Now] Where are
you hurting?

30:15.180 --> 30:17.880
In the upper part of my leg.

30:17.880 --> 30:19.140
The back and the front.

30:19.150 --> 30:22.610
Not just from
the long-distance ride.

30:22.620 --> 30:27.120
It feels more like, um, like
when I had a DVT in the past.

30:27.120 --> 30:31.760
'Cause it's like a popping
and it's tremendously burning.

30:31.760 --> 30:34.830
- [Dr. Now] Okay, and are you short of breath at all?
- No, sir.

30:34.830 --> 30:38.000
Okay, and we're
gonna get you inside fast,

30:38.000 --> 30:41.730
- and, um, check you out and see what's going on, okay?
- [Larry] Yes, sir.

30:41.740 --> 30:43.000
Okay.

30:53.210 --> 30:55.150
This trip is very dangerous
for Larry

30:55.150 --> 31:00.920
<i>because at Larry's size and
with his overall lack of activity,</i>

31:00.920 --> 31:04.020
<i>a blood clot can easily form
in the legs.</i>

31:04.020 --> 31:07.560
<i>And if it dislodges
from sudden activity,</i>

31:07.560 --> 31:10.230
<i>it can travel
in the bloodstream...</i>

31:15.540 --> 31:18.000
<i>from his leg
into the heart and lung</i>

31:18.010 --> 31:21.070
and causing pulmonary
embolism that can be devastating

31:21.080 --> 31:23.210
and can be fatal in some cases.

31:23.210 --> 31:26.210
<i>So, we're gonna take him in
and do some tests,</i>

31:26.210 --> 31:28.950
<i>so we can determine
if there is anything</i>

31:28.950 --> 31:31.080
<i>we need to address immediately.</i>

31:31.090 --> 31:33.990
<i>If there is
and we don't act fast,</i>

31:33.990 --> 31:36.220
his life is gonna be
in jeopardy.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.100
[Larry] That's better,
thank you.

31:48.600 --> 31:52.070
- Larry, which leg is bothering you most?
- This leg.

31:52.070 --> 31:54.240
- Is that the one?
- Yes, sir.

31:54.240 --> 31:58.140
I could take my pants off
if I have a sheet.

31:58.150 --> 32:00.080
[exhales] It hurts so bad.

32:02.020 --> 32:03.180
[Dr. Now] So how old are you?

32:03.850 --> 32:05.880
I am 45.

32:05.890 --> 32:07.450
All right,
so, do you live at home?

32:07.450 --> 32:08.720
I live at home.

32:08.720 --> 32:15.260
I have a home health aid that
comes and, um, is an enabler.

32:15.260 --> 32:18.030
'Cause certain things I could do
for myself, I'm being honest with you,

32:18.030 --> 32:20.130
certain things
I could do for myself,

32:20.130 --> 32:23.600
he, uh, I call on him
to do it for me

32:23.600 --> 32:26.170
and I just, I'm tired, Doctor,

32:26.170 --> 32:29.210
and I don't
wanna live like that.

32:29.210 --> 32:31.110
That's not a normal way to live.

32:31.110 --> 32:33.010
How do you get the food?
They bring you food?

32:33.010 --> 32:34.110
He brings me food.

32:34.110 --> 32:36.950
I'll go in the kitchen
and I'll sit in a chair

32:36.950 --> 32:39.580
and cook the food
in my air fryer.

32:39.590 --> 32:42.920
And that's not normal
to just eat like that.

32:42.920 --> 32:45.790
Sometime I eat
and I'm not even hungry.

32:45.790 --> 32:48.630
- So, you don't work?
- No, sir.

32:48.630 --> 32:51.160
- You're on disability?
- Yes, sir.

32:51.170 --> 32:54.630
I used to sing professionally
in London and Denmark.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.100
And you're not able to walk?

32:57.100 --> 33:01.670
[stammers] I can walk some.
It's just, right now my leg hurts.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.010
[Dr. Now] And this is
something new?

33:03.010 --> 33:05.710
- As far as the pain in my leg?
- [Dr. Now] Yeah.

33:05.710 --> 33:08.750
[Larry] Yes. You gonna
have some pain in life.

33:08.750 --> 33:12.920
But this pain that I have is
much different and it hurts.

33:12.920 --> 33:15.220
- [Larry] It hurts.
- Where do you feel the pain?

33:15.220 --> 33:18.890
In the... In the upper part
of my leg.

33:18.890 --> 33:21.930
- It feels like...
- Is it this area?

33:21.930 --> 33:25.100
A little, a little bit more over
to the side where it's hard...

33:25.100 --> 33:27.300
- Right here?
- Yes, sir.

33:27.300 --> 33:30.570
But you have the big
lymphedema mass in here.

33:30.570 --> 33:31.970
- Yes.
- That's all a bump.

33:31.970 --> 33:35.170
And I had that removed
too, and it grew back.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.380
Well, of course
that will grow back.

33:37.380 --> 33:40.210
So how long ago did you have
that removed?

33:41.280 --> 33:43.120
About six years ago.

33:43.120 --> 33:45.450
Did you have,
uh, any other operation?

33:45.450 --> 33:46.850
- Yes.
- What did you have?

33:46.850 --> 33:52.390
I had a sleeve.
I had a, um, hernia operation

33:52.390 --> 33:56.030
and just normal, like, tonsils
and stuff like that.

33:56.030 --> 33:57.900
When was the sleeve done?

33:57.900 --> 34:00.700
Like close to 15, 16 years ago.

34:00.700 --> 34:03.200
And, uh, how much
you weighed then?

34:04.000 --> 34:06.610
Um, what did I go down to,
or how much--

34:06.610 --> 34:08.510
No, how much you weighed
before surgery?

34:08.510 --> 34:12.780
Like close to 600
and some change.

34:12.780 --> 34:14.280
600?

34:14.280 --> 34:15.950
What was the lowest weight
you got to?

34:15.950 --> 34:17.120
302.

34:17.120 --> 34:18.580
And how much your weight now?

34:18.590 --> 34:20.250
I don't know.

34:20.250 --> 34:21.550
You have no idea.

34:21.560 --> 34:22.650
- No.
- Okay.

34:22.660 --> 34:24.590
And you have a filter put in?

34:24.590 --> 34:29.060
Two Greenfield filters 'cause
my sister died from a blood clot.

34:29.060 --> 34:33.730
And my daddy was just in the
hospital two weeks ago with a DVT.

34:33.730 --> 34:35.870
So they run in my family.

34:35.870 --> 34:38.370
Okay, so you had
two filters put in?

34:38.370 --> 34:39.970
Two filters, yes,
one in each hip.

34:39.970 --> 34:41.170
How long ago was that?

34:41.180 --> 34:42.410
That was about...

34:43.580 --> 34:45.610
ten years ago,
after Cathy died.

34:45.610 --> 34:47.310
Okay.

34:47.310 --> 34:52.620
- And the surgery that they did was, uh, laparoscopically.
- Yes, laparoscopic.

34:52.620 --> 34:53.820
[Dr. Now] Okay.

34:53.820 --> 34:56.990
- You don't have any stomach pain or anything?
- No, sir.

34:56.990 --> 35:00.030
[Dr. Now] What was your
highest weight before the surgery?

35:00.030 --> 35:03.830
[Larry Myers] I used
to weigh 940 pounds.

35:03.830 --> 35:06.930
And I'm scared, Doctor. I
don't wanna go back up to that.

35:06.930 --> 35:08.370
[Dr. Now] When was that?

35:09.500 --> 35:11.840
That was close to 20 years ago.

35:11.840 --> 35:15.310
- Okay, that was before you had your weight-loss surgery?
- Yes.

35:15.310 --> 35:17.980
I couldn't walk.
I was bed-bound.

35:17.980 --> 35:19.710
[Dr. Now] So what happened?

35:19.710 --> 35:21.910
You had weight-loss surgery.
You're supposed to lose weight.

35:21.920 --> 35:25.850
- What happened?
- I did, but I have a problem with food.

35:25.850 --> 35:28.220
So what kind of problem
you have with food?

35:30.290 --> 35:32.590
Sometimes I just eat,
and I'm not hungry.

35:32.590 --> 35:34.230
And I, um...

35:36.060 --> 35:39.130
This is a battle.
It's an ongoing battle for me.

35:39.130 --> 35:40.000
And...

35:41.200 --> 35:43.470
they never
took care of why I eat.

35:43.470 --> 35:45.040
Sometimes I eat,
and I'm not even hungry.

35:45.040 --> 35:46.510
Okay.

35:46.510 --> 35:49.070
[Larry] And I know you might
say that doesn't make sense,

35:49.080 --> 35:52.780
but, um, when you suffer with
deep depression the way that I do,

35:52.780 --> 35:55.180
I just turn to food.

35:55.180 --> 35:58.080
[Dr. Now] You're not
the first person to do that.

35:58.090 --> 36:00.090
Any other issues
you have right now?

36:00.090 --> 36:01.290
Not urinating.

36:01.290 --> 36:05.620
Albany's very far from
Houston, and I'm not urinating.

36:05.630 --> 36:07.990
I explained I didn't get
out of the car

36:08.000 --> 36:11.630
'cause I don't like public
bathrooms. I'm germophobic.

36:11.630 --> 36:14.100
I realized
that I wasn't urinating.

36:14.100 --> 36:17.000
All right, well, we'll check
everything and see what's going on

36:17.000 --> 36:17.940
with your leg, okay?

36:17.940 --> 36:20.070
- All right, thank you.
- Okay.

36:29.820 --> 36:31.680
[Dr. Now] <i>We ran
some tests on him,</i>

36:31.690 --> 36:33.590
<i>and fortunately,
everything is normal.</i>

36:33.590 --> 36:37.320
I think Larry has been
in the car for five days,

36:37.320 --> 36:41.390
<i>and he's worn out, and his leg
got sore, and it got some swelling.</i>

36:41.400 --> 36:44.100
We can give him some
medication and let him rest,

36:44.100 --> 36:46.300
<i>and then send him home.</i>

36:46.300 --> 36:48.870
- [groans]
- Okay, Larry, how you feeling?

36:48.870 --> 36:49.970
[Larry] Great.

36:49.970 --> 36:51.240
[Dr. Now] I got
good news for you.

36:51.240 --> 36:53.870
All your lab looked perfect.

36:53.870 --> 36:56.580
- Excellent.
- So all you need, just rest.

36:56.580 --> 36:58.780
Part of your lab report
is back...

36:58.780 --> 37:01.080
- Mm-hmm.
- and white count is not elevated...

37:01.080 --> 37:02.580
- And that's good.
- which is good.

37:02.580 --> 37:04.150
So you don't have any subliners.

37:04.150 --> 37:06.020
You're gonna be fine.

37:06.020 --> 37:09.960
You're traveling five days and
ten hours, every day in a car.

37:09.960 --> 37:12.860
- It's gonna cause you a lot of pain and discomfort.
- Right.

37:12.860 --> 37:15.690
And, you know,
with your size of leg...

37:15.700 --> 37:20.100
So this, um, you know,
situation when you travel,

37:20.100 --> 37:23.970
the planning for that is starting
a blood thinner before you travel.

37:23.970 --> 37:26.270
Oh, I didn't do that.

37:26.270 --> 37:28.870
So that is something
that you should've done

37:28.880 --> 37:30.940
if you gonna travel
in the car...

37:30.940 --> 37:32.810
- Okay.
- or even with a plane, too.

37:32.810 --> 37:34.810
- [Larry] Really?
- So... Mm, uh, yeah.

37:34.820 --> 37:39.050
- Because you put your leg down and brought the stagger down.
- Right.

37:39.050 --> 37:41.990
- And that will have a tendency to form clots.
- Makes sense.

37:41.990 --> 37:44.960
So blood thinner
before any kind of travel

37:44.960 --> 37:48.130
is very important
part of your well being

37:48.130 --> 37:50.060
that you should be
aware of that, okay?

37:50.060 --> 37:51.860
I understand that.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.100
So what actually you coming
to Houston for?

37:54.100 --> 37:58.200
I am terrified of dying,

37:59.410 --> 38:04.610
of being buried...
And I'm Pentecostal.

38:04.610 --> 38:06.880
And in my religion...
My dad is a pastor.

38:06.880 --> 38:09.650
And in my religion,
we don't believe in cremation.

38:09.650 --> 38:12.280
And when I was
even bigger than this,

38:12.290 --> 38:17.790
I did my research online on what
they bury a person in of my size,

38:17.790 --> 38:20.230
and it looked like a piano box.

38:20.230 --> 38:26.000
And I'm terrified of putting
on more weight and eating.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
And I just...

38:29.000 --> 38:33.270
I'm at my ends, Doctor, and
I don't know what else to do.

38:33.270 --> 38:36.540
And me relocating, losing...

38:37.140 --> 38:40.010
my house in New York.

38:40.010 --> 38:45.280
I'm willing to do that and start
all over again, even struggle...

38:45.290 --> 38:49.750
to lose weight 'cause I'm
very uncomfortable like this.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.260
Well, I understand that.

38:51.260 --> 38:55.690
But, you know, the
weight-loss surgery is not--

38:55.700 --> 38:57.900
It's not a quick fix.
I know that.

38:57.900 --> 39:00.930
And you already had
your weight-loss surgery.

39:00.930 --> 39:03.970
And you still are overeating.

39:03.970 --> 39:06.640
So those are issues that
surgery's not gonna change.

39:06.640 --> 39:08.110
Right.

39:08.110 --> 39:11.980
So you think that changing the
environment is gonna help you?

39:11.980 --> 39:13.880
No, not so much...

39:13.880 --> 39:17.320
Well, that and changing
the environment,

39:17.320 --> 39:22.220
and from looking at your track
record of how you help people,

39:22.220 --> 39:25.220
physically and mentally.

39:25.230 --> 39:28.060
I just know that me, personally,

39:28.060 --> 39:31.160
I am completely desperate
for help.

39:31.160 --> 39:34.600
All right, if you are
so terrified of dying,

39:34.600 --> 39:37.400
then you should be terrified
of overeating.

39:37.400 --> 39:38.670
Makes sense.

39:38.670 --> 39:41.570
And I'm kinda puzzled.

39:41.580 --> 39:45.410
So it seems like you know what
you're doing, and you doing it,

39:45.410 --> 39:49.250
and you're convincing yourself
that you cannot stop doing that?

39:49.250 --> 39:53.590
And that doesn't sound rational,

39:53.590 --> 39:56.050
but it's the truth.

39:56.060 --> 39:59.690
But at this point,
what is new today,

39:59.690 --> 40:00.930
and what are you willing to do?

40:00.930 --> 40:04.360
I'm willing to do anything
that I have to do

40:04.360 --> 40:06.630
- to try-- - Come on, you
know what you have to do

40:06.630 --> 40:09.000
is eat less and don't overeat.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.140
- So are you willing to make the changes?
- Yes, I am.

40:12.140 --> 40:14.570
So why haven't you done
that so far?

40:14.570 --> 40:16.240
I don't have an honest answer,

40:16.240 --> 40:19.010
and I believe in being
straightforward and honest with people.

40:19.010 --> 40:21.750
I don't know why I
haven't done the change.

40:21.750 --> 40:23.520
And I know that I should.

40:23.520 --> 40:26.350
You're defeating the purpose
of the operation.

40:26.350 --> 40:30.290
So the operation is working,
and you're just eating more often.

40:30.290 --> 40:31.090
Right.

40:31.090 --> 40:35.160
So that's,
uh, totally up to you.

40:35.160 --> 40:39.130
And this is something that you're
gonna have to decide to change, so...

40:39.130 --> 40:41.870
But I don't know how to do that.

40:41.870 --> 40:43.800
- And I'm trying.
- All right.

40:43.800 --> 40:45.070
I'm 45.

40:45.070 --> 40:48.870
I abuse food, but I've
never smoked, never drank,

40:48.880 --> 40:52.180
never did any type of drugs
a day in my life.

40:52.180 --> 40:56.010
Good. We got your weight,
and you're 648.

40:56.020 --> 40:57.880
So if you want to do my program,

40:57.880 --> 40:59.950
then you can come back
in a month.

40:59.950 --> 41:03.120
And I want you to lose
50 pounds by then.

41:03.120 --> 41:04.720
You think you can do that?

41:04.720 --> 41:06.260
Yes.

41:06.260 --> 41:07.830
All right, so you get
to go on home.

41:07.830 --> 41:08.990
- Okay.
- Okay?

41:09.000 --> 41:11.960
- Thank you, Doctor.
- All right.

41:11.970 --> 41:17.270
<i>[Dr. Now] We'll see if Larry is
serious this time about his weight loss.</i>

41:17.270 --> 41:20.840
<i>But the fact that he has
already failed weight-loss surgery</i>

41:20.840 --> 41:22.210
<i>is a big concern.</i>

41:22.210 --> 41:25.740
<i>He's clearly going to need
a lot psychotherapy</i>

41:25.750 --> 41:28.180
<i>to be successful
in the long term.</i>

41:28.180 --> 41:32.620
<i>But he needs to take the first
step to show me he is serious</i>

41:32.620 --> 41:37.420
<i>if he wants to move ahead with my
program and get a second chance.</i>

41:37.420 --> 41:40.460
<i>Hopefully, he is serious,
and he does that.</i>

41:56.910 --> 41:58.580
Are you ready?

41:58.580 --> 41:59.840
[Larry] Yes, I'm ready, Mama.

41:59.850 --> 42:03.310
[Daisy] So it may not look
like it's the best meal.

42:03.320 --> 42:04.850
However, it's healthy.

42:04.850 --> 42:06.550
Oh, yes, thank you.

42:06.550 --> 42:08.820
<i>[Larry] I'm still down
in Houston.</i>

42:08.820 --> 42:11.990
<i>I've been staying at my uncle and
cousin's house for the past month.</i>

42:11.990 --> 42:15.790
<i>It took me a while to recover
from the trip down here.</i>

42:15.800 --> 42:19.860
<i>And the pain didn't fully stop
until about two weeks ago.</i>

42:19.870 --> 42:23.130
<i>So I'm not looking forward
to doing that trip again.</i>

42:25.040 --> 42:29.340
<i>Tavaris went back home, so my cousin's
been helping me and looking after me.</i>

42:30.210 --> 42:31.080
I'm finished.

42:31.080 --> 42:32.880
Okay.

42:32.880 --> 42:36.280
[Larry] <i>And I've been working
hard since I've seen Dr. Now</i>

42:36.280 --> 42:38.120
<i>to lose 50 pounds like he said.</i>

42:40.890 --> 42:44.020
[Larry] So I have to start thinking
about how am I going to move.

42:44.460 --> 42:45.420
[Daisy speaking]

42:47.030 --> 42:49.190
I mean, I was kinda wondering...

42:49.930 --> 42:51.930
Would you happen
to have room for me here?

42:51.930 --> 42:53.900
How is this gonna go?

42:53.900 --> 42:57.600
Well, especially now that I've
seen you're beautiful apartment.

42:57.600 --> 42:59.100
Yes, but I have
my two little ones.

42:59.110 --> 43:00.470
- You know, my babies, I have...
- That's right.

43:00.970 --> 43:04.140
my two little girls, and, you
know, it's a two bedroom, and...

43:04.140 --> 43:06.280
I can help you find a place.

43:08.310 --> 43:11.950
- Okay.
- Because they do have some vacancies over here

43:11.950 --> 43:14.920
if you wanna still be close by me
if you're looking for your support,

43:14.920 --> 43:18.590
and, you know, I can
always be there to help you.

43:18.590 --> 43:20.930
- I appreciate that.
- You can tell me anything that you doing positive.

43:20.930 --> 43:22.790
- Thank you.
- I'm 110% behind you.

43:22.800 --> 43:25.000
- Thank you.
- Okay?

43:25.000 --> 43:27.600
<i>[Larry] I'm disappointed that
they won't let me stay with them.</i>

43:29.370 --> 43:31.370
<i>I know I can be a burden.</i>

43:32.870 --> 43:36.570
<i>But this is to save my life, and I
wished they could've seen that.</i>

43:36.580 --> 43:38.710
<i>But I need Dr. Now's help.</i>

43:38.710 --> 43:41.910
<i>And I know
I can't keep doing that trip.</i>

43:41.920 --> 43:46.550
<i>So I guess that means I have to find
somewhere else to live down here for myself.</i>

43:54.430 --> 43:56.560
I'm terrified.

43:56.560 --> 43:58.930
[Daisy] Of what?

43:58.930 --> 44:00.000
What you scared of?

44:00.970 --> 44:02.830
Scale.

44:02.840 --> 44:03.900
[Daisy] But you know
you got a chance

44:03.900 --> 44:05.000
that you can do something
about it.

44:05.010 --> 44:07.010
- You don't have to stay that size, right?
- Right.

44:07.010 --> 44:09.140
[Daisy] You know, the only thing
you can do is just keep moving.

44:09.140 --> 44:10.710
You know, make your next meal
your best meal.

44:10.710 --> 44:11.610
Make it better, you know.

44:11.610 --> 44:13.580
Nobody's expecting
a miracle overnight.

44:13.580 --> 44:16.150
And in order for you to change,
you gotta wanna change,

44:16.150 --> 44:18.020
and it starts here, baby.

44:21.090 --> 44:23.620
<i>[Larry] Today, I'm back
to see Dr. Now.</i>

44:23.620 --> 44:26.890
<i>I'm hoping I made the progress
that I'm supposed to make</i>

44:26.890 --> 44:29.030
<i>in order to get approved
for weight-loss surgery.</i>

44:29.030 --> 44:30.960
[Daisy] There you go.

44:35.370 --> 44:37.270
[Daisy] You can make it
to that door.

44:37.270 --> 44:39.000
- Push yourself.
- Let's go!

44:39.010 --> 44:41.670
All right, you go it.
Let's go. Come on.

44:41.680 --> 44:43.940
All right, look at that.

44:43.940 --> 44:46.910
[Daisy] Take your life back.
It's a start.

44:46.910 --> 44:48.580
<i>[Larry] My plan
is to get approved.</i>

44:48.580 --> 44:51.050
<i>And once I know
I'm getting surgery,</i>

44:51.050 --> 44:53.480
<i>then I can find a place
to live down there.</i>

44:53.490 --> 44:55.790
<i>And I don't have to do
that drive anymore.</i>

44:55.790 --> 44:57.120
Larry.

45:05.100 --> 45:07.870
<i>[Larry] So I was 648 pounds.</i>

45:07.870 --> 45:10.200
<i>And I needed to lose 50 pounds.</i>

45:10.200 --> 45:13.840
<i>So that means
today I should be at 598.</i>

45:13.840 --> 45:16.040
<i>And I'm really hoping
that I did that.</i>

45:20.580 --> 45:22.310
[nurse] You're weight is 639.

45:35.860 --> 45:37.100
I'm ready.

45:42.070 --> 45:44.040
<i>[Larry] That's
really upsetting to see.</i>

45:44.970 --> 45:46.470
<i>Very upsetting.</i>

45:49.680 --> 45:52.540
<i>I was expecting
a lot better than that.</i>

45:55.950 --> 46:00.120
<i>So I guess I can forget about
any type of surgery approval today.</i>

46:05.020 --> 46:06.990
- [knocking on door]
- Come in.

46:09.960 --> 46:11.130
Hello, how y'all doing?

46:11.130 --> 46:13.130
- Hi.
- All right. How are you?

46:13.130 --> 46:15.270
I'm doing well, thank you.

46:15.270 --> 46:17.740
So, Larry,
good to see you again.

46:17.740 --> 46:18.800
[Larry] Thank you, Doctor.

46:18.810 --> 46:21.110
All right, who is this
young lady with you?

46:21.110 --> 46:23.710
My cousin.
I have family in Houston.

46:23.710 --> 46:25.140
Yes, yes.

46:25.150 --> 46:26.510
[Dr. Now] Well,
nice to meet you.

46:26.510 --> 46:31.020
All right, so wow, you've got
matching shoes with your outfit, huh?

46:31.020 --> 46:33.820
- I had to get dressed up to come see you.
- Oh, well, thank you.

46:33.820 --> 46:35.220
[Dr. Now] I appreciate that.

46:35.220 --> 46:39.290
So, Larry, you only lost
10 pounds this month.

46:39.290 --> 46:40.930
So how do you think you did?

46:40.930 --> 46:42.130
Not good, Doctor.

46:42.130 --> 46:43.830
All right, be more specific.

46:43.830 --> 46:46.130
Not good with the weight.

46:46.130 --> 46:49.000
Well, you know, you have had
weight-loss surgery.

46:49.000 --> 46:53.270
- Yes.
- And you have done everything to defeat the purpose of that.

46:53.270 --> 46:55.870
You had lymphedema
taken off your leg.

46:55.880 --> 46:58.410
You have done everything
to bring that back up.

46:58.410 --> 47:02.950
So you got all the tools that you
needed given to you in the past,

47:02.950 --> 47:05.580
and you didn't use them right.

47:05.590 --> 47:09.290
And everything that you have
done is being self-destructive.

47:09.290 --> 47:10.450
So why you doing that?

47:11.320 --> 47:12.420
'Cause I have a problem.

47:12.430 --> 47:13.960
What is your problem?

47:13.960 --> 47:15.860
Food.

47:15.860 --> 47:19.030
I mean, you have to eat to live,
but you don't have to overeat.

47:19.030 --> 47:21.930
And I have an addiction.

47:21.940 --> 47:24.770
- And-- - Well, you not the
only person to have an addiction.

47:24.770 --> 47:28.310
- No, I understand that.
- And you convincing that you have an addiction.

47:28.310 --> 47:31.180
You convincing yourself that
you have no choice but to overeat.

47:31.180 --> 47:32.940
[Dr. Now]
None of that's reality.

47:32.950 --> 47:36.880
You just convincing yourself
that you gotta continue to overeat,

47:36.880 --> 47:38.580
and you have no control over it.

47:38.590 --> 47:41.650
[Dr. Now] So this
is all just excuses.

47:41.650 --> 47:43.020
I understand.

47:43.020 --> 47:47.960
You know, Larry, I can tell
that your pretty smart, okay?

47:47.960 --> 47:52.600
But being smart and being
self-destructive is a bad combination.

47:52.600 --> 47:53.930
Right.

47:53.930 --> 47:57.030
So at this point, you have to
realize everything's up to you.

47:57.040 --> 48:00.300
You're the one that you have
to decide to change your life.

48:00.310 --> 48:02.240
We can't magically make
you do that.

48:02.240 --> 48:03.340
Right.

48:03.340 --> 48:05.880
So what are you willing to do
at this point?

48:05.880 --> 48:08.350
I'm desperate, Doctor.
I'll do anything

48:08.350 --> 48:09.850
that I have to do.

48:09.850 --> 48:12.150
Like I stated to you before,

48:12.150 --> 48:14.120
this is my last hope here.

48:14.120 --> 48:16.720
And I don't wanna die.

48:16.720 --> 48:18.860
And I know you can die
at any age.

48:18.860 --> 48:21.060
Well, you gonna die
because you're killing yourself.

48:21.060 --> 48:24.630
And I don't want to, so I'm willing
to do anything that I have to do

48:24.630 --> 48:26.900
to change my life
for the better.

48:26.900 --> 48:30.800
You say that, then you didn't
do the diet for the past month,

48:30.800 --> 48:32.300
and hardly lost any weight.

48:32.310 --> 48:34.110
And until you take
the first step,

48:34.110 --> 48:37.780
and show that you're taking
responsibility for yourself,

48:37.780 --> 48:40.040
there is nothing we can do
to help you.

48:40.050 --> 48:42.650
So do you think
you're ready to do that?

48:42.650 --> 48:43.810
[Larry] I'm ready.

48:43.820 --> 48:46.350
And you're gonna have to
control your eating habit.

48:46.350 --> 48:48.090
And I'm sure you can do that.

48:48.090 --> 48:50.020
With God's grace and mercy.

48:50.020 --> 48:51.990
- [Dr. Now] Okay?
- Thank you.

48:51.990 --> 48:56.190
All right, then you need to make
right choices before it's too late.

48:56.200 --> 48:59.060
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, and if you need anything, give me a call.

48:59.070 --> 49:00.230
Thank you, Doctor.

49:00.230 --> 49:03.130
All right, Larry,
I got great hopes for you

49:03.140 --> 49:04.270
that you're gonna change
your life.

49:04.270 --> 49:05.740
- So...
- I appreciate it.

49:05.740 --> 49:07.140
don't disappoint me.

49:07.140 --> 49:10.270
-[Larry] I won't. Trust me.
[chuckles] -[Daisy whispers] He won't.

49:10.280 --> 49:14.310
All right, so if you have
any issues, give me a call.

49:14.310 --> 49:16.150
- I will.
- And then we go from there.

49:16.150 --> 49:17.320
Yes, sir.

49:17.320 --> 49:18.880
- See you later.
- [Larry] See you later.

49:18.890 --> 49:19.620
Bye, bye.

49:19.620 --> 49:21.220
[Dr. Now] Bye.

49:26.220 --> 49:29.290
<i>[Dr. Now] I was disappointed
to see such little progress</i>

49:29.300 --> 49:31.200
<i>from Larry over the past month.</i>

49:31.200 --> 49:35.870
He says he's ready to change and
do whatever he needs to get healthy

49:35.870 --> 49:38.170
<i>because he knows
this is his last chance</i>

49:38.170 --> 49:42.140
<i>after failing one
weight-loss surgery already.</i>

49:42.140 --> 49:46.580
But so far, he's shown me no
evidence that he means what he says.

49:46.580 --> 49:50.450
<i>And until he does that, there
is nothing we can do to help him</i>

49:50.450 --> 49:54.790
<i>because he's already been given
every tool possible to lose weight.</i>

49:54.790 --> 50:00.360
<i>So until he decides to take that first
step, we won't be moving forward with him.</i>

50:05.100 --> 50:07.700
<i>[Larry] I'm not happy
with myself.</i>

50:07.700 --> 50:09.930
<i>I thought I'd done
better than that.</i>

50:09.940 --> 50:11.570
<i>But I'm not gonna give excuses.</i>

50:13.870 --> 50:15.910
<i>[Larry] I'm gonna get back
to New York,</i>

50:15.910 --> 50:17.940
<i>and then I'm gonna work
on getting my weight down</i>

50:17.940 --> 50:19.440
<i>to hit that goal.</i>

50:19.450 --> 50:22.550
<i>It's a lot to lose,
but I'm going to do it.</i>

50:23.920 --> 50:27.320
<i>And I'm just overwhelmed. I
can't wait to get back to Houston</i>

50:27.320 --> 50:30.350
'cause I believe that
I see a change coming.

50:48.940 --> 50:52.610
Oh, Dear Heavenly Father,
we come before you this morning

50:52.610 --> 50:56.950
as humble as we know how, thanking and
praising you, God, for allowing us to live,

50:56.950 --> 51:00.150
to see another day that
we've never seen before, God.

51:00.150 --> 51:03.150
In Jesus' name we pray,
and we thank you today, God.

51:03.990 --> 51:05.320
Amen.

51:06.360 --> 51:08.230
- [exhales]
- [Lawrence] Okay. You ready?

51:08.730 --> 51:10.260
Yes. All right.

51:11.760 --> 51:13.530
<i>[Larry] I've been back a month.</i>

51:13.530 --> 51:19.240
<i>And I have another two months before
it's time for me to go back to see Dr. Now.</i>

51:19.240 --> 51:21.910
<i>I thought maybe Tavaris was
gonna come get me.</i>

51:21.910 --> 51:25.410
<i>But he quit so I had
to fly back.</i>

51:27.380 --> 51:29.950
<i>But that turned out
to be a lot easier.</i>

51:31.420 --> 51:33.750
<i>But I'm thinking about
going back early</i>

51:33.750 --> 51:35.990
<i>so I can find a place to live</i>

51:35.990 --> 51:38.120
<i>because I wanna move to Houston</i>

51:38.120 --> 51:41.160
<i>and be officially part
of Dr. Now's program.</i>

51:41.890 --> 51:45.000
<i>And my priority is
to prove to Dr. Now</i>

51:45.000 --> 51:48.330
<i>that I deserve a second chance
to get weight-loss surgery.</i>

51:53.810 --> 51:55.970
You wanna put your shirt on?

51:58.980 --> 52:02.050
<i>[Larry] So I'm trying to do
a lot better this time.</i>

52:02.050 --> 52:05.880
<i>I know I have to lose a lot so
I'm working hard to do that.</i>

52:05.890 --> 52:07.990
Is it me or is it
chilly in here?

52:08.590 --> 52:10.520
[Lawrence] It's not chilly
in here, man.

52:11.020 --> 52:12.790
It's you this time.

52:12.790 --> 52:15.860
Me this time? All righty.

52:15.860 --> 52:19.330
<i>It's just really hard 'cause
food is an addiction for me.</i>

52:20.970 --> 52:23.430
[Lawrence] Okay, sir.
Here's your breakfast.

52:24.100 --> 52:26.340
Let me put this
on the side over here.

52:27.810 --> 52:30.070
This is what 1200 calories
look like.

52:30.080 --> 52:32.310
This doesn't look like
my old breakfast.

52:33.250 --> 52:34.350
That's a lot.

52:35.010 --> 52:36.980
You think you have
too much on here?

52:39.380 --> 52:42.920
For what my calorie intake
is supposed to be,

52:42.920 --> 52:44.320
this is sufficient.

52:44.320 --> 52:46.120
Okay, sir.

52:48.090 --> 52:50.160
<i>[Larry] Food has a hold on me</i>

52:50.160 --> 52:53.200
<i>even though Dr. Now says
that's an excuse.</i>

52:55.800 --> 52:59.370
<i>It's hard to get free,
and every day is a struggle.</i>

53:01.010 --> 53:05.040
<i>But I've been doing the diet
and working at it.</i>

53:07.210 --> 53:11.250
<i>I do all of the exercises that
Dr. Now showed me.</i>

53:14.020 --> 53:16.820
<i>And I know when I get back
to seeing him,</i>

53:16.820 --> 53:19.590
<i>that I'm going to have
progress to show him.</i>

53:21.190 --> 53:23.430
<i>And that's when
I'll get approved.</i>

53:25.760 --> 53:28.200
<i>So I'm just working my very
hardest to do that</i>

53:29.940 --> 53:32.200
<i>and make sure that happens.</i>

53:32.870 --> 53:34.910
- Mr. Lawrence?
- [Lawrence] Yes, sir?

53:34.910 --> 53:37.580
- Can you set this on the table for me, please?
- [Lawrence] Yes, I will.

53:38.810 --> 53:40.410
- [Larry] Thank you.
- [Lawrence] You're welcome.

54:02.030 --> 54:04.670
<i>[Larry] I'm on my way
to see Dr. Now.</i>

54:04.670 --> 54:08.040
I'm excited about that. <i>I
haven't seen him in over 30 days.</i>

54:08.970 --> 54:11.810
<i>I'm very nervous to see
what the scale says.</i>

54:11.810 --> 54:14.580
<i>The scale doesn't lie.
People do.</i>

54:14.580 --> 54:18.080
<i>He said for me to lose
30 to 40 pounds.</i>

54:18.080 --> 54:20.020
<i>I think I've done that.</i>

54:20.020 --> 54:22.850
<i>I don't know.
We'll see what happens.</i>

54:22.860 --> 54:25.720
<i>I hope Dr. Now tells me,
"Good job, young man."</i>

54:25.730 --> 54:29.090
<i>I'm definitely motivated
to lose weight.</i>

54:29.100 --> 54:33.130
<i>I have the mindset and
the energy to change my life.</i>

54:40.340 --> 54:41.970
[Larry] Thank you.

54:42.140 --> 54:43.210
Thank you.

54:43.270 --> 54:44.510
That's fine.

54:45.780 --> 54:47.780
<i>I flew here by myself this time</i>

54:47.780 --> 54:50.480
<i>which was much more
comfortable than driving.</i>

54:51.780 --> 54:53.720
<i>But I'm also a lot lighter now.</i>

54:53.720 --> 54:56.290
<i>So I think that's helping me
get around better.</i>

54:58.190 --> 55:01.930
<i>I was going to come in early
to try to find a place.</i>

55:01.930 --> 55:05.000
<i>But then I decided
to wait because</i>

55:05.000 --> 55:09.200
<i>I would feel better about it if I
got my approval for surgery first.</i>

55:14.670 --> 55:16.870
Larry?

55:16.880 --> 55:20.480
<i>[Larry] So I'm hoping with all my
heart that Dr. Now approves me this time</i>

55:23.180 --> 55:27.220
<i>and that I made the progress I
need to show him that I'm ready.</i>

55:27.890 --> 55:31.660
<i>I was 639 pounds
at my last appointment</i>

55:31.660 --> 55:34.690
<i>and my goal was to lose
120 by today.</i>

55:34.690 --> 55:37.190
Okay. You can go ahead
and step on the scale.

55:37.200 --> 55:41.800
<i>[Larry] So if everything goes
according to plan, I'll be at 519.</i>

55:41.800 --> 55:44.600
<i>I'm not sure if I made that
exactly but I know it's close.</i>

55:49.210 --> 55:51.240
[nurse] Okay.
Your weight is 602.

55:55.810 --> 55:56.980
<i>[Larry] What was that?</i>

55:59.180 --> 56:00.520
We're gonna go to room five.

56:00.520 --> 56:02.690
All right. I'm ready.

56:02.690 --> 56:06.160
<i>I'm upset with those results
'cause I know I did better than that.</i>

56:10.200 --> 56:12.600
<i>I definitely should have
lost more</i>

56:12.600 --> 56:15.600
<i>and I don't think Dr. Now
is gonna be impressed.</i>

56:18.840 --> 56:22.340
<i>And that's what has me really
scared and worried right now.</i>

56:27.250 --> 56:28.380
[knocking on door]

56:29.150 --> 56:30.480
[Larry] Come in.

56:31.580 --> 56:32.780
[exclaims]

56:32.790 --> 56:34.250
Hello. How you doing, Larry?

56:34.250 --> 56:35.890
I'm all right. How are you?

56:35.890 --> 56:37.860
I'm doing okay.

56:37.860 --> 56:39.520
So how was your trip down here?

56:39.530 --> 56:42.890
[Larry] Nice and smooth.
We flew.

56:42.900 --> 56:45.060
- [Larry] Long drive.
- Oh, you figured out how to do that?

56:45.060 --> 56:47.100
Yes.

56:47.100 --> 56:48.870
All right, Larry.
Let's see what you got.

56:48.870 --> 56:52.770
You lost, uh, 37 pounds
over 3 months which is

56:52.770 --> 56:55.110
12 to 13 pounds a month

56:55.110 --> 56:58.810
which isn't much more than
you were losing the first time.

56:58.810 --> 56:59.940
So what's going on?

56:59.950 --> 57:03.050
Did you make any more changes
to your eating habit?

57:04.080 --> 57:06.120
I stopped snacking.

57:06.120 --> 57:08.090
- [Dr. Now] Okay.
- And I cut the portions down.

57:08.090 --> 57:09.890
Okay.

57:09.890 --> 57:13.590
And I stopped all the cheese
and the bad stuff.

57:14.690 --> 57:16.790
- Okay.
- I'm still a little confused

57:16.800 --> 57:19.960
with how much protein am I
actually supposed to have.

57:19.970 --> 57:22.830
I don't wanna have
too less or too much.

57:22.840 --> 57:26.070
Okay. Whatever you eat,
it must be protein

57:26.070 --> 57:28.710
and to eat as little
as possible.

57:28.710 --> 57:29.840
- [chuckles]
- [Dr. Now] Okay?

57:29.840 --> 57:32.340
That's what I thought.
The less is better.

57:32.340 --> 57:36.180
Okay. So you already had
the one weight-loss surgery.

57:36.180 --> 57:37.710
Yes.

57:37.720 --> 57:41.650
And if you stick with the diet and make
all the changes you say you've made,

57:41.650 --> 57:45.720
then you should easily lose
50 to 60 pounds a month.

57:45.720 --> 57:49.690
- Okay.
- [Dr. Now] But you lost 37 pounds in 3 months.

57:49.700 --> 57:51.830
- So you need to do better with that...
- [Larry] Yes.

57:51.830 --> 57:54.770
and, um,
change your eating habit.

57:54.770 --> 57:57.570
Because, um,
second weight-loss surgery,

57:57.570 --> 58:00.140
the chances of success
are not very high.

58:00.140 --> 58:01.570
- I understand.
- [Dr. Now] Okay.

58:01.570 --> 58:03.810
So how's your activity now?

58:03.810 --> 58:07.080
- It's getting better day by day.
- [Dr. Now] Okay.

58:07.080 --> 58:09.110
You're doing those
exercises anymore?

58:09.110 --> 58:10.950
I'm doing the exercises
and I'm getting on the floor

58:10.950 --> 58:14.720
doing the exercises that you
gave me with TheraBand, too.

58:14.720 --> 58:17.090
[Dr. Now] Okay.
From what you describe,

58:17.090 --> 58:19.760
you wouldn't need to be
dependent on your walker anymore.

58:19.760 --> 58:23.960
You should have been doing all
that for the past few months.

58:23.960 --> 58:28.830
So you're still lying to yourself about
how much you're doing with everything

58:28.830 --> 58:31.130
and if you're not gonna make
the progress you should,

58:31.140 --> 58:35.870
then there is no point in coming back
down at your weight even if you're flying.

58:35.880 --> 58:37.010
Okay.

58:37.010 --> 58:38.780
[Dr. Now] So I'm gonna give
you the same goal.

58:38.780 --> 58:40.980
Lose 120 pounds in 3 months.

58:40.980 --> 58:44.920
But if you haven't moved down
here to Houston by then,

58:44.920 --> 58:48.190
we'll set up somewhere local
for you to check your weight

58:48.190 --> 58:50.090
and see how you're doing.

58:50.090 --> 58:52.760
So you don't put all that
strain on your system

58:52.760 --> 58:56.030
for no reason if you're not
losing the weight.

58:56.030 --> 58:58.300
- That work for you?
- [Larry] Yes.

58:58.300 --> 59:00.230
[Dr. Now] I hope so.

59:00.230 --> 59:02.370
Okay, Larry. If you need
anything, give me a call.

59:02.370 --> 59:03.470
All right.

59:03.470 --> 59:05.040
- [Dr. Now] I'll see you in three months.
- Thank you.

59:05.040 --> 59:06.570
- [Dr. Now] Bye.
- [Larry] Bye-bye.

59:12.180 --> 59:16.650
Larry still barely made any
changes to his eating habit.

59:16.650 --> 59:20.080
<i>If he hadn't had any
weight-loss surgery before,</i>

59:20.090 --> 59:23.590
<i>I would consider a number
of additional tools such as</i>

59:23.590 --> 59:26.060
<i>a nutritionist or psychotherapy.</i>

59:26.060 --> 59:30.130
But he was already provided
those in addition to surgery

59:30.130 --> 59:32.730
<i>and he ended up gaining
all the weight back.</i>

59:32.730 --> 59:34.300
<i>So the issue is simple.</i>

59:34.600 --> 59:38.070
<i>He never got to the point where
he was willing to give up the food</i>

59:38.070 --> 59:41.200
<i>and unless he does that
and shows me he can make</i>

59:41.210 --> 59:44.070
<i>a much bigger change
with his eating habit,</i>

59:44.080 --> 59:45.840
there is nowhere to go with him.

59:45.840 --> 59:49.280
So this is all still
completely up to him.

59:52.680 --> 59:57.090
<i>[Larry] I'm proud that I lost
over 40 pounds at this point.</i>

59:57.090 --> 1:00:01.690
<i>But I know that I really need to do better
and I'm going to, no matter what it takes,</i>

1:00:01.690 --> 1:00:04.560
<i>because that's the only option
that I have.</i>

1:00:04.560 --> 1:00:06.860
<i>I'm going to find
a place in Houston</i>

1:00:06.870 --> 1:00:11.070
<i>because my future is here,
getting Dr. Now's help.</i>

1:00:11.070 --> 1:00:15.070
<i>So whatever it takes to make
that happen, I'm ready to do it.</i>

1:00:27.590 --> 1:00:28.990
[woman] All right.
Here we are.

1:00:28.990 --> 1:00:30.590
[Larry] All righty.

1:00:31.690 --> 1:00:35.030
<i>Today, I'm looking for a place
to live in Houston</i>

1:00:35.030 --> 1:00:39.660
<i>'cause I know I need to move down
here regardless whatever happens.</i>

1:00:39.670 --> 1:00:42.400
<i>And I know I need a place
on the first floor</i>

1:00:42.400 --> 1:00:44.940
<i>'cause I'm not gonna
be climbing steps.</i>

1:00:44.940 --> 1:00:46.300
<i>At least, not yet.</i>

1:00:46.310 --> 1:00:48.210
Oh, that's a lot of steps.

1:00:48.210 --> 1:00:50.210
- [laughs]
- [woman] You think so?

1:00:51.140 --> 1:00:54.750
That's a lot of steps
in three flights.

1:00:54.750 --> 1:00:57.080
[woman] Well, um, your
apartment will be on the first floor.

1:00:57.080 --> 1:00:59.250
But unfortunately,
at the moment,

1:00:59.250 --> 1:01:02.350
I don't have anything on
the first floor to show you.

1:01:02.950 --> 1:01:05.760
But what I can gladly do is

1:01:05.760 --> 1:01:11.430
take a video of the apartment and,
you know, show you the video of it.

1:01:11.430 --> 1:01:15.030
That would be lovely,
but that's a lot.

1:01:15.030 --> 1:01:16.170
[woman] All right.

1:01:23.910 --> 1:01:25.580
All right. So here it is.

1:01:27.550 --> 1:01:31.310
Stainless steel appliances,
wood-style flooring.

1:01:38.120 --> 1:01:39.360
[woman] There it is.

1:01:45.230 --> 1:01:47.260
[footsteps approaching]

1:01:51.340 --> 1:01:52.400
All right.

1:01:52.840 --> 1:01:54.500
Oh, wow!

1:01:54.510 --> 1:01:58.110
So granite countertops,
stainless steel appliances,

1:01:58.110 --> 1:02:02.550
- um, wood-style flooring all throughout the apartment.
- [Larry] Very nice.

1:02:02.550 --> 1:02:03.880
Thank you.

1:02:03.880 --> 1:02:07.180
You're welcome, Larry. All
right. Any other questions?

1:02:07.190 --> 1:02:09.520
Um, no. That will be all.

1:02:09.520 --> 1:02:11.390
[exhales]

1:02:14.530 --> 1:02:19.030
<i>[Larry] I love the place, but the
limitations of my body are very real.</i>

1:02:21.070 --> 1:02:24.130
<i>And that's just showing me
how far I have still to go.</i>

1:02:24.870 --> 1:02:26.200
[woman] All right. We're here.

1:02:26.600 --> 1:02:28.070
[Larry] All right.

1:02:28.970 --> 1:02:30.040
[woman] You enjoy the tour,
Larry?

1:02:30.040 --> 1:02:32.280
- Absolutely.
- [woman] Everything good?

1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:34.810
- Thank you.
- [woman] You're welcome so much.

1:02:34.810 --> 1:02:36.250
Hopefully I will see you soon.

1:02:37.150 --> 1:02:38.280
[woman] All right. For sure.

1:02:38.280 --> 1:02:40.080
- Uh, I'll keep you posted on...
- [Larry] Please do.

1:02:40.090 --> 1:02:41.520
- everything else.
- [Larry] All right. Thank you.

1:02:41.520 --> 1:02:43.120
[woman] All right, Larry.

1:02:43.120 --> 1:02:45.220
And if you have any other
questions, feel free to call me.

1:02:45.220 --> 1:02:46.620
[Larry] I sure will.

1:02:46.630 --> 1:02:47.860
- May I sit here until the Uber comes, please?
- [woman] Of course.

1:02:47.860 --> 1:02:49.460
- [Larry] Thank you.
- [woman] No problem.

1:02:49.460 --> 1:02:50.990
-[Larry] All righty.
-[woman] All right, Larry. Nice meeting you.

1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.300
- [Larry] Nice meeting you, too.
- [woman] You take care.

1:02:53.300 --> 1:02:54.600
- [woman] Good luck with everything.
- [Larry] Thank you.

1:02:54.600 --> 1:02:56.670
[woman] You're welcome.

1:02:56.670 --> 1:02:59.640
<i>[Larry] I know it's gonna be a big step
for me to get this move under my belt.</i>

1:02:59.640 --> 1:03:01.910
<i>But if I'm not ready,
I'm not ready.</i>

1:03:01.910 --> 1:03:06.210
<i>And that means I'mma have to head
back to New York and keep working hard.</i>

1:03:06.210 --> 1:03:09.910
<i>'Cause I have a lot of work
to do to prove to Dr. Now</i>

1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:12.150
<i>that I'm ready for
another surgery.</i>

1:03:18.990 --> 1:03:19.920
[knocking at door]

1:03:19.930 --> 1:03:21.160
[Larry] Come in!

1:03:22.990 --> 1:03:25.130
- Hello!
- How you doing, Larry?

1:03:25.130 --> 1:03:27.000
I'm doing all right.
How are you?

1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:28.970
[Fred] I'm good.
Good to see you.

1:03:28.970 --> 1:03:30.170
Good to see you.

1:03:30.170 --> 1:03:31.600
[Fred] Yeah.

1:03:31.600 --> 1:03:32.900
[Fred] How's things going today?

1:03:32.910 --> 1:03:35.970
Pretty good.
I smell some chicken.

1:03:35.970 --> 1:03:38.910
No, no chicken today.
Got you a smoothie though.

1:03:38.910 --> 1:03:41.580
All right. Times have changed.

1:03:41.580 --> 1:03:42.710
[Fred] Yeah.

1:03:42.710 --> 1:03:44.680
<i>[Larry] I've been in New York
for a month.</i>

1:03:44.680 --> 1:03:48.850
<i>I'm hoping a first-floor apartment
in Houston becomes available soon.</i>

1:03:48.850 --> 1:03:51.490
<i>But until it does, I just have
to stay here and keep at it.</i>

1:03:53.020 --> 1:03:53.960
There you go.

1:03:53.960 --> 1:03:55.090
Oh, thank you.

1:03:55.090 --> 1:03:56.430
[Fred] You're welcome.

1:03:59.100 --> 1:04:00.700
And one for me, and one for you.

1:04:00.700 --> 1:04:03.100
[Larry] All right. I thought
you was gonna bring me

1:04:03.100 --> 1:04:05.740
some of that fried chicken
and macaroni and cheese.

1:04:05.740 --> 1:04:09.910
No, no. I know right now
you're trying to do better so...

1:04:09.910 --> 1:04:13.240
Yeah, that I am. I cleaned out
my refrigerator today.

1:04:13.250 --> 1:04:16.910
- Oh, okay.
- And cleaned out the freezer 'cause I'm

1:04:16.920 --> 1:04:19.620
getting prepared for
the new lifestyle.

1:04:19.620 --> 1:04:22.920
So how you feeling
about the transition?

1:04:22.920 --> 1:04:26.890
[Larry] A little anxiety but, you
know, that's comes with the territory.

1:04:26.890 --> 1:04:28.530
- It's to be expected.
- [Fred] Okay.

1:04:28.530 --> 1:04:30.330
But ready.

1:04:30.330 --> 1:04:33.830
What are some of the things you're
doing to help you cope with it right now?

1:04:33.830 --> 1:04:34.930
I pray.

1:04:34.930 --> 1:04:37.300
- Okay.
- I learned to talk about it.

1:04:37.300 --> 1:04:40.040
Not hold it in.
'Cause when you hold it in,

1:04:40.040 --> 1:04:41.570
that's when things get worse.

1:04:41.570 --> 1:04:45.140
- Okay. Okay.
- [Larry] I think that was part of my problem in the past.

1:04:45.140 --> 1:04:48.250
Holding it in and eating late
at night, and just...

1:04:48.250 --> 1:04:49.280
[Fred] Mm-hmm.

1:04:49.280 --> 1:04:50.650
not talking about it.

1:04:50.650 --> 1:04:52.320
And you gotta talk about it.

1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:55.150
- [Fred] Yeah.
- And talk openly and honestly about it.

1:04:55.150 --> 1:04:56.850
So what's your plans for today?

1:04:56.860 --> 1:04:59.590
I am going to
Albany Strength gym.

1:04:59.590 --> 1:05:00.960
Do a little bit of workout.

1:05:00.960 --> 1:05:02.560
Oh, okay. That's wonderful.

1:05:02.560 --> 1:05:05.830
[Larry] Yeah. Get a little bit
of workout in.

1:05:05.830 --> 1:05:10.670
<i>My whole life depends on getting a second
chance with another weight-loss surgery.</i>

1:05:10.670 --> 1:05:14.140
<i>So whatever it takes to make
that happen, I have to do it.</i>

1:05:14.140 --> 1:05:18.070
Speaking of the gym, whoo.
I better get ready.

1:05:18.080 --> 1:05:19.510
[Fred] Okay.

1:05:21.010 --> 1:05:23.150
And I will speak to you
later on, sir.

1:05:23.150 --> 1:05:24.950
- [Fred] Okay.
- All right.

1:05:24.950 --> 1:05:26.250
- Thank you.
- [Fred] Nice hanging out with you.

1:05:26.250 --> 1:05:27.820
Nice hanging out with you, too.

1:05:27.820 --> 1:05:29.590
Keep me posted
on your progress, okay?

1:05:29.590 --> 1:05:31.190
I sure will,
and thank you so much.

1:05:31.190 --> 1:05:32.260
[Fred] Well,
you're more than welcome.

1:05:32.260 --> 1:05:33.960
All righty. God bless you.

1:05:35.360 --> 1:05:36.930
And thank you for the smoothie.

1:05:36.930 --> 1:05:37.860
Oh, you're more than welcome.

1:05:37.860 --> 1:05:39.960
Next time will be
some fried chicken.

1:05:39.970 --> 1:05:42.730
No, maybe another smoothie.
But no more fried chicken.

1:05:42.730 --> 1:05:44.400
[chuckles]

1:05:45.570 --> 1:05:47.540
-[Larry] All right. You take care.
-[Fred] All right.

1:06:00.080 --> 1:06:01.520
- [Larry] Hello.
- [receptionist] Hi.

1:06:01.520 --> 1:06:03.120
[Larry] Hi. I'm Larry Myers.

1:06:03.120 --> 1:06:04.250
Are you checking in?

1:06:04.260 --> 1:06:06.020
- [Larry] Yes.
- Okay.

1:06:06.020 --> 1:06:07.460
So you can take a seat, okay?

1:06:07.460 --> 1:06:09.160
- [Larry] Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1:06:10.190 --> 1:06:13.060
<i>[Larry] Today, I'm at a local
clinic to get my weight checked.</i>

1:06:17.030 --> 1:06:18.600
Hi. Larry?
Do you wanna come with me?

1:06:18.600 --> 1:06:19.970
[Larry] Yes. Hi.

1:06:19.970 --> 1:06:21.040
How are you today?

1:06:21.040 --> 1:06:22.070
[Larry] I'm okay. Thank you.

1:06:22.070 --> 1:06:23.070
All right. Just come with me.

1:06:23.080 --> 1:06:24.140
[Larry] Sure.

1:06:24.140 --> 1:06:25.940
[woman] Come right in here.

1:06:26.980 --> 1:06:30.110
<i>[Larry] Dr. Now wanted me
to lose 120 pounds.</i>

1:06:35.020 --> 1:06:36.690
[woman] Good?

1:06:36.690 --> 1:06:38.620
- [woman] Okay. You ready?
- Yes.

1:06:38.620 --> 1:06:42.260
<i>[Larry] And at my
last weigh-in, I was 602.</i>

1:06:42.260 --> 1:06:45.360
<i>But if I did that, I will be
down to four-something today.</i>

1:06:48.470 --> 1:06:52.240
<i>And I really hope I made it because
I'm ready to move on with my life,</i>

1:06:52.240 --> 1:06:55.540
<i>move to Houston, and get the
weight-loss surgery that I need.</i>

1:06:58.580 --> 1:07:00.410
586.4.

1:07:03.880 --> 1:07:05.750
<i>[Larry] That's not enough</i>

1:07:05.750 --> 1:07:08.120
<i>and now I have to call Dr. Now
and tell him,</i>

1:07:08.120 --> 1:07:10.090
<i>and he's not gonna be happy.</i>

1:07:18.060 --> 1:07:19.160
[woman] Good?

1:07:22.430 --> 1:07:23.830
You okay? You got it?

1:07:23.840 --> 1:07:24.930
No.

1:07:24.940 --> 1:07:27.100
I got you. I got you.
All right.

1:07:27.110 --> 1:07:28.200
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1:07:28.770 --> 1:07:32.410
[Skype dial tone]

1:07:33.810 --> 1:07:35.480
<i>- [Dr. Now] Hello.
- Hey, Doctor.</i>

1:07:37.110 --> 1:07:38.210
<i>[Dr. Now] How are you?</i>

1:07:38.220 --> 1:07:39.950
I'm good. How are you?

1:07:39.950 --> 1:07:41.320
<i>I'm doing okay.</i>

1:07:41.320 --> 1:07:44.320
<i>So, Larry, what did you weigh
at today?</i>

1:07:44.320 --> 1:07:46.860
[Larry] I'm 586.

1:07:46.860 --> 1:07:48.160
<i>You're 586?</i>

1:07:48.160 --> 1:07:49.330
Yes, sir.

1:07:49.660 --> 1:07:52.830
<i>[Dr. Now] So in 3 months,
you only lost 16 pounds.</i>

1:07:52.830 --> 1:07:55.900
<i>So your weight loss
is slowing down</i>

1:07:55.900 --> 1:07:57.570
<i>and that's not good.</i>

1:07:57.570 --> 1:08:00.370
If you eat appropriately,

1:08:00.370 --> 1:08:04.940
<i>um, you should be able to lose
40 pounds in one month.</i>

1:08:04.940 --> 1:08:09.010
<i>I think you should be more
proactive to get your weight down.</i>

1:08:09.010 --> 1:08:10.250
And I am.

1:08:10.250 --> 1:08:12.850
<i>[Dr. Now] You think
you are but you're not.</i>

1:08:12.850 --> 1:08:14.720
<i>As the scale is showing.</i>

1:08:14.720 --> 1:08:17.920
<i>So the problem
is that, you know...</i>

1:08:17.920 --> 1:08:22.930
<i>You think you're eating less,
but actually you're still overeating.</i>

1:08:22.930 --> 1:08:26.960
<i>So, at this point, I'm not
sure what we can do for you.</i>

1:08:26.970 --> 1:08:32.070
<i>Unless you make the changes you need
and start eating less and lose more weight.</i>

1:08:32.070 --> 1:08:36.840
- Yes, sir.
<i>- At the bottom line, the goal is still the same.</i>

1:08:36.840 --> 1:08:42.210
<i>What I've been telling you to lose
breaks down to about 40 pounds a month.</i>

1:08:42.210 --> 1:08:45.420
So you want me to lose,
just to make sure I'm clear,

1:08:45.420 --> 1:08:47.320
you want me to lose
40 pounds in a month?

1:08:47.320 --> 1:08:49.650
<i>Yeah, I want you to lose
40 pounds a month.</i>

1:08:49.650 --> 1:08:51.790
<i>- Okay?
- Yes, sir.</i>

1:08:51.790 --> 1:08:54.820
<i>In the meantime, Larry, if you
need anything, give me a call.</i>

1:08:54.830 --> 1:08:58.090
- Okay. Bye-bye.
<i>- All right. Bye.</i>

1:09:07.570 --> 1:09:10.170
<i>[Larry] I can't let
myself give up.</i>

1:09:10.180 --> 1:09:15.110
<i>I just feel like I'm working harder
every time and the results are the same.</i>

1:09:15.750 --> 1:09:17.950
<i>So it's discouraging.</i>

1:09:19.880 --> 1:09:22.350
[man] Take your time. Step.

1:09:22.350 --> 1:09:25.420
<i>[Larry] But I know I need this
help and I'm not gonna give up.</i>

1:09:32.460 --> 1:09:34.000
[Larry panting]

1:09:45.610 --> 1:09:50.110
<i>[Larry] I decided to get some
motivational help by getting a trainer.</i>

1:09:50.120 --> 1:09:53.550
<i>I know I need to do better
with my diet and exercise.</i>

1:09:54.250 --> 1:09:55.990
<i>So I'm taking steps to do that.</i>

1:09:55.990 --> 1:09:59.260
<i>And I'm trying to take
the initiative to do better.</i>

1:09:59.260 --> 1:10:01.590
<i>And I feel like I worked
harder this past month</i>

1:10:01.590 --> 1:10:04.060
<i>than any other month before now.</i>

1:10:04.060 --> 1:10:08.830
<i>So I really hope I'm taking it all
up a notch, like I feel that I am.</i>

1:10:08.830 --> 1:10:11.800
Hello. I'm Larry. I have an
appointment with a trainer.

1:10:11.800 --> 1:10:13.970
- I think that's me.
- Oh, you're right on time.

1:10:13.970 --> 1:10:15.710
Yes, Larry. I'm Maja.
Nice to meet you.

1:10:15.710 --> 1:10:17.710
- Nice to meet you too.
- Wonderful.

1:10:17.710 --> 1:10:20.080
So if you're ready, we're gonna
head back and we're gonna get started.

1:10:20.080 --> 1:10:21.780
We'll chat a little bit, and
talk about why you're here.

1:10:21.780 --> 1:10:23.350
- All righty.
- All right.

1:10:26.150 --> 1:10:28.590
<i>[Larry] But the biggest step
I'm taking is making</i>

1:10:28.590 --> 1:10:31.920
<i>the arrangements
I need to move to Houston.</i>

1:10:31.920 --> 1:10:35.960
<i>The place I really like didn't
have an opening on the first floor.</i>

1:10:35.960 --> 1:10:37.830
<i>But I decided I've
waited long enough.</i>

1:10:37.830 --> 1:10:42.070
<i>I think the best thing for me to do is
change my environment and get to Houston.</i>

1:10:42.070 --> 1:10:44.200
<i>Not only to try and do better,</i>

1:10:44.200 --> 1:10:48.170
<i>but to show my commitment
by just making the move.</i>

1:10:48.170 --> 1:10:50.840
<i>And I think that's going
to help me to do better.</i>

1:10:50.840 --> 1:10:52.810
So, Larry, tell me
why you're here.

1:10:52.810 --> 1:10:55.210
What made you wanna
make a change?

1:10:55.210 --> 1:10:58.080
Well, I had lost a lot of weight
and then I put back on some.

1:10:58.080 --> 1:11:00.250
- Okay.
- [Larry panting]

1:11:00.250 --> 1:11:02.550
And it got... I fell
in the snow last year

1:11:02.550 --> 1:11:04.190
and it got hard for me to walk.

1:11:04.190 --> 1:11:05.220
Okay.

1:11:05.220 --> 1:11:06.920
Take a quick drink,
and then we'll start.

1:11:06.930 --> 1:11:08.190
I'm gonna have you stand up,

1:11:08.190 --> 1:11:10.090
- and we're gonna start with some arm circles.
- Okay.

1:11:10.100 --> 1:11:12.860
<i>[Larry] You know, a change in
environment will make a big difference.</i>

1:11:12.860 --> 1:11:14.830
<i>Like Dr. Now said.</i>

1:11:14.830 --> 1:11:18.070
<i>So I went online and found
another place that I could afford.</i>

1:11:18.070 --> 1:11:21.070
<i>And I committed
to a lease sight-unseen.</i>

1:11:21.070 --> 1:11:25.240
There you go. Another five, and
then we're gonna go backwards.

1:11:25.240 --> 1:11:27.080
And then one more, and
now let's take it backwards.

1:11:27.080 --> 1:11:29.250
There you go.

1:11:29.250 --> 1:11:32.420
And keep those palms forward so
that you get a nice stretch to your chest.

1:11:38.760 --> 1:11:41.560
Very nice. You've got
about five left.

1:11:41.560 --> 1:11:45.660
Three... Two... One.
Good. So now I want you to...

1:11:45.660 --> 1:11:47.830
We're gonna pull that walker
away a little bit. Look down.

1:11:47.830 --> 1:11:50.070
- You're body is gonna want to go down.
- [chuckles]

1:11:50.070 --> 1:11:54.770
Seven... Eight...
Nine... Ten. Good.

1:11:54.770 --> 1:11:56.510
Start counting your
steps too, you know.

1:11:56.510 --> 1:11:58.940
Start thinking about how many
it is before you get tired.

1:11:58.940 --> 1:12:02.110
And then, each time, we wanna
take a little further trip as well.

1:12:04.480 --> 1:12:06.180
[Larry panting]

1:12:09.150 --> 1:12:12.960
- Actually, this box might be blocking you a little bit.
- Yeah, that way's good.

1:12:12.960 --> 1:12:15.790
We don't need to go fast, we
just want to move consistently.

1:12:15.790 --> 1:12:17.490
Just like our progress here.

1:12:18.460 --> 1:12:20.000
Slow and consistent.

1:12:22.500 --> 1:12:26.000
<i>[Larry] If I could walk into
Dr. Now's clinic without the walker,</i>

1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:28.710
<i>that's my goal
for the next few months.</i>

1:12:28.710 --> 1:12:32.180
<i>And I'm gonna keep working
as hard as I can before then.</i>

1:12:32.180 --> 1:12:34.810
[Maja] You are here,
let's finish up the work.

1:12:34.810 --> 1:12:37.050
Don't let those little voices
in your head tell you

1:12:37.050 --> 1:12:39.020
that you can't do this,
you've got eight seconds left.

1:12:39.020 --> 1:12:40.720
Let's fight for eight more.

1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:42.990
You're fighting for your life,
let's fight for these last five.

1:12:42.990 --> 1:12:47.090
Four... Three... Two...
And one. There we go!

1:12:47.090 --> 1:12:49.160
- Thank you.
- Good work. You're welcome!

1:12:49.160 --> 1:12:52.130
See? That was a pleasure.
And I better see you in here again.

1:12:52.130 --> 1:12:53.800
-Absolutely.
-All right. Have a good day.

1:12:53.800 --> 1:12:55.000
You too, dear.

1:13:16.320 --> 1:13:20.060
Whoo-hoo! Houston time.
What a mess.

1:13:20.060 --> 1:13:22.590
Oh, boy. Gotta get it done.

1:13:24.230 --> 1:13:25.960
<i>Well, the day is finally here.</i>

1:13:25.960 --> 1:13:30.370
<i>I'm packing my whole apartment
up because I'm moving to Houston.</i>

1:13:31.770 --> 1:13:34.540
<i>I'm going to pack
everything up today,</i>

1:13:34.540 --> 1:13:37.840
<i>and then tomorrow
I'll be heading out.</i>

1:13:37.840 --> 1:13:42.250
<i>I'm saying goodbye to
Albany and hello to Houston.</i>

1:13:45.920 --> 1:13:51.690
<i>It seems like a lot of effort
and a long way to go,</i>

1:13:51.690 --> 1:13:57.330
<i>considering Dr. Now has not officially
approved me for weight-loss surgery yet.</i>

1:14:00.060 --> 1:14:03.530
<i>But I know in my heart that
this is the right thing to do</i>

1:14:03.540 --> 1:14:05.840
<i>because I don't have
another chance.</i>

1:14:05.840 --> 1:14:10.070
<i>And even though I'm making
progress, it's not as much as I hoped.</i>

1:14:10.070 --> 1:14:12.580
<i>So the big thing is
to lose more weight.</i>

1:14:12.580 --> 1:14:14.140
Texas!

1:14:32.860 --> 1:14:34.660
Well, hello, superstar!

1:14:34.670 --> 1:14:36.070
What's up, man?
How you feeling?

1:14:36.070 --> 1:14:38.200
I'm good, man.
Trying to get it together.

1:14:38.200 --> 1:14:39.600
That was a long trip.

1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:41.970
- It was a long flight.
- [laughing] You all right?

1:14:41.970 --> 1:14:43.870
It was... Hey, I made it.

1:14:43.880 --> 1:14:46.810
Well, I hope this ain't gonna scare
you. This ain't too much stuff, is it?

1:14:46.810 --> 1:14:47.910
Nah, it ain't too much.

1:14:47.910 --> 1:14:50.210
[Larry] I appreciate your help.

1:14:53.020 --> 1:14:57.750
<i>My friend Marvell came out all
the way from Chicago to Albany.</i>

1:14:57.760 --> 1:15:02.560
<i>So he can help me pack up
the van and drive me to Houston.</i>

1:15:02.560 --> 1:15:07.760
<i>Marvell is my online friend that
I've known for a few years now.</i>

1:15:07.770 --> 1:15:11.370
<i>It's a long drive, and I'm
not looking forward to it.</i>

1:15:11.940 --> 1:15:14.300
<i>But I'm choosing
the path of life.</i>

1:15:15.940 --> 1:15:19.140
<i>That's why I'm going
through all this trouble.</i>

1:15:19.140 --> 1:15:21.910
<i>To show up in Texas with
all my worldly belongings.</i>

1:15:21.910 --> 1:15:23.480
Can you take this cane, brother?

1:15:25.180 --> 1:15:28.020
<i>And show Dr. Now
that I'm a loser of weight.</i>

1:15:28.690 --> 1:15:30.320
Oh, this is perfect.

1:15:32.020 --> 1:15:36.460
<i>And that I can be trusted to
take a surgery to the next level.</i>

1:15:51.580 --> 1:15:54.480
<i>[Larry] Here it is.
I sure hope I like this place.</i>

1:15:56.010 --> 1:15:57.480
<i>I think anything
will make me happy.</i>

1:15:59.980 --> 1:16:02.080
You can just pull in
right there.

1:16:02.090 --> 1:16:04.020
Just enough room
for me to get out.

1:16:06.090 --> 1:16:07.090
That's perfect.

1:16:24.270 --> 1:16:25.340
[grunts]

1:16:33.020 --> 1:16:34.380
[labored breathing]

1:16:36.990 --> 1:16:38.590
- You can go ahead.
- Yeah.

1:16:39.860 --> 1:16:43.290
-You okay? You...
-I can open it. Go ahead.

1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:58.170
<i>[Larry] This trip was actually not
too bad despite the complications.</i>

1:16:58.180 --> 1:17:03.050
<i>My first driver, he had to go back home
'cause he'd had a death in his family.</i>

1:17:03.050 --> 1:17:05.580
<i>But he was nice enough
to get somebody else.</i>

1:17:05.580 --> 1:17:06.650
<i>He's actually a truck driver.</i>

1:17:06.650 --> 1:17:08.280
<i>He got me here nice and safe</i>

1:17:08.750 --> 1:17:13.120
<i>'cause we ran into some severe snow
that was hitting the car and everything.</i>

1:17:13.120 --> 1:17:16.090
<i>But I made it here safely.</i>

1:17:16.090 --> 1:17:21.160
<i>Today, after everything else, it
rained and I got completely soaked.</i>

1:17:21.170 --> 1:17:26.140
<i>But all that's behind me now,
and I'm gonna try to be positive.</i>

1:17:26.140 --> 1:17:28.470
<i>And then, I got
really no time to rest</i>

1:17:28.470 --> 1:17:31.910
<i>because my cousin is coming
to take me to Dr. Now's.</i>

1:17:31.910 --> 1:17:35.880
<i>And I'm going to get weighed,
so we'll see if I was a good boy</i>

1:17:35.880 --> 1:17:37.980
<i>with the diet,
on the road or not.</i>

1:17:39.880 --> 1:17:41.220
Ohhh.

1:17:45.290 --> 1:17:47.090
This is nice.

1:18:07.140 --> 1:18:12.150
Okay. I can get
in there. Nice.

1:18:12.150 --> 1:18:15.350
<i>I feel pretty good
about the apartment at least.</i>

1:18:15.350 --> 1:18:19.760
<i>I'm just ready to relax,
but I know I can't yet.</i>

1:18:19.760 --> 1:18:22.830
<i>I gotta go see Dr. Now.</i>

1:18:22.830 --> 1:18:25.030
<i>And I still got a lot
of work ahead of me</i>

1:18:25.030 --> 1:18:29.130
<i>if I'm gonna find myself
living the life I want to live.</i>

1:18:39.110 --> 1:18:41.340
[breathing heavily]

1:18:43.450 --> 1:18:46.680
Thank you for bringing the microwave
in, even though I ain't got no food.

1:18:46.680 --> 1:18:48.120
[both laugh]

1:18:48.120 --> 1:18:50.850
My doctor said, "The less
you eat, the better it is."

1:18:50.860 --> 1:18:52.790
But I don't think he meant
a refrigerator like that.

1:18:52.790 --> 1:18:54.290
[both laugh]

1:18:54.290 --> 1:18:57.160
But it's all good. You gotta
laugh about certain things.

1:18:58.060 --> 1:18:58.890
[Donnell chuckling]

1:18:58.960 --> 1:19:00.430
Okay.

1:19:11.210 --> 1:19:14.810
<i>[Larry] I'm at Dr. Now's to
find out where my weight is at.</i>

1:19:14.810 --> 1:19:19.420
<i>Dr. Now wanted me to lose
120 pounds in 3 months.</i>

1:19:19.420 --> 1:19:23.150
<i>So if I did that, I will
be down to 466 today.</i>

1:19:25.660 --> 1:19:28.020
Your weight is 529.

1:19:29.990 --> 1:19:32.660
<i>[Larry] All right.
57 pounds. That's not bad.</i>

1:19:32.660 --> 1:19:35.800
- We're gonna be going to Room 5.
- Okay.

1:19:35.800 --> 1:19:40.600
<i>[Larry] But I also know that is not as
much as the doctor would like to see.</i>

1:19:40.610 --> 1:19:43.440
<i>In fact, it's not close
to what he would wanna see.</i>

1:19:44.710 --> 1:19:48.240
<i>It's still nowhere near
the goal that Dr. Now gave me.</i>

1:19:49.580 --> 1:19:52.250
<i>So I don't know how
to feel about it all.</i>

1:19:52.250 --> 1:19:54.950
<i>I knew I'd been working
really, really hard</i>

1:19:54.950 --> 1:19:57.120
<i>but it's like it's not working.</i>

1:19:58.890 --> 1:19:59.990
[knock on door]

1:20:03.030 --> 1:20:05.090
Hello. Hi, Larry.
How you doing?

1:20:05.100 --> 1:20:06.700
I'm doing okay.
How are you, sir?

1:20:06.700 --> 1:20:08.260
I'm doing well.

1:20:08.270 --> 1:20:11.000
So how are you getting along
then? How was your trip down then?

1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:14.900
Long, but I made it.
Settled into the apartment...

1:20:14.910 --> 1:20:16.740
- Okay.
- and I'm down here.

1:20:16.740 --> 1:20:18.140
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

1:20:18.140 --> 1:20:21.040
Well, Larry, I'm happy
to see that you improved.

1:20:21.050 --> 1:20:23.950
But it's still not losing
as much as you should.

1:20:23.950 --> 1:20:27.550
So far, you've lost
119 pounds in one year.

1:20:27.550 --> 1:20:30.590
Which is what you should
have lost in the first three months.

1:20:30.590 --> 1:20:34.020
And still after one year,
you're still using the walker.

1:20:34.260 --> 1:20:36.590
- Right.
- So you shouldn't be,

1:20:36.590 --> 1:20:38.760
right now, at this point,
using the walker.

1:20:38.760 --> 1:20:42.570
You should have improved
that you can walk independently.

1:20:42.570 --> 1:20:44.930
When I don't use
the walker it makes me

1:20:44.940 --> 1:20:46.900
feel a little wobbly,
but I'll do better.

1:20:46.900 --> 1:20:51.210
That's good, but, Larry, I
see your hard work recently,

1:20:51.210 --> 1:20:55.710
and I'm proud of you for losing
weight consistently in the last year.

1:20:55.710 --> 1:20:58.150
You haven't given up and
that's starting to pay off.

1:20:58.150 --> 1:21:00.680
So here's what I'm going to do.

1:21:00.690 --> 1:21:04.590
If you are able to lose 55
pounds over the next three months,

1:21:04.590 --> 1:21:06.920
then I'm going to approve you
for weight-loss surgery.

1:21:06.920 --> 1:21:09.390
- That sound fair for you?
- That made me smile.

1:21:09.390 --> 1:21:11.660
Yes, that sounds
very fair to me.

1:21:11.660 --> 1:21:14.100
And I'm going to do that

1:21:14.100 --> 1:21:17.370
'cause I have the complex I
moved in, I can walk around it.

1:21:17.370 --> 1:21:19.540
And I know you want
me to get rid of this, so...

1:21:19.700 --> 1:21:21.240
I will do that.

1:21:21.240 --> 1:21:26.780
Great. So you have next goal, and
you also need to improve your mobility

1:21:26.780 --> 1:21:30.580
and be able to walk
independently without this walker.

1:21:30.580 --> 1:21:34.050
That'd have to go on for
giving you okay before surgery.

1:21:34.050 --> 1:21:36.050
But I need to see
improvement there too.

1:21:36.050 --> 1:21:40.590
And so your stamina also needs
to improve. So work on that too.

1:21:40.590 --> 1:21:43.860
- Yes.
- So, at this point, you have your work to do

1:21:43.860 --> 1:21:46.100
for next three months,
and to prove to me

1:21:46.100 --> 1:21:47.960
that you can be qualified
for weight-loss surgery.

1:21:47.970 --> 1:21:49.130
- Okay?
- Okay.

1:21:49.130 --> 1:21:50.370
You think you can do that?

1:21:50.370 --> 1:21:52.870
I know I can. Absolutely.

1:21:52.870 --> 1:21:55.800
So, you're not gonna
let us down, will you?

1:21:55.810 --> 1:21:58.570
No, I've come too far and
I've moved down here for good.

1:21:58.580 --> 1:22:00.880
So, I'm going to do it.

1:22:00.880 --> 1:22:04.450
Great. Because if you don't, we're
not moving ahead with the surgery.

1:22:04.450 --> 1:22:08.680
-So don't relax and slip up. You got it.
-I understand.

1:22:08.690 --> 1:22:12.960
All right. We'll take care of you, and
if you need anything, give me a call.

1:22:12.960 --> 1:22:15.960
- Will do.
- And we'll see how we do in three months. Okay?

1:22:15.960 --> 1:22:16.690
Gotcha.

1:22:16.690 --> 1:22:18.130
- All right, Larry.
- All right.

1:22:18.130 --> 1:22:21.260
- Nice to see you again, and good luck.
- Good to see you. Thank you.

1:22:29.570 --> 1:22:33.480
Up until recently, Larry
hasn't made much progress.

1:22:33.480 --> 1:22:37.010
<i>But I'm very happy to see the
improvement he's making now.</i>

1:22:37.010 --> 1:22:40.920
<i>It shows me he's trying to
get hold of his eating habits,</i>

1:22:40.920 --> 1:22:45.090
<i>and taking control, like he has
needed to do for a long time.</i>

1:22:45.090 --> 1:22:48.060
He's still not making
the progress he should.

1:22:48.060 --> 1:22:52.390
<i>But since he has at least
continued to lose over the past year,</i>

1:22:52.400 --> 1:22:56.100
<i>and he's improving now,
if he can at least show me</i>

1:22:56.100 --> 1:22:58.970
<i>that he can stick with this
level of current progress</i>

1:22:58.970 --> 1:23:01.900
<i>over the next few months,
then I will approve him</i>

1:23:01.910 --> 1:23:03.640
for another weight-loss surgery.

1:23:03.640 --> 1:23:05.640
<i>And we will move ahead with him.</i>

1:23:05.640 --> 1:23:11.650
<i>But even if we take that step with him, we
have a long road ahead to get Larry to a place</i>

1:23:11.650 --> 1:23:16.990
<i>where he's not only healthy, but he's
able to stick with it for the long term.</i>

1:23:16.990 --> 1:23:22.190
But he has at least taken the first step
to show me he's willing to try to change.

1:23:22.190 --> 1:23:25.260
<i>So I'm happy about that,
and I'm hoping</i>

1:23:25.260 --> 1:23:28.930
<i>we will able to move
ahead with him very soon.</i>

1:23:30.300 --> 1:23:32.170
- All right. How are you?
- Good.

1:23:32.170 --> 1:23:35.370
[panting] Ready
to rock and roll.

1:23:36.270 --> 1:23:38.670
<i>[Larry] He wants me
to lose more weight.</i>

1:23:38.680 --> 1:23:41.410
<i>Am I disappointed? In a way.</i>

1:23:41.410 --> 1:23:43.810
<i>I'm a little sad,
but at the same token,</i>

1:23:43.810 --> 1:23:46.520
<i>you take the good with the bad
and just work even harder.</i>

1:23:47.820 --> 1:23:49.280
<i>And that's what I'm gonna do.</i>

1:23:49.950 --> 1:23:51.950
- [driver] Inside?
- Yes, sir.

1:23:52.720 --> 1:23:54.590
<i>[Larry] I was
a little disappointed</i>

1:23:54.590 --> 1:23:57.930
<i>that he told me that I wasn't
having surgery right now, but...</i>

1:23:57.930 --> 1:24:01.260
<i>I know that I will
eventually, so it's fine.</i>

1:24:23.150 --> 1:24:26.090
<i>[Larry] I've been going
on walks twice a day.</i>

1:24:30.030 --> 1:24:32.800
<i>My stamina has
already gone up a lot.</i>

1:24:32.800 --> 1:24:35.430
<i>And that makes me really happy.</i>

1:24:36.670 --> 1:24:39.970
<i>When I came here, I
was unsure if I could do it.</i>

1:24:39.970 --> 1:24:44.140
<i>But now I know that I can,
and I'm fully committed.</i>

1:24:47.680 --> 1:24:51.180
<i>There's a lot left to do,
but I'm ready to do it.</i>

1:24:51.180 --> 1:24:54.580
<i>I want next year to start with
my weight-loss surgery approval,</i>

1:24:54.590 --> 1:24:57.150
<i>and end with getting
to my target weight.</i>

1:24:57.150 --> 1:25:00.160
<i>That's my goal, and that's
what I promise to do.</i>

1:25:10.200 --> 1:25:12.200
<i>So I'm going to do it.</i>

1:25:12.200 --> 1:25:14.800
<i>And I've already
made it this far.</i>

1:25:14.810 --> 1:25:17.210
<i>Even though I know
it's gonna be really hard,</i>

1:25:17.970 --> 1:25:19.210
<i>I'm going to do this.</i>
