01:48.900 --> 01:49.980
Good to see you also.

02:20.261 --> 02:24.833
Ah, Louisa, beautiful Louisa.

02:27.941 --> 02:32.164
Although many of our families
were locked up in internment camps...

02:32.230 --> 02:36.353
weJapanese-Americans fought valiantly
for our country in World War Two.

02:37.702 --> 02:41.411
We forged a special bond of friendship
with our white officers...

02:41.478 --> 02:44.445
realizing that all of us
believed in the ideals...

02:44.518 --> 02:46.974
that forged our country.

02:47.047 --> 02:49.315
In battles in Italy and France...

02:50.183 --> 02:54.973
we became one of the most decorated
army units in World War Two.

02:56.007 --> 03:00.033
Today, the President
of the United States honors us...

03:00.103 --> 03:02.307
with a special unit citation.

03:02.983 --> 03:05.601
The citation will be accepted
on our behalf...

03:05.670 --> 03:10.592
by Sergeant Ketsuke Miyagi
and Mrs. Louisa Pierce...

03:10.664 --> 03:12.802
the widow of LieutenantJack Pierce.

03:13.671 --> 03:18.374
These men were legendary soldiers
in a regiment of heroes.

03:18.440 --> 03:21.255
Attention!

03:23.367 --> 03:25.986
Guard! Colors.

03:26.056 --> 03:29.122
Attention!

03:55.721 --> 03:58.624
- More potatoes, Mr. Miyagi?
- No, thank you, Louisa-san.

03:58.698 --> 04:00.998
Miyagi is rice man, remember?

04:06.313 --> 04:09.793
I am so sorry that my granddaughter's
not here to meet you.

04:09.865 --> 04:12.004
I don't know where she can be.

04:13.993 --> 04:18.019
Julie! This is Mr. Miyagi.
He was a friend of your grandfather.

04:22.282 --> 04:23.656
Hi.

04:24.843 --> 04:28.455
Please excuse me for a moment.

04:31.625 --> 04:34.823
Julie, I want you to come out
and meet Mr. Miyagi.

04:34.891 --> 04:37.957
- I did. I said "Hi."
- I want you to talk to him.

04:38.027 --> 04:39.554
You invited him here.
You talk to him.

04:39.627 --> 04:41.536
- What are you doing?
- Getting some meat.

04:41.611 --> 04:43.466
- Why?
- It's for a friend.

04:43.531 --> 04:45.768
May I ask which friend?

04:45.835 --> 04:49.829
Why is it, whenever I come back here,
I feel like I'm in a police station.

04:49.900 --> 04:51.624
I'm surprised you don't take
my fingerprints.

04:51.692 --> 04:55.336
I worry about you, that's all.
You've got to tell me what you want.

04:55.404 --> 04:58.088
What I want is for you
to leave me alone!

04:58.156 --> 05:00.326
Where are you going?
Susan!

05:03.276 --> 05:06.537
My name is Julie.
My mother's name was Susan.

05:06.604 --> 05:09.833
She was killed in a car accident
with my father, and they're both dead.

05:09.900 --> 05:12.005
So stop trying to bring them back.

05:17.004 --> 05:21.893
I'm sorry you had to see that.
She is always so very angry.

05:21.965 --> 05:24.168
Anybody who lose parent...

05:25.836 --> 05:28.486
have much grief.

05:28.556 --> 05:32.485
Grief trapped in the heart
become big anger.

05:33.516 --> 05:35.404
I don't know what to do anymore.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.324
Have suggestion.

05:45.645 --> 05:49.573
Suggest Louisa-san...

05:49.645 --> 05:51.850
water flowers.

05:53.518 --> 05:55.658
What do you mean, flowers?

05:55.727 --> 05:58.092
Not here flower.

05:58.158 --> 06:01.867
Flower in Miyagi garden.
California.

06:53.297 --> 06:55.152
Hi, Angel.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.390
Hi.

07:01.487 --> 07:03.692
How you doing, huh?

07:03.760 --> 07:08.494
How's your wing?
Does it feel any better?

07:09.553 --> 07:12.848
Come here. Can you come to me?
Come here, hop to my hand.

07:13.872 --> 07:17.222
Good girl.
Let's go for a walk, okay?

07:17.297 --> 07:18.825
Come on.

07:21.201 --> 07:24.366
I got in another argument
with my grandmother tonight.

07:25.392 --> 07:27.727
I wish my parents were still here.

07:29.745 --> 07:32.233
Everything wouldn't be
so messed up.

07:35.474 --> 07:37.034
You know...

07:38.065 --> 07:41.927
if they found out you were here,
they'd take you away.

07:42.002 --> 07:46.126
Wouldn't that be awful?
In some small cage.

07:46.195 --> 07:48.202
You wouldn't know anybody.

07:55.570 --> 07:58.919
- 544, handle code two.
- We're checking it out.

08:00.339 --> 08:03.820
Larry, look at that,
up on the roof.

08:07.667 --> 08:10.220
If she hasn't jumped yet,
I'm gonna throw her.

08:10.291 --> 08:12.625
I'll be back.
You be quiet, okay?

08:12.691 --> 08:14.218
You be quiet.

08:20.372 --> 08:23.089
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

08:29.107 --> 08:32.174
- You think she's still up here?
- Beats me.

08:33.043 --> 08:35.378
- What was that?
- Look out!

08:36.883 --> 08:39.217
You! Hold it right there!

08:39.284 --> 08:41.618
I said hold it!
Police!

08:58.485 --> 09:00.754
Stop!

09:00.821 --> 09:02.676
Oh, come on!

09:17.046 --> 09:19.283
Look, I've heard all this before.

09:19.350 --> 09:22.862
Why don't you put it on a video so I can
fast-forward through the familiar parts?

09:22.933 --> 09:27.124
I love you, Julie,
and I know you love me.

09:27.190 --> 09:30.932
But these days,
we act as if we hate each other.

09:30.998 --> 09:35.221
Talking doesn't seem to help.
It just makes things worse.

09:35.287 --> 09:39.477
Mr. Miyagi's invited me to spend
some time at his house in California.

09:39.542 --> 09:42.608
He'll stay here and take care of
everything while I'm gone.

09:52.215 --> 09:57.365
This zone is for the immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.024
No parking.

09:59.095 --> 10:02.510
Please do not leave
any baggage unattended.

10:06.167 --> 10:09.483
- Skycap! Here.
- Yes, sir?

10:11.224 --> 10:13.296
I've tried sometimes...

10:13.368 --> 10:16.183
Just to talk to you
and not get angry...

10:16.249 --> 10:18.670
but everything gets messed up,
and I don't know why.

10:20.025 --> 10:21.430
Things get messed up for me too.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.583
Bye.

10:32.665 --> 10:35.796
Grandmother barely on plane...

10:35.865 --> 10:37.720
miss you already.

10:39.545 --> 10:42.196
My birthday's in a couple of weeks.
I guess she forgot.

10:43.225 --> 10:45.135
Birthday.

10:45.210 --> 10:49.519
Very special day.
Everybody have birthday.

10:49.592 --> 10:53.870
Miyagi make you
special dinner, okay?

10:53.945 --> 10:58.223
Tempura. Tempura, sukiyaki.
You like?

10:59.258 --> 11:01.113
No like. Okay.

11:01.178 --> 11:04.342
Sushi.
Sushi, sashimi. Huh?

11:04.410 --> 11:06.712
Sashimi. No. Okay.

11:06.778 --> 11:12.376
Miyagi have it.
Hamburger teriyaki with French fry.

11:13.563 --> 11:17.818
Look, I don't need a special dinner.
I can take care of myself.

11:19.802 --> 11:22.136
- I know where I'm going.
- Good.

11:22.202 --> 11:26.458
Miyagi know where you're going too.
Going school.

11:32.699 --> 11:35.514
Miyagi pick you up here this afternoon.
Okay, Julie-san?

12:19.741 --> 12:22.075
Hey, get to class.
Get going.

12:24.349 --> 12:27.513
Get to class.
Let's go.

12:39.838 --> 12:43.897
Morning, Julie. No, no, no.
Those are bad for your ears.

12:43.966 --> 12:45.308
Go to hell, Ned.

12:46.014 --> 12:48.348
Now, I could take you down
to the principal's office...

12:48.413 --> 12:50.355
and get you into a little trouble.

12:50.430 --> 12:54.391
Or, I could pick you up tomorrow night
and take you down to the docks.

12:54.462 --> 12:58.139
You've been to the docks, haven't you,
Julie? Pretty girl like you.

12:58.206 --> 12:59.898
Dream on.

12:59.967 --> 13:05.270
Hey! Most girls in this school
invite me.

13:05.343 --> 13:07.994
Now, you're lucky
to get an invitation.

13:08.064 --> 13:10.878
Now, come on, Julie.
You know it's going to happen.

13:10.943 --> 13:12.471
Let go of me!

13:12.544 --> 13:14.965
Start hanging out
with me and my friends...

13:15.039 --> 13:18.038
you can have any damn thing
that you want.

13:18.111 --> 13:20.184
- Let go of me.
- What's going on, Ned?

13:20.255 --> 13:22.458
Colonel Dugan, sir.

13:22.527 --> 13:24.632
I caught this young lady
smoking cigarettes.

13:24.703 --> 13:26.775
What are you talking about?
I wasn't smoking.

13:26.847 --> 13:30.557
Her name is Julie Pierce, sir.

13:32.128 --> 13:34.648
To the office. Let's go.

13:34.720 --> 13:36.575
Curb your dog.

13:37.857 --> 13:42.424
A member of the Alpha Elite caught
this student smoking in the greenhouse.

13:42.496 --> 13:45.016
Put her record
in the center file.

13:45.088 --> 13:49.245
If this student screws up again,
I want her out of here.

13:49.312 --> 13:52.957
Of course, it depends
on which rule she breaks.

13:54.849 --> 13:58.111
No second chances.
Next time, that's it.

14:01.281 --> 14:03.998
- I agree.
- All right, young lady...

14:04.065 --> 14:05.920
you've been warned.

14:06.945 --> 14:09.466
Now get to your next class.

14:09.538 --> 14:12.091
It's a big school.
I might get lost on the way.

14:12.162 --> 14:16.318
McGowen, take this student
to her next class. Room 238.

14:22.018 --> 14:24.352
Hey, I'm Eric.
What's your name?

14:24.417 --> 14:26.490
Go to hell.

14:26.561 --> 14:30.174
"Go to hell." That's a funny name.
Is it Chinese?

14:30.243 --> 14:34.105
Don't strain yourself. You're just
another jerk working for Colonel Dugan.

14:34.179 --> 14:36.993
So, you got a problem with that?

14:37.059 --> 14:39.393
Hang out with morons,
and you catch their stupidity.

14:39.459 --> 14:42.874
The Alpha Elite-
it's like a championship football team.

14:42.946 --> 14:44.157
That's what this school's known for.

14:44.226 --> 14:47.968
Right.
And you believe everything you hear?

14:49.026 --> 14:51.001
I don't believe your name is
"Go to hell."

14:52.515 --> 14:54.369
See you later.

15:14.083 --> 15:15.938
- McGowen, right?
- Yeah.

15:16.003 --> 15:19.386
Colonel Dugan told me you took
Julie Pierce to her next class.

15:19.459 --> 15:21.981
- Any problems?
- No.

15:22.053 --> 15:23.907
No? Good.

15:24.612 --> 15:26.619
Don't forget, she's mine.

15:41.062 --> 15:43.068
Anybody home?

15:59.846 --> 16:02.334
It's okay. It's okay.

16:05.350 --> 16:09.344
How's the wing, huh?
Does it feel any better?

16:11.333 --> 16:13.188
Don't worry.

16:15.398 --> 16:18.246
- What are you doing up here?
- Where'd you get the hawk?

16:18.310 --> 16:21.725
She got shot in the wing.
I found her on the grass near the gym.

16:21.798 --> 16:23.358
- Does it bite?
- Yeah.

16:23.430 --> 16:25.798
Yeah, so stay back.

16:30.472 --> 16:32.359
So, what is this place?

16:32.423 --> 16:35.390
One of the janitors
used to keep pigeons up here.

16:35.463 --> 16:39.774
Yeah? It's pretty cool.
You got your own private little zoo.

16:39.846 --> 16:43.076
- This is my secret, all right?
- Well, not anymore.

16:45.415 --> 16:49.889
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean? What do I mean?

16:49.960 --> 16:51.901
You tell anybody about this,
and you're gonna be in trouble.

16:51.975 --> 16:55.587
- What kind of trouble?
- Well, I'll-

16:55.655 --> 16:57.511
- I'll call Domino's Pizza.
- Yeah?

16:57.576 --> 16:59.965
I'll have them deliver 48 pizzas
in the middle of the night.

17:00.041 --> 17:02.943
That's great. I love pizza.
No anchovies, okay?

17:03.016 --> 17:05.351
I'll write your name
all over the girls' bathroom.

17:07.432 --> 17:10.115
I'll tell everyone you have
some weird social disease.

17:10.185 --> 17:12.519
I guess I'm gonna be
pretty popular then, huh?

17:13.736 --> 17:15.589
- You have a car?
- Yeah.

17:15.656 --> 17:18.078
How would you like a pound of sugar
poured down the gas tank?

17:18.153 --> 17:20.487
- You're kinda angry, aren't you?
- Yes!

17:20.553 --> 17:24.165
- I like that.
- What are you gonna do about Angel?

17:26.890 --> 17:28.482
So, what are you gonna do?

17:28.553 --> 17:29.797
You'll see.

17:32.714 --> 17:36.129
In the past,
we've had external enemies.

17:36.202 --> 17:40.162
Now the enemy is in our country.

17:40.233 --> 17:44.511
It's inside our cities,
in our schools.

17:44.586 --> 17:48.710
In a war, you have to be
ready and able to destroy your enemy.

17:48.778 --> 17:52.127
Your school is clean and orderly...

17:52.202 --> 17:56.359
because you are ready and able
to give a maximum response.

17:56.427 --> 17:59.972
Some punk brings spray paint,
puts graffiti on our walls...

18:00.042 --> 18:03.077
we spray paint his eyeballs
so that he sees red.

18:03.148 --> 18:06.115
Some kid drops a candy wrapper...

18:06.187 --> 18:08.291
you make him pick it up and eat it.

18:08.362 --> 18:11.013
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir!

18:11.083 --> 18:15.142
Are you ready and able to give
a maximum response?

18:15.211 --> 18:17.600
A maximum effort?
To go to the limit?

18:19.274 --> 18:20.704
All right.

18:20.779 --> 18:25.188
Now, this is a bullring,
and I am the bull.

18:25.260 --> 18:28.042
My objective is to defend.

18:28.108 --> 18:31.457
Your objective is to attack...

18:31.532 --> 18:33.093
so take your best shot.

18:33.165 --> 18:35.368
Does that mean anything goes,
Colonel Dugan?

18:35.436 --> 18:37.672
Try whatever you'd like.

18:50.669 --> 18:51.715
I got him. Hit him.

19:02.702 --> 19:04.327
- Very good, Ned.
- Sir!

19:07.181 --> 19:08.391
Where is McGowen?

19:10.637 --> 19:11.978
McGowen, get out here.

19:16.109 --> 19:17.320
You have a problem?

19:19.022 --> 19:22.371
No, I don't. I'll fight for my family,
I'll fight for myself...

19:22.446 --> 19:24.999
but I'm not gonna step in there just
so you can show me how tough you are.

19:25.070 --> 19:28.201
Maybe you should fight
out of anger then.

19:31.950 --> 19:34.700
Yes!
Now that's more like it.

19:35.885 --> 19:37.577
That's what I like to see.

19:38.702 --> 19:40.360
Get back.

19:43.567 --> 19:46.316
I guess that made you feel
like a man, huh?

19:46.382 --> 19:48.454
Did you feel pretty good?

19:49.999 --> 19:52.682
When the enemy is weakest,
that's when you destroy them.

19:52.750 --> 19:54.890
Excuse me.

19:54.960 --> 19:58.255
Looking for student
named Julie Pierce.

19:58.319 --> 20:00.359
Who the hell are you?

20:02.480 --> 20:05.992
My name Miyagi.
Friend of student grandmother.

20:07.951 --> 20:10.440
I don't care if you're a friend
of the pope.

20:10.512 --> 20:12.366
You're trespassing.

20:12.431 --> 20:15.182
Now get your butt off school property.

20:17.616 --> 20:20.430
- Boy, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

20:21.968 --> 20:25.645
What are you all gawking at?
Let's do some laps. Come on!

20:35.121 --> 20:37.292
I told you to leave.

20:37.361 --> 20:40.011
Do you have a problem
with your hearing?

20:40.080 --> 20:41.674
No, hearing okay.

20:41.745 --> 20:44.941
Then it must a problem with this
old body of yours getting rickety.

20:45.009 --> 20:49.679
- You don't move very fast.
- Move fast enough when necessary.

20:49.745 --> 20:51.371
I told you to leave.

20:51.442 --> 20:56.176
Miyagi raised in small village...

20:56.241 --> 20:58.860
on Okinawa.

20:58.930 --> 21:00.817
At that time...

21:00.882 --> 21:03.118
was a very bad-tempered bull...

21:03.185 --> 21:05.574
live in a pasture near village.

21:05.650 --> 21:08.519
Bull very bad. He chase children...

21:08.593 --> 21:11.693
woman going shopping,
farmer, everybody.

21:11.763 --> 21:15.986
Then, one day, big festival.

21:16.051 --> 21:17.993
Everybody happy.

21:24.883 --> 21:26.377
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

21:29.908 --> 21:34.162
That day,
bad bull become good soup.

21:42.036 --> 21:44.938
- Did you tell Dugan about the hawk?
- You stayed after school to ask me that?

21:45.011 --> 21:47.565
If anyone finds out about Angel,
they're gonna take her away.

21:47.636 --> 21:48.912
Is that what you call her- Angel?

21:48.979 --> 21:52.362
- How do you know she's a girl?
- Will you just answer the question?

21:52.436 --> 21:54.094
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

21:54.164 --> 21:58.573
Well, I'm not getting out of this car
until you tell me what you're gonna do.

21:58.645 --> 22:00.433
Fine. Have it your way.

22:03.220 --> 22:05.129
Do you like my car?

22:05.204 --> 22:08.946
It's an Oldsmobile 442.
I saved it from the junkyard.

22:09.972 --> 22:13.584
- It's just a car.
- "It's just a car"?

22:13.652 --> 22:16.174
Does MichaelJordan
Just play basketball?

22:16.246 --> 22:18.100
Is Wayne Gretzky
Just a hockey player?

22:18.165 --> 22:19.627
I don't know. Is he?

22:19.701 --> 22:23.313
No, he's not.
He's great, like this car.

22:28.853 --> 22:31.024
- Where are you going?
- To work.

22:33.588 --> 22:37.418
- You're a train driver?
- Security.

22:37.493 --> 22:41.487
- A security guard?
- Yeah, that's right.

22:41.558 --> 22:44.874
You know, my grandfather, he used
to be an engineer in this train yard.

22:44.949 --> 22:48.245
I just chase the rats.
Come here, I wanna show you something.

22:54.166 --> 22:56.500
From up here you could see
the top of the world.

22:56.567 --> 22:58.422
Come on up.

23:11.639 --> 23:13.493
Why do you do this?

23:15.351 --> 23:17.839
Well, for the money.
What else?

23:19.192 --> 23:22.705
My dad walked out on us
about six years ago.

23:22.776 --> 23:25.776
For a while he was sending us money,
but then he just stopped.

23:25.848 --> 23:27.856
So, I had to get a job.

23:29.559 --> 23:33.683
I don't know, I guess he didn't think
we were very important.

23:37.015 --> 23:40.365
It doesn't matter though.
This is temporary.

23:40.440 --> 23:44.183
I'm going to the Air Force Academy.
I'm gonna be a fighter pilot.

23:44.249 --> 23:46.158
Dugan said I can get in.

23:46.233 --> 23:48.818
That's why you joined his group?

23:48.888 --> 23:50.896
Yeah.

23:50.969 --> 23:53.358
Yep, it's a pain in the ass...

23:53.432 --> 23:56.051
but, hey, it'll get me
in the cockpit of an F-15.

23:57.081 --> 23:59.950
I never think about the future.

24:00.025 --> 24:04.466
Sure you do.
What are you doing next month?

24:04.537 --> 24:06.992
Don't know.

24:07.065 --> 24:09.879
- What are you doing next week?
- Don't care.

24:09.945 --> 24:13.174
What are you doing
in the next five seconds?

24:13.241 --> 24:15.129
I'm gonna make you promise me...

24:15.193 --> 24:17.844
that you won't tell anybody
about the hawk.

24:17.914 --> 24:20.249
- Don't worry.
- Promise.

24:22.074 --> 24:24.409
- Look, if it's that important to you-
- Promise!

24:26.778 --> 24:28.304
All right.

24:29.209 --> 24:30.736
I promise.

24:35.546 --> 24:38.842
Talk to you again soon.
Bye-bye.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.318
Julie-san, hello.

24:48.187 --> 24:49.910
So, how was school today?

24:49.979 --> 24:52.794
What's wrong with you?
Are you crazy?

24:52.860 --> 24:56.437
You're supposed to knock
before you come into a girl's room!

24:56.507 --> 24:58.928
Very, very sorry.
Miyagi apologize.

24:59.002 --> 25:00.825
Very sorry. Oh, very sorry.

25:06.651 --> 25:08.310
Okay, I'm dressed.
You can look now.

25:11.772 --> 25:14.739
Miyagi apologize.
You see...

25:14.812 --> 25:18.587
before, live with friend, Daniel-san.

25:18.653 --> 25:21.620
Daniel-san come Miyagi room,
Miyagi go Daniel-san room.

25:21.692 --> 25:25.652
No big thing.
A boy is easier.

25:25.724 --> 25:28.539
- Just forget about it, okay?
- Okay.

25:28.605 --> 25:33.112
Today, Miyagi go pick up Julie-san
at the school...

25:33.181 --> 25:35.668
but you not there.

25:35.740 --> 25:37.780
I went to the train yard
to talk to this guy.

25:37.853 --> 25:40.854
- No big deal.
- Miyagi also talk to people-

25:40.926 --> 25:42.616
your teachers.

25:42.685 --> 25:45.500
Bring home homework you miss
for three weeks.

25:45.565 --> 25:48.599
Great.
Maybe I'll do it sometime.

25:49.565 --> 25:51.421
Maybe do it tonight.

25:52.670 --> 25:54.524
Don't order me around.

25:54.589 --> 25:57.905
Is not order.
Is very small request.

25:57.981 --> 26:00.698
I told you this morning,
I know where I'm going in my life...

26:00.766 --> 26:02.870
and I don't need any math problems
to get there.

26:06.686 --> 26:09.174
Ambition without the knowledge...

26:09.246 --> 26:12.956
is like boat on dry land.

26:15.070 --> 26:16.794
Forget it, I'm outta here!

26:25.565 --> 26:28.665
Will you just stay out of my life?
Stop telling me what to do!

26:28.735 --> 26:31.769
Not trying to tell you nothing.
Try teach you something.

26:31.839 --> 26:34.838
Teach me? Look at you!
You can't even speak English.

26:46.431 --> 26:48.821
- Wow, I'm really sorry. Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

26:48.897 --> 26:51.711
Are you okay?
I'm really sorry.

26:51.777 --> 26:53.880
She came out of nowhere, man.
I didn't even see her.

26:53.950 --> 26:55.674
- You're not hurt?
- I said I was okay!

26:55.743 --> 26:58.591
Hey, look, I'm really sorry!
Listen, man, I'm really sorry.

26:58.655 --> 27:02.070
I just gotta deliver this pizza down
the road. My boss has been on my case.

27:02.143 --> 27:05.308
And I've been having trouble
with my- I gotta go! I'm sorry!

27:05.376 --> 27:09.631
Are you sure you're okay?
I gotta go! I'm really sorry!

27:15.425 --> 27:18.207
Go ahead.
Do what my grandmother does.

27:18.273 --> 27:20.640
Tell me I made another mistake.

27:20.705 --> 27:24.021
"Julie, you're so thoughtless.
Julie, you lost your temper again."

27:25.696 --> 27:28.544
Julie-san, Miyagi no need say nothing.

27:28.609 --> 27:31.326
You're doing very nice job,
thank you.

27:31.392 --> 27:33.335
You're not gonna say anything?

27:34.401 --> 27:37.881
Have small question.
Where you learn that?

27:37.953 --> 27:39.296
Learn what?

27:39.362 --> 27:42.907
Jump into tiger position
when car almost hit you.

27:42.977 --> 27:45.247
They no teach that kind of stuff
girl's gym.

27:46.146 --> 27:48.121
I don't know what you're talking about.

27:48.194 --> 27:50.528
I just reacted.

28:13.443 --> 28:16.739
My father taught me karate
when I was a little girl.

28:18.435 --> 28:21.184
We used to do it every night
after school.

28:21.251 --> 28:23.553
I thought it was a game.

28:23.619 --> 28:26.586
Your grandpapa...

28:26.659 --> 28:29.507
save Miyagi life...

28:29.572 --> 28:31.426
long time ago.

28:32.868 --> 28:34.722
Was wartime.

28:36.068 --> 28:40.706
So, Miyagi try to say thank you...

28:40.772 --> 28:42.779
teach him karate.

28:43.812 --> 28:45.667
He love karate.

28:47.492 --> 28:49.948
He teach your father.

28:50.020 --> 28:52.354
Your father teach you.

28:54.148 --> 28:56.516
And then they died.

28:56.581 --> 28:58.915
Everybody died.

29:00.837 --> 29:03.291
Miyagi understand.

29:03.364 --> 29:05.853
Miyagi also have parents
at one time.

29:08.198 --> 29:11.165
Anger no bring them back.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.146
My mother was a beautiful woman.

29:18.213 --> 29:21.955
Whenever I watched her get dressed
for a party...

29:22.022 --> 29:24.771
I thought she looked
like a magical princess.

29:24.837 --> 29:27.226
My father loved her.

29:27.302 --> 29:31.557
He was wise and funny and kind.

29:35.462 --> 29:37.797
It wasn't right
that they were killed.

29:38.630 --> 29:39.840
It wasn't fair.

29:42.247 --> 29:45.029
Death not fair to anyone...

29:45.095 --> 29:50.560
but still
we must live our lives.

29:50.630 --> 29:53.947
I used to see them
so bright in my mind...

29:54.023 --> 29:55.878
so clear.

29:56.935 --> 29:59.269
Now all I have
are these photographs.

30:01.575 --> 30:04.706
Julie-san, parents leave you...

30:04.776 --> 30:07.328
more than just the photographs.

30:07.399 --> 30:10.368
Leave you
with very valuable legacy.

30:11.656 --> 30:14.525
- What legacy?
- Karate.

30:16.361 --> 30:17.986
What's so special about that?

30:19.911 --> 30:22.246
Karate here.

30:24.040 --> 30:28.961
But, this time,
you too young to understand...

30:29.032 --> 30:31.203
true value of karate.

30:32.264 --> 30:36.039
For once, I wish you could give me
an answer I could understand.

30:38.889 --> 30:41.508
Answer only important...

30:41.578 --> 30:43.432
when ask right question.

30:45.706 --> 30:48.519
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

31:12.395 --> 31:15.264
How come my makeup's
all over the bathroom?

31:15.338 --> 31:17.192
Too much makeup.

31:17.257 --> 31:18.948
What?

31:19.018 --> 31:21.834
Bathroom have too much makeup.

31:21.899 --> 31:23.808
What do you mean,
"too much makeup"?

31:23.882 --> 31:26.697
There's no such thing
as too much makeup.

31:26.762 --> 31:29.446
Julie-san,
it become problem when-

31:29.515 --> 31:31.784
The problem is my teeth.

31:31.851 --> 31:34.437
I just realized.
They don't match my nose.

31:36.363 --> 31:39.559
Teeth fine, nose fine.

31:39.627 --> 31:42.116
Everything fit just fine.

31:44.299 --> 31:48.161
I've been thinking about
this karate stuff my dad taught me.

31:48.235 --> 31:50.275
Do you think I could still do it?
I'm not real strong.

31:50.348 --> 31:52.388
Many kind of strength, Julie-san.

31:52.459 --> 31:55.776
Well, I thought maybe
you could give me a few lessons...

31:55.852 --> 31:59.878
so if Dugan's guys try to hassle me,
I could take care of myself.

31:59.948 --> 32:03.429
You want a lesson?
You pay Miyagi.

32:03.500 --> 32:05.988
Pay you? With what? I'm broke.

32:08.268 --> 32:12.742
Miyagi take four homework paper
payment one karate lesson.

32:12.813 --> 32:15.681
- No way.
- No way, no teach.

32:15.756 --> 32:17.283
All right.

32:18.541 --> 32:20.962
Two math papers for one lesson.

32:21.036 --> 32:23.971
Two math paper, one history paper.

32:25.517 --> 32:27.372
Okay. Deal.

32:28.461 --> 32:30.316
Let's start right now.

32:30.381 --> 32:33.513
Good.
First, we wax the car.

32:33.582 --> 32:37.357
This hand wax on,
this hand wax off. See?

32:37.422 --> 32:40.204
Forget it.
I'm not waxing anybody's car.

32:40.270 --> 32:43.782
But first we wax car,
then we work engine.

32:43.853 --> 32:47.149
This new kind karate.
Very much fun.

32:47.213 --> 32:49.123
Fun? The mall is fun.

32:49.198 --> 32:51.718
You have money for gasoline go mall?

32:51.790 --> 32:54.180
I told you, I'm broke.

32:54.254 --> 32:56.163
Then no need go mall.

32:56.238 --> 33:00.013
You know what? I don't think
you know anything about girls.

33:02.062 --> 33:05.674
Miyagi have much to learn
about girls.

33:08.783 --> 33:10.638
Boys easier.

33:24.334 --> 33:26.856
I still want to go to the mall.

33:26.928 --> 33:31.205
But I thought maybe
you could loan me some money.

33:31.280 --> 33:33.419
No need loan money.

33:33.488 --> 33:36.651
Family across street have
three young boys need baby-sitter.

33:36.720 --> 33:40.015
Miyagi told them
you'd be very happy take job.

33:48.335 --> 33:49.677
Hi, I'm Julie.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.048
Yes!

34:00.657 --> 34:04.105
- What are you doing here?
- Miyagi figure...

34:04.177 --> 34:07.919
children no have enough toys,
so bring more.

34:07.985 --> 34:11.946
Nerf balls, flying disk.

34:12.016 --> 34:14.406
All kind good stuff.
You just have fun.

34:14.481 --> 34:17.797
"Have fun"? Mr. Miyagi,
they don't need any more toys.

34:17.873 --> 34:20.175
They need three
child-sized straightjackets.

34:20.880 --> 34:24.143
Sun is warm, grass is green.

34:24.208 --> 34:25.353
What?

34:25.425 --> 34:29.255
If today Julie-san get angry...

34:29.330 --> 34:31.630
Just you repeat those words.

34:31.697 --> 34:34.830
Take deep breath in
through nose.

34:34.899 --> 34:37.036
Sun is warm, grass is green.

34:37.106 --> 34:38.764
Everything work out.

34:45.810 --> 34:49.585
The sun is warm,
the grass is green.

34:52.690 --> 34:55.342
Get her! Get her!
Come on!

35:03.604 --> 35:05.808
Come on! Come on!

35:07.220 --> 35:09.074
- Move! Go!
- Got ya!

35:10.291 --> 35:12.145
Let's get outta here!

35:26.549 --> 35:29.778
You planned that whole thing.

35:29.845 --> 35:34.580
Baby-sitting sometime good exercise
for karate student, Julie-san.

35:34.645 --> 35:38.420
Well, when do I learn how to break
boards and stuff like that?

35:40.307 --> 35:45.327
Why break boards?
What boards do to you?

35:45.397 --> 35:50.132
That kind stuff no teach you
how to conquer anger, Julie-san.

35:50.197 --> 35:52.531
- Understand?
- Yeah.

36:33.207 --> 36:37.462
Julie Pierce- I knew it.
Cops said it was a girl. Let's go.

36:49.272 --> 36:53.462
Julie, what's going on?
Looking for an education?

36:53.527 --> 36:55.699
- Surprise.
- Where you going, Julie?

36:57.496 --> 37:00.595
- Maybe she left something in her locker.
- Let go of me!

37:04.664 --> 37:06.998
She's feisty, feisty.

37:12.792 --> 37:13.839
Get her!

37:26.553 --> 37:28.343
There's no way out, Julie!

37:32.346 --> 37:34.353
I know you're in here, Julie.

37:39.290 --> 37:42.104
Come on, Julie.
I'm not that bad.

37:46.329 --> 37:48.915
Let's just talk.

37:48.986 --> 37:51.321
Let's try to be friends, Julie.

37:57.178 --> 38:00.049
I hope I didn't scare you, Julie.

38:00.123 --> 38:01.977
I didn't mean to.

38:05.498 --> 38:08.313
I just want to see if we can
work out some of our differences.

38:13.178 --> 38:16.626
I really don't like McGowen.

38:19.579 --> 38:22.197
I thought maybe we can...

38:22.267 --> 38:24.122
talk about that a little bit.

38:53.917 --> 38:55.772
You should have let me take you to-

38:57.532 --> 39:00.697
You're real pretty in the moonlight,
but this is nice.

39:00.764 --> 39:01.975
Get off!.

39:02.045 --> 39:06.616
Sometimes I like it different.
Where you going, Julie?

39:10.749 --> 39:12.757
Get her, will you?

39:24.925 --> 39:26.781
Come on, guys, move it!

39:29.182 --> 39:31.834
Don't let her
out of this courtyard!

39:31.903 --> 39:34.236
- Here we come, Julie!
- Get her!

39:35.966 --> 39:38.300
Don't let her go!
Open the door!

39:40.734 --> 39:44.509
I'll see you at the docks.
Don't forget, we have a date.

39:56.351 --> 39:59.002
Officer, I'm so glad you're here.

40:06.046 --> 40:10.389
So what you doing at school
this hour, Julie-san-studying?

40:12.063 --> 40:14.398
I was trying to feed Angel.

40:14.464 --> 40:19.069
Angel.
Rather you act like angel.

40:19.136 --> 40:20.991
Angel's a hawk, Mr. Miyagi.

40:21.792 --> 40:24.214
- Hawk?
- Yes.

40:24.288 --> 40:26.393
It's a long story.

40:26.464 --> 40:29.333
Miyagi ready to listen
to long story.

40:29.408 --> 40:31.263
Get in car, please.

40:36.993 --> 40:39.000
You're mad at me, aren't you?

40:42.624 --> 40:47.807
Julie-san, try to protect hawk
is okay, good.

40:47.873 --> 40:50.360
But should have told Miyagi.

40:53.825 --> 40:57.622
Dugan talked with the principal. They
kicked me out of school for two weeks.

40:58.658 --> 41:00.567
Now I'll never catch up
with my classes.

41:00.642 --> 41:03.937
Maybe I should just
forget about school...

41:04.001 --> 41:06.751
forget about my life.

41:06.818 --> 41:10.167
Why can't I just lock myself in my room
and listen to music all day?

41:10.242 --> 41:12.664
No, please.

41:12.738 --> 41:14.745
Too hard on Miyagi ear.

41:15.778 --> 41:18.014
Have better idea.

41:18.082 --> 41:20.505
Tomorrow we go special place.

41:21.602 --> 41:25.464
Go visit longtime Miyagi friend.

41:27.683 --> 41:30.399
- Hi, Eric.
- What are you doing here?

41:30.465 --> 41:33.761
Something happened at school,
and I got suspended for a little while.

41:33.826 --> 41:38.267
We're going out of town for a couple
weeks. Can you feed the hawk for me?

41:38.339 --> 41:39.997
What'd you get suspended for?

41:40.067 --> 41:44.158
It's a long story. I'll tell you later.
Can you feed the hawk?

41:44.227 --> 41:45.656
Yeah, no problem.

41:45.730 --> 41:49.310
Good. It's raw meat every other day
and keep the water bottle filled.

41:49.380 --> 41:51.681
Well, I'm gonna miss you.

41:51.747 --> 41:53.341
You gonna miss me?

41:56.133 --> 41:57.180
Maybe.

41:57.252 --> 42:00.797
Maybe? I'm not accepting
any maybes today.

42:00.868 --> 42:02.078
Eric, watch out.

42:02.147 --> 42:04.035
I want an answer.
You gonna miss me?

42:04.100 --> 42:07.199
- Not if you break your leg.
- That's not the answer I want.

42:08.868 --> 42:10.176
I want an answer.

42:11.716 --> 42:14.171
- Yes.
- What?

42:15.364 --> 42:17.121
Yes, I'll miss you.

42:17.828 --> 42:19.203
Bye.

42:46.469 --> 42:52.100
Julie-san, you get five gallon
unleaded regular...

42:52.167 --> 42:55.549
and some chocolate bar with almonds.

42:55.622 --> 42:56.997
Right.

43:02.885 --> 43:04.741
- Hi.
- How are you?

43:04.806 --> 43:08.548
Can I get five gallons of gas and some
chocolate bars with almonds, please?

43:18.502 --> 43:21.220
- Ted, what are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.

43:34.759 --> 43:37.182
Hello, dog.

43:37.256 --> 43:40.038
Nice puppy.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.527
Very nice dog.

43:46.600 --> 43:49.219
How'd you do that, Mr. Miyagi?
That dog was about to attack me.

43:49.289 --> 43:53.031
- Anything possible if not afraid.
- I wish I had your courage.

43:53.097 --> 43:55.464
- Wish I had chocolate bar with almond.
- I got 'em.

43:55.528 --> 43:59.457
What the hell you think you're doing?
Look at my dog.

44:01.256 --> 44:03.842
You turned him into a damn chicken.

44:03.913 --> 44:06.946
Sometime animal have more sense
than human.

44:07.016 --> 44:09.319
Yeah?
Well, you watch your mouth, old man.

44:09.385 --> 44:13.663
- Come on, let's just get outta here.
- You ain't going till I say so.

44:13.737 --> 44:16.071
Hey, let girl go.

44:17.386 --> 44:21.380
- Watch it, Ted.
- What are you gonna do, old man? Fight?

44:21.451 --> 44:23.272
Fighting not good.

44:44.587 --> 44:47.653
Fighting not good.
Somebody always get hurt.

44:47.723 --> 44:50.025
Right. I totally agree.

44:51.467 --> 44:53.323
That was great, Mr. Miyagi.

44:55.082 --> 44:57.450
No, not great.

44:57.515 --> 45:00.330
Miyagi always look for way
not to fight.

45:00.395 --> 45:04.421
Miyagi hate fighting.
Was most unfortunate.

45:04.491 --> 45:08.168
"Unfortunate"? Come on. Aren't you glad
you kicked some guy's butt?

45:09.708 --> 45:12.578
Not want to kick anything.

45:12.651 --> 45:16.907
Was most unfortunate their butts
attached to small brain.

45:30.508 --> 45:32.363
Now what?

45:33.837 --> 45:35.363
Now we wait.

46:32.719 --> 46:34.574
Sorry. Sorry.

46:45.648 --> 46:48.648
There's this loud bong going off,
and I couldn't sleep any longer.

46:50.416 --> 46:55.401
So I thought we'd get
some breakfast.

46:56.655 --> 46:58.827
Earth to Miyagi.

47:00.112 --> 47:02.796
Come in, Mr. Miyagi.

47:13.008 --> 47:15.015
Good morning, Julie-san.

47:18.577 --> 47:22.319
Rock garden is very sacred place.

47:22.385 --> 47:24.719
Is example of inner peace.

47:25.969 --> 47:28.620
Sand represent ocean.

47:28.689 --> 47:30.697
Big rock, Japan.

47:31.408 --> 47:33.384
Small rock, Okinawa...

47:33.458 --> 47:36.873
- where Miyagi born.
- So?

47:36.946 --> 47:38.954
So, go visitJapan.

47:39.026 --> 47:41.960
- What?
- Hurry up. Get on big rock.

47:46.035 --> 47:48.009
All right, I'm on Japan.

47:48.082 --> 47:49.936
Think I could buy a TV set
while I'm here?

47:50.001 --> 47:52.489
No, no, no. No TV set.

47:53.521 --> 47:57.231
First, you fake front kick
at opponent.

47:57.298 --> 48:02.514
Roll hip, come around, make round kick,
land on Okinawa.

48:02.578 --> 48:05.066
- That sounds hard.
- Try.

48:17.364 --> 48:18.770
That's impossible.

48:18.835 --> 48:23.472
Anything try first time impossible,
but must try. Do again.

48:23.538 --> 48:25.994
Is there a trick to this-
something I haven't figured out?

48:26.067 --> 48:29.001
- Pray.
- Pray?

48:30.484 --> 48:33.779
Great. Wonderful.
That's a big help.

48:47.923 --> 48:50.095
Very good, Julie-san.
Try again.

48:53.364 --> 48:55.730
When little girl growing up...

48:55.796 --> 48:58.666
parents always say,
` Be good...

48:58.741 --> 49:01.970
wear pretty dress, no fight. `

49:02.037 --> 49:04.623
Then, when same girl grow up...

49:04.693 --> 49:08.883
when in time in dangerous situation,
she hesitate.

49:08.949 --> 49:13.008
Oh? So when is it okay?
I mean, how do you know when to f-

49:13.077 --> 49:17.452
When you have full respect for self...

49:17.525 --> 49:20.656
respect for others,
that answer come.

49:24.693 --> 49:27.955
What are we supposed to do here?
Pitch some hay?

49:29.110 --> 49:31.630
Julie-san must learn be alert.

49:31.701 --> 49:35.412
Must know all times
where is trouble.

49:37.046 --> 49:40.178
- All right, I'm alert.
- Open eyes.

49:40.246 --> 49:43.443
My eyes are already open.
What am I supposed to do?

49:49.206 --> 49:50.963
Focus, Julie-san.

49:54.390 --> 49:56.845
Boy, am I hungry.
I could eat a big juicy-

50:56.953 --> 50:58.480
What?

51:01.082 --> 51:02.129
What?

51:09.114 --> 51:11.766
What's the problem?

51:11.835 --> 51:13.688
What'd I do wrong?

51:15.258 --> 51:18.389
Julie-san try to kill cockroach.

51:18.458 --> 51:22.615
What? Like you've never tried
to kill a cockroach before?

51:22.682 --> 51:25.584
Monks here believe...

51:25.658 --> 51:29.433
negative action cause
suffering and pain.

51:31.291 --> 51:36.561
So, therefore,
within monastery walls...

51:36.635 --> 51:39.091
nothing is ever killed.

51:39.164 --> 51:41.018
Well, that's a stupid rule.

51:48.250 --> 51:50.106
Where you going?

51:55.484 --> 51:59.226
Is stupid when neighborhood gangs...

51:59.292 --> 52:01.233
kill each other with no reason.

52:05.116 --> 52:09.688
Is stupid when countries fight wars.

52:11.453 --> 52:15.708
Not stupid to respect
all living things.

52:16.827 --> 52:19.479
Yeah, I bet you've killed a cockroach.

52:21.340 --> 52:24.602
Miyagi don't live in monastery,
Julie-san...

52:24.668 --> 52:28.924
but still respect all living things.

52:36.158 --> 52:38.100
Attention!

52:38.974 --> 52:40.981
By the time I'd left the army...

52:41.054 --> 52:43.803
I had learned one thing:

52:43.869 --> 52:47.218
When you go into battle,
you must be strong.

52:47.293 --> 52:48.721
Eric McGowen?

52:48.797 --> 52:51.482
- Yeah.
- Eyes forward.

52:51.550 --> 52:52.923
Your mother's on the phone.

52:54.269 --> 52:57.717
You're not finished here.
You don't leave here until I say so.

53:01.822 --> 53:04.311
You leave here, and you can forget
about that recommendation...

53:04.383 --> 53:06.488
to the Air Force Academy.

53:06.559 --> 53:10.835
That'll be it for you. You'll end up
flipping burgers the rest of your life.

53:15.967 --> 53:19.796
- Mom, what's wrong?
- Eric, it's me, Julie.

53:19.871 --> 53:22.140
Julie. What's going on?

53:22.207 --> 53:25.753
Sorry I had to call you at school,
but the place I'm at has no phone.

53:25.823 --> 53:27.482
I wanted to make sure Angel's okay.

53:28.544 --> 53:31.860
She's lonely.
I think she misses you.

53:31.936 --> 53:34.653
I hope this phony call
doesn't get you in trouble.

53:34.720 --> 53:38.998
- So when are you coming back?
- I don't know.

53:39.072 --> 53:40.926
Well, you better make it soon, okay?

53:42.975 --> 53:44.568
See ya.

55:52.422 --> 55:56.546
I'm sorry I tried to kill
the cockroach. Look.

56:12.134 --> 56:14.523
Good.

56:21.958 --> 56:26.049
This time I'm not
gonna get taken by surprise.

56:26.118 --> 56:28.421
That very good to hear, Julie-san.

56:28.487 --> 56:32.262
You're in here.
I know you are.

56:33.862 --> 56:37.026
- Feel alert, Julie-san?
- Totally.

56:37.095 --> 56:40.674
- Ready to defend self?
- No problem.

56:40.743 --> 56:42.269
Good.

56:43.462 --> 56:45.219
Then do with blindfold.

56:45.287 --> 56:48.833
Come on. How can I block an attack
if I can't see?

56:51.815 --> 56:57.446
Then you use ear, nose, skin, feet.

56:57.512 --> 57:00.992
Learn to use all senses.

57:12.104 --> 57:15.104
I did it! I was focused!
Totally focused!

57:20.649 --> 57:24.424
Must open senses wider, Julie-san.

58:24.171 --> 58:26.789
I'm really sorry.
I thought you guys were asleep.

58:26.859 --> 58:29.194
I'm outta here.
I'll get outta here right away.

58:36.075 --> 58:39.654
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mr. Miyagi.

58:42.827 --> 58:44.683
What's going on?

58:46.732 --> 58:48.904
Nothing.

58:48.973 --> 58:51.339
Just monks having good time.

58:54.124 --> 58:56.580
I thought they were supposed to be
spiritual leaders.

58:56.653 --> 59:01.388
Never trust spiritual leader
who cannot dance.

59:27.246 --> 59:31.555
Mr. Miyagi, I can't do this.
I've tried a thousand times.

59:31.629 --> 59:35.174
You remember what I say
first time we do this?

59:35.245 --> 59:36.391
Pray?

59:36.462 --> 59:41.547
Praying mantis always
drop to one knee before strike.

01:00:01.103 --> 01:00:04.037
Yes! Yes!

01:00:07.791 --> 01:00:10.693
I did it! I did it! Yes!

01:00:16.303 --> 01:00:18.376
Congratulations, Julie-san.

01:00:18.447 --> 01:00:22.246
"Congratulations"? That's all
you're gonna say, is congratulations?

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:25.255
- Don't I get a belt or something?
- Buy belt mall.

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.674
I mean a karate belt-
brown belt, black belt.

01:00:29.744 --> 01:00:32.842
- Why need belt?
- So everyone knows I'm good.

01:00:32.911 --> 01:00:36.457
You know you good.
That the important thing.

01:00:36.528 --> 01:00:39.725
Come on.
Even Elvis Presley got a black belt.

01:00:39.792 --> 01:00:42.313
Borrow from Elvis
next time see him.

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:47.877
Wax on, wax off.

01:00:48.913 --> 01:00:50.474
Very good, Julie-san.

01:00:53.649 --> 01:00:55.023
Miss spot.

01:01:15.954 --> 01:01:18.093
This called footwork kata.

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:28.653
Footwork, footwork, footwork!
That's it!

01:01:32.914 --> 01:01:34.322
One more time! Whoa! Boom!

01:01:51.699 --> 01:01:53.904
Tomorrow we go home.

01:01:53.972 --> 01:01:55.826
Time go back school.

01:01:55.891 --> 01:01:58.444
Yeah, I know.

01:01:59.443 --> 01:02:02.793
I wish the monks had had dinner with us.
I would have liked to say "good-bye."

01:02:10.644 --> 01:02:13.678
Monks discover something
about Julie-san.

01:02:17.172 --> 01:02:20.020
Think they like tell you something.
Come.

01:02:21.141 --> 01:02:24.720
Okay, I confess. I killed a spider
in my bedroom, but it was an accident.

01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:26.960
I even buried him
and said a little prayer.

01:02:32.885 --> 01:02:37.195
Happy birthday to you

01:02:41.333 --> 01:02:45.774
Happy birthday, dear Julie-san

01:02:45.846 --> 01:02:50.451
- Happy birthday to you
- This is great.

01:02:50.518 --> 01:02:53.388
It's the first cake
I'm ever gonna eat with chopsticks.

01:02:54.454 --> 01:02:56.078
Blow candle, make wish.

01:02:56.149 --> 01:02:58.289
Maybe you get it.

01:03:06.134 --> 01:03:08.589
Monks agree...

01:03:08.662 --> 01:03:13.267
to give Julie-san one wish
and one gift.

01:03:14.327 --> 01:03:18.069
Well, my one wish was that you guys
would come visit us in Boston.

01:03:19.735 --> 01:03:21.459
This is difficult.

01:03:21.527 --> 01:03:25.650
We have not left monastery
for many years.

01:03:32.151 --> 01:03:34.159
Wish granted.

01:03:34.231 --> 01:03:38.225
Now receive gift.

01:03:45.752 --> 01:03:49.364
Your gift is demonstration
of Zen archery.

01:03:49.432 --> 01:03:52.629
So, where's the target?

01:03:54.712 --> 01:03:56.567
You're looking at it.

01:03:57.432 --> 01:03:59.189
Excuse me?

01:04:00.216 --> 01:04:02.453
Abbot will shoot one arrow-

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.789
not for points.

01:04:04.856 --> 01:04:07.824
If master small thing...

01:04:07.897 --> 01:04:10.385
anything become possible.

01:04:11.512 --> 01:04:14.230
Miyagi volunteer for this honor.

01:05:12.347 --> 01:05:13.874
Thanks for the arrow.

01:05:32.059 --> 01:05:33.521
Hi, Julie!

01:05:35.324 --> 01:05:37.146
Good morning, Julie.
Welcome back.

01:05:37.212 --> 01:05:40.595
Good morning, Mr. Wilkes.
Listen, I'm sorry about what happened.

01:05:40.669 --> 01:05:42.392
Well, I guess
you learned something.

01:05:42.461 --> 01:05:45.395
Ambition without knowledge is like
a boat on dry land.

01:05:45.469 --> 01:05:47.772
I don't quite understand
your answer.

01:05:47.838 --> 01:05:50.935
The answer's only important
if you ask the right question.

01:05:55.389 --> 01:05:57.298
- Hi, Eric.
- How you doing?

01:05:57.373 --> 01:05:58.747
Great. How are you?

01:05:58.813 --> 01:06:01.148
Just fine. Welcome back.

01:06:01.213 --> 01:06:02.588
Thanks.

01:06:03.454 --> 01:06:07.032
So, tell me-
where did you go?

01:06:08.221 --> 01:06:10.709
I can't tell you.

01:06:10.782 --> 01:06:13.848
- What do you mean, you can't tell me?
- You'd never believe me.

01:06:13.918 --> 01:06:15.894
Hey, I haven't been up
to see Angel yet. How is she?

01:06:15.967 --> 01:06:17.592
- She's fine. She's doing good.
- Is she?

01:06:17.663 --> 01:06:19.005
- Yeah. We're best friends.
- Really?

01:06:19.071 --> 01:06:20.892
- You want some milk?
- Thanks.

01:06:22.525 --> 01:06:24.380
Look who's back in school.

01:06:26.814 --> 01:06:29.148
Looks like Ned and his friends
are still mad at me.

01:06:30.270 --> 01:06:32.506
Yeah, well, you're not the only one
they're mad at.

01:06:33.886 --> 01:06:36.537
- I quit Dugan's group.
- You what?

01:06:38.079 --> 01:06:39.935
Come on.
I'll tell you about it.

01:06:42.239 --> 01:06:46.101
So, tell me about the Air Force Academy.
I thought Dugan could get you in.

01:06:46.175 --> 01:06:48.312
I don't need Dugan.
I can do it on my own.

01:06:48.383 --> 01:06:52.311
He's been giving people orders for
so long, he's got their brains fried.

01:06:52.382 --> 01:06:54.521
I want to be like Angel.

01:06:54.591 --> 01:06:55.868
I don't want to be someone-

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.701
Where is she?

01:07:00.767 --> 01:07:02.775
She was in here yesterday.
I fed her.

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.535
She had a broken wing.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:07.575
- She couldn't fly away.
- I don't know.

01:07:07.648 --> 01:07:09.022
What's the matter, Julie?

01:07:10.561 --> 01:07:13.244
- Did you lose you little birdie?
- What did you do with her?

01:07:13.312 --> 01:07:15.614
The one that can't fly?

01:07:15.681 --> 01:07:17.534
It might end up in a Dumpster.

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.834
What are you- a tough guy?

01:07:19.905 --> 01:07:21.246
- Tougher than you.
- Stop it, Eric.

01:07:21.312 --> 01:07:23.647
- Yeah?
- Don't! Eric!

01:07:23.712 --> 01:07:26.298
- Where's the hawk?
- I called Animal Control, McGowen.

01:07:26.369 --> 01:07:28.224
A man came,
and he put it in a cage.

01:07:30.849 --> 01:07:33.052
- Stop it!
- I bet you he's gonna kill it...

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:34.779
and then he's gonna stuff it.

01:07:34.849 --> 01:07:36.279
Yeah!

01:07:37.153 --> 01:07:39.160
- Eric, stop. Will you stop?
- Come on, man!

01:07:40.322 --> 01:07:41.915
Stop, Eric.
Forget about him.

01:07:41.986 --> 01:07:44.288
Oh, I'm not done with you yet,
McGowen.

01:07:44.354 --> 01:07:46.296
One way or another...

01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:48.257
we're gonna finish this thing.

01:07:51.553 --> 01:07:53.560
Hi. Hi.

01:07:55.041 --> 01:07:57.529
Hi, Angel.
How'd they treat you in there?

01:07:59.138 --> 01:08:01.559
Angel ready to fly.

01:08:01.634 --> 01:08:04.667
That's impossible, Mr. Miyagi.
She's got a broken wing.

01:08:06.434 --> 01:08:08.224
Take chance.
See what happen.

01:08:08.291 --> 01:08:10.113
Nothing's going to happen.

01:08:11.267 --> 01:08:13.950
Angel decide, not Julie-san.

01:08:16.354 --> 01:08:17.881
Come on.

01:08:22.819 --> 01:08:26.234
I told you, Mr. Miyagi, she can't
fly away. She has a broken wing.

01:08:26.307 --> 01:08:28.479
We don't know that yet.

01:08:47.108 --> 01:08:49.376
Now, let wind touch bird.

01:08:54.916 --> 01:08:56.803
Maybe if you believe...

01:08:56.868 --> 01:08:58.843
Angel believe too.

01:09:03.429 --> 01:09:04.921
Now release.

01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:11.685
Okay.
Fly away, Angel.

01:09:28.134 --> 01:09:31.613
What's wrong, Angel?
You're free. Go on. Fly away.

01:09:31.685 --> 01:09:35.198
Sometimes,
when live in cage too long...

01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:38.718
whole world seem
like very big place.

01:09:42.407 --> 01:09:44.194
You're strong, Angel.

01:09:46.886 --> 01:09:48.741
I know you are.

01:09:49.926 --> 01:09:52.415
Fly away. Fly free.

01:10:00.007 --> 01:10:01.981
You healed her, Mr. Miyagi.

01:10:03.079 --> 01:10:05.926
No. Angel heal self.

01:10:07.015 --> 01:10:10.397
But your faith give her
courage to fly.

01:10:16.519 --> 01:10:18.307
Come. We go.

01:10:24.712 --> 01:10:27.810
I'm really going to miss Angel.

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:31.197
I used to talk to her a lot.
I told her everything.

01:10:32.521 --> 01:10:36.198
You lucky
you have Angel talk to.

01:10:36.265 --> 01:10:38.207
She no talk back.

01:10:39.529 --> 01:10:42.015
Maybe now you talk Miyagi...

01:10:42.087 --> 01:10:43.943
or your friend, Eric.

01:10:46.729 --> 01:10:49.958
He asked me to the senior prom.
I didn't know what to say.

01:10:51.849 --> 01:10:55.045
What problem?
You no like boy?

01:10:55.113 --> 01:10:57.219
Yeah, I like him...

01:10:57.289 --> 01:11:00.192
but it's a formal dance,
and I don't have a dress.

01:11:01.066 --> 01:11:04.066
Even if I did go,
I probably wouldn't fit in.

01:11:04.138 --> 01:11:07.848
What would happen if they started doing
an old-fashioned waltz or something?

01:11:07.914 --> 01:11:09.768
I don't know how to waltz.

01:11:10.794 --> 01:11:13.640
All things possible, Julie-san.

01:11:14.601 --> 01:11:18.431
I have to admit, though,
it was nice to get asked.

01:11:37.004 --> 01:11:39.687
May I help you, sir?

01:11:39.755 --> 01:11:41.663
Oh, yes.

01:11:41.738 --> 01:11:44.292
Want to buy dress.

01:11:44.363 --> 01:11:46.730
Formal dance- very important.

01:11:46.795 --> 01:11:49.926
Of course. Well, as you see,
we have all sorts of styles.

01:11:49.994 --> 01:11:54.053
Do you like an A-line,
or do you like a tea length?

01:11:54.123 --> 01:11:56.295
Do you like off-the-shoulder?

01:11:56.363 --> 01:12:00.073
Miyagi like everything,
but dress not for me.

01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:01.733
Dress for teenage girl.

01:12:01.804 --> 01:12:06.376
Of course. Well, what kind
of a girl is she? Is she trendy...

01:12:06.444 --> 01:12:08.168
or conservative?

01:12:08.236 --> 01:12:11.334
We can do a silk charmeuse
or a crepe de chine.

01:12:12.908 --> 01:12:15.526
Girl have good spinning back kick...

01:12:15.596 --> 01:12:18.181
but need work
on sword-hand block.

01:12:18.924 --> 01:12:22.153
Yes, that's very helpful.

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:23.595
Is she tall?

01:12:26.124 --> 01:12:29.954
Not too tall,
but not short.

01:12:30.028 --> 01:12:32.331
Not fat.

01:12:32.397 --> 01:12:34.185
Not skinny. Slender.

01:12:35.373 --> 01:12:36.682
Like this.

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:47.654
Hi, Mr. Miyagi.

01:12:48.686 --> 01:12:50.540
What are you doing?

01:12:52.014 --> 01:12:56.618
Today we practice karate
inside house.

01:12:57.358 --> 01:12:58.918
Here, in the parlor?

01:13:00.975 --> 01:13:03.113
Ready?

01:13:03.182 --> 01:13:04.808
Sure.

01:13:09.837 --> 01:13:13.187
Today Miyagi show you new kata.

01:13:13.262 --> 01:13:14.723
Okay?

01:13:14.798 --> 01:13:19.533
First, lead with left foot,
right punch.

01:13:19.598 --> 01:13:20.973
Okay.

01:13:21.039 --> 01:13:24.585
- Then Julie-san follow.
- Okay.

01:13:28.495 --> 01:13:30.732
Side step, punch.

01:13:31.983 --> 01:13:35.279
Punch, side step.

01:13:35.343 --> 01:13:37.230
Feet together.

01:13:37.295 --> 01:13:40.459
This time, Miyagi move,
you counter.

01:13:41.488 --> 01:13:42.567
Go.

01:13:46.191 --> 01:13:47.566
Feet together.

01:13:50.351 --> 01:13:51.562
Side.

01:13:52.496 --> 01:13:53.806
Once more.

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:56.717
Right?

01:13:58.256 --> 01:14:00.166
- Counter.
- Okay.

01:14:05.009 --> 01:14:07.146
Feet together.
Just a minute.

01:14:10.672 --> 01:14:11.719
Go.

01:14:18.577 --> 01:14:22.668
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

01:14:29.811 --> 01:14:32.047
I can't believe it.
I'm dancing.

01:14:33.330 --> 01:14:34.704
Where'd you learn this?

01:14:34.769 --> 01:14:38.795
Miyagi invent new kata
called "Karate Waltz."

01:14:40.498 --> 01:14:43.531
Actually,
Julie-san grandpapa teach.

01:14:43.602 --> 01:14:45.807
Was in World War Two, France.

01:14:45.875 --> 01:14:48.241
He tell Miyagi,
"You can dance.

01:14:48.306 --> 01:14:51.502
You can fight, you can dance,
you have good footwork. `

01:14:54.930 --> 01:14:57.680
I still don't know
what I'm going to wear to this thing.

01:14:57.748 --> 01:15:01.043
Oh, yes.
Miyagi forget something.

01:15:01.107 --> 01:15:03.179
You stay, practice.
I be right back.

01:15:20.499 --> 01:15:23.150
Late birthday present
from Miyagi.

01:15:27.764 --> 01:15:29.194
Oh, it's beautiful.

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:32.235
Miyagi want you to go dance.

01:15:32.309 --> 01:15:34.316
How'd you know my size?

01:15:34.388 --> 01:15:37.355
That was very difficult part.

01:15:38.388 --> 01:15:41.585
It's too bad
you never had a daughter, Mr. Miyagi.

01:15:41.653 --> 01:15:42.994
You would have been a good parent.

01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:44.878
Thank you.

01:15:47.252 --> 01:15:48.332
One minute.

01:15:54.294 --> 01:15:58.156
As a new parent,
may I have this dance?

01:16:19.509 --> 01:16:23.404
So, you call Eric,
you tell him we go dance.

01:16:24.855 --> 01:16:27.571
What do you mean, "we"?

01:16:27.639 --> 01:16:29.494
Miyagi drive car.

01:16:31.606 --> 01:16:34.672
Mr. Miyagi, it doesn't exactly
work that way.

01:16:35.446 --> 01:16:40.268
Okay, then Mr. Miyagi stay home,
wait like anxious parent.

01:16:40.342 --> 01:16:41.717
Okay.

01:17:22.617 --> 01:17:23.991
Come on.

01:18:08.953 --> 01:18:10.961
I'm Eric.
I'm here for Julie Pierce.

01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:39.826
I'm Eric McGowen.

01:18:39.899 --> 01:18:43.347
Oh, yes. Honored to meet you.
Miyagi here.

01:18:43.419 --> 01:18:46.169
I'm taking Julie
to the dance tonight.

01:18:46.236 --> 01:18:48.986
Oh, yes. Of course...

01:18:49.052 --> 01:18:52.598
you bring her home by 10:00?

01:18:52.668 --> 01:18:55.570
Well, see,
the dance goes to midnight.

01:18:57.757 --> 01:19:00.439
So, why don't I bring her back
around 1:00?

01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:06.646
What you do for extra hour?

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:11.611
Well-

01:19:11.676 --> 01:19:14.011
Treat her with respect.

01:19:14.749 --> 01:19:16.243
Right.

01:19:16.316 --> 01:19:19.034
Treat her with respect
for one hour.

01:19:20.509 --> 01:19:21.719
Good.

01:19:25.917 --> 01:19:27.543
Friend Eric here.

01:19:30.302 --> 01:19:32.603
You can come in, Mr. Miyagi.

01:19:49.599 --> 01:19:52.020
I wish my parents could see this.

01:19:53.279 --> 01:19:55.134
Oh, parents watching.

01:19:56.255 --> 01:20:00.051
I still remember what you said to me
at the monastery...

01:20:00.126 --> 01:20:02.363
about keeping them in my heart.

01:20:04.990 --> 01:20:08.471
It's a way to love someone
even if they're not with you.

01:20:09.343 --> 01:20:13.369
Parents very proud...

01:20:13.439 --> 01:20:15.295
like Miyagi-

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.214
very happy.

01:20:21.216 --> 01:20:26.137
Oh, Julie-san,
tonight you are beautiful woman.

01:20:35.712 --> 01:20:36.988
Go.

01:20:46.208 --> 01:20:47.583
Enjoy dance.

01:20:49.377 --> 01:20:52.094
Maybe Miyagi celebrate too.

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:54.616
Take monks for ride on town.

01:21:11.650 --> 01:21:13.505
See you later, guys.

01:21:19.650 --> 01:21:22.203
- Who are those people?
- Friends.

01:21:23.235 --> 01:21:26.682
- I like them.
- I like them too.

01:21:55.075 --> 01:21:57.441
That is a nice dress.

01:21:58.147 --> 01:22:00.035
You better watch the road, Eric.

01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:04.354
You know, you look like you,
but you don't look like you.

01:22:06.308 --> 01:22:09.275
- One way.
- You are so beautiful.

01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:11.995
It's a one-way street, Eric!

01:22:15.588 --> 01:22:18.905
Do you really want to do this?

01:22:26.404 --> 01:22:27.330
"Boston Bowl"

01:22:27.363 --> 01:22:28.256
"Boston Bowl"

01:22:32.548 --> 01:22:36.128
Don't touch this ball, all right?
This ball cost serious money.

01:22:36.198 --> 01:22:39.547
Sorry.
Don't understand English.

01:22:39.622 --> 01:22:41.050
Look, don't talk either.

01:22:41.125 --> 01:22:42.652
What the problem?

01:22:42.725 --> 01:22:46.173
Don't breathe, don't move.
I don't want any distractions.

01:22:46.246 --> 01:22:49.759
Perhaps we can make
a small contest.

01:22:51.334 --> 01:22:53.307
Say, buck a point?

01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:54.908
Just a minute.

01:22:59.462 --> 01:23:01.698
Do you believe these guys?
It'll be a piece of cake.

01:23:07.334 --> 01:23:08.795
Contest covered.

01:23:41.255 --> 01:23:43.111
Why do they
keep their eyes closed?

01:23:44.008 --> 01:23:46.822
It's called Zen bowling.

01:23:46.888 --> 01:23:51.394
No have to see pins,
only have to think about target.

01:24:59.627 --> 01:25:01.863
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

01:25:07.595 --> 01:25:09.220
I'm sorry.

01:25:09.931 --> 01:25:12.070
Sorry for what?

01:25:12.139 --> 01:25:14.757
For getting you in trouble
with Ned and his friends.

01:25:17.387 --> 01:25:18.848
You're worth it.

01:25:50.604 --> 01:25:52.011
Yeah!

01:26:21.517 --> 01:26:23.557
Look!

01:26:42.511 --> 01:26:43.886
Help me get him down.

01:26:44.688 --> 01:26:46.061
You all right?

01:26:47.246 --> 01:26:49.069
- I hit my arm.
- Yeah?

01:26:51.151 --> 01:26:52.526
Whose idea was this?

01:26:53.742 --> 01:26:55.750
Ned's.
Dugan said it would be all right.

01:26:55.823 --> 01:26:57.100
Leave him alone, McGowen.

01:26:57.168 --> 01:26:59.557
This is real smart, Ned.
I think you broke your buddy's arm here.

01:26:59.631 --> 01:27:02.086
At least he was
brave enough to try it.

01:27:02.159 --> 01:27:03.720
Why don't you
Just mind your business?

01:27:04.912 --> 01:27:07.115
- You're okay, right?
- Yeah.

01:27:22.447 --> 01:27:24.008
- Those guys are idiots.
- Right here, McGowen.

01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:26.502
- Oh, yeah?
- Don't fight.

01:27:28.337 --> 01:27:29.547
Jerk.

01:27:29.616 --> 01:27:32.431
McGowen just challenged me.

01:27:32.496 --> 01:27:34.885
I'm not letting him
get away with this.

01:27:34.961 --> 01:27:36.172
Absolutely.

01:27:50.417 --> 01:27:52.807
None of this would have happened
if it hadn't been for me.

01:27:54.865 --> 01:27:57.767
What?
What are you talking about?

01:27:57.841 --> 01:28:00.209
Hey, listen,
I'm glad this happened.

01:28:00.274 --> 01:28:03.121
Forget about Dugan.
I don't need him.

01:28:03.186 --> 01:28:05.968
I'm gonna live my life
my way.

01:28:06.994 --> 01:28:09.002
Sometimes that's difficult.

01:28:10.034 --> 01:28:11.726
Not when I'm with you.

01:28:19.282 --> 01:28:23.560
So, Mr. Miyagi is
teaching you karate?

01:28:24.563 --> 01:28:26.734
- Yeah, a little.
- Yeah?

01:28:30.098 --> 01:28:34.059
So, if I try to kiss you,
will you use it?

01:28:35.059 --> 01:28:38.190
- The sun is warm. The grass is green.
- What?

01:28:41.076 --> 01:28:42.253
Nothing.

01:28:54.163 --> 01:28:55.724
What was that?

01:28:55.796 --> 01:28:58.065
Let's go, McGowen.

01:29:02.772 --> 01:29:04.267
Are you all right?

01:29:12.372 --> 01:29:14.641
I'll see you at the docks,
McGowen...

01:29:14.708 --> 01:29:17.459
if you're brave enough to go.

01:29:18.644 --> 01:29:22.671
- You all right? Look at this.
- Yeah. Let's call the police.

01:29:22.741 --> 01:29:24.945
Why? What's the point? They're
Just going to lie about what happened.

01:29:25.014 --> 01:29:27.152
- What are we going to do?
- We are not doing anything.

01:29:27.221 --> 01:29:29.677
I'm going to settle this thing
once and for all.

01:30:09.528 --> 01:30:12.843
- Where's your little buddies, Ned?
- I didn't think you were gonna show.

01:30:12.919 --> 01:30:14.544
Yeah?

01:30:14.614 --> 01:30:16.655
It's one on one.

01:30:16.727 --> 01:30:18.930
One on one, man.
Now I'm gonna teach you how to fight.

01:30:18.998 --> 01:30:21.934
You want a piece of me?
Now's the time.

01:30:22.008 --> 01:30:23.382
Let's go.

01:30:28.568 --> 01:30:30.422
Remember the bullring, McGowen?

01:30:32.792 --> 01:30:35.923
As I recall, you didn't think much
of that particular exercise.

01:30:35.992 --> 01:30:38.065
Maybe now you wish you'd
paid more attention.

01:30:38.137 --> 01:30:39.859
I got a piece of you, didn't I?

01:30:39.927 --> 01:30:43.637
Yes, you did.
Now it's payback time.

01:30:44.888 --> 01:30:48.303
Well, son, this time you've
bitten off more than you can chew.

01:30:48.376 --> 01:30:50.710
- Let me have him, Ned.
- Not now, Charlie.

01:30:50.776 --> 01:30:53.908
We're a team.
We're gonna do this together.

01:30:53.977 --> 01:30:56.759
- Come on. Come on!
- Light it.

01:31:08.793 --> 01:31:10.615
Come on, McGowen,
let's go.

01:31:20.058 --> 01:31:21.268
Come on, Eric.

01:31:23.546 --> 01:31:24.756
Pick him up.

01:31:31.386 --> 01:31:34.617
We haven't even started yet, McGowen.
Come on.

01:31:37.978 --> 01:31:40.596
You wanted me, McGowen.
You wanted a piece of me, right?

01:31:43.802 --> 01:31:46.192
- Well, you got it.
- Get up!

01:31:50.363 --> 01:31:52.337
You're not that tough.
Come on.

01:31:52.411 --> 01:31:53.939
Come here! Come here!

01:32:00.155 --> 01:32:02.392
You're not gonna quit.
Come on, quitter.

01:32:08.955 --> 01:32:12.468
Oh, come on, McGowen. I thought
you were tougher than that, pal.

01:32:15.355 --> 01:32:18.422
Higher.
I want to see his eyes.

01:32:18.492 --> 01:32:20.793
- Thanks for showing up, McGowen.
- Anytime.

01:32:22.781 --> 01:32:24.024
Pick him up.

01:32:27.228 --> 01:32:29.116
Come here. Come here.

01:32:30.781 --> 01:32:33.269
Finish him off.

01:32:35.613 --> 01:32:37.653
What are you all looking at?

01:32:37.725 --> 01:32:39.896
What do you think
I've been training you for?

01:32:40.605 --> 01:32:41.979
Ned, kick him.

01:32:43.452 --> 01:32:44.979
Do it!

01:32:46.814 --> 01:32:49.334
- Dugan, he's down.
- Pick him up!

01:32:49.406 --> 01:32:52.472
- Do it.
- Please.

01:33:16.702 --> 01:33:17.749
What?

01:33:22.143 --> 01:33:23.965
- Get out of here.
- Come on.

01:33:24.030 --> 01:33:25.557
Come. I call police.

01:33:25.631 --> 01:33:29.406
McGowen was speeding around in his car.
Obviously he had a car accident.

01:33:29.472 --> 01:33:30.781
That's a lie, man.

01:33:30.847 --> 01:33:35.069
Is no accident when fight is
five against one.

01:33:35.135 --> 01:33:37.918
Ned here could have beaten McGowen
with his arms behind his back.

01:33:37.983 --> 01:33:40.536
Come. We go.

01:33:40.607 --> 01:33:42.363
Julie- What?

01:33:42.431 --> 01:33:43.860
What, are you kidding me?

01:33:45.215 --> 01:33:47.866
- Let me fight him.
- You want to fight me?

01:33:48.928 --> 01:33:51.743
Julie-san, no fighting.

01:33:51.808 --> 01:33:54.907
- Please.
- Colonel, she wants to fight me.

01:33:56.928 --> 01:33:59.318
If I'm ever going to respect myself,
I have to do this.

01:34:01.345 --> 01:34:03.255
Mr. Miyagi, please tell her
she's gonna get hurt.

01:34:06.624 --> 01:34:08.412
Julie-san right.

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:11.099
Now is time.

01:34:16.609 --> 01:34:21.497
Just remember:
True strength come from inside.

01:34:24.609 --> 01:34:26.431
If you're gonna do this...

01:34:26.498 --> 01:34:29.564
you put her away.

01:34:29.634 --> 01:34:31.488
Do you understand me?

01:34:34.529 --> 01:34:36.918
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

01:34:49.154 --> 01:34:51.904
Guys, this is really embarrassing.

01:34:53.251 --> 01:34:55.423
But okay.

01:34:55.491 --> 01:34:57.017
Give me your best shot.

01:35:12.354 --> 01:35:13.565
Slow down!

01:35:13.635 --> 01:35:15.739
Use your strength.

01:35:29.444 --> 01:35:32.476
That was really good, Julie.
It really was.

01:35:36.387 --> 01:35:37.565
Stop this!

01:35:39.172 --> 01:35:40.797
But it wasn't good enough.

01:35:40.867 --> 01:35:42.242
Come on!

01:35:51.844 --> 01:35:53.339
Focus, Julie-san.

01:36:21.637 --> 01:36:25.249
All over, Julie-san.
We go.

01:36:25.318 --> 01:36:27.356
What are you talking about?

01:36:27.431 --> 01:36:29.471
The war is not over
because one battle's lost.

01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:33.600
- Charlie'll fight her.
- No, sir.

01:36:33.670 --> 01:36:36.484
- Come on, Charlie. I said, fight her!
- No, sir. What are you doing? No!

01:36:38.630 --> 01:36:40.059
You're crazy, man.

01:36:41.735 --> 01:36:44.637
- Morgan, you fight her.
- Colonel, it's over.

01:36:46.855 --> 01:36:48.927
Ned, get up and finish the job.

01:36:50.215 --> 01:36:52.932
I said,
get up and finish the job!

01:36:52.999 --> 01:36:54.788
- No more.
- What?

01:36:56.231 --> 01:36:57.890
Enough!

01:36:57.959 --> 01:36:59.715
It's not over.

01:36:59.783 --> 01:37:01.954
Then we finish.

01:37:12.487 --> 01:37:13.862
Absolutely.

01:37:16.744 --> 01:37:18.599
I'm gonna put your lights out.

01:37:59.817 --> 01:38:02.239
Time put your lights out.

01:38:26.219 --> 01:38:28.291
You said you had
all the answers, Colonel.

01:38:41.739 --> 01:38:44.555
- You were great.
- Not great.

01:38:49.996 --> 01:38:51.851
You kicked some butt.

01:38:52.844 --> 01:38:57.961
Julie-san, how many times Miyagi say
fighting not good?

01:38:58.027 --> 01:39:00.483
I know.
Somebody always gets hurt.

01:39:02.315 --> 01:39:04.770
Mr. Miyagi,
come on, admit it:

01:39:04.843 --> 01:39:06.305
We kicked some butt.

01:39:08.493 --> 01:39:10.631
Fighting not good...

01:39:10.700 --> 01:39:14.377
but if must fight, win.
