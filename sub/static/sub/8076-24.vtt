[doorbell ringing]

00:08.576 --> 00:09.977
Hello.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.079
Hello, hello.

00:11.112 --> 00:14.515
We come bearing gifts,
dolls and a tea set.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.517
And a GI Joe and a football.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.852
We figure we'll put them at
opposite ends of her room

00:18.886 --> 00:22.423
and let her gender
identify herself.

00:22.456 --> 00:23.524
Ah to be young again.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.359
So where is she?

00:25.393 --> 00:27.095
She's so cute, you
know, she doesn't

00:27.128 --> 00:29.930
really belong in this family.

00:29.963 --> 00:33.967
Leon, we all started out cute.

00:34.001 --> 00:36.404
Well, I'm going up to
check on her right now

00:36.437 --> 00:39.773
and I'll let you all know when
she's ready to receive guests.

00:39.807 --> 00:43.744
Well, Bev is still out there
trying to park the Iconoline.

00:43.777 --> 00:47.014
Oh yes, none of you happens
to own a red Dotson, do you?

00:47.047 --> 00:48.949
I do, why?

00:48.982 --> 00:50.351
No reason, really.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.453
It's just-- it's very sporty.

00:56.124 --> 00:56.990
Sorry I'm late.

00:57.024 --> 00:58.792
A couple of Mason jars exploded.

00:58.826 --> 01:01.162
No jam this Christmas.

01:01.195 --> 01:02.796
Oh rats.

01:02.830 --> 01:03.797
Rats, rats, rats.

01:07.868 --> 01:10.003
I'm ready to see my name sake.

01:10.037 --> 01:11.339
Sound the trumpets.

01:11.372 --> 01:14.608
Tell her that her great
grandmother is here.

01:14.642 --> 01:16.310
Don't worry,
she's been warned.

01:18.812 --> 01:19.747
[music playing]

01:19.780 --> 01:23.151
What doesn't kill us
is making us stronger.

01:23.184 --> 01:27.121
We're gonna last longer than
that greatest wall in China

01:27.155 --> 01:30.591
or that rabbit with a drum.

01:30.624 --> 01:35.563
If there's one thing that
I've learned while waiting

01:35.596 --> 01:40.000
for my turn, it's that
[inaudible] rain falls

01:40.033 --> 01:43.471
but you also get some sun.

01:43.504 --> 01:47.941
And we'll make out
better than OK.

01:47.975 --> 01:49.377
Hear what I say.

02:05.393 --> 02:06.694
I hear movement.

02:06.727 --> 02:09.997
Oh, man, she's awake.

02:10.030 --> 02:12.166
Hey, hey, hey, one at a time.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.235
You people are scary
enough individually.

02:14.268 --> 02:15.903
Well, we just want to
see the baby, Roseanne.

02:15.936 --> 02:16.804
Me first.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.206
Me first.

02:18.239 --> 02:21.642
OK, OK, we're going
in order of sanity.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.377
Well, we can't all be last.

02:29.450 --> 02:34.255
Oh, you must be so cold
in this drafty old house.

02:34.288 --> 02:37.758
Oh look, so cute and tiny.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.360
I just want to put
you on a key chain.

02:42.496 --> 02:46.267
Oh, look at this, Harris.

02:46.300 --> 02:51.772
This is a picture of your
mother when she was a teenager.

02:51.805 --> 02:54.708
She never was much of a smiler.

02:54.742 --> 03:00.013
And this is my daughter,
your grandmother.

03:00.047 --> 03:05.118
I don't know who that child
is she's holding under water.

03:05.152 --> 03:08.188
Oh my, my baby's a grandmother.

03:08.222 --> 03:11.659
My head is spinning.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.494
Oh, I almost forgot.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.230
I have set you up with
a little savings bond.

03:21.669 --> 03:25.839
Now, it could be
for college or a car

03:25.873 --> 03:32.179
when you're 16 or, in case
your husband runs out on you

03:32.212 --> 03:36.450
and leaves you broke and
depressed and miserable

03:36.484 --> 03:38.852
and angry at the whole world.

03:38.886 --> 03:39.687
Anyway--

03:44.492 --> 03:46.594
Hi, Harris.

03:46.627 --> 03:49.229
You're such a beautiful child.

03:49.263 --> 03:50.564
And I know your
life is going to be

03:50.598 --> 03:53.834
filled with love and happiness.

03:53.867 --> 03:56.370
Did that sound sincere?

03:56.404 --> 03:58.339
A lot of times people
accuse me of not sounding

03:58.372 --> 04:01.609
sincere when I really am.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.210
Hey, Harris, you're
going to be a star.

04:06.947 --> 04:11.785
Good evening, this is a
little piece I call baby.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.526
Baby's eye.

04:18.559 --> 04:21.161
Baby's chin.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.863
Baby's ear.

04:22.896 --> 04:25.766
Put them all together
and you have baby.

04:29.169 --> 04:31.305
This has been a DJ Conner film.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.144
She's smiling Oh precious.

04:37.177 --> 04:40.914
[baby talk]

04:40.948 --> 04:41.749
What are you doing?

04:45.486 --> 04:48.188
This is Aunt Scott
and Aunt [inaudible]..

04:50.658 --> 04:51.525
Hi.

04:51.559 --> 04:53.026
Do the angry face.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.061
The one I like.

04:54.094 --> 04:54.895
That's it.

04:58.165 --> 05:00.834
Hey, if you ever need
somebody to talk to, I mean,

05:00.868 --> 05:02.202
when you can.

05:02.235 --> 05:03.604
I'm a good listener.

05:03.637 --> 05:07.908
I'm not pushy like some
people in his family.

05:07.941 --> 05:11.111
I'm not naming names.

05:11.144 --> 05:15.516
Hey, give grandpa
a big smile, huh?

05:15.549 --> 05:16.350
Huh?

05:20.388 --> 05:23.824
[baby talking]

05:23.857 --> 05:27.495
God, Darlene is so lucky.

05:27.528 --> 05:28.762
Hey, so when are
we going to tell

05:28.796 --> 05:32.165
everybody that we're lucky too?

05:32.199 --> 05:34.167
Mark, we just found out.

05:34.201 --> 05:36.804
It's too early to say anything.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.839
Besides, we don't want to
take all the attention away

05:38.872 --> 05:40.708
from Darlene.

05:40.741 --> 05:41.942
Yeah, let's wait
a couple of weeks

05:41.975 --> 05:45.446
until they're tired of the baby.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.748
Hey, do think it would
be OK if I touched her?

05:47.781 --> 05:50.418
Let me see your hands.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.486
No.

05:52.520 --> 05:56.123
Harris, this is your cousin
Andy and your uncle Jerry.

05:56.156 --> 06:00.060
Oh honey, oh geez.

06:00.093 --> 06:00.894
OK.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.936
Hey.

06:08.969 --> 06:11.539
Had a lot of visitors
today, didn't you.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.373
I hope nobody frightened
you because they

06:13.407 --> 06:14.341
all love you very much.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.079
There's a lot of love
here in this house.

06:21.882 --> 06:27.821
You might hear some yelling or
some naughty words sometimes.

06:27.855 --> 06:31.191
But sometimes the
love is just so strong

06:31.224 --> 06:32.225
that they can't contain it.

06:36.096 --> 06:40.734
Hey kid, I used lava.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.235
Here you go.

06:42.269 --> 06:44.438
Here you go.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.707
Oh man.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.510
This dad thing is
going to be great.

06:49.543 --> 06:52.412
You guys, that
baby is so wonderful.

06:52.446 --> 06:53.346
Thanks, Nancy.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.649
No, I mean, she's
really special.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.284
Wouldn't it be incredible
if she turned out to be

06:57.317 --> 06:59.019
the first woman president.

06:59.052 --> 07:03.491
I think it's more important
to raise honest children.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.292
You know, seeing the
bay, and then seeing you,

07:05.325 --> 07:07.127
and then seeing the baby
again made me realize

07:07.160 --> 07:08.862
that, hey, you're a real dad.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.197
Get over here.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.468
It is.

07:14.502 --> 07:17.671
It's starting to feel
that way just now.

07:17.705 --> 07:20.373
Mr. Conner, when did you
start to feel like a real dad?

07:20.407 --> 07:23.376
Oh, well, that was when
we had little Jerry.

07:23.410 --> 07:26.079
I had had some
children before that,

07:26.113 --> 07:29.349
but they were just for practice.

07:29.382 --> 07:31.552
I think it became real
for me at my wedding

07:31.585 --> 07:33.453
when I was breastfeeding
Andy at the altar.

07:36.356 --> 07:39.292
Nah, first time I held Becky,
the way she looked at me,

07:39.326 --> 07:40.861
you never forget that.

07:40.894 --> 07:43.196
Yeah, those little blue
eyes that know nothing

07:43.230 --> 07:45.766
about the world around them.

07:45.799 --> 07:49.202
Hm, she still looks like that.

07:49.236 --> 07:52.072
Gosh, baby is just so amazing.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.575
Can't wait till I'm a dad.

07:54.608 --> 07:55.743
I think you will.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.745
Oh now, you never know, Dan.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.580
Kids these days are
having sex a lot sooner.

07:59.613 --> 08:00.681
Things happen.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.082
I don't think so.

08:02.115 --> 08:05.185
Leon and I have a little
announcement to make, don't we?

08:05.218 --> 08:06.720
- No, we don't.
- Yes we do.

08:06.754 --> 08:07.788
How can we keep quiet?

08:07.821 --> 08:09.089
It is in the air.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.091
All right, I will tell them.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.727
Scott and I are going to
adopt a baby which I think

08:13.761 --> 08:15.262
I told you all at Thanksgiving.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.230
Yes, and I behaved dreadfully.

08:17.264 --> 08:18.932
Yes, and not for
the first time.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.801
And all is
forgiven, sweetheart.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.069
All is forgiven.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.872
At any rate, today I am
overjoyed to announce that we

08:24.905 --> 08:27.875
have begun the adoption
paperwork and in two

08:27.908 --> 08:30.343
months we will be
the proud parents

08:30.377 --> 08:32.445
of little 3-year-old Nadia.

08:32.479 --> 08:33.714
Oh.

08:33.747 --> 08:35.315
She is from Romania.

08:35.348 --> 08:38.085
We're going to San
Francisco to pick her up.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.853
Imagine that, we're
going to San Francisco

08:39.887 --> 08:42.690
and we're going
to pick up a girl.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.324
You guys are
rescuing a little girl?

08:44.357 --> 08:45.593
You are the best.

08:45.626 --> 08:48.328
Your karma rating just
went through the roof.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.064
Well, I couldn't be happier.

08:51.098 --> 08:53.634
I can't think of
two better mothers.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.737
Still, it is a
big responsibility.

08:56.770 --> 08:59.873
You will need some experienced
parents to give you advice.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.809
Leave them alone,
mother, unless you

09:01.842 --> 09:04.144
want to take five or 10 seconds
and write down everything

09:04.177 --> 09:05.946
you know.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.816
I mean, babies
are hard enough.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.951
And then once they
start toddling, I mean,

09:10.984 --> 09:12.953
you have to watch
them every minute.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.355
Well, I'm going to
take even minutes.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.890
And Leon will take the odd.

09:16.924 --> 09:17.858
No, the other way around.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.126
Well, whatever.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.994
Roseanne was always
getting into everything.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.930
You know, you would
sit under the sink

09:22.963 --> 09:24.798
with a bucket on her head.

09:24.832 --> 09:27.768
And she made me stand
guard with a broom.

09:27.801 --> 09:31.271
I never understood
what she was hiding from.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.572
OK guys, lunch is here.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.775
Courtesy of Uncle Wongs.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.844
I'll go help
mom set the table.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.412
You know, that place in
on their third Uncle Wong.

09:39.446 --> 09:42.482
It's like Lassie.

09:42.515 --> 09:45.485
Man, there's a lot
of people out there.

09:45.518 --> 09:47.420
Yeah, well as soon as
the free food is gone,

09:47.454 --> 09:49.022
they'll be gone too.

09:49.056 --> 09:52.592
You know, mom, it really
is too crowded around here.

09:52.626 --> 09:54.327
So Dave and I were thinking
that instead of spending

09:54.361 --> 09:56.229
a couple of months here, we
could probably be out of here

09:56.263 --> 09:58.966
in a couple of weeks.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.201
A couple weeks
isn't long enough

10:01.234 --> 10:04.271
for me to teach you all the
stuff that I want to teach you.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.106
I mean, when we had
that talk you said you

10:06.139 --> 10:07.474
wanted to learn stuff from me.

10:07.507 --> 10:11.611
I mean, what would you do if
the baby got an ear infection?

10:11.645 --> 10:14.447
Talk to her from
the opposite side.

10:14.481 --> 10:15.816
No, I'm serious, Darlene.

10:15.849 --> 10:18.185
I mean, I just want to make
sure that you know this stuff.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.587
Well, there's
always the phone, mom.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.623
Because I know you don't want
us camping out here forever.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.893
I mean, you made
that pretty clear.

10:25.926 --> 10:26.794
When?

10:26.827 --> 10:29.529
When did I make that clear?

10:29.562 --> 10:32.332
For now.

10:32.365 --> 10:35.635
You're the one that
said for now, first.

10:35.669 --> 10:38.438
Well, you didn't exactly
beg me to stay around here.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.639
Well, OK.

10:39.673 --> 10:40.874
So do you want me
to beg you to stay?

10:40.908 --> 10:41.909
Please, please, please.

10:41.942 --> 10:42.943
Stay, stay, stay.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.746
I beg you, I double dog beg you.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.748
Is that clear enough
there for now?

10:50.751 --> 10:53.220
I want to stay
home with you, mom.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.455
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.791
You do?

10:57.825 --> 10:58.625
For how long?

11:01.528 --> 11:04.097
You first.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.498
OK, well this
is just my opening

11:05.532 --> 11:09.169
negotiating point, forever.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.041
Well, seeing as I
plan to out live you,

11:14.074 --> 11:17.410
I'll meet you halfway.

11:17.444 --> 11:18.912
It's a deal.

11:18.946 --> 11:19.980
So welcome home, Darlene.

11:22.950 --> 11:25.385
You're grounded.

11:25.418 --> 11:27.387
Hey, what's with the food?

11:27.420 --> 11:28.221
Shut up.

11:31.491 --> 11:32.292
Oh, I love it here.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.002
Was I right?

11:42.035 --> 11:44.271
Can Uncle Wongs whip
up a lo mein or what?

11:44.304 --> 11:45.438
No, no, that's chow mein.

11:45.472 --> 11:46.740
You can tell by the noodles.

11:46.774 --> 11:47.707
Yeah.

11:47.741 --> 11:49.777
All Chinese
noodles are the same.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.011
Oh dad, that's ridiculous.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.512
Come on, dad, lo
mein noodles are soft.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.514
Chow mein noodles
are hard and crispy.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.150
OK, I'm warning everybody,
I'm not going to live through

11:57.184 --> 11:59.386
another version of
that pepperoni-sausage

11:59.419 --> 12:01.755
debate from last week.

12:01.789 --> 12:04.224
They are completely
different parts of the cow.

12:04.257 --> 12:05.993
Bull.

12:06.026 --> 12:11.932
All meat, meat bi-products,
rodent parts, hair, sawdust,

12:11.965 --> 12:13.700
encased in a tube, our sausage.

12:18.638 --> 12:20.607
ROSEANNE (VOICEOVER): Everyone
wonders where creative people

12:20.640 --> 12:22.742
get their inspiration.

12:22.776 --> 12:26.046
Actually, I found
It's all around you.

12:26.079 --> 12:30.150
Take Leon, for instance.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.019
Manners police,
I'm sorry, Dan.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.454
No whiffling at the
dining room table.

12:34.487 --> 12:35.588
ROSEANNE (VOICEOVER):
Leon is not

12:35.622 --> 12:37.457
really as cool as I made him.

12:37.490 --> 12:40.493
He's the only gay guy I know
who belongs to the Elks Club.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.295
Now as far as I'm
concerned, George Bush

12:42.329 --> 12:44.064
was president we ever had.

12:44.097 --> 12:48.335
I mean, look at all the
fat he cut out of Medicare.

12:48.368 --> 12:49.436
You know, in
China they believe

12:49.469 --> 12:52.072
in reincarnation so they
have a hell of a time

12:52.105 --> 12:54.374
with their probate law.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.009
ROSEANNE (VOICEOVER):
Then there's Scott.

12:56.043 --> 12:58.778
He really is a probate
lawyer I met about a year ago

12:58.812 --> 13:00.848
and introduced to Leon.

13:00.881 --> 13:03.917
I guess I didn't get
too creative there.

13:03.951 --> 13:07.720
Hey DJ, quit Bogarting
the moo goo gai pan.

13:07.754 --> 13:08.856
Really, come on.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.958
Yeah, well Darlene took
all the pot stickers.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.359
And now that
you're distracted,

13:12.392 --> 13:13.193
I took the moo goo gai pan.

13:16.463 --> 13:20.533
Confucius say, you
snooze, you lose.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.536
Oh thinning son.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.139
ROSEANNE (VOICEOVER): A lot of
kids have called my son a nerd.

13:26.173 --> 13:30.677
But as I told him, they called
Steven Spielberg and nerd, too.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.046
A lot of times nerds
are really artists

13:33.080 --> 13:37.784
who just listen to the beat
of a different drummer.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.619
Roseanne, will you keep
your children in line.

13:39.652 --> 13:43.556
I didn't raise my children
to throw chopsticks.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.258
ROSEANNE (VOICEOVER): My
mom came from a generation

13:45.292 --> 13:48.395
where women were supposed to
be submissive about everything.

13:48.428 --> 13:51.899
I never bought into that and
I wish mom hadn't either.

13:51.932 --> 13:54.634
I wish she had made
different choices.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.569
So I think that's
why I made her gay.

13:56.603 --> 13:59.839
I wanted her to have some
sense of herself as a woman.

13:59.873 --> 14:03.043
You may think I'm crazy, but
it is the women's movement that

14:03.076 --> 14:05.845
has destroyed the family unit.

14:05.879 --> 14:09.749
ROSEANNE (VOICEOVER):
Oh yeah, and she's nuts.

14:09.782 --> 14:12.052
Hey man, check
out my fortune here.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.854
True love lies where
you least expect it.

14:14.888 --> 14:17.257
Better not.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.859
Mark, I think I got yours,
deepest thoughts run shallow.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.197
There's lucky
numbers on the back.

14:24.231 --> 14:25.065
Let's play the lottery.

14:28.401 --> 14:29.502
No thanks.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.138
I can't get rid of
all this money now.

14:33.941 --> 14:36.209
ROSEANNE (VOICEOVER): My sister,
in real life, unlike my mother,

14:36.243 --> 14:37.677
is gay.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.547
She always told me she was gay
but for some reason I always

14:40.580 --> 14:42.882
pictured her with the man.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.985
She's been my rock
and I would not have

14:45.018 --> 14:47.054
made it this far without her.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.189
I guess Nancy is
kind of my hero, too.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.657
You guys, women's
shelter needs furniture.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.159
So if there's anything
you don't want,

14:52.192 --> 14:53.460
let me know and I'll
have it picked up.

14:53.493 --> 14:54.561
ROSEANNE (VOICEOVER):
Because she

14:54.594 --> 14:56.363
got out of a terrible
marriage and found

14:56.396 --> 14:58.098
a great spiritual strength.

14:58.131 --> 14:59.766
I don't know what happened
to that husband of hers

14:59.799 --> 15:01.601
but in my book I sent
him into outer space.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.242
When Becky brought David home
a few years ago I thought,

15:09.276 --> 15:10.243
this is wrong.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.479
He was much more Darlene's type.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.014
Do you want to go
to this poetry reading

15:14.047 --> 15:16.216
before the museum?
- Yeah, before.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.550
I want to pick up
some books first.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.785
Oh great.

15:18.818 --> 15:20.253
ROSEANNE (VOICEOVER):
When Darlene met Mark,

15:20.287 --> 15:22.622
I thought he went
better with Becky.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.024
Get me a beer.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.625
Get it yourself, slob.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.160
ROSEANNE (VOICEOVER):
I guess I was wrong.

15:27.194 --> 15:30.097
But I still think they'd
be more compatible

15:30.130 --> 15:31.965
the other way around.

15:31.999 --> 15:36.403
So in my writing, I did what
any good mother would do,

15:36.436 --> 15:37.370
I fixed it.

15:42.309 --> 15:45.312
I lost Dan last year when
he had his heart attack.

15:50.950 --> 15:54.321
He's still the first thing
I think about when I wake up

15:54.354 --> 15:57.824
and the last thing I think
about before I go to sleep.

15:57.857 --> 15:58.658
I miss him.

16:15.342 --> 16:16.143
DAN: Rosie.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.118
Roseanne.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.163
ROSEANNE (VOICEOVER):
Dan and I always felt

16:36.196 --> 16:39.066
that it was our
responsibility as parents

16:39.099 --> 16:43.803
to improve the lives of our
children by 50% over our own.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.039
And we did.

16:46.073 --> 16:50.077
We didn't hit our
children as we were hit.

16:50.110 --> 16:53.946
We didn't demand their
unquestioning silence.

16:53.980 --> 16:56.449
And we didn't teach our
daughters to sacrifice more

16:56.483 --> 16:59.319
than our sons.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.754
As a modern wife, I
walked a tightrope

17:01.788 --> 17:03.423
between tradition and progress.

17:03.456 --> 17:06.693
And usually, I failed by
one outsider's standards

17:06.726 --> 17:08.395
or another's.

17:08.428 --> 17:11.198
But I figured out that neither
winning nor losing count

17:11.231 --> 17:14.167
for women like they do for men.

17:14.201 --> 17:20.107
We women are the ones who
transform everything we touch

17:20.140 --> 17:23.776
and nothing on earth
is higher than that.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.845
My writing is really what
got me through the last year

17:25.878 --> 17:26.979
after Dan died.

17:27.013 --> 17:29.749
I mean, at first, I felt
so be treated as if he

17:29.782 --> 17:32.752
had left me for another woman.

17:32.785 --> 17:35.322
When you're a blue collar
woman and your husband dies,

17:35.355 --> 17:39.926
it takes away your
whole sense of security.

17:39.959 --> 17:43.830
So I began writing about having
all the money in the world.

17:43.863 --> 17:45.832
And I imagined
myself going to spas

17:45.865 --> 17:48.868
and swanky New York parties
just like the people on TV

17:48.901 --> 17:51.171
where nobody has any real
problems and everything

17:51.204 --> 17:54.241
solved within 30 minutes.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.942
I tried to imagine
myself as Mary

17:55.975 --> 17:58.845
Richards, Jeannie, that girl.

17:58.878 --> 18:02.582
But I was so angry I was more
like a female Steven Segal,

18:02.615 --> 18:05.352
wanting to fight
the whole world.

18:05.385 --> 18:08.955
For a while I lost myself in
food and in a depression so

18:08.988 --> 18:12.492
deep that I couldn't even
get out of bed until I saw

18:12.525 --> 18:15.295
that my family needed
me to pull through so

18:15.328 --> 18:18.431
that they could pull through.

18:18.465 --> 18:24.671
One day, I actually imagined
being with another man.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.573
But then I felt so guilty
I had to pretend it

18:26.606 --> 18:28.408
was for some altruistic reason.

18:31.311 --> 18:35.615
And then Darlene had the
baby and it almost died.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.784
I snapped out of the
morning immediately

18:37.817 --> 18:40.687
and all of my life energy
turned into choosing life.

18:43.723 --> 18:46.826
In choosing life, I
realized that my dreams

18:46.859 --> 18:48.961
of being a writer
wouldn't just come true.

18:48.995 --> 18:50.863
I had to do the work.

18:50.897 --> 18:53.500
And as I wrote about
my life, I relived it.

18:53.533 --> 18:56.936
And whatever I didn't
like, I rearranged.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.772
I made a commitment
to finish my story,

18:59.806 --> 19:02.074
even if I had to
write in the basement

19:02.108 --> 19:05.745
in the middle of the night
while everyone else was asleep.

19:05.778 --> 19:08.548
But the more I wrote, the
more I understood myself

19:08.581 --> 19:10.683
and why I had made
the choices I made.

19:10.717 --> 19:14.086
And that was the real jackpot.

19:14.120 --> 19:17.156
I learned that dreams
don't work without action.

19:17.190 --> 19:20.993
I learned that no one
could stop me but me.

19:21.027 --> 19:23.596
I learned that love
is stronger than hate.

19:26.599 --> 19:30.703
And most important, I
learned that God does exist.

19:30.737 --> 19:36.776
He and/or she is right inside
you, underneath the pain,

19:36.809 --> 19:40.913
the sorrow and the shame.

19:40.947 --> 19:46.052
I think I'll be a lot better
now that this book is done.

19:46.085 --> 19:46.986
DJ: Happy birthday, mom.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.356
Here, pencils.

19:49.389 --> 19:50.823
DARLENE: Yeah, and I
got you some notepads.

19:50.857 --> 19:53.826
DAVID: And I got you a
dictionary and a thesaurus.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.362
DAN: You know, Stephen
King started this way.

20:04.170 --> 20:05.272
[music playing]

20:05.305 --> 20:10.410
If what doesn't kill us
is making us stronger,

20:10.443 --> 20:16.749
we're going to last longer
than the greatest wall in China

20:16.783 --> 20:20.353
or that rabbit with a drum.

20:20.387 --> 20:25.892
If there's one thing that
I've learned while waiting

20:25.925 --> 20:29.462
for my turn, it's
that in each life

20:29.496 --> 20:35.001
some rain falls but
you also get some sun.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.069
We'll make out better than OK.

20:39.906 --> 20:46.846
Hear what I say, any day.

21:00.427 --> 21:09.402
[laughing]

21:09.436 --> 21:13.306
[music playing]
