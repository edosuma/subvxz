Yes.

This El Niño is a real drag.

00:21.550 --> 00:23.283
It's supposed to be

white Christmas,
not wet Christmas.

00:25.020 --> 00:27.020
Uh, we are working on it.

00:27.022 --> 00:28.354
I don't think the mix
is cold enough.

00:28.356 --> 00:29.755
It'll be covered.

00:29.757 --> 00:31.757
If Toby bothers
to come back.

00:31.759 --> 00:34.392
I'm going very south
on Christmas this year.

00:34.394 --> 00:36.494
This holiday nonsense
is killing me.

00:36.496 --> 00:39.363
I think Ralph might say
Christmas is fun.

TOBY:
In a city that collapses

00:40.699 --> 00:42.032
into gridlock
over a light drizzle,

00:42.034 --> 00:43.733
let alone seven days
of downpour?

00:43.735 --> 00:45.067
Is that your idea of fun?

00:45.069 --> 00:46.234
It is not.

00:46.236 --> 00:48.035
Christmas spirit.

00:48.037 --> 00:49.736
Apocryphal state of mind
that doesn't really exist.

00:49.738 --> 00:51.471
We get it. "Humbug."

00:51.473 --> 00:53.272
Humbug is right.
And it's about to go viral

00:53.274 --> 00:55.307
when Cabe sees the dent
I put in his ride.

00:55.309 --> 00:57.409
Anyway, I got the stupid
ammonium nitrate.

00:57.411 --> 00:59.310
There's one more
bag in the car.

00:59.312 --> 01:00.811
Where's Walter?

01:00.813 --> 01:02.412
Walter, Toby's back!

01:05.083 --> 01:06.382
Walter?

01:07.284 --> 01:09.350
No.

01:09.352 --> 01:11.485
I swear I saw him
go upstairs.

01:12.554 --> 01:14.086
I mean, it's not
a definitive failure.

01:14.088 --> 01:15.620
I have put
some thought into this.

01:15.622 --> 01:19.256
What if there was a way to take
the technology, and then...

01:19.258 --> 01:20.824
Um, are you on the phone?

01:20.826 --> 01:22.826
Huh? No.

01:22.828 --> 01:25.261
Oh, so you were just talking
to Ferret Bueller?

01:25.263 --> 01:26.963
Does he answer back?

01:26.964 --> 01:28.664
Has Toby returned
with my ammonium nitrate?

01:28.666 --> 01:30.298
He did.
Happy took it from him.

01:30.300 --> 01:32.099
Okay. We should be ready.

01:32.101 --> 01:34.668
Hold that.

01:34.670 --> 01:36.253
Give me that.

01:36.254 --> 01:37.837
Um, you do realize you were just
talking to yourself, right?

01:37.839 --> 01:40.739
Must have been running
some calculations.

01:40.741 --> 01:43.141

Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:48.180 --> 01:49.179
PAIGE:
Whoa.

01:49.181 --> 01:50.547
Where did this
come from?

01:50.549 --> 01:51.781
It's my proprietary formula.

01:51.783 --> 01:54.250
Now, this non-melting
snow project

01:54.252 --> 01:56.669
could be
a massive windfall.

01:56.670 --> 01:59.087
Imagine every ski resort
using non-melting snow

01:59.090 --> 02:01.356
to cover their mountains
every seven or eight years.

02:01.358 --> 02:03.157
The patent could
be worth billions.

02:03.159 --> 02:05.159
This is snow density test A-1.

02:05.161 --> 02:07.661
Now, on the count of three,
give me a hard shove.

02:07.663 --> 02:09.129
Down a steep, icy ramp?

02:09.131 --> 02:10.296
That would make me
an accessory to homicide.

02:10.298 --> 02:11.664
And ferret-cide.

02:11.666 --> 02:13.832
Or an assistant to
a groundbreaking discovery.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.133
Now think positive.

02:19.438 --> 02:21.504
what the hell

and it's about to go critical.

02:29.211 --> 02:30.811
I'm gonna send you a password

02:30.812 --> 02:32.412
so you can access the
surveillance photos of the...

02:32.414 --> 02:33.646
Don't bother,
I'm already in.

02:35.216 --> 02:36.248
Wow, big tree.

02:36.250 --> 02:38.450
Yeah, that 50-foot pine uprooted

02:38.452 --> 02:40.251
and crushed
the power station wall

02:40.253 --> 02:41.585
like it was made of sugar.

02:41.587 --> 02:43.687
Yeah, the root system on
these pines can't handle

02:43.689 --> 02:45.722
that sort of precipitation;
they just let go.

02:45.724 --> 02:47.156
This rain is killing us.

02:47.158 --> 02:50.259
Augustine DWP
has 58 repair crews,

02:50.261 --> 02:52.127
all working 18-hour shifts,

02:52.129 --> 02:53.695
and we can't get anyone
up to Augustine.

02:53.697 --> 02:56.264
If that transformer
gets flooded and shorts,

02:56.266 --> 02:58.599
100,000 people
lose power on Christmas.

02:58.601 --> 03:00.334
Why us?

03:00.336 --> 03:02.836
We're getting sporadic contact
from the computer system,

03:02.838 --> 03:04.737
so that needs
rebooting or repair,

03:04.739 --> 03:06.572
and we also need
engineering for the roof.

03:06.574 --> 03:08.574
All up your alley, right?

03:08.576 --> 03:10.175
I guess word's gotten around

03:10.177 --> 03:11.609
how good
and professional we are.

03:11.611 --> 03:14.278
Christmas Eve
is triple time.

03:14.280 --> 03:17.314
It's a very important
holiday to me.

03:17.316 --> 03:18.848
We'll be happy to help.

03:18.850 --> 03:20.383
Walter, do you think...

03:20.384 --> 03:21.917
There might be
a chance to show that...

03:21.919 --> 03:23.585
Walter?

03:23.587 --> 03:25.219
(mumbling)

03:25.221 --> 03:26.620
Walter!
Yeah.

03:26.622 --> 03:27.687
Uh, sorry.

03:27.689 --> 03:29.355
Uh, Mr. Woodbury,
once we get there,

03:29.357 --> 03:30.723
we can easily run

03:30.725 --> 03:31.657
a system diagnostic.

03:31.659 --> 03:33.525
Happy, check my engineering.

03:33.527 --> 03:36.694
Now, if we can float a large
enough tarp over the structure,

03:36.696 --> 03:38.162
we can give
it a new roof

03:38.164 --> 03:39.763
and improve the
surrounding drainage

03:39.765 --> 03:41.631
to prevent a mudslide
from this hill.

03:41.633 --> 03:43.633
Why do you think
that hill's in danger?

03:43.635 --> 03:45.234
Uh, surface area of the soil,
volume, porosity.

03:45.236 --> 03:46.702
Standard geomorphology.

03:46.704 --> 03:48.037
Okay, decent engineering,

03:48.038 --> 03:49.371
but where do we get
the big balloons?

03:49.373 --> 03:51.506
Didn't your father used to sell
used cars at his garage?

03:51.508 --> 03:53.425
Yeah.
Then we're covered.

03:53.426 --> 03:55.343
Okay, we will be at
the power station in an hour.

03:55.345 --> 03:57.712
Now, we will need three cars
to gather the equipment.

03:57.714 --> 03:59.413
I'll explain why
on the way.

04:03.552 --> 04:05.852
Second time this morning I've
heard him talking to himself.

04:05.854 --> 04:08.221
Ever since Megan died.

04:08.223 --> 04:09.388
It's getting worse.

04:09.390 --> 04:11.490
I'll ride with him.

04:12.459 --> 04:14.592
(thunder rumbling)

04:16.429 --> 04:19.463
(sighs)

04:19.465 --> 04:21.198
You work with
the world's best mechanic.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.767
You ever think to ask her
to fix this jalopy?

04:23.769 --> 04:24.968
(mouthing)

04:24.970 --> 04:26.536
Something
on your mind?

04:26.538 --> 04:28.271
You're moving your lips
and nothing's coming out.

04:28.273 --> 04:29.572
I'm running ideas, numbers.

04:29.574 --> 04:30.706
What's the big deal?

04:30.708 --> 04:33.208
It's just a new development.

04:33.210 --> 04:34.776
And an odd one.

04:36.980 --> 04:39.780
Can't shut you up today.

04:39.782 --> 04:43.283
Do you at least have something
to dry off my leg?

04:43.285 --> 04:44.317
Don't open that. Please.

04:47.288 --> 04:48.620
Whoa.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.288
What's so important about this?
Don't shake it.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.555
Don't shake that, Toby!

04:51.557 --> 04:53.823
Please, don't, don't.

04:53.825 --> 04:55.624
Oh, God.

04:55.626 --> 04:57.926
I told you not to open it.
But what you didn't say

04:57.928 --> 04:59.460
was that your sister
was in there.

04:59.462 --> 05:01.462
Well, I haven't had
the opportunity to spread them.

05:01.464 --> 05:03.530
So you're keeping them
in the glove compartment,

05:03.532 --> 05:04.697
in a coffee can?

05:04.699 --> 05:06.598
The urn they gave me was black.

05:06.600 --> 05:07.765
Megan hated black.

05:07.767 --> 05:09.500
It's safe in there.

05:09.502 --> 05:11.468
And that's enough on this topic.

05:13.705 --> 05:15.771
(Sylvester humming)

05:18.275 --> 05:20.341
Got a song
in your heart?

05:22.445 --> 05:23.811
I'm just thinking about Megan.

05:23.813 --> 05:25.479
And you smile about it?

05:25.481 --> 05:27.013
Absolutely.

05:27.015 --> 05:29.382
Even close
to the end,

05:29.384 --> 05:30.916
when there was music she wanted,
we listened to it;

05:30.918 --> 05:32.384
a book, I'd read it to her.

05:32.386 --> 05:33.985
We were together
for a short time,

05:33.987 --> 05:37.722
but we didn't waste
any moments, so...

05:37.724 --> 05:39.390
there's nothing to regret.

05:40.359 --> 05:41.858
Why?

05:41.860 --> 05:42.758
What are you thinking about?

05:42.760 --> 05:45.527
Nothing.

05:50.566 --> 05:51.932
Excellent.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.600
Now we have a break in weather.

05:53.602 --> 05:55.602
Okay, let's set up
balloons and tarp.

05:55.604 --> 05:57.470
Helium tank goes over there.

05:57.472 --> 05:59.738
Now I'm gonna go inside and
start a computer diagnostic.

05:59.740 --> 06:00.805
Happy, pick the lock.

06:00.807 --> 06:02.290
We'll float the tarp

06:02.291 --> 06:03.774
over the building
in under an hour.

06:03.776 --> 06:05.609
TOBY (quietly):
You're not gonna believe

06:05.610 --> 06:07.443
what's in his glove compartment.
Gloves?

06:07.446 --> 06:09.379
If it was gloves, do you
think I'd be whispering?

06:09.381 --> 06:11.748
He's got a can of Chock
Full 'O Sister in there.

06:11.750 --> 06:12.782
What?

06:15.386 --> 06:17.452

Okay, so...

07:16.939 --> 07:19.806
once this balloon is inflated,
we can lift everything up,

07:19.808 --> 07:21.374
and the tarp will
cover the building.

07:21.376 --> 07:22.942
All set. Ready to roll.
Sure thing.

07:22.944 --> 07:25.811
Okay, so the computer system
is back to full operation.

07:25.813 --> 07:28.880
Now, one electric transformer
suffered water damage

07:28.882 --> 07:30.982
from the roof rupture,
but I shut it down,

07:30.984 --> 07:32.750
and the backup is compensating.

07:32.752 --> 07:34.818

It's the unexpurgated buildup
of stress and grieving.

His internal monologue
has gone external.

07:39.958 --> 07:41.657
What's going to
get him out of this?

TOBY:
Well, if it was 1940,

07:43.027 --> 07:44.793
shock therapy.

07:44.795 --> 07:46.828
Past that, until he's willing
to deal with Megan's death,

07:46.830 --> 07:47.929
there will be no progress.

07:47.931 --> 07:49.129
He has to want it.

07:52.501 --> 07:54.133
We're back online.

07:54.135 --> 07:55.400
Okay.

07:57.937 --> 07:59.937
Um, can I get
a minute?

07:59.939 --> 08:01.872
I think that
this construction

08:01.874 --> 08:03.807
should protect
the building nicely.

08:03.809 --> 08:05.775
TOBY: Yeah,
it's pretty traditional.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.042
I-I want to ask you
something else.

08:07.044 --> 08:08.576
(loud rumbling)

08:08.578 --> 08:10.678
Earthquake?

08:10.680 --> 08:11.845
No, that was a pressure crack

08:11.847 --> 08:14.047
from concrete
at least 15 feet thick.

08:15.483 --> 08:18.650
I know my concrete.

08:18.652 --> 08:21.051
Isn't there a dam
about a mile away from here?

08:24.556 --> 08:26.122
(vehicle doors closing)

08:26.124 --> 08:27.389
There. Mudslide.

08:27.391 --> 08:28.823
WALTER:
It must have poured

08:28.825 --> 08:30.141
millions of gallons
into that reservoir.

08:30.142 --> 08:31.458
HAPPY: It's well over
the capacity line,

08:31.460 --> 08:32.992
and there's a crack
in the dam face.

08:32.994 --> 08:34.693
Is the dam gonna fail?
SYLVESTER: Is anyone else

08:34.695 --> 08:35.860
thinking about the little town
down in the valley?

08:35.862 --> 08:37.695
TOBY:
It's more like a small city.

08:37.697 --> 08:39.830
Augustine has close to
100,000 people.

08:39.832 --> 08:42.833
We need to get into
that dam's control room now.

08:42.835 --> 08:44.067
Wait, why is no one here?

08:44.069 --> 08:45.535
HAPPY: Most dams aren't
manned full-time,

08:45.537 --> 08:48.104
and most definitely not
on Christmas Eve.

08:50.041 --> 08:51.106
Okay! We're in!

08:53.910 --> 08:56.010
(computer beeping)

08:59.615 --> 09:01.948
The reservoir is
at 110% capacity.

09:01.950 --> 09:03.449
This facility is run
by Augustine DWP.

09:03.451 --> 09:04.783
We need to call our contact
right now.

09:04.785 --> 09:06.584
CABE:
Just got off with him.

09:06.586 --> 09:07.918
Flash floods took out
the only two roads

09:07.920 --> 09:08.952
leading in and out
of the valley.

09:08.954 --> 09:10.453
He can't get his crew up here,

09:10.455 --> 09:11.587
and a chopper couldn't
make it up in the fog.

09:11.589 --> 09:12.821
The town needs
to evacuate.

09:12.823 --> 09:13.955
We need to get word
to the police

09:13.957 --> 09:15.122
and the fire department.
They know.

09:15.124 --> 09:16.556
They're holding back
the information

09:16.558 --> 09:17.757
till they figure out a way

09:17.759 --> 09:18.958
to evac 100,000 people
with no roads.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.726
You've got to be kidding me.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.461
Realistically, there's no
leaving the valley for 24 hours.

09:22.463 --> 09:24.763
(loud rumbling)

09:26.466 --> 09:27.631
Come on, come on.

09:29.601 --> 09:31.100
I haven't seen a crack
that terrifying

09:31.102 --> 09:32.801
since my proctology rotation.

09:32.803 --> 09:34.769
Based on some quick
calculations for water volume

09:34.771 --> 09:36.470
and the structural deficiencies,

09:36.472 --> 09:39.773
I'd say we have 68 minutes
until the dam collapses.

09:39.775 --> 09:42.442
Down there cooking hams
and trimming trees,

09:42.444 --> 09:44.510
they have no idea how much
danger they're in.

10:00.660 --> 10:03.627
Okay, so we have two problems:
the immediate and the eventual.

10:03.629 --> 10:05.028
Immediate-- there's
a current crack in the dam.

10:05.030 --> 10:07.830
We fix it, we buy time
to address the eventual.

10:07.832 --> 10:08.931
The overflow.

10:08.933 --> 10:10.933
Which, given the
tremendous weight from

10:10.935 --> 10:12.534
the extra water volume,
will cause another crack

10:12.536 --> 10:13.568
or topple the dam outright.

10:13.570 --> 10:14.902
Killing 100,000 people.

10:14.904 --> 10:15.903
I think it's insane
not to start an evacuation.

10:15.905 --> 10:16.937
WALTER:
Not without viable roads.

10:16.939 --> 10:18.138
There'll be panic, car wrecks,

10:18.140 --> 10:19.839
and then when we're successful,

10:19.841 --> 10:22.007
we'll know that that is
statistically unnecessary death.

10:22.009 --> 10:23.641
Can you guarantee
we'll be successful?

10:23.643 --> 10:25.743
I can guarantee that we're
the only shot those people have.

10:25.745 --> 10:26.844
Damn it to hell.

10:26.846 --> 10:27.978
Dam puns
at a time like this?

10:27.980 --> 10:29.946
Not intentional.

10:29.948 --> 10:32.081
(Walter mumbling)

10:36.654 --> 10:38.487
Walter, not a good
time for that.

10:38.489 --> 10:40.689
Mimicking nature
might be a possibility.

10:40.691 --> 10:42.207
So, Toby, if there
is a rupture

10:42.208 --> 10:43.724
in the body, a cut,
how would the body respond?

10:43.727 --> 10:44.592
With clotting.

10:44.594 --> 10:46.093
How do you clot water?

10:46.095 --> 10:48.495
By freezing it.
The whole reservoir?

10:48.497 --> 10:50.129
We're in the Southwest,
not the South Pole.

10:50.131 --> 10:52.965
No, an isolated,
endothermic reaction.

10:52.967 --> 10:54.499
Now we freeze just

10:54.501 --> 10:55.867
the water directly
behind the crack,

10:55.869 --> 10:58.002
so it will stop pouring
for long enough

10:58.004 --> 11:01.038
for us to repair the wall
with a quick-drying concrete.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.907
Concrete I can handle.

11:02.908 --> 11:04.775
There's got to be a bag
up here for small repairs.

11:04.777 --> 11:06.042
When I worked for my
grandfather's masonry company

11:06.044 --> 11:07.910
in high school, he used
to add chalk to it

11:07.912 --> 11:09.244
so the concrete
would dry quicker.

11:09.246 --> 11:10.245
HAPPY:
Calcium carbonate.

11:10.247 --> 11:11.246
Smart man.

11:11.248 --> 11:12.631
So we have that covered,

11:12.632 --> 11:14.015
but freezing a section of water
in the reservoir?

11:14.017 --> 11:16.250
The ammonium nitrate for
the non-melting snow.

11:16.252 --> 11:18.852
I never took the last bag
out of Cabe's SUV.

11:18.854 --> 11:20.920
Okay, so we have enough for one
block of ice just one time,

11:20.922 --> 11:22.121
which will
melt quickly.

11:22.123 --> 11:23.689
Okay, we'll get it right
the first time, then.

11:23.691 --> 11:24.690
Let's move.

11:24.692 --> 11:25.724
Hey, hey, a quick question.

11:25.726 --> 11:26.725
How do we get the concrete

11:26.726 --> 11:27.725
through the crack
in the dam face?

11:27.728 --> 11:28.927
There is a winch and a harness

11:28.929 --> 11:30.295
on the dam's walkway
for repairs,

11:30.297 --> 11:31.929
but someone will need
to rappel down.

11:31.931 --> 11:33.630
Down a 200-foot face?

11:33.632 --> 11:34.731
Here's the thing.

11:34.733 --> 11:36.916
I have sciatica.

11:36.917 --> 11:39.100
100,000 people are gonna die
if we don't take care of it.

11:40.637 --> 11:42.737
I got this.

11:42.739 --> 11:45.072
Thank God.

11:45.074 --> 11:48.041
Okay, the concrete
and chalk mix is ready.

11:48.043 --> 11:51.044
About to load the sprayer.

11:51.046 --> 11:52.812
Okay, 40 feet down
inside the crack,

11:52.814 --> 11:55.614
approximately half a liter
of mixture, give or take.

11:55.616 --> 11:57.949
Anything in that skull worth
discussing with actual people?

11:57.951 --> 12:00.284
I'm filling
this section of pipe

12:00.286 --> 12:03.020
with ammonium nitrate
solution.

12:03.022 --> 12:05.989
We'll feed it down on the water
side of the dam to the crack.

12:05.991 --> 12:09.926
Once it's released,
it will freeze a block of ice

12:09.928 --> 12:12.328
inside the dam wall,

12:12.330 --> 12:13.729
approximately 100 square feet,

12:13.731 --> 12:15.864
and it will melt
in about 90 seconds.

12:15.866 --> 12:18.700
I got 90 seconds
to fill that whole rupture?

12:19.736 --> 12:20.835
Okay.

12:20.837 --> 12:21.936
All right, let's move.

12:21.938 --> 12:23.488
WALTER:
I don't think

12:23.489 --> 12:25.039

makes me less efficient.

12:25.041 --> 12:26.974
It's the symptomatology
that's concerning.

It's not making me less
efficient, so please keep

psychoanalysis to yourself,

12:30.946 --> 12:33.813
so that I can focus
on saving the dam.

12:33.815 --> 12:34.947
With the number
of degrees I have,

12:34.949 --> 12:36.014
it's more dollar-store
psychoanalysis.

12:36.016 --> 12:39.017
Just FYI.

What are we looking at?

16:53.427 --> 16:55.393
A problem in the form of a clog.

16:55.395 --> 16:57.928
Debris from the mudslide's
blocking the output pipe.

16:57.930 --> 16:59.362
So the reservoir's not draining.

16:59.364 --> 17:01.364
And if it doesn't drain,
the water builds up,

17:01.366 --> 17:02.965
the pressure builds up--
bye-bye dam.

17:02.967 --> 17:04.833
Capacity's at 110%.

17:04.835 --> 17:06.568

don't survive

17:06.570 --> 17:08.937
over capacity for more
than half an hour,

17:08.939 --> 17:10.972
unless their water level can be
brought down substantially.

19:36.289 --> 19:38.422
Okay, this will help us
steer turns in the pipe

19:38.424 --> 19:40.223
and see where the blockage is.

19:40.225 --> 19:42.391
Okay.

19:42.393 --> 19:44.159
Okay, Sly?

19:44.161 --> 19:46.427
You clocking this?

19:46.429 --> 19:47.511
Crystal clear.

19:47.512 --> 19:48.594
Okay, off Sylvester's
calculations,

19:48.597 --> 19:50.997
we have 26 minutes
until dam failure.

19:50.999 --> 19:53.032
You need to get that rig
in the water now.

19:53.034 --> 19:54.433
Let the procedure begin!

19:56.036 --> 19:58.102
(motor whirring)

20:04.409 --> 20:07.343
Okay, there's a fork in the pipe
coming up. Steer right.

20:07.345 --> 20:09.345
Once we clear
this blockage,

20:09.347 --> 20:12.348
this water's gonna turn
into a raging river.

20:12.350 --> 20:15.484
So we got to get ready
to clear out quick!

20:15.486 --> 20:16.485
Oh, you're about
to hit the clog.

20:18.055 --> 20:20.155
Doc, let 'er rip!

20:20.157 --> 20:21.256
(motor whirring loudly)

20:25.362 --> 20:27.095
So far, so good.

20:28.498 --> 20:31.165
Water's already speeding up!

20:31.167 --> 20:33.033
PAIGE:
And the reservoir is going down.

20:33.035 --> 20:34.734
It's reducing stress on the dam.

20:35.670 --> 20:37.469
Whoa, Nelly!

20:37.471 --> 20:39.137
We are stuck!

20:41.541 --> 20:43.274
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.

20:43.276 --> 20:44.541
Okay. Clarifying the image.

20:46.444 --> 20:48.610
Oh, no.<i> Pinus muricata.</i>

20:48.612 --> 20:51.179
What-what is that,
a fancy word for pine tree?

20:51.181 --> 20:52.380
Uh, this puppy can handle pine!

20:52.382 --> 20:53.898
Toby, hit the throttle!

20:53.899 --> 20:55.415
(motor whirring loudly,
Toby grunts)

20:57.753 --> 21:00.186
Ah, what did I tell ya?

21:02.023 --> 21:03.389
Let go and get out!
Quick!

21:03.391 --> 21:05.457
(grunts)

21:07.360 --> 21:08.459
(grunts)

21:10.196 --> 21:11.495
Happy just got pulled in!

21:11.497 --> 21:12.579
Happy!

21:12.580 --> 21:13.662
Where the hell does
this thing go?!

21:13.665 --> 21:15.498
I'm going after her!

21:15.500 --> 21:16.749
PAIGE: Toby, that goes
straight to the turbine.

21:16.750 --> 21:17.999
You'll both be sucked in
and cut to pieces.

21:18.002 --> 21:19.267
Okay, we only have
one shot to save her.

21:19.269 --> 21:20.819
The pipe she's in curves here.

21:20.820 --> 21:22.370
We can beat her to the drain
and catch her!

21:22.372 --> 21:23.437
CABE:
You're smarter than that!

21:23.439 --> 21:24.922
Trust Walter!

21:24.923 --> 21:26.406
He has been talking
to himself all day.

21:26.408 --> 21:27.507
Would you?

21:27.509 --> 21:29.008
Toby, it's her only shot!

21:29.677 --> 21:31.610
Based on her size
and lung capacity,

21:31.612 --> 21:33.144
she only has 64 seconds.

21:33.146 --> 21:34.578
Okay, okay.

21:36.114 --> 21:37.713
We can make it
and save her in 55.

21:37.715 --> 21:39.581
Here, grab those two sandbags
and follow me!

21:39.583 --> 21:41.516
Okay!

21:42.485 --> 21:44.418
29 seconds
until she drowns.

21:44.420 --> 21:47.020
Okay, we have to wait till
the rig goes through the drain.

21:47.022 --> 21:49.756
Otherwise, we risk it
cutting through the catch

21:49.758 --> 21:51.074
and then Happy slipping
straight through.

21:51.075 --> 21:52.391
Now, if she gets pulled
down that whirlpool,

21:52.393 --> 21:54.426
oh, it's straight
to the turbines.

21:54.428 --> 21:56.194
That's a tight window;
we're talking seconds.

21:56.196 --> 21:57.428
Ready?
Yeah.

21:57.430 --> 21:59.062
Hold on, hold on.

21:59.064 --> 22:00.563
There's the motor.

22:00.565 --> 22:02.264
Wait for it.

22:02.266 --> 22:03.498
It's being sucked
into the whirlpool.

22:05.034 --> 22:07.067
Here she comes. Now!

22:07.069 --> 22:09.069
Okay.
Happy!

22:11.073 --> 22:12.472
Happy, we got you!

22:14.108 --> 22:15.640
My foot's still attached
to the motor!

22:18.745 --> 22:20.611
Help! It's pulling me down!
Come on!

22:20.613 --> 22:22.579
Yeah! I think...

22:22.581 --> 22:23.646
I got you.
Come on!

22:25.549 --> 22:27.582
I can't get out!
It's pulling my leg.

22:29.385 --> 22:30.450
(coughs)

22:33.621 --> 22:35.587
Oh, it's too strong!

22:35.589 --> 22:37.689
Happy! Cabe, get
her other arm!

22:37.691 --> 22:38.690
CABE:
All right, on three!

22:38.692 --> 22:41.592
One, two, three!

22:42.695 --> 22:44.628
(all grunting)

22:45.597 --> 22:47.830
(coughing)

22:49.366 --> 22:51.165
TOBY:
Come on, look at me.

22:52.568 --> 22:54.134
(panting)

22:54.136 --> 22:55.568
Look at me,
look at me.

22:55.570 --> 22:56.569
Hey, hey.

22:56.571 --> 22:57.703
Are you all right?

23:00.674 --> 23:04.208
I'm not really big on
involuntary swimming,

23:04.210 --> 23:05.575
but I'm fine.

23:08.546 --> 23:10.512
PAIGE:
Guys?

23:10.514 --> 23:12.447
The turbines are not fine.

23:12.449 --> 23:14.215
(computer beeping)

23:14.217 --> 23:15.683
What's happening?

23:15.685 --> 23:18.285
Uh... two of the three
turbines broke

23:18.287 --> 23:19.486
when the rig went through.

23:19.488 --> 23:20.887
There's only one left working.

23:20.888 --> 23:22.287
Uh, one turbine doesn't
have enough power

23:22.290 --> 23:23.489
to drain the
reservoir in time.

23:23.491 --> 23:26.325
We have 24 minutes
until dam failure.

23:26.327 --> 23:28.093
Don't even say failure.

23:28.095 --> 23:30.095
The people in that town don't
know what's happening up here.

23:30.097 --> 23:31.429
Dam doesn't care, Paige.

23:31.431 --> 23:32.696
Earlier, while you were
building the rooter,

23:32.698 --> 23:34.464
I went on the city's home page.

23:34.466 --> 23:35.698
This is from yesterday.

23:35.700 --> 23:37.166
Footage of the Christmas parade

23:37.168 --> 23:38.734
in their town square.

23:38.736 --> 23:40.469
Have you been
a good girl this year?

23:40.471 --> 23:41.703
Yes.
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

23:41.705 --> 23:43.237
PAIGE:
This is what's at stake.

23:43.239 --> 23:45.806
Not population statistics--
people.

23:45.808 --> 23:48.742
Individuals, little girls,
parents, grandparents.

23:48.744 --> 23:50.110
It is Christmas, guys.

23:50.112 --> 23:51.611
We cannot let this happen.

23:52.747 --> 23:55.514
Any bright ideas, Walt?

23:55.516 --> 23:57.582
(mumbling)

24:00.820 --> 24:03.587
Hey, Walt, you missed
a rousing speech

24:03.589 --> 24:04.654
while you were
mumbling to yourself.

24:04.656 --> 24:06.255
And the gist of it?

24:06.257 --> 24:08.457
Lots of people need
Walter O'Brien on his "A" game.

24:08.459 --> 24:10.425
So I'm not letting you
talk to yourself anymore.

24:10.427 --> 24:12.226
You're gonna fight your
nature. Talk to me.

24:14.196 --> 24:16.129
You have no idea
how right you are.

24:16.131 --> 24:18.131
This I have often been told.
No, no, no.

24:18.133 --> 24:20.366
The river needs
to fight its nature.

24:20.368 --> 24:21.957
River? What? No, no.

24:21.958 --> 24:23.547
That's not what I meant.
What are you talking about?

24:23.548 --> 24:25.137
The only way to save the dam
and the people in town

24:25.139 --> 24:27.873
is to make the river that feeds
the dam flow in reverse.

24:33.447 --> 24:35.847
Doesn't sound crazy at all.

24:41.420 --> 24:43.820
Okay, explain to me how you
make a river flow backwards.

24:43.822 --> 24:46.622
Two miles upriver,
the Kesselman Reservoir

24:46.624 --> 24:48.824
is stable at 48%.

24:48.826 --> 24:51.359
Now, if we can force 52%

24:51.361 --> 24:53.828
of our reservoir's water
back up into it...

24:53.830 --> 24:55.663
We'll decrease pressure
on this dam just enough

24:55.665 --> 24:57.564
so that failure is
no longer a threat.

24:57.566 --> 24:59.465
You know, Doc always says
you have a god complex,

24:59.467 --> 25:01.333
and I'm starting
to think he's right.

25:01.335 --> 25:02.500
You're not Moses.

25:02.502 --> 25:04.301
How you gonna part this water?

25:04.303 --> 25:05.568
We fight nature.

25:05.570 --> 25:06.769
With a tsunami bomb.

25:06.771 --> 25:09.938
A bomb at a dam
that's about to give?

25:09.940 --> 25:11.623
HAPPY:
During World War Two,

25:11.624 --> 25:13.307
the U.S. developed
these bombs in secret--

25:13.310 --> 25:15.910
tectonic weapons to
create monster waves

25:15.912 --> 25:17.478
to wipe out enemy cities.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.480
Won't the bomb blow out the dam?

25:19.482 --> 25:20.414
Here.

25:20.416 --> 25:22.582
Okay, so...

25:22.584 --> 25:24.784
the dam ends here.

25:24.786 --> 25:28.554
Bedrock starts down here
at a depth of 128 feet.

25:28.556 --> 25:31.256
We drop the bomb here,

25:31.258 --> 25:32.657
using the bedrock

25:32.659 --> 25:35.559
to direct 100%
of the blast force upriver.

25:35.561 --> 25:36.660
Dam safe.

25:36.662 --> 25:38.261
This is nuttier than

25:38.263 --> 25:39.662
George Washington Carver's
lunch box.

25:39.664 --> 25:41.597
Okay, we got to move
theory into practice.

25:41.599 --> 25:44.566
Just under 19 minutes to save
the Whos down in Whoville.

25:44.568 --> 25:45.733
Don't forget about us.

25:45.735 --> 25:47.401
If that dam goes, so do we.

25:47.403 --> 25:49.469
(loud rumbling)

25:54.575 --> 25:55.907
Speaking of which...

25:55.909 --> 25:57.892
HAPPY:
Okay, one thing, Walt.

25:57.893 --> 25:59.876
We cannot reverse the river
without stopping it first.

25:59.879 --> 26:01.678
That's right,
but I have a plan for how.

26:01.680 --> 26:03.279
Reversing the turbine.

26:03.281 --> 26:04.680
That stops it
from draining water out.

26:04.682 --> 26:06.581
You-you said
that was a bad thing.

26:06.583 --> 26:08.683
Reversing it momentarily would
take pressure off the dam wall

26:08.685 --> 26:10.685
and make it easier
for us to create a tsunami.

26:10.687 --> 26:12.470
But we have to move fast.

26:12.471 --> 26:14.254
<i> Now, the road</i>
<i> to the substation</i>

26:14.257 --> 26:15.623
<i>that we repaired is still open.</i>

26:15.625 --> 26:16.991
<i> Paige and I will</i>
<i> head back there</i>

26:16.993 --> 26:19.626
<i> to send maximum power</i>
<i> back to the dam.</i>

26:19.628 --> 26:20.811
<i> In the meantime, you two seal</i>

26:20.812 --> 26:21.995
<i> the cracks in the wall</i>
<i> with concrete,</i>

26:21.997 --> 26:23.696
<i> 'cause if water</i>
<i> kills the computers,</i>

26:23.698 --> 26:26.532
<i> this plan falls apart</i>
<i> and we lose the dam.</i>

26:26.534 --> 26:28.433
<i> Happy and Toby</i>
<i> will build the bomb.</i>

26:28.435 --> 26:30.568
<i> As far as</i>
<i> the explosive substance,</i>

26:30.570 --> 26:32.269
<i> she should be able</i>
<i> to find rubidium</i>

26:32.271 --> 26:34.738
<i> in the dam's</i>
<i> thermoelectric generator.</i>

26:34.740 --> 26:37.307
<i> Rubidium explodes</i>
<i> on contact with water,</i>

26:37.309 --> 26:40.843
<i> so we'll need to keep it dry</i>
<i> as it sinks to the bedrock.</i>

26:40.845 --> 26:43.912
<i> The casing needs to dissolve,</i>
<i> so I'm thinking rock salt.</i>

26:43.914 --> 26:45.980
So, in summary,
we stop the river,

26:45.982 --> 26:48.582
drop the bomb, reverse
the river, save the town.

26:48.584 --> 26:49.583
Easy.

26:49.585 --> 26:51.351
TOBY:
See?

26:51.353 --> 26:53.686
Those are the kind of thoughts
you should only say to yourself.

26:53.688 --> 26:56.922
PAIGE: Walter, look at
all those Christmas lights.

26:56.924 --> 26:58.857
Can we really revert
enough power back to the dam

26:58.859 --> 27:01.726
to save all these people?

27:01.728 --> 27:04.562
No. Those Christmas lights are
gonna kill all those people.

27:04.564 --> 27:06.463
What? You need to get Ralph
on the phone right now.

27:06.465 --> 27:07.464
Get him on the phone.

27:07.466 --> 27:08.665
We're running out of concrete!

27:08.667 --> 27:10.566
Happy, how's that bomb coming?!

27:10.568 --> 27:11.767
Uh, slow and steady.

27:11.769 --> 27:13.401
You do not rush rubidium,

27:13.403 --> 27:16.270
not with all this water around.

27:16.272 --> 27:18.572
Now, we need
to turn it to paste.

27:18.574 --> 27:19.573
Okay.

27:19.575 --> 27:21.341
Oh, no, no, da-da-da.

27:21.343 --> 27:23.609
What? You got a faster way
to turn liquid solid?

27:23.611 --> 27:25.410
Considering how explosive it is,
maybe the prudent...

27:25.412 --> 27:27.478
(shrieks)

27:30.950 --> 27:32.649
See? It worked.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.350
We're almost done
building a tsunami bomb.

27:34.352 --> 27:36.050
Th-That's a real thing.
I just said that.

27:39.288 --> 27:40.453
SYLVESTER:
Walt, nine minutes!

27:40.455 --> 27:42.555
We need that power stat!

27:42.557 --> 27:43.956
Almost there.

27:43.957 --> 27:45.356
We should be calling
the police, not Ralph.

27:45.359 --> 27:46.725
They handle
the emergency alert system.

27:46.727 --> 27:48.760
No, if we call them,
it will take a half hour

27:48.762 --> 27:50.428
to convince them that
we're not crackpots.

27:50.430 --> 27:51.629
Ralph, have you
accessed the system?

27:51.631 --> 27:53.464
Almost there.
PAIGE: Uh, by the way,

27:53.466 --> 27:54.465
where's your sitter?

27:54.467 --> 27:55.466
Downstairs on her phone.

27:55.468 --> 27:56.500
I gave her a soda.

27:57.836 --> 27:58.968
I'm in.

27:58.970 --> 27:59.969
WALTER:
Great work, Ralph.

27:59.971 --> 28:01.837
Now send an
emergency alert.

28:01.839 --> 28:03.672
It will go out to
every cell phone,

28:03.674 --> 28:05.707
TV and radio in town.

28:05.709 --> 28:07.675
And be blunt, so they
understand, okay?

28:07.677 --> 28:08.709
No, no, Ralph.

28:08.711 --> 28:10.677
Uh, appeal to
their emotions, okay?

28:10.679 --> 28:11.744
So type these words.

28:11.746 --> 28:13.011
(phone beeping)

28:13.013 --> 28:15.079

Alert System.

28:20.017 --> 28:22.684
"Christmas lights,
appliances, everything--

28:22.686 --> 28:25.887
so we can divert as much power
as possible to the dam."

and loved ones."

28:29.859 --> 28:31.358

28:31.360 --> 28:32.625
That must be Walter.

28:32.627 --> 28:34.793
That kind of language?
That's from Paige.

28:41.835 --> 28:43.434
Oh, no.

28:45.638 --> 28:47.837
Don't tell me Toby's right
about the Christmas spirit.

28:50.741 --> 28:52.941
Yes! Everyone's turning
off their lights!

28:52.943 --> 28:55.343
Sending over the power now!

28:55.345 --> 28:56.944
Okay, while that's
not a miracle,

28:56.946 --> 28:59.746
I will concede that
is miracle-adjacent.

28:59.748 --> 29:01.714
We are super-juiced
over here, Walter.

29:01.716 --> 29:03.515

29:03.517 --> 29:05.650
(computer beeping)

29:05.652 --> 29:07.652
Toby, you have
to throw that bomb.

29:07.654 --> 29:09.353
Doc, you ready?

29:09.355 --> 29:10.721
Damn right I am.

29:13.926 --> 29:16.927
Okay, that's the mark,
and you got to nail it.

29:16.929 --> 29:17.928
Let it fly.

29:17.930 --> 29:20.931
Okay, here goes.

29:20.933 --> 29:22.532
(grunts)

29:24.602 --> 29:26.001
Not good.
Not good.

29:34.144 --> 29:36.844
We are two minutes away
from complete dam failure.

29:36.846 --> 29:38.612
Toby, you sure
you missed that mark?

29:38.614 --> 29:39.779
Well, you saw me box.

29:39.781 --> 29:41.914
How well do you
think I can throw?

29:41.916 --> 29:44.750
If I unintentionally
killed anyone,

29:44.752 --> 29:46.017
I am sorry.

SYLVESTER:
Guys!

29:47.587 --> 29:49.920
Bomb goes off in five, four,

29:49.922 --> 29:52.889
three, two, one!

29:57.895 --> 30:00.762
Wow, we really suck
at making bombs.

30:00.764 --> 30:03.698
Yeah, we also suck at saving
that dam and that whole town.

30:03.700 --> 30:05.833
(explosion)

30:18.580 --> 30:20.479
Looks like your throw
was good enough, Doc.

30:33.758 --> 30:35.157
Uh, what are
the reservoir levels?

30:35.159 --> 30:37.526
Uh, Kesselman is at 82%.

30:37.528 --> 30:40.161
And we are down to 57, 56, 55%!

30:40.163 --> 30:41.562
We are good!

30:41.564 --> 30:42.930
Well, it worked.

30:42.932 --> 30:44.097
Dam structural integrity's
back up in the green.

30:45.967 --> 30:47.099

we're in the clear.

You guys okay?

30:49.536 --> 30:51.536
Yes. Great work, Ralph.

30:51.538 --> 30:52.837
Now, why don't you tell everyone

30:52.839 --> 30:54.572
to turn their Christmas lights
back on?

30:54.574 --> 30:56.974
Your mom seems
to really enjoy them.

30:58.143 --> 30:59.976
Oh.

I know I really don't

31:04.381 --> 31:06.848
get involved in the holidays,
but this is a welcome sight.

31:06.851 --> 31:08.884
Yeah, it is.

31:08.886 --> 31:11.853
Uh, you know what else
would be welcome?

31:11.855 --> 31:13.654
And something
you might find that is,

31:13.656 --> 31:16.590

31:16.592 --> 31:20.527

PAIGE:
You left him

in its upstairs cage.
No, no, no. I didn't.

33:02.610 --> 33:04.209
I brought him down and then
I closed the door. Where is he?

33:04.211 --> 33:05.977
Well, he couldn't have gotten very far.
Okay, I'm gonna

33:05.979 --> 33:07.979

CABE: Pretty sure you were

33:32.999 --> 33:34.649
the last one to touch it.

33:34.650 --> 33:36.300
I closed the cage.
I always close the cage.

33:36.302 --> 33:38.302
Okay. Well, it's okay now,
'cause the ferret is safe.

33:38.304 --> 33:39.336
