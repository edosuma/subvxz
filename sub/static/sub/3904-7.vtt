00:23.148 --> 00:24.116
All quiet today ?

00:24.519 --> 00:25.889
Keepin' it like that, boss.

00:27.944 --> 00:29.128
We rule where we stand.

00:35.119 --> 00:38.317
Police sittin' on all
the corners over these parts.

00:38.577 --> 00:40.560
Likely because
we been droppin' bodies.

00:41.178 --> 00:42.257
Yeah, they do like that.

00:42.773 --> 00:45.247
But you know tomorrow
some other nigger stop a bullet

00:45.248 --> 00:47.703
somewhere else and then they
go stand on a new spot.

00:47.891 --> 00:49.638
Boy Marlo closed up shop.

00:50.705 --> 00:53.748
Word is he wholesaling
his packages for now.

00:54.933 --> 00:56.692
He ain't got no crews
out here at all ?

00:57.162 --> 00:58.779
How 'bout his avenue corners ?

01:00.188 --> 01:01.891
Nigger give up quick, didn't he ?

01:02.713 --> 01:06.795
Damn, I was just beginnin' to respect
the little motherfucker for showin' heart.

01:07.475 --> 01:08.249
A-ight, listen.

01:08.589 --> 01:11.451
When the police roll out,
y'all step in there an' take my corners.

01:11.475 --> 01:12.436
I'm on it, B.

01:13.765 --> 01:15.020
Cheesesteaks from Bill's.

01:15.759 --> 01:17.165
Nah, I did that tuesday, man.

01:17.567 --> 01:18.941
Fuck it then, you pick.

01:29.795 --> 01:31.003
Naw, fuck me.

01:31.884 --> 01:32.340
What ?

01:33.048 --> 01:34.009
Mope in the truck.

01:34.747 --> 01:35.580
What about him ?

01:35.722 --> 01:36.894
I think I locked him up.

01:38.137 --> 01:39.369
Avon whatshisface.

01:39.932 --> 01:41.328
Big player from the projects.

01:41.996 --> 01:44.795
He was the target on that detail
I worked a couple years back

01:44.877 --> 01:46.261
the one I told you about.

01:51.075 --> 01:52.446
Motherfucker's out already.

01:53.359 --> 01:54.426
Why, what'd he pull ?

01:54.473 --> 01:56.936
Six, eight years.
Who the fuck can remember ?

01:57.592 --> 01:58.929
An' he's out in two ?

02:00.677 --> 02:02.155
Maybe I got the years wrong.

02:03.453 --> 02:05.919
Point is guy's an asshole.
Locked him up is all.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.731
Pit beef, from the market.

02:09.989 --> 02:11.749
See ? Now you thinkin' like police.

03:42.898 --> 03:44.427
Back Burners

03:49.414 --> 03:50.352
Change in plan.

03:52.605 --> 03:53.873
Bell you recognize.

03:55.878 --> 03:58.178
Second target is a Marlo Stanfield

03:58.658 --> 04:01.156
who is apparently warring
with Bell for Westside corners.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.895
What about Kintel Williamson ?

04:03.283 --> 04:04.796
That case is on hold for now.

04:05.030 --> 04:05.921
On hold ?

04:06.355 --> 04:09.490
We just managed to I.D. the cell
phones on two of his people.

04:09.619 --> 04:10.601
Be that as it may...

04:10.624 --> 04:11.985
why not take
a few more weeks

04:11.996 --> 04:14.519
and we can put together what
we got on Kintel, you know ?

04:14.541 --> 04:17.802
We send the case to grand jury
and then we start up this Westside case.

04:17.827 --> 04:19.762
Otherwise, we wasted
more than two months...

04:19.798 --> 04:22.837
change of target comes to us from
the Commissioner and the Deputy Ops.

04:22.849 --> 04:24.410
The department is
in a reactive mode

04:24.433 --> 04:26.920
trying to get the murder rate down
by any means necessary.

04:26.942 --> 04:29.383
Kintel was dropping bodies
two months ago.

04:29.465 --> 04:32.691
Today, it's the Westside
that's got the bosses spinning.

04:32.863 --> 04:35.995
Look, I know y'all thought
it was nothin' for me to sit on that roof

04:36.299 --> 04:39.505
day after 90-degree day,
dodgin' swarms of cicadas

04:39.528 --> 04:41.381
and shit, but damn.
This is fucked up.

04:41.917 --> 04:44.193
And all the assets
work I did on Kintel.

04:44.463 --> 04:46.092
His cars, his cash flow...

04:47.500 --> 04:48.695
I just put that in a drawer ?

04:56.906 --> 05:00.132
Some day I wanna work
for a real police department.

05:00.707 --> 05:03.005
Just to see how the fuck
they do it, you know ?

05:07.229 --> 05:07.967
McNulty.

05:09.462 --> 05:10.283
In my office.

05:18.635 --> 05:20.675
Hey, Prez, can you
run something out for me ?

05:20.700 --> 05:21.367
What ?

05:21.614 --> 05:23.724
I need to know
who reed this room

05:23.725 --> 05:25.886
in the downtown Hilton,
thursday before last.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.089
Who rented the room ?

05:27.897 --> 05:30.360
Address, credit card details,
whatever you can pull.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.624
How's it fit with the case ?

05:34.149 --> 05:35.463
Hard to say just yet.

05:38.489 --> 05:39.556
Hey, my man.

05:39.779 --> 05:40.685
I'm done mowin'.

05:41.282 --> 05:46.657
So I figured I'd use this
to edge the weeds around the fence.

05:47.125 --> 05:49.553
- It's gas-powered.
- Means I got to prime it.

05:50.339 --> 05:51.982
You ain't got  school me but once.

05:52.638 --> 05:54.897
Get some water
before you go back out there.

05:57.739 --> 05:59.194
You been goin' hard at it.

05:59.498 --> 06:02.137
You keep showin' up at the spot,
I'll keep puttin' you on.

06:02.161 --> 06:04.459
Good, 'cause I ain't
got nothin' else.

06:05.934 --> 06:08.468
You walked back through
them old doors, didn't you ?

06:10.028 --> 06:10.956
Tried to.

06:12.471 --> 06:13.832
I took you for gone.

06:14.531 --> 06:18.941
Man, parole officers,
employment agencies...

06:19.822 --> 06:22.941
shit, I just felt like I was
an interruption to their lunch break.

06:23.446 --> 06:24.255
No family ?

06:26.345 --> 06:27.834
None besides my grandmother.

06:28.481 --> 06:29.969
She put me up in the basement.

06:30.544 --> 06:32.867
That's plenty to ask
of the old girl right there.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.360
You could use someone to talk
to 'sides your grandmoms.

06:36.759 --> 06:38.741
What about one of them
social worker types ?

06:38.765 --> 06:39.973
I hooked up with one dude.

06:40.630 --> 06:44.105
He was cool, but I wasn't ready.

06:45.255 --> 06:46.579
You look like you ready now.

06:47.254 --> 06:50.268
I mean, you found an ear to bend,
you wouldn't have to talk to me.

06:50.291 --> 06:53.400
Shit, I know you gonna get tired
of lookin' at my ugly-ass grill.

06:55.711 --> 06:57.504
Drink that too fast,
you'll cramp up.

07:03.311 --> 07:04.833
- You're asking ?
- I am.

07:06.147 --> 07:07.090
Lieutenant, I didn't...

07:07.119 --> 07:08.907
Because I got no problem
changing targets

07:08.908 --> 07:10.756
if that's what the bosses
tell me to do.

07:11.812 --> 07:12.869
Unless it's personal.

07:13.362 --> 07:14.687
Like when Kima got shot...

07:15.451 --> 07:17.497
I don't care where
we spend our time and money.

07:17.826 --> 07:21.121
Bell, Williamson, whoever.
It's all just police work to me.

07:21.368 --> 07:24.066
And I understand that people
above my pay-grade have the right

07:24.089 --> 07:25.825
to make decisions
that are theirs to make.

07:25.849 --> 07:26.764
And if they're wrong ?

07:26.805 --> 07:28.999
Then they're wrong
and time will tell, won't it ?

07:30.312 --> 07:32.247
Now, I'm asking you for the truth.

07:33.196 --> 07:35.555
You went to Colvin. Behind my back.

07:35.860 --> 07:37.325
I'da gone to the devil himself.

07:37.806 --> 07:39.519
Which way you were standing,
Lieutenant

07:39.542 --> 07:41.208
had not a fucking
thing to do with it.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.588
You piece of shit.

07:44.326 --> 07:45.946
I did it because it had to be done

07:46.427 --> 07:48.345
just like it had to be
done two years ago

07:48.356 --> 07:49.704
when we were first detailed.

07:50.291 --> 07:52.985
Stringer was the target then,
he's still the target now.

07:57.678 --> 08:00.154
Lieutenant, you know,
as bosses go

08:00.376 --> 08:01.615
you're better than most

08:02.518 --> 08:05.486
and I know you went out of your
way to get me off that boat.

08:06.377 --> 08:07.010
I know that.

08:07.163 --> 08:09.990
But now we're back
on the right man.

08:26.267 --> 08:27.358
Detective McNulty.

08:29.245 --> 08:32.921
When the cuffs go on Stringer,
you need to find a new home.

08:35.071 --> 08:36.571
You're done in this unit.

08:48.945 --> 08:49.614
Count right ?

08:49.683 --> 08:52.006
Yeah, went almost to Richmond
for this here batch.

08:52.322 --> 08:53.413
Yeah, I'm holdin'...

08:54.528 --> 08:56.309
- You did like we say, right ?
- Yeah.

08:56.790 --> 08:57.423
Give him that.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.776
We're gonna need another
60 more in a couple days.

09:01.811 --> 09:02.598
60 more ?!

09:02.797 --> 09:04.969
You know how we do.
So don't be cryin', Bernard.

09:14.616 --> 09:16.060
You musta left something out.

09:16.283 --> 09:19.206
Fuck no. I got the part ones
from every sector, every post.

09:19.241 --> 09:20.554
We're down about two percent.

09:20.613 --> 09:22.511
Now where exactly are we down ?

09:22.674 --> 09:24.398
Larcenies and burglaries are steady

09:24.856 --> 09:26.944
but shootings and agg
assaults are both down.

09:26.956 --> 09:29.982
Drug arrests, too, but I guess
that won't look so good.

09:30.342 --> 09:32.736
I mean, where geographically
are we down ?

09:33.218 --> 09:34.016
In the district ?

09:34.074 --> 09:36.632
Well, the posts near the
designated drug zones are up

09:37.300 --> 09:38.297
almost all of them.

09:38.743 --> 09:41.814
That ain't pretty.
But everywhere else is down.

09:41.988 --> 09:43.971
In some places
as much as four percent.

09:46.681 --> 09:47.902
Bosses are gonna love you.

09:48.256 --> 09:49.875
It's too soon to take any credit.

09:51.388 --> 09:53.054
This might be, whatcha call that

09:53.171 --> 09:54.403
statistical aberration.

09:55.353 --> 09:56.580
You ain't gonna let them know

09:56.592 --> 09:58.551
that your little experiment
might be working ?

09:58.562 --> 09:59.489
Not yet, no.

10:00.815 --> 10:02.620
But I'll tell you
what we are gonna do:

10:02.642 --> 10:03.722
Starting next week

10:03.863 --> 10:05.822
I want you to pull one car
out of service on

10:05.846 --> 10:08.544
the quiet posts in every sector,
all three shifts.

10:09.165 --> 10:10.761
We'll take those nine guys

10:10.855 --> 10:13.349
gonna use 'em and double up
on the high-crime posts.

10:15.530 --> 10:16.728
If we handle less of it

10:17.360 --> 10:19.850
we ought to do better with
the crime we've got, right ?

10:24.728 --> 10:26.359
Can I get two
Trac disposable phones.

10:26.769 --> 10:29.221
They on special. Four for 180 ?

10:29.444 --> 10:30.147
Just the two.

10:40.696 --> 10:42.895
Last show out at Westview is 8:45.

10:42.930 --> 10:45.687
We could make that if we don't
make the whole damn run today.

10:46.761 --> 10:48.840
Seem to me one phone
is as good as the next.

10:48.992 --> 10:52.020
Only a fool drive all over the
world when there ain't no need.

10:52.324 --> 10:54.834
Keep on with that shit an' I'ma
leave your ass in Baltimore.

10:54.857 --> 10:57.086
I don't trust no man
on the road by hisself, okay ?

10:57.110 --> 10:58.154
I'm not stupid.

11:04.323 --> 11:05.226
Stupid ass fucker.

11:05.895 --> 11:06.611
Commissioner !

11:09.203 --> 11:09.800
How goes it ?

11:11.219 --> 11:13.494
It went a lot better before
the Mayor's cabinet meeting

11:13.518 --> 11:14.479
I can tell you that.

11:14.774 --> 11:15.371
He rip you ?

11:16.205 --> 11:19.924
Says we need to finish under 300
for this year regardless of how it happens.

11:20.677 --> 11:22.643
- I tried to tell...
- Erv, lemme ask you...

11:26.226 --> 11:28.983
where do you guys stand on this
witness assistance thing ?

11:29.323 --> 11:29.710
What ?

11:30.473 --> 11:32.944
Overhauling the city's
witness assistance program ?

11:35.033 --> 11:37.286
Nobody from the Mayor's office
called you regarding

11:37.311 --> 11:39.141
this problem of witnesses
getting killed ?

11:40.255 --> 11:42.835
I got a call from the chief
of staff a week ago, yeah.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.201
But all he said was
I should try not to have

11:45.202 --> 11:46.608
any more witnesses get killed.

11:47.243 --> 11:48.696
But overhauling the program ?

11:49.096 --> 11:51.221
Unless someone wants
to spend a lot more money

11:51.222 --> 11:53.424
there's not a whole
helluva lot my people can do.

11:53.494 --> 11:55.841
And you haven't talked
to the Mayor directly on this ?

11:57.921 --> 11:59.528
You're not gonna fuck me on this ?

11:59.798 --> 12:02.178
As it is, I got
the Mayor's teeth in my ass.

12:02.261 --> 12:03.845
Your name does not get mentioned.

12:06.944 --> 12:08.328
Mayor didn't say a word to me.

12:10.651 --> 12:11.097
Thanks.

12:29.617 --> 12:30.906
Where the fuck we at now !?

12:32.982 --> 12:34.400
Just buy four or five, Bernard.

12:34.401 --> 12:36.465
Do it like that
and it'll go twice as quick.

12:37.453 --> 12:40.022
I want a Shrek Slurpee, Bernard.
And some Krispee Kreme.

12:44.684 --> 12:46.866
All this from one disposable
cell phone ?

12:47.029 --> 12:48.402
And a dead one, too.

12:49.715 --> 12:53.315
It was used by Marlo's people
and picked up off the ground by Kima's C.I.

12:53.678 --> 12:55.451
Problem is it's just raw data.

12:55.614 --> 12:58.231
We need to firm up what we know
about Marlo's operation

12:58.265 --> 12:59.966
with surveillance and C.I. info.

13:00.411 --> 13:01.563
On the other hand

13:02.126 --> 13:04.213
if we had a burner
that we knew was used

13:04.237 --> 13:05.833
by one of Stringer's players...

13:06.290 --> 13:08.848
we could use what we know
about that origination to make

13:08.860 --> 13:09.963
all kinds of connections.

13:10.479 --> 13:13.302
Get us one good phone,
we'll give you the network.

13:14.136 --> 13:15.426
That's the good news.

13:15.427 --> 13:16.517
What's the bad ?

13:17.127 --> 13:18.605
It's all historical.

13:19.321 --> 13:21.209
We can give you
the network no problem

13:21.726 --> 13:24.954
but by then it's a week old
and they've dumped their phones.

13:25.435 --> 13:27.430
And how we get a wire up on that...

13:28.087 --> 13:29.670
I haven't figured out yet.

13:30.525 --> 13:32.333
Well, see that you do, detective.

13:43.338 --> 13:46.517
Oh, yeah. You keep this job.
I'ma gain some serious weight.

13:46.974 --> 13:48.475
- Just the two ?
- Just the two.

13:48.992 --> 13:50.998
Nigga, you ain't never
hearda buyin' in bulk ?

13:51.020 --> 13:53.085
You could be savin'
them people all kinda money.

13:53.097 --> 13:54.635
Or better still, spendin' it on me.

14:11.462 --> 14:13.198
Why you got a gun, Bernard ?

14:13.444 --> 14:15.954
You ain't heard ?
Avon's home, so we toolin' up.

14:16.752 --> 14:18.465
You ain't the only one on parole.

14:18.817 --> 14:20.611
Girl, you ridin'
my last good nerve.

14:20.828 --> 14:22.799
That's not the only thing
I can ride.

14:22.834 --> 14:24.466
Just get me back to the Interstate ?

14:25.769 --> 14:27.939
<i>Big white bag,
got the big white bag !</i>

14:29.698 --> 14:30.825
Which one is he, again ?

14:31.459 --> 14:33.346
Broadus, street name of Bodie.

14:33.861 --> 14:35.327
He used to bein the low-rises.

14:35.563 --> 14:37.122
Had a tower later on.

14:42.406 --> 14:44.318
<i>Big white,
got the big white !</i>

14:47.732 --> 14:50.349
How many more minutes you think
he's got on that phone ?

14:54.183 --> 14:55.602
Fuck this, let's hit the bar.

14:56.131 --> 14:57.656
Lester needs a phone, man.

14:57.961 --> 15:00.061
There's an easier way.
I'll show you tomorrow.

15:02.021 --> 15:02.561
C'mon.

15:02.690 --> 15:03.800
<i>Got the big white.</i>

15:04.704 --> 15:05.360
I'm buying.

15:16.463 --> 15:18.810
<i>Big white bag,
got the big white bag !</i>

15:22.437 --> 15:24.361
She just wants
me to be happy, you know ?

15:25.405 --> 15:28.093
An' I mean, I do the same for her,
when I can.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.977
Like this thing
with the police detective ?

15:32.770 --> 15:35.504
Brianna says she wants me
to go downtown with her, and...

15:36.442 --> 15:38.259
I dunno,
hear the man out about Dee...

15:39.667 --> 15:42.988
and I know there ain't nothing to it,
but she's all upset you know.

15:43.718 --> 15:45.512
And I tried to tell her
what you told me

15:46.969 --> 15:50.535
but she says she wants to go down there
and talk to him herself I guess.

15:50.546 --> 15:51.790
You told her about the cop ?

15:52.962 --> 15:53.419
What ?

15:53.548 --> 15:54.686
About the detective.

15:54.851 --> 15:56.411
What you told me, you told her ?

15:56.493 --> 15:57.619
It's her son, right ?

15:58.688 --> 16:00.941
I mean, she got a right
to know what's goin' on.

16:03.241 --> 16:05.242
- Look, I just thought...
- What ?!

16:07.929 --> 16:10.662
Why the fuck you gonna get her
all upset over some bullshit ?

16:11.072 --> 16:13.742
Here we are, fuckin' year later,
everybody forgot about the shit

16:13.753 --> 16:15.736
you go runnin' your
mouth about nothin' at all.

16:15.971 --> 16:16.647
But, String...

16:16.648 --> 16:18.502
What, an' she gonna
believe that shit, too.

16:18.525 --> 16:20.999
What mom is not gonna believe
her son didn't kill hisself ?

16:21.364 --> 16:21.879
String...

16:21.904 --> 16:24.753
How she gonna take to that shit,
go half-crazy with it.

16:26.160 --> 16:27.455
- I just...
- You just what ?

16:28.722 --> 16:29.378
Sorry.

16:48.224 --> 16:49.327
When you tell her that ?

16:49.785 --> 16:51.145
'Bout a week ago, I guess.

16:51.533 --> 16:53.068
When she gonna go see the cop ?

16:54.758 --> 16:56.504
Think she gonna
talk to a lawyer first.

16:56.505 --> 16:58.218
- Ask him how to play it.
- Who Levy ?

16:58.535 --> 16:59.882
I guess, whoever.

17:00.129 --> 17:01.230
- The lawyer.
- Levy ?

17:02.216 --> 17:04.069
- I guess.
- Oh, you didn't ask that ?

17:17.010 --> 17:19.896
And this fucking Royce
just lets it slide.

17:20.477 --> 17:21.627
I mean, I go to him, right ?

17:21.663 --> 17:23.772
Not to make points,
just to do the right thing

17:23.798 --> 17:25.615
what does he do
but blow smoke up my ass.

17:26.729 --> 17:28.664
"I'm glad you came
to us with this, Tommy..."

17:28.687 --> 17:31.434
"Oh, I'll light a fire, don't you worry.
We gotta move on this."

17:33.404 --> 17:36.349
I never thought he'd have the balls
to just fuck the dog on it.

17:36.866 --> 17:38.492
And you were doing the right thing.

17:38.515 --> 17:39.184
Fuck yeah.

17:40.873 --> 17:41.296
What ?

17:42.187 --> 17:44.545
You went there hoping
that Royce would disappoint.

17:44.850 --> 17:47.670
You want to know that you're better,
that you deserve his chair.

17:47.787 --> 17:50.438
If I lie down on this couch,
do you charge by the hour ?

17:51.435 --> 17:52.082
Thanks.

17:53.899 --> 17:54.944
You're not naive.

17:55.459 --> 17:56.339
Neither am I.

17:56.890 --> 18:00.171
A man doesn't run for office
without being a bit self-righteous first.

18:00.206 --> 18:01.463
Self-righteous ?

18:02.566 --> 18:03.094
Me ?

18:03.856 --> 18:05.216
So what are you gonna do now ?

18:06.166 --> 18:07.816
Call a reporter or two,
rip the Mayor.

18:07.841 --> 18:10.068
Maybe on background,
maybe go on the record. I dunno.

18:10.139 --> 18:10.832
Rip him now ?

18:11.523 --> 18:13.013
With the primary next september ?

18:13.693 --> 18:16.581
Tommy, no one's gonna remember
a dead witness a year from now ?

18:17.099 --> 18:18.448
Better if you go to Royce

18:18.928 --> 18:20.946
confront him, not angrily

18:21.451 --> 18:23.981
give him a chance to explain.
Or maybe take action.

18:24.779 --> 18:27.066
If he does do something,
then a problem got fixed

18:27.090 --> 18:28.826
and you can feel
special for helping.

18:29.272 --> 18:31.160
If he doesn't, you sit tight.

18:31.852 --> 18:32.710
I don't know.

18:32.864 --> 18:34.997
Maybe you document
your meeting in a letter

18:35.057 --> 18:36.934
expressing your concern and regret.

18:37.415 --> 18:39.703
Then you're set
if the next witness gets killed.

18:42.377 --> 18:42.998
Win-win.

18:43.731 --> 18:44.892
Unless you're the witness.

18:45.243 --> 18:46.546
I know, you're right.

18:47.461 --> 18:49.434
But he's taking
on a two-term incumbent.

18:50.231 --> 18:51.908
It's all gonna be ugly from here.

19:02.614 --> 19:04.872
Yeah, it's cool.

19:07.733 --> 19:09.306
Need another 30 by monday, a-ight.

19:09.681 --> 19:10.068
A-ight.

19:17.219 --> 19:19.414
Bitch, everything I say
you hear backwards.

19:19.824 --> 19:21.361
Stupid little fucker.

19:24.545 --> 19:27.195
Got them tees, bright white !

19:28.438 --> 19:30.174
One for three, two for five.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.556
<i>Blue Tops, got them Blue Tops !</i>

19:34.105 --> 19:35.299
I got them tees.

19:36.290 --> 19:38.214
Bright white,
one for three, two for five.

19:50.959 --> 19:52.483
I got this, man, five dollar.

19:53.011 --> 19:54.172
- New.
- No thank you, man.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.921
- It's only five dollars.
- No thank you.

19:55.931 --> 19:57.656
Fuck you, man, fuck you.

19:57.691 --> 19:58.430
Fuck you.

20:11.685 --> 20:12.706
I got them, uh...

20:15.662 --> 20:16.541
I got them tees.

20:23.991 --> 20:27.030
<i>Red Tops, Red Tops,
got them Red Tops !</i>

20:30.209 --> 20:32.508
<i>Rockefeller,
got them Rockefeller here !</i>

20:40.963 --> 20:42.829
Hey, seller man, what you got ?

20:44.680 --> 20:46.639
Got the long white tees
for the young ones.

20:46.674 --> 20:49.009
You ain't got candles ?
I'm lookin' to buy candles.

20:49.173 --> 20:51.166
And toilet paper
for the shitbucket, too.

20:52.319 --> 20:53.433
You be back here tomorrow ?

20:53.455 --> 20:55.684
I can't leave.
I leave, somebody grab my stake.

20:57.441 --> 20:58.626
I'll be back tomorrow.

21:24.757 --> 21:26.459
Yo, Johnny.

21:35.542 --> 21:36.244
Was' up, Bubs.

21:41.548 --> 21:42.699
Shit, Johnny, man.

21:44.115 --> 21:46.062
Just been chasin'
that pipe, you know.

21:46.696 --> 21:49.827
Shit got me all diggin'
and scratchin' in my arms.

21:51.199 --> 21:52.219
You know, it's cool.

21:54.070 --> 21:56.227
Alright, come on, man,
you need a break. Alright ?

21:56.333 --> 21:58.174
I'm serious, you need a break.
Come on, man.

21:58.209 --> 21:59.501
Naw, man, look around you.

22:02.081 --> 22:03.665
Soldier's paradise, man.

22:14.530 --> 22:15.786
I'm a viking, Bubs.

22:21.285 --> 22:22.082
You a viking ?

22:38.674 --> 22:39.931
Fuck, not again.

22:42.335 --> 22:43.188
You two coming ?

22:43.247 --> 22:44.830
Major said to get 'em down here

22:44.901 --> 22:46.837
he didn't say shit
'bout playin' nursemaid

22:46.849 --> 22:48.163
to a bunch of goddamn animals.

22:56.575 --> 22:58.942
Watch your back, watch your back.
Watch your back.

23:01.211 --> 23:02.432
Should we cuff 'em, sarge ?

23:02.729 --> 23:03.715
Naw, cut 'em loose.

23:05.373 --> 23:07.525
The fuck we tell you about
fighting down here ?

23:07.993 --> 23:10.734
Only rule is no fighting,
no cutting, no shooting !

23:10.905 --> 23:12.141
An' y'all still fuck it up.

23:12.434 --> 23:16.172
Next time you make me come down here,
see if I don't call for a ten-thirty-eight.

23:16.765 --> 23:19.349
So you know, dickhead,
that's an ambulance.

23:20.428 --> 23:22.619
Break it up,
break it up, break it up.

24:04.141 --> 24:05.454
Did I wake the baby ?

24:05.878 --> 24:07.035
You would know if you did.

24:09.162 --> 24:11.446
It's 3:00 in the morning.
Nice of you to check in.

24:12.544 --> 24:14.061
I went out after work to unwind.

24:14.124 --> 24:15.396
Yeah, you look unwound.

24:18.837 --> 24:19.370
Well...

24:20.496 --> 24:23.297
I figured you had everything
under control on the homefront.

24:23.891 --> 24:25.430
What the fuck is wrong with you ?

24:26.743 --> 24:27.887
What's with the sarcasm ?

24:27.903 --> 24:30.156
How come you can talk
to everybody else but me ?

24:30.938 --> 24:32.158
You really want to know ?

24:33.895 --> 24:34.628
I'm listening.

24:37.397 --> 24:38.397
I miss us.

24:40.385 --> 24:41.870
Do not blame that baby.

24:42.621 --> 24:44.188
Do not do it.

24:44.282 --> 24:45.502
I'm not blamin' anybody.

24:45.580 --> 24:47.552
I didn't do this by myself.

24:47.833 --> 24:49.351
We discussed it, all of it.

24:49.678 --> 24:51.244
We talked about it, yeah.

24:51.933 --> 24:52.480
But...

24:57.443 --> 24:59.604
I didn't have as much
to say about it as you.

25:00.418 --> 25:01.419
And why not ?

25:02.201 --> 25:03.077
Because you...

25:06.020 --> 25:07.301
you wanted this.

25:11.211 --> 25:13.244
I didn't want
to disappoint you on it.

25:19.066 --> 25:22.017
I don't think I could be more
disappointed than I am right now.

25:29.268 --> 25:30.019
You need to go.

26:02.991 --> 26:03.758
Quiet overnight ?

26:03.930 --> 26:06.730
Midnight shift had to toss a crew
that was casing the place.

26:07.685 --> 26:08.702
But other than that...

26:10.690 --> 26:11.925
Too many damn children.

26:14.968 --> 26:17.676
Whaddaya need lookouts and runners for
if the shit is legal ?

26:17.677 --> 26:19.961
A lot of them have been cut
loose by the dealers.

26:20.304 --> 26:22.167
It's like one of those nature shows

26:22.495 --> 26:24.097
where you mess
with the environment

26:24.112 --> 26:26.193
some species gets
fucked out of their habitat.

26:26.209 --> 26:28.383
Did you just use the word
habitat in a sentence ?

26:28.416 --> 26:28.884
I did.

26:38.837 --> 26:40.479
You let your lookouts go ?

26:40.917 --> 26:41.700
My runners, too.

26:41.715 --> 26:43.170
Shit, what's the point ?

26:43.894 --> 26:45.787
So here you are
making money hand over fist

26:45.818 --> 26:48.338
and you're too damn greedy
to take care of your work force.

26:48.339 --> 26:49.075
I don't need 'em.

26:49.793 --> 26:51.077
But they need you, right ?

26:51.656 --> 26:53.908
You was all they had
when you couldn't work a corner

26:53.940 --> 26:55.136
except for touts and runners

26:55.137 --> 26:57.436
then it was cool to have them
cut school and work out.

27:02.132 --> 27:03.805
Okay, new tax initiative,
my brother.

27:04.275 --> 27:04.995
Say what ?

27:05.051 --> 27:07.038
If you wanna sling
in Hamsterdam after today

27:07.054 --> 27:10.262
you an' every other knucklehead
you each gotta kick in a hunnert a week.

27:10.309 --> 27:11.982
Oh, so you tryin' to get paid, huh.

27:12.140 --> 27:14.298
Not me, not for me.

27:16.929 --> 27:18.260
Get the cash up, I'll be back.

27:40.050 --> 27:42.491
But it ain't something I'm gonna
go to jail for, right ?

27:42.523 --> 27:44.509
I mean, it ain't nothing
like that is it ?

27:53.979 --> 27:54.448
That one ?

27:55.151 --> 27:56.783
No, it was more black than silver.

27:57.832 --> 27:58.676
This one, I think.

28:05.399 --> 28:08.151
I can see y'all got some real
ugly shit planned for me.

28:08.497 --> 28:09.372
I can see it.

28:12.674 --> 28:15.834
You just bumped up against
a clever police is all.

28:16.490 --> 28:18.852
Course he's gonna try
to shame you with the dead girl

28:18.884 --> 28:22.672
or some mess about children lookin' up
to Omar an' his sawed-off.

28:23.328 --> 28:24.662
All he can do

28:24.663 --> 28:28.005
especially since you backed down
what he had for a witness.

28:29.060 --> 28:31.297
He workin' you with guilt, boy.

28:32.408 --> 28:35.387
Yeah, but that fat man gave me
an itch I can't scratch, Butchie.

28:35.418 --> 28:38.687
Everybody in this world does
what they gonna do.

28:39.172 --> 28:41.316
Me, you, that police.

28:42.129 --> 28:44.469
Everybody in this world
got their own place.

28:45.751 --> 28:47.945
An' a man in your line of work

28:47.946 --> 28:50.399
start worryin' about how other
people see you

28:51.170 --> 28:54.706
playin' the other people,
instead of to hisself, he gonna get dead.

29:03.228 --> 29:05.153
I still feel like
I owe somethin', Butch.

29:07.735 --> 29:12.210
I had an uncle down Carolina,
he dead now

29:13.337 --> 29:16.094
but I remember he was
grieving real hard

29:16.095 --> 29:19.374
real hard over chasin'
his lady friend away.

29:20.256 --> 29:21.839
So he put himself to punishment.

29:22.636 --> 29:26.141
Took a knife to his little finger
then his ring finger.

29:27.205 --> 29:30.084
With them all bloody on
the table, he pulled up short.

29:31.836 --> 29:33.760
For the rest of his life

29:34.480 --> 29:37.961
I remember him sayin' the bitch
weren't worth more than a pinkie.

29:40.354 --> 29:41.637
But it was too late then.

29:42.544 --> 29:44.265
You can try that
if you have a mind.

29:45.764 --> 29:46.907
I dunno, Butchie.

29:48.268 --> 29:49.800
A little somethin' less dramatical.

29:50.896 --> 29:51.694
Ya feel me ?

29:54.720 --> 29:56.894
You told Brianna she could go
downtown with this ?

29:56.927 --> 29:58.944
D'Angelo's her son,
how was I gonna stop her ?

29:59.977 --> 30:01.275
Look, look there's no harm done

30:01.276 --> 30:03.482
if she just keeps
her mouth shut and just listens.

30:03.497 --> 30:04.748
Naw, naw.
It's fucked up.

30:05.266 --> 30:07.927
There ain't no call messin'
with Brianna with this bullshit.

30:08.210 --> 30:09.055
What can you do ?

30:09.148 --> 30:09.727
I dunno.

30:09.742 --> 30:12.590
File a kinda complaint against
the detective or some shit. I dunno.

30:12.605 --> 30:13.200
Harassment ?

30:13.779 --> 30:16.361
This the same motherfucker
that had Avon's case.

30:16.690 --> 30:19.759
Same motherfucker that's comin' at me
in my print shop talkin' shit.

30:19.775 --> 30:22.435
An' now he's comin' up
at Brianna with this bullshit ?

30:22.716 --> 30:24.549
A complaint's
not going to do anything.

30:25.189 --> 30:26.410
And the fact is

30:26.864 --> 30:29.250
if the cops are saying
her son might not be a suicide

30:29.375 --> 30:31.221
Brianna's gonna
hear this out regardless.

30:33.444 --> 30:35.415
I suppose Avon
should know about it, though.

30:37.715 --> 30:39.035
Yeah, well, I'll handle that.

30:52.842 --> 30:54.501
Not much slinging going on here.

30:54.689 --> 30:56.707
Western boys are sittin'
on the real estate.

31:01.970 --> 31:04.443
Yeah... a-ight, a-ight.
That'll work, too.

31:05.569 --> 31:06.024
A-ight.

31:07.009 --> 31:09.407
Yo, Shamrock says we should
take some of our people down

31:09.408 --> 31:10.801
to Hamsterdam and sell off there.

31:10.989 --> 31:13.742
At least until these knockos
roll up off some of these corners.

31:14.462 --> 31:14.869
C'mon.

31:21.503 --> 31:22.442
Car stop, maybe ?

31:22.725 --> 31:23.553
Why not ?

31:49.438 --> 31:50.861
Not yet, you fuckin' rodent.

32:04.524 --> 32:06.949
You all can't do this, man.
We headin' to Hamsterdam.

32:07.075 --> 32:08.216
You come off that car again

32:08.232 --> 32:10.625
an' you goin' to Bon Secours
emergency room. You hear me ?

32:10.641 --> 32:12.440
Yo, officer,
we got immunity from y'all.

32:12.454 --> 32:13.894
We goin' to the free zone.

32:13.956 --> 32:15.303
What the fuck's the free zone ?

32:16.710 --> 32:17.304
Ho shit.

32:18.306 --> 32:19.244
Packaged for sale.

32:19.260 --> 32:20.041
Hey, straight up.

32:20.074 --> 32:22.389
Why you think we headed
there in the first place ?

32:23.328 --> 32:24.126
Headed where ?

32:24.375 --> 32:25.079
Hamsterdam.

32:25.824 --> 32:26.499
Suck my dick !

32:33.147 --> 32:35.415
Hey, y'all wanna see a wagon !

32:35.524 --> 32:36.251
Fuck y'all !

32:36.298 --> 32:38.598
You just shut the fuck up
and cut this shit out now !

32:48.166 --> 32:49.041
Like you said.

32:50.763 --> 32:51.703
That's your receipt.

32:53.080 --> 32:55.223
Two-forty-four for
the hoop comes back to me

32:55.270 --> 32:57.806
rounding to two
and a half for my gas money.

32:58.761 --> 32:59.715
This repays me.

33:01.295 --> 33:02.406
The rest of this ?

33:02.922 --> 33:04.784
Use it to pay
them hoppers for the week.

33:04.815 --> 33:07.194
Whether you use 'em or not,
you pay this money out.

33:07.792 --> 33:09.608
Shit is like
unemployment insurance.

33:09.780 --> 33:11.485
Every employer got to pay in.

33:11.688 --> 33:13.301
And if I find out anybody holding out

33:13.333 --> 33:16.164
he's out of here and back on the street
gettin' his head busted.

33:16.545 --> 33:19.250
Least y'all can do is look after
your own people a little bit.

33:21.097 --> 33:22.646
What are you a fuckin' communist ?

33:23.053 --> 33:26.229
<i>23 o' four. Need a couple of 10-16s,
to Fayette west of Vincent.</i>

33:26.394 --> 33:28.179
That's right around
the corner from here.

33:28.195 --> 33:29.823
<i>Ten-four, units responding.</i>

33:39.342 --> 33:40.234
The fuck happened ?

33:40.751 --> 33:41.392
Car stop.

33:41.737 --> 33:43.788
I got a g-pack from beneath
the passenger seat.

33:43.803 --> 33:47.307
Yo, we was on our way to Hamsterdam
an' the man say we don't get hassled

33:47.339 --> 33:48.809
comin' in or goin' out.
Was' up ?

33:49.107 --> 33:50.421
What the fuck is Hamsterdam ?

33:50.437 --> 33:51.798
<i>Lyin' ass poh-leece !</i>

33:52.423 --> 33:53.645
I can't let you do this.

33:53.753 --> 33:55.256
Carv, they got a g-pack.

33:55.507 --> 33:57.932
On the way to the free zone, they did.
You know the rules.

33:57.946 --> 34:00.124
Yeah, man, and I was tryin'
to tell these people...

34:00.139 --> 34:00.890
Shut the fuck up.

34:00.929 --> 34:03.823
<i>700 to any unit at the scene
at Fayette and Vincent.</i>

34:03.854 --> 34:04.589
Yeah, boss.

34:05.372 --> 34:06.687
<i>You got a situation there ?</i>

34:07.189 --> 34:08.658
I can't believe this bullshit.

34:08.784 --> 34:10.177
Yeah, bullshit is right.

34:10.208 --> 34:11.664
I told you to shut the fuck up.

34:11.694 --> 34:14.370
Yo, man, y'all gave your fuckin' word.
You know you did, man.

34:14.385 --> 34:15.764
This is so fuckin' bullshit.

34:15.875 --> 34:17.239
Y'all some fuckin' liar'y man.

34:17.255 --> 34:20.009
Carv, will you please tell me
what the fuck is going on here ?

34:21.775 --> 34:23.043
Major said he's on his way.

34:25.829 --> 34:26.531
Carv ?

34:31.288 --> 34:32.149
Oh, man.

34:46.168 --> 34:47.139
Sure that's the one ?

34:47.561 --> 34:49.152
Reesie say that was the one.

34:49.670 --> 34:51.311
Who am I to say different.

34:54.706 --> 34:57.149
Tell him I ain't gonna pay
'til it proves itself though.

34:57.164 --> 34:58.368
I told him that already.

34:59.397 --> 35:00.979
He say 1500 for his trouble.

35:02.121 --> 35:02.622
Damn.

35:04.280 --> 35:05.829
Conscience do cost.

35:27.824 --> 35:28.799
I seen him, Bernard.

35:28.846 --> 35:32.290
You hadn't even gone past the damn door
and he threw all the papers in the trash.

35:32.305 --> 35:33.510
You lyin' now, I can tell.

35:33.619 --> 35:35.481
You is the only one
who gives a fuck.

35:35.513 --> 35:37.531
An' if you hadn't been
the stupidest mothercker

35:37.545 --> 35:39.882
that I ever gone out with,
you'd just would have bought

35:39.897 --> 35:41.477
a whole bunchaf them
things at once.

35:41.493 --> 35:44.045
Only need like six more.
We be done in, like, half an hour.

35:44.106 --> 35:47.738
How 'bout we make one more
stop you get six of them shits

35:47.769 --> 35:50.179
and I suck your dick
for the next 20 minutes.

36:10.451 --> 36:11.030
Gotcha.

36:13.110 --> 36:13.783
Fuck.

36:15.316 --> 36:16.505
Fuck y'all.

36:17.679 --> 36:19.261
Shit. I worked a double, man.

36:20.597 --> 36:22.100
<i>Bunk, line three.</i>

36:27.012 --> 36:28.200
Detective Moreland.

36:28.733 --> 36:30.182
Heard you lookin' for something.

36:35.326 --> 36:37.345
Lemme get some of them
Trac phones activated.

36:37.407 --> 36:38.299
Eight of 'em bitches.

36:49.694 --> 36:50.883
This one for sector two.

36:52.135 --> 36:54.997
Sector one, I'm using the empty
low-rise housing on Winchester.

36:55.450 --> 36:57.032
Sector three, the old Koppers plant.

36:57.281 --> 36:58.643
And it's legal to sell here ?

36:58.938 --> 36:59.629
It's not legal.

37:01.740 --> 37:03.210
We just look the other way is all.

37:03.508 --> 37:04.480
How ? How can you ?

37:04.871 --> 37:06.764
I know it hurts your heads
to think about it

37:06.778 --> 37:08.844
but before you decide
to lose your minds on this

37:08.892 --> 37:11.837
take a moment, ride around to my corners,
my worst drug corners.

37:12.322 --> 37:15.796
Edmondson and Brice.
North and Pulaski. Hollins and Payson.

37:16.485 --> 37:17.189
They're empty.

37:18.190 --> 37:18.925
All of them.

37:20.509 --> 37:22.534
District-wide, my crime
is down five percent.

37:22.886 --> 37:23.951
But do the bosses know ?

37:24.358 --> 37:26.173
No, the bosses
don't know shit about it.

37:26.345 --> 37:29.473
This is just a district commander,
taking an initiative on his own.

37:29.542 --> 37:30.687
Jesus christ !

37:32.766 --> 37:35.159
I knew it was only a matter
of time before I bumped into

37:35.176 --> 37:36.648
somebody from downtown about this.

37:36.664 --> 37:38.994
And I know your natural
impulse is to take what you saw

37:39.026 --> 37:41.045
back downtown with you,
but I gotta ask you...

37:41.076 --> 37:42.120
You legalized drugs ?

37:42.199 --> 37:44.515
Look, this is a tactical deployment.

37:45.797 --> 37:48.144
We just wait for everything
to get settled down here

37:48.160 --> 37:49.975
in these three zones
and then we move.

37:52.117 --> 37:54.261
Look, we make a big show
of lockin' everybody up

37:54.278 --> 37:55.482
and then we shut it down.

38:00.456 --> 38:02.460
I'm sorry I had to
fuck you up on that arrest

38:05.127 --> 38:07.758
and I'm sorry you had to see us
give that runt back the g-pack.

38:07.774 --> 38:08.758
That was ugly, I know.

38:11.028 --> 38:13.504
But I'm just tryin' to save
what's left of my district

38:13.520 --> 38:15.146
anyway I can, if I can.

38:15.805 --> 38:18.308
And the longer I have before
I have to brief the bosses

38:18.339 --> 38:19.497
about this deployment...

38:19.528 --> 38:21.562
We got all we needed
from the car stop, major.

38:21.578 --> 38:22.320
Don't sweat it.

38:25.902 --> 38:27.732
Let me get a word
with my old commander.

38:33.974 --> 38:34.709
I dunno, Major.

38:36.039 --> 38:39.247
Whenever you bust this place up,
they'll go back to their same corners.

38:39.904 --> 38:42.188
Besides, you were never
much on making a big show.

38:46.782 --> 38:49.615
If this doesn't work, Jimmy,
we're back to the usual

38:49.771 --> 38:51.712
and I'm out the door
on a pension anyway.

38:53.622 --> 38:55.108
But, Jimmy, I need more time.

38:56.266 --> 38:59.206
I need to be able to rely on you
and your people to keep this close.

39:02.601 --> 39:03.869
The bosses don't know, huh ?

39:08.618 --> 39:09.650
Fuck the bosses.

39:25.412 --> 39:26.570
You the man who called ?

39:30.471 --> 39:31.144
I did.

39:36.386 --> 39:37.805
You witnessin' or what ?

39:42.594 --> 39:44.048
I'm afraid I'm blind.

39:45.394 --> 39:46.239
Legally.

39:50.902 --> 39:52.451
Something you need to see though.

40:05.724 --> 40:07.116
Glock 40, I believe.

40:15.720 --> 40:18.583
I suppose you ain't going to tell me
who brought this here, right ?

40:18.598 --> 40:19.584
Like I say

40:20.601 --> 40:21.569
I'm blind.

40:24.634 --> 40:26.123
I thought you might know, though.

40:37.260 --> 40:38.465
You tell him for me

40:39.483 --> 40:41.879
I'm hopin' he might need
this in court some day.

40:56.369 --> 40:57.793
Knockos might come back.

40:58.920 --> 40:59.671
They might.

41:00.437 --> 41:03.317
But until they do,
this your corner to hold.

41:03.698 --> 41:05.091
What about Marlo's crew ?

41:05.232 --> 41:08.393
Look, Avon's home,
and you on a Barksdale corner.

41:08.408 --> 41:09.440
Ya feel me ?

41:10.238 --> 41:11.507
Avon ain't here now.

41:11.649 --> 41:12.650
You got muscle.

41:13.120 --> 41:15.131
Don't worry about that, little man.

41:24.827 --> 41:25.234
Hey...

41:27.490 --> 41:29.648
the burner of young Bodie Broadus

41:30.447 --> 41:32.120
it still has minutes left.

41:34.623 --> 41:35.484
Speed dial ?

41:42.279 --> 41:43.048
Caroline.

41:43.705 --> 41:46.255
You wouldn't have an extra room
at your place, would you ?

41:47.673 --> 41:50.426
Jus' for a night or two,
'til I can get my shit together.

41:50.802 --> 41:51.819
Ain't no fixin' it ?

41:53.210 --> 41:54.761
It's fixed pretty good, I think.

41:58.964 --> 41:59.464
Thanks.

42:04.580 --> 42:08.507
Credit card was a business account
listed to a Theresa D'Agostino.

42:08.748 --> 42:09.923
Yeah, that's her.

42:11.455 --> 42:12.535
What kinda business ?

42:12.800 --> 42:15.025
Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee.

42:15.806 --> 42:17.871
Billing on the card goes
to a business address

42:17.872 --> 42:18.952
in northwest Washington.

42:19.927 --> 42:21.836
I called the switchboard
and she's listed.

42:26.468 --> 42:29.958
D'Agostino doesn't sound much
like a west Baltimore name to me.

42:30.494 --> 42:31.135
Me either.

42:36.001 --> 42:38.551
Truth is, I don't know what I want.

42:39.365 --> 42:40.914
I'm know I'm lookin' for somethin'

42:41.414 --> 42:43.625
but I can't even
tell you what it is.

42:45.051 --> 42:46.646
I understand you found work.

42:47.366 --> 42:49.853
Ain't no payroll job, but it'll do.

42:52.685 --> 42:54.015
You ain't here for a job.

42:54.672 --> 42:56.487
Or the G.E.D. program.

42:57.238 --> 42:58.960
So you lookin' to join the church ?

43:02.983 --> 43:04.141
I, um...

43:06.034 --> 43:07.067
I just...

43:09.038 --> 43:11.399
I've had this feelin'
for a long time

43:12.450 --> 43:16.948
and it's like
I'm standing outside myself

43:17.636 --> 43:20.625
watching me do things
I don't wanna do, you know ?

43:22.330 --> 43:24.908
Jus' seein' me like
I'm somebody else

43:25.440 --> 43:27.836
but never ever bein' able
to stop the show.

43:32.438 --> 43:33.266
I'm tired.

43:35.363 --> 43:36.469
It's Cutty, right ?

43:38.550 --> 43:39.363
Naw, man.

43:40.833 --> 43:41.491
Dennis.

43:42.743 --> 43:43.697
She's left, huh ?

43:45.043 --> 43:47.620
I figured that because, ah,
I'm supposed to meet her actually.

43:49.201 --> 43:50.139
Tonight, yeah...

43:52.704 --> 43:53.816
right, exactly.

43:56.131 --> 43:58.153
I was going to pick her up
and take her to that

43:58.185 --> 43:59.172
but I'm running late...

44:00.189 --> 44:02.192
Yeah, yeah, I know...

44:03.788 --> 44:04.774
Where is that exactly ?

44:04.790 --> 44:06.760
I'm not really familiar
with that part of...

44:12.942 --> 44:15.930
Too many damn scheduling
conflicts, unfortunately.

44:16.103 --> 44:18.425
But we have put it
on the agenda for the next meeting

44:18.441 --> 44:20.944
of the coordinating council
on criminal justice.

44:21.852 --> 44:23.510
You're sentencing it to committee ?

44:24.511 --> 44:27.752
Mr. Mayor, we're probably only talking,
like, a few hundred thousand to start.

44:27.768 --> 44:30.397
I'm not saying we should create
new identities for these people

44:30.412 --> 44:32.196
and send 'em to New
Mexico like the feds.

44:32.258 --> 44:34.154
We just need to get them
out of harm's way.

44:34.185 --> 44:35.718
Lemme tell you something,
Councilman.

44:35.733 --> 44:38.104
I can't lay my hands on several
hundred thousand dollars

44:38.135 --> 44:39.449
that is not already spoken for.

44:39.465 --> 44:42.265
- Mr. Mayor, I was not...
- What would you have me do, Councilman ?

44:42.300 --> 44:44.615
Should I divert the money
that's already been budgeted

44:44.631 --> 44:46.931
for snow removal from
the first district this winter ?

44:46.947 --> 44:49.343
How 'bout I reduce trash pickup
to once a week citywide

44:50.557 --> 44:52.985
put the witnesses up
at the Hyatt Inner Harbor ?

44:53.927 --> 44:56.579
I'm not trying to be difficult,
Tommy. Come on...

44:57.670 --> 44:59.874
the city in the
financial situation it's in

45:00.191 --> 45:01.881
very few friends in Annapolis

45:02.808 --> 45:05.062
we've done all we can do
with this matter for now.

45:06.188 --> 45:06.951
Okay, then.

45:10.822 --> 45:11.958
Thanks for your time.

45:12.310 --> 45:12.991
Gentlemen.

45:41.523 --> 45:42.427
Nah, what the fuck.

45:54.250 --> 45:57.007
I dunno, boss. If there weren't
so many fucking kids down here

45:57.018 --> 45:58.074
I might be okay with it.

46:09.016 --> 46:09.836
Baltimore police.

46:10.633 --> 46:11.275
Baltimore ?

46:11.920 --> 46:12.822
Baltimore, Maryland.

46:25.348 --> 46:26.404
Can I get a Jameson's ?

46:26.438 --> 46:27.318
Bushmills, okay ?

46:27.706 --> 46:28.842
That's protestant whiskey.

46:29.687 --> 46:31.014
The price is right, ain't it ?

46:31.271 --> 46:31.845
Make it neat.

47:02.921 --> 47:03.565
Excuse me.

47:11.237 --> 47:11.671
Hey.

47:12.822 --> 47:13.208
Hey.

47:13.983 --> 47:15.084
What are you doing here ?

47:15.452 --> 47:17.200
I was just asking myself
the same thing.

47:17.751 --> 47:19.733
You drive all the way
down here to look at me

47:19.756 --> 47:22.174
from across the room and then leave ?
That's kinda creepy.

47:22.186 --> 47:23.056
You looked occupied.

47:23.138 --> 47:24.662
Him ?
Honey, that's just business.

47:26.234 --> 47:27.548
This ain't my kind of crowd.

47:27.782 --> 47:28.475
Definitely not.

47:28.522 --> 47:30.456
Yeah, well, I made a mistake,
so I'm gonna go.

47:31.864 --> 47:32.720
Four-twenty-eight.

47:34.128 --> 47:35.113
You live in this town.

47:36.193 --> 47:37.296
Why book the room ?

47:37.378 --> 47:38.405
I live across town.

47:38.851 --> 47:41.104
As late as these things go,
that's a D.U.I. away.

47:42.253 --> 47:43.496
Give me two hours, McNulty.

47:44.107 --> 47:45.608
What am I gonna do for two hours ?

47:46.452 --> 47:47.262
Dream on it.

47:53.964 --> 47:54.891
Water's fresh ?

47:56.333 --> 47:57.354
You keepin' them cool ?

48:00.727 --> 48:02.686
You got squeakers nestin' squabs.

48:04.985 --> 48:07.707
Takin' care of the younguns,
I like seein' that.

48:08.352 --> 48:10.747
Yeah, Marlo, he's real loyal.

48:11.833 --> 48:13.300
You can't kick him off that nest.

48:13.710 --> 48:14.332
Good work.

48:15.776 --> 48:16.913
That's really good work.

48:17.675 --> 48:19.118
Police comin' off them corners.

48:20.338 --> 48:20.901
I seen.

48:23.506 --> 48:25.770
I'm gonna keep my name off
the package for a time

48:26.111 --> 48:27.096
keep wholesalin'.

48:28.376 --> 48:29.583
You know, step back a bit.

48:30.767 --> 48:32.304
Barksdale gonna think we weak

48:33.336 --> 48:34.932
not comin' out
to claim what's ours.

48:37.031 --> 48:39.662
The police leave them corners,
he's gonna be back out there.

48:39.719 --> 48:40.624
I know he will.

48:46.354 --> 48:47.139
Your turn, girl.

48:47.795 --> 48:48.980
It's a bout time.

48:49.555 --> 48:50.071
For real.

48:53.130 --> 48:54.186
For starters

48:54.619 --> 48:58.306
its memory holds the last 10 calls
made and received by the user.

48:58.447 --> 49:00.183
That's enough
to give us a signature.

49:00.581 --> 49:01.250
Signature ?

49:01.308 --> 49:03.290
The phone numbers
unique to an individual.

49:03.444 --> 49:06.545
That way we can identify the user
when he switches to another phone.

49:07.847 --> 49:09.923
Sorry, I'm late.
Woke up in the wrong town.

49:12.437 --> 49:14.557
Anyway, we ran the tolls
on those numbers

49:14.686 --> 49:17.407
and we came up with
a rather interesting pattern.

49:17.746 --> 49:18.673
Check this out.

49:18.709 --> 49:21.101
This is the pattern of a clod
communication network.

49:21.125 --> 49:23.608
Something you would expect
from a drug organization.

49:24.054 --> 49:29.418
This particular one so far
involves 15 distinct burners.

49:29.676 --> 49:30.273
15.

49:31.377 --> 49:34.107
And none of them list
subscriber information.

49:34.177 --> 49:34.928
You can do that ?

49:34.951 --> 49:37.180
With these burners,
with this particular company

49:37.215 --> 49:38.987
you don't need
subscriber information.

49:40.089 --> 49:45.471
Our data shows that over 92% of the calls
are made within this network

49:45.647 --> 49:47.934
with the average call
lasting less than a minute.

49:48.286 --> 49:50.713
Again, suggestive
of drug trafficking.

49:51.675 --> 49:55.215
This user here,
he serves as a clearing house.

49:55.275 --> 49:57.622
He receives calls,
and initiates interactions.

49:57.623 --> 49:58.949
He coordinates the show.

49:59.160 --> 50:00.450
Be nice if that was Stringer.

50:01.376 --> 50:04.164
Now this is the best part,
this is something that Prez discovered

50:04.199 --> 50:05.361
when he was playing with it.

50:05.396 --> 50:07.449
It has a speed dial feature.

50:12.151 --> 50:16.422
Meaning, someone took
the time to program the phone.

50:16.575 --> 50:18.956
Hell, that's probably
the only way these corner boys

50:18.967 --> 50:20.234
can remember all the numbers

50:20.305 --> 50:22.838
what with these phones being
dumped every few days or so.

50:23.792 --> 50:26.702
I'll bet all the other phones
in the network are set up the same way.

50:26.725 --> 50:27.760
Well I've heard enough.

50:27.912 --> 50:29.542
We should start writing for the wire.

50:29.659 --> 50:30.562
When can we get up ?

50:30.645 --> 50:31.501
Get up on what ?

50:31.536 --> 50:33.796
They're dumping phones
every couple weeks on average.

50:33.820 --> 50:36.412
By the time you get a wire up
on that, the phones are dead.

50:36.471 --> 50:39.357
The whole network
shuts down simultaneously.

50:42.100 --> 50:43.123
Do we have a plan ?

50:43.321 --> 50:44.400
Not yet we don't.

50:44.893 --> 50:47.532
But for now, if I could get a couple more
of these dead phones

50:47.567 --> 50:50.195
it'll probably help corroborate
the theory for the affidavit.

50:50.313 --> 50:52.690
Kima, maybe you could ask
those western boys to pick up

50:52.737 --> 50:54.922
what they find on the ground
for the next few days.

50:54.977 --> 50:55.633
Yeah, sure.

51:00.473 --> 51:02.901
Damn boy, you smell like sex.

51:03.134 --> 51:05.199
You didn't take a fucking shower ?

51:05.328 --> 51:06.266
Late for work.

51:12.667 --> 51:14.265
You forgot my Newports,
didn't you ?

51:14.277 --> 51:16.458
Aw shit, man. I did, yo.

51:17.103 --> 51:19.543
Lemme do up these chips
an' then I'll go get your cigs.

51:51.703 --> 51:52.172
Fuck.

52:00.677 --> 52:02.811
<i>Three one, shooting
at the number one Mayo.</i>

52:02.975 --> 52:04.748
<i>We're gonna need
some suits down here.</i>

52:05.328 --> 52:07.310
<i>For investigation ? I'm on my way.</i>

52:08.377 --> 52:09.222
<i>Roger, 10 hundred.</i>

52:09.245 --> 52:09.961
Back so soon.

52:10.360 --> 52:13.081
I thought you guys had enough
of our happy district yesterday.

52:13.386 --> 52:14.462
Just need a favor.

52:14.778 --> 52:17.327
Lester wants you to scoop up
any discarded cell phones

52:17.338 --> 52:18.874
you find on Barksdale corners.

52:19.074 --> 52:20.610
You want Barksdale license plates.

52:20.821 --> 52:22.757
- Tag numbers and all ?
- Whatever, sure.

52:23.011 --> 52:25.497
'Cause I saw the big man
riding in a truck the other day.

52:25.521 --> 52:27.374
Missed the tag,
but if I see him again...

52:27.467 --> 52:28.067
Stringer ?

52:28.794 --> 52:30.718
- Naw, the other guy.
- What other guy ?

52:30.999 --> 52:32.385
Big boy, the one we locked up.

52:33.304 --> 52:34.851
- Avon.
- Avon Barksdale ?

52:35.250 --> 52:38.487
Jesus, Herc. He's at Jessup,
down for four or five at least.

52:38.898 --> 52:40.364
What, we all look alike to you ?

52:40.775 --> 52:42.162
If you don't believe me fuck it.

52:42.452 --> 52:43.567
No fuckin' way...

52:44.549 --> 52:46.017
but the fact remains

52:46.345 --> 52:50.125
we would not be returning
this service weapon to this officer

52:50.723 --> 52:53.714
without help from the citizens
of Baltimore as well.

52:54.577 --> 52:58.319
And on that note, I think our Mayor
would like to say a few words.

53:03.770 --> 53:05.084
Thank you, Commissioner Burrell.

53:05.131 --> 53:08.111
I just want to take this opportunity
to commend our department

53:08.134 --> 53:10.504
on successfully resolving this case

53:11.008 --> 53:15.368
and to wish officer Dozerman
a speedy return to duty.

53:18.726 --> 53:19.640
<i>Officer Dozerman</i>

53:20.779 --> 53:22.777
<i>the citizens want you
to have this back</i>

53:24.865 --> 53:28.431
<i>and to thank you for your
service in defense of our city.</i>

53:31.065 --> 53:34.659
<i>and I especially want to thank all
of our concerned residents</i>

53:35.174 --> 53:38.412
<i>who called into the hotline.
We would not be here today...</i>

53:56.242 --> 53:56.992
Lester.

53:57.695 --> 53:59.737
Lieutenant, you gotta see this.

54:11.585 --> 54:12.699
Big joke.
