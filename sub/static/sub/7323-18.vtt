24:00.510 --> 24:03.713

24:14.684 --> 24:16.986
NO, NOTHING ELSE.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.830
THESE ARE DR. BURKE'S
EX-PATIENTS.

24:20.830 --> 24:22.832
BOTH STAB WOUNDS TO THE CHEST,

24:22.832 --> 24:25.935
BOTH PRESENTED AFTER THEIR
INITIAL SURGERIES WITH D.O.E.

24:25.935 --> 24:27.937
NOW HE FIXED BOTH OF THEM
PERCUTANEOUSLY,

24:27.937 --> 24:30.169
WHICH DRASTICALLY REDUCES
THE AMOUNT OF HEPARIN NEEDED.

24:30.169 --> 24:32.942
SO WE COULD AVOID
THE BRAIN REBLEEDING,

24:32.942 --> 24:34.674
AND WE DON'T NEED HYPOTHERMIA,

24:34.674 --> 24:36.676
SO THE BABY WOULD HAVE
A BETTER CHANCE--

24:36.676 --> 24:38.878
CALLIE HAS A CARDIAC CONTUSION,
NOT PENETRATING TRAUMA.

24:38.878 --> 24:41.781
THIS IS DIFFERENT.
YEAH, BUT I READ CASES WHERE
IT WORKED IN BLUNT TRAUMA.

24:41.781 --> 24:44.183
WELL, I HAVE SEEN EVERY
CARDIAC STRUCTURE SHEARED OFF

24:44.183 --> 24:46.786
BY THE WIRE IN THE LOOP
IN THAT PROCEDURE.
DR. BURKE USES A TECHNIQUE

24:46.786 --> 24:49.188
THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE
THE FORMATION OF A LOOP.

24:49.188 --> 24:52.992
BY PLACING AN EXTRA-STIFF WIRE
DEEP INTO THE PULMONARY ARTERY,

24:52.992 --> 24:55.625
WE AVOIDED THAT COMPLICATION.
EVEN IF THAT'S THE CASE,

24:55.625 --> 24:57.967
THERE'S EMBOLIZATION
AND HEMOLYSIS--
WHICH ALL COULD BE AVOIDED

24:57.967 --> 24:59.769
WITH A METICULOUS
DELIVERY TECHNIQUE.

24:59.769 --> 25:01.230
IT'S GENIUS.

25:01.230 --> 25:04.033
(sighs)

25:06.175 --> 25:08.177
NO.

25:08.177 --> 25:09.779
WHAT?

25:09.779 --> 25:12.041
I'M SAYING NO.
IT'S TOO RISKY IN THIS CASE.

25:12.041 --> 25:14.644
THE CHANCES THAT WE COULD
PUNCTURE HER HEART ARE TOO HIGH.

25:14.644 --> 25:17.216
NO, I DID THE SURGERY
WITH BURKE.

25:17.216 --> 25:19.919
I MEAN, HE TAUGHT ME. IF YOU'RE
UNFAMILIAR WITH THE TECHNIQUE,

25:19.919 --> 25:22.792
I CAN SHOW YOU
OPERATIVE REPORTS.

25:22.792 --> 25:25.054
