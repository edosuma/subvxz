00:26.970 --> 00:29.960
<i>- Doctor.</i>
<i>- Right here, Peter.</i>

00:30.130 --> 00:32.250
<i>I've been waiting.</i>
<i>It's going to be okay.</i>

00:32.430 --> 00:36.260
<i>What kind of okay?</i>
<i>Will I see well enough to draw?</i>

00:39.800 --> 00:41.330
<i>We should know in a few days.</i>

00:41.500 --> 00:45.170
<i>Oh, that kind of okay.</i>

00:45.340 --> 00:49.330
<i>Operating on the eye is not</i>
<i>as simple as slicing an apple.</i>

00:49.880 --> 00:53.650
<i>Mm-hm, there's a cartoon</i>
<i>in there somewhere.</i>

01:02.620 --> 01:05.390
<i>Why don't you let me tell</i>
<i>your wife where you are?</i>

01:06.290 --> 01:08.160
<i>You sure you can hear me clearly?</i>

01:08.330 --> 01:09.350
<i>Perfectly.</i>

01:09.530 --> 01:11.360
<i>Then go to hell.</i>

01:20.880 --> 01:23.900
<i>I'm gonna give you a shot</i>
<i>to put you under for a while.</i>

01:24.080 --> 01:25.740
<i>Now turn over.</i>

03:21.630 --> 03:24.830
<i>Sometimes I wonder</i>
<i>how I got into this mess.</i>

03:25.000 --> 03:28.330
<i>Once upon a time,</i>
<i>I was alone and friendless</i>

03:28.500 --> 03:32.070
<i>and wifeless</i>
<i>and childless and dogless.</i>

03:32.240 --> 03:35.940
<i>A terrible state in which</i>
<i>I could do exactly as I wished.</i>

03:36.110 --> 03:41.480
I never had to pick anything up
for days, sometimes weeks.

03:42.950 --> 03:46.890
And in addition
to this almost perfect existence,

03:47.060 --> 03:49.850
which made me the envy
of all my married friends,

03:50.020 --> 03:52.490
there was no one to tell me
it was time for me to get up

03:52.660 --> 03:55.290
and put the coffee on
because I loved her.

03:55.460 --> 03:59.400
It's time to get up, put the coffee on
because you love me.

03:59.570 --> 04:03.030
Well, maybe in your home,
but not in mine.

04:06.040 --> 04:07.840
I was free.

04:08.310 --> 04:09.970
When I got up in the morning,

04:10.150 --> 04:13.710
I could wear whatever color shirt
appealed to me.

04:13.880 --> 04:14.910
If there was one left.

04:15.420 --> 04:20.750
Fortunately, being foresighted...
Good morning, dear.

04:20.920 --> 04:24.790
...I always managed
to keep a few spares.

04:24.960 --> 04:29.730
Uh... Oh, occasionally I would succumb
to animal hungers.

04:29.900 --> 04:31.730
Sometimes with fairly large animals.

04:31.900 --> 04:34.200
But there were never
any complications.

04:34.370 --> 04:39.330
No tears, no goodbyes,
just ships that pass in the night.

04:39.510 --> 04:45.850
Until one day, six months ago,
my life was a model of organization.

04:46.410 --> 04:48.970
Every moment perfectly planned.

04:49.150 --> 04:55.990
Uh, "Attend cocktail party launching
new book, June 16, Plaza Hotel."

04:56.160 --> 04:59.860
June 16 was two days ago.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.130
Oh, that's last year's calendar,
it's today.

05:02.300 --> 05:04.990
Ha, ha, you see
how simple this system was.

05:05.170 --> 05:07.640
"See my doctor, June 6...

05:07.800 --> 05:13.400
See eye doctor June 16, 10 a.m."

05:13.580 --> 05:18.910
It's 30 minutes ago, rehearsal.
I was down to line six.

05:19.080 --> 05:23.480
"E-D-F-C-Z-P."
Edfczp.

05:24.690 --> 05:31.220
Seven.
"F-E-L-O-P-Z-D." Felopzd.

05:31.390 --> 05:32.950
Edfczp. Felopzd.

05:33.130 --> 05:36.220
Oh, heh, they've gotta get up early
in the morning.

05:40.800 --> 05:46.870
- Now read the next line.
- E-D-F-C-Z-P.

05:47.040 --> 05:48.570
Now read the next line.

05:48.740 --> 05:52.480
F... What was it? F-E-L-O-P...

05:52.650 --> 05:55.380
How do you spell "felopzd"
with a Z or an S?

05:55.550 --> 05:58.680
Neither, I changed the chart
since your last visit.

05:59.590 --> 06:03.180
- That's unethical.
- Perhaps it is.

06:03.360 --> 06:06.800
The vision in the eye that you injured
as a child is practically nil.

06:07.660 --> 06:09.600
I know that.

06:09.760 --> 06:14.500
Now, I want you to lean forward

06:14.670 --> 06:18.900
and rest your chin on this.

06:19.070 --> 06:24.310
That's good.
Now focus your eye on the red dot.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.540
On the red... Huh.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.450
There are evidences
of sympathetic ophthalmia

06:30.620 --> 06:32.350
in your good eye.

06:32.990 --> 06:37.020
In all probability if the injured eye
had been removed

06:37.190 --> 06:42.290
after your childhood accident, the
left eye would not now be in danger.

06:42.460 --> 06:44.660
Why wasn't this done?

06:44.830 --> 06:48.290
There was a kind of feeling against
pirates in Columbus, Ohio, at the time.

06:48.470 --> 06:51.530
- You're a humorist, I hear.
- There's been a rumor to that effect.

06:52.910 --> 06:55.600
I have a feeling you're not taking
my diagnosis seriously.

06:55.780 --> 06:58.460
Oh, people have been telling me
what to do about my eyes for years.

06:58.650 --> 07:01.120
I've been told to rub my spine
with a billiard ball

07:01.280 --> 07:03.250
and swallow scrapings
from church bells

07:03.420 --> 07:06.220
and become emotionally involved
with an Apache princess.

07:06.390 --> 07:07.480
None of that'll work, huh?

07:07.660 --> 07:09.450
Yeah, and that'll be $30,
I suppose?

07:09.620 --> 07:12.920
No, much more.
I'm going to put a drop into your eye.

07:13.090 --> 07:14.860
Oh, goodie.

07:15.660 --> 07:17.000
So you did.

07:17.170 --> 07:23.070
Now extend your left arm and focus
your eye on the tip of your index finger.

07:24.440 --> 07:27.600
I'm going to put the tonometer
on your eye.

07:31.210 --> 07:37.210
There are indications of secondary
glaucoma in your good eye.

07:37.390 --> 07:38.590
I see.

07:42.290 --> 07:43.770
I wish you had come
to see me sooner.

07:43.890 --> 07:47.090
Ahh, I wanted to try
the Apache princess first.

07:47.260 --> 07:48.590
Step over here.

07:48.760 --> 07:49.790
Mm-hm.

07:50.700 --> 07:51.820
There's a strong possibility

07:51.970 --> 07:55.130
that eventually there'll have
to be an operation.

07:55.300 --> 08:00.370
I don't mean to pry,
but will an operation work?

08:00.540 --> 08:02.700
There's no way to predict.

08:03.280 --> 08:05.540
And without an operation?

08:09.080 --> 08:12.180
Your sense of the theatrical
is positively nauseating.

08:12.350 --> 08:14.470
I just wanted to make certain
that you got the point.

08:14.590 --> 08:15.790
I did.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.590
Now, just wait out here
until the drops wear off.

08:21.760 --> 08:22.790
Uh-huh.

08:34.710 --> 08:37.080
- What do you think you're doing?
- I don't know. What did I have?

08:37.179 --> 08:38.900
Well, something in the area
of my breast area.

08:39.080 --> 08:40.710
- Oh.
- Can't you see a thing?

08:40.880 --> 08:41.909
Can you?

08:42.080 --> 08:45.950
Not very much, really.
Are you dilated? That's what I am.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.140
I am dilated.

08:47.320 --> 08:49.680
I'm trying to figure out
if that's an indecent proposition.

08:49.860 --> 08:53.660
What good would it do?
Couldn't even find the couch.

09:05.910 --> 09:07.640
Do you have a match?

09:17.620 --> 09:19.110
Hold it.

09:19.690 --> 09:21.350
Here it is.

09:22.290 --> 09:23.620
Thank you.

09:25.060 --> 09:26.930
It's clearly out.

09:28.630 --> 09:31.530
Right, ah, thank you.

09:35.470 --> 09:38.600
- Smog.
- What?

09:38.770 --> 09:42.840
I'm allergic to smog.
What's wrong with your eyes?

09:43.010 --> 09:45.140
Social disease.

09:45.310 --> 09:48.650
- I was trying to be sympathetic.
- Don't.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.920
Why are all men mean,
nasty and all-knowing?

09:53.090 --> 09:54.320
I can't speak for all men.

09:54.490 --> 09:57.950
As for myself, I hate women
who offer unsolicited sympathy.

09:58.130 --> 10:04.220
Dogs who lick your hand only
after dinner and children in general.

10:04.900 --> 10:07.630
There are enough real problems
in this world for you to hate.

10:07.800 --> 10:13.870
Like the war, the bomb, Congress,
garbage, ecology, the Establishment.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.880
I also hate people who use words
like "Establishment" and "ecology."

10:17.040 --> 10:20.780
- Oh, hell, one of those.
- And also "one of those."

10:21.680 --> 10:24.950
You're so dammed smart.
Do you have one sensible solution?

10:25.120 --> 10:27.920
Yes. Oh, yes, I agree
with the lemmings.

10:28.090 --> 10:30.750
- Lemming?
- Lemmings, little creatures like mice.

10:30.930 --> 10:34.160
I once wrote a story about a scientist
who had a conversation with one.

10:34.330 --> 10:35.850
Uh-oh, a writer.

10:36.030 --> 10:38.970
"You seem a reasonable creature,"
he said to the lemming.

10:39.130 --> 10:42.900
"The one thing I don't understand
is why all you lemmings

10:43.070 --> 10:45.400
rush down to the sea
and drown yourselves."

10:46.170 --> 10:47.870
"That's curious," said the lemming,

10:48.040 --> 10:51.210
"The one thing I don't understand
is why you human beings don't."

11:00.250 --> 11:06.220
I also cannot abide females
who overdo everything.

11:06.390 --> 11:08.890
Including hilarity.

11:10.300 --> 11:11.320
Mrs. Kozlenko?

11:11.700 --> 11:12.720
Mm-hm.

11:12.900 --> 11:15.100
- I have your prescription.
- Thank you, heh.

11:15.270 --> 11:19.040
- Who was that terrible man?
- Oh, that's Peter Wilson.

11:19.210 --> 11:20.440
Oh, Peter Wilson.

11:20.610 --> 11:24.200
He draws those awful looking cartoons
of women, children and dogs.

11:24.380 --> 11:27.580
- Hates the whole world.
- So he told me.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.670
I have a feeling he's gonna start
loving it now.

11:29.780 --> 11:30.780
Oh.

11:31.750 --> 11:34.120
I believe he's going blind.

11:40.930 --> 11:43.520
We are now at a literary tea,
a slave market

11:43.700 --> 11:46.170
frequented by my agent,
Howard Mann.

11:46.330 --> 11:49.900
This is where writers are prodded,
examined, bought and sold.

11:50.070 --> 11:53.530
You can find everything at a literary tea
except tea or literacy.

11:53.710 --> 11:57.300
I don't go to the Mayo Clinic anymore,
they all have cold hands.

11:57.480 --> 12:00.080
She's from the Book of the Month Club.
Conservative organization.

12:00.180 --> 12:02.810
Everything he knows about sex
is his mother's fault.

12:02.980 --> 12:06.890
Author of <i>Kiss Me, Kill Me, Buy Me,</i>
<i>Love Me,</i> I think that's the title.

12:07.050 --> 12:09.890
Or possibly it's, uh,
<i>Buy Me, Take Me, Cut Me, Burn Me.</i>

12:10.060 --> 12:13.430
I don't know, but at any rate, you get
the idea, it's a romantic novel, heh.

12:13.590 --> 12:16.720
There's nothing wrong with paranoia
if you don't take it seriously.

12:16.900 --> 12:20.030
Time's come for me
to take my leave.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.930
Nothing Henry Miller has to say
is of the slightest interest to me.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.170
- Peter? Peter?
- Oh, yeah, hi, Howard.

12:26.340 --> 12:28.170
- Goodbye.
- I've been looking for you.

12:28.340 --> 12:29.580
I want you to meet some people.

12:29.710 --> 12:32.070
I don't go to these parties
so that my authors can go home.

12:32.180 --> 12:35.510
All these people are here
to buy books, enchant them.

12:36.080 --> 12:39.750
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my pleasure

12:39.920 --> 12:43.320
to introduce to you the most paranoid
sense of humor in the world today,

12:43.490 --> 12:45.520
- Peter Wilson.
- Nice to have met you.

12:45.690 --> 12:48.190
Uh, his new book,
<i>The War Between Men and Women,</i>

12:48.360 --> 12:50.920
designed to destroy
the American family with a smile,

12:51.100 --> 12:53.530
is the most detestably anti-child,

12:53.700 --> 12:57.540
anti-dog, anti-female
publication in history.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.990
- Stock up for next Mother's Day.
- Nice to have met you.

13:00.170 --> 13:03.370
Uh, Peter, Mr. Bernheimer
of Doubleday.

13:04.350 --> 13:06.340
Mrs. Schenker
of the Literary Society.

13:06.510 --> 13:07.880
And this is Harold Marcus,

13:08.050 --> 13:10.540
the author of <i>Stab Me, Stir Me,</i>
<i>Stun Me, Want Me.</i>

13:10.720 --> 13:13.160
I knew it was something like that.
Heh, nice to have met you.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.780
Why don't you tell us a little bit
about how you work, Peter?

13:16.960 --> 13:20.860
Uh, how you get your inspiration
and where that hidden well is

13:21.030 --> 13:22.890
and all that stuff.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.360
I never drew a man I didn't like.

13:26.530 --> 13:28.200
Now, what in the world
does that mean?

13:28.370 --> 13:29.930
Very little. Nice to have met you.

13:30.100 --> 13:33.340
Frankly, I don't understand
your cartoons at all.

13:33.510 --> 13:35.140
Uh, for example, this one.

13:35.310 --> 13:40.110
"That's my first wife up there
and this is the present Mrs. Harris."

13:40.280 --> 13:42.340
- Mm-hm.
- It doesn't make any sense at all.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.480
What's that woman doing up there
on the bookcase?

13:44.590 --> 13:47.190
It didn't start out as a bookcase,
it started out as a staircase.

13:47.290 --> 13:49.010
But I just don't draw staircases
very well.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.420
Well, you don't draw bookcases
very well, either.

13:51.590 --> 13:53.580
You've noticed that too?

13:53.760 --> 13:56.230
Is that woman up there
alive or dead?

13:56.400 --> 13:58.560
I asked my doctor about that,
he said if she were dead

13:58.670 --> 14:00.340
she couldn't support herself
on all fours.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.860
My taxidermist said you can't stuff a
woman, so I guess she must be alive.

14:02.960 --> 14:03.960
Oh.

14:04.060 --> 14:05.770
Nice to have met you.

14:11.210 --> 14:14.580
I knew she was here
the minute I heard her laugh.

14:15.850 --> 14:21.260
Only I couldn't tell which one she was.
I've never really seen her.

14:24.890 --> 14:27.380
Pete, you old bastard,
how in the hell are you, huh?

14:27.560 --> 14:29.290
- Fine, fine. Thank you.
- Great.

15:05.570 --> 15:07.370
Oh, damn.

15:19.610 --> 15:22.210
- Pig.
- Hmm.

15:47.910 --> 15:49.770
...An anthology...

16:14.540 --> 16:17.230
Burrows, of course, is not...

16:17.810 --> 16:19.240
- Uh, you'll excuse me?
- Sure.

16:19.410 --> 16:21.000
One minute.

16:24.310 --> 16:27.150
- Mr. Wilson?
- Oh, that voice sounds familiar.

16:27.310 --> 16:30.310
Would you be the chest area
that I grabbed this morning?

16:31.250 --> 16:32.250
Yes.

16:32.520 --> 16:36.250
- Uh, can you see through those?
- Well, that depends.

16:36.860 --> 16:40.060
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

16:40.230 --> 16:43.250
- Are you drunk?
- I hope so, heh.

16:43.430 --> 16:45.130
Uh, I work for Doubleday.

16:45.300 --> 16:47.670
Are you in any condition
to talk about your new book?

16:47.840 --> 16:51.330
- The best possible condition.
- I think it's an interesting book.

16:51.510 --> 16:52.530
- Mm-hm.
- Um,

16:52.710 --> 16:55.970
but, uh, I'm curious why do you draw
your women like that?

16:56.140 --> 17:00.240
- Oh, I draw them the way I see them.
- But not all women look like that.

17:00.410 --> 17:02.940
You know, sexless,
shapeless, overbearing.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.920
Yes, I bet you look like that.

17:06.290 --> 17:10.750
- Heh, only to a fifth-rate artist.
- Third rate.

17:10.930 --> 17:12.829
You're also getting very obvious.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.119
Oh, about what?

17:14.300 --> 17:16.890
I recognize the mating dance
when I see it.

17:17.060 --> 17:18.089
Come on, Mr. Wilson,

17:18.270 --> 17:21.030
you know the venom in your drawings
is only a pose.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.690
A pose? I hate women
even when I'm on vacation.

17:23.869 --> 17:28.040
Well, then why is this, uh, man on your
cover bringing the woman a flower?

17:28.980 --> 17:30.210
It's fiction.

17:30.380 --> 17:33.470
Forgive me for taking your time,
Mr. Wilson, all I can say is

17:33.650 --> 17:38.480
no man with a normal sex drive
could draw a woman like that.

17:39.190 --> 17:41.380
Sore loser.

17:42.920 --> 17:45.420
- Well, did you sell her?
- Scratch Doubleday.

17:45.590 --> 17:47.820
- What?
- Howard, tell me,

17:48.000 --> 17:49.620
this is very important.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.630
- Do you find me attractive?
- No.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.730
And I don't find you attractive
either, do I?

17:53.900 --> 17:56.740
- Of course not.
- Well, I knew she was wrong.

18:23.260 --> 18:24.420
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

18:42.480 --> 18:43.780
Mr. Wilson, wait!

18:49.520 --> 18:51.720
Mr. Wilson!

19:03.570 --> 19:05.090
You could get killed.
Let me help you.

19:05.210 --> 19:08.940
- I was doing just fine.
- Do you want me to help you home?

19:09.110 --> 19:12.380
The last thing I need
is a Seeing Eye woman.

19:13.910 --> 19:16.410
- Oh, God.
- Oh, I tried to walk between the poles.

19:16.580 --> 19:18.280
- You're bleeding.
- Ah.

19:18.450 --> 19:22.150
Listen, my apartment's just down
the block. Let me take you there.

19:22.320 --> 19:25.760
- Sight of blood always excites them.
- Come on.

19:28.300 --> 19:31.290
- You all right?
- It still works, heh.

19:34.470 --> 19:38.340
- You're wearing perfume, aren't you?
- Mm-hm, I always wear perfume.

19:40.170 --> 19:44.480
Mother. I'm so glad
you're home. It's David. He's sick.

19:44.650 --> 19:47.170
- What wrong?
- In the bathroom. He ate some pills.

19:47.350 --> 19:48.410
Oh, my God.

19:49.520 --> 19:50.540
Come on, David.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.480
- What did he swallow?
- Some of your pills.

19:52.590 --> 19:53.710
- Aspirin?
- Estrogen.

19:53.890 --> 19:54.980
Jesus Christ.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.760
Put your finger
down your throat, David.

19:56.860 --> 19:59.730
- Well, what is estrogen for?
- Birth control.

19:59.890 --> 20:01.660
- I don't want to...
- Jesus Christ.

20:01.830 --> 20:04.200
- I'm gonna throw up.
- Oh, please, David, come on.

20:04.360 --> 20:06.440
- All right, come on, David.
- I'll call the doctor.

20:06.630 --> 20:09.600
I changed my mind.

20:09.770 --> 20:13.540
Oh, David, you had better throw up
or you'll never have any children.

20:13.710 --> 20:16.770
- You got any aspirin in this house?
- No, he ate those last week.

20:16.940 --> 20:18.880
- Come on, David.
- David, please.

20:19.050 --> 20:21.850
- David, you'll feel much better.
- David. David.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.280
Are you sure
there's no danger, doctor?

20:24.490 --> 20:28.650
I mean, he won't lose his virility
or anything? Six.

20:29.760 --> 20:33.990
- I don't think that's very funny.
- He won't do it. He's too stubborn.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.250
I'll be right there.

20:35.430 --> 20:38.700
Yes, I realize you're trying
to put me at ease. Thank you, doctor.

20:38.870 --> 20:40.510
Mom, what do we do with him?
He wouldn't.

20:40.670 --> 20:43.730
Doctor says he'll be all right.
Put him on my bed.

20:44.540 --> 20:47.570
- How many pills did he eat?
- I don't know. He finished the box.

20:47.740 --> 20:50.220
- How many did you leave?
- It's been so long, I've forgotten.

20:51.350 --> 20:53.640
Oh, Mr. Wilson, my daughters,
Linda, Caroline.

20:53.810 --> 20:57.310
- How do you do?
- How long has it been?

20:58.690 --> 21:02.210
Linda, would you go to the refrigerator
and get some ginger ale, please?

21:02.390 --> 21:04.520
- Caroline, get his pajamas.
- But...

21:04.690 --> 21:05.690
Out.

21:08.130 --> 21:10.100
How long has it been?

21:10.260 --> 21:11.960
Will you please wait
in the other room?

21:12.130 --> 21:13.330
Sorry.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.860
You're gonna live.

21:21.840 --> 21:25.070
What the...?
I didn't know it was occupied.

21:26.150 --> 21:27.170
Is this all right?

21:43.500 --> 21:45.230
I'm sorry.

21:47.700 --> 21:51.800
That's my father.
He's in Africa photographing a war.

21:52.470 --> 21:55.240
He's wonderful
and we miss him very much.

21:55.740 --> 21:58.080
Even if mother did divorce him.

21:59.110 --> 22:03.310
Well, I'm not gonna take sides.
I'm just passing through.

22:04.420 --> 22:07.790
It's been nice talking to you. Bye.

22:09.660 --> 22:10.890
Goodbye.

22:11.430 --> 22:16.630
He's asleep already.
He thrives on the strangest diet.

22:18.700 --> 22:22.190
- Is Mr. Wilson all right?
- He's not bad.

22:22.370 --> 22:24.250
I mean, I've practically ignored him,
poor man.

22:24.400 --> 22:29.470
Broke his glasses, probably his nose.
I may have to see him home.

22:31.880 --> 22:33.780
- Let go of that!
- Stop, stop!

22:33.950 --> 22:37.280
- Stop it! Stop that!
- Let go!

22:37.450 --> 22:40.580
- Evelyn, come here.
- Stop it, that dog is pregnant!

22:40.750 --> 22:44.160
It couldn't have been love,
she must have been raped.

22:44.320 --> 22:46.350
It's been a pleasure. Good night.

22:47.090 --> 22:49.960
- Do you feel well enough to go home?
- No.

22:50.130 --> 22:56.070
But I'm in no condition to stay here.
Goodbye. Thank you very, very much.

22:56.240 --> 22:58.210
- For what?
- The inspiration

22:58.370 --> 23:01.540
for a half a dozen cartoons.

23:07.310 --> 23:09.110
Good dog.

23:10.580 --> 23:12.450
<i>Good dog, indeed.</i>

23:12.620 --> 23:14.710
<i>One thing I did not need</i>
<i>in my life was a woman</i>

23:14.890 --> 23:19.020
<i>with one snarling hound</i>
<i>and three snarling children.</i>

23:19.190 --> 23:23.690
<i>It was unlikely she'd choose between</i>
<i>us, so I put them all out of my mind.</i>

23:23.860 --> 23:25.630
<i>Until she sent me a flower.</i>

23:27.170 --> 23:29.800
- Are you Mrs. Kozlenko?
- Yes.

23:29.970 --> 23:33.530
Well, some nut wanted us
to deliver this to you.

23:39.950 --> 23:42.920
<i>Well, maybe I sent one to her,</i>
<i>it really isn't important.</i>

23:43.080 --> 23:46.850
<i>The result: Dinner at my place.</i>

23:50.190 --> 23:53.250
<i>Somehow I knew she'd come alone.</i>

23:54.090 --> 23:56.220
- Where are the children?
- I killed them.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.560
All three kids?

24:03.540 --> 24:07.500
Wasn't easy, but I did it, darling.

24:08.810 --> 24:13.080
For you, for you.
It's all for you.

24:13.650 --> 24:16.880
Dom Perignon '61?

24:20.350 --> 24:21.850
My sweet... Ow!

24:22.020 --> 24:24.390
Oh, sorry, thorns.

24:25.260 --> 24:26.350
What about the dog?

24:26.530 --> 24:31.330
I didn't have to do a thing,
she choked on her doggie ration.

24:38.070 --> 24:40.910
Did you ever have one of those days
when everything seemed to go right?

24:41.040 --> 24:44.440
- Ever?
- Feeling one of those days right now.

24:44.610 --> 24:46.840
I'm so warm.

24:47.680 --> 24:51.310
And you are such an exquisite beast.

24:52.150 --> 24:54.350
Oh, my God.

25:04.430 --> 25:06.960
It can't be 8:00 already.

25:14.210 --> 25:15.610
Coming.

25:21.480 --> 25:24.610
Coming. Come in.

25:24.790 --> 25:27.980
- Am I too early?
- No, no, not at all. Come right on in.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.090
The place always looks like this.

25:30.260 --> 25:33.090
- It was for tonight, wasn't it?
- Yes, yes, certainly, yeah.

25:33.260 --> 25:35.230
- Where are you taking me?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.860
Come on down here
and, uh, make yourself comfortable.

25:38.030 --> 25:42.660
I got a little wine for us,
if I can find it.

25:44.070 --> 25:45.070
Ah.

25:46.540 --> 25:50.880
What's the matter with you,
uh, aren't you happy to see me?

25:51.040 --> 25:53.810
Well, that all depends.
Do you have a dagger with you, heh?

25:54.550 --> 25:55.880
No, should I?

25:56.050 --> 25:59.140
I bet she isn't gonna take
her clothes off either.

26:06.330 --> 26:12.230
Uh, it's the telephone.
Hang on, I got it, I got it.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.580
I'm sorry, who?

26:24.710 --> 26:26.540
Your mother?

26:27.510 --> 26:31.040
- Is that for me?
- Are there any other mothers in there?

26:33.820 --> 26:38.690
Hello? What? Caroline?
I can't hear you.

26:38.860 --> 26:41.760
- You gave my number to your kids?
- In case of an emergency.

26:41.930 --> 26:43.370
What did you think
was gonna happen?

26:43.530 --> 26:44.860
- Exactly what happened.
- Oh.

26:45.030 --> 26:48.630
Uh, yes, dear. I'm all right.

26:48.800 --> 26:51.600
- What time, 4 a.m.?
- Oh, my God.

26:51.770 --> 26:56.110
Well, we just got to talking
and time just flew.

26:56.280 --> 26:57.320
I know she doesn't buy me.

26:57.480 --> 26:59.040
Doesn't sound convincing to me,
either.

26:59.180 --> 27:00.200
Yes, I'm all right.

27:00.380 --> 27:05.220
Now go back to sleep
and I'll be right home. Goodbye.

27:09.720 --> 27:11.620
Where are the rest of my things?

27:11.790 --> 27:14.960
To the best of my recollection,
under the piano,

27:15.130 --> 27:18.720
- Oh, God.
- on the chair behind the couch.

27:22.240 --> 27:24.730
I'll never explain this to the children.

27:25.440 --> 27:28.370
Well, do you have to explain
everything to the children?

27:31.280 --> 27:33.800
Your taste runs to the prehistoric.

27:35.580 --> 27:36.810
My mother was visiting.

27:38.420 --> 27:40.250
I do her laundry.

27:40.420 --> 27:43.480
I want you to know I've never done
anything like this before.

27:44.190 --> 27:46.060
I want you to know I have.

27:47.890 --> 27:50.300
- Can I tell you something honestly?
- What?

27:51.160 --> 27:53.070
I enjoyed it.

27:53.230 --> 27:56.260
Before I got sick to my stomach
on the 98-cent wine,

27:56.440 --> 27:58.300
I enjoyed it very much.

27:58.470 --> 27:59.990
I'll be honest with you too,
so did I.

28:01.140 --> 28:06.910
But please remember, I'm a mother
and we can't continue this way.

28:07.080 --> 28:11.980
So unless you honestly think we can
be serious about each other,

28:12.150 --> 28:15.780
the kindest thing you could do
is to show me to the door forever.

28:16.390 --> 28:20.420
Oh, wait, heh. I just...

28:40.550 --> 28:42.240
Well, wouldn't you?

28:47.750 --> 28:50.550
You're getting in over your head.
These pictures are pure pornography.

28:50.660 --> 28:53.130
Don't be ridiculous, I don't draw
well enough for pornography.

28:53.230 --> 28:54.290
Yeah, you're beginning to.

28:54.460 --> 28:56.540
I used to laugh at your drawings,
now I get excited.

28:56.640 --> 28:59.590
Your women shouldn't have blood and
they certainly shouldn't have breasts.

28:59.700 --> 29:01.930
- Why not?
- Go back to your own territory.

29:02.100 --> 29:04.160
You know, pure unadulterated acid.

29:04.340 --> 29:07.540
And women who look like old luggage,
that's what sells.

29:07.710 --> 29:09.270
Some women
don't look like old luggage.

29:09.440 --> 29:10.810
They're round and they're pretty.

29:10.980 --> 29:13.910
Yeah, well, then you photograph them
naked, you don't bother drawing.

29:14.080 --> 29:17.070
I am worried about you.
All the poison's gone from your soul.

29:17.250 --> 29:19.740
I have not been able to sell
one of your drawings in a month.

29:19.920 --> 29:21.410
I wanted to speak to you about that.

29:21.590 --> 29:24.850
And what happened to the new book,
huh? It should be ready by now.

29:25.030 --> 29:27.120
I haven't been able
to keep my mind on it.

29:27.590 --> 29:30.950
Well, remember, it's all right for you to
starve, it's good for the creative juices.

29:31.060 --> 29:33.260
But I cannot sell
on an empty stomach.

29:34.800 --> 29:36.480
You gonna leave me alone?
Where you going?

29:37.200 --> 29:40.660
Out to a dirty movie.
You've turned me on.

29:53.220 --> 29:55.050
Hey, what is this?

29:55.220 --> 29:57.710
What do you think you're doing?
What...?

29:58.830 --> 30:01.160
Now, listen, you can't make
a personal issue out of this.

30:01.330 --> 30:03.230
That's very unprofessional.

30:03.400 --> 30:07.390
<i>Battle Album.</i>
Who is Stephen Kozlenko?

30:07.570 --> 30:09.800
My ex-husband.

30:10.140 --> 30:11.140
Oh.

30:12.040 --> 30:15.100
Photographed your marriage,
did he, huh? All of it?

30:15.640 --> 30:20.310
His pictures at least attack worthwhile
targets, not dogs, women and children.

30:21.550 --> 30:23.470
It's amazing what you can do
with an Instamatic.

30:23.580 --> 30:24.950
Why remove my book for this?

30:25.120 --> 30:27.820
Your book is going where it belongs,
on the bargain shelf.

30:27.990 --> 30:30.390
- This one deserves a boost.
- Why?

30:30.560 --> 30:33.220
Because Steven is one of our great
photographic essayists.

30:33.390 --> 30:37.090
And besides, he's late on his alimony.
Now, what can I do for you?

30:37.260 --> 30:42.220
Uh... I've been thinking about us,
seriously.

30:43.400 --> 30:44.560
I've missed you.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.980
Push my book,
I'll take you to the opera.

31:15.470 --> 31:18.770
What are you spraying
in your mouth? Kissable?

31:18.940 --> 31:21.810
Ha, ha. Hi there, sunshine.
Is your mother ready for the opera?

31:21.980 --> 31:25.880
Because I'm afraid
that we're running a little late.

31:26.050 --> 31:29.950
- What...? And what's going...?
- Oh, Peter. Oh, this is awful.

31:30.120 --> 31:32.380
I'm afraid we won't be able
to make the opera.

31:32.550 --> 31:35.150
- Evelyn decided to have puppies.
- Three of them.

31:35.320 --> 31:37.120
Boom, boom, boom.

31:37.290 --> 31:38.520
I wish I could do that.

31:38.690 --> 31:41.160
Should of thought of that
before you ate those pills, heh.

31:42.030 --> 31:45.900
- Am I wearing my curlers?
- I hope so. I hate to think that's you.

31:46.570 --> 31:47.570
God.

31:47.800 --> 31:48.830
- Mom?
- Yes, dear?

31:49.000 --> 31:50.530
You don't have to go out.

31:50.700 --> 31:54.540
That's true. That's true. Why don't
we spend a quiet evening here?

31:56.110 --> 31:58.010
- How?
- That's true too.

31:58.180 --> 31:59.240
Yeah, heh.

31:59.410 --> 32:01.400
- Is this doll for me?
- Yes.

32:01.580 --> 32:04.380
Marvelous.
I haven't had a doll for years.

32:04.550 --> 32:07.750
Oh, sweetie, that's not nice.
Say thank you to Mr...

32:07.920 --> 32:09.980
- Oh, that's...
- What is your last name?

32:10.690 --> 32:12.990
- Wilson.
- Right.

32:13.160 --> 32:17.460
I mean, I knew it was something
like that. That's, uh...

32:17.630 --> 32:21.120
Well, I better get cleaned up
before I louse things up completely.

32:21.300 --> 32:24.100
She's having another one,
boom, boom, boom.

32:24.270 --> 32:28.640
- Who was the father?
- We don't know his last name either.

32:37.250 --> 32:39.850
Listen, uh, are you sure it's all right
for her to be out?

32:40.020 --> 32:41.720
Thirty minutes ago,
she had quadruplets.

32:41.890 --> 32:43.150
Oh, you know modern medicine.

32:43.320 --> 32:47.320
Get the mothers back on their feet
before they get used to luxury.

32:47.490 --> 32:48.860
- Well, I, uh...
- Excuse me.

32:49.030 --> 32:54.260
Uh, are you, uh, seeing better or worse
since your visit to Dr. Harris?

32:54.430 --> 32:56.370
Look, uh, stop worrying.

32:56.540 --> 32:59.230
I'm perfectly able to fend
for myself under any...

33:04.240 --> 33:09.310
I'm lying, I've been fending very badly
ever since the other night.

33:10.120 --> 33:11.520
Me too.

33:11.890 --> 33:14.650
I didn't wanna go to the opera,
I hate it.

33:14.820 --> 33:19.690
- Oh, I hate it too. All that yelling and...
- I'm gonna propose.

33:19.860 --> 33:21.620
My darling, my God, I...

33:21.790 --> 33:25.130
I'm gonna propose that we sleep
together on a regular basis.

33:26.100 --> 33:28.830
We want each other, we need
each other, and we're old enough

33:29.000 --> 33:33.500
to know exactly what we're doing and...
So we could meet at my place

33:33.670 --> 33:36.670
when the spirit moves us
without making stupid excuses.

33:36.840 --> 33:41.750
Just two honest human beings,
honestly enjoying each other.

33:41.920 --> 33:44.650
No strings, no false promises.

33:46.250 --> 33:50.160
- That's a proposal?
- Just think it over.

33:50.320 --> 33:51.690
I've thought it over.

33:52.490 --> 33:57.400
Terry, wait, wait. Terry, wait, wait.

33:57.560 --> 34:00.830
I don't... Look,
I don't know how to do these things.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.440
- Other guys do it all the time.
- Not with me.

34:04.600 --> 34:06.040
Look, please.

34:07.540 --> 34:09.739
- I'm lonesome without you.
- Oh.

34:10.540 --> 34:14.239
But then I think about having
a woman and children

34:14.409 --> 34:18.719
and dogs around me all the time
and, uh, lonesome seems attractive.

34:24.360 --> 34:28.989
Now you've got me laughing,
but I made up my mind to cry.

34:29.159 --> 34:34.290
You are so terrible
that I'm actually feeling sorry for you.

34:35.670 --> 34:37.760
My God,
we're in the middle of the street.

34:37.940 --> 34:39.570
Let's get out of here.

34:39.739 --> 34:45.300
Evelyn, Evelyn. Peter,
she's having another puppy.

34:45.480 --> 34:48.040
Oh, boy. Oh, God.
Are you all right?

34:54.150 --> 34:56.590
Evelyn, let's go.

34:56.760 --> 34:58.590
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

34:58.760 --> 35:01.320
I'm sorry, officer. She's in labor.

35:02.900 --> 35:05.220
Well, don't leave her lying here
in the middle of traffic.

35:05.370 --> 35:07.200
Pull her over to the gutter.

35:07.800 --> 35:09.830
And take that damn dog
with you too.

35:10.640 --> 35:11.830
All right, move it along!

35:12.010 --> 35:13.370
Peter, keep the puppy warm.

35:13.540 --> 35:17.340
Get him off the pavement.
Hide him in your clothes.

35:19.780 --> 35:21.440
Wait a minute, I lost my glasses.

35:21.610 --> 35:23.880
Never mind your glasses, just...

35:24.050 --> 35:25.750
Hold on to the baby.

35:27.890 --> 35:31.120
Shh, the children are asleep.

35:32.060 --> 35:34.550
I'm sorry to say,
your pants are torn.

35:34.730 --> 35:37.720
Yeah, well, it was a difficult delivery.

35:44.470 --> 35:45.960
Give him to me.

35:46.140 --> 35:47.140
Oh.

35:47.770 --> 35:49.740
There you go.

35:50.280 --> 35:51.280
Oh.

35:52.310 --> 35:54.080
You can't go home like this.
You're a mess.

35:54.250 --> 35:55.250
Oh.

35:56.280 --> 35:59.780
Why don't you take a shower
and get cleaned up? This way.

35:59.950 --> 36:02.720
- And I'll sew up your pants.
- You want me to take off my pants?

36:02.890 --> 36:05.790
Peter, there's nothing more pathetic
than a near-sighted sex maniac.

36:05.960 --> 36:08.290
Except a middle-aged one.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.290
Whistle so I'll know where you are.

36:15.700 --> 36:17.190
- There you are.
- Heh.

36:20.370 --> 36:23.040
This was an absolutely
ridiculous situation.

36:23.210 --> 36:25.610
Most of life, I've found,
consists of ridiculous situations.

36:25.710 --> 36:28.440
The most ridiculous thing about it
is that I'm in love with you.

36:28.610 --> 36:29.610
Aw.

36:30.880 --> 36:33.790
Will you give me a light?
Please. Thank you.

36:33.950 --> 36:35.980
I suppose it's foolish
to be medieval about it,

36:36.160 --> 36:37.830
but how am I gonna explain
to the children

36:37.930 --> 36:40.090
that their mother is having an affair?

36:43.300 --> 36:44.630
- What, what, what?
- My God!

36:44.800 --> 36:48.630
Are you all right? I couldn't see.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Are you all right?

36:48.800 --> 36:51.530
- No, just scared.
- Mom, are you...?

36:52.170 --> 36:55.630
- Mr. Williams.
- Wilson, for God's sake.

36:55.810 --> 36:57.610
What happened, Mommy?

36:57.780 --> 37:00.370
Well, David,
an amusing thing happened.

37:00.550 --> 37:04.880
Uh, well, first of all, uh, ah,
Evelyn had another puppy.

37:05.050 --> 37:07.540
- Yep.
- Then, uh, Mr. Wilson's clothes

37:07.720 --> 37:10.820
- were so torn that...
- You dropped your towel.

37:11.890 --> 37:12.890
Oh.

37:21.430 --> 37:27.200
It was decided that I would be the one
to explain things to the children.

37:28.370 --> 37:31.970
I'm afraid. I'm afraid.
I don't wanna go down the slide.

37:32.150 --> 37:33.170
Nothing to it.

37:34.110 --> 37:36.840
- Then why don't you do it?
- Because I got troubles of my own.

37:37.020 --> 37:39.450
<i>Bon voyage.</i> Goodbye.

37:39.620 --> 37:45.680
Uh, Caroline. Oh, excuse me.
Wait a minute. Caroline.

37:46.390 --> 37:49.920
- I don't think I'm doing anything...
- Caroline. Excuse me, um...

37:50.100 --> 37:52.930
Um, there's something I'd like to talk
to you about, huh?

37:53.100 --> 37:59.060
- Right now? Can't it wait?
- Yeah, sure it can wait. Excuse me.

37:59.240 --> 38:01.900
Come on over here
where we can talk.

38:11.450 --> 38:13.580
- How old are you now?
- Twelve.

38:13.750 --> 38:15.950
Twelve?
Gee, that's practically grown-up.

38:16.520 --> 38:19.980
I was reading about a little 12-year-old
South American girl

38:20.160 --> 38:25.060
- had a baby of her own.
- She should have been more careful.

38:26.570 --> 38:29.760
Well, I guess we can skip the birds
and the bees.

38:32.140 --> 38:36.130
Caroline says that you're sleeping
with our mother.

38:36.780 --> 38:39.080
You don't beat around the bush,
do you?

38:39.880 --> 38:40.900
Are you?

38:42.480 --> 38:46.250
Well, uh, you might, uh...

38:46.420 --> 38:52.260
...almost say... Well, no,
you damn well better say it.

38:55.930 --> 38:58.300
Do you love her?

38:58.460 --> 38:59.460
Yes.

39:03.300 --> 39:05.900
You gonna marry her?

39:06.070 --> 39:11.380
Well, I haven't made
any promises to her.

39:11.540 --> 39:14.380
I can't make any to you, either.

39:16.720 --> 39:19.310
- Can we tell our friends?
- Tell your friends?

39:19.490 --> 39:21.040
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

39:21.220 --> 39:24.380
- Tell your friends what?
- About you and mother.

39:24.560 --> 39:25.750
They always ask.

39:26.660 --> 39:29.290
They're not starting to write things
on the sidewalk, are they?

39:30.460 --> 39:31.460
No.

39:32.330 --> 39:36.000
Some of them say you're too old
for anything, anyway.

39:40.840 --> 39:42.370
Sorry if I embarrassed you.

39:43.710 --> 39:45.470
I think it's time we took
the children home.

39:45.610 --> 39:47.580
Good idea.

39:50.880 --> 39:56.910
Um, Caroline, there's something I'd
like to discuss with you like two adults.

39:57.090 --> 39:59.560
Look, Mr. Wilson, what you and
mother do is your own business.

39:59.660 --> 40:01.590
You don't have to try
and play father too.

40:01.760 --> 40:03.700
- It's not necessary.
- Well, what the...?

40:03.860 --> 40:07.030
Mommy, Mommy, look,
I bought me a balloon.

40:07.200 --> 40:10.030
- Terrific.
- Yeah, and look at it, it's pretty.

40:10.200 --> 40:13.330
- Oh, wonderful. Hi, girls.
- Hi.

40:13.510 --> 40:16.570
- What did you tell them?
- No, they told me.

40:17.110 --> 40:21.170
Look, against my instincts,
against all my better judgment,

40:21.350 --> 40:23.790
I'm gonna say something
I may regret for the rest of my life.

40:23.920 --> 40:26.010
- I love you, Mrs. Kozlenko.
- Shh.

40:26.190 --> 40:28.440
What you mean, shh! Why not?
Everybody might as well hear it.

40:28.540 --> 40:32.590
They know it all ready, anyway.
I love you, Mrs. Kozlenko.

40:32.760 --> 40:35.400
- I want you to marry me.
- Oh, Peter, you don't have to say that.

40:35.500 --> 40:37.120
I'm not just saying it, I mean it.

40:37.300 --> 40:39.060
I'm trying to prove
to these underage cynics

40:39.170 --> 40:41.430
that they're wrong
about me and you're not.

40:44.900 --> 40:48.670
In case you're interested,
even at our age, we still can.

41:00.390 --> 41:04.380
<i>Mr. Wilson? Mr. Wilson?</i>

41:05.120 --> 41:08.290
<i>- Mr. Wilson?</i>
<i>- Hmm, yeah. Who is it?</i>

41:08.460 --> 41:10.830
<i>Mrs. Hayworth, your day nurse.</i>

41:11.000 --> 41:13.020
<i>Your wife is on the phone.</i>

41:13.200 --> 41:17.300
<i>- Tell her I'm not in.</i>
<i>- That isn't very considerate.</i>

41:17.470 --> 41:19.960
<i>She sounded very worried.</i>

41:20.140 --> 41:22.740
Peter. Peter.

41:26.050 --> 41:27.250
Peter.

41:28.880 --> 41:31.720
Oh, the hell with it.

41:32.120 --> 41:33.520
Steven.

41:35.620 --> 41:37.020
Steven.

41:38.590 --> 41:42.190
I suppose you've forgotten
who Steven Kozlenko is.

41:43.830 --> 41:47.100
That's him and his Instamatic.

41:47.270 --> 41:49.790
We, me and Terry,
had decided we would marry

41:49.970 --> 41:51.610
and spend the summer
at the beach cottage

41:51.770 --> 41:55.000
she had rested from Steven
in the divorce settlement.

41:55.780 --> 42:00.180
The wedding was held in the garden.
Not exactly of Eden.

42:00.350 --> 42:01.350
Oops.

42:02.420 --> 42:07.380
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
together here in the sight of God

42:07.550 --> 42:08.990
and in the face of this company

42:09.820 --> 42:13.950
to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony.

42:14.130 --> 42:16.030
- Here we go.
- That's right. Thank you.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.360
If any man can show just cause

42:18.530 --> 42:20.630
why they may not
lawfully be joined together,

42:21.370 --> 42:27.310
let him now speak or else
hereafter and forever hold his peace.

42:27.470 --> 42:32.810
I require and charge you both that if
either of you know any impediment

42:33.380 --> 42:35.580
why ye may not
lawfully be joined together...

42:35.750 --> 42:37.650
- Daddy, Daddy.
- Daddy, Daddy.

42:37.820 --> 42:43.050
...now confess it or else
hereafter and forever hold your peace.

42:43.220 --> 42:45.710
- Peter Edward Wilson,
- Huh?

42:45.890 --> 42:49.380
do you take this woman
to thy lawful wedded wife?

42:49.560 --> 42:54.020
To love, honor and keep her
in sickness and in health

42:54.200 --> 42:58.640
- as long as ye both shall live?
- I do.

42:58.800 --> 43:01.400
Theresa Alice Kozlenko,

43:01.570 --> 43:04.700
do you take this man
to thy lawful wedded husband

43:04.880 --> 43:11.370
to love and keep him in sickness
and in health and forsaking all others,

43:11.550 --> 43:15.990
keep thee only unto him
so long as you both shall live?

43:16.160 --> 43:17.280
She does.

43:17.460 --> 43:20.320
- Well, do you?
- Do I what?

43:20.490 --> 43:25.730
Oh, yes, of course. I do. I do. I do.

43:25.900 --> 43:29.860
Place the ring upon her finger
and repeat after me.

43:33.610 --> 43:39.010
- With this ring, I thee wed.
- With this ring, I thee wed.

43:40.980 --> 43:47.510
Those whom God hath joined
together, let no man put asunder.

43:47.690 --> 43:51.890
I pronounce that you are now
man and wife.

44:05.370 --> 44:07.840
It's raining, ha, ha.

44:09.210 --> 44:11.510
David, get inside,
you're getting soaked.

44:11.680 --> 44:15.310
I don't wanna go in.
I like it. I like it.

44:17.720 --> 44:19.950
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thanks.

44:20.120 --> 44:22.050
- Do you mind if I kiss the bride?
- Well, I...

44:22.220 --> 44:25.660
Well, Steven, it was nice...

44:29.860 --> 44:31.760
- Unh! You...
- It's raining.

44:31.930 --> 44:33.930
- You two haven't met, have you?
- No, we haven't.

44:34.030 --> 44:38.660
This is Steven Kozlenko, my husband.
I mean, was Steven Kozlenko.

44:38.840 --> 44:41.830
He still is Steven Kozlenko
but he was my husband.

44:42.010 --> 44:44.140
- You're my husband now.
- Hold that thought.

44:44.310 --> 44:45.330
- Yes.
- Heh.

44:45.510 --> 44:46.990
Why don't we go inside?
It's raining.

44:47.110 --> 44:49.580
- Oh, yeah, come on, kid, let's go.
- Good idea!

44:49.750 --> 44:51.350
Go, heh.

44:56.390 --> 44:57.980
Here's your...

44:59.430 --> 45:03.390
But I was...
I was just gonna do that.

45:09.740 --> 45:12.300
<i>After the honeymoon,</i>
<i>it only took me four or five days</i>

45:12.470 --> 45:14.530
<i>to persuade Steven</i>
<i>to get out of our lives</i>

45:14.710 --> 45:17.300
<i>and go back to New York.</i>

45:17.480 --> 45:20.390
<i>I was pleased to see how happily</i>
<i>the children were looking forward</i>

45:20.490 --> 45:21.970
<i>- to my career as their father.</i>
- Daddy!

45:22.070 --> 45:23.940
Oh, oh, hey, hey!

45:28.550 --> 45:31.550
<i>And in the days that followed,</i>
<i>married life settled down</i>

45:31.720 --> 45:35.560
<i>to being everything</i>
<i>I always imagined it would be.</i>

45:36.700 --> 45:38.890
- Darling. Darling.
- Yeah. Yeah?

45:39.060 --> 45:45.400
I really hate to ask you, but will you
go downstairs and put on the coffee?

45:45.970 --> 45:49.530
- Why?
- Because you love me.

45:53.180 --> 45:54.180
See?

46:09.430 --> 46:12.060
I'm gonna put some on for you too.

46:19.870 --> 46:24.210
- David, what are you doing there?
- I'm scared.

46:24.380 --> 46:26.900
- Of what?
- Of everything.

46:28.610 --> 46:30.280
Welcome to the club.

46:33.820 --> 46:36.290
- What is it?
- May I brush my teeth?

46:36.460 --> 46:40.650
- I have to get to work.
- Of course, darling, it's all yours.

46:41.590 --> 46:45.530
- Watch out for the clothesline.
- I'll try.

47:08.750 --> 47:09.780
Excuse me.

47:09.960 --> 47:11.720
I thought you kids
had your own bathroom.

47:11.890 --> 47:13.320
The water pipe is broken.

47:13.490 --> 47:16.050
Has anybody seen my stockings,
they were right here on the sink.

47:16.160 --> 47:18.460
Yeah, I put them on the, uh...

47:19.130 --> 47:21.400
They weren't done soaking yet.
You could ruin them.

47:21.570 --> 47:23.430
Well, I have to brush my teeth,
honey.

47:23.600 --> 47:28.010
What did you need the sink for?
Couldn't you put them in a glass?

47:33.580 --> 47:37.180
The terrible thing about children is
they mean it.

47:47.960 --> 47:50.360
David, I thought
I sent you back to bed.

47:50.830 --> 47:55.030
Everybody's in the bathroom.
I'm afraid to be alone.

47:55.200 --> 47:56.200
Oh.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
Listen, David,
if you never remember anything else

48:00.170 --> 48:05.340
I ever told you, remember this:
Loneliness is a gift from heaven.

48:07.480 --> 48:11.470
- David, Peter, please hurry up.
- We're coming. We're coming.

48:11.650 --> 48:13.920
Somebody can have my breakfast,
I never eat breakfast.

48:14.090 --> 48:18.320
- I just have black coffee.
- We always eat a big breakfast.

48:18.490 --> 48:21.520
- Doesn't everybody?
- Yeah, well, that's fine.

48:21.690 --> 48:22.890
I mean, that's perfectly fine.

48:23.060 --> 48:24.900
You should eat
what you've always been eating.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.840
I just have black coffee so I'll just
keep on having just black coffee.

48:28.570 --> 48:32.500
- You said that.
- Thank you.

48:33.410 --> 48:36.640
Is my father gonna be
allowed to come to my birthday party?

48:39.580 --> 48:41.980
Well, of course he is, dear, isn't he?

48:43.420 --> 48:47.220
Yeah, I didn't come into this family
to separate you from anyone.

48:47.390 --> 48:50.220
I mean, I just think
we should all be comfortable.

48:50.390 --> 48:52.720
Do exactly as we please.

48:55.360 --> 48:56.490
That's Bernie.

48:57.360 --> 48:58.760
Doesn't he have a last name?

48:58.930 --> 49:00.830
- We haven't gotten to that.
- Hmm.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.600
We're still on a first-name basis.
I'll be back for lunch.

49:04.770 --> 49:06.000
So will Bernie, I'll bet.

49:06.170 --> 49:08.200
Caroline, you know
I don't like that boy.

49:08.370 --> 49:11.070
Mom, you don't even know him.

49:11.240 --> 49:14.910
And anyway, Mr. Wilson said
we could do exactly as we pleased.

49:16.110 --> 49:18.880
That's right.
You did say that, didn't you?

49:20.620 --> 49:22.680
I wish you'd talk to her about him.

49:22.860 --> 49:27.050
- Well, isn't that Steven's job?
- No, dear, not anymore.

49:27.230 --> 49:31.320
- David, eat your breakfast.
- It doesn't exactly please me.

49:31.500 --> 49:34.130
- Why not?
- Eggs have pollution.

49:34.300 --> 49:39.100
I heard it on TV and I think they said
something about waffles too.

49:39.270 --> 49:40.930
Polluted waffles?

49:41.110 --> 49:44.410
Well, you eat your breakfast
or you don't get anything to eat all day.

49:44.580 --> 49:48.540
- Could I just...?
- I'm scared to eat it. Do I have to?

49:49.250 --> 49:51.370
Come on, sport, if we're gonna go,
let's go together.

49:52.480 --> 49:54.280
All right.

49:59.990 --> 50:01.050
Daddy!

50:01.230 --> 50:04.750
<i>Linda's birthday</i>
<i>was a cause for celebration</i>

50:04.930 --> 50:08.800
<i>until Steven came back</i>
<i>slithering across the sand.</i>

50:09.740 --> 50:11.600
<i>It was a typical family scene,</i>

50:11.770 --> 50:17.610
<i>sticky with charm and sentiment</i>
<i>and just a hint of sexual perversion.</i>

50:21.050 --> 50:22.340
<i>You and me, babe</i>

50:22.510 --> 50:23.950
<i>Friends to the end</i>

50:24.120 --> 50:27.990
<i>- Just you and me</i>
<i>- You and me</i>

50:28.150 --> 50:32.990
<i>Close as two monkeys</i>
<i>Sitting in a bamboo tree</i>

50:33.160 --> 50:34.490
<i>Bamboo tree</i>

50:34.660 --> 50:37.630
<i>You and me, babe</i>
<i>The perfect blending</i>

50:37.800 --> 50:39.630
<i>You and me</i>

50:39.800 --> 50:41.600
<i>You and me</i>

50:41.770 --> 50:45.260
<i>- In a tree</i>
<i>- In a tree</i>

50:45.440 --> 50:48.520
<i>- In a tree, you and me, in a tree</i>
<i>- In a tree, you and me, in a tree</i>

50:48.620 --> 50:49.740
<i>You and me, babe</i>

50:49.910 --> 50:52.500
- I'll get you a beer.
- Coke.

50:52.680 --> 50:54.870
I'm teaching you to grow up,
remember?

50:55.050 --> 50:56.540
<i>Close as two monkeys</i>

50:56.720 --> 50:58.580
<i>Sitting in a bamboo tree</i>

50:58.750 --> 51:00.810
Your mother asked me
to talk to you about him.

51:00.990 --> 51:02.650
Go ahead.

51:02.820 --> 51:05.660
- Think it'll do any good?
- No.

51:05.820 --> 51:07.540
That's what I figured.
If your mother asks,

51:07.660 --> 51:09.360
at least you can say
that we talked.

51:09.530 --> 51:12.230
<i>You and me, babe</i>
<i>Right from the start</i>

51:12.400 --> 51:13.700
<i>It's you and me</i>

51:13.870 --> 51:15.960
<i>In a car, in a bar</i>
<i>Or far away</i>

51:16.130 --> 51:19.230
<i>Sweeter than honey</i>
<i>From a pair of honey bees</i>

51:19.400 --> 51:22.700
<i>You and me within reach</i>
<i>On a beach or a star away</i>

51:22.870 --> 51:25.610
<i>You and me, babe</i>
<i>Well, cross my heart</i>

51:25.780 --> 51:27.110
<i>Just you and me</i>

51:27.280 --> 51:29.440
<i>What a pair, you're still there</i>
<i>When you are away</i>

51:29.610 --> 51:33.010
<i>You and me</i>

51:35.750 --> 51:39.060
<i>You and me</i>

51:39.160 --> 51:42.620
- I don't wanna go in the water.
- Hi.

51:43.160 --> 51:45.430
- Aren't you going in the water?
- No.

51:45.600 --> 51:46.900
Well, why not?

51:47.070 --> 51:49.860
It's all polluted. I don't wanna die.

51:50.040 --> 51:52.270
You're not gonna die
as long as you can swim.

51:52.440 --> 51:56.770
It's killing the fish and they can swim
a lot better than I can.

51:56.940 --> 51:59.040
Just what are you gonna do
with your life, huh?

51:59.210 --> 52:01.980
Are you gonna never go in the water,
never eat anything again?

52:02.210 --> 52:07.020
Maybe.
I might have to hold my breath too.

52:07.190 --> 52:14.990
<i>- You and me</i>
<i>- You and me</i>

52:21.100 --> 52:22.970
- Whoo.
- Oh.

52:28.010 --> 52:32.970
Mother says
you're going away again. Are you?

52:33.150 --> 52:37.480
Well, baby, that's my job.
Going away is what I do.

52:38.920 --> 52:39.940
I know.

52:40.120 --> 52:42.310
But I always come back, don't I?

52:46.430 --> 52:47.430
Sure.

52:54.770 --> 52:57.170
I guess
you could die from lots of things.

52:57.340 --> 53:00.700
Well, boredom is the worst
and having fun is the best.

53:00.870 --> 53:03.270
Not dying at all is even better.

53:03.440 --> 53:06.500
Not if you're gonna spend
the rest of your life being scared.

53:06.680 --> 53:09.340
I'm not scared, I'm just careful.

53:09.510 --> 53:11.110
Come on.

53:12.720 --> 53:14.650
Follow me.

53:14.820 --> 53:19.350
- Thattaboy. Nice going.
- Put me up on there.

53:19.520 --> 53:21.320
- Huh?
- Put me up on there.

53:21.490 --> 53:22.490
No.

53:22.860 --> 53:26.350
- What's the matter? You scared?
- No, just careful.

53:26.530 --> 53:29.700
- Please?
- Heh, all right.

53:31.300 --> 53:34.970
See once you get used to something
new then you're no longer...

53:36.340 --> 53:39.330
David! Hang on!

53:39.510 --> 53:41.310
David, come on.

53:41.480 --> 53:44.880
Okay! I'm coming!

54:13.810 --> 54:18.270
- Darling, love me, love me, love me.
- No, please, not here.

54:18.450 --> 54:21.350
I don't even like sand in my spinach.

54:25.990 --> 54:28.150
What the hell are you doing?

54:28.330 --> 54:31.190
I've been giving you
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

54:31.360 --> 54:33.830
What did you think I was doing?

54:35.400 --> 54:36.420
Well, what happened?

54:36.600 --> 54:39.590
You were drowning in 2 feet of water
when I pulled you out.

54:39.770 --> 54:43.440
- Hey, can't you swim?
- Now that I think of it, no.

54:43.610 --> 54:47.670
You two better get in the house
and get warm. I'll make some tea.

54:48.180 --> 54:50.580
And thank you,
thank you very much.

54:50.750 --> 54:54.740
We better go get cleaned up.
We're polluted.

55:13.770 --> 55:16.260
Darling, darling.

55:16.440 --> 55:20.310
- What? What are you...?
- Shh, shh.

55:20.480 --> 55:22.120
There's something
walking around outside.

55:22.250 --> 55:23.720
You better go downstairs and check.

55:23.880 --> 55:28.480
- What?
- Go on. Now. Come on.

55:30.820 --> 55:35.660
- Have you got a gun?
- What? Uh, don't be ridiculous.

55:36.530 --> 55:38.760
You probably won't need it anyway.

55:40.330 --> 55:42.270
What do you mean, "probably"?

55:43.600 --> 55:47.730
There were a lot of strange characters
on the beach after the party.

56:06.860 --> 56:09.020
David,
what are you doing here again?

56:09.190 --> 56:11.320
- I heard a noise.
- Huh, shh.

56:12.700 --> 56:15.930
It's all right to sleep in front of your
father's door when you hear noises.

56:16.100 --> 56:19.090
Why don't you sleep in front
of Steven's door? He's your father.

56:19.270 --> 56:22.140
Then why isn't he sleeping
with my mother?

56:23.210 --> 56:26.140
- Give him time. Go on.
- Okay.

57:56.100 --> 57:57.540
Drop that gun
and don't make a move.

57:57.640 --> 57:59.600
Anything you say,
just don't kiss me again.

57:59.770 --> 58:02.300
Peter, what the hell
are you doing down here?

58:02.470 --> 58:04.200
I heard you walking around
down here.

58:04.380 --> 58:06.620
I wasn't walking around
till I heard you walking around.

58:07.910 --> 58:09.640
That's it.

58:12.120 --> 58:13.520
- Watch out.
- Shh, shh.

58:13.690 --> 58:16.420
- I got him! I got him!
- No, I got him!

58:16.590 --> 58:20.050
- I got him! I got him!
- I got him!

58:22.290 --> 58:25.060
What's happening?
What's happening?

58:25.230 --> 58:27.760
No, you got me, for God's sake.

58:29.830 --> 58:30.890
Let go of me!

58:33.070 --> 58:34.770
Boys, get up.

58:34.940 --> 58:38.880
Caroline! What are you doing
coming home at this hour?

58:39.040 --> 58:40.340
My God, it's Caroline.

58:41.150 --> 58:43.120
If I knew I was gonna cause
so much trouble,

58:43.280 --> 58:45.940
I would have stayed out all night.
Who locked the window?

58:46.120 --> 58:47.240
Where were you, Caroline?

58:47.420 --> 58:50.320
You missed all the excitement.
There was a burglar in here.

58:50.490 --> 58:53.390
David, go, go to sleep.
Linda, you too.

58:53.560 --> 58:56.490
- Why can't I listen? It's my birthday.
- Not anymore.

58:56.660 --> 58:59.860
- It's almost 4 a.m.
- I didn't realize it was so late.

59:00.030 --> 59:03.520
- Where were you?
- With Bernie, naturally.

59:03.700 --> 59:05.760
- She was with Bernie?
- Naturally.

59:05.940 --> 59:07.660
You know what I've told you
about that boy.

59:08.310 --> 59:11.040
Mother, you're not really gonna
lecture me on morality, are you?

59:11.210 --> 59:13.110
What does that mean?

59:13.280 --> 59:16.040
Well, you know how it is,
you get talking and time just flies.

59:16.210 --> 59:18.710
You got home at 5 a.m.

59:19.780 --> 59:21.220
Told you she wouldn't believe it.

59:21.390 --> 59:23.470
- What's she talking about?
- None of your business.

59:23.590 --> 59:26.560
Caroline, go up to bed.

59:26.720 --> 59:29.520
Sure. Caroline, go to bed.
That'll solve everything.

59:29.690 --> 59:33.320
- I've had enough of this.
- Mother, I'm not blaming you.

59:33.500 --> 59:35.490
You had a right to do
what you wanted to do.

59:35.670 --> 59:39.260
- But so have I, haven't I?
- We'll talk about it in the morning.

59:39.440 --> 59:41.960
- You and I and your father.
- Which one?

59:48.950 --> 59:50.970
You know, it's not all her fault.

59:51.150 --> 59:53.910
She asked me if she could go
for a drive with him and I said sure.

59:54.590 --> 59:57.520
I should have expected
something like that out of you.

59:57.690 --> 01:00:00.420
Peter, will you go upstairs
and talk to her about this right now?

01:00:00.590 --> 01:00:02.670
Not until I can explain
what we were doing at 5 a.m.

01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:05.320
- Hey, what were you doing?
- I don't have to explain it to you.

01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:08.590
Oh, I'm not criticizing. After all,
Terry and I did the same thing

01:00:08.770 --> 01:00:10.530
before we were married,
didn't we, Terry?

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.530
My God,
is nothing sacred to you men?

01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:16.680
It was sacred to me,
wasn't it sacred to you?

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:17.870
Very sacred.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.480
Steven, I think
it would be an excellent idea for you

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:23.550
- to leave this house immediately.
- Wait. We were just getting along.

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.160
At last
we have something in common.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.380
- Yeah.
- I'm ashamed of you!

01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:29.450
You have no regard for women!

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:32.180
You're setting a terrible example
to Caroline.

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.230
And you're talking about me
as if I were a motel room

01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:37.190
the two of you shared
for the night!

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:39.490
- Unfortunate choice of a simile.
- Yeah, heh.

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:41.290
If you're
such a goddamn good writer,

01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:43.940
how come Doubleday
can't give your book away?

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:46.500
- That's beneath you.
- You don't know me!

01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:49.300
- You don't know how low I can stoop!
- Terry!

01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:54.240
What? Shut up, both of you!
Shut up!

01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:58.950
Male chauvinist pigs!

01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:04.580
Come to bed, one of you! Right now!

01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:09.960
What did we ever see in her?

01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:12.250
I don't know about you,
I'm gonna have another drink.

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:15.160
That's the first intelligent remark
I've heard in the last 15 minutes.

01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:16.790
Has she always had a temper
like that?

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:18.230
- Of course she has.
- Jesus.

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.960
Do you think
I like photographing wars?

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:30.040
By the way, I never, uh,
mentioned your book before

01:01:30.210 --> 01:01:31.580
because I admired it too much.

01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:34.650
It's just too damn good
to talk about, heh.

01:01:35.290 --> 01:01:38.620
Well, I'm not too proud of it.

01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:41.560
Good pictures are always of the dead
and the wounded.

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:47.360
You know,
I like the war in your book better.

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:51.900
You said
what we all think about women

01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:56.600
- and never have the guts to tell them.
- God bless you, sir, heh.

01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:58.500
- Here's to telling them.
- Yeah.

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:02.110
- Over and over.
- And over, and over, and over, heh.

01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:07.220
Do you know what women do
in Africa?

01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:09.850
What?

01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:15.730
They wear a bone in their nose
and they listen to their men!

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:19.490
And if they don't listen, they have
to wear another bone in their nose.

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:23.570
Heh, that's only for two bones
in their... Every woman, two.

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:29.240
And then they crawl off,
see, to their little thatched huts

01:02:29.410 --> 01:02:32.500
and have their damn babies
and they crawl right back

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:35.080
and pick cocoa nuts
for their husbands.

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:39.910
Excellent. Excellent.
Proper division of marital duties.

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:44.380
Do you know what women are doing
in this country, huh?

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:47.790
They're plotting
to take over the world.

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:53.800
They're sneakily outliving men
so that they can inherit everything.

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:59.800
- It's a war, I tell you.
- You are absolutely right.

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:03.230
It's all so clear to me now.

01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:07.980
Hey.

01:03:11.350 --> 01:03:13.550
- What is that you are doing?
- Shh, shh.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:17.280
I'm drawing women
as they really are.

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:20.580
- Is that a woman?
- Well, what does it look like?

01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:23.420
It looks like a horse.

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:29.970
Right. We'll make that a horse

01:03:30.130 --> 01:03:35.700
and then we'll draw a woman
riding him, it.

01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:38.500
- Good luck.
- Uh...

01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:47.220
Uh, there's a horse.
And a disgusting woman riding him.

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:53.490
You know, your horses
look as disgusting as your women.

01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:55.460
Thank you, heh.

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:06.960
Did you see that? Huh?

01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:10.340
- See what?
- One of those women moved.

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:16.440
Grab the muskets!

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:25.980
Here they come!

01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:31.420
Don't shoot
till you see the whites of their eyes.

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:38.960
- Oh, my goodness.
- Duck, huh.

01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:41.130
They're everywhere.
They're all over the place!

01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:45.030
No, you don't.

01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:55.880
They're dropping leaflets!

01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:01.190
Leaflets, hell,
they're bills from Bergdorf's.

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.490
My God, have they no mercy?
Do something. Do something!

01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:09.290
We'll fight them from the beaches,
fight them from the shores,

01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:14.060
and fight them from the...
Ah! My rear!

01:05:16.310 --> 01:05:18.000
- Do me a favor!
- Yeah?

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:19.870
- Cover me, will you?
- I got you.

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:23.810
- I got you, mate, I got you.
- Reinforcements.

01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:27.750
- What are you doing?
- Drawing somebody on our side.

01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:38.620
Ah! Your turn. Now it's your turn.

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:40.500
Blend, blend, blend.

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:45.600
You're liquefied!
I hope that's blood, blood.

01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:51.710
- Well, I got mine. Do something.
- I'm drawing as fast as I can.

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:55.110
Uh, well, draw somebody that knows
what they're doing in a battle.

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.650
For instance?

01:05:56.810 --> 01:05:57.870
Try Moshe Dayan.

01:05:59.150 --> 01:06:00.380
Good thinking.

01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:09.650
They're weakening. Attack.

01:06:13.030 --> 01:06:15.760
- Shalom.
- Shalom.

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.400
Watch out!

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:25.410
Got one. Got two.

01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:29.670
Dirty rotten spies.
Keep up the good work!

01:06:29.850 --> 01:06:32.040
Listen, my children,

01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:39.120
and you shall hear
the Midnight Ride of Paul Revere.

01:06:39.290 --> 01:06:40.490
Peter.

01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:46.720
- Peter!
- Huh? What?

01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:48.660
Aren't you coming up to bed?

01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:53.230
Oh, no, you don't.
That's how you got me the first time.

01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:37.740
What?

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.160
Ahem, hello.

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:03.399
Hello.

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:08.069
Just a minute.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:11.470
It's for you. It's long distance.

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:15.439
- I wonder who it could be.
- Not you, it's for your father.

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:16.640
Which one?

01:09:16.810 --> 01:09:19.810
Don't start that again.
It's for your father.

01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:22.880
Wake up! Long distance!

01:09:23.050 --> 01:09:24.960
- Yeah, yeah. What?
- Cost money.

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:28.149
- Yeah, yeah. Where? Where?
- Look up. It costs money.

01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:32.560
I got it, I got it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Hello, yeah.

01:09:32.729 --> 01:09:36.330
Yeah, this is Kozlenko
or what's left of him.

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:39.899
All right, what? You'll have to speak
louder, I got a bad connection.

01:09:41.609 --> 01:09:43.840
I got a bad connection
inside my head.

01:09:44.010 --> 01:09:47.170
I just... I can't see a thing.
Has anybody seen my glasses?

01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:48.640
You're wearing them.

01:09:48.810 --> 01:09:51.080
Find me a pencil
and take this down, will you?

01:09:51.250 --> 01:09:54.620
Yeah,
my secretary's standing by here.

01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:57.950
Yeah, when? This afternoon?

01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:02.030
- Oh, my...
- Yeah, my passport's okay.

01:10:02.190 --> 01:10:04.660
But I, uh, do need a visa
for the little guy

01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:07.490
that is hammering away
at my temples, heh.

01:10:16.710 --> 01:10:20.800
Peter, for chrissake, you got a pencil?

01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:25.940
I gotta catch a plane someplace,
somewhere. Yeah. Yeah, ahem.

01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:29.350
Yeah, all right, yeah.
All right, go slow, will you?

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:32.120
My assistant, uh,
doesn't take shorthand.

01:10:32.290 --> 01:10:38.590
Yeah, yeah, Kennedy Airport,
Air China, flight 409.

01:10:39.330 --> 01:10:40.350
You got that?

01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:43.730
I think so.

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:45.630
Sure, sure, I'm ready to leave.

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:48.710
As a matter of fact,
I was going to anyway.

01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:52.070
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:53.480
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:10:53.610 --> 01:10:56.340
I hope you men are proud
of what you did last night.

01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:59.750
We don't deserve all the credit.
Moshe Dayan turned the tide.

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:01.010
- Who?
- Yeah.

01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:03.150
Twelve-thirty in the afternoon,
you got that?

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:04.340
I think so.

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:06.750
Okay, give me that pad, will you?

01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:09.880
Jesus.

01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:13.000
You're in worse shape than I am.

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:15.900
Don't worry, I'm gonna take the train
into the city with you.

01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:17.560
I've got it committed to memory.

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:19.360
Where are you going?

01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:22.840
Uh, I have to speak to Howard Mann
about the new book.

01:11:23.010 --> 01:11:24.100
He's been screaming at me.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:27.310
You better get cleaned up, unless
you're thinking of taking a freight train.

01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:30.870
- Yeah, all right.
- Yeah, cleaned up. Yeah.

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:34.420
Ugh, here, the stairs are this way.

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:35.610
I'm new here.

01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:36.810
Good mornings, Daddy.

01:11:36.990 --> 01:11:38.650
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:50.270
Mother, there's dead women
all over the walls.

01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:54.660
Why would men draw
things like that?

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:57.140
It's the only way they can win.

01:12:08.890 --> 01:12:12.650
Two tomato juices with the raw egg
and here's your Tabasco sauce.

01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:14.740
- Thank you.
- Will there be anything else, sir?

01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:18.890
A short prayer. Excuse me.

01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:28.400
- Here's a little salvation for you.
- Thank you.

01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:36.640
You know, it's not easy
leaving them like that.

01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:40.080
I can still see their faces.

01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:44.590
David, Linda, looking up at me.

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:48.320
Caroline growing up, mature, firm.

01:12:48.490 --> 01:12:51.890
Woman. And Terry.

01:12:52.730 --> 01:12:54.860
Heh, you know,
there's always a little something

01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:57.090
between a man and a woman
who bore his children.

01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:59.430
I know you understand that.

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:02.270
I know you don't begrudge me
a few memories

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:07.280
to keep me company in the darkness
and heat and loneliness of the jungle.

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.110
You're full of crap, Steven.

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:11.940
- I beg your pardon?
- You're out and you're glad you're out.

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:13.140
What do you mean?

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.450
You've got a daughter
who doesn't listen to anybody,

01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:19.150
another one who stammers and a son
who can only sleep in front of doors.

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.720
You've loused up a whole family.

01:13:20.890 --> 01:13:23.020
Say, how would you like a belt
in the nose?

01:13:23.190 --> 01:13:25.390
- I wouldn't.
- Heh, damn right.

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.690
A father is supposed
to stay at home.

01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:31.270
He doesn't just breeze
through scattering presents

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:33.670
and singing songs
like a goddamn wood nymph.

01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:36.470
- I think you mean satyr.
- That's right.

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:40.270
A wood nymph has breasts.
At least the ones I've seen.

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:42.310
And ivy growing out of their hair.

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:44.640
Well, you think I don't know
why you came back?

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:47.680
Because when you found out that
Terry was marrying somebody else,

01:13:47.850 --> 01:13:49.410
it turned you on.

01:13:52.690 --> 01:13:55.090
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:58.950
Yeah, it did, actually.

01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:02.590
Penn Station.
Pennsylvania Station.

01:14:02.770 --> 01:14:05.170
You're just not cut out
for this kind of life, Steven.

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:06.980
Go back and forth
to an office every day.

01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:09.330
You'd lose your mind
before your transfers ran out.

01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:11.530
I suppose you don't feel
that way sometimes?

01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:14.180
- Sometimes.
- You should be the first to understand.

01:14:17.150 --> 01:14:19.550
- Uh, Steven.
- What?

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:22.520
Yeah. Uh, these glasses
make my headache worse

01:14:22.690 --> 01:14:24.760
and I can't see without them.
Would you help me out?

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:28.590
I'm not seeing too well
myself today. Uh, hang on.

01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:31.190
Maybe we can make it together.

01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:38.630
- Steve?
- Yeah.

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:41.030
I think you ought to give your kids
a break.

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:44.660
Stop playing on them like they
were violins, let them get over you.

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:47.140
- Terry too?
- She's over you.

01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:49.470
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

01:14:49.650 --> 01:14:52.810
I believe you. I believe you
and I respect your opinion.

01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:54.980
- But are you sure?
- Absolutely.

01:14:55.150 --> 01:14:58.680
Christ, I'll be upset for weeks over this,
I guarantee you.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.720
Damn women.

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:12.370
Hot pants, miniskirts, no brassieres,
why can't they leave us alone?

01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:15.640
There's a cab, uh,
you think you can make it all right?

01:15:15.810 --> 01:15:18.780
- Yeah. Where you going?
- I gotta tell her what I think of her

01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:20.880
and my plane leaves at 12:30, heh.

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.520
There's... Uh, you're sure
you can make it all right now, huh?

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:26.280
I'm fine. Just don't kiss me goodbye.

01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:35.620
750 Madison.

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:43.090
When did you first feel the pain?

01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:45.860
This morning. Maybe last night.

01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:49.370
Everything about last night
is understandably vague.

01:15:50.210 --> 01:15:54.800
The condition is acute.
There's gonna have to be an operation.

01:15:55.410 --> 01:15:57.810
- Do you appreciate frankness?
- Yes.

01:15:57.980 --> 01:16:01.710
What I don't appreciate is people who
say, "Do you appreciate frankness?"

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:09.430
- There's less than a fifty-fifty chance.
- Of what?

01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:12.290
That you'll ever see anything.

01:16:14.230 --> 01:16:16.600
Well, at least
I won't have to watch television.

01:16:16.770 --> 01:16:21.170
- Want me to call your wife?
- Uh, no.

01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:23.400
You're not going home, you know.

01:16:23.570 --> 01:16:27.070
I want you in the hospital tonight
and we'll operate in the morning.

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:30.870
Well, in that case,
maybe I better call.

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:36.550
Would you dial an operator for me?

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:43.680
Peter? Do you know
what you're gonna say?

01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:46.090
Mm-hm. Let's have lunch.

01:16:51.170 --> 01:16:52.900
I don't know
what you're trying to explain to me.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.960
- Let go of my arm.
- I can't let go. That's what.

01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:57.660
- Why?
- I might fall down.

01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:59.430
We haven't even had
our first martini.

01:16:59.610 --> 01:17:03.070
It's my eyes. The doctor says
I have to have an operation on my eyes.

01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:05.370
- Your eyes?
- That's why I want you to talk to Terry

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:07.310
- at lunch, huh?
- Operation?

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:10.850
I may go blind.
Easy, Howard. Are you okay?

01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:13.250
I almost fainted.

01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:16.380
If I had known you were gonna take it
that hard, I wouldn't have told you.

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.560
Suppose it was a mistake, huh?
See another doctor.

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:21.960
I've seen another doctor
and there's no mistake.

01:17:22.130 --> 01:17:23.620
It's always the good guys.

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:26.100
Howard, stop it. You gotta go in there
and speak to her.

01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:27.670
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- You all right?

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:31.100
Yeah. I'm all right now.

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:34.770
Now, remember, I don't want her
to know anything about this.

01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:37.140
You've got so much courage,
I'm goddamn awed.

01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:38.630
- That's very well put.
- Thanks.

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:41.510
Now, you're to tell her
that you gotta lock me up

01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:43.310
- Watch it.
- for a week

01:17:43.490 --> 01:17:44.890
in order to finish the book.

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:47.460
There's to be no phone calls
and no visitors.

01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:49.320
- Careful.
- Okay.

01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:51.690
And she's not to try to contact me.
You got it?

01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:56.600
- Uh-huh. Got it.
- Howard, if you betray me on this,

01:17:56.770 --> 01:17:58.600
I'm gonna beat you to death
with my white cane

01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:01.370
and feed your remains to my dog.

01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:04.600
I'm ready.

01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:18.790
Well, uh, Terry, the problem is...
Actually, that lazy husband of yours

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:21.650
- owes me a book.
- Howard, heh.

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:23.990
- And you're crying about it?
- Well, you know Howard,

01:18:24.090 --> 01:18:26.360
he gets upset
whenever money is involved.

01:18:26.530 --> 01:18:27.850
- Let's cheer up, Howard.
- Yeah.

01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:29.690
Let's all have a drink.
Waiter. Waiter?

01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:31.460
- Yes, sir.
- Three double martinis.

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:33.040
- I'll have the same.
- Forget his.

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:35.140
Pull yourself together, huh, Howard.

01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:37.430
And don't worry about the book,
I'll get it finished.

01:18:38.110 --> 01:18:42.710
Now, uh, love, Howard, uh...

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:45.720
He wants to lock me up at his place
on the Cape until the book is done.

01:18:45.850 --> 01:18:49.010
- Isn't that right, Howard?
- That's right. The book.

01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:51.290
He promised me
that book a month ago

01:18:51.390 --> 01:18:53.350
and I'm gonna lock him up
and throw away the key,

01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:54.980
so you won't be seeing him
for a week.

01:18:55.090 --> 01:18:56.120
- Right?
- Right.

01:18:56.290 --> 01:18:57.660
That's right, Howard.

01:18:58.430 --> 01:19:01.800
So don't worry about him because
that's where's he's gonna be.

01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:03.990
Locked up in my cabin in Cape Cod.

01:19:04.170 --> 01:19:06.250
Don't phone him.
He'll phone you when it's all over.

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:07.840
Nothing's gonna happen to him

01:19:08.010 --> 01:19:10.530
because all he's gonna be doing
is finishing the goddamn book.

01:19:10.710 --> 01:19:12.440
Well, it'll be pretty tough on me,

01:19:12.610 --> 01:19:14.280
but if that's the way you want it,
Howard.

01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:18.320
You're lying, lying, lying.
Both of you are lying.

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:19.540
Lying, me?

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:22.750
You'd never make such a big deal about
going away to work for a week, Peter.

01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:24.250
Me? What...? Of course, I would.

01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:26.650
God, what a suspicious animal
the female is.

01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:28.820
You'd assume
we were with two broads.

01:19:28.990 --> 01:19:31.090
- Are you?
- Maybe.

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:35.790
- Is he?
- No, no, there are no women. No.

01:19:35.970 --> 01:19:38.330
- He's going to Cape Cod.
- Yeah.

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:40.300
- God, I can't stand it any longer.
- Howard.

01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:41.460
I'm gonna tell her.

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.400
Howard, you son of a bitch,
you promised me.

01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:45.150
I don't care.
Your courage makes me sick.

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:47.110
- Howard, please!
- She's got a right to know.

01:19:47.210 --> 01:19:49.090
- Your husband's going blind.
- Howard, please.

01:19:49.210 --> 01:19:51.130
Now look what you've done,
you've shattered her.

01:19:51.250 --> 01:19:53.620
- Howard, blow your nose.
- Thank you.

01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:55.220
May I have another drink, Peter?

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:57.950
Be careful. Those things are dynamite
on an empty stomach.

01:19:58.120 --> 01:19:59.380
- Shut up, Howard.
- I'm fine.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:02.860
Look, love, please try to understand
there was no point in telling you

01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:06.260
- before it was all over with.
- I know about your eyes, Peter.

01:20:08.630 --> 01:20:11.360
- What does that mean?
- I've always known

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:14.130
from the beginning.
Dr. Harris told me the first day.

01:20:15.670 --> 01:20:20.240
- You mean you married me knowing?
- Jesus, what guts. What devotion.

01:20:20.410 --> 01:20:22.680
- Shut up, Howard.
- Shut up, Howard.

01:20:22.850 --> 01:20:25.080
You mean that you married me
pitying me?

01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:27.380
- I never pitied you.
- You hypocrite.

01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:30.180
For God's sakes, be sensible.

01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:32.410
You went to bed with me
feeling sorry for me.

01:20:32.590 --> 01:20:36.030
I went to bed with you because
I enjoyed going to bed with you.

01:20:36.190 --> 01:20:38.910
And because I thought you'd make
a wonderful father for my children.

01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:41.560
Caroline, Linda and they...
Don't tell me they know.

01:20:41.730 --> 01:20:43.100
- Of course they know.
- My God.

01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:45.470
How could they help
but know the way you fumble around,

01:20:45.570 --> 01:20:46.590
how could they help?

01:20:46.770 --> 01:20:48.410
Goddamn it,
being pitied by a 6-year-old.

01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:50.100
- A baby.
- Shut up and sit down.

01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:51.910
This is a moment
you should share alone...

01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:53.360
- Shut up!
- You sent Steven away

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:56.240
because you felt it was your duty
to be near your poor blind husband.

01:20:56.350 --> 01:20:58.010
- Let me out.
- Sit down and shut up.

01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:00.950
- Steven went away. He always goes.
- He'll be back. He promised.

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:03.840
He also left a little innuendo
that you and he and maybe a little...

01:21:03.950 --> 01:21:08.260
For God's sakes. Stop that now.
I don't give a damn about Steven.

01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:10.360
- You're lying.
- Peter.

01:21:10.530 --> 01:21:13.960
You're like all the rest of the women.
You're basically a liar, you're dishonest,

01:21:14.130 --> 01:21:18.730
and you're patronizing and you can't
wait to get a charity case to adopt!

01:21:22.410 --> 01:21:24.970
I don't understand what happened
to you brave, wonderful people.

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:28.200
Let's get the hell out of here, shall we?
Before that broad comes back

01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:30.400
and starts pitying me
because she ruined my suit.

01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:34.180
Peter. Peter, wait a second.
Wait a second. I'll call her. I'll explain.

01:21:34.350 --> 01:21:37.190
You do, Howard, and I'll kill you.

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:42.020
Howard?

01:21:44.590 --> 01:21:47.190
Peter. Peter.

01:21:49.570 --> 01:21:52.170
Peter. Peter.

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:58.010
Howard. Howard.

01:21:58.810 --> 01:22:01.870
Hold still, Peter, it's time.

01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:03.340
For what?

01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:05.680
I'm gonna remove the bandage.

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:10.150
- Just like that? No trumpets?
- That may come later.

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:13.450
Easy now. Don't move your head.

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:16.320
Just relax.

01:22:17.890 --> 01:22:20.760
So far so good, keep going.

01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:23.090
That's it.

01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:25.730
Twelve hundred bucks for this?

01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:27.630
I'm afraid so.

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:31.610
- What's it like?
- Well, not so deep as a well,

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:36.340
nor so wide as a barn,
but it will serve.

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.940
Can you distinguish anything?

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:42.520
Yeah, bright light.

01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:45.520
Some color.

01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:52.290
Few shadows. One of them,
I guess, is you over there.

01:22:53.130 --> 01:22:56.430
- It's me.
- Chrissake, is she here?

01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:57.860
- Peter, don't...
- I told you.

01:22:58.030 --> 01:23:00.900
- Peter, don't get excited.
- Excited? I've been violated.

01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:02.100
I'll leave you two alone.

01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:04.370
- Where are you going?
- I have other patients.

01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:07.380
Well, God help them.

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:15.610
- Why did you come?
- I was worried about you.

01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:17.650
- Perfectly natural.
- Heh, perfectly.

01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:19.920
Women always worry
about helpless men.

01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:22.580
And small puppies
and donkeys too old to pull carts.

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:24.920
Don't you think
you can pull a cart anymore?

01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:27.830
Certainly I can over a cliff
or in front of a truck.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.930
What's the matter with you?

01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:34.340
Don't you realize you'd be better off
with somebody else now?

01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:37.970
Like Steven, for example?

01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:41.840
He's got a lot more substance
than you ever gave him credit for.

01:23:42.010 --> 01:23:47.640
The two of you had something.
You know, both of you and the kids.

01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:49.480
We'd never match that.

01:23:49.650 --> 01:23:53.220
- You'd send me back to Steven?
- I wouldn't stand in your way.

01:23:53.390 --> 01:23:56.490
- I want you to know that. Mm-hm.
- Well, that's very unselfish of you.

01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:58.900
- Noble and fine and good.
- What does all of that mean?

01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:03.530
And after I leave, you get nailed to
an eye chart, burned in your pajamas.

01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:05.500
And we build a new religion
around you.

01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:10.470
- That's not very nice.
- You have a wife and three children.

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:13.610
You're using this to get out of it,
that's not very nice either.

01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:16.110
I am being practical and objective.

01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:19.680
I cannot go back to him.

01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:26.050
As you said or I think you said, you've
had three kids together, it's no big deal.

01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:28.020
Steven is dead.

01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:30.660
What?

01:24:32.430 --> 01:24:37.830
I tried to tell you
but you would not answer my calls.

01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:40.030
How did it happen?

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:47.370
Well, uh, he was in this, uh...

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:51.380
He was in this house

01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:55.540
and, uh, he was covering a story

01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:59.720
on the, uh, women...

01:25:00.590 --> 01:25:02.890
The women's role in the war...

01:25:03.790 --> 01:25:08.530
And a hand grenade was thrown
through the window.

01:25:10.630 --> 01:25:13.000
Blown up in a whorehouse.

01:25:16.410 --> 01:25:21.940
When I heard, all I could think about

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:31.680
was how glad I was
that it wasn't you.

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:38.250
I'm sorry, I'm terribly sorry.
How are the kids taking it?

01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:40.290
Uh, ahem.

01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:44.900
Caroline is being very adult about it.

01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:49.930
David doesn't understand,

01:25:51.010 --> 01:25:56.610
and, uh, Linda is taking it
very, very badly.

01:25:56.780 --> 01:25:58.940
Anything I can do?

01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:03.820
May I tell Linda you wanna see her?

01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:05.790
Of course,
if you think it would do any good.

01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:08.360
I know it would.

01:26:09.490 --> 01:26:14.990
- I'll bring her tomorrow.
- No, no, not yet. Not here.

01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:23.500
- When are you coming home?
- I don't know.

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:28.740
- A week, a month, a year?
- I don't know.

01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:35.510
Then I'll wait to hear from you.

01:26:37.650 --> 01:26:41.390
And just remember,
she won't be a little girl very long.

01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:36.870
- Mr. Wilson?
- Heh.

01:28:37.570 --> 01:28:39.010
What on earth are you doing?

01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:42.300
Just shut up
and get me a 7-foot sketch pad.

01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:44.670
- What?
- Go, go, go.

01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:50.220
Doctor. Doctor. Doctor.

01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:07.530
- Well, aren't you coming up with me?
- No, it's between the two of you.

01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:11.040
I'll pick you up by noon. Okay?

01:29:11.210 --> 01:29:16.510
- Do I have to?
- No, but I think you should.

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:34.960
Oh, it's open, come in.

01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:38.960
It's Linda.

01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:41.560
Oh, uh...

01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:45.510
- Hi, Linda, heh, how are you?
- My mother made me come.

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:46.700
What do you want?

01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:52.110
That's right, I forget. You're the one
that never beats around the bush.

01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:54.880
Okay, to talk about your father.

01:29:56.150 --> 01:30:02.090
Why? I didn't like him very much
if you wanna know.

01:30:02.260 --> 01:30:03.260
Oh.

01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:08.260
And he didn't like me either.
He was always going away.

01:30:08.430 --> 01:30:15.840
But he won't do it again
because he's dead. And I'm glad.

01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:17.300
What did you say?

01:30:18.410 --> 01:30:24.410
I said he's dead and I'm glad.

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:28.560
You sound like a woodpecker
banging against a tree. You know:

01:30:29.950 --> 01:30:31.550
Stop that!

01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:39.130
You're just like him! You laugh too.
All men are like that.

01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:42.690
I don't care. I don't care.

01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:45.930
- Close that door, Linda.
- I'm going.

01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:50.330
If you go out of here now,
you'll stammer until your teeth fall out.

01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:51.910
I won't...

01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:54.570
Who can understand that?

01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:55.770
Stop that.

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:58.390
Do you think someone is gonna
feel sorry for you, is that it?

01:30:58.550 --> 01:31:01.150
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat the rest of your life
like a stupid woodpecker?

01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:04.190
Don't say that.
Stop it, please. Stop it.

01:31:04.350 --> 01:31:07.470
I won't feel sorry for you. You might
as well start feeling sorry for yourself

01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:09.460
because nobody ever
stops stammering

01:31:09.630 --> 01:31:11.290
until they wanted
to stop stammering.

01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:16.530
Shut up, will you? Will you shut up?

01:31:20.670 --> 01:31:22.100
Sorry. I really am.

01:31:22.270 --> 01:31:24.970
I didn't mean to hit you,
honest, I didn't.

01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:27.270
Oh, yes, you did.

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:28.440
Oh.

01:31:29.780 --> 01:31:31.660
I don't know if it was worth it,
but it worked.

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:35.140
- What worked?
- You stopped stammering.

01:31:37.190 --> 01:31:38.210
Really?

01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:42.620
Up to a point.

01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:44.560
Are you sure you're all right?

01:31:44.730 --> 01:31:47.390
Oh, heh, fine.
I may never be the same.

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:49.500
I'm just fine.

01:31:50.430 --> 01:31:54.130
- Do you see a 7-foot easel over there?
- Sure, right there.

01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:55.700
Uh-huh.

01:32:02.610 --> 01:32:04.740
- What's on it?
- A book.

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:08.080
- A book?
- Yeah.

01:32:08.250 --> 01:32:11.220
It's a book that I promised
Howard Mann a long time ago

01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:13.860
but I never did get around
to finishing it

01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:15.790
until I got this idea
about your father.

01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:18.480
<i>- The Last Flower?</i>
- Yeah.

01:32:18.660 --> 01:32:20.490
That's about my father?

01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:26.470
Well, more about the way he thought,
why he always went away.

01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:30.770
- Why?
- Well, he knew something was wrong

01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:33.100
and he tried to fix it with his camera.

01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:37.150
In the end, you might say
he gave his life for an idea. Sort of.

01:32:39.850 --> 01:32:43.010
- What do you mean, "sort of"?
- The details don't...

01:32:43.190 --> 01:32:48.320
It's the thought that counts. It... Can
you read what's in the middle there?

01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:55.970
- "For Linda." For me?
- Yeah.

01:32:56.430 --> 01:33:01.130
"In the wistful hope that her world
will be better than mine."

01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:04.200
- I'm not sure I know what it means.
- Well, you will.

01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:05.470
Help me down with this.

01:33:11.850 --> 01:33:15.310
- Is that a picture of soldiers?
- Yes.

01:33:15.650 --> 01:33:17.090
- It's not very good.
- I know.

01:33:17.250 --> 01:33:20.120
Just read what it says, please.

01:33:20.290 --> 01:33:22.780
"World War XII,
as everybody knows,

01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:25.360
brought about the collapse
of civilization."

01:33:25.530 --> 01:33:27.790
Yeah, thanks.

01:33:30.570 --> 01:33:38.030
"Towns, cities and villages
disappeared from the Earth."

01:33:38.210 --> 01:33:43.700
- You mean everything was gone?
- Well, not exactly everything.

01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:46.610
There was one of these.

01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:53.080
Is that supposed to be a bird?

01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:55.350
If Michelangelo had you
looking over his shoulder,

01:33:55.530 --> 01:33:57.890
he never would have finished
that ceiling.

01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:04.460
As I was saying, "Towns, cities and
villages disappeared from the Earth.

01:34:04.630 --> 01:34:07.300
All the groves
and forests were destroyed.

01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:10.630
And all the gardens.
And all the works of art.

01:34:10.810 --> 01:34:11.810
Gee.

01:34:12.010 --> 01:34:15.640
Men, women and children
became lower than the lower animals.

01:34:15.810 --> 01:34:19.750
Emboldened by the pitiful condition
of the former lords of the Earth,

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:21.580
rabbits descended upon them."

01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:23.240
Look out!

01:34:30.230 --> 01:34:32.590
It's okay now.

01:34:35.770 --> 01:34:39.330
The books, paintings, music
disappeared from the Earth.

01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:42.900
Human beings sat around,
just doing nothing.

01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:44.730
Years and years went by.

01:34:44.910 --> 01:34:46.710
Even the few generals
that were left

01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:49.610
had forgotten
what the last war decided.

01:34:50.410 --> 01:34:54.320
Boys and girls grew up
to stare at each other blankly.

01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:56.950
Love had passed from the Earth.

01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:00.680
- Well, what about sex?
- It was on its way out.

01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:05.730
But one day, a young girl
who had never seen a flower in her life

01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:08.660
chanced to come upon
the last one in the world.

01:35:08.830 --> 01:35:13.570
Well, she told the other human beings
that the last flower was dying

01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:16.940
and the only one
that would pay any attention to her

01:35:17.110 --> 01:35:19.630
was a young man
that she met wandering about.

01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:23.000
Do they have any clothes on?
I can't tell.

01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:25.170
If you can't tell,
what difference does it make?

01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:28.280
Anyway, the young man and the girl
nurtured the flower

01:35:28.450 --> 01:35:30.580
and it began to live again.

01:35:36.990 --> 01:35:41.660
One day, a bee visited the flower
and a humming bird.

01:35:44.130 --> 01:35:48.900
Before long there were two flowers,
and then four.

01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:50.970
Then a great many.

01:35:51.670 --> 01:35:56.010
And the young girl began to take
an interest in how she looked.

01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:59.680
- All of a sudden she's developed.
- It'll be your turn soon.

01:35:59.850 --> 01:36:05.220
The young man discovered
that touching the girl was pleasurable.

01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:15.090
Oh, uh...

01:36:23.470 --> 01:36:26.000
Love was reborn into the world.

01:36:26.610 --> 01:36:31.210
The children grew up strong and
healthy and learned to run and laugh.

01:36:34.380 --> 01:36:36.610
The dogs came out of their exile.

01:36:39.790 --> 01:36:44.660
The dogs are just like the rabbits.
Rabbits don't look much like rabbits.

01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:48.660
- I do the best I can.
- I know.

01:36:49.770 --> 01:36:53.330
The young man discovered,
by putting one stone upon the other,

01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:55.600
how to build a shelter.

01:36:55.770 --> 01:36:59.260
Pretty soon
everybody was building shelters.

01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:03.170
Towns, villages, cities sprang up.

01:37:05.310 --> 01:37:07.340
Song came back in the world.

01:37:12.590 --> 01:37:14.320
And troubadours and jugglers.

01:37:16.390 --> 01:37:17.720
Boy, he's pretty good.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.060
Butter fingers.

01:37:22.230 --> 01:37:27.190
And painters and poets
and sculptors and wheelwrights.

01:37:30.410 --> 01:37:32.100
- And soldiers.
- Uh-oh.

01:37:43.150 --> 01:37:49.020
And lieutenants, captains, generals,
major generals.

01:37:49.190 --> 01:37:51.790
And liberators.

01:37:57.370 --> 01:38:00.630
Excuse me. Sorry.

01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:06.810
Now, some people went one place
to live and some another.

01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:08.980
Before long,
those who went to live in the valleys

01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:10.880
wished they'd gone
to live in the hills.

01:38:11.050 --> 01:38:12.650
Those that had gone
to live in the hills

01:38:12.750 --> 01:38:14.110
wished they'd gone
to the valleys.

01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:16.310
What about those
who went to live on Long Island?

01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:18.080
They got what they deserved.

01:38:18.250 --> 01:38:24.520
The liberators, under the guidance
of God, set fire to the discontent.

01:38:24.690 --> 01:38:27.390
So presently,
the world was at war again.

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:43.410
Only this time
the destruction was so complete,

01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:46.410
nothing at all was left in the world.

01:38:46.580 --> 01:38:51.890
- Nothing?
- Except one man.

01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:55.250
And one woman.

01:38:58.630 --> 01:39:00.490
And one flower.

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:08.670
I like it.

01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:10.970
And I think I understand.

01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:14.670
Well, that's about all
anybody could ask about anything.

01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:17.740
Of course,
these drawings aren't very good.

01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:22.250
- Worse than usual?
- No, they've never been very good.

01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:25.080
Well, at least that's encouraging, heh.

01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:29.490
When are you coming home?
David misses you.

01:39:30.590 --> 01:39:32.820
I don't know.
Maybe when you stop doing that

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.960
and I can learn
how to light somebody's cigarette

01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:37.230
without setting their head on fire.

01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:42.400
That's mother. I have to go.

01:39:43.570 --> 01:39:48.200
- Goodbye, Linda. Thanks for coming.
- Bye.

01:39:59.050 --> 01:40:01.520
Peter Piper
picked a peck of pickled peppers.

01:40:01.690 --> 01:40:05.490
If pickled peppers,

01:40:05.790 --> 01:40:09.490
where's the peck of pickled peppers
that Peter Piper picked?

01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:25.310
I don't have anything left
to give up for Lent.

01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:30.610
Nothing Norman Mailer has to say
is of the slightest interest to me.

01:40:30.790 --> 01:40:33.650
Howard, I've learned
not to mind being stared at.

01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:37.160
A little old lady helped me
across the street, I didn't even hit her.

01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:41.860
It seems like a very large
party for such a very small book.

01:40:42.030 --> 01:40:45.370
Well, here he is at last,
ladies and gentlemen, Peter Wilson.

01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:48.590
Peter, why don't you tell us a little bit
about how you work?

01:40:48.770 --> 01:40:50.970
- Uh, where that hidden well is.
- Well, I...

01:40:51.140 --> 01:40:54.010
How you get your inspiration
and all that stuff.

01:40:54.710 --> 01:40:57.810
I once knew a little girl
who stammered, but she stopped.

01:40:58.710 --> 01:41:02.210
- Now, what does that mean?
- Well, I don't know, but it helped me.

01:41:03.250 --> 01:41:07.350
Do you think your failing eyesight will be
a terrible handicap to you in the future?

01:41:08.290 --> 01:41:11.850
On the contrary, it's a godsend.
I can barely see you at all.

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:20.360
You asked Terry to come here?
Now I am gonna kill you.

01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:22.470
I did not ask her, I swear.

01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:24.800
I talked to her,
but did not ask her in so many words.

01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:26.740
- How do you know?
- I heard her laughing.

01:41:26.910 --> 01:41:28.390
What's the matter with you,
you deaf?

01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:31.220
What's the matter with you, you
stupid? Why haven't you called her?

01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:33.030
Because
I've got to prove something first.

01:41:33.150 --> 01:41:34.950
- What?
- That I don't need her for anything.

01:41:35.050 --> 01:41:37.520
Otherwise she'll hold it
over my head for the rest of my life.

01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:39.820
I'll wait till the book is a success
and then call her.

01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:41.960
Well, if she had any sense at all,
she'd leave you.

01:41:42.090 --> 01:41:44.790
You won't be the only idiot
on the bestseller list, you know.

01:41:50.900 --> 01:41:54.390
There you are, Mr. Wilson,
you don't know how thrilled I am.

01:41:54.570 --> 01:41:56.730
Would you mind autographing
your book for me, please?

01:41:56.910 --> 01:41:58.350
Someday
it might be worth something.

01:41:58.510 --> 01:42:00.700
There's always
that slender chance, heh.

01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:04.240
Would you write, "To Helen McInness,
of Pittsburgh, PA"?

01:42:04.410 --> 01:42:06.210
Would you, please?

01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:08.750
- Would you do me a favor?
- Of course.

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:13.050
Would you point me
to the nearest blank wall?

01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:18.160
- What?
- Find a wall and point me towards it.

01:42:18.330 --> 01:42:20.490
Well, there's one right over there.
You can't miss it.

01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:23.430
- Where?
- Right over there.

01:42:24.530 --> 01:42:26.260
Thanks, Helen.

01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:44.320
Hello.

01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:57.800
- What took you so long?
- I'm as stubborn as you are.

01:42:59.130 --> 01:43:00.800
- How's my drawing?
- Terrible.

01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:06.440
- Being obvious again.
- About what?

01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:12.180
I recognize the mating dance
when I see one.

01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:15.510
Come on.

01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:23.520
- You know what I like about you?
- What?

01:43:23.690 --> 01:43:25.160
You have absolutely no shame.

01:43:25.330 --> 01:43:27.230
- You know what I like about you?
- What?

01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:32.530
The operation didn't change you a bit.
You're still a mean, old son of a bitch.
