reconsider your stance on Ricky.

00:35.501 --> 00:37.125
I got bad news.
I couldn't make the deal.

00:37.209 --> 00:39.000
-They wanted too much money.
-If I was you,

00:39.084 --> 00:40.584
I'd figure out a way
to make the deal with them.

you're here

for that surf nightmare

02:56.292 --> 02:57.834
you sunk yourselves into.

02:57.918 --> 02:59.542
No, I have come here

02:59.626 --> 03:01.959
an opportunity
to become media titans.

03:02.042 --> 03:03.876

03:03.959 --> 03:06.125
I've seen fish tanks
more riveting.

03:06.209 --> 03:08.584
Exactly. Which is why
I'm rebranding it

03:08.668 --> 03:09.918

pivot back to football.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.709

NFL rights?

No. The NFL ratings
are taking a nosedive.
But you know what's not?

03:14.584 --> 03:16.709
- Mommy porn?
- College football, Bret.

03:16.793 --> 03:17.876
You should see somebody
about that.

03:17.959 --> 03:19.709
- So which college?
- USC.

03:19.793 --> 03:21.417
Pac-12 deal is ending,

03:21.501 --> 03:23.334
and we're gonna lock 'em down
with a bid they can't refuse.

03:23.417 --> 03:25.334
And how much are "we"
planning to bid?

03:25.417 --> 03:26.876
200 over ten years.

03:26.959 --> 03:28.834
- Come on.
- ( Bret laughs )

03:28.918 --> 03:30.501

200 million?

03:30.584 --> 03:33.209
That's the deal
you flew out here
to dazzle us with?

03:33.292 --> 03:35.626
- Julian: Where is the upside?
- The upside...

03:35.709 --> 03:38.417
is a billion-dollar secret
that I have been sitting on

03:38.501 --> 03:41.167
about the big, bright future
of their program.

03:41.250 --> 03:42.834
- Go on.
- Go on.

03:42.918 --> 03:45.542
What if I told you that
the greatest athlete
on the planet

03:45.626 --> 03:47.542
is gonna shock the world
with his decision.

03:47.626 --> 03:49.459
LeBron is goin' back to college.

03:49.542 --> 03:51.167
No, this is a new king.

03:51.250 --> 03:53.542
And guess how many people
know where he's headed?

03:53.626 --> 03:56.501
- Just you?
- Yeah, and it's gonna
stay that way.

03:56.584 --> 03:59.501
Billion-dollar insider info
right now, boys.

03:59.584 --> 04:00.668
Wow...

04:00.751 --> 04:03.334
that is floppin' around
in the mud.

04:03.417 --> 04:04.709
I knew you were dirty,

04:04.793 --> 04:06.125
I didn't know
you were this  dirty.

04:06.209 --> 04:07.709
Well, no dirtier
than the NCAA.

04:07.793 --> 04:09.918
You're not worried about
betting your name and future

04:10.000 --> 04:11.584

04:11.668 --> 04:13.834
Look at my face.
Do I look worried?

04:13.918 --> 04:17.959
The lawyer will be in touch
while I vet.

04:18.042 --> 04:19.125
Now get out.

04:20.376 --> 04:22.459
Like you both more
when you're medicated.

04:22.542 --> 04:24.209
- ( Spencer chuckles )
- Bret: I need that.

04:24.292 --> 04:25.584
I need to go. Oh, OK.

04:25.668 --> 04:27.000
Go deep, go deep.

04:28.834 --> 04:32.334
Yeah, well, whose
brilliant idea was it
to get them fried chicken

04:32.417 --> 04:34.125
like they're pigeons
in a park?

04:34.209 --> 04:36.751
Because I'm black
I'm supposed to know
about chicken?

04:36.834 --> 04:39.084
Jesse, hey, you have
that spreadsheet?

04:39.167 --> 04:40.876
Oh, OK, yeah,
I need one minute, too.

04:40.959 --> 04:42.417
Nobody listens to me
around here.

04:42.501 --> 04:44.459
More like everybody's
tired of listening to your ass.

04:44.542 --> 04:46.417

but we no longer rep--

04:46.501 --> 04:47.417
Hold on!

04:47.501 --> 04:49.542

call on hold.

04:49.626 --> 04:51.918
Who do we no longer rep,
and who is that on the phone?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.751
It's Yanni from Nike.

04:53.834 --> 04:56.668
He's calling
about Nyjah's avail
for a new campaign.

04:56.751 --> 04:58.376
Gimme that.
Gimme that!

05:00.292 --> 05:02.042
Hey, Yanni, my man.

05:02.125 --> 05:03.709
It's Joe Krutel.

05:03.793 --> 05:05.709
Joe! Joey! We know each other?

05:05.793 --> 05:07.250
I'm the new creative director

05:07.334 --> 05:09.459
and owner of Sports X.

05:09.542 --> 05:11.584
Um, how can I help you?

05:11.668 --> 05:13.668
- What do you need?
- I gotta get with Nyjah.

05:13.751 --> 05:15.709
I got an idea for
a dope new SB campaign,

05:15.793 --> 05:17.626
but I gotta move quick.
Is he around and avail?

05:17.709 --> 05:19.042
Oh, God, unfortunately

05:19.125 --> 05:20.751
that's both great and awful.

05:20.834 --> 05:22.542
He's not. Um...

05:22.626 --> 05:24.417
he had a death in the family.

05:24.501 --> 05:25.584
- No!
- Yeah.

05:25.668 --> 05:27.334
You know his Weimaraner, Bobby?

05:27.417 --> 05:28.626
- Not Bobby!
- Yeah. Bobby got hit

05:28.709 --> 05:30.042
by a garbage truck.

05:30.125 --> 05:32.459
- He is no more.
- Dude! That's awful.

05:32.542 --> 05:34.709
Maybe I can
send him something.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.751
Uh, no. I don't think
you should.

05:36.834 --> 05:38.876
It'll only reopen the wounds.

05:38.959 --> 05:41.417
- Know what I mean?
- Fuck! I feel bad for the kid.

05:41.501 --> 05:43.417
And the dog.
But I gotta jump.

05:43.501 --> 05:45.334
I gotta chase down
another piece of talent.

05:45.417 --> 05:48.125
Well, maybe I can
help with that.

05:48.209 --> 05:49.459
Who else ya got?

05:49.542 --> 05:53.918
What if you do less of
a star-centric face campaign

05:54.000 --> 05:56.042
and it's more about
a cultural revolution,

05:56.125 --> 05:58.376
- a whole clique.
- OK, what clique?

05:58.459 --> 06:00.292
Illegal Civilization.

06:00.376 --> 06:01.918
( laughs ) Come on, man.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.250
Those kids are animals.

06:03.334 --> 06:04.834
You know they upper-decked
the Puma offices

06:04.918 --> 06:06.584
when Lance brought them in
for a general?

06:06.668 --> 06:08.834
That was before
we put them through

06:08.918 --> 06:10.918
our specialized
finishing school.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.626
- No shit?
- For real.

06:12.709 --> 06:14.834
I would not lie to you.
You're too important
to our business.

06:14.918 --> 06:16.501
Are they around
for a meet?

06:16.584 --> 06:18.751
Yeah. Why don't you come by
the office today.

06:18.834 --> 06:21.167
- I'm already there, Joe.
- Great.

06:21.250 --> 06:22.459

You grow webs on your feet
or somethin'?

06:46.292 --> 06:47.793
You smashed
your own PB.

06:47.876 --> 06:50.459
Just motivated
by the money, Pops.
Same as always.

06:50.542 --> 06:52.209
That better be
all that's pushin' you.

06:52.292 --> 06:53.542
What'd you say?

06:53.626 --> 06:55.167
I'm just sayin'
what I'm sayin'.

06:55.250 --> 06:58.125
My body's a temple.
Always has been,
always will be.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.626
Baby. Get ready,
we got a barbecue
with the Whites.

07:00.709 --> 07:03.334
Now, why has it always
gotta be about race, sweetie?

07:03.417 --> 07:05.167
No, Pops, that's their name.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.167
The Whites.
The Whites' barbecue?

07:07.250 --> 07:10.501
We barbecuin' white folks now?

07:10.584 --> 07:12.250
You better get you
some of that spicy-ass rub,

07:12.334 --> 07:14.042
'cause you know
that white meat
ain't as flavorful

07:14.125 --> 07:16.417
- as this dark meat, baby.
- Who says you even rollin'?

07:16.501 --> 07:17.751
Come on, man,
you gotta let me go!

07:17.834 --> 07:19.334
Who the hell
are the Whites, anyway?

07:19.417 --> 07:20.751
Some tech dude.
Made an app

07:20.834 --> 07:22.125
that matches dogs
for playdates.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.250
So, like Tinder for dogs?

07:24.334 --> 07:25.876
Yeah, but they always
down to fuck.

07:25.959 --> 07:29.209
Damn, man! People keep
stealin' all my good ideas!

07:29.292 --> 07:31.584
For real!
Bullshit.

07:31.668 --> 07:34.250
Sounds like those skate brats
are runnin' you ragged, huh?

07:34.334 --> 07:37.042
Dude, it's like
herding stoned cats.

07:37.125 --> 07:39.000
If I could track down
these little fuckers,

07:39.084 --> 07:40.709
at least the payoff
will be worth it.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.959
You know, Joseph, it sounds
like you found your calling.

07:43.042 --> 07:46.501
- God, I hope not.
How'd it go with the brothers?
- It's all good.

07:46.584 --> 07:49.000
They just texted me they are in.
Money in the bank,
and ready to play.

07:49.084 --> 07:50.084
That's great news.

07:50.167 --> 07:51.417
Meanwhile, I'll be here

07:51.501 --> 07:53.292
steering the ship
away from the iceberg.

07:53.376 --> 07:54.668
Hey! No, no, no, no.

07:54.751 --> 07:56.584
Those aren't the new design.
Take 'em back.

07:56.668 --> 07:58.459
- Throw those out.
- Be the iceberg, Joseph.

07:58.542 --> 08:01.084
- Be the iceberg.
- What does that even mean?

08:01.167 --> 08:04.626
It means...
I don't know
what the fuck it means.

08:04.709 --> 08:06.376
I can tell you this:
When it's all said and done,

08:06.459 --> 08:07.959
you and I are gonna

08:56.250 --> 08:58.167
- Yo, who this?
- You know who this is.

08:58.250 --> 09:00.834
- Where the hell you been?
- Just gettin' dirty
on these ATVs.

09:00.918 --> 09:02.501
You gotta come
try it next time.

09:02.584 --> 09:04.501
It'll get you right.
What up?

09:04.584 --> 09:06.125
Ohio State, Q, Ohio State.

09:06.209 --> 09:07.709
- That's what up.
- Oh, that.

09:07.793 --> 09:10.209
Yeah. I guess I told 'em
what they wanted to hear,

09:10.292 --> 09:12.042
like everyone else
who flashin' me love.

09:12.125 --> 09:14.084
- You feel me?
- Everyone who?

09:14.167 --> 09:16.042
Not you. But Unc,

09:16.125 --> 09:17.793
I met LeBron at The Shoe.

09:17.876 --> 09:20.167
This dude's mad charming.
I mean, he still text me.

09:20.250 --> 09:21.584
What am I supposed to do?

09:21.668 --> 09:23.042
You don't say no
to the King.

09:23.125 --> 09:24.542
Yes, Q, you do.

09:24.626 --> 09:26.876
In this case you say no.
You say hell no.

09:26.959 --> 09:29.084
I told him I'd love to go there
before you came back

09:29.167 --> 09:31.334
on the scene with all your
suss-ass deals and shit.

09:31.417 --> 09:34.542
But that's old news.
Last I heard, we're waiting
till Signing Day.

09:34.626 --> 09:36.542
Shit, they must have
heard about our trip
to USC

09:36.626 --> 09:38.751
- and leaked it.
- That's fucked.

09:38.834 --> 09:41.501
Yes, it is, Q. Massively.
It's about to sink our deal.

09:41.584 --> 09:44.292
Do you understand that?
This is your money
we're talking about.

09:44.376 --> 09:46.334
You wanted me in
on this deal, I'm in.

09:46.417 --> 09:48.584
But if you got loose ends
you gotta take care of,

09:48.668 --> 09:50.709
you gotta take care of 'em.

09:50.793 --> 09:52.250
Hear me?

09:52.334 --> 09:54.542
We gotta make a quick stop
to Columbus.

10:04.292 --> 10:07.042
Oh, yeah.

10:07.125 --> 10:09.501
Mmm. Mmm.

10:16.376 --> 10:18.125
Man: Oh....

10:20.209 --> 10:22.042
( clinking )

10:24.918 --> 10:26.042
Hmm.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.084
So, were you in the league, too?

10:28.167 --> 10:31.250
Yeah, CFL.
It's in Canadia.

10:31.334 --> 10:34.459
Oh, really?
We just bought a lake house
in Vancouver.

10:34.542 --> 10:35.793
- Word?
- Yeah.

10:35.876 --> 10:37.709
You and Ricky
are welcome anytime.

10:37.793 --> 10:39.000
Thank you?

10:39.084 --> 10:42.793
Is it all isolated?
Like no one can hear you scream?

10:42.876 --> 10:45.334
You see, most people
don't realize that...

10:45.417 --> 10:48.542
all of the energy's generated
from the lower body...

10:48.626 --> 10:50.793
and that you gotta
sort of explode...

10:50.876 --> 10:52.125
- Oh!
- ...from the hips.

10:52.209 --> 10:53.459
( both laugh )

10:53.542 --> 10:55.042
Well, now I can see where

10:55.125 --> 10:56.668
your handsome son gets it from.

10:56.751 --> 11:00.084
Oh, honey, I only
gave him half of it.

11:01.751 --> 11:03.751
Joyce White:
He's only been in for a year.

11:03.834 --> 11:05.459
- We have to give him time.
- Ricky: Right.

11:05.542 --> 11:09.417
I mean, sure,
Trump is an eccentric,

11:09.501 --> 11:12.042
but so were so many
of our great leaders.

11:12.125 --> 11:14.334
Imagine if Lincoln
had Twitter.

11:14.417 --> 11:15.584
- ( laughter )
- What?

11:15.668 --> 11:18.334
Or Teddy Roosevelt
had Snapchat.

11:18.417 --> 11:20.042
But he is moving us forward,

11:20.125 --> 11:21.918
and the rest is just noise.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.084
I just mean you have to
look at what he's doing
for people like us.

11:25.167 --> 11:26.834
- Like us?
- Yeah!

11:26.918 --> 11:30.501
- Yeah, like us.
- Yeah, successful,
self-made Americans.

11:30.584 --> 11:32.834
Don't hate us for
wanting to keep our money,
right?

11:32.918 --> 11:34.125
Jerry: Yeah, come on.
We work hard,

11:34.209 --> 11:35.959
( sing-songy )
we got rich as fuck

11:36.042 --> 11:38.042
on the backs of
our own sweat and tears,

11:38.125 --> 11:41.334
and he wants to let
people like us keep
the fruits of our labor.

11:41.417 --> 11:43.584
I think that's something
that the whole country
can get behind.

11:43.668 --> 11:45.250
Lookit, we didn't ask
for any handouts.

11:45.334 --> 11:48.000
We did it by grinding it out,
and so can everybody else.

11:48.084 --> 11:50.459
Yeah, I can see the calluses
on your hands.

11:50.542 --> 11:52.167
( all laugh )

11:52.250 --> 11:54.167
That's what I love about you,
Rick.

11:54.250 --> 11:56.959
You get it.
A lot of you don't.

11:58.751 --> 12:00.584
I get it. You got me.

12:00.668 --> 12:03.793
Ricky Jerret is exactly
who he needs.

12:05.918 --> 12:07.793
What? No, you gotta speak up.

12:07.876 --> 12:10.501
Sounds like you got
bad reception up your ass.

12:10.584 --> 12:13.292
Why don't you hit me back
once you pull your head
out of it.

12:13.376 --> 12:14.542
Jerk.

12:14.626 --> 12:17.042
- There she is. Hey, baby.
- Hey, baby.

12:17.125 --> 12:18.918
You couldn't pick your wife up
from the airport?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.876
Mother of your child,
queen of your kingdom?

12:20.959 --> 12:22.250
I wanted to pick you up,

12:22.334 --> 12:24.668
it's just that Gurley's
vampire of an agent

12:24.751 --> 12:26.709
just called to renegotiate
his contract a year early.

12:26.793 --> 12:28.000
Just got things
all shaken up.

12:28.084 --> 12:30.417
Yeah? Well, the 405
got me shook. OK?

12:30.501 --> 12:31.751
It can do that.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.542
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

12:33.626 --> 12:35.167
You matter. It's OK.

12:35.250 --> 12:37.334
I should have picked you up,
I know that.

12:37.417 --> 12:39.250
- Yeah, you should have.
- Now, Mrs. Greane,

12:39.334 --> 12:42.876
can you please
formally accept my apology?

12:42.959 --> 12:44.417
- Hmm?
- Yes, I do.

12:44.501 --> 12:45.918
OK. Thank you.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.584
I'm only gonna be
in L.A. one night

12:47.668 --> 12:49.417
before I go to
my conference in Vegas.

12:49.501 --> 12:51.250
Today was supposed
to be about us.

12:51.334 --> 12:52.918
I know. I see all of it.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.250
It's just that I have
to do this one thing, OK?

12:55.334 --> 12:57.709
It's not gonna take forever.
How about...

12:57.793 --> 12:59.250
you go get a massage?

12:59.334 --> 13:01.417
And then maybe
you hit the shops?

13:01.501 --> 13:03.668
By then I'll be done,
I'll come make it up
to you tonight.

13:03.751 --> 13:06.292
- How's that sound? Yeah?
- OK. Yeah.

13:06.376 --> 13:07.417
Mmm.

13:07.501 --> 13:10.084
Gimme some of that.
I love you, my queen.

13:10.167 --> 13:12.542
Love you, my king.
All right. Bye.

Oh, shit! You're back.

13:51.501 --> 13:52.959
Yeah, we're back.

13:53.042 --> 13:54.751
That's crazy.
Nobody ever comes back.

13:59.584 --> 14:01.209
Oh, yeah?
How you gonna do that?

14:01.292 --> 14:04.626
Well, for starters,
we got you a meeting
with Nike today.

14:04.709 --> 14:06.417
You ever heard
of fuckin' Nike?

14:06.501 --> 14:08.668
Yeah, they make
real fuckin' sneakers.

14:08.751 --> 14:10.501
Yeah, they're
chompin' at the bit

14:10.584 --> 14:12.334
to get some of that
Illegal Civ magic

14:12.417 --> 14:14.250
all up in them
corporate guts.

14:14.334 --> 14:16.709
I mean, yeah.
I like what they up to.

14:16.793 --> 14:18.209
Like with SB
and all that.

14:18.292 --> 14:20.751
Oh, yeah, yeah?
You like what they're up to?

14:20.834 --> 14:22.084
You approve
of their business model?

14:22.167 --> 14:23.334
All right, good.
Unless you wanna be

14:23.417 --> 14:25.751
drinkin' whatever
the fuck that is

14:25.834 --> 14:28.668
and eatin' your dinner out of
cans when you're my fuckin' age,

14:28.751 --> 14:30.501
you'll get
your shit together

14:30.584 --> 14:32.501
and let us
cash you in

14:32.584 --> 14:33.959
before you're yesterday's meme.

14:34.042 --> 14:36.668
I like that. Uncle Fester
came to play today,

14:36.751 --> 14:38.376
- OK?
- ( laughter )

14:38.459 --> 14:40.292
- Every damn day.
- Yeah.

14:41.584 --> 14:43.334
What the fuck
is that shit?

14:43.417 --> 14:45.125
( laughter )

14:45.209 --> 14:46.334
What, you don't like E&J?

14:46.417 --> 14:48.626
E&J? I like B&J.

14:48.709 --> 14:50.376
This is like
fuckin' pee and J.

14:50.459 --> 14:51.876
( cup clatters )

14:51.959 --> 14:54.042
We're sending a car at four.

14:54.125 --> 14:56.167
Make sure
you're fuckin' ready.

15:01.751 --> 15:03.709
Jerry:
It must be weird, huh?

15:03.793 --> 15:05.709
Being retired
at such a young age.

15:05.793 --> 15:07.542
Well, I might surprise you
on that front.

15:07.626 --> 15:09.209
Seriously?

15:09.292 --> 15:10.167
Oh!

15:10.250 --> 15:12.084
Oh, breaking news.

15:12.167 --> 15:14.250
All right, hey,
lips are sealed.

15:15.584 --> 15:18.334
Uh-oh, somebody
call Jerry Jones.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.709
- We got a kneeler!
- ( laughter )

15:20.793 --> 15:22.250
Oh, dude.

15:22.334 --> 15:23.876
Let's respect
the movement, OK?

15:23.959 --> 15:25.250
Oh, the movement.

15:25.334 --> 15:26.626
You got a problem
with athletes

15:26.709 --> 15:27.918
speaking their mind
or something?

15:28.000 --> 15:29.542
No, not on their own time.

15:29.626 --> 15:31.084
Just don't drag
the flag into it.

15:31.167 --> 15:32.584
Y'all made it
about the flag.

15:32.668 --> 15:33.834
Who's "y'all"?

15:33.918 --> 15:35.542
- ( laughter )
- All right, easy.

15:35.626 --> 15:38.417
I do have
a serious question,
though, for you.

15:38.501 --> 15:41.459
If you go back out there,
you gonna kneel?

15:41.542 --> 15:44.084
Listen, do me a favor,
let's change the subject,

15:44.167 --> 15:45.125
- OK, fellas?
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

15:45.209 --> 15:46.584
Are you a politician now?

15:46.668 --> 15:48.584
Come on, we're all
on the same level here.

15:48.668 --> 15:50.042
You can tell us.
Come on.

15:50.125 --> 15:52.167
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, you would.

15:52.250 --> 15:53.876
- Oh! You're gonna kneel!
- You totally would!

15:53.959 --> 15:55.584
- I knew it!
- You would fucking kneel!

15:55.668 --> 15:58.084
You damn right I'd kneel,
motherfucker!

15:58.167 --> 16:00.626
And I'd kneel every Sunday.
Know I'm sayin'? Fuck Trump!

16:00.709 --> 16:02.209
Fuck that racist-ass bitch!

16:02.292 --> 16:03.793
- Whoa, holy shit.
- OK, that's--

16:03.876 --> 16:06.668
Listen, man, you gotta
respect the office, Ricky.

16:06.751 --> 16:08.876
- Where's our respect?!
- He's your president too, man.

16:08.959 --> 16:10.959
Where the fuck
is our respect, huh?!

16:11.042 --> 16:12.626
- What are you
talking about?
- My people. That's right!

16:12.709 --> 16:13.918
- I'm sorry, excuse me.
- My people!

16:14.000 --> 16:15.292
This is not
about race!

16:15.376 --> 16:18.376
My mother raised me--
a single mother on welfare.

16:18.459 --> 16:20.292
Government cheese
and white bread.

16:20.376 --> 16:21.626
And I'm here because I got

16:21.709 --> 16:24.292
some assistance
when I needed it.

16:24.376 --> 16:26.250
OK, you're an exception.

16:26.334 --> 16:28.292
That's right,
I am an exception.

16:28.376 --> 16:30.125
So fuck you.

16:30.209 --> 16:32.209
( people murmuring )

16:37.751 --> 16:40.209
- ( phone chiming )
- ( Spencer groans )

16:44.084 --> 16:45.501
What's up, brother?

16:45.584 --> 16:47.626
Jason:
Where are you?

16:47.709 --> 16:49.501
Oh, sunny SoCal.

16:49.584 --> 16:50.834
Yeah, me too.

16:50.918 --> 16:52.501
You got a minute
to link up later?

16:52.584 --> 16:54.125
Know what, I don't.
I'm slammed...

16:54.209 --> 16:55.751
right now.
Is it important
or can it wait?

16:55.834 --> 16:57.292
Oh, I'm just curious.

16:57.376 --> 16:59.125
Look, I don't judge you
for that curiosity, brother.

16:59.209 --> 17:00.209
- ( laughs )
- No, I'm not

17:00.292 --> 17:01.668
curious about myself,
Strasmore.

17:01.751 --> 17:03.376
I'm curious about you
and the Andersons.

17:03.459 --> 17:05.834
Word on the street is that
they're trying to make a deal

17:05.918 --> 17:07.209
for USC's TV rights.

17:07.292 --> 17:09.376
You know anything about that?

17:09.459 --> 17:10.709
No, not a thing.

17:10.793 --> 17:12.584
But, look, those guys
have their own agenda,

17:12.668 --> 17:14.417
and you don't need me
to tell you what color it is.

17:14.501 --> 17:16.167
Where'd you hear that from,
anyway?

17:16.250 --> 17:17.250
Dan Davis.

17:19.793 --> 17:22.000
- ( whispers ) Fuck.
- Say something.
'Cause Dan did.

17:22.084 --> 17:23.542
He asked me
what I thought about you.

17:23.626 --> 17:25.709
I vouched.
I told him you were solid.

17:25.793 --> 17:28.876
- I appreciate that.
- I told him you were
a stand-up guy.

17:28.959 --> 17:30.918
But, obviously, I lied.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.376
You got your nose
buried in a new pile

17:33.459 --> 17:34.626
but on a different coast.

17:34.709 --> 17:35.959
You know, with you,

17:36.042 --> 17:38.626
the story is always
the fuckin' same.

17:38.709 --> 17:40.709
I just better not hear the name

17:40.793 --> 17:41.959
"Quincy Crawford" mentioned.

17:42.042 --> 17:43.042
Hey, come on.

17:43.125 --> 17:44.167
I wouldn't do that to you, J.

17:44.250 --> 17:45.876
Let me remind you just in case

17:45.959 --> 17:47.376
you are having memory problems,

17:47.459 --> 17:48.751
which you so clearly are,

17:48.834 --> 17:51.918
he better come out
of this thing clean,

17:52.000 --> 17:53.793
or I am coming for you,
big man.

17:54.876 --> 17:56.250
( disconnects )

18:04.292 --> 18:06.501
Hey. Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

18:06.584 --> 18:08.709
Any time, Mr. Strasmore.

18:08.793 --> 18:11.334
We're always happy to have
a legend in these halls,

18:11.417 --> 18:12.417
even if they did choose

18:12.501 --> 18:13.584
the wrong school
back in the day.

18:13.668 --> 18:14.793
Well, you live
and learn, right?

18:14.876 --> 18:16.459
You do, you do.
Have a seat, please.

18:16.542 --> 18:18.209
- Thank you, Tom.
- Please. Sorry...

18:18.292 --> 18:19.626
Urban couldn't make it,

18:19.709 --> 18:21.250
but he's out
rustling the bushes,

18:21.334 --> 18:22.834
- if you know
what I mean.
- I do.

18:22.918 --> 18:24.751
Left me in charge
of the nuthouse.

18:24.834 --> 18:26.834
( laughs ) Right, well,
I'll make it quick, Todd.

18:26.918 --> 18:28.751
I'm here on behalf
of Quincy Crawford.

18:28.834 --> 18:30.167
Oh. You're friends?

18:30.250 --> 18:31.668
Well, I'm his uncle.

18:31.751 --> 18:33.417
( laughing ) Really?
Uncle Spencer?

18:33.501 --> 18:36.084
- Uncle Spencie.
- ( both laughing )

18:36.167 --> 18:37.959
Well, Q's family
is our family.

18:38.042 --> 18:41.000
I'm happy to hear that,
because any time
you hear bad news,

18:41.084 --> 18:42.876
you always wanna hear it
from somebody you love.

18:42.959 --> 18:44.751
- Am I right?
- Excuse me?

18:44.834 --> 18:46.417
Todd, I'm gonna
shoot straight with ya.

18:46.501 --> 18:49.292
Like LeBron, Q is gonna
take his talents elsewhere.

18:49.376 --> 18:52.793
He's looking for
a more suitable environment
in terms of his education,

18:52.876 --> 18:54.376
and he needs to be
closer to home.

18:54.459 --> 18:56.042
Is that right?

18:56.125 --> 18:57.334
Sad to say, it is.

18:57.417 --> 18:59.000
He feels terrible
about this whole thing,

18:59.084 --> 19:01.376
and, you know, under it all,
he's just a shy kid

19:01.459 --> 19:02.709
who doesn't wanna
disappoint anybody,

19:02.793 --> 19:04.125
so he asked me
to come up here

19:04.209 --> 19:06.209
and see you face to face
to deliver the news.

19:06.292 --> 19:08.000
Well, I'm sorry to hear it,

19:08.084 --> 19:10.209
and Urban will be
even more sorry.

19:10.292 --> 19:12.459
Tell Urban that Saban
was even sorrier,

19:12.542 --> 19:13.959
but there's only
one kid to go around.

19:14.042 --> 19:15.167
- Right?
- Mm.

19:17.501 --> 19:20.709
Well, thanks for coming by
to let us know in person.

19:20.793 --> 19:23.084
We are sad to lose him,

19:23.167 --> 19:25.459
but understand
these things

19:25.542 --> 19:27.542
are personal matters,
and there's

19:27.626 --> 19:29.626
- so much to consider.
- Look, Todd, I'm sorry

19:29.709 --> 19:31.167
to be the bearer
of bad news,

19:31.250 --> 19:33.167
but I'm really happy
we have a good understanding.

19:33.250 --> 19:35.042
Of course. Uh, Jeannie
will make sure you have

19:35.125 --> 19:36.668
the proper directions
to the airport.

19:36.751 --> 19:37.918
I'm good, flying private.
Thank you.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.084
Oh, right!
Yeah, you Miami boys

19:40.167 --> 19:41.751
love your bling.
Am I right?

19:50.751 --> 19:53.918
We know you're looking
for targeted saturation,

19:54.000 --> 19:56.918
and-and a truly
grassroots campaign.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.334
Well, these kids--

19:59.417 --> 20:01.459
uh, these kids...

20:01.542 --> 20:04.668
come ready with that
target demographic following.

20:04.751 --> 20:08.834
We're bringing you
ready-made, authentic vibe.

20:08.918 --> 20:11.376
I mean, you can't manufacture
this in a marketing lab.

20:11.459 --> 20:12.834
Authenticity is key.

20:12.918 --> 20:14.709
- Yeah.
- We're still
wiping the yolk

20:14.793 --> 20:16.918
from our face
from the Bella Hadid campaign.

20:18.417 --> 20:19.834
I liked that campaign.

20:19.918 --> 20:21.042
Reggie, we did too,

20:21.125 --> 20:22.250
but the people spoke,

20:22.334 --> 20:23.876
and when they speak,
we listen.

20:23.959 --> 20:25.876
- Oh, man.
- Yo, Ryder, you good?

20:25.959 --> 20:28.417
- I don't think so.
- Uh, do you guys
need a break?

20:28.501 --> 20:30.376
- Fuck, fuck.
- You all right, man?

20:30.459 --> 20:32.334
It's fine, it's fine.
They just had
too many Red Bulls,

20:32.417 --> 20:34.459
- I think.
- ( kids retching )

20:38.417 --> 20:39.584
What the fuck?!

20:39.668 --> 20:40.876
( retching continues )

20:40.959 --> 20:42.709
- What the fuck?!
- Oh!

20:42.793 --> 20:44.918
No, no, no.
Come on, guys,
guys, guys.

20:47.334 --> 20:49.209
( kids laughing )

20:49.292 --> 20:52.793
Joe:
Oh, what the fuck?!

20:52.876 --> 20:55.334
Oh, come on!

20:56.584 --> 20:57.417
Oh, no!

20:57.501 --> 20:59.501
( kids laughing )

21:03.793 --> 21:06.334
Dennis: What the hell's
the matter with you?

21:06.417 --> 21:07.793
You tryin' to get your ass
kicked out the neighborhood

21:07.876 --> 21:09.042
before you even get settled?

21:09.125 --> 21:10.459
Yeah, I'd like
to see 'em try that.

21:10.542 --> 21:13.167
Our baby has to go to school
with their kids, Ricky.

21:13.250 --> 21:14.793
You ever think about that?

21:14.876 --> 21:17.084
I have to see
these people
every damn day.

21:17.167 --> 21:18.959
Shit, why can't you
just be polite?

21:19.042 --> 21:20.876
Fuck being polite!
That man was talkin' to me

21:20.959 --> 21:22.334
like I ain't got no love
for my community.

21:22.417 --> 21:23.793
This is your
community, boy!

21:23.876 --> 21:25.751
You clearly
gonna have to

21:25.834 --> 21:26.918
up your dosage, Ricky.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.501
I mean, you're
acting erratic.

21:28.584 --> 21:30.876
You're emotional.
It's like you got
a shorter fuse.

21:30.959 --> 21:32.250
You my damn shrink
now too, man?

21:32.334 --> 21:33.959
You wouldn't know
a fuckin' shrink

21:34.042 --> 21:35.459
if it jumped out the ocean
and bit you on your dick!

21:35.542 --> 21:38.125
Amber: All right,
look, calm down.

21:38.209 --> 21:40.334
Baby, things are different
here, all right?

21:40.417 --> 21:42.459
Sometimes we gotta
keep our causes to ourselves.

21:42.542 --> 21:44.626
- We're not asking you
to change how you feel.
- Oh, God.

21:44.709 --> 21:46.292
I can't believe y'all!

21:46.376 --> 21:47.709
Oh, you wanna
end up like Kaep.

21:47.793 --> 21:49.376
Well, that man
led a movement.

21:49.459 --> 21:51.959
What are people
gonna remember me for?

21:52.042 --> 21:53.250
Or you, old man?

21:53.334 --> 21:55.209
Look, a legacy is earned

21:55.292 --> 21:58.292
on the field, in the grass
between the chains,

21:58.376 --> 21:59.834
not by running
your goddamn mouth.

21:59.918 --> 22:02.709
So shut it before it costs you
more than you can cover.

22:02.793 --> 22:04.292
Baby, we support you,
just--

22:04.376 --> 22:06.209
Just not really, though.

22:10.042 --> 22:11.376
Told you
he was sensitive.

22:11.459 --> 22:13.918
- TTD, shut the fuck up.
- Every time.

22:23.250 --> 22:25.250
( Twitter whistle )

22:32.584 --> 22:33.834
Julie:
Hey, baby.

22:33.918 --> 22:35.459
Hey.

22:35.542 --> 22:37.793
Look what I got.

22:37.876 --> 22:39.918
Look at this!
Couldn't you just die?

22:40.000 --> 22:42.834
Damn, baby,
you leave anything
up in the stores?

22:42.918 --> 22:44.834
You probably ran through
Kiki's college fund.

22:44.918 --> 22:46.584
Boy, please, you know
she gettin' a scholarship.

22:46.668 --> 22:48.376
- ( Charles laughs )
- Plus, I had
to do something

22:48.459 --> 22:50.459
with all my unexpected
free time.

22:50.542 --> 22:52.542
I'm sorry, baby.

22:53.709 --> 22:55.751
But it just doesn't stop!

22:55.834 --> 22:57.626
The contracts, the emails,

22:57.709 --> 22:59.793
this guy's ego,
that guy's torn ACL.

22:59.876 --> 23:02.918
- Popcorn vendors.
- You need to relax.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.542
I can't. I can't do it.

23:05.626 --> 23:06.959
( grunts )

23:08.709 --> 23:12.959
Ya know,
I just feel like
I'm failin' everybody

23:13.042 --> 23:15.334
all the time.

23:15.417 --> 23:17.876
The organization,
the players,

23:17.959 --> 23:20.209
my friends...

23:20.292 --> 23:22.542
and most importantly,
you and Kiki.

23:22.626 --> 23:24.334
Why would you say that?

23:24.417 --> 23:27.501
Because look at this!

23:27.584 --> 23:28.959
Is this our life now?

23:31.250 --> 23:35.125
No, I brought us out here
thinkin' I was onto something,

23:35.209 --> 23:37.042
- I thought--
- What you thought is,

23:37.125 --> 23:39.668
you thought you were gonna
finally be the boss.

23:39.751 --> 23:41.918
You were gonna
fulfill your destiny.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.584
Remember when you were
worried about down payments

23:44.668 --> 23:46.918
and GPS add-ons
at the dealership?

23:47.000 --> 23:49.918
Yes. Much simpler time.
Doesn't seem so bad now.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.668
You were afraid to fail then,
and now you're afraid
to succeed.

23:54.209 --> 23:56.084
Not havin' you and Kiki
out here

23:56.167 --> 23:58.250
is really wearin' me down.

23:58.334 --> 24:01.292
I don't know
if I can keep doin' it.

24:01.376 --> 24:05.167
It's like sometimes
I feel like I'm half a man
or somethin'.

24:05.250 --> 24:09.376
Oh, Mr. Greane.
You are a lot of things...

24:09.459 --> 24:12.167
but half a man
ain't one of 'em.

24:12.250 --> 24:13.834
That's a full man.

24:13.918 --> 24:15.584
( squeals, laughs )

24:15.668 --> 24:17.376
- Feel this full...
- ( phone chimes )

24:17.459 --> 24:19.084
man... of yours...

24:19.167 --> 24:20.709
- ( phone chimes )
- ...go to work.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.000
You see Andrew anywhere?

24:22.084 --> 24:23.459
Julie:
No. He wasn't out there.

24:23.542 --> 24:25.626
Charles:
OK, well, that's...

24:25.709 --> 24:27.584
Let's clear off
this desk...

24:27.668 --> 24:29.459
Radio commentator: ...another
incredible class of athletes

24:29.542 --> 24:31.793
- to look at again this year.
- ( phone chiming )

24:31.876 --> 24:33.459
Julian, what can I
do for you?

24:33.542 --> 24:35.876
The kid's incredible.

24:35.959 --> 24:37.542
He's once in a generation.

24:37.626 --> 24:40.250
I made it 250
to take it off the table.

24:40.334 --> 24:42.626
Smart move.
You won't regret it.

24:42.709 --> 24:45.334
- J, I gotta run.
- Hey--

24:46.959 --> 24:49.542
( siren bleats )

24:52.542 --> 24:54.084
( thunder rumbling )

25:06.584 --> 25:08.584
Evenin', Mr. Strasmore.

25:11.042 --> 25:12.876
( chuckles ) OK.

25:12.959 --> 25:14.668
Is there a problem,
Officer?

25:14.751 --> 25:16.918
Cop:
I sure hope not.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.417
You wanna step out
of the vehicle,
Mr. Strasmore?

25:19.501 --> 25:21.834
And why would I
want to do that?

25:21.918 --> 25:25.084
Because we asked you
so damn nice.

25:25.167 --> 25:27.250
( police dog panting )

25:28.834 --> 25:30.250
( dog barks )

25:30.334 --> 25:33.876
- ( dog growls )
- Spencer: Oh...

25:33.959 --> 25:36.042
so you think I'd bomb
my own plane, huh?

25:36.125 --> 25:38.376
That's Trigger.
He's not so much on bombs,

25:38.459 --> 25:40.334
but he likes him some drugs.

25:40.417 --> 25:42.501
By that, I mean
he likes findin' 'em.

25:42.584 --> 25:44.876
We've had a lot of problems
with private flights

25:44.959 --> 25:47.417
transportin' cash
and narcotics lately.

25:47.501 --> 25:50.042
We're just gonna take
a little peek in your rental
before you go.

25:50.125 --> 25:52.459
- Sure.
- ( dog barks, growls )

25:55.542 --> 25:57.125
( chuckling )

25:57.209 --> 25:58.876
I got a script for those.

25:58.959 --> 26:00.751
That's a lot of pills
for one man.

26:00.834 --> 26:03.542
That's enough
to get an elephant high.

26:03.626 --> 26:05.918
You know, sellin' those
is a felony.

26:07.334 --> 26:09.459
No shit.

26:09.542 --> 26:11.334
( door slams )

26:11.417 --> 26:12.959
( buzzer )

26:26.125 --> 26:30.167
Man: Mr. Strasmore.
I hear you have some...

26:30.250 --> 26:31.834
pill problems.

26:33.668 --> 26:36.584
- Lawyer.
- That won't be necessary,
Spencer.

26:36.668 --> 26:38.959
You don't mind
if I call you Spencer,
do you?

26:39.042 --> 26:40.042
Who are you?

26:40.125 --> 26:42.376
My name is
Jimmy Dale Pritchard,

26:42.459 --> 26:45.000
but my friends call me J.D.

26:45.084 --> 26:46.793
I got a script
for those pills, J.D.

26:46.876 --> 26:49.000
Oh, I don't care
about those pills.

26:49.084 --> 26:51.918
That was just my way
of gettin' the boys to be
able to bring you in

26:52.000 --> 26:54.209
so that we could
have a little chat.

26:54.292 --> 26:56.584
( laughs ) I know
it was a bit dramatic.

26:56.668 --> 27:00.501
But we wanted to make sure
that we had your...

27:00.584 --> 27:02.417
undivided attention.

27:02.501 --> 27:04.501
Who's "we"?

27:04.584 --> 27:06.834
Is this your first time
in Columbus?

27:06.918 --> 27:08.834
You know, this is
a beautiful city,

27:08.918 --> 27:10.668
and a great place
to go to school.

27:10.751 --> 27:13.084
You know, I met my wife
on campus?

27:13.167 --> 27:16.084
Thirty-five years ago.
And we still goin' strong.

27:16.167 --> 27:17.918
( chuckles ) Hey, now,

27:18.000 --> 27:20.959
you may find this
hard to believe, but...

27:21.042 --> 27:23.000
I used to play
a little bit myself.

27:23.084 --> 27:25.292
Yeah. I mean,
second string, of course.

27:25.376 --> 27:27.918
But, man,
did I have the spirit!

27:29.209 --> 27:33.959
You know the guy Todd
that you spoke to today?

27:34.042 --> 27:38.209
- He was my freshman roommate.
- Ah. So you're a booster.

27:39.918 --> 27:41.042
I hate that word.

27:42.209 --> 27:45.876
I prefer...
"enthusiastic supporter."

27:47.709 --> 27:50.668
You see, I do all of this
just for the pride of it.

27:50.751 --> 27:53.292
Now, for someone like yourself,
that might be challenging.

27:53.376 --> 27:57.834
But... for some of us,
well, that's enough.

27:57.918 --> 28:00.125
( smacks wall ) Let me
tell you something, J.D.

28:00.209 --> 28:02.834
I was only trying
to help my girlfriend's son
make some life decisions.

28:02.918 --> 28:05.209
Maybe that's hard
for you to believe,
but it's the truth.

28:05.292 --> 28:07.793
Let me tell you something else.
If I happen to piss on
your Rose Parade,

28:07.876 --> 28:09.626
then you better open up
a goddamn umbrella,

28:09.709 --> 28:11.417
because you sauntering
in here, and this,

28:11.501 --> 28:13.167
and all this bullshit,
doesn't scare me one bit.

28:13.250 --> 28:16.918
That's good.
It doesn't scare you.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.334
Well, I got some friends
over at the NCAA

28:20.417 --> 28:23.793
that will have a field day
with puttin' the fear of God
in your heart.

28:23.876 --> 28:25.584
Oh, is that right?

28:25.668 --> 28:28.084
So you gonna go
Old Testament on me, J.D.?

28:29.793 --> 28:33.292
The kid stays a Buckeye...

28:34.918 --> 28:37.459
everything
goes back to normal,

28:37.542 --> 28:41.125
and life is good for everyone.

28:41.209 --> 28:44.417
And if not,
we're comin' for you

28:44.501 --> 28:48.042
and everything you got
your dirty little hands in.

28:48.125 --> 28:51.584
And believe me...
we know things.

28:53.084 --> 28:55.125
That's right. Look away.

28:56.668 --> 28:58.459
Guard: Open four.

29:09.751 --> 29:10.876
J.D.:
Spencer.

29:10.959 --> 29:12.292

29:12.376 --> 29:13.542
