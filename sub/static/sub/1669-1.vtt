Is this
the past or the present
you're talking about?

00:53.453 --> 00:57.321
And this is real?
This is a story,
or this is real?

00:58.358 --> 01:00.019
Working on your man,
Walter Weed.

01:00.126 --> 01:03.493
Yeah, interesting
career. Forty years,
same division, same desk.

01:07.967 --> 01:10.231
Is this that in-transmission
that's been tracking?

01:10.336 --> 01:13.396
Yep. There's
an awful lot of crypto
in the carrier wave,

01:13.506 --> 01:16.532
and they're using
some kind of
spread spectrum.

01:17.944 --> 01:20.071
Is that accurate?
The name?

01:21.047 --> 01:22.674
Walter Weed. Yes.

01:24.117 --> 01:26.415
My wife, Elizabeth,
daughter, Mary.

01:26.519 --> 01:29.750
Why is the bureau putting
a close protection team
on Weed?

01:29.856 --> 01:31.187
The question's
why would they need to?

01:31.291 --> 01:33.259
Retiring, wheelchair-bound,
mid-level information analyst.

01:33.359 --> 01:34.656
There's really
nothing to tell.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.695
How many enemies
can this guy have?

01:40.867 --> 01:44.200
Tell me about April 19th.
April 19th, 3:00 a.m.,
to be precise.

01:46.639 --> 01:48.800
Am I in some
sort of trouble?

01:49.642 --> 01:52.543
No, Walter,
you're in very
specific trouble.

01:52.645 --> 01:54.875
Bureau intel has
decoded credible data

01:55.615 --> 01:58.709
that a multimillion-dollar
contract has been put
into play

01:58.818 --> 02:00.809
by parties
as yet unknown.

02:01.354 --> 02:04.619
Unconfirmed information
is that this is
an open contract,

02:04.724 --> 02:07.022
and that multiple assets
may be involved.

02:07.127 --> 02:10.687
Confirmed information
from our good friends
at ViCAP

02:10.797 --> 02:13.789
had the termination date
April 19th, 3:00 a.m.

02:14.701 --> 02:16.032
Tomorrow?

02:16.769 --> 02:17.997
Tomorrow.

02:21.307 --> 02:23.605
And you said,
"Termination date"?

02:23.943 --> 02:25.570
Your termination.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.776
You're the target.

02:32.886 --> 02:35.377
Tomorrow's the day
you're supposed
to die, Walter.

02:38.158 --> 02:41.150
This is some kind of
a gag, isn't it?

02:41.261 --> 02:43.252
Abrams is behind this,
isn't he? Right.

02:43.363 --> 02:44.352
For my retirement party?

02:44.464 --> 02:46.864
This is
an assassination market.

02:46.966 --> 02:50.925
Normally this level of asset
engagement is associated
with heads of state.

02:51.037 --> 02:53.505
Mubarak was
a market target
four years back.

02:53.606 --> 02:55.665
Hamid Karzai
more recently.

02:56.876 --> 03:01.040
You're talking about people
of great importance and power.

03:02.315 --> 03:06.411
What do I have
in common with them?
Why would I be a target?

03:07.387 --> 03:09.878
That's what we want
to know, Walter.

03:12.792 --> 03:14.487
So tell me a story.

03:47.594 --> 03:49.687
You asked to
see me, Father?

03:53.299 --> 03:55.995
I thought we should
pray together, girl.

03:56.469 --> 03:59.961
Pray together
and ask the Lord to
forgive you your sins.

04:01.808 --> 04:04.208
You do want God's love,
don't you?

04:07.247 --> 04:09.010
Of course, Father.

04:09.115 --> 04:10.980
Well, then you know
what you must do.

04:52.058 --> 04:53.548
Please, Father,

04:56.095 --> 04:57.562
kiss me first?

05:29.295 --> 05:33.322
I was sent by the parents
of the children you took
liberties with.

05:35.768 --> 05:40.034
As penance for your sins,
they've asked for nothing
less than your life.

06:00.593 --> 06:04.085
Sometimes, true forgiveness
has to be forced upon us.

06:17.844 --> 06:20.005
An unknown individual
has put a bounty on your head

06:20.113 --> 06:22.377
that'll draw every animal
who can point a gun,

06:22.482 --> 06:23.847
wield a knife,
or crush a skull.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.679
Sublime, as always.

06:29.455 --> 06:33.255
This individual,
the un-sub contracting
this hit,

06:33.793 --> 06:37.320
is likely a major player in
international assassinations.

06:37.463 --> 06:41.092
It's not likely that we'll
know the size and scale of
the threat against you,

06:41.200 --> 06:43.691
but we should be
ready for anything.

06:45.772 --> 06:48.969
I've been employed
and entrusted with
a responsibility.

06:49.075 --> 06:53.478
What would happen to the
world if we all abandoned
our responsibilities, Marty?

06:53.579 --> 06:55.171
Look, we could...

06:57.049 --> 06:59.017
Chaos. That's what
would happen.

06:59.118 --> 07:02.087
Yeah. I understand
that, all right?
Believe me, I do.

07:02.188 --> 07:04.656
But everything
has a price, right?
And I can pay.

07:05.792 --> 07:08.625
I'm talking $2,000,000.
Please.

07:09.862 --> 07:11.329
Okay, okay,
fuck that, fuck that.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.899
Look, l...
I could get you more.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.864
A lot more.
My brother,
Morris Mecklen,

07:16.969 --> 07:20.166
he's got this client,
Buddy Israel, he's got
shitloads of cash.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.764
Two days and you'll have
the money. Just two days!

07:22.875 --> 07:23.864
Please!

07:23.976 --> 07:25.341
We don't have
two days, Marty.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.037
We only have now.

07:29.315 --> 07:32.716
The Mayans and
the ancient Egyptians
practiced brain surgery.

07:33.152 --> 07:34.847
What the fuck?
But it was
Dr. Walter Freeman

07:34.954 --> 07:36.478
who perfected it.

07:36.589 --> 07:38.386
Depending on
the position... Don't do this.

07:38.491 --> 07:42.291
...and the depth
of the ice pick,
one can neutralize pain,

07:43.162 --> 07:45.995
the language center,
or short-term memory.

07:48.067 --> 07:52.299
My eyes!
I can't see! Jesus.
God. What the fuck?

07:52.405 --> 07:53.895
Different parts
of the brain,

07:54.006 --> 07:55.132
Wait, wait. different results.

07:55.241 --> 07:57.903
$3,000,000. I can
get you $3,000,000.

07:58.010 --> 08:00.877
The cerebellum
controls speech, Marty,

08:00.980 --> 08:03.107
not your hearing,
so listen very carefully.

08:03.216 --> 08:04.205
Don't do this.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.649
The people
who have employed me
have already paid me,

08:06.752 --> 08:08.720
and once
I've been paid,

08:08.855 --> 08:10.379
I see the Job through.
No!

08:10.490 --> 08:13.288
No! You don't
have to do this!
Otherwise, chaos.

08:13.926 --> 08:16.019
This is like an
open casting for killers.

08:16.128 --> 08:18.961
Every sociopath in
the known world looking
to pick up a paycheck

08:19.065 --> 08:21.056
is gonna be coming
out of the woodwork.

08:31.944 --> 08:32.967
McTeague.

08:33.078 --> 08:34.636
I have a job for you.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.313
Are you free?

08:36.414 --> 08:37.712
Free, no.
Available, yes.

08:39.986 --> 08:42.750
Our intel is still
in the assessment phase.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.824
What we're finding
is that these assets

08:44.924 --> 08:48.985
show no allegiance to any
individual government
or political ideals.

08:49.095 --> 08:50.153
They're just
cold-blooded killers.

08:50.597 --> 08:52.121
Yeah! Yeah!
Fucker! Look at me.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.792
Where's my fucking shipment?
Where is it?

08:56.302 --> 08:58.998
Where's my
fucking shipment?

08:59.539 --> 09:03.373
They're on the base.
They're on the base.
All right?

09:03.743 --> 09:06.906
All right?
They're watching me.
They were watching so...

09:08.314 --> 09:10.111
You're gonna fuck me?

09:10.216 --> 09:12.241
Oh, I am fucking you.

09:12.352 --> 09:17.585
I want my
motherfucking weapons!

09:17.824 --> 09:20.315
You motherfucking filthy...

09:30.437 --> 09:31.426
They're in the depot.

09:31.538 --> 09:34.029
Excellent work, sailor.
Dismissed.

09:34.941 --> 09:37.205
The variety of
monsters tracking you
that are already

09:37.310 --> 09:38.937
more than likely
on their way here

09:39.045 --> 09:41.673
is like the
World Series of assassins.

09:44.250 --> 09:49.552
Gonna make this Joke about
you shooting your load
and then me shooting you,

09:52.659 --> 09:54.490
but it wasn't as good
as "dismissed."

09:59.432 --> 10:03.027
How was the old swabbie?
Ring your bell, did he?

10:05.605 --> 10:09.837
Fucker said they's holding
our stash in an armory
Just inside the depot.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.741
You know, I heard that
most Navy recruits

10:12.846 --> 10:15.542
have had at least
one homosexual experience

10:15.648 --> 10:17.047
before they's
even midshipman,

10:17.150 --> 10:20.642
so, Sis, I was wondering,
I mean, was his deck gun
firing?

10:20.753 --> 10:23.221
Or maybe he was banging you
while he was thinking
about Popeye's forearms.

10:24.941 --> 10:26.465
Lester, why don't
you just admit

10:26.575 --> 10:30.136
that you want this
sweet little package
all to yourself, huh?

10:30.245 --> 10:32.179
I admit I wouldn't
mind a little...

10:32.281 --> 10:33.942
Come on. Come on, now.
Don't you fucking touch me,

10:34.049 --> 10:36.449
you fucking prick.
Get your fucking dirty
paws off me, fucker.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.816
Don't you know,
boy, the danger of
blood relations?

10:38.921 --> 10:41.446
That's what
double-fucked
the Confederacy.

10:41.557 --> 10:43.286
That's how we lost
the Civil War.

10:43.392 --> 10:45.223
You think you want
a whole slew of kids
running around

10:45.327 --> 10:50.026
whose eyeballs are touching
because you can't keep
your hands off your sister?

10:50.165 --> 10:51.223
Bunny Rabbit.

10:52.835 --> 10:55.303
Time to get serious.
We gonna acquire us
some fire.

11:02.578 --> 11:03.806
God damn!

11:13.956 --> 11:16.857
That's a mini!
Four thousand rounds
a minute.

11:17.359 --> 11:19.759
Let's go, Sling Blade,
shake a leg!

11:23.298 --> 11:25.425
Well, if it ain't
the great benefactor.

11:26.602 --> 11:29.867
God damn it, Lester!
Suppressive fire!

11:31.340 --> 11:33.171
Always busy, sugar.

11:33.275 --> 11:36.176
We like to keep it oiled
so we's always ready
to roll hard.

11:36.278 --> 11:38.337
What you got
for us, honey?

11:40.983 --> 11:42.007
Why?

11:45.587 --> 11:49.353
There's a theory that this
has to do with some code
that you cracked,

11:49.458 --> 11:53.053
some piece of cryptology
that is meaningless
with you alive

11:53.162 --> 11:55.460
but invaluable
with you dead.

11:55.564 --> 11:57.828
I am only
medium-security clearance.

11:58.767 --> 12:01.327
Any top secrets
that are disseminated

12:01.670 --> 12:04.833
are deemed declassified
long before they ever
cross my desk.

12:04.940 --> 12:07.704
Walter, we can
head-scratch the semantics
of this all day,

12:07.810 --> 12:09.744
but the clock
is ticking.

12:26.094 --> 12:29.393
Oh, God, my face.
What's wrong with my face?

12:31.099 --> 12:35.058
What did you do to my face?
No! No, please!

12:45.581 --> 12:46.878
That's it?

12:53.555 --> 12:56.115
I thought you were
gonna cut my face.

12:56.592 --> 12:58.253
You're not gonna
cut my face, are you?

12:58.360 --> 13:00.521
No. The face is sacred.

13:01.430 --> 13:03.022
But the throat...

13:03.866 --> 13:06.300
Most of these
operators we know
by deed only,

13:06.401 --> 13:09.734
but they will be cold-blooded,
ruthless professionals.

13:15.010 --> 13:15.310
The bureau has mobilized
my team with the express
purpose

13:15.310 --> 13:17.835
The bureau has mobilized
my team with the express
purpose

13:17.946 --> 13:22.042
of protecting and thereby
extending your life,
and that's a good thing.

13:23.552 --> 13:26.544
I trust these people
with my life,

13:26.655 --> 13:28.782
and we're asking you
to trust us with yours.

13:29.358 --> 13:31.292
Agent Dumare,
counter-protocol.

13:31.393 --> 13:33.987
Agents Abrego and Nicholas,
transport and monitoring.

13:34.096 --> 13:35.222
Sir.

13:35.330 --> 13:37.594
Agent Redstone's gonna
be on close protection
detail with our SAC.

13:37.699 --> 13:38.757
Hey.

13:41.303 --> 13:43.828
You'll be moved to
an undisclosed location

13:43.939 --> 13:46.339
until the deadline
and the bounty expire.

13:49.978 --> 13:50.967
What is the price?

13:51.079 --> 13:54.139
$3,000,000.
That is mmm-mmm good.

13:54.516 --> 13:55.505
For $3,000,000...

13:55.617 --> 13:56.777
I'd kill my own mother.

13:56.885 --> 13:59.376
Actually, I did,
for a lot less than that.

14:00.923 --> 14:03.050
God, I... $3,000,000?

14:03.158 --> 14:05.888
I can't imagine
what I would've done in
my life to warrant such...

14:05.994 --> 14:08.485
Walter. They're
never gonna collect.

14:09.564 --> 14:13.261
You just give us the word
and we'll go all the way
to the wall for you.

14:27.616 --> 14:28.981
The exact time
of kill is...

14:29.084 --> 14:31.143
Is a non-negotiable point.

14:31.486 --> 14:33.113
April 19th, 3:00 a.m.

14:33.622 --> 14:37.490
Any deviation from
this timeline nullifies
any form of payment.

14:46.001 --> 14:48.663
You just have
that money waiting
on the 20th, sugar,

14:48.770 --> 14:51.637
and I will have
something sweet
waiting for you.

14:55.210 --> 14:59.044
All right, Agent Baker.
My life is in your hands.

15:10.258 --> 15:11.987
Keeping
our subject alive

15:12.094 --> 15:14.892
depends in no small part
on the secrecy of this op.

15:16.198 --> 15:19.429
We are ghosts, gentlemen.
We do not exist.

15:19.534 --> 15:21.229
We're completely off
the clock on this one.

15:21.336 --> 15:24.271
We're all being
paid cash, tax-free,

15:24.373 --> 15:26.898
in an effort to leave
absolutely no footprint.

15:28.043 --> 15:31.706
You all know Agent Dumare.
He'll be in charge
of overwatch.

15:32.514 --> 15:37.508
Agents Williamson, Osterberg,
will be in charge of sniper
and recon at location.

15:38.153 --> 15:40.121
Culham will be
down on the street.

15:40.222 --> 15:43.783
Jules and her team will be
our sole point of contact
within the bureau.

15:43.892 --> 15:45.723
We're overlord 24/7.

15:45.827 --> 15:48.955
We'll have real-time
sat images, local news
and law enforcement feeds.

15:49.064 --> 15:50.497
Anything happens
in or around you,

15:50.599 --> 15:52.590
you'll know
about it immediately.

15:52.701 --> 15:54.168
All this trouble for me.

15:54.269 --> 15:55.293
Why this guy?

15:55.404 --> 15:59.500
I suppose I should be
flattered, somebody
wanting me dead so badly.

15:59.941 --> 16:02.239
Great men
attract great enemies.

16:03.211 --> 16:05.076
Well, I hardly qualify.

16:06.281 --> 16:11.116
I shot a gun once on
a range in Quantico,
at a paper target.

16:13.155 --> 16:16.318
Well, I've fired hundreds
of them hundreds of times.

16:16.425 --> 16:18.154
Don't worry, Walter.

16:18.360 --> 16:21.329
We promise
not to let things
get too exciting.

16:21.930 --> 16:25.058
Our location will be unknown
until we touch down.

16:25.300 --> 16:27.996
That means we'll be
traveling signal-free.

16:28.103 --> 16:32.039
That's no cell phones,
PDAs, nothing that
receives or transmits.

16:32.474 --> 16:34.032
You got them,
give them up.

16:34.142 --> 16:35.632
And all forms
of ID, as well.

16:35.744 --> 16:38.645
Remember,
none of us exists
as of this moment.

16:38.747 --> 16:40.772
So, what, things go
sideways, no pension?

16:40.882 --> 16:42.713
The way you fucking eat,
you won't make it
to pension anyway.

17:00.702 --> 17:04.229
We're T minus 30.
I'll see you in transpo.

17:04.339 --> 17:05.931
All right,
immediate mount
and mobilize.

17:06.040 --> 17:08.566
Don't let the door hit
your ass on the way out.

17:08.676 --> 17:11.907
Dom, I'm serious
about that pension, man.
I got a kid. You know that.

17:12.012 --> 17:14.777
You fucking stunad,
they can't take
your pension away.

17:14.883 --> 17:17.078
Not unless
you do something
completely horrible.

17:17.185 --> 17:19.210
Don't you remember Cabo,
with the soap?

17:20.922 --> 17:23.982
How old are you?
Thirty-two? In charge
of this unit?

17:24.092 --> 17:26.526
Somebody up there
likes you.

17:26.627 --> 17:29.153
You're soaring up,
and I'm headed down.

17:32.100 --> 17:35.467
You must have some pretty
amazing memories, though.

17:36.371 --> 17:38.601
Any one in particular
stick out?

17:38.707 --> 17:40.572
Meeting Ronald Reagan.

17:44.846 --> 17:48.509
I can only imagine,
it must've been like
Moses going up the mount

17:48.617 --> 17:50.983
and God coming forth.

17:53.622 --> 17:55.089
He was
a colossal figure.

17:55.190 --> 17:56.248
God?

17:58.960 --> 18:00.154
Reagan.

18:01.563 --> 18:02.723
Sorry.

18:03.732 --> 18:04.790
Okay.

18:06.101 --> 18:07.932
God was colossal, too.

18:40.936 --> 18:44.565
Okay, gentlemen,
recon takes up station
and plots position.

18:44.673 --> 18:46.038
We don't breathe
until they say it's good.

19:08.930 --> 19:11.398
Good to go.
Clear to offload. Over.

19:17.772 --> 19:18.830
What do you
got for me?

19:18.940 --> 19:20.339
Rocket fuel.

19:37.792 --> 19:39.089
Thank you.

19:39.728 --> 19:42.629
Want you to meet
Special Agent Malcolm Little.

19:42.731 --> 19:43.823
Welcome to Little Jazz.

19:43.932 --> 19:46.230
These are my agents
you guys are gonna be
working with.

19:48.837 --> 19:51.670
This door is your
first line of defense

19:51.773 --> 19:55.800
out of what essentially
is a bunker.

20:03.852 --> 20:07.288
Gentlemen, you're looking
at a little piece of history.

20:10.558 --> 20:15.291
Turn of the last century,
they built freight tunnels
throughout all of Chicago.

20:15.597 --> 20:17.588
Transport
butchered steer.

20:18.233 --> 20:21.760
Back in those days,
these tunnels were
swimming in blood.

20:23.738 --> 20:26.798
And if it wasn't
the slaughterhouses
using them,

20:27.375 --> 20:30.401
it was the bootleggers
running guns and liquor.

20:41.456 --> 20:43.151
These tunnels
used to connect
the sewer system.

20:43.258 --> 20:45.123
They sealed them shut
in the early '50s.

20:45.226 --> 20:49.162
In 1955, Ike's administration
came through and built
the bunker.

20:49.297 --> 20:51.060
Sorry. Ike?

20:52.334 --> 20:55.394
Eisenhower, rookie.
Jesus, who hired this punk?

20:56.338 --> 20:58.829
If it's not on an iPod,
these kids haven't
heard of it.

20:58.940 --> 21:00.271
Don't let them
ride you, Nick-Nick.

21:00.375 --> 21:03.173
You don't give it
back tenfold,
they'll eat you alive.

21:03.278 --> 21:06.270
Next time Red
messes with you,
ask him about Gearbox.

21:06.381 --> 21:07.541
Yeah. Gearbox?

21:14.689 --> 21:17.123
Gentlemen,
the main bunker.

21:18.293 --> 21:20.022
You know, truth be told,
it used to be a private
speakeasy

21:20.128 --> 21:22.824
for Sammy "The Ant" Battaglia
during Prohibition.

21:22.931 --> 21:26.230
Later on,
one of our most wanted,
Primo Sparazza,

21:26.501 --> 21:27.934
used to take
his girls in here,

21:28.036 --> 21:30.300
get his little geriatric
shimmy-shake on.

21:30.405 --> 21:32.168
What evac points
are available to us?

21:32.273 --> 21:34.468
Well, that's
the good and the bad.

21:34.576 --> 21:38.910
It would take more munitions
to bring down my doors
than level all Chicago,

21:39.013 --> 21:42.847
but it's a warren.
There's only one way
in and one way out.

21:43.618 --> 21:45.586
Not too crazy
about that.

21:46.688 --> 21:49.657
You guys got
enough food and booze to
last you about six months.

21:49.758 --> 21:51.726
Plus you have
complete surveillance

21:51.826 --> 21:54.818
of upstairs, corridors,
and outside the club.

21:55.330 --> 21:59.130
Seriously,
you'd have to be suicidal
to take a run at my spot.

22:01.369 --> 22:03.462
Walter, what do you think?

22:04.839 --> 22:08.206
I think I'm about as safe
as it's possible to make me.

22:08.309 --> 22:09.333
What do you got here?

22:09.444 --> 22:10.468
That would be
a spider hole.

22:10.578 --> 22:12.478
Jesus, Saddam renting
this place from you?

22:12.580 --> 22:13.547
Wow.

22:13.648 --> 22:15.775
If you're that impressed,
rookie, why don't you
Jump down in there?

22:15.884 --> 22:17.112
Sorry?
No, don't be sorry.

22:17.218 --> 22:19.118
Just get down in there.
Give us a demonstration.

22:19.220 --> 22:22.121
Come on, rookie,
in the hole.
Go on, get in there.

22:23.224 --> 22:24.486
Go on.
Oh. Okay.

22:24.592 --> 22:26.617
Yeah. Right after
you explain Gearbox.

22:28.062 --> 22:29.495
Rookie fights back.
I like that.

22:29.631 --> 22:30.825
Okay, who the fuck
told him that?

22:32.133 --> 22:33.532
That would be me.
You know,

22:33.635 --> 22:35.569
I figured he ought to
know the kind of man
he's working with.

22:35.670 --> 22:36.967
You fucking...
No, hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

22:37.071 --> 22:38.971
You didn't follow through.
It's the follow-through
that matters.

22:39.073 --> 22:40.563
Still, he nearly
fucked a tranny.

22:40.675 --> 22:42.905
A she-he, bro.
That's gotta fucking
leave a mark.

22:43.011 --> 22:44.342
Hey! Easy.

22:46.147 --> 22:49.844
You girls want to play
grab-ass, you do it on
your own time, not mine.

22:51.319 --> 22:52.843
I need you
right and tight.
Yes, sir.

22:52.954 --> 22:54.683
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

22:56.224 --> 22:57.987
Let's load in
and station up.

22:59.761 --> 23:00.989
Yes, sir.

23:03.498 --> 23:07.195
Fucking guineas.
You get them to Chicago,
they get brave.

23:08.670 --> 23:11.138
If I'm not mistaken,
he sounded a little racist.

23:11.239 --> 23:12.763
Easy, the guy's
a fucking hard-on.

23:12.874 --> 23:15.604
You fuck with the bull,
you get the horns, right?

23:30.425 --> 23:31.722
Minotaurs.

23:32.627 --> 23:35.562
Minotaurs are
cloven-hoofed creatures
of mythological origin.

23:35.663 --> 23:37.255
You mean miniatures.

23:37.365 --> 23:38.389
Yeah.

23:39.601 --> 23:41.034
You know what he meant.

23:41.135 --> 23:42.159
Yeah.

23:42.270 --> 23:45.762
You all be careful.
Them clown fuckers
can be dangerous,

23:46.574 --> 23:48.474
and the little ones
can be lethal.

23:48.576 --> 23:52.672
I always make it a point
not to cross swords with
carnies and harlots,

23:53.381 --> 23:58.284
but we can use them
little boys as a facade,
so there we are.

23:59.020 --> 23:59.987
Yeah.

24:00.088 --> 24:04.491
They're
Satan's little secret agents,
collecting souls on the side.

24:05.827 --> 24:07.761
I saw one of them
little bastards
levitate one time,

24:07.862 --> 24:11.059
took the heart
right out of a Great Dane,
eat it whole, just like that.

24:11.165 --> 24:12.427
Yep. You seen what?

24:12.534 --> 24:16.095
Where'd you see that?
Now that must've been
a sight to behold.

24:16.204 --> 24:18.672
Yeah. Sent me
running for my Bible.

24:18.873 --> 24:21.774
You still take comfort
in them fables, Daddy?

24:23.111 --> 24:25.079
Don't you blaspheme, boy.

24:25.246 --> 24:29.376
Never too old to put you
over my knee and beat
a reckoning into you.

24:29.784 --> 24:31.945
You're still scared
of clowns, Lester.

24:33.321 --> 24:35.812
I ain't scared
of them, per se,

24:35.924 --> 24:38.859
Just very mindful
of their movements,
that's all.

25:08.623 --> 25:10.318
Card tricks?

25:11.025 --> 25:12.424
Oh, a little.

25:14.295 --> 25:17.628
It's playing cards
themselves that I'm
interested in.

25:18.633 --> 25:21.124
They're based on
the old tarot deck,

25:22.270 --> 25:25.330
cards that were used
for foretelling
the future.

25:26.507 --> 25:29.999
Can't tell you
how handy that's gonna
come in down here.

25:30.979 --> 25:35.712
You don't really buy
into that old-world gypsy
bullshit, do you, Walter?

25:37.151 --> 25:40.587
The psychologist Carl Jung
had a different term for it.

25:42.090 --> 25:43.557
Synchronicity.

25:44.025 --> 25:47.893
The idea being that all of
nature's interconnected
in such a way

25:47.996 --> 25:50.658
that the past,
the present,
and the human mind,

25:50.765 --> 25:53.791
through an act of
random sampling,
if you will,

25:54.202 --> 25:56.796
can predict the course
of future actions.

25:56.904 --> 25:59.998
What's that thing I heard?
It's like the deck itself was
like the days of the week?

26:00.108 --> 26:01.837
Something like that?

26:03.144 --> 26:04.236
Mmm.

26:05.013 --> 26:10.383
Well, there's four suits
for the four seasons,

26:10.585 --> 26:13.053
52 cards for the
weeks in the year,

26:13.521 --> 26:19.084
and if you add up the pips
on every card in the deck,
it totals to 365,

26:19.193 --> 26:21.024
the number of days
in the year.

26:21.129 --> 26:23.154
All right.

26:23.264 --> 26:25.824
Where's my card,
ace of spades?
It's not in here.

26:27.001 --> 26:27.990
It's not there?

26:28.102 --> 26:29.569
No, it's not.

26:31.839 --> 26:34.672
Well, why don't you look
in Agent Baker's pocket?

26:48.289 --> 26:51.452
Not bad. That's good.
You see one of those.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.157
How the hell
did you do that?

26:54.262 --> 26:57.322
I can't tell you that.
It'll spoil it.

27:20.421 --> 27:23.948
What are these?
Are these government-issue
playing cards?

27:27.361 --> 27:28.350
No.

27:31.599 --> 27:35.968
I had them made.
You probably think
it's silly.

27:38.172 --> 27:40.663
Not at all.
You love your country.

27:40.775 --> 27:42.766
You've dedicated
your life to it.

27:48.049 --> 27:51.951
You want bald eagles
on your playing cards,
I think you've earned it.

28:43.437 --> 28:46.964
Gentlemen, should have
a real nice crowd
in here tonight.

28:47.475 --> 28:49.238
Cats playing? Tight.

28:50.511 --> 28:51.569
Yeah? Who's that?

28:51.679 --> 28:54.204
Well, the feature soloist
is this brother named Little.

28:54.315 --> 28:55.942
Got mad skills
on the horn.

28:56.050 --> 28:57.244
Uh-huh.

28:58.586 --> 29:02.078
So, how long you guys gonna
have it locked down in here?

29:03.324 --> 29:05.485
We'll hold out
till tomorrow.

29:06.394 --> 29:08.954
This thing's got
an expiration date
on it.

29:09.063 --> 29:12.499
After that, it won't be
worth anything to go
after him.

29:14.101 --> 29:15.625
They gotta
find us first.

29:15.736 --> 29:18.762
Even if they do,
they ain't getting
down there.

29:22.877 --> 29:24.868
You going back
to DC after this?

29:24.979 --> 29:26.139
No, man.

29:26.247 --> 29:30.547
Working on this alias
for this project I've
got in Vegas next year.

29:30.718 --> 29:32.709
Cat I like
to call Beanie.

29:33.187 --> 29:34.415
Ghetto retard,

29:34.522 --> 29:37.150
barely educated,
brought up in
a gang environment.

29:37.291 --> 29:39.088
Oh, that should be
a pretty easy transition
for you, then.

29:39.193 --> 29:41.320
What? I fucking
hate hip-hop.

29:41.429 --> 29:42.623
You hate hip-hop?
Come on.

29:42.730 --> 29:44.561
Oh, what? A black man
can't hate hip-hop?

29:44.665 --> 29:46.189
I bet you tell me
my favorite food's
watermelon.

29:46.300 --> 29:47.927
I just can't live
without chicken, huh?

29:48.035 --> 29:50.503
Just gonna snatch up my
brother badge if I ain't
bumping some hip-hop.

29:50.605 --> 29:52.266
You're putting
words in my mouth.
Hey, man, listen to me.

29:52.373 --> 29:54.773
Hip-hop is the
unwanted bastard son

29:54.876 --> 29:57.777
of superior musical forms
like jazz, blues.

29:58.079 --> 30:00.411
These kids don't know
anything about
Louis Armstrong,

30:00.514 --> 30:03.039
Miles Davis,
Dizzy Gillespie,

30:03.618 --> 30:08.783
but hey, when it's required
of me, I be pulling hos
out the club,

30:09.056 --> 30:14.392
flashing knots and
nines on these niggas.
You know how I do, pimp.

30:15.363 --> 30:18.855
Like I said,
should be a pretty
easy transition for you.

30:31.512 --> 30:32.911
Little too convincing,
Culham.

30:33.014 --> 30:34.276
Fuck you.

30:38.185 --> 30:39.482
Excuse me.

30:45.626 --> 30:48.094
Excuse me.
The keys to 409, please?

30:49.096 --> 30:50.393
Excuse me?

30:51.365 --> 30:55.927
Of course, sir.
Sorry, I'm still new.

31:10.985 --> 31:12.782
Culham, what do you got?

31:12.887 --> 31:13.945
All clear down here.

31:14.055 --> 31:18.151
Good, good.
Just stop short of blowing
strangers for bags of crack.

31:19.660 --> 31:21.628
Osterberg,
how's the view?

31:22.163 --> 31:23.653
Wide open
and whisper-quiet.

31:25.199 --> 31:27.190
All right,
keep it primed,
keep them peeled.

31:27.301 --> 31:28.325
All clear here, Baker.

31:28.436 --> 31:29.425
Copy that.

31:29.537 --> 31:31.596
Let's get all-around
sit-reps every 20.

31:31.706 --> 31:33.037
Copy that.

31:33.274 --> 31:34.434
Hey, how's my
paesan doing?

31:36.143 --> 31:38.077
-Fat and getting fatter.
-Fucking fatty.

31:38.179 --> 31:39.407
Hey! Hey!

31:40.448 --> 31:42.678
-Hey, watch it.
-Stakeouts equal
flab, Abrego.

31:42.783 --> 31:43.909
Sit-reps every 20.

32:00.334 --> 32:01.528
Yeah?

32:01.635 --> 32:04.001
Evening, neighbor.
I'm Troy from next door.

32:04.105 --> 32:06.938
I just want to make sure
that you got settled in
all right.

32:07.041 --> 32:08.770
I'm okay, thank you.

32:09.076 --> 32:12.341
A beautiful woman like you
in a town like Chicago...

32:12.446 --> 32:17.406
As your neighbor,
I just wanted to extend
every hospitality I can.

32:18.052 --> 32:19.246
Hmm.

32:19.587 --> 32:22.055
And what's that
hospitality consist of?

32:22.990 --> 32:24.321
What was it? Troy?

32:24.425 --> 32:26.188
Mmm-hmm.
So, so many things.

32:29.030 --> 32:30.224
You like to
get loco, huh?

32:30.331 --> 32:31.355
Yeah.

32:31.465 --> 32:33.194
Crazy.
Yeah, really crazy.

32:33.300 --> 32:35.268
What about experimenting?

32:35.369 --> 32:36.893
Baby, I'm at
your disposal.

32:38.305 --> 32:39.897
No. You will be.

32:41.809 --> 32:44.039
What do the
cards say, Walter?

32:44.145 --> 32:45.510
Wish I knew.

32:45.913 --> 32:48.074
I never could
get into cards.

32:48.883 --> 32:53.616
My grandfather, he would
sit at the kitchen table
and just wile away for hours.

32:54.588 --> 32:57.648
Always seemed a bit more
of a time-killer to me.

32:58.793 --> 33:02.388
Well, that's not surprising.
You're a man of action.

33:04.765 --> 33:06.699
Cards are more cerebral.

33:07.735 --> 33:09.202
Are they, now?

33:13.240 --> 33:15.435
So do you have
family, Walter?

33:22.683 --> 33:24.810
This is my wife, Elizabeth,
and my daughter, Mary.

33:24.919 --> 33:28.650
Wow, really...

33:30.991 --> 33:35.257
Wow, they're like
mirrors to one another.
Your wife is beautiful.

33:37.731 --> 33:41.633
There you go.
That's mine. Amelia.

33:45.106 --> 33:47.472
I never figured you
for a father.

33:48.209 --> 33:50.234
You almost seem shocked.

33:50.344 --> 33:51.743
Sorry. Pardon me.

33:52.346 --> 33:56.339
Well, that right there's
my pride and joy.

33:58.219 --> 33:59.550
So were mine.

34:05.025 --> 34:06.549
Tractor-trailer
on the beltway

34:08.661 --> 34:09.822
lost...

34:11.931 --> 34:12.899
Lost control.

34:25.779 --> 34:27.940
I lost all the
things I love,

34:30.417 --> 34:35.650
but through all the horrible,
horrible things we have to
go through,

34:39.426 --> 34:43.418
I still find that
one thing worth
living for.

34:46.500 --> 34:48.331
What's that one thing?

34:49.503 --> 34:50.527
Sir?

34:53.641 --> 34:55.268
I'm sorry, Walter.

35:13.961 --> 35:15.258
Who is it?

35:44.592 --> 35:46.116
Agent Dumare?

35:46.227 --> 35:47.216
Who's there?

36:10.751 --> 36:11.740
Miss me?

36:11.852 --> 36:13.786
A girl doesn't
want to seem too eager.

36:13.921 --> 36:15.752
Go secure for encrypt.

36:20.127 --> 36:21.492
Line secure.

36:23.197 --> 36:24.824
What's on the grid?

36:24.932 --> 36:26.866
Nothing. You're
completely spectral,

36:26.967 --> 36:30.368
and your location through
everything we've been
monitoring is spotless,

36:30.471 --> 36:32.905
but we did find something
on our mystery man.

36:33.007 --> 36:34.907
He's been on the radar
for about three years

36:35.009 --> 36:36.636
and he's been
a very busy boy.

36:36.744 --> 36:39.645
Brokered at least two dozen
high-profile contract kills.

36:39.747 --> 36:42.614
This guy has worked
schoolboy hard to
shield his ID,

36:42.716 --> 36:45.685
but I think we got a name.
I mean, most likely an alias.

36:45.786 --> 36:47.185
Hal Leuco.

36:47.855 --> 36:49.345
Hal Leuco?

36:49.456 --> 36:52.516
Okay, do me a favor. See if
you get any cross-corollary
hits with ViCAP.

36:52.626 --> 36:53.684
Check the
right-wing stuff.

36:53.794 --> 36:56.786
You know, those Limbaugh
assholes, just like the
boys you used to date.

36:57.564 --> 37:00.055
Never been that lucky.
What are you thinking?

37:00.167 --> 37:04.365
I don't know. Maybe nothing.
I just got a gut thing
on this one.

37:05.105 --> 37:06.231
You got it, honey.

37:06.540 --> 37:07.905
And your heart forever?

37:08.008 --> 37:10.306
You've always
had that. Bye.

37:15.916 --> 37:19.579
This town's got more tunnels
than Ho Chi Minh's whorehouse.

37:20.721 --> 37:24.122
The whole city's a warren
of the wicked and depraved.

37:24.358 --> 37:26.451
Speaking of depraved,
you lay a paw on me again,

37:26.560 --> 37:29.324
I'm gonna shove that RPG
where the sun refuses
to shine.

37:31.498 --> 37:34.729
Remember old Bobby Dubap,
y'all? Down out of Tulsa?

37:36.036 --> 37:38.766
That shitstain got
himself keistered
with an RPG.

37:38.872 --> 37:40.066
Did they fire it?

37:40.174 --> 37:41.232
Fire it?

37:42.676 --> 37:45.702
I'm telling you, boy.
I mean, if you took
the time now

37:45.813 --> 37:49.840
to bother to stuff
a collapsible
shoulder-launch RPG

37:49.950 --> 37:53.386
up somebody's bunghole,
don't you think
you'd fire it?

37:54.221 --> 37:57.190
Wouldn't you feel
Just a little let down
if you didn't?

37:57.291 --> 38:00.419
Why would
you put it up there
in the first place?

38:00.861 --> 38:03.193
I don't know.
You got your thumb
up there most of the time.

38:03.297 --> 38:04.559
Why don't you tell me?

38:04.665 --> 38:06.895
Y'all are real at
each other right now.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.025
Ah, don't pay him no mind.

38:09.336 --> 38:13.136
His brother Jeeves,
brother Darwin
up to stir, see?

38:14.308 --> 38:17.709
Now he thinks
he's fit, maybe,
to take over this clan.

38:18.212 --> 38:22.273
I'd rather be incarcerated
than have to sit here and
listen to your JibberJabber.

38:22.383 --> 38:26.342
Yeah, I can see that.
You'd last about one
minute up in the pen.

38:29.423 --> 38:32.483
Yeah, you'd really be
reckoning with your
feminine side.

38:34.077 --> 38:35.977
Yeah, well, there's
gonna be reckoning,
old boy, right quick.

38:36.079 --> 38:38.775
"There's gonna be
a reckoning, old boy."

38:41.618 --> 38:42.785
Good to see
you're prepared.
Staying focused.

38:42.785 --> 38:43.843
Good to see
you're prepared.
Staying focused.

38:43.953 --> 38:47.753
Oh, I am. I'm utterly
focused on that rack.

38:48.358 --> 38:50.826
Is that not
a majestic set of tits?

38:52.028 --> 38:53.723
What? Are you
being serious?

38:53.830 --> 38:54.922
What?

38:55.164 --> 38:56.961
You're joking, right?

38:57.367 --> 38:59.392
What? What the hell
you talking about?

39:00.270 --> 39:03.137
Vandeven is
a transvestite.

39:03.239 --> 39:04.263
What?

39:04.374 --> 39:06.399
Her vagina was
made with, like,
the scrotum sack.

39:06.509 --> 39:07.771
She's, like, 85% man.

39:07.877 --> 39:09.970
Come on. Come on, Red.
Oh, fuck.

39:10.079 --> 39:13.845
Are you serious?
I didn't know.
Seriously?

39:14.617 --> 39:17.085
No. Go relieve Abrego
and O'Keefe.

39:17.186 --> 39:21.282
Okay. Okay, Bake.
You guys, you got to knock
that Gearbox shit off.

39:21.391 --> 39:22.824
And if that kid
gives me lip about it,

39:22.926 --> 39:25.656
I am gonna permanently
alter his speech pattern,
I'm serious.

39:25.762 --> 39:28.754
All right,
take the kid with you.
Try not to kill him. Come on.

39:28.865 --> 39:31.857
Jesus, you guys.
Rookie, let's go.

39:46.950 --> 39:49.214
You're worried
about something.

39:50.954 --> 39:55.084
Lot of steel and concrete
between you and anyone
that wants to get to you.

39:57.093 --> 39:59.152
A name did
come up, though.

40:06.336 --> 40:09.737
Hal Leuco.
That ring any bells?

40:14.527 --> 40:15.516
No.

40:15.861 --> 40:18.796
Never heard of it?
Never came across
your desk?

40:23.236 --> 40:26.262
I haven't been involved
in that level of intel
in quite some time now,

40:26.372 --> 40:30.433
but if I was, I would've
cross-referenced it.

40:30.543 --> 40:32.738
A name as distinctive
as Al Leuco.

40:33.813 --> 40:35.110
Hal Leuco.

40:38.351 --> 40:41.582
Walter,
if you know anything...

40:43.956 --> 40:46.550
Sorry, I wish I
could be more helpful.

41:16.055 --> 41:17.215
Hey, neighbor. Hey!

41:17.323 --> 41:18.756
I knew you were
a working girl.

41:18.858 --> 41:21.850
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Slow down, slow down, stud.

41:21.961 --> 41:24.657
Hey. I just got paid, okay?
Make this shit happen.

41:24.764 --> 41:26.629
Wait. Troy.

41:27.400 --> 41:28.765
What? Troy.

41:31.103 --> 41:35.870
I like to be seduced, Troy.
I like to be kissed slowly.

41:36.676 --> 41:39.577
I didn't think
you whores went
for the mouth.

41:49.088 --> 41:52.956
Think of all the grateful
women who will be spared
your charms.

41:53.859 --> 41:54.917
Hmm?

41:58.597 --> 41:59.791
Asshole.

42:02.868 --> 42:06.133
Ae fond kiss,
and then we sever

42:06.772 --> 42:06.939
Look, maybe it's
not just about Weed.
Why the 19th of April?

42:06.939 --> 42:10.568
Look, maybe it's
not just about Weed.
Why the 19th of April?

42:10.676 --> 42:12.507
What's the significance
of that?

42:12.611 --> 42:15.978
Well, that's gonna take
some real time, sweetie,
a search that broad.

42:16.082 --> 42:17.481
I'm gonna get
the whole world back.

42:17.583 --> 42:19.551
Well, press it, okay?
Something feels off.

42:20.119 --> 42:22.110
I ran Hal Leuco by him
and he had no recollection.

42:22.221 --> 42:24.451
But I did get some
preliminary kickback

42:24.557 --> 42:26.752
on that name crosscheck
with potential link

42:26.859 --> 42:30.795
to what looks like some
kind of veil or shadow op
codenamed "True Patriot."

42:31.297 --> 42:34.095
True Patriot?
Now, where'd that
data come from?

42:34.200 --> 42:36.896
It's just a random hit
off this right-wing
militia blog,

42:37.002 --> 42:38.970
which went off
post-9/11.

42:39.071 --> 42:40.470
Okay, dig it out for me,
will you, babe?

42:40.573 --> 42:41.904
We always do.

42:47.079 --> 42:48.706
Baker for overwatch.
Dumare, you copy?

42:53.319 --> 42:55.378
Dom? Sit-rep.
Where you at?

43:00.259 --> 43:01.851
Dumare, you copy?

43:04.330 --> 43:05.354
Dom?

43:07.700 --> 43:09.565
All clear here.

43:09.668 --> 43:11.465
Good. Let's hope
it stays that way.

43:12.638 --> 43:15.471
All right, boys,
we're getting into
the witching hour.

43:16.242 --> 43:19.405
That's when the party
starts, or the people
go home and go to sleep.

43:19.512 --> 43:22.413
Let's hope for the best
and expect the worst.

43:22.515 --> 43:25.348
I want you to keep
your shifts rotating.

43:25.451 --> 43:27.715
The next three hours
are critical.

43:27.820 --> 43:31.085
Anything looks out of place,
I want you all over it.

43:31.524 --> 43:35.085
Keep your mind tight
and your step light.
Baker out.

44:07.393 --> 44:09.554
Hey, man.
Help a brother out.

45:21.767 --> 45:23.735
Baker, do you copy? Okay.

45:30.576 --> 45:33.044
Remember now, honey pie,
3:00 a.m. and $3,000,000.

45:33.145 --> 45:34.578
Put the fear
of God in them.

45:34.680 --> 45:35.942
You'll hear me
coming, Daddy.

45:36.048 --> 45:39.848
Lester, you just try
and keep your hands
off your pecker, now.

45:40.719 --> 45:42.277
What can I get for you?

45:42.388 --> 45:43.855
What are you offering?

45:44.356 --> 45:46.517
That depends what
you have a taste for.

45:46.625 --> 45:49.560
And if my taste
runs toward musicians

45:49.662 --> 45:51.323
who happen to have
their own club?

45:51.430 --> 45:53.660
Hey, that makes you
an epicurean, baby.

45:53.766 --> 45:55.097
Excuse me.

45:56.068 --> 45:57.763
Mike Gooding,
CYA Records.

45:57.870 --> 45:59.132
I just listened
Nice. to that set, man.

45:59.238 --> 46:00.603
Very impressed,
very impressed.

46:00.706 --> 46:02.003
My man.
Welcome to Little Jazz.

46:02.107 --> 46:03.870
Hey, you want to thank you.
meet the band?

46:03.976 --> 46:04.965
Sure.

46:05.077 --> 46:06.476
All right.
Enjoy the show.

47:09.408 --> 47:10.841
Too much oil.

47:14.246 --> 47:15.543
Excuse me?

47:17.750 --> 47:19.513
You use too much oil.

47:20.419 --> 47:24.253
You're wearing Caron Poivre,
which is a good fragrance
for you,

47:24.356 --> 47:26.620
but it's being
ruined by the oil.

47:26.725 --> 47:29.888
Bravo. You're very good
about the perfume,

47:29.995 --> 47:33.123
but I don't use
oil on my skin.

47:37.169 --> 47:40.434
I didn't mention anything
about your skin.

47:40.539 --> 47:43.064
Think it's on the gun
you're wearing.

47:49.381 --> 47:52.544
I think tonight's
gonna end very badly
between us.

48:04.763 --> 48:07.425
Overwatch, we got
a vehicle pulling up.

48:08.200 --> 48:11.363
Like a low-rent
Cirque du Soleil-type thing.

48:11.470 --> 48:13.301
It's being towed
by a garbage truck.

48:14.206 --> 48:17.801
That pretend
street urchin smells
like John Law from here.

48:19.511 --> 48:22.878
Probably a couple
hawks on the roof.

48:22.981 --> 48:25.472
It's time to set
your brother loose.

48:36.495 --> 48:38.087
Dom, do you copy?

48:41.133 --> 48:42.122
Overwatch.

48:42.401 --> 48:45.131
What's wrong with this thing?
I'm not getting anything.

48:46.238 --> 48:47.830
Overwatch, do you copy?

48:48.841 --> 48:50.172
Copy that.

48:50.576 --> 48:52.168
Check it out.
Copy that.

49:05.324 --> 49:06.291
Osterberg!

49:07.493 --> 49:11.190
Dumare, I got an agent down,
I got an agent down.
Dom. Dom.

49:17.035 --> 49:20.004
Injuns two,
cowboys zero.

49:20.572 --> 49:22.563
Okay, so we got
some things on the date.

49:22.674 --> 49:26.542
April 19th. On current
or planned events we drew
nothing, but historically,

49:26.645 --> 49:28.169
Baker, some stuff came up.

49:28.280 --> 49:30.510
Oklahoma City bombing
took place on April 19th.

49:30.616 --> 49:34.245
Both the Bay of Pigs
and the siege at Waco
ended April 19th,

49:34.353 --> 49:35.980
and what a lot of Americans
don't realize

49:36.088 --> 49:38.613
is that April 19th was
originally Patriot's Day.

49:39.191 --> 49:43.685
But, Baker, April 19th
was the day that Weed
lost his family.

49:53.272 --> 49:54.705
Jesus Christ.

49:56.475 --> 49:57.737
What the hell
is True Patriot?

49:57.843 --> 50:00.471
From what I can glean,
some kind of reverse
PR campaign

50:00.579 --> 50:02.877
against the United States
on or around the time

50:02.981 --> 50:06.610
of widespread
international criticism
of the US government.

50:06.718 --> 50:08.982
So we already look bad,
and this is supposed
to make us look worse.

50:09.087 --> 50:11.021
Okay, what kind of ops
are we talking about?

50:11.123 --> 50:13.819
Torture of prisoners
in US custody,
all photographed.

50:13.926 --> 50:17.157
Radiation poisoning
of a Russian official
by the CIA.

50:17.396 --> 50:20.559
Murder of an Iraqi family,
supposedly by a US soldier,

50:20.666 --> 50:22.725
and the bombing of a subway
in an allied country

50:22.835 --> 50:25.702
in order to sway support
against the Iraqi war.

50:25.804 --> 50:28.796
All carried out
under the banner
of True Patriot.

50:30.008 --> 50:32.499
Prisoner torture,
that's Abu Ghraib.

50:32.611 --> 50:34.238
Radiation poisoning,
Litvinenko.

50:34.847 --> 50:37.645
Iraqi family murders,
Mahmudiyah killings.

50:38.450 --> 50:41.317
Train station bombings,
Madrid subway attacks.

50:41.420 --> 50:42.887
Look, I want you
to dig deep on this.

50:42.988 --> 50:44.956
Okay? I want bank accounts,
I want anything and
everything...

50:45.057 --> 50:47.525
Already done. We got
classic shells, offshore,

50:47.626 --> 50:50.561
so no one who wasn't staring
at them would ever connect
them to True Patriot.

50:50.662 --> 50:52.220
They're similar to
the tracking accounts

50:52.331 --> 50:55.562
this Hal Leuco character
is using to go after Weed.

51:02.207 --> 51:03.265
Nice.

51:05.244 --> 51:06.541
Osterberg.

51:16.337 --> 51:19.397
Hey!
Don't shit yourself,
son. It's Just me.

51:19.507 --> 51:20.565
Hi!

51:20.675 --> 51:22.472
I look like that dude,
the one in Platoon.

51:22.577 --> 51:23.566
He's in Sniper.
"One shot, one kill!"

51:33.388 --> 51:36.653
All these gentlemen callers
competing for your attention.

51:37.358 --> 51:39.223
I like the single life.

51:42.096 --> 51:45.031
Look, this situation,
you know what they say.

51:45.500 --> 51:46.990
Two heads are
better than one.

51:47.101 --> 51:49.467
Bigger targets.
I don't need your help.

51:51.572 --> 51:53.972
Then why haven't
you killed me already?

51:58.112 --> 51:59.943
The night's still young.

52:09.824 --> 52:11.655
Well, hello, handsome.

52:27.708 --> 52:30.370
Walter, why didn't you
tell me that today,

52:30.478 --> 52:33.038
April 19th, is the day
your wife and daughter died?

52:35.783 --> 52:37.273
It hadn't
occurred to me.

52:37.385 --> 52:40.218
Someone says you're
gonna die, the last thing
you think about is the date.

52:40.321 --> 52:42.050
Something's not
right here, Walter.

52:42.790 --> 52:46.157
You know how some people,
they get a trick knee
before it rains?

52:46.260 --> 52:50.219
You see,
I get this twinge in my gut
and it's never let me down,

52:51.199 --> 52:55.363
and right now it's telling me
either you or this situation
is full of shit.

52:55.470 --> 52:57.097
Which one is it? Is it?
That's outrageous,
Agent Baker.

52:57.205 --> 53:00.072
Yes, and I resent
what you're implying.

53:01.809 --> 53:05.108
I have given the better
part of my life to this
bureau and my country.

53:05.813 --> 53:07.940
You have no right to
speak to me this way.

53:09.183 --> 53:12.584
Hey, paesan.
You check out the Latina
at the bar, man?

53:13.621 --> 53:16.385
Sexy as fuck, but man,
I don't trust it.

53:16.491 --> 53:20.052
It's got this serious-ass
black-widow vibe type thing.

53:20.161 --> 53:23.494
I don't know about her
bullet-head boyfriend,
either.

53:24.966 --> 53:26.092
Dom.

53:26.200 --> 53:27.599
I'll keep an eye on her.

53:28.302 --> 53:30.566
What's with you, man?
You okay?

53:32.173 --> 53:33.401
I'm fine.

53:35.643 --> 53:37.133
All right, man.

53:42.950 --> 53:45.680
Come on, come on.
Move your sorry ass.

53:47.188 --> 53:48.815
Time is a-wasting.

53:53.761 --> 53:55.353
All right, spuds.

53:56.531 --> 53:57.623
Fire in the hole.

54:01.502 --> 54:03.493
-What the hell was that?
-What?

54:03.604 --> 54:05.469
Oh, fuck. Where's our generator?

54:05.573 --> 54:07.131
Are you serious?

54:12.980 --> 54:16.609
Everybody be cool.
A little power outage.
Happens all the time.

54:20.321 --> 54:22.016
Go with me on this.

54:24.158 --> 54:26.649
Everybody freeze.
This woman's
a wanted criminal.

54:26.761 --> 54:28.558
Who the fuck are you?
Mike Gooding, FBI.

54:28.663 --> 54:31.325
I've been following
this woman for three days.
She's a wanted murderer.

54:31.432 --> 54:33.332
Now get Baker
on the line.

54:33.434 --> 54:34.867
Baker, you getting this?

54:35.036 --> 54:36.731
Baker, do you copy?

54:37.672 --> 54:41.267
Dom, did you get
a movement order on this?
Is he with you?

54:45.680 --> 54:46.738
Man, fuck this.

54:47.648 --> 54:52.278
Everybody relax,
this fucking second.

54:53.621 --> 54:56.419
Deep breaths, dry palms.

54:58.059 --> 55:00.425
We're gonna take care
of the situation.

55:00.528 --> 55:03.395
I want everybody
within the sound
of my voice

55:03.497 --> 55:06.057
to place their weapons
on the ground.

55:07.602 --> 55:08.762
Slowly.

55:55.549 --> 55:57.380
I believe we's ranged.

56:01.589 --> 56:03.056
-Reload!
-Yeah!

56:39.727 --> 56:41.319
Oh, shit!

56:55.743 --> 56:58.610
Someone's
compromised this operation.

57:03.150 --> 57:06.051
We were invisible.
We were fucking invisible.

57:26.674 --> 57:28.232
Wait!
Wait till it's safe!

57:28.342 --> 57:29.809
I'm not paid
to play safe.

57:29.910 --> 57:30.968
Fuck!

58:23.012 --> 58:23.979
Shit!

58:34.189 --> 58:36.282
I should've
listened to you.

58:37.893 --> 58:39.952
Not my strong suit,
I guess.

58:40.062 --> 58:41.495
It never was.

58:48.871 --> 58:50.634
Dumare,
where is my overwatch?

58:50.739 --> 58:52.604
-Nick?
-Link's still down, sir.

58:52.708 --> 58:55.472
Can anybody up there hear me?
Osterberg? Abrego? Somebody?

58:55.577 --> 58:57.704
Copy that, Chief.
Our door is still sealed.

58:57.813 --> 58:58.973
Locking mechanism unaffected.

58:59.081 --> 59:00.105
You hold your position.

59:00.215 --> 59:02.547
You kill anything
you don't know.
You understand me?

59:02.651 --> 59:04.118
Jules, overwatch
is down or dead.

59:04.219 --> 59:05.982
I need full response,
all available agents.

59:06.088 --> 59:07.419
I repeat,
full armed response.

59:07.523 --> 59:09.457
Copy, Chicago field
office deploying now.

59:09.558 --> 59:10.957
Send me everything you got.
We're under siege here.

59:11.060 --> 59:12.459
I'm on it.
Are you okay?

59:12.561 --> 59:13.823
No, not at all.

59:14.029 --> 59:15.087
Fuck!

59:15.698 --> 59:16.926
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

59:17.032 --> 59:19.193
Yeah, baby, go wide!
Hit the deck!

59:19.568 --> 59:22.628
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

59:39.655 --> 59:41.589
Hey! Check this one out!

59:47.863 --> 59:49.524
That's not
a close-quarters weapon.

59:49.631 --> 59:51.929
You could've
killed us all,
shit for brains!

59:52.034 --> 59:53.023
God damn it!

59:53.135 --> 59:55.194
And that's for taking
the Lord's name in vain.

59:55.671 --> 59:57.161
I've been shot.

59:57.973 --> 01:00:02.069
I've been gut shot.
Abrego, please. Can't you see
I'm dying out here.

01:00:02.177 --> 01:00:04.236
Baker, I got Dumare
on the other side
of the elevator door.

01:00:04.346 --> 01:00:05.472
-Open the goddamn door!
-He's hit.

01:00:05.581 --> 01:00:07.549
He needs medical
attention immediately.

01:00:08.550 --> 01:00:10.518
What the hell is he
doing down there?

01:00:11.353 --> 01:00:13.150
Dom, what are you
doing in the bar?

01:00:13.255 --> 01:00:14.779
Why aren't you
at your post?

01:00:15.624 --> 01:00:18.616
What's he doing?
Abrego, keep that
door sealed.

01:00:19.161 --> 01:00:22.130
What are you talking about?
He's hit. He's in a bad
fucking way, man.

01:00:22.231 --> 01:00:23.755
Bullshit! Stand down, Abrego.

01:00:23.866 --> 01:00:25.561
What, are you fucking nuts?
We gotta get him out of there.

01:00:25.667 --> 01:00:26.861
Not till Baker
gives the okay.

01:00:26.969 --> 01:00:28.129
Do not open that door.

01:00:29.838 --> 01:00:31.465
I'm feeling cold,

01:00:33.242 --> 01:00:35.403
and I know
that's really bad.

01:00:41.650 --> 01:00:42.981
Wait, wait.

01:00:57.132 --> 01:00:58.156
Now.

01:01:52.988 --> 01:01:54.478
My eyeholes!

01:02:40.369 --> 01:02:41.597
Oh, dear me.

01:02:44.806 --> 01:02:46.034
Baby Boy.

01:02:50.145 --> 01:02:51.772
You did real good.

01:02:58.654 --> 01:03:01.885
There's a time
for tears, Daddy,
but this ain't it.

01:03:02.824 --> 01:03:06.624
There's money
for the taking.
$3,000,000 worth.

01:03:16.672 --> 01:03:18.071
Do not open that door.

01:03:18.173 --> 01:03:19.731
Step away, man.

01:03:19.875 --> 01:03:21.342
Open the door.

01:03:21.843 --> 01:03:23.606
It's fucking Dom, Now!
for Christ's sakes.

01:03:23.712 --> 01:03:25.771
I am not letting him die
three fucking feet from me.

01:03:25.881 --> 01:03:27.815
Abrego. Stand down now!

01:03:33.188 --> 01:03:35.349
Abrego,
this is a direct order.
Hold on, Dom!

01:03:35.457 --> 01:03:37.721
Do not open that door!
Do you understand me?

01:03:37.826 --> 01:03:38.884
Fuck.

01:03:41.163 --> 01:03:42.494
I'm coming!

01:03:47.836 --> 01:03:49.303
What the fuck, Dom?

01:03:52.407 --> 01:03:53.396
You're not Dom.

01:04:22.838 --> 01:04:25.170
Sir, I've got gunfire
in the stairwell.

01:04:26.908 --> 01:04:28.876
Proceed with
extreme prejudice.

01:04:28.977 --> 01:04:30.877
You are our last
line of defense.

01:04:36.785 --> 01:04:39.811
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

01:04:40.155 --> 01:04:43.591
It's me! It's Dumare!
I think I'm hit!
These guys are on my ass!

01:04:43.692 --> 01:04:45.182
I'm coming out!

01:04:51.967 --> 01:04:53.059
Hell!

01:05:08.383 --> 01:05:09.782
Jules, where's my backup?

01:05:09.885 --> 01:05:11.716
They're en route.
But, Zane, listen to me,
the contractors...

01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:13.253
Jules, the fucking
ceiling is coming down.

01:05:13.355 --> 01:05:16.688
The assassins targeting
Weed all have extensive
government kill sheets.

01:05:16.791 --> 01:05:18.691
Wetwork for Uncle Sam.

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:21.224
So you're saying
that they've targeted US
government agents before?

01:05:21.329 --> 01:05:22.591
No, that's Just it.

01:05:22.697 --> 01:05:24.688
All of the vendors
have been classified
"liquidator,"

01:05:24.799 --> 01:05:27.597
and at one point or another
have engaged in illegal
covert activity

01:05:27.702 --> 01:05:29.636
for the US government.

01:05:30.305 --> 01:05:32.796
Do you hear me?
They've worked for us.

01:05:32.908 --> 01:05:33.932
Jules? Jules?

01:05:34.042 --> 01:05:35.009
Shit.

01:05:58.934 --> 01:06:00.629
You've been lugging that
damn rocket around

01:06:00.735 --> 01:06:04.762
like a Afghani at
a fucking Bar Mitzvah!
Shoot that sucker!

01:06:05.373 --> 01:06:08.467
Hold on! Hold on down there!
Hold your fire for a second!

01:06:09.693 --> 01:06:12.355
Any of you want to see
my sister's tits?

01:06:12.930 --> 01:06:14.056
What?

01:06:17.968 --> 01:06:19.230
How far away
is tactical response?

01:06:19.336 --> 01:06:20.360
It's 20 out.

01:06:20.471 --> 01:06:21.563
Local PD's onsite
in three.

01:06:21.672 --> 01:06:23.663
Just stay on it.
Get my line back up.

01:06:28.379 --> 01:06:29.937
What the fuck is that?

01:06:30.114 --> 01:06:31.172
Sir?

01:06:38.989 --> 01:06:42.117
I'm a businessman.
I'm here to negotiate
with Mr. Weed.

01:06:44.228 --> 01:06:45.217
Stand down.

01:06:45.329 --> 01:06:47.593
Relinquish your weapon and
get in the prone position.

01:06:47.698 --> 01:06:50.758
If you don't let me in,
your man's no use to me.

01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:54.869
Deal or no deal?

01:06:54.972 --> 01:06:55.996
No deal.

01:06:57.474 --> 01:06:59.066
God damn it, Bake.
Open the door.

01:06:59.176 --> 01:07:00.165
Shut up.

01:07:00.277 --> 01:07:01.505
You're wasting time,
and he's losing blood.

01:07:05.716 --> 01:07:08.685
No matter what you do,
I will not open this door

01:07:08.786 --> 01:07:11.914
and if you kill that man,
I swear to God,
I will hunt you down.

01:07:12.022 --> 01:07:14.991
Repeat. I will hunt
you down like a dog

01:07:15.092 --> 01:07:16.957
and kill you if it's
the last thing I do.

01:07:17.061 --> 01:07:19.052
I'll make sure
that it is.

01:07:26.203 --> 01:07:28.103
Will that door hold?
It's got to.

01:07:28.205 --> 01:07:31.436
If our intel's correct,
three minutes,
it's roll credits.

01:07:31.542 --> 01:07:33.874
If he's not dead
at 3:00 a.m. exactly,
there's no payment.

01:07:33.978 --> 01:07:37.311
Cheer up, Houdini.
You're about to
live through this.

01:07:38.849 --> 01:07:42.012
Y'all mind if I crash
your little party?

01:07:43.053 --> 01:07:44.111
Eeny...

01:07:44.221 --> 01:07:46.086
Walter!
...meeny...

01:07:48.226 --> 01:07:49.557
...miny...

01:07:55.333 --> 01:07:56.493
...moe.

01:08:06.126 --> 01:08:07.991
Walter, you okay?
Yes.

01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:11.188
Nick.

01:08:12.232 --> 01:08:15.793
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Oh, shit.

01:08:16.803 --> 01:08:18.737
Look, okay, okay.
No, no. No, no.
No. No, no.

01:08:18.837 --> 01:08:20.805
No, no, no. Cover his chest,
cover his chest,
cover his chest.

01:08:20.907 --> 01:08:22.602
Cover his chest.
Wound. Right here.
Wound, wound, wound.

01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:24.267
Okay, look at me.
Breathe. Breathe.
You're okay.

01:08:24.377 --> 01:08:26.345
What is happening to me?
No, no, you'll...

01:08:26.446 --> 01:08:28.505
No, no.
Lay down, lay down.

01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:31.841
-No, no. No. No, no.
-Just breathe. Come on.

01:08:31.951 --> 01:08:33.942
No, no. Open your eyes.
Come on, Nick.
Come on, Nick.

01:08:34.053 --> 01:08:35.850
Come on.

01:08:35.955 --> 01:08:37.546
Come on. Come on.

01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:41.518
Fuck!

01:08:59.011 --> 01:09:03.038
Hit him again, lummox.
Two more minutes and
we're shit out of luck.

01:09:09.154 --> 01:09:10.417
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:09:10.523 --> 01:09:11.683
Get away from
that goddamn door.

01:09:11.791 --> 01:09:12.779
Hey, hey, hey.

01:09:12.892 --> 01:09:14.654
This is
a dead man's switch.

01:09:14.761 --> 01:09:16.353
There's enough
C-4 explosives
wired to my chair

01:09:16.462 --> 01:09:18.260
to bring down
this entire bunker.

01:09:18.363 --> 01:09:22.198
If I release this button,
it detonates the explosives.

01:09:23.236 --> 01:09:24.260
Okay, okay.

01:09:24.370 --> 01:09:25.359
I can take him.

01:09:25.505 --> 01:09:27.473
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey. Take three steps
back, okay?

01:09:27.573 --> 01:09:28.598
Just stand down.
Just hold on.

01:09:28.707 --> 01:09:30.335
Requesting permission
to terminate target.

01:09:30.443 --> 01:09:31.466
No, Red.

01:09:31.578 --> 01:09:34.274
Stand down. Red!
He is a goddamn
suicide bomber, Bake.

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:35.506
A dozen men are dead.

01:09:35.615 --> 01:09:36.639
Red! No!

01:09:38.384 --> 01:09:39.442
Whoa!

01:09:40.787 --> 01:09:43.984
All right?
Everything's cool.
Everything's cool.

01:09:44.424 --> 01:09:45.652
Red, you okay?

01:09:45.925 --> 01:09:49.224
Do I look like
I'm fucking okay?
No, you just shot me!

01:09:49.328 --> 01:09:50.921
See? Red's okay.

01:09:52.999 --> 01:09:55.524
Walter, you're
a government official.

01:09:56.536 --> 01:09:58.299
You're about to
murder your own.

01:09:58.404 --> 01:10:00.099
For the greater good.

01:10:00.206 --> 01:10:02.606
There are men
outside that door

01:10:02.709 --> 01:10:04.643
that are wanted
enemy combatants

01:10:04.744 --> 01:10:07.304
directly aligned
against our country.

01:10:07.747 --> 01:10:10.511
They have engaged in
the most heinous acts

01:10:10.617 --> 01:10:13.142
ever perpetrated
against the United States.

01:10:13.786 --> 01:10:20.658
In 40 years, I have
never had the opportunity
to do anything heroic.

01:10:21.528 --> 01:10:23.519
Walter,
this isn't heroic.

01:10:24.831 --> 01:10:26.731
This is sanctioned murder.

01:10:26.833 --> 01:10:29.199
You're sweeping up for
somebody, Walter, okay?

01:10:29.302 --> 01:10:32.169
Hal Leuco fed you a line
of bullshit, and now
they're using you, Walter.

01:10:32.272 --> 01:10:35.435
I am not being used.
I lied to you.

01:10:35.542 --> 01:10:37.908
I am well aware
of True Patriot,

01:10:38.011 --> 01:10:42.345
a vicious, coordinated
assault by animals
like Finbar McTeague

01:10:42.448 --> 01:10:45.713
conducting tortures
in the name of
American interests.

01:10:45.818 --> 01:10:48.286
He stages these sessions,
photographs them,

01:10:48.388 --> 01:10:50.549
and disseminates
the pictures
around the world.

01:10:50.657 --> 01:10:52.955
And Ariella Martinez,
mercenary,

01:10:53.192 --> 01:10:56.684
well-versed
in exotic poisons
and toxicology.

01:10:56.796 --> 01:11:00.857
She liquidates
a Russian dissident
with radioactive poison

01:11:00.967 --> 01:11:04.459
used only
by the US military.

01:11:08.775 --> 01:11:14.042
Lazlo Soot.
He murders an Iraqi family
and pins it on a US soldier.

01:11:15.181 --> 01:11:16.876
Those crazed hillbillies,
the Tremors?

01:11:16.983 --> 01:11:19.543
The True Patriot
is a fabrication.
Hal Leuco made it up.

01:11:19.652 --> 01:11:22.212
They blew up
a train station
in Spain.

01:11:22.322 --> 01:11:25.291
It swayed a major election,
voted in a liberal president,

01:11:25.391 --> 01:11:27.484
who then pulled his
support on the Iraqi war.

01:11:27.594 --> 01:11:30.995
191 people were killed today,
and more than 2,000 were...

01:11:31.097 --> 01:11:35.056
It seems the train targeted by the bombers
were either in station or...

01:11:42.075 --> 01:11:45.272
These are cold-blooded
mercenaries and killers

01:11:45.578 --> 01:11:48.240
in open warfare
against our government.

01:11:49.082 --> 01:11:52.950
They have been sent
a contract on me
to lure them here,

01:11:53.353 --> 01:11:56.982
where I can terminate
all of them.

01:11:57.090 --> 01:11:58.682
Okay, Walter,
wait a minute.

01:11:58.791 --> 01:12:01.851
Everything you know about
True Patriot is a lie.

01:12:03.196 --> 01:12:07.565
Yes. Hal Leuco,
whoever or whatever
the fuck he is,

01:12:07.667 --> 01:12:10.795
he's been planning
on using you for months,
maybe even years in advance.

01:12:10.903 --> 01:12:13.770
Yes, Walter.
They planted
these stories.

01:12:13.873 --> 01:12:17.536
They stitched them
together to get you
here to this moment.

01:12:19.579 --> 01:12:21.308
It's blowback, Walter.

01:12:21.414 --> 01:12:24.679
Everyone you mentioned,
all those enemy combatants,

01:12:24.817 --> 01:12:26.944
yeah, they've done some
sinister things, Walter,

01:12:27.053 --> 01:12:31.581
but on behalf of
the US government, and
now they want them dead.

01:12:32.792 --> 01:12:36.592
Do you see
what's happening here?
This isn't about patriotism.

01:12:37.630 --> 01:12:39.359
This is about
No. eradication.

01:12:39.465 --> 01:12:41.092
Yes, and that's what
they're doing to you,
Walter.

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:42.997
No. Don't let them. Don't.

01:12:43.102 --> 01:12:47.402
My wife and my daughter
were taken from me.

01:12:48.474 --> 01:12:50.738
By what? Chance?

01:12:54.614 --> 01:12:58.072
Ideas live on, Agent Baker.
People don't.

01:13:00.219 --> 01:13:04.553
And when I roll out
that door and detonate
these explosives,

01:13:05.858 --> 01:13:07.826
I Join
the grid of destiny.

01:13:08.728 --> 01:13:13.927
I will be remembered.
I will be history.

01:13:15.968 --> 01:13:17.595
You have a choice.

01:13:19.572 --> 01:13:21.335
Destiny's plaything,

01:13:22.909 --> 01:13:24.536
or avenging angel?

01:13:30.450 --> 01:13:33.715
Please don't do this.
Please don't do this,
Walter.

01:13:34.554 --> 01:13:36.749
Walter, please. Fuck.

01:13:47.166 --> 01:13:48.758
Come on. Come on.

01:14:28.307 --> 01:14:29.501
Help me.

01:14:33.579 --> 01:14:35.012
Help me, boy.

01:14:38.050 --> 01:14:44.421
Help me.
Help me. Help me, boy.

01:14:44.524 --> 01:14:46.822
I'll help you,
you old fucker.

01:15:57.263 --> 01:15:59.128
Sir?
Sir, are you okay?

01:16:06.806 --> 01:16:08.797
Hey, buddy,
you all right?

01:16:28.728 --> 01:16:30.218
Gun! He's got a gun!

01:16:30.329 --> 01:16:31.455
Whoa! I'm Agent Baker.
I'm in charge.

01:16:31.564 --> 01:16:33.589
Don't. Don't move.
Get down on the ground.
Get down on the ground.

01:16:33.699 --> 01:16:35.530
Get off him!
He's FBI.

01:16:35.801 --> 01:16:39.066
You four,
lock this place down,
check for survivors.

01:16:39.238 --> 01:16:42.173
See to Lester Young there
while you're at it.

01:16:42.575 --> 01:16:45.635
Agent Baker,
I'm Special Agent
Anthony Vejar.

01:16:45.745 --> 01:16:47.144
I know you've
been through hell,
but I'm out of time.

01:16:47.246 --> 01:16:48.474
Where's Walter Weed?

01:16:48.581 --> 01:16:49.605
He's dead.

01:16:49.715 --> 01:16:52.980
You can verify that?
You saw him die?
You saw a body?

01:16:53.085 --> 01:16:55.553
He blew himself up
into a million pieces.

01:16:55.655 --> 01:16:57.179
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

01:16:57.290 --> 01:17:00.418
Did you see a body?
Did you actually
see him die?

01:17:02.395 --> 01:17:05.660
He was sitting on enough C-4
to level downtown Chicago.

01:17:05.765 --> 01:17:09.030
He was a suicide bomber.
There's no body to recover.

01:17:11.737 --> 01:17:15.935
We have reason to believe
that Walter Weed
was Hal Leuco.

01:17:17.009 --> 01:17:18.067
What?

01:17:19.245 --> 01:17:22.043
We think Leuco was
some sort of cleanup man,

01:17:22.148 --> 01:17:26.517
taking care of old assets
like the Tremors, McTeague,
Lazlo Soot,

01:17:26.886 --> 01:17:29.446
in order to eradicate
any link to True Patriot,

01:17:29.555 --> 01:17:31.386
anyone he'd dealt
with personally.

01:17:31.490 --> 01:17:33.424
There's an element
of shadow government
behind this.

01:17:33.526 --> 01:17:36.427
CIA, NSA,
agency in the black.

01:17:36.529 --> 01:17:40.158
It's unclear,
but you and your men
were used, co-opted.

01:17:40.266 --> 01:17:43.099
Okay, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

01:17:43.202 --> 01:17:45.466
My team did an extensive
background check.

01:17:45.972 --> 01:17:48.440
They tracked Weed
all the way back
to his childhood.

01:17:48.541 --> 01:17:50.566
He worked for the agency,
for God's sakes.

01:17:50.676 --> 01:17:52.644
It was all fabricated.

01:17:52.745 --> 01:17:55.543
Leuco papered, disseminated
information in the agency

01:17:55.648 --> 01:17:58.116
to create
the illusion of Weed.

01:17:58.250 --> 01:18:00.684
Hal Leuco isn't
even a real name.

01:18:00.786 --> 01:18:05.917
It's short for
Haliaeetus leucocephalus.
It's Latin for "bald eagle."

01:18:07.326 --> 01:18:08.928
You want bald eagles
on your playing cards,
I think you've earned it.

01:18:08.928 --> 01:18:11.192
You want bald eagles
on your playing cards,
I think you've earned it.

01:18:11.764 --> 01:18:15.723
The assassins,
the money we were tracking,
where did all that come from?

01:18:15.835 --> 01:18:18.963
As Walter Weed,
Leuco had access
to bureau intel,

01:18:19.438 --> 01:18:21.406
everything we'd been
working on domestically.

01:18:21.507 --> 01:18:26.035
As Hal Leuco, he was
privy to more than
his share of CIA ops.

01:18:26.278 --> 01:18:29.247
We were a week away from
proving the connection
between the two

01:18:29.348 --> 01:18:31.612
when this happened.

01:18:33.052 --> 01:18:36.385
$3,000,000.
That is mmm-mmm good.

01:18:36.822 --> 01:18:38.585
I'm glad.

01:18:38.691 --> 01:18:40.591
How could he get away
with two identities,

01:18:40.693 --> 01:18:43.355
working at the highest
level of intelligence?

01:18:43.462 --> 01:18:47.193
Leuco is a ghost,
a will-o'-the-wisp.

01:18:47.299 --> 01:18:48.459
Now you see him,
now you don't.

01:18:49.502 --> 01:18:52.733
That's why I needed to know,
did you see him die?

01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:56.173
Are you sure?

01:18:59.712 --> 01:19:02.010
How could he
survive that blast?

01:19:23.102 --> 01:19:24.569
How the hell
did you do that?

01:19:24.670 --> 01:19:27.230
I can't tell you that.
It'll spoil it.

01:19:31.911 --> 01:19:33.105
Son of a bitch.

01:20:02.508 --> 01:20:06.103
Southside bar owner
Malcolm Little had
no idea this morning

01:20:06.212 --> 01:20:07.509
that his place of business

01:20:07.613 --> 01:20:10.582
would be the scene
of a massive
gas leak explosion.

01:20:10.683 --> 01:20:12.548
Firefighters are
on the scene...
