00:32.447 --> 00:33.300
Ethan,

00:34.513 --> 00:38.734
How do you know
that what you're saying is true?

00:44.171 --> 00:48.017
You're asking me to
tell you what is real and what isn't?

00:50.054 --> 00:52.054
I know what happened.

00:53.664 --> 00:55.618
I know what my father did!

00:56.008 --> 00:57.818
And I know what
you're trying to do!

00:57.843 --> 01:00.656
Ethan, your disease has
altered your memory.

01:00.681 --> 01:02.781
Unknowingly to you, of course.

01:03.468 --> 01:05.822
But it's...it's there in
place to keep you happy.

01:06.084 --> 01:07.337
That's bullshit!

01:07.361 --> 01:10.606
You're using what condition
I had against me so no one will find out.

01:10.631 --> 01:14.156
That is not true! We are here...Ethan...

01:14.751 --> 01:15.976
Is my father in there?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.271
Ethan, sit down.

01:19.356 --> 01:21.322
-Dad?
-We have a situation.

01:21.619 --> 01:23.619
Are you in there?

01:23.643 --> 01:26.513
Huh?
Can you see me?

01:27.018 --> 01:28.825
Can you see your son?

01:29.365 --> 01:31.341
You promised me!

01:32.567 --> 01:34.095
You promised!

01:35.101 --> 01:36.711
Give me my life back!

02:48.602 --> 02:49.460
Ethan?

02:50.855 --> 02:51.678
Ethan...

02:52.905 --> 02:55.623
OK...Ethan, Ethan!

02:56.952 --> 02:58.079
Come on, say something.

02:59.489 --> 03:00.171
Come on...

03:00.908 --> 03:01.969
Who are you?

03:08.399 --> 03:09.624
Let me help you up.

03:10.070 --> 03:11.565
Let me help you up.

03:11.834 --> 03:12.625
Easy. You can do it.

03:12.650 --> 03:13.785
Easy...easy...careful, careful. Here.

03:13.821 --> 03:16.718
He's experiencing temporary
memory loss.

03:19.439 --> 03:20.894
He'll be OK.

03:21.681 --> 03:23.328
You know, I've been
meaning to ask you something.

03:25.041 --> 03:26.955
Was this ever about him?

03:28.369 --> 03:30.117
Or was it always just about you?

03:35.345 --> 03:36.728
Charles...

03:37.187 --> 03:38.633
He's your son.

03:38.657 --> 03:40.123
I'm well aware of that, Nick.

03:40.148 --> 03:41.428
You did this to him, Charles.

03:41.453 --> 03:45.801
This is serious,OK? This isn't a cold.
-He's going to be OK.

04:32.901 --> 04:34.061
No, that's just storage.

04:34.925 --> 04:36.234
Uh...your room's upstairs.

04:36.949 --> 04:38.563
I'll show you.

04:57.148 --> 04:58.688
These are all my things.

04:59.109 --> 05:01.008
Yeah. Yeah, they are.

05:04.552 --> 05:06.015
What else do you remember?

05:07.336 --> 05:08.896
I don't know
if I can keep doing this.

05:09.515 --> 05:10.783
Doing what?

05:12.751 --> 05:14.577
Telling you how I feel.

05:15.347 --> 05:16.257
Why?

05:18.283 --> 05:21.736
Honestly, I still feel
uncomfortable calling you 'Dad'.

05:30.466 --> 05:31.661
You're gonna be OK.

05:32.842 --> 05:34.654
I think we're all gonna be OK.

05:36.839 --> 05:39.145
We all just want you
to be happy and...

05:39.471 --> 05:42.065
Please...
Hey, I just...you're here now...

05:42.403 --> 05:43.805
This is your home.

05:45.305 --> 05:48.003
I know it can't be
easy starting your life over.

05:48.339 --> 05:51.572
New home, new wife, new kids.
You seem to be doing just fine

06:05.904 --> 06:07.484
I need you to take
 those twice a day.

06:08.770 --> 06:10.330
You just got out of the hospital.

06:10.689 --> 06:12.196
Doesn't come without
side effects.

06:13.850 --> 06:15.063
What if I forget?

06:16.865 --> 06:17.596
Don't.

08:00.790 --> 08:02.172
Hey...Don't cry.

08:06.969 --> 08:08.505
I remember everything.

08:08.993 --> 08:12.799
But...I just can't feel it.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.824
I know that doesn't make any sense.
But...

08:19.413 --> 08:22.308
I mean, my head hurts sometimes
when I think about that stuff.

08:29.345 --> 08:30.933
She smiles when she's
with you.

08:32.255 --> 08:33.565
My sister.

08:35.198 --> 08:36.756
She used to be that
way all the time.

08:43.788 --> 08:44.762
You scared?

08:47.024 --> 08:47.809
No.

08:50.675 --> 08:52.675
You know I had
almost forgotten about it?

08:55.062 --> 08:55.967
Sorry.

09:06.430 --> 09:08.735
Call me when you get there.
-Mom, please.

09:31.081 --> 09:32.726
You know you're my
best friend, right?

09:45.890 --> 09:47.890
-I gotta go.
-OK.

10:12.205 --> 10:15.352
I can't believe we're
not going to see him for seven months.

10:20.467 --> 10:22.467
Why did you
go to the airport?

10:23.381 --> 10:24.454
Why?

10:24.755 --> 10:27.756
I was just curious. Jesus.

10:28.656 --> 10:29.696
That picture.

10:35.201 --> 10:36.705
I don't know who it is.

10:37.861 --> 10:38.819
You?

10:40.513 --> 10:41.274
No.

10:49.115 --> 10:50.188
By the way,

10:50.941 --> 10:52.871
mom wanted you to
have dinner with her tomorrow night.

10:52.903 --> 10:54.350
Are you? 
-I live there.

10:54.911 --> 10:56.495
It's your turn to
deal with her shit.

11:00.615 --> 11:01.609
Hey Ally.

11:06.039 --> 11:07.189
Who's in the picture?

11:11.318 --> 11:12.524
Why do you have
to do that?

11:15.566 --> 11:16.533
What?

11:17.726 --> 11:19.706
I hate it when you do this.

11:20.465 --> 11:22.418
This is not exactly been easy.

11:23.484 --> 11:25.184
Will you quit trying
to blame me?

11:25.589 --> 11:26.484
Or Ally?

11:26.916 --> 11:27.779
I don't.

11:28.572 --> 11:31.105
I don't. 
I blame your father.

11:31.519 --> 11:32.226
Oh, Jesus...

11:33.099 --> 11:36.589
Can we have one dinner without
you digging his grave, too?

11:36.614 --> 11:39.941
He did that himself.
You have no idea what it is like to

11:39.966 --> 11:42.014
love someone for twenty years

11:42.157 --> 11:46.317
And then watch them turn
and marry the next best thing.

11:47.071 --> 11:51.977
It was his responsibility to help us
through everything and...

11:52.415 --> 11:55.241
...and he let this family fall apart.

11:57.812 --> 11:59.399
Let me tell you something, Ethan.

12:00.144 --> 12:01.332
Look at me!

12:04.600 --> 12:05.995
Love makes you blind.

13:05.806 --> 13:06.921
Excuse me, miss.

13:06.946 --> 13:09.179
Uh, you dropped this.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.239
What are you doing?

16:21.279 --> 16:22.546
I thought you were asleep.

16:22.571 --> 16:23.059
Oh,

16:24.258 --> 16:26.856
what do you possibly think you're
going to find here, Ethan, huh?

16:28.410 --> 16:29.717
What happened to me?

16:30.423 --> 16:32.123
We saved your life, Ethan.

16:32.539 --> 16:35.715
I know you keep saying that, but
I really think I'm OK.

16:37.822 --> 16:39.075
I just need to know.

16:40.770 --> 16:43.038
Well, there are some
things I can't tell you.

16:44.214 --> 16:46.694
Understanding it is with a
doctor-patient relationship.

16:46.956 --> 16:48.761
What about a father-son relationship?

16:49.759 --> 16:50.782
I can't.

16:58.036 --> 16:59.192
I'm sorry.

17:01.118 --> 17:02.774
Don't come here ever again.

18:46.738 --> 18:48.138
Are you sure it was her?

18:49.028 --> 18:49.892
Yeah.

18:50.443 --> 18:51.908
Well, what'd she say?

18:53.534 --> 18:55.003
Didn't ask.

18:56.272 --> 18:57.327
Why not?

18:59.446 --> 19:01.166
Ally, I followed her.

19:01.383 --> 19:04.316
-I never done that before.
-How do you know?

19:05.316 --> 19:06.543
My memory's fine.

19:06.843 --> 19:09.125
It's-it's not like I
don't remember stuff.

19:10.636 --> 19:12.362
Like when I gave you that.

19:18.523 --> 19:20.363
If you know something,

19:21.446 --> 19:22.855
I wish you'd tell me.

19:24.513 --> 19:27.116
I wish you didn't
believe I had something to hide.

19:32.901 --> 19:33.916
OK.

19:38.176 --> 19:39.596
Have you talked to Luke?

19:39.907 --> 19:41.019
No.

19:42.491 --> 19:43.518
I miss him.

19:45.317 --> 19:46.790
I think I'm gonna go.

19:47.980 --> 19:49.029
Ethan...

19:52.341 --> 19:53.417
Our family...

19:55.752 --> 19:57.702
You're the only one
who still wants it.

19:59.636 --> 20:02.155
Let's not let that 
get between us.

20:13.928 --> 20:15.070
Shut up.

20:15.600 --> 20:18.103
Seriously? Are you really
going to bring me here? Seriously?

20:41.980 --> 20:42.714
Hi.

20:42.739 --> 20:44.134
You're Camille, right?

20:44.891 --> 20:46.334
What is it with you?

20:50.522 --> 20:51.733
What do you mean?

20:53.402 --> 20:54.943
You're stalking me.

20:57.387 --> 20:59.387
I think you're giving yourself
too much credit.

21:03.058 --> 21:04.991
No, I'm not.

21:13.999 --> 21:15.013
OK.

21:16.545 --> 21:17.621
Forget it.

21:19.135 --> 21:20.813
Sit down, Ethan.

21:22.278 --> 21:23.985
I was just kidding.

21:25.380 --> 21:27.005
How'd you know my name?

21:30.217 --> 21:32.006
Everyone knows your name.

21:44.826 --> 21:46.780
Hey, Ethan. What a
pleasant surprise.

21:46.898 --> 21:49.023
Hey, Miss Linda. 
You got a minute?

21:50.642 --> 21:51.942
Do you know Camille?

21:52.250 --> 21:54.041
I don't know. 
Maybe.

21:55.521 --> 21:56.681
Do you remember this?

21:57.757 --> 21:58.810
Look.

22:14.241 --> 22:15.561
Who's that?

22:16.637 --> 22:17.986
I don't remember that.

22:20.042 --> 22:21.153
Ethan...

22:24.726 --> 22:26.726
That...is your brother.

22:28.156 --> 22:29.507
Adam.

22:34.384 --> 22:35.686
My brother?

22:38.526 --> 22:41.555
I don't remember that,
I don't have any memory.

22:42.301 --> 22:44.053
Memory of that.

22:46.735 --> 22:48.994
Do you have anything else
about that?

22:49.563 --> 22:50.627
Ethan...

22:53.159 --> 22:56.821
I'm sure it will come back to you. 
Just give it some time.

22:58.195 --> 23:00.068
I've been told that before.

23:01.083 --> 23:02.148
Ethan.

23:05.276 --> 23:06.544
Where is he?

23:14.928 --> 23:16.716
Adam Galloway. 
I'm here to see him.

23:16.741 --> 23:19.159
I'm sorry, Ethan, you're not
 authorized to go up there.

23:19.937 --> 23:21.349
You know my name!

23:21.374 --> 23:23.039
Everyone here knows your name.

23:23.127 --> 23:25.688
You're Charles' son. 
Would you  like me to call him for you?

23:26.191 --> 23:27.737
Ethan, you can't go!

23:27.762 --> 23:28.764
Ethan!

23:32.846 --> 23:34.224
I know I have a brother!

23:34.528 --> 23:36.128
Why didn't you tell me?
Where is he?

23:36.153 --> 23:38.466
Ethan, Ethan...whoa.
Calm down, take a breath.

23:38.753 --> 23:41.246
Take a breath.
Take a breath. OK.

23:44.653 --> 23:46.106
Listen, listen...listen to me,

23:46.380 --> 23:47.371
your brother...

23:47.973 --> 23:50.119
Hey, your brother
Adam died.

23:50.716 --> 23:52.456
Your brother's dead, Ethan.

23:52.716 --> 23:55.176
Yeah. He killed himself
a little over a year ago.

23:55.470 --> 23:57.061
Let's go. 
It's going to be OK.

23:57.494 --> 23:59.215
It's going to be OK. 
Yes.

24:01.506 --> 24:03.905
It's going to be OK. Whoa,
whoa, whoa.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.058
Ethan.

24:12.862 --> 24:14.361
Ethan, you're alright.

24:16.131 --> 24:17.138
Hey! Hey.

24:17.441 --> 24:19.904
You're alright. 
You're alright.

24:26.302 --> 24:27.602
Say something.

24:29.821 --> 24:30.889
Say something.

24:31.402 --> 24:32.296
Come on.

24:32.709 --> 24:34.494
Why did she tell me that?

24:35.094 --> 24:36.921
Who told you what? 
Who?

24:38.631 --> 24:40.199
Lucas' mom.

24:40.816 --> 24:44.452
Why did she tell me?
-No, no. No. Ethan. You heard wrong.

24:45.095 --> 24:46.813
You heard wrong.

24:48.751 --> 24:50.594
No, you're alright.

24:52.605 --> 24:53.898
Let's get you home.

24:54.192 --> 24:55.671
I'm going to get you home, Ok?

24:56.216 --> 24:57.151
Ok.

25:02.365 --> 25:03.845
Come on, I got you.

25:05.111 --> 25:06.752
I'm going to get you home.

25:07.544 --> 25:08.919
You're gonna be alright.

25:09.126 --> 25:10.265
You're alright.

25:27.709 --> 25:29.151
What are those?

25:30.526 --> 25:31.918
What are you doing here?

25:33.496 --> 25:35.157
Your step-mom let me in.

25:35.520 --> 25:37.397
-She did?
-Uh-hum

25:39.625 --> 25:40.594
Excuse me.
Oh.

25:41.364 --> 25:43.160
Sorry. 
Please.

25:57.116 --> 25:59.116
It's a little cleaner 
than I remembered.

25:59.453 --> 26:01.380
You've never been in
my room before.

26:02.234 --> 26:03.307
Have you?

26:04.507 --> 26:08.320
Uh...It's a little cleaner
than I would have thought.

26:11.472 --> 26:12.940
What are you doing here?

26:17.194 --> 26:18.252
Ok...

26:18.992 --> 26:21.966
I...came to say I'm sorry.

26:22.824 --> 26:24.253
About yesterday.

26:26.475 --> 26:27.488
I'm...

26:28.554 --> 26:30.314
I'm sorry.

26:33.728 --> 26:34.753
Ok.

26:39.804 --> 26:41.694
So, you paint?

26:42.846 --> 26:43.854
No.

26:45.549 --> 26:46.995
Who did these?

26:47.939 --> 26:49.497
You ask a lot of questions.

26:50.309 --> 26:52.409
They're really beautiful, Ethan.

26:52.890 --> 26:54.693
I mess around sometimes.

26:56.714 --> 26:58.880
How come they don't have faces?

27:00.184 --> 27:01.546
I can't do faces.

27:03.943 --> 27:06.756
Have you ever read 
the poem Bellustar?

27:08.022 --> 27:10.485
I'm at the adapted play
tomorrow night.

27:10.966 --> 27:12.299
You should come.

27:12.990 --> 27:15.020
I believe you know where it is.

27:16.145 --> 27:17.147
Right.

27:18.408 --> 27:20.663
You know, you're supposed
to stand eight feet away.

27:20.840 --> 27:21.820
Hmm.

27:22.209 --> 27:24.284
So, there's a goddess in the poem

27:24.785 --> 27:26.904
also faceless. 
Laughing.

27:27.738 --> 27:30.371
My first poem 
you can't even see my face.

27:31.143 --> 27:32.170
Anyway.

27:33.697 --> 27:36.919
It's supposed to represent
the unknowable future.

27:38.230 --> 27:39.857
And it's six feet.

27:40.224 --> 27:41.484
Not eight.

27:41.997 --> 27:43.897
No, it's...it's eight.

27:55.551 --> 27:56.829
It's six.

27:59.462 --> 28:00.943
No, it's eight.

28:03.105 --> 28:04.557
You should come.

28:32.460 --> 28:34.135
Say something.

28:37.746 --> 28:39.264
Say something!

28:52.294 --> 28:53.307
Mom.

28:53.332 --> 28:54.374
What?

28:56.787 --> 28:58.001
Mom, you need help.

28:58.026 --> 28:59.314
No, I'm Ok.

28:59.990 --> 29:01.347
Mom, please.

29:02.014 --> 29:05.581
Ethan, give me some time.

29:06.648 --> 29:08.982
I'll be alright. 
I promise.

29:09.007 --> 29:10.269
Don't promise.

29:13.541 --> 29:15.187
If you don't mean it, 
don't promise.

29:15.487 --> 29:19.437
What makes you think
I'm not going to keep it?

29:31.046 --> 29:32.834
Do you have any pictures of Adam?

29:33.070 --> 29:34.266
What for?

29:34.480 --> 29:36.180
Yes or no, please.

29:36.530 --> 29:38.533
No, I don't.

29:40.063 --> 29:41.421
Mom, don't lie to me.

29:41.445 --> 29:43.236
I don't have any!

29:52.415 --> 29:54.008
You need to help mom.

29:54.968 --> 29:56.014
Why?

29:56.521 --> 29:57.894
She hates me.

29:58.487 --> 30:01.801
-'Cause she needs help.
-Don't we all?

30:04.849 --> 30:05.762
Dad.

30:06.241 --> 30:07.442
This is serious.

30:09.216 --> 30:10.570
I am serious.

30:11.855 --> 30:13.209
All she wants from me is money.

30:13.234 --> 30:15.744
So don't stand there and tell me
about how much she needs help

30:15.997 --> 30:17.230
It's a waste of time.

30:17.325 --> 30:19.325
You were married to
her for twenty years.

30:19.925 --> 30:21.490
And now we're divorced.

30:21.514 --> 30:23.347
And it's about to
happen again.

30:29.691 --> 30:31.052
Unbelievable.

30:34.238 --> 30:35.411
Look around.

30:35.738 --> 30:38.030
Like this little paradise
world you live in now?

30:39.224 --> 30:41.184
Don't get too attached to it.

30:41.671 --> 30:43.904
It will all be gone very soon.

30:45.051 --> 30:47.303
What the hell does that even mean?

30:50.346 --> 30:51.555
What does that mean?

30:53.661 --> 30:54.592
Well,

30:56.094 --> 30:57.799
it means that my good friend,

30:58.058 --> 31:00.211
my former employee, rather,

31:00.790 --> 31:01.917
Milo Sofley,

31:02.570 --> 31:04.697
has filed a lawsuit against us.

31:05.716 --> 31:06.598
Yeah...

31:07.082 --> 31:09.732
I think you met him when
you left the hospital.

31:22.164 --> 31:23.184
Dad?

31:24.633 --> 31:25.650
What?

31:27.800 --> 31:29.800
Can I live with
you from now on?

31:32.873 --> 31:34.216
What's wrong with your mother?

31:34.850 --> 31:36.522
Will you help her or not?

31:37.676 --> 31:39.621
Can I take that thing
out of your lip?

31:41.394 --> 31:43.074
I'll get my things tomorrow.

32:11.101 --> 32:12.514
What's in this room?

32:14.391 --> 32:15.915
I have no idea.

32:16.415 --> 32:17.548
Yes, you do.

32:19.758 --> 32:21.636
Ethan, what's wrong with you?

32:24.439 --> 32:26.248
Do you keep secrets, Ally?

32:27.440 --> 32:29.587
We all keep our secrets, Ethan.

32:35.574 --> 32:36.603
Yeah.

32:38.628 --> 32:39.634
Ethan?

32:39.882 --> 32:41.174
What's wrong?

32:44.080 --> 32:45.813
Why was I in the hospital?

32:46.446 --> 32:48.419
-You were sick.
-I'm serious.

32:48.788 --> 32:50.969
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

32:51.322 --> 32:52.329
I promise.

32:52.562 --> 32:53.688
I would tell you.

32:58.413 --> 33:00.080
I think the answer's in there.

33:03.123 --> 33:05.116
It's a storage room, Ethan.

33:05.601 --> 33:07.149
There are secrets.

33:10.409 --> 33:12.081
There are secrets in there.

33:16.121 --> 33:18.237
Have you been taking
your medicine?

33:25.739 --> 33:26.854
No.

33:29.085 --> 33:31.105
I think you should.

33:41.729 --> 33:43.356
Dad said he'd help her.

33:49.046 --> 33:50.707
That's good.

34:48.077 --> 34:49.380
Are you OK?

34:53.791 --> 34:55.331
Is this a dream?

34:56.808 --> 34:57.854
No.

34:57.936 --> 34:59.187
It's something else.

35:00.776 --> 35:02.348
You gotta feel in dreams.

35:03.941 --> 35:05.941
You can only imagine.

35:11.565 --> 35:13.025
Can you feel me?

35:25.715 --> 35:27.466
This is not you.

35:31.425 --> 35:33.025
This is you.

35:41.233 --> 35:43.009
I can feel you.

35:46.984 --> 35:48.531
Hold on.

36:26.387 --> 36:28.671
I'm glad you made it.
-Thank you.

36:28.696 --> 36:30.404
-Yeah. 
No problem.

36:30.796 --> 36:32.796
What did you think?

36:33.729 --> 36:35.133
It was interesting.

36:35.660 --> 36:36.760
Yes, it is.

36:39.037 --> 36:41.037
And what are you doing now?

36:42.497 --> 36:44.949
I don't know. I hadn't
really thought about it. Why?

36:44.974 --> 36:46.552
Are you sure you want to know?

36:47.132 --> 36:48.579
Ok, I'll tell you.

36:49.045 --> 36:50.645
We're having a party.

36:50.670 --> 36:53.738
I took the key from
 the hotel I work at.

36:54.484 --> 36:56.227
Isn't that illegal?

36:56.252 --> 36:58.587
No it's fine, they won't
even know we're there.

36:58.612 --> 37:00.669
Ethan, 
come on, we're leaving.

37:01.494 --> 37:02.713
You should go.

37:05.158 --> 37:06.358
Come on.

37:06.532 --> 37:07.565
It'll be fun.

37:21.048 --> 37:22.365
Hey, everybody.

37:55.356 --> 37:56.358
Ethan?

37:57.451 --> 37:58.698
Are you Ok?

37:59.520 --> 38:01.198
Yeah,
I'm fine.

38:03.571 --> 38:06.312
I've discovered something
about you, Ethan.

38:08.700 --> 38:11.040
You are a compulsive liar.

38:16.784 --> 38:18.771
You should smile more often.

38:22.440 --> 38:23.298
What?

38:23.323 --> 38:24.631
What's so funny?

38:25.860 --> 38:28.510
You're not the first
person who's told me that.

38:31.295 --> 38:33.897
Well, if I may plead
my case, Mr. Ethan.

38:36.467 --> 38:37.300
A life...

38:37.325 --> 38:38.773
is not worth living if...

38:39.340 --> 38:40.641
you don't...

38:42.385 --> 38:44.075
have something to smile about.

38:47.508 --> 38:49.508
Well, you might not be
yourself, then.

38:49.812 --> 38:53.314
Well, actually, I am a
figment of your imagination.

38:53.603 --> 38:54.608
Really?

38:55.496 --> 38:56.949
That's interesting.

38:58.501 --> 38:59.914
I would think if I...

38:59.939 --> 39:01.247
made up, then,

39:01.461 --> 39:02.642
you'd be taller.

39:03.472 --> 39:05.002
with a short skirt.

39:17.402 --> 39:19.082
It's a shame I'm real.

39:22.673 --> 39:23.910
No, it's not.

39:54.491 --> 39:55.805
Hey. What's up?

40:15.689 --> 40:16.699
Wake up!

40:19.173 --> 40:20.251
Wake up!

40:21.897 --> 40:23.281
Wake up!

42:40.261 --> 42:41.943
Where are all the
boxes that were in that room?

42:42.796 --> 42:43.830
I moved them.

42:43.855 --> 42:44.796
Where?

42:48.657 --> 42:50.477
There's something wrong
with me.

42:51.681 --> 42:53.283
Why do you think that is?

42:57.994 --> 42:59.534
You stopped taking your pills.

43:03.131 --> 43:04.371
Look at me.

43:04.396 --> 43:05.417
What?

43:07.226 --> 43:08.566
These are important.

43:08.591 --> 43:09.668
I forgot!

43:10.280 --> 43:12.280
You can forget a
lot of things, Ethan.

43:12.749 --> 43:14.176
but don't forget these.

43:14.861 --> 43:16.388
Since when do
you really care?

43:16.413 --> 43:18.222
Ethan, stop, you're
still my son. I'm still-

43:18.247 --> 43:20.247
This is not about
these fucking pills!

43:21.469 --> 43:22.916
You know something!

43:23.033 --> 43:24.415
And you've gone to
extensive links to make

43:24.440 --> 43:26.228
sure that I don't
find out about it.

43:27.501 --> 43:28.967
I can't take it anymore!

43:29.384 --> 43:32.698
You told everyone I know
never to speak about Adam?

43:32.723 --> 43:34.711
I...I know this has
something to do with

43:34.736 --> 43:36.782
the fact that I was
in the hospital.

43:37.165 --> 43:39.704
And you're the only
one who can tell me about that.

43:41.155 --> 43:42.213
Aren't you?

43:46.558 --> 43:48.218
They day your brother...

43:49.421 --> 43:51.121
...killed himself,

43:54.245 --> 43:56.245
something happened
to you, as well.

43:57.095 --> 43:58.338
Something?

44:00.923 --> 44:02.210
You're a fucking neurosurgeon,

44:02.235 --> 44:03.483
something doesn't cut it.

44:03.508 --> 44:07.241
If you want me to tell you, I
would suggest you lower your voice.

44:07.551 --> 44:08.594
Sit down.

44:22.018 --> 44:23.450
When you saw him,

44:24.228 --> 44:27.856
when you Saw Adam,

44:29.833 --> 44:32.153
an artery ruptured in your brain.

44:34.084 --> 44:37.364
And the lack of oxygen damaged

44:37.389 --> 44:40.812
some areas that are necessary
for you to properly recall your memories.

44:44.237 --> 44:46.324
You blocked out your
brother and everything

44:46.460 --> 44:48.237
having to do with him.

44:51.678 --> 44:53.678
So in essence you forgot.

44:57.603 --> 45:00.490
I need you to know
that I was trying to help you, Ethan.

45:02.333 --> 45:04.648
I thought it was best if
those things stayed forgotten.

45:04.673 --> 45:06.749
and I tried to keep
it that way.

45:11.289 --> 45:12.872
Ethan.

45:16.982 --> 45:18.982
You blamed yourself
for what happened.

45:27.276 --> 45:29.276
Do you know 
what predetermination is?

45:32.092 --> 45:33.551
Like fate?

45:35.372 --> 45:36.523
No.

45:37.315 --> 45:38.666
What do you mean?

45:40.789 --> 45:42.264
There's a difference.

45:44.245 --> 45:45.852
If you believe in fate, then

45:46.410 --> 45:48.899
all the choices you make
both right and wrong,

45:48.924 --> 45:50.510
are not yours.

45:52.596 --> 45:54.638
You think that they are, but...

45:55.265 --> 45:57.634
they happen that way
because they have to.

46:00.619 --> 46:01.646
Love?

46:02.421 --> 46:04.606
What do you believe?

46:06.859 --> 46:09.790
I'd like to believe I'm
in control of my own life.

46:11.374 --> 46:14.616
Although lately it
doesn't feel that way.

46:18.932 --> 46:21.043
There are things in place.

46:23.170 --> 46:25.014
But it's my decision...

46:27.382 --> 46:28.746
to be here.

46:32.229 --> 46:34.229
That's predetermination.

46:49.617 --> 46:50.826
Ethan...

46:50.851 --> 46:52.358
look at me.

46:53.917 --> 46:55.008
I don't...

46:55.032 --> 46:56.910
know why you...

46:56.935 --> 46:59.363
worry about these things
you can't control.

47:01.630 --> 47:02.716
Like...

47:03.165 --> 47:04.663
your past,

47:05.120 --> 47:07.216
your family,

47:08.793 --> 47:10.433
your friends.

47:15.857 --> 47:17.240
Thank you.

47:21.815 --> 47:23.181
I like it.

48:38.798 --> 48:40.798
I'm so sorry.

48:52.633 --> 48:53.740
No.

49:04.603 --> 49:06.914
Ally, Ally, whoa
whoa. Come on. Come on.

49:06.939 --> 49:08.474
Come on. Let's go back.

49:08.498 --> 49:10.888
-Alisson!
-Just leave me alone!

49:16.868 --> 49:18.139
Do you need help?

49:25.011 --> 49:26.265
Promise me

49:30.374 --> 49:31.394
Ok.

49:34.103 --> 49:36.103
I promise.

49:37.141 --> 49:39.141
I promise, baby.

49:53.039 --> 49:55.039
I'll see you in rehab.

50:28.680 --> 50:30.069
Come on.

50:53.757 --> 50:55.253
I love you.

51:03.742 --> 51:05.303
Come on.

51:05.327 --> 51:07.327
Excuse me!

51:07.351 --> 51:10.514
Um, will you take
our picture?

51:43.511 --> 51:45.254
Say I'm beautiful.

51:47.721 --> 51:49.471
I love fireworks.

52:20.907 --> 52:22.907
My body. It hurts.

52:31.931 --> 52:33.931
What are you doing here?

52:36.632 --> 52:39.567
Can you...take a
look at something for us?

52:46.595 --> 52:49.547
I was hoping you might
be able to tell me where you got it.

53:05.861 --> 53:07.861
This isn't my room.

53:13.002 --> 53:14.778
They're not in the right place.

55:36.424 --> 55:37.587
Hello, Ethan.

55:39.881 --> 55:41.547
How'd you know my name?

55:42.315 --> 55:43.982
Everyone knows your name.

55:45.336 --> 55:46.336
Who are you?

55:47.606 --> 55:49.208
My name is Dr. Milo Sofley

55:49.865 --> 55:51.821
I used to work with your father.

55:52.292 --> 55:54.445
I'm filing a lawsuit against him.

55:56.398 --> 55:58.183
I'm assuming he hasn't
told you why.

56:01.748 --> 56:02.961
No.

56:05.592 --> 56:06.776
What would you say
if I told you I knew

56:06.801 --> 56:07.867
what was happening to you?

56:09.043 --> 56:11.456
People cope with traumatic
events differently.

56:11.996 --> 56:13.669
Some are worse than others.

56:15.868 --> 56:17.684
What happened to her?

56:19.647 --> 56:22.137
This isn't about her, Ethan.

56:25.139 --> 56:26.526
This is about you.

56:29.297 --> 56:31.106
How much do you know?

56:32.402 --> 56:34.402
I know this is where
my dad works.

56:36.254 --> 56:38.567
We're nowhere near
your father now, Ethan.

56:38.841 --> 56:40.307
Or anyone else.

56:41.411 --> 56:43.172
We're in a room

56:43.196 --> 56:45.018
in my house.

56:50.905 --> 56:52.682
Then what's happening to me?

56:54.095 --> 56:56.095
Why am I seeing
what I'm seeing?

56:59.019 --> 57:00.809
You are something, Ethan.

57:01.043 --> 57:02.709
You really are.

57:05.199 --> 57:07.748
And I think it's
very admirable of you.

57:08.253 --> 57:10.652
Trying to find yourself
in such a way.

57:13.833 --> 57:16.199
Ethan, you're asking
the wrong questions.

57:17.516 --> 57:19.153
You saw the x-rays.

57:22.434 --> 57:23.852
What'd you think
that was?

57:28.853 --> 57:30.231
I don't know.

57:30.762 --> 57:32.442
It's a microcomputer.

57:32.989 --> 57:35.215
A silicon hippo campus chip.

57:36.483 --> 57:39.158
We all have memories
which we prefer to forget.

57:39.657 --> 57:41.556
Your father never told
you what he was doing

57:41.581 --> 57:43.581
because he wasn't sure
that it would work.

57:44.229 --> 57:47.243
To be honest, I think
you were in no position to argue with him.

57:48.486 --> 57:50.486
The next thing you
knew, you awoke in a hospital,

57:50.610 --> 57:52.514
unaware of any pf this.

57:53.755 --> 57:56.271
Ethan, ever since
your surgery,

57:56.469 --> 57:58.919
You've been combining your
past and your present,

57:59.476 --> 58:01.831
to create your own happiness.

58:02.432 --> 58:04.591
Your condition, Ethan,

58:04.615 --> 58:06.439
causes you to think your dreams

58:07.305 --> 58:08.980
are real life.

58:12.402 --> 58:14.088
It stopped working?

58:15.455 --> 58:17.376
Because I remembered
my brother.

58:18.309 --> 58:19.980
No, Ethan.

58:21.460 --> 58:23.150
You don't have
a brother.

58:25.044 --> 58:26.367
It was you.

59:14.697 --> 59:17.347
I need you to come
back to the real world, Ethan.

59:17.824 --> 59:20.367
I need you to trust me.

59:36.377 --> 59:37.886
This is your house.

59:39.159 --> 59:40.592
Yes, it's...

59:41.759 --> 59:43.575
...where we've
been the whole time.

59:45.378 --> 59:49.284
Do you understand everything
that I'm telling you, Ethan?

59:51.974 --> 59:55.648
This chip works as
an artificial part of your brain

59:56.698 --> 59:58.698
Because it was damaged,

59:59.528 --> 01:00:01.528
everything that you now remember

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:05.186
is directly connected to
the hippo campus chip.

01:00:12.002 --> 01:00:14.002
You are dependent on it

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:16.656
For normal functioning.

01:00:20.866 --> 01:00:23.005
I don't know what to believe.

01:00:26.908 --> 01:00:28.908
Why are you helping me?

01:00:41.621 --> 01:00:43.045
Ethan!

01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:45.580
-Ethan!
-What?

01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:48.046
What do you want
from me?

01:00:50.290 --> 01:00:52.290
We have a case, Ethan!

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:55.160
You can't fight back!

01:01:50.125 --> 01:01:51.136
Here.

01:02:08.127 --> 01:02:09.582
I know everything.

01:02:11.567 --> 01:02:12.826
Ethan...

01:02:15.041 --> 01:02:16.443
It's over.

01:03:05.766 --> 01:03:07.226
Ethan, I'm...

01:03:07.790 --> 01:03:10.068
really not in the mood
right now,

01:03:10.093 --> 01:03:11.716
can we just...
-I don't care!

01:03:13.733 --> 01:03:15.046
I have something to say.

01:03:15.071 --> 01:03:16.726
And you're gonna listen.

01:03:19.406 --> 01:03:20.991
Let go of my hand.

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:23.254
Why?

01:03:25.145 --> 01:03:26.218
Let go of my hand!

01:03:26.243 --> 01:03:28.839
Why should I listen to
anything you have to say?

01:03:29.561 --> 01:03:31.809
I haven't been in control
of my life in a long time,

01:03:31.834 --> 01:03:33.028
and I have you to
thank for that.

01:03:33.053 --> 01:03:35.543
This is ridic-
it's late!

01:03:36.464 --> 01:03:37.517
Get out of my room.

01:03:37.542 --> 01:03:39.542
I wanted to let
you know it's not working.

01:03:42.847 --> 01:03:44.536
It stopped working.

01:03:48.599 --> 01:03:49.662
Ethan...

01:03:49.694 --> 01:03:50.832
-I don't think you
understand this...

01:03:50.857 --> 01:03:53.982
-I had a talk with Milo
Sofley this afternoon...

01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:56.777
Do you know him?

01:03:57.718 --> 01:03:59.014
Don't you?

01:04:01.072 --> 01:04:02.704
What did he tell you?

01:04:02.728 --> 01:04:04.728
I know what you did.

01:04:05.435 --> 01:04:06.788
I know everything.

01:04:10.603 --> 01:04:11.975
I gave you...

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.668
a chance to s...
-No!

01:04:14.841 --> 01:04:16.672
What you gave me was...

01:04:16.697 --> 01:04:19.212
a life that wasn't my own!

01:04:22.303 --> 01:04:24.021
I don't want that!

01:04:28.481 --> 01:04:30.481
You've insulted me.

01:04:38.191 --> 01:04:39.868
I want you to take it out.

01:04:40.934 --> 01:04:43.071
-Well, I don't think you...
-if there's one thing...

01:04:43.096 --> 01:04:44.737
I will ever ask of you,

01:04:45.178 --> 01:04:46.194
This is it.

01:04:47.414 --> 01:04:48.859
I'm not broken.

01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:50.908
You cannot fix

01:04:50.932 --> 01:04:54.366
whatever it is you think
is wrong with me,

01:04:55.807 --> 01:04:57.514
I am who I am.

01:05:02.135 --> 01:05:02.998
Ethan...

01:05:03.462 --> 01:05:06.618
This chip is a major
part of your cognitive functioning.

01:05:07.186 --> 01:05:08.291
If I remove it,

01:05:10.144 --> 01:05:12.762
it'll be as if we never
had this conversation.

01:05:14.597 --> 01:05:16.806
You will not remember
any of this.

01:05:17.526 --> 01:05:19.679
-You don't know that.
-Yes, I do!

01:05:20.017 --> 01:05:22.594
It is your hippo campus. It tells
your memories where to go

01:05:22.619 --> 01:05:24.549
and how they will be remembered

01:05:25.495 --> 01:05:27.495
Without it...

01:05:29.199 --> 01:05:30.612
Ethan...

01:05:32.154 --> 01:05:34.707
Please, please, please,
for the love of God.

01:05:35.241 --> 01:05:37.116
Do not make this decision.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:38.849
Despite me.

01:05:40.932 --> 01:05:42.667
I've been there before.

01:05:43.107 --> 01:05:44.457
Haven't I?

01:05:48.287 --> 01:05:51.099
If I don't remember
any of this, then that's my decision.

01:05:53.215 --> 01:05:55.797
Ethan, please, please, please.

01:06:00.259 --> 01:06:02.682
If you won't do it,
I'll call Milo.

01:06:18.668 --> 01:06:19.917
Ok.

01:06:21.773 --> 01:06:22.848
I'll do it.

01:06:26.978 --> 01:06:28.057
I'll do it.

01:06:52.207 --> 01:06:54.822
Do you remember what
you said when you gave this to me?

01:06:58.540 --> 01:06:59.655
No.

01:07:06.027 --> 01:07:08.529
You said that it reminded
you of me.

01:07:11.435 --> 01:07:13.235
Because I was always happy.

01:07:19.926 --> 01:07:22.885
And now the blue
bird reminds me of you.

01:07:46.897 --> 01:07:48.086
Wish I had...

01:07:49.312 --> 01:07:52.564
more things that I could
remember that were happier.

01:07:58.515 --> 01:08:01.540
Truthfully you've been upset
for so long, I can't remember

01:08:02.658 --> 01:08:04.948
a time when we were happy.

01:08:09.651 --> 01:08:12.289
But that's why we're here.

01:08:14.032 --> 01:08:15.238
I felt angry...

01:08:16.005 --> 01:08:17.830
when you drank,

01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:20.613
but I still love you.

01:08:21.486 --> 01:08:22.961
I felt hurt...

01:08:23.304 --> 01:08:24.620
and lonely...

01:08:27.448 --> 01:08:29.448
when you tried to h-

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.960
when you tried to hurt yourself.

01:08:37.734 --> 01:08:39.370
But I still love you.

01:08:41.559 --> 01:08:43.408
I felt upset,

01:08:45.221 --> 01:08:46.666
I felt ashamed,

01:08:48.662 --> 01:08:51.145
when Ally told me
how she found you,

01:08:53.455 --> 01:08:55.158
But I still love you.

01:08:59.457 --> 01:09:01.343
I hate it when you lie.

01:09:12.807 --> 01:09:14.372
But I st...

01:09:17.983 --> 01:09:19.692
I still love you.

01:10:03.104 --> 01:10:04.162
Lucas!

01:10:08.737 --> 01:10:10.109
Baby, I'm so glad
you're home!

01:10:10.134 --> 01:10:11.717
It's good to be home.

01:10:11.742 --> 01:10:13.509
I missed you so much.

01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:15.657
It's good to see you.

01:10:16.681 --> 01:10:18.465
Hey man, welcome home.

01:10:18.490 --> 01:10:19.692
Ah, thanks!

01:10:54.742 --> 01:10:56.073
It's good to see you, man.

01:10:56.465 --> 01:10:57.972
It's good to be home.

01:10:58.665 --> 01:10:59.997
I'm glad you're back.

01:11:00.022 --> 01:11:01.755
-Yeah, me, too.

01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:16.388
Thanks.

01:11:20.051 --> 01:11:21.553
Let's go back
inside, alright?

01:11:24.195 --> 01:11:25.281
You coming?

01:11:28.337 --> 01:11:30.769
I think I'm going to stay
 out here for a little while.

01:15:57.222 --> 01:15:58.778
Can you see me?

01:15:59.089 --> 01:16:01.089
Can you see your son?

01:16:02.612 --> 01:16:04.612
You promised me!

01:16:05.903 --> 01:16:07.903
You promised!

01:16:25.139 --> 01:16:26.220
Milo, tell him what happened.

01:16:26.245 --> 01:16:27.745
Ethan, please, please.

01:16:28.272 --> 01:16:29.755
Just calm down.

01:16:46.424 --> 01:16:47.750
Truth...

01:16:50.221 --> 01:16:52.623
is in fact the most
important piece of information

01:16:52.648 --> 01:16:53.950
in any event with such
discrepancies

01:16:53.975 --> 01:16:55.803
as the ones we've
been faced with here.

01:17:02.265 --> 01:17:04.265
The brain is the most powerful...

01:17:04.874 --> 01:17:06.874
and fragile part of the human body.

01:17:09.277 --> 01:17:10.419
But in this case,

01:17:11.609 --> 01:17:13.609
it's the object in question.

01:17:15.973 --> 01:17:17.928
Mr. Ethan Galloway will
further undergo a

01:17:17.953 --> 01:17:19.953
series of BCI tests,

01:17:20.391 --> 01:17:23.463
which record the exact radioactivity
that his brain emits.

01:17:24.323 --> 01:17:26.809
This tests do not confabulate.

01:17:26.839 --> 01:17:28.620
And they will be done
before and after

01:17:28.645 --> 01:17:30.373
the removal of the
hippo campus chip.

01:17:32.841 --> 01:17:37.243
He's the son of Charles Galloway
whose wishes will be granted.

01:17:38.291 --> 01:17:40.892
No matter how serious
the consequences.

01:17:55.958 --> 01:17:57.055
This is it.

01:18:02.686 --> 01:18:04.832
You have to be sure
that this is really what you want

01:18:04.857 --> 01:18:06.413
before you take this pill.

01:18:11.686 --> 01:18:12.791
After this,

01:18:12.815 --> 01:18:14.815
there's no turning back.

01:19:21.538 --> 01:19:22.812
Ethan!

01:19:48.609 --> 01:19:50.962
You know I won't
remember any of this.

01:19:55.163 --> 01:19:56.398
Yes you will.
