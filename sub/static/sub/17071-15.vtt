18:37.850 --> 18:39.018
What? No --

18:39.051 --> 18:41.654
Get out of my eyeline.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.191
Let's shoot this thing!

18:46.459 --> 18:48.495
[ Sighs ]

18:50.663 --> 18:53.099
Well, that Spice Girls line
was a total nightmare.

18:53.132 --> 18:56.269
A lot more middle-aged men
than I thought. [ Chuckles ]

18:56.303 --> 18:57.837
Where were we?
Oh, right.

18:57.870 --> 19:00.607
I was just about to press
charges against your boy.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.008
You will do
no such thing.

19:02.041 --> 19:05.278
I believe my son.
He didn't steal that CD.

19:05.312 --> 19:06.613
Well, that's nice
you believe him,

19:06.646 --> 19:07.947
but there's still
no way of knowing

19:07.980 --> 19:09.682
whether the CD is really his
or if he stole it.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.017
I'm gonna call the police.

19:11.050 --> 19:14.221
16 seconds!
What?

19:14.254 --> 19:16.055
That's the exact moment
it skips on track 8.

19:16.088 --> 19:18.458
I know that
because it's my CD.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.593
What have we here?
A boom-boom box.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.530
Play it.

19:29.236 --> 19:30.537
I have to fast-forward a bit.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.639
Hold down
the right arrow button.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.640
Hold it down.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.842
I'm doing it.
There! There.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.510
* Mechanical mix flows

19:37.544 --> 19:39.078
* Competition in my dojo

19:39.111 --> 19:40.079
* In my dojo

19:40.112 --> 19:41.648
* In my dojo

19:41.681 --> 19:43.483
* In my dojo
If the CD skips,
you must acquit.

19:43.516 --> 19:46.419
* In my dojo, in my doj--
I guess it is yours.
My mistake.

19:46.453 --> 19:47.987
"My mistake"?
That's it?

19:48.020 --> 19:52.091
You falsely accused my son
of being a thief!

19:52.124 --> 19:53.226
You need
to make this right.

19:53.260 --> 19:54.594
How would I do that?

19:54.627 --> 19:57.264
You're gonna buy back
his music disc at full price.

19:57.297 --> 20:01.434
Or else I will tell everyone
that your store profiles Asians.

20:01.468 --> 20:03.336
Institutional bias.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.505
But it's a "Street Fighter"
soundtrack from two years ago,

20:05.538 --> 20:06.406
a-and it skips.

20:06.439 --> 20:07.607
No one's gonna buy it.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.041
Eddie, what's that sound like
to you?

20:09.075 --> 20:10.910
Not our problem.

20:12.579 --> 20:13.613
Fine.

20:13.646 --> 20:16.716
**

20:19.051 --> 20:20.453
Who pays for it?

20:20.487 --> 20:23.189
Howie does. Always Howie.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.090
* Yeah

20:29.061 --> 20:30.363
They said the infomercial
will air

20:30.397 --> 20:32.198
sometime between
3:00 and 6:00 a.m.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.933
Mom, will you pass
the popcorn?

20:33.966 --> 20:37.203
You're hungry? I'm surprised
you're not full of papaya.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.139
I said I was sorry.
Can't a boy have a hankering?

20:40.172 --> 20:42.208
I can't believe
you're gonna be on TV, Emery.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.478
Thanks, Eddie. I'm glad
 somebody's happy about it.

20:45.512 --> 20:48.648
[ Sighs ] I told you,
I wasn't trying to sabotage you.

20:48.681 --> 20:51.318
Hmm.
Finally, some good acting.

20:53.252 --> 20:57.724
Announcer:
 Tired of chopped onions turning
 you into a whiny crybaby?

20:57.757 --> 21:00.393
[ Baby cries ]

21:00.427 --> 21:02.962
Are you a dumb idiot, wasting
 everyone's time and money,

21:02.995 --> 21:04.731
cutting onions
 the old-fashioned way?

21:04.764 --> 21:06.098
Uh, duh.

21:06.132 --> 21:09.135
Presenting a better way.

21:09.168 --> 21:10.770
Hi. Tony Wonder here

21:10.803 --> 21:13.239
with a miracle machine
 that makes chopping onions

21:13.272 --> 21:15.174
as easy
 as pulling the trigger.

21:15.207 --> 21:16.676
It's called...

21:16.709 --> 21:18.110
"The Gunion."

21:19.612 --> 21:21.648
They stole my name!

21:25.485 --> 21:28.054
[ Laughs ]
