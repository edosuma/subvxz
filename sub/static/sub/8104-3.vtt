00:05.130 --> 00:08.549
I didn't sleep well last night,
and I woke up with a scratchy throat.

00:08.676 --> 00:09.967
I just don't feel so good.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.472
Cough.

00:14.848 --> 00:19.227
I have a bit of an upset stomach, too,
and I think I'm running a fever.

00:19.353 --> 00:23.815
I'm just worried I might be contagious.

00:23.941 --> 00:28.820
Inventory. Tomorrow, I'm... Yeah, I'm
sure I'll be feeling better by then.

00:29.780 --> 00:31.698
Thanks, Mr. Innabe.

00:34.910 --> 00:37.578
I cannot believe
you just did that.

00:37.705 --> 00:40.498
I... I really do have a cough.

00:40.624 --> 00:42.792
So you weren't lying.

00:42.918 --> 00:46.462
You'd be curled up in bed
with a bowl of chicken soup

00:47.798 --> 00:49.882
even if you didn't have
a horny girl in your bed?

00:50.008 --> 00:52.760
Yes.
Because I really do...

00:52.886 --> 00:55.888
Hey, I really
do have a cough.

00:56.014 --> 00:58.391
You also have a little rash.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.605
I'm not sure we
should be kissing.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.524
It's okay.

01:06.650 --> 01:09.944
Because I have almost
no interest in kissing you.

01:18.829 --> 01:21.330
Oh, baby.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.491
Brandon.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.120
Brandon.

02:03.707 --> 02:05.875
I know I'm good, but come on.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.801
Brandon. Brandon. Brandon.

02:15.594 --> 02:18.304
Brandon. Brandon.

02:52.548 --> 02:56.926
Any additional RN
to Surgical.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.110
Why do you want me to treat him?

03:14.236 --> 03:16.320
Blood pressure's not responding
to IV fluids.

03:16.446 --> 03:19.031
No, no. I didn't ask how you
plan to con me into treating him,

03:19.157 --> 03:21.742
I asked you why you
want me to treat him.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.245
He's sick. I care. I'm pathetic.

03:24.371 --> 03:27.164
There are about a billion sick people
on the planet. Why this one?

03:27.291 --> 03:29.458
Because this one's
in our emergency room.

03:29.585 --> 03:31.085
So it's a proximity issue.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.087
If somebody was sick
in the third-floor stairwell,

03:33.213 --> 03:34.589
that's who'd we be talking about.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.466
I checked the stairwell. It's clear.

03:37.593 --> 03:40.052
Okay, then. Emergency-room guy it is.

03:40.178 --> 03:43.806
- Wait. Why was that so easy?
- You know why.

03:45.142 --> 03:47.560
Blood pressure's not responding
to IV fluids?

03:47.686 --> 03:49.228
Yeah.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.148
That's just weird.

03:54.151 --> 03:57.737
CBC was unremarkable. Abdominal
CT scan didn't show anything,

03:57.863 --> 04:00.323
so, people, differential diagnosis.
What's wrong with her?

04:00.449 --> 04:02.491
- Him.
- Him, her. Does it matter?

04:02.618 --> 04:05.328
Does anyone think
it's a testicular problem?

04:05.454 --> 04:07.580
- So, Chase?
- Yersinia infection?

04:07.706 --> 04:09.707
No. You wouldn't get
the rash or cough.

04:09.833 --> 04:13.210
What about arthritis? Accompanying
vasculitis causes nerve damage.

04:13.337 --> 04:15.713
It wouldn't cause the blood pressure
problems. Allergy?

04:15.839 --> 04:18.049
The kid's got abdominal pain.
Maybe carcinoid?

04:18.175 --> 04:19.884
No, but then you
wouldn't get the...

04:20.010 --> 04:22.094
Foreman, if you're going to list
all the things it's not,

04:22.220 --> 04:24.180
it might be quicker
to do it alphabetically.

04:24.306 --> 04:27.183
Let's see, now.
Absidia. Excellent.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.226
Doesn't account for any of the symptoms.

04:29.353 --> 04:31.145
No condition accounts
for all these symptoms.

04:31.271 --> 04:35.107
Good. Because I thought maybe he was
sick, but, apparently, he's not.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.777
Who wants to do up
the discharge papers?

04:40.322 --> 04:44.200
Unless we control the blood pressure,
he's gonna start circling the drain

04:44.326 --> 04:46.077
before we can figure out
what's wrong with him.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.454
Treat him for sepsis,
broad-spectrum antibiotics,

04:48.580 --> 04:50.581
and I want a Cort Stim test
and an echocardiogram.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.840
- You all right?
- Yeah.

05:00.425 --> 05:01.884
The Cort Stim test
will tell us

05:02.010 --> 05:04.762
if your pituitary and adrenal glands
are working properly.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.138
His glands?
What does that mean?

05:06.264 --> 05:08.224
We have a few theories
we're working on.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.559
- You mean you don't know.
- Mindy.

05:10.686 --> 05:13.771
If they knew, they wouldn't be
testing you, they'd be treating you.

05:13.897 --> 05:15.022
That's the way it works.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.442
First we find out what it is,
then we get you better.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.579
- You're half an hour late.
- Busy caseload.

05:30.706 --> 05:32.915
One case is not a load.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.583
So how are we doing
on cotton swabs today?

05:34.710 --> 05:36.502
If there's an acute shortage,
I could run home.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.754
No, you couldn't.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.798
Nice.

05:45.387 --> 05:48.389
Hello, sick people
and their loved ones.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.517
In the interest of saving time and
avoiding a lot of boring chitchat later,

05:51.643 --> 05:54.186
I'm Dr. Gregory House.
You can call me Greg.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.897
I'm one of three doctors
staffing this clinic this morning.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.357
Short. Sweet. Grab a file.

05:58.483 --> 06:01.235
This ray of sunshine
is Dr. Lisa Cuddy.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.862
Dr. Cuddy runs this whole hospital,

06:02.988 --> 06:05.197
so, unfortunately, she's much too busy
to deal with you.

06:05.323 --> 06:08.492
I am a board certified diagnostician,

06:08.618 --> 06:10.911
with a double specialty
of infectious disease and nephrology.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.247
I'm also the only doctor
currently employed at this clinic

06:13.373 --> 06:15.207
who is forced to be
here against his will.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.792
That is true, isn't it?

06:16.918 --> 06:18.753
But not to worry,
because for most of you,

06:18.879 --> 06:22.006
this job could be done
by a monkey with a bottle of Motrin.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.508
Speaking of which,
if you're particularly annoying,

06:24.634 --> 06:26.552
you may see me reach for this.

06:26.678 --> 06:29.764
This is Vicodin. It's mine.
You can't have any.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.974
And, no, I do not have
a pain-management problem.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.185
I have a pain problem.

06:34.561 --> 06:38.647
But who knows? Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe I'm too stoned to tell.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.192
So, who wants me?

06:44.279 --> 06:48.324
And who would rather wait
for one of the other two guys?

06:50.285 --> 06:54.413
Okay. Well, I'll be in Exam Room 1
if you change your mind.

06:55.373 --> 06:57.374
Jodi Matthews.

06:59.002 --> 07:02.379
Please accompany Dr. House
to Exam Room 1.

07:06.718 --> 07:08.886
Dr. Chase.

07:09.346 --> 07:12.598
I'm not sure scaring your boyfriend is
the best medicine for him right now.

07:12.724 --> 07:15.643
I know. I get stupid
when I'm scared.

07:15.769 --> 07:16.894
Don't go rock climbing.

07:17.020 --> 07:21.357
Look, I was wondering. Before
this happened, we were having sex.

07:22.859 --> 07:27.154
What? You're wondering if whatever
he has, you might have gotten it?

07:27.280 --> 07:29.740
It's unlikely. We ran
a complete STD panel, so...

07:29.866 --> 07:33.035
No. I'm wondering
if maybe I did this to him.

07:33.161 --> 07:35.538
I was kind of rough.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.921
It was yellow.

07:44.047 --> 07:47.091
- It was?
- It's not anymore.

07:47.217 --> 07:48.968
Well, that's a shame.

07:49.094 --> 07:53.806
I thought that might be
a problem, so I brought you this.

07:57.102 --> 08:00.771
Your mucus was 'pale goldenrod.'

08:00.897 --> 08:05.442
- Last week, yes. Should I be worried?
- Oh, yes. Very.

08:05.569 --> 08:07.945
Really? I thought it was okay now.

08:08.071 --> 08:10.823
And yet, here you are.
What happened?

08:10.949 --> 08:14.368
Paramedics took a week
to respond to your 911 call?

08:14.494 --> 08:16.370
You're not a very nice doctor,
are you?

08:16.496 --> 08:20.040
And you are very bad
at whatever it is you do.

08:20.167 --> 08:23.419
- You don't even know me.
- I know you're gonna get fired.

08:23.545 --> 08:25.171
That's why you got the new glasses.

08:25.297 --> 08:26.964
That's why your
teeth are sparkly white.

08:27.090 --> 08:31.594
You're getting the most of your health
insurance while you still can.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.637
I might be quitting.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.264
You'd have known that last week,

08:35.390 --> 08:37.099
when your snot was
still pale goldenrod.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.476
You're getting fired.

08:40.020 --> 08:43.480
I just don't like
being told what to do.

08:46.860 --> 08:50.738
I can get you in
for a full body scan later this week.

08:51.323 --> 08:53.199
Thanks.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.618
It's got to be viral.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.369
We should start
running gels and titers.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.788
Maybe we should look
into the girlfriend's theory.

08:59.915 --> 09:02.917
She thinks she rode him to death.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.335
What did you tell her?

09:04.461 --> 09:07.922
I told her 22-year-old men
don't die of sex.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.757
- What did you ask her?
- What do you mean?

09:09.883 --> 09:12.968
I mean, I hope you got some specifics
on exactly what was going on.

09:13.094 --> 09:17.181
If the girl thinks it could kill you,
it's worth knowing about.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.395
Have you ever taken a life?

09:31.947 --> 09:33.572
We should stop the antibiotics.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.908
It's too soon to say
they're not having an effect.

09:36.034 --> 09:38.619
They're having an effect.

09:38.745 --> 09:42.831
His BP's falling fast.
There's fluid filling his lungs.

09:42.958 --> 09:44.959
His creatinine is rising.

09:51.549 --> 09:54.510
His kidneys are shutting down.

09:54.803 --> 09:57.429
Our treatment
isn't making him better.

09:57.931 --> 09:58.973
It's killing him.

10:02.477 --> 10:05.938
So, we had six symptoms
that didn't add up to anything,

10:06.064 --> 10:07.731
now we got seven. Who's excited?

10:07.857 --> 10:09.233
I don't think it complicates things.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.402
The kidney failure was caused
by the antibiotics.

10:11.528 --> 10:14.196
- Maybe.
- Typically, low blood pressure

10:14.322 --> 10:16.615
and abdominal pain
means an infection.

10:16.741 --> 10:19.326
An abdominal infection causes
sepsis, low blood pressure.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.662
Except we checked
for abdominal infections.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.622
I know, but what
if it's the other way around?

10:23.748 --> 10:26.292
What if the low blood pressure's
causing the abdominal pain?

10:26.418 --> 10:29.044
Viral heart infection. The intestines
aren't getting enough blood,

10:29.170 --> 10:30.838
and the result is belly pain.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.382
I know it's
not the standard presentation.

10:33.508 --> 10:35.718
It's a 10-million-to-one shot.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.594
I thought
that's what we dealt with here.

10:37.721 --> 10:43.934
It explains the cardiomyopathy,
the pain, the low BP, the fever.

10:45.437 --> 10:49.356
You read the book. Impressive.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.818
It's a ludicrously long shot that
explains every one of those symptoms

10:53.028 --> 10:56.864
except for the cough and the rash.
Should we just erase those?

10:56.990 --> 10:59.366
Well, anything can cause a rash.

11:00.702 --> 11:03.912
Okay. Cardiac infection.

11:04.873 --> 11:07.541
Cameron, you thought allergy.

11:10.253 --> 11:11.754
Chase, what was it you thought?

11:11.880 --> 11:15.674
Carcinoid?
Then there's hypothyroidism.

11:15.800 --> 11:19.553
Could be parasites.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.350
Finally, sinus infection.

11:24.476 --> 11:28.604
If you're gonna list all it can't be,
you're gonna need more colors.

11:28.730 --> 11:33.442
Cameron was right. No condition
explains all these symptoms.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.779
But orange and green
covers everything.

11:36.905 --> 11:38.781
Orange and green?

11:39.240 --> 11:41.909
Two conditions
contracted simultaneously?

11:42.077 --> 11:45.329
Occam's razor. The simplest
explanation is always the best.

11:45.455 --> 11:49.750
- You think one is simpler than two?
- Pretty sure it is, yeah.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.461
Baby shows up.
Chase tells you

11:52.587 --> 11:55.297
that two people exchanged fluids
to create this being.

11:55.423 --> 11:58.634
I tell you that one stork dropped
the little tyke off in a diaper.

11:58.760 --> 12:01.178
- Are you gonna go with two or one?
- I think your argument is specious.

12:01.304 --> 12:04.515
I think your tie is ugly.
Why is one simpler than two?

12:04.808 --> 12:07.810
It's lower, lonelier. Is it simpler?

12:08.561 --> 12:10.979
Each one of these conditions
is about a thousand-to-one shot.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.815
That means that any
two of them happening

12:12.941 --> 12:14.566
at the same time is
a million-to-one shot.

12:14.692 --> 12:17.945
Chase says the cardiac infection
is a 10-million-to-one shot,

12:18.071 --> 12:21.198
which makes my idea
10 times better than yours.

12:21.324 --> 12:23.659
- Get a calculator. Run the numbers.
- We'll run the tests.

12:23.785 --> 12:26.036
Tests take time.
Treatment's quicker.

12:26.162 --> 12:30.457
Start the kid on Unasyn
for the sinus infection and...

12:31.209 --> 12:33.377
- What was orange?
- Hypothyroidism.

12:33.753 --> 12:37.005
- My uncle has hypothyroidism.
- Not like this.

12:37.132 --> 12:40.092
Intravenous levothyroxine
is an artificial thyroid medication

12:40.218 --> 12:41.427
that should take care of it.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.345
Also, the nurses are going
to start you on Unasyn.

12:43.471 --> 12:44.763
It's a more targeted antibiotic.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.515
- For the sinus infection?
- Yes.

12:46.641 --> 12:48.767
And the other stuff is
for something else entirely?

12:48.893 --> 12:51.520
Bad luck, huh? Don't worry.

12:51.646 --> 12:54.148
He should be back
to ditching work in no time.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.608
Brandon?

12:59.487 --> 13:00.863
Hey, Ma.

13:03.908 --> 13:07.119
We're his parents.
How's he doing?

13:07.328 --> 13:11.999
- Brandon is...
- Mom, Dad...

13:12.125 --> 13:13.917
this is Mindy.

13:14.043 --> 13:17.671
I was gonna bring her home
for Christmas.

13:18.548 --> 13:21.175
We're engaged.

13:29.601 --> 13:32.519
Dr. Hall
to the recovery room.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.438
Did you tell the family
House's theory?

13:34.564 --> 13:38.358
Two odd conditions striking completely
coincidentally at the exact same time.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.361
- I didn't phrase it quite that way.
- They agree to treatment?

13:41.488 --> 13:44.781
Of course they did. We're doctors.
They believe whatever we tell them.

13:44.908 --> 13:47.993
So, is that our job?
House's puppets?

13:48.119 --> 13:50.537
He comes up with an insane idea,
we get to pretend it's not?

13:50.663 --> 13:53.707
His insane ideas are usually right.
We've been here long enough to...

13:53.833 --> 13:56.376
We've been here long enough
to have Stockholm syndrome.

13:56.586 --> 13:58.420
What, because we don't hate him?

13:58.546 --> 14:01.131
He thinks outside the box.
Is that so evil?

14:01.257 --> 14:03.759
He has no idea where the box is.

14:03.885 --> 14:06.303
If you guys think he's right,
go home, relax.

14:06.429 --> 14:08.305
Just wait for the kid to get all better.

14:08.431 --> 14:12.601
I'm going to the lab
to test for viral infections.

14:22.320 --> 14:27.324
- Negative for Coxsackie B virus.
- Seven down, about 5,000 to go.

14:27.992 --> 14:30.035
You think we're gonna
come up with your mystery virus

14:30.161 --> 14:33.205
just by running gels
till we guess it right?

14:33.331 --> 14:35.457
No. I think we're gonna do it
by standing around

14:35.583 --> 14:37.918
watching other people work.

14:38.127 --> 14:41.296
I'm waiting
for the Epstein-Barr virus.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.719
- She's weird, isn't she?
- Bad idea.

14:47.845 --> 14:50.514
- What?
- Bad idea. You work with her.

14:50.890 --> 14:55.477
What did I say? Is weird some new,
ghetto euphemism for sexy,

14:55.603 --> 14:58.438
like bad is good
and phat is good?

14:58.565 --> 15:01.775
- Then what the hell does good mean?
- Ghetto euphemism?

15:02.485 --> 15:05.946
- You don't think she's hot?
- No.

15:07.115 --> 15:10.367
Then you're brilliant. And I am
using brilliant as a euphemism.

15:10.493 --> 15:13.870
Obviously, the girl is hot. You're not
talking about her aesthetics.

15:13.997 --> 15:17.332
You're talking about
if I want to jump her. I don't.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.584
Brilliant.

15:24.382 --> 15:26.842
Your Epstein-Barr is ready.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.432
- What are you doing?
- Level four.

15:33.558 --> 15:36.310
- No, no. I mean...
- I know what you meant.

15:36.519 --> 15:39.688
- We're waiting.
- My throat hurts.

15:39.897 --> 15:42.399
- So you said.
- How long are we waiting?

15:42.525 --> 15:46.653
Two minutes less than when
you asked me two minutes ago.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.197
Hi.

15:49.490 --> 15:53.035
Hi. I'm Dr. Cuddy.
Nice to meet you.

15:53.202 --> 15:55.287
Dr. Cuddy,
thanks for the consult.

15:55.413 --> 15:58.707
His throat seems
to have some condition.

16:00.501 --> 16:02.461
Say ah.

16:05.673 --> 16:08.550
He has a sore throat.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.637
Of course.
Yes, why didn't I...

16:11.763 --> 16:14.181
I mean, because
he said that it hurt.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.058
I should have deduced
that meant it was sore.

16:16.184 --> 16:18.226
- I was in a board meeting.
- Patients come first, right?

16:18.353 --> 16:21.063
Wouldn't want to prescribe a lozenge if
there's any doubt about its efficacy?

16:21.189 --> 16:23.607
You once asked me why
I think I'm always right,

16:23.733 --> 16:26.693
and I realized that you're right.
At least, I think you're right.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.488
I don't really know, now do I?

16:29.947 --> 16:34.284
- Hey. I'm here.
- Go home. Drink some hot tea.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.166
Excellent counsel.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.836
Negative on Parvovirus B19.

16:44.962 --> 16:48.006
- I'm impressed.
- Thank you. I was born to run gels.

16:48.132 --> 16:52.010
- I meant about Chase.
- What about Chase?

16:52.345 --> 16:54.971
Well, the man has
no physical interest in you.

16:55.098 --> 16:57.683
He has a completely
professional relationship with you,

16:57.809 --> 17:00.644
respects you as a colleague
and a doctor,

17:00.770 --> 17:04.564
and yet, he can't look
at you without thinking sex.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.525
Because I asked
what kind of sex could kill you?

17:06.651 --> 17:10.028
You now have total control
over your relationship with him.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.406
So, a woman can't express
her interest in sex

17:12.532 --> 17:15.575
without it being some
professional power play?

17:16.035 --> 17:18.245
If you look the way you do
and you say what you said,

17:18.371 --> 17:21.456
you have to be aware of the effect
that it's going to have on men.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.041
Men should grow up.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.793
And dogs should stop licking themselves.

17:24.919 --> 17:27.671
- It's not gonna happen.
- What's going on?

17:28.131 --> 17:30.424
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you guys.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.677
- Why didn't you page us?
- 'Cause I knew you'd be here.

17:33.803 --> 17:35.262
- Who told him?
- No one.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.265
I assume you're trying to prove
my crazy, two-illness theory wrong,

17:38.391 --> 17:40.976
so, obviously, you're gonna be
in the lab. You spin the urine?

17:41.102 --> 17:44.187
- Not yet.
- Talk to me when you have.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.197
- What'd you find out?
- Kidney failure.

17:54.323 --> 17:59.077
- It's acute interstitial nephritis.
- I wonder if that's significant.

17:59.203 --> 18:02.998
It means the antibiotics didn't
cause the kidney failure.

18:03.124 --> 18:05.667
- How'd you know?
- If you guys hadn't been so busy

18:05.793 --> 18:08.879
trying to prove me wrong, you might
have checked in on the poor kid.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.922
You visited a patient?

18:11.048 --> 18:14.342
I was sitting by his bed all morning,
so he'd know someone was there for him.

18:14.469 --> 18:17.554
- I looked in on him. He's much better.
- Ergo, the treatment's working.

18:17.680 --> 18:22.559
- Ergo, me right, you wrong.
- Hey, I'm glad for the kid.

18:24.896 --> 18:27.230
That smugness of yours
really is an attractive quality.

18:27.356 --> 18:30.984
Thank you. It was either that
or get my hair highlighted.

18:31.110 --> 18:34.237
- Smugness is easier to maintain.
- I get that you're not a big believer

18:34.363 --> 18:35.781
in the catching-flies-with-honey
approach,

18:35.907 --> 18:39.493
but do you honestly think you'll collect
a jarful by cleverly taunting them?

18:39.619 --> 18:42.287
Flies, no. Doctors, sure.
If I'd said to Foreman:

18:42.413 --> 18:44.664
"Nice try. It was a great guess,
but sorry, not this time,"

18:44.791 --> 18:45.791
what would he be doing now?

18:45.917 --> 18:48.752
I think he'd be going home
not feeling like a piece of crap.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.337
Exactly.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.464
You want him to feel
like a piece of crap?

18:52.590 --> 18:54.132
I don't want him going home.

18:57.762 --> 19:01.056
Dr. Foreman.

19:01.307 --> 19:04.309
- You still have the cough.
- I'm feeling a lot better though.

19:04.435 --> 19:07.646
His fever is gone.
His rash is going away.

19:07.772 --> 19:09.731
I see.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.900
Is everything okay?

19:12.026 --> 19:16.571
Just ordering some tests.
Absolutely nothing to worry about.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.588
How much longer?

19:33.714 --> 19:37.592
9:30. I figure she was
on the eighth hole when I paged her.

19:42.348 --> 19:45.058
You probably got another half hour.

19:49.188 --> 19:53.441
I ran a TSH, T3 and T4. The patient's
negative for hypothyroidism.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.235
I'm not talking about you.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.736
Well, the fact that he's getting better

19:56.904 --> 19:58.947
would indicate the unreliability
of the tests.

19:59.073 --> 20:01.992
If I'm right and it's a viral infection,
one of two things always happen,

20:02.118 --> 20:05.996
the patient dies or the patient's
immune system fights off the invader.

20:06.163 --> 20:07.914
What's with her?

20:08.165 --> 20:10.333
Her leg hurts after running six miles.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.627
- Who knows? Could be anything.
- He's getting better.

20:12.753 --> 20:16.172
That doesn't prove you're right.
That just proves he's getting better.

20:16.424 --> 20:19.676
It's not two illnesses.
It can't be two illnesses.

20:20.803 --> 20:23.388
I am so glad you work here.

20:23.973 --> 20:26.391
If I'm right,
the antibiotics you prescribed

20:26.517 --> 20:27.934
could box his kidneys and liver,

20:28.060 --> 20:30.812
impeding his ability to fight off
the virus. It could kill him.

20:30.938 --> 20:34.691
Well, that certainly
would be a concern.

20:35.318 --> 20:36.735
Fifty bucks?

20:37.612 --> 20:39.654
Don't look away. The space monkeys
will be all over you.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.824
- You wanna bet on the patient's health?
- You think that's bad luck?

20:42.950 --> 20:46.912
You think that God will smite him
because of our insensitivity?

20:47.038 --> 20:49.664
Well, if God does,
you make a quick 50.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.046
Go check his white-blood count.

20:56.255 --> 21:00.008
If he's fighting off a virus
like you think, it'll be way up.

21:04.847 --> 21:08.350
Cuddy said you needed a consult.
What's up? I'm busy.

21:25.910 --> 21:28.995
- I was just being glib.
- You haven't said anything.

21:29.330 --> 21:30.914
No.

21:31.165 --> 21:33.792
Before, when I was talking
about Brandon's girlfriend

21:33.918 --> 21:35.043
thinking sex could kill you.

21:35.169 --> 21:38.046
I was just making a joke
because I was uncomfortable.

21:38.172 --> 21:42.050
- I don't even remember what you said.
- I'm uncomfortable about sex.

21:42.385 --> 21:47.138
- We don't have to talk about this.
- Sex could kill you.

21:47.390 --> 21:49.849
Do you know what the human body
goes through when you have sex?

21:50.017 --> 21:52.477
Pupils dilate, arteries constrict,

21:52.603 --> 21:56.356
core temperature rises, heart races,
blood pressure skyrockets.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.900
Respiration
becomes rapid and shallow.

21:59.026 --> 22:02.195
The brain fires bursts of electrical
impulses from nowhere to nowhere,

22:02.321 --> 22:04.823
and secretions spit
out of every gland,

22:05.324 --> 22:06.908
and the muscles tense and spasm

22:07.034 --> 22:09.744
like you're lifting three times
your body weight.

22:09.912 --> 22:13.373
It's violent, it's ugly, and it's messy.

22:13.666 --> 22:16.459
And if God hadn't made it
unbelievably fun,

22:16.627 --> 22:19.129
the human race would've
died out eons ago.

22:22.383 --> 22:24.718
Men are lucky they can only
have one orgasm.

22:24.844 --> 22:28.513
You know that women
can have an hour-long orgasm?

22:29.515 --> 22:31.474
Hey, Foreman. What's up?

22:31.642 --> 22:33.476
- Hey, Foreman.
- Hey.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.604
White-cell count isn't up, is it?

22:36.731 --> 22:39.274
No. We were both wrong.

22:39.650 --> 22:42.819
White-cell count is down,
way down and dropping.

22:43.029 --> 22:46.573
His immune system is shot. We need
to get him into a clean room.

22:52.163 --> 22:55.206
Can you walk, Brandon?

22:55.332 --> 22:56.958
Yeah. A little.

22:57.084 --> 23:00.962
Okay. 'Cause we'll need
to leave the chair outside.

23:01.088 --> 23:04.507
- Thank you.
- Where's April? April?

23:04.925 --> 23:08.762
- Can you take that chairr? Thank you.
- Yes, Robert.

23:09.555 --> 23:12.724
I'll need to take your mask
and your robe, too.

23:20.066 --> 23:24.235
You might wanna block
your ears for this, it's quite loud.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.998
Something's made him
immunocompromised.

23:37.124 --> 23:38.958
His white-blood-cell count is down,

23:39.085 --> 23:41.753
which means his body
can't fight off infections.

23:41.879 --> 23:45.924
- If he gets sick, he'll die.
- Sick? How sick?

23:46.133 --> 23:48.802
If he gets a cold, he'll die.

24:00.106 --> 24:04.192
Okay. I'm gonna push
the needle into your hip bone

24:04.318 --> 24:06.528
and take some of the marrow.

24:08.072 --> 24:11.157
- That's not so bad.
- Uh-uh.

24:11.909 --> 24:14.119
That was just the anesthetic.

24:14.703 --> 24:18.206
The core biopsy needle,
it's a bit bigger.

24:19.291 --> 24:24.379
Hey, man. Take a deep breath.
This is gonna hurt, a lot.

24:30.886 --> 24:33.638
Your marrow makes
the blood cells.

24:35.099 --> 24:37.976
We take a peek at it
under a microscope,

24:38.102 --> 24:41.479
and maybe we find
a viral infection.

24:41.605 --> 24:43.940
Maybe we find some fibrosis.

24:44.066 --> 24:48.611
Something to explain
why your blood count is so low.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.364
There we go.

24:52.366 --> 24:54.284
One step closer to an answer.

24:56.162 --> 24:58.496
If you don't find one,

25:00.124 --> 25:02.667
I can't stay here forever.

25:10.384 --> 25:14.304
- The patient could've died.
- The one with the pulled muscle?

25:14.430 --> 25:18.099
Those symptoms are consistent
with a dozen other conditions.

25:18.225 --> 25:19.976
You know, I'm entitled to a consult.

25:20.102 --> 25:21.686
You are not getting
out of clinic duty.

25:21.812 --> 25:25.148
Come on. You got a hundred other
idiot doctors in this building

25:25.274 --> 25:28.568
who go all warm and fuzzy every
time they pull a toy car out of a nose.

25:28.694 --> 25:30.570
- You don't need me here.
- No, I don't,

25:30.696 --> 25:33.031
but working with people actually
makes you a better doctor.

25:33.157 --> 25:34.574
When did I sign up
for that course?

25:34.700 --> 25:37.327
When did I give you
the impression that I care?

25:37.453 --> 25:41.289
Working in this clinic obviously
instills a deep sense of compassion.

25:41.415 --> 25:42.957
I've got your home number, right?

25:43.083 --> 25:45.585
In case anything comes up
at 3:00 in the morning.

25:45.711 --> 25:48.463
It's not gonna work.
You know why?

25:48.589 --> 25:50.673
Because this is fun.

25:50.799 --> 25:52.926
You think of something
to make me miserable.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.802
I think of something
to make you miserable.

25:54.929 --> 25:57.722
It's a game, and I'm gonna win
because I got a head start.

25:57.848 --> 26:00.225
You are already miserable.

26:04.230 --> 26:05.772
- Is this important?
- No.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.523
Good.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.486
- What's with you and her?
- Don't.

26:11.612 --> 26:13.446
You have a thing for her?
The only people who can...

26:13.572 --> 26:15.823
No. There is not a thin line
between love and hate.

26:15.950 --> 26:17.617
There is, in fact,
a Great Wall of China,

26:17.743 --> 26:21.079
with armed sentries posted
every 20 feet between love and hate.

26:21.205 --> 26:23.498
- Thirty-six Vicodin.
- Who's the patient?

26:23.624 --> 26:25.166
- I am.
- You can't...

26:25.292 --> 26:28.127
Dr. Wilson
is the prescribing physician.

26:28.254 --> 26:30.546
You will lie, cheat
and steal to get what you want,

26:30.673 --> 26:32.382
but you're incapable
of kissing a little ass?

26:32.508 --> 26:37.220
- Come on. We all have our limitations.
- House, wrong bottle.

26:37.513 --> 26:38.554
Do me a favor.

26:38.681 --> 26:41.224
Take one of these,
wait five minutes for it to kick in,

26:41.350 --> 26:43.977
then find Cuddy
and kiss her ass.

26:45.187 --> 26:48.231
What was the kid's first symptom?

26:48.440 --> 26:52.235
You did the history. Of his
800 symptoms, which one hit him first?

26:52.361 --> 26:53.653
The cough.

28:20.616 --> 28:22.367
Gout.

28:28.499 --> 28:30.291
Are we talking
about Brandon?

28:30.417 --> 28:32.919
Gout? Uric acid crystals in the joints?

28:33.295 --> 28:37.173
The symptoms are pain,
swelling, redness, stiffness.

28:37.299 --> 28:39.050
Not one of which do
I see on that board.

28:39.176 --> 28:42.261
Because he doesn't have gout.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.932
Every day, cells die.

28:49.103 --> 28:53.439
We survive because the remaining cells
divide and replace the losses.

28:53.982 --> 28:57.026
The colchicine, a gout medicine,

28:57.319 --> 29:00.279
blocks mitosis and
stops cell division,

29:00.572 --> 29:04.117
which will result
in abdominal pain, rash,

29:04.326 --> 29:08.579
nausea, fever, kidney failure,
low blood pressure

29:08.705 --> 29:10.540
and will also mess
with the bone marrow.

29:10.666 --> 29:13.000
He doesn't have gout.
Why would he have gout medication?

29:13.127 --> 29:14.460
Because you guys were right.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.879
He didn't have two conditions
at the exact same time.

29:17.005 --> 29:20.258
First, he got a cough. And because
he's an idiot, he went to a doctor.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.635
In order to justify charging $200,

29:22.761 --> 29:25.430
that doctor felt he should
actually do something. Oops!

29:25.556 --> 29:26.931
He wrote a prescription.

29:27.057 --> 29:30.977
Seven thousand people die
each year from pharmacy screw-ups.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.062
Not nearly as many as die
from doctor screw-ups,

29:33.188 --> 29:36.065
but still, not something they use
in their promotional materials.

29:36.191 --> 29:39.318
The pharmacist gave him gout medicine
instead of cough medicine,

29:39.445 --> 29:41.571
and the only thing it wouldn't do,

29:41.697 --> 29:45.533
it would do absolutely nothing
to relieve his cough.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.618
Occam's razor.

29:47.995 --> 29:51.247
The simplest explanation is almost
always that somebody screwed up.

29:51.373 --> 29:55.460
But once he checked into this hospital,
he was completely in our control.

29:55.586 --> 29:57.962
Our food, our pills, our everything,

29:58.088 --> 30:00.339
so even if you're right,
no more gout medication.

30:00.466 --> 30:03.759
He'd either continue to deteriorate,
or he would've gotten better.

30:03.886 --> 30:06.387
But he got better,
and then he got worse.

30:06.513 --> 30:09.056
It doesn't fit. It doesn't make sense.

30:09.224 --> 30:12.185
Okay. Two people screwed up.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.687
Not as simple as one, but...

30:24.323 --> 30:25.865
He's resting. He's...

30:25.991 --> 30:28.409
I'm Dr. House.
I'm your son's physician.

30:28.535 --> 30:33.164
- You're the one we haven't met yet.
- You're the one he hasn't met.

30:33.290 --> 30:35.416
How can you treat someone
without meeting them?

30:35.542 --> 30:38.669
It's easy if you don't
give a crap about him.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.297
That's a good thing.

30:41.423 --> 30:45.343
If emotions made you act rationally,
they wouldn't be called emotions, right?

30:45.469 --> 30:47.136
That's why we have
this division of labor.

30:47.262 --> 30:49.597
You hold his hand,
I get him better.

30:49.723 --> 30:52.308
If I start tucking him in at night,
that's not fair to you guys.

30:52.434 --> 30:54.852
If you start prescribing medicine,
that's not fair to me.

30:55.103 --> 30:58.898
What I wanna know is,
who stepped on my side of the net?

30:59.024 --> 31:03.945
Who cared enough to get stupid enough
to give him his cough medicine?

31:04.071 --> 31:07.657
- When we checked in, Dr. Foreman...
- Tuesday, he's getting better.

31:07.783 --> 31:09.909
Wednesday, he's getting sick again.

31:10.035 --> 31:13.246
Somebody gave him
his cough medicine Wednesday.

31:17.584 --> 31:20.753
Come on. Nobody's gonna be mad.

31:20.963 --> 31:24.215
I just wanna know
who tried to kill the kid.

31:28.762 --> 31:32.348
- Dr. House, maybe we should...
- His throat was sore.

31:35.269 --> 31:37.770
Page Dr. Occam.
He's gonna wanna hear about this.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.982
I'm sorry. He was coughing,
and I just wanted to help him.

31:41.108 --> 31:43.317
Aren't you a dear.
Where are the pills?

31:43.443 --> 31:46.529
He took the last of them before
he was switched into that room.

31:46.655 --> 31:48.781
- They're all gone?
- It was just cough medicine.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.534
No, it wasn't.
Where's the bottle?

31:59.835 --> 32:02.044
We need to know exactly
what you put in this bottle.

32:02.170 --> 32:04.088
We think it was colchicine,
a gout medication.

32:04.214 --> 32:07.216
If the prescription said cough medicine,
that's what I dispensed.

32:07.342 --> 32:09.719
The family is prepared
to waive liability, all right?

32:09.845 --> 32:12.096
We just need to know
what it was, what dosage it was.

32:12.222 --> 32:13.973
It was cough medicine.

32:14.474 --> 32:16.100
Refill it.

32:18.562 --> 32:22.815
- He's gonna be okay.
- You don't know that.

32:24.484 --> 32:27.653
Does Brandon like
that quality in you?

32:28.405 --> 32:30.823
You're a little negative.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.784
Things don't always
work out for the best.

32:33.910 --> 32:35.411
Doesn't hurt to hope they do.

32:35.537 --> 32:39.040
No. Not unless that makes you
figure you can do whatever you want,

32:39.166 --> 32:42.168
like give people cough medicine.

32:42.419 --> 32:44.253
This is cough medication.

32:44.379 --> 32:47.840
This is what Brandon
was supposed to get.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.384
They're small, round and yellow.

32:50.510 --> 32:53.179
Can you tell this man what the pills
in your son's medicine bottle

32:53.305 --> 32:55.222
actually looked like?

32:56.475 --> 32:59.226
They were small, round
and yellow, exactly like this.

32:59.353 --> 33:01.270
Those were the pills
that Brandon was taking.

33:01.396 --> 33:03.189
Hey, I'm just a pharmacist,

33:03.315 --> 33:06.442
but I know what cough medicine
looks like, Doctor.

33:10.864 --> 33:14.033
It was so perfect.
It was beautiful.

33:14.326 --> 33:17.703
Beauty often seduces us
on the road to truth.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.707
And triteness kicks
us in the nads.

33:21.917 --> 33:24.794
- So true.
- This doesn't bother you?

33:25.170 --> 33:28.089
That you were wrong?
I try to work through the pain.

33:28.215 --> 33:31.092
I was not wrong.
Everything I said was true.

33:31.426 --> 33:35.096
- It fit. It was elegant.
- So, reality was wrong?

33:36.890 --> 33:39.433
Reality's almost always wrong.

33:45.232 --> 33:47.775
The cough medicine did something.

33:49.486 --> 33:51.862
Aggravated the condition.

33:52.072 --> 33:54.156
It's all over the place.
Must be in his blood.

33:54.324 --> 33:56.242
What if it is his blood?

33:56.451 --> 33:58.661
- Lymphoma?
- Unless you've got something better.

33:58.787 --> 34:00.496
We foolishly ruled out lymphoma

34:00.622 --> 34:02.832
because his CT scan
showed no adenopathy.

34:02.958 --> 34:05.793
CBC showed a normal differen-smear,
bone marrow showed no...

34:05.919 --> 34:07.169
Screw the tests.

34:07.337 --> 34:11.173
Do an exploratory laparotomy
and find out what's in there.

34:11.591 --> 34:14.385
He has no blood pressure,
no immune system and no kidneys.

34:14.511 --> 34:17.221
- Surgery will kill him.
- Yeah, you're right.

34:17.431 --> 34:19.640
Let's stick with the wrong-pill theory.

34:24.104 --> 34:26.522
I'll schedule him for surgery.

34:31.111 --> 34:34.238
Okay, Brandon, we're
running this tube through your heart

34:34.406 --> 34:36.907
and into the pulmonary arteries
in your lung.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.826
The sensors
will give us information

34:38.952 --> 34:40.995
for the exploratory surgery
later this afternoon.

34:45.375 --> 34:48.335
- My fingers are numb.
- Try not to move.

34:49.129 --> 34:50.838
We're in the right atrium,

34:51.047 --> 34:53.466
trying to catch the flow
through the tricuspid valve.

34:53.592 --> 34:56.927
I think the
catheter's curling in the atrium.

34:57.053 --> 35:00.181
Got it. We're in the RV now.

35:02.976 --> 35:05.644
Ectopy. You must've
irritated the heart wall.

35:05.771 --> 35:08.564
- It'll calm down.
- He can't tolerate cardiac arrhythmia.

35:08.690 --> 35:11.192
- Pull back.
- He needs the surgery.

35:23.163 --> 35:25.372
Pressure's dropped.

35:25.499 --> 35:27.958
- You still with us, Brandon?
- Get the curtains.

35:28.502 --> 35:29.960
VF.

35:39.930 --> 35:42.848
Charging. Clear.

35:48.897 --> 35:50.731
Sinus rhythm.

35:52.108 --> 35:53.567
I got a pulse.

35:56.488 --> 35:58.989
Yeah, but no surgery today.

36:05.539 --> 36:06.539
How're you doing?

36:06.998 --> 36:08.374
Okay.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.460
Great. I'm doing good, too.

36:11.711 --> 36:15.130
I get to knock off
an hour early today. You know why?

36:15.257 --> 36:18.259
Because I kissed my boss' ass.
Do you ever do that?

36:18.385 --> 36:21.303
I think she just said yes 'cause
she wants to reinforce that behavior.

36:21.471 --> 36:25.558
Wants me to kiss a lot of other people's
ass, like she wants me to kiss yours.

36:25.684 --> 36:29.603
What would you want, a doctor
who holds your hand while you die

36:29.729 --> 36:31.897
or a doctor who ignores you
while you get better?

36:32.107 --> 36:34.316
I guess it would particularly suck
to have a doctor

36:34.442 --> 36:36.652
who ignores you while you die.

36:37.696 --> 36:38.654
I should go.

36:38.780 --> 36:41.115
You think it's gonna
come out on its own?

36:45.495 --> 36:48.539
Are we talking bigger
than a breadbasket?

36:49.499 --> 36:54.044
Actually, it will come out on its own.
Which, for small stuff, is no problem.

36:54.170 --> 36:56.505
It's wrapped up in a nice,
soft package, and plop.

36:56.631 --> 36:58.883
Big stuff,
you're gonna rip something,

36:59.009 --> 37:00.885
which, speaking medically,
is when the fun stops.

37:01.011 --> 37:02.761
How did you...

37:02.888 --> 37:06.265
After half an hour you haven't sat down.
That tells me its location.

37:06.391 --> 37:08.726
You haven't told me what it is.
That tells me it's humiliating.

37:08.852 --> 37:10.477
You have a little birdie
carved on your arm.

37:10.604 --> 37:12.813
That tells me you have
a high tolerance for humiliation,

37:12.939 --> 37:15.399
so I figure it's not hemorrhoids.

37:19.321 --> 37:22.781
I've been a doctor 20 years.
You're not gonna surprise me.

37:23.867 --> 37:26.285
It's an MP3 player.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.129
Is it...

37:37.756 --> 37:41.258
Is it because
of the size or the shape,

37:41.843 --> 37:44.637
or is it the pounding bass line?

37:45.263 --> 37:47.264
What are we gonna do?

37:49.851 --> 37:52.102
- I'm gonna wait.
- For what?

37:54.481 --> 37:58.150
It's 3:00. I'm off. Would you tell
Dr. Cuddy there's a patient

37:58.276 --> 38:00.027
in Exam Room 2 needs her attention?

38:00.153 --> 38:04.114
And the RIAA wants her
to check for illegal downloads.

38:04.407 --> 38:08.077
Brandon's not ready for surgery.
- Let's leave it a couple of weeks.

38:08.203 --> 38:11.205
He should be feeling better by then.
Wait. Which way does time go?

38:11.331 --> 38:14.541
He crashed during prep. He's also
experiencing pain in his fingers.

38:14.668 --> 38:16.418
Think some bug may have gotten
in the clean room.

38:16.544 --> 38:18.587
I think we should
double his dosage of G-CSF

38:18.713 --> 38:21.590
to temporarily boost
his white-blood-cell count.

38:21.758 --> 38:24.510
Pain in his fingers. Right.

38:33.353 --> 38:34.937
Hi again.

38:35.063 --> 38:37.356
- You can't go in...
- Where's he going?

38:39.901 --> 38:41.902
Hey. How you all doing?

38:42.153 --> 38:45.280
Interesting fact. Every seven years,
it's a whole new you.

38:45.532 --> 38:48.617
- Inspiring metaphor, huh?
- Dr. House, this is a clean room.

38:48.743 --> 38:50.369
Yeah. I read the sign.

38:51.121 --> 38:54.832
But cells of different organs
reproduce at different rates.

38:56.001 --> 38:58.711
So, you get a new kidney
every three years.

38:58.962 --> 39:00.754
Get a new stomach lining
every week.

39:00.880 --> 39:04.967
This is why colchicine poisoning causes
all these symptoms, but not all at once.

39:05.093 --> 39:07.886
But we went to the pharmacy.
We saw the pills.

39:08.013 --> 39:11.015
Colchicine does its damage
in a very specific order.

39:11.141 --> 39:14.226
First of all, there's the pain
in the abdomen, the rash, the fever.

39:14.436 --> 39:17.521
Isn't that what you got first?
Then the kidneys go,

39:17.647 --> 39:20.524
which is exactly what happened to...

39:20.650 --> 39:22.735
- Brandon.
- Right.

39:23.069 --> 39:26.780
Then it screws up
your bone marrow and then neuropathy.

39:26.906 --> 39:29.908
A painful tingling
in the fingers and toes.

39:30.035 --> 39:32.578
And what do you suppose
happens after that?

39:37.751 --> 39:43.964
Hair loss. The bad news is
your special boy is doing drugs.

39:44.090 --> 39:45.799
- No, he's not.
- Ecstasy?

39:45.925 --> 39:47.092
No.

39:48.094 --> 39:49.511
Twice with Dan and Mike.

39:50.096 --> 39:53.557
You know what they cut that stuff
with? Apparently, colchicine.

39:53.683 --> 39:56.769
Unless you ingested the colchicine
through your contact lens solution

39:56.895 --> 39:59.813
or skin cream or some other drug
you're lying about.

39:59.939 --> 40:02.566
I don't know how it happened. I don't
care how it happened. It happened.

40:02.692 --> 40:04.276
Start...

40:05.528 --> 40:07.446
- Brandon.
- Lovely name.

40:07.572 --> 40:09.740
Start Brandon on Fab fragments,

40:09.866 --> 40:12.284
and get him some Tylenol
for the hair I pulled out.

40:12.494 --> 40:14.536
And get some air in here.

40:16.539 --> 40:18.832
Make a note.
I should never doubt myself.

40:18.958 --> 40:20.542
I think you'll remember.

40:20.668 --> 40:23.128
It wouldn't hurt you
to be wrong every now and then.

40:23.254 --> 40:25.130
What, you don't care
about these people?

40:29.552 --> 40:33.555
The colchicine interferes with the
ability of the heart muscle to contract,

40:33.681 --> 40:37.059
pumping blood,
lowering your blood pressure.

40:38.895 --> 40:43.190
The antibodies we're giving you
should neutralize the colchicine,

40:45.026 --> 40:48.445
allowing your heart
to beat at its normal rate.

40:49.489 --> 40:51.532
When will you know?

40:52.367 --> 40:54.159
We know now.

40:55.620 --> 40:58.539
Oh, thank God.

41:20.812 --> 41:22.729
Big weekend?

41:22.856 --> 41:26.525
- It's not for me. I'm fully stocked.
- Cuddy got you doing inventory?

41:26.818 --> 41:30.195
- Trying to solve that kid's case.
- The gout medicine OD?

41:30.321 --> 41:31.530
Yeah.

41:31.656 --> 41:33.240
The fact that I know
it's a gout medicine OD

41:33.366 --> 41:35.159
would seem to indicate the case
is already solved.

41:35.285 --> 41:37.035
Well, you'd be wrong.

41:37.162 --> 41:39.246
What about the fact
that the kid is now,

41:39.372 --> 41:41.790
I believe the technical
term is not sick?

41:41.916 --> 41:44.751
You know how many forms of colchicine
there are on the market?

41:45.086 --> 41:50.090
Neither do I, but it's a lot.
Pills, powders, liquids, IV fluids.

41:50.216 --> 41:52.551
Somewhere at a party, in his coffee,

41:52.677 --> 41:54.303
up his nose, in his ear,
this kid had some.

41:54.429 --> 41:56.763
So, you're not happy
with your Ecstasy theory?

41:56.890 --> 41:58.807
- He said he used it twice.
- People lie.

41:58.933 --> 42:01.059
- If you're gonna lie, it's...
- I'm not interested.

42:01.186 --> 42:04.980
- Not curious?
- No. Because I'm well adjusted.

42:06.191 --> 42:07.441
Right.

42:10.069 --> 42:13.113
- Temperature's normal.
- I want cousin Sharon there.

42:13.239 --> 42:16.116
If we invite Sharon, we have to invite
all the cousins.

42:16.242 --> 42:19.036
So what? My side of the family
doesn't need anything.

42:23.750 --> 42:25.959
I don't suppose I could have
some of those cough pills?

42:26.085 --> 42:28.253
- They're okay, right?
- Yes. You're doing great.

42:28.379 --> 42:30.005
You should invite Dr. House.

42:30.131 --> 42:32.382
- Will he come?
- No, but he'll send a gift.

42:32.508 --> 42:35.802
I'll make sure it's a good one.

42:35.970 --> 42:38.555
There's a letter
on the back of these pills.

42:40.600 --> 42:42.851
Your old pills
didn't have a letter on them?

42:42.977 --> 42:45.854
No. Round and yellow,
but no letter.

42:52.612 --> 42:55.239
Well, these will help your cough.

42:59.702 --> 43:02.204
- Hey, you wanna go get some...
- No.
