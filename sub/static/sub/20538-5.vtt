Could somebody shut off those rats?

02:35.030 --> 02:39.524
Oh, no, no, they're not rats.
They're meerkats and they are so cute!

- Uh... it is 6:47.

You listen to their assessment

05:26.493 --> 05:28.279
Pidge said I needed some drama on my face.

05:28.370 --> 05:31.954
It was this or mascara, and I don't like
shit around my eyes 'cause I got allergies

05:32.040 --> 05:34.532

one of them girls who cry.

- Oh, it's good. Yeah, cute.
- Yeah, mmm-hmm.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.414
Uh, I'm totally liking it.

05:39.172 --> 05:42.415
You should try doing the prune lips
like an Olsen twin does.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.670
[Flaca] Mmm.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.092

05:51.893 --> 05:55.636
Well, if you don't like my face,
maybe you'll like this! [chuckling]

05:55.730 --> 05:58.893
[Maritza] Oh, my God!
Shit.

05:58.984 --> 06:02.818

children or naked buttholes.

[chuckfing]
Why are you walking like you're 90?

06:09.119 --> 06:12.783
[Piper] Because we slept in
a digger bucket, and I can't feel my neck.

06:12.873 --> 06:17.117
I once dated a girl named Digger.
Her parents ran a cemetery.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.826
She stole me a ring off a corpse.

06:18.920 --> 06:22.663
How romantic.
Illegal and creepy, but very romantic.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.623
She left me
for a professional water-skier.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.460
She said she was the only woman
who ever looked hot in a life vest.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.589
How do you fight that?

06:28.680 --> 06:31.342
I think we need more padding.
Like a base layer.

06:31.433 --> 06:34.767
You know, like a...
like a tarp or something.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.514
Whoa. I didn't even ask you
to move in, Pipes.

06:36.605 --> 06:38.892
That's, uh... that's pretty presumptuous.

06:38.982 --> 06:42.771
Alex Vause,
may I put my prison-issue mattress

06:42.861 --> 06:48.573
next to your bulldozer scoopie thingy,
and ride out a nightmare with you?

06:48.658 --> 06:49.819
You may.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.739
Will I not like you
when you get very angry?

06:56.833 --> 06:57.823
[Alex] I'm repurposing.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.500
Huh.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.713
Do you want me to help you
rip off the other one?

07:04.799 --> 07:06.836
Is it driving you crazy?

07:06.927 --> 07:08.042
No.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.587
Yes.
You know that I need symmetry!

07:11.681 --> 07:14.343
- It's hard to look at, huh?
- Now you're just being a bully.

07:15.101 --> 07:19.516
Okay, fine.
This is a gift for you.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.438
It's no corpse ring, but it'll have to do.

07:25.612 --> 07:29.822
Daya!
Hey, I've been looking for you.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.490
You found something to eat okay?

07:31.576 --> 07:33.362
Why, you wanna jack me for my Pop-Tart?

07:33.453 --> 07:36.161
Hey. I know you don't understand
what I did or why I did it, but--

07:36.247 --> 07:37.658
You're right.
I don't understand.

07:37.749 --> 07:40.161
This whole fucking time
you didn't say nothing.

07:40.251 --> 07:42.913
And you fucking hit me in my head.
I could have a football injury.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.541
- I got a wicked headache.
- You shot a guard.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.794
You weren't acting
like a responsible gun owner.

07:47.884 --> 07:49.466
I don't care.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.042
- I don't care if he dies.
- And I do?

07:51.137 --> 07:52.969
We all think about
taking down these cabrones,

07:53.056 --> 07:56.299
but we don't act on it
'cause we got things to live for.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.509
You gotta get outta here
and see your girl.

07:58.603 --> 07:59.638
[Dayanara huffs]

07:59.729 --> 08:02.437
[mimics Dayanara] Look at me. Hey.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.396
You need to take a timeout, okay?

08:07.487 --> 08:10.070
Why don't you help me clean up?
We could do it together.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.488
Busy hands could help
clear your head, huh?

08:13.535 --> 08:15.947
My head hurts, all right?

08:16.037 --> 08:18.404
I want nothing to do with you.

08:19.416 --> 08:20.872
Maybe your shadow
can help you play cleanup.

08:21.668 --> 08:24.126
- My what?
- Good morning.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.202
What's for breakfast?

08:28.008 --> 08:29.339
You're looking at it.

08:29.426 --> 08:32.214
Um, no. I'm not.

08:32.303 --> 08:36.011
Breakfast is supposed to be served
between 4:30 and 7:00.

08:36.099 --> 08:39.091
Today's offerings should include
a hot grits,

08:39.184 --> 08:42.678
a whole wheat bread or coffee cake,
a margarine pat and skim milk.

08:42.772 --> 08:46.356
- Sometimes there's a surprise, like--
- Okay, yeah. Breakfast is canceled.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.901
Breakfast is canceled...

08:56.119 --> 08:57.109
Fine.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.580
Breakfast, okay?

09:09.674 --> 09:12.883
Oh! Thank you! [chuckles]

09:12.969 --> 09:14.551
This is the surprise, for sure.

09:14.637 --> 09:18.301
Um, by any chance,
will there be a spoon made available?

09:19.809 --> 09:21.140
[sighs]

09:23.605 --> 09:26.848
Yeah, I'll get one.
Sit down.

09:41.706 --> 09:42.741
[grunts]

09:44.042 --> 09:45.123
Oh, what the hell.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.252
Okay. Pick a color.
You want gel?

09:53.343 --> 09:55.209
Uh, no. Um...

09:56.513 --> 09:58.800
- I want to apply for a job here.
-[woman] Hmm?

09:58.890 --> 10:02.053

- It's meter parking, yeah.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.929
No. [chuckles]

10:04.020 --> 10:07.388
I want to work here.
Do nails.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.315
I do manicures.
I did these.

10:11.361 --> 10:12.726
Oh.

10:14.030 --> 10:17.898
Exacfly.
I'm a fuckin' artist with this shit.

10:17.992 --> 10:20.825
I did my toes, too.
See that?

10:20.912 --> 10:24.121
Cheetah.
You know... [roars]

10:24.207 --> 10:25.447
Yes. Good.

10:25.542 --> 10:28.910
- Great. So how much you paying me?
- Twenty dollars a day.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.960
What? Uh-uh.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.663
- That's way too low.
- No, no, no.

10:32.757 --> 10:35.340
You pay me to train.

10:35.426 --> 10:36.882
- To train?
- Mmm-hmm.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.381
In what?

10:38.471 --> 10:40.303
I'd buff circles
around these sashimi bitches.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.095
Two weeks train, or you go now.

10:45.603 --> 10:49.096
You know what, you can shit up a rope
with your $20 a day.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.646
And it's your loss.

10:50.733 --> 10:53.191
I would have had this place packed,
with lines out the door.

10:53.278 --> 10:55.019
Charging people to work?

10:55.113 --> 10:58.777
This is America, lady.
Slavery ain't legal here!

11:06.958 --> 11:09.871
Mei... are you in here against your will?

11:14.048 --> 11:16.540
[Sankey] Come on, slave!
We're hangry!

11:16.634 --> 11:20.127
How long does it take to fry,
poach and scramble some damn eggs?

11:20.221 --> 11:23.805
Ladies, I am moving as fast as I can.
You know, all I have is powdered eggs.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.724
Did we say you could talk?

11:25.810 --> 11:27.721
Yeah, just make it rain, King.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.223
What the fuck did y'all do?

11:29.314 --> 11:31.931
Did y'all see the news?
They think y'all terrorists!

11:32.025 --> 11:33.311
We know. We saw.

11:33.401 --> 11:34.812
And they had no right
to call us bin Ladens

11:34.903 --> 11:36.610
without checking who we were
under those Ewok hats.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.778
- The whole thing's totally offensive.
- Fuckin' media.

11:38.865 --> 11:42.483
What's offensive is that a photograph
of two idiots wearing hijabs

11:42.577 --> 11:44.443
automatically gets labelled as terrorism.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.448
[Black Cindy] Hey, do I smell eggs?

11:46.539 --> 11:49.406
Ooh! Let me get one of them over easy, JK!

11:49.500 --> 11:51.958
No way, she's our slave.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.503
And over easy's nasty.
All that egg slime.

11:54.589 --> 11:56.250
Bitch, egg snot the best part.

11:56.341 --> 11:58.332
-[scoffs] Splooge-y.
-[Black Cindy] Y'all crazy.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.337
Over easy's the only way to cook an egg.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.044
Ain't that right, Jude?

12:02.138 --> 12:04.675
Over medium is considered
the gold standard.

12:04.766 --> 12:07.007
-[laughing]
- In your face!

12:07.101 --> 12:10.639
Shocking. The white lady backs up
the other whites about egg whites.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.893
Look, we need to borrow
D-list Martha Stewart for a while.

12:13.983 --> 12:16.896
We need to show the media that
she ain't locked up in a closet

12:16.986 --> 12:19.648
with a bag over her head
and jumper cables on her nips.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.026
-[all] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- What the fuck?

12:22.116 --> 12:24.653
She's our property
and we're not in the lending business.

12:24.744 --> 12:25.734
That's Jews.

12:25.828 --> 12:29.537
Yeah, maybe you didn't hear her.
We taking the bitch, so excuse us.

12:29.624 --> 12:32.457
Oh, so this is communism now?
We give you whatever for free?

12:32.543 --> 12:35.752
No, our whole lives is
you people takin' from us for free.

12:35.838 --> 12:39.752
If you want her,
you gotta buy her, like an American.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.173
That's the deal.

12:44.472 --> 12:45.962
[sighs]

12:48.726 --> 12:49.966
What do you want for her?

12:50.687 --> 12:51.893
What VOu got?

12:51.980 --> 12:55.393
Aw, shit!
You seeing this?

12:55.483 --> 12:57.645
[young <i>Janae] Yes.
And I disagree.</i>

12:57.735 --> 13:01.649
I think Bods giving tree actually does
more takin' away than giving.

13:01.739 --> 13:04.356
- How so?
- The tree's a sign of goodness.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.736
But when it gets filled with cement,

13:05.827 --> 13:09.240
the tree symbolizes what's been taken
from Scout, her innocence.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.197
- Plus, she's got that dumb name.
-[students laugh]

13:12.292 --> 13:13.453
[school bell rings]

13:13.543 --> 13:15.375
Okay, permission slips, people!

13:15.461 --> 13:18.328
I need them
before we get on the bus tomorrow.

13:18.423 --> 13:20.539
Uh, Janae, I'd like to speak with you.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.840
Ooh. Watson getting called out.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.167
Yeah, right.
For what?

13:27.807 --> 13:30.094
- Here, I got my permission slip.
- Ah, excellent.

13:30.184 --> 13:33.017
I want to make sure
you're coming tomorrow. You excited?

13:33.104 --> 13:34.686
- Yeah. I guess.
- I'm excited for you.

13:35.398 --> 13:38.015
Doors are gonna open
if you keep working hard, Janae.

13:38.109 --> 13:39.816
I want you to see
what's behind some of those doors.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.735
Okay. Great.
See you tomorrow.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.775
Okay. So after flossing my teeth,

13:48.870 --> 13:51.532
and doing that under-eye cream
we talked about,

13:51.622 --> 13:55.115
I go to here, Spanish Harlem.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.041
I know it looks messy and everything,

13:57.128 --> 13:59.540
but it's because we have
that protest and everything.

13:59.630 --> 14:05.171
My bunk is over there, and right here,
we have Pidge and Ouija.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.548
Or Peejee.
Say hi, you guys!

14:07.638 --> 14:10.881
- No one calls us that.
- I didn't sign a release.

14:13.102 --> 14:16.345
Okay, so over here, we have Maria.

14:16.439 --> 14:20.774
I made this selfie stick
out of a plunger and duct tape.

14:20.860 --> 14:24.228
Look at the link below
if you want directions.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.858
And over here,
we have my best friend, Maritza.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.863
- Say <i>hi, chiquita.
- No! Go</i> away!

14:31.954 --> 14:33.661
I already took my face off
from this morning.

14:33.748 --> 14:36.206
- I gotta put a new one on.
- No. This is a day in the life.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.453
For the people.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.285
Tell them what you're doing.
Come on.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.543
[sighs] Okay, fine. [clears throat]

14:44.592 --> 14:46.549
Hi, everybody!

14:46.636 --> 14:50.049
Okay, so what I'm doing now
is contour and highlight.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.220
When I wasn't in prison,

14:51.307 --> 14:55.517
I would do this with a MAC Pro Palette
and a #19 fan brush.

14:55.603 --> 14:59.892
But in here, I use three spices
that you can find in any kitchen.

14:59.982 --> 15:02.394
- Okay.
- Cinnamon...

15:02.485 --> 15:04.067
cumin...

15:04.153 --> 15:05.735
and Sazén Goya.

15:05.822 --> 15:09.281
Yes, your face will smell
like your abuela's pork.

15:09.367 --> 15:14.487
But listen, you gotta make sacrifices
if you wanna look DIY fly like me.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.070
[chuckles]

15:16.165 --> 15:18.702
First... contour.

15:23.506 --> 15:24.996
[groaning]

15:27.009 --> 15:28.295
[Angie groans]

15:31.681 --> 15:33.217
Where's the cheese?

15:34.684 --> 15:37.176
[retches and grunts]

15:38.354 --> 15:39.344
Fuck.

15:40.231 --> 15:42.939
[grunts] What cheese? [sighs]

15:43.025 --> 15:46.268
- I had cheese, didn't I?
-[retches]

15:46.362 --> 15:47.397
[groans]

15:47.488 --> 15:49.445
[chuckling] VVhQa!

15:49.532 --> 15:52.149
[laughing] Check it out.
Your puke is purple.

15:52.243 --> 15:54.826
Yeah, 'cause the cough syrup's red...

15:54.912 --> 15:57.449
[sniffs] and something was blue.

15:59.584 --> 16:00.665
[grunts]

16:03.880 --> 16:04.995
Hey!

16:08.050 --> 16:09.256
[softly] Someone stole the fucking gun.

16:11.554 --> 16:14.296
[chuckles] No, they didn't.
We hid it, remember?

16:15.224 --> 16:17.465
- We did?
- In the secret place!

16:18.936 --> 16:22.850
[gasps] Oh, yeah. The secret place
where no one else would ever find it.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.652
[Pidge] I'm from Hebei province in China,

16:33.743 --> 16:38.032
56 years old, 108 pounds, and--

16:38.122 --> 16:40.238
I'm annoying as fuck?
Who is Mei Chang?

16:40.917 --> 16:43.124
- Damn, Ouij!
- Stop pitching me softies. Come on.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.121
All right.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.078
All right.

16:47.798 --> 16:48.879
Okay-

16:50.009 --> 16:56.597
I'm from Omaha, Nebraska,
46 years old, 130 pounds,

16:56.682 --> 17:01.677
ashy-blonde hair
and I'm doing nine for media piracy.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.637
- Who is White Cindy?
- Seriously?

17:03.731 --> 17:06.393
Yo! My ass was just on the news!

17:06.483 --> 17:07.815
Yo, we're all on the news, dumb-ass.

17:07.902 --> 17:11.065
It's good 'cause people need to
start taking us serious--

17:11.155 --> 17:15.319
No, my actual ass.
See.

17:15.409 --> 17:17.570
-[Pidge] Yo.
-[chuckles]

17:18.746 --> 17:19.827
[Pidge] on...

17:19.914 --> 17:21.951
Really?
Way to keep it classy, perra.

17:22.040 --> 17:25.159
- That hoo-ha out, too? Shit.
-[Zirconia chuckles] I put it all out.

17:25.252 --> 17:26.914
[scattered chuckling]

17:29.048 --> 17:30.880
Um, can I help you with something?

17:30.967 --> 17:33.925
Where's Caputo? He's not in the pen
with the other little piggies.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.342
Nah, we put him in the Poo.
Why?

17:35.429 --> 17:37.796
I'm going to rip his balls off.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.091
[Zirconia] Oh, shit.

17:41.811 --> 17:42.846
[banging on window]

17:42.937 --> 17:46.305
Oh, this fucking guy again.
All morning, "I gotta go, I gotta go."

17:46.399 --> 17:47.560
Need to go to the bathroom!

17:47.650 --> 17:49.561
I think he gotta go big bathroom.

17:49.652 --> 17:52.861
[Maria] I think that
you need to shut the fuck up.

17:52.947 --> 17:55.780
We gave you a bucket.
Use the bucket.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.732
[Stratman] A bucket is not a toilet.

17:57.827 --> 18:00.694
Stratman, use the bucket.
You're gonna get us all killed.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.870
You don't understand.
[stutters] I can't.

18:02.957 --> 18:06.621
I mean, I can't
when there's other people around me.

18:06.711 --> 18:09.248
Since I was a kid.
I need total and utter privacy.

18:10.756 --> 18:13.498
- Please! Please let me out!
-[guards yelling]

18:14.427 --> 18:15.417
I don't know.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.841
God. Hey, does anyone here
know the brown note?

18:18.931 --> 18:20.171
[groans]

18:20.266 --> 18:21.722
Is that that jazz club in Harlem?

18:22.643 --> 18:23.758
What?

18:23.853 --> 18:25.343
No, it's the sound frequency

18:25.438 --> 18:27.850
that makes your bowls vibrate
and release automatically.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.773
- I saw it on <i>Brain</i> Buzzer.
- That's not a reputable source.

18:30.860 --> 18:31.895
Hey, Stratman...

18:32.903 --> 18:34.860
[humming low note]

18:37.867 --> 18:39.107
[grunts]

18:39.994 --> 18:42.486
[continues humming]

18:42.580 --> 18:44.116
[Stratman coughs]

18:44.206 --> 18:45.571
- Fuck. Nothing?
-[Blake] Keep going, keep going.

18:45.666 --> 18:48.533
-[humming continues]
-[Stratman] No, no, no. Oh, God.

18:50.796 --> 18:54.790
[grunts] Oh, stop, stop.
Stop. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.500
[cell phone ringing]

18:59.889 --> 19:01.755
Yeah?
Who's this?

19:01.849 --> 19:03.635
<i>[Gloria] Aleida?</i>

19:03.726 --> 19:05.137
Oh, my God, Gloria?

19:05.227 --> 19:07.969
<i>- What</i> the fuck number's <i>this?</i>
- I found a cell phone. [chuckles]

19:08.064 --> 19:09.646
<i>You found a cell phone
and you're calling me?</i>

19:09.732 --> 19:12.315
Damn, woman.
Ain't you got no real friends?

19:12.401 --> 19:14.984
We were only prison gay.
Minus the gay part.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.482
[chuckles]

19:16.572 --> 19:18.188
Yeah, what can I say?
I missed you.

19:18.824 --> 19:19.859
How's everything out there?

19:22.036 --> 19:25.245
I'm good.
Gettin' mad job offers.

19:26.207 --> 19:28.574
You know, different nail salons.

19:28.668 --> 19:32.127
After they seen my cheetah toes,
everybody been fightin' over me.

19:32.213 --> 19:34.671
- You see? I told you you'd kill it.
- Yeah.

19:35.925 --> 19:37.131
You called it.

19:38.469 --> 19:41.006
<i>How about you?
Same shit, same day?</i>

19:42.014 --> 19:44.927
Yeah.
Something like that. [chuckles]

19:45.810 --> 19:48.723
You all right, girl?
You sound funny.

19:50.064 --> 19:52.431
Listen, I gotta tell you something.

19:55.444 --> 19:58.357
<i>What?
What is it?</i>

20:00.116 --> 20:02.198
[sighs] Nothing.

20:04.286 --> 20:08.405
[sighs] I feel like I'm, you know,
losing my mind in here.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.206
My grip on things.

20:14.422 --> 20:15.753
You gotta do you, girl.

20:17.383 --> 20:20.296
<i>You seen that sign on the subway?
"See Something, Say Something"?</i>

20:20.386 --> 20:24.550
Do the opposite of that shit.
Say nothing, do nothing.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.802
Keep your chin down, do your fucking time,

20:26.892 --> 20:28.929
and don't take care
of nobody but yourself.

20:29.019 --> 20:30.134
[chuckles]

20:31.564 --> 20:33.271
Oh, thanks.
That's some good advice.

20:33.357 --> 20:35.519
<i>And Daya, of course.</i>

20:35.609 --> 20:38.727
Don't you be no self-centered bitch
when it comes to her.

20:38.821 --> 20:40.437
<i>She doin' all right?</i>

20:41.490 --> 20:42.821
Fine.
She's a good kid.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.616
<i>Well, tell her I'm busting my ass
out here, trying to get us set up,</i>

20:45.703 --> 20:49.196
so she better not be pullin' shit.
You tell her that from me.

20:49.290 --> 20:51.998
- Yeah, I'll tell her.
- All right.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.075
[cell phone beeps]

20:57.506 --> 20:58.746
[Pennsatucky grunts]

21:00.801 --> 21:01.916
Mmm. Don't touch.

21:02.011 --> 21:04.469
What, you don't like it when I...
when I brush your cheek like that?

21:04.555 --> 21:05.761
No, I like it just fine.

21:05.848 --> 21:08.761
You're just not supposed
to be doing anything that I don't say.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.467
- That's the rules.
- I'm sorry.

21:10.561 --> 21:12.268
- You gonna let me lead or not?
- Yes.

21:12.354 --> 21:13.890
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

21:15.191 --> 21:16.352
[Pennsatucky moans]

21:20.696 --> 21:22.357
Keep telling me
what you want me to do. I...

21:23.365 --> 21:25.732
I wanna do to you
what the vibrating phone did.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.196
Seeing you get turned on, it was...

21:29.371 --> 21:32.159
- It was so hot. I wanna turn you on.
-[chuckles]

21:32.833 --> 21:35.040
- You do? Well, then do it.
- Uh-huh.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.000
[Big Boo] You have got to
fucking be kidding me, Doggett.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.876
- What?
- Get the fuck outside.

21:46.180 --> 21:48.763
Quick, hide.
You have to hide.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.965
- Where?
<i>- I'll</i> show you where.

21:51.060 --> 21:53.802
- You can hide in here. Get... get in.
- What?

21:53.896 --> 21:54.977
[Pennsatucky] Trust me, I've seen it done.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.680
-[Coates] Seriously?
- People fit. Just get in.

21:56.774 --> 21:58.765
Get the fuck in there.

21:58.859 --> 22:00.896
Don't close it all the way. Shhh!

22:02.530 --> 22:04.567
-[inmates clamoring in the distance]
- Hey.

22:04.657 --> 22:07.149
Let me give you a little preview
of how this thing's gonna end.

22:07.243 --> 22:09.450
See, any minute now,
your boyfriend will be captured,

22:09.537 --> 22:12.199
taken to the bubble, where he will be
forced to shit in a bucket.

22:12.289 --> 22:14.781
And you'll be lucky if you're not tossed
in there right behind him.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.913
Is that what you want? Really?
To hold hands over a shit bucket?

22:20.005 --> 22:20.995
I don't know.

22:22.091 --> 22:23.547
What could you possibly not know?

22:23.634 --> 22:26.877
I don't know...
because it's chemical, Boo.

22:26.971 --> 22:29.759
Okay? It's like when
I used to cook meth, okay?

22:29.849 --> 22:31.760
I can't control the chemicals.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.808
I had to respect the chemicals.

22:33.894 --> 22:37.353
No matter how much I wanted different,
I had to respect the chemicals.

22:38.357 --> 22:41.600
Because lye doesn't feel anything
until it touches ephedrine.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.059
You know what I mean?

22:45.406 --> 22:46.396
[sighs]

22:47.491 --> 22:51.655
Have you ever...
wanted somebody that you shouldn't?

22:53.038 --> 22:54.995
Of course.

22:55.082 --> 22:56.368
It's called masturbating.

22:56.458 --> 23:00.122
Now, say goodbye
and walk the fuck away, son.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.794
God. God damn it.

23:07.511 --> 23:09.843
Now the Estée Lauder
makeup bag is our final offer

23:09.930 --> 23:14.470
and if you act now we'll throw in,
uh, lightly used lnvisalign braces.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.972
-[scoffs]
- Oh, wait. For what size mouth?

23:17.062 --> 23:18.848
Mmm. They might work for you, gappy.

23:18.939 --> 23:20.350
Hey, my gap is awesome.

23:20.441 --> 23:22.523
I just wanna fix my left pointy tooth
'cause it's a little twisty.

23:22.610 --> 23:26.604
No! We didn't get
into the slave business for braces.

into the SHU arbitrarily.

We're denied proper health care, dental.

38:38.983 --> 38:41.270

to the doctor.

'cause there ain't enough bathrooms.

to breastfeed our babies.

for no reason.

- Yeah.

You can't let
this white woman speak for us.

out her mouth.

Come on, man. I know you saw them people
out there with them Judy King signs.

39:29.117 --> 39:30.949
They want to hear from her.

39:31.035 --> 39:33.993
And it would be smart of us
if we put her out there.

39:34.080 --> 39:37.823
They'll hear more of what we saying
if it comes from her mouth.

39:37.917 --> 39:41.160
Yeah, but she's never been
a real prisoner a day in her life.

or replace them over the summer.

45:05.161 --> 45:06.993
[Caputo] What about your kid, Ruiz?

45:07.079 --> 45:08.285
Think about her.

45:09.290 --> 45:13.909
If you help me, I can make sure
your sentence doesn't get extended.

45:14.003 --> 45:15.493
Hey, no kicking!

45:15.588 --> 45:17.750
Piscatella already put five more years
on my sentence

45:17.840 --> 45:19.422
for no fucking reason, all right?

45:19.508 --> 45:22.045
My daughter won't even know my name
by the time I get out anyway.

45:22.136 --> 45:23.968
Ruiz, are you sure he put time on you?

45:24.055 --> 45:26.046
'Course I'm sure!

45:26.140 --> 45:28.552
[Caputo] You... you had a hearing already?

45:28.643 --> 45:31.556
-[sighs] No.
-[Caputo] Then it's not a done deal.

45:31.646 --> 45:34.058
And with the speed
paperwork moves around Litchfield,

45:34.148 --> 45:35.388
I wouldn't be surprised

45:35.483 --> 45:38.350
if his recommendation
is not even in your file yet.

45:39.111 --> 45:40.476
Have you seen your file?

45:42.406 --> 45:46.195
Piscatella, he's a... monster.

45:46.285 --> 45:50.529
He should never have been working here
in the first place, and that's my fault.

45:50.623 --> 45:56.915
But you do not have to become the monster
he's making you out to be.

45:57.004 --> 46:00.122
I've seen you with the other inmates.

46:01.509 --> 46:02.999
They look up to you.

46:04.011 --> 46:06.548
Huh? Ruiz?

46:07.473 --> 46:08.713
[Stratman farts and groans]

46:10.768 --> 46:12.725
-[Stratman grunts]
- Stratman?

46:12.812 --> 46:14.268
[panting]

46:15.189 --> 46:16.771
[sighing]

46:17.858 --> 46:18.848
Oh, fuck.

46:19.944 --> 46:21.776
[indistinct chatter]

46:33.374 --> 46:36.583
Okay, enough.
You have to tell me what's going on.

46:36.669 --> 46:38.455
What?

46:38.546 --> 46:42.710
Why there is an army of lemmings
dressed like you, moving out here.

46:45.428 --> 46:48.591
- You sound insane.
- I am not insane!

46:48.681 --> 46:50.843
You're gaslighting me right now.

46:50.933 --> 46:52.298
- And technically...
-[Alex sighs]

46:52.393 --> 46:53.599
...do you know that's emotional abuse?

46:53.686 --> 46:55.768
Do you know
how I know that's emotional abuse?

46:55.896 --> 47:00.106
I read it in an online quiz once,
called "Are You Being Emotionally Abused?"

47:04.655 --> 47:06.487
Okay, I may have shared some...

47:07.408 --> 47:11.276
some things in my history
with a few inmates and it resonated.

47:11.370 --> 47:14.579
- They think I stand for something.
- What things from your history?

47:15.541 --> 47:16.997
That I killed Aydin.

47:18.085 --> 47:19.541
You told them that you killed Aydin?

47:19.628 --> 47:22.165
I didn't say Aydin specifically.

47:23.215 --> 47:25.252
I just shared my...

47:25.343 --> 47:27.835
I don't know, status as a...
as a murderess.

47:27.928 --> 47:29.293
I don't know, it just came out.

47:29.388 --> 47:30.924
We were supposed to take that
to the grave.

47:31.015 --> 47:33.052
I went to Von Barlow and I begged her

47:33.142 --> 47:35.304
-to keep it a secret--
- I didn't ask you to do that.

47:35.394 --> 47:36.976
So, what?
Do you not want a future with me?

47:37.063 --> 47:38.269
Do you not want a real house?

47:38.356 --> 47:41.849
It's not a real house if I can't carry
my truth inside it, Piper.

47:41.942 --> 47:43.478
And now you sound
like a fucking E.E. Cummings poem.

47:43.569 --> 47:44.730
I'm not sorry.

47:44.820 --> 47:48.688
Yeah, it sucks that they turned it into
some symbol of the resistance or whatever,

47:48.783 --> 47:51.445
but I am glad I said it out loud.

47:51.535 --> 47:54.323
Now, I want to lay down
in my tchotchke nook

47:54.413 --> 47:57.781
and I wanna relax
until this whole thing blows over.

47:58.834 --> 48:01.121
They heard what they wanted to.

48:02.004 --> 48:04.041
They turned it
into some kind of a symbol.

48:05.299 --> 48:09.964
What you do and what you say
affects people, Alex.

48:10.888 --> 48:12.720
-[sighs]
- It affects me.

48:14.683 --> 48:19.393
And if you do not curate your shit,
you are not a collector.

48:19.480 --> 48:21.767
- You're a hoarder.
- Okay, great.

48:21.857 --> 48:24.064
Very mature. Where're you...
Where are you going?

48:24.151 --> 48:25.687
I am going to the guest room.

48:25.778 --> 48:26.813
Oh.

48:28.739 --> 48:32.232
I'm from Fresno, California,
46 years old, Puerto Rican,

48:32.326 --> 48:34.408
-doing 11 years for armed robbery--
- Who's Rosalita Pontz?

48:34.495 --> 48:36.361
[inmates murmuring]

48:37.206 --> 48:41.120
I'm from North Philly,
5'9", 285 pounds.

48:41.210 --> 48:42.917
I got no identifying marks, and--

48:43.003 --> 48:44.869
Who's Jodi Winkler?

48:44.964 --> 48:46.170
[inmate] What?

48:46.257 --> 48:47.668
She's like Rain Man.

48:48.717 --> 48:50.549
Yo, you idiots got my file?

48:53.305 --> 48:54.670
Who's Maria Ruiz?

48:58.477 --> 48:59.638
[sighs]

49:02.398 --> 49:05.607
[Pidge] I'm from Kingston, New York.
5'4", 180 pounds.

49:05.693 --> 49:07.229
I got a rose tattoo.

49:07.319 --> 49:09.401
-[continues indistinctly]
-[Ouija] Jessie...

49:09.488 --> 49:11.104
-[Pidge grunts]
-[inmate] Whoo!

49:12.825 --> 49:16.284
"This prison has put me through
unimaginable suffering,

49:16.370 --> 49:18.281
and I am not a victim of this riot.

49:18.372 --> 49:20.830
I am an active participant.

49:20.916 --> 49:23.999
Together, we stand united, protesting..."

49:24.086 --> 49:26.874
No. Uh, should it be "united we stand"?

49:26.964 --> 49:30.207
- Like the Pledge of Allegiance?
- No. "We stand united."

49:30.301 --> 49:33.919
"Protesting how unfair this system is."

49:34.013 --> 49:35.879
"How unfair this system is."

49:35.973 --> 49:38.590
No, no.
"How unfair this system is."

49:38.684 --> 49:41.392
Yes, yes, that's it.
And punch the words. Don't forget.

49:41.479 --> 49:44.847
- You think this is gonna work?
-[Alison] This gotta work.

49:44.940 --> 49:47.147
- It's the only play we got.
-[crowd chanting] Free Judy King!

49:47.234 --> 49:50.067
They sure ain't chanting for Poussey
out there. Are they, T?

49:50.154 --> 49:55.866
"The waiter served a dinner roll
to the woman that was well buttered."

49:55.951 --> 49:57.066
Come on, guys.

49:57.161 --> 50:00.028
Who can fix the misplaced modifier
in that sentence?

50:00.956 --> 50:01.946
Anyone?

50:04.627 --> 50:05.617
Janae?

50:08.380 --> 50:12.840
"The waiter served a dinner roll
that was well buttered to the woman."

50:12.927 --> 50:14.213
Everyone?

50:15.221 --> 50:16.757
Do we see why?

50:17.890 --> 50:18.925
[school bell ringing]

50:20.434 --> 50:21.799
Okay, we'll pick up here tomorrow

50:21.894 --> 50:24.010
and then we'll move on
to dangling modifiers.

50:24.104 --> 50:26.766
Janae?
A word, please.

50:33.531 --> 50:36.694
I need your mom to sign this,
so she knows you got a D.

50:36.784 --> 50:39.651
It's hard for me to write grades
like this on your work, Janae.

50:39.745 --> 50:41.611
I know what you're capable of.

50:41.705 --> 50:44.413
Whatever.
Not like it's a real paper.

50:44.500 --> 50:45.615
What do you mean?

50:45.709 --> 50:49.498
I mean, we ain't quoting secondary sources
using APA or MLA,

50:49.588 --> 50:52.250
and we ain't studying SAT words
or growing salad,

50:52.341 --> 50:53.831
and we don't even
have a library in this school

50:53.926 --> 50:56.463
'cause it got made into a nursery
for our fucking hood rat babies!

50:56.554 --> 50:57.544
Janae.

50:57.638 --> 51:00.551
Two zip codes from here
they got laptops and art galleries.

51:00.641 --> 51:03.474
They got so much culture, they ain't
even knowin' they stealin' ours.

51:03.561 --> 51:05.143
It's a load of shit.

51:08.065 --> 51:09.146
You're right.

51:11.318 --> 51:13.559
I wish you weren't, but it's true.

51:13.654 --> 51:16.396
The Thurston students are
privileged and advantaged,

51:16.490 --> 51:19.448
and sometimes you feel like you have to
work twice as hard to get half as far,

51:19.535 --> 51:21.697
but that doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.

51:21.787 --> 51:23.698
Okay?
You belong with the brightest--

51:23.789 --> 51:26.281
But why even bother
playin' a game that's rigged?

51:26.375 --> 51:27.865
Courtney's going
to a science camp this summer

51:27.960 --> 51:30.418
that cost more than my dad makes
in three months.

51:30.504 --> 51:31.994
How could I ever compete?

51:34.049 --> 51:35.835
I'll see ya, Miss Fowler.

51:43.517 --> 51:44.507
[Pennsatucky] I don't know, you guys.

51:44.602 --> 51:46.559
I just think that we should have
a little bit of fun with him,

51:46.645 --> 51:48.511
you know, like, torture him.

51:48.606 --> 51:50.563
One by one.
I'll go first.

51:50.649 --> 51:52.139
[Coates panting]

51:54.695 --> 51:57.813
Nah, I don't like that show.
Change the channel.

51:57.906 --> 52:00.147
-[panting]
{grunts}

52:00.242 --> 52:01.698
These guard uniforms are itchy.

52:04.580 --> 52:07.447
Maybe we should change them
after we dump him?

52:07.541 --> 52:09.498
[Leanne] Yeah!
Let's wear bedsheet togas and trip again.

52:09.585 --> 52:10.996
Mmm, yeah!

52:11.086 --> 52:12.872
Oh, yeah.
And maybe we'll find the gun that way.

52:12.963 --> 52:15.295
'Cause we'll go, like, full circle
and remember where we put it.

52:15.382 --> 52:16.372
[Leanne] Yeah.

52:16.467 --> 52:17.548
[Pennsatucky] Freeze!

52:17.635 --> 52:20.172
Put your hands up!
Put your hands up! Get over there.

52:20.262 --> 52:24.096
- You stole our gun?
- No, it was in her belt.

52:24.183 --> 52:26.971
- Angie, are you fucking kidding me?
- What?

52:27.061 --> 52:28.927
You put it on your belt!

52:29.021 --> 52:31.012
[sighs] I didn't even know
I was wearing a belt.

52:31.940 --> 52:33.726
I must have put it on
when I was fucked up.

52:33.817 --> 52:38.152
Which is weird, because I hate belts.
They give me camel toe.

52:38.238 --> 52:39.444
[sighs]

52:39.531 --> 52:43.320
Intake is your best bet out, okay?
But be really careful in the hallways.

52:43.410 --> 52:44.445
Here, take it.

52:45.329 --> 52:46.410
[grunts]

52:46.497 --> 52:47.987
Oh, shit!

52:48.082 --> 52:49.197
- What the fuck!
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

52:49.291 --> 52:50.326
Shit. I'm sorry! It was...

52:50.417 --> 52:52.158
-[Leanne] Shut the fuck...
- It was an accident.

52:52.252 --> 52:54.584
You shot my favorite finger,

52:54.672 --> 52:56.583
-you fucking asshole!
- Go.

52:56.674 --> 52:58.665
- But I can't leave you.
- You have to go, okay?

52:58.759 --> 52:59.920
Just go. Hurry.

53:00.010 --> 53:01.967
- Ooh... fuck. [groans]
-[Angie] Oh, my God.

53:02.054 --> 53:03.715
-[groaning] Fucker!
- Are you gonna die?

53:05.015 --> 53:07.177
- You are so gonna pay for this.
-[groans]

53:08.519 --> 53:09.975
- Get her!
-[Angie] Bitch!

53:24.785 --> 53:27.243
What? No...
No, I gotta do the PR.

53:28.122 --> 53:29.237
[inmates gasping]

53:40.134 --> 53:41.920
-[reporters clamoring]
-[reporter] Judy. Judy King.

53:42.010 --> 53:43.921
Judy King, are you a Muslim now?

53:44.012 --> 53:47.050
Judy. Judy King.
Are you a Muslim now?

53:47.141 --> 53:48.256
[clamoring continues]

53:48.350 --> 53:50.887
You want me to talk first
or make an introduction?

53:50.978 --> 53:52.560
-[crowd chanting] Judy!
- No, I'll start.

53:52.646 --> 53:53.886
[reporter] Did they hurt you at all?

53:53.981 --> 53:56.063
- Are you in anyjeopardy?
-[chanting continues]

53:56.150 --> 53:57.390
[crowd quiets down]

53:58.610 --> 54:00.851
[Taystee] Good morning.
My name...

54:01.864 --> 54:05.823
is Tasha Jefferson
and I'm an inmate here at Litchfield.

54:05.909 --> 54:08.071
Two days ago,

54:08.162 --> 54:12.747
our friend and fellow inmate,
Poussey Washington,

54:12.833 --> 54:14.949
was murdered by a prison guard.

54:15.043 --> 54:17.034
[camera shutters clicking]

54:17.129 --> 54:18.494
Poussey Washington.

54:19.381 --> 54:23.340
And I'm sayin' her name again
because it can't ever be said enough.

54:24.845 --> 54:28.258
Now, as you can see,
Judy King ain't injured

54:28.348 --> 54:30.339
and she ain't a hostage.

54:31.226 --> 54:34.969
And she has a statement
that she'd like to make at this time.

54:35.939 --> 54:38.271
[Judy] And good morning,
my fellow Americans.

54:39.318 --> 54:43.312
"This prison has put me
through unimaginable suffering.

54:43.405 --> 54:47.649
- And I am not a victim of this riot--"
- No, [stutters] she will not--

54:47.743 --> 54:50.030
She is not gonna be making a statement.

54:51.038 --> 54:52.620
Sorry.

54:52.706 --> 54:54.697
She will not be speaking for us

54:54.792 --> 54:59.787
because Judy King can't speak
for the inmates of this prison.

54:59.880 --> 55:01.996
She was kept separate from us,

55:02.090 --> 55:06.379
held in a private room
with better treatment and a seltzer-maker.

55:06.470 --> 55:11.215
And moments after our friend,
Poussey Washington,

55:11.308 --> 55:15.347
was murdered by a guard
for doin' nothin' wrong,

55:15.437 --> 55:19.647
Judy King was packing her bags
to go home on early release.

55:20.651 --> 55:25.566
Because she's rich and white and powerful.

55:26.573 --> 55:28.655
[camera shutters clicking]

55:28.742 --> 55:32.360
Now, our fight is not with Judy King.

55:32.454 --> 55:36.493
Our fight is with a system
that don't give a damn

55:36.583 --> 55:42.295
about poor people and brown people
and poor brown people.

55:43.257 --> 55:44.713
[sobbing] Our fight...

55:46.009 --> 55:47.420
is with the folks...

55:48.804 --> 55:52.513
who hold our demands in their hands.

55:53.684 --> 55:55.766
Which you people need to read,
by the way,

55:55.853 --> 55:59.437
and stop watching this fool shit
comin' out of here online

55:59.523 --> 56:05.644
and get a hold of our demand list because
those demands are fair and necessary,

56:05.737 --> 56:09.571
and show that we intend
to keep this demonstration

56:09.658 --> 56:13.196
peaceful and focused on change.

56:14.955 --> 56:18.038
Now, Judy King is free to leave.

56:18.125 --> 56:20.332
She's not a hostage
and you can have her back.

56:20.419 --> 56:22.626
Judy, get the hell out of here.

56:23.547 --> 56:25.379
[reporters clamoring]

56:29.261 --> 56:31.673
Oh, my God.
What did I just do?

56:31.763 --> 56:33.424
[sighs heavily]

56:33.515 --> 56:35.051
You fuckin' freed my ho!

56:36.810 --> 56:38.721
