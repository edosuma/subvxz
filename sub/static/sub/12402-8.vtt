[Maria] <i>I'm a pterodactyl.</i>

00:22.941 --> 00:26.486
[chanting] Om.

00:27.278 --> 00:29.906
Not to be too forward,
but when was the last time

00:29.989 --> 00:32.325
that you felt the heaving touch of a man?

00:32.408 --> 00:36.913
-Um... do blowies count?
-No, God! Ew, who does that?

00:36.996 --> 00:38.206
A lot of people.

00:38.289 --> 00:40.792
Really? That's what they're telling you.

00:42.627 --> 00:46.047
The last time I had
actual intercourse was a year ago.

00:46.130 --> 00:48.675
You wanna know what I do
when I don't have a man?

00:48.758 --> 00:50.718
-No.
-I jam a cat paw up there.

00:50.802 --> 00:51.844
-Oh, God.
-Yup.

00:51.928 --> 00:55.848
I'm talking about my friend
Danny Katpaw. My deaf friend.

00:55.932 --> 00:57.976
Come on. Oh, you've got a sick mind.

00:58.059 --> 00:59.561
You really do need to get some action.

00:59.644 --> 01:00.853
-[chuckling]
-Your brain is being flooded

01:00.937 --> 01:02.981
-with toxins and sex poisons.
-Mmm.

01:03.064 --> 01:04.147
That's not a joke.

01:05.191 --> 01:07.402
-I just need to have sex once a year...
-Mmm-hmm.

01:07.485 --> 01:09.946
...and then all good
under the hood and...

01:10.029 --> 01:11.531
Actually though, speaking of,

01:11.614 --> 01:13.199
when is Vaginismus this year?

01:13.324 --> 01:14.826
Is that a Greek harvest holiday?

01:14.909 --> 01:15.994
Greek harvest holiday?

01:16.077 --> 01:19.372
No, it's the one day a year
that I, medically speaking...

01:19.455 --> 01:21.040
I have to have sex.

01:21.124 --> 01:23.835
-Oh.
-Otherwise, my vagina could close up.

01:23.918 --> 01:26.170
[stuttering] I told you to put it
on my calendar.

01:26.254 --> 01:27.630
Are you still my assistant?

01:28.423 --> 01:30.717
-What?
-I just-- I wasn't sure--

01:30.800 --> 01:32.176
[chuckles] Of course, I am.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.845
How could you even ask me that?

01:33.928 --> 01:37.724
After everything I've done for you,
and am currently doing for you!

01:37.807 --> 01:39.017
-Sorry for saying...
-Oh, my God.

01:39.100 --> 01:42.270
[chanting] Om.

01:42.353 --> 01:44.981
-Okay. I want you to repeat after me.
-Okay.

01:45.064 --> 01:46.983
-I am confident.
-I am confident.

01:47.066 --> 01:48.693
-I am calm.
-I am calm.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.695
And I am going to
nail that audition today.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.989
-Audition?
-Oh, God, did I not tell you?

01:53.072 --> 01:55.408
It's at 4:00 p.m. on the Fox lot.

01:56.701 --> 01:58.077
It's 3:45!

01:58.161 --> 02:00.330
Well, then you better get on the get, huh?

02:00.413 --> 02:02.582
-You lazy bones.
-[squealing] Come on!

02:02.665 --> 02:05.001
All right, assistant work complete
for today.

02:09.464 --> 02:11.341
Hi. Maria Bamford. I'm a little late.

02:11.424 --> 02:13.009
I drove here in the turning lane.

02:13.092 --> 02:15.178
Yeah, but I didn't make up any time

02:15.261 --> 02:17.597
because I had to make
four unwanted left turns.

02:17.680 --> 02:21.100
But, working on my confidence.
I hate auditions. Ugh.

02:21.184 --> 02:22.727
Sorry, you're not on the list.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.772
That's impossible,
'cause I have an appointment at 4:00 p.m.

02:25.855 --> 02:27.398
in the Seth MacFarlane building.

02:27.482 --> 02:29.776
You can make a U-turn here
and call your contact.

02:29.859 --> 02:32.612
Richard... please let me in.

02:32.695 --> 02:37.533
I haven't had an audition in six months
since I had a minor mental crisis...

02:37.617 --> 02:40.411
and I need to get
this audition monkey off my back.

02:40.495 --> 02:42.830
-Make a U-turn here, please.
-Okay.

02:45.792 --> 02:46.793
Sorry, Richard!

02:46.876 --> 02:49.212
-Audition monkey!
-[tires squealing]

02:49.295 --> 02:50.671
Hey! Hey!

02:50.755 --> 02:52.465
Motherfucker!

02:53.633 --> 02:55.134
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

02:55.218 --> 02:57.470
Security was tight, so...

02:59.430 --> 03:01.349
So are we gonna fuck or what?

03:01.432 --> 03:03.393
I ain't your bitch!

03:03.476 --> 03:04.602
If you're gonna stand there
looking at me,

03:04.685 --> 03:06.938
you're either gonna fuck me
or fight me.

03:07.063 --> 03:09.524
I'm gonna cut you, motherfucker.

03:09.607 --> 03:11.651
I ain't raised to be a sucker.

03:11.734 --> 03:16.239
I am a strong black man
and I care for my sisters.

03:16.322 --> 03:19.992
And if you think I'm gonna
let you walk out of Cookie's life...

03:20.076 --> 03:23.496
you're gonna walk right into this fist.
And this one!

03:23.579 --> 03:25.581
And I wear rings!

03:25.665 --> 03:28.000
Motherfucker!

03:36.092 --> 03:38.678
I'm not in the right place, am I?

03:38.761 --> 03:41.681
You just read
for a 22-year-old black male...

03:41.764 --> 03:42.849
Okay.

03:42.932 --> 03:44.851
...and nailed it.

03:45.768 --> 03:47.687
Oh, thank you. Thank you for that.

03:47.770 --> 03:51.315
[stuttering] I've been so nervous
about auditioning, and I...

03:51.399 --> 03:53.568
Maybe I've been auditioning
for the wrong parts.

03:53.651 --> 03:54.986
What was that part again?

03:55.069 --> 03:57.447
Cookie's younger brother Nibbles,
on <i>Empire.</i>

03:57.530 --> 03:58.573
[softly] Oh, okay.

03:58.656 --> 04:00.575
I don't mean to speak for the producers,

04:00.658 --> 04:04.203
but I think they need
to reconceive this whole part.

04:04.287 --> 04:07.790
Oh, my gosh. I'm gonna have
to thank my assistant after I kill her.

04:07.874 --> 04:08.875
[laughing]

04:08.958 --> 04:10.918
That is so Nibbles.

04:11.002 --> 04:13.504
I am Nibbles. [laughing]

04:15.173 --> 04:16.382
Thank you so much.

04:18.384 --> 04:19.719
Bye, Richard!

04:20.553 --> 04:22.597
-Sorry, it slipped.
-The fuck?

04:22.680 --> 04:24.515
[Maria] That was so Nibbles.

04:26.058 --> 04:27.310
[Bruce] I'm so sorry.

04:27.393 --> 04:29.520
I promise it'll be addressed
by this evening.

04:29.604 --> 04:31.314
Thank you so much.

04:31.397 --> 04:32.648
Ah, my American girl.

04:32.732 --> 04:35.485
Bruce, I haven't been
able to get through to you.

04:35.568 --> 04:36.986
I'm so sorry, my angel.

04:37.069 --> 04:39.155
I've been up to my ass
in Kindler problems.

04:39.238 --> 04:42.784
A dead sex worker in Reseda
was found holding his headshot.

04:42.867 --> 04:44.702
-Oh... got it.
-[phone ringing]

04:46.537 --> 04:47.580
[ringing continues]

04:50.249 --> 04:51.918
Chantrelle, are you gonna get that?

04:52.001 --> 04:53.628
Your hand broken?

04:54.962 --> 04:56.672
[ringing continues]

04:57.215 --> 05:00.051
We do this <i>Cagney & Lacey </i> thing,
really keeps me on my toes.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.552
I just love it.

05:01.636 --> 05:02.929
Go for Bruce.

05:03.012 --> 05:05.056
Yes, Fox Studios. Great, go ahead.

05:05.139 --> 05:06.140
Yes, what a coincidence.

05:06.224 --> 05:08.017
I happen to have her right in front of me.

05:08.851 --> 05:10.353
Well, that's terrific.

05:10.436 --> 05:12.855
Absolutely. Yes, indeed.

05:13.648 --> 05:17.443
I know she'll be thrilled to hear that.
Most definitely. Uh-huh.

05:17.527 --> 05:18.569
Yes, for sure.

05:19.570 --> 05:23.199
Yes. I'm sure we're on the same page
with that.

05:23.282 --> 05:25.117
Okay, wonderful. Bye for now.

05:29.121 --> 05:30.581
What did they say?

05:30.665 --> 05:33.709
Did you break onto the Fox lot,
audition for the wrong teleseries,

05:33.793 --> 05:36.546
then throw a scalding
hot beverage at a security guard?

05:37.547 --> 05:40.299
[stammering] Well, it wasn't that hot.

05:40.383 --> 05:41.842
And... it just got away from me.

05:41.926 --> 05:44.512
My hands were all slippery
from Larissa's hot oils.

05:44.595 --> 05:47.098
The less I know about
you <i>Sisters of Sappho,</i> the better.

05:47.181 --> 05:51.060
But the point is, you're now officially
banned for life from the Fox lot.

05:51.143 --> 05:53.854
Well, that's horrible.
[stuttering] What about <i>Empire?</i>

05:53.980 --> 05:56.816
They called several hours ago
with a nice, firm "no, thank you."

05:56.899 --> 05:58.693
But you did give them a noggin nudge,

05:58.776 --> 06:01.529
so that they recast Nibbles
as a blonde, white woman.

06:01.612 --> 06:04.365
So, big congrats in order
for one Amy Schumer.

06:05.616 --> 06:07.785
But why did you give me the thumbs up...

06:07.868 --> 06:11.581
and make the money gestures
and show me the money rock?

06:11.664 --> 06:14.000
Was I doing that? It's this crazy tick...

06:14.083 --> 06:15.960
that I have when I get nervous...

06:16.043 --> 06:17.753
[stutters] or if I'm lying, you know?

06:17.837 --> 06:19.046
Do you feel nervous now?

06:19.130 --> 06:20.965
-No, I've never been calmer.
-Huh.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.133
[Maria] <i>So I was finished at Fox.</i>

06:22.216 --> 06:25.011
<i>Who cares? I'm not afraid of them.</i>

06:25.094 --> 06:27.221
<i>There's only one person I'm afraid of.</i>

06:27.305 --> 06:29.765
-Look who's back in town, Hollyweird!
-Oh, God.

06:29.849 --> 06:31.350
[Maria] <i>Kirsten Rydholm.</i>

06:31.434 --> 06:33.686
Let's see what all that
Jew money buys you, huh?

06:33.769 --> 06:36.314
[laughing]
Let's see, you got...

06:36.397 --> 06:40.526
Twenty boxes of Monistat
and an <i>US</i> magazine.

06:40.610 --> 06:42.528
Oh, wow, looks like things
haven't changed that much

06:42.612 --> 06:44.113
-since junior high.
-Well...

06:44.196 --> 06:48.367
Remember when you perioded
all over the gym mat?

06:48.451 --> 06:52.330
Oh, my God. I have a photo of that
and I posted it on Facebook.

06:52.413 --> 06:53.873
I got so many responses.

06:53.956 --> 06:55.875
I still talk about that in therapy.

06:55.958 --> 06:58.836
These are for the downtown women's center.

06:58.919 --> 07:02.089
-Yeah, makes sense... lez.
-Okay.

07:02.173 --> 07:03.966
So, you're the Checklist lady, huh?

07:04.050 --> 07:05.468
-Yeah.
-Ooh.

07:05.551 --> 07:08.429
-They sure as shoot photoshopped you.
-Yeah, I know.

07:08.512 --> 07:09.889
God, you look like shit.

07:09.972 --> 07:11.182
-I know.
-What's wrong?

07:11.265 --> 07:13.935
You're sure not being friendly.
Don't you remember me?

07:14.018 --> 07:16.729
[stuttering] Yes...
you're Kirsten Rydholm.

07:16.812 --> 07:20.524
-Uh, Kirsten Rydholm-Rydholm.
-Oh.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.568
I married Dougie Rydholm.
[chuckling]

07:22.652 --> 07:24.403
Oh, he's your cousin. That's cool.

07:24.487 --> 07:26.864
-Fourth cousin, you bitch.
-Okay.

07:26.948 --> 07:29.450
-So, what about you? You married?
-Not currently.

07:29.533 --> 07:33.329
Oh, that is so sad.

07:33.412 --> 07:35.039
Hey, you know what?

07:35.122 --> 07:37.458
I think these are on sale,
but I'm not sure.

07:37.541 --> 07:40.002
-No, you--
-Let me do a price check for you. No.

07:40.086 --> 07:41.837
-You're gonna want me to.
-That's not necessary.

07:41.921 --> 07:43.005
-No, please don't.
-[intercom feedback]

07:43.089 --> 07:45.049
[over intercom]
Hey, could I get a price check

07:45.132 --> 07:46.634
on 20 boxes of cooch cream

07:46.717 --> 07:50.471
for Checklist's own spokeswoman,
Maria Bamford...

07:50.554 --> 07:52.640
[chuckling] who has a dirty downtown?

07:53.724 --> 07:56.310
Listen, remind me
not to go to spin class with you.

07:56.394 --> 07:58.688
That's what all you d-bags
do out in LA, right?

07:58.813 --> 08:00.815
That and jerk each other off
on the freeways

08:00.898 --> 08:02.692
while you're drinking your soda.

08:02.775 --> 08:04.527
[Maria] We'll get them
no matter what the cost.

08:04.610 --> 08:08.489
Oh, "No matter what the cost"
'cause you're all Hollywood up in here.

08:08.572 --> 08:11.951
Yeah! I got you. I'll see you up front.

08:13.953 --> 08:16.789
Isn't that Maria Bamford?

08:16.872 --> 08:19.291
I hear she's bipolar.

08:21.002 --> 08:22.586
Oh, that's Maria Bamford.

08:22.670 --> 08:25.172
I heard she bought
two Polaris snowmobiles.

08:26.924 --> 08:29.635
Ronny Duggard told me
Maria Bamford's engaged

08:29.719 --> 08:33.222
to the Polaris snowmobile heir,
Dennis Ericson.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.683
-Oh, Marilyn, hi.
-Hi.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.102
Oh, congratulations on the engagement.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.477
Oh, thank you.

08:39.562 --> 08:43.024
Yeah... we're...
we're sure as sugar proud of her.

08:43.107 --> 08:44.107
Wow... [chuckling]

08:44.191 --> 08:46.235
I just overheard in aisle four,

08:46.318 --> 08:50.531
that you are engaged
to Dennis Ericson, the Polaris heir.

08:50.614 --> 08:52.491
How come you didn't tell me
you're rich as shit?

08:52.575 --> 08:53.617
What are you talking about?

08:53.701 --> 08:55.494
I fucked it up all these years.

08:55.578 --> 08:57.413
I've been a piece of shit to you, Maria.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.623
So, you know, I'm sorry.

09:00.791 --> 09:04.378
[over intercom] Attitude check
on Kirsten Rydholm-Rydholm.

09:04.462 --> 09:06.255
-[feedback]
-Adjusted.

09:06.338 --> 09:08.174
-Wow.
-You should come over on Sunday.

09:08.257 --> 09:11.093
We're gonna grill up some brats,
watch the game, you know.

09:11.177 --> 09:14.138
I'll put some plastic on the couch...
so you can sit on it.

09:14.221 --> 09:18.017
You know, on account
of your rotten cooter. [laughing]

09:18.100 --> 09:21.437
Kirsten, I've been waiting my whole life
to hear something that nice from you.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.814
But I think you have some facts wrong.

09:23.898 --> 09:25.399
Hey, can I ask you something?

09:25.483 --> 09:27.109
Could you get me a free snowmobile?

09:27.193 --> 09:29.445
But you were horrible to me
in high school.

09:29.528 --> 09:30.529
Right, I know. But...

09:30.613 --> 09:32.740
I like you better now that you're rich.

09:32.823 --> 09:35.117
Not many friends are going to admit that.

09:35.993 --> 09:37.661
What do you say?

09:37.745 --> 09:40.915
[softly] Take the win.
And don't forget the blue gum, honey.

09:41.457 --> 09:42.792
I'll talk to Dennis...

09:42.875 --> 09:43.918
and... and...

09:44.001 --> 09:45.669
we'll see you Sunday.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.004
Okay.

09:47.088 --> 09:49.965
[Maria] <i>I've always had a hard time</i>
<i>being direct with people.</i>

09:50.049 --> 09:52.176
<i>But now that I was banned</i>
<i>from the Fox lot for life,</i>

09:52.259 --> 09:53.511
<i>I had nothing to lose.</i>

09:53.594 --> 09:55.554
[Maria] Larissa, we need to talk.

09:55.638 --> 09:56.639
Oh, my God, Maria,

09:56.722 --> 09:59.934
that is exactly what I was gonna say
if I saw you first.

10:00.726 --> 10:02.937
I'm sorry... I don't know... Who are you?

10:03.020 --> 10:04.230
-Carol Simples.
-[Maria] Oh.

10:04.313 --> 10:05.898
I'm Larissa's business coach.

10:05.981 --> 10:10.111
My company is called Ladies Get to Work,
parentheses, Like a Man.

10:10.194 --> 10:12.029
-Oh, very nice.
-[Carol clicks tongue]

10:12.113 --> 10:14.824
I felt like I was dropping the ball
as your assistant,

10:14.907 --> 10:18.661
so I brought in Carol here to help
with her awesome methodologies.

10:18.744 --> 10:21.956
Okay, that sounds good.
Doesn't sound not good. [chuckling]

10:22.039 --> 10:23.249
You're goddamn right, it doesn't.

10:23.332 --> 10:26.460
Now I am just gonna stand
right over here and observe.

10:26.544 --> 10:28.712
So, what did you wanna talk to me about?

10:28.796 --> 10:30.422
You sent me to the wrong audition.

10:30.506 --> 10:31.799
You've been mixing up appointments.

10:31.882 --> 10:33.926
It's driving me crazy
and I want things to change.

10:34.009 --> 10:36.387
And I think I know exactly what that is.

10:36.470 --> 10:40.891
It's Chapter Two in my book,
<i>Keepin' It Carol,</i> Carol Simples.

10:41.767 --> 10:45.688
[gasps] Oh, that's fun that you didn't go
with the obvious pun.

10:46.605 --> 10:47.606
What do you mean?

10:47.690 --> 10:49.108
<i>Keepin' It Simples.</i>

10:49.191 --> 10:52.361
Oh, my God! I left it on the table. Shit!

10:52.444 --> 10:55.447
Fuck! What am I gonna do
with all those fucking mugs?

10:55.531 --> 10:57.408
What, I got to pay you now?
Do I have to pay you?

10:57.491 --> 11:00.953
No, I don't. Because you know what?
We don't have a contract.

11:01.036 --> 11:03.998
And that is smart business.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.878
Carol has taught me
her calendar technologies.

11:10.212 --> 11:13.924
It is a calendar for ladies
called a "Palendar."

11:14.008 --> 11:15.718
You didn't go for "Galendar"?

11:15.801 --> 11:19.054
[straining] What in the shit, Carol!

11:19.763 --> 11:21.390
You see these color-coded tabs?

11:21.473 --> 11:24.435
They are gonna keep me
from messing up another appointment.

11:24.518 --> 11:26.687
Okay, all I care about is Vaginismus.

11:26.770 --> 11:29.899
You don't care about your cousin
Terry's wedding last night?

11:29.982 --> 11:31.483
Cousin Terry got married?

11:31.567 --> 11:33.861
Okay, that's what's
not gonna happen anymore

11:33.944 --> 11:35.946
because of Carol's technologies.

11:36.030 --> 11:38.490
Okay, Vaginismus is two weeks
from tomorrow.

11:38.574 --> 11:40.784
You celebrate the Greek harvest holidays?

11:40.868 --> 11:42.620
That's what I thought it was.

11:42.703 --> 11:43.829
-[laughing] You did?
-I did.

11:43.913 --> 11:45.122
-Come here.
-That's what I said.

11:45.205 --> 11:48.500
[Maria] No, it's the day I must have sex
to keep my vagina open.

11:48.584 --> 11:49.960
This is wrong.

11:50.044 --> 11:52.254
Vaginismus is tonight.

11:52.338 --> 11:54.506
No, this is a yellow tab.

11:54.590 --> 11:57.176
-See, it's in two weeks.
-Only if you're going by fortnights.

11:57.259 --> 11:58.636
I am. That's Carol's technology.

11:58.719 --> 12:00.679
If it's good enough for Abraham Lincoln,

12:00.763 --> 12:04.099
it's good enough for today's
busy, working, modern woman on the go.

12:04.183 --> 12:05.434
Yeah.

12:05.517 --> 12:07.519
Larissa, Vaginismus is tonight!

12:07.603 --> 12:10.105
I need to have sex by midnight.
1:00 at the latest.

12:10.189 --> 12:14.026
There's no way I'm gonna be able
to squeeze it all in!

12:14.610 --> 12:17.112
Is that a metaphor
for your tight, tight vagina?

12:17.196 --> 12:18.238
[exhales deeply] Ooh.

12:18.322 --> 12:20.908
[Maria] <i>Okay,</i>
<i>my life is still a little chaotic.</i>

12:20.991 --> 12:23.452
<i>But I'm not as much of a pushover</i>
<i>as I was in the past.</i>

12:23.535 --> 12:25.704
[Karen] I love you,
you fucking smelly snatch.

12:25.788 --> 12:27.623
Thank you so much, hon.

12:27.706 --> 12:29.583
All right, I got you booked on <i>Kimmel.</i>

12:29.667 --> 12:31.126
-[exclaims] Oh!
-[laughing]

12:31.210 --> 12:35.339
All right, was Bruce able to move the gig
at Flappers so you're tech avails?

12:35.422 --> 12:38.759
I don't know.
I can't seem to get in touch with him.

12:38.842 --> 12:41.011
[reporter] <i>Day 11 of the cruise from hell.</i>

12:41.095 --> 12:43.555
<i>People remain stranded</i>
<i>with limited supplies,</i>

12:43.639 --> 12:47.810
<i>no working plumbing, and no communication</i>
<i>with the outside world.</i>

12:49.687 --> 12:50.980
-[grunting]
-[water splashes]

12:54.149 --> 12:55.609
Barbara?

12:55.693 --> 12:57.820
Please, Barbara, would you open this door?

12:57.903 --> 12:58.988
[lock clicks]

12:59.905 --> 13:01.615
Ramon, I've got to get my charger.

13:01.699 --> 13:04.201
I have to call my number one client,
Maria Bamford.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.578
Captain says no power for incidentals.

13:07.746 --> 13:09.873
Curse this fecal fiasco.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.333
[groans]

13:11.417 --> 13:13.335
Maria, if I died and I went to hell,

13:13.419 --> 13:15.838
I would be sucking the devil's dick
for phone privileges.

13:15.921 --> 13:17.047
You need to fire him now.

13:17.131 --> 13:20.134
He's going through a rough patch
with his marriage.

13:20.217 --> 13:21.427
Oh, boo-fucking-hoo.

13:21.510 --> 13:22.720
You know what? We all have problems.

13:22.803 --> 13:25.806
My son shot up his school.
Did I miss a day of work?

13:25.889 --> 13:27.850
No, I didn't. Okay?

13:28.976 --> 13:30.936
-Fucking fire him! Do it.
-[dialing]

13:31.020 --> 13:33.230
-Do it.
-[line ringing]

13:33.313 --> 13:35.149
-Do it.
-[automated voice] <i>Your call...</i>

13:35.232 --> 13:37.526
Oh, voicemail.
That's a big fucking surprise.

13:37.609 --> 13:39.361
[Bruce] <i>Chantrelle,</i>
<i>how do I record my--</i>

13:39.445 --> 13:42.573
-[beeps]
-Hey, Bruce, it's Maria.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.408
Hey, how you doing?

13:44.491 --> 13:46.201
-Take the shot.
-You're fired.

13:46.285 --> 13:47.578
-[banging]
-Oh, God!

13:47.661 --> 13:48.912
All right, phase two.
Branding.

13:48.996 --> 13:52.041
We're gonna talk movies,
TV, music, fashion,

13:52.124 --> 13:54.835
fragrances, shopping network,
small appliance line.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.879
I represent Adrian fucking Zmed.

13:56.962 --> 13:58.547
He has a product

13:58.630 --> 14:01.550
that will change everything
you ever thought you ever knew

14:01.633 --> 14:02.885
about swimming forever.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.136
[gasping]

14:04.219 --> 14:07.473
-It's called the Zwim Gym.
-[gasping] Oh, my God!

14:07.556 --> 14:09.266
[Karen] It's a holodeck.
You're not pregnant, are you?

14:09.349 --> 14:10.601
If you were, you aren't anymore.

14:10.684 --> 14:13.312
You're welcome.
Or, whatever... my condolences.

14:13.395 --> 14:14.605
Holodeck off.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.273
Pitch me your passion product.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.608
-[sighing] Uh--
-Car blanket?

14:17.691 --> 14:19.943
No, I'm not interested. Pass.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.612
-What are your twin passions?
-Two pugs.

14:21.695 --> 14:22.738
-No.
-Sex and drugs.

14:22.821 --> 14:24.073
-Pass.
-Books, peanut butter.

14:24.156 --> 14:25.407
-Wrong!
-Pugs and books.

14:25.491 --> 14:28.285
It's jogging and bell peppers.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.289
-Wow!
-It's a prototype from the Philippines.

14:32.373 --> 14:34.625
We will be getting in on the ground floor.

14:34.708 --> 14:39.004
How does Maria Bamford's
Pepper Stepper Pepper-bot sound?

14:39.088 --> 14:41.090
-Confusing.
-Exactly.

14:41.173 --> 14:44.051
That is what it's like
to have real representation!

14:44.134 --> 14:45.886
Welcome to the big leagues, baby girl.

14:45.969 --> 14:47.096
-[imitating gunshots]
-[mimics barking]

14:47.179 --> 14:48.764
[both imitating gunshots]

14:50.349 --> 14:52.017
-[mimicking farting]
-[exclaiming]

14:52.101 --> 14:53.394
Get the fuck out of my office.

14:53.477 --> 14:56.772
[Maria] <i>I hate to say it, but firing Bruce</i>
<i>gave me a sense of power.</i>

14:56.855 --> 14:58.857
<i>I felt like anything was possible.</i>

14:58.941 --> 15:01.693
I can't believe you have done all of this.

15:01.777 --> 15:03.862
-I know. I know. [screaming]
-Wow.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.781
I'm so pumped up
from the Karen Grisham meeting.

15:05.864 --> 15:08.367
It's as if-- I feel like,
"I can do anything!"

15:08.450 --> 15:09.451
I love your energy.

15:09.535 --> 15:11.328
-Thank you.
-You're so much fun to be around.

15:11.412 --> 15:13.414
[laughing]

15:13.497 --> 15:15.582
So, how is, uh, the stunt work going?

15:15.666 --> 15:17.084
-Um, it--
-[grunting]

15:17.167 --> 15:19.336
-Oh. Ow!
-[laughing]

15:19.420 --> 15:22.089
-Ow.
-Come on! Two for flinching! [laughing]

15:22.172 --> 15:23.757
-Fiancé.
-Yes.

15:23.841 --> 15:25.926
I feel like I'm getting a little old
for this business.

15:26.009 --> 15:27.052
Oh, no.

15:27.136 --> 15:29.138
No, no, no, no.

15:29.221 --> 15:32.099
You are in awesome shape, okay?
You can do anything.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.559
Oh, my gosh. Look.

15:33.642 --> 15:37.354
<i>Hi. I'm Adrian Zmed</i>
<i>for the Adrian Zmed Zwim Gym.</i>

15:37.438 --> 15:38.689
This is Karen Grisham's client.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.149
Turn it up, turn it up!

15:40.232 --> 15:41.316
-There we go.
-[shrieks]

15:41.400 --> 15:43.527
<i>Got a lot of errands, but you wanna swim?</i>

15:43.610 --> 15:45.154
<i>No time to go to the pool?</i>

15:45.237 --> 15:48.615
<i>Now, you can swim anytime, anywhere!</i>

15:48.699 --> 15:50.284
<i>In the office.</i>

15:50.367 --> 15:51.994
<i>Dropping off the kids.</i>

15:52.077 --> 15:55.205
<i>Getting deposed</i>
<i>for vehicular manslaughter.</i>

15:55.289 --> 15:58.292
<i>Or really get trim and double your Zwim.</i>

<i>And it comes in dog sizes, too!</i>

<i>Zwim Gym!</i>

16:10.012 --> 16:11.763
[Graham] You think that really works?

16:11.847 --> 16:14.683
Well, we're gonna find out
because I just ordered three!

16:14.766 --> 16:15.976
-[laughing]
-All right.

16:16.059 --> 16:19.104
I love swimming so much.
[mimics water sloshing]

16:19.188 --> 16:21.064
-I used to swim all the time.
-Really?

16:21.148 --> 16:22.566
You should totally get back into it,

16:22.649 --> 16:24.985
because Adrian Zmed,
I mean, what is he, 61?

16:25.068 --> 16:28.572
And now he's swum... 23 miles,
all the way to Catalina Island.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.366
You could do that.
There's no way you couldn't not do that.

16:31.450 --> 16:33.160
You start training

16:33.243 --> 16:34.578
and you check the currents,

16:34.661 --> 16:36.205
[in sing-song] and all that jazz.

16:36.288 --> 16:40.459
You could do anything
you set your mind to.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.669
I'm just gonna clean up around here.

16:42.753 --> 16:43.837
You really think so?

16:43.921 --> 16:47.591
You said you liked swimming,
so that's the logical next step.

16:47.674 --> 16:48.842
-That could be fun.
-Yeah.

16:48.926 --> 16:51.261
I did train for that half marathon
that one time.

16:51.345 --> 16:53.931
If you have a wish, you can do anything.

16:54.014 --> 16:56.391
If you have a wish, you put it in a can.

16:56.475 --> 16:58.268
It's called a "God can" because God can.

16:58.352 --> 17:03.315
And I can... help you... train.

17:03.398 --> 17:04.650
You know?

17:04.733 --> 17:08.028
[mimicking Aquaman] Bing, bing...

17:08.111 --> 17:09.988
Aquaman calling in the fishes!

17:10.071 --> 17:11.490
-Oh, yeah. Yes.
-Right?

17:11.573 --> 17:13.367
-[exclaiming]
-[laughing]

17:15.993 --> 17:17.704
[Maria] Okay, first training run.

17:17.788 --> 17:21.208
Fifty miles from home.
Are you ready to Zwim Gym?

17:21.290 --> 17:22.751
Feels kinda weird. It's so heavy.

17:22.834 --> 17:24.920
Yeah, 'cause it's filled with water.
[laughing]

17:25.002 --> 17:28.882
-I'll see you at home, fiancée.
-All right! See you at home, fiancé.

17:28.966 --> 17:30.467
-Pound. Okay.
-[laughing]

17:30.551 --> 17:31.969
Bye!

17:32.052 --> 17:33.387
Yeah!

17:34.471 --> 17:37.015
Oh, God!

17:37.099 --> 17:39.184
Oh, my lover!

17:39.268 --> 17:40.811
[gasping] Oh, God!

17:43.063 --> 17:44.815
You're lucky you're a stuntman.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.733
A blow like that would've
killed any other man,

17:46.817 --> 17:50.237
except for Adrian Zmed.
Thank God you were wearing a Zwim Gym.

17:52.781 --> 17:54.783
When do you think
he'll be able to get back in the water?

17:54.866 --> 17:56.451
We need to get back to training.

17:56.535 --> 17:59.371
I don't wanna get too into the weeds
on the medical mumbo-jumbo,

17:59.454 --> 18:02.416
but his neck is broken
like a motherfucker.

18:02.499 --> 18:04.543
He wants to be in the water, now.

18:04.626 --> 18:08.130
He's swimming
to Catalina Island in 13 days.

18:08.213 --> 18:10.132
He needs to be with the dolphins.

18:10.215 --> 18:12.175
Nature's jesters, sea clowns.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.011
[in sing-song] Laughter heals.

18:14.094 --> 18:16.013
See why I love her? That's it.

18:16.096 --> 18:19.099
It's important for Graham
to take it easy right now, okay?

18:19.182 --> 18:20.309
He's lucky to be alive.

18:20.392 --> 18:21.560
You're killing his dream.

18:21.643 --> 18:23.061
He could be an Olympian.

18:23.145 --> 18:26.273
What about your Hippocratic oath?
Are you a hypocritical Hippocratical?

18:26.356 --> 18:27.608
I thought this was all democratical.

18:27.691 --> 18:29.526
What, now you're making all the decisions?

18:29.610 --> 18:31.695
Are you dictator, Dr. Dictator?
Are you a doctator?

18:31.778 --> 18:33.780
Frytator, Potator, Cheese grater.

18:33.864 --> 18:35.115
I thought your name was Dr. Achter.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.826
Okay, Maria.

18:37.909 --> 18:39.453
Could I speak with you for a second?

18:39.536 --> 18:42.623
Have you ever been diagnosed
with any mental illness?

18:45.542 --> 18:47.544

18:47.628 --> 18:49.755
No, I have... I'm on antidepressants.

18:49.838 --> 18:51.465
I have been since I was 19.

18:51.548 --> 18:54.509
Because I had thoughts of suicide
all the time.

18:54.593 --> 18:56.219
And I still do. But it's under control.

18:56.303 --> 18:57.888
It's not like I think I'm an angel.

18:57.971 --> 19:00.557
When I'm swimming, I'm an angel,
a swim-angel.

19:00.641 --> 19:03.810
That's a swimgel. [chuckling]
I love words.

19:03.894 --> 19:06.438
You're exhibiting
a lot of the symptoms of someone

19:06.521 --> 19:08.857
who might benefit
from being on a mood stabilizer.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.108
[gasping excitedly]

19:10.192 --> 19:12.444
Why don't you prescribe me something?

19:12.527 --> 19:15.072
Because I wanna go
shopping and get some shoes.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.491
-Oh.
-Reeboks. Right?

19:17.574 --> 19:19.701
-Really? Okay.
-Dr. Achter, give me the news,

19:19.785 --> 19:22.037
'cause I have a bad case of loving shoes.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.538
Well, we can do a brain scan,

19:23.622 --> 19:24.915
and we can talk about the results.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.917
-Okay.
-In fact, I'm gonna get another doctor

19:27.000 --> 19:28.377
-to take a look at you, okay?
-Yeah...

19:28.460 --> 19:29.544
-Doctor...
-Because...

19:29.628 --> 19:32.172
Look over there. Ah! I'm going!

[Maria] Yeah?

19:46.978 --> 19:48.021
-[grunting]
-Okay.

19:48.105 --> 19:49.773
-That remind you of anything?
-Yes.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.109
-This is your vagina.
-Okay. Yeah.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.236
-It's too tight. Can't fit it in.
-I got it.

19:55.278 --> 19:57.364
So, this is the vag-bar, huh?

19:57.447 --> 20:01.618
Yeah, this is
where I traditionally hold Vaginismus.

20:01.702 --> 20:03.662
And I always sit at this bar.

20:03.745 --> 20:05.539
I always order a Diet Coke and cran

20:05.622 --> 20:07.416
with seven maraschino cherries.

20:07.499 --> 20:09.668
And then, I just wait...

20:09.751 --> 20:11.378
-for the universe...
-Just happens?

20:11.461 --> 20:12.462
to bring me a miracle.

20:12.546 --> 20:14.339
-Smart thinking.
-[Bartender] Here you go, Maria.

20:14.423 --> 20:16.842

with seven maraschino cherries.

20:16.925 --> 20:19.511
-Thank you so much, Frank.
-Yeah, thank you so much.

20:19.594 --> 20:21.304
-[whispering] He's pretty cute, Maria.
-Yeah.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.765
Not my type, but what about for you?

20:23.849 --> 20:27.394
Been there, done that.
It was Vaginismus... 2011.

20:27.477 --> 20:30.313
-I just like to let the evening unfold.
-Mmm-hmm.

20:30.397 --> 20:33.316
And trust that the universe will just...

20:33.400 --> 20:35.235
spit out the right guy at the right time.

20:35.318 --> 20:38.488
And, if that does not happen,
there is always...

20:41.241 --> 20:42.576
-Maria.
-Mmm-hmm.

20:42.659 --> 20:44.745
I know that you're going through
some shit right now.

20:44.828 --> 20:46.997
I want you to know I'm here for you.
You know that?

20:47.080 --> 20:48.582
-I know.
-So just go out there.

20:48.665 --> 20:49.666
-Have fun.
-Okay.

20:49.750 --> 20:52.377
If anybody comes at you
with that butt stuff,

20:52.461 --> 20:54.504
-send them to me, okay?
-You got that right.

20:54.588 --> 20:56.298
-Okay. Thanks, sister.
-Straight to you.

20:56.381 --> 20:58.383
I'm gonna go make someone
a hero out there.

20:58.467 --> 21:00.552
Okay, okay.

21:05.182 --> 21:06.433
Oh, God. Okay.

-Yeah.

Yeah, Maria Bamford. So you remember me?

21:17.319 --> 21:18.445
-Yeah. Hmm.
-Okay.

21:18.528 --> 21:22.115
God, I am so sorry. It was an accident.

21:22.199 --> 21:25.911
I was so excited
and I just kind of flung... I'm so sorry.

21:25.994 --> 21:27.496
You think you're the only white woman

21:27.579 --> 21:28.997
who's thrown a hot cup of coffee at me?

21:29.998 --> 21:33.502
Let's just say there's a new girl
on the lot. Infer what you want.

21:34.294 --> 21:37.923
Can I, in any way, make it up to you
by buying you a drink?

21:38.006 --> 21:39.883
-You're gonna throw it at me?
-No.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.760

21:52.479 --> 21:53.688
That is my drink.

21:53.772 --> 21:56.107
-That's crazy. [laughing]
-Wow.

21:59.319 --> 22:00.445
-I was rude to you.
-Right.

22:00.529 --> 22:02.572
Why don't you go ahead and say

22:02.656 --> 22:04.574
the rudest thing you can think of to me.

22:04.658 --> 22:05.826
All right. Your hair...

22:06.451 --> 22:08.078
is too shiny and beautiful.

22:08.161 --> 22:09.538
[both chuckling]

22:09.621 --> 22:11.498
-Okay. Something real.
-Okay, real.

Your jeans make your bum look too nice.

-Okay, now that's...

22:15.669 --> 22:17.671
Well, you're looking pretty good yourself.

Thank you.
I work hard to keep the weight off.

-Okay.

22:22.175 --> 22:24.803
They used to call me, uh, "Fat Dick."

Aw. Well, that must've hurt.

[Maria] Hmm.

22:36.147 --> 22:38.108
get out of here
and go hang out at my place?

22:38.191 --> 22:41.403
And... we could watch a movie
or canoodle, you know.

22:41.486 --> 22:43.363
That sounds nice.

22:44.197 --> 22:45.240
[chuckles softly]

22:46.616 --> 22:50.370
I had a good time tonight.
Can I... call you?

Well, wait, you don't have to leave.
You can stay.

22:54.082 --> 22:56.167
You can have sex with me tonight.

22:56.251 --> 22:59.254
I like you. I don't wanna have sex
the first night we hang out.

[scoffing] Come on!
You're a guy. Come on.

23:03.341 --> 23:08.263
I really need to have sex
with you... tonight.

23:08.346 --> 23:10.140
You know, I'm feeling uncomfortable.

23:10.223 --> 23:12.434
You shouldn't. You should feel flattered.

23:12.517 --> 23:14.853
-Right.
-I had a sure thing at the bar,

23:14.936 --> 23:16.479
but I chose you.

23:16.605 --> 23:18.940
So I'm only here 'cause you needed some D.

23:19.024 --> 23:22.569
Yeah, and I wanted to make it up to you
because of scalding you on the lot.

23:22.652 --> 23:25.322
You realize this is insulting
to me right now?

23:25.405 --> 23:27.490

-Okay.

my painful rock box, okay?
