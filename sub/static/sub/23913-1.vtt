<i>This call is from
an inmate at a federal prison.</i>

00:48.966 --> 00:52.140
<i>This call is being recorded
and is subject to monitoring.</i>

00:52.219 --> 00:54.313
<i>To accept, dial five now.</i>

00:55.430 --> 00:58.525
<i>Respect for the game is honor.
Where if you sign on to the army</i>

00:58.600 --> 01:01.604
<i>to kill other people and you do it,
you come home and get a medal.</i>

01:02.020 --> 01:03.488
<i>But killing in another game,</i>

01:03.564 --> 01:04.736
<i>you'll go to jail for it.</i>

01:04.815 --> 01:06.158
<i>It's honorable when it's at war,</i>

01:06.233 --> 01:08.406
<i>but it's not honorable
when there's a war in the street.</i>

01:08.485 --> 01:11.455
<i>Just like snitching. Like, if you a cop
and you snitch, that's honorable.</i>

01:11.530 --> 01:13.373
<i>But if you're a criminal and you snitch,</i>

01:13.448 --> 01:15.041
<i>now you're going
against what you signed onto.</i>

01:15.117 --> 01:17.211
<i>Now you trying to put somebody
in jail instead of yourself,</i>

01:17.286 --> 01:19.209
<i>that you was getting money with;
no honor in that.</i>

01:19.413 --> 01:22.713
<i>So whether it's money, women, cars:
honor comes first.</i>

<i>Please be advised that pedestrians

02:20.557 --> 02:22.104
<i>I came from a block in Harlem.</i>

02:22.643 --> 02:25.396
<i>Whether you played basketball
or chose the drug game,</i>

02:25.479 --> 02:27.777
<i>your mentality was death before dishonor.</i>

02:28.982 --> 02:30.404
<i>We were governed by our own laws.</i>

02:31.068 --> 02:32.615
<i>We had morals and principles.</i>

02:32.986 --> 02:34.238
<i>And your word meant everything.</i>

02:34.821 --> 02:37.950
<i>And the consequence of any violation
of the rules of this game...</i>

02:38.408 --> 02:39.455
<i>was you could get killed.</i>

02:57.886 --> 02:59.433
<i>And the guys that played the game right,</i>

03:01.264 --> 03:02.857
<i>they were considered the good guys.</i>

03:06.937 --> 03:10.987
<i>But in this game,
the good guys have to do bad things.</i>

04:16.505 --> 04:17.632
<i>I wasn't from the block.</i>

04:18.091 --> 04:20.514
<i>I was actually from the eastside,
Spanish Harlem.</i>

04:20.969 --> 04:23.438
<i>My man Black, who I knew
from school, brought me around.</i>

04:23.513 --> 04:25.186
<i>And the older dudes liked my style.</i>

04:26.016 --> 04:27.768
Yo, Kite, real talk?

04:28.185 --> 04:30.779
I like the nigga, man.
His style's impeccable, man.

04:30.854 --> 04:34.358
<i>They liked me because I was
a younger dude, but I had big-boy toys.</i>

04:34.691 --> 04:36.659
<i>And I conducted myself like a boss.</i>

04:38.153 --> 04:39.370
<i>The older dudes ran the block.</i>

04:39.863 --> 04:41.206
<i>They were cut from a different cloth.</i>

04:41.281 --> 04:42.828
<i>They took pride in being men.</i>

04:43.074 --> 04:44.621
<i>And the dude that I looked up to,</i>

04:44.785 --> 04:46.628
<i>the dude that actually
hit me with some work,</i>

04:47.078 --> 04:48.000
<i>that was Primo.</i>

04:48.747 --> 04:49.919
<i>Primo was gangster.</i>

04:50.207 --> 04:53.381
<i>He used to be a stick-up kid,
but now he had a plug with the Italians.</i>

04:53.460 --> 04:54.962
<i>And he had all the drugs,</i>

04:55.212 --> 04:56.555
<i>always had all the jewelry.</i>

04:57.798 --> 05:00.642
<i>And would never send somebody to do
something that he wouldn't do himself.</i>

05:07.974 --> 05:10.147
<i>Primo's crew was feared
throughout the whole city.</i>

05:10.227 --> 05:13.231
<i>And because I was down with him, it meant
I could hustle anywhere in Harlem.</i>

05:16.691 --> 05:17.658
...at the end of the day

05:17.734 --> 05:19.828
you ain't got to worry
about none of these things, man.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.496
We got all that on lock.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.994
Nigga ain't gonna violate nothing on us.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.542
Like, this whole shit is us.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.536
<i>Primds right-hand man was Kite.</i>

05:28.245 --> 05:29.246
<i>They were like brothers.</i>

05:29.830 --> 05:30.831
<i>He was a funny dude.</i>

05:30.914 --> 05:32.837
<i>He had this way
of always trying to test you.</i>

05:32.916 --> 05:34.918
You busting your gun
and all that, a little?

05:35.001 --> 05:37.095
Nah, I'm busting the BBS' right here,
that's all.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.715
- That's cool, you bust your gun...
- I <i>paid</i> him no <i>mind.</i>

05:40.257 --> 05:41.884
<i>But Black, he wasn't having it.</i>

05:41.967 --> 05:43.514
- Go ahead.
- It's not like that, though.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.595
Good, young niggas, man.
You know what I mean?

05:45.679 --> 05:47.181
- It's live out here?
- It's real live.

05:47.264 --> 05:48.686
Bustin' BBS. That's what I'm doing.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.309
Live on a Sunday night.

05:51.268 --> 05:53.396
<i>I didn't give a fuck
about none of that tough-guy shit.</i>

05:53.770 --> 05:55.613
<i>I truly thought it was unnecessary.</i>

05:56.022 --> 05:57.865
<i>A fair one was always okay with me.</i>

05:58.358 --> 06:00.156
<i>I just wanted to get money and stay fly.</i>

06:00.235 --> 06:02.158
I just wanna know,
what's the next car to get?

06:02.237 --> 06:03.784
That's what I need to know.
What you getting?

06:04.281 --> 06:06.750
- That's what I need to know.
- Man, I'm looking at that 850.

06:06.825 --> 06:09.874
This nigga keep driving the van, like,
family car. I don't know what that's for.

06:09.953 --> 06:13.298
- I drive MVPs, B.
- This nigga about MVPs, B.

06:14.082 --> 06:17.382
Child seats in there, you know?
You know what I'm saying?

06:17.627 --> 06:20.847
- Most valuable player car.
- He put BBS' on a van.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.799
I don't know what's wrong with this nigga.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.349
<i>Kite really did have the MPV.</i>

06:26.803 --> 06:28.646
<i>He had the nerve to put rims on it.</i>

06:28.805 --> 06:30.398
<i>But when that family van pulled up,</i>

06:30.765 --> 06:31.732
<i>The block would clear out.</i>

06:32.142 --> 06:34.270
<i>'Cause you never knew
when he was gonna come out spraying.</i>

06:53.622 --> 06:55.465
<i>These guys were legends in the street.</i>

06:56.082 --> 06:57.834
<i>And I was taught the game
directly from them.</i>

06:58.418 --> 07:01.718
So you gonna last, stay low, get money.

07:02.672 --> 07:05.016
<i>Primo was my OG.
He taught me the game.</i>

07:05.425 --> 07:06.722
<i>He was a killer for hire,</i>

07:06.801 --> 07:08.769
<i>but always taught me
to stay away from the violence.</i>

07:09.179 --> 07:11.102
...but you gotta keep
the murders, the bodies,

07:11.389 --> 07:13.016
gotta keep that shit to a minimum.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.066
To a minimum?

07:14.142 --> 07:16.065
'Cause you can't get money
with them bodies on you.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.316
- Know what I mean?
- No bodies?

07:17.687 --> 07:19.940
<i>Primo and I never talked about
no dumb shit.</i>

07:20.523 --> 07:21.740
<i>He was always schooling me.</i>

07:21.816 --> 07:23.693
<i>Teaching me how to be a better man.</i>

07:24.361 --> 07:26.489
<i>To stay focused. Stay prepared.</i>

07:27.030 --> 07:28.031
<i>He hated when I smoked.</i>

07:28.114 --> 07:30.162
Lay off the Buddha, man,
you know what I mean?

07:30.825 --> 07:32.919
No more chunky-black for a while, B.

07:33.536 --> 07:36.164
- Get back in the gym. Get our shit up.
- Primo was my connect.

07:36.623 --> 07:39.342
<i>He would hit me with the work,
and I would hit my young niggas.</i>

07:39.751 --> 07:41.094
<i>But they was getting way too wild,</i>

07:41.169 --> 07:43.012
<i>-an Primo didn't trust it.
-...niggas is</i> young.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.799
I don't know how honorable
them niggas is, though, B.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.055
You know, any nigga on our team,
you already know.

07:48.635 --> 07:49.682
We honorable, B.

07:49.761 --> 07:51.684
You know, we gonna go down,
we gonna stand up.

07:51.763 --> 07:53.857
I can't say that
for them young niggas, you dig?

07:54.683 --> 07:57.311
- I'm getting money, I got cars.
- The young niggas was getting money.

07:57.852 --> 08:00.230
<i>But they was starting to have issues
that involve gun-play.</i>

08:00.480 --> 08:03.233
<i>And that's not what I did.
And I didn't know what to tell him.</i>

08:03.692 --> 08:05.990
They'll bust they gun,
but I don't know after that.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.572
They wolves, you understand?
They want they own, I'm not gonna lie.

08:08.780 --> 08:09.747
Line 'em up, man.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.662
Line 'em up, man.

08:11.741 --> 08:12.833
That's not what I'm saying.

08:12.909 --> 08:15.662
You know, they'll do anything for me.
I'm just saying.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.292
Get some structure out here, man.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.755
A lot of these kids in disarray.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.504
Matter fact, they have problems,
just come see me, B.

08:23.586 --> 08:24.838
Fucking cut, you know.

08:25.213 --> 08:26.339
Let him do what he do.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.391
You do what you do;
keep getting money, all right?

08:28.466 --> 08:31.470
- You get that money. Line 'em up for you.
- Yeah. Red pulse and all that.

08:31.553 --> 08:35.433
<i>At the end of the day, he taught me you
don't have to be feared to be respected.</i>

08:35.765 --> 08:38.063
<i>Just play the game with honor
and be thorough.</i>

08:38.143 --> 08:39.736
<i>A no-nonsense kinda nigga.</i>

08:40.061 --> 08:42.860
<i>But if anybody disrespected you,
no matter who it was,</i>

08:43.273 --> 08:45.025
<i>you should always be prepared
to use your gun.</i>

08:54.451 --> 08:56.294
<i>There was nothing better
than the girls from Harlem.</i>

08:56.369 --> 08:57.996
<i>They were called the major coins.</i>

08:58.079 --> 09:00.332
<i>And the dudes in the game
loved spending money on them.</i>

09:00.415 --> 09:01.541
<i>It was called "tricking."</i>

09:01.624 --> 09:04.343
<i>If you got with any one of them,
that meant you was doing it.</i>

09:04.419 --> 09:05.386
<i>It was like a trophy.</i>

09:06.046 --> 09:09.676
<i>These women respected the game
just as much as the men, if not more.</i>

09:09.758 --> 09:12.352
<i>And they knew how to get their own money.
They stayed fly.</i>

09:12.802 --> 09:13.974
<i>They thought like bosses,</i>

09:14.054 --> 09:15.772
<i>so they were only attracted to bosses.</i>

09:15.847 --> 09:20.353
<i>They could make</i> a <i>couple grand
just walking from 125th to 145th, any day.</i>

09:20.435 --> 09:22.984
<i>'Cause any dude outside
would throw them a couple of dollars.</i>

09:23.313 --> 09:24.690
<i>And try to throw them they A-game.</i>

09:27.108 --> 09:29.327
I've been thinking about you
and some other shit, so...

09:31.196 --> 09:32.789
You look real good tonight too.

09:32.864 --> 09:34.992
I'm telling you,
you killing that mink jacket.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.494
- All right?
- Don't fuck with me.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.122
<i>Primo used to talk to Erika.</i>

09:40.205 --> 09:41.297
<i>She was fine.</i>

09:41.748 --> 09:44.251
<i>Don't even think about talking to her
unless you had car money.</i>

09:44.334 --> 09:47.258
I wanna fuck with you, but I need
to know if you're an honorable chick.

09:49.672 --> 09:50.594
What you think?

09:51.341 --> 09:52.467
You gon' ride with me?

09:53.176 --> 09:54.098
Like...

09:54.177 --> 09:57.021
- You gonna hold my gun when it's time?
- You shouldn't have to ask that question.

09:57.388 --> 09:58.935
I mean, it's something I have to ask,

09:59.015 --> 10:01.939
'cause I don't wanna just put
something on you that you ain't ready for.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.020
All right, well, you get to ask
that question once.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.026
I'll answer it once.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.235
- Okay.
- The answer is yes.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.660
You said that like a gangster too,
I like that.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.576
At the end of the day,
you gonna honor up?

10:14.864 --> 10:16.411
Hon0r-- honor up?

10:16.866 --> 10:19.585
Yeah, if you're an honorable person,
you say, "honor up" back.

10:20.161 --> 10:22.129
- Honor up.
- Okay, I like that.

10:22.205 --> 10:23.252
I like that.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.708
Good girl. Yeah I like that.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.590
- Watch your hands.
- Oh, I'm sorry...

10:28.670 --> 10:30.092
<i>I smooched Spanish Rocky.</i>

10:30.338 --> 10:31.965
<i>She liked me 'cause I was cocky.</i>

10:32.340 --> 10:34.763
<i>Oh my God, I always had a thing
for Spanish girls.</i>

10:34.843 --> 10:37.187
I knew you only came around
'cause you wanted to see me.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.310
Who's saying that?

10:39.556 --> 10:41.854
I was thinking it was the car,
but I know it's me.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.935
- You know? I know you think I'm cute.
- Mm-hmm.

10:44.018 --> 10:45.361
<i>Tricking wasn't really my thing.</i>

10:45.436 --> 10:48.565
<i>But when I met her, I knew I was gonna buy
her a couple of cars.</i>

10:48.648 --> 10:50.366
<i>She was gonna be wifey for Iifey.</i>

10:50.441 --> 10:53.786
I'm not trick or nothing, but I feel like
I need to buy you a couple cars.

10:53.862 --> 10:54.909
I'm not gonna lie.

10:55.238 --> 10:57.491
- This is a good one to start with.
- Yeah.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.076
<i>I sold crack.</i>

11:02.537 --> 11:04.756
<i>And my clientele was called crackheads.</i>

11:18.428 --> 11:21.557
When I get high, it's like,
I feel my heart pumping.

11:22.432 --> 11:25.481
Put the crack in the pipe,
start smoking the crack.

11:25.560 --> 11:28.313
Like, ten minutes later
you out in space like this...

11:30.148 --> 11:34.028
And you start looking around, and you feel
this adrenaline rush off the crack,

11:34.110 --> 11:37.364
so you start moving this way,
and you start moving that way.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.825
Then you just start moving
all over the place.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.920
You start thinking about,
"Okay, is this guy looking at me?"

11:43.995 --> 11:46.794
Or, "Is this person looking at me?"
Like, you wanna be paranoid.

11:48.082 --> 11:52.007
Yeah, till you come down
and start thinking about it later on

11:52.086 --> 11:55.431
and what time you might wanna
run around again like a madman.

11:56.591 --> 11:59.970
You run and hide in a hallway,
or you go to your apartment.

12:00.053 --> 12:04.149
Or you're, like, looking for a rooftop
where nobody's at

12:04.224 --> 12:06.647
where there is nobody nowhere around.

12:09.020 --> 12:12.445
I smoke, I get high,
and I start having the adrenaline rush.

12:12.523 --> 12:15.367
Start ripping off all my clothes
and wait till I come down.

12:15.693 --> 12:18.537
That'd be the first one.
Then the second one I do the same thing.

12:18.613 --> 12:20.957
Then the third one I just might look there

12:21.032 --> 12:23.285
and be butt-ass naked
and just asking myself,

12:23.368 --> 12:24.995
"Do you really want another one?"

12:30.708 --> 12:32.210
<i>I sold straight coke as well.</i>

12:32.835 --> 12:34.883
<i>The old-timers used to smoke coolies.</i>

12:42.637 --> 12:44.105
<i>Back in '87, '88,</i>

12:44.264 --> 12:47.188
<i>me and my peeps used to go
to the heights, cop a gram or two,</i>

12:47.850 --> 12:49.227
<i>and shoot down to the top.</i>

12:49.644 --> 12:51.066
Rooftop, that is.

12:51.396 --> 12:54.525
Listen to Brucey-B, Kid Capri,
Starchild do they thing.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.404
Then we shoot up in the bathroom.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.327
You could either sniff the coke

12:58.403 --> 12:59.746
or roll it up in a cigarette.

13:00.071 --> 13:02.415
Who would even imagine
rolling up coke it a cigarette.

13:02.824 --> 13:06.044
Nicotine, rat poison, all that shit,
then you gonna go put coke in it.

13:06.703 --> 13:07.920
It was a thing to do.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.921
Basically you'd bust down
half the cigarette, put the coke in it,

13:12.250 --> 13:14.878
twist it around, you take that filter out.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.388
That's what a filter does:
it filters shit.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.091
Put a little piece of cardboard
in the back.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.601
Roast it. Get your mind right.

13:23.261 --> 13:24.729
And that's what they call a coolie.

13:25.555 --> 13:28.274
It was a good look, it was casual,
it wasn't no crackhead shit.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.853
Never had me running
around chasing after nothing.

13:31.352 --> 13:32.274
You dig?

13:32.645 --> 13:34.238
It was real easy like fine wine.

13:47.410 --> 13:48.502
<i>This was my young crew.</i>

13:48.578 --> 13:50.171
<i>They were like America's worst nightmare.</i>

13:50.413 --> 13:52.791
<i>Fresh, intelligent, getting money.</i>

13:53.374 --> 13:54.626
<i>And extremely violent.</i>

13:55.293 --> 13:56.636
<i>I was like their OG.</i>

13:56.836 --> 13:59.510
<i>I had the red Porsche
with the red BBS rims.</i>

13:59.964 --> 14:01.841
<i>I just to come around stunting.</i>

14:01.924 --> 14:04.347
<i>They loved it.
It was like motivation for 'em.</i>

14:04.427 --> 14:05.929
I don't really give a fuck about cars.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.435
All I really give a fuck about
is the color, you know?

14:08.765 --> 14:09.982
I buy the car to match.

14:10.516 --> 14:13.520
Sometime you be wylin, man.
You gonna get the cleaners in the car.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.398
<i>They were thorough,
but they was just too young and wild.</i>

14:16.939 --> 14:19.033
You gotta stay away from the violence
as much as possible.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.824
If it happens, it happens.
We know what to do.

14:21.903 --> 14:22.699
Right.

14:22.779 --> 14:25.623
Just be calm, just be cool.
Violence is a means to an end.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.117
When we first got here,
they were selling dime bottles.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.331
Now it's fucking trays.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.003
Then it's gonna be two for fives.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.623
What, we gonna break our back,
running on a treadmill?

14:33.956 --> 14:36.584
We gotta change what we selling because
everybody's selling the same thing.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.836
- Right.
- We a family and we gotta stick together.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.638
And we can never have beef
between each other.

14:40.713 --> 14:41.839
Boss, you right.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.259
<i>We just didn't think everyone else
was hustling right.</i>

14:44.342 --> 14:46.060
<i>We just used to laugh at niggas.</i>

14:46.386 --> 14:48.730
<i>I would advise them,
keep 'em one step ahead of the game.</i>

14:51.349 --> 14:53.477
<i>This is Dee. He did everything high.</i>

14:53.976 --> 14:55.068
<i>But he handled his business.</i>

14:55.812 --> 14:57.314
<i>I fucked with him
because he was cheap.</i>

14:57.397 --> 14:58.569
You gotta spend some money.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.317
You understand what I'm saying?

15:00.400 --> 15:01.652
Nigga, you acting Jewish, man.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.736
Nigga, you taking those Rothstein shits.

15:03.820 --> 15:06.664
Spend no money, don't bust his gun,
he don't do nothing.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.412
I'm tired of you.

15:08.491 --> 15:11.040
<i>And JR, he was like my little brother.</i>

15:11.494 --> 15:12.837
<i>He was a stand up guy,</i>

15:13.121 --> 15:14.589
<i>And obsessed with me getting a connect.</i>

15:14.664 --> 15:17.668
What's downtown got on some
Brooklyn niggas, you know what I'm saying?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.547
She wasn't about nothing, man.

15:20.253 --> 15:23.757
Anyway, if you get the connect, man,
could lock this whole shit down, man.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.683
I know once you get that connect, man.

15:26.342 --> 15:29.061
Shit gonna be crazy, I'm telling you, man.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.014
Y'all just gotta keep it cool, that's all.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.565
That's all we gotta do; get this money.
And also--

15:33.641 --> 15:35.985
They're better position than us.
That's why you saying keep cool.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.277
It's all I've been thinking about.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.902
<i>He was nice in ball,
but he chose the drug game.</i>

15:40.690 --> 15:43.239
<i>And he had a fine-ass sister
that was nice in ball too.</i>

15:44.152 --> 15:45.825
<i>But she was off limits out of respect.</i>

15:51.701 --> 15:53.703
<i>Mike? Mike was the wildcard.</i>

15:54.370 --> 15:55.292
<i>A real hothead.</i>

15:55.705 --> 15:56.627
<i>He had issues.</i>

15:56.873 --> 15:58.420
<i>So I sent him to talk to Primo.</i>

15:58.499 --> 16:00.593
<i>But where Primo used to talk
to me like a boss,</i>

16:00.668 --> 16:02.295
<i>he talked to Mike like a killer.</i>

16:02.378 --> 16:04.096
You seen that nigga Rado around, man?

16:04.172 --> 16:05.719
Nigga owe me a couple dollars, man.

16:06.048 --> 16:08.847
- Hold on. Rado owe you some money?
- Yeah.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.478
Type of bubblegum shit is that, my nigga?

16:11.929 --> 16:12.930
Yo, listen, my nigga.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.228
Real talk.

16:14.390 --> 16:17.109
He some Pootie Tang, pussy, gump-ass. You?

16:18.060 --> 16:19.653
You know, you a killa in these streets.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.823
How you let a nigga like that
owe you, my nigga?

16:21.981 --> 16:25.201
How you let a dude like that violate?
You known as a killer on these streets.

16:25.276 --> 16:26.573
These blocks you own,

16:26.819 --> 16:28.321
they hear some shit like that?

16:29.071 --> 16:30.618
- It's over, B.
- Right.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.825
Can't have that bubblegum shit, my nigga.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.627
Nigga don't play them ghetto games.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.579
If you plan on staying on top...

16:38.164 --> 16:39.916
can't let nobody violate.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.380
Nobody violate.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.878
These the streets of Harlem.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.214
<i>If you give someone some work,</i>

16:46.297 --> 16:47.219
<i>they have to pay.</i>

16:47.423 --> 16:50.142
<i>If they don't,
no one you work with will respect you.</i>

16:50.384 --> 16:51.260
<i>They'll think you're soft.</i>

16:51.344 --> 16:52.846
<i>And they won't pay you either.</i>

16:52.929 --> 16:55.273
<i>And if someone owes you money
and they're coming around,</i>

16:55.348 --> 16:57.442
<i>flagrantly spending,
buying shit and gambling?</i>

16:57.934 --> 16:58.856
<i>That's a violation.</i>

16:58.935 --> 17:00.937
<i>And that person must be made an example.</i>

17:01.437 --> 17:02.484
<i>At least on my block.</i>

17:03.105 --> 17:05.233
<i>This dude Rado owed Mike some money.</i>

17:05.441 --> 17:06.784
<i>And instead of paying Mike,</i>

17:07.193 --> 17:10.492
<i>he decides to buy a car and do some
heavy gambling around the block.</i>

17:11.239 --> 17:13.492
<i>Dee was at the gambling spot
and gave Mike a call.</i>

17:14.909 --> 17:16.455
<i>Mike told Dee to keep him there.</i>

17:37.056 --> 17:39.275
Heard you shook niggas
at the G Spot the other day.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.853
Oh, you heard that?
Cracked them niggas, man.

17:42.186 --> 17:43.358
Broke them niggas, man.

17:43.437 --> 17:45.064
There's some of that here
and then some.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.694
- Oh, yeah?
- Facts.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.651
That shit, I like to hear.
I heard you.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.160
Deal the cards, man.

17:50.945 --> 17:53.539
None of that funny trick dealing
shit you be on either, man.

17:53.614 --> 17:55.366
Man, y'all be tripping.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.497
Oh, man!

17:58.452 --> 17:59.999
<i>Q“, go my mgga fight here.</i>

18:00.162 --> 18:02.130
Y'all didn't invite me to the game, huh?

18:02.206 --> 18:03.128
<i>What up. bov?</i>

18:03.374 --> 18:05.126
- What's going on?
-'Sup, nigga.

18:05.501 --> 18:06.423
Gentlemen.

18:07.712 --> 18:09.714
You don't mind if I do, right? Nah.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.761
You don't mind, do you?

18:11.841 --> 18:12.842
You, my nigga?

18:17.138 --> 18:18.355
So what's the game?

18:18.889 --> 18:19.890
A little blackjack.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.233
Blackjack?

18:21.684 --> 18:22.776
Twenty-one, huh?

18:23.769 --> 18:24.691
This is cool.

18:25.896 --> 18:26.818
Rado.

18:27.773 --> 18:28.740
What's going on?

18:29.025 --> 18:29.947
Mm.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.656
That's a lot of money over there.

18:31.736 --> 18:33.329
Mr. Moneyman right here.

18:33.404 --> 18:36.328
Cleaned them up at the dice game
the other day. That's that money.

18:36.407 --> 18:38.956
Oh, is that so?
Cleaned up at the G Spot?

18:39.035 --> 18:39.957
Mm-hmm.

18:40.453 --> 18:43.753
Wouldn't happen to be some of
that money you owe me, right?

18:49.337 --> 18:50.259
Hm?

18:51.422 --> 18:53.641
No? What, cat got your tongue, nigga?

18:54.050 --> 18:56.599
- Mm, ain't got shit to say, man.
- Typical.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.721
Yeah, all right. It's cool.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.690
This what we're gonna do, see;
Since I'm a gentleman...

19:02.683 --> 19:03.900
we're gonna play a gentleman's game.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.066
Right? Since you played me,

19:07.313 --> 19:09.486
I'ma play you back for the money
that you owe me.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.196
Sounds fair.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.283
- Sounds fair to me.
- Sounds very fair.

19:15.780 --> 19:16.952
So let's play our own game.

19:17.698 --> 19:20.872
Now, what we gonna play is
a game called high card. Heard of it?

19:21.994 --> 19:22.836
You ever played that?

19:22.912 --> 19:24.038
- Yeah--
- You look confused. Okay.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.213
It's real simple.

19:25.539 --> 19:27.132
Easy. Check.

19:27.208 --> 19:28.425
You deal me a card.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.215
You deal yourself a card.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.922
Whoever has the high card is the winner,

19:33.005 --> 19:37.636
and whoever has the lower card
is".al0seL

19:38.427 --> 19:39.349
Pretty simple.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.601
- Sounds simple to me.
- Mm-hmm. Pretty simple.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.268
So let's, uh... shall we?

19:45.601 --> 19:46.523
Deal, nigga.

19:46.811 --> 19:47.937
Deal the cards, brother.

19:48.938 --> 19:51.282
Rado! Deal the cards, Rado!

19:57.780 --> 19:58.702
Flip.

20:00.658 --> 20:05.459
Know how many possibilities there is for
a five, for me to have higher than a five?

20:06.247 --> 20:07.043
Huh?

20:07.123 --> 20:09.967
But you know what,
maybe God on your side tonight, right?

20:10.876 --> 20:11.877
Flip me over, nigga.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.809
Oh, ain't this about a bitch?

20:21.220 --> 20:23.473
Goddamn it, Rado!

20:24.473 --> 20:28.319
Rado, Rado, Rado, now we

20:29.145 --> 20:30.442
Look at what you done did, nigga.

20:30.521 --> 20:32.319
You just got your fucking man killed.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.083
We gonna try this
motherfucker again, right?

20:52.168 --> 20:53.420
We gonna play this over again.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.513
I'm giving you a lot of
fucking chances, Rado.

20:57.339 --> 20:58.261
Flip the cards.

21:00.843 --> 21:01.765
Flip up.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.600
Look at this, this nigga's scared now.
He nervous.

21:08.142 --> 21:10.236
You nervous?
I know you nervous, nigga.

21:11.061 --> 21:11.983
Go ahead, flip up.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.328
The fuck, you shaking, nigga.

21:24.241 --> 21:27.040
Look at this nigga, got the face
like a nigga just smack him.

21:27.536 --> 21:28.332
Nigga's crazy.

21:28.412 --> 21:31.632
Oh he owes niggas money--
Flip the fucking card, nigga!

21:35.920 --> 21:39.641
Aw, goddamn it, a two?

21:40.508 --> 21:41.725
Motherfucking deuce, man.

21:43.552 --> 21:44.474
Shit!

21:45.262 --> 21:47.731
Rado this calm as a motherfucker,
ain't he?

21:48.390 --> 21:50.108
Flip me over, nigga. Flip-- flip me over.

21:58.234 --> 21:59.656
Now we in a sticky one, nigga.

21:59.735 --> 22:00.702
We're in a sticky one.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.748
How're we gonna do this one?
How we gonna do this one?

22:03.948 --> 22:06.622
Hm? Know what?
Since I'm a gentleman...

22:07.910 --> 22:09.127
you wanna take a drink?

22:11.664 --> 22:12.586
Oh, no?

22:12.832 --> 22:14.004
I like him. He's a gangster.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.711
<i>Dee and Mike did
what they felt they had to do.</i>

22:17.253 --> 22:19.347
<i>In their eyes they had no choice.</i>

22:23.592 --> 22:26.220
<i>But now, it was too hot
for them to hustle uptown.</i>

22:27.179 --> 22:29.432
<i>So they decided to go downtown
to the lower eastside.</i>

22:29.932 --> 22:31.559
<i>And holler at their man, Blackface.</i>

22:55.457 --> 22:58.631
<i>If you were from the lower eastside,
you called it Loisaidas.</i>

23:00.296 --> 23:02.139
<i>It was basically Harlem of downtown.</i>

23:02.464 --> 23:03.932
<i>With a lot more Spanish people.</i>

23:08.846 --> 23:12.350
<i>And the morals and principles of the game
were exactly the same down there.</i>

23:13.475 --> 23:14.977
I'm pissed the fuck off, man.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.487
Just had to twist
a nigga's shit uptown, man.

23:17.563 --> 23:18.610
This nigga owed me money,

23:18.689 --> 23:21.033
walked in the spot,
all type of big chains on,

23:21.108 --> 23:22.860
nigga smirking at me and all that, man.

23:23.277 --> 23:24.620
What's wrong
with these dumb niggas, man?

23:24.695 --> 23:26.823
They don't play the game how
it's supposed to be played.

23:27.197 --> 23:30.326
Fuck it, I might as well do that
because fuck, I can't hustle if I don't.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.503
You know?
You know you'd a did the same shit.

23:32.786 --> 23:33.708
I heard you.

23:34.038 --> 23:35.540
But, now what?

23:35.998 --> 23:39.002
You just got that block clicking,
that money was coming.

23:39.168 --> 23:41.512
Now you can't go back there
for a year or so.

23:41.587 --> 23:42.509
Kna' mean?

23:42.630 --> 23:45.349
Now you ain't got no choice
but to come down and fuck with me.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.225
- Been trying to get y'all nigga--
- Fuck you, nigga.

23:47.301 --> 23:49.975
The fuck you think I'm doin' here?
You think these bags for show, nigga?

23:50.054 --> 23:51.601
What's up? What we selling? What they got?

23:51.680 --> 23:53.853
I mean, they got a little bit
of everything, kna' mean?

23:54.141 --> 23:55.313
They fuck with everything.

23:55.809 --> 23:58.653
But we just gotta move wisely,
and make sure it go right.

23:58.729 --> 24:01.357
We can't be on no renegade shit,
doing no dumb shit.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.617
You know these lower eastside niggas
don't fuck with us Harlem--

24:03.692 --> 24:04.693
Man, fuck them niggas.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.074
- What we selling?
- Got the coke.

24:06.570 --> 24:09.870
Kna' mean? Got the crack
where niggas smoke it in the pipe.

24:10.199 --> 24:13.248
And these nigga's weirdos,

Got the dope.

24:14.578 --> 24:15.875
Got the heron.

24:16.372 --> 24:17.248
Kna' mean?

24:17.331 --> 24:19.584
The best shit down here is that dust.

24:19.917 --> 24:21.260
- Dust?
- Yeah, that dust.

24:21.335 --> 24:22.552
Niggas still fuck with dust?

24:22.628 --> 24:23.629
Do they.

24:23.879 --> 24:25.847
My nigga, down here...

24:26.048 --> 24:27.925
these niggas is zombies for that dust.

24:28.008 --> 24:29.476
Like zombies, like,

24:30.094 --> 24:31.061
that's where the money at.

24:31.136 --> 24:33.480
Kna' mean? All through the lower eastside.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.649
Say now more, nigga, let's ride.

24:37.309 --> 24:40.313
<i>- Bottle of Pepsi...
- Mike and Dee got his team from uptown,</i>

24:40.729 --> 24:42.356
<i>and set up shop in the park.</i>

24:49.029 --> 24:49.996
<i>This is Tito.</i>

24:50.572 --> 24:52.870
<i>And he's lived in Loisaidas
his whole life.</i>

24:53.325 --> 24:54.702
<i>And he gets money in that park.</i>

24:55.327 --> 24:57.045
<i>And the rules are the same everywhere.</i>

24:57.413 --> 25:01.589
<i>You can't just set up shop on somebody
else's block and think you can get money.</i>

25:04.753 --> 25:08.178
<i>So he sends his goons
in the park to rectify the situation.</i>

25:09.258 --> 25:11.226
My niggas, man, my niggas, man.

25:11.301 --> 25:12.427
What's going on?

25:12.511 --> 25:15.435
Now, who the fuck sanctioned
y'all to come out here and get paper, B?

25:15.514 --> 25:16.891
Nobody give us permission.

25:17.850 --> 25:18.772
Oh, nah?

25:19.184 --> 25:20.106
Ah.

25:22.479 --> 25:25.733
See the face on this nigga?
Where they do that at?

25:26.275 --> 25:27.322
This ain't your strip, B.

25:29.111 --> 25:30.363
You laughing?

25:30.446 --> 25:32.073
Get the fuck outta here, nigga!

25:32.156 --> 25:33.373
We gave y'all niggas the giggles.

25:33.449 --> 25:35.122
Fuck is your problem, man?

25:35.200 --> 25:37.453
- Y'all got the giggles tonight, huh?
- Damn, man.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.379
Little, young boy with you too.

25:40.122 --> 25:41.624
Get the fuck outta here, man.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.426
Bum-ass shirt you got on, nigga.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.797
Ain't nothing to joke
out here but you, man.

26:07.941 --> 26:10.160
<i>This had Tito tight,
but he had to get low.</i>

26:13.781 --> 26:16.330
<i>But this situation was far from over.</i>

26:18.118 --> 26:19.495
<i>Dee and Mike got to work.</i>

26:19.995 --> 26:21.087
<i>And got that park clicking.</i>

26:22.247 --> 26:23.499
<i>Mike loved it downtown.</i>

26:25.334 --> 26:26.256
<i>The money was good.</i>

26:27.419 --> 26:29.137
<i>And there was so many Spanish girls.</i>

26:32.132 --> 26:33.554
<i>Mike had everybody working.</i>

26:34.009 --> 26:35.477
<i>He even put his little mans on.</i>

26:36.929 --> 26:39.557
<i>And then Tito sent another one
of his goons in the park</i>

26:39.640 --> 26:42.018
<i>and this stupid-ass nigga
threatened the little dude.</i>

26:42.810 --> 26:44.027
Lotta money out here, huh.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.688
A little somethin'. What's happening?

26:46.230 --> 26:47.197
Work on your left, man.

26:47.523 --> 26:48.866
I need some of what y'all got.

26:49.358 --> 26:50.154
Oh, really?

26:50.234 --> 26:52.532
- Yeah, really.
- Can't accommodate you on that one.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.989
You see, we know you got
little homie out here getting money.

26:55.072 --> 26:56.619
We know where he go to school at.

26:57.908 --> 26:59.080
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.717
<i>And that's when shit got crazy.</i>

27:25.018 --> 27:28.397
<i>At that point, Mike decided to come uptown
to holler at me.</i>

27:28.939 --> 27:30.566
<i>There was so much money downtown.</i>

27:30.899 --> 27:32.617
<i>And this was a job for the professionals.</i>

27:35.070 --> 27:36.697
<i>I told him to go holler at Kite.</i>

27:37.030 --> 27:38.703
<i>And not to be so fucking sloppy.</i>

27:38.991 --> 27:40.914
<i>You can't spend none
of that money in jail.</i>

27:41.952 --> 27:43.579
<i>Kite told Mike to line 'em up.</i>

27:43.787 --> 27:45.334
<i>Just show him where they crew be at,</i>

27:45.414 --> 27:46.757
<i>and they'd take care of the rest.</i>

27:47.416 --> 27:49.009
<i>He also told him to get with Primo.</i>

27:49.293 --> 27:50.920
<i>And to bring a young, thorough shooter,</i>

27:51.295 --> 27:52.763
<i>so they could send the proper message.</i>

28:06.101 --> 28:10.607
<i>Mike told Dee, who knew exactly which one
of his young proteges to go get.</i>

28:30.626 --> 28:31.548
Yo?

28:32.127 --> 28:33.174
Fuck these niggas.

28:34.129 --> 28:35.346
All right.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.726
- What's good, baby?
- What's good?

28:40.093 --> 28:41.470
- What's poppin', man?
- Chilling, chilling.

28:41.553 --> 28:42.475
Yeah.

28:43.430 --> 28:44.647
What up, B?

28:44.890 --> 28:47.313
- Shit, chilling, man, chilling.
- Have a seat, man.

28:49.311 --> 28:50.858
- What's up with you, kid?
- Chilling.

28:50.938 --> 28:52.360
You ride your bike over here?

28:52.522 --> 28:54.991
Yeah, pedal to the metal,
you know how that goes.

28:55.067 --> 28:57.069
Bike riding-ass nigga.
You saw the game last night?

28:57.152 --> 29:00.497
Yeah, that game was crazy, man.
They lost by, like, 4O points yesterday.

29:00.781 --> 29:02.909
Fucking Knicks gonna make me
catch a heart-attack.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.538
I know, man. I can't bet on them.

29:04.618 --> 29:06.086
But, yo, enough of all this.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.209
Explain to me this
Loisaidas situation, though.

29:11.124 --> 29:13.047
- What you wanna know about that?
- I wanna know everything.

31:54.162 --> 31:56.335
<i>Primo and Kite definitely sent
the right message.</i>

31:56.790 --> 31:58.007
<i>And Tito was next.</i>

31:58.417 --> 32:01.921
<i>But these situations sometimes have a way
of taking care of themselves.</i>

32:02.003 --> 32:03.300
Let me get a pack of Newports.

32:03.380 --> 32:06.259
<i>Tito also had a local problem
that he was underestimating.</i>

32:06.341 --> 32:07.968
Fuckin' stressful-ass day, my nigga.

32:08.802 --> 32:10.975
Shit's weird around here, dog,
I don't even know anymore.

32:11.054 --> 32:13.477
I feel like people is watching me
and shit, you know?

32:15.600 --> 32:16.522
You know? Like--

32:16.685 --> 32:17.811
- You speak Spanish, my nigga?
- Nah.

32:17.894 --> 32:19.612
- Wait, you're not Dominican?
- Arab.

32:21.356 --> 32:22.357
What's up, baby?

32:22.983 --> 32:24.155
Chilling nigga, what's up?

32:27.946 --> 32:28.868
My fiigga...

32:31.783 --> 32:33.706
I've known that nigga
since he was this big, right?

32:38.665 --> 32:40.884
We're already super-good, my nigga.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.632
Feel me? All right.

32:47.924 --> 32:50.518
- We good. I know you Dominican, you lying.
- Nah.Nah.

32:50.594 --> 32:51.811
You no Arabian asses.

32:53.597 --> 32:56.100
<i>One of his childhood friends
who he used to hustle with</i>

32:56.183 --> 32:58.231
<i>did a bid for him and just came home.</i>

33:14.576 --> 33:15.748
<i>His name was Monster.</i>

33:16.244 --> 33:18.087
<i>And him and his man were straight killers.</i>

33:36.389 --> 33:37.436
<i>They were wolves.</i>

33:37.682 --> 33:39.810
<i>They were the dudes
that would get cool with their connect</i>

33:39.893 --> 33:41.110
<i>just so they could rob 'em.</i>

34:14.261 --> 34:16.389
<i>Tito used to set up stickups for Monster.</i>

34:16.721 --> 34:19.474
<i>And Monster did a bid for a robbery
they were all down with.</i>

34:19.558 --> 34:21.652
<i>And he didn't think
Tito looked out for him enough.</i>

34:28.024 --> 34:30.025
<i>Monster came home and he sent for Tito.</i>

34:30.443 --> 34:33.196
<i>I guess Tito thought shit was sweet
'cause they grew up together.</i>

34:52.007 --> 34:52.929
My fiigga.

34:53.049 --> 34:55.143
Oh shit, what's...

34:56.094 --> 34:57.141
What's Gucci?

34:57.846 --> 34:59.894
Ain't shit, my nigga. You know.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.605
...you know, doing my thing.

35:03.351 --> 35:06.446
Yeah, I've been waiting for you to get
out. I heard you got it. What's good?

35:06.521 --> 35:07.443
"What's good"?

35:08.732 --> 35:10.700
Man, you a funny-ass nigga.

35:11.568 --> 35:13.366
You know I did that bid for you.

35:13.862 --> 35:15.830
All you did was send me
a little commissary?

35:16.072 --> 35:18.200
Listen, nobody told you
to do that shit like that.

35:18.283 --> 35:20.581
That shit was not supposed to
go down like that. For real.

35:49.397 --> 35:50.364
<i>And just like that,</i>

35:51.149 --> 35:52.401
<i>Tito was out the game.</i>

35:53.109 --> 35:55.077
<i>Mike's problem had taken care of itself.</i>

35:55.820 --> 35:57.572
<i>That happens that way sometime
in the hood.</i>

35:58.073 --> 35:59.416
<i>But then this happened:</i>

36:01.493 --> 36:03.211
I understand you're willing
to provide information

36:03.286 --> 36:04.629
on an ongoing investigation.

36:05.205 --> 36:08.084
As long as you got my back,
I'll tell you everything you need to know.

36:08.375 --> 36:10.093
<i>This is what you call a snitch.</i>

36:10.377 --> 36:11.344
<i>Basically a rat.</i>

36:11.961 --> 36:14.760
<i>And this rat-bastard just got
picked up for something petty.</i>

36:15.131 --> 36:16.098
<i>A weed charge.</i>

36:16.174 --> 36:17.767
<i>He got the weed from his uncle.</i>

36:18.134 --> 36:20.432
<i>Who just so happened to be
Primo's Italian connect.</i>

36:20.762 --> 36:22.810
<i>So this cooperating piece of dogshit</i>

36:22.972 --> 36:24.849
<i>decides to give up
his own flesh and blood.</i>

36:25.308 --> 36:27.060
<i>'Cause he's not man enough to do the time.</i>

36:27.852 --> 36:28.819
I have the perfect person.

36:28.978 --> 36:31.857
We have an agent who specializes
specifically in your kind of case.

36:31.940 --> 36:33.658
Give me a moment,
he'll be here in a second.

36:34.401 --> 36:36.779
<i>The thing that makes a rat
such a piece of shit</i>

36:36.861 --> 36:39.114
<i>is because he consciously
signs on to the game,</i>

36:39.197 --> 36:41.074
<i>gets close to the people he hustles with</i>

36:41.157 --> 36:42.329
<i>and when he gets in trouble,</i>

36:42.534 --> 36:45.629
<i>he tells on his friends
so he doesn't have to do the time.</i>

36:46.413 --> 36:47.630
<i>We don't fuck with rats,</i>

36:47.914 --> 36:49.541
<i>and we don't fuck with anyone</i>

36:49.624 --> 36:50.841
<i>that fucks with rats.</i>

36:52.127 --> 36:53.299
<i>Meet Detective Kean.</i>

36:53.753 --> 36:55.972
<i>He was a specialist
in making criminals cooperate.</i>

36:56.381 --> 36:58.224
<i>He felt there was a rat in every criminal</i>

36:58.299 --> 36:59.266
<i>and with the right approach</i>

36:59.342 --> 37:01.310
<i>the inner rat would always reveal itself.</i>

37:01.678 --> 37:03.555
<i>And once Detective Kean
looked under the hood</i>

37:03.638 --> 37:05.686
<i>and found out this dude
was working with Primo.</i>

37:06.015 --> 37:08.234
<i>He looked at that as an opportunity
to get the work.</i>

37:08.309 --> 37:09.982
I'm telling you,
you're gonna do time.

37:10.937 --> 37:12.985
Gonna do a lot of time, Victor, my friend.

37:16.151 --> 37:17.243
Are you not gonna talk?

37:17.819 --> 37:18.741
Huh?

37:19.696 --> 37:20.618
Talk to me.

37:20.864 --> 37:22.832
- I gotta honor up here.
- Uh-huh.

37:24.993 --> 37:25.960
All right.

37:26.453 --> 37:27.830
Coke. Crack.

37:28.329 --> 37:29.455
Dust. Heroin.

37:30.540 --> 37:31.837
You know about these things, right?

37:34.836 --> 37:35.837
You trust these guys?

37:36.546 --> 37:37.923
You never heard of Primo and Kite?

37:38.631 --> 37:39.427
Hm?

37:39.507 --> 37:41.100
They'll fucking turn you out, man.

37:41.259 --> 37:42.181
I'm telling you.

37:43.386 --> 37:44.308
Talk to me.

37:44.929 --> 37:45.851
Talk to me and...

37:46.514 --> 37:47.731
I'll make it work for you.

37:48.725 --> 37:50.022
Tell me about the drugs.

37:50.685 --> 37:52.358
- And the bodies.
- Bodies?

37:52.604 --> 37:54.277
- Yeah.
- I don't know nothing about no bodies.

37:54.355 --> 37:56.278
- I never pulled no triggers.
- They're all over the streets.

37:56.357 --> 37:58.109
You got a problem with them,
talk to them.

37:58.193 --> 38:00.321
Fifteen, twenty bodies
all over 127th and 142nd.

38:00.403 --> 38:02.371
- You know. Go talk to them.
- No, no, you know.

38:05.241 --> 38:08.085
You're gonna go to jail
for fucking moulinyans?

38:08.369 --> 38:10.121
Your wife won't have
a husband because of niggas?

38:10.205 --> 38:11.548
Who's gonna be your wife's boyfriend?

38:11.706 --> 38:12.707
A big, black nigga.

38:13.875 --> 38:15.877
A big, black nigga.
Think about that image.

38:16.169 --> 38:17.887
I want you to think about that image, now.

38:19.839 --> 38:22.308
Talk to me soon
'cause the clock is ticking, my friend.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.432
You don't know about these niggas?
You wanna protect them?

38:26.429 --> 38:28.147
You're gonna go right
with those moulinyans.

38:28.723 --> 38:30.475
Definitely gonna do
a lot of time, paisano.

38:31.059 --> 38:31.981
What's wrong with you?

38:32.393 --> 38:33.315
Come on.

38:34.395 --> 38:35.442
Don't mind honor up.

38:36.231 --> 38:37.153
Smarten up.

38:37.565 --> 38:39.738
<i>Detective Kean was a racist bastard.</i>

38:40.151 --> 38:42.279
<i>And the race card conveniently
always worked for him.</i>

38:43.071 --> 38:45.745
<i>And this canary started to sing
like a little bitch.</i>

38:48.368 --> 38:50.462
<i>If you're not gonna respect the game,</i>

38:50.537 --> 38:52.289
<i>I don't suggest you play it.</i>

38:52.372 --> 38:54.420
<i>Disrespect will get you killed.</i>

38:55.416 --> 38:57.794
<i>Some dudes we knew, owed Primo some money.</i>

38:58.378 --> 39:01.757
<i>He decides to come around with his boys
to Primo's block and roll dice.</i>

39:01.965 --> 39:05.185
<i>He was a killer as well, so I guess
he thought he could just do that.</i>

39:05.260 --> 39:08.184
<i>Primo took that as a direct sign
of disrespect and a threat.</i>

39:08.263 --> 39:10.436
<i>According to rules
that Primo was teaching,</i>

39:10.515 --> 39:12.313
<i>him and his boys had to go.</i>

39:12.392 --> 39:14.770
<i>It was the honorable thing to do.</i>

39:21.818 --> 39:23.570
<i>After Detective Kean heard this story,</i>

39:23.653 --> 39:25.826
<i>he had enough to pick up Primo
and his whole crew.</i>

39:29.284 --> 39:31.207
<i>Getting picked up is a part of the game.</i>

39:32.161 --> 39:33.538
<i>It's expected at some point.</i>

39:34.205 --> 39:36.048
<i>It's where your character
is truly defined.</i>

39:36.958 --> 39:38.881
<i>These dudes were comfortable
in this environment,</i>

39:38.960 --> 39:39.961
<i>They knew the drill.</i>

39:40.461 --> 39:41.963
<i>If you're man enough to do the crime...</i>

39:42.380 --> 39:43.927
<i>then be man enough to do the time.</i>

39:44.173 --> 39:45.720
<i>Snitching is never an option.</i>

39:47.093 --> 39:49.016
Tell me about your
OG gangster buddies, there.

39:49.762 --> 39:50.558
Primo...

39:50.638 --> 39:51.935
I'm looking at 4O years,

39:52.015 --> 39:54.234
if that's what the Lord deem right for me,

39:54.475 --> 39:55.727
then I accept my fate.

39:56.394 --> 39:57.316
We're done here.

39:57.437 --> 39:58.984
Think about talking to me.

39:59.188 --> 40:01.361
- You gotta think about--
-'Cause I'm the fucking guy you got.

40:01.441 --> 40:03.409
Who's your OG?
Talk to me about your OG.

40:03.484 --> 40:04.906
I wanna hear some stories, come on.

40:04.986 --> 40:07.330
- My OG is your wife.
- Yeah, that's my wife?

40:07.530 --> 40:09.749
- We butt-fucked your wife.
- Yeah, all right.

40:09.824 --> 40:11.371
She sucked our shitty dicks.

40:13.453 --> 40:14.921
<i>And remember the major coins?</i>

40:16.331 --> 40:19.050
<i>One of them got picked up 'cause Kite
left some work in the apartment</i>

40:19.250 --> 40:20.422
<i>and it was in her name.</i>

40:22.420 --> 40:24.343
Look, girl. You fuckin' up.

40:24.505 --> 40:26.803
Your grandmother is ringing
my phone off the hook.

40:26.883 --> 40:28.100
She say you need to snitch.

40:28.176 --> 40:30.850
You sitting here over some shit
that got nothing to do with you.

40:31.387 --> 40:33.606
Nu-uh, I got a reputation
in these streets.

40:34.182 --> 40:35.434
What? You too honorable now?

40:35.683 --> 40:36.855
You're not even a nigga, boo.

40:38.311 --> 40:40.734
There's a new connect in town.
Look at this shit.

40:41.022 --> 40:42.740
And you need to shut the fuck up...

40:44.901 --> 40:47.029
<i>She was honorable,
she didn't say a word.</i>

40:47.278 --> 40:49.246
<i>She'd rather sit in there
than be considered a rat.</i>

40:50.031 --> 40:51.248
<i>They let her out eventually though.</i>

41:01.709 --> 41:02.961
I like you, Primo.

41:03.503 --> 41:05.380
You're like an old-school guy.

41:05.922 --> 41:07.299
I could talk to you. You know?

41:08.299 --> 41:10.518
You know, you go way back. I go way back.

41:11.302 --> 41:12.224
Come on, Primo.

41:12.887 --> 41:14.514
You're a good guy. Be a 900d 911V-

41:14.597 --> 41:15.519
Huh?

41:16.057 --> 41:17.400
So, you talk to me about honor.

41:17.684 --> 41:19.357
There is no honor, Primo.

41:19.811 --> 41:21.563
Man, you just save your ass.

41:22.563 --> 41:23.985
I understand your street code.

41:24.065 --> 41:26.534
I understand your code
of ethics and honor.

41:26.776 --> 41:27.902
- Do you?
- Yeah.

41:28.569 --> 41:29.866
- Do you?
- I do.

41:29.946 --> 41:33.325
If you do, you wouldn't be asking me
to snitch and talk to you at all.

41:33.408 --> 41:35.502
I'm not asking you to snitch.
I'm trying to help you.

41:35.576 --> 41:37.419
Listen to me. Listen to me.

41:37.704 --> 41:38.580
I'm from Harlem.

41:38.663 --> 41:40.336
142nd Street,

41:40.415 --> 41:43.589
127th Street, 110th Street, 150--

41:43.668 --> 41:45.045
- I'm from Harlem.
- I get it!

41:45.294 --> 41:46.762
At the end of the day,

41:47.005 --> 41:49.258
I'm raised from a different type of breed.

41:49.799 --> 41:51.642
And them tactics that you using,

41:52.260 --> 41:53.557
those is for cowards.

41:54.637 --> 41:56.480
You sitting in front of a man,

41:57.515 --> 41:59.768
so don't play no fucking games with me.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.691
You do your job; I'm gonna do my job.

42:03.563 --> 42:05.657
At the end of the day, we don't snitch.

42:06.274 --> 42:07.070
I'm honorable.

42:07.150 --> 42:09.152
And when I come home,
I'ma still be honorable.

42:09.944 --> 42:10.991
I'm trying to help you.

42:12.321 --> 42:13.413
There's a way out.

42:14.949 --> 42:17.452
I appreciate your help,
but I don't need it.

42:18.995 --> 42:20.338
There's nothing you could do for me.

42:22.165 --> 42:23.382
There's no more to be said.

42:25.293 --> 42:27.136
<i>We all knew
the Italian dude was Snitching.</i>

42:27.211 --> 42:30.090
<i>I had to face the reality
that Primo might have to do some time.</i>

42:30.381 --> 42:32.179
<i>So he sent for me. He had a plan.</i>

42:32.258 --> 42:34.101
<i>He wanted to make sure my mind was right.</i>

42:34.177 --> 42:35.520
- What's happening?
- I'm all right, how you?

42:35.595 --> 42:36.562
- Good, how you doing?
- Good.

42:36.637 --> 42:38.890
Nigga, you didn't bring no change,
no coins for the machine?

42:38.973 --> 42:40.099
I'm not eating nothing in there.

42:40.183 --> 42:41.605
Plus, I don't carry coins, man.

42:41.684 --> 42:43.277
Just cash, it's not a strip club, man.

42:43.352 --> 42:45.980
That shit in the machine
is like steak to me, man.

42:46.064 --> 42:48.066
- That's crazy.
- Yo, listen, man,

42:48.649 --> 42:51.368
I wanted to talk to you about--
This shit is kinda important to me.

42:52.570 --> 42:53.696
It's over.

42:54.238 --> 42:55.490
Them niggas is snitching.

42:56.157 --> 42:57.454
The connect is snitching.

42:57.825 --> 42:59.668
The connect snitch,
the nigga you hit snitch,

43:00.703 --> 43:02.751
anybody can snitch,
there's too much exposure.

43:02.830 --> 43:04.423
And I just want you to stay safe.

43:04.499 --> 43:06.968
I don't want you to get
caught up in this shit here, B.

43:07.043 --> 43:08.260
There's too many rats.

43:08.419 --> 43:09.466
It's not worth it.

43:09.545 --> 43:12.924
And I'm not gonna have you
in the mother fucker with me, B.

43:13.007 --> 43:14.008
You hear me, my nigga?

43:14.675 --> 43:15.892
<i>The show had to go on.</i>

43:16.135 --> 43:18.229
<i>And Primo had a situation for us upstate.</i>

43:18.846 --> 43:20.848
<i>He wanted me and the young dudes
to go there.</i>

43:21.015 --> 43:22.437
<i>But he had some concerns.</i>

43:22.517 --> 43:25.487
Nigga, them lil' niggas
is young and wild, man.

43:25.561 --> 43:27.859
Gonna have to tame 'em. Calm 'em down.

43:27.939 --> 43:30.738
You're gonna have to 'cause that shit
gonna reflect you in the long run.

43:31.400 --> 43:32.526
I love you, man.

43:32.610 --> 43:34.578
You my brother from another mother.

43:35.363 --> 43:36.865
You the only nigga, man,

43:37.448 --> 43:38.825

43:39.575 --> 43:42.704
Only nigga that really--
You know what I mean? Listen, man.

43:42.787 --> 43:44.004
That's why you out there

43:44.580 --> 43:45.627

43:46.415 --> 43:48.042
Take advantage of this shit, my nigga.

43:48.376 --> 43:49.298
Kna' mean?

43:49.710 --> 43:52.589
L'ma stab a few niggas,
who knows when you're gonna see me again.

43:52.672 --> 43:55.266
But you? You the future, man.

43:56.008 --> 43:56.975
<i>Primo was strong.</i>

43:57.677 --> 44:00.556
<i>He was facing life and he was trying
to make sure I was all right.</i>

44:01.264 --> 44:02.891
You ain't got to be a killer...

44:03.307 --> 44:04.229
a drug dealer...

44:04.809 --> 44:07.062
none of that shit to earn your points.

44:07.353 --> 44:09.981
Know what I mean?
You could find another route for us, man.

44:10.273 --> 44:12.196
I know you can do it, you that nigga, man.

44:12.275 --> 44:13.401
You always been.

44:14.068 --> 44:15.991

- Just stay honorable.

44:16.320 --> 44:18.948
You ain't gotta come to jail to prove
that you're honorable, nigga.

44:19.031 --> 44:21.079
Be an honorable nigga to your family.

44:21.450 --> 44:24.169
Stay away from sucka-niggas,
that's honorable.

44:24.245 --> 44:25.997
Don't fuck with niggas that ain't right.

44:26.080 --> 44:28.959
We don't support them niggas,
we don't buy from them niggas.

44:29.125 --> 44:30.172
You know what it is.

44:30.251 --> 44:31.878
You've been around me too long.

44:32.086 --> 44:33.133
It's in our blood.

44:33.337 --> 44:34.554
It's in your blood, man.

44:35.339 --> 44:36.431
I love you, m)' “i993-

44:36.716 --> 44:37.888
- I love you too.
- Come 'round.

44:38.217 --> 44:39.093
And don't worry.

44:39.177 --> 44:40.053
I remember.

44:40.136 --> 44:42.559
We not hustling for our first,
we're hustling for our last.

44:42.638 --> 44:44.390
Most fucking right. Honor up.

44:44.599 --> 44:45.646
- Honor up.
- Honor up, nigga.

44:45.725 --> 44:47.147
- My nigga.
- Word, B.

44:47.226 --> 44:50.025
Keep your weight up, nigga.
Start doing some pushups too.

44:50.104 --> 44:51.902
Don't worry about that.
My knuckle game is rough.

44:51.981 --> 44:53.278
All right, CO, all right.

44:53.858 --> 44:56.361
- Yo, I love you.
- I got you. My nigga, I love you too.

44:56.444 --> 44:58.321
I'll see you, man.
Don't even worry about.

44:58.404 --> 44:59.326
All right.

45:05.745 --> 45:06.667
Fuck.

45:10.625 --> 45:13.344
CO! Get the fuck up outta here, man.

45:14.295 --> 45:16.172
<i>Black and Kite just took their time.</i>

45:16.464 --> 45:18.091
<i>Kite had way too many bodies</i>

45:18.299 --> 45:20.393
<i>and they were thinking
about giving him the electric chair.</i>

45:20.801 --> 45:22.519
<i>Primo decided to take it to trial.</i>

45:22.845 --> 45:25.064
<i>They only had one witness
and he wasn't credible.</i>

45:25.765 --> 45:26.687
<i>But it the meantime,</i>

45:26.933 --> 45:28.526
<i>I put Primo's plan into effect.</i>

45:29.310 --> 45:30.562
<i>We took them things upstate.</i>

45:31.312 --> 45:32.859
<i>We would bring 'em up on a motorcycle.</i>

45:33.564 --> 45:34.531
<i>Shit was lovely.</i>

45:34.982 --> 45:37.280
<i>We need to move this forward
in upstate New York.</i>

45:37.777 --> 45:39.074
We have people lined up.

45:39.487 --> 45:42.161
Now we have the people
that are going to support this initiative.

45:43.157 --> 45:44.784
What we've been doing
for a long time.

45:44.867 --> 45:46.710
<i>Primo even had an in with the mayor.</i>

45:47.119 --> 45:48.666
<i>He was also criminal minded.</i>

45:49.038 --> 45:51.336
<i>Apparently, Primo was locked up
with his brother.</i>

45:51.874 --> 45:54.002
<i>He was pushing to make weed
legal in this state.</i>

45:54.418 --> 45:57.012
<i>And for the right price,
he was gonna let us in on that.</i>

45:57.463 --> 45:59.181
<i>All we had to do was keep things cool.</i>

45:59.507 --> 46:00.759
<i>Stay away from the violence.</i>

46:01.175 --> 46:02.097
<i>Just get money.</i>

46:05.179 --> 46:06.431
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

46:14.855 --> 46:16.072
Uh-huh.

46:16.524 --> 46:17.446
Philly-boy, huh?

46:17.984 --> 46:19.361
I love those fucking cheesesteaks.

46:19.860 --> 46:20.986
Pat's or Gino's, huh?

46:22.530 --> 46:23.827
<i>Let me tell you about O.</i>

46:24.282 --> 46:26.455
O <i>was doing life
for</i> a <i>series of violent crimes.</i>

46:26.534 --> 46:29.003
<i>And was only there
because of a snitch. A rat.</i>

46:29.203 --> 46:30.500
<i>And he hated every one of 'em.</i>

46:30.579 --> 46:33.173
<i>So whatever jail he was in,
if he got some paperwork,</i>

46:33.249 --> 46:35.593
<i>he would put in that work.
He was gonna out you.</i>

46:35.668 --> 46:37.261
<i>- Try to kill you.</i>
- Fuck these <i>niggas, man.</i>

46:37.336 --> 46:39.464
These cats have no idea
what the fuck they in for.

46:39.547 --> 46:41.424
I tell you--

46:41.507 --> 46:43.384
CO!

46:43.801 --> 46:44.768
<i>He didn't give a fuck.</i>

46:45.011 --> 46:46.729
<i>He was doing life plus 30 anyway.</i>

46:46.887 --> 46:48.389
Give me all the fucking time you want,

46:48.723 --> 46:50.350
I'm killing every fucking snitch I see.

46:50.558 --> 46:52.310
- You're lucky I got my fucking...
- CO!

46:52.393 --> 46:53.645
- Fuck outta here.
- Hey.

46:53.728 --> 46:58.029
<i>And it just so happened, they put
Primds rat in the same jail as O.</i>

47:21.881 --> 47:24.634
<i>And just like that,
Primo was on his way home.</i>

47:24.925 --> 47:25.926
<i>No witnesses.</i>

48:01.629 --> 48:03.381
<i>I did right by Primo while he was away.</i>

48:04.298 --> 48:05.675
<i>I put his plan in affect.</i>

48:06.092 --> 48:07.435
<i>And we did better than we thought.</i>

48:07.968 --> 48:09.470
<i>We was getting all kinds of money.</i>

48:09.804 --> 48:12.899
<i>I was able to pay for Kite's lawyers,
make sure they didn't put him to sleep.</i>

48:12.973 --> 48:15.271
<i>And I was able to buy Primo
a house and some acres.</i>

48:15.351 --> 48:16.728
<i>So he could get out the way.</i>

48:17.103 --> 48:18.855
<i>Bring his crew upstate
and start getting some money.</i>

48:18.938 --> 48:20.531
How'd it feel, man? Talk.

48:22.400 --> 48:24.448
Make good money up here, baby.

48:24.860 --> 48:25.861
It is what it is.

48:27.405 --> 48:29.373
You know a nigga never do good in jail.

48:29.907 --> 48:31.830
You did it like a man,
you did it honorably.

48:33.160 --> 48:34.082
Real nigga shit.

48:34.662 --> 48:37.256
I didn't really think I'd ever
get to hang out with you again.

48:37.957 --> 48:38.879
You know that day,

48:40.167 --> 48:41.669
I volunteered to come with you.

48:43.170 --> 48:46.595
You know I always wondered,
if the reason why you didn't want me to go

48:46.674 --> 48:48.426
is 'cause you thought I'd fuck shit up
or...

48:48.801 --> 48:52.146
-or you didn't think I could do the time.
- That's what you thought, man?

48:52.721 --> 48:53.643
I didn't know.

48:53.931 --> 48:55.308
Nah, it wasn't that.

48:56.100 --> 48:58.774
I just knew you wasn't built
for that situation.

48:59.019 --> 49:00.646
You was built for something bigger.

49:01.564 --> 49:03.407
See, I got goons for everything,

49:03.482 --> 49:07.578
some dude's life is heading
in the wrong direction.

49:07.653 --> 49:10.372
I ain't gonna put a good nigga
in a bad predicament.

49:10.448 --> 49:12.496
That ain't what an honorable dude do.

49:12.992 --> 49:15.086
A lot of dudes don't really get saved.

49:15.161 --> 49:16.128
Know what I mean?

49:17.830 --> 49:20.333
You just a type of brother
that took all that shit in...

49:20.875 --> 49:22.297
and made the most of it.

49:23.461 --> 49:26.214
Outta ten niggas that a nigga
tried to look out for,

49:26.839 --> 49:28.091
you probably the only one

49:28.591 --> 49:30.138
really built on it, you know?

49:30.885 --> 49:32.387
And it turns out, I was right.

49:33.137 --> 49:34.309
Now that we're here.

49:34.972 --> 49:36.269
You gotta think different.

49:37.475 --> 49:40.900
And that's why it's so important
that we tell and show everybody

49:41.979 --> 49:43.981
that there is a future in honor.

49:44.857 --> 49:46.450
- Fact
- The way the mayor got things,

49:46.525 --> 49:47.651
in a couple of years,

49:48.527 --> 49:49.995
we'll be able to sell weed legally.

49:51.030 --> 49:52.407
We not thinking about our first name,

49:53.407 --> 49:54.750
we thinking about our last.

49:55.576 --> 49:57.419
What you doing for me and my team,

49:57.953 --> 50:00.752
that's the most honorable thing
a brother could do.

50:00.831 --> 50:02.799
Pardon me,
you gotta stop saying that, man.

50:03.918 --> 50:05.090
I didn't do nothing for you.

50:05.419 --> 50:06.762
You did everything.

50:06.962 --> 50:09.556
You taught me and told me exactly...

50:10.299 --> 50:13.269
what I needed to do, what I needed
to be to get us here today.

50:13.344 --> 50:14.311
This is your plan.

50:14.386 --> 50:16.388
But you coulda kept this to yourself.

50:16.472 --> 50:17.689
It was your plan.

50:18.724 --> 50:20.067
That's why I love you, B.

50:20.351 --> 50:21.944
You don't forget where you come from.

50:22.019 --> 50:22.861
That's honorable.

50:22.937 --> 50:23.859
You know.

50:26.941 --> 50:29.239
<i>Primo couldn't believe how well
we were doing upstate.</i>

50:29.318 --> 50:30.615
<i>And he was proud of me.</i>

50:31.153 --> 50:32.075
<i>And of course...</i>

50:32.196 --> 50:34.995
<i>Primo scooped up his old-school crew
and brought them upstate.</i>

50:35.157 --> 50:36.158
<i>So they could get money.</i>

50:36.242 --> 50:37.368
Honor up!

50:37.451 --> 50:38.794
- Yeah, money.
- Yeah.

50:39.537 --> 50:40.459
Get your own.

50:40.788 --> 50:42.790
You know, amongst honorable niggas,

50:42.873 --> 50:45.717
they don't even deserve
to sit at the table with us, B.

50:45.793 --> 50:49.923
Unless they got at least ten years
in the pen with their paperwork.

50:50.005 --> 50:51.598
Fact.

50:51.674 --> 50:52.971
- Honor up.
- Honor up.

50:53.050 --> 50:54.472
Honor up, my "i993-

50:54.843 --> 50:57.847
Nigga can't be strong
and weak at the same time.

50:57.930 --> 50:59.102
There's no such thing.

50:59.181 --> 51:00.433
That's all it takes

51:00.891 --> 51:02.609
for all of us to stay strong.

51:02.685 --> 51:04.437
I'm tired of these niggas, though, man.

51:04.895 --> 51:08.069
These niggas make me fucking sick, B.
Honor up.

51:08.148 --> 51:09.024
Honor up.

51:09.108 --> 51:11.406
These niggas snitching, telling.

51:11.652 --> 51:12.448
Facts.

51:12.528 --> 51:14.997
These motherfuckers getting
on my motherfucking nerve out here, B.

51:15.281 --> 51:16.077
Sure enough.

51:16.156 --> 51:19.376
One thing I don't know, man,
is how niggas try to stay strong,

51:19.451 --> 51:21.078
but not mentally, man.

51:21.161 --> 51:22.083
Honor up.

51:22.329 --> 51:24.673
I'm talking with honor, like real niggas.

51:24.748 --> 51:26.500
- We don't fuck with snitches.
- Honor up!

51:26.584 --> 51:28.086
Pardon me for cursing, my G.

51:28.168 --> 51:28.964
No problem.

51:29.044 --> 51:30.387
- Honor up!
- Honor up!

51:30.671 --> 51:31.718
I love y'all, man.

51:31.797 --> 51:32.673
Love you too, brother.

51:32.756 --> 51:34.975
You did the crime, you did the time.

51:35.050 --> 51:35.892
Sure 'nuff.

51:35.968 --> 51:37.515
And you did it honorably.

51:37.595 --> 51:38.437
Honor up!

51:38.512 --> 51:40.514
Real honorable shit amongst men,
you know?

51:40.598 --> 51:42.145
So it's just us against the world.

51:42.891 --> 51:44.268
- Honor up.
- Honor up.

51:44.768 --> 51:47.066
- This is what you get.
- Honor up.

51:47.146 --> 51:49.399
I'm not giving it to you. You earned this.

51:49.481 --> 51:51.904
- Honor up.
- You ain't come home to blocks.

51:51.984 --> 51:54.112
- You came home to acres, niggas.
- Honor up.

51:54.194 --> 51:55.946
We don't do this shit for our first name.

51:56.030 --> 51:58.704
- No. Never.
- We do this for our last name.

51:59.116 --> 52:02.666
- Honor up!
- Honor up!

52:02.745 --> 52:05.294
-60, my nigga, honor up!
- Honor up!

52:05.372 --> 52:06.624
Honor up!

52:06.707 --> 52:07.879
<i>And everything seemed to be working.</i>

52:08.208 --> 52:10.927
<i>I had my OGs, my young boys,
all working together.</i>

52:11.462 --> 52:12.805
<i>But then the bubblegum shit happened.</i>

52:15.007 --> 52:16.680
<i>Remember JR's fine sister?</i>

52:16.759 --> 52:17.931
<i>The one that was off limits?</i>

52:18.260 --> 52:19.182
<i>Well, this is her.</i>

52:19.720 --> 52:20.767
<i>She was nice in ball.</i>

52:20.846 --> 52:21.972
<i>She coulda had a future.</i>

52:22.056 --> 52:23.023
<i>Even played DI.</i>

52:23.515 --> 52:25.233
<i>But she chose the game
just like her brother.</i>

52:37.029 --> 52:39.782
<i>Growing up around JR's lifestyle
had her infatuated.</i>

52:40.032 --> 52:41.705
<i>And she chose the most dangerous hustle.</i>

53:19.947 --> 53:22.450
Yeah. Yo, what's up, bartender.

53:22.533 --> 53:26.504
Let me get two of the red joints,
the red merlots,

53:26.995 --> 53:28.087
for me and my girl.

53:29.498 --> 53:31.375
Think you funny with that shit.

53:31.792 --> 53:33.419
I knew you was gonna say that, ma.

53:34.670 --> 53:35.762
Sure enough.

53:39.466 --> 53:40.388
Yeah.

53:40.968 --> 53:42.185
Shit, yeah.

53:42.636 --> 53:44.138
Like I said, got one.

53:46.473 --> 53:49.317
Goddamn, girl, that was crack speed.

53:49.643 --> 53:51.145
I told you, they find me.

53:51.645 --> 53:52.646
Oh man.

53:55.023 --> 53:58.744
Make sure you call me, and make sure
you make that money, all right?

53:58.819 --> 54:01.743
Don't be stashing that, hold nothing back.

54:01.905 --> 54:03.703
How y'all fine bitches been?

54:04.742 --> 54:06.995
Don't be trying to shake
all that for yourself.

54:32.352 --> 54:34.525
Damn, fuck we doing
all the way out here, ma?

54:36.023 --> 54:36.945
It's my spot.

54:37.232 --> 54:39.781
Where I come to get away from it all.
Mm-hmm.

54:40.235 --> 54:41.157
Shit.

54:41.236 --> 54:43.204
Fuck you thought,
I was gonna go to your house?

54:43.280 --> 54:45.703
Yeah, shit woulda been better
than these fucking woods.

54:45.783 --> 54:48.536
You got me in the country, ma.
You even know about this shit.

54:49.703 --> 54:51.797
- Fuck out the car.
- Oh, shit.

54:52.289 --> 54:55.042
Fucking bitch. You fucking bi-- all right.

54:55.542 --> 54:56.464
I got it.

54:56.710 --> 54:59.213
Okay. Okay, all right, nigga, all right.

54:59.379 --> 55:01.552
All right, you got me mother fucker.
You gonna rob me?

55:01.632 --> 55:03.805
All right, you know who the fuck I am,
my nigga?

55:03.884 --> 55:05.010
Take the mother fucking car, nigga.

55:05.093 --> 55:06.640
You want the peanut butter guts, have it.

55:06.720 --> 55:08.438
Oh, what you want,
you want the jacket nigga?

55:08.597 --> 55:09.519
Take everything mother fucker.

55:10.224 --> 55:11.191
Nigga, fuck you!

55:40.212 --> 55:43.341
<i>Renee got picked up because she was
the last person to be seen with him.</i>

56:05.195 --> 56:06.287
You're a pretty girl, Renee.

56:07.614 --> 56:09.867
You know what they do
to pretty girls in jail? Huh?

56:12.619 --> 56:13.996
Oh, you wanna be just like JR.

56:14.705 --> 56:16.127
I hear you're related, you and him.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.172
You're like brother and sister.

56:20.711 --> 56:22.008
I know how you niggas are.

56:24.965 --> 56:26.467
You're gonna tell me something,
sweetheart.

56:28.093 --> 56:29.060
You hear what I'm saying?

56:29.845 --> 56:31.472
You're gonna tell me something today.

56:32.180 --> 56:34.478
You're gonna tell me something today,
otherwise you're going to jail.

56:34.808 --> 56:36.481
Never gonna see the light of day.

56:38.437 --> 56:40.110
Forget about those pretty nails.

56:44.026 --> 56:44.948
Let's go.

56:45.193 --> 56:46.160
Give it to me, sweetheart.

56:47.237 --> 56:48.363
<i>She didn't say a word.</i>

56:48.864 --> 56:51.208
<i>They didn't have anything
so they had to let her go.</i>

56:51.783 --> 56:55.378
<i>In this game, when you bring
someone around, you stand up for them.</i>

56:55.913 --> 56:57.915
<i>And that means you're responsible
for their actions.</i>

56:58.957 --> 57:00.800
<i>Now the problem with this situation</i>

57:01.835 --> 57:03.337
<i>was this was Kite's half-brother</i>

57:03.420 --> 57:05.923
<i>and he was only there on Kite's behalf
while he was gone.</i>

57:08.133 --> 57:11.307
<i>And we now know JR's sister was down
with it because she got picked up.</i>

57:12.012 --> 57:14.731
<i>So I knew someone in Dee and Mike's crew
must have been down too.</i>

57:15.140 --> 57:16.266
<i>And it happened upstate.</i>

57:16.683 --> 57:17.980
<i>Now, this was Primo's thing</i>

57:18.185 --> 57:19.653
<i>and it happened on my watch.</i>

57:19.937 --> 57:21.939
<i>I was tight because I knew
according to the rules,</i>

57:22.189 --> 57:24.157
<i>I was responsible. I had to handle it.</i>

57:24.524 --> 57:26.401
<i>Whoever was with her had violated.</i>

57:26.568 --> 57:27.410
<i>Number one,</i>

57:27.486 --> 57:30.080
<i>that was JR's sister,
so that was an issue too.</i>

57:36.662 --> 57:37.879
I hate to say this shit.

57:38.205 --> 57:40.378
I pride myself in not being emotional.

57:41.583 --> 57:43.711
But this some shit
I'm gonna have to deal with now.

57:44.836 --> 57:45.883
Y'all see what this is?

57:48.215 --> 57:51.185
This is what I gave y'all.
But y'all didn't earn this shit yet.

57:51.885 --> 57:52.932
Y'all didn't do no time.

57:53.804 --> 57:54.976
You ain't put in no work.

57:55.055 --> 57:55.977
I cosigned y'all.

57:56.348 --> 57:57.395
Everything's perfect.

57:57.849 --> 58:01.399
We have no issues, I can't understand
why anybody would fuck this up.

58:04.314 --> 58:05.566
Now, I need to know something.

58:05.857 --> 58:07.859
Where the fuck you was at
the day that happened.

58:07.943 --> 58:11.993
Big homey, I was with, me and Dee,
we was at the coffee shop,

58:12.072 --> 58:13.995
picking up some weed at the coffee spot.

58:14.491 --> 58:15.413
Me and Dee.

58:16.743 --> 58:18.086
Where you was at when this happened?

58:19.955 --> 58:22.879
Yo, don't even put me
on that dope fiend shit, yo.

58:22.958 --> 58:24.301
I ain't even on that, man.

58:24.376 --> 58:25.502
I just asked you a question.

58:25.585 --> 58:28.134
Bro, I was at my shorty house.

58:29.840 --> 58:32.434
I'm telling you, man.
I wasn't around, man.

58:32.509 --> 58:33.852
L'ma talk to you later.

58:33.927 --> 58:35.554
I need to holler at you.

58:38.640 --> 58:39.641
What up, OG?

58:48.567 --> 58:50.194
I'm not sure but I do know this;

58:52.863 --> 58:54.206
- That little black nigga?
- Yeah.

58:54.281 --> 58:55.282
He was with her.

59:01.121 --> 59:02.043
Take care of him.

59:02.497 --> 59:03.419
COPY-

59:04.291 --> 59:05.213
All right.

59:25.479 --> 59:29.529
Yo, you ain't tell me
that we gonna kill nobody.

59:31.485 --> 59:36.161
Yeah, this nigga's running around
here thinking that I killed this nigga.

59:41.286 --> 59:42.788
Yeah, all right.

59:59.596 --> 01:00:01.018
What are you talking about?

01:00:01.348 --> 01:00:03.442
You look like a Somalian water bug.

01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:06.403
Hit in the face looking-ass nigga.

01:00:08.396 --> 01:00:10.524
Can't nobody look as ugly as you.

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:12.154
You look like you one of one.

01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:13.906
Nobody look that bad.

01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:15.282
Fuck are you talking about.

01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:19.208
Nigga, wait, always talking
that dope fiend shit.

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:23.003
So that's why you still
be talking and nodding off all the time.

01:00:23.078 --> 01:00:23.920
Whatever, nigga.

01:00:23.995 --> 01:00:25.713
They call it heron...

01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:28.629
'cause once you fuck with it one time,

01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:32.929
you be hooked from "here on," nigga.

01:00:35.257 --> 01:00:36.600
Look at the butterfly.

01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:38.848
That shit came out your face, nigga.

01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:44.141
This nigga look like
a black seal out this mother fucker.

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:47.523
Told you, he on suicide watch.

01:00:47.602 --> 01:00:50.230
This nigga look like a booger with legs.

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:52.031
Word.

01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:54.235
You an alien, dope fiend-ass nigga.

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:58.697
Roaches walk up to you, nigga,
and they be like, "Daddy!"

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:01.033
Somebody get this nigga
a methadone clinic.

01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:02.959
He gonna shoot a nigga
before the night out.

01:01:05.412 --> 01:01:08.837
This nigga come from five generations

You roach-ugly nigga.

01:01:17.465 --> 01:01:18.387
Word up.

01:01:18.592 --> 01:01:19.718
- Your face--
- Yo, chill.

01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:21.895
You look like a burnt pumpkin seed.

01:01:23.597 --> 01:01:25.474
You ever had a bad sunflower seed

01:01:25.557 --> 01:01:28.026
and look in the middle
and it be that nigga.

01:01:28.101 --> 01:01:30.195
That rotten shit you gotta spit back out.

01:01:42.407 --> 01:01:43.954
<i>And I don't know how this shit happened,</i>

01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:46.750
<i>but Primo ended up on a date
with JR's sister Renee.</i>

01:01:47.287 --> 01:01:49.005
<i>And she tried that same bubblegum shit</i>

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.297
<i>she tried with Kite's little brother.</i>

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:05.810
<i>But shit went wrong.</i>

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:08.229
<i>And Primo ended up getting shot
in the face.</i>

01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:11.065
<i>But Primo was strong.</i>

01:02:11.144 --> 01:02:12.771
<i>He just spit out a couple of teeth</i>

01:02:12.854 --> 01:02:14.822
<i>and drove himself to the local doctor.</i>

01:04:53.473 --> 01:04:55.350
I understand how you feel
about your sister.

01:04:56.976 --> 01:05:00.071
And I do understand what death
can do to you, trust me I know.

01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:06.282
All I can tell you is from my experience.

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:11.199
When you react when you're emotional...

01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:13.998
you fuck shit up.

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:16.045
And it's not your present you fuck up,

01:05:16.788 --> 01:05:17.710
it's your future.

01:05:18.123 --> 01:05:19.500
And everything I've been doing?

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:21.422
My whole hustle...

01:05:22.043 --> 01:05:24.011
has been for our future.

01:05:30.677 --> 01:05:33.021
See, the thing is, OG, is this...

01:05:34.639 --> 01:05:35.811
it's friends,

01:05:37.976 --> 01:05:39.694
you know, you got your niggas
in the street...

01:05:41.563 --> 01:05:42.485
it's family.

01:05:44.524 --> 01:05:45.650
Family blood.

01:05:54.659 --> 01:05:55.876
That's my sister.

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:03.335
Sometimes, it's personal.

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:07.343
You know, one thing I realized,
you know,

01:06:07.422 --> 01:06:10.141
and I respect everything
you telling me, but...

01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:16.272
war ain't about who's right.

01:06:18.475 --> 01:06:19.897
Sometimes it's about who's left.

01:06:37.076 --> 01:06:38.828
<i>Primo knew this was a sticky situation</i>

01:06:38.912 --> 01:06:40.505
<i>because JR's sister was involved.</i>

01:06:40.705 --> 01:06:43.424
<i>He needed to tell his crew
to stand down until he spoke to me.</i>

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:45.673
<i>He didn't know that Renee
had already been killed.</i>

01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:47.257
<i>But his crew was like that.</i>

01:07:12.111 --> 01:07:13.533
We took care of that anyway.

01:07:13.738 --> 01:07:14.705
You know how we do.

01:07:15.114 --> 01:07:16.036
Honor up.

01:07:16.741 --> 01:07:17.663
Honor up.

01:07:17.784 --> 01:07:19.206
That's a fact, bro.

01:07:23.623 --> 01:07:24.545
Honor up.

01:07:57.490 --> 01:07:59.413
You telling me you scared
of these brothers?

01:07:59.492 --> 01:08:00.664
Fuck is up, niggas.

01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:17.264
Yo.

01:08:18.051 --> 01:08:18.974
Yo.

01:08:31.232 --> 01:08:32.198
You ain't killed the nigga?

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.611
Nah, nigga.

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:36.116
Figured I'd save him for you.

01:08:37.071 --> 01:08:38.368
It being your sister and all.

01:08:39.032 --> 01:08:40.533
Figured you might want
to do the honors.

01:08:42.243 --> 01:08:43.165
No!

01:08:43.368 --> 01:08:44.712
No, mother fucker!

01:08:46.205 --> 01:08:47.377
Whoa, whoa.

01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:53.050
Put your mask on now, nigga?

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:56.345
What, nigga? I ain't trying
to get blood on my face, nigga.

01:08:58.843 --> 01:08:59.719
No! Hold on!

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:35.636
You crazy.

01:09:36.714 --> 01:09:39.091
Hey, yes, girl. That shit was live.

01:09:39.384 --> 01:09:41.886
Yeah, we had such a good time.

01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:52.112
Yo, I don't like that shit, yo.

01:09:52.979 --> 01:09:55.403
That shit really bothers me.

01:09:55.483 --> 01:09:56.405
What?

01:09:56.693 --> 01:10:00.448
Talking English in one sentence then
the next sentence you jump to Spanish.

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:02.624
- Make it seem like you talk--
- I'm not talking about you.

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:04.451
- What's the problem?
- It seem like you talkin...

01:10:04.659 --> 01:10:06.912
The person you talking to
speaks English too.

01:10:06.994 --> 01:10:10.544
- Have the fucking conversation in English.
- This shit really got you buggin',

01:10:10.623 --> 01:10:12.466
like, I'm not even talking about you.

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:15.173
You need some weed or something,
what's the problem?

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:16.592
Oh, now I need some weed.

01:10:16.671 --> 01:10:19.925
A .45 on the table
and I should be smoking weed...

01:10:20.007 --> 01:10:23.807
- You ain't making no sense, man.
- Okay, whatever, like...

01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:28.812
Oh baby, you know,
I'm a little stressed about this shit.

01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:33.187
Well, it's gonna be all right, relax.

01:10:34.981 --> 01:10:38.235
I just wanna say thank you for, you know,
rolling with me, you know what I'm saying?

01:10:38.317 --> 01:10:39.534
'Cause...

01:10:40.194 --> 01:10:43.448
not a lot of bitches wouldn't even be
up here with a nigga in this situation.

01:10:43.531 --> 01:10:44.453
You know. So...

01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:47.786
Your low-stress style is bothering me, but

- You know I love you and I'm sorry.
- I love you too.

01:10:54.834 --> 01:10:56.051
You know I got your back.

01:10:56.753 --> 01:10:57.675

Man, I'm honorable,

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:26.229
And my sister?

01:17:27.726 --> 01:17:28.818

01:17:30.146 --> 01:17:32.274
This ain't her fault; this your fault.

01:17:32.439 --> 01:17:33.782
You wanna think about it like that.

01:17:34.525 --> 01:17:35.492
And that's a fact.

01:17:36.735 --> 01:17:39.534
Talking about your sister.
Don't ask me about that.

01:17:40.239 --> 01:17:41.411
I just now this, man.

01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:44.376
You got a lot of real estate

01:17:45.411 --> 01:17:46.333
for a buck-eighty.

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:51.713
You know what? That mother fucking

01:17:53.169 --> 01:17:55.297
Hey yo, CO,

01:17:55.379 --> 01:17:56.426
Please do.

01:17:57.715 --> 01:17:58.887
Fucking hate rats.

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:17.948
What up?

01:18:19.236 --> 01:18:20.488
What's happening? You looking good.

01:18:20.779 --> 01:18:22.281
Thank you. How you doing?

01:18:22.615 --> 01:18:25.084
I'm here.
I'm holding on, man. I'm holding on.

01:18:25.618 --> 01:18:26.540
You looking good.

01:18:26.619 --> 01:18:29.372
- I miss you.
- I miss you too, man. I really do.

01:18:30.289 --> 01:18:32.007
I got a little bit of bad news.

01:18:32.333 --> 01:18:34.882
I might have to be in here
for a little while,

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:36.303
but I'm definitely
gonna come out, baby.

01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:38.301
What you mean be in here
for a little while?

01:18:38.797 --> 01:18:39.889
- You know what--
- So what you saying?

01:18:39.965 --> 01:18:41.342
I told you, Mike's snitching.

01:18:41.425 --> 01:18:43.473
- Well, snitch on him.
- Come on, come on.

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:45.054
I got to find out what's going on.

01:18:45.137 --> 01:18:47.105
I'm not snitching.
I know what I signed up for.

01:18:47.306 --> 01:18:49.525
You know what I'm saying?
And that's just not honorable.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.567
I'm not doing that.

01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:52.232
So...

01:18:53.312 --> 01:18:54.985
I know you--
You better not be crying.

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:56.611
I told you everything's
gonna be all right.

01:18:57.608 --> 01:18:58.404
All right?

01:18:58.484 --> 01:19:01.078
You're telling me you're gonna stay here,
and I'm gonna be by myself?

01:19:01.153 --> 01:19:02.496
- I just don't get it.
- No,no.

01:19:02.905 --> 01:19:04.703
I'm not gonna--
I'm gonna make sure you good.

01:19:04.782 --> 01:19:06.079
You're never by yourself.

01:19:06.951 --> 01:19:09.955
I ain't nothing but a phone call away.
You never by yourself, babe.

01:19:11.497 --> 01:19:12.419
All right?

01:19:12.831 --> 01:19:15.425
Don't cry, man.
You look too pretty to be crying, man.

01:19:17.836 --> 01:19:19.930
Just think positive.
You got to think positive.

01:19:20.005 --> 01:19:21.052
It's gonna be all right.

01:19:21.465 --> 01:19:23.843
- All right'?
- All right.

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:26.808
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:19:26.887 --> 01:19:27.809
All right.

01:19:28.222 --> 01:19:30.099
<i>I hate how things went down with JR.</i>

01:19:30.933 --> 01:19:32.276
<i>He was prepared to do his time.</i>

01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:34.111
<i>He knew it came with the game.</i>

01:19:34.478 --> 01:19:35.400
<i>He was honorable.</i>

01:19:35.896 --> 01:19:36.897
<i>But it just so happened</i>

01:19:37.314 --> 01:19:40.409
<i>that they put that rat bastard
Mike in the same jail as O.</i>

01:19:41.318 --> 01:19:43.366
<i>Looks like JR might be coming home:</i>

01:19:43.862 --> 01:19:44.784
<i>No witnesses.</i>

01:19:51.078 --> 01:19:52.625
Get rid of this little snitch-ass nigga.

01:19:52.705 --> 01:19:54.423
Yeah! Yeah!

01:19:56.375 --> 01:19:58.924
<i>War ain't about who's right.</i>

01:19:59.586 --> 01:20:01.338
<i>Sometimes it's about who's left.</i>

01:20:03.048 --> 01:20:04.721
<i>But JR lost his sister.</i>

01:20:10.556 --> 01:20:11.899
<i>And I lost my OG.</i>

01:20:13.267 --> 01:20:14.894
<i>I miss talking to my OG.</i>

01:20:15.477 --> 01:20:18.731
<i>But at least I have the memories
of our conversations to reflect on.</i>

01:20:21.984 --> 01:20:23.782
<i>He was the most honorable dude I knew.</i>

01:20:24.403 --> 01:20:25.905
<i>And he still ended up dead.</i>

01:20:27.156 --> 01:20:28.999
<i>The problem with this game
is it's treacherous.</i>

01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:31.248
<i>And not everybody plays by the rules.</i>

01:20:33.245 --> 01:20:35.293
<i>And my advice to anyone watching this:</i>

01:20:35.456 --> 01:20:37.049
<i>always have morals and principles,</i>

01:20:37.666 --> 01:20:38.918
<i>play the game with honor,</i>

01:20:39.126 --> 01:20:40.594
<i>never look the other way,</i>

01:20:40.961 --> 01:20:42.383
<i>and apply it to a legal game.</i>

01:20:42.921 --> 01:20:44.844
<i>'Cause this life's not sustainable.</i>

01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:48.932
<i>And trust me,</i>

01:20:49.136 --> 01:20:50.103
<i>you'll make history.</i>

01:20:52.097 --> 01:20:54.020
<i>'Cause this game is over.</i>
