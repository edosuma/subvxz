00:06.272 --> 00:07.534
Gentlemen.

00:07.941 --> 00:11.342
Fill me with barbecue sauce
because I'm dumb as hell.

00:12.779 --> 00:14.371
Yeah, I know, Javier.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.854
Hey, Carl. Welcome to the barbecue.

01:02.929 --> 01:04.521
Okay, Carl, look into the camera...

01:04.596 --> 01:07.191
state your name,
and what you like best about me.

01:07.267 --> 01:10.566
Hey, zoom in on this. Happy Labor Day!

01:11.304 --> 01:13.772
- That was our one balloon.
- What do you got in there?

01:13.840 --> 01:16.240
I need it in this cooler.
My show's about to start.

01:16.309 --> 01:19.142
You don't want to hang out?
Look at what I got on the grill.

01:19.212 --> 01:20.941
What the hell is that?

01:21.014 --> 01:25.144
They're T-bones, Carl.
Yeah, the "T" stands for "tofu".

01:25.218 --> 01:26.776
Look at that cut of bean.

01:26.853 --> 01:29.651
Okay, have a crappy weekend.
Hope your house burns down.

01:29.722 --> 01:32.122
Carl, wait a minute.
Hang on, don't go. Look.

01:32.192 --> 01:35.889
- I got the real meat right here.
- All right, that's what I'm talking about!

01:35.962 --> 01:37.827
- Where'd you get that?
- At a farm.

01:37.897 --> 01:40.661
Shake, it would take all day
to smoke something that big.

01:40.733 --> 01:42.701
Smoke it? What are you smoking?

01:42.769 --> 01:47.001
'Cause I ain't slow-cooking jack.
We're flash-frying this mother.

01:47.707 --> 01:49.334
Carl, stand back.

01:50.643 --> 01:52.975
Is that batter? That's batter.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.308
- Carl, take it up.
- With pleasure.

01:57.550 --> 02:00.485
You take it up too high,
how am I gonna inject the cheese?

02:00.553 --> 02:02.544
- The cheese?
- Yes!

02:02.655 --> 02:04.680
What is that? Cheddar or Pepper Jack?

02:04.757 --> 02:07.157
- Both.
- You are the man!

02:07.227 --> 02:08.660
There's pork in here, too.

02:08.728 --> 02:12.494
See, I rolled it in ranch dressing
and then I force-fed it to her.

02:12.565 --> 02:14.999
How do you think she died?
Natural causes?

02:15.068 --> 02:17.764
All right, this is gonna be so good!

02:18.404 --> 02:20.804
Y'all go on ahead
and have your little heart attack.

02:20.874 --> 02:24.173
Meatwad and I are gonna have us
a healthy Labor Day, ain't that right?

02:24.244 --> 02:25.802
Yeah, I'll do that when I'm dead.

02:25.879 --> 02:28.575
- Inject me with some cheese.
- Submerge!

02:30.617 --> 02:32.312
It's gonna take a minute, Carl.

02:32.385 --> 02:36.014
We just gotta hope that the bowels
don't release after hitting the hot oil.

02:36.089 --> 02:39.183
While we're waiting,
does anybody want to throw the Frisbee?

02:39.259 --> 02:42.387
- Here. Yeah, go long.
- All right, I'm going long now.

02:42.462 --> 02:45.693
- Little further.
- How far? Over here?

02:45.765 --> 02:49.531
- Little further. Okay, whoa.
- All right, this is in the street now.

02:49.602 --> 02:51.001
Here we go.

02:51.638 --> 02:54.106
Oh, shoot! Almost.

02:55.275 --> 02:56.799
I'll get the ladder.

02:56.876 --> 03:00.505
She's ready.
Quick, wipe the oil off before the udder...

03:01.614 --> 03:04.276
- Great.
- Hey, no harm, no foul.

03:04.450 --> 03:07.817
- Plenty of cow left.
- What are you gonna do with all that oil?

03:07.887 --> 03:11.084
Well, I guess...
Gee, what will we do with a vat of hot oil?

03:11.157 --> 03:12.749
I'm gonna tip it over.

03:13.359 --> 03:14.690
We're not doing that.

03:14.761 --> 03:18.322
Look, relax.
I am respectful of my Earth Mother.

03:18.431 --> 03:20.558
- Now let's tip.
- You're not doing that, Shake.

03:20.633 --> 03:23.067
Look, that oil
needs to be disposed of properly.

03:23.136 --> 03:25.400
You know the river
is over 2 miles from here?

03:25.471 --> 03:27.336
The river is not where it goes.

03:27.407 --> 03:30.740
They have special places to take this,
and one is down the street.

03:30.810 --> 03:33.278
Thank you, Stephanie.
Why don't you go do your nails?

03:33.346 --> 03:34.643
The men are eating.

03:37.784 --> 03:40.048
Shake, I've given you a week.

03:40.119 --> 03:42.952
I've been calm, I've been nice,
I've been cool about this...

03:43.022 --> 03:45.490
but I want that fryer out of there today!

03:46.025 --> 03:47.549
Well, I'll do it...

03:47.627 --> 03:50.425
but wait till Rampin Up 46
hears about this.

03:50.496 --> 03:54.125
- Who's that?
- Hello! The chat room? I have a life.

03:58.471 --> 04:00.701
Hey, can I help you?

04:00.773 --> 04:02.900
Yeah, you can help me
pull this into your yard.

04:02.976 --> 04:05.274
Frylock don't want it in ours anymore.

04:06.246 --> 04:09.477
- No, we're not doing that.
- Clearly, we were...

04:09.616 --> 04:12.710
You see that large, bulbous gut you got?

04:12.819 --> 04:17.586
Imagine it on the inside.
It's filled with flash-fried cow and cheese.

04:17.656 --> 04:19.055
All right!

04:19.358 --> 04:22.123
I will help you and we will take it to...

04:22.195 --> 04:24.686
you know, a proper recycling facility.

04:24.831 --> 04:26.162
- Okay, you got that end?
- Yeah.

04:26.232 --> 04:28.359
Tip it over and run like hell.

04:28.568 --> 04:29.933
Frigging illegal.

04:31.904 --> 04:33.872
- Hey, where are you?
- He did it!

04:33.940 --> 04:35.567
Okay, fine. Yeah, run!

04:36.276 --> 04:39.245
Who's gonna arrest me?
The frigging trees?

04:42.181 --> 04:43.205
Oh, God.

04:51.190 --> 04:53.658
Wow, somebody should really get that.

04:56.829 --> 04:58.091
Somebody.

05:03.169 --> 05:04.466
I'll get it.

05:04.537 --> 05:06.505
- You got it. Okay.
- It's for you.

05:06.572 --> 05:08.403
- What is this?
- It's a summons, Shake.

05:08.474 --> 05:10.339
I know. I'm not dumb.

05:13.079 --> 05:16.981
- Can you read it to me, please?
- I guess you did dump that oil after all.

05:17.050 --> 05:20.315
Yes, I took care of it like you told me to.

05:20.386 --> 05:22.251
- In the woods.
- Come on, now.

05:22.355 --> 05:26.382
- You don't know that.
- Yeah, I do, because this is a ticket for it...

05:26.459 --> 05:28.393
- from the woods.
- From the woods?

05:28.461 --> 05:31.555
Yeah, from the woods? What the hell...

05:31.731 --> 05:34.427
- Have we always had this tree out here?
- Yes.

05:34.901 --> 05:38.462
I need to be more observant.
My wife's always on my back about it.

05:38.538 --> 05:40.506
Who is talking to you? Will you let us talk?

05:40.573 --> 05:43.235
Now get the gasoline.
It's blocking the yard.

05:44.977 --> 05:47.673
Well, looks like you got
another summons, Shake...

05:47.747 --> 05:50.113
and this time
it's for setting that big tree on fire.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.480
Just incredible, isn't it?

05:51.551 --> 05:54.042
I have yet to see a welfare check...

05:54.120 --> 05:57.112
but this is my second summons
in two days.

05:57.290 --> 05:59.485
Your tax dollars at work, Frylock.

05:59.559 --> 06:03.461
It also says here that you didn't appear
at your court date yesterday...

06:03.529 --> 06:06.930
- in the woods.
- Come on, they got nothing on me.

06:06.999 --> 06:08.296
What are they gonna do?

06:08.368 --> 06:10.666
March down here and get me
or something?

06:10.737 --> 06:11.897
Yes.

06:12.004 --> 06:14.734
- Why is it getting so dark out?
- Oh, my God.

06:14.807 --> 06:17.173
Me and my wife need to get out of here.

06:18.111 --> 06:20.011
No, I'm too young!

06:22.915 --> 06:24.780
Have you seen my wife?

06:25.284 --> 06:27.809
- Shake, are you in there?
- What are they gonna do to me?

06:27.887 --> 06:31.653
- I wish I could tell you, but I don't know.
- I don't care. It'll be fun to see.

06:31.724 --> 06:34.921
I can't go to the big house.
I'm not feeling too pretty.

06:34.994 --> 06:37.087
They'll tear me up on the inside.

06:37.497 --> 06:39.362
Is the defendant a juvenile?

06:39.432 --> 06:43.892
Daddy, you're back from your business trip
and you're sober.

06:43.970 --> 06:47.064
Mommy moved to the city
with Mommy's friend, Jerry...

06:47.140 --> 06:48.971
and he tried to hit me, Daddy.

06:49.041 --> 06:51.805
Not like you do. In an extra-mean way.

06:51.878 --> 06:55.041
- How old is the defendant?
- He's 21.

06:55.114 --> 06:56.911
- Twenty-one?
- Eighteen.

06:56.983 --> 06:59.850
- How about 18?
- Eighteen?

06:59.919 --> 07:03.218
- No, wait, 16.
- I think he's 16, okay?

07:03.289 --> 07:06.087
We shall find his age. Cut him in half!

07:06.159 --> 07:08.684
- Count his rings!
- Okay, I'm an adult!

07:08.761 --> 07:11.093
- It's fine.
- Can I get you to sign this sheet?

07:11.164 --> 07:14.793
Sign it? The sheet's already full... of hair.

07:14.867 --> 07:16.528
All right, I'll get another one.

07:16.602 --> 07:20.265
You're not gonna do this.
Don't do it. No! Oh, God!

07:20.673 --> 07:23.267
- That hurts so bad.
- Here, sign this sheet.

07:23.342 --> 07:24.809
- Anywhere or...
- Not on the hair.

07:24.877 --> 07:27.675
Look at me!
They've been using me as a Post-it note.

07:27.747 --> 07:31.581
- Frylock, you got to get me out of here.
- Get us both out of here! Come on.

07:31.651 --> 07:33.710
Wood court is now in session.

07:33.953 --> 07:37.116
If you do not have a lawyer,
this shrub will be appointed for you.

07:37.190 --> 07:39.681
Guilty! My clients plead guilty!

07:39.759 --> 07:41.283
Shut up! He's my lawyer.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.225
Frylock, help. You gotta help me.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.459
All right. I want to know the truth, though.
Did you do this?

07:46.532 --> 07:50.127
Frylock, come on. You know me.
How long have we known each other?

07:50.203 --> 07:51.227
You did it.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.432
Of course. But listen,
the point is that they don't know that.

07:54.507 --> 07:56.771
They can't prove it. They're frigging trees.

07:56.843 --> 07:59.710
Please note Exhibit A
on the wooden video.

07:59.779 --> 08:03.772
You will clearly see the accused
dumping the oil.

08:05.718 --> 08:06.707
Look at that.

08:06.786 --> 08:09.721
Frylock, I'm telling you,
that's not me in that video...

08:09.789 --> 08:12.121
'cause that's nothing.
There's nothing up there!

08:12.191 --> 08:13.488
What the hell... This is bark.

08:13.559 --> 08:15.925
Silence! Exhibit B.

08:16.362 --> 08:21.095
Advance the wooden video
to the accused setting fire to Big Ralph.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.962
Guilty as sin.

08:24.036 --> 08:26.163
- His name was Ralph?
- Shut up, Shake.

08:26.239 --> 08:28.764
If it would please the court,
my client would like to...

08:28.841 --> 08:32.004
- He's guilty!
- Man, what is that called?

08:32.078 --> 08:33.443
- You're guilty!
- He's guilty.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.879
- Just say you're guilty.
- No, not that.

08:35.948 --> 08:38.246
What do you... Something else.

08:39.885 --> 08:42.980
- It's, "Go to tree jail".
- It's tree jail for you.

08:43.054 --> 08:45.888
No, not that. Look, what do you call it...

08:45.992 --> 08:49.553
- when he wants to get out of this?
- That's the sweet release of death.

08:49.629 --> 08:53.588
Yeah, evisceration by a thousand branches
of a mighty oak.

08:53.666 --> 08:54.928
- Guilty.
- Guilty.

08:55.001 --> 08:56.366
Okay, can I have...

08:56.435 --> 08:59.131
Can we do a conference or something?

08:59.205 --> 09:01.139
I think we need to hire
another lawyer here.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.505
Typical. Filthy humans.

09:03.643 --> 09:07.545
- You have no respect for us trees.
- He ripped my arms off!

09:07.613 --> 09:10.309
- Shut up. I didn't rip them.
- Shake, you're making it worse.

09:10.383 --> 09:14.683
Go back to your strip malls
where values are king.

09:14.754 --> 09:18.349
Look, how do I just say,
"They did it, but they're sorry"?

09:19.792 --> 09:21.851
Hang on. Have you ever done it before?

09:21.928 --> 09:24.294
- I don't know.
- I've been on the bench for 100 years.

09:24.363 --> 09:28.424
- I'm not gonna look stupid, Ray.
- We know you've been there 100 years.

09:28.935 --> 09:30.926
- We all know that.
- Well, look it up.

09:31.003 --> 09:33.563
Like, no. You look it up.
You go get the book.

09:33.639 --> 09:37.006
I'm tired of getting the book.
I always have to get it.

09:37.076 --> 09:40.136
Okay, we don't know.

09:40.846 --> 09:42.677
We're trees.

09:43.482 --> 09:44.676
Wait.

09:44.884 --> 09:48.115
- Did he say that he did it?
- You did say that they did it?

09:48.187 --> 09:50.451
- They're sorry, but they did it.
- No.

09:50.523 --> 09:52.115
- You said they did it.
- Not exactly.

09:52.191 --> 09:55.592
Court stenographer,
please read the minutes back to me.

09:57.964 --> 10:02.128
So I'm now the stenographer.
When did that happen?

10:02.602 --> 10:04.763
All right, hold on. I'll play it like I am.

10:04.837 --> 10:07.567
- Come here.
- No need to tear it off to read it.

10:08.874 --> 10:10.842
Hang on. I think it's on the front.

10:10.910 --> 10:13.242
Would you check it again, before you...

10:13.679 --> 10:16.239
Wait. It was on the back.

10:16.315 --> 10:18.806
- Don't do...
- Here we are.

10:19.518 --> 10:22.487
I didn't write anything down.
I just drew some stuff.

10:23.389 --> 10:25.482
Look, I found the book, okay?

10:25.558 --> 10:27.685
And it says right here on Page 53...

10:27.760 --> 10:30.320
Paper! Made from trees!

10:30.396 --> 10:32.296
- Seize him!
- Seize him.

10:33.933 --> 10:35.332
Come on, let's go!

10:35.401 --> 10:37.665
Mighty greedy there, Matlock.

10:37.737 --> 10:40.137
Nice of you to wait until now to do that.

10:40.206 --> 10:42.333
You know,
you're lucky trees are so stupid.

10:42.408 --> 10:44.239
You're both guilty as hell. You know that.

10:44.310 --> 10:47.074
Frylock, that was never proven
in the wood court.

10:47.146 --> 10:50.047
We are gonna find
the real person who did this.

10:50.316 --> 10:53.479
And I am on a quest...

10:53.552 --> 10:55.543
to find the person that did...

10:59.058 --> 11:00.923
What, are you highballing us?

11:00.993 --> 11:03.689
I said I want it level. I don't want a ramp.

11:04.030 --> 11:06.328
Get working, turkey. Come on.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.299
And level. Level.

11:08.367 --> 11:11.768
- Who's paying for all this?
- Get in the closet. Hit the lights.
