<i>Arriving passengers!</i>

01:40.341 --> 01:42.842
<i>Please have your passport</i>

01:42.876 --> 01:45.445
<i>or naturalization</i>
<i>papers handy.</i>

01:51.252 --> 01:53.453
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

01:53.487 --> 01:56.455
- Passport?
- <i>...Welcome to Belfast.</i>

01:57.557 --> 01:59.089
And you?

01:59.123 --> 02:01.023
Good to be home, mate.

02:02.792 --> 02:04.859
Purpose of your visit,
Mr. Thompson?

02:04.893 --> 02:07.094
To bury my father

02:07.129 --> 02:09.496
in the land of his birth.

02:09.531 --> 02:12.098
Repatriation document
and death certificate.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.736
Accident, was it?

02:16.770 --> 02:18.637
Natural causes.

02:18.671 --> 02:20.638
Your hand.

02:21.807 --> 02:23.874
Got caught in the wrong cookie jar.

02:25.309 --> 02:27.811
They have cookie jars here,
don't they?

02:31.282 --> 02:34.383
Welcome to the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland.

02:36.285 --> 02:38.753
God save his majesty George V.

02:39.688 --> 02:41.155
Passport.

02:43.391 --> 02:44.988
Thank you, ma'am.

02:54.899 --> 02:57.533
Mr.Thompson arrived safely.

02:58.868 --> 03:00.902
It's almost miraculous, isn't it?

03:00.937 --> 03:03.272
I beg your pardon?

03:03.306 --> 03:07.008
He was standing right here
and then six days later.

03:07.042 --> 03:09.310
They're called
steamships, Katy.

03:09.345 --> 03:12.579
Beg pardon, ma'am, but Emily
refuses to get out of bed.

03:12.614 --> 03:14.748
- Did you draw the bath?
- Yes ma'am.

03:14.783 --> 03:17.351
Get Teddy started, please.

03:21.122 --> 03:24.089
You can't be sleeping
beauty with your eyes open.

03:24.124 --> 03:27.592
- I can't move.
- I'm afraid you must.

03:27.626 --> 03:30.961
All the fair princes
are out of doors today.

03:34.231 --> 03:36.666
Are you still
not feeling well?

03:36.700 --> 03:39.735
I can't move my legs.

03:45.407 --> 03:48.609
- Can you feel that?
- I don't know.

03:51.412 --> 03:53.880
Wiggle your toes,
sweetheart.

03:55.082 --> 03:58.183
- Emily, wiggle your toes!
- I am.

03:59.286 --> 04:02.120
Lilian! Katy!

04:02.154 --> 04:04.488
- Katy!
- Ma'am.

04:04.523 --> 04:07.457
Call Dr. Surran.
Have him come straightaway.

04:09.360 --> 04:11.994
What are you
staring at? Go.

04:13.564 --> 04:16.598
- Mommy.
- It's nothing, <i>cushla.</i>

04:16.632 --> 04:19.301
- Mama.
- It's nothing now.

04:19.334 --> 04:23.271
- It's nothing at all.
- Mama.

04:23.305 --> 04:26.473
Jimmy Darmody,

04:26.507 --> 04:28.575
George Remus.

04:29.810 --> 04:31.677
How do you do, sir?

04:31.712 --> 04:33.446
How are ya?

04:36.316 --> 04:38.383
- You always meet out of your home?
- For now.

04:38.418 --> 04:40.452
I'm looking for an office.

04:42.554 --> 04:44.822
Remus enjoys a trip to the shore.

04:50.327 --> 04:53.328
I understand you have
government-bonded whiskey to sell.

04:55.432 --> 04:58.834
- You speak for the group?
- In Atlantic City he does.

04:58.868 --> 05:01.003
Then yes.

05:03.139 --> 05:05.773
It turns out we've got a lot
of sick people in this town.

05:05.808 --> 05:07.441
Practically an epidemic.

05:07.476 --> 05:09.177
Remus has permits

05:09.211 --> 05:11.212
that allow him to sell this alcohol

05:11.246 --> 05:13.614
to legitimate drug companies only.

05:15.283 --> 05:19.252
However, once the alcohol
is sold to a sanctioned buyer,

05:19.287 --> 05:21.421
what happens when
it's on the truck

05:21.455 --> 05:23.256
is not Remus's
responsibility.

05:23.290 --> 05:26.258
So how might we learn
where to find

05:26.293 --> 05:29.661
- Remus's trucks?
- That'll cost you.

05:29.695 --> 05:31.662
<i>The five of us</i>
<i>are willin' to kick in</i>

05:31.697 --> 05:34.865
- 60 grand a piece.
- To start.

05:34.899 --> 05:38.001
300 grand for 5,000 cases?

05:38.036 --> 05:39.536
But it's gotta be
the bona fide.

05:39.570 --> 05:41.471
Remus needs the money upfront.

05:42.572 --> 05:45.673
And this weekend's
on you, correct?

05:45.707 --> 05:48.508
Yeah. You're an honored guest.
Whatever you like.

05:50.010 --> 05:52.612
- You'll get word from my associate.
- All right.

05:52.646 --> 05:55.014
Remus is finished.

05:55.048 --> 05:58.185
Just give us a minute.

06:10.331 --> 06:13.165
300 big ones' worth of
out-of-the-crate liquor.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.200
We do things right,

06:15.235 --> 06:17.102
it'll be worth three million.

06:17.136 --> 06:19.037
So we don't do things wrong.

06:21.807 --> 06:26.310
At the risk of being
a fly in the ointment...

06:26.378 --> 06:29.313
Manny Horvitz in Philly--

06:29.347 --> 06:32.149
still <i>cafone</i> is still
noodging us for his money.

06:32.183 --> 06:33.718
Yeah, fuck him already.

06:33.752 --> 06:36.320
Or pay him
what you owe.

06:36.354 --> 06:38.288
You could cut him in
as a partner.

06:38.322 --> 06:41.023
And what's second prize
for being an asshole?

06:42.692 --> 06:44.826
- I'll take care of it.
- <i>He's no milksop.</i>

06:44.860 --> 06:46.661
I said I'd take care of it.

06:46.695 --> 06:48.996
You're the grand poobah.

06:50.601 --> 06:53.636
<i>- Then it's settled.</i>
<i>- Jersey city.</i>

06:54.636 --> 06:56.636
***

06:56.871 --> 06:59.606
Yeah? We got
the good seats.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.807
He'll plow a field
with that frenchy.

07:01.842 --> 07:04.376
- Blood all over the canvas.
- Why don't you come along?

07:04.411 --> 07:07.079
- We booked a suite at the Fairmont.
- Two nights in Jersey city?

07:07.113 --> 07:08.780
A.R.'s takin' a lot
of side action.

07:08.814 --> 07:12.016
- I'm gonna listen on the wireless.
- What the hell for?

07:12.050 --> 07:14.285
Darmody wants to see
what all the fuss is about.

07:14.319 --> 07:16.787
Might as well read a book.

07:42.242 --> 07:44.143
You're an American.

07:44.177 --> 07:45.844
Yes.

07:45.878 --> 07:48.113
May I ask you
a question?

07:49.915 --> 07:52.516
Where do you put
Carpentier's prospects?

07:52.551 --> 07:54.485
Dempsey's got
13 lbs on him.

07:54.519 --> 07:57.087
Ah, but the frenchman,
he's a puncher.

07:57.121 --> 07:59.389
Knocked out Britain's best
in 74 seconds.

07:59.423 --> 08:01.357
Beckett?
He's a bum.

08:01.392 --> 08:04.760
There's no call now to
be casting aspersions.

08:11.867 --> 08:13.501
Mr. Thompson.

08:13.535 --> 08:16.236
Mr. McGarrigle.
Thanks for coming here.

08:16.271 --> 08:19.439
I understand misfortune's
caught up with you.

08:19.473 --> 08:21.607
Doesn't it with everyone?

08:21.642 --> 08:24.810
A long way to come
to bury the dead.

08:31.884 --> 08:34.385
Bleedin' Jesus!

08:34.419 --> 08:35.753
Thompson submachine guns.

08:35.788 --> 08:37.922
One of these can finish
off an entire platoon

08:37.956 --> 08:39.823
in the time it takes to fry an egg.

08:41.993 --> 08:44.394
My donation to the rebellion.

08:44.429 --> 08:46.796
How many do you have there?

08:46.830 --> 08:50.600
A dozen, plus a drum
magazine for each.

08:52.502 --> 08:54.303
Don't say you don't need them.

08:55.771 --> 08:57.439
100 might make
a difference.

08:57.473 --> 08:59.107
There are 3,000
sitting in the cellar

08:59.141 --> 09:00.808
of the Atlantic City armory.

09:05.313 --> 09:08.047
And what do you want
for them, Mr. Thompson?

09:08.082 --> 09:10.950
Irish whiskey--
all I can get.

09:14.687 --> 09:17.722
And that's the kind
of man you bring me?

09:20.092 --> 09:22.293
I was good enough
for you in Atlantic City.

09:24.129 --> 09:26.497
- I'll present it to the leadership.
- I thought you wanted weapons.

09:26.531 --> 09:28.832
It's naught but truth,
Mr. McGarrigle.

09:28.866 --> 09:31.200
- Are you interested or not?
- It'll have to be discussed.

09:31.235 --> 09:33.169
Then bring me to
the man in charge.

09:33.203 --> 09:36.538
We'll tend to our affairs in our own
way if it's all the same to you.

09:39.909 --> 09:42.143
You'll be sent word.

09:49.584 --> 09:51.751
What the fuck
was that about?

09:51.785 --> 09:55.053
He's a flinty old geezer,
make no mistake.

09:56.622 --> 09:58.923
Close it up.

10:02.327 --> 10:04.795
<i>Grant this mercy, o lord,</i>

10:04.830 --> 10:08.665
we beseech thee,
to thy servant departed,

10:08.700 --> 10:11.502
<i>that he may not receive</i>
<i>in punishment</i>

10:11.536 --> 10:15.438
<i>the requital of his deeds</i>
<i>who in desire</i>

10:15.472 --> 10:17.440
<i>did keep thy will,</i>

10:17.474 --> 10:20.009
and as the true faith here

10:20.043 --> 10:22.845
united him to the company
of the faithful,

10:22.880 --> 10:26.582
so may thy mercy
unite him above

10:26.616 --> 10:29.416
<i>to the choirs of angels,</i>

10:29.451 --> 10:32.414
<i>through Jesus Christ</i>
<i>our lord.</i>

10:32.448 --> 10:34.682
- <i>Amen.</i>
- Amen.

10:34.717 --> 10:37.452
<i>Eternal rest grant</i>
<i>unto him, o lord.</i>

10:37.486 --> 10:40.188
And let perpetual light
shine upon him.

10:40.223 --> 10:42.891
- May he rest in peace.
- Amen.

10:42.925 --> 10:46.360
<i>May his soul,</i>
<i>through the mercy of God,</i>

10:46.395 --> 10:49.530
- rest in peace.
- Amen.

10:54.402 --> 10:56.569
See how I'm moving
your foot?

10:58.372 --> 11:00.172
Now you do it.

11:01.974 --> 11:03.374
Are you trying?

11:06.978 --> 11:08.812
Very good, Emily.

11:14.018 --> 11:15.818
Does Teddy also
sleep in this room?

11:15.853 --> 11:17.854
Yes.

11:17.888 --> 11:20.089
Take him out.
Quickly.

11:20.123 --> 11:22.924
I'll need to examine him too.

11:22.959 --> 11:25.527
- What's the diagnosis?
- Do as I say.

11:27.796 --> 11:30.264
Lilian, take Teddy
downstairs.

11:30.299 --> 11:31.365
No!

11:31.400 --> 11:34.334
- Take him out of the house.
- Where?

11:34.369 --> 11:36.869
It doesn't matter.
The porch.

11:36.903 --> 11:38.771
Now.

11:43.409 --> 11:46.177
It's polio, isn't it?

11:46.211 --> 11:47.711
There's no point
in speculating.

11:47.746 --> 11:50.914
Is that meant
to soothe me?

11:51.949 --> 11:53.950
She has all the symptoms.

11:55.586 --> 11:58.487
We'll need to quarantine her at the
children's hospital immediately.

12:01.190 --> 12:03.658
Mrs. Schroeder?

12:06.362 --> 12:08.996
I can't drive.

12:09.064 --> 12:12.032
You'll have to take us please.

12:30.348 --> 12:32.982
Easy with those plates.

12:34.951 --> 12:37.519
Boy, I'm talking to you.

12:37.554 --> 12:40.321
- I have a name.
- And I don't have to remember it.

12:40.356 --> 12:43.591
- Now do as you're told.
- <i>Lunch, 10 minutes!</i>

12:54.334 --> 12:56.602
Thanks.

13:18.255 --> 13:21.690
I ever bite you, Frie?

13:21.724 --> 13:24.225
Huh?

13:24.259 --> 13:27.294
- No. - Then why are you
feeding me dog food?

13:27.328 --> 13:30.096
I serve what they tell me to serve.

13:30.131 --> 13:34.267
I seen room-service leftovers
come back all day--

13:34.301 --> 13:37.603
chicken,
mashed potatoes,

13:37.637 --> 13:39.971
chocolate pudding.
Why don't you serve that?

13:40.006 --> 13:42.907
Now you been here near a week, Purnsley.
You know the rules.

13:42.941 --> 13:45.609
I surely do.
Rules say

13:45.643 --> 13:49.212
we ain't good enough to eat what
some cracker throw in the trash.

13:49.247 --> 13:52.649
- <i>Taste good to me.</i>
- Look at you.

13:52.683 --> 13:56.719
Uncle Toms--
gobble up this slop

13:56.753 --> 13:59.855
and say "thank you, sir"
for the privilege.

13:59.889 --> 14:01.656
Be thankful you've
got a job, friend.

14:01.691 --> 14:03.558
- <i>Right.</i>
- <i>12 hours a day?</i>

14:03.625 --> 14:06.093
Six days a week?

14:06.127 --> 14:08.828
I been in jails don't
work you this hard.

14:08.862 --> 14:10.396
<i>He's right about that.</i>

14:10.430 --> 14:13.265
- Purnsley: <i>And they feed you better too.</i>
- I bet he right about that too.

14:13.299 --> 14:16.334
- You boys have a problem?
- No sir.

14:16.369 --> 14:19.203
Just discussin' what passes
for food around here.

14:19.237 --> 14:23.372
- Your name is Purnsley.
- That's right, <i>chief.</i>

14:23.406 --> 14:27.443
Mr. Purnsley--
<i>lord</i> Purnsley,

14:27.477 --> 14:30.717
your great celestial majesty,

14:30.751 --> 14:32.952
one more word out of you
and you're fired.

14:32.986 --> 14:36.221
Now finish your lunch, or don't,

14:36.256 --> 14:39.424
and get back to work--
all of you.

14:46.398 --> 14:48.699
You heard the man.

14:48.733 --> 14:50.900
Eat it up.

14:52.769 --> 14:54.637
Iodine is prepared, doctor.

14:54.671 --> 14:57.406
- <i>Very good.</i>
- <i>Now just hold my hand.</i>

14:57.440 --> 15:00.008
You're going to feel
something a little bit cold.

15:00.042 --> 15:03.578
It's nothing.
They're just preparing you.

15:07.315 --> 15:09.717
<i>Is he going to give</i>
<i>her an injection?</i>

15:09.751 --> 15:12.352
She can't stand needles.

15:12.886 --> 15:14.853
It's called a spinal tap.

15:14.888 --> 15:17.522
The syringe will collect
cerebrospinal fluid

15:17.556 --> 15:20.225
which will allow us
to confirm the disease.

15:20.259 --> 15:24.161
She's in good hands. Dr. Holt's
an authority on infantile paralysis.

15:25.296 --> 15:27.397
- Mama!
- Nurse.

15:27.432 --> 15:29.432
I'll go in and hold her.
It'll calm her down.

15:29.466 --> 15:32.067
That's out of the question.
Polio is highly contagious.

15:32.101 --> 15:34.736
- I don't care what happens to me.

15:34.771 --> 15:37.339
Care about the people
you come in contact with.

15:38.608 --> 15:41.610
Mommy! I want--

15:41.644 --> 15:43.611
It's better if you don't look.

15:47.582 --> 15:49.883
- <i>Mommy!</i>
- Oh.

15:50.852 --> 15:54.354
<i>Mama.</i>

15:58.558 --> 16:01.793
Your toenails
are like talons.

16:01.827 --> 16:05.196
So you're saying
I'm like an eagle.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.366
They're rather
unpleasant birds,

16:09.434 --> 16:11.901
if you know anything
about their habits.

16:17.140 --> 16:18.640
Cozy...

16:18.674 --> 16:21.776
You, me and
Nelson van Alden.

16:24.547 --> 16:27.648
Does Enoch Thompson
strike you as a murderer?

16:27.683 --> 16:30.984
<i>You may as well be reading</i>
<i>the latest "Black Mask."</i>

16:32.386 --> 16:34.821
Someone sends a gunman
from Chicago to kill him,

16:34.855 --> 16:37.590
he sits in his office
and cracks jokes.

16:37.624 --> 16:40.359
<i>He's dirty up to his elbows.</i>
<i>We already know that.</i>

16:40.393 --> 16:42.661
But the stuff Van Alden's
got in there?

16:42.695 --> 16:44.863
These prohis
aren't real lawmen.

16:44.897 --> 16:46.998
They're katzenjammer cops.

16:47.032 --> 16:49.833
You just made that up,
didn't you?

16:49.868 --> 16:53.136
He's got Thompson ordering
12 homicides with no proof.

16:53.170 --> 16:55.638
Including his
mistress's husband.

16:55.838 --> 16:57.638
Schroeder?

16:58.108 --> 17:00.042
<i>He was a bootlegger.</i>

17:00.076 --> 17:02.377
According to Nucky Thompson.

17:04.680 --> 17:06.914
We already have a case.

17:06.949 --> 17:09.383
Why even put Van Alden
on the stand?

17:09.417 --> 17:11.785
He'll be handy for the
Volstead violations.

17:11.819 --> 17:13.987
We'll rehearse him on those.

17:14.021 --> 17:17.589
And keep him away from small
children and nursing mothers.

17:17.624 --> 17:19.992
Good girl.

17:24.663 --> 17:27.565
I'm your boss, Clifford.

17:30.902 --> 17:33.436
I went to a funeral today.

17:33.471 --> 17:35.538
Nucky Thompson's father.

17:35.573 --> 17:37.773
His father is being
buried in Belfast.

17:37.808 --> 17:40.342
That's right.
You gave him permission to travel.

17:40.377 --> 17:43.212
But his brother the sheriff

17:43.246 --> 17:45.680
put someone in the ground
here this morning.

17:48.684 --> 17:50.551
Why didn't you
mention this earlier?

17:55.222 --> 17:58.558
- You wanted to sleep with me first.
- <i>Hell's bells, Esther.</i>

17:58.592 --> 18:00.660
It's hard enough to get
your attention on a good day.

18:00.694 --> 18:02.361
Invite the sheriff in
for questioning.

18:02.395 --> 18:04.663
We tried that, remember?
He ignored us.

18:04.731 --> 18:07.665
His deputy then.
I want some answers.

18:12.103 --> 18:15.639
Belfast-- God only knows
what he's doing over there.

18:33.556 --> 18:36.390
50 rounds per magazine,
.45 caliber.

18:36.425 --> 18:39.960
<i>They called it a trench broom.</i>
<i>You can see why.</i>

18:39.961 --> 18:43.429
A few thousand of these and we'd
blaze a path to Buckingham Palace.

18:43.464 --> 18:45.598
They called it  <i>and you invented it, </i>
<i>Mr. Thompson? See why.</i>

18:45.632 --> 18:48.667
- Excuse me?
- The Thompson gun?

18:48.701 --> 18:51.102
No.
Just a happy coincidence.

18:51.136 --> 18:53.304
Well, how'd you come to
have so many of them?

18:53.371 --> 18:56.707
They're American-made.
I'm an American.

19:06.682 --> 19:11.318
- <i>You missed the fireworks.</i>
- Gave the clock a proper thrashing.

19:11.352 --> 19:14.087
Nothing stops you
making merry, huh, Daniel?

19:14.122 --> 19:16.589
No, John, we'll all
be dead long enough.

19:16.624 --> 19:17.991
You've news.
Let's hear it.

19:18.025 --> 19:20.660
The English have offered a truce.

19:20.694 --> 19:23.462
De Valera's traveling
to London to negotiate.

19:23.497 --> 19:25.531
- For what?
- They're offering a free state.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.300
That's not independence.

19:27.301 --> 19:28.233
Would you not even
hear their proposal?

19:28.234 --> 19:29.567
We'd still be a bloody dominion.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.969
It's enough for De Valera
to sit down.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.638
"To the bitter end,"
wasn't that the oath?

19:34.673 --> 19:36.241
<i>Who's to say we </i>
<i>haven't reached it?</i>

19:36.242 --> 19:37.074
Is that what you think?

19:37.875 --> 19:39.576
I think there's blood
on the ground

19:39.610 --> 19:41.878
sufficient for your lifetime
and mine, Patrick.

19:41.912 --> 19:44.213
<i>I'll keep fighting</i>
<i>if I must,</i>

19:44.248 --> 19:46.382
<i>and make peace</i>
<i>if it's wise.</i>

19:57.225 --> 20:00.627
His youngest was killed
in action last month.

20:00.662 --> 20:03.530
Shot square
between the eyes.

20:06.967 --> 20:10.869
Shall we go for a drink?
I know quiet little place

20:21.312 --> 20:22.712
<i>Yes?</i>

20:26.183 --> 20:28.451
Sorry?

20:28.485 --> 20:30.953
You're thinking something.

20:30.987 --> 20:33.255
Let's hear it.

20:34.223 --> 20:35.924
Hmm.

20:35.958 --> 20:38.727
At Babette's last week.

20:38.761 --> 20:40.996
With Doyle?
That was just a gag.

20:41.030 --> 20:42.998
Besides, it'll keep him in line.

20:43.032 --> 20:45.567
That's not what I meant.

20:47.003 --> 20:49.671
You said a nice girl

20:49.705 --> 20:52.005
and I would settle down.

20:52.039 --> 20:54.173
You will.

20:54.208 --> 20:57.409
You'll see.

21:02.514 --> 21:04.949
That's them.

21:06.417 --> 21:09.085
- You're my friend.
- Huh?

21:09.120 --> 21:10.987
You're my friend.

21:11.021 --> 21:12.888
You know I am.

21:12.923 --> 21:15.791
Then why did you
make fun of me?

21:16.826 --> 21:19.794
Richard, I wasn't.

21:19.829 --> 21:22.463
<i>Darmody here?</i>
Yeah!

21:32.573 --> 21:35.808
- Can I call you Waxey?
- Most people do.

21:35.842 --> 21:38.277
Is that short
for something

21:38.311 --> 21:40.079
or is it just
a nickname?

21:42.181 --> 21:44.215
You mining for
coal in there?

21:44.250 --> 21:46.016
A piece of meat's stuck.

21:46.050 --> 21:48.585
You're in company, Alfie.

21:50.387 --> 21:53.556
So I understand we have
someone in common.

21:53.590 --> 21:55.624
- Manny Horvitz.
- Munya.

21:55.659 --> 21:58.727
The man works
with animals.

21:58.761 --> 22:01.862
- He fits right in.
- Great minds think alike.

22:01.897 --> 22:05.699
And what else can you
offer besides flattery?

22:05.733 --> 22:08.068
I was thinking
information.

22:08.102 --> 22:10.570
You lost two men
last month.

22:10.604 --> 22:12.438
Herman Kaufman
disappeared

22:12.472 --> 22:15.807
- during a hijacking outside Philly.
- Nathan Klein.

22:15.875 --> 22:19.144
Raccoon chewed off his face
before they found him.

22:22.047 --> 22:24.949
I'm only saying.

22:24.983 --> 22:27.551
Manny did the shooting.

22:27.585 --> 22:29.519
You know this how?

22:29.553 --> 22:33.087
- I was standing next to him.
- And there was nothing you could do?

22:33.122 --> 22:35.756
He didn't ask permission.

22:38.326 --> 22:40.627
And Herman?
What became of him?

22:40.661 --> 22:44.731
I'd be careful about
where I order my cutlets.

22:47.367 --> 22:49.201
You going to offer me a drink?

22:49.236 --> 22:51.704
Of course.

22:56.175 --> 22:59.077
Last time I come here,
I deal with Nucky Thompson.

22:59.111 --> 23:00.812
From this point on,
you deal with me.

23:00.846 --> 23:04.148
I'll treat you right.
Thank you.

23:07.152 --> 23:11.955
A.C., Philadelphia, we can do
big things together, Waxey.

23:11.990 --> 23:16.959
First, Alfred's gonna take care of
some business for me back home.

23:16.994 --> 23:19.929
Unpaid bill at the butcher's.

23:19.963 --> 23:23.131
<i>Manny Horvitz</i>
<i>is a dead man.</i>

23:23.166 --> 23:26.067
So before we go
any further,

23:26.101 --> 23:28.736
you need to tell me
that's a problem.

23:28.770 --> 23:30.671
Maybe.

23:30.705 --> 23:33.440
But it's not mine.

23:39.045 --> 23:41.347
To the lost.

24:18.845 --> 24:22.981
Is Emily going
to die like daddy?

24:23.015 --> 24:25.783
What? No!

24:25.818 --> 24:28.786
And you mustn't
say that again!

24:28.820 --> 24:31.488
I'm sorry.

24:34.725 --> 24:37.925
Pauline,
where are you going?

24:37.960 --> 24:39.727
I'm sorry, ma'am.

24:39.761 --> 24:43.095
We're taking
every precaution.

24:43.130 --> 24:45.964
I have my own children
to worry about.

25:10.689 --> 25:12.923
<i>Slainte.</i>

25:16.794 --> 25:19.228
- Well?
- Worth the trip.

25:19.263 --> 25:23.398
Time was we were distilling
two million gallons a year.

25:23.433 --> 25:25.767
Lord knows I drank my share.

25:25.801 --> 25:28.169
The rebellion put a stop
to exporting to England?

25:28.203 --> 25:30.471
That was the blow.
Then the local economy.

25:30.505 --> 25:33.373
But the final name
was your prohibition.

25:33.407 --> 25:36.409
America was more than
80% of my foreign sales.

25:36.443 --> 25:40.245
The Fitzgeralds have run this
distillery for 90 years.

25:40.279 --> 25:42.513
I'm sorry for your trouble.

25:42.548 --> 25:44.749
It's only money,
I suppose.

25:44.750 --> 25:47.185
I have my health
and I have my family.

25:49.088 --> 25:51.822
All these cases are
filled with whiskey?

25:51.856 --> 25:54.691
Every one.

25:54.726 --> 25:57.861
Would you consider giving
10,000 cases on consignment?

26:00.131 --> 26:02.999
If there's peace,
I'll be back in business

26:03.034 --> 26:05.969
and we can speak again
about making a deal.

26:06.003 --> 26:08.371
When would that be?

26:08.406 --> 26:10.907
They say december
at the earliest.

26:12.277 --> 26:15.145
Unfortunately that time
frame don't help me.

26:15.180 --> 26:19.715
My regrets.
But as it stands now--

26:19.750 --> 26:23.718
- You've no use for machine guns.
- I'll not go against John.

26:23.752 --> 26:26.085
He's brought us
this far

26:26.120 --> 26:29.054
and paid for it with his
own blood along the way.

26:33.557 --> 26:36.525
And be here promptly
next time you're called.

26:42.965 --> 26:46.100
<i>Come on, let's go,</i>
<i>get those out of here.</i>

26:49.404 --> 26:52.139
<i>Still waiting for delivery on</i>
<i>New York street.</i>

26:52.173 --> 26:56.043
Deputy Halloran,
Esther Randolph.

26:56.077 --> 26:57.578
Thank you very
much for coming in.

26:59.647 --> 27:01.748
- That's a heck of a thing.
- What's next?

27:01.782 --> 27:04.383
- Horseless carriages?
- They already got those.

27:04.417 --> 27:07.084
Have a seat.

27:13.391 --> 27:16.660
We've asked the sheriff
to speak with us as well.

27:16.694 --> 27:19.562
- He seems awfully busy.
- Eli?

27:19.596 --> 27:23.932
- His father just died.
- And you were at the funeral.

27:23.966 --> 27:25.333
Well sure.

27:25.367 --> 27:27.167
Eli's my friend.

27:27.202 --> 27:29.970
- He's also your boss.
- <i>Just make things complicated.</i>

27:30.004 --> 27:31.871
How do you mean?

27:32.071 --> 27:34.171
Someone's friend, you can
tell them anything,

27:34.172 --> 27:36.240
even our tell them
deepest secrets.

27:36.443 --> 27:39.144
But when someone's
your boss--

27:39.178 --> 27:42.780
there're all sorts of subjects
you need to keep away from.

27:42.815 --> 27:45.882
Are you two married
or something?

27:47.285 --> 27:49.453
- So why did your boss--
- Friend.

27:49.487 --> 27:52.489
<i>--Have you ousted as sheriff</i>
<i>after last year's election?</i>

27:52.523 --> 27:54.524
Eli had nothing
to do with that.

27:54.558 --> 27:56.692
Because his brother makes all
the decisions. Correct

27:56.693 --> 27:58.794
well...

27:58.829 --> 28:01.363
Nucky's the boss.

28:01.397 --> 28:04.098
- The boss of Eli.
- The boss of you.

28:04.133 --> 28:07.134
- Except...
- It seems that some people here

28:07.169 --> 28:09.302
are fed up with getting
bossed around.

28:10.170 --> 28:12.004
I stay out of all that.

28:12.038 --> 28:14.439
I patrol the boardwalk,
keep the peace.

28:14.474 --> 28:18.076
Were you keeping the peace
on January 19th, 1920?

28:18.111 --> 28:20.979
If I was working,
then yeah.

28:21.014 --> 28:23.682
You were working.
You and your friend Eli

28:23.716 --> 28:27.017
responded to domestic disturbance
regarding a Hans Schroeder.

28:28.887 --> 28:33.256
- Who?
- Hans Peter Schroeder.

28:33.290 --> 28:35.491
I thought this was
about election rigging.

28:35.559 --> 28:37.293
Did we say it wasn't?

28:37.327 --> 28:39.462
Well, that fella had
nothing to do with that.

28:39.463 --> 28:40.796
So you do know who he was?

28:40.997 --> 28:43.965
I would have
to check the files.

28:43.999 --> 28:45.967
Oh.
You have files.

28:46.001 --> 28:48.936
Tourist town,
people come and go.

28:48.970 --> 28:52.038
But this particular person,
he just went.

28:53.607 --> 28:56.175
Remember now, deputy?

28:57.144 --> 28:59.178
We're not after you.

28:59.245 --> 29:01.513
We're after the men
who boss you around.

29:01.547 --> 29:04.081
And we're prepared to do
a lot for our friends.

29:04.116 --> 29:06.817
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:06.851 --> 29:08.451
But I know the law.

29:08.486 --> 29:11.387
And I don't have to go on sitting
here if I don't want to.

29:14.691 --> 29:16.558
Do I?

29:16.592 --> 29:19.160
Thank you for giving us your time.

29:19.194 --> 29:21.662
We'll be sure to let
sheriff Thompson know

29:21.696 --> 29:24.131
that you stood up for him.

29:37.610 --> 29:39.511
<i>Hey, do you ink</i>
<i>you can help me</i>

29:39.545 --> 29:41.413
<i>with this sack</i>
<i>of Philly mail?</i>

29:54.125 --> 29:56.193
You stroll back here
on your own some?

29:56.227 --> 30:00.229
I thought you said anytime
I need to talk...

30:05.300 --> 30:08.000
Mr. White.

30:09.569 --> 30:12.069
You don't meat me, we had
our little fras, huh?

30:12.169 --> 30:14.369
We got off on the
wambly foot, is all.

30:14.538 --> 30:17.539
- We copacetic now.
- Sweet as crackerjack.

30:17.810 --> 30:22.913
Hm. Here in my town,
job in a fine hotel;

30:23.147 --> 30:25.916
end of summer you go back to Baltimore

30:25.950 --> 30:27.784
with a plug of green in the pocket,

30:27.819 --> 30:30.287
a little gold in your mouth.

30:30.321 --> 30:32.723
All turn out for the best.

30:32.758 --> 30:34.859
That's how I see the world.

30:34.893 --> 30:39.028
- You got some news for me?
- <i>Yes sir.</i>

30:39.063 --> 30:42.164
I'm pushing my luck
according to the boss man.

30:42.199 --> 30:44.700
Open my flytrap
one more time,

30:44.803 --> 30:46.770
he fire me just like that.

30:48.404 --> 30:49.937
Did he now?

30:49.972 --> 30:53.039
How them other boys
feel about it?

30:53.074 --> 30:56.742
They be simmering,
Mr. White.

30:56.743 --> 30:59.744
Just waiting on me
to give 'em the word.

30:59.778 --> 31:02.681
Hm.

31:05.051 --> 31:08.120
So go on and give it to 'em.

31:16.963 --> 31:19.598
Arms for whiskey.

31:21.534 --> 31:24.768
I'd buy the liquor if I could.
I don't have the cash.

31:24.803 --> 31:26.736
Do you even have
the weapons?

31:26.770 --> 31:28.437
Why would you
think I didn't?

31:28.471 --> 31:32.039
I saw a dozen guns in a coin
and a stunt in a field.

31:32.073 --> 31:35.041
Can you really afford to
send me back empty-handed?

31:35.076 --> 31:44.483
My lot to live with if I do.

31:44.517 --> 31:47.552
Has Britain released any
of your imprisoned men?

31:47.553 --> 31:49.987
<i>Stopped seizing your guns</i>
<i>and ammunition?</i>

31:50.021 --> 31:53.190
Did they not just land other
15,000 troops on your soil?

31:53.258 --> 31:56.426
<i>And threaten</i>
<i>martial law?</i>

31:56.460 --> 31:59.462
Mr. McGarrigle, what have the British
offered you in the form of good faith?

31:59.496 --> 32:01.764
This is the pinch
of the game.

32:01.765 --> 32:05.033
<i>If the fighting's to stop,</i>
<i>one must take the lead.</i>

32:05.067 --> 32:07.368
That strategy might put
your people at risk.

32:07.403 --> 32:09.170
A risk I'm willing to take.

32:09.204 --> 32:13.206
You came to me in
your time of need.

32:13.241 --> 32:15.475
I helped you
without hesitation.

32:15.509 --> 32:18.311
<i>I'm asking you</i>
<i>to do the same.</i>

32:18.345 --> 32:20.579
And what's our cause
to you, sir?

32:20.614 --> 32:24.215
- I beg your pardon? - <i>Will you think</i>
<i>on the thousands that'll die,</i>

32:24.250 --> 32:27.084
<i>cut down by the Thompson</i>
<i>guns you'll put in our hands?</i>

32:27.119 --> 32:30.287
Or will you laze about your cabin
as you sail back across the sea,

32:30.322 --> 32:33.490
climb into your berth and
count yourself to sleep?

32:34.725 --> 32:36.893
Let's not lie to each other,
Mr. McGarrigle.

32:36.928 --> 32:40.729
Whenever men like you need to win,
you'll turn to men like me.

32:40.764 --> 32:42.264
Thank you for dinner.

32:42.298 --> 32:44.866
You can take me
back to the farm.

32:47.603 --> 32:49.637
A word with you.

32:56.544 --> 32:59.111
What's been your business with him?

32:59.146 --> 33:00.979
I've done as ordered

33:00.980 --> 33:04.649
and gone about <i>my</i> work.

33:04.684 --> 33:06.551
He's after nothing
I've done but himself.

33:06.552 --> 33:08.786
Fair to say he's in his own war.

33:08.821 --> 33:11.922
- For what?
- A great pile of dosh

33:11.956 --> 33:15.391
-- Is that all they fight for?

33:15.426 --> 33:17.560
It seems to keep them busy.

33:17.594 --> 33:20.963
You've changed.

33:20.997 --> 33:23.432
I've not.

33:23.466 --> 33:27.335
- You'll stay then, now you're back.
- No, I'm no peacemaker, sir.

33:27.369 --> 33:29.503
You've a head on your
shoulders. I've known it

33:29.538 --> 33:32.005
since the first day you come to me.
I want you close.

33:34.976 --> 33:37.877
Every battle ends, boy.

33:37.911 --> 33:39.845
You'll have to understand that.

33:41.880 --> 33:44.915
Will you help me?

33:44.949 --> 33:48.618
Well, I'll serve as needed.

34:02.163 --> 34:04.031
We're closed!

34:04.065 --> 34:07.267
Let me in!

34:20.580 --> 34:23.916
Eh, go to the polack.
He's open.

34:28.821 --> 34:30.722
All right already.

34:30.755 --> 34:33.157
The one day
I get to myself.

35:51.724 --> 35:54.692
Friend, tell me you happy

35:54.726 --> 35:57.127
puttin' that jackshit
in your mouth.

35:57.162 --> 36:01.765
Happy to get paid every
week, I know that.

36:01.799 --> 36:04.701
- Mm-hmm.
- $15 a week?

36:04.735 --> 36:07.203
The man upstairs bring
home 10 times that much.

36:07.237 --> 36:10.038
And for doing what?
He surely ain't washing no dishes.

36:10.073 --> 36:12.507
Ain't got his head
over a stove all day.

36:12.541 --> 36:14.175
Or guttin' fish
till his hand bleed.

36:14.209 --> 36:18.812
Don't kowtow to, "come here, boy.
Fetch me some water, boy.

36:18.847 --> 36:22.082
Send this steak back, boy."

36:22.116 --> 36:24.984
- Back to work, fellas.
- Say who?

36:25.019 --> 36:27.153
The manager be along
any minute now.

36:27.187 --> 36:28.921
Manager.

36:28.955 --> 36:32.491
Y'all been swallowin' shit one
way or another for how long now?

36:32.525 --> 36:35.660
- Working here goin' on four years.
- Five for me.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.161
- <i>Same here.</i>
- That's right.

36:37.196 --> 36:39.363
- Y'all ever get a raise?
- Not a one.

36:39.398 --> 36:43.667
- Nope. - Seems like this place
be takin' us all for granted.

36:43.701 --> 36:45.935
- They do.
- Yeah, you right. They do.

36:45.970 --> 36:49.038
Seems like they don't appreciate
the day in and day out.

36:49.073 --> 36:51.640
- They don't.
- Ain't nothing to be done about it.

36:51.675 --> 36:55.477
Cry and complains. All they gonna do is
just bring in another pair of hands.

36:55.511 --> 36:57.579
What if we all
cry and complain?

36:57.647 --> 36:59.681
They gonna
replace us all?

36:59.715 --> 37:01.382
- They might do.
- Really now?

37:01.582 --> 37:03.682
Every work a negro from the north side?

37:03.692 --> 37:06.727
What if we all say we ain't
gonna eat this slop?

37:06.821 --> 37:08.989
Ain't gonna work
for this wage?

37:09.023 --> 37:11.057
What they gonna do then?

37:13.026 --> 37:15.361
<i>Break's over!</i>

37:17.464 --> 37:19.531
Did you hear what I said?
Come on, back to work.

37:19.565 --> 37:22.233
- Ain't had lunch yet.
- Well, what's that your lap?

37:22.306 --> 37:25.074
Looks to me like it came out
the wrong end of a mule.

37:25.075 --> 37:27.107
Forget about the free
food, Mr President?

37:27.107 --> 37:31.507
- What food? - Tell you what, you can
cry all you want on your own time

37:31.508 --> 37:32.942
You're fired.

37:33.910 --> 37:36.010
<i>You hear me</i>
<i>you're thru.</i>

37:36.011 --> 37:37.879
<i>Now, get out!</i>

37:37.913 --> 37:39.980
<i>What do you got wax</i>
<i>in those ears?</i>

37:40.015 --> 37:43.050
I said you're fired, boy.

37:46.387 --> 37:48.688
Hey, you get out
before I call the police.

37:48.723 --> 37:52.458
We want a raise--
every single last one of us.

37:52.492 --> 37:54.860
And a lunch you'd eat yourself.

37:54.895 --> 37:56.595
You get back to work, Otis.

37:58.631 --> 38:01.466
You've got orders to prepare, don't you?
Well, then do it.

38:04.636 --> 38:08.138
Hey, Lewis, there's a dozen crates
of fish that need to be scal.

38:09.907 --> 38:12.475
- Franin, you wash those dishes.
- Yes sir.

38:19.175 --> 38:20.575
All right, don't be stupid, gentemen.

38:20.648 --> 38:22.415
You've all have exactly
five seconds...

38:29.121 --> 38:32.057
You wooly-head
ignorant coon.

38:32.091 --> 38:35.326
- We sick of this food!
- We want a raise!

38:35.360 --> 38:38.495
- Kiss our ass!
- Get out of here, man!

38:38.529 --> 38:39.762
Right now!

38:43.698 --> 38:45.498
Thank you for
your hospitality.

38:45.532 --> 38:47.767
My door is always open.

38:52.506 --> 38:54.974
So he's back to America.

38:55.008 --> 38:58.711
- Empty-handed. - You'll land
on your feet, I've no doubt.

38:58.778 --> 39:00.479
I'm not so sure.

39:00.513 --> 39:03.147
I was told you're all
optimists over there.

39:03.182 --> 39:04.982
Not the Irish ones.

39:11.055 --> 39:12.789
Please.

39:22.131 --> 39:24.832
Bill, see Mr. Thompson
gets safely to the port.

39:24.867 --> 39:26.367
I will, John.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.887
You'll deal with me now.

39:50.955 --> 39:55.424
1,000 machine guns for
10,000 cases of whiskey.

40:07.001 --> 40:08.401
<i>There's that big left!</i>

40:08.436 --> 40:10.303
<i>Dempsey catches</i>
<i>Carpentier on the nose!</i>

40:10.337 --> 40:12.371
<i>Carpentier reels backward,</i>
<i>his nose's bleeding now.</i>

40:12.406 --> 40:14.440
<i>Dempsey attacks.</i>
<i>Carpentier blocks a right.</i> - Yes!

40:14.474 --> 40:16.742
<i>Dempsey lands a left to the body.</i>

40:16.776 --> 40:19.411
<i>Dempsey unleashes</i>
<i>a flurry of raging fists.</i>

40:19.445 --> 40:22.346
<i>Carpentier launches a left,</i>
<i>a right and another right.</i>

40:22.381 --> 40:24.381
<i>A left from Dempsey</i>
<i>to the wrist.</i>

40:24.416 --> 40:26.950
<i>They're tied up now.</i>
<i>Free Dempsey leaks up the clinch.</i>

40:26.985 --> 40:29.353
<i>Dempsey uns a right.</i>
<i>Carpentier throws a left,</i>

40:29.387 --> 40:31.788
<i>then a big right to hit</i>
<i>Dempsey on the cheekbone.</i>

40:31.823 --> 40:34.090
<i>The champ-- the champ looks</i>
<i>stunned for a moment.</i>

40:34.125 --> 40:36.959
<i>Shaking it off now, a spray of</i>
<i>sweat spattering the canvas</i>

40:36.994 --> 40:39.528
<i>on this eltering day</i>
<i>of July the 2nd.</i>

40:39.563 --> 40:42.131
<i>Carpentier throws a left uppercut</i>
<i>that finds nothing but air.</i>

40:42.165 --> 40:44.332
<i>Dempsey responds with a right.</i>
<i>They clinch.</i>

40:44.367 --> 40:47.068
- <i>That's the end of round two.</i>

40:47.102 --> 40:50.471
<i>A veritable "who's who" of celebrities</i>
<i>and titans of industry--</i>

40:50.505 --> 40:53.372
<i>Tom Mix, Henry Ford,</i>
<i>George M. Cohan,</i>

40:53.407 --> 40:55.875
<i>Jolson, Rockefeller,</i>
<i>Astor, Gould and Vanderbilt</i>

40:55.909 --> 40:58.244
<i>all paying a pretty penny to see</i>
<i>the battle of the century.</i>

40:58.279 --> 41:00.847
<i>It's official now.</i>
<i>This is the first boxing match</i>

41:00.881 --> 41:02.549
<i>in history to top</i>
<i>$1 million at the gate.</i>

41:02.583 --> 41:04.651
<i>And these two goliaths</i>
<i>have not disappointed.</i>

41:04.685 --> 41:07.120
<i>By my estimation the first round</i>
<i>belonged to the champion.</i>

41:07.154 --> 41:08.888
<i>But in round two</i>
<i>Carpentier bounced back,</i>

41:08.922 --> 41:11.189
<i>landing a vicious right to the head</i>
<i>that sent Dempsey reeling.</i>

41:11.224 --> 41:14.659
- - <i>There's the bell for</i>
<i>the start of round three.</i>

41:14.693 --> 41:16.628
<i>Dempsey jabs.</i>

41:16.662 --> 41:19.830
<i>Carpentier responds with a left-right</i>
<i>combination and nothing lands.</i>

41:19.864 --> 41:22.730
<i>A right from Dempsey drives</i>
<i>Carpentier into a neutral corner.</i>

41:22.765 --> 41:25.231
<i>And a solid left. Carpentier</i>
<i>follows with aight.</i>

41:25.266 --> 41:27.499
<i>Now both fighters</i>
<i>dance around each other,</i>

41:27.533 --> 41:30.268
<i>looking for the opportunity</i>
<i>to deliver a knockout pow.</i>

41:30.302 --> 41:32.937
<i>Carpentier rushes Dempsey,</i>
<i>fires a shot to the head.</i>

41:32.972 --> 41:35.573
<i>Dempsey responds witha right,</i>
<i>then a flurry of jabs.</i>

41:35.608 --> 41:38.643
<i>Carpentier overing up. Having been</i>
<i>body at the start of this fight,</i>

41:38.677 --> 41:40.378
<i>the crowd is now</i>
<i>cheering for Dempsey.</i>

41:40.412 --> 41:42.780
<i>Carpentier backs away,</i>
<i>throws a rig that is short.</i>

41:42.814 --> 41:45.516
<i>Dempsey presses the challenger,</i>
<i>making him circle the ring.</i>

41:45.550 --> 41:47.317
<i>There's a left-right</i>
<i>for Dempsey.</i>

41:47.352 --> 41:49.286
<i>The frenchman follows with a</i>
<i>right to the body and another.</i>

41:49.320 --> 41:51.721
<i>Carpentier's punches</i>
<i>land but seem to have</i>

41:51.756 --> 41:53.590
<i>no effect on the champion.</i>
<i>Dempsey keep coming</i>

41:53.624 --> 41:56.126
<i>like a freight train in the dark of night.</i>
<i>dark of night.</i> - He's got him now

41:56.160 --> 41:58.661
<i>Another right, then a left.</i>
<i>Carpentier grabs Dempsey.</i> - Come on.

41:58.696 --> 42:00.497
<i>The champ takes the opportunity</i>
<i>to hurl a few short jabs--</i>

42:00.531 --> 42:01.731
-He's got him!
- <i>--To the midsection.</i>

42:01.766 --> 42:03.432
<i>The referee Harry Ertle</i>
<i>breaks them up.</i>

42:03.467 --> 42:06.034
<i>Carpentier comes</i> <i>back with a right.</i>
- Who's winning?

42:06.068 --> 42:08.302
- What round is it? - It's pretty even.
It's the third round.

42:08.336 --> 42:10.036
<i>Then again.</i>
<i>And another!</i>

42:10.037 --> 42:12.804
<i>Dempsey finishes off the barrage</i>
<i> with a left. Four straight shots!</i>

42:12.838 --> 42:15.437
<i>Carpentier backs away. Dempsey</i>
<i>follows, swings and lands a big left!</i>

42:15.472 --> 42:18.239
<i>Carpentier is against the ropes now.</i>

42:18.274 --> 42:20.308
<i>He throws a left hook.</i>
<i>And another.</i>

42:20.342 --> 42:22.777
<i>But Dempsey is not the world champion</i>
<i>for nothing, ladies and gtlemen.</i>

42:22.811 --> 42:24.478
<i>Here he comes right back.</i>

42:24.512 --> 42:26.680
<i>Three left uppercuts</i>
<i>to Carpentier's head.</i>

42:26.714 --> 42:28.548
<i>Then a left and a right.</i>

42:28.582 --> 42:31.016
<i>The frenchman seems dazzled by</i>
<i>Dempsey's superior speed and strength.</i>

42:31.050 --> 42:34.719
<i>Dempsey, the alleged draft dodger,</i>
<i>was booed early in the fight,</i>

42:34.754 --> 42:38.156
<i>but the last round was all his. Only the</i>
<i>bell stopped the punishing onslaught</i>

42:38.190 --> 42:41.492
<i>Dempsey was giving to the</i>
<i>presumedly-faster frenchmen...</i>

43:03.880 --> 43:06.782
<i>Cushla-macree.</i>

43:06.816 --> 43:10.084
<i>Mo mhuirnin.</i>

43:14.556 --> 43:18.658
Forgive me for what
I've brought upon you.

43:54.823 --> 43:57.391
<i>There's the bell.</i>
<i>Dempsey circles,</i>

43:57.425 --> 43:58.725
<i>stalking Carpentier.</i>

43:58.760 --> 44:01.962
Don't you girls want
to listen to the fight?

44:01.996 --> 44:04.464
We're more interested in the crowd.

44:07.401 --> 44:12.071
- Did you come alone?
- We got dressed all by ourselves too.

44:12.105 --> 44:14.640
You shouldn't pass notes
out to strangers.

44:14.674 --> 44:17.041
Oh, you're not a stranger.

44:17.647 --> 44:21.149
- I'm sorry, we've met?
- Not exactly but, uh,

44:22.049 --> 44:26.349
everyone knows
who the new king is.

44:26.817 --> 44:28.751
We saw you at Babette's.

44:28.785 --> 44:31.052
Oooh.

44:33.155 --> 44:35.022
I'm gonna be first.

44:35.057 --> 44:37.725
<i>Then another catches</i>
<i>Dempsey on the cheek.</i>

44:37.759 --> 44:40.894
<i>The champ is stung. His head collapses</i>
<i>on Carpentier's shoulder...</i>

44:40.928 --> 44:42.529
You're a little drunk.

44:42.563 --> 44:46.032
- Go star.
- All hail.

44:51.405 --> 44:53.506
What's the matter?

44:55.108 --> 44:57.075
Hey, he's with me.

44:57.110 --> 44:59.544
Aren't you?

45:02.046 --> 45:05.849
What the hell?
Something to talk about when we're old.

45:07.584 --> 45:10.686
<i>...And another and another.</i>
<i>The crowd's on its feet cheering.</i>

45:10.721 --> 45:13.122
<i>Dempsey stalks forward.</i>
<i>Carpentier retreats.</i>

45:13.157 --> 45:15.191
<i>Dempsey keeps coming.</i>
<i>The frenchman throws a left.</i>

45:15.225 --> 45:16.859
<i>That's not going</i>
<i>to stop the champ.</i>

45:16.893 --> 45:18.595
<i>He plows forward,</i>
<i>throwing punches at will.</i>

45:18.629 --> 45:21.432
<i>Carpentier puts his head down, tries</i>
<i>to fend off the storm of fists.</i>

45:21.467 --> 45:23.335
<i>Dempsey bores in,</i>
<i>pummels the frenchman,</i>

45:23.370 --> 45:26.206
<i>landing furious blow after blow</i>
<i>to Carpentier's head and body.</i>

45:26.241 --> 45:29.143
<i>Dempsey indisputably in charge now,
</i> running all four corners of this ring,</i>

45:29.177 --> 45:32.245
<i>a brutal lesson in American pugilism</i>
<i>for the conquered Gaul.</i>

45:53.787 --> 45:55.352
Two telegrams.

45:55.386 --> 45:57.120
Here we go.

45:57.154 --> 45:59.055
How long did you
know McGarrigle?

45:59.089 --> 46:02.725
Um, I was 17

46:02.760 --> 46:04.828
with an itch to fight.

46:04.863 --> 46:07.464
I tried to volunteer
and he turned me down.

46:07.498 --> 46:10.035
Twice.

46:10.069 --> 46:13.173
- Did they tell you?
- About the truce?

46:13.207 --> 46:15.309
About what was
going to happen.

46:19.546 --> 46:22.114
Nothing I could say
would stop it.

46:22.149 --> 46:25.217
And you made your deal.
That's what we came for.

46:25.252 --> 46:28.053
Besides...

46:28.088 --> 46:30.656
I don't live here anymore.

46:31.558 --> 46:33.459
Owen.

46:33.493 --> 46:36.628
I don't like secrets.

46:46.303 --> 46:49.972
"Forget Dempsey.
Judge set trial date,

46:50.006 --> 46:53.942
August 23rd.
Let the real battle begin."

46:55.611 --> 46:58.346
Who's the other from?

46:58.380 --> 47:00.348
Mrs. Schroeder.

47:00.382 --> 47:02.049
"Come home. Em--"

47:07.321 --> 47:09.088
uh,

47:09.122 --> 47:11.223
"Emily has polio."

47:13.960 --> 47:15.727
<i>All aboard!</i>

47:33.343 --> 47:35.410
<i>The champ throws a left that</i>
<i>hits Carpentier in the face.</i>

47:35.445 --> 47:37.345
<i>The frenchman responds</i>
<i>with a right that misses.</i>

47:37.379 --> 47:38.980
<i>Dempsey uncorks a right that lands.</i>
<i>Then another.</i>

47:39.014 --> 47:41.515
<i>And another! And another!</i>
<i>The crowd is on its feet cheering.</i>

47:41.550 --> 47:43.717
<i>Dempsey stalks forward.</i>
<i>Carpentier retreats.</i>

47:43.752 --> 47:45.886
<i>Dempsey keeps coming.</i>
<i>The frenchman throws a left.</i>

47:45.920 --> 47:47.387
<i>That's not going</i>
<i>to stop the champ.</i>

47:47.421 --> 47:49.155
<i>He plows forward,</i>
<i>throwing punches at will.</i>

47:49.190 --> 47:51.891
<i>Carpentier puts his head down, tries</i>
<i>to fend off the storm of fists.</i>

47:51.925 --> 47:54.893
<i>Dempsey bores in, pummels</i>
<i>the frenchman. Landing furious blow</i>

47:54.928 --> 47:56.862
<i>after blow to Carpentier's</i>
<i>head and body.</i>

47:56.896 --> 47:58.896
<i>The crowd is on its feet.</i>
<i>Carpentier is in trouble.</i>

47:58.931 --> 48:01.598
<i>He hangs on Dempsey's oulder.</i>
<i>Referee ertle separates them.</i>

48:01.632 --> 48:04.000
<i>My word! Now it's Carpentier</i>
<i>throwing a stiff left.</i>

48:04.034 --> 48:05.768
<i>Then another one!</i>
<i>Followed by a right.</i>

48:05.802 --> 48:07.469
<i>But the champ--</i>
<i>the champ is not fazed.</i>

48:07.504 --> 48:10.271
<i>He comes back with a left hook then</i>
<i>a thundering right to the face.</i>

48:10.306 --> 48:12.173
<i>And Carpentier is down!</i>
<i>The frenchman is down!</i>

48:12.207 --> 48:15.543
<i>The count starts--</i>
<i>two, three, four,</i>

48:15.577 --> 48:18.579
<i>five, six, seven, eight--</i>

48:18.613 --> 48:20.680
<i>and Carpentier is up.</i>
<i>He's up!</i>

48:20.715 --> 48:22.582
<i>Carpentier starts</i>
<i>toward dempsey.</i>

48:22.616 --> 48:25.451
<i>The champ rushes him. Carpentier</i>
<i>throws a right that Dempsey deflects.</i>

48:25.486 --> 48:27.787
<i>Then the champ unleashes</i>
<i>a punishing right to</i>

48:27.788 --> 48:29.221
<i>the chestand a left</i>
<i>uppercut to the jaw.</i>

48:29.222 --> 48:32.356
<i>And Carpentier is down again!</i>
<i>He's down again on the canvas!</i>

48:32.391 --> 48:36.359
<i>Three, four, five.</i>
<i>Carpentier is on his back</i>

48:36.393 --> 48:38.193
<i>trying to get up.</i>
<i>The count continues.</i>

48:38.227 --> 48:41.162
<i>Seven, eight, nine, 10.</i>
<i> That's it!</i>

48:41.196 --> 48:44.664
