00:01.960 --> 00:04.236
MENELAUS:
Your story is a strange one.

00:04.280 --> 00:06.317
<i>I should like to hear it
from your mouth.</i>

00:06.360 --> 00:08.397
PRIAM:
<i>You're not a shepherd any more.</i>

00:08.440 --> 00:11.876
Your name is Alexander, Prince of Troy.

00:13.080 --> 00:14.514
LITOS:
You're making a great mistake.

00:14.560 --> 00:15.834
I see it in his eyes!

00:15.880 --> 00:20.158
HELEN: <i>Troy controls the straits
from Asia, so everyone Wants a piece.</i>

00:20.200 --> 00:22.589
Welcome to the world, Prince.

00:22.640 --> 00:26.235
HERMIONE: <i>The queen sends her apologies.
She won't be down to say goodbye.</i>

00:26.280 --> 00:28.237
<i>See that it's carefully
loaded onto the ship.</i>

00:28.280 --> 00:29.759
<i>UTOS".
The gods do not forget.</i>

00:45.840 --> 00:49.151
Where is she?
<i>—</i> I told you, he's taken her.

00:54.280 --> 00:56.032
That's not possible!

00:57.560 --> 00:58.994
I will not be humiliated.

00:59.040 --> 01:01.031
Get a message to my brother.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.918
INDISTINCT YELLING

01:42.040 --> 01:44.554
INDISTINCT CHATTER

02:28.480 --> 02:32.075
Is it true? He brought her right up
the street like his bloody bride.

02:35.880 --> 02:37.109
Where are they?

02:37.640 --> 02:40.837
They're resting from the journey.
They're coming to see me later.

02:45.840 --> 02:46.830
Is it what I think?

02:49.320 --> 02:50.310
Tell them.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.038
He stole her away in a chest.

02:54.680 --> 02:57.513
We had no idea she was inside
until we set sail.

02:57.560 --> 02:59.870
I tried to persuade him to return her.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.638
He threatened to throw me in the sea.

03:01.680 --> 03:02.829
He claims to love her.

03:02.880 --> 03:04.917
How could you not notice
what was going on?

03:04.960 --> 03:06.519
I apologise, my lady.

03:06.560 --> 03:08.073
I should have foreseen that

03:08.120 --> 03:10.839
while the King of Sparta
was burying his dead father

03:10.880 --> 03:13.349
your new son would try
to sleep with his wife.

03:13.400 --> 03:18.429
Don't you use that tone with us!
We put him in your charge!

03:19.840 --> 03:23.037
By now, Menelaus will know
they've eloped.

03:23.080 --> 03:24.400
He'll have told his brother.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.874
Agamemnon needs no excuse
for a fight.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.395
She must be sent back,
before they do something foolish.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.396
Andromache's right.

03:33.160 --> 03:35.390
Agamemnon will have rallied
all the kings of Greece.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.839
We can't waste any time.

03:36.880 --> 03:39.918
We'll send a message that
we regret the discourtesy

03:39.960 --> 03:42.349
return Helen
and send gifts of our own.

03:42.400 --> 03:43.799
Why should I bow to him?

03:43.840 --> 03:47.720
We made this city prosperous
through sweat and blood.

03:47.760 --> 03:51.071
This city bows to no one.
<i>—</i> And will continue to do so.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.671
Your pride can afford to take one hit

03:53.720 --> 03:56.109
if it's to save the city
from any future harm.

03:59.320 --> 04:00.913
She must go back, Priam.

04:05.920 --> 04:07.115
Leave us.

04:19.399 --> 04:21.437
Forgive me, your majesty.

04:21.480 --> 04:23.710
The Spartan Queen requests an audience.

04:23.760 --> 04:25.797
No, I said later.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.835
My lord. My lady.

04:39.240 --> 04:42.437
If my fate is to be decided,
I would like you to hear me first.

04:43.480 --> 04:46.074
You have a nerve, my lady.

04:46.840 --> 04:47.796
Iheanu

04:48.880 --> 04:50.598
m)' queen

04:50.640 --> 04:52.836
that you rule Troy alongside
your husband.

04:53.840 --> 04:57.276
That in this city, man and woman
are equal in respect and power.

04:58.240 --> 05:00.800
I humbly claim that respect now.

05:02.880 --> 05:05.269
I was married at 14 against my will

05:05.320 --> 05:08.790
to a man I had not met
and would never love.

05:09.880 --> 05:14.397
Not for one moment
have I been happy with Menelaus.

05:15.560 --> 05:18.916
I didn't choose him. I never would have.

05:20.560 --> 05:21.470
I do choose...

05:23.520 --> 05:24.954
to be with your son.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.554
I'm not a possession.

05:32.480 --> 05:33.595
I'm a woman.

05:34.880 --> 05:36.029
I think.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.075
I feel.

05:39.120 --> 05:41.839
And I'm here because I want to be.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.270
SHE SIGHS

06:03.080 --> 06:07.392
DIOMEDES: Agamemnon demands that
Odysseus join him in support of his brother.

06:07.440 --> 06:11.070
I've told you, our king is distracted.
<i>—</i> Mm.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.310
Let me see him.

06:17.320 --> 06:18.913
He's not fit to see anyone.

06:19.400 --> 06:22.153
BABY CRIES

06:22.200 --> 06:26.797
Shh, shh, shh. Baby, shh, shh, shh.

06:34.840 --> 06:37.195
My lady. Good to see you again.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.398
You're looking for my husband?
<i>—</i> Yes.

06:41.440 --> 06:44.512
He and his army are required
to join the war effort against Troy.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.710
I read your letters.

06:46.760 --> 06:49.070
The Trojan Prince
has offended the whole of Greece.

06:49.120 --> 06:51.509
Which is why the whole of Greece
must rebuff him.

06:53.760 --> 06:58.914
A week ago, Odysseus was taken
with a fever which went to his brain.

07:00.080 --> 07:03.277
I'm sorry to hear that.
<i>—</i> He won't talk to me.

07:03.960 --> 07:06.156
To any of us.
<i>—</i> Take me to him.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.832
He ploughs it day and night.

07:20.800 --> 07:24.111
Odysseus!
It's Diomedes, your old friend.

07:26.640 --> 07:29.758
There's no point taking him to war.
What use would he be?

07:30.080 --> 07:31.070
Maybe.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.235
Maybe he's as cunning as he ever was.

07:38.440 --> 07:40.078
Maybe you both are.

07:42.600 --> 07:45.399
BABY CRIES

07:45.440 --> 07:48.159
PENELOPE:
Odysseus! No!

07:48.200 --> 07:50.077
BULLS LOW

07:55.800 --> 07:58.872
Odysseus! Stop!

08:03.160 --> 08:04.992
You're not so mad after all.

08:17.600 --> 08:18.829
Telemachus...

08:27.920 --> 08:29.558
You're the man of the house now.

08:31.560 --> 08:34.200
Look after your mother
and sister for me. You must.

08:35.520 --> 08:36.554
Come here.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.389
Let's go!
<i>—</i> MAN: Move on!

09:06.680 --> 09:07.556
Walk on!

09:14.560 --> 09:17.439
INDISTINCT WHISPERS

09:43.400 --> 09:45.232
PRIAM:
First, welcome home, my son.

09:46.520 --> 09:47.919
Thank you, Father.

09:47.960 --> 09:50.918
You understand, of course

09:50.960 --> 09:54.590
what has happened between you
is not just a matter of the personal.

09:54.640 --> 09:57.280
Your actions are political
because of who you are.

09:57.320 --> 10:00.153
Father, listen to me...
<i>—</i> We sent you, Alexander

10:00.200 --> 10:02.032
on a mission of diplomacy.

10:03.040 --> 10:06.158
There are voices in favour
of sending the queen back.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.476
CROWD WHISPERS

10:08.520 --> 10:11.751
You dare... I'll go with her.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.711
Sit down.
<i>—</i> You'll never see me again.

10:13.760 --> 10:15.478
Sit down!

10:15.520 --> 10:18.399
Alexander, my love...

10:20.440 --> 10:21.714
Sit down.

10:29.040 --> 10:30.792
You are our son

10:30.840 --> 10:33.719
and whatever we may feel on the matter

10:33.760 --> 10:35.717
we love and defend you.

10:36.680 --> 10:40.674
We will therefore seek an agreement
with our Greek friends.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.920
We will keep the queen

10:44.960 --> 10:47.634
but send ambassadors
with gifts of Troy

10:47.680 --> 10:51.639
that will more than match
those you have brought from Sparta.

10:51.680 --> 10:53.751
Hopefully, our embassy will arrive

10:53.800 --> 10:57.350
before the Greeks' anger
turns into action.

10:58.240 --> 11:02.154
Who knows? This may even
strengthen bonds, not break them.

11:02.200 --> 11:05.795
This won't work.
You must know that the Greeks...

11:05.840 --> 11:08.309
they won't accept gold
as a substitute for a queen.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.999
She is flesh and a symbol.

11:12.040 --> 11:13.997
They'll just throw it back in your face.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.919
This is the decision of myself
and the queen.

11:17.720 --> 11:21.236
In the meantime,
Helen is to be treated as our guest

11:21.280 --> 11:22.793
and closest friend.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.630
Agamemnon, he's arrived.

12:15.080 --> 12:16.434
You're late.

12:16.480 --> 12:18.790
Your letters failed to reach me.

12:22.760 --> 12:24.433
Tricks of Hermes.

12:43.920 --> 12:47.800
Now we are complete! No more delay!

12:53.280 --> 12:55.874
Tricks of Hermes?
Tricks of Penelope, more like.

12:56.760 --> 12:59.434
Ajax, what do you know about women?

13:00.520 --> 13:02.477
Stick to fighting and spitting.

13:05.440 --> 13:08.478
Who else is here?
<i>—</i> We all are.

13:08.520 --> 13:12.070
Lovers and defenders of Greece,
as I know you are.

13:13.280 --> 13:14.679
And the best strategist we have.

13:15.480 --> 13:18.120
You don't need me to return a whore
to her marriage bed.

13:18.160 --> 13:20.993
You admire Helen
as much as the rest of us.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.517
I seem to remember
you fought for her hand.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.354
We all did.

13:28.440 --> 13:29.794
And look who won her.

13:30.920 --> 13:33.150
No war should be fought
for such a man.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.874
In stealing Helen,
the Trojan Prince insulted all of us.

13:35.920 --> 13:39.038
Not just about the girl, though,
is it, Nestor?

13:46.400 --> 13:48.038
Is that Achilles?

13:49.360 --> 13:52.273
Oh, yes. He's here, too.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.719
Odysseus, let's walk together.

14:08.960 --> 14:10.917
I know we've shared
harsh words in the past.

14:11.760 --> 14:13.831
I'd just like to say...
<i>—</i> All forgotten, my lord.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.118
We have one enemy now.

14:25.880 --> 14:27.518
This war won't take long.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.438
We get the queen back...

14:31.920 --> 14:33.319
and we teach them a lesson.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.359
The gods will see to it.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.316
They must.

14:39.800 --> 14:40.870
ODYSSEUS:
Cruel wind.

14:42.960 --> 14:44.792
How long has it been blowing like this?

14:44.840 --> 14:47.070
It's been gusting onshore since we came.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.155
It'll change.

14:48.200 --> 14:49.156
If it doesn't?

14:50.440 --> 14:51.874
We can't sail in this.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.277
Did you make offerings to the goddess?

15:00.320 --> 15:03.551
In the haste of anger,
rituals may have been neglected.

15:03.600 --> 15:06.672
She's offended.
<i>—</i> The offence is against us.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.398
The winds will change.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.511
Get the priest and the seers.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.357
Make offerings of birds to the goddess.

15:17.640 --> 15:18.630
Now.

15:23.480 --> 15:25.517
Surely Artemis will understand.

15:41.280 --> 15:46.116
Artemis, accept these pledges of regret
for our forgetfulness.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.591
Huntress, abate your anger.

15:51.920 --> 15:55.117
Please, show mercy.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.633
Tell us your will.

15:58.680 --> 16:01.354
Whatever you desire, we will perform.

16:22.280 --> 16:23.270
What happened?

16:27.960 --> 16:28.870
She demands...

16:30.680 --> 16:32.796
Speak, man. What is it?

16:34.280 --> 16:35.600
She demands...

16:36.720 --> 16:40.395
a sacrifice of a clove, purer than pure.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.791
I tried. I took a white dove in my hand

16:44.840 --> 16:47.400
cut its throat, but she just laughed.

16:49.280 --> 16:51.078
She said, 'That is not the dove I mean.'

16:54.160 --> 16:55.992
The dove she wants is human.

16:57.880 --> 16:58.870
Human?

17:00.520 --> 17:01.430
Your daughter.

17:15.960 --> 17:18.031
This will be prevented.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.036
Try again.

17:28.920 --> 17:30.991
Brother...
<i>—</i> Don't say anything.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.200
There must be a way.

17:35.080 --> 17:36.957
The goddess was clear.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.115
Why?

17:38.160 --> 17:40.390
Why demand that?
To kill my own blood, why?

17:40.440 --> 17:42.636
So you can look a Trojan in the eye
as you break their city

17:42.680 --> 17:44.671
and know that nothing they suffer

17:44.720 --> 17:46.472
can compare to what you suffered here.

17:47.760 --> 17:52.675
What kind of justice is that?
<i>—</i> The justice of war, my lord.

17:54.200 --> 17:57.192
Then we won't travel to Troy.
<i>—</i> You will have us look like cowards.

17:57.240 --> 18:00.870
Then you give up your child!
<i>—</i> Hermione wasn't asked for.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.071
What if I offer myself?
I'll slit my own throat.

18:05.120 --> 18:07.714
Then we lose a leader, gain nothing.

18:10.400 --> 18:14.439
There is no negotiation, sir.
You know that.

18:16.720 --> 18:17.994
Brother...

18:20.200 --> 18:22.111
We are running out of time.

18:24.680 --> 18:26.512
We must find the best way...

18:28.640 --> 18:30.472
to expedite...

18:30.520 --> 18:33.638
Expedite? Expedite?
Do you have a heart?

18:33.680 --> 18:37.833
Yes, my lord, but we are here now.

18:39.120 --> 18:41.031
The winds will not change unless you do.

18:42.360 --> 18:47.514
Your men will not follow a king
the gods have abandoned.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.350
We have tried all other forms
of sacrifice.

19:04.920 --> 19:06.752
Artemis is unmoveable.

19:17.160 --> 19:18.833
Alexander's our son.

19:18.880 --> 19:21.440
My instinct is to defend him
even though he's wrong.

19:22.720 --> 19:23.915
Mine, too.

19:28.840 --> 19:30.751
You remember the first time I saw you?

19:32.120 --> 19:33.952
The spring games at Hattusa.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.754
I was spellbound by you in seconds.

19:39.800 --> 19:42.189
Wouldn't you like to be young again?

19:43.160 --> 19:45.879
To have what Alexander's
got in his eyes?

19:45.920 --> 19:47.115
That self-belief?

19:50.720 --> 19:52.199
Age mellows us.

19:56.840 --> 19:59.070
But it's supposed to make us wise.

20:03.320 --> 20:04.310
Ah.

20:17.160 --> 20:19.276
Your daughter will be here soon.

20:23.120 --> 20:24.599
What have they been told?

20:33.000 --> 20:34.070
Help me.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.759
Get me out of this.

20:41.920 --> 20:43.399
I'm sorry.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.549
I don't know how.

21:01.920 --> 21:05.834
Xanthius, make sure
Achilles stays in his tent.

21:05.880 --> 21:08.269
He knows nothing about this.

21:08.320 --> 21:11.199
Going behind
the great fighter's back, sir?

21:11.240 --> 21:12.310
He'll love that.

21:12.360 --> 21:15.671
Thersites, if I want your opinion,
I will ask for it.

21:18.480 --> 21:20.596
HE WHISTLES

21:25.240 --> 21:28.517
Why am I marrying now?
Just when they're going to war?

21:28.560 --> 21:31.393
Your wedding will bless
the voyage to Troy.

21:32.520 --> 21:35.160
Anyway, I don't know why you're moaning.

21:35.760 --> 21:38.718
It's Achilles. Not exactly a monster.

21:40.480 --> 21:42.312
Will I live with him? After?

21:42.360 --> 21:43.680
Yes, of course.

21:46.360 --> 21:47.953
What is it?

21:48.960 --> 21:50.314
I don't want to leave you.

21:50.360 --> 21:52.078
You're not leaving us.

21:52.120 --> 21:56.034
You're joining Achilles.
It's a very different thing.

21:58.920 --> 22:00.240
And he is handsome.

22:08.640 --> 22:09.516
Try these.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.239
What are they?

22:14.280 --> 22:16.715
Mulberries. They give the cheek life.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.596
Not like that. You'll look drunk.

22:27.520 --> 22:28.749
Here, let me.

22:32.640 --> 22:34.790
It should look like it
comes out of the face.

23:03.720 --> 23:07.190
This is wonderful news,
if unexpected.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.752
The gods wish it as a blessing.

23:10.640 --> 23:12.916
And the warrior is willing?
<i>—</i> He is.

ODYSSEUS:
The king will take Iphigenia to the altar.

23:46.640 --> 23:48.039
I will escort you to him.

My husband is not himself.

24:20.520 --> 24:22.113
What's going on, Odysseus?

24:23.120 --> 24:25.509
Has Achilles changed his mind?
<i>—</i> No, my lady.

24:25.560 --> 24:29.394
He's preparing himself,
apart from the rest, up on the brow.

24:29.440 --> 24:31.238
Then why is everything so rushed?

24:31.280 --> 24:33.317
You know Menelaus has been humiliated.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.758
There's no time for pause.

24:37.240 --> 24:38.469
This way.

24:43.920 --> 24:45.069
What is this?

25:12.680 --> 25:14.478
This doesn't look like a marriage altar.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.474
Where are the flowers?

25:20.840 --> 25:23.116
What is it, Father? You look afraid.

25:28.760 --> 25:29.909
The gods...

25:31.000 --> 25:33.435
they didn't demand |phigenia's marriage.

25:34.040 --> 25:35.155

25:39.160 --> 25:41.515
NO. No! No!

26:08.640 --> 26:10.313
But I'm your daughter.

She's playing with us all.

She left her own daughter, Hector.
What kind of a woman does that?

I don't know.

29:54.280 --> 29:55.998
What if they come for her?

What will we do?

Tell me.

30:36.720 --> 30:38.757
We were restocking at Thrace.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.996
We saw a fleet of Greek ships.

30:41.040 --> 30:44.078
Thousands of men, weapons,
chariots, horses.

30:44.120 --> 30:45.872
Who leads them?
<i>—</i> All the Greek kings.

30:46.800 --> 30:51.749
Agamemnon. Odysseus.
Diomedes. Nestor of Pylos.

30:53.480 --> 30:56.279
Achilles was there
and all his Myrmidon warriors.

30:57.040 --> 30:59.554
When I asked a soldier
why they were at sea

30:59.600 --> 31:01.671
he said they were after stolen treasure.

31:03.360 --> 31:04.873
I asked where they were going.

31:06.080 --> 31:07.070
They said here.

31:12.160 --> 31:13.195
Thank you.

31:18.600 --> 31:22.036
Set out beacons on the cliffs
and on the outlying islands.

I'll send word to Andromache's father

I'll raise the army,
put the city on war footing.

You were right.

Come on. Armies need bread.

That's all.
<i>—</i> No.

33:17.440 --> 33:18.760
They don't trust me.

33:20.400 --> 33:21.834
And they won't trust you, either.

33:24.400 --> 33:25.310

We're ready for you, Menelaus!

We should talk,

I am honoured to have you

I hope the welcome on the beach
showed you

desire the shedding of blood.

HORSE WHINNIES

43:38.240 --> 43:41.835
AGAMEMNON:
Tomorrow at dawn, outright assault.

43:41.880 --> 43:45.589
We start at the ridge, charge the plain,
meet them face-to—face.

43:45.640 --> 43:48.280
Infantry and horsemen.

43:48.320 --> 43:50.834
We force them back to their own walls.

43:51.760 --> 43:54.673
We climb the citadel,
we take the city, we get her back.

43:55.560 --> 43:58.996
We take their gold,
we destroy the city, we go home.

43:59.800 --> 44:01.393
We should build ditches.

44:02.080 --> 44:04.515
Dig ourselves in between
the plain and the ships

44:04.560 --> 44:06.597
in case of counter-attack.

44:06.640 --> 44:07.835
No need.

44:08.600 --> 44:10.637
The assault will take one day,
and no more.

44:11.280 --> 44:12.679
How can you be sure?

44:13.120 --> 44:15.111
The gods have guaranteed it.

44:16.600 --> 44:18.398
With my daughter's blood.

44:35.560 --> 44:36.755
Remember.

44:37.280 --> 44:40.477
Remember. Remember.

44:47.720 --> 44:49.472
You come back to me.

45:10.240 --> 45:11.116
Go on.

45:16.040 --> 45:18.919
He's friendly. You can stroke him.

45:25.360 --> 45:26.919
Doesn't your dad help you with that?

45:26.960 --> 45:28.394
Haven't got a clad.

45:32.480 --> 45:33.629
I'll help you home.

45:37.880 --> 45:41.157
My name's Telamon.
I'm a trader from Thrace.

45:41.200 --> 45:43.157
I got here three weeks ago
and now look what's happened.

45:43.200 --> 45:44.315
HE WHISTLES

45:44.360 --> 45:45.589
What's your dog called?

45:46.200 --> 45:47.315
His name's Keno.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.195
PARIS:
But why not?

45:49.240 --> 45:53.074
Because every Greek, every damn one,
will seek you out.

45:53.120 --> 45:56.238
Menelaus knows what you look like.
We can't disguise you.

45:56.280 --> 45:58.237
We need to keep you safe,
away from the field.

45:58.280 --> 46:01.159
I'll look like a coward.
<i>—</i> Rather that than a corpse.

46:02.120 --> 46:04.350
Go back to Helen. Stay safe.
<i>—</i> My lord.

46:04.400 --> 46:07.358
Aeneas and the Dardanian forces
have arrived from the south.

46:07.400 --> 46:08.470
Ah.

46:08.520 --> 46:11.558
Aeneas, your speed is welcome.

46:11.600 --> 46:14.956
We heard of the Spartan Queen's arrival,
so we were already standing by.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.115
Come.

46:20.720 --> 46:23.394
HORSE WHINNIES

46:38.960 --> 46:40.758
Let's go get them, my lord.

47:32.400 --> 47:34.630
AGAMEMNON: Are you with me?
<i>—</i> CROWD: Yes!

47:34.680 --> 47:36.591
Are you with me?
<i>—</i> Yes!

47:36.640 --> 47:38.551
Are you with me?
<i>—</i> Yes!

47:38.600 --> 47:41.160
Are you with me?
<i>—</i> Yes!

47:41.200 --> 47:43.760
Are you with me?
<i>—</i> Yes!

47:43.800 --> 47:46.599
Are you with me?

47:46.640 --> 47:51.157
Are you with me? Are you with me?

47:55.320 --> 47:59.439
I want your loyalty, Zeus,
to Greece and to me.

47:59.480 --> 48:01.312
Athena has already demanded it.

48:02.240 --> 48:04.072
And what I said to her, I say to you.

48:04.880 --> 48:06.598
I will not take sides.

48:18.600 --> 48:21.911
Aphrodite must be punished.
She bribed him with flesh.

48:22.600 --> 48:26.833
And such underhand methods,
you'd never contemplate.

48:32.800 --> 48:35.838
Be a coward, then. We won't need you.

48:37.680 --> 48:38.511
Good.

48:57.480 --> 48:59.551
Victory will be fast.

49:01.080 --> 49:02.150
That, I doubt.

49:23.240 --> 49:28.314
Ajax of Telamon,
unbeatable in brawl, I bless you.

49:29.680 --> 49:34.197
Deiphobus and Troilus,
sons of Priam, I bless you.

49:34.240 --> 49:37.596
Odysseus,
leader of the high—hearted men

49:37.640 --> 49:41.031
of Cephalonia and Ithaca, I bless you.

49:41.080 --> 49:42.832
Sarpedon and Glaucus

49:42.880 --> 49:45.838
of the swirling waters of Xanthos,
I bless you.

49:45.880 --> 49:48.190
Nestor and his son Antilochus

49:48.240 --> 49:51.949
Agapenor of Arcadia, I bless you.

49:55.960 --> 49:59.476
ATHENA:
Aeneas, leader of the Dardanians of the south

49:59.520 --> 50:00.635
I bless you.

50:01.200 --> 50:05.797
Diomedes, the spear,
son of Tydeus, I bless you.

50:19.480 --> 50:21.232
Hector.

50:23.280 --> 50:25.351
HORSE WHINNIES

50:25.400 --> 50:26.470
MAN YELLS

50:26.520 --> 50:27.999
Achilles!

50:30.200 --> 50:32.510
SOLDIERS YELL

51:25.520 --> 51:29.559
SOLDIER 1:
Retreat! Retreat! Fall back!

51:29.800 --> 51:31.632
SOLDIER 2:
Behind the line!

52:13.840 --> 52:15.717
We didn't make one inch of ground.

52:17.880 --> 52:19.791
We should be surrounding the city.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.560
Dig ourselves in,
cutting their supplies.

52:24.760 --> 52:27.274
This isn't warfare. This is a madness.

52:29.680 --> 52:31.876
Maybe tomorrow will be different.

52:33.600 --> 52:34.749
Nestor...

52:36.160 --> 52:41.109
When Hector refused our demands,
I saw the years open up before me.

52:46.120 --> 52:48.680
I'll be an old man
before I see home again.

52:48.720 --> 52:50.552
What will I be?

52:55.720 --> 53:00.635
Can I help? Can I help?
I can help! I can help.

53:13.360 --> 53:16.716
SOLDIERS GROAN IN PAIN

53:43.600 --> 53:44.829
KNOCK AT DOOR

53:51.760 --> 53:52.955
I want to see her.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.071
What are you doing in here?

53:59.120 --> 54:00.872
You need to leave now.

54:06.200 --> 54:07.998
You should never have come.

54:09.240 --> 54:10.594
You should never have come!

54:12.240 --> 54:14.072
You should never have come!

54:19.600 --> 54:22.479
INDISTINCT CHATTER

54:42.840 --> 54:45.719
AGAMEMNON: I know she's dead,
so why do I keep seeing her?

54:48.440 --> 54:50.351
Why did I do it? What was the point?

54:52.480 --> 54:53.629
It was demanded.

54:56.600 --> 54:57.999
And what's my reward?

55:00.320 --> 55:01.799
More death. More blood.

55:02.480 --> 55:03.800
Is that justice?

55:04.640 --> 55:07.996
War is like a grief, sir.

55:10.360 --> 55:12.556
You can't force it to be over in one day.

55:15.520 --> 55:16.715
We will prevail.

55:18.600 --> 55:20.113
But not like this.

55:23.520 --> 55:24.840
Tell me what to do.

55:36.120 --> 55:37.235
He's agreed.

55:38.640 --> 55:39.789
Surround the city.

55:40.720 --> 55:42.870
One sentry post every half-mile.

55:42.920 --> 55:44.911
Let no one in, no one out.

55:48.280 --> 55:49.839
Tell the men to dig deep.

55:50.880 --> 55:52.109
It needs to last.

55:57.320 --> 55:58.958
Wait! Wait!

56:00.600 --> 56:03.513
Have you seen Queen Helen?
I can't find her.

56:08.240 --> 56:09.469
What?

56:13.680 --> 56:15.159
Tell me, where has she gone?

56:24.760 --> 56:27.115
<i>VULTURE SQUAWKS</i>

56:34.840 --> 56:36.717
Go back.
<i>—</i> Wait.

56:39.280 --> 56:40.111
Wait!

56:49.440 --> 56:52.637
All this, because of what?

56:54.960 --> 56:56.712
The goddess wanted to win
a competition?

56:58.520 --> 57:01.797
This isn't going to be over in a week,
or a month.

57:01.840 --> 57:04.912
There'|| be more battles, more deaths.

57:06.120 --> 57:08.760
I can't be the one responsible for that.

57:10.960 --> 57:12.553
Don't say it.

57:13.440 --> 57:14.396
I'm going home.

57:15.960 --> 57:17.109
That's not your home.

57:21.800 --> 57:23.711
Then where is?
<i>—</i> With me.

57:32.200 --> 57:35.158
Love isn't always enough.
<i>—</i> Then what is?

57:39.280 --> 57:41.396
What is worth fighting for?
