WEBVTT

00:08.000 --> 00:09.411
<i>I'm Peggy Carter.</i>

00:09.480 --> 00:10.925
<i>- I work for the SSR,</i>

00:11.000 --> 00:13.685
<i>America's premier
covert intelligence agency.</i>

00:13.760 --> 00:14.886
<i>But now that the war is over,</i>

00:14.960 --> 00:16.530
<i>my mission parameters
these days are...</i>

00:16.600 --> 00:18.011
Agent Carter, cover the phones.

00:18.120 --> 00:19.121
<i>...different.</i>

00:19.200 --> 00:20.611
<i>That all changed when an old friend</i>

00:20.680 --> 00:22.489
<i>asked me to become a double agent.</i>

00:22.560 --> 00:24.688
I have a vault.
Somebody cleaned me out.

00:24.760 --> 00:26.125
A couple of weeks later,
my inventions...

00:26.200 --> 00:27.884
They start turning up
on the black market.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.325
<i>He left me with an ally.</i>

00:29.400 --> 00:31.402
- Edwin Jarvis.
- He'll help you in any way he can.

00:31.480 --> 00:34.165
As of this moment, Howard Stark
is a fugitive from justice.

00:34.240 --> 00:35.810
You're the only one
that can clear my name.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.769
You're telling me one woman
took out an entire team

00:38.840 --> 00:39.921
of highly trained government agents?

00:40.440 --> 00:42.329
- Stop.
- You know I can't do that.

00:42.400 --> 00:43.526
You don't have a choice.

00:47.160 --> 00:48.161
Where are you going?

00:48.240 --> 00:49.446
There's something I need to get
from The Griffith.

00:49.520 --> 00:51.568
<i>What could you possibly need?
Steve's blood.</i>

00:51.640 --> 00:53.085
<i>Monsters are real,</i>

00:53.160 --> 00:56.323
<i>and there is none
more terrifying than Leviathan.</i>

00:56.600 --> 00:57.965
You're wearing my brand.

00:58.960 --> 01:00.405
Is that Peggy Carter?

01:00.480 --> 01:01.606
Oh, gosh, Mister, can you help?

01:04.599 --> 01:05.806
Let's get started.

01:19.680 --> 01:20.761
Dr. Fennhoff.

01:21.560 --> 01:23.847
Dr. Fennhoff, I need you in surgery.

01:26.040 --> 01:27.485
I don't understand.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.127
The nurses, they tell me of your talent.

01:30.760 --> 01:33.889
They say you can numb a man's mind,
make him feel no pain.

01:35.800 --> 01:39.600
I have never attempted my
technique during an operation.

01:39.880 --> 01:41.609
Believe me, I would not come to you

01:41.680 --> 01:43.444
if I had any other option.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.682
We have more wounded than supplies.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.809
We have used all of our anesthetic.

01:51.240 --> 01:52.571
Devil take me.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.806
Infection has taken hold
of Private Ovechkin's leg.

02:03.080 --> 02:05.765
He will die unless we amputate.

02:07.040 --> 02:08.804
Tell me now, Doctor.

02:09.039 --> 02:11.646
Can you help me save this boy's life?

02:16.240 --> 02:19.449
Take me to your life
before the war.

02:21.400 --> 02:24.882
On the day before I left,
we had a picnic.

02:26.040 --> 02:28.202
I played chess with my mother.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.247
It is better to play outside, I think.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.485
I drew the game out.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.802
I tried to make it last forever.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.923
<i>Nurse, hold the skin back.</i>

02:41.400 --> 02:42.890
<i>Clean this area.</i>

02:45.840 --> 02:48.525
Pay no attention to them,
Private Ovechkin.

02:49.360 --> 02:50.930
Focus on the game.

02:51.160 --> 02:53.128
Focus on your mother.

02:55.880 --> 02:59.930
You may stay in this day
for as long as you want.

03:00.840 --> 03:02.251
But you must focus.

03:04.280 --> 03:05.805
She surrendered the game.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.327
She said I could not stop time.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.290
We walked.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.604
I tried to make her laugh.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.207
I spoke of the future,

03:23.280 --> 03:25.408
what we would do when I came home.

03:26.800 --> 03:29.565
That is good, Private Ovechkin.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.484
<i>You're awfully quiet.</i>

03:48.960 --> 03:51.566
<i>I wouldn't want to talk either,
if I was in your shoes.</i>

03:52.160 --> 03:55.767
We have photos of you
at Spider Raymond's club,

03:56.240 --> 03:58.447
a witness placing you
in a truck full of Nitramene,

03:58.520 --> 04:01.000
another witness who says
you were at the boat

04:01.160 --> 04:02.889
where Stark hid all of his toys.

04:04.240 --> 04:05.924
Then there's the dead bodies.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.090
Spider Raymond,

04:08.160 --> 04:10.970
Leet Brannis, Ray Krzeminski.

04:12.360 --> 04:15.523
You honestly think
I killed Agent Krzeminski?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.843
I mourned him with the rest of you.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.769
Yeah, I attended that performance.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.440
You're unbelievable.

04:21.519 --> 04:22.601
That's rich.

04:23.280 --> 04:24.884
That's rich, coming from you.

04:25.440 --> 04:28.205
I had your back for six months,

04:28.560 --> 04:30.369
while you were waiting
to plant a knife in mine.

04:31.560 --> 04:34.370
What? You want to pretend
we're still friends?

04:34.840 --> 04:36.888
We're pals? You want to talk?

04:38.320 --> 04:39.560
Talk about this.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.562
This is all very impressive,
Agent Sousa.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.681
You've assembled
a solid bit of evidence here.

04:47.520 --> 04:48.885
And I understand
that you never get the chance

04:48.960 --> 04:50.121
to run this far with the ball,

04:50.200 --> 04:51.884
so you're making the most
of your opportunity.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.846
But you are wasting precious time.

04:55.200 --> 04:56.964
There is a trained killer out there,

04:57.040 --> 04:59.441
<i>and she's a small player
in a bigger scheme.</i>

04:59.600 --> 05:01.648
<i>Someone else is pulling her strings.</i>

05:02.480 --> 05:05.245
 She is incredible.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.848
You confront her
with a wall of evidence,

05:07.920 --> 05:10.400
and she scales that wall.

05:10.760 --> 05:12.922
This woman is an excellent liar.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.363
Pathological, I would say.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.365
<i>My brain is melting.</i>

05:17.600 --> 05:19.045
I'm getting some coffee.

05:27.240 --> 05:29.527
Chief, we just got a call.

05:30.240 --> 05:33.084
There's been an accident.
Agent Yauch is dead.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.324
What? Yauch? How?

05:35.400 --> 05:36.606
He was hit by a truck.

05:37.920 --> 05:38.921
Good lord.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.163
The cops are saying
he'd come from a bar.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.604
I only knew him briefly,
but he seemed like good man,

05:46.080 --> 05:47.684
if a little emotional.

05:47.760 --> 05:48.921
What's he doing here?

05:50.880 --> 05:52.723
I was asked to sit in,

05:52.800 --> 05:56.088
in case Agent Carter
began speaking of Leviathan.

05:56.160 --> 05:57.844
You don't have to
explain yourself, Doctor.

05:58.080 --> 05:59.605
You got a problem with this,
Agent Thompson?

06:00.880 --> 06:02.120
No, sir.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.121
Unorthodox, is all.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.450
I should go back to your office.

06:07.560 --> 06:08.891
- That's not necessary.
- No.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.088
You men have enough to deal with.

06:11.160 --> 06:14.721
And I do not wish
to be source of agitation.

06:14.840 --> 06:18.128
Anyway, I do not think she will
be saying anything of relevance.

06:19.920 --> 06:21.888
Take him back, then warm up.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.207
I'm gonna put you back in there
for the full press.

06:25.120 --> 06:26.690
We need to turn up the heat.

06:30.480 --> 06:31.686
I'm confused.

06:32.320 --> 06:33.321
I'm sick.

06:33.920 --> 06:35.126
I'm impressed.

06:35.440 --> 06:38.489
You're good, Carter.
Holy cow, you are good.

06:38.880 --> 06:39.961
I got a dozen guys in there

06:40.040 --> 06:41.804
wish they could play the game
half as well as you.

06:41.920 --> 06:44.002
I'm not playing a game. I never was.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.411
Tell that to Krzeminski!

06:45.640 --> 06:47.802
You know, if you want to hit me,
now's your chance.

06:48.120 --> 06:49.451
I don't want to do that, Carter.

06:49.840 --> 06:51.285
Something's not right here.

06:51.680 --> 06:53.170
I saw what you did in Russia.

06:53.320 --> 06:56.688
<i>What you did for that mission,
what you did for me?</i>

06:58.640 --> 07:00.768
You saved my life. This doesn't add up.

07:00.840 --> 07:03.161
That's because I had nothing
to do with Krzeminski's death

07:03.240 --> 07:05.049
or the theft
of Howard Stark's inventions.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.531
"Theft"?

07:06.680 --> 07:09.160
Wow, he's really got you wrapped
around his finger, doesn't he?

07:09.280 --> 07:10.327
I got to give it to him.

07:10.440 --> 07:12.727
- He's as good as they say.
- "As good as they say"?

07:12.800 --> 07:14.882
He got in so deep,
he scrambled your brain.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.048
Howard Stark
has never scrambled my mind

07:17.120 --> 07:18.724
or any other part of me.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.131
Come off it, Carter.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.651
There is no harm in admitting

07:21.720 --> 07:25.327
that he and you
have a thing going on, or had.

07:25.600 --> 07:29.082
Because from the look of it,
Stark's hung you out to dry.

07:31.520 --> 07:32.885
Listen to me.

07:34.080 --> 07:35.491
You need to make a deal.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.650
Stark is the one we want.

07:38.720 --> 07:39.721
Just tell us about him.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.486
Save yourself.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.848
The only thing I could possibly
tell you about him

07:44.920 --> 07:47.048
is he is not the man you want.

07:47.560 --> 07:50.131
<i>But the SSR is myopic
when it comes to Howard Stark,</i>

07:50.240 --> 07:52.481
which is why I have been
conducting my own investigation.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.404
That's not entirely true.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.724
Before Sousa sniffed you out,

07:57.240 --> 07:59.208
we were starting to explore
other avenues.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.368
Then by all means,
let's stroll down another avenue.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.646
What would you like to discuss?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.161
Give us something.

08:06.560 --> 08:07.561
Anything.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.484
Tell me what you know
about this.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.086
What? You don't want to explain this?

08:15.760 --> 08:16.921
- Fine.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.364
Let's go a little further in the past.

08:20.520 --> 08:22.409
I want to talk about the Battle of Finow.

08:22.680 --> 08:24.967
Very well, but you'll be the one
that's doing all the talking,

08:25.040 --> 08:26.530
because I saw no action in Finow.

08:26.600 --> 08:27.886
That worked out good for you.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.844
Because most of the people
that served there are dead,

08:29.920 --> 08:31.809
except for a few
of your Russian buddies.

08:31.920 --> 08:33.365
You think you know me,

08:33.919 --> 08:36.890
but I've never been more than
what each of you has created.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.368
To you, I'm a stray kitten,

08:39.440 --> 08:41.602
left on your doorstep to be protected.

08:41.919 --> 08:44.446
The secretary
turned damsel in distress.

08:44.600 --> 08:45.840
The girl on the pedestal,

08:45.960 --> 08:48.440
transformed into some daft whore.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.210
<i>You're behaving like children.</i>

08:50.280 --> 08:51.611
What's worse, what's far worse,

08:51.680 --> 08:53.887
is that this is just shoddy police work.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.729
You were inches away
from the woman that you want

08:55.800 --> 08:57.211
when you loaded me into your car.

08:57.360 --> 08:59.089
You should be looking
for Dottie Underwood,

08:59.160 --> 09:01.128
who by now, I assume,
has shed her alias.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.805
Excuse me?

09:07.960 --> 09:09.405
I'd like to buy this carriage.

09:09.480 --> 09:12.324
Fine choice.
That's the one I'd buy for myself.

09:12.800 --> 09:13.926
Would you like me to wrap it up?

09:14.000 --> 09:16.446
No, thank you. It's not a gift.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.326
It's for me.

09:18.680 --> 09:21.411
- Oh, well, congratulations!
- Thank you.

09:21.480 --> 09:23.130
You'll want a blanket with that, right?

09:23.520 --> 09:24.601
Of course.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.967
Pink or blue?

09:28.560 --> 09:30.085
Let's go with pink.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.129
You must be getting a jump on things.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.043
You don't look like
you could be very far along.

09:35.120 --> 09:36.121
Hmm.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.162
It's coming sooner than you'd think.

09:40.480 --> 09:44.201
That deal I offered?
It's now off the table.

09:44.280 --> 09:46.169
That's fine. I wasn't going to take it.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.450
Any minute,
Dooley's gonna pull me out of here

09:49.520 --> 09:51.841
and ask me to do something
to you that I don't want to do.

09:52.480 --> 09:55.165
Peggy, you've watched
from the other side of that glass.

09:55.560 --> 09:57.528
You know what I am capable of.

09:59.160 --> 10:01.686
And you know what I'm capable of.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.331
- Number, please.

10:04.400 --> 10:05.686
- One moment.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.690
2704 Hillhurst is busy.

10:07.760 --> 10:09.125
I'll call you when the line is free.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.051
Pardon me.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.281
Uh...

10:14.480 --> 10:16.448
Sir. Can I help you?

10:16.520 --> 10:18.204
Yes. I'm looking for Chief Dooley.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.848
I'm sorry. I... I don't know who that is.

10:22.160 --> 10:23.446
Ah, he runs this operation.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.205
The SSR, that is.

10:25.760 --> 10:27.410
I've been here before for questioning.

10:27.840 --> 10:30.730
Sir, I wish that I could help you,
but we're very busy,

10:30.800 --> 10:32.882
and only authorized personnel
are allowed in here.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.361
Could you just punch him up
on your board

10:35.440 --> 10:37.408
and tell him that Edwin Jarvis is here...

10:38.840 --> 10:40.649
With the signed confession
of Howard Stark.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.007
Hold, please.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.846
It's all there. I can answer
any questions you may have.

10:57.080 --> 10:58.650
Agent Carter, are you all right?
Have they harmed you?

10:58.760 --> 11:01.366
She's fine. Now you've seen her.

11:01.560 --> 11:02.971
Can we get down to brass tacks?

11:03.200 --> 11:04.201
What is this man doing here?

11:04.280 --> 11:06.601
Pulling your fat
out of the fryer, apparently.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.969
I'm afraid the charade is over,
Agent Carter.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.527
Mr. Stark has decided to come clean.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.048
- What's that?
- Her boyfriend's confession.

11:14.120 --> 11:15.565
He owns up to everything.

11:15.640 --> 11:16.687
Jobbing his own vault,

11:16.760 --> 11:19.161
selling explosives,
the Roxxon implosion.

11:20.360 --> 11:21.441
Where's the man himself?

11:22.080 --> 11:23.445
Uh...

11:23.520 --> 11:26.410
Somewhere over Greenland,
scheduled to land in Teterboro

11:26.480 --> 11:27.970
at approximately 9:00 p.m. this evening.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.445
His attorneys have the signature page.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.488
It'll be sent back to you
as soon as you've agreed to his terms

11:31.560 --> 11:33.289
and Agent Carter and myself are free.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.330
Do I have a say in this matter?

11:35.400 --> 11:36.731
You've had plenty of chances to talk.

11:36.840 --> 11:39.207
- So, do we have a deal?
- Not quite.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.211
As tempting as this arrangement is,

11:43.280 --> 11:44.441
I'm not stupid.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.883
Even if this is true,
why would I give up Carter or you

11:46.960 --> 11:48.121
for a piece of paper?

11:48.360 --> 11:50.169
Uh, a signed piece of paper.

11:51.240 --> 11:53.242
No, she's staying here. So are you.

11:53.320 --> 11:54.890
I want the signature page delivered.

11:54.960 --> 11:57.930
When Stark lands, we bring him here,
have a garbage exchange.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.081
That's the deal.

12:02.120 --> 12:03.531
It would appear so.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.642
And for the record, I find you repulsive.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.561
Take off the cuffs.

12:11.640 --> 12:13.847
Howard can't do this. They'll never
clear his name if he turns up...

12:13.960 --> 12:16.281
You're not clearing anybody.
You're done.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.283
I don't think you've understood
our compromise

12:18.360 --> 12:19.600
regarding Agent Carter.

12:19.880 --> 12:21.405
Oh, she's free from prosecution.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.564
When Stark walks into the building,

12:23.680 --> 12:25.682
she walks out, for good.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.444
Carter, you're out of the SSR.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.488
Don't let her out of your sight.

12:46.160 --> 12:47.571
Didn't take you long
to clean out your desk.

12:50.360 --> 12:51.725
Your personal belongings?

12:52.760 --> 12:53.966
Two notebooks and a file.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.486
This one belongs
to the agency, actually.

12:58.200 --> 13:00.362
I am truly sorry about all of this.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.370
When you didn't meet me,
I knew the worst had happened,

13:02.440 --> 13:03.601
and I panicked.

13:04.360 --> 13:07.125
And I suppose the confession
portrays me as what? A patsy?

13:07.200 --> 13:08.804
A doe-eyed idiot
succumbed to the charms

13:08.880 --> 13:10.803
of America's mustachioed Casanova?

13:10.880 --> 13:12.325
That is the gist, yes.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.964
With a bankruptcy side plot
sprinkled on top

13:15.040 --> 13:16.804
to provide motive for Mr. Stark's deeds.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.485
Nice flourish.

13:19.040 --> 13:20.201
I hope you'll forgive me one day.

13:20.320 --> 13:21.526
There's nothing to forgive.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.804
You panicked and called for backup.

13:23.880 --> 13:25.723
It wasn't your line,
and you were trying to help me.

13:26.520 --> 13:28.010
And Howard stepping up
to his confession.

13:28.080 --> 13:30.606
I wouldn't have thought
he had the nobility in him.

13:31.840 --> 13:32.841
Yes...

13:36.000 --> 13:37.411
About that confession...

13:39.080 --> 13:41.686
Did Howard write that confession,
Mr. Jarvis?

13:42.240 --> 13:43.480
He did not.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.524
Did you

13:49.640 --> 13:51.768
write that confession, Mr. Jarvis?

13:53.080 --> 13:54.127
I did.

13:54.440 --> 13:55.487
Oh, flipping hell!

13:55.560 --> 13:58.882
I called for help many times.
Mr. Stark never answered.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.531
I left countless messages, nothing.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.170
So then I panicked and panicked again

14:02.240 --> 14:03.526
and put my own
particular skills to use...

14:03.600 --> 14:07.571
- Oh, for the love of God, man!
- As I said, panic was involved.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.085
I thought it would buy us time.

14:09.280 --> 14:10.566
We were closing in on the real culprit.

14:10.640 --> 14:12.722
I hoped that with a few more hours,
we would be able to prove

14:12.800 --> 14:14.882
Mr. Stark's innocence
and your competence.

14:14.960 --> 14:17.406
And when Howard
doesn't land in Teterboro,

14:17.480 --> 14:19.130
we shall both disappear.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.209
- Disappear?
- Until our trials.

14:21.440 --> 14:23.681
Most likely followed by
a decidedly severe punishment.

14:23.800 --> 14:26.121
Have you ever been hanged,
Mr. Jarvis?

14:26.440 --> 14:28.204
I can't say that I have, no.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.887
It is quite unpleasant.

14:37.120 --> 14:41.330
I know you're mad at me,
and maybe I got that coming.

14:45.360 --> 14:47.488
But I think if we're
being honest with each other,

14:47.560 --> 14:49.642
this mess was a long time
in the making.

14:51.160 --> 14:52.650
I'm not blaming you.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.491
Not anymore.

14:55.160 --> 14:58.801
I buried myself deep in this job
the day that I started.

14:59.840 --> 15:03.162
You got to know that
I only wanted the best for you.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.767
Can I come by and see you
and the kids and just talk?

15:10.120 --> 15:11.451
Dinner maybe?

15:12.000 --> 15:14.844
Yeah, yeah. I can sneak
out of here for an hour, yeah.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.166
I miss you, too.

15:17.760 --> 15:19.000
Bye.

15:30.160 --> 15:31.844
That sounded fruitful.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.365
It's a start.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.611
How do you feel?

15:38.560 --> 15:39.607
Uh...

15:39.680 --> 15:43.002
I don't know the word. I owe you.

15:43.440 --> 15:45.966
No. You don't owe me anything.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.691
I am happy just to be here
to be able to help you.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.885
I'm sure we could lure one of them in,

15:56.960 --> 15:58.564
get the drop on them,
steal a weapon and...

15:58.640 --> 15:59.641
"Get the drop on them"?

15:59.720 --> 16:02.610
You've been in custody all of an hour,
and you're Jimmy Cagney.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.201
Report.

16:06.480 --> 16:08.050
Is there no one here
who will listen to reason?

16:08.320 --> 16:10.800
I believe it's safe to say
I have no friends left at the SSR,

16:10.880 --> 16:12.086
not that I ever had any.

16:43.600 --> 16:44.761
"Prepare...

16:45.480 --> 16:46.891
"For...

16:47.720 --> 16:48.960
"Evacuation."

16:49.400 --> 16:51.607
- You know Morse Code?
- Your surprise wounds me.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.450
He's tapping out a timetable.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.931
"90 minutes."

16:58.560 --> 17:00.130
What happens in 90 minutes?

17:02.440 --> 17:03.851
Leviathan is coming.

17:08.680 --> 17:09.840
Chief Dooley?

17:10.119 --> 17:12.009
Chief Dooley,
I'd like to make a confession.

17:12.119 --> 17:13.609
I already got the confession I need.

17:13.720 --> 17:14.925
It's a fake.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.401
Why are you pulling this, Carter?

17:16.480 --> 17:17.720
Howard Stark isn't coming.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.962
The confession is a phony,
the signature a forgery.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.401
- Agent Carter...
- It's Miss Carter.

17:21.480 --> 17:23.642
I don't work here anymore,
but if you want a confession,

17:23.720 --> 17:25.801
if you want the truth,
I'm ready to give it to you.

17:29.440 --> 17:30.885
It killed me.

17:31.880 --> 17:32.927
I'd managed to discover

17:33.000 --> 17:34.843
all the remaining items
from Howard Stark's vault,

17:34.920 --> 17:37.321
and there was nothing
I could do about it.

17:37.920 --> 17:39.843
But I knew Agent Sousa
was working that day.

17:39.920 --> 17:41.888
At least he would get the credit.

17:42.640 --> 17:45.246
We left the ship
moments before you arrived.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.806
I didn't know what was going
to happen to Agent Krzeminski.

17:49.160 --> 17:51.401
I could have been more careful.

17:52.080 --> 17:53.570
I'm going to have to live with that.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.002
And why are you telling us this now?

17:56.480 --> 17:58.050
Because I need your trust

17:58.120 --> 18:00.726
if you're going to believe me
about Dr. Ivchenko.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.491
The evil enemy scientist.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.450
Yeah, he's a real killer.

18:05.200 --> 18:06.929
You can tell
by the way he rubs his nose.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.047
I know what I saw.

18:08.120 --> 18:11.124
He was communicating in Morse Code
with someone across the street,

18:11.200 --> 18:14.090
the southeast corner of the building,
at least 10 stories or higher.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.207
I saw it, too.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.771
Well, as long as you saw it, too...

18:17.000 --> 18:18.445
He was discussing
some kind of timetable.

18:18.520 --> 18:21.364
We have less than 90 minutes
before something's going to happen.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.680
We can't leave him on his own.

18:23.120 --> 18:25.043
He's a good man.
He's done nothing but help us.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.362
He has only been here for 48 hours.
We don't know him.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.045
Maybe not, but we know you.

18:32.120 --> 18:34.361
I'm supposed to believe
that you pulled off

18:34.440 --> 18:37.330
your own investigation
without any of us noticing?

18:37.840 --> 18:38.921
Why would you go through
all that trouble

18:39.000 --> 18:40.240
instead of coming to one of us?

18:40.400 --> 18:43.210
I conducted my own investigation
because no one listens to me.

18:43.840 --> 18:45.888
I got away with it
because no one looks at me,

18:45.960 --> 18:48.804
because unless I have your reports,
your coffee, or your lunch,

18:48.880 --> 18:50.041
I'm invisible.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.804
Forgive me for not getting all
pissy-eyed at your tale of woe,

18:56.040 --> 18:59.726
but your track record with the truth
hasn't been all that hot.

18:59.960 --> 19:01.962
So if all I've got to go on is your word...

19:02.040 --> 19:03.644
There is one more thing.

19:14.680 --> 19:17.331
You'll want to be careful with that.

19:17.560 --> 19:20.166
Does this stuff implode, explode...

19:20.760 --> 19:22.330
Spice up an Old Fashioned?

19:23.320 --> 19:25.084
That is the last remaining sample

19:25.160 --> 19:27.242
of Captain Steve Rogers' blood.

19:30.480 --> 19:31.606
Mr. Stark was afraid

19:31.680 --> 19:34.251
your scientists would squander
the remaining samples

19:34.360 --> 19:35.850
attempting to re-create the serum.

19:36.160 --> 19:37.685
Which they did,

19:37.760 --> 19:39.603
so I'm afraid you'll have to forgive him
for trying to protect

19:39.680 --> 19:41.762
the greatest scientific feat
of the 20th century.

19:42.240 --> 19:44.129
Howard didn't trust me with it, either.

19:44.360 --> 19:46.283
He lied about the contents
of the device.

19:46.480 --> 19:49.245
He nearly convinced me
that I was saving the city by stealing it.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.368
Is that why you kept it, because he lied?

19:51.600 --> 19:52.840
Maybe at first,

19:52.960 --> 19:56.169
or perhaps I didn't trust
our greatest capitalist with such a prize.

19:56.920 --> 19:59.446
But I couldn't bring it here, either.

20:00.440 --> 20:02.488
And for that, I don't have an answer.

20:04.200 --> 20:07.807
I suppose I just wanted
a second chance at keeping him safe.

20:19.440 --> 20:20.646
<i>I believe her.</i>

20:20.840 --> 20:23.127
Why? 'Cause she got all soft in there?

20:23.640 --> 20:25.529
How do we know it's not just an act?
We've all seen her chops.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.409
She came clean even though
she was halfway out the door

20:27.480 --> 20:28.641
with Stark's confession.

20:28.720 --> 20:31.121
If that confession was real,
but she's saying it isn't.

20:31.240 --> 20:32.480
By her own account,

20:32.880 --> 20:34.723
Carter would be back in cuffs
when Stark didn't show.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.484
She gave up Captain America's blood.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.525
I know that's big for her.
So do you, Jack.

20:39.440 --> 20:41.044
Big enough to relight
that torch you're carrying.

20:41.160 --> 20:43.003
Hey. I brought her down. Remember?

20:45.120 --> 20:46.963
I think she's telling the truth.

20:47.160 --> 20:50.084
What do you think, Chief?
Do you trust her?

20:50.840 --> 20:51.966
No.

20:52.520 --> 20:53.521
But I trust Sousa's gut.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.648
Take a couple of men across
the street and do a look-see.

20:55.720 --> 20:56.846
What about Ivchenko?

20:56.960 --> 20:58.564
I'll stay here and babysit the doctor.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.006
Do you mind closing that?

21:11.800 --> 21:13.040
Is everything okay?

21:13.320 --> 21:14.367
Sure.

21:14.960 --> 21:16.246
Just getting chilly in here.

21:16.520 --> 21:18.921
 Of course.

21:31.720 --> 21:34.007
I wanted to have discussion with you.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.127
What about?

21:35.200 --> 21:36.690
Your family situation.

21:36.760 --> 21:38.649
I want this dinner to be success.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.005
I don't want to talk about that right now.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.567
Please. Focus.

21:44.280 --> 21:46.521
Focus on the experience
you want to have

21:46.600 --> 21:49.410
and make that desire a reality.

21:50.680 --> 21:54.082
What would be
the perfect evening tonight?

21:59.360 --> 22:01.408
We used to have a tradition.

22:04.160 --> 22:07.050
We'd all cook together, even the kids.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.451
I'd roast a chicken.

22:10.880 --> 22:13.087
The one thing I can do in the kitchen.

22:14.040 --> 22:16.771
Loretta says it is the crowd pleaser,

22:16.880 --> 22:18.325
just to get a laugh out of me.

22:22.480 --> 22:23.891
You shouldn't be by the window.

22:23.960 --> 22:25.724
Don't worry about the window.

22:26.560 --> 22:28.927
Focus on what really matters.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.282
That bird's not gonna carve itself, hon.

22:34.880 --> 22:38.407
Your wife is beautiful.
Your whole family is.

22:39.920 --> 22:41.046
I know.

22:41.120 --> 22:42.724
It's nice to see you happy.

22:42.840 --> 22:44.968
I want you to enjoy yourself.

22:45.040 --> 22:46.326
Celebrate.

22:47.960 --> 22:49.450
Because after this,

22:49.840 --> 22:52.366
we have something very important
to take care of.

23:02.320 --> 23:03.401
Corcoran here.

23:03.480 --> 23:04.811
<i>Stairwell's clear.</i>

23:04.880 --> 23:06.166
Okay. Keep the exits covered.

23:06.280 --> 23:08.965
- Call it in if you
see anything suspicious.

23:09.040 --> 23:11.441
Hey, goes for you, too. Play it safe.

23:15.320 --> 23:16.481
You believe Carter?

23:17.760 --> 23:19.171
I do.

23:20.280 --> 23:21.645
Yeah, me, too.

23:22.800 --> 23:25.565
Look, if she's right
about the girl in her building,

23:26.360 --> 23:28.124
you run into her, do yourself a favor.

23:28.320 --> 23:30.607
- Start shooting, to kill.

23:31.120 --> 23:33.771
- I can handle myself.
- Sousa...

23:34.480 --> 23:35.481
I don't doubt that,

23:35.840 --> 23:38.525
but after seeing that kid
tear through us in Russia,

23:39.080 --> 23:41.242
I'd hate to tangle with one
that's all grown-up.

23:55.880 --> 23:58.281
- You two, with me, now.
- What's happened?

23:58.720 --> 24:00.882
 We can't talk here.
There's ears everywhere.

24:11.640 --> 24:12.721
Have we been compromised?

24:12.800 --> 24:14.040
Did they find something
across the street?

24:16.360 --> 24:17.361
Stop talking.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.442
Chief Dooley! Chief Dooley!

24:24.560 --> 24:26.130
Chief Dooley, please!

24:26.200 --> 24:27.486
She's just about ready to crack.

24:27.560 --> 24:28.721
Someone help!

24:29.200 --> 24:30.770
I give her five minutes.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.931
Listen up, gentlemen.

25:03.200 --> 25:05.123
There's been a security breach
in this laboratory.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.764
Some of you probably know
that Agent Carter

25:07.840 --> 25:10.081
has betrayed this agency
and, in the process,

25:10.200 --> 25:12.089
she managed to walk
out of the building with this.

25:12.400 --> 25:14.641
God knows what could have happened
if we hadn't recovered it.

25:15.480 --> 25:18.848
Best case, we have negligence
in dealing with sensitive materials.

25:18.920 --> 25:20.968
Worst case, espionage and treason.

25:21.560 --> 25:24.564
This lab is shut down
until the inquiry is complete.

25:24.760 --> 25:26.171
Everyone is to report
to holding room B...

25:26.240 --> 25:30.040
Chief Dooley,
I can vouch for everyone here...

25:30.120 --> 25:31.451
Save it for the interrogation room.

25:31.680 --> 25:32.966
Move out now.

25:45.520 --> 25:47.284
That was impressive.

25:48.520 --> 25:50.966
You have
a most commanding presence.

25:52.840 --> 25:56.242
Now, I want one of Stark's inventions,

25:56.320 --> 25:58.448
item 17.

25:59.880 --> 26:01.325
Please focus.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.450
Where would it be?

26:29.960 --> 26:31.291
Is that it?

26:31.400 --> 26:35.689
No. This is something
I have heard whispers of.

26:35.800 --> 26:38.485
 No, you must not touch it.

26:38.560 --> 26:40.324
It is more delicate than it looks.

26:42.480 --> 26:44.448
I am looking for a crate.

26:52.560 --> 26:54.210
Item 17, here it is.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.086
Yes.

27:18.040 --> 27:19.485
This is what I want.

27:37.400 --> 27:38.686
Freeze!

28:13.080 --> 28:14.491
It's her! She's...

28:16.120 --> 28:18.441
She's coming down the stairs,
and she's coming fast!

28:33.120 --> 28:36.203
Thank you so much, Chief Dooley.
You have been tremendous help.

28:36.640 --> 28:39.450
Now, my package.

28:40.400 --> 28:42.164
I feel like I should keep this.

28:45.480 --> 28:47.244
Just focus.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.567
We don't have much further to go.

28:55.560 --> 28:56.800
Take this.

28:57.360 --> 28:58.646
You know what to do.

28:59.800 --> 29:01.802
Your family is waiting.

29:02.320 --> 29:04.402
You want what you deserve, don't you?

29:05.680 --> 29:06.806
Of course.

29:10.960 --> 29:12.530
Then you must focus.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.687
Because our work here is not yet done.

29:28.960 --> 29:31.008
Agent down! We have an agent down!

29:42.560 --> 29:43.607
You're late.

29:43.680 --> 29:45.603
- We've been compromised.
- I know.

29:46.520 --> 29:47.885
It's irrelevant.

29:49.320 --> 29:50.970
Shall we proceed to the next phase?

29:51.040 --> 29:52.280
Not yet.

29:53.720 --> 29:56.041
It has been in storage
for quite some time.

29:56.120 --> 29:57.451
We must test it.

29:57.800 --> 29:59.211
But they know about us now.

29:59.280 --> 30:02.602
They will soon be far too busy
to concentrate on us.

30:18.160 --> 30:19.207
Please help!

30:19.680 --> 30:21.205
We're taken hostage in here!

30:21.440 --> 30:22.646
No one's coming.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.882
I know you may be universally
despised in this establishment,

30:24.960 --> 30:26.166
but they barely know me.

30:26.360 --> 30:27.361
Please help!

30:27.440 --> 30:28.726
Mr. Jarvis, how would you feel

30:28.800 --> 30:30.450
if we smashed that mirror
with this table?

30:33.640 --> 30:35.085
I would feel splendid about it.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.887
All right. We pick it up,
and then on the count of three...

30:37.960 --> 30:39.200
Battering ram.

30:47.920 --> 30:48.967
Ready?

30:49.080 --> 30:51.447
- One, two...
- One, two...

30:51.920 --> 30:53.206
Wait.

30:53.760 --> 30:55.762
What if there are people behind
this mirror that we're breaking?

30:55.840 --> 30:58.002
Then they may get hurt.
There will be a spray of glass.

30:58.440 --> 30:59.521
I see.

31:00.440 --> 31:02.488
- One, two...
- One, two...

31:03.200 --> 31:04.565
- Wait!

31:05.040 --> 31:07.441
What if these hypothetical people
behind the mirror have guns?

31:07.600 --> 31:10.126
Then we may get hurt.
There will be a spray of bullets.

31:11.440 --> 31:12.726
I see.

31:14.760 --> 31:17.366
- One, two...
- One, two...

31:17.680 --> 31:18.727
- Three.
- Three.

31:23.280 --> 31:25.487
No people. Everybody wins.

31:25.560 --> 31:26.891
I've just thought of something.

31:26.960 --> 31:28.041
We're still attached to a table.

31:28.120 --> 31:29.884
We are still attached to a table.

31:32.320 --> 31:34.322
What the hell is going on in here?

31:34.600 --> 31:36.090
Where is Chief Dooley?

31:46.960 --> 31:49.327
Your mother know
you're using tools at her table?

31:50.120 --> 31:51.804
I put newspaper down.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.570
Hmm.

31:53.880 --> 31:55.609
If you scratch the finish,

31:55.680 --> 31:57.842
I'll say a couple Hail Marys for you.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.763
All hell's breaking loose.

32:04.160 --> 32:05.764
What are you doing here so early?

32:05.880 --> 32:07.211
You said 5:00.

32:09.520 --> 32:10.931
What are you up to, Roger?

32:11.680 --> 32:12.966
Nothing.

32:13.600 --> 32:14.840
Just had to see you.

32:15.240 --> 32:16.844
So you just left?

32:18.400 --> 32:20.004
What happened?

32:20.920 --> 32:22.365
I screwed up, Loretta.

32:24.280 --> 32:26.442
We had a guy in custody,
and I let him go.

32:27.120 --> 32:29.646
Walked out of the building.
I just watched.

32:33.560 --> 32:34.800
What are you gonna do?

32:35.200 --> 32:36.645
I don't know.

32:38.200 --> 32:41.363
I feel like I should be angry, scared...

32:41.720 --> 32:44.200
Something, but I don't care.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.530
I just want to come home.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.325
Can I come home?

33:05.080 --> 33:06.889
Chief Dooley!

33:08.120 --> 33:09.565
Chief!

33:11.760 --> 33:12.921
You okay?

33:20.920 --> 33:22.046
Oh, my God.

33:23.160 --> 33:25.049
Very calmly now,
everybody stand clear, please.

33:25.120 --> 33:26.884
Miss Carter, stand clear.

33:26.960 --> 33:28.405
Mr. Thompson, stand back, please.

33:28.480 --> 33:29.720
He's gone, isn't he?

33:29.800 --> 33:31.040
What is that?

33:31.440 --> 33:33.920
That is the prototype
for a new system of armor.

33:34.600 --> 33:36.011
How do we get it off him?

33:36.320 --> 33:37.924
I'm afraid it's not that simple.
Please don't touch.

33:38.160 --> 33:40.686
It was intended to double
as a heat source,

33:40.760 --> 33:42.922
for use in the winter months
on the European front.

33:43.480 --> 33:46.529
Locking the armor ignites
a self-sustaining battery.

33:47.320 --> 33:50.244
But there's always a catch to this stuff,
isn't there?

33:50.520 --> 33:51.567
I'm afraid the energy source

33:51.640 --> 33:54.803
is experimental, powerful,
and incredibly flawed.

33:54.960 --> 33:57.884
It invariably overheats
with rather violent results.

33:58.800 --> 33:59.961
How violent?

34:00.120 --> 34:01.121
Explosive.

34:01.760 --> 34:03.125
Get the scientists.

34:48.960 --> 34:50.724
How you feeling, Chief?

34:52.400 --> 34:53.811
Burning up.

34:55.600 --> 34:57.125
He got in my head.

34:58.840 --> 35:00.922
He made me steal something
from the lab.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.650
You can't let him talk to you.

35:02.960 --> 35:05.486
If he starts talking to you, he got you.

35:05.840 --> 35:08.286
- These clasps...
- They're locked, as I said before.

35:08.360 --> 35:09.771
It's what activates the system.

35:10.520 --> 35:12.284
Tampering with them
trips a circuit to the battery

35:12.400 --> 35:13.640
and speeds up the reaction.

35:13.720 --> 35:14.881
What is this thing made out of?

35:15.040 --> 35:16.451
It's an alloy of Mr. Stark's creation.

35:16.520 --> 35:17.487
Can't you cut him out of this thing?

35:17.560 --> 35:18.607
I don't think we have the time.

35:18.720 --> 35:19.767
Tampering with the circuitry...

35:19.880 --> 35:22.201
Speeds up the reaction. I got it.

35:24.200 --> 35:26.806
Let's pack him with ice.
Perhaps we can cool the core.

35:26.880 --> 35:29.008
The armor is designed to be impervious
to all outside elements,

35:29.080 --> 35:30.570
whether it be artillery or temperature.

35:30.720 --> 35:33.485
- Damn you, Howard.
- My God, it's searing his skin.

35:33.560 --> 35:35.801
It's in the final stages.
We're running out of time.

35:36.160 --> 35:37.889
- I don't know what to do.
- What does that mean?

35:37.960 --> 35:40.566
It means that... I don't know what to do.

35:43.800 --> 35:45.290
I know what to do.

35:46.400 --> 35:47.561
Here, give me a hand.

35:48.040 --> 35:49.280
Give me a hand.

35:52.560 --> 35:54.927
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

35:56.960 --> 35:58.166
Tell...

35:58.680 --> 36:00.125
Tell my wife...

36:03.080 --> 36:05.845
Tell her I'm sorry I missed dinner.

36:08.920 --> 36:11.161
And you?

36:14.000 --> 36:17.641
Promise me you'll get
the son of a bitch who did this.

36:18.520 --> 36:19.851
Say it!

36:20.360 --> 36:21.600
We'll catch them.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.245
Attagirl.

36:28.960 --> 36:30.928
Chief!
Chief!

36:31.080 --> 36:32.206
Chief, don't!

36:59.360 --> 37:00.646
What happened?

37:02.440 --> 37:03.805
They got Chief.

37:07.800 --> 37:09.325
I did this.

37:10.200 --> 37:12.089
Ivchenko brought me to him

37:12.160 --> 37:13.969
so that I would bring him to the SSR.

37:14.280 --> 37:15.645
This is my fault.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.323
No, Miss Carter.

37:18.760 --> 37:20.489
This is not your fault.

37:21.520 --> 37:24.649
This is Mr. Stark's bloody inventions.

37:26.480 --> 37:28.005
You're right.

37:28.720 --> 37:31.963
Leviathan tasked Leet Brannis
to steal something.

37:32.200 --> 37:33.486
What was it?

37:35.520 --> 37:36.851
The blood.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.086
Well, that's just great.

37:51.160 --> 37:53.162
Screaming baby during the picture?

37:53.840 --> 37:54.841
Oh.

37:54.960 --> 37:57.361
Don't pay any attention to him, dear.

38:14.160 --> 38:17.164
<i>Dexter, dispose of your litter properly.</i>

38:17.600 --> 38:19.762
<i>Nah, let somebody else
pick it up.</i>

38:19.840 --> 38:22.684
<i>Dexter, what if everyone
threw their litter in the aisle?</i>

38:23.880 --> 38:25.928
<i>Hey! Let me down from here!
Let me down!</i>

38:26.000 --> 38:27.206
<i>Let me down!</i>

38:27.280 --> 38:29.044
<i>Remember, dispose of...</i>

38:34.720 --> 38:36.165
Do you think it will work?

38:36.520 --> 38:39.603
I have great faith
in Mr. Stark's inventions.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.364
We need to find out what Ivchenko took.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.604
Search every crate.

39:07.280 --> 39:09.851
Item 17. It's gone.

39:10.680 --> 39:12.967
All right. What's that do?

39:14.400 --> 39:15.765
I have no idea.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.090
Enough with the coughing already!

39:55.920 --> 39:59.003
Circling the block once or twice,
I understand.

39:59.240 --> 40:01.004
Three times? Fine.

40:01.240 --> 40:02.844
But six times?

40:03.120 --> 40:06.169
When there's a perfectly good
lot across the street.

40:06.480 --> 40:08.847
Now we're gonna miss
the start of the picture

40:09.040 --> 40:12.249
all because someone didn't
want to pay for parking.
