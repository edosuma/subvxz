I thought it was funny.

13:46.998 --> 13:50.865
Everybody else was laughing,
so I just kept walking.

13:50.931 --> 13:53.031
<i>Smiling.</i>
You walked away?

13:53.098 --> 13:58.765
<i>Yes. And he said,</i>
<i>"When she turns a cheek,</i>
<i>she really turns a cheek."</i>

13:58.831 --> 14:03.098
- Marsha, were you alone?
- No, I was with a man.

14:03.165 --> 14:07.831
I was on a first date.
It was very embarrassing
for him too.

14:07.898 --> 14:09.998
And then what happened?

14:10.065 --> 14:12.031
Well, he told me it was
nothin' to get upset about.

14:12.098 --> 14:15.665
And I tried to pretend
it didn't bother me.

14:15.731 --> 14:21.131
But... after the date,
I went home and I cried.

14:21.198 --> 14:22.931
And your date?

14:24.631 --> 14:26.598
I never saw him again.

14:26.665 --> 14:29.131
Marsha, here's the question.

14:30.465 --> 14:33.665
Why choose to relive this again
in a courtroom?

14:33.731 --> 14:38.965
I went to a state fair
on a Sunday afternoon.

14:39.031 --> 14:41.231
I was minding
my own business.

14:41.298 --> 14:44.231
And for the entertainment of
others, a carnival employee...

14:44.298 --> 14:48.298
started insulting
my physical appearance
for profit.

14:48.365 --> 14:51.465
I am not ashamed of
taking that seriously.

14:51.531 --> 14:54.765
When I walk
down a street...

14:54.831 --> 14:58.831
and people
yell things at me,

14:58.898 --> 15:02.198
the shame
should not be mine.

15:02.265 --> 15:04.665
It should be theirs.

15:08.365 --> 15:12.565
From the entry,
the knife was plunged in.

15:12.631 --> 15:16.698
It had to have had a certain
amount of velocity to it, there
was no mashing of the skin.

15:16.765 --> 15:18.798
By velocity, you mean?

15:18.865 --> 15:24.265
Like this.
It couldn't have happened
in a struggle the way he says.

15:24.331 --> 15:26.531
Are you sure?

15:26.598 --> 15:31.098
He describes a situation
in which both had their hands
on it and were pushing.

15:31.165 --> 15:35.798
I'm sorry, but you don't just
push a knife through a sternum.

15:35.865 --> 15:37.798
This was a massive blow.

15:37.865 --> 15:40.165
<i>It was no struggle.</i>

15:40.231 --> 15:43.031
Do you have an opinion
as to how Mr. Andleman
was stabbed?

15:43.098 --> 15:45.865
I do, based on the trajectory
of the wound.

15:45.931 --> 15:48.698
May I show you?
Of course.

15:48.765 --> 15:51.398
The victim was sitting.

15:51.465 --> 15:55.465
<i>The killer came up</i>
<i>from behind him</i>
<i>and over the top.</i>

15:55.531 --> 15:59.698
He drove the knife in...
like this.

15:59.765 --> 16:03.731
We're talking about
a lot of force here.

16:03.798 --> 16:08.565
Now the reason I have a problem,
Doctor, is that you're
completely wrong.

16:08.631 --> 16:10.565
And it leads me to ask...

16:10.631 --> 16:13.398
how many other people
have been falsely convicted
by your ridiculous theories?

16:13.465 --> 16:15.731
Objection.
Sustained.

16:15.798 --> 16:20.365
Okay, look, I'm not going to
debate you on forensics,
trajectory, velocity equations,

16:20.431 --> 16:23.298
because the truth is I know
nothing about any of it.

16:23.365 --> 16:25.931
But I certainly do know that
Marty Andleman didn't die
the way you say he did.

16:25.998 --> 16:28.365
- Objection.
- <i>Sustained.</i>

16:28.431 --> 16:32.198
You're not allowed to
give arguments at this point,
Mr. Heric. Just ask questions.

16:32.265 --> 16:36.898
Sir, in 1987, did you testify
against a man named
Alex Beauregard?

16:38.798 --> 16:42.398
- Yes.
- <i>Your testimony went to</i>
trajectory, angle of wound--

16:42.465 --> 16:45.331
- It was another
stabbing death, right?
- <i>Yes, I believe that's correct.</i>

16:45.398 --> 16:48.131
Mr. Beauregard
was convicted of murder
and sentenced to life in prison.

16:48.198 --> 16:52.998
- Yes.
- <i>Two years later, somebody else</i>
confessed to the crime.

16:53.065 --> 16:55.498
The conviction was overturned
and Mr. Beauregard was released.
Did you know that?

16:55.565 --> 16:57.665
Yes.

16:57.731 --> 17:01.231
And your analysis of wound
trajectory turned out to be
wrong in that case, didn't it?

17:01.298 --> 17:03.298
Yes.

17:03.365 --> 17:06.131
A crime you essentially
convicted him of
with your testimony.

17:06.198 --> 17:10.431
- So mistakes do happen.
- I'm not mistaken here,
Mr. Heric.

17:10.498 --> 17:13.265
Mistakes do happen.
Yes or no?

17:15.897 --> 17:19.397
- Yes.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

17:19.464 --> 17:23.365
Oh, one last question.
Did you ever apologize
to Mr. Beauregard?

17:23.431 --> 17:26.031
No.

17:26.098 --> 17:28.865
Gee.

17:38.598 --> 17:40.498
100,000,
that's as high as--
No.

17:40.565 --> 17:43.465
Look, bring it up to 200,000.
I'll try to sell it.
200,000?

17:43.531 --> 17:46.598
Look, you saw the faces
on the jury. They're not--
The jury hasn't heard our side.

17:46.665 --> 17:49.365
Fine. Well, tell 'em your side,
but 100,000's not enough.
We'll give you a quick answer.

17:49.431 --> 17:53.498
I gave him the answer.
We have to take the offer
to the client.

17:53.565 --> 17:56.265
We'll get right back to you.
Thanks.

17:57.531 --> 17:59.665
Don't you undermine me,
Lindsay.

17:59.731 --> 18:03.298
You can't reject an offer
without making the client
aware of it, Ellenor.

18:08.031 --> 18:10.465
We'll offer manslaughter,
eight years.

18:10.531 --> 18:13.531
What?

18:13.598 --> 18:17.898
Manslaughter.
It's a moral victory.
But it's not a victory.

18:17.965 --> 18:19.798
Well, it's as good
as it's gonna get.

18:19.865 --> 18:22.731
It's as good as you'll offer.
I'll get better.

18:22.798 --> 18:25.398
Manslaughter.
Yes or no?

18:25.465 --> 18:28.465
Gee. Decisions.
Decisions. No.

18:28.531 --> 18:30.398
[ Bobby ]
Joey!
I said no.

18:30.465 --> 18:32.398
Oh, geez.

18:36.998 --> 18:39.398
Are you crazy?
They're offering eight years.

18:39.465 --> 18:42.998
That's because
they know they've lost.
They still got a great case.

18:43.065 --> 18:45.231
And if you weren't in favor
of me going off to prison,

18:45.298 --> 18:48.498
I might actually
attach some credibility to
your insipid little opinions.

18:48.565 --> 18:51.465
Hey, you can do
what you want to do, but you
committed cold-blooded murder,

18:51.531 --> 18:53.965
and you get an offer
of manslaughter?

18:54.031 --> 18:57.398
As sick as you are,
you can't be that stupid.

18:57.465 --> 18:59.898
Stupid?

18:59.965 --> 19:02.998
Stupid would be
listening to you!

19:03.065 --> 19:05.831
Touch me again
and I will hurt you.

19:05.898 --> 19:08.931
You think I can't
or I won't,

19:08.998 --> 19:11.865
then, yeah,
you are stupid!

19:18.372 --> 19:20.239
I don't want her
on the case.
Hold on--

19:20.306 --> 19:23.306
No! I don't want her!
Fine. My malpractice premium
is high enough already.

19:23.372 --> 19:27.639
-Look, Lindsay, part of
negotiating a good settlement--
-Look, don't bully me, Ellenor.

19:27.706 --> 19:29.472
You know I'm right,
so don't even try--
That's enough!

19:29.539 --> 19:31.572
You know what?
You don't get it.

19:31.639 --> 19:33.706
That fat people
face a discrimination,
you just don't get it,

19:33.772 --> 19:37.839
and that is exactly why
Marsha is bringing this case,
so people like you <i>will</i> get it.

19:37.906 --> 19:40.006
- I'm a fat bigot now?
- <i>I didn't say that.</i>

19:40.072 --> 19:43.506
-Say it if you think it.
-But while we're launching
accusations of hypersensitivity.

19:43.572 --> 19:45.372
Oh, please.
Come on. We're all
on the same side here.

19:45.439 --> 19:48.172
You're in the middle of a trial.
Work it out.

19:48.239 --> 19:51.372
Both of you!
[ Door Opens, Closes ]

19:51.439 --> 19:54.139
Eugene. I need you with me
this morning too. Can you come?

19:54.206 --> 19:56.706
It's just for the day.
Sure.

19:58.106 --> 20:00.972
And according to Mr. Andleman's
life insurance policy,

20:01.039 --> 20:03.439
who would stand to inherit
in the event of his death?

20:03.506 --> 20:06.206
Uh, the defendant.
Joey Heric.

20:06.272 --> 20:08.639
And how much would he
stand to inherit, sir?

20:08.706 --> 20:11.806
$2.3 million.

20:11.872 --> 20:13.806
Thank you.

20:14.939 --> 20:16.839
<i>[ Judge ]</i>
<i>Mr. Heric?</i>

20:16.906 --> 20:18.839
No questions, Your Honor.

20:18.906 --> 20:20.972
<i>You may step down.</i>

20:21.039 --> 20:22.939
<i>Ms. Gamble?</i>

20:25.706 --> 20:28.739
Your Honor,
the Commonwealth
calls Joey Heric.

20:28.806 --> 20:32.672
- <i>[ Crowd Murmuring ]</i>
- Can she do that?

20:34.306 --> 20:36.572
Uh, Your Honor, could we
adjourn to chambers?

20:41.339 --> 20:46.039
I have a Fifth Amendment right
not to testify. She can't
call me as a witness.

20:46.106 --> 20:50.872
- He has testified, Your Honor,
he therefore waived his right.
- What are you talking about?

20:50.939 --> 20:56.072
Mr. Heric put facts
into evidence in his opening.
He told his side of the story.

20:56.139 --> 20:59.206
I'm entitled, therefore,
to cross-examine his version
of the events.

20:59.272 --> 21:02.172
Opening argument is not
evidence. I know that.
I'm not even a lawyer.

21:02.239 --> 21:06.339
But he used it
to get in evidence.
He testified in the narrative.

21:06.406 --> 21:08.672
Even so, I'm not inclined
to punish him for a mistake,

21:08.739 --> 21:12.606
- not when it comes to
his self-incrimination.
- A mistake?

21:12.672 --> 21:17.139
Come on.
Do we really think he didn't
know exactly what he was doing?

21:17.206 --> 21:19.539
He told his side of the story.

21:19.606 --> 21:23.872
And by not taking the stand,
he figured to shield himself
from cross-examination.

21:23.939 --> 21:26.172
That's the whole reason
he chose to represent himself.

21:26.239 --> 21:29.539
So he could testify and not be
subject to cross-examination.

21:29.606 --> 21:32.372
You give me
way too much credit.

21:32.439 --> 21:36.839
Your Honor, he said in his
opening that the evidencewill
show it was self-defense.

21:36.906 --> 21:40.272
The evidence <i>will</i> show that
Marty Andleman came at him.

21:40.339 --> 21:42.172
Where's that evidence
gonna come from?

21:42.239 --> 21:45.739
Mr. Heric, do you plan
to call witnesses
to put those facts in?

21:45.806 --> 21:48.339
How can I call witnesses?
I was the only one there.

21:48.406 --> 21:51.272
<i>Exactly. Making you</i>
<i>the only witness.</i>

21:52.739 --> 21:55.572
I think I agree with
the district attorney.

21:55.639 --> 21:58.739
You've put testimony
into this trial.
She can cross-examine.

21:58.806 --> 22:01.072
Your Honor--
That's what you get,
Mr. Heric,

22:01.139 --> 22:02.972
when you choose
to defend yourself.

22:03.039 --> 22:05.472
You've put yourself in a hole.
You'll have to dig yourself out.

22:05.539 --> 22:09.139
Fine.

22:09.206 --> 22:13.672
Helen, you come right at me.

22:20.706 --> 22:25.339
I won't deny the clown
is mean-spirited.

22:25.406 --> 22:29.039
The truth is, that's why
that booth draws the crowds,

22:29.106 --> 22:31.339
because the clown
is so outrageous.

22:31.406 --> 22:33.739
Does the carnival impose
any limitations?

22:33.806 --> 22:37.039
Certainly.
No, uh, obscene language.

22:37.106 --> 22:40.539
No picking on people
with disabilities,
no picking on kids.

22:40.606 --> 22:43.006
<i>Obviously, no racial</i>
<i>or religious remarks.</i>

22:43.072 --> 22:46.906
- But as to general physicality?
- Yes, it's really
all about that.

22:46.972 --> 22:52.172
The big nose, the bald head,
the bad figure,
the bad clothing.

22:52.239 --> 22:55.139
His job is to
antagonize the people...

22:55.206 --> 22:59.139
so that they become angry enough
that they want to dunk him.

22:59.206 --> 23:02.906
- <i>So you do draw limitations</i>
on what your clowns can say?
- Yes.

23:02.972 --> 23:06.906
And if my colleague
were to pass by, your clown
wouldn't remark on his race?

23:06.972 --> 23:10.772
No. He would probably go right
for that big bald head.

23:10.839 --> 23:12.939
<i>[ Ellenor ]</i>
<i>Come on. I've been to</i>
<i>a few comedy clubs.</i>

23:13.006 --> 23:16.372
I've heard some pretty
hard-biting racist humor
getting big laughs.

23:16.439 --> 23:19.306
I mean, if it's funny.
We wouldn't allow that.

23:19.372 --> 23:22.406
But why? Everybody knows
it's just a clown act.
What's the big deal?

23:22.472 --> 23:24.939
I see nothing funny
in racism.

23:25.006 --> 23:28.606
And I don't tolerate it
in any form at any one
of my carnivals.

23:28.672 --> 23:31.172
So you do see something funny
in fat people.

23:31.239 --> 23:34.239
You'll tolerate making fun
of fat people.

23:34.306 --> 23:37.439
Yes?
Yes.

23:37.506 --> 23:40.106
And, Mr. Johnson,
your tolerance of
this kind of abuse,

23:40.172 --> 23:43.972
is it that you're
unaware of the hurt you
cause to people like my client?

23:44.039 --> 23:47.572
Or is it that you just disregard
that kind of pain?

23:47.639 --> 23:50.139
We never meant to hurt
your client, Ms. Frutt.

23:50.206 --> 23:52.139
Are you aware that
you <i>did</i> hurt her?

23:52.206 --> 23:53.972
Obviously, we're aware now.

23:54.039 --> 23:56.739
And since you became aware of
it, that these words hurt,

23:56.806 --> 24:00.372
have you instructed your clowns
to stop ridiculing
fat people?

24:01.606 --> 24:03.572
No.

24:06.039 --> 24:10.839
Her whole plan will be
to get to that other murder.
The judge suppressed that.

24:10.906 --> 24:14.672
But if she somehow gets you
to open a door on it,
she can get it admitted.

24:14.739 --> 24:16.506
What do you mean
"open the door"?

24:16.572 --> 24:19.939
Well, she'll ask,
"What do you mean
Marty had a temper?"

24:20.006 --> 24:23.072
She wants you to answer
that he threatened
to kill Peter Fineman.

24:23.139 --> 24:26.806
If you give any inkling
of anything to do
with that other case,

24:26.872 --> 24:29.372
it'll get in.

24:29.439 --> 24:31.406
The jury will learn that you
killed somebody else.

24:31.472 --> 24:33.539
And if that happens, you can
kiss your ass good-bye, Joey.

24:35.839 --> 24:39.772

24:49.406 --> 24:51.572
Any evidence
that Mr. Andleman
could be homicidal?

24:51.639 --> 24:54.272
You heard his own
psychiatrist say so.

24:54.339 --> 24:56.206
Yes, well, any other evidence?

24:56.272 --> 24:58.606
Did you ever see such
homicidal tendencies?

24:58.672 --> 25:00.572
Yes.
When?

25:00.639 --> 25:03.739
- The night he tried to kill me.
- The night you killed him?

25:03.806 --> 25:05.439
In self-defense.

25:05.506 --> 25:07.706
Did he ever threaten
to kill you before?
<i>No.</i>

25:07.772 --> 25:10.406
Did he ever threaten
to kill anybody else?

25:10.472 --> 25:13.439
I believe for the purpose
of this trial, the judge has
instructed us not to talk...

25:13.506 --> 25:19.006
about any other occasion where
he may have or may have not
threatened to kill anybody else.

25:19.072 --> 25:20.806
That's right.

25:20.872 --> 25:24.639
You say he came at you
with the knife?
<i>Yes.</i>

25:24.706 --> 25:27.306
- And you thought
he would kill you.
- Yes.

25:27.372 --> 25:30.439
So you decided
to kill him instead.
Well--

25:30.506 --> 25:33.172
- You didn't first try to
get the knife away?
- Yes, I did, but I couldn't.

25:33.239 --> 25:35.072
And you struggled.
Yes.

25:35.139 --> 25:39.106
Tell me, at what point
during the struggle
did you say to yourself,

25:39.172 --> 25:41.172
"I'm going to kill him?"

25:41.239 --> 25:43.639
I never decided
to kill him, Ms. Gamble.

25:43.706 --> 25:46.906
My intent was for him
not to kill me.

25:46.972 --> 25:49.906
-Yes, and to accomplish that
you decided you would kill him.
-That isn't so.

25:49.972 --> 25:52.572
Mr. Heric, you said yourself
you intended to kill him.

25:52.639 --> 25:54.572
<i>I never said</i>
<i>any such thing.</i>
You grabbed the knife.

25:54.639 --> 25:57.006
I said I killed him
in self-defense.

25:57.072 --> 26:00.472
Yes, and that
is a deliberate act.
You deliberately killed him.

26:00.539 --> 26:02.806
It was a struggle.
Are you listening?

26:02.872 --> 26:04.939
Mr. Heric, you can't
have it both ways.

26:05.006 --> 26:09.106
Were you trying to
wrestle the knife away
or were you trying to kill him?

26:09.172 --> 26:11.672
<i>I was trying to</i>
<i>wrestle the knife away</i>
<i>when it went into him.</i>

26:11.739 --> 26:14.672
- You thrust it into him.
- It went into him
during the struggle.

26:14.739 --> 26:18.339
- It went in by accident?
- Yes. I never intended
to kill him.

26:18.406 --> 26:20.372
How many ways
can I say it?

26:20.439 --> 26:22.939
You said it perfectly.

26:30.806 --> 26:34.539
Have you ever stabbed
and killed anybody else,
Mr. Heric?

26:36.006 --> 26:40.139
<i>Did you not hear</i>
<i>my question, Mr. Heric?</i>
Your Honor--

26:40.206 --> 26:44.339
Your Honor, you ruled if he
argued accident, the other
case would be admissible.

26:44.406 --> 26:47.539
- Well, he just argued accident.
- Objection.

26:47.606 --> 26:50.906
- I'll allow it.
- Now wait a second!
- Mr. Donnell, sit down.

26:50.972 --> 26:54.206
Have you ever killed anybody
else by stabbing, Mr. Heric?

26:54.272 --> 26:59.239
- That's suppressed.
Your Honor, that's suppressed.
- Not anymore.

26:59.306 --> 27:02.239
Did you kill a former lover
by stabbing him in the chest
with a knife?

27:02.306 --> 27:04.472
Yes or no, sir?

27:04.539 --> 27:07.972
All right.
Well, I'll just keep asking
until I get an answer.

27:08.039 --> 27:12.972
Did you kill a former lover
by stabbing him to his death
with a kitchen knife?

27:13.039 --> 27:15.472
- <i>Did you kill a former lover--</i>
- I plead the Fifth Amendment.

27:15.539 --> 27:19.706
<i>Oh, you can't do that, sir.</i>
<i>See, you were already</i>
<i>granted immunity on that,</i>

27:19.772 --> 27:22.872
<i>so the Fifth Amendment</i>
<i>isn't available to you now.</i>

27:22.939 --> 27:25.039
Let me ask again.

27:25.106 --> 27:29.972
Did you kill City Councilman
Peter Fineman by stabbing him to
his death with a kitchen knife?

27:30.039 --> 27:34.706
- Yes or no?
Did you kill--
- I don't remember.

27:34.772 --> 27:37.672
You don't remember?

27:39.306 --> 27:41.939
Did you testify under oath
that you killed him?

27:46.139 --> 27:48.272
Yes.

27:49.806 --> 27:52.272
Your Honor, I have
no more questions.

28:01.739 --> 28:04.306
[ Judge ]
Mr. Heric,
you may step down.

28:07.472 --> 28:10.239
Mr. Heric,
you may step down.

28:10.306 --> 28:13.206
I think I should tell now.

28:13.272 --> 28:16.206
- Could we adjourn, please?
- I want to tell!

28:16.272 --> 28:18.206
Your Honor?

28:18.272 --> 28:22.406
Mr. Heric, do you know
where you are?

28:22.472 --> 28:24.906
I'm in deep trouble.

28:27.306 --> 28:29.406
I want to tell.

28:29.472 --> 28:34.406
<i>I did kill Peter Fineman.</i>

28:34.472 --> 28:36.839
<i>But I didn't kill Marty.</i>

28:38.072 --> 28:39.972
He killed himself.

28:41.539 --> 28:44.272
[ Judge ]
I beg your pardon?

28:44.339 --> 28:46.906
He framed me.

28:46.972 --> 28:50.972
That would be going to
some length to get somebody
in trouble, don't you think?

28:52.906 --> 28:57.772
We were breaking up.
But I was leaving him.

28:57.839 --> 29:01.572
He picked up the kitchen knife
and he started laughing.

29:02.806 --> 29:05.272
"They're all gonna think
you did it, Joey.

29:06.339 --> 29:08.239
"You killed Peter this way.

29:08.306 --> 29:12.272
"And when they find me
in your apartment
with a knife in my chest,

29:12.339 --> 29:15.872
<i>they'll all blame you."</i>

29:15.939 --> 29:18.572
<i>And he laughed some more.</i>

29:18.639 --> 29:22.206
"You'll never get
the insurance money...

29:22.272 --> 29:26.239
"because they'll
all think you did it,
and you'll be in jail.

29:26.306 --> 29:30.206
<i>And even if they learn</i>
<i>the truth, my insurance</i>
<i>doesn't cover suicide."</i>

29:30.272 --> 29:32.472
And he smiled at me.

29:35.239 --> 29:39.372
And he said,
"I finally got you, Joey.

29:39.439 --> 29:43.739
I bested you.
I win. You lose."

29:46.872 --> 29:51.939
And with that,
he thrust the knife
into his chest.

29:56.006 --> 30:00.606
Then why--
why did you claim
it was self-defense?

30:00.672 --> 30:02.572
Nobody beats me.

30:04.739 --> 30:07.839
I wasn't going to
let him win.

30:09.672 --> 30:13.572
<i>Self-defense,</i>
<i>I still get the money.</i>

30:13.639 --> 30:17.939
But even if I didn't,
I wasn't gonna let you win.

30:23.639 --> 30:26.939
Y-Your Honor, we need to
call one more witness.

30:27.006 --> 30:29.906
I couldn't let him win.

30:37.756 --> 30:42.656
When you form a conclusion
about people based
on appearance,

30:42.722 --> 30:46.256
it's bigotry,
it's prejudice.

30:46.322 --> 30:49.189
And as politically correct
as this country has become,

30:49.256 --> 30:51.456
the prejudice
against fat people,

30:51.522 --> 30:54.322
well, that one's
not so bad, is it?

30:54.389 --> 30:56.789
I mean, we're to blame.
It's our own fault.

30:56.856 --> 31:01.289
We must eat too much,
we're lazy, we're not
disciplined, we're sloppy.

31:01.356 --> 31:03.356
You know, I was at
a movie theater once,

31:03.422 --> 31:06.956
and they showed a fat person
at the beach in a bathing suit.

31:07.022 --> 31:10.256
And the audience openly
cringed and groaned.

31:10.322 --> 31:15.189
And nobody, nobody
was ashamed to do so.

31:15.256 --> 31:19.356
You see, every billboard,
every fashion magazine...

31:19.422 --> 31:21.789
tells us to be ashamed
of our bodies.

31:21.856 --> 31:24.856
Be thin. Be thin.

31:24.922 --> 31:28.189
<i>Would my client</i>
<i>like to be thinner?</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

31:28.256 --> 31:30.122
I can tell you
I certainly would.

31:30.189 --> 31:35.622
Does she struggle with
her weight? I don't know.
I can tell you I do.

31:35.689 --> 31:41.389
But does that mean
we should be ashamed of
our bodies? Absolutely not.

31:41.456 --> 31:45.856
I don't expect the bigotry
to end with the wave of a wand.

31:45.922 --> 31:48.189
It has been going on
for so long.

31:48.256 --> 31:52.156
It's gonna take
a long time to stop it.

31:52.222 --> 31:56.522
But if we are to stop it,
we need a beginning.

31:56.589 --> 31:59.122
For somebody, one jury,

31:59.189 --> 32:03.556
to say that it is prejudice,
and that it is not okay.

32:06.022 --> 32:10.589
This is a very,
very brave woman.

32:10.656 --> 32:13.156
I so admire her.

32:15.756 --> 32:20.456
And I promise you it was
not easy for her to come
into this courtroom--

32:26.489 --> 32:29.389
Please help her
to give the courage
to other fat people...

32:29.456 --> 32:33.689
to stand up
and say "enough."

32:34.989 --> 32:37.289
Enough.

32:40.722 --> 32:44.189
Well, we seem to sue
over everything these days,
don't we?

32:44.256 --> 32:47.722
Wrongful termination.
Sexual harassment.

32:47.789 --> 32:52.056
Now it's just insults.

32:52.122 --> 32:55.589
What about the Little League
game where the third baseman
taunts the batter?

32:55.656 --> 32:58.756
<i>And what about the movie</i>
<i>that shows the fat woman</i>
<i>on the beach?</i>

32:58.822 --> 33:02.922
What about the movies and the--
and the TV shows that ridicule
someone's appearance?

33:02.989 --> 33:04.956
What are we gonna do?

33:05.022 --> 33:07.889
Shut them down?

33:07.956 --> 33:12.056
The cattlemen sued Oprah...

33:12.122 --> 33:14.656
for criticizing a hamburger.

33:14.722 --> 33:18.122
<i>Where and when is</i>
<i>this going to stop?</i>

33:18.189 --> 33:20.989
<i>I don't like</i>
<i>the clown bit.</i>

33:21.056 --> 33:23.122
I thought
it was insensitive.

33:24.689 --> 33:29.689
But this guy
was dressed up
as a clown.

33:29.756 --> 33:34.689
This running off to court
every time your feelings
are hurt? Come on.

33:36.356 --> 33:39.989
We're becoming
a nation of victims.

33:40.056 --> 33:42.689
<i>Who's next?</i>

33:50.556 --> 33:54.122
You have to trust me now, Joey.
I'm taking over.

33:54.189 --> 33:56.756
I call the shots
and you have to trust me.

33:56.822 --> 33:58.722
Why do you even
want to help me?

33:58.789 --> 34:02.489
I'm not sure that I even do.
But I'm on this case,

34:02.556 --> 34:05.422
and I have to
make the legal decisions
that I think are necessary.

34:05.489 --> 34:08.322
Now, Dr. Jordan.

34:08.389 --> 34:12.755
He won't agree to testify
unless you wear hand
and leg restraints.

34:12.822 --> 34:14.789
Why?

34:14.856 --> 34:18.022
He doesn't think that
you'll be able to tolerate
some of his testimony.

34:23.956 --> 34:28.156
[ Bobby ] How long did you
treat Joey Heric?
Mmm, almost six years.

34:28.222 --> 34:31.722
Is it possible
that the man sitting there...

34:31.789 --> 34:36.889
would rather face murder charges
than admit he was outsmarted?

34:36.956 --> 34:41.289
<i>Not only is it possible,</i>
<i>I would consider it</i>
<i>almost probable.</i>

34:41.356 --> 34:43.289
[ Bobby ]
What kind of narcissism
are we talking about here?

34:43.356 --> 34:46.589
The same kind of narcissism that
prevented you raising insanity.

34:46.656 --> 34:50.621
This man needs to believe
he is mentally superior.
Look at him.

34:50.688 --> 34:54.656
<i>He sits there, half-dead,</i>
<i>not because he's looking</i>
<i>at a conviction,</i>

34:54.722 --> 34:56.422
<i>he probably doesn't</i>
<i>even care about that.</i>

34:56.489 --> 35:01.689
He's near catatonic because
that woman tricked him.

35:01.756 --> 35:04.989
<i>She outmaneuvered him</i>
<i>on this witness stand.</i>

35:05.056 --> 35:11.022
Any punishment you give him
won't be as bad as what
he's suffering right now.

35:12.789 --> 35:14.756
This is a bit much for me.

35:14.822 --> 35:16.722
I don't doubt that.

35:16.789 --> 35:22.522
The man's willing to risk
a life term in prison
rather than just say,

35:22.589 --> 35:26.156
"Gee, my lover one-upped me
by trying to kill himself"?

35:26.222 --> 35:29.622
Trying to make sense of him
is futile, Ms. Gamble.

35:29.689 --> 35:34.422
He has an acute
narcissistic disorder.
He needs to win.

35:34.489 --> 35:40.256
- And would that need to win
apply to this trial, Doctor?
- Excuse me?

35:40.322 --> 35:42.589
Wouldn't Joey feel
an overwhelming need
to win this trial?

35:42.656 --> 35:44.856
<i>Yes, he would.</i>

35:44.922 --> 35:48.722
- And he's a brilliant man,
isn't he?
- He's a genius.

35:48.789 --> 35:54.189
Given his genius and his need
to win, is it possible,
after I caught him on the stand,

35:54.256 --> 35:56.489
is it possible
that he manufactured...

35:56.556 --> 35:59.289
this wonderful story
about Marty killing himself?

36:01.789 --> 36:04.689
That is possible.

36:04.756 --> 36:09.656
Does it have to make sense,
this kind of narcissistic
disorder?

36:09.722 --> 36:12.456
It defies sense or logic.

36:12.522 --> 36:18.189
As Dr. Jordan testified,
a narcissist can't bear
criticism of any kind.

36:18.256 --> 36:21.456
Imagine when the man he loved
looked him in the eye,
smiled at him and said,

36:21.522 --> 36:25.689
"I've outsmarted you.
I schemed you out of
your insurance money.

36:25.756 --> 36:27.989
I beat you."

36:28.056 --> 36:31.622
This man doesn't lose.

36:31.689 --> 36:33.956
[ Helen ]
No, he doesn't.

36:34.022 --> 36:36.989
And he wasn't going to
lose this one, was he?

36:37.056 --> 36:41.456
He orchestrated
an immunity agreement
after the first murder.

36:41.522 --> 36:43.556
And here he is today,

36:43.622 --> 36:48.122
<i>suddenly saying</i>
<i>that the second victim</i>
<i>took his own life.</i>

36:48.189 --> 36:51.022
Maybe his best
mind game of all.

36:51.089 --> 36:53.422
[ Bobby ]
Well, how can anybody be sure?

36:53.489 --> 36:57.056
You heard his story,
it sounded real and he was
the only one there.

36:57.122 --> 37:02.456
And his treating doctor said
his story is not only possible,
it is probable.

37:03.656 --> 37:05.456
Probable.

37:05.522 --> 37:10.689
And the victim's doctor
testified that Marty Andleman
didshow suicidal tendencies.

37:10.756 --> 37:12.689
You heard that.

37:12.756 --> 37:17.256
[ Helen ] Joey Heric laughed
after the first murder.
He's laughing at me now.

37:17.322 --> 37:22.022
The only remaining question:
Does he get to laugh at you?

Thank you, Robert.

40:23.456 --> 40:27.822
Elsewhere today,
a fiery mid-air collision
took the life of--

40:27.889 --> 40:31.822
Maybe I should keep
some of this stuff.
Souvenirs.

40:31.889 --> 40:34.222
Research, in case
I ever need it again.

40:34.289 --> 40:37.689
Joey... get some help.

40:39.289 --> 40:41.222
It's just so hard
to find, Bobby.

40:41.289 --> 40:44.622
Well...
still here.

40:44.689 --> 40:47.456
Thought you'd be out
placing a personal by now.

Cute.

Kinda gets you right here,
doesn't it?

40:59.322 --> 41:01.489
I know you're a murderer.

41:01.556 --> 41:06.222
Yes. But do you <i>know</i>
I killed Marty?

41:06.289 --> 41:09.156
<i>I'll tell you this,</i>
<i>Dorothy.</i>

41:09.222 --> 41:14.056
When you had me on the stand,
you really had me.

41:14.122 --> 41:16.589
I got sexually stimulated
a little.

41:16.656 --> 41:21.456
Yeah, I could have wanted to
deny that Marty killed himself.

41:21.522 --> 41:26.656
That I couldn't bear
the idea of losing to him.
Oh, you're right.
