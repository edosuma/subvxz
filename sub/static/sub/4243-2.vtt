00:00.028 --> 00:02.226
<i>So here's what you missed
on </i> Glee: <i>Rachel's in New York,</i>

00:02.267 --> 00:04.271
<i>and her new friend Brody is way
hot, but Finn's still M.I.A,</i>

00:04.272 --> 00:06.250
<i>and her dance teacher Cassandra
totally hates her guts.</i>

00:06.251 --> 00:07.916
<i>Thank God Kurt showed up,
so now they can be classic</i>

00:07.917 --> 00:09.387
<i>New York roommates and shop
for shoes and stuff.</i>

00:09.388 --> 00:11.250
<i>There's a new girl
in Glee Club named Marley,</i>

00:11.251 --> 00:12.641
<i>and she could be
the next big thing.</i>

00:12.642 --> 00:14.329
<i>So could this kid Jake,
and it turns out he's Puck's</i>

00:14.330 --> 00:16.274
<i>half brother and Puck totally
doesn't know about him.</i>

00:16.276 --> 00:17.431
<i>And that's what you
missed on </i> Glee.

00:22.302 --> 00:25.251
<i>My name is Brittany S. Pierce,</i>

00:25.252 --> 00:26.308
<i>and I finally know
how Jesus feels</i>

00:26.309 --> 00:28.300
<i>in his house way up
at the North Pole,</i>

00:28.301 --> 00:30.285
<i>because I am on top
of the world.</i>

00:30.286 --> 00:32.250
<i>Senior year was awesome,</i>

00:32.252 --> 00:35.272
and now I get to relive
every minute of it.

00:35.273 --> 00:37.288
I'm head Cheerio!,
vice-Rachel of the glee club,

00:37.289 --> 00:38.308
and now I'm planning

00:38.309 --> 00:39.329
a Middle East style

00:39.330 --> 00:41.258
sham election
that will install me

00:41.259 --> 00:42.331
as senior class president
for life.

00:42.332 --> 00:45.255
Brittany, who are
you talking to?

00:45.256 --> 00:47.288
I thought I was doing
a voice-over.

00:47.289 --> 00:49.330
Okay.

00:49.331 --> 00:52.301
<i>It was kind of a rough summer.</i>

00:52.302 --> 00:55.272
<i>I really miss Santana, but...</i>

00:55.273 --> 00:57.284
<i>for now,
all I have to say is...</i>

00:57.285 --> 00:59.256
It's Brittany, bitch.

Brittany, my office... now!

02:53.247 --> 02:55.318
Brittany, I'm afraid it's
time for a little tough love.

02:55.319 --> 02:57.259
I hold in my hand
the most recent

02:57.260 --> 02:59.317
algebra test of one
Becky Jackson.

02:59.318 --> 03:01.246
Our plucky little Ewok

03:01.247 --> 03:03.292
waddled her way
to a respectable C-plus.

03:03.293 --> 03:05.326
Now, your performance,

03:05.327 --> 03:07.267
very same exam,

03:07.268 --> 03:09.284
unearthed the hitherto

03:09.285 --> 03:11.276
undiscovered grade...

03:11.277 --> 03:12.243
F-minus.

03:12.244 --> 03:14.242
You answered
every question with

03:14.243 --> 03:17.242
"see other side,"
where you composed

03:17.243 --> 03:20.238
an elaborate crayon-scape
entitled "Happyville."

03:20.239 --> 03:22.242
"The town where math
was never invented."

03:22.243 --> 03:23.381
Yeah, that's me,
and that's Santana,

03:23.382 --> 03:25.301
and that's Kurt
and Rachel in Heaven.

03:25.302 --> 03:28.243
- And, look, that's you.
- Brittany,

03:28.244 --> 03:30.237
You're a terrible role model
for the Cheerios!

03:30.238 --> 03:31.279
Last year, I was lost in a haze

03:31.280 --> 03:33.260
of pregnancy hormones,
and I allowed

03:33.261 --> 03:36.242
your record breaking
GPA to slide.

03:36.243 --> 03:38.237
The Cheerios! Grade
point average has dropped

03:38.238 --> 03:40.233
three full points.
My girls no longer see

03:40.234 --> 03:41.423
academic achievement
as a worthy goal,

03:41.424 --> 03:43.242
and yesterday I caught

03:43.243 --> 03:44.888
one of them trying
to marry a squirrel.

03:44.889 --> 03:46.312
That's 'cause I believe
in marriage equality

03:46.313 --> 03:47.431
- for all land mammals.
- Brittany,

03:47.434 --> 03:49.255
You're off the Cheerios!

03:49.256 --> 03:50.312
I'm giving
the top spot to Kitty.

03:50.313 --> 03:52.233
I'm afraid you're
going to have to

03:52.234 --> 03:53.243
lose the high pony.

03:53.244 --> 03:55.243
Tough love feels
a lot like "mean."

03:55.268 --> 03:57.635
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

03:59.323 --> 04:02.280
Britt, I'm so sorry
Sue was so mean to you.

04:02.281 --> 04:04.239
I wish I was there
to make it all better.

04:04.240 --> 04:05.255
Yeah, me too.

04:05.256 --> 04:06.608
Do you think we could
scissor-Skype later?

04:06.609 --> 04:08.321
I've got cheer practice
every night till midnight,

04:08.322 --> 04:09.327
until homecoming.

04:09.328 --> 04:12.317
Look, I love you, Britt,
but I'm so late.

04:12.318 --> 04:13.331
I got to go, okay?

04:13.332 --> 04:15.297
- I'll text you if we get a break.
- Okay.

04:15.298 --> 04:16.297
Have fun.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.327
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

04:20.267 --> 04:21.317
I'm not speaking to you.

04:21.319 --> 04:23.288
I know you joined a gang.

04:23.289 --> 04:25.288
The tango.

04:25.289 --> 04:27.266
You have to have it
in your arsenal, people.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.531
The first thing you
need to understand is

04:28.532 --> 04:30.267
it's all about sex.

04:30.268 --> 04:32.267
When you are dancing
the tango with someone,

04:32.268 --> 04:34.246
you're seducing them.
Partner up.

04:34.247 --> 04:36.306
We're gonna start
with <i>abrazo, </i> the embrace.

04:37.310 --> 04:39.259
Not you, Schwimmer.

04:39.260 --> 04:41.268
Keep practicing those
jazz hands back in the corner.

04:41.269 --> 04:43.288
Wait... but I...
Ms. July...

04:43.289 --> 04:45.309
I'm sorry, um...

04:45.310 --> 04:47.242
if I'm ever gonna play Evita,

04:47.243 --> 04:48.402
I'm gonna have to
learn how to tango.

04:48.403 --> 04:51.242
We're short a boy,
so a girl needs to sit out.

04:51.243 --> 04:53.309
And you don't have
enough sex appeal

04:53.310 --> 04:55.238
to pull off a credible tango.

04:55.239 --> 04:56.529
You're awkward and
tentative in your body,

04:56.530 --> 04:58.318
and you move like
you're ashamed of it.

04:58.319 --> 05:00.242
Arms up!

05:00.243 --> 05:03.238
Ready? Five, six,
seven, eight.

05:03.239 --> 05:05.296
One, two, three, four,

05:05.297 --> 05:07.235
five, six, seven, eight.

05:08.235 --> 05:09.241
Sorry I'm late.

05:09.242 --> 05:10.306
Someone stole my compass.

05:10.307 --> 05:12.306
I can't wear my Cheerios!
Uniform anymore,

05:12.307 --> 05:15.238
so I got this outfit
in the lost and found.

05:15.239 --> 05:16.256
Take a seat, Britt.

05:20.310 --> 05:22.264
Am I getting kicked off
the glee club, too?

05:22.265 --> 05:23.284
Of course not.

05:23.285 --> 05:25.256
- We're just really concerned about you.
- Yeah.

05:25.259 --> 05:27.255
Um... Brittany,

05:27.256 --> 05:29.267
you know you've had
some setbacks lately,

05:29.268 --> 05:31.284
and, um, it looks like
you might be feeling

05:31.285 --> 05:32.318
a little bit blue.

05:32.319 --> 05:34.317
That's okay.
I started taking

05:34.318 --> 05:36.285
Lord Tubbington's pills
for feline depression.

05:36.286 --> 05:40.234
Brittany, I-I think you and Emma
should meet daily for a while.

05:40.235 --> 05:42.263
I think you've
underestimated the impact

05:42.264 --> 05:44.306
- being held back has had on you.
- Well, thanks,

05:44.309 --> 05:46.317
But I don't really
have any time.

05:46.318 --> 05:48.275
After school,
I'm hopping into bed,

05:48.276 --> 05:49.325
eating cashews and bacon,

05:49.326 --> 05:51.277
and then watching
<i>The Client List </i> marathon.

05:53.239 --> 05:55.255
And with that, I said good-bye,

05:55.256 --> 05:56.306
and swooped out the doorway,

05:56.307 --> 05:59.268
my voice-over continuing
down the hallway.

06:00.293 --> 06:02.296
Okay, what was that?

06:02.297 --> 06:04.317
You know, everything's
been taken away from her.

06:04.318 --> 06:07.292
She doesn't have
anything to hold onto.

06:07.293 --> 06:10.326
Clearly, she's lost
her identity.

06:10.327 --> 06:11.327
We need to bring Brittany back.

06:11.328 --> 06:13.251
<i>Great news, guys.</i>

06:13.252 --> 06:15.255
Principal Figgins has
asked us to perform

06:15.256 --> 06:18.038
at the annual back-to-school
pep rally this week.

06:18.039 --> 06:19.312
Now, I understand our
National Champion

06:19.313 --> 06:21.327
street cred has dropped a little
bit since school started,

06:21.328 --> 06:24.284
but this is our chance to
really wow them and get it back.

06:24.285 --> 06:27.243
- What are we gonna perform?
- Good question.

06:27.244 --> 06:29.262
We're a family in here,
and when one of our family

06:29.263 --> 06:30.306
is falling down, it's up to us

06:30.307 --> 06:32.306
to get together to
pick them back up.

06:36.323 --> 06:39.272
Oh, my God. Are we doing
Britney Week again?

06:39.273 --> 06:41.283
You really came into your own
during the last Britney Week.

06:41.284 --> 06:43.233
You showed us
the best of Britney.

06:43.234 --> 06:44.306
Youth, energy, confidence.

06:44.307 --> 06:46.776
She inspires you,
and you inspire us.

06:46.777 --> 06:48.323
So everyone prepare
a Britney song for the week,

06:48.324 --> 06:51.276
and we're gonna pick one
to do for the pep rally.

06:51.277 --> 06:53.264
And I've asked Blaine and Artie
to give us a little taste

06:53.265 --> 06:55.259
of what we're looking for.

06:55.260 --> 06:56.314

the awesomeness of Britney.

08:41.260 --> 08:43.241
Thanks, Mr. Shue.

08:43.243 --> 08:45.234
This place is enormous!

08:45.235 --> 08:46.442
God, for 1,800 bucks a month,

08:46.443 --> 08:47.827
we could get a shoebox
in Manhattan

08:47.828 --> 08:48.922
or this hangar in Bushwick.

08:49.323 --> 08:51.291
Yeah, but what's the crime rate
like in this neighborhood?

08:51.292 --> 08:52.327
It looks a little shady.

08:52.328 --> 08:55.038
Ah, it's better than
Detroit and Damascus.

08:55.039 --> 08:56.310
So what do you think?
Should we take it?

08:56.311 --> 08:57.322
Are you crazy?

08:57.323 --> 08:59.281
Living here with you
instead of those dorms?

08:59.282 --> 09:00.289
It's heaven!

09:03.310 --> 09:05.309
Oh, New York Domino's
is so much better

09:05.310 --> 09:06.316
than Lima Domino's.

09:06.317 --> 09:07.318
It's the water.

09:08.323 --> 09:11.242
So have you heard
from Finn at all?

09:11.243 --> 09:13.235
Not since you asked me
yesterday.

09:14.302 --> 09:16.234
He's just giving you
your space.

09:16.235 --> 09:18.318
- I know.
- You want to feel nostalgic?

09:18.321 --> 09:20.318
- Mmm.
- Blaine said they're doing

09:20.319 --> 09:21.425
Britney Spears again
in Glee Club.

09:21.426 --> 09:23.308
Oh, my God. It feels like
such a long time ago

09:23.309 --> 09:24.427
since we've been
in the choir room.

09:24.428 --> 09:27.259
We are living
in the future, Rachel.

09:27.260 --> 09:30.256
- Speaking of which, my plan.
- Okay.

09:30.257 --> 09:31.831
I'm gonna re-audition for
second semester in NYADA.

09:31.832 --> 09:33.239
- Good.
- In the meantime,

09:33.240 --> 09:34.233
I've applied for a job

09:34.234 --> 09:35.723
at the only place I feel
will truly appreciate

09:35.724 --> 09:39.246
my sense of style and
Vogue.com.

09:39.247 --> 09:41.235
- Perfect.
- I know it sounds crazy,

09:41.236 --> 09:43.287
But in a way I'm almost glad
I didn't make it my first try.

09:43.288 --> 09:45.241
You know, I've really
learned a lot

09:45.242 --> 09:46.327
about myself over
the last couple months.

09:46.328 --> 09:50.280
I feel like I have a-a newfound
resilience and focus.

09:50.281 --> 09:52.268
I could really use some of that right now.
My dance teacher,

09:52.269 --> 09:54.267
she just won't let up on me.

09:54.268 --> 09:56.276
The other day, she told me
I wasn't sexy enough.

09:56.277 --> 09:58.331
Maybe you shouldn't wear
a bra to your next class.

09:58.332 --> 10:01.267
And take all of the attention
away from the Ms. Cassie July?

10:01.268 --> 10:03.242
She'd flip.

10:03.243 --> 10:04.245
I can't stand her.

10:04.246 --> 10:05.356
Cassie July is
your dance teacher?

10:05.357 --> 10:07.242
As in, <i>the </i> Cassie July,

10:07.243 --> 10:08.295
aka Crazy July,

10:08.296 --> 10:10.318
aka the biggest train wreck
in Broadway history?

10:10.319 --> 10:12.302
- What?
- You don't know her story?

10:12.303 --> 10:14.318
<i>Cassie July was the "It" girl
ten years ago.</i>

10:14.319 --> 10:17.259
<i>She scored the coveted role
of temptress Lola</i>

10:17.260 --> 10:19.760
in a high-profile revival
of <i>Damn Yankees.</i>

10:20.318 --> 10:22.289
Then, during the first preview
of the out-of-town tryout,

10:22.290 --> 10:24.310
Stop... stop. Stop the music!

10:26.235 --> 10:28.280
Whose cell phone is that?

10:28.281 --> 10:30.322
I'm not going on until
this rude person leaves.

10:30.323 --> 10:33.310
This performance is over
until you leave!

10:34.327 --> 10:36.246
All right.

10:36.247 --> 10:38.239
Come here, old man.

10:39.297 --> 10:42.276
You want it?
You want your phone?

10:42.277 --> 10:43.317
Yeah!

10:43.318 --> 10:46.276
No wonder she's always
just so angry.

10:46.277 --> 10:48.288
You can't give in to her.
Not ever.

10:48.289 --> 10:49.331
You have to keep fighting.

10:49.332 --> 10:52.323
If she wants sexy,
give her sexy.

10:54.000 --> 11:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:02.273 --> 11:04.263
So, here's the deal.

11:04.264 --> 11:05.289
We're both new girls here,

11:05.290 --> 11:07.289
- and new girls need to stick together.
- Cool.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.238
Boys.

11:09.239 --> 11:10.254
Who've you got your eye on?

11:10.255 --> 11:11.285
Jake's kind of cute.

11:11.286 --> 11:13.255
Oh, honey, no. Bad seed.

11:13.256 --> 11:15.255
Come on. He's an artist.

11:15.256 --> 11:16.304
You mean pick-up artist.

11:16.305 --> 11:18.266
Marley, everywhere you go
in this school,

11:18.267 --> 11:19.295
you see wreckage
of girls' hearts

11:19.296 --> 11:20.423
who thought
the same thing as you.

11:20.424 --> 11:23.267
And he's only been
in this school for two weeks!

11:23.268 --> 11:25.264
He's even been known
to troll the girls' gym class.

11:25.265 --> 11:26.326
Uh-uh.

11:26.327 --> 11:29.327

14:00.268 --> 14:01.302
- Hey!

14:01.305 --> 14:04.259
200,000.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.259
Hey, I miss seeing you in
the showers.

14:06.260 --> 14:08.280
I kind of need
to ask you a favor.

14:08.281 --> 14:09.267
Okay.

14:09.268 --> 14:14.276
So, Cassie said that I,
uh, wasn't sexy.

14:14.277 --> 14:15.289
You're crazy sexy.

14:15.290 --> 14:17.276
No, I'm not,

14:17.277 --> 14:20.296
but I'd really love it
if you would dance with me.

14:20.297 --> 14:23.288
'Cause there aren't enough,
you know, guys in my class.

14:23.289 --> 14:25.305
Cassie doesn't allow
upperclassmen

14:25.306 --> 14:27.277
to perform in her class.
She would have a fit.

14:27.278 --> 14:29.301
Got it.
Got it. Sorry.

Brittany, what are you doing?!

16:30.985 --> 16:32.287
Coach Sylvester's taken away
my high pony.

16:32.288 --> 16:33.304
If I can't have my

16:33.305 --> 16:35.297
high pony,
I don't want any hair at all.

16:35.298 --> 16:36.234
No!

16:36.235 --> 16:38.296
Brittany S. Pierce,

16:38.297 --> 16:40.310
what do you say to reports
you've gone off the rails?

16:40.311 --> 16:42.322
Leave me alone, JBI!

16:42.323 --> 16:44.304
What's going on in
your head right now?

16:44.305 --> 16:45.295
Leave me alone, JBI!

16:45.296 --> 16:46.310
What are you thinking?

16:46.311 --> 16:48.851
There's no comment!

16:48.852 --> 16:49.329
Leave me alone!

16:49.330 --> 16:50.323
I'm getting this.

16:53.306 --> 16:55.292
Should we do something?

16:55.293 --> 16:58.242
No, he deserves it.

16:58.243 --> 16:59.323
About Brittany's
downward spiral,

16:59.324 --> 17:03.305
I think the whole singing-at-her
thing isn't really helping.

17:03.306 --> 17:05.041
Probably what she misses most

17:05.042 --> 17:06.330
about Cheerios!
Is being in the spotlight.

17:06.332 --> 17:08.310
We should give her that.

17:10.285 --> 17:12.310
- Leave her alone!
- Leave Brittany alone!

17:14.289 --> 17:17.288
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
No scootering in the hallway.

17:17.289 --> 17:20.329
And Mr. McCarthy's physiology
class is the other direction.

17:20.330 --> 17:23.288
I'm protesting that class
on religious grounds.

17:23.289 --> 17:26.288
They make you dissect a pig,
and I'm kosher.

17:26.289 --> 17:28.288
What about English
and algebra and gym?

17:28.289 --> 17:29.300
I looked at your file.

17:29.301 --> 17:31.258
Seems like you're
not attending them, either.

17:31.259 --> 17:32.241
Why are you on my back?

17:32.242 --> 17:33.295
I'm not one of your students.

17:33.296 --> 17:34.310
I'm not in Glee Club.

17:34.311 --> 17:36.292
And that was my mistake.

17:36.293 --> 17:38.289
No, thanks.
I'm not looking to change.

17:38.290 --> 17:41.309
Your brother was a train
wreck, worse than you.

17:41.310 --> 17:44.330
But even at his worst,
he had a community.

17:44.331 --> 17:46.306
He had friends.

17:48.310 --> 17:50.239
I don't need friends.

17:54.273 --> 17:56.281
- I almost didn't come.
- The other girls told me

17:56.282 --> 17:58.251
I was crazy for even bothering.

17:58.252 --> 17:59.300
You really think they're right?

17:59.301 --> 18:01.291
I think you're a guy
who got hurt.

18:01.292 --> 18:03.314
And I think the hair and
the guitar and the jacket

18:03.315 --> 18:05.276
are all walls for that.

18:05.277 --> 18:06.331
You think too much.

18:06.332 --> 18:09.255
At all my other schools,
I was picked on.

18:09.256 --> 18:12.292
I tried so hard to be what I
thought they wanted me to be.

18:12.293 --> 18:14.251
Just made it worse.

18:14.252 --> 18:16.259
For the first time
at this school,

18:16.260 --> 18:21.238
I feel like I can just... be.

18:21.239 --> 18:22.308
Glee Club is so lame.

18:22.309 --> 18:24.297
What does Shyster have you guys
singing?

18:24.298 --> 18:27.251
It's Britney Spears week.

18:27.252 --> 18:31.055
Yeah, see, I prefer music
that uses actual instruments.

18:31.056 --> 18:32.295
Well, you haven't heard
my version yet.

18:32.296 --> 18:33.297
What song is it?

18:34.331 --> 18:36.327
I know I do.

18:43.310 --> 18:49.234
♪ Baby, I'm so into you ♪

18:49.235 --> 18:52.326

20:58.024 --> 20:59.961
You okay?

20:59.962 --> 21:02.019
Yeah, just got cold up here.

21:02.020 --> 21:03.983
Here.

21:29.008 --> 21:31.957
Kiki, why is everybody in the
glee club staring at me?

21:31.958 --> 21:33.020
Because those fools are jealous.

21:33.021 --> 21:34.020
Who's Kiki?

21:34.021 --> 21:36.969
Kiki is Siri's super smart
older cousin

21:36.970 --> 21:39.035
who's really jealous
of how famous Siri's gotten.

21:39.036 --> 21:40.972
She lives inside
this super cheap phone

21:40.973 --> 21:42.012
I found at the Laundromat.

21:42.013 --> 21:44.961
What size coffee is that?

21:44.962 --> 21:46.137
Kiki, what size coffee
am I drinking?

21:46.138 --> 21:49.011
You're drinking a settanta;
70 ounces of espresso.

21:49.012 --> 21:51.011
Thank you, Kiki.
You're the only one

21:51.012 --> 21:53.961
that I can trust now that
Santana's too busy for me.

21:53.962 --> 21:55.085
Brittany,
we're worried about you.

21:55.086 --> 21:56.960
We know how hard
it must have felt

21:56.961 --> 21:57.972
to get kicked off the Cheerios!

21:57.973 --> 21:59.951
We want to help you
get back on your feet

21:59.952 --> 22:00.972
and start performing again.

22:00.973 --> 22:01.970
You should be
the lead performer

22:01.971 --> 22:03.961
at the pep assembly on Friday.

22:03.962 --> 22:05.324
That's great,
but there's only one problem.

22:05.325 --> 22:06.969
I have to lip-sync.

22:06.970 --> 22:07.981
We don't lip-sync in Glee.

22:07.982 --> 22:09.964
Well, my voice is
too weak to sing live.

22:09.965 --> 22:12.037
I've been up every night this
week yelling at the shrubs

22:12.038 --> 22:14.969
in my yard that have been
making fun of me.

22:14.970 --> 22:16.024
This sounds
like a terrible idea.

22:16.025 --> 22:17.986
We'll record
the song in advance.

22:17.987 --> 22:19.962
I'll choreograph an
amazing routine without having

22:19.963 --> 22:21.998
to worry about anybody
running out of breath,

22:21.999 --> 22:23.974
and Mr. Schuester will
never know the difference.

22:23.975 --> 22:25.994
Lots of performers do this now.

22:25.995 --> 22:28.948
Kristen Stewart,
James Earl Jones.

22:28.949 --> 22:30.957
Kiki,

22:30.958 --> 22:32.995
is it a good idea for me
to lip-sync at the pep assembly?

22:32.996 --> 22:35.952
It's not a good idea.

22:35.953 --> 22:36.966
It's a great idea.

22:36.967 --> 22:38.958
Can I get you another settanta?

22:41.983 --> 22:43.002
You're late.

22:43.003 --> 22:45.978
And dressed like
a Walgreen's underwear model.

22:45.979 --> 22:47.994
What are you doing here, Brody?

22:47.995 --> 22:50.008
I asked Brody to come in and
help me with a little routine.

22:50.009 --> 22:52.028
And you just love
helping people, don't you?

22:52.029 --> 22:53.969
Especially the ingénues.

22:53.970 --> 22:56.027
And the reason why I'm
dressed all Bob Fosse-chic

22:56.028 --> 22:57.985
is because I wanted
to show you that

22:57.986 --> 22:59.941
I do have what it
takes to be sexy.

22:59.942 --> 23:01.973
Sexy enough to play
Evita, Roxie and Charity.

23:01.974 --> 23:03.948
Show me what you've prepared.

23:03.949 --> 23:06.948
Some of the dancers are
gonna help out, as well.

23:06.949 --> 23:09.008

So what do you think,
Ms. July?

25:24.000 --> 25:27.952
Am I ready to learn the tango?

25:27.953 --> 25:29.943
Look, you can memorize
a routine; so what?

25:29.944 --> 25:30.983
Rachel was incredible.

25:30.984 --> 25:33.011
<i>You </i> were incredible;
She was okay.

25:33.012 --> 25:34.961
And that song? Garbage.

25:34.962 --> 25:35.960
Whose idea was that?

25:35.961 --> 25:37.020
You want truth? Fine.

25:37.021 --> 25:40.032
Maria von Trapp,
Willy Loman, Shrek.

25:40.033 --> 25:41.956
Those are the roles
that are appropriate

25:41.957 --> 25:42.956
for your level of sex appeal.

25:42.957 --> 25:44.012
You're just jealous of me.

25:44.013 --> 25:45.944
Of all of us.

25:45.945 --> 25:47.133
- Rachel, don't.
- No, because we have

25:47.134 --> 25:49.010
Our entire careers ahead
of us and yours ended

25:49.011 --> 25:50.001
before it even began.

25:50.002 --> 25:51.029
We're the future,

25:51.030 --> 25:53.953
and you're just
some YouTube joke.

25:55.953 --> 25:57.965
You're done.

25:57.966 --> 26:00.032
Get out of my class.
Get out of my class!

26:00.033 --> 26:01.974
Out!

26:08.970 --> 26:10.965
Is that all I get, Jumbo?

26:10.966 --> 26:12.998
Why so stingy?

26:12.999 --> 26:14.970
They must let you eat
all those leftovers, huh?

26:14.971 --> 26:16.940
Quit it.
That's my mom.

26:16.941 --> 26:18.029
Whoa! You came out of that?

26:18.030 --> 26:19.961
Were you an only child

26:19.962 --> 26:22.011
or do you have a twin
who's still in there?

26:22.012 --> 26:23.991
Dude, imagine the
size of her dumps.

26:23.992 --> 26:25.007
Enough.

26:25.008 --> 26:27.941
Say you're sorry,
to both of them.

26:29.941 --> 26:31.965
You know what?

26:31.966 --> 26:33.949
Screw it.

26:37.966 --> 26:39.973
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Come on, tough guy!

26:39.974 --> 26:41.957
You're coming with me.

26:41.958 --> 26:43.952
In.

26:43.953 --> 26:44.989
This is garbage.

26:44.990 --> 26:47.010
Those guys suck and I'm the one
being dragged to see Figgins?

26:47.011 --> 26:48.970
I'm not taking you
to see Figgins.

26:48.971 --> 26:51.007
He's taking you to see me.

26:51.008 --> 26:53.019
Jake Puckerman,
I'd like to introduce you

26:53.020 --> 26:54.940
to your brother, Noah.

26:54.941 --> 26:55.970
I'll leave you two alone.

26:59.953 --> 27:01.961
You look more like Dad
than I do.

27:01.962 --> 27:03.956
He never told me about you
when I was a kid,

27:03.957 --> 27:05.029
but I do remember
my mom and dad

27:05.030 --> 27:07.965
arguing about a baby
and some slut waitress.

27:07.966 --> 27:09.029
That would be my mom.

27:11.016 --> 27:13.029
Schuester called you to
come and straighten me out.

27:13.030 --> 27:15.969
You're wasting your
time; I'm fine.

27:15.970 --> 27:17.982
And you are not my brother.

27:17.983 --> 27:19.012
You think you're a badass?

27:19.013 --> 27:20.765
Nailing a bunch of chicks,

27:20.766 --> 27:22.031
beating up some punks
in the cafeteria?

27:22.032 --> 27:23.031
I'm the original badass.

27:23.032 --> 27:24.956
I had my first threesome
at seven,

27:24.957 --> 27:26.027
and once, I beat up
a police horse.

27:26.028 --> 27:27.989
So what, are you
gonna kick my ass

27:27.990 --> 27:29.020
if I don't get myself together?

27:29.021 --> 27:31.948
I know what it feels like
to be scared

27:31.949 --> 27:35.028
that you're not important
or smart or worth anything.

27:35.029 --> 27:36.990
We had the same dad, bro.

27:36.991 --> 27:39.010
I know what it feels like to
spend all day trying to prove

27:39.011 --> 27:40.022
something to someone who's never

27:40.023 --> 27:42.012
going to give
two craps about you.

27:42.013 --> 27:45.948
I rode my motorcycle,
I played my axe,

27:45.949 --> 27:48.032
I banged every chick
in this place twice,

27:48.033 --> 27:50.032
and you know what,
none of it made me a man.

27:50.033 --> 27:52.024
What made me a man
was sitting here in this room,

27:52.025 --> 27:53.978
singing songs I hated next to

27:53.979 --> 27:55.947
the biggest collection of losers
you've ever seen.

27:55.948 --> 27:57.014
Them and Mr. Shue
made me a man.

27:57.015 --> 27:59.029
And if you come in here,
it'll make you one, too.

27:59.030 --> 28:02.036
Think about it
for a couple days.

28:02.037 --> 28:04.990
I got to get back to L.A.

28:04.991 --> 28:06.035
I got a date with the chick

28:06.036 --> 28:08.029
who was third runner-up
on <i>The Bachelor.</i>

28:08.030 --> 28:09.944
One thing.

28:09.945 --> 28:12.953
Whether you join Glee Club
or not, you're my brother.

28:24.008 --> 28:25.037
Quiet, please, children.

28:26.974 --> 28:29.028
Shh.

28:29.029 --> 28:33.998
Welcome, children, to McKinley
High's annual fall assembly,

28:33.999 --> 28:38.015
where we gather
to celebrate teen pep.

28:38.016 --> 28:40.978
Before we begin,
a few announcements.

28:40.979 --> 28:45.019
First and foremost,
I wish to address the rumor

28:45.020 --> 28:48.007
that I like to be milked
like a cow

28:48.008 --> 28:52.973
because my breasts are filled
with delicious, wholesome milk.

28:52.974 --> 28:54.994
That rumor is untrue.

28:54.995 --> 28:58.944
And now, without further ado,
it's time for a performance

28:58.945 --> 29:00.973
of music to be enjoyed by all.

29:00.974 --> 29:03.965
Brittany, shouldn't you
be stretching or warming up

29:03.966 --> 29:04.994
or something?

29:04.995 --> 29:06.006
Do you need a baby wipe?

29:06.007 --> 29:07.233
You have Cheeto hands
and Cheeto mouth.

29:07.234 --> 29:08.966
I'm fine, thank you.

29:09.995 --> 29:11.023
It is my honor

29:11.024 --> 29:13.033
to introduce McKinley High's
New Directions!

30:45.020 --> 30:46.965
In the 58-year history

30:46.966 --> 30:48.437
of the William McKinley
High School Glee Club,

30:48.438 --> 30:51.952
there has never been
such a debacle!

30:51.953 --> 30:54.952
We do not lip-sync ever!

30:54.953 --> 30:55.960
We're sorry, Mr. Shue.

30:55.961 --> 30:57.306
We were just trying
to help Brittany out...

30:57.307 --> 30:58.322
Lip-syncing is the equivalent of

30:58.323 --> 30:59.960
blood doping
in professional sports!

30:59.961 --> 31:01.939
Every gain we've made
in the last three years

31:01.940 --> 31:03.003
has been wiped out.

31:03.004 --> 31:05.994
And I'm not just talking about
our reputation here at McKinley.

31:05.995 --> 31:08.948
If the National Show Choir Board
of Review gets wind of this,

31:08.949 --> 31:11.002
we could be barred
from competing.

31:11.003 --> 31:13.973
What do you have to say
for yourself, Brittany?

31:13.974 --> 31:15.033
To quote the legend herself,

31:15.034 --> 31:17.952
"If I met me,
I would say a quick hello

31:17.953 --> 31:19.941
and then think
I was a really nice girl."

31:20.941 --> 31:22.001
And I resign from Glee Club,

31:22.002 --> 31:23.020
effective immediately.

31:36.003 --> 31:38.969
I'm working.

31:38.970 --> 31:40.939
I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry.

31:40.940 --> 31:43.033
All those things that I said to
you, they were completely wrong

31:43.034 --> 31:44.994
and-and out of line.

31:44.995 --> 31:47.003
I felt like you were
picking on me for no reason.

31:47.004 --> 31:50.998
Stop... talking.

31:50.999 --> 31:54.007
Look...

31:54.008 --> 31:58.944
you lost it and you lashed out,
same as I did ten years ago.

31:58.945 --> 32:00.965
Except, all it took
for you to snap

32:00.966 --> 32:04.994
was a little honest feedback
in... excuse me... dance class.

32:04.995 --> 32:06.233
And you expect
to make it on Broadway?

32:06.234 --> 32:11.994
Where all there is
is scrutiny and judgment?

32:11.995 --> 32:13.953
- I'm really sorry...
- And what if someone taped

32:13.956 --> 32:16.949
Your little outburst and then
posted it on the Internet?

32:17.991 --> 32:20.028
You'd never get cast.

32:20.029 --> 32:21.998
You have one chance.

32:21.999 --> 32:25.028
You screw it up, you're done.

32:25.029 --> 32:27.952
You're that crazy actress.

32:27.953 --> 32:30.994
And why would anybody
want to work with you?

32:30.995 --> 32:32.952
Because you're good.

32:32.953 --> 32:34.974
I was great.

32:36.987 --> 32:38.990
But it doesn't
make a difference,

32:38.991 --> 32:42.994
because I wasn't ready
for the pressure.

32:42.995 --> 32:45.973
Believe me, it's a whole lot
more vicious out there

32:45.974 --> 32:46.974
than it is in here.

32:46.975 --> 32:49.002
That's why I pick
on my students.

32:49.003 --> 32:50.991
I want them to be ready.

32:53.991 --> 32:56.994
Well, I-I know
that I'm not there yet.

32:56.995 --> 32:58.994
Not even close.

32:58.995 --> 33:00.957
And if I had my choice,

33:00.958 --> 33:02.961
I wouldn't let you
back in my class.

33:02.962 --> 33:05.002
I don't believe
in second chances.

33:05.003 --> 33:06.969
I know they don't exist.

33:06.970 --> 33:08.969
Unfortunately for me,

33:08.970 --> 33:11.999
school policy says
you get a warning.

33:15.991 --> 33:17.015
So...

33:17.016 --> 33:20.940
So you're in, and on probation
and dance belt duty.

33:20.941 --> 33:23.019
Hand-washed, all of them.

33:23.020 --> 33:25.998
You're dismissed, Schwimmer.

33:25.999 --> 33:29.987
Don't forget the hamper
on your way out.

33:42.008 --> 33:45.999
Four, five, six, seven...

33:47.029 --> 33:48.972
I got your note
to come meet you here.

33:48.973 --> 33:49.981
Thanks for drawing the map.

33:49.982 --> 33:51.135
Yeah, I always keep it
in my pocket

33:51.136 --> 33:52.970
in case someone
steals my compass.

33:54.991 --> 33:57.982
Look, I know what you're up to.

33:57.983 --> 34:00.986
The lip-syncing, beating up
Jacob Ben Israel.

34:00.987 --> 34:02.958
You're intentionally
hitting rock bottom.

34:02.959 --> 34:04.956
So I can make
a glorious comeback,

34:04.957 --> 34:05.977
just like Britney.

34:05.978 --> 34:06.989
I mean, look at her.

34:06.990 --> 34:09.003
She got paid $14 million
to be on <i>X Factor.</i>

34:09.004 --> 34:11.007
She looks great.

34:11.007 --> 34:13.969
She has an amazing perfume
you can smell from miles away.

34:13.969 --> 34:16.989
No matter what happened to her,
she just came back stronger.

34:16.991 --> 34:19.014
Right. Consider
this the last stop

34:19.016 --> 34:22.027
on the <i>Train Wreck Express...
</i> an intervention.

34:22.029 --> 34:24.023
Thank you.

34:24.024 --> 34:26.956
I'm so ready to come back.

34:26.958 --> 34:28.978
I'm just so sad
that everybody's so mad at me.

34:28.978 --> 34:31.029
I just think they didn't
understand what you were up to.

34:31.030 --> 34:33.989
Yeah.

34:33.991 --> 34:35.994
But you did.

34:35.995 --> 34:37.998
I think we just think the same.

34:37.998 --> 34:39.987
Yeah, it's probably
because we're both blonde.

34:39.987 --> 34:41.023
You okay?

34:41.024 --> 34:42.989
You still seem kind of bummed.

34:42.991 --> 34:44.014
I don't know.

34:44.016 --> 34:46.002
Santana would have understood.

34:46.003 --> 34:47.964
And then she would have
used mean words

34:47.965 --> 34:49.005
against anyone
who got down on me.

34:49.007 --> 34:50.014
You miss her, huh?

34:50.014 --> 34:51.991
I just miss, like,
the little things,

34:51.992 --> 34:54.007
like her laugh and the smell
of her armpits.

34:54.007 --> 34:55.940
Yes, we had
interesting lady sex,

34:55.940 --> 34:57.961
but she was also my best friend.

34:57.962 --> 35:00.003
Well, now you have a new
friend, and he's blond.

35:01.987 --> 35:03.953
I'm talking about me.

35:04.966 --> 35:05.993
Now you just got to figure out

35:05.994 --> 35:07.991
a way to get back
on the Cheerios!

35:07.992 --> 35:10.033
It's all part of the comeback.

35:15.024 --> 35:17.948
I am here to inform you
of your legal requirement

35:17.949 --> 35:20.003
to restore my high pony
and put me back on the Cheerios!

35:21.987 --> 35:23.957
I beg your pardon?

35:23.958 --> 35:25.601
I studied the McKinley High
Student Council Charter,

35:25.602 --> 35:26.979
and it says that
the senior class president

35:26.980 --> 35:29.007
continues his term
until he or she graduates,

35:29.008 --> 35:30.957
which... I never graduated,

35:30.958 --> 35:32.949
so, technically,
I'm still president.

35:33.958 --> 35:36.007
I drafted an executive order
demanding

35:36.008 --> 35:37.991
that Brittany S. Pierce
be reinstated

35:37.992 --> 35:40.978
as a member in good standing
of the McKinley High Cheerios!

35:40.979 --> 35:43.016
Brittany, take a seat.

35:46.999 --> 35:49.028
This is clearly
the plan of an idiot.

35:49.029 --> 35:51.007
But a plan nonetheless,

35:51.008 --> 35:53.998
and one that required the
barest modicum of human logic

35:53.999 --> 35:55.991
which, frankly,
I thought was beyond you.

35:55.992 --> 35:58.023
If you want to be back
on the Cheerios!,

35:58.024 --> 36:00.965
I want you to graduate
by the end of the year.

36:00.966 --> 36:02.343
And that means you're
going to have to turn

36:02.344 --> 36:03.999
- those grades around.
- I'm already working on that.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.010
Mr. Schuester
eventually realized

36:05.011 --> 36:06.985
that my lip-syncing
was a cry for help

36:06.986 --> 36:08.943
and wanted to step up
and take action.

36:08.944 --> 36:10.016
He and Miss Pillsbury
are spending

36:10.017 --> 36:12.941
one afternoon a week
tutoring me.

36:13.033 --> 36:14.036
Barack Obama.

36:14.037 --> 36:15.965
Yes.

36:15.966 --> 36:16.990
Glenn Close.

36:16.991 --> 36:18.965
Oh, good effort, Britt.

36:18.966 --> 36:19.994
Baby steps.

36:19.995 --> 36:22.023
I got a C-minus
on my U.S. History exam,

36:22.024 --> 36:25.007
which the teacher bumped up
two whole letter grades

36:25.008 --> 36:26.999
because I wrote in English
instead of my secret language

36:27.000 --> 36:28.953
I invented in middle school.

36:30.945 --> 36:33.008
Brittany, welcome back.

36:34.003 --> 36:36.966
<i>Meep-zorp flurm-gloob.</i>

36:41.979 --> 36:43.037
What do you think?

36:43.038 --> 36:46.002
Am I being too obvious?

36:46.003 --> 36:47.999
He hasn't called you
because he loves you,

36:48.000 --> 36:50.944
not because he's
forgotten about you.

36:50.945 --> 36:52.958
Your freedom is a gift
he's given you... accept it.

36:52.959 --> 36:55.982
I know. It's just so much
freedom all at once

36:55.983 --> 36:58.952
that it's starting to feel
like severe loneliness.

36:58.953 --> 37:00.990
The only cure
to loneliness is cake.

37:00.991 --> 37:02.497
Cake.

37:02.498 --> 37:04.003
There's a great Italian
bakery down the street.

37:04.004 --> 37:05.122
You don't mind
going out at night?

37:05.123 --> 37:06.672
Oh, no, it's cool.
I guess if I just,

37:06.673 --> 37:08.006
you know, walk around
like a crazy person

37:08.007 --> 37:09.012
yelling at things and twitching,

37:09.013 --> 37:10.999
people will keep
their distance.

37:14.995 --> 37:16.018
Well, hello there, kind sir.

37:16.019 --> 37:17.020
Hey. Uh, I'm Brody.

37:17.021 --> 37:18.020
I'm Kurt.

37:19.983 --> 37:21.952
Hi.

37:21.953 --> 37:23.969
I was just going to go
get some cake.

37:23.970 --> 37:24.986
Uh...

37:24.987 --> 37:26.020
I'll leave you two alone.

37:30.020 --> 37:32.011
Wow.

37:32.012 --> 37:34.982
This is huge.

37:34.983 --> 37:37.944
Too bad it took me 45 minutes
on the train to get here.

37:37.945 --> 37:38.974
I've lived here
for three years,

37:38.975 --> 37:41.940
and I didn't even know
there was a "J" train.

37:41.941 --> 37:42.949
Wait, you took the train

37:42.950 --> 37:44.947
for 45 minutes just
to come and see me?

37:44.948 --> 37:47.029
Yep. Sandwiched between
some guy who said he was Jesus

37:47.030 --> 37:50.007
and two German tourists
who were very lost.

37:50.008 --> 37:53.036
But I came here
to give you this orchid.

37:53.037 --> 37:55.036
Apparently, it's good luck
in a new place.

37:55.037 --> 37:57.029
And they're kind of sexy...
for a plant.

37:57.030 --> 37:59.948
Thank you.

37:59.949 --> 38:01.961
Oh, and I, uh... I wanted
to tell you something

38:01.962 --> 38:04.965
that didn't feel
appropriate over text.

38:04.966 --> 38:06.023
What?

38:06.024 --> 38:09.990
That I... I really liked
dancing with you.

38:09.991 --> 38:12.015
And I think that you...

38:12.016 --> 38:14.945
I think that you're
really sexy.

38:15.991 --> 38:17.002
And...

38:17.003 --> 38:19.032
Oh...

38:19.033 --> 38:20.990
I can't.

38:20.991 --> 38:24.036
I think you are amazing
and-and-and...

38:24.037 --> 38:26.944
very, very, very sexy.

38:26.945 --> 38:27.990
I just...

38:27.991 --> 38:29.957
You're still in love

38:29.958 --> 38:31.952
with your boyfriend.

38:31.953 --> 38:34.965
Here's the thing... I...
I will respect your boundaries,

38:34.966 --> 38:38.952
but just know that
when we're together,

38:38.953 --> 38:40.953
whatever we're talking about,
whatever we're doing,

38:40.954 --> 38:42.958
I'm thinking of kissing you.

38:44.949 --> 38:46.962
Enjoy the orchid.

38:59.003 --> 39:01.990
Uh, you think I could sit
next to you in Glee Club?

39:01.991 --> 39:03.944
I don't know anybody else.

39:03.945 --> 39:04.991
So you're going to join?

39:04.992 --> 39:08.965
I didn't realize I had that
powerful of an effect on you.

39:08.966 --> 39:09.990
It wasn't you.

39:09.991 --> 39:11.944
Well, it-it helped.

39:11.945 --> 39:13.952
I just...
I don't know.

39:13.953 --> 39:15.961
I get these feelings sometimes
to punch someone

39:15.962 --> 39:17.958
or steal a cop car
or kiss someone,

39:17.959 --> 39:20.990
and I hear Glee Club
might help them go away.

39:20.991 --> 39:23.011
Even though it
totally sucks balls.

39:23.012 --> 39:26.023
I promise, it's not that bad.

39:26.024 --> 39:29.033
Just stick with me, and I'll
help you get through it.

39:33.953 --> 39:36.007
It's nice to have
a friend looking out for me.

39:36.008 --> 39:38.948
Well, I owe you for
what you did for my mom.

39:38.949 --> 39:43.023
Oh, I just realized I'm
still wearing your jacket.

39:43.024 --> 39:44.952
Looks pretty good on you.

39:44.953 --> 39:45.968
I bet it looks better on me.

39:45.969 --> 39:47.033
We're dating now.

39:47.034 --> 39:49.970
Didn't Jake tell you?

39:50.991 --> 39:52.953
No, he didn't.

39:53.970 --> 39:55.947
Well, uh, it's not
really my style

39:55.948 --> 39:57.003
to put a label on things.

39:57.004 --> 39:58.962
You two make a great couple.

40:02.949 --> 40:04.983
Bye.

40:26.991 --> 40:29.019
All right.
Okay, let's give

40:29.020 --> 40:32.007
a big New Directions!
Welcome to Jake Puckerman.

40:32.008 --> 40:33.985
Hey, dude. Uh, me and your bro
were practically best friends.

40:33.986 --> 40:35.991
Is it weird that I know him
a lot better than you?

40:35.992 --> 40:37.023
Welcome, bro.

40:37.024 --> 40:39.953
God made you, and God
doesn't make mistakes.

40:54.970 --> 40:57.003
- Mr. Schuester.
- Yeah, Marley.

40:57.006 --> 40:59.998
If it's all right, I'd like
to sing one last Britney song.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.647
Did that come out this morning?
'Cause we've

41:01.648 --> 41:02.949
scraped the bottom
of that Britney barrel.

41:02.950 --> 41:03.986
Not exactly.
