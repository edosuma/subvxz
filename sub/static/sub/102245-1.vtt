for some entitled millennial

10:02.333 --> 10:04.250
who I'd keep here until 10:00 every night.

10:04.333 --> 10:05.166
Every night.

10:05.250 --> 10:07.958
[interviewer] Who I could watch cry
while eating a gluten-free burrito

10:08.041 --> 10:10.666
and hashtags,
"Hurt feelings. This job is so unfair."

10:11.375 --> 10:13.083
I wouldn't want to do that to you.

10:13.166 --> 10:14.333
I like you too much.

10:14.916 --> 10:15.916
I like you too.

10:17.083 --> 10:18.375
[mellow music playing]

10:18.458 --> 10:19.500
[indistinct chatter]

10:20.875 --> 10:24.000
-[Carlos] I'm sorry about the job, honey.
-[Allison] Oh, it's fine.

10:24.083 --> 10:26.916
I don't know that I'm still passionate
about marketing anyway.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.375
Not enough to cry
into my gluten-free burrito.

10:29.458 --> 10:31.625
Hey. If I'm gonna go back to work,

10:31.708 --> 10:35.041
I need to make sure
our kids are okay without me first.

10:39.500 --> 10:40.458
Oh.

10:40.541 --> 10:42.291
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Torres.

10:42.375 --> 10:46.000
-[man] Please, take a seat.
-Thank you. We're getting two for one.

10:46.083 --> 10:47.916
-I guess we'll be home early.
-[chuckling]

10:48.000 --> 10:51.416
Is this about Nando's grades?
Because we are working on focus--

10:51.500 --> 10:55.666
Uh, it's not about Nando's grades,
although, uh, they're not great.

10:56.250 --> 10:57.666
Oh. Getting better.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.375
We wanted to meet with you together

10:59.458 --> 11:03.625
because, uh, we've noticed a common theme
in Katie and Nando's schoolwork.

11:04.208 --> 11:05.458
What's the common theme?

11:05.541 --> 11:08.666
Well, here's a haiku
Katie wrote in my English class.

11:09.375 --> 11:11.125
"A caged bird am I.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.291
My mother, my sweet captor.

11:15.291 --> 11:17.333
Mother, let me fly."

11:17.416 --> 11:18.708
"Mother, my sweet captor.

11:18.791 --> 11:21.875
-Mother, let me fly."
-Five, seven, five. She nailed it. Haiku.

11:21.958 --> 11:23.750
I didn't think much of it at first,

11:23.833 --> 11:27.750
until Mr. Chan told me about a video
that Nando made for his history class.

11:27.833 --> 11:30.125
He made a video? That's pretty cool.

11:30.208 --> 11:32.541
Let's just have a look at the video.

11:33.250 --> 11:34.083
[sighs]

11:35.458 --> 11:38.333
[Nando] The following program
is intended for mature audiences only.

11:38.416 --> 11:40.666
It contains violence,
adult language, and nudity.

11:40.750 --> 11:43.166
Viewer discretion is advised.

11:43.250 --> 11:44.958
Don't worry. There's no nudity.

11:45.041 --> 11:46.333
-Oh, okay.
-[scoffs]

11:46.416 --> 11:47.375
Phew.

11:47.458 --> 11:50.333
[Nando] Stalin, Mussolini,

11:50.416 --> 11:51.583
and Mom.

11:54.208 --> 11:56.583
My mother might not have
had anyone tortured or killed…

11:56.666 --> 11:57.875
Not yet.

11:57.958 --> 11:58.791
Oh.

11:58.875 --> 12:02.000
[Nando] …but in our house,
she's no less of a dictator.

12:02.083 --> 12:03.750
So now I'm a dictator.

12:03.833 --> 12:07.208
I'm not asking twice, Nando.
You will do what I say, when I say it.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.250
I'm your mother. I don't need a reason.

12:09.333 --> 12:10.833
I don't, so…

12:10.916 --> 12:13.625
[Nando] Her goal, maximum oppression.

12:13.708 --> 12:15.833
You're not going
till you finish your homework.

12:15.916 --> 12:17.416
I mean, that's parenting.

12:17.958 --> 12:18.875
[chuckles]

12:18.958 --> 12:22.500
Stop. It's like 1984 in this house.
Big Mother is always watching.

12:22.583 --> 12:24.083
I like that nickname. It's tough.

12:24.166 --> 12:26.375
Why can't Miss Hoffling
ever assign a happy book?

12:26.458 --> 12:30.500
[scoffs] Okay. They are depressing.
Have you ever read Little Women?

12:30.583 --> 12:32.041
She gets scarlet fever.

12:32.125 --> 12:34.083
-The Little Prince?
-[Hoffling] He has no family.

12:34.166 --> 12:37.125
Harry Potter's an orphan.
There are no happy books.

12:37.208 --> 12:38.916
Don't walk away from me.

12:39.000 --> 12:39.875
Ow!

12:40.833 --> 12:42.208
[roaring] Nando!

12:48.750 --> 12:50.333
[mellow music playing]

12:56.250 --> 12:57.708
[Carlos] Where are you going?

12:58.833 --> 13:02.125
Oh, come on, honey. You can make
anyone look bad with editing.

13:02.208 --> 13:04.458
-You make me look bad.
-Me? Why me?

13:04.541 --> 13:07.000
Because you get to be
the fun dad everybody loves,

13:07.083 --> 13:08.583
and I am stuck being the bad cop.

13:08.666 --> 13:11.375
You didn't see the dad
as the villain in that video, did you?

13:11.458 --> 13:15.958
It'll probably get uploaded to YouTube.
Then I'll just be the viral psycho mom.

13:16.041 --> 13:18.333
How'd you get to be the fun one?
I was the fun one.

13:18.416 --> 13:22.166
Look, Ally,
I am the bad guy all day at work.

13:22.250 --> 13:25.458
Every time I walk into that office,
people stop laughing and leave the room,

13:25.541 --> 13:30.458
but when I come home, the kids,
they actually smile when they see me.

13:31.208 --> 13:33.000
Yeah. Well, it's not fair.

13:33.083 --> 13:36.666
I hear myself with the kids, and
I think I wouldn't even hang out with me.

13:36.750 --> 13:38.458
-[thudding]
-[screaming]

13:38.541 --> 13:40.083
I'm so sorry. I have a suggestion.

13:40.166 --> 13:44.375
Sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you.
I was just eavesdropping or spying.

13:44.458 --> 13:47.625
There are so many parents out there,
and I come in here to hide,

13:47.708 --> 13:51.083
and then I got really hungry,
so I made a huge thing of tots.

13:51.166 --> 13:53.375
[chuckles] Would you guys care for a tot?

13:53.458 --> 13:55.750
Do you want a tot? A hot tot?

13:55.833 --> 13:57.500
Come here. Have a hot tot.

13:58.375 --> 14:00.375
Have a tot. They're perfectly lukewarm.

14:00.458 --> 14:01.500
Who are you?

14:01.583 --> 14:04.750
It's Mr. Deacon.
Katie and Nando's guidance counselor.

14:04.833 --> 14:09.500
Yes, but thanks to budget cuts,
I'm also the PE teacher/football coach.

14:09.583 --> 14:13.333
Go, Cougars! Shoot the layup
for the touchdown. [scoffs]

14:13.416 --> 14:16.541
I don't know anything about sports.
No, I was a science major.

14:16.625 --> 14:20.458
I specialized in the gastrointestinal
behavior of field mice.

14:21.708 --> 14:25.500
But I do know
a thing or two about parenting,

14:25.583 --> 14:28.041
both professionally and personally.

14:28.125 --> 14:30.750
I have six beautiful kids at home.

14:30.833 --> 14:33.958
Timmy, Tommy, Tonya,
Tanya, Tyson, and Doug.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.875
How come you look like
you're just back from Tahiti?

14:36.958 --> 14:38.708
You want to know what my secret is?

14:39.791 --> 14:42.583
I give my kids Yes Days.

14:42.666 --> 14:45.041
Yes Days? What's a Yes Day?

14:45.125 --> 14:47.875
You pick a day
in the not-too-distant future,

14:47.958 --> 14:53.500
and for 24 hours, you say yes
to everything that your kids want.

14:54.083 --> 14:57.416
[laughing]

14:57.500 --> 14:58.875
-[Carlos] Really?
-Yeah.

14:58.958 --> 15:02.041
-Are you serious?
-What, you say yes to everything?

15:02.125 --> 15:03.791
Well, you set some ground rules.

15:03.875 --> 15:05.791
They can't ask for
something in the future,

15:05.875 --> 15:07.791
and they can't kill anybody, obvi.

15:07.875 --> 15:08.916
Hum.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.458
I know it sounds crazy,
but it is a true game changer.

15:12.541 --> 15:17.083
They liberate kids
and give them a rare sense of autonomy,

15:17.166 --> 15:19.625
and it sets the parents free too.

15:19.708 --> 15:22.791
Yeah, Mr. Coach Deacon,

15:22.875 --> 15:25.666
I would love to just
take a day off from being a mom

15:25.750 --> 15:27.666
and let my kids do whatever they want,

15:27.750 --> 15:31.333
but I'd also love to find
a rainbow unicorn and fly it to the moon.

15:31.958 --> 15:33.750
Then I think you'd want a pegasus.

15:33.833 --> 15:35.208
More of a pegacorn.

15:35.291 --> 15:36.833
[chuckles]

15:36.916 --> 15:40.083
The point is, you don't know our kids.

15:40.166 --> 15:41.666
Oh, these tots have turned.

15:41.750 --> 15:43.458
If we tried what you're proposing,

15:43.541 --> 15:46.125
it… it would be apocalyptic.

15:47.291 --> 15:51.166
You're right. I don't know your kids.
I don't know everything,

15:51.250 --> 15:52.083
but…

15:53.583 --> 15:54.666
I will say this.

15:55.583 --> 15:58.166
You should say yes to a Yes Day.

16:02.416 --> 16:04.500
Ooh! Meatloaf!

16:05.250 --> 16:08.166
"Kids who are given Yes Days
consume less sugar,"

16:08.250 --> 16:10.500
not really,
"and spend less time on the Internet."

16:10.583 --> 16:12.875
It doesn't make sense.
You're not falling for this?

16:12.958 --> 16:14.416
Everything happens for a reason.

16:14.500 --> 16:17.458
Maybe there's a reason
that guy showed up with those tater tots.

16:17.541 --> 16:21.458
Maybe by being a little less serious,
we can make things better.

16:21.541 --> 16:23.166
I mean, you said it yourself.

16:23.708 --> 16:27.375
We've been trying to do it the right way.
Maybe it's time to try something new.

16:28.583 --> 16:29.416
[sighs]

16:33.166 --> 16:35.458
So? Tired of hearing how great I am?

16:35.541 --> 16:38.333
You want to give
Steven Spielberg here a Yes Day?

16:38.416 --> 16:39.791
What's a Yes Day?

16:39.875 --> 16:41.500
This new thing where parents agree

16:41.583 --> 16:43.958
to say yes to everything
their kids ask for for 24 hours.

16:44.041 --> 16:46.291
-Radical!
-How am I just hearing about this?

16:46.375 --> 16:49.875
Well, don't get too excited.
Mom probably won't let us have one anyway.

16:50.625 --> 16:53.041
Well, what does that mean? Why wouldn't I?

16:53.125 --> 16:54.916
[Katie] Yes Days are, like, fun.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.708
And you're, like, a fun killer.

16:57.791 --> 17:00.791
-Oh.
-Come on, Katie, your mom is plenty fun.

17:00.875 --> 17:02.291
She is fun.

17:04.416 --> 17:05.500
[soft music playing]

17:05.583 --> 17:08.750
I have had a very long day,
and I'm gonna go to bed.

17:08.833 --> 17:10.625
-So, good night.
-[Carlos] No, we…

17:10.708 --> 17:11.791
We still need to…

17:11.875 --> 17:14.708
-[Allison] It's okay.
-Honey? Tell your mom she's fun.

17:15.958 --> 17:17.875
-Nando?
-You told us never to lie.

17:17.958 --> 17:18.791
Yeah, Daddy.

17:27.541 --> 17:30.541
[faint screaming]

17:31.958 --> 17:33.041
Hey, guys.

17:34.416 --> 17:35.416
[whispers] Hey.

17:36.166 --> 17:39.291
Of course you think your mom can't be fun.
You don't even know me.

17:39.375 --> 17:42.625
I invented fun. I… I used to be
the funnest person I knew.

17:43.291 --> 17:44.125
What happened?

17:44.208 --> 17:48.250
What happened was I had three babies
that had to be kept safe and alive.

17:48.333 --> 17:50.458
It was a lot of pressure,
but that's not the point.

17:50.541 --> 17:52.916
The point is, I can be fun again.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.375
Mom, really? There's no way.

17:56.666 --> 17:59.083
[clicks tongue] I'll have a Yes Day.

17:59.666 --> 18:01.875
We will have a super time.

18:02.500 --> 18:05.791
Just you watch and see.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.291
Mama can haiku too.

18:11.375 --> 18:15.208
Sorry, but you couldn't make it through
a Yes Morning, let alone a Yes Day.

18:16.041 --> 18:19.750
[clicks tongue] Would you like to have
a little wager on that?

18:20.750 --> 18:21.916
Know what? I'd love to.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.500
Hm. How about this?

18:23.583 --> 18:25.750
If you say no one time,

18:26.750 --> 18:29.708
I get to go to Fleekfest with Layla.
No adults, no parents.

18:29.791 --> 18:32.375
Just us young, underage, vulnerable girls.

18:32.458 --> 18:34.083
Wait, honey. Are you sure?

18:35.875 --> 18:37.291
I'll take your wager, missy,

18:37.375 --> 18:39.500
because I know that I won't say no.

18:39.583 --> 18:41.916
And when you lose, and you will lose,

18:42.000 --> 18:46.166
I am so fun that
you will still get to go to your concert.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.041
-Really?
-Absolutely.

18:48.125 --> 18:49.166
With me.

18:49.750 --> 18:52.375
I'll sit next to you,
and we'll hold hands.

18:52.458 --> 18:54.583
We'll put our hands in the air
like we just don't care.

18:57.500 --> 18:58.750
I want in on this.

18:59.250 --> 19:00.208
Me too.

19:00.291 --> 19:01.375
Let's do this.

19:01.458 --> 19:03.208
[all] Arriba!

19:04.083 --> 19:07.583
[Allison] There are ground rules, though.
The Yes Day has to be earned.

19:07.666 --> 19:08.916
Do your chores.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.583
Finish your homework.

19:10.666 --> 19:11.583
You can do better.

19:15.291 --> 19:19.250
[Allison] You can't ask to do anything
dangerous or illegal, obviously.

19:19.333 --> 19:23.333
-What are you guys up to over there?
-Don't worry. It's totally safe.

19:28.541 --> 19:30.083
[Allison] You'll each have a budget,

19:30.166 --> 19:33.750
and you can't ask to travel
more than 20 miles from home.

19:33.833 --> 19:38.333
So this rules out Magic Mountain,
Japan, and all space tourism.

19:38.416 --> 19:42.333
Will you have to say yes
to absolutely everything?

19:42.416 --> 19:44.208
Close, but there are some rules.

19:44.291 --> 19:45.458
Oh man!

19:48.125 --> 19:49.041
Yes, bud.

19:52.416 --> 19:54.708
[Allison]
But the last rule is the biggest,

19:54.791 --> 20:00.333
that this family has the most fun
we've ever had in our entire lives.

20:02.916 --> 20:05.833
Any second. Any second.
Any second. Any second. Any second.

20:05.916 --> 20:07.250
[alarm ringing]

20:07.333 --> 20:09.041
It's Yes Day!

20:09.916 --> 20:12.416
Everybody, wake up!

20:12.500 --> 20:13.500
All right.

20:13.583 --> 20:14.541
[knocking]

20:15.625 --> 20:16.500
[knocking]

20:18.125 --> 20:20.541
Come on, you sleepyheads. Get up! Come on.

20:20.625 --> 20:24.125
Nando, it's too early.
We have the whole day. Go back to bed.

20:24.208 --> 20:25.041
Mom?

20:25.125 --> 20:26.333
-Having regrets, Mom?
-Mom?

20:26.416 --> 20:28.416
[Katie] Look, she's so afraid,
she can't even move.

20:29.458 --> 20:30.291
[gasps]

20:30.375 --> 20:31.291
What?

20:32.250 --> 20:33.708
[honking]

20:39.958 --> 20:41.500
What've you done with our mother?

20:41.583 --> 20:43.791
You know my rule
about no bouncing on the bed?

20:43.875 --> 20:45.000
Wanna bounce on the bed?

20:45.083 --> 20:46.875
-Yes!
-[Nando] Sure!

20:47.458 --> 20:48.500
Do it! Do it!

21:00.708 --> 21:03.083
Sorry, guys, no screen time today.

21:03.166 --> 21:04.958
-Are you serious?
-Sorry, Mama.

21:05.041 --> 21:07.375
The entire day you can't use anything
that has a screen.

21:07.458 --> 21:10.583
That means no cell phones,
no laptops, no iPads, nada.

21:10.666 --> 21:13.375
What? Can I at least tell them
that I'll be off the grid?

21:13.458 --> 21:14.916
-Please?
-I'm not the boss.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.291
Okay, fine. You have one minute.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.958
-Starting 30 seconds ago. Come on!
-Okay, okay!

21:19.041 --> 21:23.541
Hey, hey, don't ship the speakers
until I get regulatory approval.

21:23.625 --> 21:26.625
Yeah, the speaker…
You know what? Forget it. I'll text you.

21:26.708 --> 21:27.916
Sorry, Dad. Time's up.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.666
You knew to be prepared.

21:29.750 --> 21:31.750
And we are so glad
that you're so prepared.

21:31.833 --> 21:34.458
Ellie wants to get you dressed
and do your hair and makeup.

21:34.541 --> 21:35.958
I have a vision.

21:36.541 --> 21:38.791
Oh, but I have this shirt.

21:38.875 --> 21:40.416
-[Ellie] Sorry.
-Ah.

21:44.083 --> 21:46.458

you're using your watercolors.

as crazy as possible?

Yes.

21:57.125 --> 21:59.958
-Should Nando skate in the house?
-Yes.

22:00.041 --> 22:01.791
Do you think we should get a dog?

22:01.875 --> 22:04.791

-Okay.

22:34.958 --> 22:37.125
How many makeovers have you had?

22:37.208 --> 22:38.041
Before this one?

22:38.125 --> 22:38.958
None.

22:42.250 --> 22:43.500
-Thank you.
-What's that?

22:43.583 --> 22:45.583
We made a list of our five big asks.

22:45.666 --> 22:49.375
For the day to be a success,
we have to make it through all five.

22:49.458 --> 22:50.833

we can tell you about it is nothing.

Oh, okay.

I'll be gone for the main event.
I'll be at Fleekfest.

23:17.916 --> 23:19.500
It's gonna be so much fun!

23:19.583 --> 23:23.125
I've been memorizing all the lyrics to
the H-E-R songs, and they're really good.

Julie not to get her hopes up.

and I'm gonna win.

30:14.500 --> 30:16.083
new clothes.

30:16.166 --> 30:17.708
Here you go, Katie.

30:17.791 --> 30:19.583
And this is for Dad.

30:19.666 --> 30:21.333
Are we starting a dance crew?

30:21.416 --> 30:23.375
You wish we were starting a dance crew.

30:23.458 --> 30:24.666
[birds chirping]

30:28.958 --> 30:30.458
[Carlos] Seriously, what are we doing?

30:30.541 --> 30:31.583
[indistinct chatter]

30:33.000 --> 30:34.625
[Allison] Are those water balloons?

30:35.458 --> 30:36.333
[Ellie] Kablowey!

30:36.416 --> 30:37.708
-[Nando] Yeah!
-What's Kablowey?

30:37.791 --> 30:41.750
It's capture the flag meets paintball
meets a butt ton of Kool-Aid.

30:41.833 --> 30:45.375
A game Katie learned at camp. We played
once with the kids in the neighborhood.

30:45.458 --> 30:48.750
[Katie] Yeah, Mom was the first one out.
It was so embarrassing.

30:48.833 --> 30:50.583
[Nando]
Only true warriors survive Kablowey.

30:50.666 --> 30:53.708
-It was a disaster.
-Oh, but not today. Today we'll Kablowey.

30:53.791 --> 30:55.041
-Today we'll Kablowey.
-Yes!

30:55.125 --> 30:58.250
[Allison] Where did you come up
with all of these people?

30:58.333 --> 31:02.750
We told them there'd be a casting director
for a new, sexy, romantic reality show.

31:03.333 --> 31:04.416
That's you, Mom.

31:04.500 --> 31:06.958
Yeah, Insatiable Island.

31:07.041 --> 31:08.041
[scoffs]

31:08.125 --> 31:10.000
Come on, guys. Hey, guys!

31:10.083 --> 31:14.041
[Allison] Insatiable Island? All right.
I'm in it to win it. Let's do this!

31:14.833 --> 31:15.666
[Carlos] Hey.

31:15.750 --> 31:17.958
Mr. Torres! You're on a Yes Day!

31:18.041 --> 31:21.083
-Way to go!
-Yeah, yeah. What are you doing here?

31:21.166 --> 31:22.875
Nando asked me to be here. Yeah.

31:22.958 --> 31:25.875
-I'm gonna referee.
-You don't know anything about sports.

31:25.958 --> 31:29.541
I don't know anything about sports,
but you can't say no on a Yes Day, right?

31:29.625 --> 31:31.208
[chuckles] Okay, get in your spot.

31:31.291 --> 31:32.625
[drums playing]

31:34.041 --> 31:35.666
[Nando] Any of you jocks scared?

31:36.208 --> 31:37.250
Well, you should be!

31:37.958 --> 31:41.541
Anybody who wants to go home
to their mommy, now's your chance.

31:41.625 --> 31:44.166
Sir?
Who should I give my headshot to, sir?

31:46.375 --> 31:50.500
Sir, I was a runner-up season 12
on The Bachelorette, in case that helps.

31:50.583 --> 31:52.375
I was, uh, season 9.

31:52.458 --> 31:53.416
Season 13.

31:53.500 --> 31:54.333
Whatever!

31:54.416 --> 31:58.708
Each team has a color of flag to protect.
The goal is to catch the other team's flag

31:58.791 --> 32:01.250
without getting hit
by their Kool-Aid balloons.

32:01.333 --> 32:03.458
If you get Kablowey-ed, you're eliminated.

32:03.958 --> 32:06.166
When one team has all the flags,
game's over.

32:06.250 --> 32:08.458
Now, let's play some Kablowey!

32:08.541 --> 32:09.666
[referee whistles]

32:09.750 --> 32:11.916
-[Allison] Big Blue! Big Blue!
-[all] What? What?

32:12.000 --> 32:13.625
-[Allison] Break it down.
-[all] What?

32:13.708 --> 32:14.541
Okay.

32:14.625 --> 32:16.875
-Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
-[whistling]

32:16.958 --> 32:18.958
-Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
-[whistling]

32:19.041 --> 32:21.750
That's enough of that.
That's a little awkward for everyone.

32:21.833 --> 32:24.250
All right, guys, here we go.

32:24.333 --> 32:28.166
Get your team's flag
and protect it like it's tots!

32:28.250 --> 32:31.291
On the count of three,
I want you to charge!

32:31.375 --> 32:32.708
Three, two…

32:32.791 --> 32:34.416
Wait. No, I screwed that up. Sorry.

32:35.333 --> 32:37.583
One, two…

32:39.750 --> 32:41.208
-three!

[triumphant music playing]

32:43.875 --> 32:45.375
[yelling]

32:53.125 --> 32:55.166
Mom's our strongest enemy.

32:55.250 --> 32:57.125
Let's go get her!

32:57.208 --> 32:58.500
[screaming]

32:59.791 --> 33:01.333
Don't worry about red.

33:01.416 --> 33:02.625
My husband's on defense.

33:02.708 --> 33:06.208
Don't worry about green. Katie's smart.
She's gonna go after her dad. Run!

33:06.291 --> 33:08.708
Okay, guys. Okay, just…
Defense is the key. Okay?

33:08.791 --> 33:12.375
Wait out here. Let them eliminate
each other. I know what I'm doing.

33:12.458 --> 33:15.041
Go, go! Red team. Red team.
My dad's team first!

33:15.125 --> 33:16.541
This is gonna be easy.

33:17.291 --> 33:18.333

33:24.041 --> 33:25.666
You in the headband, you're out!

33:26.166 --> 33:27.958
The other headband. [whistles]

33:30.500 --> 33:32.583
-Should we take a selfie?
-Yeah, sure.

33:32.666 --> 33:34.833
-Sweet.
-Tag me on Insta, 'kay?

33:34.958 --> 33:38.291
-One, two, three. Insatiable Island!
-Yeah!

33:39.375 --> 33:40.250
[spatters]

33:43.416 --> 33:45.875
Red team, what are you doing?
It's a bloodbath!

33:45.958 --> 33:48.041
Half your team is eliminated!

33:48.125 --> 33:51.625
Hold on. Change of strategy.
Run for your life. Billy, get out of here!

33:52.583 --> 33:54.750
I love the smell
of Kool-Aid in the morning.

33:57.166 --> 33:58.458
[slow swooshing]

33:58.541 --> 33:59.541
[thudding]

33:59.625 --> 34:00.875
[dramatic music playing]

34:03.333 --> 34:05.708
[Allison] Wait a minute.
We're taking too many losses!

34:05.791 --> 34:06.916
[whistles] You're out!

34:07.416 --> 34:10.375
Too many casualties! Go back! Fall back!

34:10.458 --> 34:11.500
Fall back, team!

34:12.250 --> 34:13.208
New strategy.

34:13.666 --> 34:15.250
Ma'am. Hi, my name's Eric.

34:15.333 --> 34:18.916
-I'm here to make muscles, not friends.
-I'm more shredded. Check this out.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.166
I have a very relatable body.
It's great for TV.

34:21.250 --> 34:23.666
For TV. Insatiable Island.
Put your clothes on.

34:23.750 --> 34:25.833
We're getting killed. I need that bag.

34:26.500 --> 34:27.750
Load me up with ammo!

34:27.833 --> 34:29.458
-Get her ammo!
-Bring it!

34:30.125 --> 34:33.291
Blue, who wiped your bottoms
when you were babies?

34:33.375 --> 34:34.625
-My mom!
-Our moms!

34:34.708 --> 34:37.833
-Who tied your shoes when you were babies?
-Our moms!

34:37.916 --> 34:39.458
Fight for your mom!

34:39.541 --> 34:42.000
-Go, Blue!
-Go, Blue!

You're out!

35:02.583 --> 35:03.708
Go!

35:03.791 --> 35:04.708
Do you see them?

35:04.791 --> 35:07.125
Destroy my beautiful children!

35:07.208 --> 35:08.333
Oh.

35:08.416 --> 35:09.875
You are going down!

35:09.958 --> 35:11.583
[Katie] Oh, this is bad.

35:11.666 --> 35:13.583
You wanted to make me a warrior?

35:13.666 --> 35:15.458
I'm a warrior!

35:15.541 --> 35:17.958
Listen, I think we need to team up
to take her out.

35:19.041 --> 35:19.916
Deal.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.125
Is that fair?

35:21.208 --> 35:24.041
All's fair in love and Kablowey.

35:24.125 --> 35:25.375
Go for it.

35:35.208 --> 35:37.250
That was perfect. It's messing her up.

35:37.333 --> 35:39.958
-Yeah.
-Are you playing dirty, Nando?

35:40.041 --> 35:42.041
[laughing wickedly]

35:44.750 --> 35:46.291

35:46.375 --> 35:48.500
[Nando] I don't see her. Where is she?

35:48.583 --> 35:50.125
Do you see which way she went?

35:50.208 --> 35:51.791
[Nando] No, I didn't. Let's go.

36:14.291 --> 36:15.416
Yeah!

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Mrs. Torres got the red flag!

36:34.083 --> 36:36.500
If she gets the green flag, she wins!

36:36.583 --> 36:38.541
-How'd you let that happen?
-What?

36:39.958 --> 36:42.250
Hey, Brian,
can I use your phone for a sec?

36:43.041 --> 36:44.833
I just gotta deal with a work thing.

36:44.916 --> 36:47.083
Will you put in
a good word with your wife?

36:47.166 --> 36:48.000
Sure.

36:48.958 --> 36:50.208
Wait. Hold up. Hold up.

36:51.166 --> 36:55.375
Mom, come on. It's over.
You don't even have any balloons left.

36:56.500 --> 36:57.666
[Spanish music playing]

36:57.750 --> 37:00.666
[in Spanish] Then why is there fear
in your eyes, daughter?

37:02.083 --> 37:05.500
[in Spanish] No, no, you have more fear.

37:06.208 --> 37:07.208
Tú.

37:07.291 --> 37:08.375
No. ¡Tú!

Whoo!

37:49.750 --> 37:51.208
[in English] Yeah!

37:51.791 --> 37:54.583
We shipped the nano-cams?
We don't have clearance yet.

37:55.083 --> 37:56.541
Tell Alan to issue a recall.

-Honey.

-No. Phone? No, no.

I was just out here looking at…
Taking in the nature. I love nature.

38:06.708 --> 38:09.333

Oh, she fell out of her nest.

38:22.833 --> 38:23.958
Yeah.

38:26.125 --> 38:27.416
We have to put her back.

38:27.500 --> 38:30.041
-What?
-I thought you loved nature.

38:31.958 --> 38:34.041
Yeah, honey, but it's a very tall tree.

If you help the birdie, Daddy,

I saw you talking on a phone.

It's gonna be awesome.

Are you sure you need
that much baking soda?

40:22.041 --> 40:24.000
Yeah, it's a better catalyst.

40:24.083 --> 40:26.666
Trust me. I'm an expert on catalysts now.

There's been a horrific bird attack.

40:42.916 --> 40:44.333
What? Do I have rabies?

40:44.416 --> 40:48.458
No, this hospital sucks, so I exaggerated
a little to goose 'em. No pun intended.

-She's kidding. You're kidding, right?
-Sure.

-Okay.

so I can find you later.

-Stay. It's okay.

40:59.458 --> 41:01.791
Okay, Mr. Torres, you can relax.

41:01.875 --> 41:04.208
The scratches are superficial.
You'll be fine.

41:04.291 --> 41:08.500
Oh good. So no concussion,
no rabies, no bruises? He's good to go?

41:08.583 --> 41:09.416
He's in the clear.

41:09.500 --> 41:11.583
-I'll send in a nurse to discharge you.
-Thank you.

-You're okay. That's great.
-Yeah.

I will get the kids,
and you take your time.

41:20.208 --> 41:23.833
Honey, I hate to be a party pooper,
but my body's done.

41:23.916 --> 41:25.750
Can we finish this another day, please?

41:27.208 --> 41:28.041
Really?

41:28.916 --> 41:29.750
Yeah.

41:30.500 --> 41:33.833
Yeah, I guess if you're not feeling well,
of course we'll go home.

41:33.916 --> 41:35.791
-Thank you.
-[Allison] Gosh.

41:35.875 --> 41:38.250
Maybe I'll pop by the office,
then go home and crash.

41:38.333 --> 41:40.250
-Sorry. What'd you say?
-Hm?

41:41.875 --> 41:44.416
Maybe I'll pop by the office.

41:44.500 --> 41:48.666
So you don't feel well enough
to finish this day for our family,

41:48.750 --> 41:51.375
but you do feel well enough
to pop by the office.

41:51.458 --> 41:54.625
It's a little crisis
that happened this morning.

41:54.708 --> 41:58.625
Carlos, you want to cancel this day,
that's your choice,

41:58.708 --> 42:00.041
but you're telling the kids.

42:00.125 --> 42:02.375
[in Spanish]
It's your turn to be the bad guy.

42:08.208 --> 42:10.416
Oh, Mrs. T. Hey, get this.

42:10.500 --> 42:14.208
I told Karen I'd give her a Yes Day,
and she doesn't even want it.

42:14.291 --> 42:17.208
We have an ambulance with a siren.

42:17.291 --> 42:18.750
Think of the possibilities.

42:18.833 --> 42:20.833
Grow up, Jean. Seriously.

42:22.750 --> 42:24.500
How about you lighten up, Karen?

42:24.583 --> 42:26.083
Take a chill pill.

42:27.875 --> 42:29.083
Are you okay?

42:29.166 --> 42:33.000
Yeah, I… I just got into a fight
with my husband.

42:33.083 --> 42:35.166
Ah, and you want me to beat him up?

42:35.250 --> 42:37.208
No, nothing like that.

42:37.291 --> 42:38.541
[Jean] Give him a wedgie?

42:38.625 --> 42:42.375
No, no. It's just that today was
the first day in, like, a year

42:42.458 --> 42:45.125
where I felt like
we were really in it together.

42:45.208 --> 42:48.291
-[Jean] Yeah.
-And then he just had to go and be a wuss.

42:48.375 --> 42:49.291
Sounds like Karen.

42:49.375 --> 42:53.416
She's mad because I took our life savings
and bought a fleet of ambulances.

42:53.500 --> 42:55.458
I barely know how to drive this one.

42:55.541 --> 42:57.416
But you can't force people to change.

42:57.500 --> 42:59.125
You gotta do what works for you,

42:59.208 --> 43:02.208
and he can either join the party,
or it's his loss. You know?

43:02.291 --> 43:04.000
That's so true.

43:06.083 --> 43:07.041
Oh.

43:07.125 --> 43:08.041
Hey, guys.

43:08.125 --> 43:09.958
Honey, can I talk to you for a second?

43:10.583 --> 43:11.416
Yeah.

43:14.833 --> 43:16.208
Look, I… I feel real bad.

43:16.291 --> 43:18.125
I don't want to be the spoiler here.

43:18.208 --> 43:21.208
Well, don't feel bad.
You are not the spoiler.  You do you.

43:21.291 --> 43:23.583
You can either come to this party or not.

43:23.666 --> 43:24.583
Okay?

43:25.291 --> 43:28.791
Hey guys, let me see what you got.
Big ask number four. Let me see.

43:28.875 --> 43:32.250
Okay, number four. Putts N' Stuff.

43:32.333 --> 43:34.333
That'd be very cool.
We'd have a great time.

43:34.416 --> 43:36.375
But it does not compare

43:37.125 --> 43:38.458
to Magic Mountain!

-What?
-Whoo!

43:40.875 --> 43:42.958
But wait. What about the distance rule?

43:43.041 --> 43:44.958
I've decided to make an exception.

43:45.041 --> 43:47.250
And your dad has something
he wants to say.

43:50.291 --> 43:51.125
Go ahead, Dad.

I'm… I'm feeling a little…

43:59.125 --> 44:00.708
I'm feeling a little bit sick.

You're sick?

44:02.250 --> 44:03.416
Are you going home?

44:08.916 --> 44:12.625
I think I might be coming down
with Magic Mountain fever!

44:16.083 --> 44:18.166
-But how are we gonna get there?
-Yeah.

44:18.250 --> 44:22.041
Because the SUV is at the Kablowey field,
and even with traffic, it'll take forever.

Uh, duh. It's Yes Day!

-Yeah!

Just so we're clear,

I gotta leave you on the side of the road.

if you want, but I brought clean clothes.

I took a stab.

50:32.541 --> 50:33.708
We took it everywhere,

50:33.791 --> 50:35.750
and she was so cute with her pigtails

50:35.833 --> 50:37.958
and her overalls
and a heart on the pocket.

50:38.041 --> 50:38.875
Yeah.

50:38.958 --> 50:41.041
Back when she loved me
and was my little buddy.

50:41.125 --> 50:41.958
I know.

50:42.041 --> 50:45.000
-What do you say? You wanna play?
-No, it's fine. Thank you.

50:45.500 --> 50:48.416
Carlos, I wanna play.
I'm gonna win Katie that gorilla.

50:48.500 --> 50:50.416
-Then she won't be mean to me.
-You sure?

50:51.208 --> 50:52.250
-Hi.
-Hi.

50:52.333 --> 50:54.291
I would like to win that, please.

50:54.375 --> 50:56.041
You'll have to beat this nice lady.

50:56.125 --> 50:58.416
Oh, okay. Hi. How are you?

50:58.916 --> 51:02.875
I need to win this pink gorilla
for my daughter, Katie. We're in a fight.

51:02.958 --> 51:05.625
[scoffs] What if…
What if I want to win that gorilla?

51:05.708 --> 51:07.625
I already have
the blue and brown gorillas.

51:07.708 --> 51:08.875
Now I need a pink one.

51:09.458 --> 51:12.958
Oh. Well, just go easy on me, okay?
Just, girl code.

51:13.666 --> 51:16.916
-Katie's not five years old anymore, okay?
-I know she's not.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.208
When she sees the gorilla,

51:18.291 --> 51:21.291
she'll know I'm her mama
and remember everything I've done for her.

51:21.375 --> 51:22.708
All right, ready?

51:22.791 --> 51:26.291
-I think that we should go.
-Don't distract me. I'm on a mission.

51:26.375 --> 51:27.625
Ready?

51:27.708 --> 51:29.208
-[bell rings]
-[woman] Toss!

51:29.291 --> 51:31.375
[carnival music playing]

51:31.458 --> 51:32.625
[monkey squeaking]

51:33.500 --> 51:34.375
[dings]

51:34.458 --> 51:35.541
You're going down, lady.

51:35.625 --> 51:37.000
[monkey squeaking]

51:38.166 --> 51:39.500
Ooh, it's so close!

51:39.583 --> 51:42.125
This is for driving her retainer
three hours to camp.

51:42.208 --> 51:43.166
[dings]

51:43.250 --> 51:45.166
This is for peeing every time I sneeze.

51:45.250 --> 51:47.750
-Will you be quiet?
-Okay, let's be good sports.

51:47.833 --> 51:50.166
This is for making me
sleep-train you three times.

51:50.250 --> 51:51.125
Shut up!

51:52.000 --> 51:52.833
[dings]

51:52.916 --> 51:55.291
-It's for my daughter, Katie!
-[woman 2] Quiet!

51:55.375 --> 51:57.541
-[dinging]
-[Allison laughs]

51:58.208 --> 52:00.500
I did it. Don't mess with Mama.

52:00.583 --> 52:02.958
No. No, no.

52:03.041 --> 52:04.083
I won.

52:04.166 --> 52:07.000
What? I just won.
I've never won anything. I just won.

52:07.083 --> 52:08.625
No,  I won by, like, a nose.

52:08.708 --> 52:09.750
Ah.

52:09.833 --> 52:11.291
Come on. We all saw it. She won.

52:11.375 --> 52:12.750
It was me. I won.

52:12.833 --> 52:14.333
-[Allison] Miss Cheetah?
-What?

52:14.416 --> 52:17.250
Can you tell her that I clearly won?
I was like a sniper.

52:17.750 --> 52:20.291
I am a freaking sniper, okay?

52:20.375 --> 52:23.250
-No, you are not. I won that gorilla!
-Honey!

52:23.333 --> 52:24.208
[Allison screams]

52:24.291 --> 52:26.708
-I'm staying out of this.
-[Carlos] It's not worth it!

52:26.791 --> 52:28.041
This is my gorilla!

52:28.125 --> 52:30.375
[woman 2]
You cheating suburban soccer mom!

52:30.458 --> 52:34.583
Hey! No, don't do this!
I got tickets here. Play again, okay?

52:34.666 --> 52:38.000
I shouldn't have to win it again.
You're a lawyer. You know about justice!

52:38.541 --> 52:39.791
-[thuds]
-[dings, rings]

52:39.875 --> 52:40.958
That's my wife!

52:41.875 --> 52:43.000
Get down!

52:43.083 --> 52:43.958
Security!

52:44.666 --> 52:45.791
[woman 2] You…

52:46.750 --> 52:48.916
No! Lady, please, no!

52:49.875 --> 52:51.500
Calm down! [grunts]

52:52.166 --> 52:55.166
Why does this keep happening to me? Honey.

52:55.250 --> 52:56.791
For my baby, give me the "golilla."

52:56.875 --> 53:00.750
If you are such a great mother,
then where are your kids?

53:03.250 --> 53:04.125
[grunts]

53:05.125 --> 53:06.000
No!

53:06.083 --> 53:08.208
Don't talk to me about my kids!

53:08.291 --> 53:09.416
Let go, lady!

53:09.500 --> 53:11.500
-Carlos, get this "golilla" for me!
-[Carlos] Let go!

53:11.583 --> 53:12.625
Is that all you got?

53:12.708 --> 53:13.833
It's for my baby!

53:13.916 --> 53:14.833
[thudding]

53:14.916 --> 53:16.208
[crowd groaning]

53:16.291 --> 53:19.875
-Where is that woman? Where is the…
-No, honey, stop! No, you…

53:19.958 --> 53:21.083
[siren blaring]

53:21.166 --> 53:22.416
[tires screeching]

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
-Who's watching our kids?
-I love the law. It's why I'm a lawyer.

53:27.083 --> 53:29.291
-[officer] Profile.
-Ellie usually has a snack around now.

53:29.375 --> 53:31.250
-[officer] Thumb.
-But there are laws, and laws.

53:31.333 --> 53:34.625
-Ma'am?
-There are organic smoothies in my bag.

53:34.708 --> 53:36.250
-Stand still, please.
-Oh.

53:36.333 --> 53:37.250
[shutter clicking]

53:37.333 --> 53:38.875
-Can I do that again?
-Chin up.

53:39.375 --> 53:40.291
Go ahead, Antonio.

53:41.125 --> 53:42.208
[shutter clicking]

53:42.916 --> 53:46.333
I put the picture of the bad guy
right here so that I will find you.

53:46.416 --> 53:48.791
-Whatever you look like.
-Can you make him bald?

53:48.875 --> 53:50.208
Oh, I don't know. Can I

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
make him bald? You know what I'm saying?

53:53.083 --> 53:54.125
He looks like you.

53:54.208 --> 53:55.333
Wait, what?

53:55.416 --> 53:56.250
I want a beard.

53:56.333 --> 53:57.458
Me too, you know?

53:57.541 --> 54:00.583
Oh, you mean… Oh, yes.
Sorry. I should've known. Uh…

54:00.666 --> 54:02.666
Let's see. [chuckles]

54:02.750 --> 54:05.125
-Nice soul patch, brother. Snap it. Okay?
-[Nando] Thank you.

54:05.208 --> 54:06.333
Do you have mohawks?

54:06.416 --> 54:07.791
-[officer] I do.
-Give him a mohawk.

54:07.875 --> 54:09.666
[officer] Okay, wait. Uh, ha, ha!

54:09.750 --> 54:11.375
Can you make him a pirate?

54:11.458 --> 54:13.458
Oh, that's too elaborate, you know?

54:13.541 --> 54:15.625
It would take a really awesome officer to…

54:15.708 --> 54:16.916
-Uh-oh.
-[Ellie] Whoa!

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
[officer] Captain Poopypants right here.

54:19.083 --> 54:20.583
Pirate Town. Pirate Town.

54:20.666 --> 54:22.625
I mean, it was your gorilla, honey.

54:22.708 --> 54:25.250
-Thank you. It was my gorilla.
-Yes.

54:25.333 --> 54:26.958
I hope you're happy, ya cheater.

54:27.541 --> 54:28.500
[growls]

54:28.583 --> 54:29.583
[inhales]

54:29.666 --> 54:32.708
You know what, honey? I don't think
you're mad about the gorilla.

54:32.791 --> 54:33.625
Really?

54:34.458 --> 54:35.666
Watching you with Katie…

54:37.500 --> 54:38.416
You're amazing.

54:38.500 --> 54:39.666
Hm.

54:39.750 --> 54:41.000
That's being a parent.

54:43.375 --> 54:46.083
All I've done is
force you to do the hard stuff, right?

54:48.416 --> 54:50.250
You don't need help from a Yes Day.

54:51.708 --> 54:53.208
What you need is a partner.

54:54.416 --> 54:56.166
That's what I'll be from now on,

54:56.833 --> 54:57.708
your partner.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.375
[in Spanish] I love you, my love.

55:01.458 --> 55:04.416
[in Spanish] Me too, my love. So much.

55:08.166 --> 55:09.041
[gags]

55:10.333 --> 55:11.416
[gags]

55:11.500 --> 55:14.666
[in English] Come on. Hey! Good news.
We're getting out of your hair.

55:14.750 --> 55:18.291
-Nana and Pop-Pop came to take us home.
-Those are cute nicknames.

55:18.375 --> 55:22.208
And really quickly,
I just wanted to say how sorry I am

55:22.291 --> 55:25.791
that you had to meet our parents this way.
They really are good people,

55:25.875 --> 55:26.833
just bad judgment.

55:26.916 --> 55:28.958
Oh, it's not your fault. You hear me?

55:29.041 --> 55:31.250
Where is Nana and Pop-Pop?

55:31.333 --> 55:32.166
What?

55:32.250 --> 55:34.000
So where is Nana and Pop-Pop?

55:34.708 --> 55:37.458
They're waiting in the car.
Yeah, they're waiting in the car.

55:37.541 --> 55:39.166
Our Pop-Pop's sciatica…

55:40.041 --> 55:41.000
really bad flareup.

55:41.083 --> 55:44.708
Oh Dios mío, no. Oh my God.
That sounds terrible. I am so sorry.

55:44.791 --> 55:47.791
-He's brave. Don't make him wait.
-We're gonna go. Thank you.

55:47.875 --> 55:49.958
I will sign you guys out. Best of luck.

55:50.041 --> 55:51.416
[Katie] Thank you. Bye.

55:51.500 --> 55:53.458
I'll be lonely without you,
but don't worry.

55:53.541 --> 55:54.916
I have other friends.

55:58.041 --> 55:58.875
Hey, Julie.

55:58.958 --> 55:59.833
Hey.

55:59.916 --> 56:03.041
Dude, I cannot believe
your parents are in jail.

56:03.125 --> 56:04.083
It's crazy, right?

56:04.625 --> 56:06.750
Are we really just gonna
leave Mom and Dad?

56:07.500 --> 56:10.458
It's not our fault
they got put in the clink on our Yes Day.

56:10.541 --> 56:13.041
But we're not supposed
to get rides from strangers.

56:13.125 --> 56:15.125
Okay, well, you guys know Layla,

56:15.208 --> 56:17.125
and Julie is Layla's cousin.

56:18.208 --> 56:20.541
I mean, look, they even put in a car seat.

56:20.625 --> 56:22.166
Think of the upside to this.

56:22.250 --> 56:24.750
Now your big main event
can be even bigger.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.375
[indistinct chatter]

56:32.375 --> 56:34.333
-Awesome.
-What is this?

56:34.416 --> 56:36.458
What's with all the tubes and buckets?

56:36.541 --> 56:39.333
-It's just a nerd party. Hey, guys!
-[kids chanting] Nando!

56:39.416 --> 56:42.250
I feel like this is something
that we should have talked…

56:42.333 --> 56:45.083
[Nando] Hey, wait up!
Let's get the party started!

56:45.166 --> 56:46.291
[cheering]

56:47.500 --> 56:48.708
[upbeat music playing]

56:53.291 --> 56:54.500
[laughing]

57:02.000 --> 57:03.875
[gasps] You look pretty!

57:04.500 --> 57:05.458
Thanks, Ellie.

57:10.083 --> 57:11.250
[sighs] I can't go.

57:11.333 --> 57:12.333
What?

57:12.416 --> 57:13.291
I can't go.

57:13.791 --> 57:16.625
I'm sorry. I can't leave them.
What if something happens?

57:16.708 --> 57:18.708
I'm the oldest. It's my responsibility.

57:18.791 --> 57:22.166
But you've wanted
to go to this concert forever.

57:22.250 --> 57:25.416
And we're gonna be fine.
We won't make poor decisions. Promise.

57:26.916 --> 57:28.916
Promise to text me if something happens?

57:29.000 --> 57:30.833
Absolutely.

57:30.916 --> 57:33.083
Come on, Katie.
The guys are already there.

57:35.250 --> 57:36.166
[sighs]

57:40.416 --> 57:42.208
Okay. Okay.

57:42.291 --> 57:43.416
Be safe, please.

57:44.916 --> 57:46.875
-[Allison] Are the kids okay?
-[officer] Yes.

57:46.958 --> 57:48.708
And I have some phenomenal news.

57:48.791 --> 57:50.250
The park's not pressing charges.

57:50.333 --> 57:51.291
-Thank God.
-Yes!

57:51.375 --> 57:55.250
They looked at some security footage,
and it turns out you did win the gorilla.

57:55.958 --> 57:58.625
I knew it.
I knew I won this gorilla. I knew I--

57:58.708 --> 57:59.541
[Carlos] Okay.

58:00.375 --> 58:01.416
[exhales deeply]

58:03.000 --> 58:05.125
-Does she get to go too?
-[officer] In a little bit.

58:05.208 --> 58:06.083
Oh.

58:07.166 --> 58:09.125
Oh gosh. Here, you have it.

58:09.208 --> 58:10.458
You take the "golilla."

58:10.541 --> 58:12.541
You won it fair and square.

58:13.208 --> 58:14.458
-Thank you.
-[officer] Let's go.

58:14.541 --> 58:15.375
Let's go.

58:17.500 --> 58:19.000
-Katie?
-[Carlos] Nando?

58:19.083 --> 58:21.666
Ellie? Where are our kids?

58:21.750 --> 58:24.500
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.
Nana and Pop-Pop picked them up.

58:24.583 --> 58:26.666
Nana and Pop-Pop live in Pittsburgh.

58:28.333 --> 58:29.791
But they're here on vacation?

58:29.875 --> 58:33.166
-No, they're not.
-You let our children leave by themselves?

58:33.250 --> 58:36.708
You see, when you say it out loud,
I… I realize that it was a mistake.

58:36.791 --> 58:37.625
-[gasps]
-Oh no.

58:37.708 --> 58:39.250
[upbeat music playing]

58:39.333 --> 58:40.833
[indistinct chatter]

58:44.166 --> 58:46.583
Can you believe this?

58:46.666 --> 58:50.166
We are actually pulling it off.
I'm gonna go check on the big surprise.

58:50.250 --> 58:52.333
Yeah. Okay. I'll see you over there, man.

58:58.666 --> 59:03.000
Who's ready to make some science miracles?

59:03.083 --> 59:04.541
[kids cheering]

59:05.333 --> 59:07.291
-Name?
-Hailey Peterson.

59:07.375 --> 59:08.875
I live across the street.

59:11.041 --> 59:13.208
Sorry, not on the list.

59:13.291 --> 59:14.208
Ugh.

59:14.291 --> 59:17.166
Just kidding.
I can't even read. Get on in here.

59:17.250 --> 59:18.375
-Yes.
-[Nando] Are you ready?

59:20.250 --> 59:21.416
[cheering]

59:22.791 --> 59:29.250
[all] Go, Nando! Go, Nando!
Go, Nando! Go, Nando! Go, Nando!

59:29.333 --> 59:30.666
[cheering]

59:33.125 --> 59:34.416
Nando's not picking up either.

59:34.500 --> 59:37.958
We know Katie's at Fleekfest, so
Nando and Ellie must be at the main event?

59:38.041 --> 59:39.000
Whatever that is.

59:39.083 --> 59:40.250
Oh, oh.

59:40.333 --> 59:43.250
Your kids left this here.
Do you mean this main event?

59:43.333 --> 59:45.958
Nerd party.
Where would you throw a nerd party?
