and then they'd yell stuff like
"Julian's screwed again."

12:50.511 --> 12:52.655
Stupid Brian Fernandez.

12:52.871 --> 12:54.195
I could probably help you
with that.

12:54.205 --> 12:55.137
Yeah?

12:55.147 --> 12:57.108
Well, not the bitter part
about Brian Fernandez,

12:57.118 --> 12:59.564
- But the hitting part.
- Okay, let's do it.

12:59.574 --> 13:01.517
Besides, we're probably gonna
have to kill some time, huh?

13:01.527 --> 13:02.689
Until what?

13:02.699 --> 13:05.268
Until you tell me
what went wrong.

13:05.278 --> 13:07.450
Bro, nothing went wrong.

13:09.242 --> 13:11.626
Man: Come on, kid.
Hung in there this long.

13:11.636 --> 13:12.956
Don't give up now.

Woman: You ever heard of anyone
surviving something like this?

13:16.190 --> 13:17.568
[ sighs ] no.

Jamie:
Can I ask you something?

14:09.159 --> 14:10.012
Sure.

14:10.022 --> 14:11.976
Have you had
your eyes checked lately?

14:11.986 --> 14:12.956
Thanks a lot.

14:13.476 --> 14:14.605
[ groans ]

14:15.415 --> 14:17.078
You know what -- if you're so
good at it, why don't you come out

14:17.088 --> 14:18.608
and show me what
you got, hot shot?

14:18.618 --> 14:19.850
Jamie: All right.

14:29.117 --> 14:30.716
Beginner's luck.

14:32.043 --> 14:33.508
Okay, I think
the machine's broken.

14:33.518 --> 14:35.492
It's totally
pitching slower now.

[ groans ]
Jamie: - It's not that hard.

14:45.758 --> 14:48.354
You just have to swing level.
Don't try to kill it.

14:48.364 --> 14:49.839
Okay.

14:51.304 --> 14:52.681
[ groans ]

14:54.015 --> 14:55.516
Lower your back shoulder
a little bit.

14:55.526 --> 14:56.467
Okay.

14:56.477 --> 14:57.740
- A little more.
- Yeah?

14:57.750 --> 14:59.545
Perfect.
Now swing level.

15:00.424 --> 15:01.762
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

15:01.772 --> 15:03.967
- Yeah! Nice!
- Yeah!

15:04.592 --> 15:06.487
That's the first hit
I've ever gotten in my life.

15:06.497 --> 15:08.123
Hit another one.

15:08.904 --> 15:11.515
Aah! Take that,
Brian Fernandez!

15:11.525 --> 15:12.870
You got to let it go,
dude.

15:12.880 --> 15:14.345
Yeah, I know.

15:14.588 --> 15:15.904
Ahh!

15:18.927 --> 15:20.337
Hey.

15:20.996 --> 15:22.312
Thanks.

15:24.761 --> 15:26.723
I thought
they were dead.

15:26.733 --> 15:28.889
I got worried when I didn't
hear from them since Utah,

15:28.899 --> 15:30.840
And...
I just had this feeling,

15:30.850 --> 15:32.295
and I should have
gone out there sooner.

15:32.305 --> 15:33.523
- Haley.
- I should have.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.039
And when Quinn
didn't call me back,

15:35.049 --> 15:36.297
I should have
gotten in the car,

15:36.307 --> 15:37.958
instead of being lazy,
and just gone --

15:37.968 --> 15:39.794
Haley, stop.

15:40.788 --> 15:42.068
You just got home from Utah,

15:42.078 --> 15:44.002
and you found out
that you're pregnant.

15:44.012 --> 15:46.933
It's amazing that you
went out there when you did.

15:46.943 --> 15:47.995
It's more than I would have done.

15:48.005 --> 15:50.826
Do not beat yourself up over this.

15:50.836 --> 15:52.599
You hear me?

15:53.318 --> 15:54.576
After everything
you've been through,

15:54.586 --> 15:56.256
It's not good for you.

15:56.550 --> 15:58.964
And it can't be good
for the baby.

15:59.399 --> 16:01.748
You did everything
you could, Hales.

16:03.082 --> 16:04.507
Now, what can I do for you?

[ exhales deeply ]

16:05.851 --> 16:07.568

to have you here.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.465
I love you,

I love you, too.

I just don't think
we say it enough,

16:16.375 --> 16:17.651
and I'm really sorry for that.

16:17.661 --> 16:18.847
Listen to me.

16:18.857 --> 16:20.202
Quinn made it
through surgery,

16:20.212 --> 16:22.089
and she can make it
all the way back.

16:22.099 --> 16:23.498
All right?

16:24.333 --> 16:26.371
She's a James girl.

16:28.419 --> 16:31.423
I just wish... The doctors
would tell me something.

16:31.433 --> 16:33.135
They're not telling me
anything.

16:33.145 --> 16:34.773
And now I have to talk
to the police.

16:34.783 --> 16:37.761
Oh, don't get me started
on the police.

16:41.199 --> 16:42.702
Long story.

16:42.712 --> 16:44.381
It's a long story --

16:44.391 --> 16:46.581
The reasons
I thought we should break up.

16:46.591 --> 16:48.131
You don't
have to explain it.

16:48.559 --> 16:50.225
No, I think I do.

16:51.104 --> 16:53.157
I just hadn't been back
in a long time,

16:53.167 --> 16:55.384
and every night,
I'd sit on the tour bus

16:55.394 --> 16:58.271
and have conversations
with the road.

16:58.661 --> 17:00.450
And what did the road
have to say?

17:00.786 --> 17:02.690
The road said
that a long-distance girlfriend

17:02.700 --> 17:05.752
who sleeps better on a bus
than she ever has in her own bed

17:05.762 --> 17:08.425
Is a gypsy and a nomad
and...

17:08.435 --> 17:10.336
No girlfriend at all.

17:11.867 --> 17:14.540
And then the night
agreed with the road, and...

17:14.906 --> 17:17.250
We all decided
that you deserve better.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.233
Well...

17:19.535 --> 17:21.973
I guess
I appreciate that, but...

17:22.296 --> 17:25.313
[ sighs ] the truth is,
your texts made it sound like

17:25.323 --> 17:27.578
You decided that
you deserved better.

17:29.023 --> 17:31.333
At least, whenever
you actually responded at all.

17:49.317 --> 17:51.695
So, how'd you get
this job, anyway?

17:51.705 --> 17:54.041
It's kind of a long story.

Chase if he was hiring

17:56.678 --> 17:58.240
when we were in Utah.

be on tv or something.

in movies or something.

Only, uh, mine's kind of
not on purpose. [ chuckles ]

celibate when you can't get laid.

19:19.428 --> 19:21.158
No sports,
no video games?

I watched
a lot of movies.

And I watched
a lot of people.

I used to watch people
and make up stories about them.

in a traveling carnival --

Okay, well, what about that guy?

19:53.388 --> 19:56.161
That guy... Hates tattoo guy
because tattoo guy

19:56.171 --> 19:58.025
called his graphic novels
"comic books."

19:58.035 --> 19:59.833
He also borrowed
his first-edition copy

19:59.843 --> 20:01.819
of "The Alcoholic"
and never gave it back.

is an alcoholic.

in that drink, too.

Isn't really that boy's mom.

fun stuff with him

about to bribe him

to be over.

commercial or something,

get the hell out of here.

You know how
you're always telling me

what a warrior I am?

22:47.045 --> 22:50.735
The truth is, you're the warrior.

22:52.779 --> 22:56.764
My life is so much better
because of you.

22:59.595 --> 23:02.558

"thank you" for that.

The doctors say it's a miracle
that you're even breathing.

23:18.902 --> 23:21.273
But I know that it's not.

23:22.392 --> 23:24.525
All this is nothing.

'Cause I know your spirit.

And I've seen
your strength.

Okay, so...

23:34.111 --> 23:35.520
Just...

23:36.340 --> 23:38.802
Just come back to us
when you can.

Because I never said
"thank you."

And I never said
"I love you."

buddy.

[ sighs ]

24:13.632 --> 24:15.640
You know,
I was thinking the other day

24:15.650 --> 24:18.139
about those little plays

24:18.149 --> 24:20.420
we used to put on
when we were little

24:20.430 --> 24:21.446
for the whole family.

24:21.456 --> 24:23.438
You know,
we would color invitations,

24:23.448 --> 24:25.377
and everybody
got all dressed up.

24:25.739 --> 24:28.298
We made snacks
and lemonade.

24:28.974 --> 24:32.058
And you always insisted
on singing and dancing.

24:32.449 --> 24:36.649
And you were...
Really terrible at both.

24:39.638 --> 24:43.878
And you turned into
this... beautiful swan.

24:46.467 --> 24:48.927
I was so proud of you.

24:56.474 --> 24:59.528
I went to the beach house
to tell you that...

25:00.583 --> 25:02.482
I'm pregnant.

And I want you
to be the godmother,

25:06.280 --> 25:07.518

They say you don't know
what you've got till it's gone.

25:15.588 --> 25:18.253
And I guess I didn't know
how much I missed you

25:18.263 --> 25:21.153
till you were in
my life every day.

25:22.744 --> 25:24.951
How much I needed you.

Come home soon, Quinny.

25:34.927 --> 25:36.005
And if you see mom,

25:36.015 --> 25:40.086
you tell her to send you
right back here to me...

25:40.564 --> 25:42.839
Because we have
invitations to make

25:43.304 --> 25:46.000
and stories to write.

the godmother.

26:12.872 --> 26:14.358
You will be.

26:15.569 --> 26:17.396
Come on.

26:24.305 --> 26:26.044
It's beautiful.

26:27.077 --> 26:29.961
I was gonna take you here
before we went to Utah.

26:29.971 --> 26:31.871
Well, why didn't you?

26:33.076 --> 26:35.369
I just got busy, you know?

26:35.379 --> 26:37.531
I thought
that we had more time.

26:39.321 --> 26:43.104
Hey, but promise me that
you'll go back here someday.

26:43.393 --> 26:46.387
We'll go. Together.

that you'll take the time

happy and fortunate.

26:57.407 --> 26:59.629
Clay, why are you
telling me these things?

27:00.008 --> 27:02.541
Because
those things don't matter.

I got arrested today.

27:22.991 --> 27:25.147
- What?
- Why? What happened?

27:25.157 --> 27:28.149
Apparently, my lovely
mother and Millicent

27:28.159 --> 27:29.997
lied about the company's earnings

27:30.007 --> 27:32.066

bunch of documents

27:32.076 --> 27:33.892

Brooke,
how bad can this get?

I don't know.

27:41.974 --> 27:43.259
I met with our attorney
this morning.

They're saying
some things, but...

27:44.968 --> 27:46.155
Brooke.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.868
How bad can it get?

27:48.107 --> 27:50.088
I could lose the company.

27:50.471 --> 27:51.830
Oh, my god.

27:51.840 --> 27:53.231
Why didn't you
say anything?

27:53.241 --> 27:55.722
Because it's not
life and death.

27:55.732 --> 27:57.989
Because I haven't even
really congratulated you

27:57.999 --> 27:58.811

27:58.821 --> 28:01.905
I am so happy
for you guys.

28:01.915 --> 28:02.805
But I had a thought.

28:02.815 --> 28:06.132
If you really like the new baby,
can I have Jamie?

28:06.142 --> 28:07.304
Yeah, you can have him.

28:07.314 --> 28:09.664
But you have to have
the sex talk with him first.

28:09.994 --> 28:11.238
Already?

28:11.423 --> 28:13.078
It's like yesterday
he was...

28:13.088 --> 28:15.712
Going on treasure hunts
with Quinn.

28:27.655 --> 28:29.642
It's my aunt Quinn, isn't it?

28:29.652 --> 28:31.936
Something happened
to my aunt Quinn.

28:31.946 --> 28:33.356
Why would you say that?

28:34.098 --> 28:36.632
Well, because she was
supposed to pick me up today.

28:36.642 --> 28:39.438
And she never misses
her day with me.

28:42.207 --> 28:45.515
Yeah, buddy. Your aunt
Quinn's in the hospital.

28:49.699 --> 28:52.359
Well, I'm glad they
sent you to pick me up.

28:53.432 --> 28:55.905
You don't just treat me
like a kid.

28:57.523 --> 28:59.959
So, can we go
to the hospital now?

29:00.558 --> 29:02.867
Let me call your mom
and check.

30:48.579 --> 30:51.483
I'm really sorry about
Clothes over Bros, Millie.

30:51.493 --> 30:53.205
I'm just sorry for Brooke.

30:53.215 --> 30:56.113
She trusted me, and I
let her down -- again.

30:56.545 --> 30:58.393
There's got to be
some leniency, though, right?

30:58.403 --> 31:00.510
I mean, you make restitution
to the investors

31:00.520 --> 31:02.089
and you pay a fine
or something.

31:02.099 --> 31:05.186
I don't think it's that simple.
It's a federal offense.

31:05.606 --> 31:08.297
Hey, bitch!
What's the haps?

31:09.691 --> 31:12.341
Are you guys
totally re-hooking it up?

31:14.328 --> 31:17.172
Okay. Sorry.
I'm gonna walk away.

31:18.693 --> 31:21.066
So, how's Brooke doing
with her mom?

31:30.875 --> 31:33.342
You were never proud of me,
were you?

31:33.651 --> 31:35.481
Why would you
say that?

31:35.491 --> 31:37.524
Because if you were
proud of me,

31:38.607 --> 31:41.824
if you believed in me
and in the men's line,

31:41.834 --> 31:43.781
you wouldn't have lied.

31:44.197 --> 31:45.247
You wouldn't have felt
the need

31:45.257 --> 31:49.043
to make Clothes over Bros
seem better than it is.

31:49.412 --> 31:51.023
Is that
what you think?

31:51.272 --> 31:52.970
Yeah, it is.

31:52.980 --> 31:54.454
Well, you're wrong.

31:54.464 --> 31:56.438
It's because I did believe.

31:56.448 --> 31:59.701
I thought I could lie to them
because I did believe in you,

31:59.736 --> 32:01.791
because I've seen you do
amazing things.

32:01.801 --> 32:03.474
And in the face
of a poor economy,

32:03.484 --> 32:06.268
I refused to believe
that you wouldn't do it again.

32:08.749 --> 32:11.781
I gamble on your talent, Brooke.

32:12.450 --> 32:14.322
I gamble
on your instinct

32:14.332 --> 32:17.131
and your ability to
make miracles happen.

32:17.366 --> 32:19.785
And I'm usually right.

32:20.161 --> 32:22.799
Gambling is
what you pay me to do.

32:25.590 --> 32:29.278
That other stuff --
that "I'm proud of you" part --

32:30.383 --> 32:32.696
I always did that
for free.

32:34.824 --> 32:37.501
It's always been
the easy part.

32:53.755 --> 32:55.394
What do you mean
I have to leave you now?

32:55.404 --> 32:56.667
I mean you have to go back.

32:56.677 --> 32:57.928
With you.

32:57.938 --> 32:58.955
Quinn, you've been
saying it yourself.

32:58.965 --> 33:00.912
You're feeling weak.
You know why that is?

33:00.922 --> 33:01.957
Because your body's healing,

33:01.967 --> 33:03.325
so it's getting ready
to leave this place.

33:03.335 --> 33:04.360

things like that, okay?

gonna leave you.

a choice.

not to live.

to the baby.

from Omaha for me.

And I came back
to a good job.

38:12.698 --> 38:14.208
The rest of it
was my doing, Millie,

Till kingdom come.

40:39.421 --> 40:40.871
Now open your eyes.

40:41.755 --> 40:44.614
I don't want to -- not if
it means losing you, Clay.

40:44.624 --> 40:45.661
I can't.

40:45.671 --> 40:47.229
It won't.

40:47.532 --> 40:49.355
I promise you.

40:54.983 --> 40:57.098
Till kingdom come.

40:59.837 --> 41:01.541
I love you.

41:01.551 --> 41:03.895
Now open your eyes.

41:13.600 --> 41:15.679
Till kingdom come.
