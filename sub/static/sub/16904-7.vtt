WEBVTT

00:02.013 --> 00:04.131
- How's it going in there?
- Great.

00:04.251 --> 00:06.739
Trying on jeans is my favorite thing.

00:06.859 --> 00:10.047
Maybe later I can get a paps mirror
from an old male doctor.

00:10.167 --> 00:12.812
Oh, come on, Liz.
This store is cool.

00:12.932 --> 00:14.496
It's huge with all the young people.

00:14.616 --> 00:16.470
I mean... all the us.

00:16.722 --> 00:18.748
This place is trying way too hard.

00:18.868 --> 00:20.735
Why are there straightjackets
everywhere?

00:20.803 --> 00:22.203
Because before this was
a clothing store,

00:22.271 --> 00:23.571
it was a mental hospital.

00:23.639 --> 00:24.906
It's winky and fun, Liz.

00:24.974 --> 00:28.860
Okay, I tried them on.
Can we go now?

00:28.944 --> 00:30.478
Liz Lemon, you look hot.

00:30.546 --> 00:32.146
Really?

00:32.214 --> 00:34.949
I swear to Kaballah monster.

00:35.017 --> 00:37.085
Those jeans are perfect.
Look at your butt.

00:37.152 --> 00:39.821
<i>Oh, my God.
Is that me?</i>

00:39.872 --> 00:40.989
Liz, it's the dream.

00:41.056 --> 00:42.757
Boy on the bottom,
girl on the top.

00:42.825 --> 00:46.411
<i>O.M. God,
those jeans are zing!</i>

00:46.495 --> 00:50.231
This online slang dictionary
says it's short for "amazing."

00:50.299 --> 00:52.634
Or it's a club drug made
from a tooth whitener.

00:52.701 --> 00:53.902
Either way you win.

00:53.969 --> 00:56.588
I'll wear these jeans out, and
I'll take ten more pairs!

00:56.672 --> 00:59.574
'Tastic. Shall I put the pants
you had on in with the jeans?

00:59.642 --> 01:01.609
No. Burn them.

01:01.677 --> 01:03.344
<i>Burn them!</i>

01:05.480 --> 01:16.081
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:21.397 --> 01:23.531
I'm sorry I was late
this morning, sir.

01:23.582 --> 01:26.568
- I was attacked in my apartment...
- Quiet.

01:26.635 --> 01:27.752
Congressional candidate
Regina Bookman...

01:27.836 --> 01:29.103
Are they really talking
about that woman?

01:29.171 --> 01:31.573
...Making political hay
out of the wheat field

01:31.640 --> 01:33.841
that is the NBC-Kabletown
merger...

01:33.909 --> 01:36.811
Who wrote this?
Jared, honestly?

01:36.879 --> 01:38.613
Bookman told reporters, quote,

01:38.681 --> 01:41.966
"The merger of NBC and Kabletown
is bad for the consumer.

01:42.051 --> 01:43.935
"I don't trust
their executive leadership,

01:44.019 --> 01:45.803
<i>"and Kabletown still has
an auxiliary button</i>

01:45.871 --> 01:47.555
"on their remote.

01:47.623 --> 01:48.840
"What is that for?

01:48.908 --> 01:50.325
It just makes the screen
go blue."

01:50.392 --> 01:52.293
Why is she still talking
about the merger?

01:52.361 --> 01:54.629
She said I had three months
to make NBC more diverse.

01:54.697 --> 01:55.630
It's not your fault
nobody watched

01:55.698 --> 01:57.699
<i>America's next top black guy.</i>

01:57.766 --> 01:59.601
Bookman, amping up
the rhetoric in a tight race.

01:59.668 --> 02:01.235
Polls have her in a dead heat

02:01.303 --> 02:03.204
with out-of-nowhere challenger
Steven Austin.

02:03.272 --> 02:07.041
Wait a second.
There's a chance she could lose?

02:07.109 --> 02:09.176
Bookman is obviously holding
a gun to my head.

02:09.244 --> 02:11.963
And no matter what I do,
she obviously wants me to fail.

02:12.047 --> 02:14.449
But if she loses...
This isn't a conversation!

02:14.516 --> 02:15.917
But if she loses,

02:15.985 --> 02:18.219
I won't have to worry
about her scuttling the merger.

02:18.287 --> 02:20.421
Jonathan,
get her opponent in here.

02:20.489 --> 02:24.125
Whoever he is, he just made
a very powerful friend.

02:24.193 --> 02:26.427
I thought you said you didn't
need any more friends.

02:32.651 --> 02:34.519
'Zing leg-tubes, Liz.

02:34.603 --> 02:35.937
Vunderhinder!

02:36.005 --> 02:37.355
They're from Brooklyn Without Limits.

02:37.439 --> 02:40.341
It's this very cool store
with locations in Gay Town,

02:40.409 --> 02:43.811
White Harlem, and the Van
Beardswick section of Brooklyn.

02:43.879 --> 02:44.812
And they don't just look great.
See the tag?

02:44.863 --> 02:47.281
"Handmade in U.S.A."

02:47.333 --> 02:50.484
Because BWL is all about
fair trade

02:50.536 --> 02:53.488
and local artisans
and staying green.

02:53.555 --> 02:55.156
These jeans totally make up

02:55.224 --> 02:58.292
for all the times I took a long,
hot shower because I was bored.

02:58.360 --> 03:00.028
I'm so excited for you, Liz.

03:00.095 --> 03:01.963
Now we both have amazing butts.

03:02.014 --> 03:05.266
Make that all three of us.
Jenna, a word.

03:05.334 --> 03:07.635
Specifically,
the word "talking."

03:07.703 --> 03:10.338
Oh, and look at this.

03:10.406 --> 03:13.307
J-train, as you may know,
I was in a film

03:13.375 --> 03:14.776
<i>called Hard to Watch.</i>

03:14.843 --> 03:17.178
<i>And the pundits think
I have a chance</i>

03:17.246 --> 03:20.064
<i>at an Oscar, and I just learned
about air quotes.</i>

03:20.149 --> 03:22.016
Yes. I talked about
your movie

03:22.084 --> 03:24.318
with my therapist
last week for 20 hours.

03:24.386 --> 03:25.653
I know this is difficult
for you.

03:25.704 --> 03:26.954
I'm fine.

03:27.022 --> 03:29.323
Talking with Dr. Linda
helped me realize

03:29.391 --> 03:31.459
I have just as much
going on in my life.

03:31.527 --> 03:33.861
My exercise video
is dropping soon.

03:33.929 --> 03:35.863
<i>It's called
Jenna Gets Hard.</i>

03:38.917 --> 03:42.053
Well, if you're okay talking
about it, I need your help.

03:42.137 --> 03:44.338
These reporters want to
come do a story on me.

03:44.390 --> 03:45.840
They're from something called

03:45.908 --> 03:48.676
the Hollywood
foreign press association.

03:48.744 --> 03:50.445
HOFPA?

03:50.512 --> 03:52.947
- Yeah.
- That's the Golden Globes.

03:53.015 --> 03:56.084
The second-most-important awards
in Hollywood...

03:56.151 --> 03:58.853
After the People's Choice
Awards...

03:58.921 --> 04:01.389
Where the fans are in charge.

04:01.457 --> 04:02.457
So what do you think
I should do?

04:02.524 --> 04:06.060
You could have a special screening for them...
host a luncheon.

04:06.128 --> 04:11.199
And when the time is right...
Be bad at snapping. Got it.

04:11.266 --> 04:15.136
No, Tracy.
You could try to bribe them.

04:15.204 --> 04:19.474
I mean, a Golden Globe is
a stepping stone to an Oscar.

04:19.541 --> 04:21.709
How bad do you want it?

04:21.777 --> 04:24.979
I'm not an expert at morality,
but isn't that wrong?

04:25.047 --> 04:29.350
You're asking me?

04:29.418 --> 04:32.887
So this is the man who's
gonna bring down Regina Bookman.

04:32.955 --> 04:36.157
Rhode Island's own
Steven Austin!

04:36.225 --> 04:38.476
Actually, I go by Steve Austin.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.311
That way people see
my name on ballots,

04:40.395 --> 04:42.814
they think I'm the wrestler,
and they vote for me.

04:42.898 --> 04:44.332
I've been reading up
on you, Steve.

04:44.399 --> 04:46.934
Honestly, I want to like you.

04:47.002 --> 04:50.271
But I see that you're not affiliated
with the republican party.

04:50.322 --> 04:51.989
The party system
is broken, Jack.

04:52.074 --> 04:53.074
I don't believe in parties.

04:53.142 --> 04:56.644
I don't join 'em, and I never get
invited to 'em...Hint, hint.

04:56.712 --> 04:57.745
You're an individual.

04:57.813 --> 05:00.665
A Maverick.

05:00.749 --> 05:01.949
People like you are succeeding

05:02.000 --> 05:04.085
because Americans are fed up
with the status quo.

05:04.153 --> 05:05.636
Exactly.

05:05.721 --> 05:06.854
They're tired of the direction
this country's headed in.

05:06.922 --> 05:08.790
They want to return
to our past glory.

05:08.857 --> 05:10.424
They want an American
renaissance!

05:10.492 --> 05:11.459
I like what I'm hearing, Steve.

05:11.527 --> 05:14.395
Then you're gonna love
the sound of this.

05:14.463 --> 05:15.963
Goo goo gaa gaa, Jack.

05:16.031 --> 05:17.298
What's that?

05:17.366 --> 05:18.733
That's the theme
of my campaign.

05:18.800 --> 05:20.601
Renaissance means rebirth.

05:20.669 --> 05:23.738
I want to usher in
the rebirth of this country.

05:23.806 --> 05:26.174
That's why the theme
of all my campaign commercials

05:26.241 --> 05:28.042
is "I'm a baby."

05:28.110 --> 05:30.178
This country has lost its way.

05:30.245 --> 05:33.214
We need to start over and return
to what made our nation great.

05:33.282 --> 05:34.816
My name is Steve Austin,

05:34.883 --> 05:36.717
and I'm a lifelong resident
of Rhode Island,

05:36.785 --> 05:38.753
and the manager of a local
paintball facility.

05:38.821 --> 05:40.588
I will clean out Washington,

05:40.655 --> 05:42.990
like it's the bathroom
of a paintball facility.

05:43.058 --> 05:44.542
Vote Steve Austin.

05:44.626 --> 05:47.094
And if you're blind,
I am the wrestler.

05:47.162 --> 05:48.629
Right.

05:48.697 --> 05:50.598
I like a lot
of what you're saying, Steve,

05:50.666 --> 05:52.717
but before I throw
my support behind you,

05:52.801 --> 05:54.101
I do have a litmus test.

05:54.169 --> 05:56.470
Okay. Can I take that
in two weeks?

05:56.538 --> 05:57.839
No, it's just questions.

05:57.906 --> 06:00.074
What do you think the role
of the government should be?

06:00.142 --> 06:02.443
Limited. I believe
in small government.

06:02.511 --> 06:04.512
- Excellent answer.
- Or no government at all.

06:04.580 --> 06:06.681
If it works in Antarctica,
why can't it work here?

06:06.748 --> 06:09.984
But if we have to have government,
make it as small as possible.

06:10.052 --> 06:13.687
Dwarves, tiny buildings...
Pizza bagels for lunch.

06:13.739 --> 06:15.790
Maybe we should stop
at small government.

06:15.858 --> 06:17.992
Let's cut to the chase.

06:18.060 --> 06:20.595
I need you to assure me you
would never allow the government

06:20.662 --> 06:23.364
to interfere with the sale
of one company to another.

06:23.432 --> 06:25.566
Of course not. The government
shouldn't interfere in anything!

06:25.634 --> 06:27.802
What happens inside
a man's own rain poncho

06:27.870 --> 06:29.870
at a minor league baseball
game is his own business.

06:29.922 --> 06:32.640
Well, Steve, we should stop
talking before I change my mind.

06:32.708 --> 06:34.475
But I do want to host
a fundraiser for you,

06:34.543 --> 06:35.843
so give me a couple of days
to put that together.

06:35.911 --> 06:39.113
I need to know that you
believe in my message, Jack.

06:39.181 --> 06:42.283
Take the rattle.

06:42.351 --> 06:46.254
Say "goo goo gaa gaa," Jack.

06:46.321 --> 06:49.190
Goo goo gaa gaa.

06:54.003 --> 06:55.437
What's going on here?

06:55.505 --> 06:58.306
I'm helping Tracy plan for
a Golden Globes event tomorrow.

06:58.374 --> 07:00.142
Kenneth is our
human Sushi platter,

07:00.209 --> 07:02.944
and I'm doing a dry run
so everything will be perfect...

07:03.012 --> 07:04.379
For my friend Tracy.

07:04.447 --> 07:07.149
Lying perfectly still
reminds me of hiding

07:07.216 --> 07:09.301
under our porch during
a hill people rampage.

07:09.368 --> 07:12.120
On the day, Kenneth's mouth
will be filled with wasabi

07:12.188 --> 07:14.556
so he don't do so much...

07:14.624 --> 07:17.125
I should get a chafing dish
and fill it with my underwear

07:17.193 --> 07:19.161
in case some Saudi guys
show up.

07:23.032 --> 07:24.533
Let me get this straight.

07:24.584 --> 07:26.334
You, the person who is
still jealous

07:26.402 --> 07:28.286
of the attention
baby Jessica got,

07:28.371 --> 07:32.174
are helping Tracy
win an award for acting?

07:32.241 --> 07:33.842
Oh, I'm helping him, all right.

07:33.910 --> 07:37.045
I even gave him the idea
to try to bribe them.

07:37.113 --> 07:39.214
And he's gonna do that?
That's awful.

07:39.282 --> 07:40.715
I trust award shows.

07:40.783 --> 07:42.984
They tell me how much to care
about different dead people.

07:43.052 --> 07:44.302
It's not gonna work.

07:44.387 --> 07:46.621
If they could be bribed,
I would have won a golden globe

07:46.689 --> 07:49.691
<i>for my lifetime original movie
sister, can you spare a breast?</i>

07:49.759 --> 07:52.027
So you've tried this before?

07:52.094 --> 07:56.932
And they were so offended,
they banned me for life.

07:56.999 --> 07:59.167
And the same thing
will happen to Tracy.

07:59.235 --> 08:00.836
So you're sabotaging him.

08:00.903 --> 08:02.537
Just like I did to my niece
when she tried to sing

08:02.605 --> 08:03.839
at our family's
Christmas party.

08:03.906 --> 08:06.475
You know what, you and Tracy
deserve each other.

08:06.542 --> 08:08.376
I don't know which of you
to be more disappointed in.

08:08.444 --> 08:09.678
Me, silly.

08:09.745 --> 08:11.129
I'm more aware
of what I'm doing.

08:16.819 --> 08:17.919
I'm sorry, miss.

08:17.987 --> 08:21.389
Do you know where
Liz Lemon... Good God!

08:21.457 --> 08:24.759
Lemon, those jeans make you look
like a Mexican sports reporter.

08:24.827 --> 08:27.028
Thank you, Jack. Hi.

08:27.096 --> 08:30.098
Do I know you from
outside the bagel store?

08:30.166 --> 08:31.333
You probably know me
from the future,

08:31.400 --> 08:33.400
where I am the president
of the United States.

08:33.469 --> 08:36.770
Steve Austin, Rhode Island's
independent candidate for congress.

08:36.839 --> 08:39.974
Oh, yeah, somebody forwarded
me one of your campaign ads.

08:40.025 --> 08:42.409
The rebirth of America
starts now.

08:42.477 --> 08:44.579
Waaaaah!

08:44.647 --> 08:46.748
My name is Steve Austin,
and if you're senile,

08:46.815 --> 08:49.401
yes, I am
the six-million dollar man!

08:49.468 --> 08:51.386
Paid for by the broken vending
machine at the paintball place.

08:51.454 --> 08:53.421
I'm actually working
with Steve's campaign,

08:53.489 --> 08:55.624
and I would like you to produce
a biographical video

08:55.691 --> 08:56.791
for a fundraiser I'm hosting.

08:56.859 --> 08:57.926
Oh, my God!

08:57.994 --> 08:59.494
I got a zappos box
coming today,

08:59.562 --> 09:00.629
and there's nobody there
to pick it up

09:00.696 --> 09:02.197
because my wife left me
for my twin brother.

09:02.265 --> 09:03.431
Can I use your phone?

09:03.499 --> 09:05.166
Yeah, okay.
You don't have a cell phone?

09:05.234 --> 09:06.568
Yeah, I got a cell phone.

09:06.636 --> 09:10.605
I walk around all day with a CIA
tracking device in my pocket.

09:13.009 --> 09:14.809
Okay, that guys is bananas.

09:14.861 --> 09:17.845
Obviously he should not be in
congress... What are you doing?

09:17.897 --> 09:20.749
He's running against
Regina Bookman... I need him.

09:20.816 --> 09:23.652
Aha. So you're putting
one more nut job...

09:23.719 --> 09:25.787
Yeah, I said it... "one more."
I'm political

09:25.854 --> 09:28.456
in Washington
so you can advance your career?

09:28.524 --> 09:29.558
What is going on today?

09:29.625 --> 09:31.359
Has everyone lost
their moral compass?

09:31.427 --> 09:32.994
You're being awfully
high and mighty

09:33.062 --> 09:35.463
for someone who once claimed
her husband drowned

09:35.531 --> 09:37.632
so she could get out
of a gym contract.

09:37.700 --> 09:40.068
The whole Kabletown deal
is resting on this,

09:40.136 --> 09:41.536
and Austin is pro-business.

09:41.604 --> 09:43.538
Big business is what's
screwing up this country.

09:43.589 --> 09:45.607
Please, Lemon, you work
for General Electric!

09:45.675 --> 09:47.309
Technically, I am a freelancer,

09:47.376 --> 09:49.644
which is pretty much
a modern-day cowboy.

09:49.712 --> 09:53.565
And I live like a cowboy by buying
quality, locally made jeans.

09:53.649 --> 09:57.269
Also by eating beans out of
a can due to impatience.

09:57.353 --> 09:58.687
You're on your own here,
partner.

09:58.754 --> 10:02.357
But hey, it's not all bad, 'cause
you get to watch me walk away.

10:07.863 --> 10:09.831
No, no, that's not right.

10:09.898 --> 10:12.334
Why can't the delivery guy
just leave it out back?

10:12.401 --> 10:16.471
Yeah, I know it's not a
house, but I sleep there.

10:16.539 --> 10:18.173
I'd like to thank
you all for coming.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.742
We've heard complaints about
the Sushi platter moving...

10:20.810 --> 10:22.143
We're working on it.

10:22.211 --> 10:23.645
I'm sorry.

10:23.713 --> 10:27.515
Tracy would be happy to take
any softball questions you have,

10:27.583 --> 10:31.152
like the following...
What films inspire you?

10:31.220 --> 10:33.054
Well, definitely
the foreign films.

10:33.122 --> 10:36.224
Like the political ones where you
think there'll be no boobies,

10:36.292 --> 10:38.310
then bam! Boobies.

10:38.394 --> 10:41.429
Tracy, what is an actor?

10:41.497 --> 10:45.066
I think the better question is,
<i>what isn't an actor?</i>

10:45.134 --> 10:49.037
A lamp. A couch.
That mirror.

10:49.105 --> 10:50.405
Or a hidden pistol.

10:50.473 --> 10:55.327
An actor...

10:55.411 --> 11:00.248
And now, amidst a day of
wonders, one wonder more.

11:00.316 --> 11:03.618
<i>A special voters-only screening
of Hard to Watch,</i>

11:03.686 --> 11:07.955
<i>based on the book Stone Cold
Bummer, by manipulate.</i>

11:11.761 --> 11:14.562
They call New York
the Big Apple.

11:14.630 --> 11:17.065
Never seemed that way to me.

11:17.133 --> 11:18.900
I used to have dreams.

11:18.968 --> 11:21.102
I was an all-city
running back,

11:21.170 --> 11:26.274
and I was gonna run out of here
to college, the suburbs.

11:26.325 --> 11:31.813
Now the only thing I use a
football for is as a toilet.

11:31.881 --> 11:34.482
Funny thing to happen
to a guy named "lucky."

11:37.453 --> 11:40.655
♪ ♪

11:40.723 --> 11:43.224
I am a constitutional
originalist,

11:43.292 --> 11:46.494
and I believe that our
founding fathers had it right.

11:46.562 --> 11:48.863
We need to get back
to their America.

11:48.931 --> 11:50.598
No paved roads.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.767
Rum used as an anesthetic.

11:52.835 --> 11:53.835
Legalized slavery.

11:53.903 --> 11:56.004
All right.
Some good pieces.

11:56.072 --> 11:57.505
Jack, you want to see
my hand gestures?

11:57.573 --> 11:59.507
I have you listen to me!

11:59.575 --> 12:01.860
Forceful conclusion.

12:01.944 --> 12:03.812
There's work to be done.

12:03.863 --> 12:05.914
Hand me that shovel so I can
dig a grave for her.

12:05.981 --> 12:07.348
Okay, let's cut.

12:07.400 --> 12:11.119
Sir, look at this
Bookman photo op.

12:11.187 --> 12:14.022
"Representative Bookman greets
young voters at Warwick mall."

12:14.090 --> 12:16.791
She's courting the youth vote.
That means she's desperate.

12:16.859 --> 12:18.193
My generation never votes.

12:18.260 --> 12:20.295
It interferes with talking
about ourselves all the time.

12:20.362 --> 12:22.464
She's running scared.
God, this could work.

12:22.531 --> 12:24.833
Now all I have to do is
whip Austin into shape.

12:24.884 --> 12:26.634
Hey, Jack,
just to have options,

12:26.702 --> 12:28.470
should we do
a couple takes with Binky?

12:28.537 --> 12:29.971
- Let's take five.
- Wow.

12:30.038 --> 12:31.923
You're really going ahead
with this.

12:32.007 --> 12:33.441
Lemon, I'm not about
to take criticism

12:33.509 --> 12:34.776
from someone wearing
that tee shirt.

12:34.844 --> 12:37.145
Hey, don't talk down
Brooklyn Without Limits.

12:37.212 --> 12:39.147
Stores like this are
saving the world.

12:39.215 --> 12:41.416
Really? You're gonna lecture
me about big business again?

12:41.484 --> 12:43.551
Do you know who owns
Brooklyn without limits?

12:43.619 --> 12:44.602
Brooklyn Zack.

12:44.687 --> 12:45.954
He throws pool parties
in dumpsters.

12:46.021 --> 12:47.889
Halliburton.
In the mid-'90s,

12:47.957 --> 12:49.157
they found themselves
with a surplus

12:49.225 --> 12:50.959
of canvas waterboarding hoods,

12:51.026 --> 12:53.094
so they had sweatshops make them
into messenger bags

12:53.162 --> 12:55.563
to sell to outer-borough
idiots.

12:55.631 --> 12:57.198
You don't know
what you're talking about.

12:57.249 --> 12:59.667
Handmade in USA.

12:59.735 --> 13:02.003
Your magic jeans are from BWL?

13:02.070 --> 13:04.739
Oh, Lemon,
it's not handmade in USA.

13:04.807 --> 13:07.175
<i>It's pronounced
hond-made in oosa.</i>

13:07.243 --> 13:10.145
The hond people are
a vietnamese slave tribe,

13:10.212 --> 13:12.147
and USA is their island prison.

13:12.214 --> 13:14.382
<i>They made your jeans.</i>

13:14.450 --> 13:16.451
You know how they get
the stitching so small?

13:16.519 --> 13:18.052
Orphans.

13:18.120 --> 13:19.687
No!
Brooklyn Zack is real.

13:19.755 --> 13:21.639
He just got back from Peru,
where he met a family

13:21.724 --> 13:23.558
that's been making hats
for 2,000 years.

13:23.626 --> 13:25.059
We all make our compromises.

13:25.127 --> 13:27.395
At least I'm doing it
for our company, for jobs.

13:27.463 --> 13:30.765
You're doing it for your ass!

13:32.268 --> 13:33.902
I don't believe you.

13:33.969 --> 13:35.770
The liberal media would have
told me about this.

13:35.838 --> 13:37.122
There's no such thing.

13:37.206 --> 13:39.107
<i>The New York times is owned
by  NYT incorporated,</i>

13:39.175 --> 13:40.909
which is owned by
Altheon Ballistic Dynamics,

13:40.976 --> 13:42.510
which is owned by
the Murdoch family,

13:42.578 --> 13:45.747
who are owned...
By Halliburton.

13:58.471 --> 13:59.704

13:59.772 --> 14:01.456
How can you work here?

14:01.541 --> 14:03.141
Do you know
who owns this place?

14:03.209 --> 14:04.910
Halliburton, bitch.
So what?

14:04.977 --> 14:06.144
But look at you!

14:06.212 --> 14:08.547
You're meticulously groomed,
and...

14:08.598 --> 14:10.482
and you turned a tie
into a belt.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.100
Oh, so gay men
can't be conservative?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.351
<i>You're so 'norant.
That's short for ignorant.</i>

14:13.419 --> 14:15.887
That's short for "ignorant."

14:15.938 --> 14:16.955
And who are you to judge?

14:17.023 --> 14:18.640
You're still wearing
those jeans.

14:18.724 --> 14:24.162
Ah...Che Guevara...
If only you knew what this place stood for.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.431
His great grandfather was
Domingo Halliburton.

14:34.941 --> 14:36.074
Wow!

14:36.142 --> 14:38.276
I haven't seen so many suits
since my trial.

14:38.344 --> 14:43.448
I have an idea. I know these
people, so let me do the talking.

14:43.516 --> 14:46.251
Oh, uh, Steve?

14:46.302 --> 14:47.719
Of course you know Ed Perlman.

14:47.786 --> 14:51.840
Perlman, isn't that last name Jew...

14:51.924 --> 14:53.091
New strategy.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.426
I'll raise the money,
and you stay in here

14:54.494 --> 14:56.428
and cultivate an aura
of mystery.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.263
Ooh, good idea.
Maybe I'll add to it

14:58.331 --> 15:00.966
by making some mysterious
sounds.

15:01.033 --> 15:05.604
- Oooooohhh... Yeeee-eeee...
- I love it.

15:05.671 --> 15:09.875
Oowwww...
I'll go to jail in Deshawn's place

15:09.942 --> 15:11.443
'cause he's my brother.

15:11.511 --> 15:12.777
Don't say nothin'.

15:12.845 --> 15:15.780
Sometimes you gotta do
the right thing...

15:15.848 --> 15:18.650
Even when the wrong thing is
a whole lot easier.

15:18.718 --> 15:22.754
Now let's just have one last
happy dinner together...

15:22.821 --> 15:24.489
As a family!

15:27.660 --> 15:29.227
Your mother exploded.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.775
I got them
right where I want them.

15:43.843 --> 15:46.411
Time to do a little
Golden Globe shopping.

15:46.479 --> 15:54.252
No, Tracy... That movie gave
me drunk-in-the-bathtub face.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.987
We need to talk.

15:56.055 --> 15:59.691
Thank you for coming.

15:59.742 --> 16:02.093
Well, you were right
about Brooklyn Without Limits.

16:02.161 --> 16:05.931
Crunchy on the outside,
right-wing nut job on the inside.

16:05.998 --> 16:07.766
Like Anne Coulter's underwear.

16:07.833 --> 16:09.167
But I see you're still
wearing the jeans.

16:09.235 --> 16:11.703
I know!
They look so good.

16:11.754 --> 16:14.506
And I'm skyping later with Carol,
and we like to dance together.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.208
And I want to do
this "back it up" move

16:16.275 --> 16:18.143
that I haven't been able
to pull off since high school.

16:18.211 --> 16:21.079
It's like...
♪ back it up, back it up ♪

16:21.147 --> 16:22.314
♪ and drop it like it's hot ♪

16:22.381 --> 16:23.481
♪ drop it like it's hot ♪

16:23.549 --> 16:25.267
♪ I will haunt your dreams ♪

16:25.351 --> 16:29.120
So fine, I'm selling out.
But so are you.

16:29.188 --> 16:31.489
No. I believe
in Steve Austin

16:31.557 --> 16:34.159
and his plan to put a casino
on the moon.

16:34.227 --> 16:36.027
Then I believe in Halliburton.

16:36.095 --> 16:39.331
Good. So neither of us
should feel guilty.

16:39.398 --> 16:40.932
We don't.

16:45.738 --> 16:49.040
Sabotage? But I'm the one
who does that to me.

16:49.108 --> 16:51.176
I know, Tracy.
It was wrong.

16:51.244 --> 16:54.179
But I couldn't go through with
it because I saw your movie.

16:54.247 --> 16:57.682
And I can't believe I'm saying
this, but you're great.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.451
Wait, great like good,

16:59.518 --> 17:01.786
or grate like the thing
I dropped my asthma inhaler down

17:01.854 --> 17:03.722
the other day?

17:03.789 --> 17:05.056
The first one, Tray.

17:05.124 --> 17:08.093
You are going to win.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.595
And when you do,
I'll be furious.

17:10.663 --> 17:13.231
Like waking up
next to Rob Schneider furious.

17:13.299 --> 17:15.099
But I don't care.

17:15.166 --> 17:17.234
It's like you said
in the movie...

17:17.303 --> 17:19.570
Sometimes you gotta do
the right thing,

17:19.638 --> 17:22.107
even when the wrong thing
would be a whole lot easier.

17:22.174 --> 17:23.540
No, don't say that.

17:23.608 --> 17:25.910
In real life,
you have to make compromises.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.829
No, Liz Lemon,
it's like the thing I said

17:27.913 --> 17:29.681
in another movie I made.

17:29.749 --> 17:32.250
Compromises are for
lesser souls.

17:32.318 --> 17:34.953
Die, werewolf zombie!

17:35.021 --> 17:38.456
So you two have decided
to do the right thing?

17:38.524 --> 17:40.625
Ugh! Fine!

17:40.693 --> 17:42.177
I'll go home and change!

17:42.261 --> 17:45.463
Take a last look, guys.

17:49.368 --> 17:53.138
- I would hit that.
- Too small.

17:53.205 --> 17:58.643
I believe we are all being held
in slavery by big government.

18:00.846 --> 18:03.615
Lesbian Mario brothers.

18:03.666 --> 18:04.649
I couldn't do it, Jack.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.251
I just couldn't support BWL.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.253
And I'd already thrown out
all my other jeans.

18:08.321 --> 18:10.555
That is the most unflattering
item of clothing

18:10.623 --> 18:12.490
I have ever seen you wear.

18:12.541 --> 18:16.161
And I'm including 2008's
turtleneck with smiley-face vest.

18:16.228 --> 18:17.712
But I feel good.
And not just because

18:17.797 --> 18:20.432
in my shorteralls
I found a bag of tastetations,

18:20.499 --> 18:21.900
a discontinued chocolate
hard candy,

18:21.967 --> 18:25.937
but because sometimes
you gotta do the right thing,

18:26.005 --> 18:29.708
even when the wrong thing
would be a whole lot easier.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.710
Die, werewolf zombie.

18:37.182 --> 18:40.085
Good God, Lemon!

18:40.152 --> 18:44.856
I will never allow
casinos on the moon!

18:44.907 --> 18:46.574
Thank you!

18:57.837 --> 19:00.271
- Steve?
- Friend or foe?

19:00.339 --> 19:02.974
You're the reason
everyone came here tonight.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.342
They need to hear you speak.

19:04.410 --> 19:06.845
In person.

19:06.912 --> 19:08.580
From the heart.

19:14.520 --> 19:18.056
Damn you, shorteralls!

19:18.124 --> 19:21.693
Americans are a simple
but powerful people,

19:21.761 --> 19:23.995
which is why I have written
a new national anthem.

19:24.063 --> 19:25.697
♪ Ooga booga big ♪

19:25.765 --> 19:26.965
♪ ooga booga strong ♪

19:27.032 --> 19:30.835
♪ I am going to sing
my ooga booga song ♪

19:30.903 --> 19:32.337
♪ ooga booga big ♪

19:32.405 --> 19:34.572
♪ ooga booga strong ♪

19:34.640 --> 19:38.576
Wow! That's worse than
the speech my grandpa made

19:38.644 --> 19:40.512
when my cousin married
a Japanese girl.

19:40.579 --> 19:42.914
As if that weren't enough,
Austin was mocked

19:42.982 --> 19:45.150
in Jay Leno's monologue
tonight.

19:45.217 --> 19:48.052
The kingmaker has spoken.
It's over.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.888
Bookman will be reelected.

19:49.955 --> 19:51.356
But you did the right thing.

19:51.424 --> 19:52.924
And at the end of the day,

19:52.992 --> 19:54.893
isn't that more important
than some merger?

19:54.960 --> 19:56.895
Letting morality get
in the way of making money...

19:56.962 --> 19:59.864
I might as well go
and be a teacher.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.032
I know what will cheer you up.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.700
Would you like some cake?

20:02.768 --> 20:04.502
Yeah.

20:04.570 --> 20:05.603
Cake boy!

20:13.078 --> 20:16.448
This has been
the best day of my life.

20:21.858 --> 20:24.560
I believe ketchup bottles
should be 500% larger.

20:24.628 --> 20:27.863
<i>We are all responsible
for heroes becoming terrible.</i>

20:27.931 --> 20:31.801
But what kind of jail are these
alien prisoners being held in?

20:31.868 --> 20:33.536
We should bring back slavery!

20:33.604 --> 20:36.872
And they're backed
by big corporations.

20:36.940 --> 20:40.142
Animals can govern themselves.

20:40.210 --> 20:43.229
Taken out of context.
It was exactly what I meant.

20:43.313 --> 20:49.685
As God is my witness, we will
build casinos on the moon!
