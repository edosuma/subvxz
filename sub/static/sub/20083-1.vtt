02:51.971 --> 02:56.032
There's something delicious about
writing the first words of a story.

02:56.876 --> 03:00.334
You can never quite tell
where they'll take you.

03:01.781 --> 03:03.408
Mine took me here.

03:10.456 --> 03:14.324
Looking back, the city and I
never much liked each other.

03:15.161 --> 03:17.823
An unmarried woman, after all,
was expected to behave in

03:17.964 --> 03:19.728
very particular ways.

03:19.866 --> 03:23.233
Which did not include traipsing
from publisher to publisher

03:23.369 --> 03:25.132
with a gaggle of friends.

03:29.576 --> 03:34.445
Now, listen to me,
you must not be afraid.

03:35.481 --> 03:37.312
And don't talk too much.

03:41.054 --> 03:45.821
Friends who, sadly, others were
not so keen to meet.

03:54.567 --> 03:58.025
I've been selling my drawings
for greeting cards, place cards,

03:58.171 --> 04:00.537
etcetera for seven years.

04:26.466 --> 04:29.128
Bunnies in jackets
with brass buttons.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.930
How ever do you imagine
such things?

04:31.070 --> 04:32.128
I don't imagine them.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.139
They're quite real.
They're my friends.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.835
Are you based the animal
characters on your friends?

04:37.977 --> 04:40.445
No, the animals are my friends.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.408
Before Peter Rabbit there was
Benjamin Bunny,

04:43.549 --> 04:45.710
and then Sir Isaac the Newt.

04:45.852 --> 04:47.615
I have their drawings as well,
if you'd like to see them.

04:47.754 --> 04:50.018
That won't be necessary.
Unfortunately, Miss Potter.

04:50.156 --> 04:54.616
It is 'Miss' Potter, is it not?
Yes. Of course. Silly of me.

04:54.761 --> 04:56.422
Unfortunately, the market for
children's books...

04:56.562 --> 04:58.621
Yes, of course.
I completely understand.

04:58.765 --> 05:01.131
It was silly of me,
with no experience of these...

05:01.267 --> 05:05.226
F. Warne and Company would like to
publish your little book, Miss Potter.

05:05.371 --> 05:07.532
But best not to get overly hopeful.

05:07.674 --> 05:10.837
I know publishing your book will
not sell a great number of copies,

05:10.977 --> 05:13.741
but I think we can turn
a small profit.

05:15.281 --> 05:21.117
My dear Mr Warne, well,
I'm pleased. Very pleased indeed.

05:21.254 --> 05:24.815
I shall do everything possible to
ensure that you've not made a mistake.

05:26.559 --> 05:28.720
Miss Wiggin, I believe we can go.

05:28.861 --> 05:32.126
Thank you very much indeed.
Messrs Warne, for your time.

05:32.265 --> 05:37.635
Our pleasure. My brother always
knows what he's doing.

05:39.572 --> 05:45.135
Oh, I'm quite particular about
book size and price,

05:45.278 --> 05:48.543
and I'd like to avoid that
dreadful Gothic typeface

05:48.681 --> 05:51.115
your children's books usually have.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.411
I'm sure everything will be
to your satisfaction.

05:55.154 --> 05:56.416
Miss Potter.

05:57.657 --> 05:58.817
Your...

06:00.960 --> 06:02.120
Of course.

06:02.762 --> 06:04.525
My portfolio.

06:06.766 --> 06:08.233
Come along, Peter.

06:19.579 --> 06:22.446
- Sir Isaac, the newt!
- You can't be serious, Fruing.

06:22.582 --> 06:24.709
- That book won't sell ten copies.
- Of course not!

06:24.851 --> 06:29.720
- However, the thought did occur to me...
- Norman!

06:29.856 --> 06:32.120
We promised our little brother
a project.

06:32.258 --> 06:34.624
If he makes a muck of it,
what will it matter?

06:34.761 --> 06:38.527
I think Miss Potter may turn out
to be a Godsend.

06:38.664 --> 06:40.222
Home, Miss Potter?

06:41.067 --> 06:45.231
No, Saunders.
Drive me through the park.

06:45.371 --> 06:46.429
Through all the parks.

06:46.572 --> 06:49.541
- I beg your pardon, Miss Potter?
- Drive!

06:50.276 --> 06:51.538
Walk on.

06:53.179 --> 06:54.646
We did it!

06:54.781 --> 06:57.807
Did you hear my heart?
It was a kettle drum.

06:57.950 --> 07:00.714
You see? We cannot stay
home all our lives.

07:00.853 --> 07:03.413
We must present ourselves
to the world.

07:03.556 --> 07:06.423
And we must look upon it
as an adventure.

07:23.876 --> 07:25.639
Faster, Saunders!

07:27.480 --> 07:30.916
- Faster, Saunders, if you please!
- No, Miss Beatrix. No!

07:31.050 --> 07:33.211
- Fast as you can, old boy.
- Go on!

07:39.459 --> 07:40.824
Oh, I say!

07:59.479 --> 08:00.639
Saunders.

08:10.656 --> 08:13.523
Beatrix, where have you been?
It's after four o'clock.

08:13.659 --> 08:16.321
I'm not a child. I can do things
without my mother's permission.

08:16.462 --> 08:18.726
I was hoping to use the carriage
myself this afternoon.

08:18.865 --> 08:19.832
Where were you?

08:19.966 --> 08:23.026
I took a drive.
With my friends.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.329
You don't have any friends.

08:50.463 --> 08:54.229
Yes, I do, Mother.
Every time I draw.

08:57.470 --> 09:00.337
Some of your paintings are
quite pretty, Beatrix,

09:00.473 --> 09:03.442
but I'm not going to deceive you
as your father does

09:03.576 --> 09:05.737
and call them great art.

09:15.655 --> 09:19.022
Well, my friend,
when I am a published author

09:19.158 --> 09:20.921
then we shall see.

09:38.277 --> 09:40.939
Beatrix, Bertram,
time for good nights.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.412
- I haven't finished yet.
- Come on, hurry up.

09:44.150 --> 09:46.812
- Bertram.
- There! I got him.

09:47.353 --> 09:49.719
- Bertram, you're barbaric.
- Come on, you two.

09:49.855 --> 09:51.720
Hurry up. Down you go.

09:53.559 --> 09:54.719
Slowly!

09:58.364 --> 10:01.731
Hurry, Rupert! It won't do t
be late to the 'Hydes'.

10:01.867 --> 10:04.028
Doesn't Mama look beautiful,
Beatrix?

10:04.170 --> 10:06.638
Being in a temper puts such
a rose into her cheeks.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.933
When you grow up, Beatrix,
and have to run a household,

10:09.075 --> 10:11.839
plan parties, keep a social calendar
and put up with a man

10:11.978 --> 10:13.639
who's never been introduced to a clock,

10:13.779 --> 10:16.043
your cheeks will glow too.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.109
Look at this ribbon.

10:18.250 --> 10:21.310
That's unsightly.
Change her into something decent.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.421
And give this nightdress away.

10:22.555 --> 10:24.523
Oh, this will never do.
I'm just all fingers and thumbs!

10:24.657 --> 10:28.218
You're impossible, Rupert!
We are so late.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.022
What have you drawn today, Beatrix?

10:30.162 --> 10:32.630
Benjamin Bunny having a rest.

10:32.765 --> 10:35.131
His ears are getting
better and better.

10:35.267 --> 10:39.226
This shading here is very good,
Beatrix.

10:40.072 --> 10:41.835
Say your good nights now, children.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.534
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, Beatrix.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.740
- Good night, Father.
- Good night, Beatrix.

10:46.879 --> 10:48.847
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, Bertram.

10:48.981 --> 10:49.913
Good night, Father.

10:50.049 --> 10:51.016
Now, hurry upstairs.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.710
- Come on, mustn't make Mama and Papa.
- later than they are.

10:53.853 --> 10:55.821
- Oh, children.
- What now?

10:55.955 --> 10:59.015
On my way home, I happened to
walke down Piccadilly.

10:59.158 --> 11:01.217
And what do you think
jumped into my pockets?

11:01.360 --> 11:05.626
Something very special for
the young entomologist.

11:06.766 --> 11:08.529
And something very suitable for
the young lady

11:08.668 --> 11:11.432
who's very soon to grow up
to run a fine home,

11:11.570 --> 11:12.628
just like her mother.

11:12.772 --> 11:15.639
- We'll open them upstairs. Come on.
- Thank you, Father.

11:16.575 --> 11:18.736
- Thank you, Father.
- Come on.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.513
- Late, late late!
- We are not late.

11:28.654 --> 11:30.417
We will never be invited
to the Hydes' again.

11:30.556 --> 11:32.922
Heaven's sake, Helen,
it's polite to be a little late.

11:33.059 --> 11:34.026
Now get in the carriage.

11:34.160 --> 11:37.425
This isn't polite late,
this is late, late.

11:40.166 --> 11:42.828
Right, wee ones,
one story and then bed.

11:42.968 --> 11:47.234
I want Beatrix to tell a story.
Hers are funny.

11:47.373 --> 11:50.433
Indeed they are, and I know exactly
what it'll be about.

11:50.576 --> 11:51.941
Tom Thumb and Hunker Munker.

11:52.078 --> 11:56.344
Precisely. Tom, Hunker,
are you ready to play in a story?

11:56.482 --> 11:58.211
Oh, yes. We're excellent actors.

11:58.350 --> 12:01.615
Well, we shall see about that.
This will be your test.

12:01.754 --> 12:03.016
Over there.

12:05.658 --> 12:10.425
Once upon a time, those two excellent
housekeepers, Lucinda and Jane,

12:10.563 --> 12:13.726
bought some shiny new porcelain
food which they set out

12:13.866 --> 12:16.528
on their perfectly appointed
dining room table.

12:16.669 --> 12:18.933
Then, they decided to go for a walk.

12:20.673 --> 12:24.131
Suddenly, there came a scuffling
noise from the kitchen.

12:24.276 --> 12:27.541
Tom Thumb and Hunker Munker crept out.

12:27.680 --> 12:31.411
The two mice saw that
the dining table was set for dinner.

12:31.550 --> 12:34.018
Tom Thumb leapt up and
took a big bite

12:34.153 --> 12:37.714
from the first plate
and broke his tooth.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.115
Who we expecting someone?

12:40.559 --> 12:42.026
That's my publishers.

12:42.862 --> 12:46.923
It's not a social call.
In fact, I'm rather dreading it.

12:47.066 --> 12:49.728
I wish you wouldn't invite
trades people in to the house.

12:49.869 --> 12:51.234
They carry dust.

12:51.771 --> 12:55.036
Well, next time,
I shall go to their office.

12:59.078 --> 13:00.943
Mr Norman Warne.

13:01.981 --> 13:03.141
Miss Potter.

13:03.449 --> 13:06.509
I hope you will forgive my intrusion
into your daily routine.

13:06.652 --> 13:07.619
I was expecting one of the...

13:07.753 --> 13:10.722
Ah, yes,
I am Harold and Fruing's brother.

13:10.856 --> 13:13.017
I've recently joined the firm
and they have done me

13:13.159 --> 13:15.627
the great honour of assigning
your book to me.

13:17.062 --> 13:20.725
Thank you. It was most gracious
of you to invite me to...

13:20.866 --> 13:22.424
- Tea.
- Yes, I would love some.

13:22.568 --> 13:24.729
Yes, thank you.
Lemon.

13:25.471 --> 13:26.631
Thank you.

13:32.478 --> 13:33.638
Extraordinary!

13:34.980 --> 13:36.140
Funny!

13:37.449 --> 13:39.917
Delightful and magical and
so beautifully drawn.

13:40.052 --> 13:42.714
I am utterly, utterly speechless.

13:43.455 --> 13:46.515
Perhaps we should discuss
our business, Mr Warne.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.321
I put your drawings aside with
the greatest reluctance.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.723
Your brother's letter makes
two proposals

13:53.866 --> 13:57.029
which I find quite unacceptable.

13:57.169 --> 14:00.332
First, they'd like the drawings
to be in colour.

14:00.472 --> 14:02.736
I'm adamant they be
in black and white.

14:02.875 --> 14:05.036
But Peter Rabbit's blue jacket
and the red radishes,

14:05.177 --> 14:08.237
Surely you would like your enchanting
drawings reproduced as they are?

14:08.380 --> 14:12.316
Well, of course I would prefer colour,
but colour will make the book cost

14:12.451 --> 14:15.909
far more than little rabbits
can afford. I'm adamant.

14:16.055 --> 14:18.717
Which brings us to
your brother's second point.

14:18.858 --> 14:22.419
They wish to reduce the number
of drawings by nearly a third.

14:22.561 --> 14:24.222
Totally unacceptable.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.831
Let me explain.
The idea of reducing the number

14:26.966 --> 14:29.127
of drawings was not my brother's
but my own.

14:29.268 --> 14:32.032
If we can reduce the number
to 31 precisely,

14:32.171 --> 14:34.435
then the illustrations for
the entire book could be printed

14:34.573 --> 14:37.838
on a single sheet of paper using
what we call the three-colour process,

14:37.977 --> 14:43.313
that you desire, and at a relatively
low level of cost. Yes?

14:45.150 --> 14:48.608
I've given your book a great deal
of attention, truly.

14:48.754 --> 14:50.813
I would like it to look
colourful on the shelf

14:50.956 --> 14:53.925
so that it stands out
from ordinary books.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.924
You have given it some thought.

14:56.061 --> 14:59.326
Which other books have you
supervised, Mr Warne?

14:59.465 --> 14:59.931
Personally?

15:00.065 --> 15:02.625
- Yes.
- This will be my first.

15:05.771 --> 15:08.638
Miss Potter, I have recently
informed my brothers and my mother

15:08.774 --> 15:12.039
that I am no longer content to
stay at home and play nursemaid

15:12.177 --> 15:13.439
solely because I am the youngest son.

15:13.579 --> 15:17.811
No. I would like a proper job,
working for my family's firm

15:17.950 --> 15:19.918
and they have assigned me you.

15:21.053 --> 15:22.816
Does that make things clearer?

15:23.555 --> 15:27.423
In other words,
you have no experience whatsoever,

15:27.559 --> 15:30.221
but because you've made
a nuisance of yourself,

15:30.362 --> 15:34.025
demanding a chance,
they've fobbed you off on me.

15:34.166 --> 15:37.727
Miss Potter, I know all too well
what my brothers intended,

15:37.870 --> 15:41.533
giving me your, your 'bunny book',
as they call it,

15:41.674 --> 15:45.440
but I find your book quite
enchanting, delightful,

15:45.577 --> 15:50.310
and if they intended to fob me off,
as you say, then we shall show them.

15:50.449 --> 15:53.111
We shall give them a bunny book
to conjure with,

15:53.252 --> 15:56.119
In colours, mixed to your
satisfaction in front of

15:56.255 --> 15:58.314
your very eyes at the printer.

15:58.457 --> 15:59.719
At the printer?

15:59.858 --> 16:01.223
Oh, I could never.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.521
I will escort you there myself.

16:04.063 --> 16:06.429
If you will allow me the the honour.

16:06.865 --> 16:08.127
Why would I never?

16:08.267 --> 16:10.326
Of course I'll go.
I'm a grown woman.

16:10.469 --> 16:11.936
Miss Wiggin will be there.

16:12.071 --> 16:16.030
I see absolutely no reason why
an artist shouldn't visit her printer.

16:16.175 --> 16:17.836
Excellent, Miss Potter.

16:18.677 --> 16:20.941
Jolly good. Thank you.

16:21.580 --> 16:24.105
I shall make all the arrangements,
and I am, in every way,

16:24.249 --> 16:26.615
my dear lady, at your service.

16:28.654 --> 16:31.919
You and rabbits, extraordinary.
Excuse me.

16:35.861 --> 16:38.523
Johnson, come and get
the charms, would you?

16:39.264 --> 16:41.732
- Slowly, slowly. Put it there.
- I will be careful, ma'am.

16:42.768 --> 16:46.932
One, two, three... ten.

16:48.374 --> 16:51.343
When I was ten, my mother badgered
my father into spending the summer

16:51.477 --> 16:54.935
in the Lake District,
as did other fashionable families.

16:56.081 --> 16:59.915
Like an animal released from its cage,
I fell under its spell.

17:02.054 --> 17:05.512
Mind your frocks now.
Come here!

17:06.258 --> 17:09.421
The woods are full of fairies
and little folk that look for

17:09.560 --> 17:11.529
children that get their
clothes dirty.

17:11.663 --> 17:15.827
And when they find them,
they send the fairy beasts at night,

17:15.968 --> 17:18.936
with sharp teeth and a ready
appetite for young flesh.

17:19.070 --> 17:21.436
- I'm coming to get you, Bea!
- No

17:38.857 --> 17:40.017
Yes!

17:46.665 --> 17:47.927
Bertram. Bertram!

17:48.067 --> 17:52.128
Don't! They're farmers' children.
Their hands. Germs. Come on.

17:52.271 --> 17:53.738
Bertram! Bertram!

18:13.258 --> 18:14.623
Catch him, Bea!

18:18.363 --> 18:19.421
There he is!

18:19.565 --> 18:20.725
Oh, yes!

18:25.571 --> 18:26.936
Out of the way!

18:31.577 --> 18:32.737
There!

18:39.451 --> 18:40.713
There he is.

18:59.771 --> 19:02.239
I don't think a thrashing
will be necessary.

19:02.374 --> 19:05.241
I'll just leave the window
in the nursery unlatched tonight.

19:05.377 --> 19:07.242
The fairy beasts will
take care of the rest.

19:07.379 --> 19:09.142
No! I'll stay clean!

19:09.281 --> 19:10.407
Bertram.

19:11.950 --> 19:14.714
Really, Beatrix, What young man
is ever going to marry a girl

19:14.853 --> 19:16.115
with a faceful of mud?

19:16.255 --> 19:17.813
Well, I shan't marry,
so it doesn't matter.

19:17.956 --> 19:19.423
Of course you shall marry.

19:19.558 --> 19:23.119
All girls marry. I did.
Your grandmother did.

19:23.262 --> 19:25.822
Even Fiona will one day.

19:25.964 --> 19:29.923
- Well, I shan't. I shall draw.
- Oh, those silly drawings.

19:30.068 --> 19:31.330
Then who will love you?

19:31.470 --> 19:35.133
My art and my animals.
I won't need more love than that.

19:35.274 --> 19:39.335
Perhaps not at 11, but let's see
if you still feel the same way at 18.

19:39.478 --> 19:43.039
I drew Mama when we first met
and she married me.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.412
And, Fiona, doesn't mud wash off?

19:45.551 --> 19:47.018
Bertram, come along.

19:51.757 --> 19:53.622
Die, you little devil!

19:54.259 --> 19:56.819
Right. Prince Charming himself
couldn't resist

19:56.962 --> 19:58.224
such a bonny, wee girl.

19:58.363 --> 20:01.526
Not when he meets my brother,
Vlad the Impaler.

20:01.667 --> 20:04.932
- Got you!
- Bedtime my young reprobates.

20:05.671 --> 20:08.936
Now, shall I leave a window
open, or?

20:09.074 --> 20:11.440
No! I don't like fairy beasts.

20:11.577 --> 20:14.444
Well, it is a well-known fact that
fairy beasts never eat a child

20:14.580 --> 20:16.605
when he's tucked up in his own bed.

20:17.649 --> 20:20.413
The fairies have been
in the north country

20:20.552 --> 20:23.612
for hundreds of years,
and have had many adventures.

20:24.356 --> 20:26.517
I told you about you
a changingly child?

20:26.658 --> 20:27.317
No.

20:27.459 --> 20:29.324
Yes, several times.

20:29.461 --> 20:31.622
I want to hear it.

20:31.763 --> 20:34.926
Oh, go ahead, Fiona.
I'll tell myself a story.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.227
Right.

20:37.769 --> 20:41.227
Once upon a time,
there was a king and a queen.

20:41.373 --> 20:44.740
Once upon a time,
there were four little rabbits.

20:44.876 --> 20:48.744
Their names were...
Flopsy, Mopsy...

20:48.880 --> 20:51.314
Cotton-tail and Peter.

20:51.450 --> 20:54.817
'Now, my dears,
said old Mrs Rabbit one morning,

20:54.953 --> 20:57.717
'you may go into the fields
or down the lane,

20:57.856 --> 21:01.223
'but don't go into
Mr McGregor's garden.'

21:01.360 --> 21:02.622
'Why not, Mother?'

21:02.761 --> 21:06.629
'Because your father had
an accident there.

21:06.765 --> 21:10.633
He was put in a pie
by Mrs McGregor.'

21:12.571 --> 21:16.132
Peter, who was very naughty,
ran straightaway to

21:16.275 --> 21:17.435
Mr McGregor's garden,

21:17.576 --> 21:20.238
and squeezed under the gate.

21:21.480 --> 21:22.640
I like it.

21:35.861 --> 21:38.125
But round the end of
the cucumber frame,

21:38.263 --> 21:41.926
whom should he meet,
but Mr McGregor!

21:42.067 --> 21:44.433
Peter was out of breath and
trembling with fright,

21:44.569 --> 21:46.628
and he had not the least idea
which way to go.

21:46.772 --> 21:49.240
- It's muddy, actually.
- One more, Mr Mortimer.

21:49.374 --> 21:50.238
Lighten it up.

21:50.375 --> 21:52.536
Mr McGregor caught sight of him
at the corner,

21:52.678 --> 21:54.236
but Peter did not care.

21:54.379 --> 21:57.815
He slipped underneath the gate
and was safe at last

21:57.949 --> 21:59.610
in the wood outside.

21:59.751 --> 22:05.121
Not quite. See here?
It's still a bit...

22:12.264 --> 22:14.824
When Peter came home
his mother put him to bed

22:14.966 --> 22:17.730
with a tablespoonful of camomile tea.

22:17.869 --> 22:23.034
But Flopsy, Mopsy and Cotton-tail
had bread and milk

22:23.175 --> 22:25.336
and blackberries for supper.

22:30.349 --> 22:34.308
This book, it's changed things
for me, Mr Warne.

22:34.453 --> 22:35.613
How so?

22:38.657 --> 22:41.922
For one thing, it's given me
the chance to prove to my mother

22:42.060 --> 22:47.521
that an unmarried woman of 32 can
do more than attend tea parties

22:47.666 --> 22:51.124
- and smile at dull conversations.
- Yes, indeed.

22:51.269 --> 22:54.432
You know, my family never wanted me
to get into publishing either.

22:54.573 --> 22:56.837
We do make rather a good team,
don't you think?

22:59.978 --> 23:02.742
Provided, of course,
we prove them wrong.

23:13.959 --> 23:16.723
Mother, this is Miss Potter.

23:17.963 --> 23:22.423
At last, we poor forgotten folk
in Bedford Square get to share

23:22.567 --> 23:24.228
some of Norman's excitement.

23:24.369 --> 23:27.031
Mrs Warne, it's so kind of you
to invite me.

23:27.172 --> 23:30.733
Nonsense. It was the desperate
act of a woman who was beginning

23:30.876 --> 23:32.138
to forget what her son looked like.

23:32.277 --> 23:34.541
Mother!
And this is my sister, Amelia.

23:34.679 --> 23:35.646
Hello.

23:35.781 --> 23:37.806
Norman allowed us a peek at
Peter Rabbit, Miss Potter.

23:37.949 --> 23:40.509
We found it utterly charming.
So we wheedled, cajoled,

23:40.652 --> 23:43.712
and absolutely insisted that
Norman bring you round for tea.

23:43.855 --> 23:46.915
I have decided that you and I
are going to be friends.

23:47.659 --> 23:48.819
Have you?

23:49.261 --> 23:53.425
Well, Norman tells me that
you're unmarried, as am I,

23:53.565 --> 23:54.930
and that you're not
unhappy about it.

23:55.066 --> 23:56.931
And I can't tell you how much
that pleases me.

23:57.068 --> 23:59.628
Why can't you talk about
the weather like other girls?

23:59.771 --> 24:02.433
Well, all the other unmarried
daughters in our circle,

24:02.574 --> 24:04.132
and, believe me, there are many
they sit around all day,

24:04.276 --> 24:07.143
gossiping and unaccountably
bursting into tears.

24:07.279 --> 24:10.908
But you have done something.
You've written a book.

24:11.550 --> 24:14.815
I warn you, I am prepared to
like you very much.

24:14.953 --> 24:17.513
Well, in that case, I shall have
to like you too, Miss Warne.

24:17.656 --> 24:19.920
Call me Millie, and that's to be
the last of Miss Potter too,

24:20.058 --> 24:20.422
I'm afraid.

24:20.559 --> 24:22.925
Absolutely. Beatrix, by all means.

24:23.061 --> 24:25.723
Thank goodness, the tea!
I'm beginning to feel quite ill

24:25.864 --> 24:27.126
with all this bonhomie.

24:27.265 --> 24:28.630
Oh, do let's have tea
in the garden, Mother.

24:28.767 --> 24:30.826
It's too beautiful a day
in every way not to share it

24:30.969 --> 24:32.334
with the flowers.

24:35.173 --> 24:37.334
Well, I love to garden.
Mother disapproves,

24:37.476 --> 24:39.842
but I can't help myself.
I love flowers shockingly.

24:39.978 --> 24:42.037
That's why you have
the hands of a greengrocer.

24:42.180 --> 24:43.238
I do not!

24:43.348 --> 24:46.806
Thank heavens Norman sometimes
deigns to read to me.

24:46.952 --> 24:48.715
If I had to rely on you
for companionship,

24:48.854 --> 24:50.617
I should expire of loneliness.

24:50.755 --> 24:52.916
My mother's taste in books,
Miss Potter, and, I'm afraid,

24:53.058 --> 24:55.618
in life, runs to the er...
melodramatic.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.421
Oh, nonsense.

24:57.562 --> 25:00.929
I like good English biographies
and you know it.

25:01.066 --> 25:04.331
I loathe silly romances, such as
the ones your brothers publish.

25:04.469 --> 25:06.027
My brothers and I, Mother.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.139
I am part of the firm now too,
you know.

25:08.273 --> 25:11.640
A sweet-natured boy like you
does not need to work.

25:11.776 --> 25:13.835
Your brothers provide quite well
for all of us,

25:13.979 --> 25:16.345
and I need your smile here.

25:17.048 --> 25:19.312
But then, no-one listens to
a crotchety old lady

25:19.451 --> 25:20.110
in a wheelchair.

25:20.252 --> 25:21.810
Indeed they don't, Mother.

25:21.953 --> 25:23.420
My mother may be crotchety,
Miss Potter,

25:23.555 --> 25:25.523
but she does have an eye
for beautiful things.

25:25.657 --> 25:27.818
She was fascinated by your drawings.

25:29.261 --> 25:31.320
Utterly unique.

25:32.864 --> 25:36.732
Well, when I see something unusual,
I'm not content just to look at it.

25:36.868 --> 25:38.927
I must capture it.

25:39.471 --> 25:42.338
Last summer, in the farmyard,
I was drawing something

25:42.474 --> 25:44.942
that was quite lovely in the sun,

25:45.076 --> 25:49.240
and suddenly, I realised I was
drawing the pigs' swill bucket.

25:49.781 --> 25:51.612
I had to laugh at myself.

25:53.351 --> 25:55.911
I feel a bit of a chill, Norman.
Can you take me inside?

25:56.054 --> 25:57.521
- Of course.
- Please excuse me.

25:57.656 --> 26:00.022
It was delightful meeting you,
Miss Potter.

26:00.158 --> 26:00.920
And you.

26:01.059 --> 26:05.621
Do stay longer, and teach
Millie how to behave.

26:06.665 --> 26:08.929
I think that means she likes you.

26:10.068 --> 26:13.435
Did she say she likes to
draw swill buckets?

26:13.572 --> 26:17.235
Indeed she did, Mother.
Indeed she did.

26:17.976 --> 26:21.343
I think by Wednesday, you could
hang the lace curtains upstairs.

26:21.479 --> 26:25.609
- Then at least it will look like summer,
even if it doesn't feel like it. -Yes, Madam

26:25.750 --> 26:28.810
Oh, Beatrix. What is this stain
on your blouse?

26:28.954 --> 26:31.013
Jane says it won't wash out,
and she's tried everything.

26:31.156 --> 26:33.215
- Oh, it's ink.
- Ink?

26:33.358 --> 26:36.122
I must have brushed against
something at the printers'.

26:36.261 --> 26:39.025
Jane, I'm very sorry for causing
you extra work.

26:39.164 --> 26:42.133
Jane, take the blouse away.
Give it to the poor.

26:42.267 --> 26:45.236
This behaviour shows scant
regard for your father's money.

26:45.370 --> 26:49.431
Well, one day, I shall make enough
money to buy my own clothes.

26:49.574 --> 26:52.441
I'm far too old to be living off
the generosity of my father.

26:52.577 --> 26:54.044
You're too old to be
spending so much time

26:54.179 --> 26:56.613
in the company of a man
who takes you to printers!

26:56.748 --> 27:00.013
Your father does not approve,
and neither do I.

27:00.151 --> 27:02.415
Mr Warne is publishing my book.

27:02.554 --> 27:07.218
Oh, that book! I can hardly wait
till it's finished and forgotten.

27:07.359 --> 27:09.122
I don't understand you, Beatrix.

27:09.260 --> 27:12.229
Your father and I have introduced
you to so many suitable young men

27:12.364 --> 27:16.027
of your class, young men of fortune,
and impeccably good family.

27:16.167 --> 27:20.536
Oh, certainly, like that charming
fellow, Lionel Stokely.

27:21.072 --> 27:24.439
Lionel is a particular favourite
of his uncle, the earl,

27:24.576 --> 27:27.238
whom we visit every summer
at Stokely Court.

27:27.379 --> 27:31.110
Oh, and I do regret terribly that
I didn't accept Harry Haddon-Bell.

27:31.249 --> 27:33.308
Harry's great-grandfather
went to Sandhurst.

27:33.451 --> 27:35.214
Harry's grandfather
went to Sandhurst.

27:35.353 --> 27:37.321
Harry's father
went to Sandhurst.

27:37.455 --> 27:40.322
And so I went to Sandhurst.

27:40.458 --> 27:44.827
Father and I and the gamekeeper often
go out riding in the morning...

27:44.963 --> 27:47.124
Ashton's a crack shot.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.533
But no, you're just
a pig-headed girl.

27:50.669 --> 27:53.137
Mr Warne is asking for you
at the door, Miss.

27:53.271 --> 27:56.536
Mr Warne? He's not expected.

27:56.675 --> 27:59.143
Unannounced. Perfection!

28:19.064 --> 28:20.224
Come on, here.

28:25.670 --> 28:27.638
Two sold while we were
at the booksellers.

28:27.772 --> 28:30.036
That amounts to 40 in a week.

28:30.175 --> 28:32.143
- Which is 160 in a month.
- Good gracious!

28:32.277 --> 28:35.041
I'm trying to remember
my twelve-times table.

28:36.281 --> 28:39.011
1,920 in a year.

28:39.551 --> 28:42.019
- I can't breathe.
- That's just in one shop.

28:42.153 --> 28:44.917
My dear Miss Potter,
you are an author.

28:45.256 --> 28:46.917
We have achieved
what we set out to do.

28:47.058 --> 28:49.117
We have created a book.

28:50.261 --> 28:51.421
Yes.

28:52.464 --> 28:53.624
What's the matter?

28:54.466 --> 28:56.627
A cloud just passed across your face.

28:58.670 --> 29:01.935
You've been very generous
with your time, Mr Warne,

29:02.073 --> 29:05.736
Shown me things that
I never would have seen.

29:05.877 --> 29:07.435
Printing houses!

29:08.379 --> 29:12.509
- I shall miss your company.
- Are you losing my company?

29:13.651 --> 29:16.415
It just occurred to me
that the book is out

29:16.554 --> 29:19.921
and our association is
coming to an end.

29:20.058 --> 29:21.218
Miss Potter.

29:23.061 --> 29:27.020
I had hoped that you might
have other stories.

29:27.165 --> 29:28.325
Really?

29:29.267 --> 29:30.427
Really?

29:31.469 --> 29:36.236
Do you know, I recently remembered
one I thought I had forgotten it.

29:36.374 --> 29:37.534
About a duck...

29:38.977 --> 29:41.138
a very stupid duck.

29:41.279 --> 29:42.940
Based on one of your friends?

29:43.348 --> 29:46.112
It's based on myself, I think

29:46.251 --> 29:48.617
It's a story I told a friend once.

29:50.355 --> 29:53.722
My family summers in the Lake District,
and there was someone there,

29:53.858 --> 29:57.726
the grounds man's son, who was
always interested in my stories.

30:03.168 --> 30:05.932
Miss Beatrix. Are you skulking?

30:06.070 --> 30:10.734
No such thing, Willie Heelis. No.
I was drying off my sketch book.

30:15.780 --> 30:17.805
Not bad, Miss Beatrix.

30:19.050 --> 30:21.109
Do you have any animal
stories for me today?

30:21.252 --> 30:23.914
I don't. Sorry. Nothing new.

30:26.257 --> 30:29.226
That's Jemima.
She doesn't have a story yet.

30:29.360 --> 30:30.827
Not a proper one.

30:30.962 --> 30:34.125
- Jemima Duck?
- Jemima Puddle-Duck.

30:34.265 --> 30:37.234
And a stupider duck
the world has never seen.

30:38.269 --> 30:41.033
She goes looking for a safe
place to lay her eggs

30:41.172 --> 30:43.732
and meets a charming gentleman
with a long bushy tail

30:43.875 --> 30:46.139
and very sharp teeth.

30:48.179 --> 30:49.737
Precisely.

30:49.881 --> 30:53.612
The gentlemen offers her his shed
and Jemima is surprised to find

30:53.751 --> 30:55.514
that there are so many feathers in it.

30:55.653 --> 30:59.214
But then, as I told you,
she is a very stupid duck.

30:59.757 --> 31:00.917
I like it.

31:03.661 --> 31:06.129
I'd love to paint every view
in this valley,

31:06.264 --> 31:08.528
but I'm not very good at landscapes.

31:08.666 --> 31:11.430
Wait too long and it won't be
here to paint, Miss Beatrix.

31:11.569 --> 31:14.834
- Really, that's ridiculous.
- No, I'm serious.

31:14.973 --> 31:18.431
The large farms are being broken up
into small plots and sold off.

31:18.576 --> 31:21.841
Well, you can't stand
in the way of progress.

31:21.980 --> 31:23.242
So they say.

31:24.249 --> 31:27.810
But I say beauty's
worth preserving.

31:27.952 --> 31:29.317
I know you do, Willie.

31:29.454 --> 31:32.218
But nobody could disagree
with you about that.

31:33.958 --> 31:35.926
Well, I'll see you soon, then.

31:36.060 --> 31:39.723
Perhaps not, Miss Beatrix.
I'm leaving for Manchester next week.

31:40.164 --> 31:41.927
To study the law?

31:42.066 --> 31:45.126
Yes, indeed. I have to better
myself somehow.

31:45.570 --> 31:48.437
- Good luck.
- Send me some drawings.

31:48.573 --> 31:49.733
I will.

31:52.977 --> 31:55.639
He encouraged me to take
my writing seriously.

31:55.780 --> 31:58.010
We must get started on
the new story straight away.

31:58.149 --> 32:00.709
Jemima Puddle-Duck.
I think the public should like that,

32:00.852 --> 32:03.320
and Tom Thumb and Hunker Munker.
What do you think?

32:03.454 --> 32:04.819
Well, if you, if you think.

32:04.956 --> 32:07.015
Your book has been very
important in my life.

32:07.158 --> 32:09.422
You have been very
important in my life.

32:09.560 --> 32:10.925
And you in mine, Mr Warne.

32:11.062 --> 32:14.122
- And we must do it again and again.
- And again!

32:14.265 --> 32:16.825
I promise you,
I intend to be a nuisance.

32:40.058 --> 32:42.219
When did you decide
you wouldn't marry?

32:42.860 --> 32:44.919
Just before my 20th birthday.

32:45.063 --> 32:48.624
Mother came to my room and
announced that Lionel Stokely

32:48.766 --> 32:51.929
was to marry Gwendolyn Alcott and
they were to live at Stokely Court,

32:52.070 --> 32:54.834
which Lionel had just
inherited from the earl.

32:55.473 --> 32:59.341
And I knew right then that
she would bring me no more suitors

32:59.477 --> 33:01.342
and that I would never marry.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.913
And that shocked me.

33:05.350 --> 33:07.318
But I felt relieved.

33:08.252 --> 33:09.913
And that shocked me.

33:10.755 --> 33:15.021
So I went into the garden and filled
an entire notebook with sketches.

33:15.560 --> 33:16.720
Men are bores.

33:16.861 --> 33:18.726
They're useful for only
two things in life

33:18.863 --> 33:21.423
financial support and procreation.

33:21.566 --> 33:25.434
Millie!
You say outrageous things!

33:27.572 --> 33:30.939
- Ah, but the price.
- What price?

33:31.075 --> 33:35.739
Domestic enslavement.
Childbirth. Terrifying.

33:35.880 --> 33:37.814
No, unmarried women have
a better life.

33:37.949 --> 33:39.712
I swear it's true.

33:39.851 --> 33:44.413
No houses, no babies, no husbands
demanding things all the time.

33:44.555 --> 33:47.115
As long as one's lucky enough
in life to have a good friend.

33:47.258 --> 33:50.022
I'm so glad Norman found you, Beatrix.

33:50.161 --> 33:52.629
I was missing something
I didn't even know.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.846
Dear Miss Potter,
I enclose with great pleasure

34:08.980 --> 34:12.005
the latest in what I hope
will be a long line of tales.

34:12.150 --> 34:14.208
Yours affably, Norman Warne.

34:14.351 --> 34:15.717
Mr Warne.

34:15.853 --> 34:18.913
Would you and Millie like to
come to a Christmas party?

34:19.056 --> 34:20.614
My parents hold one every year,

34:20.757 --> 34:24.023
and I think it's high time
that I invited someone.

34:24.161 --> 34:28.223
Yes, we'd be delighted to attend.
Thrilled, in fact.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.905
Be still, little imps!

34:45.049 --> 34:47.108
Peter, you naughty boy!

34:47.251 --> 34:49.411
Look what an example you're setting.

34:52.456 --> 34:56.416
That's better. Any more of that
and I'll paint you out.

34:58.262 --> 35:00.321
Your father is home.

35:06.270 --> 35:08.135
How was your day at the club, Father?

35:09.173 --> 35:10.731
Interesting, as always.

35:10.875 --> 35:13.742
Rupert, we seem to have a situation.
We need your resolution.

35:13.878 --> 35:16.904
I want to invite Norman Warne and
his sister to our Christmas party.

35:17.048 --> 35:19.608
With Lady Armitage?
With Sir Nigel and Sybil?

35:19.750 --> 35:22.810
A tradesman, Rupert!
How will anyone have fun?

35:22.954 --> 35:25.923
He's the gentleman
who publishes my books, Father.

35:28.459 --> 35:31.326
- Rupert.
- I have something here, Beatrix.

35:32.663 --> 35:37.225
I went into Hatchards bookshop and
I purchased this with good money.

35:37.368 --> 35:40.633
Hugh Whitteford bearded me in
the club and rattled on for hours.

35:40.771 --> 35:42.830
You know old Hugh, jowls all aflutter.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.339
Wife's bought three of
your girls' books

35:44.475 --> 35:45.737
for her granddaughter's nursery.

35:45.877 --> 35:47.936
Sending more by ship
to chums in Bombay.

35:48.079 --> 35:50.707
Very soon, the whole club was
telling me of some purchase

35:50.848 --> 35:53.817
that they had made of
our daughter's creation.

35:53.951 --> 35:55.714
So I thought it was time
that I bought one.

35:55.853 --> 35:59.220
So I went straight into Hatchards,
put my shilling onto the counter.

35:59.357 --> 36:00.324
I would have given you one.

36:00.458 --> 36:04.019
But I wanted to buy one
like everyone else.

36:04.762 --> 36:07.230
Now, I owe you an apology, Beatrix.

36:07.865 --> 36:11.130
When you showed me your books,
all I saw was my little girl

36:11.269 --> 36:14.432
bringing me clever drawings
for me to comment on.

36:15.072 --> 36:19.236
You're not a little girl anymore.
You're an artist.

36:19.377 --> 36:21.038
The genuine article.

36:21.679 --> 36:25.308
I would have been proud to use
that word about myself,

36:25.449 --> 36:28.009
and now, I'm proud of you, Beatrix.

36:28.152 --> 36:29.517
Thank you, Father.

36:29.654 --> 36:33.715
So I don't see any reason why
we cannot make a little social effort

36:33.858 --> 36:38.420
to welcome the gentleman responsible
for this blessing into our home.

36:38.763 --> 36:40.025
Thank you, Father.

36:42.066 --> 36:43.226
Thank you.

36:44.769 --> 36:47.033
I think it will be good
for all of us.

36:51.676 --> 36:53.541
Merry Christmas, Rupert.

37:00.351 --> 37:03.320
Glenys, don't serve Sir Nigel
the punch with brandy

37:03.454 --> 37:05.012
- unless he demands it.
- Yes, madam.

37:05.156 --> 37:07.420
And after dinner, he'll take port.

37:07.558 --> 37:10.925
Come and give me a little signal
after he's had four glasses.

37:12.163 --> 37:15.724
The house shimmers, my darling.
You've done it again.

37:17.969 --> 37:19.732
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

37:19.870 --> 37:23.931
- Mr Warne, Millie,
- how wonderful!

37:24.075 --> 37:25.235
Thank you, Jane.

37:26.477 --> 37:27.637
Thank you. Thank you.

37:32.350 --> 37:35.319
Mother, Father,
I would like you to meet

37:35.453 --> 37:39.014
Miss Amelia and Mr Norman Warne.

37:39.156 --> 37:42.319
How charming of you
to be so punctual!

38:02.580 --> 38:04.605
Go on, one wouldn't hurt.

38:06.150 --> 38:09.813
I think Wiggin is under strict
orders never to leave our side.

38:09.954 --> 38:11.512
How festive!

38:40.551 --> 38:42.519
Such scintillating conversation.

38:42.653 --> 38:46.316
Oh, mine as well! The weather
in Amsterdam in July.

38:46.457 --> 38:49.517
Could I interest you ladies
in an after dinner coffee?

38:49.660 --> 38:52.220
Some of the gentlemen would like
to play a few hands of cards,

38:52.363 --> 38:53.830
but they're short of a fourth.

38:53.964 --> 38:55.727
I don't suppose you play whist,
Mr Warne?

38:55.866 --> 38:58.027
I'm afraid I've never had
much aptitude for cards.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.831
- Oh, that is a pity.
- I play.

39:00.971 --> 39:02.836
This is to play with Sir Nigel,
Miss Warne.

39:02.973 --> 39:04.941
Sir Nigel takes his whist
very seriously.

39:05.076 --> 39:07.044
I play rather well, actually.

39:07.478 --> 39:08.740
Do you, Millie?

39:09.880 --> 39:13.213
Well, I'm sure you two have
plenty to talk about without me,

39:13.351 --> 39:15.410
and if they can't play
without a fourth...

39:16.554 --> 39:18.215
Come along, Miss Warne.

39:20.758 --> 39:23.022
Carols in the music room, my dears.

39:25.363 --> 39:28.332
Perhaps I could show you
your Christmas present.

39:28.466 --> 39:29.433
Yes.

39:29.567 --> 39:31.228
It's upstairs.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.836
I will bring the coffee.

39:50.454 --> 39:52.422
- Mrs Wiggin.
- Miss.

39:52.556 --> 39:54.615
Miss Wiggin. I have taken
the liberty of adding

39:54.759 --> 39:57.023
a splash of brandy to our coffees.

39:57.161 --> 39:58.719
Well, it is Christmas.

40:00.464 --> 40:02.728
Is this where you paint, Miss Potter?

40:02.867 --> 40:07.031
Yes, and it's where we shall
find your Christmas present.

40:10.374 --> 40:12.342
Oh, my!

40:12.977 --> 40:15.343
I think, other than Bertram and Father,
you are the first man ever

40:15.479 --> 40:16.343
to set foot in this room.

40:16.480 --> 40:19.108
- Would you like me to leave?
- No, no, no. Wiggin is here.

40:19.250 --> 40:22.219
And if this is the best I can do
for scandal at my age,

40:22.353 --> 40:25.413
I'm hardly worthy of my reputation
for creativity.

40:26.457 --> 40:27.617
Here.

40:29.860 --> 40:31.623
My, but it's beautiful!

40:32.663 --> 40:34.028
Is it the new story?

40:34.565 --> 40:36.829
Miss Potter, is it the new story?

40:36.967 --> 40:39.128
- Is it?
- I'm not going to tell you.

40:40.271 --> 40:41.431
Come over here.

40:42.573 --> 40:44.336
That's Jemima Puddle-Duck.

40:44.475 --> 40:49.037
It's the first drawing I ever did
of Jemima. I was eight, I think.

40:49.180 --> 40:50.807
Jemima, stop that!

40:52.249 --> 40:53.511
Stop what?

40:53.651 --> 40:55.118
Just some silliness.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.516
- And what's this?
- Oh, it's a music box.

41:01.659 --> 41:04.127
My father gave it to me
for my sixth birthday.

41:04.261 --> 41:05.626
He did the painting himself.

41:05.763 --> 41:07.424
So your father is an artist too?

41:07.565 --> 41:10.432
No. He always wanted to be an artist,
but the family disapproved.

41:10.568 --> 41:12.229
So, he took up law.

41:13.070 --> 41:16.233
The joke is I've never once
heard him discuss a case.

41:16.373 --> 41:19.934
He goes to his club every day,
and never his office.

41:20.077 --> 41:21.840
So, I don't really know
what he does.

41:23.180 --> 41:26.616
- Oh, dear.
- Wiggin is fallible.

41:26.750 --> 41:30.618
I'm afraid, Miss Potter, your
reputation is now officially dented.

41:31.856 --> 41:34.825
'Let me teach you how to dance'.
Do you dance, Miss Potter?

41:34.959 --> 41:37.223
No. Well, not well.

41:37.361 --> 41:38.919
I make a terrible hash of it too
when I try,

41:39.063 --> 41:40.530
but the words are very sweet.

41:40.664 --> 41:43.633
You know the words?
Will you sing the words?

41:46.370 --> 41:47.428
Well, er...

41:48.172 --> 41:51.630
#Let me teach you how to dance

41:52.676 --> 41:56.703
#Let me lead you to the floor

41:57.548 --> 42:01.416
#Simply place your hand in mine

42:01.952 --> 42:06.514
#And then think of nothing more.

42:07.157 --> 42:11.218
#Let the music cast its spell

42:11.862 --> 42:16.231
#Give the atmosphere a chance.

42:16.367 --> 42:21.031
#Simply follow where I lead

42:21.171 --> 42:26.438
#Let me teach you how to dance.

42:31.248 --> 42:32.408
Miss Potter.

42:34.051 --> 42:36.315
I know you have decided not to marry.

42:37.054 --> 42:38.919
All my life, I thought that
I would not marry either

42:39.056 --> 42:41.718
but something has happened that
has caused me to change my mind.

42:41.859 --> 42:43.724
No, please, let me go on,
for if I do not say

42:43.861 --> 42:46.022
what I have to say it now,
I fear I never will.

42:47.765 --> 42:51.531
Miss Potter,
I would like you to consider...

42:51.669 --> 42:52.533
Mr Warne.

42:52.670 --> 42:56.231
doing me the honour, and I do not
expect an immediate answer.

42:56.373 --> 42:57.533
Beatrix?

42:59.376 --> 43:02.140
I was just showing Mr Warne
his Christmas present.

43:04.148 --> 43:06.616
I'm an impeccably genteel,
unmarried lady, Mother.

43:06.750 --> 43:09.014
I haven't begun to invite
men to my room.

43:09.153 --> 43:10.313
Mr Warne?

43:22.266 --> 43:23.426
Wiggin!

43:35.579 --> 43:37.706
What is the picture, Beatrix?

43:41.452 --> 43:45.013
I've written and drawn
little children's books,

43:45.155 --> 43:47.020
which have been published.

43:47.157 --> 43:51.924
The man who published them is here.
Mr Norman Warne.

43:52.062 --> 43:56.226
To thank him for his assistance
and generosity...

43:57.668 --> 43:59.033
Well... I'm...

43:59.169 --> 44:01.433
I'm writing him a Christmas story.

44:02.773 --> 44:05.640
- Can we hear it?
- It isn't finished, so...

44:05.776 --> 44:07.141
Oh, go on.

44:09.380 --> 44:12.110
I suppose, before we part
for the evening,

44:12.249 --> 44:19.018
I could share a glimpse of
the unfinished tale of

44:19.156 --> 44:21.420
'The Rabbits' Christmas Party'.

44:25.963 --> 44:30.923
One particularly snowy Christmas Eve,
a young rabbit and

44:31.068 --> 44:36.335
his fearsome older brothers
and fiercely brave sister

44:36.473 --> 44:40.034
set out on a journey they make
every year to celebrate

44:40.177 --> 44:41.838
with their friends.

44:41.979 --> 44:45.107
Now, rabbits are highly sociable
creatures, and legend has it that

44:45.249 --> 44:47.809
wherever they find themselves
on Christmas Eve,

44:47.951 --> 44:51.819
they get together and
throw a jolly party!

44:52.356 --> 44:56.622
Now, I know such a legend exists
because I made it up.

44:58.862 --> 45:02.229
The rabbits travel through
the woods to the well-appointed

45:02.366 --> 45:07.929
burrow of their cousins where
a warm fire is waiting for them.

45:08.072 --> 45:13.840
They take off their frosty coats
and the party begins!

45:13.977 --> 45:16.912
Now, I know on this night
that they will eat and talk

45:17.047 --> 45:22.007
and dance and laugh and
roast apples on the fire!

45:22.152 --> 45:26.521
But I'm not certain
how the story ends,

45:26.657 --> 45:30.616
because I haven't made
that part up yet.

45:31.562 --> 45:35.931
But, in any case, Mr Warne will
have to read it first,

45:36.066 --> 45:38.933
as he is my strict censor,

45:39.069 --> 45:41.629
and, well, it is his present.

45:41.772 --> 45:43.535
Merry Christmas, Mr Warne.

45:44.475 --> 45:46.636
Thank you, Miss Potter.
It's so beautiful.

45:48.779 --> 45:51.805
There'll be no problem with presents
for the grandchildren next year,

45:51.949 --> 45:55.112
- I dare say.
- You must be very proud, Helen.

45:55.252 --> 45:57.812
It's just a children's story.

45:59.256 --> 46:00.518
Outstanding!

46:00.657 --> 46:03.217
- Can I talk to you?
- Of course.

46:08.766 --> 46:10.427
What is it?
Is there something wrong?

46:10.567 --> 46:13.127
No. As my confidante.

46:13.971 --> 46:16.940
You have something to confide?
How delicious!

46:18.075 --> 46:21.533
Your brother has asked me
to marry him,

46:21.678 --> 46:26.615
and I feel, quite irrationally,
that I may say, 'yes'.

46:28.552 --> 46:30.315
I'd like your approval.

46:32.856 --> 46:34.221
My approval?

46:35.759 --> 46:39.320
Beatrix, don't be a fool.

46:40.564 --> 46:41.724
Marry him.

46:42.766 --> 46:46.634
Tomorrow. Don't waste a moment.
How could you hesitate?

46:46.770 --> 46:48.135
You're not upset?

46:48.872 --> 46:49.930
Well, why would I be upset?

46:50.073 --> 46:54.737
Well, both Norman and I.
You'll be alone.

46:54.878 --> 46:58.314
You have a chance for happiness,
and you're worrying about me?

46:58.448 --> 47:01.110
I wouldn't worry about you if,
if someone came along

47:01.251 --> 47:04.516
who loved me and whom I loved,
I would trample my mother.

47:05.756 --> 47:07.724
- Do you love Norman?
- Yes.

47:07.858 --> 47:12.420
Then marry him. Don't you dare
think about anyone else.

47:12.563 --> 47:14.827
But what about all
the blessings of being alone?

47:14.965 --> 47:15.932
Hogwash.

47:16.066 --> 47:18.432
What else is a woman on her own
supposed to say?

47:19.770 --> 47:23.729
You have a chance to be loved.
Take it.

47:24.775 --> 47:25.639
And leave me happy,

47:25.776 --> 47:28.939
knowing that the two people
that I love are happy.

47:29.079 --> 47:32.412
That is the most thought
you should ever have for me.

47:32.549 --> 47:35.814
There you are, Beatrix!
The guests.

47:35.953 --> 47:37.215
Yes, Mother.

47:38.455 --> 47:39.615
Millie...

47:44.161 --> 47:45.321
Go.

47:47.965 --> 47:50.024
What is going on tonight?

47:51.068 --> 47:54.435
Why do I feel like a stranger
in my own home?

47:54.571 --> 47:57.335
You have a clever daughter, Rupert.
You must be very proud.

47:57.474 --> 48:00.534
- Of Beatrix? Yes, we are.
- To write and draw like that!

48:00.677 --> 48:04.408
Beatrix should meet my niece, Anne.
She makes pots.

48:04.548 --> 48:08.006
- Ceramics, Nigel.
- Look like pots to me.

48:09.753 --> 48:14.622
As for you, madam,
I suggest you take up knitting.

48:14.758 --> 48:16.020
Merry Christmas.

48:21.765 --> 48:23.130
What was all that about?

48:23.267 --> 48:25.132
Sir Nigel disapproves of the way
I play whist.

48:25.269 --> 48:27.737
I'm afraid I won two guineas from him.

48:27.871 --> 48:29.031
Mr Warne!

48:30.474 --> 48:33.739
- Your painting.
- Oh, yes. My Christmas present.

48:38.849 --> 48:40.009
Yes.

48:47.958 --> 48:50.324
- Goodbye, Mr Warne.
- Goodbye, Mr Warne.

49:52.356 --> 49:53.015
Sir?

49:53.156 --> 49:56.023
I have an appointment to see
Mr Rupert Potter in the Eagleton Room.

49:56.159 --> 49:58.423
- He's expecting you, sir.
- Thank you.

50:11.575 --> 50:13.941
Come along, Norman,
it's only her father.

50:17.047 --> 50:18.207
Come in.

50:26.957 --> 50:28.925
Thank you very much, Mr Potter,
for taking the time

50:29.059 --> 50:30.617
out of your very busy day.

50:30.761 --> 50:32.228
Goodbye, Mr Warne.

50:37.167 --> 50:38.634
If you will not accept our advice
in this decision,

50:38.769 --> 50:40.430
then we will have to impose
that advice.

50:40.570 --> 50:43.835
Respect our knowledge and
the worth of our opinions, Beatrix.

50:49.079 --> 50:51.411
Oi! Get over there!

50:53.650 --> 50:56.016
I said that I'll do it and I will.

50:56.153 --> 50:58.713
Norman Warne is a tradesman, Beatrix.
No Potter can marry into trade,

50:58.855 --> 51:00.720
- and that's final.
- And what are we?

51:00.857 --> 51:03.325
Father's money comes from
Grandfather's printing works

51:03.460 --> 51:06.429
in Lancashire.
A trade, Mother.

51:06.563 --> 51:08.531
And if Grandfather hadn't
run for parliament,

51:08.665 --> 51:11.634
we'd still be living
in the shadow of his factories.

51:11.768 --> 51:15.829
Your legacy came from Grandfather
Leech's cotton trade.

51:15.972 --> 51:18.236
When did we become
so high and mighty?

51:18.375 --> 51:21.936
We're parvenus, Mother.
Social climbers.

51:22.079 --> 51:25.310
Your father and I We will not
allow this marriage for your own good,

51:25.449 --> 51:26.916
and there is no reason to
become insulting!

51:27.050 --> 51:29.610
It's not an insult!
It's the truth!

51:29.753 --> 51:33.018
Our lives are pretension and
social aspiration.

51:33.156 --> 51:35.124
Sir this and Lady that!

51:35.258 --> 51:38.421
Norman Warne is a gentleman
of comfortable means,

51:38.562 --> 51:43.829
and not one bit beneath us,
and I intend to marry him.

51:43.967 --> 51:47.130
Not if you expect to take
one penny of your inheritance!

51:47.270 --> 51:49.329
You haven't disinherited Bertram
for running off

51:49.473 --> 51:51.737
with a wine merchant's daughter.

51:51.875 --> 51:55.038
Happily, I am a published author.
I have means of my own.

51:55.178 --> 51:57.009
This discussion is over.

52:10.260 --> 52:11.625
Come in, Father.

52:13.663 --> 52:17.622
Why is it that after any difficult
situation, she always sends you?

52:17.767 --> 52:19.428
Mama didn't send me.

52:21.071 --> 52:25.735
I don't like tension in my home.
I want to resolve this matter.

52:25.876 --> 52:28.344
Well, you can't.
I've made my decision.

52:28.478 --> 52:31.914
Your mother wants what is
best for you, as do I, Beatrix.

52:32.048 --> 52:34.209
An impulsive and inappropriate
marriage is something that

52:34.351 --> 52:36.114
you would ultimately regret.

52:36.253 --> 52:38.517
You can't allow me to
marry and leave.

52:38.655 --> 52:40.714
With Bertram moved away,
who would take care of you?

52:40.857 --> 52:42.916
You surely do not think
we would deny you happiness

52:43.059 --> 52:45.425
just simply because we needed
a nursemaid?

52:45.562 --> 52:46.426
That is a knife in my heart.

52:46.563 --> 52:48.622
Well, then, what is it, Father,
because I cannot understand.

52:48.765 --> 52:50.733
You cannot make us the villains,
Beatrix.

52:50.867 --> 52:54.633
Your mother trotted out countless
suitors all of them acceptable.

52:54.771 --> 52:57.433
- You rejected every one of them.
- I know that, Father.

52:57.574 --> 53:00.543
I didn't want to be a silly woman
marrying a man simply

53:00.677 --> 53:04.807
because he was acceptable,
or rich enough to take care of me.

53:04.948 --> 53:08.406
But does that mean that
I'm never to be loved?

53:10.153 --> 53:11.313
Father?

53:15.759 --> 53:18.421
Wiggin, wait here, please.

53:23.266 --> 53:27.532
I'd like to enquire about my
royalty earnings, Mr Copperthwaite.

53:27.671 --> 53:34.941
And whether I might, at some stage,
afford a house of my own

53:35.078 --> 53:36.602
in the country.

53:36.746 --> 53:41.206
You have enough to buy an estate.
Several estates, and a house in town.

53:41.351 --> 53:44.013
You're quite a wealthy woman,
Miss Potter.

53:45.455 --> 53:47.013
Am I truly?

53:47.157 --> 53:51.821
Yes, the income has become
quite regular.

53:51.962 --> 53:55.625
If your fortune continues to grow,
you should have no financial worries

53:55.765 --> 53:57.733
for the rest of your life.

54:01.371 --> 54:02.838
Extraordinary.

54:18.355 --> 54:19.515
Beatrix.

54:20.056 --> 54:22.320
Beatrix, come and sit with us,
please.

54:22.459 --> 54:26.122
- I'd rather not, Father.
- We have something to discuss.

54:26.263 --> 54:26.922
A proposition.

54:27.063 --> 54:30.624
And, for heaven's sake, Beatrix.
Let the servants carry your dishes.

54:35.372 --> 54:37.340
- Tea?
- No, thank you.

54:37.474 --> 54:40.034
Nonsense. You always take tea.

54:40.176 --> 54:43.236
Contrary to what you think and
what you have so vehemently

54:43.346 --> 54:47.407
expressed, your mama and I
want you to be happy.

54:47.550 --> 54:50.917
We simply doubt that
this marriage will do the trick.

54:51.054 --> 54:54.023
Helen, please.
Sit down, Beatrix.

54:56.259 --> 54:58.727
What we don't want is for you
to rush into something

54:58.862 --> 55:01.228
which you may later wish
to reconsider.

55:01.364 --> 55:02.626
I won't want to reconsider.

55:02.766 --> 55:05.530
- We are not convinced.
- Helen, please.

55:06.369 --> 55:11.534
We are not convinced.
Yet, neither have we hearts of stone.

55:12.275 --> 55:15.142
Therefore, this is what we propose.

55:16.479 --> 55:18.913
You may accept Mr. Warne,

55:19.049 --> 55:23.418
but it must remain a complete
secret even from his own family.

55:23.553 --> 55:26.113
Now, this summer, yourself,
Mama and I will go,

55:26.256 --> 55:28.315
as always, to the Lake District.

55:28.458 --> 55:33.521
If, at the end of the summer,
you still wish to proceed,

55:33.663 --> 55:36.826
then we will announce
your engagement

55:36.966 --> 55:40.834
and you can marry with
our blessing and our love.

55:43.173 --> 55:44.834
Why must no one know?

55:44.974 --> 55:47.033
So there'll be no public
embarrassment when you change.

55:47.177 --> 55:51.011
- If, If you change your mind.
- If.

55:52.048 --> 55:55.017
Now, Beatrix, if you care for
this man as much as you say you do,

55:55.151 --> 55:58.917
then in a few months the ardour
will still be there.

55:59.055 --> 56:05.016
If your mother, and I, are correct,
and this emotion cools with time,

56:05.161 --> 56:10.224
then we will have protected you
against humiliation and unhappiness.

56:10.367 --> 56:13.530
- It will not cool.
- Beatrix, listen to me.

56:13.670 --> 56:15.638
A woman at your age must
consider very carefully...

56:15.772 --> 56:20.232
Mother, the only thing true
at my age is that at my age,

56:20.377 --> 56:22.538
every day matters.

56:27.751 --> 56:32.620
Very well, Mother, Father,
I accept your terms.

56:32.756 --> 56:35.919
Norman and I may decide to
wait in any case.

56:38.661 --> 56:40.128
But make plans.

56:40.263 --> 56:43.232
There will be a wedding
in this house by October.

57:45.161 --> 57:46.321
They're beautiful.

58:25.068 --> 58:26.729
Which carriage, Rupert?

58:27.570 --> 58:28.730
Saunders?

58:31.174 --> 58:34.439
Four carriages down.
This way.

58:45.255 --> 58:46.415
Well...

58:48.057 --> 58:51.026
- This is the Potters' for Windermere.
- Right you are, sir.

58:52.862 --> 58:54.830
Here and those two.

58:58.968 --> 59:00.230
Beatrix!

59:08.778 --> 59:10.109
Mr. Warne!

59:12.649 --> 59:14.207
Oh, I do apologise.

59:27.964 --> 59:30.330
- Miss Potter!
- Mr. Warne!

59:30.466 --> 59:32.832
I was beginning to fear
you wouldn't come.

59:32.969 --> 59:33.628
You're soaked.

59:33.770 --> 59:35.032
It wasn't raining
when I left the office.

59:35.171 --> 59:37.230
I brought you the proof of
the new book for your trip.

59:37.373 --> 59:41.241
- Oh, you'll catch cold.
- I couldn't miss seeing you off.

59:41.377 --> 59:43.242
You know nothing would stop me.

59:43.346 --> 59:45.405
This is going to be the longest
summer I've ever spent.

59:45.548 --> 59:48.016
- It's only the summer. That's all.
- Yes.

59:48.151 --> 59:50.619
And this time is not for us.
It's for your parents.

59:50.753 --> 59:53.415
How can they know what we're feeling?
They've never felt it.

59:53.556 --> 59:55.717
We can afford them
this three months.

59:56.259 --> 59:57.726
I suppose.

59:58.861 --> 01:00:01.329
This is not how I wish
to say goodbye to you.

01:00:19.248 --> 01:00:23.309
Goodbye, Miss Potter.
I look forward to your speedy return.

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:25.819
As do I, Mr. Warne.

01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:27.820
Quickly. Here.

01:00:35.264 --> 01:00:36.731
Goodbye, Miss Potter.

01:00:37.867 --> 01:00:39.630
Goodbye, Mr. Warne.

01:00:41.771 --> 01:00:44.137
Goodbye, Norman.

01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:16.236
My dear, dear Norman,

01:01:16.372 --> 01:01:19.933
this absurd forced separation
is surely a kind of madness,

01:01:20.076 --> 01:01:25.605
most notably, that of my mother,
but you are here, my dear, for me.

01:01:25.748 --> 01:01:28.216
The beauty of this place seems
magnified somehow,

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:30.216
with you in my mind.

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:34.517
In my occasional lonely moments,
I imagine conversations between us,

01:01:34.657 --> 01:01:39.117
and yesterday startled a duck with
my declaration of love for you.

01:01:39.562 --> 01:01:42.122
All of my thoughts are with you,
my darling.

01:01:42.265 --> 01:01:45.530
I know that you find Harold
and Fruing terribly boring,

01:01:45.668 --> 01:01:47.636
but, in fact, I'm having
what I could almost describe

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:49.931
as wild enjoyment working
with them.

01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:52.041
You may wake up, one day,
to find yourself married

01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:53.642
to a businessman.

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:57.704
Praise the day when I can wake up
to find you beside me.

01:01:59.949 --> 01:02:02.509
I took one of the boats out
onto the lake at sunset

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:05.212
to watch the water hens feeding.

01:02:05.354 --> 01:02:07.822
They made noises like kissing.

01:02:07.957 --> 01:02:10.425
I closed my eyes and pictured you.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.926
I find I love my heart more now,

01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:15.724
because that is where I know
I can find you.

01:02:15.865 --> 01:02:18.425
Amelia sends her fond love and
wishes for us all

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:19.830
to be together again,

01:02:19.969 --> 01:02:22.938
as do I, multiplied a hundredfold.

01:02:29.779 --> 01:02:32.612
Sir... Hill Top Farm.

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:35.217
May I ask,
is it a working farm?

01:02:35.351 --> 01:02:41.312
Aye. Another great one falls,
but this one breaks your heart.

01:02:41.457 --> 01:02:43.220
Really? Why?

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:45.921
Now, miss, a body would have to

01:02:46.062 --> 01:02:49.122
be a poet, which I certainly am not.

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:53.627
Excuse me, but I'd swear you
were someone I once knew.

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:55.635
Good heavens, Willie Heelis!

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:56.830
Miss Beatrix! Miss Potter!

01:02:56.973 --> 01:02:59.134
- Is that you?
- How good to see you!

01:02:59.275 --> 01:03:00.936
Well, hello!

01:03:01.377 --> 01:03:03.811
I see you've given up on the law.

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:06.005
Have you decided to make
an honest living?

01:03:06.149 --> 01:03:09.312
Ah, yes, the law.
Well, not exactly. No, no.

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:14.116
A country solicitor needs to
be proficient in many skills.

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:17.226
And it suits me to be out of
the office now and again.

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:21.726
Now, I could show you Hill Top,
if you have the time.

01:03:23.566 --> 01:03:26.933
Yes. Yes.
Time is exactly what I have.

01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:28.229
Good.

01:03:38.147 --> 01:03:42.106
- Not a bad outlook, Miss Potter.
- It's sublime.

01:03:43.853 --> 01:03:45.912
By chance, I met an old friend
today who showed me

01:03:46.055 --> 01:03:48.421
a beautiful farm that's for sale.

01:03:48.558 --> 01:03:51.721
It would be a perfect country home,
and though I know we'll live

01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:53.226
mainly in the city

01:03:53.362 --> 01:03:56.525
I'm very keen to share
my favourite places with you.

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:15.907
The post has arrived and, once again,
no letter from your Mr. Warne.

01:04:16.052 --> 01:04:19.112
Is it time for me to start getting
just a little hopeful?

01:04:19.255 --> 01:04:22.418
He did mention he might take
a few days' holiday.

01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:24.822
The post is no doubt slow
from wherever he's gone.

01:04:24.961 --> 01:04:26.121
Indeed.

01:04:26.262 --> 01:04:29.629
But there is something that
appears to be from

01:04:29.765 --> 01:04:31.630
that interesting sister of his.

01:04:31.767 --> 01:04:34.634
Millie? How delightful!

01:04:37.373 --> 01:04:38.635
Excuse me.

01:05:04.767 --> 01:05:06.234
Norman is ill.

01:05:34.864 --> 01:05:38.231
- I'm Beatrix Potter.
- Please come in, miss.

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:43.538
- Ah, Miss Potter.
- Hello.

01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:47.033
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

01:05:47.877 --> 01:05:51.506
- I came as soon as I heard.
- Yes. It's very kind of you.

01:05:51.647 --> 01:05:53.410
Very, very kind indeed.

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:55.410
How is he?

01:05:56.852 --> 01:05:58.012
Beatrix.

01:06:01.257 --> 01:06:02.417
Millie?

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:05.920
Millie?

01:06:13.369 --> 01:06:14.631
I'm too late.

01:06:25.047 --> 01:06:26.605
He was so happy.

01:06:28.451 --> 01:06:30.419
He sang songs.

01:06:30.553 --> 01:06:33.021
He made me dance with him
in the parlour.

01:06:34.256 --> 01:06:37.316
He laughed all the time,
everyone noticed the change in him.

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:39.121
Only I knew the reason.

01:06:40.963 --> 01:06:46.731
But all summer, he had a cough,
and then the cough got worse,

01:06:46.869 --> 01:06:50.532
and in one night, he was gone.

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:54.837
It was so sudden. I keep thinking
that it hasn't happened.

01:06:54.977 --> 01:06:57.002
I keep expecting to see him
in the garden.

01:06:58.447 --> 01:06:59.812
When's the funeral?

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:02.112
It was yesterday.

01:07:04.653 --> 01:07:06.416
It was only the immediate family,
and I...

01:07:06.555 --> 01:07:09.319
Well, I couldn't think of a reason
to ask them to delay it for you.

01:07:15.564 --> 01:07:19.227
It was considerate of you to come
and pay your respects, Miss Potter.

01:07:19.368 --> 01:07:22.735
Our mother is particularly moved,
and is sorry she isn't well enough

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:25.238
to come down to greet you.

01:07:25.374 --> 01:07:28.832
I'll be taking over our late brother's
business affairs, Miss Potter.

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:31.706
Fine.

01:07:31.847 --> 01:07:34.714
I want to assure you that F Warne
and company will do everything

01:07:34.850 --> 01:07:38.911
in its power to ensure that
our tragic loss causes you

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:41.114
the least possible inconvenience.

01:07:41.757 --> 01:07:45.921
Please accept the gratitude
of the entire family.

01:07:56.272 --> 01:07:59.639
- They want me to go.
- I'm sorry.

01:08:22.564 --> 01:08:25.033
Miss Beatrix!
What are you doing in London?

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:27.533
- Is something wrong?
- A friend died.

01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:29.035
I'm sorry, miss.

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:31.535
Was she a close friend?

01:09:08.077 --> 01:09:09.544
Miss Beatrix?

01:09:11.747 --> 01:09:13.214
Miss Beatrix?

01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:19.617
I'll leave your dinner outside
the door, then, miss.

01:09:41.076 --> 01:09:44.511
Saunders is here, Miss Potter,
to take you to the station.

01:09:45.346 --> 01:09:47.814
I shan't be going back to the Lakes.

01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:49.712
Can I get you anything, then?

01:09:51.353 --> 01:09:53.014
Nothing, Hilda.

01:09:54.256 --> 01:09:55.917
Very well, Miss Potter.

01:11:40.763 --> 01:11:42.526
Beatrix, it's Millie.

01:11:45.367 --> 01:11:48.825
Look, I know I'm unannounced,
but they sent back all my messages.

01:11:50.472 --> 01:11:52.633
Please, please, please, let me in.

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:20.429
We've got to get you out of here.
Come on. Come on.

01:12:20.569 --> 01:12:23.129
Let's get you washed and dressed
and out of this room.

01:12:23.272 --> 01:12:24.933
Go and find something to wear.

01:12:27.876 --> 01:12:29.036
I can't.

01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:34.509
Millie!

01:12:35.551 --> 01:12:36.813
I can't!

01:12:51.767 --> 01:12:53.928
I've been torturing myself.

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:56.929
I should never have encouraged
you with Norman.

01:12:57.072 --> 01:12:59.632
I'd have saved you all
this terrible grief.

01:13:01.076 --> 01:13:02.338
I loved him.

01:13:04.546 --> 01:13:06.013
I loved him too.

01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:09.112
But he's gone.

01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:17.821
I must leave this house.

01:13:22.765 --> 01:13:24.528
I will leave this house.

01:13:45.654 --> 01:13:46.916
Congratulations, Miss Potter.

01:13:47.055 --> 01:13:49.853
You are now the proud owner
of Hill Top Farm.

01:13:50.058 --> 01:13:51.320
Thank you, George.

01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:55.225
Well, I'm sure you'll be
very happy at Hill Top.

01:13:55.364 --> 01:13:57.025
I spent some time there
as a child.

01:13:57.166 --> 01:14:01.830
Is that so? I did have other
plans for it, but...

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:04.734
I'm sure that I will love it
in any case.

01:14:05.574 --> 01:14:08.441
Yes. If you need any other
assistance or help...

01:14:08.577 --> 01:14:10.602
Thank you very much, Mr Heelis.

01:14:10.746 --> 01:14:12.111
Good day.

01:14:12.247 --> 01:14:13.509
Good day, Miss Potter.

01:14:28.063 --> 01:14:31.328
What I don't understand, Beatrix,
is how you're going to pay

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:32.434
for this farm.

01:14:32.568 --> 01:14:35.230
I'm a writer, Mother.
People buy my work.

01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:37.235
Our daughter is famous, Helen.

01:14:37.372 --> 01:14:39.636
You are the only person
who doesn't know it.

01:14:45.848 --> 01:14:48.612
What I don't understand is
why you find it necessary

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:50.308
to leave your home.

01:14:50.452 --> 01:14:52.613
It is not a choice, Father.

01:14:53.455 --> 01:14:56.219
Beatrix, if I could undo anything...

01:14:56.358 --> 01:14:58.019
There's nothing to undo.

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:01.027
This has nothing to do
with you or Mother.

01:15:02.464 --> 01:15:04.523
I must make my own way.

01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:09.036
So you must.

01:15:10.472 --> 01:15:12.030
So you must.

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:40.730
Everybody out.

01:15:42.871 --> 01:15:44.133
You see?

01:15:44.273 --> 01:15:47.640
I told you we could not know
where our journey would lead.

01:15:47.776 --> 01:15:49.334
It has led us here.

01:15:50.345 --> 01:15:52.210
This is your new home.

01:16:03.058 --> 01:16:04.525
No tears!

01:17:57.372 --> 01:17:58.339
Miss.

01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:01.836
Millie!

01:18:05.147 --> 01:18:07.411
It's wonderful to see you!

01:18:07.549 --> 01:18:09.813
Oh, this place is perfect.

01:18:09.951 --> 01:18:11.111
Millie!

01:18:12.754 --> 01:18:14.813
What have you brought?

01:18:16.558 --> 01:18:19.527
I thought it best not to
bring this, but then...

01:18:19.661 --> 01:18:22.129
it jumped into my hand
as I walked out the door.

01:18:33.575 --> 01:18:34.735
I'm sorry.

01:18:41.249 --> 01:18:42.409
Thank you.

01:18:47.856 --> 01:18:49.414
It's getting easier.

01:18:50.659 --> 01:18:52.422
- It's getting etasier for me too.
- Good

01:18:54.763 --> 01:18:56.424
I'm painting again.

01:18:56.965 --> 01:19:02.232
My mind's going mad with the story.
I've got pigs running amuck up there.

01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:06.841
Well, it's this place, isn't it?

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:10.204
Who'd want to be cooped up in London
when they could be up here?

01:19:10.345 --> 01:19:13.212
- I'm so glad you came.
- Me too.

01:19:14.549 --> 01:19:18.110
I've been so lucky with visitors.
First, my brother Bertram,

01:19:18.253 --> 01:19:19.618
then my mother.

01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:22.622
You think that's lucky?
Your mother is a monster!

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:27.017
No, its fine. My mother and I have
come to an understanding.

01:19:27.162 --> 01:19:30.620
We've agreed to not
understand each other.

01:19:54.856 --> 01:19:58.417
Look, if some city slicker wants to
offer me a half-decent price

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:03.429
for a derelict property and then
pay me and my lads good money

01:20:03.565 --> 01:20:05.624
to knock the damn place down.

01:20:06.568 --> 01:20:08.433
Let him build what he likes.

01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:11.733
If we allow these city developers
to buy up our land,

01:20:11.873 --> 01:20:13.636
there'll be no more farming.

01:20:13.775 --> 01:20:18.712
and all you're left with is
a ruined landscape and no community.

01:20:23.251 --> 01:20:24.411
Miss Potter!

01:20:25.854 --> 01:20:27.617
Ah, Mr Heelis.

01:20:28.456 --> 01:20:30.424
I see you've found me.

01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:37.329
I played here so often as a child.
I know your farm very well.

01:20:38.466 --> 01:20:40.832
I swam in the stream,
played hide and seek in the woods

01:20:40.969 --> 01:20:42.630
with Cousin Charles.

01:20:43.672 --> 01:20:45.435
I brought you the executed deed
for the farm.

01:20:45.574 --> 01:20:48.543
At last.
Thank you very much, Mr Heelis.

01:20:49.377 --> 01:20:51.004
- Busy.
- Yes.

01:20:51.146 --> 01:20:56.209
Yes, I've asked Mr Canon to stay on
and run Hill Top as a working farm.

01:20:56.351 --> 01:20:58.216
I'm learning a great deal.

01:20:58.353 --> 01:21:01.117
I wish everyone who bought
land up here could be so...

01:21:01.656 --> 01:21:03.021
enlightened.

01:21:03.758 --> 01:21:05.623
You've bought a farm,
you've kept the workers on,

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.627
you're working the land and
you're preserving this place.

01:21:09.364 --> 01:21:11.924
Yes. It makes me happy.

01:21:13.768 --> 01:21:17.226
Mr Cannon says the two farms
adjoining mine are for sale.

01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:19.840
I'd hate to see the developers
get hold of them.

01:21:19.975 --> 01:21:21.943
Do you know anything about them?

01:21:24.446 --> 01:21:27.006
- Morning, Mr Canon.
- Miss Potter.

01:21:30.252 --> 01:21:31.719
My, they've grown!

01:21:33.054 --> 01:21:35.113
- Handsome lot, wouldn't you say?
- Yes.

01:21:36.057 --> 01:21:37.615
Have you named them?

01:21:37.759 --> 01:21:39.727
We don't often give them names,
Miss Potter.

01:21:39.861 --> 01:21:42.421
Makes it a bit hard,
come slaughtering time.

01:21:43.164 --> 01:21:44.529
Hello, Miss Potter!

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:50.630
Hello yourself, Mr Heelis.
To what do I owe this pleasure?

01:21:50.972 --> 01:21:53.133
I've come with a message.
Mr Hubbard is ill

01:21:53.275 --> 01:21:55.743
and will be unable to show you
the neighbouring farms today.

01:21:55.877 --> 01:21:59.813
- Oh, dear. It's not serious, I hope?
- Chronic illness, I'm afraid.

01:21:59.948 --> 01:22:01.711
Recurs several times a month.

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:04.717
Usually after a night
at the Rose And Crown.

01:22:05.553 --> 01:22:06.713
I see.

01:22:06.955 --> 01:22:10.015
Mr Hubbard wondered if I might
show you the properties instead.

01:22:11.159 --> 01:22:14.424
I'd be pleased to have
so knowledgeable a guide.

01:22:15.063 --> 01:22:17.031
I'll just get my shawl.

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:19.028
Well, it's prime land.

01:22:19.167 --> 01:22:21.226
There's a lot of profit
in building houses on it.

01:22:21.369 --> 01:22:23.929
But more value as
a working farm, surely?

01:22:24.072 --> 01:22:26.336
Spoken like a true
Lakes woman, Miss Potter.

01:22:26.474 --> 01:22:28.339
Indeed, Mr Heelis.

01:22:28.476 --> 01:22:30.603
You do realise I've never
been to an auction.

01:22:30.745 --> 01:22:31.905
It's simple enough.

01:22:32.047 --> 01:22:35.016
Don't bid too early and
stick to your limit.

01:22:35.150 --> 01:22:37.516
I know my limit, Mr Heelis.

01:22:38.253 --> 01:22:40.414
Craven's Mill Farm,

01:22:40.555 --> 01:22:44.218
40 acres of splendour.
£ 1,100 anywhere?

01:22:44.359 --> 01:22:46.224
£ 1,100 I'm bid.

01:22:46.361 --> 01:22:49.819
£ 1,150?
Come along, gentlemen.

01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:52.627
Splendid little farm, this.
Lots of development potential.

01:22:52.767 --> 01:22:56.533
£ 1,150.
£ 1,200 anywhere?

01:22:56.671 --> 01:22:59.731
£ 1,200.
£ 1,300 anywhere?

01:22:59.874 --> 01:23:02.434
Bidding, madam?
£ 1,300.

01:23:02.577 --> 01:23:04.909
Seated at £ 1,300.

01:23:05.046 --> 01:23:07.105
£ 1,400.

01:23:07.248 --> 01:23:08.715
£ 1,500.

01:23:08.850 --> 01:23:10.613
£ 1,600.

01:23:10.752 --> 01:23:13.016
Seven hundred.
Eight hundred.

01:23:13.154 --> 01:23:15.019
£ 1,900.

01:23:15.156 --> 01:23:19.923
At £ 1,900.
£ 2,000 at the back. £ 2,000

01:23:20.061 --> 01:23:23.622
Any more at £ 2,000.

01:23:23.765 --> 01:23:25.528
£ 2,300.

01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:29.535
- Rich Bastard!
- Thank you, sir. £ 2,300.

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:32.037
At £ 2,300.

01:23:32.173 --> 01:23:36.132
Any more, then, at £ 2,300?

01:23:36.277 --> 01:23:38.507
£ 2,500.

01:23:38.646 --> 01:23:40.307
The lady at £ 2,500.

01:23:40.448 --> 01:23:43.713
Against you, sir,
at £ 2,500. £ 2,800.

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:46.616
Miss Potter, you've bid more
than that farm is worth.

01:23:47.255 --> 01:23:53.216
£3,000, at £3,000 seated,
with the lady. Against you, sir.

01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:56.819
Are we all done at £3,000?

01:23:56.965 --> 01:23:58.125
Going once,

01:23:58.266 --> 01:24:00.427
Going twice,

01:24:00.568 --> 01:24:02.729
Sold to the lady, £3,000.

01:24:05.573 --> 01:24:08.633
Sir, you should control your client.

01:24:08.777 --> 01:24:11.507
She has allowed her emotions
to get the better of her.

01:24:11.646 --> 01:24:12.010
Really?

01:24:12.147 --> 01:24:15.412
She has squandered any possibility
of profit from that farm.

01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:17.108
It was prime development land.

01:24:17.252 --> 01:24:19.914
This place, this community
is an inspiration.

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:22.615
It should be conserved for
future generations,

01:24:22.757 --> 01:24:24.918
and not destroyed.
It deserves protection.

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:26.823
Madam, your observations are
woefully inadequate...

01:24:26.961 --> 01:24:30.829
Please, sir. I am no longer
in the habit of being lectured to,

01:24:30.965 --> 01:24:35.527
and, thankfully, I do not require
your approval or anyone else's.

01:24:35.670 --> 01:24:39.436
So, if you'll excuse us?
Mr Heelis?

01:24:47.949 --> 01:24:51.009
I hope you're not going to make
a habit of this, Miss Potter.

01:24:51.152 --> 01:24:54.519
Do you know, Mr Heelis,
I think I might.

01:24:54.656 --> 01:24:58.114
Now, will you have time tomorrow
to show me those other farms?

01:24:58.259 --> 01:25:00.921
- I certainly will.
- Excellent!

01:25:12.874 --> 01:25:13.932
Come in.

01:25:18.146 --> 01:25:19.306
Oh, my!

01:25:20.648 --> 01:25:22.115
Goodness me!

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:23.717
I'll be just a moment.

01:25:48.676 --> 01:25:53.204
Now then young man, how are you
taking to your new home?

01:25:54.649 --> 01:25:56.412
I know it's not London,

01:25:56.551 --> 01:25:59.019
but Hill Top might suit
a young rabbit better.

01:26:01.456 --> 01:26:03.219
He seems to be taking
to the place.

01:26:03.358 --> 01:26:05.826
As am I, Mr Heelis.

01:26:06.361 --> 01:26:08.625
- Now, the road.
- Oh, yes.

01:26:08.763 --> 01:26:10.424
Yes, of course, Miss Potter.

01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:17.137
How would you feel about
calling me William

01:26:17.272 --> 01:26:21.231
instead of this infernal Mr Heelis?
I sound like an undertaker.

01:26:21.376 --> 01:26:23.503
Of course, William.

01:26:23.645 --> 01:26:27.911
And I believe Beatrix might be
perfectly appropriate as well.

01:26:46.367 --> 01:26:51.031
There's something delicious about
writing the first few words of a story.

01:26:51.673 --> 01:26:54.233
You can never quite tell
where they're take you.

01:26:56.945 --> 01:27:01.006
Mine took me here.
Where I belong.
