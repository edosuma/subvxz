WEBVTT

01:29.630 --> 01:31.173
We're almost there, Conway.

01:31.632 --> 01:33.342
Just keep your eyes open.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.014
Something could still happen.

01:40.766 --> 01:42.226
Spider Conway.

01:47.398 --> 01:48.899
Don't know what he's worrying about.

01:49.108 --> 01:51.152
He's only got the sweetest deal
of the century.

01:53.404 --> 01:56.741
<i>A“ he's gotta do is make “he a canary
at the crime-commission hearings</i>

01:56.907 --> 01:59.076
and he gets 10 years off his time.

01:59.368 --> 02:02.246
It ain't him getting to the hearings
that's got him spooked, commish.

02:02.330 --> 02:04.957
It's somebody else
getting to him before then.

02:17.303 --> 02:18.387
There's a bomb on the boat!

02:21.015 --> 02:22.391
Abandon ship!

02:35.446 --> 02:37.907
Remind me never to think of you
as a good-luck charm.

02:40.534 --> 02:42.912
- Help!
- Over here! Help me!

02:53.172 --> 02:55.508
Carver,
I want Dock Street cordoned off,

02:55.591 --> 02:57.677
three blocks
in both directions. Move it.

02:58.302 --> 02:59.970
Hardesty, call Forensics.

03:04.058 --> 03:05.976
No sign of Conway anywhere, detective.

03:07.895 --> 03:09.355
Start dragging the bay.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.189
Taking me off the case?

03:52.565 --> 03:54.567
What kind of
shuck and jive is this, Jim?

03:55.151 --> 03:58.112
You know what I had to go through
just to get Conway out of Stonegate.

03:58.195 --> 04:00.906
But it's worth it if his testimony
can take down Rupert Thorne.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.660
Which is why
Thorne looks good for the bombing.

04:05.369 --> 04:07.163
But if I let you go after Thorne,

04:07.413 --> 04:09.874
a lot of ugly ancient history
is bound to come up.

04:18.132 --> 04:20.593
I gotta relieve you, Harv,
you know that.

04:21.135 --> 04:24.513
Unless, you want Internal Affairs
all over you like a bad rash.

04:58.964 --> 05:00.341
Ancient history.

05:00.758 --> 05:02.384
Yeah, right!

05:20.528 --> 05:22.363
A real page-turner, isn't it?

05:23.239 --> 05:24.323
Indeed.

05:25.115 --> 05:28.327
Bullock was suspected
of accepting graft from Thorne

05:28.452 --> 05:29.620
two years ago?

05:30.037 --> 05:32.957
Right, but the case was dropped
for lack of evidence.

05:34.792 --> 05:37.127
It was just before Spider Conway
went to prison.

05:37.628 --> 05:39.046
And at the time of his arrest,

05:39.380 --> 05:41.090
Conway was working for Thorne.

05:41.549 --> 05:44.593
So, he might know something
that Bullock doesn't want revealed.

05:44.927 --> 05:48.305
Surely you can't think
this Bullock person planted that bomb.

05:48.639 --> 05:50.516
I'm not sure yet what to think.

05:50.808 --> 05:53.227
After the explosion,
I went out to Stonegate Island,

05:53.394 --> 05:55.354
to check out the dock
the boat left from.

05:55.938 --> 05:57.606
I found this.

05:58.941 --> 06:00.359
A toothpick?

06:10.661 --> 06:12.246
Where in the world...

06:19.545 --> 06:21.672
Hey! Anybody here?

06:38.063 --> 06:39.189
Not you!

06:39.481 --> 06:40.566
It can't be!

06:41.191 --> 06:42.318
Stay back!

07:15.768 --> 07:18.145
You'd better have the money
to pay for that.

07:22.232 --> 07:24.193
Here's how it works, slimeball.

07:24.610 --> 07:27.529
I have questions
and if you have answers,

07:27.947 --> 07:29.573
I'll leave you alone.

07:31.241 --> 07:33.786
Oh, I got plenty of answers.

07:37.873 --> 07:40.376
.38-caliber answers.

07:48.467 --> 07:50.260
Now, then, you were saying?

07:52.721 --> 07:54.056
I was saying,

07:54.640 --> 07:59.019
you'd better hope
your men are very good shots.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.563
It's too hot in here.

08:01.647 --> 08:02.773
Let's get some air.

08:30.342 --> 08:31.635
Wait! Stop!

08:31.844 --> 08:32.845
I'll tell you anything you want.

08:33.137 --> 08:35.806
Did you order Spider Conway blown up?

08:36.056 --> 08:38.017
That loser?

08:38.100 --> 08:40.019
I wouldn't wipe my shoes on him.

08:40.394 --> 08:41.854
Conway's got nothing on me.

08:41.937 --> 08:43.105
Let him talk.

08:45.107 --> 08:46.358
He could've talked his head off.

08:46.442 --> 08:47.443
No problem.

08:47.776 --> 08:48.819
Okay.

08:52.656 --> 08:55.242
Don't just stand there, you clowns.

08:55.534 --> 08:57.202
Get me down!

09:01.957 --> 09:03.834
No trace of Conway yet, commissioner.

09:04.376 --> 09:05.461
Well, keep at it.

09:05.586 --> 09:07.171
I'll meet you back at headquarters.

09:15.471 --> 09:17.723
I've had cats
that made more noise than you.

09:17.973 --> 09:20.267
We need to talk about Bullock.

09:25.689 --> 09:28.275
I think he might have been responsible
for the bomb.

09:28.525 --> 09:29.526
Come on.

09:29.818 --> 09:32.696
You know there was evidence
that Conway falsely implicated Bullock

09:32.780 --> 09:33.864
at the graft inquest.

09:34.239 --> 09:36.200
But you have no proof Conway lied.

09:36.825 --> 09:39.411
Look, Harvey Bullock
is hard to work with,

09:39.495 --> 09:40.788
even harder to like.

09:41.246 --> 09:42.706
But he's a good cop, Batman.

09:42.831 --> 09:43.832
He's clean.

09:43.916 --> 09:44.917
Commissioner?

09:46.502 --> 09:48.337
- Something?
- Not a trace.

09:48.712 --> 09:49.713
All right.

09:49.922 --> 09:51.048
Pull them back in.

09:51.673 --> 09:53.008
We'll have to assume the worst.

09:54.593 --> 09:55.761
Batman?

09:56.929 --> 09:58.305
For once, my friend,

09:58.722 --> 10:00.474
I hope your instincts are wrong.

10:22.287 --> 10:24.540
Joey the Snail,

10:24.623 --> 10:28.127
brought in last night on a 605, right?

10:28.252 --> 10:29.545
Let me see him.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.130
Bullock, that you?

10:31.421 --> 10:33.465
Yeah. Now, let me see him.

10:33.924 --> 10:36.009
I need to check your authorization.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.614
Rise and shine, Joey.

10:59.116 --> 11:00.534
Who's there?

11:00.701 --> 11:03.287
Your worst nightmare.

11:04.246 --> 11:06.415
No! Keep away from me!

11:48.832 --> 11:50.042
Master Bruce?

11:52.544 --> 11:56.173
Still intent on that scale,
or what-have-you, I see.

11:56.757 --> 11:57.841
Believe it or not,

11:57.925 --> 11:59.927
the cellular structure is human,

12:00.385 --> 12:02.471
but the texture of it is almost...

12:03.013 --> 12:04.097
Reptilian.

12:04.723 --> 12:06.266
Hmm. Do tell.

12:06.516 --> 12:09.353
Bullock might not be the primary suspect
after all.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.980
In any event, I've made your favorite,

12:12.064 --> 12:13.315
French onion soup.

12:13.857 --> 12:16.485
And, when you let it get cold this time,

12:16.610 --> 12:19.780
note that it's in a microwavable crock.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.365
Crock?

12:22.407 --> 12:24.660
Alfred, you're beautiful!

12:27.371 --> 12:30.666
Imagine if I'd gotten around
to telling him about the salad.

12:32.125 --> 12:34.670
<i>And, as you can see
by this re-creation of</i>

12:34.753 --> 12:37.005
<i>the crocodile's natural habitat,</i>

12:37.714 --> 12:41.093
<i>crocodiles make their lairs
in underwater caves.</i>

12:41.343 --> 12:42.594
Of course!

13:21.425 --> 13:22.634
Batman!

13:23.468 --> 13:24.970
Get us out of here!

13:30.684 --> 13:32.394
No telling what he'll do.

13:43.071 --> 13:46.283
Terrific. Just what I need now.

13:46.491 --> 13:48.660
The freak job in the cape.

13:48.785 --> 13:50.829
You're no prize yourself.

14:00.297 --> 14:02.299
What can I tell you?

14:02.758 --> 14:05.677
Being a reptile man ain't pretty,

14:06.053 --> 14:08.638
but it's got its upside.

14:08.930 --> 14:12.517
Like having the strength
of a crocodile, for instance.

14:15.896 --> 14:18.732
But I guess you've
learned that by now, huh?

14:18.857 --> 14:20.317
The hard way.

14:33.372 --> 14:36.458
You know,
they used to call "Killer Croc,"

14:36.583 --> 14:39.795
the meanest dude
in the Wrestling Federation.

14:40.170 --> 14:44.007
Now, they'll call him
the guy who iced the Batman.

14:52.432 --> 14:53.934
Don't hold your breath.

15:40.730 --> 15:44.234
You've been rooted to that spot
for over an hour, Master Bruce.

15:44.526 --> 15:46.945
It's taken me that long
to search through all these newspapers

15:47.070 --> 15:48.071
on microfiche.

15:49.781 --> 15:50.782
Here.

15:50.866 --> 15:54.035
From <i>the Miami Times Herald,</i>
four years ago.

15:54.244 --> 15:55.245
See?

15:55.328 --> 15:57.998
He started out
a carnival sideshow attraction,

15:58.248 --> 15:59.916
then became a pro-wrestler.

16:00.459 --> 16:03.086
Two years later,
Croc had moved to Gotham City

16:03.211 --> 16:04.504
and turned to crime.

16:04.796 --> 16:06.715
He used to be strictly penny-ante.

16:06.965 --> 16:08.592
Until now, I'd never heard of him.

16:09.092 --> 16:11.636
But, according to this,
Bullock busted him

16:11.720 --> 16:14.473
based on the testimony
from Conway and Joey the Snail.

16:14.639 --> 16:16.308
Then Croc has escaped.

16:18.977 --> 16:21.605
And now, it's payback time.

16:22.814 --> 16:24.399
You have Conway and the Snail.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.234
They can clear Detective Bullock.

16:26.902 --> 16:29.571
True, but that won't get us Croc.

16:29.863 --> 16:32.574
He won't return to his lair,
now that I know where it is.

16:33.074 --> 16:35.452
I'll have to make him come to us.

17:09.110 --> 17:11.196
- Drive!
- Croc!

17:11.446 --> 17:13.532
- How did you...
- Escape? Simple.

17:14.616 --> 17:17.202
The guards don't think about the sewers.

17:17.994 --> 17:20.080
No one does, except me.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.832
It was you who set me up
for Spider and Joey.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.376
You got it.

17:24.459 --> 17:28.672
I wanted you to sweat it out
in a cell for a while, like I did.

17:28.880 --> 17:32.300
To know what it feels like,
the way I do.

17:32.884 --> 17:34.803
Huh? You?

18:22.892 --> 18:24.227
Give it up, Croc.

18:24.311 --> 18:25.812
I know everything now.

18:26.479 --> 18:28.898
You planted that toothpick
on the dock, didn't you?

18:29.232 --> 18:31.568
And you impersonated Bullock
at the jail.

18:35.989 --> 18:36.990
Yeah,

18:37.073 --> 18:40.327
and it would've gone down smooth
if you hadn't butted in.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.412
But, hey, I'm adaptable.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.873
When you grow up looking like I do,

18:44.998 --> 18:47.417
you gotta learn to go with the flow.

18:47.542 --> 18:50.003
I'll just take care of you first,

18:50.086 --> 18:51.254
then Bullock.

18:59.179 --> 19:01.848
See, this ain't no Batcave.

19:02.140 --> 19:04.267
You're on my turf now.

20:18.133 --> 20:19.134
Croc!

20:42.782 --> 20:43.783
Huh?

21:04.804 --> 21:05.805
Why?

21:06.181 --> 21:08.516
Why'd you stick your neck out
like that to help me?

21:08.641 --> 21:10.894
Because I thought you were guilty too

21:11.227 --> 21:12.395
and I was wrong.

21:13.313 --> 21:15.523
We may have different ways
of enforcing the law,

21:15.899 --> 21:17.442
but we both believe in it.

21:17.817 --> 21:20.278
Eh. Go on. I'll take it from here.

21:25.492 --> 21:26.993
Not a bad piece of work.

21:35.001 --> 21:36.294
Tell me, Detective Bullock,

21:36.419 --> 21:39.339
how does it feel to be
formally cleared of all charges,

21:39.422 --> 21:41.966
now that Killer Croc, Morgan,
has been arrested?

21:42.091 --> 21:45.887
<i>I just want all the scumbuckets
and dirtbags in this town</i>

21:46.012 --> 21:47.597
<i>to know they'd better lay low,</i>

21:47.680 --> 21:50.809
<i>because Bullock's back
and ready to kick butt!</i>

22:24.425 --> 22:25.426
