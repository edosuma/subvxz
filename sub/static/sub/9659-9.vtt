00:02.700 --> 00:05.215
<i>six teams raced
to the deserts of Dubai.</i>

00:05.250 --> 00:06.859
Ooh, girl, sand.

00:06.879 --> 00:08.958
<i>Sheri and Cole
got off to a slow start.</i>

00:08.959 --> 00:10.639
I don't even know
where the hell I am.

00:12.679 --> 00:15.438
<i>At the Detour,
camels tested team speed...</i>

00:15.439 --> 00:18.598
Everything! Go! Whoo!

00:18.599 --> 00:19.998
<i>..and endurance.</i>

00:19.999 --> 00:21.318
I can't do anymore.

00:21.319 --> 00:22.439
I'm going to pass out.

00:24.079 --> 00:25.518
<i>A puzzling Roadblock...</i>

00:25.519 --> 00:27.558

<i>..forced frontrunners

00:28.999 --> 00:30.318

00:30.319 --> 00:31.758
Express Pass.
We're going to pass it.

00:31.759 --> 00:33.398
Boom.
Good challenge.

00:33.399 --> 00:36.558
<i>..leading them
to a dominating fourth win.</i>

00:36.559 --> 00:40.038
<i>Sheri and Cole couldn't catch up,
but got a welcome reprieve.</i>

00:40.039 --> 00:42.318
This is a non-elimination leg.

00:42.319 --> 00:43.678
Oh, my God!

00:43.679 --> 00:45.678
<i>Six teams remain.</i>
-Oh, wow.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.718

01:51.581 --> 01:53.540
Dude, Kurt,
look at this Travelocity app, man.

01:53.541 --> 01:56.020
Helsinki, Finland, bro.
-Dude.

01:56.021 --> 01:57.580
Oh, that's sick.

01:57.581 --> 01:58.900
Oh, that's going to be funny.

01:58.901 --> 02:00.140
Boom!
-Let's go.

02:00.141 --> 02:01.940
Let's go!

02:01.941 --> 02:04.860
"Fly to Denpasar, gateway to Bali."

02:04.861 --> 02:09.500
Teams are leaving the dry,
desolate desert sands of Dubai

02:09.501 --> 02:12.061
and flying 4,600 miles...

02:13.141 --> 02:14.420
<i>..to Indonesia.</i>

<i>Tanah Lot.</i>

02:24.501 --> 02:26.700
Temple entrance. Let's go.
-Temple entrance. Let's go.

02:26.701 --> 02:28.890
Dude, Bali. Let's go!

02:28.891 --> 02:31.060
We're going to
the Dubai International Airport.

02:31.061 --> 02:33.060
This is our fourth
first-place finish.

02:33.061 --> 02:36.450
We would have liked to have kept
our Express Pass for this leg,

02:36.451 --> 02:38.380
but I was not going
to solve that puzzle.

02:38.381 --> 02:39.381
It just means, today,

02:39.382 --> 02:40.780
we're just going
to have to be on our game.

02:40.781 --> 02:42.700
We're going to the city...

02:42.701 --> 02:43.730
I'm guessing, yeah.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.060
..Desperado.

02:45.061 --> 02:46.820
Desperado.
(LAUGHS)

02:46.821 --> 02:48.341
We're going to...

02:49.341 --> 02:51.940
..Denpasar
and that is in Bali, apparently.

02:51.941 --> 02:53.700
We're getting really familiar
with second place.

02:53.701 --> 02:56.100
Yeah, this one
doesn't feel quite as bad

02:56.101 --> 02:59.420
because we know that Brodie and Kurt
had to burn their Express Pass

02:59.421 --> 03:01.060
in order to beat us to the mat.

03:01.061 --> 03:02.820
This time,
we're the only team that know

03:02.821 --> 03:04.740
that they don't have
their Express Pass anymore.

03:04.741 --> 03:07.500
This literally was, by far,
our hardest leg

03:07.501 --> 03:09.380
and we used our Express Pass.

03:09.381 --> 03:11.260
There's definitely some comfort

03:11.261 --> 03:13.580
knowing that they don't have
an Express Pass

03:13.581 --> 03:15.580
to get them out
of a hard spot anymore.

03:15.581 --> 03:17.620
You never know, they may need it.

03:17.621 --> 03:19.700
We know Brodie and Kurt
have an Express Pass

03:19.701 --> 03:21.620
and they have to use it this leg,

03:21.621 --> 03:24.020
but if Brodie and Kurt
made a mistake

03:24.021 --> 03:25.380
and got eliminated this leg,

03:25.381 --> 03:27.141
we wouldn't mind
seeing that happen at all.

03:28.941 --> 03:30.540
We're the top six teams right now

03:30.541 --> 03:33.460
and $1 million would be pretty cool.

03:33.461 --> 03:36.740
We want to adopt internationally
and that's expensive

03:36.741 --> 03:41.180
and so it would definitely help us
provide for... maybe lots of kids.

03:41.181 --> 03:43.900
"You have $132
for this leg of the race."

03:43.901 --> 03:46.140
Come on, let's go.
We're going to Bali.

03:46.141 --> 03:47.660
Ticket sales. Boom!

03:47.661 --> 03:52.020
So, we are needing two tickets
as fast as possible

03:52.021 --> 03:53.940
to get to Den...

03:53.941 --> 03:55.621
Denpasar, Indonesia.

03:59.301 --> 04:01.301
OK, what time would that get in?

04:06.261 --> 04:09.180
OK, there's nothing
that gets in before 10pm?

04:09.181 --> 04:11.621
And how many seats
are on that flight, do you know?

04:13.701 --> 04:16.060
So, we just lost our lead
right there.

04:16.060 --> 04:18.180
BOTH: Let's go!
-Alright.

04:18.180 --> 04:19.180
Even with a Speed Bump,

04:19.182 --> 04:21.339
I really think we're going
to surprise people and do very well.

04:21.341 --> 04:23.530
We're obviously the underdogs,
but...

04:23.531 --> 04:24.860
Honestly,
this has just all been a plan.

04:24.861 --> 04:26.061
All been a plan.

04:29.741 --> 04:31.980
So, we're here,
about to get on the flight to Bali.

04:31.981 --> 04:35.140
Everyone showed up,
even Sheri and Cole.

04:35.141 --> 04:37.180
Catching two non-eliminations
in one race -

04:37.181 --> 04:39.020
it's really lucky
for Sheri and Cole.

04:39.021 --> 04:40.181
All ready.

04:42.181 --> 04:44.140
<i>PHIL: All teams
are now making their way</i>

04:44.141 --> 04:46.805
<i>to the island of Bali in Indonesia.</i>

04:54.101 --> 04:55.380
Let's go! Let's go!
-Taxi!

04:55.381 --> 04:58.140
Tanah Lot? You know Tanah Lot?
-OK, let's go.

04:58.141 --> 05:00.210
Fast, fast, fast. We're in a race.

05:00.211 --> 05:01.620
We're heading to Tanah Lot.

05:01.621 --> 05:04.020
Whoo!
-Alright, it's scary driving here.

05:04.021 --> 05:05.460
They say there's two lanes in Bali -

05:05.461 --> 05:07.860
there's a car lane
and a motorcycle lane

05:07.861 --> 05:09.700
and the motorcycle lane
is pretty much

05:09.701 --> 05:11.090
wherever they want to go.

05:11.091 --> 05:13.820
We were one of the first two teams
to get out of here,

05:13.821 --> 05:15.860
so that's going to be
to our advantage.

05:15.861 --> 05:17.210
We have a Speed Bump this round.

05:17.211 --> 05:19.420
We have got
to perform everything perfectly.

05:19.421 --> 05:21.340
Thank goodness I'm not driving.

05:21.341 --> 05:23.500
We are completely even
on the Roadblocks...

05:23.501 --> 05:24.501
Yeah.

05:24.502 --> 05:26.740
..so we're in a really good position
to decide

05:26.741 --> 05:28.650
who does the Roadblock
based on our strengths.

05:28.651 --> 05:30.420
Some other teams
are way out of balance.

05:30.421 --> 05:32.820
Kurt, I think, has done
most of the Roadblocks

05:32.821 --> 05:37.140
and Kurt seems to be the stronger
Roadblock participant on that team.

05:37.141 --> 05:38.541
That could be trouble for them.

05:39.861 --> 05:41.060
Are we here?
-We're here?

05:41.061 --> 05:42.500
Alright, perfect.
-Thank you.

05:42.501 --> 05:43.940
Let's go.
-Go, go, go. Right here.

05:43.941 --> 05:45.300
Grab one, grab one.

05:45.301 --> 05:46.860
First one. Yes!

05:46.861 --> 05:47.980
Alright, here's the Clue Box.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.980
OK, hurry, hurry, hurry.
-I'm taking it.

05:49.981 --> 05:51.580
"In the morning,
search for your next clue

05:51.581 --> 05:53.700
"with a traditional
Balinese offering."

05:53.701 --> 05:55.420
Oh, two teams at a time.

05:55.421 --> 05:57.100
BOTH: Yay!

05:57.101 --> 05:59.020
So, we've got 15 minutes
above all the other teams.

05:59.021 --> 06:01.140
So, we're going to be 30 minutes
ahead of the last two, right?

06:01.141 --> 06:02.340
Yeah.
-That'll help us so much.

06:02.341 --> 06:04.420
Great.
-Nice job.

06:04.421 --> 06:07.100
We're third. I'm going to try real
quick to trade with Kurt and Brodie.

06:07.101 --> 06:08.101
Do you guys want to trade?

06:08.102 --> 06:09.900
Stop shining that bright light
in my eye. I can't see!

06:09.901 --> 06:12.341
Four.
-Four. Feeling good.

06:13.901 --> 06:15.780
OK, great. Cool. Team number five.

06:15.781 --> 06:17.181
Number six.

06:19.021 --> 06:20.821
That's killer. We're dead.

06:23.061 --> 06:27.181
(ALL CHANT)

06:33.061 --> 06:34.860
Here we go.

06:34.861 --> 06:36.340
Alright, straight.

06:36.341 --> 06:37.540
Right up here.
-Right.

06:37.541 --> 06:38.541
Here we go. Here we go.

06:38.542 --> 06:41.020
There it is. (LAUGHS)

06:41.021 --> 06:44.060
<i>PHIL: Teams must deliver
two types of offerings -</i>

06:44.061 --> 06:47.221
<i>the first to the monks
at Pura Enjung Galuh Temple...</i>

06:48.501 --> 06:52.420
<i>..and the second to their brethren
at the Snake Temple, Tanah Lot.</i>

06:52.421 --> 06:54.180
Over there.
Is that where we're thinking?

06:54.181 --> 06:56.500
That's got to be it.
-This is the offering.

06:56.501 --> 06:57.501
Handle with care.

06:57.502 --> 06:58.900
OK, you carry it on your head?

06:58.901 --> 07:00.740
Like this?
-That looks good to me.

07:00.741 --> 07:02.220
On your head.

07:02.221 --> 07:03.460
Nice and slow, dude.

07:03.461 --> 07:04.940
Are you sure
this is where we're going?

07:04.941 --> 07:06.980
I mean, this looks like a temple.

07:06.981 --> 07:08.220
There are monks right there, dude.

07:08.221 --> 07:09.300
This way?
-This way.

07:09.301 --> 07:11.660
It looks like the temple
could be over there.

07:11.661 --> 07:12.661
Are you OK, Cole?

07:15.261 --> 07:16.820
Smooth, Kurt.

07:16.821 --> 07:17.981
We're good.

07:19.461 --> 07:20.581
I think this is our man.

07:21.581 --> 07:22.900
No?
-No, no.

07:22.901 --> 07:25.500
We've got to go
to Pura Enjung Galuh Temple.

07:25.501 --> 07:27.780
We've got to go secondly
to Tanah Lot.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.060
Where's that temple?
-I don't know.

07:29.061 --> 07:30.660
We'll just get up and go back up.

07:30.661 --> 07:33.100
Mom, those have got to be the monks
on the beach.

07:33.101 --> 07:34.580
OK, I'll follow you, Cole.

07:34.581 --> 07:37.581
(ALL CHANT)

07:42.581 --> 07:45.461
Is this the Pura Enjung Galuh?

07:49.861 --> 07:51.940
Pura Enjung Galuh? Go that way?

07:51.941 --> 07:54.341
Right by where we were, dude.

07:57.261 --> 07:58.701
Here come the other teams. Let's go.

08:00.861 --> 08:02.581
Be safe today.

08:04.181 --> 08:05.181
Ooh, careful!

08:05.182 --> 08:07.500
This is not easy.
We can't find a temple.

08:07.501 --> 08:08.980
Do we start here?
-No.

08:08.981 --> 08:11.580
Go back where you started,
follow the arrows on the floor.

08:11.581 --> 08:13.581
But on the bright side,
you guys look fantastic.

08:15.501 --> 08:17.340
Here we go.
Oh, there it is.

08:17.341 --> 08:19.380
The temple that we needed
to take it to was literally...

08:19.381 --> 08:20.700
Five feet.

08:20.701 --> 08:21.860
..20 yards, if that,

08:21.861 --> 08:23.540
from the original place
where we picked it up.

08:23.541 --> 08:24.541
It was so close.

08:24.542 --> 08:26.461
Oh, man,
we totally screwed that one up.

08:28.261 --> 08:29.621
Oh, there you guys are.
-Thank you.

08:32.461 --> 08:34.621
This is awful.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.929
Oh, perfect.

08:37.931 --> 08:39.620
Yeah.

08:39.621 --> 08:40.900
Perfect.
-Oh, my gosh.

08:40.900 --> 08:42.140
You're good.
-Ah!

08:42.140 --> 08:43.980
Oh, I get the big one?
-You get the big one!

08:43.981 --> 08:45.900
Oh, my...

08:45.901 --> 08:48.100
Ah!

08:48.101 --> 08:49.101
Good?

08:49.102 --> 08:50.860
Thank you. -Alright,
we're going back to those guys.

08:50.861 --> 08:53.660
Are we sure? This guy is monstrous!

08:53.661 --> 08:57.930
I got the hugest snake
just chilling right now.

08:57.931 --> 08:59.660
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
Korey.

08:59.661 --> 09:01.460
Oh, my God.
-Korey, focus.

09:01.461 --> 09:03.580
OK, got it? Oh, my gosh.

09:03.581 --> 09:05.260
No, not yet, not yet.
-Holy cow.

09:05.261 --> 09:06.580
Now I got it.
-You got it?

09:06.581 --> 09:08.020
Yep.
-OK.

09:08.021 --> 09:10.300
Ty, you think it's just right here?

09:10.301 --> 09:12.100
You think that's Pura Enjung?
-Yes.

09:12.101 --> 09:14.580
Oh, he's coming after me!

09:14.581 --> 09:16.300
Great, he's moving.

09:16.301 --> 09:17.780
I mean, this is where the boys went.

09:17.781 --> 09:19.260
Is this Pura Enjung?

09:19.261 --> 09:20.580
Yes.

09:20.581 --> 09:21.980
Wrong way.

09:21.981 --> 09:23.540
Wow.

09:23.541 --> 09:25.050
Yes!

09:25.051 --> 09:26.660
Oh... my God.

09:26.661 --> 09:29.020
This is so cool.

09:29.021 --> 09:30.380
Thank you.

09:30.381 --> 09:32.930
Oh, honey, I'm fine with a snake.
I'm not worried about a snake.

09:32.931 --> 09:34.860
We've got this.

09:34.861 --> 09:37.501
Oh, my God. No.

09:40.101 --> 09:44.170
We're putting a big, old snake on us
and I don't like it.

09:44.171 --> 09:47.100
Oh, my gosh. Cole, you're so lucky.

09:47.101 --> 09:49.660
Oh... Cole, that's beautiful.

09:49.661 --> 09:51.810
Do I hold his head?
-Yeah, hold his head.

09:51.811 --> 09:53.980
Come on.
-Let's go, Mom.

09:53.981 --> 09:56.100
You guys are well fed, right?
-Hey, little buddy.

09:56.101 --> 09:58.220
Aw.
Are we supposed to hold them?

09:58.221 --> 09:59.780
Oh, I'm just supporting the head,
you know...

09:59.781 --> 10:01.341
Yeah.
-..like a baby.

10:02.341 --> 10:05.140
(GASPS) Thank you.

10:05.141 --> 10:07.660
Oh, my...!

10:07.661 --> 10:09.170
Where's its head, Ty?

10:09.171 --> 10:12.380
Mine's in my armpit and I know it.
And I know it.

10:12.381 --> 10:13.900
Where's his...? Oh, my God.

10:13.901 --> 10:15.700
Korey, power walk.

10:15.701 --> 10:16.900
You know what?

10:16.901 --> 10:18.170
Ooh!

10:18.171 --> 10:20.621
Oh, my God. Is it on my neck?

10:22.021 --> 10:23.930
Come on, Cole.
-I'm coming!

10:23.931 --> 10:25.341
Speed walk it, baby.

10:27.221 --> 10:30.780
I am serving
<i>I'm A Slave 4 U</i> realness,

10:30.781 --> 10:33.661
giving you Britney Spears
meets Bali.

10:36.421 --> 10:38.700
You've got your snake, bro.
This is a huge snake.

10:38.701 --> 10:40.420
Oh, please, get this thing off me.

10:40.421 --> 10:42.380
Yes!
-Please get this thing off me.

10:42.381 --> 10:43.381
Nice. Dude, nice work, Kurt.

10:43.382 --> 10:44.620
Ah, bite you.

10:44.621 --> 10:46.700
Ah! Oh, my neck.

10:46.701 --> 10:47.740
Here, a clue, Kurt.

10:47.741 --> 10:49.020
Ah, thank you!

10:49.021 --> 10:51.420
"Search for your next clue
approximately one half-kilometre

10:51.421 --> 10:56.740
"past the Bat Temple
on Banjar Balitong Kusamba."

10:56.741 --> 10:59.340
Alright, let's go.
-It's got to be this way, yeah?

10:59.341 --> 11:00.500
So, wait, I see the boys.

11:00.501 --> 11:03.500
Is y'all's snake turning his head
towards your face?

11:03.501 --> 11:04.620
Oh, my God.

11:04.621 --> 11:06.420
I cannot believe I am doing this

11:06.421 --> 11:08.380
and I don't like it.

11:08.381 --> 11:09.580
I love my snake.

11:09.581 --> 11:10.821
An offering for you.

11:12.301 --> 11:13.301
Hello.
(LAUGHS)

11:13.302 --> 11:15.100
Hello. Oh, my God.
Snake for you.

11:15.101 --> 11:17.460
Oh, my God. Get it off!

11:17.461 --> 11:19.900
I want to cry. What's mine doing?

11:19.901 --> 11:24.180
(LAUGHS)
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

11:24.181 --> 11:25.820
The Bat Temple,
do you know where that is?

11:25.821 --> 11:26.821
Um, yeah.

11:26.822 --> 11:28.780
Oh, is that the boys?

11:28.781 --> 11:30.140
OK, let's go.
-Where's your car?

11:30.141 --> 11:32.100
We had a 15-minute head start

11:32.101 --> 11:34.580
and again,
we just didn't read the clue

11:34.581 --> 11:37.820
and so we pretty much just lost
our whole entire lead.

11:37.821 --> 11:40.460
Oh, my God, I hated that snake.

11:40.461 --> 11:42.860
Mine was choking me out. Ugh!

11:42.861 --> 11:45.460
Oh, is that the temple
over there, Rach?

11:45.461 --> 11:46.540
These two dudes right here?

11:46.541 --> 11:47.900
Over here?
-Got to be.

11:47.901 --> 11:48.981
Of course.

11:53.581 --> 11:55.860
Oh, my gosh.
-Oh!

11:55.861 --> 11:57.821
I hate snakes so much.

12:03.761 --> 12:05.450
Ah! (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

12:05.475 --> 12:07.794
Oh, great. Yeah. Oh, boy!

12:07.795 --> 12:10.274
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

12:10.275 --> 12:11.474
(SCREAMS)

12:11.475 --> 12:14.954
Oh, Rach, get the head away from me.

12:14.955 --> 12:16.634
Oh, my gosh!

12:16.635 --> 12:18.834
Get away from me.

12:18.835 --> 12:20.234
He's really strong.

12:20.235 --> 12:21.514
This guy is so strong.

12:21.515 --> 12:23.115
I'm freaking out.

12:25.315 --> 12:26.435
Oh, nice.

12:28.195 --> 12:29.434
Rach, control and run.

12:29.435 --> 12:30.714
Come on.

12:30.715 --> 12:32.474
I'm trying. My arm.
-Just hold it.

12:32.475 --> 12:34.514
Hold it tight
or it'll suffocate you.

12:34.515 --> 12:36.074
You think it's that temple?
'Cause...

12:36.075 --> 12:37.434
Yeah.
-OK.

12:37.435 --> 12:39.514
(SCREAMS)
-You got it, Rach.

12:39.515 --> 12:40.634
Be the boss of it.

12:40.635 --> 12:43.594
(LAUGHS)
-Oh, all over me.

12:43.595 --> 12:44.674
Almost there, babe.

12:44.675 --> 12:46.474
I've lost control of it.

12:46.475 --> 12:47.795
I don't like this at all.

12:49.795 --> 12:51.315
We love you, snake.

12:52.315 --> 12:53.754
OK.

12:53.755 --> 12:54.954
Thank you.

12:54.955 --> 12:56.794
Making friends with the snake.

12:56.795 --> 12:58.074
Thank you.
-Thank you.

12:58.075 --> 13:00.074
Thank you.

13:00.075 --> 13:01.274
Thank you very much.

13:01.275 --> 13:03.194
Oh, my God!

13:03.195 --> 13:05.115
(SCREAMS)

13:09.715 --> 13:10.914
What are you thinking?

13:10.915 --> 13:12.434
Past the Bat Temple, right?

13:12.435 --> 13:14.274
Do you think it's on this street?

13:14.275 --> 13:16.754
Ash, come on. We're going this way.
Half a kilometre.

13:16.755 --> 13:19.594
Past would be this way, Brodie.

13:19.595 --> 13:20.754
You guys, how cool is this?

13:20.755 --> 13:22.314
Everyone's right there.

13:22.315 --> 13:24.274
Hey, there's the marker.
Hey, Brodie, come on.

13:24.275 --> 13:26.235
(CAR HORNS BLARE)
-There it is.

13:28.595 --> 13:29.834
BOTH: "Roadblock."

13:29.835 --> 13:34.314
The people of Bali have been making
this highly sought-after salt

13:34.315 --> 13:35.994
for thousands of years.

13:35.995 --> 13:38.034
<i>Teams must first collect seawater</i>

13:38.035 --> 13:41.514
<i>and pour it onto beds
of black volcanic sand</i>

13:41.515 --> 13:43.074
<i>so the water can evaporate.</i>

13:43.075 --> 13:46.394
<i>They'll then make their way
to the hollowed coconut trees</i>

13:46.395 --> 13:49.355
<i>where the resulting salt brine
has been brought to crystallise.</i>

13:50.595 --> 13:53.554
Once they've scraped enough salt
to fill up four bags,

13:53.555 --> 13:54.794
they'll receive their next clue.

13:54.795 --> 13:56.674
What do you think?

13:56.675 --> 13:58.194
It's your call.

13:58.195 --> 14:00.034
I have no idea.

14:00.035 --> 14:01.794
I'm doing the Roadblock.
-Kurt's doing it.

14:01.795 --> 14:03.674
Brodie didn't seem very confident,
and so I'm just like,

14:03.675 --> 14:05.314
"You know what? Let me just go
try bang this out."

14:05.315 --> 14:07.234
Salt work might be you.
-Yeah, OK, I'll do it.

14:07.235 --> 14:08.674
"Who's worth their salt?"
-Me.

14:08.675 --> 14:09.994
There's our Speed Bump.

14:09.995 --> 14:11.274
Gosh! Got to go back
to the Bat Temple.

14:11.275 --> 14:13.234
Sheri and Cole
will need to figure out

14:13.235 --> 14:16.834
that this man on a motorbike
offers meals on wheels.

14:16.835 --> 14:18.114
After waving him down,

14:18.115 --> 14:22.034
<i>they'll need to prepare and sell
10 breakfasts like this</i>

14:22.035 --> 14:25.394
<i>and then eat one themselves
before they can continue racing.</i>

14:25.395 --> 14:28.235
Alright, let's go.

14:36.075 --> 14:37.474
Alright, I'm claiming this one.

14:37.475 --> 14:38.634
You got this, Ty.

14:38.635 --> 14:40.914
Hey, Ash, I've got a good plot,
I've got a good plot.

14:40.915 --> 14:42.674
Great.
-Is this the demonstration, Kurt?

14:42.675 --> 14:43.874
Yeah.

14:43.875 --> 14:45.114
So, you just, like, shake it?

14:45.115 --> 14:50.434
It appears that Tyler has to wet
this plot of sand

14:50.435 --> 14:53.034
and it looks like
a lot of manual labour.

14:53.035 --> 14:54.234
Let's just get it done.

14:54.235 --> 14:58.074
I think this is just part
one of the Roadblock.

14:58.075 --> 15:01.195
Kurt. What are we doing?
-I don't know.

15:02.195 --> 15:03.594
Yeah, Kurt!

15:03.595 --> 15:05.115
Slow and steady, boy.

15:06.315 --> 15:07.715
(GRUNTS)

15:09.675 --> 15:10.675
Oh, my God.

15:11.675 --> 15:13.594
Tyler, did you get a lot?
-No.

15:13.595 --> 15:15.834
Yeah, neither did I.
He's got a lot more than us.

15:15.835 --> 15:17.074
We'll do one, we'll figure it out.

15:17.075 --> 15:20.114
The other guy has so much
more water than them.

15:20.115 --> 15:22.354
It's 'cause it is probably
heavy as heck. -Yeah.

15:22.355 --> 15:25.474
This guy is a freaking champ
and a half.

15:25.475 --> 15:27.554
You definitely want to try to get it

15:27.555 --> 15:30.315
when the water is still
and not rushing back out.

15:31.955 --> 15:33.315
'Cause that will only...

15:34.675 --> 15:36.794
(GRUNTS) ..aggravate your situation.

15:36.795 --> 15:39.354
Yeah, Kurt. (CLAPS)

15:39.355 --> 15:41.474
Salt that sand, boy!

15:41.475 --> 15:44.074
Salt that sand!

15:44.075 --> 15:46.674
I am so glad
that he is doing this one.

15:46.675 --> 15:49.194
I think he's got the strength
and endurance for it.

15:49.195 --> 15:50.714
I think we made the right choice
on this one.

15:50.715 --> 15:51.715
Yep.

15:51.716 --> 15:54.314
Nice job, Tyler!

15:54.315 --> 15:56.474
Oh, my God.
-Do a little shimmy, yeah.

15:56.475 --> 15:58.234
A little shimmy and shake.

15:58.235 --> 16:00.235
Yeah! Yeah!

16:02.315 --> 16:03.514
He's loving it! Look.

16:03.515 --> 16:05.834
The salt master's loving
that technique.

16:05.835 --> 16:07.795
He said that's exactly
how you do it.

16:10.595 --> 16:11.754
Oh, Mom, here!
-You see it?

16:11.755 --> 16:15.474
Hey! We've got to prepare
and sell 10 for 10,000 rupees each.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.834
Got it.
-We need you. Stop.

16:16.835 --> 16:19.074
Is he going to show us how to do it?
-OK, how do we make it?

16:19.075 --> 16:21.434
A pinch of salad.

16:21.435 --> 16:23.114
A pinch of green.

16:23.115 --> 16:24.834
A little bit of that.

16:24.835 --> 16:25.914
Chilli.

16:25.915 --> 16:27.474
And the meatballs.

16:27.475 --> 16:28.714
And then some broth.

16:28.715 --> 16:30.434
Alright, we've got to prepare
and sell 10 of those.

16:30.435 --> 16:32.754
OK. And we have to eat one. OK.
We can do that.

16:32.755 --> 16:34.954
COLE: It was a strange breakfast.
It looked more like a dinner

16:34.955 --> 16:36.994
'cause it was, like, the lettuce
and then slimy noodles...

16:36.995 --> 16:38.234
SHERI: Like green noodles.

16:38.235 --> 16:40.694
And then like more lettuce and then
sauces and then the meatballs

16:40.695 --> 16:41.754
and the broth.

16:41.755 --> 16:43.954
These meatballs... I don't know
what they were.

16:43.955 --> 16:45.234
I don't think they're meatballs.

16:45.235 --> 16:46.554
OK, we're good?

16:46.555 --> 16:48.794
OK, let's go sell these.

16:48.795 --> 16:50.954
10,000 rupees. You want some?

16:50.955 --> 16:53.234
10,000?
-10,000. -Uh-huh.

16:53.235 --> 16:54.794
Thank you.
-10,000.

16:54.795 --> 16:55.795
Here you go.

16:57.635 --> 16:59.194
Thank you so much.
-Enjoy.

16:59.195 --> 17:00.554
Alright, let's go
make some more, Mom.

17:00.555 --> 17:02.274
Go, go, go. OK. Again.

17:02.275 --> 17:04.355
It's going to be really hard
to eat this.

17:05.395 --> 17:06.875
My technique is take what you can...

17:08.355 --> 17:10.554
Not too much 'cause you'll drop it.

17:10.555 --> 17:11.954
As I drop it.

17:11.954 --> 17:13.674
Arm workout,

17:13.675 --> 17:16.394
shoulder workout, huge leg workout.

17:16.395 --> 17:18.503
I think he has the technique down.
He knows what he's doing.

17:18.505 --> 17:21.354
He's doing pretty good. I'm pretty
happy with Kurt right now.

17:21.355 --> 17:23.223
Kurt has definitely been
kind of carrying the team

17:23.224 --> 17:24.834
so far in the Roadblocks...

17:24.835 --> 17:26.874
Oh, that's a lot of water.

17:26.875 --> 17:29.874
..but Kurt has always been
the strongest competitor.

17:29.875 --> 17:30.875
Yeah, Kurt!

17:30.876 --> 17:32.744
Slow and steady, boy.

17:32.745 --> 17:35.714
I was diagnosed at 22
with stage III colon cancer.

17:35.715 --> 17:38.634
I had to undergo six months
of chemotherapy treatments

17:38.635 --> 17:41.154
and I've been a cancer survivor
for seven years.

17:41.155 --> 17:43.154
Yeah, Kurt!
He is crushing this right now.

17:43.155 --> 17:46.194
He's only gotten stronger
and better ever since,

17:46.195 --> 17:49.634
and so it's definitely something
that shows his tenacity,

17:49.635 --> 17:50.674
shows his toughness

17:50.675 --> 17:53.074
and that's something
that's big for us on this race.

17:53.075 --> 17:55.354
Yeah, boy! Yeah, boy!

17:55.355 --> 17:58.194
I think this one's going to take
a long time.

17:58.195 --> 17:59.794
This is backbreaking labour.

17:59.795 --> 18:01.554
Matt's going to do
and Zach's going to do it.

18:01.555 --> 18:02.834
"Who is worth her salt?"

18:02.835 --> 18:03.984
Worth their salt.
-I am.

18:03.985 --> 18:05.634
You're worth your salt? OK.

18:05.635 --> 18:06.874
Good luck, baby. Read your clue.

18:06.875 --> 18:08.224
(GASPS)

18:08.225 --> 18:09.745
Oh, no, I think Rachel's doing it.

18:10.955 --> 18:12.594
Oh, she's doing it.

18:12.595 --> 18:14.795
Oh, God, they should've just
walked and taken up a peek.

18:15.985 --> 18:18.554
Who's doing it? Rachel?
-Rachel's doing it.

18:18.555 --> 18:19.744
Ouch.

18:19.745 --> 18:22.714
You got it, baby.
-This looks hard.

18:22.715 --> 18:23.744
What do they have to do?

18:23.745 --> 18:26.834
So, she's got to carry these loads
of salt water up from the beach.

18:26.835 --> 18:28.594
Oh, no.
-Like, take them down, fill them

18:28.595 --> 18:31.034
and she has to shake them out.
Like, water the entire plot.

18:31.035 --> 18:32.874
Poor baby.
-(GRUNTS)

18:32.875 --> 18:34.874
I feel so bad for Rachel.
-It's so heavy.

18:34.875 --> 18:36.715
Looks like I should have
done this one.

18:38.901 --> 18:40.420
Almost done.

18:40.421 --> 18:42.020
We're killing it.

18:42.021 --> 18:43.780
They're loving our food. (LAUGHS)

18:43.781 --> 18:47.260
10,000. -10,000.
It's 10,000. -Yes, yes, yes.

18:47.261 --> 18:50.330
10,000.
-Thank you so much. Thank you.

18:50.331 --> 18:52.220
OK, now we've just got to eat ours.
Ooh.

18:52.221 --> 18:54.420
OK, I can't believe I'm doing this.

18:54.421 --> 18:55.740
Thank you.
-Come on.

18:55.741 --> 18:58.900
I do not cook like this at home.
-You've made spaghetti before.

18:58.901 --> 19:00.060
Eat that.

19:00.061 --> 19:01.701
We've got to do this.

19:03.061 --> 19:04.090
Oh, my God.

19:04.091 --> 19:05.381
This is spicy?

19:07.221 --> 19:09.300
(COUGHS)

19:09.301 --> 19:11.940
Don't let my future girlfriend see
this episode.

19:11.941 --> 19:13.541
Aah!

19:14.851 --> 19:17.020
It's hot.
(SPEAKS LOCAL LANGUAGE)

19:17.021 --> 19:18.021
Whoo!

19:18.022 --> 19:19.090
You eat the big meatballs

19:19.091 --> 19:20.980
then I'll try to down
the little one, OK?

19:20.981 --> 19:24.580
I'm afraid of what
kind of meat this is.

19:24.581 --> 19:27.060
Is it goat testicle?
(LAUGHS)

19:27.061 --> 19:28.501
Wow.

19:29.461 --> 19:31.420
First of all,
it was like 100 degrees outside.

19:31.421 --> 19:34.660
And now we're just having this hot,
goat testicle soup.

19:34.661 --> 19:37.260
And it is burning our mouths
like crazy.

19:37.261 --> 19:40.330
Done. -OK. Cole,
we go back now. -Let's go.

19:40.331 --> 19:42.740
Poor neutered goats everywhere.
I think we're still in it, Mom.

19:42.741 --> 19:43.741
We did that fast.

19:43.742 --> 19:45.300
I don't ever want to know
what we just ate.

19:45.301 --> 19:46.461
(BELCHES)
Oh, God.

19:48.541 --> 19:50.460
Oh, I can feel my sunburn.

19:50.461 --> 19:52.140
Good job, Rach.

19:52.141 --> 19:53.420
Focus on the game.

19:53.421 --> 19:54.580
Ooh.

19:54.581 --> 19:56.820
RACHEL: For me not having much upper
body strength,

19:56.821 --> 19:58.330
I was just struggling.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.460
I can't carry
that much water at a time.

20:00.461 --> 20:01.780
(GRUNTS)

20:01.781 --> 20:03.060
The guys are able to carry
huge loads.

20:03.061 --> 20:04.820
She's carrying,
like, quarter loads up

20:04.821 --> 20:07.140
so this is going to be a while.

20:07.141 --> 20:08.141
It's so heavy.

20:09.741 --> 20:10.900
How is Burnie doing?

20:10.901 --> 20:12.091
Burnie's looks drenched.

20:13.221 --> 20:14.701
OK, Judge.

20:16.181 --> 20:18.060
Good!

20:18.061 --> 20:20.260
(CHEERS) High five up top.
Thank you so much.

20:20.261 --> 20:21.420
Burnie got it.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.220
Nice job, Burnie.

20:23.221 --> 20:25.060
"You may proceed to the brine
troughs."

20:25.061 --> 20:27.180
OK, we've got
to find the brine troughs.

20:27.181 --> 20:28.260
Here we go, brine troughs.

20:28.261 --> 20:30.020
I'll take this one right here.
I'll take this one.

20:30.021 --> 20:31.980
There it is, Kurt. There it is.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.981
OK, Judge! Judge.

20:35.781 --> 20:36.980
(CHEERING)

20:36.981 --> 20:38.300
Thank you, sir.

20:38.301 --> 20:40.420
Oh, my God. (GRUNTS)

20:40.421 --> 20:42.091
(GRUNTS)

20:43.091 --> 20:46.940
So, right now we're scraping salt
after we took a bunch of salt water

20:46.941 --> 20:48.820
and put it up to dry out.

20:48.821 --> 20:51.540
They get salt like this in a trough
and then they scrape it out

20:51.541 --> 20:53.090
and farm all the salt.

20:53.091 --> 20:54.940
Right now,
I'm basically racing against Kurt,

20:54.941 --> 20:57.740
who traditionally doesn't do
that well, so...

20:57.741 --> 21:00.460
He only has about half
the first-place finishes

21:00.461 --> 21:01.700
so far in the race.

21:01.701 --> 21:02.780
Good job, Ty.

21:02.781 --> 21:04.780
I really wish
I would have done this.

21:04.781 --> 21:05.851
Me too.

21:07.141 --> 21:09.611
(GRUNTS)
I hope Dana does it, otherwise...

21:12.901 --> 21:14.981
You want me to do it?
-OK. Cole's going to do it.

21:16.661 --> 21:17.780
Cole's doing it.

21:17.781 --> 21:19.220
Cole can crush this.

21:19.221 --> 21:20.900
I hope Dana picks it.

21:20.901 --> 21:23.060
"Who is worth their salt?" I am.

21:23.061 --> 21:24.061
Good job, babe.

21:26.611 --> 21:28.850
It looks nice and wet.
-Oh, so wet.

21:28.851 --> 21:30.581
Lots of salt.
-(CHEERING)

21:31.901 --> 21:32.980
Oh, my God.

21:32.981 --> 21:35.420
Good job, sweetie.
You're doing great.

21:35.421 --> 21:37.820
Rachel, you are doing a good job!

21:37.821 --> 21:38.940
Is she the only girl?

21:38.941 --> 21:40.261
Only girl.

21:42.581 --> 21:44.850
Holy crap. (GRUNTS)

21:44.851 --> 21:47.300
Think of that as Margarita salt.

21:47.301 --> 21:49.061
Oh! I would kill for Margarita.

21:50.381 --> 21:53.900
All I want is a Margarita skinny.

21:53.901 --> 21:57.220
With salt all around that rim.
Frozen.

21:57.221 --> 21:59.060
Good? Good.

21:59.061 --> 22:00.620
Almost done, dude.
Slow and steady, boy.

22:00.621 --> 22:02.060
This?

22:02.061 --> 22:04.100
I've got to fill
these four bags with salt.

22:04.101 --> 22:05.900
It's good! Alright, great.
Great, thank you.

22:05.901 --> 22:07.420
Good job, sweetie, good job.

22:07.421 --> 22:09.220
So this is our common salt pile?
-Yeah.

22:09.221 --> 22:10.900
This is way harder than it looks.

22:10.901 --> 22:14.300
You have to look at how it's tied
and you've got to match that.

22:14.301 --> 22:16.340
Baby, you're going to get
the saltiest kiss after this.

22:16.341 --> 22:17.700
Yeah!

22:17.701 --> 22:20.340
Brodie, you're going to get...
Nothing.

22:20.341 --> 22:21.540
Good job, sweetie.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.500
You're doing so much better
than I would have done.

22:23.501 --> 22:26.980
You're killing it.
-Cole's carrying so much water

22:26.981 --> 22:30.060
every load and Rachel is losing it
by the time she comes up here,

22:30.061 --> 22:33.060
so I'm just hoping she stay strong.

22:33.061 --> 22:35.861
Yeah! Yeah!

22:36.861 --> 22:38.860
Ash, get ready.

22:38.861 --> 22:40.100
OK!

22:40.101 --> 22:42.060
Hey, hey, these are for you. Good?

22:43.901 --> 22:46.340
More? Some more on this one? OK.

22:46.341 --> 22:47.740
They want to treat
their customers right.

22:47.741 --> 22:49.500
You get a light bag of salt,
you lose a customer.

22:49.501 --> 22:50.780
Good job, sweetie.

22:50.781 --> 22:54.580
So glad he's doing it because
I wouldn't have been strong enough.

22:54.581 --> 22:57.900
Oh, you got a lot that time.
Great job. So fast.

22:57.901 --> 22:59.301
Who do I check to see if it's done?

23:04.501 --> 23:06.860
Yay, good job, Cole.
-Good.

23:06.861 --> 23:09.340
I'm sorry, babe.
-Focus on your own game here.

23:09.341 --> 23:11.340
Cole just crushed that.

23:11.341 --> 23:12.900
You're doing awesome.

23:12.901 --> 23:14.421
Cole finished before Rachel.

23:15.661 --> 23:16.661
Yeah, that was a bad choice.

23:16.662 --> 23:17.861
OK, check.

23:21.941 --> 23:23.701
OK.
-Good job, baby.

23:24.901 --> 23:26.700
Oh, no.

23:26.701 --> 23:27.780
Oh, gosh. Oh.

23:27.781 --> 23:29.100
She's losing it.

23:29.101 --> 23:30.180
She is losing it.

23:30.181 --> 23:31.181
She's going to pass out.

23:31.182 --> 23:33.380
I can't, babe. Oh, Zach.

23:33.381 --> 23:34.821
This is freaking ridiculous.

23:37.882 --> 23:39.761
You're awesome, babe. You got it.

23:39.762 --> 23:42.482
I can feel my skin getting
sunburned.

23:44.162 --> 23:45.162
My back hurts.

23:45.163 --> 23:48.361
RACHEL: When I saw the guys
finishing, it was hard.

23:48.362 --> 23:52.201
I was just drained and so I think
I was fighting not just, like, cry.

23:52.202 --> 23:54.521
You're almost done.

23:54.522 --> 23:55.721
Good job, sweetie. Good job.

23:55.722 --> 23:57.361
Here you go.

23:57.362 --> 23:58.402
Good?

24:00.722 --> 24:03.922
Oh, so great!
-Oh, my God. Burnie crushed it.

24:05.162 --> 24:08.081
"Make your way to Pantai Mertasari.
Search for your next clue."

24:08.082 --> 24:09.801
Let's go search for the clue.
-Let's go.

24:09.802 --> 24:10.881
Let's go. Thanks.

24:10.882 --> 24:12.121
Good job, Cole.

24:12.122 --> 24:14.881
Just like at Milky Moo's
with the ice-cream scooping.

24:14.882 --> 24:18.401
COLE: I used to work at Milky Moo's
back in Troy, Alabama.

24:18.402 --> 24:21.361
I know how to scoop ice-cream, so I
was like, "Man, I can do this."

24:21.362 --> 24:23.322
OK. There we go.

24:26.162 --> 24:27.162
Oh, my God.

24:27.163 --> 24:29.201
Can I get a new bag? Oops.

24:29.202 --> 24:30.961
Oh, man.

24:30.962 --> 24:32.321
What are you doing, boy?

24:32.322 --> 24:35.201
He just busted a bag. Oh... no.

24:35.202 --> 24:36.202
Ah!

24:36.203 --> 24:39.161
I'm on my fourth bag of salt.
Tied them all up.

24:39.162 --> 24:41.041
I'm going to go see
if they're approved.

24:41.042 --> 24:44.081
Got those four good bags of salt.

24:44.082 --> 24:46.321
Yeah! Let's go.

24:46.322 --> 24:47.721
Bye. Good job, guys.

24:47.722 --> 24:49.361
You're doing a good job, Cole.

24:49.362 --> 24:51.241
Come on, baby, you got it.
-You got it, boy.

24:51.242 --> 24:52.242
Nice and easy, dude.

24:53.362 --> 24:56.001
This is definitely the hardest thing
that Rachel's probably done

24:56.002 --> 24:57.121
physically in her life.

24:57.122 --> 24:59.081
This is the hardest thing I would've
ever done in my life.

24:59.082 --> 25:00.481
You are killing it right now.

25:00.482 --> 25:02.241
You're doing so good, baby.

25:02.242 --> 25:03.441
Can I get checked?

25:03.442 --> 25:04.922
I'm hoping that it's right.

25:09.802 --> 25:10.921
Oh, thank you.

25:10.922 --> 25:12.481
Good job, baby.

25:12.482 --> 25:13.601
So proud of you.

25:13.602 --> 25:14.801
You can catch up to the boys.

25:14.802 --> 25:15.922
Good?

25:17.642 --> 25:18.961
She say no again?

25:18.962 --> 25:20.441
The tie just came untied.

25:20.442 --> 25:21.761
Oh, Rachel is done.

25:21.762 --> 25:23.641
Good job, Rachel.
-Let's go.

25:23.642 --> 25:25.681
This is your chance to speed up.

25:25.682 --> 25:27.762
The boys are still struggling, Rach.
Come on.

25:29.402 --> 25:30.921
There it is right there. I see it.
-Great.

25:30.922 --> 25:32.441
You ready for Detour?
-Let's kill a Detour.

25:32.442 --> 25:34.561
Alright,
that's a very full clue box.

25:34.562 --> 25:36.162
Yes! Awesome, wonderful.

25:37.242 --> 25:38.921
Oh!
BOTH: Roadblock.

25:38.922 --> 25:43.721
<i>PHIL: The annual Bali Kite Festival
is renowned for its giant kites.</i>

25:43.722 --> 25:50.241
Some of these monstrous designs
are 36ft wide and 1,000ft long.

25:50.242 --> 25:53.561
<i>First, teams have to build one
with a team of kite enthusiasts.</i>

25:53.562 --> 25:57.321
<i>Then,</i> it's time for teams
to go fly a kite.

25:57.322 --> 26:01.522
<i>If they can get it airborne,
they'll receive their next clue.</i>

26:03.242 --> 26:04.281
Alright.

26:04.282 --> 26:05.721
So, this is yours.
I'm doing this one.

26:05.722 --> 26:07.322
I assume it's going to be
kites out here.

26:08.722 --> 26:10.601
Oh, cool kites.
-Good luck, baby.

26:10.602 --> 26:11.602
Alright, what do I do?

26:11.603 --> 26:13.081
I need to build it?

26:13.082 --> 26:14.681
This is going to be a very big kite.

26:14.682 --> 26:16.001
I think it might be our leg.

26:16.002 --> 26:19.361
We know for a fact that Brodie will
have to do this challenge,

26:19.362 --> 26:21.481
not only because you have to switch
Roadblocks,

26:21.482 --> 26:23.401
but because
now Kurt's out of Roadblocks.

26:23.402 --> 26:25.921
He can't do any more.
OK, so this is the example.

26:25.922 --> 26:27.801
All we have to do is knock out
this Roadblock

26:27.802 --> 26:29.881
and this could be our first first.

26:29.882 --> 26:31.081
Fingers crossed.

26:31.082 --> 26:33.961
No, if you did the other one,
so this is me.

26:33.962 --> 26:37.001
So, this goes to the back.
-Come on, Ash! Love you, boo!

26:37.002 --> 26:38.521
This is a big old kite.

26:38.522 --> 26:41.121
Come on, Kor. Love you, boo.

26:41.122 --> 26:42.281
(LAUGHS)

26:42.282 --> 26:45.921
Take it all? Yeah. OK.

26:45.922 --> 26:47.361
Ooh, it is warm out.

26:47.362 --> 26:50.481
So, this needs to go on there
crosswise.

26:50.482 --> 26:53.601
Alright,
this is going to be complicated.

26:53.602 --> 26:55.681
It's really hard to tie
these knots right now.

26:55.682 --> 26:58.321
That's the hardest part.
-The hardest part, yeah.

26:58.322 --> 27:00.761
We got man hands over here.
It's a problem.

27:00.762 --> 27:02.961
Come on, Matt. You can do it.

27:02.962 --> 27:04.121
You're doing great, baby.

27:04.122 --> 27:05.881
I'd love to get off this beach.

27:05.882 --> 27:08.522
Why don't you guys use
your Express Pass?

27:09.682 --> 27:11.041
Slow and steady, dude.

27:11.042 --> 27:12.721
Let's go! Ahh!

27:12.722 --> 27:14.162
Come on.

27:15.962 --> 27:16.962
Good?

27:17.922 --> 27:20.081
Yes!

27:20.082 --> 27:21.961
Finally. That was the worst.

27:21.962 --> 27:24.001
Thank you so much.
OK, let's go, Brodie!

27:24.002 --> 27:25.601
Good? OK, thank you.

27:25.602 --> 27:27.241
Rachel, you got it, baby.

27:27.242 --> 27:28.281
Good job, Rachel.

27:28.282 --> 27:29.641
Go on, honey.

27:29.642 --> 27:31.321
This is your chance to catch
up here.

27:31.322 --> 27:33.761
Oh, man, this is tough.

27:33.762 --> 27:34.841
Come on, Cole!

27:34.842 --> 27:38.521
I've never gone to a mental
hospital for being crazy,

27:38.522 --> 27:41.281
but if it were,
it'd be for tying salt bags.

27:41.282 --> 27:42.921
There we go. In we go.

27:42.922 --> 27:44.041
Great job, baby!

27:44.042 --> 27:45.321
This one? Goes here.

27:45.322 --> 27:47.561
They must be lettered or...

27:47.562 --> 27:50.041
OK. A.

27:50.042 --> 27:51.641
Good job, Kor.

27:51.642 --> 27:52.642
OK.

27:54.002 --> 27:55.241
A.

27:55.242 --> 27:57.001
Let's find B.

27:57.002 --> 27:59.361
B.
-Don't see any other teams, yet.

27:59.362 --> 28:00.921
I know.

28:00.922 --> 28:03.801
Oh, shoot. This is so hard.

28:03.802 --> 28:06.002
Good job, Cole.
-Come on, Matt.

28:07.242 --> 28:09.442
Hey, hey. Oh, hi.

28:15.522 --> 28:17.841
Yes!
Good job, Cole. -Thank you.

28:17.842 --> 28:20.082
Come on, Matt. You can do this.

28:21.122 --> 28:22.401
Good?

28:22.402 --> 28:24.321
Whoo! Thank you so much.
-Good job, baby.

28:24.322 --> 28:26.161
Come on, let's get out of here.
-Good luck, Rachel.

28:26.162 --> 28:28.121
We still got it. We're still in.

28:28.122 --> 28:30.081
I'm currently in last place.

28:30.082 --> 28:31.881
I'm just hoping I can tie these.

28:31.882 --> 28:34.202
Baby, good job. Keep going, baby.

28:35.322 --> 28:39.441
Right now,
I'm doing kind of the tail.

28:39.442 --> 28:41.681
I'm never going to be satisfied with
normal kites now.

28:41.682 --> 28:46.081
I'm feeling good about the progress
I'm making, although...

28:46.082 --> 28:48.481
So, Brodie is doing every
Roadblock from now on.

28:48.482 --> 28:50.041
He has to, right?
-He has to.

28:50.042 --> 28:51.441
Oh, it's right here, dude.

28:51.442 --> 28:53.041
Go, go, go, go.

28:53.042 --> 28:54.401
Oh, it's another team.

28:54.402 --> 28:56.481
Roadblock?
-Oh, jeez, I'm doing this one.

28:56.482 --> 28:58.641
Oh, boy.
-Oh, it's Brodie.

28:58.642 --> 29:00.201
Oh, my God. It's a huge kite.

29:00.202 --> 29:02.201
(GRUNTS) What are we doing?

29:02.202 --> 29:03.522
What's first? These?

29:05.522 --> 29:07.442
You've got it, Brods.
-The example.

29:08.802 --> 29:10.841
(SIGHS) What the heck?

29:10.842 --> 29:12.241
You got it, Brodie?

29:12.242 --> 29:14.921
Well, they don't tell me
what the first step is.

29:14.922 --> 29:17.041
They don't tell you when
to do what, huh?

29:17.042 --> 29:19.241
OK.
Just take your time, you've got it.

29:19.242 --> 29:21.521
Set this down here.

29:21.522 --> 29:23.081
I've got to run to see the example,

29:23.082 --> 29:26.082
I thought we were building
this together!

29:27.722 --> 29:28.801
Good job, Rachey.

29:28.802 --> 29:30.122
OK.

29:32.882 --> 29:35.921
Just in case she approves it.
-OK.

29:35.922 --> 29:38.561
Oh, thank you.
-Good job, baby.

29:38.562 --> 29:41.041
Thank you.
-Let's go.

29:41.042 --> 29:42.482
You did so good.

29:44.122 --> 29:45.321
What the heck, man?

29:45.322 --> 29:46.841
This one goes on the outside?

29:46.842 --> 29:49.681
I better check the example,
really quickly.

29:49.682 --> 29:51.521
I'm not sure you want to be
looking at mine, Brodie.

29:51.522 --> 29:53.081
They don't really tell you
what you're doing.

29:53.082 --> 29:55.961
Is he cheating off you?
He's looking at yours?

29:55.962 --> 29:57.121
Yeah.

29:57.122 --> 29:59.001
ASHLEY: Brodie was consulting
frequently on my kite

29:59.002 --> 30:00.601
as the example,

30:00.602 --> 30:02.281
so, you know,
that's quite flattering.

30:02.282 --> 30:06.281
Brodie was probably missing
that Express Pass big time.

30:06.282 --> 30:08.641
So, let's just put this guy here.

30:08.642 --> 30:11.801
No.
-You've got it, Brodie!

30:11.802 --> 30:13.321
There we go.

30:13.322 --> 30:18.103
Now we got it, guys,
we're building a kite.

30:18.683 --> 30:21.202
Is that OK?
-I think not.

30:22.610 --> 30:25.685
What?! This way?

30:26.468 --> 30:29.307
Now go through. Good?

30:29.308 --> 30:31.227
OK, well, that was just awkward.

30:31.228 --> 30:32.347
This looks hard.

30:32.348 --> 30:34.467
I think Sheri
will get frustrated here.

30:34.468 --> 30:35.547
Yeah.

30:35.548 --> 30:37.427
I've got to perform this.
-Yeah, you've got it.

30:37.428 --> 30:39.467
OK, let's do it.
(CACKLING)

30:39.468 --> 30:40.987
Oh, gosh, what stress.

30:40.988 --> 30:42.267
Mom, this is right up your alley.

30:42.268 --> 30:43.827
Another team here.
-Who's running up?

30:43.828 --> 30:45.587
Cole and Sheri.
-Whoo!

30:45.588 --> 30:47.827
They've made up a ton of time today.

30:47.828 --> 30:49.387
Alright.
-You've got it.

30:49.388 --> 30:50.427
Oh, boy.

30:50.428 --> 30:52.787
So, I think I'm ready,
for my bow is in the middle.

30:52.788 --> 30:55.867
Boom. That's right for sure.

30:55.868 --> 30:58.267
Putting a head on the kite.

30:58.268 --> 30:59.787
Beautiful dragon head.

30:59.788 --> 31:01.987
They say example,
but it's like, where do you start?

31:01.988 --> 31:04.027
You got it, bro, just put your head
down and do it, Brodie.

31:04.028 --> 31:05.227
Yeah, it's a slow process, bro.

31:05.228 --> 31:07.428
Putting on the head of the dragon.

31:09.268 --> 31:11.227
Ashley's got her head on.

31:11.228 --> 31:13.227
She's a little bit ahead of me.

31:13.228 --> 31:16.267
What the heck, man?
This is a trial and error.

31:16.268 --> 31:18.987
KA2.

31:18.988 --> 31:20.547
Oh, they have numbers on them?

31:20.548 --> 31:22.148
My bad, my bad, my bad.

31:23.428 --> 31:25.587
You got it, Mom!

31:25.588 --> 31:27.787
I have no idea what I'm doing.

31:27.788 --> 31:30.107
I'm not a builder of any sort.

31:30.108 --> 31:33.307
I'm just going to try to do my best
and follow the example.

31:33.308 --> 31:35.227
Come on, Dana, you're good, babe.

31:35.228 --> 31:36.747
Tyler, the dragon's wearing a wig.

31:36.748 --> 31:38.347
We saw.

31:38.348 --> 31:40.668
The dragon looks like
one of Tyler's ex-boyfriends.

31:42.348 --> 31:45.787
What about this, is that good?
All the... ah. OK.

31:45.788 --> 31:47.627
Yeah, Mamma, go, Mamma!
I believe in you.

31:47.628 --> 31:50.787
OK. Two?

31:50.788 --> 31:52.787
I'm so dead.
-Dude, you killed it.

31:52.788 --> 31:54.707
That was probably the toughest
Roadblock so far.

31:54.708 --> 31:56.547
Zach and Rachel could be in trouble.
It's possible.

31:56.548 --> 32:00.547
But Zach is really, really good
at these kinds of Roadblocks.

32:00.548 --> 32:02.507
"Want to go fly a kite
if you perform the first..."

32:02.508 --> 32:04.787
OK, I could fly a kite.
This is awesome.

32:04.788 --> 32:06.227
Zach's here.
This is all you, babe.

32:06.228 --> 32:08.667
The kite's taking shape, finally.
-This is a big tail.

32:08.668 --> 32:11.627
Just tie it off.
I'm making the prettiest tail ever.

32:11.628 --> 32:13.387
It looks like a parachute.

32:13.388 --> 32:15.547
Zach's excited, he loves
flying kites.

32:15.548 --> 32:17.107
It's like, this is for Zach.

32:17.108 --> 32:20.067
You got it, babe, it's all you.
Yeah, it's going to be more perfect.

32:20.068 --> 32:21.308
Like a big Lego set.

32:22.868 --> 32:25.067
My tarp right here isn't under.

32:25.068 --> 32:26.667
It's stuck on this thing.

32:26.668 --> 32:29.948
We're doing well.
I do like to build things.

32:31.028 --> 32:33.947
I don't know what
this is supposed to do.

32:33.948 --> 32:35.787
OK, I'm just going to wing it.

32:35.788 --> 32:37.067
Good job, babe!

32:37.068 --> 32:38.827
OK, got it.

32:38.828 --> 32:41.187
ZACH: I love flying,
I've never built a kite like that,

32:41.188 --> 32:44.787
but just looking at the example
a few times, I got it.

32:44.788 --> 32:47.787
So in, in, out, in, in.
There, of course, duh.

32:47.788 --> 32:49.547
We're literally flying here.

32:49.548 --> 32:52.627
Yes, of course.
-Good job, Zach!

32:52.628 --> 32:55.187
Korey's is about to take off
right now.

32:55.188 --> 32:56.787
I think I'm getting close.

32:56.788 --> 32:58.467
Dang, Korey killing.

32:58.468 --> 33:00.067
I'm definitely getting close.

33:00.068 --> 33:02.827
Got a couple more knots and I've
got one that I need to correct.

33:02.828 --> 33:04.507
I can't wait to fly this thing.

33:04.508 --> 33:05.628
Ready to fly?

33:07.068 --> 33:08.227
Ready to fly.

33:08.228 --> 33:09.667
Dammit.

33:09.668 --> 33:10.907
OK.
-Get it, boy!

33:10.908 --> 33:13.267
Korey is absolutely killing it.

33:13.268 --> 33:15.587
Go, go, go.

33:15.588 --> 33:17.427
Yeah, Kore!

33:17.428 --> 33:19.587
We ready to fly? Yes!

33:19.588 --> 33:21.148
Great job, babe!
-OK.

33:22.388 --> 33:24.587
Here we go.

33:24.588 --> 33:26.388
Get it, Kore!

33:27.788 --> 33:29.707
(SCREAMS) Yes!

33:29.708 --> 33:34.787
(LAUGHS) Yes! Oh, my God.
-Wow.

33:34.788 --> 33:38.187
That tail is awesome.
-Yeah, Kore!

33:38.188 --> 33:40.787
Look how long that thing is.

33:40.788 --> 33:45.067
Oh, my God.
-Wow, that's beautiful.

33:45.068 --> 33:48.468
Oh, my God, get it! (SIGHS)

33:50.708 --> 33:53.707
That was really cool.
-That was incredible.

33:53.708 --> 33:56.507
That was awesome.

33:56.508 --> 33:59.107
"Make your way to Semawang Beach

33:59.108 --> 34:01.267
"and take an outrigger
to the next Pit Stop."

34:01.268 --> 34:05.187
<i>PHIL: Indonesia is made up of more
than 17,000 islands</i>

34:05.188 --> 34:08.107
and is blessed with what seems to be
an infinite number

34:08.108 --> 34:10.377
of spectacular beaches like this.

34:10.378 --> 34:14.827
The last team to find me on this
traditional Indonesian sailing boat

34:14.828 --> 34:16.467
may be eliminated.

34:16.467 --> 34:18.027
"The last team to check-in
may be eliminated."

34:18.027 --> 34:20.107
Let's go, we're getting first.
-You killed it.

34:20.108 --> 34:22.947
Whoo!
-Ash, you've got this!

34:22.947 --> 34:24.827
You're doing it, babe!

34:24.828 --> 34:27.987
Whoo! Whoo! Go, go!

34:27.987 --> 34:30.947
Whoo!
-Great job, baby.

34:30.947 --> 34:34.187
We're leaving the Roadblock
ahead of Burnie and Ashley.

34:34.188 --> 34:36.377
Right now it looks like
we're racing for number one.

34:36.378 --> 34:37.746
I think Brodie was struggling.

34:37.748 --> 34:40.067
I can't believe they didn't
use their Express Pass.

34:40.068 --> 34:42.107
Part of me thinks
they already used it.

34:42.108 --> 34:44.266
You think? That's not smart.

34:44.268 --> 34:45.786
That dragon looks sick.

34:45.788 --> 34:47.428
Where are we feeling next, guys?

34:48.947 --> 34:50.306
The example.

34:50.308 --> 34:51.587
Careful.
-You got it, Mom!

34:51.588 --> 34:52.987
What the heck?

34:52.987 --> 34:55.706
Come on, Dana, go, go, go!

34:55.708 --> 34:59.857
OK, the head. -Urgh, I can't
believe they did that so fast.

34:59.858 --> 35:01.747
And I was doing good.

35:01.748 --> 35:03.107
You got it, baby.

35:03.108 --> 35:06.107
Ty, you see a marked outrigger?
-Yeah, it's marked.

35:06.108 --> 35:08.667
Come on, we're ready. Let's go.

35:08.668 --> 35:10.148
One, two and go!

35:12.428 --> 35:14.627
Can we get in?

35:14.628 --> 35:16.707
This is it. -Alright, let's go,
let's find the outrigger canoe,

35:16.708 --> 35:18.027
we're in the right place, right?
-Yeah.

35:18.028 --> 35:19.857
Where are we paddling to?

35:19.858 --> 35:21.307
To there?

35:21.308 --> 35:22.747
Yeah, oh, my God.

35:22.748 --> 35:24.427
To the right,
it's that boat out there.

35:24.428 --> 35:25.467
Yeah!

35:25.468 --> 35:28.187
I don't see the boys,
unless they're in that boat.

35:28.188 --> 35:29.547
What boat?
-That sailboat.

35:29.548 --> 35:30.708
What a physical day.

35:31.988 --> 35:34.747
We're doing good.
-Getting a workout.

35:34.748 --> 35:37.027
Strong, together.

35:37.028 --> 35:38.948
Let's sail.
-Come on, let's go.

35:40.588 --> 35:43.307
Our friends,
we don't want to see them.

35:43.308 --> 35:44.788
Bye, friends.

35:46.628 --> 35:51.107
I feel like I'm getting close,
but my knots aren't tight enough.

35:51.108 --> 35:53.507
Sheri, are you making bows
or knots on these?

35:53.508 --> 35:55.467
Knots.
-Knots?

35:55.468 --> 35:58.708
My fingers are huge
and doing knots is difficult, so...

36:01.068 --> 36:03.027
..it's just one
of those challenges, you know?

36:03.028 --> 36:04.507
Come on, Brodie!

36:04.508 --> 36:06.947
I'm trying, bro.
-Cool.

36:06.948 --> 36:09.467
OK. Good?

36:09.468 --> 36:11.897
Good, good, good.
-Yes? OK.

36:11.898 --> 36:13.787
Oh, my God. This is unbelievable.

36:13.788 --> 36:16.107
How we doing, boys?

36:16.108 --> 36:18.857
Ready? Yeah. OK.
-Good job, babe.

36:18.858 --> 36:21.227
I think I'm getting close
to flying here.

36:21.228 --> 36:23.377
Good job, Zach! You're doing great!

36:23.378 --> 36:26.588
This goes on the outside
'cause it has to stretch. Simple.

36:28.588 --> 36:32.467
Yeah! Whoo! Whoo!

36:32.468 --> 36:34.827
Yeah! Go, Mamma!

36:34.828 --> 36:36.897
Yes, it does!

36:36.898 --> 36:38.187
That's it!

36:38.188 --> 36:40.107
You did so good.

36:40.108 --> 36:41.787
"The last team to check-in
may be eliminated."

36:41.788 --> 36:43.547
Let's go.
OK. Good job, Mom.

36:43.548 --> 36:45.857
Go, go, go, go!

36:45.858 --> 36:48.987
You got it, come on,
come on, come on!

36:48.988 --> 36:52.187
Whoo! You got it, babe.

36:52.188 --> 36:53.987
Thanks, guys.
-You did so good.

36:53.988 --> 36:55.857
"Last team to check-in
may be eliminated."

36:55.858 --> 36:59.707
Alright, good? Ready to fly?
-This is not good.

36:59.708 --> 37:02.827
Why's it not good? What's wrong?

37:02.828 --> 37:04.467
What the heck?

37:04.468 --> 37:06.508
Hold on. What's not good?

37:08.188 --> 37:10.507
This is definitely an opportunity
to make up some ground.

37:10.508 --> 37:12.467
I was doing good
until I got to these knots,

37:12.468 --> 37:14.427
apparently I tied them
in the wrong order.

37:14.428 --> 37:16.338
Argh! This is unbelievable.

37:24.858 --> 37:26.267
And then there were two.

37:26.268 --> 37:27.947
Best of luck.
-Yeah.

37:27.948 --> 37:29.947
I think he might've just tried
to go really fast

37:29.948 --> 37:31.267
and didn't do some
of the knots right.

37:31.268 --> 37:33.787
So, it's just kind of
a waiting game right now.

37:33.788 --> 37:36.947
It's frustrating, 'cause we were
ahead of everyone and we got passed

37:36.948 --> 37:38.337
and there goes first place.

37:38.338 --> 37:40.267
You got it, babe.

37:40.268 --> 37:42.787
Sorry I'm sweating on your kite.
(SIGHS)

37:42.788 --> 37:45.427
I don't think we wanted to be
the last two at any Roadblock,

37:45.428 --> 37:48.027
especially since this is the last
one before the Pit Stop,

37:48.028 --> 37:49.787
so, it's going to be really close.

37:49.788 --> 37:53.147
I think I'm like 75% done,
so almost there.

37:53.148 --> 37:55.068
Come on, Brodes.

37:56.108 --> 37:57.707
We're way out in front.
-We're doing good.

37:57.708 --> 37:59.667
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's Burnie and Ashley.

37:59.668 --> 38:02.107
Oh, man.
-We're getting there.

38:02.108 --> 38:03.587
This is it.

38:03.588 --> 38:06.857
We're close, dude, we're so close.

38:06.858 --> 38:08.427
Is it this boat?

38:08.428 --> 38:10.107
That's Phil! I see Phil!

38:10.108 --> 38:13.227
Hey, guess what?
You're team number one!

38:13.228 --> 38:14.827
Yes! (LAUGHS)

38:14.828 --> 38:16.828
Get on the boat!

38:18.858 --> 38:20.227
Good job, you guys.

38:20.228 --> 38:22.468
We're making you work
for this first place.

38:24.068 --> 38:27.227
BURNIE: Our fourth second place
in a row.

38:27.228 --> 38:29.428
ASHLEY: We're getting really
familiar with second place.

38:34.228 --> 38:35.827
Phil!

38:35.828 --> 38:38.187
We're a couple of pirates
here for your booty, Phil.

38:38.188 --> 38:40.147
(LAUGHS) Calm down.

38:40.148 --> 38:41.627
Right, now you're like
drunken sailors,

38:41.628 --> 38:42.857
the way we're rocking back
and forth.

38:42.858 --> 38:44.707
Welcome to Bali.

38:44.708 --> 38:45.897
BOTH: Thank you.

38:45.898 --> 38:47.747
As the winners of this leg
of the race,

38:47.748 --> 38:51.107
you have won $5,000 each.

38:51.108 --> 38:53.227
You're back where you wanted to be.

38:53.228 --> 38:55.107
We're back at number one.
-Fought our way back to the top.

38:55.108 --> 38:56.227
Going to stay at number one.

38:56.228 --> 38:59.147
Goodness, look, Burnie
and Ashley are coming in.

38:59.148 --> 39:02.147
Congratulations, you guys,
a very tight finish,

39:02.148 --> 39:03.627
you're team number two.

39:03.628 --> 39:06.107
Oh, again.
Fourth in a row.

39:06.108 --> 39:08.377
Fourth in a row.
-Good job.

39:08.378 --> 39:09.987
I see it.

39:09.988 --> 39:11.707
That has to be it up there.

39:11.708 --> 39:12.708
This is it. This is it, come on.

39:12.709 --> 39:14.187
Everything you've got,
this is the Pit Stop.

39:14.188 --> 39:15.388
Everything we've got. Come on.

39:19.148 --> 39:22.587
Ready? Good?
Ready, let's go, let's fly.

39:22.588 --> 39:23.787
Looks like Brodie's up next.

39:23.788 --> 39:25.187
Are we ready?
-Good.

39:25.188 --> 39:26.508
We're ready to fly, baby.

39:27.508 --> 39:28.787
Oh-oh. Back to back.

39:28.788 --> 39:30.147
You got it, Brodie.

39:30.148 --> 39:31.947
It looks like it could be
a foot race.

39:31.948 --> 39:35.707
Yeah, this is awful.
-Let's go, babe!

39:35.708 --> 39:38.107
It's like a long fuse
for a dynamite.

39:38.108 --> 39:39.547
Yeah, that's it.

39:39.548 --> 39:43.787
Please fly, please fly.
Yes. Yeah, baby!

39:43.788 --> 39:47.147
Yeah, Brodie, Let's go! Whoo!

39:47.148 --> 39:49.787
Yeah! Whoo!

39:49.788 --> 39:52.227
Go.
-Go, Zach, go!

39:52.228 --> 39:54.547
You got it!
-Whoo-hoo!

39:54.548 --> 39:56.827
Good job, babe, keep going!
-This is awesome!

39:56.828 --> 39:59.227
"Take an outrigger
to your next Pit Stop."

39:59.228 --> 40:01.467
"The last team to check-in
may be eliminated."

40:01.468 --> 40:03.587
Let's go.
-Go, go, go!

40:03.588 --> 40:05.337
We're fighting to not get
eliminated right now.

40:05.338 --> 40:07.377
The Kings are right behind us,
it's going to be really close.

40:07.378 --> 40:10.307
Brodie and Kurt left literally
one minute ago.

40:10.308 --> 40:12.428
Anything could happen.
-Anything could happen.

40:14.988 --> 40:18.707
Is this it? Semawang?
This way. This way.

40:18.708 --> 40:21.187
Let's get the marked outrigger.
Is that it, babe? Is that it?

40:21.188 --> 40:25.147
Come on, Brodie, let's go.
Do or die, baby, do or die. -Go, go.

40:25.148 --> 40:27.027
Come on, babe,
there's a team right there,

40:27.028 --> 40:28.337
there's another team right there.

40:28.338 --> 40:29.667
Come on.

40:29.668 --> 40:31.587
(PANTS)
Go, Brodie, come on.

40:31.588 --> 40:33.587
Come on, Rach.
They're right there. Go, baby.

40:33.588 --> 40:35.147
I'm trying.

40:35.148 --> 40:37.987
Super hard, right, or not?

40:37.988 --> 40:39.827
Give it the push, Brodie.

40:39.828 --> 40:42.187
Sheri, Cole, incredible effort,

40:42.188 --> 40:44.507
I'm pleased to tell
you are team number three.

40:44.508 --> 40:45.987
(CHEERING)

40:45.988 --> 40:48.708
Matt, Dana, that would make you
team number four, congratulations.

40:49.748 --> 40:51.827
Let's go, just push, you're not
doing anything,

40:51.828 --> 40:53.147
I'm just going back and forth.

40:53.148 --> 40:54.987
Dude, when the thing starts
going to the right...

40:54.988 --> 40:56.147
Look, when my tip... Listen to me.

40:56.148 --> 40:58.107
But I don't think you know
what you're talking about, bro.

40:58.108 --> 40:59.187
Do you want to switch?

40:59.188 --> 41:01.187
It's alright, come on,
don't get frustrated. -Let's go.

41:01.188 --> 41:02.747
Come on, Rachey.
-I'm trying.

41:02.748 --> 41:04.427
Come on, baby,
we're going to catch up.

41:04.428 --> 41:07.377
Look at this finish we have,
this is a very close finish.

41:07.378 --> 41:09.667
That's the Kings there.
-Yeah, that's Zach and Rachel.

41:09.668 --> 41:11.947
Frisbee guys right there.
-Come on, Brodie.

41:11.948 --> 41:15.307
Everything you've got! Everything
you've got! Everything, go!

41:15.308 --> 41:18.107
Babe, there it is, it's right there.
Come on, harder, harder.

41:18.108 --> 41:19.267
I'm trying.
-Let's finish, come on.

41:19.268 --> 41:21.108
Let's finish strong.
Let's make it count.

41:29.188 --> 41:31.948
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

41:34.858 --> 41:37.307
Brodie ad Kurt,
you're team number five.

41:37.308 --> 41:39.627
You barely beat out the Kings,
it was very, very close.

41:39.628 --> 41:41.227
The Kings are just coming in
right now.

41:41.228 --> 41:42.267
Hi, Kings.

41:42.268 --> 41:44.267
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

41:44.268 --> 41:48.508
Zach and Rachel, unfortunately
you are the last team to arrive.

41:49.898 --> 41:51.667
And I'm very sorry to tell you
that you have been

41:51.668 --> 41:54.547
eliminated from the race.
-That's OK.

41:54.548 --> 41:58.467
We ran hard and couldn't have had
a better race with my best friend.

41:58.468 --> 42:01.787
Unfortunately, Zach and Rachel
have to leave us at this point.

42:01.788 --> 42:04.337
We'll walk the plank, Phil.
-Going to walk the plank.

42:04.338 --> 42:06.307
Uh-oh. Come on.

42:06.308 --> 42:09.307

<i>PHIL: Next week on The Amazing Race,</i>

42:38.956 --> 42:40.075
<i>only five remain.</i>

42:40.076 --> 42:42.795
I hope it doesn't
cock-a-doodle-doo-doo on me.

42:42.835 --> 42:45.714
<i>Which team...</i>
-That Detour was really hell.

42:45.715 --> 42:47.234
<i>..will step up their game...</i>
-Ahh!

42:47.235 --> 42:49.474
Push out.
-I can't.

42:49.475 --> 42:50.874
There she goes!

42:50.875 --> 42:52.674
<i>..and play the Double U-Turn?</i>

42:52.675 --> 42:55.154
The only way they stand a chance
is if they U-Turn somebody else.

42:55.155 --> 42:56.475
I kind of think use it.
