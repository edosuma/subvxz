Maura: I wonder if the
chard is locally sourced.

01:55.936 --> 01:58.671
Mm, you should ask. We don't
want foreign chard. [Chuckles]

01:58.706 --> 02:01.241
Waitress: It's from the gentleman.

02:03.777 --> 02:05.845
Oh, come on.

02:07.314 --> 02:09.716
You know, French women
don't obsess over having

02:09.750 --> 02:12.085
<i>the occasional glass of
wine when they're pregnant.</i>

02:12.119 --> 02:13.953
French women don't shave their underarms.

02:14.021 --> 02:15.855
Good point.

02:15.890 --> 02:17.590
I'll let him down easy.

02:18.893 --> 02:20.827
She's a lesbian!

02:20.861 --> 02:22.262
Gay!

02:25.065 --> 02:27.100
How very open-minded of him.

02:28.269 --> 02:30.637
She's also in her first trimester.

02:31.839 --> 02:33.840
- Pregnant.
- Stop it!

02:35.876 --> 02:38.244
Hm. Well-played.

02:38.312 --> 02:41.281
Oh, that reminds me of something
I've been meaning to bring up.

02:41.315 --> 02:42.649
Uh-oh.

02:42.716 --> 02:44.017
Baby's college fund.

02:44.051 --> 02:46.819
It's never too early to
start a 529 savings plan.

02:46.854 --> 02:48.855
I mean, the tax benefits
alone are worth the paperwork.

02:48.923 --> 02:50.823
I'm sorry. I kind of dozed
off there for a second.

02:50.858 --> 02:52.292
What were you saying?

02:52.326 --> 02:54.093
- Very funny.
- [Cellphones buzzing]

02:54.128 --> 02:55.762
[Cellphones beep]

02:55.796 --> 02:57.997
Rizzoli. Dr. Isles.

03:01.035 --> 03:02.669
Is that really true about French women?

03:02.703 --> 03:04.103
I don't actually know.
I've never been with one.

03:32.700 --> 03:33.833
Hey.

03:33.901 --> 03:36.769
Peter Baldwin 35, lived alone.

03:36.837 --> 03:39.239
Nothing out of the ordinary
about the house except for this.

03:40.874 --> 03:43.309
[Gasps]

03:43.344 --> 03:46.946
I've always wanted one of these.

03:46.981 --> 03:49.182
Shaggy and Scooby would be so proud.

03:49.250 --> 03:50.950
After you, Velma.

03:50.985 --> 03:53.386
Uh... no, she's Velma.
I'm Daphne, obviously.

03:53.454 --> 03:55.154
Maura, back me up on this?

03:55.189 --> 03:57.223
I'm going to examine the body.

03:58.659 --> 03:59.959
Velma.

04:00.027 --> 04:02.829
- What's in there?
- Some kind of bunker.

04:02.863 --> 04:03.930
Custom-built.

04:03.964 --> 04:06.299
Guy went in, didn't come out.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.134
Friend got worried and called the police.

04:08.168 --> 04:10.870
Took fire rescue two hours
to cut through that door.

04:10.904 --> 04:12.171
Scott: I was right.

04:12.206 --> 04:13.973
I really didn't want to be right.

04:14.008 --> 04:15.074
You called the police?

04:15.109 --> 04:16.909
- Scott Hines.
- Detective Rizzoli.

04:16.944 --> 04:18.978
I still can't believe it.
Like, I just talked to him.

04:19.046 --> 04:20.947
What can you tell us about this?

04:20.981 --> 04:22.415
It's a bug-out shelter.

04:22.449 --> 04:23.716
A bug-out shelter.

04:23.784 --> 04:25.685
We're survivalists...

04:25.719 --> 04:27.120
As in doomsday, end times.

04:27.154 --> 04:28.821
Mm-hmm.

04:28.856 --> 04:30.957
These shelters are meant to
be totally self-sustaining

04:30.991 --> 04:32.825
in a worst-case scenario.

04:32.860 --> 04:35.728
Well, how can you tell what
the worst case scenario will be?

04:35.763 --> 04:37.397
Well, it's a big topic of debate.

04:37.431 --> 04:40.099
- How so?
- Well, I mean, the possibilities are endless.

04:40.134 --> 04:43.236
You got F5 tornadoes, solar flare,

04:43.270 --> 04:45.972
black holes, nuclear fallout.

04:46.006 --> 04:47.273
Everybody's got different theories.

04:47.308 --> 04:49.042
And what was Peter's theory?

04:49.076 --> 04:52.412
Airborne toxins... sarin gas, agent 15.

04:52.479 --> 04:54.380
H1N1, H5N1...

04:54.415 --> 04:56.349
- Yeah,
- I think we got it.

04:57.818 --> 04:59.352
Rita, his wife...

04:59.386 --> 05:01.888
She died of drug-resistant
tuberculosis a few years ago.

05:01.922 --> 05:04.057
That's when he got into all this stuff.

05:04.091 --> 05:05.391
Why was he in there yesterday?

05:05.459 --> 05:07.360
24-hour test run.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.729
He did them every couple of months.

05:09.763 --> 05:12.432
But when he didn't come
out at the scheduled time,

05:12.466 --> 05:14.467
I got a bad feeling.

05:16.136 --> 05:18.304
Okay. Thank you very much.

05:23.010 --> 05:25.111
Okay. If this is what surviving
the apocalypse looks like,

05:25.145 --> 05:26.913
I'd rather be a zombie.

05:26.947 --> 05:29.482
The whole place is sealed
completely from the inside.

05:29.516 --> 05:31.484
That's a re-breathing unit over there.

05:31.518 --> 05:33.353
Recycling his own air?

05:33.387 --> 05:35.321
Some first-class paranoia.

05:35.356 --> 05:37.490
Extreme, but it's not unfounded.

05:37.524 --> 05:40.259
You know, the black plague
killed one European in four

05:40.294 --> 05:41.494
in the 14th century.

05:41.528 --> 05:43.763
Influenza killed nearly 20 million people

05:43.797 --> 05:45.498
between 1918 and 1919.

05:45.532 --> 05:47.333
Well, I don't think he died from the flu.

05:47.368 --> 05:50.136
Maura, could this
have been a heart attack?

05:50.170 --> 05:52.472
Well, he has signs of vasoconstriction,

05:52.506 --> 05:54.273
but his rigor is more advanced

05:54.308 --> 05:56.175
than I'd expect, given body temperature.

05:56.210 --> 05:58.010
So no heart attack.

05:58.045 --> 06:00.012
Well, I'm more inclined to say
he had some sort of a seizure,

06:00.047 --> 06:03.182
perhaps from a potential loss of oxygen.

06:03.250 --> 06:04.784
There's blown fuse in the ventilation unit.

06:04.818 --> 06:06.285
That could cause a drop in oxygen.

06:06.353 --> 06:08.187
Co2 poisoning seems like a rookie mistake

06:08.222 --> 06:10.089
for somebody who's obsessed
with being able to breathe.

06:10.124 --> 06:13.393
And carbon dioxide poisoning isn't sudden.

06:13.460 --> 06:16.028
You know, he would have
had time to change the fuse

06:16.063 --> 06:18.798
or simply just open the door
before he lost consciousness.

06:18.832 --> 06:20.800
But this... it feels sudden.

06:21.902 --> 06:24.103
So... murder?

06:27.474 --> 06:28.775
It's suspicious.

06:28.842 --> 06:31.010
Alone in a sealed room.

06:32.179 --> 06:33.880
I'm not going to say he was murdered.

06:33.947 --> 06:35.448
It's suspicious.

06:35.482 --> 06:36.783
We have a mystery.

06:36.817 --> 06:38.584
If only we had the mystery machine.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.387
Really? Still with the Scooby Doo?

06:41.455 --> 06:43.322
Zoinks!

06:43.357 --> 06:44.457
[Chuckles]

06:44.491 --> 06:46.492
Better get that fuse to the lab.

06:48.829 --> 06:52.064
You realize that every episode
was exactly the same, right?

06:52.099 --> 06:54.333
A greedy millionaire dresses up as a ghost

06:54.401 --> 06:56.636
to protect his property from a land grab.

06:57.404 --> 06:59.005
It's a classic.

06:59.039 --> 07:01.240
The title character is a talking dog.

07:01.275 --> 07:03.910
Who solves crimes.

07:05.112 --> 07:07.280
Agree to disagree.

07:08.882 --> 07:10.016
[Sighs]

07:10.050 --> 07:12.318
And he was a great Dane, by the way.

07:15.189 --> 07:19.158
Hey. I'm all worried about Frankie.

07:19.193 --> 07:20.827
I think we have a problem.

07:20.861 --> 07:22.862
And by "we," you mean...?

07:22.930 --> 07:24.397
Twice this week, I
offered to make him dinner.

07:24.431 --> 07:26.032
He refused.

07:26.066 --> 07:28.100
If I call him on his phone
at night, he doesn't answer.

07:28.135 --> 07:31.204
You don't think he's... sleeping, do you?

07:31.238 --> 07:35.074
If I ask him where he
was, he gets all defensive.

07:35.108 --> 07:37.477
I... I mean, I think it's a girl.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.111
Oh, ma.

07:39.146 --> 07:41.013
Come on. The last time
he kept a secret from me

07:41.048 --> 07:43.115
was smoking cigarettes
with the wrestling team

07:43.150 --> 07:45.284
behind Papa Gino's, remember?

07:45.319 --> 07:47.487
You do realize you're
talking about high school.

07:47.521 --> 07:50.056
- Listen, can't you just find out something for me?
- [Elevator bell dings]

07:50.090 --> 07:51.390
Okay.

07:51.458 --> 07:53.326
But I... I think you're
being paranoid, okay?

07:53.360 --> 07:55.495
And I don't think Frankie is smoking.

07:55.529 --> 07:56.562
Or wrestling.

07:56.597 --> 07:58.097
I'm not paranoid.

07:58.131 --> 08:00.333
- I'm protective.
- [Elevator bell dings]

08:05.239 --> 08:06.672
How you doing, Frankie?

08:06.707 --> 08:08.574
Fine.

08:14.515 --> 08:15.982
Good.

08:16.717 --> 08:18.384
What we got?

08:18.418 --> 08:20.219
Peter Baldwin was a V.P
at an electronics firm.

08:20.254 --> 08:21.921
Talked to his co-workers they liked him.

08:21.989 --> 08:23.489
Seemed like a normal guy.

08:23.524 --> 08:27.293
Yeah, except for the whole
post-apocalyptic survival thing.

08:27.327 --> 08:29.028
What side of the door do you want to be on?

08:29.096 --> 08:30.997
What's that?

08:31.031 --> 08:32.465
It's a popular motto among preppers.

08:32.499 --> 08:34.933
Oh, they seem nuts until the
day the shit hits the fan,

08:34.967 --> 08:36.402
then we all come running
to them for toilet paper.

08:36.436 --> 08:39.038
- You've been doing research?
- Or I'm a prepper.

08:41.207 --> 08:42.441
I'm not a prepper.

08:42.476 --> 08:44.210
But it's not some weird fringe group.

08:44.278 --> 08:46.679
There's thousands of these
bunkers all over the country.

08:46.713 --> 08:48.514
Whole websites devoted to designing them.

08:48.549 --> 08:50.516
There are websites devoted
to costumes for cats.

08:50.551 --> 08:52.385
Doesn't mean they're not crazy.

08:52.419 --> 08:55.054
We're gonna go to CSRU, see if
they found anything at the scene.

08:55.088 --> 08:58.190
Sign this birthday card. Lisa
in dispatch turning 40.

08:58.225 --> 09:00.159
Mm. The dreaded "F" word.

09:02.062 --> 09:04.063
- [Pen clicks]
- Okay.

09:04.097 --> 09:07.033
40... is the new 30.

09:07.067 --> 09:08.134
No.

09:08.136 --> 09:12.004
40... is just a number.

09:12.072 --> 09:14.507
- [Scoffs]
- 40...

09:14.541 --> 09:16.142
Kind of sucks.

09:18.478 --> 09:20.546
Happy Birthday. Love, Jane.

09:42.340 --> 09:43.673
Oh, I was just gonna call you.

09:43.708 --> 09:46.209
I've got a surprise here.

09:46.243 --> 09:47.610
I don't like surprises.

09:47.645 --> 09:48.911
It's a good one.

09:51.440 --> 09:52.901
Do you want to talk about it?

09:53.688 --> 09:54.769
<i>We are talking about it.</i>

09:54.804 --> 09:56.218
We are?

09:56.413 --> 09:59.000
Maura, we don't have time
for this. I need you to focus.

09:59.574 --> 10:01.241
Okay.

10:01.276 --> 10:03.310
Uh, would you like to
hear the cause of death?

10:04.076 --> 10:05.677
Yes, please.

10:08.080 --> 10:10.382
Halon gas.

10:10.416 --> 10:11.850
What's that?

10:11.884 --> 10:14.452
In liquefied form, it's
combined with other chemicals

10:14.487 --> 10:16.821
to interrupt the chain reaction
necessary for combustion.

10:16.856 --> 10:19.391
- A fire extinguisher.
- In liquefied form.

10:19.425 --> 10:22.827
In gas form, it's odorless,
it leaves no residue,

10:22.862 --> 10:25.397
and in large concentrations,
it's fatal to humans.

10:25.431 --> 10:26.898
So he suffocated.

10:26.932 --> 10:29.634
It would be like drowning
in a room with no water.

10:29.669 --> 10:30.969
[Sighs]

10:31.037 --> 10:32.737
Could this have been a freak accident?

10:32.772 --> 10:37.795
Like a fire-safety-system
malfunction or something?

10:37.829 --> 10:40.631
You know, halon a
commercial fire suppressant.

10:40.699 --> 10:42.934
I know of no natural sources of it.

10:42.968 --> 10:44.969
If it was in that bunker...

10:45.003 --> 10:46.737
Somebody pumped it in there.

10:46.772 --> 10:48.439
He was probably dead before
he could do anything about it.

10:49.408 --> 10:50.942
Well, Mr. Airborne Toxins

10:50.976 --> 10:53.578
was supposed to be in a
completely sealed chamber.

10:53.612 --> 10:56.113
I'll have susie take a mass
spectrometer over to the bunker

10:56.148 --> 10:58.683
and see if she can
detect how the gas got in.

10:58.717 --> 11:01.652
Okay, uh, Frankie's supposed to
go over there and meet the builder.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.087
I'll have him tell you when.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.121
Okay.

11:09.127 --> 11:10.695
Is there something else?

11:12.431 --> 11:13.998
What brought you down here?

11:15.601 --> 11:16.701
- Korsak's retiring. What?

11:16.735 --> 11:17.735
Since when?

11:17.803 --> 11:19.637
I don't know.

11:19.671 --> 11:21.472
Well, what did he say?

11:22.474 --> 11:23.507
He didn't.

11:23.542 --> 11:24.809
Then how do you know?

11:24.843 --> 11:27.678
I saw the retirement package on his desk.

11:27.713 --> 11:31.582
It never occurred to me that
he's old enough to retire.

11:31.617 --> 11:33.551
You need to talk to him and get the facts.

11:33.585 --> 11:36.754
It's possible that you're
drawing conclusions too early.

11:36.822 --> 11:39.223
I can't imagine doing this without him,

11:39.257 --> 11:41.310
especially so soon after losing Frost...

11:42.215 --> 11:45.725
Look, all you know is that he
is preparing for his future.

11:45.726 --> 11:47.507
That doesn't mean that he's leaving today.

11:48.096 --> 11:49.931
Right.

11:54.870 --> 11:56.804
You remember where you
were when Kennedy was shot?

11:56.839 --> 11:57.872
What?

11:57.906 --> 11:59.207
JFK.

11:59.241 --> 12:02.677
There was a documentary on the other night.

12:02.711 --> 12:05.046
You remember when he was shot?

12:05.080 --> 12:06.080
Better than you do, I bet.

12:06.114 --> 12:07.615
Well, yeah, but, I mean,

12:07.649 --> 12:09.784
you couldn't have been that old, and...

12:09.818 --> 12:11.252
You must have been, like...

12:11.286 --> 12:13.521
Old enough to know I.B.J.
was gonna send us to Vietnam.

12:14.957 --> 12:17.124
Good news is Peter's laptop is functional.

12:17.159 --> 12:18.626
And the bad news?

12:18.694 --> 12:21.095
It's encrypted with
Pentagon-level security.

12:21.129 --> 12:22.797
Can you get somebody to crack it?

12:22.831 --> 12:25.566
- [Clears throat]
- Yeah. I'll get somebody.

12:25.601 --> 12:26.934
Okay.

12:26.969 --> 12:30.104
Um... have a look at
this guy's bank records.

12:30.138 --> 12:32.607
Large cash withdrawals at regular intervals

12:32.641 --> 12:35.743
over the last year.

12:35.777 --> 12:37.778
- Korsak: Just under 10 grand each time.
- Mm-hmm.

12:37.813 --> 12:39.780
Trying to dodge IRS attention.

12:39.815 --> 12:41.082
Regulation "D" triggers are meant

12:41.116 --> 12:42.783
to flag drug dealers, money launderers.

12:42.851 --> 12:44.652
Peter didn't fit those profiles.

12:44.686 --> 12:46.854
Frankie: I'm telling you,
these guys hate the government.

12:46.889 --> 12:48.256
He wouldn't want the feds looking
into what he was doing with his money,

12:48.323 --> 12:49.356
even if it was legal.

12:49.747 --> 12:51.491
He withdrew most of his life saving.

12:52.030 --> 12:53.393
Over four underground.

12:53.393 --> 12:55.526
What would he need that kind of cash for?

12:55.561 --> 12:57.528
Did he have any enemies? Was
there somebody blackmailing him?

12:57.563 --> 12:58.829
Neighbor saw a fistfight

12:58.864 --> 13:00.665
between Peter and somebody named Noah

13:00.732 --> 13:02.633
not long ago right on the front lawn.

13:02.668 --> 13:05.002
What do guys like this have
to fight over, duct tape?

13:05.037 --> 13:07.772
- [Laughs]
- Don't underestimate these guys, Jane.

13:07.806 --> 13:10.541
Now, when I pulled his phone records,

13:10.609 --> 13:13.344
I found calls to and from a Noah Forsythe

13:13.378 --> 13:15.947
until a month ago, then the calls stopped.

13:15.981 --> 13:17.248
They didn't speak again.

13:17.282 --> 13:19.050
Let's pick him up, see what their beef was.

13:19.084 --> 13:21.586
All right.

13:21.620 --> 13:23.654
Hey, I don't need to worry
about you showing up to work

13:23.689 --> 13:25.089
in a little tinfoil hat, right?

13:25.123 --> 13:26.624
You laugh, but there's evidence

13:26.692 --> 13:28.259
that those hats are effective against...

13:28.293 --> 13:30.061
Do me a favor... never
finish that sentence.

13:30.095 --> 13:32.597
Maura and I are headed to the bug-out.

13:32.631 --> 13:35.132
All right, keep an eye
out for little green men.

13:35.167 --> 13:36.100
[Sighs]

13:41.873 --> 13:43.207
How many of these things have you built?

13:43.242 --> 13:45.743
Oh, dozens.

13:45.777 --> 13:47.245
You a survivalist, too?

13:47.279 --> 13:48.579
[Chuckling] No, no.

13:48.647 --> 13:51.015
The, uh, doomsday guys trust me.

13:51.049 --> 13:53.284
I have a lot of workarounds
for building codes,

13:53.318 --> 13:55.286
permit rules, boring stuff like that.

13:55.320 --> 13:57.288
Well, it must have been good business.

13:57.322 --> 14:00.891
Yeah, they were great
guys... especially Peter.

14:00.926 --> 14:02.093
It's a real shame.

14:02.160 --> 14:03.194
[Chuckles]

14:03.262 --> 14:04.729
I have to admit, at first,

14:04.763 --> 14:06.764
I thought they were all a little nuts.

14:06.798 --> 14:07.932
Well, I have to say,

14:08.000 --> 14:09.734
the more time I spend around pathogens,

14:09.768 --> 14:11.969
the more sense something
like this makes to me.

14:12.037 --> 14:14.305
Well, I have a new model
that blocks out microbes

14:14.339 --> 14:15.873
down to the molecular level.

14:15.907 --> 14:17.174
Well, how do you do that?

14:17.209 --> 14:19.210
Micron filters, mainly.

14:19.244 --> 14:21.012
Filters on that scale are a fortune.

14:21.046 --> 14:22.847
How much do you charge for that model?

14:22.881 --> 14:24.882
Frankie: [Clears throat]

14:24.916 --> 14:27.785
Actually, uh, what I'm looking for here

14:27.819 --> 14:31.155
is how someone could pump air
into the ventilation system

14:31.223 --> 14:32.857
once the unit is sealed.

14:32.891 --> 14:34.392
That's impossible.

14:34.426 --> 14:37.328
Do you have an emergency valve
that accessed an outside vent

14:37.362 --> 14:38.829
in case the system failed?

14:38.897 --> 14:40.197
No, Peter wouldn't have allowed that.

14:40.232 --> 14:41.699
Listen, Bob, Peter died from a gas

14:41.733 --> 14:43.034
that shouldn't have been in here.

14:44.703 --> 14:46.103
Trying to figure out how that happened.

14:46.138 --> 14:49.006
I built this thing
according to Peter's specs.

14:49.041 --> 14:51.776
I'm telling you... the bunker was sealed.

14:51.810 --> 14:52.810
Susie: Dr. Isles.

14:52.844 --> 14:54.011
Yes, Susie?

14:54.079 --> 14:55.646
None of our equipment is working,

14:55.714 --> 14:56.770
and the spectroscope is on the fritz.

14:56.775 --> 14:58.599
I can't even get a barometer reading.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.517
Well, did you check it
before we left the lab?

15:01.076 --> 15:03.478
I thought I did.

15:03.512 --> 15:06.280
All right, we're going to
need to run some diagnostics

15:06.348 --> 15:07.248
back at the lab.

15:07.282 --> 15:09.083
Do you have a card?

15:09.118 --> 15:11.919
Let me know if you want
to look at that new model.

15:11.954 --> 15:14.756
You ever build one with a shoe closet?

15:23.332 --> 15:25.199
Want some coffee?

15:25.234 --> 15:27.902
Why, so you can have
my fingerprints on file?

15:27.936 --> 15:29.403
There a reason I should have your prints?

15:29.438 --> 15:31.272
Guys like you don't need a reason.

15:33.942 --> 15:37.111
I want to ask you about Peter Baldwin.

15:37.146 --> 15:38.746
What about him?

15:38.781 --> 15:40.348
Word is you were close,
and then you weren't.

15:40.382 --> 15:41.482
What happened?

15:41.517 --> 15:43.151
We had a fight.

15:43.185 --> 15:44.418
Anything to do with all
the money he paid you?

15:44.453 --> 15:46.921
I don't know what you're talking about.

15:50.092 --> 15:52.093
This is a record of large cash withdrawals

15:52.127 --> 15:53.861
Peter made from his bank accounts.

15:53.896 --> 15:55.763
On the days of those withdrawals,

15:55.798 --> 15:58.132
we have his cellphone and your cellphone

15:58.167 --> 16:00.501
going to the same locations
at the same times, okay?

16:00.536 --> 16:02.737
You tracked my cellphone?

16:02.771 --> 16:03.774
You got a warrant for that?

16:03.800 --> 16:05.802
I don't think that's what
the jury's gonna focus on.

16:05.803 --> 16:06.873
The jury?

16:06.874 --> 16:08.270
So you think I killed him.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.385
You and Peter were close.

16:10.419 --> 16:11.920
After the falling out, you decided,

16:11.987 --> 16:13.354
why not use his secrets against him?

16:13.389 --> 16:14.923
What secrets?

16:14.957 --> 16:16.991
Whatever he was paying you to keep quiet.

16:17.026 --> 16:19.527
Look, this is a gross
misuse of taxpayer money...

16:19.562 --> 16:21.396
spying on private citizens, tr...

16:21.430 --> 16:24.032
Well, I will care a lot
more about your politics

16:24.066 --> 16:25.433
when I don't like you for Peter's murder.

16:25.501 --> 16:27.402
Gold, okay?

16:27.436 --> 16:31.372
He was buying gold from me.

16:31.407 --> 16:32.340
You're a gold dealer?

16:33.442 --> 16:36.344
Some preppers think
that, when the banks fail,

16:36.378 --> 16:39.314
you can roll up your
paper money and smoke it.

16:39.381 --> 16:41.082
Gold's the only sure thing.

16:41.117 --> 16:42.383
Where'd you get it?

16:42.418 --> 16:45.086
Estate sales mostly, Internet auctions.

16:45.121 --> 16:47.455
It's off-book, but it's not illegal.

16:47.490 --> 16:49.891
I had my differences with Peter,

16:49.925 --> 16:53.962
but I still like green
money, and he had a lot of it.

16:54.029 --> 16:55.530
You didn't tell me what
the fight was about.

16:55.564 --> 16:58.466
[Sighs]

16:58.501 --> 17:01.035
I helped him build his
bug-out, and in return,

17:01.070 --> 17:03.438
he said I could crash
there if D-Day ever came.

17:03.472 --> 17:05.240
But then, he reneged

17:05.273 --> 17:09.042
after I pooh-poohed his stupid
airborne-toxic-event theory.

17:09.078 --> 17:11.246
The fight was about how the world will end?

17:11.280 --> 17:14.382
It's robots, obviously.

17:14.415 --> 17:17.252
Intelligent machines, networked data.

17:21.089 --> 17:22.557
I'm right about the robots, detective.

17:24.093 --> 17:26.861
We're all just one
keystroke away from anarchy.

17:26.929 --> 17:30.031
I'll go back up my hard drive.

17:34.971 --> 17:37.172
Hi. The builder any help?

17:37.206 --> 17:38.673
None whatsoever.

17:38.708 --> 17:40.375
Have you checked for any indication

17:40.443 --> 17:42.677
that Peter brought the halon in with him?

17:42.712 --> 17:44.679
Mm, how, like a delayed-release bomb?

17:44.714 --> 17:45.981
Possibly.

17:46.015 --> 17:47.215
Well, CSRU went through his duffel bag.

17:47.249 --> 17:48.783
It was mostly guns and ammo.

17:48.851 --> 17:50.952
Hmm.

17:58.728 --> 18:00.295
What are you doing?

18:00.363 --> 18:02.797
I'm looking up Korsak's service record

18:02.832 --> 18:05.200
to see when he's eligible for retirement.

18:05.234 --> 18:06.234
You're snooping.

18:07.336 --> 18:08.803
This is not snooping.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.839
Then why are you using my computer?

18:10.873 --> 18:12.974
Because I don't want him
to catch me not snooping.

18:13.009 --> 18:14.175
[Cellphone vibrates]

18:14.243 --> 18:15.176
When I told you to get the facts,

18:15.211 --> 18:16.144
I did not mean to imply...

18:16.178 --> 18:17.712
It's Frankie.

18:17.747 --> 18:20.749
I have to go. To be continued.

18:22.218 --> 18:24.419
She's snooping.

18:27.857 --> 18:28.890
What do you got?

18:28.924 --> 18:30.458
I broke the encryption code.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.761
We think we have footage
from right before Peter died.

18:32.795 --> 18:34.062
<i>I'm sorry, you broke the code?</i>

18:34.096 --> 18:36.998
I called in a favor with a techie friend.

18:37.033 --> 18:40.709
Well, you owe that friend
a six-pack. Let me see it.

18:43.773 --> 18:45.006
Wait, wait, right there.

18:45.041 --> 18:45.940
Right there. Go in.

18:45.975 --> 18:46.775
[Keyboard clacks]

18:46.809 --> 18:47.409
[Monitor beeps]

18:47.413 --> 18:48.713
See that box behind him?

18:48.748 --> 18:50.015
That wasn't in the bug-out.

18:50.049 --> 18:51.616
[Keyboard clacks]

18:52.852 --> 18:55.787
[Monitor beeps]

18:55.821 --> 18:57.255
You're right.

18:57.290 --> 19:01.259
What would the dimensions
of 400 grand in gold bars be?

19:01.294 --> 19:03.895
One kilo is worth about 40 grand

19:03.930 --> 19:06.131
and roughly the size of a smartphone.

19:06.198 --> 19:11.636
So... 400 grand would
be about 10 smartphones?

19:12.708 --> 19:14.343
That's about what you
could fit in that lockbox.

19:14.536 --> 19:15.491
The wall safe was empty.

19:15.491 --> 19:17.138
That's probably where he kept the gold

19:17.138 --> 19:18.538
when he wasn't, you know, bugging out.

19:18.538 --> 19:19.984
Mm-hmm, and during his practice run,

19:19.984 --> 19:21.538
he took it in there with him,

19:21.538 --> 19:24.182
along with his guns and his canned beans.

19:24.216 --> 19:25.817
And somebody else took it out.

19:25.851 --> 19:29.654
Yeah, Peter wasn't just
killed. He was robbed.

19:29.689 --> 19:30.956
Somebody got in the bunker

19:30.990 --> 19:32.991
that nobody was supposed to get into.

19:33.025 --> 19:34.993
The door was sealed.

19:35.027 --> 19:36.261
What's that saying?

19:36.295 --> 19:38.196
One door closes, another one opens?

19:38.230 --> 19:41.132
You think there was another door?

19:41.167 --> 19:43.868
Yeah.

19:43.903 --> 19:46.371
And Peter was on the wrong side of it.

19:46.439 --> 19:47.806
Right.

19:53.861 --> 19:54.694
[Sighs] There's got to be a way in.

19:55.730 --> 19:56.759
We're missing something.

19:56.932 --> 19:59.042
We could run ground-penetrating
radar over the property,

19:59.228 --> 20:00.225
map the subsurface.

20:00.413 --> 20:01.555
A hidden entrance might show up.

20:01.570 --> 20:03.921
Yeah, Frankie, will you
set that up for tomorrow?

20:04.073 --> 20:05.673
Uh... now?

20:05.708 --> 20:07.381
Yeah, now. Why, you got a date?

20:07.437 --> 20:09.638
I have an appointment... that I can't miss.

20:09.673 --> 20:10.606
Oh?

20:10.640 --> 20:12.875
Korsak: I'll do it.

20:12.909 --> 20:13.876
Thanks.

20:14.040 --> 20:16.142
Uh... see you.

20:16.176 --> 20:17.676
What's that about?

20:17.711 --> 20:19.078
Who knows?

20:19.112 --> 20:21.680
People have all kinds of secrets, I find.

20:21.715 --> 20:22.615
Guess so.

20:24.618 --> 20:26.085
Is there something you'd like to tell me?

20:29.756 --> 20:31.724
Have a nice night?

20:31.758 --> 20:32.958
Hm.

20:38.165 --> 20:39.798
Jane: Explain to me again

20:39.833 --> 20:41.967
why I'm not on my couch eating nachos.

20:42.002 --> 20:43.969
Well, this case
has me thinking...

20:44.004 --> 20:47.006
There is merit in planning
for unforeseen circumstances.

20:47.040 --> 20:49.441
You can't plan for unforeseen
circumstances, Maura,

20:49.476 --> 20:50.743
hence the term "unforeseen."

20:50.777 --> 20:52.444
Well, I'm talking about preparation,

20:52.512 --> 20:53.846
not psychic interventions.

20:53.880 --> 20:55.814
Of course you can't know
what the future holds.

20:55.849 --> 20:57.483
True, because I thought

20:57.517 --> 21:00.953
my future held nachos, cheese,
jalapenos, for example.

21:00.987 --> 21:03.923
Which is why we need to live in the moment,

21:03.957 --> 21:06.458
seize the day.

21:06.493 --> 21:08.127
What did you do?

21:08.161 --> 21:11.063
Nothing... yet.

21:11.131 --> 21:16.502
Triumph Bonneville T100 2008.

21:16.536 --> 21:20.506
Excellent condition and
a very reasonable price.

21:20.540 --> 21:22.775
Is this what you do when you say
you're having a working lunch?

21:24.911 --> 21:26.011
What is that?

21:26.046 --> 21:28.547
Sidecar... custom addition.

21:28.582 --> 21:30.516
Easy handling and, by all accounts,

21:30.550 --> 21:31.717
a very smooth ride.

21:31.785 --> 21:33.886
Are you starting a pedicab company?

21:33.920 --> 21:35.187
It's for you.

21:37.557 --> 21:40.092
Okay.

21:40.126 --> 21:41.560
Why?

21:41.595 --> 21:43.028
It's a great alternative-travel option.

21:43.063 --> 21:45.030
Now, what if you go into labor

21:45.065 --> 21:47.032
and traffic is is gridlocked,

21:47.067 --> 21:49.969
or we need to leave town
in case of an emergency?

21:50.003 --> 21:53.038
You know, the triumph handles
rough terrain and service roads.

21:53.073 --> 21:55.674
We could even ride it on
the sidewalk if we wanted.

21:57.844 --> 21:59.278
Are you using this pregnancy

21:59.312 --> 22:01.113
to satisfy one of your impulse buys?

22:01.147 --> 22:03.649
No, I'm... I am planning
for the unexpected.

22:03.683 --> 22:06.051
- And seizing an opportunity.
- [Cellphone vibrates]

22:06.086 --> 22:07.853
It won't be on the market long.

22:07.887 --> 22:09.688
Shall we take it for a test-drive?

22:09.723 --> 22:11.290
[Cellphone beeps]

22:11.374 --> 22:13.709
It's Korsak confirming the GPR tomorrow.

22:13.743 --> 22:16.145
Have you talked to him yet?

22:16.179 --> 22:18.747
[Sighs] I tried. It was not fruitful.

22:18.815 --> 22:21.016
Yes, but did you ask
him openly and directly

22:21.051 --> 22:22.685
about what you saw?

22:22.719 --> 22:24.186
- Could we please talk about something else?
- Sure.

22:24.220 --> 22:26.922
What color helmet do you want?

22:26.956 --> 22:29.091
I want nachos.

22:37.367 --> 22:38.300
[Police radio chatter]

22:38.335 --> 22:40.669
All right, thanks.

22:40.704 --> 22:43.305
The guys say it'll take about
a half-hour to map the property.

22:43.340 --> 22:44.973
Why didn't you tell me you were retiring?

22:45.008 --> 22:47.042
Who said I'm retiring?

22:47.077 --> 22:49.712
I saw the forms on your desk.

22:49.746 --> 22:51.280
You went through my desk?

22:51.348 --> 22:52.881
No, they were in plain view.

22:52.916 --> 22:54.149
Oh, really? That's what you're going with?

22:54.184 --> 22:55.617
You got one foot out the door,

22:55.652 --> 22:57.086
and you don't think I deserve to know?

22:57.120 --> 22:58.921
I didn't realize it was all about you.

22:59.989 --> 23:01.290
It's about trust, Vince.

23:01.324 --> 23:03.058
I told you about my pregnancy.

23:03.093 --> 23:05.694
You wouldn't give me a heads-up on this?

23:05.729 --> 23:07.129
Has it occurred to you

23:07.163 --> 23:09.398
that this reaction is
why I didn't tell you?

23:10.827 --> 23:11.575
Has it occurred to you

23:11.575 --> 23:13.769
that this reaction is
because you didn't tell me?

23:16.873 --> 23:18.307
Uh, did you pinpoint the problem?

23:18.341 --> 23:20.142
The problem is there is no problem.

23:20.176 --> 23:22.144
Something interfered with
my equipment at the scene.

23:22.178 --> 23:23.412
I tested everything,

23:23.446 --> 23:25.114
and everything's working fine now.

23:25.181 --> 23:26.348
And the software...

23:26.383 --> 23:27.649
Did you run an antivirus program?

23:27.684 --> 23:28.384
Twice.

23:28.418 --> 23:29.918
Hmm.

23:29.953 --> 23:31.954
So, the problem is at the site itself.

23:31.988 --> 23:33.822
This is a little out there,

23:33.857 --> 23:36.892
but an electromagnetic field
would cause problems like this,

23:36.926 --> 23:39.461
though I didn't see
anything to indicate that.

23:39.496 --> 23:42.431
But that doesn't mean it wasn't there.

23:42.465 --> 23:44.800
You're right.

23:48.872 --> 23:49.938
[Cellphone beeps]

23:49.973 --> 23:50.839
Hi, Maura. What do you got?

23:50.874 --> 23:52.975
An electromagnetic hatch

23:53.009 --> 23:54.910
that could be held in place undetectably

23:54.978 --> 23:56.812
as long as the power source is intact.

23:56.846 --> 23:58.847
Okay, well, what am I looking for?

23:58.882 --> 24:01.283
Redirect the radar team
to inside the bug-out.

24:01.317 --> 24:04.019
Tell them to look for a
battery or a small generator.

24:04.053 --> 24:06.121
I am on my way there with an emf meter.

24:06.156 --> 24:07.289
Okay.

24:07.323 --> 24:09.091
[Cellphone beeps] Change of plan.

24:09.125 --> 24:12.027
I mean, you didn't think
I had a right to know?

24:12.061 --> 24:14.396
I think I have a right to my privacy.

24:14.431 --> 24:16.064
When did you become so secretive?

24:16.099 --> 24:17.366
When did you become so nosy?

24:17.400 --> 24:18.867
Have you met my mother?

24:19.240 --> 24:21.300
[Explosion]

24:33.804 --> 24:36.591
[Police radio chatter]

24:38.594 --> 24:40.795
You know it's 'cause
you mean so much to me...

24:40.830 --> 24:42.230
That's why I got so upset.

24:42.264 --> 24:43.531
Oh, I know.

24:43.566 --> 24:45.800
And I'm sorry I called you nosy.

24:45.868 --> 24:48.870
I'm sorry I went through
the stuff on your desk.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.839
Even though it was in plain view.

24:52.908 --> 24:55.577
[Scoffs]

24:55.611 --> 24:57.579
I'm just trying to figure
out where I'm headed.

24:57.613 --> 24:59.147
That's why I hired a life coach.

24:59.215 --> 25:01.149
The packet was Kiki's suggestion.

25:01.217 --> 25:03.651
I've seen so many guys
wait so long to retire

25:03.686 --> 25:05.687
they can't enjoy it when it comes.

25:05.721 --> 25:07.856
Kiki said filling out the forms

25:07.890 --> 25:10.391
might help me figure out how I feel.

25:10.426 --> 25:12.393
And did you?

25:12.428 --> 25:14.295
Do I look like I've figured out anything?

25:17.767 --> 25:19.367
Well, if anyone has earned the right

25:19.401 --> 25:21.202
to enjoy their retirement, it's you, Vince.

25:21.237 --> 25:23.872
I also applied to take
the lieutenant's exam.

25:23.906 --> 25:25.373
Really?

25:25.407 --> 25:29.577
[Sighs] I'm just... considering my options.

25:29.612 --> 25:31.613
Well, I think you'd
make a great lieutenant,

25:31.647 --> 25:33.381
just like you make a great sergeant.

25:35.818 --> 25:37.585
Detectives...

25:37.620 --> 25:39.487
We got something.

25:53.602 --> 25:55.937
There's a sewer tunnel under the bunker.

25:55.971 --> 25:59.808
Sounds like a good way to sneak
in and out without being seen.

26:02.878 --> 26:04.279
Or not.

26:04.313 --> 26:07.649
That's Bob McGrath, the builder.

26:12.103 --> 26:13.588
[Sighs] It's a lot of bodies to find

26:13.622 --> 26:15.172
in a place designed for survival.

26:15.391 --> 26:17.763
Bomb squad thinks he was
planting a homemade C4 bomb

26:17.763 --> 26:18.535
but miss wired the timer.

26:19.228 --> 26:20.495
Trying the blow up the
evidence of the hatch.

26:20.530 --> 26:21.730
Blew himself up instead.

26:21.764 --> 26:23.198
[Sighs]

26:23.232 --> 26:26.435
Okay, so, he gets himself
hired to build the shelter.

26:26.469 --> 26:28.136
Then, he modifies the plan

26:28.171 --> 26:30.172
and leaves himself a secret entrance

26:30.206 --> 26:32.507
so he can sneak in and snake Peter's gold.

26:32.542 --> 26:34.910
But how did he know Peter had the gold
in there with him in the first place?

26:34.944 --> 26:37.212
Maybe Peter told him.

26:37.246 --> 26:39.348
Maybe Noah Forsythe told him.

26:39.415 --> 26:40.982
Did you find the gold at Bob's house?

26:41.050 --> 26:42.284
Yeah, and that's not all.

26:44.454 --> 26:49.358
Insulin, antibiotics,
diamonds, cartons of cigarettes.

26:49.392 --> 26:51.159
So, Peter wasn't his first victim.

26:51.194 --> 26:53.328
He's been pulling this
stunt on all his clients.

26:53.363 --> 26:55.163
Those that were worth his while

26:55.198 --> 26:57.032
with stocks of commodities he
thought could sell or trade.

26:57.066 --> 26:58.467
Classic marauder.

26:58.501 --> 26:59.835
A what?

26:59.902 --> 27:01.793
Marauders.

27:01.793 --> 27:03.924
They're the opposite of survivalists.

27:03.924 --> 27:07.049
Instead of making their own plans,

27:07.084 --> 27:09.051
preying on other people.

27:09.086 --> 27:10.886
Sounds like a "Road Warrior" sequel.

27:10.921 --> 27:12.288
<i>Technically, "The Road
Warrior" was a sequel.</i>

27:12.322 --> 27:13.222
<i>Hmm.</i>

27:14.124 --> 27:15.825
It makes sense, if you think about it.

27:15.859 --> 27:17.093
What's easier...

27:17.127 --> 27:18.527
Building and stocking
your own bug-out shelter

27:18.562 --> 27:20.396
or figuring out who the
guys are that have them

27:20.430 --> 27:22.031
and then raiding those?

27:22.065 --> 27:23.866
Okay, but if all Bob wanted
to do was rob his clients...

27:23.900 --> 27:24.800
I mean, he had a foolproof system.

27:24.835 --> 27:26.068
Why kill Peter?

27:26.103 --> 27:27.837
Bob was the only one
who knew about the gold.

27:27.871 --> 27:29.238
Peter would have known it was him

27:29.306 --> 27:30.473
as soon as it went missing.

27:30.507 --> 27:32.508
Or it could have been an accident.

27:32.576 --> 27:34.043
Bob was lousy at building bombs.

27:34.077 --> 27:35.911
Maybe he was no good with chemistry.

27:35.946 --> 27:37.980
He thought he was gonna knock
him out, wound up killing him.

27:38.014 --> 27:41.050
Either way, it just seems like a
lot of trouble for a box of gold.

27:41.084 --> 27:43.085
You would a terrible marauder.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.087
I would not.

27:45.122 --> 27:47.123
Are you kidding me? You
wouldn't last two weeks.

27:47.157 --> 27:48.524
I'm a survivor, thank you.

27:48.558 --> 27:50.159
And if the chips were down,

27:50.193 --> 27:53.129
I would step over my
own mother to get to...

27:53.163 --> 27:54.530
She's right behind me, isn't she?

27:54.564 --> 27:55.331
Mm.

27:55.365 --> 27:56.532
How do you do it?

27:56.566 --> 27:58.267
Do you have the place bugged?

27:58.301 --> 28:00.069
I heard about the bomb. Are you okay?

28:01.204 --> 28:02.371
Are you feeling all right?

28:02.405 --> 28:03.939
Break room, please.

Keep your voice down, all right?

28:11.181 --> 28:12.487
Not everybody knows, you know?

28:12.487 --> 28:13.895
Well, maybe they should,

28:13.896 --> 28:16.481
so they stop sending you
into very dangerous situations

28:16.488 --> 28:18.552
that could get you killed.

28:18.587 --> 28:19.987
It's kind of in the job description, mom.

28:20.022 --> 28:22.023
Jane.

28:22.057 --> 28:26.060
Take some time off, a
vacation, a leave of absence.

For nine months?

I think this case is wrapping up, okay?

28:44.513 --> 28:46.314
Okay, fine. Great.

28:46.348 --> 28:48.049
Okay, just one last thing.

28:48.116 --> 28:50.918
[Clears throat] You find
anything out about Frankie?

28:50.952 --> 28:52.420
Okay, this... this nosy
thing that you're doing,

28:52.487 --> 28:54.188
this is why Frankie doesn't tell you stuff.

28:54.222 --> 28:55.656
This is why I don't tell you stuff.

28:55.691 --> 28:57.191
You don't tell me stuff

28:57.259 --> 28:58.459
because you don't know what's good for you.

29:00.262 --> 29:02.063
You'll soon see how I feel,

29:02.097 --> 29:04.031
and you'll know that I'm right!

29:08.270 --> 29:09.503
You need to give yourself a raise.

29:09.538 --> 29:11.138
You were right about the electromagnets.

29:11.173 --> 29:12.606
I'll bring it up with the commonwealth.

29:12.641 --> 29:16.377
Yeah, you and Frankie
must have spooked Bob here

29:16.445 --> 29:18.179
when you questioned him about the bunker.

29:18.213 --> 29:19.841
He killed himself trying
to cover his tracks.

29:20.089 --> 29:21.089
I'm not sure I agree.

29:21.123 --> 29:22.524
His lungs are well-aerated.

29:22.558 --> 29:24.592
No smoke or particulate inhalation.

29:24.660 --> 29:26.327
He was at the center of the explosion.

29:26.362 --> 29:27.962
Which means he might have been dead

29:27.997 --> 29:28.930
when the bomb detonated.

29:28.964 --> 29:30.398
Look at this.

29:30.433 --> 29:32.467
Subdermal hematoma
consistent with being struck

29:32.535 --> 29:33.668
with a blunt object.

29:33.702 --> 29:35.937
Bob has a partner.

29:36.005 --> 29:37.305
Had.

29:37.339 --> 29:38.973
[Sighs]

29:39.008 --> 29:42.477
So, Bob and partner rob Peter
with this trap-door scheme,

29:42.511 --> 29:44.245
but Peter ends up dead.

29:44.280 --> 29:47.318
- Frankie and I talked to Bob.
- Mm-hmm.

29:47.318 --> 29:51.252
Bob gets nervous, tells the
partner that we're on to him.

29:51.287 --> 29:56.157
Partner takes the opportunity to
destroy... both the evidence and Bob.

29:56.192 --> 29:59.094
It really seemed like this case was over.

29:59.128 --> 30:02.964
Clearly, that's what he wanted us to think.

30:06.774 --> 30:10.443
"Marauder" is the French
word meaning "rascal."

30:12.074 --> 30:13.641
All cultures have them.

30:13.676 --> 30:15.243
Really?

30:15.277 --> 30:17.946
Pirates, bandits... It's
a practice as old as time.

30:17.980 --> 30:19.447
You know, the United States had

30:19.481 --> 30:21.883
a nuclear-fusion research
project called marauder

30:21.951 --> 30:24.519
which stood for
"magnetically accelerated ring

30:24.553 --> 30:27.121
to achieve ultra-high
directed energy and radiation."

30:27.156 --> 30:28.589
- No shit.
- Yeah.

30:28.624 --> 30:30.158
[Clears throat]

30:30.225 --> 30:31.092
Can I talk to you for a sec?

30:31.126 --> 30:32.226
Sure.

30:35.164 --> 30:36.965
- What's up, Chang?
- Hey.

30:39.568 --> 30:41.235
Listen, ma's always gonna give

30:41.270 --> 30:43.171
any girl you're dating a hard time,

30:43.205 --> 30:45.073
but you can't hide this girl forever.

30:45.107 --> 30:47.608
Just bring her around.
I'll run interference.

30:47.643 --> 30:50.411
Thanks, but... that's not
what I've been doing at night.

30:50.479 --> 30:51.579
What are you doing, then?

30:51.613 --> 30:53.481
[Inhales deeply]

30:53.515 --> 30:55.116
Computer engineering.

30:55.150 --> 30:58.186
I've been taking courses.

30:58.220 --> 31:00.088
How? When?

31:00.155 --> 31:03.524
Night classes... programming,
data systems, repairs.

31:03.559 --> 31:05.193
Wait a minute. The encrypted hard drive...

31:05.227 --> 31:06.461
Was that you?

31:06.495 --> 31:09.130
No, I'm still a novice. That was Bahar.

31:09.164 --> 31:10.331
Bahar.

31:10.399 --> 31:13.034
This Israeli kid in my class. He's 19.

31:13.068 --> 31:15.737
Look, Jane, they're not
gonna put me in homicide

31:15.771 --> 31:17.638
as long as you're still here.

31:17.706 --> 31:19.540
But I could be a detective in BRIC.

31:19.575 --> 31:21.376
I'm just getting my ducks in a row

31:21.410 --> 31:22.944
so I can make a push for it.

31:23.012 --> 31:27.281
Well, that's an... incredibly... sound plan

31:27.316 --> 31:28.249
for the future.

31:28.317 --> 31:29.617
Thank you.

31:29.651 --> 31:32.020
But what... what's
with all the secrecy?

31:32.054 --> 31:36.391
I didn't think I'd be any good at it.

31:36.425 --> 31:37.692
Frost was the best.

31:37.726 --> 31:40.261
And I knew that you
wouldn't cut me any slack

31:40.295 --> 31:42.130
if I didn't have a handle on it.

31:42.197 --> 31:43.431
You're doing great.

31:43.499 --> 31:46.334
And... and I'm... I'm
really proud of you.

31:46.402 --> 31:49.037
And Bahar.

31:49.071 --> 31:50.505
Thank you.

31:50.539 --> 31:52.673
But, please, don't tell ma.

31:52.708 --> 31:56.277
She'll just use me like
I'm her personal genius bar.

31:56.311 --> 31:57.745
Yeah, you're right.

31:57.780 --> 31:59.614
Mm. Okay, um...

31:59.648 --> 32:01.416
I'll handle ma.

32:01.450 --> 32:03.484
Uh, I... I'll... I'll just tell
her you have a new girlfriend.

32:03.519 --> 32:05.420
Just make it believable.

32:05.454 --> 32:09.253
I'll tell her she's a stripper.

32:09.287 --> 32:10.721
Great..

32:13.525 --> 32:19.030
So, Bob and his partner steal
from Bob's survivalist clients.

32:19.097 --> 32:22.266
We know what Bob's role was.
He built the secret entrances.

32:22.300 --> 32:25.002
But who is the partner?

32:25.037 --> 32:26.203
Another survivalist, you think?

32:26.238 --> 32:28.105
Would explain how they knew each other.

32:28.140 --> 32:30.541
Maybe the partner hired
Bob to build his shelter.

32:30.609 --> 32:32.443
They get to talking about
all Bob's other clients,

32:32.477 --> 32:34.111
what easy targets they'd be.

32:34.146 --> 32:36.113
Can we track down who has these bunkers?

32:36.148 --> 32:38.315
Bob dodged a lot of permit regulations,

32:38.350 --> 32:40.217
so the bunkers were
probably off the record.

32:40.285 --> 32:41.686
What about theft reports

32:41.753 --> 32:43.487
for any of the stolen
goods over at Bob's house?

32:43.522 --> 32:45.456
I checked the NCIC. There wasn't much.

32:45.490 --> 32:47.158
Then again, you don't file a report

32:47.225 --> 32:48.993
if you don't want people to know

32:49.061 --> 32:51.362
what you've been stockpiling
in the first place.

32:51.430 --> 32:53.264
No, we got to find the people he robbed,

32:53.298 --> 32:55.299
work backwards to connect
them to the partner.

32:55.333 --> 32:57.168
Well, I have a few names.

32:57.202 --> 33:00.037
There was a woman who reported
diamond theft who lives in the area.

33:00.072 --> 33:01.572
Let's talk to her.

33:01.606 --> 33:03.641
- What about clients from Bob's firm?
- I got the list.

33:03.709 --> 33:05.609
Well, start running background
checks, see if anybody sticks out.

33:05.644 --> 33:07.244
Mm.

33:10.582 --> 33:12.349
Do you know who took our diamonds?

33:12.384 --> 33:15.614
We were hoping to speak
to your husband, too.

33:15.648 --> 33:19.451
Lewis would never set foot in
a police station. No offense.

33:19.485 --> 33:22.087
You reported $20,000
worth of diamonds stolen.

33:22.155 --> 33:24.389
Six months ago. We haven't
heard anything since.

33:24.424 --> 33:26.525
Do you recognize this man?

33:28.094 --> 33:29.327
No.

33:29.362 --> 33:31.229
This isn't the guy who built your bug-out?

33:31.297 --> 33:33.765
[Scoffs] No. Lewis built it himself.

33:33.833 --> 33:35.033
How about this guy?

33:35.068 --> 33:36.535
[Sighs]

33:36.602 --> 33:38.437
I don't think so.

33:38.471 --> 33:39.738
Do you have a lead or not?

33:39.772 --> 33:41.640
Because I really need to get home.

33:41.674 --> 33:43.575
Okay, wait, wait. One more question.

33:43.609 --> 33:45.243
Um, uh, why diamonds?

33:45.278 --> 33:47.612
It wasn't to make you a necklace, was it?

33:47.647 --> 33:50.849
[Scoffs] Not even a pair of earrings.

33:50.883 --> 33:52.617
[Sighs]

33:54.520 --> 33:57.556
Lewis said the diamonds were an investment.

33:57.623 --> 34:00.592
First, he wanted to buy fuel.

34:00.626 --> 34:02.427
I told him I'm not
spending my retirement money

34:02.462 --> 34:04.096
on propane tanks.

34:04.130 --> 34:07.099
Who knew about the diamonds
besides you and Lewis?

34:07.133 --> 34:09.735
The gem dealer. He's based in Brazil...

34:09.768 --> 34:13.138
The guy who referred us
to the dealer, my mom.

34:13.172 --> 34:14.840
The guy who referred you...
You remember his name?

34:14.873 --> 34:16.108
Um...

34:16.141 --> 34:18.176
Oh, I have his card.

34:25.146 --> 34:26.446
Scott Hines

34:26.514 --> 34:28.215
Peter's friend. The
one who called the cops.

34:28.248 --> 34:31.652
Yeah, no wonder he was so
broken up about his poor friend.

34:35.556 --> 34:37.324
Police!

34:37.759 --> 34:38.792
Go, go, go!

34:46.568 --> 34:48.702
[Indistinct shouting]

34:48.735 --> 34:51.304
Officer: Clear!

34:55.877 --> 34:57.511
Don't say it.

34:57.579 --> 34:58.879
Looks like he bugged out.

35:08.391 --> 35:09.658
His car's gone.

35:09.692 --> 35:11.893
Nobody's seen him for a day and a half.

35:11.928 --> 35:15.731
If I'm Scott, where do
I put my bug-out shelter?

35:15.765 --> 35:18.533
The dirt sample we found in Scott's garage

35:18.601 --> 35:20.702
is not consistent with
the soil on his property.

35:20.737 --> 35:22.804
So he tracked it in his tire
treads from somewhere else.

35:22.839 --> 35:24.339
It would appear so.

35:24.373 --> 35:25.941
Though, not necessarily the same location

35:25.975 --> 35:27.943
as the bug-out shelter.

35:27.977 --> 35:29.978
But I don't want to make any assumptions.

35:30.012 --> 35:32.013
What'd you find?

35:32.048 --> 35:35.584
A significant concentration
of mountain spleen wort pollen.

35:35.618 --> 35:36.718
Excuse me?

35:36.753 --> 35:38.687
A little fern.

35:38.721 --> 35:40.922
It originated in the Appalachian region,

35:40.957 --> 35:43.269
and then it extended to
Western Massachusetts.

35:44.841 --> 35:46.185
- Frankie.
- Yeah?

35:46.197 --> 35:47.493
Can you search county clerk database

35:47.493 --> 35:49.492
anywhere west of Springfield

35:49.492 --> 35:50.811
to see if there's any
property linked to Scott?

35:51.120 --> 35:51.835
Sure.

35:52.859 --> 35:53.632
Hey.

35:53.998 --> 35:55.765
<i>- It's bug out.
- Bug out.</i>

35:57.535 --> 35:59.436
It's stupid no matter how you pronounce it.

36:01.205 --> 36:02.267
<i>Got something.</i>

36:02.651 --> 36:04.173
Looks like a couple acres in Southwick.

36:04.677 --> 36:08.064
Uh, property deed for Hubert Hines,
seized in two thousand eight

36:08.250 --> 36:10.585
I'll bet we know who inherited that land.

36:10.619 --> 36:12.220
That would be a perfect
place to build a cabin

36:12.254 --> 36:13.688
for the end of the world.

36:16.458 --> 36:18.125
Bug... out.

36:18.193 --> 36:20.494
<i>Bug out.</i>

36:20.562 --> 36:22.797
Bug... out.

36:22.831 --> 36:25.366
<i>Bug out.</i>

36:51.540 --> 36:53.808
We're in the right place.

36:55.677 --> 36:57.311
I don't see the cabin.

36:57.346 --> 36:59.847
There's not gonna be a cabin.

36:59.881 --> 37:02.750
He wouldn't leave
himself open to be spotted

37:02.784 --> 37:04.652
by black helicopters or whatever else it is

37:04.720 --> 37:06.387
he thinks is following him.

37:06.421 --> 37:07.688
Underground.

37:07.723 --> 37:10.925
I'm guessing this guy went down deep.

37:10.959 --> 37:14.295
Well, everybody's got to breathe.

37:14.329 --> 37:15.730
Hey. Hey.

37:15.764 --> 37:18.065
Does that tree stump look
a little too perfect to you?

37:49.546 --> 37:50.680
How long does it...

37:50.714 --> 37:52.815
- There!
- [Dogs barking]

37:52.850 --> 37:56.185
[Coughing]

37:58.255 --> 38:00.022
Welcome to doomsday, buddy.

38:00.090 --> 38:03.559
[Coughing continues]

38:09.760 --> 38:11.761
Anarchist's wife came by.

38:11.795 --> 38:14.664
Which anarchist? Robot rebellion?

38:14.698 --> 38:16.699
No. Diamonds are forever.

38:16.733 --> 38:19.035
- Ah. How is she? 
- Came to thank us.

38:19.069 --> 38:21.037
Says her husband's gonna make
her those earrings after all.

38:21.071 --> 38:22.338
Our work here is done.

38:22.372 --> 38:23.839
[Chuckles]

38:23.907 --> 38:25.241
Am I the only one struck by the irony

38:25.275 --> 38:26.876
of the people obsessed with survival

38:26.910 --> 38:28.377
are picking each other off like flies?

38:28.412 --> 38:30.179
This is an isolated incident.

38:30.214 --> 38:31.814
You're still defending them?

38:31.848 --> 38:33.149
I'm just saying.

38:33.183 --> 38:34.217
We could all be a little bit more prepared

38:34.251 --> 38:35.251
in case of emergency...

38:35.285 --> 38:39.088
- Which is why.
- Mnh-mnh.

38:39.122 --> 38:40.256
I put these together.

38:40.290 --> 38:41.521
One for everybody.

38:42.626 --> 38:43.821
- Korsak.
- Thanks.

38:43.821 --> 38:45.058
Jane.

38:47.812 --> 38:49.166
Go ahead. Open them up.

38:49.166 --> 38:50.236
Uh... okay.

38:54.185 --> 38:55.152
Better than dry leaves.

38:56.955 --> 38:58.956
Antibacterial...

38:58.990 --> 39:02.393
Beef Stew Emeril... gross.

39:02.427 --> 39:05.162
And there's a couple of personalized items

39:05.196 --> 39:06.997
for both of you.

39:08.066 --> 39:11.368
Freeze-dried ice cream.
Okay, now, this I can use.

39:11.403 --> 39:12.836
Likewise.

39:13.938 --> 39:17.808
We are officially prepared
for the end of the world.

39:17.876 --> 39:19.376
You're eating it now?

39:21.279 --> 39:23.447
You never know.

39:23.481 --> 39:24.848
[Sighs]

39:30.221 --> 39:33.457
Sidecar... and a virgin sidecar.

39:33.491 --> 39:36.260
Mmm. What's in a virgin sidecar?

39:36.294 --> 39:37.728
Basically lemon juice.

39:39.731 --> 39:40.864
Thank you.

39:40.932 --> 39:42.800
Say armageddon really happened.

39:42.834 --> 39:44.067
[Sighs] Not you too.

39:44.102 --> 39:45.736
Well, just as a thought experiment.

39:45.770 --> 39:47.371
The end of the world is nigh.

39:47.405 --> 39:49.740
What would we really need to survive?

39:49.774 --> 39:53.790
Well, my list is a lot shorter than yours.

39:54.015 --> 39:55.088
How do you know?

39:55.297 --> 39:57.431
Because you would give up state secrets

39:57.499 --> 39:59.846
if someone took away
your memory-foam pillow.

39:59.846 --> 40:02.448
That is true. I would
definitely need my pillow.

40:02.448 --> 40:04.182
And a humidifier.

40:04.216 --> 40:06.317
Oh, and can you imagine facing
down the end of the world

40:06.352 --> 40:07.685
with bad cuticles?

40:07.753 --> 40:09.154
Oh, I shudder to think.

40:09.221 --> 40:11.322
Mm, so, yes. A manicure kit.

40:11.357 --> 40:12.590
Of course.

40:12.625 --> 40:14.559
Come on. What would you stockpile?

40:14.673 --> 40:16.007
[Sighs]

40:16.075 --> 40:17.609
Jerky.

40:19.078 --> 40:21.379
Lots and lots of jerky.

40:21.613 --> 40:23.081
I give up.

40:23.115 --> 40:26.184
But don't come crying to
me when you get a hangnail.

40:29.888 --> 40:32.990
[Chuckles] You know, I've been
thinking about what you said...

40:33.025 --> 40:35.660
About planning for the baby's future.

40:35.694 --> 40:36.928
Oh?

40:38.564 --> 40:41.232
If something ever happens to me,

40:41.300 --> 40:43.067
you know, something serious,

40:43.135 --> 40:46.537
I would want you to have the baby.

40:46.605 --> 40:50.508
I mean, would you be willing to do that?

40:50.542 --> 40:53.744
I would be honored.

40:53.779 --> 40:57.215
[Dog barking in distance]

40:57.249 --> 40:58.916
[Glasses clink]

41:01.895 --> 41:04.608
You know, the side-car's surprising cosy.

41:05.350 --> 41:06.648
It's all yours.

41:07.134 --> 41:09.970
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

41:15.266 --> 41:16.747
I've spilled my drink.

41:16.747 --> 41:19.657
- Oh, yeah, I kitchen another one.
- Oh, please, don't.

41:21.371 --> 41:25.794
- Bug... out.
- Bug-out.

41:26.660 --> 41:29.970
- Bug... out.
- Bug-out.
