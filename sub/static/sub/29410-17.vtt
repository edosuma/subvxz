Or that she's trending.

09:46.368 --> 09:47.935
[chuckles] Oh, my God.

09:47.978 --> 09:50.328
This is... Wow.

09:50.372 --> 09:52.461
Deirdre, did Alessa
ever confide in you

09:52.504 --> 09:54.115
about any issues
she was having with Ezra?

09:54.158 --> 09:55.159
"Issues"?

09:55.203 --> 09:56.378
No.

09:56.421 --> 09:57.771
They were the perfect couple.

09:57.814 --> 10:00.251
And professionally,
they were killing it.

10:00.295 --> 10:01.426
Oh.

10:01.470 --> 10:02.776
You're talking
about their brand?

10:02.819 --> 10:03.820
Yeah.

10:03.864 --> 10:05.387
They made it look so easy.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.650
-But they had help.
-Christine?

10:07.694 --> 10:11.436
You know they met her in Monaco
on their babymoon?

10:13.395 --> 10:15.136
Ezra was a bit of a flirt.

10:15.179 --> 10:17.660
I know if I had just given
birth, I wouldn't want

10:17.704 --> 10:20.315
a waif like Christine
in my home, know what I mean?

10:20.358 --> 10:22.143
Deirdre,

10:22.186 --> 10:24.058
would you mind if we asked
your nanny a few questions?

10:24.101 --> 10:25.407
Not about me, right?

10:25.450 --> 10:26.626
No.

10:26.669 --> 10:27.496

10:27.539 --> 10:29.280
Oh.

10:29.324 --> 10:30.673
Of course.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.806
I just keep my head down
and collect my checks.

10:32.849 --> 10:35.330

10:37.027 --> 10:39.900
Do you have any reason
to believe that Christine

10:39.943 --> 10:41.858
and Ezra were sleeping together?

10:41.902 --> 10:43.686
Christine only opened up
to me once.

10:43.730 --> 10:47.168
Said she had bad luck with men,
but "Ezra was different."

10:47.211 --> 10:48.691
He was "one of the good ones."

11:16.153 --> 11:18.547
Eve is helping me search
for the girl that Malcolm found.

11:18.590 --> 11:20.549
The girl in the box.

You really think

11:22.072 --> 11:24.031
-this might be her?
-EVE: Maybe.

11:24.074 --> 11:26.555
Um, her name is Sophie Sanders.

11:26.598 --> 11:29.689
She ran away from a group home
in South Carolina in '94.

11:29.732 --> 11:31.734
Her mother's initials are A.M.S.

11:31.778 --> 11:34.215
Ah. Amelia Sanders.

11:34.258 --> 11:36.826

that her middle initial's "M"?

in South Carolina

adopted you in 1995?

Add attempted baby-napper

is cluster B personalities.
