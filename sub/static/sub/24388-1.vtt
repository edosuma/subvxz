-You should come with me to the office.
-What? Why?

03:33.671 --> 03:35.924
Because we are family.

03:36.007 --> 03:39.510
Can't have my brother ignorant
to the art of business. It's embarrassing.

It'll be fun. I promise.

Do they still have free cookies

-On your desk by Friday.
-Outstanding!

04:35.108 --> 04:36.776
Are they always this friendly?

04:36.859 --> 04:39.696
That's not friendliness.
It's the halo of success.

04:39.779 --> 04:42.657
Tell me, Templeton,
what do I do here at Baby Corp?

04:42.740 --> 04:44.409
You make babies?

04:44.492 --> 04:47.412
Uh, no, the factory downstairs
makes the babies.

04:48.079 --> 04:51.582
I make sure the world loves babies.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.710
More than puppies, more than kittens,

04:53.793 --> 04:56.796
babies get ten times more love
than the competition.

04:56.879 --> 04:58.589
And you know why?

04:59.048 --> 05:01.301
Uh, I was promised fun and cookies.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.593
Ah, stay with me.

05:02.677 --> 05:06.764
It's because of what I've been trying
to tell you. It's all business.

05:07.181 --> 05:10.476
Baby Corp gives the world
the cuteness it needs.

05:10.560 --> 05:15.648
And in return, the world gives us
what we want. All that love.

05:15.732 --> 05:20.111
Wow, you're great at business.
They should let you run Baby Corp.

05:20.528 --> 05:25.325

Ask me why I'm busy.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.382
-I'd rather not.
-Why are you busy?

05:41.466 --> 05:45.219
I'm busy because there's a problem
out in the field, which is what?

05:45.303 --> 05:48.139
Yeah, your job.
Which I guess you're terrible at?

05:48.222 --> 05:51.142
Hey! My brother is great at business.

05:51.225 --> 05:55.980
[gasps] Oh, that's right.
You went off and joined a family.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.106
How's that shaking out?

Oh, it's shaking fine.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.945

to the office? Okay.

but whatevs.

on professionalism,

The whole neighborhood hates him.
And that's very bad for business.

We should help him.

I'll take care of this Scooter Buskie.

07:24.569 --> 07:29.449
Uh, yeah, or else. The "else" means
I take this matter to my bosses.

The Board of Directors.

07:32.785 --> 07:35.913

Take him away? You can't.

Staci, I like the problem-solving
and lack of morals, but the kid's right.

We don't need drastic measures.
What have I been teaching you, Templeton?

10:38.763 --> 10:42.266
That I owe you a favor? I lost interest
after you promised me cookies.

to find out what Scooter Buskie wants.

-No wonder poor baby is so cranky.
-Staci, what do we have for tooth pain?

12:18.946 --> 12:20.156
All better, Scooter?

12:21.198 --> 12:23.033
I can't believe that worked.

12:23.117 --> 12:27.163
I brought you to work because I thought
I could teach you something.

to "one last desperate idea"?

13:36.607 --> 13:41.028
I'll be honest, Templeton. I decided
to go with Staci's factory recall plan.

an awkward family argument.
