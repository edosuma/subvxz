00:15.959 --> 00:18.756
Hey. You think
this could be him?

00:20.108 --> 00:22.109
I wasn't expecting
Scrooge McDuck.

00:22.111 --> 00:25.624
Well, we're about to find out.

00:27.921 --> 00:29.343
Echo-1?

00:29.345 --> 00:30.303
That's us.

00:30.305 --> 00:32.874
You... the guy?
Not me.

00:32.876 --> 00:35.755
I guess we all got the invite.

00:35.757 --> 00:39.047
Anyone else waiting
for the punch line?

00:39.049 --> 00:40.735
Rich guy,

00:40.736 --> 00:42.162
college brat, geriatric

00:42.164 --> 00:44.233
and construction worker
walk into a diner.

00:44.235 --> 00:45.922
Some coffee for you, sir?

00:45.924 --> 00:47.547
Voss, Badoit or Pellegrino.

00:47.549 --> 00:48.818
Pelle... Pelle-what?

00:48.820 --> 00:51.260
Uh, <i>no hablo español.</i>

00:51.262 --> 00:52.329
Sparkling water.

00:52.331 --> 00:54.269
With the bubbles.
Okay.

00:57.147 --> 00:59.017
I'm curious.

01:00.256 --> 01:03.382
I suspect the man who invited us
here must be quite important.

01:03.384 --> 01:04.888
Well, assuming
it's a man.

01:04.890 --> 01:06.007
We've never met him.

01:06.009 --> 01:07.139
Or her.

01:07.141 --> 01:09.353
Got no updates
on the Twitter account.

01:09.355 --> 01:10.634
Hey, snap a pic while we wait.

01:10.636 --> 01:12.863
I don't want my face
on some blog.

01:12.865 --> 01:15.876
Why? Do you have
something to hide?

01:15.878 --> 01:18.371
I like my privacy.
Come on.

01:18.373 --> 01:19.952
Everybody say
"bubbles."

01:19.954 --> 01:22.698
Bubbles.

01:23.531 --> 01:25.394
Moneybags looks
good on camera.

01:25.396 --> 01:27.606
Preserved
for posterity.

01:32.549 --> 01:34.811
Wh-What is this?

01:34.813 --> 01:36.209
Where did everyone go?

01:36.211 --> 01:37.923
Isn't that odd?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.637
Hello?

01:45.517 --> 01:47.223
Hello?

01:54.642 --> 01:57.531
The hell is going on?

01:58.902 --> 02:01.029

get invited here?

He ate some bad sushi

so it made him sick.

Bad sushi?

Mm-hmm.

02:55.261 --> 02:57.909
Okay. He went to Vegas.
He drove back last night.

03:01.285 --> 03:02.568
And he didn't invite you?

03:02.570 --> 03:04.063
No, because I had plans.

have lied about.

03:13.999 --> 03:15.558
He must've taken that model.

03:15.560 --> 03:17.646
She's a fitness model,
not a fashion model,

03:17.648 --> 03:19.632
which means she doesn't
even model actual clothes.

03:19.634 --> 03:21.160
So what does she model?

03:21.162 --> 03:24.284
Energy drinks and fake tattoos.

03:25.220 --> 03:27.160
You actually think he took her?

some bad sushi last night.

I mean, it was so hard to
get out of bed this morning.

03:39.195 --> 03:40.805
And why are you doing this?

03:40.807 --> 03:42.793
Because they know.
They know?

03:42.795 --> 03:44.964
Okay. The only way
they could know

03:44.966 --> 03:46.196
is if a certain person

03:46.198 --> 03:48.169
who watched <i>Pretty in</i>
<i>Pink</i> for the 98th time

03:48.171 --> 03:50.141

We agreed on the "bad sushi"
move, partner.

03:52.756 --> 03:55.270
Well, it turns out they invented
the "bad sushi" move.

03:55.272 --> 03:56.454
That's right.

03:56.456 --> 03:57.933
Really?

Wow, what is...

Sayoc.

04:02.221 --> 04:05.035
Stick grappling.

04:05.037 --> 04:07.049
Yeah. Close-quarter combat.

04:07.051 --> 04:08.686
Oh, I see.
So, what's the plan here?

04:08.688 --> 04:10.569
You gonna go a little
Bruce Lee on me,

04:10.571 --> 04:13.221
'cause you do remember that I
carry a... a weapon, right?

04:13.223 --> 04:14.995
The most common weapons
are blunt objects.

04:15.020 --> 04:16.053
Oh.

04:16.055 --> 04:17.660
Sticks, pipes, bats.

04:17.661 --> 04:19.250
Things like that.

04:19.253 --> 04:20.586
Oh, I see, I see.

04:20.588 --> 04:22.040
Hey, Hetty!

04:23.957 --> 04:25.870
Aah! Ha, ha!
Uh, uncle! <i> El tío!</i>

04:25.872 --> 04:28.264

04:33.757 --> 04:35.037
Yeah, 'cause you know what?

04:35.040 --> 04:39.689
Nothing says fun like
getting choked out with a stick.

04:39.691 --> 04:42.990
Four bodies pulled from the
remains of the Winer n' Diner

04:42.992 --> 04:44.307
in Pasadena.

04:44.309 --> 04:46.210
That place was
closed last year.

04:46.212 --> 04:48.514
Well, someone reopened it
without telling the landlord.

04:48.516 --> 04:50.178
Safe to say there won't
be any Yelp reviews

04:50.180 --> 04:51.660
written in the near future.

04:51.662 --> 04:53.277
We pulled the photo
of the dead men

04:53.279 --> 04:54.895
from the user's
cloud account.

04:54.897 --> 04:56.018
It was taken
before the diner

04:56.020 --> 04:58.144
was leveled by RZX
plastic explosive.

04:58.146 --> 04:59.791
Rigged by pros.

04:59.793 --> 05:02.418
Controlled detonation.

05:02.420 --> 05:05.710
All right, so who are these
guys and who'd they piss off?

05:05.713 --> 05:08.023
Well, it was
an eclectic group.

05:08.025 --> 05:11.630
We have a millionaire,
a college kid, a grandfather

05:11.632 --> 05:14.799
and a man licensed
to drive a bulldozer.

05:14.802 --> 05:17.566
- We're still searching for common enemies.
- All right.

05:17.568 --> 05:19.527
Let's start with connections.

05:19.529 --> 05:21.630
Well, all four victims
followed a Twitter account

05:21.631 --> 05:23.731
linked to the Office
of Naval Intelligence.

05:23.733 --> 05:25.535
And that's
what got them killed.

05:25.538 --> 05:27.899
Computer logs show that each
victim received an invitation

05:27.901 --> 05:30.561
to the diner from this
particular account.

05:30.563 --> 05:32.103
So either

05:32.105 --> 05:33.941
the Navy staged a Twitter ambush

05:33.943 --> 05:35.491
or their account was hacked.

05:35.493 --> 05:36.826
Okay, is anybody else wondering

05:36.828 --> 05:38.327
why the Office
of Naval Intelligence

05:38.329 --> 05:40.077
is on Twitter
in the first place?

05:40.079 --> 05:42.027
Operation: Wide Awake.

05:42.029 --> 05:44.779
It's an experimental project
that uses social media

05:44.781 --> 05:46.530
to reach its participants.

05:46.532 --> 05:48.664
It's designed as
a... strategy game.

05:48.666 --> 05:50.898
Naval Intelligence was
recruiting high-IQ individuals

05:50.900 --> 05:53.499
to test the integrity
of the project.

05:53.501 --> 05:55.141
- Why?
- That's the part we don't know.

05:55.143 --> 05:58.475
Operation: Wide Awake
is currently classified.

05:58.477 --> 06:00.017
So all the victims were players?

06:00.019 --> 06:01.352
Not merely players, Mr. Callen.

06:01.354 --> 06:04.738
They were the elite
of the project.

06:04.740 --> 06:08.766
Naval Intelligence referred
to them as Group Echo-1.

06:08.768 --> 06:11.813
The man behind
the project

06:11.815 --> 06:14.318
has been authorized
to brief you both.

06:14.320 --> 06:15.841
We'll let you know what we find.

06:19.600 --> 06:23.112
Thank you, gentlemen.

06:24.019 --> 06:26.114
I only just found out
about the attack.

06:26.116 --> 06:27.878
I don't understand
who'd want to do this.

06:27.880 --> 06:29.825
The group wasn't even
supposed to know each other.

06:29.827 --> 06:31.093
You don't have any idea

06:31.095 --> 06:33.419
who could access your Twitter
account to stage the ambush?

06:33.421 --> 06:34.986
Your guess
is as good as mine.

06:34.988 --> 06:37.130
Despite all
the protocols in place,

06:37.132 --> 06:38.400
we got hacked.

06:38.402 --> 06:40.924
Tried to trace it,
but hit a dead end.

06:40.926 --> 06:43.380
What is Operation:
Wide Awake exactly?

06:43.382 --> 06:44.699
On the surface,

06:44.701 --> 06:47.338
Wide Awake looks like
an online strategy game,

06:47.340 --> 06:49.581
but in fact, it's potentially
the most advanced

06:49.582 --> 06:52.781
technology we have for
predicting terrorist threats.

06:52.783 --> 06:54.002
Think of all the different ways

06:54.004 --> 06:56.408
someone could attack
this country. Using Wide Awake

06:56.410 --> 06:58.158
could tell us which one
it's most likely to be.

06:58.160 --> 07:00.021
The Pentagon already does that
with threat matrix software.

07:00.023 --> 07:02.813
Computers predict
logical outcomes, Agent Callen,

07:03.337 --> 07:05.674
but we humans
are not always logical.

07:05.676 --> 07:08.350
Wide Awake allows us
to account for both.

07:08.352 --> 07:09.535
How?

07:09.537 --> 07:10.891
Crowd sourcing.

07:10.893 --> 07:13.804
The way thousands of people
play this game enables us

07:13.806 --> 07:16.260
to predict the most likely
course a small group

07:16.262 --> 07:17.903
or even a lone individual

07:17.905 --> 07:19.309
might choose
in predicting a threat.

07:19.311 --> 07:20.782
So, what can
you tell us

07:20.784 --> 07:22.307
about the players that
died this morning?

07:22.309 --> 07:26.372
Group Echo-1
was my elite sample group.

07:26.374 --> 07:27.727
Best of the best.

07:27.729 --> 07:30.658
The brightest individuals
in the crowd tell us the most,

07:30.660 --> 07:33.079
but they're also
the most difficult to find.

07:33.081 --> 07:35.113
And without them?

07:35.115 --> 07:37.230
I'll have to start from scratch.

07:37.232 --> 07:39.770
It'll... set Wide Awake
back years.

07:39.772 --> 07:43.498
People that gifted don't
just turn up every day, but...

07:43.500 --> 07:45.275
But what?

07:45.277 --> 07:49.286
There weren't... four members
of the group.

07:49.288 --> 07:51.406
There were five.

07:54.050 --> 07:55.972
So one of them's
still out there.

07:56.788 --> 07:58.646
It seems so.

08:01.223 --> 08:04.387
Here's the details
he filled out for Wide Awake.

08:04.389 --> 08:07.125
Mike Hoffman. Residential
San Pedro.

08:07.127 --> 08:08.756
Kensi and Deeks
are closer.

08:08.758 --> 08:11.169
Hoffman didn't
show up at the diner.

08:11.171 --> 08:15.084
Does that make him a target
or a suspect, Agent Hanna?

08:16.878 --> 08:18.600
So, uh, tell me.

08:18.602 --> 08:21.895
Did the, uh, ride
over here strike you

08:21.897 --> 08:25.040
as somewhat tense with long,
uncomfortable silences?

08:27.381 --> 08:29.053
Kind of like this?

08:29.055 --> 08:30.341
This about Vegas?

08:31.178 --> 08:33.568
I had other things to do, okay?

08:33.570 --> 08:35.408
Non-Deeks things.

08:35.409 --> 08:37.833
Plus, I'm totally over Vegas.

08:37.836 --> 08:40.292
You've never been to Vegas.
Exactly. Because I'm over it.

08:40.294 --> 08:41.764
Okay, technically,
you can't be over

08:41.765 --> 08:43.186
a place you've
never been to.

08:43.188 --> 08:44.674
Doesn't matter.
Here's the deal.

08:44.676 --> 08:47.316
We're going together.
You and me.

08:49.157 --> 08:51.498
No.
Yeah. Look at me.

08:51.500 --> 08:52.535
It's happening.

08:52.537 --> 08:54.692
No, it isn't.
Vegas.

08:54.694 --> 08:56.361
Vegas.

08:56.363 --> 08:57.795
All right, I get it.

08:57.797 --> 08:59.093
You're afraid
you wouldn't be able

08:59.095 --> 09:01.116
to keep up with me in Vegas.

09:01.118 --> 09:04.743
Oh, I could keep up with you.
Not even close.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.024
I'd bury you.

09:06.026 --> 09:07.643
Okay, so prove it.

09:07.645 --> 09:10.610
Me, you, Vegas.

09:10.612 --> 09:12.297
Okay. You're on.

09:12.299 --> 09:13.696
Bring it, Beach Boy.

09:13.698 --> 09:15.063
You know what they say.

09:15.065 --> 09:17.929
What, uh, happens in Vegas...
Will leave you curled up

09:17.931 --> 09:20.003
in a little fetal position
begging for mercy.

09:20.005 --> 09:21.520
Promise?

09:22.381 --> 09:24.269
So, Hoffman lives
on the third floor.

09:24.271 --> 09:26.849
Outstanding arrest warrants--
check fraud, possession

09:26.851 --> 09:28.569
of counterfeit currency,
misdemeanor assault.

09:28.571 --> 09:30.979
But, supposedly, he's got an
IQ higher than both of us?

09:31.003 --> 09:31.939
Yeah.

09:33.349 --> 09:34.426
Ooh.

09:34.428 --> 09:36.368
Watch it!

09:36.370 --> 09:39.355
Probably a sale on skinny jeans someplace.
What?

09:39.357 --> 09:40.849
'Cause she's a hipster.

09:40.851 --> 09:42.093
She was emo.
Mmm.

09:42.095 --> 09:43.703
I will bet you
Eric's horn-rimmed glasses

09:43.705 --> 09:44.997
that that girl was a hipster.

09:44.999 --> 09:47.370
Is there even a difference?
Yeah.

09:47.372 --> 09:49.561
Of course there's a difference--
they got the... the hair

09:49.563 --> 09:50.838
with the colors and the tight...

09:50.840 --> 09:52.762
I have no idea.
Is there a difference?

09:52.764 --> 09:54.339
You sound seriously uncool
right now.

09:54.341 --> 09:56.147
Whatever. Either way,
she was a cutie.

09:56.149 --> 09:58.073
Oh, my gosh, she looked
like she was 15.

09:58.075 --> 10:00.148
No, I didn't mean
<i>that</i> kind of cute.

10:00.150 --> 10:03.001
Wait a minute, how do you
know that she wasn't 18, huh?

10:03.003 --> 10:04.628
Maybe... maybe she
was just petite.

10:04.630 --> 10:06.536
Maybe your brain
is petite.

10:06.538 --> 10:08.029
Touché.

10:08.031 --> 10:10.220
Kens?

10:11.216 --> 10:13.405
Hey.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.600
The girl.

10:16.602 --> 10:18.545
I got the apartment.
Yep.

10:37.125 --> 10:39.247
Federal agent! Stop!

11:23.419 --> 11:24.705
Manic Pixie Dream Girl?

11:24.707 --> 11:26.024
Slipped away.

11:27.151 --> 11:28.436
For now.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.414
You check that laptop?
I'm going to have it

11:30.416 --> 11:32.698
bagged for Eric,
let him do the honors.

11:32.700 --> 11:35.754
So, we got no wallet, no I.D.

11:35.756 --> 11:38.569
and obviously
a hell of a struggle.

11:38.571 --> 11:40.580
That's fatal head trauma.

11:40.582 --> 11:43.153
Bad fall would do it.

11:43.155 --> 11:44.388
Right there.

11:44.390 --> 11:47.184
Slammed his head on the
edge of the coffee table.

11:47.186 --> 11:49.126
Or she could've slammed it for him.
He's twice her size.

11:49.128 --> 11:51.346
If anything,
she was in survival mode.

11:51.348 --> 11:53.813
Running from the scene
and leaving a trail of blood

11:53.815 --> 11:55.606
makes her look pretty guilty.

11:55.608 --> 11:57.631
We don't know anything about her.

11:57.633 --> 11:59.243
Exactly.

11:59.245 --> 12:01.365
You've been busy.
Yeah.

12:01.367 --> 12:03.191
This Hoffman?

12:03.193 --> 12:04.672
No, sir.

12:04.674 --> 12:06.975
This is Hoffman.

12:06.977 --> 12:09.011
We're still waiting on
the I.D. for the body.

12:09.013 --> 12:11.387
Hoffman didn't get hit at
the diner like the rest of them.

12:11.389 --> 12:14.050
Maybe this guy was sent
to finish the job.

12:14.052 --> 12:15.493
Holster, no gun.

12:15.495 --> 12:18.971
Manic Pixie Dream Girl
must've taken it.

12:18.973 --> 12:20.380
She had a small backpack.

12:20.382 --> 12:22.077
"Manic Pixie Dream Girl"?

12:22.925 --> 12:25.164
I think her name is Astrid.

12:26.642 --> 12:29.526
And she clearly knew Hoffman.

12:29.528 --> 12:30.979
Yeah, Eric?

12:30.981 --> 12:33.160
All right, still waiting
for an I.D. on your body.

12:33.162 --> 12:34.334
Hoffman's cell phone's
been switched off.

12:34.336 --> 12:35.324
No signal, no trail.

12:35.326 --> 12:37.307
Does Hoffman have any family?

12:37.309 --> 12:39.156
Negative. Everything we've got
indicates he's a loner.

12:39.158 --> 12:41.519
Speaking of social connections,

12:41.521 --> 12:43.767
I just got the results
from a deeper round of profiling

12:43.769 --> 12:44.906
on the diner victims.

12:44.908 --> 12:46.806
This morning was the first time
any of them met.

12:47.665 --> 12:49.449
Dr. Mathers' story checks out.

12:49.451 --> 12:51.432
The group didn't know
each other.

12:51.434 --> 12:53.150
So, besides
Operation: Wide Awake,

12:53.152 --> 12:54.901
the doctor was their only link.

12:54.903 --> 12:56.783
Which means
he could be a target, too.

12:57.710 --> 13:00.436
Send us any updates
on Hoffman and the girl.

13:00.438 --> 13:02.616
Done.

13:09.274 --> 13:12.606
Where did you go?

13:18.508 --> 13:20.329
I'm sorry,
I don't recognize

13:20.331 --> 13:21.510
any of them.

13:21.512 --> 13:22.899
All of Wide Awake's
communication

13:22.901 --> 13:24.339
was conducted online.

13:24.341 --> 13:25.554
They were just names

13:25.556 --> 13:27.533
on a screen.
Which is why none of them

13:27.535 --> 13:28.974
met in person
till this morning.

13:28.976 --> 13:31.127
Who else knew about Wide Awake?

13:31.129 --> 13:33.000
The only people who ever
saw the whole program

13:33.002 --> 13:34.423
were those skilled enough
to play through

13:34.425 --> 13:35.604
every one of its levels:

13:35.606 --> 13:36.992
Group Echo-1.

13:36.994 --> 13:39.388
And now the only ones
with that knowledge

13:39.390 --> 13:40.463
are you and Hoffman.

13:40.465 --> 13:41.730
Yeah.

13:42.635 --> 13:45.020
There's someone else.

13:46.713 --> 13:49.293
I've been getting...
help from a friend

13:49.294 --> 13:51.227
on the outside.

13:51.229 --> 13:53.162
A Pentagon analyst

13:53.164 --> 13:56.015
named George Toretto.

13:56.017 --> 13:57.837
I wanted to see how it was doing

13:57.839 --> 13:59.965
against the best
threat matrix in the world.

13:59.967 --> 14:01.706
So you asked him
to compare your results

14:01.708 --> 14:03.963
against the Pentagon's
classified threat intelligence.

14:03.965 --> 14:06.543
You broke security protocols
to beta-test your program.

14:06.545 --> 14:08.912
And in doing so, not only
compromised your entire project

14:08.914 --> 14:10.605
but four innocent people
were killed.

14:10.607 --> 14:13.459
I never thought anyone
would get hurt, Agent Callen.

14:13.461 --> 14:16.974
My research is designed
to save lives.

14:16.976 --> 14:19.143
Do you realize what's at stake?

14:19.145 --> 14:20.786
If Wide Awake goes operational,

14:20.788 --> 14:23.383
it will make our country
a safer place.

14:23.385 --> 14:24.731
What did Toretto tell you?

14:24.733 --> 14:27.262
Well, that's... the problem.

14:27.264 --> 14:30.253
He never gave me
the results.

14:30.255 --> 14:32.504
We're going to increase security
at this lab.

14:32.506 --> 14:34.032
If you contact Toretto,

14:34.034 --> 14:36.727
the two of you
will end up sharing a cell.

14:36.729 --> 14:39.192
Am I in danger, Agent Hanna?

14:41.346 --> 14:44.814
Not if you stay put.

14:44.815 --> 14:48.001
I'll get Eric to pull everything
he can on this guy, Toretto.

14:49.350 --> 14:51.896
Stop. Stop. You can't go
in there with your bag.

14:51.898 --> 14:52.948
We got to check it.

14:52.950 --> 14:54.263
Hey!

14:54.265 --> 14:55.298
Hey!

14:56.631 --> 14:58.291
Stop that girl!

14:59.148 --> 15:00.808
Stop that girl!

15:12.913 --> 15:15.515
She came here for a reason.

15:16.354 --> 15:17.595
Looks like Wide Awake

15:17.597 --> 15:20.500
isn't as big a secret
as Dr. Mathers thinks.

15:26.997 --> 15:29.514
So, security team
at the Naval Intelligence Lab

15:29.516 --> 15:31.043
says Astrid tried
to slip through

15:31.045 --> 15:33.174
a metal detector
and triggered the alarm.

15:33.176 --> 15:35.725
Maybe the gun she stole off the
dead guy was in her backpack.

15:35.727 --> 15:37.421
Or maybe she's a girl
who was never briefed

15:37.423 --> 15:39.133
on security protocol--
she saw the alarms,

15:39.135 --> 15:40.947
men trying to detain her,
and she ran.

15:40.949 --> 15:42.457
Maybe.

15:42.459 --> 15:44.622
What else do we know about her?
Neighbors said

15:44.624 --> 15:46.318
they started seeing
Hoffman and Astrid together

15:46.320 --> 15:48.618
a few months ago,
but they kept to themselves.

15:48.620 --> 15:50.515
She had her own room
in Hoffman's apartment,

15:50.517 --> 15:52.848
but we found no personal items,
just some clothes.

15:52.850 --> 15:54.661
Sounds like a girl on the run.

15:54.663 --> 15:56.885
Okay, so why do you run
to a military facility?

15:56.887 --> 15:58.370
Looking for someone--
a friend, maybe?

15:58.372 --> 16:00.559
Hey. Hoffman's laptop.
Searched the e-mail archives,

16:00.561 --> 16:03.812
but the entire account's
been wiped by a pro.

16:03.814 --> 16:06.002
Anything else on the computer?

16:06.004 --> 16:09.374
The most recent version of the
Wide Awake gaming application.

16:11.177 --> 16:12.693
Now we're talking.

16:12.695 --> 16:15.188
Nell uploaded the file
on Dr. Mathers'

16:15.190 --> 16:17.041
Pentagon buddy,
George Toretto.

16:17.043 --> 16:19.248
Red flag in his bank accounts.

16:19.250 --> 16:21.274
$100,000 deposited
five days ago.

16:21.276 --> 16:24.051
All cash, no paper trail.

16:24.052 --> 16:26.157
Wide Awake's technology
predicts attacks on America

16:26.159 --> 16:27.807
before they happen.

16:27.809 --> 16:29.195
There's plenty
of well-funded groups

16:29.197 --> 16:31.057
that would like to see it fail.

16:31.059 --> 16:33.312
Not to mention
rogue governments.

16:33.314 --> 16:36.496
Maybe someone's paying Toretto
to sabotage the program.

16:38.588 --> 16:41.445
This is the building.

16:42.509 --> 16:44.450
You got to be kidding me.

16:44.452 --> 16:45.757
That's our guy.
That's Toretto.

16:45.759 --> 16:47.243
Something must have
tipped them off.

16:47.245 --> 16:49.938
He's a popular guy.

16:53.925 --> 16:55.818
♪ ♪

17:03.839 --> 17:06.794
Going to crash.
Please don't.

17:06.796 --> 17:08.098
Not us. Him.

17:34.733 --> 17:36.984
Driver's dead.
Toretto?

17:37.833 --> 17:39.628
Gone.

17:57.150 --> 17:59.352
We I.D.'d the body found
at Hoffman's apartment.

17:59.354 --> 18:01.523
Max Naylor.
He did time at Folsom Prison

18:01.525 --> 18:04.166
with the driver who was killed
in the car crash.

18:04.168 --> 18:06.419
Uh, he also has experience
in demolitions,

18:06.421 --> 18:08.213
which explains the diner.

18:08.215 --> 18:09.926
Both were guns for hire.

18:09.928 --> 18:12.441
Well, if someone hired them
to sabotage Wide Awake,

18:12.443 --> 18:13.842
Hoffman would be
the next logical target.

18:13.844 --> 18:15.703
Unless he was
the one behind this.

18:15.705 --> 18:17.710
Hoffman and Dr. Mathers
are the only ones left

18:17.712 --> 18:19.555
who understand how
this technology works.

18:19.557 --> 18:22.067
Well, then Mathers might want to
step up the security at his lab.

18:22.069 --> 18:23.064
It's already done.

18:23.066 --> 18:24.564
Nell, confirm his location.

18:24.566 --> 18:26.033
On it.

18:26.035 --> 18:27.420
What about Toretto?

18:27.422 --> 18:30.077
The $100K in his account
had to come from somewhere.

18:30.079 --> 18:31.788
Well, Toretto's got
the financial connections;

18:31.790 --> 18:32.984
Hoffman's got
the insider knowledge.

18:32.986 --> 18:34.593
Maybe they were partners.

18:34.596 --> 18:36.802
Hoffman got greedy,
took out a hit.

18:36.804 --> 18:38.910
Doesn't explain the dead guy
in Hoffman's apartment.

18:38.912 --> 18:40.787
Maybe Toretto tried
to get to Hoffman first.

18:40.789 --> 18:43.062
Or the guy was there
to kill Astrid.

18:43.064 --> 18:45.554
She showed up
at the Naval Intelligence Lab,

18:45.556 --> 18:47.761
which means she knows
something about Wide Awake.

18:48.759 --> 18:50.369
Hoffman's cell phone
was just switched on.

18:50.371 --> 18:51.587
I got the signal.

18:54.590 --> 18:58.400
Hoffman's at a bus stop
on Pico Boulevard in West L.A.

18:58.402 --> 18:59.996
The signal means
we can get remote access.

18:59.998 --> 19:01.712
Does the phone have
a front-facing camera?

19:01.714 --> 19:03.170
Roger that.
Call it.

19:03.172 --> 19:05.315
Grab an image
of the person that answers.

19:07.119 --> 19:09.381
- Got it.
- That's not Hoffman.

19:09.384 --> 19:11.664
Hello?

19:11.666 --> 19:13.019
She disconnected the call.

19:13.021 --> 19:15.645
Call her back.
Wait a minute, what's the plan here?

19:15.648 --> 19:17.619
I mean, what are you
going to say to her?

19:17.621 --> 19:18.700
"If you're not killing
everybody involved

19:18.702 --> 19:20.021
"in a top secret
governmental program,

19:20.023 --> 19:22.252
"maybe you can come over
and watch <i>Pretty in Pink,</i>

19:22.254 --> 19:23.265
we can eat some Oreos"?

19:23.267 --> 19:24.637
This might be
the only chance we get,

19:24.639 --> 19:26.628
and I think I can
get her to talk to me.

19:26.630 --> 19:29.244
Why?

19:30.095 --> 19:31.928
Because she's scared.

19:31.930 --> 19:33.711
You've found the girl.

19:33.713 --> 19:35.345
Yes.

19:35.347 --> 19:36.711
Astrid is on the run

19:36.713 --> 19:39.127
and she knows
about Operation Wide Awake.

19:39.129 --> 19:41.711
We have a chance to talk to her.

19:41.713 --> 19:42.876
But Mr. Deeks believes

19:42.878 --> 19:45.543
your emotions
are clouding your judgment.

19:45.545 --> 19:46.793
Well, that's

19:46.795 --> 19:48.760
a little harsh, but...

19:48.762 --> 19:50.376
yeah.

19:52.427 --> 19:55.202
Call the girl,
Mr. Beale.

19:55.204 --> 19:58.258
Maybe she'll see in you
what you see in her,

19:58.260 --> 19:59.276
Miss Blye.

19:59.278 --> 20:01.050
All right,
I got Astrid

20:01.052 --> 20:02.988
on a traffic cam
at that intersection.

20:04.075 --> 20:05.271
Hello?

20:05.273 --> 20:06.881
Hi, Astrid.

20:06.883 --> 20:08.836
My name is Kensi.

20:08.838 --> 20:10.511
I was at your
apartment building today.

20:10.513 --> 20:12.220
I'm so sorry if I scared you.

20:12.222 --> 20:13.682
You didn't scare me.

20:13.684 --> 20:16.360
Well, I know you've had
a hard time today.

20:16.362 --> 20:18.659
I thought you might
like to talk.

20:18.661 --> 20:19.727
I don't.

20:19.729 --> 20:22.093
Well, then maybe
you need a friend?

20:22.095 --> 20:24.326
You don't really know me.

20:24.328 --> 20:26.758
No, I don't,
but I'd very much like to.

20:26.760 --> 20:30.060
Why don't you start by telling
me something about yourself.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.457
You're tracing this call.

20:33.986 --> 20:36.614
Okay... let's start
with me, then.

20:36.616 --> 20:37.879
Um...

20:37.881 --> 20:40.709
I'm single...

20:40.711 --> 20:43.473
and totally over Vegas.

20:43.475 --> 20:46.812
I love <i>Pretty in Pink</i> and Oreos.

20:46.814 --> 20:49.230
No one's trying to hurt me;
they're trying to hurt Mike.

20:49.232 --> 20:51.189
And where is Mike right now?

20:51.191 --> 20:53.640
He's enjoying the art
of civilized bushwhacking.

20:53.642 --> 20:55.647
I have to go now.
No, no...

20:55.649 --> 20:56.667
Astrid...

20:56.669 --> 20:57.654
Phone's been turned off.

20:57.656 --> 20:58.904
No signal to track.

20:58.906 --> 21:00.944
By the time we get there,
she'll be long gone.

21:00.946 --> 21:02.753
Anyone understand
what she was talking about?

21:02.755 --> 21:04.696
The "art of
civilized bushwhacking"

21:04.698 --> 21:07.706
is an old term
for the game of poker.

21:07.708 --> 21:11.736
Don't ask me how I know that.

21:12.807 --> 21:15.471
Eric, pull up
Hoffman's finances.

21:18.566 --> 21:20.489
He's made seven withdrawals

21:20.491 --> 21:22.924
from the Hollywood Park
Casino ATM in the past month.

21:22.926 --> 21:25.457
Sounds like a guy
with a gambling probleto me.

21:25.459 --> 21:27.037
Sounds like a motive.

21:27.039 --> 21:28.550
Eric, bring up
the security cameras

21:28.552 --> 21:30.113
at the Hollywood Park Casino.

21:30.115 --> 21:32.083
Maybe he's still there.

21:38.081 --> 21:40.050
Done.
Thank you.

21:42.459 --> 21:45.356
Mr. Deeks.

21:45.358 --> 21:47.208
Hey, um...

21:47.210 --> 21:49.987
you knew that putting Kensi
on the phone with Astrid

21:49.989 --> 21:51.621
was the right call.

21:51.623 --> 21:54.720
And you want to know
how I knew that.

21:54.722 --> 21:56.135
If you don't think
that I need to know, then...

21:56.161 --> 21:57.652
No, no, no.

21:57.653 --> 22:00.210
After her father died,

22:00.212 --> 22:02.704
she, uh, ran away.

22:02.706 --> 22:06.375
She lived on the streets
for almost a year.

22:08.262 --> 22:10.704
I didn't know that.

22:10.706 --> 22:14.123
And I, Mr. Deeks,
didn't tell you.

22:15.032 --> 22:17.172
'Course not.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.439
Miss Jones.

22:20.441 --> 22:22.628
With me.

22:22.630 --> 22:24.346
Okay.

22:29.063 --> 22:30.914
But that's your seat.

22:30.916 --> 22:33.559
Indeed.

22:35.128 --> 22:37.922
Okay, this is
a test, right?

22:37.924 --> 22:40.137
You're looking to
see my response?

22:40.139 --> 22:42.981
This is a chair, Miss Jones.

22:42.983 --> 22:45.014
Sit in it.

22:46.123 --> 22:47.825
Fair enough.

22:51.164 --> 22:53.644
Wow. Yeah, it's, uh...

22:53.646 --> 22:56.753
it's really...
oh, it's comfortable.

22:56.755 --> 22:58.539
I've been told

22:58.541 --> 23:01.349
that you have a very high IQ.

23:01.351 --> 23:04.524
Higher, in fact,
than any other person

23:04.526 --> 23:06.706
currently employed
by NCIS.

23:06.708 --> 23:09.368
Well, it's just a number
with a range of variables

23:09.370 --> 23:12.923
prone to cultural bias, so...
Prove it.

23:16.346 --> 23:18.709
You want me to play
Operation: Wide Awake?

23:18.710 --> 23:20.924
Those four men
at the diner

23:20.926 --> 23:24.446
were killed because
of something they discovered

23:24.448 --> 23:26.760
with this program.

23:26.762 --> 23:30.993
I need you to find out
what that was.

23:30.995 --> 23:32.927
All right.

23:42.352 --> 23:45.493
...Texas hold 'em tournament this Friday.

23:45.495 --> 23:48.386
Players may register at the
members' service desk or online.

23:48.388 --> 23:49.592
Excuse me.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.151
Pardon me.
Pardon me.

23:52.325 --> 23:55.761
Now, that's what I call
two well-mannered young man.

23:55.763 --> 23:58.643
Someone certainly
taught <i>them</i> well.

23:58.645 --> 24:00.956
What a handsome couple they are.

24:00.958 --> 24:03.302
Where'd that brunette
get those legs?

24:03.304 --> 24:05.280
Just remember, boys,

24:05.282 --> 24:07.307
you got to know when to hold 'em.

24:07.309 --> 24:08.615
You've been singing
that stupid song

24:08.617 --> 24:09.839
the entire ride
over here.

24:09.841 --> 24:11.632
Mmm, okay, it's
not a stupid song.

24:11.634 --> 24:13.023
That's "The Gambler"
by Kenny Rogers,

24:13.025 --> 24:14.314
aka the Silver Fox.

24:14.316 --> 24:15.906
Ah, Charlie Rich
was the Silver Fox.

24:15.907 --> 24:17.866
I'm pretty sure
it was Kenny Rogers.

24:17.868 --> 24:19.727
It's Charlie Rich.
Any luck, Eric?

24:19.729 --> 24:20.849
Jackpot.

24:20.851 --> 24:22.326
I got him at
poker table number four.

24:22.328 --> 24:23.950
Striped short-sleeved shirt.

24:25.930 --> 24:27.837
Kensi, Deeks...

24:27.839 --> 24:30.699
why don't you
do your thing.

24:30.701 --> 24:32.998
First date?
Last date.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.163
Is this because
I didn't take you to Vegas?

24:35.165 --> 24:36.781
Because we are
in the casino now.

24:36.783 --> 24:39.218
Mmm... that's why
I need to upgrade.

24:39.220 --> 24:42.114
Kensi? Kensi?

24:43.734 --> 24:46.800
My friend hates
it when I gamble.

24:47.755 --> 24:49.610
Life's a gamble.

24:49.612 --> 24:52.115
No.

24:52.117 --> 24:53.685
Fern?

24:53.687 --> 24:55.751
Fern. What-what
are you doing here?

24:55.753 --> 24:57.454
Are you trying
to make me jealous?

24:57.456 --> 24:59.056
See, he went to Vegas,

24:59.058 --> 25:01.501
and he thinks that this
is gonna make up for it.

25:01.503 --> 25:05.220
I'd never go anywhere
without you.

25:05.222 --> 25:06.904
He's clearly playing
way out of his league.

25:06.906 --> 25:09.301
Okay, you know what I love?
I love it when people

25:09.303 --> 25:11.284
talk about me like I'm not
standing right behind them.

25:11.286 --> 25:14.127
And the fish hooks
take it.

25:14.129 --> 25:19.382
So... are you just lucky, or
are you really, really good?

25:19.384 --> 25:22.324
I'm really, really good.

25:22.326 --> 25:25.580
But, uh... I'm <i>looking</i>
to get lucky.

25:25.582 --> 25:27.148
Okay.
You know what?

25:27.150 --> 25:29.893
I love... I love a little butter
with my cheese.

25:29.895 --> 25:32.238
I'm going to grab a soda.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.007
Buy you a drink?

25:34.009 --> 25:36.436
Yeah. Shaggy won't
stop bugging me

25:36.438 --> 25:38.023
if I stick around.

25:38.025 --> 25:40.998
Then maybe...
we should leave.

25:42.816 --> 25:44.798
Maybe we should.

25:45.708 --> 25:47.998
Thank you, sir.

25:51.208 --> 25:54.068
Genius-level IQ, huh?

25:54.070 --> 25:55.387
Oh, crap.

25:55.389 --> 25:57.561
Luck's run out, Hoffman.

25:57.563 --> 25:59.903
I knew it was too
good to be true.

25:59.905 --> 26:02.293
Figured my chances were 50-50.

26:02.295 --> 26:03.765
Just to be clear,

26:03.767 --> 26:06.088
I am, uh, totally
in your league.

26:06.090 --> 26:08.029
In your dreams.
All the time, darling.

26:08.031 --> 26:10.152
All the time.

26:10.154 --> 26:12.053
What do you
got, Eric?

26:14.543 --> 26:16.656
Mathers is gone.

26:17.551 --> 26:20.396
Gave his protective
detail the slip.

26:31.798 --> 26:33.585
So, it was all an act?

26:33.587 --> 26:37.700
Even that whole "are you
lucky or just good" bit?

26:37.702 --> 26:39.814
Act.
Ah.

26:39.816 --> 26:41.602
Well, I'm impressed.

26:41.604 --> 26:43.065
The four
other people

26:43.067 --> 26:44.660
in Echo-1 are dead.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.838
Operation: Wide Awake.
Yeah.

26:48.839 --> 26:51.765
Never heard of it.

26:51.767 --> 26:53.392
Hey, that's my laptop.

26:53.394 --> 26:56.074
Wow, nothing gets by this one.
Mmm.

26:56.076 --> 26:58.969
Wide Awake application's
installed on the hard drive.

26:58.971 --> 27:01.554
Why don't you play it for us?
Let's see what you got.

27:01.556 --> 27:04.335
Well, if it doesn't involve...

27:04.337 --> 27:08.220
dice or cards, I'll probably
need an instruction manual.

27:08.222 --> 27:10.465
- Preferably one with pictures.
- Okay, there is

27:10.467 --> 27:12.645
no way this is our fifth man.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.969
This looks like one of the games
Astrid likes to play.

27:16.971 --> 27:20.742
Okay. Who exactly is Astrid?

27:20.744 --> 27:23.392
I, uh...

27:23.394 --> 27:26.453
I don't know.

27:26.455 --> 27:28.998
I <i>think</i> she's my daughter.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.883
You think?

27:30.885 --> 27:33.171
She's different.

27:33.172 --> 27:35.475
She, uh, barely speaks.

27:35.477 --> 27:37.519
She's really good at math.

27:37.521 --> 27:39.775
She spends hours
on this computer.

27:39.777 --> 27:42.207
I took her to the casino
a few weeks back

27:42.209 --> 27:44.786
and taught her how to gamble.

27:44.788 --> 27:46.557
Astrid never loses.

27:46.559 --> 27:48.571
I mean, like... ever.

27:48.573 --> 27:50.827
The art of civilized
bushwhacking.

27:50.828 --> 27:53.355
Yeah, that's what we call poker.

27:53.357 --> 27:55.498
Hey, you...
you talked to her?

27:55.500 --> 27:56.951
Where is she?

27:56.953 --> 27:58.787
We were hoping
you could help us find that out.

27:58.789 --> 28:02.760
Well, I was on an 18-hour streak
at the casino when you found me.

28:02.762 --> 28:06.748
Hey, I gave her my cell phone
in case of an emergency.

28:06.750 --> 28:11.055
No, trust me, that girl knows
how to take care of herself.

28:11.057 --> 28:13.259
She's okay, right?

28:18.100 --> 28:20.403
Mathers still hasn't
gone back to his office.

28:20.405 --> 28:22.957
If Astrid <i>was</i> using
Hoffman's laptop and e-mail,

28:22.959 --> 28:24.660
all of her Wide Awake
activity

28:24.662 --> 28:26.279
would've looked like it
was coming from him.

28:26.281 --> 28:29.751
Dr. Mathers would have had
no way of knowing it was her.

28:29.753 --> 28:32.472
Maybe this girl has
some form of autism.

28:32.474 --> 28:33.857
Asperger's syndrome.

28:33.859 --> 28:35.644
That would explain a lot.

28:35.646 --> 28:37.480
Well, we'd need a formal
diagnosis to be sure,

28:37.482 --> 28:39.466
but Astrid seems
to fit the profile.

28:39.468 --> 28:41.412
Social awkwardness,
limited empathy,

28:41.414 --> 28:43.005
a savant's gift for numbers.

28:43.007 --> 28:44.330
Yeah, but clearly
high-functioning enough

28:44.332 --> 28:46.478
to defend herself
and evade us.

28:46.480 --> 28:48.456
Whoever wanted the rest
of the team members dead

28:48.458 --> 28:49.547
still thinks that
Hoffman's the target,

28:49.549 --> 28:51.677
not Astrid-- so as long
as no one finds out,

28:51.679 --> 28:53.052
Astrid is safe.

28:53.054 --> 28:55.753
And only two people had access
to Hoffman's data:

28:55.754 --> 28:58.017
Dr. Mathers and Toretto.

28:58.019 --> 29:00.566
Eric, send us
Dr. Mathers' home address.

29:01.321 --> 29:03.216
You two keep talking
to Hoffman.

29:03.218 --> 29:04.894
If anyone can help us
find Astrid, it's him.

29:04.919 --> 29:06.324
Okay.

29:09.792 --> 29:14.906
Anyone add up all those
outstanding warrants I've got?

29:14.908 --> 29:16.873
I did.

29:16.875 --> 29:19.989
I figure I'm looking
at five years in prison.

29:19.991 --> 29:21.443
That's if I'm lucky.

29:21.469 --> 29:23.073
Well, I think we've
pretty much established

29:23.074 --> 29:26.621
the only kind of luck
that you have is bad.

29:26.623 --> 29:28.571
Bad luck doesn't
make you a bad guy.

29:28.573 --> 29:30.987
Just a bad father.

29:30.989 --> 29:33.786
Look, it all happened so fast.

29:33.788 --> 29:37.369
I-I never had the chance
to get the hang of it.

29:37.371 --> 29:40.519
And it's too late to start now.

29:42.536 --> 29:46.401
Promise me that
you'll make sure Astrid is okay

29:46.403 --> 29:48.685
when I get locked up.

29:48.687 --> 29:50.784
We're not cutting any deals.

30:04.149 --> 30:06.116
I hope you don't feel

30:06.118 --> 30:08.898
I'm putting pressure
on you, Miss Jones.

30:10.615 --> 30:13.647
Nope. Nope, I'm fine.

30:15.014 --> 30:17.647
Let me know
when you're finished.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.863
Mm-hmm. I'm...

30:19.865 --> 30:23.031
still... still working,

30:23.033 --> 30:24.472
so...

30:25.915 --> 30:28.489
Yeah, no, this is not
going to happen.

30:28.491 --> 30:29.845
I'm... sorry.

30:29.847 --> 30:32.777
I... I thought I was
doing something wrong,

30:32.779 --> 30:34.472
but this is not me.

30:34.474 --> 30:36.302
This is program.

30:36.304 --> 30:37.691
When you reach the final level,

30:37.694 --> 30:39.352
the engine used
to predict the threats

30:39.354 --> 30:41.759
completely falls apart,
which means...

30:41.761 --> 30:46.335
Operation: Wide Awake
doesn't work.

30:48.201 --> 30:51.504
Could it be that Dr. Mathers
didn't know about this?

30:51.506 --> 30:54.861
Highly unlikely.

30:57.437 --> 30:59.351
Wow.

30:59.353 --> 31:02.398
Astrid-- how do we find her?

31:02.400 --> 31:04.459
I don't know.

31:04.461 --> 31:06.468
How could you not know?
She's your daughter?

31:06.470 --> 31:09.731
She just showed up on
my doorstep a few months back.

31:09.733 --> 31:13.965
She told me her mom died
and left her my address.

31:13.967 --> 31:16.601
I recognized
her mom's name, but...

31:16.602 --> 31:20.769
We were just kids
when her mom got pregnant.

31:20.771 --> 31:24.872
I promised her we'd
work something out, but...

31:24.874 --> 31:27.475
instead, I did a runner.

31:28.299 --> 31:30.770
Not my finest moment.

31:30.772 --> 31:34.608
So when Astrid told me
who her mother was,

31:34.610 --> 31:38.216
I... I couldn't turn her away.

31:38.218 --> 31:39.996
Because you felt guilty?

31:39.998 --> 31:43.538
Look, I don't even know for sure
that she's my daughter.

31:43.540 --> 31:45.813
And I told Astrid that.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.810
But she just...

31:50.812 --> 31:52.939
looked at me...

31:52.941 --> 31:55.962
with those big eyes.

31:55.964 --> 31:58.934
I mean, she just
wore me down, you know?

31:58.936 --> 32:01.196
What can I say?

32:01.198 --> 32:03.062
So, um...

32:03.064 --> 32:06.200
I gave her a room
and I let her stay.

32:07.422 --> 32:10.723
Did you ever take back
what you said?

32:10.725 --> 32:13.051
About not being her father?

32:17.791 --> 32:19.905
Listen...

32:19.907 --> 32:23.405
this isn't about me
trying to cut a deal here.

32:23.407 --> 32:26.707
I know I have nothing
to offer you.

32:29.187 --> 32:33.015
My life has been one big gamble
with no payoff.

32:33.017 --> 32:34.518
Maybe Astrid's the payoff.

32:34.520 --> 32:37.275
I blew that, too.

32:38.977 --> 32:42.724
I know I might not be...

32:42.726 --> 32:46.440
the best person for Astrid...

32:46.442 --> 32:49.412
but she still needs someone
looking after her.

33:12.992 --> 33:14.973
I'm fine.

33:16.708 --> 33:18.758
I know.

33:18.760 --> 33:21.279
I'm just getting
some water.

33:49.609 --> 33:52.382
Looks like
Mathers is home.

33:56.502 --> 33:58.148
Or not.

33:58.150 --> 34:00.989
Someone broke in.

34:00.991 --> 34:03.091
Take the front.

34:03.093 --> 34:05.461
I'll cut him off
from behind.

34:17.483 --> 34:19.667
Federal agent!
Don't move, Toretto!

34:23.786 --> 34:26.139
You need to hear it twice?

34:27.855 --> 34:30.242
You won't shoot me.

34:30.244 --> 34:33.621
I'm the only one
that can give you answers.

34:34.547 --> 34:36.478
No one's getting shot.

34:36.481 --> 34:39.212
See?

34:40.983 --> 34:42.721
Just relax.

34:42.723 --> 34:45.337
Now, put it down.
You try and get past him,

34:45.339 --> 34:47.704
you're going to wish I shot you.

34:55.636 --> 34:57.952
When I tell Deeks about this,
you better vouch for me.

34:57.954 --> 34:59.689
You went Bruce Lee on his ass.

34:59.691 --> 35:01.677
I'll vouch
for you.

35:05.153 --> 35:07.354
Mathers is the one you want.
What are you doing here?

35:07.356 --> 35:08.580
Look, he's trying
to kill me.

35:08.582 --> 35:10.897
I came here to try
and talk some sense into him.

35:10.899 --> 35:12.521
It's complicated.

35:12.523 --> 35:14.870
Oh, yeah?

35:14.872 --> 35:16.824
Wide Awake doesn't work.

35:16.826 --> 35:18.678
Neither one of you knew

35:18.680 --> 35:20.218
till Mathers
gave you his results

35:20.220 --> 35:21.773
to compare
to the Pentagon's intel.

35:21.775 --> 35:23.895
He paid you $100,000
to keep quiet.

35:23.897 --> 35:25.448
Mathers wanted the results
to look successful.

35:25.450 --> 35:27.036
And you taking
that hush money

35:27.038 --> 35:29.627
means you'd get charged with
treason if people found out,

35:29.629 --> 35:31.297
which is why you
didn't go public

35:31.299 --> 35:32.802
when bodies started
turning up today.

35:32.804 --> 35:35.676
I wasn't the only one who knew
Wide Awake was a failure.

35:35.678 --> 35:37.230
There was some guy
in Mathers' test group

35:37.232 --> 35:38.553
who actually e-mailed him,
tried to call him out on it.

35:38.578 --> 35:39.738
Hoffman.

35:39.739 --> 35:42.244
Yeah. Mathers never
heard from him again.

35:42.246 --> 35:45.402
He got worried others in the
group would figure it out.

35:45.404 --> 35:47.959
So he lured them
to the diner this morning.

35:47.961 --> 35:50.432
I didn't think he was
going to kill them.

35:50.434 --> 35:53.088
I thought he was going
to try to buy them off.

35:53.090 --> 35:55.144
And then that guy
came after me.

35:55.146 --> 35:56.949
Where's Mathers now?

35:56.951 --> 35:59.406
I don't know.

36:00.776 --> 36:02.415
So, Callen and Sam
have Toretto.

36:02.417 --> 36:04.385
Looks like Mathers
offed his own test group.

36:04.387 --> 36:05.973
Good thing we just
found him, then.

36:05.975 --> 36:07.794
My lovely assistant
will take it from here.

36:07.796 --> 36:08.857
Assistant?

36:08.859 --> 36:10.104
Uh, colleague.

36:10.105 --> 36:11.582
They can be lovely, too.

36:11.584 --> 36:13.152
Mathers' cell's online.

36:13.154 --> 36:14.424
He just received a call
from Hoffman's phone.

36:14.425 --> 36:16.563
Their call lasted 30 seconds;
Hoffman's phone went dark

36:16.565 --> 36:18.380
immediately afterwards,
but Mathers is still online.

36:18.382 --> 36:19.488
He's headed
for the casino.

36:19.490 --> 36:20.488
That's Hoffman's
stomping ground.

36:20.490 --> 36:22.243
Okay, it stands to reason
Astrid would go there

36:22.245 --> 36:24.474
looking for her father,
but why reach out to Mathers?

36:24.476 --> 36:26.491
Well, if she called him,
then Mathers probably realized

36:26.493 --> 36:28.292
he's been hunting
for the wrong person.

36:28.293 --> 36:29.770
If that's true,
once he finds Astrid,

36:29.772 --> 36:31.109
he's going to kill her.

36:48.270 --> 36:50.610
Astrid's too smart to let
Mathers find her like this.

36:50.612 --> 36:53.250
She couldn't get him at his lab,
so she led him here.

36:53.252 --> 36:55.559
If Astrid still has the gun,
I think she might use it.

36:55.584 --> 36:56.930
To protect herself?

36:56.931 --> 36:58.350
To protect her dad.

36:58.352 --> 36:59.653
We got eyes on Mathers.

36:59.655 --> 37:01.224
He's on the west side
of the floor.

37:01.226 --> 37:02.979
Looks like he's headed
towards the kitchen.

37:04.368 --> 37:06.123
Moving in.

37:14.683 --> 37:15.734
Mathers!

37:15.736 --> 37:18.576
He's got a weapon!

37:24.912 --> 37:27.603
Mathers,
drop your weapon.

37:27.605 --> 37:29.024
Drop it.

37:35.276 --> 37:37.783
You got this?

37:38.620 --> 37:40.592
Yeah, I got this.

37:46.310 --> 37:48.304
Astrid?

37:48.306 --> 37:50.964
I told you,
I don't have friends.

37:50.966 --> 37:53.643
Told you I wanted
to be the first.

37:53.645 --> 37:55.288
Prove it.

37:56.469 --> 37:58.748
That's kind of hard right
now, don't you think?

37:58.750 --> 38:00.460
Then you're not really my friend.
Okay.

38:00.462 --> 38:02.903
Astrid, tell me
what you want me to do.

38:02.905 --> 38:04.234
You tell me.

38:04.236 --> 38:07.060
Leave me alone
so I can shoot him.

38:07.062 --> 38:09.854
I know you're trying
to protect your dad, but...

38:09.856 --> 38:12.797
I can't do that. I'm sorry.

38:12.799 --> 38:16.256
This is not something that
you want to hear right now...

38:16.258 --> 38:19.282
but I will do everything
in my power to stop you.

38:19.284 --> 38:20.945
Do you hear me?

38:24.055 --> 38:27.762
This is what friendship
looks like, isn't it?

38:29.227 --> 38:32.701
Yeah. It is.

38:35.046 --> 38:37.866
Please hand me the gun.

38:42.100 --> 38:45.036
Please hand me the gun.

38:54.048 --> 38:56.950
You really like
<i>Pretty in Pink</i> and Oreos,

38:56.952 --> 38:59.357
or were you just saying that?

38:59.359 --> 39:01.414
I do like them.

39:01.416 --> 39:03.173
It's weird.

39:04.037 --> 39:06.077
Okay.

39:06.079 --> 39:09.214
Hey, what do you say
we get out of here?

39:20.799 --> 39:22.655
What's up, man?
Hey.

39:26.474 --> 39:28.431
Anybody seen, uh, Hetty?

39:28.433 --> 39:30.173
Nope. Haven't
seen her.

39:30.175 --> 39:32.795
Writing off your losses in
Vegas as business expenses?

39:32.797 --> 39:35.202
What? No.
What do you take me for?

39:35.204 --> 39:37.475
A guy who
sneaks off to Vegas

39:37.477 --> 39:40.412
for <i>Phantom of the Opera</i>
and has a secret love

39:40.414 --> 39:42.835
for musical theater.

39:42.837 --> 39:45.391
We always know where
our teammates are, Deeks.

39:45.393 --> 39:46.416
Always.

39:46.418 --> 39:48.767
Phantom of the what?
Opera.

39:48.769 --> 39:50.944
I wouldn't know, see, 'cause
I'm not into musical theater.

39:51.044 --> 39:52.676
Nothing wrong
with a good musical, Deeks.

39:53.170 --> 39:54.596
Fair enough.
You got me.

39:54.598 --> 39:58.259
Just do me a favor...
Oh, we won't tell Kensi.

39:58.261 --> 40:00.443
How's Astrid?
The doctor

40:00.445 --> 40:01.820
diagnosed her with
Asperger's syndrome.

40:01.822 --> 40:04.374
Says she can look after herself
with a little bit of help.

40:04.376 --> 40:05.601
Well, Hoffman's
facing jail time,

40:05.603 --> 40:07.700
so the girl's
on her own for now.

40:07.702 --> 40:09.078
And she's a smart girl.

40:09.080 --> 40:10.977
I'm sure she'll figure it out.

40:10.979 --> 40:12.707
Oh, and just
for the record,

40:12.709 --> 40:14.640
I also went and saw
Andrew Dice Clay

40:14.642 --> 40:16.940
- just to even it out.
- Yeah, right.

40:17.781 --> 40:21.005
Okay, two, please.

40:36.093 --> 40:38.780
So, tell me about your mom.
She's dead.

40:39.654 --> 40:41.453
I know.

40:41.455 --> 40:43.785
What was she like, though?

40:50.114 --> 40:52.179
Okay.

40:52.181 --> 40:53.912
Let's start with me.

40:53.914 --> 40:56.027
You can ask me
anything you like.

40:56.029 --> 40:58.942
Are you in love
with your partner?

41:01.324 --> 41:03.273
How old are you?

41:03.275 --> 41:08.152
18 years, three months, 12 days,
six hours and 32 seconds.

41:08.154 --> 41:09.968
33.

41:09.970 --> 41:12.125
34...

41:14.150 --> 41:16.734
Your dad was happy to see you.

41:16.736 --> 41:18.362
Mike was happy,
but he was sad, too.

41:18.364 --> 41:20.798
He tried to hide it from me,
but I could tell.

41:20.800 --> 41:23.070
Why do you call him Mike
if he's your dad?

41:23.072 --> 41:24.781
That's his name.

41:25.769 --> 41:27.711
Are you sure he's your dad?

41:27.713 --> 41:29.357
Yes. My mom told me that.

41:29.359 --> 41:31.958
But how do you
know it's true?

41:33.359 --> 41:36.186
Are you sure that the man
that you call Dad

41:36.188 --> 41:37.800
is your real dad, Kensi?

41:37.802 --> 41:39.610
Yeah.

41:39.612 --> 41:43.293
How do you know
that it's true?

41:45.955 --> 41:48.147
Point taken.

41:48.984 --> 41:51.746
Win the next hand...

41:51.748 --> 41:55.126
and I will answer
any question that you ask me.

41:55.128 --> 41:57.637
I'm not going to win
the next hand.

41:57.639 --> 42:00.901
Or any hand after that,
for that matter.

42:02.359 --> 42:05.638
I do really want to know
more about you, though,

42:05.640 --> 42:07.478
Astrid.

42:09.438 --> 42:13.454
I guess you'll have
to keep me around, then.

42:26.645 --> 42:29.488
My name's Hetty Lange.

42:40.520 --> 42:44.532
== sync, corrected by elderman ==

42:46.044 --> 42:48.721
<i>You feeling lucky?</i>
