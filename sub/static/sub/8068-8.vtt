[music playing]

00:59.393 --> 01:01.395
Babe, are my sideburns even?

01:01.495 --> 01:03.431
You don't have any sideburns.

01:03.531 --> 01:05.933
Remember when I had them
down to here with my hair

01:06.033 --> 01:06.867
down to my shoulders?

01:06.967 --> 01:08.269
Boink.

01:08.369 --> 01:10.138
Yeah, and when you used
to ride your motorcycle,

01:10.238 --> 01:12.673
you had to borrow my barrettes.

01:12.773 --> 01:13.574
Yeah.

01:13.674 --> 01:16.544
I was a stud, wasn't I?

01:16.644 --> 01:17.445
Yeah.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.847
What happened?

01:19.947 --> 01:21.182
Some woman married me.

01:26.154 --> 01:28.389
Thanks, warden.

01:28.489 --> 01:29.723
Did they call off school yet?

01:29.823 --> 01:30.791
Not yet.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.160
Oh, please let
school be closed.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.161
Please.

01:33.261 --> 01:33.594
I don't want to do
this book report.

01:33.694 --> 01:34.295
Whoo.

01:34.395 --> 01:35.296
Do you believe this?

01:35.396 --> 01:36.397
What?

01:36.497 --> 01:38.299
38 inches of snow in
Fargo, North Dakota.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.701
Oh, those poor Fargoites.

01:40.801 --> 01:43.637
REPORTER (ON RADIO): We have the
last of the school closings in.

01:43.737 --> 01:45.473
Rights High School,
Lamar High School,

01:45.573 --> 01:47.941
and Third Street Elementary
will be closed today.

01:48.041 --> 01:50.711
All schools in the Aurora and
Lanford districts will be open.

01:50.811 --> 01:51.712
Oh, no.

01:51.812 --> 01:54.148
Yaaayyyy!

01:54.248 --> 01:55.149
[laughs]

01:55.249 --> 01:56.049
DARLENE: Mom--

01:56.150 --> 01:59.086
[music playing]

02:02.122 --> 02:04.124
ROSEANNE: You know, she
hasn't read the book.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.659
It's freezing in here.

02:05.759 --> 02:06.760
Ohh.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.729
Pour some of that over
my feet, would you?

02:08.829 --> 02:10.798
It was 12 degrees when I
left the house this morning.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.032
Tell me about it.

02:12.132 --> 02:16.204
I kissed Dan goodbye and
my tongue got stuck to him.

02:16.304 --> 02:20.208
I almost had to bring
him to work with me.

02:20.308 --> 02:22.075
Crystal, you all right?

02:22.176 --> 02:23.344
Huh?

02:23.444 --> 02:25.045
Something bothering you?

02:25.145 --> 02:26.880
She's been weird all day.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.782
I'm fine.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.951
Hey, Pete, any heat
coming out of there at all?

02:31.051 --> 02:31.952
Nada.

02:32.052 --> 02:33.020
JACKIE: You going
to fix that heat?

02:33.120 --> 02:34.888
Or do we build a bonfire?

02:34.988 --> 02:36.324
You want heat?

02:36.424 --> 02:37.758
I'll give you all
you can handle.

02:37.858 --> 02:40.093
[sighs]

02:42.029 --> 02:45.433
I'd rather freeze to death.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.868
You know, Jackie, I think
you've got a hormonal problem.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.102
No way, Pete.

02:49.203 --> 02:53.307
It's just, when you're
around, our hormones mutate.

02:53.407 --> 02:55.409
- Pete, you check the fuse box?
- Uh, yeah.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.744
I was just going to do that.
JACKIE: Hey, Booker.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.178
Hey.
Hey.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.079
Booker.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.415
We still on for tonight?

03:01.515 --> 03:02.483
On for what?

03:02.583 --> 03:03.784
I told you I was
going to try and get

03:03.884 --> 03:06.153
tickets to the auto show.

03:06.254 --> 03:08.155
Yeah, but there
was nothing definite.

03:08.256 --> 03:09.690
There is now.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.091
[laughs]

03:11.191 --> 03:12.693
Well, you know--

03:12.793 --> 03:14.528
Jackie, I'd love to go.

03:14.628 --> 03:15.829
But.

03:15.929 --> 03:19.032
- But my mom's in town.
- Ohh.

03:19.132 --> 03:20.234
Yeah.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.502
And uh, you know, she's--
for a couple of days.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.771
Yeah.
Well, if you've got other plans.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.205
You know my mom's
really in town.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.139
No.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.708
You don't owe me
any explanations.

03:27.808 --> 03:30.578
That's just 20 bucks
for the tickets.

03:30.678 --> 03:31.479
BOOKER: What?

03:31.579 --> 03:33.080
No, I'm kidding.

03:33.180 --> 03:34.548
Here, take your mom
to the auto show.

03:34.648 --> 03:35.449
It's on me.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.850
[sighs]

03:43.056 --> 03:44.958
Well, you're feeling
pretty generous there, sis.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.093
JACKIE: What?
No.

03:46.193 --> 03:48.028
I got the tickets for free.

03:48.128 --> 03:51.332
Just trying to
make him feel bad.

03:51.432 --> 03:52.966
Roseanne, you got
something for a headache?

03:53.066 --> 03:53.867
ROSEANNE: Yeah.

03:53.967 --> 03:54.768
Three screaming kids.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.740
What do you want, doll?

03:59.840 --> 04:01.008
An Aspirin.

04:01.108 --> 04:05.012
Well, you want
tablets, or caplets,

04:05.112 --> 04:06.780
or would you like
an effervescent?

04:06.880 --> 04:08.916
Anything.

04:09.016 --> 04:09.917
SYLVIA: There you go.

04:10.017 --> 04:10.818
Thanks.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.093
What is wrong?

04:20.193 --> 04:21.962
- Oh, nothing.
- Are you sure?

04:22.062 --> 04:22.996
I'm sure.

04:23.096 --> 04:23.997
ROSEANNE: OK.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.299
2, 3, 4.

04:25.399 --> 04:27.401
Hank ruined my life.

04:27.501 --> 04:28.902
Let me guess.

04:29.002 --> 04:31.939
He dumped you?

04:32.039 --> 04:33.707
For somebody else.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.843
And you didn't see it coming?

04:35.943 --> 04:38.178
I'm so stupid.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.514
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

04:40.614 --> 04:43.817
Oh, Crystal, don't be stupid.

04:43.917 --> 04:44.752
I'm sorry.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.186
It's just my whole
world collapsed.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.588
JACKIE: Well, there's
only one thing to do.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.990
We'll all go out to the
Lobo Lounge after work,

04:50.090 --> 04:51.291
we'll talk this thing over.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.093
Oh.
No.

04:53.193 --> 04:54.628
I'd have to get a
sitter to watch Lonnie.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.063
Well, Crystal,
then get a sitter.

04:56.163 --> 04:56.997
No, no.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.432
You two don't have
to take me out.

04:58.532 --> 04:59.967
That's too much bother.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.669
Crystal, you got
to go out with us

05:01.769 --> 05:03.170
and talk this thing over.

05:03.270 --> 05:06.707
Otherwise, you know you'll get
home, and you'll get all upset,

05:06.807 --> 05:08.876
and then you'll put on
your Patsy Cline records,

05:08.976 --> 05:10.277
and you'll sit on
the kitchen floor,

05:10.378 --> 05:11.812
and then you'll cry,
and cry, and cry.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.748
Then you'll call me 80 million
times and drive me nuts.

05:17.885 --> 05:18.686
I won't call you.

05:18.786 --> 05:20.087
I--I promise.

05:20.187 --> 05:22.289
I'm an adult and I'm
got to learn to work

05:22.390 --> 05:25.025
these things out for myself.

05:25.125 --> 05:28.396
[music playing]

05:32.833 --> 05:36.103
Darlene, pick up
these paper wads, now.

05:36.203 --> 05:38.038
But I got to do my report.

05:38.138 --> 05:39.206
I thought that was due today.

05:39.306 --> 05:40.408
Ah, Mrs. Crane was sick.

05:40.508 --> 05:41.675
It's not due until tomorrow.

05:41.775 --> 05:44.478
And the forecast is for snow!

05:44.578 --> 05:45.879
Did you read the book?

05:45.979 --> 05:47.615
Snow!

05:47.715 --> 05:48.882
Read the book.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.385
[phone rings]

05:51.485 --> 05:52.620
I'll get it.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.321
[phone rings]

05:54.422 --> 05:56.857
Hello?
Oh, yeah.

05:56.957 --> 05:57.958
Hi, Crystal.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.460
What's wrong?
Yeah, she's here.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.360
Hold on.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.029
Roseanne, it's Crystal.

06:02.129 --> 06:02.996
She don't sound so good.

06:03.096 --> 06:03.931
Thanks.

06:04.031 --> 06:07.067
Probably has to
do a book report.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.036
Hi, Crystal.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.370
No, it's all right.

06:10.471 --> 06:11.472
No.

06:11.572 --> 06:12.372
No.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.642
Stop crying.

06:14.742 --> 06:15.776
Turn that record player down.

06:18.512 --> 06:19.580
No.
No.

06:19.680 --> 06:20.781
That's OK.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.583
No, me and Jackie, we're
going to come and get you

06:22.683 --> 06:25.185
and we're going to go
out and talk about it.

06:25.285 --> 06:26.086
No.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.922
You're not stupid.

06:29.022 --> 06:29.823
No.

06:29.923 --> 06:30.958
OK.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.125
All right.
OK.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.026
Bye.

06:37.965 --> 06:38.832
ROSEANNE: Don't pick them up.

06:38.932 --> 06:41.401
Darlene's supposed to do it.

06:41.502 --> 06:44.237
Wee.

06:44.337 --> 06:45.706
What's going on?

06:45.806 --> 06:47.875
Oh, Crystal's
flipping out again.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.242
Guy problems?

06:49.342 --> 06:50.143
No.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.614
She couldn't get
into law school.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.082
She got dumped, huh?

06:55.182 --> 06:56.216
Listen.

06:56.316 --> 06:58.018
Me and Jackie are going
to go get her, you know,

06:58.118 --> 07:00.353
and then we're going to
go over to the Lobo Lounge

07:00.454 --> 07:02.289
and help her out with
her love life here.

07:02.389 --> 07:03.624
So you going to
desert me and leave me

07:03.724 --> 07:05.258
here with a house full of kids?

07:05.358 --> 07:06.326
Yep.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.528
OK.

07:07.628 --> 07:08.662
Listen.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.464
This is going to be out
of here in 15 minutes.

07:10.564 --> 07:13.701
And Darlene, when I come home
I want to see a finished book

07:13.801 --> 07:15.302
report on this table.

07:15.402 --> 07:16.704
DARLENE: I know, mom.

07:16.804 --> 07:17.671
I know.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.372
What are you going
to tell Crystal?

07:19.473 --> 07:20.741
What I always tell her.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.543
To give up on romance
and get married.

07:26.279 --> 07:29.517
Worked for us.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.451
[kiss sound]

07:31.552 --> 07:34.855
[music playing]

07:41.128 --> 07:42.395
OK.

07:42.496 --> 07:44.064
I'm going to have one drink
and then I'm going to go home.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.799
SPORTS ANNOUNCER (ON TV):
Swing pass to the tailback

07:45.899 --> 07:47.467
and he's caught behind
the line of scrimmage.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.903
[cheering]

07:50.003 --> 07:50.904
Savannah.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.573
Hey, Rosie.
How you doing?

07:52.673 --> 07:53.541
I'm great.

07:53.641 --> 07:54.875
Where's your old man?

07:54.975 --> 07:56.510
Oh, I left him
home with the kids.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.478
You mean you got
him to babysit?

07:58.579 --> 07:59.379
Babysit, hell.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.549
They're his kids, too.

08:01.649 --> 08:02.950
Well, what can I do for you?

08:03.050 --> 08:05.018
Give us a couple of beers.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.654
What are you drinking, Crystal?

08:06.754 --> 08:07.988
Oh, anything.

08:08.088 --> 08:11.925
Get her a glass of pine tar.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.862
I'll have a pink squirrel.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.363
So what's with her?

08:16.463 --> 08:17.665
She lose another man?

08:17.765 --> 08:19.199
That's why we're here.

08:19.299 --> 08:22.870
Well, you tell her that
pink squirrel is on the house.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.773
Oh, Crystal, you're just
so cute when you're morbid,

08:25.873 --> 08:29.276
depressed, and self-destructive.

08:29.376 --> 08:30.811
I can't help it.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.846
When I met Hank I
thought the dating gods

08:32.946 --> 08:34.247
had finally smiled on me.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.849
JACKIE: Oh, forget that jerk.

08:35.949 --> 08:38.318
You'll probably meet
another one within a week.

08:38.418 --> 08:39.286
You want me to run a tab?

08:39.386 --> 08:40.187
Definitely.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.655
Crystal's paying.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.323
- I didn't bring that much cash.
- OK.

08:43.423 --> 08:44.391
Jackie's paying.

08:44.491 --> 08:47.628
SAVANNAH: Here you
go, doll On the house,

08:47.728 --> 08:50.163
I need two drafts
and a vodka tonic.

08:50.263 --> 08:51.298
OK.

08:51.398 --> 08:52.800
Here's an empty table,
might as well grab it.

08:52.900 --> 08:53.701
Oh thanks, Claire.

08:58.238 --> 09:01.341
You know, Hank used to
buy me pink squirrels.

09:01.441 --> 09:03.443
ROSEANNE: All right,
Crystal, spit it out.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.079
What happened with this creep?

09:06.179 --> 09:08.916
Last night he came to
pick me up to go bowling

09:09.016 --> 09:12.185
and the minute he said, hello,
I could see goodbye in his eyes.

09:12.285 --> 09:13.453
What exactly did he say?

09:13.553 --> 09:15.589
Oh, same thing
they always say.

09:15.689 --> 09:19.092
"Crystal, you're the most
wonderful woman I've ever known

09:19.192 --> 09:22.329
but I've fallen in love
with someone else."

09:22.429 --> 09:23.496
I trusted Hank.

09:23.597 --> 09:24.832
Boy, not me.

09:24.932 --> 09:28.368
Them buffed fingernails
kept me up at night.

09:28.468 --> 09:30.103
Why does this
always happen to me?

09:30.203 --> 09:32.305
When I meet a man I give,
and give, and give some

09:32.405 --> 09:35.475
more and then he takes, and
takes, and takes some more,

09:35.575 --> 09:36.777
and then he dumps me.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.346
Well, there's a definite
pattern here, Crystal.

09:39.446 --> 09:40.580
But I'm a nice person.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.315
Why does this
always happen to me?

09:42.415 --> 09:44.051
Well, I don't know how
to tell you this, honey,

09:44.151 --> 09:47.454
but, well, you're a doormat.

09:47.554 --> 09:48.588
CRYSTAL: I am not.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.791
Crystal, how many times
have you been married?

09:50.891 --> 09:52.292
I don't see what that
has do with anything.

09:52.392 --> 09:53.426
ROSEANNE: No, no, no.
How many times?

09:53.526 --> 09:54.628
Three.

09:54.728 --> 09:57.064
And how many times have
you had your heart broken?

09:57.164 --> 09:58.598
More times than I can count.

09:58.699 --> 10:01.368
Well, why do
you think that is?

10:01.468 --> 10:04.304
Because I'm a doormat.

10:04.404 --> 10:05.839
You see what it
all comes down to?

10:05.939 --> 10:07.307
It your self-esteem.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.542
Oh, I never had any of that.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.745
JACKIE: You're a
classic case, Crystal.

10:11.845 --> 10:14.347
This is a lifelong pattern
that will just repeat itself

10:14.447 --> 10:16.984
over, and over, and over again.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.051
You are right.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.386
You are absolutely right.

10:19.486 --> 10:21.488
When a man pays me a
compliment, next thing

10:21.588 --> 10:23.857
you know I'm married and
then, before I can blink,

10:23.957 --> 10:24.992
I'm divorced.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.727
And that is the pattern
that you have to break.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.896
You can't get sucked into
all those compliments.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.798
Well, I can't help it.

10:30.898 --> 10:31.765
Yes you can, Crystal.

10:31.865 --> 10:34.868
You just need some practice.
Listen.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.336
Let's pretend that I'm a guy.

10:36.436 --> 10:38.205
- Oh, Roseanne, that's silly.
- No.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.073
I'm going to be one of these
studs over here at the bar,

10:40.173 --> 10:42.575
you know, and then I'm
going to come over to you

10:42.676 --> 10:44.812
and start coming on
to you, see, and then

10:44.912 --> 10:46.279
you tell me to get lost.

10:46.379 --> 10:47.647
OK.
I'll try.

10:47.748 --> 10:48.949
OK.
I'm going to be the man.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.221
[laughs]

10:59.827 --> 11:00.627
Pfft.

11:00.728 --> 11:01.628
[laughs]

11:04.698 --> 11:07.434
Pfft.

11:07.534 --> 11:11.204
Hey there, little missy.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.874
You wouldn't know how to fix
a broken zipper in an old pair

11:13.974 --> 11:15.709
of blue jeans now, would you?

11:15.809 --> 11:18.979
[laughs] You're pathetic.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.014
[laughter]

11:21.114 --> 11:22.015
Oh.

11:22.115 --> 11:23.984
You're about as
pretty as a young deer

11:24.084 --> 11:26.319
running through a green
field in the autumn.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.121
[laughs]

11:30.690 --> 11:33.693
And now you tell
him to get lost.

11:33.794 --> 11:34.962
Please, get lost.

11:35.062 --> 11:37.064
ROSEANNE: Oh, for crying
out loud, Crystal.

11:37.164 --> 11:37.965
I'll do it.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.299
OK.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.034
You be the guy and you do it
to me and I'll-- now watch.

11:41.134 --> 11:41.935
All right.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.337
Sit down.

11:44.437 --> 11:45.405
OK.

11:45.505 --> 11:46.306
Here he comes.

11:49.142 --> 11:52.045
Uh, hello there you
sweet, young thin--

11:52.145 --> 11:53.646
Oh, my.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.482
Hello.

11:55.582 --> 11:56.383
ROSEANNE: Hey.

11:56.483 --> 11:57.550
Take a hike, pal.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.319
Crawl back under your rock.

11:59.419 --> 12:00.854
Get away from me, you
weasel-faced geek.

12:00.954 --> 12:01.755
See?

12:01.855 --> 12:04.858
It's easy.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.493
You either learn
how to do that

12:06.593 --> 12:08.528
or you swear off men forever.

12:08.628 --> 12:09.562
MAN: Excuse me.

12:09.662 --> 12:10.931
Is this chair taken?

12:11.031 --> 12:12.065
Yes, that chair's taken.

12:12.165 --> 12:12.966
Quit bothering us.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.302
Go on a hike.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.237
Aw, she forgot to
take her medication.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.940
Sorry.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.141
Go ahead and take the chair.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.042
MAN: Thanks.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.045
Get a grip.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.547
[laughs] Lighten up, Crystal.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.082
He only wanted a chair.

12:29.182 --> 12:32.219
Well, first they want your
chair, then they want your bed.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.620
They're all alike,
rotten to the core.

12:33.720 --> 12:34.721
JACKIE: Oh, Crystal.

12:34.822 --> 12:37.858
There are a few decent
men left out there.

12:37.958 --> 12:38.926
You mean like Booker?

12:39.026 --> 12:40.327
Mm-hmm.

12:40.427 --> 12:43.363
Booker happens to have
a lot of potential.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.032
Well, why don't
you go tell him that?

12:45.132 --> 12:47.267
There he is.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.370
Oh, who's he with?

12:50.470 --> 12:53.040
His mother.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.042
SPORTS ANNOUNCER (ON TV): The
pass goes long down field.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.109
Quick is under and he's got it.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.010
Touchdown!

12:57.110 --> 12:58.311
All right!

12:58.411 --> 12:59.512
Another six points.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.914
Blowout city!

13:01.014 --> 13:02.349
I hate Betsy Ross.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.351
I wish she'd have sewn
her fingers together.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.153
Darlene, get back in there
and finish that report.

13:06.253 --> 13:07.787
Dad, you said you'd help me.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.857
Darlene, I'm not going
to read the book for you.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.024
I read the stupid book.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.359
Then write the stupid report.

13:12.459 --> 13:17.330
Dad, she was born, she
sewed a flag, and she died.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.699
I can't write five
pages about that.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.101
Please.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.803
Those of us who did our homework
are trying to watch the game.

13:23.904 --> 13:24.838
Oh, shove it.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.339
Hey.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.075
She didn't finish the dishes.

13:28.175 --> 13:29.142
You didn't?

13:29.242 --> 13:30.677
I'm letting them soak.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.645
Please let me watch the
game Oh, please, please let me

13:32.745 --> 13:33.513
watch the game.

13:33.613 --> 13:34.481
All right, all
right all right.

13:34.581 --> 13:35.883
10 more minutes
and then that's it.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.350
Oh, yes.
[phone ringing]

13:37.450 --> 13:38.151
SPORTS ANNOUNCER
(ON TV): Quarterback

13:38.251 --> 13:38.852
looking over the secondary.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.153
Now he's audiblizing.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.254
I'll get it.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.722
SPORTS ANNOUNCER (ON
TV): There's the blitz.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.291
He beats the rush, throws.
- Hello?

13:44.391 --> 13:45.658
Hey, Rosie.
How's Crystal?

13:45.758 --> 13:46.626
Oh!

13:46.726 --> 13:47.560
Ohh!

13:47.660 --> 13:48.528
Oh!

13:48.628 --> 13:49.462
Nothing, honey.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.531
Dad, did you see that play?

13:51.631 --> 13:53.333
Yeah.
Yeah, I know honey.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.102
It's way past DJ's
bedtime but, honey,

13:55.202 --> 13:57.304
it's important for a young
boy to watch football.

13:57.404 --> 13:58.271
Pass the ball!

13:58.371 --> 13:59.272
What a play!

13:59.372 --> 14:00.473
[cheering]

14:00.573 --> 14:01.374
No, honey.

14:01.474 --> 14:02.275
Don't worry about a thing.

14:02.375 --> 14:03.676
The dishes are fine.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.745
Yeah, Darlene's in their
pounding out that book report.

14:05.845 --> 14:06.980
[snapping]

14:07.080 --> 14:08.215
Yeah, no.
OK.

14:08.315 --> 14:09.149
No.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.383
Don't worry about
us, we're fine.

14:10.483 --> 14:13.353
Stay out as long as you want.

14:13.453 --> 14:14.254
OK.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.288
That's it, that's it.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.589
Becky get in there
and do those dishes.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.691
- Dad, you said 10 more minutes.
- I lied.

14:18.791 --> 14:21.028
Darlene, get in there
and finish that report.

14:21.128 --> 14:23.130
DJ, upstairs now.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.597
But, Dad, you
promised you'd help me.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.698
You're right.
OK.

14:25.798 --> 14:26.666
I did.
All right.

14:26.766 --> 14:27.734
No more football for anyone.

14:27.834 --> 14:28.635
TV's going off.

14:28.735 --> 14:30.437
That's-- that's it.
I mean it.

14:30.537 --> 14:31.371
Oh, oh!

14:31.471 --> 14:32.739
Oh.

14:32.839 --> 14:34.908
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,
baby baby, baby, baby, baby.

14:35.008 --> 14:35.875
Ohhh!

14:35.976 --> 14:36.843
Touchdown!

14:36.944 --> 14:37.744
Yeah!

14:37.844 --> 14:39.246
[all cheering]

14:40.380 --> 14:41.181
Phew.

14:43.616 --> 14:44.417
All right.

14:44.517 --> 14:45.885
10 more minutes and that's it.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.895
I don't believe that guy.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.030
His mother.

14:57.130 --> 14:57.965
What did I tell you?

14:58.065 --> 14:59.099
It just proves my point.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.333
They're all rotten.

15:00.433 --> 15:01.568
Roseanne, give me
your wedding ring.

15:01.668 --> 15:02.970
- For what?
- Just let me use it.

15:03.070 --> 15:06.206
What are you going to do?

15:06.306 --> 15:07.774
You know, Booker,
times like this I'm

15:07.874 --> 15:10.043
sorry I got a roommate.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.980
Well, you know, it just so
happens that I live alone.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.281
Think I should
call my roommate,

15:14.381 --> 15:16.249
tell her not to wait up?

15:16.349 --> 15:18.851
That might be a good idea.

15:18.952 --> 15:19.752
Hi.

15:19.852 --> 15:21.688
[chokes] Hi.

15:21.788 --> 15:24.958
Um, Jackie.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.093
Janine, this is Jackie.

15:26.193 --> 15:27.360
Jackie, this is Janine.
- Hi.

15:27.460 --> 15:28.495
Glad to meet you.

15:28.595 --> 15:29.596
Booker, where have you been?

15:29.696 --> 15:31.164
I've been looking for
you for three days.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.099
BOOKER: Jackie.

15:32.199 --> 15:35.302
Honey, are you
ever coming home?

15:35.402 --> 15:37.104
Booker, what's going on?

15:37.204 --> 15:38.471
I'm sorry to interrupt.

15:38.571 --> 15:41.274
It's just that the kids have
been asking about their daddy.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.175
The kids?

15:42.275 --> 15:43.276
Jackie, cut it out.

15:43.376 --> 15:45.345
- Is this your wife?
- No.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.346
You're divorced?

15:46.446 --> 15:48.548
Is that what he's
been telling you?

15:48.648 --> 15:50.050
This is not my wife.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.784
Sweetheart, what
are you saying?

15:51.884 --> 15:52.752
There is no wife.

15:52.852 --> 15:54.854
Honey, don't do that to me.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.157
There's no wife, there's
no kids, it's all a joke.

15:57.257 --> 16:00.427
No, you're the joke.

16:00.527 --> 16:01.794
Janine, come on.

16:01.894 --> 16:03.663
Wait.

16:03.763 --> 16:04.998
What was that?

16:05.098 --> 16:07.567
You would pass up the auto
show to take out that tramp?

16:07.667 --> 16:08.968
She is just a friend.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.970
Of your mother's?

16:11.071 --> 16:11.871
Give me a break.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.840
- You lied to me.
- I'm sorry.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.175
I didn't think it was
going to hurt you.

16:15.275 --> 16:19.746
I didn't say that it hurt
me, I said that you lied to me.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.314
Well, you know, the
way you treat me at work,

16:21.414 --> 16:22.715
I didn't think it mattered
one way or another.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.084
Oh, don't give me that.

16:24.184 --> 16:25.485
You know damn well the way we
treat each other has nothing

16:25.585 --> 16:28.021
to do with the way we feel.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.122
Well, how do we feel?

16:29.222 --> 16:30.157
I don't know.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.362
Why don't you buy me
a beer and we'll talk.

16:42.535 --> 16:45.538
I'd give anything to have
a man as wonderful as Dan.

16:45.638 --> 16:46.439
Yeah.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.341
He's all right.

16:48.441 --> 16:51.211
What was the one thing that
made you want to marry him?

16:51.311 --> 16:53.613
His sense of humor.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.915
That and the way his
jeans kept falling

16:56.015 --> 16:57.317
off the back of his butt.

17:01.188 --> 17:02.989
You're lucky you
grabbed him in high school

17:03.090 --> 17:04.891
when the pickings were lush.

17:04.991 --> 17:07.427
Yeah, I snapped him right up.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.696
I'd give anything to
be back in high school.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.064
God, why?

17:11.164 --> 17:13.400
Life was so good.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.569
You had hayrides, and
pep rallies, slow dancing

17:16.669 --> 17:17.537
with Tommy Martin.

17:21.441 --> 17:24.777
I just thought my life was
going to turn out so different.

17:24.877 --> 17:29.382
Well, Crystal, let's face
some hard, cold facts now.

17:29.482 --> 17:32.419
Pep rallies and hayrides stink.

17:32.519 --> 17:35.488
And, uh, Tommy Martin's probably
living under some bridge

17:35.588 --> 17:38.491
by now, drinking wine
out of a paper sack.

17:38.591 --> 17:39.392
No.

17:39.492 --> 17:40.893
He's a CPA in Detroit.

17:40.993 --> 17:41.794
Same thing.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.100
Crystal, you don't want
to go back to high school.

17:47.200 --> 17:50.803
And, you know, man or no
man, you're a good person.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.139
I don't feel like one.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.906
Well, you are a
good person, Crystal.

17:54.006 --> 17:56.943
You're a great mother to
Lonnie and you are always

17:57.043 --> 17:59.446
the first person that
comes running every time

17:59.546 --> 18:01.848
anybody needs anything.

18:01.948 --> 18:05.218
And, you know, you're
honest, you're hard working.

18:05.318 --> 18:09.922
Let's face it, Crystal, you
are a vital, intelligent woman

18:10.022 --> 18:11.090
in the prime of your life.

18:13.993 --> 18:14.927
You buy any of that crap?

18:19.832 --> 18:20.933
Some of it.

18:21.033 --> 18:21.901
Well, that's enough.

18:22.001 --> 18:22.969
SPORTS ANNOUNCER
(ON TV): Wide left,

18:23.069 --> 18:24.271
decides to pull back
and go to the right.

18:24.371 --> 18:25.172
Quick pass over the middle.

18:25.272 --> 18:26.072
He's got it.

18:26.173 --> 18:26.973
He scores.

18:27.073 --> 18:29.909
[cheering]

18:31.944 --> 18:34.914
What do you
think you're doing?

18:35.014 --> 18:35.882
Aw, come on.

18:35.982 --> 18:37.016
You're not still
mad at me, are you?

18:37.116 --> 18:38.485
I might be.

18:38.585 --> 18:39.452
Jackie, please.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.221
Please what?

18:41.321 --> 18:42.489
You got to forgive me.

18:42.589 --> 18:45.158
I'll think about it.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.058
All right.

18:46.159 --> 18:48.495
This is just an idea, OK.

18:48.595 --> 18:53.200
But why don't you come back
to my place and forgive me.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.535
Aw.

18:55.635 --> 18:58.838
Well, why don't you
go back to your place

18:58.938 --> 19:00.273
and forgive yourself?

19:05.578 --> 19:07.980
- How we doing here?
- Oh, another round, Claire.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.183
Oh, and one of them
gooey, cheese pizzas.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.218
A large.

19:11.318 --> 19:12.118
Yeah.

19:12.219 --> 19:14.053
Coming right up.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.622
Thank you.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.590
Well, I see Booker's
date just kind

19:17.690 --> 19:18.725
of hightailed it out of here.

19:18.825 --> 19:19.626
I guess so.

19:19.726 --> 19:22.195
I hope it wasn't
anything I said.

19:22.295 --> 19:23.730
Oh, I'm sure it wasn't.

19:23.830 --> 19:24.797
Can you believe that guy?

19:24.897 --> 19:26.466
I chase off his date,
he asked me to go

19:26.566 --> 19:28.568
back to his apartment with him.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.503
Jackie, don't
let it get you down

19:30.603 --> 19:33.973
because you are an
intelligent, vital woman

19:34.073 --> 19:36.976
in the prime of her life.

19:37.076 --> 19:37.877
What?

19:37.977 --> 19:39.479
Tell her, Roseanne.

19:39.579 --> 19:40.380
Crystal's drunk.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.148
No, I'm not.

19:42.249 --> 19:43.816
Jackie, let's face it.

19:43.916 --> 19:47.354
We are all good women and any
man would be lucky to have us.

19:47.454 --> 19:48.988
And for the right
price, they could.

19:49.088 --> 19:52.259
CRYSTAL: Oh, no, no, no.
You wait and see.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.826
One of these days
the perfect man

19:53.926 --> 19:56.863
will come along who is
handsome, intelligent,

19:56.963 --> 19:59.999
and has great character.

20:00.099 --> 20:01.968
Oh, look at the
character on that guy.

20:02.068 --> 20:05.438
[music playing]

20:10.009 --> 20:15.748
National heroine, admired,
respected, and then she died.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.984
The end.

20:18.084 --> 20:19.319
So, what did you think?

20:19.419 --> 20:21.020
Pretty good.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.789
Yeah, and it's
five whole pages.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.424
Should be, you
wrote big enough.

20:24.524 --> 20:27.327
Oh, Crane won't
know the difference.

20:27.427 --> 20:28.428
You're right.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.497
Teachers aren't on to
that kind of stuff.

20:30.597 --> 20:31.431
Oh, hi.

20:31.531 --> 20:32.899
Hi, babe.

20:32.999 --> 20:33.800
Woo.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.535
What are you doing up?

20:35.635 --> 20:36.936
I just finished
my book report.

20:37.036 --> 20:38.204
How'd it go with Crystal?

20:38.305 --> 20:39.306
Oh, it was great.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.441
We talked her out of
her depression and back

20:41.541 --> 20:44.210
into her rut.

20:44.311 --> 20:45.578
So how's that book report doing?

20:45.678 --> 20:46.713
Pretty good.

20:46.813 --> 20:47.647
Pretty good?

20:47.747 --> 20:49.416
This is great.

20:49.516 --> 20:51.351
I worked really
hard on this thing.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.185
Well, I'm so
proud of you, honey

20:53.286 --> 20:56.088
and I have really great
news for you, too.

20:56.188 --> 20:57.757
It's snowing really,
really hard out there

20:57.857 --> 21:01.661
and there's no way there's
going to be any school tomorrow.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.763
Nooo!

21:03.863 --> 21:07.133
