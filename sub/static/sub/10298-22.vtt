15:05.767 --> 15:07.467
You seem
awfully nervous.

Don't be silly.
I'm fine.

Listen, Peggy,

15:15.734 --> 15:17.367
I've got to ask you
something.

15:17.367 --> 15:19.167
Have you ever done anything

15:19.167 --> 15:21.601
that you didn't remember
the next day?

15:21.601 --> 15:23.901
Well...

15:27.267 --> 15:28.767
I mean, have you
ever done anything

15:28.767 --> 15:31.400

I'm a shoe salesman.

16:58.701 --> 17:00.467
I'm gonna go take a shower.

17:00.467 --> 17:02.467

of the week?

something's wrong.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.567
you look good.

17:16.567 --> 17:19.334
I obviously agree with you.

17:19.334 --> 17:22.367
Look, let's clear the air.

17:22.367 --> 17:24.067
Nothing happened.

I am absolutely, positively sure

17:26.567 --> 17:28.367
nothing happened...

17:28.367 --> 17:30.801
but if it did,
even though it didn't,

17:30.801 --> 17:32.901
I don't want any rumors
getting around.

I know what you're
feeling for me, but, uh...

18:04.667 --> 18:06.767
I think it might be
healthier for the both of us

18:06.767 --> 18:10.100
to continue
seeing other people.

But sometimes

18:51.100 --> 18:52.601
the best way to hold

for talent,

21:06.868 --> 21:08.367
two points
for personality
