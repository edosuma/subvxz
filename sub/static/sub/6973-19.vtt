- [Groans]
- [Man] Give it up, Mulder!

00:14.948 --> 00:18.281
- You've got no chance!
- Damn it.

00:18.351 --> 00:20.615
My sniper zombies
are everywhere.

00:20.687 --> 00:23.315
[Grunting]

00:31.464 --> 00:33.398
I'll offer you a deal.

00:33.466 --> 00:37.630
You give me the Lazarus Bowl,
and I'll give you Scully.

00:37.704 --> 00:40.400
Mulder!

00:40.473 --> 00:42.964
How 'bout this deal?

00:43.043 --> 00:46.376
You give me Scully, I don't smash
the Lazarus Bowl and shove the pieces...

00:46.446 --> 00:51.145
where the Son of God don't shine,
you cigarette-smoking mackerel snapper.

00:59.759 --> 01:04.128
I break the Lazarus Bowl,
and all your sniper zombies...

01:04.197 --> 01:07.689
go back to being good
little well-behaved corpses.

01:07.767 --> 01:09.462
[Grunting]

01:09.536 --> 01:13.939
You don't fool me, Mulder.
That bowl is your Holy Grail.

01:14.007 --> 01:17.704
Encoded in its ancient ceramic grooves
are the words Jesus spake...

01:17.777 --> 01:20.371
when he raised Lazarus
from the dead.

01:20.447 --> 01:24.747
Still capable of raising
the dead 2,000 years later.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.378
Proof positive
of the paranormal.

01:27.454 --> 01:31.356
You can no sooner destroy that
than let the redhead die.

01:35.295 --> 01:38.355
Come on, man.
Don't break the bowl.

01:38.431 --> 01:40.365
We don't wanna go back
to being dead.

01:40.433 --> 01:45.871
There's no food, no women,
no dancing. Save the bowl,

01:45.939 --> 01:48.305
and we'll dump that
ciggy-smoking stooge for you.

01:48.374 --> 01:51.969
And you'll be the new king
of the dead.

01:55.248 --> 01:57.978
I'd rather serve in heaven
than rule in hell.

[Both Panting]

02:25.912 --> 02:30.872
Is that your flashlight, Mulder, or are
you just happy to be lying on top of me?

02:30.950 --> 02:33.885
- [Scattered Laughter]
- My flashlight.

- ## [Soft]

- Oh, that.

02:40.426 --> 02:42.917
[Laughter]

02:44.631 --> 02:48.499
For seven long years I've been waiting
for just the right moment, Scully.

02:48.568 --> 02:50.593
Oh, you're a sick man, Mulder.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.571
Go on.

02:53.640 --> 02:57.371
I love you, Scully.
No ifs, ands or...

02:57.443 --> 02:59.377
"Bs."

[Groans]

03:17.830 --> 03:19.798
[Kissing Continues]

04:11.683 --> 04:15.710
Yesterday a small pipe bomb
ripped through the crypt of
Christ's Church here in D.C.

04:15.787 --> 04:19.382
There were no casualties, no thefts,
no note making any demand.

04:19.457 --> 04:22.688
- Who's taking credit for it?
- Nobody.

04:22.761 --> 04:26.458
She: Jodie Foster's foster child
on a Payless budget.

04:26.531 --> 04:31.468
He's like a Jehovah's Witness
meets Harrison Ford's Witness.

04:35.140 --> 04:38.837
Uh, Christ's Church.
Isn't that Cardinal O'Fallon's church?

04:38.910 --> 04:41.504
Yes, O'Fallon's residence
is adjacent to the crypt.

04:41.580 --> 04:45.812
- Who's Cardinal O'Fallon?
- Cardinal "O'Fallen" perhaps.

04:48.787 --> 04:52.587
Um, he's one of the most powerful men
in the Church today.

04:52.657 --> 04:56.525
His name often comes up as a possibility
for the first American pope.

04:56.595 --> 04:59.496
- [Cell Phone Ringing]
- Oh.

04:59.564 --> 05:04.934
I don't wanna be myopic,
but this looks like a straight-up
terrorist act for the A.T.F.

05:05.003 --> 05:07.836
- "Myopic."
- [Cell Phone Ringing]

05:07.906 --> 05:09.897
Yes, it does.

05:09.975 --> 05:13.035
- [Ringing Continues]
- Are you gonna answer your phone?

05:13.111 --> 05:14.669
- Me?
- Yeah.

05:14.746 --> 05:17.510
I didn't wanna be rude.

05:17.582 --> 05:20.244
- Sir, who the hell is this guy?
- Hello.

05:20.318 --> 05:22.912
This is Wayne Federman. He's
an old buddy of mine from college.

05:22.988 --> 05:25.889
He's a writer out in Hollywood now and
he's working on a F.B.I. -based movie.

05:25.957 --> 05:29.449
- He's asked me to give him access.
- A screenwriter?

05:29.527 --> 05:32.223
It's actually writer/producer.

05:32.297 --> 05:34.697
That's actually just
a hindrance/pain in the neck.

05:34.766 --> 05:37.792
Yo, yo, yo. Agent Mulder,
I don't wanna eat your lunch.

05:37.869 --> 05:40.929
I'm just here for some
procedural flavor. Just a taste.

05:43.508 --> 05:45.976
I have no idea
what you just said.

05:46.044 --> 05:49.775
Well, the Skin man's filled
me in on your particular bent.

05:49.848 --> 05:54.148
He said that you come at things maybe a
little farkatke, a little Star Trekkie,

05:54.219 --> 05:57.552
which is the exact vibe I'm looking
for for this thing I'm doing.

05:57.622 --> 06:01.114
It's a Silence of the Lambs meets
Greatest Story Ever Told type thing.

06:01.192 --> 06:05.595
It's... beautiful and
I will not be in your way.

06:05.664 --> 06:08.462
I'll be strictly Heisenbergian.

06:08.533 --> 06:11.229
A hologram.

06:11.303 --> 06:14.329
Agent Mulder, Mr. Federman
will accompany you today
to Christ's Church...

06:14.406 --> 06:16.340
where he will act
as an observer on this case.

06:16.408 --> 06:20.674
You will extend to him
every courtesy and protection
you would a friend of the bureau's.

06:20.745 --> 06:24.146
Agent Scully, I require
your services here for the morning.

06:24.215 --> 06:26.877
[Laughs]

06:26.952 --> 06:29.614
Sir, have I pissed you off...

06:29.688 --> 06:32.088
in a way that's
more than normal?

06:32.157 --> 06:34.682
- Just curious if she's more
than your partner.
- Enough, Wayne.

06:34.759 --> 06:36.693
Hey, whatever.

06:36.761 --> 06:39.696
[Bells Chiming]

06:54.512 --> 06:58.539
Cardinal O'Fallon,
can you think of anyone who might
make an attempt on your life?

06:59.851 --> 07:03.446
The Church always has enemies,
Agent Mulder.

07:03.521 --> 07:07.617
The size of the bomb would
have limited its destruction
to just the crypt itself.

07:07.692 --> 07:11.560
- Is there anything down
there worth targeting?
- Not really.

07:11.629 --> 07:16.157
Just some old bones,
artifacts, relics,

07:16.234 --> 07:20.728
documents that we store
down there in the cold.

07:20.805 --> 07:23.330
I like to think of it
as God's refrigerator.

07:23.408 --> 07:25.933
- That's a great line.
- Thank you.

07:26.011 --> 07:28.241
- God's refrigerator.
- Wayne, shut up.

07:28.313 --> 07:31.373
[O'Fallon]
No treasures to the outside world.

07:31.449 --> 07:35.010
Things of negligible
monetary value,

07:35.086 --> 07:38.544
but great spiritual value
to the Church...

07:38.623 --> 07:40.887
ancient devotional texts,

07:42.293 --> 07:44.227
medieval relics.

07:44.295 --> 07:46.786
How 'bout the Shroud ofTurin?

07:46.865 --> 07:49.527
No, I'm afraid not.

07:49.601 --> 07:52.399
But we do have
the bathrobe of St. Peter.

07:52.470 --> 07:55.371
- You're kidding?
- Yes, I am.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.374
- That's a good line.
- Thank you.

07:57.442 --> 07:59.376
Wayne, shut up.

07:59.444 --> 08:02.572
Who comes down
to the crypt here?

08:02.647 --> 08:05.138
Only myself.

08:05.216 --> 08:08.242
A half a mile of catacombs here.

08:10.255 --> 08:12.985
I like to walk here
during lunch.

08:23.034 --> 08:25.764
That's where the bomb went off.

08:25.837 --> 08:28.397
Well, my instinct, Cardinal,

08:28.473 --> 08:32.273
is to see this desecration
of the dead less as a murder attempt...

08:32.342 --> 08:34.777
and more as a terrorist act.

08:34.846 --> 08:37.440
- [Cell Phone Ringing]
- A message...

08:41.453 --> 08:46.481
- Uh, this isn't me. I think it's you.
- [Ringing Continues]

08:46.558 --> 08:48.492
Excuse me.

08:50.295 --> 08:52.229
That's, uh...
That's not me.

08:52.297 --> 08:54.231
Let me check.

08:56.534 --> 08:58.468
Not me.

08:58.536 --> 09:00.936
We never get reception here.

09:01.005 --> 09:03.872
[Ringing Continues]

09:22.227 --> 09:24.161
[Ringing Continues]

09:24.229 --> 09:27.392
Would that be St. Jude's
cell phone, Cardinal?

09:30.668 --> 09:33.432
No.

09:33.505 --> 09:35.769
That's Micah Hoffman.

09:40.411 --> 09:42.345
[Ringing Stops]

09:48.085 --> 09:51.020
Micah Hoffman, Willie Mays
and Frank Serpico.

09:51.088 --> 09:53.716
That's my holy trinity, Scully.

09:53.791 --> 09:56.021
Of course I'm too young
to remember, but...

09:56.093 --> 10:00.325
wasn't he some kind of
a '60s campus radical like
a Jerry Rubin or a Mario Savio?

10:00.397 --> 10:04.766
Name a '60s counterculture
movement and Micah Hoffman
was at or near the center of it.

10:04.835 --> 10:08.066
He was one of the original Weathermen.
He was the first Yippie.

10:08.138 --> 10:10.072
He was a better poet
than Ginsberg.

10:10.140 --> 10:13.041
And he was also the starting shortstop
for his Columbia baseball team.

10:13.110 --> 10:16.773
- Then in the '70s,
didn't he go real low profile?
- Right after Altamont.

10:16.847 --> 10:20.613
- He was never heard from again.
- The Stones get blamed for everything.

10:20.684 --> 10:23.915
- I don't get it.
- This should be it here.

10:27.191 --> 10:29.386
What did Skinner want
you for this morning?

10:29.460 --> 10:31.985
Just paperwork.

10:32.062 --> 10:34.223
Mm-hmm.

10:42.172 --> 10:45.972
- Mulder, we should have a warrant.
- It's only the Constitution.

10:46.043 --> 10:49.012
No big deal.

10:49.079 --> 10:52.845
- Wow.
- "Dis-Feng-Shui."

10:52.916 --> 10:55.476
Mulder, sorry to denigrate
a third of your trinity,

10:55.552 --> 10:59.352
but it looks like Hoffman
was killed by one of his own bombs.

11:04.094 --> 11:07.586
Well, from Dharma Bum
to Dharma Bomb.

11:13.437 --> 11:15.962
[Mulder]
I knew Hoffman was a master potter.

11:16.040 --> 11:19.999
Well, it appears he was
a master calligrapher as well.

11:20.077 --> 11:23.774
Look, Mulder, we've got gum arabic
and sodium hydroxide here.

11:23.847 --> 11:26.338
Whew! These would
be used to, uh...

11:26.417 --> 11:29.011
to age the ink and the paper
prematurely.

11:29.086 --> 11:31.316
It's a forger's trick.

11:31.388 --> 11:34.357
Well, from counterculture
to counterfeiter.

11:34.425 --> 11:37.792
All right, one more pun
and I pull out my gun.

11:39.897 --> 11:42.422
Scully, look at that.
"Cristos."

11:42.499 --> 11:45.559
Looks like a religious text.
Can you read Greek at all?

11:45.636 --> 11:47.570
Well, it's pretty rusty.

11:47.638 --> 11:50.869
But it looks like
some kind of lost gospel.

11:50.941 --> 11:53.466
A gospel of Mary Magdalene.

11:53.544 --> 11:58.072
And "An Account of Christ's Life
on Earth After the Resurrection."

11:58.148 --> 12:00.480
- After?
- Yeah.

12:00.551 --> 12:02.576
It's a heretical text, Mulder.

12:02.653 --> 12:05.383
Mythical I should say,
but long rumored to be in existence.

12:05.456 --> 12:08.892
What would Micah Hoffman be doing
with heretical religious texts?

12:08.959 --> 12:11.587
I think the question is, what would
Hoffman be doing forging them?

12:11.662 --> 12:13.926
Ay-yi-yi. I think
the real question, Agents,

12:13.997 --> 12:19.367
is what might O'Fallon
be doing with Hoffman's forgeries?

12:19.436 --> 12:22.769
You don't need a Weatherman
to know which way the wind blows.

12:22.840 --> 12:25.365
Don't shoot!

12:28.479 --> 12:32.882
I like the way you guys work...
no warrants, no permission, no research.

12:32.950 --> 12:36.010
You're like studio executives
with guns.

12:36.086 --> 12:39.988
Should I call you Agent Mulder
or Mr. Mulder...

12:40.057 --> 12:43.026
- or do you have a nickname
or something like that?
- Shh, shh!

12:43.093 --> 12:44.958
[Rattling]

12:51.068 --> 12:53.628
Like Skin man?

12:53.704 --> 12:55.638
Just ignore me.

12:55.706 --> 12:57.640
What's that?

13:00.611 --> 13:04.172
Looks like the same Gospel of Mary
Scully I.D. 'd over at Hoffman's place.

13:04.248 --> 13:08.514
So, is this a forgery
or is this the real thing?

13:08.585 --> 13:11.281
Well, there is no real
Gospel of Mary, Federman.

13:11.355 --> 13:14.347
The original would be a fake.

13:14.424 --> 13:18.360
All right. So is this
a real fake or a fake fake?

13:18.428 --> 13:20.362
- [Cell Phone Ringing]
- [Gasps]

13:20.430 --> 13:22.364
It's me.

13:23.967 --> 13:27.334
Yes? Nothing new.
No, I can hear you.

13:27.404 --> 13:29.634
It's just your voice is...

13:29.706 --> 13:34.040
There's like a crackly sound
and then I hear the syllables.

13:34.111 --> 13:36.944
- Stop yelling.
Yelling isn't helping the situation.
- Hmm.

13:37.014 --> 13:40.108
Just talk.
You're breaking up.

13:40.184 --> 13:42.675
No. Let me call you back.
Okay.

13:44.421 --> 13:47.857
Yeah, I'm telling you.
I'm going through a crypt.

13:48.926 --> 13:51.861
- ##[Organ]
- [Gasps]

14:14.785 --> 14:17.049
Wow.

14:29.333 --> 14:31.927
Oh, my God.

14:37.940 --> 14:41.137
[Scully] Now, Wayne,
I'm sure that it was dark in there...

14:41.210 --> 14:44.805
and that your eyes
were playing tricks on you.

14:44.881 --> 14:48.647
And you've been influenced
by ghost stories and horror movies...

14:48.718 --> 14:51.050
that take place in crypts
and graveyards.

14:51.120 --> 14:55.921
And you hallucinated this vision
of these dancing bones...

14:55.992 --> 14:59.393
trying to reconstruct this bowl.

14:59.462 --> 15:01.396
No, I didn't hallucinate.

15:01.464 --> 15:03.830
That was mechanical or C.G.I.

15:03.900 --> 15:06.596
Federman, that wasn't a movie.
That was real life.

15:06.669 --> 15:09.604
The difference being?

15:09.672 --> 15:12.038
Well, I have got
my flavor here.

15:12.108 --> 15:16.442
- So, I appreciate all your help.
I've got a movie to write.
- You're leaving?

15:16.512 --> 15:19.606
- You don't wanna get
to the bottom of this?
- Not especially.

15:19.682 --> 15:23.448
Well, you know, sometimes truth
can be stranger than fiction.

15:23.519 --> 15:26.079
Well, fiction is quicker
than truth and cheaper.

15:26.155 --> 15:29.215
You want my advice?
You're both crazy.

15:29.292 --> 15:31.226
Why do you say that?

15:31.294 --> 15:33.990
Well, you're crazy for believing
what you believe and...

15:34.063 --> 15:37.590
you're crazy for not believing
what he believes.

15:39.535 --> 15:42.971
I'll leave you with that.
Thank you.

15:46.809 --> 15:48.936
I miss him already.

15:49.011 --> 15:53.311
You know, Mulder,
I know that Federman's B.S. Ing you.

15:53.382 --> 15:55.816
So I'm really hesitant
to mention this.

15:55.885 --> 15:59.946
But, um, his story reminds
me of the Lazarus Bowl.

16:00.022 --> 16:02.456
The Lazarus Bowl?

16:02.525 --> 16:05.221
We had this wacky nun in
Catholic school... Sister Callahan.

16:05.294 --> 16:08.320
We used to call her Sr. Spooky
'cause she would tell us
scary stories all the time.

16:08.397 --> 16:11.628
Twisted Sister.
That's my kind of nun, you know.

16:11.701 --> 16:14.261
Well, she would hold up an old piece
of wood with a rusty nail in it.

16:14.337 --> 16:18.296
And she would say,
"This is an actual piece of
the cross Christ's wrist was nailed to."

16:18.374 --> 16:21.901
Or she'd show us a vial
of red liquid...

16:21.978 --> 16:24.242
and say that it was
John the Baptist's blood or something.

16:24.313 --> 16:27.373
She'd be in prison today.
You realize that?

16:27.450 --> 16:31.284
Well, she would tell this story of when
Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead.

16:31.354 --> 16:35.484
And she said that there
was this old woman who was
Lazarus's aunt or something,

16:35.558 --> 16:38.994
- Lazarus's aunt?
- Who was spinning a clay bowl
on a wheel nearby.

16:39.061 --> 16:43.430
And that Christ's words, the
actual incantation to raise the dead,

16:43.499 --> 16:46.161
were recorded in the clay grooves
of the pottery...

16:46.235 --> 16:48.726
just like the way music
is recorded into vinyl.

16:48.804 --> 16:53.969
You see? It's just not true you can't
get good science at Catholic school.
It's a lie.

16:54.043 --> 16:56.511
Well, Sr. Spooky...

16:56.579 --> 16:59.776
says that these words
in the clay...

16:59.849 --> 17:04.752
still have the power to raise the dead
just likeJesus raised Lazarus.

17:04.819 --> 17:08.017
That is a very cool story
coming from you, Scully.

17:08.089 --> 17:11.252
I'll have Chuck Burks
meet you over at my offce.

17:11.327 --> 17:13.590
See if this clay has
Christ's greatest hits on it.

17:13.663 --> 17:18.191
And I'm gonna... I'm gonna go have
another audience with Cardinal O'Fallon.

17:18.267 --> 17:20.201
[Machine Humming]

17:20.269 --> 17:23.170
There's music in the air,
Agent Scully.

17:23.239 --> 17:26.675
See, everything that exists vibrates,
and therefore sings...

17:26.742 --> 17:29.540
the street,
your internal organs,

17:29.612 --> 17:32.672
electricity, everything.

17:32.748 --> 17:35.717
Here, I'll show you.
You see?

17:35.785 --> 17:39.016
This is my voice bouncing around
in the red here.

17:39.088 --> 17:42.854
And all this yellow is ambient sound
that we habitually tune out.

17:42.925 --> 17:44.859
It's the hum of my hardware,

17:44.927 --> 17:48.021
Mulder's porn tapes on pause,
sounds from the street.

17:48.097 --> 17:51.089
Everything we hear
but we don't know we hear...

17:51.167 --> 17:53.601
I can hear it
with this machine.

17:53.669 --> 17:56.467
Oh.

17:56.539 --> 17:59.337
What is it?

18:00.710 --> 18:03.577
## [Indistinct Choral]

18:04.914 --> 18:06.882
Who made this?

18:06.949 --> 18:09.213
We're not sure.

18:09.285 --> 18:11.549
Either a forger by the name
of Micah Hoffman...

18:11.621 --> 18:16.024
or, uh, someone else in the vicinity
ofJesus Christ.

18:17.994 --> 18:20.827
"Buzzinga."

18:20.896 --> 18:23.057
Whoever did it is some kind
of a musical genius.

18:23.132 --> 18:26.329
This clay is vibrating in all
the keys at once. It's heavenly.

18:26.402 --> 18:29.997
[Mulder] Can you translate
what it says there for me, please?

18:32.375 --> 18:34.536
Did you recover them
from the crypt?

18:34.610 --> 18:36.305
Yes.

18:42.385 --> 18:46.981
"And then Jesus took his beloved
Mary Magdalene in an embrace.

18:47.056 --> 18:51.755
"An embrace not of God and woman,
but of man and woman.

18:51.827 --> 18:55.695
"And Jesus said to Mary,
'Love the body...

18:55.765 --> 18:58.962
"'for it is all of the soul...

18:59.035 --> 19:01.503
that our senses can perceive."'

19:02.672 --> 19:04.772
And how about these?

19:04.905 --> 19:07.465
These appear to be copies
of the original.

19:07.541 --> 19:11.602
- Rough drafts.
- How?

19:11.678 --> 19:14.374
They're all forgeries, sir.

19:16.116 --> 19:19.051
Did you buy these
from Micah Hoffman?

19:22.623 --> 19:24.557
I thought they were real.

19:24.625 --> 19:26.991
Yeah, I can understand that.
Hoffman was a master.

19:27.060 --> 19:31.121
My partner had them analyzed,
and they're indistinguishable
from the real thing.

19:31.198 --> 19:34.565
The paper is authentic, the ink,
the hand, the diction, everything.

19:34.635 --> 19:37.570
Hoffman was also
an explosives expert.

19:37.638 --> 19:41.665
Do you have any idea what he might have
been doing with a bomb in the crypt?

19:44.111 --> 19:47.808
Can you think of anybody who might have
wanted to kill Micah Hoffman?

19:47.881 --> 19:50.975
No.

19:51.051 --> 19:54.077
Why were you hiding
the documents, sir?

19:55.255 --> 20:00.056
When Micah came to me...
with these,

20:00.127 --> 20:03.221
as I then thought
ancient texts,

20:03.297 --> 20:06.198
and our experts
verified them,

20:06.266 --> 20:09.599
it exploded a bomb
in my heart.

20:09.670 --> 20:14.164
The Christ that I loved
was not the Christ in these texts.

20:14.241 --> 20:17.404
So you bought them
in order to hide them.

20:20.480 --> 20:24.416
To keep others from
feeling the despair...

20:25.586 --> 20:29.352
and the anger that I felt.

20:32.492 --> 20:37.259
To protect people from what I can
now see they needed no protection from.

20:37.331 --> 20:39.925
Why didn't you just
destroy the documents yourself?

20:40.000 --> 20:42.867
I thought they were real.

20:42.936 --> 20:46.030
I hated them.
I despised them.

20:46.106 --> 20:49.041
I would have liked to destroy them,
but I couldn't.

20:53.547 --> 20:56.107
Is being made a fool of
a crime, Agent Mulder?

20:56.183 --> 20:59.380
I'd be doing life
if it were, sir.

21:02.990 --> 21:05.254
- [Ringing]
- Scully.

21:05.325 --> 21:09.318
[Mulder]
Hey, Scully, it's me. Can you horn in
on the Hoffman autopsy for me?

21:09.396 --> 21:12.627
- Why?
- I got a feeling Hoffman
was dead before he died.

21:12.699 --> 21:16.658
He was blackmailing O'Fallon with those
forgeries. Maybe O'Fallon retaliated.

21:16.737 --> 21:18.671
Mulder, this bowl...

21:18.739 --> 21:22.470
Your buddy Chuck Burks says that it has
properties he's never seen before.

21:22.542 --> 21:26.239
- [Line Beeps]
- Hold on a second. That's my other line.

21:26.313 --> 21:28.508
- Mulder.
- [Federman] Agent Mulder?

21:28.582 --> 21:30.914
It's Wayne/Federman out in L.A.

21:30.984 --> 21:34.977
- I can't talk about the case.
- That's all right.
Skin man's keeping me in the loop.

21:35.055 --> 21:38.582
Listen. Who do you see
playing you in the movie?

21:38.659 --> 21:43.028
- I'm in the movie?
- It's a character loosely based on you.

21:43.096 --> 21:48.193
- It's more of an amalgamation.
- Hold on a second, Wayne.

21:48.268 --> 21:51.931
- Sr. Spooky, I gotta take this.
- I'll call you after the autopsy.

21:52.005 --> 21:54.064
Thanks.

21:54.141 --> 21:58.043
- How 'bout Richard Gere?
- [Laughing Hysterically]

21:58.111 --> 22:00.306
Yeah, okay.
Seriously.

22:00.380 --> 22:04.009
What if I said to you
the name Garry Shandling?

22:04.084 --> 22:07.485
Wayne, you're breaking up. It sounded
like you said Garry Shandling.

22:07.554 --> 22:11.354
Garry Shandling signed on to play
the amalgamation loosely based on you.

22:11.425 --> 22:14.883
And Tea Leoni's playing the amalgamation
loosely based on your partner.

22:14.962 --> 22:17.123
You stud.
The movie's called The Lazarus Bowl.

22:17.197 --> 22:21.293
- How do you know about the Lazarus Bowl?
- The Skin man.

22:21.368 --> 22:25.099
Listen, Shandling and Leoni
wanna meet you guys.

22:25.172 --> 22:27.868
Get your flavor.
It's an actor type thing.

22:27.941 --> 22:31.468
Come on out to the studio on our dime.
We'll make it nice.

22:31.545 --> 22:35.003
Hey, who's... Well, then who's
gonna play Skinner in the movie?

22:35.082 --> 22:37.983
- Richard Gere.
- [Stammering]

22:38.051 --> 22:41.111
Fracturing of skull
and surface abrasions...

22:41.188 --> 22:44.851
initially consistent
with concussive force injuries.

22:44.925 --> 22:49.794
I am, uh, now weighing the heart
which is... relatively normal,

22:49.863 --> 22:52.457
although somewhat large.

22:54.534 --> 22:57.002
- I'm gonna need that
when you're done with it.
- [Gasps]

22:57.070 --> 22:59.004
Oh, my God!

23:02.309 --> 23:04.174
Hoo-yeah!

23:09.416 --> 23:13.546
- Who are you?
- I am who I am.

23:16.823 --> 23:20.088
Uh-uh.
[Speaking Latin]

23:28.402 --> 23:31.394
Ow! Damn it!

24:05.437 --> 24:07.632
What'd you find, Scully?

24:07.706 --> 24:12.405
In Micah Hoffman's stomach there were
traces of red wine and strychnine.

24:12.477 --> 24:16.277
Man, oh, Manischewitz.
Communion wine I bet.

24:16.348 --> 24:20.842
I bet O'Fallon poisoned Hoffman,
then placed his body near the
explosion to cover his tracks.

24:20.919 --> 24:23.387
That's possible, Mulder.

24:23.455 --> 24:25.889
I could get a warrant
for O'Fallon.

24:25.958 --> 24:29.485
[O'Fallon]
You are the one God, living and true.

24:29.561 --> 24:32.052
Through all eternity
you live an unapproachable life.

24:32.130 --> 24:36.362
Mulder, let's allow
the man some dignity, okay?

24:36.435 --> 24:38.960
You fill your creatures
with every blessing...

24:39.037 --> 24:42.837
and lead all men
to the joyful vision of your life.

24:42.908 --> 24:46.503
In our joy, we sing to your glory
with all the choirs of angels.

24:46.578 --> 24:49.775
Holy, holy, holy Lord.

24:49.848 --> 24:52.578
God of power and might.

24:52.651 --> 24:55.779
Heaven and earth are full
of your glory.

24:55.854 --> 24:58.254
Hosanna in the highest.

24:58.323 --> 25:02.259
Blessed is he who comes
in the name of the Lord.

25:02.327 --> 25:05.296
Hosanna in the highest.

25:20.445 --> 25:22.811
[Speaks Latin]

25:26.785 --> 25:29.948
LordJesus Christ,
you said to your apostles,

25:30.022 --> 25:34.083
"I leave you in peace.
My peace I give you."

25:34.159 --> 25:36.593
Let's get this over with.

25:38.163 --> 25:42.259
And grant us the peace
and unity of your kingdom. Amen.

25:42.334 --> 25:46.771
Augustine O'Fallon, you're under arrest
for the murder of Micah Hoffman.

25:46.838 --> 25:49.204
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Oh, my God.

25:49.274 --> 25:52.402
- Anything you say can and will
be used against you in...
- Mulder.

25:52.477 --> 25:55.241
Do you see what I see?

25:57.916 --> 25:59.941
Yes, I do.

26:00.018 --> 26:03.112
- [Scully] Is that Micah Hoffman?
- [O'Fallon] Yes, it is.

26:08.727 --> 26:12.595
Misidentification of a corpse
and subsequent unrequested autopsy.

26:12.664 --> 26:16.498
Sir, the dead man looked
very much like Micah Hoffman.

26:16.568 --> 26:18.798
He had Hoffman's I.D. On him.

26:18.870 --> 26:23.432
Agent Scully, if I'm carrying
Marilyn Monroe's purse,

26:23.508 --> 26:26.204
do you assume that
I slept with J.F.K.?

26:30.749 --> 26:34.947
Agent Mulder, the F.B.I.
Has always prided itself with
the speedy expedition of cases.

26:35.020 --> 26:37.989
But this is the first time, and I hope
you're as proud of this as I am,

26:38.056 --> 26:41.219
that we've ever attempted
to pursue a murder case where
the victim was still alive!

26:41.293 --> 26:43.488
A bomb went off.
A crime's been committed.

26:43.562 --> 26:46.156
There's a dead body
nobody seems to give a damn about.

26:46.231 --> 26:48.165
O'Fallon's been less
than forthcoming.

26:48.233 --> 26:50.565
And Hoffman at the very least
is guilty of forgery and extortion.

26:50.635 --> 26:53.001
Agent Mulder, you will
leave O'Fallon alone.

26:53.071 --> 26:57.906
You will leave Hoffman alone!
Agent Scully, you'll put your
trigger-happy scalpel away!

26:59.111 --> 27:02.274
Best case scenario,
you get to keep your jobs.

27:02.347 --> 27:06.215
Worst case, O'Fallon and
the Church bring a huge embarrassing
lawsuit against the bureau...

27:06.284 --> 27:10.220
which will feature you two
as the sacrificial lambs!

27:10.288 --> 27:12.347
As of right now,

27:14.392 --> 27:18.260
I'm forcing you to take
a four-week leave, effective
immediately pending review.

27:22.100 --> 27:25.092
I think this whole Richard Gere thing
is going to Skinner's head.

27:25.170 --> 27:29.038
- We're off this case, Mulder.
- [Burks] Compadres.

27:30.642 --> 27:33.668
I teased out something very fabulous
from your pottery there.

27:35.747 --> 27:37.908
- Layered in under the ambience...
- [Voice Speaking]

27:37.983 --> 27:40.008
There.
Guess what language that is.

27:40.085 --> 27:42.952
- Chuck, I've had a bad day.
- It's a dead language.

27:43.021 --> 27:46.354
I had a linguist in here to listen
to the recording. It's Aramaic.

27:46.424 --> 27:48.358
That's the language that
Christ spoke.

27:49.628 --> 27:52.324
Did your, uh, linguist
happen to translate it?

27:52.397 --> 27:54.388
Yes, he did.
It's in two parts.

27:54.466 --> 27:58.095
The first part, here,
roughly translates as,

27:58.170 --> 28:02.231
"I am the walrus. I am the walrus.
Paul is dead. Goo goo g'joob."

28:02.307 --> 28:04.935
Although there is
no Aramaic word for walrus.

28:05.010 --> 28:08.275
So it literally says,
"I am the bearded cow-like sea beast."

28:08.346 --> 28:12.749
- What's the second part?
- The second part's
a little freakier. Here.

28:12.817 --> 28:15.945
- What is it?
- It appears to be one man...

28:16.021 --> 28:19.081
commanding another
to rise from the dead.

28:19.157 --> 28:22.615
[Voice Continues]

28:22.694 --> 28:24.628
Lazarus?

28:32.904 --> 28:36.897
I am becomeJesus Christ.

28:41.580 --> 28:44.276
I am become skeptical.

28:45.584 --> 28:48.451
There I was totally bumming
after Altamont.

28:48.520 --> 28:51.387
And I thought, throw in the towel
and go to law school...

28:51.456 --> 28:56.257
or continue to fight and become a forger
of scandalous religious documents.

28:56.328 --> 28:59.855
I suppose that's a choice every young,
gifted, American male is faced with.

29:01.099 --> 29:03.090
I knew O'Fallon from college.

29:03.168 --> 29:06.069
- He was a divinity professor of mine.
- At Columbia?

29:06.137 --> 29:09.197
Yeah. And he is a decent man,
but with an overweening pride...

29:09.274 --> 29:12.971
and sense of responsibility
born of a fundamental...

29:13.044 --> 29:15.569
lack of respect
for the human animal.

29:15.647 --> 29:18.138
He believes in God,
but not in man...

29:18.216 --> 29:21.515
and man's ability to choose
to live in freedom.

29:21.586 --> 29:25.147
He has Christ in his brain,
but not in his heart.

29:25.223 --> 29:27.623
[Scoffs]
So, uh,

29:27.692 --> 29:29.887
you created a Christ...

29:29.961 --> 29:34.398
in these forgeries that was more suited
to your particular world view?

29:34.466 --> 29:37.367
Yeah, but before I could write
like Christ, I had to become him,

29:37.435 --> 29:41.633
in much the same way I imagine an actor
who plays a part becomes that part.

29:41.706 --> 29:44.208
So I immersed myself
in Jesus Christ.

29:44.341 --> 29:46.639
Not just the Church
and teachings,

29:46.710 --> 29:51.545
but the man,
the custom of his time,

29:51.615 --> 29:56.245
the language, the vibe,
the feeling of Christ.

29:56.320 --> 29:59.289
So why didn't O'Fallon
and the elders...

29:59.356 --> 30:01.517
go outside the Church
for authentification?

30:01.592 --> 30:06.723
Because the forgeries
are too damning of the Church.
They couldn't risk the exposure.

30:07.798 --> 30:09.732
But then...

30:09.800 --> 30:12.530
something truly weird
came over me.

30:12.603 --> 30:14.730
Remorse?

30:16.240 --> 30:18.731
Conversion, Agent Scully.

30:18.809 --> 30:20.834
The lightning bolt...

30:20.911 --> 30:25.245
that transformed Saul to Paul
on the road to Damascus.

30:27.517 --> 30:30.850
One day, I was not just
impersonating Jesus Christ,

30:31.922 --> 30:33.856
I had become him.

30:36.526 --> 30:39.017
That's why I blew up the crypt.

30:39.096 --> 30:42.259
The forgeries were blasphemous
and needed to be destroyed.

30:46.003 --> 30:47.937
How did your...

30:48.005 --> 30:51.532
cell phone get on
the dead man in the crypt?

30:55.779 --> 30:59.650
God works in mysterious ways.

30:59.650 --> 31:00.048
God works in mysterious ways.

31:00.117 --> 31:04.486
[Speaking Along With TV]
Well, as long as they can think,
we'll have our problems.

31:04.554 --> 31:06.852
But those whom they are
using cannot think.

31:06.923 --> 31:10.484
They are the dead brought to assimilate
life by our electrode attempts.

31:10.560 --> 31:12.494
- [Knocking]
- It's open!

31:12.562 --> 31:15.360
You know, it's an interesting thing
when you consider...

31:15.432 --> 31:17.627
you Earth people
who can think...

31:17.701 --> 31:20.602
are so frightened
by those who cannot... the dead.

31:20.671 --> 31:23.333
Couldn't sleep either, huh?

31:23.407 --> 31:27.207
- Plan 9 from Outer Space?
- Yeah.

31:27.277 --> 31:29.575
It's the Ed Wood
investigative method.

31:29.646 --> 31:32.615
This movie is so profoundly bad
in such a childlike way...

31:32.683 --> 31:35.208
that it hypnotizes
my conscious critical mind...

31:35.285 --> 31:38.277
and frees up my right brain
to make socio-poetic leaps.

31:38.355 --> 31:40.448
And I started flashing
on Hoffman and O'Fallon.

31:40.524 --> 31:43.322
How there's this
archetypal relationship.

31:43.393 --> 31:46.055
Like Hoffman's Jesus
to O'Fallon's Judas.

31:46.129 --> 31:49.257
Or Hoffman's Jesus to O'Fallon's
Dostoyevsky's grand inquisitor.

31:49.333 --> 31:51.699
Or Hoffman's Jesus
to O'Fallon's St. Paul.

31:51.768 --> 31:55.761
How 'bout Hoffman's Roadrunner
to O'Fallon's Wile E. Coyote?

32:00.610 --> 32:03.010
- Mulder?
- Yeah?

32:05.482 --> 32:09.441
Do you think it's at all possible
that Hoffman is reallyJesus Christ?

32:09.519 --> 32:11.612
Are you making fun of me?

32:11.688 --> 32:13.383
No.

32:13.457 --> 32:15.391
Well, no, I don't.

32:15.459 --> 32:18.656
But crazy people
can be very persuasive.

32:18.729 --> 32:21.197
Well, yes, I know that.

32:26.570 --> 32:29.971
Maybe true faith is really
a form of insanity.

32:30.040 --> 32:33.407
- Are you directing that at me?
- No!

32:33.477 --> 32:37.072
I'm directing it at myself
and at Ed Wood.

32:40.684 --> 32:44.780
Well, you know, even a broken clock
is right 730 times a year.

32:52.996 --> 32:54.930
- How...
- Forty-two.

32:56.433 --> 33:00.494
- You've seen this movie 42 times?
- Yes.

33:00.570 --> 33:02.765
Doesn't that make you sad?

33:03.974 --> 33:05.908
It makes me sad.

33:05.976 --> 33:09.275
- You ever been to Hollywood?
- A couple of times a few years ago.

33:09.346 --> 33:11.644
You're going to be there
in the morning.

33:11.715 --> 33:15.651
Just a few minutes from Hollywood
in the town of San Fernando.

33:15.719 --> 33:19.120
Reports have come in
of saucers flying so low...

33:19.189 --> 33:23.523
You know, Scully, we've got four-weeks
probation vacation and nothing to do.

33:23.593 --> 33:26.960
And Wayne Federman's invited us out
to L.A. To watch his movie being filmed.

33:27.030 --> 33:30.591
And God knows I could use
a little sunshine.

33:30.667 --> 33:32.532
Scully?

33:35.172 --> 33:37.663
[Scully]
California, here we come.

33:49.952 --> 33:52.216
- [Bell Rings]
- [Man] Beep, beep.

34:27.790 --> 34:30.657
Agents?
So glad you could hang.

34:32.561 --> 34:35.223
Come on. I want you to meet the people
that are gonna play you.

34:35.297 --> 34:40.324
- Garry Shandling, Tea Leoni,
this is Agents Mulder and Scully.
- It's a pleasure.

34:40.402 --> 34:43.838
- Nice to meet you. Big fan. Fox Mulder.
- No kidding?

34:46.809 --> 34:50.210
You know, while I've got
you here, maybe, uh...

34:50.279 --> 34:52.873
maybe you could show me
how to run in these things.

34:52.947 --> 34:56.076
Right over here I was thinking
'cause, I tell you...

34:56.150 --> 34:59.120
I mean, I'm having a hell
of a time with these heels.

34:59.188 --> 35:01.315
- Hey, uh...
- Hi.

35:01.390 --> 35:04.052
How are you? Seriously, listen.
Can I ask you something?

35:04.126 --> 35:07.892
- Sure.
- Do you dress to the left
or to the right?

35:10.766 --> 35:12.700
What... What do you mean?

35:12.768 --> 35:15.794
[Clears Throat]

35:15.871 --> 35:18.840
Look, when I play a character,
I need to find his center,

35:18.907 --> 35:20.841
his sort of rudder, so to say.

35:20.909 --> 35:23.707
And then everything
comes from that.

35:26.915 --> 35:28.849
Uh...

35:30.452 --> 35:32.886
I guess mostly to the left.

35:34.356 --> 35:36.290
Mostly?

35:36.358 --> 35:38.952
Most of the time.

35:39.027 --> 35:41.962
Most of the time...
to the left.

35:42.030 --> 35:43.964
Mm-hmm.

35:44.032 --> 35:45.966
Wardrobe!

35:47.402 --> 35:49.336
- [Bell Ringing]
- [Man] Rolling!

35:49.404 --> 35:51.338
And "rollando."

35:51.406 --> 35:55.103
Come on, now. Kick it in the ass.
And action, zombies!

35:55.177 --> 35:58.943
- [Screaming]
- What is this?

35:59.014 --> 36:02.677
- [Director]
Cut. Go ahead, ruin my career.
- What seems to be the problem?

36:02.751 --> 36:05.618
What the hell is this?
What the hell's in my mouth?

36:05.687 --> 36:07.848
What is Tea Leoni's
shoulder made out of?

36:07.923 --> 36:10.585
Craft services, what is
Tea Leoni's shoulder made of?

36:10.659 --> 36:14.652
- Turkey, just like you asked for.
- Turkey.

36:14.730 --> 36:16.960
- Miss Leoni's shoulder's made of turkey.
- Tofu turkey!

36:17.032 --> 36:19.592
Tofurkey!
I asked for Tofurkey!

36:19.668 --> 36:24.833
I'm a vegetarian! Half the zombies
are vegetarians! Oh, my God!

36:24.907 --> 36:27.341
The people are made out of turkey.

36:29.311 --> 36:33.213
- [Mulder] Hello?
- Mulder, it's me. What are you doing?

36:33.282 --> 36:37.013
I'm, uh, working at the computer.
What are you doing?

36:37.085 --> 36:42.887
I'm, uh, packing. Just getting ready
for our trip back to D.C. Tomorrow.

36:42.958 --> 36:47.793
Scully, I was just thinking
about Lazarus, Ed Wood and
those Tofurkey-eatin' zombies.

36:47.863 --> 36:50.058
How come when people
come back from the dead,

36:50.132 --> 36:52.157
they always wanna
hurt the living?

36:52.234 --> 36:55.829
Well, that's because people can't really
come back from the dead, Mulder.

36:55.904 --> 36:59.135
Ghosts and zombies are just projections
of our own repressed...

36:59.208 --> 37:03.304
cannibalistic and sexual fears
and desires.

37:03.378 --> 37:05.812
They are who we fear
that we are at heart.

37:05.881 --> 37:09.339
Just mindless automatons
who can only kill and eat.

37:09.418 --> 37:11.943
Party pooper.
Well, I got a new theory.

37:12.020 --> 37:15.547
I say that when zombies try to eat
people, that's just the first stage.

37:15.624 --> 37:19.685
They've just come back from being dead,
so they're gonna do
all the things they missed.

37:19.761 --> 37:22.696
So first they're gonna eat,
then they're gonna drink.

37:22.764 --> 37:25.062
Then they're gonna dance
and make love.

37:25.133 --> 37:28.591
Oh, I see. So it's just that we never
get to stay with them long enough...

37:28.670 --> 37:31.639
to see the gentler side
of the undead.

37:31.707 --> 37:33.641
- Exactly.
- [Line Beeps]

37:33.709 --> 37:37.076
Hold on a second.
That's my other line. Hello?

37:37.145 --> 37:40.740
Agent Mulder, it's Assistant
Director Skinner. I hope
I didn't catch you at a bad time.

37:40.816 --> 37:42.943
No, sir.
I'm just at the computer.

37:43.018 --> 37:47.614
I wanted to apologize for coming
down so hard on you during
the Hoffman/O'Fallon case.

37:47.689 --> 37:50.556
Oh. I appreciate that, Skin man.

37:50.626 --> 37:52.560
- Don't call me that.
- Yes, sir.

37:52.628 --> 37:56.928
- Um, where are you now?
- I'm right underneath you.

37:56.999 --> 38:00.765
I'm in L.A. At the same hotel as you,
right below you and Agent Scully.

38:00.836 --> 38:04.169
Federman got me an associate producer
credit on the movie.

38:04.239 --> 38:06.537
A.P. Skinner, huh?

38:08.710 --> 38:11.804
Uh, so what are you
up to right now, sir?

38:11.880 --> 38:14.974
I'm taking a bubble bath.

38:15.050 --> 38:16.984
Uh, hold on just one second, sir.

38:19.288 --> 38:22.485
Hey, Scully, Skin man is calling me
from a bubble bath.

38:22.557 --> 38:24.548
It's still me, Mulder.

38:24.626 --> 38:29.859
Uh, sorry. Just-Just hold on
one second, sir.

38:29.931 --> 38:31.865
- Scully?
- Yeah.

38:31.933 --> 38:34.128
Skinner is calling me
from a bubble bath.

38:34.202 --> 38:37.330
Wow. He's really gone Hollywood.

38:37.406 --> 38:39.931
- Totally.
- You know, Mulder,

38:40.008 --> 38:43.944
speaking of Hollywood, I think that
Tea Leoni has a little crush on you.

38:44.012 --> 38:48.312
Oh, yeah, right. Like Tea Leoni's
ever gonna have a crush on me.

38:48.383 --> 38:50.943
I think that Shandling
likes you a bit too.

38:51.019 --> 38:53.022
Really?

38:55.324 --> 38:57.656
I love you, Scully.

38:57.726 --> 39:00.251
- No, ifs, ands or...
- "Bs."

39:03.565 --> 39:07.126
[Leoni]
Wait. Wait, Mulder. I can't.

39:07.202 --> 39:09.534
[Shandling] I know this feels
wrong because we're friends...

39:09.605 --> 39:12.233
and we treat each other
as equals, but...

39:12.307 --> 39:14.935
No. No, it's not that.
It's not that.

39:15.010 --> 39:16.944
Well, what then?

39:20.983 --> 39:24.316
I'm in love with Assistant
Director Walter Skinner.

39:24.386 --> 39:29.517
- That's it, Scully.
I just can't take it anymore.
- Shh, Mulder. Sit down.

39:29.591 --> 39:33.652
- What does he have that I don't have?
- A bigger flashlight.

39:33.729 --> 39:36.197
[Laughter]

40:03.025 --> 40:05.755
I've been looking
all over for you.

40:12.067 --> 40:14.331
They got it so wrong, Scully.

40:19.007 --> 40:22.101
I got a page from
the Washington bureau.

40:24.246 --> 40:27.079
Micah Hoffman
was murdered tonight.

40:27.149 --> 40:30.448
Murdered in his own home
by Cardinal O'Fallon,

40:30.519 --> 40:32.453
who then hanged himself.

40:33.789 --> 40:35.723
A murder/suicide.

40:35.791 --> 40:37.554
It's Jesus and Judas, Scully.

40:37.626 --> 40:41.221
Well, it's all over now.

40:41.296 --> 40:43.287
No, no.

40:43.365 --> 40:46.198
It's just beginning.

40:46.268 --> 40:48.964
Hoffman and O'Fallon
were these complicated,

40:49.037 --> 40:51.597
flawed, beautiful people.

40:51.673 --> 40:54.767
And now they'll just be remembered
as jokes because of this movie.

40:54.843 --> 40:58.802
The character based on O'Fallon
is listed in the credits
as "Cigarette-Smoking Pontiff."

40:58.881 --> 41:01.145
How silly is that?

41:02.284 --> 41:04.218
- Pretty silly.
- And what about us?

41:04.286 --> 41:07.255
How are we gonna be remembered
now because of this movie?

41:07.322 --> 41:09.256
Well, hopefully
the movie will tank.

41:09.324 --> 41:13.658
What about all the dead people
who are forever silent and
can't tell their stories anymore?

41:13.729 --> 41:16.926
They're all gonna have to
rely on Hollywood to show
the future how we lived.

41:16.999 --> 41:19.832
And it'll all become
oversimplified...

41:19.902 --> 41:23.770
and trivialized and
Cigarette-Smoking "Pontificized"...

41:23.839 --> 41:26.535
and become as plastic
and meaningless...

41:26.608 --> 41:30.135
as this stupid plastic
Lazarus Bowl.

41:30.212 --> 41:33.443
I think the dead are beyond caring
what people think about them.

41:33.515 --> 41:36.484
Hopefully we can adopt
the same attitude.

41:36.552 --> 41:40.181
You do know that there aren't
real dead people out there, right?

41:40.255 --> 41:42.849
That this is a movie set?

41:42.925 --> 41:46.952
- [Chuckles]
- The dead are everywhere, Scully.

41:47.029 --> 41:50.055
Well, we're alive.

41:51.433 --> 41:53.367
And we're relatively young.

41:53.435 --> 41:59.169
- And Skinner was so
tickled by the movie...
- I bet he was.

41:59.241 --> 42:01.801
That he has given us
a bureau credit card...

42:01.877 --> 42:04.107
to use for the evening.

42:06.582 --> 42:08.516
Come on.

42:16.491 --> 42:18.516
Mulder, I have something
to confess.

42:18.594 --> 42:22.997
- What's that?
- I'm in love with Associate
Producer Walter Skinner.

42:23.065 --> 42:25.533
[Both Laugh]

42:27.069 --> 42:29.333
Ah, me too.
