WEBVTT

00:05.092 --> 00:06.745
- Excuse me, do you...

00:06.789 --> 00:08.573
excuse me.

00:11.924 --> 00:13.839
Excuse me, do you know where
I can find Sergeant Platt?

00:13.883 --> 00:15.102
- Front desk.

00:17.408 --> 00:20.455
- Sergeant Platt?
I'm Officer Vanessa Rojas.

00:20.498 --> 00:22.370
I've been assigned
to Intelligence.

00:22.413 --> 00:24.676
They said I should
come see you first.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.069
- You moving in?

00:26.113 --> 00:27.853
- No, ma'am.

00:27.897 --> 00:29.986
Am I in the right place?

00:30.030 --> 00:31.596
- Only time will tell.

00:31.640 --> 00:34.164
You have some
paperwork to fill in.

00:34.208 --> 00:36.514
- Cool.
When do you need it by?

00:36.558 --> 00:38.516
- Before you start
your tour of duty today.

00:38.560 --> 00:41.041
But first on the agenda,
go to Headquarters

00:41.084 --> 00:43.043
for your brand new
undercover ID.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.827
Give this to the guys at OCD.

00:44.870 --> 00:47.221
I've already put your
new name into the system.

00:47.264 --> 00:49.745
- Maria Lopez?
- Is there a problem?

00:49.788 --> 00:53.444
- Honestly, it's like the most
clichÃ© Latina name there is...

00:53.488 --> 00:56.926
and I'm part black.
Afro Latina, actually.

00:56.969 --> 00:58.797
- Officer Rojas...

01:00.234 --> 01:02.105
If you make
it in Intelligence--

01:02.149 --> 01:03.846
and that is a big "if."

01:03.889 --> 01:06.544
But if you do,
you will be working undercover.

01:06.588 --> 01:09.808
Now, most of the bad guys
in the city have not undergone

01:09.852 --> 01:11.332
racial sensitivity training,

01:11.375 --> 01:13.029
so they will
assume you are Latina

01:13.073 --> 01:15.988
and should they Google your ass
to make sure that you are

01:16.032 --> 01:17.860
the person
you are pretending to be,

01:17.903 --> 01:20.167
the fact that there's
a thousand Maria Lopezes

01:20.210 --> 01:23.474
in Chicago will work
in your favor, right?

01:24.562 --> 01:26.390
- Copy that.
- Vanessa,

01:26.434 --> 01:28.392
how about I give you
a ride to Headquarters?

01:28.436 --> 01:30.699
Morning Sergeant.
- Detective.

01:32.614 --> 01:35.747
- Oh, uh, what about my locker?
- Ah, ah, ah--later.

01:35.791 --> 01:37.227
Talk about that later.

01:37.271 --> 01:39.142
Let's get a cup of coffee.

01:39.186 --> 01:41.405
- So what the hell was
Platt's deal?

01:41.449 --> 01:43.451
- The deal is--
do not mess with Trudy Platt.

01:43.494 --> 01:45.627
Under no circumstances.
She ain't playing.

01:45.670 --> 01:47.498
- I thought Voight
was our boss.

01:47.542 --> 01:49.805
- Right, he is, but we work
in Platt's house, right?

01:49.848 --> 01:51.415
So she controls the weather.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.461
Piss her off, she can make
it rain all day, every day.

01:53.504 --> 01:56.464
- She sounds old school.
I'll get her to lighten up.

01:56.507 --> 01:57.943
Help! Help me!

01:57.987 --> 01:59.380
- Move, move!

02:00.642 --> 02:03.253
- Someone please help!
- Let's go--stay close.

02:03.297 --> 02:05.429
Stay close.
- Hey, stop that--

02:05.473 --> 02:07.605
- Wait! All right!
Take cover, take cover.

02:07.649 --> 02:10.565
Let her go!
Let her go--do not--

02:10.608 --> 02:13.176
- Back up, back up!
Stop the vehicle.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.352
Stop--I will shoot you.
Stop!

02:17.311 --> 02:19.313
- Rojas, take my radio.

02:19.356 --> 02:21.315
Call backup and an ambo--
and get those plates!

02:21.358 --> 02:23.273
- We need an ambo here,
1200 Washburn.

02:23.317 --> 02:25.188
- Copy that.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.234
- Ma'am, look at me.
Okay--help is on the way.

02:27.277 --> 02:29.627
- Stop the car!

02:31.281 --> 02:33.892
Hey, get out now!

02:38.767 --> 02:42.466
Driver, passenger--
out of the car.

02:42.510 --> 02:45.295
Out of the car, now.
Hands where I can see them.

02:45.339 --> 02:48.168
Hands high!
Turn around slow.

02:50.822 --> 02:52.868
Driver, turn the car off.

03:00.397 --> 03:02.921
Chicago PD.
Everybody stay where you are.

03:02.965 --> 03:05.228
Don't get out of the car.

03:19.068 --> 03:21.940
Stop or I'll shoot!

03:36.868 --> 03:38.870
This is Officer Rojas
of Intelligence.

03:38.914 --> 03:40.872
We have a carjacking
at 1200 Washburn,

03:40.916 --> 03:42.483
multiple victims injured.

03:43.614 --> 03:45.486
- Officer,
what's your call sign?

03:45.529 --> 03:47.052
- I haven't been
assigned one yet.

03:47.096 --> 03:48.576
I just started.

03:56.714 --> 03:58.412
- The whole thing
is a mess, Sarge.

03:58.455 --> 04:00.065
We're basically
looking at three crime scenes.

04:00.109 --> 04:01.937
It started back there
on Washburn with a carjacking

04:01.980 --> 04:03.678
that Atwater and Rojas
responded to.

04:03.721 --> 04:05.854
- The two offenders fled
and crashed into that car.

04:05.897 --> 04:07.943
Then one offender
took off in the car,

04:07.986 --> 04:11.294
the other one Rojas chased down
and he was impaled by rebar.

04:11.338 --> 04:13.731
- So that's our DOA.
- Yeah.

04:13.775 --> 04:16.081
Carjacking victim?
- Yeah, she's a young woman.

04:16.125 --> 04:18.736
She was beaten pretty bad.
She's on her way to Med.

04:18.780 --> 04:21.565
- Listen, did the responding
backup units pick up anything

04:21.609 --> 04:23.219
'cause I was on the zone
and I didn't hear any chatter.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.526
- That's the thing, Sarge.
They didn't call for backup.

04:27.832 --> 04:30.008
- Huh.

04:30.052 --> 04:31.227
- All right, do me a favor.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.272
See if you can
tie this thing up?

04:32.315 --> 04:34.622
- Yeah.
- Talk to me.

04:37.146 --> 04:40.410
- Oh, he don't look too happy.
- That's just how he looks.

04:40.454 --> 04:42.673
- All right,
walk me through this, Kev.

04:42.717 --> 04:44.806
Why didn't you call for backup?

04:44.849 --> 04:46.721
- It was a hot pursuit, Sarge.
Heat of the moment--

04:46.764 --> 04:48.375
everything just
happened real fast.

04:48.418 --> 04:51.073
- Look, Atwater told me
to radio for backup,

04:51.116 --> 04:52.335
but the offender was fleeing.

04:52.379 --> 04:53.858
And if I had stopped,
I would've lost him.

04:53.902 --> 04:55.599
- Hmm.

04:55.643 --> 04:57.427
You know there's
a lot of officers out there

04:57.471 --> 04:59.516
monitoring that radio,
ready to help.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.736
- I know.
It was instinct.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.564
- Instinct.

05:03.607 --> 05:05.609
Well your instinct
just caught us a carjacking,

05:05.653 --> 05:08.656
an officer-involved death,
and a pile of paperwork.

05:10.353 --> 05:12.094
Not a good look
on your first day.

05:17.491 --> 05:19.057
- You all right?
- Yeah.

05:22.104 --> 05:24.324
- What you doing?

05:24.367 --> 05:27.022
- I'm updating the board.
Voight's orders.

05:28.371 --> 05:31.243
-  Boss.
- Huh?

05:31.287 --> 05:32.593
- This is for real?

05:32.636 --> 05:34.116
Antonio's moving
to Puerto Rico for sure?

05:34.159 --> 05:36.988
- It's what he wants.
He's got family there.

05:37.032 --> 05:40.427
Look, end of the day,
it's probably a good decision.

05:41.776 --> 05:45.345
You all know Officer Rojas?
Welcome to Intelligence.

05:45.388 --> 05:47.129
- Thank you.

05:47.172 --> 05:48.478
Okay, I hope
this isn't the part

05:48.522 --> 05:50.175
where I have to make a speech.

05:50.219 --> 05:51.655
- Nothing like that.

05:53.265 --> 05:54.789
Okay, what do we got?

05:54.832 --> 05:56.399
- Straight-up
aggravated carjacking.

05:56.443 --> 05:57.705
The victim's name
is Ruby Garcia.

05:57.748 --> 05:58.923
She's 24.

05:58.967 --> 06:00.708
She's at Chicago Med
with head trauma.

06:00.751 --> 06:02.884
We lodged a BOLO on her
stolen car, nothing yet.

06:02.927 --> 06:04.973
- We ran prints
on our DOA John Doe.

06:05.016 --> 06:07.192
He's not in our system.
No wallet or ID.

06:07.236 --> 06:10.587
- That means we gotta ID his
partner, so talk to your CIs.

06:10.631 --> 06:12.459
Let's get a list
of everyone previously arrested

06:12.502 --> 06:14.591
for carjacking in that area.

06:14.635 --> 06:18.073
Kev, reach out to Major
Accidents, start the paper.

06:18.116 --> 06:19.683
- Yes, sir.

06:20.902 --> 06:22.686
- We've been chasing
a major cartel supply

06:22.730 --> 06:24.209
and we're dropping that
for a carjacking?

06:24.253 --> 06:26.386
- The offender died
while we were chasing him,

06:26.429 --> 06:28.257
so we own it.

06:28.300 --> 06:31.260
Let's just tie it off cleanly
and quickly and move on.

06:31.303 --> 06:33.218
- Sergeant?

06:33.262 --> 06:35.046
What would you
like for me to do?

06:35.090 --> 06:37.092
- I want you to head to Med
and get a victim statement

06:37.135 --> 06:38.093
from this Ruby.

06:38.136 --> 06:39.399
And ride with Upton.

06:39.442 --> 06:40.791
You two are going
to be partnering together.

06:40.835 --> 06:42.489
Jay, you'll ride with Kim.

06:55.502 --> 06:57.199
- Sarge, what just happened?

06:58.418 --> 06:59.854
It takes a lot
of time and trust to build

06:59.897 --> 07:02.073
a partnership that works
and Jay and I are working.

07:02.117 --> 07:04.467
- I know.
- Then why split us up?

07:04.511 --> 07:06.730
- Because I need
to evaluate Rojas

07:06.774 --> 07:08.993
and I know you'll
shoot me straight.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.954
Look, there are a lot
of red flags.

07:12.997 --> 07:16.523
We don't need anybody
out there playing hero ball.

07:17.524 --> 07:18.916
- Sounds like you
have your answer.

07:18.960 --> 07:21.919
- Yeah, well,
I talked to my guys

07:21.963 --> 07:25.923
over at the Academy
and Rojas checked every box.

07:25.967 --> 07:29.405
Top gun, high scores--
I mean, she killed it.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.494
And she's got street
you can't teach.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.278
- But...

07:33.322 --> 07:36.064
- All those accomplishments
are individual.

07:36.107 --> 07:39.459
We gotta know she can
work with this team.

07:41.504 --> 07:43.550
You ever wonder
why you and Halstead

07:43.593 --> 07:45.856
are the only detectives
to join this unit?

07:45.900 --> 07:47.989
Everybody else came in raw.

07:48.816 --> 07:51.688
It's always better
to find the right person

07:51.732 --> 07:54.474
before they learn
the wrong habits.

07:54.517 --> 07:55.866
You understand?

08:01.002 --> 08:02.960
- Then, right as I
pull in the parking lot,

08:03.004 --> 08:05.049
this guy reaches
in my car and pulls me out

08:05.093 --> 08:06.616
and then one of them
was punching me.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.836
- Did you see
where they came from?

08:08.879 --> 08:12.056
- They came from behind me.
I saw them running.

08:12.100 --> 08:15.233
Did you guys find my car yet?
- No, I'm afraid we didn't.

08:15.277 --> 08:17.801
Come on.

08:17.845 --> 08:20.195
This can't be happening.

08:20.238 --> 08:22.327
- What were you doing
in that neighborhood?

08:22.371 --> 08:23.894
- I was going to work.

08:23.938 --> 08:25.679
- And what kind
of work do you do?

08:25.722 --> 08:29.160
- I'm a waitress.
- Like, legit waitress?

08:29.204 --> 08:31.554
- What are you saying?
- I'm just saying

08:31.598 --> 08:33.774
you got a nice ride for
a waitress from Little Village.

08:33.817 --> 08:35.645
- Yeah, and how would you know?

08:35.689 --> 08:37.125
- 'Cause that's
where I grew up.

08:37.168 --> 08:41.042
- Oh--all right,
and look at you now.

08:42.957 --> 08:44.698
In answer to your question,
I'm a legit waitress.

08:44.741 --> 08:46.613
I work at Pescado.

08:48.049 --> 08:50.747
- Okay, well you give us a call
if you think of anything.

08:51.661 --> 08:53.402
- Hey, um...

08:53.445 --> 08:54.838
maybe we can get some coffee

08:54.882 --> 08:56.840
and you can give
me some advice?

08:56.884 --> 08:59.539
I want to try
something new with my life.

09:00.409 --> 09:01.628
- Sure.

09:03.847 --> 09:06.023
- According to our victim,
Ruby, she saw the offenders

09:06.067 --> 09:08.156
running from
the street behind her.

09:08.199 --> 09:10.114
Assuming these geniuses
didn't drive their own car

09:10.158 --> 09:13.204
to a carjacking,
we checked the nearest L.

09:13.248 --> 09:14.815
- Right, and that
takes you to the Pink Line,

09:14.858 --> 09:16.425
which is three blocks south.

09:16.468 --> 09:18.601
This is ten minutes
before the jacking, Sarge.

09:18.645 --> 09:21.735
That's our John Doe right there
during happier times...

09:21.778 --> 09:24.172
before he was impaled.
That's karma for you.

09:24.215 --> 09:26.522
- Why don't you run
facial rec on the partner?

09:26.566 --> 09:28.219
- Already on it.

09:28.263 --> 09:30.221
Felix Rodriguez.
19 with a juvie rap.

09:30.265 --> 09:32.136
Lives in Englewood
with his mama.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.182
- Drag his ass in.

09:34.225 --> 09:35.879
- Let's go.

09:43.931 --> 09:46.934
- I can tell
you're scared, Felix.

09:51.112 --> 09:53.418
You should be.

09:53.462 --> 09:55.899
You're looking at carjacking,

09:55.943 --> 09:58.380
you're looking at battery...

10:01.383 --> 10:03.428
And you're looking at murder.

10:03.472 --> 10:07.955
- No...it wasn't supposed
to go down like this, I swear.

10:07.998 --> 10:09.783
- What's your
partner's name, Felix?

10:09.826 --> 10:11.741
- His name's Miguel.
I think he's from Guatemala.

10:11.785 --> 10:13.047
- Last name?
- Not sure--

10:13.090 --> 10:14.918
I didn't hardly know him.

10:14.962 --> 10:16.441
- You knew him well enough
to jack a car with him.

10:16.485 --> 10:17.921
- He said he'd give me $500

10:17.965 --> 10:19.749
to help him pick up a car.

10:19.793 --> 10:21.621
I didn't know there was
gonna be somebody in it.

10:21.664 --> 10:23.144
- So you were
stealing a specific car?

10:23.187 --> 10:25.189
- Yeah, it was for somebody
that Miguel knew.

10:25.233 --> 10:27.322
I was just along for the ride.
- Look at me.

10:28.932 --> 10:30.673
Then who did you
give the car to?

10:30.717 --> 10:32.762
- Nobody.
I parked it in the street

10:32.806 --> 10:35.156
in Pilsen,
like we were supposed to.

10:39.421 --> 10:40.770
I'm telling you, man.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.729
I was just trying
to make some money.

10:46.907 --> 10:48.299
- A little late
to the party, ain't we?

10:48.343 --> 10:50.258
- Yeah...

10:50.301 --> 10:52.347
afternoon, Officer.

10:52.390 --> 10:54.392
Hey--Ruzek, Intelligence.

10:54.436 --> 10:56.264
What do we got here?
- Just what you see.

10:56.307 --> 10:57.961
The plates were popped,
VIN is scraped.

10:58.005 --> 10:59.746
They tried to make
the car disappear.

10:59.789 --> 11:01.399
I'm still running it
to see if it's hot.

11:01.443 --> 11:03.619
- It's definitely hot.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.926
- Yo, Ruz, come check this out.

11:05.969 --> 11:08.406
You see where the fire
burned back the upholstery?

11:08.450 --> 11:09.712
- Yeah, bro.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.453
- Let me see that
Halligan, my man.

11:12.193 --> 11:15.109
There you go.
Appreciate it.

11:20.070 --> 11:21.506
Pretty sure Beamers
don't come factory-equipped

11:21.550 --> 11:22.725
with drug traps.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.292
- No...

11:27.774 --> 11:30.341
- Hey, Sarge.
So, turns out Ruby's car

11:30.385 --> 11:32.909
was fitted with a high-end,
fireproof drug trap,

11:32.953 --> 11:35.346
which is lucky for us
because it preserved

11:35.390 --> 11:36.870
the drug residue inside,

11:36.913 --> 11:38.393
which the field test
confirmed was heroin.

11:38.436 --> 11:40.569
- So this wasn't a carjacking,
it was a dope rip.

11:40.612 --> 11:41.918
- Exactly.
The Lab told us that

11:41.962 --> 11:43.485
the fingerprint
found inside this trap

11:43.528 --> 11:45.008
is definitely Ruby Garcia's.

11:45.052 --> 11:46.749
- Okay, which means Ruby
wasn't some innocent girl

11:46.793 --> 11:48.969
who got her car jacked.
She's a drug runner.

11:49.012 --> 11:50.840
- Have Jay and Kim
scoop her up.

11:50.884 --> 11:53.190
- Copy that.

12:01.024 --> 12:02.591
- Ten to one she's not home.

12:02.634 --> 12:03.984
- No bet.

12:04.027 --> 12:05.986
- Somebody help!
Help!

12:11.600 --> 12:13.471
- Body.

12:13.515 --> 12:14.559
Hey!
- What'd you see?

12:14.603 --> 12:16.257
- Somebody ran that way.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.998
- Ruby?

12:22.785 --> 12:25.440
- 5021 George--roll one ambo
to the 7300 block of Hamilton.

12:25.483 --> 12:27.877
- Copy that.
5021 George--

12:27.921 --> 12:30.227
- Cancel the ambo.

12:39.410 --> 12:40.847
- COD?
- Deep puncture wounds

12:40.890 --> 12:42.065
to the chest--M.E. says

12:42.109 --> 12:43.414
it looks like a serrated blade.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.416
No evidence of robbery,
sexual assault, struggle.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.767
It was a purposeful,
quiet kill.

12:47.810 --> 12:50.378
- Only the one witness
so far--neighbor who discovered

12:50.421 --> 12:53.076
Ruby's body says he saw
someone running away.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.730
- Give a description
of the offender?

12:54.774 --> 12:57.124
- It was too far away.
Just a guy in a hoodie.

12:57.167 --> 12:58.821
- All right,
we'll talk to the roommate

12:58.865 --> 13:00.910
and search the apartment.
Meanwhile, I want you guys

13:00.954 --> 13:02.607
to keep working the area.

13:02.651 --> 13:05.697
Surveillance cameras,
suspicious person reports...

13:05.741 --> 13:08.352
and let's find the prick
who killed this girl.

13:10.093 --> 13:12.661
- It's horrible.
I just can't believe it.

13:12.704 --> 13:14.315
This is Ruby's room.

13:14.358 --> 13:17.100
Was...oh, my God.

13:17.144 --> 13:18.536
- How long have
you lived with Ruby?

13:18.580 --> 13:21.061
- Um...we've been
roommates for about a year.

13:21.104 --> 13:22.410
- And no one came to the door?

13:22.453 --> 13:24.238
You didn't see her
leave with anyone?

13:24.281 --> 13:25.413
- Uh, I haven't seen
her since yesterday.

13:25.456 --> 13:27.328
- She involved with anyone?

13:27.371 --> 13:29.373
A boyfriend or a guy
you saw her with?

13:29.417 --> 13:31.811
- No...no,
she didn't have a boyfriend.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.377
- Anyone shady in her life?

13:33.421 --> 13:34.944
Someone that
could've threatened her?

13:34.988 --> 13:37.294
- Not that I know of.

13:39.122 --> 13:40.907
- How'd you meet Ruby?

13:40.950 --> 13:42.430
- At Pescado.

13:42.473 --> 13:44.867
She worked there.
We just kind of hit it off.

13:44.911 --> 13:47.130
We talked about how we
wanted to live in Lincoln Park,

13:47.174 --> 13:49.611
but it was way
too expensive, so,

13:49.654 --> 13:52.614
um...we put all of our money
together and we moved in here.

13:55.922 --> 13:58.576
We were living the life.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.404
That's what
we would always say...

14:04.365 --> 14:07.455
- Oh, my God.
It's such a tragedy.

14:07.498 --> 14:10.762
- When was the last
time you saw Ruby?

14:10.806 --> 14:12.634
- Two days ago.

14:12.677 --> 14:15.680
She was supposed
to come into work yesterday.

14:15.724 --> 14:17.769
- How long has she worked here?

14:18.814 --> 14:20.903
- Maybe six months or so.

14:20.947 --> 14:23.688
- We ran Ruby's
social security number, though,

14:23.732 --> 14:26.822
and there's no record of her
employment at your restaurant.

14:27.692 --> 14:29.172
Do you have a reason for that?

14:31.174 --> 14:32.872
- Not trying
to jam you up, Alexa.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.699
We just wanna make sure we tie
this off the right way, so...

14:34.743 --> 14:36.919
- Good.

14:36.963 --> 14:39.095
Okay...

14:39.139 --> 14:42.316
look, I...I've got
a soft spot in my heart

14:42.359 --> 14:44.100
for girls who've had it tough,

14:44.144 --> 14:46.363
so I let them
work here for straight tips.

14:46.407 --> 14:48.104
This way they can keep
collecting benefits

14:48.148 --> 14:49.584
from the state.

14:49.627 --> 14:51.499
I mean, the whole system's
rigged against them, you know,

14:51.542 --> 14:53.631
so I just--I try to help.

14:53.675 --> 14:56.330
And sometimes it...
sometimes it works

14:56.373 --> 14:59.899
and sometimes it bites me
in my ass, you know?

15:01.770 --> 15:03.641
- I hear you.

15:03.685 --> 15:06.557
- We ran Ruby Garcia.
She's got two priors.

15:06.601 --> 15:08.820
One was coke, one was selling
joints to an undercover

15:08.864 --> 15:11.171
when she was 16.
She spent time in Juvie.

15:11.214 --> 15:13.869
- What else?
- Um, okay...

15:13.913 --> 15:15.958
no biological family,
given up for adoption,

15:16.002 --> 15:17.699
grew up in foster care.

15:17.742 --> 15:19.440
It looks like
she had a hard life.

15:19.483 --> 15:21.659
- And a short one.
- M.E.'s confirmed that Ruby

15:21.703 --> 15:23.531
was stabbed with
a serrated knife.

15:23.574 --> 15:27.535
They also found
this on her torso.

15:27.578 --> 15:30.103
- That's a brand.
Looks like the letter, "F."

15:30.146 --> 15:31.669
- Mm-hmm.
All right,

15:31.713 --> 15:33.280
run this through
the Detective Bureau,

15:33.323 --> 15:35.282
see if they've come
across anything similar.

15:35.325 --> 15:37.414
- Well, I spoke
to the Crime Lab--Hailey.

15:37.458 --> 15:40.896
They, uh, pulled the data
from Ruby's GPS.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.072
Mostly non-descript, normal
driving around the city stuff,

15:43.116 --> 15:45.901
but there's one outlier--this
neighborhood in the Wild 100s.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.164
She went there four times
in the last month,

15:48.208 --> 15:50.427
including right
before she got jacked.

15:50.471 --> 15:51.994
- Well that's gotta
be where the weight is kept.

15:52.038 --> 15:53.430
She was picking up
dope from a source.

15:53.474 --> 15:55.215
- Right, so dig in,
talk to your CIs.

15:55.258 --> 15:57.304
Find out who's moving
heroin in that area

15:57.347 --> 15:59.567
and find out who
Ruby was working for,

15:59.610 --> 16:01.525
'cause right now he's looking
good for her murder.

16:01.569 --> 16:03.266
- All right.

16:06.443 --> 16:08.054
- Ruby's made
four trips to the bar--

16:08.097 --> 16:09.751
it's owned by Jose Soto.

16:09.794 --> 16:12.449
DEA's got an open case.
They think Soto's bringing

16:12.493 --> 16:14.843
bulk heroin into the country
for the Cali Cartel.

16:14.886 --> 16:16.976
Bar is legit.
Real business happens upstairs.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.761
- All right, Adam, Kevin,
Upton, you're with me.

16:19.804 --> 16:21.589
Jay and Kim,
breach through the west side

16:21.632 --> 16:23.286
of the building,
but on my orders.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.245
Let's move.
- Sarge...

16:25.288 --> 16:27.464
- I want you to stay outside,
keep eyes on the bar.

16:27.508 --> 16:28.988
Try to avoid the windows.

16:43.132 --> 16:45.482
Hey, hey, hey.

16:45.526 --> 16:47.571
Nice and easy.
Walk this way.

16:47.615 --> 16:49.834
Eyes one me, hands on the
bar.

17:03.587 --> 17:06.068
- Chicago PD, move forward.
Nobody move--hands up!

17:06.112 --> 17:08.549
- Head's up--runner!
- I got him, I got him.

17:08.592 --> 17:10.246
- Go, go, go, go, go.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.031
- On the ground. Everybody on
your knees-- right now.

17:21.127 --> 17:23.694
- Chicago PD.
Hands in the air.

17:23.738 --> 17:26.654
Put your hands in the air!
- Hey--listen to her.

17:26.697 --> 17:28.569
- Now get on your knees.
- Don't look like she playing.

17:28.612 --> 17:30.005
- Get on your knees.

17:32.138 --> 17:34.575
- 12 kilos of heroin, Jose.

17:34.618 --> 17:37.317
That's super
Class X felony, bro.

17:37.360 --> 17:38.970
It's game over.

17:39.014 --> 17:40.798
- Then why are we talking?

17:40.842 --> 17:43.497
- We need you to help us clear
up the murder of Ruby Garcia

17:43.540 --> 17:44.846
who was stabbed
to death last night.

17:44.889 --> 17:47.240
- What's in it for me?
- For you?

17:47.283 --> 17:49.111
Nothing.

17:49.155 --> 17:50.504
There may be something in it

17:50.547 --> 17:52.549
for your kid brother,
Frank, though.

17:54.203 --> 17:57.467
Yeah, we rolled him up, too.

17:57.511 --> 17:59.687
- Come on, man.

17:59.730 --> 18:02.211
My brother ain't
got nothing to do with it.

18:02.255 --> 18:05.649
- Boy was he in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

18:10.959 --> 18:13.527
- I'll tell you
what you need to know...

18:13.570 --> 18:15.572
you don't squeeze
my kid brother.

18:16.399 --> 18:18.880
- Start talking.

18:18.923 --> 18:21.709
- I didn't kill her.
I didn't even know her.

18:21.752 --> 18:23.406
- Dude, she was at your bar.

18:23.450 --> 18:24.712
She had your heroin
in her vehicle.

18:24.755 --> 18:26.453
She lost your drugs.

18:26.496 --> 18:28.411
- Wasn't my drugs anymore.

18:28.455 --> 18:31.240
Deal was done.
I got my end.

18:31.284 --> 18:32.633
She was a mule for the buyer.

18:32.676 --> 18:34.374
- So who was the buyer?

18:34.417 --> 18:37.159
- Never met him.
- You never met him?

18:37.203 --> 18:38.813
- We only do business by text.

18:41.076 --> 18:43.687
- So you're saying you know
nothing about the buyer?

18:43.731 --> 18:45.689
- I know his money's green

18:45.733 --> 18:48.605
and he always sends girls
to pick up the product.

18:48.649 --> 18:51.913
- So you hired
the bangers to jack the car?

18:51.956 --> 18:54.481
You knew it was loaded
and who's gonna suspect the guy

18:54.524 --> 18:56.700
who sold the drugs
to steal the drugs?

18:58.267 --> 19:00.269
- They made it too easy.

19:00.313 --> 19:02.184
Sending cute girls
to pick up drugs?

19:02.228 --> 19:03.620
What was I supposed to do?

19:03.664 --> 19:06.754
But I didn't kill nobody.

19:06.797 --> 19:09.235
- You got an alibi
for 6:00 last night?

19:09.278 --> 19:11.411
- I was at Frank's soccer game.

19:11.454 --> 19:12.803
He lost.

19:16.329 --> 19:17.895
- We checked Soto's alibi.

19:17.939 --> 19:19.593
Three people put him
at his brother's game.

19:19.636 --> 19:21.072
- He could've hired the hit.
- Maybe,

19:21.116 --> 19:22.291
but we don't have
any proof of that.

19:22.335 --> 19:25.076
- Boss--yeah, thank you.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.688
All right, so Soto gave us
the number he was using

19:27.731 --> 19:29.342
to communicate with
this mystery dealer.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.648
It was a burner phone.
It went dark, so I wasn't able

19:31.692 --> 19:33.259
to track that,
but I did track where it was

19:33.302 --> 19:36.479
purchased at Jin's Market
in Pilsen three days ago.

19:36.523 --> 19:37.915
- Okay, call Jay and Kim

19:37.959 --> 19:39.178
and have them
pay this Jin a visit.

19:41.310 --> 19:44.618
- Jin, can you step out here
so we can take a better look?

19:44.661 --> 19:46.794
So this is all the surveillance
of three days ago--

19:46.837 --> 19:48.448
people buying
pay-as-you-go phones?

19:48.491 --> 19:52.887
- Yes, I remember two men
bought phones that day...

19:52.930 --> 19:56.238
uh, here...is the first one.

19:56.282 --> 19:58.632
- Who's the second guy?

19:58.675 --> 20:01.112
- Uh...this guy.

20:01.156 --> 20:03.071
- Eh, not likely.
- Can you rewind?

20:03.114 --> 20:04.464
Go back, yeah.

20:04.507 --> 20:07.118
- Okay, stop.

20:07.162 --> 20:10.034
Her.
- We're looking for a man.

20:10.078 --> 20:12.472
- Says who?

20:13.299 --> 20:16.519
- Do you recognize her?
- I do--that's Ruby's boss.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.920
- The burner used to do
the drug buys was purchased

20:25.963 --> 20:27.661
by Alexa Rivera--42,
she's not on

20:27.704 --> 20:29.140
DEA's or Narcotic's radar.

20:29.184 --> 20:30.446
Based on the amount
of heroin we think

20:30.490 --> 20:32.013
she bought from Soto,
she should be.

20:32.056 --> 20:33.493
- Before she started
a restaurant,

20:33.536 --> 20:35.451
Alexa was a social worker--
she taught

20:35.495 --> 20:37.540
a vocational training class
for at-risk youth.

20:37.584 --> 20:39.194
Ruby was one of her students.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.587
- She got two priors.
One for possession,

20:40.630 --> 20:42.197
one for agg-battery.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.025
She broke the eye socket
of her live-in girlfriend.

20:44.068 --> 20:46.941
- So, what are we waiting for?
Let's bust her.

20:46.984 --> 20:49.291
- All right--based on what?

20:49.335 --> 20:51.293
- Ruby was running drugs
for Alexa,

20:51.337 --> 20:53.948
who has a history of violence,
so when Ruby lost her load,

20:53.991 --> 20:55.819
it makes sense she killed her.
Street justice.

20:55.863 --> 20:58.126
- Well, it's a very good
theory,

20:58.169 --> 21:01.129
but so far we got no evidence
Alexa murdered Ruby.

21:01.172 --> 21:04.263
What we do know
is Alexa's in the drug trade.

21:04.306 --> 21:06.177
So let's catch her dirty.

21:06.221 --> 21:08.267
We'll take her off the street,
then build a murder case.

21:08.310 --> 21:09.616
- She might not be holding,

21:09.659 --> 21:10.834
being her supply
just got ripped.

21:10.878 --> 21:12.227
- Right, there's an opening,

21:12.271 --> 21:13.663
which means
she's looking for product.

21:13.707 --> 21:14.882
I say we lay somebody under

21:14.925 --> 21:16.405
with the bait, Sarge.
See if she bites.

21:16.449 --> 21:18.015
- Mm-hmm.

21:22.629 --> 21:25.893
- Something to drink?
- I'm looking for Alexa Rivera.

21:25.936 --> 21:28.199
Tell her we're
associates of Jose Soto.

21:28.243 --> 21:30.332
- I'm sorry,
Miss Alexa's not around.

21:30.376 --> 21:32.508
- Hmm...

21:32.552 --> 21:35.206
maybe she's in back?

21:35.250 --> 21:36.599
Maybe you could go...

21:38.427 --> 21:40.342
check for me?

21:40.386 --> 21:42.344
- Who did you say
your friend was?

21:42.388 --> 21:43.998
- Jose Soto.

21:46.696 --> 21:48.263
- Thank you.

21:53.616 --> 21:56.706
Looks like we're a go.

21:56.750 --> 21:59.013
Here she comes.

21:59.056 --> 22:01.537
- Hi, is there something
I can help you with?

22:01.581 --> 22:02.973
- Alexa, my name is Jake.

22:03.017 --> 22:04.671
I'd like to talk
some business with you.

22:04.714 --> 22:07.456
- Well, you don't look
like a fish supplier.

22:08.936 --> 22:10.241
- I'm Jose Soto's partner.

22:10.285 --> 22:12.418
- I'm sorry,
Jose...Soto?

22:12.461 --> 22:14.942
- Jose Soto.
I believe you know who he is.

22:14.985 --> 22:17.945
- Uh...mm-mm.
And you are?

22:17.988 --> 22:19.686
- This is my body guard.

22:19.729 --> 22:22.123
- Oh...really?

22:23.254 --> 22:26.388
- Um, look, I understand
you've had some bad luck

22:26.432 --> 22:29.086
since your supply
got disrupted.

22:29.130 --> 22:31.524
I can replace what you lost.

22:31.567 --> 22:34.962
I can give you credit until
you get back on your feet.

22:37.007 --> 22:38.574
- I think you've
made a mistake.

22:38.618 --> 22:40.141
I'm sorry.

22:40.184 --> 22:42.143
- Alexa, Jose--
he can't help you.

22:42.186 --> 22:45.407
He's skipped town.
He's gotta lay low for awhile,

22:45.451 --> 22:47.235
so he asked me
to reach out to you.

22:47.278 --> 22:49.368
He values your relationship.

22:50.586 --> 22:52.632
- Hmm...
- You know, you could call him.

22:52.675 --> 22:54.329
He'll vouch for me.

22:56.549 --> 22:58.638
- I'll be right back.

23:01.162 --> 23:03.773
- This deal ain't happening.
Not with you.

23:07.342 --> 23:09.213
- Take a look around.
It's all women.

23:09.257 --> 23:11.172
She only hires women.

23:14.262 --> 23:15.611
- Well,
we're gonna play it out.

23:15.655 --> 23:17.396
We'll see how it goes, okay?

23:19.006 --> 23:20.790
- I've got an angle.

23:20.834 --> 23:22.923
Grab me.
- What?

23:22.966 --> 23:26.317
- Grab me--make it seem
like we're in a fight.

23:26.361 --> 23:28.581
- What is she talking about?
- Let go of me!

23:28.624 --> 23:31.758
- Hey--hey!
What the hell is going on here?

23:31.801 --> 23:33.237
This is my place of business.

23:33.281 --> 23:35.414
- I apologize.
Would you like to do this?

23:35.457 --> 23:36.806
- No!

23:36.850 --> 23:38.852
I don't know a Jose Soto, okay?

23:38.895 --> 23:40.462
So you need to leave, now.

23:40.506 --> 23:42.551
- Alexa, listen.
- Go--out.

23:44.597 --> 23:47.948
Take care of yourself,
sweetheart.

23:47.991 --> 23:51.473
- What the hell happened?
- I mean, we laid the bait,

23:51.517 --> 23:53.257
she just wasn't gonna bite.

23:53.301 --> 23:54.998
- Vanessa, I was clear--
you were supposed to follow

23:55.042 --> 23:56.783
Adam's lead.
Why'd you go off book?

23:56.826 --> 23:59.786
- Because it wasn't gonna work.
- How do you know that?

23:59.829 --> 24:02.484
- I know Alexa's type.
She's only got women around.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.355
Vulnerable ones--
ones who need her.

24:04.399 --> 24:06.532
She wasn't gonna
talk to this guy.

24:06.575 --> 24:08.359
- Sarge, me and Burgess
sat on Soto the whole time.

24:08.403 --> 24:09.752
Alexa never called him.

24:09.796 --> 24:13.103
- Yeah, for whatever reason,
she got cold feet.

24:13.147 --> 24:15.366
Rojas is right.
She wasn't gonna do the deal.

24:15.410 --> 24:17.630
- Hey, tell them your idea.

24:17.673 --> 24:20.589
- Sergeant,
I know how to get to her.

24:26.116 --> 24:28.379
- Oh--no, no, no, no.
Wait, uh-uh.

24:28.423 --> 24:31.295
Take that to my office.
Miss Bodyguard,

24:31.339 --> 24:34.516
I told you to leave
and I want you to stay away.

24:37.345 --> 24:38.607
What happened to you?

24:40.217 --> 24:42.568
- He got mad at me
for messing up the deal.

24:44.439 --> 24:47.529
- Your boyfriend?
- Yeah...

24:47.573 --> 24:50.358
yeah--it's not the first time.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.709
- All right,
well why did you come here?

24:56.582 --> 24:59.062
- I know where
he's got the dope.

24:59.106 --> 25:00.586
Two keys.

25:00.629 --> 25:02.588
I can steal it
and sell it to you.

25:04.328 --> 25:05.721
Look, I'm in a really
bad place right now,

25:05.765 --> 25:07.941
so I'm willing
to give you a deal.

25:07.984 --> 25:11.379
We both know it's worth 100.
I'll give it to you for 25.

25:11.422 --> 25:14.338
- 20.

25:14.382 --> 25:16.776
Please--look,
I just need some running money.

25:19.039 --> 25:21.345
- Where are you
going to run to, hmm?

25:21.389 --> 25:23.130
Do you have family?

25:24.958 --> 25:26.307
No?

25:33.880 --> 25:36.578
- You have no idea how angry

25:36.622 --> 25:38.754
it makes me
to see you like this.

25:40.626 --> 25:42.802
- Are we gonna do this or not?

25:45.065 --> 25:48.329
- Yeah--yeah,
we're gonna do this.

25:48.372 --> 25:50.592
But just you and me.

25:50.636 --> 25:52.638
Nobody else involved.
Do you understand?

25:58.426 --> 26:00.080
What's your name?

26:00.123 --> 26:01.603
- Maria.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.649
- Maria.

26:03.692 --> 26:05.433
- Maria Lopez.

26:13.180 --> 26:15.574
Now she's late.

26:15.617 --> 26:18.664
- Don't worry,
we got all night.

26:21.101 --> 26:24.626
- Got a blue Nissan Altima
approaching from the south.

26:28.543 --> 26:30.327
- All right,
wait for the exchange,

26:30.371 --> 26:32.547
then move in on my signal.

26:40.511 --> 26:42.905
- You Maria?
- Who are you?

26:42.949 --> 26:45.865
- I'm picking up a package
for Miss Alexa.

26:45.908 --> 26:48.389
- Got a visual of the driver.

26:48.432 --> 26:51.610
It's Karla Moore.
It's Ruby's roommate.

26:51.653 --> 26:55.396
- Oh, man.
Alexa doesn't disappoint.

26:55.439 --> 26:57.093
- Look, that wasn't
part of the deal.

26:57.137 --> 27:00.183
Alexa's supposed to meet me.
My ass is on the line for this.

27:00.227 --> 27:01.707
- I'm just supposed
to pick it up.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.534
- Nah, screw that--
I don't even know you.

27:03.578 --> 27:05.232
Call Alexa--okay,
we're supposed to meet here--

27:05.275 --> 27:06.668
her and I.
That's what she promised.

27:11.238 --> 27:12.805
- We don't have
ears on that call.

27:14.894 --> 27:16.983
- I have to go.

27:17.026 --> 27:18.593
Miss Alexa changed her mind.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.682
She said she doesn't want
the sea bass.

27:20.726 --> 27:22.684
- Sea bass?
What are you talking about?

27:22.728 --> 27:24.251
- She said you can keep it.

27:24.294 --> 27:26.514
- Wait--whatever, okay,

27:26.557 --> 27:28.342
if that's what she wants,
I can sell this to you.

27:28.385 --> 27:31.301
- I'm sorry, that won't work.
- We can still do the deal.

27:31.345 --> 27:33.390
- Nope--deal's off.

27:33.434 --> 27:34.827
- Sarge, you want us
to snatch her up?

27:34.870 --> 27:36.655
- No, we don't wanna
tip off Alexa.

27:36.698 --> 27:39.745
I've got another idea.

27:44.706 --> 27:46.316
- What was Rojas thinking?
She makes the deal,

27:46.360 --> 27:48.405
we follow the drugs,
we bust Alexa.

27:48.449 --> 27:49.798
- She's just following
the terms that were laid out.

27:49.842 --> 27:51.713
She didn't know
it'd go sideways.

27:55.282 --> 27:56.239
- What are you doing?

28:09.252 --> 28:11.777
- We went over this earlier.

28:11.820 --> 28:15.563
I know that was scary, but we
did that for your protection

28:15.606 --> 28:17.870
because we don't Alexa to know
you're talking to the police.

28:17.913 --> 28:19.480
- You don't think
I'll tell her?

28:20.786 --> 28:22.526
- We don't think
it's in your best interests,

28:22.570 --> 28:23.919
given the circumstances.

28:23.963 --> 28:25.921
- All right, Karla,
I'm gonna lay it out for you.

28:27.923 --> 28:30.273
We believe Alexa killed Ruby

28:30.317 --> 28:32.101
because she lost
her load of heroin.

28:32.145 --> 28:34.408
- Are you crazy?
Alexa didn't kill Ruby.

28:34.451 --> 28:35.931
She would never do that.

28:35.975 --> 28:39.674
- Right...
Alexa's a drug dealer.

28:39.718 --> 28:42.329
She used young women
to traffic her drugs

28:42.372 --> 28:45.114
and we know that
you're one of them.

28:45.158 --> 28:49.118
- Her drug supplier,
Jose Soto--

28:51.077 --> 28:54.297
he picked your face
out of a photo array.

28:54.341 --> 28:57.039
He admitted to giving
you dope in the past.

28:59.259 --> 29:00.695
Karla, that puts you
on the hook

29:00.739 --> 29:02.088
for felony trafficking.

29:02.131 --> 29:04.960
- That's 15 to 30 years.

29:08.137 --> 29:11.445
- We understand Alexa
took advantage of you, okay?

29:11.488 --> 29:13.969
We can make
the drug charges go away.

29:14.927 --> 29:18.017
But the only way that's gonna
happen is if you work with us.

29:19.845 --> 29:22.064
You have to wear a wire.

29:22.108 --> 29:25.154
You gotta get Alexa
to confess to murder.

29:29.506 --> 29:31.073
- Like I told you before,

29:31.117 --> 29:33.162
I have nothing
to say to you.

29:49.091 --> 29:50.701
- All right,
what's the deal with Karla?

29:50.745 --> 29:52.268
- She drank the Kool-Aid.
She doesn't believe

29:52.312 --> 29:54.314
that Alexa's capable of murder.

29:54.357 --> 29:57.665
- Yeah, the only person
Karla trusts is Alexa.

29:57.708 --> 29:59.841
All right, so we need
to find some evidence to break

29:59.885 --> 30:01.321
that trust.
What do we got?

30:01.364 --> 30:03.976
- Well, we could bring
Alexa in, sweat her,

30:04.019 --> 30:05.760
get her out
of her comfort zone.

30:06.369 --> 30:08.284
- If she doesn't roll,
then we've tipped our hand.

30:08.328 --> 30:10.634
The only reason we never heard
of her is 'cause she's smart.

30:10.678 --> 30:13.028
- Sarge, we got something.
We sent that brand marking

30:13.072 --> 30:15.422
to Detectives Bureau.
We got a hit from Homicide.

30:15.465 --> 30:17.859
- Julissa Cruz.
Her body was discovered

30:17.903 --> 30:19.382
in Armour Park nine months ago.

30:19.426 --> 30:22.298
Same branding on her
torso as Ruby--letter "F."

30:22.342 --> 30:24.300
- So we pulled
the Homicide file.

30:24.344 --> 30:26.563
Alexa is a person of interest,
but they couldn't make a case.

30:26.607 --> 30:28.827
- So what's Julissa's
connection to Alexa?

30:28.870 --> 30:31.612
- Julissa took Alexa's
vocational training class.

30:31.655 --> 30:34.006
Same as Ruby, same as Karla.

30:34.049 --> 30:36.225
- Maybe let me take a shot?

30:45.060 --> 30:48.020
Hi, Karla.

30:48.063 --> 30:50.936
- Wait, you're a cop?
- I'm Officer Rojas.

30:50.979 --> 30:52.111
- Well, what
the hell do you want?

30:52.154 --> 30:55.027
- I just wanna talk--please.

31:06.255 --> 31:08.127
- You can't trust
anybody in this world.

31:10.912 --> 31:12.522
- Look, and I get
why you feel that way.

31:13.828 --> 31:16.004
You bounced
around foster homes...

31:16.048 --> 31:19.007
but they ain't even your homes

31:19.051 --> 31:21.140
and they sure as hell
ain't your family.

31:21.183 --> 31:23.751
So of course there's
gonna be trust issues.

31:23.794 --> 31:25.971
- And how would you know?

31:28.538 --> 31:30.976
- Foster care is bad
when you're in it,

31:31.019 --> 31:33.282
but it's worse
when you age out.

31:34.457 --> 31:36.416
'Cause all of a sudden
you're out in the world

31:36.459 --> 31:38.984
and you ain't
got nowhere to go.

31:39.027 --> 31:41.900
And these predators
come in all shapes and sizes

31:41.943 --> 31:44.424
and they find you.

31:44.467 --> 31:45.947
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

31:45.991 --> 31:47.601
- Hmm.

31:47.644 --> 31:49.385
You know, mine was a man.

31:49.429 --> 31:53.128
Some older dude.
He had game.

31:53.999 --> 31:56.262
He made me feel good,

31:56.305 --> 31:59.656
bought me nice things,
let me crash at his place.

32:01.441 --> 32:04.009
And he'd tell me
I was his favorite.

32:05.662 --> 32:10.145
And then he burned his freaking
cigarette into my shoulder.

32:10.841 --> 32:12.060
- That sounds like a creep
who wanted

32:12.104 --> 32:14.149
to have sex with a girl.

32:14.193 --> 32:16.760
Alexa's the opposite
of what you're saying.

32:16.804 --> 32:19.067
- Is she?

32:19.111 --> 32:21.330
Then what the hell
is that on your belly?

32:21.374 --> 32:23.854
- This was my choice.
- That's a brand.

32:23.898 --> 32:25.552
That's what they do to cows.

32:25.595 --> 32:27.510
You know,
she's making you her property

32:27.554 --> 32:29.599
and she ain't never
letting you go.

32:29.643 --> 32:32.515
She didn't let Ruby go...
or Julissa.

32:34.517 --> 32:37.738
- Julissa--what do you mean?
- You don't know?

32:37.781 --> 32:39.740
- Julissa's in Seattle.
She moved there last year.

32:39.783 --> 32:41.133
She got a really good job.

32:41.176 --> 32:42.961
- Well,
Julissa's not in Seattle.

32:43.004 --> 32:44.875
She's in a casket.

32:44.919 --> 32:46.486
- What are you talking about?

32:46.529 --> 32:49.880
- They found her body
in Armour Park nine months ago.

32:49.924 --> 32:51.665
- No, that's not true.

32:51.708 --> 32:54.450
Alexa spoke to her
on the phone last week.

32:55.190 --> 32:59.020
- She was stabbed
multiple times in the heart,

32:59.064 --> 33:01.327
just like Ruby.

33:04.504 --> 33:06.549
- No...

33:08.377 --> 33:11.815
No, no, no, no, no.
No.

33:16.559 --> 33:18.605
- They still haven't
found her killer,

33:18.648 --> 33:21.173
but you know who
it was, don't you?

33:38.407 --> 33:40.322
- Remember,
we're waiting for an admission

33:40.366 --> 33:42.542
to Ruby's murder
before we move in.

33:43.891 --> 33:46.067
- Copy--we're in position.

33:46.111 --> 33:48.374
- Got a visual
on the button cam.

33:48.417 --> 33:50.550
- Hey, where were you?
I was calling you.

33:50.593 --> 33:53.031
- I'm sorry, my phone died.

33:53.074 --> 33:55.685
I need to talk to you.
- What's the matter?

33:55.729 --> 33:57.252
- I'm just confused
about Ruby--

33:57.296 --> 33:58.601
I don't understand
what happened.

33:58.645 --> 34:02.257
- I told you--
Ruby got caught up in drugs

34:02.301 --> 34:04.085
and she started hanging
with the wrong people.

34:04.129 --> 34:05.913
- But I never saw her do
drugs.

34:05.956 --> 34:08.220
- Yeah, because she was
being sneaky, mama.

34:08.263 --> 34:10.918
She hid it from you.
From us.

34:10.961 --> 34:12.615
- She said she was
going to meet you.

34:12.659 --> 34:16.402
- No, that's wrong.
Ruby was going to the police

34:16.445 --> 34:20.145
and she betrayed us.
She betrayed our familia.

34:21.798 --> 34:24.279
- So is that why
you killed her?

34:26.542 --> 34:28.501
- You don't know what
you're talking about.

34:28.544 --> 34:31.417
- Alexa, I just want
to know what happened.

34:31.460 --> 34:33.723
I tried to call Julissa.
- Really?

34:33.767 --> 34:35.769
When was that?

34:35.812 --> 34:38.206
- Right before I got here,
but the line was disconnected.

34:39.077 --> 34:41.079
- I thought you said
your phone was dead.

34:41.122 --> 34:42.950
- It is.

34:42.993 --> 34:45.735
I called her before--
I called her before it died.

34:45.779 --> 34:47.215
Alexa, please.

34:47.259 --> 34:48.434
I just wanna know
what happened.

34:48.477 --> 34:51.654
Please.
- Come here, mami.

34:51.698 --> 34:54.179
Mira.

34:54.222 --> 34:56.311
Don't get stressed.
- Okay.

34:56.355 --> 34:58.183
- Okay?
Everything's fine.

34:58.226 --> 35:01.229
Mira, come.
Come here.

35:04.014 --> 35:05.799
You were always my favorite.

35:05.842 --> 35:07.192
- She's gonna kill her.
- There's no weapon,

35:07.235 --> 35:08.845
so we wait for the safe word.

35:10.630 --> 35:12.458
- But I think
you're lying to me.

35:12.501 --> 35:13.937
- I'm telling you--
she's gonna kill her.

35:13.981 --> 35:15.765
- Wait, wait, wait.
- If you're lying to me...

35:15.809 --> 35:17.071
- She's got a weapon.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.638
- I'll keep eyes
till you breach.

35:18.681 --> 35:19.813
- I'm gonna cut your
freaking heart out.

35:19.856 --> 35:21.162
Understand, bitch?

35:25.166 --> 35:26.298
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:26.341 --> 35:28.082
Okay.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.389
- Chicago PD!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:30.432 --> 35:32.695
Whoa.

35:32.739 --> 35:35.568
Everybody put your guns down.

35:35.611 --> 35:38.527
Everybody relax.
Let's stay calm.

35:38.571 --> 35:39.963
All right, Alexa,

35:40.007 --> 35:42.183
I'm Sergeant Hank Voight
and I'm putting my gun away.

35:42.227 --> 35:44.446
I'm here to help you.
Take it easy.

35:44.490 --> 35:48.102
Look, obviously...
there's nowhere to go, okay?

35:48.146 --> 35:50.104
So let's you and I figure out

35:50.148 --> 35:52.280
a peaceful solution--
you and me.

35:52.324 --> 35:54.152
- This is entrapment.
I didn't do anything.

35:54.195 --> 35:57.764
- Nobody is saying
you did, okay?

35:57.807 --> 36:00.636
Now Alexa, just put the--
put the knife down.

36:00.680 --> 36:02.377
- I will cut this bitch!
- Okay, relax.

36:02.421 --> 36:05.989
- I'll cut you, bitch!
- Come on--hey, hey, hey.

36:06.033 --> 36:08.949
- Alexa, put the knife down,

36:08.992 --> 36:11.560
walk outside,
we'll have a conversation here.

36:11.604 --> 36:14.128
- I want my lawyer first.
- Okay.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.651
okay, I'll get you your lawyer,

36:15.695 --> 36:18.001
but you have
to let Karla go first.

36:18.045 --> 36:19.438
Okay?

36:19.481 --> 36:22.136
- Do you know how much
I've done for this girl?

36:22.180 --> 36:24.878
Remember how much
I've done for you?

36:24.921 --> 36:26.967
She was homeless.

36:27.010 --> 36:29.143
I took her off the streets.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.145
- And now she's confused.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.495
You've poisoned her against me.

36:33.539 --> 36:37.151
- Alexa...I hear you,

36:37.195 --> 36:41.242
but we gotta focus
on right now, okay?

36:41.286 --> 36:44.158
I'm willing
to work with you, okay?

36:44.202 --> 36:46.552
But we gotta build trust.
The best way to do that

36:46.595 --> 36:48.293
is to let Karla go.

36:48.336 --> 36:50.338
- You don't get it.
Karla's a victim.

36:50.382 --> 36:51.905
She's mentally ill.

36:51.948 --> 36:55.822
She makes up stories
to protect herself to survive.

36:55.865 --> 36:57.215
You can't believe
anything she says.

36:57.258 --> 36:58.390
- We know that.

36:58.433 --> 37:01.001
We know--and it all works
in your favor.

37:01.044 --> 37:02.959
- Now, don't blow it.

37:03.003 --> 37:05.614
Be smart.
Come on, let her go.

37:05.658 --> 37:07.703
It's the only way.

37:07.747 --> 37:10.532
Come on, Alexa.
Put the knife down.

37:10.576 --> 37:12.273
Put it down.
Let her go.

37:12.317 --> 37:15.929
- Hey, hey, hey--look at me.

37:15.972 --> 37:18.975
It's over--it's over.
Walk to me.

37:19.019 --> 37:21.543
Put the knife down--come on.

37:21.587 --> 37:25.373
Put the...
put the knife down, now.

37:25.417 --> 37:27.506
Now, walk to me.

37:27.549 --> 37:29.334
- Karla, no!

37:29.377 --> 37:31.292
- Drop the knife!

37:31.336 --> 37:33.120
- 5021 Eddie--
we have a stabbing victim.

37:33.163 --> 37:34.991
Roll an ambulance
to 1360 State Street

37:35.035 --> 37:37.298
right now--right now.

37:37.342 --> 37:38.517
- Copy that.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.083
Ambo dispatched.

37:51.660 --> 37:53.401
- Sarge.
- Yeah?

37:53.445 --> 37:55.185
- Alexa didn't make it.

37:55.229 --> 37:57.318
- Get the knife
to the Crime Lab.

37:57.362 --> 37:58.319
- Yeah, it's on its way.

37:58.363 --> 37:59.886
What do you
wanna do with Karla?

37:59.929 --> 38:01.496
Anybody looks
at that video is gonna know

38:01.540 --> 38:02.889
Alexa wasn't armed.

38:02.932 --> 38:04.891
- What video?

38:08.460 --> 38:10.331
- I just heard
from the Crime Lab.

38:10.375 --> 38:12.202
They dismantled the knife
Karla used to kill Alexa

38:12.246 --> 38:14.204
and they found
Ruby's DNA in the hilt.

38:14.248 --> 38:17.077
- All right, good,
so that case is closed.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.079
Now...

38:19.122 --> 38:21.777
I need to know
your assessment of Rojas.

38:25.912 --> 38:28.262
She went off book twice.

38:28.306 --> 38:31.004
Her instincts were right,
but one day they won't be.

38:31.831 --> 38:34.660
You live by your instincts,
eventually you die by them.

38:34.703 --> 38:36.575
- Or someone else does.

38:36.618 --> 38:39.012
- Exactly.

38:40.840 --> 38:42.494
- So, it's a no?

38:51.590 --> 38:54.332
- So you really did
get burnt with a cigarette.

38:56.812 --> 38:58.945
- Something like that.

39:00.468 --> 39:01.861
You know,

39:01.904 --> 39:03.776
Platt said they
couldn't give me a locker--

39:03.819 --> 39:05.299
said there were some issues.

39:05.343 --> 39:08.041
Pretty sure
that's not a good sign.

39:14.439 --> 39:17.224
- Look, Vanessa.

39:17.267 --> 39:19.748
the way they jammed you
into Intelligence--

39:19.792 --> 39:23.099
they didn't do you any favors.

39:23.143 --> 39:26.015
I was also in deep undercover.

39:26.059 --> 39:28.496
Transition's a bitch.

39:28.540 --> 39:31.369
You live by your lights,
your instincts...

39:31.412 --> 39:34.415
because that's how you survive.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.112
But here?

39:36.156 --> 39:38.201
It's a different game.

39:39.202 --> 39:42.031
It's about teamwork and trust.

39:43.163 --> 39:45.252
And it takes time.

39:49.038 --> 39:51.214
- I get it.

39:53.565 --> 39:55.349
Thank you.

39:55.393 --> 39:58.526
I hope we can stay
in touch, if that's cool.

39:58.570 --> 40:01.442
- Yeah, we'll keep in touch.

40:01.486 --> 40:03.879
We're gonna
be working together.

40:05.359 --> 40:08.362
- What are you talking about?
- You're in.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.885
- I'm in?

40:09.929 --> 40:12.453
- Yeah, Voight just
signed off on you.

40:16.239 --> 40:19.025
We just have one final hurdle.

40:19.068 --> 40:21.114
Platt says you didn't
fill out your address.

40:21.157 --> 40:23.551
- No, I'll--I'll do that.

40:26.902 --> 40:30.036
- You don't have
an address, do you?

40:33.561 --> 40:35.650
- Not yet.

40:35.694 --> 40:39.262
They pulled me out
of my undercover apartment.

40:39.306 --> 40:42.265
I just haven't had time
to look for a new place.

40:46.618 --> 40:48.402
- Honestly, with this job,

40:48.446 --> 40:51.579
you're not gonna have any
free time any time soon, so...

40:53.712 --> 40:56.062
Why don't you stay with me?

40:56.105 --> 40:57.890
- You mean that?

40:57.933 --> 41:01.415
- Yeah, we'll work it out.

41:03.939 --> 41:05.463
Let's go.
