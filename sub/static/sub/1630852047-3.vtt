00:08.843 --> 00:11.053
but the next one will save it.

00:11.137 --> 00:13.597
[Moiraine] Forget what you've
heard about the Dragon.

00:13.681 --> 00:16.392
This power,
it's meant for women.

00:16.475 --> 00:18.811
- And women alone.
- [screams]

00:18.894 --> 00:20.855
[Moiraine] You see,
women all over the world

00:20.938 --> 00:22.356
have different names for it.

00:22.440 --> 00:23.899
But it's one power.

00:23.983 --> 00:25.943
You don't listen to the wind,
Egwene.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.362
It's the wind
that listens to you.

00:28.446 --> 00:30.614
- [shouting]
- [grunts]

00:32.283 --> 00:34.577
[Egwene] Don't you see how pale
she's getting? How weak?

00:34.660 --> 00:35.953
- [roars]
- [screaming]
- [Egwene] Nynaeve!

00:36.036 --> 00:37.288
[Egwene] Those monsters
killed Nynaeve and Laila

00:37.371 --> 00:40.166
and half the people
we've ever loved.

00:40.207 --> 00:43.961
You're going to be just like
your dad. Damn prick

00:44.044 --> 00:45.379
like him.

00:46.797 --> 00:50.259
What in Light's name?
Go! I'll find you.

00:50.342 --> 00:52.178
No, we-we can't
leave without them.

00:52.261 --> 00:54.096
[Mat] Pretty sure we can.

00:55.181 --> 00:56.849
- Rand!
- Mat!

00:57.767 --> 01:00.853
If you don't
take me to them right now,

01:00.936 --> 01:02.438
I'll slit your throat.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.067
[muffled, distorted screaming]

01:17.203 --> 01:18.579
[Egwene] Nynaeve!

01:18.662 --> 01:21.582
- [screaming]
- Nynaeve!

01:24.210 --> 01:25.920
Nynaeve!

[panting]

04:29.895 --> 04:32.481
[grunts, panting]

06:09.620 --> 06:11.163
Where are my friends?

06:11.246 --> 06:13.332
Are they alive?

06:16.043 --> 06:17.586
I won't ask again.

06:17.669 --> 06:19.254
They're not here.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.382
How did you find me?

06:26.553 --> 06:28.472
What did she do to them?

06:30.474 --> 06:32.851
You think you know this world.

06:34.186 --> 06:36.105
You know nothing.

06:36.188 --> 06:39.191
The Dark One
is coming for your friends.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.486
And Moiraine has fought his
forces with everything she has.

06:42.569 --> 06:45.072
If she cares about them so much,
then why did she leave them?

06:45.155 --> 06:46.990
She didn't.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.701
I did.

06:54.039 --> 06:57.376
She can't move...

06:57.459 --> 06:59.837
let alone find them
in her condition.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.465
You're a healer.

07:03.549 --> 07:05.551
You think I'm gonna help her?

07:05.634 --> 07:08.262
You will if you want
to help your friends.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.646
Don't move.

07:21.525 --> 07:24.027
We both know

07:24.111 --> 07:25.737
that you won't.

07:25.821 --> 07:27.156
[grunting]

07:27.239 --> 07:29.658
Ooh, you actually tried
to kill me.

07:29.741 --> 07:30.993
Let go of me.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.536
- [grunting]
- [groaning]

07:32.619 --> 07:33.912
[grunting]

07:37.082 --> 07:39.418
[Rand] [echoing] Egwene!

07:40.419 --> 07:42.546
Perrin!

07:46.925 --> 07:48.385
Egwene!

07:49.678 --> 07:51.221
Perrin!

07:52.222 --> 07:53.807
Can you see them?

07:53.891 --> 07:55.058
If they made it out
of the city...

07:55.142 --> 07:56.810
They made it.

07:56.894 --> 07:58.395
- Egwene!
- Look, Rand, Rand, Rand,

07:58.478 --> 07:59.563
we're gonna find them.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.065
We will. Promise you.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.484
But we're gonna be no help to
them if we get ourselves killed.

08:04.568 --> 08:05.777
All right?

08:05.861 --> 08:08.238
Who knows what's out there
that can hear us?

08:08.322 --> 08:11.742
Let's find a way home. Yeah?

08:11.825 --> 08:12.868
And if we find them
along the way...

08:12.951 --> 08:15.162
They're not going back home.

08:15.245 --> 08:18.582
Moiraine said the Trollocs
would come back if we did.

08:18.665 --> 08:21.919
She said we need to go
to the White Tower.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.005
And you believe Moiraine?

08:26.924 --> 08:28.926
Egwene does.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.930
And what do you want us to do?

08:33.013 --> 08:35.766
Just walk to the White Tower?

08:35.849 --> 08:36.850
How we gonna get there?

08:36.934 --> 08:38.644
They say all roads lead there.

08:38.727 --> 08:40.354
That's not how roads work.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.607
It's east.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.359
We know that.

08:47.819 --> 08:48.987
Come on, Rand.

08:49.071 --> 08:51.448
Last thing you ever wanted to do
was leave home.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.784
We both know that.

08:56.411 --> 08:58.789
It won't be home without them.

09:04.503 --> 09:05.837
[sniffs]

09:17.432 --> 09:19.434
[wind howling]

[grunting, panting]

09:31.571 --> 09:33.657
[wolf howls]

09:33.740 --> 09:35.659
[Egwene] Those wolves,

09:35.742 --> 09:37.536
I think they're following us!

09:37.619 --> 09:38.537
There.

09:38.620 --> 09:39.871
[Perrin] Keep going! Come on.

09:39.955 --> 09:42.082
Let's light a fire.
It'll keep them back.

09:42.165 --> 09:43.083
[grunts]

09:43.166 --> 09:44.626
[barking in distance]

09:57.681 --> 09:58.890
[groans]

09:58.974 --> 10:01.018
I'm sorry. I'll get it.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.894
[grunting]

10:02.978 --> 10:04.730
Don't worry. I'll get it.

10:04.813 --> 10:06.898
[straining]

10:06.982 --> 10:08.942
Come on. Come on. Come on.

10:09.026 --> 10:11.320
[grunting, panting]

10:13.322 --> 10:15.282

10:29.129 --> 10:31.131

10:39.514 --> 10:40.932
Was that me or you?

10:41.016 --> 10:43.018
[chuckles softly]

10:43.101 --> 10:45.520
If you wouldn't mind channeling
us some food or water...

10:45.604 --> 10:47.105
[both chuckle softly]

10:47.189 --> 10:49.191
[howling in distance]

10:56.531 --> 10:58.867
Do you think they're all right?

10:58.950 --> 11:01.244
[sniffs] I don't know.

11:03.955 --> 11:06.291
But I know
where Rand will be headed.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.211
Back home.

11:11.922 --> 11:13.173
We can't go back.

11:13.256 --> 11:16.259
- We have to.
- We can't.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.512
And they won't either.

11:18.595 --> 11:21.139
And how do you know?

11:22.682 --> 11:24.851
Because I know Rand.

11:25.852 --> 11:29.022
He'll go where he thinks
you're going.

11:29.106 --> 11:30.524
- [shudders]
- Come here.

11:30.607 --> 11:31.858
I'll keep watch.

11:31.942 --> 11:34.486
You get warm, get some rest.

11:34.569 --> 11:36.947

12:37.883 --> 12:40.302
Are you ready to help now?

12:41.511 --> 12:43.472
If I help her,

12:43.555 --> 12:46.057
she best give me
the answers I want.

12:47.350 --> 12:49.603
Are you really in a position
to be making demands?

12:49.686 --> 12:51.813
It's not a demand,
it's a threat.

12:55.901 --> 12:58.236
She's gonna die
without treatment.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.197
You know that.

13:02.073 --> 13:05.035
I don't see another Wisdom
around here.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.828
Do you?

13:08.413 --> 13:10.123
[exhales]

13:23.762 --> 13:25.889
You don't have to stand there
like that.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.974
I'm not gonna run off.

13:30.268 --> 13:31.770
Fine.

13:51.081 --> 13:53.291
You want to ask, so just ask.

14:01.132 --> 14:02.717
You said you tracked me.

14:04.302 --> 14:07.013
All the way from the Two Rivers
to Shadar Logoth.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.724
How?

14:15.605 --> 14:18.191
Said you could ask,
not that I'd answer.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.778
All right, I'm ready.

14:49.639 --> 14:50.807
I've heard about the bond

14:50.890 --> 14:53.226
between an Aes Sedai
and her Warder,

14:53.310 --> 14:55.562
that you feel what she feels.

14:59.399 --> 15:02.652
So get ready,
because this is going to hurt.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.660
[Moiraine groaning]

15:42.359 --> 15:44.361

18:10.715 --> 18:12.592
Why have they stopped?

18:12.675 --> 18:15.011
We have to keep moving. Come on.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.179
Egwene.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.681
[wolves howling]

18:18.765 --> 18:20.767
[panting]

18:35.698 --> 18:37.700
- [birds singing]
- [wind blowing]

18:41.371 --> 18:43.206
Shit, it's cold.

18:45.333 --> 18:48.545
How about we, uh... trade coats?

18:49.546 --> 18:51.589
Come on.

18:51.673 --> 18:54.926
Think of the kids who'll read
stories about you someday.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.263
Mat Cauthon,

18:58.346 --> 19:01.182
the man who once walked
while a little chilly.

19:02.225 --> 19:03.726
You funny now?

19:03.810 --> 19:05.478
[panting]

19:05.562 --> 19:07.522
That's a new wrinkle.

19:07.605 --> 19:11.734
Let's at least start going
downhill instead of up, eh?

19:11.818 --> 19:14.112
Eh?

19:14.195 --> 19:16.573
- [panting]
- [clacking in distance]

19:17.782 --> 19:19.617
What's that, then?

19:19.701 --> 19:21.286
Downhill.

19:22.537 --> 19:23.621
[chuckles softly]

19:38.595 --> 19:40.930
Well, this seems
like a friendly place.

19:41.014 --> 19:43.099
Nice way to welcome people.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.102
So you'll be
on best behavior, then.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.730
[cage creaking]

19:56.404 --> 19:57.822
Come on.

20:02.076 --> 20:05.788
[Mat] Wonder why we never had
one of these in Two Rivers.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.457
Charming, really.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.217
[clacking]

20:25.516 --> 20:27.518
- [horse neighs]
- [indistinct chatter]

20:30.146 --> 20:33.107
- [creaking]
- [horse neighs]

20:36.486 --> 20:38.446
- [jangling]
- [man shouts]

20:44.494 --> 20:47.497
[cheering]

20:58.424 --> 21:00.927
[lively chatter and laughter]

21:04.722 --> 21:06.641
[group] Drink! Drink! Drink!

21:06.724 --> 21:07.892
[cheering]

21:10.812 --> 21:12.730
- Welcome, gents.
- [coins clinking]

21:12.814 --> 21:14.816
[chatter, laughter]

21:23.574 --> 21:26.953
We've only got enough for food.

21:27.036 --> 21:28.997
- [Dana] Soup's good today.
- Yeah.

21:30.039 --> 21:32.375
Has anyone else
come into town today?

21:32.458 --> 21:33.418
Our age.

21:33.501 --> 21:35.586
A woman with a braid
or a big man.

21:35.670 --> 21:36.921
A blacksmith.

21:37.005 --> 21:39.799
No, the only other fresh one
in town's a gleeman.

21:39.882 --> 21:41.384
Best quiet down.
He's about to do another song.

21:41.467 --> 21:42.802
[laughter]

21:42.885 --> 21:44.887
[floor creaking]

21:46.305 --> 21:48.641
Shh, quiet.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.653
[tuning]

23:58.271 --> 24:01.774
[clanging in distance]

24:03.192 --> 24:04.193
[guitar thumps]

24:04.277 --> 24:06.362
All right, we all gonna cry?

24:06.445 --> 24:08.489
Or do we want another round?

24:08.573 --> 24:10.950
[cheering]

24:11.033 --> 24:13.119
Oh, sorry. [grunts]

24:13.202 --> 24:14.370
Yeah, don't worry, mate.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.789
- That's for you.
- Thank you, thank you.

24:16.873 --> 24:17.790
[grunts]

24:17.874 --> 24:18.875
[chuckles softly]

24:20.835 --> 24:21.878
Donation for the gleeman?

24:21.961 --> 24:24.589
Too depressed for charity,
I'm afraid.

24:24.672 --> 24:27.425
But if you two think
you can do better,

24:27.508 --> 24:29.260
go on, then.

24:30.303 --> 24:32.638
Don't let him bait you. [grunts]

24:32.722 --> 24:35.725
Anyone but him here sings
ends up in the lake.

24:37.101 --> 24:38.436
That'll be three coppers.

24:38.519 --> 24:39.770
We didn't order that beer
for him.

24:39.854 --> 24:40.980
Donation for the gleeman.

24:41.063 --> 24:42.732
It's all right.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.614
[sighs]

24:54.994 --> 24:57.038
You cannot trust anyone in here.

24:58.539 --> 25:00.499
- [coins clink]
- Come on.

25:02.418 --> 25:04.795
Donation for the gleeman.

25:04.879 --> 25:06.464
And a small fee
for the life lesson.

25:06.547 --> 25:08.216
Bloody expensive lesson.

25:08.299 --> 25:10.051
The best ones are.

25:10.134 --> 25:11.552
[chuckles softly]

25:14.931 --> 25:16.724
Come on.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.603
- [door opens]
- Sit down.

25:22.563 --> 25:24.732
[door closes]

25:24.815 --> 25:26.817
[wind blowing]

25:33.616 --> 25:35.618
[wolves howling]

25:42.083 --> 25:44.085
[barking in distance]

25:45.836 --> 25:47.171
[howling]

25:47.255 --> 25:49.632
[Egwene] They're still there.

25:56.931 --> 25:58.099
Look.

25:58.182 --> 26:00.518
Fresh tracks.

26:00.601 --> 26:02.144
And deep.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.735
And carrying lots of people.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.530
Who do you think they could be?

26:12.613 --> 26:14.448
I... don't know.

26:14.532 --> 26:15.950
Traders?

26:17.743 --> 26:19.328
Maybe Whitecloaks.

26:20.371 --> 26:21.998
[inhales sharply]

26:24.000 --> 26:25.334
Well, whoever they are...

26:26.919 --> 26:29.755
...they've headed east,
towards the White Tower.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.759
The wolves, Perrin.

26:33.843 --> 26:37.305
It's almost like they,
they led us here.

26:40.474 --> 26:44.020
We should stay well back until
we know who we're following.

26:54.864 --> 26:56.866
[wind blowing]

27:03.706 --> 27:05.041
[lively chatter]

27:05.124 --> 27:07.043
Have we got enough money
to pay for tonight?

27:07.126 --> 27:09.128
I have. You got robbed.

27:10.379 --> 27:13.883
Come on. Let's see if
that barmaid has a room for us.

27:15.217 --> 27:16.719
Come on.

27:25.269 --> 27:26.812
All right, out with it, then.

27:26.896 --> 27:28.898
I can tell
when a lad wants something.

27:32.526 --> 27:33.986
[grunting]

27:35.821 --> 27:38.324
- My friend and I
find ourselves in...
- [sniffing]

27:38.407 --> 27:40.951
...dire financial straits
and in need of a place to sleep,

27:41.035 --> 27:42.036
just for the night.

27:43.079 --> 27:46.248
We throw ourselves at the feet
of your mercy

27:46.332 --> 27:47.750
and charity.

27:48.876 --> 27:50.669
[Dana] Go on, then.

27:51.921 --> 27:52.963
[chuckles softly]

27:53.047 --> 27:55.216
Uh, we're looking
for somewhere cheap,

27:55.299 --> 27:56.801
even if it's just a tarp.

27:56.884 --> 27:59.595
We have some money
or we can work for it.

28:00.596 --> 28:02.014
Save your money.

28:02.098 --> 28:04.475
Light knows I need the help.
[exhales]

28:07.937 --> 28:09.230
Come on.

28:09.313 --> 28:11.774
- [dogs barking]
- [chickens clucking]

28:11.857 --> 28:14.819
Start by splitting all that.
[grunts]

28:14.902 --> 28:17.863
I'm sure two strong lads
like you can manage.

28:25.329 --> 28:26.622
[dogs barking]

28:26.705 --> 28:29.333
Isn't she a bit...
young for you?

28:29.417 --> 28:31.752
Thought Moiraine
was more your speed.

28:31.836 --> 28:33.838
I make exceptions.

28:33.921 --> 28:35.172
Come on.

28:35.256 --> 28:37.133
We'll take turns.

28:39.009 --> 28:40.761
Do you think she's up for it?

28:40.845 --> 28:42.388
The wood, Mat.

28:42.471 --> 28:43.806
We'll alternate.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.850
[sniffs]

28:47.143 --> 28:51.480
To be fair, you are the one
who said we'd do this.

28:53.607 --> 28:57.027
And you're the reason we're
in this shit town to begin with.

28:57.111 --> 28:58.654
What's going on with you?

28:58.737 --> 29:00.322
Nothing.

29:02.908 --> 29:05.411
This is the least of what we're
going to have to do to make it

29:05.494 --> 29:07.371
- to the White Tower.
- [chuckles]

29:07.455 --> 29:09.540
You think this will be easy?

29:11.542 --> 29:14.378
You're serious, aren't you?

29:15.463 --> 29:16.714
What do you mean?

29:16.797 --> 29:18.215
- About all this shite.
- What are you on about?

29:18.299 --> 29:20.384
Oh, come on, Rand. Aes Sedai?

29:20.468 --> 29:23.721
White Tower? One of us
being the Dragon Reborn?

29:23.804 --> 29:25.097
It's a bloody joke.

29:25.181 --> 29:27.683
And the worst kind,
one that's gone on way too long.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.060
Egwene and Perrin aren't going
to the White Tower.

29:30.144 --> 29:31.812
They're probably dead.

29:38.736 --> 29:40.571
You don't believe that.

29:44.158 --> 29:47.244
Even if they aren't...

29:47.328 --> 29:49.830
you don't need to go there
for her.

29:50.915 --> 29:53.250
She wouldn't do it for you.

29:57.087 --> 29:59.715
You are such a prick.

30:01.383 --> 30:03.177
Go on, then.

30:03.260 --> 30:04.178
I'll handle this.

30:04.261 --> 30:06.889
You do whatever you want,
like always.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.854
[grunts]

30:17.858 --> 30:20.528
- [chatter, laughter]
- [clears throat]

30:20.611 --> 30:21.737
[Dana] Finished already?

30:21.820 --> 30:23.239
Rand's a woodsman.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.157
More than capable himself.

30:25.241 --> 30:27.117
Thought it might be best
if we split our efforts.

30:27.201 --> 30:30.037
Something tells me
your efforts aren't worth much.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.830
Depends entirely
on the exercise.

30:31.914 --> 30:33.123
Huh. Latrine cleaning?

30:33.207 --> 30:34.750
[chuckles]

30:34.833 --> 30:36.168
[inhales] No.

30:36.252 --> 30:37.670
Washing sheets?

30:37.753 --> 30:39.421
Mm, prefer to sleep in them.

30:39.505 --> 30:40.673
- I've got an idea.
- Mm-hmm.

30:40.756 --> 30:42.466
Why don't you tell me
what you can do

30:42.550 --> 30:43.801
and I'll see
if I can find you something.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.179
[sucks teeth] Well...

30:47.263 --> 30:50.140
back home, I was, uh,
pretty well-off.

30:50.224 --> 30:51.225
Horse trader.

30:51.308 --> 30:53.561
Thank goodness you're here.

30:53.644 --> 30:54.812
Everybody!

30:54.895 --> 30:58.857
Everybody, I have a horse trader
with no horses here.

30:58.941 --> 31:01.318
- [quietly] All right.
- Does anyone need
a horse trader

31:01.402 --> 31:03.070
with no horses?

31:03.153 --> 31:04.780
[jeering, laughter]

31:04.863 --> 31:06.156
No one cares about anything

31:06.240 --> 31:07.658
other than when
the next beer's coming.

31:07.741 --> 31:08.909
So it's your choice:

31:08.993 --> 31:11.537
serve beer or chop wood.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.247
I'm usually the one drinking.

31:13.330 --> 31:14.331
[gasps]

31:16.208 --> 31:18.252
Then you'll know how pissed off
people get waiting for one.

31:18.335 --> 31:20.671
[shouting, laughter]

31:20.754 --> 31:22.756
Come on. What you waiting for?

31:22.840 --> 31:24.800
[man] Come on!

31:24.883 --> 31:26.885
[cheering]

31:29.096 --> 31:31.015
[chuckles] Too pretty
for the mines, were we?

31:31.098 --> 31:32.433
Barmaid with stubble.

31:32.516 --> 31:34.184
Blunted my razor
shaving your wife's back.

31:34.268 --> 31:35.394
[laughing]

31:35.477 --> 31:37.396
[patron] [laughs]
Hey, Dana, who is this?

31:37.479 --> 31:38.564
Where'd you find him?

31:38.647 --> 31:40.065
I don't know. He just showed up.

31:40.149 --> 31:41.859
- Might keep him around, though.
- [coins clinking]

31:42.860 --> 31:44.570
He amuses.

31:47.489 --> 31:48.699
They tipped you.

31:48.782 --> 31:50.200
[chuckles softly]

31:51.201 --> 31:53.037
Saving up for something nice?

31:53.120 --> 31:54.705
Just trying to get home.

31:54.788 --> 31:56.290
And here's me thinking
this was the spot

31:56.373 --> 31:57.791
you'd always dreamed of.

31:58.792 --> 32:00.336
Shame.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.504
Breen's Spring ain't
exactly the place to find a man

32:02.588 --> 32:04.715
who can string
an entire sentence together.

32:04.798 --> 32:06.592
[both chuckle]

32:06.675 --> 32:08.802
So, where's home?

32:08.886 --> 32:12.222
The Two... of us are
from Baerlon.

32:12.306 --> 32:13.891
Back west.

32:13.974 --> 32:16.602
You don't know the quickest way
to get back?

32:16.685 --> 32:18.437
Riverboat. [grunts softly]

32:18.520 --> 32:20.105
But you'll need more tips
than that.

32:20.189 --> 32:21.106
How much more?

32:21.190 --> 32:22.650
A few hundred tables more.

32:22.733 --> 32:25.152
Double if your friend's going
with you.

32:27.071 --> 32:29.573
I'm only gonna need one ticket.

32:30.991 --> 32:33.327
Bit of a shame
you're headed home.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.913
I like the fact you got out.

32:37.164 --> 32:38.999
Here, we're born in this dirt,

32:39.083 --> 32:41.210
spend our lives digging in it,

32:41.293 --> 32:42.503
until, one day, they cover us up

32:42.586 --> 32:45.506
with a few shovelfuls
of the same stuff.

32:45.589 --> 32:48.258
And all these bastards know
everything about me.

32:48.342 --> 32:51.345
The ones that stuck around have
known me since I was a girl.

32:54.014 --> 32:56.016
But someplace new,

32:56.100 --> 32:59.645
someplace new
you can be whatever you want.

32:59.728 --> 33:02.940
No one's gonna know
the dirt you were born in.

33:09.446 --> 33:11.365
I've got people who need me.

33:11.448 --> 33:14.535
So I'm gonna get back, somehow.

33:14.618 --> 33:16.704
Whether I need to beg,
borrow or steal.

33:16.787 --> 33:18.831
I'd think about that last one,

33:18.914 --> 33:21.125
unless you want to end up
in a cage.

33:23.961 --> 33:25.963
[birds singing]

33:28.298 --> 33:29.383
[breathing shallowly]

33:29.466 --> 33:31.885
[Nynaeve] The poison...

33:31.969 --> 33:33.804
it's not like anything
I've seen before.

33:33.887 --> 33:34.888
[Moiraine whimpers]

33:34.972 --> 33:36.473
I worry it...

33:42.229 --> 33:43.230
I'll be back.

33:44.982 --> 33:46.608
Where are you going?

33:46.692 --> 33:49.236
What happened
to watching my every move?

33:49.319 --> 33:51.071
You'll keep her safe.

33:51.155 --> 33:52.406
You need to.

33:54.700 --> 33:55.909
[horse snorts]

33:57.870 --> 33:59.496
Don't be so sure.

33:59.580 --> 34:01.290
- [clicks tongue]
- [horse snorting]

34:01.373 --> 34:02.291
Hah.

34:02.374 --> 34:03.709
[horse neighs]

34:03.792 --> 34:05.794
Hyah! Hyah!

34:11.341 --> 34:13.343
[panting softly]

34:16.054 --> 34:17.473
[Perrin exhales]

34:19.099 --> 34:21.351
We won't be able to see
too far ahead in there.

34:30.611 --> 34:32.488
Let me go first.

34:34.198 --> 34:36.408
I'll come back for you
if it's safe.

34:36.492 --> 34:39.536
No. We go together
or we don't go at all.

34:39.620 --> 34:41.163
No, I'm just going to see.

34:41.246 --> 34:43.499
I'll just see who it is.

34:43.582 --> 34:45.667
You don't have to protect me,
Perrin.

34:46.752 --> 34:48.587
All right?

34:51.924 --> 34:54.051
It's not your fault...

34:54.134 --> 34:55.469
what happened.

34:57.262 --> 34:58.931
[quietly] It is.

34:59.014 --> 35:00.557
It's not.

35:05.062 --> 35:06.563
It's not your fault.

35:06.647 --> 35:08.649
[crying softly]

35:20.828 --> 35:22.496
Come on.

35:22.579 --> 35:24.331
Let's go.

35:29.419 --> 35:31.171
[bird screeches]

35:38.804 --> 35:41.390
[rustling]

35:41.473 --> 35:43.934
[cracking]

35:44.017 --> 35:45.143
[muffled] Perrin.

35:45.227 --> 35:47.062
- Perrin, what is it?
- [howling]

35:47.145 --> 35:48.564
- [barking, howling]
- [exhales sharply]

35:48.647 --> 35:51.316
What do you want?

35:51.400 --> 35:53.318
[man] Do you know the song?

35:54.403 --> 35:56.154
Do you know the song?

36:01.326 --> 36:02.870
What?

36:06.415 --> 36:08.458
[dog whining]

36:08.542 --> 36:11.461
They don't know it
or they'd have answered.

36:12.754 --> 36:15.007
"Your welcome warms our spirit

36:15.090 --> 36:17.175
as your fires warm the flesh,

36:17.259 --> 36:19.261
but we do not know the song."

36:20.679 --> 36:22.598
That's the important bit.

36:22.681 --> 36:23.807
Go on.

36:23.891 --> 36:25.309
Say it.

36:27.853 --> 36:30.689
"Y-Your welcome warms our...

36:30.772 --> 36:35.110
our spirit as your fire
warms the flesh, but...

36:35.193 --> 36:37.362
w-we do not know the song."

36:42.576 --> 36:44.912
We-we don't know the song.

36:47.164 --> 36:48.498
Satisfied?

36:48.582 --> 36:50.292
"Then we seek still.

36:50.375 --> 36:52.711
As it was, so shall it be,

36:52.794 --> 36:56.590
if we but remember,
seek and find."

36:57.966 --> 36:59.134
I'm Ila.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.969
This is Raen.

37:01.053 --> 37:02.554
You both look awful.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.227
- [horses neighing]
- [indistinct chatter]

37:10.687 --> 37:12.689
[children laughing]

37:18.904 --> 37:20.322
Please.

37:38.340 --> 37:39.925
Who are you?

37:40.008 --> 37:41.134
[children squealing]

37:41.218 --> 37:43.053
Come on, now.

37:43.136 --> 37:45.764
Our reputation precedes us,
wherever we go.

37:45.847 --> 37:48.183
Ill-earned, that reputation.

37:49.393 --> 37:51.144
We're the Tuatha'an,

37:51.228 --> 37:52.479
the Traveling People.

37:52.562 --> 37:54.898
The people who steal
your gold and your children.

37:54.982 --> 37:56.483
Aram.

37:57.776 --> 38:00.028
Surely you've heard
of the Tinkers?

38:02.239 --> 38:04.992
Our fires are open to all,

38:05.075 --> 38:06.576
for as long as you need them.

38:06.660 --> 38:08.245
And you two,

38:08.328 --> 38:10.664
you look like you need them.

38:24.136 --> 38:25.721
[grunts]

38:25.804 --> 38:27.806
[panting softly]

38:32.561 --> 38:33.979
[exhales]

38:34.062 --> 38:34.980
[dogs barking in distance]

38:35.063 --> 38:37.482
[panting]

38:37.566 --> 38:39.693
I let your friend off
an hour ago.

38:39.776 --> 38:41.194
Figured he'd join you.

38:41.278 --> 38:43.989
Not until all the work's done,
I'm sure.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.283
That's plenty for now.

38:46.366 --> 38:47.701
And the next year, probably.

38:48.785 --> 38:52.372
So, it's all right
if we stay out here?

38:55.000 --> 38:56.251
I'll do you one better.

38:56.334 --> 38:57.335
Come on.

38:57.419 --> 38:59.421
[cheering in distance]

39:00.797 --> 39:01.715
[Rand] Honestly,

39:01.798 --> 39:04.718
we'll be fine under the tarps.

39:04.801 --> 39:06.762
You could fill this
with another paying customer.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.764
Do you think
I see any of that coin?

39:08.847 --> 39:10.515
No, you and Mat... [grunts]

39:10.599 --> 39:12.267
...you earned a real roof.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.102
And this will give you
plenty of privacy.

39:14.186 --> 39:15.979
You can be as loud as you want,

39:16.063 --> 39:18.065
and no one will hear a thing.

39:19.066 --> 39:20.525
Nothing like a bit
of slap and tickle

39:20.609 --> 39:22.444
to sort out relationship woes.

39:22.527 --> 39:24.863
[chuckles] Mat and I,
we're not...

39:24.946 --> 39:26.907
Sorry. It's none of my business
what a man decides to do

39:26.990 --> 39:28.784
with his...
I'll keep my gob shut.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.494
- We're not together.
- You sure?

39:30.577 --> 39:32.662
Well, things seem pretty tense

39:32.746 --> 39:34.456
- for friends.
- Yeah, if I wanted a man,

39:34.539 --> 39:35.540
I could do better.

39:35.624 --> 39:37.667
[chuckles] I didn't know.

39:37.751 --> 39:39.461
I can't tell.

39:41.213 --> 39:42.714
These beers are on the house
for you both,

39:42.798 --> 39:43.715
whatever you are.

39:43.799 --> 39:44.925
Well, have his.

39:45.008 --> 39:46.510
He's done bugger all.

39:47.552 --> 39:48.720
Unless you're working.

39:48.804 --> 39:49.971
Oh.

39:50.055 --> 39:51.473
If you don't think
I drink on the job,

39:51.556 --> 39:53.350
then you
have sorely misjudged me.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.394
[rapid hoofbeats]

S... [exhales]

40:38.270 --> 40:39.855
I found what we're looking for.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.731
Can she ride?

40:42.732 --> 40:45.318
[Nynaeve] The poultice will give
her energy for a few hours,

40:45.402 --> 40:46.403
maybe more.

40:46.486 --> 40:47.988
- But after that...

[dog barking in distance]

41:27.611 --> 41:29.029
[gleeman] What are you doing,
boy?

41:32.115 --> 41:34.034
Could ask the same of you,

41:34.117 --> 41:35.410
old man.

41:39.915 --> 41:42.042
Don't want to hurt you.

41:42.125 --> 41:43.710
You'll bleed out

41:43.793 --> 41:45.962
before you could lay a finger
on me.

41:47.047 --> 41:50.467
I've not survived Trollocs
to die at the hands of a singer.

41:51.843 --> 41:53.970
I'm not here for you.

41:54.054 --> 41:56.056
I'm here to bury him.

42:00.810 --> 42:04.814
What kind of farm boy from the
Two Rivers has met a Trolloc?

42:07.776 --> 42:09.694
Who says
I'm from the Two Rivers?

42:09.778 --> 42:11.696
It's written all over you.

42:11.780 --> 42:13.698
Your speech, your dress,

42:13.782 --> 42:16.785
your asinine attitude.

42:16.868 --> 42:18.954
Stubborn as a mule.

42:20.330 --> 42:21.998
Come.

42:22.082 --> 42:24.292
Help me get him down.

42:29.881 --> 42:31.383
[Mat] What'd he do?

42:31.466 --> 42:33.677
This wasn't justice.

42:34.844 --> 42:37.931
I heard them, in town,
bragging about killing an Aiel.

42:40.517 --> 42:41.851
He's an Aiel?

42:41.935 --> 42:44.479
Aren't many things
outside accent and dress

42:44.562 --> 42:47.023
that can tell you
where a person's from.

42:47.107 --> 42:49.067
But it is rare
to see that color of hair

42:49.150 --> 42:51.278
outside the Aiel Waste.

42:53.697 --> 42:55.532
Stories say
they're as bad as Trollocs.

42:55.615 --> 42:56.825
Mine don't.

42:56.908 --> 42:58.994
They're fighters, yes,

42:59.077 --> 43:00.996
but they're honor-bound ones.

43:02.038 --> 43:03.623
You see,

43:03.707 --> 43:07.585
it's only when they're veiled
you should worry.

43:07.669 --> 43:10.088
That's when you're as good
as dead.

43:10.171 --> 43:11.506
Now, he...

43:11.589 --> 43:13.591
was no threat.

43:14.592 --> 43:17.012
He was murdered by cowards

43:17.095 --> 43:19.556
who feared something
they didn't understand.

43:26.896 --> 43:29.316
This is the last time
I'll ask you.

43:29.399 --> 43:31.818
What are you doing here?

43:34.112 --> 43:36.531
Need money...

43:36.614 --> 43:38.283
to get home.

43:38.366 --> 43:39.951
[sniffs]

43:40.035 --> 43:42.037
Thought he might have some.

43:45.206 --> 43:47.542
Not like he needs it.

43:52.213 --> 43:54.382
We've all had desperate moments.

43:56.051 --> 43:57.469
Tell me when you're finished.

44:01.264 --> 44:03.808
[dogs barking in distance]

44:07.270 --> 44:08.646
[grunts softly]

44:11.316 --> 44:13.318
[soft rattling]

44:31.127 --> 44:32.754
I'm sorry.

44:34.506 --> 44:37.425
I've got sisters who need me.

44:39.010 --> 44:40.428
[exhales]

44:45.016 --> 44:46.768
I'm done.

44:48.645 --> 44:50.647
[footsteps approaching]

45:00.698 --> 45:03.451
If you're gonna take
from the dead,

45:03.535 --> 45:05.745
the least you can do
is bury them.

45:11.668 --> 45:13.628
[cheering in distance]

45:13.711 --> 45:16.047
[Dana laughs]

45:16.131 --> 45:17.590
So are you from Baerlon as well?

45:17.674 --> 45:19.259
Scuse me?

45:19.342 --> 45:20.885
Mat said
he's heading back there.

45:20.969 --> 45:22.637
Mat says a lot of things.

45:22.720 --> 45:25.223
- [chuckles]
- Yeah, I'm from, uh, Baerlon.

45:25.306 --> 45:26.516
Why'd you leave?

45:28.143 --> 45:29.477
I needed to get away.

45:29.561 --> 45:30.645
Mat did, too.

45:30.728 --> 45:32.021
Ooh, are you in trouble?

45:32.105 --> 45:33.648
It's complicated.

45:33.731 --> 45:35.942
Then why are you letting him
go back alone, then?

45:36.025 --> 45:37.610
I'm going east.

45:37.694 --> 45:39.320
Where?

45:40.321 --> 45:42.157
[groans] I'm not prying.

45:42.240 --> 45:43.867
Maybe I can help.

45:43.950 --> 45:45.535
I know all the places.
I hear the miners

45:45.618 --> 45:47.829
and the travelers
talk about everywhere.

45:49.581 --> 45:52.083
And here I am, just hearing,
when I want to be seeing.

45:52.167 --> 45:54.252
Seeing what?

45:54.335 --> 45:56.337
[exhales]

45:57.547 --> 45:59.132
Stone of Tear.

46:00.341 --> 46:02.760
The Lion Throne of Caemlyn.

46:02.844 --> 46:04.262
An Ogier Stedding.

46:04.345 --> 46:06.347
Maybe even a Trolloc. [chuckles]

46:06.431 --> 46:08.183
Hmm.

46:10.268 --> 46:11.936
Why don't you?

46:14.772 --> 46:17.275
The Wheel hasn't given me
many choices,

46:17.358 --> 46:20.945
and the ones that I've made
have left me here.

46:25.366 --> 46:27.619
You know what's funny? I...

46:27.702 --> 46:30.997
I never gave much thought
to the Wheel before all this.

46:32.207 --> 46:34.876
I just always done
what I thought was right,

46:34.959 --> 46:38.463
then moved on to the next thing
and tried to do right again.

46:38.546 --> 46:39.964
[chuckles softly]

46:42.175 --> 46:44.594
But now...

46:48.556 --> 46:50.558
...I don't know.

46:52.727 --> 46:54.646
I don't know what's right.

46:55.647 --> 46:57.857
I don't know what to do.

46:59.609 --> 47:01.528
I don't know shit, really.

47:05.865 --> 47:07.534
[chuckles softly]

47:12.455 --> 47:13.373
[chuckles]

47:13.456 --> 47:14.624
I'm sorry. I didn't...

47:14.707 --> 47:15.833
- No, I'm sorry.
- ...didn't mean to...

47:15.917 --> 47:17.502
I came on too strong, didn't I?

47:17.585 --> 47:19.420
- No, it has nothing to do
with you.
- [exhales sharply]

47:19.504 --> 47:20.421
It's just that I...

47:20.505 --> 47:22.090
Was it the hair?

47:24.050 --> 47:25.843
- [door closes, lock clicks]
- What?

47:25.927 --> 47:28.555
No, I shouldn't have braided it.

47:29.847 --> 47:32.100
Makes me look too much like her,
doesn't it?

47:32.183 --> 47:34.477
Like who?

47:36.646 --> 47:37.981
Egwene.

47:43.736 --> 47:45.572
I really like you, Rand.

47:45.655 --> 47:47.490
I think it would be better
if you just got back on the bed.

47:47.574 --> 47:48.658
How do you know her name?

47:48.741 --> 47:50.201
I said get on the bed.

47:51.911 --> 47:53.913
[grunting]

47:53.997 --> 47:54.872
[Rand grunts]

47:54.956 --> 47:56.499
- [grunts]
- [shouts]

47:56.583 --> 47:58.084
[panting]

47:58.167 --> 47:59.419
What are you doing?

47:59.502 --> 48:00.753
Waiting.

48:00.837 --> 48:01.796
For what?

48:01.879 --> 48:02.797
Mat.

48:02.880 --> 48:04.966
I need him, too.

48:10.972 --> 48:13.099
You know, I didn't think
you'd be this sweet.

48:13.182 --> 48:14.434
Makes it harder.

48:15.435 --> 48:17.645
[breathing heavily, shouts]

48:20.356 --> 48:23.443
[gleeman] Rest, warrior
of the Three-fold Land.

48:24.861 --> 48:27.030
May your soul find water

48:27.113 --> 48:28.573
and shade.

48:30.241 --> 48:32.076
What's your name, lad?

48:33.661 --> 48:35.580
Mat Cauthon.

48:37.874 --> 48:39.959
Thom Merrilin.

48:46.507 --> 48:50.094
Now that we're, uh...
acquaintances,

48:50.178 --> 48:52.263
are you gonna give me
my money back?

48:59.187 --> 49:00.605
[coins jangling]

49:00.688 --> 49:02.899
[Thom chuckles]

49:02.982 --> 49:06.110
I see you denied me
the opportunity.

49:07.153 --> 49:09.072
Take care, lad.

49:09.155 --> 49:12.533
Don't let me find you hanging
in a cage someday, huh?

49:24.337 --> 49:25.922
Help! [panting]

49:26.005 --> 49:28.633
Why do you think I brought
you here? That door is made

49:28.716 --> 49:31.552
of ironwood. Three men your size
couldn't break it down.

49:31.636 --> 49:33.513
And like I said,

49:33.596 --> 49:34.972
no one can hear a thing outside.

49:36.015 --> 49:39.185
[grunting]

49:41.979 --> 49:43.189
Rand, come on!

49:43.272 --> 49:46.734
[grunts, panting]

49:46.818 --> 49:48.111
[shouts]

49:49.362 --> 49:50.905
[panting]

49:52.490 --> 49:54.117
[roars]

49:55.076 --> 49:57.203
[panting]

49:57.286 --> 49:58.204
[woman] What is it?

49:58.287 --> 49:59.706
- Mat!
- What? What?

49:59.789 --> 50:02.208
- [pants] She's got my sword!
- What happened?

50:02.291 --> 50:04.961
Run! Go! [panting]

50:05.044 --> 50:07.755
- [grunts]
- Run!
- Come back here!

50:07.839 --> 50:09.340
[man] What's going on out there?

50:09.424 --> 50:11.426
[panting]

50:14.220 --> 50:15.805
Rand! Here!

50:15.888 --> 50:17.557
[woman gasps]

50:19.183 --> 50:20.059
Out of the way!

50:20.143 --> 50:21.769
[grunts]

50:21.853 --> 50:24.313
[panting] This way.

50:24.397 --> 50:25.732
[indistinct shouts]

50:25.815 --> 50:28.109
[grunts]

50:29.652 --> 50:31.821
[Dana panting]

50:34.741 --> 50:36.325
[Mat] Dana.

50:36.409 --> 50:37.994
What are you doing?

50:38.077 --> 50:40.329
I see you.

50:40.413 --> 50:43.166
At night, in my dreams.
All five of you.

50:43.249 --> 50:45.084
But only one of you matters.

50:45.168 --> 50:46.210
Only one of you can be it.

50:46.294 --> 50:48.087
- Five?
- Be what?

50:48.171 --> 50:50.006
The Dragon.

50:53.760 --> 50:55.094
Who are you?

50:55.178 --> 50:57.597
Doesn't matter who I am.

50:57.680 --> 51:00.349
What matters is
who I'm gonna be.

51:00.433 --> 51:02.810
The last time someone brought
the Dragon to the Dark One,

51:02.894 --> 51:06.355
we still remember his name
3,000 years on.

51:06.439 --> 51:08.941
Ishamael.

51:09.025 --> 51:11.444
And to think, of all the people
who serve the Dark,

51:11.527 --> 51:13.112
from fishermen to queens,

51:13.196 --> 51:16.449
it'll be me who brings you
to him this time.

51:16.532 --> 51:18.284
Me.

51:18.367 --> 51:20.495
You'd let the Dark One kill us?

51:20.578 --> 51:21.913
He doesn't want to kill you.

51:21.996 --> 51:24.415
That's what the Aes Sedai want.

51:24.499 --> 51:26.375
He wants you to save us.

51:26.459 --> 51:27.960
Can't you see that?

51:28.044 --> 51:31.047
The Wheel keeps turning,
and people keep hurting.

51:31.130 --> 51:34.967
Every man who comes
to this shite town has a story.

51:35.051 --> 51:38.095
Flood, drought, war,

51:38.179 --> 51:39.597
sisters murdering
their brothers,

51:39.680 --> 51:42.141
children killing their parents.

51:43.810 --> 51:46.479
But the Dragon...

51:46.562 --> 51:49.023
the Dragon has a chance
to change all that.

51:49.106 --> 51:51.192
Break the Wheel.

51:51.275 --> 51:53.361
Make it stop.

51:54.487 --> 51:56.739
We're gonna leave now.

51:58.324 --> 52:00.284
Are you?

52:05.122 --> 52:07.041
I called one of them.

52:07.124 --> 52:09.043
It's already on its way.

52:09.126 --> 52:10.127
What?

52:10.211 --> 52:12.088
- One of what?
- One of what?

52:12.171 --> 52:14.215
One of the Eyeless.

52:17.385 --> 52:19.846
And you can't outrun a Fade.

52:20.847 --> 52:21.848
[grunts]

52:22.640 --> 52:24.976
[choking]

52:29.355 --> 52:30.857
[stammers]

52:32.650 --> 52:33.568
[Rand] You just...

52:33.651 --> 52:35.444
Didn't you hear her?

52:35.528 --> 52:37.280
She's a Darkfriend, boy.

52:37.363 --> 52:39.448
Sworn body and soul
to the Dark One.

52:39.532 --> 52:41.784
If what she said is true,
we need to leave now.

52:41.868 --> 52:43.786
We're not going anywhere
with you.

52:43.870 --> 52:47.748
Suit yourself, if you think the
Fade will be better for company.

52:50.793 --> 52:52.044
Where are you going?

52:53.087 --> 52:54.255
East.

52:54.338 --> 52:56.507
And fast.

52:56.591 --> 52:58.718
Are you coming?

52:58.801 --> 53:01.929
East is good. East is good.

53:44.013 --> 53:47.433
We've been heading southwest
for three hours now.

53:47.516 --> 53:49.101
You care to tell me why?

53:49.185 --> 53:51.354
[horse snorting]

53:51.437 --> 53:54.774
Moiraine, we need you now.

53:56.400 --> 53:57.902
[horse neighs]

54:00.863 --> 54:02.531
[horse neighs in distance]

54:30.142 --> 54:32.144
[horse sputters]

54:32.228 --> 54:34.730
Moiraine Sedai.

54:36.482 --> 54:38.317
Liandrin Sedai.

54:39.318 --> 54:41.654
If you're here to help,
you're too late.

54:43.698 --> 54:46.367
Oh, didn't you hear?

54:47.952 --> 54:50.037
We captured a man
calling himself

54:50.121 --> 54:51.872
the Dragon Reborn.

54:51.956 --> 54:53.457
[rattling]

55:03.509 --> 55:04.844
[horse neighs]
