05:22.229 --> 05:24.190
- You sure it's the Russians?
- 100%, sir.

05:24.398 --> 05:28.652
Submarine launched 12 to 15
megatons. They went to strike status.

05:28.861 --> 05:31.697
The Roosevelt's splashed
six incoming cruise missiles.

05:31.906 --> 05:35.910
The Russians are moving west.
Our Berlin brigade are outnumbered.

05:38.871 --> 05:41.749
Sir, we've got a launch from Alyesk,
Central Russia.

05:41.957 --> 05:44.043
What the hell is in Alyesk?

05:44.251 --> 05:48.881
SS-18 ICBMs. Probable targets:
New York, Washington, here.

05:49.089 --> 05:51.634
- How good is this ceiling?
- Anything but a direct hit.

05:51.842 --> 05:56.138
Satellites confirm birds in the air,
first impact estimated 25 minutes.

05:56.347 --> 05:58.390
- Is that accurate?
- It's accurate.

05:58.599 --> 06:01.769
- I advise we go to DEFCON-1.
- Get President Zorkin on the hotline.

06:01.977 --> 06:05.439
Zorkin is missing. We have reports
of a coup in Moscow.

06:05.648 --> 06:08.484
General Bulgakov
is calling the shots now.

06:08.692 --> 06:10.736
Who the hell is Bulgakov?

06:10.945 --> 06:13.614
The asshole who wanted
to use nukes in Chechnya.

06:28.796 --> 06:31.298
Sir, DEFCON-1. We're out of time.

06:37.179 --> 06:38.472
Do it.

06:40.850 --> 06:42.643
Mr President.

06:42.852 --> 06:47.147
It'll take a minute for the launch
to process after you give the order.

06:47.356 --> 06:50.651
Before the order can be taken,
an ID check must be performed.

06:50.860 --> 06:53.153
My ID number is fifth from the top.

06:57.741 --> 07:00.995
- Sir, it's your wife on 2104.
- Thank you.

07:02.830 --> 07:05.666
- Yeah.
- The order must be confirmed

07:05.875 --> 07:08.836
- by someone on the approved list.
- Shit.

07:09.336 --> 07:11.505
Gene Revell,
National Security Advisor.

07:11.714 --> 07:15.301
Is it black tie? OK. I'm on my way.

07:18.679 --> 07:21.182
Can we...

07:21.390 --> 07:23.392
...finish this up some other time?

07:29.648 --> 07:31.025
No.

07:33.736 --> 07:36.155
We've got to update these fire drills,
Billy.

07:36.363 --> 07:39.450
If the shit ever hits the fan,
I'm not going underground.

07:39.658 --> 07:42.036
It's a goddamn tomb down there.

07:42.244 --> 07:46.207
We have to choose someone else to
face off against besides the Russians.

07:46.415 --> 07:50.961
Really? Let's see. Who else has
27,000 nukes for us to worry about?

07:51.170 --> 07:53.714
It's the guy with one I'm worried about.

07:53.923 --> 07:56.300
I have to send some folks to Russia,

07:56.509 --> 08:00.638
inspect their nuclear decommissioning
facility at Armazas.

08:00.846 --> 08:03.224
- Arzamas.
- Yeah, whatever.

08:03.432 --> 08:07.311
- Someone from your staff should go.
- I'll go.

08:08.103 --> 08:11.941
- Billy, send staff.
- I want to go.

08:12.816 --> 08:14.235
OK.

08:14.443 --> 08:19.573
Don't underestimate Zorkin. Between
his economy, crime, Chechnya...

08:19.782 --> 08:23.118
- His liver.
- What's left of it. How is he?

08:23.327 --> 08:27.748
He's scheduled a press conference
for today, so we know he can sit up.

08:33.837 --> 08:35.464
Chechnya is part of Russia.

08:39.510 --> 08:43.013
Only criminals and their friends
in the West who wish it to be separate.

08:43.222 --> 08:46.600
Mr President, if you will kindly
come back...

08:49.645 --> 08:51.730
Do you guys see what I see?

08:53.107 --> 08:56.193
- His jacket?
- He used to be able to button it up.

08:56.402 --> 08:58.237
He's getting fat.

08:58.445 --> 09:01.824
I know how he feels.
Oh, wow. Look at that.

09:02.032 --> 09:03.659
Maybe it's not the same jacket.

09:03.868 --> 09:07.830
Yeah, it has shiny sleeves. He wore it
the last time he got out of the hospital.

09:08.038 --> 09:11.584
- He's off the diet.
- And off the wagon. He slurred...

09:13.335 --> 09:17.131
That must be why Cherlinski is there,
to keep him off the sauce.

09:17.339 --> 09:18.632
Where's Cherlinski?

09:18.841 --> 09:23.137
Next to... What's her name?
The chick with the brown hair.

09:23.345 --> 09:26.307
- Elena Rishkov.
- That is not Cherlinski.

09:26.891 --> 09:29.268
Bzz! Busted. It's Cherlinski.

09:29.476 --> 09:31.687
You're thinking Cherpitski. It ain't him.

09:31.896 --> 09:34.982
- I know. It's Cherlinski.
- No, it's not. Trust me.

09:35.191 --> 09:39.570
He's next to Elena Rishkov. He was
banging her at the Geneva summit.

09:39.778 --> 09:42.740
Cherlinski was not at Geneva.
Cherpitski was.

09:42.948 --> 09:45.326
Cherpitski was banging Elena Rishkov?

09:46.619 --> 09:51.123
I just said Zorkin's putting on weight.
Why reduce it to sex? It's disgusting.

09:51.332 --> 09:54.627
I agree. Write it up.
If he is putting on weight,

09:54.835 --> 09:59.006
that might have health consequences,
so get it in the afternoon brief.

09:59.673 --> 10:04.345
Oh, and somebody find out who is
banging Elena Rishkov. This is good.

10:08.390 --> 10:13.020
What shall we make of Chechnya
asking the West for protection?

10:13.229 --> 10:18.817
She is like a beautiful virgin, escaping
the clutches of a lecherous bear,

10:19.026 --> 10:22.321
and running to Bill Clinton
to save her maidenhood.

10:24.698 --> 10:29.537
A poet once wrote, "Meet the new
boss, same as the old boss."

10:30.454 --> 10:35.251
He could have been writing of us,
of Europe in the 21 st century.

10:36.961 --> 10:39.547
Over 50 years of America and Russia

10:39.755 --> 10:43.509
imposing their will
on the European community,

10:43.717 --> 10:46.262
East and West,

10:46.470 --> 10:49.765
and we're still treated like children...

10:50.766 --> 10:55.062
...but without the toys
or the goodnight chocolates.

10:55.271 --> 10:57.439
Each day we lose a little bit more

10:57.648 --> 11:02.653
of our separate sovereign ability
to determine our own futures

11:02.862 --> 11:07.241
and each day the world comes just a
little bit closer to that terrible moment

11:07.449 --> 11:12.621
when the beating of a butterfly's wings
unleashes a hurricane...

11:13.289 --> 11:15.875
...God himself cannot stop.

11:51.327 --> 11:52.828
So what is it?

11:54.497 --> 11:55.789
Are you blind?

11:56.123 --> 11:57.416
It's a bomb.

11:58.125 --> 11:59.418
Where's the fuse?

12:09.512 --> 12:10.804
It's warm.

12:11.764 --> 12:14.892
So am I. Come on.
I don't have all night.

12:43.796 --> 12:45.422
It's a dud.

12:46.882 --> 12:48.717
Let's get it on the truck.

12:49.385 --> 12:51.011
But how can we sell it now?

12:51.720 --> 12:54.765
There's always someone
who'll buy this crap.

13:07.027 --> 13:11.115
I cannot stand all these questions
about my health.

13:12.241 --> 13:17.329
I am to be described as
"robust" and "healthy".

13:36.640 --> 13:39.059
Is that yours or mine?

13:40.895 --> 13:44.023
It must be yours. Mine's just for show.

13:52.156 --> 13:54.200
It's not the hospital.

13:56.160 --> 13:58.287
- Hi.
- You're still here.

13:58.954 --> 14:04.210
Well, I think to be accurate,
it's actually you who's still here.

14:06.337 --> 14:08.172
Oh, right.

14:09.632 --> 14:11.509
Not that I'm complaining.

14:16.764 --> 14:18.474
Jack...

14:18.682 --> 14:21.602
I know this is new and all, but...

14:23.646 --> 14:26.273
...I have something I have to say
or I'm going to explode.

14:26.482 --> 14:29.235
I don't want you to be scared.

14:31.654 --> 14:32.947
What?

14:38.202 --> 14:40.287
You're in love with me.

14:47.753 --> 14:51.257
Jack, I'm a medical professional.
I can read the symptoms.

14:51.465 --> 14:53.801
You're definitely in love with me.

14:56.387 --> 14:57.972
And that scares you?

14:59.265 --> 15:01.225
Not even a little.

15:02.810 --> 15:05.271
But I think it scares you.

15:05.479 --> 15:07.898
No, not even a little.

15:11.068 --> 15:14.530
And for the record,
you're the one who brought it up.

15:20.786 --> 15:22.204
Forget it.

15:22.955 --> 15:25.457
- I'm gonna get it.
- No way. It'll stop.

15:28.043 --> 15:30.504
I don't know who this is.

15:33.174 --> 15:35.718
- Just go about your business.
- The timing sucks.

15:35.926 --> 15:38.220
Do what you have to do. I understand.

15:38.429 --> 15:40.514
Yes, this is Dr Muller.

15:41.390 --> 15:43.684
Muller. You paged me.

15:45.978 --> 15:47.271
Hello.

15:47.771 --> 15:50.357
Stop! Yes, this is Jack Ryan.

15:52.735 --> 15:54.153
Jesus.

15:55.154 --> 15:57.531
OK. I'll be there in half an hour.

15:58.574 --> 16:02.578
I gotta go. I have an emergency
at work.

16:02.786 --> 16:04.663
I have to go. I'm sorry.

16:06.290 --> 16:08.667
Cathy, how about dinner tonight?

16:08.876 --> 16:10.294
Yeah.

16:10.503 --> 16:13.881
- How about tomorrow night?
- Jack, I said yes to tonight.

16:14.715 --> 16:16.342
I know.

16:19.720 --> 16:22.723
What kind of emergency
does a historian have?

16:22.932 --> 16:28.646
He died at 0420 Zulu. 81/2 hours
later, they swore in a new president.

16:28.854 --> 16:31.982
- Who is he?
- Alexander Nemerov.

16:32.191 --> 16:35.820
You're kidding. I wrote a paper
about him a year ago.

16:36.028 --> 16:40.199
- I said he could be the next guy.
- I know.

16:40.407 --> 16:42.409
- Nobody read it.
- They're reading it now.

16:42.618 --> 16:44.578
- Who?
- Cabot.

16:44.787 --> 16:47.456
I've been here 14 months.
He doesn't know what I look...

16:51.544 --> 16:55.089
- Are you Ryan?
- Yes, sir.

16:57.967 --> 17:00.970
What is this? "The Paper Chase"?

17:04.306 --> 17:07.643
- Sir, my...
- Come on, we're late.

17:13.816 --> 17:17.236
You're about to breathe air that's way
over your pay grade, so listen.

17:17.444 --> 17:21.949
You'll be asked for advice. Be sure
you know what you're talking about.

17:22.157 --> 17:24.367
Don't be afraid to say you don't know.

17:24.577 --> 17:27.663
Choose your words carefully.
They could become policy.

17:27.872 --> 17:30.583
Hey, you. Give me your coat.

17:30.791 --> 17:33.127
Come on, you'll get it back.

17:38.007 --> 17:39.300
Tie.

17:46.056 --> 17:48.058
So, intelligence committee?

17:49.768 --> 17:54.106
I've watched these on C-SPAN.
Never actually been to one.

17:54.940 --> 17:58.027
You've never watched
one of these on C-SPAN.

18:18.422 --> 18:23.636
Our most important assessment comes
from a source inside the Kremlin.

18:23.844 --> 18:28.057
In his opinion, Nemerov does not owe
his ascension to the military.

18:28.265 --> 18:31.310
Everyone has opinions, Mr Cabot.

18:31.519 --> 18:33.354
I respect that.

18:33.562 --> 18:37.858
This morning, my wife woke up
and said I was old, bald and ugly.

18:39.568 --> 18:41.779
Is that a question, Mr Chairman?

18:43.072 --> 18:45.449
I told her
appearances aren't everything.

18:45.658 --> 18:48.536
- Would you agree?
- I certainly would.

18:48.744 --> 18:52.998
Now, this new fellow, Nezmeroz.
Is that his name?

18:53.749 --> 18:55.960
Nemerov, sir.

18:56.168 --> 19:00.548
Despite what your source says,
we hear that Nezmeroz is a hardliner.

19:00.756 --> 19:02.883
Is he a hardliner?

19:03.092 --> 19:04.385
No.

19:04.593 --> 19:07.346
It's too soon to make that assessment.

19:07.555 --> 19:09.181
According to CNN,

19:09.390 --> 19:16.397
your Mr Nezmeroz is making promises
to rebuild the Russian empire.

19:16.605 --> 19:19.400
That sounds pretty rash
from where I sit.

19:19.608 --> 19:22.862
If I were sitting in Chechnya,
I'd be even more worried.

19:23.988 --> 19:27.616
Sir, Nemerov only said that
to get the hardliners off his back.

19:27.825 --> 19:30.536
If we leave him alone,
Russia will stabilise.

19:30.744 --> 19:36.250
When I asked for your advice, I didn't
mean that you should actually speak.

19:36.458 --> 19:38.711
Mr Cabot?

19:38.919 --> 19:43.799
Some of our assets in the Russian
government who know Mr Nemerov

19:44.008 --> 19:45.885
have not had a chance to report in.

19:46.093 --> 19:49.471
I'd like to take a couple of days
and gather more information for you

19:49.680 --> 19:52.099
before characterising him,

19:52.308 --> 19:56.228
but I do maintain my opinion
that appearances can be deceiving.

19:56.437 --> 19:58.647
You're saying I'm wrong?

19:59.523 --> 20:01.484
Absolutely, Mr Chairman.

20:04.403 --> 20:06.739
I don't think you're ugly.

20:09.158 --> 20:13.787
- I was out of line. I apologise.
- Senators don't like to be surprised.

20:13.996 --> 20:18.751
I hint at what I'm gonna tell them, then
I give them a while to get used to it.

20:18.959 --> 20:21.170
Then I tell them.

20:21.378 --> 20:24.673
- I understand.
- Good.

20:24.882 --> 20:27.343
But I'm right about Nemerov.

20:29.678 --> 20:33.307
Your girlfriend like
this stubborn streak in you?

20:33.516 --> 20:35.434
What?

20:35.643 --> 20:38.729
Cathy Muller,
second year surgical resident,

20:38.938 --> 20:41.273
Baltimore Memorial Hospital.

20:44.193 --> 20:46.487
Welcome to the CIA, sport.

20:49.156 --> 20:55.162
Your intelligence is a little flawed.
I wouldn't call her my girlfriend... yet.

20:55.371 --> 20:59.708
- What exactly would you call her?
- Great. Amazing.

20:59.917 --> 21:01.836
She's just afraid to commit.

21:02.044 --> 21:03.671
He's terrified of commitment.

21:03.879 --> 21:07.216
A man who's afraid of commitment
after three dates? Alert the media.

21:07.424 --> 21:10.511
- I know, I know.
- So what does he do?

21:10.719 --> 21:14.056
He was in the marines
before he hurt his back.

21:14.265 --> 21:16.684
- Now he's a historian.
- Yawn.

21:16.892 --> 21:20.521
No. He works for a think tank
across the river.

21:20.729 --> 21:22.314
Double yawn.

21:22.523 --> 21:27.528
All right, Rita. Let's see what you have
to say after we meet him tonight.

21:27.736 --> 21:29.405
He's...

21:31.115 --> 21:32.992
...cute?

21:33.200 --> 21:37.830
- I have fat fingers.
- Cathy! Cute scale, one to ten.

21:38.038 --> 21:40.958
Oh, God. I don't know.

21:42.543 --> 21:43.919
Twelve.

21:51.093 --> 21:52.887
Ask them where they found this.

22:00.936 --> 22:03.355
In the field, in the Golan.

22:03.564 --> 22:07.693
There was a lot of fighting there
in 1973. Did they witness it?

22:14.450 --> 22:17.203
This one says he lost his son.

22:17.411 --> 22:20.706
Does he remember,
was there a plane shot down?

22:30.090 --> 22:33.093
Yes, an Israeli jet, destroyed.

22:42.645 --> 22:44.688
This is worthless.

22:48.818 --> 22:54.740
But tell him I will give him $400...
because of his son.

23:05.835 --> 23:07.628
Thank... thank you.

23:09.255 --> 23:11.173
Thank you.

23:16.554 --> 23:18.013
How did you come by it?

23:18.222 --> 23:24.103
I found her in the attic of an old
mansion house in Glasgow.

23:24.311 --> 23:30.359
Your little trip to the attic has got you
a piece worth now about L1,000,

23:30.568 --> 23:35.072
even in this condition, and had she
been in better condition, even more.

23:35.281 --> 23:37.658
A jolly nice find.

23:55.467 --> 23:59.430
In fact, what I thought I'd found
was a garden ornament.

24:15.196 --> 24:16.697
Hello, Cathy?

24:16.906 --> 24:22.620
Hi. I'm glad you called. I'm running late.
Can you come a half an hour later?

24:23.078 --> 24:26.415
I can't make it. I'm really sorry.

24:29.293 --> 24:36.133
- It's a last-minute work thing.
- What's that noise?

24:38.928 --> 24:40.679
I'm calling from a plane.

24:40.888 --> 24:44.850
- This just came up. I tried to call you.
- Where are you going?

24:47.520 --> 24:49.855
- I can't tell you that.
- Jack.

24:50.064 --> 24:51.857
You can't tell me?

24:52.107 --> 24:53.484
Jack.

24:53.692 --> 24:56.487
- Hold on. Yes, sir?
- What are you doing?

24:57.863 --> 25:00.449
I had a date tonight, so I had to cancel.

25:00.658 --> 25:04.870
Don't be stupid. Tell her where you're
going. Tell her who you work for.

25:05.079 --> 25:07.706
She'll be impressed.

25:10.709 --> 25:14.213
OK. I work for the CIA.

25:14.421 --> 25:19.176
The director asked me to go with him to
Russia to do a nuclear arms inspection.

25:20.761 --> 25:23.931
- Hello?
- That is so lame.

25:24.139 --> 25:28.644
I swear, we get to inspect to make sure
they're decommissioning their arsenal.

25:32.815 --> 25:34.650
Hello?

25:34.859 --> 25:36.443
Hello?

25:41.365 --> 25:43.492
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

26:23.866 --> 26:27.453
Zdravstvuyte, William Cabot.

26:28.704 --> 26:30.247
President Nemerov.

26:43.886 --> 26:45.679
Pleasure, sir.

26:45.888 --> 26:48.057
May I present Mrs Lathrop.

26:48.265 --> 26:49.850
Mr President.

26:50.059 --> 26:52.853
- General Rand.
- Mr President.

26:53.062 --> 26:55.356
- Dr Ryan.
- Mr President.

27:00.569 --> 27:05.032
You must be the Dr Ryan who's done
such interesting research on me.

27:08.410 --> 27:11.539
You should not be surprised.
We know quite a bit.

27:15.918 --> 27:19.922
We know how wrong your report was
that I had many girlfriends in college.

27:28.389 --> 27:32.893
I met my wife in my third year and have
not looked at another woman since.

27:33.102 --> 27:37.356
I was referring to
the first two years... sir.

27:41.569 --> 27:47.158
Where you received
highest honors in English.

27:50.953 --> 27:52.496
I like him.

27:54.290 --> 27:57.001
Well, in that case, so do I.

28:00.129 --> 28:03.841
I apologise for interjecting myself
in your inspection tour,

28:04.049 --> 28:07.136
but I have a message
for President Fowler.

28:07.344 --> 28:09.930
You could just call him on the phone.

28:10.139 --> 28:14.268
I would like him to hear it from you,
his friend of many years,

28:14.476 --> 28:16.478
who received it personally from me,

28:16.687 --> 28:21.442
and saw my expression and the
language of my body as I spoke it.

28:21.650 --> 28:23.277
I understand.

28:24.737 --> 28:26.947
Chechnya is an internal affair.

28:27.156 --> 28:30.659
What we do there should be
none of your concern.

28:31.785 --> 28:34.622
I will relay the message,
but I don't think he will agree.

28:34.830 --> 28:38.334
Some people in my country
will use this issue to weaken me.

28:39.543 --> 28:41.212
Some people in my country say

28:41.420 --> 28:45.341
your war in Chechnya
is exactly your weakness.

28:46.258 --> 28:47.968
Chechnya is a nation of criminals.

28:48.177 --> 28:52.348
Every day brings another cowardly
attack on innocent Russian citizens.

28:52.556 --> 28:54.433
It is none of your concern.

28:56.477 --> 28:59.104
Stability is our concern.

28:59.313 --> 29:02.399
Peace in Chechnya is our concern.

29:03.150 --> 29:06.195
And, if I may speak frankly...

29:07.238 --> 29:10.407
...your control over your military
concerns us too.

29:18.207 --> 29:24.463
For you to get involved here, it's... like
sleeping with another man's wife.

29:26.090 --> 29:29.176
And what you are suggesting
is that afterward

29:29.385 --> 29:32.596
they can all live together
under the same roof.

29:34.431 --> 29:39.812
But what really happens is
the betrayed husband buys a gun.

29:49.321 --> 29:52.575
- That went well.
- Who's the guy with Nemerov?

29:52.783 --> 29:55.369
- Anatoli Grushkov.
- Old KGB?

29:55.578 --> 30:00.708
He's been around since Brezhnev.
Nobody's had the guts to get rid of him.

30:00.916 --> 30:02.877
Because he knows
where the bodies are buried?

30:03.085 --> 30:04.920
He probably buried them himself.

30:19.894 --> 30:24.482
And we were able to obtain a roster
of their scientists at Arzamas.

30:24.690 --> 30:27.443
Who's who, what their expertise is.

31:00.768 --> 31:02.394
Arzamas-16 is home

31:02.645 --> 31:06.941
to the All-Russian Scientific Research
Institute of Experimental Physics

31:07.149 --> 31:11.237
and is the birthplace
of our first atomic bomb.

31:11.821 --> 31:16.617
Many of our greatest scientists
worked here and many still do.

31:16.826 --> 31:18.619
Since 1995,

31:18.828 --> 31:22.498
we have dismantled
over 10,000 nuclear devices.

31:27.378 --> 31:31.298
We tried so hard to get in here
over the years.

31:31.507 --> 31:33.968
I sent three people.

31:35.302 --> 31:37.805
They all died trying.

32:04.373 --> 32:06.876
What does the T-shirt say?

32:07.084 --> 32:12.673
"I am a bomb technician. If you
see me running... try to catch up."

32:16.594 --> 32:17.887
OK.

32:19.054 --> 32:23.517
Sir, I'm sorry. Just one quick thing.
I'm sure it's nothing.

32:23.726 --> 32:28.314
According to this, there are
17 senior scientists on duty today.

32:30.733 --> 32:32.193
I only count 14.

32:33.569 --> 32:39.909
Doctors Milinov, Orlov and Spassky.
They don't seem to be here.

32:41.410 --> 32:43.370
I will make inquiries.

32:43.579 --> 32:46.707
Dr Milinov is out sick.
Orlov is on vacation.

32:46.916 --> 32:50.503
Spassky, I'm grieved to say,
was killed

32:50.711 --> 32:53.756
driving his car to work
just this past week.

32:58.802 --> 33:01.180
We move on, shall we?

33:01.847 --> 33:03.140
Please.

33:05.851 --> 33:10.564
Very impressive. You almost seem
to have that information memorised.

33:10.773 --> 33:13.567
I assumed you would ask, Dr Ryan.

33:49.145 --> 33:53.107
We touch down at Andrews at 2130.
Tell him to meet me there.

33:53.315 --> 33:55.943
Sir? Those three missing scientists.

33:56.152 --> 33:58.362
Milinov's expertise is detonators.

33:58.571 --> 34:01.532
Spassky's expertise
is the nuclear core.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.409
Orlov is a mathematician

34:03.617 --> 34:08.414
whose expertise is the geometry of
high explosives inside a fission bomb.

34:08.621 --> 34:12.333
The exact three men you would need
if you wanted to build a bomb.

34:12.543 --> 34:15.462
- Grushkov said...
- Grushkov's a liar.

34:15.670 --> 34:19.132
Milinov is not sick.
Orlov hardly ever takes a vacation

34:19.341 --> 34:23.929
and Spassky, who's supposed to have
died driving a car, doesn't drive.

34:25.514 --> 34:28.475
They have no idea
where these guys are.

34:29.851 --> 34:32.228
I'm dying to ask you how you know.

34:38.985 --> 34:41.071
Secure source inside the Kremlin.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.157
Codename Spinnaker.

34:43.364 --> 34:46.327
He gives me stuff, I give him stuff.

34:46.534 --> 34:50.956
We keep the back channels open
in hopes of staving off disaster.

34:51.165 --> 34:55.252
And speaking of disaster,
did you call your girlfriend yet?

34:55.960 --> 34:58.839
No. I don't know how to get out of this.

34:59.590 --> 35:04.845
All right. Invite her to the White House
correspondents dinner Sunday night.

35:05.054 --> 35:07.556
It's the hottest ticket in town.

35:08.807 --> 35:12.853
- Sounds great. How do I get in?
- Trust me.

35:27.076 --> 35:29.370
I'll see you at the car.

35:40.798 --> 35:42.508
Still loving your desk job?

35:44.009 --> 35:46.554
Yeah, I am.

35:46.762 --> 35:49.056
How's your Russian?

35:49.265 --> 35:50.975
Still works. Why?

35:52.393 --> 35:56.856
Three Russian nuclear scientists are
missing. I need to know where they are.

36:01.902 --> 36:03.696
I wasn't doing this any more.

36:03.904 --> 36:06.615
I just need information this time,
Johnny.

36:06.824 --> 36:11.495
Your orders are on the plane.
Wheels up at 2330. Have a nice flight.

36:21.005 --> 36:25.801
Sunday night, 8.00, at the Hilton. The
tickets are in the name of John Clark.

36:26.427 --> 36:29.555
- You do have a tux?
- Yeah, yes, sir.

36:35.978 --> 36:41.484
My beautiful wife, Julie, is from
New Jersey. 15 electoral votes.

36:43.486 --> 36:45.946
And is, as you know, half-Jewish,

36:46.155 --> 36:50.493
so we'll take Florida's
25 electoral votes and divide by two.

36:52.578 --> 36:54.538
- This is a nice hotel.
- Yeah. Beautiful.

36:55.831 --> 37:00.628
My friend Rita stayed here once.
She said it was... nice.

37:02.630 --> 37:06.133
Maybe after dinner we can...

37:06.342 --> 37:08.719
...we can get a room here.

37:08.928 --> 37:11.138
I already did.

37:12.431 --> 37:15.017
- You didn't.
- Yes, I did.

37:16.393 --> 37:20.523
...I did, on a handful of occasions,
smoke marijuana.

37:22.066 --> 37:25.319
California, 54 electoral votes.

38:02.898 --> 38:07.194
At 0600 Moscow time, the Russians
launched a massive artillery strike

38:07.403 --> 38:10.573
against Grozny,
the capital of Chechnya.

38:10.781 --> 38:15.578
The shells contained an experimental
chemical weapon, a nerve agent.

38:15.786 --> 38:19.456
Saturation, you can see
on the sat photos, took 20 minutes,

38:19.665 --> 38:23.210
after which every person
inside a radius of 12 miles

38:23.419 --> 38:28.257
was rendered helpless by symptoms
approximating late-stage cerebral palsy.

38:28.465 --> 38:31.051
- Oh, my God.
- How many dead?

38:32.428 --> 38:34.722
Best guess, 80%.

38:35.431 --> 38:40.728
Nemerov launched the biggest attack
in the history of chemical warfare.

38:40.936 --> 38:44.648
- Let's talk response.
- The worst thing we can do is nothing.

38:44.857 --> 38:49.570
If he gets away with chemical weapons,
what's next? Biological, nuclear?

38:49.778 --> 38:54.450
OK. Short of gassing the Kremlin,
what's the strongest response?

38:54.658 --> 38:57.369
- We send in peacekeepers.
- Chechnya's not sovereign.

38:57.578 --> 39:02.583
They requested recognition, so we
give it. Not full diplomatic, provisional.

39:02.791 --> 39:07.588
Then the Chechens request assistance
and we send in peacekeepers.

39:07.796 --> 39:11.258
- How do you get them in there?
- We fly them in from Turkey.

39:11.467 --> 39:16.263
- Over Armenian air space?
- To screw Russia? They won't complain.

39:17.848 --> 39:21.185
Let's do it. Nemerov can choke on it.

39:22.144 --> 39:23.437
Bill?

39:24.355 --> 39:26.273
- Dr Ryan.
- Yes, sir.

39:26.482 --> 39:28.526
What do you think?

39:34.198 --> 39:37.034
Conventional wisdom suggests

39:37.243 --> 39:40.120
that Nemerov is playing
the traditional Russian role:

39:40.329 --> 39:44.291
Be aggressive, flex your muscles,
dare the world to stop you.

39:44.500 --> 39:48.003
- But Nemerov isn't conventional.
- He acts like a hardliner.

39:48.212 --> 39:50.631
With respect, I don't think he is one.

39:50.840 --> 39:55.302
He just gassed the capital of another
country. With respect, you're wrong.

39:55.511 --> 40:00.641
- So what are we wasting our time for?
- What if he didn't order the attack?

40:02.601 --> 40:05.938
What if Nemerov
didn't order the attack?

40:06.897 --> 40:11.443
What if it was a... a rogue general?

40:11.652 --> 40:15.739
Or a military unit frustrated they
couldn't get the rebels out of the city?

40:15.948 --> 40:21.078
Have you reason to believe he didn't
order it, or are you just floating this?

40:22.746 --> 40:24.248
You don't know.

40:28.544 --> 40:33.132
I don't think he did it, sir.
I would bet he didn't do it.

40:36.260 --> 40:40.014
Will senior staff remain behind
for a few minutes, please?

41:02.620 --> 41:06.248
Russia's newly-installed president,
Alexander Nemerov,

41:06.457 --> 41:11.879
has just begun to address the state.
We join him in progress.

41:16.091 --> 41:19.678
For ten years now,
we have contended...

41:19.887 --> 41:22.890
Excuse me. Could you turn that up?

41:24.016 --> 41:26.268
...toward innocent Russian citizens.

41:28.312 --> 41:29.730
Finally...

41:30.856 --> 41:34.401
...every nation has a right
to defend itself.

41:36.320 --> 41:39.031
This terrorism must end.

41:40.074 --> 41:44.370
The bombing of Chechnya...
was my decision.

41:48.249 --> 41:50.251
Nice going, ace.

42:02.429 --> 42:03.764
Who did it?

42:03.973 --> 42:07.393
General Pildysh, General Mitkin.
Unhappy old Communists.

42:07.601 --> 42:09.436
Bastards.

42:09.645 --> 42:12.690
- Relieve them of command.
- I will shoot them myself.

42:12.898 --> 42:15.109
Just disappear them.

42:15.317 --> 42:19.613
Their execution would tell the world
I didn't have control.

42:19.822 --> 42:25.035
These days, better to appear guilty
than impotent.

42:28.164 --> 42:31.041
How is our Russian friend
affected by this?

42:33.794 --> 42:39.675
I am not affected.
I remain devoted to our little plan.

42:40.676 --> 42:44.054
At what you're charging us,
I am not surprised.

42:44.263 --> 42:47.725
- And the American?
- Mr Mason is a believer.

42:47.933 --> 42:51.645
I put a little extra
in the escrow account for him.

42:51.854 --> 42:56.317
- Why?
- He won't live long enough to get it.

42:56.525 --> 43:00.571
- Where is the package?
- It left Haifa a week ago.

43:02.239 --> 43:04.408
I'm told these things can kill you.

43:08.037 --> 43:11.332
But so much has changed.

43:12.708 --> 43:19.465
Perhaps the new situation suggests
we consider... a different approach?

43:22.635 --> 43:26.388
Maybe try to bring Russia
more into Europe,

43:26.597 --> 43:29.558
more into our way of thinking?

43:29.767 --> 43:33.103
We have discussed that,
Monsieur Monceau,

43:33.312 --> 43:36.440
and with your concurrence, rejected it.

43:36.649 --> 43:39.819
Oh. Perhaps we were hasty.

43:40.027 --> 43:43.197
- Perhaps our plan is...
- Is what?

43:47.785 --> 43:50.538
Not perfectly conceived.

43:52.915 --> 43:58.295
Are you crazy? All over
the world, right-wing parties,

43:58.504 --> 44:03.259
nationalist movements,
Nazis, Aryan Nations,

44:03.467 --> 44:06.720
all working together for the first time.

44:06.929 --> 44:08.722
Is that not perfect?

44:16.355 --> 44:21.318
Well, I respect the will and judgment
of my friends.

44:22.111 --> 44:26.157
But in light of the week's events,
I am grown...

44:27.408 --> 44:30.286
...uncomfortable with this plan.

44:30.494 --> 44:34.081
So I must... beg your leave.

44:40.087 --> 44:41.755
Gentlemen.

44:46.927 --> 44:49.430
Herr Haft will help you out.

44:55.060 --> 44:56.604
Your scarf, monsieur.

45:12.828 --> 45:16.123
Watch it with that thing.
You're gonna kill somebody.

45:44.860 --> 45:46.821
Yo, what's up, Mason?

45:49.490 --> 45:54.245
You know, I always wanted to ask
you... Where'd you get that tat, man?

45:57.331 --> 45:58.624
The navy.

45:58.833 --> 46:01.252
The navy? I was in the navy.

46:02.253 --> 46:05.673
Hospital ship, six years. You?

46:09.051 --> 46:10.386
Eight months.

46:11.428 --> 46:13.347
Oh. You wash out?

46:21.230 --> 46:23.524
All right, brother.
You have a good one.

46:26.735 --> 46:28.612
Yeah, brother.

46:35.870 --> 46:41.083
...not realising the rest of the world is
watching and will take a cue from us...

46:41.292 --> 46:44.795
The unprecedented attack
on Chechnya

46:45.004 --> 46:46.338
signals a dangerous
and troubling shift in Russian policy.

46:49.091 --> 46:53.888
It demands the toughest and most
unambiguous response from the West.

46:54.763 --> 46:59.852
NATO forces are on their way to
Chechnya to serve as peacekeepers

47:00.060 --> 47:05.900
and to provide humanitarian aid
to victims of this monstrous...

47:08.944 --> 47:11.071
I expected this.

47:11.280 --> 47:12.990
Really?

47:18.621 --> 47:20.080
What will you do?

47:20.289 --> 47:22.500
Nothing.

47:22.708 --> 47:26.420
We will do nothing.

47:28.297 --> 47:32.760
These are four hours old. Russian
12th, 15th and 2nd tank regiments.

47:32.968 --> 47:35.221
Why haven't they moved?

47:35.429 --> 47:38.474
- Nemerov's too smart to move them.
- He speaks.

47:38.682 --> 47:43.938
Jack, Nemerov's got, like, 19,000
tanks. No way NATO can match that.

47:44.146 --> 47:46.482
That's why he's not gonna move them.

47:46.690 --> 47:50.653
It's like chess.
He's thinking three moves ahead.

47:50.861 --> 47:55.115
The NATO playbook says we can only
stop him with tactical nuclear weapons.

47:55.324 --> 47:58.953
And he won't risk a nuclear war
over this.

48:00.204 --> 48:05.501
I also think he's sending us
a message. He didn't bomb Grozny.

48:16.512 --> 48:19.473
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Mrs Spassky.

48:19.682 --> 48:22.184
At the end of the corridor.

48:28.357 --> 48:31.485
I haven't seen Sasha since university.

48:31.694 --> 48:36.824
And you were his teaching assistant?
Strange, I don't remember you.

48:37.032 --> 48:41.662
When he heard I was in Arzamas,
he asked me to look in on you.

48:44.915 --> 48:49.211
- He says he'll take me to the West.
- That would require a lot of money.

48:49.420 --> 48:53.674
Just because the imbeciles here pay
him nothing doesn't mean others won't.

48:53.883 --> 48:56.844
He has a secret job.

48:57.887 --> 48:59.638
For the government?

48:59.847 --> 49:02.016
For imbeciles with money.

49:02.433 --> 49:08.022
Same nonsense, do this, don't do that.

49:08.230 --> 49:10.483
They even told him
not to call his mother.

49:11.484 --> 49:12.693
The pigs.

49:12.902 --> 49:17.490
I could die any day
and he can't phone his mother.

49:17.698 --> 49:21.911
But my Sasha, he called.

49:22.119 --> 49:24.205
Just last night.

49:29.168 --> 49:34.548
Clark got us her number. NSA traced
calls to that number back to here.

49:34.757 --> 49:39.887
It's an abandoned Soviet army base
on the Kremenchug reservoir.

49:42.515 --> 49:46.268
What are three Russian atomic
scientists doing in Ukraine?

49:47.520 --> 49:49.814
A fair guess, they're building a bomb.

49:50.022 --> 49:54.652
Nemerov has thousands of bombs.
Why would he build a secret one?

49:54.860 --> 49:56.737
Deniability.

49:57.571 --> 50:02.993
Build one nobody knows about, he can
drive it to Chechnya in his Beemer.

50:03.202 --> 50:05.913
No way to track it, no way to trace it.

50:06.956 --> 50:10.292
He could set it off and say,
"I didn't do it."

50:11.627 --> 50:14.213
With respect, I don't think
that adds up.

50:14.421 --> 50:18.843
It adds up. You just don't like
what it adds up to.

50:50.624 --> 50:54.378
Ah, the warmth of plutonium decay.

50:54.587 --> 50:59.425
It's completely corroded.
At least you're wearing gloves.

51:06.682 --> 51:10.060
Anyone want to light up
an American cigarette?

51:11.061 --> 51:13.063
You're crazy.

51:16.108 --> 51:17.902
I'm going out.

51:21.906 --> 51:24.658
The explosive blocks
must be replaced.

51:24.867 --> 51:27.495
Machined to a thousandth
of a millimetre

51:27.703 --> 51:30.539
in a mathematically determined
configuration.

51:31.248 --> 51:36.086
- Do we have a bomb?
- First we must analyse the yield...

51:36.295 --> 51:39.423
Do we have a bomb?

51:42.218 --> 51:43.761
Yes.

51:46.430 --> 51:48.390
Yes, we do.

52:05.115 --> 52:08.160
This is a... a test.

52:11.956 --> 52:13.707
Answer it.

52:14.208 --> 52:16.794
- Answer it.
- Are you sure?

52:21.423 --> 52:23.050
Hello?

52:23.634 --> 52:25.052
Yes.

52:31.392 --> 52:32.726
Yes, sir.

52:38.774 --> 52:41.360
I have to go outside for just a second.

52:42.486 --> 52:44.363
OK? I'll be right back.

52:44.572 --> 52:47.074
I'll be right back.

53:02.381 --> 53:06.302
- Sir, I write reports.
- I reviewed your military records.

53:06.510 --> 53:10.764
- You can take care of yourself.
- Yes, sir. But I'm not trained for that.

53:10.973 --> 53:17.271
I'm not asking you to be an operations
officer, just my eyes and ears. I can't go.

53:19.273 --> 53:22.318
So... this isn't sanctioned.

53:26.322 --> 53:30.576
I want you to give this to Clark,
see what he finds out, bring it home.

53:32.995 --> 53:34.288
Yes, sir.

53:37.500 --> 53:39.126
Jack...

53:40.419 --> 53:43.172
...we never had this discussion.

53:43.380 --> 53:45.382
What discussion?

53:59.438 --> 54:03.150
OK. Clark... So this is
three days ago.

54:03.359 --> 54:07.238
It shows vehicles here.
Guards here and here.

54:07.446 --> 54:09.240
I gotta get one of those.

54:10.199 --> 54:14.995
Now, the infrared satellite
took this photograph 34 hours ago.

54:15.579 --> 54:18.457
That shows guards here and here.

54:18.874 --> 54:21.168
I don't even have e-mail.

54:22.837 --> 54:26.757
There are two at the checkpoint,
between two and five in the barracks

54:26.966 --> 54:30.261
and two with the package,
which we believe to be here.

54:30.469 --> 54:33.973
No problem. Give me a couple
of guys, some tranquilliser darts,

54:34.181 --> 54:36.058
we can be out in six minutes.

54:36.267 --> 54:38.853
- There is a problem.
- What's that?

54:39.061 --> 54:42.523
This is yesterday.
No guards visible at all.

54:44.316 --> 54:46.318
Why is that a problem, Mr Ryan?

54:46.527 --> 54:51.198
For two reasons. Either we can't
see them, which is bad,

54:51.407 --> 54:53.701
or worse, they left, and we're too late.

54:55.452 --> 54:56.745
Suit up.

54:56.954 --> 54:59.582
- What?
- You can't go dressed like that.

55:00.624 --> 55:05.796
No, no. I'm an analyst.
I don't go on missions.

55:06.005 --> 55:09.508
Relax, 007. It's not a mission.
It's just a recce.

55:09.717 --> 55:13.429
OK, fine, whatever you call it.
I don't do that. I just write reports.

55:13.637 --> 55:17.224
OK. So write a report about it. Suit up.

55:17.433 --> 55:18.726
Clark, no.

55:19.435 --> 55:21.937
Clark... no.

55:23.939 --> 55:28.110
So, Cabot tells me you got my ticket
to the correspondents dinner.

55:28.694 --> 55:33.199
Have a good time?
I've never been to one of those.

55:33.407 --> 55:36.327
I was actually looking forward to it.

55:55.095 --> 55:58.057
Clark, no. I'm not going in there.

55:58.265 --> 56:02.561
Goddamn right. You're gonna stay here
and make sure no one steals my boat.

56:02.770 --> 56:04.647
Be right back.

58:02.223 --> 58:03.432
Damn.

59:37.109 --> 59:38.986
Oh, Jesus.

59:39.612 --> 59:42.573
Oh, God. Immigration didn't
call you guys, huh?

59:47.244 --> 59:51.499
I'm sorry. You speak English?
I don't speak much Ukrainian.

59:53.834 --> 59:57.296
It's not what you think. I'm an
American citizen. I have my papers...

59:58.214 --> 01:00:00.799
OK. No papers.

01:00:01.008 --> 01:00:03.511
Please. Just put the gun down.

01:00:05.262 --> 01:00:08.015
The light? You want
me to put the light down?

01:00:09.975 --> 01:00:13.062
OK. Take it easy.
I'll put the light down.

01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:15.731
Here we go, I'm putting it down.

01:00:27.243 --> 01:00:28.911
Shoot him, Ryan.

01:00:29.787 --> 01:00:31.247
Shoot him.

01:00:36.877 --> 01:00:39.922
Shoot him before he figures out
what I'm saying.

01:00:46.804 --> 01:00:49.807
- Get their shoes.
- What?

01:00:50.015 --> 01:00:52.518
Tell them to take their shoes off.

01:01:02.444 --> 01:01:06.490
- You speak Ukrainian.
- Yeah. You don't?

01:01:13.164 --> 01:01:18.586
Whatever it is they were spray painting
was big, about the size of a fridge.

01:01:18.794 --> 01:01:21.922
The imprint it left was deep.
So we know three things.

01:01:22.131 --> 01:01:26.760
It was heavy, something was
radioactive, and now it's gone.

01:01:28.804 --> 01:01:31.891
- One of them spoke English?
- South African.

01:01:32.099 --> 01:01:35.102
So, what's a South African
doing in the Ukraine

01:01:35.311 --> 01:01:38.647
with three Russian scientists
and a crate from Israel?

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:47.990
- Tell Cabot I'll call him from Haifa.
- I have a feeling you better hurry.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.916
Most people believe the 20th century
was defined by the death struggle

01:01:57.124 --> 01:01:59.752
of communism versus capitalism

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:03.297
and that fascism was but a hiccup.

01:02:04.632 --> 01:02:06.592
Today we know better.

01:02:08.219 --> 01:02:13.599
Communism was a fool's errand. The
followers of Marx, gone from this earth.

01:02:13.808 --> 01:02:17.311
But the followers of Hitler
abound and thrive.

01:02:18.187 --> 01:02:21.690
Hitler, however,
had one great disadvantage.

01:02:21.899 --> 01:02:25.444
He lived in a time when fascism,
like a virus,

01:02:25.653 --> 01:02:28.030
like the AIDS virus,

01:02:28.239 --> 01:02:33.953
needed a strong host in order to spread.
Germany was that host.

01:02:34.161 --> 01:02:37.581
But strong as it was,
Germany could not prevail.

01:02:37.790 --> 01:02:40.376
The world was too big.

01:02:40.584 --> 01:02:44.380
Fortunately, the world has changed.

01:02:44.588 --> 01:02:49.009
Global communications,
cable TV, the internet.

01:02:49.218 --> 01:02:51.971
Today the world is smaller

01:02:52.179 --> 01:02:56.350
and the virus does not need
a strong host in order to spread.

01:02:57.143 --> 01:02:59.228
This virus...

01:02:59.979 --> 01:03:02.106
...is airborne.

01:03:04.108 --> 01:03:08.487
One more thing.
Let no man call us crazy.

01:03:08.696 --> 01:03:13.742
They called Hitler crazy, but Hitler
wasn't crazy. He was stupid.

01:03:13.951 --> 01:03:16.537
You don't fight Russia and America.

01:03:16.745 --> 01:03:20.499
You get Russia and America
to fight each other

01:03:20.708 --> 01:03:23.752
and destroy each other.

01:03:59.955 --> 01:04:03.918
- What did you find?
- Ukraine's exports are online.

01:04:04.126 --> 01:04:06.045
I pulled up the shipping manifests.

01:04:06.253 --> 01:04:11.050
The only crate that size was picked up
at Kiev International ten days ago

01:04:11.258 --> 01:04:13.052
and flown to the Canary Islands.

01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:16.347
The air force has a nuclear
assessment team. Call them...

01:04:16.555 --> 01:04:20.768
Jack, it got put on a cargo freighter,
headed for the East Coast.

01:04:21.811 --> 01:04:25.898
- What?
- Baltimore. It's coming here.

01:04:34.156 --> 01:04:38.953
It's a great view from the Budweiser
blimp as we count down to game time.

01:04:39.161 --> 01:04:41.747
We'll have the pre-game festivities

01:04:41.956 --> 01:04:46.252
as well as the arrival of the nation's
number one football fan in a moment.

01:04:46.961 --> 01:04:51.632
Then conquer we must

01:04:51.841 --> 01:04:56.178
For our cause it is just

01:04:56.637 --> 01:05:01.642
And this be our motto

01:05:01.851 --> 01:05:06.021
In God is our trust

01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:10.901
And the star-spangled banner

01:05:11.110 --> 01:05:19.994
Forever shall wave

01:05:20.703 --> 01:05:25.958
O'er the land of the free...

01:05:26.834 --> 01:05:29.044
Get me the duty officer!

01:05:29.253 --> 01:05:37.136
Home of the brave

01:05:46.187 --> 01:05:49.857
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States,

01:05:50.065 --> 01:05:52.318
Robert Fowler!

01:05:56.655 --> 01:05:58.282
Showtime.

01:06:28.938 --> 01:06:30.231
Shit.

01:06:37.279 --> 01:06:40.032
15 yard penalty, first down.

01:06:40.241 --> 01:06:41.659
That's the way!

01:06:49.542 --> 01:06:50.501
Shit.

01:07:11.147 --> 01:07:12.106
Hello.

01:07:13.274 --> 01:07:15.317
- Hello?
- Sir!

01:07:15.526 --> 01:07:18.279
- Hello?
- Sir!

01:07:22.324 --> 01:07:23.617
Shit!

01:07:40.176 --> 01:07:42.261
- Cabot.
- It's Ryan.

01:07:44.805 --> 01:07:47.641
- What?
- The bomb is in play.

01:07:47.850 --> 01:07:53.647
The AFRAT team are meeting me at
the docks in 20 minutes to try to find it.

01:07:53.856 --> 01:07:56.400
- What docks?
- Baltimore.

01:07:56.609 --> 01:08:00.404
- You're breaking up. What did you say?
- Baltimore.

01:08:00.613 --> 01:08:04.658
- I'm losing you. I'll call you back...
- Baltimore.

01:08:07.077 --> 01:08:08.537
Sir!

01:08:34.395 --> 01:08:37.107
John! Red-Green! Let's go! Let's go!

01:08:37.942 --> 01:08:39.902
Move it! Let's go!

01:08:49.245 --> 01:08:51.663
Move! Go, go, go, go! Move!

01:09:00.464 --> 01:09:02.424
What the hell is going on?

01:09:02.633 --> 01:09:07.054
Some Russian scientists made a
nuclear bomb. It's arrived in Baltimore.

01:09:07.263 --> 01:09:10.808
- Get those people out of the stadium.
- Stay down!

01:09:32.621 --> 01:09:35.791
The President has been taken
off the field.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.711
- 407.
- Thanks, JJ.

01:10:25.424 --> 01:10:29.386
Clearly something has happened
of tremendous proportions.

01:10:29.595 --> 01:10:34.975
We have no word as to what but
there is an enormous cloud over...

01:11:09.343 --> 01:11:11.053
Go, go, go!

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:20.855
Mr President! Are you all right?

01:11:21.063 --> 01:11:23.232
He's stuck. Get out of the way.

01:11:27.945 --> 01:11:30.030
Mr President, are you all right?

01:11:34.410 --> 01:11:37.872
Are you all right, Mr President?
This is the marines, sir.

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:39.707
I need your help, Danny.

01:11:39.915 --> 01:11:43.127
Alvarez, get me a stretcher, now!

01:11:45.588 --> 01:11:47.673
You got the stretcher?

01:11:54.346 --> 01:11:58.225
- You got the stretcher?
- No, I don't want one.

01:11:58.434 --> 01:12:01.353
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

01:12:02.646 --> 01:12:04.148
Move it!

01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:14.617
Move it!

01:12:21.207 --> 01:12:24.001
Go, go! Close them off! Go on up!

01:12:48.818 --> 01:12:50.653
Mr President...

01:12:50.861 --> 01:12:54.448
There's been a nuclear explosion in
America. You must come with us now.

01:12:54.990 --> 01:12:56.534
What?

01:12:57.785 --> 01:13:02.039
We don't know who or how.
But it wasn't us.

01:13:02.248 --> 01:13:06.460
After Grozny you hope it wasn't us.

01:13:06.669 --> 01:13:09.171
We are drafting
a strong denial for you.

01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:12.049
And a statement of sympathy.

01:13:12.258 --> 01:13:15.678
And Yuri... order all military
on the alert.

01:15:02.868 --> 01:15:04.453
Hey! It's Ryan.

01:15:04.954 --> 01:15:08.374
- Jack, where are you?
- Somewhere outside Baltimore.

01:15:08.582 --> 01:15:11.502
- Cabot got the President out.
- Where is he now?

01:15:11.710 --> 01:15:16.674
They're taking him airborne, on NAOC.
They think it might be the Russians.

01:15:18.551 --> 01:15:22.972
It wasn't the Russians. I gotta talk to
Cabot. Patch me through to the plane.

01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:27.768
Cabot's not on the plane. We don't
know where he is. Call back in an hour.

01:15:27.977 --> 01:15:32.189
We don't have an hour.
Fowler's gonna want to hit back now.

01:15:33.732 --> 01:15:38.821
Listen. We have to prove it wasn't the
Russians before he's convinced it is.

01:15:39.029 --> 01:15:40.948
Can you get back to Langley?

01:15:41.157 --> 01:15:46.453
There's no time. The radiation
assessment team, where are they?

01:15:46.662 --> 01:15:49.290
Stambler Tunnels, south of the city.

01:15:50.291 --> 01:15:53.794
The prevailing winds are blowing
the fallout to the east and north.

01:15:54.003 --> 01:15:56.046
As long as you stay south you're OK.

01:15:58.424 --> 01:16:02.344
- Mr President, are you all right?
- How the hell do you think I am?

01:16:02.553 --> 01:16:04.805
- How many casualties?
- We don't know.

01:16:05.014 --> 01:16:10.144
- How the hell did it get there?
- We don't know. Radar didn't pick it up.

01:16:10.352 --> 01:16:13.981
- Well, how is Cabot? Where is he?
- I don't know.

01:16:14.190 --> 01:16:17.026
- What do you know?
- I don't know, all right? I don't know!

01:16:17.234 --> 01:16:18.903
I don't know!

01:16:31.582 --> 01:16:36.003
- General, Kondor is not on board.
- Send the AFRAT team.

01:16:37.379 --> 01:16:40.341
Mr President, I recommend
we move to DEFCON-2.

01:16:40.549 --> 01:16:42.134
Where's our intelligence?

01:16:42.343 --> 01:16:44.595
Russian air defences
are at their highest level.

01:16:44.804 --> 01:16:48.516
Maybe they're afraid of being attacked.
I can't get this goddamn chair open!

01:16:48.724 --> 01:16:50.059
We're about to take off.

01:16:50.267 --> 01:16:52.895
- We don't know who did it...
- We think the Russians...

01:16:53.103 --> 01:16:55.439
- You think?
- Sir, DEFCON-2.

01:16:55.648 --> 01:16:59.527
- We're groping in the dark...
- This is too much goddamn bullshit!

01:17:01.946 --> 01:17:04.240
And not enough fact.

01:17:18.879 --> 01:17:22.341
The blast crater is about
100, 150 yards wide,

01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:24.927
which suggests a low-yield device,

01:17:25.136 --> 01:17:28.097
quite a bit smaller
than the Hiroshima bomb.

01:17:28.305 --> 01:17:32.351
A quarter of a square mile
around the stadium is just gone.

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:36.897
Beyond that, buildings remain, heavily
damaged, for another quarter mile.

01:17:37.106 --> 01:17:40.901
The damage tapers off the farther
you get from Ground Zero.

01:17:50.286 --> 01:17:51.579
Dubinin.

01:17:51.787 --> 01:17:56.709
Herr Haft has left for America.
Now we are counting on you.

01:17:58.377 --> 01:18:02.590
I assure you,
I will earn every pfennig.

01:18:04.884 --> 01:18:06.760
Attention.

01:18:06.969 --> 01:18:09.096
You've heard of the bomb in the USA.

01:18:09.305 --> 01:18:11.599
What you haven't heard
is that 15 minutes ago

01:18:11.807 --> 01:18:16.061
an American ICBM hit Moscow.

01:18:16.270 --> 01:18:23.277
We are to retaliate against an American
aircraft carrier in the North Sea.

01:18:23.486 --> 01:18:25.988
Man your aircraft.

01:18:48.928 --> 01:18:52.807
The ash isn't radioactive. The winds
are blowing the fallout to sea.

01:18:53.015 --> 01:18:54.809
Captain. Jack Ryan, CIA.

01:18:55.017 --> 01:18:57.937
Lorna Shiro. You need to wait outside.

01:18:58.145 --> 01:19:00.856
I need to know all you know
about the bomb.

01:19:01.065 --> 01:19:06.987
We're collecting samples. Get in line
and we'll have the report out tomorrow.

01:19:07.196 --> 01:19:10.991
Captain, I need to know now
where this bomb came from,

01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:15.746
or even where it didn't come from
or there may not be a tomorrow.

01:19:16.539 --> 01:19:19.166
Shit. Wesson, where are you?

01:19:19.375 --> 01:19:21.335
About a quarter mile from Ground Zero.

01:19:21.544 --> 01:19:26.632
This is about as far as we'll go.
My feet are sizzling.

01:19:26.841 --> 01:19:29.885
I'm getting rads
nearly the limit of our gear.

01:19:30.094 --> 01:19:33.639
- OK. Cut the rover loose and get out.
- Roger that.

01:19:43.732 --> 01:19:48.362
Dillon, the crate the bomb was shipped
in. Somebody had to sign for it at port.

01:19:48.571 --> 01:19:52.283
Customs must have a database.
Get me a name. Where's Cabot?

01:19:52.491 --> 01:19:55.119
No one knows.
We're checking the hospitals.

01:19:55.327 --> 01:19:57.830
- Have you tried Memorial?
- He wouldn't be there.

01:19:58.038 --> 01:20:01.208
No, I mean... Is it still...

01:20:03.419 --> 01:20:05.713
It's Cathy's hospital.

01:20:06.464 --> 01:20:09.592
As far as I know it's still there,
but the phones are down.

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:12.303
All right. Can you keep checking?
Thanks.

01:20:15.931 --> 01:20:19.560
They could have launched
a cruise missile.

01:20:19.768 --> 01:20:22.730
- We don't know that this is Russia.
- We don't know it's not.

01:20:22.938 --> 01:20:28.486
If they were sending us a message,
they'd want us to know it was them.

01:20:28.694 --> 01:20:32.573
Except they could inspire
the confusion we're going through now.

01:20:32.781 --> 01:20:34.867
Mr President, we're uplinked.

01:20:38.245 --> 01:20:44.376
President Nemerov, there's been a
major nuclear event in the United States.

01:20:44.585 --> 01:20:46.086
Loss of life is severe.

01:20:46.295 --> 01:20:48.881
- It was no accident.
- It was not an accident.

01:20:49.089 --> 01:20:52.468
We don't yet know where
it came from, we don't...

01:20:52.676 --> 01:20:58.349
We have not yet ascertained the
source of this weapon. Rest assured...

01:20:58.557 --> 01:21:03.354
We have not yet ascertained
the source of this weapon.

01:21:03.979 --> 01:21:08.651
But rest assured those responsible
will be dealt with most severely.

01:21:10.653 --> 01:21:13.113
He's fishing.

01:21:13.322 --> 01:21:15.282
Send our reply.

01:21:17.326 --> 01:21:19.370
Whoa, that was a little fast.

01:21:19.578 --> 01:21:22.706
"Please accept the deepest
sympathies of the Russian people."

01:21:22.915 --> 01:21:26.210
"If it was deliberate,
this is a crime without precedent."

01:21:26.418 --> 01:21:29.463
"What madman would do such a thing
and for what purpose?"

01:21:29.672 --> 01:21:32.967
"You must believe that Russia had
nothing to do with this infamous act."

01:21:33.175 --> 01:21:36.637
It's canned.
He prepared that in advance.

01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:42.143
President Nemerov, we've no reason
to suspect Russian involvement...

01:21:42.351 --> 01:21:43.811
...at this time...

01:21:44.186 --> 01:21:49.733
...but we will protect ourselves
from further aggression.

01:21:51.026 --> 01:21:53.362
He thinks we did this.

01:21:53.571 --> 01:21:56.824
We must demonstrate
the strength of our weapons.

01:21:57.032 --> 01:22:02.663
They have to understand that
attacking Russia would be suicide.

01:22:02.872 --> 01:22:06.500
Increase the alert status.

01:22:42.745 --> 01:22:46.874
TAO, EW. I'm picking up
intermittent radar, bearing 020.

01:22:48.584 --> 01:22:50.002
Where?

01:22:52.755 --> 01:22:54.173
Now it's gone.

01:23:02.431 --> 01:23:04.391
There. It's a weak signal.

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.602
TAO, inbound contact.

01:23:12.399 --> 01:23:13.943
Multiples on the same bearing.

01:23:16.111 --> 01:23:18.280
- Vampire, vampire!
- Fast movers inbound.

01:23:18.489 --> 01:23:20.908
I got seven, eight, nine of them!

01:23:46.475 --> 01:23:49.228
The missiles definitely came
from Russian aircraft.

01:23:49.436 --> 01:23:52.773
Grennel thinks he can save the ship,
but flight ops are out.

01:23:55.484 --> 01:23:58.279
I ordered no such attack.

01:23:58.487 --> 01:24:01.282
You must not respond to this action...

01:24:01.490 --> 01:24:03.742
"...until we investigate all possibilities."

01:24:03.951 --> 01:24:05.953
Like you did in Chechnya?

01:24:06.162 --> 01:24:09.457
Mr President, who is in control
of your armed forces?

01:24:11.959 --> 01:24:14.962
You dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.

01:24:15.171 --> 01:24:18.132
You dropped the bomb on Nagasaki.

01:24:18.466 --> 01:24:21.177
Do not lecture me on Chechnya.

01:24:21.385 --> 01:24:25.097
"...lecture me on Chechnya."

01:24:25.306 --> 01:24:32.146
Mr President, we are now at a
de facto state of war with the Russians.

01:24:37.735 --> 01:24:42.698
John Clark was in Haifa yesterday.
We have to find him right away.

01:24:42.907 --> 01:24:44.783
Wow.
Look at that gadolinium reading.

01:24:44.992 --> 01:24:47.536
Yeah. The mass fraction is huge.

01:24:47.745 --> 01:24:50.664
OK, connect me to Dillon. I'll hold.

01:24:51.832 --> 01:24:55.294
There it is. Savannah River.

01:24:56.212 --> 01:24:58.714
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah, what?

01:24:58.923 --> 01:25:00.633
They had a gadolinium problem.

01:25:00.841 --> 01:25:04.637
Hanford does it another way,
and generate too much promethium.

01:25:04.845 --> 01:25:07.348
Hold on. Can you translate that
into English?

01:25:09.225 --> 01:25:13.604
This plutonium came from the DOE
plant at Savannah River, February '68,

01:25:13.813 --> 01:25:17.274
from K reactor. We even know
which part of K reactor.

01:25:17.483 --> 01:25:22.029
- Wait. This is our plutonium?
- Made in the USA.

01:25:24.114 --> 01:25:26.534
Dillon, you've got to find Cabot.

01:25:33.541 --> 01:25:36.252
Are you advocating we launch
a first strike?

01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:41.423
It is not a first strike! There's already
been a first strike, and a second.

01:25:41.632 --> 01:25:43.926
- Don't you get it?
- No, I don't get it!

01:25:44.135 --> 01:25:47.805
I don't understand why we have
to nuke them! It's not reasonable.

01:25:48.013 --> 01:25:50.099
Sidney, goddamn it!

01:25:50.307 --> 01:25:53.060
They practically sank
an aircraft carrier!

01:25:53.269 --> 01:25:56.897
Their missile silos are hot.
We're getting bullshit from Nemerov.

01:25:57.106 --> 01:26:01.986
Let's not forget how this started.
They tried to kill me, remember?

01:26:02.194 --> 01:26:04.155
Don't fucking tell me to be reasonable!

01:26:09.910 --> 01:26:13.914
Please come to the triage tent
on the side of the building.

01:26:14.123 --> 01:26:17.084
We will help you find
who you are looking for,

01:26:17.293 --> 01:26:20.254
but we are low on blood supply.

01:26:47.323 --> 01:26:48.657
Sir?

01:26:50.701 --> 01:26:52.077
Sir?

01:26:53.412 --> 01:26:55.664
Hi.

01:26:58.334 --> 01:27:00.961
What?

01:27:01.170 --> 01:27:04.715
- President?
- The President's fine.

01:27:04.924 --> 01:27:07.635
He's fine. Sir...

01:27:08.511 --> 01:27:11.138
The bomb. The plutonium...

01:27:11.347 --> 01:27:13.641
- Wife.
- What?

01:27:14.308 --> 01:27:15.643
Wife.

01:27:15.851 --> 01:27:19.563
Your wife? I'm sure she's fine.
She's in DC.

01:27:19.772 --> 01:27:22.650
The blast radius wasn't that...

01:27:23.984 --> 01:27:25.986
...it wasn't that wide.

01:27:29.865 --> 01:27:31.909
Sir, listen to me.

01:27:32.868 --> 01:27:35.830
The plutonium was ours.

01:27:36.705 --> 01:27:41.919
John Clark's in Haifa to track down
the arms dealer. I can't get hold of him.

01:27:42.128 --> 01:27:44.421
I don't know what to do.

01:27:47.508 --> 01:27:50.386
Girl... girlfriend.

01:27:52.721 --> 01:27:54.181
She...

01:27:54.932 --> 01:27:57.852
She works in Baltimore, so...

01:27:58.060 --> 01:27:59.854
...I don't know.

01:28:03.107 --> 01:28:04.525
Spinnaker.

01:28:04.733 --> 01:28:07.695
- What?
- Spinnaker.

01:28:12.199 --> 01:28:13.534
Sir?

01:28:15.411 --> 01:28:16.745
Bill?

01:28:49.570 --> 01:28:52.781
Yeah. We found the receiver address
for the crate.

01:28:52.990 --> 01:28:56.368
Port of Baltimore.
Can you get to the docks?

01:28:56.577 --> 01:29:00.873
Find the Transcon warehouse.
The name on the manifest is Mason.

01:29:01.665 --> 01:29:03.751
Sorry, I need this truck.

01:29:38.536 --> 01:29:39.870
Come on.

01:30:17.241 --> 01:30:18.576
Shit.

01:31:22.973 --> 01:31:26.060
Sir, we've come up
with another alternative.

01:31:26.268 --> 01:31:31.398
A conventional attack on the airbase
where the carrier attack originated.

01:31:31.607 --> 01:31:35.402
- It's a measured response.
- Non-nuclear.

01:31:35.611 --> 01:31:39.573
- Is it strong enough?
- Smart bombs and F-16s.

01:31:39.782 --> 01:31:42.493
Can't afford for them to see us as weak.

01:31:42.701 --> 01:31:46.622
They've got to know we have the guts
to take it to the next level.

01:31:47.456 --> 01:31:49.416
I think they'll get that message.

01:31:54.046 --> 01:31:55.506
Hit 'em.

01:32:08.853 --> 01:32:13.315
Eagles Nest, this is Eagle One.
We have target acquired. Target is lit.

01:32:28.497 --> 01:32:31.417
To make no response
is to invite a greater attack.

01:32:31.625 --> 01:32:35.588
American submarines from Norfolk
and Kings Bay are putting to sea.

01:32:35.796 --> 01:32:41.302
They carry Trident D3 missiles.
A first strike weapon.

01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:44.054
Fowler is not so insane
as to launch a first strike.

01:32:44.263 --> 01:32:46.348
Perhaps he doesn't think
it's the first strike.

01:32:46.557 --> 01:32:50.478
Once their Stealth bombers go up,
we will have no choice.

01:32:50.686 --> 01:32:52.521
That will be the sign.

01:32:52.730 --> 01:32:55.107
How do we convince him
not to launch his bombers?

01:32:55.316 --> 01:33:00.529
- Maybe we should...
- Bring our missiles to highest alert.

01:33:00.738 --> 01:33:04.283
They'd be crazy to attack then.

01:33:06.035 --> 01:33:08.204
Can I have your attention?

01:33:08.412 --> 01:33:11.040
The generator has gone out.

01:33:11.248 --> 01:33:16.170
There's broken glass everywhere. Stay
where you are. We will get back to...

01:33:16.378 --> 01:33:20.382
OK, fine. Please, stay where you are.
We'll get you one by one.

01:33:33.938 --> 01:33:38.526
Sir, can you hear me?
Can you feel your arms and legs?

01:33:38.734 --> 01:33:42.947
A 9% IV and morphine drip.
Sir, we're gonna take care of you.

01:33:43.155 --> 01:33:45.115
What have you got?

01:33:45.866 --> 01:33:49.912
What do we do with the ones
we know won't make it?

01:33:50.121 --> 01:33:51.872
Whatever we can.

01:33:59.046 --> 01:34:00.381
What?

01:34:01.132 --> 01:34:03.175
Bill Cabot died.

01:34:07.847 --> 01:34:09.807
I'm really sorry.

01:34:11.725 --> 01:34:13.894
This can't be happening.

01:34:29.785 --> 01:34:32.580
Sir, we have a call from Langley.

01:34:33.914 --> 01:34:35.666
Thank you.

01:34:38.002 --> 01:34:40.212
- Becker.
- This is Jack Ryan.

01:34:40.421 --> 01:34:42.631
Great. The Nemerov apologist.

01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:47.928
Sir, this bomb was not Nemerov.
I know this guy.

01:34:48.345 --> 01:34:51.557
You said that after Grozny.
Put it in your report.

01:34:51.765 --> 01:34:53.100
The plutonium...

01:35:07.615 --> 01:35:11.410
Seems unusual to find
radiation poisoning here.

01:35:11.619 --> 01:35:13.704
I have never seen such a thing.

01:35:13.913 --> 01:35:18.417
That is why we published the case
on the internet, to seek help.

01:35:18.626 --> 01:35:22.671
- How did he say it happened?
- He will not talk about it.

01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:35.893
Was anyone else exposed
to the materials that made you sick?

01:35:41.857 --> 01:35:44.985
Mr Ghazi, I'm not the police.

01:35:45.986 --> 01:35:50.157
I'm a physician. I assure you
anything you say stays between us.

01:35:56.789 --> 01:36:00.584
My friend and I find bomb.

01:36:02.586 --> 01:36:06.757
We sell to a man
who buys such things.

01:36:10.845 --> 01:36:13.013
Was it this man?

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:23.065
Other people may have come
in contact with that bomb.

01:36:24.233 --> 01:36:26.235
We must help them.

01:36:37.455 --> 01:36:41.709
I am... going to die?

01:36:41.917 --> 01:36:43.252
Yes?

01:36:47.548 --> 01:36:48.924
Yes.

01:37:01.812 --> 01:37:05.399
His name is Olson.

01:37:08.235 --> 01:37:10.863
He live in Damascus.

01:37:29.298 --> 01:37:32.134
Oh, yeah. We're getting it all.

01:37:33.928 --> 01:37:38.265
A nuclear strike on Colorado Springs
would take out NORAD.

01:37:38.474 --> 01:37:41.977
It would limit their ability
to launch a counter-attack.

01:37:42.186 --> 01:37:45.356
How many people live
in Colorado Springs?

01:37:46.482 --> 01:37:49.819
Three or four hundred thousand.

01:37:50.027 --> 01:37:53.906
Mr President, to use nuclear weapons
against the Americans...

01:37:54.114 --> 01:37:56.283
...would be to cross a threshold.

01:37:56.492 --> 01:38:02.957
They think we already have. Should
we now wait for them to annihilate us?

01:38:03.457 --> 01:38:08.045
I cannot stop what I did not start.

01:38:10.172 --> 01:38:13.300
Mr President, we need you
to initiate snapcount.

01:38:14.677 --> 01:38:16.137
What happens then?

01:38:16.345 --> 01:38:20.724
We prepare to take out their land-based
missiles with a nuclear strike,

01:38:20.933 --> 01:38:25.521
find and kill their subs, knock out
the planes they have on the ground

01:38:25.729 --> 01:38:30.192
and mobilise our fighters to destroy
the ones they already have in the air.

01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:32.987
What are our chances?

01:38:33.863 --> 01:38:35.531
David?

01:38:37.950 --> 01:38:41.829
Odds are we leave Nemerov
in a pretty pickle.

01:38:42.037 --> 01:38:45.666
He'll be left with, at best,
a few hundred nukes,

01:38:45.875 --> 01:38:48.169
the ones we can't find.

01:38:48.377 --> 01:38:53.257
Mostly the... smaller, more mobile,
less accurate kind.

01:38:53.466 --> 01:38:56.051
All those can do is target our cities.

01:38:56.260 --> 01:39:00.681
But he knows to an absolute certainty
that we will respond against his cities.

01:39:06.979 --> 01:39:10.191
I spent my entire adult life
wanting to be president.

01:39:13.569 --> 01:39:15.863
This is my presidency?

01:39:17.406 --> 01:39:22.411
Sir, I think he'll keep his 300 nukes as a
deterrent against any future aggressor.

01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:26.499
I think he'll push back from the table
and call it a night.

01:39:29.919 --> 01:39:34.006
I'm giving the order for snapcount.
Maximum readiness.

01:39:43.182 --> 01:39:48.854
Olson had wire payments of $45 million
from someone named Dressler.

01:39:49.063 --> 01:39:52.900
Dillon, find out who Dressler is.
Jack, I want you out of there.

01:39:53.108 --> 01:39:56.278
- I'm at the docks.
- Look for the name Dressler.

01:39:56.487 --> 01:40:00.282
No. Jack, get out. Dillon, call the
Baltimore PD, give them the address.

01:40:00.491 --> 01:40:03.285
- Wait for the cops.
- I'll call you back.

01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:30.164
Who's Dressler?

01:41:34.376 --> 01:41:36.587
Where is he, goddamn it?

01:41:36.796 --> 01:41:39.465
Where is Dressler?

01:41:39.715 --> 01:41:42.259
Police! Put your hands up!

01:41:42.468 --> 01:41:44.887
- Where's Dressler?
- Are you Jack Ryan?

01:41:45.095 --> 01:41:48.808
- Where's Dressler, goddamn it?
- Let him go!

01:41:49.016 --> 01:41:52.019
Where's Dressler? Where is he?

01:41:55.481 --> 01:41:58.025
Langley said you might need help.

01:41:58.234 --> 01:42:01.445
- I gotta get to the Pentagon.
- I think I can help you with that.

01:42:22.174 --> 01:42:23.926
Mr President.

01:42:24.135 --> 01:42:27.221
Their Stealth bombers
have left Aviano.

01:42:29.515 --> 01:42:32.518
That is the sign.

01:42:32.726 --> 01:42:36.063
Shoot them down.

01:42:40.109 --> 01:42:42.236
God protect us.

01:42:43.279 --> 01:42:46.949
Mr President, they're scrambling
their fighters. We're out of time.

01:42:50.619 --> 01:42:52.872
- Dave!
- He has a heart condition.

01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:54.957
- Get a doctor.
- Mr President.

01:42:55.166 --> 01:42:57.126
- Where's your nitro?
- I said get a doctor!

01:42:57.334 --> 01:43:00.588
- Mr President.
- Take him to my quarters.

01:43:01.130 --> 01:43:03.674
Colonel, bring in the launch codes.

01:43:20.649 --> 01:43:23.736
Dressler's an Austrian manufacturer,
billionaire.

01:43:23.944 --> 01:43:26.447
His father was executed at Nuremberg.

01:43:26.655 --> 01:43:31.202
He bought a seat in parliament and got
booted out for saying pro-Nazi things.

01:43:31.410 --> 01:43:32.953
Rudy, get me through to the President.

01:43:33.162 --> 01:43:36.415
I can't do it, Jack.
They're in the snapcount.

01:43:36.624 --> 01:43:38.584
- There's no way in.
- Bullshit.

01:44:14.537 --> 01:44:18.582
- I can do that for you, sir.
- No, it's fine. Got some dirt on it.

01:44:18.791 --> 01:44:21.627
- Can I see it? We're on high alert.
- I understand.

01:44:21.836 --> 01:44:24.547
- Sir, put the card down.
- Back off.

01:44:24.755 --> 01:44:27.049
- I am ordering you...
- Back off!

01:44:27.258 --> 01:44:32.304
Step back now! I am ordering
you to take a step back! Put...

01:44:43.858 --> 01:44:46.402
General, there's a Dr Ryan
from the CIA.

01:44:46.610 --> 01:44:49.155
He wants to enter NMCC.
He's unescorted.

01:44:49.363 --> 01:44:51.365
- What's he want?
- You, sir.

01:44:51.574 --> 01:44:57.455
I have a message from Director Cabot
that I need to transmit over the hotline.

01:44:57.663 --> 01:45:00.207
- What's your authorisation?
- I don't have one.

01:45:00.416 --> 01:45:03.043
- Where's Cabot?
- Cabot's dead, sir.

01:45:03.252 --> 01:45:08.048
- I need to get this information sent.
- Not without authorisation. Get him out.

01:45:08.257 --> 01:45:13.846
Wait! General! The President is basing
his decisions on bad information!

01:45:14.054 --> 01:45:17.266
If you shut me out,
your family and my family

01:45:17.475 --> 01:45:21.437
and 25 million other families
will be dead in 30 minutes.

01:45:27.651 --> 01:45:31.989
My orders are to get this information
to the people who make the decisions.

01:45:32.198 --> 01:45:35.284
I just need to send some information.

01:45:36.869 --> 01:45:39.413
What makes you think
the President will listen to you?

01:45:43.375 --> 01:45:45.377
He doesn't have to.

01:45:45.753 --> 01:45:47.922
How close are the bombers?

01:45:48.839 --> 01:45:54.929
They're slipping in and out of radar
over Poland.

01:45:58.974 --> 01:46:03.729
Activate the missile regiments.

01:46:10.986 --> 01:46:14.657
The launch sequence takes a minute
to process after you give the order.

01:46:14.865 --> 01:46:18.994
Before the order can be taken,
an ID check must be performed.

01:46:24.125 --> 01:46:27.753
Mine is the... My number is...

01:46:28.879 --> 01:46:31.757
...the third one... third number down
from the top.

01:46:32.508 --> 01:46:34.635
Your orders, sir?

01:46:34.844 --> 01:46:37.304
- Strike.
- I'm sorry, sir?

01:46:37.513 --> 01:46:39.932
I give the order to strike.

01:46:40.141 --> 01:46:44.478
Under the two-man rule, the order
to strike must now be confirmed.

01:46:46.397 --> 01:46:48.858
Bob, for the love of God.

01:46:49.066 --> 01:46:50.860
Just do it.

01:46:55.906 --> 01:47:00.119
Sidney Owens, Secretary of State.
It's the fourth number down.

01:47:09.587 --> 01:47:12.923
The order to strike has now been
confirmed by the two-man rule.

01:47:13.132 --> 01:47:17.386
NMCC, strike order has been
confirmed. Start the sequence.

01:47:17.595 --> 01:47:20.347
- We've got activity on the hotline.
- They've had their chance.

01:47:20.556 --> 01:47:22.766
No, somebody's talking to the Kremlin.

01:47:28.522 --> 01:47:32.234
It says, "America has been the victim
of a terrorist attack."

01:47:32.526 --> 01:47:36.989
As you can imagine, there has
been much confusion here...

01:47:37.573 --> 01:47:39.366
...and fear.

01:47:39.575 --> 01:47:42.661
But we know the weapon
was not Russian.

01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:46.248
"But we know the weapon
was not Russian."

01:47:46.457 --> 01:47:48.042
What the hell is going on?

01:47:55.424 --> 01:47:58.177
Type exactly what I say.

01:47:58.385 --> 01:48:01.055
Who are we talking to?

01:48:03.724 --> 01:48:09.396
Ryan. I met you in Moscow with
Bill Cabot. He died today in Baltimore.

01:48:09.605 --> 01:48:12.650
- Cut him off.
- Launch sequence has begun.

01:48:12.858 --> 01:48:14.360
Two months ago,

01:48:14.610 --> 01:48:18.239
a neo-fascist named Dressler bought
an A-bomb on the black market.

01:48:18.447 --> 01:48:22.076
- Cut him off.
- The system can't be cut off.

01:48:22.284 --> 01:48:24.328
Then get someone to stop him.

01:48:24.537 --> 01:48:28.791
- He paid three disaffected Russian...
- "scientists to make the bomb active."

01:48:28.999 --> 01:48:31.919
"He shipped it to the US,
where a man named Mason"

01:48:32.128 --> 01:48:36.715
was hired to deliver the bomb and
set our countries on a collision course.

01:48:37.091 --> 01:48:41.262
This is madness. He is CIA.

01:48:41.470 --> 01:48:44.682
We cannot hang our fate
on the word of their spy.

01:48:44.890 --> 01:48:48.853
What is the harm of listening
a bit more?

01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:55.609
What are you asking of me?

01:49:04.535 --> 01:49:05.870
Back down.

01:49:10.374 --> 01:49:14.086
What guarantee do I have that
President Fowler will follow suit?

01:49:15.421 --> 01:49:16.964
None.

01:49:20.009 --> 01:49:23.304
You see? He is wasting time.

01:49:23.512 --> 01:49:25.764
We must launch now.
We have only moments.

01:49:28.184 --> 01:49:32.396
Sir, I know you had nothing to do
with the Baltimore bomb

01:49:32.605 --> 01:49:37.067
and you know you didn't, but you're
still about to launch a nuclear strike.

01:49:37.276 --> 01:49:40.613
- Yes, sir. That's all, Dr Ryan.
- This is about fear.

01:49:40.821 --> 01:49:43.032
Fear of your missiles,
fear of our subs.

01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:45.201
Fear of being weak,
of making a mistake,

01:49:45.409 --> 01:49:49.580
the fear of the other guy that had us
build these bombs in the first place!

01:49:52.958 --> 01:49:54.335
It stopped.

01:49:57.171 --> 01:49:58.714
They cut him off.

01:49:59.715 --> 01:50:01.175
They are going to strike.

01:50:01.383 --> 01:50:04.470
Prepare the launch orders now.

01:50:19.151 --> 01:50:20.903
30 seconds to launch.

01:50:21.111 --> 01:50:23.280
Oh, my God. Mr President?

01:50:33.124 --> 01:50:36.377
We will maintain our defensive alert
for the moment,

01:50:36.585 --> 01:50:39.338
but our offensive forces
are withdrawn.

01:50:39.547 --> 01:50:44.218
"If you match this, I propose a phased
mutual stand down over five hours."

01:50:46.303 --> 01:50:48.347
Stop the launch sequence.

01:50:48.556 --> 01:50:52.268
Lasseter here. Flash override.
Stop the sequence!

01:50:53.352 --> 01:50:56.981
Order the planes to stand down.
Take us to DEFCON-3.

01:50:57.189 --> 01:51:01.152
And would somebody ask Mr Ryan
if I can use the phone now?

01:51:30.973 --> 01:51:32.975
You're still here.

01:54:44.959 --> 01:54:49.338
There is no more fitting memorial
for those who perished in this tragedy

01:54:49.547 --> 01:54:51.757
than the steps we've taken this week

01:54:51.966 --> 01:54:53.968
toward a multinational campaign

01:54:54.176 --> 01:54:58.264
to root out and eliminate
weapons of mass destruction.

01:54:59.557 --> 01:55:04.979
We embarked on this course because
we have learned, at too great a cost,

01:55:05.187 --> 01:55:08.524
that if the most powerful weapons
ever created are unleashed,

01:55:08.732 --> 01:55:12.653
they will be fired not in anger,
but in fear.

01:55:12.862 --> 01:55:14.196
Dr Ryan.

01:55:15.573 --> 01:55:17.408
Mr Grushkov.

01:55:17.783 --> 01:55:21.454
It is... a lovely day.

01:55:23.330 --> 01:55:24.832
Yeah.

01:55:25.624 --> 01:55:30.129
- I'm sorry, this is...
- Dr Muller. How do you do?

01:55:31.213 --> 01:55:33.466
Nice to meet you.

01:55:35.092 --> 01:55:37.511
Why am I not surprised
you know her name?

01:55:39.763 --> 01:55:43.017
Our friend William thought
I was a spy.

01:55:43.225 --> 01:55:45.853
Of course, he could never prove it.

01:55:48.105 --> 01:55:49.857
He never told me you were friends.

01:55:51.025 --> 01:55:53.486
Maybe he didn't know you well enough.

01:55:56.155 --> 01:55:58.866
He told me he had a source in Russia.

01:56:01.202 --> 01:56:03.245
"To keep the back channels open?"

01:56:05.164 --> 01:56:07.249
"In hopes of staving off disaster."

01:56:07.458 --> 01:56:11.754
Kennedy said,
"Our most basic common link"

01:56:11.962 --> 01:56:15.716
"is that we all inhabit
this small planet."

01:56:17.301 --> 01:56:19.929
"We all breathe the same air."

01:56:20.596 --> 01:56:25.059
"We all cherish our children's future..."

01:56:25.601 --> 01:56:28.229
"...and we're all mortal."

01:56:29.104 --> 01:56:34.276
I will miss... so very much
talking to William.

01:56:36.237 --> 01:56:37.696
Me too.

01:56:38.614 --> 01:56:42.118
Perhaps from time to time

01:56:42.326 --> 01:56:44.954
you and I can talk.

01:56:45.162 --> 01:56:47.498
Yeah, I'd like that.

01:56:50.167 --> 01:56:51.544
What is this?

01:56:52.711 --> 01:56:56.590
A modest gift for your engagement.

01:56:58.843 --> 01:57:00.636
He just asked me this morning.

01:57:00.845 --> 01:57:03.556
We haven't told anybody about it.

01:57:04.807 --> 01:57:07.518
How could you possibly know?

01:57:08.305 --> 01:57:14.468
