WEBVTT

00:06.507 --> 00:09.634
All right, hold on.
I got the turn up here.

00:17.685 --> 00:20.353
Oh! How cool was that?

00:20.479 --> 00:22.230
That was way cool!

00:26.652 --> 00:29.070
- My turn.
- Sorry, that's not allowed.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.988
I just signed
15 pages of forms saying

00:31.115 --> 00:34.200
- you gotta rideon the back.
- I don't see any lawyers around.

00:34.326 --> 00:36.285
- You know that's not the point.
- No.

00:36.412 --> 00:39.288
You just wanna keep
all the fun to yourself.

00:40.332 --> 00:41.708
Come on, Dad!

00:42.835 --> 00:45.169
You go over 15,
we're pulling over, all right?
I mean it.

00:45.295 --> 00:47.630
- You're the best.
- All right, get on there.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.841
- Put on your goggles.
- Okay.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.802
- Ready?
- Got the clutch in?

00:52.928 --> 00:54.929
All right, that's my boy.

01:08.694 --> 01:11.487
Adam, you're going too fast,
slow it down!

01:14.658 --> 01:17.660
I mean it,
you're going too fast.
Slow down!

01:17.786 --> 01:25.334
Adam!

01:27.129 --> 01:29.005
Let go of the throttle!

01:33.302 --> 01:34.218
Adam!

01:34.678 --> 01:36.429
Adam! No!

02:11.799 --> 02:14.425
What've you got?
Sixteen-year-old, status post,

02:14.551 --> 02:16.344
ATV crash,
40% burns on his body.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.887
Nasotracheal intubation.

02:18.013 --> 02:19.889
Start a bag
of lactated Ringer's,
wide open...

02:20.015 --> 02:21.974
- Will he be okay?
- We'll be with you when we can.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.559
Get him out!

02:23.769 --> 02:25.561
Wait, wait, wait!

02:25.854 --> 02:28.731
I'll start fluids.
Let's go get him hooked up.

02:30.526 --> 02:31.984
Watch the line.

02:50.629 --> 02:53.673
- Been looking for you.
- Been avoiding you.

02:53.799 --> 02:54.882
Burn Unit can handle it.

02:55.008 --> 02:58.678
If they could handle it,
they wouldn't be asking for you.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.640
- Is that a journal?
- Friend wrote an article.

03:02.766 --> 03:03.933
In Hindi?

03:04.059 --> 03:07.311
They have a cutting-edge
neuroscience program in India.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.689
It says so right on the cover.

03:13.485 --> 03:15.653
Kid's heart rate's messed.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.947
Tachycardia
can be explained by the burn.

03:18.073 --> 03:20.575
I assume
the Burn Unit knew that.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.620
His potassium's low.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.622
Which can also be explained
by the burn.

03:26.748 --> 03:29.125
Except I'm sure the Burn Unit's
pumping him with fluids

03:29.251 --> 03:31.711
which means his potassium
should be going up, not down.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.504
Could be amphetamines.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.423
Or bacteria
lunching on his heart.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.676
Or cardiomyopathy,
or some other very bad thing.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.553
He needs an EKG.

03:47.519 --> 03:50.688
Okay, no skin, no EKG.

03:50.814 --> 03:53.065
Is he even
gonna survive the burn?

03:53.275 --> 03:55.443
What, you got
a date or something?

03:55.819 --> 03:58.029
Forty percent of his body.

03:58.155 --> 04:00.698
If the Burns Unit
can prevent an infection,

04:00.824 --> 04:02.700
his body will regenerate
maybe 10%,

04:02.826 --> 04:05.745
surgeons will do 20 or so grafts,
six months in this room,

04:05.871 --> 04:09.290
he'll end up with a series of nasty
scars, maybe some pain,

04:09.416 --> 04:10.625
but he'll live.

04:11.376 --> 04:12.627
Unless his heart shuts down

04:12.753 --> 04:17.465
'cause we can't figure out
what's causing the
low potassium and tachycardia.

04:18.216 --> 04:21.552
We need help from a Belgian doc
named Einthoven.

04:21.678 --> 04:22.970
He's dead.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.891
While he was alive, he invented a little
dittie called the Galvanometer.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.059
Where do we get one?

04:28.185 --> 04:31.854
Go to any electronics store
that's been open since before 1905.

04:31.980 --> 04:35.775
There's a good chance they've got one
in a corner in the basement.

04:37.152 --> 04:39.695
We need an audio-visual setup
for the lecture hall.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.697
- What for?
- For the lecture.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.158
- What lecture?
- Dr. Weber's lecture.

04:44.451 --> 04:47.870
- Who is Dr. Weber?
- A neurologist, I think.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.289
The memo was from you.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.798
- Where is my assistant?
- She left.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.091
- When?
- Wednesday.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.635
- Seriously?
- Well, the temp agency sent someone,

05:02.761 --> 05:03.803
but she got lost.

05:03.929 --> 05:06.514
Well, when she gets here,
fire her.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.828
Oh, yeah.

05:28.954 --> 05:31.580
- Did you issue this memo?
- Look at that.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.875
Congratulations.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.086
The patient
that has been in a coma
for two years and counting

05:37.212 --> 05:38.587
is still in a coma.

05:38.714 --> 05:40.047
This is not my signature.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.632
I don't know
anything about this guy.

05:41.758 --> 05:44.552
I'm supposed to introduce him?
Have lunch?

05:46.555 --> 05:49.390
- The coma patient has a migraine?
- Oh, no, no, no.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.642
No, I gave him medication
to prevent a migraine.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.310
That's a migraine.

05:53.437 --> 05:55.521
Increased flow velocity
in his cerebral arteries.

05:55.647 --> 05:58.441
I did subsequently
give him nitroglycerin,
which could possibly...

05:58.567 --> 06:02.528
You induced
a migraine headache
in a coma patient?

06:02.654 --> 06:06.449
I gave him a little headache,
similar to the one
you're giving me now.

06:06.575 --> 06:08.993
Have you even read
an ethical guideline?

06:09.119 --> 06:12.038
Well, it would be wrong
to try out a new
migraine prevention medication

06:12.164 --> 06:14.415
on someone
who can actually feel pain.

06:14.541 --> 06:17.626
- Did you sign this?
- Yeah.

06:18.920 --> 06:22.381
We can talk later about
the appropriate discipline.

06:25.719 --> 06:26.844
Because of the burn,

06:26.970 --> 06:29.513
we can't perform
any of our normal tests
to see what's wrong.

06:29.639 --> 06:32.099
So we're going to try
a Galvanometer.

06:32.684 --> 06:35.895
It picks up a pulse
in the wrists and the ankles.

06:36.313 --> 06:39.565
Hopefully it'll tell us
why his heart rhythm
is abnormal.

06:39.691 --> 06:42.735
- What have I done to him? I...
- It was an accident.

06:43.612 --> 06:45.112
All right? So...

06:46.031 --> 06:47.448
He's got all these burns

06:47.574 --> 06:49.533
and now
there's something wrong
with his heart?

06:49.659 --> 06:52.578
We're trying to figure out
if the two
are somehow connected.

06:52.704 --> 06:55.664
- Had he been sick lately?
- No, nothing.

06:55.791 --> 06:57.291
Anything unusual
with his behavior?

06:57.417 --> 06:59.001
- Had he been tired a lot?
- Nothing.

06:59.127 --> 07:03.339
He was great, he was happy,
he was just having
a great time, and then...

07:03.465 --> 07:06.967
If he was experimenting
with amphetamines
or cocaine...

07:07.094 --> 07:08.135
No.

07:08.678 --> 07:11.597
We gave him some pot
about a year ago, to try...

07:11.723 --> 07:13.099
It was just once.

07:13.225 --> 07:15.643
We thought
if we took the mystery
out of drugs and alcohol,

07:15.769 --> 07:17.144
the less he'd experiment.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.647
We'll know more
after the tests.

07:21.525 --> 07:24.443
It looks like
they're gonna electrocute him.

07:25.695 --> 07:26.946
Plug it in.

07:28.573 --> 07:29.990
You plug it in.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.618
Fine. Give me the cord.

07:39.501 --> 07:40.543
Works.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.630
Prominent U waves.

07:44.756 --> 07:47.591
No inverted T wave.
No ischemia.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.385
Q wave normal.

07:50.262 --> 07:51.804
That's not good.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.852
Okay, turn it off.
Turn it off!

07:57.978 --> 07:59.854
- What's happening?
- What is that?

07:59.980 --> 08:01.313
The seizure's
getting...

08:01.439 --> 08:03.107
Can't you stop that?

08:10.282 --> 08:11.949
Who electrocuted my patient?

08:12.075 --> 08:13.951
- He had a seizure.
- He wasn't electrocuted.

08:14.077 --> 08:16.620
What does the seizure tell us?
Move.

08:16.746 --> 08:17.997
What are you looking for?

08:18.123 --> 08:21.792
Same as you are, love,
acceptance,
solid return on an investment.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.377
Differential diagnosis. Go.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.337
Could be epilepsy
or seizure disorder.

08:25.463 --> 08:28.883
Not with the tachycardia.
It could be
a virus in his brain.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.093
Your specificity's impressive.

08:31.219 --> 08:32.845
Adrenoleukodystrophy.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.054
Could be MS.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.974
The seizures could be caused
by plaques
and lesions on the brain.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.602
Well, let's find out which.
Get him an MRI.

08:39.728 --> 08:41.395
No nuclear imaging!

08:43.106 --> 08:47.484
He wouldn't survive
the move to Radiology.
MRI and CT scan are both out.

08:47.611 --> 08:50.863
Okay, lumbar puncture
will tell us
if his proteins are elevated,

08:50.989 --> 08:52.114
at least we can exclude MS.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.241
We can't do
a lumbar puncture either.

08:56.077 --> 08:58.162
You're cramping my exits.

08:58.288 --> 09:00.039
Don't tell me,
no skin on his spine.

09:00.165 --> 09:03.125
We'd be inserting a needle
into an area
that's teeming with bacteria.

09:03.251 --> 09:06.003
If he doesn't have
a brain infection already,
we'd give him one for sure.

09:06.129 --> 09:08.756
There's no other way
to look at a brain.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.926
Transcranial
Doppler Sonography.

09:12.052 --> 09:15.221
She said "brain",
not "pregnant woman's uterus."

09:15.347 --> 09:18.015
They do sound alike.
I used one to look at a brain
this morning.

09:18.141 --> 09:20.684
Why didn't you take
the patient to Radiology,
get an MRA?

09:20.810 --> 09:22.895
Obviously
I was doing something illegal.

09:23.021 --> 09:25.314
Using nuclear imaging
would have raised questions.

09:25.440 --> 09:28.150
You're not gonna get
a diagnosis of MS
from a sonogram.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.319
Not definitively,
but patients with MS

09:30.445 --> 09:33.280
have more reactive neurons
in their occipital cortex.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.452
Okay then.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.500
Thank you for all coming
to today's lecture

09:44.626 --> 09:46.669
by Dr. Phillip Weber,

09:47.212 --> 09:49.755
who is our guest today
at our hospital

09:49.881 --> 09:53.259
to talk about headaches.

09:54.427 --> 09:58.347
Dr. Weber is at
the Weber Center for Pain,
that makes sense.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.350
Weber, Weber.
So please welcome Dr. Weber!

10:08.900 --> 10:11.986
Thank you Dr. Cuddy.

10:14.281 --> 10:17.908
I suppose I should tell you
a little bit more
about myself.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.995
I went to school in Virginia.

10:21.997 --> 10:23.998
You've never been
to one of these things
in your life.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.500
- Who is this guy?
- No idea.

10:27.919 --> 10:29.795
What's with the outfit?

10:30.338 --> 10:33.090
Sudden chills
and light sensitivity.

10:33.341 --> 10:34.925
Inexplicable.

10:35.719 --> 10:39.221
I received my medical degree
at Johns Hopkins University,

10:39.764 --> 10:42.683
where I studied under
Brightman and Gilmar...

10:42.809 --> 10:44.560
Hmm. He must be good.

10:44.686 --> 10:47.688
You went to Hopkins,
and studied
under Brightman and Gilmar.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.273
Shh.

10:49.399 --> 10:52.609
...helped me win
the Doyle Internship
at the Mayo Clinic.

10:52.736 --> 10:55.696
You were supposed
to get the Doyle Internship.

10:58.241 --> 11:01.827
This guy's Von Lieberman?
The guy who got you
thrown out for cheating?

11:01.953 --> 11:05.581
The dean threw me out.
Von Lieberman
just ratted on me.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.958
This guy's name is Weber,
not Von Lieberman.

11:08.084 --> 11:11.295
I call Weber Von Lieberman,
way eviler.

11:11.713 --> 11:12.713
Shh.

11:13.757 --> 11:17.885
...1D receptors have improved
the acute treatment
of migraines,

11:18.720 --> 11:20.429
to this point...

11:20.555 --> 11:21.972
So what's the plan?

11:22.098 --> 11:25.517
You gonna wait
until he bends over
and make a fart sound?

11:25.810 --> 11:29.688
I'm not here about the past.
He's a bad scientist.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.734
Well, you cheated off him,
how bad can he be?

11:35.320 --> 11:37.279
He got the answer wrong.

11:44.996 --> 11:46.580
Are they trying
to wake him up?

11:46.706 --> 11:48.957
They can't do that, right?
He'll be in too much pain.

11:49.084 --> 11:51.418
Don't worry, he's still under.

11:51.544 --> 11:54.588
But the brain
never completely sleeps,
it's always working.

11:54.714 --> 11:58.300
Controlling your heart rate,
breathing, temperature.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.387
The eyes
respond to visual stimuli.

12:01.513 --> 12:03.430
Blood flow increases
in certain areas of the brain

12:03.556 --> 12:06.141
and we can track that
with a sonogram.

12:06.267 --> 12:10.562
With MS, blood vessels
are more reactive,
so flow is faster.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.898
If Adam has an infection,

12:13.108 --> 12:15.401
there'd be swelling,
which would
constrict the arteries.

12:15.527 --> 12:17.778
And the flow would be slower.

12:17.904 --> 12:20.656
Chase.
Near the subarachnoid space.

12:27.038 --> 12:31.083
Data from
control subjects were analyzed
of a two-way ANOVA

12:31.209 --> 12:34.294
with status and side
as within-subject factors.

12:35.672 --> 12:39.299
You stalked this guy
for 20 years just for
this shot to humiliate him?

12:39.426 --> 12:41.343
I'm trying to learn.

12:41.469 --> 12:43.846
...vessels without
significant rebound...

12:43.972 --> 12:46.515
He doesn't even know
what that means.

12:46.641 --> 12:48.183
You're gonna interrupt him,
aren't you?

12:48.309 --> 12:49.810
If I have a question.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.854
And what's that
gonna accomplish?

12:51.980 --> 12:55.649
Why can't you just enjoy this?
Why can't you just
be happy for me?

12:55.775 --> 13:00.154
You have got to find
less debilitating outlets
than humiliating people.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.615
I hear bowling is more fun
than stalking.

13:04.367 --> 13:05.742
But I'm better at this.

13:05.869 --> 13:08.412
...if "P" is less than
point-zero...

13:08.538 --> 13:10.873
Blow a ton of money
on a plasma TV.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.418
We found a subarachnoid bleed.

13:15.837 --> 13:18.422
Bleed in the head
isn't causing seizures.

13:18.548 --> 13:21.633
It could be. 10% with damage
to cerebral cortex
have a seizure.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.427
Or bacterial meningitis.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.554
- Viral encephalitis?
- There's no way to tell without...

13:25.680 --> 13:26.930
Shut up!

13:28.183 --> 13:29.433
Excuse me.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.102
Not you.

13:32.228 --> 13:35.772
You know, if my lecture
is interrupting your meeting,
I can wait.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.778
As your people say in India.
Appreciate it.

13:41.905 --> 13:45.574
We'll figure out why later.
Fix the bleed or he dies.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.701
Talk to you in a couple hours.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.967
I'm in the subarachnoid space.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.179
- Can you get it?
- Think so.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.642
Put the probe
back where it was
so I can see the wire!

14:11.768 --> 14:12.851
We're looking for the bleed
in...

14:12.977 --> 14:17.105
Look when I get there,
I'm flying blind
without a contrast CT here!

14:26.157 --> 14:30.619
...and with a p-value
of less than 0.001,

14:31.037 --> 14:35.249
we have strong statistical
evidence that this drug
prevents migraine headaches

14:35.375 --> 14:37.793
without daily administration.

14:38.336 --> 14:40.045
Excuse me, Doctor.

14:40.171 --> 14:41.713
He knows his field
better than you do.

14:41.839 --> 14:45.759
It's always been
my understanding that, unless
you follow a daily regimen,

14:45.885 --> 14:47.886
no drug
can prevent a migraine.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.846
That's why they call it
a breakthrough.

14:49.973 --> 14:52.182
That's why
you call it a breakthrough.

14:52.308 --> 14:55.394
No, the pharmaceutical company
sponsoring my clinical trials

14:55.520 --> 14:57.771
also hails it
as a breakthrough.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.399
I'm sure your wife
and lawyer do, too.

15:01.776 --> 15:04.152
Is there anybody
who doesn't stand
to make a fortune from it

15:04.279 --> 15:05.571
calling it a breakthrough?

15:05.697 --> 15:06.863
Who are you?

15:06.990 --> 15:09.324
Just a lunatic
who desperately needs a hobby.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.410
How exactly
do these studies work?

15:11.536 --> 15:13.412
Do you give this drug
to a bunch of people,

15:13.538 --> 15:17.291
and if they don't
get a migraine, you go,
"Voilà, my drug works"?

15:17.417 --> 15:18.875
Excuse me, miss?

15:19.335 --> 15:21.044
Do you have cancer?

15:22.505 --> 15:25.465
Wow! Mango juice
prevents cancer.

15:26.050 --> 15:29.303
Perhaps I should have
taken my medication
before this lecture.

15:31.264 --> 15:35.684
We had
a very specific control group,
chronic migraine sufferers.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.936
I don't have time
to go through
all the math right now,

15:38.062 --> 15:41.356
- but the incidence was dramatically...
- Sure, in India.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.693
Two plus two
equals five there, right?

15:45.695 --> 15:47.029
Do I know you?

15:47.155 --> 15:50.616
I know your math skills.
They blow.

15:51.326 --> 15:52.326
Touché.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.286
You sound very familiar.

15:54.412 --> 15:57.205
Why did you publish it
in an obscure journal
in India?

15:57.332 --> 16:02.002
Why not publish it
in really, really cool
head cases of South Philly?

16:02.128 --> 16:04.713
Neuroscience New Delhi
is a respected journal.

16:04.839 --> 16:08.383
Yeah.
The guy running Slurp N' Gulp
tells me it's one of the best.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.385
Get a hooker, anything.

16:10.511 --> 16:14.222
See, I'm thinking
that publishing studies
is probably the easiest way

16:14.349 --> 16:16.850
to get
a pharmaceutical company
to give you a reach-around.

16:16.976 --> 16:20.062
And choosing a journal
that no one can actually read,
well, that's...

16:20.188 --> 16:21.396
That's shrewd.

16:21.522 --> 16:25.192
- I know I know you.
- Sure you do, Dick.

16:25.526 --> 16:26.610
The name's Philip.

16:26.736 --> 16:29.821
My bad. Something to do
with your face.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.199
I always think
your name is Dick.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.284
- House?
- Here.

16:36.204 --> 16:39.998
Medical school
was 20 years ago.
Give it a rest. Grow up.

16:40.124 --> 16:44.795
Yeah. You were always
the grown-up. Do the
responsible thing, tattletale!

16:45.380 --> 16:48.382
- You cheated!
- I cheated then, you're cheating now!

16:48.508 --> 16:49.341
Your drug doesn't work.

16:49.467 --> 16:53.011
Oh, yes, you would like to
believe that because it plays
right into your fantasy...

16:53.137 --> 16:55.097
- I tested it.
- Oh, really?

16:55.264 --> 16:58.433
What are your parameters?
Where's your study?

17:00.812 --> 17:02.396
Room 2134.

17:02.772 --> 17:05.148
- One patient?
- The coma patient?

17:06.484 --> 17:08.276
You haven't changed a bit.

17:09.237 --> 17:13.073
You took shortcuts
in med school,
you're taking shortcuts now.

17:13.324 --> 17:16.410
You cannot test this
on an abnormal brain.

17:16.536 --> 17:20.539
That's so close-minded.
He's not abnormal,
he's special.

17:20.665 --> 17:24.167
Cerebral cortex
atrophies in coma patients.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.630
You need live,
conscious people.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.761
You don't know everything,
House!

17:38.808 --> 17:41.476
Something
that disrupts brain function.

17:41.811 --> 17:45.355
Plaques are perfect.
Interrupt
neuronal communication.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.607
- MS?
- No, MS is complicated.

17:47.734 --> 17:51.486
I think this is more basic.
It's just tachycardia
and seizures.

17:51.612 --> 17:54.656
How much longer
the Burn Unit guys
gonna keep him in that thing?

17:54.782 --> 17:57.617
Lecture's over, let's go.
House wants to...

18:00.496 --> 18:02.414
Adam's waking up.

18:02.665 --> 18:04.416
Get the anesthesiologist
in here now.

18:04.542 --> 18:05.876
He's in pain.

18:07.378 --> 18:09.463
That's not pain.

18:10.131 --> 18:12.048
Need some help in here!

19:13.986 --> 19:15.695
Adam had an orgasm.

19:17.448 --> 19:20.450
What? You mean,
while he was sedated...

19:26.874 --> 19:28.458
What's wrong?

19:29.919 --> 19:31.878
I'm having a migraine.

19:32.380 --> 19:33.713
Are you okay?

19:35.091 --> 19:36.216
Yes.

19:37.927 --> 19:39.219
I was right.

19:51.399 --> 19:53.316
I'm gonna knock you out
for a couple of hours.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.402
No, I got work to do.

19:55.611 --> 19:58.405
Just give me sumatriptan
for the pain

19:58.531 --> 20:01.116
and verapamil
so it doesn't recur.

20:04.704 --> 20:08.456
I heard the patient had fun
in the hyperbaric chamber.

20:08.583 --> 20:09.457
Yeah.

20:09.584 --> 20:12.294
Gotta schedule me
some time in there.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.674
Weber's meds
aren't even legal in the U.S.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.676
It's legal in India.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.846
I was disoriented.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.937
Moving around is a bad idea.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.982
Hey, if you feel chest pain,
you need to let me know.

20:34.108 --> 20:36.985
Verapamil can cause
congestive heart failure.

20:37.153 --> 20:39.195
Nothing can hurt my heart.

20:42.325 --> 20:46.494
Hey, you're gonna feel
some dizziness. Definitely
gonna be constipated.

20:51.208 --> 20:55.003
Differential diagnosis
for getting off.

20:55.755 --> 20:56.588
Is he gonna be okay?

20:56.714 --> 20:59.215
No. Something's seriously wrong
with him.

20:59.342 --> 21:03.845
Differential diagnosis
for ejaculation.

21:06.307 --> 21:07.849
Don't make me say it again.

21:07.975 --> 21:10.143
We're not stalling,
we just don't know.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.436
Then guess.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.856
- Could pain medication cause an orgasm?
- I wish.

21:14.982 --> 21:16.900
Maybe pain caused the orgasm.

21:17.026 --> 21:20.278
You get a tattoo,
the brain releases endorphins
which create pleasure.

21:20.404 --> 21:23.073
Most people don't orgasm
from a needle prick.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.991
Well,
Chase has a point.

21:25.117 --> 21:28.703
The brain
is like a huge train station,
if the switches...

21:32.083 --> 21:34.042
You're the neurologist,
talk for me.

21:34.168 --> 21:38.254
If sensory information
got misinterpreted by
the medial forebrain bundle,

21:38.381 --> 21:41.257
it's possible
for bad to feel good,
and good to feel bad.

21:41.384 --> 21:44.928
He's a lucky kid.
Let's not fix him
until the burns heal.

21:45.054 --> 21:47.097
So what attacks
the medial forebrain bundle?

21:47.223 --> 21:49.265
Infective neuropathies,
vasculitic neuropathies...

21:49.392 --> 21:51.518
Krabbe's disease,
metachromatic leukodystrophy.

21:51.644 --> 21:54.270
All very bad things.

21:54.397 --> 21:57.148
No way to look for any of them
in his condition.

21:57.274 --> 21:58.441
Could be an infection.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.110
I said infection
about eight seconds ago.

22:00.236 --> 22:02.237
You listed
some brain infections.

22:02.363 --> 22:06.950
But what if it's just
a regular old infection
festering in the burned skin?

22:07.076 --> 22:09.452
Pus on his arm
isn't causing problems
in the forebrain.

22:09.578 --> 22:13.248
He's on
20 different medications
to manage his pain, his heart,

22:13.374 --> 22:14.916
how often he urinates.

22:15.042 --> 22:17.544
His brain is like a waiter
that's got too many...

22:17.670 --> 22:20.296
Hey, hey. I do the metaphors.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.092
The brain is stressed.

22:24.218 --> 22:26.177
An infection elsewhere
could put it over the edge.

22:26.303 --> 22:29.389
So we just wait
for his burns to heal
to see if you're right?

22:29.515 --> 22:32.809
If you're wrong,
he doesn't have
that kind of time.

22:34.103 --> 22:35.812
Dominic Larrey.

22:36.647 --> 22:38.690
He another dead doctor?

22:38.816 --> 22:41.359
He's Napoleon's
Surgeon in Chief.

22:41.485 --> 22:43.153
Cleaned
a lot of battle wounds.

22:43.279 --> 22:44.487
By amputating legs.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.156
And with bugs.

22:51.120 --> 22:54.122
Maggots are implanted
directly into Adam's burns.

22:55.166 --> 22:58.168
Maggots, they eat dead people,
I...

22:58.294 --> 23:01.588
Maggots eat dead flesh.
Only dead flesh.

23:02.256 --> 23:05.258
So they're perfectly suited
to clean wounds.

23:06.093 --> 23:09.304
They also kill the bacteria
that thrive
in injured tissues.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.384
Dr. Jekyll, I presume.

23:48.511 --> 23:52.305
They found a half-eaten sheep
in the zoo. The police
wanna ask you a few questions.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.890
I need something
to wash it down.

23:54.016 --> 23:56.059
Coffee? Bad idea.

23:56.185 --> 23:59.270
- You're better off with water!
- Coffee's closer.

24:01.232 --> 24:03.191
Foolproof plan, by the way.

24:03.317 --> 24:05.026
Either his meds would work,

24:05.152 --> 24:09.656
and you'd be in psychic pain
because Von Evil
is gonna be rich.

24:10.699 --> 24:14.327
Or they wouldn't,
and you get
to be in agony all day.

24:15.496 --> 24:18.456
Perfect lose-lose situation.
Very you.

24:18.582 --> 24:21.334
- I had to prove...
- You've proved nothing.

24:23.963 --> 24:26.798
Right. This isn't a migraine.

24:27.550 --> 24:29.717
Yeah. "Dear New England
Journal of Medicine,

24:29.844 --> 24:32.428
I took this guy's drug
and still got a headache.

24:32.555 --> 24:36.349
Thus, scientifically proving
that my arch enemy
is an idiot."

24:36.475 --> 24:37.600
You just wanted the pain.

24:37.726 --> 24:41.312
Meds are supposed
to prevent migraine.

24:41.438 --> 24:42.939
You get distracted by pain.

24:43.065 --> 24:45.733
Leaves less room
for the things
you don't wanna think about.

24:45.860 --> 24:49.195
Like the Flyers sucking,
or the price of gas,

24:49.363 --> 24:52.615
or the fact that you pushed
the love of your life
out of your life.

24:52.741 --> 24:55.451
God, I wish the pain
would go away.

24:55.870 --> 24:58.663
Next time you need
to get your mind off her,
stick a needle in your eye.

24:58.789 --> 25:02.584
It's less annoying
to the rest of us
when you can still walk.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.467
Did you sleep here?

25:15.389 --> 25:16.347
Lower.

25:17.266 --> 25:18.975
Do you want a pillow?

25:19.977 --> 25:21.561
Not softer, lower.

25:22.313 --> 25:24.814
Frequency of your voice
is grating.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.566
You should've been better
by now.

25:26.692 --> 25:28.318
I'm super.

25:28.569 --> 25:29.944
Patient?

25:30.362 --> 25:32.989
The maggots
did great for the burn.

25:33.407 --> 25:35.283
But the brain waves
are still all over the map.

25:35.409 --> 25:39.662
Which means your regular
old infection isn't causing
his brain dysfunction.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.581
Which means there's
an underlying condition,

25:41.707 --> 25:44.334
which means
we've gotta get
inside his head.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.419
Do a lumbar puncture.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.546
We've already established
that we can't get a lumbar...

25:48.672 --> 25:50.632
C2, C3.

25:50.758 --> 25:52.717
No. No. No way.

25:53.469 --> 25:56.804
I only saw
a cervical tap once,
and that guy got paralyzed.

25:56.931 --> 26:01.434
Ask the parents if they prefer
to have their son
in a wheelchair or dead.

26:05.856 --> 26:08.733
Something's causing his brain
to lose control.

26:08.859 --> 26:10.693
Eventually it'll shut off.

26:10.819 --> 26:12.445
We need to do
a lumbar puncture

26:12.571 --> 26:15.198
to get some of the fluid
in his spine
so we can test it.

26:15.324 --> 26:17.242
You need us to sign a consent?

26:17.368 --> 26:19.244
I have to warn you.

26:19.370 --> 26:22.330
There's a serious risk
of paralysis or death.

26:23.249 --> 26:24.999
Are you saying
we shouldn't do this?

26:25.584 --> 26:26.876
You have to do this.

26:27.002 --> 26:28.795
Then why are you telling us
what can go wrong?

26:28.921 --> 26:31.005
- I just think you should know...
- Either you're cruel

26:31.131 --> 26:32.966
or this clipboard is a way
for you to cover your ass,

26:33.092 --> 26:34.759
- in case you cripple our son.
- This isn't his fault.

26:34.885 --> 26:37.929
No, it's not.
It's yours, that's what
you keep telling me.

26:38.055 --> 26:39.555
My son is lying in there
half-dead,

26:39.682 --> 26:42.934
I am just trying to find a way
to get through this.

26:43.060 --> 26:45.186
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, I know.

27:05.249 --> 27:06.249
Needle.

27:21.682 --> 27:24.309
- It's not going in.
- Don't force it.

27:24.601 --> 27:25.893
I'm going one space higher.

27:26.020 --> 27:29.230
It's too close
to his brain stem,
it'll herniate.

27:29.356 --> 27:32.442
- You're gonna paralyze him.
- You're not helping.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.193
His blood pressure's spiking,
stop.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.361
I can get it.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.989
He's 180 over 120,
he's gonna stroke.

27:39.575 --> 27:42.201
I'm in the space.
Give me the vial.

27:59.595 --> 28:02.221
He doesn't have MS
or an infection.

28:04.183 --> 28:06.392
His proteins aren't elevated?

28:06.518 --> 28:09.312
Wrong protein. IgM, not IgG.

28:09.438 --> 28:12.273
Elevation was probably caused
by the bleed.

28:13.650 --> 28:17.695
What if there was tingling
in his extremities
prior to the crash?

28:18.489 --> 28:21.824
- How can you still be on MS?
- I gotta be on something.

28:22.409 --> 28:26.454
Something's interrupting
his neurons' chitchat,
like lesions.

28:26.580 --> 28:28.247
We can't scan for them.

28:28.374 --> 28:31.292
The only test we can do,
we just did
and it was negative.

28:31.418 --> 28:33.461
He has no tingling,
no numbness.

28:33.587 --> 28:36.130
And you read his history,
parents didn't say
anything about...

28:36.256 --> 28:37.715
What about Adam?

28:39.176 --> 28:43.054
We can't look into his brain,
but you want us
to read his mind?

28:43.972 --> 28:45.473
Good point.

28:54.691 --> 28:57.402
Yeah, you can finish
the sponge bath in a minute.

28:57.528 --> 29:00.696
They're just
re-doing his dressings.
He's out, he's fine.

29:00.823 --> 29:04.659
I didn't page you
to put him out.
I paged you to wake him up.

29:04.827 --> 29:07.286
Why are these lights
so damn bright?

29:07.871 --> 29:09.330
Thank you.

29:09.456 --> 29:11.416
Come on,
I need to talk to him.

29:11.542 --> 29:14.127
House, you can't wake up
a burn victim
to play twenty questions.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.170
- It's torture.
- He won't remember.

29:16.296 --> 29:18.840
- He's gonna be in extraordinary...
- God, you're good!

29:18.966 --> 29:20.675
You're putting me to sleep.

29:20.801 --> 29:24.220
I know he's gonna be in pain,
I know you disapprove.
I'm his attending.

29:24.346 --> 29:25.805
Wake him up.

29:45.451 --> 29:46.784
Oh, my God!

29:46.910 --> 29:49.287
- I'm Dr. House.
- It hurts!

29:49.455 --> 29:51.414
It's gonna get a lot worse,
so answer fast.

29:51.540 --> 29:56.377
Before the accident, did you
experience any numbness
or tingling in your fingers?

29:56.503 --> 29:58.838
You got burned, it's healing,
I need an answer.

29:58.964 --> 30:00.173
It really hurts!

30:00.299 --> 30:02.133
Any tingling
in your arms or legs?

30:02.259 --> 30:03.843
You gotta do something,
I can't...

30:03.969 --> 30:07.346
Adam, you gotta listen to me,
did you feel anything?

30:08.891 --> 30:13.352
I pissed in my pants
and then I don't remember...

30:52.726 --> 30:55.436
- Was he okay?
- Get everyone in my office.

30:56.563 --> 30:58.356
Where you going?

30:58.565 --> 31:02.527
Kid's screaming
gave me a headache.
I gotta take an aspirin.

32:01.461 --> 32:04.755
House, you okay?
We've been waiting for you.

32:09.386 --> 32:11.220
I'm hallucinating.

32:14.433 --> 32:17.685
Hallucinations with migraines
are pretty uncommon.

32:18.395 --> 32:21.731
- What did you see?
- I saw music.

32:23.650 --> 32:26.193
Sensory deception
makes no sense.

32:30.574 --> 32:32.283
You took something.

32:32.951 --> 32:35.411
The kid's
fighting for his life.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.734
Hey, you find him?

33:06.860 --> 33:08.944
He was hallucinating
in the locker room.

33:09.071 --> 33:10.279
He okay?

33:10.405 --> 33:12.114
He's feeling no pain,
he's high.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.574
Vicodin high?

33:13.700 --> 33:16.160
Past that. He's seeing sounds.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.204
Took something.

33:21.041 --> 33:23.626
Why is it so dark in here?
It's a beautiful day outside.

33:23.752 --> 33:26.253
Open the shades,
let the sun shine in.

33:26.380 --> 33:28.047
It's nighttime.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.802
- It's still Tuesday, right?
- You look better.

33:33.261 --> 33:35.805
- I took something.
- Mind if I ask what?

33:37.307 --> 33:39.392
Little of this,
little of that.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.477
I know
what's wrong with our patient.

33:41.603 --> 33:43.229
He's depressed.

33:43.355 --> 33:44.939
- He told you that when you woke him up?
- Nope.

33:45.065 --> 33:46.732
He told me he pissed his pants
and blacked out.

33:46.858 --> 33:50.069
That's not diagnostic of
depression. Lack of appetite,
isolating yourself.

33:50.195 --> 33:53.322
Uncontrollable urination
and blacking out
are good predictors of what?

33:53.448 --> 33:54.281
Seizure.

33:54.408 --> 33:56.867
Which means the seizure he had
when you tested his heart

33:56.993 --> 33:58.911
- was at least his second seizure.
- So what?

33:59.037 --> 34:00.579
Depression and seizures
aren't correlated.

34:00.706 --> 34:03.332
No, but you know what is?

34:03.458 --> 34:06.168
Depression
and anti-depression medicine.

34:06.294 --> 34:07.712
Tox screen was clean.

34:07.838 --> 34:10.047
Yeah, but you know
how much crap
he's got in his system

34:10.173 --> 34:11.340
for dealing with those burns.

34:11.466 --> 34:14.135
The guy could have
the Spanish Armada floating
through his bloodstream

34:14.261 --> 34:16.971
and we wouldn't know about it,
till they started
firing cannons.

34:17.097 --> 34:20.558
Antidepressants have been
known to cause seizures
in kids, but not orgasms.

34:20.684 --> 34:21.684
This is a brain in trouble.

34:21.810 --> 34:24.854
This is a brain
with too much serotonin.

34:24.980 --> 34:28.691
Serotonin affects mood,
appetite, it doesn't cause
the brain to shut down.

34:28.817 --> 34:31.944
Antidepressants fake brains
into thinking
they have more serotonin

34:32.070 --> 34:33.195
than they actually do.

34:33.321 --> 34:37.199
Every ten million or so cases
sets off a chain reaction.

34:37.325 --> 34:39.827
Produces too much,
enough to fry itself.

34:39.953 --> 34:42.371
If Adam has Serotonin Storm,
it's deadly.

34:42.497 --> 34:44.498
But treatable. Cyproheptadine.

34:44.624 --> 34:46.292
Unless he doesn't have
Serotonin Storm.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.919
He could just as easily have
too much dopamine
as serotonin,

34:49.045 --> 34:52.465
but if it's dopamine,
the cyproheptadine
will kill him.

34:52.591 --> 34:53.424
Where are you going?

34:53.550 --> 34:55.509
Gonna talk to the kid again,
he seems nice.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.052
You can't.

34:57.304 --> 34:58.929
Why? Did he say
he doesn't like me?

34:59.055 --> 35:02.183
Anesthesiologist
told the parents what you did.

35:02.309 --> 35:04.351
Everyone's a tattletale.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.485
Is your son depressed?

35:14.196 --> 35:16.530
- No. Who are you?
- I'm Dr. House.

35:16.656 --> 35:17.948
Oh, you're the idiot
who thought...

35:18.074 --> 35:19.784
I heard him screaming
all the way down the hallway.

35:19.910 --> 35:22.703
If I didn't wake him up,
I wouldn't have learned
what caused the crash.

35:22.829 --> 35:24.330
He had a seizure.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.585
This wasn't my fault?

35:30.504 --> 35:33.714
Well, if he hadn't
had the brain problem,
he wouldn't have the burns.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.925
On the other hand,
if you hadn't put him
on the ATV,

35:36.051 --> 35:37.301
he also
wouldn't have the burns.

35:37.427 --> 35:39.345
You can debate
your personal responsibility
after I leave.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.055
I need to wake him up again.

35:41.181 --> 35:42.932
I need to know if
he's taking antidepressants.

35:43.058 --> 35:44.099
He's not.

35:45.143 --> 35:48.813
- He's the happiest kid I know.
- But you don't know, do you?

35:51.024 --> 35:52.274
He's my son.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.568
That's sort of my point.

35:54.694 --> 35:58.155
At 16,
they'll tell anyone anything,
except their parents.

35:58.281 --> 35:59.865
Adam talks to us
about everything.

35:59.991 --> 36:02.034
Yeah, I know
about the pot and the cocaine.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.036
There was never... Cocaine.
What...

36:04.162 --> 36:07.248
Are you sure?
Are you having him followed?

36:07.374 --> 36:09.834
He told us
when he got drunk at a party.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.710
He told us
when he started having sex.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.420
At 16? Way to go.

36:13.547 --> 36:15.172
He told us
when he cheated
on a math test.

36:15.298 --> 36:17.550
He told us
when his girlfriend
cheated on him.

36:17.676 --> 36:20.594
- He doesn't hide anything from us.
- But if he was depressed?

36:20.720 --> 36:21.762
He'd tell us.

36:22.222 --> 36:25.015
We don't judge,
he's not depressed,
we're sure.

36:25.141 --> 36:27.268
"Bet his life on it" sure?

36:29.104 --> 36:30.855
Just hypothetically.

36:32.315 --> 36:33.440
Yeah.

36:37.112 --> 36:37.987
Okay.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.324
Kid's happy.

36:43.243 --> 36:45.286
Happy, happy, happy.

36:45.662 --> 36:49.164
Then we're back
to where we started.
Seizure disorders.

36:49.291 --> 36:52.126
Seizure disorders
aren't causing orgasms.

36:52.252 --> 36:53.752
Vascular malformations?

36:53.879 --> 36:55.921
Would've seen it
on the sonogram.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.090
Hepatic encephalopathy?

36:58.216 --> 37:00.301
Liver enzyme tests
were normal.

37:06.266 --> 37:08.851
- Where are you going?
- Take a leak.

37:16.943 --> 37:18.110
What are you doing?

37:18.236 --> 37:20.195
You can't come in here,
you're not sterile.

37:20.322 --> 37:21.530
Don't touch our son,
we told you...

37:21.656 --> 37:24.116
Seriously,
millions of bacteria,
microbes on you.

37:24.242 --> 37:27.119
He'll die of sepsis.
If you go in there...

37:31.166 --> 37:32.625
I think
he's gonna wake him up again.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.168
I know he is.

37:36.129 --> 37:37.880
House, you can't do this.

37:38.006 --> 37:42.134
Oh, if I had a nickel
for every time
I've heard that. Relax.

37:42.260 --> 37:45.763
Are they gonna sue us?
If I'm right, I save his life.

37:45.889 --> 37:48.807
If I'm wrong,
he's dead no matter what I do.

37:49.225 --> 37:52.186
Either way, how much
have I really hurt them?

37:52.312 --> 37:53.354
Leave him alone!

37:53.480 --> 37:55.940
You're not sterile.
Do you wanna kill the kid?

37:56.066 --> 37:57.983
- Give me the syringe.
- No pain, no gain.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.069
Hey, you gotta stop this.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.699
They're right.

38:06.534 --> 38:09.203
- He's not depressed.
- Yeah, sure.

38:09.329 --> 38:12.081
I'm not letting you go
till you give me that syringe.

38:12.207 --> 38:14.166
What's that on his wrist?

38:15.251 --> 38:16.293
A burn.

38:16.419 --> 38:18.796
- Why on his wrist?
- Why not on his wrist?

38:18.922 --> 38:22.758
His back, his torso,
everything's a mess.
His forearms are clean.

38:22.884 --> 38:25.094
- Except right there.
- So what?

38:26.388 --> 38:27.846
It's a perfect circle.

38:27.973 --> 38:32.059
So a drop of burning gasoline
fell on his wrist,
a screw from the ATV.

38:32.978 --> 38:34.186
Maybe.

38:44.280 --> 38:47.157
- Why are you torturing him?
- Does your son smoke?

38:48.284 --> 38:49.868
I'd kill him.

38:51.871 --> 38:56.083
So, he can talk to you
about sex, crack,
anything except cigarettes.

38:57.377 --> 39:00.129
He has a cigarette burn
on his wrist.

39:00.630 --> 39:03.966
Also a fading nicotine stain
between two fingers.

39:04.718 --> 39:07.970
Bad news,
your son has a filthy,
unhealthy habit.

39:08.096 --> 39:10.264
Good news,
he's trying to quit.

39:10.390 --> 39:12.516
Bad news,
the quitting's killing him.

39:12.642 --> 39:15.352
Good news,
I can cure him. Bad news...

39:16.938 --> 39:21.316
- Nope, that's the end of it.
- Quitting smoking can kill?

39:21.443 --> 39:23.444
No-smoke meds
are antidepressants.

39:23.570 --> 39:25.612
The crappy ones
you get over the Internet

39:25.739 --> 39:28.449
are loaded
with whatever antidepressants
they can get cheap.

39:28.575 --> 39:32.911
And since Mommy and Daddy
obviously didn't take him
to a pediatrician...

39:35.123 --> 39:38.333
Sorry, I was wrong
about him being depressed.

39:38.835 --> 39:40.252
Treat him.

39:58.313 --> 39:59.354
Hey!

40:00.482 --> 40:02.691
Did you drop acid?

40:04.319 --> 40:07.154
- Why would I do that?
- To annoy me.

40:07.322 --> 40:09.782
Or maybe because
you're miserable,

40:09.908 --> 40:13.243
or because
you want to self-destruct.

40:13.411 --> 40:14.787
Pick one.

40:15.371 --> 40:19.333
How about because LSD
acts on serotonin receptors
in the brain,

40:19.459 --> 40:22.169
which can stop
a migraine in its tracks.

40:22.587 --> 40:25.172
I'm just saying
that's also a possibility.

40:25.298 --> 40:28.550
- How did you know about it?
- Cameron is worried about you.

40:28.676 --> 40:32.513
I told her that LSD lasts
up to 12 hours, if you were
functional, she must be wrong.

40:32.639 --> 40:35.390
Either that or I also took
a whole bunch
of antidepressants,

40:35.517 --> 40:37.601
which short-circuited the LSD.

40:37.727 --> 40:39.478
I'm just saying
that would also explain it.

40:39.604 --> 40:41.939
Thank you for ruining
my clinical trials.

40:42.065 --> 40:44.024
Pharmaceutical company's
shutting me down.

40:44.150 --> 40:46.401
- You're kidding. Really?
- How could that surprise you?

40:46.528 --> 40:47.486
You sent them an email

40:47.612 --> 40:50.280
complaining about my math,
telling them about your stunt.

40:50.406 --> 40:52.366
I didn't know
people actually read emails.

40:52.492 --> 40:54.034
Delete button's
so conveniently located.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.912
So what's next?
You gonna follow me my whole life?

40:57.038 --> 40:58.747
- Torture me?
- Why would I do that?

40:58.873 --> 41:02.960
You waited 20 years
to do this. What's next?
Break up my marriage?

41:03.837 --> 41:07.172
- No. We're even.
- Right.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.301
Oh, thanks for setting me up.

41:15.181 --> 41:18.392
Eye for an eye,
LSD and antidepressants.

41:19.394 --> 41:21.186
Everything in balance.

41:21.312 --> 41:24.356
Buddhists call it Karma.
Christians call it
the Golden Rule.

41:24.482 --> 41:25.941
Jews call it...

41:27.986 --> 41:31.321
I don't know,
Rabbi Hillel
said something poignant.

41:32.532 --> 41:35.075
Universe
always settles the score.

41:35.743 --> 41:38.328
- Does it?
- No.

41:40.206 --> 41:41.623
But it should.

41:49.257 --> 41:53.260
Do you think you'll ever
be able to look at him
and not blame me?

41:54.137 --> 41:57.181
Yeah. Will you?
