Why'd you take the girl?

Protect her. Girl's in danger.

When we jumped,
you told me I died of cancer.

-What?

Fair enough and noted.

Here's where we come down
on all this.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.076
Ten years ago,
you murdered one Miles Dyson...

01:17.243 --> 01:18.911
...employee of Cyberdyne.

01:19.079 --> 01:22.539
Long time gone, but the man's still dead,
so we've got that.

01:22.707 --> 01:26.001
Eight years ago, you and your son
and a high school friend of his...

01:26.169 --> 01:29.004
...blow up a bank vault
and die in the explosion.

01:29.172 --> 01:32.508
Now, of course, you're still alive,
which is inconvenient for many...

01:32.675 --> 01:35.594
...but the bank's still blown,
so we've got that.

01:35.762 --> 01:38.847
More recently,
and by that I mean Monday...

01:39.015 --> 01:42.184
...you participated in a firefight,

01:44.604 --> 01:47.481

both federal and international.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.821
Two of the dead were
law-enforcement officers...

01:53.988 --> 01:58.283

but in that I do digress.

There's two ways I can bring your son
into custody: with your help or dead.

02:19.931 --> 02:22.391
-Which do you think it should be?
-My son?

02:22.559 --> 02:24.393
Your son. John Connor.

02:26.354 --> 02:29.898
-John is dead.
-I don't think so.

The desk clerk could have clocked us.

03:14.736 --> 03:19.156

of the incident has high risk factors.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.565
We should be prepared.

05:58.733 --> 05:59.858
John Henry was hacked.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.194
And we fixed that.

06:02.362 --> 06:06.198
Besides, I think we're past the point
where moving the hardware's a good idea.

06:06.366 --> 06:10.952
In fact, I think it's potentially
a really bad idea.

And where is she?

Not where.

When.

38:27.179 --> 38:29.264
What? What do you mean, when?

38:31.100 --> 38:33.393
I know that. I've seen it before.

No.

I was building something to fight it.
