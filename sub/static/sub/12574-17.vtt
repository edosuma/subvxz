00:25.335 --> 00:28.270
Your friendship and service
over these many years

00:28.271 --> 00:30.239
have been a blessing to me,
Matthew.

00:30.240 --> 00:32.674
I shall miss you.

00:32.676 --> 00:34.577
My Lord, I fear the Keeper.

00:34.578 --> 00:38.013
Your faith in the Creator
will protect you.

00:43.253 --> 00:46.422
Farewell, old friend.

00:50.594 --> 00:55.030
My Lord, it won't be
safe here for long.

00:55.031 --> 00:56.699
Matthew was loyal,
but not strong.

00:56.700 --> 01:00.235
He will not withstand
the torments of the Underworld.

01:00.236 --> 01:03.572
He will reveal our hiding place
to Darken Rahl.

01:03.573 --> 01:06.709
We always knew that one day
we might be discovered.

01:09.112 --> 01:12.514
And if that day is today...

01:12.515 --> 01:14.850
let it be today.

01:16.119 --> 01:19.355
Welcome to the Underworld,
Matthew.

01:19.356 --> 01:22.024
It's so wonderful to see you
again after all these years.

01:22.025 --> 01:23.792
You always were

01:23.793 --> 01:27.029
one of my father's
favorite servants.

01:27.030 --> 01:30.633
So tell me,
where is the old man now?

01:30.634 --> 01:33.102
You killed your father
years ago.

01:33.103 --> 01:35.170
He must be here,
in the Underworld.

01:35.171 --> 01:38.574
Yes, I did kill my father
years ago.

01:38.575 --> 01:40.242
So imagine my surprise

01:40.243 --> 01:42.444
when I myself arrived
in the Underworld

01:42.445 --> 01:45.047
and discovered
that he was not here.

01:47.984 --> 01:52.588
But then I remembered
that many of his retinue

01:52.589 --> 01:55.858
fled the palace
shortly after I killed him.

01:55.859 --> 02:00.095
I can only conclude that you
somehow revived my father

02:00.096 --> 02:01.697
and then spirited him away.

02:01.698 --> 02:04.133
I...

02:04.134 --> 02:06.068
I don't know
what you're talking about.

02:12.442 --> 02:16.478
Father once left me
in your charge. Do you remember?

02:16.479 --> 02:19.114
It was the day
we found my pet kitten

02:19.115 --> 02:21.383
dead in the gardens.

02:21.384 --> 02:25.988
When you saw those maggots
squirming out of its eyes

02:25.989 --> 02:28.357
you almost fainted.

02:34.397 --> 02:36.632
Now, where is my father?

02:50.413 --> 02:51.780
Hello, Thaddicus.

02:51.781 --> 02:53.649
What do you want?

02:53.650 --> 02:57.419
What I want is what I believe
you want as well.

02:57.420 --> 03:00.155
To bring death to the man
who murdered your father.

03:00.156 --> 03:02.858
The man who murdered my father
was your father,

03:02.859 --> 03:04.126
and you killed him years ago.

03:04.127 --> 03:06.829
Somehow my father
cheated death,

03:06.830 --> 03:10.966
just as he cheated everything
and everyone in life.

03:10.967 --> 03:14.103
Now I have finally discovered
where he has hidden himself

03:14.104 --> 03:16.138
all these years.

03:16.139 --> 03:18.240
Unfortunately, as I am a spirit,

03:18.241 --> 03:20.743
I myself cannot kill him again,

03:20.744 --> 03:24.613
but I thought you might want to.

03:27.217 --> 03:28.450
Even if I did want

03:28.451 --> 03:30.119
to ram a dagger into
that bastard's heart,

03:30.120 --> 03:31.520
why are you coming to me?

03:31.521 --> 03:34.523
I'm not powerful enough to-to
kill someone like Panis Rahl.

03:34.524 --> 03:38.560
No, but your brother is.

03:38.561 --> 03:41.230
Well, why don't you go to him?

03:41.231 --> 03:43.365
Because the great Zeddicus
will not listen to anything

03:43.366 --> 03:44.900
that comes from me,

03:44.901 --> 03:49.371
but maybe if he were
to hear it from family...

03:52.475 --> 03:54.476
This is the longest the compass

03:54.477 --> 03:56.278
has ever pointed
in one direction.

03:56.279 --> 03:58.447
Who would ever have dreamed
that the Seeker

03:58.448 --> 04:00.549
could go 12 days
without stopping

04:00.550 --> 04:03.919
to save helpless children
or distressed farm animals.

04:03.920 --> 04:06.522
Perhaps it's a sign that we're
nearing the Stone of Tears.

04:06.523 --> 04:07.723
And then what?

04:07.724 --> 04:09.458
We use the Stone to close
the tear in the veil.

04:09.459 --> 04:10.692
But how?

04:14.664 --> 04:17.031
Hm.
My point exactly.

04:17.033 --> 04:19.201
For three months

04:19.202 --> 04:22.237
we've been going after
this mysterious Stone,

04:22.238 --> 04:23.806
but none of us
has the slightest clue

04:23.807 --> 04:27.643
what we're actually supposed
to do with it once we find it.

04:29.913 --> 04:32.614
Richard has succeeded
at every task laid before him.

04:32.615 --> 04:34.883
When the time comes,
I believe fate

04:34.884 --> 04:36.752
will provide him
with the answer.

04:43.593 --> 04:45.861
Thaddicus.

04:47.497 --> 04:48.730
Good to see you too, brother.

04:48.731 --> 04:50.299
How did you find us?

04:50.300 --> 04:54.303
Our old friend Sebastian
made me one of his maps.

04:54.304 --> 04:57.172
Charged me for it too,
the scoundrel.

04:59.075 --> 05:01.210
I need to speak with you.

05:01.211 --> 05:03.011
Alone.

05:03.012 --> 05:05.280
For 24 years no one's seen
hide nor hair of Panis Rahl

05:05.281 --> 05:06.982
and now you know
precisely where he is?

05:06.983 --> 05:10.285
Oh, of course, how could
an old fool like Thaddicus

05:10.286 --> 05:11.587
know anything so important?

05:11.588 --> 05:14.456
Uh, let me tell you, Zedd,
I'm a man of the world.

05:14.457 --> 05:17.025
I travel, I trade,
I meet people, I hear things.

05:17.026 --> 05:19.127
You've never been able
to deceive me, Thaddicus,

05:19.128 --> 05:20.729
so don't try now.

05:20.730 --> 05:23.165
How did you learn
about Panis?

05:23.166 --> 05:25.601
Darken Rahl appeared to me.

05:28.071 --> 05:30.472
And you take that demon
at his word?

05:30.473 --> 05:32.507
For all we know, he might
be trying to lure me away

05:32.508 --> 05:34.142
from Richard
for some nefarious purpose.

05:34.143 --> 05:35.177
I don't think so.

05:35.178 --> 05:36.979
He wants Panis dead
as much as we do

05:36.980 --> 05:40.382
and this might be our only
chance to avenge Father's death.

05:43.186 --> 05:45.654
Even if you're right,

05:45.655 --> 05:47.789
Richard may be close to finding
the Stone of Tears.

05:47.790 --> 05:48.857
I can't leave his side.

05:48.858 --> 05:52.261
Zedd, we swore an oath.

05:53.696 --> 05:54.997
<i>Father?</i>

05:54.998 --> 05:56.865
Thaddicus?

06:11.814 --> 06:14.583
Where have you been
all these months?

06:14.584 --> 06:16.385
You were supposed to be here.

06:16.386 --> 06:19.321
You could have protected him.

06:19.322 --> 06:22.057
What happened?

06:22.058 --> 06:24.259
He was murdered.

06:24.260 --> 06:25.928
By Panis Rahl.

06:25.929 --> 06:29.164
No.

06:29.165 --> 06:30.599
No, that's impossible.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.200
Are you calling me a liar?

06:32.201 --> 06:33.568
I saw it with my own eyes.

06:33.569 --> 06:36.405
Saw what exactly?

06:36.406 --> 06:39.141
I came home to see you
and Father arguing.

06:39.142 --> 06:40.943
You said it yourself.
I haven't been home.

06:40.944 --> 06:43.946
If for once you'd listen to me
you'd understand!

06:43.947 --> 06:48.283
<i>You and Father were arguing.</i>

06:48.284 --> 06:50.686
<i>I couldn't hear what</i>
<i>you were arguing about, I--</i>

06:50.687 --> 06:54.923
<i>I didn't want to intrude.</i>

06:54.924 --> 06:59.361
<i>And then suddenly</i>
<i>you drew a knife</i>

06:59.362 --> 07:02.164
<i>and began stabbing Father.</i>

07:02.165 --> 07:03.632
What are you talking about?

07:03.633 --> 07:04.900
I would never stab Father!

07:04.901 --> 07:06.635
Then shut your mouth
and listen!

07:09.105 --> 07:12.507
I should have tried to stop it.

07:12.508 --> 07:14.710
I should have tried
to help Father.

07:14.711 --> 07:18.213
<i>I couldn't.</i>

07:18.214 --> 07:21.950
<i>But then I saw it--</i>
<i>It wasn't you.</i>

07:23.486 --> 07:24.753
<i>It was Panis Rahl.</i>

07:24.754 --> 07:28.423
<i>Only he'd disguised</i>
<i>himself as you.</i>

07:28.424 --> 07:30.826
Father died...

07:32.161 --> 07:34.463
thinking I killed him?

07:34.464 --> 07:35.764
Zedd...

07:35.765 --> 07:40.669
swear that no matter
what happens,

07:40.670 --> 07:43.905
no mattew how far apart
life takes us,

07:43.906 --> 07:47.609
we will never rest
until we drive this dagger

07:47.610 --> 07:49.277
into Panis Rahl's heart.

07:54.784 --> 07:56.918
We promised each other, Zedd.

07:56.919 --> 07:59.654
Yes.

07:59.655 --> 08:01.289
Yes, and we owe it to Father.

08:01.290 --> 08:04.226
But Panis is too dangerous.

08:04.227 --> 08:06.461
I'll go alone.

08:06.462 --> 08:08.764
Please, Zedd.

08:08.765 --> 08:11.099
While Father was being killed,

08:11.100 --> 08:13.201
I just stood there
like a trembling lamb

08:13.202 --> 08:14.636
and did nothing.

08:14.637 --> 08:18.173
Don't make me do nothing now.

08:18.174 --> 08:20.175
You're leaving? Why?

08:20.176 --> 08:22.010
It's a family matter.

08:22.011 --> 08:23.111
Zedd, I'm family.

08:23.112 --> 08:25.313
If something's wrong,
I want to help.

08:25.314 --> 08:28.583
Nothing's wrong that Thaddicus
and I can't manage on our own.

08:28.584 --> 08:32.154
I'll catch up with you as soon
as we settle our business.

08:32.155 --> 08:34.856
Business. What business?

08:34.857 --> 08:37.826
It's nothing
to concern yourself with.

08:50.747 --> 08:52.682
Sorry you had to leave Richard.

08:52.683 --> 08:54.951
It isn't that.
Richard is well-protected

08:54.952 --> 08:57.019
by Kahlan and Cara.
I was just thinking

08:57.020 --> 08:58.588
that none of this
would be necessary

08:58.589 --> 09:00.122
if only I'd listened
to Father.

09:05.429 --> 09:08.564
Darken Rahl,
future lord of D'Hara!

09:08.565 --> 09:11.734
He has your eyes,
my lord.

09:11.735 --> 09:14.003
Zedd.

09:17.341 --> 09:20.176
You have been
such a loyal friend.

09:20.177 --> 09:22.178
And you've already done
more for me

09:22.179 --> 09:25.114
than any man has a right to ask,

09:25.115 --> 09:28.784
but would you do me the great
service of teaching my son,

09:28.785 --> 09:30.620
just as your father taught me?

09:32.890 --> 09:34.490
I would be honored.

09:37.060 --> 09:41.264
Now relax, my friend,
and enjoy yourself.

10:05.489 --> 10:08.024
What are you doing here, Father?

10:08.025 --> 10:13.262
The great Wizard,
Zeddicus Z'ul Zorander,

10:13.263 --> 10:16.265
bought for the price
of a harlot.

10:16.266 --> 10:19.468
I haven't been bought
by anybody.

10:19.469 --> 10:20.870
Panis is my friend.

10:20.871 --> 10:25.241
Oh, yes, Panis Rahl was a great
friend of mine as well,

10:25.242 --> 10:28.978
until I refused
to teach him magic.

10:28.979 --> 10:31.981
Then he set about finding
a new friend.

10:31.982 --> 10:33.983
In your day, Father,

10:33.984 --> 10:36.953
D'Hara was a land
of gentle farm folk.

10:36.954 --> 10:39.956
Now it is darkened
by the smoke of war.

10:39.957 --> 10:43.059
Magic is necessary
to protect all of us

10:43.060 --> 10:45.494
and most especially our king.

10:45.495 --> 10:49.231
So it's true.
You have taught Panis magic.

10:50.534 --> 10:52.935
I'm only teaching him
to use the magic

10:52.936 --> 10:55.338
that already runs
in his bloodline.

10:55.339 --> 10:58.708
There is a reason why the magic
in the Rahl bloodline

10:58.709 --> 11:01.143
has been dormant
since they assumed the throne.

11:01.144 --> 11:03.279
Our ancestors
made sure of it.

11:03.280 --> 11:05.881
Because no king
should ever possess

11:05.882 --> 11:07.483
both earthly and magical powers.

11:07.484 --> 11:10.720
Together they create
an unstoppable force

11:10.721 --> 11:13.489
that can only produce tyranny.

11:13.490 --> 11:16.592
Panis will not be able
to resist the temptation

11:16.593 --> 11:20.062
to dominate everything
and everyone in this world.

11:20.063 --> 11:21.330
But he trusts me.

11:21.331 --> 11:23.466
I will be able
to teach him

11:23.467 --> 11:26.869
to use his magic
wisely and justly.

11:26.870 --> 11:29.772
Zeddicus, you know nothing
of this family,

11:29.773 --> 11:33.175
or what it will become if you
continue to do their bidding.

11:33.176 --> 11:37.713
So now you have the power
to see into the future?

11:40.117 --> 11:42.785
Come home with me now,
Zeddicus.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.220
Before it's too late.

11:47.257 --> 11:50.526
My place is here, Father.

11:50.527 --> 11:52.395
I'm not going anywhere.

11:57.734 --> 11:59.802
Carracticus.

12:01.571 --> 12:02.705
My old teacher.

12:02.706 --> 12:06.142
I've missed you.

12:06.143 --> 12:08.811
Oh, I know we've had
our differences in the past,

12:08.812 --> 12:11.147
but on the occasion
of the birth of my son,

12:11.148 --> 12:15.484
can't we put that aside and
share a drink like old friends?

12:16.953 --> 12:20.189
You may have seduced my son

12:20.190 --> 12:22.124
into believing your lies...

12:24.094 --> 12:26.462
but I know
exactly what you are.

12:26.463 --> 12:29.965
And I will do whatever it takes

12:29.966 --> 12:34.703
to end the tyranny
of the House of Rahl.

12:34.704 --> 12:38.240
<i>Father was right about</i>
<i>the future of the Rahl dynasty.</i>

12:38.241 --> 12:39.542
If I'd listened to him,

12:39.543 --> 12:41.544
I would have been home
the night he was murdered.

12:41.545 --> 12:43.646
I would have been
able to stop Panis.

12:43.647 --> 12:47.183
You had important business
the night he died.

12:47.184 --> 12:49.051
That's what I told you then...

12:49.052 --> 12:52.354
<i>but it wasn't true.</i>

12:52.355 --> 12:54.290
Bad news?

12:55.592 --> 12:57.159
From my father.

12:57.160 --> 12:58.894
What does he say?

13:01.431 --> 13:04.066
He apologizes
for barging into the palace

13:04.067 --> 13:07.570
and disrupting
your celebration.

13:09.139 --> 13:12.241
Then he begs me to come home.

13:12.242 --> 13:15.878
Says he wants to me peace.

13:15.879 --> 13:19.315
The times have passed
your father by, Zeddicus.

13:19.316 --> 13:20.783
He was once a great man,

13:20.784 --> 13:23.686
but now he's just
holding you back.

13:23.687 --> 13:26.622
Yes.

13:28.992 --> 13:32.294
But he is still my father.

13:32.295 --> 13:34.763
And he does love me.

13:36.399 --> 13:39.268
If he wants to make peace,

13:39.269 --> 13:42.071
maybe I should hear
what he has to say.

13:42.072 --> 13:45.207
You're right.

13:45.208 --> 13:47.143
A man should make peace
with his father.

13:47.144 --> 13:48.944
Go to him.

13:48.945 --> 13:50.045
Be with him.

13:50.046 --> 13:52.148
And while you're there,

13:52.149 --> 13:54.483
tell him I would also
like to make peace with him.

13:56.286 --> 13:58.087
I'll return as soon as I can.

13:58.088 --> 13:59.788
Have a safe journey.

14:02.325 --> 14:05.728
I'll tell Princess Ariana
you can see her next time.

14:05.729 --> 14:08.497
Princess Ariana is here?

14:08.498 --> 14:12.234
Yes. That's what I was
coming to tell you.

14:12.235 --> 14:16.438
Apparently, she grew quite
fond of you on her last visit.

14:17.741 --> 14:19.475
As I did of her.

14:19.476 --> 14:21.510
Doubly unfortunate, then,

14:21.511 --> 14:23.179
that she's only here
for one night.

14:24.781 --> 14:27.149
Perhaps she's worth
a short delay.

14:28.652 --> 14:30.286
<i>My important business</i>

14:30.287 --> 14:32.888
was bedding a a young beauty.

14:32.889 --> 14:35.457
I was so blinded
by lust for power,

14:35.458 --> 14:36.792
as well as for Princess Ariana,

14:36.793 --> 14:40.696
that I-- I didn't see
how Panis was deceiving me.

14:40.697 --> 14:42.131
Well, brother,

14:42.132 --> 14:44.934
you're finally going to get
a chance to pay him back.

14:49.139 --> 14:51.140
<i>Maybe we should</i>
<i>be looking for Zedd.</i>

14:51.141 --> 14:54.577
If Zedd doesn't want
to be found, we won't find him.

14:54.578 --> 14:56.378
I just wish
he'd ask for our help.

14:56.379 --> 14:59.381
Richard, whatever business
Zedd's attending to,

14:59.382 --> 15:02.218
it's clearly private.
We have to respect that.

15:04.054 --> 15:06.722
He'll catch up with us
when he's ready.

15:17.634 --> 15:20.903
Help me! It's my life's work!

15:32.716 --> 15:35.351
The Sword of Truth.

15:35.352 --> 15:37.019
You're the Seeker.

15:37.020 --> 15:39.321
Just the person
I've been looking for.

15:39.322 --> 15:43.425
The Creator herself
must have brought us together.

15:43.426 --> 15:44.660
Why is that?

15:44.661 --> 15:47.363
So that I can--
I can join you on your quest.

15:48.798 --> 15:51.166
I'm letting my enthusiasm
get the better of me.

15:51.167 --> 15:52.468
Forgive me.

15:52.469 --> 15:55.604
Horace Guildermayer,

15:55.605 --> 15:57.773
scholar and antiquarian,

15:57.774 --> 16:00.876
ready to fight and die
at your service.

16:01.911 --> 16:04.079
As difficult as it will be

16:04.080 --> 16:06.348
to succeed without you,

16:06.349 --> 16:07.750
we'll have to find a way.

16:09.352 --> 16:10.986
But thank you for your interest.

16:10.987 --> 16:13.722
No, no, no. No, you-- You--
You don't understand.

16:13.723 --> 16:15.924
After a lifetime of scholarship,

16:15.925 --> 16:19.528
I have finally made a discovery
of vital importance.

16:19.529 --> 16:23.932
Hidden inside
the Winding Wall of Valdaire

16:23.933 --> 16:25.868
is an ancient scroll.

16:25.869 --> 16:30.773
It instructs the bearer
of the Stone of Tears

16:30.774 --> 16:32.708
how to use it

16:32.709 --> 16:34.677
to seal the rift
to the Underworld.

16:34.678 --> 16:38.280
Seeker, without my help,

16:38.281 --> 16:39.581
you will never find the scroll,

16:39.582 --> 16:42.351
your quest will fail,

16:42.352 --> 16:47.189
and the world of the living
will come to an end.

16:54.225 --> 16:56.793
Am I the only one who
finds it a little suspicious

16:56.794 --> 16:58.995
that we were just
asking ourselves

16:58.996 --> 17:00.930
what we should do
when we find the Stone,

17:00.931 --> 17:03.333
and suddenly
a mysterious man shows up

17:03.334 --> 17:05.835
saying he knows where
the instructions are?

17:05.836 --> 17:08.070
Zedd did say,
when it was time,

17:08.071 --> 17:09.606
fate would provide
Richard the answer.

17:09.607 --> 17:11.875
Maybe this is how.

17:15.445 --> 17:17.480
We appreciate your help,

17:17.481 --> 17:19.549
but if you told us
where this wall is,

17:19.550 --> 17:20.950
we could find the scroll
ourselves.

17:20.951 --> 17:24.119
Well, I wish that were possible,
but it's not.

17:24.121 --> 17:27.123
Long ago, the Order of Ulrich

17:27.124 --> 17:29.859
was assigned to protect
the scroll.

17:29.860 --> 17:32.495
One of the monks sealed it

17:32.496 --> 17:35.799
inside the Winding Wall
for safekeeping.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.367
He spelled the niche

17:37.368 --> 17:42.038
so that it could only be opened
using a secret code.

17:42.039 --> 17:45.308
But the key to the code
was lost,

17:45.309 --> 17:46.976
seemingly forever.

17:46.977 --> 17:49.012
Until now.

17:49.013 --> 17:52.482
Using fragments
of the monk's papers,

17:52.483 --> 17:56.152
I have painstakingly
created this lexicon.

17:56.153 --> 18:00.623
And with this,
I have deciphered the code.

18:00.624 --> 18:02.325
Well, then you can
teach it to me.

18:02.326 --> 18:04.127
We haven't the time.

18:04.128 --> 18:06.329
The Keeper's forces

18:06.330 --> 18:09.332
grow stronger every day.

18:09.333 --> 18:12.902
Seeker, I-I am aware of the fact
that I am now an old man,

18:12.903 --> 18:15.371
and I do not wish
to burden you,

18:15.372 --> 18:20.009
but you need this
and you need me.

18:21.879 --> 18:24.080
Let's go.

18:24.081 --> 18:26.349
Calm down.

18:26.350 --> 18:27.984
What do you mean,
"calm down"?

18:27.985 --> 18:29.319
Panis is in there.

18:29.320 --> 18:30.653
Yes, and he's guarded.

18:30.654 --> 18:32.655
They're just monks.

18:38.596 --> 18:41.397
Armed monks who protected
the evil tyrant

18:41.398 --> 18:44.734
all these years.

18:44.735 --> 18:47.337
Stay close behind me.

19:07.625 --> 19:10.526
Now, let's find Panis.

19:19.236 --> 19:23.273
Did you think you could
hide forever, Panis?

19:24.475 --> 19:26.042
That's for our Father.

19:35.586 --> 19:37.453
It's not him.

19:37.454 --> 19:39.355
What are you talking about?

19:45.262 --> 19:49.699
He used the magic I taught him
to trick me again.

19:55.806 --> 19:58.341
How are we going to find
Panis now?

19:58.342 --> 20:00.410
We'll search
the monastery.

20:00.411 --> 20:03.846
There must be some clue
as to where he was going.

20:03.847 --> 20:06.883
Let me save you
the trouble, Wizard.

20:09.453 --> 20:11.554
After everything
you've done,

20:11.555 --> 20:13.589
all the death and destruction
you've caused,

20:13.590 --> 20:15.158
you think I'd listen
to a word you'd say?

20:15.159 --> 20:17.961
For once our interests
are aligned,

20:17.962 --> 20:19.662
yet all you can do
is dwell on the past?

20:19.663 --> 20:21.798
Really, Zeddicus,
that's rather petty of you.

20:21.799 --> 20:24.701
If our interests were aligned,
you wouldn't have led us here

20:24.702 --> 20:26.336
to murder the wrong man.

20:26.337 --> 20:30.273
Oh, I had no idea my father
was gone from this place.

20:30.274 --> 20:32.408
As I am unable to walk
among the living,

20:32.409 --> 20:34.944
I can only know what I am told
by the recently dead.

20:34.945 --> 20:39.248
Fortunately, your vengeful
rampage has provided me

20:39.249 --> 20:41.217
with a fresh supply of souls.

20:41.218 --> 20:43.019
I've already tortured one
into telling me

20:43.020 --> 20:45.521
where my father went.

20:45.522 --> 20:49.225
We'll take no more
direction from you!

20:49.226 --> 20:51.060
Then you won't want
to know that Panis

20:51.061 --> 20:54.197
has disguised himself
as a kindly, old scholar,

20:54.198 --> 20:56.933
and that he has gone
to find his other son,

20:56.934 --> 20:59.936
my brother, your grandson.

21:04.274 --> 21:05.408
Did you ever doubt

21:05.409 --> 21:07.477
that you would learn
the secret code to Valdaire?

21:07.478 --> 21:10.113
No. No. My only doubt

21:10.114 --> 21:12.582
was that I'd live
long enough to find you,

21:12.583 --> 21:15.051
but when I last checked,
my heart was still beating.

21:19.823 --> 21:22.091
How about you, Richard?

21:22.092 --> 21:23.926
Do you ever have any doubts

21:23.927 --> 21:25.628
about the success
of your own quest?

21:25.629 --> 21:27.997
Sometimes.

21:27.998 --> 21:32.602
You have already saved the world
from Darken Rahl.

21:32.603 --> 21:36.839
And by doing that, I opened up
a rift to the Underworld.

21:36.840 --> 21:38.541
And now things
are worse than before.

21:38.542 --> 21:41.210
Richard.

21:41.211 --> 21:43.513
You succeeded once.

21:43.514 --> 21:46.582
You will succeed again.

21:49.486 --> 21:51.587
I hope you're right.

21:54.792 --> 21:57.326
Think of it this way.

21:57.327 --> 22:01.998
How many men
get to save the world

22:01.999 --> 22:04.567
with the woman they love
by their side twice?

22:08.705 --> 22:10.740
Sounds like something
my father would say.

22:12.643 --> 22:14.911
He must have been a wise man.

22:17.347 --> 22:19.315
What about you, Horace?

22:19.316 --> 22:20.750
Do you have a family?

22:23.887 --> 22:25.488
Two sons.

22:25.489 --> 22:27.790
Are they scholars too?

22:30.060 --> 22:31.928
No, no.

22:31.929 --> 22:35.164
No, they took
very different paths.

22:35.165 --> 22:36.732
Do you get to see them often?

22:40.871 --> 22:43.139
One of them is dead.

22:44.875 --> 22:46.175
I'm sorry for your loss.

22:46.176 --> 22:47.210
Oh, don't be.

22:47.211 --> 22:49.812
He led a tragic life.

22:49.813 --> 22:52.415
What about your other son?

23:01.925 --> 23:04.827
He and I...

23:04.828 --> 23:06.262
we're not close.

23:08.699 --> 23:11.100
But I couldn't be
more proud of him.

23:16.039 --> 23:18.174
Horace, wake up.

23:18.175 --> 23:20.676
Oh. Oh, I've overslept.
I am so sorry.

23:20.677 --> 23:22.411
I'm ready to go.

23:22.412 --> 23:23.679
It's all right, Horace.

23:23.680 --> 23:25.014
Have something to eat.

23:30.354 --> 23:31.988
It's Zedd.

23:36.693 --> 23:38.361
Zedd, what are you doing?!

23:39.997 --> 23:42.999
Out of my way, Richard.
Cara, protect Horace.

23:47.271 --> 23:49.739
That's the man
who killed my father.

23:51.942 --> 23:56.679
Zedd, there must be a mistake.
This man is a scholar.

23:56.680 --> 23:58.614
He's taking us to a place
where we can find out

23:58.615 --> 24:00.750
what we're supposed to do
with the Stone of Tears.

24:00.751 --> 24:03.719
He can disguise himself
however he wants.

24:03.720 --> 24:06.689
There's no mistake.
He's Panis Rahl!

24:08.392 --> 24:09.792
That can't be.

24:09.793 --> 24:13.930
Zedd is telling the truth,
Richard.

24:13.931 --> 24:17.233
I am a scholar,

24:17.234 --> 24:19.835
but I am also Panis Rahl,

24:19.836 --> 24:21.070
your father.

24:27.478 --> 24:28.545
Give me one reason

24:28.546 --> 24:29.879
why I shouldn't
let Zedd kill you right now.

24:29.880 --> 24:32.749
I know how this must appear,

24:32.750 --> 24:34.684
but everything I have told you,

24:34.685 --> 24:36.786
except for my name, is true.

24:39.606 --> 24:41.707
Twenty-four years ago,

24:41.708 --> 24:44.677
I renounced my former life.

24:44.678 --> 24:49.148
I took the oaths
of the Order of Ulrich.

24:49.149 --> 24:51.150
Since then,

24:51.151 --> 24:56.555
I have led an austere life
of prayer and study.

24:56.556 --> 25:00.359
I sought not only to uncover
the secrets of Valdaire,

25:00.360 --> 25:02.795
but also to atone

25:02.796 --> 25:05.564
for my many and terrible sins.

25:05.565 --> 25:07.467
Don't listen to his lies,
Richard.

25:08.736 --> 25:10.471
I am not lying.

25:10.772 --> 25:12.573
If I had come to you
in the guise of a man

25:12.874 --> 25:14.908
that the world only knows
the worst side of,

25:14.909 --> 25:16.576
you'd never have
trusted me.

25:16.577 --> 25:17.378
Forty years ago,

25:17.479 --> 25:19.347
he charmed me into
teaching him the magic

25:19.348 --> 25:20.648
he used to kill my father

25:21.049 --> 25:22.850
and now he's
to trick you, Richard.

25:24.787 --> 25:28.224
I did use the magic Zedd taught
me to kill his father.

25:30.125 --> 25:34.328
And that was just a
terrible mistake.

25:36.566 --> 25:40.201
I have been doing pepenance
for it ever since.

25:41.304 --> 25:42.404
But at the time

25:43.705 --> 25:45.574
I thought I had no choice.

25:46.909 --> 25:48.711
Before you allow him to kill me,

25:49.212 --> 25:51.682
and thus end all chances
of finding the scroll,

25:52.983 --> 25:56.985
allow me tell you
what happened and why.

25:57.486 --> 26:00.022
If you have something to say,
say it.

26:01.458 --> 26:03.125
All those years ago,

26:03.126 --> 26:06.162
there was was an awful set
that I kept from you, Zedd.

26:12.435 --> 26:14.903
Your son's illness
is not natural, My Lord.

26:15.904 --> 26:17.104
The fever has been caused

26:17.105 --> 26:18.105
by a terrible curse

26:18.304 --> 26:19.405
cast from afar.

26:19.406 --> 26:21.640
A curse?

26:21.641 --> 26:25.945
Yes. And one that could only
have been sent by a Wizard.

26:25.946 --> 26:28.347
Carracticus.

26:29.983 --> 26:31.984
Send for Zeddicus.

26:31.985 --> 26:34.787
He may be able to save your son.

26:36.056 --> 26:37.456
No.

26:40.594 --> 26:41.894
Let him die.

26:43.396 --> 26:45.564
<i>I let the disease</i>
<i>run its course</i>

26:45.565 --> 26:49.301
and the child soon expired.

26:52.773 --> 26:54.740
But I had a Mord-Sith
revive him,

26:54.741 --> 26:58.811
and my son was soon alive
and healthy again.

26:58.812 --> 27:01.213
My father may have been
a difficult man,

27:01.214 --> 27:02.448
but he was no baby-killer!

27:02.449 --> 27:04.984
That's what I thought.

27:04.985 --> 27:08.053
But who else could have done it?

27:08.054 --> 27:11.123
I decided I would
ask him myself,

27:11.124 --> 27:14.426
but knowing that he would
never tell me the truth,

27:14.427 --> 27:18.063
I decided to disguise
myself as you.

27:21.101 --> 27:23.936
Zeddicus.

27:23.937 --> 27:25.471
Oh. I'm so glad
you've come.

27:25.472 --> 27:30.342
Did you cast a curse upon
Panis Rahl's infant son?

27:30.343 --> 27:33.279
Is he dead?

27:33.280 --> 27:36.448
No. By luck, he survived.

27:36.449 --> 27:38.751
How could you do
such a monstrous thing?

27:38.752 --> 27:41.053
I'm sorry that I had to do it,

27:41.054 --> 27:43.122
but I'm even sorrier
that I failed.

27:43.123 --> 27:45.257
Have you lost your mind?

27:51.498 --> 27:55.301
The great witch Shota
came to me with a prophecy

27:55.302 --> 27:59.004
that Darken Rahl would grow up
to kill his own father

27:59.005 --> 28:03.275
and become the most brutal
tyrant the world has ever known.

28:04.711 --> 28:07.413
Now the baby's life
has been threatened.

28:07.414 --> 28:09.882
Panis will spare no effort
to protect him.

28:11.885 --> 28:14.920
Everything depends
on you now, Zeddicus.

28:14.921 --> 28:18.157
You're the only one
who can get close enough.

28:18.158 --> 28:20.860
You must go back
to the palace

28:20.861 --> 28:23.495
and, horrible as it sounds,

28:23.496 --> 28:25.564
you must kill Darken Rahl.

28:25.565 --> 28:29.535
I'm not going to kill him.

28:29.536 --> 28:30.669
I'm going to kill you!

28:34.808 --> 28:35.908
Zedd...

28:49.155 --> 28:51.891
<i>I did what I had to do</i>
<i>to protect my family.</i>

28:51.892 --> 28:54.393
I knew you would come
looking for vengeance.

28:54.394 --> 28:57.763
I sealed myself
in my palace with my son.

28:57.764 --> 29:00.599
That's just a story you
made up to justify your crime.

29:00.600 --> 29:02.201
The real reason
you killed my father

29:02.202 --> 29:03.969
is because you feared him.

29:03.970 --> 29:06.605
He was the only man
strong enough

29:06.606 --> 29:08.307
to end the tyranny
of the House of Rahl.

29:08.308 --> 29:10.476
Oh, Zedd,
if it had been about power

29:10.477 --> 29:12.111
I would have found
some way to kill you.

29:12.112 --> 29:14.213
But I didn't.

29:14.214 --> 29:16.081
Why?

29:16.082 --> 29:19.285
Because, old friend,
I loved you.

29:23.556 --> 29:24.957
And I love you still.

29:26.927 --> 29:30.296
Killing your father
was a terrible mistake.

29:30.297 --> 29:33.332
He was right.

29:33.333 --> 29:34.967
I should have killed my son.

29:34.968 --> 29:37.169
If I had done so,
I would have spared the world

29:37.170 --> 29:40.239
all the-the pain and the misery

29:40.240 --> 29:42.408
and the evil that
he has brought into it.

29:44.277 --> 29:50.416
Zedd, you know how hard it was
for me to become a father.

29:50.417 --> 29:55.654
I could not sacrifice
my first-born son.

29:57.290 --> 30:00.893
But I decided
I would correct my mistake

30:00.894 --> 30:03.729
by siring a child

30:03.730 --> 30:05.731
who would destroy Darken Rahl.

30:12.038 --> 30:15.040
That child was you, Richard.

30:16.810 --> 30:18.210
Now, I beg you, son,

30:18.211 --> 30:20.579
please,

30:20.580 --> 30:22.982
let me help you
find the scroll.

30:42.201 --> 30:44.135
Lord Rahl.

30:44.136 --> 30:46.404
Your Sisters slumber
so peacefully

30:46.405 --> 30:48.740
while the Keeper wages war.

30:48.741 --> 30:52.177
Say the word
and I'll rouse them.

30:52.178 --> 30:55.947
The Mother Confessor
and the Seeker

30:55.948 --> 30:58.617
are on their way
to the Winding Wall of Valdaire

30:58.618 --> 31:01.520
in search of an ancient scroll.

31:01.521 --> 31:02.754
You and your Sisters

31:02.755 --> 31:04.656
are to get there
before they arrive.

31:04.657 --> 31:07.559
Lie in wait,
but do not attack

31:07.560 --> 31:10.662
until the Seeker
finds the scroll.

31:10.663 --> 31:14.266
Once he has it,
I want you to steal it.

31:14.267 --> 31:16.768
Why do you want this scroll?

31:16.769 --> 31:18.703
It contains
secret instructions

31:18.704 --> 31:20.705
for the bearer
of the Stone of Tears.

31:20.706 --> 31:22.674
If the Seeker
has this scroll,

31:22.675 --> 31:24.709
he will defeat the Keeper.

31:24.710 --> 31:27.613
Then I will get the scroll
and destroy it.

31:27.614 --> 31:30.316
No. Once you've
taken the scroll,

31:30.286 --> 31:34.356
it is the Keeper's wish that
you protect it with your life.

31:35.357 --> 31:37.726
When you've gotten it safely
away from the Seeker,

31:38.127 --> 31:41.095
I will come and tell you
what to do with it next.

31:44.700 --> 31:47.503
Oh. Yes, one more thing.

31:48.504 --> 31:51.105
There is an aged scholar
traveling with the Seeker

31:51.106 --> 31:53.506
I've sent the wizard Zorander
to kill him

31:54.106 --> 31:56.908
but if for some reason
the Seeker prevents

31:56.909 --> 31:59.077
the Wizard from killing
this old man,

31:59.078 --> 32:02.547
I want you to make
sure that he dies.

32:04.483 --> 32:07.085
My sisters and I
will leave no survivors.

32:07.086 --> 32:09.220
Consider it a victory

32:09.221 --> 32:12.691
if you manage to kill
the old man and get the scroll.

32:14.794 --> 32:16.461
This is the right section.

32:20.967 --> 32:25.437
Now, the key is to read
every fourth symbol.

32:59.205 --> 33:03.008
This scroll belongs
to you, my son.

33:21.127 --> 33:22.727
I've done what I came to do.

33:24.030 --> 33:26.431
I am ready now
to pay for the crime

33:26.432 --> 33:27.399
of killing your father.

33:29.201 --> 33:32.470
May the taking of my life
bring you some measure of peace.

33:35.207 --> 33:36.374
What are you doing? Zedd.

33:40.546 --> 33:42.914
For decades, Panis and I

33:42.915 --> 33:45.583
have been carrying
the same burden of remorse.

33:45.584 --> 33:48.887
If either of us
had listened to Father,

33:48.888 --> 33:50.989
none of this evil would
have ever come to pass.

33:50.990 --> 33:52.991
Not the reign of Darken Rahl,

33:52.992 --> 33:55.660
not the tearing of the veil.

33:55.661 --> 33:58.797
It's time to end
the recriminations.

35:08.601 --> 35:10.535
Kill the old man.

35:28.687 --> 35:31.556
Kahlan! She has the scroll.

35:42.835 --> 35:43.902
Kahlan!

36:23.784 --> 36:25.451
Can you heal him?

36:25.452 --> 36:27.053
I can't remove a Dacra.

36:27.054 --> 36:29.622
It's all right, Zedd.

36:29.623 --> 36:32.124
I have paid for my sins.

36:34.962 --> 36:38.397
And I get to hold
my son's hand

36:38.398 --> 36:40.700
one time before I die.

36:47.174 --> 36:49.208
What more can
a man ask for?

36:51.445 --> 36:54.180
You will find
the scroll again, you--

36:54.181 --> 36:56.682
You will defeat the Keeper.

36:59.920 --> 37:02.021
I wish we had more time.

37:02.022 --> 37:03.990
So do I.

37:06.994 --> 37:07.994
So do I.

37:07.995 --> 37:12.365
But I want you to know, son.

37:12.366 --> 37:16.369
You have been in my heart

37:16.370 --> 37:19.839
from the moment I heard
the Prophecy of your coming.

37:25.078 --> 37:27.613
Zedd, old friend,

37:27.614 --> 37:30.049
I never thought you would
make your peace with me.

37:30.050 --> 37:34.220
I am humbled by your generosity.

37:47.501 --> 37:52.371
It is time for me
to join my other son.

38:11.825 --> 38:13.092
Father.

38:15.762 --> 38:18.497
Do your worst to me, son.

38:18.498 --> 38:19.699
I am ready.

38:19.700 --> 38:21.067
Rise.

38:33.313 --> 38:35.614
I forgive you, Father.

38:40.587 --> 38:42.355
Do you forgive me?

38:46.326 --> 38:48.160
She took the scroll that way.

38:50.197 --> 38:52.264
Home is in that direction.

38:52.265 --> 38:55.801
I'm sorry I couldn't
go through with it.

38:57.304 --> 38:59.538
I think Father would
have been proud of you.

38:59.539 --> 39:00.639
Hm.

39:21.228 --> 39:25.931
Why didn't you ever tell me that
Panis Rahl killed your father?

39:25.932 --> 39:30.636
Maybe because all of the evil
we've been fighting for so long

39:30.637 --> 39:32.438
is my fault.

39:32.439 --> 39:34.940
Because you wouldn't
listen to your father?

39:34.941 --> 39:37.710
Because you let
Panis trick you?

39:39.312 --> 39:41.380
It's time to let
go of that, Zedd.

39:45.986 --> 39:47.753
Richard.

39:49.723 --> 39:52.758
There's something else
I've never told you.

39:52.759 --> 39:54.193
Or anyone.

39:54.194 --> 39:58.130
The first lesson my father
ever taught me

39:58.131 --> 40:01.567
was that a Wizard commits
his greatest crime

40:01.568 --> 40:04.437
not when he attempts
to do the work of the Keeper.

40:04.438 --> 40:07.606
<i>The greatest sin of all</i>

40:07.607 --> 40:11.844
<i>is when a Wizard attempts</i>
<i>to do the work of the Creator.</i>

40:11.845 --> 40:14.447
What's wrong, My Lord?

40:15.916 --> 40:18.350
I have a problem.

40:18.351 --> 40:21.020
Of personal nature.

40:23.690 --> 40:26.692
Although the queen and I
have tried for years,

40:26.693 --> 40:30.262
we have been unable to achieve
our greatest dream:

40:30.263 --> 40:35.868
to produce an heir
to the throne of D'Hara.

40:35.869 --> 40:38.871
As I have not fathered a child
with any of the concubines

40:38.872 --> 40:41.240
that I have taken to my bed,

40:41.241 --> 40:44.743
I know the failure
lies not with the queen

40:44.744 --> 40:46.111
but with me.

40:49.716 --> 40:52.284
If you help me with this,
Zeddicus,

40:52.285 --> 40:53.719
I will raise you up.

40:55.555 --> 40:57.957
I will make you
First Wizard of all D'Hara.

41:00.894 --> 41:03.496
You will have
greater influence

41:03.497 --> 41:05.898
than any Wizard
who has ever lived.

41:37.731 --> 41:39.598
You will beget a son.

41:41.101 --> 41:45.104
I unleashed the greatest evil
the world has ever known.

41:50.176 --> 41:53.112
Without me,
there'd be no Darken Rahl.

41:56.783 --> 41:58.984
Zedd,
if you hadn't helped Panis,

41:58.985 --> 42:00.920
I wouldn't have
been born either.

42:00.921 --> 42:03.856
Still.

42:03.857 --> 42:06.692
I can never forgive myself.

42:11.598 --> 42:13.933
I know what it's like to doubt
yourself at every turn,

42:13.934 --> 42:17.536
but I've realized that
if I stop and question

42:17.537 --> 42:19.505
every decision I make
I'll never get anywhere.

42:23.643 --> 42:27.646
All we can do is make
the best choices we can

42:27.647 --> 42:30.950
and keep putting one foot
in front of the other.
