02:54.385 --> 02:56.785
Paging Dr. Black,
please report to IC.

02:58.097 --> 02:59.665
Dr. Black to IC.

03:23.634 --> 03:25.297
- Hello?
- Going down.

03:56.753 --> 03:59.537
Going down.

05:26.706 --> 05:29.905
You need to press
the button, Mommy.

05:44.593 --> 05:46.002
Sorry, is this the year

05:46.065 --> 05:48.113
that I'm supposed to
have a party or not?

05:49.201 --> 05:51.601
No, sweetie, you
know the drill.

05:51.666 --> 05:52.977
It's only every second year,

05:53.041 --> 05:54.737
that makes the
party more special.

05:54.801 --> 05:57.713
Oh yeah, but what did
we do when I was seven?

05:57.777 --> 06:00.049
You don't remember
your cooking party?

06:00.114 --> 06:01.713
You all made those
fabulous cakes,

06:01.777 --> 06:03.697
and you chose all the colors
to put into the dough,

06:03.762 --> 06:05.361
and then everybody sang to you.

06:05.425 --> 06:08.337
Oh, yeah, Saskia cried
because her butterfly broke

06:08.401 --> 06:10.674
when the lady took
it out of the oven.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.658
But then everybody laughed
when the balloon popped

06:12.721 --> 06:13.681
and she dropped the whole tray.

06:13.746 --> 06:14.897
Yeah, that was funny.

06:17.202 --> 06:19.345
But what did we
do when I was six?

06:22.002 --> 06:23.250
You remember, you and
Daddy and I went out

06:23.314 --> 06:25.138
for pizza, remember?

06:25.201 --> 06:26.610
Daddy drank too much beer

06:26.673 --> 06:29.234
and made the whole
restaurant sing to me.

06:29.297 --> 06:30.961
Oh yeah, daddy loved his beer.

06:31.026 --> 06:33.393
Did I have a party
when I was five?

06:33.457 --> 06:37.201
Well, yes you did, but it
was mainly grown ups, I think.

06:37.266 --> 06:38.418
Your cousins might
have been there.

06:38.482 --> 06:40.561
But did I have fun?

06:40.626 --> 06:44.146
I think so, I think, I hope.

06:45.394 --> 06:46.673
You had a beautiful
fairy costume.

06:46.737 --> 06:48.338
What did we do
when I was four?

06:48.402 --> 06:50.002
Oh, honey, I don't
think I can remember four.

06:50.065 --> 06:51.729
What about three?

06:51.793 --> 06:52.882
I don't know.

06:52.945 --> 06:56.337
How about two?

06:56.401 --> 06:58.034
- Two?
- Or one, Mommy.

06:58.097 --> 07:00.210
What did we do when I was one?

07:00.273 --> 07:03.505
Yes one, I
remember you at one.

07:05.041 --> 07:07.282
There were people everywhere
and you were so little,

07:07.345 --> 07:09.009
I didn't notice where you
were because I was too busy

07:09.073 --> 07:10.066
looking after them.

07:11.281 --> 07:12.497
But then I realized
that you were gone

07:12.561 --> 07:13.553
and I couldn't find you.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.337
We were so worried but
then just we discovered

07:16.401 --> 07:18.130
you'd gotten a book and
crawled down the hallway.

07:18.194 --> 07:19.185
Was I hiding?

07:20.401 --> 07:22.290
I think you'd just
gotten sick of us.

07:22.353 --> 07:23.442
You're funny, Mommy.

07:23.506 --> 07:25.073
How could I ever
get sick of you?

08:10.321 --> 08:12.498
Going up.

09:02.257 --> 09:05.425
Herb?

09:07.506 --> 09:08.498
Herb?

09:18.513 --> 09:23.313
Joan?

09:30.066 --> 09:31.057
Joan!

09:54.193 --> 09:55.538
Earthcare meeting's tonight.

09:56.946 --> 09:59.058
I promised the Wilsons
we'd both be there?

10:06.834 --> 10:08.337
It'll be good for you, Herbie.

10:14.161 --> 10:16.690
I'll see ya tonight,
kiss for luck?

10:48.402 --> 10:51.090
How's she looking today, Herb?

10:51.154 --> 10:52.401
Today's the day.

10:54.098 --> 10:55.698
I thought yesterday
was the day.

10:57.457 --> 10:59.665
Too choppy, today.

11:00.625 --> 11:01.618
Hear that, Mick?

11:03.121 --> 11:06.450
Them maids, they don't like
it when it's too choppy.

11:34.705 --> 11:37.777
All right, Herb,
we'll see ya tomorrow.

12:22.705 --> 12:23.889
Shit.

13:42.802 --> 13:45.137
I told you I wouldn't be long.

14:11.858 --> 14:15.538
Now, how are we supposed
to be friends, eh?

14:27.922 --> 14:29.393
The old
leaves turn yellow.

14:29.457 --> 14:31.537
And that's because the
magnesium is moving...

15:37.681 --> 15:41.106
Shit, Joanie, you
gave me a heart attack.

15:43.313 --> 15:44.914
You missed the
meeting tonight.

15:46.193 --> 15:47.185
Tide was in.

15:48.914 --> 15:49.905
It's after dark.

15:55.825 --> 15:56.817
Bed time.

15:58.897 --> 16:01.298
This mermaid shit has to stop.

16:06.034 --> 16:07.090
Okay, okay.

16:18.801 --> 16:19.953
No more fishing.

17:18.512 --> 17:20.689
45 seconds, that's better.

17:42.513 --> 17:45.489
It's all right,
Joanie, I've got it.

17:58.801 --> 18:01.938
Okay, so you're not
a greens girl, then.

18:27.314 --> 18:28.593
Don't be like that.

18:32.978 --> 18:35.185
You have to eat, princess.

19:30.961 --> 19:31.953
Herb?

19:35.281 --> 19:36.274
Herb?

20:31.602 --> 20:32.593
Sorry.

20:34.417 --> 20:35.377
Oh my god.

20:50.226 --> 20:51.985
What have you done?

20:55.666 --> 20:58.161
Ain't she a beauty?

20:58.225 --> 21:00.049
You're sick, Herb!

21:00.113 --> 21:02.353
Do you hear me, you're sick!

21:04.113 --> 21:05.169
What are you doing?

21:05.233 --> 21:06.226
She'll bite.

21:07.697 --> 21:09.009
She won't bite.

21:10.066 --> 21:12.306
You're sick, can't you see?

21:14.226 --> 21:16.018
What do you mean she's sick?

21:22.513 --> 21:24.017
Fresh water, of course.

21:25.681 --> 21:27.889
I've gotta get her to
salt water or she'll die.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.674
Move!

21:30.737 --> 21:31.825
Shit, Joanie!

21:35.154 --> 21:36.145
Shh.

22:08.401 --> 22:09.810
Now, now, beauty.

22:11.922 --> 22:13.073
No more tears.

22:22.354 --> 22:23.826
We're going home.

29:59.154 --> 30:01.457
Clara.

30:07.633 --> 30:08.626
Clara.

30:38.706 --> 30:40.081
Is anybody there?

30:41.682 --> 30:44.113
What
frightens you the most?

30:44.178 --> 30:46.098
Please, I
don't wanna talk about it.

30:46.162 --> 30:47.281
Now.

30:47.346 --> 30:50.866
What lies beyond the shadows.

30:53.521 --> 30:57.074
Nothing but my own
demons to torment me.

31:00.818 --> 31:01.810
Dying alone.

31:03.698 --> 31:06.897
We have to accept our fate.

31:08.657 --> 31:12.241
And know that no one will
ever truly understand.

31:12.306 --> 31:14.258
Excellent, Tamsin.

31:14.322 --> 31:17.617
As always, vulnerability.

31:17.682 --> 31:20.914
Come on, I'll take
you out the back.

31:20.978 --> 31:23.538
No, thank you.

31:46.193 --> 31:48.818
It's very, it's
very hot in here.

31:52.626 --> 31:53.937
This place has the
only chef in the country

31:54.001 --> 31:55.602
trying to serve pufferfish.

31:55.665 --> 31:57.649
- I know.
- Have you had it before?

31:57.713 --> 31:58.833
No, never.

32:00.434 --> 32:03.633
Kind of thrilling, the
unknown, don't you think?

32:03.697 --> 32:05.649
If you reckon we're in
safe hands with this chef,

32:05.713 --> 32:06.706
then I'll trust you.

32:08.914 --> 32:10.674
Can you just excuse
me for a second.

32:24.817 --> 32:28.497
I can't hear
it, louder please?

33:00.402 --> 33:03.857
That's
her, that's Tamsin.

33:11.378 --> 33:13.105
Is that her boyfriend?

33:16.722 --> 33:18.034
How can you stand it?

33:19.185 --> 33:21.169
When they stop
staring, I've failed.

33:21.233 --> 33:22.738
Well, I can't do it.

33:22.801 --> 33:24.337
- Not anymore.
- Again, darling?

33:24.402 --> 33:25.937
Come on, we can work it out.

33:26.001 --> 33:28.945
Not now, I'll
come around later.

33:51.698 --> 33:53.329
I thought I had time.

33:53.394 --> 33:55.378
That you didn't
need me until later.

33:55.441 --> 33:57.777
He didn't want me.

33:57.841 --> 33:59.730
Oh, Miss Tamsin.

34:02.034 --> 34:03.025
I need you now.

34:04.722 --> 34:05.713
Polly!

34:23.985 --> 34:24.978
Enough.

35:10.066 --> 35:14.194
Wake up, wake up!

35:14.258 --> 35:16.497
Miss Tamsin.

35:16.561 --> 35:18.289
I'm so sorry.

35:18.353 --> 35:20.050
I swear if you
ever do that again,

35:20.114 --> 35:22.770
I will tell them where you are.

35:22.834 --> 35:24.529
Please, don't.

35:26.865 --> 35:30.674
Shut up.

35:57.745 --> 36:00.114
Madam, may I rest now?

36:01.042 --> 36:02.034
She'll be fine.

36:03.218 --> 36:04.210
Shoo.

36:11.442 --> 36:13.009
Been thinking
about this all night.

36:14.257 --> 36:16.913
When it's just us, it's
amazing, it really is.

36:16.977 --> 36:19.697
But it's almost never like that.

36:21.617 --> 36:22.962
To wake up next to the
person that you love,

36:23.026 --> 36:24.978
that's not so much to ask.

36:25.042 --> 36:26.577
You don't understand.

36:31.825 --> 36:33.810
- You can't leave me.
- Sorry.

36:34.866 --> 36:36.562
No, no you can't.

36:36.625 --> 36:38.674
Polly!
You can't I'll die!

36:40.113 --> 36:42.961
Really, Tamsin,
you're better than this.

36:43.026 --> 36:45.330
No.

36:45.394 --> 36:49.138
Polly!

36:49.201 --> 36:50.194
Polly, Polly!

36:53.553 --> 36:54.546
Polly!

38:37.105 --> 38:38.097
No one home.

39:03.217 --> 39:05.106
Celia, what's wrong, girl?

39:18.001 --> 39:20.177
- What you looking at?
- Nothing, Grandad.

39:31.282 --> 39:32.850
One story now, Gran.

39:32.913 --> 39:35.250
Please, tell us a scary
one for the mangrove woman.

39:35.314 --> 39:37.170
Why don't you tell the story?

39:37.234 --> 39:38.577
You know it off by heart now.

39:41.938 --> 39:44.722
Well, the Gooynbooyn woman

39:44.785 --> 39:49.458
is older than
Granny's Gran's Gran.

39:49.522 --> 39:53.458
She has sharp teeth and
yellow eyes that glow.

39:53.521 --> 39:56.242
She is proper stinking.

39:56.305 --> 39:58.194
She is covered in
mud and leaves,

39:58.258 --> 40:01.298
and her hair is all knotty.

40:01.362 --> 40:06.130
She got big nyanyas that go
all the way down to her knees.

40:08.914 --> 40:10.642
She always cry all the
time 'cause they heavy

40:10.705 --> 40:12.210
and full of milk,

40:12.273 --> 40:14.993
so she steals kids
away to drink her milk.

40:15.057 --> 40:19.249
But they never come back,
cause she eats them.

40:20.338 --> 40:22.033
She doesn't eat them.

40:22.098 --> 40:24.370
She puts them in a hole and
keeps them there forever.

40:24.434 --> 40:27.377
And her eyes are
black, not yellow.

40:27.441 --> 40:29.778
She does so eat them, stupid.

40:29.842 --> 40:31.217
Okay, stop it now.

40:31.281 --> 40:33.169
Don't go talking
about her anymore.

40:33.233 --> 40:34.353
Or she'll come for you.

40:34.417 --> 40:37.329
Err, she not real anyways.

40:37.393 --> 40:39.570
Miss reckons you tell
us kids that story

40:39.634 --> 40:41.202
to keep us out of the Mangroves.

40:41.266 --> 40:43.153
Well, that Miss teacher
woman wouldn't know.

40:43.218 --> 40:44.434
She never see one, eh?

40:44.498 --> 40:46.514
What, you seen one, Gran?

40:46.577 --> 40:48.178
Never mind what I seen.

40:48.241 --> 40:49.809
No more stories now.

40:49.873 --> 40:53.329
Go on, play, enough light
there now, go on, get.

40:55.345 --> 40:56.337
Go on.

41:03.186 --> 41:04.690
Why you gotta lie like,

41:04.754 --> 41:06.001
like you know what the
Gooynbooyn looks like?

41:06.066 --> 41:07.378
I'm not lying.

41:07.441 --> 41:09.234
Oh what, you seen her, eh?

41:09.298 --> 41:10.290
I don't know.

41:11.314 --> 41:13.234
- Well, when then?
- Today.

41:14.481 --> 41:16.050
Err, you's a liar.

41:16.914 --> 41:18.642
Show me then, big shot.

41:18.706 --> 41:20.209
I don't want to.

41:20.273 --> 41:21.393
That's 'cause you liar.

41:21.457 --> 41:22.994
No, I'm not.

41:23.089 --> 41:26.001
- Oh what, you scared?
- No.

41:26.065 --> 41:27.090
Well, show me then.

41:39.537 --> 41:40.818
Jhi, it's gonna be dark soon.

41:40.882 --> 41:42.353
I'll show it tomorrow, eh?

41:42.417 --> 41:44.370
No, I wanna look now.
It's more scary.

41:44.433 --> 41:46.002
It's more stupid.

41:46.065 --> 41:48.049
Stop being such a
scared-y cat, scared-y cat.

41:48.113 --> 41:49.937
When we find her,
what if we she grabs us.

41:50.001 --> 41:52.177
She'll grab you first
'cause I'm too fast.

41:52.242 --> 41:53.809
In your dreams.

41:53.873 --> 41:56.209
See, she'll get you
first 'cause you too slow.

41:56.274 --> 41:59.250
Nah, she'll grab you
because you're a boy.

42:10.482 --> 42:15.313
Jhi?

42:28.114 --> 42:29.106
Jhi?

42:42.737 --> 42:43.729
Jhi?

42:51.922 --> 42:52.914
Jhi?

43:04.434 --> 43:05.425
Jhi!

43:14.833 --> 43:16.337
Jhi, where are you?

43:20.946 --> 43:21.938
Jhi!

43:42.994 --> 43:46.353
Celia?

43:48.466 --> 43:50.674
- Celia?
- Grandad, Jhi, Jhi.

43:51.953 --> 43:55.249
I couldn't find him,
I looked and looked.

46:04.753 --> 46:06.353
Jhi, Jhi!

46:39.505 --> 46:40.498
No, no.

47:35.986 --> 47:37.553
- Where you going, mate?
- Town.

47:37.617 --> 47:39.570
Me too, jump in.

47:51.217 --> 47:52.434
This is great,

47:52.498 --> 47:53.714
I thought it was
gonna take me ages

47:53.777 --> 47:55.218
to get a ride all
the way to town.

47:55.282 --> 47:56.594
Fantastic, thank you.

47:56.657 --> 47:57.937
This is your lucky day.

48:05.265 --> 48:06.898
What's in town?

48:06.961 --> 48:09.649
I'm going back to uni,
it's my final year at last.

48:10.674 --> 48:12.818
- What are you studying?
- Science.

48:14.065 --> 48:16.817
Oh, I got a brainiac
in the car, I'm honored.

48:16.881 --> 48:18.801
Well, you gotta study
something, don't you?

48:18.865 --> 48:19.857
Do you?

48:28.593 --> 48:30.609
Did you see the
Blues game last week?

48:32.241 --> 48:34.962
- They lost, I think.
- You think?

48:35.025 --> 48:36.337
They bloody thrashed 'em.

48:37.554 --> 48:38.834
I mean the Lions
scored more points,

48:38.897 --> 48:40.977
but they didn't beat them.

48:41.041 --> 48:42.833
What was the score,
nine to seven.

48:44.434 --> 48:46.641
Their points, their nine
points were all penalties.

48:46.705 --> 48:47.730
That's not winning.

48:49.617 --> 48:52.882
No, in my opinion the
Blues won that game.

48:52.945 --> 48:57.330
And Beckett, can he
swerve, man, can he swerve.

48:57.393 --> 49:01.233
I mean, to be able to
swerve at that speed,

49:01.297 --> 49:03.794
I mean, that's what
Beckett can do.

49:04.913 --> 49:05.905
He's good, all right.

49:07.057 --> 49:08.817
So what do you think
about Moster then?

49:08.881 --> 49:11.281
You can't play
scrum-half with a fat tail.

49:11.346 --> 49:12.882
And why is he always
talking to the pack?

49:12.946 --> 49:15.314
What does he think he's
captain or something?

49:15.377 --> 49:19.154
But Davies, Davies,
there's a Blue's boy,

49:20.754 --> 49:22.065
and you know what that means.

49:24.786 --> 49:26.130
Many black girls there?

49:27.794 --> 49:29.394
At your school?

49:29.458 --> 49:30.610
- What?
- Black girls.

49:31.793 --> 49:33.394
Black girls are hot.

49:33.458 --> 49:35.857
Much better in bed than
white girls, let me tell you.

49:37.938 --> 49:40.369
Come on, stop looking so green.

49:40.433 --> 49:41.874
You uni types are all the same.

49:43.281 --> 49:44.337
I know you kids.

49:52.113 --> 49:53.298
Did you ever sleep
with a black girl?

49:53.362 --> 49:54.354
No.

49:55.986 --> 49:57.745
- You sure?
- Yes.

50:01.394 --> 50:03.473
Come on, get out of
the way you chinky!

50:04.978 --> 50:07.090
Jesus Christ!

50:07.154 --> 50:09.393
Oh my God, Oh my God!

50:13.905 --> 50:14.897
Come on.

50:16.913 --> 50:19.441
Is he dead, is he dead?

50:19.506 --> 50:20.689
We've got to take
him to a hospital.

50:20.753 --> 50:22.321
Why, he's dead.

50:22.386 --> 50:24.978
Grab his legs, let me
reverse the car, hang on.

50:37.618 --> 50:38.674
Jesus Christ.

50:59.858 --> 51:01.650
Grab his legs.

51:01.714 --> 51:03.217
- But we gotta take him to a police station.
- Police station?

51:04.017 --> 51:05.458
Bloody mad?

51:05.521 --> 51:06.801
Let's just find a place
to bury this thing.

51:06.865 --> 51:08.274
Bury it?

51:08.338 --> 51:09.937
Why do you look
so stupid, mate?

51:11.058 --> 51:12.849
Do you not understand
the word bury?

51:14.577 --> 51:17.041
You can't just bury that man.

51:17.106 --> 51:18.257
No, we have to report
this to the police.

51:18.321 --> 51:20.082
What about his relatives?

51:20.145 --> 51:24.049
Look, do you wanna get back
to the city tonight or not?

51:24.113 --> 51:25.842
Of course I do, but that's
not exactly the point, is it?

51:25.905 --> 51:29.714
All we need to do is explain
to the police that it was cold,

51:29.777 --> 51:31.474
he was wearing dark clothes.

51:31.538 --> 51:34.002
If we go to the police,
we're gonna be there all night.

51:34.066 --> 51:37.330
Filling out paperwork, making
statements, and whatnot.

51:37.394 --> 51:40.114
I might even have to go to
court and pay a fine, not you.

51:40.178 --> 51:41.938
Look, happened to a
friend of mine once...

51:42.001 --> 51:43.890
You can't just
kill a human being!

51:43.954 --> 51:44.946
You said kill.

51:49.393 --> 51:52.881
He stepped out into the road
in front of the bloody car.

51:52.945 --> 51:54.578
He killed himself, mate.

51:54.642 --> 51:55.634
And you know it.

51:57.073 --> 51:58.609
You making me out
to be a killer?

52:00.561 --> 52:02.034
No, no of course not.

52:02.098 --> 52:04.178
No, you mustn't say
things like that, mate.

52:05.457 --> 52:07.090
You'll just make
me bloody cross.

52:13.937 --> 52:17.905
Right, let's get rid
of it, then we can go.

52:23.857 --> 52:24.849
Get in.

52:53.138 --> 52:55.729
I've got a shovel in the back.

53:52.402 --> 53:54.162
What you looking at?

53:54.226 --> 53:55.218
Nothing.

53:56.146 --> 53:57.777
Right, let's go.

55:16.337 --> 55:18.834
Oh god, it's so
good to see you.

55:18.898 --> 55:22.674
I missed you, you
freak.

55:22.738 --> 55:24.017
I have to talk to you.

55:24.081 --> 55:26.130
Thank god you're here.

55:26.193 --> 55:29.169
Okay, one sec, my dad's
just gone dropped off my bike.

55:29.233 --> 55:30.354
He's just around the corner.

55:32.274 --> 55:33.298
Look there he is.

55:33.361 --> 55:34.929
This is great, you can meet him.

55:34.993 --> 55:35.986
He's gonna love you.

55:53.905 --> 55:57.873
Dad?

55:57.937 --> 56:01.809
Who is this?

56:01.873 --> 56:04.337
Do you wanna get
back to the city tonight or not?

56:12.017 --> 56:13.937
Chinky.

56:15.953 --> 56:17.425
Help, help, help!

56:22.098 --> 56:27.090
Help.

56:37.426 --> 56:40.594
Clara, I'm here.

56:47.378 --> 56:52.369
You need to finish it.

01:06:50.417 --> 01:06:53.106
I'm gonna finish
it, I promise.

01:06:58.866 --> 01:06:59.858
I promise.

01:08:13.041 --> 01:08:14.033
And in local news,

01:08:14.097 --> 01:08:15.570
police have identified the man...

01:08:17.041 --> 01:08:18.481
Suspected vampire
attack in Hobart.

01:08:18.546 --> 01:08:21.073
28-year old Marco
Benatachi of West Hobart

01:08:21.138 --> 01:08:24.529
was found this morning in an
alleyway in the city center.

01:08:24.593 --> 01:08:27.377
Police are calling for
witnesses to come forward.

01:08:45.585 --> 01:08:47.761
Do you do this
sort of thing often?

01:08:47.826 --> 01:08:49.617
I have tried.

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:54.673
You seem so friendly here,
but my bed, it stays empty.

01:08:57.778 --> 01:08:59.024
Must be pretty lonely, eh?

01:09:11.122 --> 01:09:13.969
This is one of my
favorite places here.

01:09:14.033 --> 01:09:17.234
It is so bold.

01:09:18.577 --> 01:09:21.010
Nah, the one in
the city is better.

01:09:21.073 --> 01:09:22.193
It's got cherubs and shit.

01:09:24.497 --> 01:09:25.488
You'd like that one.

01:10:43.921 --> 01:10:44.977
Beautiful, isn't it?

01:10:47.857 --> 01:10:49.746
Yes, she is.

01:10:50.962 --> 01:10:52.497
I was talking about the knife.

01:10:53.457 --> 01:10:55.026
Such gorgeous efficiency.

01:10:57.201 --> 01:11:01.778
Yes, but also it is not safe.

01:11:03.282 --> 01:11:05.010
A dangerous beauty indeed.

01:11:25.618 --> 01:11:27.857
You're not afraid of a
little suction, are you?

01:11:27.921 --> 01:11:30.033
- Mm-mm.
- I didn't think so.

01:11:34.673 --> 01:11:38.737
Just relax, a woman like
you deserves my best.

01:13:06.354 --> 01:13:09.841
You're a Libra?

01:13:09.906 --> 01:13:14.769
Yes, you, young lady holding
the Congan fertility mask.

01:13:18.353 --> 01:13:21.553
- You're a Libra?
- I'm a Virgo.

01:13:30.961 --> 01:13:32.209
How much for this plant?

01:13:32.274 --> 01:13:34.929
It is not a mere plant.

01:13:36.241 --> 01:13:40.849
It is Devil's Blossom,
AKA, horrificus serrulata,

01:13:42.034 --> 01:13:44.818
a delicious but
feisty edible begonia.

01:13:46.417 --> 01:13:50.738
Hardly suitable for a
sloppy careless little girl.

01:13:50.802 --> 01:13:53.394
Okay, you don't know
anything about me.

01:13:53.458 --> 01:13:56.178
You're just some creep that
runs a pathetic junk shop.

01:13:58.418 --> 01:14:03.186
Let me get you a nice little
succulent from out back.

01:14:56.785 --> 01:14:58.034
Hey, Maeve?

01:14:59.826 --> 01:15:01.266
Would you like a Billy, Maeve?

01:15:03.442 --> 01:15:05.905
- No.
- How 'bout a nang, Maeve?

01:15:07.441 --> 01:15:09.554
- No.
- You want a beer then, Maeve?

01:15:09.617 --> 01:15:12.978
You reckon you can keep this
up until the Halloween party?

01:15:13.042 --> 01:15:14.577
It's only like 10:30, Maeve.

01:15:16.433 --> 01:15:17.425
It's five o'clock.

01:15:20.337 --> 01:15:22.738
- Where'd you get that weird plant?
- You'll love this.

01:15:22.801 --> 01:15:24.210
I racked it from some
crusty, misogynist...

01:15:24.273 --> 01:15:25.650
Oh, no, no, no.

01:15:25.714 --> 01:15:27.313
I don't trust any of
that organic shit.

01:15:27.378 --> 01:15:29.618
Yeah, well since you
dickheads moved in,

01:15:29.682 --> 01:15:31.218
I don't think I've seen
you eat one vegetable.

01:15:31.282 --> 01:15:33.585
Hey, we had pasta last night.

01:15:33.649 --> 01:15:36.241
Organic stuff's got all
these toxins in the soil.

01:15:36.306 --> 01:15:37.969
It's pretty much just
from the corporations...

01:15:38.034 --> 01:15:39.473
You don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

01:15:39.537 --> 01:15:41.010
Put poison into the
water supply, you know?

01:15:41.074 --> 01:15:42.769
It's pretty much just
this big conspiracy

01:15:42.834 --> 01:15:45.778
between the farmers, and
Monsanto, and Woollie's.

01:15:51.762 --> 01:15:54.481
And that is why I
only smoke hydro.

01:15:54.546 --> 01:15:57.873
You only smoke hydro because
you're a filthy bong rat.

01:15:57.937 --> 01:16:00.657
You know there's nothing
wrong with a couple of cones.

01:16:00.721 --> 01:16:02.513
Yeah okay, it's not about
whether you smoke weed

01:16:02.577 --> 01:16:04.274
or eat organic, it's just
about being aware of the shit

01:16:04.337 --> 01:16:05.393
that you put into your body.

01:16:05.457 --> 01:16:06.930
You sound like my mom, Maeve.

01:16:09.426 --> 01:16:11.153
If you get fucked up all
the time and eat crap food

01:16:11.217 --> 01:16:12.498
it's gonna kill you.

01:16:12.562 --> 01:16:14.097
Okay, let's just
chill out, huh?

01:16:15.378 --> 01:16:17.010
Please don't tell
me to fucking chill.

01:16:19.122 --> 01:16:20.530
Maeve?

01:16:20.594 --> 01:16:21.585
Maeve?

01:16:40.177 --> 01:16:42.865
Do you think Maeve would be
mad if we drank her smoothie?

01:16:43.761 --> 01:16:47.410
Probably.

01:16:47.474 --> 01:16:48.465
Yup.

01:17:08.434 --> 01:17:13.330
To good times, good housemates
and below average health.

01:17:14.258 --> 01:17:15.377
And a very vegan Halloween.

01:17:21.906 --> 01:17:23.185
Not a bad drop.

01:17:35.537 --> 01:17:36.529
Oye, oye.

01:21:17.553 --> 01:21:20.145
Keep going.

01:23:04.945 --> 01:23:05.970
This is Zoe Harris.

01:23:06.033 --> 01:23:07.857
Can I speak to Detective Warner?

01:23:07.921 --> 01:23:09.169
I'm sorry, Ms. Harris.

01:23:09.234 --> 01:23:10.897
He's been called
out to an emergency.

01:23:10.962 --> 01:23:12.434
This is an emergency.

01:23:14.898 --> 01:23:15.889
He's back.

01:23:18.321 --> 01:23:20.754
Has he attempted to
gain entry to your premises?

01:23:20.818 --> 01:23:22.834
Not yet, but I
thought I'd call you now

01:23:22.898 --> 01:23:24.433
because I'll be a little busy

01:23:24.498 --> 01:23:25.554
when he's got his hands
wrapped around my throat.

01:23:25.618 --> 01:23:27.794
Okay, okay.

01:23:28.081 --> 01:23:30.289
I'll send a car around
to check it out.

01:23:30.354 --> 01:23:32.850
Thank you, and please
ask Detective Warner

01:23:32.913 --> 01:23:34.066
to call me urgently.

01:24:20.401 --> 01:24:23.665
Zoe, is that you?

01:24:25.585 --> 01:24:26.833
It's me, Angela.

01:24:34.674 --> 01:24:36.818
You scared the hell out of me.

01:24:36.882 --> 01:24:37.969
What are you doing here?

01:24:38.033 --> 01:24:39.730
I'm sorry, I had to see you.

01:24:40.881 --> 01:24:42.450
Can you open the door please?

01:24:48.978 --> 01:24:51.377
You haven't changed at all.

01:24:52.882 --> 01:24:54.706
Is train wreck the
latest look of the A-list?

01:24:56.177 --> 01:24:57.874
Some jerk cut in front of me.

01:25:00.594 --> 01:25:02.449
You should go to hospital,
get that checked out.

01:25:02.514 --> 01:25:04.081
I've already been.

01:25:04.146 --> 01:25:07.089
Can I come in please, I
really need to talk to you.

01:25:07.153 --> 01:25:09.073
- There's nothing left to say.
- I haven't said sorry.

01:25:12.145 --> 01:25:13.873
Please.

01:25:16.626 --> 01:25:18.130
Just don't bleed
all over my floor.

01:25:38.417 --> 01:25:39.793
It's so good to see you.

01:25:39.858 --> 01:25:41.842
Were you on the
front lawn earlier?

01:25:41.905 --> 01:25:44.914
Yeah, been trying to
get your attention for.

01:25:49.041 --> 01:25:50.033
I just.

01:25:50.993 --> 01:25:52.498
It's probably shock, sit down.

01:25:53.425 --> 01:25:55.314
I'll make you some tea.

01:26:03.601 --> 01:26:04.593
Hello?

01:26:07.313 --> 01:26:08.305
Hello?

01:28:19.825 --> 01:28:21.554
If I'd known you were coming,

01:28:21.649 --> 01:28:23.730
I would've taken the Royal
Doulton out of the dishwasher.

01:28:29.905 --> 01:28:31.633
Why are you here?

01:28:31.698 --> 01:28:34.065
Tonight, I realized
what's really important.

01:28:36.273 --> 01:28:38.578
And I needed to tell
you how sorry I am.

01:28:40.081 --> 01:28:42.097
I'm just supposed to
forget about you ditching me

01:28:42.162 --> 01:28:43.570
when a better offer came along?

01:28:50.354 --> 01:28:52.178
You were my best friend.

01:28:54.865 --> 01:28:56.305
I don't expect you to forget,

01:28:58.193 --> 01:29:00.273
but I'm not leaving
until you forgive me.

01:29:01.618 --> 01:29:04.242
I have to get that.

01:29:04.306 --> 01:29:05.937
It's probably the police.

01:29:06.001 --> 01:29:07.697
- The police?
- Long story.

01:29:09.106 --> 01:29:11.250
Please don't go down there.

01:29:13.201 --> 01:29:14.833
I'll be right back.

01:29:20.466 --> 01:29:21.457
Hello?

01:29:22.482 --> 01:29:23.473
Hello?

01:29:26.033 --> 01:29:29.394
Hello, not again!

01:29:30.674 --> 01:29:32.594
Shit.

01:29:32.657 --> 01:29:34.129
Shit, shit, shit.

01:30:31.506 --> 01:30:33.074
I am so sorry.

01:30:36.914 --> 01:30:38.193
I forgive you.

01:30:40.113 --> 01:30:42.930
After all, life's too short.

01:30:52.146 --> 01:30:54.353
Last time, I promise.

01:30:54.417 --> 01:30:56.658
Then I'm all yours.

01:31:15.985 --> 01:31:16.978
Hello?

01:31:17.905 --> 01:31:20.114
Can I speak
to Zoe please?

01:31:20.177 --> 01:31:21.874
This is Zoe.

01:31:21.938 --> 01:31:26.257
I'm ringing on
behalf of Angela's parents.

01:31:26.322 --> 01:31:29.233
There's been a
terrible accident.

01:31:37.298 --> 01:31:38.290
I'm so sorry.

01:31:39.505 --> 01:31:41.970
Yes, they did
everything they could

01:31:42.034 --> 01:31:44.689
but Angela died a few hours ago.

01:31:55.793 --> 01:31:56.785
I know.

01:31:59.761 --> 01:32:02.098
But will you tell her
parents something for me?

01:32:03.377 --> 01:32:05.234
Yes, of course.

01:32:07.537 --> 01:32:08.978
Please tell them not to worry.

01:32:11.538 --> 01:32:12.754
We'll look after each other.

01:32:32.978 --> 01:32:34.866
It's time to go, Zoe.

01:32:58.546 --> 01:33:01.746
Clara, it's okay.

01:33:04.434 --> 01:33:07.634
When in darkness,
hold onto the light.

01:33:12.274 --> 01:33:14.610
I'll always be here with you.

01:33:57.562 --> 01:34:02.562

What frightens you the most?
