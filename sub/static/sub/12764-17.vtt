00:00.898 --> 00:02.832
<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:02.900 --> 00:05.061
I got accepted to a music program.

00:05.102 --> 00:09.869
I leave in two days. I'll call and text,
and I'll come back to you.

00:09.907 --> 00:13.536
<i>The two of you used to play that song
all the time. She Could Be You.</i>

00:13.577 --> 00:15.943
- Third row, fourth down.
- Not there.

00:15.980 --> 00:18.881
The song on the jukebox?

00:18.916 --> 00:21.317
D4.
You didn't tell me you were coming.

00:21.386 --> 00:25.447
- No one knows. I'm surprising my mom.
- You will not see or speak to Amanda

00:25.490 --> 00:28.323
until she's back where
she belongs at that school.

00:28.360 --> 00:31.158
You'll have 20 bubbleheads
lined up by tomorrow.

00:31.196 --> 00:34.825
- They have the same thing against them.
- What's that?

00:34.866 --> 00:37.096
None of them are you.

00:37.135 --> 00:40.627
- Start teaching me.
- I can't. I have plans with Amanda.

00:40.672 --> 00:42.105
Oh, Amanda. She's home?

00:42.140 --> 00:45.166
You have no idea
how disappointed I am right now.

00:45.210 --> 00:47.735
- Mom...
- Flight leaves in less than two hours.

00:47.779 --> 00:50.077
Thank you for letting me know
Amanda was here.

00:50.115 --> 00:51.241
Glad I could help.

00:51.283 --> 00:53.615
We made it clear
you're not to see Amanda.

00:53.652 --> 00:55.119
- You're grounded.
- Two weeks.

01:01.694 --> 01:04.992
Latnok?

01:07.600 --> 01:10.501
- Amanda.
- I didn't get on the plane.

01:18.177 --> 01:20.702
Tell me what happened.

01:20.746 --> 01:24.307
I was waiting at the gate. It was time
to board, and I could not move.

01:24.350 --> 01:28.514
It was like my whole body was saying,
"You can't do this. This is wrong."

01:28.554 --> 01:31.148
I'm running through the terminal,
jumping in a cab

01:31.190 --> 01:33.989
and knocking on your window.
Total loss of sanity.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.994
My mom's gonna kill me.

01:39.032 --> 01:41.899
Maybe your mom will understand
when you explain it to her.

01:41.935 --> 01:46.031
Key word: "understand." She's not
capable of. What am I gonna do?

01:46.073 --> 01:50.635
- I'll go get Stephen and Nicole.
- No. You can't involve them.

01:50.744 --> 01:53.838
I'm sorry I've already involved you.

01:53.880 --> 01:57.043
Amanda, everything's gonna be OK.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:06.827 --> 02:08.089
Can I stay here?

02:08.996 --> 02:11.727
- Amanda...
- Till morning. Then I'll go home.

02:11.766 --> 02:15.293
- I'm already grounded.
- No one will even know I was here.

02:15.370 --> 02:18.168
I just need some time
to get my head together.

02:18.206 --> 02:21.039
My mom won't be as scary
to deal with in the daylight.

02:26.381 --> 02:27.439
All yours.

02:30.051 --> 02:31.450
Thank you so much.

02:31.486 --> 02:35.855
My luggage is probably being searched
by the terrorist watch squad.

02:35.890 --> 02:37.653
Can I borrow something to sleep in?

02:38.826 --> 02:40.350
Sure.

02:40.395 --> 02:42.761
You're being really amazing
about all of this.

02:42.797 --> 02:46.392
I knew you were the kind of guy who'd
give the shirt off their back to help,

02:46.434 --> 02:48.733
but this is above and beyond.

02:50.973 --> 02:52.668
I didn't...

02:54.076 --> 02:55.737
I'm...

02:55.778 --> 02:58.542
I didn't... I just... I meant...

03:10.492 --> 03:13.723
- Thank you.
- What's the matter?

03:13.762 --> 03:17.528
- What do you mean?
- Your cheeks are getting pinker.

03:19.068 --> 03:20.797
Are they?

03:20.836 --> 03:22.827
And your body temperature is climbing.

03:29.579 --> 03:31.444
I'll get you a thinner blanket.

04:05.816 --> 04:09.843
- Let me sleep on the floor.
- You don't like the tub?

04:09.887 --> 04:12.981
No. I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to be polite.

04:13.023 --> 04:17.357
- How is sleeping on the floor polite?
- I don't want to take your tub.

04:17.394 --> 04:19.827
I want you to have it.
Unless you don't like it.

04:19.863 --> 04:21.228
Why wouldn't I like it?

04:21.265 --> 04:23.961
- It's a tub.
- It's your tub, all of it.

04:44.890 --> 04:48.656
Can you lock the door? I don't
want anyone to catch me in here.

05:15.254 --> 05:16.721
Asleep yet?

05:18.491 --> 05:21.927
No. How's the tub?
Are you comfortable?

05:23.129 --> 05:27.498
Strangely, I am.
How's the floor?

05:27.533 --> 05:30.764
It's too open. No sides.

05:37.977 --> 05:42.710
You could, if you wanted to...
I mean, there's plenty of room.

05:45.651 --> 05:46.948
With you?

05:48.321 --> 05:49.379
With me.

06:16.717 --> 06:19.845
- That better?
- Much.

06:22.189 --> 06:23.656
Thank you for this.

06:25.525 --> 06:26.685
You're welcome.

06:32.967 --> 06:35.333
<i>I knew allowing Amanda
to spend the night</i>

06:35.370 --> 06:39.204
<i>could get me in more trouble.
But how could I turn her away?</i>

06:39.307 --> 06:42.970
<i>And how could doing
something so wrong feel so right?</i>

06:51.519 --> 06:55.046
Kyle? Is everything all right?

06:55.089 --> 06:56.989
Everything's fine.

06:57.058 --> 06:59.026
- Your door's locked.
- Is it?

07:00.895 --> 07:04.923
- What happened?
- Nothing. I...

07:04.967 --> 07:06.798
I just woke up.

07:09.171 --> 07:11.935
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:13.375 --> 07:16.503
- Come grab some breakfast.
- OK.

07:37.900 --> 07:41.234
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yeah. Where did you get that?

07:41.271 --> 07:44.604
- That was with my personal things.
- No, I found it on my bed.

07:44.641 --> 07:48.099
You know, Jessi, all you had to do
was ask for the record,

07:48.144 --> 07:52.581
and I would have given it to you.
Why would you break into my cabinet?

07:52.615 --> 07:55.880
- What cabinet?
- Don't lie to me. All right?

07:55.919 --> 07:58.217
There has to be trust
if this is gonna work,

07:58.254 --> 08:01.189
and you snooping around in my stuff
is just not gonna cut it.

08:01.224 --> 08:04.193
I'm telling you the truth.
I found the record right here.

08:06.629 --> 08:08.927
That song meant something
to my mother.

08:10.800 --> 08:13.564
I was hoping you'd
tell me more about her.

08:13.603 --> 08:17.802
- Now is not the time.
- No, don't take that from me.

08:18.809 --> 08:21.300
All right. Just be careful with it.

09:01.253 --> 09:03.983
Kyle mistook getting grounded
for being in prison.

09:04.055 --> 09:07.547
- There's a difference?
- He locked his door this morning.

09:07.626 --> 09:10.527
- I wouldn't worry about it.
- He's never locked it before.

09:10.562 --> 09:13.998
Maybe he just wants some privacy.

09:14.032 --> 09:16.728
- Privacy?
- I don't get it.

09:18.804 --> 09:21.398
- Oh, I get it.
- People, it's breakfast.

09:22.774 --> 09:25.800
- Good morning.
- Just in time to have breakfast.

09:25.844 --> 09:29.109
- Maybe you can beat the batter.
- Are we having pancakes?

09:29.181 --> 09:31.377
Or perhaps you'd like
to grill your sausage.

09:31.417 --> 09:32.907
- Josh...
- I might vomit.

09:32.985 --> 09:35.215
- Kyle, ignore him.
- Why?

09:35.288 --> 09:37.119
Not even worth explaining.

09:37.190 --> 09:40.091
Now that we're all together
enjoying our quality time...

09:40.159 --> 09:42.684
- Mandated time.
- You're gonna make good use of it.

09:42.728 --> 09:45.060
- Meaning?
- Gutters. Clean 'em out.

09:45.131 --> 09:46.962
You and I will wash
all the windows.

09:46.999 --> 09:49.559
That's cruel
and unusual punishment.

09:49.602 --> 09:52.503
We cooked up a little
to-do list for you guys, too.

09:52.538 --> 09:56.065
Bring it on.
I'll to-do the hell out of it

09:56.108 --> 09:59.600
in exchange for the briefest
of parole periods later this evening.

09:59.679 --> 10:02.375
Your sentence does not
include a parole option.

10:02.415 --> 10:06.715
I'm trying to be responsible.
I'm the sober cab to Preston's party.

10:06.786 --> 10:09.449
- Sober cab?
- Designated non-drinking driver,

10:09.523 --> 10:11.855
and if I bail,
I'll ruin it for everyone else.

10:11.892 --> 10:14.122
Everyone else should
not be drinking at all.

10:14.194 --> 10:15.957
Absurd request denied.

10:15.996 --> 10:19.830
As long as the parole board's in
session, I need to see Andy today.

10:20.868 --> 10:26.602
- Emotional support. She's got chemo.
- Andy has chemo on Tuesdays.

10:26.640 --> 10:29.541
I can't believe you just falsely
played the cancer card.

10:29.576 --> 10:33.979
- It was her idea.
- You want to make a plea, too?

10:34.047 --> 10:38.746
- No. I'll do my time.
- Man of honor.

10:38.785 --> 10:42.983
- Or a giant suck-up.
- You can start by cleaning your room.

10:44.993 --> 10:46.290
I'll get started.

10:48.663 --> 10:50.426
Think he's gonna peel his banana?

11:04.546 --> 11:06.707
This is so sweet,
but I'm too nervous to eat.

11:06.781 --> 11:09.750
You're underestimating your mother.
She might surprise you.

11:09.784 --> 11:13.117
I appreciate the optimism,
but I expect bloodcurdling screams

11:13.154 --> 11:14.587
followed by frothing.

11:15.623 --> 11:18.820
- Well, I'm here if you need me.
- I'm counting on it.

11:21.462 --> 11:22.691
Here goes.

11:29.238 --> 11:31.570
- Hi.
- Hi. Keep your window closed,

11:31.607 --> 11:33.871
unless you want Josh
to spray your whole room.

11:37.680 --> 11:40.672
- How long do you think that'll take?
- In Josh time, all day.

11:40.749 --> 11:42.512
Thanks.

11:45.487 --> 11:46.852
Amanda, we have a problem.

11:48.223 --> 11:51.158
No. None of the other windows open.

11:51.193 --> 11:53.423
Great.

11:53.462 --> 11:54.952
So, what do we do?

12:15.318 --> 12:17.582
- Amanda?
- What about her?

12:17.654 --> 12:20.020
I was just wondering how
she's doing in New York.

12:20.056 --> 12:23.184
My guess is she'll be thrilled
to get a break from her mother.

12:30.300 --> 12:33.360
No. The front door.

12:33.470 --> 12:37.840
Amanda Bloom, you little stowaway.

12:37.875 --> 12:38.933
Lori?

12:42.580 --> 12:45.743
Here you go. I left the pieces
out in the dining room.

12:45.816 --> 12:49.047
- Armed and ready to polish.
- Make me proud.

12:49.086 --> 12:52.078
- Kyle, I need you at the computer.
- OK.

13:00.865 --> 13:04.824
Whenever I save something, the hard
drive makes this grinding sound, like...

13:04.869 --> 13:08.396
I'll take a look at it.

13:17.049 --> 13:18.880
- Mrs. Trager.
- Yes.

13:18.950 --> 13:22.181
I'm Constance Berlinger,
Department of Children Services?

13:22.220 --> 13:25.781
- How can I help you?
- We've received a complaint.

13:25.857 --> 13:28.849
Kyle? Who filed a complaint?

13:28.894 --> 13:30.657
You know I can't tell you that.

13:30.729 --> 13:34.187
Never mind. I can guess.

13:38.236 --> 13:41.296
- Carol Bloom?
- Unbelievable.

13:41.373 --> 13:44.501
She's angry because she thinks
Kyle interfered with Amanda.

13:44.576 --> 13:47.374
- She called Social Services.
- He's not in the system.

13:47.412 --> 13:50.348
He was. If someone files a complaint
about a former ward,

13:50.383 --> 13:53.716
- they're legally bound to check it out.
- What was her complaint?

13:53.786 --> 13:57.984
Kyle's living here without proper
supervision and being disruptive.

13:58.024 --> 14:00.356
- That's not true.
- Well, of course it isn't.

14:00.393 --> 14:03.089
- But now we need to prove it.
- To that woman?

14:03.129 --> 14:06.496
- She doesn't even know us.
- This is how the system works.

14:06.532 --> 14:09.330
We have to get through.
Let her go through her checklist.

14:09.368 --> 14:12.895
- What kind of checklist?
- Questions to make sure we're providing

14:12.939 --> 14:14.873
a safe and healthy environment.

14:14.941 --> 14:18.570
The first question: does the child
have his own proper bed?

14:18.611 --> 14:20.340
- Great.
- The bigger problem is

14:20.413 --> 14:23.780
- keeping the truth about you a secret.
- I'll be careful.

14:23.816 --> 14:27.218
None of us can slip.
I know her type. Very thorough.

14:27.254 --> 14:31.247
We just have to keep our stories
straight and stay on our toes.

14:33.227 --> 14:34.285
Be careful.

14:35.295 --> 14:37.763
This woman can't find out
who you are.

14:43.070 --> 14:46.665
Just so I'm up to speed. You were
first called in to treat Noah...

14:46.707 --> 14:49.870
- Kyle.
- I'm a little confused.

14:49.910 --> 14:51.707
We changed his name.

14:52.579 --> 14:56.606
- Legally, at his request.
- I'd like to see those papers.

14:56.717 --> 14:59.277
No problem.
They're in the family file in my office.

14:59.319 --> 15:00.377
Could you grab them?

15:00.420 --> 15:03.049
Absolutely. Could I get you
something to drink?

15:03.091 --> 15:04.490
Ice water, please.

15:08.930 --> 15:12.798
So, you first met Kyle
at the detention center,

15:12.867 --> 15:14.732
diagnosed him with amnesia,

15:14.803 --> 15:17.397
and the very next day,
moved him, your new patient,

15:17.472 --> 15:18.871
in here with your family.

15:18.940 --> 15:22.205
There were special circumstances.

15:22.243 --> 15:24.837
Of course there were.

15:34.589 --> 15:37.717
I hate that some stranger can come
and decide things about us.

15:37.759 --> 15:39.421
I know. As if we're the kind of kids

15:39.495 --> 15:42.521
who'd smuggle in one of their
runaway girlfriends.

15:46.468 --> 15:47.765
Amanda needed help.

15:47.803 --> 15:50.363
You're not getting away
with the nutshell version.

15:50.472 --> 15:53.873
- What happened with you two?
- I heard a knock on my window,

15:53.909 --> 15:56.343
went over, Amanda was there,
and she needed...

15:56.378 --> 15:58.710
No, no.
Never mind. I know nothing happened.

15:58.747 --> 16:02.774
- It's you and Amanda, for God sakes.
- Still, where'd she sleep?

16:03.352 --> 16:05.820
- My tub.
- Where did you sleep?

16:07.489 --> 16:11.550
- My tub.
- You dog! And?

16:14.063 --> 16:17.556
OK, the real scandal is did she
just bail on her flight and come here?

16:17.601 --> 16:18.659
Yes.

16:18.735 --> 16:21.602
And her mother, the crypt keeper,
doesn't know.

16:21.671 --> 16:24.970
Well, she must know by now,
assuming Amanda left and went home.

16:25.041 --> 16:28.636
She better have. You don't want
to get busted harboring a fugitive

16:28.678 --> 16:30.202
with that social worker here.

16:35.085 --> 16:36.518
Shaken, not stirred.

16:37.954 --> 16:39.148
Thank you.

16:45.962 --> 16:49.728
Following the death of his parents,
you've become his permanent guardians.

16:49.799 --> 16:52.063
Yes. We love Kyle.

16:52.135 --> 16:56.869
Honestly, the idea of him being
disruptive in any way is ludicrous.

16:56.941 --> 16:58.533
Our son Josh on the other hand...

16:58.609 --> 17:00.201
Problem with Josh's behavior?

17:00.278 --> 17:03.247
Is there a problem
with Josh's behavior?

17:05.483 --> 17:08.349
- There's no problem.
- I have to hide all my porn.

17:08.386 --> 17:09.944
She's gonna search the house?

17:09.987 --> 17:13.252
Oh, yeah. "Social worker"
is basically a fancy title for "snoop."

17:13.324 --> 17:15.917
- Looking for?
- Weapons of mass destruction.

17:17.994 --> 17:19.963
Guns, sex toys, drugs, booze.

17:20.064 --> 17:21.929
- Oh, no!
- Relax.

17:21.965 --> 17:25.128
- Dad flushed his pot stash.
- I'm not worried about Dad.

17:25.169 --> 17:29.299
- You running a pot stash now?
- No. I have this.

17:33.578 --> 17:34.636
Beer?

17:34.746 --> 17:37.738
I was holding it for Preston
until his parents left town.

17:39.451 --> 17:41.646
I'm the only one he could trust with it.

17:43.655 --> 17:46.783
Because I'm the most responsible.
I hate myself!

17:46.825 --> 17:49.385
- We have to get rid of it.
- First, you. Out.

17:49.428 --> 17:51.623
Smuggling beer is not
gonna score points.

17:51.697 --> 17:53.824
I'm the one that got you
into this mess.

17:53.865 --> 17:57.062
Two little words called "peer pressure"
got me into this mess.

17:57.135 --> 18:00.764
Figure out why you have a bathtub
in your room instead of a bed.

18:02.441 --> 18:05.774
And you, tap into that
cunning little brain of yours

18:05.811 --> 18:07.575
and come up with something quick.

18:14.954 --> 18:18.014
Tell me about his relationships
outside the family.

18:18.057 --> 18:20.116
I assume you're referring to Amanda.

18:20.193 --> 18:22.787
It's a very caring,
supportive relationship.

18:22.829 --> 18:26.890
- There's nothing objectionable.
- Amanda's mother is overreacting.

18:26.966 --> 18:29.560
She's a little high-strung.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.637
Amanda. I thought you made it home.

18:35.675 --> 18:38.644
I'm trapped. Social worker's
staked out your living room.

18:39.846 --> 18:42.542
I bet my mother's responsible.
It's so mortifying.

18:42.582 --> 18:45.416
- Maybe we should tell her.
- That I never got on my plane

18:45.452 --> 18:49.047
and hid out here in your bedroom?
That would prove her the complaints.

18:49.089 --> 18:51.387
- So, what do we do?
- Sneak me out.

18:51.425 --> 18:53.393
I'll wait till she leaves and head home.

18:53.427 --> 18:54.860
Why wait?

18:54.895 --> 18:58.888
Do you want that social worker around
when my mom's head explodes?

19:00.834 --> 19:02.131
I'll move the ladder.

19:06.673 --> 19:08.197
- Hey.
- Hi.

19:08.308 --> 19:11.766
I know you're nervous, but when
you talk to her, just be yourself.

19:11.845 --> 19:15.804
- I'm sorry to put you through this.
- It's not your fault.

19:15.849 --> 19:19.080
Carol's trying to pin the problems
she having with Amanda on you.

19:19.119 --> 19:20.951
I'll show off some of your drawings.

19:20.989 --> 19:24.254
- Can I go grab a few?
- I... don't want to show them.

19:24.292 --> 19:27.455
- They're beautiful.
- They're too personal.

19:27.495 --> 19:29.258
Oh. Well, of course.

19:29.297 --> 19:31.959
Take them off your wall
before she inspects your room.

19:32.033 --> 19:33.762
When's that happening?

19:33.802 --> 19:37.761
I'd like to delay explaining your tub,
at least until you've won her over.

19:37.806 --> 19:39.296
- Right.
- Make your room ready

19:39.374 --> 19:41.467
in case she insists on starting there.

19:41.509 --> 19:45.036
So get back in there and clear out
anything incriminating.

19:45.080 --> 19:46.707
OK. I'll try.

19:57.259 --> 19:59.819
- What are you doing?
- What are you?

20:01.163 --> 20:03.063
Amanda, we need...

20:11.073 --> 20:13.667
- What are you doing here?
- That's what I want to know.

20:13.742 --> 20:16.210
When she left,
we could spend more time together.

20:16.278 --> 20:18.746
- You did?
- Well, I...

20:18.781 --> 20:21.045
She's climbing
through your bedroom window?

20:21.117 --> 20:24.348
- I asked you not to do that.
- I had to see you right away.

20:24.420 --> 20:25.512
Why?

20:25.554 --> 20:27.351
- None of your business.
- Excuse me?

20:27.423 --> 20:30.256
- Why aren't you in New York?
- None of your business!

20:30.326 --> 20:33.318
Both of you, please!
I'm already grounded!

20:33.362 --> 20:35.797
There a social worker
investigating my family,

20:35.832 --> 20:39.893
I can't let her find girls who aren't
supposed to be here fighting in my room!

20:41.738 --> 20:43.137
You both have to go.

20:44.040 --> 20:45.234
Now.

20:46.076 --> 20:47.270
Declan?

20:53.783 --> 20:56.877
- How come I got stuck doing this part?
- You hid it, you lift it.

20:58.421 --> 21:03.358
- That ladder weighs a ton.
- Thank God the cavalry's here.

21:03.393 --> 21:05.486
Is your leg OK?

21:05.595 --> 21:07.756
Wobbly,
but there's beer to be liberated

21:07.797 --> 21:09.492
and damsels to be rescued, so...

21:12.703 --> 21:16.400
I must say I'm impressed. You know,
you coming here helping Lori out,

21:16.474 --> 21:19.500
even though she's still
closed for business.

21:19.544 --> 21:20.943
Jerk!

21:21.012 --> 21:24.175
Oh, smart! Leave a bruise
with a social worker present.

21:24.282 --> 21:27.615
- Josh? I need you.
- Go, go, go!

21:29.420 --> 21:33.186
Our room's up here with Josh and Lori's.
Kyle's got the spare one downstairs.

21:33.291 --> 21:36.886
I'll show you around after you've
had a chance to talk to everybody.

21:36.928 --> 21:39.590
Hello, Mother. What can I do for you?

21:39.630 --> 21:42.428
This is Mrs. Berlinger.
She'd like to see your room.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.968
But of course. It's this one right here.

21:45.036 --> 21:48.632
- The one that says "Josh" on the door?
- Exactly.

22:01.386 --> 22:05.117
- Looking for an escape route?
- I just need to get some fresh air.

22:05.190 --> 22:08.591
Yeah. I don't blame you. Hopefully,
she'll be quick and painless.

22:08.627 --> 22:12.188
If she asks you about Amanda, say you
hope she's having a great time.

22:12.231 --> 22:16.065
But knowing how her mother feels, you
recognize the appropriate boundaries.

22:17.035 --> 22:18.195
Boundaries.

22:19.204 --> 22:20.262
Right.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.004
- Will you excuse me?
- Sure.

22:26.045 --> 22:27.603
This is Lori's room.

22:27.647 --> 22:29.547
- They're coming.
- Lori?

22:33.586 --> 22:35.451
- Hi!
- Hi.

22:36.456 --> 22:38.890
Constance Berlinger,
my daughter Lori.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.255
Hello.

22:42.629 --> 22:46.793
And welcome to my den of teen angst.

22:48.034 --> 22:51.231
Which I must confess,
I retreat to way too often.

22:51.304 --> 22:54.967
Not Kyle, though. Not Mr. Positive Spin.

22:55.008 --> 22:56.805
You should let some light in here.

23:07.988 --> 23:12.186
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

23:12.259 --> 23:16.491
- I need to move the ladder.
- That's gonna be difficult right now.

23:27.941 --> 23:31.342
Can you not touch that? I don't think
Kyle would want you to handle it.

23:31.412 --> 23:33.505
How would you know?

23:33.547 --> 23:35.640
I know that box is
very important to him.

23:37.584 --> 23:41.282
Do you know why it's important to him?
Because I do.

23:41.323 --> 23:43.257
Oh, really? Why?

23:44.726 --> 23:47.820
I can't share that information
with you, and neither can Kyle.

23:49.964 --> 23:53.695
You have no idea about what
Kyle and I share with each other.

23:55.303 --> 23:57.567
I know you don't know him
as well as you think.

24:00.241 --> 24:01.833
You can't go through the window.

24:01.876 --> 24:05.243
She's about to start my interview
with a clear view of the front door.

24:05.280 --> 24:08.647
- So I'm still stuck?
- Not necessarily.

24:08.750 --> 24:10.274
I'll get Jessi out first.

24:10.318 --> 24:12.582
If I can't get back,
look for my signal, then go.

24:12.620 --> 24:15.784
- What kind of signal?
- I'm not sure yet. You'll just know.

24:15.858 --> 24:17.291
Come with me.

24:31.207 --> 24:32.868
Finally, we can talk.

24:32.908 --> 24:35.103
- Later.
- No.

24:35.177 --> 24:36.508
This is important.

24:44.920 --> 24:45.978
Here.

24:47.523 --> 24:51.392
It's their song. D4.
It's the missing record.

24:51.428 --> 24:53.953
- Where did you get this?
- I found it in my room.

24:54.030 --> 24:57.989
Brian said he didn't leave it there for
me, but I don't know who else would.

24:58.068 --> 25:01.435
- You have to play it.
- I will, but I can't right now.

25:01.471 --> 25:03.598
But It's part of our history.

25:04.775 --> 25:07.209
I know, but I need to
focus on my family right now.

25:09.446 --> 25:12.176
Brian said that you'd be like this.

25:12.249 --> 25:14.149
He said I couldn't count on you.

25:14.217 --> 25:18.654
- Why would he say that?
- You keep sending me away.

25:18.688 --> 25:20.656
Jessi, you know the situation today.

25:20.724 --> 25:22.885
So, what if some social worker
sees me here?

25:22.926 --> 25:25.053
She can't see anything
out of the ordinary.

25:25.128 --> 25:27.460
We are out of the ordinary.

25:27.497 --> 25:31.400
Don't forget, I'm more like you
than any of these people here,

25:31.436 --> 25:33.199
more than the Tragers and Amanda.

25:33.271 --> 25:35.501
Why do you have to
make this a competition?

25:35.573 --> 25:38.474
There should be no competition.

25:38.543 --> 25:40.238
Jessi! Jessi!

25:40.278 --> 25:41.973
- I'll leave when I want.
- Jessi.

25:43.214 --> 25:46.206
- I didn't know you were here.
- She was just leaving.

25:47.485 --> 25:50.477
- Hello.
- Hi, there. And you are?

25:50.555 --> 25:53.183
- Jessi.
- A friend of Kyle's?

25:53.257 --> 25:55.987
Well, I'd like to think
I'm more than that.

25:59.597 --> 26:01.622
Well, I started off as Nicole's patient,

26:01.666 --> 26:04.863
but now it's like
I'm part of the family.

26:06.171 --> 26:07.297
How lovely.

26:09.475 --> 26:10.942
Well, bye.

26:51.751 --> 26:55.847
- How long was Jessi your patient?
- For a few months.

26:55.889 --> 26:57.356
You treated her here?

26:57.423 --> 26:59.857
Yes, but I don't see patients
at home anymore.

26:59.926 --> 27:02.520
Because they kept becoming
part of the family?

27:03.730 --> 27:05.823
What'd she say?

27:05.865 --> 27:09.824
"Mrs. Trager, you seem to have a history
of getting too involved emotionally."

27:10.336 --> 27:12.327
At least Nicole has emotions.

27:13.373 --> 27:16.467
You realize that eavesdropping
is an invasion of privacy

27:16.543 --> 27:19.240
and me asking you to do it
is unacceptable parenting.

27:19.313 --> 27:22.407
- Right.
- Good. What'd she say now?

27:22.449 --> 27:25.816
Twenty-four cases,
20 ladder rungs each way.

27:25.853 --> 27:27.480
Just a few weeks' post-op.

27:27.521 --> 27:29.785
You know I'll owe you for,
like, ever, right?

27:29.857 --> 27:33.588
I'm already making a list
of the ways you can make it up to me.

27:33.627 --> 27:36.061
No way. We made a deal.

27:36.096 --> 27:39.065
I think we should
amend our deal to include

27:39.099 --> 27:41.158
one-time payments for heroic measures.

27:41.268 --> 27:43.566
You want me to lose
my born-again virgin status

27:43.604 --> 27:47.267
because you moved beer so you can
bring it to a party I can't even go to?

27:47.341 --> 27:49.741
Pretty much.

27:49.777 --> 27:52.337
You're technically doing it
to help Kyle anyway,

27:52.413 --> 27:55.679
which you always do
for no return favors.

27:55.717 --> 27:58.151
And now that I think about it,
I'm mad at you

27:58.186 --> 28:01.519
because you never ask him for anything,
and yet I get propositioned

28:01.556 --> 28:06.687
- for casual, meaningless sex?
- Meaningless sex? Really?

28:07.796 --> 28:09.661
Not meaning...
You know what I mean.

28:09.698 --> 28:14.761
- No. No, I'm not so sure that I do.
- Don't get mad.

28:17.339 --> 28:18.897
I'm being a jerk, huh?

28:18.940 --> 28:21.306
Tell the boy something
he doesn't already know.

28:21.376 --> 28:23.310
Not a good time, Josh.

28:23.345 --> 28:27.042
I enjoy the "are they or aren't they"
drama as much as the next person,

28:27.082 --> 28:29.676
but you two seem to have
gotten a little sidetracked.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.412
Yeah, I'm on it.

28:31.453 --> 28:34.651
Figure out how to explain
why Kyle sleeps in the bathtub.

28:34.690 --> 28:38.319
Well, he's got a cover story for that.
The one his fake parents used.

28:38.361 --> 28:40.556
That's a lie.
You know how Kyle is with lying.

28:40.630 --> 28:42.063
Meanwhile, he's had Amanda

28:42.131 --> 28:45.191
secretly hidden in his room
for the last 12 hours.

28:45.267 --> 28:49.795
If Kyle the rebel makes an appearance,
pretend you're the social worker.

28:49.872 --> 28:52.306
Does any cover explain
why responsible parents

28:52.375 --> 28:55.071
allow their child to sleep
in a bathroom appliance?

28:58.514 --> 29:01.881
Kyle, Mrs. Berlinger wants
to speak to you now.

29:10.027 --> 29:13.326
Just another day in the Trager house.

29:13.363 --> 29:16.298
Well, maybe that's why she's here.
No, seriously.

29:16.333 --> 29:19.530
With everything that's happened
since Kyle came into our lives,

29:19.569 --> 29:23.733
what seems everyday to us may be
just plain weird to everybody else.

29:23.774 --> 29:27.301
Yeah, maybe you're right.
How many kids help take down

29:27.344 --> 29:29.778
a multi-national corporation
over the weekend?

29:29.813 --> 29:33.374
So, Kyle, how would you describe
your time with the Tragers?

29:33.417 --> 29:36.215
They've been wonderful to me.

29:36.286 --> 29:39.346
I had no one when they took me in,
and they became my family.

29:39.423 --> 29:44.053
But you found your family. You were
reunited with your real parents.

29:45.595 --> 29:49.362
Leaving the Tragers
was extremely difficult.

29:49.400 --> 29:51.925
When I was gone, I missed them terribly.

29:54.005 --> 29:59.443
And what was it like coming back here
after your parents died?

29:59.510 --> 30:02.502
<i>She was trained to pickup
on non-verbal cues.</i>

30:02.547 --> 30:07.382
<i>A twitch, a tense grip of my hands,
a nervous gesture,</i>

30:07.418 --> 30:10.148
<i>anything that could indicate
I wasn't being truthful.</i>

30:10.254 --> 30:12.154
Kyle?

30:12.190 --> 30:14.886
Even though the circumstances
were tragic,

30:14.926 --> 30:18.362
I knew I'd be in a home where I felt
loved and well taken care of.

30:22.233 --> 30:25.226
I'd like to know more about
your relationship with Nicole.

30:26.371 --> 30:29.033
<i>This was
Amanda's chance to escape,</i>

30:29.074 --> 30:33.170
<i>but there was no way she could know it.
I had to signal her. But how?</i>

30:33.212 --> 30:36.409
When did it become more
maternal than professional?

30:36.482 --> 30:38.211
<i>If I relaxed and concentrated,</i>

30:38.250 --> 30:41.242
<i>I could control the flow of electrons
through the house.</i>

30:45.491 --> 30:48.221
Nicole and I had a special bond
from the beginning.

30:48.260 --> 30:50.626
I felt a special connection
with everyone here.

30:50.662 --> 30:52.562
They taught me something important.

30:53.999 --> 30:56.729
<i>All the abilities
I'd explored seemed useless</i>

30:56.769 --> 30:59.169
<i>if I couldn't help Amanda
sneak out of the house.</i>

30:59.204 --> 31:02.732
<i>I had to focus,
just not look like I was focusing.</i>

31:05.979 --> 31:09.073
They've all welcomed me
as one of their own.

31:09.115 --> 31:11.606
My life has changed for the better
by living here.

31:13.052 --> 31:15.452
What kinds of things
have they taught you?

31:16.656 --> 31:19.716
I think the most important thing
is what it means to be a family.

31:20.827 --> 31:24.661
- Am I passing your test?
- This isn't a test.

31:24.731 --> 31:26.494
It merely helps me evaluate...

31:26.533 --> 31:29.832
Whether or not this is
a loving and nurturing environment.

31:29.869 --> 31:32.303
- Something like that.
- I don't understand.

31:32.338 --> 31:34.966
How can you quantify
a family's love for one another?

31:35.008 --> 31:37.603
Can you measure intangible
things like nurturing?

31:37.645 --> 31:43.208
It's just a tool that Social Services
uses. A standard checklist.

31:43.250 --> 31:46.981
<i>I need to get Amanda
past the kitchen and out of the house.</i>

31:47.021 --> 31:49.717
If it's a checklist you need,

31:49.757 --> 31:51.019
let me give you mine.

31:51.058 --> 31:55.586
They gave me a seat at their dinner
table when I had nowhere else to go.

31:55.629 --> 31:59.963
Stephen gave up his work room
so I could have my own place to sleep.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.332
Josh taught me how to play basketball.

32:02.369 --> 32:04.735
And Lori shared her birthday with me.

32:04.805 --> 32:09.435
And Nicole always made me
feel safe and protected,

32:09.476 --> 32:11.239
even when I felt lost and scared.

32:11.312 --> 32:16.012
I could go on and on because
this family means everything to me.

32:16.051 --> 32:17.416
Interesting.

32:28.530 --> 32:30.657
Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.

32:34.970 --> 32:36.562
- Amanda?
- Mom?

32:47.282 --> 32:50.912
Someone from the airline called,
telling me you never got on the plane.

32:50.987 --> 32:53.285
- I...
- You deliberately defied me, Amanda.

32:53.322 --> 32:57.088
- I didn't plan any of this!
- This deceitful, impetuous behavior.

32:57.159 --> 32:59.024
You never would have done it.

32:59.061 --> 33:01.928
I know you're upset,
but it's really unfair to blame Kyle.

33:01.964 --> 33:06.298
He has filled her head with God knows
what nonsense. Now she is lying to me,

33:06.335 --> 33:09.031
and throwing away
everything she has worked for.

33:09.071 --> 33:11.232
My choice.
It has nothing to do with Kyle.

33:11.307 --> 33:13.775
But you came here
and ran to him, didn't you?

33:13.843 --> 33:16.676
- Yes, but...
- And you let her in, did you not?

33:16.779 --> 33:20.146
- Yes, but it was late, and I...
- My daughter spent the night here,

33:20.182 --> 33:22.343
and you knew nothing about it, did you?

33:22.451 --> 33:25.443
It's that kind of loose,
permissive attitude...

33:25.488 --> 33:29.186
Mom, stop!
The Tragers are an amazing family,

33:29.226 --> 33:33.925
and Kyle is the most incredible person.
The real problem is you have no idea

33:33.997 --> 33:36.591
and no interest in who I am
or what I want.

33:36.667 --> 33:39.067
Ask yourself why I was
so afraid to talk to you

33:39.102 --> 33:41.536
that I hid here all night
instead of coming home.

33:41.571 --> 33:44.631
If you wanted to report
a really messed-up family,

33:44.708 --> 33:47.108
- report our own.
- What are you talking about?

33:47.177 --> 33:49.771
Everyone knows you called
Social Services here.

33:49.813 --> 33:52.043
I did nothing of the sort.

33:56.887 --> 34:02.223
I'm sorry, Mrs. Trager. I didn't
mean to cause you so much trouble.

34:05.430 --> 34:06.761
I'm sorry.

34:15.540 --> 34:19.340
Well. Clearly, that's
a private family matter,

34:19.409 --> 34:22.469
not one Social Services could resolve.

34:22.513 --> 34:24.481
- Then we're done.
- For now.

34:24.549 --> 34:27.712
- I still need to file my report.
- Anything else I can tell you?

34:27.752 --> 34:31.518
No. No, I'll just... Oh, wait.
There is something I've overlooked.

34:31.556 --> 34:32.648
Kyle's room.

34:32.724 --> 34:36.125
- What about it?
- I need to see it.

34:39.597 --> 34:42.692
- Is there a problem?
- No. Not at all.

34:44.136 --> 34:45.194
It's this way.

34:47.438 --> 34:51.205
We've always believed in making Kyle
feel as comfortable as possible.

34:51.243 --> 34:53.335
We encouraged him
to make his room his own,

34:53.379 --> 34:56.177
which includes some
unorthodox choices.

34:56.248 --> 35:00.014
I've see hundreds of teenagers' rooms
with the most eccentric designs.

35:00.052 --> 35:02.384
- Nothing can throw me.
- Well, always a first.

35:02.421 --> 35:03.513
This is it.

35:25.412 --> 35:27.607
Well, this all seems quite ordinary.

35:29.049 --> 35:33.042
- If you ask me, perfectly normal.
- Thank you.

35:33.119 --> 35:36.850
You'll receive notice of my evaluation
within 48 hours.

35:36.923 --> 35:39.949
I don't suppose you could
give me a little preview.

35:42.062 --> 35:43.996
It's not easy when someone drops in

35:44.030 --> 35:46.055
and puts your family
under a microscope.

35:46.132 --> 35:49.966
But yours survived. And Kyle
seems like a promising young man.

35:50.003 --> 35:52.164
I don't see any reason
to be concerned.

35:52.272 --> 35:53.534
Thank you.

35:53.573 --> 35:56.737
I do, however, have some
gave concerns about you.

35:56.811 --> 35:58.506
You've crossed boundaries,

35:58.546 --> 36:00.878
mixing your personal
and professional life,

36:00.915 --> 36:03.907
shows an alarming lack of judgment
and ethical integrity.

36:03.984 --> 36:07.215
It would be remiss of me
if I didn't file the proper notice.

36:10.024 --> 36:13.357
- I'm shocked that you feel that way.
- Really?

36:13.394 --> 36:16.557
Knowing what I've heard about you,
it doesn't surprise me at all.

36:23.404 --> 36:28.398
- How'd you get a bed in here?
- I just found it this way.

36:36.051 --> 36:39.384
- Beer?
- Soft, firm and extra firm.

36:39.488 --> 36:42.855
- Where did it come from?
- Does it matter? We saved the day.

36:42.891 --> 36:45.121
You have how many
cases of beer in this house?

36:45.193 --> 36:48.253
Not to drink. I was storing it
for some friends.

36:48.296 --> 36:50.457
I know that's
the most idiotic move ever.

36:50.532 --> 36:54.059
- Do what you need to do.
- You're staying grounded.

36:54.169 --> 36:58.538
I know it got you into trouble,
but thank you for doing this.

36:59.708 --> 37:02.370
All of you. Thank you for today.

37:03.078 --> 37:06.514
We should celebrate.
Let's crack open a few, make a toast.

37:06.548 --> 37:09.074
Say goodbye to this beer.
Come on, everybody out.

37:22.398 --> 37:25.390
Come in.

37:30.840 --> 37:34.298
- You've been in here all day.
- A lot to catch up on.

37:43.553 --> 37:46.114
I don't want to disturb you.
I... I just want to say

37:46.156 --> 37:49.182
letting Amanda stay here
without telling you was wrong,

37:49.226 --> 37:51.057
and I'm sorry.

37:52.162 --> 37:54.926
- It's funny.
- What?

37:54.998 --> 37:57.865
How, even with the best of intentions,

37:57.935 --> 38:01.132
making one questionable decision can...

38:01.171 --> 38:02.832
...lead to such a mess.

38:04.408 --> 38:08.003
I think things are gonna be a mess
for me and Amanda with Mrs. Bloom.

38:08.045 --> 38:12.744
Well, hopefully, in time, she'll cool
off and won't see you as an issue.

38:19.423 --> 38:21.187
Is everything all right, Nicole?

38:23.494 --> 38:24.893
Everything's fine.

38:36.808 --> 38:39.470
Damn it, Josh.
You scared the living...

38:39.510 --> 38:41.239
Hey, hey! You eat with that mouth?

38:41.312 --> 38:43.644
It's been a long day.
What do you want?

38:43.681 --> 38:46.343
We could spend a moment
and reflect on a job well done.

38:46.384 --> 38:49.512
- I can't believe we pulled it off.
- Please.

38:49.554 --> 38:53.615
Child's play to one that is adept
in the black arts of adult deception

38:53.691 --> 38:56.285
as your gifted yet humble brother.

38:57.930 --> 39:01.161
- Lucky Declan was there.
- Yep.

39:02.301 --> 39:05.293
On the saving your bacon scale,
I'd say he scored about 9.

39:05.337 --> 39:09.296
- Hmm, 8.5. What's your point.
- Nothing.

39:10.309 --> 39:14.211
I know I'm a new player in the great
game of adolescent relationships.

39:14.280 --> 39:18.649
But if you ask me, I'd say the Big D
is carrying the proverbial torch.

39:20.653 --> 39:24.248
Yes. He's tasted from the fountain
of Lor, and he wants to dive right...

39:24.323 --> 39:27.315
Finish that sentence,
and they'll never find the body.

39:27.359 --> 39:30.487
- Hey, I was just saying...
- Get out.

39:57.390 --> 39:58.448
Amanda.

39:59.459 --> 40:00.517
Hi.

40:02.996 --> 40:05.123
I'm sorry.
I'm not allowed to let you in.

40:05.165 --> 40:07.395
I'm not allowed to go in.

40:07.434 --> 40:09.334
I just want to make sure you're OK.

40:09.369 --> 40:12.669
I'm still grounded, but I'm fine.
How about you?

40:13.841 --> 40:16.901
My mom and I talked.
She's still hurt and angry, but...

40:16.944 --> 40:20.277
...at least she listened
more than usual this time.

40:21.282 --> 40:22.749
That's encouraging.

40:23.951 --> 40:27.751
Unfortunately, she won't let me see you
outside of school for a while.

40:27.788 --> 40:31.656
And I need to get a job to learn
to be more mature and responsible.

40:31.726 --> 40:34.752
To tell you the truth, after
the way I've handled things,

40:34.829 --> 40:36.057
I don't blame her.

40:37.031 --> 40:39.932
I'll learn to be more mature
and responsible with you.

40:44.071 --> 40:45.504
That song.

40:48.710 --> 40:50.701
That's the one you asked me to play

40:50.779 --> 40:52.713
when you and Jessi
were out somewhere.

40:52.748 --> 40:54.443
Never told me why you needed it.

40:55.817 --> 40:57.785
It helped us get where
we needed to go.

41:05.894 --> 41:06.952
Kyle.

41:07.763 --> 41:10.129
If there's ever anything
you want to tell me...

41:11.767 --> 41:14.930
- I hope you know you can.
- I do know that.

41:16.405 --> 41:17.463
OK.

41:18.840 --> 41:20.000
Well, good night.

41:20.475 --> 41:22.067
Good night.

41:36.993 --> 41:40.224
<i>Only a day had passed
since my decision to hide Amanda,</i>

41:40.296 --> 41:44.096
<i>and allowing her to stay in the house
left her with new questions about me.</i>

41:44.133 --> 41:46.727
<i>Still, I didn't regret
making that choice</i>

41:46.803 --> 41:50.239
<i>because it's worth taking risks to help
the people you care about.</i>

41:50.273 --> 41:53.970
<i>And that day, I knew that my family
was willing to take risks for me,</i>

41:54.010 --> 41:56.945
<i>that our love for each other
could never be questioned,</i>

41:57.013 --> 42:00.176
<i>and that the secrets
we keep remain unexposed.</i>

42:04.488 --> 42:07.719
I've been to his home.
He's very attached to the family.

42:07.791 --> 42:10.157
Could be a problem.

42:14.331 --> 42:17.266
<i>But now I understand
why you believe he's the one.</i>

42:18.368 --> 42:20.131
<i>If there are no further questions,</i>

42:20.204 --> 42:23.605
<i>I'd like to say again what an honor
it is to be of service.</i>
