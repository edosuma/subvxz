then we're both out.

10:32.966 --> 10:33.834

10:35.202 --> 10:37.070
It's not a risk
I'm willing to take.

10:38.538 --> 10:40.908
I said forget it, all right?
It's my problem.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.342
I never should have
tried to make it yours.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.145
Really. It's...
It's all good.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.285
So you
and McHenry were partners?

10:52.419 --> 10:55.823
Yes. We founded Genocyte
in my parents' garage.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.257
He was my oldest friend.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.026
Who you accused
of making a fortune

10:59.159 --> 11:01.128
by stealing your
intellectual property.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.396
You asked how well I knew him,
not what I thought of him.

11:03.530 --> 11:04.364
What did you think of him?

11:05.966 --> 11:08.268
That he was a liar
and a cheat.

<i>No.

to think, or feel.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.830

11:36.964 --> 11:38.999
Well, you're also
very rich now.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.768
McHenry taped
a confession.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.469
He admitted to cheating you

11:42.602 --> 11:44.137
and gave you his share
of the company.

11:45.672 --> 11:47.941
A confession? That's the first
I'm hearing of that.

11:48.075 --> 11:49.709
Well, you spent
years in court

11:49.843 --> 11:51.311
trying to get what
you say you deserved.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.480
Now, you lost, but now...

11:53.613 --> 11:55.883
McHenry winds up dead and
you get everything after all.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.985
Are you suggesting
I had something to
do with his death?

11:58.118 --> 11:59.920
That I killed
my best friend?

12:00.053 --> 12:01.755
You mean the liar
and the cheat?

12:02.956 --> 12:04.457
Sure, that's who he was,

12:04.591 --> 12:06.026
but he was also

12:06.159 --> 12:08.095
my oldest friend.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.729
Where were you
last night?

12:09.863 --> 12:12.800
I had lost in court,
so I was at home,

12:12.933 --> 12:15.268
drinking,
blogging my troubles.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.569
I work in tech, okay?

12:16.703 --> 12:18.071
Screaming into that void

12:18.205 --> 12:19.472

that helps.

12:21.508 --> 12:22.776
Wait. Do you really think

12:22.910 --> 12:24.544
I was at Adam's place
killing him?

12:25.245 --> 12:26.179
Were you?

12:27.514 --> 12:30.217
This conversation's over.
I want my lawyer.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.119
Okay, so, Freeson said
that thing about blogging,

12:32.252 --> 12:34.221
so I looked up
his online footprint,

12:34.354 --> 12:36.489
and the guy's got
profiles everywhere.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.725
And then...
And then I found this.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.260
This is Thread-Net.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.195
It's an online
discussion platform

12:42.329 --> 12:43.897
sort of like Reddit,
and it looks like

12:44.031 --> 12:46.900
Freeson found a deep
subcategory and vented

12:47.034 --> 12:49.602
about the court case,
McHenry, his betrayal.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.839
A category about what?
It is a prayer group.

12:51.972 --> 12:54.274
It's people pouring out
their pain and problems

12:54.407 --> 12:56.243
for divine intervention.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.078

12:59.712 --> 13:01.949
AvengingAngel1317.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.250

our Avenging Angel

17:59.179 --> 18:00.413

a young, unwed mother,

18:06.353 --> 18:08.655

into places like this

18:14.026 --> 18:15.295

18:15.428 --> 18:16.863

like a prisoner

18:16.996 --> 18:18.131

of her pregnancy,

18:18.265 --> 18:19.599
and when she
finally gave birth,

18:19.732 --> 18:21.834
she would have been
forced to give the baby
up for adoption.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.270
