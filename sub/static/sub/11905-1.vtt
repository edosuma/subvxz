02:40.022 --> 02:44.258
My name is Christian thaddeus
Reginald Mcarthur O'Connell,

02:44.260 --> 02:47.261
and between the ages
of 8 and 17 years old,

02:47.263 --> 02:52.233
good old Uncle Sam restationed
my father 12 times.

02:52.235 --> 02:55.803
- Class, please welcome--
- G.I. Joe?

02:55.805 --> 02:59.040
From Wichita to Berlin,

02:59.042 --> 03:01.909
nobody wanted to be
friends with the new kid.

03:01.911 --> 03:04.245
I think G.I. Joe is cool.

03:06.983 --> 03:12.153
Because you have a lot in common

03:12.155 --> 03:14.355
or maybe because you want something

03:14.357 --> 03:17.959
or because no one else
will be your friend.

03:17.961 --> 03:21.162
And that's how I became
friends with Adam Lipschitz.

03:21.164 --> 03:24.098
How rude of me.

03:24.100 --> 03:25.299
Want one?

03:26.769 --> 03:28.369
We were complete opposites,

03:28.371 --> 03:31.772
but we became best friends.

03:31.774 --> 03:36.077
My first dinner with the
lipschitzes--one word.

03:36.079 --> 03:38.012
Why couldn't we have
gone to China palace?

03:38.014 --> 03:41.115
Denny, we've discussed this.

03:41.117 --> 03:43.751
Do you want to drop
dead of a heart attack

03:43.753 --> 03:44.752
by the time you're 50?

03:44.754 --> 03:46.120
No, but--

03:46.122 --> 03:47.655
besides, I heard that they cook

03:47.657 --> 03:50.958
with d-o-g.

03:50.960 --> 03:54.996
Adam's mom took control of her men.

03:54.998 --> 03:56.998
Nah, you're right, Arlene.
You're always right.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.101
- I love you.
- Well, I love you more.

04:00.103 --> 04:02.236
- No, I love you more.
- You just wait till later.

04:02.238 --> 04:04.005
Ooh, is that a threat or a promise?

04:04.007 --> 04:06.107
It kind of freaked
me out at first...

04:07.844 --> 04:10.645
But I learned to love it.

04:10.647 --> 04:13.681
Hi. My name's Soo Yun.
You ready to order?

04:13.683 --> 04:16.317
Stop staring at her, Adam.

04:16.319 --> 04:17.752
That is rude!

04:17.754 --> 04:19.786
- Oh.
- You cute.

04:19.789 --> 04:22.156
You stare all you like, little man.

04:22.158 --> 04:26.727
You are not and you will
never be her little man.

04:26.729 --> 04:30.131
I never realized how different
growing up Jewish was...

04:30.133 --> 04:33.234
Where's my burger?
Betsy!

04:33.236 --> 04:35.403
Until I hung out
with the O'Connells.

04:35.405 --> 04:37.004
I'm Comin'.

04:37.006 --> 04:38.939
I'm sorry, the tots were frozen

04:38.941 --> 04:42.043
and I--and I had to wait
for them to defrost.

04:42.045 --> 04:46.881
And where's my Uncle Brian's
barbecue sauce, huh?

04:46.883 --> 04:48.883
One word--gentiles.

04:48.885 --> 04:51.919
Oh, I got distracted
waiting for them tots.

04:51.921 --> 04:54.355
I'll go get it.
Don't you move an inch.

04:54.357 --> 04:55.890
Way back!
And he sees Taylor!

04:55.892 --> 04:58.192
And the throw is up!

04:58.194 --> 05:00.695
Aah! Touchdown!

05:00.697 --> 05:02.196
Oh!

05:02.198 --> 05:04.465
What the hell?
That's a touchdown.

05:04.467 --> 05:06.333
I'll tell you one thing.

05:06.335 --> 05:09.437
There's nobody who called a
better game than Cosell,

05:09.439 --> 05:14.008
but boy, did he have him
one heck of a beak.

05:14.010 --> 05:16.277
Jew beak.

05:19.781 --> 05:22.383
The talmud states that
the first 12 years

05:22.385 --> 05:25.720
of a Jewish man's life all
lead up to the moment

05:25.722 --> 05:28.055
where he must transform himself

05:28.057 --> 05:29.824
from a boy to a man.

05:29.826 --> 05:33.360
Adam Mintz Lipschitz,
that moment has arrived.

05:33.362 --> 05:36.363
I'd never been to any
jewy type of thing

05:36.365 --> 05:38.799
until Adam's bar mitzvah.

05:52.114 --> 05:53.481
Gaah!

05:53.483 --> 05:55.916
I'm not ready to be a man!

05:55.918 --> 05:59.019
I'm not ready to be a man!
I'm not ready to be a man!

05:59.021 --> 06:01.322
I'm not ready!
I'm not ready!

06:01.324 --> 06:02.990
I'm not ready to be a man!

06:02.992 --> 06:05.092
And your fault.

06:05.094 --> 06:07.895
- I'm not ready to be a man!
- What the hell was that?

06:07.897 --> 06:10.331
Bar Mitzvahs rock!

06:10.333 --> 06:14.869
Christian didn't always come
up with the smartest ideas.

06:14.871 --> 06:16.337
Nobody calls me G.I. Joe.

06:16.339 --> 06:19.507
My mom told me that if
your hand touches poo,

06:19.509 --> 06:21.242
you can get psoriasis.

06:21.244 --> 06:22.543
Yeah, whatever.

06:22.545 --> 06:24.812
Launch sequence activated.

06:24.814 --> 06:28.149
3, 2, 1.
Commence fire!

06:30.153 --> 06:32.119
Mission abort!
Mission abort!

06:32.121 --> 06:34.188
It might look like I'm
having a seizure.

06:34.190 --> 06:35.990
I'm not.
This is a panic attack.

06:35.992 --> 06:38.259
Get up Lipschitz, get up!

06:38.261 --> 06:39.260
I can't, Chris.

06:40.830 --> 06:43.564
- Get up!
- Sons of bitches!

06:43.566 --> 06:49.136
Do either of you know
what time it is?

06:49.138 --> 06:51.172
3:07 A.M., sir.

06:51.174 --> 06:55.176
And what do I like to do
at 3:07 A.M.?

06:55.178 --> 06:56.544
Sleep, sir.

06:56.546 --> 06:58.913
Apparently, the two of you don't.

06:58.915 --> 07:04.151
You two would rather be
launching bags of feces.

07:04.153 --> 07:05.853
I need a word with you in private.

07:08.857 --> 07:10.825
Feces?

07:10.827 --> 07:12.993
In here.

07:12.995 --> 07:16.831
You see, my son would have
executed like a real marine

07:16.833 --> 07:20.000
if it hadn't been for
private Lipschitz,

07:20.002 --> 07:22.102
who had a brain fart.

07:22.104 --> 07:24.972
He screwed up the entire operation.

07:24.974 --> 07:28.142
Now what the heck kind
of a weird shit is that?

07:28.144 --> 07:30.845
- It's a pulmo machine.
- English!

07:30.847 --> 07:32.213
It's for his asthma.

07:32.215 --> 07:35.316
So your boy, he's
got a fake disease?

07:35.318 --> 07:37.985
I'll bet you make him
wear a seatbelt too.

07:37.987 --> 07:39.987
How is your boy still alive?

07:39.989 --> 07:41.522
Seriously, how?

07:41.524 --> 07:46.393
All I can say is, I
thank God and Uncle Sam

07:46.395 --> 07:50.331
that I have been restationed.

07:50.333 --> 07:52.533
- Schmuck.
- Come on, Christian.

07:52.535 --> 07:54.034
Let's move.
Come on.

07:54.036 --> 07:55.936
Where are we moving to, dad?

07:55.938 --> 07:58.906
Camp blue Jean, South Carolina.

07:58.908 --> 08:01.175
But I don't want to
move again, dad. I like it here.

08:01.177 --> 08:02.576
Oh, you like it here?
You're gonna love it there.

08:02.578 --> 08:04.211
Adam's the best
friend I've ever had.

08:04.213 --> 08:05.613
Come on, Chris.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.016
Chris is the best
friend that I've ever--

08:08.584 --> 08:10.551
Move.

08:13.923 --> 08:17.157
He was the only Jew I ever knew.

08:17.159 --> 08:19.894
But then... College.

08:19.896 --> 08:22.229
Could you maybe not mix the
potassium permanganate

08:22.231 --> 08:27.201
I prefer to not explode
before graduation.

08:27.203 --> 08:30.237
- Here. Use the hydrazine.
- Thanks.

08:30.239 --> 08:34.241
Her name was Rebecca
Hadassah Zahada Ogin.

08:34.243 --> 08:38.279
You know, me and you have
really good chemistry.

08:38.280 --> 08:42.383
And just like that, all of
my decisions went away.

08:42.385 --> 08:44.685
Oh, I'm gonna have an order
of the fried mozzarella sticks.

08:44.687 --> 08:47.454
I didn't have to
decide what to eat...

08:47.456 --> 08:50.291
- Surprise.
- What?

08:50.293 --> 08:52.559
I didn't have to decide
what clothes to buy.

08:52.561 --> 08:54.428
Oh!

08:54.430 --> 08:56.630
Who my friends were gonna be.

08:58.167 --> 09:00.301
I'm sorry, dudes, but Chris' gpa

09:00.303 --> 09:02.603
has dropped over the
past two quarters,

09:02.605 --> 09:06.307
so he will no longer be
hosting poker night.

09:06.309 --> 09:10.110
I'm coming to you live from
the university of Colorado,

09:10.112 --> 09:14.715
Yeah! I'm standing here with
a hot and busty young co-Ed.

09:14.717 --> 09:18.018
Say hi for the--
for the audience, Rebecca.

09:18.020 --> 09:20.321
- Hi.
- Wow.

09:20.323 --> 09:22.156
Now Rebecca has just informed me

09:22.158 --> 09:24.658
underneath her graduation gown.

09:24.660 --> 09:26.327
Is that true, Rebecca?

09:26.329 --> 09:28.329
That is true, vance,

09:28.331 --> 09:31.665
and I dare you
to get a close-up.

09:35.972 --> 09:37.304
Stop.
Get out.

09:37.306 --> 09:39.139
Oh, my God.
You're so beautiful.

09:39.141 --> 09:41.342
I just--I found this
beautiful little pink box.

09:41.344 --> 09:43.243
You're disgusting.

09:43.245 --> 09:45.579
No, look. Really.

09:47.516 --> 09:50.451
Marry me, Rebecca.

09:52.455 --> 09:57.691
Look, these last three years
have been a lot of fun together,

09:57.693 --> 10:00.094
but we're entering
the real world now,

10:00.096 --> 10:04.164
and in the real world,
this can't work.

10:04.166 --> 10:06.133
Why not?

10:06.135 --> 10:09.269
Because you're not Jewish.

10:10.438 --> 10:13.674
Wait.
What are you saying?

10:13.676 --> 10:16.577
It's over, Christian.

10:19.782 --> 10:21.648
And now I'm a 31-year-old plumber,

10:21.650 --> 10:24.351
still crying over his
college girlfriend.

10:24.353 --> 10:26.320
I miss Bec-Bec.

10:26.322 --> 10:28.689
Okay, I located that one!

10:28.691 --> 10:31.091
70 pounds of pressure
rising! Over!

10:31.093 --> 10:34.495
Okay. Locating
the septic tank!

10:34.497 --> 10:38.432
Looking at 85 pounds
and rising! Over!

10:38.434 --> 10:40.234
Are you there, boss?
Over!

10:40.236 --> 10:42.236
Yeah, guys, I'm here.
Sorry, sorry.

10:42.238 --> 10:44.638
And did you find the gas line?

10:44.640 --> 10:46.140
Yeah, got it.

10:46.142 --> 10:49.576
- Got it too.
- Okay, boss.

10:49.578 --> 10:51.345
We're going to shut
them both down, okay?

10:51.347 --> 10:53.747
<i>Tres, dos,</i> shut off!

10:56.652 --> 10:58.419
Guys, I'm really sorry.

10:58.421 --> 11:00.220
I don't know what happened.
I must have spaced out.

11:00.222 --> 11:03.157
It's cool, boss.
No worries.

11:03.159 --> 11:05.092
I space out too sometime.

11:05.094 --> 11:06.660
But if it was my responsibility

11:06.662 --> 11:08.362
to turn off the gas and sewer lines

11:08.364 --> 11:12.533
of my loyal, hardworking,
underpaid employees

11:12.535 --> 11:14.535
next to a leaking septic tank

11:14.537 --> 11:17.638
with 10,000 pounds of raw sewage,

11:17.640 --> 11:20.207
I would not fucking space out!

11:20.209 --> 11:21.408
Sorry. What'd you say?
I spaced out.

11:21.410 --> 11:24.244
<i>Ay, madre de dios!</i>

11:24.246 --> 11:25.846
<i>Que es eso?</i>
<i>What is that?</i>

11:25.848 --> 11:27.481
- What?
- <i>Que es eso? Que--</i>

11:27.483 --> 11:32.152
What was I thinking, coming
to work with you today?

11:32.154 --> 11:34.521
- It's may 25th.
- <i>Oye, cinco de Mayo?</i>

11:34.523 --> 11:37.191
No, <i>pendejo, may 25th is the day</i>

11:37.193 --> 11:39.393
that this <i>chica</i> Rebecca
dumped him nine years ago.

11:39.395 --> 11:45.466
And accidentally hooked
it up to the hot water?

11:46.535 --> 11:48.102
Boiling toilet day.

11:48.104 --> 11:50.170
Boss, I loved that day, man.

11:50.172 --> 11:52.239
I went to take a crap and
the toilet exploded!

11:52.241 --> 11:54.274
I still have porcelain in my ass.

11:54.276 --> 11:56.477
Look, boss, me and Juan, okay,

11:56.479 --> 11:57.478
we love you, okay?

11:57.480 --> 12:01.482
Of risking our life for this <i>puta!</i>

12:01.484 --> 12:03.417
Look, just do us both a favor.

12:03.419 --> 12:05.285
Go out there and find
yourself another <i>puta</i>

12:05.287 --> 12:07.287
and move on with your life, <i>puto!</i>

12:07.289 --> 12:09.623
You get on with your
life, you <i>puto!</i>

12:09.625 --> 12:13.160
Boss, can I go to the bathroom?

12:13.162 --> 12:15.162
Mm-Hmm.

12:16.165 --> 12:17.164
Have you ever dreamed

12:17.166 --> 12:23.403
embroidered on your
favorite undies?

12:23.405 --> 12:26.473
What about your gang name
on your baseball cap?

12:26.475 --> 12:29.610
Malt 40! Unh!
Manatee! Uh-huh!

12:29.612 --> 12:32.479
Goldie tooth!

12:32.481 --> 12:36.517
Then come on down to
the embroidery palace.

12:36.519 --> 12:38.452
Where our royal family has provided

12:38.454 --> 12:41.622
the highest quality custom
embroidery for 50 years!

12:41.624 --> 12:45.859
No Booty too big,
no Booty too small,

12:45.861 --> 12:48.428
because here at the
embroidery palace,

12:48.430 --> 12:49.897
we embroider it all!

12:49.899 --> 12:52.633
- What the hell?
- Oh, damn it!

12:52.635 --> 12:55.335
Sorry. I told her
not to call again.

12:55.337 --> 12:56.737
Could you be any
more pussy-whipped?

12:56.739 --> 12:58.372
Rreow!

12:58.374 --> 12:59.373
Yeah. What now?

12:59.375 --> 13:02.442
Stuck working for
the family business

13:02.444 --> 13:04.211
and engaged to Hannah Daniels.

13:04.213 --> 13:05.679
This is her 13th call.

13:05.681 --> 13:07.848
Yes, I'm available
after 3:00 tomorrow.

13:07.850 --> 13:08.949
Why?

13:08.951 --> 13:12.519
Why would we have a
preschool interview?

13:12.521 --> 13:15.255
You're not even pregnant yet!

13:15.257 --> 13:16.757
No, Hannah, it's smart
to interview now.

13:16.759 --> 13:20.360
This commercial is
costing me an assload.

13:20.362 --> 13:22.229
- Get off the phone!
- Okay, I gotta go.

13:22.231 --> 13:25.933
I gotta go.
Yes, I love you. Bye.

13:25.935 --> 13:30.837
Why didn't you cover
that before the shoot?

13:30.839 --> 13:33.440
Do you want people to
change the channel

13:33.442 --> 13:36.310
Would you prefer our
family go broke?

13:36.312 --> 13:37.811
Oh, mom, no!
Come on, mom!

13:37.813 --> 13:39.346
Oh, no. Stop moving.

13:39.348 --> 13:41.615
No, not the safety pin!
Come on!

13:41.617 --> 13:47.221
- Hold his head.
- Well, you know what?

13:47.223 --> 13:48.855
If my brother wasn't such a douche

13:48.857 --> 13:49.890
and his psycho fiancee
wasn't calling him

13:49.892 --> 13:50.891
every two minutes--

13:50.893 --> 13:53.961
She's the best thing that
ever happened to your brother.

13:53.963 --> 13:57.564
- Ow!
- I got it! I got it!

13:58.800 --> 14:01.602
What the hell?

14:01.604 --> 14:05.572
Excuse me!
Excuse me!

14:06.741 --> 14:08.375
What's--
what's going on here?

14:09.745 --> 14:13.313
Hannah!
Hannah!

14:14.515 --> 14:16.783
Oh, fuck me!
A jackhammer?

14:16.785 --> 14:18.552
Come--Hannah!

14:18.554 --> 14:22.956
You can always call me at
home when there's a problem.

14:22.958 --> 14:24.891
Why do you think I was ranked
number one gynecologist

14:24.893 --> 14:26.727
by city quest three years in a row?

14:26.729 --> 14:29.429
Just remember, no matter
how much it might itch,

14:29.431 --> 14:30.631
I don't want you to scratch it.

14:30.633 --> 14:32.466
Okay, bye.

14:32.468 --> 14:36.403
Oh, hey, I didn't
hear you sneak in.

14:36.405 --> 14:39.506
Oh, probably 'cause of the
jackhammer that's outside.

14:39.508 --> 14:43.477
Fine. What the hell
is going on around here?

14:43.479 --> 14:44.778
They're starting construction
on the baby's room.

14:44.780 --> 14:49.816
Honey, I-I know that you
want to have a baby so bad,

14:49.818 --> 14:52.819
and so do I, in the future,
but there is no baby

14:52.821 --> 14:54.788
to build a room for yet.

14:54.790 --> 14:56.723
There's not even--
not even a fetus

14:56.725 --> 14:58.058
to build a room for yet.

14:58.060 --> 14:59.826
But it can take up to 18 months

14:59.828 --> 15:02.663
to complete construction
on the series six BPBC.

15:02.665 --> 15:05.732
I'm sorry. BPBC?

15:07.335 --> 15:09.603
- Baby protection bed chamber.
- Oh, God.

15:09.605 --> 15:12.639
You enter here, through the
anti-bacterial wash chamber

15:12.641 --> 15:14.574
to disinfect and put
on sterilized scrubs.

15:14.576 --> 15:16.843
Once inside, you'll be surrounded

15:16.845 --> 15:21.915
a six-inch-thick bullet and
germ-proof baby encasement unit,

15:21.917 --> 15:24.418
24-hour closed circuit
video surveillance,

15:24.420 --> 15:26.553
life-size parental control
reinforcements,

15:26.555 --> 15:28.655
Anthrax detector, radon detector,

15:28.657 --> 15:30.657
carbon monoxide detector,
smoke detector,

15:30.659 --> 15:32.626
and faulty detector detector,

15:32.628 --> 15:34.494
and a panic room.

15:34.496 --> 15:35.495
And--and--and what is this?

15:35.497 --> 15:40.967
Just in case the panic room
gets overrun by terrorists.

15:40.969 --> 15:43.637
- Terrorists?
- Terrorists.

15:44.907 --> 15:46.773
Well, thank God that's optional.

15:46.775 --> 15:49.676
Oh, I'll be exercising that option.

15:49.678 --> 15:52.713
♪ <i>You're really gone again</i> ♪

15:52.715 --> 15:56.350
♪ <i>if you know what I mean</i> ♪

15:56.352 --> 15:58.852
- ♪ <i>we're two of...</i> ♪
- ♪ <i>We're two of a kind</i> ♪

15:58.854 --> 16:01.922
♪ <i>a kind</i> ♪

16:07.129 --> 16:09.363
Working on a dream.

16:10.466 --> 16:12.366
And then it hit me

16:12.368 --> 16:14.534
harder than Dale earnhardt
hitting that wall,

16:14.536 --> 16:15.702
rest in peace.

16:15.704 --> 16:19.406
I needed to find another <i>puta.</i>

16:19.408 --> 16:21.074
A Jewish <i>puta.</i>

16:21.076 --> 16:22.409
How you Doin'?

16:23.746 --> 16:25.979
Hey, I'm Christian.

16:28.116 --> 16:29.883
Hey, you remember when Cheney

16:29.885 --> 16:32.386
shotgunned that old guy
in the face back in '06?

16:32.388 --> 16:35.155
I mean, I felt bad
for him, didn't you?

16:35.157 --> 16:37.591
Hey, so you been a
Jew your whole life?

16:37.593 --> 16:40.394
Damn, a lot of hot
Jew pussy in here.

16:40.396 --> 16:41.995
Hey, am I right?

16:41.997 --> 16:45.465
No, bad. Bad, bad, bad, bad.

16:51.140 --> 16:52.773
That is a very nice getup.

16:52.775 --> 16:54.508
Where did you get that stuff?

16:54.510 --> 16:55.776
Thanks. I'm glad
you're having a good time.

16:55.778 --> 16:58.678
It's mine.

16:58.680 --> 16:59.679
You like it?

16:59.681 --> 17:00.847
It's hysterical.

17:00.849 --> 17:05.085
About the whole thing.

17:05.087 --> 17:07.854
So how did it go in there?

17:07.856 --> 17:09.623
Bad.

17:09.625 --> 17:10.624
I don't think the girls around here

17:10.626 --> 17:11.625
like a guy like me.

17:11.627 --> 17:12.759
Well, that's crazy.

17:12.761 --> 17:13.760
I mean, what girl here

17:13.762 --> 17:16.930
with a whacked-out
sense of humor?

17:16.932 --> 17:18.432
So you, uh,

17:18.434 --> 17:21.468
Only the ones that
my mother organizes.

17:21.470 --> 17:23.103
Your mother.

17:23.105 --> 17:24.704
She organized this?

17:24.705 --> 17:26.039
Yeah, and if I didn't show up,

17:26.040 --> 17:27.040
I would never hear the end of it.

17:27.041 --> 17:29.176
Yeah, I know how that is.

17:29.178 --> 17:33.013
You should take my number.

17:33.015 --> 17:34.815
For what?

17:34.817 --> 17:36.783
To call me.

17:36.785 --> 17:39.019
Okay. Yeah, okay.

17:39.021 --> 17:40.587
Five missed calls.

17:40.589 --> 17:44.224
- Oh, who's your provider?
- Pin mobile.

17:44.226 --> 17:46.126
Well, that's your
problem right there.

17:46.128 --> 17:47.828
Pin mobile has the least amount
of coverage in L.A. county

17:47.830 --> 17:51.631
You should switch
to AT&T Nation 900

17:51.633 --> 17:53.600
with unlimited mobile to mobile.

17:53.602 --> 17:55.469
Thanks.

17:55.471 --> 17:56.636
Alison.

17:56.638 --> 17:58.238
Alison Marks.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.574
And you are?

18:01.242 --> 18:03.844
Ro--Rosenberg.

18:03.846 --> 18:06.179
Avi Rosenberg.

18:06.181 --> 18:08.748
Man, you do not look Jewish.

18:08.750 --> 18:11.518
Really? I--you know,
I have gotten that.

18:12.520 --> 18:14.688
I'm gonna head back in.

18:15.857 --> 18:19.159
Okay.

18:19.161 --> 18:20.694
Avi.

18:20.696 --> 18:21.862
Rosenberg.

18:21.864 --> 18:23.029
I'm gonna head back in.

18:23.031 --> 18:25.799
Okay.

18:25.801 --> 18:27.501
Bye.

18:30.104 --> 18:32.706
Are you fucking loco, boss?

18:32.708 --> 18:35.609
- You no Jew!
- I know I'm not a Jew.

18:35.611 --> 18:37.511
- She's just like Rebecca.
- <i>Ay, dios mio!</i>

18:37.513 --> 18:39.145
Listen, I don't know why I said it!

18:39.147 --> 18:42.516
Well, maybe you should
just tell her the truth.

18:42.518 --> 18:45.218
I'm not gonna tell her the truth,

18:45.220 --> 18:46.920
'cause then she's
never gonna date me.

18:46.922 --> 18:48.188
I'm just gonna keep
telling her I'm a Jew

18:48.190 --> 18:52.893
Juan, I don't care how
big her tits are!

18:52.895 --> 18:54.261
But, I mean, they're pretty good.

18:54.263 --> 18:57.163
Just because you say you're a
Jew does not make you one!

18:57.165 --> 19:01.001
I don't know what I was thinking!

19:01.003 --> 19:02.736
Hey, you know, boss,

19:02.738 --> 19:04.738
Jesus was a Jew.

19:04.740 --> 19:07.140
Why don't you just
tell her you're Jesus?

19:07.142 --> 19:10.010
Huh? <i>De nada.</i>

19:10.012 --> 19:11.945
Come on down to the
embroidery palace.

19:11.947 --> 19:14.247
Where our royal family has provided

19:14.249 --> 19:18.752
the highest quality custom
embroidery for 50 years.

19:18.754 --> 19:20.320
Adam Lipschitz!

19:20.322 --> 19:22.022
This had to be a sign.

19:22.024 --> 19:26.560
No Booty too big,
no Booty too small,

19:26.562 --> 19:29.129
because here at embroidery palace,

19:29.131 --> 19:31.131
we embroider it all!

19:31.133 --> 19:34.000
A Jewish sign!

19:34.002 --> 19:36.036
All right.

19:36.038 --> 19:39.306
I want everybody to close your eyes

19:39.308 --> 19:42.642
and forget everything
you think you know

19:42.644 --> 19:44.110
about embroidery,

19:44.112 --> 19:46.212
because starting next Tuesday,

19:46.214 --> 19:49.282
the embroidery palace
will be in possession

19:49.284 --> 19:51.952
of this bad boy!

19:51.954 --> 19:56.323
Behold the mauter evolution
30-70!

19:58.793 --> 20:02.195
Okay. On to
the next piece of business,

20:02.197 --> 20:05.198
which is our monthly
corporate account review.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.800
Jillie Bean, can you pass out

20:09.271 --> 20:11.638
Now, as you all know,

20:11.640 --> 20:13.106
the handlebar coffee company

20:13.108 --> 20:15.709
has been our largest
corporate client

20:15.711 --> 20:17.077
for the past ten--

20:17.079 --> 20:18.345
Years.

20:19.781 --> 20:21.381
They notified me this morning

20:21.383 --> 20:25.051
they will be taking their
business elsewhere

20:25.053 --> 20:27.187
due to this.

20:28.190 --> 20:31.858
Do you have any idea how
this could have happened?

20:31.860 --> 20:34.327
One sec, dad.

20:34.329 --> 20:35.362
- Adam!
- What?

20:35.364 --> 20:38.932
Oh, my God!
Oh, God.

20:38.934 --> 20:42.836
I "cun't" --I can't believe
that I did that.

20:42.838 --> 20:45.105
But I'm under a lot of pressure
with this whole wedding thing!

20:45.107 --> 20:47.874
I got--I got Hannah nagging me
about brunch tomorrow.

20:47.876 --> 20:51.311
It's--I must have forgotten
to double-check the sample.

20:51.313 --> 20:53.146
You should fire the prince, dad.

20:53.148 --> 20:56.049
Oh, I'd like to chop
off the prince's head,

20:56.051 --> 20:58.818
but then there'd be nobody
to ascend the throne!

20:58.820 --> 21:00.687
Paging prince Adam.

21:00.689 --> 21:02.956
There's a Mr. Christian
O'Connell here to see you.

21:02.958 --> 21:05.392
Christian O'Connell?

21:05.394 --> 21:07.360
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Come back here.

21:07.362 --> 21:08.762
What--what's the big deal?

21:08.764 --> 21:12.999
You--you tell some girl
your name is Avi Rosenberg

21:13.001 --> 21:16.403
and then you show up after 17
years so that--that I can

21:16.405 --> 21:18.405
teach you how to be a Jew
so you can dupe her?

21:18.407 --> 21:21.441
Listen, I've been
dumped by a Jew before.

21:21.443 --> 21:22.809
I'm not letting it happen again.

21:22.811 --> 21:23.810
It's not pretty, man.

21:23.812 --> 21:25.345
All right, why me?

21:25.347 --> 21:30.250
You gotta teach me how
to pass myself off

21:30.252 --> 21:31.284
as one of you guys.

21:31.286 --> 21:36.756
Another decision for
as long as I live.

21:36.758 --> 21:40.126
Wow. That's mildly offensive,
you know that?

21:40.128 --> 21:42.028
Yes, but true.

21:42.030 --> 21:45.365
Tell her the truth and
then convert for her.

21:45.367 --> 21:47.367
No. No, no, no, no. No.
Listen to me.

21:47.369 --> 21:49.803
Alison Marks is not gonna
settle for imitation Jew.

21:49.805 --> 21:51.905
She can have the real deal.
Now, come on, Adam.

21:51.907 --> 21:53.339
- Just help me.
- I'm sorry.

21:53.341 --> 21:55.475
Did you say her name
was Alison Marks?

21:55.477 --> 21:56.976
Yeah, Alison Marks.
Why?

21:56.978 --> 21:57.977
I went to Sunday school

21:57.979 --> 21:59.879
with an Alison Marks.

21:59.881 --> 22:01.815
Okay.

22:01.817 --> 22:03.983
Did--did she tell you
what her family did?

22:03.985 --> 22:07.220
Her family? Her mother, uh,
organized the mixer.

22:07.222 --> 22:09.456
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You know them, don't you?

22:09.458 --> 22:12.425
- Do you know them?
- Yeah, you could say that.

22:12.427 --> 22:14.928
- What?
- Oh! Oh, I know, I know.

22:14.930 --> 22:18.231
Chris, this is, uh, you know,

22:18.233 --> 22:23.503
are--are--are seeing
what I'm doing here,

22:23.505 --> 22:26.306
but I-I got a lot
of shit going on right now,

22:26.308 --> 22:29.175
and my--sort of, my world's
flipped upside down

22:29.177 --> 22:32.412
and--and--and--and we're
looking for preschools.

22:32.414 --> 22:37.217
Wait a minute. You didn't
tell me you had a baby.

22:37.219 --> 22:39.753
- Yeah. I-I don't.
- Oh.

22:39.755 --> 22:41.154
- It's complicated.
- Sounds it.

22:41.156 --> 22:43.189
Chris, I don't think I'm the guy

22:43.191 --> 22:44.791
for this adventure.

22:44.793 --> 22:47.193
Okay.

22:47.195 --> 22:48.762
I understand.

22:48.764 --> 22:49.863
Yeah.

22:49.865 --> 22:50.864
Well, um, you know,

22:50.866 --> 22:53.166
I'm glad I tracked you down.

22:53.168 --> 22:54.934
No, it's great to see you.

22:54.936 --> 22:56.002
So, maybe we'll--
we'll do some lunch,

22:56.004 --> 22:57.771
uh, we'll catch up.

22:57.773 --> 22:59.405
I would love to do some lunch.
Yeah, that'd be fun.

22:59.407 --> 23:01.341
I'm gonna be up on my parents'
ranch for the weekend,

23:01.343 --> 23:05.445
- maybe we'll get a, uh--
- Well, here.

23:05.447 --> 23:06.846
- Coffee.
- Uh, take this.

23:06.848 --> 23:08.314
Embroidery palace.

23:08.316 --> 23:11.284
It's a nice yellow.
Yeah.

23:11.286 --> 23:13.419
Awesome.

23:16.223 --> 23:18.858
Don't take this the
wrong way, Hannah,

23:18.860 --> 23:21.161
but what led you to
diagnose it as vaginitis?

23:21.163 --> 23:23.329
Well, dad, she was
experiencing itching,

23:23.331 --> 23:26.065
irritation, abnormal discharge,
and pain during intercourse--

23:26.067 --> 23:29.536
Yes, those are the basic
symptoms to vaginitis.

23:29.538 --> 23:32.305
They could indicate vulvitis?

23:32.307 --> 23:33.873
Yes, dad, but I ruled out vulvitis

23:33.875 --> 23:35.175
because her vulva was not enflamed.

23:35.177 --> 23:36.943
No need to get defensive, sweetie.

23:36.945 --> 23:38.945
You're probably right
with your diagnosis.

23:38.947 --> 23:42.015
I once diagnosed a
patient with vaginitis

23:42.017 --> 23:45.084
- You know what?
- It might have even been

23:45.086 --> 23:46.519
bacterial vaginosis.

23:46.521 --> 23:50.924
In my 25 years of practice,

23:50.926 --> 23:52.592
I have seen many cases of vaginosis

23:52.594 --> 23:54.260
with no gray discharge.

23:54.262 --> 23:58.431
We've been doing this a
few more years than you,

23:58.433 --> 24:01.968
distinguish between vaginosis,
vaginitis, or vulvitis.

24:01.970 --> 24:04.604
- Lox, honey?
- Cottage cheese?

24:04.606 --> 24:07.207
Okay, excuse me.
I'm just gonna...

24:07.209 --> 24:10.944
Use the bathroom.
I'll--I'll be back.

24:18.452 --> 24:20.520
Hold it.
Bets...

24:20.522 --> 24:25.091
Why don't you and the ladies
hand out some eggnog?

24:25.093 --> 24:27.360
All right.

24:27.362 --> 24:28.928
Thanks, mom.

24:28.930 --> 24:32.565
- Nog, baby?
- Second that.

24:32.567 --> 24:34.934
Oh, mama, that is some good nog.

24:34.936 --> 24:37.203
Son, why is it that you
haven't found yourself

24:37.205 --> 24:38.972
a good woman yet? Huh?

24:38.974 --> 24:41.207
Someone to take care of you...
Serve you nog.

24:41.209 --> 24:44.143
Maybe it's 'cause Christian's
a <i>homo-sexu-wahl!</i>

24:44.145 --> 24:46.012
All right, you stop
bullying your brother.

24:46.014 --> 24:49.082
- He will find himself a girl...
- That's right.

24:49.084 --> 24:50.183
Or whatever, when
he's good and ready?

24:50.185 --> 24:53.052
I'm ready to bag me a 10-pointer,

24:53.054 --> 24:54.554
and I'm gonna skin him, gut him,

24:54.556 --> 24:56.990
- and pull out his rectum.
- The hell you are!

24:56.992 --> 24:59.559
I'm pulling out the
rectum, ass tar!

24:59.561 --> 25:02.629
He always pulls out the rectums.

25:02.631 --> 25:04.497
You make a circular incision and--

25:04.499 --> 25:06.566
Clayton, Chuck!
Over here now!

25:06.568 --> 25:08.134
Hurry up, there's come
rectum over there.

25:08.136 --> 25:10.336
You two take a knee.

25:10.338 --> 25:13.006
Why do you always
have to fight over

25:13.008 --> 25:15.074
who's gonna pull the rectum?

25:15.076 --> 25:18.912
You know, that's not what
hunting is all about.

25:18.914 --> 25:21.080
Hunting is about the family.

25:21.082 --> 25:23.182
It's about teamwork.

25:23.184 --> 25:25.418
It's about finding peace.

25:25.420 --> 25:27.520
Hello?

25:27.522 --> 25:29.389
That night, when we were
T.P.Ing Tim Baker's house,

25:29.391 --> 25:32.358
and I had one of my attacks,
and I tripped and I fell,

25:32.360 --> 25:35.295
you could have left me there

25:35.297 --> 25:39.465
- So rude!
- Okay, one second.

25:39.467 --> 25:42.235
Just--
but you didn't...

25:42.237 --> 25:44.570
Because you were my best friend.

25:44.572 --> 25:48.174
And best friends are always
there for each other.

25:48.176 --> 25:50.576
Moose!

25:50.578 --> 25:52.979
- Yo!
- Fuck yeah!

25:52.981 --> 25:54.514
Beauty, ain't he?

25:54.516 --> 25:59.319
But they threw in the matte
finish horn sheen package.

25:59.321 --> 26:01.988
Unh. Hey, do you like
where I put him?

26:01.990 --> 26:05.959
I could put him between the
bass and the boar's ass.

26:05.961 --> 26:10.063
The plan was to remove all
traces of gentile from Chris,

26:10.065 --> 26:13.166
which turned out to
be a very big task.

26:13.168 --> 26:15.268
I don't get why I have
to sell my truck.

26:15.270 --> 26:17.370
Because Volvos are practical
and they're safe,

26:17.372 --> 26:21.975
But I'm never gonna be able
to fit my kill into a Volvo.

26:21.977 --> 26:23.609
That's why you're
selling the moose head.

26:23.611 --> 26:25.111
All right, $200 it is.

26:25.113 --> 26:27.113
- Deal.
- All right.

26:27.115 --> 26:29.282
Take that with you.
No, let him take it.

26:29.284 --> 26:30.717
Chris, let him take it!

26:30.719 --> 26:32.118
- I'm giving it to him.
- No, you're not.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.153
You're holding on to it.

26:34.155 --> 26:37.657
All right.
That's inappropriate.

26:37.659 --> 26:39.559
- No. Salmon!
- Stop it.

26:41.429 --> 26:43.329
So uh, you think I'm gonna
be ready for tomorrow night?

26:43.331 --> 26:45.098
Ow, ow, ow.

26:45.100 --> 26:46.499
Yes, just do what I said,
and you'll be fine.

26:46.501 --> 26:48.167
Tell me again why I'm doing this.

26:48.169 --> 26:50.169
Because the law states
that you can't be buried

26:50.171 --> 26:52.205
in a Jewish cemetery if
you've desecrated your body

26:52.207 --> 26:53.339
with tattoos, markings,
or piercings.

26:53.341 --> 26:54.607
Well, that's stupid.

26:54.609 --> 26:56.309
You're dead already.
Who cares?

26:56.311 --> 26:59.178
Have you been taken
care of down there?

26:59.180 --> 27:00.413
Down where?

27:00.415 --> 27:01.714
Have you been circumcised?

27:01.716 --> 27:02.715
- Sorry.
- No.

27:02.717 --> 27:08.187
Besides, it's not that noticeable.

27:08.189 --> 27:10.023
It is noticeable!
Mine looks normal,

27:10.025 --> 27:12.225
and yours looks like a--
like an anteater.

27:12.227 --> 27:14.427
Get that--

27:14.429 --> 27:16.295
get it off of there, man.

27:16.297 --> 27:18.798
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

27:18.800 --> 27:21.134
If Chris was gonna stand
a chance with Alison,

27:21.136 --> 27:23.403
he needed a crash course
in the way of the Jew.

27:23.405 --> 27:26.072
Now, I'm your date, and
I need you to give me

27:26.074 --> 27:28.408
seven yiddish words that
you will casually slip

27:28.410 --> 27:29.575
into the conversation.

27:29.577 --> 27:31.778
- Go.
- Goyim.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.212
The second the waiter approaches,

27:33.214 --> 27:36.082
what do you do?

27:36.084 --> 27:38.518
Oh, uh, I'm feeling
a bit of a draft.

27:38.520 --> 27:40.286
Would it be all right if
we move to another table?

27:40.288 --> 27:41.621
Schvitz.

27:41.623 --> 27:42.688
Good. Now, you've
been relocated

27:42.690 --> 27:44.624
to the new table,

27:44.626 --> 27:48.361
and what do you do?

27:48.363 --> 27:50.463
Oh, could you please turn
down that loud music?

27:50.465 --> 27:53.633
All right, now we're on
to the ordering process.

27:53.635 --> 27:55.635
Now, you have to
remember that as a Jew,

27:55.637 --> 27:57.737
you have to take
something on the menu

27:57.739 --> 28:01.274
and alter it beyond
all recognition.

28:01.276 --> 28:02.775
- All right?
- Okay.

28:02.777 --> 28:08.347
To change that side
salad to an entree,

28:08.349 --> 28:11.117
and would you mind throwing
a little salmon in there?

28:11.119 --> 28:12.852
Nosh.

28:12.854 --> 28:14.854
Uh, can I have that on the side?

28:14.856 --> 28:16.622
- Pupik.
- Dinner comes.

28:16.624 --> 28:19.625
The salad is exactly how
you ordered it, right?

28:19.627 --> 28:24.263
- Right.
- Take one bite, and you--

28:24.265 --> 28:26.432
- send it back.
- Yes, you send that shit back!

28:26.434 --> 28:28.468
We never eat what we order.

28:28.470 --> 28:30.603
- Ever, ever, ever.
- Ever!

28:30.605 --> 28:36.142
Let's take a walk with it then.

28:38.879 --> 28:40.146
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:40.148 --> 28:41.581
Nice Volvo.

28:41.583 --> 28:43.416
Thanks. I just got it.

28:43.418 --> 28:46.419
Volvos are the safest
cars in the world,

28:46.421 --> 28:47.787
and they last forever.

28:47.789 --> 28:49.555
- Yeah.
- No nascar getup tonight?

28:49.557 --> 28:51.591
Nascar?
Why?

28:51.593 --> 28:54.594
Uh, yeah, I was gonna
wear it tonight,

28:54.596 --> 28:56.395
but, uh, the drycleaner has it.

28:56.397 --> 29:02.235
What you were thinking,
so I made reservations

29:02.237 --> 29:03.903
for 7:00
near 1st and hope.

29:03.905 --> 29:06.405
- It's near the music hall.
- Yeah, sure.

29:06.407 --> 29:10.343
But smokey Joe Jefferson is
playing at the fedora tonight,

29:10.345 --> 29:11.644
so I got us tickets.

29:11.646 --> 29:13.880
- That sounds great.
- Great.

29:13.882 --> 29:15.848
The music hall is on
grand and figueroa.

29:15.850 --> 29:17.483
And I checked traffic.
The 101 is closed

29:17.485 --> 29:18.851
between Barham and highland,

29:18.853 --> 29:23.823
to the 110 north and
then get off on figueroa

29:23.825 --> 29:26.759
put on your seatbelt.

29:26.761 --> 29:30.296
So after I graduated from
penn, I traveled everywhere.

29:30.298 --> 29:32.798
Started with southeast
Asia, went to Thailand,

29:32.800 --> 29:35.701
I even lived in India for a month

29:35.703 --> 29:39.539
Oh, I love that movie.

29:39.541 --> 29:41.274
Sean Connery--

29:41.276 --> 29:44.710
Sean Connery is great in it.

29:44.712 --> 29:47.380
So then after I volunteered

29:47.382 --> 29:49.482
as an aids relief
worker in the Sudan,

29:49.484 --> 29:51.417
I just felt like I needed
to use my finance degree

29:51.419 --> 29:52.451
to help people
in third-world countries

29:52.453 --> 29:56.722
So that's how I started
working for the IDRF.

29:56.724 --> 29:59.492
- Wow.
- And what about you, Avi?

29:59.494 --> 30:01.260
What's it like to be a doctor?

30:01.262 --> 30:05.731
Oh, uh, well...

30:05.733 --> 30:07.466
Yeah, the hours are crazy,

30:07.468 --> 30:10.703
and I'm on call 24/7
for emergencies.

30:10.705 --> 30:13.472
And unfortunately, I have to deal

30:13.474 --> 30:16.509
with a lot of crap.

30:16.511 --> 30:18.277
But at the end of the day,

30:18.279 --> 30:20.580
like you, I love helping people

30:20.582 --> 30:22.348
when their plumbing gets backed up.

30:25.386 --> 30:26.986
<i>Bonjour.</i>

30:26.988 --> 30:30.923
I will be your server this evening.

30:30.925 --> 30:33.893
Uh, yes, Claude, I'm feeling
a bit of a draft here.

30:33.895 --> 30:36.495
Do you mind if we move
to another table?

30:36.497 --> 30:38.664
Hm.

30:38.666 --> 30:42.268
Ooh.

30:45.772 --> 30:48.975
Claude, would you mind
turning down the loud music?

30:48.977 --> 30:51.310
And turning up the lights?

30:51.312 --> 30:52.812
It's so dark in here,
I don't think I'd be able

30:52.814 --> 30:56.415
It would be my pleasure, sir.

30:56.417 --> 30:59.652
But in the meantime, let me
tell you about our specials.

30:59.654 --> 31:02.722
For appetizer, we have
a scrumptious salad

31:02.724 --> 31:05.291
with gorgonzola, candied
walnuts, pears,

31:05.293 --> 31:08.261
Cranberries, and a honey
dijon vinaigrette.

31:08.263 --> 31:10.730
To die for.

31:10.732 --> 31:14.967
Would it be possible to
change that appetizer salad

31:14.969 --> 31:19.872
And could you substitute
feta for gorgonzola,

31:19.874 --> 31:23.709
pecans instead of walnuts,
apples instead of pears,

31:23.711 --> 31:26.379
and Cranberries instead of raisins?

31:26.381 --> 31:32.385
And the honey dijon
vinaigrette--

31:32.387 --> 31:33.586
can you put it on the side, please?

31:33.588 --> 31:35.354
Anything else, sir?

31:35.356 --> 31:37.523
Yes, and I hope this
isn't too much trouble,

31:37.525 --> 31:41.861
but would you mind throwing
a little salmon in there?

31:41.863 --> 31:45.064
- And for madame?
- That sounds great, Avi.

31:45.066 --> 31:47.767
I'll have the same thing.

31:47.769 --> 31:50.636
Of course.

31:50.638 --> 31:52.738
Thanks, mensch.

31:52.740 --> 31:56.475
So did you always
want to be a doctor?

31:56.477 --> 31:59.679
You know, I mean, being Jewish,

31:59.681 --> 32:03.716
Become a doctor, become a lawyer.

32:03.718 --> 32:06.319
Become a banker and
manipulate the economy.

32:06.321 --> 32:08.487
Go into publishing,
manipulate the media.

32:08.489 --> 32:11.857
God, you are too much.

32:11.859 --> 32:16.028
You're so cute.
Turn your head for a second.

32:16.030 --> 32:17.997
- Did you get a nose job?
- No.

32:17.999 --> 32:20.866
Are you kidding me?
That's your real nose?

32:20.868 --> 32:23.502
That's the hottest
little Jew beak ever.

32:25.906 --> 32:28.908
And for mademoiselle.

32:28.910 --> 32:32.378
Mmm. That looks good.

32:33.947 --> 32:36.716
And for monsieur.

32:36.718 --> 32:38.884
Thank you, Claude.

32:38.886 --> 32:41.754
This looks really good.

32:41.756 --> 32:43.489
Mmm.

32:43.491 --> 32:46.058
Oh.

32:46.060 --> 32:47.593
No.

32:47.595 --> 32:48.794
Oh, I got--
I'm--I'm sorry.

32:48.796 --> 32:52.431
No, no, no.
Here you go.

32:52.433 --> 32:56.902
Thanks, mensch.

32:56.904 --> 32:59.538
And did they turn up the
heat in here or what?

32:59.540 --> 33:02.908
I am starting to schvitz.

33:02.910 --> 33:07.380
Yeah, we should probably go
if we're gonna make it on time.

33:07.382 --> 33:08.981
Oh, yeah, I can't wait.

33:08.983 --> 33:10.883
Let me take a look
at this check here.

33:10.885 --> 33:13.586
Oh.
Okay, well,

33:13.588 --> 33:15.554
let me just get Claude
over here for a second,

33:15.556 --> 33:18.824
see if I can't Jew him
down on the check.

33:29.003 --> 33:31.103
Hey, are you all right?

33:31.105 --> 33:32.772
You seem a little, you know, quiet.

33:32.774 --> 33:35.741
- No, I'm fine.
- Yeah?

33:37.744 --> 33:39.044
You know, Alison, I, um...

33:39.046 --> 33:41.781
I mean, I shouldn't even
be saying this--

33:41.783 --> 33:44.617
it's our first date, but...

33:44.619 --> 33:46.919
I really like you.

33:46.921 --> 33:50.756
You know, so if I seem weird
or awkward or--

33:50.758 --> 33:54.693
that's why.
I just--I just hope

33:54.695 --> 33:57.830
that this is the first
date of many more to come.

34:04.906 --> 34:06.872
Oh, damn.

34:06.874 --> 34:10.810
Nobody plays jazz better
than the <i>shvartzes!</i>

34:13.481 --> 34:15.080
<i>L'Chaim!</i>

34:23.123 --> 34:24.757
Okay...

34:25.860 --> 34:28.661
Aah! Uhh!
Come on.

34:28.663 --> 34:30.963
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

34:30.965 --> 34:33.899
What's taking so long?

34:33.900 --> 34:35.534
Sorry, sorry.

34:35.536 --> 34:38.603
- I am all manscaped.
- Mm.

34:38.606 --> 34:41.239
Trimmed to 1/8 of an inch,
just how you like it.

34:41.242 --> 34:43.842
Like a prepubescent boy down there.

34:43.844 --> 34:48.514
It's so exciting.
Oh... Okay...

34:48.516 --> 34:50.783
Love you.
Good night.

34:52.820 --> 34:56.054
Are we gonna try and make a baby?

34:56.056 --> 34:58.757
It's just I've had such
a long day at work,

34:58.759 --> 35:01.060
and do you mind if
we just, you know,

35:01.062 --> 35:02.595
skip the baby-making?

35:02.597 --> 35:05.898
It's my most fertile
time of the month.

35:05.900 --> 35:07.933
- Okay...
- Now make me a baby.

35:07.935 --> 35:10.903
Right. Guess I could find
some energy.

35:10.905 --> 35:12.872
Ooh.

35:12.874 --> 35:14.240
Why aren't you hard?
What?

35:14.242 --> 35:16.041
It was, like, three seconds.

35:16.043 --> 35:18.110
- Do you want my hair down?
- No, babe, it's not--

35:18.112 --> 35:21.547
it's not you, it's me.
It's <i>him!</i>

35:21.549 --> 35:24.183
I mean, we had sex last
night and this morning

35:24.185 --> 35:26.018
and on your lunch break.

35:26.020 --> 35:27.653
I can't believe I'm gonna say this

35:27.655 --> 35:31.924
but I think that I'm sexed out.

35:31.926 --> 35:34.660
What? What?

35:35.929 --> 35:37.663
You think it's ugly.

35:37.665 --> 35:38.998
I--I think what's ugly?

35:39.000 --> 35:41.267
It's okay.
It's fine.

35:41.269 --> 35:43.769
I see 100 of 'em a day.
I know it's ugly.

35:43.771 --> 35:46.906
Oh, no, no, I think--
no, I don't think

35:46.908 --> 35:48.774
that it's ugly at all.

35:48.776 --> 35:52.611
I think it's beautiful.

35:52.613 --> 35:54.713
Then why don't you
ever go down on me?

35:54.715 --> 35:58.918
Because I--I can't get
you pregnant like that.

35:58.920 --> 36:00.319
Oh, now you're just making excuses!

36:00.321 --> 36:02.021
I am not.
Okay, fine.

36:02.023 --> 36:03.155
You want me to go down on you?

36:03.157 --> 36:05.925
- I'm happy to go down on you.
- Good.

36:05.927 --> 36:07.593
It's part of my manly duty.

36:07.595 --> 36:12.031
Mmm, yummy! I want it.

36:12.033 --> 36:13.666
- Here we go!
- Go!

36:13.668 --> 36:16.936
- It's gonna happen
- Come on.

36:16.938 --> 36:18.304
- Oh, my God!
- What?

36:18.306 --> 36:20.005
- I knew it!
- What's wrong?

36:20.007 --> 36:23.742
I was gonna make a
baby with my mouth.

36:23.744 --> 36:26.712
- Oh!
- What happened?

36:26.714 --> 36:29.248
You turned off the light!

36:29.250 --> 36:32.151
I--well, it was bright in here.

36:32.153 --> 36:33.986
And we were going to bed.

36:33.988 --> 36:35.821
Aw, come on.
I'm sorry.

36:35.823 --> 36:39.725
Oh, leave me and my
ugly vagina alone!

36:39.727 --> 36:41.760
Open the door.

36:41.762 --> 36:43.963
Honey...

36:43.965 --> 36:47.299
Oh, my God... It's ugly.

36:47.301 --> 36:49.868
It's not your vagina.

36:49.870 --> 36:51.770
It's <i>all</i> vaginas.

36:51.772 --> 36:55.774
What side of the
family is this from?

36:55.776 --> 36:57.610
Hey, you've reached Alison Marks.

36:57.612 --> 36:59.311
You know what to do, so do it.

36:59.313 --> 37:01.981
Hey, Alison, it's Avi here.

37:01.983 --> 37:03.315
Just wanted to tell you
I had a great time

37:03.317 --> 37:04.783
with you last night,

37:04.785 --> 37:06.752
and I can't wait to do it again.

37:06.754 --> 37:09.355
So... You got the number.

37:09.357 --> 37:12.625
Call me.
Bye.

37:14.829 --> 37:17.229
You know what to do. Do it.

37:17.231 --> 37:19.331
Hey, Alison,

37:19.333 --> 37:21.934
where's my jap at?
Where's my jap?

37:21.936 --> 37:23.769
Avi here.

37:23.771 --> 37:25.771
Didn't hear back
from you yesterday.

37:25.773 --> 37:27.673
But I'm sure you were just busy.

37:27.675 --> 37:31.310
Me too. Long day of surgery
at the hospital.

37:31.312 --> 37:33.212
So driving home now.

37:33.214 --> 37:36.115
Thought I'd double
up, give you a call.

37:36.117 --> 37:39.952
So you got the number.
Call me back.

37:39.954 --> 37:41.687
Buh-bye.

37:43.857 --> 37:45.758
You know what to do, so do it.

37:45.760 --> 37:49.028
Hey, Alison, it's Avi.

37:49.030 --> 37:51.430
I don't know why you're
not calling me back.

37:51.432 --> 37:53.932
I thought we had a really
great time the other night.

37:53.934 --> 37:58.871
And, you know, I thought
we had a real connection.

37:58.873 --> 38:00.806
- Boss! Boss!
- I was hoping that we--

38:00.808 --> 38:04.443
Me and Juan have been
at Mrs. Wazinsky's all day!

38:04.445 --> 38:06.445
Boss, we can't get the
shit out of her pipes!

38:06.447 --> 38:08.313
Yes. <i>Si.</i>

38:08.315 --> 38:09.982
Thank you, doctors Juan and Ramone.

38:09.984 --> 38:12.885
I will be to surgery
in just a second.

38:12.887 --> 38:18.791
Backed up in my life!

38:18.793 --> 38:21.760
- Avi?
- Alison, hi.

38:21.762 --> 38:24.029
Do you <i>want</i> me to get
a restraining order?

38:24.031 --> 38:27.132
Stop calling me.

38:29.002 --> 38:33.739
Oh... Look at this one.

38:33.741 --> 38:35.274
Isn't it beautiful?

38:35.276 --> 38:38.077
Oh, God!
A little warning, please?

38:38.079 --> 38:39.945
What is that, a before
and after photo?

38:39.947 --> 38:42.715
- Yes. Isn't it amazing?
- No.

38:42.717 --> 38:44.016
It's hard to believe
it's the same vagina.

38:44.018 --> 38:48.053
Which one's your favorite?

38:48.055 --> 38:49.855
I don't know.

38:49.857 --> 38:54.493
- So come on, pick.
- Ooh, yeah.

38:54.495 --> 38:55.894
Do you like this one?

38:55.896 --> 38:59.364
Um... Maybe the, uh...

38:59.366 --> 39:01.934
"Pearblossom"?

39:01.936 --> 39:05.370
Or the... "Gentle tulip."

39:05.372 --> 39:09.441
- You like the <i>pearblossom?</i>
<i>- Mm-Hmm.</i>

39:09.443 --> 39:12.010
Well, that's the cheapest one.

39:12.012 --> 39:13.312
There's nothing to it.

39:13.314 --> 39:16.448
Oh, hold on.

39:16.450 --> 39:20.052
Hello?
All right, relax, relax.

39:20.054 --> 39:22.121
What's going on?

39:22.123 --> 39:24.123
No, I can't meet you right now.

39:24.125 --> 39:28.060
I'm--I'm in the middle
of something.

39:28.062 --> 39:30.996
Relax and--

39:30.998 --> 39:33.232
you know what?
Yes, I can. Yes, I can.

39:33.234 --> 39:35.134
Okay, I'll meet you in 20 minutes.

39:35.136 --> 39:38.370
All right, babe. I'm so sorry.
I--I have to go.

39:38.372 --> 39:39.772
What do you mean you have to <i>go?</i>

39:39.774 --> 39:43.242
- And I gotta go meet him.
- Who? What friend?

39:43.244 --> 39:45.010
He's a friend from grade
school--I gotta go.

39:45.012 --> 39:46.512
- You can't leave.
- Why can't I leave?

39:46.514 --> 39:48.180
I don't know which one to get!

39:48.182 --> 39:49.848
Just get one of 'em! Right?

39:49.850 --> 39:51.416
I mean, like, it's not
that big of a deal.

39:51.418 --> 39:53.786
It's a big deal.
This is for you.

39:53.788 --> 39:55.254
I understand.
It's not that hard.

39:55.256 --> 39:57.456
Just go through it.
The "gentle tulip."

39:57.458 --> 40:00.559
"Calla Lily Breeze."
"LA petite canyon."

40:00.561 --> 40:02.795
Ooh, stay away
from "Venus flytrap."

40:02.797 --> 40:04.963
That looks like a--
like a limp starfish,

40:04.965 --> 40:06.331
and I don't want to
be looking at that

40:06.333 --> 40:08.200
when I'm doing wonderful
things to it.

40:08.202 --> 40:11.570
Okay.
Pick whatever you want.

40:11.572 --> 40:13.906
Any price.
Kisses.

40:13.908 --> 40:18.043
Oh... Looks like my mom's.

40:19.379 --> 40:22.047
Wait, wait, wait, she said,
"stop calling me?"

40:22.049 --> 40:24.883
I'm gonna get
a restraining order."

40:24.885 --> 40:26.051
It takes a special kind of woman

40:26.053 --> 40:28.020
to dance naked at 10:00 A.M.

40:28.022 --> 40:30.088
Give it up for crystal.

40:30.090 --> 40:32.858
Did you complain
there was a draft and ask--

40:32.860 --> 40:38.130
And you took something on the menu

40:38.132 --> 40:43.235
I put salmon on it.
I sent it back.

40:43.237 --> 40:46.972
Jewel, Carla...
Lap dances.

40:46.974 --> 40:49.374
I did everything that
you told me to do.

40:49.376 --> 40:55.180
My pupik was stuffed
from the noshing,

40:55.182 --> 40:58.851
Then I told smokey Joe
Jefferson nobody plays jazz

40:58.853 --> 41:00.385
- better than the Schvartzahs.
- What?

41:00.387 --> 41:02.154
You--you called him
a Sschvartzah?

41:02.156 --> 41:04.189
- Yeah, right to his face.
- No.

41:04.191 --> 41:06.124
- Wait, is that bad?
- Yeah, that's bad!

41:06.126 --> 41:08.126
- Why did you teach me that.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

41:08.128 --> 41:09.461
That's only
a Jew-to-Jew thing,

41:09.463 --> 41:14.933
that I'd ever met, and that she had

41:14.935 --> 41:16.935
the cutest little Jew
beak I'd ever seen.

41:16.937 --> 41:18.637
And I asked the waiter if I could

41:18.639 --> 41:20.405
Jew him down on the check.

41:20.407 --> 41:27.312
Yeah, but she knew that you
were joking--that's different.

41:27.314 --> 41:28.947
Jews don't talk to
each other like that?

41:28.949 --> 41:30.415
No! No! We don't!

41:30.417 --> 41:32.150
- Oh...
- It's over.

41:32.152 --> 41:37.389
- I'm out.
- You are in.

41:37.391 --> 41:38.590
- Oh...
- Oh, you are in.

41:38.592 --> 41:42.160
- Yes.
- Son of a bitch.

41:42.162 --> 41:45.564
Marcy Marks...
President of temple Beth Jacob

41:45.566 --> 41:49.167
wife of my rabbi, and
Alison's mother.

41:52.071 --> 41:54.239
She was also the principal
of my Hebrew school.

41:56.209 --> 41:58.343
From what I know, no man has ever

41:58.345 --> 42:00.178
been good enough for Alison.

42:00.180 --> 42:02.981
But if you can get that
woman's seal of approval,

42:02.983 --> 42:05.450
you might have a second chance.

42:05.452 --> 42:07.119
I'll never forget
that day I met her.

42:10.124 --> 42:12.324
Need some help?

42:14.427 --> 42:17.262
You touch my daughter,

42:17.264 --> 42:19.064
and I'll wear your
balls as earrings.

42:32.312 --> 42:35.013
- Boom!
- Ow.

43:22.763 --> 43:25.230
They've got to be kidding me.

43:25.232 --> 43:27.265
Schlomy and I don't stand a chance.

43:27.267 --> 43:30.369
- Yes, yes.
- Thanks.

43:30.371 --> 43:34.373
I'm telling you the
Fleischmans are unbeatable.

43:34.375 --> 43:36.475
Yes. Good-bye.

43:36.477 --> 43:40.012
Oh, honey, have you tried this
caramel apple skim cappuccino?

43:40.014 --> 43:43.115
It is to die for.

43:43.117 --> 43:45.784
Fleisch... Man.

43:45.786 --> 43:49.254
Caramel apple skim cappuccinos.

43:49.256 --> 43:52.391
Ah.

43:52.393 --> 43:56.128
The earthquake was all
the way in death valley.

43:56.130 --> 43:59.331
What do you mean I sound sick?
I'm not sick.

43:59.333 --> 44:00.565
What do you mean I sound sick?

44:00.567 --> 44:03.702
Yes, if you send me multivitamins,

44:03.704 --> 44:05.303
- I will take them.
- Good. Good.

44:05.305 --> 44:08.407
Every time we get off the
phone with each other,

44:08.409 --> 44:10.342
we have to say
"I love you."

44:10.344 --> 44:12.210
You're kidding.

44:12.212 --> 44:15.380
- I love you, mom.
- Perfect.

44:15.382 --> 44:19.284
Okay, bye.
Sorry, that was my mom.

44:19.286 --> 44:22.587
Dr. Avi Rosenberg,
may we please now continue

44:22.589 --> 44:26.091
- with the interview?
- Oh, yes, please.

44:26.093 --> 44:29.628
Because I was just
at handlebar coffee,

44:29.630 --> 44:31.363
and they screwed up my order.

44:31.365 --> 44:33.398
I like caramel apple cappuccino.

44:33.400 --> 44:35.700
They gave me a caramel
apple <i>skim</i> cappuccino.

44:35.702 --> 44:37.602
Hmm.
Sure, why not?

44:37.604 --> 44:39.404
Great.

44:39.406 --> 44:41.540
Okay, you are single, 31 years old,

44:41.542 --> 44:44.142
unmarried, no children.
Are you gay?

44:44.144 --> 44:47.412
Well, then why aren't you married?

44:47.414 --> 44:49.781
Oh, believe me, Mrs. Marks
there is nothing

44:49.783 --> 44:51.550
that I would like more than to find

44:51.552 --> 44:53.318
a special young lady

44:53.320 --> 44:56.221
who shares my values
and my beliefs.

44:56.223 --> 44:58.590
As a matter of fact,
just a couple weeks ago,

44:58.592 --> 45:02.194
I met a wonderful girl.
We went out.

45:02.196 --> 45:03.762
We had a wonderful first date.

45:03.764 --> 45:05.797
I never heard from her again.

45:05.799 --> 45:07.432
Yes, well, finding
that special someone

45:07.434 --> 45:09.701
is never easy, doctor.

45:09.703 --> 45:11.403
And especially for me.

45:11.405 --> 45:14.139
I just, you know, moved
here from Skokie,

45:14.141 --> 45:16.374
and I'm busy with my
practice, of course,

45:16.376 --> 45:19.845
And volunteering for Hadassah
like I do--

45:19.847 --> 45:22.581
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Yes, mom?

45:22.583 --> 45:25.484
- Colonoscopy.
- Yes, I had my colonoscopy.

45:25.486 --> 45:28.787
- Fiber.
- I do get plenty of fiber.

45:28.789 --> 45:32.224
Mom, I'm sorry but I
have to go, okay?

45:32.226 --> 45:35.260
I do. I love you.

45:35.262 --> 45:36.862
I love the way you wake
up in the morning,

45:36.864 --> 45:40.732
- And then the sunlight comes--
- Too much! Too much!

45:40.734 --> 45:42.868
Okay, I'm gonna hang up. Bye.

45:42.870 --> 45:47.272
I must say that I find
this very unusual.

45:47.274 --> 45:49.341
That a young, attractive,
single doctor

45:49.343 --> 45:51.343
would walk in here by himself

45:51.345 --> 45:53.245
wanting to join this temple.

45:53.247 --> 45:55.313
Now, why don't you tell me
what is really going on?

45:55.315 --> 45:57.649
Mrs. Marks, did you know
that in the last 20 years,

45:57.651 --> 45:59.684
the rate of inter-faith marriage
among our people

45:59.686 --> 46:01.486
has risen from 7% to 40%?

46:01.488 --> 46:03.622
According to the ajc,
by the year 2050,

46:03.624 --> 46:05.924
our people are gonna be
completely wiped out.

46:05.926 --> 46:07.859
Now, I'm just one man.
I can't stop it myself.

46:07.861 --> 46:10.162
But I'm not gonna sit
here on the sidelines

46:10.164 --> 46:13.331
and watch it happen.
That's what's going on.

46:19.940 --> 46:23.341
All right, I'll be right there.

46:26.813 --> 46:28.847
All right, all right.

46:28.849 --> 46:31.183
- So you're in.
- Oh, yeah, I'm in.

46:31.185 --> 46:32.651
She's putty.

46:32.653 --> 46:33.752
Still going down Saturday, right?

46:33.754 --> 46:36.354
You master duplicate bridge yet?

46:36.356 --> 46:38.557
And rubber.

46:38.559 --> 46:40.825
That shit reeks.
You guys really eat that?

46:40.827 --> 46:43.495
Gefilte fish is mandatory.

46:43.497 --> 46:44.863
All right, I'm gonna
put it in this drawer.

46:44.865 --> 46:47.599
Don't take it out till Saturday.

46:49.602 --> 46:51.836
Ugh.

46:51.838 --> 46:53.705
So good to see you.

46:53.707 --> 46:56.641
There's plenty of room over there.

46:56.643 --> 46:58.610
You guys, I want you
to keep eyes forward

46:58.612 --> 47:01.379
and pay attention.
Understand?

47:01.381 --> 47:03.648
- Marcy.
- Avi!

47:03.650 --> 47:06.351
What a nice surprise.

47:06.353 --> 47:07.552
Surprise?
I'm a new member here.

47:07.554 --> 47:13.658
- That's a beautiful purse.
- Arianne tunney.

47:13.660 --> 47:15.760
- Winter, 2012.
- Really?

47:15.762 --> 47:17.696
I coveted this bag, and I got it.

47:17.698 --> 47:20.732
There's something about this

47:20.734 --> 47:23.368
- that just--
- Wish me luck, lollypop.

47:23.370 --> 47:25.704
Honey, honey, you
are gonna need it.

47:25.706 --> 47:27.606
Oh, today we have a
double bar mitzvah.

47:27.608 --> 47:29.874
- Oy.
- This is our newest member

47:29.876 --> 47:30.909
I was telling you about, Avi.

47:30.911 --> 47:36.881
Has Marcy warned you about
our little penis club?

47:36.883 --> 47:39.451
Oh, no-- uh, penis club?

47:39.453 --> 47:42.420
18 years ago, a boy
named Adam Lipschitz

47:42.422 --> 47:44.422
had a panic attack during
his bar mitzvah...

47:44.424 --> 47:45.890
Dropped his trousers,

47:45.892 --> 47:48.994
and exposed himself
to the congregation.

47:48.996 --> 47:51.496
- That's messed up.
- Oh, it is messed up, Avi.

47:51.498 --> 47:53.965
What's even more messed
up is that to this day,

47:53.967 --> 47:56.635
Adam's lewd act has become
the rite of passage

47:56.637 --> 47:59.304
for every boy who's had his
bar mitzvah at our temple.

47:59.306 --> 48:03.508
In fact, there hasn't been a
bar mitzvah boy since 1993

48:03.510 --> 48:06.878
who hasn't shown his penis
to the entire congregation.

48:06.880 --> 48:08.980
I've tried everything.
They won't stop.

48:08.982 --> 48:13.418
I've seen the penises
of 459 young boys.

48:13.420 --> 48:15.654
So unless you're really
into schlongs, Avi,

48:15.656 --> 48:18.323
this ain't the temple for you.

48:18.325 --> 48:23.828
Avi, schlomy and I are
so embarrassed that,

48:23.830 --> 48:26.564
on your very first Saturday
morning service with us,

48:26.566 --> 48:29.401
you had to see... Genitals.

48:29.403 --> 48:32.570
And we sincerely hope that
the fact that our temple

48:32.572 --> 48:34.806
has a penis club won't
make you consider

48:34.808 --> 48:36.041
joining elsewhere.

48:36.043 --> 48:37.609
Not at all, not at all.

48:37.611 --> 48:38.910
What was the name of the young man

48:38.912 --> 48:40.011
who started it all?
Adam...

48:40.013 --> 48:41.646
Lipschitz.

48:41.648 --> 48:43.682
I hope I don't run into him.

48:43.684 --> 48:45.050
- Yes, don't we all.
- I've seen enough.

48:45.052 --> 48:49.321
Excuse me, rabbi, would
you like some fish?

48:49.323 --> 48:52.824
Oh, yes, thank you, uh, hyman.

48:56.362 --> 48:57.862
- Thank you.
- Mm-Hmm.

48:57.864 --> 49:00.965
Oy!
Wow.

49:00.967 --> 49:02.701
I have to say, our
people have invented

49:02.703 --> 49:04.836
a lot of lousy food,
but gefilte fish

49:04.838 --> 49:06.471
might be the worst.

49:09.343 --> 49:12.110
My advice is to get it over
with as quickly as possible.

49:12.112 --> 49:13.745
Two bites.

49:13.747 --> 49:16.114
Wham, bam... Done!

49:16.116 --> 49:18.616
Ah. Ahh!

49:22.489 --> 49:27.025
- Go away!
- Damn it, schlomo,

49:27.027 --> 49:29.494
- I am coming in there.
- No, you don't wanna see this!

49:29.496 --> 49:31.730
It'll change you.
It changed me.

49:31.732 --> 49:33.698
I'm shitting...

49:33.700 --> 49:35.867
Oh, Marcy, I hate to do
this to you, cupcake,

49:35.869 --> 49:38.069
but I think I'm gonna have to
bow out of the tournament.

49:38.071 --> 49:40.472
No! No!
No, no, no, schlomo.

49:40.474 --> 49:41.806
You are not doing any such thing.

49:41.808 --> 49:44.976
If we have to take some
sort of slop bucket,

49:44.978 --> 49:47.612
- then so be it.
- I'm sorry, lollypop.

49:47.614 --> 49:49.013
We'll just have to
wait another year

49:49.015 --> 49:51.149
to beat those damn Fleischmans.

49:51.151 --> 49:54.018
Darn it. What tournament?

49:54.020 --> 49:56.121
What tournament?

49:56.123 --> 49:58.156
It is the N.B.L.A. Regionals.

49:58.158 --> 50:00.392
We are in the finals.
It starts in three hours.

50:00.394 --> 50:02.026
- Oh.
- But... Well...

50:02.028 --> 50:05.597
I guess that I won't
be going this year.

50:05.599 --> 50:07.732
I play bridge.

50:07.734 --> 50:10.835
Dear God, all I do is help you!

50:10.837 --> 50:14.172
I want to thank all of
you for taking part

50:14.174 --> 50:20.812
in what is the world's

They're freaking me
out a little bit.

51:45.765 --> 51:48.666
I've been playing
with them for years.

51:48.668 --> 51:50.702
It's disturbing.

51:52.806 --> 51:54.939
Ooooh! Oh! Oh!

51:58.979 --> 52:00.812
- We can do this, right?

Trump, baby!
It's called trump!

52:07.187 --> 52:09.521
- It's called trump!
- I can't believe it.

52:09.523 --> 52:12.156
- You did it!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

52:14.127 --> 52:16.561
Oh, my God!
Finally!

52:16.563 --> 52:18.196
Who's the big winners over here?

52:18.198 --> 52:21.165
Who beat the Fleischmans?
I beat the Fleischmans.

52:21.167 --> 52:24.636
- We beat the Fleischmans.
- You!

52:24.638 --> 52:26.938
You did it!
You did it.

52:26.940 --> 52:28.873
Oh, you are amazing.
You are totally--

52:28.875 --> 52:31.109
we did it. <i>We</i> did it. Yeah.

52:31.111 --> 52:33.244
- Who wants an autograph?
- Oh, honey.

52:33.246 --> 52:36.915
Honey, did you see us?
Oh...

52:38.083 --> 52:40.952
- Alison.
- Avi. What are you doing here?

52:40.954 --> 52:42.587
Wait, you two know each other?

52:42.589 --> 52:44.923
This is the girl I told you about.

52:44.925 --> 52:47.659
She never called me back.

52:47.661 --> 52:48.760
How do you two know each other?

52:48.762 --> 52:50.662
That's my daughter.

52:50.664 --> 52:55.199
Can I talk to you
just for a second?

52:55.201 --> 52:59.037
Um, I--I met that guy
at your last mixer.

52:59.039 --> 53:01.172
We went on a date, and
he ended up being

53:01.174 --> 53:03.608
one of the strangest
guys I've ever met.

53:03.610 --> 53:06.644
How can you possibly say that?
I think he is wonderful.

53:06.646 --> 53:08.179
He asked our waiter if he could

53:08.181 --> 53:12.617
And then he said that I had
a cute little Jew-beak.

53:12.619 --> 53:15.253
Oh, I'm sure that
he was just joking.

53:15.255 --> 53:16.988
- He's very funny.
- Really?

53:16.990 --> 53:19.123
Okay, well, then we
went to a jazz club,

53:19.125 --> 53:20.925
and he stood up in
front of everyone

53:20.927 --> 53:23.861
and said that smokey Joe
Jefferson was a Sschvartzah.

53:23.863 --> 53:25.163
Well, he is one, isn't he?

53:25.165 --> 53:26.998
He is a psycho!

53:27.000 --> 53:28.600
I mean, isn't it obvious that
he's, like, stalking me?

53:28.602 --> 53:30.702
Oh, please.
Now come on.

53:30.704 --> 53:33.905
It's not like he has time to stalk.

53:33.907 --> 53:37.742
No, obviously this is some
sort of crazy coincidence

53:37.744 --> 53:39.644
that, you know, it's--

53:39.646 --> 53:41.646
now wait a minute.

53:41.648 --> 53:44.115
A--actually, I--I don't--

53:44.117 --> 53:47.919
I don't think that this
is a coincidence at all.

53:47.921 --> 53:51.689
No, I think that this
just might be fate

53:51.691 --> 53:54.359
trying to get you two together.

53:54.361 --> 53:56.194
Wow.

53:56.196 --> 53:59.664
All right, Alison,
darling, listen to me.

53:59.666 --> 54:02.400
You are 27 years old.

54:02.402 --> 54:04.369
And have I ever tried to
set you up with anyone?

54:04.371 --> 54:06.938
No! And why is that?

54:06.940 --> 54:10.008
Because I have never felt that
anyone was good enough for you.

54:10.010 --> 54:13.378
Until now.

54:13.380 --> 54:16.080
Mm, mm, mm.

54:21.354 --> 54:23.254
- What are you doing?
- What?

54:23.256 --> 54:25.223
I told you to let me
get to the altar,

54:25.225 --> 54:28.226
look at me for 15 seconds,
let the tension build,

54:28.228 --> 54:30.795
and then slowly pull my veil back.

54:30.797 --> 54:34.132
Can somebody get him
off the shitter?

54:34.134 --> 54:35.667
Okay, fine. Whatever.
Let's just keep going.

54:35.669 --> 54:38.870
We have to keep doing it
till we get it right.

54:38.872 --> 54:42.073
I clocked you pulling back
the veil after four seconds.

54:42.075 --> 54:43.675
Yeah, that's the least
of our problems.

54:43.677 --> 54:45.343
You didn't even have
tears in your eyes

54:45.345 --> 54:46.912
- when you lifted up the veil.
- It's a rehearsal!

54:46.913 --> 54:48.746
Who cares if it's a rehearsal?

54:48.748 --> 54:50.081
Don't you love my daughter
so much that you tear up

54:50.083 --> 54:51.849
every time you see her?

54:51.851 --> 54:53.084
I can't believe you're
being so insensitive.

54:53.086 --> 54:56.821
That she is still recovering
from her surgery?

54:56.823 --> 54:58.956
Oh, by the way, Hannah,
how's your new vag?

54:58.958 --> 55:01.192
Jill! Stop talking
about Hannah's vagina.

55:01.194 --> 55:02.760
Less ugly?

55:02.762 --> 55:03.961
- Dennis!
- Dad!

55:03.963 --> 55:05.463
- What?
- Pookie-poo?

55:05.465 --> 55:07.265
The Daniels are right.

55:07.267 --> 55:10.435
Because we only have three
more rehearsals left

55:10.437 --> 55:14.105
Megan, sweetie, your
pedal throwing's got

55:14.107 --> 55:18.910
Remember, it's three
petals per step.

55:18.912 --> 55:20.179
Screw it up again and
you're both out.

55:22.282 --> 55:24.849
Okay, so let's take
it from the poems.

55:24.851 --> 55:26.451
What?
The poems?

55:26.453 --> 55:27.919
- Yeah.
- Oh, honey.

55:27.921 --> 55:33.891
But I need to see your performance

55:33.893 --> 55:36.027
so I can give you notes.

55:36.029 --> 55:39.063
Okay!

55:39.065 --> 55:40.765
- "Hannah."
- Yes.

55:40.767 --> 55:43.000
"The day I met you
it was like a dream,

55:43.002 --> 55:46.337
"even more thrilling than my
father's new embroidery machine.

55:46.339 --> 55:48.873
- Fine.
- Fine.

55:48.875 --> 55:50.274
"My feelings toward
you are so extreme

55:50.276 --> 55:52.043
"that sometimes when I'm with you

55:52.045 --> 55:53.911
"I just--
I just wanna s--

55:55.849 --> 55:57.482
- Scream."
- What grade is he in?

55:57.484 --> 55:59.117
"The thought of being without you

55:59.119 --> 56:01.419
"words can't explain.

56:01.421 --> 56:03.921
"If you only knew what
was going on inside...

56:03.923 --> 56:06.958
My br--"

56:06.960 --> 56:08.459
- Ah!
- Brain. Brain!

56:08.461 --> 56:10.461
"Brain.

56:10.463 --> 56:11.896
"I can't believe I'm about to spend

56:11.898 --> 56:13.197
the rest
of my years with you."

56:13.199 --> 56:14.999
Good.

56:15.001 --> 56:17.268
"And in just a few minutes...

56:17.270 --> 56:19.537
"I'm going to say the words...

56:19.539 --> 56:23.074
"'I--

56:24.476 --> 56:25.910
"'I--

56:27.280 --> 56:30.014
I--I'm gonna say the words
'I--"

56:31.851 --> 56:34.418
What are you doing?

56:34.420 --> 56:36.487
I'm not ready to be a man.

56:36.489 --> 56:37.955
- What?
- Again?

56:37.957 --> 56:39.490
I'm not ready to be a man.

56:39.492 --> 56:43.261
- What!
- I'm not ready to be a man!

56:43.263 --> 56:46.531
I'm not ready to be a man!

56:46.533 --> 56:48.399
- Adam!
- I'm not ready to be a man!

56:48.401 --> 56:50.401
Adam!

56:50.403 --> 56:52.170
This is why I wanted to rehearse!

56:52.172 --> 56:53.838
What the fuck!

56:58.044 --> 57:00.211
I can't believe I was
so wrong about you.

57:00.213 --> 57:02.480
Why does my mother have to
be right about everything?

57:02.482 --> 57:06.317
You know mothers.

57:06.319 --> 57:08.586
Mm.

57:08.588 --> 57:12.456
What does it look like I'm doing?

57:12.458 --> 57:14.559
No, no.
I think we should--

57:14.561 --> 57:16.227
I think we should take it slow.

57:16.229 --> 57:17.862
You're kidding, right?

57:17.864 --> 57:20.231
No, no, because, um...

57:20.233 --> 57:22.433
Sex, you know, has a way
of complicating things,

57:22.435 --> 57:25.236
and I wanna get to know you.

57:25.238 --> 57:27.004
I wanna get to know the real you.

57:27.006 --> 57:30.875
I've never met a guy
who wanted to wait.

57:30.877 --> 57:33.477
That is so... Hot.

57:33.479 --> 57:35.079
Oh, shit.

57:36.549 --> 57:40.251
That's my phone.

57:40.253 --> 57:41.552
Hold on, hold on.

57:41.554 --> 57:45.022
What are you do--
what are you doing, man?

57:45.024 --> 57:46.257
I've been calling you all week.

57:46.259 --> 57:48.125
I haven't even heard from you.

57:48.127 --> 57:50.328
What's the mat--
wait, wait, wait.

57:50.330 --> 57:52.430
Hannah?

57:52.432 --> 57:55.867
Who's Hannah?

57:55.869 --> 57:57.869
So then I saw your commercial.

57:57.871 --> 57:59.437
So I went to the palace

57:59.439 --> 58:01.138
and we've been hanging
out ever since.

58:01.140 --> 58:02.907
He never said a word
to us about this.

58:02.909 --> 58:04.609
God forbid he should
tell us anything.

58:04.611 --> 58:06.310
Have you heard from him
at all in the last week?

58:06.312 --> 58:08.112
No, no.
I've been calling him too.

58:08.114 --> 58:09.380
He hasn't returned any of my calls.

58:09.382 --> 58:12.116
What if he was raped and murdered

58:12.118 --> 58:16.654
Did he say anything about
Hannah, about the wedding?

58:16.656 --> 58:18.289
No, nothing. I--I--

58:18.291 --> 58:19.590
- daddy!
- You know what?

58:19.592 --> 58:23.361
I disappeared for six months
before my wedding, right, honey?

58:23.363 --> 58:25.196
Uh, that was me.

58:25.198 --> 58:26.597
That's right, it was--

58:26.599 --> 58:28.199
how are you a doctor?

58:28.201 --> 58:30.034
Oh, my God!

58:30.036 --> 58:34.138
He's gone forever, and I'm
never gonna have a baby!

58:35.374 --> 58:38.142
Oh, God!

58:38.144 --> 58:40.344
I'm never gonna have a grandchild.

58:44.918 --> 58:48.319
God damn it, do something, Bruce!

58:52.558 --> 58:56.260
No!

59:03.635 --> 59:05.703
- I'm not ready to be a man.
- Hello?

59:05.705 --> 59:09.240
- I'm not ready to be a man.
- Adam?

59:11.177 --> 59:13.577
Now the doctors at the hospital

59:13.579 --> 59:15.346
referred you to serenity hills

59:15.348 --> 59:18.115
because they felt
that Adam required

59:18.117 --> 59:21.619
a more intense, hands-on
environment for his condition.

59:21.621 --> 59:23.254
His condition?

59:23.256 --> 59:25.456
Oh, Adam is suffering
from a severe case

59:25.458 --> 59:27.158
of post traumatic stress disorder.

59:27.160 --> 59:28.559
Oh.

59:28.561 --> 59:30.361
- What the--
- I didn't do it.

59:30.363 --> 59:31.629
I just don't understand

59:31.631 --> 59:35.032
- Not again.
- And your fault.

59:35.034 --> 59:37.601
Honey, you can still
change your mind.

59:40.340 --> 59:42.006
What the--

59:42.008 --> 59:44.275
Seems fine to me.

59:44.277 --> 59:45.676
- Get him!
- Pookie!

59:45.678 --> 59:47.011
Run! Get him!

59:47.013 --> 59:49.146
Get back here!

59:49.148 --> 59:52.650
In case like Adam's, who has
a long history of panic attacks,

59:52.652 --> 59:59.457
what we refer to as the "ha,"
or the hyperaroused state.

01:00:01.327 --> 01:00:02.760
Oh.

01:00:02.762 --> 01:00:07.465
Is Adam attempting to isolate
and detach from his feelings,

01:00:07.467 --> 01:00:11.602
thus creating what we call
emotional detachment,

01:00:11.604 --> 01:00:15.272
or numb nuts--
numbness--numbing.

01:00:15.274 --> 01:00:16.507
Sorry.

01:00:16.509 --> 01:00:19.143
Now, over the next 21 days,

01:00:19.145 --> 01:00:20.511
we are going to be implementing

01:00:20.513 --> 01:00:23.514
a series of therapies
and treatments.

01:00:23.516 --> 01:00:25.282
21 days. No, no, no.
That is July 2nd.

01:00:25.284 --> 01:00:27.051
July 2nd my wedding.

01:00:27.053 --> 01:00:28.285
We gotta get him outta
here quicker than that.

01:00:28.287 --> 01:00:31.122
Do you have, like,
an express service?

01:00:31.124 --> 01:00:34.258
This is our only son
you're talking about.

01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:37.128
We're not putting him on
some express service!

01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:38.496
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Ugh!

01:00:40.033 --> 01:00:43.501
We need 21 days, and if
you cannot give us that,

01:00:43.503 --> 01:00:45.669
- then get him outta here!
- No!

01:00:45.671 --> 01:00:47.371
We could go swimming.
I don't know.

01:00:47.373 --> 01:00:48.706
No, you don't need to cry.

01:00:48.708 --> 01:00:50.141
It's gonna be okay.

01:00:50.143 --> 01:00:55.813
Is it just me or does that
dolphin look like Hannah?

01:00:55.815 --> 01:00:58.082
He never did that with me, ever!

01:01:01.387 --> 01:01:04.221
- Fuck you, Adam!
- Fuck you!

01:01:04.223 --> 01:01:08.592
Johnny Williams, come on down!

01:01:08.594 --> 01:01:12.329
Oh, gosh, I don't think I've
seen this since I was a kid.

01:01:12.331 --> 01:01:14.065
Wow.

01:01:14.067 --> 01:01:16.100
It's amazing they can
still find humans

01:01:16.102 --> 01:01:19.136
who will actually
appear on this show.

01:01:19.138 --> 01:01:20.671
I'm Sala Khan.

01:01:20.673 --> 01:01:25.443
I've been assigned to be
your primary counselor.

01:01:25.445 --> 01:01:28.779
Look, if you don't wanna
talk, it's no problem.

01:01:28.781 --> 01:01:30.448
You don't have to talk.

01:01:30.450 --> 01:01:33.084
These things take time.

01:01:33.086 --> 01:01:35.352
And I've got all the time you need.

01:01:36.755 --> 01:01:39.490
All right, are you
ready for some paco?

01:01:39.492 --> 01:01:41.459
- Okay, let's do it.
- Let's walk out.

01:01:41.461 --> 01:01:44.395
And give it a drop.

01:01:44.397 --> 01:01:47.131
Okay, all right.
Here it goes.

01:01:47.133 --> 01:01:49.233
A little tea time.

01:01:49.235 --> 01:01:54.138
Why is that only fat people
make it into the showdown?

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:56.173
Fine.

01:01:56.175 --> 01:01:58.175
You know, you wanna sit there
like a vegetable all day

01:01:58.177 --> 01:01:59.710
and pretend like you don't hear me,

01:01:59.712 --> 01:02:01.745
then go right ahead.

01:02:01.747 --> 01:02:04.815
But my job is to
make you well again

01:02:04.817 --> 01:02:06.617
by having you face
the traumatic events

01:02:06.619 --> 01:02:08.619
that have forced you
into this state.

01:02:08.621 --> 01:02:11.589
So... Unless you're willing
to turn off the TV and do that,

01:02:11.591 --> 01:02:14.291
then I would save the 2,500
a day you're spending here

01:02:14.293 --> 01:02:16.160
and go check yourself into a hotel.

01:02:18.764 --> 01:02:20.731
Suit yourself.

01:02:20.733 --> 01:02:24.535
You stare all you like, little man.

01:02:28.173 --> 01:02:31.542
What did you just say?

01:02:31.544 --> 01:02:34.912
Mm, so anyway, the moyil slips,

01:02:34.914 --> 01:02:37.348
a piece falls off,
hits me in the punim.

01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:39.483
I been cockeyed ever since.

01:02:42.421 --> 01:02:44.421
So, Avi, Alison tells
me you're from Skokie.

01:02:44.423 --> 01:02:45.923
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:45.925 --> 01:02:47.491
You know, Al and I
grew up in Glenview.

01:02:47.493 --> 01:02:49.660
Sorry.

01:02:49.662 --> 01:02:51.595
Excuse me.
Oh, really?

01:02:51.597 --> 01:02:53.264
Yeah, we were
practically neighbors.

01:02:53.266 --> 01:02:55.466
- Your family still there?
- Nope.

01:02:55.468 --> 01:02:58.302
- Where'd they move to?
- They moved...

01:02:58.304 --> 01:02:59.537
To heaven.

01:02:59.539 --> 01:03:02.673
Oh... I'm so sorry.

01:03:02.675 --> 01:03:06.477
- When did they pass?
- They, um--

01:03:06.479 --> 01:03:08.312
they passed a few years back.

01:03:08.314 --> 01:03:09.680
Can't believe you
never told me that.

01:03:09.682 --> 01:03:11.649
Well, it's hard to talk about it.

01:03:11.651 --> 01:03:13.450
It's very raw.

01:03:13.452 --> 01:03:15.486
- Why, what happened?
- Hunting accident.

01:03:15.488 --> 01:03:17.321
- Oy!
- Hunting accident?

01:03:17.323 --> 01:03:18.956
- Your par--
- They got shot by hunters.

01:03:18.958 --> 01:03:20.758
What were your parents
doing wandering around

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.493
where people were hunting?

01:03:22.495 --> 01:03:25.563
The hunters were hunting
in our backyard.

01:03:25.565 --> 01:03:28.199
What were the hunters
doing in your backyard?

01:03:28.201 --> 01:03:31.235
They had gotten lost
and, uh, were off track.

01:03:31.237 --> 01:03:33.871
And, uh, my parents were
wearing their brown onesies

01:03:33.873 --> 01:03:36.207
and the--

01:03:36.209 --> 01:03:38.609
The, um--the hunters
mistook them for elk.

01:03:38.611 --> 01:03:39.977
- Elk.
- What happened to the hunters?

01:03:39.979 --> 01:03:42.546
- Were they arrested?
- No.

01:03:42.548 --> 01:03:44.582
- They are still at large.
- You know what, Avi?

01:03:44.584 --> 01:03:46.817
The police in Skokie's
an old friend of mine.

01:03:46.819 --> 01:03:48.552
I'm calling him tomorrow.

01:03:48.554 --> 01:03:49.853
We'll see if we can't
help move things along.

01:03:49.855 --> 01:03:51.655
Huh.

01:03:51.657 --> 01:03:53.691
Forgive me, but weren't you
on the phone with your--

01:03:53.693 --> 01:03:55.960
can we--can we talk
about something else?

01:03:55.962 --> 01:03:58.596
- Of course.
- I was watching TV last night.

01:03:58.598 --> 01:04:01.865
Charleton heston.
What an actor.

01:04:01.867 --> 01:04:03.701
Not Jewish, you know.

01:04:03.703 --> 01:04:05.669
Who isn't?

01:04:05.671 --> 01:04:10.341
So I'm--I'm up there
and we're rehearsing these--

01:04:10.343 --> 01:04:14.478
these poems that we had
written for each other.

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:19.550
And--and right at the part
where I'm about to say "I do"

01:04:19.552 --> 01:04:21.418
I just--I just cracked.

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:23.020
Good, Adam.

01:04:23.022 --> 01:04:24.755
Do you remember how
you were feeling

01:04:24.757 --> 01:04:26.023
in that very moment?

01:04:26.025 --> 01:04:29.760
No.
I mean, I--I just--

01:04:29.762 --> 01:04:33.697
for a split second, I saw
my entire life with Hannah

01:04:33.699 --> 01:04:35.666
flash before my eyes.

01:04:35.668 --> 01:04:37.434
And why did that scare you?

01:04:37.436 --> 01:04:40.971
Probably because I--

01:04:40.973 --> 01:04:42.673
I don't think she's right for me.

01:04:42.675 --> 01:04:44.575
So then why are you marrying her?

01:04:44.577 --> 01:04:48.545
You're avoiding the question, Adam.

01:04:48.547 --> 01:04:50.381
I think you do know.

01:04:50.383 --> 01:04:52.016
Now what I want you to do

01:04:52.018 --> 01:04:54.952
is try to pinpoint the
exact moment in your life

01:04:54.954 --> 01:04:58.689
where this pressure you're
feeling originated.

01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:04.795
I was 12 years old.

01:05:04.797 --> 01:05:09.366
Stop staring at her, Adam.
That is rude!

01:05:09.368 --> 01:05:10.768
You cute.

01:05:10.770 --> 01:05:14.371
You stare all you like, little man.

01:05:14.373 --> 01:05:15.939
You are not, and you will never be,

01:05:15.941 --> 01:05:17.875
her little man.

01:05:17.877 --> 01:05:19.977
- Why can't I be her little man?
- Because she's not Jewish.

01:05:19.979 --> 01:05:21.845
So I can't be with a
girl who's not Jewish?

01:05:21.847 --> 01:05:23.580
- That's right.
- Why?

01:05:23.582 --> 01:05:29.053
- And we owe it to them.
- Why?

01:05:29.055 --> 01:05:31.789
So what does that
have to do with me?

01:05:31.791 --> 01:05:35.559
The fate of our entire
religion depends on you!

01:05:37.530 --> 01:05:38.929
It depends on me!

01:05:38.931 --> 01:05:40.431
It depends on me!
It's all right.

01:05:40.433 --> 01:05:42.066
It all depends on me!

01:05:42.068 --> 01:05:43.967
It's all right.
It's all right, Adam.

01:05:43.969 --> 01:05:45.602
Rosh Hashanah. Oh, God!

01:05:45.604 --> 01:05:47.638
Oh, God, bar Mitzvahs!

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.473
Oh, God!

01:05:49.475 --> 01:05:51.642
Adam, that was really good.

01:05:51.644 --> 01:05:54.111
Really good!

01:05:54.113 --> 01:05:56.046
I'm here.

01:06:04.622 --> 01:06:08.058
Hey, boss, can I get
the Crescent wrench?

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:10.527
Yeah, here.

01:06:10.529 --> 01:06:13.364
Ah, gracias.
You have soft hands.

01:06:13.366 --> 01:06:14.965
Ugh. Hey, boss, you remember
that one time we went to--

01:06:14.967 --> 01:06:16.633
Shh, shh, shh!

01:06:16.635 --> 01:06:19.970
Don't say a word.

01:06:19.972 --> 01:06:21.605
Hey, hey, beautiful.
How you doing?

01:06:21.607 --> 01:06:24.975
Oh, nothing, you know.
Just here at the hospital.

01:06:24.977 --> 01:06:27.511
Checking in on patients,
patients, patients.

01:06:27.513 --> 01:06:29.046
What's up, baby?

01:06:29.048 --> 01:06:32.750
And he talked to the chief
of police in Skokie.

01:06:32.752 --> 01:06:34.818
And there's no record
of any Rosenbergs

01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:36.520
being shot and killed by hunters.

01:06:36.522 --> 01:06:39.957
In fact, there hasn't been
a hunting-related death

01:06:39.959 --> 01:06:42.493
in Skokie... Ever.

01:06:42.495 --> 01:06:44.928
So I went online to research it,
and I couldn't find anything.

01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:47.998
Alison, I didn't wanna
have to tell you this,

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.933
but my parents...

01:06:49.935 --> 01:06:52.970
Were in the Witness
Protection program.

01:06:52.972 --> 01:06:56.173
And when they were murdered,
the FBI destroyed their records.

01:06:56.175 --> 01:06:58.041
<i>Oye,</i> boss, <i>tu estas loco.</i>

01:06:58.043 --> 01:07:00.411
What were they doing in the
Witness Protection program?

01:07:00.413 --> 01:07:02.679
- Jimmy hoffa?
- What about Jimmy hoffa?

01:07:02.681 --> 01:07:05.082
Look, I've said too much
already, do you understand?

01:07:05.084 --> 01:07:06.884
Avi, I just feel like you're
hiding things from me.

01:07:06.886 --> 01:07:10.654
And you never tell me that
your parents were murdered

01:07:10.656 --> 01:07:12.189
by elk hunters?

01:07:12.191 --> 01:07:13.724
And now they're in the
Witness Protection program?

01:07:13.726 --> 01:07:17.127
I'm just starting to wonder
if you might be... Gay.

01:07:17.129 --> 01:07:22.032
Whoa, whoa.
Why would you think I'm gay?

01:07:22.034 --> 01:07:23.667
Because what guy goes out
with a girl for a whole month

01:07:23.669 --> 01:07:25.469
and doesn't wanna sleep with her?

01:07:25.471 --> 01:07:27.805
I do, I wanna sleep
with you. I just...

01:07:27.807 --> 01:07:32.543
Ew. That is exactly
what my aunt Judy's husband

01:07:32.545 --> 01:07:33.911
told her right before
they got married.

01:07:33.913 --> 01:07:35.679
And 20 years and two kids later,

01:07:35.681 --> 01:07:37.448
she walks in on him tied up

01:07:37.450 --> 01:07:38.782
with a rubber ball
gag in his mouth,

01:07:38.784 --> 01:07:40.884
being sodomized by a transsexual

01:07:40.886 --> 01:07:43.220
who is dressed as Dorothy
from <i>the wizard of oz!</i>

01:07:43.222 --> 01:07:45.456
Okay, and I am not gonna
turn out like my aunt Judy.

01:07:45.458 --> 01:07:47.191
O--

01:07:47.193 --> 01:07:50.227
Okay, okay, okay.
Listen, we will sleep together.

01:07:50.229 --> 01:07:52.196
- I--let's do this, baby.
- Really?

01:07:52.198 --> 01:07:53.831
- Do you mean that?
- Oh, yeah.

01:07:53.833 --> 01:07:55.999
When? When are we gonna have sex?

01:07:56.001 --> 01:07:59.803
I get back from the medical
conference in Dallas.

01:07:59.805 --> 01:08:01.939
What medical conference in Dallas?

01:08:01.941 --> 01:08:04.041
Remember I told you about
that a couple weeks ago?

01:08:04.043 --> 01:08:06.109
When are you leaving?

01:08:06.111 --> 01:08:08.512
Like, in two hours.

01:08:08.514 --> 01:08:10.514
You know, when you in hell,

01:08:10.516 --> 01:08:14.485
maybe you and Ted Bundy
can be roommates, <i>cabron.</i>

01:08:20.892 --> 01:08:22.926
You know, Bruce, I'm
looking at a bill here

01:08:22.928 --> 01:08:28.665
for $42,765, and
considering we said

01:08:28.667 --> 01:08:30.767
we'd split all the
wedding expenses,

01:08:30.769 --> 01:08:35.205
How is your son going
crazy a wedding expense?

01:08:35.207 --> 01:08:37.040
Well, it happened during
a wedding rehearsal,

01:08:37.042 --> 01:08:39.576
so I think the case could
be made in a court of law,

01:08:39.578 --> 01:08:42.246
- this is a wedding expense.
- Nice try, nice try.

01:08:42.247 --> 01:08:44.814
He's got a well-documented
pre-existing condition.

01:08:44.817 --> 01:08:48.919
His condition was never that
bad until he met Hannah.

01:08:48.921 --> 01:08:52.055
Hey, are you implying
that my daughter

01:08:52.057 --> 01:08:53.689
had something to do
with Adam's freak out?

01:08:53.692 --> 01:08:55.559
Oh, she's not implying.

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:57.861
- She's saying.
- I had nothing to do with this.

01:08:57.863 --> 01:08:59.529
Oh, right, you're not insane.

01:08:59.532 --> 01:09:02.131
Everyone, please!
We have worked very hard

01:09:02.134 --> 01:09:04.701
to get Adam to the point
he is at in his therapy,

01:09:04.703 --> 01:09:06.837
and he has had a very tough time,

01:09:06.839 --> 01:09:08.305
but these last few days,

01:09:08.307 --> 01:09:12.075
he has truly managed
to come from behind.

01:09:13.877 --> 01:09:16.246
- Oh, God, oh, God!
- <i>Mepong, nekock--ho!</i>

01:09:16.247 --> 01:09:17.981
- Oh! Oh! Oh, God!
- <i>Oh, ping-to!</i>

01:09:17.983 --> 01:09:20.651
- Fuck.
- What the--

01:09:20.653 --> 01:09:23.319
- What? Mom, dad?
- Oh, God!

01:09:23.322 --> 01:09:24.921
Get off of my boy!

01:09:24.924 --> 01:09:26.657
What are you--
what are you doing?

01:09:26.658 --> 01:09:28.292
He never tried that with me!

01:09:28.294 --> 01:09:33.830
What is everybody doing
here at the same time?

01:09:33.832 --> 01:09:35.599
- Oh, God.
- Oh.

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:38.201
So let me get this straight.

01:09:38.203 --> 01:09:40.871
You no longer want
to get married to me

01:09:40.872 --> 01:09:43.774
because you're in love with
your Mongolian doctor?

01:09:43.776 --> 01:09:46.310
I know this must be a
shock for everyone,

01:09:46.312 --> 01:09:48.845
but when Adam finally
opened up to me,

01:09:48.846 --> 01:09:51.648
I don't know, we just clicked.

01:09:51.649 --> 01:09:53.116
What do you mean you just clicked?

01:09:53.118 --> 01:09:56.286
We are not going to get anywhere
by attacking each other.

01:09:56.288 --> 01:09:59.923
- Mm-Hmm.
- Sala, please continue.

01:09:59.925 --> 01:10:01.658
By the way, you're fired.

01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:05.629
Well, I'm Buddhist and you know,

01:10:05.631 --> 01:10:07.764
both of our religions were
born out of struggle,

01:10:07.766 --> 01:10:11.335
so we both place
emphasis on family,

01:10:11.337 --> 01:10:13.937
education, and hard work.

01:10:13.939 --> 01:10:16.073
And the intense pressure
that Adam feels

01:10:16.075 --> 01:10:20.310
is the same pressure I
feel to marry a Mongolian,

01:10:20.312 --> 01:10:23.647
so it's no wonder why
we're able to connect.

01:10:23.649 --> 01:10:25.315
For 43 grand,

01:10:25.317 --> 01:10:28.719
you could have connected with
every chick in Mongolia!

01:10:28.721 --> 01:10:31.622
Okay, sala.

01:10:31.624 --> 01:10:33.290
Hypothetically speaking,

01:10:33.292 --> 01:10:38.895
if you two to were to stay
together and get... Married,

01:10:38.897 --> 01:10:40.764
how would you raise your children?

01:10:40.766 --> 01:10:42.399
Oh, mom, do we have to
get into this right now?

01:10:42.401 --> 01:10:43.800
Well, isn't that what this is for?

01:10:43.802 --> 01:10:45.268
Okay, well, the truth is--

01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:48.772
- The truth is--
- What's the truth, Adam?

01:10:48.774 --> 01:10:51.908
The truth is, I don't know if
I want to raise my kids Jewish!

01:10:53.979 --> 01:10:56.680
- Oh, shit.
- Jesus.

01:10:56.682 --> 01:11:00.017
Who are you?

01:11:00.019 --> 01:11:04.221
Was I not a good mother to you?

01:11:04.223 --> 01:11:10.394
Who got you the trampoline
that could poke your eye out?

01:11:10.396 --> 01:11:11.895
I did.

01:11:11.897 --> 01:11:13.697
And when you were in fifth grade

01:11:13.699 --> 01:11:17.300
and you wanted to take
karate lessons in Chinatown,

01:11:17.302 --> 01:11:19.136
who drove you there
three nights a week

01:11:19.138 --> 01:11:23.940
and sat in the parking lot,
all alone, in the dark?

01:11:23.942 --> 01:11:25.942
I did.

01:11:25.944 --> 01:11:27.177
And do you know why?

01:11:27.179 --> 01:11:30.881
Because you're my son,

01:11:30.883 --> 01:11:35.152
and I love you.

01:11:35.154 --> 01:11:38.955
And how do you show
your love for me?

01:11:38.957 --> 01:11:42.192
You have doggy-style sex
with your Mongolian therapist

01:11:42.194 --> 01:11:44.394
on your wedding day!

01:11:44.396 --> 01:11:47.264
And then you say to me, "hey, mom,

01:11:47.266 --> 01:11:52.936
I'm not sure if I want
to raise my kids Jewish."

01:11:52.938 --> 01:11:55.872
Oh, Adam, that's fine!
That's fine, just--

01:11:55.874 --> 01:12:01.311
- Mom, stop it!
- Just take it right now!

01:12:05.150 --> 01:12:08.452
Oh, okay, Adam, so
you're saying that

01:12:08.454 --> 01:12:10.887
our entire time together
meant nothing to you?

01:12:10.889 --> 01:12:13.156
- We never hit you!
- We never fondled you!

01:12:13.158 --> 01:12:16.193
I got <i>le petite</i> canyon for you!

01:12:16.195 --> 01:12:18.361
Honey, honey, I think
we dodged a bullet.

01:12:18.363 --> 01:12:20.464
- Yeah, she seems nice.
- I mean,

01:12:20.466 --> 01:12:22.132
you better get a good lawyer,
freak-boy,

01:12:22.134 --> 01:12:27.938
Okay, this. This right here.

01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:30.807
You want to know why I went nuts?

01:12:30.809 --> 01:12:33.443
It's because all of you are nuts!

01:12:33.445 --> 01:12:36.113
Hannah, I'm sorry that
I can't marry you,

01:12:36.115 --> 01:12:38.115
but it's better that
we end this right now,

01:12:38.117 --> 01:12:41.952
rather than dragging this
on for a long fucking time.

01:12:41.954 --> 01:12:44.454
And mom, I'm sorry that
you had to do things

01:12:44.456 --> 01:12:46.456
that you didn't want to do.

01:12:46.458 --> 01:12:48.925
But you know what?
So did I.

01:12:48.927 --> 01:12:52.529
I joined the family business and
became "the embroidery prince."

01:12:52.531 --> 01:12:54.831
Well, how happy can a man be?

01:12:54.833 --> 01:12:58.135
And to top it off, I've never
dated a woman who wasn't Jewish

01:12:58.137 --> 01:13:00.203
my entire life.
Well, you know what?

01:13:00.205 --> 01:13:02.139
I'm not doing things for
you guys anymore, huh?

01:13:02.141 --> 01:13:05.776
I'm doing things for me,
because I love salad.

01:13:05.778 --> 01:13:07.244
- Sala.
- Sala.

01:13:07.246 --> 01:13:12.382
And that's pretty cool.

01:13:12.384 --> 01:13:14.151
I love you too.

01:13:14.153 --> 01:13:16.987
Oh, God.

01:13:16.989 --> 01:13:20.190
Are you gonna be paying
by cash or check?

01:13:22.226 --> 01:13:25.061
The dorsal slit allows a
tight ring of phimotic skin

01:13:25.063 --> 01:13:29.266
to be expanded by shortening
the skin near the incision.

01:13:29.268 --> 01:13:31.268
With this technique,
the phimotic skin

01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:33.937
is allowed to stay intact,

01:13:33.939 --> 01:13:36.273
and finally, the neocrosing crush.

01:13:36.275 --> 01:13:38.108
By using the Tara Klamp,

01:13:38.110 --> 01:13:40.210
the skin is crushed
for around ten days,

01:13:40.212 --> 01:13:43.013
until it suffocates and dies.

01:13:43.015 --> 01:13:45.348
With this technique, the skin bonds

01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:47.117
without needing sutures.

01:13:47.119 --> 01:13:49.052
- Oh, this is tough, though.
- Yeah.

01:13:49.054 --> 01:13:51.121
I mean--I mean, you gotta
love the dorsal slit.

01:13:51.123 --> 01:13:52.455
- Well.
- Right?

01:13:52.457 --> 01:13:58.195
I got the widest variety
of scarring options.

01:13:58.197 --> 01:14:02.399
Honestly, I'm kind of partial
to the temporary crush.

01:14:02.401 --> 01:14:06.102
Of the sleeve resection, but
you get that pump action

01:14:06.104 --> 01:14:08.238
- of the gomco device there.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:12.008
Plus, it reduces your
smegma by, like, 75%.

01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:13.009
- It does?
- Yeah.

01:14:13.011 --> 01:14:14.945
Done, sold.

01:14:14.947 --> 01:14:17.013
Going with the
temporary crush, boy.

01:14:17.015 --> 01:14:20.851
Snip-snip time,
Mr. O'Connell.

01:14:20.853 --> 01:14:23.353
- Oh.
- Whew.

01:14:23.355 --> 01:14:26.456
- Is this your life partner?
- Who?

01:14:26.458 --> 01:14:31.928
- Okay.
- Not that that's weird at all,

01:14:31.930 --> 01:14:34.030
- but just, you know.
- Okay, Mr. O'Connell.

01:14:34.032 --> 01:14:36.433
So me going to turn this
little knobby here on,

01:14:36.435 --> 01:14:39.436
and you're going to
just slowly drift away.

01:14:39.438 --> 01:14:43.039
Me want you to breathe,
relax, enjoy it.

01:14:45.344 --> 01:14:46.910
Breathe in, breathe in.

01:14:46.912 --> 01:14:48.912
- I'm scared.
- You have nothin'

01:14:48.914 --> 01:14:50.380
to be afraid of, boy.

01:14:50.382 --> 01:14:52.182
Nurse boo is Goin' sing
you a little ditty

01:14:52.184 --> 01:14:54.451
- and make you feel all better.

Mr. O'Connell.

01:15:27.552 --> 01:15:31.922
Next time, don't trust your
circumcision to an hmo.

01:15:38.697 --> 01:15:40.630
I think she's nice.

01:15:40.632 --> 01:15:43.266
I just--I can't believe
that you're doing all of this

01:15:43.268 --> 01:15:45.568
just so you don't have to
make any more decisions.

01:15:45.570 --> 01:15:48.705
Oh, Adam.
You don't get it.

01:15:48.707 --> 01:15:51.107
All those things that you say
drive you crazy, I love.

01:15:51.109 --> 01:15:52.943
- Ah.
- I love that your parents

01:15:52.945 --> 01:15:55.111
smother you.
I love that

01:15:55.113 --> 01:15:58.682
if they hear about a tornado
in Kansas, they call you,

01:15:58.684 --> 01:16:01.017
even though you live
in Los Angeles.

01:16:01.019 --> 01:16:02.652
Yeah, we're very nervous people.

01:16:02.654 --> 01:16:06.022
You email each other
your itineraries

01:16:06.024 --> 01:16:09.292
because--
because you never know.

01:16:09.294 --> 01:16:11.127
- You know?
- No.

01:16:11.129 --> 01:16:13.663
- You never know.
- Never know.

01:16:13.665 --> 01:16:16.733
For the past 5,000 years,
every civilization,

01:16:16.735 --> 01:16:19.302
every culture has tried to
have you guys annihilated.

01:16:19.304 --> 01:16:21.604
- Yeah, we are not liked.
- I like you.

01:16:21.606 --> 01:16:23.173
Like, you're getting the...

01:16:23.175 --> 01:16:29.045
Now, Mohammed El-sheikh
El sheen El-sheikh is up here.

01:16:29.047 --> 01:16:31.748
Now, he's gonna come up here,
and then, we got Mohammed--

01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:33.984
- Muhammad Ali?
- No.

01:16:33.986 --> 01:16:37.053
Stop that.

01:16:37.055 --> 01:16:38.755
O'Connell here.
Speak up!

01:16:38.757 --> 01:16:40.457
Hi, daddy, it's your
son, Christian!

01:16:40.459 --> 01:16:43.560
I'm in Tahiti having
myself a mai tai.

01:16:43.562 --> 01:16:45.395
What in the hell do
you think I'm doing?

01:16:45.397 --> 01:16:49.165
Fighting terrorists,
spreading democracy.

01:16:49.167 --> 01:16:50.633
Dad, guess what I'm doing?
Oh, I'm here

01:16:50.635 --> 01:16:52.202
with Adam lipschitz.
You remember him?

01:16:52.204 --> 01:16:54.104
Adam lipschitz?
Didn't I order you

01:16:54.106 --> 01:16:55.538
to stay away from that boy?

01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:57.374
No, daddy, we're life partners.

01:16:57.376 --> 01:16:59.209
No, sir, that's inaccurate, sir!

01:16:59.211 --> 01:17:00.577
Life partners?
Now, what the hell

01:17:00.579 --> 01:17:03.613
- Means he's a homo, dad.
- What?

01:17:03.615 --> 01:17:08.084
Yeah, we're here at the
hospital, you know,

01:17:08.086 --> 01:17:09.719
'cause I--he's with me
so I can get circum--

01:17:09.721 --> 01:17:11.755
- circumcised, sir.
- What--no, not for me, though.

01:17:11.757 --> 01:17:13.390
Circumcised!

01:17:13.392 --> 01:17:14.758
Circumcised?

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:16.426
Yeah, so I can be a Jew, daddy.

01:17:16.428 --> 01:17:18.161
You can be a--
a Jew?

01:17:18.163 --> 01:17:19.796
Daddy, I want to tell
you something too,

01:17:19.798 --> 01:17:21.398
because I don't think I've
ever told you this before.

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:24.167
We never say this, but I love you.

01:17:24.169 --> 01:17:26.569
Daddy, I love you.

01:17:26.571 --> 01:17:27.570
Hi.

01:17:27.572 --> 01:17:29.305
- Ow!
- Sorry.

01:17:29.307 --> 01:17:30.707
- Ugh.
- You know, I'm glad

01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:34.444
like something's missing.

01:17:34.446 --> 01:17:36.413
- ♪ <i>A little bit off the top</i> ♪
- Ow.

01:17:36.415 --> 01:17:39.149

01:17:42.788 --> 01:17:45.088

01:17:47.391 --> 01:17:52.362
- Want to have sex?
- Mm... Not really.

01:17:52.364 --> 01:17:53.363
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:17:53.365 --> 01:17:56.433
- Clear left!
- Clear right!

01:17:56.435 --> 01:18:01.571
Didn't I order you to keep
your son away from my son?

01:18:01.573 --> 01:18:04.541
- Excuse me?
- Don't you play dumb with me,

01:18:04.543 --> 01:18:06.142
shit-lives.

01:18:06.144 --> 01:18:09.412
- Buck O'Connell?
- Oh, jeez!

01:18:09.414 --> 01:18:14.851
Your Adam has turned my
Christian into some gay Jew!

01:18:14.853 --> 01:18:16.686
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Buck, slow down.

01:18:16.688 --> 01:18:18.488
What are you talking about?

01:18:18.490 --> 01:18:21.858
They're life partners.

01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:24.327
Life partners?

01:18:24.329 --> 01:18:27.163
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What makes you think this?

01:18:27.165 --> 01:18:29.232
He called and told me

01:18:29.234 --> 01:18:32.402
while he was in
hospital with your Adam

01:18:32.404 --> 01:18:36.106
that he was about to
get his pecker chopped

01:18:36.108 --> 01:18:40.577
so they could be gay Jews together.

01:18:40.579 --> 01:18:43.646
And then, he told me,
"dad, I love you."

01:18:43.648 --> 01:18:47.484
What the hell is going on, huh?

01:18:47.486 --> 01:18:52.355
Oh, Dennis, we pushed him
too far, and he snapped.

01:18:52.357 --> 01:18:53.823
With all the pressure
that we put on him

01:18:53.825 --> 01:18:56.326
to marry a Jewish girl,
the Asian wasn't enough,

01:18:56.328 --> 01:18:59.762
and--and--and he--
he went the other way.

01:18:59.764 --> 01:19:02.632
- Oh, God.
- Okay, Buck, first of all,

01:19:02.634 --> 01:19:06.336
- Whoa, hey, hey, hey, whoa.
- Take it easy, old man.

01:19:06.338 --> 01:19:09.839
I'm having a hard time
believing any of this.

01:19:09.841 --> 01:19:13.710
Oh, yeah?
Then where's your boy right now?

01:19:13.712 --> 01:19:15.778
Buddy, I'm so happy you're here,

01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:21.251
- Yeah, please.
- I gotta be honest,

01:19:21.253 --> 01:19:25.221
And how many times a day
do you have to do it?

01:19:25.223 --> 01:19:27.223
Oh! Really, I can't
do this myself.

01:19:27.225 --> 01:19:28.892
- Please, come and do it.
- God.

01:19:28.894 --> 01:19:30.660
- Come on, just help me.
- Okay.

01:19:30.662 --> 01:19:32.729
Come here.
Put some of that jelly on it,

01:19:32.731 --> 01:19:34.731
- and let's get going.
- Okay.

01:19:34.733 --> 01:19:37.400
I may gag a little
as we're going here, but--

01:19:37.402 --> 01:19:38.601
- that's okay.
- Oh, God.

01:19:38.603 --> 01:19:40.770
Everyone gags.

01:19:40.772 --> 01:19:42.405
- Ugh.
- Everyone gags.

01:19:42.407 --> 01:19:45.542
- Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-hoo-hoo.
- Oh.

01:19:45.544 --> 01:19:47.243
- Oh, that's good, that's good.
- Ugh.

01:19:48.914 --> 01:19:50.214
I'm actually really
happy that you went

01:19:50.215 --> 01:19:53.216
- Really, how's it look?
- Yeah, it looks really good.

01:19:53.218 --> 01:19:54.851
More vaseline, more vaseline.

01:19:54.853 --> 01:19:56.553
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Clear!

01:19:57.756 --> 01:19:59.289
Oh, God!
What?

01:19:59.291 --> 01:20:00.890
- Ten-hut!
- Drop...

01:20:00.892 --> 01:20:05.695
The petroleum jelly, and back
away from my son's anus.

01:20:05.697 --> 01:20:08.531
Holy shit.

01:20:08.533 --> 01:20:10.433
- I knew it.
- Don't shoot him, dad.

01:20:10.435 --> 01:20:11.534
- Mom?
- Adam.

01:20:11.536 --> 01:20:12.569
- Dad?
- Damn it, Adam,

01:20:12.571 --> 01:20:14.437
jelly's for toast!

01:20:16.307 --> 01:20:19.809
Alison, I'm not a Jew,
and I'm not a doctor,

01:20:19.811 --> 01:20:21.377
and my name is not Avi Rosenberg.

01:20:21.379 --> 01:20:23.279
Well, then who the hell are you?

01:20:23.281 --> 01:20:25.848
I'm Christian Thadius
Reginald Mcarthur O'Connell.

01:20:25.850 --> 01:20:31.321
I begged my friend
Adam here to help me

01:20:31.323 --> 01:20:35.258
pass myself off as a Jew so that
you'd be able to date me.

01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:36.826
Penis club?

01:20:36.828 --> 01:20:39.229
Alison, how's it going.
Marcy.

01:20:39.231 --> 01:20:40.463
Don't you even look at me.

01:20:40.465 --> 01:20:42.332
- Rabbi, I'm so sorry.
- You.

01:20:42.334 --> 01:20:44.267
- "Penis club"?
- Before Adam came along,

01:20:44.269 --> 01:20:47.403
I watched nascar, and I had
the heads of dead animals

01:20:47.405 --> 01:20:51.574
and I had no idea that when you
order a salad at a restaurant

01:20:51.576 --> 01:20:53.576
you can order the dressing
on the side--

01:20:53.578 --> 01:20:56.012
let alone custom-create
your own dishes off the menu.

01:20:56.014 --> 01:20:58.748
Hell are you talking about?
I fed you Caesar salad.

01:20:58.750 --> 01:21:01.718
Jews can custom-create their
own dishes off the menu.

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:03.920
They're always up to something.

01:21:03.922 --> 01:21:05.488
I can hear you!

01:21:05.490 --> 01:21:06.956
That's why I messed
up our date so bad,

01:21:06.958 --> 01:21:09.292
'cause I wasn't being myself.

01:21:09.294 --> 01:21:10.928
And then Adam told me the
only way I'm ever gonna

01:21:10.929 --> 01:21:13.630
be able get you back is if
I could convince your mom

01:21:13.632 --> 01:21:15.298
that I was the greatest
guy in the world.

01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:17.267
So that's why I poisoned your dad

01:21:17.269 --> 01:21:20.637
with the rotten gefilte
fish, because I wanted

01:21:20.639 --> 01:21:22.672
to partner with your mom
in the bridge tournament.

01:21:22.674 --> 01:21:28.311
All right, we finally beat
the Fleischmans, schlomy,

01:21:28.313 --> 01:21:32.448
Was there ever a medical
conference in Dallas?

01:21:32.450 --> 01:21:33.850
No, I just needed time

01:21:33.852 --> 01:21:35.518
to recover from the circumcision.

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:36.919
- Oh!
- Oh, Jesus!

01:21:36.921 --> 01:21:39.889
I wouldn't mind
having circus vision.

01:21:39.891 --> 01:21:41.624
Why would you do all that?

01:21:41.626 --> 01:21:45.695
Because I love you.
Alison, I love you.

01:21:50.701 --> 01:21:52.435
Oh.

01:21:54.906 --> 01:21:58.441
And I want--I want you to make
every decision for me

01:21:58.443 --> 01:22:00.576
for the rest of my life.
Will you do that?

01:22:00.578 --> 01:22:03.713
So I'm just supposed to forget
about everything you just said

01:22:03.715 --> 01:22:05.715
because you love me?

01:22:05.717 --> 01:22:07.617
Yes, please.

01:22:07.619 --> 01:22:13.589
Son, stop this hollering and
just propose to the girl.

01:22:13.591 --> 01:22:17.527
Don't put the tongue in.

01:22:19.897 --> 01:22:21.964
Well, that haircut is awful,

01:22:21.966 --> 01:22:24.467
so let me make an appointment
for you with my guy,

01:22:24.469 --> 01:22:26.369
'cause he's the best.

01:22:26.371 --> 01:22:27.970
I should take that as a "yes," huh?

01:22:27.972 --> 01:22:30.473
- Yes.
- I'll take that as a "yes."

01:22:30.475 --> 01:22:33.543
- Oh.
- Mazel tov.

01:22:33.545 --> 01:22:36.412
Oh.
Schlomy, we've got a plumber.

01:22:36.414 --> 01:22:40.750
Christian Thadius Reginald
Mcarthur O'Connell... Rosenberg.

01:22:40.752 --> 01:22:43.886
Now, that's a nice Jewish name.

01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:49.659
We are so thrilled that
you finally decided

01:22:49.661 --> 01:22:51.127
to come on a moose hunt with us.

01:22:51.129 --> 01:22:53.363
I can't wait to kill
me a ten-pointer.

01:22:53.365 --> 01:22:54.597
I'm gonna skin him and gut him

01:22:54.599 --> 01:22:56.032
- and pull out his rectum.
- Shh.

01:22:56.034 --> 01:22:57.800
- That's the spirit.
- Nobody is pulling out

01:22:57.802 --> 01:23:03.439
- Think of it, e coli.
- You could be more--

01:23:03.441 --> 01:23:04.907
you could get bacterium.

01:23:04.909 --> 01:23:06.909
There are no wipes
here that I can see.

01:23:06.911 --> 01:23:10.980
Shut up!
Stop the kvetching.

01:23:10.982 --> 01:23:13.649
Marcy, yarmulke man, take a knee.

01:23:13.651 --> 01:23:15.918
Knee?

01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:18.588
- Oy, cramp.
- Careful.

01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:20.423
Not like that!

01:23:20.425 --> 01:23:23.559
For God's sake.
Shh.

01:23:23.561 --> 01:23:27.830
I remember when my father took
me out for my first hunt.

01:23:27.832 --> 01:23:29.732
We all fought like crazy

01:23:29.734 --> 01:23:31.534
over who's gonna be the lucky one

01:23:31.536 --> 01:23:33.770
- to pull out that rectum.
- Ah.

01:23:33.772 --> 01:23:35.505
- That's what they do.
- Oh, thank you.

01:23:35.507 --> 01:23:38.174
- Nog, baby?
- Damn right.

01:23:38.176 --> 01:23:41.878
- Nog, baby?
- Oh, daddy loves mama's nog.

01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:43.946
Nog, baby?

01:23:43.948 --> 01:23:46.516
I'm not really much of a nog guy.

01:23:46.518 --> 01:23:49.786
You know, the dairy kind of
makes my acid reflux kick in,

01:23:49.788 --> 01:23:51.687
and I'm not even sure if
the eggs are cage free,

01:23:51.689 --> 01:23:56.058
one sip won't kill me, I guess.

01:23:56.060 --> 01:23:59.195
- Nog, baby?
- Oh, yeah.

01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:04.000
Moose!

01:24:04.002 --> 01:24:05.735
Moose!

01:24:05.737 --> 01:24:06.836
- Moose!
- Oh, yeah!

01:24:10.974 --> 01:24:15.945
<i>Nar nuteng and jebei n</i> whatever,

01:24:15.947 --> 01:24:18.114
my wife and I, we want to thank
you for your hospitality

01:24:18.116 --> 01:24:20.450
- and for these beautiful hats.
- Oh.

01:24:25.056 --> 01:24:26.756
My father says it's an honor

01:24:26.758 --> 01:24:29.792
and they've learned a
great deal of wisdom

01:24:29.794 --> 01:24:31.027
from all of you this week.

01:24:31.029 --> 01:24:32.695
Thank you, thank you.

01:24:35.099 --> 01:24:37.133
My mother says you're gonna
love the fried marmot.

01:24:37.135 --> 01:24:39.735
- It's a speciality.
- Oh, Dennis, did you hear that?

01:24:39.737 --> 01:24:44.740
I can have fried food
once every few months.

01:24:44.742 --> 01:24:47.743
That you shouldn't have
fried food, I just--

01:24:54.586 --> 01:24:56.552
- Just eat what they order.
- But I--why?

01:24:56.554 --> 01:25:01.224
We're not even kosher.
