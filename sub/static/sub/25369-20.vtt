What? Where am I now?

00:10.677 --> 00:13.055
Oh, right,
back in my own room.

00:13.055 --> 00:16.808
And in my own body. At last.

00:21.647 --> 00:24.107
So not only did Doc Ock
swap minds with me

00:24.107 --> 00:26.860
to try and be the
Superior Spider‐Man,

00:26.860 --> 00:29.071

Sweetie,
I just saw you yesterday.

00:40.165 --> 00:42.751
Right. Y‐Yeah, of course.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.836
It just feels
like it's been forever

00:44.836 --> 00:49.091
since I devoured
some of your delicious...
wheatcakes?

00:49.091 --> 00:50.926
What's this?

00:50.926 --> 00:53.178
You encouraged us
to eat healthier, Pete,

00:53.178 --> 00:55.347
so this is healthier.

00:55.347 --> 00:59.059
Uh, right.
That was just a phase.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.436
I'm way over that now.

01:01.436 --> 01:03.772
Well, we promised each other
we'd eat better,

01:03.772 --> 01:07.859

granola to my wheatcakes.

[Mr. Negative]
Nice work in there,

I was positive I'd run
into you some day.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.722
I just made that one up.
Science jokes are hilarious,
don't you think?

02:18.722 --> 02:22.893
Spider‐Man? You have
no idea what you have
gotten yourself into.

This must be Molten Man.

Are you guys fighting
over which one of you
has the weirdest powers?

Because I can go
ahead and tell you
it's pretty much a tie.

This isn't your problem, bug.

Well, I mean, I'm sure
I just saw you recently

probably 'cause we're still
good friends and classmates,
too,

05:20.445 --> 05:22.948

Good morning.

Why wouldn't I be?

05:36.503 --> 05:38.129
So let me guess, Miles‐‐

05:38.129 --> 05:40.382
Ock somehow managed to make
Gwen and Anya mad at me?

Gwen, Anya,

05:42.300 --> 05:47.472

05:48.640 --> 05:52.060
What, he ruined
my grade point average?

05:52.060 --> 05:54.062
Improved it, actually.

05:54.062 --> 05:57.607
But you don't go
to Horizon anymore.

05:57.607 --> 05:59.442
What?

You quit. I mean, Ock quit.

Who was you. You follow?
And it wasn't pretty.

06:06.074 --> 06:09.536
So you should probably
get off campus
before Max runs into you.

06:09.536 --> 06:12.914
You‐‐ Ock you‐‐
pretty much told him off
before walking out.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.791
You're back at Midtown High now.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.877

it'd be more than just
a clean room and no wheatcakes.

06:25.343 --> 06:29.055
Wait. Midtown High's
closed for repairs?

06:29.055 --> 06:32.142
Right. The fight with Venom
really damaged Midtown.

06:32.142 --> 06:36.187
Is there any part of my life
Ock didn't put
into complete disarray?

06:37.480 --> 06:40.567
Hey.
Not sure if you can hear me,

06:40.567 --> 06:42.944
but I wanted to see
how you were.

06:45.155 --> 06:49.951
That's not entirely true.
I guess I wanted you
to see how I was.

06:49.951 --> 06:52.621
I know you did the right thing
in the end, Otto.

06:52.621 --> 06:56.124
You were willing to sacrifice
everything to switch
our bodies back.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.376
You did the heroic thing,

06:58.376 --> 07:02.005
but you were also the villain
who caused all of this in
the first place.

07:02.005 --> 07:03.757
You know you made
a real mess of my life.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.551
I don't think you ever thought
about your effect on me.

07:06.551 --> 07:10.472
He affected my world too.

07:10.472 --> 07:13.433
He saved my life.
Saved my school.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.852
Nothing positive came out
of what he did to me.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.480
That's not true.

07:18.480 --> 07:21.691
I've researched Doc Ock's
criminal history and I belie‐‐

07:21.691 --> 07:25.445
hope‐‐ that after what he went
through trying to be you,

07:25.445 --> 07:27.947
he'll never return
to crime again.

07:27.947 --> 07:31.701
I would put that
in the plus column.

07:31.701 --> 07:35.747
[sighs]
I learned a lot about him
through all this.

07:35.747 --> 07:38.291
Our childhoods were actually
very much alike.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.502
Then what went wrong?

07:40.502 --> 07:44.673
A lot of things,
but mostly Otto was isolated.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.132
He had no one.

07:46.132 --> 07:49.928
Well, he's not alone anymore.

07:49.928 --> 07:53.932
[laughs]
And I feel like I am now.

07:53.932 --> 07:57.143
I can't even imagine
what you're going through,

07:57.143 --> 07:59.896
but I'm sure you're not
as alone as you think.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.273
As Spider‐Man, you've got
to associate with people

08:02.273 --> 08:04.693
who have seen some
really strange stuff.

08:04.693 --> 08:07.153
There isn't some friend
you can talk to,

08:07.153 --> 08:11.241
who might be able to relate?

08:11.241 --> 08:13.493
Ms. Marvel's an Avenger,

08:13.493 --> 08:15.995
so the bizarreness
of mind‐swapping's probably just

08:15.995 --> 08:17.706
a typical Tuesday for her.

08:17.706 --> 08:20.417
She's probably used to it.

08:20.417 --> 08:23.670
Oh, voicemail. Okay, yeah.
I know how to leave a voicemail.

08:23.670 --> 08:28.133

It's Peter, Peter Parker.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.552

to see what you've been up to,

08:30.552 --> 08:33.012
other than obvs Avengers stuff,

08:33.012 --> 08:35.223
but um, you know, if you wanna
give me a call back,

08:35.223 --> 08:38.435
I'd be agreeable
with that option.

08:38.435 --> 08:44.190

on the flipside. Lates.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.652

08:47.652 --> 08:50.905
Why does she make me so nervous?

08:50.905 --> 08:54.617
You know what?
I can do better in person.

08:54.617 --> 08:57.454
I mean, couldn't do worse
in person, right?

09:00.707 --> 09:04.544
Whoa, what's happened here?

09:04.544 --> 09:07.589
So either Hulk's been playing
dodgeball with flaming meteors
again‐‐

09:07.589 --> 09:10.592
which is more likely
than people realize‐‐

09:10.592 --> 09:13.094

have been attacked.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.600
No sign of the attackers

09:18.600 --> 09:20.518
or the Avengers.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.979
Maybe there's a chance this was
just a Thor birthday party

09:22.979 --> 09:25.565
gone completely out of control?
Maybe?

09:29.444 --> 09:30.570
What?

09:34.741 --> 09:36.743
Sand?

09:36.743 --> 09:38.578
Okay, one thing's for certain.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.539
This is definitely not
a birthday party gone wrong.

the kind Spot uses.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.725
And sand? Sandgirl?

10:00.725 --> 10:03.103
And who on earth threw Hulk?

10:03.103 --> 10:05.355
Who on earth could throw Hulk?

10:05.355 --> 10:06.815
Did a bunch of villains

10:06.815 --> 10:08.817
start some kind
of anti‐Avengers club?

10:08.817 --> 10:10.610
I wonder where‐‐

10:10.610 --> 10:13.655
Ms. Marvel. Maybe that's
why she didn't pick up.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.657
She's in trouble.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.826
Hope they're near by,
not on the moon or something.

you know I'm sort of
an honorary Avenger.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.452
This ends now.

11:42.452 --> 11:46.247
[owl hooting]

11:46.247 --> 11:47.832
Oh, great.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.126
I issue one of my most
intense challenges

11:50.126 --> 11:52.754
to a nocturnal bird.

11:52.754 --> 11:57.508
So Sandgirl got Iron Man,
Spot got Hulk,

11:57.508 --> 11:58.676
and someone with light blasts

11:58.676 --> 11:59.886
and teleportation powers

11:59.886 --> 12:01.804
got Ms. Marvel and Cap?

12:01.804 --> 12:03.806
Why didn't anyone attack me?

12:03.806 --> 12:06.476
I'm gonna try not to take
this personally.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.895
[gasps]
Don't mess with us Avengers.

12:12.273 --> 12:13.816
You're not an Avenger.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.736
Black Widow.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.948
Well, I'm kind of like
Avengers‐adjacent, right?

12:19.948 --> 12:21.157
Not really.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.909
Which means you're in luck

12:22.909 --> 12:26.329
because someone's focused on
taking us down one‐by‐one.

12:26.329 --> 12:28.665
I'm trying to figure out
who it is.

12:28.665 --> 12:31.459
Me, too.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.920
By shouting at owls
in a public park?

12:33.920 --> 12:35.922
[owl hooting]

12:35.922 --> 12:38.841
That was a private moment.

12:38.841 --> 12:41.261
So far looks like Sandgirl
and Spot,

12:41.261 --> 12:44.222
but who attacked Cap
and Ms. Marvel?

12:44.222 --> 12:47.725
Seemed like Cloak and Dagger,
but I didn't get a visual.

12:47.725 --> 12:48.935
Cloak and who?

12:48.935 --> 12:50.895
Cloak and Dagger?

12:50.895 --> 12:53.481
You're the one that brought
them down, Spider‐Man.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.149
Oh, yeah, right. Of course.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.901
That was totally me.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.906
Why would those four attack
Avengers?

13:01.906 --> 13:03.199
I don't believe they did.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.618
Every one of them
is currently behind bars

13:05.618 --> 13:06.619
in The Cellar.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.413
Then obviously they escaped.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.248
No one escapes The Cellar.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.959
Before it opened, they hired me
to test the facility.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.461
Even I couldn't get out.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.588
Don't ever tell anyone that.

13:17.588 --> 13:20.800
So I'm sure you have another
theory about who's behind this.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.136
Your recent out‐of‐the‐box
methods of fighting crime

13:23.136 --> 13:24.971
have been impressive.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.431
Impressive?

13:26.431 --> 13:28.433
People keep telling me I was
acting like a jerk.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.977
Sure, but an impressive jerk.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.523
That's gotta be Electro.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.317
Another villain
from The Cellar?

13:40.987 --> 13:43.281
Molten Man? He was locked up
there just this morning.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.037
You might be on to something,
webs.

13:49.037 --> 13:51.914
Maybe The Cellar isn't
as secure as it once was.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.708
Black Widow complimenting me?

13:53.708 --> 13:55.877
I am so gonna post that
on social media.

14:03.301 --> 14:05.595
Whoa!

14:05.595 --> 14:07.722
But I'm not gonna post
about this!

14:09.265 --> 14:11.726
Whoa.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.728
This is the worst game of tag.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.774
Okay, guess I'm it.

14:21.152 --> 14:22.653
Spider‐Man!

14:33.331 --> 14:35.333
Widow!

14:40.171 --> 14:43.841
Okay, so no one's
attacking me again?

14:43.841 --> 14:45.301
I'm right here.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.386
I'm totally taking this
personally now.

14:47.386 --> 14:50.306
At least I managed to get a
Spider tracer on Widow.

14:50.306 --> 14:53.101
I just hope the Spot didn't
transport her out of range.

14:53.101 --> 14:55.019
And it looks like he did.

14:55.019 --> 14:58.356
Great. Lost another Avenger.

14:58.356 --> 15:02.443
[woman]
Not a chance. It's simply not
possible, Spider‐Man.

15:02.443 --> 15:03.986
Sandgirl, Spot, and the others

15:03.986 --> 15:05.530
are all locked up
in The Cellar.

15:05.530 --> 15:08.866
I know it sounds crazy,
but trust me.

15:08.866 --> 15:10.243
These villains captured
the Avengers

15:10.243 --> 15:12.662
and transported them
to who knows where.

15:12.662 --> 15:13.788
This is big.

15:13.788 --> 15:15.331
I agree it's big,

15:15.331 --> 15:17.166
but they didn't break out
of The Cellar.

15:17.166 --> 15:20.044
Augustus Roman, the warden,
was my mentor.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.629
He's like a father to me.

15:21.629 --> 15:23.339
If there was a problem,
he would've told me.

15:23.339 --> 15:25.675
And I'm sure this Augustus
is a great guy,

15:25.675 --> 15:27.760
but Spot opens portals.

15:27.760 --> 15:31.055
Who's to say he didn't use his
powers to break them all free?

15:31.055 --> 15:33.349
Fine, if you won't take
my word for it,

15:33.349 --> 15:35.977
there's an easy way to nip
your theory in the bud

15:35.977 --> 15:37.270
so we can focus on finding out

15:37.270 --> 15:41.107
who's really behind this.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.484
<i>Yuri, it's getting late.</i>

15:43.484 --> 15:45.111
<i>Are you still at work?</i>

15:45.111 --> 15:46.529
<i>We talked about this.</i>

15:46.529 --> 15:49.157
Don't worry.
Heading home soon.

15:49.157 --> 15:50.616
I wanna introduce you
to someone.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.326
Augustus Roman, this is...

15:52.326 --> 15:54.579
<i>Spider‐Man.</i>
What gave it away?

15:54.579 --> 15:57.123
<i>I owe you a debt of gratitude,</i>
<i>young man.</i>

15:57.123 --> 15:58.916
<i>You do all the hard work,</i>

15:58.916 --> 16:01.377
<i>taking these criminals</i>
<i>off the streets.</i>

16:01.377 --> 16:03.921
<i>For that,</i>
<i>I and all of New York City</i>

16:03.921 --> 16:06.007
<i>are eternally grateful.</i>

16:06.007 --> 16:09.552
<i>It's my honor to ward over them</i>
<i>here at The Cellar.</i>

16:09.552 --> 16:11.762
Yeah, about that...

16:11.762 --> 16:14.974
Spider‐Man believes some
of your inmates have escaped.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.977
<i>I assure you there have been</i>
<i>no breaches.</i>

16:17.977 --> 16:21.522
I've just seen evidence that
tells me that's not true.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.941
<i>Let me put your concerns</i>
<i>to rest.</i>

16:23.941 --> 16:25.902
<i>Shannon,</i>
<i>could I have some help?</i>

16:25.902 --> 16:28.070
<i>This is Shannon, my assistant.</i>

16:28.070 --> 16:31.908
<i>Can you pull up footage</i>
<i>from our cameras in the cells?</i>

16:31.908 --> 16:35.536
<i>Our cells, by design, dampen</i>
<i>all of their powers.</i>

16:35.536 --> 16:37.205
<i>They can't escape.</i>

16:37.205 --> 16:38.873
<i>And as you can see,</i>

16:38.873 --> 16:39.999
<i>all of our occupants</i>

16:39.999 --> 16:42.043
<i>are still contained.</i>

16:42.043 --> 16:45.504
You said you saw some
of these criminals this evening,
Spider‐Man.

16:45.504 --> 16:48.382
Well, I didn't exactly see them.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.927
Just evidence of their powers.

16:50.927 --> 16:53.012
<i>I'll have Shannon make you</i>
<i>a copy of the footage</i>

16:53.012 --> 16:54.055
<i>so your specialists</i>
<i>can run tests</i>

16:54.055 --> 16:55.890
<i>on its authenticity.</i>

16:55.890 --> 16:59.018
<i>That was what you were gonna</i>
<i>ask next, right?</i>

16:59.018 --> 17:01.020
Maybe.

17:01.020 --> 17:04.023
<i>I assure you The Cellar</i>
<i>has not been compromised.</i>

17:04.023 --> 17:05.608
<i>And I, of course,</i>

17:05.608 --> 17:07.235
<i>will be of any help I can be</i>

17:07.235 --> 17:09.153
<i>if you need it in the future.</i>

17:09.153 --> 17:10.655
[Yuri]
Thank you, Augustus.

17:10.655 --> 17:13.157
Sorry to waste your time.

17:13.157 --> 17:15.534
You believe me now?

17:15.534 --> 17:18.371
Of course.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.081
Just because they're
in The Cellar now

17:20.081 --> 17:21.332
doesn't mean they haven't
found a way

17:21.332 --> 17:22.541
to sneak out and back.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.126
Guess it's up to me to prove it.

17:24.126 --> 17:26.003
And if I can't find
the villains,

17:26.003 --> 17:28.130
maybe I can still find
the Avengers.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.966
Boosting
the electromagnetic signal

17:29.966 --> 17:32.635
might expand the range
of my tracer's coverage.

17:32.635 --> 17:36.055
And... ha, got ya!

17:36.055 --> 17:39.225
Where's that? Underground?

17:39.225 --> 17:44.063
Oh, man, me alone against a team
of supervillains.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.649
The old red and blues aren't
gonna cut it.

17:49.026 --> 17:51.571
But Ock gathered up
some interesting gear.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.368
A negative ion displacer.

17:57.368 --> 18:01.539
That'll come in handy
with all these portals
I've been dealing with.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.291
Time for a Spidey makeover.

18:06.961 --> 18:07.795
Tada!

18:07.837 --> 18:10.131
Let's see Doc Ock try to put
together a new suit

18:10.131 --> 18:12.216
with tape, glue, and gum
like I can.

18:16.262 --> 18:19.849
Ugh, the first place I go in
this new suit is the sewer?

18:19.849 --> 18:21.976
I'll never get this stench out.

18:21.976 --> 18:23.311
[groans]

18:35.573 --> 18:36.991
According to my tracer,

18:36.991 --> 18:38.618
the Avengers should be
right here.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.329
It's not like you can hide Hulk.

18:44.332 --> 18:46.500
My tracer.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.169
This was a trap!

18:48.169 --> 18:51.005
Ice? What, is Blizzard
on your team, too?

18:51.005 --> 18:56.302
Uh, whoa,
you must be new in town.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.596
I'm Spider‐Man, and you are?

18:58.596 --> 19:01.307
I'm am called the Regent.

19:01.307 --> 19:04.602
And although my quest for
vengeance is not with you,

19:04.602 --> 19:08.272
I cannot let you get
between me and the Avengers
any longer.

19:08.272 --> 19:12.026
Man, does everyone need
to remind me
how I'm not an Avenger?

19:12.026 --> 19:16.364
Your interference stops now.

19:16.364 --> 19:19.909
You're not a villain team.

19:19.909 --> 19:22.953
You're some guy
with their powers?

19:22.953 --> 19:25.039
[laughs]
I'm disappointed

19:25.039 --> 19:28.209
it took you this long
to figure it out.

19:28.209 --> 19:29.669
No need to shame anyone.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.880
And team or no team,
I'm prepared for you.

19:36.384 --> 19:38.010
Sodium bicarbonate‐‐

19:38.010 --> 19:40.388
one of fire's least favorite
chemicals.

19:40.388 --> 19:43.641
Impressive, but there is no way

19:43.641 --> 19:47.019
you have counters
for all of my powers.

19:48.145 --> 19:49.230
Lightning rod.

19:51.148 --> 19:52.525
Classic.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.151
Like your namesake,

19:54.151 --> 19:56.195
you are becoming
an irritating pest

19:56.195 --> 19:58.072
who must be exterminated.

19:58.072 --> 20:01.158
Are you trying to banter?

20:01.158 --> 20:02.284
It's kind of adorable.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.786
Enough!

20:05.204 --> 20:07.456
Oh, come on.
What is this power?

20:16.090 --> 20:18.217
If you had left
well enough alone,

20:18.217 --> 20:21.303
you would've avoided
all of this.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.514
My hatred is not towards you.

20:23.514 --> 20:26.976
Aw, that gets me right
in the feels,

20:26.976 --> 20:29.729
but maybe this'll get you
right in yours.

20:33.816 --> 20:36.235
Wind power? Who has that?

20:41.031 --> 20:43.784
[man] Nobody move!
[man 2] Who is that?

20:43.784 --> 20:47.830
[chuckles]
You are just an inconvenience,
Spider‐Man.

20:47.830 --> 20:50.624
And that ends now.

20:53.294 --> 20:57.381
That looks like the portal
he used on Cap and Ms. Marvel.

20:57.381 --> 21:00.468
Come on, negative ion displacer,
don't fail me now!

21:02.386 --> 21:03.971
It's not strong enough.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.266
[screams]

21:07.266 --> 21:08.976
Spider‐Man, no!

21:19.612 --> 21:22.531
[groans]
Where am I?

21:22.531 --> 21:25.117
[Hulk groans]

21:25.117 --> 21:28.245
Well, the good news is
I found the Avengers.
