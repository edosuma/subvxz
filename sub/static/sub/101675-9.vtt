WEBVTT

00:01.585 --> 00:03.086
Previously on Young Sheldon...

00:03.086 --> 00:04.963
You must be
Coach Ballard's ex-wife.

00:04.963 --> 00:07.174
Yeah. Why?

00:07.174 --> 00:09.134
I'm kind of dating
your ex-husband.

00:09.134 --> 00:10.761
I knew who you were
the whole time.

00:10.761 --> 00:12.054
That's why I
came over here.

00:12.054 --> 00:13.805
Nicely played.

00:13.805 --> 00:15.641
We ought to go out for drinks
one night.

00:15.641 --> 00:16.975
Hell yeah!
(laughs)

00:16.975 --> 00:18.685
Yee-haw!

00:20.646 --> 00:22.814
ADULT SHELDON:
College is a time
for new experiences,

00:22.814 --> 00:25.817
being exposed
to exciting ways of thinking,

00:25.817 --> 00:28.028
meeting people
from different backgrounds,

00:28.028 --> 00:31.323
and the unexpected visit
from your dad in gym shorts.

00:31.323 --> 00:32.491
Hey.

00:32.491 --> 00:34.243
What are you doing here?

00:34.243 --> 00:35.953
I got a phone call.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.996
Apparently, the head of the
college wants to talk to us.

00:37.996 --> 00:40.749
Oh, good.
You sure it's good?

00:40.749 --> 00:43.001
Well, it's better than
what I thought when I saw you,

00:43.001 --> 00:44.544
which was,
"Uh-oh, Meemaw died."
Come on.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.339
I was hoping in
college you wouldn't

00:47.339 --> 00:48.924
get called to the
principal's office anymore.

00:48.924 --> 00:50.926
She's not the principal.
She's the president.

00:50.926 --> 00:53.011
GEORGE SR.:
So if you're in trouble,
you're in big trouble.

00:53.011 --> 00:54.846
SHELDON:
That's a fun way to look at it.

00:54.846 --> 00:57.349
Gentlemen, please have a seat.

00:57.349 --> 00:58.850
GEORGE SR.
Sheldon's only been here
a few weeks.

00:58.850 --> 01:01.103
I hope he's not
in trouble already.

01:01.103 --> 01:02.562
What kind of trouble?
Did something happen?

01:02.562 --> 01:04.022
Ooh, maybe it's
from when I decided...

01:04.022 --> 01:05.399
Uh, uh, all good.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.442
Uh, you keep talking.

01:07.442 --> 01:09.444
Well, I'll just get
right to the point.

01:09.444 --> 01:11.446
Uh, I would like you
and your son

01:11.446 --> 01:14.366
to meet with a very important
benefactor of the college.

01:14.366 --> 01:15.409
Why us?

01:15.409 --> 01:17.494
Well, I mean, Sheldon is...

01:17.494 --> 01:18.954
is an impressive addition

01:18.954 --> 01:21.248
to the physics program,

01:21.248 --> 01:23.709
and-and we like our donors
to feel really good

01:23.709 --> 01:25.544
about where their money's going.

01:25.544 --> 01:27.504
I get it.
You want the star quarterback

01:27.504 --> 01:29.214
to shake some hands
with the boosters.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.799
Exactly.
I'm not doing that.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.926
I didn't shake her hand,
and she's the president.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.387
No, you don't have
to shake anybody's hand.

01:35.387 --> 01:36.596
Then why did you say it?

01:36.596 --> 01:38.640
I didn't say it. He said it.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.100
But you agreed with it.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.811
All I'm asking you to do is
to go to dinner,

01:42.811 --> 01:45.856
talk about science with a very
nice and, more importantly,

01:45.856 --> 01:47.733
a very rich person.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.151
Understood.

01:49.151 --> 01:51.236
No, thank you.
Buddy...

01:51.236 --> 01:54.656
All right, uh, Sheldon,
I was brought to this school

01:54.656 --> 01:58.410
to help raise its profile,
and one of the ways to do that

01:58.410 --> 02:00.579
is through grants and donations.

02:00.579 --> 02:02.748
You-you can understand that,
right?

02:02.748 --> 02:05.167
I understand that you would like
to put the novelty of my age

02:05.167 --> 02:07.502
and advanced intellect
on display to raise some cash.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.588
(laughs):
No. Sort of.

02:09.588 --> 02:12.257
Can I speak to you alone?
Will you give us a minute?

02:12.257 --> 02:14.092
Very well.
But if you're looking to see

02:14.092 --> 02:15.927
if my father will be
a potential donor,

02:15.927 --> 02:17.971
you are barking up
the wrong tree.

HAGEMAYER:
So...

02:39.117 --> 02:42.162
how do we get your son
to cooperate?

02:42.162 --> 02:44.456
I've been asking myself that
since day one.

02:44.456 --> 02:46.291
Look, I don't mean
to put pressure on you,

02:46.291 --> 02:48.210
but there's
a lot of pressure on me,

02:48.210 --> 02:49.795
so I'm going to put it on you.

02:49.795 --> 02:52.089
Look, I'm sorry,
isn't there anyone else

02:52.089 --> 02:54.132
who can go to dinner
with this guy?

02:54.132 --> 02:56.760
So I have a unicorn in my zoo,

02:56.760 --> 03:00.389
but I should trot out a goat,
is that what you're saying?

03:00.389 --> 03:02.641
Would you donate a new library

03:02.641 --> 03:04.309
to have dinner with a goat?

03:04.309 --> 03:05.894
What restaurant?

03:05.894 --> 03:07.312
(sighs)

03:07.312 --> 03:10.524
Mr. Cooper, I need you
to understand something.

03:10.524 --> 03:14.736
This university relies
on donations for everything.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.822
For upkeep,
for salaries,

03:16.822 --> 03:21.159
for scholarships, like the one
your son is currently on.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.078
I'll talk to him.

03:23.078 --> 03:24.955
Thank you.

03:26.581 --> 03:29.876
And when you go to dinner,
wear real pants.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.339
So, there's this thing

03:34.339 --> 03:36.550
at school
I really want to go to,

03:36.550 --> 03:39.344
and before you say no, I just
want you to think about it.

03:39.344 --> 03:42.055
What is it?
Like a school function.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.516
Why would I say no
to a school function?

03:44.516 --> 03:45.600
So I can go? You're the best.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.352
Hold on.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.354
What kind of function
are we talking about?

03:49.354 --> 03:51.231
You know, just the normal kind.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.774
With some kids.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.276
And some music.

03:54.276 --> 03:56.111
You know you can't go
to a dance.

03:56.111 --> 03:57.195
Why not?

03:57.195 --> 03:58.572
You know that, too.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.073
Because we're Baptist.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.408
But all my friends
are going.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.702
That doesn't
change anything.

04:03.702 --> 04:06.037
What if I promise not to dance?

04:06.037 --> 04:07.706
So you expect me to believe

04:07.706 --> 04:10.250
that you are going to go
to a dance with your friends,

04:10.250 --> 04:13.545
they'll all be dancing
while you just stand there?

04:13.545 --> 04:15.130
I go to church and don't pray.

04:15.130 --> 04:16.882
How is this any different?

04:19.259 --> 04:21.261
MEEMAW:
Where we eating tonight?

04:22.387 --> 04:24.389
Well, that depends.

04:24.389 --> 04:25.807
Why don't you look
in the glovebox

04:25.807 --> 04:27.434
and check on the Tums situation.

04:29.728 --> 04:31.271
There's five.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.106
Oh, my, this is tricky.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.400
Well, Mexican's
at least three apiece.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.986
We might get by with two each
if it's Italian.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.947
You get red wine and
then tomato sauce.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.783
Hey, if they put lemon
in the water, we're dead.

04:43.783 --> 04:46.786
Hmm. That leaves barbecue.
Sold.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.289
Who gets Tum number three?

04:49.289 --> 04:51.666
Me. They're my Tums.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.462
Now, what do you
think young people

04:55.462 --> 04:56.963
talk about on
their dates?

04:56.963 --> 04:58.924
(chuckles):
I don't know.

04:58.924 --> 05:02.344
But my knee's telling me
it's gonna rain this weekend.

05:02.344 --> 05:05.597
Speaking of this weekend, hey,
my son needs a final head count.

05:05.597 --> 05:07.098
Oh.

05:07.098 --> 05:08.767
It's a small wedding.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.685
It'll be weird if I'm there.

05:10.685 --> 05:13.647
Aw, come on,
I'm gonna be wearing a suit.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.815
I'm very sexy in a suit.

05:17.651 --> 05:18.944
Come on, Sheldon,

05:18.944 --> 05:20.612
think of it as a free dinner.

05:20.612 --> 05:23.156
I'm a kid.
All my dinners are free.

05:25.116 --> 05:27.202
Is what they're asking
really that bad?

05:27.202 --> 05:29.538
Yes. I go to this university
to study science,

05:29.538 --> 05:33.124
not to help collect money
like an organ grinder's monkey.

05:33.124 --> 05:36.002
You see me go to the rallies and
fundraisers at the high school.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.963
I don't love it, but I do it.

05:37.963 --> 05:40.507
And I hope they give you
all the bananas you can eat.

05:40.507 --> 05:44.219
Sheldon, donors like this are
very helpful for the university.

05:44.219 --> 05:46.972
They pay for all the science
equipment and your scholarship.

05:46.972 --> 05:49.307
I hadn't thought of it that way.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.810
So I'll tell 'em
we're on for Saturday?

05:51.810 --> 05:53.395
I'll think about it.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.397
What's to think about?

05:55.397 --> 05:57.691
It's a night of you
showing off how smart you are.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.276
People do like that.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.027
All right, I'm in.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.078

06:16.835 --> 06:19.087
Did you ever go
to a school dance?

06:19.087 --> 06:20.714
One or two.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.757
How'd you get Mom
to let you?

06:22.757 --> 06:24.759
Easy. Didn't ask her.

06:26.011 --> 06:28.388
By the way, that works
for all kinds of stuff.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.849
Well, it's too late.
I already asked.

06:30.849 --> 06:32.851
Rookie mistake.

06:32.851 --> 06:36.104
Why can't we have
a fun religion?

I don't think
there is one.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.402
Come with me.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.203

06:52.203 --> 06:53.246
What is it?

Don't worry about it.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.798
Hey. I just got off the phone
with President Hagemeyer.

07:03.798 --> 07:06.384
This guy we're gonna have dinner
with sounds pretty interesting.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.720
He made all of his money
selling antistatic furniture

07:08.720 --> 07:10.388
for laboratories.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.890
He's not even a scientist?

07:11.890 --> 07:13.558
He's just a furniture salesman?

07:13.558 --> 07:14.601
(stammers softly)

07:14.601 --> 07:15.894
Yeah.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.395
What am I supposed
to talk about?

07:17.395 --> 07:18.813
Talk about whatever you want.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.899
Just... don't be insulting.

07:20.899 --> 07:23.151
What if he says something
I think is ridiculous?

07:23.151 --> 07:24.903
Keep it to yourself.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.237
What if you just said something

07:26.237 --> 07:27.572
I think is ridiculous?
Because...

07:27.572 --> 07:29.240
Okay, maybe we need
to work a little

07:29.240 --> 07:30.909
on your conversation skills,

07:30.909 --> 07:33.453
like not calling people out
for saying stupid things.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.413
How am I supposed
to practice that?

07:35.413 --> 07:37.415
What's up?

It's Connie Tucker.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.304
Hey, Connie. How are you?

07:51.304 --> 07:52.514
I'm good.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.474
Am I seeing you Saturday night?

07:54.474 --> 07:56.142
Well, that's
what I've called about.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.602
Are you sure you want me there?

07:57.602 --> 07:59.771
I mean,
it is your son's wedding.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.564
Oh, it's his second wedding.
Those barely count.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.400
Besides,
I'm bringing a date, too.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.943
Come on, it'll be fun.

08:04.943 --> 08:07.779
Okay. I'm in.

08:07.779 --> 08:08.863
Fantastic!

08:08.863 --> 08:10.323
So, how dressed up we getting?

08:10.323 --> 08:12.659
Oh, it's a small ceremony,
nothing fancy.

08:12.659 --> 08:15.370
You just saying that 'cause
you want to look better than me?

08:15.370 --> 08:17.122
Of course not.

08:17.122 --> 08:19.499
But I do believe
you'd be stunning in overalls.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.334
(chuckles)
All right.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.877
See you then.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.504
Bye.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.631
Overalls, my ass.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.633
So you really
can't dance here, man?

08:28.633 --> 08:30.301
I can't believe that.

08:30.301 --> 08:31.845
It's true.
GEORGE JR.:
See?

08:31.845 --> 08:33.680
They ain't allowed
to dance, either.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.890
It's like I'm watching my life.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.727
That's how I feel when
I'm watching Top Gun.

08:39.686 --> 08:43.565
Okay, Sheldon, try having
a conversation with Billy

08:43.565 --> 08:44.816
about science.

08:44.816 --> 08:46.276
Let's see.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.486
Uh, what do you know
about quantum mechanics?

08:48.486 --> 08:50.530
My dad's a mechanic.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.867
At his shop, he has a calendar
with a bikini lady on it.

08:53.867 --> 08:54.909
Dad...

08:54.909 --> 08:56.870
Instead of losing patience,

08:56.870 --> 09:00.206
act interested
and ask a follow-up question.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.751
Your father's a mechanic.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.169
Interesting.

09:04.169 --> 09:05.462
You know what else
is interesting?

09:05.462 --> 09:07.380
Quantum mechanics.
That describes

09:07.380 --> 09:09.340
the basic particles and forces
that make up reality.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.009
Let's talk about that.

09:11.009 --> 09:13.344
I'm gonna marry
that bikini lady.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.514
I've been working on a theory

09:16.514 --> 09:18.850
about the wave-particle
duality of light.

09:18.850 --> 09:21.019
I have a nightlight
that looks like Spider-Man,

09:21.019 --> 09:22.562
but I don't turn it on.

09:24.856 --> 09:26.232
Go ahead.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.443
Why don't you turn it on?

09:28.443 --> 09:30.195
I'm afraid of spiders.
Yeah, seems like

09:30.195 --> 09:31.780
a good place to stop.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.114
Now what happens?

09:33.114 --> 09:34.616
You go home.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.785
Thank you for your hospitality.

09:36.785 --> 09:39.204
And it was King David.

09:39.204 --> 09:43.875
King David, who-who we read
about in-in Samuel.

09:43.875 --> 09:46.044
And-and-and what did David do?

09:46.044 --> 09:47.462
What did David do?

09:47.462 --> 09:49.964
What did David do?
David danced.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.216
MISSY:
"David danced

09:51.216 --> 09:52.884
"before the Lord
with all his might,

09:52.884 --> 09:55.637
leaping and dancing
before the Lord."

09:55.637 --> 09:57.972
Leaping and dancing.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.933
I'm impressed.
Thank you.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.893
Too bad it's from Footloose.

10:01.893 --> 10:04.312
(chuckles)
What's a footloose?

10:04.312 --> 10:06.981
It is the movie that
Pastor Jeff warned us about

10:06.981 --> 10:09.400
in his talk on the
sins of cinema.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.319
Just let me go to the dance.

10:11.319 --> 10:12.946
I'm sorry. I can't.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.281
I'm never talking to you again!

10:17.659 --> 10:19.911
Did you show your
sister Footloose?

10:19.911 --> 10:21.913
Did it work?
No!

10:21.913 --> 10:23.248
Mm. Then no.

10:23.248 --> 10:24.624
(growls):
Oh!

10:26.000 --> 10:27.961
GEORGE SR.:
Now, when you meet this guy,

10:27.961 --> 10:30.004
you got to shake his hand.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.631
What if I offer a stately bow?

10:31.631 --> 10:33.091
That's how they do it in Asia.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.634
You're shaking his hand.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.679
Then it's a good thing
I brought Old Righty.

10:37.679 --> 10:40.390
(sighs) You're not wearing that
in a restaurant.

10:40.390 --> 10:41.724
Why?

10:41.724 --> 10:43.017
'Cause you don't
make a good impression

10:43.017 --> 10:44.143
by being afraid
to shake hands.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.728
Howard Hughes was a germophobe,

10:45.728 --> 10:47.272
and he did quite well
for himself.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.899
Didn't he go crazy
and save his pee in jars?

10:49.899 --> 10:50.942
Better to have it
and not need it

10:50.942 --> 10:52.235
than to need it and not have it.

10:52.235 --> 10:53.862
You're shaking his hand!
Okay!

10:55.071 --> 10:56.573
(soft chatter)

10:57.532 --> 10:59.534
Haven't been
to many weddings lately.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.327
Mostly funerals.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.621
Yeah, those don't have
an open bar.
(chuckles softly)

11:03.621 --> 11:05.081
I don't know why I'm so excited.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.749
I'm paying for this.

11:06.749 --> 11:07.876
JUNE:
Hey, y'all.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.586
Hi, June!

11:09.586 --> 11:10.753
Don't you look pretty?

11:10.753 --> 11:11.754
Thank you.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.381
I happen to agree.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.632
(chuckling)

11:14.632 --> 11:17.218
Connie, Dale,
this is Justin.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.387
Hi, Justin. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.431
You must be
a friend of my son's.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.391
Actually, he's my date.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.728
Really?

11:26.728 --> 11:27.812
Mm-hmm.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.565
Much more fun than a funeral.

11:33.651 --> 11:35.069
HAGEMEYER:
George Cooper,

11:35.069 --> 11:36.571
meet Gary O'Brien,

11:36.571 --> 11:38.489
the antistatic
furniture king.

11:38.489 --> 11:39.490
Hello.

11:39.490 --> 11:40.825
Shocking to meet you.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.619
Don't do that.
And this, of course,

11:42.619 --> 11:43.953
is our physics prodigy,

11:43.953 --> 11:45.914
Sheldon Cooper.

11:45.914 --> 11:47.415
A great pleasure.

11:47.415 --> 11:50.293
ADULT SHELDON:
I had an obligation to fulfill.

11:50.293 --> 11:53.796
So I closed my eyes
and thought of science.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.050
Just like on my honeymoon.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.015
How's pizza sound
for dinner?

12:04.015 --> 12:08.144
You think I'm eating dinner
with my mom on a Saturday night?

12:08.144 --> 12:10.271
(scoffs softly)
You're adorable.

12:11.606 --> 12:13.441
Guess I'm eating alone.

12:13.441 --> 12:14.776
What about Missy?
(sighs)

12:14.776 --> 12:16.361
She's not talking to me.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.279
She'd talk to you
if you just let her go.

12:18.279 --> 12:19.948
You know I can't do that.

12:19.948 --> 12:23.534
Come on. I went to school dances
and I turned out fine.

12:23.534 --> 12:25.787
I didn't let you go
to any dances.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.997
I did all kinds of stuff
behind your back.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.332
Like what?

12:29.332 --> 12:31.626
I'm dumb, but I'm not that dumb.

12:31.626 --> 12:33.795
So I'm supposed
to just let her do

12:33.795 --> 12:35.254
whatever she wants?

12:35.254 --> 12:37.048
Yeah, I don't think so.

12:37.048 --> 12:39.217
I'm just saying
she's a good kid.

12:39.217 --> 12:41.427
Be glad she's still asking.

12:44.722 --> 12:47.058
So, how'd you two meet?

12:47.058 --> 12:49.394
Oh, I've been cutting
his mom's hair for years.

12:49.394 --> 12:50.812
Oh, that's nice.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.438
Bet you when she cuts your hair,

12:52.438 --> 12:54.440
you get a lollipop, don't you?

12:55.400 --> 12:57.986
Oh, he gets
more than a lollipop.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.071
Really? Is that so?
Dale.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.658
Okay, so what is it
you do, Langston?

13:03.658 --> 13:04.784
Justin.

13:04.784 --> 13:05.827
Actually, I'm about

13:05.827 --> 13:07.412
to open a frozen
yogurt shop.

13:07.412 --> 13:08.746
Frozen yogurt. Right.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.915
Isn't that, like,
crappy ice cream?

13:10.915 --> 13:14.085
(chuckles) We consider it
a healthy alternative.

13:14.085 --> 13:16.421
Right. Crappy ice cream.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.131
It's actually getting
really popular.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.632
I'm gonna invest.

13:19.632 --> 13:20.675
Invest money?

13:20.675 --> 13:22.844
What else would she invest with?

13:22.844 --> 13:24.512
I don't know.
You got fake ice cream.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.431
How 'bout fake money?
Well, there's...

13:26.431 --> 13:29.308
Hey, would you mind going
to get me another drink, please?

13:29.308 --> 13:30.309
Happy to.

13:30.309 --> 13:31.728
Thank you.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.772
What's your problem?

13:34.772 --> 13:35.773
Yeah, what is your problem?

13:35.773 --> 13:37.025
Who said I had a problem?

13:37.025 --> 13:39.277
We did.
You're being rude.

13:39.277 --> 13:42.030
Okay, you want to spend
all your money on some boy toy,

13:42.030 --> 13:43.531
it's none of my business.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.700
Why do you care what she
does with her own money?

13:45.700 --> 13:47.160
Yeah, why?
Well, you got

13:47.160 --> 13:49.537
some young guy running around,
asking for money.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.456
You don't think I know
what that's all about?

13:51.456 --> 13:53.666
Okay, he didn't ask-- I offered.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.877
And I can do what I want.
I'm a grown woman.

13:55.877 --> 13:58.337
Oh, hell, you were a grown woman
when he was born.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.053
Sheldon, why don't
you tell Mr. O'Brien

14:05.053 --> 14:08.139
about some of your goals
at the university.

14:08.139 --> 14:10.600
Well, I'm pushing
for stricter dress codes.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.727
There are a lot of
belly buttons on display.

14:12.727 --> 14:14.020
Science goals.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.813
My ultimate goal
is to one day devise

14:15.813 --> 14:17.523
the grand unified field theory.

14:17.523 --> 14:18.983
Ah.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.693
You're one of those, are you?
(chuckles)

14:20.693 --> 14:22.195
Excuse me?

14:22.195 --> 14:24.989
Well, Kurt Godel's
incompleteness theorems

14:24.989 --> 14:28.826
eliminate the possibility
of a unified theory.

14:28.826 --> 14:31.204
You honestly believe that?
Sheldon.

14:32.163 --> 14:34.457
That's... interesting.

14:34.457 --> 14:36.709
Tell me more
about how Einstein's life goal

14:36.709 --> 14:38.419
was nothing but folly.

14:40.004 --> 14:42.673
What is she thinking?

14:42.673 --> 14:45.384
Maybe she's thinking, "Why did
I come here with this guy?"

14:45.384 --> 14:46.844
Wait, no,

14:46.844 --> 14:48.221
that's what I'm thinking.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.972
You know what I'm talking about.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.849
She brought him here on purpose.
(sighs)

14:51.849 --> 14:54.268
What purpose?
To upset me.

14:54.268 --> 14:55.603
You know, Dale,

14:55.603 --> 14:57.522
not everything
is always about you.

14:57.522 --> 14:59.190
Well, you're mad at me,
she's mad at me.

14:59.190 --> 15:00.691
It seems like
it's all about me.

15:00.691 --> 15:02.193
Well, you owe
her an apology.

15:02.193 --> 15:03.528
Like hell I do.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.446
Then I'm gonna
do it for you.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.240
No, wait. (stammers)

15:07.240 --> 15:08.407
Connie, wait.

15:08.407 --> 15:09.450
What?

15:09.450 --> 15:11.077
Bring me back a beer.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.580
(window opens)

15:14.580 --> 15:15.790
(knocking)

15:15.790 --> 15:16.791
MARY:
Missy?

15:16.791 --> 15:18.751
Go away.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.545
I'm not talking to you.

15:20.545 --> 15:22.547
I know you're mad.

15:22.547 --> 15:25.591
But I've been thinking about it,
and...

15:25.591 --> 15:29.887
I trust you enough to know
that you will behave yourself.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.557
So, just this once, you can go.

15:32.557 --> 15:34.058
Thanks, Mom. Love you.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.810
(rattling)

15:35.810 --> 15:37.770
MARY:
Why won't this open?

15:37.770 --> 15:39.313
Sometimes it sticks!

15:40.273 --> 15:42.066
I know, on the surface,

15:42.066 --> 15:43.651
Dale seems
like a...

15:43.651 --> 15:44.986
a bully, but,

15:44.986 --> 15:46.404
underneath...

15:46.404 --> 15:47.822
Still a bully.

15:47.822 --> 15:50.783
Well, yes,
but a little less of one, right?

15:50.783 --> 15:52.493
Sure.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.287
Thank you. You know,

15:54.287 --> 15:55.788
I'm gonna bring him
a peace offering.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.249
(Meemaw and June chuckle)

15:58.249 --> 15:59.458
Ain't he cute?

15:59.458 --> 16:01.794
Can you believe that Dale thinks

16:01.794 --> 16:04.797
the only reason you brought him
here is just to piss him off?

16:04.797 --> 16:06.507
That's exactly why
I brought him.

16:08.050 --> 16:11.095
What the hell is
the matter with you?
What?

16:11.095 --> 16:13.097
Why would you go out of your way

16:13.097 --> 16:15.600
to upset Dale
at your own son's wedding?

16:15.600 --> 16:17.476
I don't know.
He's my ex-husband.

16:17.476 --> 16:18.769
Well, he's my boyfriend.

16:18.769 --> 16:20.146
Hey, that's your problem.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.190
Well, you're starting
to be my problem.

16:22.190 --> 16:23.691
Geez, who's the bully now?

16:24.692 --> 16:26.986
(quietly): I knew
I shouldn't have come here.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.618
Your ex-wife is a bitch.

16:33.618 --> 16:36.412
I am so filled with love
for you right now.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.164
(chuckles)

16:38.164 --> 16:41.334
I believe we have to look
to gravity and its magnitude...

16:41.334 --> 16:44.170
ADULT SHELDON:
I was really doing my best
to hold it together.

16:44.170 --> 16:47.798
...could be a repulsive force
if you just add negative mass.

16:47.798 --> 16:49.675
I smiled and nodded

16:49.675 --> 16:52.178
like my meemaw's
Houston Oilers bobblehead.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.888
And I also discovered a way

16:53.888 --> 16:55.306
that we could
predict the masses

16:55.306 --> 16:57.016
of all the known particles

16:57.016 --> 17:00.019
using the Egyptian pyramids.

17:00.019 --> 17:03.689
In physics, there's a phenomenon
known as supercritical assembly.

17:03.689 --> 17:07.318
If you bring enough material
together in one place...

17:07.318 --> 17:09.737
The trick is numerology.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.739
...in the right configuration,

17:11.739 --> 17:13.991
eventually, it will explode.

17:13.991 --> 17:16.160
This is fun. Not a lot of
people I can talk to

17:16.160 --> 17:17.828
scientist-to-scientist.
(boom)

17:17.828 --> 17:20.915
We're not talking
scientist-to-scientist.

17:20.915 --> 17:23.167
You're not a scientist.
You're just a rich man that

17:23.167 --> 17:25.878
no one will be honest to because
everyone wants your money.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.633
(snorts)
Oh, don't listen to him.

17:30.633 --> 17:32.009
I mean, he's just a kid.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.011
Why don't you tell me
a little more

17:34.011 --> 17:35.096
about your pyramid
thingy? Huh?

17:39.725 --> 17:42.603
("Footloose"
by Kenny Loggins playing)

17:42.603 --> 17:45.940
