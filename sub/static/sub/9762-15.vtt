00:08.258 --> 00:11.671
In the third match of the Tenkaichi Budokai,

00:11.887 --> 00:14.378
the fight between Videl and Spopovitch

00:14.598 --> 00:19.638
went contrary to expectations,
and Videl's very life was nearly taken

00:19.853 --> 00:25.814
in the face of Spopovitch's devastating power.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.527
Gohan!

00:31.448 --> 00:40.038
N-No! |-| don't want to... I don't want to lose...!

00:44.920 --> 00:50.836
Why, you...! I can't take it anymore,
you filthy punk!

00:51.051 --> 00:53.633
That's enough playing around, Spopovitch.

00:53.846 --> 00:57.259
Carrying on like that
isn't what we're here to do.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.681
Hurry up and win, already!

01:04.063 --> 01:06.305
Spopovitch!

01:06.525 --> 01:09.062
You'll pay for this! I'll see to it!

01:09.278 --> 01:10.814
You got that?!

01:12.781 --> 01:18.947
What exactly are Spopovitch
and Yamu "here to do"?

01:19.163 --> 01:24.749
Something is slithering behind
the scenes at the Tenkaichi Budokai.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.746
Here are the senzu.

01:26.962 --> 01:28.827
Thank you, Karin-sama.

01:29.047 --> 01:34.087
Incidentally, do not let
your guard down, Goku.

01:35.512 --> 01:38.549
I'm starting to get another
bad feeling about things.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.256
Mm-hmm.

01:41.477 --> 01:42.967
So am |.

"A Creeping Conspiracy!!
The Target is Son Gohan."

03:23.161 --> 03:26.324
Moving along, we will now
hold the fourth match.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.030
Excuse me...

03:32.838 --> 03:35.500
But first, l have some news to report.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.752
Concerning Contestant Videl,
who fought a few moments ago,

03:37.968 --> 03:41.802
although she was seriously hurt,
she is not in any mortal danger.

03:42.014 --> 03:45.506
So those of you who are
fans of Videl, please be at ease!

03:53.483 --> 03:57.772
All right, the fourth match!
Here come the contestants!

03:57.988 --> 03:59.569
The fourth match will be Contestant Kibito

03:59.781 --> 04:01.692
--E-Excuse me...
--versus Contestant Great...

04:01.909 --> 04:06.323
Can I ask you to wait momentarily?
Just one minute should be enough.

04:06.538 --> 04:09.120
There is a mystical medicine
that can treat Videl-san.

04:09.333 --> 04:12.040
My father should be bringing it right now.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.619
Oh, really? A-All right, but just for a moment.

04:15.839 --> 04:16.793
Thank you.

04:17.007 --> 04:20.089
Begging your pardon,
but please wait just a moment.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.605
Father, please hurry.

04:49.873 --> 04:52.330
Father! Did you get any senzu beans?

04:52.542 --> 04:55.284
Yeah. He said he ain't
been growing them lately,

04:55.504 --> 04:57.415
--but he still had three of them.
--Thank goodness!

04:57.631 --> 04:59.872
Go on, give one to her.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.125
Here.

05:05.764 --> 05:07.254
Thank you!

05:08.767 --> 05:12.225
Excuse me, but please wait
just a moment. I'll be right back!

05:18.902 --> 05:21.518
This guy Kibito ain't your
average customer, either.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.901
That other guy, Shin, was also impenetrable,

05:25.117 --> 05:28.200
but Piccolo said he was
too far out of his league.

05:28.412 --> 05:31.904
Hmph, it doesn't matter
to me who those guys are.

05:32.124 --> 05:34.410
How I have waited for this day to come!

05:34.626 --> 05:37.993
All I care about is fighting
Kakarrot and beating him!

05:39.673 --> 05:42.756
Hey, Goten, what did your old man bring back?

05:42.968 --> 05:44.674
I'm not really sure.

05:44.886 --> 05:48.754
It looked like some kind of medicine
to give to that lady Videl.

05:48.974 --> 05:51.260
That lady sure got beat up bad, huh?

05:51.476 --> 05:53.341
She's really good, too.

05:53.562 --> 05:57.976
| wish they'd hurry and start again.
We're in the seventh match.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.477
I'm tired of waiting around.

06:00.694 --> 06:05.404
Eh? I think I'm the one
who's getting tired here.

06:11.163 --> 06:14.655
Videl... Videl!

06:17.711 --> 06:18.496
Papa?

06:18.712 --> 06:21.624
Oh, Videl, you're coming around?

06:21.840 --> 06:24.456
Excuse me! Please let me through!

06:24.676 --> 06:26.792
Excuse me, I'm coming in!

06:27.012 --> 06:29.048
Videl-san, I've got just what you need!

06:29.264 --> 06:32.848
Hey, you! Videl needs peace and quiet!
Who said you could come in?!

06:33.060 --> 06:35.346
Excuse me, I'm in a hurry.

06:35.562 --> 06:38.349
W-Why, you...!

06:38.565 --> 06:41.773
G-Gohan-kun, |-|...

06:41.985 --> 06:43.486
It's okay, it's okay.

06:43.695 --> 06:46.937
Videl-san, just take my word
for it and eat this bean.

06:47.157 --> 06:51.446
Now see here, I can't have you
giving strange things to patients!

06:51.661 --> 06:54.619
Are you dense?! This is no time
to be eating candy!

06:54.831 --> 06:56.082
You'll feel better right away.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.122
I said no, and I meant no!

06:58.335 --> 07:00.326
|-|'ll take it.

07:01.713 --> 07:04.125
C-Coming from you...

07:04.341 --> 07:08.505
I'm sure something
wondrous will happen, right?

07:08.720 --> 07:09.755
Mm-hmm.

07:09.971 --> 07:13.714
V-Videl! Don't you listen
to anything this guy says!

07:13.934 --> 07:15.765
Hey, Doctor! Say something!

07:15.977 --> 07:18.593
R-Right. Um...

07:23.110 --> 07:24.691
Hey!

07:27.072 --> 07:29.939
S-Spit it out, Videl!

07:30.158 --> 07:32.240
Okay, the others are waiting, so...

07:33.245 --> 07:35.406
Away!

07:35.622 --> 07:37.954
Damn that kid!

07:38.166 --> 07:40.748
I'm going to introduce him
to a world of pain later!

07:46.550 --> 07:48.131
Videl!

07:58.728 --> 08:01.470
|-|'m better!

08:13.702 --> 08:16.614
Sorry to keep you waiting! It's okay now.

08:18.748 --> 08:21.034
Everyone in the stands,
we thank you for waiting!

08:21.251 --> 08:23.583
Now, let's have them begin!

08:23.795 --> 08:27.538
Contestant Kibito and
Contestant Great Saiyaman!

08:42.522 --> 08:44.854
Great Saiyaman looks sort of familiar.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.728
Huh? Isn't that Son Gohan?

08:47.944 --> 08:49.730
What? Hey, let me see those!

08:49.946 --> 08:52.153
He has the exact same haircut.

08:55.827 --> 08:58.204
You're right, it's Gohan!
Y-You're kidding, right?

08:58.413 --> 09:00.199
He '5 the Great Saiyaman?

09:00.415 --> 09:03.907
No, he couldn't be!
I'm sure he just borrowed the name,

09:04.127 --> 09:06.038
and has entered in secret.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.586
Why would he need to enter in secret?

09:08.798 --> 09:11.505
You know. He's the bashful type,
isn't he? That's why.

09:11.718 --> 09:14.334
But is he any good at combat sports?

09:14.554 --> 09:17.466
Let's cheer for him!
Hopeless though we know it to be.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.640
Gohan! Good luck!

09:21.811 --> 09:23.597
--Yeah!
--Fight, Gohan!

09:23.813 --> 09:26.725
You may not take it all, but at least win once!

09:26.942 --> 09:29.604
The cat is way out of the bag!

09:29.819 --> 09:34.233
Oh, yeah. It's because that thing
I had on my head came off.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.940
And I went to such trouble
to disguise myself, too...

09:39.287 --> 09:40.402
Way to go, Gohan!

09:40.622 --> 09:43.034
You look better without the sunglasses!

09:43.250 --> 09:45.286
W-What do I do?

09:45.502 --> 09:48.960
Uh, it appears that there is a lot
going on, but are you ready?

09:49.172 --> 09:51.834
All right, please begin the match!

09:54.761 --> 09:57.969
What a fix! If they find out
how strong I really am,

09:58.181 --> 10:01.173
it will be a huge deal, and make it
harder for me to go to school.

10:01.393 --> 10:03.679
Even Bulma-san says so.

10:03.895 --> 10:06.807
That was the whole reason for the disguise!

10:11.069 --> 10:14.653
He doesn't seem like an opponent
I can beat through chicanery, either.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.241
Become what you call Super Saiyan.

10:17.450 --> 10:21.159
I want to see if you will be of any help,
in case it comes to it.

10:21.371 --> 10:25.205
Eh? H-How do you know about Super Saiyans?

10:25.417 --> 10:28.204
A-And what do you mean, any help?

10:28.420 --> 10:30.376
You will find out what I mean soon enough.

10:30.588 --> 10:34.172
First, I want to see what a
Super Saiyan is capable of.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.045
So, it has begun.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.674
Y-You've got to be kidding!

10:39.889 --> 10:42.881
How can I turn Super Saiyan
in front of all these people?

10:44.728 --> 10:47.811
What's going on?
They're talking about something.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.940
That guy told him to turn Super Saiyan.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.642
Huh?

10:57.824 --> 10:59.610
Well? How about them?

10:59.826 --> 11:03.489
No, it's not them. Their energy is too low.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.488
Gohan!

11:10.170 --> 11:11.285
Piccolo-san?

11:11.504 --> 11:14.837
What is it, Piccolo? Is something up?

11:15.050 --> 11:18.338
|-| don't know what, exactly, b-but...

11:24.017 --> 11:26.679
I'm afraid I have to make use of Gohan-san.

11:26.895 --> 11:28.760
I'm terribly sorry about this.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.221
All of you, no matter what happens now,

11:31.441 --> 11:35.025
| ask that you please not move for
a few moments, if you'd be so kind.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.442
W-What?!

11:36.654 --> 11:38.155
What do you mean?

11:40.116 --> 11:43.449
I don't take orders from
those I know nothing about.

11:43.661 --> 11:44.992
Tell us who you are.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.070
This is the Kaioshin-sama!

11:47.290 --> 11:51.033
He is the deity over all the Kaio,
including the Grand Kaio-sama!

11:51.252 --> 11:55.165
Ah! I've heard about you, from Kaio-sama!

11:55.382 --> 11:58.249
So you're Kaioshin-sama, huh?

11:58.468 --> 12:01.756
--Hey, hurry it up!
--What are you doing, idiots?!

12:01.971 --> 12:03.427
How long are you going to just stand there?!

12:03.640 --> 12:05.130
Start the match already!

12:05.350 --> 12:07.090
You're wasting our time!

12:07.310 --> 12:12.054
U-Um, the match has started...

12:15.527 --> 12:19.019
Shut up, you people!
Somethin' awesome is about to happen!

12:19.239 --> 12:21.025
Watch closely, you idiots!

12:22.200 --> 12:23.940
Now, turn!

12:24.160 --> 12:27.323
W-What choice do I have?

12:27.539 --> 12:30.872
|-| guess I'll have to quit school.

12:35.046 --> 12:40.211
When Gohan turns Super Saiyan,
what is going to happen?

12:40.427 --> 12:44.170
It is likely that that pair,
Spopovitch and Yamu, from earlier,

12:44.389 --> 12:46.926
will try to attack Son Gohan-san.

12:47.142 --> 12:51.385
However, as I said before,
please take no action against them.

12:51.604 --> 12:56.348
We won't take any action.
Gohan can easily defeat the two of them.

12:56.568 --> 12:57.648
We will see about that.

12:57.861 --> 13:01.069
Kaioshin-sama, you're saying
Gohan's gonna get beat by them?

13:02.073 --> 13:05.565
It is all right. I do not think
they will take his life.

13:05.785 --> 13:09.494
After all, those two are
only out to get strong energy.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.196
Energy?

13:22.510 --> 13:26.128
As you wish, I will turn Super Saiyan.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.804
I don't know why I'm doing this, though.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.132
While I'm at it,

13:30.351 --> 13:32.842
would you like me to turn
the level of Super Saiyan

13:33.062 --> 13:35.053
that goes beyond the barrier for you?

13:35.273 --> 13:38.811
What? Beyond the Super Saiyan barrier?

13:39.027 --> 13:40.517
Mm-hmm.

15:44.277 --> 15:47.189
I-It can't be... He transformed...!

15:47.405 --> 15:50.693
Gohan-kun... can't be... can't be...!

15:52.744 --> 15:54.530
H-Hey, look at this!

15:56.247 --> 15:59.080
Tremendous energy! It's him!

15:59.292 --> 16:03.251
As you wished, I turned Super Saiyan for you.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.796
Now what are we going to do?
Do you want us to fight like this?

16:07.008 --> 16:09.966
W-What incredible power.

16:10.178 --> 16:13.045
H can hardly believe
he's from the lower realm.

16:13.264 --> 16:15.050
Hmph, that bastard.

16:15.266 --> 16:18.633
That isn't nearly where he
was at when he took out Cell.

16:18.853 --> 16:21.845
He went and fell into a peace stupor
and neglected his training.

16:22.065 --> 16:26.399
No, even so, his power is more
magnificent than we imagined.

16:26.611 --> 16:28.943
I am not even sure whether or not
I can stop that much power.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.270
Stop?

16:30.490 --> 16:31.980
Piccolo?

16:36.412 --> 16:39.154
Th-That's the Golden Warrior, right?

16:39.374 --> 16:41.330
I-It can't be! Him?

16:41.542 --> 16:44.500
I-I can't believe Gohan was the Golden Warrior!

16:44.712 --> 16:47.624
H-Hey, when Mister Satan was fighting Cell,

16:47.840 --> 16:50.456
there were some guys like that there, right?

16:50.677 --> 16:53.669
Y-Yeah, there were. They were there,
all right. He looks like that!

16:53.888 --> 16:56.220
Well?!

16:56.432 --> 16:59.139
Just like I said, right?! Huh?!

16:59.352 --> 17:02.685
Somethin' even more awesome
is goin' to happen now!

17:02.897 --> 17:05.638
Watch closely!

17:05.858 --> 17:08.520
What's the matter? Come at me!

17:14.784 --> 17:17.150
All right, let's go take that energy!

17:17.369 --> 17:19.986
Make sure you hold him
down tight, Spopovitch!

17:20.205 --> 17:22.446
Yeah!

17:22.666 --> 17:24.156
There they are!

17:25.211 --> 17:27.292
What do you want?!

17:30.341 --> 17:31.842
What are you doing?!

17:46.733 --> 17:48.769
W-Why...?!

17:48.985 --> 17:51.317
Please, trust me.

17:52.363 --> 17:53.899
Th-Those bastards!

17:54.115 --> 17:55.400
Let me go, Piccolo!

17:55.616 --> 17:58.483
I told you! Take no action!

17:58.703 --> 18:02.616
We'll kill anyone who tries
anything funny! Got that?!

18:08.921 --> 18:11.037
J-Just be patient.

18:11.257 --> 18:14.795
O-Outta the way!
W-What are they doin' to my Gohan?!

18:15.011 --> 18:17.172
Goku-sa, what are you just watchin' for?!

18:18.598 --> 18:20.759
What are you doing to Gohan-kun?!

18:20.975 --> 18:24.388
Let me go! Gohan-kun is getting killed!

18:24.604 --> 18:26.390
Gohan ain't going to die as easily as that.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.222
Why? Why is this happening?

18:29.442 --> 18:30.727
Huh?

18:30.943 --> 18:33.059
Remain quiet and keep watching.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.315
W-Why...?

18:57.970 --> 19:00.302
Big Brother is getting killed!

19:00.515 --> 19:03.552
W-Why don't Papa and
the others go save him?!

19:03.768 --> 19:06.259
I have to save him!

19:26.833 --> 19:31.577
Spopovitch! That's good!
We've absorbed a full load of energy!

19:56.571 --> 19:58.937
That was easier than I expected!

20:09.792 --> 20:10.952
Not yet!

20:11.168 --> 20:13.329
Do not do anything yet! It is all right.

20:13.546 --> 20:17.505
Kibito will restore Son Gohan-san in no time.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.628
What exactly is going on?

20:19.844 --> 20:23.962
I am now going to follow those two,
without them noticing me.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.011
Follow them?

20:25.224 --> 20:30.093
If you do not mind, would you
all please come with me?

20:30.313 --> 20:31.928
It will be very helpful.

20:35.109 --> 20:37.225
W-W-What the hell?

20:37.445 --> 20:39.982
What is going on here?

20:40.197 --> 20:44.440
G-G-Gohan-chan...!

20:44.660 --> 20:47.242
W-What do we do, Goku?

20:47.455 --> 20:54.167
I'm going with him! Kaioshin-sama says
that Gohan is gonna survive!

20:54.378 --> 20:58.462
Besides, I definitely wanna know
how things led up to this!

21:02.720 --> 21:05.962
This will allow the Majin to return.

21:06.182 --> 21:09.174
Babidi-sama will be delighted!

21:10.937 --> 21:16.273
The mysterious young man, Shin,
is actually the Kaioshin.

21:16.484 --> 21:22.104
All of a sudden, things turn tense
at the Tenkaichi Budokai.

21:22.323 --> 21:27.443
Just what was the objective
of Spopovitch and Yamu

21:27.662 --> 21:31.075
in attacking the Super Saiyan Gohan?

22:41.944 --> 22:43.559
Heya! I'm Goku!

22:43.779 --> 22:46.316
Apparently, there's some guy
who is scheming to revive

22:46.532 --> 22:49.239
an outrageously bad monster
named Majin Boo.

22:49.452 --> 22:51.693
Hmph! I don't know anything about Majins,

22:51.912 --> 22:55.154
but I came here to settle
the score with you, Kakarrot!

22:55.374 --> 22:57.205
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:57.418 --> 23:00.706
"Terrifying Secret of the Majin--
The Mastermind Revealed!!"

23:00.921 --> 23:04.630
Videl-san, I've got a really
bad feeling about this.

23:05.305 --> 23:11.884
