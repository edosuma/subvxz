WEBVTT

01:05.331 --> 01:06.463
Who are you?

01:06.591 --> 01:08.091
Stop! Stop!

01:09.101 --> 01:10.230
Who is he?

01:17.569 --> 01:20.070
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

01:20.436 --> 01:23.500
Just shut up, Angela.
Let him do what he wants!

01:23.849 --> 01:25.181
-No! No!
-No!

01:25.242 --> 01:26.209
All right, go ahead.

01:28.990 --> 01:30.490
No!

01:31.640 --> 01:32.489
No!

01:33.041 --> 01:34.541
Grandpa!

01:39.014 --> 01:39.849
No!

01:42.141 --> 01:42.891
No!

01:50.459 --> 01:51.323
No!

01:55.707 --> 01:57.000
Help me!

02:09.144 --> 02:11.015
Please don't kill me.

02:17.554 --> 02:18.329
No!

02:20.555 --> 02:21.276
No!

02:23.024 --> 02:24.081
No!

02:27.433 --> 02:29.633
No!

02:43.552 --> 02:44.817
Okay, people.

02:46.715 --> 02:49.497
Now please take your time
in answering this question.

02:49.917 --> 02:52.073
I want you to take a
good look at Mr. Boffano,

02:52.134 --> 02:53.763
the man seated in front of you there.

02:54.431 --> 02:56.055
And tell me if you've
ever seen him before.

02:57.325 --> 02:58.034
No, sir, I haven't.

02:59.059 --> 03:00.174
I'm sorry I can't hear you.

03:00.256 --> 03:01.936
Would you pull the mic
a little closer, please?

03:04.099 --> 03:05.476
No, sir, I haven't.

03:05.983 --> 03:07.740
On TV? In the newspapers?

03:08.113 --> 03:08.897
No, sir.

03:09.760 --> 03:11.403
Do you read newspapers, ma'am?

03:12.441 --> 03:14.069
When I have the time.

03:14.509 --> 03:15.660
How often is that?

03:16.959 --> 03:17.686
Never.

03:19.714 --> 03:21.283
I am a single mother, Your Honour,

03:21.344 --> 03:22.919
and I am trying to be a sculptor.

03:23.043 --> 03:25.869
I have, well, a job all day

03:25.930 --> 03:27.855
and when I get home I take care of my son.

03:27.923 --> 03:31.108
I feel stupid saying that I don't
keep up with the news, but...

03:32.060 --> 03:35.040
Well, that's just how it is.
I don't. I don't have time.

03:35.230 --> 03:38.270
Ma'am, are you saying that you've
heard nothing about this case?

03:39.710 --> 03:41.114
Well, no, I have heard something.

03:41.970 --> 03:45.547
When I told my son that I might
be picked for jury duty, he said,

03:45.715 --> 03:48.118
'Hey, maybe you'll get picked
for that big Mafia case.'

03:48.179 --> 03:49.968
And I said, 'What big Mafia case?'

03:50.645 --> 03:52.287
And he said, 'You know, Louie Boffano.'

03:52.347 --> 03:54.814
'He's gonna be tried
for popping those guys.'

03:56.181 --> 03:58.380
And he said that popping
is when you kill somebody.

03:58.441 --> 03:59.467
I said, 'Okay, I've got that.

04:00.092 --> 04:01.509
But who's Louie Boffano?'

04:02.176 --> 04:04.977
And he said, 'Mom, come on,
he's the big Spaghetti O.'

04:10.198 --> 04:11.464
Okay, people.

04:12.033 --> 04:12.853
Enough!

04:13.775 --> 04:17.399
Well, ma'am, what I want you to understand
is that this may be a lengthy trial,

04:17.461 --> 04:19.766
and that you would be sequestered
during deliberations.

04:20.341 --> 04:21.583
So if you tell me

04:21.644 --> 04:24.587
that it would prove a grave hardship
for you to serve on this jury,

04:25.046 --> 04:26.208
I'll excuse you.

04:26.999 --> 04:29.124
Well, then I think I could get someone

04:29.185 --> 04:32.334
to take care of my son
for when I'm sequestered.

04:32.587 --> 04:33.941
You would like to serve?

04:36.215 --> 04:37.877
Um, yes, I would.

04:38.103 --> 04:38.680
Yes.

04:57.412 --> 04:58.057
Hey, Eddie,

04:58.389 --> 05:01.385
that license is registered
on the name of Annie Laird.

05:01.483 --> 05:04.574
48 Seminary Lane. Pharaoh, New York.

05:05.186 --> 05:06.828
Thanks, Joey. Take care of yourself.

05:06.969 --> 05:08.955
Hey, guess what? You were a star today.

05:09.016 --> 05:11.280
-That's bull. I was zero-kid today.
-Why?

05:11.357 --> 05:12.899
Do you know where Jesse
is on Dragon Rider?

05:13.061 --> 05:15.779
He got to the fifth dome last night, man.
I can't believe it.

05:15.900 --> 05:17.032
I can't get to the second dome

05:17.132 --> 05:19.735
without some stupid-ass
troll slave clobbering me.

05:20.335 --> 05:22.506
Well, maybe Nintendo's not your forte.

05:22.567 --> 05:23.961
Mom, it's not Nintendo.

05:24.344 --> 05:25.109
It's Sega.

05:25.170 --> 05:26.984
Maybe you should focus on something else,

05:27.387 --> 05:28.510
like your homework.

05:28.968 --> 05:30.861
Anyway, you were a star today.

05:30.954 --> 05:32.177
The star of county court.

05:32.558 --> 05:35.049
I told them my son called Louie
Boffano the big SpaghettiO,

05:35.110 --> 05:36.291
and it got a big laugh.

05:36.351 --> 05:36.850
Louie...

05:37.152 --> 05:38.159
You're on that case?

05:38.219 --> 05:39.928
Well, that's the one if they take me.

05:39.988 --> 05:42.597
All right, she just picked up her kid
at her babysitter's or something,

05:42.657 --> 05:45.191
and we're going west on
Ratner away from her house.

05:48.463 --> 05:49.508
Well, thank you, Eddie.

05:51.366 --> 05:52.665
Hey, stay with her.

05:53.868 --> 05:55.118
I'm gonna check out her place.

05:56.905 --> 05:57.642
Yeah, right.

06:00.043 --> 06:02.076
You know what? It wasn't just the
old godfather that got killed.

06:02.137 --> 06:03.412
They killed his grandson too.

06:03.545 --> 06:05.220
It made me start thinking about you and...

06:05.687 --> 06:08.749
I don't know. I'm always talking to
you about responsibility, right?

06:09.187 --> 06:10.108
Mmm-hmm.

06:12.787 --> 06:15.254
Okay, so it wasn't such a good idea.

06:16.658 --> 06:17.991
But it is a little bit exciting.

06:20.099 --> 06:21.577
I need a little excitement.

06:29.971 --> 06:31.480
Eddie, what's going on?

06:31.773 --> 06:33.235
All right, I don't know
where the fuck we are.

06:33.441 --> 06:35.820
Looks like some kind of fucking
whacked-out church or something.

06:37.379 --> 06:38.965
Maybe she's some kind of religious freak.

06:39.547 --> 06:41.160
Look, Vince,
I think we ought to let this one go.

06:41.259 --> 06:42.583
I mean, this whole thing, just don't...

06:43.255 --> 06:44.875
it just don't smell right to me.

06:45.020 --> 06:46.986
Eddie, you're fussing.

06:47.288 --> 06:48.738
She's at work. Relax.

06:49.257 --> 06:50.507
Yeah, right. Whatever.

06:50.568 --> 06:53.025
And, you know, anything in the
Reporter Dispatch about the trial,

06:53.086 --> 06:55.258
anything at all, you're gonna have
to cut it out so I don't see it.

06:55.319 --> 06:57.828
Mom, you don't read the papers,
you use it to wrap stuff.

06:58.238 --> 06:59.603
Whatever. Just do it.

07:01.201 --> 07:02.568
And, you know, when the jury deliberates,

07:02.629 --> 07:03.644
I'll have to be sequestered,

07:03.705 --> 07:05.078
which means I'll have to stay in a motel

07:05.139 --> 07:06.748
and you'll have to stay with Mrs. Kolodny.

07:06.808 --> 07:08.850
Mrs... Oh, shit! For how long?

07:08.910 --> 07:11.526
I don't know.
A week, maybe two, however long it takes.

07:12.180 --> 07:14.941
-Mom, tell me you're kidding.
-I tell you I'm not kidding.

07:15.002 --> 07:16.329
Well, why? I mean, come on.

07:16.390 --> 07:18.332
You just go in,
you come back out and you say 'guilty.'

07:18.585 --> 07:20.260
-Shh! Oliver.
-What?

07:20.321 --> 07:21.596
-Oliver.
-Say, 'Fry the sucker.'

07:21.656 --> 07:22.934
Come on, how long does it take?

07:22.995 --> 07:24.665
I don't know,
but do you think you can shut up?

07:24.726 --> 07:25.959
-Six seconds?
-Oliver.

07:26.289 --> 07:27.508
-'Oliver.'
-Oliver.

08:15.457 --> 08:17.662
And end the letter,
'Sincerely, John Slivey.'

08:17.723 --> 08:19.187
'Devotional Services Incorporated.'

08:19.247 --> 08:20.239
'Books for the Soul.'

08:22.083 --> 08:22.980
Oliver?

08:26.944 --> 08:27.657
Math.

08:28.934 --> 08:29.687
Now.

09:05.527 --> 09:08.855
Mom, I've been thinking about
this all night. You need to...

09:08.916 --> 09:10.576
All right,
she's walking towards the car with her kid.

09:14.463 --> 09:15.794
Hey, Eddie, what do you think of her?

09:17.363 --> 09:18.499
What do you mean,
'What do I think of her?'

09:18.606 --> 09:19.715
I don't think nothing of her.

09:21.915 --> 09:23.256
Do you think she's sexy?

09:23.676 --> 09:25.409
Come on, she's a fucking mommy.

09:26.681 --> 09:28.178
Well, I think she's sexy,

09:28.618 --> 09:29.442
and smart.

09:30.852 --> 09:32.719
This isn't your average mommy, Eddie.

09:34.489 --> 09:35.666
I just think she's trouble.

09:35.911 --> 09:37.518
Well, I think she's brilliant.

09:40.128 --> 09:42.361
She makes sculptures that you can't see,

09:42.422 --> 09:43.713
that you can only feel.

09:44.004 --> 09:45.981
Yeah, you want to get out of there?
She's coming your way.

10:08.604 --> 10:10.007
All right, they just turned
into the driveway.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.106
You better get the fuck out of there.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.024
Oh, come on, for Christ's sake,
get the fuck out of there.

10:18.319 --> 10:19.863
They're going in the front door.
Go out the back.

10:22.337 --> 10:23.760
Vincent, what the fuck are you doing?

10:26.050 --> 10:26.700
Oliver.

10:31.789 --> 10:34.189
All right, they're going in the front door.
You gotta get out the back.

10:34.249 --> 10:34.800
Are you hearing me?

10:35.383 --> 10:36.962
I don't want any of your horse crap.

10:37.829 --> 10:38.649
Come on.

10:39.854 --> 10:40.518
I'm hungry.

10:40.704 --> 10:41.542
What do you want?

10:44.092 --> 10:45.567
Is there anything to eat around here?

10:45.627 --> 10:46.701
Maybe a cockroach or two.

10:46.761 --> 10:48.786
Mom, it's your duty to feed me.

10:49.530 --> 10:51.684
-No, I'm sorry, can't do it. I'm busy.
-What?

10:51.866 --> 10:53.859
Feeding your buddy, Dragon Rider.

11:00.553 --> 11:03.796
All right, you turn on the
machine and I'll call for pizza.

11:04.089 --> 11:06.260
-What do you want on it?
-Oh! Some sausage.

11:06.329 --> 11:08.521
Sausage. Get out of my face!

11:08.956 --> 11:11.565
Sausages isn't crap.
What do you mean? Sausage is good.

11:11.719 --> 11:14.260
No. Hi, yes,
I'd like to order a large pizza, please.

11:21.954 --> 11:24.019
-Use your axe.
-Okay. Okay.

11:24.149 --> 11:25.524
Turn around and go and get him.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.942
Go, go, go... Die, you sucker.

11:28.002 --> 11:29.777
Okay, you got him.
Hit him again. Hit him again.

11:29.837 --> 11:31.222
-Go. Go.
-Again. Again.

11:31.283 --> 11:33.873
-Don't get away. Hit him again.
-I got him.

11:35.256 --> 11:36.531
-I did it.
-Okay.

11:36.678 --> 11:37.877
All right!

11:38.038 --> 11:39.370
-Okay.
-You're getting hit.

11:39.447 --> 11:40.722
Get him. There we go.

11:40.782 --> 11:41.371
No.

11:41.916 --> 11:43.725
-Chill out, Momba.
-Okay. Okay.

11:43.785 --> 11:44.675
Just raise your axe.

11:44.736 --> 11:46.628
-Remember, I told you.
-Right there. Yeah, yeah.

11:46.688 --> 11:47.925
Okay, now don't get hit by the fist.

11:47.993 --> 11:50.186
Hit him! You're just,
like, gonna sit there.

11:50.567 --> 11:51.601
You set me up.

11:52.961 --> 11:54.801
Okay, I'm gonna get him. There we go.

11:55.029 --> 11:57.772
You cannot run from the wrath of Momba!

11:57.832 --> 11:59.388
The Momba!

12:15.683 --> 12:16.427
Hey, Lainie.

12:16.888 --> 12:18.103
-Hey, Annie.
-Is she here?

12:18.243 --> 12:19.462
Yeah, she's coming right out.

12:31.132 --> 12:33.079
His name is Mark Cordell. He's...

12:33.697 --> 12:34.642
well, I don't know...

12:34.702 --> 12:35.969
He's very polite, but...

12:36.708 --> 12:38.713
he can be very intimidating.
You know what I mean?

12:38.773 --> 12:40.631
He knows his shit, Annie.

12:41.069 --> 12:42.883
He does Alice Aycock, Christy Rupp.

12:43.020 --> 12:45.585
He does not like
the big-dick marble cowboys.

12:46.314 --> 12:48.656
Anyway, he collects for himself,
but mostly for friends.

12:48.716 --> 12:51.459
And I mean big, big collectors,
honey, big, big shits.

12:51.519 --> 12:52.020
Like?

12:52.920 --> 12:54.620
Sato Makamoto.

12:55.690 --> 12:56.951
Bidi Karamora.

12:57.158 --> 12:58.826
My stuff's gonna go to Japan?

12:58.887 --> 13:01.005
I don't know,
just some of the names he mentioned.

13:01.396 --> 13:03.838
-Wait a minute, you didn't ask who?
-Of course I asked.

13:03.969 --> 13:05.206
He gave me vague.

13:05.327 --> 13:07.176
-And that was good enough for you?
-Well,

13:07.349 --> 13:08.324
that and a check,

13:08.767 --> 13:10.097
for $24,000.

13:11.472 --> 13:12.872
Half of which is yours.

13:15.217 --> 13:17.034
God, do I need this!

13:23.839 --> 13:24.629
Annie Laird?

13:26.191 --> 13:27.362
I thought it might be you.

13:27.422 --> 13:29.742
Inez said you might drop by
so I took a chance.

13:30.753 --> 13:32.738
I bought some of your pieces.
I'm Mark Cordell.

13:32.894 --> 13:34.011
-Hi.
-Hi.

13:34.099 --> 13:36.069
I've got a check in my bag. Thank you.

13:36.130 --> 13:37.754
Well, I didn't pay you
nearly what they're worth.

13:37.916 --> 13:39.428
No. Please, please.

13:40.603 --> 13:43.182
How do you know me? Have we met before?

13:43.340 --> 13:45.172
Inez showed me your
picture in the catalogue.

13:45.699 --> 13:46.575
Oh, God.

13:48.052 --> 13:49.799
Well, you know, she said that my...

13:50.011 --> 13:52.413
pieces were gonna go to Japan.
Is that true?

13:52.504 --> 13:54.279
-Yeah, that's likely.
-So does that mean that's it?

13:54.348 --> 13:55.656
I'm not gonna see them again.

13:55.716 --> 13:56.749
No, not necessarily. No.

13:57.218 --> 13:59.952
Do you have some time to talk this over?
Maybe have some lunch?

14:00.304 --> 14:01.843
Oh, now? You know, I'm...

14:02.755 --> 14:05.855
supposed to be upstate
by 2:00 for jury duty.

14:07.929 --> 14:09.493
Well, I wouldn't wanna
make you late for that.

14:11.299 --> 14:12.427
Well, maybe just a quick bite.

14:14.302 --> 14:15.091
So what was the first one?

14:16.270 --> 14:18.270
Okay, the first one. Let me see...

14:20.696 --> 14:21.941
The very first one.

14:22.610 --> 14:23.878
When my parents split-up,

14:24.679 --> 14:27.019
I went to stay with my
grandmother for the summer

14:27.080 --> 14:29.245
in Allentown, Pennsylvania. I hated it.

14:29.960 --> 14:32.213
So I made this model of a wild meadow.

14:32.687 --> 14:34.990
And I would keep it under the bed.

14:35.623 --> 14:38.971
It had these bushes.
It had thorns that I made out of staples,

14:39.032 --> 14:41.290
and there was a stream
made out of tin foil.

14:42.130 --> 14:43.215
And I would...

14:43.676 --> 14:44.841
reach under the bed,

14:45.633 --> 14:47.630
you know, 'cause I was afraid of the dark,

14:48.436 --> 14:50.028
and I would reach under and...

14:50.383 --> 14:51.429
just touch it

14:53.238 --> 14:54.369
and dream I was there.

14:57.078 --> 14:58.210
And that's how you got started?

14:59.002 --> 14:59.592
Yeah.

15:00.081 --> 15:01.142
So what about you?

15:01.673 --> 15:03.008
Were you afraid of the dark?

15:04.745 --> 15:06.708
Well, it wasn't really very much dark...

15:07.703 --> 15:09.776
in my house. We had a lot of kids.

15:10.113 --> 15:11.116
I was the youngest.

15:13.828 --> 15:15.120
A real madhouse,

15:16.846 --> 15:17.518
a zoo.

15:19.233 --> 15:20.006
Anyway,

15:21.003 --> 15:22.225
you wanna know...

15:22.358 --> 15:24.240
where your pieces are going, yes?

15:24.301 --> 15:24.951
Mmm-hmm.

15:25.491 --> 15:26.858
-Do you know Japan?
-Mmm-mmm.

15:27.180 --> 15:29.923
Well, contemporary art is a
sort of currency there now

15:29.984 --> 15:31.354
because its...

15:31.588 --> 15:33.196
value is so inconstant.

15:33.274 --> 15:34.021
It's so...

15:34.417 --> 15:35.573
attractively pliant.

15:35.650 --> 15:36.787
Wait a second. I'm...

15:36.980 --> 15:38.395
I'm... I'm... I'm lost.

15:40.748 --> 15:43.839
-I'm not connecting the dots here.
-None of that really matters.

15:43.972 --> 15:46.352
All that really matter is that we
need to start getting new pieces,

15:46.413 --> 15:49.187
try to record some six figure sales,

15:49.248 --> 15:51.256
get you the right review in Artforum,

15:51.365 --> 15:53.452
a proper niche at the Basel Art Fair.

15:53.513 --> 15:56.113
That sort of thing. But that's my job,
don't you worry about that.

15:56.514 --> 15:58.379
-Listen, Mr. Cordell, I...
-Please.

15:58.899 --> 15:59.732
Call me Mark.

16:00.508 --> 16:01.528
Okay, Mark.

16:01.742 --> 16:02.517
-May I...
-Listen...

16:02.866 --> 16:04.077
May I call you Annie?

16:04.138 --> 16:05.807
Yeah, you can call me
whatever the hell you want,

16:05.868 --> 16:07.520
but I'm not interested in having my art

16:07.581 --> 16:09.009
used as some kind of currency.

16:09.070 --> 16:10.829
Annie, what do you think

16:11.048 --> 16:12.980
I get out of this? You think
I make money off of this?

16:13.041 --> 16:14.262
I don't. I don't need to.

16:14.454 --> 16:16.397
What I do for a living
pays me very, very well.

16:16.457 --> 16:17.309
-Could I get you guys...
-No.

16:17.748 --> 16:18.544
Not now.

16:21.226 --> 16:24.472
I do this so that artists like
you can go into your studio

16:24.532 --> 16:25.813
and work on your boxes

16:25.874 --> 16:28.817
and not worry whether or not
your children are being fed.

16:29.662 --> 16:32.711
So that these idiots that
control the art world,

16:32.772 --> 16:34.388
these insects,

16:35.376 --> 16:36.706
you don't have to bother with them.

16:37.345 --> 16:38.334
So you can just...

16:39.533 --> 16:40.393
do your work.

16:41.313 --> 16:43.647
Hey, you guys. Okay, what do you think?

16:48.214 --> 16:49.004
Pay up.

16:49.423 --> 16:51.492
Forget about it.
You're wearing the black one.

16:51.553 --> 16:52.729
You look sexy in it.

16:52.790 --> 16:55.302
Juliet, will you stop it.
I do not wanna look sexy.

16:55.363 --> 16:57.038
-I'm not wearing the black one.
-Well, too bad.

16:57.098 --> 16:58.558
And promise me you won't
be shy with this guy.

16:58.619 --> 17:00.128
I'm not shy.

17:00.268 --> 17:01.387
-No?
-No.

17:01.448 --> 17:02.408
I'm private.

17:02.839 --> 17:04.480
No, no, no. You clam up.

17:04.704 --> 17:06.968
I just don't babble to men, that's all.

17:07.282 --> 17:08.184
Babble?

17:08.497 --> 17:10.996
Annie, this is not babble, this is an art.

17:11.512 --> 17:14.699
First you say something to pump
up his little ego, and then,

17:14.903 --> 17:17.964
with a sly little,
subtle savvy you puncture his balloon.

17:19.061 --> 17:21.394
Then you stroke
his silly little ego again,

17:21.454 --> 17:24.278
and then you push him back,
and you pull him in, and you push him back,

17:25.063 --> 17:27.099
you pull him, and you push him,
and you pull him

17:27.161 --> 17:28.733
until you've got him dizzy and...

17:29.241 --> 17:31.472
staggering and falling at your feet.

17:31.532 --> 17:32.648
-Juliet?
-Yeah.

17:33.267 --> 17:34.342
When's the last time you slept?

17:34.859 --> 17:35.773
You mean 'sleep' sleep?

17:36.771 --> 17:39.451
Not just closing my eyes for a second
while I'm doing a tracheotomy?

17:41.673 --> 17:43.719
I don't know. I slept for a
couple of hours on Monday night.

17:44.321 --> 17:46.041
-Jesus! Why aren't you at home, in bed?
-Would you cut it out?

17:46.102 --> 17:48.801
I'm going to take the kids to a movie.
This is a cinch.

17:49.050 --> 17:49.593
Annie?

17:50.017 --> 17:50.734
What?

17:51.531 --> 17:52.671
How could I not come?

17:55.072 --> 17:57.747
This thing today was the triumph
of your life, girlfriend.

17:59.775 --> 18:00.502
What?

18:02.930 --> 18:05.423
# You, you You did it #

18:07.601 --> 18:08.677
What did I do?

18:09.528 --> 18:11.985
You sold three goddamn pieces!

18:12.773 --> 18:13.706
You know what? I did!

18:19.322 --> 18:22.690
Laozi says that returning
is the movement of the Dao.

18:24.218 --> 18:25.343
So are you a Daoist?

18:26.207 --> 18:27.177
I don't know.

18:29.357 --> 18:32.066
Laozi says that when the foolish
man first hears of the Dao,

18:32.126 --> 18:33.301
he laughs out loud,

18:33.361 --> 18:35.214
which is certainly true
in my case, I'm afraid,

18:35.496 --> 18:37.712
but I also find it very compelling.

18:38.699 --> 18:42.276
Become a valley,
stop fighting against that structure

18:42.336 --> 18:44.939
against that fate, what have you,

18:45.992 --> 18:48.927
and everything will flow to you.

18:53.948 --> 18:54.948
What do you think?

18:56.984 --> 18:58.323
I think we need to take a left.

19:07.862 --> 19:10.396
-Should I just...
-Yeah, any one. It doesn't matter.

19:12.233 --> 19:13.541
Just like the ones in the gallery.

19:13.601 --> 19:15.600
You just stick your hand under and...

19:15.661 --> 19:16.989
Cop a feel, yeah.

19:21.142 --> 19:23.471
'The Dream of Giving Notice.'

19:35.046 --> 19:35.821
Hmm.

19:38.007 --> 19:39.188
What do you feel?

19:39.920 --> 19:40.920
A keyboard.

19:43.033 --> 19:46.761
A computer keyboard and
something rough on the keys.

19:46.822 --> 19:47.854
Is it sandpaper?

19:49.837 --> 19:50.911
This is...

19:50.971 --> 19:52.905
What is this? This is wire.

19:54.008 --> 19:55.430
This is a cage.

19:57.244 --> 19:58.527
This is a birdcage.

20:00.581 --> 20:02.548
I'm caught in a birdcage.

20:05.920 --> 20:07.290
The door is open, but I can't

20:08.272 --> 20:09.827
quite squeeze through.

20:12.470 --> 20:17.070
And now I feel a breeze on my
fingertips just beyond my reach.

20:17.131 --> 20:18.275
How did you do that?

20:22.565 --> 20:23.862
And now a fluttering...

20:26.207 --> 20:27.253
This is a bird.

20:29.080 --> 20:30.273
This is amazing.

20:32.877 --> 20:35.258
This is also a little bit strange. I mean,

20:35.660 --> 20:38.567
reaching up underneath
here and feeling your...

20:39.887 --> 20:40.887
Private stuff?

20:42.256 --> 20:43.143
Private stuff.

20:46.123 --> 20:47.145
My God!

20:48.128 --> 20:52.877
Annie, it doesn't have to only be a dream.
You can give notice.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.978
You can escape that hell.

20:55.228 --> 20:59.320
You can do nothing but just make
art for the rest of your life.

21:12.934 --> 21:14.302
Would you like to feel another one?

21:15.022 --> 21:17.376
There's a really good one
right over there.

21:27.839 --> 21:29.572
-This one?
-Yeah, that one.

21:31.633 --> 21:33.551
But I've already felt that one.

21:35.047 --> 21:37.648
No, no. That one's the one...
I just finished that one.

21:38.984 --> 21:40.843
Well, I felt it yesterday.

21:43.365 --> 21:45.085
Yesterday? I didn't even
know you yesterday.

21:47.406 --> 21:48.316
But I was here.

21:54.628 --> 21:55.647
You're kidding, right?

22:12.662 --> 22:13.340
Don't get up.

22:19.286 --> 22:20.716
Annie, listen to me now.

22:23.057 --> 22:25.799
You're in danger
and your son is in danger.

22:25.859 --> 22:27.339
Oliver. What do you mean? Where's my son?

22:27.417 --> 22:29.697
He went with Jesse and Juliet
to the movies, didn't he?

22:31.098 --> 22:32.377
He's gonna be all right.

22:34.268 --> 22:36.207
Such an extraordinary child.

22:36.968 --> 22:37.757
Remember last night,

22:37.818 --> 22:39.792
when the two of you were playing
that video game upstairs

22:39.853 --> 22:41.818
and you started to panic and he said,
'Chill out, Momba.'

22:41.918 --> 22:42.701
You remember that?

22:45.131 --> 22:46.197
How do you know that?

22:47.335 --> 22:48.036
Annie,

22:50.368 --> 22:53.517
when I heard the two of you,
together, laughing,

22:53.654 --> 22:55.930
I swore to myself
that I would do everything

22:55.990 --> 22:58.299
to make sure that he gets through this.

22:58.713 --> 22:59.900
Do you understand me, Annie?

22:59.960 --> 23:03.184
This is a very dangerous time for him.

23:03.766 --> 23:05.427
He could stray.

23:06.033 --> 23:09.468
He could commit some childish
error and we could lose him.

23:10.141 --> 23:10.797
That quick.

23:16.477 --> 23:17.324
But you know what I think?

23:18.545 --> 23:19.891
I think he's gonna be safe.

23:20.207 --> 23:22.219
I think he'll grow up
and he'll be healthy.

23:23.074 --> 23:25.740
And your friend, Juliet, she'll
be safe too. She'll be fine.

23:26.075 --> 23:29.820
Everyone you care about,
they'll all be safe as churches.

23:30.005 --> 23:31.083
Do you hear what I'm saying?

23:31.792 --> 23:32.403
Annie,

23:33.692 --> 23:35.481
nod your head now. Do as I say.

23:40.543 --> 23:41.805
And, as for you,

23:44.638 --> 23:46.027
all you have to do is wait.

23:47.634 --> 23:48.502
That's all.

23:48.965 --> 23:51.524
And then someone is going to contact you,

23:52.133 --> 23:54.554
and tell you to say two words.

23:54.877 --> 23:56.738
Two precisely.

23:57.334 --> 23:59.214
Do you know what they are?
Have you guessed yet?

24:00.533 --> 24:01.185
No.

24:06.794 --> 24:08.960
Not guilty.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.099
Okay, Annie's home.

24:31.085 --> 24:34.151
-Okay, brat, see you later.
-Okay, I'll see you later.

24:34.212 --> 24:35.126
Get out of here.

24:35.323 --> 24:36.471
What do you want me to do?

24:40.060 --> 24:40.879
Protect him.

24:43.897 --> 24:46.051
Tell him that your date
turned out to be a creep.

24:51.572 --> 24:52.215
Hey.

24:52.657 --> 24:53.881
Hi there.

24:54.842 --> 24:56.708
-Hey, you all right?
-Yeah.

24:57.845 --> 24:59.344
Oh, it's nice to see you.

25:01.715 --> 25:03.126
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

25:03.187 --> 25:04.962
-Did you have a good time?
-Yeah.

25:05.152 --> 25:06.862
-So what's the matter?
-Nothing, nothing.

25:07.488 --> 25:09.716
Things just didn't go great with that guy.

25:10.772 --> 25:12.942
-Is he still gonna buy your boxes?
-Doesn't matter.

25:15.252 --> 25:16.802
-Here.
-You okay?

25:16.863 --> 25:18.351
I am fine, sweetie. Go.

25:18.766 --> 25:20.011
I'll be up in a minute, all right.

25:21.969 --> 25:22.809
Just go on.

25:36.621 --> 25:38.196
I still wanna buy your boxes.

25:38.257 --> 25:40.032
No, I don't want you to buy my boxes.

25:40.287 --> 25:41.150
I insist.

25:42.062 --> 25:44.295
Annie, this will be over
before you know it.

26:14.822 --> 26:15.381
What?

26:15.647 --> 26:17.716
Annie. Hey, what's up?

26:18.820 --> 26:19.500
Boone?

26:19.560 --> 26:20.968
Yeah, it's me.

26:21.028 --> 26:22.536
Oh, Jesus. How are you?

26:22.596 --> 26:24.382
I'm good. How the hell are you?

26:24.498 --> 26:25.706
Hey, listen, don't go anywhere,

26:25.766 --> 26:27.297
I've to put money in the phone, okay?

26:27.803 --> 26:30.019
It's the 1950s here. Don't do anything.

26:30.080 --> 26:31.332
It's gonna sound like we're disconnected.

26:31.393 --> 26:32.237
Are you there?

26:32.506 --> 26:33.533
Yes, that's better.

26:33.594 --> 26:36.215
So, I brought one of the kids
down to the hospital today,

26:36.276 --> 26:38.252
and I just thought I'd
grab a chance to call you.

26:38.312 --> 26:40.120
How long has it been?
How long since we talked?

26:40.180 --> 26:43.267
Well, I don't know, probably the fall,
sometime in the fall.

26:43.534 --> 26:44.615
No, has it been...

26:45.440 --> 26:47.528
It's been that long. You
know, I've meaning to call,

26:47.697 --> 26:50.430
but I'm still three hours
from the nearest phone.

26:50.490 --> 26:51.578
It's just not that easy.

26:51.639 --> 26:53.674
How are you guys anyway? How's Oliver?

26:56.515 --> 26:58.782
-Annie? Are you there? Yeah?
-Um...

27:00.267 --> 27:01.480
Yeah,

27:02.730 --> 27:03.544
we're okay.

27:03.604 --> 27:04.878
Good. I thought I lost you.

27:04.938 --> 27:08.615
Listen, Annie,
book your airline early this time, okay?

27:08.675 --> 27:10.063
Because last time you know what happened.

27:10.124 --> 27:12.052
You know, I don't think we'll be able
to make it this summer. I'm sorry.

27:12.112 --> 27:13.404
You're not gonna make it?

27:13.465 --> 27:15.675
-Annie, you'll miss the fiesta. Why?
-Boone,

27:16.937 --> 27:19.770
you know, just because
we had a connection once,

27:19.831 --> 27:20.933
about a million years ago,

27:20.994 --> 27:23.136
doesn't mean that you can just
keep popping up into my life

27:23.197 --> 27:23.926
whenever you want.

27:24.371 --> 27:25.507
Annie, what's the matter?

27:26.101 --> 27:29.445
I have someone here and he
doesn't like these phone calls,

27:29.630 --> 27:30.967
and, frankly, neither do I.

27:31.819 --> 27:32.908
Okay. Uh...

27:34.701 --> 27:36.476
Sorry. I didn't know.

27:36.536 --> 27:37.397
You okay?

27:38.140 --> 27:41.241
Yeah. And I'll be great when
I can just get back to sleep.

27:57.076 --> 27:58.209
Good night, Annie.

28:09.202 --> 28:11.311
I'm talking to the Teacher
and he says to me,

28:11.371 --> 28:14.375
'Man don't want to come out of his house.
Man don't want to be killed.'

28:14.672 --> 28:15.403
So what?

28:16.206 --> 28:17.598
So we could dig a tunnel.

28:18.209 --> 28:19.343
You remember what he said to me, Paulie?

28:19.404 --> 28:20.871
I remember, Louie. I remember.

28:20.932 --> 28:24.660
And I say to the Teacher, I say,
'You wanna dig a tunnel?'

28:24.721 --> 28:28.546
'Okay, dig a tunnel.
Just kill that cocksucker.'

28:30.598 --> 28:31.840
Mr. DeCicco,

28:31.972 --> 28:33.786
that is you on the
prosecutions tape, isn't it?

28:33.847 --> 28:34.411
Yeah.

28:34.588 --> 28:37.400
It's you and Louie Boffano
talking about the Teacher.

28:37.885 --> 28:38.581
Yeah.

28:38.699 --> 28:39.931
So, who is this Teacher?

28:41.513 --> 28:42.091
I don't know.

28:42.152 --> 28:44.501
Do you know why he's called the Teacher,
Mr. DeCicco?

28:45.220 --> 28:46.649
'Cause when you see him, school's out.

28:50.010 --> 28:50.941
School's out.

28:51.421 --> 28:52.090
Meaning?

28:53.194 --> 28:54.464
What the fuck you think it means?

28:54.783 --> 28:55.708
Means you're dead.

28:56.173 --> 28:58.479
Mr. DeCicco, not here.

28:59.852 --> 29:00.187
-Sorry.

29:00.295 --> 29:02.415
Did you have any direct
dealings with this Teacher?

29:02.872 --> 29:05.314
No, nobody knows who he is.
He just does special jobs for Louie.

29:05.662 --> 29:08.301
But didn't you testify
yesterday under directive

29:08.362 --> 29:10.536
that the Teacher had suggested a strategy

29:10.597 --> 29:12.369
for negotiating with the Cali Drug Cartel.

29:12.899 --> 29:14.608
-Maybe, but he didn't...
-It was the Teacher

29:14.668 --> 29:18.075
who arranged the link between Louie
and the Calabrian Mafia, wasn't it?

29:19.071 --> 29:19.611
Yeah.

29:19.905 --> 29:22.664
Two alliances Salvador
Riggio bitterly opposed.

29:23.698 --> 29:24.268
Yeah.

29:24.543 --> 29:26.042
And then one day the Teacher said

29:26.103 --> 29:28.364
he could dig a tunnel to the
house of Salvador Riggio

29:28.425 --> 29:29.882
for the purpose of killing him, right?

29:30.905 --> 29:31.441
-Right.

29:31.714 --> 29:33.129
-And Louie Boffano said,

29:33.469 --> 29:34.619
'You wanna dig a tunnel.

29:34.959 --> 29:36.217
Okay, dig a tunnel.'

29:37.108 --> 29:37.600
Yeah.

29:38.076 --> 29:39.924
After all, the Teacher is the boss.

29:39.985 --> 29:41.044
He can do what he wants, right?

29:41.336 --> 29:43.690
Come on, give me a break.
Teacher's not the boss.

29:44.131 --> 29:45.981
You know of a single case
in which his counsel

29:46.042 --> 29:47.852
wasn't followed, Mr. DeCicco?

29:48.268 --> 29:50.944
I told you, Louie's the boss.
Louie gives the orders.

29:51.004 --> 29:54.328
You mean Louie seems
to give the orders, right?

29:54.769 --> 29:58.258
Mr. DeCicco, do you know what a puppet is?

29:58.319 --> 29:59.987
-Objection, Your Honour.
-Sustained.

30:00.047 --> 30:01.527
I'm sorry. Let me put it another way.

30:02.616 --> 30:03.825
This is a puppet.

30:04.451 --> 30:06.469
Maybe it seems to make its own decisions.

30:06.530 --> 30:07.734
Objection.

30:07.795 --> 30:09.460
Sustained. Mr. Bozeman,
this is not a circus.

30:09.575 --> 30:10.809
I withdraw the puppet.

30:10.981 --> 30:12.122
No further questions.

30:12.190 --> 30:14.133
The reporter will strike
that remark from the record.

30:14.194 --> 30:15.609
The jury will disregard it.

30:15.704 --> 30:18.704
Counsel, take that puppet and put it away.

30:18.765 --> 30:20.431
I just sustained an objection to it.

30:40.654 --> 30:41.586
Oliver?

30:42.767 --> 30:44.542
-Oliver?
-Yeah.

30:44.891 --> 30:46.423
Please get down here.

30:46.660 --> 30:47.757
Anybody here?

30:48.462 --> 30:50.281
-I was just playing around.
-Yeah, well,

30:50.664 --> 30:54.521
just take your costume off the kitchen
table and put it where it belongs.

30:55.735 --> 30:56.612
Mom...

30:56.815 --> 30:58.523
-Oliver...
-It was a joke.

30:58.638 --> 31:00.848
Well, I'm not the mood, okay?

31:05.946 --> 31:07.503
-What is it, Oliver?
-Mom...

31:17.023 --> 31:17.851
What is this?

31:18.291 --> 31:20.868
This is my math...

31:38.912 --> 31:41.888
You should just say something.
Even if it's just, 'Okay.'

31:41.948 --> 31:44.391
I got a 37 out of 100.

31:44.451 --> 31:46.617
I can see that.
What do you want me to say?

31:47.998 --> 31:49.151
What's this?

32:04.974 --> 32:06.830
I thought I told you never to come here.

32:08.103 --> 32:08.895
Well, I...

32:09.722 --> 32:11.172
You know, I need some help.

32:11.673 --> 32:14.709
Could I get a few bucks
on next month's rent? Huh?

32:14.770 --> 32:16.892
-What the fuck is this?
-Don't touch that!

32:21.535 --> 32:22.683
It's a piece of art.

32:23.404 --> 32:26.553
Rodney, it's a very delicate piece of art.

32:28.253 --> 32:30.770
There you go.
Here's somebody you have got to meet.

32:30.830 --> 32:32.749
You have got to meet Lorraine.

32:33.200 --> 32:34.766
This stuff isn't hard for you.

32:37.054 --> 32:38.442
Lorraine? Who's Lorraine?

32:39.526 --> 32:40.438
My girlfriend.

32:41.283 --> 32:42.878
What's this? More art?

32:46.744 --> 32:48.202
That's my girlfriend.

32:49.054 --> 32:51.177
And, yeah, it's a piece of art.
These are all...

32:52.061 --> 32:56.221
pieces of art. That's why I didn't want you
dropping by unexpectedly because I'm...

32:58.132 --> 33:00.267
working on some very important pieces.

33:00.327 --> 33:01.902
...who you are? What you do?

33:01.962 --> 33:03.528
Let me tell you this. Get the...

33:04.698 --> 33:05.674
Rodney?

33:07.497 --> 33:07.950
Yeah.

33:08.558 --> 33:10.296
Yeah, yeah. I'll see you later.

33:10.904 --> 33:12.316
Going to do better.

33:12.689 --> 33:14.906
You know, you've said that before.

33:16.329 --> 33:18.638
-Well, I mean it this time.
-Yeah, right.

33:18.699 --> 33:21.142
You know what?
I don't want to discuss this, okay?

33:24.184 --> 33:26.083
Just get your coat on and let's go.

33:26.686 --> 33:28.239
We don't have anything
to eat in this house.

33:45.105 --> 33:46.018
Hey, I know you.

33:47.125 --> 33:48.061
You're the..

33:48.441 --> 33:49.323
the artist, right?

33:49.689 --> 33:50.383
Box lady?

33:50.889 --> 33:53.013
Buddy of mine, Mark Cordell,
bought a couple of your pieces.

33:54.551 --> 33:55.437
This your kid?

33:57.435 --> 33:59.402
-Hey, how you doing? Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

34:01.588 --> 34:03.300
What were those frozen
things that you like?

34:05.348 --> 34:07.261
-You mean RoboPops?
-Yeah, go get some.

34:14.533 --> 34:16.312
Tomorrow morning, 7:00 a.m.

34:16.813 --> 34:18.121
The park and ride in Banktree.

34:18.338 --> 34:20.121
It's off I-684, you know it?

34:20.966 --> 34:21.581
Yes.

34:23.842 --> 34:24.755
What did I say?

34:25.779 --> 34:27.745
The park and ride, 684, in Banktree.

34:28.888 --> 34:29.688
What time?

34:29.748 --> 34:30.675
7:00 a.m.

34:32.422 --> 34:33.222
Look,

34:34.949 --> 34:35.728
you'll be fine.

34:36.889 --> 34:38.092
We're not animals.

34:38.746 --> 34:40.668
I got a kid, too, just a
little older than him.

34:41.428 --> 34:42.194
Teenager.

34:45.063 --> 34:47.371
Anyway, I just want to tell you I know
what you're going through, and...

34:47.797 --> 34:48.576
hang in there.

34:52.739 --> 34:53.346
Hey!

34:55.884 --> 34:56.641
What's your name?

35:02.748 --> 35:04.014
I can't tell you my name.

35:05.121 --> 35:06.239
What do I call you then?

35:07.654 --> 35:09.008
Call me Cap'n Crunch.

35:10.974 --> 35:11.743
Captain,

35:12.412 --> 35:13.158
thanks.

35:18.398 --> 35:19.774
How are you holding up, Annie?

35:21.401 --> 35:22.847
How have you been feeling lately?

35:24.489 --> 35:27.132
Why don't you tell me?
You listen to every word we say.

35:27.474 --> 35:29.340
I don't enjoy invading your privacy.

35:30.440 --> 35:31.193
You don't?

35:32.411 --> 35:32.982
No.

35:35.782 --> 35:38.532
But we can't afford the slightest error.

35:39.351 --> 35:41.427
Now, I'm gonna say something to
you that might be unwelcome,

35:41.488 --> 35:42.887
but I'm gonna say it nonetheless,

35:42.948 --> 35:44.842
I think you're being a little
harsh with your child.

35:46.659 --> 35:49.836
He may start to ask questions.
He may talk to his friends.

35:49.896 --> 35:50.995
He won't. He won't.

35:53.800 --> 35:57.800
I just want to finish this as quickly
and as painlessly as possible,

35:58.371 --> 36:00.310
but I'm gonna need your help.

36:01.354 --> 36:02.926
We have to work together, Annie.

36:03.952 --> 36:05.652
I'll do what I can, all right?

36:09.394 --> 36:11.911
Do you understand what our strategy
was in the courtroom yesterday?

36:11.972 --> 36:13.540
What was our strategy yesterday?

36:14.821 --> 36:16.563
Louie Boffano didn't order the killing.

36:16.623 --> 36:20.200
He's in the mob, maybe a bad guy,
but just a figurehead.

36:20.260 --> 36:21.350
He doesn't give orders.

36:22.828 --> 36:23.497
That's right.

36:24.932 --> 36:26.878
And if Louie Boffano isn't guilty,

36:27.685 --> 36:28.636
then who is?

36:29.038 --> 36:30.756
Who did kill Salvador Riggio?

36:34.516 --> 36:35.174
You did.

36:44.184 --> 36:45.950
You think I'm the Teacher, Annie?

36:48.188 --> 36:49.041
Aren't you?

36:52.058 --> 36:53.434
I would have you believe that.

36:56.285 --> 36:58.248
The Teacher scares you, doesn't he, Annie?

37:00.400 --> 37:01.875
Well, I'm sorry for the fear.

37:01.935 --> 37:03.295
If I had any choice...

37:05.238 --> 37:06.352
Any choice...

37:07.540 --> 37:08.106
But

37:11.344 --> 37:12.718
if I can keep you scared,

37:14.113 --> 37:15.423
I can save your life.

37:20.565 --> 37:23.609
Then he got down on the bed
between my husband and me.

37:23.924 --> 37:26.739
And he put his gun on Sal, on his mouth.

37:27.079 --> 37:29.277
And what did the man do then, Mrs. Riggio?

37:29.338 --> 37:31.905
He said, 'Open up, Sal,
I don't wanna make a mess.'

37:32.355 --> 37:33.654
'I don't wanna scare your wife.'

37:34.780 --> 37:36.542
'We gotta work together, Sal.'

37:37.690 --> 37:38.359
And then?

37:38.692 --> 37:39.917
Then he killed my husband.

37:40.356 --> 37:41.922
He killed my Sal. Shot him.

37:43.877 --> 37:45.214
And what happened next?

37:45.678 --> 37:47.812
Then the door opened and my...

37:51.684 --> 37:52.529
Mrs. Riggio,

37:53.670 --> 37:55.114
did someone come in?

37:57.605 --> 37:58.223
Tommy,

37:59.897 --> 38:00.832
my grandson.

38:01.609 --> 38:02.641
He came in the room,

38:03.897 --> 38:05.538
and he saw my Sal dead.

38:05.699 --> 38:06.738
And then what happened?

38:07.367 --> 38:08.226
Then the man,

38:09.054 --> 38:10.054
he saw my baby.

38:10.904 --> 38:13.179
And Tommy ran away, he ran down the hall.

38:13.239 --> 38:14.461
He ran after him.

38:16.943 --> 38:18.288
Then I heard the shot.

38:20.346 --> 38:21.922
He killed my baby!

38:30.744 --> 38:31.909
No further questions.

38:46.906 --> 38:48.471
-Oliver?
-Yeah.

38:49.409 --> 38:51.318
Mom, Juliet called again.

38:51.477 --> 38:53.023
It's only, like, the tenth time.

38:55.081 --> 38:56.055
What's he doing here?

38:56.602 --> 38:57.724
What do you mean? Jesse?

38:57.784 --> 38:58.983
You're supposed to be doing your homework.

38:59.452 --> 39:00.442
Bye, Jesse.

39:01.020 --> 39:02.015
See you later.

39:03.666 --> 39:05.896
Who the hell has been
cutting into the newspaper?

39:07.088 --> 39:07.791
I did.

39:08.135 --> 39:09.326
You told me to.

39:10.773 --> 39:12.704
You know what?
You never do anything that I ask you to.

39:12.765 --> 39:14.310
Why the hell did you have to do this?

39:15.234 --> 39:16.424
'Cause you told me to!

39:18.137 --> 39:19.095
What did it say?

39:19.505 --> 39:21.143
You're not supposed to know what it says.

39:22.075 --> 39:25.095
You said you weren't supposed to
know what's in the paper or on TV.

39:25.911 --> 39:26.763
That's not right.

39:27.880 --> 39:30.573
You don't tell me what's right and wrong,
you got it?

39:31.088 --> 39:33.526
-Now, what the hell did it say?
-I don't know.

39:33.671 --> 39:35.307
Well, did it say Boffano was guilty?

39:36.293 --> 39:38.135
-I don't know!
-What did it say?

39:38.196 --> 39:40.632
Was it compelling evidence,
persuasive evidence,

39:40.693 --> 39:42.150
do they want you to think he's guilty?

39:42.211 --> 39:43.859
Mom, everybody knows he's guilty.

39:44.664 --> 39:45.551
What's the matter?

39:48.501 --> 39:49.909
What do you mean everybody?

39:50.436 --> 39:51.678
Who the hell have you been talking to?

39:51.738 --> 39:53.310
Nobody. You asked me not to.

39:53.371 --> 39:55.413
No. I am not asking you, I am telling you.

39:55.474 --> 39:56.916
You talk to anybody about this trial,

39:56.977 --> 39:59.331
and I swear to God,
I will beat the shit out of you.

39:59.612 --> 40:00.947
Do you understand me?

40:01.395 --> 40:02.174
Do you?

40:02.434 --> 40:03.134
Yeah.

40:05.823 --> 40:08.814
And that bullshit crybaby
stuff stops right now!

40:14.994 --> 40:15.880
Oh, shit.

40:19.092 --> 40:19.872
Oh, I can't...

40:20.740 --> 40:21.815
I can't do this.

40:32.879 --> 40:34.599
Where is everybody? Huh?

40:35.074 --> 40:37.374
Did I get this wrong again? Oh, jeez.

40:39.152 --> 40:40.964
What do you mean?
What time are you supposed to be here?

40:41.244 --> 40:42.822
I was supposed to be here now.

40:45.194 --> 40:48.504
You know what? I'm gonna go see if they're
in the old practice fields. Hold on.

40:48.728 --> 40:50.203
-Oliver!
-Just hold on!

40:50.263 --> 40:53.106
Get back here!
Oliver, I don't want you going!

40:53.212 --> 40:54.212
Just stay there!

40:58.283 --> 40:59.162
Hey.

41:00.652 --> 41:01.490
We need to talk.

41:01.788 --> 41:04.767
I have to go. I'm gonna be late. And I...

41:04.992 --> 41:05.665
Walk with me.

41:06.308 --> 41:08.168
-I can't.
-What if I were in trouble?

41:09.949 --> 41:11.502
-What kind of trouble?
-What if I...

41:12.502 --> 41:13.791
were in really bad trouble?

41:14.574 --> 41:17.417
What is it? Like a man, or work?
What is it?

41:17.797 --> 41:19.093
What if I couldn't tell you?

41:19.726 --> 41:20.867
What do you mean,
'If you couldn't tell me?'

41:20.927 --> 41:23.024
I'm your best friend.
You've got to tell me.

41:23.171 --> 41:25.182
-So you would tell me?
-Of course.

41:26.065 --> 41:26.874
Then do that.

41:31.086 --> 41:33.530
I can't tell you what to do,
Annie, I don't have a kid.

41:34.183 --> 41:36.750
Still you love him. You
love him as much as I do.

41:36.879 --> 41:37.688
Don't you?

41:38.311 --> 41:40.044
Tell me what to do, Juliet.

41:42.527 --> 41:44.050
I think you've got to go to the judge.

41:45.076 --> 41:46.295
You're gonna go to the judge,

41:47.403 --> 41:49.318
you're gonna tell him
that your son got sick.

41:50.823 --> 41:52.932
Tell him that your son just
got diagnosed with leukaemia.

41:52.976 --> 41:54.883
-He's not gonna buy that.
-Yeah, he will.

41:57.035 --> 41:58.723
If you have a note from your doctor.

41:59.559 --> 42:00.316
From me.

42:00.812 --> 42:01.514
Okay?

42:04.540 --> 42:05.700
I don't know.

42:07.874 --> 42:09.673
I don't know. It just...

42:10.000 --> 42:11.397
sounds sort of crazy.

42:11.458 --> 42:13.684
You're right. What you're doing,
the way you're handling it,

42:13.745 --> 42:15.754
going along with these guys.
It's much smarter.

42:16.449 --> 42:19.336
-Then why did you...
-Because I don't take orders very well.

42:20.453 --> 42:22.971
From monsters, I don't take them at all.
But that's just me.

42:24.937 --> 42:25.937
He's your kid, Annie.

42:39.906 --> 42:41.093
Once we're back in the car,

42:41.874 --> 42:43.342
you never talk about this.

42:43.661 --> 42:44.269
Okay?

42:45.107 --> 42:46.782
Not a word, not a question.

42:47.046 --> 42:49.167
Say it. Say, 'I'll never
talk about this in the car.'

42:51.258 --> 42:52.791
I'll never talk about this in the car.

42:52.852 --> 42:53.744
'Or in the house.'

42:54.554 --> 42:55.585
Or in the house.

42:59.058 --> 42:59.878
I knew it.

43:00.426 --> 43:01.911
-Oh, God.
-You're just too smart.

43:05.865 --> 43:07.507
I'm glad you figured it out.

43:09.436 --> 43:11.526
And I'm glad you went to Juliet.

43:13.673 --> 43:14.512
Are you scared?

43:15.512 --> 43:16.061
Yeah.

43:16.340 --> 43:17.405
Just a little.

43:18.778 --> 43:20.999
But we're gonna turn this thing around,
okay?

43:21.236 --> 43:21.951
Yeah.

43:44.037 --> 43:45.818
Excuse me, may I help you?

43:46.627 --> 43:48.854
I just need to see the judge.

43:53.880 --> 43:55.102
What are you doing here?

43:56.100 --> 43:57.169
I need to see you.

43:58.493 --> 43:59.638
You know who I am.

44:00.286 --> 44:01.668
Yes, you're a juror.

44:01.821 --> 44:03.049
Open that door, please.

44:03.110 --> 44:04.955
I wanna talk to you alone.

44:05.297 --> 44:07.653
Let me just explain something to you.

44:08.173 --> 44:11.182
When you come into my chambers,
this is not a trivial thing.

44:11.864 --> 44:13.588
When a juror visits a judge,

44:14.133 --> 44:16.084
this can have serious consequences.

44:17.734 --> 44:18.664
Now,

44:19.640 --> 44:21.851
if you still have a problem and you...

44:22.220 --> 44:23.677
wanna talk about it,

44:24.150 --> 44:26.651
then I'll call the Defence Attorney and
the DA and we'll sit down and talk...

44:26.712 --> 44:28.432
No, I wanna talk to you alone.

44:28.493 --> 44:31.245
I don't want them.
I only wanna talk to you.

44:32.518 --> 44:34.266
-Alone?
-Alone.

44:34.520 --> 44:36.896
Well, you can't talk to me
alone and whatever that is,

44:36.956 --> 44:39.508
I don't wanna see it.
Not without the attorneys present.

44:45.246 --> 44:47.131
Are you telling me
that I'm making a mistake?

44:51.354 --> 44:51.843
Madam,

44:52.675 --> 44:54.557
what I remember about you

44:54.799 --> 44:56.759
is that I gave you every opportunity

44:56.820 --> 44:58.705
to get out of serving on this jury.

44:59.045 --> 45:00.146
But you insisted

45:00.290 --> 45:02.677
you wanted jury duty. Do you recall?

45:03.576 --> 45:06.186
Well, you want to serve,
you don't want to serve.

45:06.419 --> 45:07.468
You have a problem,

45:07.529 --> 45:10.008
but you don't think the defendant
has a right to hear it.

45:10.856 --> 45:11.683
Well, I think

45:12.091 --> 45:12.965
you're wrong.

45:13.859 --> 45:16.159
He happens to be on trial for murder.

45:17.306 --> 45:19.141
He was every right to hear it.

45:20.032 --> 45:20.770
Now,

45:23.736 --> 45:25.287
shall I try to locate his counsel?

45:25.805 --> 45:26.439
No,

45:27.199 --> 45:28.399
I've changed my mind.

46:08.300 --> 46:10.842
You and your fucking '77 Knicks.

46:11.070 --> 46:14.744
You think your fucking Earl 'The Pearl,'
could play John Starks?

46:14.805 --> 46:17.573
Hey, man, Earl 'The Pearl'
would've blown fucking John Starks

46:17.656 --> 46:19.616
right out of the Garden, my friend.

46:19.677 --> 46:22.226
John Starks would take Earl 'The Pearl...'

46:22.414 --> 46:23.442
Annie,

46:24.121 --> 46:25.264
I'd like you to meet Rodney.

46:25.325 --> 46:27.084
Rodney, this is my friend, Annie.

46:27.199 --> 46:29.687
Your girl is a fucking knock-out.

46:29.898 --> 46:32.097
Rodney, here, is about
a half a gallon of sewage

46:32.158 --> 46:33.657
that just backed up
from New York City, Annie.

46:33.718 --> 46:35.689
Hey, don't give me that shit!

46:36.742 --> 46:38.117
I offered to drive Rodney home because

46:38.177 --> 46:39.952
I think he's had a little bit
too much to drink.

46:40.012 --> 46:40.810
Well...

46:41.619 --> 46:42.272
Annie,

46:42.684 --> 46:43.836
would you like to ride with us?

46:44.703 --> 46:45.725
Shove it up your ass.

46:45.785 --> 46:48.027
-I'll drive my own car.
-Hey, man, get in the car.

46:48.088 --> 46:49.382
Come on.
I want you to get into the back seat,

46:49.443 --> 46:51.170
'cause I want Annie to
ride up front with me.

46:52.858 --> 46:56.912
Rodney is not making a great success
in his sojourn here on earth.

46:57.296 --> 46:59.572
He's a drunk, he's an imbecile.

46:59.632 --> 47:01.799
You button up that bum hole, buddy.

47:02.368 --> 47:04.377
But his friends take good care of him.

47:04.437 --> 47:06.405
Even after all those DUIs...

47:06.772 --> 47:08.592
...he's still on the road.

47:09.108 --> 47:11.661
Hey, you said you had some scotch, right?

47:11.835 --> 47:13.713
Break it out, shit-for-brains.

47:13.932 --> 47:17.312
Annie, could you reach into my bag and
take out the bottle that's in there?

47:22.788 --> 47:24.385
-This?
-Yeah, that's it.

47:24.657 --> 47:25.962
I don't want you to spill any, Rodney.

47:26.023 --> 47:28.634
What do you think? I'm gonna
stick this in my face?

47:28.694 --> 47:29.781
Just suck on it.

47:29.842 --> 47:32.580
If you think it's gonna affect
my high regard for you, Rodney,

47:32.641 --> 47:33.492
well, it won't.

47:33.966 --> 47:35.113
You ass hole.

47:37.219 --> 47:38.251
Just lie down, Rodney.

47:38.610 --> 47:40.846
I've put something in
there to make you sleepy.

47:41.130 --> 47:42.364
So go to sleep.

47:42.942 --> 47:43.842
Go to sleep.

47:45.945 --> 47:48.431
-What are you doing?
-I'm doing Rodney.

47:49.758 --> 47:53.534
I wanna see what life is like
through Rodney's eyes.

47:54.386 --> 47:58.608
And just like I thought,
it is one big blur.

48:05.690 --> 48:07.657
Look at Rodney now, Annie, look at him.

48:08.321 --> 48:09.952
He's just like the rest of us.

48:10.143 --> 48:14.454
Spending all of his time trying
to stay out of the way of fear.

48:14.748 --> 48:17.707
Anything to not feel fear. Anything.

48:18.761 --> 48:20.227
Don't you ever feel fear?

48:20.575 --> 48:22.083
I feel it all the time, Annie.

48:22.214 --> 48:23.900
I had a bout with it today.

48:24.121 --> 48:25.199
But you know, Annie,

48:25.476 --> 48:26.569
I bow to fear.

48:26.952 --> 48:29.467
It's terror that teaches me my shape,
Annie.

48:30.629 --> 48:31.726
Do you understand what I'm saying?

48:37.826 --> 48:38.802
Lacrosse.

48:39.524 --> 48:42.400
They say it's the most
dangerous sport in the country,

48:42.593 --> 48:45.453
but I guess if it weren't
very dangerous, then...

48:46.002 --> 48:48.321
young boys wouldn't
wanna play, would they?

48:48.784 --> 48:50.514
Oliver plays lacrosse, doesn't he?

48:51.810 --> 48:52.855
What are we doing here?

48:53.312 --> 48:55.485
I wanna teach you what you love, Annie.

48:56.007 --> 48:58.442
The grey suits want you to love the law,

48:58.994 --> 48:59.968
justice,

49:01.153 --> 49:03.138
but what good are the grey suits?

49:03.820 --> 49:05.335
Are they gonna shield you?

49:05.589 --> 49:07.611
Are the grey suits
gonna shield you, Annie?

49:09.386 --> 49:13.447
Can the grey suits shield you
from somebody like me?

49:13.632 --> 49:15.464
I mean, look at me!

49:15.758 --> 49:19.705
I'm Rodney. I'm old, and I'm tired,

49:20.639 --> 49:22.783
but when I'm behind the wheel of this car,

49:23.262 --> 49:24.550
I'm a young buck again.

49:24.610 --> 49:26.859
I might take this curve
here a little too fast.

49:31.717 --> 49:32.675
Please stop!

49:34.520 --> 49:37.497
Look, I didn't tell the judge, I swear!
I did not tell the judge.

49:37.690 --> 49:38.802
I didn't tell him!

49:39.827 --> 49:42.767
-Aw! Who's gonna protect you, Annie?
-You will.

49:42.828 --> 49:44.537
-Who's gonna protect you?
-You will.

49:44.597 --> 49:46.739
And I want you to say it!
'The Teacher will protect me!'

49:46.799 --> 49:48.073
The Teacher will protect me!

49:48.133 --> 49:50.259
-Say it!
-The Teacher will protect me!

49:51.095 --> 49:53.807
-Say it again!
-The Teacher will protect me!

49:54.673 --> 49:58.629
Sure, you can put the Teacher in jail,
you can sizzle Louie Boffano,

49:59.078 --> 50:01.854
but what are you gonna do
about this drunken Rodney

50:01.914 --> 50:03.856
behind the wheel of this car?

50:03.955 --> 50:08.724
I'm looking down this road and
it's just one big blur to me!

50:11.223 --> 50:13.132
But I think I see a boy on a bicycle

50:13.192 --> 50:16.132
who looks an awful lot to me like... Hey.

50:17.463 --> 50:18.674
Oh, God, no!

50:18.897 --> 50:20.728
No! Oh, God! Please no!

50:20.789 --> 50:22.540
-Who will protect you?
-Please, no!

50:22.601 --> 50:24.076
-The Teacher!
-Who will protect you?

50:24.136 --> 50:25.767
-The Teacher!
-Who will shield you?

50:25.828 --> 50:27.228
-Say, 'The Teacher!'
-The Teacher!

50:28.404 --> 50:30.480
-Say it, 'The Teacher will protect me!'
-The Teacher!

50:30.743 --> 50:33.910
-Say it! Again! Again! Again!
-The Teacher will protect me!

50:34.780 --> 50:35.474
No!

50:56.101 --> 50:56.970
Here.

51:02.121 --> 51:02.858
Oh.

51:09.315 --> 51:10.890
You can't let him drive like that!

51:11.887 --> 51:13.153
You're absolutely right, Annie.

51:14.148 --> 51:15.549
He could hurt somebody.

51:20.364 --> 51:20.995
No!

51:32.571 --> 51:34.011
Make sure she gets home safe, Eddie.

51:37.443 --> 51:38.390
Where you going?

51:50.208 --> 51:51.444
Why did he do that?

51:53.988 --> 51:55.092
'Cause you scared him.

51:55.668 --> 51:58.188
You don't ever wanna do that shit again
'cause he will hurt you.

52:00.312 --> 52:01.489
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

52:03.974 --> 52:05.674
You said you had a kid, right, captain?

52:06.472 --> 52:07.089
Eddie.

52:08.307 --> 52:09.260
My name is Eddie.

52:10.402 --> 52:11.948
Yeah, I got a daughter. 14.

52:14.546 --> 52:16.142
Why do you let him do these things?

52:19.351 --> 52:21.154
You got too many questions. Come on.

52:21.453 --> 52:22.514
Let's get out of here.

52:34.161 --> 52:34.911
Hey, Mom.

52:36.689 --> 52:38.501
Do you think we could
go to the mall later?

52:38.562 --> 52:39.176
No.

52:40.739 --> 52:41.693
Get some ice cream?

52:42.274 --> 52:42.886
No.

52:45.511 --> 52:47.751
I wanted to tell you about my day.

52:49.489 --> 52:50.962
Did you talk to Juliet today?

52:53.996 --> 52:56.597
Juliet? No.
Why don't you finish your homework?

54:24.476 --> 54:25.930
Did you talk to Juliet today?

54:32.561 --> 54:34.023
Did you talk to Juliet today?

54:35.854 --> 54:38.184
Juliet? No.
Why don't you finish your homework?

54:55.440 --> 54:56.614
He looks good.

54:56.675 --> 54:58.918
-You gonna examine me like that sometime?
-Oh, you wish.

54:58.979 --> 55:00.802
You're on call on Saturday night.

55:07.915 --> 55:09.235
You said he can be reasoned with.

55:13.800 --> 55:14.696
But he can't.

55:15.727 --> 55:16.538
What happened?

55:16.760 --> 55:18.470
We tried it your way, Juliet.

55:18.530 --> 55:19.834
And it didn't work out.

55:22.701 --> 55:23.909
Now, you've got to promise me

55:23.969 --> 55:25.788
that you're gonna stay out of our lives.

55:26.371 --> 55:27.857
And that's what Oliver wants, too?

55:28.445 --> 55:30.502
Well, Oliver thinks that
we should be heroes,

55:31.220 --> 55:31.947
but he's wrong.

55:33.809 --> 55:36.572
But he's promised to keep his mouth
shut so that's all that matters.

55:37.616 --> 55:39.187
And now you've got to promise, too.

55:39.312 --> 55:41.349
Promise you what?
I'm going to abandon you?

55:41.771 --> 55:44.360
That you're gonna keep your mouth
shut and stay out of our lives.

55:47.251 --> 55:48.407
It's my life, right?

55:48.827 --> 55:50.666
Isn't that what you said? My life, my kid?

55:55.000 --> 55:56.181
-Right?
-Yeah.

55:57.533 --> 55:58.288
Promise me.

56:03.845 --> 56:04.847
I promise you.

56:14.365 --> 56:15.271
Hey, Oliver.

56:16.650 --> 56:17.432
Hi, Annie.

56:22.427 --> 56:24.197
-Oliver...
-Puberty.

56:44.816 --> 56:45.538
Okay.

56:46.071 --> 56:47.043
'Guilty.'

56:47.886 --> 56:48.502
'Guilty.'

56:50.131 --> 56:50.969
'Guilty.'

56:55.379 --> 56:56.078
'Not guilty.'

56:56.635 --> 56:57.402
What?

56:57.462 --> 56:59.137
That's what it says. Calm down.

57:00.616 --> 57:01.342
'Guilty.'

57:03.561 --> 57:04.513
'Guilty.'

57:06.225 --> 57:07.012
'Guilty.'

57:08.507 --> 57:09.269
'Guilty.'

57:11.877 --> 57:12.699
'Guilty.'

57:15.280 --> 57:16.165
'Guilty.'

57:18.316 --> 57:19.057
'Guilty.'

57:22.474 --> 57:23.288
'Not guilty.'

57:24.256 --> 57:26.365
-Two...
-So we have 10 guiltys

57:26.426 --> 57:27.910
and two not guiltys.

57:27.971 --> 57:28.607
Wait a minute.

57:29.023 --> 57:31.916
I mean, I'm sorry, but how can
anybody think this guy is not guilty?

57:32.435 --> 57:34.872
I mean, who voted not guilty? Can I ask?

57:34.963 --> 57:37.600
You can ask, but nobody has
to say if they don't want to.

57:38.804 --> 57:41.103
-I voted not guilty.
-You did? Why?

57:41.432 --> 57:43.613
I don't think the
government proved its case.

57:43.766 --> 57:45.641
-Guys, guys, come on.
-'Proved?' It's open and shut.

57:45.944 --> 57:47.156
So you say.

57:47.524 --> 57:47.974
I mean,

57:48.663 --> 57:50.692
we have the tape, right?
Did you hear the tape?

57:51.036 --> 57:51.957
So you say.

57:52.514 --> 57:54.191
Roland, you're gonna drive me nuts.

57:54.252 --> 57:56.391
Look, suppose they were all lying,
all the witnesses.

57:56.488 --> 57:58.530
The cop, the mule, DeCicco.

57:58.590 --> 58:00.215
We still got the goddamn tape.

58:00.592 --> 58:03.687
I mean, it's on the tape that he says...
What is it about the tunnel?

58:04.161 --> 58:06.237
-Yeah.
-I says to the Teacher, I says,

58:06.298 --> 58:07.659
'You wanna dig a tunnel,

58:07.723 --> 58:08.723
dig a tunnel,

58:08.784 --> 58:10.408
kill that cocksucker.'

58:11.314 --> 58:13.219
I mean, you think he's talking
about the Tunnel of Love?

58:14.885 --> 58:15.765
Hold on.

58:17.175 --> 58:18.622
Don't tell me you're the other one.

58:19.804 --> 58:20.664
For Christ's sakes.

58:20.813 --> 58:21.450
Look,

58:22.030 --> 58:25.005
that tape, I mean, does
that prove anything?

58:26.705 --> 58:28.614
-I mean, it wasn't a direct order.
-Right.

58:28.674 --> 58:29.657
'Kill that cocksucker.'

58:30.126 --> 58:31.143
That's not a direct order?

58:31.323 --> 58:32.669
Come on, he could've just...

58:33.107 --> 58:35.067
-been bragging.
-He was bragging.

58:35.127 --> 58:37.733
He was bragging how he'd send
a hit man to kill Riggio.

58:39.865 --> 58:42.846
You know, maybe it's not fair
to pick on the not guiltys.

58:43.368 --> 58:46.611
You know, maybe we should have
to explain our case. You know?

58:46.671 --> 58:48.747
What's our evidence?
Let's start with that.

58:48.807 --> 58:49.902
This is ridiculous.

58:50.039 --> 58:52.400
Man, come on, sit down. It's the process.

58:52.461 --> 58:54.423
We're gonna be stuck in
that motel for weeks.

58:54.980 --> 58:56.488
Despite substantial evidence

58:56.548 --> 58:59.187
in the State's case against mob boss,
Louie Boffano,

58:59.529 --> 59:02.661
speculation turns toward the
possibility of a hung jury

59:02.721 --> 59:05.038
as deliberations move into the third day.

59:05.348 --> 59:06.153
In other news...

59:25.727 --> 59:28.278
I wanna know why you're not
leaning on the union guy.

59:28.814 --> 59:30.087
It's making me nervous.

59:30.888 --> 59:33.116
Because he's not powerful enough.
That's why.

59:33.411 --> 59:34.422
Oh, is that right?

59:35.140 --> 59:38.599
So this artist broad,
she's the one with the power now, huh?

59:38.970 --> 59:40.077
We hope so, yeah.

59:41.082 --> 59:42.220
Well, you know what I think?

59:42.594 --> 59:44.184
I wanna go with the union guy.

59:44.296 --> 59:45.668
And when my father's away,

59:45.832 --> 59:46.838
I'm the boss of this family,

59:46.898 --> 59:49.250
so I think you'd better listen
to what I'm telling you, okay?

59:50.001 --> 59:50.820
Let's go.

59:52.504 --> 59:54.172
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

59:55.441 --> 59:56.183
Joseph.

59:58.877 --> 01:00:00.552
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:00:00.674 --> 01:00:01.330
Whoa!

01:00:01.934 --> 01:00:03.044
Go back to the car.

01:00:04.516 --> 01:00:06.023
Let me ask you something.

01:00:06.885 --> 01:00:09.086
Do you take money from my family?

01:00:09.321 --> 01:00:10.923
I take a great deal
of money from your family,

01:00:10.984 --> 01:00:13.115
but that doesn't make you in charge.
I mean,

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.292
Joseph,

01:00:15.283 --> 01:00:16.825
your father knows what's going on.

01:00:20.305 --> 01:00:22.325
I don't like you, okay?

01:00:23.235 --> 01:00:25.009
I don't like what you're
doing to my family,

01:00:25.498 --> 01:00:28.479
I don't like the shit you're getting
us into with these Cali ass holes,

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:30.518
these fucking guys from Calabria!

01:00:38.764 --> 01:00:42.162
You act like you're some fancy,
sweet-smelling piece of shit.

01:00:43.421 --> 01:00:45.265
You're from the same
neighbourhood that I'm from,

01:00:45.831 --> 01:00:47.070
that my father's from.

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:49.464
You know what I think?

01:00:50.254 --> 01:00:51.696
I think you're just a sick fuck.

01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:53.751
I know you're a friendless fuck.

01:00:53.998 --> 01:00:56.225
You always was,
even when you was a little kid.

01:00:56.455 --> 01:00:57.303
Even Eddie.

01:00:57.824 --> 01:00:58.657
He thought you were smart,

01:00:58.718 --> 01:01:00.407
he brought you into the
family, but even him,

01:01:01.018 --> 01:01:01.799
he don't like you.

01:01:03.775 --> 01:01:04.794
Nobody likes you.

01:01:07.161 --> 01:01:08.118
Come on.

01:01:10.082 --> 01:01:11.071
I got work to do.

01:01:11.883 --> 01:01:13.516
Hey, listen to me!

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:16.370
Go with that union guy.

01:01:33.571 --> 01:01:36.114
-Hello?
-When your room mate falls asleep again,

01:01:36.174 --> 01:01:39.509
come out to the balcony and
slide the door shut behind you.

01:01:52.590 --> 01:01:53.391
Annie.

01:01:54.359 --> 01:01:55.040
Come here.

01:01:59.898 --> 01:02:03.555
I want you to take this and stand
over there and pretend to be smoking.

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.283
It's risky to talk but I
wanted you to know, Annie,

01:02:11.343 --> 01:02:13.350
that you're never out of my thoughts.

01:02:16.247 --> 01:02:17.016
Will we win?

01:02:18.883 --> 01:02:19.452
No.

01:02:19.921 --> 01:02:20.491
Why not?

01:02:21.297 --> 01:02:21.955
He's guilty.

01:02:23.834 --> 01:02:25.192
The others, they know it.

01:02:26.124 --> 01:02:26.792
Annie,

01:02:27.448 --> 01:02:30.101
if the jury hangs, if there's a mistrial,

01:02:30.161 --> 01:02:33.459
then the people I work for,
they will hurt you just to punish me.

01:02:34.372 --> 01:02:35.186
Hold on a second.

01:02:35.667 --> 01:02:36.847
That's not part of the deal.

01:02:37.035 --> 01:02:38.674
I thought if I kept voting not guilty...

01:02:38.735 --> 01:02:40.827
No, no, we have to have an acquittal.

01:02:42.195 --> 01:02:44.393
Do you understand?
We have to win this thing.

01:02:47.912 --> 01:02:48.987
You're out of your mind.

01:02:49.047 --> 01:02:51.019
Annie, that's why I chose you.

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:54.324
I chose you over all of the other
jurors because I know who you are

01:02:54.486 --> 01:02:56.861
-when you wake up.
-Look, I can't turn black into white.

01:02:56.921 --> 01:02:59.698
Louie Boffano could not
possibly have done this.

01:02:59.758 --> 01:03:01.766
You have to teach them that.
He doesn't have the brains,

01:03:01.826 --> 01:03:04.849
he doesn't have the courage,
he's a clown, he's disposable.

01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:06.839
But you, on the other hand,

01:03:07.168 --> 01:03:09.235
can do what I'm asking you to do

01:03:09.296 --> 01:03:10.619
because you have the spine.

01:03:13.271 --> 01:03:15.172
That's what you and I have in common.

01:03:16.305 --> 01:03:17.497
We're artists.

01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:20.463
We're intelligent. We have passion.

01:03:20.524 --> 01:03:23.048
But Louie Boffano? Please.

01:03:23.659 --> 01:03:24.923
It just isn't possible.

01:03:24.983 --> 01:03:26.358
What do you want me to do? Threaten them?

01:03:26.418 --> 01:03:28.493
The jury is afraid.

01:03:28.553 --> 01:03:30.502
They're instinct is to acquit.

01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:34.032
They're just waiting for somebody
like you to march in there

01:03:34.092 --> 01:03:36.062
and give them the excuse to do it.

01:03:41.433 --> 01:03:42.044
I can't.

01:03:45.268 --> 01:03:45.996
You will.

01:03:50.563 --> 01:03:51.681
I got you something.

01:03:55.914 --> 01:03:57.134
And I want you to wear it.

01:04:01.992 --> 01:04:02.679
Please take it.

01:04:08.175 --> 01:04:09.276
Don't worry.

01:04:10.195 --> 01:04:12.046
I'll be with you every step of the way.

01:04:19.749 --> 01:04:22.347
You're being completely unreasonable.

01:04:22.722 --> 01:04:24.815
Two people testified against the Teacher.

01:04:24.876 --> 01:04:26.613
They talk about him on the tape!

01:04:26.757 --> 01:04:28.632
How can you admit he didn't even exist?

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.288
I don't know who he is!

01:04:30.348 --> 01:04:31.794
It doesn't matter who he is!

01:04:31.855 --> 01:04:34.384
The only thing that matters is
you know how powerful he is.

01:04:34.552 --> 01:04:36.728
Can't you see that?
Didn't that get through to you?

01:04:36.788 --> 01:04:37.475
Annie.

01:04:38.013 --> 01:04:38.780
What?

01:04:39.413 --> 01:04:41.314
There's no need to raise your voice here.

01:04:41.825 --> 01:04:42.580
Sorry.

01:04:43.797 --> 01:04:45.872
What, are you crazy? Kayaking?

01:04:45.933 --> 01:04:48.596
Well, actually,
what I love the most is ocean kayaking.

01:04:49.134 --> 01:04:51.488
Like down South at night.

01:04:52.511 --> 01:04:54.835
You know,
there's this phosphor in the water...

01:04:55.310 --> 01:04:57.086
-What would you like?
-Fruit punch.

01:04:57.295 --> 01:04:58.100
And it's like...

01:04:59.344 --> 01:05:00.553
Thanks. It's, like,

01:05:01.991 --> 01:05:03.254
lit, you know?

01:05:03.314 --> 01:05:04.622
-It's beautiful, it's amazing.
-Really?

01:05:04.682 --> 01:05:05.783
It's an amazing thing to see.

01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:09.542
You're pretty wild.
You are quite a free spirit.

01:05:11.152 --> 01:05:12.203
Well, you know...

01:05:14.726 --> 01:05:16.704
You know, I was thinking
that maybe, if you'd like,

01:05:17.557 --> 01:05:18.690
after this is over,

01:05:19.464 --> 01:05:21.872
we could go kayaking together
on the Hudson sometime.

01:05:22.325 --> 01:05:24.895
I'd really like that.
That can be really great.

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:26.149
Sometime.

01:05:27.808 --> 01:05:28.233
Really?

01:05:28.917 --> 01:05:29.571
That's cool.

01:05:31.675 --> 01:05:34.885
Think about how they sounded when
they said his name, 'The Teacher'.

01:05:34.946 --> 01:05:36.154
Almost whispering.

01:05:36.548 --> 01:05:39.100
And that guy, DeCicco,
when he said 'The Teacher,'

01:05:39.414 --> 01:05:42.387
he was looking around that courtroom
and he was scared to death.

01:05:42.632 --> 01:05:44.841
-Bullshit.
-Hey, take it easy.

01:05:45.089 --> 01:05:46.993
Well, no, it's all right.
Go ahead, Barry. What?

01:05:47.097 --> 01:05:50.335
God damn it. Boffano is the boss!
They work for him!

01:05:50.395 --> 01:05:51.048
Thank you.

01:05:53.631 --> 01:05:54.310
I don't know.

01:05:56.863 --> 01:05:58.790
I think maybe Annie's got a point here.

01:06:02.073 --> 01:06:03.512
Okay. Wait, okay?

01:06:03.982 --> 01:06:05.768
They've got all of these deals.

01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:08.194
Cali, the Calabrians,

01:06:08.255 --> 01:06:09.184
the government of...

01:06:09.297 --> 01:06:11.339
What is that? The government of what?

01:06:11.649 --> 01:06:14.730
Curacao, okay, so they've got that,
they've got Jamaican runners.

01:06:15.153 --> 01:06:16.248
So there this...

01:06:16.613 --> 01:06:18.041
whole huge web

01:06:18.289 --> 01:06:20.198
with one spider
sitting in the middle of it,

01:06:20.258 --> 01:06:22.320
one guy scheming this whole thing.

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:24.344
And you think that's Louie Boffano?

01:06:24.529 --> 01:06:26.571
All right, so the Teacher
advises him. Big deal.

01:06:26.659 --> 01:06:29.203
The Teacher doesn't advise Boffano.
Uh-huh.

01:06:29.610 --> 01:06:31.922
He told him, 'I'm gonna dig
a tunnel to Riggio's house

01:06:31.983 --> 01:06:32.648
and I'm gonna kill him.'

01:06:32.709 --> 01:06:34.322
But Boffano gave his okay.

01:06:34.481 --> 01:06:35.767
He said, 'Kill that cocksucker.'

01:06:37.008 --> 01:06:39.730
Okay, so suppose I said,
'I'm gonna kill this guy right here.'

01:06:40.203 --> 01:06:43.574
And you said, 'You know what? Great.
Do that. Kill that cocksucker.'

01:06:44.048 --> 01:06:45.583
Now, does that make you a murderer?

01:06:46.448 --> 01:06:50.177
I don't believe this. You really want
us to let this grease ball go free?

01:06:51.238 --> 01:06:54.666
You know, I really don't care
for the term grease ball.

01:06:55.469 --> 01:06:58.892
All right, I'm sorry.
But, I mean, how much goddamn evidence

01:06:58.953 --> 01:07:01.860
-do you people want?
-Evidence, you know that's there...

01:07:06.238 --> 01:07:07.011
I don't get it.

01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:08.395
It isn't what we want.

01:07:08.456 --> 01:07:11.299
The evidence to get is
beyond a reasonable doubt...

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:12.768
'Reasonable.'
That's what I'm talking about.

01:07:12.855 --> 01:07:15.268
-Listen.
-What the hell is reasonable?

01:07:15.414 --> 01:07:16.755
Use common sense.

01:07:17.081 --> 01:07:19.774
Does that mean
every infinitesimal, little,

01:07:19.918 --> 01:07:22.661
teeny bit of goddamn anything
that's possible?

01:07:22.807 --> 01:07:25.201
-Can I finish, please?
-Why should we let you go on and on?

01:07:25.262 --> 01:07:26.921
You're not saying anything new.

01:07:27.714 --> 01:07:28.931
So what are you thinking?

01:07:32.445 --> 01:07:35.880
What I'm thinking is these
people are scum. And I...

01:07:41.139 --> 01:07:41.874
You know what?

01:07:44.342 --> 01:07:45.278
I don't care any more,

01:07:46.122 --> 01:07:47.203
one way or the other.

01:07:49.044 --> 01:07:49.958
I'm tired.

01:07:52.650 --> 01:07:55.148
-Reasonable doubt. You got it.
-Hold on a minute.

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:59.149
Maybe I don't understand the evidence.

01:07:59.891 --> 01:08:03.139
But I know a kid got killed. That's it.

01:08:03.495 --> 01:08:05.342
I mean, a little boy.

01:08:06.431 --> 01:08:09.138
And if we set this guy free,

01:08:09.668 --> 01:08:11.343
I know what he's going to do.

01:08:11.731 --> 01:08:14.564
He's going to go right
back to selling drugs,

01:08:15.173 --> 01:08:16.544
hurting more people.

01:08:18.899 --> 01:08:19.545
Annie,

01:08:20.395 --> 01:08:22.669
I don't need evidence for that.

01:08:22.916 --> 01:08:23.823
I know it.

01:08:26.017 --> 01:08:27.220
And, Laura,

01:08:28.033 --> 01:08:29.885
the evidence says...

01:08:30.627 --> 01:08:32.095
that the Teacher ordered the killing,

01:08:32.156 --> 01:08:34.357
not Boffano. The Teacher.

01:08:35.528 --> 01:08:37.091
Do you have a child?

01:08:38.095 --> 01:08:39.237
What does that have to do with it?

01:08:39.296 --> 01:08:40.533
It has everything to do with it.

01:08:42.555 --> 01:08:43.951
I have a boy, Laura.

01:08:45.603 --> 01:08:48.203
And I am terrified that something
could happen to him some day.

01:08:50.037 --> 01:08:51.158
And I know what you're thinking.

01:08:51.219 --> 01:08:53.493
You're thinking that we've
got to protect the children.

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:58.388
There's all of this chaos and it
just keeps getting worse and worse.

01:08:58.448 --> 01:09:00.679
And there's nowhere to
go to get away from it.

01:09:01.761 --> 01:09:02.818
But the law says

01:09:02.879 --> 01:09:05.238
that if they don't prove that
Boffano committed the crimes

01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:07.615
he's charged with,
prove beyond a reasonable doubt,

01:09:08.555 --> 01:09:10.162
then we have to set him free.

01:09:10.732 --> 01:09:12.850
We have to, even though we hate it.

01:09:14.108 --> 01:09:16.301
And you just pray that
you get him next time.

01:09:18.639 --> 01:09:21.894
But if you twist the law even just
a little for the best of reasons,

01:09:23.145 --> 01:09:25.609
then the law loses
whatever power it's got.

01:09:26.981 --> 01:09:29.759
And then my child is in even
more danger than before.

01:09:30.701 --> 01:09:31.961
And so are your grandchildren.

01:09:49.974 --> 01:09:51.482
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

01:09:51.769 --> 01:09:54.131
do you find the defendant
guilty or not guilty?

01:09:54.439 --> 01:09:57.195
On both counts,
we find the defendant not guilty.

01:10:01.004 --> 01:10:02.569
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

01:10:02.815 --> 01:10:05.587
Prisoner is released.
This court is adjourned.

01:10:35.379 --> 01:10:37.046
-Justice!
-Yeah!

01:10:39.717 --> 01:10:42.763
# You can't have none of him

01:10:43.526 --> 01:10:44.951
# He's our Louie

01:10:49.144 --> 01:10:54.138
# His heart, it beats too strong for you

01:10:54.421 --> 01:10:59.532
# Sorry, Miss DA But I think
he's just wrong for you #

01:10:59.896 --> 01:11:02.519
But he's so right for us, isn't he, folks?

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:04.235
Let's hear it for him!

01:11:04.350 --> 01:11:06.614
Welcome home, Louie!

01:11:13.197 --> 01:11:13.968
Hey!

01:11:14.692 --> 01:11:16.814
We tipped the scales on our side, eh?

01:11:18.007 --> 01:11:20.356
This is to the trial being over.

01:11:21.928 --> 01:11:23.510
And to a friend being home.

01:11:23.675 --> 01:11:24.977
Finally. Drink up.

01:11:28.733 --> 01:11:29.473
Mmm!

01:11:33.439 --> 01:11:34.743
I got a new boyfriend.

01:11:38.549 --> 01:11:40.919
Okay, I know what you're thinking,
but he's a very cool guy.

01:11:41.381 --> 01:11:43.401
Takes pictures, travels around the world.

01:11:45.116 --> 01:11:48.346
God, I'm having just so much fun
right now, I can't stand it.

01:11:48.776 --> 01:11:50.256
Are you guys fabulous?

01:11:50.317 --> 01:11:52.362
Your wonderful personalities
are coming right out...

01:11:52.423 --> 01:11:54.403
I don't feel like celebrating.
Can I be excused?

01:12:03.499 --> 01:12:04.635
Congratulations, Louie.

01:12:14.405 --> 01:12:16.091
I wasn't concerned, you know?

01:12:16.686 --> 01:12:18.185
Not for a minute!

01:12:20.918 --> 01:12:24.923
I swear, if I'm lying,
may God strike me dead on this spot.

01:12:27.391 --> 01:12:28.875
Come here, come here.

01:12:30.728 --> 01:12:32.318
-Congratulations, Louie.
-Wonderful.

01:12:34.432 --> 01:12:35.026
You know,

01:12:35.214 --> 01:12:37.176
that jury lady,

01:12:40.181 --> 01:12:42.076
I didn't like the way she looked at me.

01:12:43.670 --> 01:12:45.123
She made me a little uncomfortable.

01:12:47.678 --> 01:12:48.991
Well, she's afraid of you, Louie.

01:12:49.981 --> 01:12:52.050
But I wouldn't worry about it.
She's not gonna be a problem.

01:12:52.612 --> 01:12:53.822
No problem at all.

01:12:54.014 --> 01:12:54.858
'No problem?'

01:12:55.043 --> 01:12:57.077
What, is everything no problem to you?

01:12:57.827 --> 01:12:59.384
The last time I heard 'no problem'

01:12:59.445 --> 01:13:01.230
from you was with Sal fucking Riggio,

01:13:01.425 --> 01:13:02.734
and then there's some kid who was there

01:13:02.795 --> 01:13:04.429
that you should've known
about, but you didn't,

01:13:04.490 --> 01:13:07.368
and bada-bing my father's on
trial for his fucking life!

01:13:08.199 --> 01:13:10.326
Two made guys whack each other.
Who gives a fuck?

01:13:11.102 --> 01:13:12.144
But you killed a kid.

01:13:12.578 --> 01:13:14.554
Now the state's got a
hard on for my family

01:13:14.615 --> 01:13:15.985
ten fucking yards long

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:17.481
because you killed a kid!

01:13:17.541 --> 01:13:19.855
Oh, hey. Whoa, whoa.

01:13:21.997 --> 01:13:22.610
Hey.

01:13:23.826 --> 01:13:26.014
You're my son. My son.

01:13:29.783 --> 01:13:30.766
What are you gonna do?

01:13:31.435 --> 01:13:32.661
He worries about me.

01:13:35.292 --> 01:13:36.722
He thinks you're a psycho.

01:13:41.456 --> 01:13:43.621
Whatever he says,
he says out of love for his father, so...

01:13:46.321 --> 01:13:47.089
Go ahead.

01:13:48.242 --> 01:13:49.080
Give me the money.

01:14:01.976 --> 01:14:04.416
Are you sure we're not gonna have
any problem with this woman?

01:14:05.823 --> 01:14:07.633
Don't worry about it, Louie. No problem.

01:14:08.263 --> 01:14:09.450
I got my eye on her.

01:14:49.570 --> 01:14:50.529
Miss Laird,

01:14:51.041 --> 01:14:53.670
get up quietly, speak to no one.
Come with me.

01:14:58.872 --> 01:15:01.451
Your bank account shot up
to $12,000 last month.

01:15:02.392 --> 01:15:04.328
-I sold some art work.
-Good for you.

01:15:05.282 --> 01:15:06.220
But you know what?

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:09.402
We don't really care how you got it.

01:15:10.596 --> 01:15:12.418
'Cause we don't think
you did this for the money.

01:15:14.085 --> 01:15:15.733
We think these guys scared you.

01:15:16.781 --> 01:15:17.948
They're still scaring you.

01:15:18.863 --> 01:15:20.777
Now it's time to stop being scared.

01:15:22.848 --> 01:15:24.381
Let us get you out of this mess.

01:15:25.269 --> 01:15:26.438
How would you do that?

01:15:26.971 --> 01:15:27.901
You help us,

01:15:28.643 --> 01:15:31.171
you testify for us, we're
gonna put you somewhere safe.

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:33.135
You and your boy.

01:15:34.397 --> 01:15:35.299
And then what?

01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:37.418
Whatever you want.

01:15:37.921 --> 01:15:39.963
The mob aren't what they used to be,
Ms. Laird.

01:15:40.319 --> 01:15:42.081
They don't often kill civilians.

01:15:44.276 --> 01:15:45.751
-Now can I go?
-Not yet.

01:15:46.023 --> 01:15:46.789
Yeah, hold it.

01:15:47.506 --> 01:15:49.611
Well, then I'd like to make this
quick, 'cause I wanna to get home

01:15:49.862 --> 01:15:50.911
before my kid gets out of school.

01:15:51.061 --> 01:15:52.703
Send a car over
and have the kid picked up.

01:15:52.763 --> 01:15:54.313
No! You just stay away from my house!

01:15:54.548 --> 01:15:56.448
You put me in danger when
you come around my house,

01:15:56.509 --> 01:15:57.800
don't you bastards understand that?

01:15:57.861 --> 01:15:58.896
In danger, Ms. Laird?

01:15:59.269 --> 01:15:59.902
From what?

01:16:01.076 --> 01:16:02.193
From the man in the moon.

01:16:03.236 --> 01:16:04.894
Suppose there were an
unfortunate leak to the press

01:16:04.955 --> 01:16:06.765
to the effect that you were cooperating?

01:16:06.903 --> 01:16:09.512
'Juror brings tampering
charges against Boffano.'

01:16:09.713 --> 01:16:11.317
That'd make a great story, wouldn't it?

01:16:14.311 --> 01:16:15.487
You know, you do this,

01:16:16.065 --> 01:16:17.161
and they'll kill my child.

01:16:17.221 --> 01:16:18.160
No, they won't.

01:16:18.448 --> 01:16:19.913
You help us, they won't.

01:16:20.111 --> 01:16:22.055
They always threaten. Always.

01:16:22.384 --> 01:16:23.884
But they don't do squat.

01:16:25.478 --> 01:16:26.744
Who else is gonna protect you?

01:16:34.374 --> 01:16:35.546
Look, I'm not saying no.

01:16:35.668 --> 01:16:37.309
But I'm gonna need some
time to think about this.

01:16:37.541 --> 01:16:38.420
How much time?

01:16:39.381 --> 01:16:41.004
Oh, just a day or two.

01:16:41.269 --> 01:16:42.867
But you keep your people away from us.

01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:44.291
You wanna watch me, okay.

01:16:44.352 --> 01:16:46.453
But don't you let anybody know
you're watching. Do you hear me?

01:16:46.884 --> 01:16:48.200
I'll give you 48 hours.

01:16:48.302 --> 01:16:49.376
When you're ready to talk,

01:16:49.774 --> 01:16:51.563
find a secure line. Dial this number.

01:16:51.789 --> 01:16:53.424
You can trust anybody in this room.

01:17:18.883 --> 01:17:19.696
Paul!

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:24.140
I had a shitty day.

01:17:30.824 --> 01:17:32.797
-Let's see what we can do about that.
-Oh, good.

01:17:39.637 --> 01:17:40.570
Shake it!

01:18:01.804 --> 01:18:02.829
Give me another one.

01:18:03.471 --> 01:18:04.828
That's a bad idea.

01:18:06.453 --> 01:18:07.893
I'm a doctor. I know what I'm doing.

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:09.860
I want you to do something for me.

01:19:11.512 --> 01:19:14.179
What else?
What else could I possibly do for you?

01:19:25.943 --> 01:19:27.451
I want you to take these.

01:19:30.547 --> 01:19:31.547
What are they?

01:19:33.117 --> 01:19:34.918
Secobarbital and

01:19:35.667 --> 01:19:36.761
Amobarbital.

01:19:39.957 --> 01:19:41.168
Stuff like that.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.718
No, I don't want you to take them for me.

01:19:45.996 --> 01:19:47.896
I want you to do it for Oliver.

01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:02.231
Who are you?

01:20:03.532 --> 01:20:05.132
Well, haven't you figured that out yet?

01:20:06.062 --> 01:20:07.117
I'm Annie's friend.

01:20:13.489 --> 01:20:14.792
You had all the answers

01:20:14.853 --> 01:20:17.012
when you told Annie to go
see that judge, didn't you?

01:20:17.738 --> 01:20:19.399
When you put Oliver at risk.

01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:21.637
This boy that you care so much about.

01:20:21.698 --> 01:20:23.639
Then you had ice in your veins.

01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:26.070
Then you wanted to be the big heroine.

01:20:27.738 --> 01:20:31.172
Now I'm gonna give you a
chance to be a real heroine.

01:20:32.255 --> 01:20:34.989
Because after what you've done,
this is Oliver's only chance.

01:20:37.347 --> 01:20:39.677
I care about him just
as much as you do but...

01:20:41.613 --> 01:20:42.606
I will kill him.

01:20:44.455 --> 01:20:46.920
I told Annie what would
happen if she betrayed us.

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:52.182
And I am a man of my word.

01:20:52.984 --> 01:20:56.619
The way of power is the unvarying way.

01:21:00.003 --> 01:21:01.570
Now the police are with Annie

01:21:03.068 --> 01:21:06.590
and we have to give her a little
taste of grief to save Oliver.

01:21:07.344 --> 01:21:09.273
Just a little inoculation

01:21:10.718 --> 01:21:12.631
to make sure she stays afraid.

01:21:12.749 --> 01:21:14.487
-No! No!
-Take it.

01:21:14.952 --> 01:21:17.009
-No!
-Take it. Take it.

01:21:17.967 --> 01:21:19.934
Fuck. Help!

01:21:23.223 --> 01:21:23.986
Take it.

01:21:31.923 --> 01:21:32.371
There.

01:21:33.815 --> 01:21:35.139
Drink it. Drink.

01:21:37.472 --> 01:21:39.254
It's all right. Digest.

01:21:39.410 --> 01:21:41.284
No one at the hospital would believe it.

01:21:41.654 --> 01:21:43.249
Why would she kill herself...

01:22:46.877 --> 01:22:47.656
She's gone.

01:22:48.745 --> 01:22:51.505
I don't know if the Feds got her
in a safe house or something.

01:22:51.801 --> 01:22:53.088
But she cleared out all her bank accounts.

01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:55.562
She took that money you gave her.
And she's gone.

01:22:56.469 --> 01:22:57.445
Oh, hey, it's all right.

01:22:58.589 --> 01:23:00.893
I mean, she's never gonna betray us.

01:23:01.115 --> 01:23:02.139
What are you kidding me?

01:23:02.941 --> 01:23:04.582
She hates our fucking guts.

01:23:06.163 --> 01:23:08.600
All she needs is some time to be alone.

01:23:09.199 --> 01:23:11.408
I'm so sick of that bullshit with you.

01:23:11.468 --> 01:23:12.762
How the fuck do you know that?

01:23:12.971 --> 01:23:15.548
Because a friend of hers died last night.

01:23:21.176 --> 01:23:21.910
Who died?

01:23:22.943 --> 01:23:23.782
The doctor.

01:23:31.236 --> 01:23:32.757
Annie is in great danger

01:23:33.439 --> 01:23:34.973
and her child is in great danger

01:23:35.034 --> 01:23:37.195
and I will do everything that I can...

01:23:37.576 --> 01:23:38.671
to protect them.

01:23:38.953 --> 01:23:40.895
Now what part of that
don't you understand?

01:23:41.198 --> 01:23:41.990
I mean,

01:23:42.799 --> 01:23:44.252
I could explain it to you.

01:23:45.936 --> 01:23:46.949
That's all right.

01:23:48.438 --> 01:23:49.741
I don't need your explanations.

01:23:56.713 --> 01:23:57.479
Hello?

01:23:57.621 --> 01:23:59.933
Um, Miss Emma Faldo?

01:24:00.183 --> 01:24:01.157
Yes, speaking.

01:24:01.485 --> 01:24:04.021
Yes. This is John Slivey in New York.

01:24:04.551 --> 01:24:05.911
Your cousin, Annie Laird,

01:24:05.972 --> 01:24:07.930
was working for me up
until about a week ago

01:24:07.991 --> 01:24:11.401
and she listed you as an emergency contact

01:24:11.503 --> 01:24:14.838
and I have a pay check for her
and no way to reach her.

01:24:14.898 --> 01:24:16.099
Do you happen to know where I can...

01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:17.594
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

01:24:18.135 --> 01:24:19.731
-No?
-No, I'm sorry.

01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:21.843
I see.

01:24:22.914 --> 01:24:26.215
-Well, that's too bad.
-I wish I could be of more help.

01:24:26.276 --> 01:24:28.418
Anybody else in the family
might know how to...

01:24:28.478 --> 01:24:30.060
-No, I don't think so.
-...reach her?

01:24:30.213 --> 01:24:31.780
-Not since...
-Really?

01:24:33.502 --> 01:24:34.769
It is easy to lose touch.

01:24:52.069 --> 01:24:53.012
Gracias.

01:24:56.634 --> 01:24:57.546
Gracias.

01:26:29.620 --> 01:26:31.773
Talk about a surprise! God!

01:26:32.998 --> 01:26:35.865
-Uncle Boone.
-Oliver! Look at you! Hey!

01:27:16.346 --> 01:27:17.446
Here. Over here.

01:27:23.741 --> 01:27:25.191
You guys are gonna love it here.

01:27:25.922 --> 01:27:27.737
You know, tomorrow I'm gonna take you

01:27:28.061 --> 01:27:30.511
to this beautiful Mayan altar.

01:27:31.559 --> 01:27:32.601
Wish I had more time!

01:27:35.332 --> 01:27:39.501
More time? Annie, when you live here,
it's all you have, is time.

01:27:41.683 --> 01:27:44.192
I have to go back.
And I need you to take care of Oliver.

01:27:44.808 --> 01:27:46.181
What? Wait a minute.

01:27:46.643 --> 01:27:48.403
Look, you have to do it.
There's no one else.

01:27:50.237 --> 01:27:52.087
There's no way you're going back.
You're not leaving.

01:27:52.148 --> 01:27:53.658
-I'm not letting you go back.
-It's not your choice.

01:27:55.285 --> 01:27:56.760
Your choice is you can
take care of Oliver,

01:27:56.820 --> 01:27:58.597
or you can send him home
with me to be killed.

01:27:59.322 --> 01:28:01.002
And I'm asking you to take care of Oliver.

01:28:11.935 --> 01:28:13.330
I know what I'm asking.

01:28:14.619 --> 01:28:15.930
I know it's too much.

01:28:19.509 --> 01:28:20.469
But there's no one.

01:28:22.245 --> 01:28:23.795
There's nobody else I've got to go to.

01:28:24.714 --> 01:28:26.447
Please. You're my oldest friend.

01:28:27.684 --> 01:28:28.910
Why do you want to go back?

01:28:32.055 --> 01:28:32.963
I have to.

01:28:40.110 --> 01:28:41.677
-Hello?
-Yeah, she came back.

01:28:44.623 --> 01:28:45.350
She what?

01:28:45.802 --> 01:28:47.557
She came back.
Just like you said she would.

01:28:48.638 --> 01:28:50.605
Yeah, she wants to meet
you tomorrow. 1:00.

01:28:54.444 --> 01:28:55.685
-Hey.
-Yeah, I'm here.

01:28:55.745 --> 01:28:57.579
Why the fuck would she come back?

01:28:59.249 --> 01:28:59.796
Huh?

01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:03.363
Well, she had to come back.

01:29:07.554 --> 01:29:09.935
She got her child to safety.
She took him...

01:29:11.269 --> 01:29:12.957
to this little village in Guatemala.

01:29:13.018 --> 01:29:15.221
Some place that I could never find them.

01:29:17.643 --> 01:29:18.903
And she had to come back.

01:29:21.665 --> 01:29:22.260
I mean,

01:29:23.346 --> 01:29:26.078
everything that we've been
through is like a marriage,

01:29:27.105 --> 01:29:27.993
Annie and I.

01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:32.273
She couldn't let it go.

01:29:34.074 --> 01:29:34.838
She couldn't.

01:29:36.221 --> 01:29:36.785
Yeah.

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:44.911
-No, it's too dangerous.
-But it's the only way.

01:29:44.972 --> 01:29:46.946
-If he finds out you're wired, you're dead.
-He won't.

01:29:47.007 --> 01:29:48.474
-What if he pats you down?
-He won't.

01:29:49.032 --> 01:29:50.119
He thinks that I'm timid.

01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:52.391
He would never touch me
unless I wanted him to.

01:29:52.524 --> 01:29:54.009
He likes to be thought of as a gentleman.

01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:56.345
Ms. Laird,
I don't wanna lose control here.

01:29:56.673 --> 01:29:58.862
I don't wanna put you
in an unsafe situation.

01:29:58.923 --> 01:30:00.723
Oh,
and you think that I'm safe here with you?

01:30:03.016 --> 01:30:03.618
Listen.

01:30:04.951 --> 01:30:07.527
Please, just give me the wire. Please.

01:30:09.601 --> 01:30:12.056
I will get you such juicy stuff on Boffano

01:30:12.117 --> 01:30:14.724
that you could lock him up for
the rest of his fucking life.

01:30:15.284 --> 01:30:16.650
You could put them all away.

01:31:16.786 --> 01:31:17.989
What do you think of them?

01:31:19.055 --> 01:31:19.949
My guardians.

01:31:21.067 --> 01:31:23.223
They're clueless. Incompetent.

01:31:24.327 --> 01:31:25.419
They irritate me.

01:31:26.352 --> 01:31:28.862
You know what irritates me
most is their weakness.

01:31:30.834 --> 01:31:32.278
Well, I think that
you should forgive them.

01:31:32.339 --> 01:31:34.901
Their hearts are fine
and they do love you, Annie.

01:31:38.055 --> 01:31:39.087
Don't tell me that.

01:31:40.810 --> 01:31:43.711
Don't you talk to me
about love and forgiveness.

01:31:45.171 --> 01:31:46.434
Oh, you bastard!

01:31:47.950 --> 01:31:50.943
I hate you, you know that
I would kill you if I could.

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:56.450
Or is this the lesson for today, Teacher?

01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:59.569
Or is it how terror
is doing me so much good?

01:31:59.629 --> 01:32:01.458
How strong it's gonna make me?

01:32:01.898 --> 01:32:04.266
Or is it how your love
is gonna save my child?

01:32:04.381 --> 01:32:05.580
-Annie...
-You shut up!

01:32:07.278 --> 01:32:08.114
Don't you smile at me.

01:32:09.105 --> 01:32:11.595
Don't you ever fucking think
you can smile at me.

01:32:11.775 --> 01:32:13.074
Don't you even look at me.

01:32:14.464 --> 01:32:15.761
You wanna know what I hate most?

01:32:19.972 --> 01:32:21.372
I hate that you were right.

01:32:23.586 --> 01:32:24.819
I am stronger.

01:32:27.103 --> 01:32:28.044
Annie...

01:32:30.979 --> 01:32:32.483
Is that all that you feel?

01:32:35.312 --> 01:32:35.954
Stop.

01:32:37.039 --> 01:32:37.842
Just stop.

01:32:53.985 --> 01:32:54.899
Do you hear that?

01:32:57.269 --> 01:32:58.863
I went back to my studio again.

01:32:59.155 --> 01:33:00.363
Looked at all my old work.

01:33:02.192 --> 01:33:05.430
And it all seemed just so restrained.
Smothered.

01:33:07.192 --> 01:33:09.406
No fire. No guts.

01:33:10.234 --> 01:33:12.190
Just the way my life has always been.

01:33:13.469 --> 01:33:15.025
Smother the passion.

01:33:15.891 --> 01:33:17.965
Anything that you're frightened of,

01:33:20.009 --> 01:33:20.861
lock it out.

01:33:24.581 --> 01:33:26.180
I don't wanna live like that any more.

01:33:28.938 --> 01:33:30.465
I don't want any more weakness.

01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:38.732
And this is what I don't understand.

01:33:39.964 --> 01:33:41.826
You have all of this strength,

01:33:41.887 --> 01:33:45.039
and you work for Louie Boffano, that...

01:33:46.666 --> 01:33:47.461
Goon.

01:33:49.151 --> 01:33:49.940
Well, he's...

01:33:50.783 --> 01:33:51.978
he's your friend.

01:33:53.588 --> 01:33:55.483
Louie Boffano doesn't have any friends.

01:33:56.916 --> 01:33:57.693
He's a monster.

01:33:57.754 --> 01:34:00.362
And like most monsters, he
commands some respect. But...

01:34:01.392 --> 01:34:02.412
not for long.

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:05.587
My colleagues from Cali
are growing very tired of him.

01:34:07.804 --> 01:34:08.975
Are you gonna get rid of him?

01:34:09.325 --> 01:34:12.208
Well, eventually we'll discard Old
Louie, but for the time being,

01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:14.442
we might keep him as a figure head.

01:34:15.465 --> 01:34:17.580
Take the heat off of me.
Let him be a mountain.

01:34:18.037 --> 01:34:19.300
I'll be a ravine.

01:34:20.571 --> 01:34:22.671
God, I'd like to have
a place like this someday.

01:34:24.274 --> 01:34:25.507
With a farmhouse,

01:34:25.989 --> 01:34:27.218
wood floors,

01:34:28.375 --> 01:34:29.887
a child playing in the yard.

01:34:32.231 --> 01:34:33.764
A child like Oliver.

01:34:38.772 --> 01:34:40.847
And after that, I want nothing

01:34:42.592 --> 01:34:43.465
but love.

01:34:44.888 --> 01:34:48.087
Do you think I can turn myself
into sheer love, Annie?

01:34:48.605 --> 01:34:50.071
Do you think I have that power?

01:34:57.735 --> 01:34:59.333
I'm sorry that you hate me.

01:35:04.814 --> 01:35:06.447
Because I do love you.

01:35:23.299 --> 01:35:24.874
What the hell were you doing?

01:35:25.416 --> 01:35:27.725
The door opens, the door shuts.
Then nothing.

01:35:28.071 --> 01:35:29.533
Look, Eddie was driving around.

01:35:29.594 --> 01:35:31.111
The Teacher just never showed up.

01:35:31.420 --> 01:35:32.756
Look, maybe he guessed
something was going on.

01:35:32.976 --> 01:35:34.225
How would he guess that?

01:35:34.944 --> 01:35:35.536
I don't know.

01:35:35.725 --> 01:35:36.618
You figure it out.

01:35:36.698 --> 01:35:37.833
Me, I'm going home.

01:35:38.485 --> 01:35:39.975
We're not done yet, Ms. Laird.

01:35:40.883 --> 01:35:41.940
Oh, yes, we are.

01:35:42.029 --> 01:35:43.337
If you want anything else
out of me tonight,

01:35:43.398 --> 01:35:44.484
you're gonna have to arrest me.

01:35:45.252 --> 01:35:45.952
Annie?

01:35:50.026 --> 01:35:51.225
Don't call me Annie.

01:35:52.096 --> 01:35:53.196
Ms. Laird?

01:36:09.152 --> 01:36:10.135
Who the hell is this?

01:36:11.481 --> 01:36:12.058
Stop.

01:36:12.184 --> 01:36:13.790
It's okay. It's okay. I know her.

01:36:13.850 --> 01:36:15.792
Hey, what are you, deaf?
I said stop.

01:36:15.852 --> 01:36:17.804
-I said stop.
-It's okay. I know her.

01:36:18.109 --> 01:36:19.315
-You know her?
-Yes.

01:36:19.722 --> 01:36:21.730
Mr. Boffano, I need to talk to you.

01:36:24.861 --> 01:36:25.994
What can I do for you?

01:36:28.026 --> 01:36:29.073
Do you recognize me?

01:36:29.732 --> 01:36:30.582
Yeah, sure.

01:36:31.042 --> 01:36:32.095
You're the juror lady.

01:36:33.836 --> 01:36:34.615
What do you want?

01:36:35.511 --> 01:36:36.811
I have something to show you.

01:36:38.875 --> 01:36:40.058
You got something for me?

01:36:41.344 --> 01:36:41.986
What?

01:36:42.591 --> 01:36:43.193
A gift.

01:36:44.351 --> 01:36:46.151
I give you a gift and you leave me,

01:36:46.212 --> 01:36:48.347
my friends and my family alone.

01:36:49.354 --> 01:36:50.434
Of course.

01:36:51.043 --> 01:36:52.418
I would never hurt your family,

01:36:52.729 --> 01:36:54.277
nor you, nor nobody.

01:36:54.591 --> 01:36:55.494
Lady, I don't even know you...

01:36:55.555 --> 01:36:56.743
Swear it, Louie,
and I'll give you your gift.

01:36:58.327 --> 01:36:58.984
Hey,

01:37:00.468 --> 01:37:02.171
I'm not interested in your fucking gift.

01:37:02.231 --> 01:37:03.490
-Oh, yes, you are.
-Lady.

01:37:03.551 --> 01:37:05.226
-Hey, hey.
-Easy, easy, easy.

01:37:05.678 --> 01:37:07.038
She's got something you gotta hear.

01:37:11.858 --> 01:37:12.563
Come here.

01:37:13.237 --> 01:37:13.867
Go ahead.

01:37:21.206 --> 01:37:23.003
Louie Boffano doesn't have any friends.

01:37:24.287 --> 01:37:27.330
He's a monster. And like most monsters,
he commands some respect.

01:37:27.390 --> 01:37:29.465
But not for long.

01:37:30.661 --> 01:37:33.628
My colleagues from Cali
are growing very tired of him.

01:37:35.693 --> 01:37:36.973
Did you enjoy that, Mr. Boffano?

01:37:39.035 --> 01:37:39.960
Would you like to hear more?

01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:41.934
When did you tape this?

01:37:42.942 --> 01:37:43.842
Yesterday.

01:37:44.982 --> 01:37:47.200
-And who wired you?
-I wired myself.

01:37:47.261 --> 01:37:48.178
Let me have it.

01:37:48.529 --> 01:37:50.520
-Not until you swear.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, I swear.

01:37:50.581 --> 01:37:52.681
I'm out of your life forever.
Let me have it.

01:37:53.816 --> 01:37:55.082
I wouldn't waste any time.

01:38:05.967 --> 01:38:06.675
Vince.

01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:08.965
Hey, Ed. What are you doing here?

01:38:11.209 --> 01:38:12.225
Louie wants to meet.

01:38:13.793 --> 01:38:14.411
When?

01:38:14.779 --> 01:38:17.121
Today. 6:00. Palisades.

01:38:19.475 --> 01:38:22.042
I don't know. The meetings
are so risky, you know.

01:38:23.913 --> 01:38:25.988
I mean, can't you just tell him to relax?

01:38:26.715 --> 01:38:28.200
Yeah, yeah. Sure, I'll tell him.

01:38:28.676 --> 01:38:30.144
No, he says it's important.

01:38:32.455 --> 01:38:34.999
Why all this urgency?

01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:38.452
It's about Annie.

01:38:38.877 --> 01:38:41.377
He says he can't trust her.

01:38:42.632 --> 01:38:43.632
Wants her taken out.

01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:49.366
What do you think, Ed?
You think she needs to be taken out?

01:38:51.037 --> 01:38:53.776
Since when does anybody give
a shit what I think? Right?

01:38:55.491 --> 01:38:57.133
Well, I mean, you just
seemed to have developed

01:38:57.194 --> 01:39:00.180
a certain amount of fondness
for her lately, you know.

01:39:00.650 --> 01:39:01.543
Yeah, well,

01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:03.633
that's history.

01:39:04.487 --> 01:39:06.888
It's just business, right?

01:39:09.992 --> 01:39:11.358
-Yeah.
-Well...

01:39:13.095 --> 01:39:13.961
Do what you gotta do.

01:39:14.415 --> 01:39:15.388
6:00, right?

01:39:16.105 --> 01:39:16.708
Yeah.

01:39:22.406 --> 01:39:25.202
So every other day of the year,
they call him San Simon,

01:39:25.541 --> 01:39:26.927
and they treat him with great respect.

01:39:27.852 --> 01:39:30.153
But tomorrow,
they'll call him by his real name.

01:39:31.011 --> 01:39:31.941
Judas.

01:39:32.761 --> 01:39:35.314
They take him to that tree
over there and they hang him.

01:39:36.156 --> 01:39:37.222
Oliver?

01:39:38.443 --> 01:39:39.102
What's wrong?

01:39:40.770 --> 01:39:42.901
-When's she coming back?
-Dr. Boone!

01:39:43.138 --> 01:39:45.150
-Doctor!
-Hey, just one second.

01:39:47.363 --> 01:39:48.178
Oliver,

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.586
she left you here because she loves you,

01:39:51.869 --> 01:39:52.468
okay?

01:39:52.686 --> 01:39:53.269
Yeah.

01:39:57.413 --> 01:39:58.852
Here. Go have some fun, all right.

01:39:58.913 --> 01:40:00.991
I gotta go deal with this. I'll
catch up with you, all right.

01:40:22.688 --> 01:40:24.368
I don't think we have to worry about that.

01:40:26.369 --> 01:40:28.168
-Yeah.
-What's in the case?

01:40:29.205 --> 01:40:30.104
Open it up.

01:40:32.642 --> 01:40:34.002
I'll just have to get back to you.

01:40:37.013 --> 01:40:37.734
Vincent.

01:40:38.331 --> 01:40:39.506
I'm glad you came.

01:40:42.702 --> 01:40:43.462
What's this?

01:40:45.872 --> 01:40:47.272
I want you to take your money back.

01:40:49.692 --> 01:40:52.245
Things got a little more
complicated than we hoped, so...

01:40:53.723 --> 01:40:54.708
the money's yours.

01:40:57.932 --> 01:40:59.392
Let's walk. We need to talk. Mmm?

01:41:03.588 --> 01:41:06.636
It's more than 10 years, we've been
working together. Isn't that right?

01:41:07.209 --> 01:41:07.637
Yeah.

01:41:08.054 --> 01:41:08.981
You know what...

01:41:09.679 --> 01:41:12.146
I don't know the first thing
about what makes you tick.

01:41:13.344 --> 01:41:14.313
Isn't that funny?

01:41:14.668 --> 01:41:16.429
I mean, in all those 10 years,

01:41:16.703 --> 01:41:18.566
I don't know nothing about you.

01:41:18.902 --> 01:41:19.673
Until...

01:41:20.399 --> 01:41:22.925
this woman, I mean, this juror woman,

01:41:24.527 --> 01:41:27.712
this morning,
to my mother's grave she comes.

01:41:27.773 --> 01:41:28.927
-And she says to me...
-What?

01:41:30.578 --> 01:41:31.976
Annie came to see you.

01:41:33.573 --> 01:41:36.587
She said you've been saying
ugly things about me.

01:41:37.473 --> 01:41:40.202
Said you called me
a mother fucking monster.

01:41:40.468 --> 01:41:43.269
Oh, please. Don't even try to deny it.

01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:45.853
It's on tape.

01:41:47.249 --> 01:41:48.018
That woman,

01:41:48.805 --> 01:41:50.326
you know the one you've gone soft over,

01:41:50.386 --> 01:41:52.216
you think is the love of your life,

01:41:53.808 --> 01:41:55.374
she wants you dead.

01:41:57.800 --> 01:41:59.689
You said you were gonna discard me.

01:42:00.708 --> 01:42:02.505
Now look who gets discarded.

01:42:05.516 --> 01:42:06.294
Get it done.

01:42:27.690 --> 01:42:29.735
And everybody thought you were a genius.

01:42:30.393 --> 01:42:32.270
Hey, Joseph. Take a look at your father.

01:43:12.468 --> 01:43:13.700
You're fucking crazy.

01:43:15.971 --> 01:43:16.971
Bada-bing!

01:43:40.370 --> 01:43:41.070
Hello?

01:43:43.222 --> 01:43:45.321
-Eddie?
-No, it is not Eddie.

01:43:46.268 --> 01:43:47.951
He's right here.
Would you like to speak with him?

01:43:52.408 --> 01:43:55.535
Annie, I suppose I should be angry with
you for betraying me, but I'm not.

01:43:56.464 --> 01:43:58.031
I know that this has been hard for you.

01:43:59.548 --> 01:44:00.264
I did things

01:44:01.429 --> 01:44:03.488
to protect you and Oliver.

01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:06.392
It must have been difficult
for you to grasp.

01:44:07.590 --> 01:44:11.600
What you would say, what you
would do to protect your child.

01:44:11.660 --> 01:44:13.665
I mean, you bring Oliver down
to Guatemala and then what?

01:44:14.129 --> 01:44:16.243
You're gonna come back here
and you're gonna destroy me?

01:44:17.003 --> 01:44:18.330
Well, that is not going to happen.

01:44:20.135 --> 01:44:22.044
Do you remember what I told
you at the studio that night?

01:44:22.104 --> 01:44:24.180
I told you if you would trust me,
then Oliver would be safe.

01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:26.449
But if you betrayed me, then no
matter what the personal cost to me,

01:44:26.509 --> 01:44:28.067
Oliver would suffer. Do you remember that?

01:44:28.777 --> 01:44:30.318
And I begged you to believe me.

01:44:30.513 --> 01:44:31.921
But how can I ask you to trust me

01:44:31.981 --> 01:44:35.858
when mistrust and betrayal
are rooted in your character.

01:44:35.918 --> 01:44:39.419
I can just as easily ask you to
change the pattern of the stars.

01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:43.911
But now Oliver is going to die in
the morning. We both know that.

01:44:46.662 --> 01:44:48.629
And there's nothing
we can do to stop that.

01:44:51.559 --> 01:44:52.669
We can only witness.

01:45:06.348 --> 01:45:07.706
Enjoy your flight, Mr. Wordham.

01:45:08.091 --> 01:45:09.140
You can board now.

01:45:20.243 --> 01:45:22.904
-Here's my ticket.
-I'm sorry, you've just missed this flight.

01:45:24.314 --> 01:45:24.934
Ma'am?

01:45:25.285 --> 01:45:26.128
Look, I have to...

01:45:26.207 --> 01:45:28.516
My son is dying, okay.
I got to get to the gate.

01:45:28.841 --> 01:45:30.177
No, ma'am. I'm sorry.

01:45:31.144 --> 01:45:32.710
Well, we can put you on another flight.

01:45:32.771 --> 01:45:35.280
If you hurry, there's another
flight to Guatemala via Houston.

01:45:35.341 --> 01:45:36.874
-Where? What gate?
-126.

01:46:02.971 --> 01:46:04.437
-Habla ingles?
-Yes, I do.

01:46:05.674 --> 01:46:07.115
-What's your name, man?
-Danielle.

01:46:07.676 --> 01:46:09.385
You think I could hire you
to give me a ride somewhere?

01:46:09.445 --> 01:46:11.712
No, I'll give you a ride.
You don't have to pay.

01:46:13.415 --> 01:46:14.668
It will be a long journey.

01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:43.500
I got to have a car. I have a lot of money.
I just need one car.

01:46:57.393 --> 01:47:00.211
Look, I don't care. Here's everything
I've got, okay. Just get me there.

01:50:28.170 --> 01:50:28.787
Oliver?

01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:32.045
Oliver?

01:50:43.656 --> 01:50:45.191
What is this? A fucking zoo?

01:51:19.321 --> 01:51:21.597
-Annie!
-Get back, Boone. Right now.

01:51:21.658 --> 01:51:22.821
-Mom!
-Oliver, get out of here.

01:51:22.912 --> 01:51:25.121
Get him out of here! Get him out of here!

01:51:25.205 --> 01:51:26.555
-Let go! Mom!
-Annie!

01:51:26.616 --> 01:51:27.564
Get off!

01:51:36.705 --> 01:51:37.402
Oh!

01:51:47.717 --> 01:51:49.573
Annie, you really are astonishing.

01:51:51.091 --> 01:51:51.867
I mean,

01:51:52.681 --> 01:51:53.860
you won over the jury,

01:51:56.392 --> 01:51:58.178
and then you set me up with Boffano.

01:52:01.137 --> 01:52:03.396
And now you've chartered a plane.

01:52:04.108 --> 01:52:05.608
Yep. With your money.

01:52:13.513 --> 01:52:15.114
But you're right, Annie.

01:52:15.241 --> 01:52:16.477
You have to kill me.

01:52:18.651 --> 01:52:20.795
I see that now. It has to be that way.

01:52:22.517 --> 01:52:23.946
Because if you shoot me,

01:52:27.289 --> 01:52:29.764
then you and I will be bonded forever.

01:52:34.094 --> 01:52:36.193
No, we won't!

01:53:07.662 --> 01:53:10.463
-Oliver? Oliver?
-Mom?

01:53:17.372 --> 01:53:18.250
I love you.
