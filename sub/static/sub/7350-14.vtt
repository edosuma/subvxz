WEBVTT

00:07.641 --> 00:10.111
MAN: We've got a few hundred
protesters at the front

00:10.144 --> 00:11.712
of the building.
Suggest secondary entry.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.547
MAN 2:
Roger that.

00:13.581 --> 00:16.084
ETA for Admiral Pack--
under two minutes

00:16.117 --> 00:17.618
to the courthouse.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.553
We'll take a look
at the crowd,

00:19.587 --> 00:21.655
make the call whether or not
to divert to the garage.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.357
MAN 1:
Copy that.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.693
First NCIS
security detail?

00:25.726 --> 00:27.628
No, but it's, uh,
it's been a while.

00:27.661 --> 00:29.263
Used to do these
all the time

00:29.297 --> 00:31.099
when I was stationed
in the Midwest.

00:31.132 --> 00:32.700
It's like riding
a bike...

00:32.733 --> 00:35.103
with lots of people
screaming profanities.

00:35.136 --> 00:37.271
When did they renovate

00:37.305 --> 00:38.539
the Royal House?

00:38.572 --> 00:39.640
You from the area?

00:39.673 --> 00:41.542
Born and bred.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.277
I requested this detail.

00:43.311 --> 00:46.247
Been away from
home too long.

00:47.815 --> 00:49.650
It looks like
they have rolled out

00:49.683 --> 00:51.819
the red carpet for you,
Agent Hackett.

00:51.852 --> 00:53.387
Why are we stopping?

00:53.421 --> 00:55.156
MAN 1: The admiral
nixed secondary entry.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.258
He insists we go
through the front.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.393
Of course he did.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.101
Admiral Pack,

01:07.135 --> 01:08.736
you sure this
is such a good idea?

01:08.769 --> 01:10.671
Damn straight.
Came here

01:10.704 --> 01:11.872
to show that we
empathize with their

01:11.905 --> 01:13.307
disappointment on having
the contract

01:13.341 --> 01:14.675
go elsewhere. We go

01:14.708 --> 01:16.510
through the front door.
Admiral...

01:16.544 --> 01:19.113
Stared down the enemy
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

01:19.147 --> 01:20.848
Hell if I'm gonna run from this.

01:27.455 --> 01:29.857
Possible hostile
at three o'clock,

01:29.890 --> 01:31.625
in the blue jacket.

01:31.659 --> 01:32.860
Admiral, we got to get you

01:32.893 --> 01:34.195
inside right now.
A few more minutes.

01:43.571 --> 01:44.805
Negative on the hosti...

01:48.509 --> 01:50.578
Come on, shots fired,
admiral moving

01:50.611 --> 01:51.645
back to the car.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.547
Agent down.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.188
Get across, move it!

02:05.459 --> 02:07.861
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:07.895 --> 02:10.598
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

02:10.631 --> 02:13.201
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:13.234 --> 02:14.435
* How, how, how, how

02:14.468 --> 02:16.737
* Hey, hey

02:22.610 --> 02:23.911
* You gotta come on.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.782
BRODY: Admiral made the call
to walk the line,

02:28.816 --> 02:31.919
so we approached the building
at high alert. I saw this guy

02:31.952 --> 02:34.322
over here behind this barricade
reach into his pocket,

02:34.355 --> 02:36.357
I'm thinking
he's going for a gun,

02:36.390 --> 02:38.226
turns out to be a cell phone.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.594
So I indicated that
the threat was a negative.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.230
Then, almost instantly...

02:42.263 --> 02:43.764
Shot was fired?
Yeah.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.266
Security team leader's
getting the admiral

02:45.299 --> 02:46.767
flown to Gulfport.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.203
Chopper should be setting
down in 15 minutes.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.638
Any idea where
the shot came from?
Sounded like

02:50.671 --> 02:52.373
it came from
across Royal.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.807
I'm thinking we start
with the yellow building and

02:53.841 --> 02:55.843
sweep
the upper floors.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.380
What's the body
tell us, Loretta?

02:59.413 --> 03:01.749
Agent Austin Hackett

03:01.782 --> 03:04.885
suffered a fatal gunshot wound
in his upper chest cavity.

03:06.887 --> 03:07.988
Caliber of weapon?

03:08.021 --> 03:09.523
Well, it's tough to tell

03:09.557 --> 03:11.392
on preliminary examination.
There's

03:11.425 --> 03:13.627
no point of exit,
so the bullet's

03:13.661 --> 03:16.264
probably still lodged
in Agent Hackett's body.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.831
Once I get him
on my table,

03:17.865 --> 03:19.533
I'll be able to x-ray,

03:19.567 --> 03:21.802
locate the slug and identify it.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.538
Seemed like a good guy.

03:24.572 --> 03:25.873
From here,

03:25.906 --> 03:27.575
originally.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.877
Nothing you could've done.

03:29.910 --> 03:32.446
Christopher,

03:32.480 --> 03:34.382
get on the witnesses. Brody,

03:34.415 --> 03:36.550
interface with NOPD
and get a sweep going.

03:36.584 --> 03:37.751
First thing
we got to do is

03:37.785 --> 03:39.019
figure out where
the shot came from.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.888
Right.

03:43.857 --> 03:46.527
LASALLE: Based on
various witness accounts,

03:46.560 --> 03:48.396
appears Brody was
right-- shot came from

03:48.429 --> 03:50.398
yellow building
across Royal Street.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.965
And the sweep?
Basement to roof.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.867
Came up empty.
Whoever pulled the trigger

03:53.901 --> 03:55.469
covered their
tracks well.
We're gonna

03:55.503 --> 03:57.271
try and use facial
mapping to identify

03:57.305 --> 03:58.672
as many of the
protesters as possible.

03:58.706 --> 04:01.509
Members Union Local 445.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.311
Worked at
the shipyard.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.279
Their contract wasn't renewed
when the admiral

04:05.313 --> 04:07.948
awarded the Destroyer
project to Charleston.

04:07.981 --> 04:10.984
Any threats prior
to the protest?
The admiral is

04:11.018 --> 04:12.520
currently on the hit list

04:12.553 --> 04:14.555
of both Boko Haram
and the Aryan Nation.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.390
PATTON:
If I were still a betting man,

04:16.424 --> 04:19.693
which I haven't been
since the summer of 2011,

04:19.727 --> 04:21.962
I'd stick to the union angle.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.697
Got something?

04:23.731 --> 04:26.066
Went crack-a-hacking various
union e-mail accounts.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.068
Came across this doozy

04:28.101 --> 04:30.471
sent amongst the ranks.

04:30.504 --> 04:33.474
Came from union distro
e-mail account.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.842
As far as I can tell,

04:34.875 --> 04:37.345
this was sent from
inside headquarters.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.347
445 union leader is...

04:39.380 --> 04:41.014
Tommy City.
He was waiting inside the hall

04:41.048 --> 04:42.616
to meet with the admiral.

04:42.650 --> 04:43.817
Go talk to him.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.319
See what he knows
and who has access

04:45.353 --> 04:46.420
to the union's
accounts?

04:46.454 --> 04:47.988
Please and
thank you.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.757
Still need to conduct

04:49.790 --> 04:51.091
my after-action interview

04:51.124 --> 04:52.860
with Agent Brody.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.495
Happy to do so,
but I think I should

04:54.528 --> 04:55.629
follow up with this first.
Hold up

04:55.663 --> 04:56.630
a sec on that,
will you?

04:56.664 --> 04:57.765
Can we speak?

04:57.798 --> 05:00.368
In private?

05:00.401 --> 05:03.571
I'd like Agent Brody to do
her after-action interview

05:03.604 --> 05:06.106
before going
into the field.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.709
She briefed me
on what happened.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.644
Followed protocol.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.513
You're not going to
find anything there.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.515
Seems to me the
paperwork can wait

05:14.548 --> 05:16.517
until we're further down
the road with the murder
investigation.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.419
I respectfully disagree,

05:18.452 --> 05:20.988
and I'm receiving my orders
from Director Vance.

05:21.021 --> 05:23.391
After something
like today,

05:23.424 --> 05:24.958
you got to question
everything and everyone

05:24.992 --> 05:26.594
involved in the detail.

05:28.462 --> 05:31.399
Came across a file
in Agent Brody's jacket.

05:31.432 --> 05:33.967
Were you aware of the incident
on the USS Moultrie

05:34.001 --> 05:36.404
when she was an agent afloat?

05:36.437 --> 05:38.806
Fully aware.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.974
Do you know she hesitated
when she saw the bomber?

05:41.008 --> 05:42.410
I read
the file.

05:42.443 --> 05:43.844
Moultrie investigation showed

05:43.877 --> 05:46.680
Agent Brody's slight hesitation

05:46.714 --> 05:48.682
had no bearing
on the explosion.

05:48.716 --> 05:49.883
Bottom line,

05:49.917 --> 05:51.752
this is twice people have died

05:51.785 --> 05:53.487
on Agent Brody's watch.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.689
I want to find out
what happened this morning.

05:55.723 --> 05:57.991
And I'm equally intent
on finding out

05:58.025 --> 06:00.628
what Agent Brody did
or did not do

06:00.661 --> 06:02.630
on the USS Moultrie.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.767
Start again.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.101
What happened just before

06:08.135 --> 06:10.538
you veered from the
admiral's flank?

06:10.571 --> 06:13.607
I veered
because I saw a credible threat.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.509
Called it out.

06:15.543 --> 06:17.177
Moved in to assess it further.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.080
Would you have
preferred I did nothing?

06:20.113 --> 06:22.883
I would have preferred
you keep the admiral safe.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.918
He is safe.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.554
And Agent Hackett?

06:28.088 --> 06:29.523
Look...

06:29.557 --> 06:31.425
I'd like to be out there

06:31.459 --> 06:33.093
looking for
Agent Hackett's killer.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.662
Feel free to play back the tapes

06:34.695 --> 06:36.530
of the first three times
we went over this.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.666
My story is not changing.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.534
And what about your story

06:40.568 --> 06:42.703
about what happened
on the USS Moultrie?

06:44.838 --> 06:47.741
I admire the tactic.

06:47.775 --> 06:49.777
Badger me for 40 minutes

06:49.810 --> 06:51.612
in the hopes that
I'll be distracted

06:51.645 --> 06:53.881
when you get to what
you really care about.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.016
Of the five men
that died on the Moultrie,

06:56.049 --> 06:57.217
I served with two.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.619
They were friends.

06:58.652 --> 07:01.489
So, yes, I do care.

07:01.522 --> 07:02.656
Sit.

07:06.927 --> 07:11.732
September 2, 2007.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.167
You were
the agent afloat

07:14.201 --> 07:17.538
when disgruntled Petty Officer
3rd class Jerry Hooper

07:17.571 --> 07:19.072
strapped
an improvised

07:19.106 --> 07:21.008
explosive to his chest,

07:21.041 --> 07:23.043
tried to make his way
to the command center.

07:23.076 --> 07:26.747
You encountered Hooper
in the mission bay.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.650
BRODY:
NCIS! Stop!

07:29.683 --> 07:31.919
Had a clear shot
to take him down, but...

07:31.952 --> 07:33.186
you hesitated.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.888
So tell me this:

07:34.922 --> 07:36.524
Why didn't you fire

07:36.557 --> 07:37.825
when you had a clean shot...

07:41.194 --> 07:43.697
Agent Brody?

07:44.832 --> 07:46.567
:
Agent Brody?

07:47.835 --> 07:49.637
Answer the question.

07:49.670 --> 07:52.706
If you want to officially
reopen the investigation,

07:52.740 --> 07:54.074
go ahead.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.943
Till then...

07:55.976 --> 07:58.712
I am going back to work.

08:10.758 --> 08:12.259
LASALLE: This photo was sent
from your headquarters.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.127
CITY:
Suggesting I sent this?

08:14.161 --> 08:15.563
Insult on top of injury.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.798
You guys take our jobs
and then you accuse us

08:17.831 --> 08:20.067
of trying
to assassinate an admiral?

08:20.100 --> 08:22.603
The threat came from
inside your union office.

08:22.636 --> 08:23.804
Someone besides me.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.105
I wouldn't know where to begin

08:25.138 --> 08:26.674
to put something
like this together.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.709
My girl, Angie,
she sends all my e-mails,

08:28.742 --> 08:30.678
and there's no way
I know how to...

08:30.711 --> 08:33.714
photo-whatever a target
on that ass's face.

08:33.747 --> 08:34.982
But you were
aware of it

08:35.015 --> 08:36.750
and you didn't notify
the authorities.

08:36.784 --> 08:39.219
Thought it was just one of
my guys letting off some steam.

08:39.252 --> 08:40.788
There's a lot of anger.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.322
People's lives screwed.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.091
Any screwed
more than others?

08:44.124 --> 08:45.559
Look around.

08:45.593 --> 08:47.561
Used to be 200 people
working here.

08:47.595 --> 08:49.930
Now I got skeleton crews
packing the place up.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.665
People lost their homes.

08:51.699 --> 08:52.866
Families ripped apart.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.568
Desperate times.

08:54.602 --> 08:56.236
Which may have called
for desperate measures.

08:56.269 --> 08:59.239
Look, as upset as I am
at this Admiral Pack,

08:59.272 --> 09:01.341
in no way do I condone
what happened.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.612
And I feel like crap for the guy
that got shot, his family.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.279
"The guy" was
Austin Hackett.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.015
We're gonna need
access to your servers

09:08.048 --> 09:09.883
and a list of people

09:09.917 --> 09:11.619
who would've been able
to get into the union's office

09:11.652 --> 09:14.287
the day the e-mail was sent.

09:14.321 --> 09:18.258
Angie, I need your help with
that damn computer again.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.093
I was able to locate the slug

09:20.127 --> 09:22.295
in Agent Hackett's
T-4 vertebrae.

09:22.329 --> 09:25.699
Bullet's a .30-30 Winchester,

09:25.733 --> 09:28.836
most commonly found
in various hunting rifles.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.103
The distance
between the building

09:30.137 --> 09:31.739
where the shot came from

09:31.772 --> 09:33.707
and Hackett was over 500 feet.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.709
About 166 yards.

09:35.743 --> 09:36.910
Single kill shot
at that distance,

09:36.944 --> 09:38.746
not easy for a .30-30.

09:38.779 --> 09:41.181
You know, when the Chen Lon gang
in China had John Lennon killed,

09:41.214 --> 09:44.251
they made sure that Mark David
Chapman had point-blank access.

09:44.284 --> 09:45.986
Really?
The Chinese?

09:46.019 --> 09:47.621
Yeah. Later, I'll show
you the evidence.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.322
So we're looking for someone

09:49.356 --> 09:51.725
with significant
hunting experience.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.661
And because we haven't
pinpointed the exact location

09:53.694 --> 09:55.328
in the building
where the shot came from,

09:55.362 --> 09:56.797
I'm working up a simulation.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.331
Oh, look out!

09:58.365 --> 10:00.801
Mr. Lund has himself
a grassy knoll.

10:00.834 --> 10:04.071
All right, let's...
don't start with me, "Double P."

10:04.104 --> 10:05.806
Oh, no, it's Triple P now.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.775
The third "P"
is for "perfection."

10:07.808 --> 10:09.643
SEBASTIAN:
We've been over this, okay?

10:09.677 --> 10:11.779
You cannot give yourself
a nickname.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.080
And here's where
we shut the screen off.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.648
Good-bye, Loretta.

10:14.682 --> 10:15.749
Bye, Dwayne.
Son of Sam gave himself...

10:15.783 --> 10:17.084
PATTON:
Are you ready to love

10:17.117 --> 10:18.952
the Triple P?

10:18.986 --> 10:20.921
Follow me.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.223
I went through the login
of everyone

10:23.256 --> 10:25.325
who signed into the computers
at the headquarters

10:25.358 --> 10:27.094
the night that e-mail was sent.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.829
Found this.

10:28.862 --> 10:31.699
Password-- HueyLeo81.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.433
Logged in 30 seconds prior.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.235
Logged off 15 seconds after.

10:35.268 --> 10:38.105
That e-mail belongs
to Shane Tash.

10:38.138 --> 10:41.341
Born May 26, 1981.

10:41.374 --> 10:44.211
Pet bulldogs--
Huey and Leo.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.246
Okay. Hunting experience?

10:46.279 --> 10:48.916
Damn, do I have
to do everything around here?

10:48.949 --> 10:50.851
Let me ask you something.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.920
Now, if I added another "P"
to my name,

10:52.953 --> 10:54.722
what would you like--

10:54.755 --> 10:56.256
"Passionate" or "playful"?

10:56.289 --> 11:00.728
Shane Tash has had a hunting
license for over 20 years.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.897
You want me to get Brody
and check out Tash?

11:05.498 --> 11:09.202
Anson really reopen the
investigation into Moultrie?

11:11.038 --> 11:13.340
She's been up there an hour.

11:13.373 --> 11:16.309
Could be another
couple hours.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.912
Let's go check out
this Tash fellow.

11:24.217 --> 11:25.886
Sorry, fellas.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.055
Ain't gonna talk to anyone
involved in with Navy

11:28.088 --> 11:30.057
after what y'all done to us.

11:30.090 --> 11:31.424
You may not
want to talk,

11:31.458 --> 11:34.127
but we think whoever
signed in as HueyLeo81...

11:36.196 --> 11:37.898
...probably should.

11:37.931 --> 11:40.033
It was a nasty piece of work,
that e-mail you sent.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.434
Not as nasty as Admiral Pack.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.436
Whoa!

11:43.470 --> 11:45.305
What about Admiral Pack?

11:45.338 --> 11:47.074
Word around the union,
he was getting kickbacks

11:47.107 --> 11:50.177
from a company in Charleston
for the shipping contracts, too.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.445
We don't care about your
conspiracy theories.

11:52.479 --> 11:53.947
We care about
your whereabouts

11:53.981 --> 11:55.348
at the time of the shooting.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.885
I was here.
Anyone to corroborate that?

11:57.918 --> 11:59.219
Place was a ghost town.

11:59.252 --> 12:00.954
Everybody was out
picketing the admiral.

12:00.988 --> 12:02.155
That's convenient.

12:02.189 --> 12:03.924
Check my timecard if you want.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.292
Clocked in at 8:00 a.m.

12:05.325 --> 12:08.896
Clocked in at 8:00 a.m.,
walked out the front door.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.330
20 minutes to the courthouse.

12:10.363 --> 12:13.867
Still leaves you 40 minutes
before the shot rang out.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.135
You got nothing on me.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.337
Now, if you don't mind,
I got to tear down

12:17.370 --> 12:19.439
the rest of this equipment
and ship it to China.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.241
You threatened a Naval
officer by e-mail,

12:21.274 --> 12:23.010
and that's a
federal offense.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.978
You're going with us
back to your house

12:25.012 --> 12:27.347
and handing over
all your rifles.

12:29.049 --> 12:31.018
Were you dropped
on your head as a child?

12:31.051 --> 12:33.453
Please don't tell me
you buy the government's story.

12:33.486 --> 12:35.789
Kennedy was obviously killed
by the Chicago Mob.

12:35.823 --> 12:39.092
Evidence.
Show me some ev-i-dence.

12:39.126 --> 12:40.961
PRIDE:
Patton, what are you doing here?

12:40.994 --> 12:42.462
Man, the second
I heard Sebastian

12:42.495 --> 12:44.798
was down here trying
to recreate an assassination,

12:44.832 --> 12:46.333
I came to try
to keep him focused.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.068
Doesn't seem to be working.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.838
Well, neither is the
theory about Shane Tash.
What?

12:50.871 --> 12:53.006
Ballistics didn't
match any of his guns.
PATTON: Yeah.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.976
But we're making good progress
on where the shot came from.

12:56.009 --> 12:58.111
Based on the angle
of Agent Hackett's entry wound,

12:58.145 --> 13:00.113
and, uh, the affect of
wind speed and gravity

13:00.147 --> 13:03.951
on the bullet's velocity,
I was able to determine

13:03.984 --> 13:06.553
that the shot was fired from
the third story, corner window

13:06.586 --> 13:09.122
of the building
across Royal Street.

13:09.156 --> 13:12.392
Now, that discovery
lead to a cool theory.

13:12.425 --> 13:15.128
Really, really cool.

13:15.162 --> 13:17.564
I just said that it was cool.

13:17.597 --> 13:19.499
Yeah, but I added
a couple of reallys,

13:19.532 --> 13:22.002
and I said, "cool,"
which is so much more cooler

13:22.035 --> 13:23.270
than the way you said it.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.372
The theory, please.

13:25.405 --> 13:30.010
Yeah, so, imagine for a moment
that this box is the courthouse.

13:30.043 --> 13:32.312
Okay.
All right, these
are the protestors.

13:32.345 --> 13:35.115
This is the building
across Royal.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.117
And this is the shooter.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.119
Now, if my lab
assistant would hand me

13:39.152 --> 13:41.855
Randall the Robot, please.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.556
You know what?

13:43.590 --> 13:46.126
Lab assistant is not cool.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.861
Randall is Admiral Pack.

13:47.895 --> 13:50.463
Myron the Monkey
is Agent Hackett.

13:50.497 --> 13:53.433
And Cornelius the Clown

13:53.466 --> 13:55.035
is the statue
of Supreme Court Judge

13:55.068 --> 13:57.104
Edward Douglass White,

13:57.137 --> 13:59.206
or more commonly known
as Big Green Ed.

13:59.239 --> 14:02.342
This laser pointer represents
the shooter's direction.

14:02.375 --> 14:05.412
Turn it on...
tell me what you see.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.186
Killer's line of sight
was obstructed by the statue.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.922
And yet, a full minute before,

14:14.955 --> 14:16.489
when the admiral
was unobstructed...

14:16.523 --> 14:18.125
Killer didn't fire.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.160
I'm beginning to wonder
if this is really

14:20.193 --> 14:21.494
about assassinating
Admiral Pack.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.364
PRIDE:
Or maybe...

14:24.397 --> 14:28.335
Agent Hackett was the target
all along.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.079
Tell me things.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.580
We figure
if Hackett's the target,

14:40.613 --> 14:42.449
probably rules out the union.

14:42.482 --> 14:45.485
No ties there, so we started
digging into him personally.

14:45.518 --> 14:48.155
Dumped his financials.
No red flags.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.290
Nothing in his
NCIS jacket.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.925
Guy's clean as whistle.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.426
What's interesting is,
Hackett told me

14:53.460 --> 14:56.463
he specifically requested
to be on this detail.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.198
Yeah, he was supposed
to be protecting

14:58.231 --> 15:00.333
the Commandant of the Marine
Corps in San Diego this week.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.135
Fought to get himself
reassigned,

15:02.169 --> 15:03.703
sent a series of
e-mails requesting

15:03.736 --> 15:06.339
to protect Admiral Pack,
so he could come home.

15:06.373 --> 15:08.141
He got family?

15:08.175 --> 15:10.177
LASALLE: His parents
died ten years ago.

15:10.210 --> 15:11.678
His brother lives in Sarasota.

15:11.711 --> 15:13.480
We dumped his cell.

15:13.513 --> 15:16.283
He made a phone call
to a Rebirth Boxing Gym

15:16.316 --> 15:19.219
in the Ninth Ward at 6:00 p.m.
the night before his death.

15:19.252 --> 15:23.090
Another couple calls to
and from State Senator Klain

15:23.123 --> 15:25.625
around 10:00 p.m.
the same night.
William Klain?

15:25.658 --> 15:28.628
Yup, also, another number
we couldn't I.D.--

15:28.661 --> 15:30.363
720 area code.

15:30.397 --> 15:31.364
Out of state?

15:31.398 --> 15:32.966
Colorado.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.335
One incoming the night
before he died around 8:45.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.370
Six outgoing the morning of.

15:37.404 --> 15:40.373
Then another call from that
same number three weeks ago.

15:40.407 --> 15:43.210
When he lobbied
to get the detail.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.112
All right, let's have Patton

15:45.145 --> 15:47.380
get to work
on the 720 number,

15:47.414 --> 15:49.249
see what he can find out.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.551
Brody?

15:55.155 --> 15:58.058
Brody?

15:58.091 --> 16:00.260
Colorado number. Got it.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.262
Chris...

16:02.295 --> 16:03.997
check out the boxing gym.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.732
Brody, you're with me.

16:05.765 --> 16:09.569
Let's go, uh, pay a visit

16:09.602 --> 16:12.139
to Senator Klain.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.377
How'd it go
with Agent Anson?

16:17.410 --> 16:19.312
I answered his questions.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.314
All he seems to care
about is the Moultrie

16:21.348 --> 16:24.651
and why I hesitated.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.119
It's personal.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.720
I know.
And...

16:27.754 --> 16:29.456
since they determined
that it had nothing to do

16:29.489 --> 16:31.724
with the deaths and since
nothing like that has ever

16:31.758 --> 16:34.094
happened again, then there's
really... there's no reason
I get it.

16:34.127 --> 16:36.529
for us to go get this...
I get it. I do. I...

16:36.563 --> 16:40.733
But... Anson's talking
about barring you from

16:40.767 --> 16:42.602
the protective
detail list.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.671
If you want,

16:44.704 --> 16:46.506
I'll call the director.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.275
I'll shut this down.

16:48.308 --> 16:50.077
I'll save you both the trouble,
and I'll take myself

16:50.110 --> 16:52.145
off the protective detail list.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.746
Or...

16:53.780 --> 16:57.184
you could ask for
a transfer to, say...

16:57.217 --> 16:59.152
the Northwest office.

16:59.186 --> 17:03.423
I never said anything
about going to the Northwest.
No.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.258
But...

17:05.292 --> 17:08.461
run away from the Midwest,

17:08.495 --> 17:10.297
you run away from the Moultrie.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.599
I'm just wondering how long
it's gonna be before I find

17:12.632 --> 17:16.536
a request for... reassignment
on my desk.

17:19.272 --> 17:22.709
"Skim Milk." It was Hackett's
nickname back in high school.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.112
We had a gang.
Not a real gang.

17:25.145 --> 17:27.847
Just a joke.
We were the Milk Trucks.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.783
He was Skim 'cause he was
100 pounds, soaking wet.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.852
I was Spilled Milk.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.721
Always wanted to
say to the girls,

17:34.754 --> 17:36.589
"Don't cry over
Spilled Milk."

17:36.623 --> 17:38.391
Bycer here...

17:38.425 --> 17:41.261
2%.
I'm a little Native American.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.430
So you guys
were close?

17:43.463 --> 17:45.432
We were beyond close.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.167
Best friends.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.801
He and I were trying
to figure out a time

17:48.835 --> 17:50.403
that we could
get together.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.172
Wanted to see
if I could

17:52.205 --> 17:54.307
convince him
to, uh...

17:54.341 --> 17:57.310
come aboard my run for
the governorship as an advisor.

17:57.344 --> 17:58.811
But, uh,

17:58.845 --> 18:02.415
our schedules
didn't line up and...

18:02.449 --> 18:05.552
He's just... He's gone.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.822
My wife, Justine, and I, um...

18:09.856 --> 18:11.691
Austin's brother

18:11.724 --> 18:14.394
has asked for us
to organize the wake.

18:14.427 --> 18:17.730
I'm sorry
for your loss, Senator.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.433
I have to ask--
do you know of anyone

18:20.467 --> 18:23.170
who might've had a problem
with Agent Hackett?

18:23.203 --> 18:24.871
To the point
that they'd shoot him?

18:24.904 --> 18:28.875
Austin was beloved.

18:28.908 --> 18:31.311
By everyone.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.813
Well, how 'bout this?

18:33.846 --> 18:37.884
Several calls to an unknown
Colorado phone number.

18:37.917 --> 18:40.420
Mean anything?
Doesn't look familiar.

18:40.453 --> 18:44.357
How about a call
from the Rebirth Boxing Gym?

18:44.391 --> 18:46.793
That's Moke's joint, right?

18:47.860 --> 18:50.430
Moke...

18:51.464 --> 18:53.466
...might want to kill Austin.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.269
KLAIN:
David Mockus.

18:56.303 --> 18:58.405
Knew him since kindergarten.

18:58.438 --> 19:01.274
He was in a real gang.

19:01.308 --> 19:04.877
Our, uh... pot guy.

19:04.911 --> 19:08.515
Officially,
I didn't inhale either.

19:08.548 --> 19:12.252
When we all graduated,
uh, Moke did, too--

19:12.285 --> 19:14.521
to much bigger crimes.

19:14.554 --> 19:15.888
He started running weapons

19:15.922 --> 19:18.358
for one of the biggest
gunrunners in the city.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.227
When Moke got busted,

19:20.260 --> 19:23.730
Austin stepped up as the
prosecution's key witness.

19:23.763 --> 19:27.967
It was... his tough love way
of trying to get Moke straight.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.237
Did Mr. Mockus see it that way?

19:30.270 --> 19:32.672
Would you?

19:39.011 --> 19:40.680
I spoke with Hackett.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.515
So what?

19:42.549 --> 19:46.919
Shooting the breeze with the guy
that helped put you in prison?

19:46.953 --> 19:48.921
A lot happened since then.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.790
I did my time.

19:50.823 --> 19:54.261
I saw the error of my ways.

19:54.294 --> 19:55.895
What'd you talk about?

19:55.928 --> 19:58.698
Bunnies, unicorns, lollipops.

20:00.900 --> 20:04.904
Yeah, that's pretty funny for
a guy with motive to kill.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.906
Is that your office?

20:06.939 --> 20:08.375
Yeah.

20:08.408 --> 20:09.776
So?

20:09.809 --> 20:11.844
Well, I'm guessing
that's your safe.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.680
Bet if I pop
that sucker open,

20:13.713 --> 20:15.915
a lot of guns
is gonna fall out of there.

20:16.949 --> 20:17.984
How's that gonna sit

20:18.017 --> 20:19.686
with the terms of your parole?

20:21.854 --> 20:24.291
Not well.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.959
After the bunnies and unicorns,

20:26.993 --> 20:29.362
what else was on the docket?

20:29.396 --> 20:31.598
Wanted a gun.

20:31.631 --> 20:35.268
Why would an NCIS agent
come to you for a gun?

20:35.302 --> 20:36.836
Not a question I ask.

20:36.869 --> 20:39.272
He said he
wanted it light

20:39.306 --> 20:40.907
and untraceable.

20:40.940 --> 20:43.943
Say who it was for?

20:43.976 --> 20:46.012
Rey.

20:46.045 --> 20:47.414
Who's Rey?

20:47.447 --> 20:48.948
BRODY:
Reagan Norris.

20:48.981 --> 20:51.951
Went to the same high school
as Hackett and Klain.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.686
Waitress at Pat O's.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.356
Married eight years.
Seven-year-old son.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.024
Yearbook pictures showed
Reagan and Hackett together

20:58.057 --> 21:00.293
in student council,
school paper,

21:00.327 --> 21:02.895
even Glee Club.
Glee Club?

21:02.929 --> 21:05.565
Only reason a guy does that
is to get next to the girl.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.368
Mockus said he met
with Hackett around 8:30.

21:08.401 --> 21:10.970
That 720 number came in
around 8:45.

21:11.003 --> 21:13.306
All right, if it's
Reagan's cell,

21:13.340 --> 21:14.707
why has she got
a Colorado number?

21:14.741 --> 21:17.444
I'm thinking second phone.
Called both,

21:17.477 --> 21:18.978
went to voicemail.
Patton did say

21:19.011 --> 21:20.980
they had simultaneous
credit card charges

21:21.013 --> 21:23.583
between Reagan and Hackett,
up here at B.J.'s.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.818
Yeah, they came in
a couple nights ago.

21:25.852 --> 21:28.321
Were sittin' in that corner.

21:28.355 --> 21:30.323
LASALLE:
They leave together?

21:30.357 --> 21:32.091
Well, I'm not sure.

21:32.124 --> 21:35.962
But my manager punched up the
outside security cams for you.

21:36.996 --> 21:39.332
Man, I...

21:39.366 --> 21:40.833
I never know
how to work this equipment.

21:40.867 --> 21:42.435
Oh, I got this.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.103
Any chance you heard
what they were talking about?

21:44.136 --> 21:46.806
Uh, joint can be loud.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.875
But I can tell you this,

21:48.908 --> 21:51.411
they looked cozy.

21:51.444 --> 21:52.945
At one point, he leaned over--

21:52.979 --> 21:54.681
I thought he was going in
for the kiss--

21:54.714 --> 21:57.350
dropped something in her purse.

21:57.384 --> 21:58.785
Did it look like a gun?

21:58.818 --> 22:00.653
Mm...

22:00.687 --> 22:02.655
Well, I didn't see it, but...

22:02.689 --> 22:04.791
gun is sexy.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.559
You carry a gun,
right?

22:06.593 --> 22:08.695
I think we have everything
we need from you. Thank you.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.062
Oh.

22:10.096 --> 22:12.098
I'll be in the other room.

22:14.133 --> 22:16.503
Got 'em leaving the bar.

22:16.536 --> 22:19.706
BRODY: Reagan and Hackett.

22:21.741 --> 22:24.076
LASALLE: Now who's that?

22:25.712 --> 22:27.847
Rewind.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.115
Freeze on his face.

22:31.083 --> 22:32.519
That's not Mockus.

22:32.552 --> 22:33.319
I know that face--

22:33.352 --> 22:36.556
from the research
we did on Reagan.

22:38.491 --> 22:40.460
Her husband.

22:40.493 --> 22:41.894
Alec Norris.

22:43.696 --> 22:44.997
LASALLE:
What if Hackett and Reagan

22:45.031 --> 22:46.566
was having an affair?

22:46.599 --> 22:48.601
They're worried
about the husband finding out.

22:48.635 --> 22:50.603
Hackett gets her a gun
for protection,

22:50.637 --> 22:52.071
he shows up...

22:52.104 --> 22:53.640
something goes down.

22:53.673 --> 22:55.508
The husband uses the threats
at the protest

22:55.542 --> 22:57.043
to make Hackett pay.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.681
Alec Norris.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.416
The husband.

23:03.450 --> 23:05.151
Is he credible for
this kind of a killing?

23:05.184 --> 23:07.887
Electrician.
Works for a local contractor.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.423
No priors. Had a hunting license
since 2001.

23:10.457 --> 23:11.824
Any domestic
issues?

23:11.858 --> 23:14.427
NOPD got a 911 call
to the house two days ago.

23:14.461 --> 23:17.664
Police showed up, but Reagan
refused to press charges.

23:22.502 --> 23:23.536
Open door.

23:29.476 --> 23:31.778
NCIS.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.625
Clear.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.927
Clear.

23:50.863 --> 23:52.164
BRODY:
Clear.

23:55.602 --> 23:57.737
Find anything?
LASALLE:
Nothing.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.839
Someone left in a hurry.

23:59.872 --> 24:01.708
Well, if the husband
killed Hackett,

24:01.741 --> 24:03.175
it makes sense he'd run.

24:03.209 --> 24:04.777
If Reagan feared for her life,

24:04.811 --> 24:06.746
might've fled with their son.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.815
If she did, we better start
looking at hospitals.

24:09.882 --> 24:12.785
Son's name is Dylan.

24:15.922 --> 24:17.089
Sick.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.860
Really sick, from the looks
of this equipment.

24:20.893 --> 24:23.496
Seen this
at the children's hospital.

24:23.530 --> 24:25.598
Also found
this medication, lactulose.

24:25.632 --> 24:26.999
You know what it's for?

24:27.033 --> 24:28.668
No.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.604
All right,
we got a missing woman,

24:31.638 --> 24:33.873
potential killer,
and now a sick kid.

24:33.906 --> 24:35.775
Let's find

24:35.808 --> 24:38.511
these people-- fast.

24:47.787 --> 24:51.090
I pulled a favor from a friend
over at Children's Hospital.

24:51.123 --> 24:55.828
The son, Dylan Norris,
has hepatic angiosarcoma.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.930
It's cancer of the blood
vessels in the liver.

24:57.964 --> 24:59.599
Is the condition
treatable?

24:59.632 --> 25:02.101
Only if someone donates
a part of their liver.

25:02.134 --> 25:06.973
The lactulose is used to try
and control high ammonia levels

25:07.006 --> 25:08.641
until a donor is found.

25:08.675 --> 25:10.643
So the kid should be
in a hospital?

25:10.677 --> 25:12.645
Oh, that won't
do any good.

25:12.679 --> 25:14.714
He'll just get sicker
and sicker.

25:14.747 --> 25:16.716
It could be a matter of weeks,

25:16.749 --> 25:18.250
could be months...

25:18.284 --> 25:20.587
Well, it's hard to say

25:20.620 --> 25:22.689
because I don't have full access
to his file.

25:22.722 --> 25:24.557
We'll get a warrant.
See if the murder investigation

25:24.591 --> 25:27.059
can get past the HIPAA laws.
Thank you.

25:27.093 --> 25:28.761
You all right, Merri?

25:28.795 --> 25:31.998
Yeah. Fine. Why?

25:32.031 --> 25:36.268
Just notice a... little bit
of your light has gone out.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.772
I'm just, um...

25:39.806 --> 25:42.675
I'm... dealing with something.

25:43.843 --> 25:44.744
Merri...

25:44.777 --> 25:47.046
how I see this space...

25:47.079 --> 25:49.782
it's my temple.

25:49.816 --> 25:52.952
And all who enter here
are afforded solace

25:52.985 --> 25:54.721
and protection.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.089
That goes for both the dead

25:57.123 --> 25:58.725
as well as the living.

26:04.096 --> 26:06.933
I made a mistake once.

26:06.966 --> 26:07.834
NCIS!

26:07.867 --> 26:09.101
Stop!

26:09.135 --> 26:11.804
For six-tenths of a second.

26:12.872 --> 26:14.040
Six-tenths of a second,

26:14.073 --> 26:16.375
and I have been obsessing on it

26:16.408 --> 26:19.211
for... close to eight years.

26:24.150 --> 26:28.821
Everyone always accuses me
of running,

26:28.855 --> 26:31.257
but there is a difference
between running

26:31.290 --> 26:34.694
and trying to put something
behind you.

26:34.727 --> 26:37.263
There is.

26:37.296 --> 26:41.100
But if you keep avoiding
that "something,"

26:41.133 --> 26:44.070
people wonder if you still have
your track pants

26:44.103 --> 26:46.639
and jogging shoes on.

26:55.047 --> 26:58.017
PATTON:
Assuming Reagan was having
an affair with Hackett,

26:58.050 --> 26:59.652
I've been working
the Colorado number to see

26:59.686 --> 27:01.420
if we can use it
to locate Reagan.

27:01.453 --> 27:03.823
"My Alias" is a service used
by philanderers

27:03.856 --> 27:05.424
to generate a second number
on a phone,

27:05.457 --> 27:07.694
without requiring
an additional SIM card.

27:07.727 --> 27:09.696
Reagan Norris
has one?
Yeah, you toggle

27:09.729 --> 27:11.831
between numbers,
you turn one number off,

27:11.864 --> 27:14.166
set your privacy settings so
you don't get caught cheating.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.769
Man, if they would've invented
that five years ago, I'd still

27:16.803 --> 27:18.905
be married.

27:18.938 --> 27:21.708
Anyway, once I confirmed
it was Reagan's phone,

27:21.741 --> 27:24.711
I got a hit on a tower
in Gretna, near Business 90.

27:24.744 --> 27:26.312
LASALLE:
Oasis Motel.

27:26.345 --> 27:27.780
Reagan could be hiding
out there.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.181
And have Dylan with her.

27:29.215 --> 27:32.184
All right,
forward this info to Brody.

27:32.218 --> 27:34.186
Tell her to meet us...

27:34.220 --> 27:36.222
at the Oasis Motel.

27:36.255 --> 27:39.058
BRODY: Which room?
PRIDE: 37.

27:39.091 --> 27:41.060
Desk clerk said that Reagan

27:41.093 --> 27:43.295
came in two nights ago.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.297
Paid cash.

27:45.331 --> 27:48.400
Requested to be notified
if her husband showed up.

27:48.434 --> 27:49.936
Did she have Dylan with her?

27:49.969 --> 27:52.404
Clerk didn't see him.

27:52.438 --> 27:54.907
Eyes open, everyone.

27:58.210 --> 28:00.980
NCIS. Open up.

28:07.453 --> 28:09.989
Anybody here?

28:13.392 --> 28:15.194
PRIDE:
Clear.
LASALLE: Clear.

28:15.227 --> 28:16.896
BRODY:
Clear.

28:16.929 --> 28:18.330
LASALLE:
They got prison cells

28:18.364 --> 28:20.066
in Angola that's nicer
than this.

28:20.099 --> 28:21.267
PRIDE:
No bags.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.201
Bed's made.

28:23.069 --> 28:24.904
Room's awful neat.

28:24.937 --> 28:26.005
Guys...

28:27.139 --> 28:28.808
Placement of
this dresser is off.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.412
Indentation marks
in the carpet

28:33.445 --> 28:35.314
where it used to sit.

28:35.347 --> 28:36.816
Yeah, let's move it.

28:38.150 --> 28:39.118
Ready?
Yep.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.988
Go...

28:42.021 --> 28:43.422
LASALLE:
Got something.

28:47.159 --> 28:48.127
Bleach.

28:48.160 --> 28:48.995
Brody, get your...

28:49.028 --> 28:51.864
Bluestar.

28:55.868 --> 28:58.004
BRODY: Blood.

28:58.037 --> 29:00.973
PRIDE: So assume that the
husband tracked her to the hotel

29:01.007 --> 29:02.875
the same way
he tracked her to the bar.

29:02.909 --> 29:04.010
If the kid was
with her...

29:04.043 --> 29:04.977
Could've hurt him, too.

29:05.011 --> 29:06.145
Or taken him.

29:06.178 --> 29:07.513
LASALLE:
Thank you, fellas.

29:07.546 --> 29:09.849
K-9 search and
rescue's on its way.

29:09.882 --> 29:12.551
If Reagan's nearby,
they'll find her.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.053
Who are you calling?

29:14.086 --> 29:17.323
Just... playing a hunch.

29:51.623 --> 29:54.460
Damn it.

29:54.493 --> 29:56.095
WADE:
She had a gun in her handbag?

29:56.128 --> 29:57.363
PRIDE:
The one we believe Hackett

29:57.396 --> 29:58.597
gave to her for protection.

29:58.630 --> 30:01.200
WADE: Yeah.
Apparently not enough.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.569
Never fired.

30:03.602 --> 30:05.337
All bullets still
in the clip.

30:05.371 --> 30:07.206
Well, based on decomp,

30:07.239 --> 30:10.109
Reagan's been dead
approximately 48 hours.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.611
Same night as the
altercation at the bar.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.380
Cause of death?

30:14.413 --> 30:18.217
Oh, no poisons in her system
or stab wounds, but...

30:18.250 --> 30:20.086
based on the bruising
around her ear,

30:20.119 --> 30:23.522
I found she suffered
from a basilar skull fracture.

30:23.555 --> 30:28.995
Also has a small stress fracture
on her upper cheek,

30:29.028 --> 30:31.097
uh, most likely

30:31.130 --> 30:34.100
from being struck with a fist.

30:34.133 --> 30:36.635
My guess is, uh, she fell,

30:36.668 --> 30:38.337
hit her head on something.

30:38.370 --> 30:39.505
Could've been the dresser.

30:39.538 --> 30:40.973
Where you found the blood.

30:41.007 --> 30:43.642
Crime of passion?

30:43.675 --> 30:47.179
Quite. I've got
Dylan's medical records.

30:47.213 --> 30:49.515
Both his parents were tested
to donate,

30:49.548 --> 30:51.884
but there was
one little problem.

30:52.919 --> 30:55.888
Dylan's type A,

30:55.922 --> 30:58.991
and Reagan and Alec
are both type B.

30:59.025 --> 31:00.326
Forgive me, Loretta,

31:00.359 --> 31:02.328
long time since I took biology.

31:02.361 --> 31:05.531
How's it possible neither parent
matches their son's blood type?

31:05.564 --> 31:07.533
MAN:
It's not.

31:07.566 --> 31:09.435
I'm not Dylan's father.

31:10.937 --> 31:13.605
PRIDE: Mr. Norris...

31:13.639 --> 31:16.042
:
Is that her?

31:16.075 --> 31:17.276
Please say it isn't.

31:17.309 --> 31:19.111
Mr. Norris... Mr. Norris...
I'm sorry.

31:19.145 --> 31:20.947
No, I just,
I heard the re...

31:20.980 --> 31:23.015
report on the news and...

31:23.049 --> 31:24.416
and I didn't know
where I should go.

31:24.450 --> 31:26.285
I was hoping...

31:26.318 --> 31:28.120
that maybe it wasn't...
wasn't true.

31:28.154 --> 31:30.122
Where's your son?

31:30.156 --> 31:31.357
Where's your boy?

31:31.390 --> 31:33.125
Dad, what's going on?

31:33.159 --> 31:34.260
Dylan, you can't be in here.

31:34.293 --> 31:35.227
ALEC:
Wait, wait. No.

31:35.261 --> 31:36.562
I got him, Dwayne.

31:36.595 --> 31:39.198
DYLAN: Dad! Dad!
No, please, please...

31:39.231 --> 31:41.067
It's okay, it's gonna
be okay, Dylan.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.668
I didn't do this!

31:42.701 --> 31:45.037
You'll see,
I didn't do this!

31:56.382 --> 31:57.716
ALEC: It all started
a month ago.

31:58.684 --> 32:01.653
Dylan got sick?

32:01.687 --> 32:04.991
Rey and I both
went in to donate.

32:05.024 --> 32:10.129
When it came back that neither
of us was a match, I...

32:10.162 --> 32:13.399
I don't know, my mind... my mind
just started racing, you know?

32:15.367 --> 32:17.236
An affair?

32:19.038 --> 32:20.406
Yeah, well, uh, you know,

32:20.439 --> 32:22.674
we were pregnant basically
the moment that we met.

32:22.708 --> 32:25.677
Now I'm thinking
she-she probably already was,

32:25.711 --> 32:27.279
she just didn't tell me.

32:27.313 --> 32:28.614
You assumed it was Hackett?

32:28.647 --> 32:30.049
Seemed like a safe bet.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.085
And they stayed close.

32:33.119 --> 32:36.088
You know, she-she'd take these
trips to-to visit him.

32:36.122 --> 32:38.024
All of a sudden,
Hackett's back in town...

32:38.057 --> 32:39.625
Yeah, I lost it, I lost it.

32:39.658 --> 32:41.627
I attacked the guy,
outside the bar.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.329
I mean, sure, they both,
they both denied the affair,

32:43.362 --> 32:44.630
but that's
what people do, right?

32:44.663 --> 32:46.365
So screw it.

32:46.398 --> 32:48.367
I-I didn't want to, uh,
hear any more lies,

32:48.400 --> 32:51.370
so I-I... I just took off.

32:51.403 --> 32:54.306
Dylan and I, we got in the car,
and we went camping.

32:54.340 --> 32:56.308
Camping?

32:56.342 --> 32:59.311
Yeah.

32:59.345 --> 33:03.715
Dylan, he loves sleeping out
underneath the stars.

33:03.749 --> 33:06.018
Takes his mind off
what's going on.

33:07.353 --> 33:09.788
That's where I was
when Hackett was killed.

33:09.821 --> 33:12.558
I just needed
to-to cool off. I...

33:15.361 --> 33:17.329
Then I get back to town,
and I, uh...

33:17.363 --> 33:19.098
I saw the news.

33:19.131 --> 33:21.100
You know we're gonna
call the campground.

33:23.135 --> 33:24.803
If you're lying...
I-I'm not.

33:24.836 --> 33:27.506
I'm not lying.

33:27.539 --> 33:28.640
Look...

33:28.674 --> 33:31.477
I would never

33:31.510 --> 33:34.546
hurt Reagan.

33:34.580 --> 33:37.083
As for Hackett, I...

33:37.116 --> 33:39.118
hated that guy.

33:41.420 --> 33:44.723
But why am I gonna kill
the one man

33:44.756 --> 33:47.759
who might be able
to save my son's life?

33:50.596 --> 33:54.566
So I ran little Dylan's DNA
against Hackett's,

33:54.600 --> 33:57.669
and in the envelope,
I have the results of that test.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.271
Sebastian...

33:59.305 --> 34:01.140
But I can tell

34:01.173 --> 34:02.641
by your incredibly tense
body language

34:02.674 --> 34:05.177
that now is not
the time for theatrics, so...

34:05.211 --> 34:07.446
Agent Hackett
is not Dylan's father.

34:07.479 --> 34:08.680
Then who is?

34:08.714 --> 34:10.382
I ran Dylan's DNA

34:10.416 --> 34:12.084
through our criminal database,
came up empty.

34:12.118 --> 34:13.085
Thanks, Sebastian.

34:14.620 --> 34:18.290
What if Reagan told Hackett
who the father was?

34:18.324 --> 34:21.593
Then they were both killed
to keep the secret quiet.

34:21.627 --> 34:24.096
So... Dylan doesn't
stand a chance

34:24.130 --> 34:26.165
if we can't find
who his father is.

34:26.198 --> 34:28.334
That's why you pay me
the big bucks.

34:28.367 --> 34:30.336
Or at least you should.

34:30.369 --> 34:34.706
I was able to override
the password on Reagan's phone,

34:34.740 --> 34:38.410
download the incoming
and outgoing calls.

34:38.444 --> 34:40.412
I got her last call,

34:40.446 --> 34:42.448
the night she was killed.

34:45.684 --> 34:47.653
I got this.

34:47.686 --> 34:49.555
To Skim Milk.

34:50.889 --> 34:52.858
Austin, um...

34:52.891 --> 34:56.795
I would never be where I am
today, without you.

34:56.828 --> 34:59.565
You were my friend...

34:59.598 --> 35:01.333
my brother.

35:01.367 --> 35:02.634
Sweet Austin...

35:04.770 --> 35:05.804
...we will miss you.

35:05.837 --> 35:07.839
ALL:
Cheers.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.311
Agent Brody.

35:12.344 --> 35:14.313
Can I get you a drink?

35:14.346 --> 35:16.682
Uh, appreciated,
but I'm on the job.

35:16.715 --> 35:18.184
Understood.

35:18.217 --> 35:20.186
Senator Klain,
I need to ask

35:20.219 --> 35:21.853
the whereabouts
of your chief of staff.

35:21.887 --> 35:23.855
Edward?

35:23.889 --> 35:26.358
Another one of your high school
friends has been murdered.

35:26.392 --> 35:28.394
Reagan Norris.

35:30.462 --> 35:31.763
Reagan?

35:31.797 --> 35:33.332
Really?

35:33.365 --> 35:35.367
And there is an issue
of paternity

35:35.401 --> 35:37.236
with her child and Edward.

35:37.269 --> 35:39.638
We think Hackett might have
gotten caught up in it.

35:39.671 --> 35:43.475
Edward said that he had
to get out of town.
A family thing.

35:43.509 --> 35:46.512
Do you know
where he went?

35:46.545 --> 35:48.214
I can find out.

35:48.247 --> 35:50.249
That'd be great.

36:02.228 --> 36:04.796
DNA.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.798
Confirms you're
Dylan's father.

36:06.832 --> 36:08.334
But, of course,
we're not telling you

36:08.367 --> 36:10.969
anything you don't already know.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.971
Wait...

36:13.004 --> 36:15.307
I thought you were
looking into Edward.

36:15.341 --> 36:16.642
You wished.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.410
We just wanted to get
into your head,

36:18.444 --> 36:20.512
make sure you didn't walk away
with that glass.

36:24.550 --> 36:27.853
Okay, look...

36:27.886 --> 36:30.556
I had an affair with Reagan.

36:30.589 --> 36:33.259
But she never told me
that she was pregnant.

36:33.292 --> 36:34.793
You know that joke--

36:34.826 --> 36:36.495
how can you tell a
politician's lying?

36:36.528 --> 36:37.796
His lips are moving.

36:37.829 --> 36:39.398
PRIDE:
That's it.

36:39.431 --> 36:41.633
Save yourself the embarrassment.

36:44.970 --> 36:46.938
Let's check our math.

36:46.972 --> 36:48.940
Seven years ago,

36:48.974 --> 36:51.377
Klain gets
Reagan pregnant.

36:51.410 --> 36:53.945
But he's married,
star on the rise.

36:53.979 --> 36:56.615
Reagan agrees to keep
it secret, which works.

36:56.648 --> 36:59.918
Until Dylan gets sick.

36:59.951 --> 37:02.020
Then a month ago,
she calls Klain,

37:02.053 --> 37:04.390
asks him to get tested,
he says no.

37:04.423 --> 37:05.824
Because if he had
agreed to that,

37:05.857 --> 37:07.759
it's pretty much bye-bye
to his run for governorship.

37:07.793 --> 37:10.562
And so Reagan goes
to the one friend

37:10.596 --> 37:13.432
she thinks
can convince Klain

37:13.465 --> 37:16.635
to save his son,
Austin Hackett.

37:16.668 --> 37:18.637
And now two people know.

37:18.670 --> 37:20.439
So two people must die.

37:20.472 --> 37:21.940
No, wait, it wasn't...

37:21.973 --> 37:23.442
Reagan, she-she
threatened me.

37:23.475 --> 37:24.443
So I-I...

37:24.476 --> 37:25.577
I-I just, I-I snapped.

37:25.611 --> 37:26.578
That's all.

37:26.612 --> 37:27.713
"That's all," he says.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.916
Yeah, well, she couldn't have
threatened you too hard.

37:30.949 --> 37:32.951
'Cause the gun she had
in her pocket for protection

37:32.984 --> 37:34.320
was never fired.

37:34.353 --> 37:35.921
And with Reagan dead,

37:35.954 --> 37:38.390
Hackett would have known exactly
who was behind the murder.

37:38.424 --> 37:40.592
And knowing the union issues,
the assassination attempt

37:40.626 --> 37:44.763
was a perfect way
to cover up Hackett's death.

37:47.366 --> 37:50.336
I was gonna be governor.

37:50.369 --> 37:52.938
Do great things for
the people of this state.

37:54.973 --> 37:59.645
The only person
in the state of Louisiana

37:59.678 --> 38:01.513
you can do anything
for now is Dylan.

38:01.547 --> 38:05.551
That kid dies,
your own flesh and blood,

38:05.584 --> 38:08.920
you will never stop thinking
about it, trust me.

38:13.725 --> 38:15.461
Best you just face it head on.

38:20.799 --> 38:23.301
LASALLE: Oh, man,
you're killing me.

38:24.736 --> 38:27.038
ALEC:
So he said yes.

38:27.072 --> 38:29.708
Senator's been taken
to the hospital.

38:29.741 --> 38:32.711
He's, uh, being
tested as we speak.

38:32.744 --> 38:34.045
So Hackett wasn't
Dylan's father.

38:34.079 --> 38:35.981
No.

38:36.014 --> 38:37.649
But he came here
to New Orleans.

38:37.683 --> 38:39.651
He gave his life.

38:39.685 --> 38:41.387
Trying to save Dylan's.

38:43.689 --> 38:45.524
Dylan's kicking
my butt over here.

38:47.559 --> 38:49.895
Um...

38:49.928 --> 38:52.598
Hey, uh...

38:52.631 --> 38:54.099
you ready to go, champ?

38:54.132 --> 38:55.634
Everything okay?

38:59.137 --> 39:00.472
We'll get there,
buddy, yeah.

39:00.506 --> 39:01.840
Come on.

39:13.485 --> 39:16.622
Normally, I'm on the other side
of this table.

39:16.655 --> 39:20.125
You chose to continue our
conversation here, Agent Brody.

39:20.158 --> 39:22.661
This isn't supposed to be
an interrogation.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.830
Yes, it is.

39:24.863 --> 39:27.699
But I'm okay with that.

39:27.733 --> 39:29.935
It's time to put away
the track shoes.

39:32.170 --> 39:35.674
Hooper's eyes...

39:35.707 --> 39:37.375
Why I hesitated...

39:39.177 --> 39:40.846
The shape,

39:40.879 --> 39:42.581
the color,

39:42.614 --> 39:44.115
bright blue,

39:44.149 --> 39:48.654
reminded me of someone
I loved very much,

39:48.687 --> 39:50.856
who I had just lost,
days before.

39:52.090 --> 39:56.462
So I will sit here
as long as you'd like...

39:57.896 --> 39:59.565
...answer all of the questions,

39:59.598 --> 40:01.900
and I will do this in the memory
of the five people

40:01.933 --> 40:03.401
that died on the Moultrie.

40:05.103 --> 40:06.472
Agent Austin Hackett...

40:12.644 --> 40:16.648
...and my twin sister,
Emily Anne Brody...

40:18.650 --> 40:20.619
...who died at the hands
of a drunk driver.

40:26.091 --> 40:28.093
I'm sorry for your loss.

40:30.128 --> 40:31.730
As I am for yours.

40:37.102 --> 40:39.505
Let's start
at the beginning.

40:39.538 --> 40:42.541
The morning of the incident
on the Moultrie.

40:44.543 --> 40:46.778
I woke up at 0600 hours.

40:46.812 --> 40:49.781
We were parked in the Persian
Gulf, waiting on orders,

40:49.815 --> 40:53.485
when the intel came in
about Petty Officer Hooper.

40:53.519 --> 40:56.788
I immediately grabbed my gear
out of the command center.

40:56.822 --> 40:59.090
When I saw hi--

41:01.226 --> 41:02.628
Attagirl.
