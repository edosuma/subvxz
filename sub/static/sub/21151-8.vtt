WEBVTT

00:01.490 --> 00:05.440
On premiere night, I asked
the house guests, who among them

00:05.440 --> 00:08.650
would be tempted by revenge?

00:08.650 --> 00:11.110
Looks like we have a taker.

00:11.110 --> 00:13.990
Welcome to "Big Brother."

00:17.810 --> 00:21.440
ANNOUNCER: Previously
on "Big Brother,"

00:21.440 --> 00:24.590
after horsing around
with Jason, Christmas got

00:24.590 --> 00:26.960
a broken foot in her stocking.

00:26.960 --> 00:30.140
Oh, my god!

00:30.140 --> 00:30.980
Don't touch it.

00:30.980 --> 00:32.300
Don't touch it.

00:32.300 --> 00:36.030
I know my body so well,
something's seriously wrong.

00:36.030 --> 00:39.990
I definitely tore
some ligaments.

00:39.990 --> 00:42.250
ANNOUNCER: With the Head
of Household on the line,

00:42.250 --> 00:44.650
Paul Candy Crushed
the competition.

00:44.650 --> 00:46.020
- Yes!

00:46.020 --> 00:47.650
Yes, baby.
What's up?

00:47.650 --> 00:49.330
Your boy won HOH.

00:49.330 --> 00:51.910
And guess what, that
candy was pretty sweet.

00:51.910 --> 00:54.610
But revenge is going
to be even sweeter.

00:54.610 --> 00:57.700
ANNOUNCER: And he was targeting
public enemy number one.

00:57.700 --> 01:00.250
I've got an A-plus plan to
get Cody out of this house.

01:00.250 --> 01:05.060
ANNOUNCER: So the bearded
rocker recruited two pawns.

01:05.060 --> 01:06.300
There's my boy.

01:06.300 --> 01:07.560
Yes.

01:07.560 --> 01:08.730
I don't know why
all these people

01:08.730 --> 01:10.120
have so much trust in me.

01:10.120 --> 01:11.620
Just kidding.
I know why.

01:11.620 --> 01:14.410
Because Cody screwed over
everybody in this house.

01:14.410 --> 01:16.320
ANNOUNCER: At the
nomination ceremony,

01:16.320 --> 01:18.910
Ramses revealed he was cursed.

01:18.910 --> 01:21.760
The curse forces me to
put myself on the block

01:21.760 --> 01:22.840
as a third nominee.

01:22.840 --> 01:25.900
I'm using this ceremony to
nominate myself for eviction

01:25.900 --> 01:27.750
as a special third nominee.

01:27.750 --> 01:30.100
ANNOUNCER: With the
cos-player joining the pawns,

01:30.100 --> 01:32.770
Paul worried about
his backdoor plan.

01:32.770 --> 01:34.810
The only thing that
could go wrong here

01:34.810 --> 01:38.620
is if Ramses wins the veto,
pulls himself off, I am not

01:38.620 --> 01:40.450
allowed to replace the nominee.

01:40.450 --> 01:42.490
ANNOUNCER: After taking
the ring of replacement

01:42.490 --> 01:44.350
in the den of temptation--

01:44.350 --> 01:46.320
Accept this temptation
and the ring of replacement

01:46.320 --> 01:49.210
will let you play in
any one veto competition

01:49.210 --> 01:50.500
you choose this summer.

01:50.500 --> 01:52.960
I choose to accept
this temptation.

01:52.960 --> 01:54.190
ANNOUNCER: Christmas
put a voodoo

01:54.190 --> 01:58.000
curse on Jason,
Jessica, and Cody,

01:58.000 --> 01:59.470
turning them into V-toads.

02:03.330 --> 02:06.570
Paul asked Ramses to throw
the veto competition.

02:06.570 --> 02:08.910
Either you throw
the veto to somebody

02:08.910 --> 02:11.530
to pull themselves off so I
can replace them with Cody,

02:11.530 --> 02:13.020
or you just sit there.

02:13.020 --> 02:15.300
ANNOUNCER: And after a
battle around the world.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.160
Hope this is right.

02:17.160 --> 02:19.440
ANNOUNCER: Ramses nearly won.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.520
Seven minutes, 44 seconds.

02:21.520 --> 02:22.890
What?

02:22.890 --> 02:24.990
My goal going into
this competition

02:24.990 --> 02:27.620
was to friggin' throw
the competition.

02:27.620 --> 02:29.910
But that apparently
didn't happen.

02:29.910 --> 02:31.680
ANNOUNCER: But it was
the friar of friendship

02:31.680 --> 02:33.380
who was the fastest flyer.

02:33.380 --> 02:35.990
- You are the winner.
- Oh.

02:35.990 --> 02:38.610
Well, guess who has all
the power this week.

02:38.610 --> 02:40.960
And Ramses, you
came in second place

02:40.960 --> 02:42.660
after I told you
to throw the comp.

02:42.660 --> 02:45.360
But coming in second place,
that's definitely not

02:45.360 --> 02:46.240
throwing the comp.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.840
ANNOUNCER: At the veto
meeting, the Miami native

02:48.840 --> 02:50.210
brought the heat.

02:50.210 --> 02:51.940
I don't want to work with you.
I want you out of this house.

02:51.940 --> 02:54.040
And if it wasn't for that golden
apple, I would have been home.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.160
So I hope I see you hop
your ass on out of here.

02:56.160 --> 02:59.070
ANNOUNCER: After the dust
settled, Josh came down.

02:59.070 --> 03:02.640
I've decided to use the
power of veto on Josh.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.310
ANNOUNCER: And it was mission
accomplished for Paul.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.160
I know you wanted to
battle it out with me,

03:07.160 --> 03:08.490
but I'm more of a
checkmate kind of guy.

03:08.490 --> 03:10.830
So Cody, hope on over, bud.

03:10.830 --> 03:13.890
ANNOUNCER: Tonight,
Alex, Ramses, or Cody

03:13.890 --> 03:15.720
will be evicted.

03:15.720 --> 03:19.620
Plus, will Christmas be
forced to leave the game?

03:19.620 --> 03:22.380
It's up to me to decide
whether I leave the game

03:22.380 --> 03:25.060
or have surgery and recover
in the "Big Brother" house.

03:25.060 --> 03:28.630
ANNOUNCER: And the battle
for power begins again.

03:28.630 --> 03:32.480
All this live on "Big Brother."

03:32.480 --> 03:34.400
Who wants meatballs for lunch.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.530
I bet you want them, huh?

04:18.370 --> 04:19.860
Good evening.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.050
I'm Julie Chen.

04:21.050 --> 04:22.750
Welcome to "Big Brother."

04:22.750 --> 04:25.730
It's day 23 inside the
"Big Brother" house.

04:25.730 --> 04:29.420
And after raging for weeks, the
battle between Paul and Cody

04:29.420 --> 04:31.130
has come to a head.

04:31.130 --> 04:35.330
Having waged an unsuccessful
rally to rid the house of Paul,

04:35.330 --> 04:40.490
Cody now finds himself firmly
in his arch-rival's crosshairs.

04:40.490 --> 04:44.120
What nobody knows is
that whomever walks out

04:44.120 --> 04:48.590
the front door tonight will join
the other evicted HouseGuests

04:48.590 --> 04:52.880
next week for a chance to
get back into the game.

04:52.880 --> 04:55.250
I'll tell you more about
the Battle Back Showdown

04:55.250 --> 04:57.780
episode a little later on.

04:57.780 --> 05:02.390
But first, another veto
played, another veto used.

05:02.390 --> 05:04.770
Another veto blows up the house.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.640
Who wants meatballs for lunch.

05:13.640 --> 05:16.180
I'll bet you want them, huh?

05:16.180 --> 05:17.780
Meatballs and linguine
for dinner, buddy.

05:17.780 --> 05:19.070
It's your Last Supper.

05:19.070 --> 05:20.270
Coward.

05:20.270 --> 05:21.230
Hug and kiss that veto.

05:21.230 --> 05:22.850
You're gonna call me a coward?

05:22.850 --> 05:24.180
You don't got better words?

05:24.180 --> 05:27.300
- A man-child, a victim.
- OK.

05:27.300 --> 05:28.320
Gosh, what else.

05:28.320 --> 05:29.210
Fool.

05:29.210 --> 05:29.940
Loser.

05:29.940 --> 05:31.560
You're going to hop
your ass on out of here.

05:31.560 --> 05:32.260
Hi, Julie!

05:32.260 --> 05:33.960
Who's gonna look like
the biggest loser now?

05:33.960 --> 05:35.480
Who's going to look
like the victim?

05:35.480 --> 05:36.440
You fool.

05:36.440 --> 05:37.290
- Let's go outside.
- Mm.

05:37.290 --> 05:38.460
And then you're
going to be like,

05:38.460 --> 05:41.310
hey Christmas, when you rallied,
you did all his dirty work.

05:41.310 --> 05:43.590
Oh, they're gonna kick
you guys off one by one,

05:43.590 --> 05:44.690
and we're trying
to give you guys

05:44.690 --> 05:45.720
a fair game at the .

05:45.720 --> 05:47.660
You were too scared to face
them and compete against them.

05:47.660 --> 05:48.700
And then you still lie on me.

05:48.700 --> 05:49.980
What are you
even talking about?

05:49.980 --> 05:51.290
I'm not going to argue about--

05:51.290 --> 05:53.590
Then shut the-- up if you
don't want to argue, then.

05:53.590 --> 05:54.290
Perfect.

05:54.290 --> 05:54.770
Don't say I don't
want to argue--

05:54.770 --> 05:55.090
I want you to
have a good week--

05:55.090 --> 05:56.090
-- and then sit here
and try to blast me.

05:56.090 --> 05:57.420
--because you're
going home next week.

05:57.420 --> 06:00.650
So literally go change
your diaper and shut up.

06:00.650 --> 06:02.730
You're such a pawn on
either side of the house,

06:02.730 --> 06:04.270
and you don't see it.
- Perfect, perfect.

06:04.270 --> 06:05.440
So you're doing everyone's
dirty work right now.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.080
I'm a floater, but you're
going home next week.

06:07.080 --> 06:08.990
Perfect.
- Baby, I can go home.

06:08.990 --> 06:10.400
I'm not scared, OK?

06:10.400 --> 06:12.890
But you're literally a pawn
on both sides of the house.

06:12.890 --> 06:14.090
And everyone is using you like--

06:14.090 --> 06:15.980
And I'll own that,
but if I go home,

06:15.980 --> 06:17.230
you're going to
go home before me.

06:17.230 --> 06:18.300
OK.
So bring it, then.

06:18.300 --> 06:20.410
- Ditto.
- Then bring it.

06:20.410 --> 06:21.500
You look like a meatball.

06:21.500 --> 06:22.200
You look like a fool.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.700
You're going to hop
your ass on out of here.

06:23.700 --> 06:25.000
Who's gonna look like
the biggest fool?

06:25.000 --> 06:26.540
You, buddy, not me.

06:26.540 --> 06:28.700
Even though I'm on the
block right now, I love it.

06:28.700 --> 06:30.790
This is literally a train
wreck right in front of me,

06:30.790 --> 06:32.450
and I can't take
my eyes off of it.

06:32.450 --> 06:34.290
The more they fight,
the better it is for me.

06:34.290 --> 06:35.630
Who knew the block
could be this fun?

06:39.340 --> 06:40.440
You don't know
how hard it is--

06:40.440 --> 06:41.930
- Relax.
- --to curse this idiot out.

06:41.930 --> 06:42.700
Relax.

06:42.700 --> 06:45.350
Cody's been nothing but
disrespectful towards me

06:45.350 --> 06:46.280
since day one.

06:46.280 --> 06:49.640
Saying derogatory terms, running
around with his smut face.

06:49.640 --> 06:52.550
This toad went from a power
trip straight to the block.

06:52.550 --> 06:53.790
And guess what, Cody.

06:53.790 --> 06:57.700
Meatball, you're
going home this week.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.800
I put myself on the
block as a third nominee.

06:59.800 --> 07:02.770
But I'm kind of at ease
that Cody's next to me,

07:02.770 --> 07:04.090
because I think he's
a bigger target.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.890
And I'm positive he's
going to go home.

07:11.690 --> 07:13.190
There's never a dull
moment in the house.

07:13.190 --> 07:14.290
You have some
pretty good digs.

07:18.080 --> 07:20.480
Thanks for keeping
your cool, buddy.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.230
- Yeah.
- Respect.

07:22.230 --> 07:24.720
Thanks.
- Yeah, same.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.580
It seems like Paul is
the only other alpha

07:26.580 --> 07:29.320
in this house that's
willing to make big moves.

07:29.320 --> 07:31.470
I took the first shot.

07:31.470 --> 07:33.460
He took a shot back at me.

07:33.460 --> 07:34.900
I don't blame him at all.

07:34.900 --> 07:36.830
He's a competitor, and
he needed to take me out.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.160
Hello!

07:49.160 --> 07:50.140
Yay!

07:50.140 --> 07:53.590
Christmas!

07:53.590 --> 07:55.520
Um, can we get
everybody in the--

07:55.520 --> 07:56.830
everybody in the living room?

07:56.830 --> 07:57.530
Yeah.

07:57.530 --> 08:00.680
It's been a real hard
week, and I have to have

08:00.680 --> 08:03.510
a major surgery on my foot.

08:03.510 --> 08:05.390
Everyone in the living room.

08:05.390 --> 08:06.320
Christmas has got news.

08:10.080 --> 08:12.770
And now I have to make a
big decision on whether or not

08:12.770 --> 08:16.500
I stay or go home.

08:16.500 --> 08:19.760
HouseGuests, as everyone
knows, I broke my foot.

08:19.760 --> 08:22.370
I now have officially been
told that I will need surgery.

08:27.740 --> 08:30.890
My surgery is scheduled
for Wednesday.

08:30.890 --> 08:33.650
It's up to me to decide
whether I leave the game

08:33.650 --> 08:37.010
or have surgery and recover
in the "Big Brother" house.

08:37.010 --> 08:40.430
Should I choose to
continue in the game,

08:40.430 --> 08:44.300
"Big Brother" will not be
altering any competitions.

08:44.300 --> 08:46.430
That means there will
be some competitions

08:46.430 --> 08:48.800
that I can compete
and some competitions

08:48.800 --> 08:51.540
I cannot compete in.

08:51.540 --> 08:59.580
Knowing all of
this, my decision is

08:59.580 --> 09:02.510
to continue to be the
queen of perseverance

09:02.510 --> 09:05.000
and stay in the
"Big Brother" house.

09:14.970 --> 09:18.470
Christmas is touting
her own perseverance.

09:18.470 --> 09:20.630
Just that's not
perseverance to me.

09:20.630 --> 09:25.180
I'm not feeling
sympathetic for her.

09:25.180 --> 09:28.480
I just want to thank all
of you guys for your support

09:28.480 --> 09:32.380
and your belief in my
capability and that you

09:32.380 --> 09:33.970
have continued to
be compassionate

09:33.970 --> 09:35.920
and understanding.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.010
I'm so glad that
you're staying with us.

09:38.010 --> 09:38.770
Thanks.

09:38.770 --> 09:40.740
I am too.

09:40.740 --> 09:44.680
- Very, very blessed.
- Pfft.

09:50.410 --> 09:55.410
Cody's actions are distasteful
and plain out inconsiderate.

09:55.410 --> 09:57.400
Cody, when I first
met you, I thought

09:57.400 --> 09:59.680
you were a respectable man.

09:59.680 --> 10:00.580
I mean, you're a marine.

10:00.580 --> 10:01.960
It's one team, one fight.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.970
Fast forward to now,
and I'm completely

10:03.970 --> 10:05.440
blown away about you.

10:05.440 --> 10:07.340
I guess I was wrong.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.810
You made me cry!

10:14.700 --> 10:15.750
Thanks for sticking around.

10:15.750 --> 10:17.650
I wanted to chat.

10:17.650 --> 10:19.450
Yeah.

10:19.450 --> 10:22.020
Cody's not going to beg
for his life in this game,

10:22.020 --> 10:24.150
but my game is not over.

10:24.150 --> 10:27.180
So I need to try and mend
fences with Christmas

10:27.180 --> 10:30.390
and show her that I'm
not the enemy here.

10:36.990 --> 10:39.780
You might believe that
I had something to do

10:39.780 --> 10:42.940
or had any knowledge of you
being nominated, and I did not.

10:42.940 --> 10:44.040
And that is the truth.

10:44.040 --> 10:49.080
Game-wise, I saw that you were
going to take me and Cody out.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.180
So, did I campaign against you?

10:51.180 --> 10:53.260
Yes.

10:53.260 --> 10:56.390
Does that mean that I disliked
who you were as a person?

10:56.390 --> 10:57.090
No.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.430
I don't really know
where things changed

10:59.430 --> 11:02.010
personally between
you and I, and you've

11:02.010 --> 11:03.960
made my life here harder.

11:03.960 --> 11:07.270
And I think that you're a
better person than playing

11:07.270 --> 11:08.160
the mean girl role.

11:11.900 --> 11:12.600
OK.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.170
So, where do you want to start?

11:14.170 --> 11:16.090
I'll start from the beginning.
- Yeah.

11:16.090 --> 11:17.720
Yeah, I wanted to hear
you through before I

11:17.720 --> 11:20.550
responded to anything.

11:20.550 --> 11:21.680
I honestly believe
that you didn't

11:21.680 --> 11:26.180
have any influence on what was
going on with Cody's decision.

11:26.180 --> 11:30.080
So, what turned for me is that
I felt personally attacked.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.280
I'm not trying to play
this game in a dirty way.

11:32.280 --> 11:33.060
I really am not.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.190
I gave you an opportunity.

11:34.190 --> 11:35.400
Give me an opportunity
to respond.

11:35.400 --> 11:36.090
OK.

11:36.090 --> 11:38.570
I'm not trying to argue with
you or be hostile with you.

11:38.570 --> 11:39.520
I'm sorry I interrupted.

11:39.520 --> 11:41.150
Please continue.

11:41.150 --> 11:42.290
I broke my foot.

11:42.290 --> 11:44.890
And then when I came back,
you and Cody didn't come back

11:44.890 --> 11:46.800
from downstairs to check on me.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.500
Who was the first person
that saw you, Christmas?

11:48.500 --> 11:49.910
Do you want me to
finish, or do you just

11:49.910 --> 11:52.150
want to keep on interrupting?

11:52.150 --> 11:53.090
Christmas--

11:53.090 --> 11:54.770
I took that as
a personal attack.

11:54.770 --> 11:57.470
I'm not trying to
be catty towards you.

11:57.470 --> 12:00.000
I am not trying to
be vindictive to you.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.140
I'm literally just trying to
live in the same house as you.

12:02.140 --> 12:02.840
OK.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.410
Well, then, let's just
live in the same house.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.920
Oh, man, Jessica.

12:11.920 --> 12:14.440
Your timing is really peculiar.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.540
She has her back pressed
up against the wall.

12:16.540 --> 12:18.340
She's put herself
in this position.

12:18.340 --> 12:19.930
And now she's doing
whatever she can

12:19.930 --> 12:21.490
to pivot out of that position.

12:21.490 --> 12:22.270
I get it.

12:22.270 --> 12:23.230
I hear you.

12:23.230 --> 12:24.730
But I don't know.

12:24.730 --> 12:27.010
Maybe you shouldn't
call me a mean girl when

12:27.010 --> 12:28.700
you're trying to apologize.

12:28.700 --> 12:32.470
You have some time to
mend some relationships.

12:32.470 --> 12:36.490
And I promise to try to
get past what happened.

12:36.490 --> 12:40.000
But I can't guarantee.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.970
So--

12:47.430 --> 12:49.710
For the record,
Christmas underwent

12:49.710 --> 12:52.130
successful surgery yesterday.

12:52.130 --> 12:54.240
And while she will
return to the game,

12:54.240 --> 12:56.820
she has not been
medically cleared to leave

12:56.820 --> 12:58.700
the hospital yet.

12:58.700 --> 13:02.250
However she will join us
live from her hospital room

13:02.250 --> 13:06.030
to cast her vote to
evict later in the show.

13:06.030 --> 13:10.470
Up next, Cody may feel
like a dead frog walking.

13:10.470 --> 13:13.730
But is there time to
save his girl's game?

13:13.730 --> 13:15.650
Then, it's the live
vote and eviction.

13:15.650 --> 13:18.450
Either Alex,
Ramses, or Cody will

13:18.450 --> 13:19.680
leave the "Big Brother" house.

13:19.680 --> 13:23.280
But whoever is sent
packing will immediately

13:23.280 --> 13:28.290
learn that they will get a
shot to re-enter the game.

13:28.290 --> 13:30.680
Stay with us.

13:49.070 --> 13:51.260
Welcome back to "Big Brother."

13:51.260 --> 13:54.680
He's up on the block and
possibly headed out the door.

13:54.680 --> 13:58.360
But Cody is determined to
stir things up before he goes.

14:02.850 --> 14:05.430
Oh my god.
Oh my god, I'll help you.

14:05.430 --> 14:06.380
I got it.

14:06.380 --> 14:07.320
I got the door.

14:07.320 --> 14:09.370
Today is Dominique's birthday.

14:09.370 --> 14:11.740
I am super-duper excited.

14:11.740 --> 14:14.020
I made her the best
gluten free cake.

14:14.020 --> 14:17.190
We don't have gifts, but we have
each other, and that's enough.

14:22.130 --> 14:24.630
One, two, three.

14:24.630 --> 14:27.630
ALL: Happy birthday!

14:38.220 --> 14:38.920
Look at this.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.870
Peanut butter, chocolate,
gluten free icing.

14:41.870 --> 14:43.600
That look amazing!

14:43.600 --> 14:44.320
Thank you.

14:44.320 --> 14:45.810
And I'm going to get
some ice cream just

14:45.810 --> 14:48.850
to step this next level up.

14:48.850 --> 14:54.470
I have had every punishment
in the house poured onto me.

14:54.470 --> 14:57.130
I'm on slot, and I
can't even do something

14:57.130 --> 14:59.630
as simple as eat a cake.

14:59.630 --> 15:03.250
And where I can go in the house
is limited, because we have

15:03.250 --> 15:06.850
to sit on lily pads all week.

15:06.850 --> 15:10.210
It's basically like
every single comfort

15:10.210 --> 15:11.970
has just been stripped from me.

15:29.190 --> 15:33.850
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

15:43.280 --> 15:44.810
I'm looking at Jess.

15:44.810 --> 15:47.060
I feel really bad for
her, everything that she's

15:47.060 --> 15:48.260
had to go through in this game.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.100
I'm hoping she can
pull it together.

15:54.100 --> 15:56.760
Because at this point, all we
can do is salvage her game.

15:56.760 --> 16:00.880
I'm disappointed in
myself, because you

16:00.880 --> 16:06.580
have faced all the collateral
damage from my risks.

16:06.580 --> 16:08.170
I didn't take you
into consideration

16:08.170 --> 16:11.830
at all where I took those
risks, and it was selfish of me.

16:11.830 --> 16:13.630
And I do regret it.

16:13.630 --> 16:15.410
It's just getting
harder and harder.

16:19.510 --> 16:21.320
I never thought it
would be this hard.

16:40.740 --> 16:42.500
I feel like I'm
going home this week.

16:42.500 --> 16:45.390
I'm feeling pretty bad about
the position I put Jessica in.

16:45.390 --> 16:46.620
I mean, she's down in the dumps.

16:46.620 --> 16:47.340
She's crying.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.800
The least I can do for Jess
is set her up for success

16:49.800 --> 16:50.970
for the rest of the game.

16:50.970 --> 16:53.220
Good starting point for
that, dropping some names,

16:53.220 --> 16:55.800
dropping some bombs, stirring
the pot a little bit.

16:55.800 --> 16:58.170
I'm just a little
confused on why

16:58.170 --> 17:01.410
there is so much
direct animosity

17:01.410 --> 17:04.400
and disdain for me from you.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.540
You want to know
what caused it?

17:05.540 --> 17:06.490
Yeah, I'd like to.

17:06.490 --> 17:08.560
You're not gonna believe me.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.190
Well, let's try.

17:10.190 --> 17:11.080
It wasn't blind.

17:11.080 --> 17:15.060
I didn't go into this
decision by myself.

17:15.060 --> 17:17.790
So, what caused
you putting me out?

17:17.790 --> 17:21.340
Two people came to me.

17:21.340 --> 17:22.800
--said put you up.

17:27.190 --> 17:29.700
Jess wasn't involved.

17:29.700 --> 17:32.550
Then afterwards,
when I put you up,

17:32.550 --> 17:34.710
Dominique then came
up to me and she goes,

17:34.710 --> 17:36.900
I promise I'm going to
keep Christmas here.

17:36.900 --> 17:39.600
So I'm like, so,
you just play me

17:39.600 --> 17:41.120
just to get me to put her up?

17:41.120 --> 17:43.020
And I'm blown away.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.970
I thought you were
putting up because I had

17:44.970 --> 17:48.310
a good relationship with Paul.

17:48.310 --> 17:49.350
That is another reason.

17:49.350 --> 17:50.550
Yeah, absolutely.

17:50.550 --> 17:52.820
Even Paul-- like Act One Paul--

17:52.820 --> 17:56.230
Mark knew about
that from the start.

17:56.230 --> 17:58.950
- You let him know your agenda.
- Right, right.

18:08.120 --> 18:11.560
If there is some way that you
guys can get on the same page--

18:11.560 --> 18:13.230
you don't even have to be
friends with each other.

18:13.230 --> 18:15.450
Just, like, get
on the same page.

18:15.450 --> 18:17.480
So, I'm not sure why
you're telling me everything,

18:17.480 --> 18:19.290
but I appreciate it.

18:19.290 --> 18:19.990
Because I--

18:19.990 --> 18:21.130
I mean, I'm out the door.

18:21.130 --> 18:22.390
Like, there is nothing I can do.

18:22.390 --> 18:24.820
I might as well shake things up.

18:24.820 --> 18:26.740
I'm not saying that
I believe him 100%,

18:26.740 --> 18:29.830
but Dominique and Mark
are definitely red flags.

18:29.830 --> 18:32.110
Mark has continued to
keep his distance from me,

18:32.110 --> 18:34.090
and Dominique is
just always keeping

18:34.090 --> 18:35.290
her distance from everybody.

18:35.290 --> 18:37.390
And so I have to
tread with caution.

18:45.700 --> 18:46.400
Yeah.

18:53.530 --> 18:54.230
So, here we are.

18:54.230 --> 18:56.040
We're ready for the
Wednesday night show.

18:56.040 --> 18:58.130
We have three
HouseGuests on tonight.

18:58.130 --> 18:59.200
We're ready to have a good time.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.240
And now let me introduce
Dominique the Dominator.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.310
Let's hear it from the audience.

19:05.010 --> 19:08.420
Thank you, thank you.

19:08.420 --> 19:10.820
I host this talk
show every week.

19:10.820 --> 19:13.190
Kevin is my very
dapper announcer.

19:13.190 --> 19:15.260
This week, we're
interviewing the nominees.

19:15.260 --> 19:17.540
The first HouseGuest,
lovely young lady.

19:17.540 --> 19:19.270
Let's give her a big
round of applause.

19:19.270 --> 19:22.570
Alex from LA.

19:22.570 --> 19:25.520
Welcome.

19:25.520 --> 19:27.130
Have a seat.

19:27.130 --> 19:28.580
So, hello, Alex.

19:28.580 --> 19:29.560
Hello.

19:29.560 --> 19:32.180
Tell us who you are, where
you're from, and a fun fact.

19:32.180 --> 19:34.660
A fun fact about me is that
I crochet, knit, play games.

19:34.660 --> 19:36.280
We'll get into that.

19:36.280 --> 19:40.140
I lived most of my childhood
in the Dominican Republic.

19:40.140 --> 19:42.550
- Wow.
- So hello, Cody.

19:42.550 --> 19:43.320
Hey, what's going on?

19:43.320 --> 19:44.570
Thanks for joining us.

19:44.570 --> 19:46.840
Have a seat.
All right.

19:46.840 --> 19:48.470
So, let's talk about day one.

19:48.470 --> 19:50.590
So what's going on in your head?

19:50.590 --> 19:52.410
Any not-so-great
impressions that--

19:52.410 --> 19:53.110
Paul.

19:53.110 --> 19:54.430
I didn't like Paul
right off the bat.

19:54.430 --> 19:55.840
Why?

19:55.840 --> 19:57.790
I thought he was
loud and brash, and I

19:57.790 --> 19:59.730
just found it over-the-top.

19:59.730 --> 20:00.520
Wow.

20:00.520 --> 20:01.880
Here I am, bud.

20:01.880 --> 20:04.390
Here I am.

20:04.390 --> 20:07.250
Do we have any questions
before I continue?

20:07.250 --> 20:09.270
If you weren't intimidated
as a man or a player,

20:09.270 --> 20:11.110
do you think you would have
lasted longer in this game?

20:11.110 --> 20:13.340
Is that supposed to
be a dig at me, Josh?

20:13.340 --> 20:15.280
No, it's a serious question.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.460
Josh, you don't
exist in my book.

20:17.460 --> 20:18.660
I'm not going to
give you any more--

20:18.660 --> 20:20.350
I'm a guest asking a question.

20:20.350 --> 20:21.920
I'm not taking any
questions from Josh.

20:21.920 --> 20:23.770
- OK.
- OK, we can respect that.

20:23.770 --> 20:24.470
.

20:24.470 --> 20:26.710
I was just asking
him a question.

20:26.710 --> 20:29.380
Moving into HOH,
it's no secret there

20:29.380 --> 20:33.580
were organically forming teams.

20:37.720 --> 20:40.040
And you were the leader.

20:40.040 --> 20:40.900
Uh, no.

20:40.900 --> 20:42.430
I just wanted to beat Paul.

20:42.430 --> 20:43.230
Oh, wow.

20:43.230 --> 20:44.050
Yeah.

20:44.050 --> 20:47.920
So was this like an internal
inclination, or you had--

20:47.920 --> 20:50.560
First week, I was going
to try and take Paul out.

20:50.560 --> 20:53.260
And then that we're just going
to compete from that point on.

20:57.260 --> 20:58.260
What's up?

20:58.260 --> 21:02.090
So, was it a decision that
was solely based on your own?

21:02.090 --> 21:04.730
There was at least one or
two people always involved.

21:10.000 --> 21:10.750
Meaning what?

21:10.750 --> 21:13.510
Like you told them, or just
one or two people involved?

21:13.510 --> 21:15.400
One or two people always
knew about the decision

21:15.400 --> 21:18.420
I was going to make.

21:18.420 --> 21:19.610
Which decision is that?

21:19.610 --> 21:20.960
All I'm saying.

21:20.960 --> 21:21.740
That's all I'm saying.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.170
Well, I'm asking,
which decision is that?

21:23.170 --> 21:24.430
That's all I'm saying.

21:24.430 --> 21:25.390
For what?

21:25.390 --> 21:26.330
That's all I'm saying.

21:26.330 --> 21:28.030
One or two people
knew which decision?

21:28.030 --> 21:31.690
That's all I'm saying, Mark.

21:31.690 --> 21:35.730
So, the one or two people
that knew about every decision

21:35.730 --> 21:39.210
that you made, that
statement right there,

21:39.210 --> 21:42.760
is going to help Jess's
game moving forward.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.380
Are you implying
that me just putting

21:45.380 --> 21:46.580
out a general
statement, that you're

21:46.580 --> 21:47.700
going to go after Jess now?

21:47.700 --> 21:48.970
I'm just making a statement.

21:48.970 --> 21:50.310
I get where you're
going with it,

21:50.310 --> 21:52.060
because I'm not a dumb-dumb,
when you're trying--

21:52.060 --> 21:53.760
Neither am I when you
say one or two people know.

21:53.760 --> 21:55.320
All right.
Very well.

22:02.900 --> 22:04.050
Just relax.

22:04.050 --> 22:04.980
Yeah, chill, buddy.

22:04.980 --> 22:06.240
Relax.

22:06.240 --> 22:08.190
Again, I take things
personally because--

22:08.190 --> 22:08.960
I know you do.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.940
--for whatever reason, I
think he'd be a man of his word

22:10.940 --> 22:14.100
and actually go out like a man.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.770
About what he's done
in the last two weeks

22:15.770 --> 22:16.880
would make you think that?

22:16.880 --> 22:18.520
You know Cody
was blowing smoke

22:18.520 --> 22:20.860
when he said that, about one
or two people always knowing.

22:20.860 --> 22:23.170
Dude, he's dropping
bombs before he leaves.

22:23.170 --> 22:23.870
OK.

22:23.870 --> 22:26.930
I'm sure he wanted people
to assume that you are one.

22:26.930 --> 22:32.430
But this does not
change anything.

22:32.430 --> 22:33.420
Absolutely not.

22:33.420 --> 22:36.390
So now, what
I'm more concerned

22:36.390 --> 22:40.890
about is Dom referring to
us as an organic group.

22:40.890 --> 22:43.210
Why would you even go down
that line of questioning?

22:43.210 --> 22:44.880
I have no idea what
that was all about.

22:44.880 --> 22:45.930
Of course you don't know.

22:45.930 --> 22:46.770
None of us know.

22:46.770 --> 22:49.710
After this spew, I'm safe.

22:49.710 --> 22:51.820
Y'all are not.

22:51.820 --> 22:53.720
And whatever she
just dropped may not

22:53.720 --> 22:55.850
have affected our heads,
but it's not our heads

22:55.850 --> 22:56.890
we need to worry about.

22:56.890 --> 22:58.660
It's the other people who
could potentially want HOH.

23:01.550 --> 23:02.960
Dominique's line
of questioning

23:02.960 --> 23:05.540
was absolutely the stupidest
thing I've ever seen.

23:05.540 --> 23:07.880
There are obvious cracks
going on in this group,

23:07.880 --> 23:11.300
and I want to make sure that I
maybe crack them a little more

23:11.300 --> 23:15.290
so that I can set myself up
for when I am no longer safe.

23:15.290 --> 23:19.420
That was not OK.

23:19.420 --> 23:22.340
Look, Dominique, if you
keep going down this path,

23:22.340 --> 23:24.020
you might just be
on the opposite end

23:24.020 --> 23:25.630
of a hosting show--

23:25.630 --> 23:28.070
AKA, the exit interview
with Julie Chen.

23:32.380 --> 23:35.470
Up next, it's the
live vote and eviction.

23:35.470 --> 23:37.810
Alex, Ramses, or Cody.

23:37.810 --> 23:39.130
Two will be safe.

23:39.130 --> 23:41.830
One will be evicted.

23:41.830 --> 23:44.440
Then an epic battle
of endurance begins.

23:44.440 --> 23:46.210
Who will become
Head Of Household

23:46.210 --> 23:48.640
at this crucial
point in the game?

23:48.640 --> 23:50.530
Stay with us.

24:12.710 --> 24:14.260
Welcome back to "Big Brother."

24:14.260 --> 24:16.750
It's now time for the
live vote and eviction.

24:16.750 --> 24:18.850
Alex, Ramses, or Cody.

24:18.850 --> 24:20.260
Who will be sent packing?

24:20.260 --> 24:21.400
It's time to find out.

24:21.400 --> 24:24.670
Let's head to the living room
and talk with the nominees.

24:24.670 --> 24:25.740
Hello, HouseGuests.

24:27.780 --> 24:29.850
Before we begin
tonight's live vote,

24:29.850 --> 24:33.390
I wanted to let you know that
Christmas had her surgery

24:33.390 --> 24:34.530
yesterday.

24:34.530 --> 24:37.570
All went well.

24:37.570 --> 24:42.060
But she has not been
cleared medically

24:42.060 --> 24:44.740
to leave the hospital yet.

24:44.740 --> 24:47.160
However she will be
casting her eviction

24:47.160 --> 24:50.820
vote live remotely tonight.

24:50.820 --> 24:53.730
With that, it's now time for
the live vote and eviction.

24:53.730 --> 24:57.240
Alex, Ramses, Cody, in just
moments your housemates will

24:57.240 --> 24:59.550
cast their votes to evict live.

24:59.550 --> 25:01.290
But before they
do, you each have

25:01.290 --> 25:05.790
a final chance to sway their
votes with one brief statement.

25:05.790 --> 25:09.130
Alex, you're first.

25:09.130 --> 25:09.860
Hello, everyone.

25:09.860 --> 25:11.710
My name is Alex, for those
of you who don't know me.

25:11.710 --> 25:13.100
Actually, you all
know me hopefully,

25:13.100 --> 25:14.890
and know me well enough
to keep me in this house.

25:14.890 --> 25:15.990
This has been one
of the greatest

25:15.990 --> 25:18.650
experiences of my life, and
I'm so excited to be here.

25:18.650 --> 25:20.080
I trust that all of
you know me well enough

25:20.080 --> 25:22.180
and have seen me compete to
know that I deserve to be here

25:22.180 --> 25:23.350
and fight for a place.

25:23.350 --> 25:25.240
Please do not cast your
votes to evict me tonight,

25:25.240 --> 25:27.870
because I plan to stay and
compete against all of you

25:27.870 --> 25:29.050
in a good competitive nature.

25:29.050 --> 25:30.160
Thank you.

25:30.160 --> 25:31.380
JULIE CHEN: Thank you, Alex.

25:31.380 --> 25:33.160
Ramses?

25:33.160 --> 25:34.620
OK.

25:34.620 --> 25:38.140
Guys, I was put in this position
by myself, which really sucks.

25:38.140 --> 25:40.660
So I'm hoping you guys
don't vote to evict me.

25:40.660 --> 25:43.210
I'm loving the time I've
got to spend with you guys,

25:43.210 --> 25:46.570
and I really, really, really
want more time with you guys.

25:46.570 --> 25:49.060
So yeah, please don't
take me out on the day

25:49.060 --> 25:50.470
that I put myself
up on the block,

25:50.470 --> 25:52.500
because that would
suck severely.

25:52.500 --> 25:53.200
Thank you.

25:53.200 --> 25:54.850
JULIE CHEN: Thank you, Ramses.

25:54.850 --> 25:56.130
Cody?

25:56.130 --> 25:58.850
Paisley, love and
miss you, kiddo.

25:58.850 --> 26:00.200
Don't be a beta.

26:00.200 --> 26:03.110
Jessica, thanks for standing
side by side with me.

26:03.110 --> 26:05.100
I'm extremely humbled.

26:05.100 --> 26:05.990
I'm going to be bummed.

26:05.990 --> 26:09.220
I'm going to miss you a lot.

26:09.220 --> 26:10.150
JULIE CHEN: Thank you, Cody.

26:10.150 --> 26:10.930
Thank you all.

26:10.930 --> 26:14.120
All right, it's now time for
the live voting to begin.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.550
The three nominees are
not allowed to vote.

26:16.550 --> 26:18.700
Paul, as current
head of household,

26:18.700 --> 26:21.070
you will only vote in
the event of a tie.

26:22.030 --> 26:24.730
One at a time, the rest of
you will enter the Diary Room

26:24.730 --> 26:27.820
and cast your vote to evict.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.410
Jessica, you're up first.

26:29.410 --> 26:30.630
Please go to the Diary Room.

26:40.030 --> 26:43.990
Jessica is in a very
public showmance with Cody.

26:43.990 --> 26:48.280
So which of the other two
will she vote to evict?

26:48.280 --> 26:49.270
Hi, Jessica.

26:49.270 --> 26:50.230
Hi, gorgeous.

26:50.230 --> 26:51.850
Please cast your
vote to evict.

26:51.850 --> 26:53.790
I vote to evict Ramses.

26:53.790 --> 26:54.520
JULIE CHEN: Thank you.

26:54.520 --> 26:55.220
Thank you.

26:58.990 --> 27:02.050
Kevin cast a mystery
vote last week.

27:02.050 --> 27:05.910
Will he do the same tonight?
Hi, Kevin.

27:05.910 --> 27:07.330
Hey, Julie.
How are you doing tonight?

27:07.330 --> 27:08.140
I'm well, thank you.

27:08.140 --> 27:10.250
Please cast your vote to evict.

27:10.250 --> 27:12.280
I cast to evict Ramses.

27:12.280 --> 27:13.800
Happy birthday, Mom.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.100
JULIE CHEN: Thank you.
- Thank you, Julie.

27:15.100 --> 27:15.800
Have a good night.

27:20.030 --> 27:22.910
Let's now join Christmas
live on the phone

27:22.910 --> 27:25.640
from her hospital room.

27:25.640 --> 27:27.010
Christmas, hello.

27:27.010 --> 27:28.410
CHRISTMAS : Hi, Julie.

27:28.410 --> 27:29.760
How are you feeling?

27:29.760 --> 27:30.860
CHRISTMAS (ON
PHONE): I'm feeling

27:30.860 --> 27:33.430
better, as minutes go on.

27:33.430 --> 27:34.370
JULIE CHEN: All right.

27:34.370 --> 27:37.160
Well, you know we're in the
middle of the live vote.

27:37.160 --> 27:40.680
So I do need to ask you to
please cast your vote to evict.

27:40.680 --> 27:41.780
CHRISTMAS (ON
PHONE): Yes, ma'am.

27:41.780 --> 27:43.670
I cast my vote--

27:43.670 --> 27:46.670
I vote to evict Ramses.

27:46.670 --> 27:47.660
JULIE CHEN: Thank you.

27:47.660 --> 27:50.750
CHRISTMAS : Thank you.

27:50.750 --> 27:54.320
The vote is zero
votes to evict Alex,

27:54.320 --> 27:58.850
three votes to evict Ramses,
and no votes to evict Cody.

27:58.850 --> 28:02.570
The rest of the votes plus the
live eviction when we return.

28:02.570 --> 28:04.430
Stay with us.

28:28.140 --> 28:30.090
Welcome back to "Big Brother."

28:30.090 --> 28:32.710
The HouseGuests are currently
voting live to evict

28:32.710 --> 28:35.110
either Alex, Ramses, or Cody.

28:35.110 --> 28:38.320
So far it's zero
votes to evict Alex,

28:38.320 --> 28:42.700
three votes to evict Ramses,
and no votes to evict Cody.

28:42.700 --> 28:44.920
Let's continue
with the live vote.

28:44.920 --> 28:49.030
Raven joined her allies last
week and abandoned Cody.

28:49.030 --> 28:52.770
Her vote should
be an obvious one.

28:52.770 --> 28:53.470
Hi, Raven.

28:53.470 --> 28:54.940
Hey, hey, Julie.

28:54.940 --> 28:56.560
Please cast your
vote to evict.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.550
I vote to evict Cody.

28:58.550 --> 28:59.980
JULIE CHEN: Thank you.
- Thank you.

29:02.940 --> 29:06.180
Dominique's talk show helped
Cody shake up the house.

29:06.180 --> 29:10.320
But did it shake up her vote?

29:10.320 --> 29:11.130
Hi, Dominique.

29:11.130 --> 29:12.300
Hi, Julie.

29:12.300 --> 29:13.800
Please cast your
vote to evict.

29:13.800 --> 29:16.430
I vote to evict Cody.

29:16.430 --> 29:17.860
JULIE CHEN: Thank you.
- Thank you.

29:20.530 --> 29:23.410
Cody publicly
blew up Mark's game.

29:23.410 --> 29:25.330
Will Mark return
the favor tonight?

29:28.190 --> 29:29.560
Hello, Mark.
- Hey, Julie.

29:29.560 --> 29:30.970
Please cast your
vote to evict.

29:30.970 --> 29:32.560
I vote to evict Cody.

29:32.560 --> 29:33.990
JULIE CHEN: Thank you.
- Yep.

29:36.360 --> 29:39.720
Jason shared a lily
pad with Cody this week.

29:39.720 --> 29:44.320
Does he have any allegiance
for his fellow frog?

29:44.320 --> 29:45.020
Hi, Jason.

29:45.020 --> 29:45.870
Hi, Julie.

29:45.870 --> 29:47.400
Please cast your
vote to evict.

29:47.400 --> 29:49.050
I wish it worked
out better for you,

29:49.050 --> 29:51.210
but I vote to evict Cody.

29:51.210 --> 29:51.940
JULIE CHEN: Thank you.

29:51.940 --> 29:52.640
Thank you.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.140
Josh has made no secret
of how he feels about Cody.

29:58.140 --> 30:02.180
His vote should not
be a secret either.

30:02.180 --> 30:02.880
Hi, Josh.

30:02.880 --> 30:03.780
What's up, Julie?

30:03.780 --> 30:05.070
Please cast your
vote to evict.

30:05.070 --> 30:07.350
I vote to evict Cody.

30:07.350 --> 30:08.120
JULIE CHEN: Thank you.

30:08.120 --> 30:10.620
Thank you.

30:10.620 --> 30:15.660
Elena felt blindsided by
Cody's actions last week.

30:15.660 --> 30:19.620
Was it enough for her
to want him evicted?

30:19.620 --> 30:20.760
Hi, Elena.

30:20.760 --> 30:21.720
Hi, Julie.

30:21.720 --> 30:23.350
Please cast your vote to evict.

30:23.350 --> 30:25.650
I vote to evict Cody.

30:25.650 --> 30:27.190
JULIE CHEN: Thank you.
- Thanks.

30:30.080 --> 30:30.830
It's official.

30:30.830 --> 30:32.930
With six votes to
evict Cody, Cody

30:32.930 --> 30:34.460
will leave the house tonight.

30:34.460 --> 30:38.790
But let's see how Matt votes.

30:38.790 --> 30:39.500
Hi, Matt.

30:39.500 --> 30:40.250
What's up, Julie?

30:40.250 --> 30:41.690
Please cast your
vote to evict.

30:41.690 --> 30:43.580
I vote to evict Cody.

30:43.580 --> 30:44.310
JULIE CHEN: Thank you.

30:44.310 --> 30:45.290
Thanks, Julie.

30:57.530 --> 30:59.330
All of the votes are in.

30:59.330 --> 31:02.270
Let's give the news
to the HouseGuests.

31:02.270 --> 31:04.760
HouseGuests, the votes are in.

31:04.760 --> 31:07.310
When I reveal the vote,
the evicted HouseGuests

31:07.310 --> 31:09.320
will have just a
few moments to say

31:09.320 --> 31:12.140
goodbye, gather his
or her belongings,

31:12.140 --> 31:14.940
and walk out the front door.

31:14.940 --> 31:19.950
With zero votes to evict,
Alex, you're safe, which means

31:19.950 --> 31:23.020
it's between Ramsey's and Cody.

31:23.020 --> 31:28.210
By a vote of seven to three,
Cody, you have been evicted

31:28.210 --> 31:29.230
from the "Big Brother" house.

31:52.100 --> 31:55.150
.

31:55.150 --> 31:56.550
I'm taking her away.

31:58.990 --> 32:01.440
Hey, will you be my girlfriend?

32:10.240 --> 32:11.710
Have a seat.

32:15.620 --> 32:18.320
--what that was.

32:18.320 --> 32:19.950
That was very interesting.

32:19.950 --> 32:21.460
It was pretty interesting.

32:32.830 --> 32:33.810
It's so weird.

32:33.810 --> 32:34.800
It is weird.

32:39.120 --> 32:40.250
Of course he
didn't say goodbye.

32:43.660 --> 32:45.120
I'm sorry for you.

32:45.120 --> 32:48.530
- Thank you.
- It's OK.

32:52.910 --> 32:53.740
girl?

33:01.460 --> 33:02.370
Yeah.

33:02.370 --> 33:04.330
Well, that's one.

33:04.330 --> 33:06.170
Hm?

33:06.170 --> 33:08.900
Well, let's just start with
what you whispered to Jessica.

33:08.900 --> 33:10.100
You asked her to
be your girlfriend.

33:10.100 --> 33:11.380
Is this--

33:11.380 --> 33:12.950
Yeah.
Oh, please.

33:12.950 --> 33:15.840
We have microphones everywhere.

33:15.840 --> 33:18.800
So, this is a real
relationship, one that you hope

33:18.800 --> 33:20.430
to pursue outside the house.

33:20.430 --> 33:21.320
Absolutely.

33:21.320 --> 33:22.730
Well, at least there's that.

33:22.730 --> 33:23.460
Yeah.

33:23.460 --> 33:25.330
From your short
time in the house.

33:25.330 --> 33:27.800
- Right.
- Let's talk about the game.

33:27.800 --> 33:31.100
It seemed like just a short
time ago you appeared to be set.

33:31.100 --> 33:32.180
You had an alliance of nine.

33:32.180 --> 33:33.260
You were running that house.

33:33.260 --> 33:35.530
It looked like for weeks
you were going to be safe.

33:35.530 --> 33:36.230
Right.

33:36.230 --> 33:39.470
But you on your own
decided to blindside Paul.

33:39.470 --> 33:43.010
What was the thinking behind not
telling anyone about that move?

33:43.010 --> 33:44.180
Because I knew
somebody was going

33:44.180 --> 33:45.680
to try and talk me out of it.

33:45.680 --> 33:46.880
I wanted it to be a big move.

33:46.880 --> 33:48.600
I wanted it to be my decision.

33:48.600 --> 33:49.330
So I went with it.

33:49.330 --> 33:50.300
But you seem strong-minded.

33:50.300 --> 33:51.560
I don't think someone
would have been

33:51.560 --> 33:53.240
able to talk you out of it.
- No.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.340
But I also didn't want them
to forewarn him either,

33:55.340 --> 33:56.960
because he's really
good at gaming the game

33:56.960 --> 33:57.870
and talking to people.

33:57.870 --> 33:59.600
So I didn't want him to
already be in their ear

33:59.600 --> 34:00.710
before it actually happened.

34:00.710 --> 34:01.960
But you didn't
even tell Jessica.

34:01.960 --> 34:03.810
- No.

34:03.810 --> 34:05.470
I knew she was going
to be pissed off about--

34:05.470 --> 34:06.170
can I say that?

34:06.170 --> 34:08.100
I knew she was going
to be mad about it.

34:08.100 --> 34:09.770
I mean, she's already mad
at, like, every decision

34:09.770 --> 34:10.690
I made in this game.

34:10.690 --> 34:12.320
She's called me the worst
player in "Big Brother"

34:12.320 --> 34:13.810
history multiple times.

34:13.810 --> 34:15.200
You're already like
a married couple.

34:15.200 --> 34:16.340
I know, yeah.

34:16.340 --> 34:18.710
So, I mean, her game is going
to be a lot better without me,

34:18.710 --> 34:19.520
I guarantee it.

34:19.520 --> 34:22.430
But then when Paul pulled
out that Pendant of Protection,

34:22.430 --> 34:24.680
on the spot you
went after someone

34:24.680 --> 34:28.100
else who everyone in the house
thought was in your alliance.

34:28.100 --> 34:29.980
Christmas thought
she was in the gang.

34:29.980 --> 34:30.680
Right.

34:30.680 --> 34:34.280
Why go after one
of your own so early?

34:34.280 --> 34:36.560
Paul and Christmas were,
like, on the outside fray

34:36.560 --> 34:39.140
of what I call, like,
the couples and Dom.

34:39.140 --> 34:41.570
And I don't know, Christmas
was so high anxiety

34:41.570 --> 34:43.490
and high emotion, any
time she was around,

34:43.490 --> 34:44.690
you could just feel
it in the group.

34:44.690 --> 34:47.840
Everyone would just
lose their calm.

34:47.840 --> 34:49.350
And she was also close to Paul.

34:49.350 --> 34:52.590
So once I went after Paul,
I had to go after Christmas.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.020
But didn't you think
at least for a while

34:54.020 --> 34:56.120
you could trust her?
- Yeah.

34:56.120 --> 34:59.530
I mean, she was good to go in
my book, on multiple levels.

34:59.530 --> 35:00.980
But, I mean, my weak--

35:00.980 --> 35:05.480
I was a third of the way into
nominating the entire house.

35:05.480 --> 35:09.430
So, I mean, I literally had
to take week one strategy,

35:09.430 --> 35:11.540
put the week four
strategy in week one.

35:11.540 --> 35:12.980
And I just kept moving
it down the line.

35:12.980 --> 35:14.870
Like, I had no time
to think about it.

35:14.870 --> 35:16.490
I mean, I was literally
a third of the way

35:16.490 --> 35:19.370
into nominating, like, the cast.

35:19.370 --> 35:23.060
When Paul first nominated
you, we didn't see you campaign.

35:23.060 --> 35:26.300
It almost appeared like you
threw in the towel, which does

35:26.300 --> 35:27.430
not seem like Cody's style.

35:27.430 --> 35:30.110
But in the last 24 hours, you
started to stir things up.

35:30.110 --> 35:32.690
- Right.
- And you made accusations.

35:32.690 --> 35:34.860
Why?
- I don't know.

35:34.860 --> 35:37.640
Just-- I mean, I wasn't going to
completely throw in the towel.

35:37.640 --> 35:38.810
Paul had these guys--

35:38.810 --> 35:40.370
I mean, they're like
groupies to him in there.

35:40.370 --> 35:43.380
Like, Paul tells a story, and
it's like, tell another one,

35:43.380 --> 35:44.480
Paul.
Tell another one.

35:44.480 --> 35:45.530
I mean, the guy just--

35:45.530 --> 35:46.610
the guy holds court in there.

35:46.610 --> 35:49.050
So I knew instantly--

35:49.050 --> 35:51.020
and I could see it during
that HOH competition.

35:51.020 --> 35:52.430
It was basically
a team competition

35:52.430 --> 35:54.650
where they just helped
Paul out with the tickets.

35:54.650 --> 35:56.210
And that's when I
knew all my loyalty

35:56.210 --> 35:57.380
was gone with these guys.

35:57.380 --> 35:59.900
Once I had no power, they
wanted nothing to do with me

35:59.900 --> 36:01.490
and everything to do with Paul.

36:01.490 --> 36:03.320
He has a good social game.

36:03.320 --> 36:05.150
You are very strong--
- Yeah.

36:05.150 --> 36:08.210
Physically, you're
good at competitions.

36:08.210 --> 36:10.500
You're not stupid.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.030
Do you have a social game?

36:12.030 --> 36:13.590
I swear-- I swear I do.

36:13.590 --> 36:15.810
But with those
people in there, I

36:15.810 --> 36:18.570
swear there's no loyalty in
like most of those people.

36:18.570 --> 36:22.270
So they're just going to keep
bouncing from person to person.

36:22.270 --> 36:24.390
I should have thought more with
my mind instead of my heart,

36:24.390 --> 36:25.980
but that's the way I play.

36:25.980 --> 36:27.690
If you could do--
all right, well then,

36:27.690 --> 36:28.770
is that what you would do over?

36:28.770 --> 36:32.410
If you could do anything
over again, what would it be?

36:32.410 --> 36:33.960
I would take the same risks--

36:33.960 --> 36:36.180
I just hate that
Den of Temptation.

36:36.180 --> 36:38.550
That's the only thing
that really got me, was--

36:38.550 --> 36:41.280
I mean, Paul literally has three
weeks of unfettered safety.

36:41.280 --> 36:43.440
That means he can play
in all competitions

36:43.440 --> 36:44.700
and still have that safety.

36:44.700 --> 36:46.020
So I thought it was a cheat.

36:46.020 --> 36:46.900
I didn't like it.

36:46.900 --> 36:47.850
But it is what it is.

36:47.850 --> 36:49.980
I took the chance,
and I don't regret it.

36:49.980 --> 36:52.020
Well, what if we said we
gave you a second chance?

36:52.020 --> 36:54.050
You're lying.

36:56.990 --> 36:58.780
I'm not lying, am I?

36:58.780 --> 37:00.820
There is yet another
twist in the game

37:00.820 --> 37:04.420
that you and everyone in
the house is unaware of.

37:04.420 --> 37:07.450
Next week, you, Cameron--

37:07.450 --> 37:08.460
remember Cameron?

37:08.460 --> 37:09.230
I-- vaguely.

37:09.230 --> 37:10.500
He was voted out
a few weeks ago.

37:10.500 --> 37:14.340
You, Cameron, Jillian,
and next week's evictee

37:14.340 --> 37:19.750
will get the chance to battle
back your way into the game.

37:19.750 --> 37:22.150
You game?

37:22.150 --> 37:24.220
I see revenge in those eyes.

37:24.220 --> 37:28.240
So, you might get a second
chance at the half million

37:28.240 --> 37:29.770
dollar prize.

37:29.770 --> 37:30.850
We're ready for you.

37:30.850 --> 37:31.660
Sound good?

37:31.660 --> 37:32.600
Are you guys--

37:32.600 --> 37:33.740
are you guys ready?

37:33.740 --> 37:35.320
Geez, I don't know.
- No, we're not--

37:35.320 --> 37:36.520
I didn't think I
was going to come

37:36.520 --> 37:37.970
out with anybody even cheering.

37:37.970 --> 37:40.390
I'm surprised by all this.

37:41.390 --> 37:42.880
You're a competitor.

37:42.880 --> 37:44.280
Stay right there.
- Sure.

37:44.280 --> 37:45.010
Don't go away.

37:45.010 --> 37:47.920
Up next, an epic
battle of endurance

37:47.920 --> 37:50.630
will determine who
rises to power.

37:50.630 --> 37:52.750
Who will become the
new head of household?

37:52.750 --> 37:54.930
Stay with us.

38:13.170 --> 38:15.660
Welcome back to "Big Brother".

38:15.660 --> 38:18.260
It's time for the live Head
of Household competition.

38:18.260 --> 38:19.800
Free from the
threat of eviction,

38:19.800 --> 38:23.930
the HOH must put two nominees
on the chopping block.

38:23.930 --> 38:26.960
Let's head to the backyard
and get things started.

38:26.960 --> 38:30.110
HouseGuests, power
is up for grabs.

38:30.110 --> 38:32.300
Paul, as outgoing
Head of Household,

38:32.300 --> 38:34.970
you are not eligible to compete.

38:34.970 --> 38:39.080
And just so you know, even
though Christmas is not here

38:39.080 --> 38:41.840
tonight, if she
was here, she would

38:41.840 --> 38:47.560
not have been medically cleared
to participate for this HOH.

38:47.560 --> 38:50.650
This competition is
called Space Cadets,

38:50.650 --> 38:53.290
and the concept is simple.

38:53.290 --> 38:56.000
Hang on for dear life.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.040
The last HouseGuest
standing on the arm

38:58.040 --> 38:59.720
of the "Big Brother"
space station

38:59.720 --> 39:03.050
will become the new
Head of Household.

39:03.050 --> 39:04.550
Does everyone understand?

39:04.550 --> 39:06.590
ALL: Yeah.

39:06.590 --> 39:07.550
JULIE CHEN: Great.

39:07.550 --> 39:12.620
Because this
competition starts now.

39:21.950 --> 39:23.570
Yeah, baby.

39:23.570 --> 39:26.730
This is not lit, you guys.
Not lit.

39:26.730 --> 39:28.710
Welcome to "Big Brother"!

39:34.640 --> 39:35.640
.

39:56.050 --> 39:57.310
Make .

40:01.700 --> 40:04.040
We'll rejoin this
all-important Head of Household

40:04.040 --> 40:05.930
competition in just a moment.

40:05.930 --> 40:09.410
But first, voting is
still open for this week's

40:09.410 --> 40:11.060
Den of Temptation.

40:11.060 --> 40:12.640
Here's how to vote?

40:12.640 --> 40:15.480
ANNOUNCER: It's time
for America's vote.

40:15.480 --> 40:18.450
You can vote to tempt the
HouseGuest of your choice

40:18.450 --> 40:21.780
inside the Den of Temptation.

40:21.780 --> 40:23.820
Each temptation offers
an advantage that

40:23.820 --> 40:25.470
could help them in the game.

40:25.470 --> 40:28.200
But remember, it also
comes with a consequence

40:28.200 --> 40:31.170
that will affect one or
more of their housemates.

40:31.170 --> 40:35.790
The third temptation
is the Halting Hex.

40:35.790 --> 40:38.940
Who do you want to receive
this week's temptation?

40:38.940 --> 40:44.580
Go to cbs.com/bbvote for all
the details and to vote now.

40:44.580 --> 40:46.830
Remember, a
HouseGuest can only be

40:46.830 --> 40:49.890
tempted inside the Den
of Temptation once,

40:49.890 --> 40:52.020
so choose wisely.

40:52.020 --> 40:54.780
For free online voting,
go to cbs.com/bbvote.

40:54.780 --> 40:56.720

Votes will be accepted
until July 19, 2017,

40:58.740 --> 41:00.120
at 8:59 AM, Pacific time.

41:11.410 --> 41:13.140
Welcome back to "Big Brother."

41:13.140 --> 41:16.590
Tune in Sunday to see the
conclusion of this ongoing HOH

41:16.590 --> 41:21.120
competition and to see who the
new HOH nominates for eviction.

41:21.120 --> 41:23.940
Then on Wednesday, could
the veto change the nominees

41:23.940 --> 41:25.640
for a third week in a row?

41:25.640 --> 41:28.470
And next Thursday, it's
another live vote and eviction.

41:28.470 --> 41:30.630
Plus find out which
HouseGuests will

41:30.630 --> 41:34.380
be tempted in the final Den
of Temptation of the summer.

41:34.380 --> 41:38.670
And then a week from
tomorrow on Friday, July 21,

41:38.670 --> 41:41.140
it's the Battle Back
Showdown episode,

41:41.140 --> 41:44.460
where Cameron, Jillian,
Cody, and next week's evictee

41:44.460 --> 41:47.520
will fight for a chance to
get back into the house.

41:47.520 --> 41:50.460
And in a "Big Brother"
first, the HouseGuests

41:50.460 --> 41:54.420
will get the chance to stop
their return to the game.

41:54.420 --> 41:59.820
Head to cbs.com/bb19 right now

41:59.820 --> 42:02.100

42:07.740 --> 42:09.930
Find your channel at poptv.com.

42:09.930 --> 42:11.970
For now, let's return
to the backyard

42:11.970 --> 42:14.410
and check in on the HouseGuests.

42:14.410 --> 42:16.840
HouseGuests, how
is everyone doing?

42:16.840 --> 42:18.390
- Yeah!
- Heck yeah!

42:18.390 --> 42:20.460
JULIE CHEN: Well, I
suggest you hold on tight.

42:20.460 --> 42:23.510
And remember, in
space, even "Big

42:23.510 --> 42:25.550
Brother" can't hear you scream.

42:25.550 --> 42:27.050
- Oh!
- Julie!

42:30.650 --> 42:32.750
JULIE CHEN: Good
night, HouseGuests.

42:44.450 --> 42:46.250
You damn meatballs!

42:46.250 --> 42:48.650
Meatballs better start dropping.

42:48.650 --> 42:51.050
Meatballs better
start frying, baby.

42:58.550 --> 43:01.550
It's very cold!

43:01.550 --> 43:03.650
.
You blew it!
