SHE'S STILL INVOLVED IN

00:22.167 --> 00:22.900
YOUR RELATIONSHIP?

00:22.900 --> 00:24.067
THAT'S THE THING, DAD.

00:24.067 --> 00:25.000
'CAUSE IF YOU GO SOMEWHERE

00:27.867 --> 00:29.367

02:31.933 --> 02:33.633
BE ABLE TO HANDLE IT BY HIMSELF,

02:33.633 --> 02:35.567
AND WHEN NIKKO CAME IN, I WAS

LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, HE'S GONNA

02:36.900 --> 02:39.067
MAKE IT OKAY."

02:39.067 --> 02:40.700
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN LIKE THAT,

03:02.067 --> 03:03.600
LIKE THAT THAT SHE BARELY KNEW.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.100

03:05.100 --> 03:06.400
SHE JUST WASN'T RIGHT AT ALL.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.767
COULD HE HAVE HANDLED IT

03:07.767 --> 03:08.467
BETTER?

03:08.467 --> 03:09.400
ABSOLUTELY.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.467
BUT THE ROOT OF THIS WHOLE THING

03:11.467 --> 03:13.367
IS K. MICHELLE, PERIOD.

03:13.367 --> 03:14.433
SHE WANTED YOU TO COME TO HER

03:17.700 --> 03:19.533

03:20.300 --> 03:21.833
OKAY, WELL, I DON'T SEE WHAT

03:21.833 --> 03:23.233
THE [bleep] PROBLEM IS.

I WASN'T EVEN IN THE ROOM WHEN

03:24.433 --> 03:25.333
ANY OF THIS WENT DOWN.

03:25.333 --> 03:26.067
I'M OUTSIDE--

03:26.067 --> 03:26.933
WOULD YOU HAVE A CONVERSATION

03:26.933 --> 03:27.600
WITH HER?

03:27.600 --> 03:28.267
NO, I DID NOT.

03:28.267 --> 03:29.167
I SAID WOULD YOU.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.333
OF COURSE I WOULD.

03:30.333 --> 03:31.100
OKAY.

03:31.100 --> 03:32.067
BUT I'M NOT GONNA SIT THERE

03:32.067 --> 03:33.367

03:40.433 --> 03:41.133
I'M SURE.

03:41.133 --> 03:41.833
YOU WANT TO COME?

03:41.833 --> 03:43.467
WHY WOULD I FLY TO NEW YORK?

03:43.467 --> 03:45.300
I'M SAYING I'M GONNA SEE HER,

03:45.300 --> 03:46.967
SO WE COULD TRY TO JUST KIND OF

03:46.967 --> 03:47.833

19:27.067 --> 19:27.700
LIKE, I DON'T EVEN...

19:27.700 --> 19:29.700

19:37.067 --> 19:38.300

19:39.800 --> 19:41.367

19:41.367 --> 19:42.300
PROCESS SERIOUSLY.

19:42.300 --> 19:44.133
HE'D RATHER INTERVIEW GROUPIE

19:44.133 --> 19:45.900

19:49.800 --> 19:50.733
I'M SERIOUS.

19:50.733 --> 19:51.867
THAT LAST INTERVIEW WAS

19:51.867 --> 19:52.633
HORRIBLE.

19:52.633 --> 19:53.400
IT WENT TO THE LEFT--

19:53.400 --> 19:54.267
I DON'T AGREE IT WAS

19:54.267 --> 19:54.933
HORRIBLE.

19:54.933 --> 19:55.600
THE GIRLS LOOKED GOOD.

19:55.600 --> 19:56.733
THEY WERE...

19:56.733 --> 19:57.533
THEY WERE PRETTY.

19:57.533 --> 19:58.533
THEY JUST DIDN'T BRING RESUMES.

19:58.533 --> 20:00.067
ALL YOU HAD WAS MODEL HOS.

20:00.067 --> 20:00.833
I GOT THAT, BUT YOU CAN'T

20:00.833 --> 20:01.700
HAVE AN INTERVIEW

20:01.700 --> 20:02.400
PROCESS WITHOUT ME.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.600
IF I HAD YOU THERE, IT WOULD

20:03.600 --> 20:04.467
HAVE WENT TO THE LEFT AGAIN,

20:04.467 --> 20:05.400
AND YOU WOULD HAVE HAD MORE

20:05.400 --> 20:06.967
VIDEO HOS WALKING

20:06.967 --> 20:07.633
DOWN THE DOOR.

20:07.633 --> 20:08.300
HOW DO YOU KNOW HIM?

20:08.300 --> 20:09.167

ARE YOU SERIOUS?

20:12.800 --> 20:13.500
LISTEN.

20:13.500 --> 20:14.167
IT'S A QUESTION.

20:14.167 --> 20:15.133
WHAT MATTERS TO ME IS THAT WE

20:15.133 --> 20:16.233
PUT GOOD PEOPLE IN HERE,

20:16.233 --> 20:17.100

22:21.967 --> 22:22.667
WE COULD DEFINITELY

22:22.667 --> 22:23.500
WORK WITH THAT.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.067
AND I HEARD YOU A HALF PIT,

22:25.067 --> 22:26.067

22:27.400 --> 22:28.167
YEAH, I MIGHT HAVE LITTLE

22:28.167 --> 22:28.833
PAWS.

22:28.833 --> 22:29.733
YOU MIGHT NEED TO WALK ME.

22:29.733 --> 22:30.467
YEAH, WHAT YOU GOT--

22:30.467 --> 22:31.467

22:35.600 --> 22:36.667
OKAY.

22:36.667 --> 22:39.400

22:39.400 --> 22:40.933

22:40.933 --> 22:42.367
IT, LIKE YOU SAID, HE PROBABLY

22:42.367 --> 22:43.367
WAS HOLDING IT FIRST IN

22:43.367 --> 22:44.067
THE BEGINNING.

22:44.067 --> 22:44.700
HE'S LIKE, "WHEN THEY

22:44.700 --> 22:45.367
GONNA LET ME OUT?"

22:45.367 --> 22:46.400
YOU KNOW, SO WE GONNA HAVE TO

22:46.400 --> 22:48.167
KIND OF LET HIM OUT A LITTLE BIT

22:48.167 --> 22:49.567
MORE INITIALLY IN THE BEGINNING

22:49.567 --> 22:51.367
JUST SO HE CAN START SAYING,

22:51.367 --> 22:53.067
"HEY, OKAY, I DON'T HAVE TO HOLD

22:53.067 --> 22:54.367
IT THAT LONG, SO I KNOW MY NEXT

22:54.367 --> 22:55.467

22:56.967 --> 22:58.933

25:14.367 --> 25:15.900
MY TIME WHEN YOU'RE NOT EVEN

25:15.900 --> 25:16.900

25:37.067 --> 25:38.333
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT

25:38.333 --> 25:39.067
ANYMORE.

25:39.067 --> 25:40.200
I SAID, "I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU

25:40.200 --> 25:41.433
A DIFFERENT LEVEL THAT I'M ON

25:41.433 --> 25:42.767

25:44.600 --> 25:45.667
I DON'T KNOW.

25:45.667 --> 25:46.600
YOU DON'T KNOW?

25:46.600 --> 25:47.467
ALL RIGHT.

25:47.467 --> 25:48.333
FINE, COOL.

25:48.333 --> 25:49.500
I CAN'T POSSIBLY KNOW IF I'M

41:46.233 --> 41:47.233
THAT'S WHY SHE MISTREATED HIM

41:47.233 --> 41:47.933
AND GAVE HIM THE BOOT.

41:47.933 --> 41:49.933
OKAY.
