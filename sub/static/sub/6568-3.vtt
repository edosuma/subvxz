00:18.484 --> 00:19.985
Are you watching this?
Look at this.

00:19.986 --> 00:22.889
Sean Penn is doing more about
the hostages than we are.

00:22.890 --> 00:25.626
These poor kids...
they're like Catherine's age.

00:25.627 --> 00:29.431
I'd be terrible in a hostage
situation, even as a hostage taker.

00:29.432 --> 00:31.234
So, ma'am, no word yet
from the Secretary of Defense

00:31.235 --> 00:32.702
about joining him
at the Marine base?

00:32.703 --> 00:34.270
Uh, no, nothing from Maddox,

00:34.271 --> 00:36.505
but he knows I've got a bigger
role in the White House now,

00:36.506 --> 00:38.942
which means I've got a bigger
dick, which means he can suck it.

00:38.943 --> 00:41.179
I'm so happy about that.
How's my speech coming?

00:41.180 --> 00:43.215
Oh, one minor change.
Just one word, really.

00:43.216 --> 00:46.252
"Considered response" is now
gonna be "robust response."

00:46.253 --> 00:48.254
Robust?
Damn, that's good.

00:48.255 --> 00:51.225
Yeah, I mean, it's subtle
enough to seem loyal to POTUS.

00:51.226 --> 00:54.095
- That's gonna electrify DC.
- Oh, it's gonna AC DC.

00:54.096 --> 00:55.863
Robust is a good word.

00:55.864 --> 00:57.965
And you don't hear it often,
like bumptious.

00:57.966 --> 01:00.769
Yeah, it's what you want
to hear in a hostage crisis.

01:00.770 --> 01:02.305
Robust, not bumptious.

01:02.306 --> 01:05.007
Mike, what do you think?
What do you think about robust?

01:05.007 --> 01:07.476
Robust? I like it.
It makes me think of wine.

01:07.477 --> 01:09.077
It's actually
how I like my reds.

01:09.078 --> 01:11.179
You like your reds through a
bendy straw, too, right, Mike?

01:11.180 --> 01:13.114
You got donut on you, Mike.

01:13.115 --> 01:14.883
Sue, good luck at the hearing.

01:14.884 --> 01:18.854
- Remember, Sue, be dull.
- I will.

01:18.855 --> 01:21.590
Are you here for a meeting?
I'm not expecting anyone.

01:21.591 --> 01:24.293
- Sue, I'm your fill-in, Cliff.
- Cliff. Hey, I'm Gary.

01:24.294 --> 01:27.897
I'm your neighbor.
Remember, take care of Selina, okay?

01:27.898 --> 01:30.133
VP stands
for "very precious."

01:30.134 --> 01:32.268
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:32.269 --> 01:33.336
- Cliff.
- Yes.

01:33.337 --> 01:34.738
This is the Veeplopedia.

01:34.739 --> 01:36.173
It's everything
you'll ever need to know.

01:36.174 --> 01:38.976
Wow. Hope it comes
with CliffsNotes.

01:40.479 --> 01:43.715
That was a play on my name.
My name is Cliff.

01:43.716 --> 01:45.484
Don't do jokes, Cliff.

01:45.485 --> 01:47.652
I don't have a sense of humor
and neither should you.

01:51.322 --> 01:52.604
Good morning.

01:52.605 --> 01:55.019
How do you make two perfectly pleasant words
so irritating?

01:55.020 --> 01:56.790
And here he is, the man
who can't take a leak

01:56.791 --> 01:58.224
without polling his balls.

01:58.225 --> 02:00.493
Bring me my cerise-colored
binder, Jonah.

02:00.494 --> 02:03.226
Cerise?
Yes, sir.

02:03.227 --> 02:05.091
The VP's base visit today.

02:05.092 --> 02:07.289
Secretary of Defense Maddox
is living up to his name.

02:07.290 --> 02:09.454
He's mad as an ox.

02:09.455 --> 02:11.617
I'm sure I can break up
any catfights when I get there.

02:11.618 --> 02:14.249
The veep's more concerned
with the hostage situation.

02:14.250 --> 02:15.981
Yeah, I was talking
to POTUS last night.

02:15.982 --> 02:19.043
He had a pro-strike hawk
boner the size of Jonah.

02:19.044 --> 02:21.140
And then you talked to him
about it this morning

02:21.141 --> 02:23.875
and he's suddenly
totally against the operation.

02:23.876 --> 02:26.010
All I do is provide POTUS
with the polls.

02:26.011 --> 02:28.045
<i>- Cold numbers.
- God, I hate numbers.</i>

02:28.046 --> 02:30.948
There's cultures that don't even have
any numbers and they do just fine.

02:30.949 --> 02:34.251
Well, Ben, it seems like you're ill-suited
for your job and you should resign.

02:34.252 --> 02:36.819
Ben's breakdown aside,
the VP feels we need

02:36.820 --> 02:38.353
a quick military strike here.

02:38.354 --> 02:41.119
Yeah, precise and surgical,
like your lobotomy, Kent.

02:41.120 --> 02:44.510
- The cerise binders, sir.
- No, that's cherry red.

02:44.511 --> 02:47.062
- Cerise.
- I'm sorry, sir.

02:47.063 --> 02:49.490
I must have a very specific
form of color blindness.

02:49.491 --> 02:51.553
I cook these noodles every day.

02:51.554 --> 02:53.651
Oh, the noodle analogy.

02:53.652 --> 02:55.384
You guys are gonna love this.

02:56.984 --> 02:58.613
I will leave.

02:58.614 --> 03:00.113
They need to be heated
at 800 watts

03:00.114 --> 03:01.645
for three minutes
and 35 seconds.

03:01.646 --> 03:03.179
Any more and they'll dry out.

03:03.180 --> 03:05.445
Any less and they will be
flaccid and damp

03:05.446 --> 03:07.709
like a lady's hair in the rain.

03:07.710 --> 03:09.941
- Why are we talking about noodles?
- No, let me rephrase that.

03:09.942 --> 03:11.873
Why the fuck are we talking
about noodles?

03:11.874 --> 03:15.338
I'll tell you why.
Hostage crisis, noodles... same principle.

03:15.339 --> 03:18.504
Both require precision timing,
neither should be rushed.

03:18.505 --> 03:21.832
Inaction only becomes untenable
when more than 65% of Americans

03:21.833 --> 03:24.464
support intervention
even with casualties.

03:24.465 --> 03:27.552
So you'd like me to tell the vice
president we do nothing until then?

03:27.553 --> 03:29.374
Waiting is not doing nothing.

03:29.375 --> 03:32.009
I choose to wait for my noodles

03:32.010 --> 03:34.442
even though my salivary glands
are crying out to me

03:34.443 --> 03:36.232
like newly hatched birds.

03:36.233 --> 03:39.890
But they will thank me
because I waited until...

03:42.403 --> 03:47.183
You just timed out
that whole shit analogy

03:47.184 --> 03:49.028
for your little ding?

03:49.029 --> 03:51.307
That is fucking pathetic.

03:55.300 --> 03:57.144
Hey, have we heard
anything from Maddox?

03:57.145 --> 03:59.524
Is he spitting bullets 'cause
I'm showing up at the base?

03:59.525 --> 04:00.836
- Nothing. Nada.
- Really?

04:00.837 --> 04:03.315
- It's eerie, right?
- It is eerie.

04:04.962 --> 04:06.973
Hey, Neilio. We're in.

04:06.974 --> 04:08.686
<i>See you in there, I guess.</i>

04:08.687 --> 04:11.098
Okay. Thanks.

04:11.099 --> 04:14.001
Probably got his head
stuck in her ass.

04:14.002 --> 04:16.569
Yes, I do.
Oh, my gosh, yes.

04:16.570 --> 04:19.048
Hey, ma'am, you've got five minutes
of veep time before Maddox arrives.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.660
- Yeah.
- They're not saluting you.

04:20.661 --> 04:21.882
They don't salute
indoors, Gary.

04:21.884 --> 04:23.629
They don't salute
indoors, Gary.

04:23.630 --> 04:25.152
- Good morning, Marine.
- Ma'am.

04:25.153 --> 04:27.098
You served in Iraq?
I see.

04:27.099 --> 04:29.299
And were you anywhere near...

04:29.300 --> 04:30.422
- Baghdad.
- Anbar.

04:30.423 --> 04:31.945
- ...Anbar?
- Yes.

04:31.946 --> 04:33.324
Anbar, wonderful.

04:33.325 --> 04:35.014
Ma'am, this base
houses Marine 2.

04:35.015 --> 04:37.682
I understand
that Marine 2 is here.

04:37.683 --> 04:40.617
And did you know in the CD player
I've got "Ride of the Valkyries"?

04:40.618 --> 04:42.496
"Apocalypse Now."

04:42.497 --> 04:45.076
That's one of my favorite films.
It's dark, but I like it.

04:45.077 --> 04:46.955
- Marines like to be called Devil Dogs.
- Devil Dogs.

04:46.956 --> 04:50.246
You are a bunch of Devil Dogs,
that's what I hear.

04:50.247 --> 04:52.325
I was married to a Devil Dog,
but he wasn't a Marine.

04:52.326 --> 04:55.093
He was more of a devil.

04:55.094 --> 04:57.906
She's so funny.

04:57.907 --> 05:00.875
Thank you for your service.

05:00.876 --> 05:03.744
- Good morning, Marine.
- He has a nice face.

05:03.745 --> 05:06.413
- You have a nice face.
- Thank you, ma'am.

05:06.414 --> 05:08.959
And where did
you serve, Marine?

05:18.289 --> 05:20.601
Cease fire!
Cease fire!

05:20.602 --> 05:24.159
These small arms have a max
effective range of 25 yards.

05:24.160 --> 05:25.749
Small arms means guns, ma'am.

05:25.750 --> 05:27.795
- Oh, really, Gary? Not T-rex hands?
- Okay.

05:27.796 --> 05:30.173
Mr. Secretary,
would you like to try?

05:30.174 --> 05:32.453
No, I'm good.
I've fired a gun before.

05:32.454 --> 05:33.598
Okay.

05:33.599 --> 05:36.311
- In anger, too, I might add.
- Oh, uh-oh.

05:36.312 --> 05:38.479
But why don't you give it
a try, Madam Vice President?

05:38.480 --> 05:41.614
Oh, I don't...

05:41.615 --> 05:45.016
Um, can you give me
just half a sec?

05:45.017 --> 05:47.096
What the fuck?

05:47.097 --> 05:49.175
- This could backfire.
- It's not gonna backfire.

05:49.176 --> 05:51.578
The gun could literally backfire.
That's where the phrase comes from.

05:51.579 --> 05:53.458
Ma'am, this could really
chap Maddox's ass, too.

05:53.459 --> 05:54.982
Oh, yeah, it
would, wouldn't it?

05:54.983 --> 05:57.262
You could chip a veneer and I
don't really want that to happen.

05:57.263 --> 05:58.840
I don't care.
I'm going in.

05:58.841 --> 06:00.821
You know what? Let's lock and load.
What do you say?

06:00.822 --> 06:03.759
Yeah? Yeah.

06:03.760 --> 06:06.008
Here he is, Kanye West Wing.

06:06.009 --> 06:07.790
Congressman Ramsey, right?

06:07.791 --> 06:10.507
No, I'm Cliff.
I'm Sue's Sue.

06:10.508 --> 06:13.078
- I'm the boy named Sue.
- What?

06:13.079 --> 06:15.716
Cliff, when I said no jokes,
that wasn't a joke.

06:15.717 --> 06:18.558
Sue, Hessler's efficiency hearing,
you've got to keep it dull, okay?

06:18.559 --> 06:21.596
Give 'em a blah job.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

06:21.597 --> 06:23.708
I know, Jonah.
That's what everyone's been saying.

06:23.709 --> 06:27.177
Keep it dull, which
incidentally, is also dull.

06:28.556 --> 06:31.001
I'd like to first of all
thank the vice president

06:31.002 --> 06:33.214
for waiving executive privilege

06:33.215 --> 06:34.960
in the interest of transparency

06:34.961 --> 06:38.853
and allowing Miss Wilson to
join us today on the committee.

06:38.854 --> 06:40.868
Do you think she's nervous?

06:40.869 --> 06:43.022
Why would she be nervous?

06:43.023 --> 06:44.812
The only people
watching this are you

06:44.813 --> 06:47.299
and some guy in the hospital
with locked-in syndrome.

06:47.300 --> 06:49.809
If I may, I'd like
to begin with percentages

06:49.810 --> 06:52.459
of your office budget
dedicated to international

06:52.460 --> 06:55.821
<i>- and domestic transportation.
- My pulse is racing, sir.</i>

06:55.822 --> 06:57.347
Here you are,
Madam Vice President.

06:57.348 --> 06:58.963
Ensure you keep your finger
straight and off the trigger.

06:58.964 --> 07:01.445
All right.
This is fun, isn't it?

07:01.446 --> 07:05.008
If you don't mind my saying, ma'am,
there speaketh a civilian.

07:05.009 --> 07:07.781
All right.
There speaketh a pricketh.

07:10.065 --> 07:13.104
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ!

07:13.105 --> 07:15.644
Oh!

07:15.645 --> 07:18.160
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I didn't...

07:18.161 --> 07:20.111
These fellas have heard a
lot worse than that, ma'am.

07:20.112 --> 07:22.294
- Tremendous shot, by the way.
- Really?

07:22.295 --> 07:26.293
Oh, how about that?
Fastest gun in the West Wing.

07:26.294 --> 07:29.032
<i- >- - Did you see that? How about it?
Yes, ma'am.

07:29.033 --> 07:32.170
As you know, we have a very
special guest here today.

07:32.171 --> 07:35.072
It would have been nice to have been
consulted about your speech, ma'am.

07:35.073 --> 07:37.474
I could have given you
some advice.

07:37.475 --> 07:39.076
I know what I'm doing, George.

07:39.077 --> 07:40.944
With this hostage situation,

07:40.945 --> 07:43.380
I don't think you have
the intelligence.

07:44.950 --> 07:47.718
As in intel, of course, ma'am.

07:47.719 --> 07:49.120
Are you serious?

07:49.121 --> 07:51.923
Are you actually questioning
my qualifications, George?

07:51.924 --> 07:54.626
There are just
some security issues

07:54.627 --> 07:57.662
with the four countries
that neighbor Uzbekistan.

07:59.299 --> 08:01.600
Is it four or is it five?

08:03.403 --> 08:06.171
Or is it six?
Or is it seven?

08:06.172 --> 08:08.306
You don't know, do you?

08:10.376 --> 08:12.277
It's five.

08:12.278 --> 08:16.081
So first, please welcome the
Secretary of Defense George Maddox.

08:18.084 --> 08:19.985
I pulled that
straight out of my ass.

08:19.986 --> 08:22.121
You were born for that moment.

08:22.122 --> 08:23.923
I know.
He's Iwo Jima.

08:23.924 --> 08:26.326
I'm planting a flag
right on his head.

08:26.327 --> 08:29.963
Now I'd like to work
on breaking down

08:29.964 --> 08:33.534
the vice president's official

08:33.534 --> 08:36.070
<i>versus political
duties if we can.</i>

08:36.071 --> 08:39.106
Sir, I was told that I'd be asked
questions about efficiency.

08:39.107 --> 08:41.509
So far you have
barely asked me any.

08:41.510 --> 08:44.545
Your efficiency hearing
isn't very efficient.

08:44.546 --> 08:46.714
You want a question?
What can you tell me

08:46.715 --> 08:48.849
about this visit to
the Marine base at Quantico?

08:48.850 --> 08:52.620
The government sending two different
motorcades, the defense secretary's

08:52.621 --> 08:54.989
and the VP's,
to the same location.

08:54.990 --> 08:58.225
- That doesn't seem very efficient.
- Oh, shit a shark.

08:58.226 --> 08:59.994
This is why I told her
to be dull.

08:59.995 --> 09:03.131
Do you not have measures
in place to prevent

09:03.132 --> 09:05.733
this kind of wasteful duplication
of government resources?

09:05.734 --> 09:09.204
Sir, we have a system
that I believe to be...

09:09.205 --> 09:11.072
robust.

09:11.073 --> 09:13.909
- Robust?
- Robust.

09:13.910 --> 09:15.244
<i>And you don't think it's a sign</i>

09:15.245 --> 09:17.813
that your office
is poorly managed?

09:17.814 --> 09:22.284
Our management team
is... robust.

09:22.285 --> 09:24.753
Okay, now she just sounds
mentally ill.

09:24.754 --> 09:26.889
Don't you have somewhere
you're supposed to be?

09:26.890 --> 09:28.391
I'm working remotely.

09:28.392 --> 09:31.261
I'm guessing you have one of
those word a day calendars.

09:31.262 --> 09:33.663
And I know what the word
for today is.

09:33.664 --> 09:35.365
It's robust.

09:35.366 --> 09:37.733
<i>Would you like to give me
a definition as well?</i>

09:37.734 --> 09:41.670
Well, I'm guessing that you think you
have a sense of humor, Mr. Hessler.

09:41.671 --> 09:45.107
Which you are wrong about,
as you are about the calendar.

09:45.108 --> 09:48.410
That is my definition
of robust.

09:48.411 --> 09:51.379
My speech is a face-melter.
These buzz cuts are gonna flip.

09:51.380 --> 09:53.915
It's not your speech.
My fingerprints are all over that sucker.

09:53.916 --> 09:56.351
They're sticky and they're
on the back, Mike.

09:56.352 --> 09:59.487
It's time to robust a nut
all over this place.

09:59.488 --> 10:01.222
- Oh, shit. We can't.
- What?

10:01.223 --> 10:04.292
Sue, she just used robust
three times at the hearing.

10:04.293 --> 10:05.894
- No, she didn't.
- Yeah. What the...?

10:05.895 --> 10:07.796
Selina can't use that now.
We need another word.

10:07.797 --> 10:09.231
Just a synonym for robust.

10:09.232 --> 10:11.300
Give me something.
Give me a word. Any word!

10:11.301 --> 10:11.933
Aggressive.

10:12.055 --> 10:13.459
No, that's too aggressive.
We don't want to say that.

10:13.494 --> 10:15.905
- Okay, resolute.
- Determined.

10:15.906 --> 10:18.307
- That's the exact same thing as resolute.
- Then we'll use mine.

10:18.308 --> 10:20.544
Explosive. Punchy. Fearless.
I'm just saying words.

10:20.545 --> 10:22.646
- Strong. Go with strong.
- Strong? Strong, got it.

10:22.647 --> 10:24.715
Gary, I need the speech.
I need the vice president's ear.

10:24.716 --> 10:26.217
Get your own ear, van Gogh.

10:26.218 --> 10:27.552
Back off.

10:27.553 --> 10:29.921
Thank you.

10:29.922 --> 10:32.691
<i>- Thank you.
- What the hell?</i>

10:32.692 --> 10:34.593
Good morning, Marines!

10:35.561 --> 10:37.996
- Oorah.
- Oorah!

10:37.997 --> 10:40.865
Oh, my goodness.

10:40.866 --> 10:44.135
We who have answered
the call to serve

10:44.136 --> 10:47.338
this great nation know this,

10:47.339 --> 10:50.408
<i>that those who
challenge our freedoms</i>

10:50.409 --> 10:54.246
can expect a robust response.

10:54.247 --> 10:57.515
- There goes the R-bomb.
- I thought we weren't doing robust.

10:57.516 --> 10:59.183
I thought we were
still on considered.

10:59.184 --> 11:02.720
We have the best military
in the world.

11:05.557 --> 11:08.793
And we are not afraid.

11:10.963 --> 11:12.497
- Hey, Mike?
- Yes, ma'am.

11:12.498 --> 11:14.232
Stick a thermometer
up Washington's ass.

11:14.233 --> 11:16.134
See how much heat
I just created.

11:16.135 --> 11:18.236
Parting the cheeks.

11:19.538 --> 11:22.607
You know robust is my word.
She stole my word.

11:22.608 --> 11:24.275
She was supposed
to be dull, Mike.

11:24.276 --> 11:26.878
<i>And did you see that photo
of me in "Politico"?</i>

11:26.879 --> 11:28.780
<i>My God, I look constipated.</i>

11:28.781 --> 11:30.682
- No, you don't.
- Meet me in my office.

11:30.683 --> 11:32.718
<i>You don't look constipated.
You look the opposite of it.</i>

11:32.719 --> 11:34.520
What's the opposite
of constipated, Mike?

11:34.521 --> 11:36.088
- Relieved.
- No.

11:36.089 --> 11:38.990
Relieved is not the opposite
of constipated, Mike.

11:38.991 --> 11:41.093
Hang up the phone, dummy.

11:41.094 --> 11:42.995
- Hey, ma'am, you seen this yet?
- What is it?

11:42.996 --> 11:44.429
Just the "Post."

11:44.430 --> 11:48.834
"VP sister act
robusting the moves"?

11:48.835 --> 11:51.103
Ma'am, there's
also... yeah.

11:52.438 --> 11:54.506
What in the living
fuck is this?

11:54.507 --> 11:57.242
It's a word cloud from
this morning's "DC Press."

11:57.243 --> 12:00.478
The size of each word corresponds
to its total number of uses.

12:00.479 --> 12:02.447
Do people not use
sentences anymore?

12:02.448 --> 12:04.849
Well, I mean, your word...
I mean, robust is dominating.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.584
So, you know, that's good.

12:06.585 --> 12:08.085
Look at the word Sue.

12:08.086 --> 12:10.554
- Sue made it.
- Sure. It's there, too.

12:10.555 --> 12:11.888
Well, where's the word Selina?

12:11.889 --> 12:13.723
Oh, it, um...

12:13.724 --> 12:15.759
It's, uh...

12:15.760 --> 12:18.428
I just saw it.

12:18.429 --> 12:20.363
Ha! There.
There it is.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.864
Look how teeny tiny that is.

12:21.865 --> 12:23.767
It's bigger than collapse.

12:23.768 --> 12:26.336
It's teeny tiny because
technically you have four names.

12:26.337 --> 12:27.904
Vice President Selina Meyer.

12:27.905 --> 12:30.673
Yeah, plus all the nicknames
that we don't talk about.

12:30.674 --> 12:33.910
I mean, Sue only has one name
like Pocahontas or Hitler.

12:33.911 --> 12:36.179
- Or Moby or Bigfoot.
- Hey, Sue!

12:36.180 --> 12:38.581
- Sue!
- Yes, ma'am?

12:38.582 --> 12:41.184
What?
You're not fucking Sue.

12:41.185 --> 12:43.553
I'm Cliff.
I'm filling in for Sue

12:43.554 --> 12:45.621
while she preps for her return
appearance on the sixth.

12:45.622 --> 12:47.257
She has a return appearance?

12:47.258 --> 12:48.591
What does she need
an encore for?

12:48.592 --> 12:50.560
Yeah, it's an encore.
Start popping your popcorn.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.095
- Okay, thank you very much.
- Must Sue TV.

12:52.096 --> 12:53.596
I said that's enough.
Thank you.

12:53.597 --> 12:55.098
Gary, we need to start prepping

12:55.099 --> 12:56.767
for the whole senator
swearing-in thing.

12:56.768 --> 12:59.836
- Oh, yeah. It's Gary-oke time.
- Yes, it is.

12:59.837 --> 13:02.004
All right, I put together
one card for each senator.

13:02.005 --> 13:04.707
Actually, ma'am, I had some ideas
about some opportunities here.

13:04.708 --> 13:07.343
I think it'd be a good idea
if we focus more

13:07.344 --> 13:10.746
on each senator's particular policy
interests rather than small talk.

13:10.747 --> 13:13.348
- Yeah, I don't think that's a bad idea.
- What?

13:13.349 --> 13:15.450
Yeah, take the coat.
That makes sense to me.

13:15.451 --> 13:16.651
I think that...
oh, there's Sue.

13:16.652 --> 13:18.754
Okay, get away from me.
Sue!

13:18.755 --> 13:21.823
Sue!
No, the real Sue.

13:21.824 --> 13:24.126
You stay away from her ear.
Do you hear me?

13:24.127 --> 13:26.595
Gary-oke is done, my friend.
It's time for Danny-oke now.

13:26.596 --> 13:30.032
- Danny-oke?
- End of an era, buddy. End of an era.

13:30.033 --> 13:32.401
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not famous.

13:32.402 --> 13:34.303
Maybe only in DC.

13:34.304 --> 13:36.605
Oh, yeah,
me and Kim Kardashian.

13:36.606 --> 13:38.774
Oh, I've got to go.
Bye, bye, bye. Ma'am?

13:38.775 --> 13:41.544
- Why don't you take a seat, Sue?
- Oh, sorry, ma'am.

13:41.545 --> 13:43.213
Sit down, Sue.

13:43.214 --> 13:45.182
All right, I've got
a bone to pick...

13:45.183 --> 13:47.184
Ma'am, I know you really love me,
but now you're gonna hate me.

13:47.185 --> 13:47.925
What?

13:48.038 --> 13:50.245
Sec Def Maddox just did an interview
with Bloomberg.

13:50.280 --> 13:51.114
Yeah?

13:51.174 --> 13:53.309
He's now calling
for an aggressive response.

13:53.344 --> 13:56.295
<i- >- - Aggressive?
Yeah, I just got that, too.

13:56.296 --> 13:58.363
Does aggressive trump robust?

13:58.364 --> 14:00.098
Well, it's robustier.

14:00.099 --> 14:02.634
No, robust is like a rock
and aggressive is like paper.

14:02.635 --> 14:04.770
Oh, shoot, paper covers rock.
I forget about that.

14:04.771 --> 14:07.439
- We just got a text from Ben.
- And? What's his word?

14:07.440 --> 14:10.742
His word is "get-the-vice-president-over-here
right-now-we're-having-a-fucking-meeting."

14:10.743 --> 14:13.211
It's all one word hyphenated.

14:14.613 --> 14:16.314
Remind me, you said what?

14:16.315 --> 14:18.182
- Your response needs to be what?
- Robust.

14:18.183 --> 14:20.318
- Robust. And you said?
- Aggressive.

14:20.319 --> 14:22.653
- You see the problem?
- No, I don't.

14:22.654 --> 14:23.921
They're different words.

14:23.922 --> 14:26.190
And saying different
words means what?

14:26.191 --> 14:29.260
It means we're not
on the same...

14:29.261 --> 14:30.595
- Diet?
- Page.

14:30.596 --> 14:32.596
Oh, I thought you were
gonna say diet, Ben.

14:32.597 --> 14:36.001
- I don't like your tone.
- And I don't have to answer to you, Ben.

14:36.002 --> 14:38.236
Or to Lara Croft here
for that matter.

14:38.237 --> 14:41.172
Yeah, perhaps not, but we
all work for the president.

14:41.173 --> 14:44.109
Oh, where is the great
and powerful Oz, by the way?

14:44.110 --> 14:47.078
Listen, we all know the White
House would work so much better

14:47.079 --> 14:49.247
if there wasn't a president,
but there is.

14:49.248 --> 14:50.882
So we work around that.

14:50.883 --> 14:52.283
<i>And we do that by sticking</i>

14:52.284 --> 14:54.752
to the same fucking words.

14:54.753 --> 14:57.388
And it's your job
to coordinate that, maestro.

14:57.389 --> 15:01.560
That's right. So from now on, the
words are calculated response.

15:01.561 --> 15:04.796
Calculated?
That sounds so...

15:04.797 --> 15:07.199
- Calculated?
- Pussy-ass, that's what I was gonna say.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.835
<i>You've got to light a fire
under the president's butt.</i>

15:09.836 --> 15:11.870
Let's get some action here.

15:11.871 --> 15:14.673
She fires a gun one time and she
thinks she's Rommel in the desert.

15:14.674 --> 15:16.608
Yeah, let me tell you something.
I'm a good shot.

15:16.609 --> 15:18.710
You know what?
I may even start... you know,

15:18.711 --> 15:21.179
whatever it's called... packing heat.
How about that?

15:21.180 --> 15:23.582
When you do that, I'm gonna
start supporting gun control.

15:23.583 --> 15:26.384
- I have news on the noodles.
- What's he talking about?

15:26.385 --> 15:29.054
- We can move on the hostages.
- Cock-a-noodle-doo.

15:29.055 --> 15:31.757
Oh, my God. I'd kiss you right now,
but I'm never gonna do that.

15:31.758 --> 15:34.927
Earliest we could go in would
be the sixth or the ninth.

15:34.928 --> 15:37.262
We got to go early.
You know POTUS.

15:37.263 --> 15:39.264
If we give him enough time,
he's gonna change his mind.

15:39.265 --> 15:41.400
He's gonna
procrasterbate forever.

15:41.401 --> 15:43.535
- Madam Vice President?
- Huh? Yeah.

15:43.536 --> 15:46.138
Um, just give me one second.

15:46.139 --> 15:47.973
One second.

15:51.178 --> 15:53.279
Amy, call the office.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.748
- Office of the Vice President.
- This is the vice president.

15:55.749 --> 15:58.318
- Yes, it is.
- No, no, this is the vice president.

15:58.319 --> 16:00.820
<i>- Oh, okay. I'm sorry, ma'am.
- It's fine.</i>

16:00.821 --> 16:03.122
Look into my calendar and
tell me if there is anything

16:03.123 --> 16:05.625
on the sixth that is immovable.

16:05.626 --> 16:07.527
Uh, no, ma'am,
it all looks moveable.

16:07.528 --> 16:10.697
The only thing that can't move is Sue's
second hearing appearance on the sixth.

16:10.698 --> 16:13.300
<i>- Oh, that's on the sixth?
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

16:13.301 --> 16:16.804
Set your DVR.
I'm thinking of... okay, you hung up.

16:16.805 --> 16:20.674
Well, gentlemen,
the sixth it's gonna be.

16:20.675 --> 16:22.843
Let's bring these kids home
as soon as possible.

16:22.844 --> 16:23.801
So we're all agreed?

16:23.834 --> 16:26.128
The sixth, it's gonna be a bad day
for the bad guys.

16:26.163 --> 16:28.082
Let's go find POTUS.

16:35.623 --> 16:37.991
Now you went with the sixth
because it's before the ninth?

16:37.992 --> 16:40.094
- Yeah, of course.
- And Sue's return to the committee

16:40.095 --> 16:42.462
- has nothing to do with it?
- You know what I'm interested in?

16:42.463 --> 16:46.033
Getting innocent Americans
home safe and sound, right?

16:49.404 --> 16:51.272
Move everything off
of the sixth for me.

16:51.273 --> 16:53.073
- You can clear that.
- Absolutely, ma'am.

16:53.074 --> 16:55.442
The only thing I need to move is
the senator swearing-in ceremony,

16:55.443 --> 16:57.211
so we're good.

17:01.483 --> 17:03.150
What?

17:03.151 --> 17:05.118
The senator
swearing-in ceremony.

17:06.521 --> 17:08.656
You said that
everything was moveable.

17:08.656 --> 17:10.525
And that's not moveable.

17:10.526 --> 17:13.528
That's immoveable.

17:13.529 --> 17:15.364
Surely nothing is immoveable.

17:15.365 --> 17:18.768
Amy, this is like explaining
gravity to a chicken.

17:18.769 --> 17:21.636
The senator swearing-in
ceremony is set in stone.

17:21.637 --> 17:23.038
She's the president
of the Senate.

17:23.039 --> 17:24.906
She swears in
all newly elected senators.

17:24.906 --> 17:27.108
Right? You get that?
You understand it?

17:27.108 --> 17:29.277
- Do you need to Google it?
- No, ma'am, I understand.

17:29.278 --> 17:31.146
I don't think
you do understand.

17:31.147 --> 17:32.480
Because you are grinning.
Why are you grinning?

17:32.481 --> 17:34.048
- I'm not grinning.
- You are grinning.

17:34.049 --> 17:37.885
You have made a fuckup
the size of France

17:37.886 --> 17:40.688
and you are fucking
grinning about it.

17:40.689 --> 17:42.756
I'm trying not to.
I'm not sure why my face is doing this.

17:42.757 --> 17:45.092
- Oh, damn it.
- Okay.

17:47.228 --> 17:48.729
I don't know what's going on,

17:48.730 --> 17:51.899
but she didn't mean
what she just said, okay?

17:51.900 --> 17:54.468
Okay.
Ma'am, is there anything...

17:54.469 --> 17:57.505
- Classified!
- Oh, my God!

17:57.506 --> 17:59.573
I pushed for the sixth, right?

17:59.574 --> 18:02.343
I got my date.
This is my date, Amy.

18:02.344 --> 18:04.645
This is my hostage
rescue mission.

18:04.646 --> 18:07.114
The most important
thing on the day

18:07.115 --> 18:09.583
is we can't look suspicious
in our movements.

18:09.584 --> 18:13.153
Yeah, I know that.
I know how to act normal, okay?

18:13.154 --> 18:16.123
I'll be normal.
It's gonna be great.

18:19.193 --> 18:21.161
I can't believe
I'm in this position.

18:21.162 --> 18:24.597
This is all Cliff's fault,
that grinning fucking Ewok.

18:24.598 --> 18:25.899
They're all
in the situation room.

18:25.900 --> 18:28.301
I'm stuck here swearing in
a shitload of senators.

18:28.302 --> 18:30.003
Well, the virtual sit room
is right back there

18:30.004 --> 18:31.804
and we've got a secure
video teleconference

18:31.805 --> 18:33.573
- in the situation room, so...
- Oh, great.

18:33.574 --> 18:36.309
My secure video
teleconference with history.

18:36.310 --> 18:38.711
Okay, ma'am, you got
33 senators to get through.

18:38.712 --> 18:42.115
Oh, boy. Well, I feel like that porn
star who had to do 200 men in one day.

18:42.116 --> 18:44.283
At least she got
to lie down, right?

18:47.154 --> 18:49.356
Well, let's bring
this beautiful family in.

18:49.357 --> 18:52.292
Oh, look at this.
You all have good blood.

18:52.293 --> 18:54.428
What's up?
I can see it. It's right here.

18:54.429 --> 18:57.698
This isn't a POTUS thing.
Why is scrotus here?

18:57.699 --> 18:59.233
Think of me
as a cheerleader, Mike.

18:59.234 --> 19:01.368
Oh, God.
I'm imagining you

19:01.369 --> 19:03.337
in a bathtub
full of rose petals.

19:03.338 --> 19:05.939
Thank you. Off you go.
Brian, you're up.

19:05.940 --> 19:07.574
- Come, come.
- Madam Vice President.

19:07.575 --> 19:09.143
- Congratulations.
- What an honor.

19:09.144 --> 19:10.377
It's so good to see you.

19:10.378 --> 19:13.847
I want to know how all
your filmmaking is going.

19:13.848 --> 19:15.082
- Beg pardon?
- And so on.

19:15.083 --> 19:17.618
- Beg pardon?
- Your fishing.

19:17.619 --> 19:20.421
Oh, yeah. It's good.
I'm still hunting for that big one.

19:20.422 --> 19:23.758
Well, that's all we want.
We all want the big one, don't we?

19:23.759 --> 19:27.028
- Did she just make an innuendo?
- Yep. Yep.

19:27.029 --> 19:29.664
That I will bear true faith...

19:29.665 --> 19:32.300
and allegiance to the same.
That I take this obligation

19:32.301 --> 19:35.970
freely without any mental
reservation or purpose of evasion

19:35.971 --> 19:38.940
and that I will well
and faithfully discharge

19:38.941 --> 19:42.843
the duties of the office of which I
am about to enter, so help me Brian.

19:42.844 --> 19:45.045
- Yes.
- Uh, I am Brian.

19:45.046 --> 19:47.114
- I know.
- I think you mean, "So help you God."

19:47.115 --> 19:48.615
Yes, yes.
Oh, so help you God.

19:48.616 --> 19:50.249
- So help me God.
- Me, God, yes.

19:50.250 --> 19:53.052
Oh, my God.
Okay, let's get the family in here.

19:53.053 --> 19:54.521
What's going on?

19:54.522 --> 19:56.789
It's just a blip.
She's gonna be fine.

19:56.790 --> 19:58.491
- I'm Ruby.
- Oh, Ruby.

19:58.492 --> 20:01.227
Oh, I wish that was
my cousin's name.

20:01.228 --> 20:03.697
This is the worst small talk
I've ever heard.

20:03.698 --> 20:05.899
And I'm including mine in that
and mine is horrible.

20:05.900 --> 20:07.768
She's done worse.

20:07.769 --> 20:10.470
I can't think of when,
but she has.

20:10.471 --> 20:12.472
And off you go.
Maryanne.

20:12.473 --> 20:14.708
What in the living...

20:14.709 --> 20:18.345
Lord of Christ
are you doing here?

20:18.346 --> 20:20.381
- But you are.
- I'm here.

20:20.382 --> 20:21.815
So you had a good New Year's?

20:21.816 --> 20:23.717
Yes, we were skiing in Vermont.

20:23.718 --> 20:26.420
Well, that's how
the cookie crumbles.

20:26.421 --> 20:28.756
Yeah, now let's take a photo.

20:28.757 --> 20:30.291
West Wing. Jonah.

20:30.292 --> 20:32.326
Okay, Philip Dorsey's the last
one, so he's gonna be quick.

20:32.327 --> 20:34.796
His wife just died
and he has no family left.

20:34.797 --> 20:37.632
That's great.
For us, I mean.

20:37.633 --> 20:39.434
- 'Cause we're done.
- Okay.

20:39.435 --> 20:42.036
Amy, it's time o'clock.

20:42.037 --> 20:46.074
- What's time o'clock?
- Time o'clock.

20:46.075 --> 20:49.143
This is... I can't
take this anymore.

20:49.144 --> 20:51.446
And so won't you give
my love to Patty?

20:51.447 --> 20:53.515
- She passed away.
- Yes. Yes.

20:53.516 --> 20:56.184
Excuse me, ma'am.
It is time o'clock.

20:58.320 --> 21:00.822
All right, let's get
swearing, Philip.

21:00.823 --> 21:03.190
I do solemnly swear...

21:03.191 --> 21:05.292
that I will support and defend

21:05.293 --> 21:08.695
the Constitution
of the United States

21:08.696 --> 21:13.634
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

21:13.635 --> 21:15.702
That I will bear true faith...

21:15.703 --> 21:18.938
- Maybe she's pregnant again.
- Oh, God.

21:18.939 --> 21:21.174
Or she's menopausal.

21:21.175 --> 21:25.179
Oh, God, she's gonna want that
testosterone gel. I'm out of here.

21:25.180 --> 21:28.049
- ...so help me God.
- ...so help me God.

21:28.050 --> 21:30.752
So help me God.

21:30.753 --> 21:33.622
Uh, I have to move on, Philip.

21:33.623 --> 21:36.092
They all leave me eventually.

21:36.093 --> 21:38.627
Something's up. Something's up.
What's going on?

21:46.369 --> 21:48.737
- Ma'am. Ma'am. Right here.
- Oh, yeah.

21:48.738 --> 21:50.672
- Ma'am, I've got...
- No, you're not needed here, Gary.

21:50.673 --> 21:52.240
- This is man's work.
- Ma'am, should I...

21:52.241 --> 21:53.908
Same goes
for you, Dan. No.

21:53.909 --> 21:55.977
- Let's black out till we drop.
- Sorry, fellas.

21:55.978 --> 21:58.045
I'll just be closing
this door right now.

21:59.881 --> 22:02.950
Wait a minute. Jonah's going in?

22:02.951 --> 22:05.019
- Say hi to history, ma'am.
- Oh, God.

22:05.020 --> 22:08.223
The men get the situation room,
I get the shituation room?

22:08.224 --> 22:10.492
- Ma'am, the comms should be live now.
- Oh.

22:10.493 --> 22:12.060
Hi, gentlemen.

22:12.061 --> 22:13.528
I hope you heard that joke.

22:13.529 --> 22:16.198
That was meant
for you to hear it.

22:16.199 --> 22:18.334
Madam Vice President,
this is General Mercer.

22:18.335 --> 22:21.404
This is so awesome.
I'll bet you camera three gets a kill.

22:21.405 --> 22:22.905
General, Mr. President.

22:22.906 --> 22:25.241
Operation Good Shepherd
is proceeding well, ma'am.

22:25.242 --> 22:27.710
We are looking at
live feeds from cams

22:27.711 --> 22:30.380
aboard the Black Hawks
and we are about to go in.

22:30.381 --> 22:32.148
- Good luck, gentlemen.
- Ma'am.

22:32.149 --> 22:35.718
When the guns go off, they
will be loud, Madam Vice President,

22:35.719 --> 22:37.453
so no swearing.

22:37.454 --> 22:39.922
George, comments like that

22:39.923 --> 22:41.524
are incredibly inappropriate

22:41.525 --> 22:43.359
when people's lives
are at stake.

22:43.360 --> 22:44.860
I've got to
get a refill here.

22:44.861 --> 22:47.029
Old jumbo needs a refill.
Excuse me.

22:47.030 --> 22:48.964
- It's a good photo, ma'am.
- Jonah, there are more important things

22:48.965 --> 22:50.967
going on in the world
right now.

22:50.968 --> 22:53.736
Oh, yeah.
Huh.

22:53.737 --> 22:55.705
Acquisition is confirmed.

22:55.706 --> 22:57.440
<i>The eggs are back
in the basket!</i>

22:57.441 --> 22:59.943
Yeah!
Eggs-shak-a-laka!

22:59.944 --> 23:02.045
In your fucking face, eggs.

23:02.046 --> 23:04.615
What? The hostages?
We got 'em?

23:04.616 --> 23:06.917
Yeah!

23:06.918 --> 23:09.219
Legacy marker.
Yeah!

23:09.220 --> 23:10.921
Gary. Gary.

23:10.922 --> 23:14.157
So Sue's return to the hearing's
wiped off the news map.

23:14.158 --> 23:16.059
That's the last thing on
anyone's mind today. Come on.

23:16.060 --> 23:18.362
<i>Of course.
Of course.</i>

23:18.363 --> 23:21.198
Last year's expenditure
on office supplies

23:21.199 --> 23:24.501
was held at the exact same level
as the previous year.

23:24.502 --> 23:27.638
Which means
that the total sum...

23:27.639 --> 23:30.940
Seems like you're
no longer news, Miss Wilson.

23:30.941 --> 23:33.343
Your 15 minutes might be up.

23:33.344 --> 23:35.144
Ashes to ashes,

23:35.145 --> 23:37.480
robust to dust.

23:40.984 --> 23:43.386
Oh, hey, Sue.
How was the sequel?

23:43.387 --> 23:44.888
Short.

23:44.889 --> 23:47.358
Pumped and dumped
by the fame monster, huh?

23:47.359 --> 23:49.827
Oh, I got the full mission
eval from the NSC.

23:49.828 --> 23:51.195
- Let's speak to the veep.
- Let's go.

23:51.196 --> 23:53.264
Yep?

23:53.265 --> 23:55.400
- Ma'am.
- Congratulations, ma'am.

23:55.401 --> 23:56.735
Thank you, Mr. Ryan.

23:56.736 --> 23:59.605
Operation Good Shepherd...
total success.

23:59.606 --> 24:01.773
Yeah!
Semper fucking fee.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.708
- Fi.
- Fi. Fi, right.

24:03.709 --> 24:05.777
All hostages
recovered unharmed.

24:05.778 --> 24:08.580
- Only one injury.
- Detail on that injury?

24:08.581 --> 24:10.915
A Marine sergeant,
2nd recon battalion,

24:10.916 --> 24:12.984
stray ordnance, he lost a leg.

24:12.985 --> 24:15.120
Uh... wait, wait.

24:15.121 --> 24:18.623
You mean one of our
Marines lost a leg?

24:18.624 --> 24:20.692
Yes, ma'am.
His left leg, ma'am.

24:20.693 --> 24:22.994
Um...

24:22.995 --> 24:24.629
the entire leg?

24:24.630 --> 24:27.032
I believe he lost
from above the knee.

24:27.033 --> 24:30.568
Oh, so they were able to...

24:30.569 --> 24:33.571
just salvage his foot?

24:33.572 --> 24:35.707
No, I believe he lost
from above...

24:35.708 --> 24:37.942
he basically doesn't have a
leg from above the knee down.

24:40.112 --> 24:42.079
Was he part of the operation?

24:42.080 --> 24:45.249
Yes. He was actually due to
be rotated out on the eighth.

24:45.250 --> 24:47.251
Oh, on the eighth.

24:47.252 --> 24:49.486
Huh. Okay.

24:49.487 --> 24:51.188
Is he...

24:51.189 --> 24:53.156
ahem, is he in a lot of pain?

24:53.157 --> 24:54.457
- Oh, no, ma'am.
- Oh, good.

24:54.458 --> 24:56.159
No, he's in an induced coma.

24:56.160 --> 24:59.195
But I suppose
when he wakes up...

25:02.834 --> 25:04.668
I just need to get some air.
Excuse me.

25:04.669 --> 25:06.971
- Congratulations again, ma'am.
- Thanks a million.

25:10.509 --> 25:13.812
- Congratulations, ma'am.
- Thank you.

25:13.813 --> 25:17.082
- I lost a man his leg, Mike.
- So good. So good.

25:17.083 --> 25:20.085
No, no, no.
I lost a man his leg, Mike.

25:20.987 --> 25:23.422
Thanks.
Thanks, guys.

25:25.057 --> 25:26.524
Thank you.

25:26.525 --> 25:30.228
Ma'am, I just want to say
consummate performance.

25:30.229 --> 25:31.830
Not only did you rescue
the hostages,

25:31.831 --> 25:34.065
but you annihilated Sue.

25:34.066 --> 25:37.135
You picked the operation date to
blow her appearance off the map.

25:37.136 --> 25:39.404
I mean, genius play, ma'am.
Genius.

25:39.405 --> 25:41.773
I call that overshadowboxing.

25:41.774 --> 25:43.541
You know what, Dan?

25:43.542 --> 25:46.845
The problem with being so close
to somebody's ear all the time

25:46.846 --> 25:50.115
is that you begin to think that
you can see inside their head,

25:50.116 --> 25:52.718
but you can't, Dan.
You can't.

25:52.719 --> 25:56.323
- Do you understand that?
- Understood, ma'am.

25:56.324 --> 25:58.225
- Hey, ma'am.
- Yes?

25:58.226 --> 26:00.627
Can I get you a cinnamon mocha
or something?

26:00.628 --> 26:02.797
Yeah, let me get that for you.

26:04.332 --> 26:06.533
End of an era, buddy.

26:06.534 --> 26:08.769
End of an era.

26:12.474 --> 26:14.208
I lost a man his leg.

26:14.209 --> 26:16.010
Please stop saying that, ma'am.

26:16.011 --> 26:17.845
He'll bounce back.
I got a feeling.

26:17.846 --> 26:19.914
Ma'am, the vice president
sometimes has to do

26:19.915 --> 26:21.816
bad things to make
good things happen.

26:21.817 --> 26:24.218
The leg is just
the price of admission

26:24.219 --> 26:25.953
to the place you wanted to be.

26:25.954 --> 26:28.423
Well, maybe we could
invite him to the White House.

26:28.424 --> 26:31.293
You know, once he's
back up on his...

26:31.294 --> 26:34.663
Sure, we'll roll out the ramps.

26:37.467 --> 26:40.702
Ma'am, some of the prosthetic
legs they have these days

26:40.703 --> 26:42.204
are as good as real legs.

26:42.205 --> 26:44.506
I guarantee you they're
better than my shitty legs.

26:44.507 --> 26:48.277
I hate my legs.
In fact, if I had the choice...

26:49.846 --> 26:52.214
Huh?

26:52.215 --> 26:55.016
Never mind.
I'm gonna go.

26:56.085 --> 26:58.586
Hey, ma'am.
How would you like

26:58.587 --> 27:01.889
a nice little almond croissant?

27:01.890 --> 27:03.458
Oh, yeah.
I would love that.

27:03.459 --> 27:05.193
Okay. Okay.

27:05.194 --> 27:07.128
Can you make it a big one

27:07.129 --> 27:09.764
so you can stuff me
inside of it

27:09.765 --> 27:10.965
and smuggle me out of here?

27:10.966 --> 27:12.934
Of course I can.

27:12.935 --> 27:16.003
And there might be a little
raspberry surprise in them.

27:16.004 --> 27:19.206
Okay.
Thank you.

27:19.207 --> 27:21.142
My pleasure.
