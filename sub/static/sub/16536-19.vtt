WEBVTT

00:01.252 --> 00:02.711
<i>Previously on "Designated Survivor"...</i>

00:02.836 --> 00:05.381
I would like my daughter to see a woman
become vice president.

00:05.506 --> 00:06.382
Thank you, sir.

00:06.507 --> 00:07.466
The House Ethics Committee,

00:07.591 --> 00:10.052
they are opening an investigation
into the Speaker.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.220
My dad was a great president.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.597
Tyler, I am sorry
for your incredible loss.

00:13.723 --> 00:17.059
Lozano is alive, sir.
The man the FBI killed was a decoy.

00:17.184 --> 00:20.813
Jay Whitaker, Homeland Security Adviser.
Lozano was a total soldier.

00:20.938 --> 00:22.648
I'm just glad
we caught the son of a bitch.

00:22.773 --> 00:23.649
Me too.

00:23.774 --> 00:25.317
We've known that someone
in the White House

00:25.443 --> 00:28.612
made Kirkman designated survivor.
This person may still be active.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.782
- Hey, Jason. I need your help.
<i>- What do you need?</i>

00:31.907 --> 00:33.034
Patrick Lloyd.

00:35.619 --> 00:37.163
- <i>How'd it go?</i>
- Clockwork.

00:37.288 --> 00:38.289
We're back on track.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.682
I'm glad we had a chance
to dig in on this.

01:38.808 --> 01:40.476
Me, too.
If we can expedite TSA screenings

01:40.601 --> 01:42.728
without sacrificing security,
it's money well-spent.

01:42.853 --> 01:45.356
And the president is all about
making people's lives easier.

01:45.481 --> 01:48.984
Perhaps we can put this on his radar
after the NATO summit?

01:49.110 --> 01:50.694
In the meantime, you'll get me that data?

01:50.820 --> 01:52.988
- Consider it done.
- Great.

02:36.866 --> 02:40.077
So, here's something I didn't know
when I came to the White House.

02:40.202 --> 02:42.705
George Washington ran
America's first spy ring

02:42.830 --> 02:44.790
during the Revolutionary War.

02:44.915 --> 02:48.252
His agents relayed
British troop movements.

02:48.377 --> 02:50.713
And they didn't even have cellphones.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.883
He doesn't look very happy.

02:54.008 --> 02:57.136
Well, you probably wouldn't want
to smile either if you had wooden teeth.

02:57.261 --> 02:58.888
Mr. President!

02:59.013 --> 03:01.724
I heard that we had some very special
guests here in the White House today.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.393
Including
President Richmond's son.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.605
- Tyler, really good to see you again.
- Same here, Mr. President.

03:07.730 --> 03:10.441
Allow me to introduce
the Student Orchestra

03:10.566 --> 03:12.985
of Robert Richmond High School
in New Orleans.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.821
It is an honor to meet all of you,
and I heard a rumor

03:15.946 --> 03:17.990
that we're gonna get to hear you perform
later this afternoon.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.492
- I heard that rumor, too.
- Can't wait to hear it.

03:20.618 --> 03:23.204
And if there's anything you need,
please don't hesitate to ask.

03:24.788 --> 03:26.874
- Yes?
- Can I take a picture with you?

03:27.374 --> 03:28.751
It would be my pleasure. Come on.

03:34.423 --> 03:37.635
- Thank you for doing this, Mr. President.
- Are you kidding?

03:37.760 --> 03:39.637
With Leo and Penny up in Camp David,

03:39.762 --> 03:43.182
well, it's nice to have young people
in the White House again.

03:43.307 --> 03:46.310
It's great to see you sharing your passion
for music with these students.

03:46.435 --> 03:48.270
Oh, well, I can't take credit.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.314
This group is actually part
of a national program

03:50.439 --> 03:53.359
- that funds the arts in public schools.
- Oh, that's wonderful.

03:53.484 --> 03:57.655
And, unfortunately, it, um,
might all come to an end.

03:58.405 --> 04:01.784
You see, when the funding was approved,
Congress put in a sunset clause,

04:01.909 --> 04:04.286
so the grant has to be renewed
every five years.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.538
- When does it expire?
- Next month.

04:06.664 --> 04:07.623
Oh...

04:07.748 --> 04:11.293
So, this might be the end
of playing music for a lot of these kids,

04:11.418 --> 04:14.171
and, you know, most of their families
can't afford private lessons.

04:14.296 --> 04:15.881
Mine couldn't either.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.384
I played trumpet
in my elementary school band.

04:18.509 --> 04:21.136
- Oh, I didn't know you played.
- Well, I wouldn't exactly call it playing.

04:21.262 --> 04:24.139
In fact, it was pretty awful. But
it was the experience that mattered.

04:24.265 --> 04:27.142
That... I couldn't agree more.
Music shaped my whole life.

04:27.268 --> 04:29.061
Leo's all about it, too.

04:29.186 --> 04:32.815
But I have to admit,
I don't think I can get into dubstep.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.316
Hey, you never know.

04:34.441 --> 04:37.861
My dad introduced me to Brahms,
I got him hooked on Radiohead.

04:38.195 --> 04:39.905
I promise you.
I will look into the grant.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.074
Thank you, sir.
I know this is small stuff

04:42.199 --> 04:44.201
compared to everything else
you've got going on--

04:44.326 --> 04:45.577
No, no, it's not small stuff.

04:45.703 --> 04:47.329
I think every student
in this country

04:47.454 --> 04:49.873
should have access to the arts
for their education.

04:49.999 --> 04:51.542
It'll be an honor to help.

04:51.667 --> 04:54.044
- I'll see you at the concert?
- I can't wait.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.674
I went through all of her files. Most of
them have to do with Browning Reed.

04:59.466 --> 05:02.219
Maybe she's out in the field
and had to go radio silent.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.471
Yeah, maybe.

05:05.681 --> 05:09.935
Look, you know, I know Wells isn't
exactly by-the-book, right?

05:10.060 --> 05:12.396
But, if she was working something,
she would've let me know.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.023
What about Jason Atwood?

05:14.148 --> 05:16.233
She did bring him
to North Dakota with her, right?

05:16.358 --> 05:17.693
- Maybe he's talked to her.
- Already tried.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.111
He doesn't know anything.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.822
Besides, Hannah told me
she sidelined him anyway.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.741
Where's she staying?

05:36.503 --> 05:37.755
This is her.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.521
Let's check her room.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.616
Excuse me, ma'am?

06:06.283 --> 06:08.952
Secret Service.
Would you open this door, please?

06:23.926 --> 06:25.302
Anything?

06:26.053 --> 06:27.054
No.

06:28.764 --> 06:29.973
She's gone.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.142
Let's check
the security cameras.

06:34.103 --> 06:35.020
Sorry.

06:35.145 --> 06:36.438
Hey, eyes on the road!

06:36.563 --> 06:38.857
Sorry, Hookstraten's Ethics Committee
hearing's about to start.

06:38.982 --> 06:42.152
Well, at least I know what the press is
gonna ask me about in today's briefing.

06:42.277 --> 06:44.863
Everybody loves an ethics scandal,
especially given the V.P. rumors.

06:44.988 --> 06:47.449
The V.P. rumors are just that, Seth.
Rumors.

06:47.574 --> 06:50.035
This is Washington. Things have
a tricky way of becoming reality.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.662
Let's just see
how this hearing goes.

06:51.787 --> 06:53.205
Hey! You didn't say anything
about my haircut.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.541
- Yeah, it looks good.
- You didn't even notice.

06:55.666 --> 06:59.711
I mean, it looks the same?
It always looks great. What is... What?

06:59.837 --> 07:01.505
I got it for the trip.

07:01.630 --> 07:04.508
Wow, I didn't realize you were
so excited for a NATO summit.

07:04.633 --> 07:07.886
No, not for NATO. I figure I'll be taking
a lot of pictures on Air Force One.

07:08.011 --> 07:10.848
Oh. Um, you've been on a...
a plane before, right?

07:10.973 --> 07:12.307
Ooh, not this one.

07:13.976 --> 07:15.477
Oh, my God.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.481
What my colleagues and I
are here to determine is whether

07:19.606 --> 07:22.651
or not there was any quid pro quo
involved between your trip to Turkey

07:22.776 --> 07:27.239
and your subsequent co-sponsorship
of the military aid bill to that country.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.408
I appreciate your candor,
Congresswoman,

07:29.533 --> 07:33.120
so I can categorically deny that there
was any connection between the two events.

07:34.037 --> 07:36.915
The trip was about agricultural methods.
Period.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.084
Did anyone from the Turkish
military or government

07:39.209 --> 07:43.088
contact you during your time in Turkey
to discuss military aid of any nature?

07:43.213 --> 07:44.173
No, they did not.

07:44.298 --> 07:48.010
So, it's just a coincidence that everyone
who went on that trip with you

07:48.135 --> 07:51.513
later voted in favor
of the military aid package?

07:51.972 --> 07:55.726
Congressman Saldua,
279 other members of Congress

07:55.851 --> 07:58.520
also supported that bill, sir.

07:59.646 --> 08:03.442
And, by your question,
you are not only impugning my integrity

08:03.567 --> 08:08.238
but also that of my colleagues who are
no longer here to defend themselves.

08:08.655 --> 08:11.700
That wasn't my intent, Madam Speaker.

08:13.243 --> 08:14.328
If I may?

08:15.245 --> 08:17.998
All of you are new to Congress,

08:18.665 --> 08:21.210
but one thing we have in common

08:21.335 --> 08:24.713
is the oath we took
to uphold the Constitution.

08:25.881 --> 08:29.259
I've always done my best
to live up to that oath.

08:30.677 --> 08:34.389
There may be little hard evidence here
for you to investigate,

08:34.515 --> 08:38.684
but there is a lifetime of public service
to consider.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.270
And that's what's at stake here.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.025
And that's also my best defense;

08:46.276 --> 08:49.696
my record and my reputation.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.616
When it comes time to vote...

08:54.952 --> 08:56.912
...I hope you will vote on that.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.919
Of course they only have
one working camera.

09:06.797 --> 09:08.215
There's Wells.

09:12.094 --> 09:13.262
The hell?

09:16.640 --> 09:17.724
Damn it.

09:24.940 --> 09:27.317
- Mr. President.
- You wanted to see me?

09:29.319 --> 09:31.363
- It's about Agent Wells, sir.
- What about her?

09:31.488 --> 09:32.573
She's been kidnapped.

09:35.158 --> 09:37.202
Kidnapped? How?

09:37.327 --> 09:39.204
Last night, in the parking lot
of her motel,

09:39.329 --> 09:41.707
- a van pulled up and they grabbed her.
- Who?

09:41.832 --> 09:43.625
- We don't know, sir.
- We traced the vehicle,

09:43.750 --> 09:46.044
- but the plates came back stolen.
- I want every agency on this.

09:46.169 --> 09:48.672
- It's already done.
- What was she closing in on?

09:48.797 --> 09:52.759
She was looking into Browning Reed,
a former military contractor.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.887
Agent Wells is convinced
that the ex-C.E.O. Patrick Lloyd's

09:56.013 --> 09:58.390
- involved with the conspiracy.
- Did she have any evidence?

09:58.515 --> 10:00.183
Right now, it's just a working theory.

10:00.309 --> 10:03.729
We don't have anything directly tying
him to the bombing, yet. No smoking gun.

10:03.854 --> 10:05.856
But we've got eyes on him 24/7.

10:05.981 --> 10:09.067
Lloyd lives in Virginia, but lately
he's been traveling the country,

10:09.192 --> 10:10.485
building up his political profile.

10:10.611 --> 10:13.780
This afternoon, he's speaking
to an alt-right gathering downtown.

10:14.114 --> 10:17.117
Use every resource available to you,
but find Agent Wells.

10:17.534 --> 10:18.994
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

10:33.717 --> 10:36.261
Some people
still buy this stuff, huh?

10:36.386 --> 10:39.222
What can I say?
Hipsters love analog.

10:40.015 --> 10:42.267
I got a shotgun mic and receiver.

10:42.392 --> 10:43.935
Range of 1,000 yards.

10:44.061 --> 10:45.395
Hm?

10:47.064 --> 10:49.608
The nano tracker inside;

10:49.733 --> 10:51.401
negligible weight difference.

10:52.402 --> 10:55.155
Tracking radius of 10 miles.

10:56.073 --> 10:56.990
Perfect.

10:58.075 --> 11:00.577
So, what happened?
Bureau run out of toys?

11:01.411 --> 11:03.038
Thank you for the quick turnaround.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.247
I owe you.

11:07.668 --> 11:09.920
Mr. President, I have something
I think you're going to want to hear.

11:10.045 --> 11:12.130
- It's about the NATO summit.
- I'm all ears.

11:12.255 --> 11:14.466
I just came from meeting
the new French ambassador,

11:14.591 --> 11:18.053
and the first thing he wanted
to talk about was nukes.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.222
What about them?

11:20.347 --> 11:24.101
Liberals in France have been railing
against nuclear escalation for decades.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.312
But now, even the conservatives
are beginning to wonder

11:27.437 --> 11:30.691
why they're spending so much damn money
just to maintain weapons in Europe.

11:31.441 --> 11:34.277
Ambassador Bouvar broadly hinted

11:34.403 --> 11:37.155
that it's an opening to de-escalate, Tom.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.951
Well, fine, but unless I'm missing
something, if we reduce our arsenal,

11:41.076 --> 11:43.495
what stops our adversaries
from taking advantage?

11:43.620 --> 11:44.955
If the West could show Russia

11:45.080 --> 11:46.748
that we were serious
about laying down our weapons,

11:46.873 --> 11:49.501
they might see that it's safe for them
to start laying down theirs.

11:49.626 --> 11:54.256
- And if they don't?
- Well, we'd do it incrementally.

11:54.381 --> 11:58.009
And if there's no reciprocity, we stop.
But, it's a chance.

11:58.135 --> 12:00.929
It's a chance I never got, Mr. President.

12:01.638 --> 12:03.598
It would take more than France
and the United States.

12:03.724 --> 12:06.017
The entire alliance would have
to be on-board.

12:06.143 --> 12:08.311
Absolutely. The details are all in here.

12:09.312 --> 12:12.149
In the meantime, I will need permission
to open any backdoor communication

12:12.274 --> 12:14.860
with the French and a few
of our other NATO partners,

12:14.985 --> 12:17.362
and we'll have to act fast.

12:17.487 --> 12:20.657
This time tomorrow, everyone'll be heading
to Toronto for the summit.

12:24.995 --> 12:27.497
- Let's give it a shot.
- Yes, sir.

12:28.331 --> 12:29.416
Thank you both.

12:38.675 --> 12:41.261
Trenton P.D. called in the plate
15 minutes ago.

12:42.971 --> 12:45.056
- Empty?
- Yeah, top to bottom.

12:45.182 --> 12:47.893
It's not like they're gonna
leave us any breadcrumbs.

12:48.018 --> 12:50.312
- Well it's better than her being in there.
- Yeah.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.522
But if they didn't take her
to kill her...

12:55.942 --> 12:57.360
Then, what do they want with her?

13:19.549 --> 13:20.717
Where's Lozano?

13:21.176 --> 13:22.886
You tell him I want to talk to him!

13:27.182 --> 13:29.226
I understand, sir.
The problem, though,

13:29.351 --> 13:33.438
isn't public support for the issue,
it's the mining and utility companies

13:33.563 --> 13:36.441
- that put up the biggest fight.
- Clean water shouldn't even be a fight.

13:36.566 --> 13:39.736
These companies that you're talking about
need to start working for the future.

13:39.861 --> 13:43.031
You know that business execs
only think about bottom-line costs.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.950
Well, if their only concern is costs,

13:45.075 --> 13:47.452
you should remind them how much
it costs to clean up their mess,

13:47.577 --> 13:49.913
- especially after we start fining them.
- Yes, sir, Mr. President.

13:50.038 --> 13:52.082
Thank you, Brian. Thank you all.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.379
Kimble, please.

14:02.592 --> 14:04.135
So, how did the hearing go?

14:04.261 --> 14:07.472
Honestly, I don't know.
I think I represented myself well.

14:07.597 --> 14:11.059
Aaron thought I did.
But it's a hard room to read.

14:11.935 --> 14:13.645
I'm sure you knocked it out of the park.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.898
But, sir, even if the Ethics Committee
finds no wrongdoing,

14:17.023 --> 14:19.234
the accusation will always be out there.

14:20.110 --> 14:21.444
Kimble...

14:22.779 --> 14:25.031
I said I would stand behind you.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.951
- I meant it.
- Thank you, sir.

14:28.076 --> 14:30.912
In the meantime, I intend
to keep doing my job.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.832
The business of governing doesn't stop,
even for an ethics inquiry.

14:33.957 --> 14:38.003
Speaking of which, I met with President
Richmond's son Tyler this morning.

14:38.128 --> 14:41.006
He was with a group of music students
from a high school in New Orleans

14:41.131 --> 14:42.674
that had just been named
after his father.

14:42.799 --> 14:45.510
Now, he told me
that their music program

14:45.635 --> 14:47.345
was gonna lose their funding.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.264
How familiar are you
with the federal art grants

14:49.389 --> 14:51.308
that make these kind
of programs possible?

14:51.433 --> 14:52.767
I remember that bill.

14:52.893 --> 14:55.520
The sunset clause was added
to get it past

14:55.645 --> 14:57.606
some of my
more conservative colleagues.

14:57.731 --> 15:00.525
How fast do you think we can get Congress
to reauthorize the grant?

15:00.650 --> 15:04.029
I wish I could help you and Tyler
with this, sir, but it has to go through

15:04.154 --> 15:06.364
the Ways and Means Committee,
which is chaired by Owen Saldua,

15:06.489 --> 15:08.491
who just happens to be
leading the charge against me

15:08.617 --> 15:10.994
- in the Ethics Committee.
- You're kidding me.

15:11.119 --> 15:12.662
Unfortunately, no.

15:12.787 --> 15:16.875
I don't have any leverage
with him right now. But you might.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.670
Saldua's an Independent.
He might just listen to you.

15:21.504 --> 15:23.089
Okay, I'll reach out to him.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.969
Thanks again, Mrs. Kirkman,
for showing us around today.

15:28.094 --> 15:32.390
No, no, please, call me Alex.
Uh, it was great, and it made me happy.

15:32.515 --> 15:36.061
Those kids, they're so passionate
about what they're doing,

15:36.186 --> 15:37.479
and they adore you.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.981
Oh, well, I'm just lucky
they let me hang around.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.983
Oh, come on.
Don't sell yourself short.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.194
I could tell you have a way with them.

15:44.319 --> 15:47.113
- Well, it's... it's been good for me, too.
- Mm-hmm.

15:47.864 --> 15:48.949
How are you doing?

15:50.867 --> 15:53.745
The kids are good... really.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.206
Um, Camp David's been a change.

15:57.332 --> 16:00.585
Not so much for Penny because, you know,
she sees everything as an adventure...

16:00.710 --> 16:03.380
...but Leo, I-I think
he thinks we're punishing him.

16:03.505 --> 16:07.175
Yeah. Well, I know how hard it can be,

16:07.300 --> 16:11.721
you know, being a part of all this.
And you didn't even sign up for it.

16:11.846 --> 16:16.226
Well, neither did you,
but you seemed to cope really well.

16:16.351 --> 16:17.352
Hm.

16:19.354 --> 16:22.357
I-I guess it's...
it's not easy for anyone, right?

16:23.358 --> 16:28.238
I used to want my kids
to have extraordinary lives.

16:28.363 --> 16:32.909
And now I-I just... I just want
some semblance of ordinary, you know.

16:34.911 --> 16:38.164
From, um, my experience...

16:39.165 --> 16:41.751
kids can bounce back from a lot.

16:42.711 --> 16:45.046
What matters is that you stick together.

16:55.181 --> 16:58.268
Right this way, Mr. Lloyd.
Excuse me. Sorry.

16:58.393 --> 16:59.644
Okay. Thank you.

16:59.769 --> 17:02.480
Place all metal objects in the tray before
stepping through the metal detector.

17:02.605 --> 17:03.815
Okay.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.405
Uh, sir, your lapel pin.

17:11.948 --> 17:14.784
- You're kidding, right?
- It's a very sensitive machine.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.412
- Okay.
- Thank you.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.205
Hi.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.250
Oh, thank you.

17:24.419 --> 17:25.920
Ah, thank you.

17:29.424 --> 17:30.633
Easy like Sunday morning.

17:33.636 --> 17:35.055
Just a little tip.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.308
Thanks.

17:39.726 --> 17:40.810
Want it?

17:41.644 --> 17:43.271
Nah, you can keep it.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.814
Thanks.

17:54.449 --> 17:55.992
Congressman Saldua's here.

17:57.827 --> 18:00.330
Congressman, welcome to the White House.

18:00.455 --> 18:02.540
- Please.
- Thank you, sir. It's an honor.

18:02.665 --> 18:04.667
I was hoping I might get
an invitation soon,

18:04.793 --> 18:08.046
uh, though I am a bit wary
about coming in today,

18:08.171 --> 18:09.881
given the circumstances.

18:10.006 --> 18:12.342
I'm not here to meddle
in any ongoing investigations,

18:12.467 --> 18:15.345
and I am very sorry that we haven't had
the chance to meet yet.

18:15.470 --> 18:18.890
I'm still trying to find my way
around here, as I'm sure you are.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.517
Every day, Mr. President.

18:20.642 --> 18:22.560
But I'm convinced
we can do some great work.

18:22.685 --> 18:26.189
That's good to hear.
There's a lot of work to do.

18:26.314 --> 18:27.816
Today, I was thinking about education.

18:28.691 --> 18:30.401
I met some high school students
from New Orleans,

18:30.527 --> 18:34.572
part of a music program funded
by the National Endowment for the Arts.

18:34.697 --> 18:37.867
But, unfortunately,
their funding's about to run out.

18:38.868 --> 18:42.872
Arts education is certainly something to
look at as we approach the next budget.

18:42.997 --> 18:44.374
These kids can't wait that long.

18:44.499 --> 18:47.418
Their grant expires next month
unless Congress re-approves it.

18:47.544 --> 18:50.505
So, I was hoping that maybe
we could find a way to fast-track it,

18:50.630 --> 18:51.714
tack it on to something else.

18:51.840 --> 18:56.427
Respectfully, sir, I ran for Congress
to avoid that kind of back-room dealing.

18:56.553 --> 18:59.764
Respectfully, this isn't a back room.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.766
This is the Oval Office
of the White House.

19:01.891 --> 19:04.769
These kind of riders have been part of
the problem in Washington for decades.

19:04.894 --> 19:06.771
I mean, you scratch my back,
I scratch yours.

19:06.896 --> 19:09.774
Congressman, this won't just affect
high school students in New Orleans.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.609
This is a national program.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.903
- The ramifi--
- Look, I love music as much as anyone.

19:14.028 --> 19:17.240
But a lot of folks think we should throw
everything we've got

19:17.365 --> 19:19.951
into science, technology,
engineering, math.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.954
We used to lead the world
in those areas.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.789
Now, we're barely
in the middle of the pack.

19:24.914 --> 19:29.252
I don't think our children should be
forced to choose between art or science.

19:30.336 --> 19:33.131
I'm happy to debate this, Mr. President,

19:33.256 --> 19:36.092
when we put together the next budget.

19:40.096 --> 19:42.932
This is the year of our reckoning.

19:44.184 --> 19:47.604
The rest of the world is catching up
to what we've known,

19:48.354 --> 19:49.480
that for far too long,

19:49.606 --> 19:53.818
government has tried
to hijack our identities,

19:53.943 --> 19:57.238
control our lives,
and brainwash our children.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.949
But no longer.

20:00.283 --> 20:04.287
No longer because we are rising up.

20:04.412 --> 20:05.413
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

20:05.538 --> 20:08.333
This movement is
the future of our nation,

20:08.458 --> 20:13.254
and no... no illegitimate government,
no illegitimate president,

20:13.379 --> 20:15.506
is going to stand in our way.

20:20.970 --> 20:21.971
Dalton.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.932
It's Foerstel. How's Lloyd?

20:24.057 --> 20:26.476
Just wrapping up
his Beer Hall Putsch.

20:26.601 --> 20:28.478
<i>Inspiring. Keep me posted.</i>

20:32.982 --> 20:34.317
Come on, man.
It's my first week.

20:34.442 --> 20:36.027
You're already shaking me down?

20:36.152 --> 20:38.363
Well, what else are cousins for, right?

20:38.488 --> 20:40.990
Come on, I'm not asking for any
state secrets or anything like that.

20:41.115 --> 20:44.160
I just want to know what your take was
on how things went down this morning.

20:44.786 --> 20:46.996
I know Congresswoman Yoshida
was impressed.

20:47.622 --> 20:48.831
Okay?

20:50.166 --> 20:52.168
And Delacroix and Harmon, too.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.630
What, that's it?
We didn't get more support than that?

20:56.172 --> 20:58.633
I mean, they still have
more witnesses to call.

21:00.843 --> 21:03.012
So, you think
it's gonna be a 9-3 against.

21:05.598 --> 21:09.018
- Yeah, all right.
- I mean, I could be wrong.

21:09.644 --> 21:11.062
I'll call you if I hear anything.

21:11.187 --> 21:12.855
Thank you.

21:20.863 --> 21:22.865
9 to 3 against?

21:24.033 --> 21:26.911
It's an estimate, ma'am.
They still have other witnesses to call.

21:27.036 --> 21:31.082
Yeah, bureaucrats who simply confirm
the facts they already know.

21:31.207 --> 21:34.502
I took a trip and there was a bill.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.004
Well, the others can still
change their minds.

21:38.339 --> 21:41.843
- I thought I did better than that.
- No, you did fine, ma'am.

21:41.968 --> 21:44.012
This is a kangaroo court.

21:45.471 --> 21:47.557
They're going to strip me
of my Speakership.

21:47.682 --> 21:50.852
And they can't do that alone. They can
only recommend to the full House.

21:51.227 --> 21:55.690
- You can still fight this.
- With what? The facts won't change.

21:56.232 --> 21:59.277
I gave it my best shot in there today
with the committee.

21:59.402 --> 22:01.779
What makes you think
I'll do any better in the House?

22:01.904 --> 22:04.365
Because it'll give us time
to organize a campaign.

22:04.907 --> 22:07.118
We'll put your profile out there
in the national media;

22:07.243 --> 22:08.911
we'll drag it out as long as we can...

22:10.204 --> 22:12.874
until public opinion
swings the vote in your direction.

22:15.043 --> 22:17.712
You may have just given me
an idea, Aaron.

22:18.504 --> 22:19.505
For what?

22:20.757 --> 22:22.467
A last hurrah.

22:24.427 --> 22:25.803
Thank you for coming today.

22:25.928 --> 22:27.597
Thank you. Thank you.
It's good to see you.

22:27.722 --> 22:28.973
<i>Target on the way out.</i>

22:29.098 --> 22:31.100
On it. Ready to move.

23:32.161 --> 23:34.455
We'll boil the message
down to a handful of talking points,

23:34.580 --> 23:37.041
get those out to some key media outlets
in anticipation of the summit,

23:37.166 --> 23:39.210
and then your speech in Toronto
will build on those.

23:39.335 --> 23:42.171
Less nationalism,
more multinationalism.

23:42.296 --> 23:43.339
Well, that's the gist of it.

23:43.464 --> 23:47.051
And let's be specific about reducing
military hot spots around the globe.

23:47.176 --> 23:48.886
- Build awareness.
- Good idea.

23:49.011 --> 23:50.888
I'll have a draft for you
to read on the plane.

23:51.013 --> 23:52.723
- Thank you.
- Sir, I've reached out to Leg. Affairs

23:52.849 --> 23:54.725
about that arts education grant.

23:54.851 --> 23:56.227
- Any luck?
- They're trying,

23:56.352 --> 23:57.728
but it seems Congressman Saldua

23:57.854 --> 24:00.064
controls the purse strings
in the House pretty tightly.

24:00.189 --> 24:02.233
Most of these new reps don't have
any voting history to speak of,

24:02.358 --> 24:03.693
so we're feeling our way in the dark.

24:03.818 --> 24:05.903
But I did request a list
of every Congressional district

24:06.028 --> 24:07.822
- with at least one school in the program.
- Good.

24:07.947 --> 24:10.324
That might make them think twice,
knowing they're gonna have

24:10.450 --> 24:13.703
to face their constituents if they let
the grant expire. Thank you.

24:13.828 --> 24:15.663
Don't thank me yet.
I'm still working on it.

25:00.082 --> 25:03.127
It really didn't matter
what I said in that hearing, did it?

25:03.252 --> 25:05.713
You know I can't discuss
an ongoing ethics investigation,

25:05.838 --> 25:09.967
- especially not with its subject.
- I also know you want me out, Owen.

25:10.092 --> 25:12.386
I believe the kind of politicking
you represent

25:12.512 --> 25:14.555
should be a thing of the past.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.641
I understand
that's good for messaging,

25:16.766 --> 25:19.769
but what you don't realize
about us old-school politicians

25:19.894 --> 25:21.562
is that we understand procedure.

25:22.438 --> 25:24.148
If this goes to the House,

25:24.273 --> 25:26.901
I could eat up
the next six months at least

25:27.026 --> 25:30.446
with hearings and motions

25:30.571 --> 25:32.698
and subpoenas.

25:33.908 --> 25:35.618
- Is that a threat?
- No.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.371
Quite the opposite, actually.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.457
I'm willing to get out of your way.

25:42.542 --> 25:45.169
- I'm sorry?
- I want what's best for the country.

25:45.294 --> 25:48.256
So, I'll step aside,

25:48.881 --> 25:50.550
resign the Speakership,

25:51.092 --> 25:52.552
and my seat.

25:55.137 --> 25:57.223
I'll admit... I'm surprised.

25:58.140 --> 26:00.059
But I want something from you, Owen.

26:01.269 --> 26:04.188
I want the public arts education funding

26:04.313 --> 26:07.567
reauthorized <i>before</i> I go.

26:11.487 --> 26:14.615
The operation is still viable.
Right now, I'm brooming any connection

26:14.740 --> 26:17.201
between you, Browning Reed,
and the Capitol mission.

26:17.326 --> 26:20.037
Well, then, I want to know why two
federal investigators were on my property.

26:20.162 --> 26:22.164
<i>Don't worry about it. I'm on it.</i>

26:22.957 --> 26:26.794
<i>Soon, there'll be no paper trail
whatsoever, and Agent Wells is contained.</i>

26:27.753 --> 26:29.046
<i>Okay.</i>

26:29.171 --> 26:31.215
Well, what about the, uh...
the press angle?

26:31.340 --> 26:33.509
Everything's on track with Abe Leonard.

26:34.343 --> 26:35.636
He's eaten up everything I've fed him.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.388
He thinks he's another
Woodward and Bernstein.

26:37.513 --> 26:39.724
Well, when are we going to see
something from him, then?

26:39.849 --> 26:41.142
Any day, I expect.

26:41.267 --> 26:44.895
<i>And you're sure that the FBI
has no idea what's coming.</i>

26:45.021 --> 26:46.522
<i>All the agencies are focused</i>

26:46.647 --> 26:48.399
<i>on the three targets
from Brooke's hard drive:</i>

26:48.524 --> 26:50.318
<i>the Golden Gate Bridge,
the Hoover Dam,</i>

26:50.443 --> 26:51.819
and the Statue of Liberty.

26:52.153 --> 26:54.655
- We have operational control.
- Good.

26:55.197 --> 26:56.324
Jay...

26:56.866 --> 26:58.784
we are so close.

26:59.285 --> 27:00.578
We might not have the Presidency,

27:00.703 --> 27:04.457
but you can be damn sure that,
before long, we will have the country.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.738
I've done a multi-agency document search
for any files with the words

28:17.863 --> 28:19.865
"White House" and "Browning Reed"
in them.

28:20.282 --> 28:22.284
All I've managed to find was this.

28:22.785 --> 28:24.620
It's, like, five files.

28:24.745 --> 28:26.914
- How's that possible?
- Someone would've had to physically remove

28:27.039 --> 28:28.791
these documents from the West Wing.

28:30.084 --> 28:33.754
- Well, there's got to be a digital record.
- Still poring through the database.

28:33.879 --> 28:37.341
And it seems since the attack at
the Capitol, references to Browning Reed

28:37.466 --> 28:39.468
have been systematically deleted.

28:40.052 --> 28:41.971
Someone's covering their tracks.

28:43.973 --> 28:46.892
If we find out who deleted these files...

28:47.476 --> 28:49.103
...we find our traitor.

28:50.146 --> 28:52.356
I had a long talk with Tyler Richmond.

28:52.481 --> 28:55.025
There was just this sadness
about him, you know?

28:55.151 --> 28:57.361
He didn't get to know
his dad growing up,

28:57.486 --> 29:00.156
all the politics
and then the White House and...

29:00.656 --> 29:03.534
I felt like he's still
chasing his father.

29:03.659 --> 29:06.787
- I so don't want that for our kids.
- I don't want it either.

29:06.912 --> 29:10.374
I know we're trying to protect them,
but aren't they better off with us...

29:10.499 --> 29:11.834
both of us?

29:11.959 --> 29:13.377
Not yet.

29:13.502 --> 29:14.837
I'm... I'm sorry, but...

29:16.130 --> 29:19.133
Well, me too. Tom...

29:19.258 --> 29:20.301
Yes?

29:21.177 --> 29:24.138
- Sir, Speaker Hookstraten?
- Just give me a second.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.390
- I'll let you get back to your work.
- Alex...

29:26.515 --> 29:28.142
No, we'll talk later.

29:37.318 --> 29:39.028
Kimble, please, have a seat.

29:40.696 --> 29:43.908
- Did you speak with the committee?
- Unofficially.

29:44.033 --> 29:46.577
And I wanted to speak to you
as soon as possible.

29:46.702 --> 29:47.870
What is it?

29:49.163 --> 29:50.790
I've decided to resign.

29:51.540 --> 29:54.710
- The Speakership?
- And my seat.

29:55.544 --> 29:59.548
What? Kimble,
that doesn't make any sense.

30:00.382 --> 30:02.843
The Ethics Committee is
going to vote against me, sir,

30:02.968 --> 30:07.014
recommend to the House
that I be removed as Speaker.

30:07.139 --> 30:10.184
- You have friends in the House.
- Not enough.

30:10.559 --> 30:14.855
For better or worse, I represent
old politics to a new Congress.

30:14.980 --> 30:17.107
And this is the new politics?
This is a purge.

30:17.233 --> 30:21.445
I said I would fight till the end,
and I can see now that this is it.

30:21.570 --> 30:23.781
I came to Washington to serve,

30:23.906 --> 30:27.451
but I can't represent my constituents
the way they deserve.

30:27.576 --> 30:28.702
Kimble, please.

30:28.828 --> 30:30.412
Tell me what I can do.

30:30.996 --> 30:33.415
Nothing. It's out of our hands.

30:34.416 --> 30:38.587
But, I do have a little bit of good news,
at least.

30:39.213 --> 30:41.549
As my last act as Speaker,

30:41.674 --> 30:45.052
the House will refinance
the arts education funding

30:45.177 --> 30:46.720
for Robert Richmond High

30:46.846 --> 30:49.306
and all the other public schools
that depend on it.

30:49.431 --> 30:52.309
How is that even possible?
Saldua said he'd never do it.

30:52.434 --> 30:55.396
Well, every inmate gets a last meal.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.606
I asked for a little bit of pork.

31:00.442 --> 31:03.153
You know, you're the best ally

31:03.279 --> 31:05.781
I could've ever hoped for
in Washington, sir.

31:06.282 --> 31:08.701
It's been an honor serving with you.

31:11.036 --> 31:12.121
No.

31:12.955 --> 31:15.708
- I'm sorry?
- I won't accept this.

31:16.876 --> 31:20.462
I appreciate the gesture, Mr. President,
but we can't take on Congress.

31:21.255 --> 31:23.799
I'm thinking of taking on something else.

31:25.968 --> 31:28.929
No, Mom, only the president gets to wave
when he steps on Air Force One.

31:29.054 --> 31:31.515
I don't get a shout-out.
This is not the Super Bowl.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.267
I... hey, uh, I got to go.

31:34.268 --> 31:36.103
Yes, I'm bringing warm clothing.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.689
- Okay, I love you too, bye.
- Oh, love you, too. Who's that?

31:38.814 --> 31:40.316
Uh, just some NATO prep.

31:40.441 --> 31:43.360
Hey, did you know that they charge you
for the food on Air Force One

31:43.485 --> 31:44.945
whether you actually eat it or not?

31:45.070 --> 31:47.031
Yeah, well, did you know that
complaining about the meals

31:47.156 --> 31:49.491
on Air Force One is the same thing
as telling people

31:49.617 --> 31:51.035
you went to school outside of Boston?

31:51.160 --> 31:53.537
- Cambridge is outside of Boston.
- Oh, my God.

31:53.662 --> 31:55.789
Look, I'm sure you'll ride on the plane
soon enough, right?

31:55.915 --> 31:57.958
Somebody's got to stay here
to hold down the fort.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.210
Oh, well, I hope you enjoy
your in-flight pretzels

32:00.336 --> 32:03.631
because I will be the highest ranking
person in the White House.

32:04.757 --> 32:06.467
That's terrifying.

32:10.346 --> 32:12.973
- Tell me that you found her.
- It's only a matter of time, sir.

32:13.098 --> 32:15.142
- We will find her.
- But, there is a new development.

32:15.267 --> 32:18.562
We think there's a way to identify
the traitor through a computer trace.

32:18.687 --> 32:20.564
It's gonna be pain-staking,
but it will get results.

32:20.689 --> 32:22.983
And in the meantime, sir, we need
to discuss your trip tomorrow.

32:23.108 --> 32:25.986
I don't think it's a good idea for you
to leave the White House right now.

32:26.111 --> 32:28.989
Mike, I understand your concerns,
but I have to go. I'm not pulling out.

32:29.114 --> 32:31.742
Then I insist we increase
your security even more.

32:31.867 --> 32:33.410
Do whatever you think is necessary.

32:33.535 --> 32:36.580
But if we're this close to finding the
traitor, I want you here in Washington.

32:36.705 --> 32:38.415
- Sir, I--
- Wait, no, the president's right.

32:38.540 --> 32:40.834
We're spread way too thin as it is.
There's only four of us

32:40.960 --> 32:43.796
who know the full extent of this,
and three of us are in this room.

32:44.546 --> 32:47.549
Mr. President, your safety is still
my primary directive.

32:47.675 --> 32:51.011
Then you handpick my detail.
If you trust them, I trust them.

32:51.136 --> 32:52.388
But I want you here.

32:53.681 --> 32:55.140
Thank you.

32:55.557 --> 32:56.725
Yes, sir.

33:05.567 --> 33:07.236
I can't reach it.

33:37.057 --> 33:38.600
Thank you.

33:45.107 --> 33:47.651
I was starting to wonder
if you'd stood me up.

33:47.776 --> 33:49.069
Come here.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.784
- What is it?
- Nothing.

33:59.288 --> 34:02.958
- Is it about what I said earlier?
- No. No, I promise.

34:03.625 --> 34:06.962
I just got a lot on my mind.
Come on, let's get ready.

34:07.379 --> 34:10.632
Tom, I'm worried about you.
I can see it in your face,

34:10.757 --> 34:13.177
the toll this job is taking on you.

34:13.302 --> 34:15.596
I mean, I know
you can't tell me everything,

34:15.721 --> 34:17.431
but you can tell me something.

34:18.806 --> 34:21.935
If I can't help you, then what's the point
of me even being here?

34:28.442 --> 34:30.485
I asked someone
to do something for me...

34:32.780 --> 34:34.822
...something very dangerous...

34:38.659 --> 34:40.661
...and it might cost them their life.

34:53.592 --> 34:57.137
When I was in choir in high school,
we were never invited to the White House.

34:57.262 --> 34:58.847
Neither were we.

34:58.972 --> 35:00.724
- You were in choir?
- Magic club.

35:00.849 --> 35:03.685
We never got invited anywhere,
now that I think of it.

35:04.478 --> 35:07.106
- Are you sure you're up for this?
- No, I want to be here.

35:09.483 --> 35:12.736
- Tyler, how are you?
- Mr. President. Mrs. Kirkman.

35:12.861 --> 35:15.739
- How are the kids?
- Eh, they're a little nervous.

35:15.864 --> 35:18.200
This isn't exactly
their high school auditorium.

35:18.325 --> 35:21.995
- Oh, come on. They're gonna be great.
- And they're gonna remember this forever.

35:22.704 --> 35:24.748
I wanted to be the first to tell you.

35:24.873 --> 35:26.917
Congress is gonna reauthorize the grant.

35:27.042 --> 35:28.752
- You serious?
- Yes.

35:28.877 --> 35:32.881
You should thank Kimble Hookstraten.
She's the one who made it happen.

35:37.219 --> 35:40.597
Don't worry, Aaron. It's not about
Congressman Saldua anymore.

35:40.722 --> 35:43.517
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

35:49.314 --> 35:50.440
Thank you.

35:50.566 --> 35:52.526
Thank you, please.

35:53.318 --> 35:54.611
Thank you all for joining us.

35:54.736 --> 35:58.240
I know that you did not come here today
to listen to my voice,

35:58.365 --> 36:00.617
so I will make this
as brief as possible.

36:00.742 --> 36:02.619
The performance
that you are about to hear

36:02.744 --> 36:05.581
will be given by
the student choir and orchestra

36:05.706 --> 36:09.751
of the newly renamed Robert Richmond
High School of New Orleans.

36:15.549 --> 36:19.303
And with them today is Tyler Richmond,
a talented musician himself

36:19.428 --> 36:22.598
and a great advocate
for education in the arts.

36:22.723 --> 36:27.603
Earlier today, Tyler reminded me
that art is the lifeblood of society.

36:27.728 --> 36:30.981
And as we strive to create
a truly comprehensive education

36:31.106 --> 36:35.319
for every student in America,
I realize now more than ever

36:35.444 --> 36:39.823
that we need someone who is capable
and passionate to lead the charge.

36:39.948 --> 36:43.243
Now, I can't think of a better setting

36:43.368 --> 36:46.997
to announce my nominee
for Secretary of Education than this.

36:47.122 --> 36:48.832
So, it is with great pride

36:48.957 --> 36:51.960
that I introduce
Speaker Kimble Hookstraten.

37:00.594 --> 37:02.137
Thank you, Mr. President.

37:02.262 --> 37:04.932
It's been an honor
to work with you in Congress.

37:05.057 --> 37:07.684
And it will be my honor
to fight beside you

37:07.809 --> 37:09.603
for the education of our children.

37:09.978 --> 37:14.483
Future leaders in every field,
this job is about our kids,

37:14.608 --> 37:16.526
and this afternoon is, too.

37:16.652 --> 37:20.197
So, it is also my honor
to welcome the student orchestra

37:20.322 --> 37:22.157
of Robert Richmond High School.

37:28.956 --> 37:32.709

38:39.484 --> 38:40.736
Thank you.

38:41.403 --> 38:42.529
Sir.

38:50.871 --> 38:53.373
- It's my first time on Air Force One.
- Well, here, let me.

38:53.498 --> 38:56.126
- You don't have to do that, sir.
- No, I know how to work these things.

38:56.251 --> 38:57.127
All right.

38:57.252 --> 38:59.963
As a matter of fact, uh,
you might as well just do it right.

39:00.088 --> 39:01.298
Go on up those stairs.

39:01.423 --> 39:02.382
- Here, Tom, take a--
- No.

39:02.507 --> 39:04.551
- ...take a picture with Seth.
- Seth, come on up here!

39:04.676 --> 39:06.428
That's okay, sir.
You don't have to do that.

39:06.553 --> 39:08.805
- Why not? Go ahead.
- Well, uh...

39:08.930 --> 39:11.600
This is, uh... this is just a photo
for my mom, sir.

39:11.725 --> 39:14.102
It's not... not for Instagram
or anything like that.

39:14.561 --> 39:15.562
Wow.

39:16.938 --> 39:18.482
- You ready?
- Hey! Uh, wait.

39:18.607 --> 39:21.401
Uh, can I wave?
My mom would really like that.

39:21.526 --> 39:22.736
Wave away.

39:24.112 --> 39:26.490
Got it.

39:26.615 --> 39:29.284
- Come on aboard.
- Thank you. Wow.

39:38.794 --> 39:40.295
That's not food.
