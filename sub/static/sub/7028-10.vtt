in case they have Javi.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.782
You guys in?

08:35.818 --> 08:37.655
I've never believed
in anything more in my life.

08:37.690 --> 08:39.192
All right.

08:40.532 --> 08:42.268
Are we protecting her
or enabling her?

08:42.304 --> 08:43.238
A little of both.

08:43.274 --> 08:44.576
Okay, you guys.

08:44.611 --> 08:47.184
We are, like,
99% sure Javi was kidnapped.

08:47.220 --> 08:48.154
[all gasp]

08:48.189 --> 08:49.557
Mm-hmm.

08:49.594 --> 08:53.269
Now, he was last seen wearing...
actually, I'm not sure,

08:53.304 --> 08:55.075
so I'm just gonna take
a wild guess and say jeans

08:55.110 --> 08:57.114
that are way too tight
and a lot of hair product.

08:57.150 --> 08:58.251
Oh, and the sparkly blouse.

08:58.286 --> 09:00.324
- Mm, that was yesterday.
- Oh, yeah.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.732
We need to get this
on milk cartons ASAP.

09:03.804 --> 09:04.971
Okay?

09:05.007 --> 09:07.747
I know, it's the most
respectable photo I found.

09:07.782 --> 09:09.486
We've got to figure out
who my stalker is

09:09.521 --> 09:12.160
by CSI'ing
all the clues we have.

09:12.196 --> 09:16.474
Here's everything
my stalker sent me.

09:19.618 --> 09:22.291
Well, I haven't figured out
the identity of your stalker,

09:22.327 --> 09:24.732
but they made a collage
of your Target receipts.

09:24.767 --> 09:26.403
How many throw pillows
do you need?

09:26.439 --> 09:27.608
You only have one couch.

09:27.643 --> 09:30.015
Hey, Roxie,
this looks really elaborate.

09:30.050 --> 09:31.018
What have you found out?

09:31.053 --> 09:33.392
Found out?
Not much.

09:33.427 --> 09:35.665
But how cool is this?

09:35.700 --> 09:37.170
I made a flower.

09:37.206 --> 09:38.742
Ana, this is a lot of stuff.

09:38.777 --> 09:40.513
Can you think of anyone who
would hold a grudge against you?

09:40.549 --> 09:42.185
No, people love me.

09:42.221 --> 09:43.957
Uh, my evil twin sister,

09:43.993 --> 09:45.629
when you proved that she was
out to get me.

09:45.665 --> 09:47.234
Kate from "Scientifico Sexy"

09:47.269 --> 09:48.638

<i>at her own game.</i>

09:48.674 --> 09:49.943
My ex-husband
when you made sure

09:49.978 --> 09:51.261
that we didn't get back
together.

09:51.282 --> 09:55.024
Your ex-boyfriend/boss
whose heart you broke.

09:55.060 --> 09:57.800
Plus, that guy that you cut
off on your way in this morning,

09:57.835 --> 09:59.706
he said you were bitchy.

09:59.741 --> 10:02.246
Wait, that was me.
Sorry.

10:02.282 --> 10:05.357
Okay, okay, so I may have
stepped on a few toes,

10:05.392 --> 10:06.760
but we've been at this
for hours,

10:06.796 --> 10:08.900
and all we have to show for it
is that I should wear a bra

10:08.936 --> 10:10.940
when I take out the trash.

10:10.975 --> 10:13.682
Guys,
I guess I have to admit it.

10:13.717 --> 10:15.253
Javi's not kidnapped.

10:15.288 --> 10:18.864
He just probably decided
he didn't want to be with me.

10:18.899 --> 10:20.971
I just wasn't ready to face it.

10:21.006 --> 10:23.311
- Ana.
- No, no, it's okay.

10:23.347 --> 10:25.183
I'm just gonna go home
and hang out with that bird

10:25.218 --> 10:26.554
that won't leave my condo.

10:30.401 --> 10:32.138
Hey, hey, hey, Isaac.

10:32.174 --> 10:34.278
Since you've been working
on a new show idea,

10:34.313 --> 10:36.384
it would be very irresponsible
of me

10:36.419 --> 10:37.822
not to show you
my special skills.

10:41.669 --> 10:43.339
Mime. Really?

10:47.553 --> 10:51.598
Okay, that's not bad.

10:51.633 --> 10:52.601
Wait.
[coughs]

10:52.636 --> 10:54.105
I got more stuff.

10:54.141 --> 10:55.810
I feel so bad for Ana.

10:55.845 --> 10:58.853
She's probably facedown
in a chicken potpie by now.

10:58.889 --> 11:01.193
Okay, where do you think Javi
really is?

11:01.229 --> 11:04.002
Oh, okay,
I'm just gonna say it.

11:04.037 --> 11:06.162
I think he might have gotten
back together with Kelly.

11:06.178 --> 11:07.412
Are we saying that
out loud now?

11:07.447 --> 11:08.890
'Cause I've been thinking it
all day.

11:08.919 --> 11:10.489
I wish for Ana's sake
it wasn't true,

11:10.524 --> 11:11.659
but, I mean, come on.

11:11.694 --> 11:12.996
Kelly is amazing.

11:13.032 --> 11:15.772
Right? Saving all those orphans
from that burning building.

11:15.807 --> 11:19.081
And she's in incredible shape from
her award-winning samba dancing.

11:19.116 --> 11:22.091
And she worked in a hospital
saving lives.

11:22.126 --> 11:24.064
Hospital?

11:24.099 --> 11:26.237
Samba dancing?

11:26.272 --> 11:27.441
Orphans.

11:27.476 --> 11:28.711
Do you know what this means?

11:28.746 --> 11:31.419
Kelly's way too busy.
She needs to unplug.

11:31.455 --> 11:33.760
No, Kelly has been copying

11:33.795 --> 11:36.501
everything that Ana's
been doing in her shows.

11:36.536 --> 11:38.374
But was Ana ever
a cross-dressing

11:38.409 --> 11:41.116
cruise ship director?

11:41.151 --> 11:42.185
[both gasp]

11:42.221 --> 11:43.924
Does this mean
the stalker is...

11:43.960 --> 11:46.264
Kelly,
what are you doing here?

11:46.300 --> 11:48.103
I heard you were looking
for Javi.

11:48.139 --> 11:50.946
Well, I found him.

11:50.981 --> 11:52.182
[grunting]

11:52.218 --> 11:54.556
Yes, bound and gagged.
I knew it.

11:56.598 --> 11:58.081
I'm sorry.
Did you find him like that?

11:58.103 --> 11:59.539
Or did you do that to him?

11:59.574 --> 12:02.815
Oh, no, my bad.
Yeah, I totally did that to him.

12:02.850 --> 12:03.919
Oh.

12:04.054 --> 12:05.289
Oh.

12:06.791 --> 12:09.196
So wait.
You're my stalker?

12:09.232 --> 12:13.074
We prefer
unrequited best friend.

12:13.672 --> 12:16.044
Why is this happening?
I don't even know you.

12:16.079 --> 12:17.815
Yes, but I know you.

12:17.851 --> 12:20.056
See, my parents worked
all the time.

12:20.091 --> 12:22.597
Literally.
They owned a 24 Hour Fitness.

12:22.632 --> 12:24.503
So I was raised by babysitters,

12:24.538 --> 12:26.810
and they all watched
your telenovelas.

12:26.845 --> 12:29.484
In a way, the one constant
in my life was you.

12:29.520 --> 12:30.822
Aww.

12:30.857 --> 12:32.193
Kelly, just let Ana go.

12:32.228 --> 12:33.296
She doesn't have anything
to do with this.

12:33.331 --> 12:36.038
Ana has everything
to do with this.

12:36.074 --> 12:38.144
You're just a pawn, pretty boy.

12:38.180 --> 12:39.482
Ooh, hoo-hoo.

12:39.517 --> 12:41.421
I don't understand.
What do you want?

12:41.457 --> 12:45.333
To be you, of course, which
is why I copied your shows.

12:45.368 --> 12:46.771
I followed you everywhere.

12:46.806 --> 12:48.075
I went through your trash.

12:48.111 --> 12:50.415
P.S.,
you should really recycle more,

12:50.450 --> 12:51.954
if not for us,
then for the children.

12:51.989 --> 12:53.993
- They are our future.
- Why are you agreeing with her?

12:54.028 --> 12:56.334
Because she has us tied up.
Plus, she has a point.

12:56.369 --> 12:58.975
I did whatever I could
just to be you,

12:59.010 --> 13:00.446
including date Javi,

13:00.481 --> 13:02.753
but it was pretty clear that
he still had feelings for you,

13:02.788 --> 13:05.294
that I would never be enough
for him.

13:05.329 --> 13:08.036
And then I realized
that no matter what I did,

13:08.071 --> 13:10.477
I could actually never
really be you.

13:10.512 --> 13:13.519
So I might have gone
a little bit crazy.

13:13.555 --> 13:16.060
But now I have a new plan.

13:16.095 --> 13:18.267
To let us go? Great.
No harm, no foul.

13:18.303 --> 13:21.811
- We keep this between us.
- No, if I can't be Ana,

13:21.846 --> 13:24.687
I'm gonna be Ana's best friend.
Do you want to be best friends?

13:24.722 --> 13:25.656
Yes.

our last conversation,

14:34.168 --> 14:35.637

to talk about?

14:35.672 --> 14:36.840
Besides, those jeans have
too many pockets.

16:58.743 --> 16:59.878
All the time.

16:59.913 --> 17:01.582
It's got a cheese port
and two wine glasses.

17:01.619 --> 17:03.288
Oh, I love it.
That's incredible.

17:03.323 --> 17:04.626
- Where did you buy it?
- Okay.

17:04.661 --> 17:07.701
Ahh!

17:07.737 --> 17:09.106
Wait. Wait.

17:09.141 --> 17:10.824
Are you really gonna kill
your best friend?

17:10.847 --> 17:13.251
Well, we've only been best
friends for, like, 20 minutes.

17:13.288 --> 17:14.321
I'll get over it.

17:14.357 --> 17:15.592
Argh!
Ahh!

17:21.713 --> 17:23.182
Let's go save Ana.

17:23.217 --> 17:24.653
- Whoo!
- Oh!

17:26.661 --> 17:28.632
Or that could happen.

17:47.067 --> 17:51.411
Hey, that was pretty scary
stuff back there, huh?

17:51.413 --> 17:53.919
I didn't know how crazy
Kelly is.

17:53.921 --> 17:55.558
You know what was crazy?

17:55.560 --> 17:57.364
You were gonna let her kill you
to protect me.

17:58.735 --> 18:00.371
Look, Javi,
I really need to know

18:00.373 --> 18:02.412
so I can move on either way.

18:02.414 --> 18:04.016
Were you gonna show up
to coffee?

18:04.018 --> 18:05.922
Yes, I was.

18:05.924 --> 18:07.928
The only thing that could have
kept me away from you

18:07.930 --> 18:09.566
was a knife-wielding maniac.

18:09.568 --> 18:11.272
Although I was running late,

18:11.274 --> 18:13.579
because I was parallel parking,
and someone was watching,

18:13.581 --> 18:16.120
but I was gonna be there.

18:17.527 --> 18:20.634
I can't stop thinking about you,
Ana, about us.

18:20.636 --> 18:23.609
Me too.

18:24.581 --> 18:25.716
How do you have your guitar?

18:25.718 --> 18:28.224
I always have it.
I actually wrote you a song.

18:28.226 --> 18:29.995
I was gonna sing it for you
at the coffee shop.

18:29.997 --> 18:31.601
I mean, I know how much
you hate my guitar,

18:31.603 --> 18:33.206
so I don't have to;
I really don't have to.

18:33.208 --> 18:34.843
Sing the damn song, Javi.

I'm back from the dead.

You died?

19:55.560 --> 19:57.262
I fell off a mountain.

I was buried in snow for days.
It took me weeks to recover.

you didn't hear from me?

20:02.314 --> 20:04.886

when I got back to Miami

20:04.888 --> 20:07.427
was get me a snow cone.

Ana, the only thing
that kept me alive out there

20:12.477 --> 20:14.414
was the thought
of getting back to you.
