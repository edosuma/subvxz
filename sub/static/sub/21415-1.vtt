01:27.780 --> 01:30.249
The latest news from
the land of the stars.

01:30.250 --> 01:33.952
Minna Davis fans everywhere
are rejoicing this week

01:33.953 --> 01:38.090
as Brady-American Pictures
begins production on...

01:41.361 --> 01:44.429
Minna, Hollywood's beloved Gaelic gal,

01:44.430 --> 01:46.565
died tragically two years ago

01:46.566 --> 01:48.600
when fire swept through the mansion

01:48.601 --> 01:50.735
she shared with her husband

01:50.736 --> 01:53.672
Brady-American mogul Monroe Stahr.

01:53.673 --> 01:57.342
Now her rags-to-riches story
is coming to the screen,

01:57.343 --> 01:59.211
and guess who's penning it.

01:59.212 --> 02:02.847
Her own brother, screenwriter Dex Davis.

02:02.848 --> 02:04.416
Rest in peace, Minna.

02:04.417 --> 02:07.786
We'll see you and your American Dream

02:07.787 --> 02:09.422
at the movies.

02:13.927 --> 02:15.647
Brady-American Pictures.
Good morning.

03:04.745 --> 03:06.378
Monroe,

03:06.379 --> 03:07.680
thank you.

03:09.049 --> 03:10.615
It's lovely.

03:13.419 --> 03:14.821
Celia.

03:15.688 --> 03:17.156
Christ.

03:17.157 --> 03:18.724
Monroe, I...

03:18.725 --> 03:21.060
I feel terrible. Was it from Minna?

03:21.061 --> 03:22.327
That's hardly the point.

03:22.328 --> 03:23.963
Mary.

03:23.964 --> 03:26.298
I actually came here
to talk to you about Spain.

03:26.299 --> 03:28.901
Is that right? We'll need some glue.

03:28.902 --> 03:31.070
Right away, Mr. Stahr.

03:31.071 --> 03:33.038
There won't be any rushes
from the Mountie picture.

03:33.039 --> 03:34.706
They lost a day due to snow,

03:34.707 --> 03:36.208
and when you're done with Mr. Brady,

03:36.209 --> 03:38.009
you'll have two meetings.
Can it be fixed?

03:38.812 --> 03:40.246
I think so.

03:41.314 --> 03:42.882
Which meeting should I reschedule?

03:42.883 --> 03:45.785
The one with Celia's fiance Mr. White.

03:45.786 --> 03:48.687
Who, Wylie? He's not my fiance.

03:48.688 --> 03:49.955
I heard he asked you to marry him.

03:49.956 --> 03:51.590
Thank you, Mary.

03:51.591 --> 03:53.025
And did you have any reaction?

03:53.026 --> 03:54.894
Yes. I thought you'd
make a lovely couple

03:54.895 --> 03:56.962
if you wait until he's
been sober for two years

03:56.963 --> 03:58.597
or maybe five minutes.

03:58.598 --> 04:01.967
Well, that's disappointing.

04:01.968 --> 04:03.836
Everyone says I bloomed this summer.

04:03.837 --> 04:05.906
I thought you'd noticed.

04:07.573 --> 04:09.274
Let's get you back to Bennington.

04:09.275 --> 04:11.344
You can bloom some more.

04:12.545 --> 04:14.746
When are you going to take me seriously,
Monroe?

04:14.747 --> 04:16.515
I can help you.

04:16.516 --> 04:18.450
I have ideas, great stories.

04:18.451 --> 04:20.652
Got one about this
bandleader who's going...

04:20.653 --> 04:21.954
I'm excited to hear it...

04:21.954 --> 04:24.190
after you've graduated.

04:26.459 --> 04:29.194
I heard you were unhappy
with the rushes, Monroe.

04:29.195 --> 04:30.629
Yes, I was.

04:30.630 --> 04:31.897
Mind if I ask why?

04:31.898 --> 04:33.866
Because he shot the whole thing on a 35

04:33.867 --> 04:35.167
when it should have been a 50.

04:35.168 --> 04:36.501
All the tension was lost.

04:36.502 --> 04:38.237
And he cut the gag with the pith helmet.

04:38.238 --> 04:40.772
I love that.
And who dressed those natives?

04:40.773 --> 04:42.274
They look like lollipops.

04:43.376 --> 04:44.609
You're fired.

04:44.610 --> 04:46.378
Easy, Calde.

04:46.379 --> 04:49.014
There's still a few things
your family doesn't own.

04:49.015 --> 04:50.315
Good morning, Felicity.

04:50.316 --> 04:53.053
My suggestions for your retakes.

04:55.288 --> 04:56.521
So thorough.

04:56.522 --> 04:58.723
I'm not talented enough
to be unprepared.

04:58.724 --> 05:00.792
Are you?

05:00.793 --> 05:03.595
Uh, sorry, fellas.
Kay, I have some selling to do,

05:03.596 --> 05:04.830
and Pat's expecting me.

05:04.831 --> 05:06.098
Did you get a chance to read...

05:06.099 --> 05:08.001
Yes. It's much better. Well done.

05:09.069 --> 05:10.836
I only have two weeks, Monroe.

05:10.837 --> 05:12.205
Then I fly back.

05:13.373 --> 05:15.207
Hi, Wylie.

05:15.208 --> 05:17.009
Darling.

05:17.010 --> 05:18.845
See that she does fly back, Wylie.

05:20.513 --> 05:22.148
Or I'll break your neck.

05:24.184 --> 05:26.953
Good morning, Birdy.
Good morning, Mr. Stahr.

05:28.554 --> 05:31.090
Ask someone to travel this far, Pat,

05:31.091 --> 05:32.624
you ought to provide cab fare.

05:32.625 --> 05:35.427
I thought you Israelites were
used to crossing the desert.

05:35.428 --> 05:36.561
Hmm.

05:36.562 --> 05:38.163
What was my daughter doing
in your office today?

05:38.164 --> 05:40.099
A bit of redecorating.

05:40.100 --> 05:42.434
I don't want her spending too
much time in this environment.

05:42.435 --> 05:43.535
It's unhealthy.

05:43.536 --> 05:45.570
Well, maybe she just wants to be closer

05:45.571 --> 05:47.172
to her dear old dad.

05:47.173 --> 05:49.774
Or to see Gary Cooper.

05:49.775 --> 05:51.076
He's coming in today.

05:51.077 --> 05:52.344
Heck of an actor.

05:52.345 --> 05:53.545
He's a prostitute.

05:53.546 --> 05:55.447
Everybody who comes into
this office is a prostitute.

05:55.448 --> 05:57.182
They don't walk in here
unless they want something.

05:57.183 --> 06:00.053
Gee, Pat, I walked in here.

06:01.054 --> 06:02.821
I like your new secretary.

06:02.822 --> 06:04.856
Felicity, is that it?

06:04.857 --> 06:06.191
We have a deal about that.

06:06.192 --> 06:08.227
Anybody but my secretaries.

06:08.228 --> 06:10.462
What if she is attracted to me?

06:10.463 --> 06:11.530
Heh heh heh heh.

06:11.531 --> 06:14.733
The human heart is a hard
muscle to fathom.

06:14.734 --> 06:16.835
Your heart's not the muscle
I'm worried about.

06:16.836 --> 06:20.372
Heh heh. I just hate to see
a pretty secretary go to waste.

06:20.373 --> 06:22.075
Did you see this?

06:26.512 --> 06:28.513
I want to start doing what MGM's doing.

06:28.514 --> 06:31.350
They're the only shop in town
making any money.

06:31.351 --> 06:34.453
Sally Sweet.

06:34.454 --> 06:37.856
She can sing, dance,
cries at the drop of a hat.

06:37.857 --> 06:40.092
Knock Shirley Temple right on her ass.

06:40.093 --> 06:41.293
Build a musical around her:

06:41.294 --> 06:42.861
farm girl with dreams of the big city,

06:42.862 --> 06:44.229
that kind of thing.

06:44.230 --> 06:46.065
The creative side's still your domain,
but...

06:46.066 --> 06:48.233
I'm always open to a good idea.

06:48.234 --> 06:52.072
I'm sure there's a compliment
in there somewhere.

06:53.906 --> 06:55.207
What's for sale today?

06:55.208 --> 06:58.411
The promise of America in a single shot.

07:00.346 --> 07:03.648
Start on the kids... Minna and Dex.

07:03.649 --> 07:04.849
Hope in their eyes.

07:04.850 --> 07:06.818
Awe. What are they looking at?

07:06.819 --> 07:10.089
We pull back to reveal
hundreds of immigrants

07:10.090 --> 07:11.490
behind them on that boat,

07:11.491 --> 07:13.158
becoming thousands.

07:13.159 --> 07:14.960
That same look on every face.

07:14.961 --> 07:16.395
If we keep pulling back,

07:16.396 --> 07:18.563
panning left now to see
what they're staring at:

07:18.564 --> 07:19.798
New York Harbor.

07:19.799 --> 07:21.333
The skyline of Manhattan.

07:21.334 --> 07:23.802
Impossibly big and grand.

07:23.803 --> 07:25.770
And the Statue of Liberty

07:25.771 --> 07:28.408
lifting her lamp to welcome
them to their new home.

07:29.842 --> 07:31.143
Looks expensive.

07:31.144 --> 07:32.344
But memorable.

07:32.345 --> 07:33.945
And half the country came over

07:33.946 --> 07:35.180
on a boat like that.

07:35.181 --> 07:36.948
You're breaking me, you know.

07:36.949 --> 07:39.219
Could be our Oscar, Pat.

07:40.253 --> 07:41.953
We don't need an Oscar.

07:41.954 --> 07:43.422
Yes, we do.

07:43.423 --> 07:45.958
Just think how much
it'll impress Felicity.

07:50.063 --> 07:51.630
Good morning, Mr. Stahr.

07:51.631 --> 07:52.931
Ladies.

07:55.801 --> 07:58.003
I got it! I got it!

07:58.004 --> 08:00.072
Wonderful.
They said they loved it.

08:00.073 --> 08:01.574
Congratulations.

08:06.212 --> 08:08.480
Why is it, Calde,
that whenever you're around

08:08.481 --> 08:11.750
I always feel some horrible
crime's about to be committed?

08:11.751 --> 08:13.418
I'm studying you,

08:13.419 --> 08:15.387
watching how you put up with people

08:15.388 --> 08:18.690
I know you detest, like me.

08:18.691 --> 08:21.293
How do you do that?

08:21.294 --> 08:23.995
Calde told me about the pith helmet gag,
Monroe.

08:23.996 --> 08:25.830
Don't worry. It's going back in.

08:25.831 --> 08:27.399
Gable's already in makeup.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.600
See, Calde?

08:28.601 --> 08:30.770
There's no profit in the anger business.

08:33.039 --> 08:34.839
You know, I had to do a similar bit

08:34.840 --> 08:36.674
back when I was acting.

08:36.676 --> 08:37.743
Funny as hell!

08:40.145 --> 08:41.780
God, you're an idiot.

08:50.022 --> 08:52.657
He does draw a crowd, that Monroe.

08:52.658 --> 08:53.925
Hmm.

08:53.926 --> 08:56.695
Something troubling you, Tommy?

08:56.696 --> 08:57.962
Yes.

08:57.963 --> 09:00.432
Jews and money.

09:00.433 --> 09:03.102
I saw it all the time
in the old country.

09:03.103 --> 09:06.271
They are so tired
of being called stingy.

09:06.272 --> 09:09.474
They will overpay for things
just to prove it isn't true.

09:09.475 --> 09:11.410
Now, what gets me about this Jew

09:11.411 --> 09:15.013
is the money he's
doing it with is yours.

09:15.014 --> 09:16.716
Can I tell you a secret?

09:18.151 --> 09:19.585
He's a bargain.

09:37.537 --> 09:38.771
Rehearsal up.

09:40.106 --> 09:42.674
Minna at the party.

09:42.675 --> 09:44.410
Just out of Makeup.

09:54.354 --> 09:56.088
Places, honey.

09:57.523 --> 09:58.923
Hello, Bess.

09:58.924 --> 10:00.159
Hello, Gladys.

10:00.160 --> 10:01.826
Good morning.

10:01.827 --> 10:04.364
So, this one?

10:05.231 --> 10:07.932
Or this one?

10:07.933 --> 10:09.801
This one.

10:09.802 --> 10:11.204
My, my.

10:12.272 --> 10:14.973
A beautiful actress on a beautiful set

10:14.974 --> 10:16.642
in my favorite picture.

10:17.810 --> 10:19.345
What a morning.

10:20.746 --> 10:21.746
Thanks, Bess.

10:22.782 --> 10:23.782
But...

10:25.151 --> 10:26.818
Cheer up, honey.

10:26.819 --> 10:29.355
It isn't you. He just doesn't date.

10:30.590 --> 10:33.892
Maybe if I'd been stark naked.

10:33.893 --> 10:35.594
A couple girls have tried.

10:35.595 --> 10:38.198
But you can't compete with a ghost.

10:43.903 --> 10:44.903
Hello.

11:02.021 --> 11:03.988
Did you knock this time?

11:03.989 --> 11:05.757
Sorry, Aubrey.

11:05.758 --> 11:08.260
Well, I guess you don't have to.

11:08.261 --> 11:09.928
Want to support the Spanish loyalists?

11:09.929 --> 11:12.497
Oh, gosh,
and I was hoping you'd come here

11:12.498 --> 11:14.499
to ask me to the Screen Writers Ball,

11:14.500 --> 11:17.303
but as much as I like
to watch you shake your can...

11:24.310 --> 11:25.844
Do you believe in them?

11:25.845 --> 11:26.845
Unions?

11:26.846 --> 11:30.749
Mm-hmm. For drivers, grips, stitchers.

11:30.750 --> 11:31.916
Of course.

11:31.917 --> 11:33.618
I talk to my father
about it all the time.

11:33.619 --> 11:37.088
So why is he about to build
his Park Avenue set...

11:37.089 --> 11:39.859
Nonunion? I don't know.

11:41.160 --> 11:42.927
Guess I'm kind of a joke to you.

11:42.928 --> 11:45.798
No. Jokes are funny.

11:48.501 --> 11:51.069
Didn't hear your keys clacking, Aubrey.

11:51.070 --> 11:52.437
Are you stuck?

11:52.438 --> 11:53.972
I was babysitting.

11:53.973 --> 11:55.707
I'd rather you went to church.

11:55.708 --> 11:58.710
This draft... your minister
character's starting to sound

11:58.711 --> 12:00.545
like something from The Scarlet Letter.

12:00.546 --> 12:02.581
When was the last time
you were in a church?

12:02.582 --> 12:04.883
I do my praying at the box office.

12:04.884 --> 12:05.785
You know that.

12:05.786 --> 12:08.453
Hey, been on set this morning, Dex?

12:08.454 --> 12:11.423
I haven't left here since I
got your notes last night.

12:11.424 --> 12:12.957
Don't you ever sleep?

12:12.958 --> 12:14.192
It looks great.

12:14.193 --> 12:15.327
Swanky as hell.

12:15.328 --> 12:17.296
Bess is the perfect Minna.

12:17.297 --> 12:20.600
And, Dex, Pat approved the boat.

12:23.168 --> 12:25.370
How did you manage that?

12:25.371 --> 12:27.639
He loves this movie, and he loves you.

12:29.275 --> 12:31.109
Now all I need are the pages.

12:31.110 --> 12:32.444
Done.

12:32.445 --> 12:35.981
This is why people need unions.

12:37.383 --> 12:39.585
To church, Aubrey.

12:59.472 --> 13:02.474
This next to my lot.

13:02.475 --> 13:05.510
I warned the mayor about this, didn't I?

13:05.511 --> 13:07.312
Told them this was
no place for a Hooverville.

13:07.313 --> 13:10.750
How am I supposed to walk Garbo
and Carole Lombard past this?

13:12.184 --> 13:13.918
Damn pigsty.

13:13.919 --> 13:16.321
Now I get to be the heartless mogul

13:16.322 --> 13:18.490
who drove all these poor people away.

13:18.491 --> 13:22.627
Well, Park Avenue's got to go somewhere.

13:22.628 --> 13:23.763
Yeah.

13:25.164 --> 13:27.467
They had to come to Hollywood.

13:36.542 --> 13:38.944
You give me that back. It's mine.

13:43.082 --> 13:44.749
Put that down, Nathan.

13:44.750 --> 13:47.420
I don't want to be up
all night with you sick.

13:50.690 --> 13:52.858
Take 14!

13:54.226 --> 13:55.827
Hi, Monroe.

13:55.828 --> 13:58.029
Tell me, Red, what do you notice

13:58.030 --> 13:59.698
about your Sheba head?

13:59.699 --> 14:02.701
That it's sitting on someone else's set.

14:02.702 --> 14:06.871
No. It's sitting on someone
else's finished set,

14:06.872 --> 14:09.708
whereas your Sheba head
isn't really a head at all,

14:09.709 --> 14:11.876
which is why I'm sending
it back to the mill.

14:11.877 --> 14:13.778
Well,
it just seemed like a foolish place

14:13.779 --> 14:15.013
to spend your money, Monroe.

14:15.014 --> 14:16.548
I mean, we're not shooting behind it.

14:16.549 --> 14:18.049
You let me worry about that.

14:18.050 --> 14:21.453
But why?
I mean, no one will ever see it.

14:21.454 --> 14:23.221
The actors will see it.

14:23.222 --> 14:24.523
Oh, well, they're pros, Monroe.

14:24.524 --> 14:25.790
I'm sure they're...
Red.

14:25.791 --> 14:26.792
Yes?

14:33.098 --> 14:34.767
My father was a carpenter.

14:35.835 --> 14:36.669
One night,

14:36.670 --> 14:38.470
I found him at his work bench

14:38.471 --> 14:40.338
sanding the back of a drawer.

14:40.339 --> 14:41.540
He was painting it.

14:41.541 --> 14:42.907
I said, "Dad,

14:42.908 --> 14:44.743
why are you painting
the back of a drawer?

14:44.744 --> 14:46.445
No one will ever see it."

14:46.446 --> 14:48.513
He said, "I'll see it."

14:48.514 --> 14:50.649
Understand?

14:50.650 --> 14:52.952
Yes.

14:54.353 --> 14:55.955
We'll take care of it.

15:00.059 --> 15:02.561
I thought your father sold shirt trims.

15:02.562 --> 15:04.630
You writing a biography now?

15:18.077 --> 15:19.078
Monroe.

15:22.782 --> 15:23.782
Pat.

15:26.418 --> 15:27.919
Vandy.

15:27.920 --> 15:29.521
Meet the new German
consulate here in L.A.

15:29.522 --> 15:30.855
Dr. Georg Gyssling.

15:30.856 --> 15:33.425
Oh, yeah? Doctor of what?

15:34.460 --> 15:35.760
Doctor's going to be consulting

15:35.761 --> 15:36.861
on our production slate.

15:36.862 --> 15:38.062
There's a new law in Germany.

15:38.063 --> 15:39.931
Article 15, did you say, Doctor?

15:39.932 --> 15:41.099
First let me say

15:41.100 --> 15:43.134
there is no bigger film
fan than the Fuhrer.

15:43.135 --> 15:45.970
He watches a picture every
night before retiring.

15:45.971 --> 15:48.206
Big fan of Shirley Temple, I'm told.

15:48.207 --> 15:50.174
Just so. Wonderful child.

15:50.175 --> 15:51.710
Dr. Gyssling just wants to make sure

15:51.711 --> 15:53.044
that we're not producing anything

15:53.045 --> 15:54.946
that might be offensive
to the German people.

15:54.947 --> 15:56.715
The German people have
produced a few things

15:56.716 --> 15:57.882
that are offensive to me.

15:57.883 --> 15:59.619
Do I get to consult on that?

16:00.520 --> 16:02.854
The Article is clear.

16:02.855 --> 16:05.524
Any company distributing a picture

16:05.525 --> 16:06.991
containing anti-German content

16:06.992 --> 16:08.860
will no longer be granted a permit

16:08.861 --> 16:10.862
to export films to Germany.

16:10.863 --> 16:12.997
That is now Reich law.

16:12.998 --> 16:15.567
When it's U.S. law or Hollywood law,

16:15.568 --> 16:16.635
let me know.

16:16.636 --> 16:17.936
Until then...

16:17.937 --> 16:19.337
He's already been to Paramount,

16:19.338 --> 16:21.139
Twentieth, Universal,

16:21.140 --> 16:22.440
Warners, and Metro.

16:22.441 --> 16:24.208
They've all gone along.

16:24.209 --> 16:25.977
I'll bet.

16:25.978 --> 16:27.245
Have to make sure

16:27.246 --> 16:29.380
the Fuhrer has something
to watch every night,

16:29.381 --> 16:30.715
don't we?

16:30.716 --> 16:32.116
It's still our studio, Monroe. He...

16:32.117 --> 16:35.688
Pat, I have pictures to see to.

16:59.879 --> 17:00.913
Let's go.

17:03.816 --> 17:05.817
Stay close, Nathan.

17:16.395 --> 17:18.262
Max.

17:18.262 --> 17:19.430
Turn around, turn around.

17:19.431 --> 17:21.733
Hey, get out of here.

17:25.404 --> 17:27.405
You, too. Out.

17:27.406 --> 17:29.407
Where, Mister?

17:29.408 --> 17:31.576
You tell me where.

17:31.577 --> 17:33.645
We don't have a roof.

17:33.646 --> 17:36.047
Okay, One night right there.

17:36.048 --> 17:38.584
But you're gone in the morning,
all right?

18:41.981 --> 18:44.749
My congratulations on
The Bells of Boston.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.350
Should make a fine picture.

18:46.351 --> 18:48.086
Triumph of the common man.

18:48.087 --> 18:51.155
The others are more worrisome.

18:51.156 --> 18:53.357
The Kindly Doctor. In that comedy,

18:53.358 --> 18:55.359
you have named him Goldberg.

18:55.360 --> 18:57.095
We would like that changed.

18:57.096 --> 18:58.063
Perhaps Smith.

18:58.064 --> 19:00.098
In Borough Park, Brooklyn?

19:00.099 --> 19:02.100
Do you want your picture
released in Germany

19:02.101 --> 19:03.002
or don't you?

19:03.003 --> 19:06.070
And the villain in that thriller

19:06.071 --> 19:08.372
you have described here as Nordic.

19:08.373 --> 19:11.844
I will want to see pictures
before that role is cast.

19:14.213 --> 19:16.414
Good.

19:16.415 --> 19:17.816
And one thing more.

19:17.817 --> 19:19.818
The Fuhrer has decreed

19:19.819 --> 19:22.721
that all foreign companies
doing business in Germany

19:22.722 --> 19:24.655
must now rid their German branches

19:24.656 --> 19:26.791
of any Jewish personnel.

19:26.792 --> 19:29.427
Your cooperation is requested.

19:29.428 --> 19:31.029
That's half our Berlin office.

19:31.030 --> 19:33.597
Ja. Sadly, they'll have to go.

19:33.598 --> 19:37.301
Perhaps we could just change
all their names to Smith.

19:37.302 --> 19:41.306
A snail might take off its shell,
but it's still a snail.

19:42.307 --> 19:44.508
Are we through here?
No.

19:44.509 --> 19:46.979
This one won't do at all.

19:50.349 --> 19:51.883
Beg your pardon?

19:51.884 --> 19:53.818
Your heroine is a Gentile woman

19:53.819 --> 19:56.620
who goes on to marry a Jew: you.

19:56.621 --> 19:59.490
The picture's over long before then.
Pat, are you...

19:59.491 --> 20:01.225
The world knows what she did,

20:01.226 --> 20:03.327
and it offends the racial sensibilities

20:03.328 --> 20:04.428
of the German people.

20:04.429 --> 20:07.999
You'll have to kill it
or change her name.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.735
Sorry, pal. That one's already shooting.

20:10.736 --> 20:12.070
So you'll just have to move along.

20:12.071 --> 20:14.406
You could just change the name, Monroe.

20:15.607 --> 20:17.141
You mean Minna?

20:17.142 --> 20:18.743
My wife?

20:18.744 --> 20:21.312
The one who helped us build this place?

20:21.313 --> 20:23.414
Most of what we shot could still work.

20:23.415 --> 20:24.482
Loop a few lines.

20:24.483 --> 20:26.317
Or we tell him to go jump in a lake.

20:26.318 --> 20:28.119
It's not his decision.

20:28.120 --> 20:29.755
It's mine.

20:32.758 --> 20:35.194
I will leave you to discuss this.

20:40.833 --> 20:42.867
It's our second biggest foreign market,

20:42.868 --> 20:44.235
and we need the money.

20:44.236 --> 20:47.371
So some Kraut says jump,
and you just do it?

20:47.372 --> 20:48.807
In a Depression, yes.

20:48.808 --> 20:50.341
We make a product, Monroe.

20:50.342 --> 20:52.010
There has to be someone to buy it.

20:52.011 --> 20:54.378
That someone is every kid
in the streets, Pat.

20:54.379 --> 20:59.150
Pictures like this matter
when you have nothing else.

20:59.151 --> 21:00.119
I know.

21:00.120 --> 21:01.886
It's a war we don't want.

21:01.887 --> 21:04.289
A war is where both sides
put up a fight.

21:05.858 --> 21:07.859
But it's your lot.

21:07.860 --> 21:09.093
My lot.

21:09.094 --> 21:10.829
My name on the gates.

21:10.830 --> 21:13.198
I'd like to keep them open.

21:14.266 --> 21:15.766
I'm leaving, Pat.

21:15.767 --> 21:18.903
Meeting go all right, Monroe?

21:18.904 --> 21:21.772
Only if you like book burnings.

21:21.773 --> 21:23.908
Well, I wouldn't know about all that.

21:23.909 --> 21:25.443
I'm just the banker.

21:25.444 --> 21:27.011
Also an adult.

21:27.012 --> 21:30.181
Also a venal prick. Now what?

21:30.182 --> 21:33.184
Dinner at the California Club tomorrow,
Pat?

21:33.185 --> 21:36.788
I look forward to the privacy.

21:39.258 --> 21:40.324
See?

21:40.325 --> 21:42.460
Everyone has to answer to someone.

21:42.461 --> 21:45.529
We fought the board before, you and I,

21:45.530 --> 21:47.165
plenty of times. He's just...

21:47.166 --> 21:48.867
I don't want to end up like RKO.

21:48.868 --> 21:50.568
RKO made lousy movies.

21:50.569 --> 21:51.769
Ah.

21:51.770 --> 21:54.505
And you owe that kid in the street, Pat.

21:54.506 --> 21:56.207
He made you rich.

21:56.208 --> 21:58.642
You know how grateful I am to you.

21:58.643 --> 22:00.644
Then kill anything else.

22:00.645 --> 22:03.314
Just not this.

22:03.315 --> 22:07.186
You can't have art without commerce,
Monroe.

22:08.320 --> 22:09.922
Goddamn coward.

22:16.228 --> 22:17.761
If you want to tell your story so bad,

22:17.762 --> 22:19.131
you go buy your own studio.

22:20.132 --> 22:21.500
You're not going to sink mine.

22:38.150 --> 22:40.019
How's the vase coming?

22:40.886 --> 22:42.521
There's hope, I think.

23:02.574 --> 23:04.708
You're thinking of something.

23:04.709 --> 23:07.279
I can always tell.

23:08.880 --> 23:11.049
A picture?

23:11.050 --> 23:12.850
It's not fully formed yet.

23:12.851 --> 23:14.153
Tell me anyway.

23:15.720 --> 23:18.023
I want to make a picture about you.

23:21.360 --> 23:22.560
You're joking.

23:22.561 --> 23:25.097
No. Your story.

23:26.398 --> 23:30.034
A young girl starving in Ireland.

23:30.035 --> 23:33.437
Father dead, mother overwhelmed.

23:33.438 --> 23:36.207
She's got one thing that gives her hope:

23:36.208 --> 23:38.009
the promise of America.

23:38.010 --> 23:39.510
You're awfully sweet,

23:39.511 --> 23:41.212
but I don't think anybody's
going to care about...

23:41.213 --> 23:44.148
She and her kid brother make
the crossing in steerage.

23:44.149 --> 23:47.385
And the relatives awaiting
them in Hell's Kitchen

23:47.386 --> 23:48.953
put them to work in a sweatshop.

23:48.954 --> 23:50.554
No.
Yes.

23:50.555 --> 23:52.223
But one break.

23:52.224 --> 23:54.158
One talent scout who spots her

23:54.159 --> 23:55.893
behind the notions counter,

23:55.894 --> 23:57.662
and she winds up being you.

23:59.864 --> 24:01.865
The American dream.

24:01.866 --> 24:04.536
The story of Minna Davis.

24:07.172 --> 24:08.472
Your brother can write it.

24:08.473 --> 24:11.110
He's really gotten quite good.

24:12.111 --> 24:14.045
Would you like that?

24:14.046 --> 24:16.480
Being immortal?

24:16.481 --> 24:19.484
I think marrying you did that.

24:21.386 --> 24:23.655
I want to tell your story, Minna.

24:26.658 --> 24:29.593
Camera cranes like
the one you're about to see

24:29.594 --> 24:33.498
can weigh up to 5,000 pounds,
requiring a crew of six.

24:35.534 --> 24:38.669
And this is the set of American Dream,

24:38.670 --> 24:40.004
the Minna Davis story,

24:40.005 --> 24:42.141
where shooting began this week.

24:45.310 --> 24:48.146
You all knew Minna
as filmdom's biggest star,

24:48.147 --> 24:50.914
but did you know that,
before being discovered

24:50.915 --> 24:52.516
at a drugstore notions counter,

24:52.517 --> 24:55.719
she and her brother Declan
had been penniless waifs

24:55.720 --> 24:57.655
living on the streets of New York?

24:57.656 --> 25:01.725
Of course,
Minna died tragically in a fire

25:01.726 --> 25:04.295
two years ago.

25:04.296 --> 25:06.097
All Hollywood wept.

25:07.332 --> 25:10.268
But, thanks to the magic of film,

25:10.269 --> 25:13.405
her American dream will
be with us forever.

25:14.573 --> 25:19.044
Now let's go see a real Sahara desert.

25:38.930 --> 25:42.066
Did you ever have to live
in the streets, Tommy?

25:42.067 --> 25:44.468
All the time as a kid.

25:44.469 --> 25:46.037
Me, too.

25:47.606 --> 25:49.540
Builds character.

25:49.541 --> 25:53.312
And I am sick of this place
being half the size of MGM.

25:56.481 --> 25:58.716
So is everyone kicking in,

25:58.717 --> 26:00.284
or do we open up Celia's coin cans

26:00.285 --> 26:02.086
and let the Spanish
loyalists buy us lunch?

26:02.087 --> 26:03.487
You shouldn't joke, Wylie.

26:03.488 --> 26:05.123
It's terrible what Franco's doing.

26:05.124 --> 26:06.824
Didn't you read about Badajoz?

26:06.825 --> 26:09.127
When someone opens up
a movie house in Badajoz,

26:09.128 --> 26:10.628
then I'll worry about Badajoz.

26:10.629 --> 26:11.695
Until then.

26:11.696 --> 26:13.131
He really is a fiend.

26:13.132 --> 26:17.135
No. I'm just not 19 and adorable.

26:17.136 --> 26:18.302
She is appealing, Wylie.

26:18.303 --> 26:19.603
No, I know.

26:19.604 --> 26:21.339
Nearly as appealing
as her father's money,

26:21.340 --> 26:22.573
and that's a lot.

26:22.574 --> 26:25.409
And you wonder why she won't marry you.

26:25.410 --> 26:26.610
I do?

26:26.611 --> 26:28.312
Fascism's going to destroy Europe.

26:28.313 --> 26:29.580
I don't know why.

26:29.581 --> 26:31.449
It's working pretty well in Hollywood.

26:38.357 --> 26:39.758
You got a minute, Dex?

26:42.361 --> 26:43.395
Me?

26:45.364 --> 26:47.365
We'll find something else for you.

26:47.366 --> 26:48.499
No.

26:48.500 --> 26:51.235
I can't fail anymore, Monroe.

26:51.236 --> 26:53.036
It hurts too much.

26:53.037 --> 26:55.773
You didn't fail, Dex. I did.

26:55.774 --> 26:57.241
But people keep score.

26:57.242 --> 26:59.743
A writer's either getting
his pictures made,

26:59.744 --> 27:00.778
or he's not.

27:00.779 --> 27:02.214
You got your picture made.

27:03.482 --> 27:06.116
Three days' worth anyway.

27:06.117 --> 27:07.751
The movie is the baby.

27:07.752 --> 27:09.887
Isn't that what you're always saying?

27:09.888 --> 27:11.822
We must protect the baby.

27:11.823 --> 27:14.258
So why can't we just...

27:14.259 --> 27:16.260
change her name like the Kraut said?

27:16.261 --> 27:18.597
Then she wouldn't be Minna.

27:20.932 --> 27:23.202
And you wouldn't be you.

27:26.571 --> 27:29.208
I wouldn't mind not being me.

27:31.710 --> 27:32.910
Dex.

27:32.911 --> 27:34.412
Your lunch was getting cold.

27:34.413 --> 27:36.314
I'm not hungry, Colleen, thanks.

27:36.315 --> 27:37.781
Still, you need to eat.

27:37.782 --> 27:38.817
Take it.

27:40.385 --> 27:43.288
Monroe, this is Colleen Moore.

27:44.155 --> 27:45.524
Thank you.

27:49.394 --> 27:51.329
Are you from Dublin, Miss Moore?

27:51.330 --> 27:53.764
Rathgar. Do you know Ireland?

27:53.765 --> 27:55.734
I used to.

27:57.402 --> 27:58.936
Do you need anything else, Dex?

27:58.937 --> 28:00.839
Uh, grand.

28:08.613 --> 28:12.784
Listen, Dex, take a couple of days off.

28:14.286 --> 28:15.886
I have a Western you can look at.

28:15.887 --> 28:16.920
Monroe?

28:16.921 --> 28:17.921
Yeah.

28:21.393 --> 28:23.428
I could do with a fiver.

28:45.617 --> 28:48.586
You sure there's nothing
I can get for you, Mrs. Brady?

28:48.587 --> 28:50.688
Oh, no. Thank you. Birdy.

28:50.689 --> 28:52.523
You think he'll be much longer?

28:52.524 --> 28:53.791
I wish I could say.

28:53.792 --> 28:55.559
He doesn't check in with me often enough

28:55.560 --> 28:56.860
when he's off the lot,

28:56.861 --> 28:58.596
and you know how these
finance meetings can go.

28:58.597 --> 29:00.130
How much does he pay you, Birdy?

29:00.131 --> 29:02.334
$40 a week.

29:03.868 --> 29:05.704
You should ask for more.

29:42.641 --> 29:44.942
Would you get me some candy?

29:44.943 --> 29:46.545
You bet.

29:56.087 --> 29:59.424
I love you.

30:19.110 --> 30:20.544
Ladies and gentlemen,

30:20.545 --> 30:23.781
please welcome the Blue Bonnets.

30:35.660 --> 30:37.861
Monroe, I just heard the funniest gag.

30:37.862 --> 30:40.399
Three guys walk into a... No, wait.

31:58.643 --> 32:00.210
You know, the thing about Monroe

32:00.211 --> 32:01.845
is he's broken in a way.

32:01.846 --> 32:04.815
He believes in things
that don't even exist anymore.

32:04.816 --> 32:07.985
And I want you to forget about him.

32:07.986 --> 32:09.953
You don't really know him, Daddy.

32:09.954 --> 32:12.790
Know him? Who do you think named him?

32:12.791 --> 32:14.958
He was running a circus
when I found him.

32:14.959 --> 32:19.162
Milton Sternberg, 19, from the Bronx.

32:19.163 --> 32:20.664
I invented him.

32:20.665 --> 32:23.300
I think he's heroic.

32:23.301 --> 32:25.402
Oh, Jesus.

32:25.403 --> 32:27.070
That's why I'm paying for Bennington:

32:27.071 --> 32:28.371
so you can fall for a guy

32:28.372 --> 32:29.673
whose parents came over in steerage.

32:29.674 --> 32:31.509
Find a lawyer. Find a doctor...

32:31.510 --> 32:33.577
I don't want a country club life.

32:33.578 --> 32:35.245
I want this.
No.

32:35.246 --> 32:37.047
And I want...
Please.

32:37.048 --> 32:38.682
Anything but this.

32:38.683 --> 32:40.350
That would kill me.

32:40.351 --> 32:42.053
And I want him.

32:43.822 --> 32:45.756
I know he's not perfect.

32:45.757 --> 32:48.125
I know he's broken inside,

32:48.126 --> 32:49.493
but I can fix all that.

32:49.494 --> 32:52.530
He's not just broken, Celia. He's dying.

32:52.531 --> 32:55.198
He's got a congenital
defect in his aorta.

32:55.199 --> 32:56.834
It's inoperable.

32:56.835 --> 32:59.837
One of these days,
his heart's just going to explode.

32:59.838 --> 33:01.171
I'm sorry.

33:01.172 --> 33:02.573
I know about that.

33:02.574 --> 33:04.675
Everybody does.

33:04.676 --> 33:06.877
Why do you think he's
always in such a rush

33:06.878 --> 33:09.047
to make that one perfect picture?

33:11.149 --> 33:14.018
I think it just makes him more heroic.

33:47.418 --> 33:48.753
Ohh.

33:54.525 --> 33:57.527
Make this much fuss over a picture.

33:57.528 --> 33:59.730
It ought to be Grand Hotel.

33:59.731 --> 34:02.332
This was better than Grand Hotel!

34:02.333 --> 34:06.136
Fine.
Now zip up your fly and clean this mess.

34:06.137 --> 34:08.071
This is Mr. Brady's set.

34:08.072 --> 34:09.639
It's my set!

34:09.641 --> 34:11.242
I wrote it!

34:14.713 --> 34:17.047
Get down here, you boozy mick.

34:20.083 --> 34:21.252
Okay.

34:51.750 --> 34:53.952
Fucking disgrace you are.

35:00.591 --> 35:02.727
We will notify his wife.

35:04.896 --> 35:07.330
I suppose she will be by later

35:07.331 --> 35:08.767
to collect his things.

35:23.447 --> 35:25.016
You must be Sally.

35:28.787 --> 35:30.520
He doesn't want to be disturbed.

35:30.521 --> 35:31.989
Who does?

35:31.990 --> 35:33.191
Mm.

35:34.292 --> 35:36.027
Oh.
Christ.

35:36.928 --> 35:38.930
They don't knock in the Bronx?

35:39.898 --> 35:41.299
Let me guess.

35:42.466 --> 35:44.234
Sally Sweet's mom.

35:44.235 --> 35:45.535
Manager.

35:45.536 --> 35:47.637
I don't fuck people's mothers.

35:47.638 --> 35:49.172
Something I can do for you?

35:49.173 --> 35:50.875
Dex Davis is dead.

35:52.343 --> 35:54.679
Threw himself off a catwalk last night.

35:56.347 --> 35:58.749
What are you looking at me for?
I didn't push him.

35:58.750 --> 35:59.883
Didn't you?
I gave him a job

35:59.884 --> 36:01.651
when no one else would touch him,

36:01.652 --> 36:03.353
which is more than
anybody's brother-in-law

36:03.354 --> 36:04.521
had the right to expect.

36:04.522 --> 36:06.323
The hand-holding I leave to you.

36:06.324 --> 36:07.357
You're all heart.

36:07.358 --> 36:08.658
Yeah, well,

36:08.659 --> 36:10.460
I'm not trying to become a legend,
Monroe.

36:10.461 --> 36:11.862
I'm just trying to survive.

36:11.863 --> 36:14.597
So the world can get its
first taste of Sally Sweet?

36:14.598 --> 36:16.266
That's right. For two hours,

36:16.267 --> 36:18.635
we can make people laugh,
sing, and forget.

36:18.636 --> 36:19.803
That's our job.

36:19.804 --> 36:22.439
This picture mattered to him, Pat.

36:22.440 --> 36:24.041
It mattered to me.

36:24.042 --> 36:25.909
A little compromise on your part,

36:25.910 --> 36:27.378
and we'd still be shooting.

36:32.616 --> 36:35.919
Carol de Paris, Monroe Stahr.

36:35.920 --> 36:38.455
It's very nice to meet you.
Please forgive the...

36:38.456 --> 36:40.390
Make sure you give her a dog.

36:40.391 --> 36:41.459
Who?

36:42.626 --> 36:45.228
America's sweetheart out there.

36:45.229 --> 36:47.866
People love a kid who loves her dog.

36:53.137 --> 36:54.305
He's right.

36:59.177 --> 37:02.045
I remember his first day on the lot.

37:02.046 --> 37:05.382
Yeah. His Traveling Salesman script.

37:05.383 --> 37:07.684
It was supposed to be a Bill Powell,
wasn't it?

37:07.685 --> 37:09.087
Eddie Cantor.

37:14.258 --> 37:15.894
He was happy then.

37:19.130 --> 37:20.231
Giddy.

37:22.801 --> 37:24.969
First day on the lot.

37:52.363 --> 37:54.132
I could do with a fiver.

38:24.362 --> 38:26.130
Sad day, Bess.

38:27.531 --> 38:28.967
The worst.

38:31.135 --> 38:33.171
It was such a great part.

38:43.281 --> 38:46.249
How long has it been
since your last confession?

38:46.250 --> 38:49.419
This is my first, Father.

38:49.420 --> 38:53.156
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm not of your faith.

38:53.157 --> 38:56.494
This place mattered to
someone who mattered to me.

38:58.796 --> 39:00.564
I have nowhere else to go.

39:01.933 --> 39:03.834
I see.

39:04.936 --> 39:07.337
Do you like to go to the pictures,
Father?

39:07.338 --> 39:09.040
I suppose.

39:10.708 --> 39:12.842
Do you think they matter?

39:12.843 --> 39:16.080
Not especially, no.

39:19.117 --> 39:22.353
Someone just died trying
to make one for me.

39:24.288 --> 39:25.688
Died?

39:25.689 --> 39:27.358
He trusted me, and I...

39:28.792 --> 39:29.927
Done.

39:29.928 --> 39:31.995
All day long, I convince people

39:31.996 --> 39:33.596
that I know better than they do

39:33.597 --> 39:35.033
what's best for them.

39:36.700 --> 39:38.835
I guess it's your job, too.

39:38.836 --> 39:41.038
Maybe a hundred times a day,

39:41.039 --> 39:42.439
I take someone to the edge of a roof,

39:42.440 --> 39:44.507
and I say "Don't worry. You can jump.

39:44.508 --> 39:47.744
There's water down there. Trust me."

39:47.745 --> 39:49.179
Not "I think this will work."

39:49.180 --> 39:51.414
I have to be certain,
or it all falls apart.

39:51.415 --> 39:52.550
I have to know.

39:55.886 --> 39:58.056
But I don't always know.

40:00.324 --> 40:02.425
And there isn't always water down there.

40:02.426 --> 40:04.895
Sometimes there's just pavement.

40:06.197 --> 40:08.565
Which means I've lied to them.

40:08.566 --> 40:11.402
I lie a lot, Father.

40:12.670 --> 40:14.438
Can you stop?

40:15.974 --> 40:17.675
Can you find another way?

40:19.577 --> 40:21.212
No.

40:22.680 --> 40:24.648
It's how pictures get made.

40:27.851 --> 40:29.687
And they're all I've got.

40:31.655 --> 40:33.591
I can't feel anything else.

40:35.826 --> 40:37.996
And I'm running out of time.

40:47.571 --> 40:50.574
Do you have a prayer
that can fix all that?

41:07.491 --> 41:09.892
You make a fine hedge, Celia.

41:09.893 --> 41:11.561
I'd make an even better producer.

41:11.562 --> 41:14.264
If you don't like bandleader stories,
I have one about...

41:14.265 --> 41:15.732
Please, no pitches.

41:15.733 --> 41:17.234
Not from you.

41:17.235 --> 41:20.970
Then take me to the Screen
Writers Ball tonight?

41:20.971 --> 41:23.640
Celia, why waste yourself on me?

41:23.641 --> 41:25.108
Pictures are my girl.

41:25.109 --> 41:26.843
It would be like marrying a doctor.

41:26.844 --> 41:29.079
Well, I love my doctor.

41:29.080 --> 41:31.314
He's sexy.

41:31.315 --> 41:33.050
You ever read Dante?

41:33.051 --> 41:36.286
In high school, a hundred years ago.

41:36.287 --> 41:37.587
Well, then you should know.

41:37.588 --> 41:39.522
There's a special circle of hell

41:39.523 --> 41:41.858
reserved for drunkards, bad comics,

41:41.859 --> 41:46.329
and anyone dumb enough to date his boss'
daughter.

41:46.330 --> 41:47.998
Monroe.

41:50.468 --> 41:53.670
If I weren't my father's daughter,

41:53.671 --> 41:55.373
would you go with me?

42:06.016 --> 42:08.186
I'd be the luckiest man there.

42:13.957 --> 42:16.094
Luckiest man there.

42:19.663 --> 42:20.930
Hey, Monroe.

42:20.931 --> 42:22.265
Mr. Brady's office.

42:22.266 --> 42:24.967
What time would the governor like to...

42:24.968 --> 42:26.803
I have a lot of work to do.

42:26.804 --> 42:27.804
Good.

42:34.712 --> 42:35.878
What's this?

42:35.879 --> 42:37.914
Blank check.

42:37.915 --> 42:40.518
The next picture you make,
whatever you want.

42:41.419 --> 42:43.520
With no interference from me.

42:43.521 --> 42:44.821
Or anybody.

42:44.822 --> 42:47.724
As long as it's not
about the Reichstag fire

42:47.725 --> 42:49.526
or my wife?

42:49.527 --> 42:51.994
You know how I hate to part with money,
Monroe.

42:51.995 --> 42:54.197
Don't make me offer this twice.

42:54.198 --> 42:56.467
You trying to buy my trust back?

42:57.701 --> 42:59.136
Gun to your head.

42:59.137 --> 43:00.970
And it'll never leave this room.

43:00.971 --> 43:03.606
You know that Sally Sweet
will make us money, don't you?

43:03.607 --> 43:05.575
Just like you know that
no studio is rich enough

43:05.576 --> 43:07.710
to cut off a revenue stream
the size of Germany.

43:07.711 --> 43:10.880
So maybe we can just get back to work,
huh?

43:10.881 --> 43:13.049
For the sake of
the thousands of employees

43:13.050 --> 43:16.487
who are relying on us
for our sound governance.

43:17.721 --> 43:18.955
I always said you were

43:18.956 --> 43:20.724
the smartest guy on the lot, Pat.

43:22.092 --> 43:23.794
Fat bit of good it does me.

43:35.105 --> 43:36.773
Then there was that pirate picture.

43:36.774 --> 43:38.875
You put him through ten drafts
and still didn't make it.

43:38.876 --> 43:41.110
I thought something was there.
It wasn't.

43:41.111 --> 43:42.179
My mistake.

43:42.180 --> 43:43.646
Yeah, and the Broadway picture.

43:43.647 --> 43:45.415
You had ten of us writing behind him,

43:45.416 --> 43:47.184
and you didn't make that one, either.

43:47.185 --> 43:48.418
Just because you make a script better

43:48.419 --> 43:49.619
doesn't mean you made it good.

43:49.620 --> 43:50.987
Dex knew that.

43:50.988 --> 43:53.256
Dex just heard no too many times.

43:53.257 --> 43:54.457
Christ, we all have.

43:54.458 --> 43:55.792
It's a wonder he was alone up there.

43:55.793 --> 43:58.595
"No" is supposed to make
you work harder, George.

43:58.596 --> 44:01.498
"No" is what keeps us
from embarrassing ourselves.

44:01.499 --> 44:02.699
You writers get mixed up

44:02.700 --> 44:05.034
because you think
all this is personal...

44:05.035 --> 44:07.069
hating people and worshiping them,

44:07.070 --> 44:08.405
sometimes in the same breath...

44:08.406 --> 44:10.707
and expecting them to worship you.

44:10.708 --> 44:12.775
You just ask to be kicked around.

44:12.776 --> 44:14.178
Hear, hear.

44:15.213 --> 44:16.479
I like people,

44:16.480 --> 44:18.080
and I like them to like me.

44:18.081 --> 44:19.782
But I keep my heart where God put it:

44:19.783 --> 44:20.850
on the inside.

44:20.851 --> 44:22.084
At least you have a heart,

44:22.085 --> 44:23.420
unlike Celia's father.

44:23.421 --> 44:25.688
Not an unkind word about him, George,

44:25.689 --> 44:26.856
ever.

44:26.857 --> 44:28.925
Not in front of me.

44:28.926 --> 44:30.159
Didn't you like your meal?

44:30.160 --> 44:31.961
Monroe doesn't eat during the week.

44:31.962 --> 44:34.464
he likes the feeling
he gets from being hungry.

44:34.465 --> 44:36.165
It gives him an edge.

44:36.166 --> 44:38.868
Doesn't smoke, either, or dance.

44:38.869 --> 44:40.170
Do you, Golden Boy?

44:41.372 --> 44:43.473
That's a lovely dress, Celia.

44:43.474 --> 44:45.107
You should see what it looks like

44:45.108 --> 44:46.676
in a ball on the floor.

44:49.947 --> 44:51.514
Why so shocked, Monroe?

44:51.515 --> 44:54.285
Bennington's not a convent.

45:04.228 --> 45:05.929
Is he as drunk as he looks?

45:12.069 --> 45:14.304
Landon, you sly dog.

45:14.305 --> 45:15.472
Don't be too impressed.

45:15.473 --> 45:16.706
She only said yes

45:16.707 --> 45:19.577
because it's a memorial for Dex.

45:20.878 --> 45:22.011
Miss Moore.

45:22.012 --> 45:24.548
Mr. Stahr.

45:27.918 --> 45:29.720
Good Christ.

45:33.123 --> 45:35.224
Maybe some coffee.

45:35.225 --> 45:37.227
Would you care to dance first?

45:40.564 --> 45:42.400
That would be nice.

45:48.005 --> 45:50.139
I'll be damned.

45:50.140 --> 45:53.510
Sorry about Landon.

45:53.511 --> 45:55.546
I imagine he was just a bit overwhelmed.

45:58.282 --> 46:00.684
By day he seems so tame.

46:08.859 --> 46:12.094
You know his father was a carpenter.

46:12.095 --> 46:14.464
Tell me, how is it

46:14.465 --> 46:16.499
you see all these writers
and producers every day

46:16.500 --> 46:18.969
and no one's ever asked you
to come read for something?

46:20.538 --> 46:22.472
A face like yours

46:22.473 --> 46:25.443
makes me think I should
fire the whole bunch.

46:27.177 --> 46:29.045
Well, they've asked.

46:29.046 --> 46:31.581
A few times.

46:31.582 --> 46:34.684
I just don't have any interest.

46:34.685 --> 46:35.852
In acting?

46:35.853 --> 46:38.120
In any of it.

46:38.121 --> 46:40.256
It's sort of an unsavory business,

46:40.257 --> 46:42.359
if you forgive my saying it.

46:42.360 --> 46:45.428
It hardly matters.
I'm leaving next week.

46:45.429 --> 46:46.863
To go where?

46:46.864 --> 46:47.998
Home.

46:49.567 --> 46:51.368
Why?

46:51.369 --> 46:53.336
I guess I finally realized

46:53.337 --> 46:55.805
this place isn't like the movies at all.

46:55.806 --> 46:57.708
It's just where they're made.

47:01.779 --> 47:04.681
I don't think I ever fit in here.

47:04.682 --> 47:06.849
Maybe I didn't try.

47:06.850 --> 47:10.286
A whole year, and I never
even found a church to go to.

47:10.287 --> 47:12.623
Funny, I happen to know one.

47:16.126 --> 47:17.994
They talk about you, you know.

47:17.995 --> 47:21.364
All of them, all the time.

47:21.365 --> 47:24.667
What do they say?

47:24.668 --> 47:27.670
That nothing's ever good enough for you.

47:27.671 --> 47:30.007
That you're never happy with anything.

47:31.442 --> 47:32.910
That's true.

47:34.311 --> 47:37.448
Well, it was.

47:38.315 --> 47:39.517
Till when?

47:42.420 --> 47:43.853
About five minutes ago.

47:48.692 --> 47:49.993
Monroe.

47:51.495 --> 47:52.996
Bernadette.

47:57.334 --> 47:59.168
That's for my husband.

47:59.169 --> 48:00.671
For Dex.

48:01.739 --> 48:02.939
You knew

48:02.940 --> 48:05.207
he was putting that garbage
into his veins,

48:05.208 --> 48:06.544
didn't you?

48:08.111 --> 48:10.581
But you had your script.

48:13.250 --> 48:15.052
And now he's dead.

48:16.887 --> 48:18.388
Just like Minna.

48:21.625 --> 48:24.662
Everyone who comes close
to you pays for it.

48:26.229 --> 48:27.498
Don't they?

48:32.369 --> 48:33.904
Mrs. Davis.

49:08.171 --> 49:09.806
Hey.

49:09.807 --> 49:10.674
Here.

49:10.675 --> 49:11.808
What about you?

49:11.809 --> 49:13.777
I had three or four on the way.

49:31.394 --> 49:32.996
There's Mr. Brady.

49:54.217 --> 49:55.485
Do you see it?

50:08.031 --> 50:09.099
Hey, let's...

50:10.433 --> 50:12.570
Let's collect it.

50:14.071 --> 50:16.974
How much is it?
Stay here. Stay here.

50:24.247 --> 50:25.347
Don't you want any of...

50:25.348 --> 50:27.817
I need a job, Mister.

50:27.818 --> 50:30.386
You got one of those
in that hat of yours?

50:30.387 --> 50:32.855
Do you know who I am?

50:32.856 --> 50:35.793
Yeah. You know who I am?

50:38.195 --> 50:39.662
Got a driver's license?

50:39.663 --> 50:42.198
An Oklahoma one, yeah.

50:42.199 --> 50:45.002
Okie. Christ.

50:46.103 --> 50:48.705
Come by the lot the first of the month.

50:48.706 --> 50:50.973
Ask for a man named Zepp.

50:50.974 --> 50:52.241
You are?

50:52.242 --> 50:54.711
Max Miner from Oklahoma.

50:54.712 --> 50:58.080
Miner, if any of these people ask,

50:58.081 --> 51:01.050
I told you to screw off, understand?

51:04.087 --> 51:05.188
Yes, sir.

51:21.772 --> 51:24.007
She didn't leave a glass slipper?

51:25.308 --> 51:27.043
No.

51:27.044 --> 51:29.979
Monroe, I know what story
I need to tell you, but just...

51:29.980 --> 51:31.681
Celia, please, not now.
I want to do a movie

51:31.682 --> 51:34.083
about the Nazis right now.
Don't you read Variety?

51:34.084 --> 51:35.685
The Fuhrer runs Hollywood now.

51:35.686 --> 51:37.787
Just ask Dex Davis.
Let me finish!

51:37.788 --> 51:39.990
Gosh sakes, Monroe!

51:45.595 --> 51:47.196
There's a spy ring.

51:47.197 --> 51:49.966
Foreign agents loyal to the Fatherland

51:49.967 --> 51:52.234
operating in the middle of Manhattan.

51:52.235 --> 51:54.303
Espionage, that sort of thing.

51:54.304 --> 51:55.972
A woman begins to suspect

51:55.973 --> 51:58.574
that it's all being run from
the apartment next to hers...

51:58.575 --> 52:01.177
an old man she's always hated
because he was mean to her cats.

52:01.178 --> 52:05.147
She goes to the FBI,
but they laugh her out of the office,

52:05.148 --> 52:09.318
so she eavesdrops on him
through the radiator.

52:09.319 --> 52:10.853
Turns out she was right.

52:10.854 --> 52:12.088
They are foreign spies

52:12.089 --> 52:13.555
about to assassinate the President.

52:13.556 --> 52:15.224
So she goes back to the FBI,

52:15.225 --> 52:17.459
and one agent decides she isn't crazy.

52:17.460 --> 52:20.096
They start to work together.
They even fall in love.

52:20.097 --> 52:22.331
But then they...
Celia, stop.

52:22.332 --> 52:24.301
I can't make that movie.

52:25.769 --> 52:27.636
I can't even say the word "Nazi"

52:27.637 --> 52:28.871
in a movie anymore.

52:28.872 --> 52:31.073
But don't you see?

52:31.074 --> 52:32.909
You wouldn't be saying it at all.

52:32.910 --> 52:34.143
That's the point.

52:34.144 --> 52:36.946
These spies are from
a fictional country.

52:36.947 --> 52:40.382
It's totalitarian, murderous.

52:40.383 --> 52:42.051
But we don't call it Germany.

52:42.052 --> 52:45.822
So the only way Gyssling could
complain it's about the Nazis

52:45.823 --> 52:47.656
Is to admit they behave the same way.

52:47.657 --> 52:50.060
And he can't.

52:53.463 --> 52:54.932
Monroe.

52:56.233 --> 52:57.768
We call it Birnel.

52:58.802 --> 53:00.803
The country. Birnel.

53:00.804 --> 53:02.471
It's Berlin with...

53:02.472 --> 53:03.773
With the letters mixed up.

53:03.774 --> 53:06.009
That's wonderful.

53:08.411 --> 53:10.512
So you like it?

53:10.513 --> 53:11.948
You want a story credit?

53:11.949 --> 53:13.783
I want to produce it.

53:13.784 --> 53:15.184
One thing at a time, darling.

53:15.185 --> 53:17.354
You still have a few
things to learn yet.

53:18.588 --> 53:20.289
Aubrey should write this.

53:20.290 --> 53:21.958
Aubrey loves me.

53:21.959 --> 53:23.260
Why wouldn't he?

53:24.627 --> 53:26.562
Type up some pages for him to look at.

53:26.563 --> 53:28.265
We'll start there, all right?

53:34.504 --> 53:36.272
But no more talk about your dress

53:36.273 --> 53:38.475
wadded up in a ball on the floor.

53:44.915 --> 53:46.449
This is business.

54:01.231 --> 54:04.000
Hi. Where are you off to, honey?

54:04.001 --> 54:05.634
Daddy, I've decided something.

54:05.635 --> 54:07.805
I'm not going back to Bennington.

54:08.806 --> 54:10.773
I see.
You were right.

54:10.774 --> 54:11.974
Why pay all that money

54:11.975 --> 54:13.475
when everything I want is here?

54:13.476 --> 54:14.643
Hmm.

54:14.644 --> 54:16.545
And what's that?

54:16.546 --> 54:18.982
Monroe.

54:20.383 --> 54:22.051
He just hired me.

54:22.052 --> 54:23.719
What are you talking about?

54:23.720 --> 54:26.488
I pitched him a story.
He wants me to produce it.

54:26.489 --> 54:27.857
That son of a bitch.

54:27.858 --> 54:30.126
I'm going to marry him, Daddy,

54:30.127 --> 54:32.594
and help him make
that one perfect picture

54:32.595 --> 54:34.031
before he...
Rose.

54:36.233 --> 54:39.269
I think you are the smartest
person on that lot.

54:41.638 --> 54:43.405
But it's an ugly lot.

54:43.406 --> 54:45.407
It's an ugly world.

54:45.408 --> 54:47.676
But we're going to shine a light on it,

54:47.677 --> 54:49.311
Monroe and I,

54:49.312 --> 54:50.981
while he still can.

54:52.615 --> 54:54.084
See you at work.

54:55.252 --> 54:56.419
Rose.

55:12.769 --> 55:14.571
We never did finish that dance.

55:16.239 --> 55:17.974
No. We didn't.

55:17.975 --> 55:21.043
I'm sorry about that
scene with Bernadette.

55:21.044 --> 55:22.311
Did it drive you away?

55:22.312 --> 55:24.680
It just reminded me why I'm leaving.

55:24.681 --> 55:26.916
Giving in my notice today.

55:26.917 --> 55:31.087
Miss Moore, I don't know you very well,

55:31.088 --> 55:35.557
and I have no right to ask this,

55:35.558 --> 55:36.993
but it'd mean a lot to me

55:36.994 --> 55:38.995
if you just hold off for a moment

55:38.996 --> 55:40.230
before you do that.

55:42.900 --> 55:44.700
Why?
Well, for one thing,

55:44.701 --> 55:47.270
the rest of the waitresses
in this place are terrible.

55:49.472 --> 55:50.373
One day.

55:50.374 --> 55:52.141
Then if you still want to go,

55:52.142 --> 55:53.944
I'll buy you the ticket myself.

55:55.478 --> 55:59.381
It's not just that I
remind you of someone else.

55:59.382 --> 56:00.951
Oh, yes.

56:02.685 --> 56:05.155
But also that you called me on it.

56:06.623 --> 56:07.857
Please.

56:08.825 --> 56:10.527
I hate sad endings.

56:12.395 --> 56:14.464
And they are playing our song.

56:16.233 --> 56:17.968
You picture people.

56:20.370 --> 56:23.406
You tell these beautiful stories.

56:24.841 --> 56:29.211
They're not all beautiful. Are they?

56:29.212 --> 56:31.180
No.

56:31.181 --> 56:33.450
That's why we do rewrites.

56:38.255 --> 56:40.023
Mr. Stahr's office.

56:41.024 --> 56:42.791
Birnel, huh?

56:42.792 --> 56:44.561
It was Celia's idea.

56:47.030 --> 56:49.165
And, Aubrey,

56:49.166 --> 56:51.367
make them monsters.

56:51.368 --> 56:52.936
Happy to.

57:03.246 --> 57:04.347
Mary.

57:05.582 --> 57:07.284
I have something for you.

57:17.394 --> 57:19.329
I don't know what to say. It's...

57:21.664 --> 57:22.932
Thank you.

57:24.134 --> 57:26.768
Some things exist just to be beautiful.

57:26.769 --> 57:30.107
They don't have to make
any more sense than that.

57:33.210 --> 57:35.611
Should I send Dr. Gyssling in?

57:35.612 --> 57:37.946
Let him wait.

57:37.947 --> 57:40.083
We have movies to make.

57:47.024 --> 57:49.025
Hey!

57:49.026 --> 57:51.627
Sternberg, you resent me, that's fine,

57:51.628 --> 57:53.295
but why drag my family into it?

57:53.296 --> 57:55.197
You made my daughter a producer?

57:55.198 --> 57:57.933
Why don't you just shove
a hot poker up my ass?

57:57.934 --> 57:59.501
Now she'll never straighten out.

57:59.502 --> 58:00.869
She's talented, Pat.

58:00.870 --> 58:02.171
Must be in her genes.

58:02.172 --> 58:03.905
You stay out of her genes, you hear me?

58:03.906 --> 58:05.407
I'm the king here,

58:05.408 --> 58:07.009
and what I say doesn't live dies.

58:07.010 --> 58:09.711
Maybe. But I'm making her movie.

58:09.712 --> 58:11.480
Oh, yeah? With whose money?

58:11.481 --> 58:14.716
Yours. Courtesy of that blank check.

58:14.717 --> 58:18.420
I'm cashing it,
unless I can't trust you after all.

58:18.421 --> 58:21.957
Sometimes I think I'm actually
the one with scruples.

58:21.958 --> 58:23.625
The movie's the baby, Pat.

58:23.626 --> 58:25.362
