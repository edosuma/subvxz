13:25.638 --> 13:27.348
-one day at a time.
-[Dede] Good for you.

13:27.431 --> 13:28.599
Gee, with a voice like yours,

13:28.682 --> 13:30.684
you should be on Broadway,
not in politics.

13:30.768 --> 13:34.230
[chuckles] Although,
and this might be the martini talking,

13:34.688 --> 13:36.148
you ran a hell of a campaign.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.525
-You're good, kid.
-Thanks.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.861
I know I don't need to say it,
considering your track record,

13:40.945 --> 13:42.363
but so are you.

13:42.822 --> 13:43.823
Both of you. Really.

13:44.573 --> 13:46.200
It's-- It's sad that someone has to lose.

13:46.283 --> 13:47.326
He's bullshitting.

13:47.409 --> 13:50.162
-You love the idea of beating us.
-Sometimes.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.122
-Uh-uh--
-Okay, most of the time.

13:52.581 --> 13:54.667
But, seriously, you guys fought
for progressive causes

just assume were always there.

13:56.502 --> 13:57.962
You know, abortion rights,

13:58.045 --> 13:59.630

13:59.713 --> 14:00.840
We stand on your shoulders.

14:00.923 --> 14:03.175
Yeah, while you drive us into the grave.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.718
You did with progressives before you.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.637
Well, experience matters, you know?

-[Hadassah] Mmm.

14:22.194 --> 14:23.821

I do want you to know,
I had my limits, okay?

14:41.630 --> 14:44.341
A member of my staff leaked all that stuff
about the throuple

14:44.425 --> 14:46.343
and-- and you and William.

14:46.427 --> 14:47.803
I-- I had him fired for it.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.805
Thank you for saying so, but, uh...

14:50.264 --> 14:52.266
actually, you should rehire him.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.519
No, I would have advised you
to release that stuff.

14:55.603 --> 14:56.645
We're big girls.

We know this isn't tiddlywinks.

[Hadassah]
And it all ended up for the best anyway.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.736
Although, I am a little more tired
than I used to be.

15:04.403 --> 15:05.988
William is insatiable.

15:08.115 --> 15:10.826
So, what are you gonna do
if you win, Payton? Um...

15:10.910 --> 15:11.869
First hundred days?

15:12.244 --> 15:14.914
Mmm, re-start the conversation
about building a seawall

15:14.997 --> 15:16.999
to protect Lower Manhattan
from the next superstorm.

15:17.082 --> 15:17.958
Never gonna happen.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.585
Those tightwads in appropriations,

15:19.668 --> 15:22.296
they won't give you ten cents
for a paper clip

15:22.379 --> 15:24.006
if they think it's gonna help Manhattan.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.759
I know, I know. I--
I don't think it's ever gonna get built.

15:26.842 --> 15:29.762
I just think it's gonna help curry favor
with the local construction union,

15:29.845 --> 15:31.680
which will increase my voting bloc

15:31.764 --> 15:33.557
enough to solidify my reelection chances.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.100
And it's gonna move the goalposts

15:35.184 --> 15:37.394
as far as what they're willing to spend
on climate issues,

15:37.478 --> 15:38.854
so when I propose that we subsidize

15:38.938 --> 15:40.606
solar panels
for all the downtown buildings,

15:40.689 --> 15:42.733
that $200 billion
is gonna make the 50 million

15:42.816 --> 15:44.860
that the paneling costs
sound like a bargain.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.280
Maybe I won't get as chewed up
as you think I will.

15:48.364 --> 15:51.075
Payton, people are asking
for you to do another song.

15:56.413 --> 15:57.373
Excuse me, ladies.

15:59.750 --> 16:00.668
You know,

16:01.210 --> 16:03.712
they say that you learn more
from your enemies

16:04.296 --> 16:05.714
than you do from your friends.

16:06.340 --> 16:09.426
So, I would like to dedicate
this next song to two women, who...

16:10.344 --> 16:11.303
other than my mother,

16:11.387 --> 16:14.723
have done more to make a man out of me
than anyone else in the world.

I'd like to say a few words.

21:12.312 --> 21:14.273
See, when you're a politician,

21:14.356 --> 21:16.566
you develop a kind of, um...

21:17.442 --> 21:18.485
bionic listening.

21:19.027 --> 21:21.655
You have to hear what no one else does.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.950
You have to hear
what your constituents want...

21:25.826 --> 21:28.453

21:28.537 --> 21:30.289

at rock paper scissors.

21:53.228 --> 21:56.648
I dig in when I should compromise,

21:56.732 --> 22:00.819

to romance.

22:00.902 --> 22:01.945
[low chuckles in crowd]

22:02.029 --> 22:03.030
[Dede] However...

22:04.072 --> 22:06.450
I am a great listener.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.702
And one of the things
that I've been hearing

22:08.785 --> 22:10.912
over the past few weeks of this campaign

22:10.996 --> 22:13.707
is that young people are angry.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.794
They are angry about income inequality,

22:18.295 --> 22:21.757
wage stagnation, the cost of housing,
and more than anything,

22:21.840 --> 22:22.924
climate change

22:23.008 --> 22:25.844
that will alter the way they relate
to the planet we leave them

22:25.927 --> 22:28.680
because they know that none
of those other things are going to matter

22:28.764 --> 22:30.807
if they don't have a planet to live on.

22:31.266 --> 22:33.185
And most importantly,

22:33.268 --> 22:35.187
they're willing to do something about it.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.565
And one of the other things
that I've been hearing...

22:40.776 --> 22:41.943
is the voice...

22:42.778 --> 22:43.904
of a young man...

22:44.654 --> 22:47.657
who fights diligently
to solve the problems

22:47.741 --> 22:50.952
that these young people
are so angry about.

22:52.079 --> 22:53.872
This election
should not have been this close.

22:54.664 --> 22:55.624
But it was.

22:56.291 --> 22:58.543
So close that we are here
deciding the outcome

22:58.627 --> 23:00.587
with a child's game.

23:01.129 --> 23:05.008
It was so close because young people voted

23:05.884 --> 23:08.011
in larger numbers than ever before,

23:08.095 --> 23:10.055
and some of them for the very first time.

23:10.639 --> 23:11.723
They voted...

23:13.141 --> 23:14.309
because they finally...

23:16.144 --> 23:17.229
had a candidate...

23:18.897 --> 23:20.732
who inspired them.

23:21.858 --> 23:24.111
Who made them believe

23:24.194 --> 23:27.948
that someone
was finally listening to them.

23:29.574 --> 23:30.951
And I'm listening too.

23:33.328 --> 23:35.205
And that is why...

24:44.065 --> 24:47.569
Not right in the legal
or ethical sense, but...

24:48.820 --> 24:49.696
right for you.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.824
[sighs]

24:53.492 --> 24:54.367
I envy you.

24:54.451 --> 24:56.161
'Cause I'm willing to do anything to win?

24:56.244 --> 24:57.537
Because you know who you are.

24:58.246 --> 24:59.164
You know what you want.

25:01.917 --> 25:02.876
You don't?

25:05.295 --> 25:07.923
I think I may wanna go to medical school.

25:08.006 --> 25:09.466
[Payton chuckles softly]

25:10.842 --> 25:11.718
I think...

25:14.971 --> 25:16.097
you'd be a great doctor.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.517
-Maybe I'll become a surgeon.
-Hmm.

25:19.226 --> 25:21.811
I excel at focusing on a single task
for long periods of time.

25:21.895 --> 25:25.190
It's that or start a lifestyle brand,
I haven't decided yet.

25:25.273 --> 25:26.483
-Hmm.
-Either way,

25:26.566 --> 25:28.902
I need to go back to Harvard
and finish school.

25:30.111 --> 25:31.988
I am certain that I love you though.

25:34.908 --> 25:37.369
I don't wanna be your dutiful wife, but...

25:40.789 --> 25:43.166
I do wanna have a family with you.

25:43.667 --> 25:46.044
It just needs to be a little more...

25:46.753 --> 25:50.298
George and Amal
and a little less George and Martha.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.216
[Payton] Hmm.

25:56.596 --> 25:57.514
I want that too.

25:58.974 --> 26:00.809
Come on. Let me buy you dinner?

26:01.893 --> 26:03.144
We'll talk medical schools?

26:03.478 --> 26:05.480
Don't you have to finish
your acceptance speech?

26:06.106 --> 26:07.232
Ah, it can wait.

26:08.066 --> 26:09.192
I think... [sighs]

26:10.652 --> 26:11.820
...we should make tonight...

26:13.446 --> 26:14.322
all about you.

26:20.787 --> 26:22.706
-Come on.
-[laughs] Yeah.

26:27.752 --> 26:30.005
[ringing]

26:31.089 --> 26:31.965
Hello.

26:32.465 --> 26:33.883
-Hello!
-Hi, Georgina.

26:33.967 --> 26:34.884
Hi, Dede.

26:34.968 --> 26:38.013
-Thank you so much for facial timing me.
-Hello.

26:38.096 --> 26:39.973
How's the day drinking going?

26:40.515 --> 26:41.433
Excuse me?

26:41.516 --> 26:43.101
Oh, I didn't mean it as an insult.

26:47.147 --> 26:48.523
How are you, Georgiana?

26:48.607 --> 26:52.110
Are you still basking in the glow
of winning 98 percent of the vote?

26:52.611 --> 26:54.362
I mean, I suppose so.

26:54.904 --> 26:57.991
Running for governor, was--
It was-- It was fun,

26:58.074 --> 27:00.160
but, uh, can you believe

27:00.243 --> 27:04.539
nobody told me that you have to move
to Sacramento for the job?

27:04.623 --> 27:05.874
I mean... [scoffs]

27:06.833 --> 27:08.501
...what is in Sacramento

27:08.585 --> 27:12.297
except for farmland and-- and--
and opioids?

27:12.380 --> 27:15.383
Um, so-- so you're not taking the job?

27:15.467 --> 27:16.885
No, of course I am. I am.

27:16.968 --> 27:18.970
But I-- I'll only be there for a year.

27:19.054 --> 27:22.891
My understanding is that
the governor's term is for four years.

27:22.974 --> 27:24.142
But I've decided...

27:25.310 --> 27:26.770
to run for president.

27:27.812 --> 27:28.855
This cycle.

27:28.938 --> 27:30.440
-Huh?
-Isn't that wonderful?

27:31.066 --> 27:34.235
Uh-huh. What-- What about
all your big plans for California?

27:34.319 --> 27:35.779
What about secession?

27:35.862 --> 27:36.696
Yeah...

27:37.238 --> 27:38.782
well, you know,

27:38.865 --> 27:41.826
I might have been aiming
a little bit high with that one.

27:41.910 --> 27:43.578
And then it struck me.

27:43.662 --> 27:47.374
Why does California
have to leave the country

27:47.457 --> 27:50.168
when the country
could be more like California?

27:50.251 --> 27:53.296
Well, yeah,
but what does that have to do with me?

27:53.380 --> 27:54.255
Well...

27:56.299 --> 27:58.301
I want you to be my vice president.

28:00.845 --> 28:01.680
[Dede] Well--

28:02.430 --> 28:04.933
You are so smart, Dede.

28:05.016 --> 28:08.436
You're so good at all of the--
the governing

28:08.520 --> 28:11.189
and all that stuff
that I really can't be bothered with.

28:11.272 --> 28:13.525
I doubt I would even run
for a second term.

28:13.608 --> 28:15.860
You would be set up to succeed me.

28:18.988 --> 28:20.990
If I said yes, I would--
I would have terms.

28:21.074 --> 28:23.076
I would want to bring
Hadassah Gold with me.

28:23.159 --> 28:25.412
-I would want--
-Oh, of course. I'm way ahead of you.

28:25.495 --> 28:28.039
I was thinking of having her
as my chief of staff.

28:28.123 --> 28:31.376
Her natural dislike of people
makes her perfect for that job.

28:31.960 --> 28:32.961
One question then:

28:34.337 --> 28:35.171
Why me?

28:35.755 --> 28:39.175
Because you and I both know,
you are far from finished.

28:39.968 --> 28:42.011
It's second act time for you.

28:42.095 --> 28:46.141
And politics, yes,
it's mostly ego and-- and marketing,

28:46.224 --> 28:47.642
but-- but the governing...

28:49.769 --> 28:51.229
competency matters...

28:51.646 --> 28:52.814
integrity matters,

28:52.897 --> 28:55.650
expertise matters, experience matters.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.945
The country needs you,

28:59.487 --> 29:00.405
that's why.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.658
An all female ticket.

29:04.701 --> 29:05.952
History-making.

29:07.996 --> 29:09.038
What do you say?

29:10.248 --> 29:12.542
[Infinity]
Because this is the thing about change...

29:13.251 --> 29:14.836
people say that it can't be done,

29:14.919 --> 29:18.798
and then when it is, when you accomplish
the thing that nobody said that you could,

29:18.882 --> 29:21.384
suddenly, those people that stood there,

29:21.468 --> 29:23.428
blocking your path every step of the way,

29:23.511 --> 29:25.221
suddenly, they say that they didn't.

29:25.305 --> 29:29.100
Suddenly, your big idea
was their big idea all along.

29:29.184 --> 29:31.811
So, let's not let that happen.

29:32.145 --> 29:34.856
Let's remind them that they were the ones

29:34.939 --> 29:37.609
-standing in the way of progress...
-[door shuts]

29:37.692 --> 29:39.652
Oh, God, there you are.
I'm not saying any of this.

29:39.736 --> 29:41.946
Okay, I mean,
you can say whatever you want, you won.

29:42.030 --> 29:44.199
No, I didn't win,
that's the problem, I tied.

29:44.282 --> 29:46.826
That makes this speech about
the things I'll do with my big victory

29:46.910 --> 29:49.078
sound stupid, especially
since it's not a victory at all.

29:49.162 --> 29:50.371
But what I'm trying to say is--

29:50.455 --> 29:52.749
Please stop interrupting,
let me finish a fucking thought!

29:52.832 --> 29:54.209
[Infinity continues indistinctly]

29:54.292 --> 29:55.668
I'm sorry, it's just...

29:56.836 --> 30:00.173
the problem is, for someone who has
staked his future on winning elections...

30:02.342 --> 30:04.385
I don't win many elections, do I?

30:04.969 --> 30:06.888
[Infinity]
There are cynics who will tell you that

30:06.971 --> 30:08.473
recycling doesn't make a difference...

30:08.556 --> 30:11.267
Okay, I'm about to say something
that might make you really mad.

30:11.726 --> 30:12.560
But you won.

30:13.186 --> 30:15.438
Jesus Christ.
No, my opponent dropped out, again.

30:15.522 --> 30:17.774
That's the thrust of the point
that I'm attempting to make.

30:17.857 --> 30:19.943
Yeah, no, that's the part
that might make you mad.

30:20.235 --> 30:24.155
We counted the votes in the ballot box...
and you won.

30:24.239 --> 30:26.366
[Infinity] ...leaders will see
the writing on the wall.

30:26.449 --> 30:29.244
[McAfee] James, Skye, and me,
we kind of couldn't stand not knowing...

30:29.327 --> 30:30.203
Payton.

30:31.830 --> 30:32.956
Dede.

30:33.581 --> 30:35.875
Payton. Payton.

30:35.959 --> 30:39.003
All those old people
in the retirement home... [laughs]

30:39.212 --> 30:41.005
...they all went for you, 98 to 75.

30:41.089 --> 30:42.006
[chuckles]

30:42.090 --> 30:43.591
You won the election, Payton.

30:43.675 --> 30:47.554
I mean, it was close, just 23 votes,
but you won, you-- you actually won.

30:47.637 --> 30:48.763
[laughing]

30:48.847 --> 30:50.265
Congratulations, Senator.

30:50.348 --> 30:53.142
State... Senator.
Let's not get carried away.

30:53.226 --> 30:54.394
State Senator Elect!

30:54.477 --> 30:55.812
[laughing] Oh, my God.

30:55.895 --> 30:59.148
[Infinity] Ladies and gentlemen,
Senator Elect Payton Hobart.

30:59.607 --> 31:01.359
-That's me.
-That's you.

31:01.442 --> 31:03.444
[cheers and applause]

31:06.739 --> 31:08.908
[loud cheering]

31:15.123 --> 31:17.000
[Infinity cheers loudly]

31:17.083 --> 31:18.585
[camera shutters clicking]

31:21.629 --> 31:22.881
Thank you. [chuckles]

31:26.467 --> 31:27.468
Thank you.

31:27.552 --> 31:28.803
Wow. [laughs]

31:29.804 --> 31:30.889
Wow, wow, wow.

31:31.139 --> 31:34.475
You know, I have to-- I have to tell you,
I'm very much at a loss for words.

31:34.767 --> 31:36.936
-[woman in crowd] We love you!
-I love you, too.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.187
[crowd chuckles]

31:38.271 --> 31:39.772
I really do. [chuckles]

31:41.316 --> 31:43.443
Listen, a lot of ink was spilled

31:43.902 --> 31:46.946
about how this-- this race
was about generational change.

31:47.030 --> 31:49.490
Right? Older voters versus younger voters,

31:49.574 --> 31:52.160
voters that had never before
in their lives cast a ballot.

31:52.535 --> 31:53.369
But...

31:54.287 --> 31:58.082
looking at our exit polls, I learned a lot
about who my supporters really are.

31:58.166 --> 32:01.002
Young and old,
you trusted me with your support.

32:01.794 --> 32:04.589
It has defied my expectations...

32:05.340 --> 32:06.633
and it has humbled me.

32:08.259 --> 32:11.471
And for anyone out there
who did cast a vote for Dede Standish,

32:11.554 --> 32:12.805
I have three words:

32:14.140 --> 32:16.142
-I get it.
-[applause]

32:16.684 --> 32:17.560
I do.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.982
Dede Standish is a remarkable woman.

32:23.399 --> 32:25.151
She's an outstanding politician

32:25.234 --> 32:28.112
who's done just about as much
as any single person could do

32:28.488 --> 32:30.573
to improve the lives
of her fellow citizens.

32:30.657 --> 32:34.869
Now, she and I
did not always agree on everything.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.955
-[laughter]
-But, uh, I promise you,

32:37.372 --> 32:41.125
I will work every bit as hard as she has
for the last 30 years,

32:41.209 --> 32:44.545
and I promise you that I will take
the trust that you placed in her

32:44.837 --> 32:46.297
and I will guard that trust

32:46.381 --> 32:49.717
for as long as I'm honored
to hold elective office in your name.

32:50.176 --> 32:52.303
[cheering]

32:55.807 --> 32:56.683
Thank you.

33:00.520 --> 33:01.521
[sighs]

33:01.980 --> 33:03.189
There's an old adage

33:03.272 --> 33:06.818
that says that politicians
campaign in poetry

33:07.735 --> 33:08.861
and govern in prose.

33:10.113 --> 33:11.906
So now we are on to the prose part.

33:12.949 --> 33:15.827
The backbreaking work
of standing up to the colossus,

33:16.369 --> 33:19.956
the abomination that is money in politics.

33:20.707 --> 33:23.710
The fire hose of falsehoods
and disinformation

33:24.460 --> 33:26.587
that is trained and ready
to drown out anybody

33:26.671 --> 33:28.756
who dares to challenge a broken system.

33:29.716 --> 33:32.427
The power of the forces
aligned against us...

33:33.678 --> 33:34.637
is daunting.

33:36.180 --> 33:38.391
And the hard work of safeguarding
our natural environment,

33:38.474 --> 33:40.351
rolling back greenhouse gas emissions

33:40.435 --> 33:44.022
and drawing a line in the sand
as to what we will and will not tolerate

33:44.105 --> 33:47.442
when it comes to risking
mankind's future on this planet.

33:47.775 --> 33:50.111
These are all
just about the hardest things

33:50.194 --> 33:52.447
that humankind
has ever asked itself to do.

33:53.364 --> 33:54.240
But...

33:55.616 --> 33:56.868
as I stand here today...

33:58.327 --> 34:01.831
I can honestly tell you
that looking out at the spectrum of voters

34:01.914 --> 34:04.667
who honored me
with their vote in this campaign,

34:05.293 --> 34:07.170
I can tell you from the bottom of my heart

34:07.253 --> 34:09.338
that today I have never been more hopeful

34:10.089 --> 34:14.093
about what a group of people who have
come together with a common cause

34:14.177 --> 34:16.637
can find the strength inside itself to do.

34:17.805 --> 34:21.601
We will meet this challenge
and we will overcome it.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.062
[cheering]

34:24.979 --> 34:26.147
And let me tell you something,

34:26.230 --> 34:29.692
if I ever break that promise to you, there
is something that I need you to do for me:

34:29.776 --> 34:30.693
vote me out!

34:30.777 --> 34:32.403
[cheers and applause]

34:32.487 --> 34:36.282
If I ever become part of the status quo
in Albany, you vote me out.

34:36.365 --> 34:38.576
[cheering continues]

34:38.659 --> 34:41.788
If I ever choose the easy path
over the right one, vote me out!

34:41.871 --> 34:43.372
[cheering]

34:43.456 --> 34:44.457
Pay attention.

34:44.999 --> 34:45.958
Stay engaged.

34:46.292 --> 34:48.044
Give me no choice

34:48.127 --> 34:49.754
but to be the man that I want to be,

34:49.837 --> 34:52.423
the man that I have promised you today
that I will be.

34:53.132 --> 34:54.383
If you can make that promise

34:54.884 --> 34:58.096
then I can promise you there is nothing
we will not accomplish together.

34:58.763 --> 35:02.183
We will transform this city of New York
and we will save this world!

35:02.266 --> 35:03.559
[cheering]

35:03.643 --> 35:06.562
Thank you so much for this honor.
I'm so proud to be your senator!

35:11.400 --> 35:12.443
[mouthing]

35:15.279 --> 35:17.532
-[cheers continue]
-[Alice laughs]

35:26.415 --> 35:27.333
Thank you.

35:27.875 --> 35:29.877
[cheers continue]

35:32.255 --> 35:33.506
[Alice laughs]

35:34.423 --> 35:35.508
Thank you.

35:37.093 --> 35:38.010
Thank you.

35:39.178 --> 35:40.012
Thank you.

35:40.471 --> 35:42.473
[cheers fading]

35:46.602 --> 35:50.022
Okay, our biggest accomplishments
over the last two years, go.

35:50.106 --> 35:52.150
The all-electric city bus fleet.

35:52.775 --> 35:55.903
You co-wrote the bill
requiring every new high-rise in Manhattan

35:55.987 --> 35:58.364
to utilize a combined
heat-and-power source

35:58.447 --> 36:00.700
and incorporate solar panels
into the design.

36:01.742 --> 36:04.787
You added 300 EV charging stations
across the city,

36:04.871 --> 36:08.416
fast-tracked permit approval for
New York's offshore wind operation,

36:08.499 --> 36:11.335
which is now ahead of schedule
and set to deliver 3000 megawatts,

36:11.419 --> 36:14.505
which is almost twice what was promised.

36:14.589 --> 36:16.757
Also, that's 250 new jobs.

36:17.216 --> 36:19.135
Are we talking first-term accomplishments?

36:20.011 --> 36:21.012
I'd vote for Archie.

36:21.095 --> 36:22.722
Ah, all good points.

36:24.056 --> 36:26.517
Okay, okay.
Guys, very happy you're engaged,

36:26.601 --> 36:29.562
but this is still a workplace, so if
we could just... save a little space.

36:29.645 --> 36:31.230
-Thank you very much.
-[door shuts]

36:32.315 --> 36:34.275
-Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.
-[Archie coos]

36:34.358 --> 36:36.152
Hi, sweet boy.

36:36.235 --> 36:38.779
Mommy just took her first board exam.
[laughs]

36:38.863 --> 36:40.573
-How'd it go? How'd it go?
-Yes. Mwah!

36:40.656 --> 36:42.408
I think it went well, but we'll see.

36:42.909 --> 36:46.370
-Archie, Mommy's almost a doctor, yeah!
-Yeah, just like eight more years.

36:46.871 --> 36:49.123
-Eight more years, yeah.
-[Payton and Alice laughing]

36:49.207 --> 36:53.377
Folks, two years ago on election night,
we were shitting ourselves.

36:53.961 --> 36:56.464
Tonight we get to... [grunts]

36:56.547 --> 36:57.506
...sit back...

36:58.216 --> 36:59.425
and celebrate.

37:00.468 --> 37:02.595
Celebrate what? You're running unopposed.

37:02.678 --> 37:04.931
Uh-huh.That's what I mean,
that's what we're celebrating.

37:05.014 --> 37:06.515
We delivered for the 27th District

37:06.599 --> 37:08.684
and now our voters are gonna
send us back to Albany

37:08.768 --> 37:10.603
for two more years to fight for them.

37:11.187 --> 37:12.355
Can I just say something?

37:13.564 --> 37:14.982
This is kind of a huge bummer.

37:15.066 --> 37:16.234
What are you talking about?

37:16.317 --> 37:18.361
I thought you were gonna announce
your next campaign.

37:18.819 --> 37:20.947
Yeah, this was the next campaign. We won!

37:21.989 --> 37:24.242
-Yeah, we won but there wasn't a campaign.
-I agree.

37:24.325 --> 37:26.327
I mean, the champagne's great,
but I thought

37:26.410 --> 37:29.080
maybe you were gonna announce
that you were running for governor.

37:29.163 --> 37:30.164
Seriously?

37:30.248 --> 37:31.207
I guessed Congress.

37:31.290 --> 37:32.833
I thought US Senate.

37:32.917 --> 37:35.253
I thought that's what the lunch
with Chuck Schumer was about.

37:35.336 --> 37:36.170
[Payton] No, no, no.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.798
Okay, I need everyone to really hear this.

37:39.590 --> 37:40.716
The last two years...

37:41.842 --> 37:43.010
have been a revelation.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.136
[Alice chuckles]

37:44.595 --> 37:46.597
Not just because I became
a husband and a father.

37:46.681 --> 37:47.515
[Alice whispers] Yes.

37:47.598 --> 37:51.143
But because I learned
that a meaningful life...

37:52.561 --> 37:54.480
is not all about ambition.

37:55.648 --> 37:57.233
We didn't worry about the next thing.

37:58.192 --> 38:00.069
We stayed devoted
to the thing in front of us.

38:00.903 --> 38:03.823
A cause we believe in and that needs us.

38:04.532 --> 38:05.366
So...

38:06.409 --> 38:07.702
we have a lot more work to do.

38:09.578 --> 38:12.081
-And I for one plan on doing it.
-[chuckles]

38:12.873 --> 38:14.875
That's what I want to celebrate tonight.

38:15.501 --> 38:16.335
So get up here.

38:16.419 --> 38:18.754
[all laugh]

38:19.338 --> 38:20.589
Wanna make a toast?

38:20.673 --> 38:22.383
[Alice] You wanna make a toast? Mmm!

38:22.466 --> 38:23.509
I hear the cutie.

38:23.592 --> 38:24.760
Yes.

38:25.177 --> 38:26.387
[Payton sighs]

38:28.431 --> 38:30.516
To two more years. Cheers.

38:31.851 --> 38:32.685
[Alice] Also,

38:33.060 --> 38:35.688
-your mom's about to be elected president.
-[all chuckle]

38:35.771 --> 38:37.064
And to that as well.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.983
-Cheers.
-[overlapping] Cheers.

38:55.708 --> 38:57.043
[Payton] What are you doing here?

38:57.126 --> 38:58.210
What do you mean?

38:58.294 --> 38:59.754
You don't own Central Park.

39:00.046 --> 39:02.548
I'm jogging. I do it all the time.

39:02.631 --> 39:03.924
[Payton chuckles]

39:05.634 --> 39:08.596
[moaning chuckle]
Wait a minute, hold it, hold it.

39:08.679 --> 39:09.638
Oh, my God.

39:09.972 --> 39:11.974
-Okay, I lied.
-[both laugh]

39:12.058 --> 39:14.810
I don't jog all the time.
In fact, I haven't jogged in 20 years.

39:14.894 --> 39:17.271
Oh, my God, we usually do
that elliptical thing, you know?

39:17.355 --> 39:20.483
The one that tells you
you've run 15 miles, what bullshit.

39:20.566 --> 39:21.567
This is way harder.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.945
There's someone over there
who wants to talk.

39:28.991 --> 39:31.660
I'm going to Sant Ambroeus
for a hot chocolate.

39:31.744 --> 39:32.995
[Payton laughs]

39:35.915 --> 39:37.958
[Payton sniffs, panting]

39:38.918 --> 39:40.002
You could've just called.

39:40.461 --> 39:42.088
[laughs]

39:44.340 --> 39:47.426
-Or spoken to you at the inaugural.
-Mmm.

39:47.510 --> 39:50.471
-But I wanted this to be very private.
-[Payton sighs]

39:51.097 --> 39:52.681
Congratulations on the election...

39:53.641 --> 39:54.683
Madam Vice President.

39:55.267 --> 39:58.145
-Vice President Elect, thank you.
-Ah. [chuckles]

39:58.229 --> 40:02.608
And congratulations to you
on all the spectacular work

40:03.192 --> 40:05.528
you're doing
representing the 27th District.

40:06.195 --> 40:08.656
[scoffs] I-- I was right about you.

40:09.365 --> 40:13.661
Ooh, well, I--
I was wrong about you at first,

40:13.744 --> 40:17.123
but then... I was right about you.

40:18.040 --> 40:21.210
You have accomplished things
that I never could've,

40:21.794 --> 40:25.339
things that I wouldn't have
even thought possible,

40:26.090 --> 40:26.924
quite frankly.

40:27.466 --> 40:29.009
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

40:29.927 --> 40:31.220
I have big shoes to fill.

40:32.304 --> 40:33.514
I'll cut to the chase.

40:34.515 --> 40:36.100
As you know,

40:36.600 --> 40:38.853
your mother made a campaign pledge

40:39.353 --> 40:40.729
to only serve one term,

40:40.813 --> 40:43.274
which paves the way
for me to run in four years.

40:43.357 --> 40:45.860
-You think she's gonna stick to that?
-I know she is.

40:45.943 --> 40:48.112
She is technically
not even the president yet

40:48.195 --> 40:49.572
and she's already bored.

40:49.655 --> 40:51.198
[both laughing]

40:51.574 --> 40:54.535
But the point is I am going to run,

40:54.618 --> 40:58.539
and just like your mother,
I am not interested in some hokey,

40:58.914 --> 41:00.875
fake veepstakes.

41:01.417 --> 41:03.335
I want to know who I'm running with.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.756
And I would like that to be you.

41:11.260 --> 41:12.178
Are you...?

41:13.637 --> 41:15.723
You-- You can't be serious.

41:15.806 --> 41:19.018
I am totally serious.

41:19.101 --> 41:21.353
Well, don't I have to be 35?
I'm not old enough yet.

41:21.437 --> 41:23.439
Well, we're gonna change that.

41:23.522 --> 41:27.067
[sniffs] That's, uh, one of the things...
[chuckles]

41:27.151 --> 41:31.822
...that your mother is pushing
in her first one hundred days, is, uh...

41:32.698 --> 41:36.035
to "let's fix the dumb shit
in the Constitution" campaign.

41:36.118 --> 41:37.828
And she's got all these pop stars

41:37.912 --> 41:40.831
and they're gonna record
a "We Are the World" type of song

41:40.915 --> 41:42.541
and, um, it's catchy.

41:42.625 --> 41:43.792
-[Payton] Mmm.
-Mm-hmm.

41:45.836 --> 41:46.837
I know...

41:48.005 --> 41:50.549
it's a way off, Payton.

41:52.885 --> 41:54.053
But I'm asking.

41:56.222 --> 41:57.139
Will you do it?

41:59.725 --> 42:03.354
Will you be my vice president?

42:06.857 --> 42:08.400
[sputtering chuckle]

42:30.756 --> 42:33.175
[chuckling softly]

42:41.350 --> 42:44.270
[instrumental theme music plays]
