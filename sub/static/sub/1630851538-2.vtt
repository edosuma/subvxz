00:17.308 --> 00:20.353
Once upon a time,
fairy tales were awesome.

00:21.229 --> 00:22.647
We know, you don't believe us.

00:22.731 --> 00:25.859
You think fairy tales are cute
and pink and full of fairies.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.195
-Well, they're not.

00:29.279 --> 00:31.281
-Real fairy tales are scary.

00:33.450 --> 00:36.995
Follow two children
as they venture off into a dark tale.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.496
-A scary tale.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.331
-A strange tale.

00:41.374 --> 00:42.667
-A… Wait a minute.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.335
Are you even old enough for this?

00:44.419 --> 00:47.005
-You really think you can handle it?

00:54.012 --> 00:56.514
Once upon a time,
a young girl and a young boy

00:56.598 --> 00:58.808
were looking for the perfect family,

00:59.559 --> 01:02.020
and they found Mr. and Mrs. Bauer.

01:02.687 --> 01:04.689
-Hello, children.
-Hello.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.525
-So happy to see you.

01:10.153 --> 01:12.864
-Come, let's go inside.

01:15.617 --> 01:19.954
Okay, that guy definitely has a suitcase
full of human heads somewhere.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.623
Yeah, I like him too.

01:21.706 --> 01:25.043
Nonetheless, Hansel and Gretel
sat down with the Bauers

01:25.126 --> 01:27.128
and told them their whole crazy story.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.964
And that's our whole crazy story.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.466
Yeah, crazy!

01:31.549 --> 01:34.844
The Bauers reacted…
as anyone would.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.387
I don't know if you can tell,

01:36.471 --> 01:39.599
but we are definitely not staring
at you two like you're nuts.

01:39.682 --> 01:41.935
No, no, no, not one bit.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.145
-What's wrong with your face?

01:44.229 --> 01:46.147
Hansel!

01:46.231 --> 01:47.899
I'm glad you asked.

01:47.982 --> 01:51.444
You see,
Mr. Bauer has feelings, like everyone.

01:51.528 --> 01:55.448
But sometimes he has trouble showing them,
you know, with his face.

01:56.199 --> 01:59.536
So sometimes
I paint on a nice happy smile.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.412
-Ooh!

02:01.496 --> 02:03.331
See? So cheerful.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.170
Is he gonna lay an egg?

02:09.254 --> 02:12.632
Kids, let me just
lay my cards on the table.

02:12.715 --> 02:16.261
Mrs. Bauer and I
have always wanted a daughter.

02:17.679 --> 02:20.807
-Uh, and you seem good too.

02:21.474 --> 02:24.519
So, the two of you
are welcome in our home.

02:24.602 --> 02:25.520
Thank you.

02:25.603 --> 02:29.566
We'll do whatever it takes to be perfect
children and make this the perfect family.

02:29.649 --> 02:30.984
Fantastic.

02:33.194 --> 02:37.073
I'll fix your supper and we'll ready
a nice warm bath for you both.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.409
-A warm bath?

02:39.492 --> 02:41.703
This is going to be the perfect home.

02:41.786 --> 02:44.205
And we'll live happily ever after!

02:44.289 --> 02:46.833
I know that Baker lady
didn't work out so good.

02:46.916 --> 02:50.295
-Because she tried to eat us?
-Yeah. There was that.

02:50.378 --> 02:54.007
But I'm going to make it up to you now.
Don't these two seem great?

02:54.090 --> 02:56.176
He can't smile
so she paints smiles on him.

02:56.259 --> 02:59.512
Don't be so judgy. It's fine.

02:59.596 --> 03:03.975
Gretel. I'm practically grown up now,
and I have a bad feeling about this.

03:04.058 --> 03:05.602
You can't tie your own shoes.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.937
Yeah, that's why I said "practically."

03:08.021 --> 03:10.440
Well, my good thinking
beats your bad feeling.

03:10.523 --> 03:13.902
And you can keep me safe by helping me
make this the perfect family.

03:13.985 --> 03:15.069
By being a good kid.

03:15.153 --> 03:18.448
By making our new turnip mom
and turnip dad happy.

03:20.366 --> 03:21.826
Yummy turnips.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.250
-This isn't good.
-Ahem.

03:29.834 --> 03:33.880
Hansel and Gretel set out to be the
perfect kids in their new perfect home.

03:33.963 --> 03:38.134
Well, Gretel did.
Hansel was just, eh, Hansel.

03:38.218 --> 03:41.054
-Here's breakfast.

03:41.763 --> 03:45.058
Diced turnips, poached turnips
in a turnip béchamel,

03:45.141 --> 03:47.018
and hash browns.

03:47.101 --> 03:49.437
That are also turnips. Enjoy.

03:49.562 --> 03:50.438
Ugh.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.690
Thank you.

03:52.774 --> 03:55.318
-May I call you Mother?

03:55.401 --> 03:57.862
Of course you can, dear.

03:57.946 --> 04:00.823
Because you are…

04:03.201 --> 04:05.787
…my children.

04:05.870 --> 04:08.581
-Mother?
-It's not breakfast without eggs.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.124
Ugh.

04:10.208 --> 04:13.628
-It smells like feet.
-Shh, shh. Thank you for the food, Mother.

04:13.711 --> 04:16.130
-We are grateful to be your children.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.007
-Mmm!
-Oh!

04:19.801 --> 04:21.803
Mmm!

04:25.390 --> 04:28.142
Blech! Not good at all.

04:28.226 --> 04:30.144
I'm sure you'll grow to like it.

04:31.854 --> 04:34.148
-Good job, Gretel.

04:34.232 --> 04:37.777
But try throwing your
shoulder into it. Like this.

04:39.028 --> 04:40.780
-Got it.

04:40.863 --> 04:42.907
-There you go.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.122
Ha! Hi-ya! Ha!

04:49.205 --> 04:52.166
-Hansel, knock it off!

04:52.250 --> 04:54.919
-I'm sorry. Are you mad?

04:55.003 --> 04:57.171
No, no. That's how I laugh.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.268
This keeps getting more and more not good.

05:10.351 --> 05:13.896
Come on, it's fun. Try it.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.696
Despite his bad feelings,
as the weeks went by,

05:21.779 --> 05:25.033
Hansel started to become
part of the family.

05:43.051 --> 05:43.968
Thank you.

05:47.472 --> 05:50.475
Okay, everyone, smile…

05:50.558 --> 05:52.643
for seven or eight hours.

05:52.727 --> 05:56.898
We also want
two eight-by-tens and six wallet-sized.

05:56.981 --> 05:58.524
More like 16 hours.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.074
Mmm. Mmm.

06:06.157 --> 06:08.701
You were right.
I am starting to like this.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.037
Told you everything would be perfect.

06:11.120 --> 06:14.582
Yes, they were all
quite happy together.

06:15.750 --> 06:19.212
-But of course, it couldn't last.

06:28.054 --> 06:28.930
Hmm.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.977
-Seven beds?

06:36.479 --> 06:37.980
-Ah!

06:38.064 --> 06:41.192
-We don't go in that room.

06:41.776 --> 06:45.113
Just when Hansel
had grown to like this place,

06:45.196 --> 06:49.075
all his bad feelings came creeping back.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.413
-How come that room has seven beds?

06:53.496 --> 06:54.622
-Ah!
-Ah!

06:56.165 --> 06:59.210
No reason.
Seven's my lucky number.

06:59.293 --> 07:02.672
It's a guest room.
What beds? I was never here.

07:06.592 --> 07:09.262
What? Sometimes people
back out of rooms laughing.

07:09.345 --> 07:12.223
-But she--
-Don't mess this up, Hansel, please.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.935
Gretel refused to admit
that anything was wrong.

07:16.018 --> 07:19.147
But she couldn't ignore
the Bauers' strange behavior.

07:29.657 --> 07:30.992
-Huh?

07:33.953 --> 07:37.165
-Hansel! No!

07:37.248 --> 07:40.126
I have to protect you.
What if it's a bridge troll?

07:40.209 --> 07:42.962
That's the first thing you think of?
Bridge troll?

07:43.045 --> 07:45.465
-Where is there even a bridge?

08:07.862 --> 08:09.238
Quick! Hide!

08:19.957 --> 08:20.875
Phew.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.840
Let's find out
what else is under that trapdoor.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.399
What's this?

08:47.151 --> 08:49.987
It's okay, I landed on my face.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.575
That's their terrible secret.
They've been hiding toys!

08:54.659 --> 08:59.330
Hansel. They obviously
had children before us, seven boys.

08:59.413 --> 09:00.998
-But what happened to them?

09:01.082 --> 09:03.918
Do you think they chopped
their heads off? Or ate them?

09:04.001 --> 09:06.712
Or maybe they just died
from too many turnips.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.714
-Shh.

09:08.798 --> 09:12.635
I think you should…

09:12.718 --> 09:14.679
I can't keep this up any longer.

09:14.762 --> 09:15.888
We mustn't tell 'em.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.431
-They'd be gutted.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.225
-They can't ever know…
-But she--

09:19.308 --> 09:23.521
…we wanted a daughter so much
we never saw what we had.

09:23.604 --> 09:27.984
If Gretel hadn't shown up here,
we would still have our seven boys.

09:28.067 --> 09:28.901
It's true.

09:29.485 --> 09:32.405
And our boys
wouldn't have turned into swallows.

09:33.447 --> 09:35.866
Gretel? Gretel?

09:35.950 --> 09:36.951
Gretel!

09:39.203 --> 09:41.372
Hey, it's okay.

09:41.455 --> 09:43.583
No, it isn't.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.961
But I'm going to make it okay.

09:48.170 --> 09:50.506
I can fix this. I can fix this.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.050
Maybe we could just
find another family somewhere else?

09:53.134 --> 09:56.095
No. I'll find those swallow boys
and bring them back.

09:56.178 --> 10:00.391
Then everything will be fine,
and we can be one big happy family.

10:00.474 --> 10:01.934
Tell the Bauers I'll be back.

10:02.018 --> 10:02.935
Wait.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.438
-You think you're going alone?

10:28.336 --> 10:32.131
Ugh! Okay, when are you gonna tell us
who this weirdo is?

10:32.214 --> 10:34.425
-Not just yet.
-Right.

10:34.508 --> 10:38.971
Because parents are so thrilled about
a creepy man following two kids around.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.435
We're busy.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.170
-Ha! Ha!

11:11.253 --> 11:14.590
Hey, birds, it's me,
your adopted brother. Come back!

11:14.674 --> 11:16.592
Those weren't even swallows.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.053
You gotta stop doing that
every time you see birds.

11:19.136 --> 11:20.012
Look, birds!

11:20.096 --> 11:22.223
-It's me, your adopted brother!

11:22.306 --> 11:25.101
Someone must have seen them.

11:25.184 --> 11:28.270
If only there were someone
who could see the whole kingdom.

11:30.481 --> 11:31.899
Like the sun?

11:46.872 --> 11:49.083
-Worth a try.

11:49.750 --> 11:53.379
And so, Hansel and Gretel climbed
the tallest tree they could find,

11:53.462 --> 11:55.798
-so they could talk to the sun.
-Ah!

12:04.306 --> 12:09.562
And they discovered that the sun is
exactly how you'd expect her to be: hot.

12:09.645 --> 12:11.814
Hello, children!

12:13.399 --> 12:17.361
Oh, I am so glad to have visitors.
It is so lonely up here.

12:17.445 --> 12:18.863
Oh! The moon won't talk to me.

12:18.946 --> 12:21.407
-I borrowed his dictionary and lost it--
-Stop talking.

12:21.490 --> 12:24.869
-You're killing us.
-Ooh, okay, I didn't lose it. I burned it.

12:24.952 --> 12:27.997
-We're leaving now!
-Oh, wait. Please, no, don't go. Please!

12:28.080 --> 12:30.207
-I'm so lonely!
-Go, go, go!

12:35.880 --> 12:38.048
I don't know. Try the moon?

12:38.632 --> 12:39.550
Yeah.

12:43.971 --> 12:45.723
-So… um…

12:46.599 --> 12:47.475
…hi, moon.

12:51.061 --> 12:53.856
Hey, guys. Nice night, isn't it?

12:53.939 --> 12:55.399
-So…

12:55.483 --> 12:58.027
-Have you ever been eaten?

12:59.570 --> 13:02.656
Oh, no, wait, guys. That came out wrong.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.998
-What? No!
-Don't tense up! Go limp!

13:14.502 --> 13:15.961
Ooh, not that limp.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.433
I'm so sorry.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.734
Gretel, are you feeling okay?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.486
I'm fine.

13:40.569 --> 13:42.363
That's not what your face says.

13:42.446 --> 13:44.198
Look at these pictures.

13:44.281 --> 13:46.325
The Bauers were happier before us.

13:46.909 --> 13:49.203
They were right. This is my fault.

13:49.286 --> 13:52.498
-How could it be your fault?
-I don't know, everything's my fault!

13:52.581 --> 13:55.918
Look at all the stuff that's happened
since I made us leave home.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.753
Maybe I'm cursed or something.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.880
I would've seen if you got cursed.

13:59.964 --> 14:03.008
There would've been a witch
or the Devil doing spooky hand stuff.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.970
Whoo! Whoo!

14:06.554 --> 14:09.139
It's me! I'm the problem!

14:09.223 --> 14:11.100
-Gretel!

14:21.193 --> 14:23.487
I ruined everything.

14:32.079 --> 14:34.373
What tears have awakened us?

14:35.749 --> 14:37.001
It's us.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.253
The stars.

14:40.045 --> 14:44.800
What? Didn't you know that the stars talk
to you when you cry on their reflections?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.427
Boy, public education

14:46.510 --> 14:48.721
-has really gone downhill.

14:48.804 --> 14:50.556
I think this snake is dead.

14:51.807 --> 14:52.641
Um…

14:53.225 --> 14:56.353
Hello, stars. I'm Gretel.

14:56.437 --> 14:57.771
-What's going on?
-Shh.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.274
I really need some help.

15:00.774 --> 15:04.987
We can help you. We see everything.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.197
Uh, but not my alone bathroom time, right?

15:07.281 --> 15:10.159
We know you seek the seven swallows.

15:10.242 --> 15:14.038
They came to us,
and asked us to help them hide somewhere.

15:14.121 --> 15:16.582
Far away from their cares.

15:16.665 --> 15:20.169
Their cares? Did they mean… me?

15:20.252 --> 15:22.379
-It is possible.

15:22.463 --> 15:27.301
They said a girl came,
and they were turned into swallows.

15:27.384 --> 15:29.094
So it was my fault.

15:29.845 --> 15:33.265
I have to fix this.
Tell me where they are. Please!

15:33.349 --> 15:38.145
We sent them to our secret citadel
high atop the Crystal Mountain.

15:38.228 --> 15:41.190
It has a hidden door, and to find it

15:41.273 --> 15:43.901
one must solve this riddle:

15:43.984 --> 15:47.029
though I am dark, I die by night.

15:47.613 --> 15:51.033
I come again with morning light.

15:51.867 --> 15:54.036
A giraffe. No, a-- a scorpion.

15:54.119 --> 15:56.830
No, no, don't tell me, uh, two giraffes.

15:56.914 --> 16:00.668
Oh my.
You are very bad at riddles.

16:00.751 --> 16:01.627
Three giraffes.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.796
Once you have solved the riddle,

16:03.879 --> 16:08.801
you will need this rare
and magical key to open the door.

16:08.884 --> 16:12.179
-Uh… It looks like a chicken bone.

16:12.262 --> 16:14.431
It is a chicken bone.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.350
That doesn't make any sense.

16:16.433 --> 16:17.434
We know.

16:18.018 --> 16:20.187
Magic is weird.

16:21.438 --> 16:24.483
Why would the swallows
want someone to help them hide from you?

16:24.566 --> 16:26.735
Because I wrecked their lives.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.070
But I'm gonna fix it.

16:28.153 --> 16:31.156
I'm gonna walk all the way
to Crystal Mountain, answer a riddle,

16:31.240 --> 16:33.283
and open a door with a chicken bone.

16:34.743 --> 16:37.871
-I can't let you go alone. Let's do this!

16:39.540 --> 16:41.834
-Oh, that way's bad.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.586
-That way's bad too!

16:45.087 --> 16:47.464
That way's okay,
but the rabbit looked at me funny!

16:47.548 --> 16:50.718
It's this way, Hansel.

16:54.138 --> 16:58.350
Hansel and Gretel set out on a daring
quest to find the seven swallows,

16:58.434 --> 17:01.353
journeying bravely
across treacherous landscapes.

17:01.937 --> 17:04.148
They ventured through blazing deserts.

17:04.231 --> 17:06.233
They ventured through muck-filled swamps!

17:06.316 --> 17:08.777
They ventured
through Lollipop Meadow!

17:08.861 --> 17:10.863
-No!

17:10.946 --> 17:14.992
The longer they journeyed,
the more Gretel's guilt consumed her.

17:15.075 --> 17:18.454
-I will fix this.

17:18.537 --> 17:21.832
Turnip mother will be happy.
Turnip father will learn to smile.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.209
We will be perfect.

17:25.210 --> 17:28.338
Gretel, are you feeling okay?

17:28.422 --> 17:30.591
Am I feeling? 

17:30.674 --> 17:33.260
Hansel, it's time you learned something.

17:33.343 --> 17:36.847
Feelings are stupid.
All they do is cause pain.

17:36.930 --> 17:40.267
I'm done with them!
I don't have any feelings!

17:40.350 --> 17:42.561
That's a weird thing to yell angrily.

17:43.312 --> 17:44.229
Wait up!

17:49.151 --> 17:52.362
As time passed,
Hansel's courage grew.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.919
Don't even start with me, rabbit.

18:08.378 --> 18:11.632
And Gretel's guilt
turned her cold.

18:11.715 --> 18:15.636
Gretel, did you see that?
I am the king of the forest.

18:15.719 --> 18:19.431
Yeah, don't pick at it and it'll be okay.
Let's keep moving.

18:39.618 --> 18:42.496
Finally,
after many months of travel,

18:42.579 --> 18:45.415
they arrived at the foot
of Crystal Mountain…

18:48.460 --> 18:52.131
…taller and stronger than ever before.

18:52.214 --> 18:55.217
Let's go get us some swallows
and make our turnip parents happy.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.510
Exactly.

19:36.842 --> 19:40.387
Now I know what you're thinking. "Yay,
they made it, I feel all warm inside."

19:40.470 --> 19:41.930
Well, don't.

19:42.014 --> 19:47.144
And, parents, you need to know
this is about to get inappropriate.

19:47.227 --> 19:49.188
You might want to blindfold your kids.

19:49.271 --> 19:54.026
Or peck out their eyes.
Just go peck, peck, peck! It's so easy!

19:54.610 --> 19:55.611
Wow!

19:55.694 --> 19:58.488
This is the most beautiful place
I've ever seen.

19:58.572 --> 20:00.115
There's no door.

20:00.824 --> 20:01.909
The riddle!

20:01.992 --> 20:04.828
Right. You must have been
working on it this whole time.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.622
You'd think so, right?

20:06.705 --> 20:09.708
-Um, how did that riddle go again?

20:09.791 --> 20:12.377
It's a good thing
I wrote it down.

20:13.629 --> 20:18.508
"Though I am dark, I die by night.
I come again with morning light."

20:18.592 --> 20:19.676
Four giraffes.

20:21.345 --> 20:24.765
The sun comes in the morning,
but it isn't dark.

20:24.848 --> 20:28.518
Night is dark,
but it goes away in the morning.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.520
-Huh?

20:31.396 --> 20:33.732
Hey, that rock
looks like a giraffe.

20:33.815 --> 20:37.236
-Told you it'd be a giraffe.

20:38.987 --> 20:40.447
-A shadow.

20:40.530 --> 20:42.157
It's a shadow!

20:59.883 --> 21:01.385
-Yes!

21:01.885 --> 21:03.512
Time for the chicken bone.

21:04.554 --> 21:07.849
-The chicken bone!

21:07.933 --> 21:09.685
Oh, no, no, no, no!

21:09.768 --> 21:11.979
A hole? No!

21:12.521 --> 21:14.940
-Here, uh, let me look.

21:16.316 --> 21:17.359
Oh…

21:17.442 --> 21:18.902
It's not here.

21:20.821 --> 21:23.365
The bone is gone. I'm sorry.

21:26.868 --> 21:29.079
No, I'm sorry.

21:29.162 --> 21:31.498
I hurt you and I hurt everyone.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.420
Open!

21:37.004 --> 21:40.590
-Open… these doors!
-Gretel, stop it!

21:40.674 --> 21:42.634
-Please!

21:47.723 --> 21:49.099
What are you doing?

21:49.182 --> 21:52.019
-Whatever it takes.
-Stop!

21:52.102 --> 21:54.813
Stop right there!
You can't show this next part.

21:54.896 --> 21:56.857
-I mean, it's too horrible.
-Show it!

21:56.940 --> 21:59.943
It's not your job to stop the story.
We're telling the story--

22:00.027 --> 22:03.030
-Someone's gotta protect these children.
-Mama wants some gore!

22:03.113 --> 22:06.241
We're not going to see details, Jacob.
I'm not an idiot.

22:06.325 --> 22:09.995
You see, gentle viewer,
while Gretel didn't have a chicken bone,

22:10.078 --> 22:13.915
she had another bone
of around the same size.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.501
A bone of her very own.

22:17.961 --> 22:21.965
-Yes, Gretel used her own finger as a key.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.550
Pfft!

22:27.220 --> 22:30.432
I know what you're thinking,
and you're right, cutting off your finger

22:30.515 --> 22:32.809
is a terribly foolish thing to do,

22:32.893 --> 22:36.563
but we have to tell the story
just as it happened.

22:36.646 --> 22:38.065
This is crazy.

22:38.148 --> 22:40.734
I still don't get
why her finger would open the door.

22:40.817 --> 22:43.403
And why would she have to chop it off
for it to work?

22:43.487 --> 22:45.238
It doesn't make any sense.

22:45.322 --> 22:49.076
I don't know. Maybe the important part
was the sacrifice.

23:22.859 --> 23:23.902
I…

23:25.862 --> 23:28.365
…bring news from your parents.

23:28.990 --> 23:30.992
They'd like you to come back home.

23:32.953 --> 23:35.956
Please. You have to come home with us.

23:36.039 --> 23:38.333
I'm the girl who showed up
and caused all of this.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.043
-Please!

23:42.379 --> 23:43.422
Let me try.

23:44.881 --> 23:46.383
Hello, my bird brothers.

23:46.466 --> 23:49.428
-I have something for you.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.096
This was yours, wasn't it?

23:52.556 --> 23:55.267
We found your father crying over this toy.

23:55.350 --> 23:57.060
He really misses you all.

23:57.144 --> 23:58.812
More than you can imagine.

23:58.895 --> 24:00.480
-Oh!

24:18.540 --> 24:19.958
He misses us?

24:20.542 --> 24:23.003
Deeply. They both do.

24:23.086 --> 24:25.422
I'm so sorry for what I did to you.

24:25.505 --> 24:26.590
What?

24:26.673 --> 24:29.384
-No. You didn't do anything.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.803
But… What are you saying?

24:32.387 --> 24:34.264
Right after you came to our house,

24:34.347 --> 24:37.350
our father told us
to go to the well to get some water.

24:37.434 --> 24:39.936
Your new sister will want a bath,

24:40.020 --> 24:42.397
so fill that tub to the top.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.858
-And no horsing around!

24:45.442 --> 24:48.236
But, well, we didn't listen.

24:49.946 --> 24:51.656
-Oh boy.

24:54.326 --> 24:57.496
-You're useless. Useless!

24:57.579 --> 25:02.417
I wish you'd all just
turn into swallows and fly away!

25:02.501 --> 25:05.587
Fly away!

25:11.468 --> 25:13.762
You see, this happened when you showed up.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.680
-But it wasn't your fault.
-Huh.

25:16.389 --> 25:19.392
-It wasn't my fault?

25:20.101 --> 25:21.895
It wasn't my fault.

25:21.978 --> 25:23.146
All that time,

25:23.230 --> 25:25.857
all those months of travel.

25:25.941 --> 25:28.109
Everything I put Hansel through…

25:28.193 --> 25:31.613
-I kinda had fun, though.
-I cut my finger off!

25:31.696 --> 25:33.323
I said I had fun.

25:33.406 --> 25:38.328
All this just because
Mr. Bauer lost his temper?

25:38.411 --> 25:41.790
Pretty weird, right?
So, are you coming back home with us?

25:41.873 --> 25:43.250
No! Never!

25:43.333 --> 25:46.586
There are no perfect parents!
There's just pain.

25:46.670 --> 25:49.965
Pain and suffering and blood!

25:50.048 --> 25:52.092
Okay.

25:52.175 --> 25:55.136
Well, um, we're just gonna take off, then.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.806
We can find our own way home.
Nice meeting you.

25:57.889 --> 25:59.516
Good luck with your suffering.

26:00.016 --> 26:00.934
And blood.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.273
We never said it when we were in there,

26:06.356 --> 26:09.484
-but we all missed our mom and dad.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.069
I want you to have this.

26:12.904 --> 26:13.863
Thank you.

26:16.199 --> 26:17.284
Bye!

26:18.743 --> 26:21.079
-What do we do now, Hansel?

26:21.162 --> 26:24.457
Everything I think is wrong. I failed you.

26:25.041 --> 26:28.378
No, I'm the one who failed you.

26:28.461 --> 26:30.839
I should have protected you
from our parents,

26:30.922 --> 26:34.009
from Mrs. Baker lady, from the Bauers.

26:34.092 --> 26:36.094
And now look what happened to your finger.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.638
Who's gonna take care of us?

26:39.222 --> 26:40.515
No one.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.267
There's no one to love us.

26:43.768 --> 26:45.312
I love you, Gretel.

26:46.855 --> 26:48.398
And I love you, Hansel.

26:49.065 --> 26:50.984
Do we even need parents?

26:51.818 --> 26:52.652
You're right.

26:53.278 --> 26:55.363
I've had it wrong this whole time.

26:55.447 --> 26:56.823
We don't need parents.

26:57.490 --> 26:59.951
-All we need is each other.

27:00.035 --> 27:03.371
Gretel, I won't let anything
hurt you ever again.

27:03.872 --> 27:06.708
Come on, let's find someplace
to make a new home.

27:07.208 --> 27:10.503
-Someplace warm.
-Watch your step.

27:10.587 --> 27:12.213
I heard about this one guy Jack

27:12.297 --> 27:15.091
who fell down a hill like this
and broke his crown.

27:15.175 --> 27:19.220
And so they ventured down
the mountain toward a tiny patch of green,

27:19.304 --> 27:22.140
where they could live happily ever after.

27:22.223 --> 27:23.058
Ha!

27:23.141 --> 27:24.684
Like that's gonna happen.

27:24.768 --> 27:28.271
Hey, if you thought
this chapter was gruesome,

27:28.355 --> 27:30.231
don't stick around for the next one.

27:30.315 --> 27:31.983
It's gonna be… Ugh.

27:32.067 --> 27:33.902
It's just so nasty.

27:33.985 --> 27:36.696
I am psyched for this next chapter.

27:36.780 --> 27:40.450
Are we gonna see guts?
'Cause I feel like we're gonna see guts!
