their memory erased,

09:10.250 --> 09:11.248
or you'll get relocated.

09:11.250 --> 09:14.152
Perry, I'm not part
of your host family.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.920
I know, I know,
it's a technicality.

09:15.922 --> 09:18.356
Look, I don't want Candace
and the boys to lose you,

09:18.358 --> 09:20.792
but I also do not want
my mind erased.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.994
I'm on the last 10 minutes
of that  <i>Grievance</i> movie

09:22.996 --> 09:25.430
and I don't wanna watch
that whole scary mess again.

09:25.432 --> 09:27.465
So, uh, can't we
just keep this a secret?

09:33.472 --> 09:35.907
Luckily, sir, it looks
like the residents
were not home.

09:39.812 --> 09:43.014
(CLEARS THROAT)
Hello? Uh, anybody there?

09:43.016 --> 09:44.449
MONOGRAM:
I'll take care of it.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.084
Oh, hello there,
young teenager.
Do you live here?

09:46.086 --> 09:50.154
Yes. I walked home
from the mall to find this.

09:50.156 --> 09:51.823
What is happening here?

09:51.825 --> 09:53.825
Oh, you didn't see
what happened.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.526
Well, uh,
we're with the city,

09:55.528 --> 09:58.329
and there was
a swamp gas incident
here, uh...

09:58.331 --> 10:00.965
We'll just get it
all cleaned up and
get out of your hair.

10:00.967 --> 10:01.965
(IN LOW VOICE)
Psst! Hey, Carl!

10:01.967 --> 10:04.502
We're not gonna need
the mind-erasing device...

10:04.504 --> 10:08.039
I... I mean, monkey wrench.
(NERVOUS CHUCKLE)
It's a monkey wrench. Yeah.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.307
We don't need that.

10:11.410 --> 10:13.278
Happy birthday,
Isabella!

10:13.280 --> 10:15.113
Thanks, guys!

10:15.115 --> 10:18.116
I still can't figure out
what went wrong
with the grand finale.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.351
After the laser light show
and the fireballs,

10:20.353 --> 10:22.020
the swans should've
been released and...

10:22.022 --> 10:25.823
Phineas, I really liked
the butterflies.
Thank you.

10:25.825 --> 10:27.325
Well, to make it
up to you,

10:27.327 --> 10:30.261
it's kind of lame,
but maybe Ferb and I could,

10:30.263 --> 10:32.964
I don't know,
take you out for some
ice cream or something?

10:32.966 --> 10:34.399
Uh...

10:34.401 --> 10:37.168
I just remembered
there's something
I need to do.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.370
You two go.
Is that cool?

10:39.372 --> 10:40.905
Yes. Very cool.

10:40.907 --> 10:42.373
Ferb.

10:42.375 --> 10:43.941
PHINEAS: So, did you get
what you wished for?

10:43.943 --> 10:45.410
Oh, yeah,
I already asked that.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.211
Confetti
and streamers!

10:47.213 --> 10:49.080
Hold on. Gonna
get another napkin.

10:49.948 --> 10:51.382
And butterflies.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.885
You always
give me butterflies.

11:05.197 --> 11:07.498
CANDACE: Ah,
look at them out there.
What are they up to?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.367
Ah, looks like
Phineas is saying,

11:09.369 --> 11:11.903
(SLOWLY)
"Where's Perry?"

11:11.905 --> 11:14.205
Huh. Where do you
think Perry goes
every day, Stace?

11:14.207 --> 11:15.373
(DEFENSIVELY)
How do I know?
Why are you asking me?

11:15.375 --> 11:17.542
How should I know?
Uh, don't look at me!

11:19.345 --> 11:21.312
(GRUNTS) I don't know
why I was asking you.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.981
<i>Whew! No one suspects a thing.</i>
