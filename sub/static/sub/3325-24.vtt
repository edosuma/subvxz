WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.412
Previously on "Teen Wolf..."

00:02.628 --> 00:04.914
You essentially opened
a door in your minds.

00:05.089 --> 00:07.045
Let me in!

00:07.258 --> 00:08.623
He is nogitsune now.

00:08.843 --> 00:09.923
He is void.

00:10.094 --> 00:13.086
Scott is going to try and guide him back
from the depths of own his subconscious.

00:19.228 --> 00:20.604
How can there be two of him?

00:20.771 --> 00:23.387
There isn't.
There's a demon wearing his face.

00:23.608 --> 00:25.473
There's been a change in ownership.

00:25.651 --> 00:26.811
Now they belong to me.

00:32.825 --> 00:34.156
Allison.

01:04.815 --> 01:08.433
Scott, look at me.
Look at me.

01:09.529 --> 01:11.690
Scott, look at me.

01:11.906 --> 01:13.112
You have to remember.

01:14.408 --> 01:15.989
You called me first, okay?

01:16.202 --> 01:18.238
Say it.
You called me first.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.996
- I called you...
- Not "you."

01:23.209 --> 01:25.325
Say "Mr. Argent" or "her dad."

01:25.503 --> 01:27.084
- I called her dad first.
- What else?

01:27.296 --> 01:28.797
What happened?

01:29.799 --> 01:31.380
There were two of them.

01:32.885 --> 01:34.625
They tried to steal our car.

01:34.804 --> 01:37.420
They wore masks.
One of them had a knife.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.256
You think.
Don't get specific, Scott.

01:40.476 --> 01:42.933
You saw something sharp and metallic.

01:43.145 --> 01:44.601
You think it was a knife.

01:44.772 --> 01:45.887
What do you say next?

01:46.107 --> 01:48.564
If you get confused,
what do you always repeat?

01:49.944 --> 01:51.935
- It happened so fast.
- That's right.

01:52.154 --> 01:53.985
Say it again. Scott!

01:55.324 --> 01:56.905
Say it again.

01:58.911 --> 02:00.196
How are you doing this?

02:06.502 --> 02:07.958
It's what we do.

02:12.258 --> 02:14.169
It's what we do.

02:19.307 --> 02:21.047
Can you remember anything else?

02:24.478 --> 02:25.763
Anything else?

02:28.232 --> 02:29.392
Baac?

02:30.943 --> 02:32.444
I'm sorry.

02:36.198 --> 02:38.359
ltjust happened so fast.

02:49.128 --> 02:50.914
Here, it'll calm you.

02:51.130 --> 02:52.290
What is it?

02:52.673 --> 02:53.628
Tea.

02:54.133 --> 02:55.794
What? Like magic tea?

02:56.510 --> 02:58.671
No, chamomile tea. Drink it.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.675
He's not safe here.

03:03.434 --> 03:04.640
He's not safe anywhere.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.717
But Allison killed one of them.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.144
Doesn't that mean something?
She killed an oni.

03:09.357 --> 03:10.642
Is that even possible?

03:10.816 --> 03:12.727
- I'm not sure how.
- But she did it.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.980
- She killed one of them.
- Yeah, and then they killed her.

03:18.491 --> 03:19.856
Allison's dead.

03:22.662 --> 03:25.745
Now I guess the only good thing is
it looks like I'm dying, too.

03:30.795 --> 03:33.457
He made a powerful move
by splitting the two of you.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.835
So what's our move?

03:38.052 --> 03:40.919
At this point, you need a divine move.

03:41.222 --> 03:42.257
What's that?

03:43.057 --> 03:46.299
In the game of "Go,"
it's what we call a truly inspired,

03:46.519 --> 03:48.134
or out-of-the-box move.

03:48.521 --> 03:51.888
The nogitsune has had "sente,"
the advantage, until this point.

03:52.149 --> 03:53.650
What you need is a divine move

03:53.859 --> 03:55.815
in order to turn the game around.

03:56.070 --> 03:58.561
Okay, so is anyone
feeling divinely inspired?

03:58.739 --> 04:01.276
Mom, you said you trapped it
in a glass jar, right?

04:01.492 --> 04:03.403
It wasn't the jar that trapped it.

04:03.619 --> 04:05.155
It was where l buried it.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.323
The Nemeton.

04:07.623 --> 04:09.159
A place I don't know too much about.

04:09.375 --> 04:10.410
Who does?

04:10.835 --> 04:12.166
Deaton.

04:12.837 --> 04:14.122
Deaton does.

04:36.026 --> 04:38.642
I appreciate the concern,
but you don't have to stay.

04:41.157 --> 04:42.317
I'll be all right.

04:45.536 --> 04:47.618
I've dealt with this before.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.998
l have a capacity

04:54.170 --> 04:57.082
and an ability
to compartmentalize my emotions.

05:00.342 --> 05:01.331
I don't.

05:22.990 --> 05:23.979
Hey.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.191
We need to try and keep this
quiet for as long as we can.

05:26.410 --> 05:29.072
Once the press finds out about this,
they're gonna be all over those kids.

05:29.288 --> 05:31.028
You want a squad car outside your house?

05:31.874 --> 05:34.081
Yeah, might be a good idea tonight.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.016
Should be fine in a couple of hours.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.811
Unless whoever shot you
manages to find you again.

06:39.483 --> 06:41.394
Lydia's with Scott. We need to go.

06:41.610 --> 06:43.225
Are you gonna try
to convince her to go with you?

06:45.114 --> 06:47.696
I'm gonna try
and convince her to run and hide.

06:47.867 --> 06:50.199
- Like any sane person would do.
- And Danny?

06:50.411 --> 06:51.651
Allison's dead.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.324
Stiles is dying. What do you think?

06:54.540 --> 06:56.531
I think Danny won't believe you.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.082
And Lydia would never run and hide.

06:59.295 --> 07:00.284
Because of Stiles?

07:00.504 --> 07:01.789
Because of Scott.

07:03.382 --> 07:05.543
You've been trying
to find a way into his pack.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.886
Trying to earn his trust,
trying to fight for him.

07:08.053 --> 07:09.463
You've had it wrong the whole time.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.216
You don't fight for a leader.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.093
You fight for a leader's cause.

07:13.309 --> 07:14.469
What cause?

07:16.186 --> 07:18.438
Scott's always been about one thing.

07:18.981 --> 07:20.221
Saving his friends.

07:20.524 --> 07:24.437
He will do anything and everything
to save the people he cares about.

07:24.695 --> 07:27.437
When there's no chance of winning,
he keeps fighting.

07:27.990 --> 07:30.276
When all hope is lost, he finds another way.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.824
And when he's beaten down,
he stands up again.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.235
You want to earn a place in his pack?

07:35.456 --> 07:36.616
You want redemption?

07:36.790 --> 07:40.157
Find another way to stand and fight.

07:44.340 --> 07:47.127
Stiles and Kira said
it was the Nemeton that kept it trapped.

07:47.343 --> 07:50.210
The problem is
this isn't even a person you're fighting.

07:50.429 --> 07:52.465
It just looks like one.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.933
It's a spirit that's taken
the shape of a human.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.474
- The shape of my best friend.
- Someone caught it once.

07:57.686 --> 07:59.267
Someone can do it again, right?

07:59.855 --> 08:00.810
I don't know.

08:00.981 --> 08:04.473
This thing was trapped a long time ago,
before the Nemeton was cut down.

08:04.693 --> 08:07.901
- It doesn't have the same power anymore.
- Is there anything that does?

08:08.322 --> 08:09.402
Possibly.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.022
When the tree was whole,

08:11.200 --> 08:14.283
its wood was sometimes
used to contain powerful objects.

08:14.495 --> 08:16.406
But those objects are very rare.

08:16.622 --> 08:18.738
Wait a second. Powerful objects?

08:20.292 --> 08:22.749
- Like an Alpha's claws?
- Which Alpha?

08:23.712 --> 08:24.747
Talia Hale.

08:26.173 --> 08:29.336
Peter had them in this wooden box
with a triskele carved on the lid.

08:29.551 --> 08:31.928
What if it was made from the Nemeton?

08:32.721 --> 08:33.756
It was.

08:34.974 --> 08:36.009
How do you know?

08:37.393 --> 08:38.929
Because I made it.

08:48.070 --> 08:49.105
Hi, there.

08:51.657 --> 08:54.444
Could you page
Melissa McCall for me, please?

09:10.926 --> 09:13.133
Well, I guess I'll just find her myself.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.069
Sheriff!

11:17.010 --> 11:19.626
ljust think
it would be better if it came from you.

11:19.847 --> 11:23.089
So I tell Scott
that his dad went back to San Francisco,

11:23.308 --> 11:26.050
says he's sorry,
but he didn't have time to say goodbye?

11:26.520 --> 11:29.307
Right. Then I'll send
a follow-up email or something.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.437
You're an idiot.

11:32.067 --> 11:33.728
What's wrong with that?

11:33.944 --> 11:34.979
Seﬁouﬂy?

11:39.700 --> 11:42.533
Raf, you say that you want
a relationship with your son.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.780
You can't just bail after one fight.

11:45.122 --> 11:46.987
- He hates me.
- He doesn't hate you.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.664
He just wants you to try harder.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.578
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

11:58.802 --> 12:00.087
Get back!

12:14.443 --> 12:15.432
Careful.

12:16.153 --> 12:18.189
That one takes some practice.

12:20.991 --> 12:22.276
When Allison was learning,

12:25.245 --> 12:27.236
She wouldn't give up on it, though.

12:29.833 --> 12:31.789
She kept trying to say something.

12:32.294 --> 12:33.454
What's that?

12:33.670 --> 12:35.831
She was trying to say something to Scott.

12:36.048 --> 12:38.460
"You have to tell him,"
she said.

12:39.593 --> 12:41.424
"You have to tell my father..."

12:41.595 --> 12:43.426
She didn't get a chance to finish it,
but I'm sure it was just

12:43.639 --> 12:45.254
that she loved you.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.057
It's okay.

12:49.686 --> 12:52.769
It's okay, she,
she made a point of telling me earlier.

12:53.899 --> 12:56.641
- Earlier?
- There's a tradition we have.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.687
The silver bullet.

13:00.239 --> 13:02.446
She was making a silver arrowhead.

13:07.663 --> 13:08.994
Where is it?

13:10.791 --> 13:12.281
The arrowhead?

13:14.503 --> 13:15.618
Downstairs.

13:19.091 --> 13:20.297
I need to see it.

13:22.386 --> 13:23.341
Why?

13:25.889 --> 13:27.925
Because I have a feeling it isn't there.

13:32.271 --> 13:33.431
What the hell is that?

13:33.647 --> 13:36.104
I think it's poisonous. It hurts like hell.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.066
Oh, be careful.

13:46.076 --> 13:48.283
- I'm gonna get you out of here.
- Okay.

13:57.462 --> 13:59.043
You're gonna need a bigger gun.

14:11.768 --> 14:12.723
No!

14:24.781 --> 14:26.646
Derek's got the triskele box.
He's gonna meet us.

14:31.288 --> 14:32.243
What's wrong?

14:32.456 --> 14:34.071
Something's happening.

14:34.291 --> 14:36.407
I had this sudden rushing feeling,

14:37.169 --> 14:38.579
like we're running out of time.

14:38.795 --> 14:39.955
Yeah.

14:43.342 --> 14:45.333
Yeah, I kind of got that feeling, too.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.804
Why would she make four of these?

14:59.024 --> 15:00.139
She made five.

15:00.359 --> 15:02.816
She made the first one,
then she figured it out.

15:04.571 --> 15:05.777
What am I missing?

15:05.989 --> 15:08.822
She used the first silver arrowhead
to kill one of the oni.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.194
We saw her do it.

15:15.499 --> 15:16.534
How?

15:16.750 --> 15:18.741
The same way that you almost did.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.120
Do you remember when you told us

15:20.295 --> 15:22.160
about one of your first gun deals,
the yakuza?

15:26.343 --> 15:28.129
That meeting wasn't one of my first deals.

15:28.345 --> 15:29.425
It was my first.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.516
The bullet that you used
to shoot the oni.

15:40.732 --> 15:41.972
Was that a silver bullet?

15:42.275 --> 15:43.264
Yes.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.481
But it didn't kill him.

15:47.697 --> 15:50.313
- ltjust broke his mask.
- Probably went straight through.

15:50.492 --> 15:53.108
What if silver is like a poison to them?

15:55.038 --> 15:56.414
What if it needs to stay in the body?

16:00.335 --> 16:03.168
What if that's
what she was trying to tell Scott?

16:03.380 --> 16:06.042
What if that's what she was trying to tell
you, that she'd figured it out?

16:06.425 --> 16:07.881
These four were still setting

16:08.093 --> 16:09.708
when she went off to meet Scott.

16:10.387 --> 16:11.843
We could stop them.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.088
No.

16:15.267 --> 16:16.803
We can kill them.

16:30.157 --> 16:31.863
What the hell happened?

16:32.075 --> 16:33.190
They left.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.994
They just... They left.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.491
Why did they let us live?

16:46.715 --> 16:48.580
I'm not so sure they did.

17:02.898 --> 17:04.058
Scott, hold on.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.310
I know what you're all thinking.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.266
If this works, it might kill me, too.

17:09.446 --> 17:12.438
But even if it does,
you have to go through with it.

17:13.617 --> 17:15.573
Stick with the plan, okay?

17:16.203 --> 17:17.613
The plan is to save you.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.328
That's the plan I'm going with.

17:51.780 --> 17:54.317
Oh, this is definitely not part of the plan.

17:55.450 --> 17:57.031
It's me again.
I'm getting nothing from Dispatch.

17:57.202 --> 17:59.363
No one's on the line.
Call me back, Stilinski.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.198
Call me as soon as you get this.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.958
Call Scott. You need to call Scott.

18:07.170 --> 18:09.206
- You're gonna be all right.
- That's not what I mean.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.129
Melissa, I need to get you out of here.
I'm gonna help you to your feet, okay?

18:12.342 --> 18:14.424
- Raf, listen to me.
- You're gonna be fine.

18:14.636 --> 18:17.093
If something happens,
you need to work it out with Scott.

18:17.305 --> 18:19.967
- Melissa...
- You just need to try again.

18:20.183 --> 18:21.764
I tried to apologize.

18:22.102 --> 18:25.060
He's a teenage boy.
He doesn't care about apologies.

18:25.272 --> 18:26.933
He wants you to do better.

18:27.190 --> 18:29.055
And he probably wants you
to suffer a little.

18:29.568 --> 18:32.560
Promise me you'll make it work.

18:34.864 --> 18:36.274
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.421
Did you bring us a present?

19:04.603 --> 19:06.218
I brought two.

19:08.273 --> 19:12.232
I've heard of an Alpha pack, Derek,
but not a pack of former Alphas.

19:13.361 --> 19:14.897
It's a little sad, isn't it?

19:15.238 --> 19:17.570
I might not be an Alpha anymore,

19:19.409 --> 19:21.240
but I can still light like one.

19:50.774 --> 19:54.062
Like I promised, Stiles.

19:55.236 --> 19:59.320
We're going to kill all of them.

20:00.617 --> 20:05.236
One by one.

20:19.511 --> 20:21.297
What the hell is this? Where are we?

20:22.389 --> 20:25.927
Between life and death.

20:26.685 --> 20:27.845
Bardo.

20:28.061 --> 20:32.430
But there are no
peaceful deities here, Lydia.

20:34.484 --> 20:37.100
You're dying, Stiles.

20:37.779 --> 20:42.899
And now everyone
you care about is dying, too.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.572
What? What do you mean?

20:46.830 --> 20:51.449
I've captured almost all
of the territories on the board, Stiles.

20:53.253 --> 20:54.709
The hospital.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.836
The sheriff's station.

20:58.425 --> 21:03.465
And now the animal clinic.

21:31.291 --> 21:35.284
Do you know the ritual of seppuku, Stiles?

21:36.296 --> 21:38.002
No, and I don't want to.

21:38.214 --> 21:42.253
When a samurai disembowels himself

21:42.886 --> 21:47.129
with his own sword to maintain his honor,

21:47.974 --> 21:50.431
but that's not the cut that kills him.

21:50.643 --> 21:55.933
The killing stroke
is made by his "kaishakunin,"

21:56.608 --> 21:59.145
who beheads the samurai

22:00.111 --> 22:02.022
with his own "katana."

22:04.949 --> 22:06.450
Scott...

22:06.659 --> 22:09.947
Scott is your "kaishakunin."

22:11.247 --> 22:16.458
I'm going to make
your best friend kill you, Stiles.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.918
And you're going to let him.

22:20.006 --> 22:22.088
Because just like you,

22:22.383 --> 22:24.795
they're all going to die.

22:25.136 --> 22:28.879
Everyone touched by an oni's blade.

22:29.849 --> 22:34.388
Unless Scott kills you first.

22:37.023 --> 22:40.140
Why? Why are you doing this?

22:42.487 --> 22:44.944
To win the game.

22:53.623 --> 22:55.989
Parrish, keep your eyes open.

22:57.544 --> 22:58.954
Deputy!

23:00.630 --> 23:03.292
What is this? This is poison?

23:04.509 --> 23:07.376
Whatever it is, ah, it's working fast.

23:13.351 --> 23:15.091
Don't leave him again.

23:16.271 --> 23:17.556
Promise me?

23:18.565 --> 23:20.101
You told me to leave.

23:20.316 --> 23:22.648
I told a drunk to get out of the house.

23:23.486 --> 23:27.104
I didn't tell his father
to get out of his life.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.650
You came back to make it up to him, right?

23:31.870 --> 23:34.327
I came back to make it up to both of you.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.760
How is this happening?
How are we in this place?

23:51.931 --> 23:53.922
You're asking me? A month ago,
I'd never even touched a sword.

24:07.822 --> 24:09.028
Where the hell are they?

24:10.700 --> 24:12.361
The jeep's here.
They have to be somewhere.

24:12.869 --> 24:13.904
In the school!

24:27.508 --> 24:28.884
This can't be real.

24:29.344 --> 24:30.584
Yeah, tell that to them.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.802
You have to get on the box.
Someone get on the box!

24:45.276 --> 24:46.732
I hate ninjas.

25:11.094 --> 25:12.129
Hey.

25:14.305 --> 25:17.138
Hey. Hey, there's blood at her lips.
What does that mean?

25:18.059 --> 25:20.015
There's blood. What does it mean?

25:39.455 --> 25:40.615
Stiles, no!

25:43.710 --> 25:44.825
Stiles.

25:45.294 --> 25:47.000
What if it saves you?
What if it saves all of you?

25:47.171 --> 25:50.629
- What if it's just another trick?
- No more tricks, Lydia.

25:51.509 --> 25:53.010
End if, Scott.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.835
Let your friend fall on his own sword.

25:56.055 --> 25:59.468
Do for him what he cannot do for himself.

26:00.435 --> 26:02.426
Do it, Scott.

26:02.645 --> 26:04.806
Be his "kaishakunin."

26:05.606 --> 26:07.642
Give up the game.

26:27.795 --> 26:30.707
You have no moves left.

26:37.597 --> 26:38.586
I do.

26:44.062 --> 26:45.598
A divine move.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.398
We can't do this, we can't beat them.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.026
Take the box. We'll hold them off!

27:19.138 --> 27:20.127
What was that?

27:20.765 --> 27:21.845
Silver.

27:23.684 --> 27:26.471
Isaac, the box.
Get the triskele box to Scott!

27:28.981 --> 27:31.358
Stop fighting them. It's an illusion.

27:31.567 --> 27:33.103
You have to stop fighting them.

27:33.319 --> 27:34.934
It looks real and it feels real,

27:35.113 --> 27:37.729
but Scott, you gotta trust me,
it's an illusion.

28:38.593 --> 28:39.924
We're okay.

28:41.095 --> 28:42.130
We're...

28:48.644 --> 28:50.430
This was my game.

28:51.981 --> 28:54.313
You think you can beat me at my game?

29:05.453 --> 29:07.239
Get the arrow. It's the last one.

29:23.512 --> 29:24.718
Aiden!

29:30.478 --> 29:31.968
Divine move.

29:32.188 --> 29:34.804
Divine move?
You think you have any moves at all?

29:35.024 --> 29:36.639
You can kill the oni. But me?

29:36.859 --> 29:39.976
Me? I'm a thousand years old.
You can't kill me!

29:40.196 --> 29:41.936
But we can change you.

29:43.908 --> 29:44.988
What?

29:45.243 --> 29:47.074
You forgot about the scroll.

29:47.411 --> 29:48.696
The Shugendo Scroll.

29:53.042 --> 29:54.452
Change the host.

29:54.627 --> 29:56.538
You can't be a fox and a wolf.

31:50.910 --> 31:52.775
Oh, God, I fainted, didn't I?

31:56.957 --> 31:58.367
We're alive.

31:59.418 --> 32:00.749
We all alive?

32:03.923 --> 32:06.414
Yeah. We're okay.

32:34.078 --> 32:36.865
Does it hurt you as much as it hurts me?

32:38.749 --> 32:40.080
Yeah.

32:49.510 --> 32:50.625
It's okay.

32:54.348 --> 32:57.465
Lydia never believed
I was one of the good guys anyway.

33:01.272 --> 33:02.728
She'll believe me.

34:49.922 --> 34:52.129
I wish I could say something to him.

34:54.760 --> 34:57.467
I wish I could say something to all of them.

35:01.725 --> 35:04.307
But I don't how much space or how much
time I'm supposed to give them.

35:05.354 --> 35:07.595
And I know I'm still
just the new girl at school.

35:07.856 --> 35:11.098
You ever run track? I mean, you have
excellent muscle definition.

35:11.694 --> 35:12.900
Not for long.

35:13.070 --> 35:15.152
I sometimes ran
from cougars trying to eat me.

35:15.322 --> 35:18.189
I've had the same problem.
So, listen, we're gonna start off slow.

35:18.409 --> 35:20.445
You know, a few classes here and there.

35:21.495 --> 35:23.577
Don't worry. You'll learn fast.

35:24.039 --> 35:25.575
I intend to.

35:35.759 --> 35:37.795
It's okay. Don't think about it too much.

35:38.012 --> 35:40.048
Just try to let it happen.

35:46.437 --> 35:48.598
- Ah, wow!
- Oh, I am so sorry.

35:52.901 --> 35:54.152
I'm sorry.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.485
I just don't think I can stay.

35:58.365 --> 35:59.866
Actually, it's okay.

36:01.577 --> 36:03.363
You're breaking up with me?

36:04.288 --> 36:06.244
I... I like you.

36:06.457 --> 36:07.617
A lot.

36:08.292 --> 36:11.455
You're incredibly good-looking.

36:12.921 --> 36:15.583
And smart and sweet. And...

36:20.596 --> 36:22.712
I just don't think I can do it.

36:22.931 --> 36:24.137
Date me?

36:25.392 --> 36:27.053
Date a werewolf.

36:33.067 --> 36:34.147
You knew?

36:34.652 --> 36:36.392
Dude, it's Beacon Hills.

37:10.813 --> 37:11.848
Hey.

37:13.357 --> 37:14.472
What're you doing?

37:18.737 --> 37:20.648
Just clearing my head.

37:41.051 --> 37:42.837
Have you ever heard the term

37:43.721 --> 37:45.177
"regression to the mean"?

37:45.889 --> 37:49.097
- No.
- It's a bit of a technical way of saying

37:50.102 --> 37:52.138
things will always even out.

37:52.354 --> 37:54.094
Like things will always get better?

37:54.314 --> 37:56.566
More like things can't always be bad.

37:57.317 --> 37:59.148
So, no matter how bad things get...

37:59.361 --> 38:00.976
Or how good.

38:02.823 --> 38:05.860
- They always come back to the middle.
- Regression to the mean.

38:07.077 --> 38:09.739
I'm not so sure
that applies to a town like this.

38:09.955 --> 38:10.990
Yes.

38:12.332 --> 38:13.708
You might be right.

38:15.377 --> 38:16.833
It was a dream.

38:18.505 --> 38:20.621
It was actually...
It was more like a nightmare.

38:21.508 --> 38:23.499
Okay. What happened?

38:25.262 --> 38:28.470
It started with these hunters that caught
Peter and me after we left Cora.

38:28.682 --> 38:31.424
It was a family of them
led by a guy named Severo.

38:33.145 --> 38:34.760
They broke into my loft.

38:43.614 --> 38:47.152
Now, my friend,
you're gonna tell us about "Ia loba."

38:49.286 --> 38:51.072
Where is the she-wolf?

38:55.083 --> 38:56.914
You should just go ahead and kill me.

38:57.961 --> 38:59.917
'Cause you're never going to find Cora.

39:00.881 --> 39:02.041
Cora?

39:04.426 --> 39:06.007
Who the hell is Cora?

39:18.232 --> 39:19.688
Where are they?

39:31.203 --> 39:32.534
Light them up!

39:51.807 --> 39:53.013
Who was it?

39:53.267 --> 39:55.007
There's a lot of myths

39:55.185 --> 39:57.471
about how people can be turned
into a werewolf.

39:57.688 --> 40:01.226
Usually a bite.
There's one about rain water.

40:01.441 --> 40:04.774
Drinking rain water
out of the puddle of a werewolf's print.

40:05.445 --> 40:06.855
There's another one.

40:07.072 --> 40:08.733
Can you get turned by a scratch?

40:10.284 --> 40:12.570
If the claws go deep enough.

40:13.287 --> 40:14.322
Maybe.

40:20.043 --> 40:22.910
Derek, if this is all just a dream,
why do you look so worried?

40:25.215 --> 40:27.376
Because I don't remember waking up.

40:27.593 --> 40:29.925
So tell me. How do you know?

40:30.095 --> 40:32.211
How do you know if you're still dreaming?

40:32.431 --> 40:34.387
Your fingers,
in dreams you have extra fingers.

40:48.822 --> 40:50.107
It's real.

40:55.704 --> 40:57.285
You're real.

41:00.542 --> 41:02.157
That's right, Derek.

41:02.377 --> 41:06.211
And if seeing me is a surprise, watch this.
