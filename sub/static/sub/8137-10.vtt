00:23.156 --> 00:26.182
When I saw him today, he shot
past me like I was a stranger.

00:26.359 --> 00:27.656
What else
could be affected?

00:27.727 --> 00:30.355
His memory modules,
information banks.

00:30.430 --> 00:32.625
Losing one's memory
is so embarrassing.

00:32.698 --> 00:35.133
You see, there's this guy
looking for you named Michael.

00:35.201 --> 00:36.190
He says you're his.

00:36.269 --> 00:37.258
What does he look like?

00:37.337 --> 00:38.326
KITT?

00:38.405 --> 00:39.394
We're coming to the edge.

00:39.472 --> 00:41.269
Turbo Boost. Press.

00:43.209 --> 00:45.006
KITT!

00:45.078 --> 00:47.376
Move, or I refuse
to be responsible.

01:05.131 --> 01:06.325
Knight Rider...

01:06.399 --> 01:10.301
a shadowy flight into the
dangerous world of a man...

01:10.370 --> 01:12.065
who does not exist.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.014
Michael Knight,
a young loner...

01:22.082 --> 01:24.607
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:24.684 --> 01:26.948
the helpless, the powerless...

01:27.020 --> 01:30.251
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

03:07.787 --> 03:11.382
You know, KITT, sometimes
I feel a little guilty.

03:11.457 --> 03:12.719
Why is that, Michael?

03:12.792 --> 03:16.853
Well, here we are on our way to
the beach, a full afternoon off.

03:17.330 --> 03:20.265
Bonnie and Devon are going to
watch a building being leveled.

03:20.333 --> 03:24.497
If you feel so guilty, why didn't you
accept Devon's invitation to go with them?

03:24.571 --> 03:26.539
Guilty, yes. Crazy, no.

03:28.408 --> 03:30.899
Normally, a building
this size would require...

03:30.977 --> 03:33.468
more than 1,000 pounds
of dynamite to bring down.

03:33.546 --> 03:37.448
However, with the development
of our new XPL nitro-plastique...

03:37.517 --> 03:41.044
we can accomplish the same job
with just six of these packets...

03:41.120 --> 03:43.884
weighing a total of 30 ounces.

03:44.724 --> 03:48.091
Today, we are fortunate enough
to be joined by Mr. Devon Miles...

03:48.161 --> 03:50.129
of The Foundation
for Law and Government.

03:50.196 --> 03:52.323
You're on.
So I am.

03:54.367 --> 03:56.665
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.226
In today's world...

03:58.304 --> 04:02.434
something as powerful as nitro-plastique
isn't simply an explosive.

04:02.775 --> 04:04.868
In the wrong hands,
it's a weapon.

04:15.588 --> 04:18.351
We at the Foundation
welcome the opportunity...

04:18.423 --> 04:22.622
to work with private industry toward
developing adequate safeguards.

04:23.296 --> 04:24.923
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.625
It's all yours, Ms. Jordon.

04:26.699 --> 04:29.133
And now for the event
we've all been waiting for.

04:29.202 --> 04:31.193
It's 15 seconds
to detonation.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.865
Bobby, this better work.
It'll work.

04:36.976 --> 04:40.309
Five, four, three...

04:40.880 --> 04:43.212
two, one.

04:50.823 --> 04:53.758
Don't even think it.
Drop the belts now! Drop them!

04:59.365 --> 05:01.026
Get out of there.

05:02.101 --> 05:03.500
Right there.

05:05.305 --> 05:08.672
How do we know it's the stuff?
It's the stuff. Let's go.

05:08.741 --> 05:12.472
Stay put
or kiss the holidays goodbye.

05:43.710 --> 05:45.337
Devon's calling.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.612
Yo, Devon.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.205
Michael, the demolition site
has just been robbed.

05:50.283 --> 05:52.774
Two men made off with a
quantity of that new explosive.

05:52.852 --> 05:55.616
The police are in pursuit, but
if you're anywhere in the area...

05:55.688 --> 05:58.156
I would like you to assist
in any way possible.

05:58.257 --> 06:00.088
All right,
what am I looking for?

06:00.159 --> 06:03.253
A red wagon with "Bob's
Plumbing Supply" on the side.

06:03.329 --> 06:05.797
Did you get a make on
the plate? Incomplete.

06:05.865 --> 06:08.800
Only the first three digits,
I'm afraid. 187.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.127
187.

06:10.636 --> 06:14.470
KITT, pick up the police frequency
and plot an intercept course, will you?

06:14.540 --> 06:15.666
Right away, Michael.

06:15.742 --> 06:17.471
Okay, Devon, I'll be in touch.

06:17.543 --> 06:21.240
Oh, yes, and thanks
for the afternoon off.

06:32.825 --> 06:34.793
You know
why I like you, Julius?

06:34.861 --> 06:38.388
Because next to you even
I look good. A comedian.

06:38.531 --> 06:41.898
You're too good for this line of work.
You belong on Saturday Night Live.

06:45.104 --> 06:46.731
How are we doing, KITT?

06:46.806 --> 06:50.242
I have the target vehicle's location,
direction, and approximate speed.

06:50.309 --> 06:53.437
That's heading into the
Kirkland Dam area. Correct.

06:53.513 --> 06:58.314
All right, we'll go as far as Temple Road.
We'll try to intercept at Needles Ridge.

07:14.200 --> 07:18.102
Michael, my monitor.
I see them, pal. I see them.

07:39.492 --> 07:40.857
Behind us.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.818
What is it? A cop?

07:42.895 --> 07:46.023
No, some joker in a black
T-top. Let's dust him.

07:57.477 --> 08:01.641
KITT, this guy's really cooking.
Let's see what we're dealing with here.

08:03.049 --> 08:04.949
They appear to be
burning something more...

08:05.017 --> 08:07.247
than your average
unleaded premium, Michael.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.812
The emissions indicate
nitrous oxide. That's okay.

08:11.657 --> 08:14.251
Let's show them
what high octane is all about.

08:29.675 --> 08:32.576
I thought you said nothing on
the street could touch this thing.

08:32.645 --> 08:35.239
Maybe he's not
just a joker after all.

08:49.829 --> 08:52.923
Come on, Bobby. Do something
and drop this guy.

08:59.071 --> 09:02.734
You know, if this doesn't stop
him, you gotta pull over...

09:03.276 --> 09:06.575
and put your hands up, pal,
because the man is holy.

10:09.075 --> 10:10.167
KITT?

10:12.011 --> 10:13.808
You all right, buddy?

10:18.851 --> 10:21.046
KITT, say something to me,
will you?

10:21.454 --> 10:24.287
I am Knight Industries...

10:24.824 --> 10:27.156
I am a... I...

10:28.094 --> 10:30.790
Would you please
repeat the question?

10:31.831 --> 10:32.957
KITT.

10:38.404 --> 10:39.769
All right.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.471
I'll come back
for you.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.685
You stay right here.
I'll be right back.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.476
KITT?

11:28.287 --> 11:29.276
KITT?

11:32.158 --> 11:33.147
KITT?

12:16.669 --> 12:18.034
He made us.

12:18.104 --> 12:20.572
He made us!
Bobby, it's a kid.

12:20.639 --> 12:22.664
What are you doing, Bobby?

13:05.651 --> 13:07.676
He's gotta be
around here somewhere.

13:07.753 --> 13:10.813
Yeah, but where?
He's like a jackrabbit.

13:11.991 --> 13:14.585
Let's forget it.
It's only a kid.

13:14.860 --> 13:17.988
You say that like kids don't
count, like kids can't testify.

13:18.063 --> 13:19.496
Bobby, don't be crazy.

13:19.565 --> 13:22.500
You can't go around killing people
because of what they might've seen.

13:22.568 --> 13:26.060
Relax, okay? Be calm.
You're too hyper.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.918
I'm warning you, Mr. Knight. You're
leaving against medical advice.

13:43.989 --> 13:47.152
Nurse Gilmore, I appreciate all
you've done, but, really, I am fine.

13:47.226 --> 13:50.525
If you're so fine, why were
you found half unconscious...

13:50.596 --> 13:53.429
babbling something about your
car driving off by itself?

13:53.499 --> 13:57.026
Thanks you so much. You are
a credit to your profession.

14:07.146 --> 14:11.640
Well, I see you've been discharged.
"Discharged"? "Escaped" is more like it.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.945
What about KITT? Any luck?
I'm afraid not, Michael.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.682
The voltage surge must have
knocked out his homing device.

14:17.756 --> 14:19.883
Don't be surprised
if that's not all.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.619
What else could be affected?

14:22.828 --> 14:25.729
His memory modules,
information banks.

14:26.265 --> 14:29.200
Michael, how could you?
He's out there damaged, alone.

14:29.268 --> 14:32.431
Bonnie, give me a break. I took
a pretty good shot, too, remember?

14:32.504 --> 14:34.165
Look, I didn't lose him
on purpose.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.367
Now, I'm convinced he's out
there somewhere in the hills.

14:36.442 --> 14:38.069
I'm gonna need a vehicle,
a four-wheel drive.

14:38.143 --> 14:40.407
Michael, we're doing everything
possible to find KITT...

14:40.479 --> 14:44.882
but at the moment, our top priority
is locating the stolen nitro-plastique.

14:44.950 --> 14:47.043
Enough was taken
to level this entire city.

14:47.119 --> 14:49.383
Maybe that's your top priority,
but mine's finding KITT.

14:49.455 --> 14:50.945
Let the police
look for the explosives.

14:51.023 --> 14:53.184
Look, under other circumstances,
I would agree with you.

14:53.259 --> 14:56.626
I would tell you, "Go out. Find
KITT. Don't come back until you do."

14:56.695 --> 14:59.425
But this is different.
This is an order.

15:02.234 --> 15:06.102
Yes? Oh, I see. Good.

15:08.107 --> 15:11.804
The Foundation helicopter has
located the wagon, abandoned.

15:59.091 --> 16:01.651
Let go of me! I didn't do
anything! Get your hands off me!

16:01.727 --> 16:03.957
Easy, I'm not
gonna hurt you.

16:04.029 --> 16:06.725
Then let go of me! I didn't do
anything... All right, slow down.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.790
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

16:09.835 --> 16:12.827
Afraid of you? I'm sure.
Why did you run?

16:14.340 --> 16:15.864
Because I thought
you were the game warden.

16:15.941 --> 16:18.341
He's always trying to bust me
for fishing in the reservoir.

16:18.410 --> 16:21.868
I'm not the game warden, okay?
My name is Michael Knight.

16:21.947 --> 16:24.108
I work for The Foundation
for Law and Government.

16:24.183 --> 16:27.914
I get it. A cop. No, I'm
not a cop, not even close.

16:30.255 --> 16:31.882
What's your name?

16:32.591 --> 16:34.650
Doug. Why?

16:35.060 --> 16:38.860
It's good to meet you,
Doug. You play ball? Yeah.

16:39.064 --> 16:43.501
"WW," is that the name of your team?
Wainwright Warriors. I play shortstop.

16:43.569 --> 16:46.129
No kidding.
I used to play first base.

16:46.205 --> 16:47.797
Yeah, must have been
a long time ago.

16:47.873 --> 16:50.933
Yeah, there were dinosaurs
in the outfield.

16:52.811 --> 16:55.803
Doug, what do you know
about the wagon over there?

16:55.948 --> 16:58.246
Well, I didn't rip it off,
if that's what you mean.

16:58.317 --> 17:00.615
The speakers are thrashed,
but the tape deck's all right.

17:00.686 --> 17:03.712
I was just hoping you saw the
two guys who left it there.

17:03.789 --> 17:06.155
I didn't see anybody.
You're sure?

17:06.224 --> 17:08.386
Yeah, what is this? I thought
you said you weren't a cop.

17:08.460 --> 17:10.290
If you did see them,
you'd tell me, wouldn't you?

17:10.362 --> 17:12.387
These aren't the kind of guys
you wanna protect.

17:12.464 --> 17:14.694
Look, I'm not protecting
anybody. I gotta go.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.997
I guess you didn't see a
black T-top, either, did you?

17:17.069 --> 17:21.403
No. Look, if you're finished with the
interrogation, I've got better things to do.

17:23.342 --> 17:25.173
Thanks for your help.

18:04.983 --> 18:06.541
Who's in there?

18:10.889 --> 18:12.789
Look, where did you come from?

18:22.134 --> 18:25.297
Look, I don't like anybody
tailing me, so bug off!

18:52.264 --> 18:54.425
Help me.

19:05.244 --> 19:07.178
KITT's more than
my partner, Devon.

19:07.246 --> 19:10.477
Come on. He's a friend. You gotta
let me go out and look for him.

19:10.549 --> 19:12.779
Not until we find
the nitro-plastique.

19:12.851 --> 19:15.115
We don't even know what these
guys are driving anymore...

19:15.187 --> 19:17.485
who they are, why they're
here, what they want.

19:17.556 --> 19:19.421
In spite of the fact
that they've switched cars...

19:19.491 --> 19:22.085
we have reason to believe that
they're still in the Kirkland area.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.788
Show him, Bonnie.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.631
Do you recognize him?
No, should I?

19:30.702 --> 19:32.260
His name is Conrad Marrs.

19:32.337 --> 19:35.363
He's one of the premier
explosives men in the business.

19:35.440 --> 19:38.432
So? So he flew in from
Dallas this morning.

19:38.510 --> 19:42.241
Of course, it may be a coincidence,
Michael, but if you believe that...

19:42.314 --> 19:46.341
stay away from people selling bridges
in Brooklyn or swampland in Florida.

19:46.418 --> 19:49.285
Thanks for the advice.
Any idea where he's staying?

19:49.354 --> 19:51.822
That's what we're trying
to find out now.

19:51.890 --> 19:56.054
Michael, have you any leads?
I mean, anything at all?

19:56.395 --> 19:59.387
No. Well, not really.

20:00.065 --> 20:03.364
What? I'm not sure. It's
just a feeling I have.

20:03.435 --> 20:06.029
I ran into this kid
up near the abandoned wagon.

20:06.104 --> 20:08.971
Now, he said he was scared because
he thought I was the game warden.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.771
Well, he was scared, all right,
but it wasn't for that reason.

20:11.843 --> 20:14.710
Do you think he might've seen
the thieves? I'm not sure.

20:14.780 --> 20:17.806
The more I think about it,
the more convinced I am...

20:17.883 --> 20:19.077
he saw something.

20:27.492 --> 20:30.359
Well, you'll be
safe here for a while.

20:30.429 --> 20:33.091
If anybody comes, all you have
to do is just back into the cave.

20:33.165 --> 20:35.963
Good idea. I'm sorry
I frightened you earlier.

20:36.034 --> 20:37.365
You didn't scare me.

20:37.436 --> 20:41.395
Under normal circumstances, I
would've introduced myself first...

20:41.473 --> 20:44.840
but I'm afraid these aren't
exactly normal circumstances.

20:44.943 --> 20:49.073
You can say that again. I could,
yes, but is there any need to?

20:49.147 --> 20:51.206
No. No, that's not
what I mean.

20:53.185 --> 20:54.550
Forget it.

20:55.187 --> 20:58.122
A talking car, if that's not
a mind blower...

20:58.690 --> 21:01.716
I seem to recall I can do
a lot of other things, too.

21:01.793 --> 21:05.889
If I could only remember what they
are. What do you do for instance?

21:05.964 --> 21:10.867
For instance, well, if I don't feel
like going to school, I just split.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.901
But how do you learn anything
if you split school?

21:13.972 --> 21:18.705
I don't learn anything in school, anyway,
not about real life. So tell me something.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.473
Do you always just follow behind
people, or does someone get inside?

21:21.546 --> 21:22.877
Let's find out.

21:33.091 --> 21:36.822
Wow! Look at this dashboard!

21:37.129 --> 21:42.066
Your own TV, all these buttons.
What are all these buttons for?

21:42.801 --> 21:46.464
"Pursuit, Scanner,
X-ray, Infra-ray."

21:47.773 --> 21:50.708
"Turbo Boost"?
Don't touch Turbo Boost.

21:50.776 --> 21:54.041
Something tells me you
shouldn't touch Turbo Boost.

21:54.880 --> 21:58.213
How about "Eject"? "Right"
and "Left"? I don't recall.

21:58.283 --> 22:00.376
Well, there's just one way
to find out, isn't there?

22:06.158 --> 22:07.955
Wow, it's like a rocket!

22:08.093 --> 22:11.585
It is rather remarkable, isn't it? Yeah.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.191
I'm impressed.

22:17.636 --> 22:19.968
I know guys who've been in
the business for 20 years...

22:20.038 --> 22:21.903
and even they can't get
their hands on this stuff.

22:21.973 --> 22:24.737
Well, we're not exactly
amateurs, pal. Good.

22:24.810 --> 22:27.802
Then I'll give you a real
professional explosion, a symphony.

22:27.879 --> 22:30.177
Yeah, well, just don't get
carried away, all right?

22:30.248 --> 22:32.409
All we need is a nice,
civil emergency.

22:32.484 --> 22:36.113
Just enough to knock out the power, and
draw the police, fire, and emergency units.

22:36.188 --> 22:39.453
And while they're going crazy trying
to handle the traffic, the evacuation...

22:39.524 --> 22:42.687
and 1,000 haywire alarms,
we hit the museum.

22:42.994 --> 22:45.986
$15 mill worth
of pre-Columbian artifacts.

22:49.801 --> 22:51.928
Well, the dam's no problem.

22:53.105 --> 22:56.597
Your basic earth-fill with
concrete and steel reinforcement.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.471
This quadrant here
ought to do it.

22:58.543 --> 23:01.842
It should create a spill of
about 900 million gallons...

23:01.913 --> 23:03.881
weaken the rest of the dam
enough to worry them.

23:03.949 --> 23:08.215
All right, then. We're set for
tomorrow? I'll need an hour's notice.

23:08.587 --> 23:09.747
You know
where to reach me.

23:09.821 --> 23:12.949
By the way, did you happen to
see a kid on the way up here?

23:13.024 --> 23:14.082
What kid?

23:14.159 --> 23:16.593
Well, when we ditched the car,
this kid saw us.

23:16.661 --> 23:20.927
Are you telling me somebody
made you? No. Not exactly.

23:20.999 --> 23:23.934
I thought you told me
you weren't amateurs.

23:24.870 --> 23:27.805
You know why I'm the best?
It's because I'm careful.

23:29.474 --> 23:31.237
We'll find the kid.

23:31.476 --> 23:35.310
By morning, or I'm gone.
Believe it.

23:42.154 --> 23:43.815
I don't believe you, Bobby.

23:43.889 --> 23:47.188
We got this guy in our pocket, and you
ask him if he saw a kid on the way up.

23:47.259 --> 23:51.059
So now we gotta find the kid! That's all.
We should've done it, anyway. It's cleaner.

24:13.518 --> 24:16.009
Help you?
Yeah, I hope so.

24:16.087 --> 24:18.851
I'm looking for the sponsor of
a youth-league baseball team.

24:18.924 --> 24:22.416
Sorry, we've already got one.
In first place, too.

24:24.229 --> 24:26.857
Wainwright Warriors?
That's right.

24:27.199 --> 24:31.499
I'm looking for a boy named Doug.
He plays shortstop. Do you know him?

24:31.937 --> 24:33.564
He's my son, Doug Wainwright.

24:33.638 --> 24:35.902
No kidding. Look, I need
to talk to him. Is he here?

24:35.974 --> 24:38.272
Just what's this
all about, anyway?

24:38.343 --> 24:42.370
No, it's all right, Jim. Why don't
you help that customer over there?

24:46.351 --> 24:49.320
All right, what's he done
this time? Who are you?

24:49.387 --> 24:52.788
My name is Michael Knight. I work for
The Foundation for Law and Government.

24:52.858 --> 24:54.826
We're trying to locate
some stolen explosives...

24:54.893 --> 24:57.589
and we think your boy
may have seen something.

24:57.662 --> 25:00.153
Can you tell me
how I can find him?

25:00.632 --> 25:02.259
Well, he's probably
in the hills.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.734
He and his father used to hike
up there, and they found a cave.

25:04.803 --> 25:06.566
He's been spending
a lot of time there lately.

25:06.638 --> 25:10.301
Would you mind giving me
directions? It's very important.

25:12.711 --> 25:15.441
Well, I think I better
draw you a map.

25:15.714 --> 25:17.909
Hope you can draw
better than I do.

25:19.317 --> 25:22.753
Is something wrong? No, I just
gotta get home. That's all.

25:22.821 --> 25:24.379
What's "home"?

25:25.357 --> 25:27.348
That's a place where...

25:28.026 --> 25:31.086
I don't know. Where you go when
there's no place else to go.

25:31.162 --> 25:34.154
"Home" doesn't sound like
much fun. No, it used to be.

25:34.232 --> 25:35.722
What happened?

25:36.902 --> 25:41.271
Well, you see, my dad got real
sick. Everyone said he'd be okay.

25:43.141 --> 25:44.540
Forget it.

25:44.809 --> 25:47.778
So you gonna be okay or what?
I'll be fine.

25:47.846 --> 25:50.474
And I think my memory
is improving. Well, good.

25:50.549 --> 25:53.484
I'll be back tonight, late,
when everyone else is asleep.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.180
That sounds like fun.
Goodbye, Elliot.

25:57.355 --> 25:58.982
Doug. My name's Doug.

25:59.057 --> 26:01.525
Then who's Elliot?
How do I know?

26:01.893 --> 26:03.520
I thought your memory
was getting better.

26:03.595 --> 26:06.723
Yes, well, at least
it's not getting any worse.

26:24.282 --> 26:25.943
Julius, there he is.

26:31.323 --> 26:32.984
We'll cut him off.

26:37.329 --> 26:38.660
KITT, they're after me!

26:38.730 --> 26:40.129
Who?
Those two guys.

26:40.198 --> 26:41.392
Get in.

26:41.466 --> 26:43.559
Can you drive?
Are you kidding?

26:43.635 --> 26:46.433
I can drive anything on
wheels. Where's the ignition?

26:46.504 --> 26:50.634
On second thought, there are still
a few things I remember. Hold on.

26:53.878 --> 26:55.470
KITT!

26:56.381 --> 26:58.906
Wow!

27:01.052 --> 27:03.282
That's him in the black T-top.

27:46.131 --> 27:48.065
KITT! KITT!

27:54.739 --> 27:56.673
We're coming to the edge.
I noticed.

27:56.741 --> 27:58.606
What are we going to do?
Why are you asking me?

27:58.677 --> 28:00.235
Turbo Boost, I remember.

28:00.311 --> 28:02.438
But you told me
to never to press Turbo Boost.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.345
I've changed my mind.

28:08.019 --> 28:09.884
Press!

28:20.331 --> 28:21.992
Did you see that?

28:27.939 --> 28:30.931
I'd swear that's the same
idiot who chased us before.

29:37.742 --> 29:40.404
KITT, it's me Michael.
You hear me?

29:41.880 --> 29:43.006
KITT?

29:44.282 --> 29:45.271
KITT?

29:45.650 --> 29:47.550
KITT, it's me, Michael!

29:48.119 --> 29:49.882
KITT!

30:00.698 --> 30:02.666
I have the strangest feeling.

30:02.734 --> 30:05.032
I know. That you've
done this before, too?

30:05.103 --> 30:08.004
I have that awareness also.
This is different.

30:08.072 --> 30:10.939
I have the strangest feeling
someone is calling my name.

30:11.009 --> 30:14.775
Don't worry, KITT. I'm gonna
hide you in a safe place.

30:16.514 --> 30:17.640
What's this?

30:19.551 --> 30:20.779
No way!

30:24.823 --> 30:26.757
All right!

30:31.496 --> 30:35.432
I didn't know they made cars
like this. I'm not sure they do.

30:35.600 --> 30:38.763
KITT, you are radical.
If you say so.

30:41.072 --> 30:42.471
What's this?

30:53.184 --> 30:56.847
How hungry are you?
What? Not very.

30:57.622 --> 30:59.988
Your mother went to a lot
of trouble to fix this.

31:00.058 --> 31:01.616
It's all right.

31:05.597 --> 31:08.395
Oh, no. I wonder who that
could be. I'll get it.

31:12.270 --> 31:15.569
Hi, I hope I'm not
interrupting dinner. You are.

31:15.640 --> 31:18.302
Well, in that case,
I apologize. Doug home?

31:18.376 --> 31:22.972
Just what do you want with him? I'd
like to ask him a couple of questions.

31:23.348 --> 31:25.908
Lori's husband died
just little over a year ago.

31:25.984 --> 31:29.579
She's been through a lot, and I'm here
to see no one takes advantage of her.

31:29.654 --> 31:32.714
I appreciate your concern, but
maybe I didn't make myself clear.

31:32.790 --> 31:35.850
I'm not here to see Lori.
I'm here to see Doug.

31:37.428 --> 31:39.328
I've got my eye on you.

31:49.107 --> 31:50.506
Okay, ask away.

31:50.575 --> 31:53.544
Doug, before we start, I'm
sorry it has to be this way.

31:53.645 --> 31:54.976
What's that supposed to mean?

31:55.046 --> 31:57.913
It means it's tough enough
person to person.

32:01.953 --> 32:04.888
But the men I'm looking for, I
think you saw them this afternoon.

32:04.956 --> 32:07.083
They were chasing you,
and you were in a black T-top.

32:07.158 --> 32:09.854
Now, wait just a minute. The
kid's 14. He can't even drive.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.759
I can, too. Look,
what do you know, anyway?

32:11.829 --> 32:13.797
Don't yell at me.
I'm trying to protect you.

32:13.865 --> 32:15.264
Jim, please.

32:15.433 --> 32:18.732
You satisfied? Trying to have a
nice, quiet family dinner here...

32:18.803 --> 32:20.794
and, thanks to you, people
are yelling at each other.

32:20.872 --> 32:24.330
Yeah, well, it's not a family dinner
'cause you're not part of the family.

32:28.413 --> 32:31.246
I'm sorry. Ever since
his father died...

32:32.884 --> 32:35.512
I'm sorry about that,
but I had to ask.

32:35.586 --> 32:38.419
Just take it easy,
will you? Yeah, right.

32:45.063 --> 32:47.691
We know where Conrad Marrs
is staying.

32:49.834 --> 32:53.167
That's all? An address? What would
you prefer? An arrest warrant?

32:53.237 --> 32:55.933
A grand jury indictment? Now
that you mention it, yeah.

32:56.007 --> 32:57.804
I mean, why not something
tangible for a change?

32:57.875 --> 33:00.309
Because the police still
consider that Marrs is clean.

33:00.378 --> 33:02.346
Innocent until
proven guilty and all that.

33:02.413 --> 33:05.541
Well, that rings a bell. What am I
supposed to do? Take him out to dinner?

33:05.616 --> 33:10.019
I leave the details to you. Now, we know
that Marrs is an extremely cautious man.

33:10.088 --> 33:13.182
If he decides to bail out, this
whole operation could collapse.

33:13.257 --> 33:15.248
Any luck with the boy?
Doug?

33:15.326 --> 33:18.489
I'm sure he's lying. I tell you one
thing. He was the one in KITT, all right.

33:18.563 --> 33:21.589
In that case, I'd recommend
a stakeout. Next on my list.

33:21.666 --> 33:23.156
Whatever that boy's
got in mind...

33:23.234 --> 33:25.930
he's gonna wait until the house
is asleep before he leaves.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.495
Now, I figure I got
a couple of hours yet.

33:28.573 --> 33:30.700
I know the Foundation
commitments come first...

33:30.775 --> 33:33.608
but I'm telling you.
I am worried about KITT.

33:33.711 --> 33:36.737
When I saw him today, he shot
past me like I was a stranger.

33:36.814 --> 33:40.545
You were. Excuse me.
By all means.

33:40.618 --> 33:44.418
Perhaps you can make him understand.
I'm a scientist, not a miracle worker.

33:44.489 --> 33:47.390
For you. Don't tell me.
This is KITT's new memory.

33:47.458 --> 33:51.827
Absolutely. New and improved with
5,000 megabits of added information.

33:52.196 --> 33:56.656
The only problem will be to get close
enough to his CPU service port to install it.

33:56.734 --> 33:59.202
Sounds Freudian. Where's that?

33:59.270 --> 34:03.263
Facing KITT, it's eight inches left
of the power shift on the transmission.

34:03.341 --> 34:05.036
In other words, under KITT.

34:05.109 --> 34:09.773
In other words, but don't worry. Some of
us spend a lot of time working under KITT.

34:09.847 --> 34:12.440
Not when he doesn't know
who you are.

34:25.596 --> 34:27.688
Honey, hurry up. It's here.

34:36.107 --> 34:37.369
Hi.

34:37.574 --> 34:38.563
Hi.

34:39.077 --> 34:43.070
Where do I sign?
Where do you wanna sign?

34:44.348 --> 34:48.011
For the champagne. Aren't
you from the liquor store?

34:48.085 --> 34:52.284
No, not exactly.
I'm here to see Conrad.

34:52.356 --> 34:54.016
He's taking a shower.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.925
You mind if I wait?
Angel, you got a problem?

34:56.994 --> 35:00.657
I tell you what. Let's have a little fun
with him. Tell him I need his signature.

35:00.731 --> 35:04.223
He won't get mad? Connie?
Come on. He's a real fun guy.

35:04.302 --> 35:05.564
Come on.

35:07.371 --> 35:08.497
Okay.

35:10.041 --> 35:12.908
Honey, he says he needs
your signature.

35:18.783 --> 35:22.048
Hello, Conrad.
Who is this guy?

35:23.888 --> 35:26.379
He's a friend of yours.
Aren't you?

35:28.759 --> 35:31.626
Where are they? I don't know
what you're talking about.

35:31.696 --> 35:34.221
You're in my room, cowboy.
Get out. There are two of them.

35:34.298 --> 35:37.392
They stole some experimental
explosives called nitro-plastique.

35:37.468 --> 35:41.370
They run around town in a supercharged
four-wheel drive. And they hired you.

35:41.439 --> 35:45.102
I'm not for hire. I'm on vacation,
and you're still in my room.

35:45.176 --> 35:47.406
Do yourself a favor. Go home.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.814
Think before you swing.

35:51.916 --> 35:55.010
Who are you? Just a guy
who knows who you are.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.319
Be careful...

35:59.290 --> 36:01.622
'cause somebody's
watching you.

36:08.266 --> 36:11.565
I thought he was a friend
of yours. Pack my stuff.

36:38.496 --> 36:39.690
Doug?

36:42.600 --> 36:43.589
Doug?

37:41.025 --> 37:43.391
So who do you think he is?
Who?

37:43.661 --> 37:45.959
The guy who chased Conrad
out of town.

37:46.030 --> 37:47.497
I don't know.

37:47.565 --> 37:50.830
We don't need Conrad now that
he's told us all we gotta know.

37:50.901 --> 37:52.630
I just hope we can
find that kid.

37:52.703 --> 37:56.139
This place sponsors the team. The kid's
got a jacket. The kid's on the team.

38:16.427 --> 38:17.758
Julius.
What?

38:17.828 --> 38:19.591
You won't believe this.
It's him. It's the kid.

38:19.664 --> 38:21.689
Where?
Right over there.

38:24.535 --> 38:28.528
KITT, don't be scared. It's
just me, Doug. Hello, Doug.

38:30.007 --> 38:32.271
Hi, KITT.
How you doing? Okay?

38:33.010 --> 38:36.741
I've been thinking about what
you said, Doug, about home.

38:36.947 --> 38:39.472
Yeah, what about it?
Do I have one?

38:40.985 --> 38:43.215
Well, I was gonna
tell you, anyway.

38:43.287 --> 38:46.688
You see, there's this guy
looking for you named Michael.

38:46.757 --> 38:48.918
He says you're his.
Really?

38:49.093 --> 38:50.754
What does he look like?

38:50.828 --> 38:53.854
I don't know. He's older.
Kind of tall.

38:54.432 --> 38:57.890
I guess he's all right. He was
looking for you around the dam.

38:57.968 --> 39:01.199
What's a "dam"? You
don't know what a dam is?

39:02.239 --> 39:04.469
I keep forgetting
about your memory.

39:04.542 --> 39:08.069
A dam is a big thing that holds
water. I thought that was a bathtub.

39:08.145 --> 39:09.942
Well, it's a little bigger
than a bathtub.

39:10.014 --> 39:12.278
Losing one's memory
is so embarrassing.

40:10.274 --> 40:11.263
KITT?

40:11.909 --> 40:13.843
KITT, it's me, Michael.

40:20.851 --> 40:24.343
How are you doing, buddy?
I've been worried about you.

40:24.922 --> 40:26.822
Do we know each other?

40:26.957 --> 40:30.688
Know each other? Butch know
Sundance? Smith know Wesson?

40:30.761 --> 40:32.524
Abbott know Costello?

40:33.664 --> 40:37.156
I'd prefer it if you'd kindly
keep your hands to yourself.

40:37.234 --> 40:41.102
Look, we don't have the time, pal.
Doug's been kidnapped. He needs us.

40:53.217 --> 40:55.708
Please remove yourself
from my path.

40:55.786 --> 40:56.844
No.

40:58.656 --> 41:01.284
Stay away from me.
Sorry, pal.

41:01.358 --> 41:04.327
I'll be forced to push
you aside. Go ahead.

41:05.429 --> 41:08.455
Your dominant program is the
preservation of human life.

41:08.532 --> 41:10.591
What's a "dominant program"?

41:11.101 --> 41:14.468
Don't run over my leg, KITT.
Don't say I didn't warn you.

41:14.605 --> 41:18.803
Don't run over my leg. Move,
or I refuse to be responsible.

41:32.289 --> 41:34.450
KITT?
Michael, is that you?

41:34.792 --> 41:37.488
Yeah, it's me, pal.
Welcome back.

41:38.028 --> 41:41.225
If I may be so bold, what on
earth were you doing down there?

41:41.298 --> 41:43.630
I'll explain later. Right now,
we've gotta try and save Doug.

41:43.701 --> 41:46.602
Doug's my new friend. Where
is he? He was kidnapped.

41:46.670 --> 41:47.694
Kidnapped?

41:47.771 --> 41:50.205
Access your audio banks.
See if you picked up anything.

41:50.274 --> 41:51.639
Good idea.

41:53.444 --> 41:54.934
I think I may have something.

41:55.012 --> 41:58.106
This place sponsors the team.
The kid's got a jacket.

41:58.182 --> 42:01.151
Fast forward. Right there.

42:01.719 --> 42:06.122
No, Julius, this time you listen to
me. If we do it here, it's murder...

42:06.390 --> 42:09.985
but if we take him up to the dam,
and the dam mysteriously explodes...

42:10.060 --> 42:11.891
he's just part
of the natural disaster.

42:11.962 --> 42:15.591
Michael, they're talking
about Doug. I'm afraid so, pal.

42:15.866 --> 42:17.231
Let's go.

43:11.121 --> 43:16.024
So long, kid. If you ever pass
over Saint Louis, make sure to wave.

43:18.162 --> 43:19.288
Okay?

43:22.933 --> 43:24.298
Help me.

43:45.289 --> 43:47.120
All right, KITT,
let's scan the area...

43:47.191 --> 43:48.681
for the four-wheeler...

43:48.759 --> 43:52.126
for Doug or any activity
or any movement.

43:55.132 --> 43:57.191
Michael.
Good work, KITT.

44:06.810 --> 44:10.177
Michael, my monitor.
The nitro-plastique.

44:10.547 --> 44:13.482
How much time is left on the
timer? Just under 30 seconds.

44:13.550 --> 44:16.314
Can we disarm it from here?
I don't think so.

44:16.420 --> 44:19.912
All right, then let's stop the clock.
Full power to the microwave jammer.

44:34.738 --> 44:36.603
Let's get out of here.

44:40.110 --> 44:43.477
Jump in. How'd we do, KITT?
It's in clock heaven.

44:43.547 --> 44:45.515
Hi, KITT.
Hello, Doug.

44:45.949 --> 44:49.248
All right, now for our friends
in the four-wheeler.

44:49.319 --> 44:52.880
Four-wheeler heaven?
No, it's too good for them.

44:53.123 --> 44:55.648
I was thinking more
about jail. Hang on.

45:30.561 --> 45:32.756
All right, KITT, shall we put
these turkeys away?

45:32.830 --> 45:34.889
I thought you'd never ask.

45:34.965 --> 45:39.664
Doug, you wanna do the honors?
Press Turbo Boost.

45:39.937 --> 45:42.098
Okay. One, two, three.

46:14.004 --> 46:15.301
Go ahead.

46:16.106 --> 46:18.233
I don't know. Is it legal?

46:18.609 --> 46:21.635
You're a citizen, aren't
you? Yeah, I guess.

46:24.414 --> 46:25.676
Go ahead.

46:29.453 --> 46:33.150
This is Doug Wainwright, and
I'm making a citizen's arrest.

46:34.758 --> 46:36.089
All right.

46:52.342 --> 46:53.969
He's back
to his old self again.

46:54.044 --> 46:56.945
He even offered to do the dishes
this morning. I was shocked.

46:57.014 --> 46:58.038
I wouldn't count on it.

46:58.115 --> 47:02.552
No, I've been a mother too long. Don't
worry. But it's nice. It felt good.

47:03.754 --> 47:06.245
He is really gonna miss you,
you and KITT.

47:06.323 --> 47:08.348
Well, not for too long.

47:08.859 --> 47:12.351
According to KITT, he promised
to stop back real soon.

47:12.963 --> 47:17.229
You know, I've been doing a lot
of thinking about Doug, about Jim.

47:17.868 --> 47:19.165
I think it's still
too soon.

47:19.236 --> 47:23.434
I think Doug needs more than I can
give him with another man around.

47:24.875 --> 47:26.365
Come here. Bye.
Bye.

47:26.443 --> 47:28.343
Thanks.
It's okay.

47:30.113 --> 47:32.479
Sorry, partner. Got to go.

47:32.549 --> 47:33.880
Just a minute, Michael.

47:33.951 --> 47:35.885
Doug was going to let me
do a project for him.

47:35.953 --> 47:38.444
KITT, never mind.
No, it's all right.

47:38.522 --> 47:40.387
He calls it
"homework," Michael.

47:40.457 --> 47:42.891
He wanted to see
how fast I could do it.

47:42.960 --> 47:44.757
Well, it was worth a shot.

47:44.828 --> 47:48.229
I was just telling KITT maybe I'd start
going to school a little more often.

47:48.298 --> 47:50.732
Take care of yourself, pal.
Okay.

47:51.301 --> 47:53.064
Don't forget to come by.

47:53.136 --> 47:55.036
I'll see
he doesn't forget, Doug.

47:55.105 --> 47:58.541
Now that I've got my memory
back, you can count on me.

47:59.509 --> 48:01.272
Straight ahead, pal.
