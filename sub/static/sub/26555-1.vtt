00:17.168 --> 00:21.376
A film by Barbara Albert

00:22.918 --> 00:27.126
Adapted from the novel <i>Mesmerized</i>
by Alissa Walser

00:28.668 --> 00:32.668
Based on a historical occurrence

02:31.876 --> 02:33.376
Smile, Therese.

02:33.585 --> 02:36.376
And don't rock! You're rocking again.

02:37.335 --> 02:41.126
Play another one.
The fast one from Galuppi.

02:41.335 --> 02:44.501
The Marquise of Colloredo
and a host of nobles are here.

02:44.710 --> 02:46.960
You must try your very best.

02:55.960 --> 02:58.585
Pretty she is not,
but she does play well.

02:58.793 --> 03:01.751
Poor girl. How I pity her.

03:08.001 --> 03:11.418
My compliments.
She is a superior talent.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.210
I thank you.

03:32.543 --> 03:34.585
Mademoiselle Jeunehomme is better.

03:35.418 --> 03:37.543
But she is not blind.

04:17.293 --> 04:18.918
Mouth closed.

04:26.126 --> 04:30.043
You played sublimely.
It moved me to tears.

04:30.251 --> 04:32.001
And Gretl, too.

04:32.210 --> 04:35.085
This is my dearest friend,
Margarethe von Fürstenberg.

04:35.585 --> 04:39.085
- She's right next to me.
- Pleased to meet you.

04:39.293 --> 04:41.626
I'm always pleased to meet new people.

04:41.835 --> 04:45.460
My great pleasure.
You played splendidly.

04:45.668 --> 04:46.835
Thank you so much.

04:47.876 --> 04:51.085
- Is your head better?
- Yes, it no longer smells at all.

04:51.793 --> 04:53.835
You could come visit
more often again now.

04:54.043 --> 04:58.668
Children are such effort, even if
they don't need special attention.

04:58.876 --> 05:00.751
Especially girls.

05:00.918 --> 05:04.626
Yes, she even dances.
I taught her that.

05:04.835 --> 05:06.043
<i>Etonnant!</i>

05:06.251 --> 05:08.251
It was some treatment for her eyes.

05:08.501 --> 05:11.876
All her hair fell out,
and her head was covered in puss.

05:12.085 --> 05:13.793
But it is nearly all healed.

05:14.501 --> 05:18.293
I still often have pains,
in my head and my eyes.

05:23.001 --> 05:26.543
But the eyes are no better.
They are rather worse.

06:54.585 --> 06:58.710
Vienna, 1777

07:05.418 --> 07:08.168
- Well, are you happy?
- Yes.

07:08.376 --> 07:11.293
Dr. Mesmer has a lovely house. Very big.

07:11.501 --> 07:12.835
Marrying well is the key.

07:13.001 --> 07:14.918
- With a park!
- No, with smarts,

07:15.126 --> 07:18.918
if you can't cut it alone.
Well, without her he'd be a nobody.

07:21.918 --> 07:26.918
I still can't believe this "caressing"
alone is supposed to work.

07:27.126 --> 07:31.126
It is a fluid that he works with.
Of course you cannot see it.

07:31.335 --> 07:33.960
Or do you see streams of electricity?

07:34.168 --> 07:37.751
- You'd be the first.
- I didn't mean to say he is incapable.

07:37.918 --> 07:41.960
Then be happy he's treating her
and keep quiet. That'd be best.

07:42.751 --> 07:45.418
Resi, be careful. Lean forward a bit.

07:45.626 --> 07:48.293
Or it'll be all squashed in the back.

07:49.376 --> 07:52.543
Lovely, greeted by dogs and cripples.

08:03.876 --> 08:05.751
A little further forward.

08:10.085 --> 08:11.626
Loisl!

08:11.835 --> 08:12.793
Loisl!

08:14.293 --> 08:17.668
- Be gone!
- I most humbly beg forgiveness.

08:19.210 --> 08:21.626
- What was that?
- A little boy, Resi.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.376
An imbecile.

08:30.585 --> 08:32.918
A young lady in the prime of her life,

08:33.126 --> 08:34.835
extremely striking.

08:35.501 --> 08:37.876
The background is sombre,

08:38.085 --> 08:39.710
mysterious.

08:39.876 --> 08:42.043
Perhaps her young.

08:42.251 --> 08:44.960
- Is she beautiful?
- Very beautiful.

08:45.168 --> 08:47.626
- How?
- Well, very graceful.

08:47.835 --> 08:50.043
Big, dark eyes.

08:50.251 --> 08:54.210
A bit moist, as if she's been moved,
internally moved.

08:54.418 --> 08:56.793
Sumptuous curls and a little nose.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.960
A small, closed mouth.

08:59.168 --> 09:01.418
Skin like snow or...

09:01.626 --> 09:03.501
like ivory, perhaps.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.793
Very rosy cheeks.

09:06.001 --> 09:08.043
And gorgeous little hands.

09:09.126 --> 09:10.293
What are you doing?

09:11.210 --> 09:12.418
Stop that!

09:12.626 --> 09:15.668
- It itches.
- It doesn't matter. Don't touch.

09:15.835 --> 09:18.668
Not at all. One cannot be sure
if someone is watching.

09:18.835 --> 09:20.626
You least of all.

09:24.501 --> 09:26.210
What is that?

09:27.460 --> 09:31.210
Something that is keeping him
from gracing us with his presence.

09:31.418 --> 09:34.168
Now we're standing here unattended to.

09:38.876 --> 09:41.001
Well, now he is here.

09:41.210 --> 09:42.210
Welcome!

09:45.085 --> 09:46.585
Mr Paradis.

09:46.793 --> 09:49.001
- Mr von...
- No, no "von".

09:49.210 --> 09:51.085
Mr <i>von</i> Paradis.

09:59.918 --> 10:02.210
- A crisis.
- What sort of illness?

10:02.460 --> 10:03.876
It is intolerable.

10:04.085 --> 10:07.710
It is not an illness.
More like the mode of an illness.

10:08.918 --> 10:11.043
Like the temper of a musical work.

10:11.251 --> 10:13.043
The illness fades

10:13.251 --> 10:14.960
as one's health crescendos.

10:15.168 --> 10:17.418
One hears about these new methods...

10:17.626 --> 10:20.751
I want to stress
that the aim I have set myself

10:20.918 --> 10:24.168
is to calm the eyes
and to relieve the pain.

10:24.418 --> 10:28.001
As I can give you no assurance,
the cure would be at no cost.

10:28.210 --> 10:31.626
We would welcome
even the slightest change.

10:32.376 --> 10:34.668
Everything is better than that.

10:39.543 --> 10:41.960
But she does have talent.

10:42.168 --> 10:44.793
Though that is unrelated,
<i>n 'est-ce pas?</i>

10:44.960 --> 10:49.793
For her talent was given her
via her father's cells from the start.

10:50.001 --> 10:51.626
So you are a spermist?

10:51.835 --> 10:55.543
Are you not?
I am extremely open to new ideas.

10:56.460 --> 11:00.168
Even some men
have become ovulists.

11:00.418 --> 11:01.668
Well, yes.

11:01.835 --> 11:07.251
But our talents are certainly still
held in the male, not the female cell.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.793
With Dr Barth
it was quicksilver and leeches,

11:12.001 --> 11:16.043
with Court Physician Störck
sulphur globe and electrostatic machine:

11:16.251 --> 11:20.835
3,000 shocks in total.
100 in succession, in one sitting.

11:21.043 --> 11:23.460
Directly into the eyes.
Pure torture!

11:24.085 --> 11:26.501
And it did no good.
Quite the contrary.

11:26.710 --> 11:29.835
If it continues,
her eyes will roll before my feet.

11:30.043 --> 11:33.918
- And since then she's lost her smell.
- Her nose is dry as a bone.

11:34.585 --> 11:36.335
And monthly bleeding?

11:38.126 --> 11:39.668
Has not come.

11:39.835 --> 11:43.210
She was not impaired at all at birth.

11:43.460 --> 11:47.043
Until she was three
she was utterly healthy and delightful.

11:47.251 --> 11:50.501
- Then, from one day to the next...
- ...she was stone blind.

11:51.293 --> 11:52.918
She simply got up one morning

11:53.126 --> 11:56.043
and began running into things,
like a bird.

11:56.251 --> 11:59.460
It was a terrible nightmare after that,
a nightmare!

12:00.293 --> 12:04.418
Since then my wife has tried
to be an eye for my daughter.

12:04.626 --> 12:07.043
With all due respect to mothers,

12:07.251 --> 12:09.751
we all know women and their pampering

12:09.918 --> 12:13.460
can often be
a doctor's most dangerous adversary.

12:15.418 --> 12:16.835
Miss Paradis,

12:17.043 --> 12:20.460
do you have any memories whatsoever
of that night?

12:20.668 --> 12:22.085
- No.
- No.

12:22.293 --> 12:23.835
<i>Desolée.</i>

12:25.835 --> 12:29.460
And now, perhaps,
a little demonstration.

12:29.668 --> 12:31.793
We are most curious.

12:33.835 --> 12:35.376
Here's my hand.

12:58.001 --> 13:00.751
I make use of a magnetic fluid

13:01.918 --> 13:05.376
that permeates all animate
and inanimate bodies.

13:07.460 --> 13:09.626
An invisible fluid.

13:09.835 --> 13:11.293
Like gravity.

13:19.460 --> 13:20.876
Bravo.

13:23.626 --> 13:25.043
Bravissimo.

13:26.168 --> 13:28.085
One, two, three, four.

13:28.960 --> 13:30.501
The bed.

13:34.585 --> 13:36.126
Bed stand.

13:38.293 --> 13:42.085
One, two, three, four, five, six.

13:43.710 --> 13:45.168
Paravent.

13:47.126 --> 13:49.126
One, two, three.

13:49.335 --> 13:51.043
Mirror.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.293
Commode.

13:58.126 --> 14:00.251
And here, Resi, look.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.585
The cross.

14:05.043 --> 14:06.460
Rosa!

14:06.668 --> 14:08.501
- <i>Maman!</i>
- Resi!

14:11.918 --> 14:13.543
Now then,

14:13.751 --> 14:15.418
adieu, my child.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.210
We'll be coming back again soon.

14:29.918 --> 14:32.251
- Now don't make such a fuss. Ouch!
- Ouch!

15:29.418 --> 15:32.876
Miss Ossine
missed the washbasin again.

15:33.085 --> 15:36.085
- How is it she can't hit the jug?
- Yes, she does it to spite me.

15:36.293 --> 15:38.835
Sounds like the devil
paid her a visit again.

15:40.460 --> 15:42.835
- Have you got apricots?
- No, they're gone.

15:43.043 --> 15:47.043
- Take her cherries.
- You'll be her chambermaid soon.

15:47.251 --> 15:49.626
- Of a famous girl.
- The poor girl.

15:49.835 --> 15:53.918
No disability pensions for our kind,
even if we cut off our hands and feet.

15:55.001 --> 15:57.460
Ay, without hands
you can't bang a piano.

15:57.668 --> 16:02.501
- You can't even do that with hands.
- So what? Maybe I could if I tried.

16:02.710 --> 16:04.710
Puke-face gets one and she's useless.

16:04.876 --> 16:07.085
That's life.
You have the wrong father.

16:07.293 --> 16:08.960
And so do you.

16:10.085 --> 16:12.293
Go! Hedi, leave him.

16:12.835 --> 16:14.793
- He likes it!
- Hedi!

16:21.001 --> 16:23.501
The cherries look gruesome.

16:24.543 --> 16:26.085
She can't see them anyway.

16:27.251 --> 16:30.543
My! That chocolate sure smells good.

16:53.876 --> 16:56.585
I want to wear the one
with the large bows today.

16:58.543 --> 17:00.210
The festive dress.

17:02.626 --> 17:04.417
The festive dress?

17:04.626 --> 17:07.585
The doctor won't be happy about that.

17:08.460 --> 17:10.792
A simple dress would do.

17:11.001 --> 17:13.251
How would you know that?

17:15.126 --> 17:17.876
- The corset too?
- <i>Yes, naturellement!</i>

17:19.585 --> 17:22.085
I don't know if I can do that so well.

17:27.417 --> 17:29.293
Is the lady next door in great pain?

17:30.251 --> 17:33.376
Miss Ossine?
Because she's always wailing?

17:39.001 --> 17:40.501
No, Miss.

17:40.710 --> 17:42.668
Don't pay that any mind.

17:45.460 --> 17:47.210
How should I put it?

17:47.960 --> 17:49.710
That's just how she is.

17:52.876 --> 17:55.710
All right then, let's get on with it.

17:59.876 --> 18:01.418
A cap will suffice.

18:03.418 --> 18:06.043
And, please, no corset.

18:08.460 --> 18:11.626
You see, it's just that I thought...

18:11.835 --> 18:14.668
That is, my mother thought...

18:16.251 --> 18:21.210
She sent the dress,
and she bought me the wig, from Paris!

18:21.460 --> 18:23.668
I'm certain she meant well.

18:23.876 --> 18:25.668
And it is very pretty.

18:26.418 --> 18:30.126
But here, for our purposes,
it seems rather a hindrance.

18:35.585 --> 18:37.501
Where are the magnets?

18:37.710 --> 18:42.001
I've learned they are not necessary
to set the fluid in motion.

18:42.751 --> 18:47.418
Of all nature's bodies, man himself
has the greatest effect on man.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.418
Man to a man is a wolf.

18:49.626 --> 18:51.293
<i>Homo homini lupus.</i>

18:52.710 --> 18:54.543
But I am no wolf.

18:55.668 --> 18:59.835
That was inappropriate. Pardon.
I don't know what got into me.

19:00.751 --> 19:05.376
Oh, I think it quite appropriate.
I rather meant the positive effects.

19:05.585 --> 19:07.293
<i>Mais naturellement.</i>

19:08.918 --> 19:14.293
I am greatly indebted to the Empress.
Not everyone receives such a pension.

19:14.501 --> 19:18.043
I must prove myself worthy,
and strive to achieve more.

19:20.876 --> 19:23.418
- Keep talking.
- About what?

19:23.626 --> 19:25.835
Anything. It makes no matter.

19:26.043 --> 19:29.126
Anything that comes to mind,
or what you feel.

19:30.085 --> 19:32.960
I don't know.
Everything seems unsuitable.

19:33.168 --> 19:35.585
- Or...
- Everything is suitable.

19:37.210 --> 19:40.501
<i>Hourglass, move so fast
How I hope the sand will not last</i>

19:40.710 --> 19:43.460
<i>Watch the sand trickle down
Turn the hourglass around</i>

19:43.668 --> 19:45.710
<i>Hourglass, move so fast</i>

19:51.126 --> 19:53.376
I'm quite good at the piano already.

19:53.585 --> 19:56.835
And I have a good chance
of becoming better.

19:57.001 --> 19:59.710
But, otherwise, there is a lot amiss.

20:00.668 --> 20:03.501
I forget everything when playing piano.

20:03.710 --> 20:05.376
My mouth and...

20:05.585 --> 20:08.376
I rock back and forth.
Have you noticed?

20:10.210 --> 20:13.376
When sitting at the piano
I feel like a general.

20:15.501 --> 20:19.751
Otherwise, I am unable to do much.
I don't know where things are.

20:20.543 --> 20:23.418
At the piano I know
where everything I need is.

20:23.626 --> 20:26.210
There is an order there that...

20:27.585 --> 20:30.751
That can overwhelm me.
In the good sense, that is.

20:30.960 --> 20:34.168
From girlfriends I know
seeing is even lovelier.

20:34.376 --> 20:37.543
If you cannot see, you are not seen.

20:37.751 --> 20:40.543
And if you are not seen,
you are not heard.

20:40.751 --> 20:42.335
You do not live.

21:47.876 --> 21:49.751
She's sitting in my seat.

21:49.918 --> 21:53.293
- Pardon me.
- Oh no! She shouldn't trouble herself.

21:54.043 --> 21:57.501
I don't mind her sitting in my seat.

21:57.710 --> 22:02.168
I just wanted to mention it,
for I did not sleep a wink all night.

22:03.168 --> 22:04.960
I was lonely.

22:06.126 --> 22:09.251
And loneliness is a door for the devil.

22:10.085 --> 22:12.210
But she doesn't understand
what that means.

22:12.918 --> 22:16.085
She cannot even see,
if I have heard correctly.

22:16.293 --> 22:17.960
I prefer to sit over there.

22:19.001 --> 22:23.418
One never knows what the patients
from outside carry in here with them.

25:46.251 --> 25:47.918
Who's there?

26:07.960 --> 26:09.751
Please forgive me.

26:12.585 --> 26:14.001
Agnes.

26:14.210 --> 26:16.001
What is this?
What do you have on?

26:16.210 --> 26:19.501
- Are you wearing my things?
- I was just trying it on.

26:19.710 --> 26:22.001
I was just about to take it off.

26:22.210 --> 26:25.085
- Please don't tell anyone.
- Faster!

26:27.168 --> 26:29.585
The madam already has it in for me.

26:29.793 --> 26:34.210
You should've thought of that earlier.
You wretched person, you.

26:37.126 --> 26:39.043
Why are you stopping?

26:39.835 --> 26:43.876
- Have you already taken it off?
- Something got tangled.

27:07.043 --> 27:09.876
"'Ah, Biondetta,' said I,

27:10.085 --> 27:12.251
'were you not a fantastical being,

27:12.501 --> 27:15.418
were you not an ugly dromedary!'

27:15.626 --> 27:17.960
But what have I been fooled into?

27:18.168 --> 27:22.210
Fear is gone
and a more perilous passion remained.

27:22.460 --> 27:24.835
What pleasure can I expect of that?

27:25.043 --> 27:27.376
Will it not always suit its origins?

27:27.876 --> 27:32.168
The fire in her soft, tender eyes
is deathly poison.

27:32.418 --> 27:33.876
Her beautiful mouth..."

27:39.460 --> 27:41.668
- Is it finished?
- <i>Pardon, mademoiselles.</i>

27:41.835 --> 27:43.626
I was distracted.

27:43.835 --> 27:46.626
Saint Margaret slayed a demon as well.

27:46.835 --> 27:50.460
She led it around
on a rose-coloured ribbon, like a lamb.

27:50.668 --> 27:52.085
Oh?

27:54.543 --> 27:56.085
You're blind.

27:56.293 --> 27:57.793
I'm also blind.

27:57.960 --> 27:59.960
The orphanage attested to that.

28:00.918 --> 28:02.543
Look, I'll show you something.

28:03.668 --> 28:05.251
Our mother, Mary, Mother of God,

28:05.501 --> 28:07.668
full of grace,
who helps and protects us.

28:07.835 --> 28:11.376
Us in particular,
because we are named in her honour.

28:11.585 --> 28:13.376
This is an image of her.

28:18.876 --> 28:20.335
Uh-huh.

28:20.543 --> 28:22.460
I carry it with me always.

28:23.835 --> 28:27.001
Nice,
but neither of us can see it, right?

28:28.793 --> 28:30.793
Would you give it back to me?

28:32.710 --> 28:35.251
I know it is the Holy Virgin,

28:36.043 --> 28:40.335
because I embroidered the edge
and it has wonderful red roses on it.

28:41.043 --> 28:42.501
They symbolize love,

28:42.710 --> 28:45.460
the love of Mary, Mother of God,
for the Christ Child.

28:45.668 --> 28:48.251
Because the Christ Child is on it too.

28:48.501 --> 28:51.251
And on the sides,
above and in the background,

28:51.501 --> 28:55.793
angels fly around everywhere
with their beautiful golden wings.

29:01.418 --> 29:03.585
It feels like a needle to the eye.

29:03.793 --> 29:07.001
- It hurts!
- Remove your hands from your eyes.

29:10.585 --> 29:12.418
Now open your eyes.

29:12.626 --> 29:14.210
Be brave.

29:18.501 --> 29:21.876
It feels like a wild animal
that is going after my eyes.

29:24.126 --> 29:28.501
Then I'm here to tame it for you.
Your own personal tamer of light.

29:29.293 --> 29:31.543
At your service, Miss.

29:33.418 --> 29:36.043
There's something.
I don't know what.

29:36.918 --> 29:38.460
But...

29:38.668 --> 29:40.418
it is still there.

29:41.210 --> 29:43.168
With your eyes closed?

29:46.293 --> 29:49.210
- Yes, it's still there.
- Can you describe it?

29:49.835 --> 29:51.793
No, but there is something.

30:05.001 --> 30:07.460
It is very unpleasant.

30:07.668 --> 30:10.001
That is the colour white.

30:10.210 --> 30:12.043
It hurts!

30:12.251 --> 30:14.876
It is no reason to worry, Miss Paradis.

30:15.085 --> 30:17.751
These sensations
have an external cause.

30:17.918 --> 30:20.418
You are beginning to perceive light.

30:23.960 --> 30:26.210
The madam sewed this lovely piece.

30:27.043 --> 30:28.751
Just for you.

30:29.626 --> 30:32.126
And I embroidered that right there.

30:33.210 --> 30:34.710
A bird.

30:35.960 --> 30:38.335
Is that all right or is it too tight?

30:40.710 --> 30:42.126
Does it hurt you to see?

30:42.376 --> 30:43.960
No, not at all.

30:45.001 --> 30:46.251
Because you can.

30:46.501 --> 30:48.668
Nearly everyone can.

30:49.460 --> 30:51.210
You can do so much.

30:51.460 --> 30:53.460
I can't do anything special.

30:54.793 --> 30:57.460
- I can't even read.
- Neither can I.

30:58.668 --> 31:01.668
But sometimes someone reads to me.

31:01.835 --> 31:03.418
Really?

31:03.626 --> 31:05.335
Who is that?

31:11.001 --> 31:13.168
- And is it nice?
- What?

31:14.085 --> 31:15.585
Seeing.

31:16.293 --> 31:17.793
Yes.

31:18.001 --> 31:19.793
I mean, I'd say so.

31:20.710 --> 31:22.626
How can I put it?

31:23.543 --> 31:24.501
Yes.

31:24.710 --> 31:27.043
It depends a bit on what you see.

31:30.126 --> 31:32.210
I can smell you.

31:32.460 --> 31:34.418
And do I smell good?

31:35.418 --> 31:37.085
I think so.

31:37.293 --> 31:39.501
Thanks and praise to God for that.

31:40.710 --> 31:43.376
I'm going now.
They'll be calling for me.

31:43.585 --> 31:47.626
- But if you need anything more...
- No. Everything's fine.

32:01.876 --> 32:06.626
<i>Loislboy, don't annoy,
you can't talk, you can't walk.</i>

32:06.835 --> 32:09.168
<i>Always having fun, nothing to be done!</i>

32:09.376 --> 32:11.793
<i>Loislboy, go bye-bye...</i>

36:12.835 --> 36:14.460
Eyes open.

36:25.251 --> 36:27.335
That's how a person looks?

37:03.168 --> 37:04.876
Do you see us?

37:07.501 --> 37:09.085
Yes.

37:11.626 --> 37:12.626
My child!

37:12.835 --> 37:16.418
- Oh my! She is overwhelmed by emotion.
- To the sofa.

37:17.543 --> 37:19.876
Well, it is understandable.

37:20.668 --> 37:22.251
The excitement.

37:28.710 --> 37:31.335
<i>Monsieur le docteur, I am moved.</i>

37:32.710 --> 37:37.043
An emotion
that I can hardly express in words

37:37.251 --> 37:39.918
overcomes me in the face of this...

37:40.126 --> 37:42.043
yes, of this miracle.

37:42.251 --> 37:47.626
- When the Empress learns of this...
- Her sight is still poor, Sir.

37:47.835 --> 37:50.793
- But a miracle it is not.
- Nonetheless.

37:51.001 --> 37:52.585
<i>Quel triomphe!</i>

37:55.876 --> 37:57.126
Now those are eyes!

37:58.376 --> 38:01.876
Like proud chestnuts
in their spiny cradle.

38:02.085 --> 38:03.668
No.

38:03.835 --> 38:06.585
Like sunken ships in the rain.

38:06.793 --> 38:10.085
Now you no longer need
to attack things forwardly.

38:10.293 --> 38:13.126
We must make this public, right?

38:13.376 --> 38:15.501
- Put it in the paper.
- <i>Vraiment.</i>

38:15.710 --> 38:19.501
- The world must share in this!
- She must get accustomed to it.

38:28.960 --> 38:30.668
A globe.

38:32.376 --> 38:33.835
It is round.

38:34.043 --> 38:36.043
And...

38:36.251 --> 38:38.001
this is pointed.

38:39.918 --> 38:43.251
I know how pointiness feels,
but not how it looks.

38:44.751 --> 38:46.793
I cannot put it together.

38:47.585 --> 38:49.335
And what is on top?

38:55.876 --> 38:59.835
- A point.
- Very good, Therese. Bravo.

39:00.918 --> 39:04.335
My girlfriend Anna says
eyes were made to recognize truth.

39:05.626 --> 39:08.460
Then I must disappoint you,
Miss Paradis.

39:08.668 --> 39:11.918
Eyes come no closer to the truth
than the other senses.

39:12.126 --> 39:15.626
- It is all an apparition.
- Perhaps it's like with music.

39:16.793 --> 39:20.085
Despite not even being at the piano,
I hear it so beautifully.

39:20.293 --> 39:23.126
As if I were playing the organ
at St Charles.

39:23.335 --> 39:25.585
But your playing is not an apparition.

39:26.501 --> 39:28.668
I, in any case, hear it very well.

40:39.418 --> 40:40.835
Got you!

41:10.626 --> 41:11.585
I'll get you!

41:14.751 --> 41:15.751
Come here!

42:02.835 --> 42:04.210
Agi!

42:25.168 --> 42:28.001
- Pardon me.
- No need, no need.

42:28.210 --> 42:30.751
Stay here, feel entirely at ease.

42:30.960 --> 42:32.543
Please, play on.

42:44.751 --> 42:48.835
This is old man Bach.
Perhaps a bit outmoded, but I like it.

42:49.043 --> 42:52.835
Well, well. The young lady
favours such serious things.

42:56.251 --> 42:58.543
- It has depth, I think.
- Excellent.

42:58.751 --> 43:02.085
As if I've stepped
into the most glorious of concerts.

43:03.085 --> 43:05.835
Thank you,
but that really is too much praise.

43:06.043 --> 43:10.376
It should be faster, and I used to
be better at crossing my hands.

43:10.585 --> 43:14.043
- Don't you notice that?
- <i>Au contraire, mademoiselle.</i>

43:14.251 --> 43:16.085
Your playing is highly virtuosic.

43:45.835 --> 43:48.751
You are the talk of the entire city,
<i>mon amour.</i>

43:48.918 --> 43:51.918
Marquise von Andrassy asked about it
at Madame Bondi's.

43:52.126 --> 43:55.001
And Mrs Harrach
is all but beside herself.

43:55.210 --> 43:57.793
She didn't stop congratulating me.

43:58.001 --> 44:01.335
She said she'll consult you
about her vapours.

44:02.501 --> 44:04.460
Your success has now arrived.

44:05.126 --> 44:06.835
That's nonsense.

44:07.043 --> 44:09.751
Firstly, Störck must take note of it,

44:09.918 --> 44:13.626
then the Academy
and the Empress, above all else.

44:13.835 --> 44:17.585
But that will come.
Now you are on everyone's lips.

44:17.793 --> 44:19.585
And what good does that do me?

44:20.376 --> 44:22.793
The blathering about it in your salons.

44:22.960 --> 44:25.960
I want my method at the university.

44:26.501 --> 44:28.501
Not in Harrach's antechamber.

44:28.710 --> 44:31.418
Yes, you are right, Franz.

44:31.626 --> 44:34.543
But how they admire you
pleases me all the same.

45:08.043 --> 45:11.001
- What is she doing there?
- She's reaching somewhere.

45:11.210 --> 45:12.876
Yes, but where?

45:13.085 --> 45:14.960
Into the air.

45:15.168 --> 45:18.501
Perhaps she sees so well now
that she can see air.

45:18.710 --> 45:20.126
<i>Parbleu!</i>

45:32.835 --> 45:34.960
They are far away, those trees.

45:35.835 --> 45:38.418
Beyond the garden, beyond the path.

45:57.585 --> 46:01.918
I can't understand how they stay up
without falling over in the wind.

46:03.835 --> 46:06.376
Such a long trunk and so many branches.

46:07.210 --> 46:11.335
I've tried to find two that match,
but they are all different.

46:11.543 --> 46:13.626
Not a single pair to be found.

46:15.210 --> 46:16.751
But right she is.

46:22.626 --> 46:24.418
That is very beautiful.

46:26.043 --> 46:28.876
Therese, that is dung.
It is not beautiful!

46:47.585 --> 46:50.460
I hope you'll forgive the brazenness

46:50.668 --> 46:53.793
with which I am calling attention
to myself, Miss.

46:53.960 --> 46:56.126
I am Dr Barth.

46:56.376 --> 46:58.418
I treated you previously.

46:58.626 --> 47:03.501
Not with the same resounding success,
as I must admit.

47:03.710 --> 47:05.460
I recognized your voice.

47:05.668 --> 47:10.710
I do hope that my appearance
has not too painfully disappointed you.

47:11.543 --> 47:13.460
Not at all, esteemed doctor.

47:13.668 --> 47:17.793
Although, upon hearing of your recovery
and today's gathering,

47:18.001 --> 47:19.543
I came in such a haste

47:19.751 --> 47:23.418
that I was not even able
to don my tricorne.

47:23.626 --> 47:28.001
For which
I wish to most humbly apologize.

47:30.835 --> 47:31.835
Oh dear!

47:32.043 --> 47:35.001
- That is outrageous!
- Dr Barth, please!

47:37.251 --> 47:38.960
Oh, I know that!

47:39.501 --> 47:41.960
That is the colour... That is...

47:44.876 --> 47:46.793
- Yellow.
- That is yellow.

47:50.376 --> 47:54.460
- Have you hurt yourself?
- No, it is nothing! <i>Pas grave.</i>

47:54.960 --> 47:58.793
I'd like my blindfold, please.
The light is still too strong.

48:05.960 --> 48:08.001
We'll go back inside the house.

48:11.251 --> 48:14.210
The child is running into things
more than she did before.

48:17.751 --> 48:20.876
"Why so many young ladies
do not find husbands

48:21.085 --> 48:23.460
along with a remedy to that problem.

48:23.668 --> 48:26.710
In this matter,
much depends on circumstances

48:26.876 --> 48:30.335
over which
these poor girls have no control,

48:30.543 --> 48:34.126
and for which
all suggestions are futile.

48:34.376 --> 48:36.085
Is it any fault of hers

48:36.293 --> 48:39.876
if nature has treated
a young lady with such neglect

48:40.085 --> 48:44.335
or if an accident has robbed her
of her natural charms to such extent

48:44.543 --> 48:49.335
that no gentleman can be expected
to choose her for his wife?"

48:49.543 --> 48:51.668
But you're able to see again now.

48:52.710 --> 48:57.501
Now you can have a look around as well.
So many people are visiting as it is.

48:57.710 --> 48:59.710
Is there no one you fancy?

48:59.876 --> 49:01.668
I don't think I see that well yet.

49:03.210 --> 49:07.168
Miss Aichelburg is now engaged
to Mr Kaunitz-Rittberg.

49:07.335 --> 49:09.835
<i>- Mais non!
- On dit.</i>

49:10.668 --> 49:14.001
- I am green with envy.
- Is he very handsome?

49:14.210 --> 49:15.793
Immensely.

49:15.960 --> 49:18.751
He is the finest gallant in the city.

49:18.918 --> 49:21.751
He was here today.
Didn't you see him?

49:22.835 --> 49:25.876
He was wearing
a silver frock, with gold!

49:28.085 --> 49:29.793
Don't you look at all?

49:30.793 --> 49:32.626
He's rich as well.

49:34.585 --> 49:37.376
Whom do you think beautiful, Therese?

49:37.585 --> 49:39.460
Me?

49:43.376 --> 49:45.626
I think Agnes is pretty.

49:46.835 --> 49:49.501
- But I don't know much of such things.
- Who is that?

49:50.043 --> 49:52.210
- My chambermaid.
- A servant?

49:53.751 --> 49:55.918
A servant with her block feet?

49:56.376 --> 49:58.835
I'm sure she walks like a duck.

50:00.960 --> 50:02.793
With arms like this!

50:12.501 --> 50:15.793
- She seems pretty to me.
- You really have no clue.

50:16.001 --> 50:18.793
Look, it says here
what beauty is in a woman.

50:21.710 --> 50:23.960
"Not fat and not skinny,

50:24.168 --> 50:26.793
soft chestnut brown hair
with dainty curls,

50:27.876 --> 50:31.835
small, rosy ears that do not
protrude too far from the head,

50:32.043 --> 50:34.335
delicate skin with blue veins

50:34.543 --> 50:36.918
a smooth and fair brow,

50:37.126 --> 50:38.876
a comely nose,

50:39.085 --> 50:42.835
beautiful red lips,
small white pearl-like teeth,

50:43.043 --> 50:45.085
an ivory-white neck

50:45.293 --> 50:48.835
an alabaster bosom,
fleecy, snow-white hands..."

52:17.585 --> 52:19.001
Agi!

52:19.751 --> 52:21.168
Agi!

52:21.960 --> 52:23.460
Agnes!

52:25.751 --> 52:28.085
Agnes will be here directly, Miss.

52:33.501 --> 52:36.585
It's nothing. It's nothing at all.

52:36.793 --> 52:38.418
It will stop.

52:43.835 --> 52:46.085
It's the only thing I can do.

52:47.085 --> 52:49.668
- Could do.
- You can still do it.

52:49.876 --> 52:51.793
You understand nothing of it!

52:56.585 --> 52:58.210
I had a dream.

53:00.001 --> 53:02.585
Now I sometimes see
in my dreams as well.

53:03.918 --> 53:05.793
I see a large tree.

53:06.751 --> 53:10.626
- And you were there too.
- That surely means something.

53:10.835 --> 53:13.501
Everything one dreams
means something.

53:14.085 --> 53:15.960
And what does it mean?

53:16.710 --> 53:18.335
I don't know.

53:21.085 --> 53:23.418
Some people have faces, too.

53:23.626 --> 53:25.168
Very blurred.

53:27.543 --> 53:29.960
It used to be only voices or hands.

53:31.543 --> 53:33.835
And do I have a face?

53:36.501 --> 53:38.960
Sometimes. Yes.

53:48.710 --> 53:50.335
What is this?

53:51.460 --> 53:53.251
Don't reach for it!

54:02.001 --> 54:03.793
I don't know.

54:04.543 --> 54:06.126
Look very closely.

54:06.376 --> 54:08.126
We've had it before.

54:10.085 --> 54:12.876
- The nautilus shell?
- Bravo, Miss!

54:19.460 --> 54:21.418
I don't know.

54:21.626 --> 54:23.043
I should know.

54:23.251 --> 54:24.918
It's a...

54:25.751 --> 54:28.876
May I ask you
to concentrate a bit more.

54:30.043 --> 54:32.043
You already know the parasol.

54:32.251 --> 54:34.710
But lying like this
it looks so different.

54:34.876 --> 54:38.876
And from here it looks different still,
yet it's still a parasol.

54:39.085 --> 54:43.793
Yes, naturally. It depends on
how you see it, on your viewpoint.

54:43.960 --> 54:47.001
So the object changes
depending on how I look at it?

54:47.210 --> 54:50.168
No, the object itself does not change.

55:00.960 --> 55:03.001
How droll that she can do that.

55:03.210 --> 55:04.793
Splendid.

55:10.460 --> 55:15.418
The different noses surprised her most.
It still makes her laugh.

55:16.043 --> 55:18.043
How do they seem to you, Resi?

55:18.251 --> 55:22.918
As if they were threatening me.
And they don't suit the faces at all.

55:23.668 --> 55:27.751
Therese, what do you think
of hats à la Matignon?

55:28.751 --> 55:31.835
I think they are
disproportionate to the face.

55:32.918 --> 55:37.876
And she said the pond in the park
reminded her of a large bowl of soup.

55:38.876 --> 55:42.251
Like a girl
from the Canadian forests of America.

55:42.501 --> 55:44.126
Totally unspoiled.

55:52.918 --> 55:57.418
- Not much left over.
- Hey! Hands off, that's for Hansl.

55:58.043 --> 55:59.418
Leave it!

55:59.626 --> 56:03.793
I'll stay clear of the meat anyway.
Not with my teeth.

56:03.960 --> 56:06.210
You could have false teeth made.

56:07.001 --> 56:08.418
What?

56:09.126 --> 56:10.085
Yes.

56:10.293 --> 56:13.251
They exist.
Someone told me so.

56:13.501 --> 56:15.835
False teeth?
How can that work?

56:16.043 --> 56:18.710
- Do they grow?
- No.

56:18.918 --> 56:21.210
From... from wood.

56:21.460 --> 56:24.376
- Or something.
- See, Miazl, you could get back in it.

56:24.585 --> 56:26.251
I'm happy to have only one.

56:26.793 --> 56:28.043
How I cried!

56:28.251 --> 56:30.793
They'd be false, they wouldn't hurt.

56:31.543 --> 56:34.543
- I'm glad all the same.
- No worries, no one will give you any.

56:35.043 --> 56:39.751
Maybe the doctor will grow you some,
now that he can heal the blind.

56:39.918 --> 56:43.376
- He should make Loisl better.
- He can't do that.

56:43.585 --> 56:46.085
He looked him over already.

56:46.293 --> 56:48.085
He's fine the way he is.

56:48.293 --> 56:51.626
Right, dear? My Loislboy.

57:16.460 --> 57:18.168
It won't come out anymore.

57:23.501 --> 57:25.126
Blood.

57:25.751 --> 57:27.960
Give it here. We'll see about that.

57:32.668 --> 57:35.960
Miazl, what does it mean
if you dream of a tree?

57:36.168 --> 57:39.293
- What else was in the dream?
- I don't know.

57:39.501 --> 57:43.335
- It wasn't my dream.
- Whose was it then?

57:43.543 --> 57:45.210
A tree means

57:45.793 --> 57:48.626
growth, getting bigger.

57:48.835 --> 57:51.043
Agnes, I need you in the kitchen.

57:51.251 --> 57:54.876
- Go away!
- Hedi, stop pestering him!

57:55.085 --> 57:57.626
That is very bad.
Can't he do anything?

57:57.835 --> 58:02.335
The court physician is coming
with a whole delegation of 14 people.

58:02.543 --> 58:05.960
Why so many at once?
Do they help each other look?

58:06.168 --> 58:11.085
- No, they help each other <i>think.</i>
- Maybe they'd be scared otherwise.

58:11.293 --> 58:15.126
Big wigs with nothing underneath!

58:21.168 --> 58:23.585
That's what you get, you fool!

58:27.501 --> 58:28.876
To the right.

58:29.085 --> 58:31.376
To the left.
Don't move your head!

58:32.501 --> 58:33.585
To the right.

58:34.210 --> 58:35.960
To the left. Not the head!

58:36.168 --> 58:38.126
I can't do it anymore.

58:39.626 --> 58:40.585
Be brave.

58:41.460 --> 58:44.543
The muscle exercises
speed up the healing process.

58:46.126 --> 58:49.918
- Störck is coming to look at you.
- Dr von Störck?

58:50.126 --> 58:51.793
He is important.

58:52.001 --> 58:53.376
For whom?

58:53.585 --> 58:55.043
He sheared my head.

58:55.251 --> 58:57.501
I was all bristly, like a pig!

58:59.835 --> 59:03.918
Dane's blood and valerian root,
then quicksilver and sulphur.

59:04.793 --> 59:08.960
"A snow-white powder," he said,
"as pure as a celestial angel."

59:09.168 --> 59:11.501
I drank it dissolved in water.

59:13.501 --> 59:16.793
Then came the purulent boils
and the ringing in my ears.

59:17.835 --> 59:21.210
My punishment
for playing the organ, I thought.

59:21.460 --> 59:24.918
The organ does not befit
a young lady, Father says.

59:27.668 --> 59:28.960
Shall we continue?

59:29.918 --> 59:32.376
You don't want
to let down your Dr von Störck.

59:44.168 --> 59:45.751
The parasol.

59:51.960 --> 59:53.460
The hourglass.

01:00:01.668 --> 01:00:03.210
The globe.

01:00:09.251 --> 01:00:10.918
The nautilus shell.

01:00:15.918 --> 01:00:17.501
The magnifying glass.

01:00:22.210 --> 01:00:23.168
The coral.

01:00:37.918 --> 01:00:40.418
Mademoiselle Paradis, if I may?

01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:43.126
Do you know this gentleman?

01:00:46.293 --> 01:00:50.043
No, I do not believe
I've had the honour of meeting you.

01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:54.793
Oh! Yet I remember our last meeting
so very vividly indeed.

01:00:56.418 --> 01:00:57.918
Dr Barth!

01:00:58.751 --> 01:01:00.793
Please do forgive me.

01:01:01.001 --> 01:01:04.001
You know,
faces are still difficult for me.

01:01:05.418 --> 01:01:11.751
Then could you perhaps be so friendly
as to answer a little question for me?

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:14.210
What is this?

01:01:16.335 --> 01:01:18.126
That is...

01:01:18.335 --> 01:01:20.168
That is a...

01:01:20.335 --> 01:01:22.710
I don't know what that is,
but I see it!

01:01:23.918 --> 01:01:25.501
So what is it then?

01:01:33.585 --> 01:01:34.876
I... I don't know.

01:01:36.418 --> 01:01:41.168
I must point out that Miss Paradis
only regained her sight very recently

01:01:41.335 --> 01:01:43.626
and cannot know everything.

01:01:43.876 --> 01:01:45.335
But please, Mr Mesmer.

01:01:45.543 --> 01:01:50.585
Surely she will have encountered
a pocket watch in her lifetime!

01:01:52.668 --> 01:01:56.376
Dr Barth, do forgive me,
but I am quite astounded

01:01:56.585 --> 01:02:00.501
that a man of your craft
can commit such an error.

01:02:00.751 --> 01:02:04.960
You know as well as I that someone
who went blind at a very tender age

01:02:05.168 --> 01:02:07.960
must <i>learn</i> how to see,
like a newborn,

01:02:08.168 --> 01:02:10.168
must get to know the visible world.

01:02:12.293 --> 01:02:16.126
- Let us proceed to colours.
- Mademoiselle Paradis!

01:02:16.293 --> 01:02:18.168
What colour is my frock?

01:02:20.168 --> 01:02:21.126
Yellow.

01:02:27.001 --> 01:02:30.085
Esteemed doctor,
may I ask a question as well?

01:02:30.835 --> 01:02:32.251
Please.

01:02:35.668 --> 01:02:39.001
It would seem this fluid
that you have discovered

01:02:39.210 --> 01:02:42.668
can be neither seen,
nor heard nor smelled.

01:02:43.835 --> 01:02:45.501
Can it be weighed or measured?

01:02:45.751 --> 01:02:46.918
No.

01:02:47.126 --> 01:02:50.376
Can it be seen under a microscope?

01:02:50.585 --> 01:02:51.751
No.

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:55.710
- But...
- Then I must question its existence.

01:03:04.918 --> 01:03:06.501
You can neither see nor smell it,

01:03:08.001 --> 01:03:11.168
but it has helped me regain
my ability to see and smell.

01:03:11.376 --> 01:03:13.293
That is enough for me.

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:18.043
And you can feel it.

01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:24.168
Unfortunately, there is no way for me
to confirm the certainty of that truth.

01:03:24.335 --> 01:03:28.418
It seems it will have to remain
incomprehensible to me.

01:03:29.876 --> 01:03:33.001
But surely there is a soul,
is there not?

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:35.543
Of course, Miss.
Unquestionably.

01:03:36.418 --> 01:03:38.335
And can you see it?

01:03:43.543 --> 01:03:47.001
I must express
my utter admiration, Doctor.

01:03:47.501 --> 01:03:51.293
I must admit that, until now,
I numbered among the sceptics.

01:03:51.501 --> 01:03:53.835
But I now regret having waited so long

01:03:54.043 --> 01:03:57.751
to aid such an important invention
by granting my approval.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:00.543
I must say I no longer have any doubt.

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:04.251
I cannot adequately express to you

01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:08.168
how much that honours and pleases me,
Mr von Störck.

01:04:08.376 --> 01:04:11.085
I must admit to you, Mesmer,

01:04:11.251 --> 01:04:16.335
that there must indeed be something
for which our eyes are still too weak,

01:04:16.543 --> 01:04:19.001
something that will require

01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:22.960
more powerful and different kinds
of microscopes.

01:04:23.168 --> 01:04:26.835
May I be so bold
as to probe you further, Doctor?

01:04:27.376 --> 01:04:31.460
Is it possible Her Majesty might show
an interest in this case?

01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:34.501
We shall see, Mesmer.

01:04:34.751 --> 01:04:36.918
From what I have seen today,

01:04:37.126 --> 01:04:39.918
I certainly
do not think that impossible.

01:05:00.418 --> 01:05:02.585
I didn't recognize Dr Barth.

01:05:03.376 --> 01:05:05.168
Never mind.

01:05:05.335 --> 01:05:07.460
Let him think what he wants.

01:05:07.668 --> 01:05:11.460
And he certainly does not have a face
one wishes to remember.

01:06:28.168 --> 01:06:31.418
Therese! You will now
play something for our guests.

01:06:31.626 --> 01:06:34.585
Kirnberger, preferably,
to show off your talent.

01:06:34.835 --> 01:06:38.126
No, Father.
I'm a bit tired, and Kirnberger...

01:06:38.293 --> 01:06:40.876
I... Please, I'd rather not.

01:06:41.085 --> 01:06:44.626
Oh, come,
you can play it blindfolded.

01:06:45.626 --> 01:06:48.918
Or are you worried
we'll think less of you?

01:06:49.126 --> 01:06:53.876
She's worried we'll think less of her.
We shall see if you manage that.

01:07:08.501 --> 01:07:10.793
It's not quite on point.

01:07:11.001 --> 01:07:12.043
Unbelievable.

01:07:50.418 --> 01:07:53.043
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:07:53.210 --> 01:07:57.085
Ladies and gentlemen,
our artist is weary.

01:07:57.251 --> 01:08:01.210
She'll want to recover a bit
from the great exertions.

01:08:02.168 --> 01:08:04.210
But she did recognize a lot.

01:08:04.418 --> 01:08:05.543
The desire to see,

01:08:05.793 --> 01:08:08.876
and her desire
to please her dear Dr Mesmer

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:10.501
is seemingly so great

01:08:10.751 --> 01:08:15.126
that her mind performs a violent feat,
grasping everything around her.

01:08:15.293 --> 01:08:19.167
That is also why it is so hard
to expose Mesmer's deception.

01:08:19.376 --> 01:08:21.710
Neural suggestion.

01:08:22.876 --> 01:08:26.251
The power of imagination
can elicit emotions,

01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:30.417
and, thus, can also produce changes
in the human body.

01:08:30.626 --> 01:08:34.792
- Well, then she does see.
- She believes she can see.

01:08:35.001 --> 01:08:40.792
Oh well, one has better things to do
than be deceived, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

01:08:41.001 --> 01:08:42.710
I take my leave.

01:08:47.126 --> 01:08:50.960
That was pathetic.
How shameful! An utter disgrace!

01:08:51.542 --> 01:08:56.001
I see my fingers moving over the keys
and then I get stuck somehow.

01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:57.835
Then don't look!

01:08:58.042 --> 01:09:02.626
Mozart plays with a concealed keyboard.
And it never stopped you before.

01:09:02.876 --> 01:09:04.167
Yes, Papa.

01:09:04.335 --> 01:09:08.085
You must be prepared
to make a few sacrifices for your art.

01:09:08.251 --> 01:09:11.876
Despite the manifold distractions
in this house.

01:09:14.167 --> 01:09:16.292
She played like a dilettante!

01:09:16.501 --> 01:09:20.042
What do you care?
She is not your daughter, as I stress.

01:09:20.210 --> 01:09:24.585
If this is great success,
then she'd be better off blind again.

01:09:24.835 --> 01:09:27.460
The nervous system
needs time to adjust.

01:09:27.667 --> 01:09:31.876
But who will give me a guarantee
that it will improve?

01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:35.917
In her case, if she can do nothing,
she amounts to nothing.

01:09:36.126 --> 01:09:39.501
What is the point of that look?
You know that's true.

01:09:40.126 --> 01:09:43.710
I wouldn't be at all surprised
if she loses her pension.

01:09:43.917 --> 01:09:45.542
Why should she have it?

01:09:45.792 --> 01:09:48.251
One must practice and be patient.

01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:50.167
And she stays who she is.

01:09:50.542 --> 01:09:53.751
And who do you think she is
without her talent?

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:57.543
A God-given talent!
You should be grateful for that.

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.876
God gave me my eyes, too.

01:10:02.085 --> 01:10:06.085
Yes, but they are worthless.
No one gives a hoot about your eyes.

01:10:06.251 --> 01:10:09.418
I'm sure one or two who care
can be found.

01:10:10.335 --> 01:10:13.418
Mr Mesmer, with all due respect,

01:10:13.626 --> 01:10:16.001
what my daughter does and does not do,

01:10:16.210 --> 01:10:19.793
and who should care about her eyes,

01:10:20.001 --> 01:10:21.876
is still determined by me.

01:10:23.293 --> 01:10:26.876
And for now,
I forbid any further visits

01:10:27.085 --> 01:10:29.168
and viewings.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:31.251
I take my leave.

01:10:32.835 --> 01:10:34.710
Mr von Paradis!

01:10:35.085 --> 01:10:36.835
I beg your pardon,

01:10:37.335 --> 01:10:40.751
but I think I am still the one
in charge of determining

01:10:41.418 --> 01:10:43.751
who enters my house and who doesn't.

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:45.710
Who enters <i>your</i> house?

01:10:45.918 --> 01:10:48.085
We'll see about that.

01:10:55.626 --> 01:10:57.168
A kid with two heads.

01:10:57.376 --> 01:11:00.960
Two Indians, but they were really
from Neulerchenfeld.

01:11:05.835 --> 01:11:08.460
Hey, you idiot,
what are you doing there?

01:11:10.835 --> 01:11:11.835
Loisl!

01:11:13.835 --> 01:11:14.918
Loisl!

01:11:39.543 --> 01:11:40.918
Let's wash him.

01:11:55.335 --> 01:11:58.501
I most humbly thank you, Madam,
for all the trouble.

01:11:58.710 --> 01:12:01.376
And the doctor, for all that he did.

01:12:01.585 --> 01:12:05.460
It is as it is.
God gives and God takes.

01:12:05.668 --> 01:12:11.293
- The monstrosity is gone now.
- Everything humanly possible was done.

01:12:11.501 --> 01:12:13.668
With all the doctors that were here.

01:12:13.876 --> 01:12:18.918
Yes. Certainly.
I'd like to thank you for that, too.

01:12:19.126 --> 01:12:24.085
You know, I already thought to myself
that it wouldn't work, Madam.

01:12:24.293 --> 01:12:27.376
His little head was all...
All squashed.

01:12:30.418 --> 01:12:33.626
Look, Johanna,
perhaps it is a blessing.

01:12:34.418 --> 01:12:37.293
What would you have done
when he was older?

01:12:39.710 --> 01:12:42.460
Yes. You're right about that.

01:12:43.668 --> 01:12:47.001
It's over now,
and he's in a better place.

01:12:48.626 --> 01:12:50.710
Maybe it's better this way.

01:15:19.293 --> 01:15:20.876
What did you eat yesterday?

01:15:21.043 --> 01:15:24.876
- Leftovers, as always.
- Did you get something from elsewhere?

01:15:26.501 --> 01:15:29.918
She took something
from your medicine cabinet, Doctor.

01:15:30.126 --> 01:15:33.751
- Why on earth?
- Pregnant is what she is.

01:15:38.126 --> 01:15:40.501
She's missed two months, she says.

01:15:41.751 --> 01:15:43.335
How foolish, child!

01:15:43.585 --> 01:15:46.085
Just taking something!
What did she take?

01:15:48.335 --> 01:15:51.710
This, and this.
That's all I got out of her.

01:15:52.501 --> 01:15:56.126
Just these, or something else?
Speak, you poor wretch!

01:15:57.335 --> 01:16:00.585
A green powder, from the very front.

01:16:04.751 --> 01:16:07.210
Come along,
I'll give you something for her.

01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:09.460
And you be sensible now!

01:16:10.168 --> 01:16:13.918
We'll find some solution
for this whole... mishap.

01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:23.960
It should have been obvious
this was going to happen.

01:16:24.168 --> 01:16:26.626
Look at that impertinent face!

01:16:26.835 --> 01:16:31.126
Perhaps Johanna can take the child.
It'd be an amicable solution.

01:16:31.335 --> 01:16:33.835
So you have already made arrangements?

01:16:34.043 --> 01:16:36.168
What do you think Paradis will say?

01:16:36.376 --> 01:16:39.043
Think of our reputation.
Your reputation!

01:16:39.293 --> 01:16:40.710
Paradis!

01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:44.293
That bugbear
cares only about his pension.

01:16:44.501 --> 01:16:47.626
- Scoundrel, that's all he is.
- He can kiss your arse!

01:16:47.835 --> 01:16:53.293
Cher Franz, my friend, I have to agree
with your charming wife.

01:16:53.501 --> 01:16:55.876
The girl has punished herself
by being a whore,

01:16:56.085 --> 01:16:59.251
but harming her keepers
will simply not do.

01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:04.043
Bondi says that some people
have major doubts that Paradis can see,

01:17:04.293 --> 01:17:07.210
that people are saying
it is all just a hoax.

01:17:07.751 --> 01:17:10.168
She said that to me
in front of Harrach.

01:17:10.376 --> 01:17:14.126
And she sat there
with a smug smirk on her face.

01:17:15.251 --> 01:17:17.710
They acted as if you were a fraud!

01:17:17.918 --> 01:17:22.043
Störck is an honourable man
and an upstanding scientist.

01:17:23.001 --> 01:17:26.126
He'll pay no mind to such blather.
He saw it himself.

01:17:26.710 --> 01:17:28.376
The truth is worthless.

01:17:28.585 --> 01:17:34.543
And Barth is going around saying
her imagination is eliciting emotions.

01:17:35.501 --> 01:17:39.293
- And only to please you.
- Ludicrous!

01:17:41.251 --> 01:17:43.668
They're talking her blind again.

01:17:44.501 --> 01:17:49.210
They don't want you, I'm telling you.
They didn't want you from the start.

01:17:49.418 --> 01:17:52.585
They're just waiting for something
to show you up.

01:17:53.376 --> 01:17:55.210
I have Störck as an advocate.

01:17:55.418 --> 01:17:58.626
He will speak for me
if things come to a head.

01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:03.751
They said there are doubts about
the state of affairs in our house.

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:05.793
In my house.

01:18:06.001 --> 01:18:09.960
They said you're carrying on with her
and asked if I hadn't noticed.

01:18:11.210 --> 01:18:12.710
And you believe that?

01:18:14.543 --> 01:18:16.210
No, of course not.

01:18:23.251 --> 01:18:27.376
Johanna is to tell Agnes
she must leave here by month's end.

01:18:58.626 --> 01:19:02.418
I don't want to be someone
who can do nothing and is nothing.

01:19:03.418 --> 01:19:05.835
Someone whose life doesn't matter.

01:19:07.335 --> 01:19:09.876
God doesn't love us for what we can do.

01:19:11.876 --> 01:19:13.626
For what then?

01:20:14.835 --> 01:20:17.168
I need not give you an explanation.

01:20:18.335 --> 01:20:22.210
My husband and I still decide
what happens with our child.

01:20:22.418 --> 01:20:24.168
She's under your command.

01:20:24.376 --> 01:20:26.460
But if you end the cure now

01:20:26.626 --> 01:20:29.418
and her gout returns,
I vouch for nothing.

01:20:31.418 --> 01:20:35.418
If her pains return, and her attacks,
I will not lift a finger!

01:20:40.751 --> 01:20:42.585
I am not leaving.

01:20:43.501 --> 01:20:47.668
And you are in league with them.
With this rabble! You rotten brat!

01:20:49.876 --> 01:20:53.043
- I am not leaving!
- You'll do what you're told!

01:20:55.085 --> 01:20:59.626
Your father is fretting to death.
And I must pay for your misbehaviour!

01:21:00.501 --> 01:21:01.918
Leave me!

01:21:02.168 --> 01:21:04.043
Leave me in peace!

01:21:04.293 --> 01:21:08.585
Suffering for you, <i>sans pause!</i>
Always you! Everything for you!

01:21:08.793 --> 01:21:12.293
Keep your suffering!
I don't need your stupid suffering!

01:21:12.710 --> 01:21:15.585
How dare you speak to your mother so!
You beast!

01:21:16.085 --> 01:21:17.918
I've had enough! That's it!

01:21:18.168 --> 01:21:20.626
- All of it!
- Enough, Mrs von Paradis!

01:21:20.835 --> 01:21:24.710
- That's enough!
- I decide that. You lout! Swindler!

01:21:24.918 --> 01:21:27.501
Stay away from her! Filthy bastard!

01:21:31.543 --> 01:21:34.835
Help me! Do something!
Are you stupid or something?

01:21:37.585 --> 01:21:40.293
Everything has gone black again!

01:21:40.501 --> 01:21:41.626
Therese!

01:21:41.835 --> 01:21:44.501
Look. Do you see my hand?

01:21:46.501 --> 01:21:47.460
No.

01:21:48.876 --> 01:21:50.668
No! No! No! No!

01:21:50.876 --> 01:21:51.668
No!

01:22:52.585 --> 01:22:54.210
I'm sorry.

01:22:55.251 --> 01:22:58.251
Your father decides for you, not me.

01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:00.085
I want to stay here.

01:23:00.293 --> 01:23:01.876
Write and tell him that.

01:23:02.126 --> 01:23:05.418
Miss Paradis, I fear what you want
will not tip the scales.

01:23:06.335 --> 01:23:08.001
If I return I'll go blind again.

01:23:08.585 --> 01:23:11.126
Don't be unreasonable.

01:23:11.335 --> 01:23:16.543
Reasonable or unreasonable,
it seems being unreasonable won't help.

01:23:17.210 --> 01:23:19.376
We'll do another demonstration.

01:23:19.585 --> 01:23:22.543
And another, and another.

01:23:22.751 --> 01:23:25.460
Until everyone has seen
that I can see again.

01:23:34.501 --> 01:23:39.418
Father is coming, and Mother too.
With Störck, the Academy and nobility.

01:23:41.876 --> 01:23:44.793
He wants to show everyone
that you can see again.

01:23:47.210 --> 01:23:49.751
That I know it myself is enough for me.

01:23:54.585 --> 01:23:56.210
Are you sick again?

01:23:59.585 --> 01:24:01.251
I'll sing something to you.

01:24:03.585 --> 01:24:07.418
<i>I was a little nipper</i>

01:24:08.043 --> 01:24:11.876
<i>No more than four spans long</i>

01:24:12.126 --> 01:24:14.751
<i>And golden grapes in a bower</i>

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:17.418
<i>I was picking at that hour</i>

01:24:17.585 --> 01:24:21.085
<i>As Mother held me fast and strong</i>

01:24:21.918 --> 01:24:25.376
<i>A black dragon did arise</i>

01:24:25.585 --> 01:24:28.460
<i>That Mother did not spy</i>

01:24:29.168 --> 01:24:32.001
<i>From a putrid pool</i>

01:24:32.918 --> 01:24:36.710
<i>Black bolts of lightning he did spew</i>

01:24:36.918 --> 01:24:40.460
<i>And his poison on my face blew</i>

01:24:42.335 --> 01:24:45.793
<i>All went suddenly dark</i>

01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:49.293
<i>And solitude around me did reign</i>

01:24:50.418 --> 01:24:53.460
<i>My eyes no longer could</i>

01:24:53.626 --> 01:24:57.001
<i>Take in the light as they should</i>

01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:00.668
<i>The sun</i>

01:25:00.876 --> 01:25:07.835
<i>The sun did not shine anymore</i>

01:25:34.210 --> 01:25:36.960
Esteemed guests,
sadly, I must disappoint you.

01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:39.960
There will be no demonstration.

01:25:40.168 --> 01:25:44.210
<i>Malheureusement.</i>
Court Physician Störck is indisposed.

01:25:44.418 --> 01:25:47.918
<i>Monsieur le docteur,</i>
how is one to construe this?

01:25:48.168 --> 01:25:51.543
One wishes to see the proceedings
and is ushered out?

01:25:51.751 --> 01:25:53.585
<i>Excusez-moi,</i>
I must ask you to leave.

01:25:53.793 --> 01:25:56.501
Not much of a turnout, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

01:25:56.710 --> 01:25:58.293
Do not be insolent.

01:25:58.501 --> 01:26:01.585
Do you wish
to keep the mademoiselle from us?

01:26:01.793 --> 01:26:04.293
Because you want
to keep her to yourself?

01:26:04.835 --> 01:26:06.960
What impertinence!

01:26:07.168 --> 01:26:09.335
Have the young lady dance.

01:26:11.626 --> 01:26:12.585
Come now!

01:26:13.626 --> 01:26:17.668
No need for rudeness.
We've seen enough, right Luzia?

01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:24.001
Charlatan!

01:26:24.210 --> 01:26:26.960
We take our leave
from the ass!

01:27:14.668 --> 01:27:19.835
Your father vows to bring you here
for any possible treatments.

01:27:24.626 --> 01:27:26.710
So you're abandoning me now.

01:27:34.126 --> 01:27:35.085
Adieu.

01:27:36.168 --> 01:27:37.626
Adieu.

01:28:08.585 --> 01:28:10.835
Something is knocking about
in the big case.

01:28:11.043 --> 01:28:12.918
Perhaps I should've been there.

01:28:13.168 --> 01:28:16.668
Even if only half of it is intact,
I wouldn't have let you in that house.

01:28:18.501 --> 01:28:21.543
I'm certain it will all be fine, Josef.

01:29:53.251 --> 01:29:56.501
Can you play something more agreeable?
That's so serious.

01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:01.126
They say lots of people will be here.
That's good.

01:30:01.335 --> 01:30:06.126
An empty hall after a long journey,
that would be embarrassing.

01:30:06.335 --> 01:30:09.710
And Mrs von Roche vowed to come.
Just imagine...

01:30:09.918 --> 01:30:11.710
<i>Maman!</i>

01:30:11.918 --> 01:30:14.376
I have to concentrate. Please.
