00:01.102 --> 00:04.004
*

00:08.209 --> 00:11.245
The bidding stands
at eight million dollars.

00:11.279 --> 00:12.313
Nine million.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.414
Ten million.

00:13.447 --> 00:14.415
11 million!

00:14.448 --> 00:17.085
$15 million.

00:17.118 --> 00:19.587
Joan Miró's The Poetess,

00:19.620 --> 00:22.556
going once, going twice, sold.

00:22.590 --> 00:25.259
To billionaire tech mogul
Megan Matheson.

00:25.293 --> 00:27.261
-Hmph.
-(shudders)

00:27.295 --> 00:29.563
(groans)

00:29.597 --> 00:31.399
LISA:
Mmm.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.367
(Homer growls)

00:33.401 --> 00:35.869
Don't take that painting,
I love it!

00:35.903 --> 00:38.372
I won't let you take it!

01:03.264 --> 01:05.399
There you have it,
Ms. Matheson,

01:05.433 --> 01:09.303
Joan Miró's The Poetess.

01:09.337 --> 01:10.571
(gasps)

01:10.604 --> 01:12.473
My painting's been stolen.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.275
That's impossible.

01:14.308 --> 01:18.078
It's a mystery so baffling,
only one man can solve it.

01:18.112 --> 01:20.781
Get me Manacek.

01:20.814 --> 01:22.783
(ringing)

01:22.816 --> 01:24.652
(Banacek theme song playing)

01:48.276 --> 01:50.278
*

02:19.207 --> 02:21.209
*

02:30.017 --> 02:32.653
Thank goodness you're here,
Mr. Manacek.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.855
You're the best freelance
insurance investigator

02:34.888 --> 02:36.657
in the business.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.158
Oh, well, isn't that
just what we need?

02:38.192 --> 02:42.162
Some smug pretty boy
out to make us cops look stupid.

02:42.196 --> 02:44.865
Ah, Clancy,
you're looking well...

02:44.898 --> 02:46.867
-fed.
-Uh-- see?

02:46.900 --> 02:50.037
He put that pause between
those two words deliberately.

02:50.070 --> 02:53.341
Maybe I did, maybe I... didn't.

02:53.374 --> 02:56.444
Well, two can play at that...

02:58.546 --> 03:00.013
...pause.

03:00.047 --> 03:02.049
Three people bid
on the stolen painting:

03:02.082 --> 03:03.717
nuclear magnate Mr. Burns,

03:03.751 --> 03:05.553
venture capitalist
Megan Matheson

03:05.586 --> 03:07.755
and mini golf cheat
Homer Simpson.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.189
They're all suspects.

03:09.223 --> 03:10.758
I don't mind
telling you, Manacek:

03:10.791 --> 03:13.093
I hope you fall flat
on your face.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.362
(chuckling):
Oh.

03:14.395 --> 03:15.563
I hope not.

03:15.596 --> 03:17.231
My mother's rather fond of it.

03:17.265 --> 03:18.866
Damn your wit.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.901
*

03:36.884 --> 03:39.887
(sighs) Look, Manacek, I don't
know why you're talking to me.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.590
It's my painting
that was stolen.

03:42.623 --> 03:45.593
Yes, but you insured
a $15 million painting

03:45.626 --> 03:47.595
for $30 million.

03:47.628 --> 03:50.798
For a woman with a head
for numbers, it doesn't add up.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.933
You smug son of a bitch.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.435
(laughs)

03:54.468 --> 03:56.270
I like you, Manacek.

03:56.304 --> 03:59.139
But you should be talking
to the real painting thief:

03:59.172 --> 04:02.743
the man I outbid,
Montgomery Burns.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.613
That's quite a workout
you're getting.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.948
Although, I can think
of a better one.

04:07.981 --> 04:10.484
Sorry, but I'm in
a committed relationship

04:10.518 --> 04:12.620
with the former Miss Denmark.

04:12.653 --> 04:15.989
She's created a breed
of mosquito that cures malaria.

04:16.023 --> 04:19.760
Well, if she invents a cure
for commitment, let me know.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.795
*

04:27.801 --> 04:28.936
Pull.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.504
Shoot.

04:30.538 --> 04:32.306
Nice shot, Mr. Burns.

04:32.340 --> 04:35.309
You're a natural
in the ancient art of skeet.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.611
Oh, spare me
your flattery, Manacek.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.112
I know why you're here.

04:39.146 --> 04:40.848
You think I stole
that ridiculous painting.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.115
Absurd.

04:42.149 --> 04:45.118
A little clay pigeon told me

04:45.152 --> 04:49.022
that you couldn't stand
being outbid by... a woman.

04:49.056 --> 04:52.493
Pull, pull, pull!

04:54.995 --> 04:56.997
Looks like the only thing being
hit around here...

04:57.030 --> 04:58.666
is a nerve.

04:58.699 --> 05:01.502
I'll blast that smile
right off your smug face.

05:01.535 --> 05:02.870
(laughs)

05:02.903 --> 05:04.672
I like you, Manacek.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.840
But it's obvious
who took the painting.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.876
That lunatic who said he'd do
anything to have it:

05:08.909 --> 05:11.679
Homer Simpson.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.814
I... Did you bring that
with you?

05:13.847 --> 05:15.383
It's inflatable.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.485
I got it at Brookstone.

05:17.518 --> 05:20.253
*

05:28.261 --> 05:31.031
I don't know what help I can be
with your case, Mr. Manacek.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.701
As you can see,
I'm a very busy man.

05:33.734 --> 05:37.405
(imitating beeping sounds)

05:37.438 --> 05:40.508
According to my sources--
Lenny--

05:40.541 --> 05:41.875
you were obsessed
with that painting.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.411
I myself was once obsessed

05:43.444 --> 05:45.713
with a suede sports jacket
with leather pockets.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.548
I would have done anything
to get it.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.249
Even steal a painting.

05:49.282 --> 05:52.252
Me? Obsessed with
some stupid painting?

05:52.285 --> 05:54.054
That's absurd.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.389
(yelps)

05:55.423 --> 05:57.357
-Is it?
-You're right.

05:57.391 --> 05:59.059
I'd do anything
to have that painting.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.194
Lie, kill, steal.
Well, not kill.

06:01.228 --> 06:03.196
But I would steal it,
and then lie about it.

06:03.230 --> 06:04.264
But I didn't steal it.

06:04.297 --> 06:05.399
And I'm not lying.

06:05.433 --> 06:06.767
Believe me, or I'll kill you.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.235
(chuckles)

06:08.268 --> 06:09.903
I like you, Manacek.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.038
I'll kill you!

06:11.071 --> 06:12.239
(chuckles)

06:12.272 --> 06:13.674
I like you.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.876
Mr. Simpson,
there's more to your story

06:15.909 --> 06:17.545
than you're letting on.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.513
And I'm gonna find out what.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.415
Please don't.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.050
(classical music playing)

06:25.453 --> 06:27.588
(doorbell rings)

06:27.621 --> 06:29.389
Wow.

06:29.423 --> 06:32.760
The pizza delivery boys get
better looking all the time.

06:32.793 --> 06:35.395
I'm Homer Simpson's wife.

06:35.429 --> 06:38.098
I love wives. They never
pester you to marry them.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.434
Geez, you've got a lot of lines.

06:40.468 --> 06:44.438
You will too, after I show you
my corduroy sheets.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.774
Mr. Manacek,
my husband is a wreck.

06:46.807 --> 06:50.911
Please, just give me a chance
to convince you he's innocent.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.446
Only if it's over dinner.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.548
Uh, okay.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.917
More Frito pie, Mr. Manacek?

06:56.950 --> 06:58.118
(sighs)

06:58.151 --> 07:00.153
Sure, why not?

07:06.827 --> 07:08.896
If he's not guilty
of stealing that painting,

07:08.929 --> 07:10.731
why is Homer cowering
on the stairs,

07:10.764 --> 07:13.366
eating cereal
straight from the box?

07:14.702 --> 07:17.070
(whimpering)

07:17.104 --> 07:19.239
Well, Homer's so quick to panic.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.774
It's his only flaw.

07:20.808 --> 07:23.310
Marge, I need you
to be straight with me.

07:23.343 --> 07:25.846
Okay, I admit it,
he has many flaws.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.180
Thousands. Flaws.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.982
Everywhere, flaws.

07:29.016 --> 07:31.351
Your husband doesn't really seem
like a typical art lover,

07:31.384 --> 07:33.453
but he shows exquisite taste

07:33.487 --> 07:36.524
in the female form.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.692
Hey, Front Pockets,
quit hitting on my mom.

07:38.726 --> 07:42.863
She only loves one stocky man
in tight pants: our dad.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.865
Sorry, I can only solve
impossible crimes

07:44.898 --> 07:46.600
if I'm seducing
an amazing woman.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.335
It's my process.

07:48.368 --> 07:50.037
I'll tell you everything I know
about Homer

07:50.070 --> 07:51.705
for one of those Tiparillos.

07:51.739 --> 07:53.206
No Tiparillos.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.875
BOTH:
(scoffs) Women.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.043
(chuckles)

07:56.076 --> 07:57.444
I like you, Manacek.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.112
So let me clue you in
on the real story

07:59.146 --> 08:00.848
about my dad and that painting.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.617
Homer was chaperoning my class
field trip to the art museum,

08:03.651 --> 08:06.453
and he was not happy about it.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.788
Come on, come on.
Hurry up in there.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.356
Three to a urinal.

08:09.389 --> 08:12.192
No hand washing,
or we'll be late for lunch.

08:12.225 --> 08:13.393
(groans)

08:13.426 --> 08:14.728
Hmm?

08:14.762 --> 08:17.197
HOMER: Sheesh, look at
that stupid painting.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.799
What is it even supposed to be?

08:18.832 --> 08:20.467
Art should be of pretty ladies,

08:20.500 --> 08:22.970
hunting dogs with dead rabbits,
Bible crap

08:23.003 --> 08:24.538
and 3-D sidewalk drawings

08:24.572 --> 08:26.239
where it looks like
you could fall in.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.275
*

08:41.421 --> 08:43.791
(whirring)

08:47.060 --> 08:49.162
HOMER:
I get it.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.431
I... get... it.

08:51.464 --> 08:54.602
Mr. Simpson, some of the kids
went to the gift shop.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.937
We were only supposed
to bring five dollars,

08:56.970 --> 08:58.606
but some brought more.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.273
Wha-Wha... What?

09:00.307 --> 09:02.610
Oh, right. Chaperone.

09:02.643 --> 09:06.647
Hmm... mmm?

09:12.219 --> 09:14.955
This is warm beer.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.957
That's an '07 Michelob.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.426
Homer was saving it
for a special occasion.

09:21.829 --> 09:24.131
Mmm. Yes.

09:24.164 --> 09:27.635
My husband just couldn't stop
thinking about that painting.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.637
*

09:29.670 --> 09:31.672
(laughing)

09:37.077 --> 09:39.079
(giggles)

09:40.180 --> 09:42.582
(belches)

09:44.184 --> 09:46.186
(humming)

09:50.123 --> 09:51.091
(exhales)

09:51.124 --> 09:54.327
Wha...? Honey,

09:54.361 --> 09:56.396
I love a painting.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.632
Oh, what is it of? Grapes?

09:58.666 --> 10:00.968
-No.
-Flowers?

10:01.001 --> 10:02.335
-No.
-Peaches?

10:02.369 --> 10:03.937
No.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.472
You sure it's a painting?

10:05.505 --> 10:08.241
I'm positive. I touched it
when no one was looking.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.678
Well, there's nothing wrong
with being an art lover

10:10.711 --> 10:12.846
as long
as it's representational.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.014
Mmm...

10:14.047 --> 10:16.650
It i representational,
isn't it?

10:16.684 --> 10:19.920
-(groans)
-Tell me it's representational.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.923
-(groans)
-What else
about our marriage is a lie?

10:22.956 --> 10:25.192
Are you really
a licensed DJ?

10:25.225 --> 10:27.227
I took the courses,
but I failed the test!

10:28.696 --> 10:31.498
A blue-collar Joe
suddenly likes modern art?

10:31.531 --> 10:33.701
That story and two bits
will get you a cup of coffee.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.703
What year do you think it is?

10:35.736 --> 10:37.437
Hey, who's the shamus here?

10:37.470 --> 10:39.172
I'm telling you, deep down,

10:39.206 --> 10:41.441
my dad is really sensitive.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.210
-(honks saxophone)
-(screams)

10:43.243 --> 10:45.212
(panting)

10:45.245 --> 10:46.847
Oh, good, you're awake.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.783
You're the only one
I can talk to about... this.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.284
I know that painting.

10:51.318 --> 10:54.221
It's called The Poetess
by Joan Miró.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.890
Why does it bring me such peace?

10:56.924 --> 10:58.692
Why?!

10:58.726 --> 11:01.028
See? Even though
the painting is abstract,

11:01.061 --> 11:03.697
that yellow circle
can represent the sun.

11:03.731 --> 11:06.333
HOMER:
Or Pac-Man at rest.

11:06.366 --> 11:09.502
Dad, you think art sucks.
Snap out of it.

11:11.438 --> 11:14.574
HOMER:
Wow. I mean, wow.

11:14.607 --> 11:16.643
Every time I look at it
from a different angle,

11:16.676 --> 11:19.179
-I see something new.
-(groans)

11:20.881 --> 11:22.182
I just want to take a moment

11:22.215 --> 11:24.051
to acknowledge
that for the first time,

11:24.084 --> 11:26.820
you're dragging me
into the museum.

11:26.854 --> 11:29.256
Yeah, it's a topsy-turvy world.

11:29.289 --> 11:32.125
Beach volleyball's bigger
than regular volleyball.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.064
Sorry, pally. Sorry, gally.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.266
But the museum's
closed down for good.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.334
-(gasps)
-(gasps) Can we go in and look

11:41.368 --> 11:43.336
at our favorite painting
one last time?

11:43.370 --> 11:45.038
It's called The Poetess.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.007
Oh, it's right there,
inside the crate

11:47.040 --> 11:48.508
that's going
to the auction house,

11:48.541 --> 11:49.943
where a billionaire will buy it

11:49.977 --> 11:51.611
and you'll never see it again.

11:51.644 --> 11:53.814
Oh, and I'll have to
take that, too.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.450
(Homer whimpers)

11:57.484 --> 11:59.586
Now museum, now you don't.

11:59.619 --> 12:01.454
The Springfield Museum
of Fine Art

12:01.488 --> 12:03.857
is the latest victim
of this city's budget woes.

12:03.891 --> 12:06.626
The storied institution
has closed its doors forever.

12:06.659 --> 12:09.096
Its legendary art collection
will be sold at auction

12:09.129 --> 12:11.464
and its docents
released into the wild.

12:11.498 --> 12:12.966
The closure is being protested

12:13.000 --> 12:14.534
by a coalition
of local art lovers

12:14.567 --> 12:16.469
and homeless bathroom users.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.305
(chanting):
Picasso, Goya,

12:18.338 --> 12:20.207
Cézanne, Dalí,

12:20.240 --> 12:21.942
selling off artwork

12:21.975 --> 12:23.543
would be folly.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.945
(all cheer)

12:24.978 --> 12:28.448
We're here, Vermeer,
get used to it!

12:28.481 --> 12:30.717
People, people.
Government is about

12:30.750 --> 12:32.652
making tough choices.

12:32.685 --> 12:34.487
This was not one of them.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.623
Museum attendance was near zero.

12:36.656 --> 12:39.126
We lost thousands
on stolen audio wands.

12:39.159 --> 12:42.162
What do people want with wands?

12:43.196 --> 12:44.664
These wands

12:44.697 --> 12:46.499
are putting the hurt
on these walnuts.

12:46.533 --> 12:49.402
MAN (over wand): Notice how
Edward Hopper's use of windows

12:49.436 --> 12:51.571
invites the viewer
into the scene

12:51.604 --> 12:53.306
but also keeps them at bay.

12:53.340 --> 12:54.908
-(wand chimes)
-(grunts)

12:54.942 --> 12:56.009
But Mayor Quimby,

12:56.043 --> 12:57.677
the Springfield Museum
of Fine Art,

12:57.710 --> 12:59.646
or SMOFA, was a jewel.

12:59.679 --> 13:02.649
SMOFA was the one institution
of genuine culture

13:02.682 --> 13:04.317
our town could be proud of.

13:04.351 --> 13:05.853
Stop saying SMOFA.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.320
It never caught on.

13:07.354 --> 13:08.922
Um, excuse me, Mayor SMOFA.

13:08.956 --> 13:10.991
I'm not like these brainy
tote bags over here.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.827
I like my crusts stuffed,
my martial arts mixed,

13:13.861 --> 13:16.196
and my movies fully Sandler-ed.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.531
But there's this painting
from that museum,

13:18.565 --> 13:20.167
and when I really look at it,

13:20.200 --> 13:22.769
only one word
explains what I feel.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.038
-What is it again?
-(whispers)

13:25.072 --> 13:27.875
-Transgender.
-(whispers)

13:27.908 --> 13:29.843
Transcendent.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.879
Transcendence
doesn't fill potholes

13:31.912 --> 13:33.280
or educate our children.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.948
Did you know we had to lay off

13:34.982 --> 13:36.783
a third of the police force?

13:36.816 --> 13:38.685
That's right. Eddie.

13:39.719 --> 13:41.354
I used to have a gun.

13:41.388 --> 13:43.223
(grunts)

13:45.758 --> 13:47.694
Fine, sell the artwork.

13:47.727 --> 13:49.963
Let's move on
to the next protest:

13:49.997 --> 13:53.700
too many poke restaurants.

13:53.733 --> 13:55.635
(chanting):
Poke is just okay.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.338
Poke is just okay.

13:59.606 --> 14:02.075
At Water's Edge
by Paul Cézanne,

14:02.109 --> 14:05.078
sold for $65 million.

14:05.112 --> 14:08.415
Yeah! I'm as happy
as Steve Martin.

14:08.448 --> 14:11.952
It's... Oh, God, no.

14:13.286 --> 14:16.756
Our last item is The Poetess
by Joan Miró.

14:16.789 --> 14:19.659
The bidding starts
at five million dollars.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.228
HOMER:
I bid that.

14:21.261 --> 14:24.264
-What are you doing?
-I have a plan to get
the painting.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.933
Six million dollars.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.301
WOMAN:
I think we can do
better than that.

14:29.469 --> 14:30.837
I need this painting

14:30.870 --> 14:33.006
for my private monkey sanctuary
in Costa Rica.

14:33.040 --> 14:36.443
The monkeys find the colors
quite arousing.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.245
Seven million dollars.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.180
-Eight million.
-Nine million.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.682
Sir, we attempted
to verify your funds

14:42.715 --> 14:44.284
at the First Bank of Moe's.

14:44.317 --> 14:47.087
The man at the phone
threatened to boil our skulls

14:47.120 --> 14:48.421
and make them into...

14:48.455 --> 14:50.490
(inhales)
...rat toilets.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.127
-(groans)
-It's okay, Dad.

14:54.161 --> 14:56.296
You just really loved
that painting.

14:56.329 --> 14:59.399
The bidding stands
at eight million dollars.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.434
-Nine million.
-Ten million.

15:01.468 --> 15:02.435
11 million.

15:02.469 --> 15:05.138
$15 million.

15:05.172 --> 15:07.640
Joan Miró's The Poetess,

15:07.674 --> 15:10.477
going once, going twice, sold.

15:10.510 --> 15:13.313
To billionaire tech mogul
Megan Matheson.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.315
-Hmph.
-(shudders)

15:15.348 --> 15:17.617
(groans)

15:17.650 --> 15:19.152
LISA:
Mmm.

15:19.186 --> 15:21.154
(Homer growls)

15:21.188 --> 15:23.656
Don't take that painting,
I love it!

15:23.690 --> 15:26.393
I won't let you take it!

15:26.426 --> 15:27.995
Your story had everything--

15:28.028 --> 15:30.830
a field trip, a dream sequence,
Sideshow Mel--

15:30.863 --> 15:33.633
and it gave your father
the perfect motive

15:33.666 --> 15:35.068
to steal that painting:

15:35.102 --> 15:37.337
a deeper connection
to his daughter.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.906
Well, maybe,
but I'm sure he's innocent.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.409
Mom, Lisa, 1970s horndog,

15:42.442 --> 15:43.743
Dad's run off.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.445
He's on the lam!

15:45.478 --> 15:47.914
You know, once I send
your husband to prison,

15:47.947 --> 15:50.483
you'll be kind of single.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.485
(chuckles)

15:52.519 --> 15:54.021
(soft grumbling)

15:56.456 --> 16:00.360
MANACEK: It seems Homer escaped
out this window.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.195
Hmm.

16:02.229 --> 16:04.331
In all my years
as an investigator,

16:04.364 --> 16:06.966
I've never seen a trellis
take such a pounding.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.368
I know it looks bad,

16:08.401 --> 16:10.170
but think
about what we told you.

16:10.203 --> 16:13.540
My husband could never
have stolen that painting.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.208
Hmm.
Thank you, Marge.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.710
I now know exactly
how everything happened.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.146
How do you know that?

16:19.179 --> 16:20.680
I'll be happy to explain...

16:20.713 --> 16:22.382
over breakfast?

16:22.415 --> 16:25.285
(grumbles) You have
a real problem with women.

16:25.318 --> 16:28.188
I know.
I'm seeing a therapist...

16:28.221 --> 16:30.557
tonight at my place.

16:30.590 --> 16:33.193
Oh, get out.
Go, go!

16:36.929 --> 16:39.032
(sighs)

16:39.066 --> 16:41.868
White chocolate--
the loneliest chocolate.

16:41.901 --> 16:44.371
MANACEK:
Homer, I know you're in there.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.039
(gasps)
How did you find me?

16:46.073 --> 16:48.075
I knew you'd return
to the scene of the crime:

16:48.108 --> 16:50.143
where your inner peace
was stolen.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.079
You can't bring me in.
You're not a cop.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.547
You're not even a regular
insurance investigator.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.383
You're freelance.
You don't get paid

16:56.416 --> 16:58.017
unless you submit an invoice.

16:58.051 --> 17:01.421
Which lets me control
when my corporate year ends.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.656
You're always one step ahead.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.158
(laughs)

17:05.192 --> 17:07.427
I don't like you, Manacek.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.496
Your family's story
of how you fell in love

17:09.529 --> 17:11.531
with that painting
did prove your innocence.

17:11.564 --> 17:14.101
-How?
-By providing one crucial fact:

17:14.134 --> 17:15.868
you're too dumb
to steal anything.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.270
Maybe I did take it.

17:17.304 --> 17:19.772
-Trust me, you didn't.
-I could have.

17:19.806 --> 17:22.008
But I know you didn't.
That's what I'm saying.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.211
-I'm smart.
-You're dumb.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.880
After careful consideration
of facts and evidence

17:27.914 --> 17:29.282
observed only by me,

17:29.316 --> 17:31.718
I can reveal
who stole The Poetess:

17:31.751 --> 17:33.220
Ms. Matheson.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.287
(all gasp)

17:34.321 --> 17:36.289
Your last IPO was DOA,

17:36.323 --> 17:38.291
and you needed the cash
to keep your girlfriend

17:38.325 --> 17:39.926
in hybrid mosquito larva.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.928
I've seen it a thousand times.

17:41.961 --> 17:43.630
Impossible!
The armed guards

17:43.663 --> 17:45.632
never let the painting
out of their sight.

17:45.665 --> 17:49.469
But which armed guards?

17:49.502 --> 17:52.572
It was a simple matter
of finding

17:52.605 --> 17:54.107
the guards' identical twins,

17:54.141 --> 17:56.909
then hiring them to rob
their own brothers.

17:58.345 --> 18:00.313
That's the last
impossible mystery

18:00.347 --> 18:03.283
you'll ever solve.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.418
Well done, Mr. Manacek.

18:05.452 --> 18:06.986
Who would have suspected

18:07.019 --> 18:09.289
it was the person none of us
had ever met before?

18:09.322 --> 18:11.824
Yes, it's a shame she went
through all that trouble

18:11.858 --> 18:13.160
to steal a painting...

18:13.193 --> 18:15.162
that had already been stolen...

18:15.195 --> 18:17.297
by you.

18:17.330 --> 18:19.266
Uh, not yet, sir.

18:19.299 --> 18:22.469
I mean, how dare you accuse me
of such a crime?

18:22.502 --> 18:24.337
But the painting
was safely in our vault

18:24.371 --> 18:26.506
until it left the auction house.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.642
But which auction house?

18:29.676 --> 18:31.444
It was a simple matter

18:31.478 --> 18:33.846
of Burns building
an identical auction house

18:33.880 --> 18:35.515
next door to the real one.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.450
The actual painting
never left the vault,

18:37.484 --> 18:40.853
so Burns could steal it
at his leisure.

18:40.887 --> 18:43.156
-Now?
-Yes, sir.

18:50.997 --> 18:52.465
(gasps)
My painting!

18:52.499 --> 18:55.134
Oh, thank goodness
those thieves didn't get you.

18:55.168 --> 18:58.538
It's a shame I punched out
a woman and an old man over...

18:58.571 --> 19:00.640
a gift shop tote bag.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.642
(all gasp)

19:02.675 --> 19:03.810
Lisa?

19:03.843 --> 19:07.180
(sighs)
It wasn't my plan to steal it.

19:09.081 --> 19:11.318
That painting
was the first thing

19:11.351 --> 19:13.653
my dad and I
ever had in common.

19:13.686 --> 19:16.356
I couldn't bear
to see him lose it.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.991
It was a simple matter

19:19.025 --> 19:21.528
of switching my canvas tote bag
for the painting

19:21.561 --> 19:24.431
before it was
even auctioned off.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.200
I knew it was wrong,

19:27.234 --> 19:28.868
but isn't it a worse crime

19:28.901 --> 19:30.337
to let some billionaire

19:30.370 --> 19:32.071
hide art away

19:32.104 --> 19:35.442
where guys like my dad
can never fall in love with it?

19:39.946 --> 19:42.081
So, who gets The Poetess now?

19:42.114 --> 19:43.750
Ten million dollars.

19:43.783 --> 19:46.085
Ownership of the painting
reverts back to the city.

19:46.118 --> 19:47.587
But where will we hang it?

19:47.620 --> 19:49.589
We're knocking down
the art museum.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.591
And what are you doing
with the money Springfield got

19:51.624 --> 19:53.092
from selling
all the public's art?

19:53.125 --> 19:55.262
Well, uh, we're, uh, building

19:55.295 --> 19:58.030
certain vitally needed
civic improvements.

20:01.468 --> 20:03.703
Everything I love
in one place.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.872
Beer. Hot dog.

20:05.905 --> 20:09.208
Bathroom. Painting. Daughter.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.777
Marge, you're a beautiful woman,

20:10.810 --> 20:12.379
but you're loyal
to your husband.

20:12.412 --> 20:13.946
And I respect that.

20:13.980 --> 20:17.284
But if things were different,
would I have a shot?

20:17.317 --> 20:19.952
You are the most conceited,

20:19.986 --> 20:22.255
chauvinistic, son of a...

20:22.289 --> 20:25.292
(chuckles)
I like you, Manacek.

20:29.095 --> 20:31.097
(Banacek theme song playing)

20:39.238 --> 20:41.408
(Banacek theme song playing)

21:19.111 --> 21:21.113
Shh!
