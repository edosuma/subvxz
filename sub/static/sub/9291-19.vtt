00:14.760 --> 00:16.440
There's a convoy missing.

00:16.520 --> 00:20.520
It was headed from Illinois to lowa.
It disappeared inside the border.

00:20.600 --> 00:24.360
- Disappeared?
- They were due to call in. They didn't.

00:24.440 --> 00:26.640
I tried on comm stat. There was no reply.

00:26.720 --> 00:29.680
- What was on the trucks?
- A nuclear warhead.

00:29.760 --> 00:32.119
- They found us.
- Where are you?

00:32.200 --> 00:34.560
It's over. They're gonna get us.

00:34.640 --> 00:36.960
You have to kill Prado.
He knows too much.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.760
- " Drop the gun.
- " Put the gun down!

00:42.840 --> 00:46.720
- Who are you?
- My name's Joe Prado. I'm innocent.

00:46.800 --> 00:50.200
Mr Prado's rights will not be violated.
Take me to him now.

00:50.280 --> 00:54.960
- We have no choice, Curtis.
- A warhead's missing. This is our only lead.

00:55.040 --> 00:59.840
What's going on? You've got a key witness.
We should be pressing this guy.

00:59.920 --> 01:00.960
It's Mike Novick.

01:01.040 --> 01:04.519
If we want information, we're gonna
have to do it behind closed doors.

01:04.599 --> 01:08.200
- Torture him?
- I'm talking about what is necessary

01:08.280 --> 01:10.200
to stop this warhead being used against us.

01:10.280 --> 01:13.800
All right, gentlemen.
I'll have an answer in 20 minutes.

01:13.880 --> 01:16.720
This thing could be over in 20 minutes.

01:16.800 --> 01:20.480
What if I find a way
that wouldn't implicate anyone else but me?

01:20.560 --> 01:23.480
- " I'm not gonna authorise that.
- You don't have to.

01:23.560 --> 01:26.320
- What do you mean?
- Accept my resignation.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.960
- And if I do that, what then?
- Release the suspect.

01:29.040 --> 01:31.320
- Now you're throwing me out.
- Right.

01:32.280 --> 01:35.280
Make a sound and I will blow your brains
all over the windshield.

01:35.360 --> 01:36.920
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

01:37.000 --> 01:39.440
Where is Marwan?

01:39.520 --> 01:44.440
OK. OK. OK. Marwan's... Marwan's
gonna be at a place called The Hub tonight.

01:44.520 --> 01:47.280
- Where is it?
- It's... It's just...

01:47.360 --> 01:51.080
- Where is it?
- Just east of downtown.

01:51.160 --> 01:53.160
This will help you with the pain.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.920
- " Yes, sir?"
- The White House.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.560
- "President Logan?"
- No, Mike Novick.

02:24.640 --> 02:26.640
One moment, please.

02:32.160 --> 02:38.160
- "We're still trying to locate Mr Novick."
- Call me when you've got him on the line.

02:42.440 --> 02:44.440
What happened?

02:44.520 --> 02:46.600
- Prado talked.
- Who did this?

02:46.680 --> 02:48.480
- Audrey...
- I represent DOD.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.920
I have a right to know, Bill.

02:51.840 --> 02:54.280
Did Jack do this?

02:55.680 --> 02:57.400
Yes, he did.

02:57.480 --> 03:00.480
It was the only way to get him
to give up Marwan's location.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.120
President Logan gave Jack
the authority to use force?

03:03.200 --> 03:06.160
No, Audrey. The president didn't.

03:07.160 --> 03:09.160
Where's Jack now?

03:09.240 --> 03:12.320
He's prepping a team to apprehend Marwan.

03:21.080 --> 03:22.680
Curtis.

03:22.760 --> 03:26.200
- You want to utilise LAPD?
- They'll lock down a ten-block perimeter.

03:26.280 --> 03:30.760
Marwan's people are coming and going.
If we lock down, we give them a heads-up.

03:30.840 --> 03:34.200
All right. We'll stay invisible.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.920
Excuse me for one second.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.720
What is it?

03:38.800 --> 03:41.600
The clinic are treating Prado
for multiple injuries.

03:41.680 --> 03:45.160
Audrey, what do you expect me to do?
Marwan has a nuclear warhead.

03:45.240 --> 03:48.840
- He'll use it unless we find him first.
- I understand the situation.

03:48.920 --> 03:52.640
Then you know what I did was necessary.
At least now we know where he is.

03:52.720 --> 03:56.080
Logan gave you an order
not to use extreme interrogation methods

03:56.160 --> 03:58.280
without his authorisation.

03:58.360 --> 04:01.400
- Jack, you are acting against the president.
- I know.

04:01.480 --> 04:04.240
- Jack, we're set.
- I'll be right there.

04:04.320 --> 04:08.000
- All right, everyone. Let's move out.
- Look, I've gotta go.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.560
Jack, you can't keep walking outside the line
and not expect consequences.

04:11.640 --> 04:15.400
Trust me, no one understands
the consequences better than me. No one.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.920
Jack...

04:21.120 --> 04:23.640
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

04:23.720 --> 04:27.320
- Just asking.
- I'm sorry. I'm fine.

04:28.080 --> 04:33.160
Look, for whatever it's worth,
you did the right thing with Prado.

04:35.880 --> 04:37.880
Thanks.

04:44.520 --> 04:48.960
Authorising the torture of a foreign national
is one thing, but torturing a US citizen...

04:49.040 --> 04:51.200
- I can't...
- Sir.

04:52.280 --> 04:56.400
This man, Prado, has information
on the whereabouts of a nuclear warhead.

04:56.480 --> 04:58.920
- We don't know that for sure.
- No, sir, we don't,

04:59.000 --> 05:03.840
because you're not letting
CTU do what they need to do.

05:06.680 --> 05:10.600
I wanna wait till the attorney general
gets back to me with an opinion.

05:10.680 --> 05:14.400
Mr President, we are running out of time.

05:16.160 --> 05:19.560
Walt, you were the first one
to raise an objection to this.

05:19.640 --> 05:23.360
- What do you think now?
- I think you need to make a decision, sir.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.920
And sooner rather than later.

05:27.040 --> 05:31.840
Mr Novick, Buchanan's on the phone from
CTU. He's called twice. He says it's urgent.

05:31.920 --> 05:34.600
- I'll be right there.
- Yes, sir.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.360
What should I tell him?

05:44.640 --> 05:48.440
- Mr President...
- Don't press me for an answer I can't give yet!

05:54.040 --> 05:56.600
I need more time.

06:13.840 --> 06:17.640
Sorry about the delay. The president
is working through his decision.

06:17.720 --> 06:20.000
The president won't have
to make that call.

06:20.080 --> 06:23.000
- What do you mean?
- Prado gave up Marwan's location.

06:23.080 --> 06:25.680
I thought Prado claimed
he didn't know anything.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.480
He did.

06:27.560 --> 06:31.280
- He changed his mind.
- You mean Bauer physically coerced him.

06:31.360 --> 06:34.040
Tell me what happened, chapter and verse.

06:34.120 --> 06:39.000
Bauer got the information we needed. I think
it's best if I insulate you from the details.

06:39.080 --> 06:42.920
The president gave explicit orders.
You should have restrained Bauer.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.360
With all due respect, restraint is
a luxury we can't afford right now.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.360
What do I to tell the president?

06:49.440 --> 06:54.520
Convince him to sign off on the extreme
interrogation, and we'll cheat the timeline.

06:54.600 --> 06:59.280
I made the mistake of deceiving one
president. I won't make that mistake twice.

06:59.360 --> 07:01.800
Even though we both know Bauer was right?

07:03.720 --> 07:05.520
Mike.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.200
Someone out there
has one of our nuclear warheads.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.560
- "May I speak off the record?"
- Go ahead.

07:13.640 --> 07:15.800
I'm worried about President Logan.

07:15.880 --> 07:18.880
Worried? Why?

07:18.960 --> 07:22.160
His behaviour over the last few hours.

07:22.240 --> 07:27.920
I'm concerned about his ability
to lead us through this crisis.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.320
I understand.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.040
- Yes?
- " Where are you?"

08:02.120 --> 08:04.480
At the location.
We arrived with the package.

08:04.560 --> 08:08.480
- Has Sabir done the compatibility check?
- "Not yet."

08:08.560 --> 08:13.360
Call me as soon as he's finished, then I'll have
the next payment wired to your account.

08:26.800 --> 08:30.040
- Is it compatible?
- I'll need to reconfigure the mechanism.

08:30.120 --> 08:33.080
Is it compatible?

08:33.159 --> 08:34.480
Yes.

08:34.559 --> 08:37.600
- How long will that take?
- An hour, maybe less.

08:37.679 --> 08:41.159
Then you should start.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.840
- Girlfriend.
- She'll leave a message.

08:45.920 --> 08:49.640
She's already left three messages.
I don't want her calling around for me.

08:49.720 --> 08:52.480
Take the call, but hurry up.

08:53.560 --> 08:55.120
- Nabila?
- " Where are you?"

08:55.200 --> 08:57.840
- It's the middle of the night.
- I asked you where you are.

08:57.920 --> 09:00.240
- At the hotel.
- Stop lying to me. I called.

09:00.320 --> 09:03.200
You never checked in.
Tell me what you're doing.

09:03.280 --> 09:07.680
Nabila, I can't talk about this now. Get some
sleep and I'll explain everything tomorrow.

09:07.760 --> 09:10.640
After you've had time
to come up with another lie?

09:10.720 --> 09:13.480
I found something on your computer, Sabir.

09:13.560 --> 09:18.600
A bookmark. Do you have something
to do with what's been happening today?

09:18.680 --> 09:22.400
- "How can you ask that?"
- Are you working with these terrorists?

09:22.480 --> 09:26.000
Of course not!
You know I'm not a violent man.

09:26.080 --> 09:29.560
- I know your politics.
- Nabila, enough! Stop talking nonsense.

09:29.640 --> 09:32.880
- Is it nonsense?
- Like I said, I'll explain things tomorrow.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.760
Sabir, listen to me.

09:36.760 --> 09:39.760
She's fine. Don't worry.

09:42.320 --> 09:47.520
I want schematics on the nightclub,
options for a staging area, and traffic control.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.960
- Thank you.
- Bill. How could you let Jack torture Prado?

09:53.000 --> 09:54.800
Audrey, it had to be done.

09:54.880 --> 09:57.720
Logan made it clear
he didn't want Prado's rights violated.

09:57.800 --> 10:00.160
He did make it clear, and he was wrong.

10:00.240 --> 10:04.080
We can't break protocol because we think
it's right and expect to get away with it.

10:04.160 --> 10:08.160
Normally, I'd agree, but here I'd rather
ask for forgiveness than permission.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.960
- What kind of answer is that?
- The answer is, it worked.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.960
We got Marwan's location.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.200
Audrey.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.640
With all due respect,
this is not Washington, DC.

10:16.720 --> 10:20.920
Policy and politics do not always work
on the front line, where we are today.

10:21.000 --> 10:26.320
Yes, well, Charles Logan is a politician,
and he is not gonna give you forgiveness.

10:26.400 --> 10:30.200
I hope this does not come back
to haunt you or Jack.

10:30.280 --> 10:34.480
If what we did gets us to Marwan,
we'll live with it.

10:46.320 --> 10:48.120
What is it?

10:48.680 --> 10:51.400
CTU located Marwan.

10:51.480 --> 10:54.880
They sent a tactical team to grab him.

10:56.320 --> 10:58.320
That's good news.

11:00.440 --> 11:04.000
But I'm curious
how they obtained Marwan's location.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.040
Did they use force?

11:08.120 --> 11:10.680
Yes, sir, I believe force was used.

11:10.760 --> 11:14.840
I'm sure I don't need to remind you
this is an extremely time-sensitive situation.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.480
Who's responsible, Mike?

11:19.360 --> 11:21.760
I'm asking you a question, Mike.
Who did this?

11:24.200 --> 11:25.840
Jack Bauer.

11:27.200 --> 11:31.640
I'm the President of the United States. I can't
allow this insubordination to go unanswered,

11:31.720 --> 11:35.320
especially at a time of crisis!

11:37.800 --> 11:40.120
I want Bauer arrested.

11:40.880 --> 11:45.680
I agree that should happen, sir. But I think we
should wait until we have Marwan in custody.

11:45.760 --> 11:47.600
No.

11:47.680 --> 11:52.280
- I want him arrested now.
- Sir, Bauer is heading the field operation.

11:52.360 --> 11:55.680
Bauer is not the only man who can do the job!
Put someone else in charge!

11:55.760 --> 11:57.440
Mr President...

11:57.520 --> 12:01.680
- Get me Secret Service.
- " Yes, Mr President."

12:05.080 --> 12:08.640
- Has Jack set the robotic camera?
- " We're still a few minutes out.

12:08.720 --> 12:11.200
We're set to receive. Thanks, Curtis.

12:11.280 --> 12:14.120
Get this to Audrey Raines
and have her stream it to DOD.

12:16.840 --> 12:18.960
- Buchanan.
- Bill, it's Mike Novick.

12:19.040 --> 12:21.360
I just got out of a room with President Logan.

12:21.440 --> 12:24.360
He knows how we got
the information from Prado.

12:24.440 --> 12:27.360
- How did he find that out?
- He's not a stupid man, Bill.

12:27.440 --> 12:31.040
- I'm not gonna lie to him.
- You have to convince him to leave it alone.

12:31.120 --> 12:35.640
- I tried. He's not going to leave it alone.
- Tomorrow he can bring charges against me.

12:35.720 --> 12:37.800
I have to get back to the business
of finding Marwan.

12:37.880 --> 12:41.480
- It's not tomorrow and it's not you.
- "What does that mean?"

12:41.560 --> 12:44.600
- He wants Jack Bauer arrested.
- Arrested?

12:44.680 --> 12:45.880
Mike!

12:48.240 --> 12:50.720
Jack is heading up the team
that's bringing in Marwan.

12:50.800 --> 12:55.840
We're aware of that. Logan's adamant.
He wants this dealt with immediately.

12:55.920 --> 12:59.880
Anything less he will take as
a personal repudiation of his presidency.

12:59.960 --> 13:01.920
What's more important? His feelings

13:02.000 --> 13:04.800
or capturing the man
responsible for today's events?

13:04.880 --> 13:10.160
I hear what you're saying, Bill,
but Logan's already called the Secret Service.

13:10.240 --> 13:12.560
They're on their way
to take Jack into custody.

13:12.640 --> 13:16.080
I suggest you warn him immediately.

13:50.320 --> 13:53.320
Before moving,
we need confirmation Marwan's inside.

13:53.400 --> 13:57.400
- I'll send in the remote camera.
- All right.

13:59.520 --> 14:02.120
- What's your point of entry?
- Ventilation shaft.

14:02.200 --> 14:06.640
Chloe, can you get the schematics for the AC
configuration? Send it over to my PDA.

14:06.720 --> 14:10.160
I'm on it, Jack.
I'll send it to you as soon as I can.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.920
OK, the camera's working.

14:32.360 --> 14:34.360
O'Brian.

14:34.440 --> 14:37.360
We got an LA woman
reporting suspicious activities.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.200
First tier wants it kicked up to you.

14:39.280 --> 14:42.720
- Cross-referenced an ID match?
- "She seems to be who she says she is."

14:42.800 --> 14:45.360
Send her information to my screen.
Put her through.

14:45.440 --> 14:48.880
- "Here you go."
- This is Chloe O'Brian. How can I help you?

14:48.960 --> 14:53.280
I was just telling the man on the phone I'm
not sure who exactly I should be talking to.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.960
I'm an analyst at CTU Los Angeles.
Why don't you start at the beginning?

14:57.040 --> 14:59.920
- I'm calling about my boyfriend.
- What's his name?

15:00.000 --> 15:02.440
Please understand I'm not sure
if this means anything.

15:02.520 --> 15:04.840
You were about to tell me his name?

15:04.920 --> 15:08.240
Sabir Ardakani.
We've been going out since grad school.

15:08.320 --> 15:12.800
- Uh, can you spell that?
- Ardakani. A-r-d-a-k-a-n-i.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.800
- Where'd you go to grad school?
- "Berkeley Tech."

15:17.880 --> 15:21.080
We were both studying engineering.

15:21.160 --> 15:24.560
He's been travelling a lot lately.
Business trips, he said.

15:24.640 --> 15:28.560
I'm not sure why I looked - probably
because of everything that's gone on today -

15:28.640 --> 15:30.840
but I found something on his computer.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.240
Tell me.

15:33.240 --> 15:37.680
I think Sabir may have become involved
with radical groups.

15:37.760 --> 15:39.920
- You mean terrorists?
- "Yes."

15:40.920 --> 15:44.480
- Where's Sabir now?
- He said he was going to Arizona,

15:44.560 --> 15:46.240
but the hotel has no record of him.

15:46.320 --> 15:49.320
When you looked through his files,
tell me what you found.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.240
Most of his files were encrypted,
but there was one document

15:52.320 --> 15:58.120
that's a schematic for a microchip,
a type I've never seen before.

16:43.320 --> 16:45.840
- " Jack, do you copy?"
- Yeah.

16:45.920 --> 16:48.600
- Buchanan wants to talk to you.
- Now?

16:48.680 --> 16:50.800
He says it's urgent.

16:50.880 --> 16:52.920
Fine.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.680
- " Go ahead, Bill."
- Jack, we got a problem.

16:55.760 --> 16:59.880
- Secret Service is on their way to arrest you.
- What are you talking about?

16:59.960 --> 17:02.720
Logan knows we violated
his order about Prado.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.800
We can't interrupt this mission.
You gotta stall them.

17:05.880 --> 17:09.880
I've been on the phone for the last ten
minutes. There's nothing I can do from here.

17:09.960 --> 17:12.880
You have to get Marwan
before Secret Service gets there.

17:12.960 --> 17:16.240
- Curtis, did you copy that?
- Yeah. I'll run interference.

17:16.319 --> 17:19.200
Give me a couple of minutes.
I'll be ready to transmit.

17:19.280 --> 17:20.920
Jack, we're ready.

17:34.440 --> 17:37.120
Excuse me, Marwan.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.520
I just talked to Abad in New York.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.200
As soon as you're done, I'll upload the tape.

17:42.280 --> 17:46.680
Good. I want this delivered to television
stations by dawn on the east coast.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.880
It won't be a problem.

17:48.960 --> 17:52.440
- Do you wanna cover your face?
- No.

17:52.520 --> 17:56.400
I want the American people
to know who did this.

18:01.920 --> 18:03.960
Ready.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.360
People of America,

18:09.440 --> 18:12.600
you wake up today to a different world.

18:12.680 --> 18:17.080
One of your own nuclear weapons
has been used against you.

18:17.160 --> 18:22.200
It'll be days and weeks before you can
measure the damage we've caused,

18:22.280 --> 18:24.640
but as you count your dead,

18:24.720 --> 18:28.880
remember why this has happened to you.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.960
You have no understanding for the causes

18:31.040 --> 18:34.520
of the people you strike down
or the nations you conquer.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.640
You choose to meddle
in their affairs without respect.

18:37.720 --> 18:42.240
You follow your government unquestioning
toward your own slaughter.

18:42.320 --> 18:46.560
Today you pay the price for that ignorance.

19:26.480 --> 19:29.160
" The camera is in the vent.

19:37.080 --> 19:40.920
I've got a visual on the main room.
Approximately 50 civilians.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.480
Marwan won't be here.
He's gonna want to stay out of sight.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.560
Hold on, I've got a possible sentry.

19:48.600 --> 19:51.720
A second possible sentry at the window
looking at the street.

19:51.800 --> 19:54.920
- Hey, Michelle, can you get a frame grab?
- We're working on an ID.

19:55.000 --> 20:00.400
I'm sending a freeze-frame
to the facial recognition software.

20:08.640 --> 20:11.440
We have a match.
He's a known associate of Marwan.

20:11.520 --> 20:13.640
That confirms it's a legitimate address.

20:13.720 --> 20:18.280
But not that Marwan is there. We can't risk
exposing ourselves till we know he's in there.

20:18.600 --> 20:19.720
Castle.

20:19.800 --> 20:22.680
Secret Service
is approaching your position.

20:22.760 --> 20:25.040
" Jack, Secret Service has arrived.

20:25.120 --> 20:29.960
- Did Marwan's people see them approach?
- No, they came out through the rear alley.

20:33.840 --> 20:36.280
Moving over to the next room.

20:39.360 --> 20:44.080
Unless you renounce your policies
of imperialism and interventionist activities,

20:44.160 --> 20:48.840
this attack will be followed by another,
and another after that.

20:54.280 --> 20:57.680
" I got a visual on people,
what looks like a storage unit.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.680
- How many?
- " Five."

20:59.760 --> 21:04.160
But they're talking to someone else
out of my sightline.

21:04.240 --> 21:06.080
" All right, copy.

21:06.160 --> 21:08.280
Stand by, Jack. What's going on?

21:08.360 --> 21:11.280
Secret Service. I'm Agent Moorefield.
This is Agent Wells.

21:11.360 --> 21:16.160
We know this is a highly irregular situation.
We have orders to take Bauer into custody.

21:16.240 --> 21:18.760
Curtis, let me talk to them.

21:18.840 --> 21:21.360
- Go ahead, Jack.
- "This is Jack Bauer."

21:21.440 --> 21:24.560
We are trying to confirm
Habib Marwan is in this building.

21:24.640 --> 21:26.840
He is the terrorist who has a nuclear warhead.

21:26.920 --> 21:30.240
I cannot impress upon you
how sensitive this mission is.

21:30.320 --> 21:33.160
The president was specific.
We need to pull you off this now.

21:33.240 --> 21:35.560
I am in a concealed position.

21:35.640 --> 21:38.800
You pull me out now,
you put this whole operation in jeopardy.

21:38.880 --> 21:42.600
As soon as this is over I give you my word,
I will go with you.

21:42.680 --> 21:45.960
I'm sorry. If you don't come out,
we'll have to come in and get you.

21:46.040 --> 21:50.040
Secret Service Command has confirmed
the order. There's nothing I can do about it.

21:50.120 --> 21:53.600
We don't have a choice.
We're gonna need to replace you.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.800
Jack, this is Castle. I'm heading out to you.

21:55.880 --> 21:58.800
- " Approach the south of the building."
- " Got it.

22:01.960 --> 22:04.960
- We're on the move.
- All right. Careful.

22:21.600 --> 22:25.080
Marwan, the police are here.
Yasir saw an officer outside.

22:26.760 --> 22:28.760
Start packing.

22:36.160 --> 22:41.320
Hold on. I got a visual on Marwan. I have
a visual on Marwan. He is in the building.

22:50.360 --> 22:55.760
- They know we're here. Move on the building.
- Our cover's blown. Everyone, go, go, go, go!

23:30.440 --> 23:34.840
Get down! Everybody, get down!
Get down now! Get down!

23:54.440 --> 23:56.480
- " Outta the way!
- Freeze!

24:01.200 --> 24:03.280
I got him, Jack.

24:05.040 --> 24:07.840
Marwan's men have escaped
through a hole in the wall.

24:07.920 --> 24:11.240
Set up a two-mile perimeter.
Cover all utility access points.

24:14.960 --> 24:17.400
" Bomb! Bomb!

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
Jack, what happened? Curtis!

24:23.240 --> 24:24.680
Curtis!

24:25.240 --> 24:29.680
- " Jack, are you OK?
- Yeah. Check out the men.

24:31.760 --> 24:34.000
Michelle, it's Jack. We can't pursue.

24:34.080 --> 24:37.440
They blew the tunnel up behind them.
It's completely blocked.

24:37.520 --> 24:42.000
Have LAPD tighten up the perimeter. Get
'em to tell us what this tunnel feeds into now.

24:44.760 --> 24:46.280
Jack.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.680
Agent Bauer.
Agent Moorefield, Secret Service.

24:50.760 --> 24:56.760
I'm sorry, but I'm here to take you into
custody. Hand over your weapon, please.

24:59.880 --> 25:05.000
- You blew this mission.
- I'm sorry, sir. I'm just following orders.

25:24.760 --> 25:28.040
Has anyone asked President Logan
what the hell he was thinking?

25:28.120 --> 25:31.880
Curtis, we still have to focus on finding
Marwan. We pulled up city records.

25:31.960 --> 25:34.680
The building is directly adjacent
to a sewer line.

25:34.760 --> 25:37.040
- How many ingress points are there?
- 30.

25:37.120 --> 25:40.520
- Marwan's probably passed our perimeters.
- We have to keep looking.

25:40.600 --> 25:44.560
LAPD and FBI will set down a grid there.
Coordinate your men with them.

25:44.640 --> 25:46.720
We found a video tape on a man we shot.

25:46.800 --> 25:49.080
We should be able to recover
most of what's on it.

25:49.160 --> 25:52.960
Have one of your men come back with it.
Edgar's repositioned the satellite.

25:53.040 --> 25:56.640
- We'll let you know if we find anything.
- You got it.

25:59.120 --> 26:00.920
How did Marwan get past your men?

26:01.000 --> 26:04.840
- They had to move in before they were ready.
- "Why?"

26:04.920 --> 26:10.920
Secret Service showed up to take Bauer,
which compromised one of our positions.

26:13.320 --> 26:15.320
I didn't mean...

26:17.880 --> 26:20.760
That's not what I meant to have happen.

26:20.840 --> 26:23.480
With respect, sir,

26:23.560 --> 26:27.120
your orders were explicit.

26:27.200 --> 26:30.120
What other search protocols are you running?

26:30.200 --> 26:32.320
None. We're essentially without a lead.

26:36.840 --> 26:40.680
Bill, give us a few minutes.
We'll get right back to you.

26:40.760 --> 26:42.680
Standing by.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.960
This is not my fault.

26:52.040 --> 26:56.160
None of this would have happened
if Jack Bauer hadn't disobeyed my orders!

26:56.240 --> 27:00.600
I'm sorry, sir, but if you're asking me
to agree with that assessment, I can't.

27:04.200 --> 27:08.800
If it wasn't for Jack,
we wouldn't have located Marwan.

27:13.400 --> 27:18.240
CTU is waiting for us
to call them back with a directive.

27:18.320 --> 27:22.440
What would you like me to tell them,
Mr President?

27:29.160 --> 27:31.320
I have no idea.

27:34.240 --> 27:37.600
And that's the problem, isn't it?

27:38.360 --> 27:41.760
It is my fault we lost him.

27:41.840 --> 27:45.880
This man, Marwan, has a nuclear warhead
and I allowed him to escape.

27:45.960 --> 27:48.280
- Mr President...
- Stop.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.880
I don't even know
if I deserve to be called that.

27:53.520 --> 27:58.800
Whatever I call you won't change the fact
you are President of the United States.

27:58.880 --> 28:01.720
I shouldn't be.

28:01.800 --> 28:05.960
- For the good of this country, I should resign.
- That's not an option, sir.

28:06.040 --> 28:11.120
Not without destroying the public's
confidence, which is already at its limits.

28:13.120 --> 28:17.480
Three presidents in as many hours
would be devastating.

28:20.160 --> 28:22.160
Then what should I do, Mike?

28:25.160 --> 28:27.160
Tell me what to do.

28:32.960 --> 28:37.400
There's someone who can
advise you better than I can.

28:39.160 --> 28:44.600
You should consider bringing him in here
to help you through this.

28:47.040 --> 28:48.440
Who?

28:48.760 --> 28:50.280
Keeler is in critical condition

28:50.360 --> 28:53.680
"after Air Force One crashed a few hours ago."

28:53.760 --> 28:58.440
A White House spokesperson reports
the president was taken to a military hospital

28:58.520 --> 29:00.600
following the crash.

29:00.680 --> 29:04.400
Sir, there's a secure call
coming through for you.

29:05.480 --> 29:07.480
Thank you, Alex.

29:09.600 --> 29:12.600
- Hello?
- " Mr President."

29:12.680 --> 29:15.160
- Mike?
- Yes, sir.

29:15.240 --> 29:17.600
I'm sorry to disturb you so late.

29:17.680 --> 29:22.040
No, I've been up all night following the news.
This is a tragic day for our country.

29:22.120 --> 29:23.120
Yes.

29:23.200 --> 29:26.800
May I ask when you received
your last intelligence briefing?

29:26.880 --> 29:30.440
- Three hours ago. Why?
- The terrorist behind today's events,

29:30.520 --> 29:33.960
Habib Marwan,
has taken possession of a nuclear warhead.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.120
Oh, my God.

29:36.200 --> 29:37.360
How?

29:37.440 --> 29:41.320
Well, he recovered the football
from the wreckage of Air Force One

29:41.400 --> 29:45.440
and he used it to track and steal a warhead.

29:45.520 --> 29:49.480
- President Logan feels he needs help.
- What kind of help?

29:49.560 --> 29:53.480
- "Substantial."
- I'm not sure what you're asking me to do.

29:53.560 --> 29:58.360
President Logan is requesting you run
the effort to recover the stolen weapon

29:58.440 --> 30:01.640
and be in place to make
whatever decisions need to be made.

30:01.720 --> 30:04.440
A crisis is looming.

30:04.520 --> 30:07.840
Hard choices may need to be made.

30:07.920 --> 30:11.520
And by the president's own admission,

30:11.600 --> 30:14.360
he feels he may not be up to the task.

30:15.400 --> 30:22.040
This country is very possibly about to face
the worst terrorist act in its history.

30:23.040 --> 30:25.680
We need your leadership.

30:27.160 --> 30:31.960
Before I do anything, I wanna speak
to President Logan face to face.

30:32.040 --> 30:37.120
Fair enough. I'll notify your Secret Service
detail to bring you to the White House.

30:37.200 --> 30:39.640
All right, Mike.

30:39.720 --> 30:41.720
Thank you, Mr President.

30:56.480 --> 31:00.520
Secret Service rescinded the order.
Yeah, they're releasing Jack now.

31:00.600 --> 31:02.080
All right.

31:02.160 --> 31:03.640
Yeah.

31:06.280 --> 31:09.280
Please step out of the car, Agent Bauer.

31:10.440 --> 31:12.600
What's going on?

31:12.680 --> 31:17.480
President Logan realised this was a mistake.
You're free to go.

31:20.520 --> 31:22.960
I am genuinely sorry about all this.

31:23.040 --> 31:29.040
Doesn't really help us with our situation,
does it? We had Marwan. Any sign of him?

31:29.120 --> 31:32.080
We have people all over the tunnels.
So far, nothing.

31:33.200 --> 31:37.320
- We had him. Dammit, we had him!
- They're not finished searching the tunnels.

31:37.400 --> 31:40.840
If you haven't found him yet, you're not
going to. Too many ways in and out.

31:40.920 --> 31:43.240
CTU have any new leads
on Marwan or the warhead?

31:43.320 --> 31:45.160
- No.
- Great.

31:45.560 --> 31:48.200
Load everybody up.
We're going back to CTU now.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.520
All right, everyone, let's go!

31:53.120 --> 31:54.800
- Edgar.
- I'm busy.

31:54.880 --> 31:58.200
Release your system.
It's the only one with the random sequencer.

31:58.280 --> 32:00.960
- You'll have to wait.
- Someone called a lead in.

32:01.040 --> 32:03.280
I need to pursue this.

32:03.360 --> 32:07.520
I have agents out there looking for Marwan.
I need to reconfigure the perimeter.

32:07.600 --> 32:11.720
You don't need your system to do that.
They can just use the profiles on their panels.

32:11.800 --> 32:13.600
Things are changing every minute.

32:13.680 --> 32:16.720
They're field agents.
They don't need you to coddle them.

32:16.800 --> 32:19.640
You know, that's a pretty rude attitude.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.480
- I need your system.
- No.

32:24.200 --> 32:26.760
- Tony.
- What?

32:26.840 --> 32:30.520
A woman thinks her boyfriend may have
something to do with today's attacks.

32:30.600 --> 32:34.360
- Did you verify it?
- No. I need to use Edgar's system.

32:34.440 --> 32:36.280
- Why?
- Her evidence involves data

32:36.360 --> 32:40.000
that she got from her boyfriend's computer.
It's in preparatory format.

32:40.080 --> 32:44.720
- What's Edgar doing?
- Moving agents Jack and Curtis don't need.

32:44.800 --> 32:46.720
- Edgar!
- Yeah?

32:46.800 --> 32:50.720
- Let Chloe into your system.
- What about tactical? I got guys out there.

32:50.800 --> 32:53.960
Marwan's long gone.
Most of those agents you can call back in.

32:54.040 --> 32:56.040
" Excuse me.

33:33.240 --> 33:35.240
" All right.

33:39.560 --> 33:42.840
" Yes?

33:42.920 --> 33:45.320
This is Morrison. Is there a problem?

33:45.400 --> 33:48.480
- CTU found the club.
- How'd they know you were there?

33:48.560 --> 33:52.440
Must have been Prado.
Has the warhead been reconfigured?

33:52.520 --> 33:53.880
Yes.

33:53.960 --> 33:56.760
Then our timetable remains unchanged.

33:56.840 --> 33:58.960
Marwan.

33:59.040 --> 34:03.400
- We may have a potential security breach.
- Who?

34:03.480 --> 34:07.400
The technician, Sabir.
His girlfriend's getting suspicious.

34:07.480 --> 34:11.120
- But it's being taken care of?
- Of course. It's being handled.

34:11.199 --> 34:14.480
Let me know when it's done.

34:25.600 --> 34:26.800
- Tony.
- Yeah?

34:26.880 --> 34:29.920
The woman who was suspicious
about her boyfriend panned out.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.600
- What'd you find?
- She sent us a schematic of a microchip.

34:33.679 --> 34:36.440
It's used exclusively
in legacy nuclear warheads.

34:36.520 --> 34:38.600
Including the one Marwan has control of?

34:38.679 --> 34:44.320
Yes. This is the design of the chip that
controls the trigger on the stolen warhead.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.400
What do we know about the boyfriend?

34:46.480 --> 34:50.560
His name's Sabir Ardakani. According
to his girlfriend, he's become radicalised.

34:50.639 --> 34:54.040
I want his ID on an all-agency
distribution list, highest priority.

34:54.120 --> 34:56.120
She thinks he's out of state.

34:56.199 --> 34:59.280
He's probably somewhere
in the lowa region with the warhead.

34:59.360 --> 35:01.800
- Is this woman who gave you the tip local?
- Yes.

35:01.880 --> 35:06.200
The rest of the files on his hard drive
are locked. We're gonna need a specialist.

35:06.280 --> 35:09.400
We're gonna need to send a team
over there as soon as possible.

35:09.480 --> 35:13.240
- All right. Chloe, I want you over there.
- What?

35:13.320 --> 35:17.000
- Take a team with you. Let's go.
- I'm not a field agent. I don't do that.

35:17.080 --> 35:18.400
Chloe.

35:18.480 --> 35:23.000
We need a specialist. You're the only one
who can get those files off that hard drive.

35:23.080 --> 35:27.160
I wanna know what Ardakani is doing
and where he is.

35:28.080 --> 35:31.240
Chloe, I'm giving you an order. Go.

35:47.440 --> 35:51.480
Edgar, it's Chloe. Does my panel have
a live link to the tactical network?

35:51.560 --> 35:53.560
- "Not yet."
- What are you waiting for?

35:53.640 --> 35:56.720
- We don't do that until the agent's on site.
- I'm not an agent.

35:56.800 --> 35:59.360
I know that,
but you're attached to a mobile unit.

35:59.440 --> 36:02.080
I'm doing things by the book
like you always tell me to.

36:02.160 --> 36:06.800
I'm just not comfortable out here. I wanna
make sure you have everything covered.

36:07.480 --> 36:11.560
- You have your live link. What else?
- Trunk my audio in with Bergin and White.

36:11.640 --> 36:14.640
I wanna make sure I can monitor
a two-way between them and CTU.

36:14.720 --> 36:16.520
Done.

36:16.600 --> 36:20.640
OK. I can't think of anything else right now,
but if I do, I'm gonna call you,

36:20.720 --> 36:24.240
and I really hope you don't give me
so much resistance next time.

36:24.320 --> 36:28.600
Chloe, I know you're scared, and I'll make
sure everything is covered on this end.

36:28.680 --> 36:32.160
Why did they ask me to do this?
I really hate it.

36:32.240 --> 36:36.680
While you were prepping,
I asked Buchanan if I can go instead of you.

36:36.760 --> 36:41.800
He wouldn't let me.
He said you were the best analyst we have.

36:41.880 --> 36:43.920
He's right.

36:44.960 --> 36:48.560
I know. I'll call you
if I can think of anything else.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.640
OK.

37:16.800 --> 37:20.800
Hi. I'm Agent O'Brian. These are Agents
Bergin and White. You're Nabila Argamila?

37:20.880 --> 37:23.880
- Where's the computer?
- Please come in.

37:26.240 --> 37:29.920
Did Mr Ardakani keep records
other than on his computer?

37:30.000 --> 37:33.840
- There are some papers in the bedroom.
- This is the computer?

37:33.920 --> 37:36.880
Yes, but like I told you,
the rest of his files are encrypted.

37:36.960 --> 37:40.440
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I ran a check to confirm.

37:41.160 --> 37:44.360
I have a doctorate in computer sciences.

37:44.440 --> 37:48.240
OK, let's see. You're right.
They used Blowfish algorithm.

37:48.320 --> 37:50.880
- How can you tell?
- By the tab on the file headers.

37:50.960 --> 37:53.720
- Can you decrypt it?
- CTU has a proprietary algorithm.

37:53.800 --> 37:58.600
It shouldn't take long. We'll start by trying to
hack the password. Let's start with the basics.

37:58.680 --> 38:01.680
Write down nicknames, pets,
anything he might have used.

38:01.760 --> 38:03.040
OK.

38:03.120 --> 38:05.400
- What was that?
- I don't know.

38:06.720 --> 38:09.040
Go! Go!

38:11.840 --> 38:13.280
In here!

38:22.480 --> 38:25.160
Your men are dead. Open the door!

38:25.240 --> 38:28.200
- " God. Don't you have a gun?
- I work with computers.

38:28.280 --> 38:29.880
- " Open the door!
- Stiles.

38:29.960 --> 38:32.640
- It's Chloe. We're being shot at!
- Where are you?

38:32.720 --> 38:35.040
- " Open the door!
- Las Vilas. We need help.

38:35.120 --> 38:37.120
OK, all right.

38:37.760 --> 38:40.360
- Jack, Chloe's under fire.
- What's her location?

38:40.440 --> 38:44.040
- 1482 Franklin, Las Vilas.
- How far out are the closest tac teams?

38:44.120 --> 38:47.160
- I'm on it.
- Chloe, it's Jack. What's your situation?

38:47.240 --> 38:49.840
- Barricaded in the laundry room.
- Who are you with?

38:49.920 --> 38:54.240
Our informant. Bergin and White were here.
Bergin's down. I don't know where White is.

38:54.320 --> 38:57.000
- I'll call you back.
- Chloe, don't hang up the phone.

38:57.080 --> 38:59.920
Get her back on the line now.

39:02.880 --> 39:04.520
Hurry.

39:11.120 --> 39:14.440
This is Jack Bauer.
I need an LAPD response at 1482 Franklin.

39:14.520 --> 39:18.240
We have two agents down, one under fire.
Where are the tac teams?

39:18.320 --> 39:20.960
- " About 15 minutes.
- It's too long.

39:23.800 --> 39:26.920
We open the door... We open...

39:27.920 --> 39:29.960
Where are the keys?

39:30.040 --> 39:32.640
Where are the keys?
Where are the keys?

39:40.080 --> 39:42.440
- Jack, it's her!
- Put her on speaker.

39:42.520 --> 39:45.200
- " How far away is help?"
- At least ten minutes.

39:45.280 --> 39:48.000
- Ten minutes is too long!
- Just try to stay calm.

39:48.080 --> 39:50.560
Tell me where you are now.

39:51.120 --> 39:55.040
- He's shooting at us! The glass is bulletproof.
- "Tell me where you are."

39:55.120 --> 39:58.080
In the CTU car.
He's shooting at us from outside.

39:58.160 --> 40:00.640
I don't have the keys. Can I hot-wire this?

40:00.720 --> 40:04.040
No, it's secure. There should be
weapons stored inside the vehicle.

40:04.120 --> 40:07.760
There's a rifle in the back.
It's locked. I need the combination.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.960
I'm on it.

40:18.520 --> 40:20.840
He's going.

40:20.920 --> 40:23.920
- Where's he going?
- Wait. I think he's leaving.

40:33.920 --> 40:36.960
- " Have we got the combination?
- Not yet.

40:41.040 --> 40:43.720
He's gonna ram us!

40:50.760 --> 40:52.920
What's taking so long, Jack?

40:58.040 --> 41:00.520
Got it. It's 3-1-4-3.

41:00.600 --> 41:02.600
- " Did you get that?"
- 3-1...

41:02.680 --> 41:05.400
What's going on here?
What are you doing?

41:07.120 --> 41:09.600
Go! Get out! Get out! Get out!

41:56.000 --> 41:59.080
