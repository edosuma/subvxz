[eclectic orchestral theme plays]

02:14.669 --> 02:18.506
[sings softly in Icelandic,
voice echoing]

02:45.075 --> 02:48.536
[singing softly]

02:59.923 --> 03:03.176
[woman sings along in Icelandic]

03:21.527 --> 03:24.156
I remember the first time
you sang with me.

03:25.157 --> 03:29.035
I don't know why we sing
such terrible things of children.

03:30.703 --> 03:33.999
Maybe we try to warn them
of what's to come.

03:36.209 --> 03:38.378
You're not one of
the Hidden People, are you?

03:40.421 --> 03:43.091
If you mean an elf, no.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.311
You're like me.

03:54.394 --> 03:56.021
[softly] Sensate.

03:57.230 --> 03:58.690
Do you live here, in Iceland?

03:59.440 --> 04:00.441
I do.

04:01.734 --> 04:02.944
Sit down.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.002
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

04:21.254 --> 04:23.882
- [pouring tea]
- I needed you to believe me.

04:25.300 --> 04:29.012
I needed you to believe...
that you weren't safe here,

04:29.095 --> 04:30.471
because you're not.

04:34.684 --> 04:36.477
[Lito] There were two worlds.

04:37.437 --> 04:41.691
I was living in...
in two separate worlds.

04:45.111 --> 04:46.571
Then...

04:47.822 --> 04:52.952
And then somehow they crashed...
into one another.

04:53.036 --> 04:54.871
[mimics explosion]

04:57.040 --> 04:58.750
And now everything is dead.

05:03.963 --> 05:04.839
Another.

05:07.633 --> 05:10.262
So are we celebrating or mourning?

05:17.227 --> 05:19.145
[sighs softly]

05:19.229 --> 05:20.897
I'm celebrating.

05:23.608 --> 05:24.692
I know how you feel.

05:28.613 --> 05:29.489
You do?

05:31.783 --> 05:35.412
I mean... I don't know
what it's like to be famous, but...

05:36.413 --> 05:38.706
I know what it's like living two lives.

05:43.586 --> 05:45.004
Do you know who I am?

05:46.339 --> 05:47.757
You're an actor, right?

05:51.094 --> 05:52.845
- Yeah.
- I knew it.

05:54.013 --> 05:56.349
I saw you in that telenovela
where you had an evil twin

05:56.433 --> 05:58.851
that was trying
to take over your life, right?

06:00.561 --> 06:02.230
The Mirror Has No Heart.

06:02.314 --> 06:04.690
[chuckles] That's it.

06:04.774 --> 06:07.860
You were good in it and... bad.

06:10.071 --> 06:12.782
But... that's what this is about,
isn't it?

06:13.866 --> 06:15.994
The movie said something true
about all of us,

06:16.077 --> 06:20.748
that we all have this... other nature,
this... secret self

06:20.832 --> 06:25.462
that is capable of really beautiful
and really terrible things.

06:30.049 --> 06:32.969
I, too, have a secret self.

06:35.096 --> 06:36.306
And right now...

06:37.015 --> 06:40.101
it really wants to take you
to that bathroom over there

06:40.185 --> 06:45.648
and do some...
beautiful and terrible things to you.

06:48.860 --> 06:50.111
What are you doing?

06:52.905 --> 06:55.283
How can you possibly
think that I could be like that?

07:01.206 --> 07:02.790
I'm not a faggot.

07:06.127 --> 07:11.132
The Biologic Preservation Organization
funds projects like the DNA census

07:11.216 --> 07:15.094
in order to track and hunt down
any potential sensate.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.680
Do you work for them?

07:17.763 --> 07:21.393
I try to save the ones I can
before they're discovered.

07:22.477 --> 07:24.187
Your mother brought you in

07:24.270 --> 07:28.024
to see if you have the genes
for the same disease that was killing her.

07:28.107 --> 07:32.820
And fortunately, I saw the report on you
before anyone else did.

07:34.864 --> 07:37.325
You told a child she was hexed.

07:40.161 --> 07:45.041
You made me believe that...
I caused my mother's death.

07:45.124 --> 07:48.503
I'm sorry if I caused you
unnecessary pain.

07:50.046 --> 07:54.384
Because of you, I believed that what
happened in the mountains was my fault.

07:56.219 --> 07:58.513
My intention was to protect you.

08:05.728 --> 08:07.230
You have children?

08:11.025 --> 08:13.278
- Never wanted them.
- Why?

08:15.029 --> 08:17.532
Afraid they would be like me.

08:17.616 --> 08:22.954
Afraid they would be hunted...
that I would have to feel them die.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.010
[sighs]

09:21.887 --> 09:23.014
[whispers] Don't look at him.

09:24.098 --> 09:26.058
[whispers] That's how he got me.

09:27.185 --> 09:28.353
He knows you're here.

09:28.436 --> 09:29.854
Run!

09:33.399 --> 09:36.361
- [man] Look at me! Look at me!
- [gasps]

09:36.444 --> 09:39.030
[young Will grunting]

09:39.113 --> 09:40.406
[gasps]

09:40.490 --> 09:42.742
[panting]

09:44.243 --> 09:45.704
[exhales] Shit.

10:01.761 --> 10:02.970
[bottle rattles]

10:04.389 --> 10:05.973
[bottle opener clinks]

10:09.060 --> 10:10.770
[gasps]

10:13.314 --> 10:14.733
Hello, Will.

10:16.942 --> 10:18.903
[softly] You knew what was happening.

10:22.323 --> 10:24.659
Why didn't you help me?

10:24.743 --> 10:27.495
I took terrible chances to protect you.

10:28.496 --> 10:29.955
I felt your pain.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.291
I lived it.

10:33.959 --> 10:35.670
I called the rescue authorities.

10:35.754 --> 10:38.256
If I hadn't gotten involved,
you'd be dead.

10:40.883 --> 10:42.510
[no audio]

10:44.262 --> 10:46.305
That's what I wanted.

10:48.516 --> 10:50.017
To be dead.

10:51.811 --> 10:53.772
To be with them.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.273
I know.

10:58.693 --> 11:02.739
When we lost one of our cluster,
I thought the pain would destroy me.

11:04.616 --> 11:06.701
But life holds onto you.

11:08.202 --> 11:12.624
And sometimes, it finds a way
to push back into your heart.

11:12.707 --> 11:17.211
And if you're lucky...
it gives us another chance.

11:18.296 --> 11:20.965
And what if you
don't want another chance?

11:21.048 --> 11:25.094
If you didn't,
you wouldn't have come looking for me.

11:26.596 --> 11:28.222
I wasn't sure I'd be able to find you.

11:28.306 --> 11:30.057
Where are you?

11:30.141 --> 11:31.684
I don't know.

11:36.731 --> 11:38.524
Not the poshest place I've been...

11:39.484 --> 11:41.026
but not the worst either.

11:41.902 --> 11:45.197
- What are they doing to you?
- Watching, measuring.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.242
Those cameras are recording this,

11:48.326 --> 11:50.953
so if I want to say anything
I don't want them to hear...

11:51.746 --> 11:53.331
I have to come to you.

11:54.666 --> 11:57.752
If you visit,
you speak as a voice in my head.

11:58.544 --> 12:01.506
But if I speak without visiting,
it looks like I'm talking to myself.

12:01.589 --> 12:03.215
I figured that out the hard way.

12:04.342 --> 12:05.468
We have to get you outta there.

12:05.551 --> 12:08.805
I've been unconscious for so long,
I could be anywhere.

12:10.765 --> 12:12.224
Don't worry about me.

12:13.058 --> 12:14.853
Right now, I have value to them.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.145
I'm sorry.

12:16.979 --> 12:18.773
This is all my fault.

12:19.899 --> 12:22.234
Angelica didn't believe in fault.

12:23.444 --> 12:27.114
She said it was the present
understood by people looking backward.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.951
We have to look forward.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.205
If we don't, we won't survive.

12:37.750 --> 12:42.922
And now that you know the truth...
it's time for me to go.

12:44.298 --> 12:47.301
- Why?
- Because you came back.

12:48.344 --> 12:51.681
And if they find you,
you're going to lead them straight to me.

12:59.188 --> 13:00.356
No, I won't.

13:01.315 --> 13:02.567
Accidents happen.

13:03.359 --> 13:05.653
You know that more than most.

13:05.737 --> 13:07.697
But I'll be careful.

13:07.780 --> 13:10.324
I've seen it happen so many times.

13:10.408 --> 13:13.285
One simple slip, then a hospital,

13:13.369 --> 13:17.289
and before you even understand
the consequences, you will be arrested.

13:17.373 --> 13:19.417
I won't tell anyone about you.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.502
You won't have a choice.

13:22.670 --> 13:27.592
They have ways...
techniques of tracing the psycellium.

13:28.342 --> 13:29.468
Psycellium?

13:29.552 --> 13:33.055
It's kind of a psychic nervous system.

13:33.138 --> 13:34.390
It connects us...

13:36.141 --> 13:40.312
allows you to be here with me...
or your cluster.

13:40.396 --> 13:43.942
If you listen closely to it,
you can hear it vibrating.

13:45.359 --> 13:46.277
Here.

13:47.152 --> 13:50.114
Listen with this, not with the mind.

13:52.992 --> 13:55.578
Follow where the feeling takes you.

13:56.746 --> 13:58.915
I know all about BPO.

13:58.998 --> 14:01.918
I know how they're funded,
how they spend their money...

14:03.294 --> 14:05.504
- This is just a start.
- You work fast.

14:07.131 --> 14:08.466
I will find you.

14:08.549 --> 14:10.384
There are more important things than me.

14:16.181 --> 14:17.182
Riley.

14:17.976 --> 14:19.435
The girl from Iceland.

14:20.770 --> 14:23.689
- Who are you talking to?
- Jonas.

14:23.773 --> 14:25.858
- You found him?
- He found me.

14:28.444 --> 14:29.612
Is she with someone?

14:31.155 --> 14:31.990
Are you alone?

14:34.951 --> 14:36.869
Her name is Yrsa.

14:38.830 --> 14:40.289
She's like us.

14:40.372 --> 14:42.374
You like this girl, don't you?

14:45.419 --> 14:48.255
You feel very connected to this boy.

14:48.339 --> 14:50.132
[Jonas] I remember
what it was like to first share

14:50.215 --> 14:52.802
someone's every thought and emotion.

14:54.846 --> 14:56.597
This is very dangerous.

14:56.681 --> 15:00.142
I was in love with Angelica
from the moment our eyes touched.

15:01.727 --> 15:05.481
Love inside a cluster is pathological.

15:05.564 --> 15:07.149
Are you all right?

15:08.233 --> 15:09.902
[softly] Sometimes.

15:09.986 --> 15:14.198
Angelica believed a sensate
experiences love in its purest form.

15:15.491 --> 15:16.617
Are you all right?

15:19.244 --> 15:20.412
[whispers] Sometimes.

15:21.246 --> 15:22.957
Ask when he was born.

15:23.875 --> 15:25.209
What?

15:25.292 --> 15:27.045
His first birth, ask him.

15:27.879 --> 15:30.048
She wants to know
when your birthday is.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.674
August 8th.

15:34.552 --> 15:36.762
- What?
- [exhales]

15:37.722 --> 15:39.098
[whispers] That's my birthday.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.060
A cluster is always born
on the same day?

15:42.142 --> 15:45.270
However far across the world
a cluster is scattered,

15:45.354 --> 15:47.773
the first breath they take,
they take as one.

15:47.857 --> 15:51.694
Love inside a cluster
is the worst kind of narcissism.

15:53.029 --> 15:54.154
What?

15:55.197 --> 15:57.241
I have to go.

15:58.450 --> 16:01.662
- I hope you can help Jonas.
- Jonas?

16:01.746 --> 16:03.247
Is that Jonas Maliki?

16:04.082 --> 16:07.251
- What's Jonas' last name?
- Maliki.

16:09.628 --> 16:10.755
Get away from there!

16:12.423 --> 16:13.799
She's gone.

16:17.469 --> 16:19.471
Don't let her stay in Iceland.

16:19.555 --> 16:23.059
A lot of genetic research
funded by BPO is done there.

16:23.142 --> 16:24.685
They have a research facility.

16:25.603 --> 16:27.646
Many of us have gone there
and never come out.

16:27.730 --> 16:30.566
You keep using "us" and "them."
Who are we?

16:31.734 --> 16:34.278
Who we are is less relevant
than what we are,

16:34.361 --> 16:36.739
and what we are is different from them.

16:36.822 --> 16:38.783
I know who birthed you.

16:38.866 --> 16:40.743
Angelica Turing.

16:41.869 --> 16:45.081
Don't you ever be in touch
with that bastard again.

16:45.957 --> 16:47.166
Why?

16:47.249 --> 16:51.045
He and that bitch were collaborators.

16:52.004 --> 16:54.339
They hunted our kind for BPO.

16:54.423 --> 16:56.425
They worked with Whispers.

16:56.508 --> 17:01.305
They would give birth to clusters
and use them to find others.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.307
But he tried to help us.

17:04.058 --> 17:05.893
And now you trust him.

17:07.478 --> 17:10.856
If your boy is connected to Jonas,

17:10.940 --> 17:13.692
it won't be long
till Whispers will find you.

17:16.320 --> 17:17.780
You're on your own.

17:21.033 --> 17:23.243
[man in movie] My child.

17:23.327 --> 17:26.497
Who now is your father,
if it is not me?

17:26.580 --> 17:28.290
What are you doing here?

17:28.373 --> 17:30.960
You and this dummkopf
are like my own boys.

17:32.128 --> 17:33.629
We are family.

17:34.505 --> 17:35.589
How is he?

17:37.591 --> 17:40.011
The doctor said he should be dead.

17:41.095 --> 17:42.221
Good man.

17:43.222 --> 17:45.724
Never listen to doctors.
All they know is death.

17:45.808 --> 17:47.351
Life is a mystery to them.

17:49.353 --> 17:51.105
But we understand life, don't we?

17:51.772 --> 17:53.191
Life is simple.

17:53.273 --> 17:54.817
Life is just five things:

17:55.901 --> 18:01.740
eating, drinking, shitting, fucking,
and fighting for more, right?

18:02.658 --> 18:04.326
[chuckles]

18:04.409 --> 18:07.705
When we were boys,
your father would say that to me,

18:07.788 --> 18:11.834
and then he would punch me
as hard as he could. [chuckles]

18:13.627 --> 18:18.007
After he was killed,
I realized this was bullshit.

18:20.176 --> 18:23.846
At that moment,
all I wanted from life was one thing.

18:23.929 --> 18:26.473
Not five, no, no, just one.

18:27.599 --> 18:29.101
Revenge.

18:31.562 --> 18:34.648
I wanted the man who killed him.

18:35.691 --> 18:39.945
And for that one thing...
I would have given all the rest.

18:46.451 --> 18:48.913
My blood is in your veins, Wolfgang.

18:50.122 --> 18:51.957
I'm sympathetic.

18:53.000 --> 18:58.672
But please, tell me you are smart enough
to know that this was a mistake.

18:58.756 --> 19:01.508
Tell me that you understand
this can go no further.

19:13.104 --> 19:14.438
I love you, Wolfgang.

19:15.522 --> 19:20.111
But please... don't make me
choose between you and my son.

19:21.612 --> 19:23.363
[door opens]

19:26.658 --> 19:27.743
[door closes]

19:27.826 --> 19:29.954
[policeman 1]
So the assassins came out of nowhere?

19:30.037 --> 19:31.830
Yes.

19:31.914 --> 19:34.083
And you did not see any of their faces?

19:34.166 --> 19:35.709
She told you that.

19:36.752 --> 19:38.712
We're just trying
to get the facts straight, sir.

19:38.796 --> 19:41.423
While you're harassing my fiancée,
those killers are still out there.

19:41.506 --> 19:43.425
[policeman 2]
Miss Dandekar is our best witness.

19:43.508 --> 19:45.552
So you said you and Mr. Rasal
were talking?

19:45.636 --> 19:46.887
What did he want to talk about?

19:48.973 --> 19:50.308
A personal matter.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.101
Did you discuss religion?

19:52.977 --> 19:55.187
[policeman 1] Did you know
that Mr. Rasal had sponsored a bill

19:55.271 --> 19:57.564
that would make
certain religious practices illegal?

19:57.648 --> 20:00.901
Everyone knew how my father
felt about religion.

20:00.985 --> 20:03.570
Several witnesses testified
that they've seen you

20:03.654 --> 20:06.615
- pledging your weight in bananas?
- Is that true?

20:06.698 --> 20:09.327
Yes. Yes, it is.

20:09.409 --> 20:12.663
Did you know that act would be illegal
if Mr. Rasal's bill had passed?

20:12.746 --> 20:14.165
No.

20:14.248 --> 20:16.416
Do you know a man
who calls himself Guru Yash?

20:16.500 --> 20:17.793
[Rajan] OK, that's enough.

20:17.876 --> 20:19.962
All these questions
are completely inappropriate.

20:20.045 --> 20:21.505
They are simple questions, sir.

20:21.588 --> 20:24.216
If you want to continue
asking simple questions to my fiancée,

20:24.300 --> 20:26.344
you will do so
in the presence of my lawyer.

20:27.094 --> 20:28.095
Goodbye, detectives.

20:31.598 --> 20:32.683
Sir.

20:36.436 --> 20:37.271
Are you all right?

20:37.355 --> 20:39.857
Do they think
I had something to do with this?

20:40.732 --> 20:43.235
Kala, my father had many enemies.

20:43.319 --> 20:46.989
He frequently talked to the press
about corruption in the police force.

20:50.701 --> 20:53.829
- Do you think I had--
- My father had no business being there.

20:54.621 --> 20:56.748
He had so many death threats,
that going to the temple

20:56.832 --> 20:58.250
was just asking for trouble.

20:58.334 --> 21:00.836
You did nothing wrong, Kala.

21:08.427 --> 21:12.514
[piano playing "Mad World"]

21:15.851 --> 21:17.269
[sighs]

21:19.021 --> 21:21.606
[Hernando] There's a line in your film,
The Passion of the Sinner,

21:21.690 --> 21:23.734
that always makes me think of this museum.

21:24.526 --> 21:26.611
"My heart is not a clock."

21:28.572 --> 21:29.656
Yeah.

21:31.033 --> 21:33.118
My character was always late.

21:33.202 --> 21:37.289
Beautiful line...
made sublime by your performance.

21:37.373 --> 21:41.585
An apology... that is also an anthem.

21:42.586 --> 21:43.879
[soft chuckle]

21:43.962 --> 21:48.592
Look... love is not something we wind up,

21:48.675 --> 21:50.886
something we set or control.

21:50.969 --> 21:54.556
Love... is just like art.

21:55.474 --> 21:56.767
Ah...

21:56.850 --> 21:59.686
A force that comes
into our lives without any...

21:59.770 --> 22:03.023
rules, expectations or limitations, and...

22:04.858 --> 22:11.323
and every time I hear that line,
I am reminded that... love, like art...

22:14.659 --> 22:16.454
must always be free.

23:08.339 --> 23:09.673
[softly] You're Lito.

23:13.802 --> 23:14.928
You're Nomi.

23:17.806 --> 23:19.933
This really isn't a good time for me.

23:21.601 --> 23:24.146
It's not really a good time for me either.

23:24.229 --> 23:26.231
Why are you here then?

23:26.982 --> 23:28.400
I don't know.

23:32.404 --> 23:33.947
I was almost killed.

23:35.366 --> 23:37.909
I didn't know where to go,
so I went home.

23:39.244 --> 23:41.246
I was worried about Amanita...

23:42.540 --> 23:44.166
and missing the life that we used to have,

23:44.249 --> 23:46.877
and I was wondering
if I was ever gonna get it back.

23:50.714 --> 23:54.176
And the next thing I knew,
I was here.

23:55.677 --> 23:57.846
What is this place?

23:57.929 --> 24:00.015
It's the Diego Rivera Museum.

24:03.018 --> 24:04.895
[Nomi] The painter?

24:04.978 --> 24:06.438
Yeah.

24:07.898 --> 24:10.442
He was married to Frida Kahlo, right?

24:11.360 --> 24:12.570
Yes.

24:13.612 --> 24:18.450
The day she died, he said,
was the worst day of his life...

24:19.659 --> 24:22.913
because he realized too late
that the best thing about his life...

24:23.872 --> 24:25.332
was his love for her.

24:32.797 --> 24:34.466
You have a boyfriend?

24:38.554 --> 24:40.097
Not anymore.

24:43.642 --> 24:45.185
What happened?

24:47.521 --> 24:49.022
I got scared.

24:51.858 --> 24:55.070
I play heroes all the time,
but in real life, I'm a coward.

25:01.452 --> 25:03.621
Attention. 773?

25:03.703 --> 25:05.205
[door opens]

25:07.165 --> 25:08.833
You have a visitor.

25:19.303 --> 25:20.345
[door closes]

25:26.017 --> 25:27.102
[exhales softly]

25:37.821 --> 25:39.072
Thank you.

25:49.040 --> 25:52.252
I have not slept...
since you came here.

25:53.170 --> 25:55.213
I've never slept so well.

25:56.214 --> 25:59.259
- I am not a good person.
- Father, you owe me nothing.

25:59.343 --> 26:01.345
I am not a good person...

26:03.847 --> 26:09.811
but when your mother was alive...
I was a better person.

26:10.979 --> 26:12.439
She made me better.

26:14.525 --> 26:19.946
When she died...
I thought that part of me died with her.

26:22.907 --> 26:24.451
But it didn't.

26:26.537 --> 26:27.954
It is right here.

26:31.833 --> 26:36.254
My company, my wealth,

26:36.338 --> 26:38.382
even my reputation...

26:41.259 --> 26:43.679
is meaningless without my daughter.

26:49.893 --> 26:51.853
I am going to tell the truth.

26:57.568 --> 27:00.404
Hernando brought me here
on our first date.

27:03.156 --> 27:05.409
He said this is the only place
in Mexico City

27:05.492 --> 27:09.996
where you can really experience...
Diego Rivera.

27:12.541 --> 27:15.335
These are studies done for a painting

27:15.419 --> 27:18.505
that was originally commissioned
by John D. Rockefeller

27:18.589 --> 27:20.591
for his new center in New York.

27:21.592 --> 27:26.722
Diego changed the original design
and added Lenin, united with workers.

27:26.805 --> 27:29.433
- [Nomi chuckles softly]
- Rockefeller told him to repaint it.

27:29.516 --> 27:33.103
Diego refused...
so Rockefeller had it destroyed.

27:35.647 --> 27:39.276
Years later,
Diego repainted it here in Mexico...

27:40.402 --> 27:43.363
where he thought
the painting would live free.

27:45.657 --> 27:47.325
- But...
- Sadly, the actual painting

27:47.409 --> 27:49.536
has been reduced to nothing
but a whore pimped out

27:49.620 --> 27:51.538
by the Bank of Mexico and the Palacio.

27:51.622 --> 27:54.332
It is... controlled by censors

27:54.416 --> 27:57.628
who treat it exactly
like Rockefeller treated it.

28:00.171 --> 28:02.173
Diego would be ashamed of it.

28:04.468 --> 28:06.804
Nothing about it is free.

28:06.886 --> 28:10.390
All afternoon, he was telling me stories
about the art in here.

28:11.809 --> 28:15.771
Hernando can talk about football,
about wrestling,

28:15.854 --> 28:18.315
about paintings,
with such a passionate love.

28:18.398 --> 28:21.652
"You fuck with art," he says,
"you'll get fucked by art."

28:21.735 --> 28:23.278
[laughing]

28:23.361 --> 28:26.239
You see that sketch?
That one?

28:29.951 --> 28:31.662
That's Syphilis.

28:32.830 --> 28:34.080
Mm.

28:34.164 --> 28:36.291
He painted it over the head
of Rockefeller's father...

28:36.374 --> 28:38.251
...drinking with a dance hall girl.

28:40.086 --> 28:42.005
That's why I love it here.

28:44.048 --> 28:45.216
Here...

28:46.176 --> 28:49.346
you can feel
the wild and reckless heart...

28:51.139 --> 28:53.350
[sighs] ...of a Mexican artist...

28:55.059 --> 28:56.728
still beating.

29:00.190 --> 29:05.945
I was here listening to him for hours,
and... and I couldn't take it anymore.

29:15.121 --> 29:18.583
Our first kiss was over there...
in the bathroom.

29:20.126 --> 29:22.128
[panting]

29:22.212 --> 29:25.549
It was for me a religious experience.

29:31.388 --> 29:33.014
I went to my knees.

29:33.097 --> 29:34.892
[panting]

29:39.103 --> 29:41.147
And took him into my mouth like...

29:42.816 --> 29:45.318
I was taking Holy Communion.

29:51.282 --> 29:52.242
[moans]

29:53.493 --> 29:56.580
That kind of kiss... changes you.

29:59.499 --> 30:01.543
I told Hernando from the beginning, I...

30:02.878 --> 30:05.296
I told him how it had to be.

30:06.089 --> 30:07.674
What went wrong?

30:08.884 --> 30:10.468
I did.

30:11.887 --> 30:16.433
I'm afraid I will lose everything...
that I've worked for.

30:21.646 --> 30:23.565
I know how that feels.

30:25.483 --> 30:29.320
But at a certain point, I realized
there's a huge difference between

30:29.404 --> 30:32.282
what we work for and what we live for.

30:36.703 --> 30:39.664
My whole life,
all I wanted to be was an actor.

30:39.748 --> 30:44.795
But you can't be an actor
and get the parts I want... and be gay.

30:49.549 --> 30:50.884
I love dolls.

30:53.386 --> 30:55.973
My father could never forgive me for that.

30:56.890 --> 31:01.561
When I was eight years old,
my father made me join a swim club.

31:01.645 --> 31:04.522
He'd been on the same club and...

31:05.398 --> 31:08.109
he said that the things
that he learned in that locker room

31:08.192 --> 31:10.946
were the things that made him
the man that he is today.

31:12.823 --> 31:14.992
I hated that locker room.

31:15.951 --> 31:18.662
At that age,
I was really uncomfortable with my body.

31:18.745 --> 31:22.666
I didn't like to be naked,
especially in front of other boys.

31:24.001 --> 31:26.878
But you had to take a shower
before you could go in the pool,

31:26.962 --> 31:30.089
so I would do it,
but I would wear my suit and a tee shirt.

31:31.049 --> 31:34.427
And the boys would tease me,
but I would try to hurry and...

31:34.511 --> 31:37.180
ignore them, and it--
it worked for a while.

31:38.473 --> 31:40.517
And then one day it didn't.

31:41.184 --> 31:43.186
[showers running]

31:44.103 --> 31:45.563
I don't know how it started,

31:45.647 --> 31:51.028
but I remember having this feeling
that something bad was going to happen.

31:51.110 --> 31:52.570
[boy's voice echoes] Hey, faggot!

31:53.363 --> 31:54.823
Why do you shower with your clothes on?

31:54.906 --> 31:56.700
[boy 2] Because he ain't got a dick.

31:56.783 --> 31:59.828
I made the mistake
of standing up for myself.

32:00.704 --> 32:03.247
- You got wood, faggot?
- [boys snickering]

32:03.331 --> 32:05.291
[voice echoes] Let's strip him!

32:05.375 --> 32:07.878
- [young Nomi] No, no, no, no!
- [boys laughing]

32:08.795 --> 32:12.173
The hot water came from
the same boiler that heated the radiator.

32:12.256 --> 32:16.094
- [screaming]
- [laughter]

32:16.928 --> 32:21.558
I still have scars on my stomach
from the second-degree burns.

32:22.684 --> 32:24.061
[laughter continues]

32:25.937 --> 32:27.772
[shouting]

32:27.856 --> 32:29.232
Stop it!

32:33.236 --> 32:35.072
Fucking monsters.

32:41.327 --> 32:42.662
I'm sorry.

32:47.918 --> 32:51.421
That locker room might have
made my father the man that he is,

32:51.504 --> 32:55.425
but it also made me the woman that I am.

32:57.135 --> 32:59.888
After that, I quit the swim club.

33:00.597 --> 33:04.225
I quit trying to fit in,
trying to be one of them.

33:04.308 --> 33:06.185
I knew I never would be.

33:07.812 --> 33:10.732
But more importantly,
I didn't want to be.

33:11.357 --> 33:12.859
Their violence...

33:14.402 --> 33:19.490
was petty and ignorant, but ultimately,
it was true to who they were.

33:22.035 --> 33:23.745
The real violence...

33:25.789 --> 33:28.458
the violence that
I realized was unforgivable...

33:29.333 --> 33:32.420
is the violence that we do to ourselves,

33:32.503 --> 33:35.256
when we're too afraid
to be who we really are.

33:57.320 --> 33:58.571
There you are.

33:59.322 --> 34:00.740
I needed a chai.

34:00.824 --> 34:02.450
I made one for you, too.

34:04.577 --> 34:05.787
Thank you.

34:08.623 --> 34:09.666
What?

34:09.749 --> 34:13.128
You've been through so much,
I almost hate to ask--

34:13.211 --> 34:14.253
What?

34:14.337 --> 34:17.007
It's Mother.
She says she needs to see you.

34:17.090 --> 34:18.842
Oh.

34:18.925 --> 34:21.219
OK. Of course.

34:28.935 --> 34:31.562
[heart monitor beeps steadily]

34:35.483 --> 34:36.818
[softly] Come here.

34:45.160 --> 34:47.578
Rajan says you pray often.

34:47.662 --> 34:49.372
I do.

34:49.455 --> 34:51.082
Sometimes.

34:54.460 --> 34:57.047
I was born in Bombay.

34:57.130 --> 35:00.967
Every Tuesday, I used to go
to the Shree Siddhivinayak temple.

35:02.260 --> 35:06.890
But when I got married...
Manendra wouldn't have it.

35:12.645 --> 35:14.438
My husband is a good man.

35:15.857 --> 35:17.901
He helps many people.

35:19.903 --> 35:21.946
He cares about people.

35:24.323 --> 35:29.996
Please, would you...
pray with me to Shri Ganesh?

35:30.747 --> 35:33.208
Tell Shri Ganesh he's a g-- good man?

35:34.500 --> 35:35.793
Of course.

35:38.129 --> 35:39.338
[whispers] Thank you.

36:05.823 --> 36:07.158
[sets brake]

36:12.914 --> 36:15.458
Your father and I visit here sometimes.

36:19.170 --> 36:20.755
We sit with them.

36:23.216 --> 36:24.467
He plays music.

36:25.343 --> 36:27.804
How many times
have I heard that fucking song?

36:33.143 --> 36:34.978
One time, it was too cold.

36:36.771 --> 36:38.356
I told him I didn't want to go.

36:39.607 --> 36:42.777
I said it was stupid
and a waste of time because...

36:42.860 --> 36:44.904
nothing mattered to them anymore.

36:50.994 --> 36:53.454
He told me he didn't do it for them.

36:54.497 --> 36:57.583
He said he did it
whenever he missed you.

37:12.974 --> 37:14.225
[door shuts]

37:25.403 --> 37:27.655
I'm sorry I haven't come back.

37:34.245 --> 37:36.122
I wasn't strong enough.

37:46.007 --> 37:50.428
I thought I-- I would stand here
and want to die again.

37:52.847 --> 37:56.059
Or worse, that I would stand here
and not want to.

38:00.355 --> 38:03.482
[sighs deeply]

38:23.794 --> 38:27.924
Sometimes I look at myself in the mirror
and I don't know who I am.

38:33.804 --> 38:38.351
I still think of you...
coming to my school.

38:39.310 --> 38:41.354
[hooves echoing]

38:50.696 --> 38:51.906
[Magnus] Come with me.

39:00.998 --> 39:04.252
It's like something
that happened to someone else.

39:06.337 --> 39:08.089
The me that loved you...

39:10.091 --> 39:13.261
that wanted to have
a huge family with you...

39:15.096 --> 39:17.098
that me's not this me.

39:18.516 --> 39:20.477
That me is here with you.

39:27.024 --> 39:28.734
[trembling exhale]

39:28.818 --> 39:30.694
[whispers] And with you.

39:40.955 --> 39:42.206
[sniffles]

39:52.049 --> 39:55.470
[light noise outside door]

40:00.683 --> 40:02.018
[lock turns]

40:06.481 --> 40:08.107
[gasping]

40:08.191 --> 40:09.775
- [knife clatters]
- Oh, honey!

40:10.401 --> 40:12.362
[Neets] Oh...

40:12.445 --> 40:15.156
- [sobbing]
- [Neets] OK.

40:18.117 --> 40:19.743
Oh...

40:22.246 --> 40:24.332
I knew you'd be here.

40:24.415 --> 40:26.250
I knew you'd find me.

40:29.753 --> 40:30.921
You all right?

40:31.839 --> 40:33.299
[whispers] I am now.

40:45.478 --> 40:46.854
[door slams]

40:47.813 --> 40:49.065
[sighs]

40:56.864 --> 40:57.948
Hello.

40:59.658 --> 41:01.411
How's Iceland?

41:04.414 --> 41:05.956
You'd rather be here?

41:20.221 --> 41:21.639
[Capheus sighs]

41:25.976 --> 41:27.562
I know how that is.

41:29.522 --> 41:32.609
I spent all night
wishing this day would never come.

41:35.861 --> 41:39.240
Do you think other animals
waste as much time as us...

41:39.323 --> 41:42.910
wishing for things they know...
they'll never get?

41:50.251 --> 41:52.795
You don't have to talk
if you don't want to.

41:56.424 --> 41:58.801
[voice trembles]
I've never told anyone.

41:58.884 --> 42:01.178
[breath quavering]

42:07.017 --> 42:10.271
[sobs] I couldn't go to the funeral.

42:13.316 --> 42:18.154
He was my husband, I loved him,
but I-- I couldn't say goodbye.

42:21.449 --> 42:23.284
But you have now.

42:24.494 --> 42:26.287
[sniffling]

42:29.415 --> 42:31.334
I don't believe it's possible.

42:34.878 --> 42:37.507
Death doesn't let you say goodbye.

42:40.759 --> 42:41.927
It just...

42:42.970 --> 42:45.306
carves holes in your life...

42:47.350 --> 42:49.018
in your future...

42:52.313 --> 42:54.023
in your heart.

43:04.033 --> 43:05.535
[soft exhale]

43:08.037 --> 43:09.288
[sighs]

43:10.956 --> 43:13.501
My sister was born when I was eight.

43:16.879 --> 43:19.507
She was so small and delicate.

43:19.590 --> 43:21.676
[waterfall rushing]

43:31.686 --> 43:33.563
I carried her around all the time.

43:34.772 --> 43:39.610
Her eyes were huge...
full of so much joy and mischief.

43:47.826 --> 43:49.286
I loved her.

43:53.249 --> 43:55.292
[baby crying]

43:59.088 --> 44:01.090
But we did not have any food.

44:03.884 --> 44:06.637
Our mother was unable to produce any milk.

44:26.657 --> 44:29.868
If we did not give her to the nuns,
she would have died.

44:36.333 --> 44:41.171
Saying goodbye was the...
hardest thing I've ever done.

44:45.426 --> 44:47.637
[sobbing softly]

44:55.603 --> 44:57.480
I never saw her again.

45:05.154 --> 45:07.364
I cried as if she had died.

45:09.199 --> 45:10.951
In a way, she did.

45:15.038 --> 45:18.751
But... in another way...

45:20.419 --> 45:21.754
she lived.

45:24.799 --> 45:28.552
That day, I learned life and death
are always so mixed up together,

45:28.636 --> 45:32.097
in the same way
some beginnings are endings...

45:33.432 --> 45:36.727
and some endings become beginnings.

45:53.243 --> 45:54.620
[chuckles]

45:57.206 --> 46:01.418
I know the smart characters always hide
in plain sight, but in our own apartment?

46:02.378 --> 46:04.338
They won't look for me here for a while.

46:05.506 --> 46:06.674
How can you be sure?

46:07.633 --> 46:10.594
I used Will's badge number to BOLO myself.

46:11.387 --> 46:14.515
"Last seen getting
on a plane to Australia."

46:14.598 --> 46:16.350
Australia?

46:20.563 --> 46:22.398
We do have friends we could stay with.

46:24.024 --> 46:25.442
No.

46:25.526 --> 46:27.820
Not after what happened to your mom.

46:27.904 --> 46:30.573
I don't want my trouble
hurting anybody else.

46:32.533 --> 46:34.911
[sighs] You mean "our" trouble.

46:40.875 --> 46:42.501
[Nomi chuckles softly]

46:43.544 --> 46:45.963
["Knockin' On Heaven's Door" plays]

47:41.852 --> 47:43.854
[line ringing]

47:48.567 --> 47:51.737
[recording plays] Hello, this is Hernando.
Now you say something.

47:51.821 --> 47:52.947
[answering machine beeps]

47:53.030 --> 47:57.200
[Lito] Hernando, please pick up the phone,
OK? It's Lito again.

47:57.284 --> 47:59.286
[line ringing]

48:03.290 --> 48:06.836
[recording plays] Hello, this is Hernando.
Now you say something.

48:06.919 --> 48:07.962
[answering machine beeps]

48:09.379 --> 48:11.465
Hernando, it's me again.

48:11.548 --> 48:14.134
Call me back.
It's really important.

48:18.973 --> 48:21.141
[panting]

48:21.224 --> 48:23.644
[line ringing]

48:23.727 --> 48:26.814
[recording plays] Hello, this is Hernando.
Now you say something.

48:26.897 --> 48:28.024
[answering machine beeps]

48:28.899 --> 48:30.860
[sobs] Hernando!

48:31.735 --> 48:35.113
[recording plays] Hello, this is Hernando.
Now you say something.

48:35.197 --> 48:38.075
- [answering machine beeps]
- [Lito] Hernando, it's me.

48:38.158 --> 48:41.119
Please call me back. I lost a flip-flop.

48:41.203 --> 48:42.579
[answering machine beeps]

48:42.663 --> 48:44.581
[Lito] The bathtub doesn't work. Um...

48:46.500 --> 48:50.462
[sobbing]
I cannot get it to work, Hernando.

48:55.634 --> 48:58.428
[recording plays] Hello, this is Hernando.
Now you say something.

48:58.512 --> 49:00.347
- [answering machine beeps]
- [sobs] Just call me back.

49:00.430 --> 49:01.431
It's very important.

49:05.644 --> 49:07.897
[line ringing]

49:07.980 --> 49:10.190
[crying]

49:15.529 --> 49:18.448
[recording plays] Hello, this is Hernando.
Now you say something.

49:18.532 --> 49:20.242
[answering machine beeps]

49:20.325 --> 49:23.037
[softly] Hernando... it's me again.

49:24.997 --> 49:29.292
Look, I...
I understand why you won't pick up.

49:29.376 --> 49:30.753
This is my fault.

49:33.839 --> 49:37.551
I've always tried
to be worthy of your love, but now...

49:43.390 --> 49:44.934
[sobs]

49:46.018 --> 49:47.561
Now I'm not...

49:51.314 --> 49:54.568
I disappointed you, I...
I've let you down.

49:55.611 --> 49:57.362
I've let Daniela down.

50:04.036 --> 50:05.203
[sighs]

50:06.163 --> 50:07.664
Hernando, I...

50:09.374 --> 50:10.793
I miss you.

50:12.544 --> 50:14.088
I miss your voice.

50:16.339 --> 50:19.384
I have all these voices in my head,
but yours...

50:21.929 --> 50:24.681
- it's the only one I can't live without.
- [line beeps]

50:24.765 --> 50:26.475
- I--
- [female voice] Mailbox is full.

50:30.646 --> 50:31.688
[phone thuds]

50:33.899 --> 50:37.027
[sobbing] Hernando...

50:42.658 --> 50:44.367
[sobbing] I'm sorry.

50:47.913 --> 50:49.957
I'm sorry.

50:52.584 --> 50:54.711
I'm-- I'm sorry.

51:18.861 --> 51:19.862
[clicks]

51:26.702 --> 51:28.328
It's fake.

51:29.205 --> 51:30.831
It's fake...

51:31.790 --> 51:33.500
like everything in my life.

51:35.794 --> 51:37.213
I'm a fake.

51:38.547 --> 51:40.549
[sighs] I'm a liar.

51:41.758 --> 51:43.886
All I know how to do is lie.
