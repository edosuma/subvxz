WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:05.871
- I've collected
way, way too much

00:05.973 --> 00:08.807
- This is the first time I
have ever worked with someone

00:08.909 --> 00:10.275
who has purchased a home

00:10.378 --> 00:13.479
and never lived in it
because of their hoard.

00:16.083 --> 00:19.284
- Code Enforcement told me I
could not live in this house.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.320
- [Cory] We are never going
to get through this house.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.489
You're supposed
to be his caretaker.

00:23.591 --> 00:24.490
- It's just too much for me.

00:24.592 --> 00:25.891
- [Cory] You're causing
more issues here,

00:25.993 --> 00:28.027
so you could get
charged with neglect.

00:28.129 --> 00:31.130
- I have honestly never seen
anything like this before.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.132
- We're really
struggling with Terri.

00:33.968 --> 00:35.534
- That really upsets me,
I hear-

00:35.636 --> 00:36.168
- Why are you yelling
at me again?

00:36.270 --> 00:37.636
- Don't say this to me

00:37.738 --> 00:38.737
right now!

00:38.839 --> 00:39.772
- Terri, what's going on?

00:39.874 --> 00:42.341
- I can't stay here
and help you anymore!

00:42.443 --> 00:43.742
- I am a mandated reporter

00:43.844 --> 00:46.545
and I have to call Adult
Protective Services.

00:47.848 --> 00:50.749
(suspenseful music)

01:40.968 --> 01:43.969
- I'm Terri, I'm a
private caregiver,

01:45.072 --> 01:48.140
an artist, an antiquer,

01:48.242 --> 01:52.845
and I've collected
way, way, way too much.

01:57.785 --> 02:01.153
I have books, antiques
and pots and pans,

02:02.957 --> 02:06.091
collectable glass, jewelry.

02:06.193 --> 02:08.527
I've got threads for sewing

02:08.629 --> 02:12.264
and drawing supplies
for my artwork.

02:12.366 --> 02:15.067
I've collected so much

02:15.169 --> 02:19.338
that it's hard to get from
one room to the other.

02:20.708 --> 02:25.277
I'm stepping over things
and moving things around,

02:25.379 --> 02:30.115
hoping that I can stack
them without them falling.

02:31.619 --> 02:32.951
I'm sick.

02:33.053 --> 02:35.053
I'm overwhelmed and

02:35.156 --> 02:39.892
struggling to organize it.

02:46.600 --> 02:50.569
- I am Kraig, Terri is
my long-time girlfriend.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.205
Terri is an Olympic
champion hoarder, no doubt.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.875
She would receive a
gold medal in hoarding.

02:59.313 --> 03:02.214
Terri has no limits on what
she might put in her house.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.485
She's a wonderful artist also,

03:08.122 --> 03:10.055
and she has beautiful artwork.

03:12.026 --> 03:14.193
- This is one of my pieces.

03:14.295 --> 03:18.764
And here's another one.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.966
- I'm Peggy and I am
Terri's younger sister.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.670
- One of my old drawings.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.407
- The last time I was in
her house, 15 years ago,

03:28.509 --> 03:29.575
it was definitely,

03:30.778 --> 03:32.277
it was a mess.

03:32.379 --> 03:33.879
I was seeing crap, you know,

03:33.981 --> 03:36.148
just junky kind of stuff.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.749
It just wasn't livable.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.860
- For 45 years, Terri
and I have been together,

03:48.963 --> 03:51.163
boyfriend and girlfriend.

03:51.265 --> 03:53.432
We've discussed being married;

03:53.534 --> 03:57.002
however, we are not
alike and compatible

03:57.104 --> 04:00.505
when it comes to putting
things in a house.

04:00.608 --> 04:05.177
Terri and I have argued
frequently about this hoarding

04:05.279 --> 04:07.813
and the arguing has
strained our relationship.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.484
- I'm Kathy, I'm
Terri's girlfriend

04:12.586 --> 04:14.820
and one of Kraig's
younger sisters.

04:16.690 --> 04:19.891
I know that Kraig and Terri
have wanted to get married,

04:19.994 --> 04:22.594
but the hoarding
has really blocked

04:22.696 --> 04:24.796
Kraig from moving forward.

04:24.898 --> 04:27.332
I can remember one
particular time

04:27.434 --> 04:30.969
when Terri had a
truck full of items

04:31.071 --> 04:33.338
and Kraig said, "I
will marry you Terri,

04:33.440 --> 04:36.275
"if you just clear
out that truck."

04:36.377 --> 04:39.544
And it never was cleared.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.113
And she didn't want to do it.

04:44.118 --> 04:47.686
- Terri's hoarding has
been a great worry.

04:47.788 --> 04:51.290
As she's spent her money,
she's gotten way behind

04:51.392 --> 04:54.493
on her house payments
and other kind of bills.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.473
- It's sad to think that

05:10.911 --> 05:12.844
we're the love of
each other's life's

05:12.946 --> 05:14.479
and never have married.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.151
- I like to say that
I'm the most patient man

05:19.253 --> 05:20.652
this side of the Mississippi.

05:24.024 --> 05:24.923
- And,

05:25.025 --> 05:28.994
and I've scared him
by being scattered.

05:35.536 --> 05:39.171
- Terri was always
a unique individual.

05:39.273 --> 05:42.107
She's very creative,
very artistic,

05:42.209 --> 05:45.143
but we didn't always
see eye to eye.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.847
I think we clashed.

05:48.949 --> 05:49.915
Terri's just very sensitive.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.184
It doesn't matter
what's said sometimes

05:52.286 --> 05:53.952
and she's sensitive about it.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.292
- I'm Cheryl, I'm
Terri's older sister.

06:02.096 --> 06:04.062
When Terri and I were in school,

06:04.164 --> 06:07.399
I would definitely say she
had some ADHD going on.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.634
When she would get
excited or upset,

06:09.737 --> 06:13.238
she would get very
disorganized with her speech.

06:13.340 --> 06:16.308
But Terri always
had a lot of class,

06:16.410 --> 06:18.977
on her clothing and her shoes.

06:21.315 --> 06:23.582
- I'm Cindy and I'm
Terri's younger sister.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.151
My mom liked quality.

06:26.253 --> 06:28.854
She appreciated
the finer things.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.056
Terri did get that from my mom.

06:32.259 --> 06:36.094
- She taught us what
quality items were

06:36.196 --> 06:39.331
and she loved garage sales.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.267
- As we were growing up,

06:42.369 --> 06:45.003
my mom filled the house
up with, you know,

06:45.105 --> 06:46.772
mainly second hand items

06:46.874 --> 06:48.974
that she picked up
from garage sales.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.811
I think it was a
hoarding situation.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.981
I know my dad certainly told
her that she was a hoarder.

06:58.452 --> 07:00.952
- Mom would buy
things for us girls.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.388
She would buy things
for other people.

07:03.490 --> 07:06.558
So, she was always
thinking of somebody else,

07:06.660 --> 07:09.861
and I picked up from that.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.267
Later in life, different friends

07:15.369 --> 07:16.968
would want to see what I bought

07:17.070 --> 07:20.172
and they thought
I had a great eye.

07:20.274 --> 07:24.576
And as I had friends that sold

07:24.678 --> 07:28.313
at flea markets and
in antique stores,

07:28.415 --> 07:31.850
I decided to have a shop myself.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.121
- In the early 80's, Terri and I

07:36.223 --> 07:38.423
had a little antique shop.

07:38.525 --> 07:41.359
We used to go together
to garage sales

07:41.462 --> 07:44.162
and estate sales
and purchase things.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.565
Terri was always
the lead on that.

07:46.667 --> 07:50.368
She was quicker at grabbing
things and had a better eye.

07:50.471 --> 07:53.972
After several years,
I became disinterested

07:54.074 --> 07:57.309
as I was working as an
occupational therapist

07:57.411 --> 07:59.277
and just didn't have the time.

07:59.379 --> 08:02.514
Terri also quit not
long after that,

08:02.616 --> 08:04.816
but of course, Terri continued

08:04.918 --> 08:07.385
buying things and buying things,

08:07.488 --> 08:10.889
even though she did not have
a shop to sell things in.

08:18.599 --> 08:21.933
(suspenseful music)

08:22.035 --> 08:25.570
- Six years ago,
Code Enforcement came

08:25.672 --> 08:28.540
and told me I could
not live in this house.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.044
I could not be
here at nighttime,

08:33.146 --> 08:37.582
but I could work and get
things together in the daytime.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.419
Where is it?

08:41.522 --> 08:42.988
I can't find it.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.658
The type of work that I've
done as a private caregiver,

08:46.760 --> 08:50.228
I've lived with families 24/7,

08:50.330 --> 08:53.999
so I didn't need to
live in this house.

08:54.101 --> 08:57.002
And that created more problems

08:57.104 --> 09:01.172
because I was still
buying and collecting,

09:01.275 --> 09:04.976
so this home became
a storage for me.

09:15.956 --> 09:18.256
- Terri lived with my aunt.

09:18.358 --> 09:23.128
She had become ill, and as
Terri lived in that home,

09:23.230 --> 09:25.063
she hoarded in that house.

09:27.401 --> 09:30.669
And then Terri
moved into my house

09:30.771 --> 09:35.073
where she helped my mother,
who developed Alzheimer's,

09:35.175 --> 09:39.744
and Terri was accumulating
vast amounts of items.

09:39.846 --> 09:41.646
(driving music)

09:48.522 --> 09:51.690
- Instead of getting
rid of my things,

09:51.792 --> 09:54.926
I've put things in Roy's garage.

09:55.028 --> 09:57.762
I put things in his basement,

09:57.864 --> 09:59.497
in the spare room

09:59.600 --> 10:02.200
and I put things
in the living room.

10:03.337 --> 10:06.605
I've even put
things in Roy's car.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.012
We don't need no,
no, no, no, no.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.313
We don't need this anymore, Roy.

10:15.415 --> 10:17.115
Let me, I got fresh coffee.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.219
I had do this for while
I was in the shower.

10:22.255 --> 10:25.657
When I took the
private job with Roy,

10:26.960 --> 10:29.995
I had two other caregivers
that were helping.

10:31.331 --> 10:35.934
But as time passed, Roy
favored me as his caregiver.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.670
And breakfast is
almost ready, Roy.

10:40.073 --> 10:44.709
And before I knew it, I
was his 24 hour caregiver.

10:45.846 --> 10:49.981
And Kraig was hurt
with me being with Roy

10:50.083 --> 10:53.685
more than what I
could be with him,

10:54.788 --> 10:59.024
and he felt slighted
and cheated.

10:59.126 --> 11:02.427
- I pleaded with
Terri to get a job

11:02.529 --> 11:07.465
that didn't require her to
be working 24 hours a day.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.702
But my pleads were unanswered.

11:10.804 --> 11:13.772
- I felt confused and yet,
I was at the same time

11:13.874 --> 11:17.208
trying to be the good
nurse for both of them.

11:17.310 --> 11:19.144
- It's not a good situation.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.945
There are times when
I don't see Terri

11:21.048 --> 11:23.048
but a half a day a week.

11:23.150 --> 11:24.849
- Thank you Lord. For this day,

11:24.951 --> 11:26.217
- One of the other difficulties,

11:26.319 --> 11:27.952
is she takes care of Roy,

11:28.055 --> 11:30.388
but Roy sees her as a partner.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.957
- I'm just grateful for so much.

11:33.060 --> 11:33.692
Amen.

11:33.794 --> 11:34.959
- Amen

11:35.062 --> 11:36.294
- Okay.

11:36.396 --> 11:39.164
- Roy is jealous of her, does
not want her to be at Kraig's,

11:39.266 --> 11:41.533
does not want to
hear about Kraig

11:41.635 --> 11:44.269
and Kraig doesn't want
to hear about Roy.

11:45.639 --> 11:47.405
- Roy has been
married three times

11:47.507 --> 11:49.674
and it concerns
me that he thinks

11:49.776 --> 11:52.110
of Terri as his fourth wife.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.044
- It should be hot enough.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.213
- It's an unhealthy
relationship.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.581
Terri told me the other day

11:56.683 --> 11:58.616
that she wished she
only had a few items

11:58.719 --> 12:01.252
at Roy's house so
she could leave.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.421
But she can't because
of her items there.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.829
- Where did it go?

12:12.365 --> 12:17.869
I am juggling caring for Roy,

12:19.106 --> 12:22.574
taking care of the things
that are in his home

12:22.676 --> 12:24.509
and giving time to Kraig.

12:27.013 --> 12:28.646
And it's not coming together.

12:31.084 --> 12:34.085
I'm scared, I'm
worried about Kraig,

12:34.187 --> 12:35.386
his health.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.490
- Terri helps me with
my health problems.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.425
I have multiple sclerosis now.

12:40.527 --> 12:45.029
My ability to walk
is decreasing.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.600
- She needs to be
there for Kraig.

12:48.702 --> 12:50.568
Kraig needs her and
she needs Kraig.

12:52.906 --> 12:56.941
- Terri is sweet,
she's graceful.

12:57.043 --> 12:59.144
Terri's a wonderful artist.

12:59.246 --> 13:02.180
Terri inside and out
is a wonderful person.

13:03.250 --> 13:06.017
But Terri's hoarding
has interfered

13:06.119 --> 13:08.419
with my desire to be married.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.791
If Terri is able
to clean the house

13:13.593 --> 13:15.193
and make good decisions,

13:16.363 --> 13:19.564
I will be ready to
propose marriage and

13:20.901 --> 13:21.766
start a,

13:24.237 --> 13:25.103
start a new life.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.413
(suspenseful music)

13:39.186 --> 13:41.820
- Terri is the opposite of me.

13:41.922 --> 13:45.190
She clutters a room,
clutters the house.

13:46.660 --> 13:50.361
I'm at a loss as to why
Terri hoards so many things.

13:50.463 --> 13:51.996
I really do not understand.

13:52.098 --> 13:54.799
(dramatic music)

14:00.574 --> 14:01.606
- Terri?

14:01.708 --> 14:03.408
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Dr. Zasio.

14:03.510 --> 14:04.209
- Nice to meet you.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.844
It is nice to meet you, too.

14:05.946 --> 14:06.945
Thank you for having me.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.379
- I'm happy you're here.

14:08.481 --> 14:09.914
- I'm Dr. Robin Zasio.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.716
I'm a licensed
clinical psychologist

14:11.818 --> 14:15.220
and I specialize in helping
people with hoarding disorder.

14:15.322 --> 14:16.888
How are you feeling
about me being here?

14:16.990 --> 14:20.191
- I'm happy and yet
I'm nervous, too.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.327
- What makes Terri
especially different

14:22.429 --> 14:24.729
is that she was standing
outside waiting for me

14:24.831 --> 14:27.665
because she doesn't
live in her home.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.334
Well, I'm just here to help

14:29.436 --> 14:31.736
to do a job that you
can't do on your own.

14:31.838 --> 14:33.304
- Okay.
- So the first place to start

14:33.406 --> 14:34.439
is to go into your house

14:34.541 --> 14:36.307
so I can get a good
idea of what's going on.

14:36.409 --> 14:36.975
- Okay.
- Alright?

14:37.077 --> 14:38.209
- Okay.
- Let's go.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.652
Well, it's a little
tight in here.

14:47.754 --> 14:48.486
- Yes.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.655
- Yeah, you've been busy, Terri.

14:50.757 --> 14:53.892
- Well, this is the kitchen.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.126
- Where?

14:55.228 --> 14:56.194
- Right here.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.264
This is the kitchen.

14:59.366 --> 15:00.899
- Oh, wow.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.133
When I first stepped
into the house,

15:02.235 --> 15:05.103
I was immediately taken back
that I was in the kitchen.

15:05.205 --> 15:08.973
There was no sign
that this was an area

15:09.075 --> 15:11.442
where people would
cook and dine.

15:11.544 --> 15:14.846
Not a lot of kitchen stuff
happening in here, huh?

15:14.948 --> 15:15.880
- No.

15:15.982 --> 15:18.049
- When was the last
time you cooked in here?

15:18.151 --> 15:22.086
- I don't know that I've ever
put anything in the oven.

15:22.188 --> 15:24.188
- When did you
purchase this home?

15:25.125 --> 15:28.126
- In 1998.

15:28.228 --> 15:31.362
- So, roughly 23 years ago.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.097
- Coming up on 23 years, yes.

15:33.199 --> 15:35.733
- Correct me if I'm mistaken,

15:35.835 --> 15:38.970
but it kind of immediately
became a storage unit for you.

15:39.072 --> 15:39.637
- Yes.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.472
- This is the first time

15:41.574 --> 15:43.274
I have ever worked with someone

15:43.376 --> 15:44.876
who has purchased a home

15:44.978 --> 15:48.413
and never lived in it
because of their hoard.

15:48.515 --> 15:52.083
This is a truly
unique situation.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.752
You bought the house because
you wanted to live in it.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.054
- Yes.

15:56.156 --> 15:59.090
- And you downsized and you
brought all of this stuff in.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.292
- I could have made space

16:01.394 --> 16:02.160
to live in it
- Right,

16:02.262 --> 16:03.795
right, you could
have made space.

16:03.897 --> 16:05.530
- Uh huh.
- But what I'm talking about

16:05.632 --> 16:09.000
is freedom to access all
of the areas of the house.

16:09.102 --> 16:09.801
- Right.
- Okay?

16:09.903 --> 16:11.469
So let me ask you a question.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.071
- Uh huh?
- What does all this stuff

16:13.173 --> 16:14.472
mean to you?

16:14.574 --> 16:18.109
- Well, right now
it's killing me,

16:18.211 --> 16:20.578
so it doesn't mean much to me

16:20.680 --> 16:24.449
other than just it having
slowed my life down.

16:24.551 --> 16:27.085
- [Dr. Zasio] And so you are
living somewhere else right now

16:27.187 --> 16:28.553
cause this isn't livable?

16:28.655 --> 16:31.656
- [Terri] Yes,
this was condemned.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.057
I could work in the house,

16:33.159 --> 16:34.592
but I couldn't
live in the house.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.060
- Okay, okay.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.796
That's just gotta be
so difficult, Terri,

16:38.898 --> 16:40.531
to have a home that
you can't even live in.

16:40.633 --> 16:43.868
- Sure, I mean it's
horrible to be told

16:43.970 --> 16:47.705
that they're going to put
a sign on your door, too.

16:47.807 --> 16:52.744
- Yeah, so what percentage
do you think needs to go?

16:54.547 --> 16:56.247
- Probably 80%.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.048
- Okay.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.983
Do you think as you look around,

16:59.085 --> 17:00.651
do you think you're
going to hit that?

17:00.754 --> 17:02.053
- Well, I'm sure going to try.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.988
- Okay, okay.

17:04.090 --> 17:05.857
She said 80%.

17:05.959 --> 17:07.492
If we can hit that,

17:07.594 --> 17:09.694
I think we'll be in
pretty good shape.

17:09.796 --> 17:12.363
I do think with the amount
of stuff in that house,

17:12.465 --> 17:14.766
we probably have to
get closer to 90%,

17:14.868 --> 17:17.035
but I'll take 80% if
she can get there.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.503
I want to see more of the house.

17:18.605 --> 17:19.871
- Okay.
- Alright, you ready?

17:19.973 --> 17:20.838
- Yep.
- Okay.

17:25.011 --> 17:26.144
Hang on.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.145
Okay.

17:32.452 --> 17:35.653
You've got all of
this beautiful artwork

17:35.755 --> 17:38.923
around the room and
it took some time

17:39.025 --> 17:41.025
to hang it, to display it.

17:41.127 --> 17:42.493
Tell me about that.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.495
- Some of it's my things

17:44.597 --> 17:49.033
and it's some things
that I collected and-

17:49.135 --> 17:50.501
- Are you a collector?

17:50.603 --> 17:51.469
- Sure I am.

17:51.571 --> 17:55.206
- Okay, and so
where do we tip the

17:55.308 --> 17:59.877
"I'm a collector" to "I
have hoarding problems"?

17:59.979 --> 18:03.314
- It's taken me a
really long time

18:03.416 --> 18:05.316
to consider myself a hoarder,

18:05.418 --> 18:06.617
- Uh huh.

18:06.719 --> 18:09.053
- and I'm dealing with that.

18:09.155 --> 18:10.221
- Uh huh.

18:10.323 --> 18:14.459
What is your goal with all
these amazing art pieces,

18:14.561 --> 18:18.062
as well as your genuine
collectible items?

18:18.164 --> 18:21.299
- I've dreamt from the time
that I bought this place

18:21.401 --> 18:23.568
to have an art
studio in the house.

18:23.670 --> 18:24.469
- Okay.

18:24.571 --> 18:25.303
- And

18:27.273 --> 18:29.440
do paintings and drawings.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.375
- You're clearly very talented

18:31.478 --> 18:33.177
and you have a very good eye.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.613
So, we'll keep our
eye on the ball

18:35.715 --> 18:37.582
to get your house in order,

18:37.684 --> 18:41.586
especially with the goal of
getting you an art studio

18:41.688 --> 18:44.589
so that you can continue
with what is clearly

18:44.691 --> 18:45.990
an incredible talent for you.

18:46.092 --> 18:48.326
She's an artist, and
it's really important

18:48.428 --> 18:50.695
for her to have her
own studio in her home.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.663
She's going to have
to make a distinction

18:52.765 --> 18:54.298
between her artwork,

18:54.400 --> 18:57.368
which is basically going
to fill a lot of her home

18:57.470 --> 19:01.305
and getting rid of the things
that are not of value to her.

19:01.407 --> 19:02.440
You're not married?

19:02.542 --> 19:04.275
- No, I have a sweetheart.

19:04.377 --> 19:04.876
- You do?

19:04.978 --> 19:06.077
- His name is Kraig.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.044
- Okay.

19:07.147 --> 19:10.414
- And we've known
each other since 1976.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.283
- Oh my gosh, okay?

19:12.385 --> 19:16.587
- And we've talked a little
bit about future plans

19:16.689 --> 19:20.525
and yet this has
been a hindrance,

19:20.627 --> 19:22.193
yet he's not seen

19:23.630 --> 19:24.829
my house.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.264
- But he hasn't been in it-

19:26.366 --> 19:27.265
- For a long time.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.499
- Okay.

19:28.601 --> 19:32.403
Terri talked about her
boyfriend, Kraig, of 43 years.

19:32.505 --> 19:33.871
The fact that she
bought this house

19:33.973 --> 19:35.273
and neither one of them

19:35.375 --> 19:37.275
have been able to
spend time in it,

19:37.377 --> 19:38.809
is curious to me.

19:38.912 --> 19:39.977
So why don't we step outside?

19:40.079 --> 19:40.878
- Okay.

19:40.980 --> 19:44.048
(suspenseful music)

19:46.252 --> 19:48.219
- I see that Kraig

19:49.622 --> 19:53.324
and Peggy are walking up.
- Oh, my.

19:53.426 --> 19:54.458
- Hello.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.260
- Hello.
- Hi there, Kraig.

19:56.362 --> 19:57.395
Hi Peggy.

19:58.398 --> 19:59.497
This is Kraig.

19:59.599 --> 20:00.598
- Hi Kraig.

20:05.939 --> 20:08.673
Kraig, we were just talking
about how important you are.

20:08.775 --> 20:12.043
- You know that I love you
more than I love my stuff.

20:13.246 --> 20:14.278
- Yeah, I guess.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.346
- You guess?

20:17.050 --> 20:18.182
- Um, yeah.

20:24.157 --> 20:26.724
(Suspenseful music)

20:37.904 --> 20:39.337
- Kraig has felt

20:39.439 --> 20:41.872
that she does love her stuff

20:41.975 --> 20:43.874
more than she loves him.

20:43.977 --> 20:45.276
Hello.

20:45.378 --> 20:48.112
That has not been
the impression

20:48.214 --> 20:50.081
that she's wanting
to give to Kraig.

20:51.751 --> 20:52.683
Kraig, we were
just talking about

20:52.785 --> 20:55.886
how there's been times
where you have felt

20:55.989 --> 20:59.690
that her stuff is more
important than you.

20:59.792 --> 21:01.325
- Yes, it's just all

21:01.427 --> 21:02.793
the time and money.
- It's just-

21:02.895 --> 21:03.894
- Hang on, hang on,

21:03.997 --> 21:05.029
listen to what he has
to say. Say it, say it.

21:05.131 --> 21:08.799
- Well, just all the
time and money and,

21:08.901 --> 21:11.335
you know, that you
devote to this,

21:11.437 --> 21:14.705
it seems like we could be
doing other things together.

21:16.175 --> 21:16.974
- We'll be able to.

21:18.211 --> 21:19.810
- Yes, I look forward to that.

21:19.912 --> 21:23.714
I've always believed that
there was something better

21:23.816 --> 21:28.619
that, you know, a better way
to get along and survive.

21:29.389 --> 21:32.089
We've lost lots of opportunities

21:32.191 --> 21:36.193
to do the things
that couples do.

21:36.296 --> 21:39.797
So that's been a
great frustration.

21:39.899 --> 21:42.366
- Terri, is it hard
for you to hear that?

21:42.468 --> 21:44.268
- I mean, it hurts to think that

21:46.873 --> 21:48.506
we're not there,

21:49.309 --> 21:51.175
but we're here, you know?

21:52.412 --> 21:54.745
- You have an
opportunity to get there

21:54.847 --> 21:55.413
- [Kraig] Uh huh.

21:55.615 --> 21:56.881
- and get away from here.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.182
- Uh huh.

21:58.284 --> 22:02.019
- Because we have the manpower

22:02.121 --> 22:04.789
and we have the family
support to make this happen.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.124
Kraig is truly a rock

22:07.226 --> 22:10.227
and a strong influence
in Terri's life.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.596
I think his support
is going to be

22:12.699 --> 22:15.433
one of the greatest
factors that we have

22:15.535 --> 22:16.667
to get this job done.

22:18.304 --> 22:21.339
When was the last time
you've been in this house?

22:21.441 --> 22:23.441
- About five or six
years ago, I believe.

22:23.543 --> 22:26.043
- Peggy, when was the last
time you were in the house?

22:26.145 --> 22:27.478
- It's been about 15 years.

22:28.348 --> 22:29.213
- 15 years?

22:29.315 --> 22:30.281
- Uh huh.
- Okay.

22:31.117 --> 22:32.316
- Terri?
- Yes?

22:33.453 --> 22:36.554
- I think there's no better
time than the present

22:36.656 --> 22:40.358
to let them get a sense
of what's going on inside.

22:40.460 --> 22:41.325
Can we do that?
- Well,

22:41.427 --> 22:44.028
it's unbelievable, so
- Let's do that.

22:44.130 --> 22:45.730
It's not going to
be unbelievable.

22:45.832 --> 22:48.032
- Well, it's been
unbelievable for me,

22:48.134 --> 22:50.634
and I know that it was

22:51.537 --> 22:53.070
me that did it, so

22:53.172 --> 22:55.439
- Yes, it's a little bit
unbelievable that you did that,

22:55.541 --> 22:57.808
but it won't, it's
not unbelievable

22:57.910 --> 22:59.110
that it's all right here.

22:59.212 --> 23:02.680
I mean, I can see with my
own eyes what you've done, so.

23:04.016 --> 23:08.219
- It's a pretty narrow
pathway and be safe

23:08.321 --> 23:09.520
and I'll see you
when you come out.

23:09.622 --> 23:10.588
- Okey dokey.
- Okay?

23:10.690 --> 23:13.357
(ominous music)

23:14.594 --> 23:16.127
- Well, gee whiz.

23:18.197 --> 23:20.097
More crowded than I

23:20.199 --> 23:23.367
recall it being the last five
years ago or six years ago.

23:23.469 --> 23:24.668
- Holy crap, okay.

23:24.771 --> 23:27.772
- Yeah, golly.

23:27.874 --> 23:31.675
It's overwhelming to walk
into Terri's house now

23:31.778 --> 23:34.211
and it's just overwhelming.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.648
There's just so much stuff.

23:39.685 --> 23:42.920
- I can't see anybody living
in this, it's just like-

23:43.022 --> 23:44.855
- It's just way
- I know what it was like

23:44.957 --> 23:46.991
15 years ago.
- way more.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.693
- It makes me mad
that it's like this.

23:49.796 --> 23:52.863
I don't know, I'm sorry,

23:52.965 --> 23:54.432
I just don't know what to say.

23:55.735 --> 23:56.867
I don't, I,

23:56.969 --> 23:57.735
it's a mess.

23:59.305 --> 24:00.838
- I think I've seen enough.

24:09.015 --> 24:10.047
- Hello.

24:10.149 --> 24:11.749
- Hello.

24:11.851 --> 24:13.551
I'm fine, Peggy,
thank you very much.

24:13.653 --> 24:16.086
Just being able to lean helps.

24:16.189 --> 24:17.621
- So, I guess you're
getting a good sense

24:17.723 --> 24:19.390
of why she's called us here.

24:19.492 --> 24:20.691
- Big time.

24:20.793 --> 24:23.160
- Peggy, what were
your impressions?

24:23.262 --> 24:25.763
- It doesn't make any
sense to me, you know, so-

24:25.865 --> 24:28.165
- I think we can just
call it what it is

24:28.267 --> 24:32.102
and say, "Yes, it
doesn't make any sense."

24:32.205 --> 24:35.139
However, if we can understand

24:35.241 --> 24:38.476
it wasn't an intentional,
"I want to fill my home up

24:38.578 --> 24:40.578
with as much stuff as we can."

24:40.680 --> 24:44.448
There are things that have led

24:44.550 --> 24:48.352
to the excessive
acquisition of stock,

24:49.589 --> 24:50.554
okay?

24:50.656 --> 24:53.791
And oftentimes it can be
grief, it can be loss,

24:53.893 --> 24:58.362
it can be trauma, it can
be any number of things.

24:58.464 --> 25:01.765
And we've started
to just kind of

25:01.868 --> 25:04.702
dance around that a little bit.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.470
And over the next couple days,

25:06.572 --> 25:09.907
I'm going to work with Terri
to go a little bit deeper,

25:10.009 --> 25:14.311
to help her better
understand why this happened.

25:14.413 --> 25:16.046
And Kraig, from you,

25:16.148 --> 25:19.216
you can sit on a chair, and
that's all we need from you

25:19.318 --> 25:22.720
because just your
presence means so much.

25:22.822 --> 25:23.754
- Thank you.

25:23.856 --> 25:24.755
- Missed you, dear.

25:26.325 --> 25:27.324
- I'm showing you
- I'll be here for you.

25:27.426 --> 25:30.027
- what I've been behind
and not showing you.

25:31.297 --> 25:33.531
- I know there's
great things to come.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.399
That's how I've always felt.

25:35.501 --> 25:38.435
(emotional music)

25:50.249 --> 25:52.917
(knocking)

25:53.019 --> 25:54.151
- Hi, Terri?
- Hi.

25:54.253 --> 25:55.119
Hi.
- Hi, Cory.

25:55.221 --> 25:55.786
How are you?

25:55.888 --> 25:56.754
- Good and yourself?

25:56.856 --> 25:58.289
- I'm okay, nice to meet you.

25:58.391 --> 25:59.256
- Good.

25:59.358 --> 26:01.325
- I'm Cory Chalmers,
an extreme cleaner

26:01.427 --> 26:04.628
that specializes in biohazard
and hoarding cleanup.

26:04.730 --> 26:05.763
I was just over at your house.

26:05.865 --> 26:06.664
- Uh huh.

26:06.766 --> 26:07.898
- Taking a look
around, but I hear

26:08.000 --> 26:08.699
there might be some issues here

26:08.801 --> 26:09.700
that you need help with, too.

26:09.802 --> 26:11.001
- Yes.
- Okay, well lets-

26:11.103 --> 26:12.469
So, I just visited
Terri's house,

26:12.572 --> 26:13.537
and it's not a huge house,

26:13.639 --> 26:15.539
but it is really full of stuff.

26:15.641 --> 26:17.708
I mean, there is no
functionality whatsoever,

26:17.810 --> 26:19.476
so I'm not surprised
she's not living there,

26:19.579 --> 26:21.745
or the fact that the
city has condemned it.

26:21.847 --> 26:22.580
- Roy?

26:22.682 --> 26:23.380
- Yes.

26:23.482 --> 26:24.682
- This is Cory.

26:24.784 --> 26:25.649
- Hi, Roy.

26:25.751 --> 26:26.984
- And Cory is
- Nice to meet you.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.218
- One of
- Shake that way,

26:28.321 --> 26:30.220
be safe.
- the cleanup guys.

26:30.323 --> 26:30.955
- Okay.

26:31.057 --> 26:32.256
- Yeah, how are you feeling

26:32.358 --> 26:34.658
about the stuff
that's come here.

26:40.266 --> 26:42.032
- Well, we'll work on
that part of it, too,

26:42.134 --> 26:43.100
cause you have to be able

26:43.202 --> 26:46.170
to communicate while
we're here, okay.

26:46.272 --> 26:47.471
But our goal, obviously,

26:47.573 --> 26:49.406
is to get your house cleaned up,

26:49.508 --> 26:51.508
but then we want to
also address this.

26:52.645 --> 26:54.511
So that's going to mean
some fast decisions

26:54.614 --> 26:55.446
over there at your place.

26:55.548 --> 26:56.614
- Sure, sure.
- Cause we want to spend

26:56.716 --> 26:58.482
some time here to
make Roy's house safe.

26:58.584 --> 26:59.550
He deserves that.

27:00.886 --> 27:02.319
- Absolutely.

27:02.421 --> 27:03.454
So, tell me kind of a little bit

27:03.556 --> 27:04.622
about what's been going on.

27:04.724 --> 27:06.857
Can you not stay at your
place because it's so full?

27:06.959 --> 27:08.125
Or how did you end up over here?

27:08.227 --> 27:13.497
- Well, I was working here
before with two other caregivers

27:15.434 --> 27:20.270
and they left at
the end of February.

27:21.641 --> 27:22.940
- So you became his
full-time live in caretaker?

27:23.042 --> 27:24.708
- Yes, yes.

27:24.810 --> 27:28.545
All of a sudden with
the virus and just,

27:28.648 --> 27:31.982
it was like a
snowball of issues.

27:32.084 --> 27:33.684
- So physically you're
taking care of him,

27:33.786 --> 27:35.853
but the house is not helping.

27:35.955 --> 27:36.954
I'm sure, you'll
agree with that.

27:37.056 --> 27:37.988
- Yes, yes.
- Right?

27:38.090 --> 27:41.191
What stuff in here is
yours versus Roy's?

27:42.161 --> 27:43.360
- All of it's hers?

27:44.930 --> 27:47.097
- I can see that (giggles)

27:47.199 --> 27:50.801
- This is mine, the
boxes underneath.

27:50.903 --> 27:51.935
This right here.

27:52.038 --> 27:54.104
- Uh huh, as a caretaker,

27:54.206 --> 27:55.606
- Uh huh?
- that's not good.

27:55.708 --> 27:56.640
He deserves a lot
- Well, and I-

27:56.742 --> 27:57.241
- more than that.

27:57.343 --> 27:58.175
- Sure.
- Okay?

27:58.277 --> 28:00.077
- I mean, I'm ashamed of it.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.278
- Well, let's take
full advantage

28:01.380 --> 28:02.579
of the time that we're here

28:02.682 --> 28:03.747
- Okay?

28:03.849 --> 28:04.848
- so that you're
not ashamed of it.

28:04.950 --> 28:06.283
And let's try to work on
changing the behavior,

28:06.385 --> 28:08.218
not just removing stuff.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.220
What else in this
house is yours?

28:10.322 --> 28:14.591
The basement is full,
down the hallway.

28:14.694 --> 28:16.694
I have two bedrooms that

28:16.796 --> 28:19.129
- Okay.
- I put things in, so.

28:19.231 --> 28:21.832
(ominous music)

28:30.209 --> 28:33.310
- After seeing Roy's house,
the condition is to a point

28:33.412 --> 28:35.646
where we have to make
it safe and livable.

28:35.748 --> 28:36.780
In the few days that we have,

28:36.882 --> 28:38.449
we can only spend a couple
days at Terri's house

28:38.551 --> 28:41.618
because now we have to get over
to Roy's to make that safe.

28:41.721 --> 28:42.586
I don't want to put
more pressure on you,

28:42.688 --> 28:43.787
but I want you to know

28:43.889 --> 28:46.757
that you could possibly
get charged with neglect.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.692
You're supposed to
be his caretaker,

28:48.794 --> 28:51.395
and when someone comes in
and sees the house like this,

28:51.497 --> 28:52.863
you're not being a caretaker,

28:52.965 --> 28:54.398
you're causing more issues here.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.600
So, I want to tell you that

28:56.702 --> 28:58.969
because I want that
to help you realize

28:59.071 --> 29:01.071
the importance of
getting your house done

29:01.173 --> 29:03.340
and then getting over here
to get this mess cleaned up.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.008
You have to let things go.

29:12.752 --> 29:15.018
(suspenseful music)

29:20.059 --> 29:23.494
(forklift reverse beeping)

29:26.098 --> 29:29.933
- I hope that Terri
will have the courage

29:30.035 --> 29:33.570
and the strength to just
walk away from everything

29:33.672 --> 29:37.908
and let it go, and move in with
Kraig and they get married.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.343
That would be ideal.

29:39.445 --> 29:42.513
(suspenseful music)

29:48.587 --> 29:50.087
- It's the first day,
first thing we want to do

29:50.189 --> 29:52.089
is call a morning
meeting and let's discuss

29:52.191 --> 29:53.891
what's going on and
what the plan is.

29:55.227 --> 29:55.793
Good morning, everyone.

29:55.895 --> 29:57.494
- [Crowd] Good morning.

29:57.596 --> 29:59.797
- Terri, how are
you feeling today?

29:59.899 --> 30:03.801
- I have feelings of
nervousness, for sure.

30:03.903 --> 30:06.737
I'll take it a step at a time,

30:06.839 --> 30:08.038
a piece at a time.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.573
- Yeah, and thank you for that

30:09.675 --> 30:12.609
because this is going
to be very difficult,

30:12.711 --> 30:14.444
and right now is
probably the easiest part

30:14.547 --> 30:15.746
because we haven't
done anything.

30:15.848 --> 30:16.914
- [Terri] Uh huh.

30:17.016 --> 30:19.983
- And it's going to be
really challenging for you.

30:20.085 --> 30:21.718
And while what's to happen

30:21.821 --> 30:24.021
is going to be very
anxiety producing,

30:24.123 --> 30:26.757
it's also going
to produce change.

30:26.859 --> 30:31.762
There is this man next
to you, of 43 years,

30:32.898 --> 30:35.866
who loves and adores
you beyond words

30:35.968 --> 30:37.401
in the English dictionary.

30:38.437 --> 30:39.336
- He's a sweetheart.

30:39.438 --> 30:41.805
- Yeah and here he is,

30:43.142 --> 30:47.044
right, glued by your side
practically, to support you.

30:47.146 --> 30:51.348
And he's never been able
to share this home with you

30:51.450 --> 30:52.983
because from the
day you bought it,

30:53.085 --> 30:54.451
it became a storage unit.

30:54.553 --> 30:55.252
- Yes.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.253
- Right?

30:56.355 --> 30:57.721
Kraig, I want to
send it over to you.

30:57.823 --> 30:59.590
How are you feeling?

30:59.692 --> 31:01.491
- I'm thrilled,
I'm really excited

31:01.594 --> 31:07.564
that Terri has taken these
steps to correct things.

31:07.666 --> 31:09.900
Beyond words, I'm thrilled.

31:11.036 --> 31:11.735
- Alright.

31:11.837 --> 31:13.637
So Cheryl, how are you feeling?

31:14.740 --> 31:16.506
- I'm feeling very
happy for her.

31:16.609 --> 31:17.908
That and all your
friends are here

31:18.010 --> 31:18.742
- I know, I know.

31:18.844 --> 31:20.043
- to make this happen

31:20.145 --> 31:22.479
and I truly believe
that, you know,

31:22.581 --> 31:23.847
when you ask, you get answers,

31:23.949 --> 31:25.415
and this is her big answer.

31:25.517 --> 31:28.485
And even though it's
going to be rough on you,

31:28.587 --> 31:29.486
we're all here for you.

31:29.588 --> 31:30.787
- I know, thank you.

31:30.890 --> 31:32.589
- And Kathy.

31:32.691 --> 31:34.458
- I'm really excited
for you, Terri.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.861
We've waited for this moment
for so long, you know.

31:37.963 --> 31:38.962
- Thanks, Kathy.

31:39.064 --> 31:41.765
- I'm so happy for you
and happy for Kraig, too,

31:41.867 --> 31:42.733
for both of you.

31:44.470 --> 31:49.239
- So we've got your family,
we've got Kraig's family,

31:49.341 --> 31:51.475
and you're getting teary.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.110
- Uh huh.
- What's coming up for you?

31:53.212 --> 31:57.681
- Just that I'm
sensitive and happy.

31:57.783 --> 32:00.350
I mean they're happy tears, so,

32:00.452 --> 32:04.021
- Well, we're all here
for you today, okay?

32:04.123 --> 32:06.490
So we're going to
turn it over to Cory

32:06.592 --> 32:08.425
so he can talk about the plan.

32:08.527 --> 32:09.192
- Okay?

32:09.295 --> 32:12.329
- Okay, you have a few crises,

32:12.431 --> 32:14.932
one being the city has
condemned to your house, right?

32:15.034 --> 32:15.999
- Right.
- And so the goal is

32:16.101 --> 32:18.602
to get that lifted and
get you back in here.

32:18.704 --> 32:21.605
Another crisis is, we have
to get over to Roy's house,

32:21.707 --> 32:23.106
- Uh huh.
- And address

32:23.208 --> 32:24.841
the concerns there, so
that he has a safe house.

32:24.944 --> 32:26.843
- Uh huh.
- But to do that

32:26.946 --> 32:28.145
in a few days,
that's going to take

32:28.247 --> 32:30.247
some very fast
decisions on your part.

32:30.349 --> 32:31.181
- Uh huh.

32:32.151 --> 32:33.250
- So, what I'd like
to start with today

32:33.352 --> 32:35.919
is if we could clear
out the backyard here

32:36.021 --> 32:38.555
so that we can have a
sorting area, triaging area,

32:38.657 --> 32:40.691
- Uh huh.
- then we can bring stuff out.

32:40.793 --> 32:43.493
Organizers will help set it
up so that you can see it all.

32:43.595 --> 32:44.761
- Uh huh.
- And I think

32:44.863 --> 32:47.030
if we can start
real quick out here

32:47.132 --> 32:48.231
and make some fast decisions,

32:48.334 --> 32:49.800
this will give us
the room we need

32:49.902 --> 32:51.668
to start bringing
stuff out of the home.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.804
Does that sound like
something you can do?

32:56.275 --> 32:57.207
- I'll try.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.376
- Okay, so you guys
ready to get started?

32:59.478 --> 33:00.610
- Ready.
- Yup.

33:00.713 --> 33:02.012
- Alright, let's
work on this pile.

33:02.114 --> 33:05.115
(crowd murmuring)

33:05.217 --> 33:06.583
- Alright, you guys.

33:06.685 --> 33:07.751
So, we need some
quick decisions.

33:07.853 --> 33:10.320
Out of all this stuff that
we're looking at here,

33:10.422 --> 33:12.723
is there stuff that you
know you want to keep?

33:14.626 --> 33:16.493
Is it all trash?

33:16.595 --> 33:20.597
- I like her all five chairs,
if those can be keepers?

33:20.699 --> 33:22.699
- I want to keep pushing
back just a little bit.

33:22.801 --> 33:25.302
You have thousands of
projects that you want to do.

33:25.404 --> 33:26.069
- Right.

33:26.171 --> 33:27.437
- Is this a realistic project?

33:27.539 --> 33:28.538
- Put them in the
scrap pile, Terri.

33:28.640 --> 33:29.306
- Uh.

33:29.975 --> 33:32.109
- Terri, you can't do that.

33:34.847 --> 33:37.547
You gotta get rid of
things, Terri darling.

33:37.649 --> 33:39.983
- What's your fear,
of them ending up

33:40.085 --> 33:43.153
in a recycling center, in a bin?

33:44.823 --> 33:46.323
What do you see
that we don't see?

33:46.425 --> 33:47.991
I see old rusty chairs.

33:48.861 --> 33:50.394
- There's character there.

33:50.496 --> 33:53.663
Just even the patina, the rust.

33:53.766 --> 33:55.932
- This is my worry, is
we're already getting

33:56.035 --> 33:58.869
hung up on things and we're
only talking about things

33:58.971 --> 34:01.204
that are dilapidated
by rain, weather.

34:01.306 --> 34:01.972
- Right.

34:02.074 --> 34:03.106
- When we get into your house,

34:03.208 --> 34:05.075
the decisions are
gonna be much harder.

34:05.177 --> 34:07.544
- If they were set
over to the side,

34:07.646 --> 34:08.812
I'd like to keep

34:08.914 --> 34:10.080
- Okay, so let's do this,
- these two.

34:10.182 --> 34:11.248
let's set these
three to the side

34:11.350 --> 34:12.215
and let's move on for now.

34:12.317 --> 34:13.550
- Okay.
- Okay,

34:13.652 --> 34:15.619
so this one's
going to be a keep.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.654
This is a keep, and
this you want to keep?

34:17.756 --> 34:18.455
- Yes.

34:19.992 --> 34:21.992
I want to keep that for sure,

34:22.094 --> 34:23.326
that there.
- Okay.

34:23.429 --> 34:25.328
- And maybe one table.

34:25.431 --> 34:28.532
- Well, which one would you
like out of these three?

34:28.634 --> 34:31.101
- Well, I want that one.

34:31.203 --> 34:33.236
- Okay, what about
these shelves?

34:33.338 --> 34:34.104
- Yes.
- I'm assuming they go

34:34.206 --> 34:35.372
with that.
- this goes with this

34:35.474 --> 34:36.306
and I want to keep that.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.308
- Alright, what about
this marble top?

34:38.410 --> 34:39.643
- I'd like to keep that, too.

34:39.745 --> 34:40.777
- Does it go to something?

34:42.948 --> 34:45.248
- It goes to something,
but I don't know.

34:46.151 --> 34:47.150
- The first few
things that we touched

34:47.252 --> 34:49.219
in this backyard is
a little concerning.

34:49.321 --> 34:51.188
She's wanting to save
a bunch of rusty chairs

34:51.290 --> 34:53.790
and some tables; things
aren't looking so well.

34:53.892 --> 34:56.059
So, I'm hoping that we
can talk her through this

34:56.161 --> 34:57.360
and then we can
pick up speed again,

34:57.463 --> 34:58.595
making much better decisions.

35:00.532 --> 35:02.065
How are you feeling? Is this
harder than you thought?

35:02.167 --> 35:03.733
Do you feel rushed?
- I was going to say

35:03.836 --> 35:05.635
I feel rushed, for sure.

35:05.737 --> 35:07.337
- You see, like we're
all standing around,

35:07.439 --> 35:08.338
- Uh huh.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.373
- waiting for you to
tell us what to do.

35:10.476 --> 35:12.409
Is there any way to
speed this process up

35:12.511 --> 35:14.177
with other people
that you trust?

35:15.114 --> 35:16.146
- Um.

35:16.248 --> 35:17.848
And if the answer is,
"No", the answer is, "No".

35:17.950 --> 35:19.483
- Yeah.
- So I just need to know

35:19.585 --> 35:22.919
if you would trust
anyone to make decisions,

35:23.021 --> 35:24.721
just like you are, going
through everything,

35:24.823 --> 35:28.325
so we could speed this
up a little bit faster

35:28.427 --> 35:29.559
because if you go
through and have to,

35:29.661 --> 35:31.728
if you have to touch every
single thing in this house,

35:31.830 --> 35:33.196
you know how long
that's going to take.

35:33.298 --> 35:34.831
- Right.
- We'd be here weeks.

35:34.933 --> 35:35.866
- I know.

35:35.968 --> 35:37.834
And that wouldn't even
include Roy's house.

35:39.538 --> 35:40.337
- I don't know.

35:40.439 --> 35:43.607
I mean, I just

35:43.709 --> 35:45.475
- If this box went right now,

35:45.577 --> 35:46.810
- Uh huh.

35:46.912 --> 35:48.745
- And you didn't know what was
in it, what would the loss be

35:48.847 --> 35:50.580
if you don't even
know what's in it?

35:52.050 --> 35:53.550
Even something like this,
if that got thrown away,

35:53.652 --> 35:55.385
would that be the
end of the world?

35:55.487 --> 35:56.353
- No.

35:56.455 --> 35:58.088
- Is anything over
there that you kept,

35:58.190 --> 35:59.723
- Uh huh?
- The end of the world

35:59.825 --> 36:01.091
if it didn't get saved?

36:01.960 --> 36:03.026
- Um.

36:03.128 --> 36:04.161
- If you open your front door

36:04.263 --> 36:05.428
and you have a very clean house

36:05.531 --> 36:08.598
and the city says, "Great job,
you have your house back."

36:08.700 --> 36:09.699
- Uh huh?

36:09.801 --> 36:11.468
- Is that worth any of
this stuff going away

36:11.570 --> 36:14.571
and you not seeing it or
making those hard decisions

36:14.673 --> 36:16.673
that are slowing
us down so much?

36:16.775 --> 36:17.641
- I mean, that's ha-.

36:17.743 --> 36:18.975
It's really ha-

36:19.077 --> 36:20.911
I mean, it's hard.

36:21.013 --> 36:22.946
- It is hard, it's very hard.

36:23.048 --> 36:24.848
And that's why you
haven't done it.

36:24.950 --> 36:26.650
At this point, Terri is
going to have to speed up

36:26.752 --> 36:28.118
and make a lot faster decisions,

36:28.220 --> 36:29.586
or we are never going to
get through this house

36:29.688 --> 36:32.088
in a couple of days and
get over to Roy's house.

36:39.164 --> 36:41.698
(suspenseful music)

36:49.141 --> 36:51.341
- This is a keep, and
this one you want to keep?

36:51.443 --> 36:54.110
- Yes, these are keep
and that's trash.

36:54.213 --> 36:55.278
- Okay.

36:55.380 --> 36:56.213
- Terri, don't go
through all of it

36:56.315 --> 36:57.747
Like donate and stuff.

36:57.849 --> 37:00.050
- Can't donate broken,
filthy things, so.

37:07.092 --> 37:09.226
- I mean, Kraig, I'm sorry.

37:09.328 --> 37:10.860
- Why are you sorry?

37:10.963 --> 37:13.663
- Well, just because
he's frustrated with me.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.298
- He deserves to be frustrated.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.734
He's waited 40 something
years to have just you

37:17.836 --> 37:20.136
and he's fighting this
stuff to have you, right?

37:20.239 --> 37:24.107
I mean, would you care if
any of this stuff was gone?

37:24.209 --> 37:25.342
- Not really.

37:25.444 --> 37:27.477
No, not hardly.

37:27.579 --> 37:28.712
- Come on in doc.

37:30.716 --> 37:32.415
- Alright, so what's
going on, Terri?

37:32.517 --> 37:33.350
- We're going through boxes

37:33.452 --> 37:35.819
to get stuff like
this out, to donate.

37:35.921 --> 37:37.921
And I said, "You don't
even know what's in here.

37:38.023 --> 37:40.523
"So if that box
was just to leave,

37:40.626 --> 37:41.825
how would that affect
you negatively?"

37:41.927 --> 37:43.493
- I think the point
that Cory's making

37:43.595 --> 37:45.061
is you're going to have
to pick up the pace

37:45.163 --> 37:46.630
because you guys
have been out here

37:46.732 --> 37:50.333
almost a half hour now, just
to try to clear a space,

37:50.435 --> 37:53.236
to make space to be
able to make decisions.

37:53.338 --> 37:54.871
- Terri, look through
that stuff right there

37:54.973 --> 37:56.940
and just see if anything
you can't live without.

37:57.042 --> 37:59.309
Let's get these people
busy moving things.

38:00.679 --> 38:02.212
- So Kraig wants
you to go over here

38:02.314 --> 38:03.980
and do quick scan and
see if there's anything

38:04.082 --> 38:04.614
that you want to keep.

38:04.716 --> 38:05.815
Come on over, Kraig.

38:06.818 --> 38:09.552
First, is there anything
that you want, Kraig?

38:09.655 --> 38:10.320
- No.

38:10.422 --> 38:12.289
- These tools, just let them go?

38:12.391 --> 38:14.624
- Yeah, let them go, Terri.
Their old and those aren't good.

38:14.726 --> 38:17.394
- That's alright, I'll
look at them later.

38:18.063 --> 38:19.763
Some of it is trash?

38:19.865 --> 38:21.031
- Throw the trash away.

38:22.668 --> 38:24.334
- Is this trash here?

38:24.436 --> 38:25.769
- [Cleaner] Yup.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.143
- I did okay.

38:33.245 --> 38:36.413
That was quick, slow
but quick for me.

38:36.515 --> 38:39.482
- Not slowly, but not quick.

38:39.584 --> 38:40.483
You're doing a good job.

38:40.585 --> 38:43.253
- With a little push,
help from Kraig,

38:43.355 --> 38:45.355
she's making much better
decisions in the backyard.

38:45.457 --> 38:46.523
We're going to have
plenty of room now

38:46.625 --> 38:47.857
to get the ball rolling.

39:02.874 --> 39:06.209
So, as you can see, we
have a lot of stuff.

39:06.311 --> 39:08.345
Put a very little
dent in your kitchen.

39:08.447 --> 39:09.479
- Cory, can I ask
you a quick question?

39:09.581 --> 39:10.947
- Uh huh?

39:11.049 --> 39:14.684
- Percentage wise, 1% of
the kitchen, 2, 3, 5, 10?

39:14.786 --> 39:16.953
- This is probably 5%, if that.

39:17.055 --> 39:19.889
- 5% of your kitchen.

39:19.991 --> 39:21.358
one, two,

39:21.460 --> 39:24.761
three, four 8' tables.

39:24.863 --> 39:25.562
- And underneath.

39:25.664 --> 39:26.296
- And underneath.

39:26.398 --> 39:28.431
That just goes to show you

39:28.533 --> 39:31.201
how densely packed
this is, okay?

39:31.303 --> 39:33.703
- And why even the 75%
number if you were to let go,

39:33.805 --> 39:36.439
you'd still have way too
much stuff for your kitchen.

39:41.012 --> 39:43.246
So, this first round that
Terri's going through,

39:43.348 --> 39:46.683
is only about 5% of the
stuff in the kitchen alone.

39:46.785 --> 39:49.452
When you multiply that
times the rest of the house,

39:49.554 --> 39:50.553
she's going to have
way too much stuff,

39:50.655 --> 39:53.289
and this house is still
going to be very full.

39:53.392 --> 39:56.326
(suspenseful music)

40:05.937 --> 40:07.804
I want to see if you can
work with your sisters,

40:07.906 --> 40:08.805
- Uh huh.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.073
- allow them to look
through this stuff,

40:10.175 --> 40:11.040
make decisions on your behalf,

40:11.143 --> 40:12.675
- Uh huh.
- and see if you would agree

40:12.778 --> 40:14.944
with their decisions
and vice versa.

40:15.046 --> 40:17.280
Okay, so I want you to
make decisions based off of

40:17.382 --> 40:19.215
how she needs to
live in the future.

40:19.317 --> 40:20.984
And then remember, speed
is kind of important,

40:21.086 --> 40:22.652
you guys, cause we
got to get moving.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.888
Just hold it up and say,
"Donate, discard, keep."

40:24.990 --> 40:26.055
- Okay.
- Okay.

40:26.158 --> 40:27.023
- Okay.

40:27.125 --> 40:28.658
- Donate.
- Donate.

40:28.760 --> 40:29.726
- Donate.
- Keep.

40:30.529 --> 40:31.361
- Donate.

40:32.998 --> 40:34.030
Donate.

40:34.132 --> 40:35.331
- Keep.

40:35.434 --> 40:36.800
- That's a donate?
- This is a keep.

40:36.902 --> 40:37.600
- Donate.

40:37.702 --> 40:38.435
- Uh huh.

40:38.537 --> 40:39.235
- Donate.

40:39.337 --> 40:40.904
- This is candles. This is-

40:41.006 --> 40:42.305
- Wait, over here.
- Over here.

40:42.407 --> 40:45.575
(crowd murmuring)

40:45.677 --> 40:47.577
- Here's for trash unless
she wants to keep it?

40:47.679 --> 40:48.678
- And this is a-

40:48.780 --> 40:49.646
- Donate
- art project here,

40:49.748 --> 40:51.281
that I'm done with.

40:51.383 --> 40:52.715
- Donate.
- No.

40:52.818 --> 40:54.717
- Terri is ready to go.

40:54.820 --> 40:56.986
She's got her
sisters in and she's

40:57.088 --> 41:00.723
able to delegate and let
them make some decisions.

41:00.826 --> 41:02.358
She's trusting their judgment

41:02.461 --> 41:04.828
and she's not
micromanaging them,

41:04.930 --> 41:08.565
which is very unusual in
these types of situations.

41:08.667 --> 41:10.667
- Did you need to see this?
- Donate, that's all right.

41:10.769 --> 41:12.602
No, no, no, that's okay.

41:12.704 --> 41:14.103
- And donate.

41:14.206 --> 41:14.971
- So, this is trash.

41:18.443 --> 41:19.809
- Okay. So let's
just stop right here.

41:19.911 --> 41:21.277
- Uh huh.
- Okay?

41:21.379 --> 41:22.745
How did your sisters do?

41:22.848 --> 41:23.913
First table clear?

41:24.950 --> 41:26.149
Did they make any bad decisions?

41:26.251 --> 41:27.650
- Peggy, you did amazing, yeah.

41:27.752 --> 41:28.251
- No.

41:28.353 --> 41:29.619
- No bad decisions?

41:29.721 --> 41:32.489
- Well, I just kept one thing
that Peggy said to donate,

41:32.591 --> 41:33.790
so,
- Okay, so this is

41:33.892 --> 41:35.492
that exercise on trust,

41:35.594 --> 41:36.759
- Uh huh.
- and it seemed to work

41:36.862 --> 41:37.393
pretty well.

41:37.496 --> 41:38.561
- Uh huh.

41:38.663 --> 41:40.296
- So again, if you trust
them with their own table,

41:40.398 --> 41:41.798
we can keep doing this.

41:41.900 --> 41:45.368
So, to do that, we need
to split up in teams.

41:45.470 --> 41:46.836
- So Peggy at one table,

41:46.938 --> 41:48.104
- One table.
- Cheryl at another, yeah.

41:48.206 --> 41:50.306
- Then we can start loading
all the donate stuff up.

41:55.146 --> 41:56.145
- Great, Cheryl.

41:56.248 --> 41:58.314
- That was awesome.

42:02.420 --> 42:03.753
- I'll take that box.

42:03.855 --> 42:05.989
We could use a smaller
box here, thank you.

42:08.293 --> 42:09.526
- This is a donate.

42:10.729 --> 42:12.529
- [Robin] Need
another donate box!

42:15.467 --> 42:17.734
- Where's Kraig there?
= Need more stuff, guys!

42:25.544 --> 42:27.443
- You can donate that.

42:30.148 --> 42:30.880
- This is donate?

42:30.982 --> 42:31.848
- Yup.

42:38.757 --> 42:40.423
- Terri was working really hard

42:40.525 --> 42:42.292
and I could tell she
was getting physically

42:42.394 --> 42:43.860
and emotionally exhausted.

42:43.962 --> 42:47.463
And I knew this was the
moment to call in Kraig.

42:47.566 --> 42:48.865
Can you give her a big hug?

42:48.967 --> 42:50.833
She needs it right now.

42:50.936 --> 42:51.901
- And she deserves it.

42:52.003 --> 42:54.637
- And she deserves it,
she's worked so hard.

43:04.816 --> 43:06.482
- You're doing great, Terri.

43:06.585 --> 43:09.619
It's going to be so awesome to

43:11.823 --> 43:13.156
to have an art studio
here, you know,

43:13.258 --> 43:16.326
and have a kitchen
here and a living spot

43:16.428 --> 43:17.927
and a bedroom.

43:18.797 --> 43:20.063
It's going to be fabulous.

43:20.165 --> 43:21.497
(Terri giggles)

43:21.600 --> 43:22.899
It sounds like a
dream come true.

43:30.375 --> 43:33.409
(suspenseful music)

43:42.120 --> 43:43.620
- Now we're just waiting
around for Terri.

43:43.722 --> 43:44.621
I don't know if
she's coming or not,

43:44.723 --> 43:45.788
but our guys are
all standing around

43:45.890 --> 43:47.724
and this is the
one day that we had

43:47.826 --> 43:48.691
to get her house done

43:48.793 --> 43:50.727
so we could get over
to Roy's tomorrow.

43:53.832 --> 43:55.832
- At this point, I
have to call Terri

43:55.934 --> 43:57.667
and find out where she is.

43:57.769 --> 43:59.402
If we're going to get
her house cleaned up,

43:59.504 --> 44:02.739
she has to be here and
we're losing valuable time.

44:02.841 --> 44:04.407
(phone ringing)

44:13.251 --> 44:15.518
(suspenseful music)

44:21.059 --> 44:24.260
- Six years ago,
Code Enforcement came

44:26.431 --> 44:29.198
and told me I could
not live in this house.

44:35.740 --> 44:38.341
You know that I love you
more than I love my stuff.

44:38.443 --> 44:39.542
- Yeah, I guess.

44:39.644 --> 44:40.710
- You guess?

44:44.983 --> 44:46.382
- We have to get
Roy's house safe.

44:46.484 --> 44:47.984
So, we're going to spend
probably a couple days

44:48.086 --> 44:50.153
at Terri's house and then
we have to get to Roy's

44:50.255 --> 44:52.255
to make that a much
safer home for him.

44:56.094 --> 44:57.593
If this box
disappeared right now

44:57.696 --> 44:58.294
and you didn't get the
chance to look through it,

44:58.396 --> 45:00.196
what would be the loss?

45:00.298 --> 45:01.164
- I mean, that's ha-

45:01.266 --> 45:02.331
It's really ha-

45:02.434 --> 45:04.033
I mean-

45:18.349 --> 45:21.384
- We have lost an
entire morning.

45:21.486 --> 45:24.487
We have a crew of 20+ people

45:24.589 --> 45:27.256
who are standing
around to help Terri,

45:27.358 --> 45:29.726
and she's the only
one that isn't here.

45:43.141 --> 45:43.840
- Hi, Terri.

45:43.942 --> 45:45.608
- Hello.
- Good morning, Terri.

45:46.711 --> 45:48.444
Hey, let's go find a
private place to talk.

45:48.546 --> 45:49.445
- Okay?

45:49.547 --> 45:50.980
- Let's check in with you.

45:51.783 --> 45:53.316
I have to check in with Terri

45:53.418 --> 45:56.185
and find out what is going on.

45:57.055 --> 45:58.321
- Come on over.

45:58.423 --> 45:59.689
- What happened, Terri?

45:59.791 --> 46:03.593
- It's, I left here last night.

46:03.695 --> 46:05.862
Kraig's in the truck
with me saying,

46:05.964 --> 46:08.931
"Terri, do you think you can
put some pride in your house

46:09.033 --> 46:10.099
"once this is over?"

46:10.201 --> 46:14.971
And I'm thinking, "How
much can I do at one time?"

46:15.073 --> 46:17.406
Put some pride in
whatever I'm doing?

46:17.509 --> 46:19.575
Don't say this to me right now!

46:20.912 --> 46:25.181
I just went through this day
dealing with all of this!

46:26.651 --> 46:30.820
- Terri is so elevated, she
is having a really hard time

46:30.922 --> 46:33.723
separating and
distancing herself

46:33.825 --> 46:35.825
from all the chaos in her life.

46:35.927 --> 46:40.696
- As much as I've cared
for Roy, to care for him

46:40.799 --> 46:45.701
mentally, physically,
he depends on me

46:46.838 --> 46:48.805
and he wants me there
to hold his hand.

46:49.908 --> 46:52.441
And when I'm there and
when I'm not there,

46:52.544 --> 46:56.679
he'll tell me I can use his
car, then he tells me, "No!"

46:56.781 --> 46:59.282
And then it's like,
all of a sudden,

46:59.384 --> 47:01.117
what he said, what it wasn't!

47:01.219 --> 47:03.653
And that really upsets me!

47:03.755 --> 47:05.021
And it's just,

47:06.558 --> 47:09.125
- I can't even do
my job at this point

47:09.227 --> 47:13.296
because I'm essentially just
doing crisis management.

47:13.398 --> 47:16.232
There are so many parts
to the fire, if you will.

47:16.334 --> 47:18.835
And we've got
kerosene and gasoline

47:18.937 --> 47:20.837
being poured on it right now.

47:20.939 --> 47:23.072
And we have to
get you to a place

47:23.174 --> 47:25.708
to try to put this stuff aside

47:25.810 --> 47:27.844
because we're not going to
resolve all this right now.

47:27.946 --> 47:28.945
This is a bigger issue.

47:29.047 --> 47:34.016
- Right, this is 25 or
30 years of issues of me.

47:34.118 --> 47:37.720
I bought this stuff to try
and resell it to make money.

47:37.822 --> 47:41.457
Then I've snowballed
into caring for people,

47:41.559 --> 47:43.092
that I don't even
care for myself right.

47:43.194 --> 47:44.393
- I know, I know.

47:44.495 --> 47:46.529
And that's the place that we
want to get right now, Terri.

47:46.631 --> 47:49.765
- And to figure it out
in one week, it's hard!

47:49.868 --> 47:51.500
- It is hard, it is hard.

47:53.338 --> 47:55.705
But Cory, what do we
need to do at this point?

47:56.441 --> 47:58.875
- This was our one big push day

47:58.977 --> 48:01.010
because we have to
be at Roy's tomorrow.

48:01.112 --> 48:02.478
It's almost time
to break for lunch

48:02.580 --> 48:03.779
and we haven't even started?

48:03.882 --> 48:06.549
I'm very concerned. Are you
in a place where you can make

48:06.651 --> 48:08.851
rational decisions right now?

48:08.953 --> 48:12.288
- I'm loaded, my
plate is overloaded.

48:14.192 --> 48:15.358
- Let's do this.

48:15.460 --> 48:18.127
Let's give you a few minutes
to just try to decompress.

48:18.229 --> 48:21.030
Try to clear your
mind a little bit.

48:21.132 --> 48:24.000
Let's see how you're doing
in about 10 or 15 minutes.

48:24.102 --> 48:25.635
- Okay
- Okay, maybe get some coffee,

48:25.737 --> 48:28.237
get something to eat and
let's just try to regroup

48:28.339 --> 48:30.172
in a little bit and
see how you're feeling.

48:30.275 --> 48:31.007
- Okay.
- Okay.

48:31.109 --> 48:32.174
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

48:40.885 --> 48:44.153
- I'm going to say good
morning and afternoon.

48:44.255 --> 48:46.455
It's been a rough
morning for you, Terri.

48:46.557 --> 48:48.391
I've got to turn it over to Cory

48:48.493 --> 48:50.192
so that he can talk
about what we can do

48:50.295 --> 48:51.694
to try to salvage the day.

48:51.796 --> 48:53.963
- We're supposed to be
at Roy's house tomorrow.

48:54.065 --> 48:57.066
That gives us this
afternoon only.

48:57.168 --> 48:59.335
Honestly, today the
decisions that you're making

48:59.437 --> 49:02.238
need to be, "Am I going
to absolutely need this

49:02.340 --> 49:03.739
"to move on with my life?"

49:03.841 --> 49:05.708
We put a lot more value on you

49:05.810 --> 49:06.742
than the things that
we're taking out of here.

49:06.844 --> 49:10.579
- You cannot replace
the 43 year relationship

49:10.682 --> 49:12.915
with a man that
loves and adores you

49:13.017 --> 49:15.184
and wants to live in
this house with you.

49:17.188 --> 49:17.720
- Let's just do it.

49:17.822 --> 49:18.854
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

49:18.957 --> 49:20.356
- And we'll see how it goes.
- Right now.

49:20.458 --> 49:21.290
- If we have some struggles,

49:21.392 --> 49:22.525
we'll figure it out.
- We're all here.

49:22.627 --> 49:23.659
- Okay, alright?
- Okay.

49:23.761 --> 49:24.727
- You can do it.
- Okay.

49:24.829 --> 49:26.062
- Alright.
- You can do this.

49:26.164 --> 49:27.964
- Thank you guys.
- Thank you.

49:43.915 --> 49:44.680
- Hang on, hang on,

49:44.782 --> 49:45.648
hang on, hang on.

49:45.750 --> 49:48.050
I want you to just
take a deep breath.

49:48.152 --> 49:51.921
I know you're frustrated,
it's been a really rough day.

49:52.023 --> 49:53.422
What's going on?

49:53.524 --> 49:56.525
- What if I could
have an estate person

49:56.627 --> 49:58.995
come in and do a sale here?

49:59.864 --> 50:00.963
That might be good.

50:02.467 --> 50:05.134
- Our goal here was never
to do an estate sale.

50:05.236 --> 50:06.635
If you were going to
do an estate sale,

50:06.738 --> 50:07.636
you wouldn't need us.

50:07.739 --> 50:09.238
- I'm throwing out ideas.

50:09.340 --> 50:11.007
- Right.
- That I know that

50:11.109 --> 50:13.476
it's been an inconvenient
for the workers-

50:13.578 --> 50:14.443
- No, no, it's not-

50:14.545 --> 50:16.846
- By me screwing
this up this morning.

50:16.948 --> 50:17.980
- No, no, no.

50:18.082 --> 50:19.582
- And then to say how
much (beep) there is here.

50:20.718 --> 50:22.251
- Terri, you're not
listening to me.

50:22.353 --> 50:24.854
I hear what you're saying
and that is that you have

50:24.956 --> 50:27.590
valuable stuff that
you want to get rid of.

50:27.692 --> 50:30.226
At this point, Cory,
have you seen anything

50:30.328 --> 50:34.296
that's come out that
would require someone

50:34.399 --> 50:37.099
to come in and start
estimating value?

50:37.201 --> 50:38.567
- Down in the basement just now

50:38.669 --> 50:40.403
I saw some nice pieces
of furniture, that's it.

50:40.505 --> 50:41.470
But I already told you,

50:41.572 --> 50:42.471
we're not focusing

50:42.573 --> 50:43.572
on the basement.
- We're not going down

50:43.674 --> 50:45.241
to the basement. we're
just doing the top.

50:45.343 --> 50:46.575
That's always been said.
- Well I didn't-

50:46.677 --> 50:48.077
Nobody said that to me!

50:49.714 --> 50:51.247
And nobody said anything
about the attic,

50:51.349 --> 50:54.483
and nobody said anything
about the garage!

50:54.585 --> 50:56.986
So, how am I to know
that this is something

50:57.088 --> 50:58.587
that's not going to be done?

50:58.689 --> 51:01.190
- Terri, all yesterday-
- I know it now!

51:01.292 --> 51:03.659
- Terri, yesterday that
came up several times.

51:03.761 --> 51:06.095
- Nobody said,
"Don't worry, Terri.

51:06.197 --> 51:07.563
We're not going to
do the basement."

51:07.665 --> 51:08.864
- I told you that yesterday.

51:08.966 --> 51:10.166
- No, well-
- I said we are not going

51:10.268 --> 51:11.233
to get to the
basement yesterday.

51:11.335 --> 51:14.403
- I've got a knocked
down wardrobe downstairs.

51:14.505 --> 51:15.404
- In the basement?

51:15.506 --> 51:16.839
- Yes, in the basement,
and I don't know-

51:16.941 --> 51:18.641
- I don't even think we're
going to get to the basement,

51:18.743 --> 51:19.809
- Okay.
- So, let's not even worry

51:19.911 --> 51:22.745
about that, let's just
worry about the main floor.

51:22.847 --> 51:25.614
- So Terri, all of
this is avoiding

51:25.716 --> 51:28.084
dealing what we can deal with.

51:28.186 --> 51:29.852
We are it's,

51:29.954 --> 51:32.988
we're now in the heart
of the afternoon.

51:33.091 --> 51:34.790
We haven't even started yet.

51:34.892 --> 51:36.058
Okay.
- So, where's

51:36.160 --> 51:39.195
the piece of furniture that
was right there by the door?

51:39.297 --> 51:40.296
- I don't know,
I don't even know

51:40.398 --> 51:42.398
what piece of furniture
you're talking about.

51:42.500 --> 51:43.766
- The little, the
piece of furniture

51:43.868 --> 51:46.502
that was at the
door, walking in.

51:46.604 --> 51:49.238
It was a pedestal, it
was a church pedestal.

51:49.340 --> 51:50.706
I don't see it anywhere here.

51:50.808 --> 51:51.674
- Okay.

51:51.776 --> 51:52.675
- And nobody said
anything to me.

51:52.777 --> 51:54.176
"Oh, do you want to keep this?"

51:54.278 --> 51:56.145
And that was a
sentimental piece too, so,

51:56.247 --> 51:58.514
so we'll-
- Let's have you check

51:58.616 --> 52:00.149
with your guys,
and in the meantime

52:00.251 --> 52:01.817
we'll have the guys start
bringing this stuff out

52:01.919 --> 52:03.252
for sorting, okay?

52:03.354 --> 52:03.886
- Okay.

52:03.988 --> 52:05.087
- Alright sounds good.

52:06.290 --> 52:09.959
I have honestly, never seen
anything like this before.

52:11.329 --> 52:14.163
I think that she's throwing
out just all these defenses

52:14.265 --> 52:15.030
- Yeah.

52:15.133 --> 52:16.265
- for us to
- Roadblocks for us.

52:16.367 --> 52:18.601
- They're roadblocks for
us not to move forward.

52:25.676 --> 52:28.244
(suspenseful music)

52:32.517 --> 52:33.549
- Another breaking point.

52:33.651 --> 52:34.750
This time it's a pedestal

52:34.852 --> 52:36.552
that was in her
kitchen somewhere.

52:36.654 --> 52:38.521
I have no idea where it is.

52:38.623 --> 52:39.989
We're going to go
try to find it,

52:40.091 --> 52:43.192
and hopefully we do, but
it's just a pedestal.

52:43.294 --> 52:45.761
We're focusing on the
minutia in a huge problem.

52:51.769 --> 52:52.501
- What?

52:52.603 --> 52:53.802
- Isn't that you
were looking for?

52:53.905 --> 52:54.970
- Okay, where was it?

52:55.072 --> 52:56.772
- In the front. We went and
got it out of the truck,

52:56.874 --> 52:57.873
It's still here.

52:57.975 --> 52:59.308
We didn't throw it away.
- Okay, you got it out

52:59.410 --> 53:00.176
of the truck.

53:00.278 --> 53:01.010
- Uh huh.
- Why was it in the truck

53:01.112 --> 53:02.111
to begin with?

53:02.213 --> 53:02.711
- Because someone put
it in the donate pile,

53:02.813 --> 53:03.546
but it didn't go.

53:03.648 --> 53:04.713
It's here-
- And nobody

53:04.815 --> 53:05.981
showed me it, either.

53:06.083 --> 53:08.951
- Terri dear, I could have
been responsible for that.

53:09.053 --> 53:09.585
- What the-

53:09.687 --> 53:10.753
- Terri is very upset.

53:10.855 --> 53:14.023
She's thinking that one
of the staff members

53:14.125 --> 53:16.992
put it where she
can not find it now.

53:17.094 --> 53:19.695
I'm the one who said,
"Yeah, donate that."

53:19.797 --> 53:21.497
Typically, I'm the
one who gives things

53:21.599 --> 53:24.099
of Terri's away,
and I did this time.

53:24.202 --> 53:26.001
I didn't know that was
your sentimental piece.

53:26.103 --> 53:28.971
I am responsible for
that, it's ugly to me.

53:29.073 --> 53:31.674
But so I'm sorry,
that's what happened.

53:32.843 --> 53:33.842
- Just know, everyone's here

53:33.945 --> 53:35.644
trying to make the
best decisions for you.

53:35.746 --> 53:36.645
Mistakes will happen.

53:36.747 --> 53:39.882
- And just know that
I'm way up there.

53:39.984 --> 53:40.883
- We need to get busy here.

53:40.985 --> 53:43.652
I am very concerned
that so many of us

53:43.754 --> 53:45.921
are standing around,
not getting things done

53:46.023 --> 53:48.524
when so much needs to be
done here at this house.

53:48.626 --> 53:50.159
- Everyone here, you
can see them all,

53:50.261 --> 53:51.627
they're all trying to help you.

53:51.729 --> 53:53.562
We're just trying to make
your situation better,

53:53.664 --> 53:55.397
and the only way to do
that, is to give up control.

53:55.499 --> 53:58.200
And when you give up control,
sometimes this happens.

53:58.302 --> 54:00.236
Luckily the thrift store
didn't even want it.

54:00.338 --> 54:01.203
- It's painted.

54:01.305 --> 54:01.937
It's not

54:02.039 --> 54:02.838
real good.
- It's not-

54:02.940 --> 54:04.540
Just don't worry
about it, Kraig.

54:04.642 --> 54:05.641
- Yeah, well that's
why I gave it away,

54:05.743 --> 54:07.409
cause it was so ugly.

54:07.511 --> 54:09.845
- Do I need to come
to you and ask you,

54:09.947 --> 54:11.647
"Oh, do you like this, Kraig?

54:11.749 --> 54:13.782
"Do you want to keep this?"

54:13.884 --> 54:14.817
- We have to empty your house.

54:14.919 --> 54:16.885
I just got the list
from Code Enforcement

54:16.988 --> 54:19.188
and it tells me this
house has to be emptied

54:19.290 --> 54:22.424
of all this stuff for
them to uncondemn it,

54:22.526 --> 54:24.059
like a normal
functioning, safe house.

54:24.161 --> 54:25.194
- Yes, Terri dear.

54:25.296 --> 54:27.563
- And that's going to
require getting rid of

54:28.666 --> 54:30.733
a couple of tons of
stuff from your house.

54:30.835 --> 54:31.867
I have a solution.

54:31.969 --> 54:34.637
I have an army of people here.

54:34.739 --> 54:37.840
- Come on Terri dear,
get them busy please.

54:37.942 --> 54:39.508
Move out of the way of the
door and let people in,

54:39.610 --> 54:40.943
Terri, and let them get busy.

54:41.045 --> 54:41.977
Come on.
- Well, start!

54:42.079 --> 54:43.145
Start it!

54:43.247 --> 54:44.079
- Well that's
- Okay!

54:44.181 --> 54:45.347
- what you need to hear.

54:45.449 --> 54:46.749
Don't,
- Are we done?

54:46.851 --> 54:48.384
don't yell at him.
- Are we done right now

54:48.486 --> 54:49.418
speaking right here?
- Why are you yelling

54:49.520 --> 54:50.753
at me again?

54:50.855 --> 54:53.889
(suspenseful music)

54:57.862 --> 55:00.329
- Through this process,
things will get lost.

55:00.431 --> 55:03.966
Things will break,
things will disappear.

55:04.068 --> 55:08.037
But the end result of you
getting your house uncondemned

55:08.139 --> 55:11.340
and having a new
life, is still there.

55:11.442 --> 55:14.543
So, I understand
this bothers you,

55:14.645 --> 55:16.011
but I want it to bother you

55:16.113 --> 55:17.946
that your house is
condemned even more.

55:18.049 --> 55:19.148
- We're at a standstill.

55:19.250 --> 55:22.318
Cory and I need to figure
out what our next steps are.

55:22.420 --> 55:24.653
We need for Terri to
make some decisions

55:24.755 --> 55:26.588
so that we can make
this functional.

55:26.691 --> 55:28.390
- So, come on in here.
- Come in here.

55:28.492 --> 55:30.326
Let's try to nestle in and-

55:30.428 --> 55:31.794
- Problem is, we're
kind of stuck.

55:31.896 --> 55:32.961
Like, we've gotten rid
of all the little things,

55:33.064 --> 55:36.365
all the cluttery stuff,
but now we've noticed

55:36.467 --> 55:38.701
we can't really make a
living room out of this

55:38.803 --> 55:40.169
because you have
so much furniture,

55:40.271 --> 55:42.037
So many big bulky things.

55:42.139 --> 55:43.372
You have dressers everywhere.

55:43.474 --> 55:44.340
You have shelving everywhere.

55:44.442 --> 55:47.276
You, like, what can
we do with this?

55:47.378 --> 55:48.911
- And there's not even a couch

55:49.013 --> 55:51.013
or the normal living
room furniture.

55:51.115 --> 55:53.782
- Well, I would love to
create a living room for you

55:53.884 --> 55:55.751
with a couch where
you would watch TV

55:55.853 --> 55:58.520
and all the normal things that
people do in a living room.

55:58.622 --> 56:00.522
- Can any of that go?

56:00.624 --> 56:03.425
- These shelves I'd
like to keep for sure.

56:03.527 --> 56:06.729
The little tables, this
table I want to keep.

56:06.831 --> 56:08.163
- So is this the way we're
going to leave this room,

56:08.265 --> 56:10.899
essentially, since you
want to keep all this?

56:11.001 --> 56:12.668
- We're really
struggling with Terri.

56:12.770 --> 56:14.002
- I'd like to keep this.

56:14.105 --> 56:17.806
- She wants to hold onto all
of this big bulky furniture.

56:17.908 --> 56:21.009
We can't make a beautiful,
safe, functional,

56:21.112 --> 56:23.078
or even a house
that's not condemned

56:23.180 --> 56:24.747
if she's going to
keep all of this.

56:24.849 --> 56:25.781
But wouldn't it be nice to have

56:25.883 --> 56:28.183
a very comfortable,
beautiful living room

56:28.285 --> 56:30.352
with a couch in here,
maybe a little chair.

56:31.522 --> 56:33.389
- A place that you
and Kraig could sit,

56:33.491 --> 56:35.524
enjoy each other's company.

56:35.626 --> 56:36.925
- I don't know what to say.

56:37.027 --> 56:39.395
- If you say, "I want
to keep this stuff,"

56:39.497 --> 56:41.830
then what we do is say, "Okay."

56:41.932 --> 56:43.632
We'll just have to
leave it like this,

56:43.734 --> 56:45.934
rather than the hope of creating

56:46.036 --> 56:49.204
a nice living space
for you and Kraig.

56:51.575 --> 56:54.243
- What visions did you have
for this different furniture?

56:54.345 --> 56:56.812
Where were you
planning on putting it?

56:56.914 --> 56:57.813
- I don't know.

56:57.915 --> 56:59.748
- Is a studio your priority?

56:59.850 --> 57:01.083
- Yes.

57:01.185 --> 57:02.818
- My thing is, you
know, of all things,

57:02.920 --> 57:05.454
you know, a priority
in your life is just,

57:05.556 --> 57:08.991
is for this whole
house as an art studio.

57:10.327 --> 57:13.195
- We're getting the impression
that really, for Terri,

57:13.297 --> 57:15.564
this is going to be
a huge storage house

57:15.666 --> 57:18.634
with one studio room where
she can make projects.

57:18.736 --> 57:19.968
It's not really a home.

57:20.070 --> 57:20.769
- And that's what bothers me.

57:20.871 --> 57:24.039
I want this to be your home.

57:24.141 --> 57:26.175
- The house will stay condemned

57:26.277 --> 57:28.110
in the condition
that this room is in.

57:28.212 --> 57:30.245
We can't leave all
this stuff here

57:30.347 --> 57:31.947
and have it pass inspection.

57:33.417 --> 57:35.050
So, that's kind
of where we're at.

57:42.560 --> 57:44.660
(suspenseful music)

58:05.583 --> 58:06.215
- Good morning, you guys.

58:06.317 --> 58:07.382
- [Everyone] Good morning.

58:07.485 --> 58:08.717
- How are you feeling
after yesterday?

58:08.819 --> 58:10.152
Let's just check in first.

58:10.254 --> 58:12.454
- Was not a good night here.

58:12.556 --> 58:14.056
And,

58:14.158 --> 58:15.991
And I'm running,
I'm leaving here

58:16.093 --> 58:17.192
to go help Kraig in the morning-

58:17.294 --> 58:18.627
- There's too much
on your plate.

58:18.729 --> 58:20.462
- And then I'm here,
- Right.

58:20.564 --> 58:22.998
- And then I'm like 100
- I know.

58:23.100 --> 58:28.103
- Pokers in the fire, and
there's a fire in every corner.

58:28.672 --> 58:30.672
- So, hopefully with everything
that we're doing for you

58:30.774 --> 58:32.140
during the time that we're here,

58:32.243 --> 58:33.175
it's going to take one layer

58:33.277 --> 58:36.545
and one more poker out
of the fire for you.

58:36.647 --> 58:38.480
- Let's get started,
because again,

58:38.582 --> 58:41.083
every time we do this, we're
losing a little bit of time.

58:41.185 --> 58:42.885
There's a lot to do here.
- Okay, okay.

58:42.987 --> 58:45.020
- Dr. Zasio hasn't even
seen this house yet.

58:45.122 --> 58:47.256
So can we go in,
introduce her to Roy?

58:47.358 --> 58:48.423
- Yes, and-

58:48.526 --> 58:50.225
- And I'd like to show her
around a little bit, too.

58:50.327 --> 58:51.527
- Okay.
- So she knows kind of what

58:51.629 --> 58:52.794
the plan will be
- Let's see what we got.

58:52.897 --> 58:53.762
- for the cleanup.
- Okay.

58:53.864 --> 58:54.897
- Let's go on in.

58:58.102 --> 59:02.804
- Roy, this is Dr. Zasio.

59:02.907 --> 59:03.705
- Yes.

59:03.807 --> 59:04.406
- Hi, Roy.
- Hello.

59:04.508 --> 59:05.507
- It's nice to meet you.

59:05.609 --> 59:06.241
- How are you doing, Roy?

59:07.411 --> 59:08.477
- Sorry for the intrusion.

59:08.579 --> 59:09.778
I know this is a lot of people.

59:09.880 --> 59:11.013
We apologize for that.

59:12.483 --> 59:14.416
- Are you okay with having
all this stuff here?

59:16.253 --> 59:17.619
- You want it all out, okay.

59:18.489 --> 59:19.488
- Okay.

59:25.162 --> 59:26.361
- Well, that's why we're here,

59:26.463 --> 59:30.799
because we're very concerned
about the amount of stuff

59:30.901 --> 59:35.170
and the fact that the areas
of your house cannot be used.

59:35.272 --> 59:36.138
You can't use the table.

59:36.240 --> 59:37.406
You can't use the counter-

59:40.644 --> 59:42.544
- No. Roy.

59:55.125 --> 59:58.827
- You told me to come in
and make my home here, too.

59:58.929 --> 1:00:00.162
You-

1:00:01.398 --> 1:00:02.497
- Terri.

1:00:04.268 --> 1:00:06.501
- I need to ask you,

1:00:06.604 --> 1:00:07.603
- I need to ask you
- I'm sorry.

1:00:07.705 --> 1:00:08.704
- to settle down.
- Okay.

1:00:08.806 --> 1:00:10.672
- Okay?
- Okay.

1:00:10.774 --> 1:00:12.007
- Terri, Terri.

1:00:12.109 --> 1:00:13.609
- Terri, please settle down,

1:00:13.711 --> 1:00:14.443
- Okay.
- Okay?

1:00:14.545 --> 1:00:15.777
- But can-
- Terri, Terri

1:00:15.879 --> 1:00:18.046
- No, no just shush.
- Please settle down, okay?

1:00:18.148 --> 1:00:19.948
- Roy, with your permission,

1:00:20.050 --> 1:00:21.283
could Cory show me around

1:00:21.385 --> 1:00:22.551
so I can get a better sense of

1:00:22.653 --> 1:00:23.652
what we need to do?

1:00:25.623 --> 1:00:26.388
- Okay.

1:00:29.360 --> 1:00:32.527
Oh no, this is totally blocked.

1:00:32.630 --> 1:00:33.528
Completely blocked.

1:00:33.631 --> 1:00:34.596
- Right.

1:00:34.698 --> 1:00:36.598
- That's his bedroom
and there's no escape.

1:00:36.700 --> 1:00:38.066
- Correct.

1:00:38.168 --> 1:00:39.234
- And so the reality is,
is between the front room

1:00:39.336 --> 1:00:43.271
and between here, if there
was a medical emergency,

1:00:43.374 --> 1:00:44.539
the paramedics would not
be able to get to him.

1:00:44.642 --> 1:00:46.208
- Or a fire.

1:00:46.310 --> 1:00:46.875
- Right.
- He couldn't get out.

1:00:46.977 --> 1:00:48.644
- Right.
- You know.

1:00:48.746 --> 1:00:50.779
- And this room is
completely filled.

1:00:50.881 --> 1:00:52.080
We, I don't even
know what's in there

1:00:52.182 --> 1:00:53.582
because we can't get back there.

1:00:53.684 --> 1:00:56.852
- [Cory] Can only assume.

1:00:56.954 --> 1:00:58.286
Let's look at the kitchen.

1:00:59.223 --> 1:01:00.689
This is not accessible.

1:01:00.791 --> 1:01:03.492
He can't heat up a plate
that she's left for him

1:01:03.594 --> 1:01:05.327
because this is totally covered.

1:01:05.429 --> 1:01:07.396
And look, this is a
trip hazard obviously.

1:01:07.498 --> 1:01:08.230
- Uh huh.

1:01:08.332 --> 1:01:09.931
- So, alright.

1:01:17.274 --> 1:01:18.907
Wow, there's like a whole
apartment down here,

1:01:19.009 --> 1:01:20.475
essentially, wow.
- I know, right.

1:01:20.577 --> 1:01:22.411
And this is where
the laundry is.

1:01:22.513 --> 1:01:23.245
- Where?

1:01:23.347 --> 1:01:25.013
Oh, geez.
- Back through there.

1:01:25.115 --> 1:01:26.448
- Okay.
- So again,

1:01:26.550 --> 1:01:27.616
just access issues.

1:01:27.718 --> 1:01:30.118
- Even the laundry room
is just filled with stuff.

1:01:34.358 --> 1:01:38.660
Essentially, she's taken
over the entire basement.

1:01:38.762 --> 1:01:41.596
While I know he can't
physically come down here,

1:01:41.699 --> 1:01:42.864
that's irrelevant.

1:01:42.966 --> 1:01:44.499
It's his home,
it's his property.

1:01:44.601 --> 1:01:46.368
He has not given her permission.

1:01:46.470 --> 1:01:49.071
He's expressed that
he's upset about it.

1:01:49.173 --> 1:01:52.541
There are a number of issues
that I'm very concerned about,

1:01:52.643 --> 1:01:54.242
and I need to talk to Terri.

1:01:56.847 --> 1:01:58.714
- Come on over.
- Come in.

1:01:58.816 --> 1:02:01.783
You know Terri, we
are unfortunately,

1:02:01.885 --> 1:02:04.720
in a situation where
based on Cory's

1:02:04.822 --> 1:02:07.022
assessment and my observations

1:02:07.124 --> 1:02:08.757
that this is a situation that

1:02:08.859 --> 1:02:12.861
is reportable to Adult
Protective Services.

1:02:12.963 --> 1:02:16.798
And this isn't going to be
easy for you. I understand.

1:02:16.900 --> 1:02:19.101
I need to make a call, okay?

1:02:19.203 --> 1:02:21.002
You're more than welcome
to be there with me

1:02:21.105 --> 1:02:23.138
when I make the call if
you would like to hear

1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:25.907
what I have to say,
that is up to you.

1:02:26.009 --> 1:02:28.810
- I would like to
be there with you.

1:02:28.912 --> 1:02:30.612
- Okay. And Cheryl, I would
like for you to be there

1:02:30.714 --> 1:02:31.780
to support Terri.

1:02:31.882 --> 1:02:32.948
- Alright.

1:02:33.050 --> 1:02:36.818
- The bottom line is the
house is not safe for Roy,

1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:38.353
and I am a mandated reporter

1:02:38.455 --> 1:02:41.022
and I have to call Adult
Protective Services.

1:02:41.125 --> 1:02:43.992
I am helping a caregiver.

1:02:44.094 --> 1:02:47.529
She struggles with
hoarding behaviors,

1:02:47.631 --> 1:02:51.800
and it has led to the
home being unsafe.

1:02:51.902 --> 1:02:53.935
Blocked passages where
it would be difficult

1:02:54.037 --> 1:02:57.939
for medical personnel to
come in and fire hazards.

1:03:03.914 --> 1:03:06.448
Thank you very much for
your help, I appreciate it.

1:03:06.550 --> 1:03:07.983
- [APS] Sure, no problem.

1:03:08.085 --> 1:03:09.484
- Okay thank you, bye bye.

1:03:11.421 --> 1:03:15.457
Okay so Terri, they
did take the report.

1:03:15.559 --> 1:03:16.892
I hope that you don't take this

1:03:16.994 --> 1:03:18.326
as being something negative,

1:03:18.428 --> 1:03:21.763
as something that
probably needed to happen

1:03:21.865 --> 1:03:25.534
to wake you up to
make that change.

1:03:25.636 --> 1:03:26.334
- Sure.

1:03:26.436 --> 1:03:27.602
- Okay?

1:03:27.704 --> 1:03:30.405
You've admitted yourself that
things are out of control.

1:03:30.507 --> 1:03:32.407
It was beyond your
scope and ability

1:03:32.509 --> 1:03:33.675
to get this taken care of.

1:03:33.777 --> 1:03:35.944
It's beyond what
your family can do.

1:03:36.046 --> 1:03:36.945
You know, we are vessels

1:03:37.047 --> 1:03:39.848
that can only be
filled with so much.

1:03:39.950 --> 1:03:44.553
And once we get on tilt,
this is just human nature.

1:03:44.655 --> 1:03:46.822
It's going to affect you,

1:03:46.924 --> 1:03:49.524
and it's going to affect
the people around you, too.

1:03:55.265 --> 1:03:58.300
- Think of how long this has
been affecting you, Terri.

1:04:04.041 --> 1:04:06.675
(Terri sobbing)

1:04:16.119 --> 1:04:18.186
- Terri, do you remember
the first day I met you,

1:04:18.288 --> 1:04:20.088
I told you this was
not about a cleanup?

1:04:20.190 --> 1:04:21.523
- Uh huh.

1:04:21.625 --> 1:04:23.525
- This is about
dealing with the issues

1:04:23.627 --> 1:04:26.661
that have led to the stuff.

1:04:28.332 --> 1:04:32.400
And I was so afraid we
wouldn't be able to get to this

1:04:33.370 --> 1:04:37.772
because there's
been so many issues

1:04:40.544 --> 1:04:43.111
that you've been
dealing with, that we

1:04:44.548 --> 1:04:47.782
that we haven't even had a
chance to do any digging.

1:04:47.885 --> 1:04:49.618
And that's really why I'm here.

1:04:51.288 --> 1:04:54.522
I don't know why it is

1:04:54.625 --> 1:04:59.561
that people have to
get so broken to heal,

1:05:00.764 --> 1:05:02.564
but that's what's
happened with you.

1:05:09.840 --> 1:05:12.307
(Suspenseful music)

1:05:18.916 --> 1:05:22.150
(truck reverse beeping)

1:05:36.366 --> 1:05:39.534
- The only way that
change can happen

1:05:39.636 --> 1:05:42.737
is one, to recognize
that there's a problem,

1:05:42.839 --> 1:05:43.471
right?
- Right.

1:05:43.573 --> 1:05:44.906
Which you have.
- Right.

1:05:45.008 --> 1:05:48.576
And two, to find a solution.

1:05:50.380 --> 1:05:52.881
And we have a solution to this.

1:05:52.983 --> 1:05:55.951
We don't have a solution
to all the other problems

1:05:56.053 --> 1:05:57.886
you have right now, okay.

1:05:59.156 --> 1:06:01.256
We're going to have
Cory's team come in

1:06:01.358 --> 1:06:04.893
and we got to let this
stuff go out, okay?

1:06:06.630 --> 1:06:07.696
You ready?

1:06:07.798 --> 1:06:08.797
Let's make it happen.

1:06:12.703 --> 1:06:13.868
- Come on over, Terri.

1:06:15.138 --> 1:06:17.605
So, we figured this would be
a good project to start on,

1:06:17.708 --> 1:06:19.574
to clean out the car,
clean out Roy's car.

1:06:19.676 --> 1:06:22.043
I want to specify this
isn't even your car.

1:06:22.145 --> 1:06:23.011
Is this something you think

1:06:23.113 --> 1:06:25.146
you can help us
tackle pretty quickly?

1:06:25.248 --> 1:06:26.081
- I hope so.

1:06:26.183 --> 1:06:27.415
- The whole APS thing

1:06:27.517 --> 1:06:29.017
throws a whole other
wrench into this,

1:06:29.119 --> 1:06:31.653
so this has to be done today.

1:06:31.755 --> 1:06:32.587
- Uh huh.

1:06:32.689 --> 1:06:34.089
- And I don't want
to box things up

1:06:34.191 --> 1:06:35.890
and take it back to your house.

1:06:35.993 --> 1:06:37.993
- I will have things
to put into boxes.

1:06:38.095 --> 1:06:39.027
- Okay.

1:06:39.129 --> 1:06:41.363
- Can you limit yourself
to four boxes or so?

1:06:43.500 --> 1:06:45.166
- I don't know, I don't know.

1:06:45.268 --> 1:06:46.768
- Will you bring one of those
trash cans over here, guys?

1:06:46.870 --> 1:06:48.570
- Why don't we start
and see what happens.

1:06:48.672 --> 1:06:49.704
- Okay.
- Alright, guys.

1:06:49.806 --> 1:06:50.772
- Thank you, so,

1:06:55.712 --> 1:06:57.245
- This can be donated.

1:06:57.347 --> 1:06:58.747
- Hey,
- We're not donating.

1:06:58.849 --> 1:06:59.514
- Let's not think
about that today.

1:06:59.616 --> 1:07:00.949
- We can't donate at this point.

1:07:01.051 --> 1:07:02.484
- We have taken
hundreds of boxes

1:07:02.586 --> 1:07:03.551
up there already.
- And nobody's

1:07:03.653 --> 1:07:04.386
accepting them anymore.
- They're refusing

1:07:04.488 --> 1:07:06.087
at the donation at this point.

1:07:06.189 --> 1:07:07.088
Let's not put it
on top of the car.

1:07:07.190 --> 1:07:08.323
- What are you going
to save it for now?

1:07:08.425 --> 1:07:10.258
Because we said we
wouldn't donate it?

1:07:10.360 --> 1:07:11.893
How is this going
to change your life?

1:07:11.995 --> 1:07:14.829
In four hours APS is
going to get a phone call

1:07:14.931 --> 1:07:18.066
that you either did empty
everything or you didn't.

1:07:18.168 --> 1:07:20.602
How is this going to help
your cause right now?

1:07:21.772 --> 1:07:23.271
Terri's getting hung up
on very small things.

1:07:23.373 --> 1:07:26.041
We need her to make quick
decisions just to let it go,

1:07:26.143 --> 1:07:27.842
so we can move on
and get to the house.

1:07:27.944 --> 1:07:30.245
- This was a save, save them.

1:07:31.048 --> 1:07:32.480
Save them.

1:07:32.582 --> 1:07:34.582
- Is anything that you've
put in those boxes so far,

1:07:35.919 --> 1:07:38.119
mandatory for you to live?

1:07:38.221 --> 1:07:39.087
I mean,
- No.

1:07:39.189 --> 1:07:40.555
- We're at this point.

1:07:40.657 --> 1:07:42.824
- And if you let it go
while you're not looking,

1:07:42.926 --> 1:07:45.460
Terri, can you just
let them clean it out?

1:07:45.562 --> 1:07:47.328
- You don't even
know what's in here.

1:07:49.032 --> 1:07:51.299
But obviously you
haven't needed it to live

1:07:51.401 --> 1:07:52.934
because it's been
buried in this car.

1:07:53.036 --> 1:07:54.069
- I know.

1:07:54.171 --> 1:07:55.737
- We have to get you
painting and artistic again

1:07:55.839 --> 1:07:56.604
and bring you back something

1:07:56.807 --> 1:07:58.006
that really brings
you happiness,

1:07:58.108 --> 1:07:59.741
cause this stuff isn't
bringing you true happiness,

1:07:59.843 --> 1:08:00.742
you know that.

1:08:01.812 --> 1:08:03.411
What if the guys just take
everything out of here

1:08:03.513 --> 1:08:04.979
and let it go, and we can
move on to something else?

1:08:05.082 --> 1:08:06.614
- Okay.
- Let's go, let's keep moving.

1:08:06.716 --> 1:08:10.185
- Okay, well then maybe I
need to step away from it

1:08:10.287 --> 1:08:12.287
and then let's
see how that goes.

1:08:12.389 --> 1:08:14.889
(upbeat music)

1:08:25.135 --> 1:08:26.801
- So, am I supposed to
just stand here then,

1:08:26.903 --> 1:08:28.703
and just watch everything go?

1:08:30.040 --> 1:08:31.873
- Terri, if we had
somewhere to put it,

1:08:31.975 --> 1:08:33.575
it would be a non-issue.

1:08:34.611 --> 1:08:35.743
- I was quite surprised.

1:08:35.846 --> 1:08:38.113
We managed to get through
the car relatively quickly.

1:08:39.449 --> 1:08:41.483
She got upset a few times,
but at the end of the day,

1:08:41.585 --> 1:08:44.419
she gave up control and
let almost everything go,

1:08:44.521 --> 1:08:47.455
with about five boxes full
to bring back to her house.

1:08:49.626 --> 1:08:51.259
Alright Terri,

1:08:51.361 --> 1:08:52.393
- Uh huh.
- Moment of truth.

1:08:52.496 --> 1:08:54.529
We need to get this room clear.

1:08:54.631 --> 1:08:56.464
The room where Roy sits
all the time, clear,

1:08:56.566 --> 1:08:57.332
where your couch is.

1:08:57.434 --> 1:08:59.767
- Uh huh.
- Get the kitchen clear

1:08:59.870 --> 1:09:00.869
and this hallway clear.

1:09:00.971 --> 1:09:01.703
- Okay.

1:09:01.805 --> 1:09:02.504
- Okay?

1:09:02.606 --> 1:09:03.338
- Okay.

1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:04.472
- And as you know,

1:09:04.574 --> 1:09:06.141
we don't have a lot of
time to get that done.

1:09:06.243 --> 1:09:07.742
Please make good decisions

1:09:07.844 --> 1:09:10.979
on what is truly going
to be used and needed

1:09:11.081 --> 1:09:13.414
to live your new life
in your new home.

1:09:13.517 --> 1:09:14.816
Think differently.

1:09:18.555 --> 1:09:19.754
Okay, what are we doing?

1:09:19.856 --> 1:09:21.089
You touched the bag and
then you put it back down.

1:09:21.191 --> 1:09:23.691
- Well, I think I
want to keep that bag.

1:09:23.793 --> 1:09:24.993
- Why do you want to keep it?

1:09:25.095 --> 1:09:26.427
- Because it's got glasses.

1:09:26.530 --> 1:09:29.397
This matches the set that
just got thrown away.

1:09:29.499 --> 1:09:30.498
- Terri, this is the problem.

1:09:30.600 --> 1:09:32.333
We have saved countless glasses.

1:09:32.435 --> 1:09:35.436
I see they're beautiful,
I don't discount that.

1:09:35.539 --> 1:09:38.506
There's no place to
put it, is the problem.

1:09:38.608 --> 1:09:40.141
- You have to let this stuff go.

1:09:40.243 --> 1:09:42.243
- Well it's going.
- Okay.

1:09:42.345 --> 1:09:43.511
- What are you doing
with the shoes?

1:09:43.613 --> 1:09:44.612
Don't put them
back in this room.

1:09:47.050 --> 1:09:50.218
What are you going-
(shoes hitting floor)

1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:53.354
(suspenseful music)

1:09:55.058 --> 1:09:56.558
Talk through this, okay?

1:09:56.660 --> 1:09:58.092
Moldy bread, I get that.

1:09:59.429 --> 1:10:01.029
- Terri, let the guys
come in and do it.

1:10:01.131 --> 1:10:01.963
- Ah,

1:10:02.065 --> 1:10:03.965
- And you look away.

1:10:04.067 --> 1:10:05.300
- How can we speed it up?

1:10:06.136 --> 1:10:07.669
If you have to touch everything,

1:10:07.771 --> 1:10:08.670
we won't make our deadline.

1:10:08.772 --> 1:10:09.904
- I don't know.

1:10:10.006 --> 1:10:11.105
Would it be a huge
weight, and just

1:10:11.208 --> 1:10:14.709
that weight lifted off of
you if this was just done,

1:10:14.811 --> 1:10:15.843
so you could focus
on your house,

1:10:15.946 --> 1:10:18.713
you could focus on Kraig,
Roy could have his space.

1:10:18.815 --> 1:10:22.083
Is there any relief if
this was just done, or not?

1:10:23.420 --> 1:10:24.919
- Well-
- Is it still about the stuff?

1:10:25.021 --> 1:10:28.223
- Well, there's still stuff
about the stuff, I mean its-

1:10:28.325 --> 1:10:30.291
- Terri, it's not
their first rodeo,

1:10:30.393 --> 1:10:31.726
- So they know how hard it is
- I know that.

1:10:31.828 --> 1:10:32.961
I know!
- On people.

1:10:33.063 --> 1:10:35.830
- Terri, I'm not
getting on to you.

1:10:35.932 --> 1:10:38.132
I'm just letting you know
that they probably understand

1:10:38.235 --> 1:10:39.601
more then you think they do.

1:10:39.703 --> 1:10:41.703
- They don't
understand me though!

1:10:41.805 --> 1:10:44.839
- I think they understand
you quite well and-

1:10:44.941 --> 1:10:45.940
- Okay,
- it's just,

1:10:46.042 --> 1:10:47.141
you're the only one here.
- This is what

1:10:47.244 --> 1:10:48.443
I'm going to do!

1:10:48.545 --> 1:10:50.245
I'll just leave

1:10:50.347 --> 1:10:53.748
and let me go to a
room and I'll lay down!

1:10:53.850 --> 1:10:56.884
(suspenseful music)

1:11:08.665 --> 1:11:10.865
- So Cory, I just
think at this point,

1:11:10.967 --> 1:11:13.968
as much as we want to
continue to challenge her

1:11:14.070 --> 1:11:17.538
to make decisions, I think
we just need to let her be.

1:11:17.641 --> 1:11:19.340
She knows what'll happen

1:11:19.442 --> 1:11:20.808
if she doesn't get
this house in order.

1:11:20.910 --> 1:11:22.410
And there's really nothing
more that we can do.

1:11:22.512 --> 1:11:25.847
We're down to the
wire, and you know,

1:11:25.949 --> 1:11:27.315
I just don't see at this point,

1:11:27.417 --> 1:11:29.984
continuing to push her
is going to be helpful.

1:11:30.086 --> 1:11:31.185
- I want to make the
house safe for Roy.

1:11:31.288 --> 1:11:32.420
- I know.
- You know.

1:11:32.522 --> 1:11:33.021
- But we have to.
- It's his house.

1:11:33.123 --> 1:11:33.955
- I know.

1:11:34.057 --> 1:11:35.490
- So, if we have to
box everything up

1:11:35.592 --> 1:11:37.592
and take it back to her
house, I'd rather do that

1:11:37.694 --> 1:11:38.326
than leave it here
- Yeah.

1:11:38.428 --> 1:11:39.861
- where it's not his fault.

1:11:39.963 --> 1:11:41.062
- I totally agree.

1:11:41.164 --> 1:11:41.996
- Okay, so-
- And then

1:11:42.098 --> 1:11:43.264
she could deal with
those decisions.

1:11:43.366 --> 1:11:44.332
- Right, I'll tell my guys

1:11:44.434 --> 1:11:46.067
to literally go in there
and box everything up.

1:11:46.169 --> 1:11:47.035
- Okay.

1:11:47.137 --> 1:11:47.735
- And then she
won't lose anything.

1:11:47.837 --> 1:11:48.403
- Yup,

1:11:48.505 --> 1:11:49.270
okay.
- Sound good?

1:11:49.372 --> 1:11:50.138
- Sounds good.

1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:50.905
- Okay.

1:11:51.007 --> 1:11:53.441
(dramatic music)

1:11:57.781 --> 1:11:59.714
- Please don't
even ask just yet!

1:11:59.816 --> 1:12:02.717
If I make a safe
place for you to walk!

1:12:06.589 --> 1:12:09.590
- I can't stay here and
help you anymore, I can't!

1:12:11.127 --> 1:12:12.160
- Terri, what's going on?

1:12:14.464 --> 1:12:17.065
- He asked if they got
my bedroom cleaned.

1:12:17.934 --> 1:12:19.767
I'm like, "Roy, please."

1:12:19.869 --> 1:12:20.601
You know-

1:12:20.704 --> 1:12:23.171
- Terri, it's just a question.

1:12:23.273 --> 1:12:25.473
- I, right now, I
guess I can't handle

1:12:25.575 --> 1:12:26.407
- Okay.
- This.

1:12:26.509 --> 1:12:27.809
- Alright, settle down,

1:12:27.911 --> 1:12:28.910
settle down, it's okay.

1:12:29.012 --> 1:12:32.280
I think Roy sees this
as his one opportunity

1:12:32.382 --> 1:12:35.883
to get his house in order,
and he's understandably

1:12:35.985 --> 1:12:39.120
feeling very anxious
about this as well.

1:12:39.222 --> 1:12:42.890
- It's been a ping pong
ball going back and forth.

1:12:42.992 --> 1:12:43.825
I'm,

1:12:45.128 --> 1:12:46.728
it gets like that!

1:12:52.469 --> 1:12:54.102
- Cory, we need to
stop for the day.

1:12:54.204 --> 1:12:56.571
It's just too much
for her, okay?

1:12:56.673 --> 1:12:57.472
- Yup.

1:12:58.975 --> 1:13:00.441
- I tried so hard.

1:13:07.183 --> 1:13:09.650
(Suspenseful music)

1:13:15.225 --> 1:13:16.090
- Donate those.

1:13:16.192 --> 1:13:18.526
- Ew, dirty.

1:13:18.628 --> 1:13:20.161
- You've saved so
many silk things

1:13:20.263 --> 1:13:21.529
here, Terri.
- You know what,

1:13:21.631 --> 1:13:23.498
there's another box
of silk scarves.

1:13:23.600 --> 1:13:25.933
- Yeah, well I think
that can be donate stuff.

1:13:32.175 --> 1:13:33.441
- Okay guys, let's go.

1:13:34.844 --> 1:13:35.676
It's the last day,

1:13:35.779 --> 1:13:37.612
and here we are
back at Roy's house.

1:13:37.714 --> 1:13:40.581
This is not something that
we expected or needed.

1:13:40.683 --> 1:13:41.749
We have a lot to do,

1:13:41.851 --> 1:13:43.718
and I hope that she can
make quick decisions today

1:13:43.820 --> 1:13:45.753
and we can get
back to her house.

1:13:45.855 --> 1:13:48.756
(pulsing music)

1:13:51.961 --> 1:13:54.462
- And these two are mine.
- Now, are these all things

1:13:54.564 --> 1:13:56.264
you're going to
use at your house?

1:13:57.233 --> 1:13:58.032
- Ah,

1:13:59.202 --> 1:14:00.134
I don't know.

1:14:00.236 --> 1:14:01.702
- Okay, cause it's
not too late to say,

1:14:01.805 --> 1:14:02.670
"You know what?

1:14:02.772 --> 1:14:03.905
"I don't need it either."

1:14:05.141 --> 1:14:07.241
Terri's really struggling
to make fast decisions.

1:14:07.343 --> 1:14:08.476
We're running out of time

1:14:08.578 --> 1:14:09.510
and we need to get
this cleaned up.

1:14:09.612 --> 1:14:13.114
- And yeah, I do want
to keep these, too.

1:14:13.216 --> 1:14:14.482
There's one up here, too.

1:14:18.588 --> 1:14:21.155
(somber music)

1:14:23.159 --> 1:14:24.725
- Hey, Terri.
- Hey.

1:14:24.828 --> 1:14:28.162
- Look who I found outside.
- Cheryl.

1:14:28.264 --> 1:14:30.064
- Cheryl arrives and we
walk into the kitchen

1:14:30.166 --> 1:14:31.599
to look at the progress.

1:14:31.701 --> 1:14:33.201
How are you doing?

1:14:33.303 --> 1:14:34.302
- Um,

1:14:34.404 --> 1:14:37.705
- The conversation is
led to some of the issues

1:14:37.807 --> 1:14:39.974
that have led to
Terri's hoarding,

1:14:40.076 --> 1:14:45.046
which includes the passing
of Terri and Cheryl's mom.

1:14:45.849 --> 1:14:47.048
I'm curious about whether or not

1:14:47.150 --> 1:14:51.953
all the shopping
has been related to

1:14:52.055 --> 1:14:54.255
the grief and loss of your mom,

1:14:54.357 --> 1:14:58.092
and trying to channel
all of those feelings

1:14:58.194 --> 1:14:59.193
into something else,

1:14:59.295 --> 1:15:01.729
so that you just don't
have to think about it.

1:15:04.267 --> 1:15:05.166
- Mom's death was

1:15:05.268 --> 1:15:06.767
a horrible time.
- I know.

1:15:06.870 --> 1:15:08.736
I know.
- A horrible time.

1:15:08.838 --> 1:15:11.105
- I know, especially for you.

1:15:12.609 --> 1:15:17.044
- If your mom saw Roy's
house before we did all this

1:15:17.146 --> 1:15:20.381
and your house, what
do you think she'd say?

1:15:24.287 --> 1:15:26.988
- "I know you mean well, Terri.

1:15:28.458 --> 1:15:31.359
"But you can't live
like this, its not good.

1:15:33.263 --> 1:15:34.462
"You,

1:15:34.564 --> 1:15:36.697
"you got to make some changes.

1:15:39.903 --> 1:15:42.470
"But I know you can to do it.

1:15:42.572 --> 1:15:45.373
"You're strong and
you can do it."

1:15:47.210 --> 1:15:49.810
So, mom would be loving

1:15:49.913 --> 1:15:53.948
and she would probably be
crying as she said it, and

1:15:55.585 --> 1:15:57.385
- You clearly know
your mom very well,

1:15:57.487 --> 1:15:58.753
- Yes.
- Because she has faith

1:15:58.855 --> 1:15:59.720
in you.

1:16:01.558 --> 1:16:03.124
And there's a reason
for that faith.

1:16:03.226 --> 1:16:04.091
- Mhmm.

1:16:05.194 --> 1:16:09.664
- Alright, this was an
important conversation.

1:16:09.766 --> 1:16:10.898
So, let's keep mom in mind,

1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:12.667
- Okay.
- keep Roy in mind,

1:16:12.769 --> 1:16:13.901
let's keep you in mind.

1:16:14.003 --> 1:16:14.869
- Okay.
- Okay?

1:16:14.971 --> 1:16:16.003
And let's do this.

1:16:16.105 --> 1:16:17.138
- Okay.
- Alright.

1:16:17.240 --> 1:16:17.905
- Uh huh.
- Okay.

1:16:18.007 --> 1:16:20.908
(ominous music)

1:16:21.010 --> 1:16:23.744
- That can be away,
and this can go.

1:16:23.846 --> 1:16:26.113
Those can go.
- Okay.

1:16:26.215 --> 1:16:27.582
- This is for me.
- This yours, okay?

1:16:27.684 --> 1:16:28.549
- Uh huh.

1:16:29.652 --> 1:16:30.551
- Yours?

1:16:31.788 --> 1:16:34.255
- So great to see Terri making
some really quick decisions.

1:16:38.294 --> 1:16:39.961
While we're finishing
up at Roy's house,

1:16:40.063 --> 1:16:42.063
half of our crew
is over at Terri's.

1:16:42.165 --> 1:16:44.465
They're making a lot of
progress it sounds like.

1:16:44.567 --> 1:16:47.602
(suspenseful music)

1:16:57.280 --> 1:16:58.613
So, we're done at Roy's house.

1:16:58.715 --> 1:17:00.648
We're going to walk
through with Dr. Zasio

1:17:00.750 --> 1:17:02.750
and let Dr Zasio explain
if she thinks that APS

1:17:02.852 --> 1:17:04.819
will be happy with the results.

1:17:04.921 --> 1:17:07.321
So, this is about as
clean and uncluttered

1:17:07.423 --> 1:17:09.390
as we're going to get it, okay?

1:17:09.492 --> 1:17:12.693
- You've got clear entrance
through the front door.

1:17:12.795 --> 1:17:14.829
You've got clear living room;

1:17:14.931 --> 1:17:17.698
this is clear for
him to move around;

1:17:17.800 --> 1:17:19.734
the kitchen is in order;

1:17:19.836 --> 1:17:22.970
so this will pass for APS.

1:17:23.072 --> 1:17:23.971
- Okay.
- Okay?

1:17:24.073 --> 1:17:25.906
- Thank you.
- So you've done it, Terri.

1:17:26.009 --> 1:17:29.343
You've done it, okay?

1:17:29.445 --> 1:17:30.378
- Now, with that being said,

1:17:30.480 --> 1:17:33.381
we've got to get back
to your house, okay?

1:17:33.483 --> 1:17:35.683
To make sure that that
house is going to pass

1:17:35.785 --> 1:17:37.318
should the county come
by and inspect that.

1:17:37.420 --> 1:17:38.619
So, we need to get going.

1:17:38.721 --> 1:17:39.587
- Okay.
- Yup.

1:17:44.093 --> 1:17:46.027
- [Peggy] Oh, here
comes the cleaning crew.

1:17:50.933 --> 1:17:53.868
(triumphant music)

1:18:09.152 --> 1:18:10.851
- We're putting the final
touches on Terri's house.

1:18:10.953 --> 1:18:11.986
We have the maids cleaning.

1:18:12.088 --> 1:18:14.288
We have all the keep boxes
going into the garage,

1:18:14.390 --> 1:18:15.356
where we made a lot of room.

1:18:15.458 --> 1:18:17.892
It should be ready to go
in just a few minutes.

1:18:18.961 --> 1:18:22.697
(triumphant music continues)

1:18:37.847 --> 1:18:39.880
Well, what do you think?

1:18:45.021 --> 1:18:45.886
Looks like a smile.

1:18:45.988 --> 1:18:46.821
(Terri giggles)

1:18:46.923 --> 1:18:48.923
You have a functioning
kitchen again.

1:18:49.025 --> 1:18:50.124
- Yeah,.
- Spacious.

1:18:50.226 --> 1:18:51.425
- Great.
- No doubt, wonderful.

1:18:51.527 --> 1:18:52.393
- This is amazing.

1:18:52.495 --> 1:18:54.028
- Uh huh.
- It is.

1:18:56.566 --> 1:18:58.599
- So Kraig, does this
look inviting to you?

1:18:58.701 --> 1:19:00.801
- It looks wonderfully
inviting, you betcha.

1:19:00.903 --> 1:19:01.869
- Good.
- No doubt.

1:19:01.971 --> 1:19:03.637
- Having this clean
kitchen, do you say,

1:19:03.740 --> 1:19:05.372
"Oh, but I really
wonder where this is."

1:19:05.475 --> 1:19:07.241
Or is the trade-off worth it?

1:19:07.343 --> 1:19:10.745
- Well, I'm not thinking of
the things that are missing.

1:19:10.847 --> 1:19:11.746
[Everyone] Good.

1:19:11.848 --> 1:19:14.548
- That's a good sign.
- Good Terri.

1:19:14.650 --> 1:19:16.016
- We were able to
make so much progress

1:19:16.119 --> 1:19:17.752
both at Terri's house
and Roy's house,

1:19:17.854 --> 1:19:19.620
that both crises were solved.

1:19:19.722 --> 1:19:21.555
If Code Enforcement
comes to Terri's house,

1:19:21.657 --> 1:19:23.691
they will be completely
happy and sign off on it,

1:19:23.793 --> 1:19:26.227
if Terri manages to keep
it as clean as it is now.

1:19:28.931 --> 1:19:29.797
- Oh.

1:19:34.470 --> 1:19:35.336
- Come on in.

1:19:38.207 --> 1:19:39.006
- Ah, fabulous.

1:19:39.108 --> 1:19:40.708
Now was this my art desk, or?

1:19:40.810 --> 1:19:41.776
- No.
- No.

1:19:41.878 --> 1:19:44.211
We got that, we
got this over here.

1:19:44.313 --> 1:19:46.614
- Got an easel for you,
it's your lighting,

1:19:46.716 --> 1:19:49.450
It's inspiration on the wall.

1:19:49.552 --> 1:19:50.818
- This is an
important room, right?

1:19:50.920 --> 1:19:52.119
- Right.

1:19:52.221 --> 1:19:53.587
- So you can create stuff.

1:19:53.689 --> 1:19:55.289
- Right.
- You now have the space,

1:19:55.391 --> 1:19:56.857
so we want to see
you creating stuff.

1:19:56.959 --> 1:19:59.460
We want that passion,

1:19:59.562 --> 1:20:01.796
that you kind of
switched into collecting,

1:20:01.898 --> 1:20:02.963
- Uh huh.

1:20:03.065 --> 1:20:04.732
- to really be used to what
you're passionate about.

1:20:04.834 --> 1:20:06.000
- Wonderful.
- Okay?

1:20:07.103 --> 1:20:09.804
- She's never had a room
where she had an art studio,

1:20:09.906 --> 1:20:11.906
even when we were kids.

1:20:12.008 --> 1:20:15.109
So, her having a
real studio now,

1:20:15.211 --> 1:20:17.311
I think that's going
to be awesome for her.

1:20:20.149 --> 1:20:20.948
- Oh, wow.

1:20:21.050 --> 1:20:22.283
- Terri.

1:20:22.385 --> 1:20:26.487
(everyone cheering and clapping)

1:20:30.426 --> 1:20:31.125
- Terri?

1:20:31.227 --> 1:20:32.359
- Come on in.

1:20:34.797 --> 1:20:35.462
- Alright.

1:20:35.565 --> 1:20:36.831
- Terrific.

1:20:36.933 --> 1:20:38.465
- Oh.
- Oh, that's so exciting.

1:20:42.305 --> 1:20:44.004
- So yesterday we
were a little nervous

1:20:44.106 --> 1:20:47.408
because the half of this
archway was blocked with boxes.

1:20:47.510 --> 1:20:48.642
- Uh huh.

1:20:48.744 --> 1:20:51.745
- And essentially the room
was filled with furniture.

1:20:51.848 --> 1:20:54.248
And now you and Kraig
have a sitting room,

1:20:54.350 --> 1:20:56.717
you have a TV over there,
you've got your stereo,

1:20:56.819 --> 1:20:58.018
VCR, you can watch movies.

1:20:58.120 --> 1:20:59.887
Couch, chairs, the whole bit.

1:20:59.989 --> 1:21:03.324
- Yes, thanks for all
of your hard work.

1:21:03.426 --> 1:21:05.492
- [Everyone] You're
welcome, Terri.

1:21:05.595 --> 1:21:07.228
- Look at this family!

1:21:07.330 --> 1:21:10.397
(everyone clapping)

1:21:12.535 --> 1:21:13.567
- Alright.

1:21:13.669 --> 1:21:15.369
Kraig, I think we should
turn it over to you,

1:21:15.471 --> 1:21:16.704
- Yes.
- Because this is

1:21:16.806 --> 1:21:18.472
a new beginning for you, too.

1:21:18.574 --> 1:21:19.473
- Yes.

1:21:19.575 --> 1:21:21.642
Terri, you've done
such a wonderful job.

1:21:21.744 --> 1:21:24.245
Terri, your beauty
and talents are so,

1:21:25.481 --> 1:21:29.884
so far exceed the
importance of things.

1:21:29.986 --> 1:21:31.986
We've shared so
much for many years,

1:21:32.088 --> 1:21:35.956
the love and laughs
and tears and cheers.

1:21:36.058 --> 1:21:40.728
It's been 42 or 43, 45,
is more accurately.

1:21:42.565 --> 1:21:45.733
And so Terri dear,
I want to do this.

1:21:45.835 --> 1:21:47.301
- Would you please

1:21:49.105 --> 1:21:51.272
Would you please now marry me?

1:21:53.442 --> 1:21:54.642
- Yes, I will.

1:21:54.744 --> 1:21:58.812
(everyone cheering and clapping)

1:22:02.051 --> 1:22:03.651
- I felt that this
was the perfect time.

1:22:03.753 --> 1:22:07.254
Terri took exceptional steps
to make her house livable,

1:22:07.356 --> 1:22:09.623
and that enabled me
to comfortably

1:22:09.725 --> 1:22:11.825
and genuinely propose.

1:22:11.928 --> 1:22:13.594
(crowd cheering)

1:22:13.696 --> 1:22:15.796
Thank you, thank you.

1:22:15.898 --> 1:22:16.864
- [Everyone] Aw.

1:22:16.966 --> 1:22:19.133
(everyone clapping)

1:22:19.235 --> 1:22:22.970
- Seeing Kraig get down
on one knee was awesome.

1:22:23.072 --> 1:22:26.740
To think that he's
still in love with Terri

1:22:26.842 --> 1:22:28.909
as he was 40
something years ago,

1:22:29.011 --> 1:22:31.278
and that they can finally unite,

1:22:31.380 --> 1:22:33.647
I am ecstatic.

1:22:33.749 --> 1:22:34.548
- Congratulations.

1:22:34.650 --> 1:22:35.249
- Thank you.

1:22:35.351 --> 1:22:36.717
- That was wonderful,

1:22:37.586 --> 1:22:38.285
just wonderful.

1:22:39.689 --> 1:22:40.587
- A little celebration.

1:22:40.690 --> 1:22:43.090
- Time to celebrate,
put these over here.

1:22:44.493 --> 1:22:48.128
- Every chapter of this
story has been about rebirth,

1:22:48.230 --> 1:22:52.466
and we are ending it with
a whole new beginning.

1:22:52.568 --> 1:22:56.870
And on top of that,
Terri is walking away

1:22:56.973 --> 1:22:58.405
with no regrets,

1:22:58.507 --> 1:22:59.974
and that's rare.

1:23:00.076 --> 1:23:01.108
(champaign cork popping)

1:23:01.210 --> 1:23:01.775
- [Everyone] Yay!

1:23:01.877 --> 1:23:03.610
- Cleaning up this house

1:23:03.713 --> 1:23:06.814
represents something
really special with Kraig

1:23:06.916 --> 1:23:11.051
feeling as though he's more
important than my things.

1:23:11.153 --> 1:23:13.721
And it was a perfect
time for him to say,

1:23:13.823 --> 1:23:18.292
"Terri, I'm proud of you
and would you be my wife?"

1:23:19.662 --> 1:23:21.362
That's as sweet as it could be.

1:23:22.365 --> 1:23:24.164
- Cheers to you.
- Cheers!

1:23:27.903 --> 1:23:30.671
(upbeat music)
