00:25.929 --> 00:28.879
What the hell you
burning there, man? Stinks like--

00:30.129 --> 00:31.640
You in the wrong place.

00:32.530 --> 00:35.859
My boys won't be happy when
they see what kind of mess you--

01:09.730 --> 01:13.030
Your name Marquez? Good.
I hate saving the wrong guy.

01:19.930 --> 01:22.879
Never know who you'll meet
in this part of town. Ride?

01:27.730 --> 01:29.549
- Careful.
- Thank you.

02:15.129 --> 02:19.240
New in town, right?
You got that "new in town" look.

02:19.930 --> 02:22.909
It's a dangerous part of town
for a young lady.

02:23.530 --> 02:26.300
Many would take advantage
of this situation.

02:27.129 --> 02:30.080
Especially if you have no money,
no place to stay.

02:31.330 --> 02:33.500
- I might be able to help.
- I'm cold.

02:33.729 --> 02:36.080
Oh, yeah? "Warm" is my middle name.

02:50.530 --> 02:54.180
Now I got money. And a place to stay.

03:00.729 --> 03:02.659
Think I'm gonna like it here.

04:02.770 --> 04:05.680
- Can I take off this blindfold yet?
- No.

04:06.370 --> 04:10.159
- Can I take off something else?
- After I give you your present.

04:13.569 --> 04:16.939
You can never have enough of those.
Come on.

04:32.769 --> 04:34.730
Happy birthday, Angelus.

04:36.370 --> 04:37.910
She's a gypsy.

04:39.970 --> 04:43.379
- I looked everywhere.
- What would I do without you?

04:44.170 --> 04:45.750
Wither and die.

04:48.370 --> 04:51.879
But she's not just for you.
I get to watch.

05:22.569 --> 05:25.410
- Want to live? Do the right thing.
- Right for who?

05:25.569 --> 05:29.920
Next time they come after you, I won't
be there, nor will your friends.

05:32.170 --> 05:35.579
This guy will never do it.
What a waste of a good vision.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.759
- Going badly?
- I knew when you brought him...

05:38.769 --> 05:42.670
...someone with that much body art
has a different idea of civic duty.

05:43.569 --> 05:45.040
After we saved his life?

05:45.970 --> 05:49.129
When was the last time
you wrote a thank you card?

05:49.569 --> 05:51.529
Well, I have faith in Angel.

05:51.970 --> 05:56.540
- He can convince him to testify.
- You don't change a guy like that.

05:57.970 --> 06:00.779
Generally speaking,
you don't change a guy.

06:00.970 --> 06:05.360
What you see is what you get. Scratch
the surface, you find more surface.

06:06.370 --> 06:10.720
- One could have said that about Angel.
- Please. He was cursed by gypsies.

06:12.370 --> 06:16.129
Will Angel get gypsies to shove
a soul down this guy's throat?

06:17.170 --> 06:19.199
The ruffian's already got a soul...

06:19.569 --> 06:22.980
...and, deep down inside,
an urge to do what's right.

06:23.769 --> 06:27.350
- No way, I'm gone.
- Shut up and sit down.

06:27.970 --> 06:30.949
You're right, Wesley.
He's just like the Dalai Lama.

06:32.170 --> 06:35.680
You're gonna have to face
your demons sometime.

06:36.370 --> 06:39.629
- What if I don't want to?
- Then you'll have to face mine.

07:22.610 --> 07:23.730
Excuse me!

07:25.009 --> 07:26.620
Okay. You're excused.

07:28.009 --> 07:30.819
- That's my boyfriend.
- Really?

07:31.610 --> 07:34.379
I don't see your name on him anywhere.

07:35.810 --> 07:39.459
- Billy, do something.
- Yes, Billy, do something. Like this.

08:12.810 --> 08:15.339
While the arguments presented
are entertaining...

08:15.810 --> 08:18.480
...the case hinges on witnesses
they don't have.

08:19.410 --> 08:22.529
If Wolfram and Hart wouldn't
tamper with the witness--

08:23.009 --> 08:25.290
That's a serious allegation.

08:26.009 --> 08:28.709
I'm filing a grievance with the ABA.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.079
They have no witness and no case.

08:32.009 --> 08:34.779
I request a dismissal of all charges.

08:35.009 --> 08:37.220
My client's reputation is damaged.

08:38.009 --> 08:40.850
He's a law-abiding and upstanding...

08:41.610 --> 08:42.480
...citizen.

08:44.009 --> 08:46.850
He is. Except for that "drug
and murder" stuff.

08:47.610 --> 08:50.769
Your Honor, the state
calls Mr. Marquez.

08:55.409 --> 08:56.740
Raise your right hand.

08:57.210 --> 09:01.139
Swear to tell the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth?

09:01.409 --> 09:03.690
I accept full responsibility.
I thought...

09:05.009 --> 09:08.730
...we'd done everything possible.
I didn't foresee the intervention.

09:09.809 --> 09:14.200
Yes, sir. Angel. I don't disagree.
He's proven to be a costly liability.

09:15.210 --> 09:17.840
I can-- Absolutely. I can do that.

09:18.809 --> 09:21.200
Yes, sir. Goodbye.

09:24.210 --> 09:26.809
I hate failure
when there's no one to blame.

09:27.809 --> 09:30.480
I think I've found
the solution to our problem.

09:36.809 --> 09:40.179
Lee, there you are.
Tell them that's our drop-dead offer.

09:40.409 --> 09:43.320
Assure them we mean
literally, not figuratively.

09:44.009 --> 09:45.690
- How you doing?
- Good. You?

09:46.409 --> 09:49.570
Great. I hear you came up
with a good idea.

09:50.009 --> 09:52.429
How to deal with our friendly vampire?

09:53.009 --> 09:56.490
No, it's a great idea.
How did you find out so fast?

09:57.210 --> 10:00.720
Part of my job. How did you
find out about the rogue slayer?

10:01.409 --> 10:04.779
Part of my job. I've been
reading the police reports.

10:05.610 --> 10:09.399
- She's been a busy little beaver.
- But you don't know where she is.

10:09.809 --> 10:12.970
- I will soon enough.
- I already do.

10:17.009 --> 10:21.009
- I'll make the contact.
- It's my deal. I'll make the contact.

10:23.009 --> 10:26.029
- Let me think about it. No.
- Why not?

10:26.610 --> 10:29.840
It's your people skills.
You don't have any.

10:30.809 --> 10:32.629
- You bitch.
- See?

10:33.210 --> 10:35.950
If you behave,
I'll let you ride in the limo.

10:39.210 --> 10:43.039
Unfortunately, we don't
really do divorce cases.

10:44.009 --> 10:46.220
No. It's not about the money.

10:47.610 --> 10:51.539
It's about that much money.
How soon can we meet?

10:52.409 --> 10:54.019
Yeah, I know where that is.

10:56.009 --> 10:58.039
We'll see you there tomorrow.

10:58.409 --> 11:00.620
Thanks for calling. Bye.

11:01.409 --> 11:02.460
How'd it go?

11:04.409 --> 11:06.230
- We won.
- Gang guy testified?

11:06.809 --> 11:09.720
- Stood up and told the truth.
- What did I tell you?

11:09.809 --> 11:12.690
- That he never would.
- Well, more good news.

11:14.009 --> 11:17.450
I may have landed a new client,
and he can afford to pay.

11:18.210 --> 11:19.259
What's the case?

11:20.009 --> 11:24.120
I'm still gathering information,
but we have lunch with him tomorrow.

11:24.809 --> 11:27.370
You happy with the way
things turned out?

11:29.009 --> 11:32.870
You can tell when he's happy.
His scowl is slightly less scowly.

11:34.409 --> 11:38.909
- That kid's lucky he ran into you.
- I pushed him in the right direction.

11:39.809 --> 11:42.440
I wonder how Wolfram and Hart
will push back?

11:48.210 --> 11:52.389
We can go talk, but I'm not much
of a talker. I'm more of a doer.

11:53.009 --> 11:56.169
I think you might have
misunderstood my intentions.

11:57.210 --> 11:59.809
No. I think you misunderstood mine.

12:00.210 --> 12:01.750
I like that watch.

12:03.210 --> 12:04.539
Diamonds, right?

12:05.610 --> 12:08.029
- Faith--
- How do you know my name?

12:09.809 --> 12:11.669
I don't think I told you.

12:12.809 --> 12:15.970
We are well aware of who you are
and what you do.

12:16.409 --> 12:20.980
We know you've had some difficulties.
We can bring order back to your life.

12:21.809 --> 12:23.769
We do, do we? Who is "we"?

12:24.210 --> 12:27.649
Why do they know about me
when I don't know jack about you?

12:28.409 --> 12:32.590
Green is my favorite color,
I look good in diamonds...

12:33.809 --> 12:36.480
...and I love riding in limousines.

12:39.809 --> 12:42.409
Faith, can we talk?

12:47.009 --> 12:47.990
I like black.

13:10.970 --> 13:12.509
Angelus?

13:14.570 --> 13:16.009
Are you here?

13:18.769 --> 13:19.779
Angelus?

13:23.570 --> 13:25.320
Not everyone screams.

13:28.370 --> 13:29.419
What?

13:31.370 --> 13:32.740
When you kill them...

13:33.769 --> 13:37.250
...some just stand there. Frozen.

13:38.570 --> 13:39.620
While others....

13:40.970 --> 13:44.019
What are you doing?
Are we playing a game?

13:47.570 --> 13:50.899
The children. They usually scream.

13:52.970 --> 13:57.500
Yes, they sound just like little pigs.
Have you brought me some?

13:58.970 --> 14:03.539
You don't think I'll share? I can't
believe you think I'm so insensitive.

14:06.169 --> 14:10.029
We've drunk and killed for
how long now, 140-odd years?

14:10.370 --> 14:13.039
We've drunk them all up,
and they're all dead.

14:16.370 --> 14:18.049
- Where have you been?
- Don't!

14:19.970 --> 14:23.480
What is this?
Have you met someone else?

14:31.970 --> 14:34.639
Let go of me. Let go of me!

14:36.769 --> 14:40.100
What happened to you?
Angelus, what happened?

14:40.970 --> 14:43.250
That gypsy girl you brought me.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.600
Her people found out
and did something to me.

14:47.570 --> 14:49.669
- A spell.
- Funny...

14:50.570 --> 14:53.309
...you'd think with all the people...

14:53.570 --> 14:55.919
...I've maimed and killed...

14:56.570 --> 14:59.519
...I wouldn't be able
to remember every single one.

15:02.570 --> 15:03.830
Help me.

15:04.970 --> 15:08.830
The spell. They gave you a soul.

15:10.370 --> 15:11.629
A filthy soul!

15:12.769 --> 15:14.659
- You're disgusting.
- Darla--

15:15.169 --> 15:17.799
- No, get away from me!
- You brought her here.

15:21.769 --> 15:24.679
- I am like you.
- You're not like anything.

15:25.370 --> 15:27.440
Get away from me. Get out!

15:28.370 --> 15:29.529
I'll kill you!

15:46.490 --> 15:51.059
A felony arrest warrant from Sunnydale
was issued in your name. For murder.

15:53.690 --> 15:58.259
Physical description's accurate.
The photo, however, is not flattering.

16:00.289 --> 16:04.860
There's personal stuff too, but they
don't mention that you're a slayer.

16:05.690 --> 16:08.110
Which is why we find you so appealing.

16:08.690 --> 16:13.039
You have a problem, we have a problem.
I had a murder case go up in smoke...

16:14.090 --> 16:17.320
...and you seem to have a certain
expertise in that area.

16:17.690 --> 16:20.460
So to make a long story less long...

16:21.289 --> 16:24.480
...I think if a service is rendered,
we can get you off.

16:24.889 --> 16:27.450
You know how many men
have promised me that?

16:28.490 --> 16:31.190
You won't be disappointed
in our performance.

16:32.690 --> 16:34.409
Who am I supposed to kill?

16:36.289 --> 16:40.360
Understand that we'd never advocate
the killing of another human being.

16:42.889 --> 16:46.009
His name's Angel.
He's somewhat of a private--

16:46.490 --> 16:47.860
No problem.

16:50.090 --> 16:53.139
- Don't you want to know more?
- Besides getting me off...

16:54.289 --> 16:55.899
...how much will you pay?

16:56.690 --> 16:59.919
It might behoove you to know
more about your intended.

17:00.289 --> 17:02.820
So before we discuss remuneration--

17:04.490 --> 17:05.470
Payment.

17:06.890 --> 17:11.460
Make sure you understand this firm
is not connected to anything you do.

17:12.890 --> 17:16.890
It's my ass on the line.
I don't want you to make me look bad.

17:20.089 --> 17:21.559
How do you look now?

17:23.089 --> 17:24.740
She shows initiative.

17:29.089 --> 17:29.960
- Jesse.
- Sir?

17:30.289 --> 17:32.680
Make it three for dinner
instead of four.

17:33.289 --> 17:34.160
Very good, sir,

17:34.490 --> 17:38.140
He's kind of a busy man,
so lunch was the only time he had.

17:39.289 --> 17:42.410
It's not our usual case,
but we must consider finances.

17:42.890 --> 17:46.750
- What kind of demons are they?
- It's not exactly a demon thing.

17:47.690 --> 17:49.549
What kind of "thing" is it?

17:50.089 --> 17:53.529
It's kind of a husband-
and-wife-breakup thing.

17:53.690 --> 17:55.480
- A divorce case?
- You're kidding.

17:56.089 --> 17:58.339
- What's wrong with it?
- It's not what we do.

17:59.089 --> 18:02.210
According to the husband,
the wife's a real witch.

18:03.890 --> 18:06.519
- Seems a bit seedy.
- This is not seedy.

18:06.890 --> 18:09.490
He's in government. Just talk to him.

18:09.890 --> 18:13.960
We pay for lunch. Nothing says
success less than splitting the bill.

18:14.690 --> 18:16.829
- I didn't bring any money.
- Okay, Elvis.

18:17.690 --> 18:19.579
Only big stars don't carry cash.

18:20.089 --> 18:23.740
Speaking of which, one of us
should apply for a business loan.

18:24.289 --> 18:28.259
Just to get us through the rough spot.
What's a 30-year loan to you?

18:32.089 --> 18:33.349
That was so cool!

18:35.690 --> 18:37.089
This is gonna be fun.

18:39.289 --> 18:43.079
- Oh, my God. Faith.
- I thought she was in a coma?

18:44.089 --> 18:45.630
Pretty lively coma.

18:50.329 --> 18:54.650
Giles said she left Sunnydale a
week ago. She's borderline psychotic.

18:55.130 --> 18:57.230
- Explains her outfit.
- This isn't right.

18:58.130 --> 19:00.690
A slayer trying to kill
your boss is wrong.

19:01.130 --> 19:04.710
I meant Giles. Why didn't he warn me?
I was Faith's Watcher.

19:05.329 --> 19:07.960
He should've called
as soon as she awoke.

19:08.329 --> 19:11.910
Maybe he was busy trying to keep her
from killing everybody?

19:12.529 --> 19:16.460
He didn't know she was coming for me.
He was worried about Buffy.

19:17.329 --> 19:19.720
- Is she okay?
- Yeah.

19:21.529 --> 19:23.880
- What can we do?
- Help me track her down.

19:24.529 --> 19:27.789
Check last week's police reports
for beatings, killings.

19:28.730 --> 19:33.119
Possibly near bus stations and bars.
And then you make yourself scarce.

19:34.130 --> 19:38.029
You've been targeted by a psychotic.
I'm not going to run and hide.

19:38.329 --> 19:41.809
- I like the plan where I'm scarce.
- Strength in numbers.

19:42.529 --> 19:44.390
- Two's a number.
- She wants me.

19:44.930 --> 19:47.420
- Don't get in the way.
- But we were a team.

19:47.930 --> 19:51.619
We're not a team. I'm your boss.
You go where I tell you.

19:52.730 --> 19:55.990
- You're taking this personal--
- She shot at my personal back.

19:56.329 --> 19:58.150
Did she do something to Buffy?

19:59.329 --> 20:01.150
Giles just said it was rough.

20:02.930 --> 20:06.900
If you let emotion control
you now, one of you will end up dead.

20:07.130 --> 20:10.710
- That's what she wants.
- She's not a demon, she's a sick girl.

20:11.930 --> 20:15.369
- If there's a chance to reason--
- I had a shot at saving her...

20:15.529 --> 20:17.740
...but some British guy
kidnapped her...

20:18.529 --> 20:20.779
...and made sure
she'd never trust again.

20:21.529 --> 20:25.460
Angel, it's not Wesley's fault
that some British guy ruined your--

20:26.329 --> 20:28.329
Oh, wait. That was you.

20:29.930 --> 20:32.630
- Go on.
- You don't need to.

20:34.130 --> 20:35.569
Let's just get to work.

21:22.730 --> 21:25.569
Hey, baby. Come give us a hug.

21:26.930 --> 21:30.619
I was hoping you'd stop by.
Always good to see old friends.

21:31.730 --> 21:34.119
What's this? Wooden bullets?

21:34.730 --> 21:38.059
Good idea, but no. This is for you.

21:38.930 --> 21:42.339
You know, I'm gonna kill you
slowly and inventively...

21:43.130 --> 21:45.089
...so I'm gonna give you
one chance to--

21:49.730 --> 21:50.990
Blanks.

21:52.130 --> 21:53.109
Nice.

21:53.930 --> 21:56.529
Didn't shoot to kill.
Gotta up the stakes.

21:56.930 --> 21:59.279
- Get you in the game.
- What's the game?

21:59.930 --> 22:01.440
Boredom? Revenge?

22:01.730 --> 22:05.099
I'm getting paid.
They hate you almost as much as I do.

22:05.930 --> 22:08.700
- This might be more fun for me.
- You think?

22:09.529 --> 22:13.710
What if you kill me and experience
that one true moment of pleasure?

22:14.329 --> 22:17.170
I'd get off on that.
Go ahead. Do me.

22:17.930 --> 22:20.319
Let's take that hell ride together.

22:20.930 --> 22:23.559
I'm all yours.
It's an open invitation.

22:24.529 --> 22:27.160
You're pathetic.
You and your tortured soul.

22:28.130 --> 22:31.319
Gotta think everything through.
Think fast, lover.

22:31.730 --> 22:34.079
You don't do me, you know I'll do you.

22:38.329 --> 22:41.240
Gosh. That one wasn't a blank.

22:44.329 --> 22:45.910
Let the games begin.

22:50.569 --> 22:52.569
I'm telling you it's off.

22:52.970 --> 22:56.230
I read the file.
It needs to be handled. I gotta jump.

23:03.769 --> 23:04.930
You...

23:10.970 --> 23:13.109
- ...were in the Gruber meeting.
- Right.

23:13.369 --> 23:17.369
What's going on with them?
Is this a negotiation or a cotillion?

23:18.170 --> 23:19.890
- That's what I told Frank.
- Who?

23:20.569 --> 23:23.339
- Works in contracts.
- The problem's not contracts!

23:24.170 --> 23:27.289
- That's what I was trying to tell--
- Go.

23:27.769 --> 23:28.470
Yes.

23:28.970 --> 23:30.720
Yes. No, no--

23:31.369 --> 23:32.380
Thursday!

23:33.769 --> 23:36.720
We have to close Gruber now
before the stock goes--

23:37.369 --> 23:39.170
- Through the roof!
- In the toilet!

23:39.170 --> 23:41.099
I want to know the instant they fold.

23:42.170 --> 23:43.849
They are folding?

23:44.569 --> 23:47.410
- Gotta go, E-mail me, good to see you.
- You too.

24:36.170 --> 24:39.890
- Have you no respect for the law?
- Nice office. Good view.

24:41.569 --> 24:42.619
Where's Faith?

24:43.369 --> 24:45.859
- What are you talking about?
- Your new hire.

24:46.369 --> 24:50.650
It's a big firm. Personnel will be
glad to handle your problem.

24:51.170 --> 24:53.769
You remember her.
Pretty, dark hair. Kills.

24:54.769 --> 24:57.049
We have strict hiring practices.

24:57.170 --> 24:59.200
How's it work for a guy like you?

25:00.769 --> 25:03.089
Successful lawyer in a big law firm.

25:04.369 --> 25:06.789
Company car. Nice office.

25:07.369 --> 25:10.210
Bonus. Can hire a killing
whenever you want.

25:10.369 --> 25:12.829
We'll add slander
to breaking and entering.

25:13.369 --> 25:17.549
While we're on the subject,
you threw my client through a window.

25:18.769 --> 25:22.279
- Killed him, if I'm not mistaken.
- Yes. I seem to remember.

25:24.170 --> 25:26.450
The window was just about that size.

25:28.970 --> 25:32.450
Too bad the body burned up.
I might've needed a lawyer.

25:33.170 --> 25:37.700
- We have a certain class of clientele.
- I've killed enough people to qualify.

25:38.569 --> 25:39.759
Where is she?

25:40.369 --> 25:44.900
Vampires can't enter without alerting
our sophisticated security system.

25:45.769 --> 25:50.089
Spent a fortune on mystical barriers.
Nice knowing our investment paid off.

25:52.369 --> 25:55.599
- It was a waste of money.
- One down, more on the way.

25:55.970 --> 25:59.690
The police are coming and all this
has been digitally recorded.

26:00.170 --> 26:04.309
Although it'll be entertaining
to watch you fight for your life...

26:05.569 --> 26:08.619
...not to mention the fortune
I can make off the video...

26:09.170 --> 26:10.680
...I do have a dinner.

26:18.769 --> 26:20.730
Good to see you again, Lindsey.

26:21.769 --> 26:23.450
We'll do this real soon.

26:28.369 --> 26:32.410
Just when I think I got you
figured out, you show up in a suit.

26:37.970 --> 26:41.339
There's another assault.
Fight in a bar, arrests made.

26:41.569 --> 26:45.640
A woman fitting Faith's description
was involved but not arrested.

26:46.369 --> 26:47.839
She charmed her way out?

26:48.769 --> 26:51.750
She broke a policeman's jaw
with his own handcuffs...

26:52.369 --> 26:56.720
- ...before she disappeared.
- For Faith, that is charm.

27:03.769 --> 27:07.559
Phantom Dennis, let us in!
It's all right. It's only Wesley.

27:16.369 --> 27:19.319
- Dennis, your ghost, I presume?
- Yes, he's jealous.

27:19.970 --> 27:23.200
Don't worry, hell will freeze over
before we have sex.

27:24.170 --> 27:27.650
Thank goodness for small favors.
I'll call Angel again.

27:28.369 --> 27:32.089
- I'm gonna pack a bag.
- Not too much. We're not on safari.

27:33.170 --> 27:34.779
I got a little problem.

27:36.170 --> 27:38.269
I don't feel Angel's in the game.

27:38.569 --> 27:41.170
But, somehow, I think
you guys are the key.

27:41.569 --> 27:45.259
Now what can I do
to really make him hate me?

27:46.369 --> 27:47.910
- Faith.
- Shut up, Wesley.

27:48.170 --> 27:52.740
- Listen to me. It's not too late.
- For cappuccino? It just keeps me up.

27:53.569 --> 27:58.140
- It's not too late to let me help you.
- Yes. We want to help you.

27:58.970 --> 28:02.299
I realize there have been
failures on both sides.

28:03.170 --> 28:06.650
I also believe in my heart
that you are not a bad person.

28:10.970 --> 28:12.720
What do you believe now?

28:16.970 --> 28:19.569
All right, Wes. My turn.

29:44.130 --> 29:45.950
- Cordelia.
- Oh, Angel.

29:47.730 --> 29:50.710
She was already here. I didn't know.

29:51.329 --> 29:55.720
I made Wesley come with me
just to get a couple of things.

29:56.130 --> 30:00.549
She was like an animal.
She said that you weren't in the game.

30:01.529 --> 30:05.289
- There was nothing we could do.
- Take it easy.

30:06.329 --> 30:07.769
I'm sorry.

30:14.130 --> 30:16.970
- What about Wesley? Is he okay?
- He's not here.

30:42.329 --> 30:46.900
All these little cuts and bruises
just bring out the mother in me.

30:50.130 --> 30:53.180
Come on. Now, now.
Don't poop out on me, damn it.

30:53.730 --> 30:56.569
Otherwise this is all
going to be over too fast.

30:57.329 --> 30:59.960
And you'll be dead and I'll be...

31:01.529 --> 31:02.720
...bored.

31:05.730 --> 31:09.279
Come on, Wesley.
Where's that stiff upper lip?

31:14.730 --> 31:19.230
Now, we've only done one
of the five basic torture groups.

31:20.130 --> 31:21.779
We've done blunt.

31:21.930 --> 31:25.759
But that still leaves sharp,
cold, hot and loud.

31:26.730 --> 31:28.309
Have a preference?

31:32.130 --> 31:36.269
That's great. It's always better
with audience participation.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.690
May I take your order, please?

31:47.130 --> 31:49.019
I was your Watcher, Faith.

31:50.130 --> 31:51.880
I know the real you.

31:53.730 --> 31:57.240
Even if you kill me,
I want you to remember one thing.

31:59.130 --> 32:03.240
- What's that, love?
- You are a piece of shi--

32:03.930 --> 32:05.440
You should talk, huh?

32:06.930 --> 32:09.279
I'll just have to try a little harder.

32:21.930 --> 32:24.000
We'll switch to "sharp" for a while.

32:30.890 --> 32:34.470
On Monday, a guy was beaten here.
His wallet and car stolen.

32:35.089 --> 32:36.670
He's still in the hospital.

32:37.490 --> 32:42.059
Four blocks over is a restaurant where
they had a major fight on Tuesday.

32:42.890 --> 32:47.210
Then here, a guy ran into something
he called "the bitch from hell"...

32:47.690 --> 32:50.809
...who sent him home with paramedics.
That was Wednesday.

32:51.890 --> 32:56.460
This was the first. Took his wallet
and keys. He still in the hospital?

32:57.289 --> 33:00.309
- Yeah. We were gonna talk to him.
- Where does he live?

33:32.690 --> 33:35.710
That's refreshing.
But I'm feeling a little cold.

33:36.289 --> 33:38.180
Why don't we warm the place up?

33:39.890 --> 33:43.579
You wonder if things would've
been different if we never met?

33:44.690 --> 33:48.380
And what if you had Buffy
and Giles had been my Watcher?

33:49.490 --> 33:54.059
Think we'd still be here? Or would
Giles be sitting in that chair?

33:56.690 --> 34:00.019
Or is it just like fate,
where there's no choice?

34:00.890 --> 34:05.240
You were gonna be here no matter what.
Ever think about that stuff?

34:06.890 --> 34:09.449
Fate and destiny?

34:11.690 --> 34:12.739
I don't.

34:20.690 --> 34:23.010
Not that any of this
is your own fault.

34:24.889 --> 34:29.030
Since this may be the last chance
we have to unload on each other...

34:29.690 --> 34:32.989
...it's my duty to say that
had you been a better Watcher...

34:33.889 --> 34:36.420
...I might've been
a more positive role model.

34:41.090 --> 34:43.480
Face it, Wesley.
You really were a jerk.

34:44.090 --> 34:48.659
Walking around like you had a big
stake rammed up your English Channel.

34:51.889 --> 34:54.380
I think I want to hear you scream.

34:56.090 --> 34:57.670
You never will.

35:02.690 --> 35:04.369
Admit it, Wesley.

35:05.090 --> 35:07.760
Didn't you always have
the hots for me?

35:15.289 --> 35:16.619
About time, Soul Boy.

35:17.690 --> 35:19.019
Ready to play now?

35:21.889 --> 35:23.050
I'm ready.

36:02.369 --> 36:05.780
You showed. But how do I know
if you're really in this?

36:05.969 --> 36:09.409
If I kill him, would that help
or just be really funny?

36:10.170 --> 36:12.170
I know what you're after.

36:13.170 --> 36:16.119
You I have to kill.
Wesley's for the hell of it.

36:16.170 --> 36:19.190
- It's not about him. It's about us.
- He's payback.

36:19.769 --> 36:21.769
Why? I thought you were happy.

36:22.769 --> 36:25.400
You never told me how much
I'm worth dusted.

36:25.769 --> 36:29.599
- Fifteen thousand plus expenses.
- You're kidding.

36:30.570 --> 36:33.030
Hey, I'm young.
Willing to work my way up.

36:33.570 --> 36:35.320
You feel young, do you?

36:37.769 --> 36:39.659
You're looking worn-out to me.

36:58.170 --> 37:00.730
That all you got, vampire?
Get in the game.

37:10.769 --> 37:13.159
Come on, Angel!
I thought you were bad!

37:43.170 --> 37:45.449
You can't take me.
No one can take me.

38:04.170 --> 38:05.400
Come on!

38:15.530 --> 38:16.929
You're gonna die!

38:22.130 --> 38:23.210
You hear me?!

38:23.929 --> 38:26.070
You don't know what evil is.

38:30.530 --> 38:31.650
I'm bad.

38:35.929 --> 38:37.260
Fight back!

38:48.530 --> 38:50.039
Nice try, Faith.

38:53.329 --> 38:54.769
I know what you want...

38:56.329 --> 38:58.010
...and I'm not gonna do it.

39:11.329 --> 39:13.360
I won't make it easy for you.

39:14.929 --> 39:18.019
I'm evil! I'm bad! I'm evil!

39:19.130 --> 39:22.079
Do you hear me?! I'm bad!
Angel, I'm bad!

39:23.329 --> 39:26.699
I'm bad! Do you hear me?!

39:27.530 --> 39:30.409
I'm bad! I'm bad!

39:32.329 --> 39:33.380
Please.

39:34.730 --> 39:36.590
Angel, please, just do it.

39:41.329 --> 39:43.119
Please, just do it.

39:43.730 --> 39:45.239
Just kill me.

39:46.730 --> 39:48.130
Just kill me.

39:56.929 --> 39:58.469
It's okay. I'm here.
