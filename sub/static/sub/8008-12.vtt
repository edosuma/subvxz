09:45.251 --> 09:46.252
Kitty!

09:46.461 --> 09:49.385
Best makeover ever!

(MUNCHING)

09:54.886 --> 09:56.012

09:56.096 --> 09:57.222
Mmm.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.147
BUBBLEGUM: Hey, Pep.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.394
Milady?

10:03.520 --> 10:05.522
Are you sure your peepers are all right?

10:05.605 --> 10:08.609
My inner vision is extraordinarily developed.

10:08.775 --> 10:09.901
Okay, great,

10:10.026 --> 10:12.404
'cause I need you to go
into the secret catacombs

10:12.529 --> 10:14.907
and bury this nasty bucket of sludge

10:14.906 --> 10:16.283
in the deep, deep down.

10:16.407 --> 10:18.785
Just be uber-duber careful not to drop it.

10:18.868 --> 10:21.166
Pure vampire essence this powerful

10:21.162 --> 10:23.540
could kaboom reality off its whack.

10:23.915 --> 10:25.041
Don't drop the bucket.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.172
BUBBLEGUM: Exactly.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.418
Will do.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.797
- (ROARS)
- Whoa!

10:30.797 --> 10:32.174
(GROANS)

10:32.257 --> 10:34.134
Ahhh!

10:39.180 --> 10:40.432
(GRUNTS)

10:40.431 --> 10:42.058
(BREATHING H EAVI LY)

10:42.142 --> 10:44.190
No!

10:48.940 --> 10:50.192
Whew!

10:50.692 --> 10:52.194
Mmm, bucky.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.820
No!

11:10.336 --> 11:12.930
(ROARING)

11:26.227 --> 11:28.229
This party is so crazy!
