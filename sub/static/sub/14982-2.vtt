WEBVTT

00:05.120 --> 00:06.370
Oh, bollocks!

00:06.454 --> 00:07.788
Dad, what's going on?

00:07.839 --> 00:09.206
Beans on toast, love.

00:09.291 --> 00:10.591
At 4 A.M.?

00:10.658 --> 00:12.843
Best time of day.

00:14.379 --> 00:16.680
Not bad on the beans,

00:16.765 --> 00:18.933
but more like
beans on crisp.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.186
Yeah. Well, I got a little
distracted, didn't I?

00:22.270 --> 00:26.157
A video of golden eagles
dragging goats off a mountain.

00:26.241 --> 00:27.408
It's brilliant.

00:27.459 --> 00:30.895
Only happens in this
one little tiny part of Spain.

00:30.962 --> 00:33.998
How's the book coming along?

00:34.082 --> 00:37.251
Let's have another whack
at the toast, then, shall we?

00:37.302 --> 00:40.154
Have you even--
have you even tried writing anything?

00:40.222 --> 00:42.973
Just a sentence,
any sentence.

00:43.058 --> 00:45.092
That's what I do when
I can't write a paper.

00:45.143 --> 00:48.012
You can go back to bed
now, love, if you want.

00:48.096 --> 00:51.015
"Happy families
are all alike.

00:51.082 --> 00:52.733
However, every
unhappy family--"

00:52.800 --> 00:54.235
bored.

00:55.487 --> 00:57.938
No, it's very Russian.

00:57.989 --> 00:59.607
You think you can do better?

01:07.999 --> 01:09.700
"Let there be Lightman."

01:11.152 --> 01:12.870
Hire a ghost writer.

01:12.954 --> 01:14.371
Good night, love.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:29.387 --> 01:31.372
Take them away.
Don't need 'em.

01:31.439 --> 01:34.191
All the research
I need is in here.

01:37.011 --> 01:38.729
Perfect. Deaf as a post.

01:38.813 --> 01:39.947
It's just deaf.

01:40.014 --> 01:41.715
No post.

01:45.320 --> 01:47.321
Follow me.

01:47.372 --> 01:49.856
Is Loker in?

01:49.908 --> 01:53.627
Yeah, he's somewhere.
He should be back in a minute.

01:56.831 --> 01:58.532
Sit.

02:01.869 --> 02:03.971
Stay.

02:04.038 --> 02:05.639
The red dot test.

02:05.707 --> 02:07.374
Watch.

02:12.213 --> 02:13.430
Oi!

02:13.515 --> 02:15.683
You sent Mutt and Jeff
to spy on me, didn't you? Hey?

02:15.734 --> 02:18.619
Cal Lightman,
Candice McCallister.

02:18.687 --> 02:19.937
Oh, so you don't deny that?

02:20.021 --> 02:22.573
Sarah and Charles
are here to help you, Cal.

02:22.657 --> 02:23.741
Do you two
need a minute?

02:23.825 --> 02:27.194
You know, I am having
a hard time

02:27.245 --> 02:29.113
writing this book.
Same thing happened on the first one.

02:29.197 --> 02:31.999
You know, the one
that this whole place is built on.

02:32.066 --> 02:36.036
Dr. Lightman, may I say
what a huge fan I am of that book.

02:37.572 --> 02:39.456
Is it Candice with an "i"
or Candace with an "a"?

02:39.541 --> 02:41.675
'Cause Candace with an "a"
I find to be far more classy.

02:41.743 --> 02:43.260
You know what I mean?

02:43.345 --> 02:44.878
We're running late.

02:44.929 --> 02:45.879
What can I do for you?

02:45.930 --> 02:48.265
Um, I thought you said
Dr. Lightman was--

02:48.350 --> 02:50.684
busy. That's exactly
what I said.

02:50.752 --> 02:53.053
Goodbye, Cal.

02:59.060 --> 03:01.595
Oi!

03:01.646 --> 03:03.947
Come in here.
Make yourself useful.

03:04.032 --> 03:05.282
With your book?

03:05.367 --> 03:07.234
What book?

03:07.285 --> 03:09.653
I need to see
Foster's calendar.

03:09.738 --> 03:11.905
You mean hack into
her computer.

03:11.956 --> 03:13.273
Your words, not mine.

03:13.325 --> 03:14.775
Dr. Lightman, I can't
just hack into her--

03:14.826 --> 03:15.876
or you're fired.

03:15.943 --> 03:18.379
Watch my fingers.

03:22.650 --> 03:24.752
It wasn't that hard,
was it?

03:27.255 --> 03:28.472
On your way, then.

03:33.561 --> 03:34.645
Wh--

03:34.729 --> 03:36.497
what--

03:36.564 --> 03:39.483
did--did you do this?

03:39.567 --> 03:41.318
Hey. This is my desk.

03:41.403 --> 03:42.803
I can't hear you.

03:42.854 --> 03:45.856
The red dot test.
He's got you doing the red dot test?

03:45.940 --> 03:48.192
Can you leave me alone now?

03:48.259 --> 03:49.193
Excuse me?

03:49.277 --> 03:51.478
I need to focus.

03:53.331 --> 03:55.199
No, don't worry about me.

03:55.283 --> 03:57.451
I didn't want anything
from the coffee cart.

04:26.698 --> 04:29.316
1, 2, 3, 4.

04:29.367 --> 04:32.536
1, 2, 3, 4...

04:45.199 --> 04:46.717
Oh, Megan!

04:46.801 --> 04:48.335
Your dress!

04:49.421 --> 04:50.721
It's all right, mom.

04:50.805 --> 04:52.723
You can't see it
anywhere. Relax.

04:58.480 --> 04:59.847
Help you, sir?

04:59.898 --> 05:00.898
You lost?

05:00.982 --> 05:03.066
Contestants and parents
only here.

05:04.218 --> 05:06.153
I must have wandered
through the wrong door.

05:06.220 --> 05:07.855
Well, how about you
wander back out again?

05:07.906 --> 05:10.741
Dad, you made my braid
crooked.

05:10.825 --> 05:14.194
I'd jump right
on that if I were you.

05:15.530 --> 05:17.831
How many time have I
told you, Megan,

05:17.899 --> 05:20.617
food is not your friend?

05:27.125 --> 05:28.542
I'm calling security.

05:28.593 --> 05:30.494
I work with the pageant.

05:30.562 --> 05:31.795
Yeah? Doing what?

05:31.880 --> 05:33.096
This and that.

05:33.181 --> 05:34.548
Yeah, thought so.
You're out of here.

05:34.599 --> 05:36.717
Wouldn't you rather
be a soccer mum?

05:36.768 --> 05:39.353
Drs. Foster and Lightman
are here to vet our finalists,

05:39.420 --> 05:42.606
to make sure we are
plastic surgery and drug-free.

05:42.690 --> 05:45.091
Lucky for you

05:45.143 --> 05:47.394
I got writer's block.

05:47.445 --> 05:48.779
So you got into my calendar.
Good for you.

05:48.863 --> 05:50.230
But I've got this covered, Cal.

05:50.281 --> 05:53.317
Who's the favorite

05:53.401 --> 05:55.118
in this little
Freak Show, then?

05:55.203 --> 05:56.320
Freak Show?

05:56.404 --> 05:58.038
And you wonder why
I kept you out of this.

05:58.105 --> 05:59.490
What about you?

05:59.574 --> 06:01.124
Eh?

06:01.209 --> 06:02.626
You the favorite?

06:02.710 --> 06:05.879
She is one, yes,
but nothing is certain.

06:08.049 --> 06:11.051
Well, one thing's
for certain.

06:11.118 --> 06:14.454
It's all gonna go
horribly wrong for someone.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.043
The girl needs help.

06:50.055 --> 06:51.556
And I mean yesterday.

06:51.623 --> 06:54.291
Dr. Lightman, you already
called this a Freak Show.

06:54.343 --> 06:55.309
Correct.

06:55.394 --> 06:58.196
Are you sure
your prejudices

06:58.263 --> 07:01.065
aren't informing
what you're seeing?

07:01.133 --> 07:04.102
Everything this girl does
is deliberate.

07:04.169 --> 07:07.304
Put it this way--

07:07.356 --> 07:08.656
I hope I'm wrong.

07:08.741 --> 07:11.576
These girls are under
a great deal of pressure.

07:11.643 --> 07:13.695
Don't misread that
for something it's not.

07:13.779 --> 07:16.347
When you hear hooves...

07:16.415 --> 07:18.916
Think horses, not zebras.

07:18.967 --> 07:26.274
Either way, it's a stampede.

07:26.358 --> 07:28.726
What are you doing in here?

07:28.777 --> 07:30.111
Job hunting.
You hiding?

07:30.179 --> 07:32.547
Impressive.
On Lightman's laptop

07:32.614 --> 07:33.865
which you took
from his office.

07:33.932 --> 07:36.100
Guess what the first line
of Lightman's book is.

07:36.151 --> 07:38.069
He takes your desk away
and this is how you deal with it.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.955
"Let there be Lightman."

07:41.023 --> 07:42.957
I mean, he is certifiable.

07:43.025 --> 07:45.309
You don't even have the guts
to do this in his office.

07:45.377 --> 07:48.129
You slink away, you hide
in here with his computer.

07:48.197 --> 07:49.230
Poetic justice.

07:49.298 --> 07:51.215
You mean pathetic justice.

07:54.803 --> 07:58.389
All right, come on, Megan,
how many times have we been through this?

07:58.440 --> 07:59.757
Hold that extension...

07:59.808 --> 08:03.528
And now sell the smile,
sell the smile, really sell it.

08:03.595 --> 08:06.063
Mrs. Cross, Megan.

08:06.115 --> 08:07.698
This is
Dr. Cal Lightman.

08:07.766 --> 08:09.867
I'm here for the pre-interview.

08:09.935 --> 08:11.202
New procedure
before the finals,

08:11.269 --> 08:13.604
after some other pageants
had some troubles.

08:14.907 --> 08:16.941
She's going to have to do
a lot better than that.

08:16.992 --> 08:18.376
Mom, can I take a break?

08:18.443 --> 08:20.211
No. Come on.
It's good practice.

08:20.278 --> 08:21.496
Just hold it...

08:21.580 --> 08:23.414
Do go out of your way
to make her miserable?

08:23.465 --> 08:25.333
Excuse me?

08:25.417 --> 08:27.718
Here's another one.

08:27.786 --> 08:31.055
Does she try to look like you,

08:31.122 --> 08:34.592
or do you
try to look like her?

08:34.643 --> 08:37.461
Come on, Megan, let's go.

08:41.015 --> 08:44.986
Mrs. Cross, we specialize in
reading people's emotions.

08:45.070 --> 08:46.971
Well, then I don't
need to tell you how angry I am.

08:47.022 --> 08:47.939
And scared.

08:47.990 --> 08:50.324
Don't forget that part.

08:50.409 --> 08:53.694
You just attacked my mother.
How is she supposed to feel?

09:00.335 --> 09:02.954
You ever think about
ending it all?

09:03.005 --> 09:05.206
What?

09:05.290 --> 09:07.825
Of course not.

09:09.261 --> 09:12.029
Your face
just said yes, love.

09:13.015 --> 09:14.665
You know,
you got a big mouth.

09:14.716 --> 09:16.801
Yep.

09:16.852 --> 09:20.170
She's hiding something
on her shoulder.

09:22.641 --> 09:24.108
You keep your hands
off of my daughter.

09:24.175 --> 09:27.812
My hands
aren't on your daughter.

09:27.863 --> 09:31.515
But someone's have been.

09:31.567 --> 09:34.285
Haven't they, love?

09:35.520 --> 09:38.656
Oh, my God. Megan.

09:40.158 --> 09:41.959
Who did it, love?

09:42.027 --> 09:43.544
Eh?

09:45.080 --> 09:47.999
Who was it, love?

09:50.552 --> 09:52.369
It was him.

09:52.421 --> 09:54.138
It was Mr. Fletcher.

09:55.224 --> 09:56.173
Laura, no.

09:56.225 --> 09:57.258
He touched me.

09:57.342 --> 09:59.043
Megan, no.

09:59.094 --> 10:00.845
He molested me.

10:00.896 --> 10:02.897
No, Megan, don't.

10:02.981 --> 10:04.315
Megan, I--

10:04.382 --> 10:06.934
look, you all know me.
There's no way I could ever--

10:07.019 --> 10:11.022
Laura. Megan, please,
you gotta tell them the truth.

10:12.574 --> 10:16.460
You just rang a bell
you can't unring.

10:16.528 --> 10:19.413
You know that, Megan,
right?

10:19.498 --> 10:22.333
Megan...

10:36.824 --> 10:38.441
You called the wrong number.

10:38.492 --> 10:40.509
You need to call
Child Protective Services.

10:40.562 --> 10:42.645
No, what I need
is a dodgy cop,

10:42.797 --> 10:44.798
who'll keep this
off the record till I say.

10:44.882 --> 10:46.833
Yeah, when is
that fool showing up?

10:46.917 --> 10:50.503
I do need this one.
A man's life just got flushed down the crapper.

10:50.588 --> 10:52.722
Maybe he's got it coming.
Thought of that?

10:52.789 --> 10:54.457
You been drinking,
Detective?

10:54.508 --> 10:56.810
It's called mouthwash,
Professor.

10:56.894 --> 10:58.461
Am I under arrest?

10:58.512 --> 11:00.230
The girl said
you molested her.

11:00.297 --> 11:01.764
Kids lie.

11:01.816 --> 11:04.184
Which one? Be more specific.

11:04.268 --> 11:06.186
Megan. Megan Cross.

11:06.270 --> 11:10.857
All right, say that name
again, without squinting.

11:10.941 --> 11:12.025
Do you wear contacts?

11:12.109 --> 11:13.276
Yeah.

11:13.327 --> 11:16.112
He wears contacts.
See? His contacts are dry.

11:16.163 --> 11:18.832
What, with outrage?
Do me a favor.

11:18.916 --> 11:20.934
Mr. Fletcher,
if there's anything

11:21.018 --> 11:22.385
you're not telling us
about this,

11:22.436 --> 11:24.721
you'll make it a lot easier on
yourself if you just come clean.

11:24.772 --> 11:25.772
Bloody hell.

11:25.856 --> 11:28.441
You people really do talk like that.

11:28.526 --> 11:30.627
Who? Latinos or Poles?

11:30.694 --> 11:32.428
Oh, you mean cops.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.647
Did you push her?

11:34.732 --> 11:36.166
Did you shove her?

11:36.233 --> 11:38.067
Did you hit her?
Did you, you know,

11:38.118 --> 11:40.987
hold her down?

11:41.071 --> 11:42.655
A little bit
of everything, really.

11:42.740 --> 11:46.292
If you want to know
about Megan,

11:46.360 --> 11:48.378
talk to her mother.

11:48.445 --> 11:52.298
Well, he didn't molest
that girl.

11:52.383 --> 11:54.083
You want to walk me through
your thinking on that?

11:54.134 --> 11:55.802
In a word, no.

11:55.886 --> 11:57.670
How sure are you?

12:01.258 --> 12:03.476
You can go, Mr. Fletcher.

12:06.814 --> 12:08.898
Answer your question?

12:11.986 --> 12:13.486
I'm not letting
the pageant go down.

12:13.571 --> 12:14.904
Neither is the magazine.

12:14.972 --> 12:17.907
All right. Uh,
don't let him leave,

12:17.975 --> 12:19.976
all right?
He's hiding something.

12:20.027 --> 12:22.478
So is Megan,
by the way.

12:22.530 --> 12:23.980
I can't guarantee
his safety.

12:24.031 --> 12:25.365
Oh, don't be such a girl.

12:25.449 --> 12:26.533
Tell them to get a life.

12:26.617 --> 12:27.951
I beg your pardon?

12:28.002 --> 12:30.169
The magazine people.

12:30.254 --> 12:32.956
Is it helpful
in what you do

12:33.007 --> 12:34.591
to be so prejudiced?

12:36.427 --> 12:38.878
Look, I come here

12:38.963 --> 12:40.547
and I spotted a girl
who feels the same way

12:40.631 --> 12:41.965
about your pageant
as I do,

12:42.016 --> 12:43.466
so, I would say, yes,

12:43.517 --> 12:45.835
in this case
it is helpful.

12:45.886 --> 12:46.886
What was that about?

12:46.971 --> 12:49.606
Candice with an "i,"
not an "a." I knew it.

12:51.642 --> 12:53.693
Let's go tag-team them up.

12:53.777 --> 12:56.896
Forgive me, but if a man touched
a child of mine,

12:56.981 --> 12:58.681
particularly
in a sexual way--

12:58.749 --> 13:00.900
you heard my mom.
We're not filing charges.

13:00.985 --> 13:02.001
Did Thomas
admit anything?

13:02.069 --> 13:02.936
No.

13:03.003 --> 13:04.304
Then it's his word
against ours.

13:04.371 --> 13:06.355
If you don't mind
my saying, Megan,

13:06.407 --> 13:09.025
you seem very calm
and composed.

13:09.076 --> 13:10.543
He just groped me, ok?

13:10.628 --> 13:13.580
No, it's not ok.

13:13.664 --> 13:15.298
You're 16 years old.

13:15.365 --> 13:16.866
It's just a bruise.

13:16.934 --> 13:18.084
We're fine.

13:18.168 --> 13:19.469
We?

13:21.338 --> 13:24.691
All right, Megan,
one more time.

13:31.315 --> 13:33.600
Every look, every word
is in lock-step.

13:33.684 --> 13:35.735
They're a perfect symbiosis.

13:35.819 --> 13:38.354
Yeah, except she's dying
to get away from her mum.

13:38.405 --> 13:40.657
Laura even uses
the royal we.

13:40.724 --> 13:42.492
There's no separation
of mother and daughter.

13:42.559 --> 13:45.161
I've never seen two people
so on the same page.

13:45.228 --> 13:48.414
Let's tear the page
in half.

13:58.208 --> 14:01.461
I can see why
you're the favorite.

14:03.097 --> 14:05.264
I thought we were done here.

14:06.100 --> 14:07.717
Mrs. Cross, if Megan

14:07.768 --> 14:09.602
is a victim of molestation,

14:09.687 --> 14:11.638
you need to deal with that.

14:11.722 --> 14:13.189
We don't dwell
on the negative.

14:13.256 --> 14:14.891
It shows through
to other people.

14:14.942 --> 14:16.092
Like the judges.

14:16.143 --> 14:19.062
We've been preparing
for this pageant for years.

14:19.113 --> 14:21.147
If this were the Olympics,
no one would question her desire

14:21.231 --> 14:22.865
to keep her head in the game.

14:22.933 --> 14:24.450
Your daughter
has suffered a trauma.

14:24.535 --> 14:27.770
She needs to talk about it so that
she can regain control.

14:31.992 --> 14:33.493
Stealing?

14:33.577 --> 14:36.045
Yeah, it tastes better
that way.

14:37.748 --> 14:40.333
You let Mr. Fletcher go.

14:40.417 --> 14:43.252
Yep. Lack of evidence.

14:43.303 --> 14:45.621
Interesting.

14:45.673 --> 14:47.890
You don't seem
too bothered by that.

14:47.958 --> 14:51.177
I can't afford to let it.

14:51.261 --> 14:53.646
Let it what?
Ruin your chances

14:53.731 --> 14:55.581
of being Miss Freak Show
cover girl?

14:55.649 --> 14:57.650
God.

14:57.735 --> 14:59.268
You asked for me help.

14:59.319 --> 15:01.187
No, I didn't.

15:01.271 --> 15:04.123
Well, at very least,
you asked for my full attention.

15:04.191 --> 15:08.244
Right before you were
pointing a finger at Fletcher.

15:09.346 --> 15:11.080
Megan.

15:11.148 --> 15:12.782
Mommy's calling.

15:12.833 --> 15:14.617
Rehearsal.

15:23.077 --> 15:25.178
Right.

15:29.933 --> 15:31.517
Sorry to interrupt.

15:31.602 --> 15:34.020
You said to let you know
when they got here?

15:37.024 --> 15:38.507
Has Loker been in here?

15:38.559 --> 15:40.810
Loker?

15:40.861 --> 15:41.811
Yeah. When I was out.

15:41.862 --> 15:43.529
'Cause, you know...

15:46.784 --> 15:48.067
I can smell him.

15:48.152 --> 15:51.454
He calls it
eau du toilette.

15:51.521 --> 15:53.372
French.

15:53.457 --> 15:55.541
French.

15:55.626 --> 15:58.294
One way of putting it,
I suppose.

16:01.548 --> 16:03.249
One of my pens
is missing.

16:09.890 --> 16:11.090
Hello, gents.

16:11.175 --> 16:12.725
They said
we had to come here

16:12.810 --> 16:14.677
or I was out of
the competition.

16:14.728 --> 16:17.180
Megan, have you told
your mum yet?

16:17.231 --> 16:18.898
Told me what?

16:20.901 --> 16:22.935
That's all right.
No need. It can wait.

16:24.021 --> 16:25.321
You...With me.

16:25.388 --> 16:28.357
You...You're with
the delightful Dr. Foster.

16:32.696 --> 16:37.250
It was the, uh, the end of the first day
of the competition.

16:37.334 --> 16:40.753
Mr. Fletcher has this...RV.

16:40.838 --> 16:43.372
And you were inside his RV?

16:43.423 --> 16:45.258
Yeah.

16:45.342 --> 16:46.742
It's pretty big.

16:46.794 --> 16:49.045
And, uh, you know,

16:49.096 --> 16:51.697
we hang out there sometimes
during competitions.

16:51.765 --> 16:53.332
We got to know him
and Deedee pretty well.

16:53.400 --> 16:56.719
So it wouldn't have been
unusual for you and Mr. Fletcher

16:56.770 --> 16:58.354
to be alone together?

16:58.421 --> 17:00.923
Not really, no.

17:00.991 --> 17:04.193
When it happened,
I, uh--yeah,

17:04.261 --> 17:06.145
he could see
that I'd been upset,

17:06.230 --> 17:08.330
you know,
that I'd been crying.

17:08.397 --> 17:09.397
And, uh...

17:09.449 --> 17:12.617
So when was this,
Megan?

17:12.703 --> 17:16.321
Day before yesterday.

17:16.406 --> 17:18.508
And, uh...

17:18.575 --> 17:21.410
You know, I messed up
my personal interview.

17:21.461 --> 17:24.497
And Mr. Fletcher said that,
you know, it wasn't fair.

17:24.580 --> 17:26.915
He was--he was
comforting me, you know?

17:26.983 --> 17:28.734
And then...

17:30.637 --> 17:34.290
Then he put his hand...

17:34.341 --> 17:36.592
On my neck.

17:38.979 --> 17:41.814
And I just thought
he was being nice.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.637
She didn't come to you?

17:48.689 --> 17:50.773
No. I had no idea.

17:50.824 --> 17:53.159
Then what happened?

17:55.612 --> 17:59.248
And then...

18:02.836 --> 18:04.287
Megan...

18:05.439 --> 18:08.374
You have nothing
to be ashamed of.

18:10.294 --> 18:12.862
It's important
that you know that.

18:12.930 --> 18:15.648
Take your time.

18:17.401 --> 18:19.485
And then he touched me.

18:19.570 --> 18:21.871
Molested me.

18:21.938 --> 18:23.906
I tried to push him away.

18:23.957 --> 18:25.658
That's enough.
I'm not going to watch

18:25.742 --> 18:27.243
my little girl
in pain anymore.

18:27.294 --> 18:30.580
Tell yourself
what you like, love.

18:30.631 --> 18:32.665
But that in there,
that's not pain.

18:32.749 --> 18:35.951
That's...
That's not even close there.

18:37.337 --> 18:38.971
She's enjoying herself.

18:39.039 --> 18:40.556
Is that how
you got the bruises?

18:40.624 --> 18:42.441
Yeah.

18:45.395 --> 18:47.129
And then I kicked him

18:47.180 --> 18:49.265
and broke free.

18:50.967 --> 18:53.819
She's getting off
on your pain.

18:55.839 --> 18:58.708
First Fletcher, now her mother.

18:58.775 --> 19:00.275
She's a sadist.

19:00.327 --> 19:01.877
She's a bloody
emotional vampire.

19:01.945 --> 19:03.112
The case still remains,

19:03.163 --> 19:04.580
Fletcher did do something
to her in that RV.

19:04.631 --> 19:07.116
We need to involve
the police, the real ones.

19:07.167 --> 19:08.283
Spoilsport.

19:08.335 --> 19:09.785
Dr. Lightman.

19:09.836 --> 19:11.721
My pageant's about
to go up in flames.

19:11.788 --> 19:15.675
Down in flames,
up in smoke.

19:17.511 --> 19:20.462
Two more girls
just came forward.

19:20.514 --> 19:24.299
They both say Thomas Fletcher
touched them inappropriately.

19:27.688 --> 19:28.971
Right.

19:36.891 --> 19:38.675
You call this
off the record, do you?

19:38.705 --> 19:40.873
We have 24 hours, and then we have
to do the paperwork.

19:40.958 --> 19:42.508
Right?

19:44.177 --> 19:45.962
What's all this?

19:46.013 --> 19:47.380
Deedee, can you step
over here, please?

19:47.464 --> 19:48.848
For what?

19:48.932 --> 19:50.933
Do as she says, love.

19:51.001 --> 19:53.135
We're taking her into custody.
Social Services.

19:53.203 --> 19:54.387
Like hell you are.

19:54.471 --> 19:55.805
Guys.

19:55.856 --> 19:57.339
Hey, back off.
Wait!

19:57.391 --> 19:59.358
Get off me!
Dad!

19:59.443 --> 20:01.060
Dad!
Deedee!

20:01.144 --> 20:02.862
Dad!
I'm gonna help him, love.

20:02.946 --> 20:03.980
Daddy!
Son of a bitch.

20:04.031 --> 20:05.231
Just until we get
this cleared up.

20:05.315 --> 20:06.315
Dad!

20:06.366 --> 20:07.650
Get--

20:07.701 --> 20:08.868
where are you taking her?

20:08.952 --> 20:11.153
Somewhere safe,
I promise you that.

20:11.204 --> 20:12.705
Don't take my...

20:12.789 --> 20:13.689
I'm innocent.

20:13.740 --> 20:16.042
You know I'm innocent.

20:16.126 --> 20:17.793
Deedee!

20:22.666 --> 20:24.967
Oh, my God...

20:25.035 --> 20:26.469
Two more girls came forward.

20:27.671 --> 20:30.039
I gotta talk to Laura.

20:30.090 --> 20:31.540
Oh, now he tells me.

20:31.591 --> 20:32.875
Tell you what?

20:32.926 --> 20:35.811
Ok, look, we used to be
more than just friends.

20:35.879 --> 20:39.381
And so now you think she's gonna
want to help you out, eh,

20:39.433 --> 20:41.651
all of a sudden?

20:43.219 --> 20:45.888
These are memories
from the road, then?

20:45.939 --> 20:48.891
Yeah. After my wife died,
I sold the house.

20:48.942 --> 20:50.359
Too much history.

20:50.410 --> 20:53.029
Anyway, this thing's
pretty handy

20:53.080 --> 20:54.997
when it comes to the pageant.

20:55.065 --> 20:57.500
Yeah, and for a bit
of the other,

20:57.567 --> 21:00.419
when the girls are off
lying about world peace.

21:00.504 --> 21:02.738
You mean Laura and me.

21:02.789 --> 21:05.074
There's no crime
in being lonely.

21:06.076 --> 21:09.845
Well, Megan
would beg to differ.

21:09.913 --> 21:11.180
Wait a minute.

21:11.247 --> 21:13.015
Megan came by
the other day.

21:13.083 --> 21:15.017
I didn't think anything of it at the time.
I didn't think--

21:15.085 --> 21:16.535
did she come on to you?

21:16.603 --> 21:17.837
I turned her down.

21:17.904 --> 21:20.189
I tried to be nice
about it.

21:20.240 --> 21:22.357
She went crazy.
She grabbed a pair of scissors sitting here,

21:22.409 --> 21:24.326
she came at me
and I grabbed her,

21:24.378 --> 21:27.830
I wrestled t
out of her hands and...Ohh...

21:27.881 --> 21:30.066
That's how she got
the bruises?

21:37.224 --> 21:40.893
Still, Megan's getting
what she wants. Eh?

21:40.977 --> 21:43.429
Your pain.

21:47.150 --> 21:49.235
Are you really going to take
Lily out of the pageant?

21:49.319 --> 21:51.654
If my daughter said
he touched her, he touched her.

21:51.721 --> 21:54.556
Are you more worried
about the girls who've come forward

21:54.608 --> 21:56.325
or about your pageant?

21:58.662 --> 22:00.729
Oh, wait, wait.

22:00.781 --> 22:03.282
Fletcher!
My daughter, Fletcher?

22:03.366 --> 22:05.400
They're making it up.

22:05.452 --> 22:07.670
All of them?

22:14.628 --> 22:17.379
One thing
I know for sure--

22:17.431 --> 22:18.431
can-dice--

22:18.515 --> 22:20.249
is that abusers

22:20.300 --> 22:23.385
of the kind that we're
talking about here,

22:23.437 --> 22:26.439
lack that kind
of self-control.

22:35.649 --> 22:38.734
Uh, we finished the red dot test,
Dr. Lightman.

22:38.785 --> 22:41.153
Loker actually
told us what it was.

22:41.238 --> 22:42.488
You did it, too,
did you?

22:42.572 --> 22:43.405
Yeah.

22:43.457 --> 22:44.490
That's keen.

22:44.574 --> 22:46.158
Yeah.
10 hours long.

22:46.243 --> 22:48.110
2 dots, 10 hours.

22:48.161 --> 22:49.411
Actually, there were 3.

22:49.463 --> 22:50.579
Right.

22:50.630 --> 22:52.832
Excellent.
Congratulations.

22:52.916 --> 22:53.966
How many dots were there?

22:54.050 --> 22:55.634
I don't know.
I've never finished it.

22:55.719 --> 22:57.119
Then what was the point?

22:57.170 --> 23:00.005
Each dot represents
a micro-expression.

23:00.073 --> 23:02.258
What did she just say?

23:02.309 --> 23:04.310
Hilarious.

23:04.394 --> 23:07.296
Could you take Mr. Fletcher
to my office

23:07.347 --> 23:09.765
and make sure
he gets some rest.

23:12.769 --> 23:15.971
This is a local pageant
from last year.

23:18.241 --> 23:19.692
See how she smiles?

23:19.776 --> 23:21.443
Even though she lost.

23:21.495 --> 23:24.163
The winners cry
and the losers smile.

23:24.247 --> 23:27.533
Losers want to appear
gracious, winners want to--

23:27.617 --> 23:28.534
is that it?

23:28.618 --> 23:29.702
No.

23:29.786 --> 23:32.087
No. You need to see this.

23:39.546 --> 23:42.014
I wonder how long
she practiced that dive.

23:42.082 --> 23:43.665
Triumph at losing.

23:43.717 --> 23:45.835
You don't see that
every day.

23:45.902 --> 23:51.056
Do you know how to create
a disturbed personality?

23:51.141 --> 23:53.559
Constant criticism

23:53.643 --> 23:56.445
and lack of affection.

23:56.512 --> 23:58.480
Works like a charm,
that does.

23:58.532 --> 24:01.450
You mean like
how you treat Loker?

24:02.736 --> 24:04.553
Who?

24:07.958 --> 24:10.626
This chair taken?

24:12.028 --> 24:13.746
You didn't say he was coming.

24:13.830 --> 24:15.530
If you thought
that was bad,

24:15.582 --> 24:16.882
wait till you see this.

24:16.967 --> 24:18.367
Wait for what?

24:18.418 --> 24:19.752
Megan?

24:19.836 --> 24:21.503
Look, I just want
to talk for a second, ok?

24:21.555 --> 24:23.222
She has nothing
to say to you.

24:23.306 --> 24:26.725
They took Deedee,
and if you don't tell the truth,

24:26.810 --> 24:28.811
I may never get her back.

24:34.651 --> 24:37.136
You do see what
I'm talking about, don't you?

24:37.204 --> 24:38.938
I don't see anything.

24:39.022 --> 24:41.190
What are you two
talking about?

24:41.241 --> 24:44.193
To be honest, this isn't the way,
Dr. Lightman.

24:44.244 --> 24:47.413
Is he trying to get you
to disqualify us from the pageant?

24:47.497 --> 24:48.897
Us?

24:48.949 --> 24:50.783
You are trying
to disqualify us.

24:50.867 --> 24:54.069
Your daughter's
feeding off your pain,

24:54.120 --> 24:55.754
Mrs. Cross.

24:55.839 --> 24:59.741
Do you ever wonder why
he just went cold on you?

24:59.793 --> 25:02.911
Megan knows why I stopped calling,
Laura, don't you, Megan?

25:02.963 --> 25:04.546
Megan is a victim here.

25:04.598 --> 25:06.048
You're blaming the victim?

25:06.116 --> 25:08.083
I'm the one
with all the bruises.

25:08.134 --> 25:10.970
Pain is your daughter's
drug of choice.

25:11.054 --> 25:13.472
Isn't that right, Megan?

25:13.556 --> 25:17.559
Mr. Fletcher here,
his pain's like crack to you.

25:17.611 --> 25:21.447
Good news--he can get
away from her.

25:21.531 --> 25:24.099
Bad news--you can't.

25:24.150 --> 25:26.268
Enjoy the Freak Show.

25:28.438 --> 25:29.538
He touched my hair

25:29.606 --> 25:32.291
and the back of my neck,

25:32.359 --> 25:34.376
like he was comforting me.

25:34.444 --> 25:36.528
At first I thought
he was being friendly.

25:36.596 --> 25:38.897
Then I felt sick.

25:38.965 --> 25:41.800
My hands went numb.

25:41.868 --> 25:44.486
I couldn't catch my breath.

25:47.274 --> 25:48.557
Thank you, Ashley.

25:48.624 --> 25:50.559
Can you give us a minute?

25:58.768 --> 26:01.353
She said the exact same thing
as the first girl.

26:01.438 --> 26:02.821
Word for word.

26:02.906 --> 26:07.276
There are also unmistakable language
similarities to Megan.

26:10.080 --> 26:12.498
Wallowski.

26:12.582 --> 26:15.000
For how long?

26:21.207 --> 26:23.542
Now what?

26:23.610 --> 26:24.843
Megan's missing.

26:24.928 --> 26:26.845
She went for a walk
and never came back.

26:31.403 --> 26:33.705
Where's Megan?!

26:36.593 --> 26:38.962
Tell your friend in there
he's a coward!

26:38.971 --> 26:41.672
Oh, what, like men who hide behind
their wives, you mean?

26:45.685 --> 26:47.953
You took away my desk,

26:48.021 --> 26:49.538
so here I am.

26:49.623 --> 26:51.407
Where's my pen?

26:51.491 --> 26:53.209
Your pen?

26:53.293 --> 26:55.461
Yeah, the one you stole
off my desk. My pen.

26:55.528 --> 26:57.196
Are you kidding me?

27:01.968 --> 27:04.637
Rumor travels fast.

27:05.705 --> 27:08.057
Your point being?

27:08.141 --> 27:10.559
One of these people
or one of their daughters

27:10.644 --> 27:13.395
has got to know
where Megan is.

27:13.480 --> 27:15.347
Have you thought of that?

27:37.671 --> 27:39.171
What?

27:39.239 --> 27:40.956
What?

27:41.041 --> 27:43.575
I thought I saw
a look there.

27:45.428 --> 27:48.013
Hey. Fletcher, police.

27:50.100 --> 27:52.518
Come out
of there, bastard.

27:54.354 --> 27:56.889
Dr. Lightman, it just
came over the radio.

27:56.940 --> 27:59.391
His daughter Deedee's
in intensive care, hurt bad.

27:59.442 --> 28:01.777
I'm taking him
to the hospital now.

28:01.861 --> 28:03.279
What happened
to her?

28:03.363 --> 28:04.897
I don't know.
It could be self-inflicted.

28:04.948 --> 28:06.949
Don't quote me on that.

28:19.579 --> 28:21.397
Pen.

28:25.585 --> 28:27.920
Thief.

28:42.468 --> 28:44.469
Now, then, Megan.

28:44.521 --> 28:46.989
Where's Deedee?

28:47.073 --> 28:49.491
What, you're
disappointed, are you?

28:49.576 --> 28:51.977
You're the face reader.

29:01.955 --> 29:05.624
Is this how it
happened with Fletcher?

29:05.675 --> 29:06.875
Come on, Dr. Lightman,

29:06.960 --> 29:09.962
you're the one
that lured me here.

29:14.184 --> 29:17.720
You wrecked Fletcher's life.

29:19.222 --> 29:22.057
Now you're trying to
do the same with me, is that it?

29:22.142 --> 29:26.278
I like you better
than him. You get me.

29:27.981 --> 29:29.982
Open your hand.

29:35.021 --> 29:37.072
Do you prefer cutting up

29:37.157 --> 29:40.409
or inflicting pain
on other people?

29:40.493 --> 29:42.378
Hmm?

29:42.462 --> 29:45.547
Show me what you got.

29:54.257 --> 29:57.343
Let's get you out of here,
shall we?

29:57.394 --> 29:59.678
I know what
you're trying to do.

29:59.729 --> 30:02.264
I don't need any help.

30:02.349 --> 30:04.549
I got you.

30:04.601 --> 30:07.436
But you can't tell anyone.

30:07.520 --> 30:10.189
You do...

30:12.275 --> 30:15.411
I'll say you attacked me.

30:18.915 --> 30:20.582
Hang on a sec.

30:23.002 --> 30:25.087
Go on in.

30:26.589 --> 30:28.257
That was just lovely.

30:28.341 --> 30:31.677
Tell that
to Thomas Fletcher.

30:34.347 --> 30:35.631
Megan!

30:46.810 --> 30:48.760
Deedee brought
that to me today.

30:48.812 --> 30:50.312
I found out where
Megan kept it hidden.

30:50.397 --> 30:51.563
The other girls told me.

30:51.631 --> 30:53.265
I'm so sorry, honey.

30:53.316 --> 30:55.484
Maybe it's not too late
to get you back into the finals.

30:55.568 --> 30:58.320
After what they did
to you, forget it.

30:58.405 --> 31:01.123
"He touched my hair,
the back of my neck.

31:01.207 --> 31:02.741
"I felt sick.
My hands went numb.

31:02.792 --> 31:04.609
I couldn't catch
my breath."

31:04.661 --> 31:06.078
Sound familiar?

31:06.129 --> 31:07.746
Who else knew
about this diary?

31:07.797 --> 31:10.365
Ashley and Ellen.
And now me.

31:10.433 --> 31:12.334
That explains their
similar language.

31:12.419 --> 31:14.453
Here's one.

31:14.504 --> 31:17.339
"Went to see <i>Back to</i>
<i>the Future</i> with Joyce.

31:17.424 --> 31:20.426
First in the school
to see it."

31:21.478 --> 31:24.263
It's not Megan's diary,
it's her mum's.

31:25.515 --> 31:27.566
A lot of dog-eared pages.

31:27.633 --> 31:30.436
She's been getting off
on her mum's pain night after night.

31:30.487 --> 31:33.505
It's how she survives
between victims.

31:33.573 --> 31:35.491
Or pageants.
Where she can inflict

31:35.575 --> 31:38.477
the most pain
on the most people.

31:38.528 --> 31:41.914
And we took all that
away from her.

32:22.045 --> 32:24.964
My mum killed herself.

32:26.666 --> 32:28.950
With pills.

32:32.095 --> 32:33.895
You try to make sense
of it.

32:35.431 --> 32:37.582
Then you just move on.

32:42.105 --> 32:45.924
No one could ever
hurt me like she did.

32:46.993 --> 32:51.062
Your mum will move on.

32:51.114 --> 32:56.084
Yeah. After a while,
she'll move on...

32:56.169 --> 32:59.521
If you take that dive.

33:03.760 --> 33:08.513
It sounds cold,
but it's the truth.

33:09.599 --> 33:12.384
Your mom really kill herself?

33:12.435 --> 33:15.137
Oh, yeah.

33:18.775 --> 33:21.943
Silly Cal, right?

33:27.300 --> 33:29.785
I know about the diary.

33:33.039 --> 33:36.741
Now, that's good.
Anger.

33:37.877 --> 33:41.863
It means you feel something
other than pain.

33:47.003 --> 33:53.158
She could never stand it
if I had a hair out of place.

33:53.226 --> 33:56.628
She'd go to bed for days.

33:56.679 --> 33:59.431
There'd be no food.

33:59.499 --> 34:01.850
She wouldn't talk.

34:03.686 --> 34:07.539
No wonder
I never met my dad.

34:13.496 --> 34:15.597
Look.

34:15.665 --> 34:19.534
If you really want
to hurt your mum...

34:19.619 --> 34:22.370
And her bloody
pageant...

34:22.438 --> 34:26.708
No one does that stuff
better than me.

34:30.362 --> 34:32.880
"Teenstyle" magazine
would like to thank

34:32.965 --> 34:35.016
all of our participants
for making this pageant

34:35.101 --> 34:38.168
a special occasion
for all of us.

34:38.221 --> 34:40.804
In just a moment,
I'll be handed...

34:40.857 --> 34:44.492
She shouldn't even
be back here, you know.

34:44.577 --> 34:47.245
Well, it's the best
I could do, you know,

34:47.295 --> 34:48.580
to get her down
off the ledge,

34:48.630 --> 34:51.498
'cause, of course,
I didn't have a shrink handy.

34:52.635 --> 34:55.170
And now,
after all the talent,

34:55.254 --> 34:57.672
after all the poise
and beauty,

34:57.757 --> 35:00.291
we come to the big moment.

35:01.561 --> 35:05.513
Who will be
Miss "Teenstyle" Magazine?

35:05.581 --> 35:09.467
Whose face will grace
next month's cover?

35:09.518 --> 35:14.706
Our third runner-up
and second-place winner is...

35:14.774 --> 35:17.859
Miss Oregon,
Emily Tunney.

35:17.944 --> 35:18.860
Congratulations.

35:23.916 --> 35:28.003
Our first runner-up
and second-place winner is...

35:35.628 --> 35:38.763
Miss Connecticut,

35:38.814 --> 35:40.432
Megan Cross.

35:44.737 --> 35:49.024
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Texas is your winner!

35:49.108 --> 35:51.493
Congratulations.

35:53.663 --> 35:56.615
Isn't she beautiful?

35:56.666 --> 36:00.118
Miss "Teenstyle" Magazine!

36:00.169 --> 36:02.287
Beautiful!

36:02.338 --> 36:05.624
Congratulations.

36:26.690 --> 36:28.474
How you doing?
You all right?

36:32.099 --> 36:33.733
He touched my hair,

36:33.817 --> 36:36.602
the back of my neck.

36:36.687 --> 36:40.072
I felt sick.

36:40.157 --> 36:42.942
Where did you get that?

36:47.752 --> 36:49.152
Here love.

36:52.286 --> 36:54.036
Mom.

36:56.907 --> 36:58.925
I found it in your closet.

36:59.009 --> 37:02.962
She was telling your story,
wasn't she?

37:04.598 --> 37:06.749
I'm done with pageants.

37:06.800 --> 37:09.018
Well, honey, I know
this hurts right now.

37:09.085 --> 37:10.186
Oi!

37:10.253 --> 37:12.672
Will you knock it off.

37:13.607 --> 37:16.108
I'm not doing this
anymore, mom.

37:16.193 --> 37:19.612
I'm not putting on a fake smile
to music I don't even like.

37:19.696 --> 37:24.600
I'm not--I'm not pretending that
I want to save the world. I'm--

37:24.651 --> 37:26.519
you can't do this to us.

37:26.587 --> 37:28.537
Us?

37:28.605 --> 37:30.539
Or me?

37:34.461 --> 37:36.612
I'll see myself out.

37:56.099 --> 37:58.901
Oh, sorry there.

38:00.303 --> 38:04.139
It's a gift from Fletcher.

38:04.191 --> 38:05.474
A grateful soccer mum.

38:05.525 --> 38:07.827
Is there anything
you want to talk to me about?

38:07.911 --> 38:12.164
What, you mean like--
about my dead mother?

38:12.249 --> 38:13.666
If you like.

38:13.750 --> 38:15.001
No, I just--
I come in here,

38:15.085 --> 38:17.870
I was looking
for someone to play with.

38:22.092 --> 38:24.677
Are you sure there's
nothing you want to say to me?

38:24.761 --> 38:26.846
Look, Anna...

38:26.930 --> 38:29.015
No, we can talk about it
anytime, really.

38:29.099 --> 38:30.683
Anytime you want,
you know?

38:30.767 --> 38:32.268
How about now? You good?

38:32.335 --> 38:34.169
Now? Talk about it
right now if you want.

38:34.221 --> 38:35.638
Come here, ball.

38:47.117 --> 38:49.869
Lightman said you were a big help
reading the crowd the other day.

38:49.953 --> 38:51.370
Big help?

38:51.455 --> 38:52.905
He actually said that?

38:52.990 --> 38:55.290
Look, he wants you
out of the lab

38:55.342 --> 38:57.960
and onto the street, Eli.
That's why he cleaned your desk off.

38:58.028 --> 39:00.479
To do what? He hasn't
told me anything.

39:01.598 --> 39:03.983
Make it up.
Do what he does.

39:04.067 --> 39:07.970
I already applied for a job,
at the Pentagon.

39:08.021 --> 39:09.939
Pentagon?

39:09.990 --> 39:12.858
Lightman's former employer?

39:12.943 --> 39:14.577
Yeah.

39:17.313 --> 39:19.615
You're really gonna do this.

39:19.683 --> 39:23.119
If I get the gig,
I'm history.

39:23.954 --> 39:26.872
Yeah. Big help.

39:26.957 --> 39:29.709
He actually used those words.

39:34.548 --> 39:36.182
Oi, hey.

39:36.266 --> 39:38.601
Hey.

39:38.668 --> 39:40.269
I'm warming up dinner.

39:41.138 --> 39:42.772
Oh.

39:47.144 --> 39:48.227
Whose cat?

39:48.311 --> 39:50.129
What's wrong?

39:50.197 --> 39:52.481
It was a joke...

39:52.532 --> 39:54.567
Love.

39:54.651 --> 39:56.869
When people tell a joke,

39:56.953 --> 39:59.739
all right,
it's polite to laugh.

39:59.823 --> 40:02.141
Did you have
a bad day?

40:08.915 --> 40:12.334
I spoke ill of your
grandmother today.

40:12.386 --> 40:15.037
Really?

40:15.088 --> 40:17.573
Yep.

40:20.060 --> 40:22.678
I've never done that before.

40:22.746 --> 40:25.765
Well, I mean,
I wouldn't forgive you

40:25.849 --> 40:29.752
if you killed
yourself, either.

40:31.605 --> 40:34.657
It wasn't her fault,
you know.

40:34.724 --> 40:38.294
I mean, she was...

40:38.361 --> 40:41.781
She was an ill woman,
you know, she was...

40:41.865 --> 40:43.182
You know...

40:43.250 --> 40:44.500
Out to lunch.

40:44.567 --> 40:47.453
Ooh. So...

40:47.537 --> 40:49.672
Not her fault.

40:58.048 --> 40:59.849
Look at those fingers go,

40:59.916 --> 41:02.184
like little hummingbirds...

41:02.252 --> 41:03.686
They are.

41:04.938 --> 41:06.922
What's that, then?

41:06.973 --> 41:10.259
It's, um, a forward
to your book.

41:10.310 --> 41:11.811
Really?

41:11.895 --> 41:13.696
Yeah. You want to hear
the first part?

41:13.763 --> 41:15.448
Yeah, go ahead.

41:15.532 --> 41:18.433
Uh, "it's not easy
growing up in a hoe

41:18.485 --> 41:21.103
"where someone knows
your every thought.

41:21.154 --> 41:23.923
Or thinks they do."

41:23.990 --> 41:26.659
A lot of pressure, then?

41:27.828 --> 41:28.878
Eh?

41:28.945 --> 41:30.746
You don't have to use it.

41:30.797 --> 41:32.414
It's lovely.

41:32.466 --> 41:34.834
Then why do you look like
you're about to throw up?

41:34.918 --> 41:38.954
Well, 'cause now I got a forward and,
you know, no book.

41:39.005 --> 41:40.289
Meow?

41:40.340 --> 41:42.091
Yes, please.
