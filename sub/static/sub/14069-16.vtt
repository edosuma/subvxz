08:42.782 --> 08:44.326
Well, then we might as well
give up right now,

is as clean as they come.

I'd like to point out

12:59.523 --> 13:01.667
these interviews are normally
for us to quickly approve

13:01.691 --> 13:03.158

is no standard applicant.

for as long as it takes

13:07.864 --> 13:10.565
before ruling
on his application.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.667
Now...
Mr. Chairman, if I may.

13:12.702 --> 13:15.537

Mr. Ross pled guilty

13:15.572 --> 13:17.672

13:17.707 --> 13:20.642
Therefore, I propose we reject
his application right now

13:20.677 --> 13:22.310

35:02.651 --> 35:06.286
Mr. Ross.
Did anyone else know?

35:09.458 --> 35:10.524
I knew.

35:12.961 --> 35:14.661
And if you're looking
for a scalp,

35:14.696 --> 35:16.263
you can have mine.

35:16.298 --> 35:19.232
But I was under the impression
that this hearing

35:19.268 --> 35:21.301
was not about my old firm,
but whether or not

35:21.336 --> 35:24.805
Mr. Ross should be a lawyer.

35:24.840 --> 35:26.406
I say he should.

35:26.442 --> 35:27.908
It doesn't matter
what you say.

35:27.943 --> 35:29.843
He's already had someone
testify for him.

35:29.878 --> 35:31.611
I'm not here to talk
about him.

35:31.647 --> 35:33.447
I'm here to talk
about someone else.

35:33.482 --> 35:34.692
Someone else
has nothing to do with this--

35:34.716 --> 35:36.149
I'd like to hear this.

35:36.185 --> 35:38.952
15 years ago,
a young woman was arrested

35:38.987 --> 35:42.355
for illegally obtaining
prescription drugs.

35:42.391 --> 35:44.524
Turns out she had chronic pain

35:44.560 --> 35:46.293
and didn't want
to drop out of med school,

35:46.328 --> 35:48.061
possibly never to return.

35:48.097 --> 35:51.131
So she stole
a couple of prescription pads

35:51.166 --> 35:53.133
from the hospital
where she was interning--

35:53.168 --> 35:56.536
a crime with a mandatory
sentence of seven years.

35:56.572 --> 36:00.107
But instead of throwing the book
at her,

36:00.142 --> 36:02.576
the prosecuting attorney
showed mercy,

36:02.611 --> 36:05.645
had the charges knocked down
to a misdemeanor,

36:05.681 --> 36:08.748
recommended probation,
and sealed the records.

36:08.784 --> 36:11.284
That's a touching story,
but I don't see

36:11.320 --> 36:13.498
what a random attorney has to do
with these proceedings.

36:13.522 --> 36:15.489
She's not talking
about a random attorney.

36:15.524 --> 36:17.924
She's talking about me.

36:17.960 --> 36:20.727
But just because
I showed compassion once

36:20.762 --> 36:22.729
doesn't mean he deserves it now.

36:22.764 --> 36:24.331
Maybe he doesn't.

36:24.366 --> 36:26.500
But that young woman
is now an ER doctor.

36:26.535 --> 36:28.435
She saves lives.

36:28.470 --> 36:32.939
