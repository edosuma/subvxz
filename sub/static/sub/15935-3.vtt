00:12.671 --> 00:14.438
Previously on Masters of Sex.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.440
I've done other things
for the good of the study

00:16.475 --> 00:18.208
because I believe in it.

00:18.243 --> 00:22.612
At the end of the day,
the work is what endures.

00:22.648 --> 00:24.614
Virginia, I'm... I'm sorry,

00:24.650 --> 00:26.550
but I needed you to see for yourself.

00:26.585 --> 00:27.695
That he has a wife?

00:27.719 --> 00:29.107
You think I didn't know that?

00:29.265 --> 00:31.025
Do most people assume you're married?

00:31.111 --> 00:32.046
You seem married.

00:32.049 --> 00:34.135
- Don't they seem married?
- They're not married.

00:34.159 --> 00:37.627
The charges are pandering
and promoting prostitution.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.700
I can handle the details
of the pending court case,

00:39.703 --> 00:40.597
hire an attorney.

00:40.632 --> 00:42.299
Good, since I was the one that argued

00:42.334 --> 00:44.601
against the surrogacy program
in the first place.

00:44.636 --> 00:46.369
I'm going to AA meetings now.

00:46.405 --> 00:48.738
Did I tell you that?
It's court-ordered.

00:48.774 --> 00:50.574
What are you doing here
if we're not speaking?

00:50.609 --> 00:51.953
I'm here to see my lawyer.

00:51.977 --> 00:53.610
I came to drop off the retainer forms.

00:53.645 --> 00:56.246
I thought our next appointment
wasn't until Tuesday.

00:56.281 --> 00:57.747
I am here for a job.

00:57.783 --> 01:00.951
For 12 years, I've tried every way...

01:00.986 --> 01:03.053
Every misguided way to win your heart

01:03.088 --> 01:05.322
only to realize you
wanted somebody else.

01:05.357 --> 01:07.557
You should know that Dan
called me last week.

01:07.593 --> 01:09.960
I would appreciate it if
we could keep this between us.

01:09.995 --> 01:11.394
That you never got married?

01:11.430 --> 01:14.564
For now, because it's
important for my work.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.167
Bill and I are pursuing
the work separately now.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.902
I will only become a major investor

01:18.937 --> 01:20.363
if you stay together.

01:20.487 --> 01:22.150
We would have to hire new people.

01:22.174 --> 01:23.387
New partners.

01:23.540 --> 01:26.776
We will have to keep
a close eye on them.

02:21.366 --> 02:22.999
Welcome to the party.

02:23.035 --> 02:24.301
Glad you could make it.

02:24.336 --> 02:25.735
What do you say we grab a cocktail

02:25.771 --> 02:30.073
and head to the rumpus room?

02:30.108 --> 02:31.808
We have two guests with us tonight

02:31.843 --> 02:34.878
who might just be the perfect
fit for Playboy.

02:34.913 --> 02:37.380
I'm talking about preeminent sex experts

02:37.416 --> 02:40.550
and authors of the best-selling
Human Sexual Response,

02:40.586 --> 02:43.219
Dr. William Masters
and Virginia Johnson.

02:43.255 --> 02:44.521
We're thrilled to be here, Hef.

02:44.556 --> 02:46.089
Thrilled.

02:46.124 --> 02:48.658
Don't let their
elegant exteriors fool you.

02:48.694 --> 02:51.728
These two are at the forefront
of the sexual revolution.

02:51.763 --> 02:54.731
You might say they are
the sexual revolution.

02:54.766 --> 02:57.167
In fact, you could look
around this living room

02:57.202 --> 03:01.705
and say these two are responsible
for all this.

03:01.740 --> 03:04.274
Is it true you used volunteers
for your research?

03:04.309 --> 03:07.277
Our volunteers were the
cornerstone of our work.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.446
These people, from all walks of life,

03:09.481 --> 03:13.350
were exceedingly generous
and, I might add, very brave.

03:13.385 --> 03:15.018
We've observed and recorded the data

03:15.053 --> 03:18.254
from, uh, over 2,000 participants.

03:18.290 --> 03:20.023
Even I haven't seen that much sex.

03:21.293 --> 03:23.193
Did you all get married before or after

03:23.228 --> 03:25.128
you started watching people have sex?

03:25.163 --> 03:26.730
- Oh, I...
- Oh, no.

03:26.765 --> 03:28.798
We're... we're not... We're not mar...

03:28.834 --> 03:31.434
I'm... I'm married, but to someone else.

03:31.470 --> 03:34.270
Although, uh, I suppose
you could call Dr. Masters

03:34.306 --> 03:36.106
my work husband.

03:36.141 --> 03:38.208
And would you call her your work wife

03:38.276 --> 03:40.810
or is there a real Mrs. Masters?

03:40.846 --> 03:41.945
Uh, there is.

03:41.980 --> 03:43.546
Uh, well, there was.

03:43.582 --> 03:45.582
Well, she's not dead.

03:45.617 --> 03:46.916
I... we had...

03:46.952 --> 03:47.917
You have to admit.

03:47.953 --> 03:49.452
It would make a great story.

03:49.488 --> 03:52.555
Two sex researchers
whose research was so good

03:52.591 --> 03:54.424
it led them straight to the altar.

03:55.694 --> 03:59.429
Sex and love, a mysterious thing.

03:59.464 --> 04:00.341
Hugh, you can say that again, brother.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.798
Oh!

04:01.833 --> 04:03.733
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Sammy Davis Jr.

04:05.971 --> 04:07.103
Hello, Madam Sex Researcher.

04:08.674 --> 04:10.173
How about a song, Sammy?

04:10.208 --> 04:11.007
How about a drink?

04:11.043 --> 04:12.842
You got it.

04:16.380 --> 04:18.882
I'm more of a love researcher myself.

04:21.119 --> 04:24.988
What kind of fool am I

04:26.491 --> 04:29.693
Who never fell in love

04:29.728 --> 04:31.327
Hold on, hold on.

04:31.363 --> 04:32.295
Wrong key.

04:32.330 --> 04:33.463
We'll get it right.

04:33.498 --> 04:34.297
That's a cut.

04:36.034 --> 04:37.801
Okay, background, five minutes.

04:37.836 --> 04:40.670
Crew, that's a reset. New setup.

04:40.706 --> 04:42.439
Sounded terrific, Sammy.

04:42.474 --> 04:43.840
One more time, okay?

04:43.875 --> 04:44.952
The canary tuned me.

04:44.976 --> 04:46.209
Ah, I can see why.

04:47.579 --> 04:48.956
Figure out what key it's in, okay?

04:48.980 --> 04:50.146
Actually, uh, not so fast.

04:50.182 --> 04:52.449
We need some publicity stills.

04:52.484 --> 04:56.119
Maybe, uh, we could get
the two of you dancing.

05:13.839 --> 05:16.206
I don't understand
why Hef keeps promoting us

05:16.241 --> 05:18.074
this way, as a couple.

05:18.110 --> 05:23.079
Whatever the reason, he needs to stop.

05:23.115 --> 05:24.681
It's a marketable concept.

05:24.716 --> 05:25.815
I can see that.

05:25.851 --> 05:27.751
I assume he thinks it's sexy.

05:27.786 --> 05:30.153
But it sends the wrong message.

05:30.188 --> 05:33.389
It's borderline unprofessional.

05:33.425 --> 05:35.725
I'm sure it requires
some explanation from you

05:35.761 --> 05:38.595
when you get home.

05:38.630 --> 05:41.798
Dan can't enjoy this kind of publicity.

05:43.635 --> 05:46.703
He understands it's part of the job.

05:46.738 --> 05:49.405
He's good like that.

05:49.441 --> 05:51.941
Mrs. Johnson and I are done.

06:05.557 --> 06:07.791
Hello, Dan.

06:07.826 --> 06:09.559
Hello?

06:09.594 --> 06:11.728
Oh, I see... I see you have one of those

06:11.763 --> 06:14.631
new phone answering machines.

06:14.666 --> 06:17.934
Uh, anyway, it's me.

06:20.105 --> 06:23.306
You'll never guess who
kissed my hand tonight.

06:23.341 --> 06:26.776
Mr. Show Business himself,
Sammy Davis Jr.

06:26.812 --> 06:29.412
It was really quite something,

06:29.447 --> 06:31.047
although that's not the reason

06:31.082 --> 06:33.316
why I'm calling, obviously.

06:34.352 --> 06:35.652
Uh, I'm calling because...

06:35.687 --> 06:37.220
I had a thought which is

06:37.255 --> 06:40.824
that it's an early start tomorrow.

06:40.859 --> 06:44.060
First thing up is our intake
with the new couple.

06:44.095 --> 06:47.497
The, uh, the Buckseys,
but even before that

06:47.532 --> 06:49.566
we have a meeting with our attorney

06:49.601 --> 06:54.103
um, in the... well,
in our pandering case.

06:54.139 --> 06:58.308
I say we meaning Mrs. Johnson
and myself, but, well,

06:58.343 --> 06:59.809
I'd like you to be there as well.

06:59.845 --> 07:00.951
Of course, Dr. Masters.

07:01.107 --> 07:02.156
If you want me there, I'm there.

07:02.180 --> 07:03.947
I do.

07:03.982 --> 07:06.015
And going forward, if I'm
attending a meeting,

07:06.051 --> 07:08.017
then you will attend as well.

07:08.053 --> 07:12.088
We will work on every aspect of
the clinic's business together,

07:12.123 --> 07:14.757
so I'll need you available at all hours,

07:14.793 --> 07:16.659
which means morning, noon...

07:16.695 --> 07:18.928
Should I come over now?

07:18.964 --> 07:21.297
Now?

07:21.333 --> 07:23.366
It's ten thirty at night.

07:23.401 --> 07:26.202
You're probably wondering
why not speak to a girlfriend

07:26.238 --> 07:28.972
or an analyst,

07:29.007 --> 07:31.107
instead of burdening your home phone

07:31.142 --> 07:33.376
answering machine.

07:33.411 --> 07:37.146
Um, but I... I recently came

07:37.182 --> 07:39.616
across a fascinating study

07:39.651 --> 07:42.018
in the American Medical Journal

07:42.053 --> 07:45.154
about the neuropsychology

07:45.190 --> 07:47.357
of remorse,

07:47.392 --> 07:48.858
and it turns out

07:48.894 --> 07:50.660
that, uh...

07:50.695 --> 07:53.730
that upwards of 75% of people

07:53.765 --> 07:56.499
come to regret
spur-of-the-moment decisions

07:56.534 --> 07:59.069
within a four-week period.

07:59.211 --> 08:01.170
So there will be after-hours dinners

08:01.206 --> 08:03.840
and symposia, cocktail parties,

08:03.875 --> 08:06.042
where I'll also need you by my side.

08:06.077 --> 08:09.012
I am more than
happy to... To be your date.

08:09.047 --> 08:12.382
Date... no, no, I don't...
I don't want a date.

08:12.417 --> 08:16.185
I know that I caused enormous pain.

08:19.624 --> 08:22.025
And I... I deeply regret that.

08:22.060 --> 08:24.193
I need you there because
Virginia will be there

08:24.229 --> 08:26.429
with her husband at those functions

08:26.464 --> 08:30.033
and, well,

08:30.068 --> 08:32.902
there's no pleasure in being
a third wheel now, is there?

08:32.938 --> 08:34.570
So what I...

08:34.606 --> 08:36.673
most want to say is...

08:39.910 --> 08:42.879
Is that I'm sorry.

08:42.914 --> 08:44.914
So I'm glad we got this settled.

08:44.950 --> 08:46.883
I'll see you tomorrow.

09:01.066 --> 09:04.267
What was that? Him making a pass at you?

09:04.302 --> 09:05.935
It's hard to say.

09:05.971 --> 09:08.905
He's either really lonely,
really demanding...

09:08.940 --> 09:11.274
Or really attracted to you

09:11.309 --> 09:13.409
because you're beautiful and sexy.

09:15.847 --> 09:19.115
Maybe the best approach is
a mild, harmless flirtation.

09:19.150 --> 09:21.451
A fizziness that doesn't shut him down

09:21.486 --> 09:25.054
but doesn't exactly
encourage him, either.

09:25.090 --> 09:26.400
Well, however you decide to handle it

09:26.424 --> 09:29.258
we do need to tell him about us, hon.

09:29.294 --> 09:30.927
Sooner than later.

09:30.962 --> 09:32.228
Before all this blows up.

09:32.263 --> 09:33.162
And we will.

09:33.198 --> 09:34.998
We will tell them.

09:35.033 --> 09:37.166
Just let me become indispensable first.

09:41.051 --> 09:43.084
Uh, two coffees to go, please.

09:43.108 --> 09:45.208
You betcha.

09:49.814 --> 09:51.614
You look gorgeous.

09:51.649 --> 09:53.316
Let me guess, it's your first day,

09:53.351 --> 09:56.019
something in the medical profession.

09:57.455 --> 09:58.621
A law firm.

09:58.656 --> 09:59.989
What a happy coincidence.

10:00.025 --> 10:01.324
I'm an attorney myself.

10:01.359 --> 10:02.658
Bram Keller.

10:02.694 --> 10:05.028
What kind of law are you practicing?

10:05.063 --> 10:07.363
Uh, assisting for a divorce attorney.

10:07.399 --> 10:09.165
Ah, divorce.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.300
Well, I'm sure you know
the four magic words, right?

10:11.336 --> 10:13.202
Four words every
divorce lawyer loves to hear,

10:13.238 --> 10:16.439
words that guarantee a big settlement.

10:16.474 --> 10:18.875
And they are in no particular order,

10:18.910 --> 10:21.711
indignities, cruelties, desertion,

10:21.746 --> 10:25.448
and everyone's favorite, infidelity.

10:25.483 --> 10:27.717
I do remember those.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.119
If you get into any trouble, call me.

10:30.155 --> 10:32.655
Or...

10:32.690 --> 10:35.158
if you want to get into trouble,

10:35.193 --> 10:37.894
I'm at the Plaza Hotel.

10:40.532 --> 10:43.833
I admit, it's a very swanky camera.

10:43.868 --> 10:45.401
Nikon F.

10:45.437 --> 10:48.304
The same one David Hemmings
uses in Blowup.

10:48.339 --> 10:49.138
That's a movie.

10:49.174 --> 10:50.907
I like TV.

10:50.942 --> 10:52.508
Anyway, um, I've been moonlighting

10:52.544 --> 10:53.876
for a private investigator,

10:53.912 --> 10:55.878
and since you're an expert
in these things,

10:55.914 --> 10:58.581
I was wondering what constitutes
incriminating evidence,

10:58.616 --> 11:00.183
photo-wise.

11:00.218 --> 11:01.651
To prove someone's been cheating?

11:01.686 --> 11:03.186
Yeah.

11:03.221 --> 11:04.432
Didn't the guy you're moonlighting for

11:04.456 --> 11:06.255
give you any tips?

11:06.324 --> 11:07.990
Uh...

11:08.026 --> 11:09.859
You're spying on your own wife.

11:09.894 --> 11:11.928
- No, that's not...
- Sorry to hear it.

11:11.963 --> 11:12.875
Here's my card.

11:13.033 --> 11:15.076
I don't know for sure
that Jane's been cheating.

11:15.100 --> 11:17.433
You need four clear frames
to use it in court.

11:17.469 --> 11:20.503
Mr. Spleeb. Hello, Lester.

11:20.538 --> 11:22.605
Hello, Mrs. Masters... or...

11:22.640 --> 11:25.374
You're not Mrs. Masters anymore.

11:25.410 --> 11:28.544
It's okay, Lester.

11:28.580 --> 11:31.681
Oh, thanks, but I never touch the stuff.

11:31.716 --> 11:33.783
Agitates my angina.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.017
Ah.

11:35.053 --> 11:37.954
Well, just answer the phones,

11:37.989 --> 11:40.022
keep my Cheez-Its bowl full,

11:40.058 --> 11:41.290
and make sure no one

11:41.326 --> 11:44.961
kills each other in the waiting room.

11:44.996 --> 11:46.062
I kid.

11:46.097 --> 11:47.263
By the time they're here,

11:47.298 --> 11:50.066
they're usually past murderous rage.

11:59.511 --> 12:01.477
With Mr. Keller's hourly rate,

12:01.513 --> 12:03.113
why can't he afford
his own office space?

12:03.148 --> 12:05.047
Well, I suggested it was
more convenient for him

12:05.083 --> 12:06.315
to work with us here.

12:06.351 --> 12:07.150
How cozy.

12:07.185 --> 12:08.985
It's practical.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.720
Good morning.

12:10.755 --> 12:11.921
Hello, Nancy.

12:11.956 --> 12:13.589
Luckily you get to skip this one.

12:13.625 --> 12:14.891
It's a legal meeting.

12:14.926 --> 12:16.631
I asked Dr. Leveau to join.

12:16.769 --> 12:18.139
As our new partner, there's no reason

12:18.163 --> 12:19.629
why she shouldn't be involved

12:19.664 --> 12:21.664
in all aspects of the clinic's business.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.132
Well, if you follow that logic,

12:23.168 --> 12:26.235
then our new partner Dr.
Dreessen should also join.

12:26.271 --> 12:28.104
And while we're at it, why not Hank,

12:28.139 --> 12:30.006
the security guard downstairs?

12:30.041 --> 12:31.285
Well, if you think Hank
would be helpful,

12:31.309 --> 12:34.977
then by all means, invite him in.

12:35.013 --> 12:37.446
Thank you.

12:37.482 --> 12:38.714
After you.

12:38.750 --> 12:40.092
As a strategy,

12:40.237 --> 12:42.163
I think we'd do best to look
back to the Scopes trial.

12:42.187 --> 12:44.020
That was a case in Tennessee where...

12:44.055 --> 12:45.521
A schoolteacher, John Scopes,

12:45.557 --> 12:47.123
was convicted of teaching evolution.

12:47.158 --> 12:49.292
Holstein, try not to condescend
to the client.

12:49.327 --> 12:52.161
Uh, your case, like Scopes,

12:52.197 --> 12:54.463
represents another instance
of science running up

12:54.499 --> 12:57.500
against deeply-held cultural
and religious prejudice.

12:57.535 --> 12:59.446
The Scopes people didn't like
being told that Adam and Eve

12:59.470 --> 13:01.704
were descended from monkeys.

13:01.739 --> 13:02.883
In our case, people don't like

13:02.907 --> 13:04.640
being told that Adam and Eve had sex.

13:04.676 --> 13:06.375
Dysfunctional sex, at that.

13:06.411 --> 13:08.544
The question that matters here

13:08.580 --> 13:10.613
is what are our chances of winning?

13:10.648 --> 13:12.481
Acquittal is one goal but winning

13:12.517 --> 13:14.317
in the court of public opinion...

13:14.352 --> 13:15.325
It's even more crucial.

13:15.326 --> 13:16.664
I mean, this case could tell the world

13:16.688 --> 13:18.688
about the work that we do.

13:18.723 --> 13:21.190
Our book has sold
nearly a million copies.

13:21.226 --> 13:22.625
The world is already well aware

13:22.660 --> 13:25.962
of the work that Dr. Masters and I do.

13:25.997 --> 13:27.964
So, I would say

13:27.999 --> 13:29.732
that acquittal is not one goal.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.467
It's our only goal.

13:31.502 --> 13:33.202
Someone ordered black, two sugars?

13:33.238 --> 13:34.048
Yes, thank you, Miss.

13:34.072 --> 13:36.205
Mm-hmm.

13:36.241 --> 13:37.306
Holy Mary.

13:37.342 --> 13:39.208
What?

13:39.244 --> 13:41.377
Now you want some coffee too?

13:41.412 --> 13:42.211
Me?

13:42.247 --> 13:43.646
No, the other guy

13:43.681 --> 13:47.216
who's staring at me
like I got three heads.

13:47.252 --> 13:48.718
Um...

13:48.753 --> 13:50.987
Okay.

13:51.022 --> 13:53.689
Keep up the good work.

13:53.725 --> 13:55.825
I assume the prosecution will be looking

13:55.860 --> 13:58.160
for any damning evidence.

13:58.196 --> 14:00.274
They will, so we'll need access
to all your case work,

14:00.298 --> 14:01.998
case studies, research data,

14:02.033 --> 14:03.266
financial information.

14:03.301 --> 14:04.650
Mrs. Johnson, if you could gather

14:04.651 --> 14:06.380
all the necessary files
and organize them...

14:06.404 --> 14:10.106
Actually, my name is on the
door as partner, Mr. Keller,

14:10.141 --> 14:11.407
not secretary.

14:11.442 --> 14:13.342
And seeing as I had nothing to do

14:13.378 --> 14:16.012
with the genesis of this mess,

14:16.047 --> 14:17.713
I know that you'll excuse me.

14:17.749 --> 14:19.548
I have a business to run.

14:19.584 --> 14:22.251
Um, just give me one second.

14:25.657 --> 14:28.557
Um, Virginia.

14:28.593 --> 14:30.693
You're worried about
the files, but don't.

14:30.728 --> 14:33.629
I've already destroyed them.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.931
You've destroyed our...
Our personal files.

14:35.967 --> 14:38.367
Our personal experimentation
with protocols,

14:38.403 --> 14:40.036
our sessions together,

14:40.071 --> 14:43.105
I disposed of all of it
before I left for Las Vegas.

14:43.141 --> 14:45.441
Any trace of our work together
is now permanently gone.

14:51.983 --> 14:54.083
Good.

14:59.257 --> 15:01.624
I'm so sorry I'm late.

15:01.659 --> 15:03.259
Stuck in a meeting.

15:03.294 --> 15:06.729
One that will include you
next time, Dr. Dreessen.

15:06.764 --> 15:09.231
So, w can we help you?

15:09.267 --> 15:10.833
I was just explaining to Miss Jackson

15:10.868 --> 15:13.269
that we might not be able to assist her.

15:13.304 --> 15:14.804
Oh, why is that?

15:14.839 --> 15:16.739
See, I read your book, Dr. Johnson,

15:16.774 --> 15:20.843
and I was hoping that you'd
teach me how to be...

15:23.047 --> 15:24.980
Multiple orgasming?

15:25.016 --> 15:26.315
Multi-orgasmic.

15:26.351 --> 15:28.617
Well, you are not the first to ask.

15:28.653 --> 15:33.022
Because in your book it says
some women can have five, six,

15:33.057 --> 15:35.324
even ten orgasms, all in a row.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.026
I mean,

15:37.061 --> 15:38.527
who wouldn't want to learn that?

15:38.563 --> 15:39.873
And I was saying the work we do here

15:39.897 --> 15:41.831
is helping with sexual dysfunctions.

15:41.866 --> 15:44.767
We don't offer how-to courses.

15:44.802 --> 15:47.136
Unfortunately, that is true.

15:47.171 --> 15:48.337
Which is really too bad

15:48.373 --> 15:51.640
because I was gonna be the guinea pig,

15:51.676 --> 15:54.110
and if it worked for me,

15:54.145 --> 15:56.979
all my girlfriends
were going to sign up.

16:00.318 --> 16:01.617
But treat her for what?

16:01.652 --> 16:02.830
There's nothing wrong with her.

16:02.854 --> 16:04.286
Well, technically that's true,

16:04.322 --> 16:07.790
and yet there she is,
asking for our help anyway.

16:07.825 --> 16:10.326
Okay, clearly you have an idea.

16:10.361 --> 16:12.395
Well, our clinic is designed
to treat dysfunction

16:12.430 --> 16:14.641
and of course that must remain
at the center of our work.

16:14.665 --> 16:16.465
But...

16:16.501 --> 16:19.402
You're wondering if there's room
for people like Miss Jackson

16:19.437 --> 16:21.670
who simply want to have better sex.

16:21.706 --> 16:24.507
You're a quick study, Dr. Dreessen.

16:24.542 --> 16:26.475
It's an interesting idea.

16:26.511 --> 16:28.144
Expand the work beyond dysfunction.

16:28.179 --> 16:30.023
Well, for example,
people exercise a healthy heart

16:30.047 --> 16:31.414
to make it stronger.

16:31.449 --> 16:33.082
Right, so why shouldn't the sex life

16:33.117 --> 16:35.157
get the same opportunity
for growth and exploration?

16:35.186 --> 16:37.653
Not to mention, we grow
the work this way,

16:37.688 --> 16:39.054
we're sitting on a gold mine.

16:39.090 --> 16:41.157
A quick study and a breath of fresh air.

16:46.097 --> 16:47.530
Oh! Hey.

16:47.565 --> 16:48.831
I got it.

16:48.866 --> 16:49.698
I got it. It's okay.

16:49.734 --> 16:50.533
Thank you.

16:50.568 --> 16:52.668
Sure.

16:52.703 --> 16:53.702
Sure.

16:58.409 --> 17:01.444
I'm sorry, uh, forgive me for asking.

17:01.479 --> 17:05.047
Do you really not recognize me?

17:05.082 --> 17:07.348
You, uh, I'm sorry.

17:07.385 --> 17:08.217
I really don't.

17:08.252 --> 17:11.186
Uh, we met a long time ago

17:11.255 --> 17:13.789
at that place you worked.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.695
Nope, doesn't ring a bell.

17:20.731 --> 17:23.265
I don't... I don't blame
you for forgetting.

17:23.300 --> 17:25.601
I... I was a wreck.

17:25.636 --> 17:26.769
I was shaking so much

17:26.804 --> 17:29.038
you thought I was having a seizure

17:29.073 --> 17:31.440
and then, um, it's all
coming back to me.

17:31.476 --> 17:34.610
Now, uh, you put your hand
on my arm to calm me

17:34.645 --> 17:37.813
and that's when I...

17:37.849 --> 17:40.616
finished.

17:40.651 --> 17:42.618
Can you grab that box?

17:42.653 --> 17:44.620
Yeah.

17:47.592 --> 17:51.293
I was so embarrassed,
and you were so kind.

17:51.329 --> 17:54.597
You even said that, uh,
I could go another time,

17:54.632 --> 17:58.400
but as soon as you said that, I just...

17:58.436 --> 18:00.569
finished again.

18:00.605 --> 18:02.271
Look,

18:02.306 --> 18:05.941
you are mistaking me for another person.

18:05.977 --> 18:07.476
Understand?

18:10.348 --> 18:11.313
Yes.

18:11.349 --> 18:12.348
Of course.

18:12.383 --> 18:13.582
Um, you're obviously

18:13.618 --> 18:17.419
very accomplished and successful now.

18:17.455 --> 18:19.121
I mean, not that you weren't before.

18:19.156 --> 18:21.490
But... I'm just saying that...

18:21.526 --> 18:24.860
Anyway, I should just shut up.

18:24.896 --> 18:26.328
You should.

18:26.364 --> 18:28.030
Okay.

18:31.536 --> 18:34.036
But if you were talking
to that other person,

18:34.071 --> 18:35.804
which you are not,

18:35.840 --> 18:37.673
I would say to you,

18:37.708 --> 18:40.042
which I am not,

18:40.077 --> 18:42.211
that what happened is very normal

18:42.246 --> 18:44.580
for first-timers.

18:47.385 --> 18:50.886
Uh... I have learned so much since then.

18:50.922 --> 18:55.624
I can do much better now
if you're open to it.

18:55.660 --> 18:56.825
Open to...

18:56.861 --> 18:58.994
Trying again.

18:59.030 --> 19:01.196
You and me.

19:05.236 --> 19:07.002
I can't remember the last time

19:07.038 --> 19:10.339
I, uh, satisfied her,

19:10.374 --> 19:13.075
and I do things, um, bring her flowers,

19:13.110 --> 19:14.476
dim the lights.

19:14.512 --> 19:17.046
All the romantic stuff they say to do.

19:17.081 --> 19:18.414
None of it seems to work.

19:18.449 --> 19:21.483
And have you asked her
what might satisfy her?

19:21.519 --> 19:24.653
"Can I do this? Does that feel good?

19:24.689 --> 19:26.021
Is that too fast?"

19:26.057 --> 19:28.357
He asks my permission for everything.

19:28.392 --> 19:29.592
And you would prefer he...

19:29.627 --> 19:32.695
Take control, say what he wants.

19:32.730 --> 19:34.163
I don't think that's so unusual.

19:34.198 --> 19:35.764
By take control you mean...

19:35.800 --> 19:36.732
Be a gentleman.

19:36.767 --> 19:38.267
That's how I was raised,

19:38.302 --> 19:40.703
and I thought that's
how my wife was raised too.

19:40.738 --> 19:45.374
Mm, being a gentleman
might also mean feeling

19:45.409 --> 19:50.279
uncomfortable about expressing
your needs sexually.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.514
My needs are to make her happy,

19:52.550 --> 19:54.550
treat her with love and respect.

19:54.585 --> 19:58.354
So your sex is tame as a result?

19:58.389 --> 20:00.889
Meaning do you ever envision...

20:00.925 --> 20:03.792
Something like in that movie.

20:03.828 --> 20:05.194
That movie? Which movie?

20:05.229 --> 20:09.098
There's a movie playing
down at the Odeon.

20:09.133 --> 20:10.366
Franny thought that...

20:10.401 --> 20:12.701
I thought it might give Gary some ideas.

20:12.737 --> 20:16.972
So I'm watching this movie,
and I am thinking,

20:17.008 --> 20:19.908
"Jesus, there is something
wrong with my wife."

20:19.944 --> 20:23.112
Then ten minutes into it he stormed out.

20:23.147 --> 20:25.414
Just stood in the lobby
until it was over.

20:25.449 --> 20:27.916
I mean, I love her,
but if you saw that movie,

20:27.952 --> 20:30.786
you'd think the same thing I did.

20:30.821 --> 20:31.987
She needs help.

20:32.023 --> 20:35.624
It's a film called The Defilers.

20:35.660 --> 20:38.560
Yeah, I saw it last week.

20:38.596 --> 20:39.962
On accident.

20:39.997 --> 20:41.964
I thought it was a Western.

20:41.999 --> 20:44.433
You know, The Searchers, The Defilers.

20:44.468 --> 20:47.569
Anyway, turned out to be
your run-of-the-mill roughie.

20:47.605 --> 20:48.604
Roughie?

20:48.639 --> 20:50.005
Most B movies either have

20:50.041 --> 20:52.341
a lot of sex or a lot of violence.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.609
Roughies have both.

20:53.644 --> 20:57.179
Sort of a something-for-everyone combo.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.782
I think we should
see this movie ourselves,

20:59.817 --> 21:02.685
get a better sense of what
it is Mrs. Bucksey has in mind.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.453
You think they have matinees?

21:04.488 --> 21:06.883
Now? On a workday?

21:07.217 --> 21:09.536
And if we're feeling really crazy

21:09.560 --> 21:13.495
we could order popcorn
with extra butter.

21:13.531 --> 21:16.165
Or none of those things.

21:16.200 --> 21:17.866
All right.

21:17.902 --> 21:21.370
Let's get out of the office then.

21:21.405 --> 21:23.472
It could be...

21:23.507 --> 21:24.506
fun.

21:36.353 --> 21:37.953
Hmm.

21:37.988 --> 21:39.688
This feels about as risqué

21:39.724 --> 21:42.825
as Beach Blanket Bingo.

21:45.563 --> 21:46.829
It is hard to imagine

21:46.864 --> 21:49.231
what Mr. Bucksey
would find objectionable.

22:53.731 --> 22:55.364
I could use some air.

23:00.671 --> 23:03.739
It seems there are two
ways in which women have

23:03.774 --> 23:04.973
multiple orgasms.

23:05.009 --> 23:06.375
The first is spontaneous.

23:06.410 --> 23:08.043
We saw this in the lab.

23:08.078 --> 23:09.545
Uh, serial climaxes

23:09.580 --> 23:12.714
in a rolling or wave-like
pattern that you see here.

23:12.750 --> 23:13.760
With no refractory period.

23:13.784 --> 23:14.883
Yes.

23:14.919 --> 23:16.485
The other way, still multiples,

23:16.520 --> 23:20.656
but in these cases the women
apparently have to work at it,

23:20.691 --> 23:22.090
if you will.

23:22.126 --> 23:25.394
They orgasm and then pause
in the plateau phase,

23:25.429 --> 23:27.440
and then after a minute or two
they can stimulate themselves

23:27.464 --> 23:31.133
back to orgasm and then they can
do this over and over again.

23:31.168 --> 23:32.946
That would be the kind
we would have to teach.

23:32.970 --> 23:35.137
Yes, seeing as the spontaneous variety

23:35.172 --> 23:36.772
requires no instruction at all.

23:36.807 --> 23:38.151
But how do we go from all this raw data

23:38.175 --> 23:40.642
to creating an actual protocol?

23:40.678 --> 23:42.177
Is there a specific process

23:42.213 --> 23:44.613
that you and Dr. Masters followed?

23:44.648 --> 23:47.916
For instance, how did you
develop the protocol for impotence?

23:47.952 --> 23:51.320
That one always struck
me as almost visionary.

23:51.355 --> 23:54.489
Oh.

23:54.525 --> 23:58.026
It was hours of recorded data,

23:58.062 --> 24:01.363
going through trying
to find possible patterns

24:01.398 --> 24:02.698
among participants.

24:02.733 --> 24:04.466
Same as all the others.

24:04.501 --> 24:08.103
Why don't I spend some time
with the research this evening,

24:08.138 --> 24:10.472
try to come up with the
potential protocol

24:10.507 --> 24:11.940
for multiple orgasms

24:11.976 --> 24:15.377
and then we can start
with Miss Jackson tomorrow?

24:26.190 --> 24:29.391
We missed something with Mrs. Bucksey.

24:29.426 --> 24:34.229
In her past, perhaps,
a history of violence.

24:34.265 --> 24:36.632
Causes her to pair

24:36.667 --> 24:39.334
sexual pleasure with pain.

24:39.370 --> 24:41.803
Or I am wondering

24:41.839 --> 24:44.206
if maybe Mrs. Bucksey

24:44.241 --> 24:46.041
just needs a little excitement.

24:46.076 --> 24:48.343
I... I dated a guy once

24:48.379 --> 24:50.579
who liked to blindfold me,

24:50.614 --> 24:52.581
tie me to the bed.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.483
Carl somebody. I liked it.

24:54.518 --> 24:57.219
And I don't have any past traumas.

24:57.254 --> 25:00.022
Everyone has traumas.

25:00.057 --> 25:02.057
Some people are just more aware of them.

25:02.092 --> 25:05.327
But aren't pain and
pleasure two sides of the same coin?

25:05.362 --> 25:07.996
Both elicit the same physiological
reactions.

25:08.032 --> 25:09.765
Increased heart rate, perspiration,

25:09.800 --> 25:11.020
shortness of breath.

25:11.023 --> 25:12.946
A well-adjusted individual
knows the difference.

25:12.970 --> 25:14.736
Not always.

25:14.772 --> 25:18.707
It can be oddly romantic, even erotic,

25:18.742 --> 25:22.044
the sensation of pain,

25:22.079 --> 25:24.746
of punishment.

25:24.782 --> 25:27.349
Haven't you ever gone after something

25:27.384 --> 25:28.684
you knew would hurt you

25:28.719 --> 25:31.119
because it also felt good?

25:39.496 --> 25:42.364
And then the last brunette
I went out with, she...

25:42.399 --> 25:44.266
Well, she broke my heart.

25:44.301 --> 25:48.570
Please allow me to apologize
on behalf of all brunettes.

25:48.605 --> 25:50.973
Yeah, well, she was one of those people

25:51.008 --> 25:52.908
who leaves a trail
of wreckage in her wake

25:52.943 --> 25:54.776
and never looks back.

25:54.812 --> 25:56.611
It's why I stay on the road.

25:56.647 --> 26:00.282
Always a new city,
new sights, new faces.

26:00.317 --> 26:02.651
New life insurance policies to sell.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.586
Hey, I don't sell
life insurance policies.

26:04.660 --> 26:05.593
I sell peace of mind.

26:08.592 --> 26:09.825
Hmm.

26:11.795 --> 26:14.763
What do you know about orgasms?

26:18.035 --> 26:19.634
Ha.

26:19.670 --> 26:22.170
I know I like them.

26:22.206 --> 26:26.575
Because I have a proposal for you.

26:26.610 --> 26:29.011
Kind of a challenge.

26:29.046 --> 26:30.612
I'm a researcher.

26:30.647 --> 26:32.848
I'm currently working on
a very interesting project

26:32.883 --> 26:35.183
studying the innate ability

26:35.219 --> 26:39.588
of women to be multi-orgasmic.

26:39.623 --> 26:43.759
So I guess what I'm asking you is...

26:43.794 --> 26:45.794
Yes.

26:45.829 --> 26:46.995
Yes! Yes!

26:49.566 --> 26:50.665
That was really good.

26:50.701 --> 26:51.811
You're doing such a good job.

26:51.835 --> 26:53.201
No, no, no, don't move. Okay.

26:53.237 --> 26:56.638
Plateau achieved
three minutes, 21 seconds.

26:56.673 --> 26:58.840
- Who are you talking to?
- Shh, I need to concentrate.

26:58.876 --> 27:00.476
Actually, can you pass me that pad, Lou?

27:00.511 --> 27:01.543
Lee.

27:01.578 --> 27:03.512
That's what I said. Please.

27:03.547 --> 27:05.614
You know, I'm kind of
losing my hard-on here.

27:05.649 --> 27:10.352
Just keep... keep
touching my breast for six seconds.

27:10.387 --> 27:11.987
And my hard-on is gone.

27:12.022 --> 27:13.989
Really? That's hardly helpful.

27:14.024 --> 27:15.323
No thanks to you.

27:15.359 --> 27:18.660
All vaginal and clitoral
stimulation avoided.

27:18.695 --> 27:20.529
- Could you move over, please?
- What?

27:20.564 --> 27:21.696
Gonna do this on my own.

27:21.732 --> 27:23.231
I need space.

27:23.267 --> 27:24.733
Okay.

27:24.768 --> 27:28.904
Leaving plateau phase in ten, nine,

27:28.939 --> 27:33.175
eight, seven, six...

28:07.978 --> 28:09.678
Keller.

28:09.713 --> 28:11.079
Hi.

28:11.115 --> 28:13.515
Um, this is Libby,

28:13.550 --> 28:15.217
the... the woman you met

28:15.252 --> 28:17.119
earlier today at the diner.

28:17.154 --> 28:18.453
Libby.

28:18.489 --> 28:20.755
I'm, uh, happy you called.

28:20.791 --> 28:22.457
Me too.

28:22.493 --> 28:24.526
I think.

28:24.561 --> 28:25.861
It sounds like you're drinking

28:25.896 --> 28:26.940
but please, don't drink alone.

28:26.964 --> 28:27.762
Come to the hotel.

28:27.798 --> 28:28.730
Meet me for a glass.

28:28.765 --> 28:29.564
What?

28:29.600 --> 28:30.565
No.

28:30.601 --> 28:32.100
Thank you.

28:32.136 --> 28:35.971
Uh, the reason that I'm
calling is, um, because,

28:36.006 --> 28:40.976
well, I'm calling as a political act.

28:41.011 --> 28:42.744
I like the sound of that. Tell me more.

28:42.779 --> 28:45.046
I'm in this consciousness-raising group,

28:45.082 --> 28:48.216
and, um, we decided that for a woman

28:48.252 --> 28:51.620
to call a man she doesn't know
is an act of rebellion.

28:51.655 --> 28:53.221
Against the patriarchy.

28:53.257 --> 28:56.124
Well, bravo, rebellious Libby.

28:57.861 --> 28:59.461
I really never do things like this.

28:59.496 --> 29:00.595
So...

29:00.631 --> 29:02.464
...let's be rebellious together.

29:03.667 --> 29:05.634
I'm not coming to your hotel.

29:05.669 --> 29:06.935
Doesn't mean we can't get

29:06.970 --> 29:08.236
to know each other

29:08.272 --> 29:09.938
over the phone.

29:12.209 --> 29:13.742
What are you wearing?

29:13.777 --> 29:15.510
What?

29:15.546 --> 29:18.346
Go on. Tell me what you're wearing.

29:18.382 --> 29:20.448
I can wait all night, if you want.

29:22.653 --> 29:27.022
I... I'm...

29:27.057 --> 29:28.723
wearing a dress.

29:30.394 --> 29:33.028
Hello again, Dan's phone
answering machine.

29:33.063 --> 29:34.496
It's me.

29:34.531 --> 29:36.631
I'm so sorry for calling so late

29:36.667 --> 29:38.533
but I know that
you're a bit of a night owl

29:38.569 --> 29:41.203
so I thought maybe I'd catch you.

29:41.238 --> 29:42.971
I...

29:43.006 --> 29:44.973
I suppose that...

29:45.008 --> 29:48.877
I still am hoping that you'll call me,

29:48.912 --> 29:51.780
not that you're under
any obligation to, of course,

29:51.815 --> 29:53.682
but I...

29:53.717 --> 29:55.016
I don't know.

29:55.052 --> 29:57.018
I've been having trouble
sleeping lately,

29:57.054 --> 30:01.356
so I suspect that it might
have something to do

30:01.391 --> 30:03.959
with leaving things so...

30:03.994 --> 30:06.962
upended between us,

30:06.997 --> 30:09.331
and I do think that a certain closure

30:09.366 --> 30:13.168
would help both of us to
move on is all I'm saying.

30:14.771 --> 30:18.773
So if you get this, please,
uh, do call me back.

30:20.877 --> 30:22.978
It would be...

30:23.013 --> 30:26.348
nice to hear your voice.

30:37.060 --> 30:39.828
You know, I've been studying
the surrogacy cases.

30:39.863 --> 30:42.731
It's incredible what you
guys were doing here.

30:42.766 --> 30:44.366
Cases that were filmed and cataloged

30:44.401 --> 30:46.401
in a very Robert Flaherty
Nanook of the North

30:46.436 --> 30:49.604
kind of way.

30:49.640 --> 30:51.106
Okay, like this one.

30:51.141 --> 30:54.542
Uh, male, 36, he
had sex once in his life

30:54.578 --> 30:58.413
and it went so badly that he was
considering the priesthood.

30:58.448 --> 31:00.448
And then in the follow-up notes it says

31:00.484 --> 31:03.285
that after his treatment here,
he went out and met someone,

31:03.320 --> 31:06.187
a nice girl, and now they're engaged.

31:06.223 --> 31:10.792
I'm just a sucker for a happy ending.

31:10.827 --> 31:14.262
Were you one of the surrogates?

31:14.298 --> 31:16.298
I'm just saying since... All I'm saying

31:16.333 --> 31:19.401
is that this is God's work.

31:19.436 --> 31:21.703
Noble, like what you
did for me back then.

31:21.738 --> 31:22.637
You're welcome.

31:22.673 --> 31:23.805
Now for the love of God,

31:23.840 --> 31:27.475
stop talking to me about this.

31:43.760 --> 31:45.271
So I went back
through the data last night

31:45.295 --> 31:48.129
and I think what I mentioned is correct.

31:48.165 --> 31:50.310
Some women may have the ability
to have multiple orgasms

31:50.334 --> 31:51.633
from the plateau phase

31:51.668 --> 31:53.234
if they submit to the re-application

31:53.270 --> 31:55.603
of effective stimulation.

31:55.639 --> 31:57.272
Effective stimulation being...

31:57.307 --> 32:00.075
Stimulation of the breasts,
the buttocks, the neck.

32:00.110 --> 32:03.178
Anywhere except the vaginal
or clitoral areas.

32:03.213 --> 32:05.180
Which are too sensitive
following orgasm.

32:05.215 --> 32:06.815
Yes.

32:06.850 --> 32:09.417
So maybe it's a matter of the
couple remaining engaged

32:09.453 --> 32:12.253
but removing focus
from certain hot spots.

32:12.289 --> 32:14.022
I'm not sure that I would use that term,

32:14.057 --> 32:16.791
but I think it might be possible.

32:16.827 --> 32:18.927
And all of that was in the data?

32:18.962 --> 32:22.364
It required some reading
between the lines, but yes.

32:22.399 --> 32:25.533
Well, Miss Jackson is
here but has a problem.

32:25.569 --> 32:26.927
She couldn't find a partner.

32:27.133 --> 32:29.449
Apparently every man she asked
said it was stressful enough

32:29.473 --> 32:32.607
providing one orgasm,
but multiples, forget it,

32:32.642 --> 32:35.276
so we can tell her to come back
as soon as she finds someone.

32:35.312 --> 32:37.045
Or we could bring her in.

32:37.080 --> 32:40.548
A woman doesn't need a partner
to experience pleasure.

32:40.584 --> 32:43.118
We'll start with mapping
your sexual response,

32:43.153 --> 32:45.520
and when we have an idea
of your resolution phase...

32:45.555 --> 32:48.356
That is, the amount of
time it takes to recover

32:48.392 --> 32:49.824
after an orgasm.

32:49.860 --> 32:51.793
And once we determine that,

32:51.828 --> 32:53.628
hopefully we'll be able to guide you

32:53.663 --> 32:55.697
towards achieving multiple climaxes.

32:56.867 --> 33:01.136
This feels sad, doing this alone.

33:01.171 --> 33:02.570
It's not sad at all, Dawn.

33:02.606 --> 33:04.239
Think of yourself as a pioneer.

33:04.274 --> 33:08.076
Like in a bonnet, pulling a
wagon across the dusty plain?

33:08.111 --> 33:10.512
Well, there's a long
tradition of brave women going it alone.

33:12.048 --> 33:13.715
Uh, there's a lady here to see you.

33:13.750 --> 33:15.250
Says she's an old friend.

33:15.285 --> 33:16.985
I'm in the middle of a session, Betty.

33:17.020 --> 33:19.654
She seems insistent.

33:19.689 --> 33:21.756
I will be right back.

33:21.792 --> 33:25.059
Oh, and also I like to make
sure that Ulysses isn't cold

33:25.095 --> 33:26.261
before a session.

33:26.296 --> 33:28.263
A warm towel usually helps.

33:28.298 --> 33:29.664
Okay.

33:29.699 --> 33:34.436
I will warm Ulysses.

33:34.471 --> 33:37.405
I know they know what they're doing.

33:37.441 --> 33:39.741
Just didn't think it
was going to be like this.

33:39.776 --> 33:44.446
I thought I'd be looking
into someone's eyes, you know?

33:44.481 --> 33:46.514
All that pleasure,

33:46.550 --> 33:49.818
both of us feeling so sexy and good.

33:51.688 --> 33:53.555
Maybe I should wait

33:53.590 --> 33:57.025
until I can find an actual...

33:57.060 --> 33:58.560
person.

34:05.235 --> 34:07.569
My receptionist said
you wanted to see me?

34:10.607 --> 34:12.806
Hello, Virginia.

34:12.842 --> 34:15.109
Said it was God's work, remember?

34:15.145 --> 34:18.313
I did, but then you told
me to stop talking.

34:18.348 --> 34:19.481
Because I don't like

34:19.516 --> 34:22.382
to broadcast my previous life, okay?

34:22.418 --> 34:25.954
But I did spend a lot of
years helping out men,

34:25.989 --> 34:28.755
and now...

34:28.792 --> 34:30.925
there is a woman in that room struggling

34:30.960 --> 34:33.928
in the same way you
did when we first met

34:33.964 --> 34:37.632
and this is your chance to, you know,

34:37.667 --> 34:39.167
repay the favor.

34:39.202 --> 34:41.135
Having sex with a stranger?

34:41.170 --> 34:42.637
I was a stranger.

34:42.672 --> 34:44.973
Look, you say you're
such a stallion in the sack,

34:45.007 --> 34:49.077
why don't you go in there and prove it?

34:49.112 --> 34:51.312
I wanted to prove it to you.

34:51.348 --> 34:54.114
And like the Pope going
on a date with Sophia Loren,

34:54.150 --> 34:56.016
that is never gonna happen.

35:00.190 --> 35:03.191
Will you at least watch me?

35:11.635 --> 35:13.468
So this is what a
sex researcher's office

35:13.503 --> 35:16.538
looks like.

35:16.573 --> 35:19.607
I'm not sure what I imagined,
but it wasn't this.

35:19.643 --> 35:21.175
These your children?

35:21.211 --> 35:23.044
Alice, I hope that you're
not here to ask me

35:23.079 --> 35:24.979
to intervene between you and Dan

35:25.015 --> 35:27.348
because that would be
highly inappropriate.

35:27.384 --> 35:29.484
Yes, I'm aware of that.

35:29.519 --> 35:31.352
I'm here because I wanted
you to understand

35:31.388 --> 35:34.789
that I know what you're going through.

35:34.824 --> 35:36.324
I'm not following.

35:36.359 --> 35:40.161
I know you've tried to contact Dan.

35:40.196 --> 35:42.330
Well, I'm not sure who told you that.

35:42.365 --> 35:43.531
No one told me.

35:43.567 --> 35:46.234
I heard your messages on the machine.

35:46.269 --> 35:47.535
Dan and I have reconciled.

35:47.571 --> 35:49.871
I'm back home with him now.

35:55.612 --> 36:00.548
Sorry, you flew all the way
from New York to tell me this?

36:00.584 --> 36:02.550
Dan has a habit of leaving messes behind

36:02.586 --> 36:04.385
as I'm sure you can imagine,

36:04.421 --> 36:07.322
and when he's finished
with his latest distraction,

36:07.357 --> 36:09.524
I'm the one that
comes in and cleans it up.

36:09.559 --> 36:12.226
Make sure there's no
false hopes for reconciliation.

36:12.262 --> 36:16.331
Oh, I think that you might
be confused, Alice.

36:16.366 --> 36:18.146
Have you been drinking?

36:18.403 --> 36:20.947
Well, you can't say I didn't
warn you, Virginia.

36:20.971 --> 36:22.170
He didn't come back to you.

36:22.205 --> 36:23.905
I left him.

36:23.940 --> 36:26.040
The only reason why he's back with you

36:26.076 --> 36:29.744
is because I broke his heart.

36:29.779 --> 36:31.779
Well, everyone has their story.

36:31.815 --> 36:33.615
No, no, no, no, it's not a story.

36:33.650 --> 36:36.250
It's the truth.

36:36.286 --> 36:39.120
We were due at the
wedding chapel at seven o'clock,

36:39.155 --> 36:42.390
and at four that afternoon I
went downstairs to the tables.

36:42.425 --> 36:46.227
I found a nice man
with a Pearl Harbor tattoo,

36:46.262 --> 36:48.029
and I took him upstairs

36:48.064 --> 36:52.600
and let Dan discover us.

36:52.636 --> 36:55.503
That's the real reason
why he's back with you.

36:59.242 --> 37:03.444
I don't know who's more
deserving of pity in that story.

37:03.480 --> 37:06.581
What kind of woman
beds a man on the same day

37:06.616 --> 37:08.116
she was meant to marry another?

37:08.151 --> 37:09.717
Forgive me for cutting this short,

37:09.753 --> 37:12.320
but I have work to do.

37:12.355 --> 37:16.658
I must say, Virginia, I was
so touched by your messages.

37:16.693 --> 37:18.559
I cant count the times I've been drunk,

37:18.595 --> 37:20.495
calling late at night,

37:20.530 --> 37:23.731
searching for the smallest
bit of solace.

37:23.767 --> 37:26.934
If anyone knows the sound
of a lonely woman,

37:26.970 --> 37:30.405
it's me.

37:30.440 --> 37:32.073
But...

37:32.108 --> 37:34.509
I'm sure you'll find someone.

37:37.547 --> 37:40.948
You really are so beautiful.

37:40.984 --> 37:42.483
And from what Dan says,

37:42.519 --> 37:45.953
you've never had a problem
attracting men.

37:59.569 --> 38:01.035
We found a partner.

38:01.071 --> 38:02.970
Betty found him, actually,

38:03.006 --> 38:04.906
and he's a natural.

38:14.184 --> 38:18.119
Not that he can see me,
but you know, good for him.

38:18.154 --> 38:19.620
Can you hear me in there?

38:19.656 --> 38:23.357
If you can just ease up
on the movement for a bit.

38:23.393 --> 38:24.225
That's right.

38:24.260 --> 38:25.660
Now, don't disengage,

38:25.695 --> 38:29.230
but don't stimulate
the vaginal area either.

38:29.265 --> 38:32.400
Try touching her breasts.

38:32.435 --> 38:35.036
Do you want to add anything?

38:35.071 --> 38:38.206
So far two orgasms in eight minutes.

38:38.241 --> 38:39.173
Yes!

38:39.209 --> 38:41.375
Steve! Yes! Oh!

38:41.411 --> 38:42.577
Scotty.

38:42.612 --> 38:43.678
- Oh, sorry.
- It's okay.

38:43.713 --> 38:46.147
Oh, yes, Scotty, oh!

38:46.182 --> 38:48.182
Incredible. That's three in ten.

38:48.218 --> 38:50.651
They just met, so there's
no intimacy or love

38:50.687 --> 38:52.053
or knowing each other's bodies.

38:52.088 --> 38:56.023
It's just a purely
physiological response.

38:56.059 --> 38:57.759
Congratulations, Virginia.

38:57.794 --> 39:00.394
We may be on our way
to a brand new protocol.

39:03.366 --> 39:05.433
When people are attracted to pain...

39:05.468 --> 39:07.435
I'm not attracted to pain.

39:07.470 --> 39:11.506
Well, the movie that
you found stimulating,

39:11.541 --> 39:14.609
Mrs. Bucksey, enacts fantasies
of rape and violence.

39:14.644 --> 39:16.544
She found it as sick as I did.

39:16.579 --> 39:18.246
It was a movie, Gary.

39:18.281 --> 39:19.881
That's all. I was just hoping

39:19.916 --> 39:22.155
to bring some
excitement back into our marriage.

39:22.156 --> 39:23.429
In our discussions yesterday,

39:23.453 --> 39:25.186
you told us you wanted Mr. Bucksey

39:25.221 --> 39:26.587
to take more control.

39:26.623 --> 39:28.356
Yes, that's all I was saying.

39:28.391 --> 39:30.858
I'm not sure that is all.

39:30.894 --> 39:33.027
Is it not also possible

39:33.062 --> 39:34.362
that you want your husband

39:34.397 --> 39:38.065
to... to hurt you?

39:38.101 --> 39:41.469
Just tell the truth, Fran.

39:41.504 --> 39:43.471
And even if you do
want Gary to hurt you,

39:43.506 --> 39:45.406
we are not saying that's wrong.

39:45.441 --> 39:48.709
Although we have found in our research

39:48.745 --> 39:51.712
that patients with your
psychological profile,

39:51.748 --> 39:54.582
they often have episodes
from childhood...

39:54.617 --> 39:56.083
Abuse of some sort,

39:56.119 --> 39:57.621
that they haven't yet resolved.

39:57.793 --> 39:59.720
Abuse?

39:59.756 --> 40:01.155
But...

40:01.191 --> 40:04.959
My father tapped me
on the bottom maybe once

40:04.994 --> 40:07.495
when I was a child, but I wasn't abused.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.008
Mrs. Bucksey, would it be fair

40:09.032 --> 40:12.733
to say that, uh, what
you want is to feel desired?

40:12.769 --> 40:14.235
Yes.

40:14.270 --> 40:16.404
I want to feel...

40:16.439 --> 40:20.107
Like he's hungry for me.

40:20.143 --> 40:22.009
Like those men in the film.

40:22.045 --> 40:25.313
"The desire of the man is for the woman,

40:25.348 --> 40:28.749
but the desire of the woman
is for the desire of the man."

40:28.785 --> 40:29.784
Exactly.

40:29.819 --> 40:30.985
Madame de Stael.

40:31.020 --> 40:32.486
It's a French philosopher.

40:32.522 --> 40:35.022
The point is, women
want to feel desired,

40:35.058 --> 40:36.457
sometimes aggressively so.

40:36.492 --> 40:38.593
Well, I don't want to hurt her.

40:38.628 --> 40:39.660
I can't.

40:39.696 --> 40:41.596
So don't.

40:41.631 --> 40:45.333
But what if it were just a little...

40:45.368 --> 40:47.235
rough?

40:47.270 --> 40:49.656
Could you do that?

40:50.333 --> 40:53.118
If you're willing to try, Mr. Bucksey,

40:53.142 --> 40:57.311
we are here to help.

41:07.223 --> 41:09.023
I like that. It can be harder.

41:09.058 --> 41:11.392
It's what I
intuited about her all along,

41:11.427 --> 41:14.695
that what she's asking for
is not rooted in pathology.

41:17.867 --> 41:19.200
Are you sure you want me to?

41:19.235 --> 41:20.401
Yeah.

41:20.436 --> 41:23.170
You can start softly if you want to.

41:32.081 --> 41:33.881
That wasn't so bad, was it?

41:33.917 --> 41:36.884
She just wants something
that feels a little dangerous.

41:36.920 --> 41:38.920
I understand it.

41:43.593 --> 41:44.659
Like that?

41:44.694 --> 41:46.027
Mm-hmm.

41:46.062 --> 41:48.262
It feels a little gentle.

41:53.069 --> 41:54.435
Better?

41:54.470 --> 41:55.948
You don't have to keep asking, honey.

41:55.972 --> 41:57.705
Just... just do it.

41:59.943 --> 42:02.777
Honestly, I can barely feel you.

42:04.147 --> 42:06.614
If you're gonna hit me, hit me.

42:06.649 --> 42:07.848
- Ouch!
- Like that?

42:07.884 --> 42:08.916
Yes, but maybe not...

42:08.952 --> 42:10.351
Ouch! No, just a little.

42:11.220 --> 42:14.355
Ouch! Ow!

42:14.390 --> 42:15.756
Gary, stop!

42:15.792 --> 42:17.558
What the fuck do you want from me!

42:19.228 --> 42:20.094
Gary!

42:20.129 --> 42:21.429
Mr. Bucksey, Mr. Bucksey!

42:21.464 --> 42:23.798
That is... that is enough!

42:46.422 --> 42:47.621
Virginia?

42:47.657 --> 42:49.557
Yes.

42:49.592 --> 42:52.293
I, um,

42:52.328 --> 42:54.095
I know we said we
were going to keep things

42:54.130 --> 42:58.666
separate between us, but there's a case,

42:58.701 --> 43:02.603
uh, there's a couple...

43:02.638 --> 43:03.504
Um...

43:03.539 --> 43:05.806
Well, I...

43:05.842 --> 43:10.578
I suspected there was
a past history of, um,

43:10.613 --> 43:14.615
trauma of some kind on the wife's part,

43:14.650 --> 43:17.918
but I, uh, I misjudged the situation

43:17.954 --> 43:22.656
and, um, it's the husband.

43:22.692 --> 43:25.593
There's something very...

43:25.628 --> 43:29.630
wrong there.

43:29.665 --> 43:32.400
Possibly, uh, severe childhood abuse.

43:35.705 --> 43:38.439
I see.

43:38.474 --> 43:41.342
That would be a difficult case for you,

43:41.377 --> 43:44.879
treating someone with that history,

43:44.914 --> 43:47.982
especially with a new partner.

43:48.017 --> 43:51.352
So, you want my help?

43:51.387 --> 43:52.720
Although, if you're unable...

43:52.755 --> 43:55.623
No, I'll help.

43:55.658 --> 43:59.527
Of course I'll help.

43:59.562 --> 44:01.128
I appreciate it.

44:19.048 --> 44:20.881
Hello.

44:20.917 --> 44:22.016
Oh, Libby.

44:23.352 --> 44:25.152
Aren't you clever, tracking me down?

44:25.188 --> 44:28.889
More like lucky since I'm
looking for Elizabeth Masters.

44:32.862 --> 44:35.162
E... lizabeth.

44:35.198 --> 44:36.864
Libby.

44:39.402 --> 44:41.168
Oh, sweet Jesus.

44:41.204 --> 44:45.506
Are you blushing?

44:45.541 --> 44:48.742
I am... I'm just trying to
figure out a way to say this.

44:48.778 --> 44:51.779
I am, um, here

44:51.814 --> 44:54.014
to ask you to put your divorce on hold

44:54.050 --> 44:56.617
just until your husband's trial is over.

44:59.622 --> 45:01.956
You're Bill's lawyer?

45:01.991 --> 45:03.457
Isn't that a small world?

45:03.493 --> 45:05.270
I thought Walter was handling
the divorce for Bill.

45:05.294 --> 45:07.795
I'm his criminal attorney,
but just... just so you know,

45:07.830 --> 45:09.797
this doesn't have to change
anything that happened

45:09.832 --> 45:10.731
between us.

45:10.766 --> 45:13.067
Nothing happened between us.

45:13.102 --> 45:14.301
Of course not.

45:14.337 --> 45:17.304
Of course not, but um, there is...

45:17.340 --> 45:22.076
There's one other
small thing while I'm here.

45:22.111 --> 45:24.378
We... meaning the defense team,

45:24.413 --> 45:28.315
were hoping that you would
testify at the trial.

45:28.351 --> 45:30.451
You would make an excellent witness.

45:30.486 --> 45:31.585
A witness to...

45:31.621 --> 45:33.420
Your husband's character.

45:36.359 --> 45:39.093
You, um, you want me to take the stand

45:39.128 --> 45:42.188
and talk about the
kind of man that Bill is?

45:42.189 --> 45:43.342
Well, it's really... It's very simple.

45:43.366 --> 45:44.476
Yeah, should I start with...

45:44.500 --> 45:46.800
What were those four words again?

45:46.836 --> 45:48.335
Oh, right, the indignities

45:48.371 --> 45:50.070
that I suffered while married to Bill?

45:50.106 --> 45:51.305
Well...

45:51.340 --> 45:53.174
Or how about I talk about the desertion?

45:53.209 --> 45:54.275
Is that right?

45:54.310 --> 45:55.743
I know it can be very difficult.

45:55.778 --> 45:57.845
What about mentioning
the cruelties that I endured

45:57.880 --> 46:02.183
during my marriage or I could
skip straight to the infidelity.

46:02.218 --> 46:03.083
I'm gonna go now.

46:03.119 --> 46:04.451
Mm-hmm.

46:04.487 --> 46:06.320
And I'll let you just mull it over.

46:06.355 --> 46:08.656
Yeah, I don't have
to mull a fucking thing,

46:08.691 --> 46:10.457
Mr. Keller.

46:10.493 --> 46:12.393
Apparently not.

46:15.965 --> 46:18.432
May I just say, you
would make an excellent lawyer.

46:18.467 --> 46:20.151
Get out.

46:23.666 --> 46:26.118
My husband left me for another woman,

46:26.142 --> 46:28.709
and the feelings were there

46:28.744 --> 46:31.145
no matter how much I drank.

46:31.180 --> 46:33.881
You know it's bad when you wake up

46:33.916 --> 46:36.951
passed out on a park
bench in Central Park

46:36.986 --> 46:40.154
on a Sunday morning
while people are sitting in it,

46:40.189 --> 46:43.891
or vomiting while you and your
husband walk into the symphony,

46:43.926 --> 46:45.292
even if it is Mahler.

46:47.063 --> 46:49.663
I was so angry.

46:49.699 --> 46:53.067
I probably still am.

46:53.102 --> 46:56.003
But I'm not drinking anymore.

46:56.038 --> 46:58.973
It's been a month now.

47:03.613 --> 47:07.381
Um, but best of all,

47:07.416 --> 47:10.351
my husband's come back.

47:10.386 --> 47:11.819
We're together again,

47:11.854 --> 47:16.690
so that's something to stay sober for.

47:27.203 --> 47:32.039
And so I realized if I didn't
do something drastic,

47:32.074 --> 47:34.074
then in four hours I would

47:34.110 --> 47:38.679
marry a man who didn't know me.

47:38.714 --> 47:41.715
Yeah, who knows anyone?

47:41.751 --> 47:43.350
Who cares?

47:43.386 --> 47:46.453
Well, as it turns out, I care.

47:46.489 --> 47:48.322
Okay.

47:51.260 --> 47:54.528
Since, uh, since
I've seen you leave here

47:54.563 --> 47:58.065
with three
different guys just this week,

47:58.100 --> 48:01.168
I'd like to be number four.

48:13.082 --> 48:15.582
You are Lady Luck.

48:21.991 --> 48:23.624
Art.

48:23.659 --> 48:25.926
What in the world are you doing here?

48:25.961 --> 48:27.406
Um, Betty said I might find you here.

48:27.430 --> 48:28.929
I was looking for you after work.

48:28.964 --> 48:30.776
I... I wanted to maybe
take you out for a drink.

48:30.800 --> 48:31.810
Sorry, pal,

48:31.937 --> 48:33.901
I already called dibs on her tonight.

48:33.936 --> 48:38.138
I have no idea what he...
He's drunk, obviously.

48:38.174 --> 48:39.184
Come on, let's not be coy.

48:39.208 --> 48:40.974
Get away from me.

48:41.010 --> 48:43.243
Hey, hey, buddy, I
think you better shove off.

48:43.279 --> 48:44.445
What...

48:44.480 --> 48:45.857
She fucks every other guy in the place

48:45.881 --> 48:48.449
but I get the sob story?

48:48.484 --> 48:49.817
You can have her.

48:49.852 --> 48:52.019
Fucking psycho.

48:55.024 --> 48:56.290
Are you all right?

48:56.325 --> 48:59.126
Yes, I'm fine.

48:59.161 --> 49:02.029
I should... I have to get home.

49:04.367 --> 49:09.103
So you go to AA for the stories?

49:09.138 --> 49:12.106
Well, I'm not an alcoholic.

49:12.141 --> 49:14.842
I try to attend meetings when I travel,

49:14.877 --> 49:16.610
but this is the first time I've ever run

49:16.645 --> 49:18.512
into someone I knew.

49:18.547 --> 49:23.283
Sorry if it was awkward for you.

49:23.319 --> 49:25.018
So...

49:25.054 --> 49:27.454
Uh, Virginia and Dan never married.

49:27.490 --> 49:29.957
We knew they wouldn't.

49:29.992 --> 49:31.737
You knew Virginia
would never give up her work

49:31.761 --> 49:34.228
and I knew Dan
would always return to me.

49:34.263 --> 49:37.064
We predicted it and we were right.

49:37.099 --> 49:41.235
We know our people.

49:41.270 --> 49:44.238
Oh, Virginia is, uh...

49:46.509 --> 49:50.077
Not my people.

49:50.112 --> 49:52.479
Jesus, I've been...

49:55.117 --> 49:57.885
So you come all this way to St. Louis

49:57.920 --> 49:59.386
to clean up after him,

49:59.422 --> 50:03.157
to tell his lover to back off?

50:03.192 --> 50:04.858
Someone had to.

50:04.894 --> 50:06.527
All for someone

50:06.562 --> 50:10.130
who lies to you, who, uh...

50:10.166 --> 50:13.500
disregards you?

50:13.536 --> 50:16.870
Who ultimately cannot love you.

50:19.542 --> 50:24.344
Can you possibly
hate yourself that much?

50:24.380 --> 50:27.181
Sometimes I do.

50:27.216 --> 50:30.417
But sometimes I don't.

50:30.453 --> 50:32.719
Surely people like us

50:32.755 --> 50:36.457
feel we deserve a certain...

50:36.492 --> 50:39.226
punishment?

50:39.261 --> 50:43.363
Or these things wouldn't keep happening.

50:43.399 --> 50:44.531
What matters for me

50:44.567 --> 50:48.569
is Dan loves me

50:48.604 --> 50:53.207
and I love him.

50:53.242 --> 50:55.943
No.

50:55.978 --> 50:59.112
That's not love.

50:59.148 --> 51:01.048
That's torture.

51:14.830 --> 51:16.763
And why were you taking pictures of us?

51:16.799 --> 51:18.665
I was practicing my long lens technique

51:18.701 --> 51:20.100
at various shutter speeds

51:20.135 --> 51:21.468
when you and Dr. Dreessen

51:21.504 --> 51:25.138
just happened to barge
into frame, lips locked.

51:25.174 --> 51:26.974
Is there some crime against kissing?

51:27.009 --> 51:29.943
No, but if Dr. Masters
and Mrs. Johnson find out

51:29.979 --> 51:34.114
I kept something
like this from them, well,

51:34.149 --> 51:36.517
I don't want to tell.

51:36.552 --> 51:39.086
But if you won't,

51:39.121 --> 51:42.689
I won't have any choice.

51:51.166 --> 51:52.533
I don't understand.

51:52.568 --> 51:55.536
They're married.

51:55.571 --> 51:57.204
To each other.

51:57.239 --> 52:00.874
I just spoke with Nancy
and she confessed to it all.

52:02.144 --> 52:04.444
I don't know what to say.

52:04.480 --> 52:06.213
And I don't know what we should do.

52:06.248 --> 52:07.681
There's only one thing to do.

52:07.716 --> 52:11.118
We can't allow our employees to lie.

52:11.153 --> 52:13.820
We'll have to let them both go.

52:13.856 --> 52:15.222
I'll bring them in here now.

52:15.257 --> 52:17.224
Bill, before you do...

52:17.259 --> 52:18.959
If they lied to us about this,

52:18.994 --> 52:21.061
who knows what they're capable of?

52:21.096 --> 52:23.130
But if we gave them a chance...

52:23.165 --> 52:24.631
Why would we do that?

52:24.667 --> 52:26.400
Because I'm sure they had their reasons.

52:26.435 --> 52:30.304
Everyone who lies has reasons.

52:30.339 --> 52:31.972
All I'm saying is I'm sure

52:32.007 --> 52:33.907
they would have told
the truth eventually.

52:33.943 --> 52:35.542
And why would you be so sure of that?

52:35.578 --> 52:38.278
Because people can't live
with a lie forever.

52:50.192 --> 52:54.261
So that's your decision?

52:54.296 --> 52:56.763
Well, I think...

52:56.799 --> 53:00.267
since you have spoken to
Nancy, I'll speak to Art.

53:00.302 --> 53:03.103
We'll let them both know
that they are on notice

53:03.138 --> 53:05.939
and then we move on.

53:15.217 --> 53:19.119
To say that we are disappointed

53:19.154 --> 53:21.388
would be an understatement.

53:21.423 --> 53:24.424
I don't recall ever seeing
Dr. Masters so upset.

53:24.460 --> 53:25.959
I can explain.

53:25.995 --> 53:28.962
I'm uninterested in your
reasons for lying.

53:28.998 --> 53:31.865
If it were up to Dr. Masters
you would be fired.

53:31.900 --> 53:35.135
And I agree with him.

53:35.170 --> 53:37.070
But given I have

53:37.106 --> 53:40.240
a more compassionate nature...

53:40.275 --> 53:41.170
I can see that you do.

53:41.171 --> 53:44.077
I might be willing to
fight for you and Nancy

53:44.113 --> 53:48.081
but it would require you
never lying to us again.

53:48.117 --> 53:49.716
Yes, that is understood.

53:49.752 --> 53:53.754
And I would also have
to know that you understand

53:53.789 --> 53:57.958
the importance in
this office of discretion,

53:57.993 --> 54:00.293
and for example, I would need to know

54:00.329 --> 54:03.130
that you would never mention to anyone

54:03.165 --> 54:06.299
seeing me last night.

54:07.536 --> 54:09.736
Last night?

54:09.772 --> 54:10.771
Of course not.

54:10.806 --> 54:12.239
I... I have no intention.

54:12.274 --> 54:14.675
What you saw...

54:14.710 --> 54:17.110
Well, my husband and I,

54:17.146 --> 54:19.613
we have an agreement,

54:19.648 --> 54:21.148
an arrangement,

54:21.183 --> 54:23.617
and that is nobody's
business but our own.

54:23.652 --> 54:26.353
Please, you don't have to explain.

54:26.388 --> 54:28.021
In the interest of never lying again,

54:28.057 --> 54:32.159
I'll tell you I'm
also in an open marriage.

54:32.194 --> 54:35.328
So I judge no one, ever,

54:35.364 --> 54:37.330
when it comes to these things.

54:41.136 --> 54:44.471
All right then.

54:44.506 --> 54:47.040
So we understand each other.
