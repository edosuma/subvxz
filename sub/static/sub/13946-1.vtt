- Let's go. Should be time for lockup.
- Let me get that for you, Manny.

10:23.331 --> 10:26.458
What's been happening
these past three years?

10:26.584 --> 10:30.545
Just what you know, brother. I went out
and got a fresh 30-year sentence.

10:30.671 --> 10:33.340
- Couldn't make it without me.
- Couldn't make it without the money.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.676
- Never did know how to rob a bank.
- (Man) Hiya, Manny!

10:36.802 --> 10:40.180
Don't worry about it.
I'll get you out.

- The kid can fight.
- That's worth about two dead flies.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.717
Yeah, but you shouldn't
judge people hard, man.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.677
I'm gonna take a piss.

12:01.595 --> 12:06.015

- (Manny) Come on, punk.
- You're wrong!

13:44.698 --> 13:46.491
Show me something.

13:53.874 --> 13:57.585
- Come on, Manny.
- (Manny) Think I'm that stupid?

13:57.711 --> 14:00.171
- Come on. I got something for you.
- I'm sorry, Manny.

14:00.297 --> 14:05.844
- No! Stay back!
- (Manny) You want my blood? Here.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.972
There. There's my blood.
Come on, scum.

14:13.477 --> 14:15.937
You wanna shoot me?
Shoot me!

Here I am!

I'm right here. Come on. Shoot me!
I'm going nowhere. Come on!

Hey, sucker.
You show me shit!

14:38.836 --> 14:41.212
No, bro, he's mine!

14:47.344 --> 14:49.220
Get off! Hey, get off!
Let me go!

14:53.517 --> 14:54.976
Jonah! Jonah!

14:55.102 --> 14:57.770
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

14:58.689 --> 15:00.899
I'll tear your fucking head off!

15:03.152 --> 15:05.486
Oh, my God! Can't someone do
something about it?

15:08.616 --> 15:13.202
(Tannoy)'Mandatory lockup!
All prisoners in their cell.

I ain't dead.

15:56.705 --> 15:58.706
They released me to the yard.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.377
He wants to kill you for sure.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.420
Nah, he's pushing me.

16:04.546 --> 16:07.215
He wants me to jump the wall.
He's pushing me.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.968
It's 30 below out there.

16:10.094 --> 16:12.553
I'm going. You coming?

16:12.680 --> 16:16.099
Are you coming? I'll wait for you.

16:18.894 --> 16:21.354
No, brother.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.106
This is home.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.817
I run things around here.

16:25.943 --> 16:29.112
I can't take these ass-kickings
like I used to.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.995
I can make it.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.455
Then get on, brother, and do it.

16:42.334 --> 16:43.418
I will.

16:44.628 --> 16:47.338

don't let'em bring you back here.

watching you, brother.

Coming through, boss.
Coming through!

18:14.176 --> 18:16.469
- Just hold your horses!
- Yeah.

18:18.639 --> 18:21.891
- How are you doing, Jackson?
- What's up?

18:22.017 --> 18:23.851
Little bit of laundry, huh?

18:30.067 --> 18:34.237
Jackson, have I got
a surprise for you, man.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.447
- What is it?
- You know, you told me your son

18:36.573 --> 18:38.658
is going to the golden gloves
this year.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.285
- Yeah.
- Yeah...

18:44.998 --> 18:47.959
Jackson, check'em out, man.

18:50.587 --> 18:52.630
- Thanks, Buck.
- You betcha.

18:56.343 --> 18:59.053
And I'll tell you what, Jackson,

18:59.179 --> 19:01.305
since you have always been
so goddamn good to me,

19:01.431 --> 19:03.349
you get these suckers for $80.

19:03.475 --> 19:06.310
They go for 200,
but you got'em for $80, boss.

19:06.436 --> 19:09.355
- I don't have $80, Buck.
- No problem. I tell you what we'll do.

19:09.481 --> 19:14.026
We'll put you on layaway plan.
That is, you get me when you get me.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.487
- All right, my man.
- No problem. This could work out.

19:18.657 --> 19:21.576
- This is all right.
- Yeah. Yeah. Nice, huh?

19:21.702 --> 19:23.536
This is all right.

- Ain't she, Jackson?
- All right.

19:44.766 --> 19:48.561
Yeah, that Hugh Hefner sure knows
what the fuck he's doing, don't he?

19:48.687 --> 19:50.605
- Yeah.
- You got that right.

19:50.731 --> 19:54.317
Hey, Jackson?
She might be white, but she's right.

19:54.443 --> 19:57.195
Right on, Buck.
Hey, let me give you a hand.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.238
Uh, all right.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.325
Hey, Jackson?

20:04.786 --> 20:07.538
- You tell your boy I said good luck.
- Thanks.

20:07.664 --> 20:10.166
- Thanks for everything, man.
- You betcha.

20:24.014 --> 20:26.807
Just walking with the laundry, boss!

20:26.934 --> 20:28.184
(Lock buzzes)

20:39.154 --> 20:42.907
See, white pussy gets that
son of a bitch every goddamn time.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.659
(Manny) Shut up.

20:50.499 --> 20:53.668
All right, man. Come on.
Go for it.

20:56.255 --> 20:59.715
- Thanks, youngster. I owe you one.
- Hey, Manny. Take me with you.

21:05.055 --> 21:09.892
Shit, man. I'm going.
I'm going, man. I'm fucking going.

21:10.018 --> 21:14.772
Yeah. Damn, I'm going.
I'm getting out of here.

21:17.609 --> 21:20.027
Manny? Hey, Manny!

21:20.153 --> 21:22.905
Shut up, fooI.
What are you doing here?

21:24.616 --> 21:27.910
- Hey, you need me, man.
- What good are you?

21:28.036 --> 21:31.414
Shit, I got two hands to your one,
I can more than carry my own weight.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.041
And, look, I got us sweat clothes.

21:35.168 --> 21:37.712
Son of a bitch. OK, fooI.

21:37.838 --> 21:39.797
Get your clothes off
and grease down.

21:39.923 --> 21:41.507
(Buck) All right.

21:53.103 --> 21:56.105
Ooh, mama. This shit is nasty.

21:59.943 --> 22:01.110
Goddamn.

22:16.585 --> 22:18.461
OK, Manny.
What do we do now?

22:19.421 --> 22:22.506
Keep your mouth shut.
You talk too much.

23:00.962 --> 23:04.131
- (Manny) Coming down.
- We got to go in there?

23:04.257 --> 23:06.342
(Manny) I am.

23:11.681 --> 23:13.140
Duffle bag.

23:15.977 --> 23:18.062
Pull the cover over.

23:21.358 --> 23:24.985
Oh, man.
I don't like this shit.

23:25.570 --> 23:28.197
(Manny) Let's go. Come on!

23:34.704 --> 23:37.832
(Buck) I'm coming, man.
I'm coming.

23:37.958 --> 23:40.126
(Manny) Keep up.

23:40.794 --> 23:45.798
- It stinks in here, man. Goddamn!
- (Manny) Never been in a sewer before?

23:45.924 --> 23:48.801
Manny, wait up a minute. Wait up.

23:48.927 --> 23:51.262
Manny, I put my hands
in a pile of shit.

23:51.388 --> 23:53.806
(Manny) Don't worry. It'll rinse off.

23:55.225 --> 23:58.477
- Here, give me that.
- (Buck retches)

23:58.603 --> 24:01.939
(Manny) If you're gonna get sick,
this is the place to do it.

24:02.065 --> 24:06.485
Man, this is nasty! This is nasty!
Goddamn!

24:08.655 --> 24:10.948
Wait, man...

24:14.035 --> 24:17.079
Oh, man. This is so gross!

24:17.205 --> 24:20.124
- OK. What do we do now?
- Here, hold it.

24:21.793 --> 24:24.920
Hold it! Like a baby, hold it!

24:25.922 --> 24:28.591
(Buck) It stinks in here, man.

24:28.717 --> 24:32.761
(Manny) You don't like that smell?
That's the smell of freedom, brother.

24:50.655 --> 24:53.073
- I'm going.
- Wait. OK, wait.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.828
- (Buck) Here, man.
- Give me the light.

24:57.954 --> 25:00.080
- (Buck) Yeah, the light.
- Duffle bag.

25:03.043 --> 25:05.002
(Buck) OK. Wait, man.

25:06.546 --> 25:09.632
You know, Ranken's gonna
fucking shit his pants, man!

25:09.758 --> 25:11.884
Ranken's gonna fucking die.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.844
(Clanging)

25:13.970 --> 25:17.139
Hey, Manny?

25:17.265 --> 25:18.933
- Where's the light?
- Fell.

25:19.059 --> 25:21.519
- Where did it fall?
- About 300 feet in the American River.

25:21.645 --> 25:23.938
Nobody told me about 300 feet.
I'm scared of heights.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.981
(Manny) Nobody told you
cos nobody invited you.

25:26.107 --> 25:27.983
- You wanna go back, go ahead.
- No, man.

25:28.109 --> 25:30.152
- Me, I'm going.
- No, man.

25:30.278 --> 25:32.988
(Buck) Manny! Manny!

25:45.877 --> 25:47.836
Manny!

25:50.006 --> 25:52.049
I'm dying!

25:52.175 --> 25:54.885
Manny, I can't breathe!

25:56.805 --> 25:58.222
Manny!

26:07.274 --> 26:09.858
(Inmates chant) Manny! Manny!

26:33.008 --> 26:34.550
They came this way,
all right.

26:34.676 --> 26:37.595
- No doubt about it.
- He did it.

26:38.805 --> 26:42.850
Son of a bitch, he did it.
OK...

26:42.976 --> 26:45.060
(Chanting) Manny! Manny!

27:11.254 --> 27:13.213
Stop searching the prison.

27:13.340 --> 27:16.925
Notify the state police and get their
pictures out. You know what to do.

27:19.763 --> 27:22.765
God, don't kill them.

27:24.100 --> 27:25.809
Let me do it.

27:51.294 --> 27:54.588
Manny, hold up a goddamn minute!

27:54.714 --> 27:57.675
(Manny) Get your taiI out
from between your legs.

27:58.551 --> 28:00.886
Manny, I don't wanna die!

28:01.012 --> 28:04.932
- (Manny) I'm hurting too.
- At least you got shoes!

28:05.058 --> 28:08.060
How much farther
we got to go, man?

28:08.186 --> 28:10.145
Half a mile. Who knows?

28:11.439 --> 28:13.816
Maybe I can make a half a mile.

28:17.696 --> 28:21.573
Oh, man. Shoes! I need shoes!

29:18.339 --> 29:20.090
Oh, man.

29:21.551 --> 29:23.802
Put that bench
next to the door there.

29:31.352 --> 29:33.937
I need some fucking shoes.

29:34.063 --> 29:37.566
You know, it's unbelievable, man.

29:37.692 --> 29:40.277
Only two other guys
even got out once,

29:40.403 --> 29:43.822
and you beat that sucker
three times, yeah.

29:45.283 --> 29:50.287
Manny. Hey, don't you know
Ranken is pissed off, man.

29:50.413 --> 29:55.083
Shit. And the dudes, man.
Oh, Manny. The dudes.

29:55.210 --> 29:57.961
They love it. They love it.

30:01.382 --> 30:03.759
- Freeze, sucker!
- Hey, man. Nobody's gonna hear us.

30:03.885 --> 30:06.512
Just don't do it.

30:10.767 --> 30:15.270
Hey, Manny... You don't treat me
like a punk, OK?

30:15.396 --> 30:17.689
- Well, you don't like it?
- No.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.733
Well, you're a prizefighter.

30:21.152 --> 30:25.113
Kick my ass. Make your move.

30:27.617 --> 30:28.784
No...

30:30.245 --> 30:34.122
I'm not gonna give you
no reason to kill me.

30:37.627 --> 30:40.170
- Please don't.
- OK.

30:41.089 --> 30:43.298
I need some shoes, Manny.

30:46.427 --> 30:48.929
What we got?

30:49.055 --> 30:51.890
Shoes.
Let there be shoes, man.

30:52.016 --> 30:55.269
I want that, Manny. I want that.

30:55.395 --> 30:57.229
Shit.

31:03.152 --> 31:05.863
I need some shoes, man.
I need some...

31:07.156 --> 31:11.034
Manny! Check it out, man.
Check it out!

31:11.160 --> 31:13.871
Take one for your stomach.
Give it here.

31:17.458 --> 31:20.168
Ooh, mama!
That shit is fine!

31:20.295 --> 31:22.087
(Knocking)

31:24.215 --> 31:26.258
(Knocking)

31:34.309 --> 31:39.646
- OK, come on. Let's go.
- Wait, man. I need shoes.

31:39.772 --> 31:41.732
I got shoes.

31:41.858 --> 31:44.610
I need socks.
I got fucking socks.

31:48.698 --> 31:52.200
Give me a minute, man.
Just a minute.

31:54.162 --> 31:56.079
OK...

32:06.716 --> 32:09.051
- Let's get this sucker.
- You know where it's going?

32:09.177 --> 32:11.428
- Anywhere's fine by me.
- Not all of them are going anywhere.

32:11.554 --> 32:13.138
I don't wanna go to a parking lot.

32:18.061 --> 32:21.104
- Hey, look. Look here.
- What?

32:21.230 --> 32:24.024
There's my limousine
to Broadway right there.

32:24.150 --> 32:25.359
Why?

32:28.029 --> 32:29.863
Why that one?

32:29.989 --> 32:31.490
Cos I want it.

34:45.541 --> 34:48.168
We're moving, man. We're moving!

34:48.293 --> 34:50.504
Thank you, Jesus. Shit!

34:50.630 --> 34:54.466
Shit, we make a hell of a team,
don't we, man?

34:56.177 --> 34:57.844
Don't we?

35:19.575 --> 35:21.576
(Gasping)

35:24.497 --> 35:26.331
(Groaning)

35:44.559 --> 35:48.353
- Hey, that looks like Al's train!
- What in hell's he doing out there?

35:48.479 --> 35:52.691
He looks sick! Damn!
Damn! Al!

35:55.486 --> 35:57.445
Better call the paramedics!

36:07.623 --> 36:09.499
(Manny) Something's wrong.

36:09.625 --> 36:13.336
Take it easy, Manny.
They know what they're doing.

36:16.674 --> 36:16.715
Pulasky! Hello, Pulasky!

36:18.551 --> 36:20.218
-'Pulasky.'
- This is Cassidy.

36:20.344 --> 36:22.512
Al fell off the engine. He's dead.

36:22.638 --> 36:25.223
You've got a runaway
coming your way on track two!

36:25.349 --> 36:27.392
- What did you say?
-'Four units.

36:27.518 --> 36:30.061
'Stop them, for God's sakes!
Speak up, Pulasky!'

36:30.188 --> 36:32.731
Er... OK. Switch it to track 11.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.900
I can't, it's too late!

36:39.363 --> 36:42.574
CentraI?
Damn you, CentraI!

36:43.451 --> 36:44.743
Emergency!

36:45.578 --> 36:47.287
Pick up the goddamn phone!

36:47.413 --> 36:49.331
(Phone beeping)

36:50.791 --> 36:54.211
Ooh, boy, would I like to have
some of this here for dessert!

36:54.337 --> 36:58.173
To go. Hey, Ruby.
Why don't you answer the phone?

36:58.299 --> 37:00.884
Hey, come on, Ruby!
You pretty enough.

37:02.762 --> 37:07.599
Oh, shit. Your ass is so lazy, I don't
know why the fuck you got a job here.

37:07.725 --> 37:09.768
Yeah, CentraI.
Dave Prince speaking.

37:09.894 --> 37:12.270
-'This is Pulasky. Get me Barstow.'
- Hold it, Pulasky.

37:12.396 --> 37:14.981
Hold it, my ass!
Where the hell is Barstow?

37:15.107 --> 37:17.025
We got an emergency,
a big emergency!

37:17.151 --> 37:19.402
-'We got four unmanned units!'
- What?

37:19.528 --> 37:23.657
I said we got runaway units.
Four of them. They're headed this way.

37:24.742 --> 37:28.578
Ruby, go get Frank now.
Run! Come on!

37:28.704 --> 37:32.040
Goddamn it, get moving now,
we got an emergency here!

37:32.166 --> 37:35.043
Hold it, Pulasky, OK?
He's coming.

37:37.004 --> 37:38.588
It's the phone, Frankie.

37:44.679 --> 37:48.056
Frank, get your ass out here, man.
We've got a runaway on 11!

37:53.396 --> 37:55.355
'CentraI, where are you?
Goddamn it!'

37:55.481 --> 37:57.315
I'm here, Pulasky.
What seems to be the trouble?

37:57.441 --> 38:01.069
'We got a runaway on track 11.
Goddamn engineer fell off the train!'

38:01.195 --> 38:04.072
- You sure nobody else is on board?
-'How the hell do I know?

38:04.198 --> 38:06.366
It's already gone about nine miles,
and it's increasing speed!

38:06.492 --> 38:08.493
- Nine miles already?
-'That's right!

38:08.619 --> 38:12.414
-'What the hell are we gonna do?'
- Be quiet! Calm down!

38:12.540 --> 38:16.626
Look, I want you to line her
on the main line on track one.

38:16.752 --> 38:18.253
-'OK.'
- You got it?

38:18.379 --> 38:21.464
- I'll take things over from there.
- Right, Frank.

38:21.590 --> 38:25.343
(Alarm beeping)

38:43.863 --> 38:45.113
(Hissing)

38:45.239 --> 38:46.990
Shit!

39:08.971 --> 39:10.930
This sucker is flying, Manny.

39:11.057 --> 39:13.516
We shoulda hooked
into those freight cars by now.

39:13.642 --> 39:15.852
Smile, man. We're free. Yeah!

39:17.229 --> 39:19.522
- You think so, huh?
- Yeah.

39:28.699 --> 39:33.036
Manny. I want you to know I'm proud
to be hooked up with you, partner.

39:34.413 --> 39:35.914
Look, kid.

39:36.040 --> 39:39.542
I appreciate what you done,
but you ain't no kind of partner to me.

39:39.668 --> 39:42.504
Don't be clowning yourself.
Look at them tattoos.

39:42.630 --> 39:45.715
They'll look really nice
in a swimming pooI in Acapulco.

39:50.346 --> 39:52.972
What did I do to deserve all this shit
you're slinging at me?

39:53.099 --> 39:55.975
You don't know nothing from nothing.
Being around me is really stupid.

39:56.102 --> 39:58.895
I'm at war with the world
and everybody in it.

39:59.021 --> 40:01.564
And you're gonna get hurt.

40:04.777 --> 40:07.737
- I don't get you, man.
- Well, rapos usually are pretty dumb.

40:07.863 --> 40:10.490
Rapo?
I ain't no goddamn rapo, man!

40:10.616 --> 40:12.367
Where'd you get that from?

40:12.493 --> 40:15.453
It's on your rap sheet.
Busted for rape two years ago.

40:15.996 --> 40:17.664
Shit, man!

40:19.291 --> 40:21.709
That was a statutory rape.

40:21.836 --> 40:25.255
She was 15
and I was older than her.

40:25.381 --> 40:26.923
That's good.

40:32.304 --> 40:34.431
What's wrong with you?
You dying for company?

40:34.557 --> 40:38.351
What? You expect somebody
to be watching or something?

40:38.477 --> 40:40.395
I expect nothing.

40:47.111 --> 40:50.405
She's gaining speed reaI fast.
She'll hit your territory in no time.

40:50.531 --> 40:54.200
-'The brakes are burning up.'
- Are you nuts?

40:55.911 --> 40:59.122
- The brakes on the runaway burnt off.
- How in the fuck did that happen?

40:59.248 --> 41:01.207
Didn't they check it?

41:01.333 --> 41:03.585
The throttle must be jammed
wide open in run eight.

41:03.711 --> 41:05.170
Oh, damn!

41:06.714 --> 41:10.258
- There she goes.
- Oh, God, man. What are we gonna do?

41:10.926 --> 41:14.762
I got a wife and two kids. I ain't got
no money like MichaeI Jackson.

41:14.889 --> 41:17.432
- Come on, the system's foolproof.
- Shit!

41:17.558 --> 41:19.601
Why? Because you designed it?

41:19.727 --> 41:21.686
That I did, my boy.
And I know how to use it.

41:21.812 --> 41:23.897
Now let me show you.

41:58.265 --> 42:00.600
We'd better fly over the highway.

42:00.726 --> 42:02.393
Are you serious?

42:02.520 --> 42:04.854
Jesus, those scum could never
make it this far out.

42:04.980 --> 42:07.190
We're up here freezing our asses off
for nothing.

42:07.316 --> 42:10.527
Hey, shut your mouth
and keep your eyes on the glacier.

42:10.653 --> 42:15.865
This guy... I'm telling you.
He'd do the same thing I would do.

42:44.395 --> 42:49.524
Hey, I just thought about that bank
that you ripped off in Reno.

42:49.650 --> 42:53.027
I was in reform schooI.
Man, that was so fucking great.

42:53.153 --> 42:56.698
Two million simoleons.
Man, that was hot.

42:56.824 --> 43:00.118
Two million is
a slight exaggeration.

43:00.244 --> 43:03.246
The insurance company,
standard procedure.

43:03.372 --> 43:06.958
It was still fucking great, man.
Tell you what...

43:13.299 --> 43:18.094
Hey, Manny...
I know this jug outside Frisco,

43:18.220 --> 43:19.887
it's good for half a million.

43:20.014 --> 43:24.684
They had a payroll for S&H Sugar...
S&H Sugar is a big outfit, man.

43:26.270 --> 43:28.521
Yeah, that's what I've been
dreaming about.

43:28.647 --> 43:31.482
A really good score,
you know what I mean?

43:32.443 --> 43:35.945
And I'm gonna party.
Ooh, yeah, shit!

43:36.071 --> 43:38.990
I'm gonna go to Mardi Gras,
I'm gonna go to Vegas,

43:39.116 --> 43:41.284
and I'm gonna go with enough money
in my hip pocket

43:41.410 --> 43:43.870
to catch'em fine bitches,
you know what I mean?

43:43.996 --> 43:48.333
You know, I've spent
almost every night of my life

43:48.459 --> 43:50.627
dreaming about this kind of shit.

43:50.753 --> 43:53.004
- Dreaming?
- Yeah.

43:54.256 --> 43:55.715
Dreaming.

43:57.009 --> 43:59.135
That's bullshit.

43:59.261 --> 44:01.721
You're not gonna do
nothing like that.

44:01.847 --> 44:03.890
I'll tell you what you're gonna do!

44:04.016 --> 44:06.851
You're gonna get a job.
That's what you're gonna do.

44:06.977 --> 44:10.063
You're gonna get a little job
some job a convict can get,

44:10.189 --> 44:13.691
like scraping off trays at a cafeteria
or cleaning out toilets.

44:13.817 --> 44:17.862
And you're gonna hold on to that job
like gold because it is gold!

44:17.988 --> 44:22.200
Let me tell you, Jack. That is gold.
You listening to me?

44:23.827 --> 44:27.288
And when that man walks in
at the end of the day,

44:27.414 --> 44:29.499
and he comes to see
how you done,

44:29.625 --> 44:33.753
you ain't gonna look in his eyes,
you're gonna look at the floor,

44:33.879 --> 44:36.214
because you don't wanna see
that fear in his eyes

44:36.340 --> 44:40.176
when you jump up and grab his face
and slam him to the floor

44:40.302 --> 44:42.095
and make him scream and cry
for his life.

44:42.221 --> 44:46.015
So you look right at the floor, Jack.
Pay attention, motherfucker.

44:47.601 --> 44:49.977
And then he's gonna look around
the room, see how you done.

44:50.104 --> 44:53.022
He's gonna say, "Oh, you missed
a little spot over there.

44:53.148 --> 44:57.860
"Jeez, you didn't get this one here.
What about this little bitty spot?"

44:57.986 --> 45:00.947
And you're gonna suck
all that pain inside you

45:01.073 --> 45:03.741
and you're gonna clean that spot.

45:03.867 --> 45:06.661
And you're gonna clean that spot,

45:06.787 --> 45:09.706
untiI you get that shining clean.

45:11.542 --> 45:15.044
And on Friday,
you'll pick up your paycheque.

45:15.170 --> 45:17.380
And if you could do that,

45:17.506 --> 45:21.426
you could be president
of Chase Manhattan, corporations!

45:21.552 --> 45:23.594
If you could do that.

45:24.304 --> 45:29.142
Not me, man. I wouldn't do that
kind of shit. I'd rather be in jaiI.

45:32.312 --> 45:35.940
More's the pity, youngster.
More's the pity.

45:36.066 --> 45:38.192
Could you do that kind of shit?

45:42.698 --> 45:44.657
I wish I could.

45:52.583 --> 45:54.459
I wish I could.

46:49.264 --> 46:50.932
CentraI, CentraI.

46:51.058 --> 46:55.061
- Eastbound 12, eastbound 12.
- Barstow here.

46:55.187 --> 46:59.106
- Why did you stop us?
-'There's a runaway coming at you.

46:59.233 --> 47:02.443
'Hear me?
Number 12, answer me!'

47:02.569 --> 47:04.320
I don't see any runaway.

47:04.446 --> 47:07.532
'If you were close enough to see her,
you'd be dead. Get it?

47:07.658 --> 47:12.203
'She's about four miles away.
Pull onto track two at once.

47:12.329 --> 47:15.122
-'Repeat, at once.'
- Oh, my God!

47:16.667 --> 47:19.961
- Are you serious?
- Hey, Ruby. What's going on?

47:20.087 --> 47:23.214
- You can't go in there right now.
- Come on, Ruby.

47:30.639 --> 47:32.974
(Alarm signaI beeping)

47:50.659 --> 47:52.910
That eastbound 12 is crawling.

47:53.036 --> 47:56.622
Who's the incompetent bastard on her?
He better get in the clear fast!

49:07.527 --> 49:08.736
Oh, man.

49:12.741 --> 49:14.825
Oh, Manny.

49:14.952 --> 49:18.329
I told you. Didn't I tell you?
I told you something was fucked up.

49:18.455 --> 49:21.749
- Maybe we're on some express run.
- Wake up, wacko!

49:21.875 --> 49:24.460
We just blew the caboose to hell
without even slowing down!

49:24.586 --> 49:27.463
Something screwy
is going on here. Look!

49:27.589 --> 49:30.257
All the handrails are gone!
Maybe the engineer has croaked.

49:30.384 --> 49:33.010
Hey, man.
Engineers do not just croak!

49:33.136 --> 49:36.055
Why don't the whistle ever blow, huh?

49:37.933 --> 49:40.476
What are you, out of your mind?

49:40.602 --> 49:44.021
I just wanted to see if it worked.
You said the engineer was croaked.

49:46.817 --> 49:48.734
Let go.

49:50.654 --> 49:52.655
You think this is some
cops and robbers game.

49:52.781 --> 49:55.741
Hey, man. You picked the train!

49:57.911 --> 50:00.204
- You're right.
- Yeah.

50:16.763 --> 50:20.808
(Radio)'State police calling
Chopper One. Come in, please.

50:20.934 --> 50:22.810
'State police calling Chopper One.

50:22.936 --> 50:25.146
'We have information
regarding escaped prisoners.'

50:25.272 --> 50:27.273
Ranken, that's your radio.

50:29.067 --> 50:32.987
'Railroad security called. They found
some prison clothes in a switch yard.

50:33.113 --> 50:35.322
'Looks like your prisoners.'

50:35.449 --> 50:39.368
- How'd they get so far?
- What did I tell you?

50:39.494 --> 50:43.289
Tell'em I'll be there in ten minutes.
Have some officers ready.

50:43.415 --> 50:46.584
(Pilot) Roger, state police.
We're on our way.

50:46.710 --> 50:48.836
Let's have some fun.

51:13.361 --> 51:16.280
Maybe we just oughta
clear out of here.

51:16.406 --> 51:19.366
Maybe we oughta jump for it.
What do you say?

51:23.747 --> 51:26.290
We can break our necks
any time we want.

51:31.254 --> 51:33.756
Yeah, that makes sense.

51:33.882 --> 51:37.134
- Let's find out what's happening.
- How are we gonna do that?

51:37.260 --> 51:39.595
- Go up front and find out.
- Yeah.

51:39.721 --> 51:42.431
Find out what's happening.

51:42.557 --> 51:44.934
Go up front and find out
what the hell is going on.

51:51.525 --> 51:53.442
I want that, man.

52:00.951 --> 52:05.037
- For what?
- Tuck that in on you someplace.

52:05.163 --> 52:06.580
All right.

52:06.706 --> 52:10.084
And wait till I give you
the order before you attack.

52:10.794 --> 52:12.294
Yeah.

52:20.720 --> 52:23.556
Hello, Mr MacDonald.

52:23.682 --> 52:25.975
Don't tell anyone about the runaway.

52:26.101 --> 52:28.352
We don't want to panic
the passengers.

52:28.478 --> 52:30.729
Besides, we've got the company's
reputation to uphold.

52:30.856 --> 52:32.481
What's the latest on that train?

52:32.607 --> 52:35.693
It went straight through the caboose
at Granville 12.

52:38.238 --> 52:40.865
What? Anyone hurt?

52:40.991 --> 52:43.033
Nobody. What's the story
on the engineer?

52:43.160 --> 52:45.119
He had a heart attack. Old fart.

52:45.245 --> 52:48.164
He made everyone bananas keeping
that old engine from going to scrap.

52:48.290 --> 52:50.749
Get that.
What's the speed?

52:50.876 --> 52:52.543
About 70.

52:53.795 --> 52:56.922
Hey, Barstow.
Why don't you stop her?

52:57.048 --> 52:58.591
You put the system in.

52:58.717 --> 53:02.261
- Cost the company 4.5 million.
- Listen, Eddie...

53:02.387 --> 53:04.847
It's designed for the efficient
dispatching of trains

53:04.973 --> 53:07.141
when they're manned
not unmanned.

53:07.267 --> 53:09.310
The brake shoes have burned off
and the overspeed controI

53:09.436 --> 53:12.104
musta gotten screwed up
from the collision!

53:12.230 --> 53:16.192
But don't worry, Eddie. We'll do all
we can to avoid any more casualties.

53:16.318 --> 53:18.694
Frank, you haven't forgotten
about the Seneca Bridge?

53:18.820 --> 53:20.487
Dave, could you get us some coffee!

53:20.614 --> 53:22.948
- What about the bridge?
- I'm taking care of it.

53:23.074 --> 53:25.784
- What about the bridge?
- Seneca is an old bridge.

53:25.911 --> 53:28.287
So what?
Are you gonna get the coffee?

53:29.873 --> 53:34.919
Mr MacDonald, by the time that runaway
reaches this bridge, it'll be doing 90.

53:35.045 --> 53:37.755
The restriction
for that bridge is 50.

53:59.694 --> 54:02.112
Get that runaway on the spur
in Jordan and deraiI her.

54:02.239 --> 54:04.990
- Best idea, sir.
- I don't need you to tell me I'm right!

54:05.116 --> 54:07.451
DeraiI that son of a bitch!
I don't care about engines!

54:07.577 --> 54:09.954
- I don't want to lose the bridge!
- Hey, this system is designed

54:10.080 --> 54:12.498
so that I can get everyone
out of our way and onto the siding.

54:12.624 --> 54:14.291
Meanwhile,
we'll think of something else.

54:14.417 --> 54:17.253
Right now, it's just four engines,
no people aboard.

54:17.379 --> 54:21.590
If I let you jerk off with your system,
this wild animaI's gonna kill somebody!

54:21.716 --> 54:23.842
You know what that'll cost
the company? Do you?

54:26.221 --> 54:28.472
DeraiI her. That's my order.

54:28.598 --> 54:31.433
(Frank) You say deraiI,
then we deraiI.

54:31.559 --> 54:34.770
But these people are witnesses.
It's your decision, Eddie.

54:35.939 --> 54:38.607
Yeah. Yeah, it's my decision.

54:40.485 --> 54:42.820
(Frank)'CentraI calling Jordan.

54:43.488 --> 54:46.073
'SignaI maintainer 40.
This is an emergency.

54:46.199 --> 54:49.535
'SignaI maintainer 40, acknowledge.
This is an emergency!

54:49.661 --> 54:51.829
'CentraI calling Jordan.

54:51.955 --> 54:55.249
'SignaI maintainer 40, come in.
Where the hell are you?

54:55.375 --> 54:58.585
-'CentraI calling Jordan!'
- Jordan.

54:58.712 --> 55:01.755
- SignaI maintainer 40 here.
-'CentraI here.

55:01.881 --> 55:05.259
'There's an unmanned runaway
heading west on track one.

55:05.385 --> 55:07.219
'You're gonna have to line her
into the siding.

55:07.345 --> 55:09.388
'Use the manuaI switch,
then get out of the way.'

55:09.514 --> 55:12.057
Superintendent MacDonald
wants to deraiI her.

55:12.183 --> 55:15.227
You got that name?
Mr Eddie MacDonald.

55:15.353 --> 55:17.563
I'll be goddamned.

55:17.689 --> 55:19.315
Son of a bitch!

56:09.532 --> 56:11.784
(Whistle blows)

56:13.870 --> 56:14.953
Hear that?

56:15.080 --> 56:17.414
(Whistle blasting)

56:18.833 --> 56:21.126
Come on, Manny!

56:29.010 --> 56:31.804
See? I told you, Manny!

56:31.930 --> 56:34.932
Ooh! I knew we had an engineer
on this sucker!

56:35.058 --> 56:38.394
- All right, kid.
- I say blow, baby, blow!

56:52.242 --> 56:55.369
Boy, this is gonna be something.

56:55.495 --> 56:57.621
(Whistle in distance)

57:04.003 --> 57:07.089
SignaI maintainer 40 here.
Eh, Jordan.

57:07.215 --> 57:09.383
- (Frank)'CentraI.'
- Listen...

57:09.509 --> 57:12.886
Did I hear you right that that runaway
is supposed to be unmanned?

57:13.012 --> 57:16.432
- Yeah, that's right.
-'Well, let me tell you something.'

57:16.558 --> 57:18.392
I think you're wrong.

57:18.518 --> 57:20.185
(Whistle blasts)

57:21.855 --> 57:25.232
The whistle!
The goddamn whistle's blowing!

57:25.358 --> 57:28.735
Derailing is out!
Run, old man. Line her through!

57:31.531 --> 57:35.534
Somebody's blowing the whistle and
you woulda killed them just like that!

57:35.660 --> 57:36.869
My God!

58:42.810 --> 58:44.311
OK, next hurdle.

58:44.437 --> 58:48.148
Come on, big train.
I'll slap your big fat dieseI ass.

58:48.274 --> 58:49.733
Come on!

59:26.646 --> 59:29.439
Do you like them anchovies?

59:31.901 --> 59:33.694
I don't remember having any.

59:35.530 --> 59:38.907
If you had them,
you'd remember.

59:39.033 --> 59:41.451
I tell you what.

59:43.621 --> 59:46.790
- Get over here.
- What?

59:50.086 --> 59:54.548
- I don't think he saw us.
- OK. What do we do now?

59:54.674 --> 59:56.300
Let him come.

59:56.426 --> 59:59.386
When he gets two-thirds
through that door, we'll naiI him.

59:59.512 --> 01:00:01.388
Oh...

01:00:01.514 --> 01:00:04.016
- We ain't gonna kill him, are we?
- No.

01:00:04.142 --> 01:00:06.018
OK.

01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:08.979
Unless we have to.

01:00:09.105 --> 01:00:11.481
We'll find out what's going on.

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:13.984
Yeah... that makes sense.

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.114
Oh, man.

01:00:22.201 --> 01:00:26.872
He's in trouble out there.
Let's go help him. Come on, let's go...

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:02.074
Ah, man.

01:01:08.247 --> 01:01:10.707
What are you doing here?

01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:14.378
What am I...? I work on this train.
What are you doing here?

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:18.548
What are we doing here?
I'll tell you what we're doing here.

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:24.137
We're on our way to Las Vegas
to see our close friend Wayne Newton.

01:01:24.263 --> 01:01:28.684
Why? Are you collecting tickets
or something, sweetheart?

01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:33.271
Hey, sweetheart, how would you
like a really good fuck, huh?

01:01:33.398 --> 01:01:35.899
Just try it!

01:01:36.025 --> 01:01:38.151
Freeze on that bullshit.

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:45.075
What happened to you?

01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:47.661
I was tired.
I was taking a nap.

01:01:48.996 --> 01:01:52.207
I shouldn't have done it,
but I did it. So what?

01:01:52.333 --> 01:01:55.502
My head got hit when
we slammed into that caboose.

01:01:55.628 --> 01:01:58.755
I don't know what happened,
but there's no engineer on this train.

01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:00.924
There's nobody on this train
but us!

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:03.135
She's Iying.
We heard the whistle.

01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:06.471
- I blew the whistle!
- You're trying to get us busted.

01:02:06.597 --> 01:02:09.266
Listen! This runaway's gonna run
into something very fast.

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:13.729
I climbed back here, the last engine,
where it's safer. Don't you get it?

01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:19.693
I don't believe her bullshit.

01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:22.070
You don't believe me?

01:02:23.364 --> 01:02:26.742
Just look out the window.
See how fast we're going?

01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:29.995
This train is out of controI.
My God, we can get killed!

01:02:37.503 --> 01:02:40.797
Then we better do something about it!

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:43.675
What about the hostler helper?
A woman.

01:02:43.801 --> 01:02:47.721
Goddamn it! Does she know anything
about running a locomotive?

01:02:47.847 --> 01:02:49.347
Shit.

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:54.561
The only person on the whole train
is a woman. How lucky can I get?

01:03:02.278 --> 01:03:04.654
- Now what?
- It's chief of security from Stonehaven.

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:08.283
- His name's Ranken. Wants to see you.
- I don't have time for him!

01:03:08.409 --> 01:03:11.328
- He says it's important.
- Know anything about the runaway?

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:14.372
- I don't think so.
- Tell him we'll see him later.

01:03:14.499 --> 01:03:17.751
- How far to the bridge? ETA?
- Twenty-five minutes.

01:03:17.877 --> 01:03:19.294
Shit.

01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:25.592
- Seneca Station.
-'Go ahead.'

01:03:25.718 --> 01:03:28.678
This is MacDonald at CentraI ControI.
There's a runaway coming your way.

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:31.348
- It's going over 80.
-'That's too fast for the bridge.'

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:35.060
I know it's too fast.
Have your emergency crew together.

01:03:35.186 --> 01:03:38.396
-'Christ, can't you stop it?'
- We're going to stop it.

01:03:38.523 --> 01:03:40.398
Have them there just in case.

01:03:41.234 --> 01:03:42.818
Asshole.

01:03:55.748 --> 01:03:57.874
It won't do a thing.

01:04:00.044 --> 01:04:02.879
- I tried it from the second engine.
- Why not?

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:06.299
I'm no expert. AII I know is
when engines are hooked together,

01:04:06.425 --> 01:04:08.301
everything operates
from the lead engine.

01:04:08.427 --> 01:04:11.680
Stop the lead engine,
all of them stop.

01:04:14.934 --> 01:04:17.102
I don't believe this shit!

01:04:17.228 --> 01:04:21.898
We get out of a maximum-security prison
and wind up on an unmanned train

01:04:22.024 --> 01:04:24.317
with this bitch and bad news.

01:04:24.443 --> 01:04:27.946
- You guys bust out of Stonehaven?
- Yeah, so what?

01:04:28.072 --> 01:04:32.158
- Man! Why'd you tell her that?
- You told her, clown.

01:04:33.244 --> 01:04:35.704
What difference does it make?
She going to drop a dime on us?

01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:37.998
No.

01:04:38.124 --> 01:04:40.292
I guess you guys
picked the wrong train.

01:04:46.799 --> 01:04:50.677
How come you didn't go up to
the lead engine? Why come back here?

01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:53.513
You can't cross from the second
to the first engine.

01:04:53.639 --> 01:04:56.266
It's a streamliner.
It doesn't have a walkway.

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:59.853
I tried a door in front, but it must
have jammed during the collision.

01:04:59.979 --> 01:05:02.397
Oh, man.

01:05:02.523 --> 01:05:05.609
- What do we do now?
- Think they know about us?

01:05:06.485 --> 01:05:09.112
They do now,
after we hit that caboose.

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:13.450
If they woke up,
there'll be all kinds of pigs

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:16.411
all over this thing
whenever and wherever it stops.

01:05:16.537 --> 01:05:20.290
- Ranken's all over this territory.
- Maybe he'll find us.

01:05:26.714 --> 01:05:30.050
I ain't giving up.
No matter who has to die.

01:05:30.176 --> 01:05:33.094
I ain't giving him that pleasure,
no fucking way!

01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:35.597
I don't want to die.

01:05:35.723 --> 01:05:38.308
I ain't getting caught alive.

01:05:43.064 --> 01:05:45.482
And you neither.

01:05:47.068 --> 01:05:48.860
I don't know, man.

01:05:49.987 --> 01:05:54.366
I don't know nothing right now.
I can't even think straight.

01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:02.916
Just do what I tell you
and don't crap on yourself.

01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:08.505
I let you tag along to be a regular,
not a piece of shit.

01:06:35.908 --> 01:06:38.159
What you're doing ain't nothing.

01:06:38.285 --> 01:06:42.163
We don't stand a chance
if we jump out there.

01:06:42.289 --> 01:06:46.084
I can't jump here.
This is suicide.

01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:49.421
You'll break every bone
in your body and then what?

01:06:50.381 --> 01:06:53.883
- They've been broke before.
- I'm with you.

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:56.261
I'm with you
till the wheels come off.

01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:03.101
- You can't go.
- No?

01:07:03.227 --> 01:07:06.354
- You can't leave me alone here.
- I don't care who jumps with me.

01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:12.193
I know how to stop the train!

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:16.656
Why didn't you tell us that
to start with, goddamn it?

01:07:16.782 --> 01:07:20.285
We probably can't stop it 100%,
but we can slow it down.

01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:22.078
You tell me how.

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:27.042
If we can disconnect the electric
cables between the engines,

01:07:27.168 --> 01:07:29.586
the engines will shut down
one at a time.

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:32.172
It's not going to be easy.

01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:36.342
They'll all be frozen solid
and we don't have the right tools.

01:07:36.469 --> 01:07:38.303
It's a better chance
than jumping out.

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:43.725
You better know
what you're talking about.

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:48.980
Look, don't threaten me.
What's the matter with you?

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.859
Come on. Let's go.

01:08:04.705 --> 01:08:06.414
That one.

01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:08.833
The one next to the tow brake?

01:08:09.543 --> 01:08:11.377
Yeah. Here.

01:08:37.988 --> 01:08:39.781
Take me up!

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:48.747
- You do it. You have two hands.
- OK, hold onto me.

01:08:49.625 --> 01:08:51.126
Use the wrench.

01:09:08.435 --> 01:09:10.478
(Indistinct radio signaI)

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:32.041
Hey, I did it! I got it!

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:35.295
Get me up! I got it!

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:41.926
Frank! Come here, look at this!

01:09:42.051 --> 01:09:44.929
- Look at what?
- The runaway. It slowed down!

01:09:45.973 --> 01:09:50.059
- It's at 80 and still holding.
- It was 92 a couple minutes ago.

01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:53.145
- I don't understand it.
- The girI. Somehow she slowed it.

01:09:53.272 --> 01:09:57.775
It doesn't matter.
Eight, 180, the bridge won't take it.

01:09:57.902 --> 01:10:01.196
- How far to the bridge now?
- (Dave) Five minutes.

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:23.218
- Let's go.
- Right.

01:10:23.344 --> 01:10:26.054
- We can use the fire extinguisher.
- Right.

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:04.384
I lost it!

01:11:07.763 --> 01:11:11.516
She's coming!
ETA's in about three minutes!

01:11:20.025 --> 01:11:21.693
Get me up!

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:26.447
(Screams)

01:11:26.573 --> 01:11:29.284
Manny! Get her, man. Get her!

01:11:31.578 --> 01:11:35.164
I got you! Hold my hand!

01:11:37.001 --> 01:11:39.002
Grab my hand. Come on.

01:11:52.016 --> 01:11:54.642
(Low rumbling)

01:11:58.063 --> 01:12:00.398
(Tracks squeaking)

01:12:09.908 --> 01:12:10.908
Look!

01:12:22.421 --> 01:12:24.964
Manny! Look, Manny, look!

01:12:36.727 --> 01:12:38.561
Get me CentraI ControI. Quick!

01:13:00.417 --> 01:13:01.834
- That's crazy.
- What?

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:04.420
There are three people
on the runaway.

01:13:04.546 --> 01:13:07.131
Holy shit.
Where they come from?

01:13:07.257 --> 01:13:10.676
How do I know?
We just saved three lives.

01:13:10.803 --> 01:13:14.555
- Not for long.
- Dave, give me a fucking break.

01:13:14.681 --> 01:13:18.643
I wish I could, but we got
five minutes to get the runaway

01:13:18.769 --> 01:13:22.397
off the main line, or else it's going
head-on with the Northeast Express.

01:13:22.523 --> 01:13:25.525
No big deaI.
We'll just head her into the 14.

01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:28.361
Great idea. Why don't you
just send her to Elkins?

01:13:28.487 --> 01:13:31.656
- So?
- No, that's the chemicaI plant.

01:13:31.782 --> 01:13:34.492
- She'll never make the curve.
- She'll wipe out the whole plant.

01:13:34.618 --> 01:13:37.203
There'll be toxic chemicals
from here to Kansas.

01:13:37.329 --> 01:13:39.288
Better warn them.

01:14:01.186 --> 01:14:04.689
You know, girI, I oughta thank you.

01:14:04.815 --> 01:14:10.194
It's one thing to jump,
wrap yourself around a tree or a pole.

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:13.322
But to wind up
spilt all over a ditch

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:15.741
with a broken hip,
waiting for the bulls...

01:14:17.077 --> 01:14:18.828
What a waste.

01:14:21.748 --> 01:14:23.875
Yeah, man. You ain't kidding.

01:14:26.211 --> 01:14:30.256
Look, we're almost there.
Come on, Manny.

01:14:30.382 --> 01:14:33.468
- Let's rip this fucker!
- Is that the door?

01:14:33.594 --> 01:14:37.763
- It's jammed. I couldn't open it.
- Don't worry, sweetheart.

01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:40.766
We been breaking through doors
all our lives.

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:50.902
Come on, let me in there.
Let me help.

01:15:01.121 --> 01:15:03.331
- Let me in there.
- I got it!

01:15:03.457 --> 01:15:05.500
(Hammering)

01:15:05.626 --> 01:15:08.628
You can't do it with that hand of yours.

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:17.929
Shit.

01:15:34.112 --> 01:15:38.032
- Take the first west at McKessburg.
- (Dave) Get onto the Bell Port siding.

01:15:38.158 --> 01:15:40.952
Get the emergency crew ready
and evacuate the plant immediately.

01:15:41.078 --> 01:15:43.663
Get them as far away
from the plant as possible.

01:15:43.789 --> 01:15:45.414
You got 10 minutes if you're lucky.
Get off my back, woman!

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:47.750
Get off my back, woman!

01:15:49.253 --> 01:15:53.172
Mr Barstow, I have two very dangerous
prisoners on the loose.

01:15:53.298 --> 01:15:55.841
I don't give a shit
if your whole prison's on the loose.

01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:58.970
I got a killer train on my hands
with three people on board,

01:15:59.096 --> 01:16:01.514
and I got no free tracks
left to play with.

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:05.518
Do me a favour and get lost
or I'll have your ass kicked out of here!

01:16:05.644 --> 01:16:07.979
On the double!

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:13.943
You keep an eye on her.
I'm going to take a leak.

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.671
(Water flushes)

01:16:33.797 --> 01:16:35.881
(Muffled shouts)

01:16:38.385 --> 01:16:40.720
(Coughing and spluttering)

01:16:40.846 --> 01:16:44.140
I hope you don't like it
and want to do something about it.

01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:51.314
I didn't think you wanted
to back up that loud conversation.

01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:01.324
Wipe that piss off your face

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:04.368
and I don't wanna hear
any more crap out of you.

01:17:05.203 --> 01:17:08.914
If I don't get my convicts back,
the prison will be out of controI.

01:17:09.791 --> 01:17:15.171
You know what a riot in a maximum
security prison looks like?

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:24.347
Your brains are too small
to imagine it.

01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:27.725
- Now, where's the train?
- Track one.

01:17:27.851 --> 01:17:30.436
I'm gonna kick your teeth in,
you're playing with me.

01:17:30.562 --> 01:17:32.647
You tell me reaI straight, got it?

01:17:32.773 --> 01:17:34.774
You tell me how to find
that train with a helicopter.

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:37.443
Yeah... I'll show you.

01:18:57.649 --> 01:19:00.526
I'll be goddamned
if I come all this way

01:19:00.652 --> 01:19:03.112
to get stopped
by some goddamned door!

01:19:03.822 --> 01:19:05.740
- Shit!
- Don't give up now.

01:19:05.866 --> 01:19:08.659
- We're gonna make it through this.
- How?

01:19:13.081 --> 01:19:16.083
- I don't know.
- Yeah!

01:19:16.209 --> 01:19:20.296
But I know that people
are clearing the tracks.

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:22.840
And I know they won't abandon us.

01:19:28.305 --> 01:19:32.433
- How do you know that?
- I just feeI it in my heart.

01:19:32.559 --> 01:19:34.769
There are miracles.

01:19:34.895 --> 01:19:38.939
You're stupid. You know how stupid
you sound? Miracle, my ass!

01:19:39.065 --> 01:19:43.235
One must count on oneself,
nobody else.

01:19:43.361 --> 01:19:47.698
You think I'm waiting around
for a miracle to happen?

01:19:47.824 --> 01:19:50.743
I'm going out and around.
Out and around!

01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:53.329
I'm going there.
That's where I'm going!

01:19:55.165 --> 01:19:58.918
You can't make it. I told you,
there's nothing to hold on to.

01:19:59.044 --> 01:20:02.254
There's no walkways.
I told you, you can't make it!

01:20:07.552 --> 01:20:11.639
I'll make it. If I have to fly
the five feet like a birdie...

01:20:11.765 --> 01:20:13.974
I'll fly it. I'll make it.

01:20:16.728 --> 01:20:19.939
Manny, you can't do it.
Not with that arm of yours.

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:23.984
But I can do it.
I can whip this fucker.

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:28.030
So, give me a drink.
Let me go for it.

01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:32.701
- All right.
- Hey, sucker!

01:20:32.828 --> 01:20:34.245
Lighten up.

01:20:40.961 --> 01:20:43.462
- You are so brave.
- Yeah, I know it.

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:50.177
OK. OK.

01:20:50.303 --> 01:20:53.222
Goggles... Yeah, goggles.

01:20:54.266 --> 01:20:57.226
I'm going. Here I go.

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:09.697
Hey, Manny?

01:21:09.823 --> 01:21:12.449
Partners? Yeah.

01:21:16.997 --> 01:21:18.706
Fucking A.

01:21:20.083 --> 01:21:24.378
Fucking A!
OK, OK...

01:21:35.807 --> 01:21:37.474
You can make it!

01:21:37.601 --> 01:21:40.185
You can make it!
Fuck, you got guts, kid!

01:21:46.693 --> 01:21:49.653
You got reaI guts!
More guts than brains.

01:21:49.779 --> 01:21:52.823
- What did you say?
- No brains, no brains!

01:21:52.949 --> 01:21:56.076
- That's mean!
- That's the truth.

01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:07.087
Come on, Buck.
Let's go, sucker.

01:22:30.195 --> 01:22:32.529
Now! Make it now! Jump for it!

01:22:32.656 --> 01:22:34.615
- He's gotta come back.
- Go for it, sucker!

01:22:34.741 --> 01:22:37.826
- I can't watch this.
- Then sit down!

01:22:44.334 --> 01:22:46.168
Don't give up on me!
I ain't letting you quit!

01:22:55.178 --> 01:22:57.429
Come on! Come on!

01:23:02.268 --> 01:23:04.311
Go get the... Ah!

01:23:04.437 --> 01:23:06.897
Don't quit, sucker! Get out there!

01:23:09.859 --> 01:23:12.319
He can't do it!
Don't you care about him?

01:23:12.445 --> 01:23:15.823
- Does his life mean anything to you?
- Get outta here!

01:23:21.454 --> 01:23:23.163
Get back, punk!

01:23:23.289 --> 01:23:26.917
You want to be a tough guy?
You want to be a legend? Go back!

01:23:29.546 --> 01:23:31.046
Let him in!

01:23:37.262 --> 01:23:39.763
- What are you doing, Manny?
- Get the fuck up, sucker!

01:23:39.889 --> 01:23:42.141
Get out there!
Show me you ain't got shit for blood.

01:23:42.267 --> 01:23:45.978
- Give me a break.
- Oh? Get out there!

01:23:47.981 --> 01:23:50.190
Don't you talk to me!

01:23:50.316 --> 01:23:53.485
I don't know who you are.
You wanna be a tough guy?

01:23:53.611 --> 01:23:56.613
Get the fuck outta here!
Get out there!

01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:59.366
- (Sara) No, stop it!
- You wanna kill me or what?

01:23:59.492 --> 01:24:02.411
If I'd wanted to punch your ticket,
you'd be long gone.

01:24:02.537 --> 01:24:05.080
I'm telling you, you can do it!

01:24:05.206 --> 01:24:08.500
I can't do it, Manny. I can't do it.

01:24:08.626 --> 01:24:12.713
You don't know
what you can do, what you can't.

01:24:12.839 --> 01:24:15.883
You're a coward! Why'd I break out
with this chickenshit?

01:24:16.009 --> 01:24:19.219
Leave him alone! No!

01:24:19.345 --> 01:24:21.805
- Get the fuck up! You hear me?
- (Sara) Stop it!

01:24:21.931 --> 01:24:26.060
- Get the fuck up!
- No... No!

01:24:26.186 --> 01:24:29.104
- Get the fuck outta here!
- OK!

01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:31.732
- (Sara) Stop!
- OK...

01:24:31.858 --> 01:24:35.110
- No! No!
- (Buck) OK.

01:24:35.236 --> 01:24:41.617
- OK... OK, I'm going.
- He's using you! Don't go!

01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:43.952
- You're gonna do what I tell you?
- Yeah.

01:24:44.079 --> 01:24:47.498
- That's right! You're gonna do it!
- Do it yourself if you're so brave!

01:24:47.624 --> 01:24:50.209
- I would if I had two hands.
- Bullshit!

01:24:50.335 --> 01:24:54.004
You think you can sacrifice someone
else's life instead of your own?

01:24:54.130 --> 01:24:55.672
You're an animaI!

01:24:57.300 --> 01:25:01.345
No, worse. Human.

01:25:01.471 --> 01:25:02.971
Human!

01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:07.059
Get the fuck out of here.
Go! Get the hell out of here!

01:25:10.230 --> 01:25:12.731
I'm not letting you go! No!

01:25:15.235 --> 01:25:17.152
Don't you touch her!

01:25:24.869 --> 01:25:29.331
- I'll kill you, Manny. I'll kill you.
- You die, sucker! You die!

01:25:29.457 --> 01:25:31.834
I'll kill you, man!
Don't make me kill you.

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:34.211
I'll kill you.

01:25:37.006 --> 01:25:39.842
I'll kill you, man.
Don't make me kill you. I'll kill you.

01:25:42.846 --> 01:25:44.179
(Screams)

01:25:46.683 --> 01:25:50.185
Don't make me kill you.
I'll beat you to fucking death!

01:25:50.311 --> 01:25:53.188
Come on, Manny, try me!
Try me!

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:57.359
(Sara) Kill him!

01:25:57.485 --> 01:25:59.903
Kill him! Kill him!

01:26:00.655 --> 01:26:02.114
Kill him!

01:27:08.681 --> 01:27:11.475
I thought you was my friend.

01:27:13.353 --> 01:27:15.896
I thought we was partners.

01:27:18.483 --> 01:27:20.525
Shit.

01:27:20.652 --> 01:27:24.988
You know, you're worse than Ranken,
when the truth comes out.

01:27:26.532 --> 01:27:28.992
At least he's up front
with his bullshit.

01:27:31.913 --> 01:27:34.206
You was a hero.

01:27:36.834 --> 01:27:39.044
You was a hero

01:27:39.170 --> 01:27:42.923
to all of us
back in that shithole.

01:27:43.049 --> 01:27:44.633
Goddamn.

01:27:47.553 --> 01:27:49.304
Oh, Manny.

01:27:52.976 --> 01:27:54.476
Manny...

01:28:11.411 --> 01:28:15.539
It's your mess, Frank. You should've
listened to me and derailed her.

01:28:15.665 --> 01:28:18.667
So what do we do?
We shunt them onto the siding

01:28:18.793 --> 01:28:21.628
and in 15 minutes
they run out of track and...

01:28:21.754 --> 01:28:24.464
- Elkins Station!
-'Elkins, go ahead.'

01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:27.467
- Gilchrist, this is MacDonald.
-'Yes, MacDonald.'

01:28:28.761 --> 01:28:30.304
- Barstow here.
- Come on!

01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:32.431
Listen carefully and act fast.

01:28:32.557 --> 01:28:35.851
You have about one minute to line
the runaway under the old spur

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:37.602
- the one we don't use anymore.
-'You got it.'

01:28:37.729 --> 01:28:39.646
- All right, go.
- Good, good!

01:28:39.772 --> 01:28:43.358
Good boy! We'll save
the chemicaI plant, huh?

01:28:46.154 --> 01:28:48.739
We're still going to lose
those three people.

01:30:27.547 --> 01:30:29.923
(Indistinct radio signaI)

01:30:33.636 --> 01:30:38.223
(TV reporter)'... successfuI launch
of two communications satellites.

01:30:38.349 --> 01:30:44.479
'The number of sophisticated
experiments will apparently be doubled...'

01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:55.490
I still don't understand.

01:30:55.616 --> 01:30:57.784
How did this happen?

01:30:57.910 --> 01:31:01.329
Why couldn't we stop it
with all this junk?

01:31:02.832 --> 01:31:05.500
I mean,
with all this high technology?

01:31:11.215 --> 01:31:13.925
Some things can't be explained.

01:32:50.565 --> 01:32:52.023
Look!

01:33:27.143 --> 01:33:28.351
(Buck) Holy shit!

01:33:30.855 --> 01:33:32.856
(Laughs)

01:33:35.568 --> 01:33:38.695
See that, Ranken? Did you see that?

01:33:43.117 --> 01:33:45.744
Come on, Ranken! Come on!

01:34:40.549 --> 01:34:42.550
You'll never take me back, Ranken!

01:34:42.677 --> 01:34:46.096
Try it!
You'll never get me alive, sucker!

01:34:46.222 --> 01:34:49.099
What's the matter, Ranken?
You got no fucking guts?

01:34:49.225 --> 01:34:52.435
Come on!
No guts! No guts, Ranken!

01:34:52.561 --> 01:34:56.648
You hear me?
You'll never stop this train, Ranken!

01:34:56.774 --> 01:34:59.484
You'll never stop it!
You hear me, sucker?

01:34:59.610 --> 01:35:02.320
I told you! You hear, Ranken?

01:35:02.446 --> 01:35:04.656
I told you I'd break free!
I've done it!

01:35:04.782 --> 01:35:08.576
Here I am, right in your face, sucker!
Come on down!

01:35:08.703 --> 01:35:10.662
I won! I won!

01:35:12.039 --> 01:35:14.290
I want you down, Ranken!
Come on down!

01:35:14.417 --> 01:35:16.835
Come on down, here I am!
I'm alive, sucker!

01:35:16.961 --> 01:35:19.421
Come on down, Ranken!

01:35:21.799 --> 01:35:23.883
Ranken, you hear me?

01:35:24.009 --> 01:35:26.344
You hear me, Ranken?
You'll never get me!

01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:30.682
You'll never stop this train. Never!
Never! You understand? I won!

01:35:30.808 --> 01:35:33.935
I won! I won!

01:36:01.338 --> 01:36:03.506
(Screeching)

01:36:05.843 --> 01:36:07.594
What was that?

01:36:09.096 --> 01:36:11.181
Huh?

01:36:11.307 --> 01:36:15.435
- What happened? What happened?
- They gave up on us.

01:36:15.561 --> 01:36:18.563
They switched us off the main track
onto a dead-end.

01:36:18.689 --> 01:36:21.983
- What does that mean?
- We're going to crash any minute.

01:36:24.278 --> 01:36:25.862
A- ha...

01:36:48.969 --> 01:36:50.595
Hold me.

01:36:52.973 --> 01:36:55.225
I don't want to die alone.

01:36:57.061 --> 01:37:00.146
We're going to be all right.
We going to be fine.

01:37:00.272 --> 01:37:03.024
Huh! We all die alone.
Come on, Ranken!

01:37:03.150 --> 01:37:08.029
Come on, sucker! Here I am!
I'm out of my cage now!

01:37:08.155 --> 01:37:13.159
I'm out, out of my cage!
I'm never going back. Never!

01:37:13.285 --> 01:37:16.371
You'll never stop me!
Never! I'm out, you hear me?

01:37:16.497 --> 01:37:19.082
You can't get across, Manny.

01:37:19.208 --> 01:37:22.293
I'm out of my cage.
You'll never stop me.

01:37:27.925 --> 01:37:30.593
You're gonna learn, kid.

01:37:30.719 --> 01:37:32.720
It's all up here.

01:37:34.056 --> 01:37:36.140
I'll cross the stinking thing.

01:37:37.309 --> 01:37:39.978
I'll cross it! I'll cross it!

01:37:41.230 --> 01:37:42.689
Watch me.

01:38:52.051 --> 01:38:54.093
(Agonised screams)

01:40:25.811 --> 01:40:28.229
(Gasping)

01:40:28.355 --> 01:40:30.273
Waiting for you.

01:40:59.303 --> 01:41:02.680
You and me, sucker!
Just you and me!

01:41:13.650 --> 01:41:15.943
Is Jonah alive?

01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:18.362
Is Jonah alive?

01:41:18.489 --> 01:41:20.698
Yes... Yes!

01:41:25.162 --> 01:41:29.499
That's good. He'll be glad.

01:41:50.729 --> 01:41:54.857
Don't do it, Manny.
You'll burn for it. You know you will.

01:41:58.403 --> 01:42:01.781
Push the button.
We're on a dead-end siding.

01:42:01.907 --> 01:42:04.534
We're gonna crash
in five minutes.

01:42:09.414 --> 01:42:12.750
Then we'll have a nice
five-minute ride together.

01:42:20.134 --> 01:42:24.595
You think you're a hero, huh?
You're scum.

01:42:26.014 --> 01:42:28.057
We're both scum, brother.

01:42:58.213 --> 01:43:02.216
You're going to push that button
and stop this train!

01:43:02.342 --> 01:43:04.343
We've only got a few minutes!

01:43:05.095 --> 01:43:07.513
We got all the time in the world.

01:43:08.473 --> 01:43:12.101
- You'll die, bastard!
- You'll die with me.

01:43:16.148 --> 01:43:21.485
Fuck you. You're as afraid to die
as anybody else.

01:43:21.612 --> 01:43:25.114
And I never let you free.
You hear me?

01:43:27.075 --> 01:43:29.327
I am free, Ranken.

01:43:30.412 --> 01:43:31.996
I am free.

01:43:34.416 --> 01:43:36.542
You think you won!

01:43:39.296 --> 01:43:41.297
I know how to die too!

01:43:43.217 --> 01:43:46.844
Win, lose,
what's the difference?

01:43:54.269 --> 01:43:56.312
What about that punk and the girI?

01:44:04.196 --> 01:44:05.821
No, no...

01:44:05.948 --> 01:44:08.199
It's just you and me.

01:45:08.093 --> 01:45:12.263
Manny! Shut it down.
Manny, goddamn it!

01:45:12.389 --> 01:45:15.308
Shut it down, Manny!

01:45:15.434 --> 01:45:18.686
Shut it down!
That's all you got to do, Manny!

01:45:18.812 --> 01:45:21.230
He knows what he wants to do.

01:45:21.356 --> 01:45:26.902
(Buck) Manny, Shut it down!
That's all you got to do, Manny...

01:45:31.366 --> 01:45:33.451
Shut it down, goddamn it!

01:45:33.577 --> 01:45:35.995
That's all you got to do, Manny!

01:45:49.509 --> 01:45:51.135
He did it.

01:45:52.471 --> 01:45:54.096
He did it.
