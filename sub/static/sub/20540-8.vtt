[cheers and applause]

00:40.367 --> 00:43.600
- Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

00:43.600 --> 00:44.633
I'm John Oliver.

00:44.633 --> 00:46.500
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.433
Just time for a quick recap
of the week,

00:48.433 --> 00:50.600
and it has been
frantically busy.

00:50.600 --> 00:52.467
The Senate triggered
the nuclear option

00:52.467 --> 00:54.400
to put Neil Gorsuch
onto the Supreme Court

00:54.400 --> 00:57.600
and, therefore, a lobster
onto our all-dog court.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.734
Devin Nunes recused himself

00:59.734 --> 01:01.633
from the House investigation
of Trump's Russia Ties

01:01.633 --> 01:04.633
after he himself came under
an ethics investigation.

01:04.633 --> 01:07.100
A classic Devin move.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.133
And of course, on Thursday,

01:09.133 --> 01:11.633
there was
the biggest news of all.

01:11.633 --> 01:12.867
- We are coming on the air
right now

01:12.867 --> 01:14.533
because President Trump
has just ordered

01:14.533 --> 01:16.166
a military strike on Syria.

01:16.166 --> 01:18.133
- On President Trump's orders,
U.S. warships

01:18.133 --> 01:21.533
launched between 50 and 60
Tomahawk cruise missiles

01:21.533 --> 01:23.834
targeting a Syrian
government air base.

01:23.834 --> 01:26.066
- Yes, a Syrian airfield
this week

01:26.066 --> 01:27.800
was bombed by President Trump,

01:27.800 --> 01:29.900
two words that when placed
in a sentence like that

01:29.900 --> 01:32.900
are as downright unsettling
as ham smoothie

01:32.900 --> 01:35.633
or placenta kimono.

01:35.633 --> 01:38.633
And before we get into
what we did and why we did it,

01:38.633 --> 01:40.533
it is worth taking
a moment to acknowledge

01:40.533 --> 01:43.066
some of the reactions
to the airstrikes themselves,

01:43.066 --> 01:44.834
particularly within the media,

01:44.834 --> 01:47.867
which occasionally
bordered on the orgasmic.

01:47.867 --> 01:51.066
- We see these beautiful
pictures at night

01:51.066 --> 01:54.633
from the decks of these two
U.S. Navy vessels

01:54.633 --> 01:56.867
in the Eastern Mediterranean.

01:56.867 --> 01:59.967
I am tempted to quote
the great Leonard Cohen,

01:59.967 --> 02:03.700
"I'm guided by the beauty
of our weapons."

02:03.700 --> 02:08.100
And they are beautiful
pictures of fearsome armaments.

02:08.100 --> 02:10.500
- What are you talking about?

02:10.500 --> 02:11.967
It's a little ironic

02:11.967 --> 02:14.633
to see Brian Williams
on MSNBC talking about

02:14.633 --> 02:16.100
"the beauty of our weapons,"

02:16.100 --> 02:18.367
because that is
not a phrase anyone would use

02:18.367 --> 02:21.400
if they had, for instance,
ever been in a helicopter

02:21.400 --> 02:23.800
that was hit by ground fire.

02:23.800 --> 02:26.533
And he wasn't even done talking

02:26.533 --> 02:29.066
about whatever the fuck
he was talking about.

02:29.066 --> 02:30.900
- Because life imitates art,

02:30.900 --> 02:33.934
there's a scene in
"The American President"

02:33.934 --> 02:36.700
where Michael Douglas,
playing the fictional president,

02:36.700 --> 02:41.300
is being told that an airstrike
against a radar installation

02:41.300 --> 02:43.900
is proportional
and it's presidential,

02:43.900 --> 02:46.367
and he chooses
to think about the guy

02:46.367 --> 02:48.066
who's coming
on the night shift

02:48.066 --> 02:49.767
as part of a cleaning crew

02:49.767 --> 02:51.533
and how he's
gonna lose his life

02:51.533 --> 02:53.900
in this presidential
airstrike.

02:53.900 --> 02:57.066
Well, the same thing
happened tonight, obviously.

02:57.066 --> 02:59.233
- No, it didn't.

02:59.233 --> 03:00.900
Because first,
this is not a song.

03:00.900 --> 03:02.166
It's not a movie.

03:02.166 --> 03:04.800
We fired real missiles
at an actual country.

03:04.800 --> 03:07.000
And also,
there is nothing obvious

03:07.000 --> 03:09.934
about Trump expressing concern
for another human being.

03:09.934 --> 03:11.967
I am pretty sure the only time

03:11.967 --> 03:14.200
he's ever thought about
a cleaning crew has been to say,

03:14.200 --> 03:15.934
"There's a fingerprint
on this vase.

03:15.934 --> 03:18.433
Don't pay them this week."

03:18.433 --> 03:20.700
But it wasn't just
the media who were excited.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.266
Some of Trump's biggest critics
had praise for the strikes,

03:23.266 --> 03:25.166
with John McCain
and Lindsey Graham saying

03:25.166 --> 03:28.000
Trump deserves the support
of the American people,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.967
and Chuck Schumer saying
it was the right thing to do.

03:30.967 --> 03:32.333
While interestingly,

03:32.333 --> 03:34.400
some of Trump's
most prominent supporters

03:34.400 --> 03:36.033
were significantly less happy,

03:36.033 --> 03:37.600
including Alex Jones,

03:37.600 --> 03:40.567
who even tried to weave
a conspiracy around it.

03:40.567 --> 03:45.734
- So paradoxically,
Trump is really disintegrating,

03:45.734 --> 03:48.333
in my eyes, on many levels.

03:48.333 --> 03:51.133
But paradoxically,
he's doing so much good

03:51.133 --> 03:53.834
that I realize they're
maneuvering him into bad

03:53.834 --> 03:55.767
so they won't call him
a Russian agent,

03:55.767 --> 03:57.500
so he can look tough
to the Russians,

03:57.500 --> 03:59.500
so he can look tough
to the Chinese,

03:59.500 --> 04:01.333
and so he can shut down
his critics.

04:01.333 --> 04:02.600
But once you feed the pirate,

04:02.600 --> 04:04.967
they're going to want
more, more, more.

04:04.967 --> 04:06.333
- Wait.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.033
"Once you feed the pirate,
they're gonna want more"?

04:09.033 --> 04:13.133
Not only is all of that crazy,
that is not even a phrase.

04:13.133 --> 04:15.700
Oh, I'm against these strikes,
'cause you know what they say,

04:15.700 --> 04:17.000
"If you want to skin a ferret,

04:17.000 --> 04:18.800
you better bring
your dancin' shoes."

04:18.800 --> 04:20.033
And I mean it!

04:20.033 --> 04:23.033
"Once you start washing
an alligator, paradoxically,

04:23.033 --> 04:26.066
you don't stop till it's dry."

04:26.066 --> 04:28.433
But there are
some serious questions

04:28.433 --> 04:30.700
that need to be answered
regarding these airstrikes,

04:30.700 --> 04:32.100
which were in retaliation

04:32.100 --> 04:34.000
against Syrian dictator
Bashar al-Assad's

04:34.000 --> 04:36.633
apparent use of chemical weapons
to target his own people,

04:36.633 --> 04:38.767
which is undeniably horrific.

04:38.767 --> 04:40.400
But as many have noted,

04:40.400 --> 04:42.767
when Assad did
the same thing four years ago,

04:42.767 --> 04:45.767
Trump's response was
significantly different.

04:45.767 --> 04:49.300
- The attack also a startling
about-face for President Trump,

04:49.300 --> 04:51.500
who has repeatedly
argued against

04:51.500 --> 04:53.300
military intervention
in Syria.

04:53.300 --> 04:57.200
- Why do we care?
Let ISIS and Syria fight.

04:57.200 --> 05:00.800
And let Russia--
they're in Syria already.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.567
- Mm-hmm.
- Let them fight ISIS.

05:02.567 --> 05:05.533
- Tweeting repeatedly after
the last major chemical attack

05:05.533 --> 05:07.066
in Syria four years ago

05:07.066 --> 05:10.233
that the United States should
stay out of the conflict.

05:10.233 --> 05:12.767
- Is there anything
Trump is doing now

05:12.767 --> 05:16.200
where he didn't at one point
tweet about doing the opposite?

05:16.200 --> 05:18.000
I honestly
would not be surprised

05:18.000 --> 05:19.767
if in 2011 he tweeted,

05:19.767 --> 05:22.233
"Only a stupid idiot
would live in a big white house

05:22.233 --> 05:23.567
"and sign bills into law.

05:23.567 --> 05:25.900
#SAD."

05:25.900 --> 05:27.934
Now, administration
officials have said

05:27.934 --> 05:29.400
that it was
the gruesome images

05:29.400 --> 05:31.867
of the chemical weapons attack
that changed Trump's mind,

05:31.867 --> 05:34.934
which, on one level,
is absolutely understandable.

05:34.934 --> 05:36.867
The images
were truly horrifying.

05:36.867 --> 05:40.100
Just as, again,
they were four years ago.

05:40.100 --> 05:41.400
But while it is natural

05:41.400 --> 05:43.333
to want to take
some kind of action in response,

05:43.333 --> 05:46.333
it has to come in the context
of a larger strategy,

05:46.333 --> 05:48.233
or it's close to worthless.

05:48.233 --> 05:49.934
Because though the strikes
seem to have made

05:49.934 --> 05:54.033
certain people feel better,
what did they actually achieve?

05:54.033 --> 05:56.066
- Does this change the facts
on the ground at all, Martha?

05:56.066 --> 05:57.567
- I don't think
it really does.

05:57.567 --> 05:59.934
I mean, this wasn't
a strategic strike

05:59.934 --> 06:02.400
and hurting Assad
going forward.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.033
It's this one airfield.

06:04.033 --> 06:05.800
It is a punishing air strike.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.133
It took out aircraft.

06:07.133 --> 06:08.700
They took out fuel supplies.

06:08.700 --> 06:12.100
They took out some of the
surrounding infrastructure.

06:12.100 --> 06:14.166
But he has
many other airfields.

06:14.166 --> 06:15.433
- It's true.

06:15.433 --> 06:17.533
In fact, he apparently still
has the one we bombed,

06:17.533 --> 06:19.734
because Syrian warplanes were
carrying out attacks from it

06:19.734 --> 06:22.033
just hours
after our missile strike.

06:22.033 --> 06:24.367
And that is hardly
a crippling blow.

06:24.367 --> 06:27.033
Delta passengers experience
longer flight delays

06:27.033 --> 06:29.400
on a daily basis.

06:29.400 --> 06:32.333
Look, maybe
a symbolic airstrike

06:32.333 --> 06:34.233
was strategically
the best move for Trump,

06:34.233 --> 06:37.100
but I don't think
he's thinking strategically.

06:37.100 --> 06:39.433
Because there is no indication
that he's taken the time

06:39.433 --> 06:41.567
to answer
some fairly basic questions.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.667
Like if this was
a warning shot,

06:43.667 --> 06:45.433
what are we warning against?

06:45.433 --> 06:48.533
Do we only want to stop Assad
using chemical weapons

06:48.533 --> 06:50.667
or are we going to push
for regime change?

06:50.667 --> 06:52.033
If he does it again,

06:52.033 --> 06:53.834
are we prepared
to go to war to stop him?

06:53.834 --> 06:55.934
If so, are we prepared
for how significantly

06:55.934 --> 06:58.166
this may deteriorate
our relationship with Russia?

06:58.166 --> 07:00.967
And how will that affect
our fight against ISIS?

07:00.967 --> 07:02.900
This is complicated.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.800
And I am not saying
there are right answers here.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.200
I'm saying there needs to be
a tangible strategy

07:08.200 --> 07:10.734
acknowledging how difficult
taking on Assad actually is.

07:10.734 --> 07:12.834
Because right now
we have a president

07:12.834 --> 07:14.467
who feeds off praise,

07:14.467 --> 07:17.834
and he just got a lot of it
for bombing someone,

07:17.834 --> 07:21.033
and that should make everyone
very, very worried.

07:21.033 --> 07:24.867
Or to put this in terms that
Brian Williams can understand.

07:24.867 --> 07:28.033
There's a scene in the movie
"American Pie"

07:28.033 --> 07:29.800
where the character Jim,

07:29.800 --> 07:32.266
played by Jason Biggs,
has sex with a pie

07:32.266 --> 07:35.100
because he wants to feel
like a big strong grownup man.

07:35.100 --> 07:36.433
Well, the concern is

07:36.433 --> 07:38.834
that if we blindly let him
continue down this path,

07:38.834 --> 07:42.066
Donald Trump could become
that horny teenager,

07:42.066 --> 07:45.700
and the whole world
could become that pie.

07:45.700 --> 07:48.133
So for now,
let's move on--

07:48.133 --> 07:52.000
[cheers and applause]
let's move on to Fox News,

07:52.000 --> 07:54.266
a series of Cialis
and catheter commercials

07:54.266 --> 07:57.567
occasionally interrupted
by an episode of "The Five."

07:57.567 --> 07:59.000
Fox News has been rocked

07:59.000 --> 08:00.767
by sexual harassment
scandals recently,

08:00.767 --> 08:03.967
and this week brought
one of the most damaging yet.

08:03.967 --> 08:06.000
- This morning,
new revelations

08:06.000 --> 08:07.700
about sexual
harassment claims

08:07.700 --> 08:10.967
at Fox News aimed at
the network's biggest star.

08:10.967 --> 08:13.800
"The New York Times" finding
Fox News and Bill O'Reilly

08:13.800 --> 08:17.834
paid five women
a total of almost $13 million

08:17.834 --> 08:21.367
in settlements
going back 15 years.

08:21.367 --> 08:24.300
- Yes, Bill O'Reilly,
who scientists hypothesize

08:24.300 --> 08:27.100
is kind of a dense nebula
of boner and racism,

08:27.100 --> 08:29.300
has been paying out settlements

08:29.300 --> 08:31.200
for alleged harassment
for years,

08:31.200 --> 08:33.333
and the details
are pretty disturbing here,

08:33.333 --> 08:35.567
with the victims claiming
things like verbal abuse,

08:35.567 --> 08:37.967
lewd comments,
unwanted advances

08:37.967 --> 08:40.934
and phone calls in which
it sounded as if Mr. O'Reilly

08:40.934 --> 08:42.400
was masturbating.

08:42.400 --> 08:47.000
And I hate to ask this,
but what does that sound like?

08:47.000 --> 08:49.233
Does it sound like
a dog's jowls flapping

08:49.233 --> 08:52.400
when it sticks its head out
of the window of a moving car?

08:52.400 --> 08:56.033
Or someone frantically stirring
a bowl of cake batter?

08:56.033 --> 08:58.233
Or was it more a subtle
"tap, tap, tap"

08:58.233 --> 09:00.667
like a mouse giving
a round of applause?

09:00.667 --> 09:04.100
I mean, either way,
it's horrible.

09:04.100 --> 09:06.300
And look, it's not just
those five women.

09:06.300 --> 09:09.400
Dr. Wendy Walsh, an occasional
guest on O'Reilly's show,

09:09.400 --> 09:11.834
came forward this week,
claiming he took her to dinner,

09:11.834 --> 09:13.834
ostensibly to offer her
career advice,

09:13.834 --> 09:15.934
but when she declined
to come back to his room,

09:15.934 --> 09:18.667
his tone noticeably changed.

09:18.667 --> 09:20.600
- He told me,
he complained about the--

09:20.600 --> 09:22.367
I had ordered a soda water,

09:22.367 --> 09:24.433
and he complained about the cost
of the soda water and said,

09:24.433 --> 09:26.533
"I wonder what they're charging
for a cup of water here."

09:26.533 --> 09:28.066
He told me my bag was ugly.

09:28.066 --> 09:30.433
He goes, "That's the ugliest bag
I've ever seen.

09:30.433 --> 09:33.000
- Okay, okay, hold on.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.867
She's saying
when he got rejected,

09:34.867 --> 09:36.467
he started negging her

09:36.467 --> 09:38.400
by complaining
about the price of seltzer

09:38.400 --> 09:40.633
and then criticizing
her fashion choices.

09:40.633 --> 09:42.600
Apparently,
in Bill O'Reilly's mind,

09:42.600 --> 09:45.233
every woman wants to fuck
her own mother.

09:45.233 --> 09:47.200
Now--now it is--

09:47.200 --> 09:51.400
it is hard for us, any of us,
to imagine what it must be like

09:51.400 --> 09:54.734
to be on the receiving end of
dirty talk from Bill O'Reilly,

09:54.734 --> 09:57.633
but it's not, as it turns out,
impossible.

09:57.633 --> 10:01.166
Because in 1998 he wrote a book
called "Those Who Trespass,"

10:01.166 --> 10:03.066
featuring numerous sex scenes,

10:03.066 --> 10:05.333
and he narrated
his own audiobook.

10:05.333 --> 10:08.700
And yes, we're doing this.

10:08.700 --> 10:11.400
Here's a sample.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.834
Hot.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.200
That--that is a man

10:36.200 --> 10:37.934
describing a woman's orgasm

10:37.934 --> 10:40.867
who has clearly
never seen a woman's orgasm.

10:40.867 --> 10:42.533
And just on technical note,

10:42.533 --> 10:45.133
you can't knead skin
with your tongue, Bill.

10:45.133 --> 10:46.633
You've confused making love

10:46.633 --> 10:49.066
with making
a rustic sourdough bread.

10:49.066 --> 10:51.266
But wait, wait,
'cause we haven't even got

10:51.266 --> 10:53.800
to the most
stomach-churning part yet.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.400
I am willing to bet
that there has never been

11:10.400 --> 11:13.567
a fictional character
more happy to not actually exist

11:13.567 --> 11:15.834
than Ashley Van Buren.

11:15.834 --> 11:17.767
And yet--and yet, so far,

11:17.767 --> 11:20.533
Fox News is firmly
standing by their man

11:20.533 --> 11:23.400
and is citing
some pretty weak reasoning.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.233
- Fox's parent company
points out,

11:25.233 --> 11:27.934
"No current or former
Fox News employee

11:27.934 --> 11:31.300
"ever took advantage of
the 21st century Fox hotline

11:31.300 --> 11:33.834
to raise a concern
about Bill O'Reilly."

11:33.834 --> 11:36.467
- So their defense is,
he can't be guilty,

11:36.467 --> 11:38.800
because no one called H.R.
to complain.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.300
But why would they?

11:40.300 --> 11:42.867
I've always assumed that
Fox News's H.R. department

11:42.867 --> 11:44.700
is just a telephone
in an empty room

11:44.700 --> 11:47.567
being manned by a horny goat.

11:47.567 --> 11:49.700
Now--now, O'Reilly
denies the claims,

11:49.700 --> 11:51.934
accusing these women
of just wanting money,

11:51.934 --> 11:54.667
but Wendy Walsh
isn't even asking for money.

11:54.667 --> 11:56.233
She just thinks
everyone could learn

11:56.233 --> 11:58.500
a valuable lesson from this.

11:58.500 --> 12:01.767
- All men need to learn
that a workplace

12:01.767 --> 12:04.100
is not a mating marketplace.

12:04.100 --> 12:06.300
And Bill O'Reilly,
like the rest of us,

12:06.300 --> 12:08.033
needs to just use Tinder.

12:08.033 --> 12:12.433
- No, no, he absolutely
does not need to do that.

12:12.433 --> 12:15.133
That would be terrible
for literally everyone,

12:15.133 --> 12:16.734
except Bumble,

12:16.734 --> 12:20.900
because they would have
a rock-solid new ad campaign.

12:20.900 --> 12:24.667
That's going to hit hard
and hit well.

12:24.667 --> 12:28.934
And look, whether O'Reilly is
learning his lesson here or not,

12:28.934 --> 12:32.533
his advertisers are
not hanging around to find out.

12:32.533 --> 12:34.433
- We have seen dozens
of advertisers--

12:34.433 --> 12:36.834
our latest count
is around 60 advertisers--

12:36.834 --> 12:39.266
go ahead and say
we're not gonna run our ads

12:39.266 --> 12:41.367
on "The O'Reilly Factor"
anymore.

12:41.367 --> 12:43.834
- Well, that is not good
for Bill O'Reilly,

12:43.834 --> 12:45.367
and I would
that say he should call

12:45.367 --> 12:46.800
his advertisers to apologize,

12:46.800 --> 12:48.900
but the problem is,
he might just start jerking off

12:48.900 --> 12:50.600
while they're on the phone.

12:50.600 --> 12:51.834
Tap, tap, tap.

12:51.834 --> 12:54.133
Tap, tap, tap.

12:54.133 --> 12:56.467
Tap, tap, tap.

12:56.467 --> 12:59.367
Almost nobody is
standing by Bill O'Reilly.

12:59.367 --> 13:00.600
Nobody, that is,

13:00.600 --> 13:03.600
apart from the President
of the United States.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.133
- I think he's a person
I know well.

13:06.133 --> 13:08.066
- Yeah.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.533
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

13:21.934 --> 13:23.900
- Nobody gets to be
surprised by that,

13:23.900 --> 13:26.567
because it is entirely
plausible that the hill

13:26.567 --> 13:28.467
our president
is willing to die on

13:28.467 --> 13:31.633
is the one formed by Bill
O'Reilly's workplace erection

13:31.633 --> 13:34.367
poking up against
his old-man slacks.

13:34.367 --> 13:36.834
So to recap this story for you.

13:36.834 --> 13:39.166
Bill O'Reilly
needs advertisers,

13:39.166 --> 13:42.033
and Donald Trump needs to
understand sexual harassment.

13:42.033 --> 13:44.233
And here is where we come in.

13:44.233 --> 13:45.967
Because as you may remember,

13:45.967 --> 13:48.233
our Catheter Cowboy
has spent this year

13:48.233 --> 13:50.433
appearing in ads
on Fox News,

13:50.433 --> 13:52.667
explaining everything
from the nuclear triad

13:52.667 --> 13:54.333
to the American
Health Care Act.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.266
And I think you know
where this is going.

13:57.266 --> 13:59.934
We have produced an ad
to educate Donald Trump,

13:59.934 --> 14:03.400
to air during the "O'Reilly
Factor" in New York and D.C.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.600
We submitted it
to stations on Friday

14:05.600 --> 14:08.266
but weirdly we haven't
heard back from them since,

14:08.266 --> 14:09.734
which is a little surprising,

14:09.734 --> 14:13.033
because we're one of the only
advertisers offering to buy time

14:13.033 --> 14:14.633
on his show at the moment.

14:14.633 --> 14:16.667
And I do hope
they don't reject this ad,

14:16.667 --> 14:19.433
but just in case they do,
here's a sneak peek

14:19.433 --> 14:22.033
of what we would like
the president to see.

14:23.834 --> 14:25.700
- Howdy again.
I am a professional cowboy.

14:25.700 --> 14:28.166
I use catheters,
and there's two things I know.

14:28.166 --> 14:30.066
I don't like pain when I cath,

14:30.066 --> 14:33.667
and repeated unwanted sexual
advances or obscene remarks

14:33.667 --> 14:36.266
in the workplace
constitute sexual harassment.

14:36.266 --> 14:38.633
If there is a power disparity
between the two parties,

14:38.633 --> 14:40.367
well, that's about
as inappropriate

14:40.367 --> 14:43.166
as lubricating a catheter
with hot sauce, partner.

14:43.166 --> 14:44.600
Why would you do that?

14:44.600 --> 14:47.100
I don't like pain when I cath.

14:47.100 --> 14:48.800
And if you've got a friend
who was accused

14:48.800 --> 14:50.767
of something like that
over and over again,

14:50.767 --> 14:53.000
I might think twice
about defending him.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.734
'Cause that contributes
to a culture

14:54.734 --> 14:56.667
where women don't want
to come forward,

14:56.667 --> 14:59.266
and I know you might not
care about that.

14:59.266 --> 15:02.734
But on some level, you've got
to know you are blowing this.

15:02.734 --> 15:05.834
You're sacrificing the chance
to make society a better place

15:05.834 --> 15:10.367
on the altar of your towering
ignorance and fragile ego.

15:10.367 --> 15:13.934
You are blowing this.

15:13.934 --> 15:15.433
That's all for now.

15:15.433 --> 15:17.433
Good-bye,
everyone watching this,

15:17.433 --> 15:19.800
and definitely
not one specific person.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.467
See you next time.

15:21.467 --> 15:23.533
[cheers and applause]

15:23.533 --> 15:25.500
- Moving on.

15:25.500 --> 15:28.467
Our main story tonight
concerns democracy.

15:28.467 --> 15:30.467
Undeniably,
the best Greek export

15:30.467 --> 15:32.667
that doesn't have
fruit at the bottom.

15:32.667 --> 15:35.133
Now, there is understandable
concern at the moment

15:35.133 --> 15:37.300
about the personalities
harming our democracy,

15:37.300 --> 15:38.500
but tonight,
let's talk about

15:38.500 --> 15:40.500
one of the major structural
problems.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.367
And it's something Democrats
in particular

15:42.367 --> 15:44.266
love to complain about.

15:44.266 --> 15:45.900
- We have seen Republicans

15:45.900 --> 15:48.500
rig the system
with their gerrymandering,

15:48.500 --> 15:50.600
often illegal gerrymandering.

15:50.600 --> 15:53.400
- There is gerrymandering
to a fare-thee-well in states

15:53.400 --> 15:55.333
controlled
by the Republicans.

15:55.333 --> 15:57.266
- Listen, political
gerrymandering is probably

15:57.266 --> 16:00.166
one of the greatest threats
to our democracy right now.

16:00.166 --> 16:02.000
- Well, slow down.
That is a bit much.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.633
The greatest threat to our
democracy right now is clearly

16:04.633 --> 16:06.367
whatever tweet
the president has planned

16:06.367 --> 16:08.266
for Cinco de Mayo this year.

16:08.266 --> 16:10.300
We don't know what it'll be.

16:10.300 --> 16:12.900
We don't know which Spanish
words will be misspelled,

16:12.900 --> 16:16.266
but we can assume
it will be horrifying.

16:16.266 --> 16:18.600
But gerrymandering
is a real problem.

16:18.600 --> 16:21.700
It's the practice of drawing
voting districts in a way

16:21.700 --> 16:23.200
that creates unfair advantages

16:23.200 --> 16:25.033
for whoever happens
to be drawing the lines.

16:25.033 --> 16:27.100
Which it does sound mundane,

16:27.100 --> 16:28.934
but the results
can be significant.

16:28.934 --> 16:31.000
Gerrymandering is partly
responsible for giving

16:31.000 --> 16:34.266
Republicans such an edge
in the House of Representatives.

16:34.266 --> 16:36.834
Because take a look at
what happened in some states

16:36.834 --> 16:38.767
where they drew
the district lines.

16:38.767 --> 16:41.066
- In Pennsylvania,
44% of the voters

16:41.066 --> 16:42.467
chose democratic candidates

16:42.467 --> 16:45.500
for the House of
Representatives in 2014.

16:45.500 --> 16:48.667
But 13 of the 18 districts,
more than two-thirds,

16:48.667 --> 16:50.867
are represented
by Republicans.

16:50.867 --> 16:54.467
In Ohio, about 40% of the voters
chose Democratic candidates

16:54.467 --> 16:56.100
for the House
of Representatives.

16:56.100 --> 16:59.400
But 12 out of 16 seats,
three-quarters of them,

16:59.400 --> 17:01.433
are represented by
Republicans.

17:01.433 --> 17:04.100
- Those numbers
are way out of proportion

17:04.100 --> 17:05.734
to what people should expect.

17:05.734 --> 17:07.700
You wouldn't accept
Neapolitan ice cream

17:07.700 --> 17:10.100
that was 75% strawberry.

17:10.100 --> 17:11.633
How is that okay?

17:11.633 --> 17:14.834
What perverts voted for this?

17:14.834 --> 17:17.800
So whoever draws the districts
has a lot of power.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.767
And thanks to
technological advances,

17:19.767 --> 17:23.467
it's possible to use that power
in very precise ways.

17:23.467 --> 17:25.266
- In the age of computers,

17:25.266 --> 17:28.266
you can gerrymander
with scientific precision.

17:28.266 --> 17:30.967
You can run in and out of alleys
and up and down streets,

17:30.967 --> 17:34.433
so carefully include and exclude
whichever voters you want

17:34.433 --> 17:36.400
in one district
and not in another,

17:36.400 --> 17:38.567
so it's become
a very precise science.

17:38.567 --> 17:39.767
- He's right about that.

17:39.767 --> 17:42.100
Gerrymandering has become
a very precise science.

17:42.100 --> 17:43.467
And interestingly,

17:43.467 --> 17:45.166
it's one of the few
remaining types of science

17:45.166 --> 17:47.600
in which the Republican
party currently believes.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.834
Now--now, there are
different reasons

17:49.834 --> 17:52.000
politicians engage
in gerrymandering.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.667
It's done
to disadvantage voters

17:53.667 --> 17:56.266
based on race
or on political party

17:56.266 --> 17:58.533
or to shore up seats
for incumbents,

17:58.533 --> 18:00.667
sometimes even
within a party.

18:00.667 --> 18:02.333
Take Hakeem Jeffries.

18:02.333 --> 18:04.500
In 2000, he ran
a strong challenge

18:04.500 --> 18:07.166
in a Democratic primary for
the New York State Assembly.

18:07.166 --> 18:09.767
And he planned
to run again in 2002,

18:09.767 --> 18:12.033
but the Democrats had done
something interesting

18:12.033 --> 18:13.433
to the map.

18:13.433 --> 18:17.367
- The map that was drawn
was absolutely fascinating.

18:17.367 --> 18:22.200
They drew a map that literally
carved out the block

18:22.200 --> 18:27.333
on which Hakeem Jeffries
lived from Assembly District 57.

18:27.333 --> 18:30.033
- I remember shaking my head
in disbelief.

18:30.033 --> 18:32.800
There were a lot of people
hoping to vote for me

18:32.800 --> 18:34.533
but were surprised to find

18:34.533 --> 18:36.633
that they no longer lived
in the assembly district

18:36.633 --> 18:39.867
that they had been
living in for years,

18:39.867 --> 18:41.367
if not decades.

18:41.367 --> 18:45.867
Brooklyn politics
can be pretty rough,

18:45.867 --> 18:47.567
but that move was gangster.

18:47.567 --> 18:50.667
- Yeah, it was gangster.

18:50.667 --> 18:53.734
And remember, the threshold
for "gangster" in Brooklyn

18:53.734 --> 18:57.333
is the Notorious B.I.G.,
whose debut album

18:57.333 --> 18:58.900
begins with songs that are,
respectively,

18:58.900 --> 19:00.967
about armed robbery,
gun violence,

19:00.967 --> 19:02.800
armed robbery
and gun violence,

19:02.800 --> 19:04.734
and being prepared to die
by gun violence

19:04.734 --> 19:07.066
while committing
armed robbery.

19:07.066 --> 19:09.266
And this is by no means
a new problem.

19:09.266 --> 19:12.934
Even the term "gerrymandering"
goes back centuries.

19:12.934 --> 19:15.867
- It gets its name from
a 19th-century politician

19:15.867 --> 19:17.433
named Elbridge Gerry.

19:17.433 --> 19:19.000
As governor
of Massachusetts,

19:19.000 --> 19:20.867
he helped shape
a congressional district

19:20.867 --> 19:22.867
so blatantly one-sided

19:22.867 --> 19:25.734
that one critic said
it looked like a salamander.

19:25.734 --> 19:28.333
No, another replied,
a gerrymander.

19:28.333 --> 19:31.600
- Now, that counted
as a joke in 1810,

19:31.600 --> 19:33.533
back when your
entertainment options

19:33.533 --> 19:35.767
were sunsets,
Washington Irving novels,

19:35.767 --> 19:37.967
and getting kicked
by a horse.

19:37.967 --> 19:40.433
And quick side note,
you're not wrong to notice

19:40.433 --> 19:42.967
that the "Gerry"
in "gerrymander" refers to a guy

19:42.967 --> 19:45.333
whose name was actually
pronounced "Gary,"

19:45.333 --> 19:48.166
because literally everything
about gerrymandering

19:48.166 --> 19:50.266
is stupid and wrong.

19:50.266 --> 19:52.367
And look, there's nothing
inherently wrong

19:52.367 --> 19:53.967
with re-drawing
a voting district.

19:53.967 --> 19:55.367
It's actually necessary.

19:55.367 --> 19:58.734
They need to have around the
same number of people in them,

19:58.734 --> 20:02.700
and populations shift over time,
as people move or die

20:02.700 --> 20:05.233
or emigrate to America
because their stand-up careers

20:05.233 --> 20:07.033
have endured what
might be best characterized

20:07.033 --> 20:09.800
as a "pogrom of indifference."

20:09.800 --> 20:13.600
And that is why, every
ten years, we have a census,

20:13.600 --> 20:16.133
after which,
lines are re-drawn for both

20:16.133 --> 20:18.100
the U.S. House
and state legislatures.

20:18.100 --> 20:20.367
The problem is,
in most states,

20:20.367 --> 20:22.400
the lines are drawn
by politicians.

20:22.400 --> 20:24.133
In fact, in 37 states,

20:24.133 --> 20:26.300
the drawing of
state legislative districts

20:26.300 --> 20:29.467
is primarily controlled
by the legislators themselves,

20:29.467 --> 20:32.600
and they have a pretty
clear vested interest there.

20:32.600 --> 20:36.300
And if you think that seems
crazy, you're not alone.

20:36.300 --> 20:39.500
- Every fall, I speak
to five or six members

20:39.500 --> 20:41.734
of the British Parliament
that come over

20:41.734 --> 20:43.233
to shadow members of congress,

20:43.233 --> 20:44.734
and one of the things
I have to explain to them is,

20:44.734 --> 20:46.200
"Here's how you get
elected to the House."

20:46.200 --> 20:48.400
I have, you know--

20:48.400 --> 20:50.967
I see these shocked looks
on these British faces,

20:50.967 --> 20:52.367
and one time,
one stood up and said,

20:52.367 --> 20:53.900
"Well, that's terrible!

20:53.900 --> 20:56.500
"That's not the voters choosing
their representatives.

20:56.500 --> 20:59.166
That's the representatives
choosing their voters."

20:59.166 --> 21:01.834
- First, that's racist.

21:01.834 --> 21:03.000
And--

21:03.000 --> 21:05.767
And second--second,

21:05.767 --> 21:07.800
even I find it difficult

21:07.800 --> 21:09.633
hearing advice on map-drawing

21:09.633 --> 21:11.867
in a British accent
that once said,

21:11.867 --> 21:13.867
"I don't see
why one scrap of dust

21:13.867 --> 21:15.600
"is any
different from another.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.066
"So I ended the border here,

21:17.066 --> 21:19.133
"because that's where my pen
ran out of ink.

21:19.133 --> 21:20.567
"They'll learn to like it.

21:20.567 --> 21:23.200
What's the worst
that can happen?"

21:23.200 --> 21:25.200
But it is true
that if your party

21:25.200 --> 21:26.600
holds the redistricting pen,

21:26.600 --> 21:28.367
it wields substantial power,

21:28.367 --> 21:31.200
and there are multiple
techniques at its disposal.

21:31.200 --> 21:32.433
- There are a couple of ways

21:32.433 --> 21:34.533
that you can reapportion people

21:34.533 --> 21:36.333
and put them into districts,

21:36.333 --> 21:38.567
and there's a thing
called packing,

21:38.567 --> 21:40.333
and there's a thing
called cracking.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.433
- Yes,
"packing and cracking."

21:42.433 --> 21:44.867
Not to be confused
with the teen drug trend

21:44.867 --> 21:46.266
of "cracking and packing,"

21:46.266 --> 21:48.433
which is when the teens
hollow out a cucumber,

21:48.433 --> 21:49.667
fill it with crack,

21:49.667 --> 21:52.000
and put in their anus
to absorb it faster.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.400
I saw it on the local news,
which means it's real,

21:54.400 --> 21:58.333
and every teenager
is doing it right now.

21:58.333 --> 21:59.934
But in this context,

21:59.934 --> 22:03.300
"packing" means cramming
as many opposition voters

22:03.300 --> 22:05.400
as possible
into just a few districts.

22:05.400 --> 22:07.700
And "cracking" means
spreading them out thinly

22:07.700 --> 22:09.333
over a bunch of districts,

22:09.333 --> 22:11.967
so they can't gain
a majority in any one of them.

22:11.967 --> 22:14.133
Either way,
it dilutes their impact.

22:14.133 --> 22:17.567
Try and think of it as table
assignments at a wedding.

22:17.567 --> 22:20.633
You can either break up
your eight awful relatives

22:20.633 --> 22:22.734
and spread them out
over different tables,

22:22.734 --> 22:25.000
or you can pack them
all together

22:25.000 --> 22:28.100
in one insufferable
table of the damned.

22:28.100 --> 22:30.467
"The Washington Post"
showed how this can work.

22:30.467 --> 22:32.700
Look at this
hypothetical state.

22:32.700 --> 22:35.767
It's 60% blue voters,
40% red,

22:35.767 --> 22:38.233
and it needs to be carved up
into five districts.

22:38.233 --> 22:40.000
Now, proportionally,

22:40.000 --> 22:42.667
you would want three blue
and two red districts,

22:42.667 --> 22:44.567
but if you draw
the lines like this,

22:44.567 --> 22:47.934
you can get three
red majorities and two blues.

22:47.934 --> 22:49.467
And if you
draw it like this,

22:49.467 --> 22:52.967
you could get five blue
majorities and no red.

22:52.967 --> 22:55.133
And if you draw lines like this,
it looks like a dick,

22:55.133 --> 22:57.000
which is irrelevant
to this discussion,

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
but it is objectively
very funny.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.400
And--and if you are thinking,

23:02.400 --> 23:04.800
"Shouldn't all of this
be illegal?"

23:04.800 --> 23:06.567
Well, that's complicated.

23:06.567 --> 23:09.834
Because if you're gerrymandering
to disadvantage minorities,

23:09.834 --> 23:13.233
yes, that is illegal
under the Voting Rights Act.

23:13.233 --> 23:15.700
But if you're gerrymandering
to disadvantage voters

23:15.700 --> 23:19.000
of an opposing party,
that has generally been allowed.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.467
So racial gerrymandering?

23:20.467 --> 23:21.467
No.

23:21.467 --> 23:23.100
Partisan gerrymandering?

23:23.100 --> 23:24.900
That's kind of okay.

23:24.900 --> 23:27.100
And it's led politicians
to be pretty brazen

23:27.100 --> 23:28.333
in their behavior.

23:28.333 --> 23:30.734
Like in North Carolina
last year.

23:30.734 --> 23:32.767
Their congressional map
was thrown out

23:32.767 --> 23:34.767
in federal court
for racial gerrymandering,

23:34.767 --> 23:35.800
which is wrong.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.767
So they had to redraw.

23:37.767 --> 23:39.033
And while doing it,

23:39.033 --> 23:41.333
State Rep David Lewis
went out of his way

23:41.333 --> 23:42.934
to explain that the new map

23:42.934 --> 23:45.734
would not illegally
fuck over minorities.

23:45.734 --> 23:48.934
It would just legally
fuck over democrats.

23:48.934 --> 23:55.467
- We want
to make clear that we,

23:55.467 --> 23:58.600
to the extent are
going to use political data

23:58.600 --> 23:59.867
in drawing this map,

23:59.867 --> 24:03.233
it is to gain partisan
advantage on the map.

24:03.233 --> 24:07.800
I want that criteria to be
clearly stated and understood.

24:07.800 --> 24:11.200
- "I need you to understand
this is not a race thing,

24:11.200 --> 24:12.533
"because it can't be.

24:12.533 --> 24:14.867
"We just want a map
that churns out Republicans

24:14.867 --> 24:16.133
"like it's Ann Romney.

24:16.133 --> 24:17.500
"That is all we're saying.

24:17.500 --> 24:20.266
"That is all
we are saying here.

24:20.266 --> 24:23.166
Please let me understand."

24:23.166 --> 24:25.000
And that map worked.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.400
In 2016,
despite Republicans winning

24:27.400 --> 24:30.200
just over half the votes
in House races,

24:30.200 --> 24:34.433
they wound up controlling
77% of the state's seats.

24:34.433 --> 24:37.333
That is a more blatant
disregard for what people want

24:37.333 --> 24:40.400
than the asshole who gives
out Bazooka Joe on Halloween.

24:40.400 --> 24:41.600
Oh, great.

24:41.600 --> 24:43.433
Gum from the Roosevelt
administration

24:43.433 --> 24:44.633
wrapped in a comic

24:44.633 --> 24:46.700
from the other
Roosevelt administration.

24:46.700 --> 24:48.066
At least the guy handing out

24:48.066 --> 24:49.600
Snickers
stuffed with razor blades

24:49.600 --> 24:52.633
actually gives you
a Snickers.

24:52.633 --> 24:55.867
And Republicans elevated
this technique to an art form

24:55.867 --> 24:57.467
with a plan called REDMAP,

24:57.467 --> 25:00.367
or the Redistricting
Majority Project.

25:00.367 --> 25:02.867
They poured more than
$30 million

25:02.867 --> 25:05.367
into state-level races
ahead of the last redistricting,

25:05.367 --> 25:07.500
gaining huge numbers of seats,

25:07.500 --> 25:10.333
and that paid
massive dividends.

25:10.333 --> 25:11.867
- When Republicans
won the majority

25:11.867 --> 25:13.700
of state houses in 2010,

25:13.700 --> 25:17.467
it ensured they'd be redrawing
the maps in those states.

25:17.467 --> 25:20.934
And lo and behold,
it paid off in 2012.

25:20.934 --> 25:23.233
Nationwide, Democrats
running for congress

25:23.233 --> 25:26.233
got 1.1 million
more votes,

25:26.233 --> 25:30.300
but Republicans sent
33 more members to the house.

25:30.300 --> 25:31.400
- Exactly.

25:31.400 --> 25:32.567
So the maps they drew

25:32.567 --> 25:35.333
put Democrats
at a significant disadvantage.

25:35.333 --> 25:37.867
It's like if
instead of Tim Duncan,

25:37.867 --> 25:41.066
the San Antonio Spurs had
had to use Tim Burton.

25:41.066 --> 25:43.900
It's not technically
impossible to win,

25:43.900 --> 25:47.433
but it's going to be
much, much harder.

25:47.433 --> 25:50.533
And look, to some extent,
Republicans got lucky,

25:50.533 --> 25:53.367
because 2010 was a wave
election for their party,

25:53.367 --> 25:55.900
and I'm not saying Democrats
are angels here.

25:55.900 --> 25:56.967
By no means.

25:56.967 --> 25:58.300
When they have had control,

25:58.300 --> 26:00.734
they've gerrymandered the shit
out of districts

26:00.734 --> 26:02.300
in states like Maryland,

26:02.300 --> 26:03.934
and they've been
pretty brazen too.

26:03.934 --> 26:05.166
Take Illinois.

26:05.166 --> 26:07.400
In 2001,
the Democrats won the right

26:07.400 --> 26:09.600
to redistrict there after,
and this is for reasons

26:09.600 --> 26:12.200
too complicated
and too stupid to explain,

26:12.200 --> 26:14.033
a name was
pulled out of a replica

26:14.033 --> 26:16.066
of Abe Lincoln's
stovepipe hat,

26:16.066 --> 26:19.133
but--but just watch
as one Democratic lawmaker

26:19.133 --> 26:22.166
made the least
convincing promise ever.

26:22.166 --> 26:25.100
- Well, we'll sit down
and draw a very fair map.

26:27.200 --> 26:29.467
- Come on.

26:29.467 --> 26:31.834
Come on!

26:31.834 --> 26:35.567
That's an inherently
suspicious look on his face.

26:35.567 --> 26:38.667
That's the exact expression
of someone who just urinated

26:38.667 --> 26:41.266
in a public pool.

26:41.266 --> 26:44.100
"Water's warm today, huh?

26:44.100 --> 26:47.300
Enjoy your swim."

26:47.300 --> 26:50.266
So how do you know
if your district

26:50.266 --> 26:52.100
has been drawn
with nefarious intent?

26:52.100 --> 26:53.200
Well, that's tricky.

26:53.200 --> 26:55.100
Because too often,
people will just

26:55.100 --> 26:58.100
lazily point to districts
that have a weird shape.

26:58.100 --> 26:59.834
- North Carolina's
12th district

26:59.834 --> 27:01.400
looks like spilled coffee.

27:01.400 --> 27:04.834
Pennsylvania's 16th
is flexing its muscles.

27:04.834 --> 27:07.500
And one commentator compared
Maryland's 3rd

27:07.500 --> 27:10.033
to a broken-winged
pterodactyl.

27:10.033 --> 27:11.467
And then there's this.

27:11.467 --> 27:13.600
They call it the earmuffs.

27:13.600 --> 27:15.834
- Ah, yes,
an earmuff district,

27:15.834 --> 27:18.734
not to be confused
with "the" earmuff district,

27:18.734 --> 27:21.200
which is a one-block area
of Manhattan where sketchy men

27:21.200 --> 27:23.900
sell accessories made from
the fur of endangered species.

27:23.900 --> 27:26.166
You should go.
You should visit.

27:26.166 --> 27:27.967
But while
it is tempting to see

27:27.967 --> 27:30.266
something suspicious
in an odd-shaped district,

27:30.266 --> 27:32.100
there is
a pretty good argument

27:32.100 --> 27:35.900
against prioritizing
tidy lines above all else.

27:35.900 --> 27:38.000
- Dropping a bunch
of squares seems fair.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.367
It seems like if you could
just draw a grid like "Tron"

27:41.367 --> 27:44.033
that you could
put people into districts

27:44.033 --> 27:47.166
and there wouldn't be any sort
of manipulation in the process.

27:47.166 --> 27:50.800
But Americans don't live,
with the exception of Montana

27:50.800 --> 27:53.333
and, you know,
a few other square places,

27:53.333 --> 27:55.233
Americans don't live
in squares.

27:55.233 --> 27:58.533
Our communities
are irregular and random.

27:58.533 --> 27:59.633
- Yeah, that's true.

27:59.633 --> 28:01.834
American communities
are not square.

28:01.834 --> 28:03.600
They're like jazz music.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.433
They're free-form,
free-flowing,

28:05.433 --> 28:08.233
and they contain a troubling
amount of opioids.

28:08.233 --> 28:12.467
And there's no one
right way to draw a district.

28:12.467 --> 28:14.600
Reasonable people
will disagree.

28:14.600 --> 28:17.934
Some might prioritize a district
being politically competitive.

28:17.934 --> 28:20.066
Others might favor compactness.

28:20.066 --> 28:21.800
Others want to keep so-called

28:21.800 --> 28:23.600
"communities of interest"
together.

28:23.600 --> 28:26.433
The problem is, it may be
physically impossible to do

28:26.433 --> 28:28.667
all three of those things
in one place.

28:28.667 --> 28:30.967
In fact,
take that earmuff district.

28:30.967 --> 28:34.400
The thin line connecting the two
halves is just a single road,

28:34.400 --> 28:37.166
and people love
to make fun of that.

28:37.166 --> 28:40.033
- In Chicago,
squeezed between two freeways,

28:40.033 --> 28:43.033
this narrow strip
is needed to connect

28:43.033 --> 28:45.633
two halves
of a gerrymandered district

28:45.633 --> 28:49.533
to keep it contiguous
as is required.

28:49.533 --> 28:54.533
This is the way congress
gets around the contiguous rule

28:54.533 --> 28:56.800
because there's obviously
nobody living here.

28:56.800 --> 29:00.700
I mean, unless they're
homeless people, I guess.

29:00.700 --> 29:02.934
Anybody here?

29:02.934 --> 29:05.367
Any congressional voters
out there?

29:05.367 --> 29:08.100
- Now you may laugh,
but a few seconds later,

29:08.100 --> 29:10.600
an entire ghost baseball team
from the early 1900s

29:10.600 --> 29:12.133
walked out
of the tall grass

29:12.133 --> 29:14.533
and beat him to death
with their ghost bats.

29:14.533 --> 29:16.266
And he kind of deserved it.

29:16.266 --> 29:18.266
But--but here is
the thing, though.

29:18.266 --> 29:21.066
It is drawn like earmuffs
for good reasons.

29:21.066 --> 29:23.066
Because the northern
and southern parts

29:23.066 --> 29:24.767
are two Latino communities,

29:24.767 --> 29:26.133
and the district in the middle

29:26.133 --> 29:27.633
is predominantly
African-American.

29:27.633 --> 29:31.667
Both are Democratic, so it's
not about partisan advantage.

29:31.667 --> 29:33.667
It's about ensuring
that both communities

29:33.667 --> 29:35.934
have representatives
servicing their interests.

29:35.934 --> 29:37.700
And it's criticized a lot,

29:37.700 --> 29:40.633
but redistricting experts
absolutely love it.

29:40.633 --> 29:44.166
In fact, two of them actually
put it on their wedding cake.

29:44.166 --> 29:46.600
That is a real wedding cake.

29:46.600 --> 29:48.633
And I'm guessing that
the bachelorette party cake

29:48.633 --> 29:49.800
was something like,

29:49.800 --> 29:52.800
"One more night
of packing and cracking!"

29:52.800 --> 29:55.200
So--so to break it down,

29:55.200 --> 29:57.633
not all weird-shaped
districts are bad,

29:57.633 --> 30:00.266
and not all normal-shaped
districts are good.

30:00.266 --> 30:01.667
And there is one more thing.

30:01.667 --> 30:03.834
Gerrymandering
is not the sole reason

30:03.834 --> 30:06.633
for the mismatch between
our popular vote percentages

30:06.633 --> 30:08.400
and our representation.

30:08.400 --> 30:11.967
Some of that is due to where
Democrats choose to live.

30:11.967 --> 30:14.133
- Democrats live
in the wrong places basically.

30:14.133 --> 30:16.600
They've decided
to cram themselves in cities

30:16.600 --> 30:19.233
and that just makes it really
hard to have a winning coalition

30:19.233 --> 30:20.467
when your people do that.

30:20.467 --> 30:21.767
If you are college-educated,

30:21.767 --> 30:23.433
if you want to work
in the creative economy,

30:23.433 --> 30:24.867
you move to a city,

30:24.867 --> 30:26.734
and those places have enough
Democrats already.

30:26.734 --> 30:29.734
Democrats need to make places
like Des Moines or Columbus

30:29.734 --> 30:32.834
or Raleigh, North Carolina,
cool so that those young people

30:32.834 --> 30:34.166
move there,
but that's kind of outside

30:34.166 --> 30:36.667
of the typical realm
of political strategy.

30:36.667 --> 30:37.934
- Wait.

30:37.934 --> 30:40.700
What do you mean "make"
Des Moines cool?

30:40.700 --> 30:43.567
They've already got the
Des Moines Heritage Carousel,

30:43.567 --> 30:46.433
the most badass,
balls-to-the-wall carousel

30:46.433 --> 30:47.900
in the whole Midwest.

30:47.900 --> 30:49.667
And yes,
according to their website,

30:49.667 --> 30:52.266
it is closed for
the season of spring,

30:52.266 --> 30:54.500
which is not a good time
for carousels,

30:54.500 --> 30:56.233
but when May 28 rolls around,

30:56.233 --> 31:00.467
it's gonna be an all-out
carousel fuckstravaganza!

31:00.467 --> 31:03.100
Until 8:00 P.M.

31:03.100 --> 31:05.900
But it is true,
Democrats are basically

31:05.900 --> 31:07.900
packing themselves
into districts,

31:07.900 --> 31:10.333
and that is not likely
to change anytime soon.

31:10.333 --> 31:13.400
But there is a broader,
non-partisan point here,

31:13.400 --> 31:15.333
and that is that
in a democracy,

31:15.333 --> 31:17.367
the question of who
gets to draw the map

31:17.367 --> 31:19.333
should not have
as much significance

31:19.333 --> 31:20.700
as it currently does.

31:20.700 --> 31:23.467
Now, there's actually
a Supreme Court case coming up

31:23.467 --> 31:25.867
involving
a redistricting in Wisconsin

31:25.867 --> 31:29.500
that was so partisan, a lower
court struck their maps down,

31:29.500 --> 31:31.667
and the Supreme Court may,
for the first time,

31:31.667 --> 31:33.633
actually issue a clear ruling

31:33.633 --> 31:35.900
putting limits
on partisan gerrymandering.

31:35.900 --> 31:38.934
So all our hopes
are now in the delicious claws

31:38.934 --> 31:41.400
of Justice Neil Gorsuch.

31:41.400 --> 31:44.633
But even without a ruling,
many experts argue

31:44.633 --> 31:46.633
we should simply
be taking redistricting

31:46.633 --> 31:48.433
out of the hands
of politicians

31:48.433 --> 31:51.367
and give the task
to independent commissions,

31:51.367 --> 31:52.934
and that's a pretty good idea.

31:52.934 --> 31:56.433
In fact, a handful of states
already do some version of that.

31:56.433 --> 31:57.934
And it's not perfect.

31:57.934 --> 32:00.834
It is tough to completely
remove partisan biases,

32:00.834 --> 32:02.834
a fact that one
state lawmaker brought up

32:02.834 --> 32:04.800
to shoot the idea down.

32:04.800 --> 32:07.800
- If I felt there
were any way in the world

32:07.800 --> 32:10.300
that I could stand
before my constituents and say,

32:10.300 --> 32:12.500
"I believe that it's possible

32:12.500 --> 32:14.433
"to come up
with a group of people

32:14.433 --> 32:17.066
"who have no
political bias whatsoever

32:17.066 --> 32:19.533
"who will simply sit down
in a room

32:19.533 --> 32:22.000
and magically
create districts,"

32:22.000 --> 32:23.166
I'd be behind it.

32:23.166 --> 32:24.834
I'd be behind it 100%.

32:24.834 --> 32:27.033
But those people don't exist.

32:27.033 --> 32:28.633
- Now if you recognize
that guy,

32:28.633 --> 32:30.934
it's because you saw him
about ten minutes ago,

32:30.934 --> 32:33.533
reassuring everyone that
his intent in drawing districts

32:33.533 --> 32:36.300
was to gain partisan
advantage for Republicans.

32:36.300 --> 32:39.100
So he's essentially arguing
"nobody's unbiased,

32:39.100 --> 32:40.433
"so let's use me,

32:40.433 --> 32:43.467
the most brazenly biased man
in the universe,"

32:43.467 --> 32:45.000
which is pretty much arguing,

32:45.000 --> 32:48.934
"No babysitter's perfect,
so let's just use Slenderman."

32:48.934 --> 32:50.600
But while independent
commissions

32:50.600 --> 32:51.800
might not be perfect,

32:51.800 --> 32:53.700
they would definitely
be better.

32:53.700 --> 32:56.333
And the truth is, it's hard
to come up with a worse system

32:56.333 --> 32:58.433
than the one
most states currently have,

32:58.433 --> 33:01.100
and there is something
very important at stake here.

33:01.100 --> 33:04.500
Lawmakers should not be
allowed to dilute our votes

33:04.500 --> 33:06.033
by drawing
their own lines

33:06.033 --> 33:07.800
and essentially
picking their own voters.

33:07.800 --> 33:08.900
And you know--
you know what?

33:08.900 --> 33:10.400
I will tell you why.

33:10.400 --> 33:13.667
The foundations of democracy
are built on the idea

33:13.667 --> 33:16.033
that everybody's vote
should count equally.

33:16.033 --> 33:17.300
Everybody's.

33:17.300 --> 33:19.667
That is what America
is all about.

33:19.667 --> 33:23.767
That everyone--every one of us
should get an equal chance

33:23.767 --> 33:25.266
to make a bad decision

33:25.266 --> 33:27.967
which fucks things up
for everybody else.

33:27.967 --> 33:29.367
Whoever we are,

33:29.367 --> 33:31.133
however poor our decisions,

33:31.133 --> 33:32.700
whether you are a Juggalo.

33:32.700 --> 33:34.200
- Whoop whoop!
- Stop it.

33:34.200 --> 33:36.867
Or a 47-year-old
Quidditch player.

33:36.867 --> 33:38.567
- It's a sport!

33:38.567 --> 33:41.166
- Or someone who bought
that stupid $6,000 jacket

33:41.166 --> 33:42.867
I wore on the show last week.

33:42.867 --> 33:44.367
It's horrible.

33:44.367 --> 33:46.400
Our voices
should be fully heard

33:46.400 --> 33:49.367
even if we're
Scientologists or Parrotheads

33:49.367 --> 33:51.233
or guys who ride unicycles

33:51.233 --> 33:53.600
as their primary mode
of transportation.

33:53.600 --> 33:56.533
In this one context,
we should all be relevant

33:56.533 --> 33:59.100
regardless of our
questionable life choices.

33:59.100 --> 34:01.400
Whether you're an EDM bro...
- Yeah.

34:01.400 --> 34:03.934
- ...or a guy jamming
a knife into a toaster

34:03.934 --> 34:06.367
or a Washington Redskins fan...
- Whoo!

34:06.367 --> 34:08.600
- ...or even
a Jill Stein supporter.

34:08.600 --> 34:11.100
- She would've won!
- How would she have won?

34:11.100 --> 34:13.734
What process could she
have used to--

34:13.734 --> 34:16.066
The point is,
her voice should count

34:16.066 --> 34:17.800
as much as anyone else's.

34:17.800 --> 34:19.567
As much as a guy in a fedora

34:19.567 --> 34:21.900
or a baker of erotic pastries

34:21.900 --> 34:23.734
or a SantaCon attendee

34:23.734 --> 34:26.233
or everyone's racist grandma.

34:26.233 --> 34:28.200
Don't say anything.

34:28.200 --> 34:29.834
Because at the end of the day,

34:29.834 --> 34:31.633
that is the point
of this country.

34:31.633 --> 34:33.967
That's what made America great.

34:33.967 --> 34:35.800
Because think about it.
[cheers and applause]

34:35.800 --> 34:38.300
Election results
should not be the fault

34:38.300 --> 34:40.433
of lawmakers' crazy lines.

34:40.433 --> 34:43.800
They should be the result
of our own crazy decisions.

34:43.800 --> 34:45.200
Am I right?
[all cheering]

34:45.200 --> 34:46.800
Am I right?
[all cheering]

34:46.800 --> 34:48.266
That's our show.

34:48.266 --> 34:49.867
Thank you so much
for watching.

34:49.867 --> 34:51.367
We'll see you next week.

34:51.367 --> 34:53.033
Good night.

34:53.033 --> 34:55.633
She could not have won.
