00:08.091 --> 00:11.302
<i>Previously on</i> Riverdale:
My dad, he's--

00:11.386 --> 00:13.430
-A mobster.
-Archie, it's not just what he is.

00:13.763 --> 00:17.017
-It's what he's planning to do.
-I don't need to know.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.894
Would you describe my father
as a good man?

00:19.978 --> 00:21.438
I'd rather not say, miss.

00:21.521 --> 00:23.440
Oh, my God.
What happened to the twins?

00:23.523 --> 00:25.608
-I had them.
-You didn't call us.

00:25.692 --> 00:28.695
-Mom will be crushed.
-He has to go, Alice.

00:28.778 --> 00:30.697
Chic, he's kind of creepy.

00:30.780 --> 00:32.032
I just remembered
where I know Chic from.

00:32.115 --> 00:33.742
He's a video gigolo.
A web-cam boy.

00:34.159 --> 00:37.078
My parents know about the affair
with Sheriff Keller.

00:38.163 --> 00:39.289
Mayor McCoy is resigning.

00:39.372 --> 00:41.875
Hiram Lodge. He bought
Sunnyside Trailer Park.

00:41.958 --> 00:43.418
He said we can all stay.

00:43.501 --> 00:45.628
He is gobbling up the Southside
piece by piece.

00:50.175 --> 00:51.885
<i>I was running out of time.</i>

00:52.552 --> 00:54.679
<i>And maybe... so was Riverdale.</i>

00:55.972 --> 00:59.559
<i>Hiram Lodge had been making moves.</i>
<i>Big moves.</i>

00:59.642 --> 01:01.561
<i>But with no proof</i>
<i>of criminal behavior,</i>

01:01.644 --> 01:04.355
<i>all I could do was speculate.</i>

01:04.439 --> 01:07.233
<i>What was Hiram's master plan</i>
<i>for Riverdale?</i>

01:07.317 --> 01:10.236
<i>And why did it suddenly feel</i>
<i>so close to fruition?</i>

01:12.572 --> 01:13.406
Hey.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.410
-Hopefully...

01:17.494 --> 01:19.913
it's the article that saves the town
from Hiram Lodge.

01:19.996 --> 01:21.831
-Jughead...
-If I can fit the pieces together.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.166
You need to drop this.

01:23.249 --> 01:25.376
He rescued us.
He bought the trailer park.

01:25.543 --> 01:27.003
-Forgave our debts.

01:27.086 --> 01:29.088
He's the reason
we almost lost the trailer park.

01:29.172 --> 01:32.133
Hiram's slicker than a bottle
of snake oil, but this is--

01:32.217 --> 01:34.052
Dad. Please.

01:35.053 --> 01:37.847
Hiram Lodge just bought
the <i>Riverdale Register.</i>

01:38.723 --> 01:41.309
He's trying to silence dissenting voices
before he makes his big play.

01:41.392 --> 01:44.270
He's afraid.
He's afraid of this exposure.

01:47.065 --> 01:50.401
If you remember, the only house
in Riverdale with a pool was Thornhill.

01:50.485 --> 01:53.488
There we were, two drunk
teenagers looking to cool off.

01:53.571 --> 01:56.157
Why didn't you just go to the quarry?
Or Sweetwater River?

01:56.241 --> 01:59.452
What I remember
is someone borrowing the school van

01:59.536 --> 02:02.413
-for a joyride, you and Mary--
-That was Alice.

02:02.497 --> 02:05.708
This sounds like an episode
of <i>Saved by the Bell.</i>

02:08.378 --> 02:12.590
Hey, Fred, why don't you join
Hermione and me in the study?

02:12.674 --> 02:14.676
I have this 30-year-old rum.
You'll love it.

02:14.759 --> 02:16.427
Well, can't say no to that.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.014
-Veronica, stay with Archie.
-Mm-hm.

02:25.311 --> 02:29.607
I can't keep doing this anymore.
He's your brother and it is weird.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.652
Kevin, every time I try asking Chic
questions about himself,

02:32.735 --> 02:35.905
he gets defensive
or starts to cry as a diversion.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.323
But catfishing him?

02:37.407 --> 02:40.118
It's the only way I can get Chic
to open up.

02:50.169 --> 02:52.547
<i>So, do you ever PNP?</i>

02:52.630 --> 02:54.132
<i>You know, Party 'n Play?</i>

02:54.507 --> 02:57.135
You keep asking me
and I keep telling you no.

02:59.012 --> 03:03.308
This is our third time camming,
and you haven't really told me

03:03.391 --> 03:04.809
<i>anything about yourself.</i>

03:05.310 --> 03:08.605
You haven't taken your shirt off yet,
so we're even.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.941
I'm... shy.

03:16.529 --> 03:17.363
<i>Okay.</i>

03:18.990 --> 03:20.575
<i>What do you wanna know?</i>

03:21.534 --> 03:22.827
What are they talking about?

03:22.911 --> 03:27.415
So, between us, the deputy mayor
who took over for Josie's mom

03:27.498 --> 03:29.709
is on the verge of stepping down.

03:29.792 --> 03:32.337
There's going to be a special election...

03:32.420 --> 03:36.799
and my parents think your dad
would make an ideal candidate.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.551
They want my dad to run for mayor?

03:38.635 --> 03:41.846
It's business and politics.
They go hand-in-hand.

03:43.139 --> 03:46.142
Dad, is this something
you're seriously considering?

03:49.646 --> 03:53.775
Being mayor is something I dreamed
about ever since I was a kid, son.

03:53.858 --> 03:55.276
In the back of my mind.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.112
I know Riverdale's had
a lot of downs lately,

03:58.196 --> 04:01.199
but maybe I can help
get it back on an up-swing.

04:01.282 --> 04:04.118
You don't think it's weird
Mr. Lodge is asking you to run?

04:04.202 --> 04:07.080
He's not dumb.
He spends a lot of money in Riverdale.

04:07.163 --> 04:09.624
It makes sense he wants
a friend in the mayor's office.

04:09.707 --> 04:13.503
-He offered to make a donation

04:13.586 --> 04:16.714
to help me get going.
But to be clear, Archie...

04:17.298 --> 04:18.549
if I decide to run... it won't be for him.

04:21.886 --> 04:23.638
It would be for Riverdale.

04:24.222 --> 04:25.056
For me.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.142
For you.

04:39.195 --> 04:40.029
Mother.

04:40.571 --> 04:42.198
Strange man I've never met.

04:42.740 --> 04:45.576
Cheryl, this is Mr. Lazenby,
our estate attorney.

04:45.660 --> 04:48.454
Your father left a secret will.

04:49.664 --> 04:50.707
Of course he did.

04:51.499 --> 04:53.376
But Daddy died months ago.

04:53.459 --> 04:56.713
Mr. Blossom's instructions
were to reveal his will

04:56.796 --> 05:00.008
only after the authorities
concluded their investigation

05:00.091 --> 05:02.927
-into his side business.

05:03.011 --> 05:06.306
-Don't be so gauche. Per Clifford's instructions,
he requested I withhold information

05:09.767 --> 05:12.228
including the names
of his beneficiaries,

05:12.729 --> 05:15.565
until a public will reading.
How's tomorrow afternoon?

05:16.232 --> 05:19.569
It's been a long time coming,
Alice, but I'm out.

05:20.528 --> 05:21.988
I'm done fighting.

05:23.573 --> 05:24.782
I want a divorce.

05:24.866 --> 05:27.410
-No.

05:28.244 --> 05:29.996
And this isn't about that.

05:30.079 --> 05:34.417
This about how I worshiped you,
like a goddess, for 20 years.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.544
We raised a family together.

05:36.627 --> 05:41.132
And then the first chance you get,
you side with a stranger over me.

05:41.215 --> 05:42.175
You too, Betty.

05:42.258 --> 05:46.012
I can't believe you would choose
Chic's side over your own father.

05:46.095 --> 05:49.682
Dad, if this is truly about Chic,
then I'm with you, okay?

05:49.766 --> 05:51.642
Let's ask him to move out.

05:51.726 --> 05:54.520
You sold <i>The Register</i>
to that scum bag Hiram.

05:54.604 --> 05:58.691
-I should be the one divorcing you.
-Hiram offered me a fair price.

05:59.484 --> 06:01.778
Half of which I will give to you...

06:02.653 --> 06:04.363
if you agree to set me free.

06:05.281 --> 06:06.157
Immediately.

06:07.784 --> 06:08.868
I'm listening.

06:13.081 --> 06:16.125
I'd put the odds
at Fred saying yes at about 50/50.

06:16.334 --> 06:19.087
As always, <i>mija,</i> anything you can
whisper into Archie's ear...

06:19.796 --> 06:23.007
Mom, he's my boyfriend.
Not a constituent.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.342
You influence Archie.

06:25.009 --> 06:26.385
Archie influences Fred.

06:26.469 --> 06:29.555
-We need Fred now.
When we announce our plans--

06:29.639 --> 06:33.142
It'll sound better coming out
of his well-respected mouth.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.269
Fine. I'll do my best.

06:37.355 --> 06:40.483
Are you still going after Hiram?
-That depends.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.443
Who's asking

06:43.194 --> 06:45.446
Veronica

06:45.530 --> 06:48.324
Jug... there's gonna be
a special election...

06:48.783 --> 06:50.159
to replace Josie's mom.

06:50.701 --> 06:53.329
-Hiram Lodge wants my dad to run.
Why?

06:53.412 --> 06:54.288
Who knows?

06:54.372 --> 06:57.291
I'm with Veronica.
That means I'm with the Lodges.

06:57.375 --> 07:00.795
But my dad... I can't let him
get in any deeper with them.

07:00.878 --> 07:02.672
So, tell him he shouldn't run.

07:02.755 --> 07:05.675
Veronica would kill me if I did,
ditto the Lodges.

07:07.135 --> 07:09.971
Maybe I could give you something,
maybe you could write about it

07:10.054 --> 07:12.640
and that might make my dad hit pause.

07:13.558 --> 07:14.642
Okay.

07:16.519 --> 07:19.313
You remember when Hiram Lodge
gave Pop Tate that charitable donation

07:19.397 --> 07:21.023
-Yeah, we were all there.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.609
Except Hiram Lodge
didn't give Pop's a donation.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.445
-He bought the diner.

07:25.528 --> 07:28.281
And he doesn't want anyone
to know about it.

07:28.364 --> 07:30.741
Can you do something with that fact?

07:30.825 --> 07:34.078
At least enough to make my dad think
twice about this mayor idea?

07:34.162 --> 07:35.830
-Yes.

07:40.334 --> 07:43.754
My God. Hiram is like Dracula.
He's snapping up properties

07:43.838 --> 07:46.257
from all over Riverdale
to expand his empire and feed.

07:47.341 --> 07:49.469
If what you're telling me is true...

07:51.137 --> 07:52.513
everyone is in danger.

08:01.022 --> 08:05.234
I figured out Hiram's methodology.
He acquires devalued land at a deep--

08:05.318 --> 08:07.028
Some might say criminal. --discount.

08:07.111 --> 08:09.405
The Twilight Drive-in,
Sunnyside Trailer Park,

08:09.489 --> 08:11.782
Southside High
and now Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe.

08:13.910 --> 08:17.205
Yeah, and while most people didn't
care about Hiram's other acquisitions,

08:17.288 --> 08:18.706
probably because they were on
the Southside--

08:18.789 --> 08:23.377
-Pop's is the heart of Riverdale.
-Right. People will care about this one.

08:23.461 --> 08:25.296
So, when are you talking to Pop?

08:26.672 --> 08:32.512
Your dad needs 1200 signatures
before he can even run for mayor.

08:32.595 --> 08:33.429
Uh-huh.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.890
<i>So, I was thinking,</i>
<i>if you're not doing anything,</i>

08:35.973 --> 08:39.769
<i></i>

08:39.852 --> 08:41.854
I have homework to catch-up on.
I'll talk to you later.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.856
-Wait, Archie--

08:54.158 --> 08:57.411
Polly,
what are you doing home again?

08:57.495 --> 08:59.956
She just walked through the door
with these perfect babies.

09:00.039 --> 09:02.124
I thought it would be nice
to surprise Mom.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.963
And I was surprised
to meet our brother.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.132
-You have to hold one.
-I'd love to.

09:13.302 --> 09:14.136
Here.

09:25.648 --> 09:29.110
Where's Dad? Are we gonna
go to the will reading together?

09:30.361 --> 09:32.029
What?

09:32.113 --> 09:34.073
You

09:38.202 --> 09:41.414
Cheryl, I agreed to come
to this will reading,

09:41.497 --> 09:43.541
but I didn't agree to a makeover.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.836
Unless it involves that blouse.

09:47.962 --> 09:48.963
Nice, right?

09:49.797 --> 09:53.801
For the record,<i> j'adore</i> your
flannel mesh aesthetic.

09:53.884 --> 09:57.680
I'm merely augmenting it
for the occasion.

09:58.180 --> 10:00.766
What is going on in here, Cheryl?

10:01.601 --> 10:06.105
Mrs. Blossom. Hi, I'm Toni Topaz.
I'm a friend of Cheryl's from school.

10:06.188 --> 10:08.858
And she's lending
me an outfit for the will reading.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.485
And why on earth would you be there?

10:11.569 --> 10:14.947
I invited her.
To be my emotional support.

10:16.824 --> 10:20.411
Just make sure you're downstairs
before the guests arrive.

10:20.494 --> 10:23.914
We need to present a united front
against those scavengers.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.461
Ugh. She's a nightmare.

10:29.420 --> 10:30.546
Isn't she, though?

10:31.088 --> 10:32.840
<i>Hey, Arch, check this out.</i>

10:34.175 --> 10:36.010
When I applied to college
to be an urban planner--

10:36.093 --> 10:38.054
This was before
Grandpa Artie got sick.

10:38.137 --> 10:42.433
--this was the presentation I made
for some program I never got into.

10:43.017 --> 10:47.980
"Riverdale 2020: Small Town
with a Big Future." Sounds corny, huh?

10:48.064 --> 10:50.524
-No, Dad, this is awesome.

10:50.608 --> 10:51.609
Hello?

10:52.276 --> 10:54.070
Archie

10:55.738 --> 10:57.531
Oh, goody, you're both here.

10:59.158 --> 11:02.620
So, I fully realize I'm putting
the cart before the horse,

11:02.787 --> 11:06.749
but I was spitballing some design
ideas and I think I may have come up

11:06.832 --> 11:09.210
with a few potential campaign logos.

11:09.293 --> 11:11.879
I-- Veronica, those are terrific.

11:11.962 --> 11:15.091
I gotta say, but-- Oh.
Now, that one, that's my favorite.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.717
-Mm.
-Mine too.

11:19.720 --> 11:24.392
Great. So, I'll have some buttons
and t-shirts printed ASAP.

11:26.477 --> 11:29.146
<i>Why are you pushing this on him?</i>
-I'm not.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.816
I think your dad
would make a great mayor.

11:31.899 --> 11:33.442
Why are you resisting?

11:33.526 --> 11:36.362
Because my dad is not cut out
for what your parents want.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.739
Which is what, in your mind?

11:38.823 --> 11:41.075
A dog on a leash
who does what its told.

11:41.158 --> 11:43.702
And, if not, they'll push him out
like they did Mayor McCoy.

11:43.786 --> 11:47.123
Archie, Mayor McCoy had an affair
with Sheriff Keller.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.249
That's why she stepped down.

11:48.332 --> 11:52.002
My parents had nothing to do with it,
which I would swear to on the Bible.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.046
I feel like you're steering me.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.715
Like you're steering my dad.
It's not cool.

11:59.718 --> 12:01.095
Just ease off him.

12:03.305 --> 12:04.140
Okay.

12:08.894 --> 12:12.189
"I, Clifford Cochrane Blossom,
being of sound mind and body

12:12.273 --> 12:16.318
do here inscribe the terms
of my last will and testament.

12:16.402 --> 12:19.780
Firstly, ownership of Thistlehouse...

12:20.614 --> 12:23.993
will stay with our beloved matriarch,
Roseanne Blossom.

12:26.537 --> 12:29.832
To my wife and partner Penelope,
I leave ownership

12:29.915 --> 12:32.460
of our greatest treasure, Thornhill,

12:32.835 --> 12:35.212
the exquisite mansion
she made a home."

12:35.296 --> 12:39.842
The charred husk of an empty house.
That sounds about right, Mother.

12:39.925 --> 12:43.387
Now, the reason I contacted you
and you traveled to be here.

12:45.139 --> 12:49.226
Any and all remaining assets
of my fortune will be divided in half.

12:49.935 --> 12:54.857
The first half will be distributed equally
to anyone in Riverdale who can prove,

12:54.940 --> 12:59.153
with medical authentication,
that even one drop of Blossom blood

12:59.236 --> 13:00.779
flows through their veins."

13:01.614 --> 13:02.907
I knew it.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.534
Alice, what the hell
are you doing here?

13:05.618 --> 13:07.786
Accusing you publicly.
You only wanted a divorce

13:07.870 --> 13:11.790
so that you could cheat me
out of your big fancy Blossom payday.

13:11.874 --> 13:15.085
Not just my payday.
The girls share Blossom blood, too.

13:15.169 --> 13:19.006
My lawyer is gonna rip you apart.
Isn't that right, Attorney McCoy?

13:19.089 --> 13:22.343
I will be taking half of whatever
blood money you get

13:22.426 --> 13:27.056
from this inbred cesspool of a family.
Yeah, that's right, I said inbred.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.432
Would you please leave?

13:28.516 --> 13:32.019
Shut your face,
you half-melted, 10-cent trollop.

13:32.102 --> 13:34.104
This is riveting. I can't breathe.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.526
The usual, Jughead?
-Not today, Pop.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.986
Actually, I have a question.

13:42.780 --> 13:45.115
Did Hiram Lodge
buy this diner from you?

13:54.792 --> 13:55.793
Jughead...

13:57.211 --> 14:00.381
the Tates have owned this diner
for over 80 years.

14:01.465 --> 14:05.427
When my Ma gave me the keys,
she made me promise

14:05.511 --> 14:10.808
that no matter what I'd always keep
this shop in our family.

14:10.891 --> 14:14.645
Now, I did what I needed to
with Mr. Lodge...

14:15.729 --> 14:18.274
but my mother's still with us,
God bless.

14:19.483 --> 14:23.445
It would kill her
to hear I went against her wishes.

14:24.446 --> 14:27.491
Please, Jug,
can you keep this to yourself?

14:28.075 --> 14:29.660
While I still have my mom?

14:32.246 --> 14:35.332
And then you can tell
whoever you want.

14:39.128 --> 14:42.965
Now that the, uh, interloper has been
escorted from the premises,

14:43.048 --> 14:45.759
we can finish our business.
As I was saying...

14:45.843 --> 14:48.971
"The other half of my fortune
will go to my true heirs,

14:49.054 --> 14:50.264
Jason and Cheryl."

15:05.404 --> 15:09.241
As the one true Blossom heir,
I feel it is my sacred duty

15:09.325 --> 15:10.451
to say a few words.

15:11.368 --> 15:12.578
The Blossoms have been
bathing in blood

15:12.661 --> 15:15.164
since Great-Grandpappy Blossom
killed his brother.

15:16.206 --> 15:18.208
The original sin of Riverdale.

15:19.543 --> 15:23.088
Well, I stand here
before you to say: No more.

15:25.215 --> 15:26.133
No more blood.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.094
No more madness.

15:31.639 --> 15:32.848
No more horror.

15:34.141 --> 15:35.392
Hear, hear.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.815
Couldn't have said it better myself.

15:58.666 --> 16:02.002
Oh, Mumzie,
I had the most frightful daymare.

16:02.878 --> 16:04.088
Daddy was back.

16:07.925 --> 16:10.386
Calm down, it's not what you think.

16:10.469 --> 16:11.345
Hello, Cheryl.

16:12.888 --> 16:14.348
I'm your uncle Claudius.

16:14.431 --> 16:16.266
-Twin to your father.

16:16.350 --> 16:19.269
But Daddy never said anything
about having a brother.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.021
Allow me to explain.

16:26.360 --> 16:30.447
When, uh-- When Clifford and I were boys,
we were inseparable.

16:30.531 --> 16:32.449
A modern-day Romulus and Remus.

16:33.033 --> 16:36.328
And it became apparent
that I was being primed to inherit

16:36.412 --> 16:37.579
the Blossom empire.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.709
Until our 14th birthday.

16:42.292 --> 16:45.504
Clifford and I were down
by Sweetwater River, and he, uh...

16:47.715 --> 16:51.051
He pointed a rifle at me,
with eyes void of humanity.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.262
He told me about the Blossom curse.

16:53.345 --> 16:56.390
How one of the twins always meets
a violent end.

16:56.473 --> 16:58.350
And often at the hands of the other.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.270
Well, he spared me.

17:03.147 --> 17:06.692
That very night, I ran away from home
without a trace.

17:06.775 --> 17:08.277
It broke my heart.

17:09.069 --> 17:13.240
-I couldn't bear to speak your name.
-I joined the Merchant Marines.

17:14.533 --> 17:18.120
Sailed the seas desperate
to outrun the Blossom curse.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.915
<i>How soon do you think</i>
<i>we can get this blood test done?</i>

17:21.999 --> 17:25.294
-I'll call and check.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.754
Polly, what's the rush?

17:26.837 --> 17:29.006
I just wanna know
how much money we're inheriting.

17:29.089 --> 17:31.383
Between you, me, Chic and the babies,

17:31.467 --> 17:33.677
we could start
our own version of the Farm.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.972
-Uh, I'm not getting my blood tested.
Really, Chic?

17:37.056 --> 17:37.973
How come?

17:38.891 --> 17:40.350
I don't know these people.

17:40.434 --> 17:43.270
They're your cousins.
We're all Blossoms, like it or not.

17:43.353 --> 17:44.897
I'm not, thank the Lord.

17:44.980 --> 17:47.191
-I don't want their blood money.
-Don't be stupid.

17:47.274 --> 17:48.609
I said I don't want their money.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.237
Besides, needles trigger me.

17:52.821 --> 17:55.866
Leave your brother alone.
He can decide for himself.

17:57.993 --> 18:00.913
Mom, I decided something.

18:02.664 --> 18:04.833
I'm happy to do
the family's bidding at school.

18:05.542 --> 18:07.753
But Archie is off the table.

18:09.713 --> 18:12.883
-No. Not even close.

18:12.966 --> 18:15.344
But I am afraid of losing Archie.

18:15.427 --> 18:19.056
He's become a pawn on our chess
board and it's hurting our relationship.

18:19.139 --> 18:20.015
Veronica.

18:21.433 --> 18:25.896
In this business of ours, the women
always walk the razor's edge.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.399
The men are the gangsters.
But us, the molls...

18:30.651 --> 18:33.278
we use our wiles, our cunning.

18:34.613 --> 18:37.866
A hand on an elbow,
a whisper in an ear...

18:38.992 --> 18:41.453
to manage things
from behind the scenes.

18:41.537 --> 18:44.373
Maybe, but not me, not with Archie.

18:46.959 --> 18:47.960
You're right.

18:50.337 --> 18:53.382
You're right to protect
your relationship with Archie.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.053
We gotta get aggressive.

18:58.637 --> 19:02.099
Chic's turning down money because
he's refusing to take a blood test.

19:02.182 --> 19:05.310
We need to find out why.
What exactly is he hiding?

19:05.394 --> 19:08.272
What am I supposed to do?
Just ask him?

19:09.940 --> 19:10.899
I have a plan.

19:12.484 --> 19:13.819
It's slightly insane.

19:16.989 --> 19:17.948
<i>Hey, stranger.</i>

19:18.031 --> 19:19.700
<i>Been missing your cute face.</i>

19:20.951 --> 19:21.869
<i>Where'd you go?</i>

19:21.952 --> 19:24.663
Uh, yeah, sorry I went MIA.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.373
I actually...

19:27.541 --> 19:30.043
just got tested for the first time.

19:32.087 --> 19:34.798
<i>And I'm negative,</i>
<i>but it's been pretty intense.</i>

19:34.882 --> 19:38.051
Your first test? Congrats, cowboy.
That's a milestone.

19:38.135 --> 19:39.219
Mm.

19:39.970 --> 19:41.930
Uh, do you

19:42.431 --> 19:43.932
<i>I used to go every week.</i>

19:44.558 --> 19:47.311
<i>-Man, I had the worst scare once.</i>


19:47.519 --> 19:51.356
What
-Yeah, it's a long story...

19:52.357 --> 19:54.484
but I was living with a rougher crew
than I am now.

19:54.568 --> 19:56.820
<i>Who</i>

19:59.781 --> 20:01.617
Are you talking to somebody else?

20:07.122 --> 20:09.750
-That's it, I'm out.

20:09.833 --> 20:12.920
Sorry, but your brother
seems like a really good guy.

20:13.003 --> 20:16.548
This is starting to make me feel
like a bad person. I'm done.

20:20.928 --> 20:23.931
Well? Did Pops confirm
Mr. Lodge bought the diner?

20:24.014 --> 20:24.932
Yeah, he did.

20:26.516 --> 20:30.520
I'm sorry. I can't publish that article.
It would break Pop's heart.

20:31.688 --> 20:33.941
Jug, we can't give up,
I think my dad's gonna run.

20:34.024 --> 20:36.860
Archie, I have talked
to every possible suspect

20:36.944 --> 20:38.737
connected to the Lodges,
even Mayor McCoy.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.322
They're all on lock-down.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.866
Maybe you've been talking
to the wrong McCoy.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.619
I'm brunching, Archie.
What do you want?

20:46.703 --> 20:49.831
My dad is seconds away from running
for mayor with the Lodges' support.

20:49.915 --> 20:52.417
I don't want him to go through
what your mom did.

20:52.501 --> 20:55.587
I was thinking
you could get your mom to talk to him.

20:55.754 --> 20:58.423
-Even secretly.
-My mom barely made it out

20:58.507 --> 21:00.175
of the mayor's office alive.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.720
If she let slip even a whisper
of what went down

21:03.804 --> 21:06.932
between her and the Lodges,
there'd be hell to pay.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.643
She'd implicate herself
in about a million ways.

21:09.726 --> 21:13.981
Yeah, I figured, but isn't there plenty
of stuff your mom could say to my dad

21:14.064 --> 21:17.025
that would kill his buzz
without getting into the shady stuff?

21:18.735 --> 21:22.698
It's not all ribbon ceremonies
and catered affairs, Fred.

21:23.407 --> 21:24.866
It's filling pot-holes.

21:25.409 --> 21:26.660
Collecting trash.

21:27.953 --> 21:31.957
And if you think you can run this town
plus Andrews Construction

21:32.040 --> 21:35.544
-at the same time, forget it.
-I've got a good team working for me.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.797
And then there are
the uglier aspects of the job.

21:39.548 --> 21:43.760
-Crime, poverty, threats--

21:44.803 --> 21:48.765
Right now, you might be
the people's shining hope of Riverdale.

21:49.349 --> 21:51.268
But say you do win, Fred...

21:51.643 --> 21:54.980
they'll turn their back on you.
And all your friends...

21:55.689 --> 21:58.692
...will be standing in line
to stab you in the back.

21:59.151 --> 22:03.405
-I appreciate the real talk, Sierra.
-I haven't gotten to the real talk.

22:03.989 --> 22:07.284
Let's chat about the pittance
that is the mayor's salary.

22:13.040 --> 22:13.915
It's okay.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.422
-Hello.
-Mom.

22:21.506 --> 22:24.301
-Not right now. I'm with the twins.

22:24.384 --> 22:25.677
Take the bus or walk.

22:36.980 --> 22:39.441
Pop Tate. To what do I owe this honor?

22:39.941 --> 22:42.152
Sorry to bother you
at home, Mr. Lodge.

22:44.071 --> 22:44.905
Come in.

22:48.116 --> 22:51.912
Apparently... Jughead Jones
is asking questions

22:51.995 --> 22:53.497
about the ownership
of the Chock'lit Shoppe.

22:54.081 --> 22:56.208
-Jughead Jones.
-Daddy...

22:56.291 --> 22:58.251
Did Pop Tate keep his mouth shut?

22:58.460 --> 23:00.462
-More or less.
-Then Jughead has nothing.

23:00.545 --> 23:04.591
No, what he has is someone from our
inner-circle feeding him information.

23:04.674 --> 23:08.220
The only people that know
we own Pop's are the three of us...

23:09.679 --> 23:10.931
and Archie Andrews.

23:11.765 --> 23:14.309
He's proven his loyalty,
but what's to say

23:14.392 --> 23:16.478
he isn't feeding information to Jug?

23:16.561 --> 23:17.395
It was me.

23:19.439 --> 23:20.982
I told Jughead about Pop's.

23:22.192 --> 23:25.237
When we were at Shadow Lake,
Jughead was grilling me

23:25.320 --> 23:26.446
about the Southside.

23:26.530 --> 23:29.157
Asking incessant questions
about SoDale...

23:29.574 --> 23:31.451
the Trailer Park, Southside High.

23:31.535 --> 23:33.995
I had to get him off the scent,
so I distracted him

23:34.079 --> 23:36.164
with the smallest truth I could,
the diner.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.083
Veronica, so help me...

23:38.166 --> 23:40.127
-That is a--
-That was quick thinking, <i>mija.</i>

23:40.627 --> 23:41.753
What?

23:42.754 --> 23:44.464
You can't possibly think
that was a prudent choice.

23:44.548 --> 23:45.715
I do.

23:46.299 --> 23:49.636
Veronica wisely threw the dog
a relatively harmless bone

23:49.719 --> 23:52.889
to keep him from digging up
a much bigger, more controversial one.

23:52.973 --> 23:54.599
Yes, exactly.

23:54.683 --> 23:58.562
Her gambit bought us the time we need
for preemptive damage control.

23:59.437 --> 24:01.731
<i>Ojal</i>á<i>,</i> you two are right.

24:03.650 --> 24:05.443
<i>Hiram's gonna beat the clock.</i>

24:05.527 --> 24:09.072
Feels like every step I make,
he's two or 10 steps ahead of me.

24:09.906 --> 24:10.866
He's lapping me.

24:10.949 --> 24:13.577
He's been winning at this game
a lot longer than you've been alive.

24:13.660 --> 24:18.373
Because he's been rigging the game.
Everyone's afraid to speak against him.

24:20.417 --> 24:21.293
You know, uh...

24:22.544 --> 24:26.089
there's one person you haven't asked
to go on the record yet.

24:27.465 --> 24:28.466
Who?

24:29.968 --> 24:30.886
Me.

24:33.305 --> 24:36.558
Back in the day, Hiram asked me
and the Serpents to trash the drive-in

24:36.641 --> 24:39.186
so he could buy it
for a rock-bottom price.

24:40.979 --> 24:41.897
We complied. On purpose?

24:47.194 --> 24:48.820
You worked for Hiram Lodge?

24:49.196 --> 24:52.741
I'll own up to that, on the record,
if it'll help you bring him down.

24:58.496 --> 24:59.956
<i>Jughead Jones.</i>

25:00.624 --> 25:03.251
<i>I have information</i>
<i>about Hiram Lodge's plans.</i>

25:03.668 --> 25:06.129
<i>Riverdale Bus Terminal, 20 minutes.</i>

25:08.798 --> 25:09.633
Who was that?

25:10.467 --> 25:11.343
I have no idea.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.764
But you may not have to go
on the record just yet.

25:33.490 --> 25:35.116
I'm gonna kill you.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.994
You're leaking private information
about my family.

25:38.078 --> 25:39.788
Information my father trusted you with.

25:39.871 --> 25:41.998
-If this is about Pop's--
-Damn right it is.

25:42.082 --> 25:44.376
Lucky for you,
I fell on the sword and saved you

25:44.459 --> 25:46.419
-from my his apocalyptic wrath.
-You didn't have to do that.

25:46.503 --> 25:47.545
Yes, I did.

25:48.129 --> 25:51.508
If my dad ever found out
you snitched, do you know

25:51.591 --> 25:52.550
what he would do to you?

25:52.634 --> 25:55.595
I'm not gonna apologize
for trying to protect my dad.

25:56.179 --> 25:57.264
From my parents?

25:57.931 --> 26:00.558
Archie, this isn't
<i>The Manchurian Candidate.</i>

26:01.309 --> 26:05.105
Your father is an untouchable.
He'll never be hurt or corrupted.

26:06.064 --> 26:07.983
What happened to your loyalty?

26:08.191 --> 26:11.278
We brought you into this.
You were fine with it.

26:11.361 --> 26:14.114
-You made a promise.
-You wanted my eyes wide open

26:14.197 --> 26:17.117
before I committed to your family.
You insisted upon it, in fact.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.452
If my dad is gonna run for mayor
with your parents,

26:19.536 --> 26:21.246
he deserves to know the whole truth
and so do I.

26:21.329 --> 26:22.747
What whole truth?

26:22.831 --> 26:25.083
His big secret plan for the Southside.

26:25.166 --> 26:28.086
You were almost gonna tell me
at your confirmation, but I stopped you.

26:28.586 --> 26:30.422
Well, now I wanna know.

26:31.047 --> 26:32.924
For myself and for my dad.

26:33.133 --> 26:34.259
That's...

26:35.051 --> 26:36.594
That's something
you'll have to talk to my dad about.

26:37.178 --> 26:40.515
-Oh, hey. There you are. Hey, Veronica.
-Hi, Mr. Andrews.

26:40.640 --> 26:43.351
Perfect timing.
Uh, I have an announcement to make.

26:43.435 --> 26:47.230
You two are looking at the next
candidate for mayor of Riverdale.

26:49.566 --> 26:52.068
Guess you better talk to my dad fast.

27:25.310 --> 27:28.229
Wasn't it better when it was just
me, you and Mom?

27:28.730 --> 27:30.607
You

27:30.690 --> 27:31.775
Love is finite.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.278
People run out of it eventually.

27:36.654 --> 27:39.866
They stop loving you
or they start loving someone else.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.327
One day, the sun's shining down
on you.

27:42.952 --> 27:45.455
The next, you're alone, and it's cold...

27:46.873 --> 27:47.707
and dark. Chic...

27:52.545 --> 27:53.588
are you okay?

27:55.965 --> 27:58.051
Don't use my bathroom again, Betty.

28:11.022 --> 28:14.109
<i>♪ He said he would stay ♪</i>

28:15.151 --> 28:18.446
<i>♪ But now he's gone ♪</i>

28:19.406 --> 28:23.868
<i>♪ Somebody please tell me why ♪</i>

28:23.952 --> 28:27.455
<i>♪ Tell me why ♪</i>

28:36.005 --> 28:37.215
I haven't much time.

28:37.799 --> 28:39.050
Are you Deep Throat?

28:39.843 --> 28:42.804
You've been calling everyone in town
for information about Hiram Lodge,

28:42.887 --> 28:43.847
but not me.

28:44.848 --> 28:46.224
That's why I called you.

28:48.601 --> 28:53.022
No offense, but how does a bus driver
have insider information on Lodge?

28:54.774 --> 28:57.777
I used to be... someone else.

28:58.737 --> 29:02.240
Someone who was privy
to Hiram Lodge's personal affairs.

29:03.450 --> 29:06.536
Someone who suffered at his whims.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.247
What kind of personal affairs?

29:09.706 --> 29:12.208
I coordinated transportation
for Mr. Lodge.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.878
Sometimes out to Shankshaw Prison.

29:16.296 --> 29:19.674
He also received mail
from the warden there.

29:19.758 --> 29:20.592
Shankshaw?

29:22.093 --> 29:23.970
That's not where Lodge served time.

29:24.053 --> 29:26.473
-I'm afraid that's all I have.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.100
One more thing.

29:29.267 --> 29:30.101
A question.

29:30.935 --> 29:31.895
Miss Veronica...

29:32.979 --> 29:35.064
how is she faring through all this?

29:38.109 --> 29:39.527
So, Mr. Blossom,

29:39.903 --> 29:42.947
how does it feel being back
in Riverdale after all these years?

29:43.031 --> 29:44.991
Ignore that person, Claudius.

29:45.533 --> 29:47.660
I assumed tonight
would be family only.

29:47.744 --> 29:49.913
It's all right.
I enjoy meeting new people.

29:50.497 --> 29:55.251
During my journeys as a sailor,
I came upon the most wonderful island.

29:57.086 --> 29:59.589
-Lésbos.
-Oh, my God.

30:00.548 --> 30:04.302
It's the most beautiful
natural place on earth.

30:04.928 --> 30:09.474
You're-- You're not going back
on the boat, dear boy, are you?

30:10.058 --> 30:12.101
You're staying here with us.

30:12.185 --> 30:16.314
Whatever I can do to make sure that
you and this house are well cared for.

30:16.689 --> 30:19.859
That is, of course...
as long as I'm welcome.

30:27.784 --> 30:30.328
There's a room over the garage.

30:30.411 --> 30:34.249
It's freezing in winter and boiling
in summer, but... it's there.

30:38.044 --> 30:40.171
Lodge's master plan
has something to do

30:40.255 --> 30:42.715
with your old stomping ground,
Shankshaw.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.553
I tried calling the warden.
He hasn't called back.

30:46.636 --> 30:47.929
That corrupt son of a bitch.

30:48.012 --> 30:50.223
Do you have contacts on the inside
who might know something?

30:52.559 --> 30:53.685
Yeah, War Baby.

30:53.768 --> 30:57.313
-He knows everybody's business.

31:00.775 --> 31:04.821
Can I just say, between us,
that Chic is creepy.

31:05.280 --> 31:08.616
I don't think he likes me,
I don't think he likes the twins.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.451
A couple of times,
I've just caught him staring at us.

31:10.535 --> 31:11.828
Yeah. Tell me about it.

31:12.203 --> 31:15.039
That's part of the reason why
I submitted a sample of Chic's blood

31:15.123 --> 31:16.916
to the lab the Blossoms set up.

31:17.166 --> 31:18.918
-<i>CSI,</i> Nancy Drew.
-Yeah.

31:19.002 --> 31:21.129
How did you get a sample of his blood?

31:22.380 --> 31:23.590
Don't worry about it.

31:23.756 --> 31:26.050
But, Polly, I think Dad may be right,

31:26.134 --> 31:30.054
that Chic's... dangerous.
Possibly not even our brother.

31:31.014 --> 31:32.223
What will we do if he's not?

31:32.307 --> 31:34.767
It'll crush Mom,
but we'll have to tell her.

31:35.685 --> 31:38.771
In a way... it may kind of be a relief.

31:43.735 --> 31:44.777
Hey, you're home.

31:45.194 --> 31:49.490
Yeah, and Polly just spent her Blossom
inheritance on silk headbands. Ha, ha.

31:49.574 --> 31:51.910
Shh. Betty, keep your voice down,

31:51.993 --> 31:53.578
however Mom got Juniper
and Dagwood to sleep,

31:53.661 --> 31:54.954
I do not want them waking up.

31:55.038 --> 31:57.332
They're not home.

31:57.916 --> 32:00.168
-They're with Chic.

32:02.545 --> 32:03.880
He wanted to take
his niece and nephew

32:03.963 --> 32:05.506
for a walk along Sweetwater River.

32:10.094 --> 32:13.640
How could you let
a complete stranger take my babies?

32:13.723 --> 32:17.226
He's not a stranger, he's your brother.
And he's doing something nice for you.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.228
Yeah, the hell he is.

32:21.522 --> 32:23.149
What did you do to my babies?

32:24.025 --> 32:25.068
Nothing, Polly.

32:25.652 --> 32:26.486
They're fine.

32:35.411 --> 32:36.746
What's up, Jonesy?

32:36.829 --> 32:39.165
You want me to knock some heads
in here for you?

32:39.248 --> 32:41.042
No, War Baby, we need intel.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.963
Heard about anything major
going on behind the scenes?

32:45.046 --> 32:48.383
Maybe to do with a guy named Hiram.
Hiram Lodge.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.718
You're like Dracula.

32:51.594 --> 32:54.555
He bought property all over London
so he could move his vampire kingdom

32:54.639 --> 32:55.932
over from Transylvania.

32:56.599 --> 32:59.143
Except you're bringing
organized crime to Riverdale.

32:59.227 --> 33:02.897
And you want my dad to be mayor
so he can be your patsy. Except...

33:03.439 --> 33:05.566
what if you and him
don't see eye to eye on something?

33:05.650 --> 33:08.194
What an imagination you have.

33:09.278 --> 33:11.739
-This is my journal.

33:12.281 --> 33:14.909
When Mrs. Lodge sent
that fake FBI agent to test me,

33:14.993 --> 33:17.620
I started taking detailed notes
of everything I saw

33:17.704 --> 33:19.080
while I was apprenticing with you.

33:19.163 --> 33:20.581
Is that a threat?

33:20.832 --> 33:22.750
I'm looking out for my family.  Archie...

33:27.880 --> 33:30.675
I believe your father
and I will make a great team.

33:30.883 --> 33:32.468
Moreover, in 18 months...

33:32.885 --> 33:35.805
Lodge Industries will be
100 percent legitimate.

33:35.888 --> 33:38.182
Riverdale will be virtually crime free.

33:38.516 --> 33:41.102
The safest small town in America.

33:43.062 --> 33:45.023
Or am I not
inner

33:45.106 --> 33:46.774
Everything will become clear soon.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.193
I'm just asking for you to trust me.

33:49.277 --> 33:51.988
Forget about me, this is my dad
we're talking about.

33:52.071 --> 33:54.991
We will all benefit from this, Archie.
I promise.

34:01.914 --> 34:03.249
I'll hold you to that.

34:04.542 --> 34:07.128
And in the meantime,
I'll keep this very close.

34:20.975 --> 34:22.643
With Jughead.

34:22.727 --> 34:23.936
Why do you ask, Polly?

34:24.437 --> 34:25.438
I...

34:26.355 --> 34:29.192
I-- I'm going, Mom.

34:32.361 --> 34:33.821
Chic said it would only be
a matter of time

34:33.905 --> 34:35.073
before you left us for the Farm again.

34:35.156 --> 34:38.159
I'm not going to the Farm, Mom.
I'm driving West.

34:38.242 --> 34:41.621
-San Francisco, maybe.
-That's a nice city. I've been there.

34:42.246 --> 34:44.499
It's safe, too. Safe for the kids.

34:47.168 --> 34:49.378
Will you are least let me say goodbye
to my grandtwins?

34:49.462 --> 34:50.797
Of course.

34:54.133 --> 34:57.762
Drop us a note with your new address
when you get there, okay?

35:13.444 --> 35:14.278
Hey.

35:17.782 --> 35:18.950
What's wrong?

35:19.617 --> 35:22.537
We just got a call from our good friend
Warden Jeffries at Shankshaw Prison.

35:22.620 --> 35:26.624
Seems Jughead and FP Jones
paid a visit to one of FP's cronies.

35:26.707 --> 35:29.669
A well-informed, loose lipped crony.

35:29.752 --> 35:32.255
We think they know.
We think they know everything.

35:32.338 --> 35:34.966
Which means it's just a matter of time
before Jughead splashes it

35:35.049 --> 35:38.219
on the front page of a newspaper.
One we do not own.

35:39.262 --> 35:40.721
Get Fred and Archie over here.

35:43.057 --> 35:45.601
Hiram Lodge is diabolically insane.

35:45.685 --> 35:46.519
Agreed.

35:47.061 --> 35:49.772
We need to show Riverdale
just how insane he is.

35:51.941 --> 35:54.902
This is the best thing
you've ever written, Jug.

35:55.361 --> 35:58.948
Principal Weatherbee needs
to publish this right the hell now.

35:59.031 --> 35:59.866
Let's go.

36:00.283 --> 36:03.119
Jughead Jones
may be about to break a story.

36:04.704 --> 36:08.791
A story about my plans for Riverdale.
And rather than hear it from him...

36:08.875 --> 36:10.918
I think it's only right
that you hear it from me.

36:11.294 --> 36:14.172
-This is quite a story, Mr. Jones.
-Thank you, Principal Weatherbee.

36:14.255 --> 36:17.008
Unfortunately, it's not one
that the <i>Blue and Gold</i> can print.

36:17.592 --> 36:18.551
Why the heck not?

36:18.718 --> 36:20.720
A malicious take-down
of one of our student's parents

36:20.803 --> 36:23.472
is not appropriate subject matter
for a school paper.

36:24.056 --> 36:25.433
Now, if you'll both excuse me.

36:28.519 --> 36:29.562
You're serious?

36:29.937 --> 36:32.773
Southside High is gonna be
turned into--

36:32.857 --> 36:35.276
A private, for-profit prison.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.905
Yeah, built on the bones
of a high school.

36:39.071 --> 36:40.656
What the hell
have we been building at SoDale?

36:40.740 --> 36:42.867
What we've said all along: housing.

36:42.950 --> 36:45.536
For all the people
who will work at the prison.

36:45.620 --> 36:48.164
And you expect me
to support this as mayor?

36:48.247 --> 36:51.042
We were hoping
you'd be open to it, yes.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.045
I can't do it. I'm out of here.

36:54.587 --> 36:55.463
Look, Fred--

36:55.546 --> 36:57.548
We've been in business for how long
and you didn't tell me?

36:57.632 --> 37:00.343
Only reason you're telling me now
is it's about to become public. -I'll admit, it's not ideal.

37:03.221 --> 37:06.807
You wanna turn the town that I love,
my home, my son's home,

37:06.891 --> 37:08.434
into a prison.

37:10.895 --> 37:15.399
Fred, please. Let me tell you why
and how this is the right move for us.

37:15.483 --> 37:16.817
-For Riverdale.
-You just save that

37:16.901 --> 37:18.861
for whoever it is
that you find to run for mayor

37:18.945 --> 37:21.656
because we are leaving
and we are leaving now.

37:22.156 --> 37:23.282
Come on, Archie.

37:23.991 --> 37:25.368
Dad, I'm gonna stay.

37:27.912 --> 37:28.996
Excuse me?

37:29.080 --> 37:31.707
I wanna stay. I wanna hear
what Mr. Lodge has to say.

37:34.043 --> 37:36.379
Then I will see you at home, then.

37:58.025 --> 37:59.819
Thank you all for coming.

38:01.654 --> 38:03.864
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...

38:04.824 --> 38:06.784
your next mayor of Riverdale...

38:08.494 --> 38:10.246
my mother, Hermione Lodge.

38:17.169 --> 38:20.006
Thank you, Veronica.
And thank you all very much. <i>Like many of you,</i>
<i>I grew up in this town...</i>

38:24.051 --> 38:25.845
<i>dreaming of a better tomorrow.</i>

38:26.220 --> 38:29.557
<i>For myself, my family</i>
<i>and for my friends.</i>

38:31.559 --> 38:32.393
<i>And now...</i>

38:33.394 --> 38:36.439
<i>for the future that you all so deserve.</i>

38:38.816 --> 38:43.070
<i>Riverdale is one of the most</i>
<i>dynamic, resilient communities...</i>

38:43.154 --> 38:44.071
The Lodges.

38:45.031 --> 38:47.742
How often have I dreamt
of getting my revenge on them.

38:47.825 --> 38:49.076
Now, now, Claudius.

38:50.036 --> 38:51.162
First things first.

38:53.122 --> 38:55.875
Nana... then Cheryl.

38:55.958 --> 38:57.293
Of course, Penelope.

38:57.918 --> 38:59.795
Our house must be put in order.

39:00.254 --> 39:03.299
<i>Riverdale cannot succeed</i>
<i>unless all of us succeed.</i>

39:03.591 --> 39:06.635
<i>And that will require certain sacrifices.</i>

39:10.139 --> 39:11.682
What

39:12.725 --> 39:15.561
When you wouldn't submit
to the DNA test,

39:15.644 --> 39:18.939
I found some of your dental floss
and sent it to the lab.

39:19.398 --> 39:20.858
Those are the results.

39:23.027 --> 39:25.237
You're not who you say you are, Chic.

39:26.322 --> 39:28.699
So... who are you?

39:29.325 --> 39:32.620
<i>We'll also need your support.</i>
<i>We'll need your trust.</i>

39:33.120 --> 39:34.538
<i>We'll need your loyalty.</i>

39:35.581 --> 39:38.042
I knew a prison
would be a difficult sell.

39:39.752 --> 39:41.420
Especially with Fred.

39:42.296 --> 39:44.465
I was gonna ease him into the idea.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.052
I should have told you both sooner.

39:48.844 --> 39:50.012
I regret that.

39:50.596 --> 39:55.017
To be honest, Mr. Lodge...
before Jason, before the Black Hood...

39:56.644 --> 39:58.229
before my dad was shot...

39:59.855 --> 40:02.566
I might not have understood
your point of view.

40:03.442 --> 40:04.568
But I've changed.

40:04.985 --> 40:07.279
I think Riverdale
needs a change, too.

40:07.863 --> 40:08.697
Yeah.

40:11.158 --> 40:12.284
This tradition...

40:13.702 --> 40:15.204
has been in my family...

40:16.455 --> 40:18.082
going back generations.

40:18.541 --> 40:19.375
It's a...

40:20.751 --> 40:22.002
It's a sign of loyalty.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.088
Once you do this...

40:25.005 --> 40:26.340
there's no undoing it.

40:27.341 --> 40:28.759
No changing your mind.

40:31.262 --> 40:32.513
So, are you certain?

40:34.265 --> 40:35.141
I think... I am.

41:08.716 --> 41:10.718
You know what you need to do.

41:25.983 --> 41:27.026
Now, Archie...

41:30.070 --> 41:31.071
we come first.

41:33.574 --> 41:37.161
This town has endured so much
these past few years.

41:38.162 --> 41:39.955
After so much adversity...

41:40.915 --> 41:45.294
aren't we all ready
for a taste of prosperity?

41:50.424 --> 41:53.135
<i>And there it was.</i>
<i>The Lodges had won.</i> <i>Time had run out for Riverdale.</i>
