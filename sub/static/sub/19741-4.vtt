WEBVTT

00:00.050 --> 00:01.393
Previously on "The Catch"...

00:01.396 --> 00:03.625
The only reason I took this FBI deal

00:03.628 --> 00:05.147
was so that you and I could be together

00:05.149 --> 00:06.114
by the end of it.

00:06.116 --> 00:07.549
Someone is trying to kill me.

00:07.552 --> 00:08.652
He's called "The Hammer."

00:08.655 --> 00:10.382
I get hired and paid anonymously.

00:10.385 --> 00:12.287
This is the woman who wants you dead.

00:12.289 --> 00:14.389
Poor B-Team. Can't you do
anything without my help?

00:14.392 --> 00:15.992
What is my name?

00:17.428 --> 00:18.760
What happened? Where were you?

00:18.762 --> 00:20.095
I was with Tommy.

00:20.097 --> 00:21.864
You're engaged to a con man?

00:21.866 --> 00:22.607
Mm-hmm.

00:22.610 --> 00:25.467
I guess it makes sense, given Ethan.

00:25.469 --> 00:26.735
Ethan was a mistake.

00:26.737 --> 00:27.903
The overseas account

00:27.905 --> 00:29.071
was opened in Tommy's name

00:29.073 --> 00:30.506
by his former employers.

00:30.508 --> 00:32.975
I have access to $3 million.

00:32.977 --> 00:34.643
So, how can we help you, Mr...?

00:34.645 --> 00:35.477
Tasker.

00:35.479 --> 00:36.734
I'm looking for someone

00:36.737 --> 00:38.280
who stole from me and my associates.

00:38.282 --> 00:40.048
Let's get you your money, then.

00:40.050 --> 00:43.118
- Were you running drugs for them?
- God, no!

00:43.120 --> 00:45.554
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

00:45.556 --> 00:48.156
Don't do this! Please, I'm begging you!

00:48.158 --> 00:50.325
So, our mysterious diamond smuggler...

00:50.327 --> 00:51.426
Do we know who she is yet?

00:51.428 --> 00:53.328
Our big bad is a diplomat.

00:53.330 --> 00:54.596
My mom's not the diamond broker.

00:54.598 --> 00:55.573
I am.

00:55.576 --> 00:57.726
And you're going to tell
me what you did with Kenji,

00:57.729 --> 00:59.968
or Yumi here is going to kill you.

00:59.970 --> 01:02.738
I can get you $3 million in cash.

01:02.740 --> 01:03.805
I'm gonna need some collateral.

01:03.807 --> 01:04.973
Aah!

01:04.974 --> 01:07.709
It would be a shame if
he died from the toxin

01:07.711 --> 01:08.877
before you got him to the hospital.

01:08.879 --> 01:10.345
Rhys stole Tommy's money.

01:10.347 --> 01:11.713
If you don't give it to
me, Rhys is gonna die.

01:11.715 --> 01:13.882
But if I don't give it to
them, Tommy's gonna die.

01:13.884 --> 01:15.492
Allie, Allie...

01:23.494 --> 01:25.294
I'll flip you for it. Heads or tails?

01:25.296 --> 01:26.762
I thought you said
Rhys' life was as stake.

01:26.764 --> 01:28.096
How else are we gonna decide this?

01:28.098 --> 01:29.880
We're not gonna shoot each other.

01:29.883 --> 01:30.832
Are we?

01:32.536 --> 01:35.003
Look, technically,

01:35.005 --> 01:36.538
this money belongs to
the Southland Cartel.

01:36.540 --> 01:38.173
Are you really gonna
defend the property rights

01:38.175 --> 01:39.408
of drug dealers right now?

01:39.410 --> 01:40.909
Yes, because if I don't
give it back to them,

01:40.911 --> 01:42.044
they're gonna kill my baby brother.

01:42.046 --> 01:43.145
What's the clock on that?

01:43.147 --> 01:44.279
Because Rhys has been
stabbed and poisoned

01:44.281 --> 01:45.581
by a 20-year-old diamond smuggler,

01:45.583 --> 01:46.915
and I don't know how
much time he's got left.

01:46.917 --> 01:48.617
The FBI can't take down a 20-year-old?

01:48.619 --> 01:50.719
He's a diplomat's ki...
It's a whole thing.

01:50.721 --> 01:52.487
Because I have an entire
army of drug dealers

01:52.489 --> 01:54.323
who have promised to kill
me and everyone I know

01:54.325 --> 01:55.524
if I don't give this back to them.

01:55.526 --> 01:56.566
Wait, they threatened you?

01:57.895 --> 01:58.727
Of course.

01:58.729 --> 01:59.728
Well, why didn't you say that?

01:59.730 --> 02:00.829
Because I didn't want you to worry.

02:00.831 --> 02:01.439
Oh, Allie.

02:01.442 --> 02:02.841
No, it's fine. I'll be fine.

02:02.844 --> 02:04.566
Just go. Go right now.

02:04.568 --> 02:06.234
What are you gonna do?

02:06.236 --> 02:07.269
I'll figure it out.

02:07.271 --> 02:08.870
I don't want Rhys to die.

02:08.872 --> 02:09.972
I don't either,

02:09.973 --> 02:12.074
but I also don't have
$3 million lying around.

02:14.044 --> 02:15.644
What?

02:15.646 --> 02:17.811
I know someone who does.

02:17.814 --> 02:20.148
You know someone who has
$3 million lying around?

02:20.150 --> 02:21.858
So do you.

02:23.220 --> 02:24.987
Alice. Was I expecting you?

02:24.989 --> 02:27.122
No, and I brought someone with me.

02:27.124 --> 02:28.323
I thought we'd moved past the need

02:28.325 --> 02:29.291
for supervised visits.

02:29.293 --> 02:30.826
- May we come in?
- That depends.

02:30.828 --> 02:32.294
Is it Danny?

02:32.296 --> 02:35.230
It's not Danny.

02:39.090 --> 02:43.305
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

02:44.675 --> 02:46.375
- You lied to me.
- I didn't lie.

02:46.377 --> 02:48.276
If it makes you feel any
better, she lied to me, too.

02:48.278 --> 02:49.678
There was no overt lying involved.

02:49.680 --> 02:50.579
I was very careful.

02:50.581 --> 02:52.576
You said Ben was still in jail.

02:52.579 --> 02:53.882
You said you weren't going after Margot.

02:53.884 --> 02:54.783
I wasn't.

02:54.785 --> 02:55.817
You were going after me?

02:55.819 --> 02:56.852
How are you two working together?

02:56.854 --> 02:58.253
How are you working for the FBI?

02:58.255 --> 02:59.855
Oh, are you upset she didn't tell you

02:59.857 --> 03:01.089
or that I'm not still in jail?

03:01.091 --> 03:02.257
Either. Both.

03:02.259 --> 03:03.992
May I remind you that we're on a clock?

03:03.994 --> 03:05.261
Your brother's life is in danger.

03:05.263 --> 03:06.473
Yes, I know. So is mine.

03:06.476 --> 03:07.596
No, this is something else.

03:07.599 --> 03:08.628
Wait, what is she talking about?

03:08.630 --> 03:09.563
You didn't tell him?

03:09.566 --> 03:10.899
Of course I didn't tell him...

03:10.901 --> 03:12.267
- Client confidentiality.
- Tell me what?

03:12.269 --> 03:13.902
- There isn't time!
- Why not?

03:13.904 --> 03:16.338
Because if you don't give
Ben $3 million in cash,

03:16.340 --> 03:17.673
Rhys is going to die.

03:21.945 --> 03:24.212
You're making a huge mistake.

03:24.214 --> 03:26.481
I'm not the one who drove
Kenji out of the country.

03:26.483 --> 03:28.316
Oh, we did you a favor.

03:28.318 --> 03:30.018
Look, if you really want to succeed,

03:30.020 --> 03:31.720
you need partners with experience...

03:31.722 --> 03:33.388
Partners who don't spook easily.

03:34.427 --> 03:35.658
That's the fugu.

03:35.661 --> 03:37.693
If your partner doesn't
show with the $3 million...

03:37.695 --> 03:38.860
$3 million's nothing.

03:38.862 --> 03:40.062
Look, get me an EpiPen.

03:40.064 --> 03:42.698
We'll... We'll make
at least 10 times that.

03:44.134 --> 03:45.467
Oh, bloody hell.

03:45.469 --> 03:46.802
Yeah, looks like your time is up.

03:48.806 --> 03:51.640
Well, it's your loss.

03:53.177 --> 03:56.845
If I die, you miss out
on the deal of a lifetime.

03:56.847 --> 03:57.713
Oh!

04:00.584 --> 04:02.017
Aw, baby.

04:02.019 --> 04:03.118
What did you do that for?

04:03.120 --> 04:04.886
I think we should hear him out, babes.

04:04.888 --> 04:07.355
And if you don't like what he says...

04:08.358 --> 04:09.658
...we can always kill him.

04:11.328 --> 04:13.495
You heard the lady.

04:13.497 --> 04:15.530
Start talking.

04:20.904 --> 04:22.304
So, where did Alice run off to?

04:22.306 --> 04:24.840
Believe it or not, she's trying
to save her brother's life.

04:24.842 --> 04:26.208
That can't be a coincidence.

04:26.210 --> 04:27.609
Oh, it's not. It's Rhys.

04:27.611 --> 04:30.112
Makes you wonder if he's
worth $3 million plus interest.

04:30.114 --> 04:31.279
You're charging interest

04:31.281 --> 04:32.581
on your own brother's life?

04:32.583 --> 04:33.782
He'd do the same to me.

04:33.784 --> 04:35.318
Justine?

04:35.321 --> 04:36.885
Ah, another woman already.

04:36.887 --> 04:38.420
You didn't have to count it twice.

04:38.422 --> 04:40.856
You're right. Three times is better.

04:40.858 --> 04:42.290
Can't really talk right now.

04:42.292 --> 04:44.493
I think our friend, the
Consul General of Japan,

04:44.495 --> 04:45.460
is an alcoholic.

04:45.462 --> 04:46.428
What makes you say that?

04:46.430 --> 04:47.562
'Cause she just confessed

04:47.564 --> 04:49.898
to every imaginable indiscretion

04:49.900 --> 04:51.366
except diamond-smuggling.

04:51.368 --> 04:53.433
And then she kissed me.

04:53.436 --> 04:55.036
Wow, Rhys is gonna be
sorry he missed that.

04:55.038 --> 04:56.438
Oh, and then she threw up on me.

04:56.440 --> 04:57.939
She ate a lot of sushi.

04:57.941 --> 04:59.808
Kohana's not our smuggler.

05:01.845 --> 05:02.878
Jesse is.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.546
What? Since when?

05:04.548 --> 05:05.981
Since the minute you left the party.

05:05.983 --> 05:06.915
Well, where is he now?

05:06.917 --> 05:07.816
Where are you?

05:07.818 --> 05:08.984
Don't worry about it.

05:08.986 --> 05:09.951
I've got this.

05:09.953 --> 05:11.253
No, I've got this.

05:11.255 --> 05:13.155
Jesse doesn't have diplomatic immunity.

05:13.157 --> 05:14.990
If we can get proof, I can arrest him.

05:14.992 --> 05:16.091
I'm gonna have to call you back.

05:17.761 --> 05:19.461
$3 million.

05:19.463 --> 05:20.896
Plus interest.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:44.121 --> 05:45.921
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:45.923 --> 05:46.922
What's wrong?

05:46.924 --> 05:49.191
We had to charge Tommy.

05:49.193 --> 05:51.159
What? For what?

05:51.161 --> 05:53.094
For the murder of the Kincaids.

05:54.231 --> 05:55.897
Nick!

05:55.899 --> 05:57.532
You were holding him to protect him!

05:57.534 --> 05:58.533
When the DA found out,

05:58.535 --> 05:59.801
there was too much evidence to...

05:59.803 --> 06:00.902
Eviden... What evidence?

06:00.904 --> 06:02.103
His fingerprints were
all over the house.

06:02.105 --> 06:03.371
Because he worked for the Kincaids.

06:03.373 --> 06:05.006
And the $3 million they put in his name

06:05.008 --> 06:06.608
gave him motive.

06:06.610 --> 06:08.443
My brother did not kill the Kincaids.

06:08.446 --> 06:09.310
He knows that.

06:09.313 --> 06:10.779
Theo Tasker killed the Kincaids.

06:10.781 --> 06:12.113
And we will prove that.

06:12.115 --> 06:13.582
We'll get Tommy out.

06:13.584 --> 06:15.016
And in the meantime,

06:15.018 --> 06:17.185
your brother will be
safe in custody overnight.

06:17.187 --> 06:19.221
Yeah, because nothing bad
ever happens to people in jail.

06:19.223 --> 06:20.989
You have my word.

06:26.930 --> 06:28.597
Rhys!

06:28.599 --> 06:29.464
Benji!

06:30.500 --> 06:31.900
Just in time for dessert.

06:31.902 --> 06:33.535
I thought you were dying.

06:33.537 --> 06:34.970
I was.

06:34.972 --> 06:37.873
But I got better, thanks
to our new partners.

06:37.875 --> 06:38.907
Our... partners?

06:38.909 --> 06:40.475
Yeah. You know Jesse.

06:40.477 --> 06:42.711
And this is Yumi.

06:42.713 --> 06:44.678
I was the one holding
the gun on you earlier.

06:44.681 --> 06:46.181
Yes, of course.

06:46.183 --> 06:47.349
While you were away,

06:47.351 --> 06:49.317
I explained the
particulars of our pitch.

06:49.319 --> 06:51.186
You know, ramping up
the restaurant as cover,

06:51.188 --> 06:53.488
using our suppliers to move the product.

06:53.490 --> 06:55.624
Anyway...

06:55.626 --> 06:57.459
$3 million, or thereabouts.

06:57.461 --> 06:59.570
That should cover our buy-in.

06:59.573 --> 07:00.929
Oh, so we're officially...?

07:00.931 --> 07:02.697
In the diamond business.

07:02.699 --> 07:04.366
Here's to new friendships,

07:04.368 --> 07:07.510
good fortune, and giant fish.

07:19.549 --> 07:22.517
Yes, I'd like to report a break-in.

07:22.519 --> 07:24.753
Put down the phone, Allie.

07:24.755 --> 07:26.655
Tommy?

07:30.060 --> 07:31.860
Hang up the phone.

07:31.862 --> 07:34.262
I'm sorry, there's been a mistake.

07:34.264 --> 07:35.730
Everything's fine.

07:36.733 --> 07:38.266
You're supposed to be in jail.

07:38.268 --> 07:39.100
Yeah.

07:39.102 --> 07:41.569
Yeah, I know. Yeah.

07:41.571 --> 07:43.138
Y-You put me there.

07:43.140 --> 07:45.106
So you'd be safe.

07:47.177 --> 07:49.945
Where is the money?

07:49.947 --> 07:51.079
Tommy, listen to me.

07:53.650 --> 07:57.319
I said, where is the money?

08:02.623 --> 08:03.989
Where is the money?

08:07.374 --> 08:08.507
Where'd you get a gun?

08:08.509 --> 08:09.908
Allie...

08:09.910 --> 08:11.076
where is the money?

08:11.078 --> 08:13.712
Why? You gonna run away again?

08:13.714 --> 08:15.280
Because that almost got you killed.

08:15.282 --> 08:19.184
Yeah, well, better dead
than a life in prison

08:19.186 --> 08:20.886
for something that I didn't do!

08:20.888 --> 08:22.254
That argument might play better

08:22.256 --> 08:23.889
if you weren't waving a gun in my face.

08:23.891 --> 08:25.524
The gun's not for you. It's for Tasker.

08:25.526 --> 08:30.329
Which is why I asked Nick
to keep you safe in holding.

08:30.331 --> 08:33.799
He charged me with a double homicide.

08:33.801 --> 08:35.833
I know.

08:37.203 --> 08:38.683
What I don't know is how you got out.

08:43.294 --> 08:45.261
No.

08:45.264 --> 08:47.979
Well, I didn't know who else to call.

08:47.981 --> 08:49.681
You did this on purpose.

08:49.683 --> 08:50.682
He's the only person I know

08:50.684 --> 08:52.084
who had enough money
to post for my bail.

08:52.086 --> 08:54.353
You wouldn't even know
Ethan if it wasn't for me!

08:54.355 --> 08:56.888
He's not the same guy anymore.

08:56.890 --> 09:00.058
If he does you a favor, it
means I owe him now!

09:00.060 --> 09:01.393
Do you understand that?

09:01.395 --> 09:03.261
Won't be like that this time.

09:03.263 --> 09:04.296
You don't know him!

09:04.298 --> 09:07.532
You don't... know him like I know him.

09:12.706 --> 09:14.639
We're working with Ethan now?

09:14.641 --> 09:16.775
No, Tommy called him on his own.

09:16.777 --> 09:18.799
I'm pretending I don't
even know about it.

09:18.802 --> 09:20.468
That's between the two of them.

09:20.471 --> 09:22.848
You think he's texting him right now?

09:22.850 --> 09:24.950
Probably.

09:24.952 --> 09:26.651
Ethan already gave him bail money.

09:26.653 --> 09:29.254
He's not about to get mixed
up with the Southland Cartel.

09:29.256 --> 09:30.188
I don't know.

09:30.190 --> 09:32.591
Ethan is very well-connected.

09:32.593 --> 09:34.760
But he's very high-profile now.

09:34.762 --> 09:36.895
He owns most of the
commercial real estate in town.

09:36.897 --> 09:38.864
He's friends with the
mayor, with the DA.

09:38.866 --> 09:41.433
He's not about to get
his hands dirty with this.

09:41.435 --> 09:43.735
Look, we're gonna figure it out.

09:43.737 --> 09:46.605
We've got the cops, we've got Nick.

09:46.607 --> 09:48.140
We don't need Ethan.

10:03.323 --> 10:05.357
I can park him in the security wing

10:05.359 --> 10:06.559
if he makes you uncomfortable.

10:07.828 --> 10:10.228
He's fine. I'm fine.

10:13.767 --> 10:15.434
You know, I'm gonna
move him to reception

10:15.436 --> 10:16.835
so you don't have to look at him.

10:16.837 --> 10:19.070
I don't need your help with this.

10:25.179 --> 10:27.245
Sophie, I'm sorry.

10:27.247 --> 10:28.280
Don't.

10:28.282 --> 10:30.348
All anyone here wanted
to do was help you,

10:30.350 --> 10:34.186
and all you've done is
lie and put us all at risk.

10:34.188 --> 10:37.055
I know. That's why I
bought you those earrings...

10:37.057 --> 10:37.956
You know, to apologize.

10:37.958 --> 10:39.458
I don't need you to apologize.

10:39.460 --> 10:42.727
I need you to step up,
stop lying, and fix this.

10:47.501 --> 10:49.835
I mean, I'm not saying I'm
an American hero or anything.

10:49.837 --> 10:52.133
That's good, 'cause you're
neither an American nor a hero.

10:52.136 --> 10:54.670
Which makes my sacrifice for
this country all the greater.

10:54.673 --> 10:57.674
But do I ask for sympathy or gratitude?

10:57.676 --> 10:59.142
- Yes, you do.
- Constantly.

10:59.144 --> 11:00.310
How about some coffee instead?

11:00.312 --> 11:01.345
Oh, well, thank you.

11:01.347 --> 11:02.346
At least somebody cares about me.

11:02.348 --> 11:03.347
I do.

11:03.349 --> 11:05.315
I've invested a lot in you two.

11:05.317 --> 11:06.350
Thank you.

11:06.352 --> 11:07.417
Which will finally pay off

11:07.419 --> 11:09.486
when we take down Jesse's operation.

11:09.488 --> 11:11.885
Jesse and Yumi's operation.
They're in this thing together.

11:11.888 --> 11:13.523
Which one do you think is in charge...

11:13.525 --> 11:14.758
Jesse or Yumi?

11:14.760 --> 11:15.993
You don't think men and women

11:15.995 --> 11:17.890
are capable of being
equals in a relationship?

11:17.893 --> 11:19.363
I'd like to think so.

11:19.365 --> 11:21.131
But there's always one person

11:21.133 --> 11:23.533
who's a little bit more
in love than the other.

11:23.535 --> 11:26.169
The other is the one with the power.

11:26.171 --> 11:29.239
And would your husband agree with that?

11:29.241 --> 11:32.009
I mean, you do have a husband, right?

11:32.011 --> 11:35.579
I mean, although there's no
ring and we've yet to meet him.

11:35.581 --> 11:36.380
Why is that?

11:36.383 --> 11:39.216
If you ever meet him, you can ask him.

11:39.218 --> 11:40.884
Oh, that's not really fair.

11:40.886 --> 11:42.352
You know everything about us.

11:42.354 --> 11:43.474
We know nothing about you.

11:43.477 --> 11:45.689
That's because we're not
equals in this relationship.

11:45.691 --> 11:47.124
You work for me.

11:48.827 --> 11:53.230
So, tomorrow you will
re-open Kenji's restaurant.

11:53.232 --> 11:56.133
You will sign for the giant bluefin.

11:56.135 --> 11:57.701
And when Jesse and Yumi
come for the diamonds,

11:57.703 --> 11:59.836
the FBI will be there to show them

11:59.838 --> 12:03.340
who really has the
power in this relationship.

12:07.312 --> 12:08.879
This is the footage from the bank,

12:08.881 --> 12:10.113
and this is the woman

12:10.115 --> 12:12.362
who paid to put the hit
out on Margot Bishop.

12:12.365 --> 12:13.750
What do we know about her?

12:13.752 --> 12:14.818
We know she's a pro...

12:14.820 --> 12:16.553
She never once looks up at the camera.

12:16.555 --> 12:18.622
She did, however, leave
her bag open long enough

12:18.624 --> 12:21.758
for us to see hand sanitizer,
a 45-caliber handgun,

12:21.761 --> 12:22.790
and a hotel-room key.

12:22.793 --> 12:24.528
So she's just visiting L.A.

12:24.530 --> 12:25.762
But it's the back of the key card,

12:25.764 --> 12:28.498
so you can't tell where she's staying.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.767
Doesn't matter.

12:30.769 --> 12:33.437
That bag is the only clue we need.

12:33.439 --> 12:34.938
What do you mean?

12:34.940 --> 12:39.009
That is a white Himalayan-crocodile
René Mancini bag.

12:39.011 --> 12:41.278
It's worth at least 300 grand.

12:41.280 --> 12:44.848
It was stolen from a shop
on Rodeo Drive two days ago.

12:44.850 --> 12:46.616
And it wasn't our mystery
woman's only score.

12:46.618 --> 12:48.018
Danny?

12:48.020 --> 12:49.119
Uh, sorry?

12:49.121 --> 12:50.253
The other thefts.

12:50.255 --> 12:51.421
There were other thefts?

12:51.423 --> 12:55.959
Yes, there were...
Three stores in two days.

12:55.961 --> 12:58.128
The dress was taken from Versace,

12:58.130 --> 13:01.732
the necklace from Chanel,
and the hat from Gu-ucci.

13:01.734 --> 13:03.967
Why would a woman
who paid me a million dollars

13:03.969 --> 13:05.235
go shoplifting?

13:05.237 --> 13:07.003
Uh, same reason she would
pay on the dark web...

13:07.005 --> 13:08.071
No cash trail.

13:08.073 --> 13:09.806
But she did leave a clue trail,

13:09.808 --> 13:11.608
which is why we're
gonna canvass the area,

13:11.610 --> 13:12.943
show her photo to people,

13:12.945 --> 13:14.544
find out if anyone's ever seen her.

13:14.546 --> 13:18.281
Well, much as I would love to join you,

13:18.283 --> 13:20.050
I am having a bit of a software issue

13:20.052 --> 13:21.284
back at the hotel.

13:21.286 --> 13:23.553
So, perhaps you could
lend me Danny or someone...

13:23.555 --> 13:24.988
- I can go.
- Danny's fine.

13:24.990 --> 13:26.823
I'll send him back as
soon as I'm done with him.

13:26.825 --> 13:28.759
In the meantime, you could
take The Hammer with you.

13:28.761 --> 13:29.626
I'm happy to help.

13:29.628 --> 13:30.994
Great. Well, that's settled.

13:30.996 --> 13:31.962
Come along, Daniel.

13:34.500 --> 13:35.365
Okay.

13:36.700 --> 13:37.901
So, I was thinking.

13:37.903 --> 13:39.302
Can you help or something?

13:39.304 --> 13:40.670
Yeah.

13:40.672 --> 13:43.006
Just lift up on your end.

13:43.008 --> 13:44.274
About the diamonds...

13:44.276 --> 13:45.509
There's bound to be loads of them,

13:45.511 --> 13:46.676
isn't there, in a fish this big?

13:46.678 --> 13:48.645
So, who would know, really,

13:48.647 --> 13:51.615
if a few of them got
lost in translation?

13:51.617 --> 13:53.683
You don't think that Jesse and Yumi know

13:53.685 --> 13:54.818
exactly how many diamonds are in there?

13:54.820 --> 13:55.986
Can you give me the knife, please?

13:55.988 --> 13:58.688
Yeah, I'm sure they
do. But Justine doesn't.

13:58.690 --> 14:00.190
I thought you liked Justine.

14:00.192 --> 14:01.224
I adore Justine.

14:01.226 --> 14:02.692
She knows we're criminals.

14:02.694 --> 14:04.561
She probably expects
us to steal from her.

14:04.563 --> 14:06.229
She'd be disappointed if we didn't.

14:09.101 --> 14:10.634
Well, then, she's gonna be disappointed,

14:10.636 --> 14:11.868
because somebody beat us to it.

14:11.870 --> 14:13.370
What are you talking about?

14:13.372 --> 14:15.105
The diamonds are gone.

14:18.283 --> 14:19.382
Bollocks!

15:14.498 --> 15:16.164
Where do you think you're going?

15:16.166 --> 15:18.767
I'm going to catch the woman
who's trying to kill you.

15:18.769 --> 15:20.501
I have other people for that.

15:21.543 --> 15:23.038
You're not going anywhere.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.228
If I don't show up, they're
gonna get suspicious.

15:25.231 --> 15:25.962
Fine.

15:25.965 --> 15:28.410
But this stays with me.

15:40.491 --> 15:41.523
No.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.164
Where the hell are my diamonds?

15:49.166 --> 15:50.332
Where the hell are your manners?

15:50.334 --> 15:51.700
They're not even here, are they?

15:51.702 --> 15:53.034
You stashed them in the Rectory.

15:53.036 --> 15:53.965
Get out!

15:53.968 --> 15:55.670
I will when you give
me my diamonds back.

15:55.672 --> 15:56.771
Your diamonds?

15:56.773 --> 15:57.874
They looked like they
were about to become

15:57.876 --> 15:59.240
the U.S. government's diamonds.

15:59.242 --> 16:00.375
Now they're mine.

16:00.377 --> 16:03.319
So you can consider your
$3 million debt repaid

16:03.322 --> 16:04.287
with interest.

16:04.290 --> 16:06.424
The FBI will think I stole them.

16:06.426 --> 16:07.358
Good!

16:07.360 --> 16:08.926
Maybe they'll put you back in jail,

16:08.928 --> 16:10.128
where you belong!

16:10.130 --> 16:11.996
Okay, well, maybe we'll
make you our next target.

16:11.998 --> 16:13.461
Oh, do it.

16:13.464 --> 16:15.967
Do it, and see if I don't
bring you down with me,

16:15.969 --> 16:16.968
or have you forgotten

16:16.970 --> 16:18.569
we built this whole thing together?

16:18.571 --> 16:20.104
I didn't do any of this on my own.

16:20.106 --> 16:21.139
Just give me the diamonds.

16:21.141 --> 16:23.374
We had a life together, Ben.

16:23.376 --> 16:25.309
We were going to have a future together.

16:25.311 --> 16:27.211
And then you chose her.

16:27.213 --> 16:30.181
So, yes, I stole your diamonds,

16:30.183 --> 16:33.851
but that is nothing compared
to what you've stolen from me.

16:33.853 --> 16:36.245
What do you want me to do?

16:38.605 --> 16:41.025
I want you to disappear.

16:41.027 --> 16:46.030
I want every moment
I wasted on you back.

16:48.635 --> 16:50.334
No, you don't.

16:52.972 --> 16:54.872
Stay away from me.

16:54.874 --> 16:56.140
Stay away from the Rectory.

17:13.092 --> 17:14.090
You okay?

17:14.093 --> 17:15.660
You need to leave.

17:15.662 --> 17:17.459
Margot.

17:17.462 --> 17:18.494
Get out.

17:32.278 --> 17:36.113
Well, Tasker, he started
out just like me...

17:36.115 --> 17:37.748
Errand boy for the cartel,

17:37.750 --> 17:39.955
delivering messages to
the dealers, you know,

17:39.958 --> 17:41.525
making sure no one was stealing.

17:41.528 --> 17:42.720
And how'd you get hooked up

17:42.723 --> 17:43.888
with the cartel in the first place?

17:43.890 --> 17:45.223
The truth is, uh,

17:45.225 --> 17:47.692
I was one of their best customers.

17:47.694 --> 17:49.193
- Hmm.
- Nothing heavy.

17:49.195 --> 17:50.795
You know, just pot.

17:50.797 --> 17:54.398
Oh, come on.

17:54.400 --> 17:57.635
You're gonna tell me that
you don't smoke anymore?

17:57.637 --> 17:59.403
Ever?

17:59.405 --> 18:02.573
So, Tasker started out as you...

18:02.575 --> 18:04.442
Mm-hmm.

18:04.444 --> 18:07.278
Then he went from cooking
books for the bosses

18:07.280 --> 18:09.780
to another top-tier lieutenant,

18:09.782 --> 18:12.783
moving cash through the
cartel's shell corporations,

18:12.785 --> 18:14.051
like the Optican Group.

18:14.053 --> 18:15.887
Do you know the names of
the other corporations?

18:15.889 --> 18:16.988
Yeah, sure, some of them.

18:16.990 --> 18:19.056
But, I mean, there are tons.

18:21.895 --> 18:23.494
Write them down, along with the names

18:23.496 --> 18:25.329
of everyone you can
remember from his crew.

18:25.331 --> 18:26.764
Alice Vaughan.

18:26.766 --> 18:28.432
We have a problem, Ms. Vaughan.

18:28.434 --> 18:30.201
My sources tell me your
brother was arrested

18:30.204 --> 18:31.498
and bailed out last night.

18:31.501 --> 18:33.138
You're still getting
your money, Mr. Tasker.

18:33.140 --> 18:34.420
Oh, I know that.

18:34.423 --> 18:36.340
What I don't know is what
Tommy may have told the cops.

18:36.342 --> 18:38.242
So I'm changing the terms of our deal.

18:38.244 --> 18:39.610
That's not how this works.

18:39.612 --> 18:41.479
4:00 P.M., the Mitchell
Parking Structure downtown.

18:41.481 --> 18:43.848
You'll bring my $3 million
and you'll bring Tommy.

18:43.850 --> 18:45.249
Absolutely not.

18:45.251 --> 18:46.350
I just want to talk to him.

18:46.352 --> 18:47.767
You want to talk to him?

18:47.770 --> 18:49.068
I have him right here.

18:49.071 --> 18:50.321
4:00 P.M., Ms. Vaughan...

18:50.323 --> 18:52.323
The money and your brother.

18:52.325 --> 18:53.491
Or I'll come to you.

18:54.794 --> 18:56.594
What'd he want now?

18:56.596 --> 18:58.596
You.

19:03.169 --> 19:04.835
I should have told you about Margot.

19:04.837 --> 19:06.037
It's okay.

19:06.039 --> 19:07.939
I don't always tell
you everything, either.

19:07.941 --> 19:09.040
You don't?

19:09.042 --> 19:10.746
See? It doesn't feel very good, does it?

19:10.749 --> 19:12.749
You would have told me
not to work with her.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.085
And I would have been right.

19:14.088 --> 19:15.546
Do you know the old saying,

19:15.548 --> 19:17.515
"Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer"?

19:17.517 --> 19:19.417
Do you know the old
saying, "You play with fire,

19:19.419 --> 19:21.419
you get burned and
then shot in the head"?

19:21.421 --> 19:22.453
You see?

19:22.455 --> 19:24.021
This is why I didn't tell you.

19:24.023 --> 19:26.290
How's it going with Tommy?

19:26.292 --> 19:30.127
Actually, I think I found a way out.

19:30.129 --> 19:31.829
Do you want to tell me about it?

19:31.831 --> 19:33.197
Yeah.

19:33.199 --> 19:36.133
That's why I'm calling.

19:36.135 --> 19:38.235
Allie.

19:38.237 --> 19:40.438
I got to go.

19:41.441 --> 19:42.607
Ethan.

19:42.609 --> 19:44.375
Hey.

19:44.377 --> 19:46.544
Hey.

19:46.546 --> 19:49.213
You look great.

19:50.249 --> 19:53.017
Thank you.

19:53.019 --> 19:55.886
Thank you for seeing
me on such short notice.

19:55.888 --> 19:57.521
No, of course.

19:57.523 --> 19:59.223
I wouldn't have come, but Tom...

19:59.225 --> 20:01.492
I know. Tommy's in trouble.

20:01.494 --> 20:04.328
You didn't have to pay his bail.

20:04.330 --> 20:06.797
I... I didn't do that for you.

20:06.799 --> 20:08.666
I did that for him.

20:08.668 --> 20:11.569
It was above and beyond.

20:11.571 --> 20:13.804
He's family.

20:16.309 --> 20:18.976
Um, the... the police charged him

20:18.978 --> 20:20.177
with a double homicide.

20:20.179 --> 20:21.212
Yeah, he told me.

20:21.214 --> 20:22.947
The evidence is purely circumstantial.

20:22.949 --> 20:25.383
It won't stand up in
court. He's innocent.

20:27.113 --> 20:28.712
So was I.

20:30.833 --> 20:32.023
This was a mistake.

20:32.025 --> 20:32.857
Wait, Allie.

20:32.859 --> 20:35.192
Allie, wait, wait.

20:37.230 --> 20:38.195
How can I help?

20:38.197 --> 20:41.432
No strings attached, I promise.

20:43.936 --> 20:46.337
Do you still have friends at the SEC?

20:53.807 --> 20:55.146
I can do this alone

20:55.148 --> 20:57.481
if you have to go assassinate people

20:57.483 --> 20:58.616
for a living.

20:58.618 --> 21:00.718
I don't do that anymore, remember?

21:00.720 --> 21:01.886
I'm a bodyguard now.

21:01.888 --> 21:02.887
Hey, why is that?

21:02.889 --> 21:04.588
You were hired to kill Margot,

21:04.590 --> 21:06.323
and now you're working for her.

21:06.325 --> 21:08.826
Are you just in it for the money?

21:08.828 --> 21:11.862
Why do you do what you do?

21:13.966 --> 21:15.766
Excuse me.

21:15.768 --> 21:17.101
Have you seen this woman?

21:17.103 --> 21:18.836
Sorry.

21:23.242 --> 21:24.875
Sir.

21:24.877 --> 21:25.877
I think you dropped this.

21:32.185 --> 21:34.018
Yeah, I have seen her.

21:34.020 --> 21:36.520
She's staying here.

21:36.522 --> 21:41.492
I don't do it for the
money, but it comes in handy.

21:41.494 --> 21:43.694
I'm texting Val.

22:07.820 --> 22:09.887
Clear.

22:09.889 --> 22:10.988
Guys...

22:16.896 --> 22:20.064
She's been studying Margot
Bishop for a long time...

22:20.066 --> 22:22.199
Tracking her movements.

22:22.201 --> 22:24.135
Along with other known associates.

23:31.981 --> 23:34.630
The good news is we
tracked her to her hotel.

23:34.633 --> 23:35.646
Yeah, we have her prints

23:35.649 --> 23:38.418
on a mountain of recon she
did on you and the Firm.

23:38.420 --> 23:40.454
Sophie and Hammer are collecting it now.

23:40.456 --> 23:42.055
But you still have no idea who she is.

23:42.057 --> 23:43.223
No.

23:43.225 --> 23:44.291
Not yet.

23:44.293 --> 23:46.326
Please tell me that was the bad news.

23:46.328 --> 23:50.230
The bad news is she and I
had a little... encounter.

23:50.232 --> 23:52.332
So, she knows that
we're looking for her.

23:52.334 --> 23:53.900
She knows that she's been compromised.

23:53.902 --> 23:55.969
Great. And now, so have you.

23:55.971 --> 23:57.637
And what were you doing

23:57.639 --> 23:59.539
when my would-be
killer made her escape?

23:59.541 --> 24:01.541
Mounting your hard drive.

24:01.543 --> 24:04.344
We're gonna re-assemble our
mystery woman's wall of crazy

24:04.346 --> 24:05.645
back at the office,

24:05.647 --> 24:07.547
see if we can figure out her next move.

24:07.549 --> 24:08.648
We'll call you.

24:08.650 --> 24:10.684
Where do you think you're going?

24:11.920 --> 24:14.154
Didn't you just kick me
out of here an hour ago?

24:15.157 --> 24:16.867
Don't be such a baby.

24:16.870 --> 24:18.703
Don't be such a bitch.

24:27.303 --> 24:28.461
You're taking your gun?

24:28.464 --> 24:31.104
You know how I hate to show up
to these things empty-handed.

24:31.863 --> 24:33.273
You're always so polite.

24:34.743 --> 24:37.277
Besides, Tasker will have one.

24:37.279 --> 24:38.512
He'll have more than one.

24:38.514 --> 24:41.548
And he'll have at least
two goons with him,

24:41.550 --> 24:43.550
and then one in the car.

24:44.798 --> 24:47.020
I'll be fine.

24:47.022 --> 24:48.822
I don't deserve you, Allie.

24:48.824 --> 24:50.357
No, you really don't.

24:50.359 --> 24:51.658
I'm serious.

24:53.829 --> 24:57.964
If the situation was reversed...

24:57.966 --> 25:01.401
I hope that I would do the same for you.

25:03.906 --> 25:04.938
Well...

25:06.777 --> 25:08.942
Good thing the situation's not reversed.

25:12.281 --> 25:13.780
Stay put.

25:13.782 --> 25:16.850
This will all be over soon.

25:16.852 --> 25:18.585
The diamonds are gone?

25:18.587 --> 25:19.619
We opened up the fish.

25:19.621 --> 25:20.854
They weren't there.

25:20.856 --> 25:22.222
Someone stole them in transit.

25:22.224 --> 25:23.590
Someone like...?

25:24.597 --> 25:26.293
Oh, come on, give us some credit.

25:26.295 --> 25:28.128
I mean, we might skim a few off the top,

25:28.130 --> 25:30.664
but we'd be idiots to
take them all, wouldn't we?

25:30.666 --> 25:32.111
Will you tell her? She
thinks we took them.

25:32.113 --> 25:33.400
Who else knew about the shipment?

25:33.402 --> 25:35.735
Just Jesse, Yumi, and us.

25:35.737 --> 25:38.471
So maybe one of them stole the diamonds.

25:38.473 --> 25:41.975
To cut the other one out. I
love the way your mind works.

25:41.977 --> 25:43.343
So cynical.

25:43.345 --> 25:44.344
They're in love.

25:44.346 --> 25:46.012
They're criminals in love.

25:46.014 --> 25:47.881
One of them's bound to turn
on the other eventually.

25:47.883 --> 25:49.823
She thinks so little
of us, of our people.

25:49.826 --> 25:53.186
She also happens to be right,
in my romantic experience.

25:53.188 --> 25:54.554
Yeah, I guess you're right.

25:54.556 --> 25:56.051
It's only a matter of time
before they kill each other.

25:56.053 --> 25:57.257
We don't have time.

25:57.259 --> 25:58.658
We need to speed things up.

25:58.660 --> 26:00.193
All right.

26:00.195 --> 26:01.595
Well, let's do that

26:01.597 --> 26:03.129
by turning them against each other.

26:03.131 --> 26:05.832
I like it. How are we gonna do that?

26:05.834 --> 26:09.302
I think maybe we let our
handler handle this one.

26:09.304 --> 26:10.937
Me?

26:10.939 --> 26:11.938
Did you not see the way

26:11.940 --> 26:13.473
Jesse was looking at
you the other night?

26:13.475 --> 26:14.441
Oh, shut up.

26:14.443 --> 26:15.809
- Was he?
- He was not.

26:15.811 --> 26:17.744
He was.

26:17.746 --> 26:19.613
Which will work to our advantage

26:19.615 --> 26:21.815
when you accidentally bump
into him on the street.

26:25.787 --> 26:27.787
Jesse? Hi!

26:27.789 --> 26:28.955
Hey!

26:28.957 --> 26:30.523
Simone, from the Dining Hall.

26:30.525 --> 26:32.559
Oh, right.

26:32.561 --> 26:34.127
Hey, how's your mom doing?

26:34.129 --> 26:35.195
Once you have him alone,

26:35.197 --> 26:36.396
you can tell him what happened

26:36.398 --> 26:38.064
when you drove his mom
home from the party.

26:38.066 --> 26:40.233
When you say she was sick, you mean...?

26:40.235 --> 26:42.135
I think she might have a problem.

26:42.137 --> 26:43.203
I only say that

26:43.205 --> 26:46.239
because my mom started drinking a lot

26:46.241 --> 26:47.874
when my dad died.

26:47.876 --> 26:49.576
I'm s... I shouldn't have said anything.

26:49.578 --> 26:50.644
No, you're right.

26:50.646 --> 26:51.878
I've just been so
wrapped up in my own...

26:51.880 --> 26:54.481
No, hey, don't do that to yourself.

26:54.483 --> 26:55.582
Talk to your mom.

26:55.584 --> 26:57.484
Tell her how you're feeling.

27:04.944 --> 27:07.294
Once we get the pictures...

27:07.296 --> 27:09.429
we send in Rhys.

27:09.431 --> 27:11.671
How did you get these?

27:11.674 --> 27:13.166
I followed him.

27:13.168 --> 27:14.801
Look, if I'm going into
business with somebody,

27:14.803 --> 27:16.121
I need to know I can trust him.

27:16.124 --> 27:18.038
And yet, here he is, in
the arms of another woman,

27:18.040 --> 27:20.473
betraying your trust...
For God knows how long.

27:21.810 --> 27:23.943
I'm so sorry.

27:26.515 --> 27:30.016
I'll get it all on film, and then...

27:30.018 --> 27:32.852
I'll complete the circle.

27:32.854 --> 27:34.087
You mean Rhys?

27:34.089 --> 27:36.089
And I'm sorry, but if
they're sleeping together,

27:36.091 --> 27:37.572
odds are they are working together.

27:37.575 --> 27:38.858
Let's look at the facts.

27:38.860 --> 27:40.360
He's already cheated and lied to you.

27:40.362 --> 27:41.594
If she's willing to do that,

27:41.596 --> 27:43.363
what makes you think she'll stop there?

27:43.365 --> 27:44.517
But the sad truth is, you
just can't trust him.

27:44.519 --> 27:45.360
You cannot trust her.

28:05.620 --> 28:08.421
No money, no Tommy.

28:08.423 --> 28:11.324
You really do have a
problem, Ms. Vaughan.

28:13.007 --> 28:14.707
Friends of yours?

28:14.710 --> 28:16.429
I'm gonna need you to come with us.

28:16.431 --> 28:19.199
I wish I could, but I have
to get back to the office,

28:19.201 --> 28:22.268
and you're about to get a
very important phone call.

28:22.270 --> 28:24.070
Get in the car.

28:24.072 --> 28:25.305
You don't believe me?

28:30.178 --> 28:31.960
Yes?

28:36.834 --> 28:38.251
No, that's a mistake.

28:38.253 --> 28:41.588
As of when?

28:43.458 --> 28:46.059
I'll call you back.

28:47.496 --> 28:50.830
I'm guessing the Securities
and Exchange Commission

28:50.832 --> 28:53.099
called your business manager to tell him

28:53.101 --> 28:57.237
the Optican Group and every other
phony corporation in your name

28:57.239 --> 28:59.939
has had its assets
frozen pending review.

28:59.941 --> 29:03.343
What the hell did you do?

29:03.345 --> 29:05.779
My friends at the SEC

29:05.781 --> 29:08.014
are now in control of all of your money.

29:08.016 --> 29:11.484
Oh, I'm sorry... All of
your bosses' money.

29:11.486 --> 29:15.422
Which I'm thinking might get you killed.

29:15.424 --> 29:19.292
So, if you want to stay alive,

29:19.294 --> 29:21.961
I suggest you do exactly as I say.

29:33.520 --> 29:34.933
What do you want?

29:34.936 --> 29:38.971
Confession... To the
murder of the Kincaids.

29:38.973 --> 29:41.474
You tell the police the truth,
that you pulled the trigger,

29:41.476 --> 29:43.474
and I'll have the SEC back off.

29:43.477 --> 29:45.144
I'm not telling the police anything.

29:45.146 --> 29:47.680
Then you'll have to
explain to your bosses

29:47.682 --> 29:49.682
how you lost all their money.

29:49.684 --> 29:51.684
How's that conversation gonna go?

29:51.686 --> 29:54.086
You might be better off in jail.

29:57.072 --> 29:58.524
They have people inside.

29:58.526 --> 30:01.026
So?

30:01.028 --> 30:03.295
Roll on them.

30:03.297 --> 30:05.231
I'm sure you have enough information

30:05.233 --> 30:07.233
to dismantle the entire organization.

30:11.105 --> 30:13.606
Release the money... now.

30:16.010 --> 30:17.276
Or you'll do what?

30:17.278 --> 30:20.312
You'll shoot me, the way
you shot the Kincaids?

30:20.314 --> 30:22.675
No, I shot them in the chest.

30:22.678 --> 30:24.311
You, I'll shoot in the head.

30:25.152 --> 30:26.485
You guys get that?

30:29.156 --> 30:30.022
LAPD!

30:30.024 --> 30:31.056
Drop the gun!

30:31.058 --> 30:32.658
On the ground... now!

30:32.660 --> 30:34.293
On the ground... now!

30:34.295 --> 30:36.295
Down... now!

30:42.236 --> 30:43.302
Yeah, we got that.

30:43.304 --> 30:45.271
Which means Tommy's in the clear.

30:45.273 --> 30:47.439
And if Tasker makes a deal,

30:47.441 --> 30:50.042
Tommy won't have the cartel
to worry about anymore.

30:50.044 --> 30:52.578
And you will be the
next Chief of Police.

30:52.580 --> 30:54.246
I don't know about that.

30:54.248 --> 30:56.849
One question.

30:56.851 --> 30:58.551
Were you bluffing,

30:58.553 --> 31:00.753
or do you really have
friends at the SEC?

31:12.875 --> 31:14.400
Wow.

31:14.402 --> 31:17.803
Nothing for six years,
and then twice in one day.

31:17.805 --> 31:19.872
I just wanted to give you this...

31:19.874 --> 31:20.806
Tommy's bail money.

31:20.808 --> 31:21.774
Oh, come on, Allie.

31:21.776 --> 31:24.677
I don't like to owe people favors.

31:24.679 --> 31:27.646
You never did.

31:27.647 --> 31:30.315
If my brother calls
you and needs help...

31:30.318 --> 31:31.383
He's my friend.

31:31.385 --> 31:33.052
You're enabling him, I'm enabling him.

31:33.054 --> 31:35.020
It has to stop.

31:37.396 --> 31:38.962
Yes, ma'am.

31:44.290 --> 31:45.689
Hey.

31:48.669 --> 31:51.637
I just need to know.

31:51.639 --> 31:55.040
Are you happy?

31:55.042 --> 31:56.875
I am.

31:56.877 --> 31:59.545
Good.

31:59.547 --> 32:01.747
That's all I ever wanted.

32:15.496 --> 32:17.229
From now on, I'm running the operation.

32:17.231 --> 32:18.597
You'll take orders from me.

32:18.599 --> 32:20.108
Uh, does Jesse know that?

32:20.111 --> 32:22.301
I'll deal with Jesse after
we collect the diamonds.

32:22.303 --> 32:24.203
That's the spirit. First things first.

32:29.243 --> 32:31.510
I'm gonna kill him.

32:31.512 --> 32:33.312
Well, well. Look who's here.

32:33.314 --> 32:34.446
Damn it.

32:34.448 --> 32:35.481
I should have known.

32:35.483 --> 32:36.649
I should have known.

32:36.651 --> 32:37.616
Where are the diamonds?

32:37.618 --> 32:38.751
I'm assuming they're in your pants,

32:38.753 --> 32:40.019
- just like Yumi.
- What?!

32:40.021 --> 32:41.086
Oh, come off it.

32:41.088 --> 32:42.655
We both know you stole the diamonds.

32:42.657 --> 32:43.989
Now, you see what he's doing?

32:43.991 --> 32:45.090
First he sleeps with your girlfriend...

32:45.092 --> 32:46.425
- He did not.
- Repeatedly.

32:46.427 --> 32:47.993
And then he steals the diamonds,

32:47.995 --> 32:50.162
blames us so he can keep her cut.

32:50.164 --> 32:52.197
You think I'm rogering
this girl senseless

32:52.199 --> 32:53.599
for the diamonds?

32:53.601 --> 32:54.566
He is not.

32:54.568 --> 32:56.669
Isn't that why you rogered me?

32:56.671 --> 32:58.370
- What?
- What?

32:58.372 --> 33:00.506
Don't pretend you didn't enjoy it.

33:00.508 --> 33:02.274
- I did what I had to do.
- Yeah.

33:02.276 --> 33:04.338
I work for Jesse now.
This is his operation.

33:04.341 --> 33:05.507
His operation?

33:05.510 --> 33:07.780
This whole smuggling thing was my idea.

33:07.782 --> 33:09.314
This was my idea,

33:09.316 --> 33:11.717
and you repay me by
sleeping with that old man?

33:11.719 --> 33:12.851
"Old man"?

33:12.853 --> 33:14.119
Give me that. I'm gonna kill him.

33:14.121 --> 33:15.020
FBI!

33:15.022 --> 33:16.055
Drop the gun.

33:16.057 --> 33:17.265
Simone?

33:17.268 --> 33:18.424
I said, drop it.

33:21.095 --> 33:22.795
You're under arrest for
smuggling, grand larceny,

33:22.797 --> 33:24.363
and attempted murder.

33:24.365 --> 33:25.397
You, too, sweetheart.

33:25.399 --> 33:26.732
Wait, you're a cop?

33:26.734 --> 33:28.986
FBI... she said it when she walked in.

33:28.989 --> 33:30.536
This is the problem
with kids these days.

33:30.538 --> 33:33.238
They don't listen.

33:33.240 --> 33:34.873
Cutting it a little
close, don't you think?

33:34.875 --> 33:36.208
Oh, we would have come in sooner,

33:36.210 --> 33:37.376
but you were two were on a roll.

33:37.378 --> 33:38.677
The boys wanted to listen in.

33:38.679 --> 33:40.382
- Brightens their day.
- Hmm.

33:40.385 --> 33:41.680
I'm glad you're not dead.

33:41.682 --> 33:44.016
Aww, see? She does care.

33:49.423 --> 33:52.257
Look at you, detective-ing.

33:52.259 --> 33:54.760
- Not very well at the moment.
- Oh, what?

33:54.762 --> 33:57.863
Not enough you brought down
an entire drug cartel today?

33:57.865 --> 33:59.198
Tasker's gonna make a deal?

33:59.200 --> 34:01.033
Thanks to you and Alice.

34:01.035 --> 34:02.935
You know, I get it now.

34:02.937 --> 34:06.171
Your partner is almost as
big a badass as you are.

34:07.001 --> 34:08.507
I would have left me for her, too.

34:08.509 --> 34:10.208
I did not leave you. I know.

34:10.210 --> 34:11.643
But as far as I'm concerned,

34:11.645 --> 34:14.012
the band is officially back together.

34:15.049 --> 34:17.014
Hey, Nick.

34:17.016 --> 34:19.518
Uh, the cartel money is evidence now,

34:19.520 --> 34:21.320
so I'll just go get it.

34:28.440 --> 34:30.915
_

34:54.522 --> 34:56.455
You forgot to say goodbye.

35:08.271 --> 35:11.506
You are really very,
very good at your job.

35:11.508 --> 35:13.174
How did you find me?

35:13.176 --> 35:14.475
I put a tracker in the bag.

35:14.477 --> 35:16.210
'Cause you knew that I would steal it.

35:16.212 --> 35:18.846
I hoped you wouldn't, but...

35:18.848 --> 35:21.516
So... what now?

35:21.518 --> 35:24.952
Are you gonna take me
down with your spinjitsu?

35:24.954 --> 35:27.121
Are you gonna break me
down psychologically?

35:27.123 --> 35:29.424
Are you gonna call Mom?

35:31.027 --> 35:33.494
No, I'm not gonna do anything.

35:33.496 --> 35:36.431
My offer stands... Come work with me.

35:36.433 --> 35:40.335
You can live with me for
as long as you need to.

35:40.338 --> 35:41.736
You don't have to do this.

35:41.738 --> 35:42.637
Allie!

35:46.309 --> 35:49.577
But if you do take that money,

35:49.579 --> 35:50.878
we're done, you and me.

35:50.880 --> 35:53.848
You say that now.

35:53.850 --> 35:57.151
There's only so many times
I can let you break my heart.

36:01.324 --> 36:03.658
Sorry.

36:05.995 --> 36:08.096
But I-I know who I am.

36:09.999 --> 36:11.666
I'm not good like you.

36:11.668 --> 36:13.501
I was never good!

36:13.503 --> 36:16.404
Tommy, you know me.

36:16.406 --> 36:20.011
I'm proof you can change.

36:30.253 --> 36:31.119
Yeah?

36:41.364 --> 36:42.663
I'm sorry.

36:59.215 --> 37:00.815
Don't call me!

37:00.817 --> 37:02.950
Don't write!

37:02.952 --> 37:05.253
Don't ever come back!

37:16.800 --> 37:20.201
I've got to say, the
Bureau is very impressed.

37:20.203 --> 37:22.136
Jesse and Yumi are being extradited.

37:22.138 --> 37:24.839
Poor Mrs. Takashi is going to rehab.

37:24.841 --> 37:27.608
And somehow, we managed to bring down

37:27.610 --> 37:29.544
an international smuggling ring

37:29.546 --> 37:31.674
without creating an
international incident.

37:31.677 --> 37:33.815
Well, that's pretty good, even for us.

37:33.817 --> 37:35.049
Which calls for a toast.

37:35.051 --> 37:36.784
The only thing is...

37:36.786 --> 37:38.119
I'm drinking anyway.

37:38.121 --> 37:40.555
We still don't know
who took the diamonds...

37:40.557 --> 37:42.456
do we?

37:42.458 --> 37:44.759
W-We told you.

37:44.761 --> 37:45.927
I know.

37:45.929 --> 37:47.528
It wasn't us.

37:47.530 --> 37:48.830
And I'm choosing to believe you,

37:48.832 --> 37:51.833
but I'm gonna find out
who did it eventually

37:51.835 --> 37:55.403
and go after them with
everything I've got.

37:55.405 --> 37:57.138
- Well, that was a terrible toast.
- Yeah, really.

37:57.140 --> 37:59.307
Here's to better toasts in the future.

38:06.883 --> 38:10.318
This is exactly the way it was
on our mystery woman's wall.

38:10.320 --> 38:11.986
Clearly, a woman after my own heart.

38:11.988 --> 38:13.855
You know how I love a wall of crazy.

38:13.857 --> 38:15.656
It's obsessive, to say the least.

38:15.658 --> 38:16.591
And so thorough.

38:16.593 --> 38:18.459
I'm kind of impressed.

38:18.461 --> 38:20.027
She collected intel

38:20.029 --> 38:22.029
on nearly everyone
affiliated with the Firm,

38:22.031 --> 38:24.532
including those three
lieutenants who wound up dead.

38:24.534 --> 38:25.967
What are these buildings?

38:25.969 --> 38:27.268
They're all owned by the Firm.

38:27.270 --> 38:28.536
Including the church?

38:28.538 --> 38:30.204
No, the building next to it.

38:30.206 --> 38:32.006
They're not even here, are they?

38:32.008 --> 38:33.124
You stashed them in the Rectory.

38:33.126 --> 38:34.108
Get out!

38:34.110 --> 38:37.345
I will when you give
me my diamonds back.

38:37.347 --> 38:40.014
Sophie, can you check to
see if that has a rectory?

38:40.016 --> 38:40.982
Why?

38:42.785 --> 38:45.219
Yeah, the rectory was added in 1940.

38:45.221 --> 38:47.054
That church is a Kensington safehouse.

38:47.056 --> 38:47.955
How do you know?

38:47.957 --> 38:50.291
I... heard Margot talking.

38:50.293 --> 38:53.761
The Rectory, if you must know,

38:53.763 --> 38:55.830
houses the cash and munitions

38:55.832 --> 38:57.698
we've accrued in Los Angeles thus far.

38:57.700 --> 38:58.866
Is it secured?

38:58.868 --> 39:00.534
Of course... Armed
guards around the clock.

39:00.536 --> 39:02.303
- And there's a vault?
- In the catacombs.

39:02.305 --> 39:04.071
My men checked in 20 minutes ago.

39:04.073 --> 39:05.306
It hasn't been tampered with.

39:05.308 --> 39:06.207
So we still have time.

39:06.209 --> 39:07.041
For what?

39:07.043 --> 39:08.042
To set a trap.

39:09.212 --> 39:10.745
If our mystery woman's gonna act,

39:10.747 --> 39:11.946
she's gonna do it soon.

39:11.948 --> 39:14.749
She's done her homework
on you and the Firm,

39:14.751 --> 39:17.251
so she's gonna know how
to get inside the church...

39:17.253 --> 39:19.487
how to make her way down,

39:19.489 --> 39:21.923
and go straight to the vault.

39:24.060 --> 39:25.993
She'll be prepared for security...

39:29.108 --> 39:31.079
...and ready to crack
into any alarm system...

39:31.082 --> 39:32.333
hat stands in her way.

39:42.245 --> 39:43.577
But when she gets in there,

39:43.579 --> 39:45.413
she's gonna find the one
thing she's not ready for...

39:46.249 --> 39:47.848
...us.

39:49.419 --> 39:50.952
Not this time, lady.

39:50.954 --> 39:52.720
Who are you?

39:52.722 --> 39:55.356
You don't recognize me?

39:55.358 --> 39:58.225
No, I've never seen
you before in my life.

39:58.227 --> 39:59.894
Well...

40:01.564 --> 40:02.929
It has been a while.

40:05.368 --> 40:06.667
Mummy.
