00:09.376 --> 00:10.377
[Rachel] Dick is dying.

00:13.413 --> 00:14.381
I can feel it.

00:20.220 --> 00:21.187
Can you find him?

00:26.092 --> 00:27.160
[Rachel] Follow me.

00:39.105 --> 00:40.073
[Gar] Dick!

00:41.374 --> 00:42.375
[Rachel] No!

00:43.676 --> 00:44.944
[Rachel breathing heavily]

00:45.045 --> 00:46.279
[Gar] Rach, is there anything
you can do?

01:01.461 --> 01:02.529
[Rachel sobs] Dick!

01:06.399 --> 01:07.367
[Rachel] No.

01:14.774 --> 01:16.042
It's too late.

01:16.109 --> 01:17.410
[somber music playing]

01:47.173 --> 01:48.141
Gar?

01:51.945 --> 01:53.179
[screeching]

02:40.493 --> 02:41.728
Gar, now!

02:41.828 --> 02:43.129
[screeching continues]

03:02.815 --> 03:04.317
[ominous music playing]

03:11.191 --> 03:12.058
[Gar] Rachel?

03:14.827 --> 03:15.728
Is he gonna make it?

03:18.831 --> 03:19.766
I don't know.

03:27.407 --> 03:29.509
[theme music playing]

03:45.725 --> 03:47.427
[metallic scraping]

03:55.201 --> 03:59.872
-[Jason] Nightwing is dead.
-[Crane] Batman saved my toy.

04:00.807 --> 04:02.108
[Crane chuckles]

04:05.211 --> 04:07.647
A trinket of our
courtship together.

04:09.749 --> 04:13.052
Who would have thought
he was so sentimental?

04:14.087 --> 04:15.088
[Jason] Did you hear me?

04:15.989 --> 04:17.457
I said Nightwing is dead!

04:19.425 --> 04:22.562
So? He wasn't my monster.

04:23.429 --> 04:24.831
[metal clangs]

04:25.598 --> 04:27.600
He's your monster.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.736
What do you want,
a cookie? [chuckles]

04:30.837 --> 04:32.605
But you said that's what
you wanted.

04:34.607 --> 04:37.510
When it was done,
we would save Gotham our way.

04:37.610 --> 04:41.581
Gotham will be saved,
but first it must be destroyed.

04:45.952 --> 04:51.090
As clever hopes expire,
waves of fear and anger

04:51.157 --> 04:55.428
circulate over
the bright and darkened
lands of the Earth.

04:55.495 --> 04:57.430
What the fuck kind
of gibberish is that?

04:57.497 --> 05:02.168
No, not gibberish, no.
It's the past come to life
in the present.

05:05.371 --> 05:08.041
An ode to the Bat
and his wee Bird

05:09.108 --> 05:10.810
from when they stopped me.

05:10.877 --> 05:12.812
But they can't stop me now.

05:12.879 --> 05:15.448
No, they can't stop me now

05:16.215 --> 05:17.283
because...

05:19.819 --> 05:23.389
because we will walk
among them.
The dead.

05:25.458 --> 05:27.327
And the fallen city
will be like...

05:29.128 --> 05:30.530
It'll be like a beacon.

05:32.965 --> 05:36.402
Very soon, Jason.
Very, very soon
they will die.

05:36.502 --> 05:37.704
Yes, they will die.

05:39.739 --> 05:41.908
-Who will die?
-All of them!

05:42.742 --> 05:46.679
All of them. Everybody.

05:53.219 --> 05:58.324
You still stink of fear.
After all that I've given you.

05:58.391 --> 06:00.393
You said I was gonna
be a savior.

06:01.928 --> 06:03.930
I won't help you
destroy the city.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.499
[sighs] Well...

06:09.869 --> 06:10.937
perhaps you won't.

06:12.438 --> 06:13.539
[grunts]

06:19.946 --> 06:22.115
[clanging]

06:27.587 --> 06:30.390
Keep running, boy...
keep running.

06:36.062 --> 06:42.635
"As the clever hopes expire,
waves of fear and anger...

06:44.070 --> 06:50.376
waves of fear and anger...
waves of fear and anger."

06:53.246 --> 06:55.882
There's heavy smoke coming from
an explosion south of the dock.

06:55.948 --> 06:59.986
Last radio alert said
that someone saw Crane's
cops at Greene and Sixth.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.388
They're wiping out
the Resistance cells
one by one.

07:02.455 --> 07:04.657
Heading east.
Right toward us.
We don't have much time.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.726
Let's get everyone together.
Go over the plan again

07:06.793 --> 07:08.961
and make sure everyone's
armed and ready.

07:09.061 --> 07:10.396
[Stephen] Grab them while
they're hot.

07:12.732 --> 07:14.233
[Janet] Where'd did you
get those?

07:14.300 --> 07:16.836
Tim's got a secret closet,
I got a secret stash.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.073
[Tim] Hey, cuz.
Know how to use an Uzi?

07:22.074 --> 07:23.075
[exhales softly]

07:24.777 --> 07:25.945
Nightwing is dead.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.014
What?

07:28.114 --> 07:29.515
That... that's impossible.

07:29.615 --> 07:32.351
A guy had photos of his dead
body in the street.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.821
I've got them, it's him.

07:34.921 --> 07:35.822
Show me.

07:42.028 --> 07:43.696
You can't believe
everything you see.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.331
Those don't look real to you?

07:45.431 --> 07:47.366
Scarecrow's weaving his web.
We don't know what's real.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.801
[Janet] It's real enough
for me.

07:48.868 --> 07:50.970
If superheroes are dying,
we don't stand a chance.

07:51.037 --> 07:52.371
We need to get out of Gotham.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.607
Find a way past
the GCPD Border Patrol.

07:54.674 --> 07:57.210
I got friends who tried.
They're dead.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.646
I heard there might be
an underground route
north of the docks.

08:00.713 --> 08:02.648
-If we can make it there--
-Go if you want.

08:03.649 --> 08:04.817
I'm fighting to save Gotham.

08:04.884 --> 08:07.553
Son... there's no
Gotham left to save.

08:07.653 --> 08:08.788
Not if we just give up.

08:08.855 --> 08:11.190
Enough trying
to be a superhero.

08:11.290 --> 08:12.225
Last time you almost died.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.493
No one's going to die.

08:14.861 --> 08:16.062
Stay here. I'll be back.

08:28.374 --> 08:29.642
[cell door buzzes]

08:41.220 --> 08:42.855
The fuck do you
think you're doing?

08:45.024 --> 08:46.192
What you should have done.

Now for our daily trivia.

of Nightwing,

Eternity.

11:18.844 --> 11:23.049
Your story begins the night
your parents died.

11:23.149 --> 11:26.252
When Mommy and Daddy died,
a door in you closed.

11:27.820 --> 11:32.558
You closed it in an attempt
to avoid further pain.

11:32.658 --> 11:34.260
Didn't quite work though,
did it?

11:34.360 --> 11:36.262
What are you talking about?

11:36.362 --> 11:40.066
When a parent dies, it's like
the ground beneath you
suddenly gives way.

11:41.867 --> 11:44.070
You trust nothing good again,
not fully.

11:45.905 --> 11:48.040
You live in fear.

11:48.107 --> 11:51.844
But Bruce Wayne,
he showed you how
to live with that fear.

11:51.911 --> 11:55.381
Punish it, strike first.

11:55.448 --> 11:59.185
And then that's all you had.
Fear and rage.

11:59.251 --> 12:02.288
You felt fear, and dealt rage.

[indistinct shouting]

You lost.

-...of Bruce Wayne.

12:25.945 --> 12:27.279
But he was not your father.

12:28.881 --> 12:32.318
You are the son
of John Grayson.

12:32.418 --> 12:35.087
And he would be
so disappointed with the man
that you've become.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.657
You're failing him.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.092
Just like you failed everyone.

[Nightwing] Donna!

[Crane]<i> You always</i>

13:00.446 --> 13:02.681
-No.
-[Crane] So you killed him.

13:02.782 --> 13:03.983
No, it was the Joker.

13:06.152 --> 13:08.854
The Joker was just a weapon
in your hands.

13:10.823 --> 13:12.124
[Joker cackling]

13:25.638 --> 13:27.640
[Crane] You always
wanted Jason gone.

13:28.707 --> 13:30.109
So you abandoned him.

13:33.045 --> 13:35.014
You hated him.

13:35.114 --> 13:37.817
You wanted to be
the Detective's only son.

13:37.883 --> 13:39.985
And then Jason came
and he took your place.

13:41.020 --> 13:42.021
He took your home...

13:45.124 --> 13:46.025
he took your father.

Please.

Don't. Please don't do this.

Let it go.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.111
Dick said
we were family.

15:46.178 --> 15:48.514
But family is supposed
to be there for you.

15:48.614 --> 15:49.748
Not betray you.

15:49.815 --> 15:51.450
I'm done pretending
that's possible.

15:51.517 --> 15:53.852
From now on,
I do what I want.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.755
I don't know
what I want.

15:56.822 --> 15:59.992
There's a part of me
that wants to destroy Dick
for what he did to me.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.429
There's the part that says
the family is everything,

16:03.495 --> 16:06.098
and I should always do good,
not harm.

16:08.534 --> 16:11.003
Maybe we can
do good together,

16:11.971 --> 16:12.771
as a team.

16:12.838 --> 16:14.373
-A team?
-Why not?

16:14.473 --> 16:16.175
I've got some
loose ends to tie up.

16:17.309 --> 16:18.344
We could do it together.

16:19.044 --> 16:20.012
Then keep going.

16:20.112 --> 16:21.647
-Just you and me?

-We both know what it's like,

16:29.822 --> 16:32.057
to be treated
as if we don't belong.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.194
We can make sure
others like us

16:35.294 --> 16:37.296
get the respect
and protection they deserve.

16:37.363 --> 16:38.530

Take your positions.

16:59.351 --> 17:04.156
Tim. Keep the safety on
until showtime.

17:04.223 --> 17:05.491
You got this, son.

17:07.092 --> 17:08.160
Be careful.

17:09.728 --> 17:11.063
If anyone gets past us,

17:11.163 --> 17:13.065
-you know what to do.
-I love you.

17:16.168 --> 17:17.669
[dramatic music intensifies]

17:30.182 --> 17:31.350
[engine revving]

17:34.586 --> 17:35.921
Don't ding up your ride.

17:36.755 --> 17:37.890
[sighs in relief]

17:46.932 --> 17:48.967
[ethereal music plays]

17:49.068 --> 17:50.569
[grunts softly]

17:53.906 --> 17:55.441
Can you sense him
in there?

17:57.109 --> 18:00.145
He has to fight, Gar.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.948
We can't help him, anymore.
He has to fight.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.451
[sighs] He will.

18:10.122 --> 18:11.723
[Rachel] What's wrong?

18:11.790 --> 18:13.092
[Gar groans] I'm okay.

18:14.393 --> 18:16.261
The bat... I'm still
working through it.

18:17.596 --> 18:18.730
How did you do that?

18:20.432 --> 18:21.934
I don't know.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.436
These new changes,
they always happen
when I'm afraid.

18:25.971 --> 18:27.339
It's like,
my ability to change

18:27.439 --> 18:28.507
is locked behind a door.

18:29.675 --> 18:30.909
And fear...

18:33.278 --> 18:36.281
[sighs] Fear cracks it open
for a brief moment.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.451
And then it just
slams shut again.

18:41.487 --> 18:44.590
When it happens,
when I start to change,

18:44.656 --> 18:45.991
it feels like I'm dying.

18:47.693 --> 18:49.595
I know I can do more,
I can...

18:50.329 --> 18:51.430
be more.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.933
I just don't want it
to always be this way.

18:58.770 --> 19:02.207
My whole life,
I thought it was hate

19:02.307 --> 19:03.375
that gave me power.

19:04.376 --> 19:05.811
Like my father.

19:05.878 --> 19:07.312
You're nothing like him.

19:07.379 --> 19:09.047
I know that.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.783
But I know that because
when it came time
for me to face him...

19:12.651 --> 19:13.986
it wasn't hate...

19:14.820 --> 19:16.522
that gave me power.

19:16.622 --> 19:19.525
It was love, for you...

19:20.659 --> 19:21.693
for Dick...

19:22.628 --> 19:24.229
for Kory.

19:24.329 --> 19:27.332
I wouldn't let him hurt you

19:28.167 --> 19:31.136
because I loved you

19:31.203 --> 19:35.073
and that gave me
all the strength
I could possibly need.

19:36.875 --> 19:39.878
It unlocked everything
for me.

19:44.683 --> 19:45.717
Close your eyes.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.221
Trust me.

20:02.334 --> 20:04.536
When you saw Dick's, body,
you felt...

20:05.871 --> 20:07.105
so much pain.

20:08.507 --> 20:10.776
But then you saw the bats.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.911
You knew you had
to join them.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.248
They found you because...

20:16.348 --> 20:19.084
they knew you loved
Dick Grayson.

20:22.020 --> 20:24.256
You have everything
you need.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.564
[water sloshing]

20:32.631 --> 20:34.066
Something is happening.

20:42.207 --> 20:43.375
[crowbar clanging]

20:44.109 --> 20:45.877
[grunting]

20:47.913 --> 20:49.815
[Dick panting]

20:49.915 --> 20:51.917
[Crane] You're mine now.

20:51.984 --> 20:54.119
And you are never
going to escape.

20:57.122 --> 20:58.290
[straining]

21:03.929 --> 21:05.163
I don't want this.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.432
[dramatic music intensifying]

21:10.902 --> 21:12.504
[triumphant music playing]

21:21.680 --> 21:23.081
[boy laughing]

21:32.124 --> 21:33.859
[serene music playing]

21:40.265 --> 21:41.166
Dad!

22:00.819 --> 22:01.953
Dad, I'm sorry.

22:03.388 --> 22:04.456
I lost my way.

22:07.526 --> 22:09.227
I was trying to be
someone I'm not.

22:11.730 --> 22:13.165
And I failed you.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.302
It's okay, son.

22:20.639 --> 22:21.673
I love you.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.264
[girl] Daddy, come here.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.444
Hi, Daddy.

23:37.282 --> 23:38.817
[Crane reciting]
<i>"What huge imago made</i>

23:40.952 --> 23:42.487
<i>A psychopathic god:</i>

23:53.765 --> 23:55.500
<i>I and the public know</i>

23:55.600 --> 23:58.136
<i>What all schoolchildren learn</i>

23:58.236 --> 24:00.338
Those to whom evil is done

24:00.439 --> 24:02.340
Do evil in return."

24:06.812 --> 24:11.283
[suspenseful music playing]

24:13.952 --> 24:15.020
Jason.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.288
[gasping]

24:18.423 --> 24:20.158
Your father wasn't
the only one you failed.

24:20.258 --> 24:21.693
You failed Jason
as well.

24:21.793 --> 24:22.627
There's still time.

24:22.694 --> 24:23.862
Time for what?

24:23.962 --> 24:25.530
-Time to change him.
-To change? No.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.265
No, no, no.
He works for me now.

24:27.332 --> 24:29.201
All it took was a simple
fear treaty.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.870
And poof!
His soul was mine.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.104
I can stop you.

24:33.171 --> 24:34.506
No, you can never
stop me now.

24:34.606 --> 24:36.808
You had your chance
and you failed.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.981
[triumphant music playing]

24:47.819 --> 24:48.820
[gasps]

24:52.324 --> 24:53.792
[coughing]

24:55.160 --> 24:56.194
Dick.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.340
-[Krypto barks]
-[gasps]

25:08.406 --> 25:12.043
Hey, why are you
in here, huh?

25:12.143 --> 25:14.045
Why? You got a leash law?

25:14.846 --> 25:16.381
Oh, my God.

25:16.481 --> 25:18.750
I'm dreaming.
You're Superboy.

25:18.850 --> 25:19.918
And you're an asshole.

25:20.018 --> 25:22.554
What? Wait.
What are you doing?

25:22.654 --> 25:24.923
That's up to my girlfriend.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.658
Is it okay if I call you
my girlfriend?

25:27.859 --> 25:28.894
You better.

25:33.698 --> 25:36.768
Uh, hi, Blackfire.

25:36.868 --> 25:38.870
Well, it is... it is
so great to see you.

25:38.937 --> 25:42.207
And how cool that you two
are a couple, right?

25:42.274 --> 25:44.175
Man, I love when
people find love.

25:44.242 --> 25:47.612
I see you're still hard
at work doing
the government's ill deeds.

25:47.712 --> 25:49.548
I prefer to call it research.

25:51.416 --> 25:52.450
[gasps]

25:54.553 --> 25:56.187
You have firepower now.

25:56.254 --> 25:58.456
-That is very--
-Hot.

25:58.557 --> 26:01.760
Look, I understand
you have some
unresolved feelings,

26:01.860 --> 26:05.897
but... if I could ask,
very politely,

26:05.964 --> 26:07.532
that, if, maybe
you could refrain

26:07.599 --> 26:09.801
from destroying
government property.

26:09.901 --> 26:14.072
Hm. Good point.
It's not the stuff,
that's the problem.

26:14.139 --> 26:15.140
It's the people.

26:16.374 --> 26:17.609
Please don't hurt me.

26:17.709 --> 26:18.810
You didn't care
when you were hurting me.

26:18.910 --> 26:20.145
Wait! Wait!

26:20.245 --> 26:21.479
I have something you want.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.281
-He's lying.
-No, no, no, no, I'm not.

26:23.381 --> 26:24.950
If you let me live,
I'll prove it.

26:27.552 --> 26:28.553
Prove it.

26:33.425 --> 26:34.626
Is that your ship?

26:35.627 --> 26:36.461
Yes.

26:38.163 --> 26:40.231
You told me
you destroyed it.

26:40.298 --> 26:42.400
Yeah, that was a tiny
white lie.

26:42.467 --> 26:44.603
We retrieved it
so we could study.

26:44.669 --> 26:46.838
But, uh, in light
of recent events

26:46.938 --> 26:49.341
and in exchange for
my physical well-being,

26:49.441 --> 26:52.644
I would love
to return it to you.

26:52.744 --> 26:55.413
And I'll even nix
the storage fee.

26:56.181 --> 26:57.315
That was a joke.

26:57.415 --> 26:58.350
[Blackfire]
I have no use for it.

26:59.818 --> 27:02.454
What do you mean?
It's your only way home.

27:03.788 --> 27:05.357
Why would I want
to return home

27:05.457 --> 27:07.859
to a planet where
everyone hates me?

27:07.959 --> 27:11.096
The people of Tamaran
treated me just like you did.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.498
And they were wrong.

27:16.968 --> 27:18.536
We were all wrong.

27:18.637 --> 27:19.871
How did you find me?

27:19.971 --> 27:22.474
You said you had
unfinished business.

27:22.540 --> 27:24.676
Figured this was the first
place you'd go.

27:24.776 --> 27:26.111
If you're here to kill me...

27:27.212 --> 27:28.947
I'm happy to meet
the challenge.

27:30.615 --> 27:31.983
I'm not here to kill anyone.

27:35.186 --> 27:36.287
But we need to talk.

27:39.157 --> 27:40.025
[gasps]

27:45.497 --> 27:46.297
Rachel.

27:46.364 --> 27:47.666
[breathing heavily]

27:47.732 --> 27:48.566
Gar.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.035
It's okay now, you're safe.

27:50.669 --> 27:51.903
Let us help you.

27:52.003 --> 27:53.638
Are you all right?

27:53.705 --> 27:55.306
What... what happened
down there?

27:59.144 --> 28:00.912
Crane can be stopped.

28:01.012 --> 28:02.147
There's still time.

28:02.213 --> 28:04.649
Wait, Dick,
you need to rest, man.

28:04.716 --> 28:07.318
Anton and First Street,
there's an abandoned
control room.

28:07.385 --> 28:09.054
Find Conner.
Make sure he is okay.

28:09.854 --> 28:11.322
Unite the Titans.

28:11.389 --> 28:12.691
Unite the Titans where?

28:13.725 --> 28:14.826
Take them to Donna.

28:16.494 --> 28:17.862
Did he just say Donna?

28:20.498 --> 28:22.100
Apparently they haven't
secured the Kane Bridge,

28:22.200 --> 28:23.501
or the Tenth Street tunnel,

28:23.568 --> 28:24.569
so those are our best routes
out of the city.

28:27.105 --> 28:29.407
You wanna get my family
out of Gotham? Fine.

28:29.507 --> 28:31.009
But I'm staying
with you to fight.

28:31.076 --> 28:33.611
-This isn't a debate.
-And you're not my mother.

28:33.712 --> 28:36.614
No, but she's right there.
Do you see that look
on her face?

28:36.715 --> 28:38.750
She can't lose
her only son.

28:38.850 --> 28:40.218
So if you give
one shit about her,

28:40.285 --> 28:41.953
you'll stop being yammering
and do as I say.

28:42.053 --> 28:43.388
I didn't make it
across that bridge

28:43.455 --> 28:45.123
to come back
and be a coward.

28:45.223 --> 28:47.759
You made it across that bridge
because Hank made a sacrifice.

28:47.859 --> 28:51.129
He put your life before
his because that's what
a true hero does.

28:52.230 --> 28:53.698
You wanna be a hero?

28:53.765 --> 28:56.067
Save your mom's life,
and fucking live.

28:56.134 --> 28:57.268
Get in the damn truck.

29:02.941 --> 29:04.642
Classic Gotham bullshit.

29:06.644 --> 29:07.712
All my life...

29:09.581 --> 29:11.116
this feeling like
I was more...

29:12.250 --> 29:13.718
that I was meant
to be a queen.

29:14.953 --> 29:15.787
You are.

29:17.489 --> 29:18.790
It's your destiny.

29:19.958 --> 29:21.126
[Blackfire] And you
had no idea...

29:23.595 --> 29:25.630
-this entire time?
-No.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.133
The visions led me to it.

29:30.635 --> 29:32.670
I wish it weren't true.

29:32.771 --> 29:33.805
[Blackfire]
It's not your fault.

29:35.140 --> 29:36.407
Our parents did this.

29:38.777 --> 29:39.811
They lied...

29:41.346 --> 29:42.413
to both of us.

29:47.619 --> 29:51.656
But a queen's power lies
not in shedding tears
over battles lost.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.126
I finally know my truth.

29:56.828 --> 29:59.097
Now I want my throne.

29:59.164 --> 30:01.766
How long will it take
to prepare my ship to Tamaran?

30:01.833 --> 30:02.834
You wanna go back?

30:03.968 --> 30:05.637
Uh, actually,

30:05.703 --> 30:10.208
about that one small
thing about your ship,
Your Majesty...

30:10.308 --> 30:12.210
Is that what they call
queens on Tamaran?

30:12.310 --> 30:14.879
-Is there a different term or--
-On with it.
What about my ship?

30:14.979 --> 30:18.283
Uh, in studying its unique
and powerful fuel orb,

30:18.349 --> 30:23.354
my research team, uh,
accidentally... destroyed it.

30:23.454 --> 30:25.290
Well, we'll mine some more.

30:25.356 --> 30:26.958
[Starfire] It's not
that simple.

30:27.025 --> 30:28.493
The ore is plentiful
on Tamaran

30:28.560 --> 30:30.328
but it doesn't exist here
on Earth.

30:30.395 --> 30:33.164
Yeah. We mined what's
most comparable, but to...

30:33.231 --> 30:37.135
develop that into
the purified compound
that your ship needs...

30:37.202 --> 30:39.904
Well, that takes the kind of
intense heat and pressure

30:40.004 --> 30:41.739
that's only achievable
at the Earth's core

30:41.840 --> 30:44.709
and applied over
several centuries.

30:44.809 --> 30:46.344
We don't need any of that.

30:46.411 --> 30:47.478
We have Superboy.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.714
Can we, uh...

30:50.582 --> 30:51.649
Can we talk?

30:54.886 --> 30:56.588
Why are you doing this?

30:56.688 --> 30:59.390
You know Kryptonians
can't survive on Tamaran.

30:59.490 --> 31:01.025
And why do you even
wanna go back?

31:01.092 --> 31:02.727
You said it yourself,
they never appreciated you.

31:02.827 --> 31:04.062
But now it's different.

31:05.063 --> 31:06.397
Now, I'm their queen.

31:06.497 --> 31:08.933
[scoffs] So you need to be
a queen to matter?

31:10.935 --> 31:12.837
You mattered to me
from the moment I saw you.

31:17.041 --> 31:18.076
Komand'r.

31:21.546 --> 31:22.747
Stay here with me.

31:24.215 --> 31:25.750
To hell with everyone else.

31:31.456 --> 31:32.690
I wish I could.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.427

the rest of them.

and then change the rules.

31:43.801 --> 31:45.937
I meant what I said about
wanting us to be together.

31:48.539 --> 31:50.041
But ever since I was a girl...

31:51.776 --> 31:54.212
there's been
a voice inside me,

31:54.279 --> 31:56.547
that says that
I am meant to be more

31:56.614 --> 31:58.416
than what others
make me out to be.

32:01.052 --> 32:02.387
Now I finally know...

32:04.956 --> 32:07.058
that voice was telling me
who I really am.

32:10.461 --> 32:12.230

to Tamaran...

32:16.167 --> 32:17.235

32:18.937 --> 32:20.638
And if I don't go back now...

32:27.812 --> 32:29.080
I never will.

-I know it's a lot to ask.

to do this for my family.

34:31.736 --> 34:33.071
They made their choices.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.473
My dad was a cop.

34:35.573 --> 34:36.874
Every day he walked out
the door,

34:36.941 --> 34:39.143
we had no guarantee
he'd come back.

34:39.243 --> 34:42.213
But that's the life he chose.
And we respected it.

34:42.280 --> 34:43.748
This is different.

34:43.815 --> 34:46.117
I'm not gonna let you sign up

34:50.822 --> 34:52.423
You think you can
do better than us?

34:52.490 --> 34:54.492
Survive things
that we couldn't?

34:54.592 --> 34:59.230
All I know is... even before
you and Hawk helped me
across that bridge...

34:59.297 --> 35:01.232
I knew why I had to come back.

35:01.299 --> 35:03.634
And it wasn't to save
my family.

35:03.734 --> 35:07.338
It was to help save Gotham,
to be the next Robin.

35:08.840 --> 35:11.142
And if I die doing it,
then so be it.

35:11.242 --> 35:12.510
There's just one problem.

35:13.778 --> 35:15.480
You're not Robin.

35:15.580 --> 35:17.748
Having some secret tech
basement doesn't mean
that you're ready

with a cape.

35:19.450 --> 35:21.352
I mean, hell, I was literally
born to do this,

35:21.452 --> 35:24.255
and I still ended up
training my whole life.

35:24.322 --> 35:26.090
And even with that,
there's no guarantee

35:26.157 --> 35:27.658
that I'll be able
to make a difference.

35:27.758 --> 35:28.960
At least you'll have tried.

35:29.026 --> 35:30.461
Hank wasn't born to be Hawk.

35:30.528 --> 35:31.696
He just knew that was his path.

35:31.796 --> 35:32.930
So he followed it.

35:32.997 --> 35:34.198
Hank knew what
he was getting into.

35:34.298 --> 35:35.333
You may think you do,

35:35.433 --> 35:37.702
but you've got
no fucking idea.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.837
And he would tell you
the same thing if he was here.

35:39.937 --> 35:41.205
No, he wouldn't.

35:41.305 --> 35:43.374
He'd roll the dice
and give me a chance.

35:43.474 --> 35:45.209
Yeah, well, he's dead.
So, I win.

35:45.309 --> 35:46.978
Win what? When we were
on that train,

35:47.044 --> 35:48.212
I fought to get back here

35:48.312 --> 35:50.948
because I have to pursue
my destiny.

35:51.015 --> 35:53.351
You may not think I'm meant
to be the next Robin,

35:54.185 --> 35:55.386
but I know I am.

35:57.321 --> 35:59.624
I'm asking you
to believe in me.

36:01.893 --> 36:03.227
Just give me a chance.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.867
Sorry.

36:09.967 --> 36:11.569
Your destiny will have to wait.

36:20.678 --> 36:22.747
Uh, keep in mind,
for the orb to be viable--

36:22.847 --> 36:25.850
The heat and pressure
have to be maintained
at 3,000 degrees Celsius

36:25.917 --> 36:28.819

or the molecules
become unstable

36:28.886 --> 36:31.088

36:31.189 --> 36:34.158
Believe it or not,
I don't need the idiot
who destroyed this stuff

how not to screw it up.

37:30.982 --> 37:32.750
Who took you there?

37:32.817 --> 37:34.986
I don't know. Gar and Rachel
were there when I came out.

We don't have time.
I need your help.

Crane is operating.

Something about an attack
you and Bruce stopped
a long time ago.

38:36.847 --> 38:38.282
Years ago, Crane sent a poem

to Jim Gordon with clues
about an attack on Gotham.

to release his fear toxin.

38:43.854 --> 38:46.624
We stopped him before
he had a chance to set it off.

38:46.691 --> 38:50.728
Bruce to Crane's weapons
and put them in the Gotham
Armory to study them.

38:50.828 --> 38:52.296
And Crane is in the Batcave.

38:52.363 --> 38:53.864
So he knows where
those weapons are.

38:55.032 --> 38:56.367
And so do we now.

38:58.135 --> 38:59.337
We need to go.

be a Titan again.
