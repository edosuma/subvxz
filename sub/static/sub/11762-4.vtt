WEBVTT

00:00.531 --> 00:07.007
в™Єв™Є

00:07.007 --> 00:10.010
LOOK AT ALL THESE CUTE
LITTLE CRACKS ON YOUR HEELS.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.783
MY FEET HAVE HAD SOME
EXPERIENCE, OKAY, JOSH?

00:12.783 --> 00:16.016
THEY'VE SEEN THINGS.
I DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING BAD.

00:16.016 --> 00:19.019
(laughs) I SO DON'T CARE.
SERIOUSLY.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.251
OH, BOY.

00:20.251 --> 00:22.493
(telephone rings)

00:22.493 --> 00:23.494
(beep)

00:23.494 --> 00:26.127
HELLO?
WHY ARE YOU OUT OF BREATH?

00:26.127 --> 00:28.629
'CAUSE I'M SANDING DOWN
MY DISGUSTING ELEPHANT HEELS.

00:28.629 --> 00:32.103
UGH! WITH ALL THE SHAVINGS HERE,
I COULD MAKE ANOTHER FOOT.

00:32.103 --> 00:34.165
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
FOREPLAY.

00:34.165 --> 00:36.437
OH, THAT'S THE STUFF.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.739
I GAVE ANDY HIS TWO FREE
SEX CARDS FOR THE MONTH,

00:38.739 --> 00:41.742
AND HE'S ALREADY
CASHING ONE IN.
WORK THE ASS.

00:41.742 --> 00:43.114
FINE.

00:43.114 --> 00:45.116
OH, MY GOD.
TURN ON CHANNEL 30.

00:45.116 --> 00:47.448
THERE ARE WOMEN WHO DIDN'T KNOW
THEY WERE PREGNANT

00:47.448 --> 00:50.181
HAVING BABIES IN TOILETS.
REALLY?

00:50.181 --> 00:52.753
NO. WRAP IT UP.
IT'S MAGIC TIME.
(remote thuds)

00:52.753 --> 00:55.256
YOU KNOW THE DEAL. NORMALLY,
I DECIDE IF WE HAVE SEX,

00:55.256 --> 00:57.258
BUT IF ANDY
USES ONE OF HIS CARDS,

00:57.258 --> 01:00.091
I CAN'T SAY NO UNLESS
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY OR HE'S HIT ME.

01:00.091 --> 01:02.593
YOU CAN STAY ON THE PHONE
IF YOU WANT...

01:02.593 --> 01:05.836
(grunts) BUT I'M STARTING.
HEY, YOU WANT TO HOLD ON
FOR A FEW MINUTES?

01:05.836 --> 01:08.499
CALL ME BACK.
BABIES IN TOILETS!

01:10.101 --> 01:11.442
OOH!

01:11.442 --> 01:12.773
YES!

01:12.773 --> 01:15.106
COME HERE, LITTLE GUY.

01:15.106 --> 01:17.178
HEY, JULES!
OH!

01:17.178 --> 01:18.809
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

01:18.809 --> 01:21.382
OH, I CAME BY TO, UH,
GET MY SAW OUT OF THE CLOSET.

01:21.382 --> 01:24.155
YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY HOT
SLEEPING ON THE BOAT,

01:24.155 --> 01:28.159
AND I NEED A WINDOW,
LIKE, PRONTO.
I THOUGHT THAT WHEN WE GOT
DIVORCED I WOULD FINALLY BE ABLE

01:28.159 --> 01:30.561
TO ENJOY MY NIGHT SNACKS
WITHOUT YOU RUINING IT.

01:30.561 --> 01:33.294
HOW CAN I RUIN IT?
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THOSE THINGS

01:33.294 --> 01:35.526
IS LIKE EATING
THREE DOUBLE CHEESEBURGERS?

01:35.526 --> 01:37.228
AND THERE IT IS.

01:37.228 --> 01:39.200
UGH!

01:39.200 --> 01:41.432
(thud)
ARE YOU HAPPY?

01:41.432 --> 01:44.104
I'M JUST GONNA GO AND...

01:44.104 --> 01:45.436
(licks)

01:45.436 --> 01:48.108
HEY, J-BIRD, I'M SORRY.
GET OUT!

01:49.440 --> 01:52.583
HEY, PAPER BUDDY.

01:52.583 --> 01:55.746
I JUST DID BACK-TO-BACK-TO-BACK
SPINNING CLASSES.

01:55.746 --> 01:57.248
THE FIRST TWO WERE

01:57.248 --> 01:59.790
FOR THIS BIG HONKING STICKY BUN
I ATE LAST NIGHT,

01:59.790 --> 02:01.852
AND THE OTHER ONE'S
FOR LICKING THE FROSTING

02:01.852 --> 02:04.795
OFF MY MICROWAVE TRAY
THIS MORNING.
WHY NOT JUST SKIP
THE STICKY BUN?

02:04.795 --> 02:07.658
WELL, THAT'S JUST CRAZY TALK.
(car alarm chirps)

02:09.600 --> 02:12.163
(singsong voice) OH, LOOK WHO
GOT LAID LAST NIGHT.

02:12.163 --> 02:13.664
THAT'S RIGHT, CHUMPS.

02:13.664 --> 02:15.806
MISSIONARY ACCOMPLISHED. BOW!

02:15.806 --> 02:18.209
OH, MARRIED SEX.
YOU KNOW, WE'RE LUCKY.

02:18.209 --> 02:20.511
(car door shuts)
WE'RE BOTH DIVORCED
AND ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH

02:20.511 --> 02:23.214
NOT TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT.
YOU THINK I'M ATTRACTIVE?

02:23.214 --> 02:25.876
I SAID WE'RE BOTH ATTRACTIVE.
YEAH, BUT I'M PART OF "BOTH,"
RIGHT?

02:25.876 --> 02:28.719
ALL RIGHT, SO I THINK
YOU'RE ATTRACTIVE,

02:28.719 --> 02:31.352
JUST LIKE YOU THINK
I'M ATTRACTIVE.
MM, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE ATTRACTIVE.

02:31.352 --> 02:34.685
I AM SURE THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE
WHO THINK YOU'RE ATTRACTIVE,

02:34.685 --> 02:37.688
JUST NOT ME.
WELL, THEN I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE ATTRACTIVE.

02:37.688 --> 02:41.192
MM, NO TAKE BACKS.
OF COURSE THERE'S TAKE BACKS.
THERE'S ALWAYS TAKE BACKS.

02:41.192 --> 02:42.693
NOPE.
WH--

02:42.693 --> 02:45.496
SO WHAT'S THE BIG EMERGENCY?
THIS IS ONLY, LIKE,

02:45.496 --> 02:49.169
10% OF THE CRAP THAT
YOU STILL HAVE IN THIS HOUSE.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.172
HEY!
IT'S MY DRIVER'S LICENSE.
UGH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
I WAS MARRIED

02:52.172 --> 02:56.207
TO A MAN WHO KEEPS
HIS LICENSE IN A BOX.
A BOX MARKED "IMPORTANT."

02:56.207 --> 02:59.450
IT'S LIKE YOU STILL LIVE HERE.
IS THIS ONE OF THOSE TIMES WHEN
YOU'RE PISSED AT SOMEONE ELSE

02:59.450 --> 03:02.653
AND YOU'RE TAKING IT OUT
ON ME?
MAYBE. LOOK, I AM MAD

03:02.653 --> 03:05.286
ABOUT A VERY COMPLICATED
TAKE BACK SITUATION.

03:05.286 --> 03:08.859
BUT OUR MARRIAGE IS OVER. I JUST
WANT THIS STUFF OUTTA HERE.

03:08.859 --> 03:10.861
CONSIDER IT DONE.

03:10.861 --> 03:14.795
THANK YOU.
HOT DAMN!
BABY, YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?

03:14.795 --> 03:18.229
"BOBBY AND JULES DOINK."
I GUESS IT'S OUR OLD SEX TAPE.

03:18.229 --> 03:20.431
(laughs) THIS GOES
IN THE KEEP PILE, MY DEAR.

03:20.431 --> 03:24.375
NO! YOU WOULD SHOW IT
TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS. UNH-UNH.

03:24.375 --> 03:25.906
(Bobby and Jules laugh)

03:25.906 --> 03:29.380
WOW. BUTT-NAKED 19-YEAR-OLD YOU
IS STUPID HOT!

03:29.380 --> 03:32.383
LOOK AT MY BOOBS! WOW.
I THINK THEY WERE SO BIG

03:32.383 --> 03:35.386
'CAUSE I WAS NINE WEEKS PREGNANT
WITH TRAVIS WHEN WE MADE THIS.

03:35.386 --> 03:37.588
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IT YET,

03:37.588 --> 03:41.622
SO THAT'S WHY
I WAS DRINKING BEER.
MM. THAT'S A GOOD POINT,
I COULD BE PREGNANT RIGHT NOW.

03:41.622 --> 03:44.825
PAY ATTENTION TO THIS PART. THIS
IS WHERE I'M DANCING ON THE BED.
OH, A RUNNING MAN.

03:44.825 --> 03:47.498
CUTE.
AND, UH, STOP.

03:47.498 --> 03:49.800
(tape stops)
AFTER THAT, IT GETS
ALL INTERCOURSE-Y.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.763
OH, NO ONE WANTS THAT.
NO.

03:52.763 --> 03:55.606
(doorbell rings)
OH, PIZZA TIME.

03:55.606 --> 03:56.937
WAIT. WHAT?

03:56.937 --> 03:59.340
PLEASE.
YOU KNOW YOU WANT ME TO.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.512
(tape starts)

04:01.512 --> 04:04.675
YOU KNOW, IN A WEIRD WAY,

04:04.675 --> 04:07.678
THIS IS ACTUALLY
KIND OF SWEET AND--
(thud)

04:07.678 --> 04:10.250
(Bobby) OH, BABE!
(both) OH!

04:10.250 --> 04:12.483
OH, MY GOD!
I'VE EATEN OFF THAT TABLE!

04:12.483 --> 04:14.825
STOP HURTING JULES!

04:14.825 --> 04:17.688
YOU TURNED IT BACK ON?
STOP IT!

04:17.688 --> 04:20.631
WE CAN'T.
WELL, THEN STOP LOOKING AT IT!

04:20.631 --> 04:23.634
I CAN'T STOP LOOKING.
GOD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

04:23.634 --> 04:25.866
WE WERE IN LOVE.
(gasps) OH!

04:25.866 --> 04:28.539
OH, TRAVIS.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS WATCHING?

04:28.539 --> 04:30.040
NEWS.
"TOOTSIE."

04:30.040 --> 04:31.872
TV's BROKEN.

04:31.872 --> 04:32.973
"TOOTSIE."

04:34.975 --> 04:37.277
PIZZA'S ON THE FLOOR.

04:43.614 --> 04:46.757
OH, HONEY, THIS IS SO SAD.

04:46.757 --> 04:48.018
WHAT?

04:48.018 --> 04:50.961
I'M JUST TAKING OUT
THE TRASH.

04:50.961 --> 04:53.764
AND IF MY NEIGHBOR HAPPENS
TO FIND ME ATTRACTIVE,

04:53.764 --> 04:55.996
THEN, WELL, I WIN.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.298
WIN WHAT?

04:58.298 --> 05:01.932
I DON'T KNOW.
STOP ASKING STUPID QUESTIONS.

05:01.932 --> 05:04.605
SWEETIE, NOBODY WEARS BOOB TAPE
BEFORE 10:00 A.M.

05:04.605 --> 05:07.007
SHH. SHH. SHH.

05:12.583 --> 05:14.044
(cans clatter)

05:14.044 --> 05:15.946
BRAVO! AGAIN!

05:15.946 --> 05:18.048
I KNOW YOU THINK I'M CUTE.

05:18.048 --> 05:21.452
YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO SAY IT.
WELL, I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

05:21.452 --> 05:23.954
OH, GREAT. IT'S PROBABLY
NOT INSANE AT ALL.

05:23.954 --> 05:27.798
EVERY NIGHT AT 10:00 SHARP,
I'M GONNA LOOK OUT MY WINDOW,

05:27.798 --> 05:29.800
AND IF YOUR PORCH LIGHT IS ON,

05:29.800 --> 05:32.803
I'M GONNA KNOW THAT'S A SIGNAL
THAT YOU THINK I'M ATTRACTIVE.

05:32.803 --> 05:34.735
AND YOU'LL NEVER HAVE
TO SAY IT TO MY FACE.

05:34.735 --> 05:37.568
YOU'VE GOT OLD NOODLES
ALL IN YOUR HAIR AND...

05:37.568 --> 05:41.111
(singsong voice) OH! SOMEBODY'S
OBSESSED WITH MY HAIR!

05:41.111 --> 05:44.344
(normal voice)
SEE YOU AT 10:00, BUDDY BOY!

05:49.349 --> 05:53.053
HOW'D IT GO?
HE'S A JERK, AND MY HAIR
SMELLS LIKE PAD THAI.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.085
ARE YOU WATCHING
MY SEX TAPE?

05:55.085 --> 05:57.628
YEAH, BUT WITH THE VOLUME DOWN,
SO IT'S NOT WEIRD.

05:57.628 --> 06:00.130
IT'S STILL WEIRD.
(turns off TV)

06:00.130 --> 06:04.064
YOU KNOW, I USED TO BE THAT
YOUNG AND HOT, AND NOW AT NIGHT,

06:04.064 --> 06:06.737
I SIT IN FRONT
OF THAT DAMN MAGNIFYING MIRROR

06:06.737 --> 06:10.070
AND PICK AT THINGS
THAT DON'T NEED TO BE PICKED,

06:10.070 --> 06:13.073
AND ALL I SEE STARING BACK AT ME
IS A BIG PILE OF OLD.

06:13.073 --> 06:16.076
HONEY, IT IS NOT YOU.
IT'S THAT DAMN LITTLE MIRROR.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.948
LOOK. MINE'S RIGHT HERE.
I SPENT THE WHOLE MORNING

06:17.948 --> 06:19.950
IN THE BATHROOM
JUST STARING AT MYSELF,

06:19.950 --> 06:21.952
AND THEN I GOT HUNGRY,
SO I CAME DOWN HERE

06:21.952 --> 06:24.955
AND POKED AT MY FACE
WHILE I ATE A BAGEL.
YOU KNOW,
SOME MIRRORS ARE FRIENDS.

06:24.955 --> 06:27.718
THAT BIG ONE IN MY CLOSET LET ME
WEAR WHITE PANTS TODAY.

06:27.718 --> 06:30.390
WELL, NOT THIS ONE.
THIS ONE IS EVIL.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.493
OH, GOD. I HAVE
SO MANY CHIN WHISKERS.

06:32.493 --> 06:34.495
I LOOK LIKE CARNY FOLK.

06:34.495 --> 06:37.528
SO MANY TIMES, I JUST WANT
TO THROW THIS THING OUT.

06:39.930 --> 06:42.503
DON'T.
I HAVE TO.
GIVE ME SOME TWEEZERS.

06:42.503 --> 06:45.005
SALAD TONGS. SOMETHING.

06:45.005 --> 06:48.178
SO WHERE ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO PUT ALL THIS STUFF?

06:48.178 --> 06:50.741
ALL THE ESSENTIALS
STAY ONBOARD.

06:50.741 --> 06:53.744
EVERYTHING ELSE--WELL...

06:53.744 --> 06:56.016
NO ONE GOES BEHIND
THAT GARAGE MUCH, SO...

06:56.016 --> 06:59.019
SO AS A GROWN MAN, YOU THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO STORE

06:59.019 --> 07:01.191
MOST OF YOUR EARTHLY POSSESSIONS
IN THE WOODS?

07:01.191 --> 07:03.954
CALM DOWN. WHAT'S A SQUIRREL
GONNA DO WITH A BLENDER?

07:03.954 --> 07:05.826
MM-HMM.
OOH!

07:05.826 --> 07:07.427
(laughs) NO WAY!

07:07.427 --> 07:10.501
MY OLD CHEETO. MAN, THIS
THING'S, LIKE, 15 YEARS OLD.

07:10.501 --> 07:12.663
IT SAVED IT 'CAUSE IT LOOKS
EXACTLY LIKE BRUCE WILLIS.

07:12.663 --> 07:15.806
IT MUST BE WORTH, LIKE, THREE
TIMES ITS ORIGINAL VALUE NOW.

07:15.806 --> 07:18.208
TRAV, I DARE YOU TO EAT IT.

07:18.208 --> 07:20.971
WHAT? NO.
COME ON, LITTLE BUDDY.

07:20.971 --> 07:23.974
MY DADDY USED TO DARE ME
TO EAT THINGS ALL THE TIME.

07:23.974 --> 07:26.617
I MEAN, I ATE FOUR BOTTLE CAPS
ONCE. THREE HAVE NOT PASSED,

07:26.617 --> 07:29.119
AND I'M COOL WITH THAT,
'CAUSE DOING THINGS WITH MY POPS

07:29.119 --> 07:32.122
MADE ME THE MAN I AM TODAY.
WELL,
THAT'S A GREAT SELL, DAD,

07:32.122 --> 07:35.155
BUT I'M STILL LEANING
TOWARD "NO."

07:35.155 --> 07:37.958
COME ON. ONE TIME.
NO. NO. NO. NO.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.960
(horn honks)

07:39.960 --> 07:43.063
WHOO! I'D LIKE TO BE
YOUR BIKE SEAT!

07:43.063 --> 07:44.134
(horn honks)
LAURIE!

07:44.134 --> 07:46.466
WHAT? (laughs) IT'S FUN.

07:46.466 --> 07:50.200
YOU DO IT. OOH, OOH, OOH.
COME ON. THERE'S A HOT JOGGER.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.102
(horn honks)
OH, FINE.

07:52.102 --> 07:55.746
HEY, SWEET CHEEKS!
COME TO MAMA!

07:55.746 --> 07:58.509
(laughs)

07:58.509 --> 08:01.512
(gasps) GO! GO!
GO! GO! GO! GO! GO!
I CAN'T!

08:01.512 --> 08:04.014
LAURIE, COME ON!
(horns honking)

08:04.014 --> 08:05.986
WELL, HEY, LAURIE.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.559
MAMA.
I DIDN'T MEAN WHAT I SAID.

08:08.559 --> 08:12.923
NO, NO, NO. THEY REALLY ARE
VERY, VERY SWEET CHEEKS.

08:12.923 --> 08:15.025
HEY, MAYBE THIS WILL HELP
PASS THE TIME,

08:15.025 --> 08:17.898
IF I JUST... OH! OOH!

08:17.898 --> 08:19.900
SO COOL ON THE SKIN.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.072
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE JUST AN ARROGANT JERK

08:22.072 --> 08:25.005
WHO LEFT HIS WIFE TO HAVE SEX
WITH TEENAGERS.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.839
GUILTY. BUT IT IS KOOKY HOW MANY
WOMEN FIND ME ATTRACTIVE.

08:28.839 --> 08:31.511
I MEAN, THEY RANGE IN AGE
FROM 18 ALL THE WAY UP

08:31.511 --> 08:33.584
TO, LIKE--
WELL, HOW OLD ARE YOU?

08:33.584 --> 08:36.286
(gasps)
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
I'M WALKING, LAURIE.

08:36.286 --> 08:39.820
SEE YOU AT THE OFFICE.
EXCUSE ME.
(car door shuts)

08:39.820 --> 08:42.152
SO WHICH WAY ARE WE GOING?

08:42.152 --> 08:46.597
YOU WANT ME TO WALK AHEAD
SO YOU CAN LOOK AT MY BUNS?
UGH.

08:46.597 --> 08:49.529
DIDN'T THINK THAT ONE THROUGH,
DID YOU?

08:49.529 --> 08:51.101
QUIET TIME.

08:54.735 --> 08:58.168
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:58.168 --> 09:00.941
UH, GETTING THE CAMCORDER.

09:00.941 --> 09:04.775
(dog barking in distance)

09:04.775 --> 09:07.918
I KNEW I'D REGRET TELLING YOU
ABOUT JULES' SEX TAPE.

09:07.918 --> 09:10.250
SEX TAPE? WH-WH-WH...
(stammers)
IT'S NOT HAPPENING, ANDY.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.122
COME ON!

09:12.122 --> 09:14.324
GRAYSON THINKS
HE'S GOD'S GIFT TO WOMEN.

09:14.324 --> 09:17.327
I BET HE THINKS ALL WE DO IS
SIT AROUND

09:17.327 --> 09:21.091
TALKING ABOUT HIM ALL DAY,
WONDERING WHAT HE'S THINKING.
LIKE WE CARE WHAT HE THINKS.

09:21.091 --> 09:24.094
I BET HE THINKS HIS EX IS ALL
SAD AND PINING FOR HIM. AW.

09:24.094 --> 09:26.667
POOR VIVIAN.
SHE GAVE HIM HER BEST YEARS.

09:26.667 --> 09:30.100
OH, HONEY.
WERE YOU TWO CLOSE?
SO CLOSE!

09:30.100 --> 09:33.103
I WENT OVER AND BORROWED
AN ACE BANDAGE FROM HER ONCE.

09:33.103 --> 09:35.806
SHE LET ME KEEP IT.
SHE SOUNDS AMAZING.

09:35.806 --> 09:38.649
YOU KNOW,
WE SHOULD GO CHECK ON HER.

09:38.649 --> 09:42.082
YOU WANT TO GO SEE IF I THINK
YOU'RE CUTER THAN GRAYSON'S EX?
WELL, I MEAN, ONLY IF YOU DO.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.084
CUTE SHOES, GOOD SHIRT,
BAD SKIRT.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.086
GOOD SKIRT, GOOD TOP,
BAD SHOES.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.789
ARE YOU HAVING A SEIZURE?
PLEASE FOCUS.

09:48.789 --> 09:51.091
COME ON, VIVIAN.
GO ON YOUR LUNCH BREAK.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.163
I'VE NEVER STALKED ANYONE
BEFORE.

09:53.163 --> 09:54.765
WELL, ONE TIME

09:54.765 --> 09:57.167
I TRACKED DOWN THIS CHICK
THAT SLEPT WITH MY BOYFRIEND,

09:57.167 --> 10:00.130
STOLE HER IDENTITY AND GOT HER
KICKED OUT OF COLLEGE.

10:00.130 --> 10:03.273
DOES THAT COUNT?
I DON'T HAVE TO KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT YOU, OKAY, LAURIE?

10:03.273 --> 10:06.036
OKAY.
(door bells jingle)

10:06.036 --> 10:08.108
OH, THIS MIGHT BE HER.
YOU ARE WAY CUTER THAN SHE IS.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.641
YOU'RE NOT EVEN LOOKING,
JUST DOING MY JOB. OH, WOW!

10:10.641 --> 10:13.013
SEE? YOU DO THINK
SHE'S PRETTIER THAN ME.

10:13.013 --> 10:16.016
(laughs)
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT
VIVIAN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.648
SHE FLAUNTS IT, LAURIE.

10:17.648 --> 10:21.191
THE ENTIRE BLOCK THOUGHT
SHE WAS A GIANT BITCH.
JULES! LOOK.

10:23.654 --> 10:26.226
OH, I'M SO HAPPY FOR HER.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.628
PREGGERS AND ENGAGED?

10:28.628 --> 10:31.962
OH, I'D LOVE TO RUB IT
IN HIS FACE.
SO DO IT.

10:31.962 --> 10:34.234
NO. THAT'S TOO MEAN.
BUT HE'S BEEN TORTURING YOU.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.236
AND BEING MEAN
IS SUCH A RUSH.

10:36.236 --> 10:39.239
IT'S LIKE THAT FEELING YOU GET
WHEN SOMEONE LOSES WEIGHT,

10:39.239 --> 10:43.674
AND THEN THEY BRAG ABOUT IT,
AND THEN THEY GAIN IT ALL BACK.

10:43.674 --> 10:46.677
OHH!
(laughs)

10:46.677 --> 10:48.648
OH.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.881
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
HOW TO BE MEAN?

10:50.881 --> 10:53.153
HELL, YEAH! WHEN SOMEONE
GETS BUGGY WITH ME,

10:53.153 --> 10:54.855
YOU KNOW WHAT I DO?

10:54.855 --> 10:56.356
I DON'T.
NO.

10:56.356 --> 10:59.129
WELL, FIRST IF SOMEONE
HURTS MY FEELINGS,

10:59.129 --> 11:02.062
I GET REALLY, REALLY SAD
FOR TWO DAYS,

11:02.062 --> 11:04.064
BUT, UM, THEN--THEN I ACT
INSANELY NICE TO THEM

11:04.064 --> 11:06.236
SO THEY FEEL TOTALLY GUILTY.
DOES THAT WORK?

11:06.236 --> 11:08.739
I LIKE TO THINK
IT STINGS A LITTLE.

11:08.739 --> 11:12.072
JULES, IF YOU DON'T TORCH
THIS COCKY BASTARD, THEN I WILL.
NO, NO. I WANT TO DO IT.

11:12.072 --> 11:15.045
WHAT IS THIS WEIRD MIRROR?
NO, NO. STAY AWAY FROM IT.

11:15.045 --> 11:17.207
OH, MY GOD!

11:17.207 --> 11:19.910
MY PORES LOOK LIKE
GIANT BULLET HOLES!

11:19.910 --> 11:22.352
I SEE A LITTLE MUSTACHE.

11:22.352 --> 11:25.956
WHERE DID THIS WOMAN GO?

11:25.956 --> 11:28.188
COME ON.
YOU STILL LOOK LIKE THAT.

11:28.188 --> 11:31.922
SHOULD I JUST STOP OBSESSING
ABOUT HOW MUCH OLDER I LOOK?

11:31.922 --> 11:36.066
YES, BECAUSE YOU ARE
A STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

11:36.066 --> 11:37.397
WRONG.

11:37.397 --> 11:40.771
THE CORRECT RESPONSE IS
"YOU DON'T LOOK ANY OLDER."

11:40.771 --> 11:44.074
THAT WAS A TRAP.
WE'RE NOT GONNA DO THIS.

11:44.074 --> 11:46.236
IN FACT...

11:46.236 --> 11:49.379
I'D LIKE
TO USE MY LAST CARD.

11:49.379 --> 11:53.143
YOUR CARDS ARE
NO LONGER HONORED

11:53.143 --> 11:56.246
AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.897
(gasps)

12:06.897 --> 12:08.899
(bottles clink)
IF YOU WERE MY SON,

12:08.899 --> 12:12.863
AND I REALLY WANTED YOU
TO EAT THIS, WOULD YOU?
YES, OUT OF LOVE.

12:12.863 --> 12:15.465
EXACTLY.
ONE COSMO, YOU JERK.

12:15.465 --> 12:16.867
OKAY.

12:16.867 --> 12:18.068
в™Єв™Є

12:18.068 --> 12:21.241
SO I'M GUESSING JULES
SHOWED YOU OUR SEX TAPE?

12:21.241 --> 12:24.144
YEP.
DID SHE SHOW YOU
THE PART WHEN--

12:24.144 --> 12:26.416
YEP. IT NEVER GOES AWAY.

12:26.416 --> 12:28.048
(mouths word)

12:28.048 --> 12:30.350
HERE YOU GO, ANGRY CHICK.

12:30.350 --> 12:34.154
I HOPE YOU WERE SMART ENOUGH
TO SNAG YOUR SEX TAPES

12:34.154 --> 12:37.858
BEFORE YOU LEFT YOUR WIFE.
AH, I DIDN'T LEAVE HER.
SHE LEFT ME.

12:37.858 --> 12:40.190
WHY?
OH, I WANTED KIDS,
AND SHE DIDN'T.

12:40.190 --> 12:42.492
IT'S ONE OF THOSE PROBLEMS
YOU JUST CAN'T FIX.

12:42.492 --> 12:45.065
SO SHE LEFT.

12:46.336 --> 12:48.138
IT SUCKED.

12:48.138 --> 12:50.140
(singsong voice)
GUESS WHO I SAW TODAY!

12:50.140 --> 12:52.843
(slow motion voice) NO!

12:52.843 --> 12:56.907
YOUR EX-WIFE--SHE'S HAPPY,
SHE'S ENGAGED AND GET THIS--

12:56.907 --> 12:58.508
SHE'S PREGGERS.
(sighs)

13:02.883 --> 13:04.184
BURN ON WHO? HUH?

13:04.184 --> 13:07.087
I SAY BURN ON YOU, PAL!

13:07.087 --> 13:08.158
(slaps counter)

13:08.158 --> 13:11.021
HOW'D I DO?

13:17.027 --> 13:18.999
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THAT.

13:18.999 --> 13:21.131
I FEEL SO GUILTY,
I COULD ACTUALLY CRY.

13:21.131 --> 13:25.275
WHY ARE YOU EATING LIKE THAT?
IT TASTES BETTER THIS WAY.
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

13:25.275 --> 13:28.208
AND STOP WATCHING ME EAT. I
THOUGHT WE HAD AN UNDERSTANDING.

13:28.208 --> 13:31.341
NO. I CAN EAT JUNK FOOD
IN FRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE.

13:31.341 --> 13:33.884
OH, YAY FOR YOU, LAURIE.
TURN AROUND.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.948
NICE BITE.
WHAT ARE YOU, A WOLF?

13:37.948 --> 13:39.419
I JUST WANT MY TREAT.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.421
YOUR SEX TAPE
RUINED MY MARRIAGE.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.593
MY HUSBAND AND I
WILL NEVER HAVE SEX AGAIN

13:43.593 --> 13:46.826
BECAUSE OF YOU AND YOUR STUPID,
HOT, 20-YEAR-OLD BODY.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.959
IT MADE ME HATE MY ANCIENT,

13:48.959 --> 13:52.062
SAGGY, 40-YEAR-OLD,
TRAIN-WRECK BODY.

13:52.062 --> 13:53.503
DON'T WATCH ME EAT.

13:55.565 --> 13:57.968
TURN AWAY. TURN AWAY.
SHE'S WAY WORSE THAN ME.

13:57.968 --> 13:59.269
SHE GETS VIOLENT.

13:59.269 --> 14:02.272
EEK.
OKAY, I'M GONNA GO TALK
TO GRAYSON.

14:02.272 --> 14:04.915
WILL YOU MAKE SURE
ELLIE'S OKAY?
I HATE HER.

14:04.915 --> 14:06.917
OH, COME ON.
WAY DEEP DOWN INSIDE,

14:06.917 --> 14:09.079
YOU MUST LIKE HER A LITTLE,
RIGHT?
I DON'T THINK I DO.

14:09.079 --> 14:13.123
YOU STAY HERE FOR 30 MINUTES,
I'LL GIVE YOU FRIDAY OFF.

14:13.123 --> 14:15.085
HEY.

14:15.085 --> 14:16.386
YOU WANT TO TALK?

14:16.386 --> 14:20.160
(mouth full)
I SAID DON'T WATCH ME EAT!
OW! OW!

14:22.132 --> 14:25.365
IT'S SO AWESOME
THAT YOU DRIVE A GOLF CART,

14:25.365 --> 14:28.638
'CAUSE THAT WAY, WE GET
TO MAKE, LIKE, 9,000 TRIPS.

14:28.638 --> 14:30.000
DAD?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.372
(singsong voice) DAD?

14:32.372 --> 14:36.146
(high-pitched voice) HI, JUNIOR.
I WAS MARRIED TO DEMI MOORE.

14:36.146 --> 14:38.348
I'M NOT EATING IT.

14:38.348 --> 14:40.510
FINE.

14:40.510 --> 14:42.312
I'LL EAT IT THEN.

14:42.312 --> 14:44.014
(grunts)

14:44.014 --> 14:46.316
(crunches)
SEE? NO BIG DEAL.

14:46.316 --> 14:48.888
I JUST WANTED US TO... UGH!

14:48.888 --> 14:50.420
(gags)

14:50.420 --> 14:53.623
HORRIBLE.

14:53.623 --> 14:56.626
I JUST WANTED US TO HAVE
A THING LIKE ME AND MY DAD.

14:56.626 --> 14:59.169
NOW YOU DON'T LIKE GOLF,
YOU DON'T LIKE BOATS,

14:59.169 --> 15:00.530
YOU DON'T LIKE PLAYING

15:00.530 --> 15:03.233
"LET'S THROW THINGS
AT EACH OTHER'S NUTS."

15:03.233 --> 15:06.306
I MEAN, SOMETIMES I WONDER
WHAT PART OF YOU IS ME.
COME ON. I JUST--

15:06.306 --> 15:08.308
NOT NOW. I GOTTA GO HARF.
(coughs)

15:19.249 --> 15:21.952
HOW YOU DOING?
SO GREAT.

15:21.952 --> 15:23.994
I'M SO SORRY
I WAS THE ONE TO,

15:23.994 --> 15:25.996
WELL, BREAK THE NEWS
ABOUT VIVIAN.

15:25.996 --> 15:29.059
NO, NO, I'M GLAD
IT CAME FROM YOU.
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

15:29.059 --> 15:31.161
I REALLY DON'T.

15:31.161 --> 15:33.463
OKAY, LOOK,
WE CAN EITHER TALK THIS OUT,

15:33.463 --> 15:36.166
OR I COULD JUST NEVER SPEAK
TO YOU AGAIN.

15:36.166 --> 15:39.339
I SHOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN THAT
AS AN OPTION.

15:42.973 --> 15:45.475
WHAT?!

15:45.475 --> 15:47.217
AND B.T.W., SHE HIT ME.

15:47.217 --> 15:49.719
SHE WAS WATCHING ME EAT.
I WAS NOT WATCHING YOU EAT.

15:49.719 --> 15:52.182
I SAW YOU--
YOU--
YOU DON'T WATCH PEOPLE EAT.

15:52.182 --> 15:55.155
IT MAKES US WANT TO CRY.

15:55.155 --> 15:58.288
AND YOU, ELLIE TORRES--
YOU ARE A FOXY TREAT.

15:58.288 --> 16:01.631
YOUR OPINION MEANS NOTHING.
YOU'RE ALWAYS NICE TO ME.

16:01.631 --> 16:05.165
OKAY, LAURIE ISN'T. LAURIE,
SAY SOMETHING NICE TO ELLIE.

16:05.165 --> 16:09.539
I CAN'T.
ADMIT IT. YOU KNOW SHE IS
A SMOKING PIECE OF ASS.

16:09.539 --> 16:11.341
UGH. FINE.

16:11.341 --> 16:16.206
SHE'S HOT FOR A FRIGID,
BEASTLY, ELDERLY WOMAN.

16:16.206 --> 16:18.008
YOU THINK I'M HOT?

16:18.008 --> 16:19.449
THAT WORKED?

16:19.449 --> 16:22.282
WELL, YEAH, BECAUSE IF THAT
TRASHY, BIG-LIPPED SLAG SAID IT,

16:22.282 --> 16:24.514
IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE TRUE.

16:24.514 --> 16:27.157
YOU THINK I HAVE BIG LIPS?
THAT'S REALLY SWEET.

16:27.157 --> 16:29.289
(cell phone beeps)
ALL RIGHT.
MY 30 MINUTES IS UP.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.561
I'M OUT. BYE, JULES.
LATER, GRANDMA.

16:31.561 --> 16:34.194
OH, HEY, JULES.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.666
ARE YOU REALLY IN MY BEDROOM
WATCHING OUR TAPE?

16:36.666 --> 16:39.629
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,
IS THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENING?
CALM DOWN.

16:39.629 --> 16:42.532
I WAS JUST PACKING UP THE LAST
OF MY STUFF AND I GOT NOSTALGIC.

16:42.532 --> 16:45.135
I MEAN, IGNORE US
GOING AT IT FOR A SECOND

16:45.135 --> 16:47.637
AND LOOK AT OUR OLD APARTMENT.
YOU REMEMBER THAT NASTY COUCH?

16:47.637 --> 16:50.040
WE FOUND THAT ON THE STREET.

16:50.040 --> 16:53.043
YOU JUST CAN'T FIND GOOD
FURNITURE ON THE STREET ANYMORE.

16:53.043 --> 16:56.146
(laughs)
OH, AND THERE'S
OUR ONE BATHROOM.

16:56.146 --> 16:59.219
IT DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A DOOR.
YOU LOVED THAT.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.251
MM. SO CONVENIENT.
(chuckles)

17:01.251 --> 17:03.753
YOU KNOW WHY I LIKE
WATCHING THIS TAPE?

17:03.753 --> 17:07.327
MM.
I LIKE REMEMBERING
ALL THIS.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.729
I LIKE SEEING US
WHEN WE WERE HAPPY TOGETHER.

17:09.729 --> 17:12.532
ME, TOO.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.464
PLUS, I LOVE IT
WHEN YOU TURN AROUND

17:14.464 --> 17:17.237
AND YOU PICK YOUR LEG UP.
(laughs)
AND I'M OUT.

17:18.768 --> 17:20.310
CAN I COME IN?

17:20.310 --> 17:23.243
"I THOUGHT YOU WERE NEVER
GOING TO TALK TO ME AGAIN,"

17:23.243 --> 17:26.246
HE SAID HOPEFULLY.
I'LL BE INSIDE.
YOU COME IN WHEN YOU'RE READY.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.277
(birds calling)

17:27.277 --> 17:29.079
OHH!

17:29.079 --> 17:30.750
WHAT THE HELL?!

17:30.750 --> 17:34.624
SORRY. I PICTURED THAT BEING
MUCH MORE OF A BONDING MOMENT.

17:34.624 --> 17:36.256
YOU GOT ME.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.288
YOU KNOW, DAD, I'M TRYING.

17:38.288 --> 17:40.790
FORGET ABOUT ALL THAT,
ALL RIGHT?

17:40.790 --> 17:42.792
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T NEED
TO HAVE A THING.

17:42.792 --> 17:44.794
JUST BECAUSE I LIKE EATING
FOSSILIZED CHEETOS

17:44.794 --> 17:47.637
DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO.
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S IT.

17:47.637 --> 17:51.101
MAYBE ME GETTING YOU TO DO
STUPID THINGS...

17:51.101 --> 17:52.802
CAN BE OUR THING.

17:52.802 --> 17:55.545
I'M LISTENING.

17:55.545 --> 17:58.808
WELL, YOU'VE GOT A REAL FLAIR
FOR DECORATING.

17:58.808 --> 18:01.211
SHE TOOK EVERYTHING.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

18:01.211 --> 18:03.853
LOOK, YOUR MARRIAGE SUCKED.

18:03.853 --> 18:07.487
THANK YOU.
AND MY MARRIAGE SUCKED.
BUT WHY WOULD YOU LET ME THINK

18:07.487 --> 18:10.490
THAT YOU'RE SOME JERK
WHO WALKED AWAY FROM HIS WIFE?

18:10.490 --> 18:12.492
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE,
FOR SOME REASON, I THOUGHT

18:12.492 --> 18:15.725
YOU'D BE REALLY ANNOYING
AND WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

18:15.725 --> 18:18.728
OR MAYBE I'D RATHER NOT RELIVE
THE SUPERFUN ADVENTURE

18:18.728 --> 18:21.301
OF HAVING SOMEONE YOU LOVE
JUST WALK AWAY.

18:21.301 --> 18:24.504
DEFINITELY
ONE OF THOSE TWO THINGS.
WELL, YOU CAN'T JUST PRETEND
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.506
ARE YOU SURE?
BECAUSE I'M PRETENDING

18:26.506 --> 18:28.878
THAT THIS CONVERSATION NEVER
HAPPENED AS IT'S HAPPENING.

18:28.878 --> 18:31.881
GRAYSON, LOOK, I KNOW WHAT IT'S
LIKE TO WANT TO ERASE YOUR PAST.

18:31.881 --> 18:33.883
I HAD BOBBY MOVE
ALL OF HIS CRAP OUT

18:33.883 --> 18:36.886
JUST SO I WOULDN'T HAVE
A DAILY REMINDER OF IT.

18:36.886 --> 18:38.888
BUT YOU CAN'T PACK AWAY
YOUR PAST IN BOXES.

18:38.888 --> 18:40.890
IT'S ALWAYS GONNA BE A PART
OF WHO YOU ARE.

18:40.890 --> 18:43.893
I MEAN, LOOK, YOU WERE TREATED
REALLY, REALLY BADLY,

18:43.893 --> 18:47.827
WHICH KIND OF JUSTIFIES
WHY YOU CAN BE SUCH A TOOL.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.830
I MEAN, DON'T GET ME WRONG,
I WAS ALSO TREATED REALLY BADLY,

18:50.830 --> 18:53.703
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I'M SUPER NICE. WHATEVER.

18:53.703 --> 18:56.336
WORST BUCK-UP SPEECH EVER.
I'M NOT DONE YET.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.338
YOU NEED TO KNOW
THAT EVENTUALLY,

18:58.338 --> 19:00.340
THIS ISN'T GONNA HURT
SO MUCH

19:00.340 --> 19:03.373
AND THE GOOD TIMES ARE JUST
GONNA GET EASIER TO REMEMBER.

19:03.373 --> 19:05.845
AND YOU'RE GONNA END UP
BEING A STRONGER PERSON

19:05.845 --> 19:08.748
BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE STUFF
THAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH.

19:08.748 --> 19:12.182
I-I PROMISE. REALLY.

19:12.182 --> 19:14.784
OH, BY THE WAY,
I HATED YOUR WIFE.

19:14.784 --> 19:17.427
SHE WAS A TOTAL BITCH.
NEEDED TO BE SAID.

19:17.427 --> 19:19.589
YOU DESERVE BETTER.

19:21.291 --> 19:26.596
ANY THOUGHTS? COMMENTS?
FEELINGS? QUESTIONS?

19:26.596 --> 19:30.240
OH, ALL RIGHT.
THEN I'LL JUST SEE MYSELF OUT.

19:30.240 --> 19:32.242
HEY, DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?

19:32.242 --> 19:35.575
NO.
THOUGHT I HEARD SOMETHIN'.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.407
SIX, SEVEN,

19:47.317 --> 19:51.261
TRAV DARED ME TO STICK THE HOSE
IN MY MOUTH FOR TEN SECONDS.
CAN I GO NEXT?

19:51.261 --> 19:53.263
IT'S KIND OF
A FATHER/SON THING.

19:54.624 --> 19:56.726
OH.

19:56.726 --> 19:58.728

20:02.232 --> 20:04.574

LIFE.

20:04.574 --> 20:09.739
MAYBE THIS WILL MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER.

20:09.739 --> 20:13.443
THANK YOU FOR ALWAYS THINKING
I'M BEAUTIFUL EVEN WHEN I DON'T.

20:13.443 --> 20:15.415

20:15.415 --> 20:17.347
YES, WHENEVER YOU LIKE--

20:17.347 --> 20:19.549

(grunts)

20:19.549 --> 20:22.452
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
NOTHING. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:22.452 --> 20:25.855
READING A BOOK. OW!

20:25.855 --> 20:30.430
HE'S FINE. I WAS CALLING YOU
BECAUSE IT'S 10:00,

20:30.430 --> 20:33.333
and I was looking outside...

20:35.535 --> 20:38.438
OH, MY GOD.
HIS PORCH LIGHT IS ON.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.370
HE ADMITTED IT.
YOU WON.

20:40.370 --> 20:42.342
I KNEW IT!

20:43.643 --> 20:45.975
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS.

20:45.975 --> 20:48.448
OKAY? THIS IS
JUST ME BEING NICE.

20:48.448 --> 20:51.321
JUST SAY IT OUT LOUD.
SAY YOU'RE ATTRACTED TO ME,

20:51.321 --> 20:53.283
AND I'LL NEVER TALK TO YOU
ABOUT IT AGAIN.

20:53.283 --> 20:56.255
LEAVE ME ALONE.
COME ON.
WHAT'S MY BEST FEATURE?

20:56.255 --> 20:59.429
IS IT MY BUTT? 'CAUSE I'VE BEEN
WORKING REALLY HARD ON MY BUTT.

21:01.331 --> 21:03.363
YES!

21:09.499 --> 21:11.801
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU LET ME TAPE US. THANK YOU.

21:11.801 --> 21:13.303
YOU'RE WELCOME.
(tape starts)

21:13.303 --> 21:16.406
THIS IS VERY EXCITING FOR ME.
I KNOW.

21:19.809 --> 21:21.811
IS MY BACK
REALLY THAT HAIRY?

21:21.811 --> 21:24.384
YES.

21:24.384 --> 21:26.386
IS THIS IN SLOW MOTION?

21:26.386 --> 21:27.457
NO.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.324
CAN WE JUST ERASE THIS?
YES.

21:34.324 --> 21:36.025

21:36.025 --> 21:38.027
NO.
(sighs)
