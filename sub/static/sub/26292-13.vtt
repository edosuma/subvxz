WEBVTT

00:03.870 --> 00:06.566
- Previously on
"New Amsterdam"...

00:06.610 --> 00:08.305
- His name was Muhammad.
He asked me to marry him.

00:08.350 --> 00:10.784
- Broke up?
- Brain aneurysm.

00:10.830 --> 00:12.218
I still miss him.

00:12.270 --> 00:13.487
- I told you about the songs
I'm writing,

00:13.530 --> 00:14.610
well, I'd love to make a demo.

00:14.660 --> 00:16.093
I was wondering if you could...

00:16.140 --> 00:17.311
- Give you money?

00:17.360 --> 00:19.271
Don't think it's a good idea.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.096
- I have plans with Ella.

00:22.150 --> 00:25.051
- Ella?
- Thanks for introducing us.

00:25.110 --> 00:28.671
- I've been taking a little bit
more Adderall than prescribed.

00:28.720 --> 00:33.066
- I think that I need to report
an impaired physician.

01:11.590 --> 01:13.364
- Don't forget to go over
the rib.

01:13.420 --> 01:16.150
The vein, the artery,
and the nerve run under, okay?

01:18.810 --> 01:20.459
What you got?

01:20.510 --> 01:22.558
- EMS notification,
diabetic coma on the way.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.204
- Ooh, sounds interesting.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.808
- I thought you had
a VIP patient?

01:25.860 --> 01:28.203
- Ah, that's after my shift.
I've got time to take one more.

01:28.260 --> 01:31.161
- Of course you do.

01:31.220 --> 01:34.383
- Allison Medrano, 68-year-old
fishing boat captain

01:34.440 --> 01:35.737
with Type II diabetes.

01:35.790 --> 01:37.132
Rescued by Coast Guard,
unconscious.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.829
Finger stick blood sugar, 745.

01:38.880 --> 01:41.132
She's received ten units
sub q times four,

01:41.180 --> 01:42.351
but she's still unresponsive.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.391
Found these in her pocket.

01:44.450 --> 01:48.409
- Diabetes meds prescribed by
a Dr. Jessica Medrano.

01:48.450 --> 01:50.702
- She's a primary care doctor
here.

01:50.760 --> 01:52.182
This could be her mom.

01:52.240 --> 01:53.628
Let's page Max and Dr. Medrano,

01:53.670 --> 01:55.888
and let's get her into
Trauma One.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.824
What are you doing?

02:17.700 --> 02:20.863
- Do you see that man?

02:20.920 --> 02:23.559
He's my son.

02:23.620 --> 02:26.134
- And you hiding all the way
over here because...

02:26.180 --> 02:27.704
- If you believe two people
are together

02:27.750 --> 02:29.798
for the wrong reason,
it's your responsibility to--

02:29.840 --> 02:31.751
- Oh, no, no.
See--no, no, nope, nope.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.279
I'm gonna stop you right there.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.185
See, as a rule,
I don't do family drama.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.231
So, if you wanna talk
about that,

02:37.280 --> 02:38.804
I recommend you talk to Iggy.

02:38.850 --> 02:41.455
- Iggy is busy all day,
and there is no family drama.

02:41.500 --> 02:42.808
- Then why are you hiding?

02:42.850 --> 02:45.728
- Because I need to see if
my son lS--

02:45.770 --> 02:47.852
- No, no.
No family drama, man.

02:47.900 --> 02:50.209
Look, my only advice for you:

02:50.250 --> 02:51.808
stay out of your boy's
dating life.

02:54.780 --> 02:56.816
Hey, you want a coffee, Vijay?
- Ooh.

02:59.520 --> 03:01.738
- Blood PH of 7.19.

03:01.790 --> 03:03.269
- Blood sugar still over 700.

03:03.310 --> 03:04.914
Injecting ten more units of
insulin.

03:06.700 --> 03:08.565
- Mom.
- Hey.

03:08.620 --> 03:09.746
- Can I get some water?

03:09.790 --> 03:11.929
- Absolutely.
Uh, Casey?

03:11.970 --> 03:13.528
- On it.

03:13.580 --> 03:16.219
- Ms. Medrano, you're at
New Amsterdam Hospital,

03:16.280 --> 03:18.714
and I will be happy to answer
any questions you might have.

03:18.760 --> 03:20.887
- Where's my boat?

03:20.930 --> 03:22.488
- Except for that one.

03:22.550 --> 03:23.801
I--I don't know what
that means.

03:23.850 --> 03:25.283
- She's captain of
a fishing boat.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.809
- Seriously?

03:26.850 --> 03:29.466
- What, you expecting
a peg leg and a parrot?

03:29.510 --> 03:32.331
- No, but, uh, that'd be cool.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.371
I just didn't realize there
were any of you left

03:34.430 --> 03:35.852
in New York City.

03:35.910 --> 03:38.424
- There's not.
Industry moved on; she didn't.

03:38.470 --> 03:39.869
- Huh.

03:39.910 --> 03:41.775
Fishing boat captain in
New York City,

03:41.830 --> 03:44.515
that--that's a throwback.

03:44.570 --> 03:47.209
What an interesting job.
- Mm-hmm.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.350
- Excuse me.

03:53.010 --> 03:54.739
- He does that sometimes.

03:56.750 --> 04:00.368
- Nourishment Consultant,
Media Distribution Ofﬁcer,

04:00.410 --> 04:01.627
pneumatic tube repair?

04:01.670 --> 04:02.796
What do these people
even do?

04:02.850 --> 04:04.363
- Aren't you
the Medical Director?

04:04.410 --> 04:05.365
Aren't you supposed to know?

04:05.410 --> 04:07.321
Oh.

04:07.370 --> 04:08.621
Hello.

04:10.460 --> 04:12.280
- Has anyone here ever met
a Chiropodist?

04:12.330 --> 04:13.809
Of course you haven't,
because they don't exist.

04:13.860 --> 04:16.283
But 100 years ago,
there was a whole department

04:16.340 --> 04:18.467
full of 'em cutting
people's toenails.

04:18.510 --> 04:20.649
But the field evolved
and Chiropody was

04:20.690 --> 04:22.032
absorbed into Podiatry.

04:22.080 --> 04:24.298
Chiropodists became obsolete.

04:24.350 --> 04:26.295
Why are we talking about
Chiropodists?

04:26.350 --> 04:27.476
- Because you're firing us?

04:27.520 --> 04:29.249
- No.

04:29.310 --> 04:31.653
We're talking about
Chiropodists not just because

04:31.700 --> 04:34.692
it's a really fun word to say,
but because I'm willing to bet

04:34.750 --> 04:36.354
that right here,
at New Amsterdam,

04:36.400 --> 04:37.389
there are people here
whose jobs

04:37.450 --> 04:39.395
are obsolete, bogus, wasted.

04:39.450 --> 04:41.406
Jobs that aren't really jobs
at all.

04:41.450 --> 04:43.577
But just because your job
is obsolete,

04:43.630 --> 04:45.530
doesn't mean you are.

04:45.580 --> 04:47.491
- Wait, are you firing us?
- No.

04:47.540 --> 04:50.282
I wanna find people whose
talents are being wasted

04:50.330 --> 04:51.581
and give them meaningful work.

04:51.630 --> 04:53.586
I wanna give them jobs
that matter.

04:53.640 --> 04:56.370
Every time a patient
walks out our doors,

04:56.420 --> 04:58.672
our people should feel like
they contributed to

04:58.730 --> 04:59.890
that patient's success.

04:59.950 --> 05:01.633
And no...

05:01.690 --> 05:03.419
I am not firing anybody.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.688
Every department is gonna
try this experiment,

05:05.740 --> 05:07.776
just for one day, stop working.

05:07.820 --> 05:10.903
Just sit there, stand there,
don't do anything.

05:10.960 --> 05:12.689
And if nobody misses
what you do

05:12.740 --> 05:15.391
or needs you to do something
for one whole day,

05:15.440 --> 05:17.351
then your job may be obsolete.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.482
Clearly not talking about
those people.

05:19.530 --> 05:23.614
But if it is you, come to me.
I wanna find you a new job.

05:23.670 --> 05:26.969
A job that inspires you,
a job that makes a difference,

05:27.020 --> 05:30.456
a job that makes you
an integral part of

05:30.500 --> 05:32.491
New Amsterdam's mission.

05:38.510 --> 05:40.466
- Dr. Panthaki?

05:40.510 --> 05:42.899
- Dr. Sharpe.

05:42.950 --> 05:44.463
- Fancy meeting you here.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.819
- Yeah, well, no.

05:46.860 --> 05:47.986
- No?

05:48.040 --> 05:49.644
- I came here to see a patient,

05:49.690 --> 05:51.078
and I thought I'd stop by
and say hi.

05:51.130 --> 05:52.904
I walked by your office,

05:52.960 --> 05:54.996
but they said you were on
the floor, so here I am,

05:55.050 --> 05:58.395
casually bumping into you,
accidentally on purpose.

05:58.440 --> 05:59.873
- I see.

05:59.920 --> 06:02.480
- I can also accidentally
on purpose leave.

06:02.530 --> 06:06.136
- No, I'm glad that you decided
to stop by...

06:07.410 --> 06:08.889
Accidentally on purpose.

06:09.890 --> 06:13.405
- And would you consider
joining me on an adventure?

06:13.460 --> 06:14.848
- An adventure?

06:14.890 --> 06:15.970
- It's a small adventure.

06:16.020 --> 06:17.544
Do you like Radiohead?

06:17.590 --> 06:18.841
- Yes.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.674
Love them.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.984
- Then we'll need to be on
a train from Penn Station

06:23.030 --> 06:24.372
in a few hours.

06:24.420 --> 06:26.376
- Why?
Where are we going?

06:26.420 --> 06:28.024
- Philadelphia.

06:28.080 --> 06:30.036
- So we'd be staying overnight?

06:31.730 --> 06:34.039
- We would be.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.638
- You know, yeah, no,

06:35.690 --> 06:38.864
I can't do that
right now...with you.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.603
- Okay.

06:40.660 --> 06:43.823
- I mean, I want to eventually,
I'm just...

06:43.880 --> 06:46.576
- Helen, I'll make you
a bootleg.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.492
- Well, I'm still not 100% sure
as to why Ms. Medrano

06:56.540 --> 06:58.144
collapsed on the ship.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.543
- Did her blood sugar spike
before or after the fall?

07:00.590 --> 07:01.932
- That's the million dollar
question.

07:01.980 --> 07:04.448
So, this must be some VIP
for you to drag me

07:04.510 --> 07:05.989
all the way up here.

07:06.030 --> 07:07.725
- It is.

07:07.770 --> 07:10.819
- So, who's the patient?

07:12.860 --> 07:14.077
- You are.

07:21.390 --> 07:23.176
- Yeah--hey, uh, Dora...

07:26.440 --> 07:28.351
- Hold on.

07:28.400 --> 07:32.131
Ijust wanna take in this
momentous occasion.

07:32.190 --> 07:33.225
- What occasion?

07:33.270 --> 07:34.794
- The day you chased after me.

07:34.840 --> 07:37.308
I wanna remember everything:
what I was wearing,

07:37.360 --> 07:38.497
where I was standing...

07:38.540 --> 07:39.973
- You haven't texted me.

07:40.020 --> 07:40.975
- Nope.
- Or paged me.

07:41.020 --> 07:42.453
- Did you miss me?

07:42.500 --> 07:44.058
- Well, I just figured by now
people would--

07:44.110 --> 07:45.281
- People would admit that
they were getting paid

07:45.330 --> 07:46.285
to not work?

07:46.330 --> 07:47.501
- That's not exactly--

07:47.550 --> 07:49.063
- And that they would ask you
for work,

07:49.120 --> 07:50.894
when they could just keep on
doing nothing?

07:50.940 --> 07:52.248
- That's not really in
the spirit of what I'm trying--

07:52.290 --> 07:54.338
- If it was me,
no way I'd tell you.

07:54.380 --> 07:55.938
- Max...

07:57.170 --> 07:59.468
What's going on with, um,
you know?

08:01.210 --> 08:02.472
- She's with Iggy.

08:06.480 --> 08:07.913
- I think I'm gonna be sick.

08:07.960 --> 08:10.178
- You did the right thing.

08:10.220 --> 08:11.391
- As a doctor, sure.

08:11.440 --> 08:13.522
But as a friend,
I absolutely did not.

08:13.580 --> 08:18.404
- You absolutely did,
as a doctor and as a friend.

08:28.370 --> 08:30.099
All right.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.889
Feel free to sit.

08:31.940 --> 08:33.498
- I'm fine.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.204
- Okay.

08:39.430 --> 08:40.909
All right.

08:40.950 --> 08:44.556
So, it says here you went to
Whitman College.

08:44.610 --> 08:46.510
- Yep.

08:46.560 --> 08:50.041
- All the way up in
Walla Walla, Washington, huh?

08:50.090 --> 08:51.569
Did you like it?

08:51.610 --> 08:53.566
- Loved it.

08:53.620 --> 08:56.134
- Why there?

08:56.180 --> 08:58.569
- Well, I guess it's because
I thought that they would

08:58.620 --> 09:01.350
prepare me for a career in
lifesaving medicine.

09:01.410 --> 09:03.401
One which I would love to
get back to right now,

09:03.450 --> 09:06.442
unless you're gonna tell me
what this all about.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.229
- Okay.

09:08.280 --> 09:11.454
Somebody reported that you have
a problem with Adderall.

09:13.070 --> 09:15.026
Sharpe.

09:15.070 --> 09:17.118
- I'm not at liberty to discuss
that with you.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.151
- Please.

09:19.210 --> 09:21.337
So, do you?

09:21.380 --> 09:22.984
- Do I what?

09:23.040 --> 09:24.598
- Do you have a problem
with Adderall?

09:24.650 --> 09:28.427
- No.
- Okay.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.038
Do you have any idea why
someone would suggest

09:30.090 --> 09:31.899
that you do?

09:31.960 --> 09:34.349
- Look, I spoke to Sharpe about
a personal matter,

09:34.390 --> 09:36.005
a minor personal matter,

09:36.050 --> 09:38.917
and she has blown it way out of
proportion.

09:38.960 --> 09:42.578
- Right, well, can you tell me
about the personal matter?

09:42.620 --> 09:44.224
- No.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.098
- Why not?

09:47.150 --> 09:48.663
- Because it's personal.

09:48.710 --> 09:51.144
And because quite frankly,
this whole ambush

09:51.190 --> 09:52.589
is unbelievably insulting,

09:52.630 --> 09:54.359
and I'm done pretending like
it isn't.

09:54.410 --> 09:55.968
- I wouldn't do that.

10:02.290 --> 10:04.281
I have been empowered by
the hospital to determine

10:04.340 --> 10:06.501
if you've been operating
as an impaired physician.

10:10.080 --> 10:11.388
- And if you have a problem
with Adderall,

10:11.430 --> 10:12.988
I will tell Max
and he'll report it

10:13.040 --> 10:15.213
to the medical board.

10:15.260 --> 10:19.173
- So, what, if I leave,
I'm suspended?

10:19.220 --> 10:22.439
- No, if you leave,
you're fired.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.228
- Dr. Reynolds.
- Dr. Goodwin.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.350
- I need a consult.
- What's the case?

10:31.410 --> 10:32.570
- Allison Medrano,
let's just call her

10:32.630 --> 10:33.972
a "non-compliant diabetic."

10:34.020 --> 10:35.533
- Hemoglobin A1C off the chart?

10:35.590 --> 10:37.069
- Yeah, and I wanna make sure
her collapse wasn't due to

10:37.110 --> 10:38.452
a silent heart attack.

10:38.500 --> 10:39.626
- Okay, I'll stop by after
the rounds.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.502
heard about _
your speech this mornIng.

10:42.550 --> 10:44.154
- You got someone for me
in your department?

10:44.200 --> 10:45.679
- No, everyone in
my department's on overdrive.

10:45.730 --> 10:47.152
But did you know there's a guy
in the basement

10:47.210 --> 10:49.166
who still prints X-rays?
-%mwm

10:49.210 --> 10:50.689
went digital a decade ago.

10:50.730 --> 10:53.290
- Well, that's why you should
check on him.

11:00.570 --> 11:01.525
Hello?

11:01.570 --> 11:03.470
- Need an X-ray?

11:03.530 --> 11:05.088
- Does that thing still work?

11:05.140 --> 11:07.700
- What, the XR-180?
Oh, yeah.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.218
And I like to keep it
nice and shiny, just in case.

11:11.490 --> 11:12.707
- When was the last time
someone ordered

11:12.750 --> 11:15.401
an old-fashioned X-ray
from you?

11:15.450 --> 11:19.409
- Uh, 2008...give or take.

11:19.460 --> 11:24.068
- So, you just been
down here since 2008?

11:25.720 --> 11:28.541
Doing what?

11:28.600 --> 11:31.410
- Am I about to get fired?
- Do you like your job?

11:34.380 --> 11:37.383
I loved it, actually.
Everybody needed me.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.250
Docs used to say nobody handled

11:39.300 --> 11:41.518
radiograph paper better than
I did.

11:41.570 --> 11:43.515
- I'm Max Goodwin,
I'm the Medical Director here.

11:43.570 --> 11:46.562
- Aw, nuts.
I am gonna get fired.

11:46.610 --> 11:49.693
- No, no, I'd liked to
find you a new job.

11:49.750 --> 11:53.265
A job that makes you feel
needed again.

11:53.320 --> 11:54.742
Would you be interested?

11:54.800 --> 11:57.610
- It's like you can see
right through me.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.620
It's an X-ray joke.
- X-ray joke.

12:01.670 --> 12:03.809
It's great.
So what do you say?

12:03.850 --> 12:06.842
- You know, with technology
being what it is

12:06.900 --> 12:09.198
and me being as old as I am,

12:09.250 --> 12:13.596
I think I'm just gonna
ride it out until retirement.

12:13.640 --> 12:14.766
I mean,

12:14.820 --> 12:16.424
if you're not firing me.

12:19.340 --> 12:21.729
- Rohan.

12:21.780 --> 12:23.293
- Pappa.

12:23.350 --> 12:24.647
- You came all the way
down here

12:24.700 --> 12:26.770
and won't say nothing to
your father?

12:26.830 --> 12:28.434
- I didn't wanna bother you.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.823
- Bother?
No, no.

12:30.880 --> 12:34.259
I wanna apologize to you, beta.

12:34.310 --> 12:36.266
- For what?

12:36.320 --> 12:39.130
- I know I've hurt
your feelings before,

12:39.190 --> 12:42.535
when I refused to support
your music.

12:42.580 --> 12:44.536
I should have been
more supportive of you.

12:46.940 --> 12:51.104
That doesn't mean that you use
Ella to get back at me.

12:51.160 --> 12:52.457
- What?

12:52.510 --> 12:53.807
- Yeah, she doesn't need to be
dragged into

12:53.860 --> 12:55.157
our family business.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.462
- Is that what you think
is going on?

12:56.510 --> 12:57.499
That I'm using her?

12:57.550 --> 12:59.506
- I am trying to protect her.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.289
- Excuse me.

13:01.340 --> 13:03.467
I'm hanging out with Ella
because I actually like her,

13:03.520 --> 13:05.249
not that it's any of
your business.

13:05.300 --> 13:06.688
- I think you are
misunderstanding me.

13:06.740 --> 13:08.696
- No, I'm understanding you
just fine.

13:08.740 --> 13:13.348
And I know it's hard for you
to comprehend, Pappa,

13:13.400 --> 13:15.868
but the reason I could stay
sober for a year

13:15.920 --> 13:19.481
was that I didn't have to deal
with this.

13:19.530 --> 13:21.839
I...

13:21.880 --> 13:23.484
I didn't have to deal with you.

13:36.250 --> 13:39.629
- Jessica, you should move back
to Sheepshead Bay.

13:39.680 --> 13:42.638
- Mom, I'd love to,
but my job is here.

13:42.690 --> 13:44.942
You know, most parents would be
proud their kid's a doctor.

13:44.990 --> 13:48.517
- Well, there's something
to be said about tradition.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.551
Our family has a tradition...

13:50.610 --> 13:53.511
- Of diabetes, heart disease,
and lung cancer.

13:54.740 --> 13:56.696
- People gotta die of
something.

13:56.740 --> 13:59.914
- Allison Medrano,
I need you to get back inside.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.359
- Who the hell are you?

14:01.400 --> 14:03.652
- Your doctor.
- Since when?

14:03.710 --> 14:07.532
- Well, since you had to be
evaluated for heart disease.

14:07.580 --> 14:08.888
Dr. Medrano.
- Dr. Reynolds,

14:08.930 --> 14:10.750
thank you for
taking care of my mom.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.529
- I don't need
taking care of.

14:12.590 --> 14:13.932
- We're gonna do a full
work-up,

14:13.980 --> 14:16.414
but I need you to get back
inside ﬁrst, all right?

14:16.460 --> 14:18.769
- Yeah, yeah.

14:18.810 --> 14:19.890
- Mom.
- Jeez--

14:22.940 --> 14:23.895
- Mom!

14:23.950 --> 14:25.554
- Hold on. Hold on.

14:25.600 --> 14:26.817
I need a stretcher out here!

14:26.860 --> 14:28.248
Okay.

14:36.440 --> 14:39.568
You get what's ironic
about this.

14:39.610 --> 14:41.874
- No.
Help me out.

14:41.920 --> 14:44.650
- I have a prescription
for Adderall.

14:44.700 --> 14:45.962
I mean, the risk would be

14:46.010 --> 14:48.615
_ in me not _
taking my medication.

14:48.670 --> 14:51.537
You know, I'd be, like,
mid-appendectomy

14:51.580 --> 14:53.309
getting distracted by
how the appendix

14:53.370 --> 14:55.668
looks like a giant shrimp.

14:55.720 --> 14:58.530
- So, you find it ironic
that you've been placed

14:58.590 --> 15:00.842
in jeopardy by a tool that
helps you succeed?

15:00.900 --> 15:02.549
- No.
No, I find it ironic

15:02.590 --> 15:04.023
that I'm being persecuted by

15:04.070 --> 15:06.243
a psychiatrist for taking
a medication

15:06.290 --> 15:07.803
prescribed by a psychiatrist.

15:11.510 --> 15:13.774
That was harsh; I know
you're not persecuting me.

15:13.820 --> 15:15.424
- It's okay.
It's fine.

15:15.470 --> 15:17.734
- It's just...

15:17.780 --> 15:19.771
I've got ADHD.

15:19.830 --> 15:23.300
I've taken Adderall,
as prescribed, since I was 12.

15:23.350 --> 15:24.874
It's a non-issue.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.694
- Yeah.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.832
And you've never taken more
than your prescribed dose?

15:30.790 --> 15:33.873
- I'm sure I have doubled up
by accident, okay?

15:33.930 --> 15:37.889
Double shifts, the days,
they can just run in together.

15:39.410 --> 15:41.537
- But you've never taken it
just to, you know,

15:41.590 --> 15:42.545
just to get through the day?

15:42.590 --> 15:43.545
- No.

15:43.590 --> 15:45.490
Hard no.

15:46.770 --> 15:48.761
- You sure about that?

15:48.810 --> 15:51.506
- You can't run an ED
propped up on pills, okay?

15:51.550 --> 15:53.984
It's unethical
and I wouldn't do it.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.907
- So, your drug use has never
led to the harm of a patient?

15:56.950 --> 15:58.906
- Oh, you know what?
I've killed thousands.

15:58.950 --> 16:01.510
Ijust--I get high and I start
stabbing people

16:01.560 --> 16:03.300
with my scalpel.

16:03.350 --> 16:04.647
- This isn't personal, Bloom.

16:04.700 --> 16:05.780
I'm not trying to insult you.

16:05.830 --> 16:07.604
- You're asking me if I've ever

16:07.660 --> 16:09.742
risked a patient's life
because I'm stoned.

16:09.790 --> 16:11.781
- Yeah, and you haven't
answered the question.

16:11.840 --> 16:15.003
- Because if I had,
we wouldn't be here right now.

16:15.060 --> 16:17.528
I would have turned in
my license, okay?

16:20.840 --> 16:24.492
- No, I have never harmed
a patient because of Adderall.

16:35.510 --> 16:37.068
Do you remember
LaDavius Powell?

16:40.080 --> 16:42.992
LaDavius Powell?
That ring a bell?

16:43.040 --> 16:44.689
It's a patient of yours
that came in,

16:48.570 --> 16:49.912
If your nurse hadn't have
caught the mistake...

16:49.960 --> 16:52.918
- No, that's not
the whole story, so...

16:52.960 --> 16:54.564
- No?

17:03.890 --> 17:05.107
Earlier you assumed

17:05.150 --> 17:06.845
that it was one single doctor

17:06.890 --> 17:07.879
that voiced concern.

17:07.930 --> 17:09.488
That's not the case.

17:11.940 --> 17:15.671
Multiple people have complained
that you're having problems.

17:15.730 --> 17:18.631
You're making mistakes on
your patient reports.

17:18.680 --> 17:22.593
Your reaction time has slipped.
Your behavior has been erratic.

17:22.650 --> 17:25.517
And this mistake you made
with LaDavius Powell could have

17:25.560 --> 17:27.733
very easily cost him his life.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.174
And now you've sat there
and looked me in the eyes,

17:33.220 --> 17:35.438
and you've lied to me about it.

17:38.010 --> 17:40.524
What part of the story
am I missing?

17:40.580 --> 17:42.002
What have I got wrong?

17:46.500 --> 17:49.446
You said, in your own words,

17:49.500 --> 17:52.060
if your drug use ever led to
the harm of a patient,

17:52.110 --> 17:54.192
you would turn in
your license.

17:55.980 --> 17:58.119
So what are you waiting for?

18:07.390 --> 18:09.551
- Dr. Hayek to pediatrics.

18:09.610 --> 18:11.259
Dr. Hayek to pediatrics.

18:11.300 --> 18:13.518
- It's okay.
I've got this.

18:13.570 --> 18:15.128
Right.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.178
- Oh, boy, she was smoking,

18:19.220 --> 18:21.609
collapsed with a blood sugar
of over 700.

18:21.660 --> 18:23.833
It took 100 units of insulin
to bring her back.

18:23.880 --> 18:25.268
- So, it's the high
blood sugar.

18:25.320 --> 18:27.185
- Well, we still don't know
why it keeps spiking.

18:28.670 --> 18:30.319
- What if it's the smoking?

18:31.930 --> 18:33.978
- Yeah, smoking's bad for you.

18:34.020 --> 18:35.237
- Wha_t if_she has
a carcm0id tumor

18:35.280 --> 18:37.066
that's being stimulated
by nicotine?

18:37.110 --> 18:39.158
Just now when she collapsed,
she was smoking.

18:39.200 --> 18:42.328
On the boat when she collapsed,
she was smoking.

18:42.380 --> 18:44.063
What if the nicotine from
the cigarettes is

18:44.120 --> 18:45.508
squeezing the tumor,
making it kick out

18:45.550 --> 18:46.596
huge amounts of glucagon,

18:46.640 --> 18:48.119
and that is what is driving

18:48.170 --> 18:49.501
the blood sugar through
the roof?

18:49.560 --> 18:51.642
- Well, I did a CT on
Al's abdomen and her chest

18:51.690 --> 18:53.169
and no tumor.

18:53.210 --> 18:54.347
- But all of her symptoms
point to it.

18:54.390 --> 18:56.119
- Except it's not there.

18:56.170 --> 18:59.048
- So do exploratory surgery
and find it.

19:00.220 --> 19:02.176
- Who does exploratory surgery
anymore?

19:02.220 --> 19:04.916
- We do when we know
something's wrong.

19:08.010 --> 19:09.523
Mr. Harris...

19:09.580 --> 19:12.014
Uh, you're from
the Med Co-Op Group, right?

19:12.060 --> 19:14.528
- Actually, I'm just...uh,

19:14.580 --> 19:16.138
I've been here for nine years.

19:16.190 --> 19:17.532
- I kept you waiting that long?

19:17.590 --> 19:21.321
- No.
I heard your speech today.

19:21.370 --> 19:24.328
I think I've got one of those
obsolete jobs.

19:26.940 --> 19:29.204
- So, uh, what's your job?

19:29.250 --> 19:30.501
- To sit there.
- Ah.

19:30.560 --> 19:31.982
- Before the arm showed up,

19:32.040 --> 19:33.553
I sat in a booth
and checked badges.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.420
I was the guy you said
good morning to,

19:35.470 --> 19:37.472
asked about the traffic
down from Westchester.

19:37.520 --> 19:40.034
- Always packed on the FDR,
no matter what time of day.

19:40.090 --> 19:43.253
- But go down 2nd Ave before
7:00 a.m., not so bad.

19:43.310 --> 19:44.698
- Good to know.

19:44.740 --> 19:47.265
- But since the arm,
people don't even notice me.

19:47.310 --> 19:49.915
And I wanna do _more than
just Sit in a chair all day.

19:49.970 --> 19:51.392
I know I can do more.

19:51.450 --> 19:54.180
- See, you're exactly who
I'm looking for.

19:54.230 --> 19:55.538
- Uh--Oh, Dr. Goodwin--

19:55.580 --> 19:58.094
- No, you are the reason
I started this search.

19:58.150 --> 19:59.367
- Dr. Goodwin.
- Yeah?

19:59.410 --> 20:01.014
- You're in her way.
- Oh, sorry.

20:01.060 --> 20:02.322
- So what's my new job
gonna be?

20:02.370 --> 20:04.497
- I have no idea.

20:17.210 --> 20:19.519
- So now what?

20:19.560 --> 20:22.085
- Well, now I'd like to hear
about your life before

20:22.130 --> 20:23.688
your Adderall use began.

20:26.520 --> 20:30.263
- Are you seriously asking me
to talk about my childhood?

20:30.310 --> 20:33.655
- Or I could just file
my report right now.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.480
- Fine.

20:44.500 --> 20:47.628
Well, my mom was a disaster,
my sister, worse,

20:47.680 --> 20:49.489
and my dad was a saint.

20:49.550 --> 20:52.018
There ya go.

20:52.070 --> 20:53.628
- There you go.

20:55.510 --> 20:59.423
Okay, well, how was your mom
a disaster?

21:05.130 --> 21:06.552
- She was an alcoholic.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.565
- I'm sorry.

21:10.610 --> 21:12.305
- Yeah, well,

21:12.350 --> 21:13.783
boo-hoo, right?

21:17.050 --> 21:19.484
She was, uh...

21:19.530 --> 21:22.488
She was a part of this--
this tacky

21:22.540 --> 21:26.180
nouveau riche
Upper East Side crowd.

21:26.240 --> 21:28.140
Everybody knew she drank.

21:28.190 --> 21:32.718
But it didn't matter,
'cause Jeanie was so fun.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.322
Her parties were fabulous.

21:36.380 --> 21:39.110
- Yeah, but then
the party ended, right?

21:39.160 --> 21:41.503
- Yeah.

21:41.560 --> 21:43.425
That it did.

21:46.260 --> 21:49.730
Then she'd start complaining...

21:49.780 --> 21:54.604
About how Mr. Benson
wouldn't flirt with her,

21:54.660 --> 21:58.266
or the Dover sole was dry,
always something.

22:01.180 --> 22:03.444
And she'd get mean.

22:03.490 --> 22:06.277
- Was there physical abuse?
- No.

22:11.410 --> 22:13.401
- Would she get sick
after she drank?

22:16.420 --> 22:18.376
Yeah?

22:18.420 --> 22:20.320
Who'd take her to bed?
Who'd clean up?

22:21.860 --> 22:24.283
- That'd be me.

22:24.340 --> 22:26.558
- What about your sister,
she help?

22:26.600 --> 22:28.682
- I didn't need help.

22:28.730 --> 22:31.642
Someone had to clean her up,
so I cleaned her up.

22:33.130 --> 22:36.213
- How old were you
the first time that happened?

22:36.260 --> 22:38.251
- I don't know.

22:38.310 --> 22:39.607
- Ballpark.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.482
- Seven, maybe.
- Wow.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.313
You've been taking care of
people long before

22:49.360 --> 22:51.146
you became an ED doctor, huh?

22:52.670 --> 22:54.661
- Yeah.

22:54.720 --> 22:58.190
Well, that's the silver lining
of having

22:58.240 --> 23:00.231
Hurricane Jeanie for a mom.

23:01.770 --> 23:04.807
You learn how to be good
in a crisis.

23:04.860 --> 23:06.464
- Yeah, I bet.

23:12.470 --> 23:15.382
Sounds like your dad left you
in quite a tricky situation.

23:17.650 --> 23:18.776
- I didn't say that.

23:18.830 --> 23:20.479
- No?

23:20.520 --> 23:22.431
You didn't say much about him
at all.

23:22.480 --> 23:25.699
- My dad...my dad took

23:25.750 --> 23:29.265
a two-bit dermatology practice
and he turned it into

23:29.320 --> 23:32.312
a million dollar business.

23:32.360 --> 23:33.702
- That's amazing.

23:33.760 --> 23:36.627
- Yeah, he was gone a lot,

23:36.670 --> 23:40.367
but when I called,
he always answered.

23:40.410 --> 23:42.287
Every time.

23:42.330 --> 23:46.323
So, uh, you can dial back
the Freudian horse-crap, okay?

23:46.380 --> 23:48.245
- There's nothing Freudian
about saying

23:48.290 --> 23:50.463
that he neglected you.

23:50.510 --> 23:52.330
- He was amazing dad.

23:54.250 --> 23:56.810
He wasn't the alcoholic.

23:56.870 --> 23:59.737
_He wasn't the one
pissmg on the carpet.

23:59.780 --> 24:01.828
He wasn't the one
vomiting on himself.

24:01.870 --> 24:04.782
- No, he was the one who left
a second-grader alone

24:04.830 --> 24:06.912
to deal with it.

24:06.960 --> 24:09.349
Because he knew what you
already told me:

24:09.400 --> 24:11.391
someone always
has to clean it up.

24:13.930 --> 24:16.490
You just described him as
an emotionally-closed off

24:16.540 --> 24:19.316
workaholic who was in
complete denial that

24:19.370 --> 24:21.452
his personal life was on fire.

24:23.850 --> 24:25.670
Who does that sound like?

24:36.990 --> 24:39.333
- Dr. Goodwin.
- Yeah?

24:39.390 --> 24:40.869
- I've been emailing the powers
that be at New Amsterdam

24:40.910 --> 24:42.161
about my useless job for years.

24:42.210 --> 24:43.689
And nothing, no response.

24:43.740 --> 24:45.162
I don't even feel bad about
taking a paycheck

24:45.220 --> 24:46.915
for doing nothing anymore,
but you should know that

24:46.960 --> 24:48.382
because I tried
to contact someone,

24:48.440 --> 24:50.169
New Amsterdam legally
can't take that money back.

24:50.220 --> 24:51.949
- I wouldn't even try,
but what's your obsolete job?

24:52.010 --> 24:53.352
- Tech.
- Cool.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.049
- In the accounting department.
- Ah.

24:55.100 --> 24:56.829
- Whenever FlashPay has any
kind of software update,

24:56.880 --> 24:58.097
it's my job to install it on
every single computer

24:58.140 --> 24:59.402
throughout the whole hospital.

24:59.450 --> 25:00.405
- That sounds like
a very important job.

25:00.450 --> 25:01.838
- It was five years ago,

25:01.890 --> 25:03.278
when New Amsterdam still used
FlashPay.

25:03.320 --> 25:05.185
Now only one person in
the whole hospital uses it.

25:05.240 --> 25:06.537
- Who's that?

25:06.590 --> 25:07.932
- Me, when I update it on
all the computers.

25:07.980 --> 25:09.231
- I'll find you a new job.
- Great.

25:09.290 --> 25:12.100
So, what'll that be?
- No idea.

25:14.120 --> 25:16.987
- Systolic 140; pulse ox 97.

25:18.120 --> 25:19.815
- Popcorn on a stick.
- Lap sponge.

25:22.860 --> 25:24.908
- Wet wrap the whole tip.

25:24.950 --> 25:26.474
- You see anything?

25:28.090 --> 25:29.387
- Nothing.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.169
- We visualized the entire
abdomen.

25:31.220 --> 25:32.437
- Yeah.

25:32.480 --> 25:33.435
- I can't believe we let
Dr. Goodwin

25:33.480 --> 25:35.084
talk us into this.

25:35.140 --> 25:37.870
- He thought a carcinoid tumor
fit all her symptoms.

25:37.920 --> 25:40.445
- Well, he was wrong.

25:40.490 --> 25:43.277
- Fresh ESU pencil
on the tray.

25:43.320 --> 25:46.050
- I'm gonna run the bowel.

25:46.100 --> 25:49.228
- All 23 feet of it?
- Yep.

25:50.460 --> 25:52.360
then you're crazier than he is.

26:00.470 --> 26:03.849
- Hey, man of the hour.
_ 1--

26:03.910 --> 26:05.298
- Your son is the sweetest,

26:05.340 --> 26:06.511
We have been having
the best time.

26:06.560 --> 26:09.199
We're gonna go to Battery Park
tonight.

26:09.260 --> 26:11.478
- Yes...

26:11.520 --> 26:13.215
About Rohan...

26:15.050 --> 26:18.304
It appears I may have hurt
my son's feelings this morning.

26:18.350 --> 26:20.306
- Oh.

26:20.360 --> 26:24.091
- Unintentionally, of course,
but I wanted to clear things up

26:24.140 --> 26:25.539
before you heard his side
of the story.

26:25.580 --> 26:27.354
- There are sides?

26:29.020 --> 26:33.275
- Not exactly, it's just I was
looking out for you, you see?

26:33.330 --> 26:37.152
Uh trying to...protect you.

26:37.200 --> 26:39.418
- Why would I need protecting?

26:42.470 --> 26:45.200
- I was concerned that my son
had taken an interest in you

26:45.250 --> 26:49.812
simply to...to hurt me.

26:49.860 --> 26:51.339
- Why would you think that?

26:55.650 --> 26:58.915
- Because of a disagreement
we had.

26:58.960 --> 27:01.918
- Or because you don't think
your son could be interested in

27:01.960 --> 27:03.222
someone like me?

27:03.270 --> 27:04.999
- Oh, well, no, I--I just--

27:05.050 --> 27:06.915
- Because you actually thought
the only reason Rohan

27:06.970 --> 27:08.392
would ever be interested in me

27:08.450 --> 27:10.099
is if he was using me
to get back at you?

27:10.150 --> 27:12.050
- No, that's not what I meant.

27:12.100 --> 27:14.182
- Well, you must have meant it
on some level

27:14.240 --> 27:16.014
or you wouldn't have said it.

27:16.060 --> 27:17.322
- I fear there has been

27:17.370 --> 27:18.849
a profound misunderstanding
here--

27:18.890 --> 27:22.508
- No, I thinkI heard you
loud and clear.

27:22.550 --> 27:24.677
Hi, welcome to Pain de Vie.
Excuse me.

27:24.730 --> 27:27.597
- Hi, um, I'll get
a small latte.

27:27.640 --> 27:30.859
- Sure, is whole milk okay?
- Yeah.

27:30.910 --> 27:33.640
And can I get two muffins?

27:40.090 --> 27:43.264
- You know this is why no one
likes therapists.

27:43.310 --> 27:45.699
You're taking my life
and you're...

27:45.750 --> 27:47.559
You're twisting it around.

27:47.620 --> 27:50.612
- Okay, well, then help me out.
Tell me a different story.

27:50.660 --> 27:52.309
Help me understand.

27:52.360 --> 27:54.225
- All right, how 'bout this?

27:54.280 --> 27:58.057
Dad saved_ himself from
an imp055ible Situation.

27:58.110 --> 28:00.328
No, he was not perfect,

28:00.370 --> 28:03.624
but I never doubted that
he loved me.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.193
So you can come at me all day,

28:05.240 --> 28:07.936
but I'm not blaming him
for my mistakes.

28:07.990 --> 28:09.673
- I'm not blaming him for
your mistakes, either.

28:09.730 --> 28:12.290
- He did the best he could
for as long as he could.

28:12.340 --> 28:13.728
- Did you hear me?

28:13.770 --> 28:15.556
I'm not blaming him for
your mistakes.

28:15.600 --> 28:17.079
- Okay, so why the hell are we
still talking about this?

28:17.130 --> 28:18.461
- Because you went to
Whitman College

28:18.520 --> 28:20.215
in Walla Walla, Washington.

28:20.260 --> 28:21.739
You literally could have gone
anywhere else,

28:21.780 --> 28:24.647
but you went all the way
across the country.

28:24.700 --> 28:27.430
Family psychological histories
are a lot like genetic ones,

28:27.480 --> 28:29.391
and you have the gene for
running.

28:29.440 --> 28:32.398
So I'm asking you...

28:32.440 --> 28:34.089
What are you running from?

28:44.150 --> 28:47.938
You're right.
I'm like my dad.

28:47.980 --> 28:50.631
We both ran.

28:50.680 --> 28:54.332
And yeah, he was running
from my mom.

28:54.380 --> 28:58.589
But I am not running from,
I am running to.

29:00.820 --> 29:03.516
I'm an ED doctor.

29:03.560 --> 29:05.289
I run to crisis.

29:05.350 --> 29:08.171
I mean, I run to help people.

29:08.220 --> 29:09.608
And yeah, you know what?

29:09.660 --> 29:11.605
My childhood, it sucked.

29:11.660 --> 29:13.480
But it made me who I am.

29:13.530 --> 29:17.352
And this hospital
is luclq to have me.

29:25.850 --> 29:28.273
- Okay.

29:28.330 --> 29:30.548
Thank you for that.

29:36.550 --> 29:38.723
Do you think you can get
your Adderall under control?

29:40.340 --> 29:41.773
- Yes.

29:41.820 --> 29:43.549
- And do you think that
practicing medicine

29:43.600 --> 29:45.386
is the best thing for
your recovery?

29:47.300 --> 29:49.689
- I know it is.

29:57.090 --> 29:59.832
- Okay then.

29:59.880 --> 30:01.188
Get back out there.

30:04.150 --> 30:06.448
You're clear.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.058
Go show 'em how it's done.

30:39.440 --> 30:40.657
Lauren?

30:45.880 --> 30:47.279
Lauren.

30:50.190 --> 30:52.181
I didn't know what else to do.

30:57.420 --> 30:58.455
- No problem.

30:58.500 --> 31:00.149
I was cleared.

31:07.900 --> 31:11.688
- Clevidipine infusion rate:
1 milligram per hour.

31:11.730 --> 31:14.210
Balfour retractor standing by.

31:14.260 --> 31:16.694
- She is so stubborn.

31:16.740 --> 31:17.900
- Show me a kid
who doesn't think

31:17.960 --> 31:19.860
their parents are stubborn.

31:19.920 --> 31:22.218
- She's overweight, diabetic,
and spends most of her time

31:22.270 --> 31:24.738
chain-smoking, eating
fried foods, and drinking.

31:24.790 --> 31:27.520
And she has no intention
of ever changing.

31:27.580 --> 31:29.707
- That's problematic.

31:29.750 --> 31:33.402
- That's a recipe
for disaster.

31:33.450 --> 31:36.408
I'm the only one
telling her to stop.

31:36.450 --> 31:38.930
The rest of her buddies
out in Sheepshead Bay,

31:38.980 --> 31:41.585
they all have
the same bad habits.

31:41.630 --> 31:43.359
- Maybe they all need
a little attention.

31:43.420 --> 31:45.320
- They need a swift
kick in the pants.

31:48.550 --> 31:51.940
- You know, I got out there
often as I can,

31:51.990 --> 31:52.979
prescribe them what they need,

31:53.040 --> 31:55.292
but it's just...

31:55.340 --> 31:58.685
It's not enough.

31:58.740 --> 32:00.640
- Found it.

32:01.870 --> 32:05.306
- Yeah, I can feel an abnormal
nodule right here.

32:05.350 --> 32:07.818
I'm gonna cut it out,
send it to pathology.

32:08.830 --> 32:12.709
- Is it crazy I'm happy
Dr. Reynolds found a tumor

32:12.750 --> 32:13.830
in my mom's bowel?

32:13.880 --> 32:16.440
- No, you're not crazy.

32:16.490 --> 32:19.573
Come with me,
you gave me an idea.

32:25.980 --> 32:28.448
Thank you all for coming.
- He is canning us.

32:28.510 --> 32:29.932
-Hmm?

32:29.990 --> 32:31.503
- It's just like that scene
in "Goodfellas"

32:31.550 --> 32:32.812
when they tell Joe Pesci
he's gonna get made

32:32.860 --> 32:34.373
and he's all excited
and dressed up,

32:34.430 --> 32:35.727
and then he goes in the room,
and whack!

32:35.770 --> 32:37.943
They whack him.
- I am not whacking you.

32:37.990 --> 32:40.732
I'm hiring you, all of you.

32:40.780 --> 32:42.828
We're opening a new clinic
in Sheepshead Bay.

32:42.870 --> 32:44.997
And since you're all
on payroll already,

32:45.050 --> 32:47.689
this will actually be the first
profitable thing I've done.

32:47.740 --> 32:49.002
- Sheepshead Bay?

32:49.050 --> 32:50.745
- New Amsterdam runs
satellite clinics

32:50.790 --> 32:52.485
all over the city,
but we've neglected this part

32:52.530 --> 32:53.838
of Brooklyn and the people
who live there,

32:53.880 --> 32:56.667
and that ends today
with your help.

32:56.710 --> 32:58.871
- Sounds great,
but I'm kinda over

32:58.930 --> 33:01.012
the parking attendant thing.

33:01.060 --> 33:03.665
- Good, because you'll be
running our reception area.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.881
Greeting people,
making sure they feel at ease.

33:05.940 --> 33:07.669
- That I can do.

33:07.720 --> 33:10.416
- Anna, you'll be installing
our new computer systems.

33:10.460 --> 33:12.542
- Linux or DOS?
- No idea.

33:12.590 --> 33:15.024
And Jessica, you'll be
caring for the community

33:15.080 --> 33:17.025
who raised you
and who needs you now.

33:17.080 --> 33:19.378
- Thank you, Max.

33:19.430 --> 33:21.819
- Hello?
I hope I'm not too late.

33:21.860 --> 33:25.387
- Everyone, meet our new
radiology department.

33:41.140 --> 33:42.357
- You're gonna need
the suture kit.

33:42.410 --> 33:44.708
- Yeah.

34:41.990 --> 34:43.639
- Ask me again.

34:48.170 --> 34:50.866
- What are you running from?

35:03.230 --> 35:06.961
I told my mom that
I was going to NYU.

35:07.010 --> 35:10.013
That I'd be here in town,
close by.

35:12.240 --> 35:15.880
Dad had died the year before,
and things had gotten...

35:17.720 --> 35:20.234
I didn't even tell her that
I applied to Whitman.

35:22.030 --> 35:24.112
I didn't tell Vanessa,
my sister.

35:27.600 --> 35:30.945
And I knew...

35:30.990 --> 35:35.689
I knew that they wouldn't be
okay without me.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.174
I mean, I protected Vanessa.

35:40.220 --> 35:43.872
She thought I was a rock star.

35:43.920 --> 35:47.174
But she was 12...

35:47.230 --> 35:50.927
I mean, I couldn't--I couldn't
take her with me.

35:52.710 --> 35:55.178
I wanted to,

35:55.240 --> 35:57.231
but I knew ifI didn't go...

35:58.980 --> 36:00.880
Then I was never gonna get out.

36:06.250 --> 36:10.687
One night, I...
Itucked her up in bed...

36:14.820 --> 36:16.299
And I left.

36:16.340 --> 36:19.514
I, um...

36:19.560 --> 36:21.949
I left my little sister.

36:25.570 --> 36:29.529
She's in rehab now, again.

36:29.570 --> 36:30.787
Fourth time.

36:30.840 --> 36:32.705
- That is not on you.

36:34.270 --> 36:36.090
- I could have saved her,
you know?

36:36.150 --> 36:37.833
I mean, I could have saved
my mom.

36:37.890 --> 36:39.278
- You were a kid,
that is not your job.

36:39.320 --> 36:41.231
- Then whose was it?

36:41.280 --> 36:44.750
I mean, I was all they had,
and then I just--I just left.

36:46.110 --> 36:48.578
- Listen to me.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.722
There are people
all over the world

36:50.770 --> 36:52.897
with families just like yours.

36:52.940 --> 36:54.988
All over the world.

36:55.030 --> 36:58.682
And many of them,
most of them,

36:58.730 --> 37:00.595
they never get out.

37:03.130 --> 37:05.303
You saved the only person
that you could save.

37:05.350 --> 37:07.079
You did not fail.

37:07.130 --> 37:09.655
What you did was an act of
incredible strength.

37:13.400 --> 37:15.618
- I don't feel strong.

37:19.140 --> 37:21.927
- You only have to be strong
enough to do one more thing.

37:29.370 --> 37:32.066
I need help.

37:32.110 --> 37:33.987
- Okay.

37:35.770 --> 37:37.818
We can do that.

37:37.860 --> 37:39.293
Okay?

37:43.340 --> 37:44.989
- Were you, uh,

37:45.040 --> 37:47.167
were you really clearing me
to go back to work?

37:48.390 --> 37:50.858
- And let a drug addict loose
in the ED?

37:52.000 --> 37:53.262
God, no.

37:53.310 --> 37:56.302
- You kidding me?

37:59.010 --> 38:01.615
- Throw away your things

38:01.670 --> 38:05.788
When this is over

38:09.850 --> 38:12.978
Oh, when the ice

38:13.020 --> 38:15.159
Is melted away

38:17.380 --> 38:21.157
And the hunger returns

38:21.210 --> 38:23.986
I will be the same

38:24.040 --> 38:26.031
- Hey.

38:26.080 --> 38:28.207
- Hey.

38:29.740 --> 38:32.345
- I wasn't expecting
to see you.

38:32.390 --> 38:34.176
- Because I cut you off
at the knees?

38:34.220 --> 38:38.008
- I came on too strong.
It's a personality defect.

38:38.050 --> 38:41.042
- No, you didn't, and it's not.

38:41.100 --> 38:44.831
It was spontaneous and fun

38:44.880 --> 38:47.189
and completely lovely.

38:49.020 --> 38:52.888
And that's what made it
utterly terrifying for me.

38:57.810 --> 39:00.119
I haven't wanted to _take
a chance on something--

39:00.160 --> 39:04.073
um, on someone
in a really long time.

39:04.120 --> 39:07.772
I mean, I used to be
a person who took chances,

39:07.820 --> 39:09.299
and I really wanna be
that person again.

39:09.340 --> 39:10.864
- You don't have to explain.

39:10.910 --> 39:12.161
- No, I want to.

39:12.210 --> 39:14.212
You make me want to.

39:16.130 --> 39:19.861
I--I have baggage.

39:21.270 --> 39:25.229
And it comes with me
wherever I go.

39:25.270 --> 39:28.922
And to be honest,
I'm so tired of

39:28.970 --> 39:31.928
dragging it around with me.

39:33.450 --> 39:36.055
- Is that an overnight bag?

39:36.110 --> 39:38.066
- Yes.

39:38.110 --> 39:40.897
I have literally brought
my baggage with me.

39:43.200 --> 39:44.451
But only 'cause there's

39:44.510 --> 39:46.330
a Radiohead concert
in Philadelphia.

39:47.950 --> 39:50.418
Any interest in going with me?

39:50.470 --> 39:53.075
- I took it for love

39:53.120 --> 39:56.248
Or at least something
beautiful

39:59.830 --> 40:02.082
- Of all the windows
in all the hallways

40:02.130 --> 40:04.086
in this hospital,

40:04.140 --> 40:05.914
you had to stand
in front of mine.

40:05.960 --> 40:08.485
Get your own window.

40:08.530 --> 40:11.055
- I needed your advice today,
my friend,

40:11.100 --> 40:14.274
but you were busy.

40:14.320 --> 40:16.402
- Yeah, I mean,
that happens sometimes.

40:17.980 --> 40:21.939
- As a result,
I managed to lose

40:21.980 --> 40:24.494
my only friend

40:24.550 --> 40:26.450
and my only son.

40:27.990 --> 40:29.241
- I'm sure it's not that bad.

40:30.990 --> 40:33.151
- It is that bad.

40:33.210 --> 40:35.519
- Oh.

40:35.560 --> 40:37.460
Okay, sorry.

40:41.430 --> 40:42.988
- So what do I do now?

40:47.050 --> 40:50.008
Iggy, I need you to help me.

40:52.050 --> 40:54.439
- Okay.

40:58.840 --> 41:01.149
- Where have you been

41:01.190 --> 41:04.455
And what have you done

41:07.550 --> 41:08.972
- How's the VIP?

41:10.590 --> 41:13.024
Not feeling
very important.

41:14.380 --> 41:15.984
- Well, you are,

41:16.030 --> 41:19.113
to me,
to everyone.

41:22.130 --> 41:26.908
It's gonna be hard,
but...when you make it...

41:28.310 --> 41:29.959
Your job's gonna be right here
waiting for you.

41:32.220 --> 41:34.962
- My job means everything
to me, Max.

41:37.400 --> 41:39.618
- I know the feeling.

41:42.970 --> 41:47.623
- Moving pictures

41:47.670 --> 41:52.198
In silent films
