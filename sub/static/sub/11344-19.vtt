(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:07.708 --> 00:11.079
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:11.112 --> 00:13.814
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:13.847 --> 00:15.449
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:15.483 --> 00:17.118
are members
of an elite squad

00:17.151 --> 00:18.819
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.289
These are their stories.

00:23.191 --> 00:25.493
(Tommy)
Patty?

00:25.526 --> 00:26.527
Patty?

00:29.497 --> 00:32.066
So, I'm gonna go.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.136
Yep.

00:35.803 --> 00:38.739
I'm sorry, Patty,
we just--

00:38.772 --> 00:41.409
We bring out the worst
in each other.

00:41.442 --> 00:44.378
Thanks, Dr. Phil.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.680
I love you.

00:46.714 --> 00:49.850
But sometimes love's
just not enough.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.620
Oh, my God.
Go.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.054
[dryer buzzes]

01:00.161 --> 01:02.163
[crying]

01:03.331 --> 01:04.332
[clanging]

01:06.167 --> 01:07.801
Tommy?

01:12.206 --> 01:13.574
[sighs]

01:13.607 --> 01:15.109
[louder clangs]

01:16.144 --> 01:17.278
Hello?

01:22.616 --> 01:23.751
Tommy?

01:27.621 --> 01:29.157
Hello?

01:34.828 --> 01:35.796
[loud flapping]

01:35.829 --> 01:37.831
[screams]

01:37.865 --> 01:40.368
Damn it, Baretta.
You jerk.

01:40.401 --> 01:41.769
[sighs]

01:41.802 --> 01:43.271
They let you out again.

01:45.173 --> 01:46.607
Mrs. Clifford?

01:46.640 --> 01:49.810
Baretta escaped again.

01:49.843 --> 01:54.515
Oh, God.
It's disgusting in here.

01:54.548 --> 01:56.917
Mrs. Clifford?

01:56.950 --> 01:59.587
I'm putting him back in.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.155
There you go.

02:01.189 --> 02:02.190
[parrot squawks]

02:07.428 --> 02:09.363
Okay, so I'm going to take off.

02:09.397 --> 02:12.166
Just make sure
that that door is closed.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.667
Otherwise--

02:23.844 --> 02:25.446
[screams]

02:26.914 --> 02:27.881
[parrot squawks]

02:27.915 --> 02:29.283
No signs of forced entry.

02:29.317 --> 02:30.551
Two bodies in the kitchen.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.320
Looks like he got them
before breakfast.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.388
Simon Clifford, 47.

02:34.422 --> 02:35.589
Dead about five hours.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.358
Deep cut across the throat.

02:37.391 --> 02:38.926
Probably attacked from behind.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.728
Check out the shallow wound
beneath his chin.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.563
(Stabler)
Hesitation mark.

02:42.596 --> 02:43.797
(Warner)
It's from the blade.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.899
Most likely a gut hook
hunting knife.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.568
Typically used
for butchering.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.570
Lovely.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.639
Lila Clifford
was on the run.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.407
Cut's not nearly as clean.

02:53.441 --> 02:54.875
Perp probably caught
the husband by surprise.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.510
Wife saw it happen,
tried to get away.

02:56.544 --> 02:58.646
The third victim
wasn't cut at all.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.914
Amy Clifford, 16.

03:00.948 --> 03:04.285
Signs of sexual assault,
but no semen or spermicide.

03:04.318 --> 03:06.787
Either he couldn't get it up,
or got scared off.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.522
He choked her.

03:08.556 --> 03:12.493
(Stabler)
Each one of them
up close and personal.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.594
He's some killer.

03:13.627 --> 03:17.398
I'll show you
the kids' room.

03:17.431 --> 03:19.833
Ryan, aged nine.
Rebecca, aged seven.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.335
Never showed up
for school today.

03:21.369 --> 03:22.870
No blood, no bodies.

03:22.903 --> 03:25.639
Nobody knows
where they are.

03:25.673 --> 03:26.807
Sure we do.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.760
(Benson)
We got these from the school.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.695
They're the most recent pictures
of Ryan and Rebecca.

04:21.729 --> 04:22.930
We'll release them
to the media.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.765
All bridges and tunnels
around Manhattan.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.700
Amber alert's
already gone out.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.869
[shouting]
What else we got?

04:28.902 --> 04:30.771
Family's lived here seven years.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.072
Turning out pretty sketchy.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.608
Mom and Dad both popped
for drug possession.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.844
Oldest son in Sing Sing
for armed robbery.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.046
We'll get a list
of known associates.

04:39.079 --> 04:40.648
Sounds like it's
going to be a long one.

04:40.681 --> 04:41.749
Well, we're tracking down
the relatives.

04:41.782 --> 04:42.850
There's none local.

04:42.883 --> 04:43.817
So phones and cells
are being dumped.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.953
O'Halloran's trying
to get your attention.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.321
[whistling]

04:48.756 --> 04:49.723
(O'Halloran)
Check this out.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.959
See the depression in the soil?

04:51.992 --> 04:54.562
Made by the same pair
of heavy-soled boots or shoes.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.730
Looks like hundreds of prints
in a tight circle.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.966
Someone's been standing here
for a while.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.568
Yeah, and look what I got
a perfect view of.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.870
(Benson)
Ryan and Rebecca's bedroom.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.838
At night, lights on inside,
it's a free show.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.407
(Fin)
Captain!

05:06.440 --> 05:09.009
This is Mr. Schwartz.
He's the super of the building.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.845
He knows Lila's first husband
and the kids' real dad.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.714
So Simon Clifford
was their stepfather.

05:13.747 --> 05:14.748
Right.

05:14.782 --> 05:15.849
Married Lila last fall.

05:15.883 --> 05:19.587
But they shacked up almost
right after Glen moved out.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.555
(Fin)
Glen Portney.

05:21.589 --> 05:23.791
Split two years ago.
Big custody fight.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.759
To this day,
they're still fighting.

05:25.793 --> 05:26.794
This is my weekend,

05:26.827 --> 05:28.562
no no no,
this is my weekend.

05:28.596 --> 05:29.797
Glen ever get violent
with her?

05:29.830 --> 05:30.831
They both did.

05:30.864 --> 05:33.967
Yelling out on the street
at 3:00 in the morning.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.836
Did you see them around
this morning?

05:35.869 --> 05:38.038
No, but he was around
night before last.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.007
They fight then?

05:40.040 --> 05:40.808
He threatened to kill her.

05:40.841 --> 05:44.011
But he does that
on a regular basis.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.012
I didn't do this.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.013
(Stabler)
Prove it, Glen.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.415
How could I?

05:47.448 --> 05:48.816
Amy?

05:48.849 --> 05:50.684
I would never do anything
to hurt her.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.520
But you'd kill your ex.

05:52.553 --> 05:53.687
That was just talk.

05:53.721 --> 05:54.988
(Benson)
That's big talk, Glen.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.090
You said you were going
to kick her head in

05:57.124 --> 05:59.126
and dump her
in the East River.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.928
I was angry.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.796
She wanted to move the kids
to Florida.

06:02.830 --> 06:03.931
So you slit her throat
instead of kicking her head in.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.499
No!

06:05.533 --> 06:09.036
I was never gonna do anything.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.838
They make you crazy.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.441
They know which buttons
to push.

06:13.474 --> 06:16.043
Death threats
are a little extreme.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.912
She was letting a drug addict
raise my kids!

06:18.946 --> 06:20.914
Please.

06:20.948 --> 06:23.417
Do you have any idea
where Ryan and Rebecca are?

06:23.451 --> 06:25.886
Why don't you tell us?

06:25.919 --> 06:27.154
Search my house.

06:27.187 --> 06:29.156
Do whatever you want.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.958
Oh, God.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.926
I've got to tell
my son Calvin.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.928
That's being taken care of.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.700
(Munch)
We're very sorry
for your losses, Calvin.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.001
But now we need your help.

06:41.034 --> 06:41.835
Who would do this?

06:41.869 --> 06:43.771
We were hoping you'd
have some idea.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.138
You making friends inside?

06:45.172 --> 06:46.440
Why?

06:46.474 --> 06:48.108
'Cause friends
come with enemies.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.843
You think somebody
in here did this?

06:49.877 --> 06:52.045
It only takes a phone call.
You in the Aryan Nation?

06:52.079 --> 06:53.447
No.

06:53.481 --> 06:55.649
(Fin)
I already seen the 8-8
on your wrist, brother Calvin.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.084
Eighth letter of the alphabet.
H, H.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.219
Heil Hitler.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.021
Look, I like my ass
the way that it is.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.023
So I gotta
fall in with somebody.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.191
You know, the Aryans
are killing more of their own

07:04.224 --> 07:05.593
than anybody else
these days.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.528
Nice knowing you, Adolf.

07:07.561 --> 07:09.930
I don't know what else
to do, okay?

07:09.963 --> 07:12.032
You don't know
how it is in here.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.034
Nobody's going to protect me.

07:14.067 --> 07:17.137
I mostly keep to myself.

07:17.170 --> 07:20.641
I know I didn't piss anyone off
enough to kill my family.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.510
I got no reason
to lie about that.

07:22.543 --> 07:26.947
Okay, how about acquaintances
of your mother and stepdad?

07:26.980 --> 07:27.981
He's not my stepdad.

07:28.015 --> 07:30.684
But he's scum, so he probably
hangs out with scum.

07:30.718 --> 07:33.120
When's the last time you talked
to your brother and sister?

07:33.153 --> 07:35.055
A week ago.

07:35.088 --> 07:37.090
To Rebecca.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.194
I think something was wrong.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.930
Why?

07:42.963 --> 07:45.098
She answered the phone in
the middle of the school day.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.734
I asked her
why she wasn't in school.

07:46.767 --> 07:47.835
She said they sent her home.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.837
Mom was...
real weird about it.

07:49.870 --> 07:55.676
Something bad happened,
but she wouldn't say what.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.210
(Mrs. Oliver)
Rebecca didn't do
anything wrong.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.012
She was sent home
because she was upset

07:59.046 --> 08:00.047
about the man
in the schoolyard.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.014
What man?

08:01.048 --> 08:02.916
Rebecca and her friends
were outside playing

08:02.950 --> 08:04.952
when some man
tried to talk to them.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.787
I only found out about it

08:06.820 --> 08:08.589
when one of the kids
came and told me.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.090
By the time I got there,

08:10.123 --> 08:10.958
Rebecca was at the fence.

08:10.991 --> 08:14.094
And he was....

08:14.127 --> 08:15.529
he was masturbating.

08:15.563 --> 08:17.030
Okay.
So what'd you do?

08:17.064 --> 08:18.031
I pulled her away.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.032
And he ran off.

08:19.066 --> 08:20.300
Security couldn't find him.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.636
Several of the girls,
including Rebecca,

08:22.670 --> 08:25.005
were so upset
that the nurse sent them home.

08:25.038 --> 08:28.041
The police said that
I probably scared him off.

08:28.075 --> 08:30.077
And he wouldn't try it again.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.946
But I drew this just in case.

08:35.983 --> 08:38.185
I'm the art teacher.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.653
(Benson)
We should hire this woman.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.021
That's the best sketch
I've ever seen.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.590
Precinct that
caught the school case

08:42.623 --> 08:43.891
posted them all over
the neighborhood.

08:43.924 --> 08:44.892
They had no other leads.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.794
All right, get this
out to the media right away.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.161
They're basically waiting
for him to try his same tricks.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.296
Well, I wish
he would have.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.665
Nobody would expect
public indecency

08:51.699 --> 08:53.834
to escalate
into a triple homicide,

08:53.867 --> 08:55.202
let alone a double kidnapping.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.970
I mean, if this is our guy,
he's lost it.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.706
Or he had nothing to lose.

08:58.739 --> 09:01.008
Somebody emptied out
Lila Clifford's bank account.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.009
How?

09:02.042 --> 09:03.644
ATM in Midtown.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.713
The account only had
about 60 bucks in it.

09:05.746 --> 09:06.714
So he'd be looking for more.

09:06.747 --> 09:07.715
How long ago?

09:07.748 --> 09:09.617
Bank said two hours.

09:09.650 --> 09:10.618
Get that sketch out
to the neighborhood.

09:10.651 --> 09:11.752
See if anybody saw him.

09:11.785 --> 09:14.087
Check the ATM security camera,
have the video enhanced.

09:14.121 --> 09:14.988
...asking for your help.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.157
Anyone who has seen
Ryan or Rebecca

09:17.190 --> 09:20.861
is urged to call the Manhattan
Special Victims Unit.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.163
(Morales)
Just got the footage
right now.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.265
Haven't even looked at it.

09:27.768 --> 09:28.769
It's the security camera tape

09:28.802 --> 09:31.672
from the ATM
at the corner of 47th and 2nd.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.741
This is the time code
for when the card was used.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.609
Hold on.
Go back, go back.

09:35.643 --> 09:37.978
There, at the bottom
of the screen.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.913
Right there.
Pause it.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.882
It looks like a child.

09:41.915 --> 09:42.950
Blonde hair.

09:42.983 --> 09:45.218
He made the boy Ryan
use the ATM.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.154
Smart--he's too short
for the camera.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.922
Mom must have told him
the PIN number.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.724
Wish I could have
shown you more.
[cell phone rings]

09:50.758 --> 09:52.225
Well, you've shown us that
one of the kids is still alive.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.226
That helps.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.662
Benson.

09:54.695 --> 09:57.097
That was quick.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.332
Made an I.D.
on the sketch.

10:01.334 --> 10:02.836
(man)
I remembered him right away

10:02.870 --> 10:04.337
'cause he bought this
about a month ago.

10:04.371 --> 10:05.405
(Fin)
Spotting scope.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.140
Top of the line--
two grand.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.642
Only sold three ever.

10:08.676 --> 10:09.943
Digital camera,

10:09.977 --> 10:11.945
auto focus,
telephoto lens.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.046
What else did he buy?

10:13.080 --> 10:15.115
A couple of
kids' sleeping bags.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.417
Rope.
And this hunting knife, here.

10:17.450 --> 10:20.420
High-carbon stainless
with a gut hook.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.322
No background check required
on that, I suppose.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.091
Hey, cash or plastic.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.727
And he opted for the latter.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.097
And we check I.D.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.098
Thanks.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.766
Victor Paul Gitano.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.873
(Cragen)
Arrested six weeks ago
in Pennsylvania

10:39.907 --> 10:41.842
for molesting
a nine-year-old girl.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.377
Subsequently skipped bail.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.346
Registered as a sex offender

10:46.379 --> 10:49.382
for rape of a child
with serious bodily injury.

10:49.416 --> 10:54.087
The sex offender status was
a result of a 1987 conviction,

10:54.121 --> 10:57.024
when he served 18 years
for raping a 12-year-old boy.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.025
[loud bang]

10:58.058 --> 10:59.827
Police!

10:59.860 --> 11:01.094
(Cragen)
He held the boy prisoner
for eight hours,

11:01.128 --> 11:03.463
during which time
he also tortured him.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.965
Burned his body
with cigarettes,

11:04.998 --> 11:06.133
cut him with a hunting knife,

11:06.166 --> 11:07.167
and sodomized him.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.002
Bedroom's clear!

11:09.036 --> 11:10.170
Clear.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.171
Clear.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.205
(Stabler)
Got something.

11:14.942 --> 11:17.811
Little girl was here.

11:17.845 --> 11:20.180
We missed them.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.418
"Mr. Gitano
has self-reported

11:25.452 --> 11:27.054
"that as a teenager,

11:27.087 --> 11:29.189
"he sexually assaulted more than
a dozen boys and girls.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.323
All strangers."

11:30.357 --> 11:31.859
What are you reading?

11:31.892 --> 11:34.061
Gitano's end-of-sentence
psychiatric evaluation.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.162
He maxed out his prison time.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.164
Pennsylvania was attempting
to civilly commit him.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.266
"Sexuality and inflicting pain

11:39.299 --> 11:41.001
were fused for him
at an early age."

11:41.034 --> 11:42.970
He was a pedophile
even back then.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.271
Well, actually, I don't
believe that Gitano

11:44.304 --> 11:46.106
is a pedophile
in the classic sense.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.007
He's a sadist.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.408
And I suspect that
he chooses children

11:48.441 --> 11:49.910
because they're just
easier to control.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.311
(Fin)
Tools of the trade.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.246
"Mr. Gitano was sexually excited
by violence.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.882
"Pornography does not
interest him

11:54.915 --> 11:56.483
unless it depicts pain."

11:56.516 --> 11:59.286
This would be
Victor's version of Juggs.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.088
Methods of Torture
in the Middle Ages?

12:01.121 --> 12:02.089
In a manner of speaking.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.090
Look at these.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.758
Surgery texts,
autopsy books.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.760
All depicting bodies
being cut apart.

12:06.794 --> 12:08.929
Who wrote up
that evaluation?

12:08.962 --> 12:10.230
Dr. Paula Greenfield,

12:10.263 --> 12:11.999
with the Pennsylvania
Department of Corrections.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.201
Gitano was in her treatment
program for sexual offenders

12:14.234 --> 12:16.236
for nearly three years
before she kicked him out.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.437
Why?

12:17.470 --> 12:20.340
"Mr. Gitano has demonstrated
no effort to stop his behavior.

12:20.373 --> 12:22.175
"He has refused
to participate in therapy

12:22.209 --> 12:23.543
"and expressed desire

12:23.576 --> 12:26.279
to continue his behavior
upon release."

12:26.313 --> 12:28.081
So she just gave up?

12:28.115 --> 12:28.882
Well, there was nothing
she could have done

12:28.916 --> 12:30.183
that would have
made any difference.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.351
Oh, yeah?
Here's something for you.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.953
Commit the bastard.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.856
He didn't fit the criteria.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.991
She said he expressed desire
to continue the behavior.

12:38.025 --> 12:39.192
That sounds
like re-offending to me.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.293
Yes, but you see,

12:40.327 --> 12:43.496
psychotherapy encourages you
to express your desires.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.932
You have to admit
your fantasies

12:44.965 --> 12:46.066
without the fear
of being punished

12:46.099 --> 12:47.234
as a part of the treatment.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.468
Well, that's
a bunch of B.S.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.070
"Although there
are grave concerns

12:50.103 --> 12:52.372
"Mr. Gitano is still
a risk to the community,

12:52.405 --> 12:53.974
"there is insufficient evidence

12:54.007 --> 12:55.108
"to indicate
he meets the criteria

12:55.142 --> 12:56.409
for civil commitment."

12:56.443 --> 12:58.545
She's practically begging
the Corrections Department

12:58.578 --> 12:59.913
to dig up more evidence.

12:59.947 --> 13:02.515
Here's something.

13:02.549 --> 13:05.919
The clothes he wore
to kill the Cliffords.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.087
Maybe Paula Greenfield

13:07.120 --> 13:09.122
can help us figure out
his next move.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.393
(Greenfield)
Gitano planned this for months,

13:13.426 --> 13:14.928
maybe years.

13:14.962 --> 13:17.097
The identity of the victims
didn't matter.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.431
It was the planning
that excited him.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.867
Coffee?
No, thanks.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.468
Do you have any idea
where he might have gone?

13:21.501 --> 13:23.203
Any place
that he feels safe?

13:23.236 --> 13:25.005
Not a clue.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.940
I'm not even entirely sure

13:26.974 --> 13:29.242
what his life was like
before incarceration.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.044
He was a consummate liar.

13:31.078 --> 13:33.313
He was molested by his mother,

13:33.346 --> 13:37.017
or his mother was an angel.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.853
He moved around because
his father was in the military,

13:39.887 --> 13:41.521
or he never knew his father.

13:41.554 --> 13:44.291
After a while, you realize
he's just playing you.

13:44.324 --> 13:47.294
Men like Gitano were the reason
I left the prisons.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.629
These kinds of sex offenders

13:49.662 --> 13:51.064
have the worst kind
of pathology.

13:51.098 --> 13:52.065
Because they make you believe

13:52.099 --> 13:54.167
that you can help them.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.303
You can't help a sociopath.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.971
This whole debate
about whether or not

13:58.005 --> 14:00.207
sex offenders can be cured?

14:00.240 --> 14:01.909
Can I cure you

14:01.942 --> 14:03.376
of needing oxygen?

14:03.410 --> 14:06.613
And yet you thought that
you could help Victor Gitano.

14:06.646 --> 14:09.116
He's cunning.

14:09.149 --> 14:12.452
Not...not book smart
or intelligent.

14:12.485 --> 14:15.422
But he sees weakness in you.

14:15.455 --> 14:16.990
And he exploits it.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.960
And what was your weakness?

14:19.993 --> 14:23.096
My revulsion.

14:23.130 --> 14:26.934
I listened to every intricate,
intimate detail

14:26.967 --> 14:28.235
of how he mutilated,

14:28.268 --> 14:30.270
or tormented,

14:30.303 --> 14:33.140
or terrorized,

14:33.173 --> 14:35.909
or humiliated a child.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.277
He would sit for an hour,

14:37.310 --> 14:38.478
weaving his tales

14:38.511 --> 14:41.982
as if he were speaking about
a pleasant childhood memory.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.417
I couldn't wait
to get out of the room.

14:44.451 --> 14:47.520
He knew that.

14:47.554 --> 14:51.058
He used that.

14:51.091 --> 14:52.960
And in the end,
I think that my...

14:52.993 --> 14:57.064
great accomplishment
was teaching him how to imitate

14:57.097 --> 14:58.465
normal human behavior.

14:58.498 --> 15:02.469
Essentially, I made him
even more dangerous.

15:02.502 --> 15:06.339
Well, I used to treat sex
offenders early in my career.

15:06.373 --> 15:08.141
But after a while,
it just wasn't enough

15:08.175 --> 15:10.310
to get a guy
to admit his fantasies

15:10.343 --> 15:12.545
about his
two-month-old daughter.

15:15.648 --> 15:18.918
So why do you think
I try to catch them now?

15:22.255 --> 15:23.623
Is there anything
that you can tell me

15:23.656 --> 15:25.658
that might help us
catch Gitano?

15:28.261 --> 15:31.464
I've got his journals.

15:31.498 --> 15:34.567
And several taped sessions.

15:34.601 --> 15:38.371
And I have spoken
with some of his victims.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.607
I'm not sure any of it
will help you catch him.

15:40.640 --> 15:44.744
But at least you'll know
what you're dealing with.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.213
(Gitano)
The incredible part

15:46.246 --> 15:47.714
was the blood.

15:47.747 --> 15:51.018
I--I'd never seen
so much of it.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.386
Maybe he had a--
a disease or something,

15:53.420 --> 15:54.321
because it was...

15:54.354 --> 15:56.489
I mean, it was just,
it was all over us.

15:56.523 --> 15:58.658
(Jake)
I didn't really know him.

15:58.691 --> 16:01.061
I'd seen him
around the neighborhood.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.063
One day he stopped me

16:03.096 --> 16:06.666
as I was walking
home from school.

16:06.699 --> 16:11.104
He had something
to show me, he said.

16:11.138 --> 16:15.008
Took me to these woods
behind our street.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.513
That's when
he took out the knife.

16:20.547 --> 16:23.650
[Greenfield on video tape]
Why do you think
the blood stuck in your mind?

16:23.683 --> 16:25.518
Well, I suppose, uh...

16:25.552 --> 16:27.654
I suppose it was because
he was,

16:27.687 --> 16:29.122
he was such a--

16:29.156 --> 16:30.290
Such a little boy.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.192
Small, you know?

16:32.225 --> 16:34.794
Small bones,
hardly any muscle.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.597
Had, uh, this
fair, pale skin.

16:37.630 --> 16:41.301
Like a baby.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.336
And it was just kind of funny.

16:43.370 --> 16:46.706
That so much blood could
come out of a little person.

16:48.141 --> 16:51.578
Isn't it?

16:51.611 --> 16:54.181
(Jake)
I kept begging him to stop.

16:54.214 --> 16:57.117
I never knew people

16:57.150 --> 17:00.453
would do things like that
to your body.

17:01.854 --> 17:06.593
Never knew people
could be so evil.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.331
I don't leave here.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.233
You know?

17:14.801 --> 17:18.071
I haven't gone outside
for years.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.375
I have a job over the phone.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.644
I help people
with their computers.

17:26.446 --> 17:28.215
Order anything I want
on the Internet.

17:30.317 --> 17:31.351
Got TV.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.657
It's not a bad life.

17:37.690 --> 17:40.160
It's not a bad life at all.

17:40.193 --> 17:42.462
[Greenfield on video tape]
What do you think
happened to that boy?

17:42.495 --> 17:45.565
Him?
I don't know.

17:45.598 --> 17:48.501
He lived, though,
I know that.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.670
I think he testified against me
a couple of times.

17:50.703 --> 17:54.174
I don't--
I don't really think about it.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.610
How many more
of these tapes you got?

17:57.644 --> 17:59.612
15.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.714
Well, watch them
in your own office.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.283
I'm done.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.452
I don't know how useful
they'll be for our purposes.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.320
There's no new understanding

18:07.354 --> 18:09.522
I can glean from watching him
lie over and over.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.558
Well, here's what
I don't understand.

18:11.591 --> 18:14.227
Why did he decide
to murder three people

18:14.261 --> 18:15.395
to kidnap his victims?

18:15.428 --> 18:17.497
It's completely new behavior.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.399
His arrest six weeks ago
was probably the trigger.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.601
He had a fantasy
that he wanted to fulfill

18:21.634 --> 18:22.902
before he got put away for life.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.238
Unfortunately,
he got the chance

18:25.272 --> 18:28.541
when the judge from Pennsylvania
granted him bail.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.877
You think those kids
are still alive?

18:30.910 --> 18:32.545
I don't know.

18:32.579 --> 18:33.546
But if they are,

18:33.580 --> 18:35.815
they won't be for much longer.

18:35.848 --> 18:36.849
Gitano was just spotted

18:36.883 --> 18:39.619
at the George Washington Bridge
bus terminal.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.554
(agent)
He was here
about 45 minutes ago.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.923
He said he was expecting
a $500 money transfer.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.525
I didn't recognize him
until I saw the kids.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.327
(Benson)
He had the little boy
and girl with him?

18:47.360 --> 18:50.630
They were just standing there.
Like zombies.
Where'd they go?

18:50.663 --> 18:52.599
Well, there actually wasn't
a money transfer in his name.

18:52.632 --> 18:53.766
But I told him that there was.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.935
I said I just had
to process it.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.804
Figured that would stall him
until you guys got here.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.572
I just felt so bad
for those kids.

18:59.606 --> 19:01.674
I told him
it would be ready by 4:00.

19:01.708 --> 19:04.811
That's any minute.
We need ears.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.346
You can use this room.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.448
This guy'll get spooked
if he sees a cop.

19:08.481 --> 19:09.682
Pull back
all uniformed officers

19:09.716 --> 19:11.384
and replace them
with plainclothes.

19:11.418 --> 19:12.685
Range should work
through most of the terminal.

19:12.719 --> 19:15.388
Have all responding units
come in silent.

19:15.422 --> 19:17.757
I don't think we can wait.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.830
(terminal announcer)
Attention please.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.433
There will be no parking...

19:27.834 --> 19:30.870
All vehicles must be parked in
authorized parking areas only.

19:30.903 --> 19:36.409
Any vehicle left unattended
will be ticketed and towed.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.246
You know,
I've been thinking.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.747
This guy's probably
going to be really mad.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.715
Well, not at you.
Don't worry about it.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.417
Yeah, but he killed people,
right?

19:44.451 --> 19:46.619
I should probably
call my manager.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.755
Just relax.
Do what you normally do, okay?

19:48.788 --> 19:50.423
This is what
I normally do.

19:50.457 --> 19:52.625
Do it without
looking terrified.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.630
(agent whispers)
Heads up.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.266
Right there.
That's him.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.300
He's coming.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.543
He's coming at you.
No kids.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.979
Ryan and Rebecca have
to be around here somewhere.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.614
Fin, look for those kids.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.565
He's looking
right at us.

20:32.599 --> 20:35.302
All right, I think
I'm spooking him. Look away.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.369
Look away.

20:36.403 --> 20:38.271
Don't leave me!

20:38.305 --> 20:40.673
What do I do?

21:11.504 --> 21:12.839
He's running!

21:29.389 --> 21:30.923
Did you see him?

21:30.957 --> 21:32.659
No.
Split up.

21:32.692 --> 21:33.726
Yeah.

21:33.760 --> 21:34.894
Fin.
Gitano made us.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.596
No sign of the kids.

21:36.629 --> 21:37.730
I'll grab him up top.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.967
Out of the way!

22:04.491 --> 22:07.326
[cries and murmurs]

22:08.495 --> 22:11.664
Move, move, move.
Police, out of my way.

22:11.698 --> 22:13.666
Out of the way, move.

22:15.902 --> 22:18.371
Ryan.

22:18.405 --> 22:19.572
Ryan!

22:19.606 --> 22:20.873
Hey, buddy.

22:20.907 --> 22:22.609
Come here.

22:22.642 --> 22:25.144
[girl screams]

22:25.177 --> 22:26.613
Freeze!

22:29.181 --> 22:32.084
(woman)
Oh! Oh, my God!

22:37.557 --> 22:38.558
Move!

22:38.591 --> 22:40.727
Olivia!

22:40.760 --> 22:42.094
Oh, my God.
No!

22:42.128 --> 22:43.930
No.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.765
It's okay.

22:45.798 --> 22:47.033
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

22:47.066 --> 22:48.668
Where's Gitano?
Go, Elliot.

22:48.701 --> 22:52.439
Go, I'm fine.
Go. Go!

22:59.045 --> 23:00.780
(Stabler)
Fin?

23:00.813 --> 23:02.715
Don't.
What is it?

23:02.749 --> 23:03.716
Killed him, Elliot.

23:03.750 --> 23:06.085
He cut his throat.

23:22.101 --> 23:23.135
The girl?

23:23.169 --> 23:26.005
What about the girl?

23:26.038 --> 23:28.174
Gitano still had her
in his arms.

23:28.207 --> 23:30.710
Then he just
disappeared.

23:43.222 --> 23:44.724
(EMT)
Your lucky day, Detective.

23:44.757 --> 23:47.527
Couple more centimeters,
you'd be buying a pine box.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.562
You won't even need a stitch.

23:50.763 --> 23:53.466
I don't suppose you want
a day or two off.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.135
Yeah.

23:56.168 --> 23:59.205
I didn't think so.

23:59.238 --> 24:01.040
We got reports of sightings
on the bridge,

24:01.073 --> 24:02.942
uptown A train,
downtown nine.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.477
Nothing solid.

24:04.511 --> 24:06.513
That kid was
right in front of me,

24:06.546 --> 24:07.680
five yards away.

24:10.249 --> 24:13.219
Why didn't he run?

24:13.252 --> 24:14.621
He was traumatized, Elliot.

24:14.654 --> 24:16.689
This man murdered
his mother and sister,

24:16.723 --> 24:18.157
possibly right
in front of him.

24:18.190 --> 24:19.592
All I had to do
was grab him.

24:19.626 --> 24:21.093
A few steps
and just grab him.

24:21.127 --> 24:22.862
Now, look, let's not
go down this road right now.

24:22.895 --> 24:23.896
Elliot, it was chaos.

24:23.930 --> 24:25.164
There was nothing
that you--

24:25.197 --> 24:27.500
Please, don't try
to help me out right now.

24:27.534 --> 24:30.236
Why did Gitano bring them
to this location

24:30.269 --> 24:31.538
and risk getting IDed?

24:31.571 --> 24:32.404
Maybe he's local.

24:32.438 --> 24:33.840
He could be holed up
in the neighborhood.

24:33.873 --> 24:34.841
(female officer)
Captain!

24:34.874 --> 24:37.744
Just got word of a carjacking
two blocks away.

24:37.777 --> 24:39.679
He had a little girl
with him.
Go.

24:39.712 --> 24:40.713
I was driving up the street.

24:40.747 --> 24:42.114
He just jumped
in front of my car.

24:42.148 --> 24:43.683
He had this little girl
in his arms.

24:43.716 --> 24:45.017
He--there was blood
all over him.

24:45.051 --> 24:45.852
Was the girl hurt?

24:45.885 --> 24:47.554
I don't know.
I mean, she was crying.

24:47.587 --> 24:48.921
He pulls out this big knife.

24:48.955 --> 24:50.156
He tells me
to get out of the car.

24:50.189 --> 24:51.223
I just did what
he told me to do.

24:51.257 --> 24:52.091
I mean,
I was so scared.

24:52.124 --> 24:53.760
Get all the information
on the car.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.562
Officer Ramirez here
will take you home.

24:55.595 --> 24:57.063
Thank you.

24:57.096 --> 24:59.031
Hey, let's get
back to the house.

24:59.065 --> 25:00.933
Wait.

25:00.967 --> 25:02.234
Look, this is the one street

25:02.268 --> 25:04.136
that we know
that he's not on.

25:04.170 --> 25:05.838
Elliot!

25:05.872 --> 25:08.074
Elliot, what the hell
are you doing?

25:08.107 --> 25:10.109
Car has a flat tire.

25:10.142 --> 25:11.711
So what?

25:11.744 --> 25:14.213
Why here?
Why'd he come to this street?

25:14.246 --> 25:15.281
Because he knows
that the bus station

25:15.314 --> 25:16.749
is crawling
with law enforcement.

25:16.783 --> 25:18.284
Yeah, or he was coming back
to get his car.

25:18.317 --> 25:19.886
But he couldn't drive it,
so he took another.

25:19.919 --> 25:22.088
How do you know
that this is his car?

25:22.121 --> 25:23.556
Check out the tags.

25:23.590 --> 25:25.291
There are none.
He stole this.

25:28.695 --> 25:31.964
And now we know who's supposed
to send him the money.

25:31.998 --> 25:35.267
Eddie Loomis, 500 bucks.
Area code 856.

25:35.301 --> 25:37.103
That's South Jersey.

25:37.136 --> 25:38.605
I didn't send the money.

25:38.638 --> 25:40.072
He thought you did.

25:40.106 --> 25:41.140
I said I would.

25:41.173 --> 25:42.141
Don't lie to me.

25:42.174 --> 25:43.075
I'm not.

25:43.109 --> 25:44.744
I just wanted
to get him off the phone.

25:44.777 --> 25:45.745
It was 4:00 in the morning.

25:45.778 --> 25:46.913
Hey Eddie, right now,

25:46.946 --> 25:49.015
you're an accessory
to murder.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.050
No, I have no idea
what he did.

25:51.083 --> 25:52.084
Don't lie to me.

25:52.118 --> 25:52.919
Where did Gitano get--
How do you know him again?

25:52.952 --> 25:53.653
We were buddies
in the Air Force.

25:53.686 --> 25:55.988
I haven't seen him in 20 years.

25:56.022 --> 25:56.989
Where is he right now?

25:57.023 --> 25:58.324
I have no idea!

25:58.357 --> 25:59.726
Where was Gitano calling--

25:59.759 --> 26:01.027
If I find out
you know anything--

26:01.060 --> 26:02.361
Anything.

26:02.394 --> 26:03.896
I'm going to hunt you down.

26:05.932 --> 26:08.935
You're free to go.

26:11.103 --> 26:13.072
Hey.

26:13.105 --> 26:14.841
Hey.
He doesn't know anything.

26:14.874 --> 26:15.942
You got something
you want to say to me?

26:15.975 --> 26:17.143
'Cause if you do,
let's hear it.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.249
Why didn't you shoot Gitano?

26:23.282 --> 26:25.652
He was using the child
as a shield.

26:25.685 --> 26:26.786
How could you let him
get so close to you?

26:26.819 --> 26:28.187
There were
innocent civilians around.

26:28.220 --> 26:29.255
I couldn't get a shot.

26:29.288 --> 26:31.223
Well, he got close,
and Ryan's dead.

26:31.257 --> 26:33.125
So this is my fault?

26:33.159 --> 26:34.761
I can't do this anymore.

26:34.794 --> 26:36.262
I can't be
looking over my shoulder,

26:36.295 --> 26:37.163
making sure you're okay.

26:37.196 --> 26:39.198
You son of a bitch.
You know that's not--

26:39.231 --> 26:40.733
I need to know
you can do your job

26:40.767 --> 26:42.268
and not wait for me
to come to the rescue.

26:42.301 --> 26:43.335
(Cragen)
All right, that's enough.

26:43.369 --> 26:46.105
Knock it off.

26:46.138 --> 26:47.640
Now, in case
you've forgotten,

26:47.674 --> 26:49.341
there's still a little girl
out there with a psycho.

26:49.375 --> 26:50.843
If we're lucky,

26:50.877 --> 26:52.244
and he hasn't already
slit her throat.

26:52.278 --> 26:53.680
If I have to say this
again to you,

26:53.713 --> 26:56.749
you're both suspended.

26:56.783 --> 26:58.851
Now get your asses
down to the morgue.

26:58.885 --> 27:01.287
Warner's got
something to show you.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.222
How's the search?

27:03.255 --> 27:04.256
Sucks.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.257
Too bad.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.192
When you find this monster,

27:06.225 --> 27:08.661
give him a special
kick in the nuts for me.

27:08.695 --> 27:10.229
Will you?
So what have we got?

27:10.262 --> 27:11.964
These are the clothes
the little boy was wearing.

27:11.998 --> 27:14.734
This jacket
is actually an adult size.

27:14.767 --> 27:17.036
So it's either Ryan's
stepfather, or Gitano's.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.037
I'm hoping it's Gitano's.

27:18.070 --> 27:20.172
I want to show you something.
Hit the lights.

27:20.206 --> 27:22.174
When I was taking
autopsy photos,

27:22.208 --> 27:23.175
I noticed something strange.

27:23.209 --> 27:24.143
Watch this.

27:24.176 --> 27:26.946
Flashing.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.114
(Stabler)
What is that?

27:28.147 --> 27:29.849
It's something
phosphorescent.

27:29.882 --> 27:31.117
It reacts to the light.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.151
The lab hopefully--

27:32.184 --> 27:33.452
Why haven't you
already sent it?

27:33.485 --> 27:36.088
I sent it when I saw it,
Detective.

27:36.122 --> 27:37.757
I'm waiting for the results.

27:37.790 --> 27:39.058
So why are we here,
for a light show?

27:39.091 --> 27:40.793
Come on.
Next time, use the phone.

27:42.461 --> 27:47.233
Sometimes all that brooding
intensity is just annoying.

27:47.266 --> 27:51.137
This cell phone
was found with the boy as well.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.705
It's locked.
You'll need a security code.

27:52.739 --> 27:55.441
All the family phones
have been accounted for.

27:55.474 --> 27:58.778
This one must belong
to Gitano.

27:58.811 --> 28:00.279
You are going to love me.

28:00.312 --> 28:02.181
The phone belongs to Gitano.

28:02.214 --> 28:03.182
Better.

28:03.215 --> 28:04.416
It belongs to his employer.

28:04.450 --> 28:05.818
K & V Trucking.

28:05.852 --> 28:07.419
They think his name
is Victor Franklin.

28:07.453 --> 28:09.421
How is that better?

28:09.455 --> 28:11.257
Because,
like many companies,

28:11.290 --> 28:14.260
K & V doesn't entirely
trust their employees.

28:14.293 --> 28:15.127
That's why they opted

28:15.161 --> 28:17.096
for a little
technological reassurance.

28:17.129 --> 28:18.230
Back-end tracking.

28:18.264 --> 28:19.065
Which is?

28:19.098 --> 28:21.233
All cell phones
have GPS locators.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.335
But they only transmit
when 911 is dialed.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.504
The cellular company
offers this service

28:25.537 --> 28:27.273
for an additional fee.

28:27.306 --> 28:30.242
You can track your employees,
or your 15-year-old daughter.

28:30.276 --> 28:31.443
All the time?

28:31.477 --> 28:33.079
As long as
the phone is on.

28:33.112 --> 28:34.814
And it doesn't just
give you the cell site.

28:34.847 --> 28:37.316
Latitude, longitude,
altitude, and speed.

28:37.349 --> 28:40.286
Victor Paul Gitano's whereabouts
for the past month.

28:40.319 --> 28:44.123
You're right.
I do love you.

28:44.156 --> 28:45.958
[knock on door]

28:49.195 --> 28:50.196
Come in.

28:59.205 --> 29:01.808
I heard about yesterday
at the bus terminal.

29:01.841 --> 29:04.043
It's terrible.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.279
I'm really sorry.

29:09.281 --> 29:11.217
You know,
in situations like this--

29:11.250 --> 29:13.920
Please don't tell me there's
nothing I could have done.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.988
Thanks.

29:16.022 --> 29:18.124
I was going to say
that in situations like this,

29:18.157 --> 29:19.992
there's no good choice.

29:20.026 --> 29:22.795
Every choice
becomes a sacrifice.

29:26.132 --> 29:28.534
Not true.

29:28.567 --> 29:30.202
You had to choose

29:30.236 --> 29:32.204
between saving the little boy
or saving Olivia.

29:32.238 --> 29:34.106
Yeah, but she
didn't need me.

29:34.140 --> 29:35.374
You didn't know that.

29:40.046 --> 29:42.181
I wish I didn't...

29:42.214 --> 29:44.116
Didn't what?

29:44.150 --> 29:47.286
Didn't care so much?

29:47.319 --> 29:50.422
Elliot, that's what makes you
a good partner.

29:50.456 --> 29:51.423
She made me turn away.

29:51.457 --> 29:54.393
How?

29:54.426 --> 29:57.429
How did she make you
do anything?

30:03.870 --> 30:06.205
She didn't.

30:06.238 --> 30:07.173
It was my choice.

30:07.206 --> 30:09.241
Nobody else was responsible
for it but me.

30:20.252 --> 30:21.153
Thanks.

30:21.187 --> 30:22.188
Elliot...

30:23.289 --> 30:26.358
[door slams]

30:26.392 --> 30:27.894
[phone rings]

30:27.927 --> 30:30.129
Detective Stabler.

30:30.162 --> 30:31.497
Yeah.

30:31.530 --> 30:33.365
Great, what do you got?

30:37.336 --> 30:38.504
Repeat that second one.

30:42.174 --> 30:43.876
All right, thanks.

30:43.910 --> 30:46.278
Lab results
on the glowing substance

30:46.312 --> 30:47.379
from Gitano's jacket.

30:47.413 --> 30:48.915
What is it?

30:48.948 --> 30:52.251
Traces of copper
and zinc cadmium sulfide.

30:52.284 --> 30:53.252
What the hell is that?

30:53.285 --> 30:54.253
(Munch)
I know what it is.

30:54.286 --> 30:56.022
In the '50s and '60s,

30:56.055 --> 30:58.157
the military secretly sprayed it
all over the country.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.626
They were trying to determine
how nuclear fallout travels,

31:00.659 --> 31:04.897
and zinc cadmium sulfide
is of a similar weight.

31:04.931 --> 31:06.332
Of course, it was later
determined to be carcinogenic,

31:06.365 --> 31:08.100
and the military claimed
they never knew that.

31:08.134 --> 31:09.235
Gitano used to be
Air Force.

31:09.268 --> 31:11.570
Now, how the hell would he
get it on his jacket now?

31:11.603 --> 31:13.039
He could have been
on a military base

31:13.072 --> 31:14.206
where they stored the stuff.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.307
(Munch)
An abandoned installation.

31:15.341 --> 31:17.576
Maybe it was even one of those
EPA Superfund sites.

31:17.609 --> 31:19.545
God knows they haven't
cleaned those up.

31:19.578 --> 31:21.247
You should call Olivia.

31:21.280 --> 31:22.915
Where is she?

31:22.949 --> 31:25.284
Tracking Gitano's cell phone.

31:25.317 --> 31:27.253
She has a list of everywhere
he's been this month.

31:27.286 --> 31:28.320
[dialing phone]

31:28.354 --> 31:31.223
[cell phone rings]

31:31.257 --> 31:33.492
Benson.

31:33.525 --> 31:36.128
Oh, some rat hole restaurant
in Jersey.

31:36.162 --> 31:37.930
They don't remember
seeing Gitano.

31:37.964 --> 31:39.498
Okay, what's your next stop?

31:39.531 --> 31:42.134
[Benson on phone]
I think it's, uh, Canton Road.

31:42.168 --> 31:44.303
Yeah.
Canton Road, near Route 44.

31:44.336 --> 31:46.138
About 15 miles from here.

31:46.172 --> 31:48.207
I'm going to meet you there.

31:48.240 --> 31:52.111
Do you have any military bases
on your list?

31:52.144 --> 31:54.280
(Benson)
I don't think so.
Why?

31:54.313 --> 31:55.347
(Stabler)
Wait for me.

31:58.217 --> 31:59.085
(Stabler)
What is this place?

31:59.118 --> 32:01.387
Metal plating facility.
It looks deserted.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.622
Good a place as any
to hide a kidnap victim.

32:03.655 --> 32:04.790
Yep.

32:04.823 --> 32:07.226
Plus, I think it was once
your military installation.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.294
Check this out.

32:08.327 --> 32:11.597
"Warning,
restricted area."

32:11.630 --> 32:13.432
As per
Secretary of Defense.

32:13.465 --> 32:14.733
I'm calling for backup.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.235
Tell them we can't wait.

32:46.265 --> 32:48.034
[sniffing]

32:48.067 --> 32:49.435
[quietly]
Cigarettes.

33:17.363 --> 33:20.166
[crash, man grunting]

33:22.434 --> 33:24.270
[gunshot]

33:24.303 --> 33:26.138
Drop it!

33:26.172 --> 33:27.439
Drop your weapon now!

33:27.473 --> 33:28.440
Drop it!

33:28.474 --> 33:30.709
Drop it
or I'll shoot him.

33:30.742 --> 33:32.444
Don't be an idiot, Gitano.
Put the gun down--

33:32.478 --> 33:34.280
Pull the trigger.
Don't even think about it.

33:34.313 --> 33:35.614
You hear me?
He's going to die.

33:35.647 --> 33:37.083
I'm gonna kill him.
Shoot him.

33:37.116 --> 33:40.352
Shut up.
Everybody shut up.

33:47.359 --> 33:48.394
Victor.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.096
There's no way out of this.

33:50.129 --> 33:52.498
Stop talking!

33:52.531 --> 33:55.367
You know what's going to happen
if you don't put that gun down.

33:55.401 --> 33:56.535
Now, enough people have died.

33:56.568 --> 33:57.436
Olivia.

33:57.469 --> 33:59.371
And I know that you
don't want to die.

33:59.405 --> 34:00.472
You could have
pulled the trigger

34:00.506 --> 34:01.673
on Detective Stabler.

34:01.707 --> 34:04.510
And then I would have
had to kill you.

34:04.543 --> 34:05.577
But you didn't do that.

34:05.611 --> 34:07.646
You didn't do that,
because you're being smart.

34:07.679 --> 34:08.614
You've only got one chance.

34:08.647 --> 34:10.116
You gotta take it.

34:10.149 --> 34:11.683
Where's Rebecca, Victor?
Is she alive?

34:11.717 --> 34:14.420
I'm not gonna tell you dick
until you drop the gun, bitch!

34:14.453 --> 34:15.421
Shoot him!

34:15.454 --> 34:17.523
Shut up, Elliot.

34:17.556 --> 34:18.824
Stop moving or he's dead.

34:18.857 --> 34:20.459
And then what?

34:20.492 --> 34:23.329
Do you really think that you're
going to walk out of here?

34:23.362 --> 34:25.531
Because that's not
going to happen.

34:25.564 --> 34:27.133
Now, this is your choice.

34:27.166 --> 34:28.400
Dead or alive.

34:28.434 --> 34:29.601
If I go, he goes.

34:29.635 --> 34:31.103
Victor.

34:31.137 --> 34:32.238
Tell us where Rebecca is

34:32.271 --> 34:34.473
and we can end this right now.

34:34.506 --> 34:35.741
Dead.

34:38.710 --> 34:41.580
I used her up
and I bled her dry.

34:41.613 --> 34:43.715
You want to hear
how she screamed?

34:43.749 --> 34:45.651
How she begged
for her mommy?
Stop it.

34:45.684 --> 34:47.586
She was a slut, that one.
A real little whore.

34:47.619 --> 34:49.555
And I'm looking
at a dead man!

34:49.588 --> 34:50.422
Any closer,

34:50.456 --> 34:51.657
and you're gonna be
wearing his brains

34:51.690 --> 34:52.658
on your coat!

34:52.691 --> 34:53.759
(Stabler)
Olivia.

34:53.792 --> 34:54.793
There is no reason

34:54.826 --> 34:55.794
to keep this
piece of crap alive.

34:55.827 --> 34:58.297
Pull the trigger
right now.

34:58.330 --> 34:59.798
Olivia, pull it!

34:59.831 --> 35:01.500
Shoot him!

35:01.533 --> 35:02.501
You know,

35:02.534 --> 35:04.670
you know that little girl--

35:04.703 --> 35:07.873
It's possible
that she isn't dead.

35:07.906 --> 35:10.276
She could be locked up in this
building somewhere, huh?

35:10.309 --> 35:12.211
Or someplace else
50 miles away.

35:12.244 --> 35:13.245
You don't really know, do you?

35:13.279 --> 35:14.246
You're a liar.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.847
Yeah, well,
that's the point.

35:15.881 --> 35:17.516
Tell us where she is, Victor.

35:17.549 --> 35:18.784
She's here.
She's not dead.

35:18.817 --> 35:20.752
Otherwise, he would have been
long gone.

35:20.786 --> 35:21.787
Unless you like them dead.

35:21.820 --> 35:22.788
You sick like that too,
Gitano?

35:22.821 --> 35:24.156
You like to play
with corpses?

35:24.190 --> 35:25.357
Yeah, I love that.
The deader the better.

35:25.391 --> 35:26.658
They don't fight as much.

35:26.692 --> 35:29.161
(Stabler)
Olivia, you think about me,

35:29.195 --> 35:30.362
Rebecca is dead.

35:30.396 --> 35:31.463
Pull that trigger.
Shoot him.

35:31.497 --> 35:32.598
Shoot him.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.300
Olivia, shoot him.

35:34.333 --> 35:35.434
(Gitano)
Yeah, do that.

35:35.467 --> 35:38.904
But you better make sure
you take me out with one shot.

35:38.937 --> 35:40.706
One...

35:40.739 --> 35:43.609
perfect, perfect shot.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.777
Of course, my reflexes
are pretty tight.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.913
I could pull the trigger
before the bullet even hits me.

35:47.946 --> 35:49.648
Or maybe you miss me altogether.

35:49.681 --> 35:52.351
Either way,
there's an 80% chance

35:52.384 --> 35:54.653
I'm gonna take
this guy's head clean off!

35:54.686 --> 35:55.821
But you try it,
definitely.

35:55.854 --> 35:57.523
It'll probably
turn out great.

35:57.556 --> 36:00.759
You can kill us both, Victor.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.761
You'll still never
walk out of here.

36:02.794 --> 36:04.796
Right.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.198
Right, 'cause uh...

36:06.232 --> 36:07.766
'Cause you got
some buddies coming, huh?

36:07.799 --> 36:08.967
When's that going down?

36:09.000 --> 36:09.968
Any minute.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.303
Great.

36:11.337 --> 36:13.205
Great.

36:13.239 --> 36:14.573
Just tell us where you hid her.

36:14.606 --> 36:15.774
(Gitano)
You know, you could
put the gun down.

36:15.807 --> 36:17.643
At least then
you might find her.

36:17.676 --> 36:18.810
Otherwise, she's gonna die.

36:18.844 --> 36:21.547
She's gonna die,
he's gonna die,

36:21.580 --> 36:22.548
and it'll be all your fault.

36:22.581 --> 36:23.615
Just like the little boy.

36:23.649 --> 36:25.551
How's your neck?

36:25.584 --> 36:26.618
It's not the same thing, Olivia.
You know that.

36:26.652 --> 36:28.320
Yes it is,
Olivia.

36:28.354 --> 36:30.656
God, you two.
Couple of screw-ups.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.891
How could you
let that little boy go?

36:32.924 --> 36:33.892
Olivia, look at me.

36:33.925 --> 36:35.294
Maybe you're
just incompetent.

36:35.327 --> 36:36.595
You can do the right thing.
I didn't.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.497
I made that choice with Ryan,
and it was wrong.

36:38.530 --> 36:39.498
Elliot.

36:39.531 --> 36:40.499
It was my fault.

36:40.532 --> 36:41.800
Don't do it.
Shut up!

36:41.833 --> 36:43.569
Don't make that mistake.
Stop talking.

36:43.602 --> 36:45.537
I would have done
the same thing.

36:45.571 --> 36:46.538
I said shut up!

36:46.572 --> 36:49.275
Don't make my mistake.

36:49.308 --> 36:50.709
[door creaks]

36:50.742 --> 36:51.710
Drop it!
Drop the gun!

36:51.743 --> 36:52.744
Drop it now!

36:52.778 --> 36:54.446
Put that gun down now!

36:54.480 --> 36:58.584
You cops don't come in here,
or everybody dies.

36:58.617 --> 36:59.585
Hey.

36:59.618 --> 37:00.519
Hey.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.554
Hey!

37:02.588 --> 37:05.324
I'll tell you where she is.

37:05.357 --> 37:07.426
Where?
She's in a van.

37:07.459 --> 37:09.328
Parked in a garage in Newark.
She might still be alive.

37:11.663 --> 37:12.764
He's lying.

37:12.798 --> 37:14.500
I know.

37:14.533 --> 37:17.002
He's never going to tell us.

37:17.035 --> 37:20.372
You're right.

37:20.406 --> 37:21.573
We can all
walk out of here alive

37:21.607 --> 37:24.310
if you just put the gun down.

37:26.778 --> 37:27.846
It's all right.

37:31.617 --> 37:33.251
I'm sorry.

37:39.591 --> 37:40.692
[rustling]

37:40.726 --> 37:41.693
[gunshot]

37:41.727 --> 37:43.061
Suspect down.

37:43.094 --> 37:47.299
Move in, move in!

37:55.607 --> 38:01.012
Damn, J.B.
You took half his face off.

38:01.046 --> 38:02.681
Nice job stalling him.

38:02.714 --> 38:04.850
Let's get an ambulance
out here anyways.

38:04.883 --> 38:06.585
Might as well
pretend we tried some sort of--

38:06.618 --> 38:07.586
Quiet.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.855
Everybody, quiet.

38:09.888 --> 38:12.591
[faint crying]

38:12.624 --> 38:15.561
(Benson)
Rebecca?

38:19.565 --> 38:21.633
Rebecca Clifford?

38:21.667 --> 38:23.635
Say something, honey.

38:23.669 --> 38:25.036
[faint cry]

38:26.638 --> 38:28.807
Rebecca?

38:28.840 --> 38:30.576
[crying]

38:38.750 --> 38:41.420
Rebecca?

38:42.688 --> 38:45.424
(Stabler)
Rebecca, honey,
come on out.

38:45.457 --> 38:46.425
Come on out.

38:46.458 --> 38:47.626
You're safe now.
Come on out.

38:50.629 --> 38:52.598
Come on out,
Rebecca.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.139
[whispering]
It's okay.

39:01.172 --> 39:04.610
Okay. Okay.

39:04.643 --> 39:07.679
It's okay.
It's okay.

39:16.622 --> 39:17.556
The good news is,

39:17.589 --> 39:19.925
they spent most of their time
on the run.

39:19.958 --> 39:20.826
He didn't have
long enough

39:20.859 --> 39:24.129
to inflict serious
physical injury on her.

39:24.162 --> 39:26.632
How's she doing mentally?

39:26.665 --> 39:28.867
She says she doesn't remember
most of it, so...

39:28.900 --> 39:30.669
We'll see about that.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.805
I called her father.
He's coming down.

39:44.683 --> 39:46.652
If that sniper
hadn't beaten you to it...

39:49.788 --> 39:53.391
I know you would have
taken the shot, Olivia.

39:56.094 --> 39:58.664
No, I wouldn't have.

40:00.799 --> 40:03.935
Did you really
expect me to?

40:03.969 --> 40:07.038
Did you really expect me
to cause your death?

40:09.475 --> 40:11.009
What about your kids?

40:11.042 --> 40:13.645
I don't know.

40:13.679 --> 40:16.047
I just couldn't get that boy
out of my head.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.521
What about me?

40:24.222 --> 40:26.825
Look, we both chose each other
over the job.

40:26.858 --> 40:28.527
We can never
let that happen again.

40:33.031 --> 40:34.065
Otherwise...

40:37.769 --> 40:39.738
We can't be partners.

40:43.575 --> 40:45.544
I can't believe
you're saying that.

40:47.913 --> 40:49.615
You and this job are about

40:49.648 --> 40:51.650
the only things
I've got anymore.

40:55.621 --> 40:57.489
I don't want
to wreck that.

41:02.828 --> 41:04.229
I couldn't take it.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.950
Olivia.
What's up?

41:29.087 --> 41:31.557
I want a new partner.

41:31.590 --> 41:32.924
