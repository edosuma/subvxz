00:01.000 --> 00:02.764
Previously on Eli Stone:

00:02.869 --> 00:06.430
Mr. Stone, a senior associate,
was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm.

00:06.539 --> 00:07.904
I thought you changed.

00:08.007 --> 00:11.842
All that's changed is you're trying to
clean up your record for the hereafter.

00:11.911 --> 00:16.473
All-Star catcher Jayson Turk hit a foul
ball which struck his coach in the head.

00:16.549 --> 00:19.017
- I didn't do anything.
- Except find out your wife cheated

00:19.085 --> 00:21.246
- with the guy you killed.
- I weathered your hostilities

00:21.354 --> 00:24.118
when I was with Eli, but now that
I work here, I have got to know:

00:24.224 --> 00:25.748
What the hell is your problem?

00:25.825 --> 00:29.124
I don't like who Eli became
after he started dating you.

00:29.195 --> 00:32.323
You know I've been seeing things lately.
It's crazy, huh?

00:32.399 --> 00:35.960
I can't fire you. I'm not obligated
to provide you with an office,

00:36.069 --> 00:37.900
an assistant. We're done.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.598
Looks good, Mr. Stone.

00:41.708 --> 00:45.200
Check it again, Frank. I'm telling you,
I smell a gaseous substance.

00:45.278 --> 00:49.112
Mr. Stone, it's three in the morning.
I've been standing in your apartment

00:49.182 --> 00:52.117
for the last 45 minutes
listening to you sniff.

00:52.185 --> 00:56.144
It smells like smoke.
But there's like a fishy quality to it.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.917
It's coming from the bedroom.

01:01.127 --> 01:02.389
You have to smell that.

01:02.462 --> 01:06.193
I really don't, but I'll say anything
to get back to my apartment.

01:06.933 --> 01:09.493
Maybe something died in my closet.

01:11.071 --> 01:14.131
- Did you hear that?
- No.

01:16.543 --> 01:18.443
Whoo...

01:26.486 --> 01:29.046
I like this blazer. Is it linen?

01:35.628 --> 01:36.595
What the hell?

01:36.696 --> 01:39.256
Sorry. Sorry,
there was a thing in the...

01:39.999 --> 01:42.058
- I tripped.
- OK, a word of advice?

01:42.135 --> 01:44.296
Do yourself a favor and buy a plunger.

01:44.404 --> 01:47.305
Because next time your pipes back up,
you're on your own.

01:56.583 --> 01:58.141
Eli, what are you doing?

01:58.218 --> 02:00.243
I'm just making a few adjustments.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.289
Well, you keep that up,
you're going to break your station.

02:03.389 --> 02:06.153
It's not a station, this is my office.

02:06.226 --> 02:10.185
Well, your office is tilted
to the right a bit.

02:10.295 --> 02:12.856
Here and here.

02:12.966 --> 02:17.801
If Taylor finds out you're answering
my phone and bringing me coffee...

02:17.871 --> 02:20.032
- Is that cinnamon?
- Nutmeg.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.803
Don't worry about Taylor. I'd like
to see her try and say something to me.

02:23.877 --> 02:27.108
Peter Johnson. Peter Johnson.
These are all from the same guy.

02:27.180 --> 02:30.149
Confirming and reconfirming
your lunch today.

02:30.250 --> 02:34.209
Apparently Mr. Johnson is under
the impression that you are much busier

02:34.287 --> 02:37.654
- than you actually are.
- I am busy. With scutwork.

02:37.757 --> 02:40.089
I'm like the world's
highest paid intern.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.593
Stone.

02:42.762 --> 02:47.256
If I haven't said it already, I'm sorry
about the whole aneurysm thing.

02:47.333 --> 02:50.962
Tough break, man. Does it affect
your fine motor skills?

02:51.037 --> 02:52.299
No, not really.

02:52.372 --> 02:53.669
- It's mostly...
- Good.

02:53.740 --> 02:56.675
I'm gonna need this red-lined,
proofed and duplicated.

02:56.743 --> 02:57.971
Thanks, buddy.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.710
That was a
quick trip to the file room.

03:02.782 --> 03:06.218
- Wasn't it, though?
- We should...

03:06.286 --> 03:10.620
I had another call go straight
to voicemail while you were gone.

03:10.690 --> 03:11.850
Mmm-hmm. That happens.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.826
And my schedule, Patti,
I need to know when my meetings are.

03:14.894 --> 03:18.523
You mean like the Wednesday morning
meeting that's going on right now?

03:18.598 --> 03:21.158
So hurry on. Don't be late.

03:22.635 --> 03:23.966
Was there anything else?

03:25.171 --> 03:28.038
No. I think we're good.

03:32.312 --> 03:35.281
First up, if you pay attention
to nothing else this morning

03:35.381 --> 03:38.248
pay attention to this: Arvin Solinsky.

03:40.086 --> 03:43.249
Yes, there is something about
that name that quiets the room.

03:43.323 --> 03:47.282
Due to extenuating circumstances, we're
going to need a new senior associate

03:47.393 --> 03:50.521
on the Solinsky team. You all
have the file, become experts.

03:50.597 --> 03:52.690
For one of you,
it won't be a waste of time.

03:52.765 --> 03:56.132
Next item, People v. Jayson Turk.
Mr. Dowd, Mr. Bennett,

03:56.202 --> 04:00.434
what's happening with our baseball star?
I saw ESPN covered his arraignment live.

04:00.506 --> 04:04.272
And the late night comedy shows.
Everyone's snickering at the suggestion

04:04.377 --> 04:08.074
that Jayson Turk's a murderer 'cause
he hit the ball that killed his coach.

04:08.147 --> 04:10.115
Having an affair with his wife.

04:10.216 --> 04:13.344
He's a celebrity ballplayer
who happens to be using steroids.

04:13.419 --> 04:14.716
Allegedly. As in "doesn't. "

04:14.787 --> 04:19.315
"There's no such thing as bad publicity"
doesn't apply to criminal matters.

04:19.392 --> 04:22.828
We've got a sit-down with the ADA
scheduled for this afternoon.

04:22.895 --> 04:25.125
Holy mother of God!

04:35.842 --> 04:39.209
I'm sorry. Aneurysm timeout.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.546
Sorry.

04:51.724 --> 04:54.249
Mr. Stone?

04:55.662 --> 04:57.630
Peter Johnson.

04:57.730 --> 04:58.754
Junior?

04:58.831 --> 05:01.732
Sorry, but if I told
your assistant I was 15,

05:01.801 --> 05:03.632
I don't think you would've shown up.

05:03.703 --> 05:06.171
Only because I don't practice
pediatric law.

05:06.239 --> 05:10.141
I Googled you. Big settlements. Big
judgments. You're on all the law blogs.

05:10.209 --> 05:12.473
You're exactly
the kind of lawyer I need.

05:14.547 --> 05:17.072
So what's the case?

05:17.150 --> 05:20.711
You're suing the school cafeteria to put
French fries back on the menu?

05:20.820 --> 05:26.258
My mom died. And I want to sue
the doctor who killed her.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.193
Wow. Sorry, Peter.

05:29.262 --> 05:33.596
Last year, my mom, Laura, went in
for minor surgery, hernia operation.

05:33.666 --> 05:37.432
The anesthesiologist, Dr. Agon,
never bothered to check her charts,

05:37.537 --> 05:40.472
gave her the wrong anesthesia and...

05:40.540 --> 05:44.874
They said she had a heart attack
at the table. It's all in the file.

05:45.878 --> 05:48.346
Looks like you've been to
a few lawyers already.

05:48.414 --> 05:49.642
- Six.
- Well, so you know

05:49.716 --> 05:53.345
- what I'm about to tell you.
- Malpractice is difficult to prove.

05:53.419 --> 05:54.681
What does your dad say?

05:54.754 --> 05:59.191
It was just me and my mom.
Now me and my grandma.

05:59.258 --> 06:01.886
- That's awful, Peter.
- I'm not looking for sympathy.

06:01.961 --> 06:03.929
I've got cases in the file.

06:03.996 --> 06:07.124
Seven figure settlements.
Nine, ten million dollars each.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.829
With the right lawyer behind me,
with the resources of a firm like...

06:10.903 --> 06:15.670
Well, you see, that's the thing.
I mean, my firm isn't exactly...

06:15.742 --> 06:17.903
I've been kind of demoted and...

06:18.678 --> 06:21.340
They won't let me take on
new cases right now.

06:21.414 --> 06:23.382
So, I...

06:27.220 --> 06:33.090
- "Dragon. "
- No, his name's "Agon. "

06:33.159 --> 06:38.722
I guess I should get his name right
if I'm gonna be suing him.

06:40.199 --> 06:43.066
A single mom? And she died
on the operating table?

06:43.136 --> 06:46.594
You should meet this kid.
He's all alone. It's tragic, really.

06:46.672 --> 06:49.903
It is to those of us actually
interested in helping people.

06:49.976 --> 06:51.739
I am interested in helping people.

06:51.844 --> 06:55.473
Only because you're afraid of dying
and you're trying to suck up to God.

06:55.548 --> 06:58.574
I'm sitting in a cubicle.
I don't even have my own stapler.

06:58.651 --> 07:01.017
Believe me, there are far less
humiliating ways

07:01.120 --> 07:04.783
that I could be sucking up to God.
Besides, you're perfect for this case.

07:04.857 --> 07:07.417
No one else has the heart,
the warm compassion...

07:07.493 --> 07:09.927
- Now you're sucking up to me.
- No, I'm not.

07:09.996 --> 07:12.157
We work great together.
We're like a team.

07:12.231 --> 07:16.531
Were like a team. My suggestion?
Go find yourself another peon to pee on.

07:16.602 --> 07:20.129
OK, fine. Be pissed at me,
but don't take it out on this kid.

07:20.206 --> 07:23.573
- This poor, orphaned kid.
- You are unbelievable.

07:23.676 --> 07:27.578
It's like I'm a fish and you're using
a kid and his dead mom as bait.

07:27.647 --> 07:29.012
Is it working?

07:30.283 --> 07:33.719
First year associates can't
try cases alone. It's firm policy.

07:33.786 --> 07:34.946
It's inviolate.

07:35.021 --> 07:38.582
Yes. But I wouldn't be trying
the case alone. Eli... Mr. Stone is...

07:38.658 --> 07:41.320
- Dead to me.
- And properly so, sir.

07:41.394 --> 07:45.421
But still alive enough to remain a
senior associate, at least technically,

07:45.498 --> 07:49.264
and since he can still practice law,
thanks particularly to you, sir...

07:49.335 --> 07:51.895
Flattery and judicious use of loopholes.

07:52.004 --> 07:56.498
Clearly, you know the fastest way
to my heart. Very well, have at it.

07:56.576 --> 08:00.012
With the caveat
that you will first chair.

08:00.446 --> 08:04.109
You realize that I've never first
chaired a dinner party, let alone a...

08:04.183 --> 08:06.947
Mr. Stone is on probation.
He is not to participate.

08:07.019 --> 08:11.080
If he so much as sneezes in open court,
you will be held responsible.

08:11.157 --> 08:14.649
- And by "responsible," you mean...
- I can't fire Mr. Stone.

08:14.727 --> 08:16.490
But you enjoy no such protection.

08:16.562 --> 08:20.430
Good luck with the case.
Wishing you nothing but the best.

08:34.246 --> 08:35.509
You're late.

08:35.581 --> 08:39.017
- You're wearing two different shoes.
- I am? Well, it's your fault!

08:39.085 --> 08:41.610
I'm operating on zero sleep.
I'm terrified, Eli.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.847
- Of what?
- Of losing this case!

08:43.923 --> 08:46.357
Of getting completely and totally fired.

08:46.425 --> 08:49.360
Your fiancée who's been
staring daggers at me ever since

08:49.428 --> 08:52.795
- you and I went to Hawaii together.
- On a case. Just like this one.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.992
Besides that, she's my ex-fiancée.

08:55.067 --> 08:57.695
And besides that,
the daggers, all in your head.

08:57.770 --> 09:00.500
Helpful tip: Don't ever tell a woman,

09:00.573 --> 09:03.474
particularly one who's
a senior associate on your case,

09:03.543 --> 09:05.272
that she's paranoid.

09:05.778 --> 09:08.144
Yeah, this isn't gonna get old.

09:08.247 --> 09:11.580
First thing I want you to do
is fast-track a trial date.

09:11.651 --> 09:14.677
- I did it this morning.
- Great. Excellent.

09:14.754 --> 09:18.246
Then you can get to work drafting
the subpoena for surgical records.

09:18.324 --> 09:23.159
- Pre, during, and post. Done.
- OK. Good. Good job.

09:23.329 --> 09:26.025
- Agon's assets?
- I got an intern looking into them.

09:26.098 --> 09:28.123
- What time is it?
- 9:20.

09:28.200 --> 09:31.499
OK, we have to get to a depo
at the hospital where Peter's mom died.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.734
You noticed a deposition?
Without running it past me first?

09:34.840 --> 09:37.934
- I'm lead counsel.
- You're right, with your job in danger,

09:38.010 --> 09:41.673
of course you'd want to make all
the decisions without any input from me.

09:42.715 --> 09:46.048
Well, scheduling that depo
was a smart idea. Good initiative.

09:46.118 --> 09:49.576
- OK, then, so now I'm going to...
- Borrow a pair of matching shoes,

09:49.655 --> 09:52.021
grab your notes, back here in five.

09:52.091 --> 09:53.115
OK.

09:53.192 --> 09:58.926
Guys, this has been going on too long.
Being here, this seems like a mistake.

09:58.998 --> 10:01.262
I pay you to talk to the DA
so I don't have to.

10:01.334 --> 10:04.462
You want to give Sweren some face time,
show him that respect.

10:04.537 --> 10:08.098
Respect? I did nothing wrong.
This feels like I'm looking for a favor.

10:08.174 --> 10:10.438
No, that's why we've got him
traveling to us.

10:10.509 --> 10:13.967
You're the reasonable citizen
pointing out the error of his ways.

10:14.046 --> 10:16.810
Which is why we wanted
your wife here. To show support.

10:16.882 --> 10:20.215
Well, I guess she thought she was
supportive enough by sleeping

10:20.286 --> 10:21.753
with my third-base coach.

10:21.821 --> 10:25.780
- She's kind of moved out.
- That's tough, I'm sorry.

10:25.891 --> 10:29.054
It wasn't exactly her choice
I kind of packed for her.

10:29.161 --> 10:32.927
Pragmatically, Jayson, if you guys
could reconcile that wouldn't be

10:33.032 --> 10:35.500
the worst thing, trial strategy-wise.

10:36.502 --> 10:38.561
He's kidding, right?

10:38.638 --> 10:42.369
I thought the whole idea behind meeting
with this guy was to avoid a trial.

10:42.441 --> 10:44.272
- It is.
- All I'm saying...

10:44.343 --> 10:47.176
This got messengered over
from the ADA's office.

10:47.246 --> 10:48.907
Where is the ADA?

10:50.016 --> 10:53.349
He's not coming. Put it in.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.825
I bet you a thousand bucks
you can't do that again.

11:06.899 --> 11:11.359
All right, all right.
Mikey, one right over the plate.

11:18.310 --> 11:22.440
Well, I guess we know why the ADA
didn't come to our meeting.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.881
He didn't have to.

11:26.419 --> 11:29.582
- Because of that?
- Our defense was gonna be,

11:29.655 --> 11:32.624
"Who could hit a ball accurately
enough to kill somebody?"

11:32.725 --> 11:36.217
The tape's the answer. He'll argue
it proves means and premeditation.

11:36.295 --> 11:38.855
- That was me goofing around.
- Believe me when I say

11:38.931 --> 11:42.025
it's not gonna play that way
to 12 people in a jury box.

11:42.101 --> 11:44.661
- We need to talk about options.
- Absolutely not.

11:44.737 --> 11:48.468
We're going into the court
with a straight "not guilty" defense.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.974
- Nothing less.
- Jayson...

11:50.042 --> 11:52.203
No, we're done talking. I was right.

11:52.311 --> 11:53.676
I should have stayed home.

11:53.779 --> 11:55.838
You're the lawyers, you fix this.

11:55.915 --> 11:59.248
I'm not going to court
because I hit a damn baseball.

12:05.391 --> 12:08.121
Why are you so intent
on selling out our client?

12:08.194 --> 12:11.527
I know you got a Jayson Turk lunchbox
and everything, but wake up.

12:11.597 --> 12:15.124
Killing a guy with a foul ball's
obtuse even for Wile E. Coyote.

12:15.201 --> 12:18.170
- I don't care what's on that tape.
- An opinion informed by

12:18.270 --> 12:21.205
your two and a half weeks
of criminal defense experience?

12:21.273 --> 12:23.901
He's your idol, I get it,
but all a jury's gonna see

12:23.976 --> 12:26.877
is a black man who killed the guy
who was banging his wife.

12:26.946 --> 12:29.915
The video's a smoking gun.

12:30.015 --> 12:32.381
We've got a meeting
with the judge tomorrow.

12:32.451 --> 12:34.783
If we can get
the "smoking gun" excluded,

12:34.854 --> 12:37.345
will you get behind
a straight acquittal?

12:38.124 --> 12:39.557
That's a pretty huge "if. "

12:42.795 --> 12:45.764
In your capacity as
administrator of Cypress Memorial,

12:45.831 --> 12:49.289
were you present for work
on March 26th of last year?

12:49.368 --> 12:53.429
Are you going to ask me that question
for every day of the past year?

12:53.506 --> 12:56.873
Well... I like to be thorough.

12:56.976 --> 13:01.436
Let me jump to the bottom line.
When a patient is taking

13:01.514 --> 13:03.880
migraine medication,
like Ms. Johnson was,

13:03.949 --> 13:07.885
and an anesthesiologist who pushed
opiates like Dr. Agon did,

13:07.953 --> 13:10.581
you end up with what we call
a "serotonin storm. "

13:10.656 --> 13:13.784
It's preventable and it's what
killed your client's mother.

13:13.859 --> 13:16.020
- And so you...
- Fired his ass.

13:16.128 --> 13:19.188
Then I tried to figure out
why we hired him in the first place.

13:19.265 --> 13:21.130
Why?

13:21.200 --> 13:25.364
- Is my favorite vowel.
- Agon came very highly recommended.

13:25.471 --> 13:28.907
We didn't hear any of the rumors
until after Laura Johnson's death.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.738
- What rumors?
- Negligence, malpractice,

13:31.844 --> 13:35.610
a mortality rate
15 percent higher than the norm.

13:35.681 --> 13:39.447
The truth is, St. Vincent's
unloaded this guy on us.

13:39.552 --> 13:42.783
They knew about Agon's track record
and covered it up

13:42.855 --> 13:45.517
because they were exposed
all over the place

13:45.591 --> 13:49.220
You can't blame another hospital
for malpractice committed at yours.

13:49.295 --> 13:51.661
You want to sue us, go ahead.
Shut me down.

13:51.764 --> 13:55.029
I haven't slept in three years.
Of course, you'll be depriving

13:55.100 --> 13:58.069
this community
of the only ER in 20 miles.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.637
I have a better idea.

13:59.705 --> 14:02.173
We drop our lawsuit
against your hospital.

14:02.241 --> 14:04.141
- What?
- And you retain us as counsel.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.371
Peter Johnson will be your co-plaintiff.

14:06.445 --> 14:09.312
I'm sorry, Ms. Brehe,
but he's not supposed to speak.

14:09.381 --> 14:12.509
- Who are we all suing?
- St. Vincent's.

14:12.585 --> 14:16.715
My client and your hospital both
suffered because St. Vincent's lied.

14:16.789 --> 14:20.657
I like the sound of that. I'm in.
What's our next step?

14:20.726 --> 14:25.857
I avoid getting killed by my brother.
St. Vincent's is his hospital.

14:32.905 --> 14:35.135
Dude. What the hell?

14:35.207 --> 14:37.368
- Nate, did we have?
- You sue my hospital,

14:37.476 --> 14:40.036
my place of business,
and you don't tell me first?

14:40.112 --> 14:44.674
I was going to, but then I knew that you
would get mad and there'd be yelling.

14:44.783 --> 14:46.478
And, obviously, I was wrong.

14:46.552 --> 14:49.851
- You know how I spent my morning?
- I heard that doctors like golf.

14:49.922 --> 14:52.982
In the chief of staff's office
listening to him lose his mind

14:53.058 --> 14:56.357
because some jackass is suing
our hospital for malpractice

14:56.428 --> 15:00.194
- committed at someone else's hospital!
- Aren't you overreacting?

15:00.266 --> 15:03.326
- It's not like I named you in the suit.
- That is not the point.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.563
We don't need lawyers
to keep us honest.

15:05.671 --> 15:09.437
Someone dies and no one wants to
find out what went wrong more than us.

15:09.508 --> 15:13.410
But now what we don't need is
to be dragged into court because some...

15:14.446 --> 15:16.607
Because someone
is looking to make a buck.

15:16.682 --> 15:18.946
St. Vincent's dumped this guy, Nate,

15:19.018 --> 15:22.510
and a 15-year-old kid's mom
died because of it.

15:22.588 --> 15:26.149
So you can go back and you can tell
your boss that you tried your best,

15:26.258 --> 15:30.922
but the money-grubbing ambulance chaser
you're related to couldn't be swayed.

15:38.170 --> 15:41.401
Videotape has no evidentiary value.
That's their argument?

15:41.473 --> 15:44.340
Not all videotape.
This particular videotape.

15:44.410 --> 15:47.846
Someone let the Supreme Court know
because it would be news to them.

15:47.913 --> 15:49.813
- Counsel's being an ass.
- Got an idea.

15:49.882 --> 15:52.612
Why don't we exclude
the entire baseball game

15:52.685 --> 15:55.654
during which Coach Quesada was killed?
That was on video.

15:55.721 --> 16:00.215
Mr. Bennett, you were being premature.
Now the ADA's being an ass.

16:00.292 --> 16:01.316
Your Honor?

16:01.393 --> 16:04.055
You pin your case
on anonymously sourced video.

16:04.129 --> 16:07.257
Did you really imagine there
wouldn't be a motion to exclude?

16:07.333 --> 16:10.769
No, but I didn't imagine
you'd actually grant it.

16:10.836 --> 16:14.397
I haven't granted anything yet.
But I am going to hear their argument.

16:14.473 --> 16:17.374
- Call me crazy.
- Your Honor,

16:17.443 --> 16:22.608
evidence is only admissible
if it's more reliable than prejudicial.

16:22.715 --> 16:25.878
And here it's not reliable
because it's digital.

16:25.985 --> 16:30.479
All right, all right.
Mikey, one right over the plate.

16:38.263 --> 16:41.699
You swing that lumber pretty good, Paul.
Did you play college ball?

16:41.767 --> 16:44.463
- It's a stunt.
- True, but it's a good one.

16:44.536 --> 16:48.267
Without the author of the tape,
I can't determine its reliability.

16:48.340 --> 16:51.901
The recording's out.
Defense motion granted.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.979
My name is Trevor Snyder.

16:54.046 --> 16:57.675
I am chief administrator for
St. Vincent's Hospital in San Francisco.

16:57.750 --> 17:01.311
This is a copy of the 805
health facility reporting form

17:01.420 --> 17:04.048
received by your counterpart
at Cypress Memorial,

17:04.123 --> 17:06.353
already admitted as plaintiff's B.

17:06.425 --> 17:09.053
Could you read the highlighted
paragraph out loud?

17:09.127 --> 17:12.825
"It is with great regret that
I recommend Jeffrey Agon.

17:12.897 --> 17:15.662
Regret not because
I have concerns about his ability,

17:15.733 --> 17:19.568
but because a doctor of his unassailable
record is impossible to replace. "

17:19.637 --> 17:23.665
And now could you read it
again louder?

17:26.078 --> 17:29.172
Or, instead, could you...

17:29.248 --> 17:32.217
...tell me whose signature
is at the bottom?

17:32.284 --> 17:33.581
That would be mine.

17:36.088 --> 17:38.716
And when you wrote in the letter that

17:38.791 --> 17:41.726
Dr. Agon's record was "unassailable,"
what did you mean?

17:41.794 --> 17:44.160
It meant his record
could not be attacked.

17:47.299 --> 17:51.736
Why is it that Cypress Memorial
heard nothing about the three patients

17:51.804 --> 17:53.704
who died at your hospital?

17:53.772 --> 17:56.935
Wasn't Dr. Agon the anesthesiologist
in all three surgeries?

17:57.009 --> 18:00.376
He was cleared of any wrongdoing.
Dr. Agon himself was called

18:00.446 --> 18:04.212
to account for the incident at
our Morbidity & Mortality conference.

18:04.316 --> 18:07.808
Yes, the M and M conference. I think
I'd like to see the transcript...

18:07.886 --> 18:08.853
Objection.

18:08.954 --> 18:13.118
Under evidence code 1157 peer review
conference transcripts are inadmissible.

18:13.192 --> 18:15.626
Sustained. Get at it another way.

18:17.362 --> 18:20.525
So three patients dead in two months.

18:20.599 --> 18:24.558
I guess the only explanation
would just be, what, bad luck?

18:24.636 --> 18:27.730
Those patients died in my hospital,
Ms. Dekker.

18:27.806 --> 18:31.765
On my watch. I don't appreciate what
you're implying and I don't approve

18:31.877 --> 18:34.505
of what you're doing
to my colleague's reputation.

18:34.580 --> 18:37.549
- You mean attacking his record.
- Yes.

18:37.649 --> 18:43.417
Well if I'm doing that, it's not
exactly "unassailable," is it?

18:49.628 --> 18:53.724
- How awesome was I today?
- You were awesomely awesome.

18:53.799 --> 18:58.236
You signaled it, I said it.
It was like I was inside your head.

18:58.303 --> 19:02.034
You know, I made up a little song about
first chairing. You want to hear it?

19:02.107 --> 19:05.235
Maybe later, but probably not.

19:05.310 --> 19:10.270
So we have Dr. Agon himself tomorrow.
He won't underestimate you.

19:10.349 --> 19:13.375
You have to hammer him.
He'll say "accidents happen. "

19:13.452 --> 19:15.920
He's had an above-average
number of accidents.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.479
Don't get into statistics,
the jury will tune out.

19:18.557 --> 19:20.923
Keep Peter in your eye line,
don't forget him.

19:21.026 --> 19:22.789
If you remember why you're there,

19:22.861 --> 19:24.954
- the jury will too.
- I'm sorry.

19:25.030 --> 19:28.659
And don't apologize before you've
screwed up, it's not encouraging.

19:28.734 --> 19:34.195
No, I meant
I'm sorry for how I reacted.

19:34.273 --> 19:38.767
- To your aneurysm.
- Thanks.

19:38.844 --> 19:42.678
But what does this have to do
with our case?

19:42.748 --> 19:46.878
You really care about it.
Not just about winning.

19:46.952 --> 19:49.716
You care about winning it for Peter.

19:49.788 --> 19:53.280
You're right. You're an object
of ridicule, a professional pariah,

19:53.358 --> 19:56.122
- reduced to barely practicing law.
- I feel better.

19:56.228 --> 19:58.492
If you're sucking up,
there are better ways.

19:58.564 --> 20:03.058
Well, God and I enjoy
a pretty complicated relationship.

20:03.135 --> 20:08.664
At least I'm starting to believe in
what he wants me to do.

20:10.442 --> 20:12.205
It's like I see things now, you know?

20:12.311 --> 20:15.246
Things that were always there,

20:15.314 --> 20:18.283
but that I just never noticed before.

20:19.151 --> 20:20.914
Like people who need help.

20:22.821 --> 20:26.723
Including high anxiety,
borderline competent junior associates.

20:26.792 --> 20:30.057
Well, at least I'm "borderline" now.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.203
- Uh, hey.
- Hey.

20:38.303 --> 20:41.761
- How are you?
- Good. I'm good. How are you?

20:41.840 --> 20:46.607
There's no way to ask this
without it sounding weird, but...

20:46.712 --> 20:50.648
I have a surprise that I'm sure no one
would appreciate more than you,

20:50.716 --> 20:54.948
so I was hoping you'd be free
tomorrow night?

20:55.020 --> 20:56.248
Tomorrow night.

20:56.321 --> 21:00.621
- Looking forward to it.
- Me too.

21:04.696 --> 21:10.657
Medicine's dirty little secret's that
it's not an exact science. Wish it were.

21:11.370 --> 21:15.864
So if medicine isn't an exact science,
Dr. Agon, does that mean

21:15.941 --> 21:19.468
that operational complications
are never the doctor's fault?

21:19.544 --> 21:24.481
Not "never," but in this instance I was
cleared by a thorough investigation.

21:24.549 --> 21:27.916
This "thorough investigation"
being the M and M conference

21:27.986 --> 21:29.886
which is shrouded by secrecy.

21:29.955 --> 21:32.446
- Objection.
- I would like to answer that.

21:32.524 --> 21:35.687
I petitioned the hospital
to release those transcripts.

21:35.761 --> 21:38.059
It was my reputation on the line.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.525
The hospital's pathology department

21:43.602 --> 21:46.503
attributed those deaths
to malignant hyperthermia.

21:46.571 --> 21:49.062
- What is that?
- On rare occasions,

21:49.141 --> 21:52.599
a patient will have an extreme
and fatal reaction to anesthetic.

21:52.678 --> 21:55.374
The body temperature
will spike and the heart fails.

21:55.447 --> 21:57.813
And it's completely unforeseeable.

21:57.916 --> 22:01.010
- Like... lightning.
- That's right.

22:01.086 --> 22:07.047
So, what you're saying is that
three of your patients just happened

22:07.125 --> 22:08.490
to be struck by lightning?

22:08.560 --> 22:12.724
Your metaphor belittles
the very real human tragedy here.

22:12.831 --> 22:18.133
Your admitting and OR privileges were
suspended for six months last year,

22:18.203 --> 22:20.103
- isn't that right?
- Yes.

22:20.172 --> 22:23.608
Because I was on sabbatical,
not suspension.

22:23.675 --> 22:27.634
I took six months off to finish my book,
Principles of Anesthesia,

22:27.746 --> 22:31.182
which is now being taught
in medical schools across the country.

22:34.286 --> 22:39.815
I'm sorry for your loss, son.
And more than anything in the world,

22:39.891 --> 22:41.950
I wish I could bring your mom back.

22:46.732 --> 22:49.064
Was that as big a disaster
as I think it was?

22:49.134 --> 22:51.967
No, it could have been worse.
It could still be going on.

22:52.037 --> 22:54.904
Why didn't you tell me
she was going to do the talking?

22:54.973 --> 22:57.601
- I hired you, not her.
- Well, we're a team.

22:57.676 --> 23:00.042
And we're not done fighting yet.
Either of us.

23:00.145 --> 23:02.909
Going to court was supposed
to make it better, but...

23:02.981 --> 23:05.142
I feel worse now than I did before.

23:05.217 --> 23:08.050
I'm gonna make you
a promise that I'm not supposed to.

23:08.120 --> 23:11.988
There's no amount of money that we can
win that will make up for what happened,

23:12.057 --> 23:16.756
but that's not why you're here, anyway.
You want justice, right?

23:17.963 --> 23:21.296
Well, that's the promise
I'm going to make to you.

23:21.366 --> 23:25.598
I won't stop until you get it. OK?

23:39.718 --> 23:42.949
I was just calling you.
Celebration dinner tonight.

23:43.021 --> 23:45.489
You, me and Turk. You're paying.

23:45.557 --> 23:48.492
No, I'm not because
there's nothing to celebrate.

23:48.560 --> 23:51.324
Sweren just delivered
an updated witness list.

23:51.396 --> 23:54.365
The first addition: Carly Turk.

23:54.466 --> 23:57.731
That's OK. We roll with it.
She can't hurt us.

23:57.803 --> 24:01.569
You're right. She can kill us.
She's the murderer's wife.

24:01.673 --> 24:05.109
- She has something to say?
- Calling your own client a murderer.

24:05.177 --> 24:07.941
You actually believe
he killed this guy on purpose.

24:08.046 --> 24:11.015
Understand this,
it doesn't matter what I believe.

24:11.116 --> 24:13.277
They're not going
to convict Jayson Turk.

24:13.351 --> 24:16.252
You ever even watch
a baseball game, Keith?

24:16.321 --> 24:19.256
This guy's the greatest catcher
since Johnny Bench.

24:19.324 --> 24:21.485
He's a national treasure.

24:21.560 --> 24:23.528
Open your eyes and be a lawyer.

24:23.628 --> 24:26.597
The DA believes they have
the crime of the century here.

24:26.665 --> 24:30.761
They're prosecuting a celebrity, they've
got 100,000 witnesses,

24:30.836 --> 24:34.067
and now they've got his own wife
testifying against him.

24:34.139 --> 24:37.472
It is time for us to earn our keep
and come up with a strategy beyond

24:37.542 --> 24:39.510
- "he didn't do it. "
- Even if he didn't.

24:41.680 --> 24:47.050
Ask yourself this: You want to be
his friend or keep him out of jail?

24:52.958 --> 24:55.518
- I'm glad you called.
- Really?

24:55.627 --> 24:57.993
I love surprises.

24:58.096 --> 25:00.724
At $3,000 a ticket, you better.

25:00.799 --> 25:04.326
Three thousand?
Is Jimi Hendrix playing?

25:04.402 --> 25:07.098
It's for charity and my career
took an upturn today.

25:07.172 --> 25:10.005
- I'll be able to afford it.
- What kind of upturn?

25:11.376 --> 25:14.345
- I got Solinsky.
- You...

25:18.016 --> 25:22.043
- Are you upset?
- No, I could not be happier.

25:24.956 --> 25:27.823
You seem disappointed
that I'm not disappointed.

25:27.893 --> 25:31.454
Just surprised.
And maybe a little confused.

25:31.563 --> 25:35.055
I don't know. I was prepared
for disappointed or jealous

25:35.133 --> 25:39.365
or even angry. But "couldn't be
happier" throws me a little.

25:39.437 --> 25:42.895
Well, I don't know why it should.

25:42.974 --> 25:47.536
I guess it wasn't that long ago
when you would've been upset.

25:49.681 --> 25:54.345
Well, I'm in a different place
in my life now, I guess.

25:57.122 --> 25:59.147
A different place from me.

26:05.430 --> 26:09.366
Ladies and gentlemen,
George Michael.

26:11.269 --> 26:14.033
Oh, not now. Please.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.048
Thank you so much for coming.

26:27.786 --> 26:29.083
Wait...

26:37.128 --> 26:38.686
This is incredible.

26:41.032 --> 26:43.000
Full circle.

27:16.034 --> 27:18.127
Thank you for that.

27:18.203 --> 27:20.296
I thought you might enjoy
the real thing.

27:20.372 --> 27:22.738
I thought I was never gonna
see George Michael

27:22.807 --> 27:25.173
when he wasn't standing
on my coffee table.

27:26.578 --> 27:29.046
It turned out to be
kind of appropriate, I guess.

27:29.114 --> 27:32.777
George's house call marked
the beginning of the end for us, so...

27:33.718 --> 27:35.777
- Listen, Taylor...
- So I was thinking

27:35.854 --> 27:39.017
maybe we should give each other
some breathing room at work.

27:39.124 --> 27:42.093
Steer clear. You know,
just until we get our bearings.

27:45.063 --> 27:49.124
- I'm sorry. What were you going to say?
- Same thing. You know,

27:49.200 --> 27:52.260
breathing, steer clear, bearings.

27:52.337 --> 27:56.296
But just less concisely and
with none of the right words.

28:03.481 --> 28:06.006
- Travel safe.
- You too.

28:09.788 --> 28:11.255
OK.

28:23.068 --> 28:25.036
Whoa!

28:55.133 --> 28:56.657
Nate?

29:09.514 --> 29:14.281
- You're a knight.
- It is night. It's 2:00 in the morning.

29:14.385 --> 29:17.513
You know something. You're supposed
to help me. I had a vision.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.557
You mean another episode.

29:20.558 --> 29:22.583
OK.

29:22.660 --> 29:26.221
So I sued your hospital because
I was getting fly-bys from a dragon,

29:26.331 --> 29:29.858
and now I'm getting nearly trampled
to death by a knight on a horse.

29:29.934 --> 29:31.595
Nate, the knight was you.

29:31.669 --> 29:35.105
An hour ago, you were chasing a dragon
down Foster Street on horseback.

29:35.173 --> 29:37.641
An hour ago, I was here. Asleep.

29:37.709 --> 29:40.473
And my horse
hasn't been ridden all night.

29:40.545 --> 29:41.842
Can I please go to bed now?

29:41.913 --> 29:45.246
My client's mother was killed
by Dr. Agon's malpractice.

29:45.316 --> 29:48.649
Dr. Agon. D-R-Agon. Dragon.

29:49.487 --> 29:51.216
Knights slay dragons, Nate.

29:51.289 --> 29:53.849
Do you have any idea
how delusional you sound?

29:53.958 --> 29:57.257
I mean it's like watching Charles Manson
on the Wheel of Fortune.

29:57.328 --> 30:00.263
How did I know your patient
was going to die last month?

30:00.331 --> 30:03.095
Or about the song you and Dad
sang on the fishing trip?

30:03.168 --> 30:05.466
- You believed me.
- I believed that they were

30:05.537 --> 30:09.234
massive coincidences
that totally blew my mind, yeah.

30:09.307 --> 30:11.571
I was hammered at the time
so if you had told me

30:11.643 --> 30:14.771
I had an arm growing out
of my forehead, I'd have believed you.

30:14.846 --> 30:18.009
You know something about my case.
Now what is it?

30:19.551 --> 30:23.612
- You were at Agon's M and M conference.
- The confidential proceeding

30:23.688 --> 30:26.748
that I can't talk about even
if I was there? That conference?

30:26.825 --> 30:28.258
I need to know what was said.

30:28.326 --> 30:29.793
- You can tell me.
- I can't.

30:29.861 --> 30:32.989
That's what "privileged" means.
As a lawyer you'd know that.

30:33.064 --> 30:38.127
- Were you part of the cover-up?
- No. God, no.

30:38.203 --> 30:41.969
And, yeah, I thought the guy
was incompetent.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.975
One of the nurses called him
a "lawsuit in scrubs,"

30:45.043 --> 30:47.807
but I had no idea
that they had lied about his record.

30:47.879 --> 30:50.575
It doesn't matter,
there is no judge in the universe

30:50.648 --> 30:53.139
who will allow me to testify
about what was said.

30:53.218 --> 30:56.449
You're right.
But you just helped me anyway.

31:01.459 --> 31:03.518
You understand
you're under oath.

31:03.595 --> 31:05.222
I do.

31:05.797 --> 31:10.825
Mr. Snyder, you testified that Dr. Agon
had resigned from your hospital,

31:10.902 --> 31:13.564
- that you didn't fire him.
- Yes. That is right.

31:13.638 --> 31:15.367
Is that clear enough this time?

31:15.440 --> 31:18.204
And just before Dr. Agon resigned,

31:18.276 --> 31:21.643
he lost a patient,
a man named Eric Shelby.

31:21.746 --> 31:23.407
And by "lost" I mean killed.

31:23.481 --> 31:27.542
Dr. Agon didn't kill anyone. He was
cleared of malfeasance or negligence.

31:27.619 --> 31:30.588
At your hospital's
Morbidity and Mortality conference.

31:30.655 --> 31:33.818
Specifically, the one held
August 11, 2006?

31:33.925 --> 31:38.419
Objection. Ms. Dekker's forgotten what's
said in these conferences is privileged.

31:38.496 --> 31:41.192
I haven't asked him
what was said at the conference.

31:41.266 --> 31:45.032
Stay on the right side of that line,
counsel. Objection overruled.

31:45.136 --> 31:47.764
Are notes taken
at these M and M conferences?

31:47.839 --> 31:51.275
Specifically the August 11th conference?

31:53.244 --> 31:57.340
Yes. There is always a stenographer
present. We take detailed notes,

31:57.415 --> 31:59.178
- but...
- Don't those notes

31:59.250 --> 32:03.118
reflect testimony establishing
significant negligence

32:03.187 --> 32:04.347
on the part of Dr. Agon?

32:04.422 --> 32:07.118
Did his nurse describe him
as a "lawsuit in scrubs"?

32:07.191 --> 32:09.091
- Those are privileged!
- Is that a yes?

32:09.160 --> 32:12.618
Objection. Counsel hasn't produced
these transcripts to the defense.

32:12.697 --> 32:15.666
I haven't introduced
any transcripts... yet.

32:15.767 --> 32:19.134
Objection overruled.
Answer the question.

32:19.203 --> 32:23.264
Was there significant negligence?

32:24.842 --> 32:26.002
Yes.

32:27.378 --> 32:29.812
And one last thing.

32:29.881 --> 32:34.250
If Dr. Agon hadn't resigned,
you were going to fire him, correct?

32:35.219 --> 32:36.379
Yes.

32:38.056 --> 32:40.820
That might be something
his next employer

32:40.892 --> 32:45.386
deserved to know, don't you think?

32:46.798 --> 32:49.164
Five hundred thousand,
exchange of releases,

32:49.267 --> 32:52.395
- and a confidentiality agreement.
- Five hundred thousand?

32:52.470 --> 32:56.634
That's... insulting. I'm insulted.

32:56.741 --> 32:58.766
I'm advising my clients to be insulted.

32:58.843 --> 33:02.006
The malpractice wasn't committed
at my client's hospital.

33:02.113 --> 33:05.674
After what happened, I'm not sure
the jury cares, but maybe I'm wrong.

33:05.750 --> 33:09.413
One-point-one. I don't have board
authorization to go any higher.

33:12.390 --> 33:15.325
Too bad, because you're going
to have to go higher.

33:15.393 --> 33:17.554
One-point-five. Firm.
Take it or leave it.

33:17.662 --> 33:20.529
- I think we'll... take it.
- Take it.

33:20.598 --> 33:24.659
- We'll take it.
- No. It's not enough.

33:24.736 --> 33:26.704
Could we have the room, please?

33:34.545 --> 33:37.480
You promised. This isn't justice.

33:37.548 --> 33:40.312
One point five million
is a lot of justice, Peter.

33:40.418 --> 33:42.978
You were right, money
won't bring my mom back.

33:43.087 --> 33:45.612
I want someone to say
that what they did was wrong.

33:47.425 --> 33:50.724
I can't promise you that.
No lawyer can.

33:50.795 --> 33:52.820
I don't know what
the jury's going to do.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.697
I guess...

33:58.770 --> 33:59.998
I need to find out.

34:06.444 --> 34:11.210
All right, Peter. If that's what
you want to do then we'll do it.

34:11.849 --> 34:15.341
I am so sorry, Tom. No, no.
No, it won't happen again.

34:15.420 --> 34:17.581
I promise... Hello?

34:20.925 --> 34:22.255
Patti!

34:23.761 --> 34:25.319
Patti.

34:28.199 --> 34:31.862
I just got off the phone with
Tom Brevoort from Chaykin Technologies.

34:31.936 --> 34:33.904
A call, I might add, I picked up myself.

34:33.971 --> 34:38.067
And he was furious that I hadn't
returned his five previous phone calls.

34:38.141 --> 34:40.975
I'm sorry. I can't imagine
what could've happened.

34:41.045 --> 34:43.478
I know you think I'm
the Wicked Witch of the West...

34:43.547 --> 34:47.210
East. She was worse.
They dropped a house on her.

34:47.284 --> 34:49.253
But I am your boss now, Patti.

34:49.320 --> 34:52.687
You are on my desk, which means
you have a choice to make.

34:52.790 --> 34:57.853
I get a choice? Really?
Well, it's been nice working with you.

34:57.929 --> 35:02.866
No, Patti. You have a choice
between working at this firm or not.

35:02.934 --> 35:07.462
When Eli was demoted, they were
going to let you go. I intervened.

35:07.538 --> 35:10.507
Eli loves you and so I wanted
to protect you because of that.

35:10.608 --> 35:14.100
So here's the thing.
This is entirely in your hands.

35:14.178 --> 35:15.941
You decide how this plays out.

35:16.047 --> 35:19.414
Because after this last week,
I've got to be honest with you,

35:19.517 --> 35:21.610
either way is fine with me.

35:21.686 --> 35:24.314
Has the jury reached a verdict?

35:24.388 --> 35:27.516
We have. In the matter
of Peter Johnson and Cypress Memorial v.

35:27.592 --> 35:30.618
St. Vincent's Hospital,
we find in favor of the plaintiffs

35:30.695 --> 35:35.155
and award compensatory damages
in the amount of $28,000.

35:35.233 --> 35:38.930
Because of the institutionalized fraud
on the part of St. Vincent's,

35:39.003 --> 35:43.303
we further award punitive damages
in the amount of $8 million.

35:55.019 --> 35:57.681
Wow. Wow.

35:57.755 --> 36:00.519
Eight million is... Wow.

36:00.625 --> 36:02.957
You have to split that
with Cypress Memorial.

36:03.027 --> 36:05.860
Ms. Brehe said she was going
to name a wing after my mom.

36:05.930 --> 36:07.090
That's cool, right?

36:07.165 --> 36:10.828
Seven lawyers later,
I'm glad you hung in there.

36:10.902 --> 36:12.130
Your mom would be proud.

36:12.203 --> 36:14.967
Thank you so much. OK, bye.

36:17.842 --> 36:19.867
Congratulations, counselor.

36:35.126 --> 36:39.062
- I have to go kill myself. Goodbye.
- Maggie, it's only weird if we...

36:39.130 --> 36:41.792
If this is how she reacts
when she wins a case,

36:41.866 --> 36:44.027
I do not want to be here
when she loses.

36:44.101 --> 36:47.264
No, it's not about the case.
She's just...

36:47.338 --> 36:48.703
You don't want to know.

36:48.773 --> 36:53.938
Even if I did, my boss wouldn't
approve of me wasting my time.

36:54.045 --> 36:57.071
Speaking of which,
have you seen Ms. Wethersby?

36:57.148 --> 36:59.582
- "Ms. Wethersby?"
- Yes.

36:59.650 --> 37:03.677
Jordan wants to see her in his office.
Apparently you too.

37:03.754 --> 37:09.693
- The day started off so well.
- Life is full of disappointment, Eli.

37:11.462 --> 37:12.690
Are you all right?

37:14.265 --> 37:16.426
Yeah, it's just...

37:17.134 --> 37:20.399
It's no fun anymore.

37:20.471 --> 37:23.907
Well, I guess that's why
they call it work.

37:23.975 --> 37:26.739
Never used to feel like it.

37:28.045 --> 37:31.276
- Patti?
- Taylor Wethersby's office.

37:31.349 --> 37:34.876
No, she isn't. May I take a message?

37:37.188 --> 37:40.919
Temporary insanity?
Are you kidding me?

37:40.992 --> 37:44.428
- It's still a not guilty plea.
- Yeah, not guilty because I'm crazy!

37:44.495 --> 37:47.726
What happened to not guilty
'cause I'm not guilty?

37:47.798 --> 37:50.892
- Your wife happened.
- I thought wives couldn't testify.

37:50.968 --> 37:54.734
We tell you your wife's cooperating
with the DA, and that's your response?

37:54.839 --> 37:57.307
What other kind of response
are you looking for?

37:57.375 --> 38:00.139
"She couldn't possibly have
anything to tell the DA.

38:00.211 --> 38:02.372
I never threatened him. "
That'd be nice.

38:02.446 --> 38:05.540
He was screwing my wife.
I threatened him, but I didn't kill him.

38:05.616 --> 38:08.346
- That's the way it looks.
- I don't care how it looks.

38:08.419 --> 38:10.887
Look, we're not your entourage, OK?

38:10.955 --> 38:14.982
You pay us to tell you what you
need to hear, not what you want to.

38:15.059 --> 38:18.153
This will work.
The law says you're not guilty

38:18.229 --> 38:21.665
if you weren't in your right mind.
Steroids have that effect.

38:21.732 --> 38:25.259
I told you, I don't do that crap.

38:25.336 --> 38:28.396
Bottom line,
you admit to the steroid use,

38:28.472 --> 38:30.838
we can protect you on the murder charge.

38:38.215 --> 38:39.477
You agree with him?

38:39.550 --> 38:42.713
Jayson, listen to me, man:

38:42.820 --> 38:46.916
The day I passed the Bar,
you hit for the cycle against Detroit.

38:46.991 --> 38:51.325
The day I joined this firm,
you caught Balderrama's no-hitter.

38:51.395 --> 38:55.092
I can chart my entire adult life
by the things you did in yours.

38:55.166 --> 39:00.035
Now I'm telling you I'm not so sure
you weren't aiming for your coach,

39:00.104 --> 39:02.470
and I'm your biggest fan.

39:02.540 --> 39:06.806
So you tell me,
what's a jury gonna think?

39:06.877 --> 39:11.143
If I say I'm juicing, that's it.
They'll kick me out of the league.

39:11.215 --> 39:13.183
My sponsors, The Hall of Fame...

39:13.284 --> 39:15.718
We're talking about your life here.

39:16.754 --> 39:20.281
Baseball is my life.

39:23.494 --> 39:25.155
I'll think about it.

39:30.701 --> 39:32.726
You're not fooling anyone, Mr. Stone.

39:32.803 --> 39:35.135
Though Ms. Dekker
was the attorney of record,

39:35.206 --> 39:39.734
courthouse insiders have figured out
who truly deserves the credit

39:39.810 --> 39:42.540
for this afternoon's victory
in the St. Vincent's case.

39:42.613 --> 39:45.776
- I didn't do anything special.
- This changes nothing between us.

39:45.883 --> 39:49.717
I mention the courthouse gossip because
it reached the ears of Arvin Solinsky.

39:49.787 --> 39:53.416
Our high profile client feels
he needs a high profile attorney

39:53.491 --> 39:56.051
and, like it or not,
Eli's profile keeps...

39:56.127 --> 39:58.618
- Getting higher.
- Solinsky doesn't need me.

39:58.696 --> 40:00.323
Taylor's a far better choice.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.764
Believe me, I made that case,
but he wants you.

40:02.833 --> 40:06.098
And regardless of what he wants,
it'd be malpractice to entrust

40:06.170 --> 40:08.502
the case solely to you.

40:08.572 --> 40:11.132
- Taylor, you'll stay on as co-counsel.
- What?

40:11.242 --> 40:13.870
I recognize that the timing
is not ideal, but...

40:13.944 --> 40:16.845
Sir, you have to tell Solinsky
that I'm unavailable.

40:16.914 --> 40:19.212
Tell him anything.
Tell him I got hit by a bus.

40:19.283 --> 40:22.116
Even if I got to drive it,
I couldn't do that.

40:22.186 --> 40:25.019
The firm can't afford to lose Solinsky.

40:25.089 --> 40:28.388
Make no mistake, by the end,
you will be on the Solinsky case.

40:28.459 --> 40:30.586
So let's jump to the end
of this meeting.

40:30.661 --> 40:34.290
What is it you're looking for here?
Some of your privileges back?

40:34.365 --> 40:36.458
Your expense account?
Your company car?

40:36.534 --> 40:38.900
- Your old office?
- I don't want my office back.

40:39.003 --> 40:43.167
You have the right person in there.
All I want is four walls and a door.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.242
- No more cubicles.
- Done.

40:46.844 --> 40:48.471
And one more thing.

40:48.546 --> 40:51.071
Eli Stone's office, please hold.

40:51.148 --> 40:52.615
- Hi.
- Hello, sweetie.

40:52.683 --> 40:56.414
- I'm here to see Mr. Stone?
- Right this way.

41:03.127 --> 41:07.359
- Mr. Johnson's here.
- Hey.

41:07.431 --> 41:10.298
Nice office. It's unorthodox.

41:10.367 --> 41:13.268
Well, kind of goes with my practice.

41:15.439 --> 41:16.929
Is everything OK?

41:17.007 --> 41:19.703
The school cafeteria
took French fries off the menu,

41:19.777 --> 41:21.608
so I'm thinking about suing.

41:24.081 --> 41:26.709
My grandma told me I need
to bring you a thank you gift,

41:26.784 --> 41:30.550
and the check hasn't cleared yet.
So I thought, maybe,

41:30.654 --> 41:32.144
I'd give you something else.

41:37.127 --> 41:40.358
My mom used to read this to me
all the time when I was little.

41:41.799 --> 41:46.429
I know it's weird,
giving you a book, but...

41:46.504 --> 41:48.529
...it means a lot to me.

41:57.548 --> 42:00.711
Peter, this is the biggest fee
I ever got.

42:00.784 --> 42:03.912
Wait until the two million dollar
check clears.

42:04.655 --> 42:06.122
Anyway...

42:10.528 --> 42:12.826
Thanks again, Mr. Stone.

42:15.866 --> 42:17.094
Bye.
