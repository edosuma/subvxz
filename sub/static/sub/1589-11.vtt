00:01.160 --> 00:03.025
ANNOUNCER: Previously on
Pretty Little Liars

00:03.130 --> 00:04.597
I don't know what happened
to you when you were away.

00:04.700 --> 00:06.031
That's right.

00:06.140 --> 00:07.232
You don't know
the first thing about it.

00:07.340 --> 00:08.432
I'm not gonna
allow you

00:08.540 --> 00:10.360
to jump back
on Ali's crazy train.

00:10.470 --> 00:12.631
Not with Tanner circling and
"A" watching our every move.

00:12.740 --> 00:14.605
What we should be doing
is burning this stuff.

00:14.710 --> 00:16.473
Emily, Ali is not
our friend right now.

00:16.580 --> 00:18.605
Ali's not the problem,
Spencen

00:18.710 --> 00:20.018
Melissa is.

00:20.150 --> 00:21.674
We both know All
wasn't kidnapped.

00:21.820 --> 00:24.448
Sooner or later, she's
gonna get what she deserves.

00:24.550 --> 00:26.689
We go to Tanner
and we tell her the truth.

00:26.820 --> 00:28.014
What about New York?

00:28.120 --> 00:29.280
We can't just
come half clean.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.057
It was self-defense
and you were protecting us.

00:31.160 --> 00:32.127
I have a plan.

00:32.230 --> 00:33.299
EMILY: Oh, I'm sure you do.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.458
The problem is
you'll throw us

00:34.560 --> 00:36.164
all under a bus
just to pull it off.

00:36.300 --> 00:37.460
We need to cut
ties with Ali now.

00:37.570 --> 00:38.719
Tonight.

00:46.180 --> 00:47.306
( sighs )

00:47.440 --> 00:49.374
Seems to me we've
been here before.

00:49.480 --> 00:51.744
We'll get it
right this time.

00:51.850 --> 00:53.579
This time is different.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.211
After this,
Ali's on her own.

01:03.190 --> 01:04.555
Wait.

01:11.670 --> 01:13.467
That's When All came
to my hospital room

01:13.570 --> 01:14.594
after Mona's party.

01:17.910 --> 01:19.172
( beeping )

01:24.580 --> 01:25.740
We can't tell now.

01:25.880 --> 01:27.074
Why not?

01:27.180 --> 01:28.738
Because no one
WIII believe

01:28.880 --> 01:30.745
we didn't know All
was alive if they see this.

01:35.390 --> 01:36.322
Hey, you can't!

01:36.430 --> 01:37.624
HANNA: It won't do any good!

01:37.760 --> 01:40.627
Spencer,
put down the brick.

01:40.760 --> 01:41.795
Put it down.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.785
* Got a secret,
can you keep it? *

02:04.920 --> 02:07.388
* Swear this one
you'll save *

02:07.520 --> 02:09.784
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

02:09.930 --> 02:12.490
* Taking this one
to the grave *

02:12.600 --> 02:14.625
* If I show you
then I know *

02:14.730 --> 02:17.528
* You won't tell
what I saId *

02:17.670 --> 02:19.888
* 'Cause two can
keep a secret *

02:20.000 --> 02:22.434
* If one
of them is dead *

02:32.820 --> 02:35.846
Hanna went to go check on
Caleb and Aria went home.

02:35.950 --> 02:37.178
Here.

02:38.290 --> 02:39.712
I can't drink
coffee right now.

02:39.820 --> 02:40.889
Oh, it's decaf.

02:40.990 --> 02:42.651
I bought it
for the whipped cream.

02:43.890 --> 02:46.427
Are you feeling
better?

02:46.530 --> 02:50.318
Not better,
less stupid.

02:50.430 --> 02:51.692
Thank you
for stopping me.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.631
Saveit
for a real target.

02:53.740 --> 02:56.436
What, "A" in the flesh?

02:56.540 --> 02:58.303
That's one candidate.

02:58.410 --> 03:00.833
What are you thinking?

03:00.940 --> 03:03.408
"We're all
in this together."

03:03.510 --> 03:06.673
I mean
that could be "A" or...

03:08.320 --> 03:09.639
it could be Alison.

03:11.990 --> 03:14.811
Or "A" wanting us
to think it's Alison.

03:14.920 --> 03:17.957
( cell phone rings )

03:18.060 --> 03:19.550
It's Alison.

03:19.660 --> 03:21.855
Are you going
to answer?

03:22.000 --> 03:24.662
I think we need to hit
the mute button for right now.

03:28.470 --> 03:29.505
Hey, how are you?

03:31.440 --> 03:33.476
You are the one who held
in there the longest with her.

03:35.440 --> 03:37.601
I wasn't
defending Ali.

03:37.710 --> 03:40.349
I was defending somebody
from a long time ago.

03:41.450 --> 03:43.816
Maybe somebody
who never existed.

03:43.920 --> 03:47.959
God, the thing I had
with Paige was so genuine.

03:48.060 --> 03:50.381
Now...

03:50.490 --> 03:52.799
Can you fix it?

03:52.900 --> 03:54.549
Sure, yeah.

03:54.660 --> 03:56.389
I can go up to Paige and say,
"So you were right all along.

03:56.500 --> 03:57.421
My bad.

03:57.530 --> 03:58.497
Let's kiss
and make-up."

03:58.600 --> 04:01.569
( cell phone buzzes )

04:01.670 --> 04:02.898
It's Ali.

04:03.040 --> 04:04.507
Maybe she's looking
for us.

04:04.640 --> 04:05.766
She must be nervous.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.599
Not as nervous
as her dad.

04:07.710 --> 04:08.734
He's taking her
out of town.

04:08.840 --> 04:11.604
He's worried about
the kidnapper.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.871
Ali's luclq that they
released him when they did.

04:15.650 --> 04:16.912
Yeah...

04:17.020 --> 04:20.410
real lucky.

04:20.520 --> 04:23.023
Don't play with
your comfort food.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.302
Jeez, you scared
the hell out of me.

04:46.550 --> 04:47.949
What is this?

04:49.080 --> 04:50.286
Nothing.

04:53.520 --> 04:54.555
I thought we had a deal.

04:54.660 --> 04:56.685
It wasn't so much
a deal, okay?

04:56.790 --> 04:58.485
It was more like
an understanding.

04:58.590 --> 04:59.796
Yeah, that we would
stop drinking.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.460
It helps me when
I can't sleep, okay?

05:04.400 --> 05:05.560
Why can't you sleep?

05:07.840 --> 05:09.762
What happened
with the police?

05:09.870 --> 05:11.633
We never made it.

05:11.740 --> 05:13.298
Why not?

05:13.410 --> 05:15.002
Because "A" chopped us off
at the ankles, that's why not.

05:15.110 --> 05:17.908
And look, we can't be telling
people we haven't seen Alison

05:18.010 --> 05:20.376
when there are pictures of her
leaving my hospital room

05:20.480 --> 05:21.378
when she was
supposed to be dead.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.812
"A" has those pictures?

05:23.920 --> 05:26.480
We're back
where we started.

05:27.860 --> 05:30.021
We always end up back
where we started.

05:31.590 --> 05:33.455
Go ahead.

05:33.560 --> 05:34.754
I won't stop you.

05:40.500 --> 05:41.865
( knocking on door)

05:51.510 --> 05:52.545
Can I talk to you?

05:54.150 --> 05:56.072
MONA: Everything about
the Manhattan Project is fun.

05:56.180 --> 05:57.738
It's the place where
the Cold War started.

05:57.890 --> 05:59.858
And J. Robert Oppenheimer
is dreamy.

06:01.560 --> 06:02.754
I don't think I can
put that in the report.

06:02.890 --> 06:03.925
Hello.

06:05.860 --> 06:07.020
Hey.
Hello.

06:08.460 --> 06:11.520
Want some more
hot chocolate, Mr. Mike?

06:11.630 --> 06:13.530
Uh, sure.

06:13.640 --> 06:14.937
How about you?

06:15.040 --> 06:16.701
No, thanks.

06:24.110 --> 06:25.771
How could she
identify a kidnapper

06:25.910 --> 06:27.013
when she was
never kidnapped?

06:27.120 --> 06:29.486
She knew him
from when she was on her own.

06:29.590 --> 06:32.514
The name he gave
the police was Cyrus Petrillo.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.412
Have you ever
heard that name,

06:34.520 --> 06:36.886
in all the time you
were doing your research?

06:36.990 --> 06:40.027
Uh, no, I don't have much
from when she was gone.

06:40.130 --> 06:41.757
It's a blank.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.964
But why would this guy confess
to a crime he didn't commit?

06:44.070 --> 06:46.937
Maybe he knew it
wouldn't stick.

06:47.070 --> 06:48.469
Maybe he knew Ali
wouldn't confirm

06:48.570 --> 06:49.764
the story until
it was too late.

06:49.870 --> 06:51.007
Yeah, but
if you're this guy,

06:51.110 --> 06:52.532
why would you even
take that chance?

06:54.580 --> 06:57.469
Because somebody has something
worse to use against you.

07:02.550 --> 07:03.847
Have you seen
this before?

07:03.950 --> 07:04.848
No.

07:04.950 --> 07:06.178
Where did you get this?

07:06.290 --> 07:07.882
A friend of a friend.

07:07.990 --> 07:10.083
I'll see what I can
find out about Cyrus.

07:10.230 --> 07:11.652
Thanks.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.695
Thanks for trusting me.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.097
You're the only one

07:18.200 --> 07:20.088
who might be able to help me
get the answers that I need.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.696
I have to trust you.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.859
Well then, thank you
for your honesty.

07:30.710 --> 07:31.745
You need anything?

07:33.150 --> 07:34.117
I'm okay.

07:34.220 --> 07:35.642
Well,
Mike took Mona home.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.985
Dad.

07:39.120 --> 07:41.008
Mike and Mona
is a very bad idea.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.953
Well, he likes her
and she seems to like him.

07:44.060 --> 07:45.129
"Seems to."

07:46.860 --> 07:48.623
I understand
that you and Mona

07:48.730 --> 07:51.893
have more than
the usual amount of history,

07:52.000 --> 07:53.160
but you know
what'll happen

07:53.270 --> 07:54.191
if either one of us
tries to talk to Mike.

07:54.300 --> 07:55.858
Yep, he'll double-down.

07:55.970 --> 08:00.009
So I suggest we keep
an eye on the situation,

08:00.140 --> 08:02.074
but keep our distance.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.672
I'll try.

08:04.780 --> 08:06.145
Okay.

08:06.280 --> 08:09.044
Oh, your mom is coming back
from Scranton in the morning.

08:09.150 --> 08:11.015
And we have those tickets
for tomorrow night.

08:11.150 --> 08:14.756
I had my fedora re-blocked
for the occasion.

08:14.890 --> 08:16.050
Just the four of us.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.025
It's been a long time
since we've done that.

08:19.560 --> 08:20.754
Too long.

08:30.910 --> 08:32.878
Your brother deserves
way better than Mona.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.732
Boys hate it when you
question their judgment.

08:34.840 --> 08:37.172
If I try to tell Mike that Mona
isn't what he's looking for--

08:37.310 --> 08:39.642
You won't be able to
separate them With a crowbar.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.748
Colorful, Em.

08:41.850 --> 08:43.044
Graphic,
but colorful.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.841
You guys,
I had a bad thought.

08:45.950 --> 08:46.848
Well, why should you
be any different?

08:46.960 --> 08:48.257
Share.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.055
"A" doesn't want us _
telling the truth about All

08:50.160 --> 08:51.650
because they like
to see us suffer.

08:51.760 --> 08:52.988
Not new information.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.557
But who besides "A"
wants to keep us quiet?

08:55.660 --> 08:56.968
Are you thinking about
somebody in particular?

08:57.070 --> 08:57.991
Mona.

08:58.100 --> 08:59.294
Not Mona.

08:59.400 --> 09:00.833
Who's left?

09:00.940 --> 09:03.033
Alison.

09:03.140 --> 09:05.199
That is a bad thought.

09:05.310 --> 09:07.130
( bell rings )

09:07.240 --> 09:08.172
I got to go.

09:08.280 --> 09:09.838
Me, too.
Later.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.240
Hey, wait a second.

09:12.350 --> 09:13.749
Is this
another bad thought?

09:13.850 --> 09:16.068
Do you still talk
to that guy Dean?

09:16.180 --> 09:17.943
My sober-coach?

09:18.050 --> 09:19.608
Not since
my mom fired him.

09:19.720 --> 09:20.687
Why?

09:20.820 --> 09:22.082
Well, do you
have his number?

09:23.190 --> 09:24.885
It's not for me,
it's for Caleb.

09:24.990 --> 09:26.127
What's wrong?

09:26.230 --> 09:28.198
I don't know
and he won't tell me.

09:28.300 --> 09:30.165
Is this
about his drinking?

09:30.270 --> 09:31.897
Part of it.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.833
You can't just introduce Caleb
to a total stranger and say,

09:34.940 --> 09:36.066
"Let's talk
about addiction."

09:36.170 --> 09:38.604
Spencer, I have
to do something.

09:40.240 --> 09:42.299
I think there's somebody
better for him to talk to.

09:45.180 --> 09:48.308
Sydney may be a liar, but
she's a damn good swimmer.

09:48.420 --> 09:49.717
I liked having her
on the team.

09:49.850 --> 09:51.647
She still is on the team.

09:51.750 --> 09:54.753
That way we can
keep an eye on her.

09:54.860 --> 09:57.852
How does it feel, being
back in the locker room?

10:00.000 --> 10:03.026
Feels good.

10:03.130 --> 10:05.769
Seems like the only place
I see you is at practice.

10:05.870 --> 10:06.996
I know.

10:07.100 --> 10:08.636
It's...

10:08.740 --> 10:10.059
Complicated.

10:13.710 --> 10:16.599
Paige, we need to talk.

10:16.710 --> 10:17.972
Maybe tonight?

10:18.080 --> 10:22.881
I've got something tonight,
but, yeah, we should talk.

10:24.150 --> 10:25.048
Okay.

10:25.150 --> 10:26.754
Okay.

10:42.240 --> 10:45.937
Do I call you Officer Toby
or Cadet Toby?

10:46.040 --> 10:47.302
I like Cadet.

10:47.440 --> 10:49.908
Sounds like you're
in Space Command.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.403
( chuckles )

10:51.510 --> 10:53.819
Um, can you come over?

10:53.920 --> 10:56.787
I need to talk to you.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.846
No, it's about Caleb.

11:01.060 --> 11:03.654
It will be easier
If you're here.

11:03.790 --> 11:06.327
It's always easier
when you're here.

11:06.430 --> 11:07.351
Thanks, Toby.

11:07.460 --> 11:08.791
Bye.

11:11.230 --> 11:12.322
Are you sure about this?

11:12.430 --> 11:13.897
Caleb will listen to him.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.230
Never underestimate
the power of a good bromance.

11:18.210 --> 11:19.234
Spence.

11:23.080 --> 11:24.809
It's from Melissa.

11:24.910 --> 11:25.979
I'd recognize that

11:26.080 --> 11:27.115
anal-retentive
handwriting aanhere.

11:30.220 --> 11:31.414
Melissa!

11:32.920 --> 11:33.818
What is it?

11:33.960 --> 11:35.757
Melissa's gone.

11:35.860 --> 11:36.849
Where'd she go?

11:36.960 --> 11:37.984
"I have to write
this quickly.

11:38.090 --> 11:39.057
Dad's taking me
to the airport.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.297
I'm sorry.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.958
You'll know everything soon.
I promise."

11:42.100 --> 11:44.864
Why would your dad
make her leave?

11:44.970 --> 11:47.689
I don't know.

11:51.510 --> 11:54.001
The note said that Spencer
should know everything soon.

11:54.110 --> 11:55.236
What does
that mean?

11:55.380 --> 11:57.143
_ It means what
It always means.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.104
Nobody tells you anything
when you want to know it,

11:59.210 --> 12:00.711
only when they feel
like telling it.

12:00.820 --> 12:01.946
And then they only
tell you enough

12:02.050 --> 12:03.312
to make you crazy
to know more.

12:03.420 --> 12:05.240
Has anyone
talked to Ali?

12:05.350 --> 12:06.988
She calls,
but I don't pick up.

12:07.090 --> 12:08.853
You guys,
I had a bad thought.

12:08.990 --> 12:11.481
I'm sorry, they just keep
showing up in my head.

12:11.590 --> 12:12.852
What's this one?

12:14.100 --> 12:16.398
A" left town,
but "A" said she couldn't.

12:16.530 --> 12:17.792
What changed?

12:17.900 --> 12:20.266
Well, Ali made
a deal with Noel.

12:20.370 --> 12:23.009
Maybe she made a deal
with somebody else?

12:23.140 --> 12:25.734
You're thinking she made
a deal with "A" to leave town?

12:25.870 --> 12:26.939
What kind of deal?

12:28.110 --> 12:29.998
TANNER: Hello, girls.

12:30.110 --> 12:32.249
Luclq to get most
of you at the same time.

12:32.350 --> 12:34.773
I was hoping
we could talk.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.017
My treat.

12:44.290 --> 12:47.123
You're going to make
an excellent authority figure.

12:52.170 --> 12:54.866
Where is everybody?

12:54.970 --> 12:57.336
My mom is taking
marathon depositions

12:57.440 --> 12:59.761
and my dad
is staying at his club,

12:59.910 --> 13:04.279
which was something I only
thought men did in old movies.

13:04.380 --> 13:07.110
And Melissa?

13:07.220 --> 13:10.109
I don't know, she may
be back in Europe.

13:10.220 --> 13:12.415
She may be
at the Edgewood Motor Court.

13:12.520 --> 13:15.284
The only thing I know for sure
is that she isn't here.

13:17.360 --> 13:21.854
Hey, when was the last
time you saw Caleb?

13:21.960 --> 13:23.268
Um...

13:23.370 --> 13:27.488
Couple of nights after
my house blew up.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.865
I checked at the cabin to see
if he needed anything.

13:30.970 --> 13:32.369
How did he seem to you?

13:34.540 --> 13:36.474
Why don't you
tell me?

13:38.950 --> 13:41.874
Hanna stopped drinking,
but he hasn't.

13:41.980 --> 13:43.186
He says
it helps him sleep.

13:43.290 --> 13:44.917
Maybe it does.

13:45.020 --> 13:46.214
I think there's more
to it than that.

13:46.350 --> 13:48.557
You think
or Hanna thinks?

13:48.660 --> 13:50.423
He's different.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.829
Not in big ways,
but just...

13:53.960 --> 13:56.599
little things.

13:56.700 --> 13:59.362
Such as?

13:59.470 --> 14:01.290
He looks...

14:05.110 --> 14:07.203
There's a word that's
lost all of its meaning,

14:07.310 --> 14:09.369
but it's what I think
of when I see him.

14:11.380 --> 14:13.075
What word?

14:13.180 --> 14:15.148
Haunted.

14:19.520 --> 14:20.987
What?

14:22.690 --> 14:24.021
It's not drinking.

14:24.130 --> 14:25.154
It's something else.

14:25.260 --> 14:26.522
What makes you say that?

14:26.660 --> 14:29.322
Because I saw _that look
that you're talkIng about.

14:29.430 --> 14:31.523
I saw it when he came
back from Ravenswood.

14:34.670 --> 14:36.194
You're concerned
about the suspect

14:36.300 --> 14:38.234
who was released
prematurely.

14:38.340 --> 14:40.877
I want to assure you,
we will catch him.

14:40.980 --> 14:42.436
That's good to know.

14:42.540 --> 14:45.008
Take reasonable
precaution,

14:45.150 --> 14:47.277
report anything out
of the ordinary, anything.

14:47.380 --> 14:49.416
Let us decide
what's relevant.

14:49.520 --> 14:50.544
We will.

14:54.390 --> 14:58.520
Oh, I have been meaning
to ask you all something.

15:01.360 --> 15:04.227
Who do you think
killed Bethany Young?

15:06.700 --> 15:09.339
Who do we think
killed her?

15:09.440 --> 15:11.032
Well, you must have
thought about it.

15:11.140 --> 15:15.179
How she was killed on the same
night Alison was kidnapped.

15:16.380 --> 15:20.271
Um, I haven't given
it much thought.

15:20.380 --> 15:22.109
Really?

15:22.220 --> 15:25.189
None of us knew
Bethany Young.

15:25.290 --> 15:26.484
I know that.

15:26.590 --> 15:28.478
We haven't been able
to find a Single connection

15:28.590 --> 15:30.251
between you
and the dead girl.

15:30.360 --> 15:33.523
Except, that she was
killed 30 yards away

15:33.630 --> 15:35.154
from where you
all were sleeping.

15:35.260 --> 15:37.922
I just thought you might
have talked about it.

15:38.070 --> 15:41.164
I guess girls are different
from when I was your age.

15:45.570 --> 15:46.605
( sighs )

15:46.740 --> 15:48.071
I think I'm going
to be sick.

15:48.210 --> 15:51.077
Just hold it until
she's out of sight.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.712
Hanna, we're all set.

15:55.820 --> 15:58.243
All you have to do is get
Caleb to the Applerose Grille.

15:58.350 --> 16:00.011
Tanner thinks
we killed Bethany Young.

16:00.120 --> 16:01.257
What--_What are
you talkIng about?

16:01.360 --> 16:03.123
Tanner.
She thinks we did it.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.629
Did she say this to you?

16:04.730 --> 16:06.049
Not in so many words.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.549
How many words, Hanna,
and in what order?

16:08.660 --> 16:10.025
( knocking on door)

16:10.130 --> 16:11.461
Hey, the front
door bell's out.

16:11.570 --> 16:12.559
Could you please
go get that?

16:12.670 --> 16:13.591
Sure.

16:13.700 --> 16:14.632
Hanna, where are you?

16:14.740 --> 16:15.695
And when did this happen?

16:15.800 --> 16:17.233
At the Mermaid Cafe.

16:17.340 --> 16:18.705
Me and Emily and Aria.

16:18.810 --> 16:20.368
She came up to tell us

16:20.510 --> 16:22.432
that they were trying
to catch Cyrus what's-his-name,

16:22.540 --> 16:24.076
but then she
ends up saying

16:24.180 --> 16:25.306
they're trying
to connect us with Bethany.

16:25.410 --> 16:27.048
There is no connection.

16:27.150 --> 16:28.469
There wasn't before,
but there is now.

16:28.580 --> 16:31.117
We made it ourselves,
when Aria got those drawings

16:31.220 --> 16:32.619
and you went to go meet
a man about a horse.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.551
Spencer, I don't think
the police believe a thing

16:34.660 --> 16:36.184
that All is saying.

16:36.290 --> 16:38.121
And they still think that
we're the five Mouseketeers.

16:38.260 --> 16:39.386
And I have Toby here.

16:39.490 --> 16:41.549
Just get Caleb
to the Applerose Grille, 7:30.

16:41.660 --> 16:42.729
And then we'll
talk then.

16:44.230 --> 16:46.562
Your sister isn't
at the Edgewood Motor Court.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.673
You want some privacy?

17:21.240 --> 17:24.698
Spencer, you're right.

17:24.840 --> 17:28.708
I have to tell you the truth
before it's too late.

17:28.810 --> 17:30.801
Dad's taking me
to the airport.

17:30.910 --> 17:33.117
I'm going back
to England.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.517
He's been wanting me
to go back

17:34.620 --> 17:36.576
since I told him what I told
him in the police station

17:36.680 --> 17:40.047
the night
you were gone.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.048
Maybe Dad's right

17:42.160 --> 17:45.459
and there's nothing
to do but keep quiet.

17:45.590 --> 17:48.457
But I can't just leave you.

17:48.560 --> 17:50.323
Not again.

17:50.430 --> 17:51.590
Not like this.

17:54.570 --> 17:58.199
So I'm going
to tell you the truth

17:58.340 --> 18:01.207
and you can do whatever
you want with it.

18:02.280 --> 18:04.248
Maybe it will help you,

18:04.350 --> 18:06.306
maybe it won't,

18:06.410 --> 18:07.843
but at least,
you'll know.

18:12.590 --> 18:15.252
I saw you the night
Alison disappeared.

18:16.790 --> 18:20.419
I heard you fighting
with her and I saw you.

18:23.570 --> 18:26.266
I saw you with a shovel
in your hand.

18:31.910 --> 18:35.232
It felt like everyone
who ever made

18:35.380 --> 18:38.440
the mistake of touching Ali
was there that night.

18:38.550 --> 18:41.246
What's that line
from The Tempest ?

18:41.350 --> 18:44.342
"This island
is full of noises."

18:44.450 --> 18:46.748
Then I saw the body.

18:48.390 --> 18:51.257
I thought you killed
Alison with that shovel.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.724
Now I'm not sure
what happened.

18:56.830 --> 18:59.492
But standing there
that's what I thought.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.591
And I didn't want
anybody to know.

19:02.770 --> 19:04.408
I couldn't look
at her face,

19:04.510 --> 19:07.809
so I pushed her in
and covered her up

19:07.940 --> 19:12.741
and I didn't tell anybody
about what I did

19:12.850 --> 19:14.442
or what I thought you did.

19:16.680 --> 19:18.819
Now I know
it wasn't Alison.

19:18.920 --> 19:21.912
And she wasn't dead
when I buried her.

19:23.360 --> 19:28.559
She was a stranger
and I buried her alive.

19:28.700 --> 19:31.464
Because I thought
I was protecting you.

19:31.570 --> 19:34.596
( sniffling )

19:34.700 --> 19:38.158
Our family has a gift
for self-preservation.

19:39.770 --> 19:44.469
But there's a point when you
go from survivor to predator.

19:46.450 --> 19:48.372
And I guess that's
what happened to us.

19:51.850 --> 19:53.852
Good-bye, Spencer.

19:55.520 --> 19:56.748
I love you.

20:23.850 --> 20:25.681
Okay,
don't push him, Toby.

20:25.790 --> 20:27.758
When I feel like Caleb's
relaxed enough,

20:27.860 --> 20:30.488
I'll tap you on the foot
and that's the heads-up

20:30.590 --> 20:31.784
that I'm going
to change the subject.

20:31.890 --> 20:33.790
Don't make such a big
deal out of this, Hanna.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.424
It is a big deal.

20:35.530 --> 20:36.599
Okay.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.893
Are you all right?

20:41.000 --> 20:41.967
Sure.

20:42.070 --> 20:43.367
( door opens )

20:43.510 --> 20:45.899
Okay, he's coming,
just play dumb.

20:46.010 --> 20:47.238
Hanna.

20:47.340 --> 20:48.477
He knows
what I'm talking about.

20:55.720 --> 20:58.689
So Hanna says you're
having trouble sleeping.

20:58.790 --> 20:59.814
What's the deal
with that?

21:03.790 --> 21:04.927
Don't look at me.

21:05.030 --> 21:05.928
This must be_how
boys communicate.

21:06.060 --> 21:07.925
Okay, what is this?

21:08.030 --> 21:09.497
She's worried about you.

21:09.600 --> 21:12.660
So is Spencer and to tell you
the truth, me, too.

21:12.770 --> 21:15.568
Who died
and made you Oprah?

21:15.670 --> 21:17.638
_ So there
IS something wrong.

21:17.740 --> 21:21.039
Caleb,
Hanna's scared.

21:21.140 --> 21:23.472
If you walk away,
she's still going to be afraid.

21:23.580 --> 21:25.468
Do you want things
to stay like that?

21:35.090 --> 21:37.524
Thanks.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.756
Hey.

21:38.860 --> 21:40.657
Hey.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.591
I didn't think you worked
this shift anymore.

21:42.700 --> 21:44.327
Uh, I don't.

21:44.430 --> 21:46.660
I mean I'm just
helping out tonight.

21:46.770 --> 21:48.032
Oh.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.698
Are you going
somewhere?

21:49.800 --> 21:53.008
I mean you must be
going somewhere.

21:53.110 --> 21:55.977
Yes, I am
going somewhere.

21:58.880 --> 22:00.848
In fact I got to go.

22:00.950 --> 22:02.440
Okay.

22:02.550 --> 22:03.744
Have a good night.

22:03.850 --> 22:04.885
Thanks.

22:24.810 --> 22:26.630
Hey, you made it.

22:26.740 --> 22:28.674
Yeah, sorry, I'm late.

22:28.780 --> 22:31.544
Your mom
had to cancel.

22:31.650 --> 22:32.742
Luclq me.

22:59.210 --> 23:00.905
MAN: Now, ladies
and gentlemen,

23:01.040 --> 23:02.837
tonight's screening will be
starting in just a few moments,

23:02.940 --> 23:04.999
so please silence
your cell phones.

23:05.110 --> 23:06.145
Thank you.

23:14.090 --> 23:17.082
( music playing )

23:23.060 --> 23:24.061
They're talking.

23:24.200 --> 23:26.668
Talking is good.

23:26.800 --> 23:29.564
What can he say to Toby
that he can't say to me?

23:29.670 --> 23:32.036
Sometimes people
want to tell you things,

23:32.140 --> 23:34.404
but they just can't look
you in the eye and say it.

23:34.510 --> 23:35.875
Why not?

23:35.980 --> 23:40.542
Because they're afraid
of what you'll think of them...

23:42.220 --> 23:46.111
that they let you down...

23:46.220 --> 23:48.415
that you let them down.

23:48.560 --> 23:49.811
Well, if you
love someone,

23:49.960 --> 23:51.825
you should be able
to tell them anything.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.427
That's the theory.

23:55.960 --> 23:57.598
It's human nature.

23:57.700 --> 23:59.463
You go around
this town tonight,

23:59.570 --> 24:00.832
youWIﬁnd
alotofguys

24:00.940 --> 24:02.089
who need to take the edge
off to get some sleep.

24:02.200 --> 24:03.804
Why even gamble?

24:03.910 --> 24:05.104
Why not just deal
with the thing

24:05.240 --> 24:06.832
that's ruining
your sleep?

24:06.940 --> 24:10.478
Cure the problem,
symptoms go away.

24:10.580 --> 24:12.571
A|| due respect, you don't
know what my problems are.

24:12.680 --> 24:14.671
Not true.

24:14.780 --> 24:15.917
I've been there.

24:16.020 --> 24:17.715
Been where?

24:18.890 --> 24:19.914
Ravenswood.

24:21.860 --> 24:25.125
You were a tourist,
man, I lived there.

24:25.230 --> 24:27.824
And maybe you brought
some of it back with you.

24:29.860 --> 24:31.191
Don't push this, Toby.

24:31.300 --> 24:33.120
What are you
so scared of

24:33.230 --> 24:35.733
that you'd rather
drink than face it?

24:37.570 --> 24:40.038
What are you so scared of
that you'd push Hanna away?

24:40.140 --> 24:42.472
You are crossing a very
serious line right now.

24:42.580 --> 24:44.878
Do you drink
during the day?

24:45.010 --> 24:46.477
No, I cut that out.

24:46.610 --> 24:47.542
Why?

24:47.650 --> 24:48.947
Because I got scared.

24:49.050 --> 24:50.472
Of what?

24:53.990 --> 24:55.184
Say it out loud.

25:02.300 --> 25:03.767
I should have
kept walking.

25:15.880 --> 25:18.769
( giggling )

25:21.320 --> 25:23.515
MAN: Hey, Miriam!

25:29.160 --> 25:31.720
BRUNO: Is your name Miriam?

25:31.830 --> 25:33.127
Why, yes.

25:33.230 --> 25:34.299
How did you...

25:52.680 --> 25:53.749
Excuse me.

25:59.690 --> 26:01.715
MAN: Miriam, where are you?

26:01.820 --> 26:03.549
Miriam!

26:03.690 --> 26:05.988
Hey, Miriam, come on,
stop fooling.

26:06.090 --> 26:08.650
I promised you dinner.

26:08.760 --> 26:10.819
Yeah, I just don't
feel like I earned it.

26:10.930 --> 26:11.828
You tried.

26:11.970 --> 26:14.097
All I did was screw it up.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.838
Toby...

26:18.370 --> 26:19.860
Don't you run
out on me, too.

26:19.970 --> 26:21.005
I'm not.

26:21.110 --> 26:22.907
I'm not running out
on you.

26:23.010 --> 26:24.307
I'm sorry.

26:24.410 --> 26:27.948
_ I was--
I was just mad at myself.

26:30.950 --> 26:32.178
Are you okay?

26:33.390 --> 26:35.085
Compared to what?

26:35.190 --> 26:36.214
Well, does this have
anything to do

26:36.320 --> 26:37.218
with what
Melissa sent you?

26:37.320 --> 26:38.856
No.

26:40.160 --> 26:42.151
Yes, maybe.

26:42.260 --> 26:43.898
What was it?

26:45.300 --> 26:50.067
It was a going-away present,
a little "forget-me-not".

26:50.170 --> 26:52.001
What was in the envelope?

26:54.010 --> 26:57.002
I think it was the truth.

26:57.110 --> 26:58.247
Only now
that I have it,

26:58.350 --> 26:59.999
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with it.

27:08.320 --> 27:11.289
So this was taken
16 months ago

27:11.390 --> 27:14.052
at a branch off the Turnpike,
near Donegal.

27:14.160 --> 27:16.048
You can tell by the code
that's in the time stamp.

27:16.160 --> 27:18.060
If you have that code,

27:18.170 --> 27:22.698
you can find also some
other interesting images.

27:24.170 --> 27:25.068
Cyrus Petrillo.

27:25.170 --> 27:26.762
Mm-hmm.

27:26.870 --> 27:29.839
Also known as Cyrus Hart,
Robert Hart and Cy Enfield,

27:29.940 --> 27:31.248
none of_them
solid Citizens.

27:31.350 --> 27:32.977
He's been arrested
half a dozen times.

27:33.080 --> 27:37.016
You have to know where to look,
but it's all petty stuff.

27:37.120 --> 27:38.348
No convictions.

27:38.450 --> 27:41.681
I wonder what she promised
him to get him to confess.

27:41.790 --> 27:44.156
You seem pretty sure that
that's what happened.

27:44.260 --> 27:45.727
A|| makes sense.

27:45.830 --> 27:47.821
At least the way
All thinks.

27:47.930 --> 27:49.295
She has an amazing
gift for knowing

27:49.400 --> 27:51.994
just what a person wants,
what they're missing.

27:52.100 --> 27:53.658
It's a very
special talent,

27:53.800 --> 27:55.336
one that causes
a lot of damage.

28:02.210 --> 28:05.668
MAN: Now when I nod my head,
you just try to cry on.

28:05.780 --> 28:08.214
I bet you can't do it.

28:08.350 --> 28:12.946
All right now, just wait
for the nod of my head.

28:23.870 --> 28:26.430
She's been gone
a long time.

28:27.870 --> 28:28.962
I'll go check on her.

28:40.280 --> 28:41.440
Mona?

28:44.050 --> 28:45.381
You are very good.

28:45.490 --> 28:47.708
You know right where
to put the knife

28:47.820 --> 28:50.084
and you're not
afraid to twist it.

28:50.190 --> 28:52.078
Alison underestimated you.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.258
Look”.

28:59.270 --> 29:00.965
I'm sorry.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.038
Don't insult me.

29:05.540 --> 29:07.007
You're right.

29:07.140 --> 29:08.402
Your dad should hate me.

29:08.540 --> 29:10.303
He should throw me
out of the house,

29:10.410 --> 29:13.140
after all the things
I've done to you,

29:13.250 --> 29:16.777
the way
I've treated Mike.

29:16.880 --> 29:18.814
He deserves someone
much nicer than me.

29:20.150 --> 29:22.015
He deserves _
someone who is nice,

29:22.120 --> 29:23.781
which I am not.

29:27.290 --> 29:28.450
Maybe I should
have just died

29:28.560 --> 29:30.425
when I fell off
that stupid cliff.

29:30.530 --> 29:32.862
Don't say that.

29:32.970 --> 29:34.892
Mona,
don't ever say that.

29:36.600 --> 29:39.808
I'm just trying
to protect myself.

29:39.910 --> 29:41.172
That's all
I've ever been doing,

29:41.310 --> 29:43.528
just protect
myself from her.

29:45.110 --> 29:46.941
Is that why you
built an army?

29:49.380 --> 29:51.018
It's hard to keep
the troops in line

29:51.120 --> 29:53.441
when Alison offers
them candy and a smile

29:53.550 --> 29:56.212
and that lilting
little laugh.

30:01.460 --> 30:04.918
Maybe you won't believe
this, but I'll say it anyway.

30:05.070 --> 30:06.924
When she
finishes with me,

30:07.070 --> 30:09.197
she'll come after
you and the others.

30:09.300 --> 30:12.406
She can't
trust you anymore.

30:12.510 --> 30:15.104
Not after Cyrus and...

30:15.210 --> 30:16.802
not after New York.

30:19.610 --> 30:21.817
What about New York?

30:23.220 --> 30:27.281
I know some things and
I can guess at some others.

30:32.530 --> 30:34.589
I have
to ask you something.

30:36.460 --> 30:37.859
What?

30:39.130 --> 30:41.030
Do you think Mike
really likes me?

30:46.310 --> 30:48.505
Maybe Dad's right

30:48.640 --> 30:52.041
and there's nothing
to do but keep quiet.

30:52.150 --> 30:54.448
But I can't just leave you.

30:54.550 --> 30:56.370
Not again.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.118
Not like this.

30:59.550 --> 31:02.087
You were always very good
at leaving, Melissa.

31:03.460 --> 31:05.985
You had a flair
for the grand exit.

31:08.060 --> 31:09.857
And there were times
you'd walk up those stairs

31:09.960 --> 31:12.428
and I just
wanted to applaud.

31:18.540 --> 31:21.338
What's that line
from The Tempest ?

31:21.440 --> 31:23.977
"This island
is full of noises."

31:24.080 --> 31:29.973
"Sounds and sweet airs that
give delight and hurt not."

31:30.080 --> 31:32.139
Then I saw the body.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.948
And you thought I did it.

31:40.230 --> 31:42.152
You're the one
who really killed her.

31:45.970 --> 31:47.119
Poor Melissa.

31:54.180 --> 31:58.901
She was a stranger
and I buried her alive.

31:59.010 --> 32:02.309
Because I thought
I was protecting you.

32:07.590 --> 32:10.457
Good-bye, Spencer.

32:10.560 --> 32:12.050
I love you.

32:14.630 --> 32:17.053
Good-bye, Melissa.

32:26.340 --> 32:29.434
Hey, is Mike back
from dropping off Mona?

32:29.540 --> 32:30.529
Not yet.

32:30.640 --> 32:32.073
What happened?

32:32.180 --> 32:35.547
We had a pretty long
talk in the ladies'.

32:35.650 --> 32:38.210
Anything resolved?

32:38.320 --> 32:41.585
Well, what's said in the powder
room stays in the powder room.

32:43.420 --> 32:47.220
I think things
will be okay with Mike.

32:47.330 --> 32:49.127
I just have
to keep an eye on her.

32:49.230 --> 32:51.289
Good.

32:51.400 --> 32:53.163
( knocking on door)

32:53.270 --> 32:54.692
Who's that?

32:54.800 --> 32:57.030
Probably Lt. Tanner.

32:57.140 --> 32:58.209
Tanner?

32:58.310 --> 32:59.459
Why?
What is she doing here?

32:59.570 --> 33:00.559
She left a voicemail.

33:00.670 --> 33:02.399
She wanted to talk to me.

33:02.510 --> 33:03.977
About what?

33:04.080 --> 33:05.638
That's what I'm going
to find out now.

33:23.230 --> 33:24.595
Going somewhere?

33:24.700 --> 33:26.520
I shouldn't have
come back here.

33:26.670 --> 33:30.094
But you had no right to pull
some stupid intervention on me.

33:32.340 --> 33:33.409
( sighs )

33:33.510 --> 33:35.068
Well, you're
right about that.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.569
So I came here
to apologize.

33:39.410 --> 33:42.709
But that was an hour ago
and I changed my mind,

33:42.820 --> 33:44.287
sitting here
in the dark,

33:44.390 --> 33:45.641
wondering if you were
in an alley somewhere

33:45.750 --> 33:46.739
or wrapped
around a tree.

33:46.850 --> 33:48.215
I can take care
of myself.

33:48.320 --> 33:49.252
No, you can't.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.281
What?

33:50.390 --> 33:51.687
I said,
no, you can't.

33:53.630 --> 33:56.224
You think you can
and usually you can,

33:56.330 --> 33:57.297
but this time
you're wrong.

33:57.400 --> 33:58.424
And you know it.

34:05.270 --> 34:09.673
Caleb, I will fight for you,
but you have to trust me.

34:12.350 --> 34:13.578
If we don't
trust each other,

34:13.680 --> 34:17.275
then I might as well
just help you pack.

34:22.260 --> 34:23.716
What did you
want to ask me?

34:23.820 --> 34:27.187
Um, not so much ask,
just talk.

34:27.330 --> 34:30.458
I've been talking to all
the parents of Alison's friends.

34:30.600 --> 34:32.067
And you've been
talking to the friends.

34:32.200 --> 34:34.498
Sometimes without
any adults around.

34:34.600 --> 34:37.797
I know the rules,
Mr. Montgomery.

34:37.900 --> 34:40.061
No one's trying
to trick the girls.

34:40.210 --> 34:42.337
They just need to know
how serious this is.

34:42.440 --> 34:44.476
It seems to me that you
should be putting your energy

34:44.580 --> 34:47.071
into finding the kidnapper
that you released.

34:48.150 --> 34:50.072
A man confesses
to a crime,

34:50.180 --> 34:52.580
then disappears
the moment he's released.

34:52.690 --> 34:54.578
What do you think
changed his mind?

34:54.690 --> 34:56.715
I have no idea.

34:56.820 --> 35:00.358
This town ranks surprisingly
low on curiosity.

35:00.490 --> 35:02.390
Well, we may not have
a lot of imagination,

35:02.500 --> 35:04.491
but we expect
the police to do their job.

35:04.630 --> 35:06.495
Hmm.

35:06.600 --> 35:09.364
I'll tell you something
about homicide investigations.

35:09.500 --> 35:11.809
They tend to get
less complicated

35:11.910 --> 35:13.468
as you work
them, not more.

35:13.570 --> 35:15.731
If they start getting
more complicated,

35:15.840 --> 35:19.173
you can be sure that someone
is doing that on purpose...

35:19.280 --> 35:21.475
someone smart.

35:21.580 --> 35:25.118
And there are so many smart
people involved in this case.

35:25.220 --> 35:27.245
It makes my job
very interesting.

35:27.390 --> 35:28.482
Well,
I'm only interested

35:28.590 --> 35:30.581
in where your job
affects my daughter.

35:30.690 --> 35:33.784
You want to know if the police
are interested in Aria?

35:35.430 --> 35:36.556
We are.

35:37.800 --> 35:40.166
She may or may not
be involved in a homicide,

35:40.270 --> 35:43.797
but I'm certain she's
part of the complications.

35:43.900 --> 35:45.231
Well,
if you're so sure,

35:45.340 --> 35:47.262
why haven't you done
something about it,

35:47.370 --> 35:49.702
instead of harassing
these girls?

35:49.810 --> 35:52.142
I wouldn't
call it harassing.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.419
I've just been waiting
for one of them to step up

35:54.520 --> 35:57.341
and say that they are
willing to tell me the truth.

35:57.450 --> 35:58.781
And now
one of them has.

36:00.290 --> 36:01.587
And I expect
to have

36:01.690 --> 36:05.683
a very enlightening
conversation with her tomorrow.

36:05.790 --> 36:07.587
I just thought
you might want to know.

36:08.830 --> 36:10.525
Which one wants
to talk to you?

36:12.930 --> 36:14.693
Goodnight,
Mr. Montgomery.

36:23.940 --> 36:25.771
( door closes )

36:29.850 --> 36:30.874
I'm not talking
to Tanner.

36:30.980 --> 36:32.311
Neither am I.

36:32.420 --> 36:33.444
Well, I couldn't
think it was you.

36:33.550 --> 36:34.858
Where's Hanna?

36:34.960 --> 36:36.655
I called all of you, but
her phone went to voicemail.

36:36.760 --> 36:37.658
It's not Hanna.

36:37.760 --> 36:39.853
Oh, my God.

36:39.990 --> 36:41.491
Alison.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.295
Maybe we can stop her.

36:44.400 --> 36:45.424
How?

36:49.540 --> 36:50.666
Where did you get this?

36:50.770 --> 36:51.907
Ezra.

36:53.370 --> 36:54.871
Who else was
going to help us?

36:56.710 --> 36:59.679
Well, it's the end of Ali's
kidnap story if we use this.

36:59.780 --> 37:01.247
Maybe.

37:01.350 --> 37:03.875
Depends on what "truth"
she decides to tell this time.

37:04.020 --> 37:05.385
I have to show you
guys something.

37:05.490 --> 37:07.879
I'm sorry I can't
wait for Hanna.

37:10.520 --> 37:14.456
They called it a pact, but what
this town made was a contract.

37:14.560 --> 37:16.255
With this preacher.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.726
With what
the preacher represented.

37:18.830 --> 37:21.867
But contracts
have loopholes.

37:21.970 --> 37:25.508
So what did you do,
you and the others?

37:25.640 --> 37:28.438
We took the jars
down to the bridge

37:28.540 --> 37:31.907
where the car went in
the water that first night.

37:32.050 --> 37:33.904
And we opened them...

37:34.010 --> 37:39.380
all of them and released
whatever was in5ide.

37:39.490 --> 37:41.685
And what happened?

37:43.460 --> 37:47.487
Nothing for a minute.

37:47.590 --> 37:51.526
Then the woods
were filled with fireflies...

37:51.630 --> 37:53.268
millions of them.

37:56.100 --> 37:58.034
They drifted up
into the trees and...

38:00.370 --> 38:01.701
they were gone.

38:04.680 --> 38:07.808
Mrs. Grunwald called it
"a great ascendency".

38:09.020 --> 38:11.341
And after that?

38:11.450 --> 38:15.557
No demons,
no messages, no revenge.

38:15.660 --> 38:18.424
And no Miranda.

38:18.530 --> 38:20.486
She was gone.

38:20.590 --> 38:23.320
Then you kept
your promise.

38:23.430 --> 38:24.590
You took care of her.

38:24.700 --> 38:26.691
I have--

38:26.800 --> 38:29.439
I've spent this whole time
trying to talk myself into that.

38:29.540 --> 38:32.759
You did help her,
Caleb.

38:32.870 --> 38:34.531
And now
you're back with me.

38:34.640 --> 38:38.599
I'm not the same person
that I was when I left here.

38:40.050 --> 38:42.439
Yes, you are.

38:42.580 --> 38:43.979
I know you.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.849
You see this?

38:51.960 --> 38:54.849
It's just a game, a toy.
Right?

38:56.630 --> 38:58.598
That's a lie.

38:58.730 --> 38:59.867
This is real.

39:01.470 --> 39:02.767
People turned it
into a game

39:02.870 --> 39:05.907
and they forgot
what it's really for.

39:06.010 --> 39:08.877
They forgot because
they were afraid of it.

39:11.080 --> 39:12.877
Hanna, there
is a whole another world,

39:12.980 --> 39:17.019
just right past
the corner of our eye.

39:17.120 --> 39:19.042
And I've seen it.

39:19.150 --> 39:22.119
That's why
you can't sleep.

39:22.220 --> 39:23.619
I can sleep.

39:23.760 --> 39:27.628
Ijust...

39:27.730 --> 39:29.493
I'm afraid
of my own dreams.

39:29.630 --> 39:31.359
Why?

39:34.570 --> 39:36.697
After she died,

39:36.800 --> 39:40.509
first time Miranda
talked to me was in a dream.

39:43.140 --> 39:46.075
I'm just afraid that she's
going to show up again

39:46.180 --> 39:48.375
and she's gonna--

39:48.520 --> 39:49.873
she's gonna tell me
that it was all wrong

39:49.980 --> 39:52.619
and that she's not okay

39:52.720 --> 39:53.744
and that it's my fault.

40:00.790 --> 40:02.792
Look, maybe you're
not the person

40:02.900 --> 40:04.697
you were
when you left.

40:06.670 --> 40:12.006
But I'm not exactly
who I used to be either.

40:12.110 --> 40:14.032
Caleb,
we'll get through this.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.548
I didn't come this far not
to have a happy ending.

40:47.070 --> 40:50.005
Good-bye, Spencer.

40:50.110 --> 40:51.577
I love you.

40:57.250 --> 40:59.582
I just got that today.

40:59.690 --> 41:01.214
It took me
a while to decide

41:01.320 --> 41:02.685
whether or not
to show it to you.

41:02.790 --> 41:05.782
Understood.

41:05.890 --> 41:07.926
Melissa killed
Bethany Young.

41:08.030 --> 41:10.123
She thought that
she just buried her.

41:10.230 --> 41:11.629
She thought
that I killed her.

41:11.730 --> 41:13.960
She doesn't sound
so sure of that now.

41:15.900 --> 41:18.198
But the police think that we all
had something to do with this.

41:18.300 --> 41:20.507
When Melissa
saw Bethany,

41:20.610 --> 41:22.771
she was wearing
Alison's clothes.

41:22.880 --> 41:25.474
Another set
of Alison's clothes.

41:25.580 --> 41:26.604
There had to be
a duplicate set.

41:26.710 --> 41:27.904
A|i wasn't walking
around naked.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.615
Are you saying it was
always someone's idea

41:31.750 --> 41:32.614
that Bethany
take Ali's place?

41:32.750 --> 41:33.887
Tell me another way

41:33.990 --> 41:35.548
that Bethany ends up
in that yellow top.

41:35.660 --> 41:38.117
We need to figure out a way
around that picture of "A"

41:38.220 --> 41:39.619
at the hospital
or we're busted.

41:39.760 --> 41:40.988
What picture of "A"?

41:41.090 --> 41:42.091
Picture of Alison.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.155
No, you said
a picture of "A".

41:43.300 --> 41:45.120
No, I didn't.
Yeah, you did.

41:46.170 --> 41:47.194
Slip of the tongue.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.233
Spencer, what are you
gonna do with that?

42:03.320 --> 42:06.642
* The ground beneath
is shaking *

42:06.790 --> 42:09.588
* Oh-oh-oh

42:09.690 --> 42:13.148
* The peace
that we've been faking *

42:15.800 --> 42:19.190
* The ground beneath
is shaking *

42:21.740 --> 42:23.196
( dialing )

42:23.300 --> 42:25.803
* We built a s_i|ence
worth breaking *

42:28.240 --> 42:32.244
* Silence worth breaking
