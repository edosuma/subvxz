00:03.190 --> 00:04.980
<b>Your technique</b>

00:05.500 --> 00:08.980
<b>has two huge weaknesses!</b>

01:35.990 --> 01:40.990
<b>Compassion x And x Strength</b>

01:42.420 --> 01:46.510
<b>Gon has finally challenged 
Knuckle to a serious fight.</b>

01:46.510 --> 01:51.500
<b>However, Knuckle claims that 
Gon's technique has serious flaws.</b>

01:56.170 --> 01:57.550
<b>So, Gon...</b>

01:58.780 --> 02:02.300
<b>What did you name that technique?</b>

02:02.590 --> 02:07.010
<b><i>Oops! I think I forgot to name my attack.</i></b>

02:08.330 --> 02:10.170
<b>Ja-Janken!</b>

02:10.170 --> 02:12.310
<b>Wow, zero effort...</b>

02:15.110 --> 02:17.050
<b>Jajanken...</b>

02:17.050 --> 02:18.910
<b>I understand.</b>

02:18.910 --> 02:24.200
<b>You combined "jajan" for "ta-dah," with 
"janken" for your attack, "Rock-Paper-Scissors."</b>

02:24.510 --> 02:26.190
<b>Ah, no...</b>

02:27.040 --> 02:30.080
<b><i>The first "ja" was a stutter.</i></b>

02:31.580 --> 02:34.620
<b>Not a bad name, kid!</b>

02:34.620 --> 02:36.140
<b>Uh, yeah.</b>

02:36.140 --> 02:37.690
<b>Guess I'm okay with that.</b>

02:37.690 --> 02:38.840
<b><i>You are?!</i></b>

02:39.210 --> 02:44.010
<b>Gon, your Jajanken has two huge weaknesses.</b>

02:44.580 --> 02:46.970
<b>First, it takes too long to charge.</b>

02:48.860 --> 02:54.360
<b>During a fight, you don't have time 
to stand still for several seconds.</b>

02:54.360 --> 02:57.780
<b>I wouldn't count on having the time to charge it.</b>

02:57.780 --> 02:59.240
<b>I know that.</b>

02:59.690 --> 03:01.860
<b>Second, it's too risky.</b>

03:03.510 --> 03:08.260
<b>When you focus aura in your 
fist to increase power,</b>

03:08.260 --> 03:10.890
<b>you have less aura for defense.</b>

03:10.890 --> 03:14.750
<b>One attack to the wrong place 
will take you out, fool!</b>

03:15.170 --> 03:17.320
<b>I know the risks.</b>

03:17.320 --> 03:21.760
<b>That's why I've spent the past month 
training to compensate for them!</b>

03:24.760 --> 03:28.090
<b><i>Now that I see it again, 
his aura really is something.</i></b>

03:28.090 --> 03:32.150
<b><i>In terms of volume, he has 
as much as a mid-level pro.</i></b>

03:32.580 --> 03:34.020
<b><i>He's so close...</i></b>

03:37.520 --> 03:39.690
<b><i>But you still lack</i></b>

03:41.210 --> 03:42.780
<b><i>experience.</i></b>

03:47.060 --> 03:48.730
<b><i>You haven't been in</i></b>

03:50.460 --> 03:52.290
<b><i>enough real fights!</i></b>

03:55.500 --> 03:57.970
<b><i>You've got plenty of determination.</i></b>

03:57.970 --> 04:00.130
<b><i>It seems you've looked death 
in the eye many times,</i></b>

04:00.130 --> 04:02.300
<b><i>and you have natural talent.</i></b>

04:02.580 --> 04:05.230
<b><i>However, you're still unrefined.</i></b>

04:07.370 --> 04:09.600
<b><i>Your aura is too rough!</i></b>

04:10.850 --> 04:13.490
<b><i>I can tell which area you're defending.</i></b>

04:13.490 --> 04:16.030
<b><i>I can see what you're trying to do.</i></b>

04:16.770 --> 04:19.440
<b><i>Your aura gives it all away.</i></b>

04:22.300 --> 04:26.490
<b><i>So if I use that information to fake you out,</i></b>

04:29.780 --> 04:32.450
<b><i>shifting your intended point of attack...</i></b>

04:43.330 --> 04:44.500
<b><i>This is the result!</i></b>

04:48.150 --> 04:49.310
<b>Damn...</b>

04:49.310 --> 04:52.350
<b><i>His aura is giving away his every move!</i></b>

04:55.570 --> 04:58.610
<b><i>I was right! Knuckle really is...</i></b>

05:00.320 --> 05:02.030
<b>Okay, then...</b>

05:02.730 --> 05:05.110
<b>Time to throw a real punch.</b>

05:05.730 --> 05:06.860
<b><i>He's so...</i></b>

05:07.170 --> 05:10.140
<b>Don't blame me if you die.</b>

05:11.120 --> 05:12.870
<b><i>He's so gentle!</i></b>

05:13.160 --> 05:14.480
<b><i>Behind you, fool!</i></b>

05:18.760 --> 05:21.920
<b><i>Without his warning, I could have died.</i></b>

05:23.130 --> 05:25.970
<b><i>First, it takes too long to charge.</i></b>

05:26.940 --> 05:28.800
<b><i>He's teaching me when he doesn't have to...</i></b>

05:29.350 --> 05:31.850
<b><i>And providing guidance.</i></b>

05:33.080 --> 05:35.860
<b><i>He's telling me how to become stronger.</i></b>

05:39.400 --> 05:40.860
<b><i>He's too gentle!</i></b>

05:45.160 --> 05:49.060
<b><i>First comes rock...</i></b>

06:05.360 --> 06:08.360
<b>I told you that you won't pull off that attack.</b>

06:08.360 --> 06:09.840
<b>Don't fool around with me!</b>

06:10.810 --> 06:13.850
<b>That was your full strength?</b>

06:16.320 --> 06:18.280
<b>Which one of us is fooling around?!</b>

06:19.150 --> 06:20.850
<b>It's supposed to be a serious fight!</b>

06:21.320 --> 06:24.360
<b>You should be fighting to kill, Knuckle!</b>

06:27.600 --> 06:32.700
<b><i>First comes rock...</i></b>

06:39.030 --> 06:40.000
<b>Here I go!</b>

06:41.440 --> 06:42.500
<b><i>Rock...</i></b>

06:47.090 --> 06:48.100
<b>Over here!</b>

06:54.550 --> 06:56.890
<b><i>First comes rock...</i></b>

06:57.590 --> 06:58.390
<b><i>Rock...</i></b>

07:13.700 --> 07:15.300
<b><i>Bastard...</i></b>

07:15.300 --> 07:18.120
<b><i>He faked me out with his Jajanken.</i></b>

07:19.710 --> 07:22.770
<b>It's obvious that you're focused 
on stopping my special attack.</b>

07:22.770 --> 07:27.130
<b>Even I could tell exactly when your 
right arm was going to strike.</b>

07:28.410 --> 07:32.770
<b><i>He's using Jajanken's weakness, the long 
charge time, against his opponent.</i></b>

07:33.220 --> 07:35.470
<b><i>He's playing mind games.</i></b>

07:37.140 --> 07:41.910
<b><i>Knuckle sees Gon's Jajanken as an easy pitch.</i></b>

07:41.910 --> 07:43.630
<b><i>He has to swing for it.</i></b>

07:43.630 --> 07:46.770
<b><i>It's a perfect pitch, right down the 
middle, that he has to send flying.</i></b>

07:47.830 --> 07:49.280
<b><i>That's the trigger.</i></b>

07:49.810 --> 07:52.660
<b><i>When you see the easy ball, you tense up.</i></b>

07:53.720 --> 07:55.410
<b><i>You can hit it. You have to.</i></b>

07:55.970 --> 07:59.910
<b><i>These thoughts make you use 
more strength than necessary.</i></b>

08:00.500 --> 08:02.860
<b><i>The same thing applies to aura.</i></b>

08:03.340 --> 08:05.550
<b><i>If a </i>Nen <i>user doesn't control their aura,</i></b>

08:05.550 --> 08:07.580
<b><i>it will gather in areas of tension.</i></b>

08:07.580 --> 08:10.440
<b><i>The moment of the swing, it intensifies further.</i></b>

08:11.630 --> 08:15.620
<b><i>If the</i> Nen <i>user is inexperienced or out of control, </i></b>

08:15.620 --> 08:19.470
<b><i>the aura will either stagnate 
or just flow too freely.</i></b>

08:20.330 --> 08:22.160
<b><i>The flow of the aura</i></b>

08:22.160 --> 08:24.310
<b><i>lets the opponent sense 
when an attack will come.</i></b>

08:24.930 --> 08:27.820
<b><i>You should be fighting to kill, Knuckle!</i></b>

08:28.280 --> 08:31.820
<b><i>By calling him out for being soft, 
Gon threw Knuckle off.</i></b>

08:32.100 --> 08:34.320
<b><i>As a result, he managed to fake Knuckle out.</i></b>

08:35.220 --> 08:39.690
<b><i>I'd think this tactic would be more effective 
on those who know Jajanken's strength.</i></b>

08:40.540 --> 08:44.920
<b><i>Opponents who have seen how 
strong the technique can be</i></b>

08:44.920 --> 08:49.180
<b><i>will be more scared and likely to lose 
control when they see it coming.</i></b>

08:49.880 --> 08:52.380
<b><i>The fake-out will be more believable,</i></b>

08:52.380 --> 08:53.740
<b><i>and if the enemy steps back,</i></b>

08:53.740 --> 08:56.230
<b><i>they're easier to hit with Scissors or Paper.</i></b>

08:58.190 --> 08:59.470
<b><i>I always assumed Jajanken</i></b>

08:59.470 --> 09:02.830
<b><i>would be less useful once opponents 
figured out how it works.</i></b>

09:03.450 --> 09:05.080
<b><i>That it was flawed.</i></b>

09:06.090 --> 09:07.300
<b><i>But I was wrong.</i></b>

09:07.300 --> 09:09.060
<b><i>It can be adapted to any situation.</i></b>

09:09.990 --> 09:12.360
<b>Okay, let's try this again.</b>

09:12.700 --> 09:15.400
<b><i>In the second attempt, he was 
too focused on the technique</i></b>

09:15.400 --> 09:17.340
<b><i>and let Knuckle land a kick on him.</i></b>

09:17.340 --> 09:21.140
<b><i>But if he learns to better control his aura 
in response to the opponent's movement,</i></b>

09:21.140 --> 09:23.970
<b><i>it will be harder to distinguish between</i></b>

09:23.970 --> 09:25.500
<b><i>fake and real Jajanken attempts.</i></b>

09:27.280 --> 09:31.260
<b><i>Gon's been thinking how to shore 
up his technique's weaknesses.</i></b>

09:35.620 --> 09:36.630
<b><i>No...</i></b>

09:37.530 --> 09:40.450
<b><i>He thought of the solution during this fight.</i></b>

09:41.620 --> 09:46.520
<b><i>He's making incredible progress while fighting.</i></b>

09:51.020 --> 09:54.740
<b><i>I'm already getting tired.</i></b>

09:55.080 --> 09:57.690
<b><i>We haven't even been 
fighting for twenty minutes.</i></b>

09:58.400 --> 10:01.800
<b><i>Moving so much is sapping my energy.</i></b>

10:02.380 --> 10:06.790
<b><i>If an hour of training is comparable 
to ten minutes of fighting,</i></b>

10:07.240 --> 10:10.170
<b><i>I'll only be able to maintain my </i>Ken <i>for another ten minutes.</i></b>

10:11.100 --> 10:14.890
<b><i>If my aura defense goes down, I'm finished.</i></b>

10:15.630 --> 10:17.170
<b><i>Before then, I have to end this.</i></b>

10:18.320 --> 10:19.680
<b><i>By using Jajanken.</i></b>

10:23.550 --> 10:25.810
<b>Bring it!</b>

10:36.970 --> 10:39.680
<b><i>Knuckle definitely has superior physical strength.</i></b>

10:40.070 --> 10:42.950
<b><i>But Gon is adapting, little by little.</i></b>

10:43.570 --> 10:46.430
<b><i>By increasing the area his aura covers,</i></b>

10:46.430 --> 10:48.590
<b><i>he reduces the damage from miscalculations.</i></b>

10:49.460 --> 10:51.680
<b><i>And he's getting used to Knuckle's speed.</i></b>

10:52.250 --> 10:54.620
<b><i>Sudden punches almost never hit him anymore.</i></b>

10:55.720 --> 10:57.460
<b><i>But he's running out of time.</i></b>

10:58.760 --> 11:01.970
<b><i>He doesn't have much stamina 
left to maintain his aura.</i></b>

11:03.180 --> 11:06.390
<b><i>On the other hand, Knuckle has 
been conserving his strength,</i></b>

11:06.390 --> 11:08.480
<b><i>only attacking with physical blows.</i></b>

11:09.490 --> 11:14.600
<b><i>Jajanken requires a large 
amount of aura just to charge.</i></b>

11:14.600 --> 11:17.990
<b><i>A fake Jajanken still drains a fair amount.</i></b>

11:18.520 --> 11:21.670
<b><i>Gon's already activated his technique three times.</i></b>

11:23.580 --> 11:25.960
<b><i>They started fighting twenty minutes ago.</i></b>

11:26.890 --> 11:31.300
<b><i>If he uses Jajanken again, 
he'll only have a minute or two</i></b>

11:31.800 --> 11:34.160
<b><i>to fight at full strength.</i></b>

11:48.450 --> 11:49.540
<b>Gon...</b>

11:50.160 --> 11:52.980
<b>You told me to use my full strength,</b>

11:52.980 --> 11:56.110
<b>but you're no match for me right now.</b>

11:57.640 --> 11:58.690
<b>You're...</b>

11:59.940 --> 12:02.360
<b><i>First comes</i></b>

12:03.160 --> 12:04.700
<b><i>rock...</i></b>

12:07.390 --> 12:08.200
<b><i>Why?</i></b>

12:09.960 --> 12:11.020
<b><i>What...</i></b>

12:12.520 --> 12:13.960
<b><i>is he going to do?</i></b>

12:21.130 --> 12:23.500
<b><i>First comes</i></b>

12:24.010 --> 12:25.600
<b><i>rock...</i></b>

12:29.410 --> 12:30.670
<b><i>Why?</i></b>

12:30.670 --> 12:34.480
<b><i>Knuckle's in good shape and alert, 
and he's attacking from that distance?</i></b>

12:34.790 --> 12:37.980
<b><i>He isn't even going to hit Knuckle.</i></b>

12:42.640 --> 12:46.190
<b><i>This is definitely Gon's final attack.</i></b>

12:46.530 --> 12:48.370
<b><i>This will end it.</i></b>

12:48.740 --> 12:52.040
<b><i>Rock... Scissors...</i></b>

12:52.040 --> 12:55.370
<b><i>Paper!</i></b>

13:00.150 --> 13:02.050
<b><i>An Emitter attack?</i></b>

13:02.630 --> 13:06.140
<b><i>But it's much weaker than his Rock.</i></b>

13:07.610 --> 13:10.390
<b><i>You're definitely an Enhancer.</i></b>

13:11.080 --> 13:14.020
<b><i>Your power as an Emitter is far lower.</i></b>

13:14.850 --> 13:18.050
<b><i>No speed... No punch.</i></b>

13:18.050 --> 13:21.900
<b><i>He can't have any more tricks up his sleeve.</i></b>

13:22.250 --> 13:25.150
<b><i>Once I knock that aside, it's over!</i></b>

13:28.280 --> 13:30.740
<b>Once again!</b>

13:31.470 --> 13:32.870
<b><i>Once again?</i></b>

13:34.000 --> 13:36.370
<b><i>He used that ball as cover 
to move behind me?</i></b>

13:36.710 --> 13:38.000
<b><i>Crap!</i></b>

13:38.000 --> 13:40.350
<b><i>Two Jajankens in a row...</i></b>

13:41.900 --> 13:44.880
<b><i>Rock!</i></b>

14:16.360 --> 14:21.340
<b><i>He must have depleted his 
aura before Rock hit.</i></b>

14:22.370 --> 14:26.720
<b><i>Otherwise, I'd be the one on the ground...</i></b>

14:34.310 --> 14:36.310
<b>Where are you going, fool?</b>

14:36.730 --> 14:38.240
<b>I'm going back.</b>

14:38.240 --> 14:40.220
<b>Aren't you going to fight?</b>

14:40.220 --> 14:41.560
<b>I'm fine here.</b>

14:42.370 --> 14:44.810
<b>You can fight Gon again tomorrow.</b>

14:45.470 --> 14:47.810
<b>The outcome will probably be different.</b>

14:48.790 --> 14:50.660
<b>I'll defeat Shoot.</b>

14:51.820 --> 14:53.430
<b>Tell Gon this.</b>

14:54.210 --> 14:57.940
<b>Tomorrow, I'll be fighting for real.</b>

14:57.940 --> 15:00.080
<b>He'd better be prepared to die.</b>

15:00.810 --> 15:03.610
<b>It sounds like you're trying to convince yourself.</b>

15:04.360 --> 15:05.590
<b>Sure you're up to the task?</b>

15:06.020 --> 15:07.910
<b>Hell, yeah, fool.</b>

15:08.760 --> 15:10.050
<b>Tomorrow...</b>

15:12.350 --> 15:14.420
<b>As long as you win,</b>

15:14.420 --> 15:15.900
<b>it's fine if you don't get serious.</b>

15:16.940 --> 15:21.310
<b>But if you lose without fighting at full strength,</b>

15:21.310 --> 15:22.100
<b>I won't forgive you.</b>

15:25.260 --> 15:28.010
<b>I'll never forgive you, as long as I live.</b>

15:38.160 --> 15:41.260
<b>You're still soft.</b>

15:42.360 --> 15:45.940
<b>Why are you helping the enemy?</b>

15:45.940 --> 15:49.880
<b>And the enemy is blasting you for it, as well...</b>

15:49.880 --> 15:55.140
<b>If you don't want to go to NGL, 
hand over your token to them.</b>

15:55.640 --> 15:58.930
<b>Though I'm sure that they'll refuse it.</b>

15:59.350 --> 16:00.800
<b>Bastard...</b>

16:01.750 --> 16:05.620
<b>You're pretty cocky when you aren't 
shaking in your boots, eh?</b>

16:05.620 --> 16:10.490
<b>The past month, all you've done is stalk them!</b>

16:10.890 --> 16:11.900
<b>I'll fight.</b>

16:12.720 --> 16:15.860
<b>Tomorrow, I'll join the fight.</b>

16:28.860 --> 16:30.370
<b>Don't worry.</b>

16:30.370 --> 16:32.780
<b>I gave him a massage, so he'll be able to fight</b>

16:32.780 --> 16:34.750
<b>in top condition tomorrow.</b>

16:36.110 --> 16:38.540
<b><i>Killua's the real issue...</i></b>

16:38.540 --> 16:39.920
<b><i>I wasn't expecting him to go</i></b>

16:39.920 --> 16:42.870
<b><i>the whole month without fighting once.</i></b>

16:45.220 --> 16:46.260
<b>Killua!</b>

16:49.830 --> 16:51.820
<b>Fight me.</b>

16:56.320 --> 16:57.150
<b>Huh?</b>

16:59.730 --> 17:02.330
<b>What happened to your face, Killua?!</b>

17:03.450 --> 17:06.080
<b>Huh? I was training with Bisky.</b>

17:06.370 --> 17:08.860
<b>Training? Are you sure it wasn't a lynching?</b>

17:08.860 --> 17:12.900
<b>Anyway, are you feeling okay?</b>

17:12.900 --> 17:14.220
<b>Yep, I feel great.</b>

17:14.610 --> 17:20.060
<b>I used up all my aura, so I expected 
to be tired, but look!</b>

17:20.610 --> 17:22.040
<b>That gorill—</b>

17:22.040 --> 17:25.310
<b>That old hag's massage must have done the trick.</b>

17:26.270 --> 17:27.730
<b>That was close.</b>

17:28.730 --> 17:30.200
<b><i>Listen now...</i></b>

17:30.200 --> 17:32.470
<b><i>If you tell anyone what happened yesterday,</i></b>

17:32.470 --> 17:34.610
<b><i>I'll make your face three times worse.</i></b>

17:37.740 --> 17:39.240
<b>She wasn't joking.</b>

17:41.080 --> 17:44.650
<b><i>Now, do you know your weakness?</i></b>

17:48.750 --> 17:50.750
<b><i>You're too quick to give up.</i></b>

17:52.120 --> 17:54.790
<b><i>You're too cautious about fighting.</i></b>

17:54.790 --> 17:58.380
<b><i>Some might say you underestimate yourself.</i></b>

17:59.300 --> 18:02.960
<b><i>When facing an enemy you 
believe to be stronger,</i></b>

18:03.900 --> 18:06.880
<b><i>you fight on the premise of escaping.</i></b>

18:11.490 --> 18:15.090
<b><i>I realize that this isn't your fault.</i></b>

18:15.090 --> 18:18.720
<b><i>It's the fault of whoever taught you to fight.</i></b>

18:25.700 --> 18:30.470
<b><i>Habits that are burned into your 
body and soul aren't easy to break.</i></b>

18:31.990 --> 18:34.050
<b><i>But I can say one thing for sure.</i></b>

18:36.440 --> 18:40.050
<b><i>Somewhere down the line, 
you'll leave Gon behind to die.</i></b>

18:45.610 --> 18:47.360
<b><i>Combat ability can change,</i></b>

18:47.360 --> 18:50.560
<b><i>depending on environment 
and physical condition.</i></b>

18:50.560 --> 18:52.620
<b><i>For example, a good-condition C</i></b>

18:52.620 --> 18:55.190
<b><i>has a high chance of defeating 
a poor-condition D.</i></b>

18:56.170 --> 18:59.950
<b><i>If the conditions are right, A, B, and C</i></b>

18:59.950 --> 19:02.920
<b><i>all have the potential to defeat D.</i></b>

19:03.370 --> 19:05.700
<b><i>But in your case, you're assuming</i></b>

19:06.540 --> 19:08.970
<b><i>the enemy is always at their best.</i></b>

19:08.970 --> 19:12.260
<b><i>You always assume the worst-case scenario.</i></b>

19:15.330 --> 19:17.770
<b><i>Even when facing enemies with equal strength,</i></b>

19:17.770 --> 19:21.800
<b><i>you worry about how strong they are, 
or what they might do to you.</i></b>

19:22.650 --> 19:26.210
<b><i>If we're talking about a stronger 
enemy, there's no question...</i></b>

19:26.210 --> 19:29.730
<b><i>You don't bother to think of how you could win.</i></b>

19:30.250 --> 19:33.530
<b><i>Running is your only option. 
That's how losers think.</i></b>

19:34.990 --> 19:38.070
<b><i>Suppressing that bad habit and forcing yourself</i></b>

19:38.070 --> 19:43.740
<b><i>to face enemies stronger than 
you will take determination.</i></b>

19:44.710 --> 19:49.540
<b><i>If you can't defeat Shoot tomorrow,</i></b>

19:51.210 --> 19:53.350
<b><i>you must leave Gon's side.</i></b>

19:58.060 --> 20:00.760
<b>Okay! I'm gonna win this time!</b>

20:15.790 --> 20:16.880
<b>Let's go.</b>

20:17.370 --> 20:18.530
<b>Yeah.</b>

20:27.370 --> 20:34.330
<b><i>Killua's overly cautious style is the 
product of a smothering love.</i></b>

20:38.050 --> 20:40.720
<b><i>A twisted, self-serving love...</i></b>

20:41.800 --> 20:46.320
<b><i>That just makes his habits stronger, 
deeper, and harder to break.</i></b>

20:46.820 --> 20:50.950
<b><i>Without extraordinary willpower, 
this curse cannot be broken.</i></b>

21:05.430 --> 21:10.230
<b><i>I don't know who will emerge victorious...</i></b>

21:12.020 --> 21:13.330
<b><i>All right, then...</i></b>

21:15.370 --> 21:16.730
<b><i>Time to run for it.</i></b>

21:45.320 --> 21:47.030
<b>The loser...</b>

21:47.590 --> 21:49.920
<b>Hands his token to the winner.</b>

21:52.180 --> 21:53.800
<b>Gon and Knuckle.</b>

21:53.800 --> 21:56.270
<b>Killua and Shoot.</b>

21:56.270 --> 21:58.480
<b>Their final battle begins.</b>

23:25.880 --> 23:28.760
<b>Next time: Interest x And x Curse.</b>

23:28.760 --> 23:31.240
<b>Who are you calling slow, fool?</b>

23:31.240 --> 23:34.140
<b>Are you saying I'm cursed, fool?</b>
