01:19.711 --> 01:22.180
Hello, everybody.

01:22.247 --> 01:23.281
Hi, Sim.
              Ooh.

01:23.348 --> 01:25.483
Hello.
             Simka!

01:25.551 --> 01:27.418
You changed your
                    makeup, huh?

01:27.486 --> 01:30.288
Oh, thanks for noticing, Elaine.

01:30.356 --> 01:32.490
I got a new career.

01:32.557 --> 01:34.092
As a mime?

01:34.160 --> 01:38.463
No, Louie, I'm selling
    door-to-door cosmetics.

01:38.530 --> 01:41.833
And your sample case
     blew up in your face?

01:41.901 --> 01:43.934
Please, Louie!

01:44.002 --> 01:45.536
This is girl talk.

01:45.604 --> 01:47.439
Elaine...
             Oh...

01:47.507 --> 01:50.542
I'm now selling Shishka
                Flook Cosmetics.

01:50.610 --> 01:53.444
They're made in my homeland,
   and I bought the franchise

01:53.512 --> 01:58.016
to 18 states including
  the entire eastern seaboard.

01:58.084 --> 01:59.484
How could you
                    afford that?

01:59.551 --> 02:02.087
It cost six dollars.

02:02.154 --> 02:05.523
You want to see
      the catalog, Elaine?

02:05.591 --> 02:07.192
Okay, sure.

02:07.259 --> 02:09.461
Okay, good, now come on and
     hurry up and buy something,

02:09.527 --> 02:12.096
because I got a lot
          of territory to cover.

02:12.164 --> 02:13.831
Okay.

02:13.899 --> 02:15.033
Um...

02:15.101 --> 02:17.368
Okay, yeah, let me
   have some of this perfume.

02:17.436 --> 02:18.737
Oh, all right.

02:18.804 --> 02:21.706
Now, would you like a
      whole jar or a half a jar?

02:21.774 --> 02:23.141
Half a jar.

02:23.208 --> 02:24.708
Oh, that's a shame.

02:24.776 --> 02:27.378
With the whole jar,
    we throw in a free gift.

02:27.446 --> 02:28.813
Oh, what's that?

02:28.881 --> 02:30.681
The lid.

02:30.749 --> 02:32.917
A whole jar.

02:32.985 --> 02:34.085
All right.
                      Good girl.

02:34.152 --> 02:35.453
Here.

02:35.521 --> 02:36.788
How would you like
to be paid?

02:36.855 --> 02:40.091
Oh, very much.

02:40.159 --> 02:41.259
Okay.

02:41.327 --> 02:44.396
Simka, uh,
 when can I expect my delivery?

02:44.463 --> 02:45.897
Uh, eventually.

02:45.964 --> 02:47.298
Bye, all.

02:47.366 --> 02:48.966
Bye.
                 Good-bye.
          Bye.

02:56.742 --> 02:59.644
Congratulate me, folks.

03:00.813 --> 03:03.647
I bought something

03:03.715 --> 03:05.716
my brother says

03:05.784 --> 03:09.720
I've been needing
        for a <i>long</i> time.

03:09.788 --> 03:11.756
A brain?

03:11.824 --> 03:13.925
No, boss.

03:13.993 --> 03:15.326
I don't need a brain.

03:18.598 --> 03:21.833
I bought something

03:21.901 --> 03:23.868
my brother, Tom,

03:23.935 --> 03:27.071
says is a good investment

03:27.139 --> 03:29.240
for my inheritance money.

03:29.308 --> 03:31.976
All right, Jim,
what is it?

03:32.044 --> 03:33.611
A rare coin.

03:33.678 --> 03:34.813
Oh.

03:34.880 --> 03:38.183
A 1916

03:38.250 --> 03:41.452
Standing Liberty quarter

03:41.520 --> 03:43.788
worth $5,000.

03:43.856 --> 03:45.189
Ooh, nice, nice.
(whistles)

03:45.257 --> 03:46.791
Man.
                 Want to see it?

03:46.859 --> 03:47.959
Yeah.
Yes.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.215
Well, I guess I'd
              better savor this.

04:13.719 --> 04:16.320
Oh, no, Jim,
   you bought a cup of coffee

04:16.387 --> 04:18.255
with a $5,000 coin?

04:18.322 --> 04:21.858
Yeah. No cream, no sugar.

04:21.927 --> 04:23.127
Hey, listen.

04:23.195 --> 04:24.596
We got to get
       your quarter back.

04:24.663 --> 04:26.230
Yeah, uh...

04:26.298 --> 04:27.598
Yeah, if only that
were possible.

04:27.666 --> 04:29.533
Yeah, well, Louie
                    has the key.

04:29.601 --> 04:31.368
But I already had half the cup.

04:31.436 --> 04:33.137
ALEX:
                        Oh, Jim!

04:37.376 --> 04:39.444
I did it.

04:39.511 --> 04:41.513
I made a great
                     investment.

04:41.580 --> 04:44.148
No kidding, Jim? Hey,
            come here, sit down.

04:44.216 --> 04:47.051
Something I can enjoy

04:47.119 --> 04:48.786
while it goes up in value...

04:48.854 --> 04:50.788
according to my brother.

04:50.856 --> 04:52.023
Art?

04:52.090 --> 04:54.125
No. Tom.

04:56.295 --> 04:59.563
Hold on to your seats.

04:59.631 --> 05:02.667
I bought Mario's.

05:02.735 --> 05:04.402
Signed the papers this morning,

05:04.470 --> 05:06.637
and I've been running the place
          ever since.

05:06.705 --> 05:08.639
There you go, boss.

05:10.642 --> 05:13.578
Hey, Jim, uh,
why Mario's?

05:13.645 --> 05:16.814
You wouldn't believe what they
 were asking for Disney World.

05:18.951 --> 05:21.452
Jim, Mario's has been
    on the skids for years.

05:21.520 --> 05:24.255
I mean, mortuaries
   do better return business.

05:24.323 --> 05:27.558
Well, we have breakfast here
         every morning.

05:27.626 --> 05:29.627
We come here every night.

05:29.695 --> 05:32.730
Why do we come here
   if it's not a great place?

05:32.798 --> 05:34.365
It's next door
to the garage.

05:34.433 --> 05:38.703
So is the dry cleaners
    and we never eat there.

05:38.771 --> 05:40.104
Hey, boss, I forgot
                    to tell you,

05:40.172 --> 05:41.773
the guy dropped off the
       plans that you asked for.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.674
Oh, great.

05:43.742 --> 05:48.112
Wait till you guys see this.

05:48.180 --> 05:52.683
It's my vision
      of the new Mario's.

05:52.751 --> 05:57.755
There's gonna be lots
               of volcanic rock.

05:57.823 --> 06:02.060
Red lights and waterfalls
             all over the place.

06:02.128 --> 06:03.828
Right in the middle here,

06:03.896 --> 06:06.631
there's gonna be a little pond

06:06.698 --> 06:10.034
where a woman will play the harp

06:10.102 --> 06:12.837
on a swan shaped boat.

06:19.077 --> 06:22.213
Let's see that.

06:22.281 --> 06:23.781
PU!

06:24.883 --> 06:28.552
Yeah, it is a
                    little busy.

06:28.620 --> 06:31.122
Okay, so I made a false start.

06:31.190 --> 06:34.625
I'm still going
     to make Mario's great.

06:34.693 --> 06:37.394
Let's have a brainstorm.

06:37.462 --> 06:38.596
Tony?

06:38.664 --> 06:40.031
Um, I don't know.

06:40.098 --> 06:42.233
The best bars I've ever been in
had free peanuts.

06:42.301 --> 06:45.436
Oh, you should have a
         really good house wine.

06:45.504 --> 06:48.506
Good wine and free peanuts.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.808
Takes me back
to the good ol' days

06:50.876 --> 06:54.145
when I used to sleep
at the zoo.

06:55.247 --> 06:57.248
(groaning)

06:57.316 --> 06:59.617
Do you have any suggestions,
             Alex?

06:59.685 --> 07:01.586
Yeah, I think you
                should have, um,

07:01.653 --> 07:04.722
a lady playing the harp on a
     swan-shaped boat, you know?

07:04.790 --> 07:06.491
Oh, yeah?
                 No, no, no, no.

07:06.558 --> 07:10.027
I... I think instead you
            should have a piano.

07:10.095 --> 07:12.597
Wouldn't the boat sink?

07:12.665 --> 07:13.865
No, no, Jim, I mean...

07:13.932 --> 07:15.967
I mean,
in a corner someplace.

07:16.035 --> 07:18.168
Well, maybe we could
               put it over there

07:18.236 --> 07:20.138
by my brother, Tom.

07:22.875 --> 07:25.443
Tom!

07:25.511 --> 07:27.645
What are you doing here?

07:27.712 --> 07:31.115
I came to have a look
 at your so-called investment.

07:31.182 --> 07:32.517
Oh, that's great.

07:32.584 --> 07:35.953
I was just talking about
 what I should do to the place.

07:36.021 --> 07:38.356
I think it should be
           burned to the ground,

07:38.424 --> 07:40.458
the wreckage bulldozed,

07:40.526 --> 07:42.760
the ashes scattered
            and the earth salted

07:42.828 --> 07:45.864
so that nothing will ever
        grow on this spot again.

07:49.034 --> 07:51.636
Well, I think I'd like
to try free peanuts first.

07:54.573 --> 07:57.541
Come on, I'd like
to introduce you to my friends.

07:57.609 --> 07:58.709
Here, straighten
your tie, huh?

07:58.777 --> 07:59.844
Get your hands off.

08:03.181 --> 08:05.349
Tom, this is Tony.

08:05.417 --> 08:06.384
Hey, Tom.
                    How are you?

08:06.452 --> 08:07.552
How you doing?

08:07.619 --> 08:08.652
And Elaine.

08:08.720 --> 08:09.921
Hello.
                           Hi.

08:09.988 --> 08:11.088
And Alex.

08:11.156 --> 08:12.523
Yeah, I think we've met.

08:12.590 --> 08:13.858
Yes.

08:13.926 --> 08:16.927
I take it you think Jim
      made a mistake, huh?

08:16.995 --> 08:18.963
No, I think I
                 made a mistake.

08:19.031 --> 08:21.899
Well, you said you
          wanted responsibility.

08:21.967 --> 08:24.535
I said, "If you'd like to make
        an investment, go ahead.

08:24.603 --> 08:26.404
I'll let you make
                 an investment."

08:26.471 --> 08:28.839
And look at
                what you bought.

08:28.907 --> 08:33.376
No, no, Tom.
Don't rain on my parade.

08:33.445 --> 08:35.413
Let's have a toast.

08:35.480 --> 08:37.916
Yeah.
Yeah,
let's have one.

08:37.982 --> 08:39.450
Jim, you've
           squandered your money

08:39.518 --> 08:41.719
on the sleaziest
            dive I've ever seen.

08:41.787 --> 08:43.187
You're an immature,
                  irresponsible,

08:43.255 --> 08:44.922
childlike simpleton.

08:44.990 --> 08:46.757
Hear, hear!

08:51.096 --> 08:52.930
I don't think you want
       to drink to that.

08:52.998 --> 08:55.633
Oh, no, it's okay.

08:55.701 --> 08:58.002
You don't know
my brother, Tom.

08:58.070 --> 09:00.371
He's a pompous ass.

09:03.775 --> 09:05.343
Hey, Tom,
I'm telling you.

09:05.410 --> 09:06.744
This place might have
seen better days,

09:06.811 --> 09:08.245
but I think Jim
could make a go of it here.

09:08.313 --> 09:09.714
Yeah, why don't you
               give him a chance

09:09.782 --> 09:11.048
before you say
                 he's a failure?

09:11.116 --> 09:12.216
Yeah.

09:12.284 --> 09:13.750
Yeah, why don't you
give me a chance?

09:13.818 --> 09:15.285
I've only had it one day.

09:15.353 --> 09:17.021
What could I have done
in one day?

09:17.089 --> 09:19.490
Hello, Mr. Ignatowski.

09:19.558 --> 09:22.260
I'm Tracy Donovan with the
New York State Liquor Authority.

09:22.327 --> 09:25.129
I've been observing here
     for a couple of hours,

09:25.197 --> 09:29.500
and, in that time,
  I've seen three violations.

09:29.568 --> 09:31.168
Now I'm gonna
                  file a report,

09:31.236 --> 09:33.104
and I have to warn you

09:33.171 --> 09:34.772
that if you have
      one more violation,

09:34.840 --> 09:37.141
we'll close this place down.

09:44.216 --> 09:45.616
(door closes)

09:45.684 --> 09:48.753
Big shot.

09:48.821 --> 09:51.989
Well, Jim, I guess there's
  a lot you can do in one day.

09:52.057 --> 09:53.657
I've got to be more careful.

09:53.725 --> 09:56.027
I'm more responsible
        than you think.

09:56.095 --> 09:57.461
Come on, Jim,
   you wouldn't last a week.

09:57.529 --> 09:58.629
Oh, yeah?

09:58.697 --> 10:01.866
You come back here
      one week from today

10:01.934 --> 10:04.835
and you'll see this place
     crowded and successful

10:04.903 --> 10:07.671
and I'm gonna be the one
   who's responsible for it.

10:07.739 --> 10:08.773
All right.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.542
All right,
    I'll give you one week.

10:13.044 --> 10:14.979
(quietly):
    Bye, Tom.

10:19.918 --> 10:23.921
He's been doing this to me
    ever since we were kids.

10:25.023 --> 10:26.390
I sent away for a book

10:26.458 --> 10:28.792
on ventriloquism and he says,

10:28.860 --> 10:32.296
"You'll never learn
        how to do that."

10:32.364 --> 10:34.699
I said I was going out
          for the Little League,

10:34.766 --> 10:36.033
and he said,

10:36.101 --> 10:38.736
"You're wasting your time."

10:38.804 --> 10:43.173
I said I wanted to drive
    my bicycle off the roof.

10:43.241 --> 10:45.242
No.

10:45.310 --> 10:47.845
That time, he encouraged me.

10:49.614 --> 10:50.881
We're here to help you out.

10:50.949 --> 10:53.317
Come here. Come on, we
       got things to talk about.

11:00.259 --> 11:01.692
Hey, Jim.
What are you doing here?

11:01.760 --> 11:03.561
Just taking my dinner break.

11:03.628 --> 11:05.162
Why don't you eat
in your restaurant?

11:05.230 --> 11:06.764
I hate to eat alone.

11:06.832 --> 11:09.066
Aw. Is business
                      still bad?

11:09.134 --> 11:11.569
Ah, it's picking up a little.

11:11.636 --> 11:14.672
Today, some guy came in
     to use the telephone.

11:14.740 --> 11:18.943
He didn't have any ID,
      so I kicked him out.

11:19.010 --> 11:20.745
Well, better safe than sorry.

11:20.813 --> 11:23.614
Here, why don't you guys
            join me?

11:23.682 --> 11:27.084
I can't eat
    this whole thing myself.

11:27.152 --> 11:30.387
Jim, how come you can't eat
  that one piece by yourself?

11:30.455 --> 11:31.722
Because it's awful.

11:31.790 --> 11:34.025
I'm doing all the cooking now.

11:34.093 --> 11:35.460
What happened to the chef?
TONY:
Yeah?

11:35.527 --> 11:38.362
I had to let him go--
         he took drugs.

11:38.430 --> 11:40.063
Drugs? Are you sure?

11:40.131 --> 11:43.134
You know how when a man makes
     a pizza, he does this?

11:43.202 --> 11:44.301
Yeah.

11:44.369 --> 11:46.570
And he does this?
                           Yeah.
Yeah.

11:46.638 --> 11:48.840
And then he does this?
                       Yeah, so?
               Yeah.

11:48.907 --> 11:51.842
Well, I caught him doing that
         with the soup.

11:54.146 --> 11:57.047
My brother's right--
          I'm a flop,

11:57.115 --> 12:00.951
a failure, a zero.

12:01.019 --> 12:03.120
Jim, there are worms
                  on that pizza.

12:03.188 --> 12:04.388
Oh, it's all right.

12:04.456 --> 12:06.490
It's our Fisherman's Special.

12:08.927 --> 12:10.261
(clears throat)

12:10.328 --> 12:13.564
That's really Chinese noodles.

12:13.632 --> 12:16.634
I painted the little eyes on.

12:16.701 --> 12:18.836
It was either that or go crazy.

12:18.903 --> 12:21.739
Hey, Jim, Jim, I think
we can help you out.

12:21.807 --> 12:24.608
Great, 'cause I got another
       big can of noodles

12:24.676 --> 12:26.510
and a couple extra brushes.
                 No, no, no, no.

12:26.578 --> 12:29.013
I think between
the three of us

12:29.080 --> 12:30.648
we can suggest, uh, things

12:30.715 --> 12:32.283
to help you improve
                  your business.
    Yeah.

12:32.350 --> 12:33.884
Alex, I've tried everything:

12:33.952 --> 12:35.119
ads,

12:35.187 --> 12:37.888
drinks at half price.

12:37.956 --> 12:42.693
Well, why don't you try
     a wet T-shirt contest?

12:42.760 --> 12:44.195
I had one.

12:44.262 --> 12:47.665
The only contestant
   was a 400-pound ex-marine

12:47.732 --> 12:49.500
with a hairy chest.

12:49.568 --> 12:51.302
Interesting effect,

12:51.370 --> 12:53.571
but not enough to hold
        a supper crowd.

12:55.274 --> 12:58.976
I'm lucky my brother
    wasn't there that night.

12:59.044 --> 13:03.213
I'd rather he see an empty bar

13:03.281 --> 13:06.651
than people pelting me
       with dinner rolls.

13:06.718 --> 13:08.118
When's your
brother coming?

13:08.186 --> 13:09.820
Tonight.

13:09.888 --> 13:13.190
And when he does, he's gonna see

13:13.258 --> 13:15.359
one person in the bar:

13:15.427 --> 13:18.196
his dumb failure of a brother.

13:18.263 --> 13:19.530
Oh, no.

13:19.598 --> 13:20.965
Man, there's got to be something
we can do to help Jim.

13:21.032 --> 13:22.166
Come on.
                   Yeah.

13:22.233 --> 13:23.467
Well, what's the big fuss here?

13:23.534 --> 13:24.635
Oh, Jim's gonna
                   be humiliated

13:24.703 --> 13:26.070
in front of his brother.

13:26.137 --> 13:28.038
So what?
His brother's never

13:28.106 --> 13:29.907
gonna trust him with large
   amounts of money anymore.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.709
And rightly so.

13:31.776 --> 13:33.677
I mean, he's a goofball.

13:35.079 --> 13:37.481
Well, every cloud
      has a silver lining.

13:37.549 --> 13:39.049
At least you won't be able

13:39.117 --> 13:41.051
to sponge off him
anymore, Louie.

13:43.755 --> 13:45.690
Mm.

13:47.526 --> 13:48.792
Hey, all right.

13:48.860 --> 13:50.527
All right, listen
                  up, everybody.

13:50.595 --> 13:52.129
Listen up, all
                    you cabbies.

13:52.197 --> 13:53.764
Your mission tonight

13:53.832 --> 13:56.767
is to pack Mario's.

13:56.835 --> 14:00.571
Now, I want
           everybody to radio me

14:00.639 --> 14:02.006
as soon as you
                     get a fare.

14:02.074 --> 14:03.206
I don't care
                      who it is.

14:03.274 --> 14:04.775
I don't care where
                they want to go.

14:04.842 --> 14:06.944
They're gonna end up in Mario's.

14:07.011 --> 14:08.545
You leave it to me.

14:08.613 --> 14:09.914
(cabbies murmuring)

14:09.982 --> 14:11.115
All right,
                 come on. Nardo.

14:11.183 --> 14:12.716
Come on, 218...

14:12.784 --> 14:15.752
JIM:
       <i>Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.</i>

14:15.820 --> 14:18.789
Boy, I sure wish

14:18.857 --> 14:21.025
my brother would show up

14:21.093 --> 14:23.393
and ridicule me

14:23.461 --> 14:25.462
so I can go home.

14:28.967 --> 14:31.769
ELAINE:
         <i>Louie, I've got</i>
    <i>some out-of-towners here</i>

14:31.836 --> 14:33.871
who are interested
  in seeing some celebrities,

14:33.939 --> 14:35.473
and they want to go to Sardi's.

14:35.540 --> 14:37.708
LOUIE:
Well, drop 'em off quick, Nardo,

14:37.776 --> 14:39.443
because I need two cabs

14:39.511 --> 14:41.678
to pick up Brando
    and Olivier at Mario's.

14:41.746 --> 14:43.914
I can't put 'em in the same cab.

14:43.981 --> 14:45.182
You know how those guys are.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.184
Hey, Mario's.
      (excited chattering)

14:47.251 --> 14:48.419
Mario's?
Mario's.

14:48.487 --> 14:50.487
(laughter)

14:50.555 --> 14:52.490
<i>Louie, this is Alex.</i>

14:52.557 --> 14:54.458
I'm at Saint
            Patrick's Cathedral,

14:54.526 --> 14:56.627
and I've got a
             couple of, uh, nuns

14:56.695 --> 14:58.562
who want to go
                  to the movies.

14:58.629 --> 15:02.966
LOUIE:
  Ah, everything on the screen
      these days is filth.

15:03.034 --> 15:05.469
Might I suggest
       a pleasant evening

15:05.537 --> 15:07.938
of wholesome food at Mario's?

15:08.006 --> 15:12.543
If you like, I'll call ahead and
 reserve the Monsignor's table.

15:12.610 --> 15:16.413
Oh, what a nice man.

15:16.481 --> 15:18.682
Pray for him.

15:27.258 --> 15:29.092
(sighs)

15:29.160 --> 15:31.429
Well, Jim,

15:31.496 --> 15:32.796
you had your week.

15:32.864 --> 15:34.431
Looks like you failed.

15:34.499 --> 15:36.032
Do you have any excuses?

15:36.100 --> 15:38.068
Nope.

15:38.136 --> 15:40.938
Why don't you sit over
           there and have a beer

15:41.006 --> 15:43.107
while you gloat?

15:43.174 --> 15:45.208
Sure.

15:45.276 --> 15:47.177
Tommy, a beer for my brother.

15:47.245 --> 15:49.446
TOMMY:
               Right away, boss.

15:49.514 --> 15:51.515
Ah.

15:51.583 --> 15:53.951
Here you go, Jim,
                 some customers.

15:55.053 --> 15:57.788
Ah, welcome to Mario's.

15:57.856 --> 15:59.656
Do you have a reservation?

15:59.724 --> 16:01.025
Uh, no, Jim.

16:01.092 --> 16:02.192
They're friends of mine.

16:02.260 --> 16:03.461
Listen, uh...

16:03.528 --> 16:04.962
(clears throat)

16:05.030 --> 16:06.830
...all of the cabbies are
   bringing people here tonight,

16:06.898 --> 16:08.465
and, uh, some of
                 them are coming

16:08.533 --> 16:10.100
under sort of
                false pretenses,

16:10.168 --> 16:12.136
so, uh, play along
                with them, okay?

16:12.204 --> 16:14.138
Okeydoke.

16:18.743 --> 16:20.644
Here you go,
      sit right over here.

16:20.711 --> 16:23.514
Got a table all
                  ready for you.

16:23.582 --> 16:25.516
(Alex mumbles)

16:27.085 --> 16:29.920
We're here
    to see some celebrities.

16:29.988 --> 16:32.322
Oh, say, look here.

16:32.390 --> 16:34.625
Sally Field
        and Mary Martin.

16:37.495 --> 16:39.997
TONY:
                       Hey, Jim!

16:40.065 --> 16:41.298
Hey, come on in, guys.

16:41.366 --> 16:43.367
Hey, Jim, these guys came
all the way from Dubuque, Iowa,

16:43.435 --> 16:44.534
to see some
belly dancing.

16:44.602 --> 16:46.170
Have a good time, gents.
See you, Jimmy.

16:46.238 --> 16:48.739
Well, happy customers
  are the best advertisement.

16:48.806 --> 16:50.206
No, no, no, no...

16:52.744 --> 16:54.244
All right.

16:54.312 --> 16:56.079
Hey, uh,
                    we were told

16:56.147 --> 16:57.848
this place had
                    a piano bar.

16:57.915 --> 16:59.417
Oh, it certainly does,
and there it is.

16:59.484 --> 17:01.418
All right!
Have a seat.

17:01.485 --> 17:03.420
Thank you.

17:05.557 --> 17:06.890
Huh, well,

17:06.958 --> 17:08.992
those two were easy
                to take care of.

17:09.060 --> 17:10.227
Uh, Jim, I think
they're expecting

17:10.295 --> 17:12.662
to see somebody play
that piano.

17:12.730 --> 17:14.198
You think so?

17:14.265 --> 17:15.933
I'm almost sure of it.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.667
Well, you play
               piano, don't you?

17:17.734 --> 17:19.637
Yeah, I do,
but I'm not...

17:19.704 --> 17:21.204
Well, help me
              out, Alex, please.

17:21.272 --> 17:23.707
No, I can't play
in front of people. I can't.

17:23.775 --> 17:24.942
Just-Just tonight.
All right.

17:25.010 --> 17:26.175
All right, all right,
all right.

17:26.243 --> 17:28.078
I'll just play quietly,
a little background music,

17:28.146 --> 17:30.747
but, uh, I mean, I don't want to
   draw any attention to myself.

17:30.815 --> 17:32.616
I'm very shy in front
           of people, all right?

17:32.684 --> 17:33.917
Okeydoke.

17:35.219 --> 17:36.653
(clears throat)

17:36.721 --> 17:38.655
(clears throat)

17:40.792 --> 17:42.626
Ladies and gentlemen...

17:42.693 --> 17:43.993
Jim!

17:44.061 --> 17:45.796
No, no. Jim, no, no.

17:45.864 --> 17:48.799
Jim's Mario's is proud
           to present

17:48.867 --> 17:52.770
for your musical
entertainment,

17:52.838 --> 17:54.371
America's premier balladeer...

17:54.439 --> 17:55.539
Jim, please.

17:55.606 --> 17:56.973
...the one and only
          Alex Reiger.

17:57.041 --> 17:58.576
Jim, Jim,
                       Jim, Jim!
All right!

17:58.643 --> 17:59.777
Yay!

17:59.844 --> 18:01.645
I told you,
                      I'm not...

18:01.713 --> 18:03.013
Jim, there is no way
  you're gonna get me to sing

18:03.080 --> 18:04.681
in front of these people.

18:04.749 --> 18:05.850
(whistles, applause,
         and cheering)

18:05.917 --> 18:07.017
Closing time, folks!

18:07.085 --> 18:08.452
No!
        (crowd groaning)

18:08.519 --> 18:10.287
Okay, that's all
      for tonight, folks.

18:10.354 --> 18:11.622
Good night.

18:11.690 --> 18:12.990
(crowd groaning)

18:13.057 --> 18:14.257
JIM:
                   That's right.

18:14.325 --> 18:15.425
Time to go home.

18:15.493 --> 18:16.593
(crowd groaning)

18:16.661 --> 18:17.761
No, no, no, no.

18:17.828 --> 18:19.029
We do have laws.

18:19.097 --> 18:21.665
You can stay, and I can
        serve you another drink,

18:21.732 --> 18:23.600
and they'll
                  close me down.

18:23.668 --> 18:25.803
(crowd groaning)
                          Sorry.

18:25.870 --> 18:27.804
Bye.

18:29.607 --> 18:31.708
I'm gonna tell all of my friends
       about this place.

18:31.776 --> 18:33.711
You really know how
  to make people feel welcome.

18:33.778 --> 18:34.878
Okay.

18:34.946 --> 18:37.014
MAN:
                  Should be open
            seven nights a week.

18:37.082 --> 18:38.315
JIM:
              I'm working on it.

18:38.383 --> 18:40.317
Ah, boy.

18:40.384 --> 18:42.820
Thanks, you guys.

18:42.887 --> 18:45.588
Tonight was a dream
come true.

18:45.656 --> 18:47.491
And I owe it all
to you.

18:47.558 --> 18:48.792
Oh, it was our pleasure.

18:48.859 --> 18:50.027
You ain't kidding.

18:50.095 --> 18:51.261
Good night, Jim.

18:51.329 --> 18:52.663
Good night.
Oh, thanks, Tony.

18:52.730 --> 18:53.830
All right.
                        Come on.

18:53.898 --> 18:55.265
ALEX:
Oh, Jim, Jim.

18:55.333 --> 18:56.500
What a night.

18:56.568 --> 18:58.435
What a night!
                    Ah!

19:00.104 --> 19:01.538
Hey, Jim, did
                  you ever think

19:01.606 --> 19:04.040
of adding a couple of
        drums and a bass player?

19:04.108 --> 19:05.476
I love it.
I love it.

19:05.543 --> 19:07.144
I knew you would.
                    I'm so glad.

19:07.212 --> 19:09.113
Good night.
Good night, Alex.

19:14.819 --> 19:16.320
Jim?

19:16.387 --> 19:17.754
Huh?

19:19.323 --> 19:21.859
I'm glad you proved me wrong.

19:21.926 --> 19:24.494
I'd like to shake your hand.

19:24.562 --> 19:27.164
Tom, I'm glad

19:27.231 --> 19:30.300
I proved you wrong, too.

19:30.368 --> 19:32.836
I want to give
                  you a big hug.

19:32.904 --> 19:34.204
All right.

19:34.272 --> 19:36.339
All right, brother.

19:37.975 --> 19:39.709
Listen, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna get my coat,

19:39.777 --> 19:42.146
and then
I'll-I'll drive you home, okay?

19:42.213 --> 19:43.380
Okay.

19:43.448 --> 19:45.949
(laughs)

19:49.554 --> 19:51.488
(sighs)

19:54.058 --> 19:58.562
Hey, you-- you're the owner
       here, aren't you?

19:58.630 --> 20:01.498
That's right.

20:01.566 --> 20:04.534
I want you to know
that I had

20:04.602 --> 20:08.138
a very, very good time tonight.

20:08.206 --> 20:09.739
Thanks. I'm glad you did.

20:09.807 --> 20:11.174
I'm glad you did.

20:11.242 --> 20:13.443
And say, I was...
      I was wondering, uh,

20:13.511 --> 20:18.015
if you could sell me a bottle
    of brandy to take home?

20:18.083 --> 20:19.817
Ah, sorry.

20:19.884 --> 20:22.953
It's against the law.

20:23.021 --> 20:24.354
Well, that's true, but,

20:24.422 --> 20:26.990
see, I just got off the phone
        with my mother,

20:27.058 --> 20:31.227
and she's got arthritis,
 and it's really bothering her,

20:31.295 --> 20:34.665
and I know
     the brandy would help.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.266
I'm sorry.

20:36.334 --> 20:39.269
The Liquor Authority told me

20:39.337 --> 20:42.339
that if I had
      one more violation,

20:42.407 --> 20:44.407
they'd close me down.

20:44.475 --> 20:46.109
Please?!

20:46.176 --> 20:48.946
Look, there's nobody here
        but you and me.

20:49.013 --> 20:51.848
You'd only be bending the law
       just a little bit,

20:51.916 --> 20:54.718
and you'd really be helping
         my mother out.

20:57.321 --> 21:00.557
(sighs and
                       sputters)

21:02.327 --> 21:04.261
All right.

21:20.144 --> 21:22.245
Here you go.

21:22.313 --> 21:24.515
Mr. Ignatowski,

21:24.582 --> 21:26.383
I'm an undercover agent

21:26.451 --> 21:29.118
with the New York
Liquor Authority.

21:29.186 --> 21:31.755
This is your fourth violation
          in one week.

21:31.823 --> 21:34.757
I'm afraid we're gonna have
       to close you down.

21:34.825 --> 21:37.060
TOM:
Ah, no, Jim.

21:37.128 --> 21:39.329
Jim, you're hopeless.

21:39.397 --> 21:41.965
I thought for once in your life
      you'd finally manage

21:42.032 --> 21:44.367
to not screw things up.

21:44.435 --> 21:45.769
I wanted to believe in you,

21:45.836 --> 21:47.871
but this just proves
that you're a failure,

21:47.939 --> 21:49.272
and you're gonna stay

21:49.340 --> 21:50.974
a failure your entire life.

21:53.078 --> 21:56.879
Can I say one word
         in my defense?

22:02.853 --> 22:04.821
Seltzer.

22:11.829 --> 22:14.297
Now get out of here.

22:14.365 --> 22:17.834
And you tell the guys

22:17.902 --> 22:20.270
down at the
                Liquor Authority

22:20.338 --> 22:22.905
that I'm a man
to be reckoned with!

22:25.543 --> 22:28.478
Oh.

22:28.545 --> 22:33.684
How many times can I
    apologize to you in one day?

22:33.751 --> 22:35.652
I never get tired
of hearing it.

22:35.719 --> 22:36.887
(laughs)

22:36.955 --> 22:39.189
Let's go home. Come on.

22:39.257 --> 22:41.424
All right.

22:43.861 --> 22:46.163
(sighs)

22:47.698 --> 22:48.998
TOM:
Here, uh,

22:49.066 --> 22:51.501
straighten your tie.

22:51.569 --> 22:52.869
(Jim laughs)

22:52.937 --> 22:54.037
Come on.

22:54.105 --> 22:56.039
Okay.

23:09.320 --> 23:12.989
(theme song playing)

23:33.744 --> 23:35.211
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

23:35.279 --> 23:36.613
(man grumbling)

23:37.305 --> 23:43.292
