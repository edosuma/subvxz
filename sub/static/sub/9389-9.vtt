00:13.013 --> 00:16.141
(SINGING)
It seems today that all you see

00:16.225 --> 00:19.603
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:19.686 --> 00:23.190
But where are those
Good old-fashioned values

00:23.273 --> 00:26.151
ALL: On which we used to rely?

00:26.235 --> 00:29.404
Lucky there's a family guy

00:29.488 --> 00:32.991
Lucky there's a man who positively can do

00:33.075 --> 00:34.576
All the things that make us

00:34.660 --> 00:35.994
Laugh and cry

00:36.245 --> 00:41.416
ALL: He's a family guy!

00:46.088 --> 00:49.341
Okay, Peter, I'm off to my book club.
You'll babysit Stewie?

00:49.675 --> 00:52.469
-Only if I can have a "posicle."
-Only if you say it right.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.930
Pop... Sicle.

00:55.347 --> 00:57.641
Good. And you better
be responsible tonight.

00:57.724 --> 01:01.395
I don't want a repeat of the last time
I left you alone with one of our children.

01:01.562 --> 01:05.357
(SOBBING) Oh, it's just so horrible.

01:05.649 --> 01:07.442
I'm sorry, Lois.

01:07.526 --> 01:10.362
I thought if I shook him enough,
he'd stop crying.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.657
I was kinda right.

01:16.451 --> 01:20.080
Yeah, I'm babysitting for Stewie.
I babysit now 'cause I'm growin' up.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.249
I am so getting hair down there.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.585
Anyway, you guys should totally come over.

01:24.668 --> 01:27.546
What? You're already here?
No way!

01:27.629 --> 01:29.214
(BOTH YELL)

01:32.551 --> 01:34.386
Okay, Quagmire's turn.
Truth or dare?

01:34.469 --> 01:36.638
Uh, I pick dare.
No, no, no, truth, truth.

01:36.722 --> 01:38.849
Okay, truth. Do you have AIDS?

01:38.932 --> 01:41.727
Ah, come on. We're all just
trying to have a good time.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.188
Okay, Cleveland, your turn.
Truth or dare?

01:44.271 --> 01:45.480
Um... Dare.

01:45.564 --> 01:49.484
Okay. I dare you to make out
with Joe for 15 seconds.

01:49.568 --> 01:51.653
-What?
-No way! Ew! Ew!

01:51.737 --> 01:52.905
You gotta. It's a dare.

01:53.030 --> 01:54.364
-That's the game.
-That's the game.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.617
Okay, what the hell?
I'm an open-minded person.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.536
-So am I. No big deal.
-It's just my body.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.414
-Oh, my God, they're gonna do it!
-Oh, I gotta take a picture!

02:02.706 --> 02:04.625
-(MOANS)
-Holy crap! No way!

02:04.708 --> 02:07.085
-Oh, they're doing it! They're doing it!
-No freakin' way! Oh, my God!

02:07.169 --> 02:08.295
-Oh, my God, they're doing it.
-Quagmire, take a picture!

02:08.378 --> 02:10.631
Ah! Oh, my God! (LAUGHS)

02:11.173 --> 02:15.093
Hey! Keep it down!
It's just two guys making out! Relax!

02:15.177 --> 02:16.386
Stewie, go to bed!

02:16.470 --> 02:20.599
What, am I expected to put myself to bed?
Is no one taking care of me?

02:20.682 --> 02:24.311
Ugh! He's a worse dad than a rich
New York City investment banker.

02:24.561 --> 02:27.856
Hi, Daddy! At school today,
they picked one kid to...

02:27.940 --> 02:29.525
Millie, it's in here again.

02:29.608 --> 02:30.984
(IN JAMAICAN ACCENT) Me sorry, Mr. Sir.

02:31.068 --> 02:33.445
Get out da room, dem der,
you bodder you father.

02:33.529 --> 02:35.656
Him unhappy him had you
in the first place.

02:36.240 --> 02:39.660
Now, come on, I'll let you
rub some lotion on me elbows.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.828
ANNOUNCER: We now return to Robert Mitchum

02:41.912 --> 02:44.957
in Out-of-Shape-In-Shape Guy
From the '50s.

02:45.624 --> 02:47.835
Gambling is illegal in this town.

02:47.918 --> 02:50.087
-Says who?
-Says me.

02:50.170 --> 02:54.132
-You got a problem with that?
-I'm not really sure.

02:54.216 --> 02:55.968
Kinda waiting for you to exhale.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.636
(EXHALES)

02:57.886 --> 02:59.721
Actually, yeah,
I do havea problem with that.

03:00.848 --> 03:05.060
Oh, come on! Stupid satellite TV!
Maybe I have to fix the dish.

03:08.647 --> 03:10.023
Uh-oh.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.483
(GRUNTING)

03:11.567 --> 03:12.776
Oh, no. Oh, no.

03:13.068 --> 03:15.362
Hey! Hey! Help! Help!

03:18.323 --> 03:20.534
Hey! Hey, Brian! Brian!

03:20.826 --> 03:22.494
-What the hell?
-Call the fire brigade!

03:22.578 --> 03:23.787
Get a ladder! Get me down!

03:23.996 --> 03:25.122
What are you doing up there?

03:25.289 --> 03:26.874
Counting the stars in Orion's penis!

03:26.957 --> 03:28.876
What do you think I'm doing up here?
I'm stuck!

03:29.084 --> 03:30.210
How did you get on the roof?

03:30.294 --> 03:33.255
What am I doing, an interview?
Shut up and get a ladder or something!

03:33.463 --> 03:35.257
Actually, yeah.
Maybe we are doing an interview.

03:35.340 --> 03:38.010
So, Stewie, tell us about that
new project you have coming up.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.928
What are you talking about?
Get me down, you douche!

03:40.095 --> 03:42.181
No, first you tell me
about that new project.

03:42.264 --> 03:43.599
Oh, you're so dead!

03:43.682 --> 03:44.766
Is that the title of your new film?

03:44.850 --> 03:45.976
(GROWLS ANGRILY)

03:46.059 --> 03:49.062
Um, I've been working on a new movie,
and it's really great. Toss me a rope!

03:49.146 --> 03:51.273
No, that's not good enough.
I want details.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.525
I'm gonna slit your
throat in your sleep!

03:53.609 --> 03:56.361
Um, well, uh, when you're
working with Jack Black,

03:56.570 --> 03:58.572
uh, you just got to keep up, you know?

03:58.655 --> 04:00.115
I mean, he's doing his thing

04:00.199 --> 04:01.950
and you've gotta, you gotta
match his energy level

04:02.284 --> 04:04.203
without looking like you're
trying to one-up him,

04:04.286 --> 04:06.288
'cause, you know, that's a game
you're just not gonna win!

04:06.371 --> 04:08.624
What was it like having
the privilege of performing

04:08.707 --> 04:10.959
the words of Oscar winner
Diablo Cody?

04:11.043 --> 04:13.462
She's an overpriced call girl
who got lucky once!

04:13.879 --> 04:16.173
Ooh, that doesn't sound
like an interview answer.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.342
Say something nice about Diablo Cody.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.595
I envy the tattoo artist

04:21.678 --> 04:25.057
who had that huge canvas
of arm fat to work with.

04:25.307 --> 04:27.684
(LAUGHS) Wonderful. Wonderful.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.311
Hey listen,
can you hang with us through the break?

04:29.394 --> 04:30.395
What?

04:30.479 --> 04:32.648
We'll be right back with
Stewie's costar Robin Williams.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.526
No, no, I hate Robin Wi...
Where are you going?

04:35.609 --> 04:37.027
(THUNDER CRASHES)

04:37.945 --> 04:39.988
-Stewie!
-What?

04:40.072 --> 04:43.033
I have to tell you about the future!

04:43.242 --> 04:47.329
-What?
-I have to tell you about the future!

04:47.704 --> 04:49.790
On the night I go back...

04:49.873 --> 04:51.166
Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no.

04:51.250 --> 04:54.044
Hang on, Michael.
I have to tell you about your future.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.588
Peter, Stewie's on the roof.

04:57.172 --> 04:59.842
Oh, Nick Jonas is so cute.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.385
-Hey, Peter?
-Yeah?

05:01.593 --> 05:04.304
-Pillow fight!
-Ow! You bastard!

05:04.388 --> 05:06.181
(ALL GIGGLING)

05:08.892 --> 05:10.894
(ANGRY GRUNTING)

05:20.112 --> 05:22.698
-Ahh!
-Oh, my God, sorry, Lois!

05:22.781 --> 05:26.660
Peter, what is our infant son
doing up on the roof?

05:27.160 --> 05:28.745
STEWIE: There's a raccoon up here!

05:29.037 --> 05:30.956
Yikes! Looks like I need a distraction.

05:31.582 --> 05:34.042
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Conway Twitty.

05:34.543 --> 05:36.795
(COUNTRY BALLAD PLAYING)

05:45.637 --> 05:50.267
(SINGING)
I see the sparkling little diamond

05:50.350 --> 05:53.812
On your hand

05:55.772 --> 05:57.733
It's plain to see

05:57.816 --> 06:04.198
That you've already got a man

06:05.657 --> 06:10.913
And I can tell you're not about to fall

06:11.330 --> 06:16.084
For any of my lies

06:16.793 --> 06:23.133
I see the "want to" in your eyes

06:25.636 --> 06:27.971
Deep in your smile

06:28.055 --> 06:32.351
There's a quiet soft desire

06:32.726 --> 06:35.604
Ooh-ooh

06:35.687 --> 06:37.898
Like the ember

06:38.148 --> 06:42.819
Of a once-raging fire

06:42.903 --> 06:45.364
Ooh-ooh

06:45.447 --> 06:50.536
You know I could light that fire again

06:50.911 --> 06:56.041
You know it isn't wise

06:57.209 --> 07:03.549
I see the "want to" in your eyes

07:06.718 --> 07:10.556
How strong is a band of gold?

07:11.348 --> 07:15.227
Is it strong enough to hold

07:15.853 --> 07:19.481
When a love has grown cold

07:19.565 --> 07:23.610
And a woman wants a love

07:24.194 --> 07:27.281
Sweet and warm?

07:28.407 --> 07:32.661
How many women just like you

07:33.036 --> 07:36.498
Have silent schemes?

07:36.582 --> 07:38.292
Ooh-ooh

07:38.375 --> 07:43.005
How many men like me do they sleep with

07:43.422 --> 07:46.258
In their dreams?

07:46.341 --> 07:48.177
Ooh-ooh

07:48.260 --> 07:52.514
You can stay or you can go

07:52.806 --> 07:58.061
And although I sympathize

07:59.188 --> 08:05.402
I see the "want to" in your eyes

08:08.947 --> 08:15.120
I see the "want to" in your eyes.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.251
-(SONG ENDS)
-(APPLAUSE)

08:21.835 --> 08:23.962
Terrific. Terrific.

08:24.463 --> 08:26.715
So, Lois, you still pissed at me
about Stewie being on the roof?

08:26.840 --> 08:28.217
Yes, Peter, I am.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.802
Well, for cryin' out loud,
if Conway Twitty isn't enough

08:30.886 --> 08:32.596
to lighten you up,
what more is it gonna take?

08:32.679 --> 08:34.723
A Minotaur with Sean Connery's head?

08:34.806 --> 08:36.683
-(DOORBELL RINGS)
-(SIGHS)

08:38.060 --> 08:39.937
CONNERY'S VOICE:
Is this 31 Spooner Street?

08:40.020 --> 08:42.147
Get outta here!
Just get the hell outta here!

08:42.231 --> 08:43.941
(HOOVES CLOPPING AWAY)

08:45.192 --> 08:47.903
Look, Lois, what do you say
we just bury the hatchet, huh?

08:47.986 --> 08:51.240
We'll stay in tonight, pop some popcorn
and watch Jimmy Kimmel try.

08:51.323 --> 08:54.952
No, thank you, Peter.
And even if I wanted to, the TV's out.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.954
There must be something wrong
with the dish.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.039
It's all right, it's all right,
I'll fix the dish.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.707
Where's my screwdriver?

09:01.375 --> 09:03.252
Holy crap.

09:03.335 --> 09:05.796
You are not gonna believe
what I just found.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.381
A yellow piece of paper?

09:07.464 --> 09:10.926
A raffle ticket, Brian,
but not just any raffle ticket.

09:11.009 --> 09:14.429
I won this in 1989 from a Honey
Nut Cheerios sweepstakes,

09:14.513 --> 09:16.181
and I totally forgot to cash it in.

09:16.265 --> 09:18.809
It's one free round of golf
with a famous celebrity.

09:19.142 --> 09:21.186
Wow. Who's the celebrity?

09:21.520 --> 09:23.689
I'll give you a hint:
famous football player,

09:23.772 --> 09:25.440
had a bit part in Roots,

09:25.524 --> 09:27.943
a couple of great scenes
in The Towering Inferno.

09:28.026 --> 09:29.778
-Wait a minute.
-Chuck Connors?

09:29.862 --> 09:31.989
He was a basketball player,
and he was in Roots.

09:32.114 --> 09:34.741
Yeah, he wasn't in The Towering Inferno,
you dumb beaver.

09:34.825 --> 09:37.536
What? I didn't say nothin'!

09:37.828 --> 09:39.913
-Dad, who is it?
-O.J. Simpson.

09:41.290 --> 09:42.666
Who's that?

09:42.791 --> 09:45.460
O.J. Simpson on Spooner Street?

09:45.544 --> 09:48.422
Now that's a story
I can sink my teeth into.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.507
Stick around!

09:55.846 --> 09:57.639
Peter, why in the world

09:57.723 --> 10:00.809
would you want to play golf
with O.J. Simpson?

10:00.893 --> 10:02.895
Why not, Lois? He's the Juice!

10:02.978 --> 10:04.771
One of the greatest
football players ever!

10:04.855 --> 10:06.356
Peter, he murdered two people.

10:07.399 --> 10:08.442
What?

10:08.525 --> 10:11.069
He brutally killed his ex-wife,
Nicole Brown Simpson,

10:11.153 --> 10:12.654
and her friend, Ron Goldman.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.781
-O.J. Simpson?
-Yes!

10:14.865 --> 10:16.074
Was this in the news?

10:16.158 --> 10:18.285
Yes, Peter.
It was all over the news.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.287
Well, now wait a minute,
if he killed two people,

10:20.370 --> 10:21.538
how come he's not in jail?

10:21.622 --> 10:22.748
He was acquitted.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.333
Oh, well, there you go.
Everything's fine.

10:24.416 --> 10:27.544
Well, Peter, it's generally believed
that the jury made a mistake.

10:27.628 --> 10:30.214
You're saying all those guys
in their powdery wigs

10:30.297 --> 10:33.467
and their Pilgrim hats and their big,
gross wives were wrong?

10:33.675 --> 10:37.179
Man, they'd have to be stupider than
you are when you fart yourself awake.

10:37.554 --> 10:40.390
(FARTS) Hello? What the... What...
Who's there? What's goin' on?

10:42.100 --> 10:44.102
Whatever's happening here...

10:44.520 --> 10:46.146
Just knock it off.

10:50.901 --> 10:55.113
So I, Peter Griffin, will be playing
one free round of golf tomorrow

10:55.197 --> 10:57.658
with the one and only O.J. Simpson.

10:57.741 --> 11:00.994
What? Peter, you can't play
golf with O.J. Simpson.

11:01.078 --> 11:03.664
-He's a murderer!
-Oh, you sound just like Lois.

11:03.747 --> 11:05.874
-No, no, Joe, I don't believe you.
-Oh, yeah?

11:05.958 --> 11:07.835
Well, say that after
a soul-searching walk

11:07.918 --> 11:10.170
around town to "Dust In The Wind."

11:10.671 --> 11:15.217
(SINGING)
I close my eyes

11:15.884 --> 11:19.805
Only for a moment
And the moment's gone

11:21.014 --> 11:24.935
All my dreams

11:26.061 --> 11:29.898
Pass before my eyes a curiosity

11:31.775 --> 11:35.028
Dust in the wind

11:36.280 --> 11:39.741
All they are is dust in the wind.

11:41.159 --> 11:44.830
Oh, my God, Joe, you're right!
O.J. Simpson is a murderer!

11:44.913 --> 11:47.374
What am I gonna do?
I'm playing golf with him tomorrow!

11:47.499 --> 11:49.418
Well, now, wait a minute, Peter.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.670
This may be an unprecedented opportunity.

11:51.795 --> 11:54.464
Maybe you could wear a wire,
get O.J. to confess,

11:54.548 --> 11:56.091
and we could tape the whole thing.

11:56.175 --> 11:57.926
Wow, imagine it.

11:58.010 --> 12:00.762
Peter Griffin,
the guy who took down O.J.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.473
Marcia Clark sure couldn't do it,
that dumb beaver.

12:03.599 --> 12:05.684
Hey, I wasn't even there.

12:05.767 --> 12:08.645
I was building
a Canadian dam at the time.

12:08.729 --> 12:11.523
Did you know that beavers
affect their ecosystem

12:11.607 --> 12:13.400
more than any other animal?

12:13.483 --> 12:16.111
-Except man.
-(LAUGHS)

12:16.195 --> 12:17.779
He was in our house earlier.

12:20.866 --> 12:22.576
Now, remember, Peter, we're gonna be

12:22.659 --> 12:24.786
right here in the van
if anything goes wrong.

12:24.870 --> 12:27.372
Just try to get O.J.
talking about the murders.

12:27.456 --> 12:30.709
Do you think he'd be offended
if I asked him to sign this basketball?

12:30.792 --> 12:32.294
Yeah, I think he'd be very offended.

12:32.377 --> 12:33.545
Oh.

12:35.172 --> 12:37.925
-All right Joe, can you hear me?
-JOE: Loud and clear, Peter.

12:42.846 --> 12:44.556
Hi. Are you Peter Griffin?

12:44.640 --> 12:48.769
-That's my name, don't put a knife in it.
-Nice to meet you. Come on, let's tee off.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.731
Damn it,
will you look at these golf shoes?

12:52.814 --> 12:54.233
They're all scuffed up.

12:54.608 --> 12:57.736
My wife was supposed to polish them,
but clearly she forgot.

12:58.028 --> 13:01.615
Man, sometimes I just feel like
I could just stab her repeatedly.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.617
(SCOFFS) White women, huh?

13:03.909 --> 13:05.536
Jewish waiters, too.

13:05.619 --> 13:08.664
I got this Jewish waiter one time,
he was awful. Didn't tip him.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.666
You, uh, you ever do anything
bad to a Jewish waiter?

13:10.916 --> 13:13.794
What's that, Peter?
I'm sorry, I was focusing on my drive.

13:13.877 --> 13:16.755
You're doing great, Peter.
Just don't let him intimidate you.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.090
Guys, guys.

13:18.173 --> 13:19.800
Someone's getting frogged
in the clubhouse.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.677
-Quagmire!
-She sounds fat.

13:23.345 --> 13:25.430
Hey, you know what I like
to do sometimes, Juice?

13:25.514 --> 13:27.975
I like to just confess things
I've done to people.

13:28.058 --> 13:29.643
You know?
Just clear my conscience.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.603
Makes me feel a whole lot better.

13:31.728 --> 13:34.523
-Anything you'd like to confess?
-No, not really.

13:34.690 --> 13:36.608
JOE: Peter, we're not really
hearing him very well.

13:36.692 --> 13:38.151
Can you get closer?

13:39.111 --> 13:41.572
Um, are you sure, O.J.?

13:41.655 --> 13:43.657
Are you sure you wouldn't
like to confess

13:43.740 --> 13:46.285
to the murders of Nicole Brown
Simpson and Ron Goldman?

13:46.451 --> 13:47.995
-What?
-(MICROPHONE FEEDBACK)

13:48.245 --> 13:49.496
What the hell is that?

13:49.580 --> 13:51.290

13:51.373 --> 13:53.125
-(ENGINE REVVING)
-(TIRES SCREECHING)

13:53.208 --> 13:55.752
-I am so murdered.
-Peter, I'm hurt.

13:55.961 --> 13:57.504
How could you deceive me like this?

13:57.629 --> 13:59.756
Oh, God, O.J., please don't kill me!

13:59.840 --> 14:01.425
Wait a minute.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.428
Is this about that
whole business back in 1994?

14:04.511 --> 14:06.388
-Well, yeah.
-Darn it.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.849
That's been chasing me for 13 years.

14:09.266 --> 14:12.311
And here I was, looking forward
to a nice day of golf,

14:12.519 --> 14:15.314
away from all those people
who have demonized me

14:15.397 --> 14:17.524
and made me out to be
some kind of boogey man,

14:17.608 --> 14:20.652
even though I was found innocent
by a jury of my peers.

14:20.736 --> 14:22.404
But what about the civil trial?

14:22.487 --> 14:24.990
Believe me, Peter,
there was nothing civil about it.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.533
(LAUGHS)

14:26.617 --> 14:28.619
Well, that makes up for one murder!

14:28.702 --> 14:31.955
The only thing I'm guilty
of is a few bad movies.

14:32.039 --> 14:34.958
And that makes up for the other murder.
I am sold.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.085
You are so witty and charming.

14:37.169 --> 14:39.129
That's nice of you to say, Peter.

14:39.588 --> 14:42.090
It's been so long since I've had a friend.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.968
(SOBBING)

14:45.844 --> 14:47.471
You poor fella.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.723
Gosh, there's no way
you could've killed anybody.

14:49.806 --> 14:51.475
Not with those sad eyes.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.311
I'm gonna make sure
everything's gonna be all right.

14:54.978 --> 14:58.106
Hey, everybody, look who I brought home.

14:58.357 --> 15:01.652
10,000 rushing yards, six pro bowls,
two arrests and no convictions.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.779
-Orenthal James Simpson!
-Hi, Griffins.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.155
-Oh, my God.
-BRIAN: What the...

15:05.239 --> 15:06.573
I just think you're terrific.

15:11.620 --> 15:14.164
O.J., this is my family.
Family, O.J.

15:14.248 --> 15:15.874
It's nice to meet you all.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.793
Hey, Peter,
you mind if I use your restroom?

15:17.876 --> 15:19.753
No, it's upstairs and to the left.

15:19.837 --> 15:21.713
Peter, are you out of your mind

15:21.797 --> 15:23.674
bringing O.J. Simpson into our home?

15:23.757 --> 15:25.759
Look, don't make that
face at me, Lois.

15:25.843 --> 15:27.094
O.J. is innocent, all right?

15:27.177 --> 15:29.263
-Peter, we know he did it.
-Oh, you were there?

15:29.346 --> 15:30.472
Oh, I didn't realize that.

15:30.556 --> 15:32.057
Oh, and you didn't do
anything to stop it?

15:32.140 --> 15:33.141
Oh, accessory to murder!

15:33.225 --> 15:35.018
Why are you so quick to defend this guy?

15:35.102 --> 15:37.437
Because he was a childhood hero, Brian.

15:37.855 --> 15:41.066
Yes, he had a few marital problems,
but I... I used to look up to him.

15:41.149 --> 15:44.069
That's it, isn't it?
You idolized O.J. Simpson as a boy,

15:44.152 --> 15:46.822
and you just can't accept the fact
that he's not who you thought he was.

15:46.989 --> 15:48.407
All right, enough with the yappity-yap.

15:48.490 --> 15:50.659
O.J. is gonna stay here
with us in Quahog

15:50.742 --> 15:52.911
until I can help him
get his life back on track.

15:56.999 --> 16:00.544
-Hi, Lois.
-(GASPS) Oh. Hello, O.J.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.546
Anything I can do to help make dinner?

16:02.629 --> 16:06.341
Um, sure.
You can take the lasagna out of the oven.

16:06.425 --> 16:07.634
You got it.

16:10.512 --> 16:13.015
Oh, wouldn't you know it?
It won't fit.

16:13.307 --> 16:15.684
Well, it's all right. How hot can it be?

16:16.643 --> 16:21.815
Ah, ooh, ooh, ow, ow, ow!
Aw, Lois, I'm so sorry!

16:21.899 --> 16:24.818
Oh, it's all right, O.J.
Let me get something to clean that up.

16:24.985 --> 16:26.570
-(GRUNTS)
-(SCREAMS)

16:26.653 --> 16:29.323
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-Brian, what's the matter?

16:29.406 --> 16:31.533
(SIGHS) Oh. Oh, you're alive.

16:31.617 --> 16:33.702
Yeah, we just had
a little pasta spill.

16:33.911 --> 16:36.079
Oh, thank God. (SIGHS)

16:36.163 --> 16:37.915
It's okay, Brian.

16:37.998 --> 16:40.209
It's not the first accident
we've had in this house.

16:40.626 --> 16:44.129
Okay, one, two...
Oh, uh, hang on, hang on, Brian.

16:44.213 --> 16:46.340
Stop the wheel, stop the wheel. I BM'd.

16:46.882 --> 16:48.133
Hey, Juice.

16:48.217 --> 16:49.468
Is it all right
if I call you Juice? Great.

16:49.551 --> 16:51.803
Listen, I was wondering if you
could give me a little advice

16:51.887 --> 16:53.639
on how to murder a woman
and get away with it.

16:53.722 --> 16:54.932
Aw, cool, look at that.

16:55.349 --> 16:56.683
Hey, Chris, go long!

16:57.184 --> 16:58.602
(SCREAMING)

16:59.478 --> 17:01.813
-(GRUNTS)
-Touchdown!

17:02.314 --> 17:03.815
Good grief.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.151
What are you doing, O.J.?

17:06.235 --> 17:09.530
Well, I got no money left
to pay off my civil suit debt,

17:09.613 --> 17:12.366
so I'm making a God's eye
to send to Fred Goldman.

17:13.867 --> 17:16.119
It's kind of nice, right?
Better than nothing.

17:16.203 --> 17:18.372
He's got money to buy
tongue depressors and yarn,

17:18.455 --> 17:19.915
but not enough to pay us back?

17:19.998 --> 17:22.042
You know how much mustache cream
that could've bought?

17:22.125 --> 17:25.170
I don't like the mustache, Fred.
Nobody likes the mustache.

17:25.254 --> 17:27.923
-That's why we lost the trial!
-That's not true!

17:35.764 --> 17:38.016
-Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.
-And I'm Diane Simmons.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.977
Our top story tonight,
Quahog, Rhode Island,

17:40.060 --> 17:42.646
known for quaint neighborhoods,
white sandy beaches

17:42.729 --> 17:46.024
and harboring blood-thirsty murderers?

17:46.108 --> 17:47.651
That's right, Tom.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.945
Former murderer O.J. Simpson
has moved to Quahog.

17:50.028 --> 17:51.697
We don't have footage
of the murder itself,

17:51.780 --> 17:53.448
but we can show you what happened,

17:53.532 --> 17:56.201
thanks to this reenactment
by the Quahog Opera Company.

I love you, Nicole

18:02.207 --> 18:05.294
But I must confess

18:05.836 --> 18:08.338
To some trepidation

18:08.422 --> 18:11.800
For I am a lowly waiter

18:46.627 --> 18:51.173
A thing!

18:53.926 --> 18:57.721
Well, it looks like this is one more town
the media has run me out of.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.348
Now, wait a second, Juice.

18:59.431 --> 19:01.225
You can't let them tell
you how to live your life.

19:01.350 --> 19:03.060
You've been running for too long.

19:03.143 --> 19:05.896
I say you let people get
to know you the way I have.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.606
You really think that's possible, Peter?

19:07.689 --> 19:08.941
Of course it is.

19:09.024 --> 19:11.276
We'll even throw a big party
and invite everybody in town.

19:11.360 --> 19:13.278
And I promise they'll accept you.

19:16.698 --> 19:20.369
Peter, I really appreciate this,
but are you sure people are ready?

19:20.494 --> 19:21.787
Absolutely, O.J.

19:21.870 --> 19:24.039
This party will give you a chance
to get to know everybody

19:24.122 --> 19:26.625
and give them a chance to get
to know the real O.J. Simpson.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.336
Peter, do you really expect
anyone to show up?

19:29.419 --> 19:32.172
Sure I do.
Look, here comes a bunch of people.

Uh, Peter, that's not a group
of enthusiastic party guests,

19:41.431 --> 19:42.599
that's an angry mob.

We don't love you like we did in 1993.

-D'oh!
-And as for you, O.J.,

19:52.651 --> 19:54.319
we don't want you here, either!

has to get by me!

No, Peter. This is my fight.
And I'll be the one to fight it.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.918
Look at you all.
Look what you're doing.

20:10.419 --> 20:12.963
Why, you're no better than
what you made me out to be.

20:13.213 --> 20:15.549
Sure, I've made some mistakes in my life.

20:15.632 --> 20:17.718
I forget to take the trash out some days.

20:18.051 --> 20:20.721
I've left the toothpaste cap
on the bathroom counter.

20:20.804 --> 20:22.347
I've taped football games without

20:22.431 --> 20:25.434
the expressed written consent
of the National Football League.

20:25.893 --> 20:29.521
I... I guess what I'm saying is,
I'm not perfect.

20:29.605 --> 20:32.316
The only difference is,
I have the courage to admit it.

20:32.858 --> 20:34.610
Does anyone else have the courage?

20:35.068 --> 20:38.030
If so, why don't you just
come on up here and join me.

20:38.197 --> 20:40.574
He's right. I'm not perfect.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.162
I suppose I'm not either.

20:47.748 --> 20:49.833
I guess none of us are perfect.

20:50.042 --> 20:51.877
Boy, do I feel like a jerk.

20:52.044 --> 20:53.295
Me, too.

20:53.837 --> 20:55.964
I think we owe you an apology, O.J.
