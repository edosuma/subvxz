00:01.906 --> 00:03.763
_

00:04.518 --> 00:06.451
My girl Oprah coming through with

00:06.453 --> 00:08.586
yet another dope rec.

00:08.588 --> 00:11.523
I know they say don't judge a
book by its cover, but

00:11.525 --> 00:13.825
this book jacket got me
feeling some kind of way.

00:13.827 --> 00:15.827
I got so flushed reading
the "about the author" that

00:15.829 --> 00:18.163
when Keith came home, I threw
the book in my naughty drawer.

00:18.165 --> 00:19.764
- Ooh.
- Get it, Michelle.

00:19.766 --> 00:21.132
What else you got in there?

00:21.134 --> 00:22.867
Well, my naughty drawer's
just really actually

00:22.869 --> 00:24.526
Keith's normal underwear drawer.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.204
Nothing gets my pizza oven fired up

00:26.206 --> 00:28.072
quite like my hubby's undies.

00:28.074 --> 00:31.843
Ooh, I respect that you
know what works for you.

00:31.845 --> 00:33.044
- Yeah.
- Yes.

00:33.046 --> 00:34.278
Jack, you're always reading in here.

00:34.303 --> 00:35.513
Want to join our book club?

00:35.515 --> 00:36.948
Oh, you should.

00:36.950 --> 00:39.184
We're reading "The Question Is the Answer"

00:39.186 --> 00:42.554
by this hot buttered
crumpet named Miles Leonard.

00:42.556 --> 00:43.688
Ooh.

00:43.690 --> 00:45.089
I think you would like it, Jack.

00:45.091 --> 00:46.724
It's philosophy, but
there's, like, a point to it.

00:46.726 --> 00:48.593
And how, pray tell, did you come by

00:48.595 --> 00:50.128
this fine piece of literature?

00:50.130 --> 00:51.796
It was Oprah's book club pick this month.

00:51.798 --> 00:53.665
She says the best place
to read it is, quote...

00:53.667 --> 00:56.000
"on a beach that you own."

00:56.002 --> 00:57.402
Okay.

00:57.404 --> 00:59.337
And you just follow along blindly, huh?

00:59.339 --> 01:00.359
Is that it?

01:00.360 --> 01:02.307
Well, listen to me, and listen well, okay?

01:02.309 --> 01:05.510
Philosophy is not a
popularity contest, okay?

01:05.512 --> 01:07.912
It is a precise and rigorous expression

01:07.914 --> 01:09.314
of universal truths.

01:09.316 --> 01:10.603
Yeah? It's not about

01:10.603 --> 01:12.350
who's "getting good buzz" and who's on TV

01:12.352 --> 01:14.519
on the stupid Oprah sho... You know what?

01:14.521 --> 01:15.987
You've ruined my empanada!

01:15.989 --> 01:18.020
Damn, could've just said no.

01:18.020 --> 01:19.664
Hey, Jack, guess what?

01:19.689 --> 01:21.059
Oh, you're in a bad mood. Cool beans.

01:21.110 --> 01:22.118
I'll tell you later.

01:22.118 --> 01:23.317
What are you gonna tell him later, Ralph?

01:23.319 --> 01:24.685
Is it a private medical thing?

01:24.687 --> 01:26.353
No, he does not let me

01:26.355 --> 01:27.521
share that stuff with him.

01:27.523 --> 01:29.256
But, ladies,

01:29.493 --> 01:33.373
I am a finalist for Innovative
Principal of the Year.

01:33.373 --> 01:34.740
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, I'm so proud!

01:34.743 --> 01:36.743
A little bit awesome.

01:36.745 --> 01:39.412
Just a little bit of good
news during a rough year,

01:39.414 --> 01:41.948
you know, with my
marriage collapsing and...

01:41.950 --> 01:43.583
- Uh, boo.
- No, please.

01:43.585 --> 01:45.351
Durbs, don't bum us out
while we're trying to dance.

01:45.353 --> 01:48.154
Okay, you guys, well,
while I have you on pause,

01:48.156 --> 01:50.356
this superintendent and her crew

01:50.358 --> 01:52.892
are coming tomorrow to
observe the school and me.

01:52.894 --> 01:55.161
So if each of you could put together

01:55.163 --> 01:57.096
an out-of-the-box
presentation,

01:57.098 --> 01:59.232
something big, something memorable,

01:59.234 --> 02:00.700
something tied into your subject...

02:00.702 --> 02:02.902
- Mm-hmm.
- Would really appreciate it.

02:02.904 --> 02:04.604
Oh, I know what I'ma do.

02:04.606 --> 02:06.739
- What is it?
- Girl, I'm not telling.

02:06.741 --> 02:08.541
You gotta get your own thing.

02:08.543 --> 02:09.876
Ooh, we got you, Durb.

02:09.877 --> 02:11.477
- We got you.
- Oh, I love it. I love it.

02:11.479 --> 02:13.946
And if I win, I'm gonna
take you all to Bennigan's.

02:13.948 --> 02:16.916
- Oh! You swear?
- Hit it out the park!

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:34.175 --> 02:36.343
_

02:36.530 --> 02:38.803
We definitely shouldn't open it. Right?

02:39.140 --> 02:40.701
But what if it's presents?

02:41.543 --> 02:43.147
I'm going for it.

03:01.153 --> 03:03.086
Fetal pigs!

03:04.200 --> 03:06.663
Oh, my God.

03:07.360 --> 03:08.959
This is so great.

03:08.962 --> 03:11.042
I've been waiting my whole
life to dissect a fetal pig.

03:11.116 --> 03:12.898
Mr. Griffin must be

03:12.900 --> 03:14.779
rewarding us for being good little angels.

03:14.779 --> 03:16.557
Everything's starting to go my way.

03:16.557 --> 03:17.823
Think these pigs went to Hell?

03:17.824 --> 03:19.223
Looks like there's only eight.

03:19.225 --> 03:20.358
Eight piggy presents.

03:20.360 --> 03:21.392
We're gonna have to pair up.

03:21.394 --> 03:22.651
- Oh.
- Oh, okay.

03:22.652 --> 03:24.590
- Hey, Dan.
- You want to team up?

03:24.788 --> 03:26.754
My dad owns a butcher shop, so

03:26.756 --> 03:29.023
I know my way around the inside of a pig.

03:29.729 --> 03:31.157
Uh, yeah, I'm down.

03:32.409 --> 03:33.540
Where does Oprah even got off

03:33.565 --> 03:34.954
endorsing Miles' book?

03:34.979 --> 03:37.525
It's insane. Unbelievable.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.083
It's got Stedman written all over it.

03:39.108 --> 03:40.107
That's who it was.

03:40.132 --> 03:41.198
Get out...

03:41.222 --> 03:42.558
_

03:42.559 --> 03:45.059
Oh, I set up a Google Alert
so we can stay on top of Miles.

03:45.294 --> 03:47.314
- Printed that out for you, boss.
- Oh.

03:47.815 --> 03:49.718
Well, thank you, Heather. Nice.

03:50.017 --> 03:52.918
What is that god-awful
smell? Is that meth?

03:52.920 --> 03:54.987
I swear, the wind blows
the wrong way in Ohio

03:54.989 --> 03:56.321
you get that meth whiff.

03:56.323 --> 03:57.607
The fetal pigs are here.

03:57.758 --> 03:59.224
We've already paired up and

03:59.226 --> 04:00.559
we'll dissect them really quietly.

04:00.561 --> 04:01.860
You wouldn't even have to do anything.

04:01.862 --> 04:03.095
Absolutely not.

04:03.097 --> 04:04.396
You guys are not doing a lab in my class.

04:04.398 --> 04:06.665
But we've been good little angels.

04:06.667 --> 04:08.295
No, you know what we've got here?

04:08.736 --> 04:09.835
A Miles mission.

04:11.405 --> 04:13.505
Please let us dissect them, Mr. Griffin.

04:13.507 --> 04:17.142
Yeah, boss, you know how much
I love sticking it to Miles,

04:17.144 --> 04:19.344
but this kind of means a lot.

04:19.346 --> 04:21.178
This is literally all I've got.

04:21.180 --> 04:22.915
I'm sorry. What I'm gonna do is

04:22.917 --> 04:25.038
take these little piglets, and
I'm gonna send them to Miles.

04:25.063 --> 04:27.374
Totally freak him out. It's
a truly perfect Miles mission.

04:27.374 --> 04:28.540
Mailing him pigs?

04:28.542 --> 04:30.576
Feels like it's missing a twist.

04:30.578 --> 04:32.778
Uh, Marcus, shut up.
It's... it's a solid plan.

04:32.780 --> 04:34.246
Yeah, I don't know, Mr. Griffin,

04:34.248 --> 04:35.781
I feel like maybe this needs a twist.

04:35.783 --> 04:36.822
A twist?

04:37.963 --> 04:40.264
Twist. Yeah, good point, Dan.

04:40.265 --> 04:42.324
- I said it, twist...
- This could use a twist.

04:43.068 --> 04:44.600
All right, let me go think about this.

04:44.602 --> 04:47.076
Twist, yeah. Have a good night, dudes.

04:59.138 --> 05:00.404
Go for Chops.

05:00.406 --> 05:01.872
<i>Chops, it's Jack.</i>

05:01.874 --> 05:03.267
<i>Our task rabbit's all set.</i>

05:03.442 --> 05:05.175
The box of pigs should arrive today,

05:05.177 --> 05:06.610
along with the T-shirt cannon,

05:06.612 --> 05:08.545
which really brings the whole plan to life.

05:08.547 --> 05:11.081
I need you to fire in the
direction of Miles Leonard,

05:11.083 --> 05:12.549
whose address I've included.

05:12.551 --> 05:13.884
Really terrify him.

05:13.886 --> 05:16.620
Can I just say this is, like, straight-up

05:16.622 --> 05:18.688
the sickest task I've ever had to rabbit.

05:18.690 --> 05:21.825
So, like, you're giving me
life right now, you feel me?

05:21.827 --> 05:23.455
Yeah, just get it done.

05:23.729 --> 05:25.529
Hey, Jack, Jack? A quick word?

05:25.531 --> 05:27.518
- Yeah.
- <i>...fire that.</i>

05:28.067 --> 05:29.599
And then we'll just, like, ghost on that.

05:29.601 --> 05:31.652
Hello? Hello?

05:31.652 --> 05:34.386
- Yeah, what's up, Ralph?
- Well, I... I'm not really sure.

05:34.388 --> 05:37.169
Overnight, I got this anonymous note

05:37.207 --> 05:39.472
saying that you had cancelled

05:39.919 --> 05:41.690
the fetal pig dissection.

05:42.333 --> 05:45.101
Who sent you this absurd accusation?

05:45.104 --> 05:46.970
Regardless of who sent it, is it true?

05:46.972 --> 05:48.372
Is it true? No.

05:48.374 --> 05:50.841
Why... why... why would I
cancel the dissection, man?

05:50.843 --> 05:53.110
I don't know, but it
would be really bad timing

05:53.112 --> 05:54.578
because the superintendent's coming.

05:54.580 --> 05:56.195
Really? Why?

05:56.415 --> 05:57.448
It's... I...

05:57.753 --> 06:00.087
Well, I'm up for Innovative
Principal of the Year.

06:00.642 --> 06:02.108
- You didn't know that?
- You are?

06:02.110 --> 06:05.011
Listen, I planned to end her tour

06:05.247 --> 06:08.482
with a live fetal pig dissection

06:08.484 --> 06:10.517
by a former Harvard professor.

06:10.519 --> 06:11.918
Wait, so she's coming to my class?

06:11.920 --> 06:13.620
Tomorrow? To observe?

06:13.622 --> 06:15.211
Yeah. Oh, I can't wait.

06:15.824 --> 06:17.958
I still can't for the life of me

06:17.960 --> 06:19.759
figure out what this note means.

06:19.761 --> 06:20.963
Well, I'll tell you what it means.

06:21.697 --> 06:24.060
You got pranked, my friend.

06:24.566 --> 06:26.133
But I'm gonna find out who the culprit is.

06:26.135 --> 06:27.230
Believe me, yeah.

06:27.503 --> 06:28.723
Look at me, Ralph.

06:30.139 --> 06:33.545
I'm gonna kill whoever pranked you.

06:34.276 --> 06:35.976
We're not supposed to kill the students.

06:35.978 --> 06:37.016
Shh.

06:37.913 --> 06:40.213
Hey, it's Jack. Call me back.

06:40.215 --> 06:41.781
I need you to return the dead pigs.

06:41.783 --> 06:44.885
I repeat, do not blast the dead baby pigs

06:44.887 --> 06:46.536
at my British nemesis.

06:46.755 --> 06:47.809
What?

06:50.025 --> 06:51.172
We have a rat.

07:04.915 --> 07:06.348
Oh, and you'll see what I mean, too.

07:06.373 --> 07:07.964
Uh-huh. Yes.

07:08.375 --> 07:10.652
Oh... oh, well, I am so sorry

07:10.677 --> 07:13.244
to hear about your catastrophe.

07:13.246 --> 07:16.681
Yes, Principal Durbin will
be there on Wednesday to help.

07:17.023 --> 07:20.429
Yes, and he... he will bring
clean water to your village.

07:20.429 --> 07:21.689
Uh-huh. For sure.

07:21.898 --> 07:23.731
All right, Thursday at the latest.

07:23.733 --> 07:24.832
Take care. Bye.

07:25.289 --> 07:27.366
Superintendent Bullard!

07:27.637 --> 07:29.436
You look smooth.

07:29.438 --> 07:31.535
Ellen. Always a pleasure.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.762
We're so dal-gone excited
for you to be here and...

07:35.478 --> 07:36.877
I gotta say...

07:36.879 --> 07:38.812
You find me a better guy

07:38.814 --> 07:40.881
than Principal Durbin and I will find you

07:40.883 --> 07:44.407
a guy who is on, like,
Seal Team Six or something,

07:44.831 --> 07:47.881
because that is the guy!

07:48.583 --> 07:51.442
Hey, oh, they took your doo-hickies off.

07:51.551 --> 07:52.828
My leg braces?

07:52.828 --> 07:55.262
Yeah, uh, I'm fully ambulatory now.

07:55.264 --> 07:57.397
- Oh, congrats.
- Good Christ, Helen.

07:57.794 --> 07:59.499
Superintendent Bullard,

07:59.501 --> 08:02.135
I... I am so excited to show you around.

08:02.137 --> 08:03.470
We're excited to see

08:03.472 --> 08:05.056
the innovative school you've created.

08:05.081 --> 08:08.284
Oh, well, our teachers
think outside the box,

08:08.309 --> 08:10.316
so brace yourself.

08:10.813 --> 08:11.940
Mm.

08:12.630 --> 08:14.030
Sorry.

08:14.783 --> 08:16.796
Oh, you think you got me, huh?

08:18.020 --> 08:19.152
One of you rats me out,

08:19.154 --> 08:20.454
you're all sitting there thinking,

08:20.456 --> 08:22.187
"I got him. I won."

08:23.492 --> 08:24.727
Well, know this.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.761
I won't be made to look like a fool

08:27.763 --> 08:29.052
in front of anyone.

08:29.398 --> 08:30.848
Certainly not some

08:31.100 --> 08:34.101
Midwest superintendent with a degree from a

08:34.102 --> 08:36.340
religious liberal arts college.

08:39.808 --> 08:42.256
Now, one of you is gonna
come forward and confess,

08:43.119 --> 08:45.243
or you're all missing your next class.

08:51.687 --> 08:53.197
Now, one of you sinned.

08:53.556 --> 08:55.722
Ya sinned real bad.

08:59.294 --> 09:00.814
Anything you want to admit, Vic?

09:00.839 --> 09:02.963
I got a boner when we learned CPR.

09:02.965 --> 09:05.294
Oh. Gross.

09:05.860 --> 09:07.259
How'd your partner feel about that?

09:07.261 --> 09:09.556
- Well, I think she, like...
- Never mind, I...

09:09.556 --> 09:10.755
Don't tell me. I don't want to know.

09:12.014 --> 09:13.586
I've got all the time in the world, guys.

09:17.453 --> 09:19.524
Looks like I'm gonna
have to turn up the heat.

09:24.326 --> 09:26.326
This is Stef Duncan,

09:26.328 --> 09:28.728
a phenomenal history teacher

09:28.730 --> 09:31.565
who endeavors to prove
that if we're not careful,

09:31.762 --> 09:34.601
the past can become the future.

09:34.603 --> 09:36.269
Thank you, Principal Durbin.

09:36.271 --> 09:38.134
All right, now the year

09:38.134 --> 09:40.374
is A.D. 79.

09:40.655 --> 09:42.008
I now present...

09:42.010 --> 09:43.710
Mount Vesuvius.

09:43.712 --> 09:45.579
Oh, Vesuvius.

09:45.581 --> 09:47.414
I'm sure everything's gonna be okay.

09:47.416 --> 09:48.687
Or will it?

09:54.356 --> 09:57.224
Oh, no. What is this, lava?

09:57.226 --> 09:59.192
"Ow, mama, my toga's burning."

09:59.194 --> 10:00.994
"Oh, my God, I'm dying."

10:00.996 --> 10:02.195
"Too much lava."

10:02.197 --> 10:03.892
What about the horses?

10:04.099 --> 10:06.183
"Oh, no, my sandals."

10:09.805 --> 10:11.734
I'll ask you nicely

10:13.373 --> 10:15.174
one more time.

10:16.678 --> 10:18.298
Are you the rat?

10:18.413 --> 10:20.821
Oh, God, please, stop.

10:24.504 --> 10:27.554
Admit it was you or
your bio textbook gets it.

10:28.690 --> 10:30.924
Huh? Fine.

10:30.926 --> 10:32.759
Guess we'll never know the definition of...

10:32.761 --> 10:34.738
"heterozygous advantage."

10:34.763 --> 10:35.729
Redacted.

10:35.731 --> 10:36.815
I don't know anything!

10:36.840 --> 10:38.231
You know everything!

10:47.442 --> 10:50.944
That was the most devastating
moment of my entire life.

10:50.946 --> 10:52.112
For real?

10:52.114 --> 10:54.197
Girl, you need to read Anne Frank.

10:58.585 --> 11:00.287
When you think of art,

11:00.289 --> 11:02.656
think of the three important M's:

11:02.658 --> 11:06.025
Manet, Monet, and Mar-ray.

11:06.428 --> 11:07.766
And who's Mar-ray?

11:07.791 --> 11:09.796
Why, it's art teacher extraordinaire

11:09.798 --> 11:10.997
Mary Wagner.

11:11.412 --> 11:12.884
Art is a feast

11:13.035 --> 11:15.535
that you cook in your mind oven

11:15.857 --> 11:19.048
and serve on your heart plate.

11:20.409 --> 11:21.563
I like art.

11:21.743 --> 11:23.276
Take it away, Mary.

11:23.278 --> 11:25.009
Thank you, Principal Durbin.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.480
Art is beautiful.

11:27.482 --> 11:28.949
Art is intense.

11:28.951 --> 11:31.401
It's provocative. It's subversive.

11:31.587 --> 11:33.754
And sometimes it can be...

11:35.886 --> 11:37.513
explosive.

11:38.269 --> 11:39.969
Another volcano, huh?

11:40.350 --> 11:41.771
Okay.

11:46.444 --> 11:47.910
I added sparkles.

11:47.912 --> 11:49.712
Ya welcome.

12:02.327 --> 12:03.477
Louder.

12:04.629 --> 12:05.828
Jazzier.

12:07.298 --> 12:09.065
You can stop this at any moment.

12:09.067 --> 12:11.992
You know, people say they
like jazz, but they don't.

12:12.737 --> 12:13.936
They don't.

12:13.938 --> 12:15.660
Less discernible melody!

12:16.741 --> 12:18.874
Yeah. You guys like that?

12:18.876 --> 12:20.903
Can't pick out any of the notes.

12:21.333 --> 12:23.204
That's great, man. That sucks.

12:25.185 --> 12:27.319
Unlike other schools, where they

12:27.321 --> 12:29.642
dress up like broccoli and rap about diet,

12:29.689 --> 12:33.071
we here at Whitlock treat
health like a real class.

12:33.170 --> 12:35.036
Take it away, Mrs. Jones.

12:35.038 --> 12:36.516
Don't tell me what to do.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.556
You're not my dad!

12:38.942 --> 12:40.508
I have a crush on the track captain

12:40.510 --> 12:42.210
and I'm addicted to e-cigarettes!

12:44.948 --> 12:46.915
That's what it's like to be a teenager.

12:46.917 --> 12:49.050
So many emotions bottled up,

12:49.052 --> 12:51.820
and you have to express
them all in a healthy way,

12:51.822 --> 12:53.822
- even the negative ones.
- _

12:53.824 --> 12:56.024
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Jones.

12:56.026 --> 12:57.659
Or what can happen is...

12:58.330 --> 13:00.244
_

13:00.269 --> 13:01.296
Oh, my God.

13:01.298 --> 13:02.990
A volcano!

13:04.901 --> 13:06.401
Ooh.

13:06.403 --> 13:09.304
Whoa!

13:24.054 --> 13:25.487
Unless the rat comes forward,

13:25.489 --> 13:27.122
I will pick a phone at random

13:27.124 --> 13:29.430
and start reading your
search history out loud.

13:29.493 --> 13:30.892
Just to get ahead of it,

13:30.894 --> 13:33.962
"ISIS" is also the name of a
junior women's bowling league.

13:36.541 --> 13:37.974
Hey, that's mine, dude.

13:37.999 --> 13:39.200
And I'm not giving you my passcode.

13:39.202 --> 13:40.902
Oh, really?

13:41.273 --> 13:42.604
That's too bad.

13:42.606 --> 13:43.772
Yo, what the hell?

13:43.774 --> 13:45.807
Who is the rat?

13:50.600 --> 13:52.600
- Yello?
- Jack attack.

13:52.602 --> 13:55.021
Got your message. Bad
news though, <i>papi.</i>

13:55.021 --> 13:56.788
The pigs are already gone.

13:56.790 --> 13:58.289
Wait, you used them on Miles?

13:58.543 --> 14:00.410
- Was he freaked?
- Uh, no dude.

14:00.412 --> 14:03.079
So it turns out the cannon
is kind of specifically

14:03.081 --> 14:05.548
calibrated for one type of ammunition.

14:05.550 --> 14:07.564
And that ammunition is T-shirts

14:07.565 --> 14:09.828
and is not pigs.

14:10.068 --> 14:11.767
So I tried to fire pigs out of it.

14:11.769 --> 14:14.937
They kind of just 'sploded
on the inside of it.

14:14.939 --> 14:17.239
Okay, so you're telling
me that the mission failed

14:17.714 --> 14:19.041
and the pigs are destroyed?

14:19.043 --> 14:20.409
<i>I mean, I don't like to think of it...</i>

14:20.411 --> 14:21.911
Did you say the pigs are destroyed?

14:21.913 --> 14:23.279
We can't do the lab?

14:23.579 --> 14:24.780
Heather, relax.

14:25.078 --> 14:26.211
It was me.

14:26.214 --> 14:28.781
- I'm the rat!
- It was you?

14:28.783 --> 14:31.571
Why didn't you say that an hour
ago before he threw my phone?

14:41.763 --> 14:43.429
- I mean... Dave, this does nothing for me.
- _

14:43.431 --> 14:44.730
Do you understand that?

14:44.732 --> 14:46.365
You went with your first thought.

14:46.367 --> 14:48.134
But I'm the geology teacher.

14:48.136 --> 14:50.803
I'm the only one it makes sense for.

14:50.805 --> 14:53.306
You boned me, Dave. Go take a lap.

14:53.308 --> 14:55.099
Yeah. Go.

14:55.343 --> 14:56.509
Eh.

14:56.511 --> 14:58.067
Don't "eh" me.

14:58.813 --> 14:59.766
Kfft.

14:59.791 --> 15:01.372
And don't "kfft" either.

15:03.484 --> 15:04.417
Ralph.

15:04.419 --> 15:05.618
We just wanted to say

15:05.620 --> 15:07.720
we're really sorry we let you down.

15:07.722 --> 15:09.589
Why did you all do the same thing?

15:09.591 --> 15:11.223
Well, we didn't plan to, but we all

15:11.225 --> 15:12.425
learned how to make volcanoes at the same

15:12.427 --> 15:14.093
teachers' conference last summer.

15:14.095 --> 15:15.953
Ohio Teach-tastic!

15:16.004 --> 15:18.330
Yes, and it all was a
hit for the teachers there,

15:18.333 --> 15:20.533
so we figured that it would help you win.

15:20.535 --> 15:22.335
I understand, okay? But I really need

15:22.337 --> 15:24.136
Jack to nail this dissection tomorrow.

15:24.138 --> 15:26.639
I mean, he and Coach and
basically my last hope.

15:26.641 --> 15:29.485
Make way for the volleyball-cano!

15:29.677 --> 15:30.705
Ralph.

15:34.643 --> 15:36.627
I can't believe Heather was the rat.

15:38.492 --> 15:40.526
Stay here, guys. I'ma go take care of this.

15:42.724 --> 15:44.090
If Mr. Griffin can't get the pigs back,

15:44.092 --> 15:45.558
how are we gonna perform the dissection

15:45.560 --> 15:47.193
in front of the superintendent tomorrow?

15:47.461 --> 15:48.493
We won't.

15:49.642 --> 15:50.974
He'll make a fool out of himself.

15:51.065 --> 15:53.208
And then we'll get a new teacher by Monday.

15:53.801 --> 15:55.128
Heather's a genius.

16:02.356 --> 16:03.943
What in the hell are you doing?

16:04.183 --> 16:05.882
You know, I'm the one who should be mad.

16:05.884 --> 16:07.117
You betrayed me.

16:07.119 --> 16:08.651
You ruined everything!

16:08.652 --> 16:09.886
The hell are you talking about?

16:09.888 --> 16:11.079
You wrote the note.

16:11.123 --> 16:12.255
And by the way, this is Michelle's car.

16:12.257 --> 16:13.613
Mine's across the lot.

16:13.613 --> 16:15.045
God, you don't get it!

16:15.302 --> 16:17.314
You ruined my shot with Dan.

16:17.316 --> 16:19.179
Wait... Dan Decker?

16:19.264 --> 16:21.197
Before you cancelled the lab,
me and Dan were partnered up.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.633
We were gonna spend the whole week

16:22.635 --> 16:24.401
carving up pigs and falling for each other.

16:24.403 --> 16:26.710
Hold on a second. So you betrayed me

16:26.735 --> 16:28.635
for some stupid high school crush?

16:28.660 --> 16:30.527
This was my chance to show him something

16:30.529 --> 16:32.164
that I'm really good at.

16:32.431 --> 16:33.963
And now you screwed it all up.

16:33.965 --> 16:35.532
Yeah, well now we're both screwed,

16:35.534 --> 16:37.033
'cause I gotta go find
something else to dissect

16:37.035 --> 16:39.027
or, thanks to you, I'm gonna
look like a fool tomorrow.

16:40.405 --> 16:43.008
You know, I might have
hurt you on accident,

16:43.575 --> 16:45.008
but you hurt me on purpose.

16:56.313 --> 16:58.680
All right, everyone shut up.

16:58.682 --> 17:00.482
Uh, apologies in advance

17:00.484 --> 17:02.984
for the brutal condition of this squirrel.

17:03.259 --> 17:04.400
Didn't really have...

17:06.169 --> 17:07.945
All right, what's the story here?

17:09.259 --> 17:11.904
This thing's beautiful. Organs all intact.

17:11.904 --> 17:13.318
Professionally butchered.

17:14.807 --> 17:15.883
Ah.

17:16.040 --> 17:18.550
I stole it from my dad's shop, boss.

17:20.146 --> 17:21.444
Knock knock, Jack.

17:21.513 --> 17:22.813
Here to bring the superintendent's tour

17:22.882 --> 17:24.115
to a close.

17:24.183 --> 17:26.117
We've all got high hopes for this one.

17:26.185 --> 17:27.585
Of course. Welcome, everyone.

17:27.654 --> 17:30.187
Oh, please tell me
this isn't a pig volcano.

17:30.256 --> 17:32.456
- A what?
- Pig volcano.

17:32.962 --> 17:35.204
I'm so sorry. I'm hearing "pig volcano."

17:35.283 --> 17:38.551
I was told this would
be a fetal pig dissection.

17:38.576 --> 17:39.778
This is a full-grown hog.

17:39.821 --> 17:41.989
Uh, yes. Well, um,

17:42.324 --> 17:44.647
piglets' organs are much too small

17:44.672 --> 17:47.339
to be properly observed
by the untrained eye.

17:47.408 --> 17:49.842
But Principal Durbin
gives us a lot of freedom,

17:49.911 --> 17:51.710
which Aristotle defines as

17:51.779 --> 17:55.014
"obedience to self-formulated rules."

17:55.082 --> 17:56.082
Now, that...

17:56.629 --> 17:57.850
That's innovation.

17:57.919 --> 17:59.351
Very innovative, yeah.

17:59.420 --> 18:00.737
So, shall we begin?

18:01.590 --> 18:02.688
All right.

18:02.757 --> 18:05.424
Welcome to A.P. Bio.
Let's begin the dissection.

18:05.493 --> 18:07.743
Heather, if you'd care to
assist the demonstration?

18:09.196 --> 18:11.349
- Sure thing, Mr. Griffin.
- Mm-hmm.

18:12.199 --> 18:13.866
All right. Now, keep in mind

18:13.935 --> 18:16.268
this can be an emotionally
difficult process,

18:16.337 --> 18:18.037
especially if you are working with a pig

18:18.105 --> 18:19.305
that you yourself raised.

18:19.796 --> 18:20.940
First thing you're gonna do

18:21.008 --> 18:22.041
is hack off the snout.

18:22.109 --> 18:23.208
It goes directly in the trash.

18:23.277 --> 18:24.543
The customers do not want that,

18:24.612 --> 18:25.711
unless they're French.

18:28.849 --> 18:31.107
I'm sorry. Uh, did you say "customers"?

18:31.188 --> 18:32.184
Yeppers.

18:32.184 --> 18:33.886
Next we're gonna hack off the hooves.

18:33.955 --> 18:35.455
Those also go directly in the trash.

18:43.464 --> 18:44.570
Mr. Griffin.

18:44.571 --> 18:46.170
Maybe you could explain the dissection

18:46.239 --> 18:48.955
using more standard scientific

18:49.188 --> 18:50.698
biological terms?

18:53.642 --> 18:55.513
You're right, Sarika. Of course.

18:55.582 --> 18:56.692
Thank you.

18:57.517 --> 18:58.646
Uh.

18:59.734 --> 19:02.662
Behold... the adrenal glands.

19:03.289 --> 19:05.123
The part of the endocrine
system responsible

19:05.191 --> 19:06.958
for producing various hormones:

19:07.026 --> 19:09.026
uh, cortisol, adrenaline, et cetera.

19:09.450 --> 19:12.597
Now here we find them on the
cephalic end of the kidneys

19:12.665 --> 19:14.799
instead of on top, which is what

19:14.868 --> 19:16.442
we would observe in humans.

19:17.437 --> 19:19.578
I never said I didn't know biology.

19:20.129 --> 19:22.047
I'm just never gonna teach it to you.

19:23.977 --> 19:25.910
Now, we use pigs because

19:25.979 --> 19:28.713
they have the same thoracic
and abdominal organs...

19:34.076 --> 19:35.156
There we go.

19:35.655 --> 19:38.917
I, uh, strongly recommend
a Memphis rub on those cuts.

19:38.988 --> 19:41.926
Mr. Griffin, this was very informative

19:41.995 --> 19:43.995
and certainly innovative.

19:44.063 --> 19:45.096
Ah.

19:45.165 --> 19:46.931
Whitlock is lucky to have you.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.806
Ah, thank you very much.

19:51.316 --> 19:53.938
Thank you Jack for bringing it home.

19:54.007 --> 19:54.972
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, my God.

19:55.041 --> 19:56.307
No sweat, Ralph.

19:56.376 --> 19:57.775
Thanks to you, I am in serious running

19:57.844 --> 20:00.085
for the Innovative Principal of the Year!

20:01.715 --> 20:03.581
Could I, uh, get a loin?

20:10.262 --> 20:11.559
- Hey, yo, H
-Bomb,

20:11.584 --> 20:12.731
check this crap out.

20:12.868 --> 20:15.895
- Hey, yo, Dan Decker, hold up.
- What's up?

20:15.895 --> 20:18.074
Um, Heather could probably
use a little bit of help

20:18.099 --> 20:19.997
cleaning this whole mess up. Cool, bud?

20:20.176 --> 20:21.409
Let me guess, if I don't...

20:21.477 --> 20:22.877
- I get an F?
- You get an F, yeah.

20:23.124 --> 20:24.562
Let's go. All right.

20:33.838 --> 20:36.257
Yo, that was pretty dope
the way you sliced that pig up.

20:37.052 --> 20:39.226
Yeah, yeah. Guess I'm kind of a boss.

20:50.406 --> 20:52.239
- I really suck at this.
- Yeah.
