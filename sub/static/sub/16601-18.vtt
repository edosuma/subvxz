WEBVTT

00:09.693 --> 00:11.994
All right,
all right.

00:11.996 --> 00:13.161
Listen up, everyone.

00:13.163 --> 00:15.864
I know most of you
are wondering how the hell

00:15.866 --> 00:17.900
in the world Russ Vandenberg

00:17.902 --> 00:19.200
got promoted

00:19.202 --> 00:20.335
to Detective First Grade.

00:20.337 --> 00:21.937
I've been wondering

00:21.939 --> 00:23.571
the same thing myself. So,

00:23.573 --> 00:25.840
given the hook I have
down at One PP,

00:25.842 --> 00:28.275
Commissioner Reagan.

00:29.478 --> 00:30.978
Careful, I'm
taking names.

00:31.814 --> 00:34.448
The commissioner,
he gave me this.

00:36.753 --> 00:37.818
It's blank, Reagan.

00:38.755 --> 00:39.920
It's not blank,

00:39.922 --> 00:40.987
it's invisible ink.

00:40.989 --> 00:42.355
What it says
is that

00:42.357 --> 00:44.758
though the proud people
of Russ's Dutch heritage

00:44.760 --> 00:46.225
have been
around New York

00:46.227 --> 00:48.461
since day one,

00:48.463 --> 00:50.730
but they've
actually been

00:50.732 --> 00:54.233
underrepresented
amongst the ranks of the NYPD.

00:54.235 --> 00:56.135
Which could be
a problem if, say,

00:56.137 --> 00:57.202
you need someone to hold back

00:57.204 --> 00:59.404
a flood by sticking a finger
in a dike.

01:00.174 --> 01:01.139
So,

01:01.141 --> 01:02.007
the commissioner

01:02.009 --> 01:03.809
has personally
instituted

01:03.811 --> 01:05.477
an affirmative action
program

01:05.479 --> 01:06.812
and Russ

01:06.814 --> 01:08.447
- is our official poster boy.
- Yeah!

01:11.552 --> 01:13.818
To Detective First Grade
Russ Vandenberg.

01:13.820 --> 01:15.853
<i>- Proost!</i>
<i>- Proost!</i>

01:15.855 --> 01:18.056
Thanks, man.

01:18.058 --> 01:19.991
Congrats.

01:27.734 --> 01:28.866
Ellen?

01:30.203 --> 01:31.167
Why don't you come in?

01:31.169 --> 01:33.136
I'm gonna wait out here.

01:33.138 --> 01:35.271
For what?

01:35.273 --> 01:36.707
Russ.

01:36.709 --> 01:38.475
He won't return
my calls or texts.

01:38.477 --> 01:39.743
What's wrong?

01:39.745 --> 01:43.580
You know anything about AA?
The 12 Steps?

01:43.582 --> 01:44.781
I know enough.

01:44.783 --> 01:47.250
Steps eight and nine are:

01:47.252 --> 01:48.618
“identify who you hurt

01:48.620 --> 01:51.721
because of your drinking
and make amends.”

01:51.723 --> 01:55.057
Right. And that's what you want

01:55.059 --> 01:56.792
to do with Russ tonight?

01:56.794 --> 01:59.528
An innocent woman is in prison

01:59.530 --> 02:02.264
on account of a questionable
collar we made.

02:02.266 --> 02:04.399
He needs to help me
set it right.

02:04.401 --> 02:07.568
He's had a few to drink,
he's celebrating.

02:07.570 --> 02:10.071
You're never gonna get what
you want out of him tonight.

02:10.073 --> 02:12.841
We have to set this right.
Me and him.

02:12.843 --> 02:14.175
And you will.

02:14.177 --> 02:16.544
Maybe tomorrow. Okay?

02:16.546 --> 02:18.113
Not tonight.

02:20.117 --> 02:21.649
Now let me drive you home.

02:23.886 --> 02:25.919
Come on.

02:29.258 --> 02:30.691
So, you've given us, what,

02:30.693 --> 02:33.360
five places you don't want
your retirement party.

02:33.362 --> 02:36.229
Six, if you count go-kart racing
in Jersey City.

02:36.231 --> 02:37.564
Oh, Garrett just
threw that one in

02:37.566 --> 02:39.032
'cause he knows
you like to go there.

02:39.034 --> 02:40.466
I don't want a retirement party.

02:40.468 --> 02:42.802
You got to. Think of all
the guys you'd be letting down.

02:42.804 --> 02:44.637
It's just one of those things
you got to do.

02:44.639 --> 02:46.505
I don't want to retire.
It is what it is,

02:46.507 --> 02:48.675
you might as well go out with
a bang and an open bar, right?

02:48.677 --> 02:50.342
I'm afraid I'm not gonna be
as easy as that.

02:50.344 --> 02:51.744
- Oh.
- Travis.

02:51.746 --> 02:52.545
It's mandatory.

02:52.547 --> 02:53.980
The eve of your 63rd birthday.

02:53.982 --> 02:56.748
It's a civil rights violation,
if it came to that.

02:56.750 --> 02:58.717
Not that it's gonna
come to that.

02:58.719 --> 03:00.786
Well, then,
you're making an exception.

03:00.788 --> 03:02.054
Oh, come on,
how many

03:02.056 --> 03:03.055
exceptions have I given you?

03:03.057 --> 03:04.122
What do you mean?

03:04.124 --> 03:05.490
It means you're long
over your limit.

03:05.492 --> 03:07.392
Well, name one.
This, for one thing.

03:07.394 --> 03:08.459
I get razor bumps.

03:08.461 --> 03:10.662
But I never asked
for a doctor's note.

03:10.664 --> 03:13.430
Name one real exception.

03:15.267 --> 03:18.769
Travis, you do not want
to walk out the door

03:18.771 --> 03:20.370
kicking and screaming.

03:20.372 --> 03:22.372
What if it was you, Frank?

03:22.374 --> 03:24.474
What if they tossing you
to the curb, what,

03:24.476 --> 03:26.711
because of some date
on your birth certificate?

03:26.713 --> 03:30.180
Not an issue for me,
I'm not a cop anymore.

03:30.182 --> 03:32.115
Then it is an issue.

03:32.117 --> 03:33.282
You're a good top cop because

03:33.284 --> 03:36.619
you can still walk miles
in a cop's shoes.

03:40.391 --> 03:42.892
He knows we cut corners.
We talked about it,

03:42.894 --> 03:46.029
agreed not to bring up
the problem with the case

03:46.031 --> 03:48.430
unless anyone asked
and no one did.

03:48.432 --> 03:52.367
And this directly led to this
Cerise Paxton's conviction?

03:52.369 --> 03:53.736
Yes.

03:53.738 --> 03:56.739
She had a long record already.
Russ painted it as one of those

03:56.741 --> 03:59.674
“you know she's guilty
of something” things.

03:59.676 --> 04:02.277
He wanted that murder collar,
he was in a hurry up the ladder.

04:02.279 --> 04:03.511
And you?

04:03.513 --> 04:06.347
I was drinking
a quart of vodka a day

04:06.349 --> 04:07.782
and eating oxys
like peanuts.

04:07.784 --> 04:09.617
I needed him to cover me.

04:09.619 --> 04:11.986
There's not a cop in the world,
at least none that I know,

04:11.988 --> 04:13.821
who are gonna give up
their entire career

04:13.823 --> 04:15.156
over one questionable collar.

04:15.158 --> 04:16.357
You would.

04:16.358 --> 04:18.459
If the person went away
for a murder

04:18.461 --> 04:20.894
they didn't commit.

04:20.896 --> 04:22.662
Look, you want my advice?

04:22.664 --> 04:25.098
If you really want to press
this, you're gonna have to

04:25.100 --> 04:26.900
talk to Internal Affairs.
Maybe they'll listen.

04:26.902 --> 04:29.770
I don't want to jam Russ up.
I just want to make this right.

04:29.772 --> 04:33.140
I don't think you can get one
without the other.

04:33.142 --> 04:36.109
Okay, Danny.

04:36.111 --> 04:38.177
Thanks anyway.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.993
Hey, I called dibs on
the last jelly donut.

04:53.995 --> 04:55.559
Uh, you can't call dibs.

04:55.561 --> 04:57.162
- Can, too.
- Says who?

04:57.164 --> 04:58.163
Says her.

04:58.165 --> 04:59.864
And who died
and made her boss?

05:01.034 --> 05:02.167
Welch, come on.

05:02.169 --> 05:04.235
Finders keepers.
Don't be a dick.

05:04.237 --> 05:06.204
Guys, it's just a donut, let's
not make a beef of this, too.

05:06.206 --> 05:08.206
Rookies should be seen
and not heard.

05:14.847 --> 05:15.879
You okay?

05:15.881 --> 05:18.448
Mmm. Mmm.

05:18.450 --> 05:19.582
Welch, what up?

05:19.584 --> 05:21.985
Shave cream?
What?

05:21.987 --> 05:24.188
You put shave cream
in my donut?

05:24.190 --> 05:25.422
No, it must have just gone bad.

05:25.424 --> 05:26.924
Donuts don't go bad.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.260
This means war.

05:43.975 --> 05:45.607
Morning, Baez.

05:49.546 --> 05:50.678
Comfortable?

05:50.680 --> 05:52.780
Sergeant Bannon,
Internal Affairs.

05:52.782 --> 05:54.582
I, uh...

05:54.584 --> 05:56.684
I need a couple minutes.

05:58.121 --> 06:01.089
Well, the boss ain't in.
Why don't we go in his office?

06:09.665 --> 06:12.066
So where'd you take
Ellen Turner last night?

06:12.068 --> 06:14.534
Witnesses put her
in your car

06:14.536 --> 06:16.536
leaving the racket
for Detective Vandenberg.

06:16.538 --> 06:17.404
Witnesses?

06:17.406 --> 06:18.672
People saw you.

06:18.674 --> 06:19.840
You saying they didn't?

06:19.842 --> 06:21.241
What's this about?

06:21.243 --> 06:23.743
Her son says
she didn't come home last night.

06:23.745 --> 06:25.845
And then she left a message,
also last night, for IA,

06:25.847 --> 06:27.680
said to expect her
at 8:00 this morning,

06:27.682 --> 06:29.615
said it was urgent.
She never showed up.

06:31.152 --> 06:34.020
So, you tell me,
what's this all about?

06:34.022 --> 06:35.588
Don't know.
Gave her a ride home.

06:35.590 --> 06:36.856
I used to know her, we
talked about the job.

06:36.858 --> 06:38.323
That's it.
That's it?

06:38.325 --> 06:39.457
Yeah, that's it.

06:39.459 --> 06:42.094
I mean, did I watch
her walk in the door?

06:42.096 --> 06:43.262
No. I drove off.

06:43.264 --> 06:44.562
She say she was planning
to meet someone?

06:44.564 --> 06:45.563
Any plans at all?

06:45.565 --> 06:47.432
Not that she told me about.

06:47.434 --> 06:48.333
Uh-huh.

06:48.335 --> 06:50.602
What does that mean? “Uh-huh”?

06:50.604 --> 06:52.237
I'm just looking
for something helpful.

06:52.239 --> 06:54.372
Well, I swear to you,
I'm trying to be helpful.

06:54.374 --> 06:56.640
I don't know how much you know
about former Detective Turner,

06:56.642 --> 06:58.575
but she's lead
kind of a complicated life.

06:58.577 --> 06:59.911
Yeah, I gathered that.

06:59.913 --> 07:02.947
Okay. Has this turned into
a missing persons case?

07:02.949 --> 07:03.981
Not yet.

07:03.983 --> 07:05.116
I mean,
it wouldn't be the first time

07:05.118 --> 07:06.083
she didn't make it home.

07:06.085 --> 07:07.318
If you know what I'm saying.

07:07.320 --> 07:10.054
But I'll reach out
and see if I can find her.

07:11.823 --> 07:13.689
Let me know
if you find anything.

07:52.829 --> 07:54.096
Albany block your number?

07:54.098 --> 07:55.830
More or less.

07:55.832 --> 07:56.588
Dad...

07:56.612 --> 07:57.926
Run it by some
of your friendlies,

07:57.927 --> 07:59.108
see if you can get any traction.

07:59.109 --> 08:01.676
- I can tell you...
- Try first.

08:01.678 --> 08:03.144
Kind of like
a stay of execution.

08:03.146 --> 08:06.046
Mandatory retirement is
hardly the same as execution.

08:06.048 --> 08:08.115
It is to some guys.

08:08.117 --> 08:10.083
It is to Travis Jackson.

08:10.085 --> 08:11.785
It would be to me.

08:11.787 --> 08:13.820
Maybe you two need
some perspective.

08:13.822 --> 08:15.256
Or maybe Albany does.

08:15.258 --> 08:16.214
How so?

08:16.238 --> 08:17.592
Maybe the law's
out of date.

08:17.593 --> 08:20.938
I mean, 63 today is not the
same age as it was 50 years ago.

08:20.962 --> 08:21.695
Okay.

08:21.696 --> 08:25.431
For argument's sake, what should
be the mandatory retirement age?

08:26.069 --> 08:28.168
Whatever I say it is.

08:28.170 --> 08:30.436
Okay, now we're
getting somewhere.

08:30.491 --> 08:32.524
Well, higher than 63.

08:32.525 --> 08:34.760
See what you can do?

08:34.761 --> 08:36.193
I can already see
what I can do,

08:36.196 --> 08:37.996
- and it's not much, but I...
- Sorry.

08:37.998 --> 08:40.895
Hi, Erin. I didn't know you were
gracing the fourteenth floor.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.164
We're trying to find
a way to keep all cops

08:43.166 --> 08:45.266
under his thumb
past the age 63.

08:45.268 --> 08:46.634
Well, you got company.

08:46.636 --> 08:49.903
Frank, Travis Jackson's filing
an age-discrimination lawsuit

08:49.905 --> 08:52.773
against the NYPD.

08:57.212 --> 09:00.112
<i>I already said she didn't call.</i>

09:00.114 --> 09:01.314
- Text?
- No.

09:01.316 --> 09:02.615
When was the last time

09:02.617 --> 09:03.749
you talked to her?

09:03.751 --> 09:05.151
I don't know.
After school,

09:05.153 --> 09:06.686
- or maybe before.
- What are you

09:06.688 --> 09:09.389
trying to hide here, Richie?

09:09.391 --> 09:11.557
Come on. There's something
you're not telling us.

09:12.393 --> 09:14.859
Look, she came home.

09:14.861 --> 09:17.162
She went out again later,
but she came home.

09:17.164 --> 09:18.397
She did come home.

09:18.399 --> 09:19.798
Okay, what else?

09:19.800 --> 09:21.700
Russ came by.

09:21.702 --> 09:23.968
Detective Vandenberg came by?
Yeah.

09:23.970 --> 09:25.837
Why did you lie
to Internal Affairs about that?

09:25.839 --> 09:28.772
He and Mom had a fight.

09:28.774 --> 09:32.810
Something about some woman they
put away, Mom thinks wrongly.

09:32.812 --> 09:35.513
A <i>fight</i> fight,
like a physical fight?

09:35.515 --> 09:37.215
- He put his hands on your mom?
- No.

09:37.217 --> 09:39.383
Russ would never.
Just yelling.

09:39.385 --> 09:41.385
He took off. About ten minutes
later, Mom did, too.

09:41.387 --> 09:42.587
Why do you feel

09:42.589 --> 09:43.821
like you have to protect Russ?

09:43.823 --> 09:45.089
I'm not protecting him.
He didn't do anything.

09:45.091 --> 09:46.189
Whatever you're doing.

09:46.191 --> 09:47.357
He's never been anything

09:47.359 --> 09:48.958
but great to me,
and-and I thought maybe

09:48.960 --> 09:51.094
if I did him a solid,
he'd come around again more.

09:51.096 --> 09:53.096
He used to come around when
your mom was on the job?

09:53.098 --> 09:54.698
All the time.

09:57.001 --> 09:59.102
That better be Mom.

09:59.104 --> 10:02.371
It's Detective Vandenberg.

10:02.373 --> 10:04.973
Hey, Russ. You seen my mom?

10:05.809 --> 10:07.476
Russ.

10:07.478 --> 10:10.279
Hey, it's Danny Reagan.

10:10.281 --> 10:12.481
Listen, Ellen's been MIA
since last night.

10:12.483 --> 10:14.750
No, no, what's gonna happen next

10:14.752 --> 10:17.453
is you and me are gonna sit down
and talk privately.

10:17.455 --> 10:20.154
Where are you?

10:20.156 --> 10:22.757
All right. Yeah, I'll meet you
there in an hour.

10:22.759 --> 10:27.161
Coogan's, yeah, one hour.
All right.

10:35.938 --> 10:38.037
What kind of truce?

10:38.039 --> 10:39.706
Any kind. I don't like
walking around here,

10:39.708 --> 10:40.807
waiting for a lousy surprise.

10:40.809 --> 10:42.309
We get enough of that
out on the street.

10:42.311 --> 10:43.744
What'd you have in mind?

10:43.746 --> 10:46.212
We take them out for
drinks after our tour.

10:46.214 --> 10:47.247
We bury the hatchet.

10:47.249 --> 10:48.548
Matter of fact,
what is the hatchet?

10:48.550 --> 10:49.516
What do you mean?

10:49.518 --> 10:50.784
I mean, who started
it? Us or them?

10:50.786 --> 10:52.852
Him. He put sushi
in your locker.

10:52.854 --> 10:55.321
Right, okay, all right, well,
we got him back already.

10:55.323 --> 10:57.390
Not her.
I don't know if she's all in.

10:57.392 --> 10:58.391
She's just a rookie.

10:58.393 --> 11:00.526
Officers Reagan and Janko.
Yeah.

11:00.528 --> 11:02.595
Sarge?

11:02.597 --> 11:05.698
Sergeant Bond, Fleet Services.

11:06.668 --> 11:08.601
I want to thank you
for volunteering

11:08.603 --> 11:11.569
for the NYPD Green Vehicle
pilot program.

11:11.571 --> 11:14.172
Volunteering for...?

11:14.174 --> 11:16.641
A smaller carbon footprint
starts with a single step.

11:16.643 --> 11:18.176
Oh, sorry, I...

11:18.178 --> 11:19.411
we didn't...

11:19.413 --> 11:20.378
Didn't give it a second thought

11:20.380 --> 11:21.646
when we heard
about the opportunity.

11:21.648 --> 11:23.247
Vehicle's out
in the back lot.

11:23.249 --> 11:26.250
Let's go get acquainted.

11:34.159 --> 11:36.092
<i>'Cause if we called Welch out,</i>

11:36.094 --> 11:37.828
<i>we'd likely have IA</i>
<i>down on all of us.</i>

11:37.830 --> 11:39.262
<i>This sucks.</i>

11:39.264 --> 11:41.332
<i>All units, 10-53,</i>
<i>drivers in dispute.</i>

11:41.334 --> 11:43.266
<i>Intersection 20th and 12th.</i>

11:43.268 --> 11:45.468
<i>12 David,</i>
<i>show us responding.</i>

11:54.346 --> 11:55.511
Hey!

11:55.513 --> 11:57.747
Hey, back off
from each other!

11:57.749 --> 11:58.848
Back off!

11:58.850 --> 12:00.683
Back off of each other!

12:00.685 --> 12:02.517
Get out of my face.
Get out of my face.

12:02.519 --> 12:03.719
Drop the bat!

12:03.721 --> 12:05.420
Relax!

12:06.890 --> 12:08.156
Y'all can't be real cops.

12:08.158 --> 12:10.158
Yes, we are.
What, driving that thing?

12:10.160 --> 12:12.427
Hey!

12:12.429 --> 12:14.529
Our car!
Where's his medallion?!

12:14.531 --> 12:16.197
Come on!

12:16.199 --> 12:18.499
Get off the car!
Listen, he needs medallion.

12:18.501 --> 12:19.767
Get off the car!
Back up!

12:19.769 --> 12:20.835
Back up, back up!

12:20.837 --> 12:22.936
Sit down. Central, 12 David.

12:22.938 --> 12:25.473
Requesting a 10-85 forthwith
at this location...

12:29.846 --> 12:31.912
We argued, yeah.

12:31.914 --> 12:33.748
What she's asking me
to do is nuts.

12:33.750 --> 12:37.016
Okay, but is it nuts and
the right thing or just nuts?

12:37.018 --> 12:40.019
Risk losing my shield
for some career criminal

12:40.021 --> 12:41.120
doing another stint in prison?

12:41.122 --> 12:42.756
It's a manslaughter rap.

12:42.758 --> 12:44.056
I didn't convict her.

12:44.058 --> 12:47.159
I mean, I didn't sentence her,
neither did Ellen.

12:47.161 --> 12:49.462
You gathered the evidence, you
built the case, you testified.

12:49.464 --> 12:50.463
That's what we do.

12:50.465 --> 12:51.898
100% legit?

12:51.900 --> 12:53.365
- What, the collar?
- Yeah.

12:53.367 --> 12:54.900
I'll stand behind it
all day long.

12:54.902 --> 12:56.435
Well, Ellen's not
standing behind it.

12:56.437 --> 12:57.936
She thinks it's slanted.

12:57.938 --> 12:59.938
Ellen was pretty slanted herself
most of the time.

12:59.940 --> 13:01.273
She got sober.

13:01.275 --> 13:02.974
And I'm happy for her,
but it doesn't mean

13:02.976 --> 13:04.342
she gets to go
through our cases,

13:04.344 --> 13:06.311
looking for good deeds
she can do.

13:07.681 --> 13:09.680
What's her beef?

13:09.682 --> 13:12.116
Come on. Danny.

13:12.118 --> 13:13.818
Do you want me on your side?

13:13.820 --> 13:15.019
What's her beef?

13:19.626 --> 13:24.028
Cerise Paxton had a mole.

13:24.030 --> 13:25.396
Here.

13:25.398 --> 13:26.830
Okay.

13:26.832 --> 13:29.766
When I showed the eyewitness
a photo array,

13:29.768 --> 13:33.503
I forgot to ink little moles
on the other five filler photos.

13:33.505 --> 13:35.472
So, yeah,
you want to stretch

13:35.474 --> 13:38.341
a perp's rights
all the way to Alaska?

13:38.343 --> 13:42.078
It could be considered
a slightly slanted ID.

13:42.080 --> 13:44.146
- And that's it?
- That's it.

13:44.148 --> 13:45.915
And not for nothing.

13:46.918 --> 13:48.317
Cerise Paxton has a record

13:48.319 --> 13:50.853
going back to age 12.

13:50.855 --> 13:52.455
There's not a day in her life

13:52.457 --> 13:56.625
where she did not break
some law somewhere.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.260
Yeah, so if she's
not guilty of that,

13:58.262 --> 13:59.294
she's guilty of something else.

13:59.296 --> 14:01.162
Tell me you never
say that to yourself.

14:05.368 --> 14:07.569
Reagan.

14:07.571 --> 14:11.539
Are you kidding me?

14:11.541 --> 14:13.942
All right.

14:13.944 --> 14:17.378
I'll, uh, I'll meet you there
in a half an hour.

14:19.582 --> 14:23.450
Harbor just fished Ellen's body
out of the East River.

14:33.729 --> 14:36.395
Hey. Hey!

14:38.733 --> 14:40.399
You're coming with me.

14:54.680 --> 14:56.944
You went around me
and you jumped the gun.

14:56.945 --> 14:58.945
Jumped the gun?
The date's a week from now.

14:58.947 --> 15:01.281
You knew the retirement age
when you came on the job.

15:01.283 --> 15:03.049
I also knew I was gonna die
when I was little.

15:03.051 --> 15:04.351
It doesn't mean
I planned my own funeral.

15:04.353 --> 15:05.518
Oh, come on, Travis.

15:05.520 --> 15:08.820
I have earned my right
as a citizen, as a man,

15:08.822 --> 15:11.023
as a cop who hasn't lost
a single step.

15:11.025 --> 15:12.358
Look, I made an appeal
to Albany.

15:12.360 --> 15:13.625
Don't hold your breath
and you know it.

15:13.627 --> 15:14.593
Just give it a chance.

15:14.595 --> 15:16.328
My family has been
in this country

15:16.330 --> 15:17.529
since the 1840s.

15:17.531 --> 15:20.932
I was ten before they passed
the Civil Rights Act.

15:20.934 --> 15:22.534
Any breaks I caught in life,

15:22.536 --> 15:24.569
I caught while
I was swimming upstream.

15:26.272 --> 15:28.706
And now I'm 62.

15:28.708 --> 15:31.376
I'm not about to start to just
going with the flow, understand?

15:31.378 --> 15:33.644
No, I don't understand.

15:33.646 --> 15:36.547
You're a smart man
on a fool's errand.

15:38.318 --> 15:41.719
It's... It's nothing
against you, boss.

15:41.721 --> 15:43.353
I believe you're gonna do
everything you can,

15:43.355 --> 15:45.489
but rocking the boat
is not your style.

15:49.061 --> 15:53.630
I am a good cop--
no, more than good,

15:53.632 --> 15:56.466
and more valuable

15:56.468 --> 15:59.701
for all the years I've been one.

15:59.703 --> 16:01.670
I have earned
this right to fight.

16:01.672 --> 16:03.672
You have also
earned the gratitude

16:03.674 --> 16:06.475
and respect of this department.

16:06.477 --> 16:07.976
Are you gonna throw
all that away

16:07.978 --> 16:10.812
with a lawsuit
against this department?

16:10.814 --> 16:13.215
Well, if I've earned it...

16:13.217 --> 16:15.251
I guess it's up to me
how I spend it.

16:15.253 --> 16:16.384
You don't want to listen.

16:16.386 --> 16:17.485
I did listen,

16:17.487 --> 16:20.855
but listening
isn't always agreeing.

16:25.795 --> 16:27.662
If that's all, Commissioner.

16:28.998 --> 16:31.166
Yeah. Dismissed.

16:48.284 --> 16:51.684
There's no wounds

16:51.686 --> 16:54.187
or evidence of trauma that
would indicate a struggle

16:54.189 --> 16:55.888
or a jump from a bridge.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.390
Okay, so what?

16:57.392 --> 17:00.126
There was an empty eight ounce
flask found in her coat.

17:00.128 --> 17:01.494
She stopped drinking.

17:01.496 --> 17:04.329
Maybe she started again,
used the liquid courage

17:04.332 --> 17:06.499
to take the plunge
and swim to the other side.

17:06.501 --> 17:07.665
You know that?

17:07.666 --> 17:09.601
Not until the tox panel
comes back, no,

17:09.603 --> 17:10.902
just adding two and two.

17:10.904 --> 17:13.037
She was real committed to AA.

17:13.039 --> 17:14.806
Then I gladly stand corrected.

17:14.808 --> 17:17.976
At any rate, air and water
temperature what it was,

17:17.978 --> 17:21.213
she'd have slipped unconscious
in under three minutes.

17:21.214 --> 17:22.414
Painless?

17:22.415 --> 17:24.348
Pretty much.

17:27.153 --> 17:30.321
Give us a second, okay?

17:42.567 --> 17:44.334
You okay?

17:44.336 --> 17:46.236
Not really.

17:46.238 --> 17:49.905
Just, uh, thinking of her
going off like that.

17:49.907 --> 17:52.041
Listen, here's what
you're gonna do.

17:52.043 --> 17:54.244
You're gonna go
to Internal Affairs

17:54.246 --> 17:55.678
and tell them everything.

17:55.680 --> 17:56.979
About what?

17:56.981 --> 17:59.648
About what Ellen was up to,
about your argument,

17:59.650 --> 18:00.949
about everything.

18:00.951 --> 18:04.253
You think I had something
to do with this?

18:04.255 --> 18:06.388
It doesn't matter
what I think, all right?

18:06.390 --> 18:08.890
You were with her last night,
which they were lied to about.

18:08.892 --> 18:10.925
She wanted something from you
that you weren't gonna give

18:10.927 --> 18:12.427
which you fought about.

18:12.429 --> 18:14.696
That speaks to opportunity
and motive both.

18:14.698 --> 18:17.131
Screw you, Reagan.

18:20.102 --> 18:21.235
Russ.

18:21.237 --> 18:22.303
Go get out ahead of this.

18:22.305 --> 18:24.672
Look, if you're not
gonna go there

18:24.674 --> 18:27.741
and tell them the truth,
I'll do it myself.

18:44.326 --> 18:46.293
He really drinks
peppermint schnapps?

18:46.295 --> 18:47.827
Legend has it.

18:53.601 --> 18:54.800
What's this?

18:54.802 --> 18:56.202
It's a peace offering.

18:56.204 --> 18:57.469
Let's call it even.

18:57.471 --> 18:58.804
How'd it go today?

18:58.806 --> 19:00.906
Oh, about as humiliating
as you were hoping it'd be.

19:00.908 --> 19:02.575
What do you say?

19:02.577 --> 19:03.676
Truce?

19:03.678 --> 19:04.976
You mean it?

19:04.978 --> 19:06.611
Quit while we're all ahead.
What do you say?

19:06.613 --> 19:08.613
Done.

19:08.615 --> 19:09.914
Wait.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.353
Might be a rookie,
but I wasn't born yesterday.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.654
What?

19:16.656 --> 19:18.590
It's a Mickey.
You think?

19:18.592 --> 19:20.425
They're offering
you a truce out of thin air

19:20.427 --> 19:22.026
by bringing you a drink
with who knows what in it?

19:22.028 --> 19:23.793
It's peppermint schnapps.

19:23.795 --> 19:26.530
Wow. You almost had me.

19:26.532 --> 19:28.565
You really think we
would give a fellow cop

19:28.567 --> 19:30.166
a drink with a Mickey in it?

19:30.168 --> 19:32.001
Well, now that I
think about it...

19:32.003 --> 19:33.136
It might've been
a war to you,

19:33.138 --> 19:35.305
but it was just
a stupid feud to us.

19:35.307 --> 19:36.806
We would never do that, man.

19:36.808 --> 19:38.007
And you, shame on you.

19:40.045 --> 19:42.545
Truce cancelled.

19:49.186 --> 19:52.121
Screw both of you.

19:54.659 --> 19:56.525
<i>The governor at the time</i>

19:56.527 --> 19:59.561
vetoed pushing the
retirement age

19:59.563 --> 20:01.596
without hesitation,
and since then,

20:01.598 --> 20:03.565
no one has even
questioned it.

20:03.567 --> 20:06.334
Certainly not this governor.
The state puts all

20:06.336 --> 20:08.236
police departments
in the same basket.

20:08.238 --> 20:11.105
So while a later retirement age
may work for a big city,

20:11.107 --> 20:14.408
it may not for a small town with
a force of three to four cops,

20:14.410 --> 20:16.543
who are already entrenched,
and not in a good way.

20:16.545 --> 20:17.578
Any other way in?

20:17.580 --> 20:18.746
It's not happening.

20:18.748 --> 20:20.247
Certainly not
in the short term,

20:20.249 --> 20:22.949
and especially not
on the wholesale level.

20:22.951 --> 20:24.318
Retail?

20:24.320 --> 20:25.386
To what end?

20:25.388 --> 20:27.421
Just to please
Chief Jackson,

20:27.423 --> 20:29.290
but piss off the
thousands of guys

20:29.292 --> 20:31.091
that toed the line
and then retired

20:31.093 --> 20:33.192
without filing suits?
Then there's that.

20:33.194 --> 20:35.295
Don't rock the boat.

20:37.064 --> 20:39.031
What?

20:39.033 --> 20:40.933
Nothing.

20:40.935 --> 20:42.735
Is this about the chief or you?

20:42.737 --> 20:44.170
How could it be
about me?

20:44.172 --> 20:46.272
Your own retirement.
What about it?

20:46.274 --> 20:48.307
The fear of it.

20:48.309 --> 20:50.442
I don't fear it.
I am looking forward

20:50.444 --> 20:52.477
to hanging out
at the hardware store,

20:52.479 --> 20:54.513
pestering the owner
about the placement

20:54.515 --> 20:57.616
of the surveillance cameras.

20:57.618 --> 20:59.117
Nice dodge.

20:59.119 --> 21:01.085
Thank you.

21:07.493 --> 21:11.061
And you're sure you're not
just trying to protect Russ?

21:11.063 --> 21:12.830
Russ doesn't need
protecting from me.

21:12.832 --> 21:15.032
Not typically.
Not ever.

21:15.034 --> 21:17.201
There's nothing to say
about Russ except

21:17.203 --> 21:19.370
he had my mom's back,
and mine, too,

21:19.372 --> 21:22.105
and he's the last person
who would do her any harm.

21:22.107 --> 21:24.541
I hear you.

21:27.979 --> 21:29.212
Can I ask you a question?

21:29.214 --> 21:31.147
Of course you can.

21:33.518 --> 21:35.051
Was she drunk?

21:38.056 --> 21:41.156
The toxicology--
the test where they would

21:41.158 --> 21:42.491
be able to determine that,

21:42.493 --> 21:43.892
it hasn't come back yet.

21:43.894 --> 21:46.495
But you think what?

21:46.497 --> 21:47.696
It really doesn't
matter what I think.

21:47.698 --> 21:50.799
Come on. Please?

21:53.404 --> 21:55.704
They found an empty flask
on her.

21:55.706 --> 21:57.204
That's it?

21:57.206 --> 21:59.974
A flask that would be used
to hold liquor in it,

21:59.976 --> 22:02.276
and it was empty.

22:02.278 --> 22:04.798
That flask has been empty
for nine months.

22:04.822 --> 22:05.714
What do you mean?

22:05.715 --> 22:09.884
That was what she took
her last drink out of.

22:09.886 --> 22:11.753
She always had it on her.

22:13.655 --> 22:17.557
Said it was her way
of keeping an eye on her devil.

22:20.095 --> 22:21.628
Check this out.

22:21.630 --> 22:23.830
A visitor's pass
from Bedford Correctional

22:23.832 --> 22:25.265
from three days ago.

22:25.267 --> 22:27.434
Ellen visited Cerise Paxton.

22:27.436 --> 22:29.536
Why, do you think?

22:47.257 --> 22:48.924
Yeah, she came to see me.

22:49.745 --> 22:51.578
Said she wanted
to get me out of here.

22:51.580 --> 22:52.746
She tell you why?

22:52.748 --> 22:53.880
Said she thought she
and the other one

22:53.882 --> 22:55.181
set me up, so...
Hmm.

22:55.183 --> 22:56.683
You think that?

22:56.685 --> 22:58.150
Don't matter what I think.
What this about?

22:58.152 --> 23:02.422
She was found dead yesterday,
that's what it's about.

23:02.424 --> 23:05.624
Well, you know I
couldn't have done it.

23:05.626 --> 23:08.727
Did you get word to
anyone on the outside

23:08.729 --> 23:10.696
that she thought
that the real killer

23:10.698 --> 23:12.063
was still walking around free?

23:12.065 --> 23:13.098
Stupid woman.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.666
She talked foolish.

23:14.668 --> 23:16.502
If she really to help me,
she should've brought me

23:16.504 --> 23:18.437
chocolate and herb.
Come on.

23:18.439 --> 23:20.238
Did you get word to
anyone on the outside?

23:20.240 --> 23:21.506
What do you think,
we got cell phones?

23:21.508 --> 23:23.274
Answer the question.

23:23.276 --> 23:24.542
Or your manslaughter rap

23:24.544 --> 23:27.445
is gonna become accessory
to cop killer.

23:29.315 --> 23:31.949
Yeah, I got word.

23:31.951 --> 23:34.752
Now, look, if Chollie Tosh
find out I held out on him,

23:34.754 --> 23:36.687
I be praying they never
let me out.

23:36.689 --> 23:39.055
Chollie Tosh.

23:39.057 --> 23:41.024
He the one who committed the
murder you're in here for?

23:41.026 --> 23:44.127
You must really think
I'm stupid.

23:44.129 --> 23:45.729
Where can I find him?

23:45.731 --> 23:47.096
You can't.

23:47.098 --> 23:49.633
Him lay up in a different crib
all of the time.

23:49.635 --> 23:51.802
You do realize that
corrections officers

23:51.804 --> 23:54.237
don't take kindly
to cop killers either, right?

23:54.239 --> 23:56.138
Now, you can act
all tough all you want,

23:56.140 --> 23:58.507
but I promise you this.

23:58.509 --> 24:01.477
They find out who
you're covering for,

24:01.479 --> 24:03.979
you're gonna pray
that Tosh finds you first.

24:07.885 --> 24:11.086
Look, Sunup and Sundown
always know where he at.

24:11.088 --> 24:12.987
That's all I know them as.

24:12.989 --> 24:18.092
He and she.
Sunup and Sundown.

24:21.197 --> 24:23.698
Desmond Hill and Rita Brown.

24:23.700 --> 24:25.467
Alias Sundown and Sunup.

24:25.469 --> 24:26.901
Nah, Mon.

24:26.903 --> 24:27.969
You certain?

24:27.971 --> 24:29.636
Them no bother to me.

24:29.638 --> 24:31.037
We didn't ask if
they bothered you,

24:31.039 --> 24:32.238
just if you'd seen them.

24:32.240 --> 24:35.141
Both.

24:35.143 --> 24:36.477
Or neither.

24:36.479 --> 24:37.678
Whichever you like.

24:37.680 --> 24:39.480
Good day.

24:41.149 --> 24:44.284
Yeah, good day
to you, too.

24:44.286 --> 24:46.286
Well, that's strike 12.

24:46.288 --> 24:47.520
Well, let's go see the super.

24:47.522 --> 24:49.421
He's got to have those
surveillance tapes by now.

24:49.423 --> 24:50.857
Yeah.

24:50.859 --> 24:53.759
You know, maybe we shouldn't
show them as a pair anymore.

24:53.761 --> 24:55.394
- Why?
- You know how it is with couples.

24:55.396 --> 24:57.393
Sometimes you like one,
but not the other one.

24:58.099 --> 24:59.832
I don't know.

24:59.834 --> 25:02.702
Maybe we should
alternate 'em, you know?

25:02.704 --> 25:05.103
I'd say we start
with Sundown.

25:05.105 --> 25:07.506
He looks like somebody people
would want to get back at.

25:07.508 --> 25:09.073
I was thinking Sunup does.

25:09.075 --> 25:10.408
You think?
Yeah.

25:10.410 --> 25:12.511
Not so much.

25:40.639 --> 25:42.171
Police!

25:44.009 --> 25:45.575
Drop it!
I said drop it!

25:45.577 --> 25:47.376
Put it down.
You first.

25:47.378 --> 25:49.045
Drop it!

25:50.348 --> 25:52.982
Put the gun down right now.

26:06.564 --> 26:08.263
Gun.
Okay.

26:10.133 --> 26:11.766
Hey. Hey!

26:11.768 --> 26:14.168
Look at me.
Look at me.

26:14.170 --> 26:16.804
There are no cameras
in this elevator, okay?

26:16.806 --> 26:20.041
So unless you want to end up
dead, like your girlfriend,

26:20.043 --> 26:22.376
you're gonna tell me where
I can find Tosh right now.

26:22.378 --> 26:23.410
Where is he?!

26:23.412 --> 26:25.145
Hotel 8.

26:25.147 --> 26:27.915
Motel 8?
Which one?

26:27.917 --> 26:30.316
Which one?!
Hotel 8.

26:31.787 --> 26:34.821
Hey. Hey!

26:36.558 --> 26:38.625
He's gone.

26:47.635 --> 26:51.036
Deputy Chief Jackson regrets
he can't make it in here.

26:51.872 --> 26:54.807
What's that mean?

26:54.809 --> 26:59.277
He's “up to his ears
out at SOD headquarters

26:59.279 --> 27:01.480
and can't make time
to come in.”

27:01.482 --> 27:03.948
So he's ducking a
request from this office.

27:03.950 --> 27:05.717
Or he's just got
too much on his plate

27:05.719 --> 27:07.819
to come all the way in
from Floyd Bennett Field.

27:07.821 --> 27:10.187
Do you want me to clarify it
as a direct order?

27:10.189 --> 27:12.423
I want to clarify it
as an appointment

27:12.425 --> 27:16.327
for an apology... from me.

27:16.329 --> 27:18.029
How do you want me to word that?

27:18.031 --> 27:21.498
I don't.

27:21.500 --> 27:23.634
Sir?

27:23.636 --> 27:26.970
He said to me, rocking the boat
was not my style.

27:26.972 --> 27:29.606
He didn't mean it
as a compliment.

27:29.608 --> 27:31.474
It's not exactly an insult,
either.

27:31.476 --> 27:34.344
I was raised
by a Roman Catholic,

27:34.346 --> 27:35.946
with a cop for a father,

27:35.948 --> 27:38.380
schooled by Jesuits,
then by the Marines,

27:38.382 --> 27:40.816
and then I joined the NYPD.

27:42.186 --> 27:46.288
The creed of every significant
relationship and organization

27:46.290 --> 27:48.958
that informed my life...

27:48.960 --> 27:51.393
could be boiled down to

27:51.395 --> 27:54.395
toe the line, obey the rules...

27:56.366 --> 27:59.467
And don't rock the boat.

28:06.509 --> 28:08.677
You're the boss.

28:08.679 --> 28:10.944
The boss isn't supposed
to rock the boat.

28:10.946 --> 28:13.981
The boss is supposed
to steady the boat.

28:16.786 --> 28:19.720
So I should always do
what I'm supposed to do.

28:25.895 --> 28:28.260
Try him again and tell him

28:28.262 --> 28:33.332
clam pies from Zingoni's Pizza
will be joining the meeting.

28:33.334 --> 28:36.435
Tampering with food
and drink items?

28:36.437 --> 28:38.537
Falsifying official
department records?

28:38.539 --> 28:42.041
Internal Affairs takes this kind
of behavior very seriously.

28:42.043 --> 28:43.409
Do you understand that?

28:43.411 --> 28:44.610
Yes, sir.

28:44.612 --> 28:45.877
Copy that.

28:45.879 --> 28:47.145
Just for the record,

28:47.147 --> 28:48.213
the tampering with the drink

28:48.215 --> 28:52.184
accusation was false
and... proven to be so.

28:53.653 --> 28:55.921
Your last name ain't Kryptonite
to me, Officer Reagan.

28:55.923 --> 28:58.123
You understand that?
I got it.

28:58.125 --> 29:00.058
Got it?
Copy that, boss.

29:00.060 --> 29:02.026
So here's what's gonna happen,

29:02.028 --> 29:04.028
and I already cleared this
with your CO.

29:04.030 --> 29:05.996
Reagan, you're riding
with Patimkin.

29:05.998 --> 29:08.498
Janko, you're riding
with Welch.

29:08.500 --> 29:10.434
For the next 30 days.

29:10.436 --> 29:12.669
We got no room
for Hatfields and McCoys

29:12.671 --> 29:14.038
in this department,

29:14.040 --> 29:16.741
and <i>you</i> are all dispensable,

29:16.743 --> 29:19.542
and <i>you</i> are all interchangeable.

29:21.113 --> 29:23.146
Do you copy that?

29:23.148 --> 29:24.748
Copy that.

29:24.750 --> 29:25.882
Yes, sir.

29:27.219 --> 29:29.485
I'm gonna
go change.

29:34.692 --> 29:38.326
You notice how she didn't
respond to any of his barks?

29:38.328 --> 29:40.062
Notice he didn't bust her on it?

29:40.064 --> 29:43.165
She's an IA mole?

29:43.167 --> 29:44.933
My partner's a rat.

29:45.970 --> 29:48.536
Well, your partner, now.

29:48.538 --> 29:50.605
Nothing we can
do about it.

29:50.607 --> 29:53.875
Nope. Just got to eat it.

29:56.913 --> 29:59.480
What do you mean
it's not a Hotel 8?

29:59.482 --> 30:01.286
Well, when did they
change it to Kwik Stay?

30:01.310 --> 30:02.184
Danny...

30:02.185 --> 30:03.450
What do you mean they didn't?

30:03.452 --> 30:05.319
Okay,

30:05.321 --> 30:06.530
maybe I got some bad
information, I don't know.

30:06.554 --> 30:07.522
Reagan?

30:07.523 --> 30:09.056
Thanks. What?!

30:09.058 --> 30:10.523
He wasn't saying “Motel 8.”

30:10.525 --> 30:11.724
Then what was he saying?

30:11.726 --> 30:13.860
He was saying “Hotel Hate,”
with an “H.”

30:13.862 --> 30:15.028
A transcription
from a deposition

30:15.030 --> 30:16.930
from a Tosh
foot soldier,

30:16.932 --> 30:17.898
just last month.

30:17.900 --> 30:19.332
Look.

30:19.334 --> 30:20.934
“Where he goes
when things get hot

30:20.936 --> 30:23.203
“is an old bus garage
in Red Hook.

30:23.205 --> 30:24.545
They got the kitchen and
cots and all of that”.

30:24.569 --> 30:26.174
Did he name the crib?

30:26.175 --> 30:29.441
Uh, quote, “Tosh, he calls it
'Hotel Hate' 'cause he hates it

30:29.443 --> 30:31.076
when he has to hole up there”"
Right.

30:31.078 --> 30:32.411
But if the guy gave it up,

30:32.413 --> 30:34.446
Tosh would know, and he'd
stay away from the place.

30:34.448 --> 30:36.916
He's a C.I., he testified
in a sealed courtroom.

30:36.918 --> 30:38.550
Okay, do we have an
address for the place?

30:38.552 --> 30:40.552
894 Wolcott Street.

30:40.554 --> 30:43.555
Okay, let's track down this C.I.

30:48.995 --> 30:50.561
Your detail's
ready out front,

30:50.563 --> 30:52.263
ride time out to
E.S.U. Headquarters

30:52.265 --> 30:53.331
is about 40 minutes.

30:53.333 --> 30:54.665
Is he still in his office?

30:54.667 --> 30:56.201
Lieutenant Gormley's
giving his staff notice

30:56.203 --> 30:57.435
that you're heading
out there.

30:57.437 --> 30:58.502
Thank you.

30:58.504 --> 30:59.871
I've allowed a
half-hour on site

30:59.873 --> 31:00.938
and given the
mayor's office notice

31:00.940 --> 31:02.239
that you may be late
to the reception.

31:02.241 --> 31:04.741
Maybe we could we make
it a standing notice?

31:04.743 --> 31:05.742
Afraid not, sir.

31:05.744 --> 31:06.877
Boss, he's not there.

31:06.879 --> 31:08.745
Chief Jackson is out
on the field with his men

31:08.747 --> 31:10.513
getting ready to hit a location.
Where?

31:10.515 --> 31:11.481
Waiting on word.

31:11.483 --> 31:13.383
What's the operation?
A raid.

31:13.385 --> 31:14.451
Jackson said, quote,

31:14.453 --> 31:16.453
“I want to go out
at 90 miles an hour

31:16.455 --> 31:18.354
with my hair on fire.”

31:31.236 --> 31:32.735
They're forcing me
out next week.

31:32.737 --> 31:35.003
Turning 63.

31:35.005 --> 31:36.571
You'll be missed.

31:36.573 --> 31:38.273
Not as much as
I'll miss this.

31:41.544 --> 31:42.544
Hold on.

31:44.381 --> 31:46.147
Mind if I'm the first man in?

31:46.149 --> 31:47.849
Be my guest.

31:50.487 --> 31:51.819
Go, go!

32:09.154 --> 32:10.653
Commissioner.

32:10.655 --> 32:11.722
As you were.

32:11.724 --> 32:13.523
Sir.

32:13.525 --> 32:14.557
Carry on.

32:14.559 --> 32:15.792
Sir.

32:15.794 --> 32:16.993
Carry on.

32:24.435 --> 32:26.869
Chief Jackson.

32:29.573 --> 32:30.773
How are you doing?

32:30.775 --> 32:32.775
Better than the bad guys.

32:32.777 --> 32:34.243
How's the leg?

32:34.245 --> 32:36.477
Just nick in the leg.
It's more than a nick.

32:36.479 --> 32:37.846
Lucky.

32:37.848 --> 32:39.480
Nah.

32:39.482 --> 32:40.782
Just good at my job.

32:40.784 --> 32:43.651
And very lucky you didn't
cowboy your way

32:43.653 --> 32:45.353
into a permanent retirement.

32:45.355 --> 32:46.687
Detective Reagan had my back.

32:46.689 --> 32:49.290
And can you tell him thanks
if you see him before I do?

32:49.292 --> 32:51.126
I'll do that.

32:51.128 --> 32:54.762
Nice to have a Reagan
have my back when it counted.

32:59.235 --> 33:02.469
90 miles an hour
with your hair on fire?

33:02.471 --> 33:04.805
That's how I roll.

33:12.680 --> 33:14.113
So it's official, right?

33:14.115 --> 33:15.714
Yes. Truce.

33:15.716 --> 33:17.583
The Treaty
of the Twelfth Precinct.

33:17.585 --> 33:19.152
Signed and sealed.

33:19.154 --> 33:22.488
To be fair, that IA dick
did have a point.

33:22.490 --> 33:25.624
You start getting tangled up
in the one-upping

33:25.626 --> 33:27.592
with the pranks
and the practical jokes,

33:27.594 --> 33:29.795
you're bound
to take your eye off the ball.

33:29.797 --> 33:31.329
Easy there,
Girl Scout.

33:31.331 --> 33:32.630
I'm just saying.

33:32.632 --> 33:34.866
I'm so glad
you see it that way.

33:59.926 --> 34:02.959
Richie. Hey.

34:02.961 --> 34:05.094
Hey, Detective.

34:05.096 --> 34:07.030
You can call me Danny.

34:07.032 --> 34:09.232
Okay. Danny.
What's up?

34:09.234 --> 34:12.268
I just wanted to come by
and see how you're doing.

34:13.103 --> 34:15.871
Brought you this.

34:15.873 --> 34:18.273
New game in the stores.
Figured you might like it.

34:18.275 --> 34:19.708
Thank you.

34:21.511 --> 34:22.945
Was this your mom's?

34:22.947 --> 34:24.880
Well, I wish, but no.

34:27.150 --> 34:29.150
Hey, Russ.

34:29.152 --> 34:31.652
Hey, Danny.

34:31.655 --> 34:34.223
I'll get the last load,
you start putting it away?

34:34.225 --> 34:35.656
Copy that.

34:35.658 --> 34:36.824
Thanks for
stopping by.

34:36.826 --> 34:38.059
You bet.

34:39.896 --> 34:41.762
What's this?

34:41.764 --> 34:44.831
Well, I came clean with IA,

34:44.833 --> 34:47.534
which got me modified
pending investigation.

34:47.536 --> 34:49.237
Sorry to hear that.

34:49.239 --> 34:50.871
Yeah. It is what it is.

34:50.873 --> 34:53.206
I've been there.
So I talked

34:53.208 --> 34:55.641
to Richie, and we decided
I'd move in with him.

34:55.643 --> 34:57.443
Wow.

34:57.445 --> 35:00.313
Kind of help get us
both back on our feet.

35:00.315 --> 35:02.448
Look at you.
In the spirit

35:02.450 --> 35:04.150
of making amends...

35:04.152 --> 35:06.186
Kid needs a parent.

35:06.188 --> 35:08.954
And you're the guy
who was willing to step up.

35:08.956 --> 35:10.923
That door was open, yeah.

35:10.925 --> 35:13.458
Good for you.

35:15.029 --> 35:17.596
Really.

35:17.598 --> 35:19.598
Thanks, Danny.

35:20.467 --> 35:22.634
I'll see you around.

35:33.613 --> 35:36.814
<i>I think I should be allowed</i>
<i>to make a statement.</i>

35:36.816 --> 35:37.982
Is there a record of this?

35:37.984 --> 35:39.017
What do you mean?
Do you fill out

35:39.019 --> 35:40.251
any kind of account or report

35:40.253 --> 35:41.319
after the fact?

35:41.321 --> 35:42.420
If you're gonna throw a punch,

35:42.422 --> 35:44.087
there'll be paperwork.
Otherwise, no.

35:44.089 --> 35:45.046
I'm not joking, Frank.

35:45.070 --> 35:46.624
You want to say something
for the record?

35:46.625 --> 35:49.326
Yes. That I'm retiring
under protest,

35:49.328 --> 35:51.094
and seeking remedy

35:51.096 --> 35:52.862
through legal action
against this department,

35:52.864 --> 35:54.932
charging age discrimination.

35:54.934 --> 35:57.901
Thank you for your service,
Chief.

35:57.903 --> 36:00.102
Let's go. I'll walk you out.

36:01.372 --> 36:03.672
You are leaving
under protest,

36:03.674 --> 36:05.107
and threatening a lawsuit.

36:05.109 --> 36:08.877
I will escort you
out of the building. Let's go.

36:16.754 --> 36:18.586
Sir, your elevator is out.

36:18.588 --> 36:20.455
Since when?
Since now.

36:20.457 --> 36:21.990
You'll have to use the main.
Sorry.

36:21.992 --> 36:23.558
We're gonna have
to take a little walk.

36:23.560 --> 36:26.094
I came here on my own steam.
I can leave the same way.

36:26.096 --> 36:28.229
By the by, if you're
suing the NYPD,

36:28.231 --> 36:30.265
you're suing
the wrong people.

36:30.267 --> 36:32.800
The retirement mandate
comes from state law.

36:32.802 --> 36:34.435
You need to be suing Albany.

36:34.437 --> 36:36.670
Oh, we're looking at that.

36:36.672 --> 36:39.073
So are we.

36:39.075 --> 36:41.108
You are?

36:41.110 --> 36:43.310
Yes.

36:44.380 --> 36:47.381
I'm having Legal look
into what we have to do

36:47.383 --> 36:49.216
to remedy cases like yours.

36:49.218 --> 36:50.817
Are you now?

36:50.819 --> 36:52.385
Yes.

36:52.387 --> 36:54.854
Ten-hut!

37:07.869 --> 37:10.902
Just go with the flow
for once, will you?

38:16.266 --> 38:19.667
The first thing you miss when
you leave the job is the action.

38:19.669 --> 38:23.204
What are you gonna do when
you retire from One PP, Dad?

38:23.206 --> 38:24.805
Just retire.
Ha!

38:24.807 --> 38:26.274
Fat chance.

38:26.276 --> 38:27.641
You wouldn't last a week.

38:27.643 --> 38:29.243
Come on. Isn't there
something you've always

38:29.245 --> 38:31.345
secretly wanted to do?
There is.

38:31.347 --> 38:34.181
What?
Operative word-- secretly.

38:34.183 --> 38:36.015
- I love my second career.
- Yeah?

38:36.017 --> 38:37.016
What's your new career?

38:37.018 --> 38:39.018
Being patriarch of this family.

38:39.020 --> 38:40.187
What exactly does that entail?

38:40.189 --> 38:41.788
Don't encourage him.

38:41.790 --> 38:43.090
Using my vast experience

38:43.092 --> 38:45.092
and accrued wisdom to point out

38:45.094 --> 38:47.427
where you all are falling short.

38:48.830 --> 38:50.029
What about you, Dad?
I'm gonna go into

38:50.031 --> 38:51.130
the retirement business

38:51.132 --> 38:52.131
with Mr. Jimmy Buffett.

38:52.133 --> 38:53.466
What?
What?

38:53.468 --> 38:54.866
I'm serious.

38:54.868 --> 38:57.103
You realize there are millions
of baby boomers

38:57.105 --> 38:58.637
right now cashing out,
and they're gonna

38:58.639 --> 39:00.739
want a retirement
village of their own.

39:00.741 --> 39:02.374
- Hmm.
- What better place than Margaritaville?

39:02.376 --> 39:03.809
Mr. Buffett get back
to you on all this?

39:03.811 --> 39:05.777
He doesn't know about it yet, but...

39:05.779 --> 39:08.246
...I'm getting my ducks in a row.

39:08.248 --> 39:10.248
What about you, Mom?
What do you want to do?

39:10.250 --> 39:11.382
I'm gonna read every book

39:11.384 --> 39:12.850
I haven't had time to,

39:12.852 --> 39:16.654
and take wine-tasting
classes-- two a day.

39:16.656 --> 39:18.189
Ah.
Wine o'clock.

39:18.191 --> 39:21.493
Wildlife veterinarian
for the National Parks Service.

39:21.495 --> 39:23.561
That's cool.
Read an article in <i>National Geographic</i>

39:23.563 --> 39:25.195
when I was about ten,
never forgot it.

39:25.197 --> 39:26.830
There you go.

39:26.832 --> 39:28.898
Come on. What about you?

39:28.900 --> 39:30.467
What'll you do when you retire?

39:30.469 --> 39:32.503
Besides just being
a burden to my children?

39:32.505 --> 39:33.970
I thought that
was a hobby.

39:33.972 --> 39:35.005
Not that you're not good at it.

39:35.007 --> 39:36.540
Thank you very much.

39:36.542 --> 39:38.475
One thing I know for sure.

39:38.477 --> 39:41.344
On Sundays, I'll be right here,

39:41.346 --> 39:44.747
and I'll hope
all of you will be, too.
