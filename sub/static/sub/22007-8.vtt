WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:06.807
JEFF: Previously on
"survivor," after the merge,

00:06.840 --> 00:08.509
Cole was looking to get the
upper hand.

00:08.542 --> 00:12.246
I'm looking for a clue or
some advantage.

00:12.280 --> 00:15.049
JEFF: But the heroes and
hustlers came together.

00:15.083 --> 00:17.785
We need a healer gone first.

00:17.818 --> 00:21.189
JEFF: Putting the healers
on the wrong side of the

00:21.222 --> 00:22.190
numbers.

00:22.223 --> 00:25.959
Joe plays an idol, I think we
need a plan "b."

00:25.993 --> 00:29.029
JEFF: At tribal council,
Joe thought he was saving

00:29.063 --> 00:29.497
himself.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.699
That's for me.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.501
JEFF: But the real target
was Jessica.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.636
Jessica, the tribe has
spoken.

00:35.669 --> 00:39.373
JEFF: Thanks, Jeff.

00:39.407 --> 00:40.808
JEFF: 11 are left.

00:40.841 --> 00:51.285
Who will be voted out tonight?

00:59.327 --> 01:03.063
Now I know how it feels like
to be lied to by every single

01:03.097 --> 01:03.731
person.

01:03.764 --> 01:04.265
We're playing "survivor."

01:04.298 --> 01:06.867
That was magic.

01:06.900 --> 01:10.938
I know the hustlers wanted us
down to four to make it even,

01:10.971 --> 01:13.040
but I didn't see Jess.

01:13.073 --> 01:16.344
Jessica got completely blind
sided by the heroes and

01:16.377 --> 01:16.944
hustlers.

01:16.977 --> 01:18.346
That was an amazing play.

01:18.379 --> 01:20.881
As a fan, you got to appreciate
that.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.016
Y'all, that was genius.

01:23.050 --> 01:26.954
The only problem is now you're
playing with the devil.

01:26.987 --> 01:32.025
Lauren and I put a plan in
play, and we executed it.

01:32.059 --> 01:33.594
We got our target out.

01:33.627 --> 01:36.464
So now it was a good feeling.

01:36.497 --> 01:41.302
If I can keep the reins on this
hero-hustler group and get us to

01:41.335 --> 01:43.971
seven, I'm good, but I'm worried
about the individual part,

01:44.004 --> 01:54.047
because an individual can mess
this whole thing up.

01:54.047 --> 02:01.589
Because an individual can mess
this whole thing up.

02:01.622 --> 02:05.293
You know, when I woke up this
morning, it seemed like the end

02:05.326 --> 02:06.460
of the world.

02:06.494 --> 02:09.062
It was my first tribal and
everybody else had been through

02:09.096 --> 02:09.663
it, you know?

02:09.697 --> 02:12.533
And now I get it.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.735
Did you see that?

02:14.768 --> 02:16.170
Where did it go?

02:16.204 --> 02:22.710
That's crazy.

02:22.743 --> 02:28.382
This morning I reached into
where the nails were and a saw a

02:28.416 --> 02:30.351
little piece of paper rolled up
really tight.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.586
It's a hidden clue or something,
you know?

02:32.620 --> 02:36.690
I guess it's been there since we
merged, and then I was trying to

02:36.724 --> 02:38.726
make sure nobody was paying me
any attention.

02:38.759 --> 02:42.663
My heart started beating
probably 150 beats per second.

02:42.696 --> 02:46.099
Congratulations you have
found an advantage in the game.

02:46.133 --> 02:51.038
This advantage allows you to
secretly not vote at the next

02:51.071 --> 02:55.443
tribal council and instead save
your vote for use at a future

02:55.476 --> 02:56.710
tribal council.

02:56.744 --> 03:01.449
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS: When it is
your turn to vote, do not write

03:01.482 --> 03:03.217
down a name.

03:03.251 --> 03:07.788
Instead secretly place this note
inside the voting urn and take

03:07.821 --> 03:12.092
the blank voting parchment back
with you.

03:12.125 --> 03:15.963
So if I use it after tomorrow, i
can vote twice.

03:15.996 --> 03:19.467
The hard part is going to be
getting this advantage in the

03:19.500 --> 03:22.636
urn in front of ten other
people, and hopefully nobody

03:22.670 --> 03:25.005
will even know there was
somebody who didn't vote, but I

03:25.038 --> 03:28.509
need to make sure no one sees me
do it, because, you know, that

03:28.542 --> 03:32.212
could blow up my whole game.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:50.798 --> 04:02.776
JEFF: Come on in, guys.

04:02.810 --> 04:03.844
All right.

04:03.877 --> 04:06.146
You guys ready to get to today's
reward challenge in.

04:06.179 --> 04:07.381
Oh, yeah.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.783
JEFF: For today's challenge
you'll race up a tower through a

04:09.817 --> 04:13.721
series of obstacles to the top,
where you will use a slingshot

04:13.754 --> 04:21.995
to attempt to launch sandbags
hitting five targets.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.865
The first team to finish wins
reward.

04:24.898 --> 04:26.934
Want to know what your playing
for?

04:26.967 --> 04:31.271
The winning team will be taken
to a private island, where you

04:31.305 --> 04:33.273
will enjoy spaghetti.

04:33.307 --> 04:33.707
Oh.

04:33.741 --> 04:34.342
Wow.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.142
JEFF: Bread.

04:35.175 --> 04:36.310
Bread.

04:36.344 --> 04:37.445
JEFF: Salad.

04:37.478 --> 04:38.546
Oh, my god.

04:38.579 --> 04:39.313
JEFF: And red wine.

04:39.347 --> 04:41.081
No way.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.016
JEFF: There's a twist.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.252
We're going to randomly draw for
teams.

04:45.285 --> 04:49.590
The odd person out will not
compete in the challenge.

04:49.623 --> 04:50.724
Wow.

04:50.758 --> 04:54.027
JEFF: And they won't have
to, because as the survivor

04:54.061 --> 04:57.698
lottery winner, they will
automatically join the winning

04:57.731 --> 05:01.034
team and enjoy the reward
without doing anything.

05:01.068 --> 05:01.769
Wow.

05:01.802 --> 05:02.903
JEFF: All right.

05:02.936 --> 05:03.704
We'll get to this.

05:03.737 --> 05:07.975
The lottery.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.042
JEFF: All right.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.712
We have our two teams randomly
chosen.

05:11.745 --> 05:17.084
It is j.P., Chrissy, Cole, Ryan,
and Devon taking on Desi,

05:17.117 --> 05:22.089
Ashley, Ben, Dr. Mike, and
Lauren.

05:22.122 --> 05:24.992
Joe drew the white rock, which
means spaghetti coming his way

05:25.025 --> 05:27.728
with no effort required.

05:27.761 --> 05:28.529
Here we go.

05:28.562 --> 05:32.132
For reward, survivors ready?

05:32.165 --> 05:36.003
Go!

05:36.036 --> 05:39.507
With one person up at a time,
it's going to be Ben up first

05:39.540 --> 05:41.074
and Ryan, neck and neck.

05:41.108 --> 05:44.177
Everyone has to race through the
course and shoot at least once.

05:44.211 --> 05:47.114
Now you're up the more tricky
ladder, the rope ladder.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.216
Ben gets to the top quickly.

05:49.249 --> 05:49.650
Ryan right there.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.251
Start launching.

05:51.284 --> 05:55.623
Ben back quickly and releases.

05:55.656 --> 05:56.824
Just to the left.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.459
There goes Ryan.

05:58.492 --> 05:59.660
Falls short.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.994
He's going to head down.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.130
He doesn't have to shoot again.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.665
Ben quickly getting a feel for
it.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.234
Now he's zoned in on these
targets.

06:07.267 --> 06:08.936
Chrissy heading up for a clue.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.070
Ben fires again.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.605
Very quickly.

06:11.639 --> 06:12.573
Just to the right.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.408
It's now Chrissy for blue.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.143
Hard, Chrissy, hard.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.778
JEFF: Misses to the left.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.146
Chrissy now going to head down.

06:19.179 --> 06:19.980
She's taken her shot.

06:20.013 --> 06:23.884
Blue with a very interesting
strategy.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.586
Ben connects for red.

06:25.619 --> 06:29.289
Once you hit, you got to let
somebody else take a shot.

06:29.322 --> 06:32.159
It's now j.P. Up for blue.

06:32.192 --> 06:36.196
Ryan and Chrissy both took one
shot, trying to open the door

06:36.229 --> 06:39.299
for their experienced slingshot
slingers.

06:39.332 --> 06:40.734
Red with one.

06:40.768 --> 06:43.737
Blue looking for their first.

06:43.771 --> 06:44.938
Almost, j.T.

06:44.972 --> 06:49.777
JEFF: Dr. Mike going for a
close one, and he connects.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.679
That's two for red.

06:51.712 --> 06:52.980
J.P. Hits for blue.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.347
It is 2-1.

06:54.381 --> 06:56.484
Here comes Cole for blue.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.551
Lauren for red.

06:57.585 --> 07:01.154
Big reward on the line.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.756
Spaghetti on a private island.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.993
Lauren takes that slingshot
back.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.160
Lauren connects for red.

07:07.194 --> 07:09.597
That is three for red.

07:09.630 --> 07:12.933
The pressure on Cole, trying to
close this gap.

07:12.966 --> 07:15.936
Here comes Ashley now.

07:15.969 --> 07:18.238
Calories are important, and Cole
fires.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.973
No, Cole's going to come down.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.174
Here comes Devon.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.677
A massive setback for blue.

07:23.711 --> 07:26.780
Ashley's first shot short.

07:26.814 --> 07:31.151
Here goes Devon launching deep,
and he connects on his first

07:31.184 --> 07:32.953
shot for blue.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.622
Everybody has gone for blue.

07:34.655 --> 07:35.923
Now anybody can go.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.190
Here comes j.P.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.859
It is 3-2.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.861
Ashley still firing for red.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.596
She is short again.

07:42.630 --> 07:44.031
Further back, ash.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.734
JEFF: Come on, j.P.

07:46.767 --> 07:52.806
J.P. Looking the tag another one
right here.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.608
And 3-3, j.P. Heads down.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.977
Here comes Devon again.

07:57.010 --> 08:00.113
Ashley trying to put red back in
the lead.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.248
Can she do it?

08:01.281 --> 08:04.151
Just misses.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.385
It's Devon now for blue.

08:05.418 --> 08:08.656
We're tied 3-3.

08:08.689 --> 08:09.489
Devon connects.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.491
Blue in the lead now with four.

08:11.525 --> 08:13.661
Ashley now feeling the pressure.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.028
Here comes j.P.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.564
One more, baby.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.365
JEFF: He's been on fire in
this challenge.

08:18.398 --> 08:22.770
Can he close it out for blue
right here?

08:22.803 --> 08:25.072
Ashley's got to pick it up now.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.406
Come on, j.P.

08:26.439 --> 08:31.912
JEFF: J.P. Would like the
close the door with this shot.

08:31.945 --> 08:35.916
Ashley connects.

08:35.948 --> 08:37.717
JEFF: It won't matter.

08:37.751 --> 08:40.352
J.P. Wins it for blue.

08:40.386 --> 08:48.261
Huge reward for j.P., Devon,
Chrissy, Cole, and Ryan.

08:48.295 --> 08:53.066
And Joe will be joining them.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.034
All right.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.704
So there's something unique
about this reward.

08:56.737 --> 09:01.575
It's going to be served
family-style, which means one

09:01.609 --> 09:07.748
large portion to be shared, and
you will eat one person at a

09:07.781 --> 09:11.118
time alone in private.

09:11.151 --> 09:15.088
So it's up to you how much you
eat and save for the next

09:15.122 --> 09:19.426
person, and because it's in
private, nobody will ever know.

09:19.459 --> 09:20.728
I don't like that.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.930
JEFF: One final twist.

09:22.963 --> 09:27.500
Joe, as the survivor lottery
winner, you will decide in what

09:27.534 --> 09:29.803
order everyone eats, including
yourself.

09:29.837 --> 09:32.806
It should make for a very fun
afternoon.

09:32.840 --> 09:36.443
Grab your stuff, head out, enjoy
your reward.

09:36.476 --> 09:37.845
Oh, man.

09:37.878 --> 09:40.948
JEFF: Mike, Ashley, Ben,
Lauren, Desi, got nothing for

09:40.981 --> 09:41.749
you.

09:41.782 --> 09:42.916
Grab your stuff, head back to
camp.

09:42.950 --> 09:46.920
Right now I do have target on
my back, so I need to make

09:46.954 --> 09:49.189
adjustments in my game, and this
is a great opportunity to

09:49.222 --> 09:54.227
establish better relationships
and stronger alliances.

10:06.473 --> 10:10.343
So, guys, what I was thinking
was Devon goes first, because

10:10.377 --> 10:13.113
it's his birthday, and I didn't
do anything but sit there and

10:13.146 --> 10:15.182
got front-row seats, so I'll
definitely go last.

10:15.215 --> 10:18.451
I put myself last because i
don't want an additional power

10:18.485 --> 10:22.690
on my back, and who has the
power, the hustlers.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.058
I have a decent relationship
with Devon, so I gave him first

10:25.092 --> 10:26.259
dibs on eating.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.296
If I can continue developing a
relationship with Devon, that

10:29.329 --> 10:34.167
will benefit me definitely in
the long run.

10:34.201 --> 10:36.569
Oh, my god.

10:36.603 --> 10:39.172
This is like the perfect date
by myself.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.908
Oh, my gosh, there's tons.

10:40.941 --> 10:41.809
Oh.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.443
When I walked into that
spaghetti feast.

10:43.476 --> 10:46.346
I felt like there was a little
pressure on me being first one.

10:46.379 --> 10:50.617
Knowing that everyone else is
counting on me to set the bar

10:50.650 --> 11:00.360
for how much we're going to eat.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.398
Oh, man, I'm so happy right now.

11:05.432 --> 11:06.800
This is insane.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.937
So I was just shoving each bite
in my face.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.338
But I fell like I was fair.

11:11.371 --> 11:15.508
I mean, I might have eaten a
little more than my fair share.

11:15.542 --> 11:23.984
But when there's that much food,
it's hard to stop.

11:24.017 --> 11:27.855
I got to go eat second, but i
wouldn't have minded going last

11:27.888 --> 11:30.924
because if it's leftover, you
got to finish it off, but you

11:30.958 --> 11:33.660
want to make sure that everybody
gets their fair share and it all

11:33.693 --> 11:34.895
works out.

11:34.928 --> 11:38.165
All in all, by no means was i
fat and happy, but it is what it

11:38.198 --> 11:39.132
is.

11:39.166 --> 11:47.607
Take your portion and leave it
for next person.

11:47.640 --> 11:51.311
I think j.P. And Devon may
have indulged a little more than

11:51.344 --> 11:51.945
their fair share.

11:51.979 --> 11:53.146
I don't blame them.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.281
I'm going to do the same thing.

11:54.314 --> 11:57.384
I know I'm on the bottom, so
I'll get back to all these

11:57.417 --> 12:05.759
people that stabbed me in the
back and eat as much as I want.

12:05.793 --> 12:08.829
There's writing on the bottom
of the plate.

12:08.862 --> 12:12.766
It says that you have an idol
buried underneath your tribe

12:12.800 --> 12:13.867
flag.

12:13.901 --> 12:16.336
So I'm thinking I may be first
person to see this clue.

12:16.369 --> 12:20.507
I know I needed to find some way
the hide this clues.

12:20.540 --> 12:23.543
So I used an apron that was
wrapped around the bread and

12:23.576 --> 12:31.184
cover it up and make it look as
natural as possible.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.986
I didn't realize I don't get
a plate.

12:33.020 --> 12:36.423
I'm a student of this game
enough to know that there is

12:36.456 --> 12:40.093
generally a clue to be found at
a reward.

12:40.127 --> 12:43.696
So I begin the look at the
bottom of the salad bowl, unwrap

12:43.730 --> 12:44.998
the extra silverware.

12:45.032 --> 12:47.734
Kind of looked around, looked at
the trees around me.

12:47.767 --> 12:48.635
Didn't see a clue.

12:48.668 --> 12:58.445
So I continued to eat.

12:58.478 --> 13:02.515
There is a hidden immunity idol
buried under your tribe flag.

13:02.549 --> 13:03.483
Uh nigh it was here.

13:03.516 --> 13:06.219
I think I am the first one to
see this clue.

13:06.253 --> 13:13.126
And I'm hoping that Ryan will
also find the clue.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.928
Spaghetti is great.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.729
Kids clamor for the taste of
spaghetti.

13:16.763 --> 13:17.764
I like spaghetti.

13:17.797 --> 13:18.498
It's fine.

13:18.531 --> 13:19.466
Caesar salad is okay.

13:19.499 --> 13:26.073
But I was looking for a clue.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.240
Very direct.

13:27.274 --> 13:30.343
If you see this clue, you do not
have to be a mastermind to

13:30.377 --> 13:31.478
figure this out.

13:31.511 --> 13:37.784
So the less people who know
about the plate, the better.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.954
I have searched for the idol for
20-plus days now and got

13:40.988 --> 13:41.654
nothing.

13:41.688 --> 13:43.290
Now I know exactly where one is.

13:43.323 --> 13:47.861
So if I don't find it, I would
never be able to swallow that.

13:47.895 --> 13:49.729
Oh, here's Ryan.

13:49.762 --> 13:50.630
Oh, man.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.532
I'm out.

13:52.565 --> 13:53.300
I'm hungry, y'all.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.768
Lick that thing clean, bro.

13:55.802 --> 13:57.070
Don't leave a crumb.

13:57.104 --> 13:57.737
I won't.

13:57.770 --> 13:58.939
How was it for you?

13:58.972 --> 14:11.318
It was just the right amount
for me.

14:11.351 --> 14:18.525
What do we do?

14:18.558 --> 14:20.860
What's the whispering about?

14:20.894 --> 14:23.063
Just quiet whispers.

14:23.096 --> 14:23.897
Nothing really?

14:23.931 --> 14:24.965
Oh, yeah.

14:24.998 --> 14:27.367
Chrissy and Ryan were
definitely talking about the

14:27.400 --> 14:28.635
crew.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.870
There's nothing else they would
whisper that quietly about right

14:30.904 --> 14:32.039
next to me.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.707
I could definitely beat out
Chrissy and Ryan in a digging

14:34.741 --> 14:38.011
challenge, so if push comes to
shove, I'll have the bigger push

14:38.045 --> 14:41.014
and shove, and I don't feel bad
about going all out for the

14:41.048 --> 14:54.627
idol.

14:56.129 --> 15:00.433
Knowing that the immunity
idol is right under the flag, my

15:00.467 --> 15:02.035
heart is beating out of my
chest.

15:02.069 --> 15:06.906
I have to just wait for a moment
to break away.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.741
It wasn't a feast by any
means.

15:08.775 --> 15:10.210
We were eating off the same
plate.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.178
It was funny.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.713
Was there a lot of bread at
least or salads?

15:13.746 --> 15:17.317
There was a baggett that was
probably 12 inches.

15:17.350 --> 15:18.585
It was good, though.

15:18.618 --> 15:23.190
We were telling people about
the reward, and all of a sudden,

15:23.223 --> 15:27.527
Cole goes to pee, and I'm
thinking, this is it.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.862
This is where I have to strike.

15:29.896 --> 15:33.833
When Cole is literally caught
with his pants down, I'm going

15:33.866 --> 15:43.576
to dig up this idol.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.013
Did you portion it out?

15:46.046 --> 15:47.247
I guess some.

15:47.280 --> 15:51.218
I just took what I thought
was a sixth and trusted everyone

15:51.251 --> 15:59.092
else to do the same.

15:59.126 --> 16:00.593
Cover that back up.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.062
Cover that back up.

16:02.095 --> 16:11.904
I got it.

16:11.938 --> 16:16.743
Desi, Desi, come here, come
here.

16:16.776 --> 16:24.217
J.P., j.P.

16:24.251 --> 16:25.085
What's wrong?

16:25.118 --> 16:27.120
An idol.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.721
You're not going to wrestle
over this.

16:28.755 --> 16:33.760
I am standing there with the
idol in my little pink shorts,

16:33.793 --> 16:36.529
and pandemonium is ensuing in
front of me.

16:36.563 --> 16:39.132
Wait, why is everyone
digging.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.733
Cole, did you find the clue?

16:40.767 --> 16:41.801
Nobody knows what's going on.

16:41.834 --> 16:45.605
I was really the only one who
knew exactly what had

16:45.638 --> 16:46.005
transpired.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.074
Oh, my god.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.241
Oh, my god.

16:48.275 --> 16:51.511
Guys, you're about to kill
me, all for an idol.

16:51.544 --> 16:53.146
Cole's got it.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.947
He just shoved it down his
pants.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.416
I just saw him do it.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.351
He tucked his shirt.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.320
Cole is digging his own grave at
this point.

17:00.353 --> 17:03.556
You don't want your enemies to
know you have the idol.

17:03.590 --> 17:06.093
He blatantly went out there
running and started digging.

17:06.126 --> 17:10.163
Probably wasn't the smartest
thing, but Chrissy was going to

17:10.196 --> 17:11.131
get it if I didn't go.

17:11.164 --> 17:13.500
Well you got it now, and
everyone knows.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.634
So?

17:14.666 --> 17:16.935
What else was I going to do?

17:16.969 --> 17:18.371
I don't like Cole.

17:18.405 --> 17:19.906
He rubbed me the wrong way.

17:19.939 --> 17:22.575
If Cole has the idol, everyone
needs to know, because he's one

17:22.608 --> 17:24.377
of the main targets.

17:24.411 --> 17:27.347
I don't care, I'll blow his game
out.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.250
I saw you tuck your shirt
into your pants.

17:30.283 --> 17:31.851
It's a long shirt, dude.

17:31.884 --> 17:35.855
Why would you tuck your shirt
into your pants?

17:35.888 --> 17:38.191
Because it's like a dress.

17:38.225 --> 17:40.193
It's a complete disaster at this
point.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.695
Everyone thinks I have an idol,
but I don't have an idol.

17:42.729 --> 17:48.501
I feel like I'm in big trouble,
so bluffing I have the idol is

17:48.535 --> 17:50.002
the only thing I have left
unless I can win immunity.

17:50.036 --> 17:53.039
That would be a game changer for
me.

18:07.154 --> 18:17.964
JEFF: Come on in, guys!

18:17.997 --> 18:22.101
Shall we get to today's immunity
challenge?

18:22.135 --> 18:26.839
First things first, Desi, got to
take it back.

18:26.873 --> 18:33.012
Thank you.

18:33.045 --> 18:36.048
Once again immonti is back up
for grabs.

18:36.082 --> 18:39.952
For today's challenge, you're
going to stand on a narrow beam

18:39.986 --> 18:43.923
while balancing a statue with a
very long pole.

18:43.956 --> 18:47.194
At regular intervals you will
move further away from the

18:47.227 --> 18:48.795
statue, making it more
difficult.

18:48.828 --> 18:54.201
If at any point you drop off or
your statue falls, you're out.

18:54.234 --> 19:00.840
Last person left standing wins
immunity, safe at the vote.

19:00.873 --> 19:04.277
Losers tribal council where
somebody will be the eighth

19:04.311 --> 19:05.845
person voted out of this game.

19:05.878 --> 19:07.347
We'll draw for spots.

19:07.380 --> 19:13.019
We'll get started.

19:13.052 --> 19:13.553
All right.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.222
Here we go.

19:15.255 --> 19:19.492
Everybody is balancing their
statue.

19:19.526 --> 19:24.331
This challenge is now officially
on.

19:24.364 --> 19:27.234
You'll be in this section for
ten minutes.

19:27.267 --> 19:31.504
Then we will move further back
on the beam.

19:31.538 --> 19:36.175
It does not taking much to knock
that statue over.

19:36.209 --> 19:40.046
One little movement and your
game could be over.

19:40.079 --> 19:43.383
I have a bug crawling right
up my body.

19:43.416 --> 19:44.851
Smack it.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.819
JEFF: Seems to be a theme
in this challenge.

19:46.853 --> 19:57.297
Last time we did this there were
ants crawling on people.

19:57.330 --> 20:00.099
Mike drops, first person out of
this challenge.

20:00.132 --> 20:02.402
No shot at immunity.

20:02.435 --> 20:08.708
Mike takes a spot on the bench.

20:08.741 --> 20:12.178
Joe out of nowhere drops.

20:12.211 --> 20:12.879
Had had no movement.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.748
Joe is out; No shot at immunity.

20:15.782 --> 20:16.383
She's vulnerable at tribal.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.717
You're killing me, Jeff.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.919
JEFF: We're down to nine.

20:19.952 --> 20:22.555
You're trying to find some sweet
spot without taking your

20:22.589 --> 20:29.195
concentration off that beam that
you're standing on.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.765
Devon falls off the beam,
becomes the third person out of

20:32.799 --> 20:33.800
this challenge.

20:33.833 --> 20:38.838
We are down to eight, and as
always, at an immunity

20:38.871 --> 20:42.008
challenge, the only way to
guarantee you see tomorrow is to

20:42.041 --> 20:43.876
win.

20:43.910 --> 20:47.414
Ryan, that heartis beating
through your chest.

20:47.447 --> 20:51.884
I can see it.

20:51.918 --> 20:55.054
Lauren with one little movement
drops her statue.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.423
Lauren is out.

20:56.456 --> 21:04.597
We are now down to seven left in
this challenge.

21:04.631 --> 21:08.067
Ryan can't hang in anymore, an
we are down to six.

21:08.100 --> 21:11.838
Another five minutes to go in
this round, and we will move

21:11.871 --> 21:21.914
further back on the beam.

21:21.914 --> 21:29.389
Further back on the beam.

21:29.422 --> 21:33.360
Everybody has now
moved back one

21:33.393 --> 21:34.226
section.

21:34.260 --> 21:38.665
Ben, Desi, Cole, Chrissy, j.P.,
Ashley.

21:38.698 --> 21:44.504
That beam very narrow, very
tough to keep your balance.

21:44.537 --> 21:47.674
Ashley only lasts a couple of
seconds in this section.

21:47.707 --> 21:52.178
We're down to five people left
now in this immunity challenge.

21:52.211 --> 22:01.220
This is where it gets very, very
difficult.

22:01.253 --> 22:06.793
Ben now with a little bit of
movement.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.396
Ben got it back under control.

22:09.429 --> 22:13.132
Nice recovery.

22:13.165 --> 22:17.404
J.P. Struggling with the feet.

22:17.437 --> 22:21.474
J.P. Trying to get it back under
control.

22:21.508 --> 22:27.447
Nice recovery, and j.P.'S back
solid.

22:27.480 --> 22:33.986
Cole's feet moving.

22:34.020 --> 22:34.721
Cole recovers.

22:34.754 --> 22:35.422
Nice work.

22:35.455 --> 22:40.326
That's what you got to do.

22:40.359 --> 22:44.363
Chrissy out of nowhere, looked
very solid, and drops.

22:44.397 --> 22:46.165
We're down to four.

22:46.198 --> 22:51.704
It is Ben, Desi, Cole, and j.P.

22:51.738 --> 22:55.675
Desi won the first individual
immunity, and she is in the

22:55.708 --> 23:02.949
running again.

23:02.982 --> 23:05.017
Ben cannot hang on any longer.

23:05.051 --> 23:08.254
Ben drops, and we are down to
three.

23:08.287 --> 23:15.528
It is Desi on one end, Cole and
j.P. At the other end.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.129
Desi looking very solid.

23:17.163 --> 23:21.000
No expression.

23:21.033 --> 23:23.069
Cole locked in.

23:23.102 --> 23:32.144
J.P. Feet still moving.

23:32.178 --> 23:32.979
Desi drops.

23:33.012 --> 23:35.948
Desi will not keep her streak
alive.

23:35.982 --> 23:39.051
We are down to two.

23:39.085 --> 23:42.889
Cole and j.P.

23:42.922 --> 23:47.760
J.P. With a huge recovery, a lot
of movement on that statue.

23:47.794 --> 23:50.563
J.P. Struggling to stay up
there.

23:50.597 --> 23:51.931
You got it.

23:51.964 --> 23:54.066
JEFF: His statue has moved
a lot.

23:54.100 --> 24:00.507
That base is now on the edge.

24:00.540 --> 24:01.874
Another nice save by j.P.

24:01.908 --> 24:06.345
Now Cole is moving.

24:06.378 --> 24:15.321
More movement now by Cole.

24:15.354 --> 24:20.893
Cole still moving.

24:20.927 --> 24:23.996
J.P. Dangerously close to
falling out, and he does.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.565
J.P. Is out.

24:25.598 --> 24:29.869
Cole wins individual immunity,
safe tonight at tribal council.

24:29.902 --> 24:39.912
Cannot be voted out of this
game.

24:39.946 --> 24:43.349
[APPLAUSE]
Cole, come on over.

24:43.382 --> 24:44.016
Nice job.

24:44.050 --> 24:45.251
I'm having trouble walking.

24:45.284 --> 24:47.654
JEFF: Really, legs are
still rubbing?

24:47.687 --> 24:48.688
I got those chicken legs.

24:48.721 --> 24:50.222
JEFF: Cole safe tonight at
tribal council.

24:50.256 --> 24:51.323
Cannot be voted out.

24:51.357 --> 24:57.129
As for everyone else, 21 days
into a 39-day adventure,

24:57.163 --> 24:59.131
somebody will become the eighth
person voted out.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.600
It will not be you.

25:00.633 --> 25:01.400
Congrats.

25:01.433 --> 25:02.835
Grab your stuff, head back to
camp.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.771
See you tonight at tribal
council.

25:04.804 --> 25:07.607
It totally sucks that Cole
won immunity.

25:07.640 --> 25:10.810
But we still have three other

25:10.843 --> 25:14.847
the hustlers and the heroes just
is

25:14.881 --> 25:18.551
have to decide who we want to
vote out next.

25:29.128 --> 25:34.100
Good job, Cole.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.302
My toe is on fire.

25:36.335 --> 25:39.706
Well done.

25:39.739 --> 25:42.274
The immunity challenge was
the bomb.

25:42.308 --> 25:43.375
I came out on top.

25:43.409 --> 25:44.276
I have new life.

25:44.310 --> 25:46.045
I am so stoked to be here again.

25:46.078 --> 25:47.980
I was getting pretty bummed out.

25:48.014 --> 25:50.617
I was thinking I was leaving
tonight, so to win that

25:50.650 --> 25:53.586
challenge put me on top of the
world, however, I definitely

25:53.620 --> 25:57.189
feel like the healers a sinking
ship at this point, and if we

25:57.223 --> 26:03.630
don't do something soon, we're
going to be in a bad, bad place.

26:03.663 --> 26:05.231
Now what?

26:05.264 --> 26:06.933
We're good.

26:06.966 --> 26:13.840
All the girls vote Joe, and
all the guys vote for Desi.

26:13.873 --> 26:16.042
Cole winning immunity changes
everything.

26:16.075 --> 26:19.545
The plan is to switch the vote
between Joe and Desi.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.948
The fact he's already found and
played two idols.

26:21.981 --> 26:25.584
Joe is a gamer, and the longer
Joe stays in the game, the more

26:25.618 --> 26:28.387
chance he has to find another
one.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.857
And Desi, she's physically
strong.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.124
She's mentally strong.

26:32.158 --> 26:35.294
And she can compete with the
best of us.

26:35.327 --> 26:39.065
We can't put all our eggs in one
basket, because Desi will

26:39.098 --> 26:39.398
compete.

26:39.431 --> 26:40.800
I know.

26:40.833 --> 26:41.567
Desi's strong.

26:41.600 --> 26:42.735
So you feel confident?

26:42.769 --> 26:47.173
Well, it's survivor and
anything can happen, but I think

26:47.206 --> 26:53.079
we'll be good.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.948
Dude, I don't have an idol.

26:55.982 --> 26:56.382
Damn.

26:56.415 --> 27:01.754
Sorry.

27:01.788 --> 27:05.124
With Cole off the chopping
block, they're probably trying

27:05.157 --> 27:08.194
to vote me out, but I still have
angles to play, because at this

27:08.227 --> 27:13.132
point it's four healers, four
heroes, and it's a matter of who

27:13.165 --> 27:14.667
we can sway to the hustlers.

27:14.701 --> 27:16.703
So what do you think the plan
should be?

27:16.736 --> 27:20.873
I think the heroes think i
have an idol I might play for

27:20.907 --> 27:22.308
somebody, so they may split
votes.

27:22.341 --> 27:25.978
If they split and vote, we need
one person to vote.

27:26.012 --> 27:34.186
We can send someone home.

27:34.220 --> 27:36.823
Here's the thing, who is
calling the shots right now is

27:36.856 --> 27:39.759
the concern that I've had since
the very beginning.

27:39.792 --> 27:43.830
I understand it's easy to vote
me out because Ben is calling

27:43.863 --> 27:46.665
the shots, I don't understand
how everyone is allowling Ben to

27:46.699 --> 27:47.900
regulate.

27:47.934 --> 27:50.236
The dude is just running this
thing, and it's kind of like, if

27:50.269 --> 27:53.405
you all go to the final three,
I'm letting you all know, you

27:53.439 --> 27:54.540
are not going to beat Ben.

27:54.573 --> 27:55.241
Yeah.

27:55.274 --> 27:57.009
What Joe is pitching is true.

27:57.043 --> 28:00.012
If Ben gets to the final three,
he very well could win.

28:00.046 --> 28:01.247
He's got a great story.

28:01.280 --> 28:04.283
He's a former marine, and he's
just a good guy.

28:04.316 --> 28:07.720
So I don't want the take Ben to
the final three, however, if I

28:07.754 --> 28:11.290
vote off Ben, that would be
betraying Chrissy, who really

28:11.323 --> 28:14.426
trusts me, so now is not the
right time.

28:14.460 --> 28:15.828
Something to think about.

28:15.862 --> 28:16.729
Yeah.

28:16.763 --> 28:18.530
I'm going to go figure out
some stuff.

28:18.564 --> 28:19.866
All right.

28:19.899 --> 28:24.270
Just like I thought, Joe is
trying to put a target on my

28:24.303 --> 28:25.237
back.

28:25.271 --> 28:25.905
Nope.

28:25.938 --> 28:30.342
I really don't like that guy.

28:30.376 --> 28:34.613
Joe-Joe, what are you doing
tonight, bud?

28:34.646 --> 28:35.447
Playing another idol?

28:35.481 --> 28:36.182
Maybe.

28:36.215 --> 28:36.983
I don't know.

28:37.016 --> 28:38.684
We'll see what happens.

28:38.717 --> 28:42.789
There are bigger threats than
just an idol hog like myself.

28:42.822 --> 28:43.990
There are people that lie.

28:44.023 --> 28:45.657
There are people that swear on
things.

28:45.691 --> 28:47.827
You swore on your marines to
three different people.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.395
Who?

28:49.428 --> 28:49.896
Who?

28:49.929 --> 28:50.763
Who?

28:50.797 --> 28:51.397
No I didn't.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.866
I'm not going to go back.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.234
I'm telling you I didn't.

28:55.267 --> 28:58.304
I did not swear on the marine
corps to anyone, so if people

28:58.337 --> 29:00.106
are saying, that they're lying
to you.

29:00.139 --> 29:01.607
And I'm being serious now.

29:01.640 --> 29:02.574
Now I'm talking.

29:02.608 --> 29:04.676
Ben came up to me real cocky
and confident.

29:04.710 --> 29:06.078
I didn't like it.

29:06.112 --> 29:09.481
So I'm thinking he's always
saying I'm marine, you know,

29:09.515 --> 29:12.451
this and that, you know, so i
told him, you know, you're going

29:12.484 --> 29:13.585
around swearing on your marine.

29:13.619 --> 29:15.654
He's like, I have never done
that.

29:15.687 --> 29:19.691
Maybe he didn't directly say, "i
swear on my marine," but it

29:19.725 --> 29:20.960
doesn't matter.

29:20.993 --> 29:24.630
I know I'm in trouble, so I got
to do what I can to blow up his

29:24.663 --> 29:24.964
game.

29:24.997 --> 29:26.332
Listen.

29:26.365 --> 29:27.299
No, you listen.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.201
Why are you getting all
upset.

29:29.235 --> 29:34.206
Because instead of asking me
about it and talking to me about

29:34.240 --> 29:36.075
it, you're telling people.

29:36.108 --> 29:36.909
Are they yelling?

29:36.943 --> 29:38.010
Uh-huh.

29:38.044 --> 29:39.178
They have a rivalry.

29:39.211 --> 29:40.847
Don't get upset.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.182
There's no reason to get amped
up, dude.

29:43.215 --> 29:44.783
I think that's your game, and
that's cool.

29:44.817 --> 29:46.652
Joe pushed the right button.

29:46.685 --> 29:50.356
I take what I did in the marine
corps very serious.

29:50.389 --> 29:52.825
And I'm still dealing with with
it.

29:52.859 --> 29:58.097
There's things I have to live
with every day, and thoughts

29:58.130 --> 30:02.034
that I have every single day,
and for some puts like him to

30:02.068 --> 30:06.738
sit there and tell people that i
swore on it, it pisses me off.

30:06.772 --> 30:08.307
I didn't swear on the marine
corps.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.209
All right.

30:10.242 --> 30:11.743
I hope you didn't.

30:11.777 --> 30:12.544
That's all I'm saying.

30:12.578 --> 30:14.180
I don't give a damn.

30:14.213 --> 30:18.084
I know you don't, when
someone swears on the marines,

30:18.117 --> 30:19.185
they don't give a damn.

30:19.218 --> 30:20.586
Yeah, they're fighting.

30:20.619 --> 30:21.753
Are they really?

30:21.787 --> 30:23.555
Joe is just sitting there.

30:23.589 --> 30:25.757
Ben is the more demonstrative
one.

30:25.791 --> 30:28.494
I don't know.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.096
Joe just causing trouble at
camp.

30:30.129 --> 30:31.663
It's certainly unsettling.

30:31.697 --> 30:35.001
I hope he knows what he's doing,
because I realize there is a

30:35.034 --> 30:38.004
target at my back, but Joe's
instincts have worked well up to

30:38.037 --> 30:41.207
this point, so this could either
work out really well for me or

30:41.240 --> 30:47.146
really badly for me.

30:47.179 --> 30:50.482
I found a secret advantage
out there.

30:50.516 --> 30:53.852
I have to tell you this, because
there's in way we're going to be

30:53.886 --> 30:55.687
able to do split votes now.

30:55.721 --> 30:57.323
There's not?

30:57.356 --> 31:00.026
Not with the secret
advantage?

31:00.059 --> 31:03.029
I decided to tell Ben about the
secret advantage, because if I

31:03.062 --> 31:07.666
play it and don't vote, then it
would be three votes Joe, three

31:07.699 --> 31:10.903
Desi, and the healers could use
their four votes to vote out one

31:10.937 --> 31:11.737
of us.

31:11.770 --> 31:13.205
What does your secret
advantage say?

31:13.239 --> 31:19.745
If I use it today, I can vote
twice.

31:19.778 --> 31:23.115
I'm solid with Ben, however, I'm
playing this game for myself and

31:23.149 --> 31:27.253
for my daughter, and having that
extra vote could get me to the

31:27.286 --> 31:30.156
final three, so I've got to make
a big decision.

31:30.189 --> 31:33.659
But this could create a huge
problem for us.

31:33.692 --> 31:36.162
It's a blessing and a curse that
she found it.

31:36.195 --> 31:39.865
But right now I'm worried that
yes's got another idol, so we

31:39.898 --> 31:42.134
have to split the vote.

31:42.168 --> 31:43.069
But get the numbers.

31:43.102 --> 31:46.605
I have to convince a healer to
come with us.

31:46.638 --> 31:48.474
We're going to need you on board
with this one.

31:48.507 --> 31:50.542
I want Joe gone.

31:50.576 --> 31:54.046
I can't stand to be on this
island with him any longer, but

31:54.080 --> 31:56.215
if you don't vote with us
tonight, I'm going home.

31:56.248 --> 31:57.950
Who is going to vote for you?

31:57.984 --> 32:01.320
Joe, Desi, and Cole.

32:01.353 --> 32:03.255
But that's only three.

32:03.289 --> 32:06.192
Right, but if something
screwy happens, my name is down.

32:06.225 --> 32:09.828
For some reason Ben feels he
needs me to vote out Joe.

32:09.861 --> 32:11.230
It doesn't make sense.

32:11.263 --> 32:15.334
I don't know what's going on,
but if I show my allegiance to

32:15.367 --> 32:18.037
Ben, this could be my moment to
get off the bottom.

32:18.070 --> 32:22.408
At at the same time, this could
be a perfect opportunity to take

32:22.441 --> 32:24.210
out the biggest threat in this
game.

32:24.243 --> 32:25.177
And that's Ben.

32:25.211 --> 32:27.679
I worry that they're just
lying to me again.

32:27.713 --> 32:29.681
I don't know.

32:29.715 --> 32:32.284
Obviously if Joe goes home,
you're next.

32:32.318 --> 32:34.186
And then after you is me.

32:34.220 --> 32:35.321
You know?

32:35.354 --> 32:38.890
If this don't work, I might
be screwed.

32:38.924 --> 32:41.693
It's a game of Russian roulette.

32:41.727 --> 32:44.730
I've just put one round in the
chamber, spun it, and hopefully

32:44.763 --> 32:54.806
the hammer doesn't go down on me
tonight.

32:54.806 --> 33:05.251
The hammer doesn't go down on me
tonight.

33:05.284 --> 33:07.219
JEFF: All right, so, Joe,
last tribal council you played

33:07.253 --> 33:10.322
out hot, played an idol,
survived the vote.

33:10.356 --> 33:12.391
Is it fair the say you might
feel some heat?

33:12.424 --> 33:15.727
Jeff, tell me a time I've
been at tribal when I haven't

33:15.761 --> 33:16.828
felt the heat.

33:16.862 --> 33:17.596
Hasn't happened.

33:17.629 --> 33:18.930
This tribal is no different.

33:18.964 --> 33:20.932
There's one person running this
game right new and that's Ben.

33:20.966 --> 33:22.568
JEFF: Ben?

33:22.601 --> 33:26.872
You know, Jeff, apparently i
am a threat to Joe, but our

33:26.905 --> 33:29.141
alliance is not a one-person
alliance.

33:29.175 --> 33:31.677
We sit like the knights of a
roundtable.

33:31.710 --> 33:34.380
There's a bunch of other people
here that will have my back,

33:34.413 --> 33:36.182
just like I have theirs.

33:36.215 --> 33:38.850
JEFF: Cole, do you read
anything into the last vote in

33:38.884 --> 33:42.621
terms of the healers being the
target, or was Jessica just one

33:42.654 --> 33:44.823
vote and tonight could be
completely different?

33:44.856 --> 33:47.025
The healers are absolutely a
target.

33:47.059 --> 33:53.965
It's kind of silly for us to buy
into the lie of the people that

33:53.999 --> 33:54.766
flipped.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.268
JEFF: Joe, why are you
laughing?

33:56.302 --> 33:58.670
I called it since day one.

33:58.704 --> 34:01.540
Really, you're allowing Ben out
of all people to disrupt this?

34:01.573 --> 34:04.443
We healers we thought we were
strong, but we became weaker

34:04.476 --> 34:06.512
when we allowed Ben to cause
chaos.

34:06.545 --> 34:09.715
Jeff, this is always coming
from a guy who said I was

34:09.748 --> 34:11.217
swearing on the marines.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.185
I would never swear on the
marines.

34:13.219 --> 34:19.391
No one knows sacrifices that
marines make every single day,

34:19.425 --> 34:21.493
and so I got a little heated
today.

34:21.527 --> 34:22.694
I'm apologizing right now.

34:22.728 --> 34:25.464
Joe pushed my button, like he
was probably trying to do.

34:25.496 --> 34:27.833
I wasn't trying to push your
button.

34:27.866 --> 34:29.400
Let me finish, please.

34:29.435 --> 34:31.637
I'm not pushing buttons.

34:31.670 --> 34:32.670
Stop talking.

34:32.704 --> 34:34.239
None of us want to listen to you
anymore.

34:34.273 --> 34:36.208
Fair enough.

34:36.242 --> 34:37.576
JEFF: Wow.

34:37.609 --> 34:40.846
Ashley, it is interesting that
one guy can get so many people

34:40.879 --> 34:42.047
emotional.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.116
It's really hard to say if
Joe is really good at playing

34:44.150 --> 34:47.853
this game or if he's just really
good at being very annoyling

34:47.886 --> 34:48.687
honestly.

34:48.719 --> 34:50.021
I think it's a combination of
both.

34:50.054 --> 34:53.192
It's hard to tell.

34:53.225 --> 34:56.195
JEFF: Desi, it's
interesting that Joe could

34:56.228 --> 34:57.129
ultimately impact you.

34:57.163 --> 34:59.198
You were a healer in the
beginning, as well.

34:59.231 --> 35:01.900
I think Joe has been
consistent in his game play, and

35:01.933 --> 35:06.372
I think the issue here is people
manipulate words to mean what

35:06.405 --> 35:07.939
they want it to mean in that
moment.

35:07.973 --> 35:10.176
If you look at it one way, it's
the truth.

35:10.209 --> 35:13.078
If you look at it the other way,
it's a lie.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.581
JEFF: Mike, the game just
keeps ratcheting up.

35:15.614 --> 35:19.951
At the end of the day, i
don't know if any of this

35:19.985 --> 35:23.289
changes how people are voting or
not, but you feel like you can't

35:23.322 --> 35:24.356
trust people.

35:24.390 --> 35:29.461
Last tribal council, what
happened with our new yawa

35:29.495 --> 35:30.662
alliance?

35:30.696 --> 35:33.699
Your feelings get hurt and you
feel like you've been betray.

35:33.732 --> 35:34.700
It's tough.

35:34.733 --> 35:37.869
JEFF: Ben, where do you
weigh in on this?

35:37.903 --> 35:39.671
I have been through much worse.

35:39.705 --> 35:40.739
I'll try to find the clarity.

35:40.772 --> 35:44.109
Jeff, I've been through a
lot, like any other vet.

35:44.142 --> 35:47.646
We've had the keep our heads
cool and probably the most high,

35:47.679 --> 35:52.083
intense, dangerous situations,
and it's very easy to get

35:52.117 --> 35:53.185
overwhelmed.

35:53.219 --> 35:57.523
After getting out, I've gone
through a lot of personal

35:57.556 --> 35:58.557
growth.

35:58.590 --> 36:01.193
To this day I'm still working on
things like anger.

36:01.227 --> 36:05.231
That's why I truly apologize to
Joe, not because he was trying

36:05.264 --> 36:09.134
to get me angry, but because i
let him get me that angry.

36:09.167 --> 36:12.003
JEFF: Desi, "survivor" can
bring out the worst in you, or

36:12.037 --> 36:14.506
you can say "survivor"
challenges you.

36:14.540 --> 36:17.142
It gives you the chance to fight
to be your best.

36:17.175 --> 36:21.380
That's one way to look at it,
but I would guess that people

36:21.413 --> 36:24.883
would say that lying is not a
part of the best version of

36:24.916 --> 36:27.286
themselves, and I also think
that there are a lot of people

36:27.319 --> 36:31.056
sitting here who to some degree
in this game have told at least

36:31.089 --> 36:32.724
one if not several lies.

36:32.758 --> 36:36.194
So you have to decide where you
draw your moral line.

36:36.228 --> 36:38.930
DREW: Which speaks to some
level of character that you guys

36:38.964 --> 36:42.934
are all aware of, but you're
fighting this dilemma.

36:42.968 --> 36:44.470
Devon, where do you weigh in on
this?

36:44.503 --> 36:49.541
I think this game just strips
us down.

36:49.575 --> 36:50.742
We really are exposed.

36:50.776 --> 36:53.144
Today at camp we got back from
the immunity challenge.

36:53.178 --> 36:56.081
I was just laying in the shelter
like Ben, just boom.

36:56.114 --> 36:57.316
I don't want to be like that.

36:57.349 --> 37:02.654
I feel like I'm always positive,
high energy person, loving to

37:02.688 --> 37:05.023
smile and laugh and just have a
good time all the time.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.925
I don't want to be a zombie.

37:06.958 --> 37:09.728
I like being a bright and
beautiful light.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.797
I don't even know what I'm
talking about now.

37:11.830 --> 37:14.099
JEFF: I think you know
exactly what you're talking

37:14.132 --> 37:14.633
about.

37:14.666 --> 37:15.867
You got it, Devon.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.604
JEFF: Fascinating.

37:18.637 --> 37:19.771
Started tribal attack.

37:19.805 --> 37:24.142
Then it went deeper and it got
personal, and yet once again

37:24.175 --> 37:29.180
we're going to do the thing we
do, is vote, and it will all

37:29.214 --> 37:31.350
crystallize again.

37:31.383 --> 37:34.019
That was an amazing journey.

37:34.052 --> 37:34.786
[LAUGHTER]
Wow.

37:34.820 --> 37:37.022
Roller coaster, you could
say.

37:37.055 --> 37:37.923
JEFF: All right.

37:37.956 --> 37:39.257
Time to vote.

37:39.291 --> 37:42.294
J.P., you're up.

38:38.249 --> 38:45.524
JEFF: I'll go tally the
votes.

38:45.557 --> 38:47.659
If anybody has a hidden immunity
idol and you want the play it,

38:47.693 --> 38:52.297
now would be the time to do so.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.264
Okay.

38:53.298 --> 38:54.833
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.

38:54.866 --> 38:57.302
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the tribal

38:57.335 --> 38:58.637
council area immediately.

38:58.670 --> 39:02.641
I'll read the votes.

39:02.674 --> 39:06.878
First vote Ben.

39:06.912 --> 39:10.782
Lauren.

39:10.816 --> 39:14.620
Desi.

39:14.653 --> 39:15.821
Joe.

39:15.854 --> 39:19.458
That's one vote Ben, one vote
Lauren, one vote Desi, one vet

39:19.491 --> 39:21.727
Joe.

39:21.760 --> 39:22.160
Desi.

39:22.193 --> 39:24.663
Two votes Desi.

39:24.696 --> 39:25.163
Joe.

39:25.196 --> 39:28.867
Two votes Joe.

39:28.900 --> 39:29.435
Desi.

39:29.468 --> 39:34.740
That's three votes Desi.

39:34.773 --> 39:35.273
Joe.

39:35.306 --> 39:36.074
We're tied again.

39:36.107 --> 39:41.112
Three votes Desi, three votes
Joe.

39:41.146 --> 39:41.680
Desi.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.148
That's four votes Desi.

39:43.181 --> 39:46.017
Three votes Joe, one vote Ben,
one vote Lauren.

39:46.051 --> 39:52.858
One vote left.

39:52.891 --> 39:53.725
Joe.

39:53.759 --> 39:54.593
We're tied.

39:54.626 --> 39:57.563
That's four votes Joe, four
votes Desi.

39:57.596 --> 39:58.897
Here's how it's going to work.

39:58.930 --> 40:02.701
We're going to revote, Desi and
Joe, you will not vote.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.770
Everybody else here, you can
only vote for Desi or Joe.

40:04.803 --> 40:07.806
J.P., do you want the come grab
the urn?

40:40.639 --> 40:48.013
I'll go tally the votes.

40:48.046 --> 40:52.450
I'll read the votes.

40:52.484 --> 40:56.021
First vote Desi.

40:56.054 --> 40:56.855
Joe.

40:56.888 --> 41:01.560
One vote does, one vote Joe.

41:01.593 --> 41:02.093
Desi.

41:02.127 --> 41:05.531
That's two votes Desi.

41:05.564 --> 41:06.031
Desi.

41:06.064 --> 41:07.132
Three votes Desi.

41:07.165 --> 41:10.368
One vote Joe.

41:10.401 --> 41:10.936
Desi.

41:10.969 --> 41:15.106
That's four votes Desi.

41:15.140 --> 41:18.510
Eighth person voted out and
first member of our jury, Desi.

41:18.544 --> 41:33.424
That's five, that's enough, you
need to bring me your torch.

41:33.458 --> 41:37.162
Desi, the tribe has spoken.

41:37.195 --> 41:38.864
Good luck, everyone.

41:38.897 --> 41:40.465
Bye, Desi.

41:40.498 --> 41:46.872
Bye, des.

41:46.905 --> 41:49.307
JEFF: Well, if roller
coaster is the theme for the

41:49.340 --> 41:52.611
night, we are still early in the
ride, which means there are

41:52.644 --> 41:55.280
still a lot more loops to come.

41:55.313 --> 41:56.682
Grab your torches, head back to
camp.

41:56.715 --> 41:59.885
Good night.

42:04.422 --> 42:05.156
We go further, so you can.

42:09.761 --> 42:10.762
from our next episode.

42:14.733 --> 42:18.837
JEFF: Next time on
"survivor," Lauren's armed and

42:18.870 --> 42:19.605
dangerous.

42:19.638 --> 42:20.371
I pulled that off really
good.

42:20.405 --> 42:22.908
My psychorat advantage is in
play.

42:22.941 --> 42:25.410
JEFF: While Ryan's loose
lips.

42:25.443 --> 42:30.348
I have an idol in my pants
only me and you know about.

42:30.381 --> 42:32.450
Ryan has an idol.

42:32.483 --> 42:34.820
In the blink of an eye my
game has completely changed.

42:34.853 --> 42:37.689
It didn't go as I had hoped
or planned.

42:37.723 --> 42:39.190
It's truly heartbreaking.

42:39.224 --> 42:40.491
I'm in the used to losing.

42:40.525 --> 42:45.330
It's in the part of what i
typically do, but in this game I

42:45.363 --> 42:48.299
wasn't part of anybody's plan
moving forward, so I have the

42:48.333 --> 42:50.736
realize that's part of the game
and somebody has the go home.

42:50.769 --> 42:50.836
I don't think I have anything
else to say.
