<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.471 --> 00:07.007
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.075 --> 00:09.443
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.511 --> 00:12.098
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.166 --> 00:14.471
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.539 --> 00:16.503
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.571 --> 00:19.741
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:19.809 --> 00:22.377
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.445 --> 00:23.977
<i>A trigger-happy</i>
<i>ex-girlfriend...</i>

00:24.044 --> 00:25.612
Should we shoot them?

00:25.679 --> 00:28.179
<i>...An old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:28.247 --> 00:30.582
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.650 --> 00:33.125
<i>...Family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:33.192 --> 00:35.297
<i>...If you're desperate.</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:35.364 --> 00:37.801
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:37.869 --> 00:39.472
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

<i>Low-tech explosives</i>
<i>may be clumsy and unreliable,</i>

00:51.123 --> 00:55.059
<i>but their simplicity makes them</i>
<i>almost impossible to trace.</i>

00:55.126 --> 00:57.661
<i>Sophisticated bombs, on the</i>
<i>other hand, are more effective</i>

00:57.729 --> 01:01.498
<i>but require expertise</i>
<i>and specialized components,</i>

01:01.566 --> 01:03.033
<i>which means</i>
<i>the more lethal the bomb,</i>

01:03.101 --> 01:05.668
<i>the more you know about the man</i>
<i>who wants you dead.</i>

01:07.338 --> 01:08.504
Any progress?

01:08.572 --> 01:11.206
All I know for sure
is this guy is a master.

01:11.274 --> 01:14.077
A detonator wired
to a depth finder.

01:14.145 --> 01:16.248
I'm a little jealous
I didn't think of it myself.

01:16.316 --> 01:18.985
Jesse's contact did
a chemical analysis of the C-4.

01:19.052 --> 01:21.856
It was stolen from a batch
in the Soviet Union.

01:23.593 --> 01:25.027
In 1988.

01:25.095 --> 01:27.130
A dead end.

01:27.198 --> 01:28.632
So, what now?

01:28.700 --> 01:32.135
Try accessing the U.S.
counterterrorist databases,

01:32.203 --> 01:33.537
see if I can find
something.

01:33.605 --> 01:35.573
Michael, you get caught breaking
into Homeland Security,

01:35.641 --> 01:37.343
this bomb will be the least
of your worries.

01:37.411 --> 01:39.145
If I don't find out
who framed me,

01:39.213 --> 01:41.615
I'm gonna spend my golden years
in Guantanamo.

01:41.683 --> 01:44.019
I could call someone I used to
know. He might be able to help.

01:44.087 --> 01:45.621
- Do I know him?
- No.

01:45.689 --> 01:47.056
But if you need
this kind of information,

01:47.124 --> 01:48.359
he's the person to call.

01:50.663 --> 01:52.063
What, is there bad blood
between you?

01:52.131 --> 01:53.332
He likes me fine.

01:53.400 --> 01:54.901
I'm less enthusiastic
about him.

01:54.969 --> 01:56.470
But under the circumstances,

01:56.538 --> 01:58.372
I think he might be
our best option.

02:00.842 --> 02:02.909
I'll, uh, I'll send him
the photos

02:02.977 --> 02:05.645
and see if he comes back
with anything.

02:05.713 --> 02:07.114
In the meantime...

02:07.181 --> 02:09.416
Why don't you go over
your old leads?

02:09.484 --> 02:11.418
Maybe you missed
something.

02:12.954 --> 02:15.022
But don't forget we've got lunch
with your mom tomorrow.

02:19.093 --> 02:20.427
Michael,
I'm talking to you.

02:20.494 --> 02:22.195
Yeah. Ma. What?

02:22.263 --> 02:24.564
I was just saying that
you better be in a good mood

02:24.632 --> 02:26.099
for this boat ride.

02:26.167 --> 02:27.500
You've been preoccupied
all week.

02:27.568 --> 02:30.136
We're going on a boat ride
with this guy?

02:30.204 --> 02:31.237
I thought
it was just lunch.

02:31.305 --> 02:32.906
"This guy's" name is Ben.

02:32.974 --> 02:34.408
And it's not just any boat.

02:34.476 --> 02:35.976
It's the new glass-bottom boat

02:36.044 --> 02:37.579
that that they're running
out of Coconut Grove.

02:39.181 --> 02:40.715
Go easy on him,
Madeline.

02:40.783 --> 02:42.050
He still doesn't know
that some couples

02:42.117 --> 02:44.653
do things besides fight
multinational conspiracies.

02:44.721 --> 02:46.888
You know, you could learn
a thing or two from Ben. Hmm.

02:46.956 --> 02:49.724
Like taking Fiona here out
more often.

02:49.792 --> 02:51.693
A woman needs to be appreciated,
Michael.

02:51.761 --> 02:54.195
Thank you, Madeline.

02:54.263 --> 02:55.797
Do you have anything
to say to that?

02:58.200 --> 02:59.734
I think we have a problem.

02:59.802 --> 03:01.335
This looks like a trap.

03:01.403 --> 03:02.703
Who the hell
are these people?

03:02.771 --> 03:04.237
I don't know.
Jesus.

03:04.305 --> 03:06.573
Fi, you take the two behind.
I'll hit the guys in front.

03:06.640 --> 03:08.307
On three.
One, two...

03:08.375 --> 03:09.709
Put the gun down.

03:09.776 --> 03:12.177
I know what this is.
You know what <i>what</i> is?

03:12.245 --> 03:14.379
You know the contact that I reached
out to, the one that I told you about?

03:14.447 --> 03:16.015
This is just his style.

03:16.082 --> 03:17.950
Fi, you don't
have to do this.

03:18.018 --> 03:19.418
It's a little late for that.

03:38.871 --> 03:40.805
Fiona, it's so good
to see you.

03:40.872 --> 03:42.540
I was just finishing up
some business in Rio

03:42.608 --> 03:44.175
when you called.

03:44.243 --> 03:46.410
My pilot flew us here
as fast as he could.

03:46.478 --> 03:48.679
Did you really have to send a fleet
of motorcycles to pick me up?

03:48.747 --> 03:50.614
I didn't have to.
I <i>wanted</i> to.

03:50.682 --> 03:53.784
So, can you tell me
who built the bomb or not?

03:53.852 --> 03:55.919
Of course I can.
You know me --

03:55.987 --> 03:57.120
always a friend
to those in need.

04:00.190 --> 04:01.357
What's your price,
Armand?

04:01.425 --> 04:03.058
No price.
My help is free.

04:03.126 --> 04:05.193
All I ask is...
one small favor.

04:07.730 --> 04:09.164
These are
of Riker Munitions.

04:09.231 --> 04:11.032
It's a weapons company
out in Doral.

04:11.100 --> 04:12.534
You see that truck
in the yard?

04:12.602 --> 04:15.404
On Thursday, it will be loaded
with armor-piercing rounds.

04:15.471 --> 04:16.838
I was hoping
you could get it for me.

04:16.906 --> 04:18.473
You mean
<i>steal</i> it for you.

04:18.541 --> 04:19.774
I suppose you could
call it that, yes.

04:19.841 --> 04:22.611
Well, I count four guards
at the front gate alone.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.246
Am I supposed to
just shoot all of them?

04:24.314 --> 04:25.681
I'll leave the details
up to you.

04:25.748 --> 04:28.116
But if you want me to find out
who built your bomb,

04:28.184 --> 04:29.918
I'll need you
to get me this.

04:29.985 --> 04:32.820
You can give me your answer,
say, tomorrow?

04:40.593 --> 04:41.959
I'll wait for your call.

04:41.984 --> 04:45.984

04:53.413 --> 04:54.914
Are you nuts?

04:54.981 --> 04:57.750
We're talking about robbing
a weapons manufacturer.

04:57.818 --> 04:59.786
I mean, I expect crazy talk
out of her, but you?

04:59.854 --> 05:01.921
I don't like it, either,
but we've hit a dead end

05:01.989 --> 05:03.457
finding who built
this bomb.

05:03.524 --> 05:04.792
Time's running out, Sam.

05:04.860 --> 05:06.994
Well, can't you do some
other favor for the guy,

05:07.062 --> 05:08.930
like mow his lawn
or wash his plane?

05:08.998 --> 05:10.865
That's not
how Armand works.

05:10.933 --> 05:12.700
If we want his help,
we have to do as he asks.

05:12.768 --> 05:14.602
That's funny. I heard
the devil works the same way.

05:14.670 --> 05:16.070
I'd do it myself, but --

05:16.138 --> 05:18.239
But Michael's new friend,
Agent Pearce,

05:18.307 --> 05:20.408
has a top-secret mission
for him.

05:20.476 --> 05:21.275
- Another one?
- Yes.

05:21.343 --> 05:22.844
I'm just saying,

05:22.912 --> 05:24.913
the way the CIA is working you
on these hush-hush gigs

05:24.981 --> 05:26.948
reminds me of another group
of spies you used to work for.

05:27.016 --> 05:29.318
You can say no.
I'd understand.

05:29.385 --> 05:31.353
I'll do it, Mike,
but you're gonna buy me

05:31.421 --> 05:33.622
every mojito I can drink for a month.
Deal.

05:33.636 --> 05:34.895
Okay, good, 'cause someone's
got to keep

05:34.920 --> 05:36.386
Tinker Bell here
from shooting everyone.

05:36.593 --> 05:37.359
Thank you.

05:38.128 --> 05:39.361
Both of you.

05:40.430 --> 05:42.598
Give my regards
to Agent Pearce.

05:49.105 --> 05:51.573
Good to see you again, Michael.

05:51.641 --> 05:53.809
Agent Pearce, you look like
you could use a nap.

05:53.876 --> 05:55.043
Mm.

05:57.947 --> 05:59.348
Got in on the red-eye from Cairo
this morning.

05:59.416 --> 06:00.949
My clock's still
catching up.

06:01.017 --> 06:02.618
How's our investigation
coming?

06:02.685 --> 06:04.386
Cairo was a bust.

06:04.454 --> 06:06.955
Everyone Max knew there is
either dead or out of the game.

06:07.023 --> 06:08.256
So, where does that
leave us?

06:08.324 --> 06:09.524
Square one.

06:09.592 --> 06:11.926
I'm done kicking over rocks
hoping to get lucky.

06:11.994 --> 06:14.129
The murderer
was here in Miami.

06:14.196 --> 06:16.464
That's where we're going to
refocus the investigation,

06:16.532 --> 06:19.668
as soon as we're done
with <i>this.</i>

06:22.571 --> 06:25.139
Our new CIA assignment.

06:25.207 --> 06:27.274
Steve Cahill -- lowlife
who works as a go-between

06:27.342 --> 06:28.608
for bad guys
around the globe.

06:28.676 --> 06:29.943
We want him.

06:30.011 --> 06:32.512
You "Want him," as in
you want to extract him. Why?

06:32.579 --> 06:35.582
Anywhere Cahill goes,
nastiness usually follows.

06:35.649 --> 06:37.451
If he's up to something,
we'd like to know what it is.

06:37.518 --> 06:38.819
Where do we find him?

06:38.886 --> 06:40.587
One of our agents heard him
running his mouth

06:40.655 --> 06:42.122
in a Bangkok bar
about some big powwow

06:42.189 --> 06:43.589
he's got
in the Caribbean tomorrow.

06:43.657 --> 06:45.224
Our orders are to find out
who he's meeting,

06:45.292 --> 06:46.792
record what it's about.

06:46.860 --> 06:49.128
And we put a head bag
on Cahill.

06:49.196 --> 06:50.997
- How big's our team?
- You're looking at it.

06:51.064 --> 06:53.600
The brass wants to keep this
on the way-down-low.

06:53.667 --> 06:55.369
Agent Pearce,
a snatch-and-grab like this

06:55.436 --> 06:57.338
takes at least
three members --

06:57.405 --> 06:59.240
two for the target
and one for the getaway.

06:59.308 --> 07:02.376
My bosses are willing to let me
bring someone else in.

07:02.444 --> 07:03.812
The only catch

07:03.879 --> 07:06.181
is that they'd have to have
a security clearance.

07:06.249 --> 07:07.616
Wait.

07:07.684 --> 07:09.452
You know somebody with
a security clearance, don't you?

07:09.519 --> 07:12.188
Yeah, but he's not
gonna like this.

07:12.255 --> 07:14.457
I hope you appreciate this is my
first day off since Christmas.

07:14.525 --> 07:16.959
It's an in-and-out job
in the Caribbean.

07:17.026 --> 07:18.293
Practically a vacation.

07:18.361 --> 07:19.795
Spoken like a man
who's never taken a vacation.

07:19.862 --> 07:21.029
Thanks for the ride, Fi.

07:21.097 --> 07:22.164
Yeah.
Try not to get shot.

07:23.566 --> 07:26.800
Fi, I'm sorry I can't help you
with, uh, the other thing.

07:26.868 --> 07:29.936
It's fine. Sam and I
will figure something out.

07:30.004 --> 07:32.539
I know you don't like Armand,
so it means a lot to me.

07:32.607 --> 07:34.208
I said it's fine.

07:35.543 --> 07:37.645
Michael,
who is that?

07:38.914 --> 07:40.148
That's Agent Pearce.

07:40.215 --> 07:41.783
I think you might have
left out a few details

07:41.851 --> 07:43.084
when you described her.

07:43.152 --> 07:46.255
You must be Fiona.
I read your file.

07:46.323 --> 07:47.690
As an employee
of the U.S. government,

07:47.758 --> 07:50.928
I'm probably not supposed to
say this, but...Wow.

07:50.995 --> 07:55.132
Thanks. Michael told me
almost everything about you.

07:55.199 --> 07:57.134
Oh? Well, I hope
he was discreet.

07:57.202 --> 07:58.635
When it comes
to his work,

07:58.703 --> 08:00.870
Michael takes discretion
to a whole new level.

08:00.938 --> 08:02.105
Oh, that's just
how we're trained.

08:02.173 --> 08:04.307
It used to bug the hell
out of my fiancé.

08:04.375 --> 08:06.877
Your fiancé?
How does he put up with it now?

08:06.945 --> 08:08.546
I could use some tips.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.414
- Her fiancé is, uh --
- Dead.

08:11.917 --> 08:13.351
Eight years now.

08:13.419 --> 08:14.319
I-I'm sorry.

08:14.386 --> 08:15.553
That's okay.

08:15.621 --> 08:17.655
Michael, we should go.

08:17.723 --> 08:19.358
Thanks for letting me
borrow him for a few days.

08:19.425 --> 08:20.793
You're welcome.

08:20.860 --> 08:22.361
I'll take good care
of him.

08:28.302 --> 08:30.003
<i>There's a reason that everyone</i>

08:30.071 --> 08:33.306
<i>from 17th-century pirates</i>
<i>to present-day drug smugglers</i>

08:33.374 --> 08:35.107
<i>have operated in the Caribbean.</i>

08:38.010 --> 08:41.113
<i>It's filled with tiny islands</i>
<i>that are close to major ports</i>

08:41.181 --> 08:43.582
<i>but outside the reach</i>
<i>of national laws.</i>

08:43.650 --> 08:45.217
<i>That said, the privacy</i>

08:45.285 --> 08:47.152
<i>that makes the islands</i>
<i>great hiding places</i>

08:47.219 --> 08:48.820
<i>also makes them vulnerable.</i>

08:48.887 --> 08:51.255
<i>Your enemies may be able</i>
<i>to hide from you,</i>

08:51.323 --> 08:54.191
<i>but you can hide from them</i>
<i>just as easily.</i>

09:01.833 --> 09:03.667
- Another coffee while you wait?
- No.

09:06.170 --> 09:08.906
I've been waiting for two hours.
Where's your boss?

09:08.974 --> 09:10.274
This is unacceptable.

09:10.341 --> 09:11.741
Sir, he'll be with you
in just a moment.

09:11.809 --> 09:12.742
He's cranky.

09:15.746 --> 09:17.713
Jesse.

09:17.781 --> 09:20.516
Looks like Cahill's mystery date
has finally arrived.

09:20.584 --> 09:23.385
Well, look who it is.
That's Miles Vanderwall.

09:23.453 --> 09:25.020
And who is he, exactly?

09:25.088 --> 09:26.555
A high-ranking mercenary

09:26.622 --> 09:28.857
with a group called
Optimal Outcomes.

09:28.924 --> 09:31.326
He's torched more than his fair
share of villages to the ground.

09:31.393 --> 09:32.560
He sounds like
a sweetheart.

09:32.628 --> 09:34.229
He's as sadistic
as they come.

09:39.036 --> 09:41.204
I wonder what they could have
to chat about.

09:41.272 --> 09:42.872
Well, let's find out.

09:42.940 --> 09:45.209
Any particular reason
you're three hours late?

09:45.276 --> 09:46.944
I am a professional.

09:47.012 --> 09:49.079
Sorry, mate.
Do I work for you?

10:00.926 --> 10:03.627
Give the rodent
his money.

10:05.997 --> 10:07.997
Can I at least get a ride
back to my boat?

10:08.065 --> 10:10.099
You can get out
of my sight.

10:14.371 --> 10:15.738
That wasn't much
of a meeting.

10:15.806 --> 10:17.574
That looked a lot like
a delivery.

10:17.641 --> 10:18.775
Either way,
our interrogators

10:18.843 --> 10:20.978
will be asking Mr. Cahill
all about it.

10:21.046 --> 10:23.414
He's heading west.
We'll grab him on the trail.

10:23.482 --> 10:25.650
I'll get the boat ready.
See you guys at the beach.

10:31.891 --> 10:34.058
<i>Properly scouting</i>
<i>a facility's security</i>

10:34.126 --> 10:35.726
<i>is a two-step process.</i>

10:35.794 --> 10:37.361
<i>Observing the outside</i>

10:37.428 --> 10:39.196
<i>will tell you</i>
<i>about its physical defenses,</i>

10:39.263 --> 10:40.697
<i>but to get a complete picture</i>

10:40.765 --> 10:42.899
<i>of your target's manpower</i>
<i>and security protocols,</i>

10:42.967 --> 10:45.769
<i>you need to get inside</i>
<i>their walls, too.</i>

10:45.837 --> 10:47.037
I hope
you enjoyed the tour.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.206
I think you'll agree our
facilities are topnotch.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.374
No arguments here,
but, uh, we need to talk

10:51.442 --> 10:53.910
about the elephant
in the room -- your security.

10:53.977 --> 10:55.745
Our security is excellent.

10:55.812 --> 10:57.680
Care to be more specific?

10:57.748 --> 10:59.883
I need to know about
intrusion-detection systems,

10:59.950 --> 11:02.186
security-response procedures,
the whole nine.

11:02.253 --> 11:03.620
I'm not allowed
to discuss that.

11:04.522 --> 11:07.290
Do I look like some doe-eyed
twerp with a shiny new MBA?

11:07.358 --> 11:08.991
Let's just cut the crap.

11:09.059 --> 11:11.294
Now, my clients
are very security-conscious

11:11.361 --> 11:13.429
and very unforgiving
of lapses.

11:13.497 --> 11:15.165
- I understand that, but --
- No, I don't think you do,

11:15.232 --> 11:16.566
because I can't advise them

11:16.634 --> 11:18.602
to hand you
a $5-million contract

11:18.670 --> 11:20.437
until I know that
their intellectual property

11:20.505 --> 11:22.039
is gonna be safe
on your assembly lines.

11:23.742 --> 11:26.978
There are other fish
in the sea.

11:27.046 --> 11:28.780
Okay, fine.

11:30.183 --> 11:32.317
You can talk to our
security team. Will that do?

11:32.385 --> 11:34.118
That would be perfect.

11:34.186 --> 11:35.353
Thank you.

11:41.726 --> 11:42.960
That bad, huh?

11:43.027 --> 11:44.728
Yeah. It's that bad.

11:44.795 --> 11:46.729
An alarm goes off
anywhere in the complex,

11:46.797 --> 11:49.198
and guards come swarming in
in like 30 seconds.

11:49.266 --> 11:50.899
- How many guards?
- I don't know.

11:50.967 --> 11:52.565
10, a Baker's dozen.
What difference does it make?

11:52.590 --> 11:53.790
Damn it.

11:53.803 --> 11:55.003
Look, if Armand
is just looking

11:55.071 --> 11:56.605
for a couple of crates
of armor-piercing rounds,

11:56.673 --> 11:58.073
why don't we just get them
someplace else?

11:58.141 --> 11:59.375
It doesn't work that way.

11:59.443 --> 12:01.177
If he wants that truck,
we give it to him.

12:01.244 --> 12:03.512
What the hell does he care
what truck it is?

12:03.580 --> 12:04.613
I'm sure
he has his reasons.

12:05.949 --> 12:07.716
All right, well, unless
we can do something clever

12:07.784 --> 12:10.852
to get past those guards, it's
gonna get real ugly real fast.

12:10.920 --> 12:12.687
Well, then, we'll have to think
of something clever, Sam.

12:16.124 --> 12:17.558
<i>Spies have long known</i>

12:17.626 --> 12:19.659
<i>it's a good idea to bring along</i>
<i>a fast-acting drug</i>

12:19.727 --> 12:21.761
<i>when you're targeting someone</i>
<i>for extraction.</i>

12:21.829 --> 12:23.730
<i>In the earliest days</i>
<i>of espionage,</i>

12:23.798 --> 12:26.232
<i>that meant a rag soaked</i>
<i>in chloroform or ether,</i>

12:26.300 --> 12:28.835
<i>but now it's usually</i>
<i>a syringe of propofol.</i>

12:28.902 --> 12:31.270
<i>It works quicker</i>
<i>and has fewer side effects</i>

12:31.338 --> 12:33.706
<i>but shares one downside</i>
<i>with its predecessors --</i>

12:33.774 --> 12:35.374
<i>you still have to</i>
<i>get close to your target</i>

12:35.442 --> 12:36.910
<i>to administer the dose.</i>

12:36.977 --> 12:38.712
Who the hell --

12:38.779 --> 12:41.448
<i>that's why it never hurts</i>
<i>to attack from two angles.</i>

12:41.516 --> 12:43.116
Let me go! Help!
Stop fighting.

12:43.184 --> 12:44.551
Help! Help!

12:44.619 --> 12:46.487
It's better
if you stop fighting.

12:46.555 --> 12:48.823
Hey --

12:48.891 --> 12:50.792
You know, I could have
taken him myself easily.

12:54.797 --> 12:55.997
We have a problem.

12:56.065 --> 12:57.465
Remember when I said
Vanderwall works

12:57.533 --> 12:58.866
with a ruthless group
of mercenaries?

12:58.934 --> 13:01.135
Vanderwall
didn't come here alone.

13:01.203 --> 13:03.638
Their last transport boat
just shipped out.

13:10.945 --> 13:13.413
Damn. What the hell
are they up to?

13:13.481 --> 13:15.349
Whatever it is, we're gonna
have to deal with it alone.

13:15.416 --> 13:17.852
There's no way we're getting
past them to our boat now.

13:17.920 --> 13:18.653
Mike, that would mean --

13:18.678 --> 13:20.075
It means we're not
getting off this island.

13:26.038 --> 13:28.555
<i>When you find yourself</i>
<i>in a tough situation,</i>

13:28.556 --> 13:30.547
<i>like being outnumbered 20 to 1</i>

13:30.548 --> 13:32.115
<i>on an island</i>
<i>crawling with mercenaries,</i>

13:32.183 --> 13:33.583
<i>it's important to remember</i>

13:33.651 --> 13:35.452
<i>that the key to any battle</i>
<i>is intelligence.</i>

13:35.519 --> 13:38.287
<i>It may be tempting to shoot</i>
<i>first and ask questions later,</i>

13:38.355 --> 13:42.157
<i>but if you want to stay alive,</i>
<i>you ask questions first.</i>

13:43.426 --> 13:46.128
Rise and shine.

13:46.195 --> 13:47.862
You guys are both dead.

13:47.930 --> 13:49.631
When those mercs
find my boat still here,

13:49.698 --> 13:50.965
they're gonna come looking
for me.

13:51.033 --> 13:52.666
And kill us? What do you
think they'll do to <i>you?</i>

13:52.734 --> 13:54.201
- Try nothing.
- Oh?

13:54.269 --> 13:55.636
Oh, they must have
a lenient policy

13:55.703 --> 13:57.337
when it comes to people
leaking their secrets

13:57.404 --> 13:58.605
to U.S. intelligence
agencies.

13:58.672 --> 14:00.740
What are you talking about?
I didn't leak --

14:00.808 --> 14:02.575
A Bangkok watering hole,

14:02.643 --> 14:04.310
three Mai tais, and
a very expensive call girl.

14:04.378 --> 14:05.445
Ring any bells?

14:05.512 --> 14:07.914
Oh, Christ.

14:07.982 --> 14:10.083
You guys are CIA?

14:10.150 --> 14:12.285
Yes, and if you want
to keep breathing,

14:12.353 --> 14:14.587
I suggest you start
cooperating with us.

14:14.655 --> 14:16.456
Well, I can't do that. You don't
know what they'll do to me.

14:16.524 --> 14:17.858
Whatever it is, Cahill,

14:17.926 --> 14:19.693
it's gonna happen
unless we all get out of this,

14:19.761 --> 14:22.062
so start talking now.

14:23.698 --> 14:25.799
The mercs are about to launch
attacks in South America.

14:25.867 --> 14:27.201
This island's
their operating base.

14:27.268 --> 14:29.236
Some shady oil conglomerate

14:29.303 --> 14:31.605
hired them to wipe out a bunch
of American outposts --

14:31.672 --> 14:33.306
D.E.A. secret bases,
CIA safe houses.

14:33.374 --> 14:35.075
And when they're gone,
the conglomerate

14:35.143 --> 14:37.077
takes over the local wells,
and no one makes a fuss.

14:37.145 --> 14:38.145
So you know their playbook.

14:38.213 --> 14:39.947
The files
on all the outposts --

14:40.014 --> 14:41.348
that's what I delivered
to Vanderwall.

14:41.415 --> 14:42.482
Which outposts
were they?

14:42.550 --> 14:43.616
W-well,
I didn't memorize them.

14:43.684 --> 14:44.951
They're all over
the continent.

14:45.019 --> 14:45.852
Where'd you get
the files?

14:45.920 --> 14:47.287
Some guy from the NSA.

14:47.354 --> 14:48.888
The NSA has a leak?
I want a name.

14:48.956 --> 14:50.223
I don't know it!
He used a cut-out!

14:50.290 --> 14:51.424
We didn't become
Facebook buddies!

14:52.926 --> 14:54.359
Forget about getting off
this island.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.227
Without those files, we don't
know who the NSA leak is

14:56.295 --> 14:57.829
or which outposts
the mercs are targeting.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.497
A lot of our people get killed
if we don't get them back.

14:59.565 --> 15:00.565
Let's get them back.

15:05.304 --> 15:07.672
All right, I took
a scenic tour of the island.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.941
The base is here,
airstrip's right here,

15:10.009 --> 15:11.543
satellite uplink
is way over here,

15:11.611 --> 15:13.145
and the hard asses
with the M4s,

15:13.212 --> 15:15.347
they're kind of...
Everywhere.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.449
We could try to get to
the uplink and call for help.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.150
There wouldn't be enough
time for help to get here.

15:19.218 --> 15:21.553
As soon as the mercs find that
Cahill's boat is still here,

15:21.620 --> 15:22.687
they'll know
something's up.

15:22.755 --> 15:23.855
What do you
suggest we do --

15:23.923 --> 15:25.123
take on 50 guys
with our handguns?

15:25.190 --> 15:26.924
Well,
if we can't beat them...

15:26.992 --> 15:28.326
I say we join them.

15:28.393 --> 15:30.361
What's that
supposed to mean?

15:30.429 --> 15:32.430
We need a reason to explain
our presence on the island.

15:32.497 --> 15:34.431
I say we go in,
say we're a covert security team

15:34.499 --> 15:35.966
from the company
that hired them.

15:36.034 --> 15:38.368
I like it.
I like it very much.

15:38.436 --> 15:40.237
We say we, uh, we caught Cahill
betraying them.

15:40.305 --> 15:41.538
We saved the day.

15:41.606 --> 15:42.807
Jesus,
you're not kidding.

15:42.874 --> 15:44.142
Uh, w-what about when
they check us out?

15:44.209 --> 15:45.944
We got to make sure
that doesn't happen.

15:46.011 --> 15:47.646
We'll go to their comlink,
take it out,

15:47.713 --> 15:49.114
make sure
they can't call out.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.016
That is, bar none,
the craziest play

15:51.084 --> 15:52.285
I have ever heard
in the field.

15:52.352 --> 15:53.853
Well, you don't hang out
with him enough.

15:59.460 --> 16:01.828
Looks like
the coast is clear.

16:01.895 --> 16:04.463
No C-4, no thermite,
no det cord.

16:04.531 --> 16:05.831
Hell, we don't even have
gasoline.

16:05.899 --> 16:07.699
Yeah, you work with Mike,
you get used to doing

16:07.767 --> 16:09.234
without the perks
of government work --

16:09.302 --> 16:11.102
you know, things like equipment.

16:11.170 --> 16:13.604
You ever miss it,
working for the government?

16:13.672 --> 16:15.472
I don't know.
Sometimes, I guess.

16:15.540 --> 16:18.041
I made calls about you.
Mm-hmm.

16:18.109 --> 16:20.277
You were CIFA's wonder boy
until...

16:20.344 --> 16:21.645
Michael Westen
came into my life.

16:21.713 --> 16:23.681
So, what's the deal?

16:23.748 --> 16:25.982
Why work with the man
who ruined your career?

16:26.050 --> 16:26.850
Free yogurt.

16:27.719 --> 16:28.886
Lots of free yogurt.

16:28.953 --> 16:30.354
Yeah, that's cute.
You like that?

16:30.422 --> 16:31.422
It's really good.

16:35.761 --> 16:37.762
All right.
Let's burn it.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.831
<i>Destroying</i>
<i>high-tech electronics</i>

16:39.899 --> 16:41.534
<i>with glorified</i>
<i>camping equipment</i>

16:41.601 --> 16:43.368
<i>is tough but not impossible.</i>

16:43.436 --> 16:46.471
<i>The mix of nitrate and</i>
<i>magnesium in a marine flare</i>

16:46.539 --> 16:49.474
<i>burns at over 3,000 degrees.</i>

16:56.080 --> 16:59.049
<i>With the right fuse,</i>
<i>it'll turn an electrical system</i>

16:59.116 --> 17:01.784
<i>into a smoldering heap.</i>

17:06.390 --> 17:08.691
Hey, for what it's worth,

17:08.759 --> 17:10.646
sorry we dragged you out
away from home for all this.

17:10.646 --> 17:11.122
Oh, no worries.

17:11.127 --> 17:12.328
If it makes you feel
any better,

17:12.396 --> 17:14.763
things usually aren't
much easier back in Miami.

17:18.836 --> 17:20.435
<i>To hit a facility directly,</i>

17:20.503 --> 17:22.672
<i>you just need a gun</i>
<i>and the willingness to use it.</i>

17:22.740 --> 17:24.540
<i>Less-bloody approaches</i>
<i>require fewer bullets</i>

17:24.608 --> 17:26.474
<i>but more planning...</i>

17:26.542 --> 17:27.476
<i>And more recruiting.</i>

17:27.544 --> 17:29.545
You want me to do <i>what?!</i>

17:29.613 --> 17:32.214
All you got to do is tell them
that your car broke down,

17:32.281 --> 17:33.749
ask to use the john,

17:33.816 --> 17:35.283
toss the doodad in the trash,
and split.

17:35.351 --> 17:36.885
Easy peasy, no big deal.

17:36.953 --> 17:40.388
No big deal? You're asking me
to plant a bomb, Sam!

17:40.456 --> 17:41.857
It's a smoke bomb,

17:41.924 --> 17:43.759
timed to go off
after everybody leaves.

17:43.826 --> 17:45.594
Nobody gets hurt...

17:45.662 --> 17:47.197
You know, except us
if you say no.

17:47.264 --> 17:50.367
Who's this guy who wants you
to rob a-a-a weapons company?

17:50.434 --> 17:52.035
Don't bother.
Fi hasn't been too forthcoming

17:52.103 --> 17:53.670
about this Armand guy.

17:53.738 --> 17:55.539
You want me to get
anywhere near this,

17:55.606 --> 17:56.673
you better start talking,
honey.

17:59.210 --> 18:02.046
Armand got me out of Ireland
when nobody else could --

18:02.113 --> 18:04.014
passport, visa, cash.

18:04.081 --> 18:05.816
But his help wasn't free.

18:05.884 --> 18:07.550
What does that mean --
"Wasn't free"?

18:07.618 --> 18:09.553
Well, my price
for my ticket to the U.S.

18:09.621 --> 18:13.056
was lookout duty
on a job in Belfast.

18:13.124 --> 18:14.925
Turns out that job
was a kidnapping.

18:14.993 --> 18:17.894
Okay. Who was kidnapped?
Jesus.

18:17.962 --> 18:19.696
Not an angel...

18:19.764 --> 18:21.364
But nobody who'd done
any harm to me.

18:21.432 --> 18:23.300
I-I didn't know
until after.

18:25.036 --> 18:27.972
Armand kept his word.
He always does.

18:28.039 --> 18:30.474
Look, the point is, if we're gonna find
out who framed Mike for murder,

18:30.542 --> 18:32.176
we got to heist that place,
Maddy.

18:32.244 --> 18:34.211
And we'd like to do it
without killing anyone,

18:34.279 --> 18:35.746
so...

18:35.814 --> 18:37.781
So, fine.

18:39.651 --> 18:40.918
I'll do it.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.465
So, this is home, then?

18:52.532 --> 18:54.366
After all the effort you put
into getting to Miami,

18:54.434 --> 18:56.970
I expected something...
More.

18:57.037 --> 18:59.239
What are you doing here,
Armand?

18:59.306 --> 19:00.740
Is that any way
to greet a guest,

19:00.808 --> 19:02.742
one who comes bearing gifts,
no less?

19:04.211 --> 19:09.816
These automatic rifles
aren't even on the market yet.

19:09.884 --> 19:12.651
You'll recall that working
with me has its perks.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.621
I don't want
heavy artillery.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.790
I'm trying to do this job
without guns.

19:18.858 --> 19:19.958
Without guns?

19:20.026 --> 19:21.893
What has Miami
done to you?

19:21.961 --> 19:23.996
As long as it gets done.

19:24.063 --> 19:26.531
You should keep those
just in case.

19:26.599 --> 19:29.201
By the way, I've been
looking into your...

19:29.269 --> 19:30.369
Bomb maker.

19:30.437 --> 19:31.404
And?

19:31.471 --> 19:33.306
It's fascinating stuff.

19:33.374 --> 19:35.942
I'd love to tell you more,
but a deal's a deal.

19:36.010 --> 19:37.945
Let me know
if you need anything.

19:38.012 --> 19:40.648
If you want to help, I need
a few pounds of metallic sodium.

19:40.716 --> 19:42.350
Intriguing.

19:42.417 --> 19:43.984
You girls
and your secrets.

19:44.052 --> 19:46.120
Fine.

19:46.188 --> 19:48.722
You'll have it
by this evening.

19:48.790 --> 19:50.157
Speaking of help...

19:50.225 --> 19:51.759
Where is this boyfriend
of yours

19:51.827 --> 19:53.427
you went through
so much effort for?

19:53.495 --> 19:55.096
He's busy.

19:55.164 --> 19:56.731
Hmm.

19:56.799 --> 19:59.568
Well,
I hope he's worth it.

20:07.912 --> 20:09.379
How'd it go?

20:09.447 --> 20:11.649
The uplink's toast, but
the mercs found Cahill's boat.

20:11.716 --> 20:12.951
We got to move.
You ready?

20:13.018 --> 20:14.386
I got what Cahill knew
about the company

20:14.454 --> 20:15.654
that's paying for all this.

20:15.722 --> 20:17.155
It's called
the Pyramid Group.

20:17.223 --> 20:18.957
They got offices
in Dubai, Vancouver.

20:19.025 --> 20:20.760
He knew a few names,
but that's it.

20:20.827 --> 20:23.161
This is nuts!
You'll get us killed!

20:23.229 --> 20:24.429
You want to see
tomorrow's sunrise?

20:25.531 --> 20:27.699
You just nod and back up
everything I say.

20:27.767 --> 20:29.067
Can you nod?

20:29.135 --> 20:30.235
Good.

20:30.303 --> 20:32.070
Showtime?
Showtime.

20:33.672 --> 20:35.339
<i>Getting stuck</i>
<i>behind enemy lines</i>

20:35.407 --> 20:36.940
<i>is one of the hazards</i>
<i>of being a spy.</i>

20:37.008 --> 20:38.442
<i>When it happens, you can either</i>

20:38.509 --> 20:40.443
<i>hide in the shadows</i>
<i>and wait to get killed</i>

20:40.511 --> 20:43.780
<i>or you can march into the open</i>
<i>and take your enemy head-on.</i>

20:43.848 --> 20:45.949
<i>It's a game</i>
<i>of high risk, high reward.</i>

20:46.017 --> 20:49.086
<i>Play it right,</i>
<i>and you might survive.</i>

20:49.154 --> 20:50.555
Halt!
Identify yourself now.

20:50.622 --> 20:52.257
Get that weapon
out of my face.

20:52.324 --> 20:54.359
Where's the idiot who's
in charge of this fiasco?

20:55.695 --> 20:57.129
He asked you a question,
soldier.

20:57.197 --> 20:58.597
This guy's brain-dead.

20:58.665 --> 20:59.932
Hey! Jughead!

21:00.000 --> 21:02.535
Which one of you
is Miles Vanderwall?

21:02.602 --> 21:04.803
Miles Vanderwall!
I need to speak to --

21:04.871 --> 21:06.805
you're looking for Vanderwall?
You found him.

21:06.873 --> 21:08.273
You got a death wish, mate.

21:08.341 --> 21:11.710
My men are under orders
to shoot intruders on sight

21:11.778 --> 21:13.044
when they remember them.

21:13.979 --> 21:15.980
Now, then, who are you?

21:16.048 --> 21:18.616
We work internal security
for the Pyramid Group.

21:18.684 --> 21:20.851
What is this,
a security check?

21:20.919 --> 21:22.152
Commander Jackson
didn't tell me --

21:22.220 --> 21:23.620
it wouldn't be much
of a security check

21:23.688 --> 21:25.255
if he told you about it!

21:25.323 --> 21:26.757
Jackson would never
clear that.

21:26.825 --> 21:28.059
We write the checks.

21:28.126 --> 21:29.460
Jackson clears what
we tell him to clear.

21:29.528 --> 21:31.729
I'm calling Jackson.

21:31.797 --> 21:33.898
Oops!

21:33.966 --> 21:35.100
No signal?

21:35.167 --> 21:37.101
You want to know why?

21:38.337 --> 21:39.537
That's why.

21:39.605 --> 21:40.905
Caught this little weasel
scurrying away

21:40.973 --> 21:42.240
from your satellite uplink
after he torched it.

21:42.308 --> 21:43.775
Isn't that right,
little weasel?

21:43.843 --> 21:45.910
Cahill, you bast--
you stand down!

21:47.712 --> 21:49.746
No one touches that man
until I get some answers!

21:49.814 --> 21:53.116
You don't give
the orders here.

21:53.184 --> 21:55.285
How do I even know
any of this is true?

21:55.353 --> 21:56.854
Oh, you think we're lying,
smart guy?

21:56.921 --> 21:59.590
You think we're intruders
who just landed on this island

21:59.657 --> 22:00.991
with heavily armed troops...

22:01.058 --> 22:02.325
We walked right up to you

22:02.393 --> 22:04.561
just to tell you
you have a broken comlink?

22:04.628 --> 22:07.130
If your orders are to shoot us,
then shoot.

22:07.198 --> 22:08.832
Otherwise,
put the weapon down

22:08.899 --> 22:10.400
and help us
secure the island.

22:21.247 --> 22:23.776
<i>When you're pretending to be</i>
<i>on the same side as your enemy</i>

22:23.777 --> 22:25.711
<i>It's critical</i>
<i>to keep them from talking.</i>

22:25.779 --> 22:28.014
<i>The more the bad guys</i>
<i>can compare notes,</i>

22:28.082 --> 22:30.250
<i>the more likely they'll</i>
<i>second-guess your story.</i>

22:30.318 --> 22:31.818
<i>That's why you shut down</i>

22:31.886 --> 22:34.088
<i>as many forms of communication</i>
<i>as you can.</i>

22:34.155 --> 22:36.157
<i>It won't make you any friends,</i>

22:36.225 --> 22:38.326
<i>but friends are a luxury when</i>
<i>you're trying to stay alive.</i>

22:38.394 --> 22:39.928
All right,
listen up, grunts.

22:39.995 --> 22:42.163
Your security stinks.

22:42.231 --> 22:43.931
It stinks worse
than a garbage truck in August.

22:43.999 --> 22:45.566
That is about to change.

22:45.634 --> 22:48.869
Oh. I'm sorry, soldier.
Am I boring you?

22:48.937 --> 22:50.337
I guess you know
everything there is to know

22:50.405 --> 22:51.839
about security, huh?

22:51.907 --> 22:53.307
I guess
you didn't just let

22:53.375 --> 22:55.843
your only satellite uplink
get torched to the ground!

22:55.911 --> 22:57.278
Did you?!

22:58.413 --> 23:00.981
About to clean this mess up,
gentlemen, A.S.A.P.

23:01.048 --> 23:02.148
Is that understood?

23:02.216 --> 23:03.616
Yes, sir.

23:03.684 --> 23:04.984
- I said, "Is that understood?"
- Yes, sir!

23:05.052 --> 23:06.686
That's more like it.

23:06.754 --> 23:09.188
Now, until we find out whether or not
Mr. Cahill was working alone,

23:09.256 --> 23:11.057
we will assume that our radios
have been compromised.

23:11.124 --> 23:12.258
Is that clear?

23:12.325 --> 23:13.859
- Yes, sir!
- Okay.

23:13.927 --> 23:15.627
Until further notice...

23:15.695 --> 23:17.329
You will surrender your radios
to me.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.431
Let's go.
Give them up.

23:20.867 --> 23:22.734
Oh, he's really
pushing it.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.303
He knows what he's doing.

23:24.370 --> 23:27.506
I think it's safe to report to
Vanderwall the base is secure.

23:27.574 --> 23:29.475
Time to get him to show us
those files.

23:29.543 --> 23:31.744
And when he does,
any idea how to take them

23:31.812 --> 23:33.446
from an elite squad
of professional killers?

23:33.514 --> 23:34.547
I'll figure something out.

23:42.256 --> 23:46.326
It's not fit for scrap.

23:46.394 --> 23:48.095
I'm gonna make Cahill suffer.

23:48.162 --> 23:50.497
All in good time,
Mr. Vanderwall.

23:50.565 --> 23:52.065
But for now,
we need to make sure

23:52.133 --> 23:54.067
that list he brought you
is secure.

23:54.135 --> 23:55.870
The list
is bloody secure.

23:55.937 --> 23:58.139
Do you have brain damage?

23:58.206 --> 24:00.675
Have you forgotten?
You're a mercenary.

24:00.742 --> 24:03.511
My company has fronted you
$10 million.

24:03.579 --> 24:04.512
It's safe!

24:04.580 --> 24:05.847
And mind your tone.

24:05.915 --> 24:07.048
Safe?

24:07.116 --> 24:09.718
Like that uplink?!

24:09.785 --> 24:11.720
Look how the accelerant
was applied to the conduits.

24:11.787 --> 24:14.322
That's the work of a pro.

24:14.390 --> 24:16.892
We can assume that Cahill's working
with somebody, somebody with skills.

24:16.959 --> 24:19.261
For all we know, a team
of highly trained operatives

24:19.328 --> 24:21.396
could be after those files
right now.

24:21.464 --> 24:23.265
Let them try.

24:23.332 --> 24:26.001
I'm under orders
from commander Jackson

24:26.068 --> 24:29.772
not to show them to anyone
until I launch the operation.

24:29.839 --> 24:31.306
Interesting attitude.

24:31.374 --> 24:33.709
You know, maybe he's not worried
about anyone stealing it

24:33.777 --> 24:35.211
because <i>he's</i> the one
helping Cahill.

24:35.278 --> 24:37.747
Best traitors are the ones
you least suspect.

24:37.815 --> 24:42.018
Call me a traitor again, love,
and I'll end you.

24:42.086 --> 24:44.554
And I'll take my sweet time
doing it.

24:44.622 --> 24:46.256
You don't want
to be called a traitor?

24:46.324 --> 24:48.392
Stop acting like one!

24:48.460 --> 24:51.028
The files
are in a command post

24:51.096 --> 24:53.297
on the other side
of the island.

24:53.366 --> 24:54.699
Come on.

24:54.767 --> 24:57.569
Come see how safe they are
for yourselves.

25:06.612 --> 25:09.279
Looks like he's bringing 40 of his
buddies along for the ride.

25:09.347 --> 25:10.614
I do not like our odds.

25:10.682 --> 25:12.215
Then let's even them out.

25:12.283 --> 25:13.717
Thought exercise.

25:13.784 --> 25:17.153
While you guys are gearing up
for an island hayride,

25:17.221 --> 25:19.189
who's patrolling the bush
for intruders?

25:19.256 --> 25:20.724
Let's go!

25:20.792 --> 25:22.627
We need 15 men in the jungle,
10 more at the north cove.

25:22.694 --> 25:24.128
You ever hear
of a beach infiltration?

25:24.196 --> 25:25.763
Yeah, I didn't think so.
Come on!

25:25.831 --> 25:29.100
Don Juan, you and Romeo grab
some men and sit on Cahill.

25:29.168 --> 25:31.335
Anybody comes to rescue him,
take them out.

25:31.403 --> 25:34.505
I mean right now. Go!

25:34.573 --> 25:37.775
Stay where you are.

25:40.546 --> 25:42.213
I don't care who you are.

25:42.281 --> 25:43.615
This is my island.

25:43.682 --> 25:46.050
Nobody gives my men orders
but me.

25:46.118 --> 25:47.919
Your island
is a security disaster.

25:47.987 --> 25:50.288
Unless you want the boss
to hear all about it,

25:50.356 --> 25:51.890
I suggest
you lock it down.

25:54.293 --> 25:57.829
You heard what they said.
Move!

26:05.370 --> 26:06.971
Well, that's still 5 guys
with machine guns.

26:07.038 --> 26:08.338
Better than 40.

26:13.612 --> 26:15.746
You know, Fi, there's
still time to call this off.

26:15.814 --> 26:17.581
There's no turning back now.

26:17.649 --> 26:19.616
We have to get Armand
that truck.

26:19.684 --> 26:21.918
Like it or not, Sam,
this heist is happening.

26:21.986 --> 26:24.588
<i>The quickest way to turn</i>
<i>a security force's attention</i>

26:24.655 --> 26:26.589
<i>away from an outside attack</i>

26:26.657 --> 26:28.391
<i>is to make them think</i>
<i>there's an even bigger threat</i>

26:28.459 --> 26:29.926
<i>inside their facility.</i>

26:29.993 --> 26:32.762
<i>If you know which employees</i>
<i>will be out of town,</i>

26:32.830 --> 26:35.464
<i>you can send a care package</i>
<i>filled with metallic sodium</i>

26:35.532 --> 26:37.032
<i>to an empty office.</i>

26:37.100 --> 26:38.500
That gizmo Maddy placed
in the bathroom

26:38.568 --> 26:39.568
should have gone off
by now.

26:39.635 --> 26:40.702
Maybe something's wrong.

26:40.769 --> 26:42.237
Your clock is fast.

26:42.304 --> 26:44.106
Nothing's wrong.
I built that gizmo.

26:44.173 --> 26:45.407
<i>Then all you have to do</i>

26:45.475 --> 26:47.276
<i>is set off the company's</i>
<i>sprinkler system</i>

26:47.344 --> 26:48.611
<i>with a smoke bomb.</i>

26:48.679 --> 26:50.080
<i>If you do it right,</i>

26:50.147 --> 26:52.449
<i>the sodium will react</i>
<i>with the water,</i>

26:52.517 --> 26:54.351
<i>and you've got</i>
<i>the distraction you need.</i>

27:00.626 --> 27:02.426
That's our cue.

27:11.003 --> 27:12.670
Easy, big fella.

27:12.738 --> 27:14.739
Toss the gun.
Thank you very kindly.

27:14.807 --> 27:16.474
Now, you stay put,
and we'll be out of your hair

27:16.542 --> 27:18.476
before you can say,
"Life's too short."

27:18.544 --> 27:20.244
How's it going, Fi?

27:20.312 --> 27:22.780
This wiring belongs
in a museum.

27:22.848 --> 27:24.582
So I'm thinking of changing
my deal with Mike.

27:24.650 --> 27:25.783
Can this wait a second?

27:25.851 --> 27:27.218
I'm kind of in the middle
of something.

27:28.520 --> 27:29.854
You were saying?

27:29.922 --> 27:31.456
If we're risking our necks

27:31.524 --> 27:33.825
while Mike is working on his tan
in the tropics,

27:33.892 --> 27:35.593
he's gonna buy me <i>two</i> months'
worth of mojitos.

27:46.938 --> 27:48.305
<i>As a general rule,</i>

27:48.373 --> 27:51.341
<i>spies prefer to steal</i>
<i>information quietly.</i>

27:51.409 --> 27:53.510
<i>It's a lot easier</i>
<i>to pay off an informant,</i>

27:53.578 --> 27:55.612
<i>hack a computer,</i>
<i>or crack a safe</i>

27:55.679 --> 27:57.180
<i>than it is to grab something</i>

27:57.247 --> 27:59.449
<i>from someone who's armed</i>
<i>and angry.</i>

27:59.517 --> 28:03.153
<i>But like any job, some days</i>
<i>are just harder than others.</i>

28:06.857 --> 28:09.091
Oy! What do you think
you're doing here?

28:09.159 --> 28:10.960
This is my island
and my command.

28:11.028 --> 28:12.595
Take it up with
commander Jackson.

28:12.662 --> 28:13.896
He brought us here
himself.

28:13.964 --> 28:16.265
What the hell
is going on?

28:16.333 --> 28:19.268
Looks like Jackson sent his
own team to protect the files.

28:19.336 --> 28:20.203
This is bad.

28:23.774 --> 28:25.708
What did you do
with the files?

28:25.775 --> 28:28.443
Jackson took them --
back to Grand Cayman.

28:28.511 --> 28:31.079
Rubbish. He would have told me
he was coming to the island.

28:31.147 --> 28:32.447
Really? How?

28:32.515 --> 28:35.350
Phones are down, radios silent.
We assumed the worst.

28:35.418 --> 28:36.751
So, what am I
supposed to do

28:36.819 --> 28:39.220
with the security team
from Pyramid?

28:41.524 --> 28:43.090
What did he say

28:43.158 --> 28:45.893
about the team he cleared
to come to the island?

28:45.961 --> 28:49.363
Nothing. He told us to stay here
and wait for orders.

28:49.431 --> 28:50.497
That's it.

28:55.636 --> 28:56.770
So...

28:56.838 --> 28:59.439
Mr. internal security...

28:59.506 --> 29:02.008
If you're here
with Jackson's blessing,

29:02.076 --> 29:05.713
why is it he left me
a team of his own commandos

29:05.780 --> 29:08.983
and failed to mention
your bloody existence?!

29:09.051 --> 29:10.384
I told you to keep that
out of my face.

29:13.122 --> 29:14.322
I warned you.

29:14.390 --> 29:18.861
I give the orders here.

29:18.929 --> 29:21.463
Get used to the pain, mate.

29:21.531 --> 29:23.832
There's plenty more
where that came from.

29:26.005 --> 29:28.405
I don't know who
you people are

29:28.462 --> 29:29.762
but I'm beginning to think

29:29.830 --> 29:31.731
you've been lying
this whole time.

29:31.798 --> 29:33.499
Well, the party's over.

29:33.567 --> 29:35.868
You, big mouth.

29:35.936 --> 29:39.271
You're gonna tell me
what's going on. Now.

29:39.339 --> 29:41.373
<i>When you're being interrogated</i>
<i>in the field,</i>

29:41.441 --> 29:43.075
<i>it's not about holding out.</i>

29:43.143 --> 29:45.745
<i>Field interrogations</i>
<i>tend to be quick and dirty</i>

29:45.813 --> 29:47.413
<i>and often end</i>
<i>with a bullet to the head.</i>

29:47.481 --> 29:49.882
<i>The key to surviving</i>
<i>is a good offense.</i>

29:54.354 --> 29:55.921
Something funny
about this, mate?

29:55.989 --> 29:57.523
<i>When you take a swing</i>
<i>to save your life,</i>

29:57.591 --> 29:59.959
<i>you swing for the fences.</i>

30:00.026 --> 30:01.227
Oh, it's brilliant.

30:01.294 --> 30:04.129
He was the only one
who knew we were coming.

30:05.398 --> 30:08.000
He made sure
we couldn't call out.

30:08.068 --> 30:09.801
How could I have missed it?

30:09.869 --> 30:12.071
Missed what, pray tell?

30:12.139 --> 30:14.172
What, does he need to spell it out
for you? Your boss is behind this.

30:14.240 --> 30:16.574
Jackson?

30:16.642 --> 30:17.976
That's crazy.
Is it?

30:18.043 --> 30:20.010
Our company picks up chatter

30:20.078 --> 30:22.413
someone's trying to sell
the list we already paid for.

30:22.481 --> 30:24.915
We contact Jackson
to demand a security test.

30:24.983 --> 30:26.917
He knows he's busted. He needs
to think of a fall guy quick.

30:26.985 --> 30:29.120
And that would be you,
if you're keeping up.

30:29.187 --> 30:30.922
Jackson expected you
to kill us.

30:30.990 --> 30:33.525
He gave you orders to shoot
intruders on sight, didn't he?

30:33.592 --> 30:34.860
Bollocks.

30:34.928 --> 30:37.362
Jackson knows
trying mischief against me

30:37.430 --> 30:39.131
would be signing
his own death warrant.

30:39.199 --> 30:41.100
My guess --
after you execute us,

30:41.168 --> 30:42.702
his commandos
are gonna shoot you

30:42.770 --> 30:44.604
in a botched attempt
to save us.

30:44.672 --> 30:46.606
Earth to Vanderwall.
Why isn't Jackson still here?

30:46.674 --> 30:48.708
Think about it, man.
The files disappear?

30:48.776 --> 30:50.176
He lays a whole mess
at your feet.

30:50.244 --> 30:51.844
And you won't be able
to call him a liar

30:51.912 --> 30:53.980
because you'll have a bullet
in your head.

30:54.047 --> 30:57.049
If you're so sure, shoot us.

30:57.117 --> 30:59.051
If the commandos don't kill you,

30:59.119 --> 31:01.086
good luck
with the people <i>we</i> work for.

31:07.927 --> 31:11.196
Detain Jackson's men
until you hear from me.

31:11.263 --> 31:13.265
That's an order.

31:13.333 --> 31:15.034
You really think
you can sell this?

31:15.101 --> 31:17.036
I don't have much choice.

31:17.104 --> 31:21.174
My new friend and I are gonna
take a boat to Grand Cayman,

31:21.241 --> 31:23.743
have a little chat
with Commander Jackson.

31:31.686 --> 31:33.553
You made the right move,
soldier.

31:33.621 --> 31:35.321
Yeah, we'll see about that,
won't we?

31:35.389 --> 31:36.656
Yes, we will.

31:36.724 --> 31:38.224
And let's just say
the Pyramid Group

31:38.292 --> 31:41.427
knows how to reward people
who can handle themselves.

31:42.796 --> 31:45.265
So much for dropping in
unnoticed.

31:45.332 --> 31:47.300
Jackson's beefed up
his security.

31:47.367 --> 31:48.534
Can you blame him?

31:48.602 --> 31:51.036
He just stole $10 million worth
of our files.

31:51.104 --> 31:52.337
Bastard.

31:52.405 --> 31:53.605
If we're gonna get
those files,

31:53.673 --> 31:55.240
Jackson can't know
that we're onto him.

31:55.308 --> 31:56.842
Yeah, well, that'll be tough
when I announce

31:56.909 --> 31:59.111
I've got the head of
Pyramid's security with me.

31:59.178 --> 32:01.813
If you do that, we'll get shot
before we make it to the gate.

32:01.881 --> 32:05.150
Just stay calm and say I'm the guy
you want to fix the satellite uplink.

32:05.218 --> 32:07.519
And if they ask
for identification?

32:07.586 --> 32:09.154
You have 50 men
under your command.

32:09.222 --> 32:11.090
You can't handle
two security guards?

32:11.157 --> 32:13.325
<i>For a spy,</i>
<i>getting someone to lie for you</i>

32:13.393 --> 32:15.127
<i>serves a number of purposes.</i>

32:15.195 --> 32:18.865
<i>It's less about the lie itself,</i>
<i>no matter how useful it is.</i>

32:18.933 --> 32:22.836
<i>It's about how it changes your</i>
<i>relationship with your target.</i>

32:22.904 --> 32:24.605
We need to see Jackson.

32:24.672 --> 32:25.806
And who's this?

32:25.874 --> 32:27.374
<i>Once a guy lies for you,</i>

32:27.442 --> 32:30.177
<i>for better or for worse,</i>
<i>your fates are tied together.</i>

32:30.245 --> 32:33.246
He's a tech specialist.
He's okay.

32:33.314 --> 32:34.781
We still need
to see some identif--

32:34.849 --> 32:37.317
What part of "okay"
don't you copy?

32:37.385 --> 32:39.352
I've used him before.

32:39.420 --> 32:41.454
Step aside.

32:46.827 --> 32:49.263
Vanderwall,
where have you been?!

32:49.330 --> 32:51.565
And what the hell happened out there?
Funny --

32:51.633 --> 32:53.901
I've been wanting to ask you
the same question...

32:53.969 --> 32:55.302
Commander.

32:55.370 --> 32:56.537
And what's that
supposed to mean?

32:59.876 --> 33:02.477
You stole the files
from the island.

33:02.545 --> 33:03.645
Where are they?

33:03.713 --> 33:05.181
These files?

33:05.248 --> 33:07.249
I didn't steal them.

33:07.317 --> 33:08.317
I <i>secured</i> them!

33:08.385 --> 33:10.185
And you didn't answer
my question!

33:10.253 --> 33:11.819
Shut it!

33:11.887 --> 33:14.021
You thieving wanker.

33:14.089 --> 33:16.991
We know you sent Cahill
to torch the uplink

33:17.059 --> 33:18.759
so that you could sneak
onto the island

33:18.827 --> 33:20.828
and steal our information.

33:20.895 --> 33:22.496
<i>Your</i> information?

33:22.563 --> 33:24.998
The guard said you were
a satellite technician.

33:25.065 --> 33:26.966
He's from the Pyramid Group.

33:27.033 --> 33:29.468
F.Y.I.,
your security sucks.

33:29.536 --> 33:32.338
He's not from the Pyramid Group,
you moron!

33:32.405 --> 33:34.306
How do you know <i>he</i> didn't
destroy the uplink?!

33:34.374 --> 33:37.343
Save your breath, mate.
Cahill already admitted to --

33:37.411 --> 33:41.180
How do you know Cahill's
not in his pocket?

33:41.248 --> 33:42.682
This guy's playing you!

33:42.749 --> 33:45.451
Take your gun off me
and shoot him!

33:45.519 --> 33:47.286
<i>Like good defense attorneys,</i>

33:47.354 --> 33:49.822
<i>spies know the facts</i>
<i>don't always matter</i>

33:49.890 --> 33:51.390
<i>as much as how you sell them.</i>

33:51.458 --> 33:54.827
<i>Only when lawyers lose a case,</i>
<i>they get an appeal.</i>

33:54.895 --> 33:58.697
<i>When spies lose a case,</i>
<i>they get a shallow grave.</i>

34:01.035 --> 34:02.368
Bravo.

34:02.436 --> 34:05.338
That was compelling
and rich.

34:05.406 --> 34:07.908
One of two things
is possible.

34:07.975 --> 34:10.543
Either Jackson
ripped you off

34:10.610 --> 34:11.911
and we caught him
red-handed...

34:13.181 --> 34:14.246
Or?

34:14.315 --> 34:17.284
...You let a mysterious
super-genius

34:17.351 --> 34:20.321
take over your island,
turn your op inside out,

34:20.389 --> 34:23.592
and detain
your commander's men.

34:23.659 --> 34:24.993
Which is more likely?

34:26.596 --> 34:28.563
One of two things
will happen now.

34:28.632 --> 34:30.699
Version one --

34:30.766 --> 34:33.502
you will take over for
commander stickyfingers here,

34:33.570 --> 34:35.971
and my boss will shower you
with cash.

34:36.038 --> 34:37.873
Version two --

34:37.940 --> 34:41.208
you will eat a bullet
right after I do!

34:41.275 --> 34:42.577
I've had enough of this!

34:44.480 --> 34:45.646
Stand down!

34:45.714 --> 34:48.248
Stand down!

34:52.255 --> 34:54.322
Jackson's been relieved
of his command.

34:56.193 --> 34:58.628
I'm in charge now.

34:58.695 --> 35:00.196
Anybody got a problem
with that?

35:00.264 --> 35:02.132
Good.

35:02.200 --> 35:03.333
Now...

35:03.401 --> 35:06.170
Somebody get me a whiskey.

35:13.245 --> 35:14.579
How was the ride over?

35:14.646 --> 35:16.247
Oh, it was
a pleasure cruise.

35:16.315 --> 35:18.717
Turns out Mr. Cahill gets
really, really seasick.

35:18.785 --> 35:20.652
No, no, no, no, no.
No. No.

35:22.021 --> 35:24.356
We're taking him back to Pyramid HQ
for further questioning.

35:24.424 --> 35:27.059
Excellent work securing
the files, Mr. Vanderwall.

35:27.127 --> 35:29.195
We're postponing
the South American portion

35:29.262 --> 35:31.431
of the operation
till we sort things out,

35:31.498 --> 35:32.732
but you...

35:33.834 --> 35:36.036
...You'll be
well taken care of.

35:36.104 --> 35:38.205
Forgive me for not taking
your word for it.

35:38.273 --> 35:39.573
The files stay with me.

35:39.641 --> 35:41.642
Vanderwall,
what are you doing?

35:41.710 --> 35:45.279
I just put a bullet
in my boss, sweetheart.

35:45.347 --> 35:47.982
I hand this over
when your boss hands me

35:48.050 --> 35:50.785
a signed contract
putting me in command.

35:50.853 --> 35:52.554
I want something
I can feel...

35:52.622 --> 35:56.057
Something I can touch,
understand?

35:56.959 --> 35:58.626
You're a man who knows
what he wants.

35:58.694 --> 36:02.396
Trust me. You will get more
than you can possibly imagine.

36:04.333 --> 36:06.033
I'm tired
of your chat, mate.

36:06.101 --> 36:09.236
You're gonna make a call
to the Pyramid Group right now

36:09.304 --> 36:13.107
and arrange a sit-down for me
with your boss.

36:13.175 --> 36:15.709
If for any reason
that's a problem,

36:15.777 --> 36:17.378
then <i>we're</i> gonna have
a problem.

36:17.445 --> 36:19.080
There's no problem here.

36:19.147 --> 36:21.382
Do you think that
you could arrange a flight

36:21.450 --> 36:22.984
to take all of us
back to headquarters?

36:23.052 --> 36:24.753
It would be my pleasure.

36:35.097 --> 36:37.832
Sorry.
No guns on the chopper.

36:37.899 --> 36:39.800
We'll bring our guns
if we damn well please.

36:39.868 --> 36:41.536
Unless you want to take them,
of course.

36:41.603 --> 36:44.505
<i>Disarming people by force</i>
<i>is bloody and unpleasant.</i>

36:44.573 --> 36:46.040
Company policy,
Vanderwall.

36:46.108 --> 36:47.875
Then make an exception.

36:47.943 --> 36:51.512
<i>Sometimes it's easier</i>
<i>to put on a smile and just ask.</i>

36:51.579 --> 36:53.014
It's a corporate chopper.

36:53.081 --> 36:54.515
It's overweight as it is.

36:54.583 --> 36:55.916
Come on.
It's time to celebrate.

36:55.984 --> 36:58.052
Pop the champagne,
<i>commander!</i>

36:58.119 --> 36:59.786
Come on. Let's go.

37:08.096 --> 37:10.064
Okay.

37:10.132 --> 37:12.600
No one mentioned you boys
from the Pyramid Group

37:12.668 --> 37:13.768
were wired so tight.

37:16.171 --> 37:18.840
That's 'cause they're CIA.
We all are, actually.

37:21.510 --> 37:22.977
Son of a bitch.

37:28.884 --> 37:32.653
How's that for something
you can feel, Mr. Vanderwall?

37:34.490 --> 37:36.558
Get these to the top brass
at the NSA.

37:36.626 --> 37:39.194
Shouldn't be hard for them
to find their leak.

37:39.262 --> 37:41.697
Anybody ever tell you your brand
of espionage is hell on the nerves?

37:42.865 --> 37:44.066
All the time.

37:54.205 --> 37:55.773
Lovely evening
for an arms deal.

37:55.841 --> 37:58.343
I want my information
first.

37:58.410 --> 37:59.811
You know
I always deliver.

37:59.878 --> 38:01.246
We're alike that way.

38:01.313 --> 38:03.281
What's that
supposed to mean?

38:03.349 --> 38:05.350
Tell me something.

38:05.418 --> 38:07.086
Are you happy?

38:07.153 --> 38:10.055
Was it worth it?

38:10.123 --> 38:12.425
Coming here to live
with an absentee boyfriend

38:12.493 --> 38:15.095
in his drab, little flat?

38:15.162 --> 38:17.431
You were meant for
much, much greater things.

38:17.499 --> 38:18.933
Like what?
Working with you?

38:20.335 --> 38:22.303
No, thanks.

38:22.371 --> 38:24.206
Let's get this over with,
shall we?

38:24.273 --> 38:25.440
Of course.

38:31.213 --> 38:35.650
You should know your boyfriend
has some nasty enemies.

38:35.718 --> 38:37.986
If anything should happen,
remember...

38:38.053 --> 38:40.121
You and I have
a lot in common.

38:40.189 --> 38:43.224
I'm just
a phone call away.

38:43.292 --> 38:44.726
A lot in common?

38:44.793 --> 38:46.494
No.

38:46.562 --> 38:48.663
I don't trade favors
for blood.

38:48.731 --> 38:49.964
Why do you say that?

38:51.366 --> 38:53.034
Because you spared
the guards?

38:53.102 --> 38:55.469
You should know something.

38:55.537 --> 38:57.137
That truck
was supposed to be delivered

38:57.205 --> 38:58.772
to a rival of mine.

38:58.840 --> 39:01.341
Regrettably,
he presold the ammunition

39:01.409 --> 39:04.377
to a Mexican cartel.

39:04.445 --> 39:06.279
Now he's in some hot water.

39:06.346 --> 39:08.080
When I say "Hot water,"

39:08.148 --> 39:10.149
I mean the poor guy's
been dismembered.

39:11.952 --> 39:14.287
So maybe we're not so different
after all.

39:14.354 --> 39:16.089
You bastard.

39:16.156 --> 39:17.990
Oh, we know
what kind of man <i>I</i> am.

39:18.058 --> 39:20.793
What I'd really like
to know is...

39:20.861 --> 39:25.332
What kind of man
sends you for my help?

39:32.974 --> 39:35.176
It was good
seeing you again!

39:35.243 --> 39:37.011
I've missed you, Fiona.

39:46.888 --> 39:49.323
Sorry I'm late.

39:49.391 --> 39:52.193
Pearce and I had a...

39:52.261 --> 39:54.395
debrief at the Agency.

39:54.463 --> 39:57.030
It's fine.
How was your mission?

39:57.098 --> 39:59.699
It was, uh, rough.

39:59.767 --> 40:01.601
I mean, it worked out,
but, uh...

40:01.669 --> 40:04.237
You can't talk about it.
Whatever.

40:04.305 --> 40:06.973
The lead on your bomber.

40:08.443 --> 40:09.509
How'd the job go?

40:10.645 --> 40:12.847
Does it matter?
You got what you needed.

40:15.651 --> 40:17.485
Fi...What's going on?

40:19.055 --> 40:21.256
Did something happen
with Armand?

40:21.324 --> 40:22.524
Ohh.

40:22.592 --> 40:25.094
Now you're full
of questions.

40:25.161 --> 40:26.996
A lot happened
with Armand.

40:27.063 --> 40:30.465
Years ago back in Ireland
in the bad, old days.

40:33.236 --> 40:35.036
Were you and he, uh...

40:35.104 --> 40:36.471
Yes, we were, Michael.

40:38.207 --> 40:41.175
Until I found out
that he had "paid" to meet me

40:41.242 --> 40:44.478
by doing a favor
for some of my associates.

40:45.914 --> 40:48.682
He killed a British customs
agent, if you're curious.

40:48.750 --> 40:51.318
Quite a romantic gesture,
don't you think?

40:51.386 --> 40:52.653
I didn't know that,
Fiona.

40:52.721 --> 40:55.022
No. You didn't.

40:56.325 --> 40:58.626
Ignorance is bliss.

40:58.694 --> 41:00.361
Oh, there they are.

41:00.429 --> 41:01.429
Hi!

41:03.065 --> 41:04.967
Benny, may I introduce my son, Michael?
Michael.

41:05.034 --> 41:06.835
And his very special lady,
Fiona.

41:06.903 --> 41:08.337
My pleasure.

41:08.405 --> 41:09.705
Here, let me get that
for you.

41:09.773 --> 41:11.106
Oh, thank you.

41:11.174 --> 41:12.975
Dinner is my treat.

41:13.043 --> 41:15.144
Benny actually sat through
an entire stretching class

41:15.212 --> 41:16.679
with me today,
so I owe him.

41:16.747 --> 41:18.214
It was a blast --

41:18.282 --> 41:21.352
in a "I hope we never have to
do it again" kind of way.

41:22.621 --> 41:25.689
I knew it.
You are so bad!

41:25.757 --> 41:29.026
Michael, your mom has told me
so much about you.

41:29.093 --> 41:32.262
Well, I took the liberty
of ordering some wine.

41:32.330 --> 41:33.430
May I?

41:33.498 --> 41:34.865
Please.
Please.

41:36.300 --> 41:39.536
How about a toast
from the young lovebirds?

41:39.603 --> 41:40.703
What do you say?

41:40.771 --> 41:42.972
Yes.
Michael, a toast.

41:44.707 --> 41:46.675
To supportive partners.

41:46.743 --> 41:49.077
Ohh.
Supportive partners.

41:49.145 --> 41:52.047
Supportive partners.
Supportive partners.
