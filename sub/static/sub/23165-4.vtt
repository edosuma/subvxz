01:07.900 --> 01:09.935
Is a golden amber
Luminescence --

01:10.003 --> 01:11.170
But not too golden.

01:11.204 --> 01:12.605
Better too amber
Than too golden.

01:12.674 --> 01:15.408
And don't be taken in
By these rebel purveyors.

01:15.444 --> 01:18.445
They'd just as soon
Fill a bottle with sarsaparilla

01:18.514 --> 01:20.380
And mark it
"gosset grand millesime."

01:21.617 --> 01:23.586
Have it in miss hastings' room
By 7:00.

01:23.620 --> 01:24.953
Two flutes.

01:25.021 --> 01:26.555
On the quiet, son.

01:26.591 --> 01:29.092
Doctor on the ward!

01:29.126 --> 01:30.895
What have we here?

01:37.605 --> 01:39.138
The bromine
Seems to have helped.

01:39.207 --> 01:40.373
No sign of erysipelas.

01:40.408 --> 01:42.241
That dressing
Is exceptional.

01:42.277 --> 01:44.110
Miss hastings' work,
I presume?

01:44.146 --> 01:45.479
Yes, doctor.

01:45.548 --> 01:48.048
Her technique bears
An unmistakable artistry.

01:48.084 --> 01:49.551
And it don't itch a bit.

01:49.586 --> 01:51.921
Mm. Are you familiar
With the hospital regulations,

01:51.955 --> 01:53.455
-private sutter?
-yes, sir, doctor.

01:53.491 --> 01:56.125
Then you should know
You are to remain at a salute

01:56.161 --> 01:58.095
Until given leave
By a ranking officer,

01:58.130 --> 01:59.631
Such as myself,
To do otherwise.

01:59.666 --> 02:01.133
One of your special rounds,
Doctor?

02:01.167 --> 02:03.569
Order and discipline
Is the word of the day, matron.

02:03.604 --> 02:05.805
Those are two words, I believe.

02:05.840 --> 02:07.306
Bend the rules,
They will break!

02:07.341 --> 02:09.174
Ah, roast duck,
Duck pâté,

02:09.243 --> 02:11.478
Duck soup,
Duck with wine and jelly.

02:11.513 --> 02:14.115
Is it me,
Or is there a theme emerging?

02:14.150 --> 02:16.117
Fish got here putrid,
Matron.

02:16.153 --> 02:18.988
Beef?
Derailed outside of baltimore,
Along with the pork.

02:19.023 --> 02:20.122
Have we no chicken?

02:20.158 --> 02:21.491
-pox, matron.
-pox?

02:21.526 --> 02:23.994
When one shows symptoms,
All must be put down.

02:24.030 --> 02:26.330
Well, we can't very well
Serve duck nine ways.

02:26.366 --> 02:28.166
Dignitaries
Will be in attendance.

02:28.202 --> 02:30.035
Major summers
Has me seeing to it

02:30.103 --> 02:32.003
That the event
Goes off swimmingly,

02:32.040 --> 02:35.008
So make it your mission,
Mr. Bullen,

02:35.043 --> 02:36.810
To procure a proper menu.

02:36.845 --> 02:38.279
I know you have your ways.

02:38.313 --> 02:40.448
What am I now --
Lady of the house?

02:40.484 --> 02:42.651
-be right with you, soldier.
-good morning, matron brannan.

02:42.687 --> 02:43.652
Starboard side,
Miss phinney.

02:43.688 --> 02:45.555
She comes
With a bone in her teeth.

02:45.624 --> 02:46.556
Miss phinney?

02:46.592 --> 02:48.893
I hear dr. Foster's
Come down with a fever.

02:48.962 --> 02:49.961
Yes.

02:49.996 --> 02:51.396
He was hoping
To maintain

02:51.465 --> 02:54.065
-a certain quietude about it.
-of course.

02:54.133 --> 02:56.301
That masculine
Forbearance of his.

02:56.336 --> 02:58.972
But you must know
That i've had vast experience

02:59.006 --> 03:00.540
With influenza
In the crimea.

03:00.575 --> 03:03.176
Your advice
Is much appreciated.
My advice?

03:03.212 --> 03:06.080
No, I wish for the good doctor
To be properly tended to.

03:06.148 --> 03:08.050
-i can assure you --
-personally.

03:08.085 --> 03:09.251
Personally?

03:09.320 --> 03:12.022
I'd like to look in on him
Myself.

03:12.056 --> 03:13.056
I see.

03:13.092 --> 03:15.158
Well,
You should be aware then

03:15.194 --> 03:17.995
That it may not be
Influenza at all.

03:18.031 --> 03:22.267
Dr. Foster is gravely concerned
That he has contracted the...

03:22.336 --> 03:24.070
The speckled monster.

03:24.105 --> 03:25.105
Smallpox?

03:25.172 --> 03:26.906
All symptoms
Point to it --

03:26.942 --> 03:29.576
Malaise, headache, prostration,
Tenderness to touch.

03:29.611 --> 03:31.913
-to touch, you say?
-so he describes.

03:31.948 --> 03:34.215
The doctor is administering
His own care.

03:34.251 --> 03:35.518
Is he?

03:35.553 --> 03:37.888
Adamantly so,
As he worries he is infectious.

03:37.922 --> 03:39.588
But surely,
An intimate visit from you

03:39.624 --> 03:41.390
Would help to raise
His spirits.

03:41.426 --> 03:43.426
What time shall I tell him
You're coming?

03:43.462 --> 03:46.364
If he's adamant, an intrusion
Would only upset him.

03:46.398 --> 03:49.935
Oh, poor dr. Foster,
Taking this all on alone.

03:49.971 --> 03:52.472
I hear his wife
Has even left him.

03:52.541 --> 03:55.909
I am ignorant
As to his connubial standing.

03:55.945 --> 03:58.412
I will pray
For his speedy recovery.

03:58.447 --> 03:59.414
Yes.

03:59.448 --> 04:01.283
We all will.

04:20.375 --> 04:23.477
Good morning,
Dr. Foster.

04:23.513 --> 04:27.148
The staff offer
Their prayers.

04:27.184 --> 04:30.586
 prayers?
It's only a mild fever.

04:30.621 --> 04:32.288
It's smallpox now.

04:32.323 --> 04:33.990
Smallpox? Why?

04:34.026 --> 04:36.493
Influenza wasn't sufficient
To ward off the well-wishers.

04:36.529 --> 04:38.096
Especially miss hastings,

04:38.132 --> 04:40.999
Who has taken a special interest
In your health.

04:41.036 --> 04:43.436
Well, then, she will be
Especially relieved

04:43.471 --> 04:46.974
To hear of my swift
And miraculous recovery.

04:47.009 --> 04:48.876
-your recovery?
-yes.

04:48.945 --> 04:51.979
I seem to have only
A vague memory of a recollection

04:52.015 --> 04:55.283
Of a compulsion to inject myself
With a foreign substance.

04:55.318 --> 04:58.621
I see you received the mail
I had the boy bring up.
Mm.

04:58.656 --> 05:01.458
Cheering words
From the home front,

05:01.493 --> 05:02.861
Like morning dew.

05:02.896 --> 05:04.062
That said...

05:04.131 --> 05:06.966
The sun shines,
The sky is blue,

05:07.001 --> 05:10.370
And dr. Foster would very much
Like to get back to work.

05:10.405 --> 05:13.874
It's not even been a week.
Are you sure you're ready?

05:13.909 --> 05:15.308
Oh, empirically so!

05:16.344 --> 05:19.081
Look here.

05:19.150 --> 05:22.185
Duration of sleep,
Intensity of perspiration,

05:22.219 --> 05:24.220
Growing appetite,
Diminishing hallucinations,

05:24.256 --> 05:25.890
Et cetera, et cetera.

05:25.924 --> 05:28.558
The statistics all point to
A man on the mend!

05:28.594 --> 05:30.095
Clearly.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.531
Dr. Foster has been to hell
And has returned triumphant.

05:32.565 --> 05:34.901
The poppy conquered
Half of china,

05:34.936 --> 05:37.569
But it couldn't beat
Jedidiah foster, could it?

05:37.605 --> 05:39.273
Why do you speak
Like that?

05:39.341 --> 05:40.274
Like what?

05:40.342 --> 05:42.209
Like you're not here.

05:42.245 --> 05:43.912
Because up here...

05:43.947 --> 05:46.181
I'm not in here.

05:46.217 --> 05:49.119
I'm already out there.

05:55.261 --> 05:56.761
Key, please.

05:56.797 --> 05:59.430
I know
You are feeling idle.
Give me the key now!

05:59.466 --> 06:01.600
But you are in no condition
To assess patients,

06:01.635 --> 06:03.069
Let alone operate, and I --

06:03.103 --> 06:05.939
Give me
The goddamn key!

06:07.576 --> 06:09.977
Do you wish to go so badly?
Then go on!

06:10.047 --> 06:12.949
Go on!

06:17.156 --> 06:19.958
Tremors from deprivation
Of the narcotic.

06:28.903 --> 06:31.137
We made a pact.

06:31.173 --> 06:35.776
I promised to help you.
You promised to submit.

06:35.811 --> 06:38.914
I urge you
To stay the course.

06:48.327 --> 06:50.528
Miss phinney...

06:50.596 --> 06:55.368
When the conversation
Is over...

06:55.436 --> 06:58.940
We take our key
And we go.

07:10.488 --> 07:11.955
A ball?

07:11.990 --> 07:13.925
In our home?

07:13.960 --> 07:16.327
Commandeering our house
For quartering

07:16.363 --> 07:17.629
Wasn't sufficient.

07:17.663 --> 07:20.099
Now they fully intend
To dance in it.

07:20.135 --> 07:21.334
-barbarians!

07:21.369 --> 07:23.304
-we'll resist.
-well, of course we will.

07:23.338 --> 07:26.040
How? By poisoning
The punch bowl?

07:26.108 --> 07:27.208
Leave father alone.

07:27.277 --> 07:28.777
He's doing his best.

07:28.812 --> 07:30.145
So I am.

07:30.181 --> 07:32.713
And, yes,
I am in a delicate predicament,

07:32.750 --> 07:34.917
Which I prefer to handle
With finesse.

07:34.986 --> 07:37.654
And if that requires
That we play good hosts,

07:37.689 --> 07:40.992
Well, we can all
Pretend a little.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.063
We should start in here.

07:48.103 --> 07:50.371
Never!

07:58.782 --> 08:02.919
I would never cross you
In front of the ladies.

08:02.954 --> 08:04.754
But they're right.

08:04.790 --> 08:08.093
You must stop conceding,
Giving in.

08:08.128 --> 08:09.260
Jimmy, please --

08:09.296 --> 08:11.597
You forbade me from joining up,
And now what?

08:11.632 --> 08:13.299
I'm seen as a coward,
An embarrassment.

08:13.368 --> 08:14.601
We both are.

08:14.635 --> 08:16.903
-that's not so.
-it is!

08:16.939 --> 08:18.205
Other people's sons

08:18.240 --> 08:21.109
Are off fighting those bastards
In battle

08:21.144 --> 08:23.745
And i'm here, fighting them
For time in the water closet.

08:23.779 --> 08:25.447
And now you
Want to do what?

08:25.483 --> 08:27.950
Throw the yanks
A cotillion?

08:27.986 --> 08:30.121
It's sickening.
It's unmanly.

08:30.156 --> 08:31.622
I can't bear it!

08:31.657 --> 08:33.724
I burned that paper
That they gave me.

08:33.760 --> 08:34.758
I have a plan!

08:37.832 --> 08:41.967
The sons of liberty threw tea
Into the harbor.

08:42.003 --> 08:45.806
And now we just sit around
Drinking it.

08:58.926 --> 09:01.026
We beat them back
At drewry's bluff.

09:01.095 --> 09:02.794
Things keep going
Our way,

09:02.829 --> 09:04.829
The yanks will be done
By autumn.

09:04.865 --> 09:07.667
And then we go back
To how it was.

09:07.702 --> 09:10.938
Where were we
When this whole mess started?

09:10.973 --> 09:12.540
Ah, yes.

09:12.608 --> 09:16.878
You were set to marry
That impossibly handsome fellow.

09:16.947 --> 09:18.147
What was his name?

09:18.183 --> 09:19.683
Oh, I don't remember.

09:19.717 --> 09:21.050
I've already moved on.

09:21.119 --> 09:23.221
Oh, now,
Don't break his heart.

09:23.290 --> 09:25.690
You know
He is the jealous kind.

09:25.725 --> 09:27.125
Oh, too bad.

09:27.159 --> 09:29.160
I've already fallen in love
With someone else.

09:30.397 --> 09:34.032
An impossibly handsome
Dentist.

09:34.069 --> 09:36.703
A dentist.

09:36.738 --> 09:38.139
He sounds respectable.

09:38.174 --> 09:39.340
Very.

09:39.375 --> 09:41.676
We plan to be
Impossibly happy together.

09:41.712 --> 09:43.980
Well, your father
Will be pleased.

09:44.014 --> 09:45.582
If he survives tonight.

09:45.650 --> 09:48.219
The yanks are holding a ball
In our house.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.353
What for?

09:49.388 --> 09:52.523
Aside from our family
Humiliation?

09:52.558 --> 09:54.392
The officers organized it

09:54.427 --> 09:56.728
To raise money
For their war widows.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.864
All the officers
Will be there?

09:58.899 --> 09:59.933
Well, I suppose.

10:00.002 --> 10:02.001
Now,
That's a stroke of luck.

10:02.037 --> 10:04.439
How can you say
Such a thing?

10:04.508 --> 10:08.277
Emma, I need to talk to you
About tom.

10:08.346 --> 10:10.413
How is his condition?

10:10.448 --> 10:12.249
He's slowly improving.

10:12.284 --> 10:15.718
Soon they'll ship him off
To a prisoner camp.

10:15.754 --> 10:17.454
No, they won't.

10:17.523 --> 10:21.893
Tom's not going anywhere,
Not until he's seen the dentist.

10:31.575 --> 10:33.575
Oh!

10:33.610 --> 10:36.045
Ooh.

10:42.754 --> 10:43.788
Are you ill?

10:47.460 --> 10:49.428
A fever going about.

10:49.463 --> 10:51.097
I hear dr. Foster's come --

10:51.131 --> 10:52.332
I ain't got no fever.

10:52.401 --> 10:55.435
You should let someone
Check your temperature.

10:55.471 --> 10:57.406
Maybe you should
Let me alone.

11:00.177 --> 11:02.411
Tired is all it is.

11:02.446 --> 11:03.812
Nothing more.

11:03.848 --> 11:06.015
And I got work to do.

11:06.084 --> 11:08.652
She don't concern you.

11:08.688 --> 11:12.957
You hear me, boy?

11:12.992 --> 11:17.664
You come down out of the north,
A free man,

11:17.699 --> 11:21.969
Fixing to be
Nigger king of alexandria.

11:22.004 --> 11:24.606
Don't work like that.

11:24.640 --> 11:28.009
You still have to answer
When you're spoken to.

11:28.044 --> 11:29.811
Now, I asked you
A question.

11:29.847 --> 11:31.715
I heard it.

11:31.783 --> 11:36.454
Then I won't have to ask again,
Will i?

11:40.394 --> 11:42.528
No, sir.

11:42.564 --> 11:44.998
You won't.

11:54.579 --> 11:57.147
Gentlemen, please!
It's an heirloom!

11:57.181 --> 12:00.150
Here lies
Great-grandmama's credenza!

12:00.185 --> 12:02.420
It survived
The revolution, 1812,

12:02.489 --> 12:04.355
Two house fires,
And a flood,

12:04.392 --> 12:07.393
But was mortally wounded
During the battle of the ball!

12:07.429 --> 12:08.727
Darling, remember --

12:08.764 --> 12:10.897
Oh, I know, I know.
They are merely objects.

12:10.931 --> 12:13.065
No, please,
Not the oriental vase, please!

12:13.101 --> 12:14.668
Do something,
Do something!

12:14.704 --> 12:17.004
It's personal property
Of great sentimental value.

12:17.039 --> 12:19.408
I ask you not to remove it
From this house!

12:19.443 --> 12:21.910
Yes, sir.

12:21.946 --> 12:25.783
Oh, my gracious!

12:25.851 --> 12:28.886
I'll have your girl
Sweep it up.

12:36.130 --> 12:39.065
A moment with the missus,
If I may?

12:43.707 --> 12:46.074
Mr. Bullen
Is it?

12:46.109 --> 12:47.909
Uh, yes, missus, uh...

12:47.946 --> 12:51.281
Um, I have a bill of fare
For you to examine.

12:51.316 --> 12:52.950
My kitchen staff
Will prepare it.

12:52.985 --> 12:54.318
How considerate.

12:54.387 --> 12:56.987
If only the greeks had run it
By the trojans first.

12:57.056 --> 12:59.658
"oh, do you mind us
Bringing in this horse

12:59.727 --> 13:02.061
Filled with all these
Hostile soldiers?"

13:02.095 --> 13:04.997
We've no plans
To serve horse, ma'am.

13:05.066 --> 13:06.900
Oh, no.
This will not do.

13:06.935 --> 13:10.405
This is a paltry menu,
Which will be further butchered

13:10.441 --> 13:12.507
By that brutish staff
Of yours.

13:12.576 --> 13:14.443
I will be a laughingstock.

13:14.480 --> 13:15.445
Madam...

13:16.515 --> 13:19.349
Come.
We will sort this out.

13:19.418 --> 13:21.651
Come on!

13:21.688 --> 13:25.122
I hope you will attend
The festivities this evening.

13:25.158 --> 13:27.826
Allow us to show you
A touch of southern hospitality.

13:27.863 --> 13:30.497
-that sounds wonderful, miss.
-you could moan a little.

13:30.532 --> 13:32.032
I am moaning.

13:32.101 --> 13:33.000
Like you mean it.

13:33.035 --> 13:34.968
Don't make me pull
One out for real.

13:35.005 --> 13:36.471
Agh! Agh!

13:36.507 --> 13:39.108
There's an empty room
On the second floor

13:39.142 --> 13:40.676
Where it's quiet.

13:40.712 --> 13:43.814
Emma will unlock a window
Before she leaves.

13:43.848 --> 13:46.884
Near 9:00, she and alice
Will be distracting

13:46.952 --> 13:50.288
Those two bluebellies,
Keeping them busy at the ball

13:50.323 --> 13:52.691
While I slip in
And get you out of here.

13:52.727 --> 13:53.959
You'll be ready?

13:53.994 --> 13:55.061
Uh-huh.

13:55.130 --> 13:56.696
What time?

13:56.732 --> 13:58.498
9:00.

13:58.535 --> 13:59.534
Frank...

14:01.739 --> 14:05.039
Remember when we used to plan
To travel the world?

14:05.075 --> 14:06.875
You, me, and jimmy green.

14:06.911 --> 14:09.679
You remember that?

14:09.714 --> 14:12.750
How come we never
Went anywhere?

14:14.053 --> 14:16.521
When this war is won,

14:16.557 --> 14:20.059
We'll go
Wherever you like, tom.

14:20.094 --> 14:24.397
We'll go to texas
And wrangle horses

14:24.433 --> 14:26.734
Or out west
To mine for gold.

14:26.769 --> 14:28.436
But first, we --

14:28.504 --> 14:30.738
I fear
I may be woefully...

14:30.774 --> 14:32.675
Remember what I told you.

14:32.710 --> 14:34.911
9:00 -- got it.

14:37.716 --> 14:39.884
Toothache?

14:39.919 --> 14:41.586
Frank:
Nothing too serious.

14:41.621 --> 14:42.888
Well, since you're here,

14:42.923 --> 14:45.123
There's a boy
With a terrible case of rotjaw.

14:45.193 --> 14:47.393
Rotjaw?

14:47.428 --> 14:49.864
Well,
Isn't that contagious?

14:49.899 --> 14:51.430
I don't believe so.

14:51.466 --> 14:53.767
-it sounds contagious.
-chaplain hopkins.

14:53.803 --> 14:55.937
I was in need
Of a good bible passage

14:55.972 --> 14:57.739
To recommend
A wounded boy,

14:57.774 --> 15:00.610
And you were
Nowhere to be found.

15:00.645 --> 15:03.780
Well, point me to the man.
I'll be sure to guide him.

15:03.816 --> 15:05.315
Will you, um...

15:05.385 --> 15:08.653
Will I be seeing you
At the ball this evening?

15:08.722 --> 15:10.322
I'll be there.

15:10.391 --> 15:14.459
Perhaps you would give me
The pleasure of your hand?

15:14.495 --> 15:16.763
I'd enjoy that
Very much.

15:16.797 --> 15:18.798
Good.

16:16.540 --> 16:19.809
You've hardly touched
This food.

16:22.581 --> 16:23.815
Voilà!

16:23.850 --> 16:26.851
Already improved
Since this morning.

16:26.886 --> 16:31.023
Oh, I am only a short time away
From freedom.

16:31.058 --> 16:32.925
Soon enough, i'm sure.

16:32.994 --> 16:35.695
The letter --
Who's it from?

16:37.533 --> 16:38.532
Ezra.

16:38.568 --> 16:40.067
My brother.

16:40.104 --> 16:41.403
How's he faring?

16:41.438 --> 16:43.338
Oh, the wound is healing
Well enough.

16:43.374 --> 16:45.074
He's been fitted
For a peg leg.

16:45.110 --> 16:47.610
And soon he will be moved
To jail.

16:47.679 --> 16:49.012
Oh, and he curses me.

16:49.048 --> 16:50.580
Curses you?

16:50.616 --> 16:52.517
It seems mother and he
Have been speaking,

16:52.551 --> 16:54.085
And he is of the mind

16:54.121 --> 16:56.421
That I did not need
To amputate his leg,

16:56.456 --> 16:58.423
That I did not get consent
From him

16:58.459 --> 16:59.893
When he was of sound mind,

16:59.927 --> 17:02.530
That I am a traitor and a liar
And a scoundrel,

17:02.564 --> 17:04.365
And he disowns me
As his brother.

17:04.400 --> 17:07.102
You saved him
From certain death.

17:07.137 --> 17:09.873
Yes. Yes.

17:09.906 --> 17:12.776
I'm so sorry
To hear that.

17:14.713 --> 17:16.378
Are you?

17:16.415 --> 17:18.648
Are you sorry?

17:18.718 --> 17:20.719
I am.

17:20.752 --> 17:23.556
You enjoy it rather,
Don't you?

17:23.589 --> 17:25.759
I don't know what you mean.

17:25.794 --> 17:27.560
Misery.

17:27.596 --> 17:30.098
People in misery,
My misery...

17:30.133 --> 17:31.465
You enjoy it.

17:31.501 --> 17:32.667
That's not so.

17:32.736 --> 17:33.968
I think it is.

17:34.003 --> 17:36.571
I think you like
Locking me up in here,

17:36.607 --> 17:38.473
This miserable,
Stunted man.

17:38.509 --> 17:39.910
Not at all.

17:39.945 --> 17:42.645
Abandoned by my wife,
Addicted to morphine,

17:42.681 --> 17:44.115
Shamed by my family.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.316
Not shamed, no.

17:45.351 --> 17:46.819
-you pity me.
-i respect you!

17:46.854 --> 17:48.486
Don't patronize me,
Miss phinney.

17:48.523 --> 17:49.989
I vowed to help you.

17:50.024 --> 17:51.457
Ah, yes.

17:51.492 --> 17:53.159
Yes.
Angel of mercy.

17:53.196 --> 17:55.629
And I am doing my best
To care for you.

17:55.664 --> 17:59.000
Do it much longer, i'll end up
As dead as the poor old baron.

17:59.035 --> 18:01.001
Is that why
You enjoy it?

18:01.038 --> 18:04.340
Because it reminds you
Of home?

18:05.878 --> 18:09.646
Is every dying boy another
Chance to save your husband?

18:20.995 --> 18:23.865
Are you...

18:23.899 --> 18:26.068
I -- i'm...

18:26.137 --> 18:27.702
No!

18:27.738 --> 18:31.507
That's enough.

18:33.512 --> 18:35.212
I will not be here
This evening.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.983
There is a ball
At the green home I must attend.

18:38.018 --> 18:41.020
Sister isabelle
Will look in on you.

18:45.559 --> 18:47.194
You call that cake?

18:47.228 --> 18:49.029
I call it
A belle alliance, missus,

18:49.064 --> 18:50.731
'cause that's
What it's called.

18:50.766 --> 18:52.066
Well,
Let me tell you,

18:52.102 --> 18:54.736
This is no belle alliance
We are having here.

18:54.772 --> 18:56.739
And I do not mean
The cake, sir.

18:56.775 --> 18:59.409
Mister bullen,
I'm makin' what i'm makin',

18:59.444 --> 19:01.179
No matter
What this fine lady say.

19:01.214 --> 19:02.947
Madam, if I may,

19:03.016 --> 19:05.617
We did not intend for you
To trouble yourself over this.

19:05.652 --> 19:07.452
It was only meant
As a courtesy.

19:07.521 --> 19:08.955
Indeed,
But since you already have,

19:09.024 --> 19:11.725
I fully intend to make sure
That my reputation is upheld.

19:11.759 --> 19:14.761
The standards of this household
Will not be brought down

19:14.797 --> 19:18.399
To the levels
Of base yankee coarseness.

19:18.435 --> 19:20.101
Belinda...

19:20.138 --> 19:22.404
Apples a la parisienne.

19:22.440 --> 19:25.609
Miss green,
We ain't got but a few hours.

19:25.644 --> 19:27.411
Where are we gonna get

19:27.447 --> 19:29.947
That many apples and cherries
And 48 --

19:29.983 --> 19:32.650
Mr. Bullen will supply
The ingredients.

19:32.719 --> 19:34.887
Mrs. Green,
I-i must say that --

19:34.922 --> 19:38.090
Do I need to confer
With the major?

19:39.495 --> 19:41.229
I thought not.

19:57.016 --> 20:00.119
You're a sight
For sore eyes.

20:00.153 --> 20:04.624
I thought you could use
Some fresh clothes.

20:04.659 --> 20:06.659
From jimmy's closet.

20:06.696 --> 20:08.596
Thank him for me.

20:08.631 --> 20:11.800
I would
If he knew I took 'em.

20:20.212 --> 20:24.015
I hear you're having
A shindig tonight.

20:24.051 --> 20:26.651
mama's completely
Lost her mind.

20:26.687 --> 20:29.488
She doesn't know
Whether to impress the yanks

20:29.524 --> 20:32.526
With her best home cooking
Or lace it with arsenic.

20:32.561 --> 20:35.196
She'll probably try both.

20:39.136 --> 20:43.372
You don't have to worry.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.208
I know it.

20:47.212 --> 20:48.579
Do you?

20:50.918 --> 20:53.385
Have you spoken
With emma?

21:00.431 --> 21:04.565
There's something inside
I brought for you,

21:04.601 --> 21:06.435
A keepsake.

21:10.675 --> 21:13.277
Until tomorrow then.

21:36.642 --> 21:39.210
Not so tight.
I can hardly breathe.

21:39.245 --> 21:43.748
First, it was too loose.
Now it's too tight?

21:43.783 --> 21:45.118
What's this?

21:45.153 --> 21:46.952
We're getting ready
For the ball.

21:46.989 --> 21:48.554
"we"?

21:48.589 --> 21:51.158
Persimmon or sage?
Mother, what do you think?

21:51.227 --> 21:53.593
I really don't know
What to think.

21:53.629 --> 21:55.663
They got me to mending
Last year's gowns.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.098
She's done
A wonderful job.

21:57.135 --> 21:59.601
What about this morning?

21:59.637 --> 22:01.337
Your vow of resistance?

22:01.406 --> 22:02.339
Oh.

22:02.408 --> 22:03.806
That was this morning.

22:03.843 --> 22:05.809
After careful
Consideration,

22:05.845 --> 22:08.847
We have decided the best way
To resist is in here.

22:08.916 --> 22:12.217
As papa says, we can all
Pretend a little, can't we?

22:12.253 --> 22:13.552
Absolutely not.

22:13.587 --> 22:16.757
In any event, I need belinda
Back in the kitchen.

22:16.791 --> 22:18.391
The apples are baked.

22:18.428 --> 22:20.528
For people who want
No part of the ball,

22:20.596 --> 22:24.333
Y'all sure got me doing
An awful lot of preparatin'.

22:24.368 --> 22:25.767
Apples?

22:25.803 --> 22:27.871
What apples?

22:27.940 --> 22:30.708
Never mind.

22:33.213 --> 22:35.479
The sage will do nicely.

22:51.736 --> 22:54.671
He's my third cousin
On my father's side.

22:56.409 --> 22:58.308
Shame about foster.

22:58.344 --> 23:00.545
Yes, I hear he's unwell.

23:00.580 --> 23:03.715
"unwell"?
The man has smallpox.

23:03.751 --> 23:05.250
You know as well as i,

23:05.319 --> 23:07.720
The statistics
Are not in his favor.

23:07.755 --> 23:09.856
He has a strong
Constitution.

23:09.891 --> 23:11.526
Have you seen him?

23:11.560 --> 23:14.563
No, he refuses to see anyone
For fear of infecting them.

23:15.766 --> 23:18.735
Typical.
Always playing the hero.

23:18.770 --> 23:20.370
Dr. Hale,
Are you jealous?

23:22.540 --> 23:24.575
Why? Need I be?

23:24.610 --> 23:29.348
Let's just say the statistics
Are in your favor.

23:29.383 --> 23:31.183
Now with your left.

23:31.219 --> 23:32.418
Your other left.

23:32.454 --> 23:33.886
Lieutenant mcgreevy,
If you can't tell

23:33.921 --> 23:35.556
Your lefts
From your rights,

23:35.591 --> 23:37.791
How can you tell
Your norths from your souths?

23:37.860 --> 23:39.361
My apologies, miss.

23:39.396 --> 23:42.398
We have all night
To make the distinction.

24:06.830 --> 24:08.297
Aurelia!

24:08.331 --> 24:09.764
What's happened,
Aurelia?!

24:09.800 --> 24:10.799
Leave me!

24:10.834 --> 24:12.468
What's happened?

24:12.503 --> 24:13.837
Leave me!

24:13.906 --> 24:15.271
No!

24:15.308 --> 24:16.907
I'll fetch a doctor.

24:16.942 --> 24:18.476
No!

24:18.512 --> 24:20.812
No one can find out.

24:20.848 --> 24:22.481
Promise me!

24:25.854 --> 24:26.820
And before the war?

24:26.855 --> 24:29.324
I spent a few years
On my brother's farm

24:29.359 --> 24:30.990
-in massachusetts.
-a country girl.

24:31.026 --> 24:33.962
Mansion house must have been
A rude awakening.
Oh, on the contrary.

24:33.996 --> 24:35.663
Corralling livestock
Turns out to have been

24:35.700 --> 24:37.165
Apt training
For tending to soldiers.

24:37.201 --> 24:38.835
-it should be compulsory.

24:44.878 --> 24:48.313
Gentlemen,
If you'll excuse me.

24:48.350 --> 24:49.482
Jimmy!

24:49.517 --> 24:51.385
Gentlemen,
I'd like you to meet my son.

24:51.454 --> 24:53.621
Jimmy,
This is colonel sinex,

24:53.656 --> 24:55.356
The provost marshal
Of alexandria.

24:55.390 --> 24:57.324
Very nice of you
To surrender your home

24:57.360 --> 24:58.693
For the evening,
Young man.

24:58.728 --> 25:00.495
And jimmy,
Lieutenant colonel connor here

25:00.530 --> 25:02.698
Is one of the youngest men
On either side

25:02.734 --> 25:04.867
To hold
Such an esteemed rank.
Well-deserved.

25:04.902 --> 25:07.537
Under fire, I hear
He's as brave as they come.

25:07.573 --> 25:09.807
Pleasure to meet you.

25:11.411 --> 25:12.478
Likewise.

25:12.513 --> 25:13.912
Colonel sinex: indeed.

25:13.981 --> 25:16.816
Always a pleasure to meet
A southern man of fighting age

25:16.851 --> 25:18.718
Who's not pointing
A rifle at us.

25:18.754 --> 25:20.387
-amen to that.

25:20.422 --> 25:22.356
So, where is
The lady of the house?

25:31.269 --> 25:33.737
Apples a la parisienne.

25:33.773 --> 25:36.541
Yes, my dears.

25:36.576 --> 25:39.545
That's the way we do it
In the south.

25:39.580 --> 25:42.247
We'll see how it tastes.

25:47.457 --> 25:49.589
You did the right thing
Coming to get me.

25:49.626 --> 25:50.792
Aurelia?

25:50.860 --> 25:52.695
You need to tell me
What happened.

25:52.730 --> 25:53.763
Aurelia?

25:53.798 --> 25:55.698
Oh, please.
Leave me be.

25:55.734 --> 25:56.933
She's been violated.

25:56.968 --> 25:59.704
What kind of monster
Would do such a thing?

25:59.739 --> 26:01.973
She did it to herself.

26:02.042 --> 26:04.608
She's been ingesting
Pennyroyal.

26:05.879 --> 26:08.947
Is she with child?

26:08.983 --> 26:11.283
Pennyroyal wouldn't cause
This much bleeding.

26:11.319 --> 26:14.287
I found a metal rod
On the floor.

26:14.323 --> 26:16.458
Dear god.

26:18.395 --> 26:20.463
Not the bravest soldier,

26:20.498 --> 26:21.930
But perhaps the wisest.

26:21.967 --> 26:24.802
What in god's name
Is this infernal concoction?

26:24.837 --> 26:26.970
Imperial
Raspberry whiskey punch.

26:27.004 --> 26:28.438
The punch
Is in the nose.

26:28.475 --> 26:29.940
I think someone
Stole the whiskey

26:29.976 --> 26:31.642
From the medical supply
Cabinet.

26:33.246 --> 26:35.281
Gentlemen, uh,
I have been harboring something

26:35.315 --> 26:37.183
For quite awhile now

26:37.252 --> 26:40.821
That I feel compelled
To share with you.

26:40.857 --> 26:42.657
It is rare, smooth,

26:42.692 --> 26:46.294
And aged for 18 years
In an oak cask.

26:46.330 --> 26:47.663
Kentucky whiskey.

26:47.699 --> 26:49.366
Is there
Any other kind?

26:49.435 --> 26:50.666
I have a secret cache

26:50.702 --> 26:52.802
That i'd prefer
To remain secret,

26:52.838 --> 26:55.372
So, if you'd care to join me
In private?

26:59.345 --> 27:00.979
Have some tumblers
Sent down

27:01.015 --> 27:03.316
And see
That we're not disturbed.

27:08.224 --> 27:09.457
She fainted.

27:09.493 --> 27:12.528
The packing's
Fully saturated.

27:12.564 --> 27:15.532
Her pulse is weakening.

27:15.566 --> 27:17.500
We need help.

27:20.506 --> 27:23.206
It's aurelia.
She's been injured.

27:23.243 --> 27:24.709
The laundress?

27:24.745 --> 27:27.513
She was bearing a child.
She tried to end it.

27:27.549 --> 27:29.850
-how far along was she?
-five, six weeks.

27:29.884 --> 27:32.620
I managed to remove the remains,
But the bleeding persisted.

27:32.655 --> 27:33.855
How did she do it?

27:33.890 --> 27:36.323
Samuel said
It was a metal rod.

27:36.359 --> 27:37.892
What are you doing?

27:37.961 --> 27:39.495
Coming to help.

27:39.529 --> 27:42.466
I came solely for advice.

27:42.500 --> 27:43.867
Very well.

27:43.901 --> 27:45.669
Without having seen
The patient,

27:45.704 --> 27:47.538
Judging only
From your description,

27:47.574 --> 27:49.341
I suspect
A cervical laceration,

27:49.375 --> 27:51.309
Which you'll need to close
Half-blind

27:51.345 --> 27:53.545
Given the limitations
Of access.

27:53.582 --> 27:56.382
Oh, and be aware
That the smallest error

27:56.418 --> 27:57.485
Might kill her.

27:57.520 --> 27:59.352
Good luck.

28:01.257 --> 28:02.591
Get dressed.

28:43.644 --> 28:45.745
For your own protection.

28:53.422 --> 28:57.225
Did you see him carrying on
With those bluebellies?

28:57.261 --> 28:58.795
I think he enjoys it.

28:58.829 --> 28:59.795
Oh.

28:59.831 --> 29:01.665
It may seem that way.

29:01.733 --> 29:02.967
"seem"?

29:03.001 --> 29:05.671
They got him
Wrapped around their fingers.

29:05.739 --> 29:07.906
He might as well
Drop the charade

29:07.942 --> 29:09.841
And put on
The union colors.

29:09.910 --> 29:12.477
What exactly
Are you saying?

29:12.512 --> 29:16.248
We must embrace reality,
Mother.

29:16.285 --> 29:18.452
Father is a traitor.

29:21.825 --> 29:23.659
You ungrateful child!

29:23.694 --> 29:26.362
A man's true duty
Is to protect his family,

29:26.431 --> 29:29.601
And that is precisely what
Your father is trying to do.

29:29.635 --> 29:33.336
Despite whatever criticisms
I may express,

29:33.372 --> 29:36.642
I am well aware of that
At all times.

29:36.676 --> 29:40.613
I see so much of him
In you, jimmy.

29:40.649 --> 29:42.816
His eyes, his smile.

29:42.851 --> 29:46.622
Perhaps one day,
You'll even have his character.

29:46.656 --> 29:49.525
If you ever grow up.

29:57.670 --> 30:00.872
Kentucky whiskey.
You are a most gracious host.

30:00.907 --> 30:04.243
I wish I could say it was
Out of the kindness of my heart.

30:04.311 --> 30:07.714
There is a small personal matter
I'd like to discuss,

30:07.750 --> 30:11.018
And I figured a little
Buttering up wouldn't hurt.

30:11.054 --> 30:13.587
There is an administrator
In your command.

30:13.657 --> 30:15.490
Captain harkins
Is his name.

30:15.526 --> 30:18.261
He has presented me
With an oath,

30:18.328 --> 30:20.930
And he has threatened
To prosecute

30:20.999 --> 30:22.833
If I refuse to sign it.

30:22.868 --> 30:26.038
As the provost marshal,
You could grant me a reprieve.

30:26.072 --> 30:28.439
The oath
Is a matter of allegiance.

30:28.508 --> 30:31.911
My hotel is now a hospital
Mending your soldiers.

30:31.946 --> 30:33.881
The ones who can't be saved

30:33.915 --> 30:37.351
Are buried in coffins
Produced in my factory.

30:37.386 --> 30:40.722
I have given everything
To your war effort,

30:40.758 --> 30:45.861
But my allegiance
Is to my family.

30:45.897 --> 30:48.799
A signature
On a piece of paper will cause

30:48.867 --> 30:51.267
Considerable difficulty for us
In this community.

30:51.304 --> 30:52.870
How so?

30:52.906 --> 30:56.076
Nearly everyone in alexandria
Has already signed the oath.

30:56.110 --> 30:58.611
Or they've been run out
Or will be soon.

30:58.646 --> 31:01.749
In other words, this community
Is no longer confederate.

31:01.784 --> 31:03.483
Exactly.

31:03.552 --> 31:07.956
All i'm asking
Is a bit more time...

31:07.991 --> 31:13.329
To allow my wife, my children
To adjust to the idea of it.

31:13.397 --> 31:14.932
How much time?

31:14.967 --> 31:16.466
Six months.

31:16.501 --> 31:18.970
Ha! The war
Will be over by then.

31:19.005 --> 31:22.474
From your lips
To god's ears, colonel.

31:22.509 --> 31:23.643
Hear, hear.

31:23.677 --> 31:26.347
She's distended.

31:26.381 --> 31:29.015
Blood is accumulating
In her abdomen.

31:29.051 --> 31:32.220
She's perforated the uterine
Wall on the left side.

31:32.288 --> 31:33.821
Did she cut a vein?

31:33.858 --> 31:34.856
An artery.

31:34.892 --> 31:36.625
-what can be done?
-nothing.

31:36.660 --> 31:37.861
It's too deep.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.963
We're just gonna let her
Bleed to death?

31:39.998 --> 31:41.798
Explain
To our colored friend here

31:41.834 --> 31:44.035
That attempting to suture
A wound I cannot see

31:44.070 --> 31:45.536
Is fool's errand.

31:57.921 --> 31:59.922
I am deeply sorry,
Samuel.

32:13.608 --> 32:14.906
Aurelia.

32:14.942 --> 32:19.279
Julius caesar's mother's name --
Aurelia.

32:19.347 --> 32:22.016
Caesar was delivered
By caesarian birth.

32:22.051 --> 32:24.419
Or so the mythology says.

32:24.454 --> 32:27.890
We could perform
A caesarian procedure.

32:27.926 --> 32:29.458
There is no baby to deliver.

32:29.527 --> 32:31.728
No, but we could use
The ritgen approach.

32:31.762 --> 32:33.763
I observed it once
While in berlin.

32:33.800 --> 32:35.733
Or was it rutgen?

32:35.768 --> 32:37.568
Not a tall man.

32:39.372 --> 32:41.440
He introduced
An abdominal incision

32:41.474 --> 32:43.809
To gain subperitoneal access
To the uterus,

32:43.879 --> 32:46.446
From which we could repair
The perforation.

32:46.481 --> 32:47.548
-cut her open?
-yes.

32:47.582 --> 32:48.816
-she'll die.
-most likely.

32:48.852 --> 32:51.486
Of course, if we do nothing,
She'll be dead within the hour.

32:51.554 --> 32:52.888
As you said,

32:52.923 --> 32:55.959
I'm in no condition
To consult on medical matters.

32:55.994 --> 32:57.626
So I leave it to you.

32:57.662 --> 32:59.063
Then I say no.

32:59.098 --> 33:01.131
I'll say yes.

33:01.167 --> 33:03.834
Yeah, i've seen you work,
Dr. Foster.

33:03.903 --> 33:05.635
If anyone can save her,
You can.

33:31.037 --> 33:33.372
Hm.

33:42.786 --> 33:45.120
Hm.

33:48.826 --> 33:50.793
I'm still
A tad unsteady.

33:50.829 --> 33:53.363
That smallpox
Give you the shakes?

33:53.400 --> 33:55.366
I never heard of that
Being a symptom.

33:55.401 --> 33:59.038
Aside from that, I must say,
I've made a remarkable recovery.

33:59.073 --> 34:02.042
Don't worry.
I'll guide you.

34:07.550 --> 34:09.417
Samuel has experience.

34:09.485 --> 34:10.885
Where? On a farm?

34:10.920 --> 34:13.522
Horses and cows
Are not human beings.

34:13.556 --> 34:15.690
Dr. Lionel berenson
Of philadelphia.

34:15.725 --> 34:17.561
I spent 10 years
At his side.

34:17.594 --> 34:18.395
You apprenticed?

34:18.429 --> 34:19.696
It was not so official.

34:19.731 --> 34:21.898
He would take me out
On calls with him.

34:21.935 --> 34:23.900
I can attest to his being
More knowledgeable

34:23.938 --> 34:25.670
Than half the physicians
In this hospital.

34:25.706 --> 34:27.505
That's not saying much.

34:30.779 --> 34:32.713
There's a laceration
Of the artery

34:32.748 --> 34:34.947
In the uterine wall
On the upper left side.

34:35.016 --> 34:36.917
Where would you incise?

34:36.953 --> 34:38.920
Here. Low and lateral.

34:38.956 --> 34:44.061
Shouldn't need but 6 inches
Since no baby needs to come out.

34:45.764 --> 34:49.368
Very well, dr. Berenson's
Unofficial apprentice.

34:49.402 --> 34:50.803
Proceed.

34:54.743 --> 34:56.043
What was that

34:56.078 --> 34:57.110
Go check.

35:22.610 --> 35:24.945
Miss phinney,
We need the light!

35:50.112 --> 35:52.880
Uh, oh, my apologies,
Miss green.

35:52.949 --> 35:54.849
-you'll have to excuse us.
-so early?

35:54.884 --> 35:56.785
You're just getting
The hang of it.

35:56.820 --> 35:59.555
Much as your charity
Is appreciated --

35:59.623 --> 36:01.658
We're due back
At our post.

36:02.728 --> 36:04.895
Our boys
Are off fighting your boys,

36:04.964 --> 36:07.465
And you're gonna
Leave us here? Alone?

36:07.500 --> 36:11.069
Surely, one more dance won't
Affect the outcome of the war.

36:11.138 --> 36:16.843
I suppose one more dance
Wouldn't hurt.

36:45.781 --> 36:49.083
How did you come into
The employment of dr. Berenson?

36:49.120 --> 36:52.055
My mother
Is the doctor's maid.

36:52.089 --> 36:55.124
My father
Was his liveryman.

36:55.193 --> 36:56.926
I grew up in the house.

36:56.962 --> 36:58.462
The rectus muscle.

36:58.531 --> 37:00.431
You'll need to dissect it
From the peritoneum.

37:00.467 --> 37:02.700
Take care
Not to injure the vessels.

37:02.736 --> 37:04.937
Don't go inventing
More difficulties

37:04.972 --> 37:06.473
Than we have already.

37:06.542 --> 37:08.741
You're doing
A fine job, samuel.

37:11.113 --> 37:12.581
Why mansion house?

37:12.616 --> 37:13.582
Sir?

37:13.617 --> 37:15.485
Why did you come here?

37:15.552 --> 37:18.086
To gain practical experience,
To learn.

37:18.121 --> 37:22.625
All right, now,
Push the bladder downward.

37:22.662 --> 37:23.894
Gently!

37:23.929 --> 37:27.799
This is where
Ritgen's patient expired.

37:28.935 --> 37:30.636
Or was it rutgen?

37:30.672 --> 37:33.807
The procedure
Was not successful?

37:33.842 --> 37:35.476
Not for the patient.

37:35.511 --> 37:38.446
Have you considered
Formal medical training?

37:38.482 --> 37:40.481
Um...

37:40.517 --> 37:41.816
Not much.

37:41.851 --> 37:43.985
I hear of certain colleges
Accepting negroes

37:44.021 --> 37:45.955
With solid recommendations.

37:45.990 --> 37:47.758
There it is.

37:47.792 --> 37:49.959
The uterine wall.

37:49.995 --> 37:51.996
Do you see
The perforated artery?

37:52.065 --> 37:53.997
Um...

37:54.067 --> 37:55.133
Yes, sir.

37:55.168 --> 37:56.635
It'll need a ligature.

37:56.671 --> 37:58.471
Miss phinney,
You have some expertise

37:58.506 --> 38:00.407
With that procedure,
If I recall.

38:04.348 --> 38:05.747
As I suspected.

38:05.781 --> 38:08.750
You familiar
With a tenaculum?

38:08.785 --> 38:09.751
Yes, sir.

38:09.787 --> 38:10.953
You heard the man.

38:10.988 --> 38:13.457
Silk sutures
And a tenaculum.

38:19.700 --> 38:21.333
Careful.

38:21.369 --> 38:25.372
So much as a pinprick,
And she dies of peritonitis.

38:27.676 --> 38:29.610
I could write you one.

38:29.646 --> 38:30.844
One what, sir?

38:30.880 --> 38:32.480
A recommendation.

38:32.515 --> 38:34.048
When the war ends,

38:34.117 --> 38:37.520
There will be free colored folks
Looking for good physicians.

38:37.555 --> 38:38.721
-dr. Foster?
-yes?

38:38.791 --> 38:40.857
Do you think
We could discuss this later?

38:40.893 --> 38:42.359
I'm trying to concentrate.

38:42.396 --> 38:43.361
Oh.

38:43.397 --> 38:44.962
Naturally.

38:44.998 --> 38:46.798
Of course.

38:57.547 --> 39:00.015
-oh!
-oh, my!

39:00.050 --> 39:01.717
Get your hands
Off my sister!

39:01.753 --> 39:02.884
Watcyourself, son!

39:02.921 --> 39:04.053
-or what?
-jimmy!

39:04.088 --> 39:05.054
Frank's off fighting,

39:05.089 --> 39:06.757
And you're dancing
With the enemy!

39:06.826 --> 39:08.492
We're only being cordial, jimmy.
It's harmless.

39:08.528 --> 39:10.228
I wonder if tom thinks
It's harmless.

39:10.262 --> 39:11.229
Let's take this outside.

39:11.264 --> 39:12.497
What's wrong
With right here?

39:12.532 --> 39:14.999
Don't mind my brother.
He's had too much to drink.

39:15.035 --> 39:17.169
Hell he has!
You're making
A fool of yourself!

39:17.204 --> 39:18.904
I'm standing up
To these blue devils!

39:18.940 --> 39:21.608
About time somebody did!
Shh!
If you keep this up,

39:21.677 --> 39:24.111
You're gonna ruin
The whole plan.
Plan? What plan?

39:36.028 --> 39:37.126
Tom!

39:41.935 --> 39:44.103
Hey, frank.

39:44.137 --> 39:46.940
What the hell
Are you doing?

39:46.975 --> 39:49.778
Get your boots on.

39:51.815 --> 39:54.984
You're supposed to be ready.
We said 9:00.

39:55.052 --> 39:56.419
Sorry.

39:57.989 --> 40:00.222
Guess I forgot.

40:01.093 --> 40:02.960
Forget how to tie 'em, too?

40:02.995 --> 40:06.130
Gonna have to change
Our plan.

40:06.166 --> 40:10.636
Upstairs wasn't as empty
As I figured

40:10.672 --> 40:14.308
Gonna have to find
Another way out.

40:18.282 --> 40:21.316
You haven't forgot
How to use this.

40:21.351 --> 40:22.952
Have you?

40:22.986 --> 40:26.990
Don't worry.
I remember.

40:27.025 --> 40:29.860
Let's go.

40:35.703 --> 40:38.371
It's sealed shut.

40:40.208 --> 40:43.211
Come on.
Let's try the water closet.

40:51.222 --> 40:52.689
Keep it down!

40:52.725 --> 40:55.292
Think you can do better?

40:57.898 --> 41:01.869
Hey, in there,
What's with all the noise?

41:04.173 --> 41:06.675
Uh...

41:06.709 --> 41:07.842
My apologies.

41:07.877 --> 41:09.844
Just...

41:09.880 --> 41:12.246
Trying to do my business
In the dark here.

41:13.417 --> 41:15.317
Identify yourself.

41:15.353 --> 41:16.720
Private ben...

41:16.755 --> 41:17.855
Franklin.

41:19.726 --> 41:23.561
3rd regiment,
Uh, ohio volunteers.

41:23.598 --> 41:24.597
Ohio?

41:24.665 --> 41:25.731
That's right.

41:25.766 --> 41:27.600
Need me to send
For a nurse?

41:27.669 --> 41:31.771
No, sir, just a bad case
Of the quick step.

41:31.840 --> 41:34.340
Peace and quiet
Wouldn't hurt.

41:34.377 --> 41:37.546
Never could talk and shoot
At the same time.

41:37.581 --> 41:39.681
Good night, ohio.

41:39.718 --> 41:41.450
Same to you.

41:43.855 --> 41:45.422
"ben franklin"?

41:45.458 --> 41:48.627
Want to do the talking
Next time, be my guest.

42:07.151 --> 42:08.618
Halt!

42:08.654 --> 42:10.286
What kind of pals
Are you?

42:10.322 --> 42:12.289
I got to find out
From my sister?

42:12.324 --> 42:13.624
Jimmy, quiet!

42:13.661 --> 42:16.161
You've been back for days
And never said a word,

42:16.229 --> 42:17.729
And on top of it --

42:18.165 --> 42:19.798
Is that my shirt
You got on?

42:19.833 --> 42:21.500
Quiet!
You'll get us all shot!

42:21.570 --> 42:23.469
-i'm coming with you.
-the hell you are.

42:23.505 --> 42:26.807
I stole this uniform.
I can get us through the lines.
Put that down!

42:26.843 --> 42:29.477
You couldn't get us through
The front door of a barn.

42:29.512 --> 42:30.812
-you're wallpapered!
-am not.

42:30.848 --> 42:32.281
Go home, jimmy.

42:32.316 --> 42:33.483
I'm never going home.

42:34.586 --> 42:35.819
You can't come with us.

42:37.190 --> 42:38.456
We only got two horses.

42:38.491 --> 42:39.824
I'll run alongside!

42:39.859 --> 42:42.594
I'm tired of people telling me
What I can't do!

42:42.629 --> 42:44.495
Please, frank.

42:44.531 --> 42:46.498
It'll be like
When we were kids,

42:46.534 --> 42:49.335
The three of us,
On an adventure.

42:49.370 --> 42:52.206
"brothers always,
Never surrender."

42:52.274 --> 42:54.141
Did you forget?

42:54.177 --> 42:57.847
All right.
You can ride with me.

42:57.882 --> 43:00.283
You won't regret it.

43:04.957 --> 43:07.158
He never could
Hold his liquor.

43:07.192 --> 43:08.326
Let's go.

43:10.731 --> 43:12.665
Hyah! Hyah!

43:28.687 --> 43:30.720
It's finished.

43:30.757 --> 43:34.359
You've done a fine job,
Samuel.

43:34.393 --> 43:37.228
You're a fine teacher, sir.

43:37.265 --> 43:40.232
Pyemia is a danger.

43:40.268 --> 43:43.203
The loss of blood,
All this cutting...

43:43.239 --> 43:46.507
A local application
Of permanganate of potassa

43:46.543 --> 43:47.743
Is advisable.

43:47.779 --> 43:51.280
But I wouldn't
Get my hopes up.

43:51.348 --> 43:52.748
She's strong.

43:52.784 --> 43:56.386
There will be
A lot of pain to endure.

43:56.422 --> 44:00.257
She'll need some relief
To get through it.

44:02.763 --> 44:04.564
Was it yours?

44:04.598 --> 44:06.566
The baby?

44:20.885 --> 44:22.753
Thank you,
Miss phinney.

44:27.161 --> 44:28.761
Every four hours.

44:28.796 --> 44:31.464
A little more
If pain persists,

44:31.499 --> 44:33.133
But not much more.

44:33.168 --> 44:35.669
It can be hard to shake.

44:38.474 --> 44:40.608
Do you have experience
With injection?

44:40.644 --> 44:41.744
No, sir.

44:41.779 --> 44:44.647
I'll show you how.

44:51.357 --> 44:53.491
Steady the arm,
Inject it into a muscle.

44:53.526 --> 44:55.862
Miss phinney's seen it done.
She can assist.

44:55.930 --> 44:57.196
I'll be in my room.

45:12.183 --> 45:14.218
Provost marshal
Has consented.

45:14.287 --> 45:15.352
Consented to what?

45:15.387 --> 45:16.855
I said I had a plan.

45:16.890 --> 45:19.692
I've put this oath business
To rest for good.

45:19.726 --> 45:23.395
Then we've each served
The cause.

45:23.463 --> 45:25.665
See that white cake?

45:29.638 --> 45:32.173
See the other?

45:32.209 --> 45:35.143
Your apples
A la parisienne?

45:35.180 --> 45:36.344
Mm-hmm.

45:36.380 --> 45:39.416
Apparently,
Even yanks have palates.

45:42.488 --> 45:46.657
That dessert signifies
A victory for dixie.

46:11.790 --> 46:13.893
That's far as I go.

46:13.927 --> 46:16.462
I was hoping
You'd be coming along.

46:16.529 --> 46:18.899
Oh, they got bigger plans
For me here, tom.

46:18.934 --> 46:21.602
You're gonna ride southwest
To elks horn run.

46:21.636 --> 46:23.238
Our old fishing spot.

46:23.273 --> 46:25.440
Well, don't stop
To catch nothin'.

46:25.475 --> 46:26.441
River's shallow there.

46:26.477 --> 46:28.411
Shouldn't even have to get
Your socks wet.

46:28.445 --> 46:30.881
Two men will meet you
On the other side,

46:30.917 --> 46:32.547
Get you to your regiment.

46:32.584 --> 46:35.419
You'll be back in the fight
Before you know it.

46:37.390 --> 46:41.794
My stirrup strap's cracked.
Can't ride him like this.

46:49.806 --> 46:52.275
What happened to me?

46:52.310 --> 46:54.476
We saved your life.

46:54.513 --> 46:56.512
Dr. Foster and me.

46:58.951 --> 47:00.483
That's been settled.

47:00.519 --> 47:02.953
You don't have to worry
About that no more.

47:02.989 --> 47:06.658
All you need
To worry about is...

47:06.693 --> 47:10.463
Getting better, stronger.

47:13.669 --> 47:16.638
I got a hankering for you,
Aurelia.

47:16.673 --> 47:20.375
Nothing that's happened
Is gonna change that.

47:23.714 --> 47:25.714
But there's something else.

47:25.783 --> 47:27.217
The operation...

47:27.286 --> 47:29.821
Things had to be done.

47:29.856 --> 47:32.657
We had to mend a wound.

47:32.693 --> 47:38.898
If it were to open again,
You could surely bleed to death.

47:42.839 --> 47:45.674
You won't be able to bear
A child.

47:50.815 --> 47:54.185
I already got one.

47:54.220 --> 47:57.755
A little boy.

47:57.824 --> 48:00.893
Gabriel.

48:03.232 --> 48:06.232
He on roanoke island.

48:06.268 --> 48:09.737
But he coming to meet me.

48:09.772 --> 48:13.275
I was only waiting
Till he get here.

48:16.447 --> 48:19.250
She is well for now,
At least.

48:19.284 --> 48:21.719
Thought
You'd want to know.

48:21.755 --> 48:23.688
Wait.

48:32.467 --> 48:36.370
You left the supply closet
Unlocked.

48:39.577 --> 48:41.911
You'll find every drop present
And accounted for.

48:44.750 --> 48:48.954
As they say in africa,
Darkness hides the hippopotamus.

48:54.328 --> 48:56.263
Miss phinney.

49:03.440 --> 49:06.475
I must apologize.

49:06.511 --> 49:09.980
For my behavior earlier.

49:10.015 --> 49:12.184
The things I said.

49:16.323 --> 49:18.991
I did
Everything I could...

49:19.025 --> 49:22.161
To nurse my husband
Back to health.

49:22.198 --> 49:26.634
But in the end,
It wasn't enough.

49:26.669 --> 49:30.038
And most days here
Feel the same...

49:30.108 --> 49:33.977
As if nothing
Is ever enough.

49:36.616 --> 49:38.648
But not today.

49:41.121 --> 49:43.722
Today, we did enough.

49:51.033 --> 49:53.201
Be the master
Of your own fate.

50:17.600 --> 50:21.403
Remember when we broke into
The opperman place?

50:21.438 --> 50:24.906
Tried to make off
With that block of ice?

50:24.941 --> 50:29.079
I remember old opperman
Locking me in that freezer box

50:29.113 --> 50:31.682
Between tail whuppin's.

50:33.554 --> 50:35.220
You never gave me up.

50:35.255 --> 50:39.258
You've been as good of a friend
As anyone could ask for,

50:39.295 --> 50:40.627
Since we were kids.

50:40.696 --> 50:44.699
You ain't about to kiss me now,
Are you, tom?

50:46.703 --> 50:49.137
I just wanted you to know
I'm sorry.

50:54.313 --> 50:55.278
Sorry for what?

50:59.752 --> 51:03.054
I can't, frank.

51:03.091 --> 51:05.291
The blood, the smoke.

51:05.327 --> 51:08.128
The screaming you never know
Where it's coming from,

51:08.163 --> 51:12.601
The eyes in the darkness
Looking out at you.

51:15.240 --> 51:17.505
I can't go back.

51:17.575 --> 51:20.410
What are you saying?

51:20.446 --> 51:21.478
Tom?

51:21.513 --> 51:23.581
Tell alice
That I love her.
