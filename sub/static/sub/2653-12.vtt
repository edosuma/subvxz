WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:03.776
Okay, everybody, cake time.

00:03.838 --> 00:05.476
Thank God. I really have to study.

00:05.539 --> 00:08.315
Oh, sweetheart, can't you just take
a minute to enjoy it? it's your birthday.

00:08.376 --> 00:09.878
You put too much pressure on yourself.

00:09.943 --> 00:12.754
I remember my sweet 16.
I wanted a theme party.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.793
Moonstruck. had just come out,
but I hadn't, so-

00:14.849 --> 00:17.295
No stories. No time. S.A.T.'s.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.989
Here we go, everybody.

00:19.053 --> 00:20.123
- ♪ Ha- ♪
- Wait, wait.

00:20.187 --> 00:21.962
We all know why we're here.

00:22.023 --> 00:23.832
- Ay. honey, you missed one-
- I know!

00:23.891 --> 00:27.236
- I know I missed one! I'm not an idiot!
- Whoa.

00:27.294 --> 00:28.500
There! Happy?

00:28.562 --> 00:30.667
- Whoa. You're being a little-
- Obstreperous?

00:30.731 --> 00:32.438
Recalcitrant? Truculent?

00:32.500 --> 00:34.673
- I was gonna say cray cray.
- Alex, sweet pea-

00:34.735 --> 00:37.045
I really need to focus.

00:37.104 --> 00:38.981
There is a 16-year-old science prodigy...

00:39.040 --> 00:41.145
studying cancer research
at Johns Hopkins.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.518
Sixteen! What am I doing?
I'm eating cake!

00:43.577 --> 00:44.647
No, no, no.

00:44.712 --> 00:47.352
Cake! Cake! Cake!

00:47.415 --> 00:49.292
♪ Hey, hey♪

00:49.350 --> 00:51.387
♪ Hey, hey♪

00:51.452 --> 00:53.489
♪ Hey, hey♪

00:53.554 --> 00:55.465
♪ Hey, hey♪

00:55.523 --> 00:56.695
♪ Hey,♪♪

00:59.226 --> 01:01.968
Alex might be a little bit fragile
after last night...

01:02.029 --> 01:03.565
so let's try to be sensitive.

01:03.631 --> 01:06.840
Oh, believe me, I am going to be
nothing but nice to Alex from now on.

01:06.901 --> 01:09.745
If she snaps and goes on a rampage,
who do you think she's coming for first?

01:09.804 --> 01:11.613
She's not going on a rampage.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.276
I bet she'd let me live. She likes me.

01:13.340 --> 01:14.978
I'm just gonna say it-
I never trusted her.

01:15.042 --> 01:16.385
All right. Everybody just be normal.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.549
We're gonna treat her
exactly the way we usually do.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.558
And there she is!

01:20.614 --> 01:21.957
- Hi, pretty girl.
- How'd you sleep?

01:22.016 --> 01:24.257
- Fine.
- Your hair looks super soft, Al.

01:24.318 --> 01:26.059
And is that a great new sweater?

01:26.120 --> 01:27.622
Love.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.634
- Dad, can you hand me the butter knife?
- No!

01:29.690 --> 01:31.033
Haley, Luke, upstairs, please.

01:31.092 --> 01:32.594
Thank you.

01:34.795 --> 01:36.206
Thanks.

01:36.263 --> 01:37.833
So, about my meltdown-

01:37.898 --> 01:39.036
- Who?
- What meltdown?

01:39.100 --> 01:41.137
I want to see a therapist.
I did some research.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.113
Dr. Gregory Clark- highly recommended...

01:43.170 --> 01:45.514
specializes in teenagers
and is covered by our insurance.

01:45.573 --> 01:47.519
I booked a double session
with him today...

01:47.575 --> 01:51.045
and since you guys have the open house,
I will be taking the bus.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.551
- Okay.
- That sounds good.

01:55.683 --> 01:57.754
She's like a self-cleaning oven.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.320
- Hey!
- Hey.

01:59.386 --> 02:02.595
Check it out. I'm rockin' the old school
for the open house today.

02:02.656 --> 02:06.331
- I'm gonna put the "fizz" back in "phys ed."
- I love it- all of it.

02:06.393 --> 02:08.497
Really? 'Cause I want to make
a good impression today.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.564
I want to be the teacher
all the parents are talking about.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.804
- Well, that explains the socks.
- What?

02:12.867 --> 02:14.437
There's a caste system at school-

02:14.502 --> 02:17.847
academic teachers at the top,
gym teachers at the bottom.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.748
It's offensive and disrespectful.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.912
They treat us like we're lunch ladies.

02:21.976 --> 02:23.455
Hey there, neighbor.

02:23.511 --> 02:26.253
- Oh, hey. it's Asher, right?
- Yeah.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.690
Um, I just wanted to let you know-

02:27.748 --> 02:29.591
I think there might be something wrong
with your air conditioner.

02:29.650 --> 02:30.856
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.420
It just seems to be running a lot...

02:32.486 --> 02:33.965
even when it's, uh,
kind of cool outside.

02:34.021 --> 02:35.523
Oh. No, no.

02:35.589 --> 02:37.193
My partner runs a little hot.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.931
Not as hot as our planet.

02:38.993 --> 02:40.802
Sorry. I don't mean to be that guy.

02:40.861 --> 02:43.068
It's just, um, we're all in this together.

02:43.130 --> 02:44.768
Yeah. I drive a Prius, so-

02:44.832 --> 02:46.436
And that's a nice little gesture.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.104
My car runs on reclaimed cooking oil.

02:48.169 --> 02:50.945
- I have some literature, if you want it.
- That's okay. Save the paper.

02:51.005 --> 02:53.713
I haven't printed anything since 2004.
I was gonna e-mail you.

02:53.774 --> 02:56.414
- On your power-hungry computer?
- My entire house is solar-powered.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.980
I sell energy back to the grid
and use that money to save polar bears.

02:59.046 --> 03:03.552
- I'm an environmental lawyer, so I'm pretty green.
- Mmm. So is your lawn.

03:05.386 --> 03:08.333
I went drought-tolerant-
succulents, indigenous plants, rock garden.

03:08.389 --> 03:12.269
My other daddy says your yard
looks like a litter box.

03:12.326 --> 03:13.930
She's a cute kid.

03:13.994 --> 03:16.406
I remember when she was
in disposable diapers.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.407
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

03:22.469 --> 03:25.245
Why do you look like that
when I look like this?

03:25.306 --> 03:27.047
My friends say
it's because of your money.

03:27.107 --> 03:30.020
No, I'm just saying, why is she
all dressed up for a school open house?

03:30.077 --> 03:32.387
I want to impress
Manny's history teacher.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.187
I want Manny to go to Washington, D.C.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.426
Yeah, Junior Congress.

03:36.483 --> 03:38.827
Only one kid in the whole grade
gets picked to go.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.331
I think I can make a difference.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.333
Regular Congress
can't even make a difference.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.732
Don't worry, Manny. I have it covered.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.793
You just go and enjoy your date.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.896
I have a date. it's no big deal.

03:47.962 --> 03:50.306
- Don't make a thing about it.
- What did I do with my car keys?

03:50.364 --> 03:52.537
I mean, we're just friends now,
but I have a good feeling.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.444
- I know. Don't get ahead of myself.
- Every time I put them down.

03:55.502 --> 03:57.140
- What is her name?
- Either Zoe or Piper.

03:57.204 --> 03:59.616
How can you be going on a date
and you don't know her name?

03:59.673 --> 04:01.175
This is where it gets interesting.

04:01.242 --> 04:02.983
I seriously doubt that.

04:03.043 --> 04:06.183
A few days ago,
we almost let a girl come between us.

04:08.315 --> 04:09.885
- Who is she?
- The new girl.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.453
- She's pretty.
- Super pretty.

04:12.519 --> 04:14.521
- Dibs.
- What? N-No.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.797
You can't call dibs. She's a human being
with feelings, not the front seat.

04:17.858 --> 04:20.134
Then a miracle happened

04:20.194 --> 04:22.868
Twins, each as pretty as the other.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.435
It's funny. Luke and I
don't usually go for the same kind of girl.

04:27.501 --> 04:31.381
Yeah. I like to describe my type
as "get-able."

04:33.874 --> 04:35.979
What are you doing, Tucker?

04:36.043 --> 04:37.852
Oh, hey, Principal Brown.

04:37.911 --> 04:41.859
Do you know how other teachers drone on
and on to parents with their boring lectures?

04:41.915 --> 04:44.361
Well, I thought I would go another way.

04:44.418 --> 04:47.331
- Oh. Well, I don't like the sound of that at all.
- I think you will.

04:47.388 --> 04:50.494
I'm gonna spice things up
with a spirited game of dodgeball.

04:50.557 --> 04:52.093
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

04:52.159 --> 04:54.332
- Okay, before you say no-
- I already said "no."

04:54.395 --> 04:56.306
- let me show you my whole bit.
- Uh-huh.

04:56.363 --> 04:58.969
Howdy, folks. My name's Tucker.

04:59.033 --> 05:01.741
I'm the sheriff of dodge... ball.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.679
- Oh.
- Laugh, laugh, laugh.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.944
- And then-
- No. No "then." No.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.849
Have you seen the shape
some of these folks are in?

05:07.908 --> 05:09.683
We don't need a parent
dropping dead in here.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.313
Look, this is the Dolphin Den.

05:11.378 --> 05:14.450
I am not renaming it
the Harvey K. Mandelbaum Memorial Gym.

05:14.515 --> 05:17.394
But I was gonna divide everybody up
into the Hatfield and McCoys.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.055
Just- No dodgeball!

05:22.489 --> 05:26.198
Hello, Mr. Ingram. I am
Gloria Delgado-Pritchett, Manny's mother.

05:26.260 --> 05:28.934
- Yes, of course.
- I just wanted to thank you so much.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.805
He thinks the world of you.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.969
You know, as a child of an immigrant...

05:33.033 --> 05:36.480
he can look at the world
with such a fresh perspective.

05:36.537 --> 05:39.643
And talking about fresh,
I brought you some empanadas.

05:39.707 --> 05:40.879
Subtle.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.416
Hey, Phil. Where's Claire?

05:43.477 --> 05:45.650
Oh, she's going to Alex's classes.
I'm doing Luke's.

05:45.713 --> 05:49.320
- I'm surprised to see you here. Isn't your team playing today?
- Yeah. Gloria made me come.

05:49.383 --> 05:52.421
I think I'm recording the game,
but you can never know.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.432
The last time, I got six hours of Bravo.

05:54.488 --> 05:55.990
And who knows?

05:56.056 --> 05:59.936
Maybe Manny's going to be the first Latino president.

05:59.993 --> 06:04.533
Hello, Mr. Ingram.
Dr. Donna Duncan, Wesley's mom.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.600
Just brought you a little thank-you...

06:06.667 --> 06:09.170
for being his absolute
favorite teacher ever.

06:09.236 --> 06:11.682
- Those cupcakes are so white.
- Thank you.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.412
Dr. Donna Duncan.

06:13.474 --> 06:15.920
I'm Gloria. We've met several times.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.819
Oh, of course.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.415
- Mario's mom.
- Manny.

06:20.481 --> 06:25.123
And how is he fitting in now?
Better? Anyway-

06:25.185 --> 06:27.324
Here she is.

06:28.389 --> 06:30.266
You brought a flask to an open house?

06:30.324 --> 06:32.668
- You want some? it's scotch.
- No. Put it away.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.569
Don't be such a goody-goody. Taste it.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.301
- It's older than you are.
- I don't want any scotch.

06:36.363 --> 06:39.037
- Well, just smell it.
- Fine.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.045
Mr. Dunphy, is that a flask?

06:41.101 --> 06:42.603
No. it is.

06:42.669 --> 06:44.979
- I was- it's his.
- No, it's not.

06:45.038 --> 06:48.815
For the record, no alcohol is allowed
on school premises.

06:48.876 --> 06:52.346
For God's sake, Phil,
it's 2:00 in the afternoon.

06:57.184 --> 07:01.155
So, Alex, tell me why you're here.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.624
I had a little meltdown last night...

07:03.690 --> 07:05.533
and I'm afraid it'll happen again...

07:05.592 --> 07:07.731
but this time in the middle
of the S.A.T.'s or something.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.502
Why do you think you melted down?

07:09.563 --> 07:12.772
I'm stressed. it's my junior year.

07:12.833 --> 07:15.643
Part of me feels like the limbic system
in my brain's a bit off.

07:15.702 --> 07:17.477
That's a thing, right?
I did some research.

07:17.538 --> 07:20.644
You know I charge the same
even if you diagnose yourself?

07:20.707 --> 07:23.051
I'm just trying to move this along.
I have a lot to do.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.181
Well, uh, this is a process.

07:25.245 --> 07:26.849
You know, it takes some time.

07:26.914 --> 07:29.360
What- What are you thinking?

07:29.416 --> 07:31.692
- Nothing.
- No, no. Go ahead. Tell me.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.425
That maybe you're not up for this.

07:33.487 --> 07:36.934
I mean, no offense. You're just a lot older
than you look on your Web site.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.630
- Oh. - Did you even have S.A.T.'s
when you were in high school?

07:39.693 --> 07:41.400
- Or Asian kids?
- Oh, no.

07:41.462 --> 07:44.409
No, no, no. But there were other things
I worried about-

07:44.465 --> 07:47.639
Spanish inquisition,
sailing off the edge of the world...

07:47.701 --> 07:49.578
learning how to understand fire.

07:49.636 --> 07:52.082
- Sorry.
- You mind if we try something?

07:52.139 --> 07:54.710
- What?
- Just do me a favor.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.277
Take a deep breath.

08:00.113 --> 08:03.060
Great. Now, what's on your mind?

08:04.184 --> 08:06.528
Well-

08:06.587 --> 08:09.329
I just remembered that I forgot
to charge my computer before I left...

08:09.389 --> 08:11.494
and that I have to get
new index cards before Monday.

08:11.558 --> 08:13.060
Hopefully they don't
run out of the blue ones...

08:13.126 --> 08:14.867
because for some reason,
those help me study better.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.272
Maybe it's because they're easier to read
or maybe my prescription's getting worse.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.106
I should probably make an appointment
with the eye doctor.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.668
Also, should I get a job this summer...

08:20.734 --> 08:22.543
or would an internship
look better on my application?

08:22.603 --> 08:25.607
And what is up with Hillary?
Is she going to run or not?

08:25.672 --> 08:28.516
I mean, I feel like she'd totally understand
the feeling of being overwhelmed...

08:28.575 --> 08:31.920
but also like you're not
doing enough at the same time.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.457
Wow.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.961
- Hey, Nina, how's Sanjay?
- Oh, great. Thanks.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.294
He's just dealing with the S.A.T.'s
and the A.C.T.'s...

08:41.355 --> 08:43.732
and that Merit Scholarship application
everyone's so stressed about.

08:43.789 --> 08:45.292
What- What application?

08:45.359 --> 08:47.737
Let's begin by talking about
the A. P. physics test...

08:47.794 --> 08:50.070
which, as you know, takes place on-

08:50.130 --> 08:52.508
May 21 .

08:52.566 --> 08:55.308
With Luke and Haley, I'm on top of everything
because they aren't.

08:55.369 --> 09:00.944
But Alex is so self-sufficient,
I just sort of put it in cruise control.

09:01.008 --> 09:04.615
I've fallen asleep at the wheel,
and now my little genius is covered in cake.

09:04.678 --> 09:07.852
Now a list of practice tests
I recommend the students take before then:

09:07.915 --> 09:10.555
3-A, 4-C...

09:10.617 --> 09:12.392
12-A through F...

09:12.452 --> 09:14.329
18-D, 19-A...

09:14.388 --> 09:20.304
23-C, 24-G, 25-H, 26-A-

09:20.360 --> 09:22.306
Meanwhile, a great artist
like Bob Dylan...

09:22.362 --> 09:24.433
would get voted off
in the first round, which-

09:24.498 --> 09:27.502
if you wet the end,
it will stick to his face.

09:27.568 --> 09:30.674
- You're a genius.
- Piper, that's rude.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.978
You know, Manny, in chorus
we sang "Blowin' in the Wind."

09:33.807 --> 09:35.309
Now that's blowin' in the wind.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.514
You're funny, Luke.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.489
Manny and I need to use the restroom.

09:39.546 --> 09:41.048
We do?

09:43.450 --> 09:45.020
You've gotta switch with me.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.621
What? No, we can't do that.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.530
They're twins. They'll never notice.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.796
You realize we're not twins, right?

09:52.526 --> 09:55.370
Special dollhouse delivery for Lily.

09:55.429 --> 09:58.205
- It's here, it's here!
- I think you're going to love it.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.472
I spent so many hours
playing with this when I was your age.

10:00.534 --> 10:02.844
Yeah, me too.
Hey, quick, turn off your car.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.405
Why? it's in park, I think.

10:04.471 --> 10:06.246
I have a judgy green neighbor.

10:06.306 --> 10:09.219
He had the nerve to come over here
and tell me that I'm not green enough.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.586
- Shut up! You're super green.
- Thank you.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.352
I'm- I'm recycling a dollhouse.

10:13.413 --> 10:15.324
I even recycled a child.

10:15.382 --> 10:17.259
- Didn't you win some award?
- Yes, yes.

10:17.317 --> 10:20.696
The State Bar Association Award for Sustained
Excellence in the Field of Environmental-

10:20.754 --> 10:22.324
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the one.
- Law.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.391
There was one word left.
You didn't have to cut me off.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.597
- Dollhouse, please.
- Okay. Okay.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.402
- You know what you should do?
- Hmm?

10:29.463 --> 10:32.842
March right over there
and wave that trophy in his stupid eco face.

10:32.899 --> 10:36.346
- No. You think?
- Yes. Those people are so annoying.

10:36.403 --> 10:40.249
There's this girl at my school who was all
over me about my boots 'cause they're leather.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.913
Meanwhile, she's wearing Crocs,
like those aren't endangered.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.717
You know what? I am gonna do that.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.917
Show him to out-green me.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.687
- Okay. Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.592
- All right, those are blowing into his yard.
- Oh, crap.

10:50.651 --> 10:52.255
Okay, that's definitely
gonna hurt my case.

10:52.319 --> 10:55.129
Uh, you pick these up.
I'm gonna go get the trophy. Lily, help her.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.759
I heard that "recycled child" comment.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.637
Thanks to your little flask,
now the teacher thinks I'm a burnout.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.108
Football game.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.543
- Football game!
- What are you doing?

11:07.601 --> 11:09.444
You can do this now.
I saw it in a commercial.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.881
Not with that phone.
You might as well say it into your wallet.

11:11.938 --> 11:13.474
Come on.
We're gonna be late for math.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.986
- I'm not going to any more boring classes.
- You're just gonna cut?

11:16.043 --> 11:18.819
No, I'm just not gonna go
because I'm in my 60s.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.359
Teachers' lounge.

11:21.415 --> 11:23.861
- They got a TV in here.
- We can't go in the teachers' lounge.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.954
- Why not?
- Um, it's for teachers only.

11:26.019 --> 11:29.364
You're a teacher. Right now,
you're teaching me how to be a little bitch.

11:30.257 --> 11:31.964
Jay, don't. Jay.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.368
Jay!

11:35.696 --> 11:38.302
So, when do you think
you'll be making your decision?

11:38.365 --> 11:40.606
Oh, sometime in the next week or so.

11:40.667 --> 11:43.307
Oh, take your time.
It would be rude to rush you.

11:43.370 --> 11:46.351
Not as rude as interrupting two people
in the middle of a conversation.

11:46.406 --> 11:49.580
Well, actually, I'll go.
I'm gonna go grab some coffee.

11:49.643 --> 11:53.318
Good idea, because
those cupcakes look very dry.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.054
Hi. This is unbelievable.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.289
They just gave me four books
on applying to top colleges.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.024
When am I gonna have time
to read all this?

12:01.588 --> 12:04.228
Oh, my gosh.
I'm so sorry. I didn't see you there.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.793
Come on, girls.

12:05.859 --> 12:09.272
Oh, she saw me. Everybody sees me.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.570
- Who was that?
- Dr. Dooda Dada.

12:11.631 --> 12:15.169
She thinks that she can flirt her son
all the way to Washington...

12:15.235 --> 12:16.942
but I'm gonna take her down.

12:17.003 --> 12:20.143
- I would love to chat, but I got to get to A. P. calc.
- Okay.

12:20.207 --> 12:23.347
Physical education is a critical part
of every school day.

12:23.410 --> 12:26.289
As we develop the mind,
so we must the body.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.087
This begins with good nutrition...

12:28.148 --> 12:30.321
uh, physical activity, sportsmanship...

12:30.383 --> 12:31.862
and attention to personal hygiene.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.454
No, please, please. Please don't go.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.558
I know this is boring,
but this isn't my idea.

12:36.623 --> 12:39.194
I wanted to play a spirited game
of dodgeball, but-

12:39.259 --> 12:42.502
That sounds fun. I'll play dodgeball.

12:42.562 --> 12:43.870
I'll play too.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.466
Anything's gotta be better than this.

12:45.532 --> 12:48.638
Oh, well, you know what?
We're really not supposed to.

12:48.702 --> 12:50.375
But you know what?
Hey, guys, listen to this.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.917
My name's Cam.
I'm the sheriff of dodge...

12:53.573 --> 12:55.177
ball.

12:55.242 --> 12:58.746
Okay, you guys are the Hatfields.
You are the McCoys.

12:58.812 --> 13:01.691
Mr. Mandelbaum, I'd like you to stay seated.
You're gonna be our referee.

13:01.748 --> 13:04.752
All right, everybody, let's dodgeball.

13:04.818 --> 13:07.094
Dodgeball was a smash.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.361
Dr. Donna and Gloria
were like two assassins...

13:09.422 --> 13:13.370
justpicking off their victims one by one.

13:15.996 --> 13:18.203
Okay, last two dodge-ballers.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.541
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.479
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

13:25.138 --> 13:27.880
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- I'm going to kill you!

13:27.941 --> 13:29.511
Gloria, Gloria, Gloria, no!

13:31.578 --> 13:33.080
Ow! My eye!

13:38.285 --> 13:41.391
So you like theater, and you just put
this fake thumb in our fries.

13:41.454 --> 13:42.455
Yep.

13:43.790 --> 13:45.201
I'm gonna go out on a limb here...

13:45.258 --> 13:46.430
and say we're with the wrong people.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.973
Let's just switch dates
and get this party started.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.475
- What? We don't want to switch.
- Yeah.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.101
I'm not attracted to you.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.146
And I'm not attracted to you.

13:55.202 --> 13:58.240
Wait a minute. We like all the same things,
but you don't think I'm cute?

13:58.305 --> 14:00.251
I've got a thing for Latin men.

14:00.307 --> 14:03.584
- I like 'em dumb.
- Well, that's just offensive.

14:03.643 --> 14:06.624
And shallow. Just because we're guys
doesn't mean we don't have feelings.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.921
Yeah. I don't feel good about this.

14:08.982 --> 14:12.623
It makes me feel... bad.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.097
Come on, Luke. Let's get out of here.

14:14.154 --> 14:17.294
Our parents aren't home.
If you want, we'll make out with you.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.393
I'm not proud of what happened next.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.667
I am.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.975
He's not home.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.536
How's the cleanup going?

14:29.603 --> 14:31.742
Well, I think I got most of 'em.

14:31.805 --> 14:33.944
You've been at this a while.
How come you only have eight peanuts?

14:34.007 --> 14:35.543
Instead of carrying them around...

14:35.609 --> 14:38.488
I made a huge pile right over th-

14:38.545 --> 14:41.082
- Again?
- Geez. They're everywhere.

14:41.147 --> 14:42.592
Oh, God. Oh! Bird!

14:42.649 --> 14:45.220
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no!

14:45.285 --> 14:49.028
Oh, no! What is that smell?
It smells like French fries.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.693
It's biodiesel. Can you plug it up?

14:50.757 --> 14:52.430
Oh, what? With what? Popcorn?

14:52.492 --> 14:55.496
- Oh, geez. No!
- My boots. This is a disaster!

14:55.562 --> 14:57.064
Save the seals!

14:57.130 --> 14:58.973
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the hell?

14:59.032 --> 15:00.705
What did you do?

15:00.767 --> 15:04.044
Uh, I won a green award. That's what.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.551
You think you can
get this thing to work?

15:07.607 --> 15:09.780
Hey, you're supposed to be the lookout.
What if somebody walks in?

15:09.843 --> 15:12.983
Gee, they'll call my parents.
Hey, look. You did it!

15:13.046 --> 15:15.993
Yeah, it's not that big of a deal.
Listen, I'm gonna get back to class.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.893
Before you go,
let me ask you a question.

15:18.952 --> 15:21.125
How do you know how to do
all this stuff?

15:21.187 --> 15:23.167
Back in high school,
I was in the A.V. club.

15:23.223 --> 15:24.930
We did all kinds of crazy things.

15:24.991 --> 15:26.834
One year, we hid a microphone
in the gym.

15:26.893 --> 15:29.339
We could totally hear everything
that was going on at prom.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.637
I used to make fun of guys like you.

15:31.698 --> 15:34.178
- This is pretty cool.
- Really?

15:35.568 --> 15:37.377
You think this is cool?

15:37.437 --> 15:39.314
Yeah!

15:39.372 --> 15:41.215
- First down!
- All right.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.379
Best open house ever.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.354
It's all gravy when you're in the A.V.

15:45.412 --> 15:48.859
Admit it. Doesn't it feel good to break
a few rules, take a walk on the wild side?

15:48.915 --> 15:50.588
- You're welcome.
- No, you're welcome.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.323
I'm the one who set this whole thing up.

15:52.385 --> 15:55.730
- Let's just say we make a good team.
- To us.

15:55.789 --> 15:57.291
There he goes. There he goes!

15:57.357 --> 15:58.734
- Come on, come on!
- Come on!

15:58.792 --> 16:00.499
Yeah!

16:04.564 --> 16:07.738
I've been like this
for as long as I can remember.

16:07.801 --> 16:09.838
Can you give me an example?

16:09.903 --> 16:13.112
Well, when I was little,
I was in a spelling bee at school...

16:13.173 --> 16:15.676
and I really wanted to win.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.722
I don't know why. There was no prize.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.484
No one cared.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.219
My parents didn't even know I was in it.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.488
I just felt this weight on my shoulders...

16:23.550 --> 16:26.030
like if I lost, I'd-

16:26.086 --> 16:27.690
I don't know. I just had to win.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.131
- And did you?
- Yep.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.862
- Know what the winning word was?
- Hmm.

16:30.924 --> 16:32.426
Responsibility.

16:34.027 --> 16:36.439
Is that what you feel-

16:36.496 --> 16:41.468
a responsibility to win all the time,
to always be the best?

16:41.534 --> 16:43.036
That's one way to put it.

16:43.103 --> 16:46.209
And this responsibility-
Where does it come from?

16:46.272 --> 16:47.774
I'm not sure.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.650
It's just... there.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.950
So it's an internal pressure.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.222
Yeah. Kind of.

16:56.282 --> 17:00.321
I mean, once you start overachieving,
people expect things from you.

17:00.387 --> 17:04.335
- Like what people?
- You know, the world-

17:05.558 --> 17:08.505
Teachers, parents, other kids.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.507
It's not all internal.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.440
Don't get me wrong.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.569
I like the way I'm wired.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.843
It's what's going to get me into a good school.
It's what makes me who I am.

17:17.904 --> 17:20.510
And how is that- being who you are?

17:20.573 --> 17:22.108
I don't know.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.676
Mostly good.

17:24.676 --> 17:26.849
A little exhausting.

17:26.913 --> 17:29.450
Sometimes hard.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.018
I guess there's your answer.

17:31.084 --> 17:34.361
It's hard being me.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.367
Tell me a little more about your family.

17:36.423 --> 17:39.131
They're pretty normal, I guess.

17:39.192 --> 17:42.264
I'm not like any of them,
but that doesn't really bother me.

17:42.328 --> 17:46.401
- Ever? - Only when they say things
like "Alex, you study too much"...

17:46.466 --> 17:50.608
or "Don't freak out"
or "Go do something fun."

17:50.670 --> 17:54.641
So your siblings- They don't experience
the same pressures you do.

17:54.707 --> 17:57.119
- Oh, God, no. They don't care about school.
- Hmm.

17:57.177 --> 17:59.783
Why do you think that is?
You all grew up in the same house...

17:59.846 --> 18:02.292
with the same parents,
yet you're the only one...

18:02.348 --> 18:06.160
who feels this enormous pressure
to achieve at such a high level.

18:06.219 --> 18:07.960
Why do we even have to talk
about my family?

18:08.021 --> 18:10.627
They don't have anything
to do with this.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.260
They don't get me.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.335
How's that feel?

18:15.395 --> 18:16.635
I don't know.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.869
You're a smart girl.
Try a little harder.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.707
I said I don't know.

18:25.839 --> 18:27.341
I feel...

18:29.442 --> 18:30.944
kind of alone.

18:32.312 --> 18:35.418
I realize our juniors
are busy with S.A.T.'s...

18:35.482 --> 18:38.486
so as a rule, I only give
two hours of homework a night.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.553
- Two hours?
- Our students are highly advanced.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.224
It's nothing they can't handle.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.961
No, I'm- I'm sure they can.

18:44.023 --> 18:46.025
It's just that if they have
two hours in this class...

18:46.092 --> 18:47.765
and they have an hour for A. P. bio...

18:47.827 --> 18:50.899
and an hour and a half for,
um, advanced lit and-

18:50.964 --> 18:54.002
Hang on one second. Let me just do this
on the board, 'cause then it's-

18:54.067 --> 18:57.105
Um, we got two and one and 1 .5.

18:57.170 --> 19:01.084
And then another hour and a half
for A. P. history.

19:01.141 --> 19:03.781
Gives us-

19:03.843 --> 19:07.256
- It's six.
- Yes! Nina, I was getting there.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.919
Thank you. Thank you so much.
If I could just have a second to think...

19:09.983 --> 19:12.589
without all the tippy-tappy typing.

19:12.652 --> 19:13.756
Six.

19:15.722 --> 19:18.134
Well, I hope you're happy.
You've ruined dodgeball for everyone.

19:18.191 --> 19:20.262
She was the one
who threw that ball in my face.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.602
Only because you threw yourself
at Mr. Ingram.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.699
Okay, ladies, please.
Can't you see what's going on here?

19:24.764 --> 19:27.938
You both just want
what's best for your kids.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.607
- Huh?
- I need to get this trip for Wesley.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.946
I'm tired of him being
so mad at me all the time.

19:33.006 --> 19:34.451
Why is he mad?

19:34.507 --> 19:36.077
Oh, he blames me for the divorce.

19:36.142 --> 19:38.281
His father will always be the hero.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.221
It's hard to blame someone
who's never there.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.226
Now can't you relate to that?

19:42.282 --> 19:44.455
It will get better.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.327
Kids always figure out
who's really there for them.

19:47.387 --> 19:51.164
Again, we're very sorry about the projector.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.226
I'll send a check on Monday.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.829
- Hi, honey.
- I got in trouble.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.737
Whatever she did, add it to my tab.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.606
All right, let's do this.
No. No, no, no.

19:59.666 --> 20:02.146
Not you two, just you. Come on, Sheriff.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.180
Oh. Hey, honey. How did it go?

20:07.240 --> 20:08.913
Good. And I made
another session for next week.

20:08.975 --> 20:11.478
- How was the open house?
- Wow. So intense.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.320
I had no idea
the kind of pressure you're under.

20:14.380 --> 20:17.827
Honey, I was just you for two hours.
I could barely hold it together.

20:17.884 --> 20:21.457
I don't know how
you don't have a meltdown every day. I-

20:21.521 --> 20:23.660
Oh, honey.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.532
Sweetie, what? Did I say something?

20:25.592 --> 20:27.230
Yes.

20:27.293 --> 20:28.795
Thank you.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.876
Okay. Okay.

20:34.968 --> 20:36.470
Okay.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.176
Okay.

20:41.007 --> 20:42.509
It's okay.

20:46.212 --> 20:48.249
Again, I am so sorry.

20:48.314 --> 20:49.987
I guess, in retrospect,
it was a little crazy...

20:50.049 --> 20:52.859
- that I wanted to show you my State Bar Association Award.
- Stop.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.525
And it's possible I come on
a little too strong.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.432
No. No, no. I like to think that
I'm greener than I am...

20:58.491 --> 21:01.768
but maybe I just want the credit
without doing all the hard work that you do.

21:01.828 --> 21:03.068
Well, you're right, it is hard...

21:03.129 --> 21:04.904
but, you know, it's also alienating.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.807
No one wants to be friends with me.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.039
I can't tell you the last time
I had people over for dinner...

21:09.102 --> 21:10.672
which is probably a good thing.

21:10.737 --> 21:13.343
You know, with solar power,
it takes four days to roast a chicken.

21:13.406 --> 21:15.443
- Really?
- If you want it cooked all the way through, yeah.

21:15.508 --> 21:17.385
- Hmm.
- You know I had salmonella three times?

21:17.443 --> 21:21.186
Wow. if you want to come over
to our house for dinner, we kind of owe you.

21:21.247 --> 21:22.749
You can play with my dollhouse.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.419
Yeah?

21:24.484 --> 21:25.827
Is it made from sustainable materials?

21:25.885 --> 21:27.228
Forget it.
