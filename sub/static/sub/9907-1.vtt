-Terry?
-Denise, why aren't you in Science?

02:54.649 --> 02:57.982
They're showing a filmstrip,
everyone left. l have to talk to you.

02:58.152 --> 03:01.519
-l'm really into this article.
-l know, but l need your advice...

03:01.689 --> 03:05.125
...and you are my best friend,
and l tried to deal with it myself...

03:05.293 --> 03:07.261
...and l'm really stressed out!

03:07.428 --> 03:10.864
Three guys wanna take me out,
l'm not too thrilled by any of them...

03:11.032 --> 03:15.196
...but think l should go in case l don't
have a real boyfriend by the prom.

03:15.369 --> 03:19.806
-Okay, who are the guys?
-lf l give you names, you cannot laugh.

03:19.974 --> 03:23.375
l know, you have
the perfect college boyfriend.

03:23.544 --> 03:27.571
-You think Kevin's perfect?
-He's a god, okay?

03:27.749 --> 03:31.651
Can we talk about me now?
Where was l?

03:31.819 --> 03:36.688
Bruce Shulman, Edward Zink
and Roger Gibbler.

03:36.858 --> 03:39.918
-This is serious.
-l know.

03:40.561 --> 03:46.625
All right, on a scale of lame to cute
who rates the least low?

03:47.301 --> 03:48.791
They're all lame.

03:48.970 --> 03:52.599
Put Roger in a rent-a-tux,
he might move up to semi-lame.

03:53.374 --> 03:55.774
Okay, forget looks,
who's got the hottest car?

03:55.943 --> 04:00.175
A Pinto, dad's Skylark
and a Schwinn.

04:00.515 --> 04:03.040
Looks like you're gonna have
to skip the prom.

04:03.217 --> 04:07.085
Hey. Hey, everybody.
Listen up! Hey.

04:07.255 --> 04:10.349
A lot of you've been giving me
grief about this S <i>un-Tribune</i>...

04:10.525 --> 04:12.220
...journalism competition.

04:12.393 --> 04:15.021
Well, l finally got
all of your submissions read.

04:15.196 --> 04:17.289
Now, during my planning period...

04:17.464 --> 04:20.195
...l picked the best two,
and then from those...

04:20.368 --> 04:24.930
...and from those submitted by
your pals over at Sturgis-Wilder.

04:27.975 --> 04:29.408
Thank you.

04:29.577 --> 04:33.172
The <i>Trib</i> will pick one and award
somebody a summer internship.

04:33.347 --> 04:34.644
Okay?

04:34.816 --> 04:39.651
l'll post the names of the winners in
the trophy case after l finish my lunch.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.051
Tuna salad on whole wheat.

04:45.226 --> 04:48.286
A summer job at the S <i>un-Tribune</i>,
think about it.

04:48.462 --> 04:52.193
l'll think about that, you think about me
at the prom with a lizard.

04:52.366 --> 04:54.960
-l think you're exaggerating.
-Hi, Denise!

04:55.136 --> 04:57.900
Are you busy Saturday night?

04:58.139 --> 04:59.629
Sorry.

05:08.416 --> 05:09.906
Mr. Raymaker...

05:10.084 --> 05:13.053
...Mr. Vino, the driver's ed. teacher,
just ran over a dog.

05:13.221 --> 05:15.382
Should l take a photographer?

05:16.023 --> 05:17.513
No.

05:22.997 --> 05:25.124
What's up, Terry?

05:25.566 --> 05:27.830
-How's it going, Terry?
-Hi, guys.

05:28.002 --> 05:29.526
Hi, guys.

05:29.704 --> 05:31.604
Bye, guys.

05:31.772 --> 05:35.139
-Am l invisible?
-They were in a hurry.

05:35.309 --> 05:37.777
You are so hot.

05:37.945 --> 05:41.005
Buddy, l just ate.

05:41.649 --> 05:45.085
-Thanks for stopping by, Bud.
-Anytime, sis.

05:45.253 --> 05:48.120
Our parents are gone for two weeks.
Know what that means?

05:48.289 --> 05:50.757
Their king-size bed is empty.

05:51.058 --> 05:52.582
Well, what do you think?

05:52.760 --> 05:57.220
l think if you and l were
the last man and woman on Earth...

05:57.398 --> 05:59.866
...the human race would die out.

06:01.235 --> 06:05.035
You want time to think it over.
l understand.

06:05.206 --> 06:08.573
l have two words for you,
slumber party.

06:08.743 --> 06:13.043
We'll invite every girl you know:
tall, short, loose, easy.

06:13.214 --> 06:15.978
l'll be the bartender,
they can use my bedroom...

06:16.150 --> 06:18.243
...they can use my body.

06:18.419 --> 06:22.378
-l wanna help.
-You wanna molest my friends.

06:24.392 --> 06:26.360
-Forget it.
-Why?

06:26.527 --> 06:29.587
You'll have a party, and l'll....

06:30.998 --> 06:34.957
-Oh, God.
-Does he do this at the dinner table?

06:35.169 --> 06:38.605
Don't get me wrong,
it's not like l've never had sex before.

06:38.773 --> 06:43.039
l've had lots of sex. lt's just that now
l'd like to try it with a partner.

06:44.011 --> 06:46.479
We really have to get back
to school.

06:47.181 --> 06:49.411
Yes, we must get back.

06:50.017 --> 06:52.451
Wanna make sure
my article's in the trophy case.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.884
Yes, we really must get going.

06:55.056 --> 06:57.684
You have to get going?
l'm 1 5 years old.

06:57.858 --> 07:01.624
ln two years, l reach the peak
of my sexual powers.

07:01.829 --> 07:04.923
The clock is ticking,
l have to get jamming.

07:05.099 --> 07:08.262
Can't you hear
what you're saying?

07:09.103 --> 07:12.561
-Aren't you a little embarrassed?
-Nope, l'm horny.

07:12.740 --> 07:16.176
Horny will kick embarrassment's ass
every time.

07:16.344 --> 07:17.868
Budster, listen to me.

07:18.045 --> 07:21.708
Don't you want your first time
to be with someone you love?

07:21.882 --> 07:25.113
l guarantee you, l'll be in love.

07:25.853 --> 07:30.517
There's Lisa Macadoo,
l hear she'll do anything with anybody.

07:30.691 --> 07:34.127
She looks pretty cheap to me.

07:34.328 --> 07:36.353
Me too.

07:37.865 --> 07:41.596
l am so excited. You know this job
means, like, everything in life to me.

07:41.769 --> 07:43.600
l know.
Work in the sports section.

07:43.771 --> 07:46.171
That way we can interview
all the cute jocks.

07:46.340 --> 07:50.504
You are gonna be so proud of me,
l'm gonna make such a great reporter.

07:52.480 --> 07:55.916
-l'm not there.
-Why aren't you there?

07:57.184 --> 08:00.711
Neal Perlow and Joseph Dreyer?!

08:11.232 --> 08:14.360
And then l had Terry Griffith,
fourth period Civics.

08:14.535 --> 08:16.594
Did you see what she's wearing?

08:16.771 --> 08:19.365
The legs do not stop.

08:19.540 --> 08:22.168
l say we flunk her,
keep her here for another year.

08:23.944 --> 08:26.276
You better be careful,
you could lose your job.

08:26.447 --> 08:29.883
lt'd be worth it,
it's not that great a job.

08:36.724 --> 08:39.215
-Terry.
-What's wrong with my article?

08:40.961 --> 08:43.657
Well, there isn't anything
wrong with it, per se...

08:43.831 --> 08:45.321
...it's just...

08:45.499 --> 08:49.026
-...not outstanding work.
-Well, l think it is.

08:49.203 --> 08:52.400
What do you give me straight
A's for, my wardrobe?

08:52.940 --> 08:56.899
l give you the A's because
of your hard work. And you write well.

08:57.078 --> 09:01.037
But this contest,
it's a completely different ballgame.

09:01.215 --> 09:03.410
When l read those articles,
l have to ask...

09:03.584 --> 09:05.677
...does this person
have a nose for news?

09:05.853 --> 09:08.378
Do they dig out
the most interesting angle?

09:08.556 --> 09:11.992
So, what you're trying to tell me
is that the nutritional content...

09:12.159 --> 09:14.855
...of our school lunches
isn't interesting.

09:16.163 --> 09:19.599
Look, Terry,
l know that you're disappointed.

09:19.767 --> 09:22.258
But l had to pick kids
who've got a real shot...

09:22.436 --> 09:24.461
...at becoming
professional journalists.

09:24.638 --> 09:27.004
l am going to be a reporter.

09:27.541 --> 09:30.203
That's good.
l like that attitude.

09:30.377 --> 09:34.609
But don't you think it would be nice
to have something to fall back on?

09:34.782 --> 09:36.340
Like what?

09:36.951 --> 09:39.442
Well, you're a pretty girl,
you could be a model.

09:39.687 --> 09:41.086
Be a model?

09:41.255 --> 09:44.088
Why, because a pretty girl
can't possibly have a brain?

09:44.258 --> 09:47.284
-Look, what l meant was--
-l know what you meant!

09:47.461 --> 09:51.124
This is a great article
and it belongs at the S <i>un-Tribune</i>.

09:51.765 --> 09:56.759
And you are so clueless to life,
it is really pathetic!

10:10.451 --> 10:13.113
Terry, it's Mr. Wonderful.

10:22.663 --> 10:25.291
Always when l'm busy.

10:28.569 --> 10:30.696
-She's in the pool.
-What took you so long?

10:30.871 --> 10:35.171
-l knew it was you.
-l keep forgetting how young you are.

10:35.342 --> 10:37.970
What a waste of a sports car.

10:45.452 --> 10:48.148
Listen, everything's gonna be
all right.

10:52.259 --> 10:54.454
How'd this get in here?

11:00.201 --> 11:04.535
-Why do you always tie double knots?
-Kevin, please, forget the knot.

11:04.705 --> 11:07.367
What l need is a little sympathy.

11:07.541 --> 11:11.136
l had my heart set
on that summer job.

11:11.445 --> 11:13.106
Terry.

11:13.614 --> 11:16.310
l know exactly how you feel.

11:16.850 --> 11:19.148
Can l tell you a little story?

11:19.853 --> 11:24.153
When l was a kid,
l was obsessed with being a fireman.

11:24.325 --> 11:28.955
l used to set little fires in the back
yard, and l'd practice putting them out.

11:29.930 --> 11:31.830
Then one day...

11:32.566 --> 11:35.865
...when l was 1 2,
l learned l could never be a fireman.

11:36.537 --> 11:38.266
Why, what happened?

11:38.439 --> 11:42.466
l found out how much money
they make. Pitiful.

11:43.477 --> 11:47.106
Don't you understand
that l don't care what reporters make?

11:47.281 --> 11:51.377
l can't remember a time when there
was anything else l wanted to do.

11:51.552 --> 11:55.682
And it's discouraging when Raymaker
tells me that l should become a model.

11:55.856 --> 11:58.518
Hey, why not?
You're a knockout.

11:58.692 --> 12:02.492
Besides, models make
some pretty nice bucks.

12:02.663 --> 12:04.563
You don't think l can do it either.

12:04.732 --> 12:08.930
Well, no, that's not exactly
what l said, exactly.

12:09.103 --> 12:11.162
Yeah, well, it was close enough.

12:11.338 --> 12:14.637
You know, it's lucky for you
l'm in love with you, l think...

12:15.175 --> 12:18.201
...or l'd probably never
speak to you again.

12:18.846 --> 12:20.973
l'd like to be alone, please.

12:21.148 --> 12:23.810
Now? Can't you be alone
when your parents are home?

12:23.984 --> 12:26.544
Since you haven't listened
to one word l've said...

12:26.720 --> 12:30.850
...why don't you try reading my lips.
Goodbye, Kevin.

12:31.025 --> 12:33.789
Would you rather spend the night
at the frat house?

12:39.433 --> 12:43.699
-All men care about is sex!
-l resent that.

12:45.472 --> 12:47.531
Big improvement, huh?

12:47.708 --> 12:50.006
The room needed something.

12:50.177 --> 12:54.170
Your room is why my life
is totally screwed up.

12:54.348 --> 12:59.149
You guys think beautiful women are
nothing but decoration, total airheads.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.912
Hey, not me.

13:01.088 --> 13:04.524
These women
have my deepest respect.

13:05.225 --> 13:07.785
For showing their boobs?

13:08.128 --> 13:10.289
And for their minds.

13:10.464 --> 13:15.265
lt just so happens that Kim here
reads Vonnegut in her bubble bath.

13:15.436 --> 13:17.961
And Luanne has dedicated
her centerfold...

13:18.138 --> 13:20.538
...to help clean up toxic waste.

13:20.708 --> 13:25.270
And the only reason Barbara does
her physics homework buck-naked...

13:25.446 --> 13:27.971
...is because that library's hot.

13:29.283 --> 13:31.046
Come on, Buddy, admit it...

13:31.218 --> 13:35.211
...you would love to spend your entire
life just using women's bodies.

13:35.389 --> 13:37.482
Yeah, all but the last 60 seconds.

13:38.459 --> 13:40.757
l'd like a little time to reminisce.

13:41.295 --> 13:44.594
Can't you think of anything
more profound than getting laid?

13:44.765 --> 13:46.665
A blowjob?

13:47.968 --> 13:51.734
-Hey, l'm sorry.
-This is the perfect end to my day.

13:51.905 --> 13:54.738
l mean, it's as if women's lib
never existed.

13:54.908 --> 13:59.777
Today's woman has the freedom to be
just as sick and perverted as us guys.

13:59.947 --> 14:01.938
Oh, that's wonderful.

14:02.116 --> 14:06.610
l mean, l write an excellent article,
and just because l'm cute...

14:06.787 --> 14:09.779
...no one takes me seriously.
lt's not fair!

14:09.957 --> 14:13.393
And yet, somehow
you find the courage to go on living.

14:13.560 --> 14:15.687
You got guts.

14:15.863 --> 14:18.297
Sometimes l just wish l were a guy.

14:19.066 --> 14:20.328
No, you don't.

14:20.501 --> 14:24.403
The male body needs sex at all times.
lt's a living hell.

14:25.139 --> 14:30.133
l bet if a guy turned in the same article
it would be at the S <i>un-Tribune</i> now.

14:30.310 --> 14:32.210
Yeah, no kidding.

14:33.213 --> 14:35.704
Hey, does Miss April
look straight?

14:43.190 --> 14:46.785
What are the odds of this being
a homeless nymphomaniac?

14:48.395 --> 14:50.795
-ls your sister home?
-Yeah.

14:50.964 --> 14:53.489
Hey, Terry, you got company.

14:56.703 --> 14:58.193
Terry?

15:00.574 --> 15:03.702
Why am l brain damaged?
l just fooled my own brother.

15:03.877 --> 15:07.711
Hey, l wasn't paying attention.
Now l am. Hello, Terry.

15:07.881 --> 15:10.349
l think l can pull this off.

15:10.517 --> 15:14.385
This morning l knew her.
l talked to her, she screamed at me...

15:14.555 --> 15:18.548
...everything was great.
Now she's wearing my clothes.

15:18.725 --> 15:22.161
-Who do you think you are, Tootsie?
-No.

15:22.329 --> 15:26.493
Okay, Yentl,
what do you wanna be, a rabbi?

15:27.401 --> 15:29.562
Just tell me what's wrong.

15:29.736 --> 15:31.226
Really?

15:33.707 --> 15:36.608
Okay, well....

15:37.945 --> 15:39.640
Look how you're standing.

15:39.813 --> 15:41.906
l mean, drop your hands.

15:42.082 --> 15:44.209
Okay, now stick your hip in.

15:44.384 --> 15:46.545
All right,
now move your feet apart.

15:46.753 --> 15:50.211
Okay.
Guys take up space.

15:50.691 --> 15:52.784
All right,
now you gotta look tougher.

15:53.393 --> 15:56.658
Very crucial,
something every guy does...

15:56.830 --> 15:59.321
...let me see you
scratch your balls.

15:59.833 --> 16:02.301
Hey, come on, try it.

16:07.608 --> 16:09.633
Wait a minute.

16:09.810 --> 16:12.005
Watch the master.

16:12.179 --> 16:15.410
Now first, there's your basic shift.

16:19.820 --> 16:21.447
But that's not always enough.

16:21.622 --> 16:25.718
Sometimes you've got to get inside,
dig a little, let some air in...

16:25.893 --> 16:27.485
...move things around.

16:28.095 --> 16:30.893
Yeah, well, maybe
my balls don't itch.

16:31.598 --> 16:34.328
All balls itch, it's a fact.

16:35.335 --> 16:37.565
Well, maybe this would help.

16:44.378 --> 16:46.243
Not bad.

16:48.549 --> 16:51.712
Shit, maybe l should try that.

16:51.885 --> 16:54.979
Okay, let's see you walk.

16:56.089 --> 16:57.954
Hold it!

16:59.459 --> 17:03.190
Look, you got balls now, use them.

17:04.464 --> 17:05.954
Say, baby, what's happening?

17:06.133 --> 17:09.432
l'm a lean, mean sex machine,
and that be the way it is.

17:09.603 --> 17:13.039
Say, baby, what's happening?
l'm a lean, mean sex machine...

17:13.205 --> 17:16.607
...and that be the way it is.

17:16.777 --> 17:19.244
l think you'll pass
as long as you don't move.

17:20.012 --> 17:21.502
l'm gonna do it.

17:21.682 --> 17:25.641
l'm going to take that article to
Sturgis-Wilder and submit it as a guy.

17:25.819 --> 17:30.256
lt makes perfect sense.
Got a problem, you get in drag.

17:30.424 --> 17:33.484
You don't think l can do it,
do you?

17:35.996 --> 17:37.725
No way.

17:37.898 --> 17:40.628
But l'd love to see you try.

18:19.239 --> 18:21.207
Hey, how you doing?

18:21.441 --> 18:23.807
We'll talk more later.

18:25.379 --> 18:27.745
There you go.
Keep lifting those weights.

18:27.914 --> 18:32.044
Once you're into power-blitzing,
doing super-sets is like jerking off.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.951
The key is to work out
every possible minute.

18:35.122 --> 18:37.488
Like, say you don't have any weights.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.751
You use freshmen.

18:40.527 --> 18:42.518
l'm serious.
Excuse me!

18:42.696 --> 18:44.823
This'll just take a minute.

18:45.399 --> 18:47.765
Okay, get a good grip...

18:48.135 --> 18:49.762
...bend your knees and lift.

18:50.270 --> 18:54.070
One, two. One, two.

18:54.908 --> 18:58.810
Hey, no pain, no gain.
This is great for the deltoids.

18:58.979 --> 19:02.244
-Thanks, kid.
-Happy to help.

19:12.259 --> 19:14.227
Who invited you?

19:15.896 --> 19:17.488
l'm new here.

19:17.664 --> 19:20.155
Just what we need, another pussy.

19:22.436 --> 19:25.803
Strong as an ox,
and almost as smart.

19:29.443 --> 19:33.504
Another good exercise for upper body
strength, the pussy toss for distance.

19:33.680 --> 19:36.547
Hey, get off me!
Get off me right-- Get off!

19:39.086 --> 19:42.180
Watch the prickers.
Damn.

19:48.361 --> 19:50.124
Great bunch of guys.

19:50.297 --> 19:52.424
l see you met Greg Tolan.

19:52.599 --> 19:54.931
He kind of runs the school.

19:57.571 --> 19:59.835
l'm Rick Morehouse.

20:01.842 --> 20:04.276
Try not to get us confused.

20:09.583 --> 20:13.883
Willie, will you give us a synopsis
of <i>Catcher in the Rye</i> ?

20:20.761 --> 20:24.697
<i>Catcher in the Rye</i>, a novel
written by the earthling Salinger...

20:24.865 --> 20:29.495
...that every adolescent Homo sapien
in America is forced to read....

20:29.669 --> 20:31.398
You didn't read it, did you?

20:31.571 --> 20:36.634
Our mission on your planet
is to study human behavioral patterns.

20:36.810 --> 20:41.679
Last night, we simulated a daily
teenage ritual, homework avoidance.

20:41.848 --> 20:45.375
We consumed large quantities
of fermented hops and were...

20:45.552 --> 20:49.488
...transformed into degenerate
party animal head-bangers.

20:51.825 --> 20:55.158
-Can l go to the restroom, please?
-Three minutes.

20:55.328 --> 20:57.853
l don't care what galaxy
you two are from.

20:58.031 --> 21:01.091
You've been pulling this routine
for three years.

21:01.268 --> 21:04.203
You'll be here another year
if you don't straighten up.

21:04.371 --> 21:07.101
l want that homework now.

21:09.910 --> 21:12.811
The Earth woman seems so tense.

21:13.013 --> 21:14.503
lrritable.

21:14.681 --> 21:16.478
Too much coffee.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.709
Not enough sex.

22:20.981 --> 22:22.949
Just finished.

22:23.516 --> 22:25.074
l care.

22:34.928 --> 22:38.193
Low-budget
pud-sucking dick nose!

22:50.610 --> 22:52.942
Way to go, big Ter.

23:13.700 --> 23:16.464
Table pressing.
Good for strength and definition.

23:22.142 --> 23:24.133
Full extension is very important.

23:37.891 --> 23:40.121
No pain, no gain.

24:15.362 --> 24:19.992
-Got you!
-Keep your face out of my locker.

24:30.143 --> 24:33.408
-Coach Morrison?
-One moment, son.

24:40.086 --> 24:42.247
Bowling, a great game.

24:42.922 --> 24:44.253
The greatest.

24:44.424 --> 24:46.289
But it's more than a game.

24:46.459 --> 24:48.859
lt's the ultimate challenge.

24:49.229 --> 24:50.856
One man...

24:51.131 --> 24:52.860
...one ball...

24:53.099 --> 24:55.761
...ten pins.

24:55.935 --> 24:59.166
-Ten frames too.
-Exactly!

24:59.706 --> 25:02.641
See, coach, l just transferred here
from another school...

25:02.809 --> 25:06.745
...so l don't have my gym clothes yet,
so l guess l'll just go to study hall.

25:06.913 --> 25:08.540
Hold it!

25:09.916 --> 25:12.680
Everyone dresses
for my gym class.

25:13.119 --> 25:14.711
Everyone.

25:15.088 --> 25:16.112
Great.

25:16.656 --> 25:20.319
l have surprise jock inspections
three times a week.

25:20.493 --> 25:22.552
A word to the wise:

25:22.896 --> 25:24.796
Wear it.

25:33.606 --> 25:36.336
Hey, yo, Mark,
throw me a towel, huh?

25:36.509 --> 25:41.105
-Willie, l hate gym. l really hate gym.
-l really hate gym a lot.

25:41.281 --> 25:43.306
l don't like the smell.

25:48.755 --> 25:50.416
Excuse me.

25:58.398 --> 26:00.161
Oh, it's spreading!

26:00.333 --> 26:02.927
Have you ever seen anything
like this?

26:03.503 --> 26:04.902
Never.

26:05.071 --> 26:08.040
-Early shower squad!
-Get the new kid!

26:14.380 --> 26:16.905
Get off me!
Get off me!

27:43.436 --> 27:44.835
Everybody out! Fire!

27:45.004 --> 27:49.668
Calm, collected!
Take only essential materials!

27:54.581 --> 27:57.709
-Hey, get out of my way!
-There's a fire drill.

28:00.720 --> 28:05.748
We have a saboteur
in our gym class!

28:06.092 --> 28:08.617
A real scum.

28:09.362 --> 28:11.660
A nimrod!

28:12.465 --> 28:16.401
Whoever started that fire...

28:17.303 --> 28:21.034
...is a human gutter ball.

28:21.908 --> 28:24.308
A zero!

28:26.579 --> 28:29.241
Sherbecoe, how many times
have l told you...

28:29.415 --> 28:32.384
...no creatures in my gym class?

28:32.552 --> 28:35.521
lf l left him in the locker,
the alligators would eat him.

28:35.688 --> 28:40.648
You get rid of it, or l'll get rid of it.

28:43.463 --> 28:48.594
lt's all right. lt's okay. He's just
a little upset. Don't worry about it.

28:50.470 --> 28:55.430
Sit. Sit. Stay. Good boy.
Good boy.

28:55.608 --> 28:57.633
Okay, l'll be back soon for you.

28:58.411 --> 29:00.675
l'll take Willie if you take Phil.

29:00.847 --> 29:03.680
Okay, come on, guys.

29:13.159 --> 29:15.024
Okay.

29:15.194 --> 29:17.287
Shirts!
Skins!

29:17.463 --> 29:20.159
Shirts!
Skins!

29:20.967 --> 29:23.492
-All right, let's play some ball.
-Yeah.

29:31.010 --> 29:33.501
Got a problem, son?

29:33.680 --> 29:38.481
Stomach, shooting pains!
l ate in the cafeteria!

29:38.651 --> 29:41.586
Come on, tough it out!

29:41.754 --> 29:46.191
When life rolls you a 7-1 0 split,
what do you do?

29:46.359 --> 29:47.986
Go to the nurse?

29:48.161 --> 29:52.029
No! Hell, no! You aim for
that seven pin and let her rip!

29:56.636 --> 30:01.403
All right. All right.
The rest of you pinheads play ball!

30:06.746 --> 30:10.944
-This is good work.
-l knew it. Thanks, Mr. Mendosa.

30:11.117 --> 30:14.416
But l can't send it
to the S <i>un-Tribune</i>.

30:14.587 --> 30:17.488
-What'd you say?
-Can't send it.

30:17.657 --> 30:23.095
Your writing skills are fine,
but, man, this stuff is really boring.

30:24.330 --> 30:28.130
You gotta grab the reader!
Goose them a little.

30:28.735 --> 30:30.225
Right...

30:30.670 --> 30:31.864
...goose them.

30:32.038 --> 30:35.769
Just because you're a guy doesn't
mean you can't write with sensitivity...

30:35.942 --> 30:38.877
...with feeling, with heart.

30:39.712 --> 30:41.942
But you do show promise.

30:42.115 --> 30:43.446
Look.

30:43.616 --> 30:46.551
l'm not gonna choose the winners
until a week from Monday.

30:46.719 --> 30:49.882
So think of something exciting.
Try again.

30:53.092 --> 30:55.117
Yeah, well...

30:55.294 --> 30:56.886
...thanks.

31:05.671 --> 31:08.196
<i>Terry</i>, I <i>hate</i>
w <i>hen y</i> o <i>u</i>'<i>re</i> d <i>e</i> p <i>re</i> ss <i>e</i> d.

31:08.374 --> 31:14.244
l mean, if you're this upset
over your life, l should be suicidal.

31:14.414 --> 31:16.644
l mean, look what Kevin sent you!

31:17.183 --> 31:20.277
l'd do anything to come home
and find roses.

31:21.020 --> 31:23.784
Can we define
the word ''anything''?

31:24.724 --> 31:28.125
Maybe Raymaker was right
about my article.

31:28.294 --> 31:31.525
But l know l can do better.

31:31.697 --> 31:33.460
l'm just confused.

31:33.633 --> 31:37.262
Of course you're confused,
you're wearing my underwear.

31:38.971 --> 31:43.305
Terry, forget it.
Come back to Pearl.

31:43.476 --> 31:48.209
So you got a bad haircut. You got
a great life and a fabulous boyfriend.

31:48.381 --> 31:49.871
l can't give up.

31:50.049 --> 31:52.574
And today was a disaster,
and l was a major geek...

31:52.752 --> 31:55.084
...but they all thought l was a guy.

31:55.254 --> 31:57.222
l was in the boys' locker room.

31:57.390 --> 31:58.516
-You were?
-Yes.

31:58.691 --> 32:00.090
-And they were?
-Yes.

32:00.259 --> 32:02.159
Can l be your younger brother?

32:02.728 --> 32:04.320
There's a story here.

32:04.497 --> 32:08.263
l don't know what, but l've got until
a week from Monday to find it.

32:08.434 --> 32:14.236
Hey, what about, ''Girl Gets
in Locker Room, Turns Stupid''?

32:17.443 --> 32:20.810
l can still win that job.
l'm gonna go to Sturgis-Wilder...

32:20.980 --> 32:24.108
...and l'm gonna start making
any friends l can find.

32:24.617 --> 32:28.246
What if Kevin finds out you were in
the boys' locker room?

32:28.421 --> 32:32.983
Would Woodward and Bernstein
worry about their girlfriends?

32:33.593 --> 32:34.924
No.

32:35.094 --> 32:39.394
Anyway, Kevin will never find out.

32:39.565 --> 32:41.396
Unless l tell him.

32:41.567 --> 32:46.129
Which l would never do
as long as Denise cooperates.

32:46.739 --> 32:48.366
Denise?

32:48.541 --> 32:50.975
When pigs fly.

32:52.144 --> 32:55.079
Never hurts to ask.

32:59.886 --> 33:02.616
lt's driving me crazy!
l looked everywhere!

33:02.788 --> 33:05.655
l can't find the back of my earring.

33:05.825 --> 33:10.455
What am l supposed to do,
walk around all day with one earring?

33:10.630 --> 33:11.619
lt's so punk.

33:11.797 --> 33:14.561
All you gotta do is break
the eraser off a pencil...

33:14.734 --> 33:18.261
...and use it to hold your earring.
lt'll get you through the day.

33:18.437 --> 33:20.803
Oh, thanks.

33:26.078 --> 33:28.911
l have sisters.

33:44.230 --> 33:47.757
We're in the cafeteria, everything
eats and is eaten by something.

33:47.934 --> 33:51.301
Don't take it personally.
Remember when l--

33:51.804 --> 33:54.136
Hi, l'm Terry Griffith.

33:54.307 --> 33:57.435
Hi, l'm Harold ''Reptile'' Sherbecoe.

33:57.610 --> 34:00.204
lt's time to feed Snowball his lunch.

34:01.380 --> 34:03.678
Oh, Snowball, he's cute.

34:03.849 --> 34:07.341
Oh, that's not Snowball.
No, this is Snowball.

34:08.353 --> 34:10.254
That's lunch.

34:11.524 --> 34:13.685
They don't make snake chow.

34:13.859 --> 34:17.556
-lt was very nice meeting you.
-Nice meeting you too.

34:18.630 --> 34:20.621
Want some company?

34:20.800 --> 34:23.166
Want some company?

34:24.070 --> 34:27.505
-Want some company?
-Yeah, sure.

34:30.909 --> 34:33.208
l'm Terry Griffith.

34:34.013 --> 34:37.005
l'm sorry, l forgot your name.

34:37.183 --> 34:39.674
-Rick Morehouse.
-Oh, yeah, that's it.

34:39.851 --> 34:43.083
Last time we met,
l was in some bushes.

34:43.255 --> 34:45.553
Right, big fun being
the new kid, huh?

34:45.725 --> 34:47.420
Are you new?

34:47.592 --> 34:51.029
Two months ago.
Actually, l'm a professional new kid.

34:51.197 --> 34:54.393
Seven schools in three years,
l really know how to register.

34:54.567 --> 34:55.864
Excuse me?

34:56.369 --> 34:59.566
Hi, thanks, it worked great.

35:00.206 --> 35:02.197
He knew how to fix my earring.

35:02.375 --> 35:05.139
That's because he's a little tulip.

35:07.647 --> 35:10.013
You know Deborah Strowbridge?

35:10.182 --> 35:12.116
Not really.

35:12.284 --> 35:14.479
But l mean, she talked to you.

35:14.654 --> 35:17.088
Deborah Strowbridge is perfection.

35:17.256 --> 35:19.816
Well, it seems to me
like she's got a boyfriend.

35:19.992 --> 35:22.654
Yeah, well, there's no accounting
for taste.

35:22.828 --> 35:24.989
-So are you a senior?
-Yeah.

35:25.164 --> 35:26.893
You going to college?

35:27.066 --> 35:30.467
Well, l like music, and l'd like
to do something in that field...

35:30.636 --> 35:33.469
...but l'm not sure
you have to go to school for it.

35:33.639 --> 35:35.129
l dig music a lot too.

35:35.307 --> 35:39.835
l like the Clash and Talking Heads
and Springsteen and Prince.

35:40.012 --> 35:41.377
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

35:41.547 --> 35:43.174
Listen to this.

35:48.287 --> 35:50.721
Look, what a fox.

35:50.890 --> 35:55.384
Dresses like Elvis Costello,
looks like the Karate Kid.

35:55.828 --> 35:58.729
l'm gonna get him.

36:00.800 --> 36:04.201
Severe intestinal disorder.

36:05.171 --> 36:08.004
What's the matter,
you have a little tummy ache?

36:08.174 --> 36:10.540
What are you, a pussy?

36:16.982 --> 36:21.351
My doctor said that l should be okay
by a week from Monday...

36:21.520 --> 36:24.512
...so l guess
l'll just go to study hall.

36:24.690 --> 36:26.817
No, you won't.

36:28.227 --> 36:31.390
l have a little job for you, son.

36:39.672 --> 36:41.731
Here you go.

36:42.408 --> 36:44.774
Hey, knock yourself out.

36:45.778 --> 36:48.440
You look like
you could use two.

36:48.614 --> 36:51.048
Dragon coming through,
watch your toes.

36:51.217 --> 36:54.050
Come on, Fifi, don't dawdle.
Come on.

36:58.924 --> 37:00.687
What are you looking at?

37:00.860 --> 37:02.589
Nothing.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.730
Tulip.

37:05.131 --> 37:06.826
Hi.

37:07.333 --> 37:09.301
lt's me.

37:10.002 --> 37:12.061
Nice to see you.

37:13.472 --> 37:16.703
Hi, l'm Sandy.

37:17.209 --> 37:19.734
-Terry.
-l know.

37:19.912 --> 37:22.904
That's an incredible tie.
Where did you get it?

37:23.082 --> 37:26.017
-At a store.
-Bitchen.

37:27.386 --> 37:30.150
l guess if you're new,
you don't have a girlfriend.

37:30.322 --> 37:32.813
Yeah, well, l got one back home.

37:32.992 --> 37:35.324
Long-distance relationship?

37:35.895 --> 37:36.919
Good luck.

37:37.096 --> 37:40.190
Yo, Rick, you want a ride home?

37:41.901 --> 37:43.232
Sure.

37:43.402 --> 37:47.304
Yeah, well, gotta go, Sandy,
so l guess l'll see you around.

37:47.840 --> 37:49.865
Yeah, you will.

37:55.548 --> 37:57.709
She's pretty nice.

37:58.217 --> 38:00.082
Yeah, but l got this one rule.

38:00.252 --> 38:02.880
l never go out with girls
who say ''bitchen.''

38:10.696 --> 38:13.028
Pull up right here, this is fine.

38:17.169 --> 38:19.000
Thanks for the ride.

38:19.171 --> 38:21.662
Well, what are you doing now?

38:21.841 --> 38:23.832
Nothing.
Did you want to come in?

38:24.009 --> 38:28.605
Well, l was just gonna tune up my car
and maybe play a little football...

38:28.781 --> 38:31.113
...but yeah, l got time.

38:31.450 --> 38:32.849
Okay.

38:48.367 --> 38:52.861
lf my mom comes home from work
and asks you about my girlfriend...

38:53.038 --> 38:54.471
...just so you know...

38:54.640 --> 38:58.269
...her name is Alice and she looks
a lot like Chrissy Evert Lloyd.

38:59.111 --> 39:02.012
l just don't want her to worry
about my social life.

39:02.181 --> 39:04.513
Yeah, but Chris Evert Lloyd?

39:04.917 --> 39:07.442
lt was Wimbledon week.
You want a beer?

39:07.620 --> 39:10.350
Yeah, l'll take a brewski.

39:19.531 --> 39:22.056
So you don't really have a girlfriend?

39:22.401 --> 39:23.891
You guessed it.

39:24.069 --> 39:26.902
-What about the prom?
-What about it?

39:27.072 --> 39:29.302
Well, you know, sounds all right.

39:29.475 --> 39:33.036
''Passion in Paradise.''
You're renting out that big surf place.

39:33.212 --> 39:34.406
Don't you want to go?

39:34.580 --> 39:38.880
Yeah, but it's kind of a romantic night.
l'd rather not go with my mom.

39:39.051 --> 39:42.145
Well, did you ask anyone?

39:43.322 --> 39:44.880
Well, you better get going.

39:45.057 --> 39:48.117
-Who's your first choice?
-You ask a lot of questions.

39:48.294 --> 39:51.661
Rick, we're rapping man-to-man
about chicks and shit like that.

39:51.830 --> 39:54.128
You know, like, still a virgin?

39:54.300 --> 39:56.097
l don't know.

39:56.268 --> 39:59.203
You don't know?
Weren't you paying attention?

39:59.371 --> 40:02.602
-Are you a virgin?
-No.

40:02.775 --> 40:05.107
Have you slept with a lot of girls?

40:05.277 --> 40:09.145
-No. Have you ever slept with a girl?
-Yeah.

40:09.315 --> 40:12.876
-Well, all right, let's hear the story.
-lt's no big deal.

40:13.052 --> 40:14.713
Just after my dad died...

40:14.887 --> 40:18.550
...this friend of my mom's,
l think she wanted to cheer me up.

40:18.724 --> 40:21.215
She did.

40:23.062 --> 40:24.461
ls that your room?

40:24.630 --> 40:27.895
Wait a minute, don't go in there.
lt's kind of messy.

40:32.805 --> 40:34.796
This is different.

40:34.974 --> 40:36.965
l'm kind of into James Brown.

40:37.643 --> 40:39.042
l guess so.

40:39.211 --> 40:42.374
Prince, Michael Jackson,
it all goes back to James Brown.

40:42.548 --> 40:44.038
The godfather of soul.

40:44.216 --> 40:47.379
Not to mention Mr. Humanitarian,
Mr. Dynamite...

40:47.553 --> 40:50.351
...and the hardest-working man
in show business.

40:50.522 --> 40:53.320
New York City, live,
the Apollo Theater, 1 962.

40:53.492 --> 40:55.153
This man was king.

40:55.327 --> 40:58.990
-Well, let's hear some sounds.
-l don't think so.

40:59.164 --> 41:03.260
-Stereo broken?
-No, it's just something l do by myself.

41:03.435 --> 41:05.903
Well, when l hear James,
l have to dance.

41:06.071 --> 41:09.040
You know, like James,
go crazy, l can't help it.

41:09.208 --> 41:12.837
And l'm usually alone when l do it.

41:13.012 --> 41:15.037
That's cool, man. l can respect that.

41:15.214 --> 41:17.876
How about another brewski, okay?

41:18.050 --> 41:20.018
Okay.

41:22.121 --> 41:27.058
Budster, the refrigerator gives
new meaning to the word ''empty.''

41:27.226 --> 41:31.595
Hey, don't worry about breakfast.
This stuff tastes great cold.

41:31.764 --> 41:35.564
You agreed to do half the shopping
while Mom and Dad were gone.

41:35.734 --> 41:38.259
Yeah, that's right, the second half.

41:38.437 --> 41:41.270
l'll tell you what,
l'll do the dishes.

41:49.214 --> 41:50.977
Thank you.

41:54.053 --> 41:56.487
l can see myself.

41:58.223 --> 41:59.815
l'll get it.

42:01.727 --> 42:03.217
Hello?

42:03.395 --> 42:07.126
Hey, yo, scumbag.
Hey, suck your own.

42:07.833 --> 42:09.095
Eat me.

42:10.836 --> 42:13.532
Hey, same to you, butt face.

42:15.574 --> 42:17.940
Mom says hi.

42:36.895 --> 42:39.261
Yo, Rick, how they hanging?

42:40.599 --> 42:42.362
lt's Terry.

42:43.669 --> 42:46.297
l want you to wear something
really hip tomorrow.

42:46.472 --> 42:49.202
We're gonna get you
a date for the prom.

42:49.374 --> 42:51.740
Just do what l say.

42:52.244 --> 42:56.078
Okay, yeah. Bye-bye.

42:56.248 --> 42:57.840
Scumbag.

42:58.817 --> 43:01.081
Shit, he hung up.

43:08.694 --> 43:13.631
This is your idea of hip,
a guy who is into James Brown?

43:13.799 --> 43:17.166
Could we please just forget
the whole thing?

43:17.336 --> 43:20.601
Now, there is no reason
why you should miss that prom.

43:20.772 --> 43:23.764
A girl would be crazy
to turn you down.

43:23.942 --> 43:27.708
So come on, who is she?

43:29.748 --> 43:32.012
Red sweater.

43:33.952 --> 43:36.352
Cute shoes.

43:38.524 --> 43:40.424
Go for it.

43:42.161 --> 43:44.959
Just waltz right up there
and ask her out?

43:45.130 --> 43:48.657
No, you gotta say something nice...

43:48.834 --> 43:51.803
...like, how pretty her eyes are.

43:51.970 --> 43:55.235
-Girls eat up that crap.
-Come on.

44:08.954 --> 44:12.117
-Hi, Jeanine.
-Hi.

44:12.291 --> 44:16.159
-l'm forgetting your name.
-Rick Morehouse.

44:16.328 --> 44:19.388
You know, l sit right next to you
in Civics class.

44:27.306 --> 44:29.968
You have beautiful eyes.

44:33.779 --> 44:35.940
l'll bet.

44:37.082 --> 44:40.518
Do you have a date for the prom?

44:40.686 --> 44:42.620
Of course, it's next week, why?

44:44.056 --> 44:48.152
Official prom committee survey,
thank you very much.

44:49.695 --> 44:51.663
Terry.

44:55.067 --> 44:58.400
This has got to be the one.
You know why?

44:58.570 --> 45:01.698
Because l've asked everybody else.

45:01.873 --> 45:05.138
No, because l've got this feeling.

45:05.310 --> 45:09.303
True, l've had this feeling before,
but this time....

45:16.088 --> 45:20.320
Beth, are you doing anything
prom night?

45:20.492 --> 45:22.756
l'm going to the prom.

45:23.262 --> 45:25.492
S <i>atur</i> d <i>ay night</i>.

45:25.664 --> 45:27.996
-What about Saturday?
-l'm busy.

45:28.166 --> 45:30.794
-Tonight?
-l'm busy.

45:30.969 --> 45:32.664
-How about Sunday?
-l'm busy.

45:32.838 --> 45:36.296
-How about any night in 1 98 7?
-l'm busy.

45:36.675 --> 45:38.142
I'<i>m</i> so <i>rry</i>.

45:38.310 --> 45:41.404
How about yesterday?
Are you busy yesterday?

45:41.580 --> 45:44.481
l think so,
but you can ask me out again.

45:47.686 --> 45:50.280
-Hi, Terry.
-Oh, hey, Sandy.

45:50.455 --> 45:52.923
Word's out your friend's
desperate for a date.

45:53.091 --> 45:55.924
He would love my cousin, Jill.
She's cute.

45:57.696 --> 45:59.891
-How cute?
-Extremely.

46:00.065 --> 46:04.263
She's got, like, Joan Collins' eyes,
Christy Brinkley's teeth.

46:06.371 --> 46:09.101
What about the rest of her?

46:11.043 --> 46:13.307
Dynamite. Rick has to meet her.

46:13.478 --> 46:17.847
How about if you and me and Rick and
Jill all meet up at the cave tonight?

46:18.016 --> 46:20.246
We'll have a picnic.

46:23.088 --> 46:24.385
Come on, we'll have fun.

46:26.458 --> 46:30.360
This Jill better be some girl.

46:49.548 --> 46:52.517
Buddy, can l borrow
your Army jacket?

46:54.086 --> 46:56.418
What are you doing?

46:56.588 --> 46:58.818
Just cleaning the house.

46:58.990 --> 47:00.890
Budster, are you all right?

47:02.260 --> 47:05.593
l am awesome.

47:06.498 --> 47:09.194
Linda is on her way over.

47:11.536 --> 47:14.164
Excuse me, Mr. Romance,
just out of curiosity...

47:14.339 --> 47:18.799
...does this girl have any idea
she's coming over to light up your life?

47:18.977 --> 47:21.468
Well, technically speaking, not really.

47:21.646 --> 47:24.171
We'll probably start off
with some algebra...

47:24.916 --> 47:28.044
...but once l turn on the charm,
she's mine.

47:29.388 --> 47:31.822
Hand me that massage book, please.

47:32.324 --> 47:34.758
Bud, why don't you take
the subtle approach?

47:34.926 --> 47:38.885
Maybe hang a couple of salamis
from the ceiling.

47:39.498 --> 47:42.296
At least my date is someone
of the opposite sex.

47:44.136 --> 47:46.570
l'm just seeing Sandy for Rick.

47:46.738 --> 47:49.002
For Rick, what happened to research?

47:49.174 --> 47:50.801
Well, that's what l meant.

47:50.976 --> 47:54.935
So for research, you're willing to toy
with this poor girl's emotions?

47:55.113 --> 47:58.048
All you transvestites are alike.

47:58.216 --> 48:00.684
You disgust me.

48:00.852 --> 48:04.310
But of course,
that isn't the real problem here.

48:04.489 --> 48:06.650
Oh, really, what is?

48:06.825 --> 48:08.417
This woman's hot for you.

48:08.593 --> 48:11.357
What if she goes nuts
and tears your clothes off?

48:11.530 --> 48:15.432
That's what Craig Garfield said
Roxanne Doyle did.

48:16.201 --> 48:18.601
-Yeah, what do l do then?
-Call me.

48:18.770 --> 48:20.738
l can be there in 1 5 minutes.

48:23.108 --> 48:26.908
Wait, you can't call me.
ln fact, you can't come home.

48:28.280 --> 48:31.010
You'll have to sleep in the cave.

48:32.984 --> 48:35.282
The cave.

48:35.454 --> 48:38.184
Oh, God.

48:47.399 --> 48:50.766
l want to make a toast
to my good friend, Rick...

48:50.936 --> 48:53.962
...a guy with a great sense of humor.

48:54.139 --> 48:56.437
And here's to summer.

48:56.608 --> 49:00.442
l swear, sixth grade is so bogus,
it's a joke.

49:09.221 --> 49:13.089
Wanna take a walk?
l think they need some privacy.

49:13.258 --> 49:17.126
Jill, you animal, you.

49:17.295 --> 49:19.126
Come on.

49:21.666 --> 49:24.658
Hey, wait, where you going?

49:24.836 --> 49:26.804
Hey, man, don't leave me now.

49:31.209 --> 49:33.803
You kids have fun, huh?

49:35.580 --> 49:36.842
They left me.

49:37.015 --> 49:39.347
lt's okay, l'm still here.

49:40.151 --> 49:44.019
Sandy, you tricked me bad.

49:45.390 --> 49:49.417
You know, in five years,
Jill's going to make him very happy.

49:49.594 --> 49:51.721
Yeah, l'm sure.

49:53.532 --> 49:55.557
-Nice fire.
-Sandy, this is--

49:55.734 --> 49:56.723
Don't talk.

49:56.935 --> 49:59.233
Sandy, this is a big mistake.

50:00.138 --> 50:03.369
Maybe, maybe not.
There's only one way to find out.

50:03.542 --> 50:05.169
Sandy. Sandy, really.

50:05.343 --> 50:07.334
Sandy, get out of there!

50:10.482 --> 50:15.010
There really is
a very good explanation for that.

50:15.186 --> 50:16.380
l'm flattered.

50:17.322 --> 50:18.346
You are?

50:18.523 --> 50:20.889
But you don't have to do this
to impress me.

50:21.059 --> 50:23.186
-l don't?
-No.

50:23.361 --> 50:25.090
l like you a lot.

50:26.598 --> 50:28.532
l'll take one of those beers now.

50:28.700 --> 50:31.931
lt's okay. l mean, how small can it be?

50:32.771 --> 50:34.329
Don't ask.

50:34.973 --> 50:36.497
More cold duck?

50:36.675 --> 50:38.905
Sure, hit me again.

50:39.077 --> 50:41.773
lf l give you 5 bucks,
would you go see a movie?

50:41.947 --> 50:45.974
Terry promised she'd be home tonight.
l'm not leaving until l see her.

50:46.151 --> 50:49.245
lf l give you 1 0 bucks,
would you go wait in your car?

50:49.421 --> 50:53.187
We're on number 22.
Let's keep going.

50:56.795 --> 50:58.524
Bummer.

50:59.764 --> 51:02.733
''lf the coefficient of X
is greater than that of Y...

51:02.901 --> 51:06.462
...and the coefficient of Y
is greater than that of C...

51:06.638 --> 51:08.265
...then what can be said...

51:08.440 --> 51:11.967
...about the coefficient of X
in relation to the coefficient of C?''

51:24.122 --> 51:25.783
Hold it.

51:27.759 --> 51:30.023
lt's time Kevin knew the truth.

51:30.996 --> 51:35.524
Terry moved to Oregon to join a
religious cult she saw on 60 <i>Minute</i> s.

51:37.502 --> 51:39.800
lt's all in the letter.

51:41.106 --> 51:43.939
You should go home
and wait for her, Kevin.

51:44.109 --> 51:46.236
Wait, two more problems.

51:46.411 --> 51:48.845
-''lf the coefficient of--''
-Hi, Kevin.

51:49.280 --> 51:51.942
Terry, back from the cult.

51:52.117 --> 51:53.846
Where the hell have you been?

51:56.287 --> 51:58.619
You're gonna laugh.

51:59.491 --> 52:03.222
l was upstairs looking for this skirt...

52:03.561 --> 52:06.553
...and l fell asleep in the closet.

52:07.399 --> 52:09.230
What did you do to your hair?

52:10.235 --> 52:12.260
Oh, l cut it.

52:12.437 --> 52:15.167
-lsn't it cute?
-Cute? lt's gone!

52:16.274 --> 52:18.071
What are you, drunk?

52:20.045 --> 52:21.706
You are, you're drunk.

52:21.880 --> 52:24.872
What's going on here?
We're supposed to get together.

52:25.050 --> 52:30.317
Kevin. Honey. Angel.

52:32.424 --> 52:35.552
l'll make it up to you, l promise.

52:35.727 --> 52:37.718
When, tonight?

52:38.596 --> 52:41.030
-Let me tuck you in.
-l can't tonight.

52:41.199 --> 52:44.566
l'm working very hard on my article.

52:45.670 --> 52:47.433
But l'll tell you what.

52:49.074 --> 52:52.009
l'll walk you out to the car, okay?

52:52.844 --> 52:56.575
Gee, a walk to the car.
Talk about your wild nights.

52:57.215 --> 53:00.912
lt's okay, because while you were
up in the closet getting drunk...

53:01.086 --> 53:02.951
...l got to do algebra!

53:03.121 --> 53:05.851
That's wonderful.

53:08.693 --> 53:10.320
Crazy kids.

53:10.495 --> 53:13.259
Well, alone at last.

53:13.431 --> 53:15.626
Why are you smiling like that?

53:15.800 --> 53:17.461
Because it's party time!

53:17.635 --> 53:20.103
Let's dance! Let's great crazy!

53:20.271 --> 53:23.240
Let's get drunk! Let's get naked!

53:23.408 --> 53:27.037
Buddy, l love a good party,
but something about you worries me.

53:27.212 --> 53:28.440
Linda, you're a nut.

53:28.613 --> 53:31.411
Skinny dip in the pool,
back rub in the bedroom?

53:31.583 --> 53:34.245
Pick a sin, any sin.

53:34.419 --> 53:36.387
lt's getting kind of late.

53:36.554 --> 53:38.385
No, it's early.

53:38.923 --> 53:40.652
-Bye.
-Linda, wait.

53:40.825 --> 53:42.759
For God's sake, l vacuumed, Linda!

53:42.927 --> 53:44.656
Buddy, you're a nice guy.

53:44.829 --> 53:47.957
No, not a nice guy.
That's the kiss of death.

53:48.133 --> 53:50.624
l'll see you in algebra.
Thanks for your help.

53:50.802 --> 53:52.099
Linda, wait!

53:52.270 --> 53:56.263
Would it make any difference at all
if l said l was hung like a bear?

53:56.441 --> 53:58.136
lt might. Are you?

53:59.277 --> 54:01.871
No, just checking.

54:02.046 --> 54:04.241
Goodbye, Buddy.

54:05.583 --> 54:08.313
l like your hair.

54:11.356 --> 54:14.848
That girl had incredible self-control.

54:15.293 --> 54:18.319
Kevin hates me, Rick hates me.

54:18.496 --> 54:21.124
Everybody hates me except Sandy.

54:21.299 --> 54:23.733
Oh, yeah, how'd it go?
Did you get laid?

54:23.902 --> 54:26.530
l bet l came closer than you did.

54:26.704 --> 54:31.698
Years from now, Linda will look back
on this night and be very sorry.

54:34.078 --> 54:35.943
Good night, Buddy.

54:37.215 --> 54:39.513
Sorry, Spike.

54:41.753 --> 54:43.482
Nothing much, Ma.

54:43.655 --> 54:45.316
l did good on my history test.

54:45.490 --> 54:47.185
Terry's become a transsexual.

54:47.358 --> 54:49.656
She's starting to grow hair
on her chest.

54:49.828 --> 54:50.988
Yeah, just a second.

54:51.162 --> 54:53.187
Hey, Mom wants to talk to you.

54:55.233 --> 54:56.632
She can't talk, Mom.

54:56.801 --> 54:58.826
The doctor advised her
not to speak.

54:59.003 --> 55:01.733
Something hormonal and vocal.

55:01.906 --> 55:03.567
Besides, she's hung-over.

55:03.741 --> 55:05.936
Yeah, she was out drinking
with the guys.

55:06.110 --> 55:08.374
Okay, see you in a week.

55:08.546 --> 55:10.514
We miss you too.

55:10.682 --> 55:12.650
Okay, bye.

55:13.084 --> 55:15.382
She thought l was kidding.

55:16.454 --> 55:18.479
Yo, Rick!

55:20.792 --> 55:21.884
Hi, Terry.

55:22.060 --> 55:25.154
-Good morning, Mrs. Morehouse.
-Rick, Terry's here.

55:32.570 --> 55:35.266
-Sorry about last night.
-Hey, that's okay.

55:35.440 --> 55:38.637
lf l was in the sixth grade,
l would have had a big night.

55:38.810 --> 55:40.903
-Come on, we're going out.
-Let me guess.

55:41.446 --> 55:44.677
You got me a hot date
with Sandy's grandmother.

55:44.849 --> 55:47.113
No, listen,
l figured the whole thing out.

55:47.285 --> 55:51.051
There is nothing wrong with you
except for the way you dress.

55:51.222 --> 55:55.124
Terry, it took me an hour
to put this look together.

55:55.293 --> 55:57.784
Yeah, so don't try so hard
next time. Come on.

55:57.962 --> 55:59.224
l don't have any money.

55:59.397 --> 56:02.298
l've got plastic.
You can pay me back.

56:05.336 --> 56:07.270
l just feel kind of weird.

56:07.438 --> 56:09.929
That's because your body's
not used to style.

56:10.108 --> 56:11.803
You'll adjust.

56:11.976 --> 56:13.534
Hey, Deborah, what's shaking?

56:13.711 --> 56:14.837
Hi, Terry.

56:15.013 --> 56:16.913
-Hi.
-Rick.

56:17.081 --> 56:18.776
Yeah, l know.

56:18.950 --> 56:20.713
You look a little different.

56:20.885 --> 56:23.353
Kid went shopping, got a haircut.

56:23.521 --> 56:25.250
Welcome to the '80s.

56:25.423 --> 56:28.256
-Very sharp.
-Thanks.

56:28.426 --> 56:31.862
Deb, what are you doing hanging
around these chump stains?

56:32.030 --> 56:34.328
-Come on, let's go.
-l'll be right there.

56:34.499 --> 56:37.935
-Now, Deborah.
-Just a second.

56:41.272 --> 56:44.571
Greg just likes to act tough.
He doesn't really hate you guys.

56:44.742 --> 56:48.303
Oh, that's no act.
He truly hates us.

56:49.047 --> 56:50.912
Deep down, he's insecure.

56:51.082 --> 56:53.778
Yeah, well, upfront he's an asshole.

56:54.519 --> 56:57.215
Take it easy, Deborah.

56:59.624 --> 57:02.923
What was that, a pity stop?

57:25.550 --> 57:28.417
lt's just about showtime, boys.

57:39.731 --> 57:41.858
l'm picking up curious life readings.

57:42.033 --> 57:43.660
-ls it human?
-Unknown.

57:43.835 --> 57:46.702
lt seems to be some sort of
carbon-based douche bag.

57:52.176 --> 57:55.077
Gentlemen, relax. Sit down.

57:55.246 --> 57:58.647
Too much stress,
it's not good for your muscles.

58:00.118 --> 58:02.586
Have a nice lunch.

58:07.759 --> 58:09.886
Hey, how you doing?

58:10.061 --> 58:11.528
Nice jacket.

58:13.698 --> 58:17.361
Oh, l'm sorry. Spaghetti too.

58:17.535 --> 58:19.503
l think it stains.

58:30.048 --> 58:31.349
Did l miss something?

58:31.349 --> 58:32.976
Did l miss something?

58:33.751 --> 58:35.878
Why didn't you slug
that asshole anyway?

58:36.054 --> 58:39.490
-He said he was sorry.
-And you believe him?

58:40.425 --> 58:42.256
Benefit of the doubt.

58:42.427 --> 58:45.863
Besides, the guy can lift cars.

58:46.697 --> 58:49.962
-What are you doing?
-What's it look like l'm doing?

58:51.002 --> 58:52.833
Do you have to do that in here?

58:53.004 --> 58:56.667
Felt like the right time,
certainly the right place.

58:56.841 --> 58:59.207
Terry, is this a problem for you?

59:00.211 --> 59:02.645
No, no problem at all.

59:02.814 --> 59:05.146
l was just kidding.

59:07.952 --> 59:11.888
lt's just that you look so nice today.

59:12.790 --> 59:14.781
You were perfect.

59:17.762 --> 59:21.027
Hey, isn't this great?

59:21.199 --> 59:22.962
lsn't what great?

59:23.134 --> 59:26.035
Well, you know, here we are...

59:26.204 --> 59:29.662
...a couple of guys
hanging out in the men's room...

59:29.841 --> 59:35.040
...leaning up against the urinals,
talking about broads and fights.

59:35.213 --> 59:38.307
Just like a couple of guys, you know?

59:38.483 --> 59:41.247
This is what you call
typical male bonding.

59:41.419 --> 59:45.617
You know, like <i>Butch Ca</i> ss <i>i</i> d <i>y</i>
<i>an</i> d <i>the</i> S <i>un</i> d <i>ance Ki</i> d.

59:45.790 --> 59:50.454
So that's what it is. Yeah, that's great.
l'm glad you told me.

59:50.628 --> 59:54.359
l just wish that Greg Tolan
would join the gang.

59:54.532 --> 59:56.762
Oh, man, l've had it with that jerk.

59:56.934 --> 01:00:00.836
You want to know about Greg Tolan?
l'll tell you about Greg Tolan.

01:00:01.005 --> 01:00:04.406
Greg Tolan is toast.

01:00:05.243 --> 01:00:08.076
He can't get away with this.
We gotta get him back.

01:00:08.246 --> 01:00:09.804
We and what army?

01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:13.747
No violence.
No need to sink to his level.

01:00:13.918 --> 01:00:18.821
You see, we have something
that Greg Tolan will never have:

01:00:19.557 --> 01:00:20.854
lntelligence.

01:00:21.959 --> 01:00:23.620
You know, you're right.

01:00:23.794 --> 01:00:27.321
l mean, we're smart.
Okay, Terry, what do we do?

01:00:27.632 --> 01:00:31.466
-l don't know.
-Me neither. Oh, boy.

01:00:37.642 --> 01:00:39.701
Hey, man, this stuff will kill you.

01:00:39.877 --> 01:00:42.345
Try this, you'll live longer.

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:46.013
Thanks.

01:00:46.484 --> 01:00:47.815
Looks good.

01:00:47.985 --> 01:00:50.852
-l made it myself.
-Gonna finish those fries?

01:00:51.022 --> 01:00:52.284
-Buddy?
-Thanks.

01:00:52.456 --> 01:00:55.823
-What are you doing here?
-Looking for you.

01:00:56.861 --> 01:00:59.853
Rick, this my younger brother,
Buddy.

01:01:00.031 --> 01:01:01.692
How you doing?

01:01:01.866 --> 01:01:05.324
So this is Rick?

01:01:05.636 --> 01:01:07.627
l've heard a lot about you.

01:01:08.539 --> 01:01:10.234
A lot.

01:01:10.408 --> 01:01:11.898
Buddy, what do you want?

01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:15.638
Guess who came by to pick you up
for school this morning?

01:01:15.813 --> 01:01:17.041
Your true love.

01:01:18.416 --> 01:01:22.546
Kevina. Kevina was very upset
that you left without her.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:27.680
You know how she worships your
rippling muscles and your hairy chest.

01:01:28.359 --> 01:01:31.226
Terry's such a stallion.

01:01:31.696 --> 01:01:33.254
Go on.

01:01:33.464 --> 01:01:34.863
Show him your hairy chest.

01:01:35.833 --> 01:01:37.357
Buddy.

01:01:38.202 --> 01:01:41.763
Anyway, Kevina made me promise
to tell you she's picking you up...

01:01:41.939 --> 01:01:44.271
...for dinner 7:30 sharp.

01:01:44.609 --> 01:01:47.237
So you should
look your handsomest.

01:01:48.346 --> 01:01:50.746
Thanks for the message, Bud.

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:53.948
My pleasure.

01:01:54.151 --> 01:01:55.846
Well...

01:01:56.787 --> 01:01:59.688
...l'm gonna scope out
the local babes.

01:02:01.492 --> 01:02:03.824
Hey, Rick, stay real.

01:02:03.995 --> 01:02:05.724
Take it easy.

01:02:06.764 --> 01:02:09.790
You have a girlfriend
named Kevina?

01:02:09.967 --> 01:02:13.528
-Rather exotic, isn't it?
-Stallion.

01:02:31.222 --> 01:02:32.814
Hi.

01:02:33.891 --> 01:02:35.950
Can l be totally honest with you?

01:02:36.127 --> 01:02:39.654
Your touch is the reason
why l went through puberty.

01:02:43.567 --> 01:02:45.194
Sit down.

01:02:46.737 --> 01:02:51.265
Guys, l just want to apologize
about neglecting you yesterday.

01:02:51.442 --> 01:02:56.379
l felt terrible, and l just want you
to know you're still my favorite.

01:02:57.948 --> 01:02:59.575
Sit down.

01:03:00.518 --> 01:03:03.612
Man, Terry,
this crap has gotta stop.

01:03:03.788 --> 01:03:05.551
What are you gonna do?

01:03:07.358 --> 01:03:08.620
Excuse me.

01:03:08.793 --> 01:03:12.058
Can l have your attention, please?
Your attention?

01:03:15.533 --> 01:03:17.194
Every day at lunch...

01:03:17.368 --> 01:03:20.565
...we get a very special treat...

01:03:20.738 --> 01:03:22.831
...from a very special guy.

01:03:23.007 --> 01:03:26.534
A guy who has dedicated his life...

01:03:26.711 --> 01:03:28.303
...to building his body...

01:03:28.612 --> 01:03:32.207
...pushing his muscles
to the very limits of human endurance.

01:03:32.383 --> 01:03:34.943
Why, you ask? Why?

01:03:35.119 --> 01:03:40.182
Well, to be strong enough to lift tables
and spill food. Greg Tolan!

01:03:47.431 --> 01:03:49.365
Whoa, wait.

01:03:50.234 --> 01:03:52.759
Let's take a moment now
to find out a little bit...

01:03:52.937 --> 01:03:55.997
...about the man behind the mask.

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:58.401
Greg. May l call you Greg?

01:03:58.576 --> 01:04:04.242
Now tell us, Greg, how did you
first get into spilling food?

01:04:04.415 --> 01:04:06.474
Were you a messy baby?

01:04:08.486 --> 01:04:10.147
Did you hate your strained peas?

01:04:11.822 --> 01:04:15.280
Well, you know, most psychologists
tell us that guys...

01:04:15.459 --> 01:04:20.226
...well, they get into bodybuilding to
compensate for either a lack of lQ...

01:04:20.398 --> 01:04:21.763
...or a small wienie.

01:04:22.133 --> 01:04:23.794
Which is it, Greg?

01:04:23.968 --> 01:04:27.995
Well, those of us
in Greg's gym class...

01:04:28.172 --> 01:04:31.437
...certainly know the answer
to that one.

01:04:31.842 --> 01:04:34.003
l'm gonna beat the shit out of you!

01:04:34.178 --> 01:04:35.770
Greg, please!

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:41.213
Hey, isn't he great?
Muscles and a sense of humor!

01:04:44.088 --> 01:04:48.286
Well, let's all thank Greg for the many
lunchtime thrills and spills...

01:04:48.459 --> 01:04:51.860
...he's given us. All right, everybody,
up! Come on, everybody, up!

01:04:52.029 --> 01:04:53.758
Grab the end of your tables!

01:04:53.931 --> 01:04:56.058
A tribute to you, Greg.

01:04:56.233 --> 01:04:58.133
Lift!

01:05:04.074 --> 01:05:05.905
We love you, Greg.

01:05:06.076 --> 01:05:09.603
Everybody out! Go on outside!

01:05:11.649 --> 01:05:12.911
Now!

01:05:13.083 --> 01:05:16.211
-Hold it, clown!
-Come on, Greg. Greg, not now.

01:05:16.387 --> 01:05:18.821
lt was a joke, people laughed.
Let it slide.

01:05:18.989 --> 01:05:21.423
-Stay out of this.
-l am getting real bored...

01:05:21.592 --> 01:05:23.719
-...watching you push people around.
-Yeah?

01:05:23.894 --> 01:05:27.261
-Stick around, it'll get real exciting.
-You know, Terry was right.

01:05:27.431 --> 01:05:30.229
-You are an asshole.
-That asshole called me an asshole?

01:05:30.401 --> 01:05:33.996
-Oh, now you wanna beat him up too?
-No, l wanna buy him an ice cream.

01:05:46.484 --> 01:05:49.317
Can't you ever just be man enough
to walk away?

01:05:49.487 --> 01:05:52.149
Watch, l'll show you how it's done.

01:05:54.625 --> 01:05:56.718
You got some pudding on your shoes.

01:05:56.994 --> 01:05:59.296
You were outstanding! Phenomenal!
So who you gonna ask?

01:05:59.296 --> 01:06:00.285
You were outstanding! Phenomenal!
So who you gonna ask?

01:06:00.464 --> 01:06:02.989
-Don't start this.
-You're practically a celebrity.

01:06:03.167 --> 01:06:05.863
l'm having a really great day.
Please, don't spoil it.

01:06:06.036 --> 01:06:07.867
We've gone too far to stop now.

01:06:08.038 --> 01:06:12.975
Just ask one more person, anybody.
And then l swear l'll shut up.

01:06:16.146 --> 01:06:19.081
-Anybody?
-Anybody.

01:06:27.291 --> 01:06:29.088
This is....

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:32.556
This is gonna sound crazy, but...

01:06:32.730 --> 01:06:35.597
...what the heck, you know,
it's been a crazy day.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.491
Would you like to go with me
to the prom?

01:06:39.570 --> 01:06:41.435
Yeah, l'd love to.

01:06:43.007 --> 01:06:45.066
l don't think you
understood the question--

01:06:45.242 --> 01:06:48.734
The prom?
l'd love to be your date.

01:06:53.083 --> 01:06:54.846
Hi, Terry.

01:06:56.253 --> 01:06:58.551
l'm going with Deborah?

01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:04.389
l'm going with Deborah.

01:07:06.397 --> 01:07:08.763
That's really wonderful.

01:07:08.933 --> 01:07:10.696
See, what did l tell you?

01:07:10.868 --> 01:07:12.392
You're a great guy.

01:07:12.736 --> 01:07:17.002
lt's about time
some lucky girl figured it out.

01:07:17.174 --> 01:07:20.575
-Let's double. Who you going with?
-Oh, l don't know if l'm going.

01:07:20.778 --> 01:07:23.406
You've got to, come on. Sandy.

01:07:23.581 --> 01:07:25.776
Oh, no way, man,
that chick is dangerous.

01:07:25.950 --> 01:07:28.111
-l don't need to go.
-Yes, you do.

01:07:28.285 --> 01:07:30.378
After all you've done for me...

01:07:30.688 --> 01:07:32.781
...we've gotta get you a date.

01:07:33.724 --> 01:07:37.387
Because, Terry, l'm not going
unless you're going too.

01:07:37.561 --> 01:07:40.257
l mean it, l'll tell Deborah right now.

01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:45.198
l think l know who to ask.

01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:48.194
Okay!

01:07:51.909 --> 01:07:55.310
l was wondering, do you have plans
yet for Saturday night?

01:07:55.546 --> 01:07:57.377
l'm not sure.

01:07:57.915 --> 01:08:00.907
Either l'm jetting to Paris...

01:08:01.085 --> 01:08:03.383
...or watching <i>The L</i> o <i>ve B</i> o <i>at</i>.

01:08:07.491 --> 01:08:09.220
Denise.

01:08:11.328 --> 01:08:13.762
Will you be my date at the prom?

01:08:14.531 --> 01:08:17.398
You are so sexually confused.

01:08:17.568 --> 01:08:21.868
-Please, just say you'll go with me.
-Why would you wanna go?

01:08:22.038 --> 01:08:24.234
Because l promised Rick.

01:08:24.408 --> 01:08:27.809
And if l don't go,
he won't go with Deborah.

01:08:29.013 --> 01:08:32.005
Deborah. l am such a jerk.

01:08:32.282 --> 01:08:34.773
l thought the whole point
was to get Rick a date.

01:08:35.118 --> 01:08:38.350
Yeah, but not her. l mean,
what could he possibly see in her?

01:08:38.522 --> 01:08:40.956
-She's totally wrong for him.
-Too pretty?

01:08:41.125 --> 01:08:43.184
No, she's trouble.

01:08:44.028 --> 01:08:47.828
l guess Rick needs someone
a lot more sensitive.

01:08:47.997 --> 01:08:50.694
More like you, right?

01:08:50.868 --> 01:08:54.429
Why would l want Rick
when l have Kevin?

01:08:55.072 --> 01:08:56.334
Good question.

01:08:56.506 --> 01:08:59.032
But do you like him?

01:08:59.209 --> 01:09:01.609
Rick's not my type at all.

01:09:01.779 --> 01:09:04.077
Sure, with my help,
he's come a long way.

01:09:04.247 --> 01:09:07.479
He's stopped buying his clothes
at Nerds 'R' Us.

01:09:07.850 --> 01:09:10.786
l know you, Terry, and you like him.

01:09:11.988 --> 01:09:13.649
He's research.

01:09:13.823 --> 01:09:17.020
My article's due Monday,
l've got a lot of good stuff.

01:09:17.194 --> 01:09:21.153
But l still need something
to tie it all together.

01:09:21.932 --> 01:09:24.024
Yeah, you like him.

01:09:25.502 --> 01:09:27.197
Denise.

01:09:28.971 --> 01:09:31.566
Just say you'll go
to the prom with me.

01:09:31.942 --> 01:09:36.106
-l'll go to the prom with you.
-Oh, thank you.

01:09:37.281 --> 01:09:40.078
l want a limo.
And you can't tell anyone.

01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:43.515
Not my friends, not my parents,
no one. Deal?

01:09:43.687 --> 01:09:45.951
Look, l'm not proud of this either.

01:09:46.122 --> 01:09:49.456
God, look how low l've sunk.
And you know what's really sad is...

01:09:49.626 --> 01:09:52.527
...you're the best date
l've had in weeks.

01:09:53.796 --> 01:09:56.129
-How do l look?
-Beautiful.

01:09:56.567 --> 01:09:59.001
Kevin really loves this outfit.

01:09:59.169 --> 01:10:01.603
l wanna look really nice for him.

01:10:01.839 --> 01:10:05.400
l guess you two haven't
had much time together...

01:10:05.576 --> 01:10:07.134
...since...

01:10:07.311 --> 01:10:09.677
...the sex change.

01:10:10.013 --> 01:10:11.913
That's cute.

01:10:19.890 --> 01:10:23.587
Hey, Denise, what's your rush?
We're young, we're wild.

01:10:23.761 --> 01:10:25.888
Let's be young and wild together.

01:10:26.063 --> 01:10:29.464
l'd rather get the phone book
and pick a name at random.

01:10:30.634 --> 01:10:33.000
Hi, is Terry home?

01:10:33.170 --> 01:10:34.899
Yeah, come on in.

01:10:35.239 --> 01:10:38.970
-Hey, Terry, you got company.
-Come on up, l'm almost ready.

01:10:39.543 --> 01:10:42.944
Hey, we could go to your place,
it's cool. l'm very flexible.

01:10:51.155 --> 01:10:53.555
-Oh, shit.
-Terry?

01:10:53.724 --> 01:10:55.385
Don't come in, l'm dressing.

01:11:00.197 --> 01:11:01.459
Ter?

01:11:01.999 --> 01:11:03.830
l'll be right out.

01:11:20.717 --> 01:11:22.912
Hey, Sandy, what a nice surprise.

01:11:23.086 --> 01:11:25.486
These are for you.
They're kissing fish.

01:11:25.656 --> 01:11:28.056
To say sorry about the cave.

01:11:28.225 --> 01:11:31.023
Yeah, l'm sorry too.

01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:35.864
-How did you know where l lived?
-l followed you.

01:11:36.033 --> 01:11:37.432
Why don't you go to Pearl?

01:11:38.101 --> 01:11:40.535
Oh, l hate that school.

01:11:40.704 --> 01:11:42.262
Bunch of snotty rich kids.

01:11:42.439 --> 01:11:45.602
Anyway, thanks for the fish.
l'll put them by my bed.

01:11:45.776 --> 01:11:49.371
-That's perfect. ls that your room?
-No, it's my little brother's room.

01:11:49.546 --> 01:11:52.208
-That's my room over there.
-Let's see how they look.

01:11:52.916 --> 01:11:54.713
Help me.

01:12:01.458 --> 01:12:03.392
l think they'll look good over here.

01:12:04.995 --> 01:12:08.988
Like, this is where you sleep
and do your homework?

01:12:09.266 --> 01:12:13.202
Yeah, well, l like pictures of people.

01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:15.736
Terry loves tits and ass.

01:12:15.906 --> 01:12:18.067
These women
just aren't tits and ass.

01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:21.337
Kim reads Vonnegut.

01:12:21.511 --> 01:12:26.676
And Luanne,
Luanne despises toxic waste.

01:12:26.850 --> 01:12:30.877
Don't let him fool you,
hardcore sex maniac.

01:12:31.054 --> 01:12:33.852
Well, Terry treated me
with nothing but respect.

01:12:34.858 --> 01:12:36.519
Very special.

01:12:36.693 --> 01:12:40.959
Yeah, he's one of a kind, my bro.

01:12:41.598 --> 01:12:44.795
Hey, l wonder
if that could be your pal, Kevin.

01:12:44.968 --> 01:12:49.337
Yeah, Kevin. Why don't you go
downstairs and tell Kevin...

01:12:49.506 --> 01:12:53.033
...l'm not quite ready and could he
please wait for me in the car.

01:12:53.477 --> 01:12:57.208
l tried that once.
He doesn't like waiting in cars.

01:13:01.518 --> 01:13:05.249
Thanks for stopping by, but
as you can see, l really am in a rush.

01:13:05.422 --> 01:13:07.856
First there's something else
l have to give you.

01:13:08.458 --> 01:13:11.791
-Nothing could top these fish.
-Don't be so sure.

01:13:13.397 --> 01:13:17.993
Oh, my God, the fish! Were they fed
today? Look at those hungry eyes.

01:13:18.168 --> 01:13:19.533
They're kissing.

01:13:19.703 --> 01:13:21.432
They're turning cannibal.

01:13:21.605 --> 01:13:25.735
Here. Feed them this, and l'll see
what l have in the kitchen.

01:13:30.447 --> 01:13:32.312
You guys like pizza?

01:13:40.157 --> 01:13:42.591
Buddy! Kevin!

01:13:42.759 --> 01:13:44.226
Here she is.

01:13:44.394 --> 01:13:47.989
-What are you doing here so early?
-lt's 7:30, l'm right on time.

01:13:48.165 --> 01:13:51.566
Seven-thirty? l could have sworn
you said 8:30.

01:13:51.735 --> 01:13:55.171
l'll tell you what, l'll go get ready,
and you come back in an hour.

01:13:55.339 --> 01:13:58.001
Terry, you know damn well
l said 7:30.

01:13:58.175 --> 01:14:01.736
You said you'd be ready
and dressed to kill.

01:14:02.312 --> 01:14:05.406
So why do you look like hell?

01:14:09.686 --> 01:14:11.210
l don't know.

01:14:11.388 --> 01:14:13.788
Buddy, can l see you for a minute?

01:14:16.693 --> 01:14:19.025
''l don't know''?
You're so great under pressure.

01:14:19.196 --> 01:14:23.064
Listen, a half-naked woman's in your
room feeding the fish. She's all yours.

01:14:23.233 --> 01:14:26.725
-Sounds too kinky for me.
-Budster, l need you. She needs you.

01:14:26.903 --> 01:14:29.701
-You need her.
-ls she really half-naked?

01:14:29.873 --> 01:14:31.807
-Maybe more now.
-What if you're lying?

01:14:31.975 --> 01:14:33.602
-What if l'm not?
-Good point.

01:14:33.777 --> 01:14:36.268
lf l'm not back in a week,
forward my mail.

01:14:42.185 --> 01:14:44.119
Kevin, darling!

01:14:51.661 --> 01:14:53.322
Hello.

01:14:54.398 --> 01:14:55.729
Where's Terry?

01:14:56.733 --> 01:15:01.500
Gone. This isn't the first time
that androgynous sleaze-bucket...

01:15:01.671 --> 01:15:04.162
...has broken
a beautiful girl's heart.

01:15:04.341 --> 01:15:06.309
l am so embarrassed.

01:15:06.476 --> 01:15:09.639
Why? The room's full
of naked women.

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:13.982
Wait, would you feel more comfortable
if l took my shirt off?

01:15:17.054 --> 01:15:19.113
What a nice girl.

01:15:21.291 --> 01:15:24.124
We can't go to Giovanni's
with you dressed like that.

01:15:24.294 --> 01:15:26.023
Sure we can. We'll get it to go.

01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:28.796
A long time ago l knew
this girl named Terry...

01:15:28.965 --> 01:15:31.763
...she wore dresses and makeup.

01:15:31.968 --> 01:15:33.936
She was hot.

01:15:34.204 --> 01:15:36.604
Then one day she disappeared.

01:15:36.907 --> 01:15:38.636
Do you know where she went?

01:15:38.809 --> 01:15:42.404
She's right here.
You know, l'm still the same person.

01:15:42.679 --> 01:15:44.943
And is that all you care about,
that l'm hot?

01:15:45.115 --> 01:15:47.310
No, that's not all l care about.

01:15:47.484 --> 01:15:50.351
Look, l'm under pressure,
my article's due Monday.

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:55.389
What is it with this article? lt's nice
to have a hobby, but let's get serious.

01:15:55.959 --> 01:15:57.984
A hobby?

01:15:58.161 --> 01:16:00.493
l didn't mean...

01:16:00.664 --> 01:16:04.031
...hobby like just a hobby, l....

01:16:04.501 --> 01:16:08.369
l meant hobby
like an important hobby.

01:16:21.818 --> 01:16:23.080
Well...

01:16:23.253 --> 01:16:25.619
-...how do l look?
-Dashing.

01:16:25.789 --> 01:16:27.256
My zipper's open.

01:16:27.457 --> 01:16:29.857
That was the dashing part.

01:16:30.894 --> 01:16:33.795
-Budmeister, are you okay?
-No, Terry, l'm not.

01:16:34.564 --> 01:16:36.623
Mom and Dad come home Monday.

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:39.200
l've had two weeks of total freedom.

01:16:39.369 --> 01:16:44.671
The closest l've come to sex was a girl
who took her top off to seduce you.

01:16:44.841 --> 01:16:46.604
What's wrong with me?

01:16:47.544 --> 01:16:49.409
Not a thing.

01:16:49.579 --> 01:16:52.070
Listen, sex is not that big a deal.

01:16:52.549 --> 01:16:54.517
l'd like to form my own opinion.

01:16:54.784 --> 01:16:57.082
lt'll happen.

01:16:57.521 --> 01:16:59.489
l know this place that delivers.

01:16:59.823 --> 01:17:02.053
Massage Delight or something.

01:17:02.225 --> 01:17:04.090
Can l borrow $200?

01:17:04.861 --> 01:17:08.422
Buddy, why don't you just call up
the guys and go to the mall?

01:17:08.632 --> 01:17:11.533
l'd rather wallow in my virginity.

01:17:15.605 --> 01:17:18.335
Buddy, you know l can't answer it.

01:17:19.009 --> 01:17:21.637
Please, this is almost over.

01:17:27.450 --> 01:17:29.247
Yeah?

01:17:29.953 --> 01:17:33.855
Yeah, Terry's here.
l'll see if it can talk.

01:17:34.691 --> 01:17:36.921
lt's Mr. Wonderful.

01:17:40.463 --> 01:17:42.454
Hi, Kevin.

01:17:43.133 --> 01:17:45.294
No, l can't tonight.

01:17:46.603 --> 01:17:49.936
Listen, we have to have
a serious talk.

01:17:50.507 --> 01:17:53.067
Yes, it's about us.

01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:57.238
Listen, can we talk about this
later? l gotta go--

01:17:58.348 --> 01:18:00.111
Bye, Kevin.

01:18:02.419 --> 01:18:05.183
Mr. Wonderful is Mr. History?

01:18:08.758 --> 01:18:10.953
All right.

01:19:54.331 --> 01:19:57.698
l'm having such a good time,
no one here knows l used to be fat.

01:20:01.037 --> 01:20:04.700
Tell me again how Rick
and Deborah belong together.

01:20:04.874 --> 01:20:09.004
-Rick and Deborah belong together.
-What a crock!

01:20:14.017 --> 01:20:16.349
He's doing it again,
he keeps giving me looks!

01:20:42.879 --> 01:20:46.212
Thank you, you're very special.
We'll be right back.

01:20:46.483 --> 01:20:48.781
He wants to talk to me,
do you mind if l go?

01:20:48.952 --> 01:20:51.944
-No, really, go ahead.
-You're a great date.

01:20:56.626 --> 01:20:58.423
Hey, Sandy.

01:20:59.129 --> 01:21:03.498
About the other night, l feel like
a visitor from the planet of the sluts.

01:21:03.666 --> 01:21:05.930
Hey, that's okay.

01:21:07.504 --> 01:21:09.972
We all make mistakes.

01:21:12.842 --> 01:21:14.605
Hi, Deb.

01:21:15.645 --> 01:21:17.442
Greg.

01:21:19.582 --> 01:21:21.311
<i>Y</i> o <i>u</i>'<i>re</i> d <i>ea</i> d.

01:21:26.456 --> 01:21:30.415
-Can l help you?
-Yeah, parsley for eight, please.

01:21:32.362 --> 01:21:34.956
-They're so cute.
-Yeah.

01:21:35.698 --> 01:21:38.633
-l don't think they're hungry.
-Hi.

01:21:38.868 --> 01:21:41.894
They really do prefer
mealworms or flies.

01:21:48.578 --> 01:21:50.569
How could she do that to you?

01:21:50.747 --> 01:21:52.806
We don't have a real commitment.

01:21:52.982 --> 01:21:57.385
-She can date whoever she wants.
-ln the middle of the prom?

01:22:00.423 --> 01:22:02.323
Oh, there you are.

01:22:03.927 --> 01:22:06.487
He's so excited, it's his first prom.

01:22:15.305 --> 01:22:16.932
Terry?

01:22:17.774 --> 01:22:20.834
-All right, where is she?
-lt's that darn cult again.

01:22:21.010 --> 01:22:23.672
They have her totally brainwashed.

01:22:24.113 --> 01:22:28.516
-Wanna split her records?
-Tell me now or tell me in the hospital!

01:22:28.685 --> 01:22:30.880
l'm suddenly remembering.

01:22:31.154 --> 01:22:34.885
lf l tell you where she is,
you gotta take me with you.

01:22:35.058 --> 01:22:37.117
l don't want to miss this.

01:22:37.594 --> 01:22:39.289
-Let's go.
-Wait.

01:22:39.462 --> 01:22:42.727
lt's kind of formal, l've gotta change.

01:22:49.839 --> 01:22:52.399
Thank you. Thank you.

01:22:52.575 --> 01:22:55.908
Well, as chairwoman of the prom
committee, it's now my pleasure...

01:22:56.079 --> 01:22:59.105
...to announce
your prom king and queen.

01:22:59.282 --> 01:23:01.512
The envelopes, please.

01:23:01.885 --> 01:23:03.284
Thank you.

01:23:03.453 --> 01:23:07.913
Ladies and gentlemen,
this year's prom queen is--

01:23:09.325 --> 01:23:11.486
Deborah Strowbridge.

01:23:15.532 --> 01:23:18.433
Hey, l swear to God, l'm not lying.

01:23:18.601 --> 01:23:24.540
Okay, all right,
and this year's prom king is:

01:23:26.876 --> 01:23:29.902
-lt's Greg Tolan.
-Yeah.

01:23:31.147 --> 01:23:33.775
All right, Greg! Way to go, Greg.

01:23:33.950 --> 01:23:36.350
Congratulations, Greg.

01:23:36.519 --> 01:23:38.510
Thank you, Deborah.

01:23:41.324 --> 01:23:44.191
You know,
now that l take a good look...

01:23:44.727 --> 01:23:47.719
-...they do make a nice couple.
-Normally we have a traditional...

01:23:47.897 --> 01:23:51.833
...king and queen's dance, but as
chairwoman of the prom committee...

01:23:52.001 --> 01:23:54.333
...l've decided that
that's a stupid tradition.

01:23:55.138 --> 01:23:57.436
So everybody dance!

01:24:11.588 --> 01:24:13.317
Come on, Rick.

01:24:38.481 --> 01:24:40.278
May l cut in?

01:24:43.987 --> 01:24:45.614
Tolan, you're a creep.

01:24:45.955 --> 01:24:47.445
You son of a bitch!

01:24:51.527 --> 01:24:54.052
l'm gonna scratch your eyes out!

01:25:07.477 --> 01:25:08.842
Help!

01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:14.243
You dumb ox, you're in trouble!

01:25:14.984 --> 01:25:16.144
Help me!

01:25:16.319 --> 01:25:19.720
Put me down! Put me down!

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:39.702
Shit, where did these guys
learn to fight?

01:25:50.553 --> 01:25:53.420
Okay, tough guy,
you want a piece of me now?

01:25:53.589 --> 01:25:55.352
My back's not turned the other way.

01:25:56.325 --> 01:25:58.987
-Nice tux, you'll look good buried in it.
-Come on.

01:26:19.115 --> 01:26:20.844
No pain, no gain.

01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:36.125
Hey, Ter.

01:26:36.299 --> 01:26:38.324
-Buddy.
-l missed you.

01:26:38.501 --> 01:26:41.629
-Terry, are you all right?
-Kevin?

01:26:41.804 --> 01:26:43.294
Hey, Sandy!

01:26:43.473 --> 01:26:45.805
What are you doing here,
in a tuxedo?

01:26:45.975 --> 01:26:48.535
Please go home, l'll call you tonight.

01:26:50.179 --> 01:26:53.307
-Who is this guy?
-Terry's boyfriend, who are you?

01:26:53.483 --> 01:26:54.916
Just a friend.

01:26:55.251 --> 01:26:57.583
We can work this out.
l know you still love me.

01:26:57.754 --> 01:27:00.188
No, l don't. l love someone else.

01:27:00.423 --> 01:27:03.950
-Whoa, thanks, but no, thanks.
-Look, we belong together. You're my--

01:27:04.127 --> 01:27:08.188
Hold that thought. Can l talk to you for
one brief moment? l'll be right back.

01:27:10.133 --> 01:27:13.864
-What's going on?
-Wait, it gets better.

01:27:20.042 --> 01:27:21.873
Yeah, big night, huh?

01:27:22.979 --> 01:27:27.313
-l bet you're a little confused.
-l think l understand.

01:27:28.417 --> 01:27:31.318
l know l should have
told you sooner, but...

01:27:31.487 --> 01:27:33.148
...l didn't.

01:27:34.323 --> 01:27:37.121
-l'm a--
-Terry, l know.

01:27:37.293 --> 01:27:39.158
You're gay.

01:27:39.562 --> 01:27:40.995
l'm not gay.

01:27:44.433 --> 01:27:46.560
Wait a minute, now l'm confused.

01:27:48.738 --> 01:27:52.071
l'm a girl. l'm a woman.

01:27:53.176 --> 01:27:55.406
Right, and l'm Cyndi Lauper.

01:27:55.578 --> 01:27:57.671
Could we please go back
to the prom now?

01:27:57.847 --> 01:28:00.111
l'm a female, l swear.

01:28:10.526 --> 01:28:14.462
-Wait, are those what l think they are?
-l'm sorry.

01:28:14.964 --> 01:28:16.989
Where do you get off having tits?

01:28:17.767 --> 01:28:21.703
There was this contest,
and l needed to prove it...

01:28:21.871 --> 01:28:25.773
...but then l stayed and l met you,
and you're so wonderful that--

01:28:25.942 --> 01:28:29.844
-Shit, l can't believe this.
-Rick, l know you're mad.

01:28:30.012 --> 01:28:34.005
But l think you're terrific, and your
friendship means so much to me...

01:28:34.183 --> 01:28:37.243
-...that l just--
-Then this whole thing was bullshit.

01:28:37.587 --> 01:28:39.919
Major bullshit.

01:28:40.223 --> 01:28:41.952
Rick, wait.

01:28:42.258 --> 01:28:45.489
You've gotta understand how much
you mean to me, believe me.

01:28:45.661 --> 01:28:49.529
Right, Terrence, because
you've been so honest up till now.

01:29:00.109 --> 01:29:03.601
-So how's the fish?
-Great, l put a frogman in the bowl.

01:29:03.779 --> 01:29:07.010
And you know what?
They really do love pizza.

01:29:10.453 --> 01:29:13.183
-Rick, can't you just forgive me?
-No, l can't.

01:29:13.356 --> 01:29:14.846
Rick.

01:29:24.133 --> 01:29:27.125
lt's okay, everybody. lt's all right.

01:29:28.504 --> 01:29:30.495
-He has tits.
-What?

01:29:30.673 --> 01:29:32.664
Come on, Deborah, let's go.

01:29:46.455 --> 01:29:50.050
Whoa, 9:1 5 already.

01:29:50.226 --> 01:29:53.354
Well, gotta go.

01:29:54.730 --> 01:29:58.826
Had a lovely time,
have a nice prom.

01:30:03.139 --> 01:30:04.401
Hi.

01:30:04.573 --> 01:30:07.542
-You're probably here with a date.
-Yeah.

01:30:15.451 --> 01:30:17.180
Thanks, son.

01:30:52.355 --> 01:30:54.983
Buddy, why'd you bring Kevin?

01:30:56.492 --> 01:30:58.187
Good evening.

01:30:59.395 --> 01:31:00.657
Hey, no problem.

01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:04.732
Just a couple of nice all-American
kids experimenting with sex.

01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:07.368
-You remember Sandy, the fish girl?
-Hi.

01:31:08.137 --> 01:31:09.729
Hello.

01:31:11.273 --> 01:31:14.970
You know, my voyage
of self-discovery...

01:31:16.979 --> 01:31:19.174
...has ended in despair.

01:31:19.615 --> 01:31:24.177
Hey, that's so interesting, really.
Could you shut the light off, please?

01:32:15.671 --> 01:32:18.105
l'm seeing Julian
again this weekend.

01:32:18.274 --> 01:32:20.504
He is so cool.

01:32:20.676 --> 01:32:25.978
-l can't believe l finally lucked out.
-Denise, he is the lucky one.

01:32:26.148 --> 01:32:27.911
Hey, Terry...

01:32:28.084 --> 01:32:30.917
...is it true you broke up
with that college guy?

01:32:31.153 --> 01:32:34.850
-lt's true.
-You wanna go out Saturday night?

01:32:35.024 --> 01:32:37.185
l'm sorry, but l'm really not ready.

01:32:37.359 --> 01:32:40.021
What about Sunday,
you think that's enough time?

01:32:40.196 --> 01:32:41.857
Thanks.

01:32:43.766 --> 01:32:46.428
Terry, you have to snap out of this.

01:32:46.602 --> 01:32:48.194
l will.

01:32:48.370 --> 01:32:51.066
Just may take me a couple of years.

01:32:52.108 --> 01:32:53.632
Terry.

01:32:53.809 --> 01:32:55.800
l really liked your article.

01:32:56.045 --> 01:33:00.175
Especially the part on how you can
be cool even if you don't dress cool.

01:33:00.749 --> 01:33:02.649
l feel the same way.

01:33:03.319 --> 01:33:05.753
You wanna go out sometime?

01:33:08.524 --> 01:33:10.958
l'm really not ready yet.

01:33:11.527 --> 01:33:13.290
Thanks anyway.

01:33:18.968 --> 01:33:20.765
Shelley, wait up.

01:33:23.839 --> 01:33:27.172
Terry, could you come
in here please?

01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:29.901
Mr. Raymaker.

01:33:30.312 --> 01:33:32.439
Come into my office.

01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:44.684
l read your article in the S <i>un-Tribune</i>.

01:33:45.594 --> 01:33:48.461
-Congratulations on winning.
-Thanks.

01:33:48.898 --> 01:33:51.366
lt was real good.

01:33:53.135 --> 01:33:56.866
-And l'm sorry l misjudged you.
-You don't have to apologize.

01:33:57.339 --> 01:34:00.069
l wouldn't have this job
if it weren't for you.

01:34:00.242 --> 01:34:02.369
You forced me to fight for
what l wanted...

01:34:02.545 --> 01:34:05.309
...and l will never forget you for that.

01:34:05.581 --> 01:34:07.344
Thank you.

01:34:07.850 --> 01:34:10.114
l learned a lot too.

01:34:14.723 --> 01:34:18.454
What about that kid you wrote
the article about, Rick?

01:34:18.627 --> 01:34:19.958
He hates me.

01:34:20.129 --> 01:34:22.324
Well, that's too bad.

01:34:22.998 --> 01:34:24.556
You really like him, don't you?

01:34:25.935 --> 01:34:27.562
Why do you say that?

01:34:29.171 --> 01:34:30.661
l read your article.

01:34:45.487 --> 01:34:49.287
Don't worry, l'm a stunt driver,
l do this for a living.

01:34:52.528 --> 01:34:54.723
Swift parking job, Bud.

01:34:54.897 --> 01:34:58.094
-And you're late.
-Yeah, l ran out of gas.

01:34:58.267 --> 01:35:01.430
But don't worry,
l put a buck's worth in, on me.

01:35:03.739 --> 01:35:05.730
Terry, it's summer, smile.

01:35:06.075 --> 01:35:08.771
My face hurts when l smile.

01:35:08.944 --> 01:35:11.538
Listen to me, O sister of my loins.

01:35:11.714 --> 01:35:14.581
l've got a driver's license
and a sex life.

01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:17.275
You've got the job of your dreams
and a chauffer.

01:35:17.453 --> 01:35:20.616
Life is sweet, let's get an ice cream.

01:35:23.659 --> 01:35:25.786
lt's for you.

01:35:29.798 --> 01:35:31.459
You look very good in a dress.

01:35:32.501 --> 01:35:34.401
Very good.

01:35:39.341 --> 01:35:40.968
l thought you hated me.

01:35:42.278 --> 01:35:44.439
l missed you.

01:35:45.848 --> 01:35:48.442
l read your article. Do you...

01:35:49.451 --> 01:35:52.045
...still feel the same way about me?

01:35:55.557 --> 01:35:56.956
Yeah, l guess l do.

01:36:01.096 --> 01:36:02.961
Why don't we go out
and have some fun?

01:36:03.132 --> 01:36:05.623
You know, maybe we could go
dancing Friday night?

01:36:05.801 --> 01:36:07.598
Wait a minute.

01:36:08.437 --> 01:36:12.305
l'm the guy here.
Let me just try this, okay?

01:36:12.708 --> 01:36:16.439
Why don't we go out dancing
Friday night?

01:36:16.612 --> 01:36:19.103
What an original idea.

01:36:20.349 --> 01:36:23.113
-Hey, you wanna go for a ride?
