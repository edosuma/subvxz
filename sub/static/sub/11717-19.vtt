00:22.756 --> 00:26.886
Mom? Mom? Mom?

00:27.360 --> 00:28.793
I can do a cannonball.
You wanna see?

00:28.962 --> 00:30.930
- Of course I do.
- Okay, watch.

00:36.002 --> 00:38.232
Good job, sweetie.

00:44.978 --> 00:46.070
Honey, don't splash.

00:51.084 --> 00:52.551
Dill?

00:54.087 --> 00:55.679
Dillan?

00:56.389 --> 00:59.051
Dillan? Dillan?

01:00.160 --> 01:02.424
What's wrong?
- My son. I can't find him.

01:02.595 --> 01:04.893
He went underwater.

01:05.632 --> 01:09.625
Mom. Mom. I found a quarter
at the bottom of the pool.

01:09.803 --> 01:12.397
Don't ever disappear like that again.
Do you understand me?

01:13.173 --> 01:14.970
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- No problem.

01:15.141 --> 01:16.403
Didn't you hear me calling you?

01:17.410 --> 01:18.775
You scared me half to death.

01:19.379 --> 01:20.403
Come on. Let's go.

01:21.581 --> 01:22.912
Dillan, try to be more care...

02:06.059 --> 02:08.493
Do you stop
for malasadas this morning?

02:09.062 --> 02:10.529
No.

02:12.031 --> 02:14.591
What is it,
evidence from a case or something?

02:14.767 --> 02:16.462
No.

02:17.403 --> 02:20.065
You know, just stop. Stop.
What's in the bag? What's in the bag?

02:21.174 --> 02:24.075
- It's my lunch, genius.
- Your lunch? Okay, what'd you bring?

02:25.745 --> 02:27.838
You've gotta know every last
minute detail of my life?

02:28.014 --> 02:29.538
What's it to you what my lunch is?

02:29.716 --> 02:32.514
Because you don't want to tell me.
What, you think I'm gonna steal it?

02:32.685 --> 02:34.949
You fly in some deep-fried sandwich
from New Jersey

02:35.121 --> 02:36.383
I'm not allowed to know about?

02:36.556 --> 02:42.085
It's a salad. Okay? Salad. That's it.
Nothing else in here. Just a salad.

02:42.262 --> 02:43.854
Grace has been taking
a nutrition class

02:44.030 --> 02:45.691
and she's concerned
about my cholesterol

02:45.865 --> 02:50.359
so I promised her that I would
eat better. Okay? Happy?

02:51.704 --> 02:53.035
That's actually incredibly sweet.

02:53.206 --> 02:54.833
I appreciate that.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.272
The whole modern eating thing
is just ridiculous to me.

02:57.443 --> 02:59.206
When I was a kid
we ate whatever we wanted.

02:59.379 --> 03:01.540
- You know what I mean?
- No more, buddy.

03:01.714 --> 03:03.375
Hold up.

03:03.550 --> 03:04.574
Who's that?

03:07.654 --> 03:10.054
I don't know.

03:16.729 --> 03:19.027
- Can I help you?
- Jenna Kaye,

03:19.232 --> 03:20.927
Central Intelligence Agency.

03:26.139 --> 03:28.573
Special Agent Kaye,
what can I do for you?

03:29.542 --> 03:31.635
I believe I have something
that belongs to you.

03:31.811 --> 03:33.403
<i>I can't continue this investigation</i>

03:33.580 --> 03:35.639
<i>into the police department
from the inside.</i>

03:35.815 --> 03:38.648
<i>I don't trust the
people I work with.</i>

03:39.552 --> 03:41.679
That's my father's voice recorder.
How'd you get that?

03:41.854 --> 03:42.912
How'd you lose it?

03:46.859 --> 03:50.192
- It was stolen by a local yakuza boss.
- Hiro Noshimuri.

03:50.363 --> 03:52.456
You can stop asking questions
you know the answers to.

03:52.632 --> 03:55.032
I have one more. Would you
kindly gather all of the case files

03:55.201 --> 03:58.102
related to your investigation
and your father's private files?

03:58.671 --> 04:00.605
- Why?
- The agency has taken an interest

04:00.773 --> 04:03.264
in your investigation
of Noshimuri and the yakuza.

04:03.443 --> 04:05.343
- That's all I can say.
- That's all you can say.

04:05.511 --> 04:06.944
Well, I'm gonna say something,
then.

04:07.113 --> 04:08.512
The yakuza was targeting my father

04:08.681 --> 04:10.376
and is responsible
for my mother's murder.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.245
I'm sorry, but this matter has been
classified above your pay grade.

04:13.419 --> 04:16.478
Why don't you unclassify it,
and I won't even ask for a raise?

04:16.923 --> 04:19.084
Would you like me to have the director
call the governor

04:19.259 --> 04:21.022
to compel you
to hand over your files?

04:24.631 --> 04:26.223
Are you threatening me?

04:26.399 --> 04:28.526
I wanna know if you're gonna
make this hard on yourself

04:28.701 --> 04:30.498
or are we gonna get along?

04:33.973 --> 04:36.669
Hey, uh, we got something.
Sorry to interrupt.

04:36.843 --> 04:38.367
- I'll be right there.
- Okay.

04:46.219 --> 04:48.813
You'll have my files
by the end of the day. Okay?

04:48.988 --> 04:52.856
- Now give me my father's recorder.
- You'll get it when I get the files.

04:58.631 --> 05:01.031
Why did you not just give her
your files right then and there?

05:01.234 --> 05:02.360
What is your play? Please?

05:02.535 --> 05:04.264
Must you know every detail
in my life?

05:04.437 --> 05:06.667
Hey, this is the CIA
you are dealing with here. Okay?

05:06.839 --> 05:09.467
They wrote the book
on advanced interrogation techniques,

05:09.642 --> 05:10.939
which I am absolutely positive,

05:11.144 --> 05:14.238
you have sitting on your bedside table
right now. Okay?

05:14.781 --> 05:16.271
Just so you know, I understand.
Okay?

05:16.449 --> 05:18.542
I wouldn't mind a little
one-on-one session with Kaye.

05:18.718 --> 05:20.709
The thought does stimulate
my imagination too.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.021
Legally, the CIA can only interrogate
foreign nationals.

05:26.192 --> 05:28.888
Why you do that?
I had a little fantasy worked out.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.428
I mean,
you're like a devourer of dreams.

05:31.597 --> 05:33.189
You know what I mean?
Like, you eat them.

05:33.366 --> 05:35.425
You're like a little Pac-Man
in cargo pants.

05:43.309 --> 05:45.072
Let me guess.
This guy thought he could fly.

05:45.244 --> 05:46.711
A common misconception.

05:46.879 --> 05:50.474
Although Captain Fallout dons a cape,
he's not capable of actual flight.

05:50.683 --> 05:52.583
Merely superhuman leaping abilities.

05:52.752 --> 05:55.585
Max, who's Captain Fallout?

05:55.755 --> 05:57.382
The fearless leader
of the Wondrous Seven.

06:00.159 --> 06:01.820
He acquired his powers
when he was attacked

06:01.994 --> 06:03.825
by one of Hitler's radioactive
German shepherds

06:03.996 --> 06:05.725
during the Battle of the Bulge.

06:06.766 --> 06:08.165
Really?

06:08.334 --> 06:10.131
Wow. You guys need to brush up
on your classics.

06:10.303 --> 06:11.827
We don't need to brush up
on anything.

06:12.004 --> 06:13.835
You need to bring
us all back to reality,

06:14.006 --> 06:16.133
here on Earth,
and answer the obvious question:

06:16.309 --> 06:18.277
Why this guy
took a dive wearing tights.

06:18.444 --> 06:20.412
Well Spectacucon is in town
this weekend.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.605
So I assume our victim
was going to attend.

06:22.782 --> 06:26.775
Okay, it's a comic-book convention.
Do we have an ID on the vic yet?

06:26.953 --> 06:29.922
Afraid not.
But due to the nature of the injuries

06:30.089 --> 06:32.319
I would estimate that he fell
at least ten stories.

06:32.492 --> 06:34.619
Maybe he's a jumper, Max.
No.

06:34.794 --> 06:37.024
This was definitely a homicide.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.164
Facial lacerations imbedded
with glass fragments

06:39.332 --> 06:41.926
indicates our victim was mostly likely
thrown out of a window,

06:42.101 --> 06:43.966
perhaps a sliding glass door.

06:44.137 --> 06:47.231
The residues on both wrists
are consistent with duct tape.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.772
- He was bound?
- Yes.

06:48.941 --> 06:50.670
And the defensive bruising
also suggests...

06:50.843 --> 06:53.607
That he struggled with his attacker.
Okay.

06:58.184 --> 07:00.550
A message from Psycho Kitty.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.915
"Be careful, he's looking for you."

07:04.190 --> 07:06.658
Too bad our vic
didn't get this warning in time.

07:28.848 --> 07:30.748
Okay. Keep us posted.

07:30.917 --> 07:33.317
That was Kono.
She's got an ID off the vic's cell.

07:33.486 --> 07:35.977
So, what is, uh, Captain Fallout's
secret identity?

07:36.155 --> 07:39.056
His name is Alex Baker. He's
an insurance adjustor from Atlanta.

07:39.225 --> 07:41.056
He flew in two days ago
for this convention.

07:41.227 --> 07:43.457
Chin and Kono are checking out
his hotel right now.

07:46.999 --> 07:48.489
What's up, dog?

07:48.668 --> 07:51.034
- Funny, right?
- That is funny.

07:51.838 --> 07:54.807
Psycho Kitty's
gotta be here somewhere.

07:58.411 --> 08:01.574
- This may take a while.
- More good news.

08:03.850 --> 08:06.375
Holy air conditioning.
It's a meat freezer in here.

08:06.552 --> 08:08.747
Tourists, they come to Hawaii
for the sun.

08:08.921 --> 08:11.116
They spend all their time
in freezing hotel rooms.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.554
No signs of forced entry.

08:14.460 --> 08:15.586
Or a struggle.

08:30.209 --> 08:32.541
Trajectory lines up.
It's a clear drop to the pool below.

08:33.946 --> 08:35.277
You know,
Max said that Alex Baker

08:35.448 --> 08:37.075
had facial lacerations
from broken glass.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.548
They're obviously not
from these windows.

08:39.719 --> 08:41.653
I don't think this is our crime scene.

08:41.854 --> 08:45.085
Well, our vic had to be thrown off
the building from someplace.

08:49.228 --> 08:52.129
It's broken glass. It's gotta be
from the suite directly above.

08:57.403 --> 09:01.305
Room 1703 is registered to Jonathan
Demille from Port Allen, Louisiana.

09:01.474 --> 09:03.601
Manager says it has
the exact same layout as Room 1603,

09:03.776 --> 09:06.336
Alex Baker's room,
just directly one floor above.

09:06.512 --> 09:09.037
Look, there's a card still in the lock.

09:09.215 --> 09:10.910
That's weird.

09:15.955 --> 09:17.923
Way weird.

09:19.191 --> 09:21.659
Try the one the hotel manager
gave you.

09:36.008 --> 09:38.602
This is our crime scene.

09:45.551 --> 09:47.280
She goes
by the name Psycho Kitty.

09:47.453 --> 09:50.115
- You sure you haven't seen her?
- Uh-uh.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.688
You're supposed
to be looking for Psycho Kitty.

09:53.859 --> 09:56.225
Did you see her? I may have been
too judgmental about this,

09:56.395 --> 09:57.885
- because she's cute...
- Can you focus?

09:58.064 --> 09:59.531
Sure. Look at this.

09:59.699 --> 10:02.395
Captain Kirk, we would just like
to ask you a couple of questions.

10:02.568 --> 10:04.798
- Commander Sisko.
- Commander Sisko?

10:04.971 --> 10:06.131
<i>Of DS9?</i>

10:06.305 --> 10:08.535
<i>Ah, you ever seen any brothers
on the Enterprise?</i>

10:09.175 --> 10:10.472
- Well there's the one.
- Uhura.

10:10.643 --> 10:12.406
- Uhura.
- She was a sister

10:12.578 --> 10:13.704
and she answered the phone.

10:13.879 --> 10:16.074
- I'm a commander.
- Okay, we have that in common.

10:16.248 --> 10:18.512
Listen, my partner and I
are looking for this person.

10:18.684 --> 10:20.675
- Have you seen her?
- Sure, that's Psycho Kitty.

10:20.853 --> 10:22.445
I'd like to beam her up to my quarters.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.613
Hangs with the plushies
at the Furry Fandom exhibit.

10:24.824 --> 10:26.086
Plushies at the?

10:26.258 --> 10:28.385
Do you know what Psycho Kitty's
real name is?

10:31.998 --> 10:34.694
- Gail Woodson?
- Yes?

10:35.901 --> 10:39.894
Alex and I met
on an online message board.

10:43.209 --> 10:46.007
And we started talking
on the phone and, um...

10:46.178 --> 10:47.907
You know, we like the same stuff:

10:48.114 --> 10:51.481
Monty Python, Neil Gaiman,
keyboard cat videos.

10:53.119 --> 10:54.984
Got real serious, real fast.

10:55.921 --> 10:57.980
But you guys never
actually met face to face?

10:58.591 --> 11:01.253
Not until today.
And I was pretty nervous.

11:01.894 --> 11:05.295
But then, once I saw him,

11:05.498 --> 11:08.160
I don't know, I can't explain it.
It was like...

11:08.934 --> 11:11.198
Like I've known him my whole life.

11:11.737 --> 11:14.535
- But then...
- Then what?

11:15.374 --> 11:16.807
Then my ex-husband Trevor
showed up.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.068
He must have hacked
my e-mail or something

11:19.245 --> 11:22.908
because he knew we were
gonna meet up here. He flipped out.

11:23.082 --> 11:26.176
- And he caused a big scene.
- Did he get violent?

11:26.352 --> 11:29.082
Trevor said
that I couldn't see Alex anymore.

11:29.255 --> 11:31.917
And that if I did he would find Alex.

11:32.091 --> 11:35.288
And when he found him,
he would kill him.

11:38.464 --> 11:41.399
Trevor Wright,
a.k.a. Psycho Kitty's ex.

11:41.567 --> 11:43.501
Jacksonville sheriff
just sent down his jacket.

11:43.669 --> 11:46.399
This guy has a stupid,
stupid amount of assault charges.

11:46.572 --> 11:47.630
A temper, huh?

11:47.807 --> 11:50.776
He's violated probation by being here
at all, which is two years mandatory.

11:52.144 --> 11:53.270
Detective Danny Williams.

11:54.613 --> 11:56.979
All right, good. Thank you.

11:57.149 --> 11:58.844
Put an APB on Trevor's rental car.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.712
They just found it parked
at Kailua Beach.

12:12.598 --> 12:14.532
Trevor Wright, Five-0.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.728
Hey, Five-0. Hey!

12:34.453 --> 12:36.819
Hey, you need a lift?

12:37.523 --> 12:39.354
I guess that's a "no."

12:54.740 --> 12:56.799
You're under arrest
for the murder of Alex Baker.

12:57.376 --> 12:58.604
Who the hell is Alex Baker?

12:58.778 --> 13:00.746
Alex Baker is the guy
that you threatened

13:00.913 --> 13:03.177
in front of your ex-wife
and a couple hundred other witnesses.

13:03.349 --> 13:05.078
Didn't get his name
before you threw him?

13:05.251 --> 13:07.378
What, super dork? He's dead?

13:07.820 --> 13:10.015
Let me put this together for you,
all right.

13:10.189 --> 13:12.851
This morning you threatened
to kill Alex. Two hours later he's dead.

13:13.025 --> 13:15.550
You see the connection there?
There's a connection. You got that?

13:15.728 --> 13:18.219
No way.
Look, I just wanted to scare him.

13:18.397 --> 13:20.865
But after he ran away,
Gail unloaded on me.

13:21.033 --> 13:24.366
Made it clear we were never gonna
be together again. So I was upset.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.027
I left the convention, came out here.

13:26.205 --> 13:28.139
Took one of those
dolphin watching cruises.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.673
Hmm.
- Shirt pocket, check it.

13:35.714 --> 13:37.579
"Dolphin excursions, 11 a.m."

13:37.750 --> 13:41.151
There's at least a dozen people
who can put me on that boat today.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.645
Dolphins?

13:46.225 --> 13:48.056
Yeah, okay. Got it.

13:48.794 --> 13:52.195
That was McGarrett. Their suspect
checks out. Alibi's rock solid.

13:52.398 --> 13:54.093
- What'd you get?
- Jonathan Demille,

13:54.266 --> 13:56.564
the name this room is booked under,
dead for nearly a year.

13:56.735 --> 13:59.636
But a credit card was opened up with
his name and social a few months ago.

13:59.805 --> 14:02.968
It's called ghosting. You take the
identity of someone recently deceased

14:03.142 --> 14:06.077
and then you rack up charges
until the credit-card company wises up.

14:06.245 --> 14:08.372
And here I am paying
18.5 percent interest?

14:09.815 --> 14:11.680
Well here's a $30,000 watch.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.580
Maybe you can use this
to pay off your debts.

14:13.752 --> 14:16.482
Ripe for the taking,
which means this wasn't a robbery.

14:16.655 --> 14:19.055
Someone tossed this room
looking for something specific.

14:19.225 --> 14:21.921
Right. It still doesn't explain
how our vic ended up in this room.

14:22.094 --> 14:25.120
I had the manager run the key card
we found in the lock this morning.

14:25.297 --> 14:27.162
It was programmed for Room 1603.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.130
Okay, so then why would
our friend Alex Baker

14:29.301 --> 14:30.962
use his room key
to try and get in here?

14:31.136 --> 14:32.262
Okay, well, get this.

14:32.438 --> 14:35.100
The hotel records show he signed
for drinks at the bar this morning.

14:35.274 --> 14:37.936
I had Max run his blood alcohol.
It was three times the legal limit.

14:38.110 --> 14:39.134
The guy was blasted.

14:39.311 --> 14:41.871
So he leaves the convention
and hits the bar to drown his sorrows.

14:42.047 --> 14:44.140
He rides the elevator
and gets off on the wrong floor.

14:44.583 --> 14:47.313
Right. And in these hotels
all the corridors look exactly the same.

14:47.486 --> 14:49.181
And he's too wasted to notice
his mistake.

14:49.355 --> 14:50.982
Meanwhile
someone's ransacking this room,

14:51.156 --> 14:53.420
then hear Baker at the door
trying to get in with his key.

14:53.592 --> 14:55.025
They pull him inside
and tie him up

14:55.194 --> 14:56.923
because, as far as they know,
he's their man.

14:57.096 --> 14:59.223
Kono, we need to find
whoever booked this room.

15:00.032 --> 15:02.262
They're our only lead
to catching our killer.

15:12.511 --> 15:13.705
Where did you find this?

15:13.879 --> 15:16.643
It was recovered in the course
of an active homicide investigation.

15:16.815 --> 15:18.476
Homicide?

15:18.651 --> 15:21.119
I don't understand.
What does this have to do with us?

15:21.287 --> 15:24.415
A man was murdered this morning
and that watch was at the crime scene.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.150
When I ran the serial number, it came
back registered to your husband.

15:27.326 --> 15:29.021
Mrs. Davis,
may I speak with him, please?

15:29.194 --> 15:31.685
Richard's out of town on business.
He's expected back tonight.

15:32.331 --> 15:35.698
Wait, you don't think he had
something to do with this, do you?

15:35.868 --> 15:38.666
- His watch was at the scene.
- Richard couldn't have been involved.

15:38.837 --> 15:40.964
This watch was stolen
from our house three days ago.

15:41.140 --> 15:42.835
- Did you file a police report?
- Of course.

15:43.008 --> 15:45.568
Well, they gave me a copy.
I'll go get it.

16:02.161 --> 16:03.685
Look, it's right here.

16:06.065 --> 16:08.431
Looking at what was taken,
it could have been a lot worse.

16:08.600 --> 16:09.692
That's quite a collection.

16:09.868 --> 16:12.234
Do you think the person
that robbed us killed somebody?

16:12.404 --> 16:13.666
At this point, we don't know.

16:13.839 --> 16:16.501
But just consider yourselves lucky
you weren't home when they hit.

16:25.351 --> 16:26.875
Stephen McGarrett?

16:28.988 --> 16:30.216
As requested.

16:31.023 --> 16:33.014
Enjoy the rest of your day.

16:58.117 --> 17:01.644
- You, what's your name?
- Wo Fat.

17:12.798 --> 17:14.356
Yeah?

17:16.001 --> 17:17.662
Housekeeping.

17:17.836 --> 17:19.666
No, no, thank you. I'm good.

17:19.872 --> 17:23.808
There should...
There should be a sign on the door.

17:23.976 --> 17:26.069
We need to talk.

17:30.816 --> 17:32.306
How'd you find me here?

17:34.420 --> 17:36.752
It's above your pay grade.

17:38.590 --> 17:41.457
- We need to talk.
- There's nothing I can share with you.

17:41.660 --> 17:44.060
I'm gonna do something
that your agency has a problem with,

17:44.229 --> 17:45.457
and that's be honest with you.

17:45.631 --> 17:47.895
You got two options,
the way I see it right now.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.659
The first one
is that I walk out of here.

17:49.835 --> 17:51.928
The second one is that you tell me
what's going on.

17:52.104 --> 17:55.005
Because that's the only way you get
to know what I know. You understand?

17:56.708 --> 17:58.437
Okay. Fine.

17:58.610 --> 18:02.307
- I really wish you would have knocked.
- I did, twice.

18:02.815 --> 18:06.546
What, are you moving in here?
Nobody unpacks in a hotel.

18:06.718 --> 18:08.151
Habits of a clean freak.

18:09.188 --> 18:11.486
Really? How long have you been
tracking the yakuza?

18:11.657 --> 18:12.681
Longer than you.

18:12.858 --> 18:15.759
You read the State Department report
outlining how they launder money?

18:15.928 --> 18:18.419
I'm listed in the footnotes
as a source.

18:18.597 --> 18:21.157
So you're a subject matter expert.
That's why they brought you in?

18:21.333 --> 18:23.028
I know as much as the next gal.

18:27.473 --> 18:30.533
You know what?
We got off on the wrong foot.

18:30.709 --> 18:34.941
And I think it's my fault. I shouldn't be
kicking your door in. I'm sorry.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.309
I'm gonna cooperate with the agency
in any way I can.

18:37.483 --> 18:39.883
In fact, I'm gonna call
Director Hadley right now

18:40.052 --> 18:43.283
and I'm gonna officially
offer my services to your task force

18:43.455 --> 18:45.980
because that's the kind of freedom
the Five-0 has.

18:47.860 --> 18:51.057
- Stop. Stop it. Stop!
- Hang on a second.

18:54.399 --> 18:56.993
You obviously already know
I'm not on official assignment.

18:57.169 --> 18:59.535
You're not even a field agent.
You're a low level analyst.

18:59.705 --> 19:02.697
And that suit you wore this morning
playing grown-ups with me in my office

19:02.875 --> 19:05.605
probably cost you two weeks' salary,
I bet.

19:05.777 --> 19:07.836
I bet you've never even
left your desk before.

19:08.013 --> 19:09.037
You need to leave.

19:09.214 --> 19:12.877
I think you've gone rogue
to hunt down a man named Wo Fat.

19:14.019 --> 19:16.214
Couple months ago,
I met him on the 18th hole.

19:16.388 --> 19:19.050
He was playing a round of golf
with the man that killed my mother.

19:19.791 --> 19:22.726
And if he's working with him,
you need to tell me right now.

19:28.100 --> 19:32.264
There's something
I need to show you. Not here.

19:34.640 --> 19:37.074
I ID'd our missing thief,
Jonathan Demille.

19:37.242 --> 19:39.608
And I pulled a statement
from his credit card.

19:39.778 --> 19:42.770
All right, well, for the very least,
he's stimulating the local economy.

19:42.948 --> 19:44.745
He got a $1,000 in the skate shop,

19:44.917 --> 19:47.681
another few hundred
at a video-game store.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.651
The last couple of weeks, he spent
almost 20 grand at a strip club.

19:50.822 --> 19:52.414
Place called "Femme Nu."

19:52.591 --> 19:55.617
You cannot spend that kind of money
without attracting some attention.

19:55.794 --> 19:57.853
Someone's gotta be able
to point us towards this guy.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.521
And maybe he can point us
towards our killer.

20:04.436 --> 20:06.199
How you doing?
What can I get you?

20:06.371 --> 20:08.305
We're actually looking
for a customer of yours.

20:08.473 --> 20:11.909
- His name is Jonathan Demille.
- Oh, you mean Johnny D.

20:12.077 --> 20:13.135
Yeah, sure, I know him.

20:13.312 --> 20:15.507
You guys aren't the only ones
looking for him.

20:15.681 --> 20:18.616
- Why? What do you mean?
- There's this big guy in a track suit,

20:18.784 --> 20:21.776
buzzed hair, goatee.
You can just tell he's bad news.

20:21.954 --> 20:24.445
Well, that guy just dropped
an innocent man off a balcony

20:24.623 --> 20:25.920
thinking he was Johnny D.

20:26.091 --> 20:28.355
I didn't tell him
where he could find Johnny D.

20:28.527 --> 20:29.687
Couldn't have if I wanted to.

20:29.861 --> 20:33.092
Now you don't find Johnny D.
Johnny D finds you.

20:34.199 --> 20:35.257
That's very spooky.

20:35.434 --> 20:37.994
Uh, when is the last time
that Johnny D found you?

20:38.170 --> 20:40.297
Tuesday, when his girl Tiffany
was working.

20:40.472 --> 20:44.169
- Tiffany? Is she here now?
No, she's off today.

20:45.978 --> 20:48.503
All right, so the girl's name
is Tiffany Martin.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.477
I just pulled her phone records.

20:51.216 --> 20:53.116
All right, these are text messages.

20:53.285 --> 20:58.621
I'm gonna run a key word search
for Johnny's name. And here you go.

20:58.790 --> 21:01.350
It looks like they've been
going back and forth for a few weeks.

21:01.526 --> 21:05.360
See if you can't find his real name
or an address off the account.

21:05.530 --> 21:06.690
Yeah.

21:08.200 --> 21:11.397
Damn. No, it's a prepaid cell.
It's untraceable.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.902
You don't find Johnny, he finds you.

21:15.374 --> 21:17.638
You're gonna quote
this schmuck now?

21:18.310 --> 21:21.541
I can spoof Tiffany's cell and make it
look like she's sending him a text.

21:22.014 --> 21:23.038
Lure him here. I like it.

21:23.215 --> 21:25.149
But move over, please,
because I'm gonna do this

21:25.317 --> 21:27.649
because it should be very filthy
and you're a young lady.

21:27.819 --> 21:30.879
It's set up. Whatever you send is
gonna look like it's from Tiffany's cell.

21:31.056 --> 21:32.921
Got it.

21:33.125 --> 21:37.391
- "Hey, stud."
- Ha. That's not your lead in, is it?

21:37.562 --> 21:39.154
What?
I'm trying to sound like a stripper.

21:39.331 --> 21:42.494
- Try harder.
- Okay.

21:42.668 --> 21:46.729
- "If you are available..." What?
- You're so bad. Get out of here.

21:46.905 --> 21:48.566
- Go ahead.
- I'm embarrassed for you now.

21:48.740 --> 21:50.139
Really, I am.

21:56.948 --> 21:58.711
It's sent.

22:01.186 --> 22:06.123
That's, uh... That's effective, I guess.
It worked.

22:06.291 --> 22:08.816
- Wow. All right.
- Girl's got game.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.554
- Damn!
- Ha.

22:17.269 --> 22:19.635
Wo Fat was one of the good guys.

22:19.805 --> 22:23.036
He started his career as an intelligence
agent for the Chinese MSS.

22:23.208 --> 22:24.539
Quickly became one of their best.

22:24.710 --> 22:26.644
I got the highlights
in your investigation file.

22:26.812 --> 22:28.803
He worked counter-intelligence
at the 6th Bureau.

22:28.980 --> 22:31.778
He reached the rank of colonel,
then he suddenly disappeared, right?

22:31.950 --> 22:34.316
Disappeared for years.
Whatever he was doing,

22:34.486 --> 22:36.750
he must've realized that
government work doesn't pay well.

22:36.922 --> 22:38.082
Because when he resurfaced,

22:38.256 --> 22:41.748
he was already a major player
in the criminal underworld.

22:43.261 --> 22:46.424
- Sorry, what did you just do?
- I'm sorry, what?

22:46.598 --> 22:48.156
- That. What is that?
- What happened?

22:48.333 --> 22:50.062
Oh, you mean my gum?

22:50.235 --> 22:51.998
Yeah, with your gum.
This is a computer.

22:52.204 --> 22:55.605
It's not your high school desk.
Thank you.

22:57.275 --> 22:59.140
How many bodies have you put
on Wo Fat?

22:59.311 --> 23:01.006
Twenty-three that we know of.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.340
CIA's been tracking his movements
for nearly a decade.

23:03.515 --> 23:05.506
But every time we think we're close,
he vanishes.

23:05.717 --> 23:07.207
It's like he's playing with us.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.581
But a few months ago,
I tracked him to Hawaii.

23:09.755 --> 23:11.655
He paid a visit
to someone you know.

23:13.358 --> 23:16.293
Victor Hesse.
That's the man who killed my father.

23:18.263 --> 23:21.096
Wait a minute. I didn't know
Victor Hesse worked with Wo Fat.

23:21.266 --> 23:24.929
He doesn't work with Wo Fat.
He works for Wo Fat.

23:25.437 --> 23:28.304
Same with the yakuza. None of them
makes a move without his approval.

23:33.645 --> 23:36.876
Are you trying to tell me that Wo Fat
ordered my father's murder?

23:38.049 --> 23:39.482
I believe so.

23:41.186 --> 23:43.313
No, no, that doesn't make sense.

23:43.488 --> 23:46.355
Victor Hesse killed my father
because I wouldn't release his brother.

23:46.525 --> 23:49.119
Victor Hesse arrived in Hawaii
before you captured his brother.

23:49.294 --> 23:50.852
How could he have anticipated that?

23:51.029 --> 23:54.465
I believe that Wo Fat
sent him here to do a job.

23:55.700 --> 23:59.136
- To murder my father?
- I'm sorry.

24:02.307 --> 24:04.070
You know what else
doesn't make sense to me?

24:04.276 --> 24:07.473
Why would you break away from
the agency to hunt Wo Fat alone?

24:07.646 --> 24:09.375
Why not work through the channels?

24:09.548 --> 24:11.880
You got the CIA behind you.
What's going on?

24:13.318 --> 24:17.084
Three years ago, I was working
the Central Asia desk at Langley

24:17.289 --> 24:19.519
when I uncovered a series
of illegal arms deals

24:19.691 --> 24:22.159
being brokered out of China.

24:22.327 --> 24:24.795
My team ended up tracing them
back to Wo Fat.

24:24.963 --> 24:27.454
Somebody who wasn't
even on the agency's radar yet.

24:27.632 --> 24:30.601
I was the first one
to put a name to the face.

24:32.404 --> 24:34.565
But I got too wrapped up in the hunt.

24:35.073 --> 24:37.564
I tracked him
to an arms deal in Macau.

24:37.742 --> 24:41.473
An agency grab team
was dispatched based on my intel.

24:43.348 --> 24:45.316
But it was a set up.

24:48.687 --> 24:50.882
They walked right into a trap.

24:51.957 --> 24:53.891
There were no survivors.

24:57.529 --> 25:00.191
My fiancé was on that team.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.631
Oh.

25:06.605 --> 25:10.701
And, uh, as standard protocol,
the agency removed you from the case.

25:10.876 --> 25:12.901
Conflict of interest.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.369
But you can't let it go.

25:16.882 --> 25:20.113
After three years of dead ends,
I finally picked up a solid lead,

25:20.285 --> 25:22.947
discovered that Wo Fat
was here in Hawaii.

25:23.121 --> 25:27.490
So I took leave from the CIA
to track him down.

25:28.593 --> 25:30.561
Let me ask you a question.

25:32.797 --> 25:34.992
What are you gonna do
when you find him?

25:36.735 --> 25:38.896
Same thing you would do.

25:41.072 --> 25:42.096
Wait here.

25:53.952 --> 25:56.921
This was stolen from
my father's tool box by Hiro's men.

25:57.155 --> 26:00.318
It's part of the evidence in the case he
was working on before he was killed.

26:00.492 --> 26:03.620
A week ago,
this package was left on my doorstep.

26:03.795 --> 26:05.820
These postcards were inside.

26:05.997 --> 26:07.931
Somebody's obviously
trying to send you a message.

26:09.301 --> 26:11.769
Maybe there's something
on the postcards that you overlooked.

26:11.937 --> 26:13.598
<i>- Yeah?
Steve, it's Danny.</i>

26:13.772 --> 26:16.104
<i>We got a lead on Johnny D.
Meet us at Femme Nu.</i>

26:16.274 --> 26:17.798
All right, I'm on my way.

26:17.976 --> 26:19.671
You've become acquainted
with my office.

26:19.844 --> 26:22.142
Feel free to use it
for as long as you need it.

26:22.314 --> 26:24.782
You're an analyst. Analyze these.

26:25.417 --> 26:26.475
You sure about this?

26:27.519 --> 26:29.009
I plan to find Wo Fat.

26:29.187 --> 26:31.280
And if he's as elusive
as you're saying that he is,

26:31.456 --> 26:32.946
I'm gonna need
all the help I can get.

26:33.124 --> 26:35.217
You and I, we'll meet tomorrow
Onofun Noodle House.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.258
It's on Lewers. 8 p.m.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.795
- I'll be there.
- Be there.

26:40.999 --> 26:43.365
- Oh, and Kaye.
- Yeah?

26:43.668 --> 26:45.932
We're gonna get along just fine.

27:11.763 --> 27:14.891
All right, hold up. This might be him.

27:21.740 --> 27:22.866
Here's Johnny.

27:30.615 --> 27:31.980
Oh, jeez.

27:34.219 --> 27:35.652
Did he really just do that?

27:45.530 --> 27:47.225
- Oh, put him out of his misery.
- Right.

27:52.437 --> 27:54.302
Is there a problem officer?

28:00.645 --> 28:02.840
Johnny D,
you've been racking up bar tabs,

28:03.014 --> 28:06.575
and keeping the strippers in Honolulu
in self-tanner and tattoos.

28:06.751 --> 28:09.413
Well, what can I say?
I like to give back to the community.

28:09.587 --> 28:11.111
You like to take
from the community too.

28:11.289 --> 28:13.416
Come on.
The people I steal from are insured.

28:14.159 --> 28:15.820
This guy is such a jerk.

28:16.027 --> 28:17.995
Aside from obvious
intellectual impairments

28:18.163 --> 28:20.154
you have managed to rip
a lot of people off.

28:20.331 --> 28:23.061
But there is something very
tragic here. You know what it is?

28:23.234 --> 28:26.203
That I won't be seeing Tiffany
for a very long time?

28:26.371 --> 28:31.138
No, incorrect. It's that an innocent man
is dead because of you.

28:31.309 --> 28:32.435
What are you talking about?

28:36.848 --> 28:39.976
That's Alex Baker.
He was booked in at the Lonopuha.

28:40.151 --> 28:42.483
Somebody thought he was you.
Threw him off a balcony.

28:45.423 --> 28:48.324
Man, that's horrible.
Does he have a family?

28:48.493 --> 28:50.552
He had a woman who loved him.

28:52.464 --> 28:56.127
Look, I got word some guy
was asking around about me.

28:56.301 --> 28:57.962
I spotted the dude the next day.

28:58.136 --> 28:59.296
Big guy in a track suit?

28:59.471 --> 29:02.133
Buzzed hair, with lines shaved
into his eyebrows.

29:02.307 --> 29:06.505
Outweighs me by a hundred pounds.
I took off before he could jump me.

29:06.678 --> 29:08.270
That's why I was laying low
at the hotel.

29:08.446 --> 29:10.038
Who is this guy?
Somebody you ripped off?

29:10.548 --> 29:12.846
I doubt it.
The people I had, had money.

29:13.017 --> 29:14.848
Money buys class.
This guy was a thug.

29:15.019 --> 29:16.543
Money also buys hired muscle.

29:16.721 --> 29:20.350
The question is, what did you steal
that's worth killing for?

29:23.628 --> 29:24.993
<i>Voilà.</i>

29:25.163 --> 29:27.324
Wow. Why don't you make this
easy on us

29:27.499 --> 29:30.900
and just direct us towards the stuff
that is from your last boost?

29:31.536 --> 29:35.404
Mavis, can you bring me
the reports from last week's robberies?

29:35.607 --> 29:37.336
Sorry my secretary
must have stepped out.

29:37.509 --> 29:40.376
Smart ass. Do you pack
the garage from back to front?

29:40.545 --> 29:43.343
- Yes, like a dishwasher.
- Good. We start here.

29:43.515 --> 29:45.813
See if we can find
what the killer was looking for,

29:45.984 --> 29:49.147
- maybe we find him. All right?
- Get out of the way, please.

29:56.828 --> 29:58.386
Officer,
if he moves, you can shoot him.

30:03.067 --> 30:06.195
Anything?
- Yeah, I got some antique silverware.

30:06.371 --> 30:08.362
Got about a hundred K
in jewelery here.

30:08.940 --> 30:11.738
I got nothing an insurance claim
wouldn't cover.

30:11.910 --> 30:14.902
- What about you?
- Got it. We're all good.

30:15.079 --> 30:18.014
<i>- Season four, Cheers.
- Funny show.</i>

30:20.151 --> 30:21.618
Always.

30:35.366 --> 30:37.766
Hey, D, check this out.

30:39.270 --> 30:43.969
Hey you, why would you steal this?

30:44.442 --> 30:46.103
I always wanted to go to Paris.

30:49.614 --> 30:51.104
You know what? It's a beautiful city.

30:51.282 --> 30:54.217
If you ever make it, you should get a
snow globe because this is Seattle.

30:54.385 --> 30:57.752
That's the Space Needle,
not the Eiffel Tower, you schmuck.

30:57.922 --> 30:58.946
What is this?

30:59.824 --> 31:03.920
- Memory card for a digital camera?
- I know. It was in the snow globe.

31:04.095 --> 31:05.926
Where did you steal
the snow globe?

31:06.097 --> 31:08.122
At the risk of me incriminating myself
any further

31:08.299 --> 31:10.358
I've hit so many places
it's impossible to say.

31:10.802 --> 31:11.826
Huh.

31:12.003 --> 31:13.937
You think that that's what the guy
is looking for?

31:14.105 --> 31:16.130
There's only one way to find out.
Do me a favor.

31:16.307 --> 31:18.332
- Take him to the station.
Let's go.

31:19.077 --> 31:21.011
The memory card you found
is password protected.

31:21.212 --> 31:22.941
It looks like 64-bit encryption.

31:23.147 --> 31:24.341
Okay, can you crack it?

31:24.949 --> 31:26.610
Yeah, give me a couple minutes.

31:27.852 --> 31:28.876
Check this out.

31:30.121 --> 31:31.520
It looks like Johnny D's stalker.

31:31.723 --> 31:34.521
I had a sketch artist work up a
composite based on his description.

31:34.692 --> 31:37.718
H.P.D. showed it around the hotel.
Three employees reported seeing him

31:37.896 --> 31:39.591
around the time Baker
went over the balcony.

31:39.764 --> 31:40.788
It's our killer.

31:40.965 --> 31:43.092
But I haven't been able to
match the face to the name.

31:43.268 --> 31:47.602
All right, I got it. It looks like
one file on the card and it's a video.

31:47.772 --> 31:53.176
Hold on.
- Okay, it's time stamped, July 2008.

31:54.112 --> 31:56.171
Wait a minute. Go closer on that.

31:59.984 --> 32:02.043
I've seen her before.

32:02.253 --> 32:04.687
That's Lindsey Roberts.
She's a local girl from Aiea.

32:04.856 --> 32:07.222
She disappeared in the summer
of 2008.

32:07.392 --> 32:10.122
But there we no signs of foul play
so the case went cold,

32:10.295 --> 32:14.163
until they found her body at
Mokuleia National Forest Reserve.

32:14.332 --> 32:16.391
This was ten weeks
after they reported her missing.

32:16.567 --> 32:17.591
Killer was never found.

32:17.769 --> 32:21.227
Okay, if this video was made
right before Lindsey's disappearance

32:21.406 --> 32:23.840
then the mystery man in the video
could be her killer.

32:24.008 --> 32:25.976
That's why Alex Baker
was thrown off the balcony.

32:26.144 --> 32:27.907
That's why Johnny D's room
was searched.

32:28.079 --> 32:30.013
This guy is trying
to get back the evidence

32:30.181 --> 32:32.547
that could link him
to Lindsey's murder.

32:42.427 --> 32:43.985
Lindsey had this way about her.

32:45.530 --> 32:47.862
She just made everyone around her

32:48.733 --> 32:50.462
happier.

32:51.235 --> 32:55.467
Listen, I can't imagine
what you guys have been through.

32:58.076 --> 33:00.840
And I know even now
it must be really difficult to talk about.

33:01.012 --> 33:03.105
But we do have to
ask you a question.

33:03.314 --> 33:05.782
At the time of her disappearance,
was Lindsey involved

33:05.950 --> 33:07.542
in a relationship with anyone?

33:07.719 --> 33:10.119
Lindsey was in her first year
at UH Law.

33:10.321 --> 33:12.846
I mean between
school and her internship,

33:13.024 --> 33:14.753
there wasn't any time for boyfriends.

33:14.926 --> 33:16.257
Are you positive?

33:16.427 --> 33:20.295
We said all this to the police when
they took our statements the first time.

33:20.465 --> 33:22.296
Why are you asking about this now?

33:22.467 --> 33:24.230
There's something
that we need to show you.

33:25.970 --> 33:29.406
These photographs popped up
in an unrelated investigation.

33:29.574 --> 33:34.307
We know this was recorded four days
before Lindsey was reported missing.

33:36.981 --> 33:39.472
Either of you guys
recognize this guy.

33:40.385 --> 33:44.253
- Oh, my God.
- That's Davis. That's Richard Davis.

33:44.422 --> 33:46.083
He was Lindsey's boss.

33:47.091 --> 33:50.117
COD was blunt force trauma
to the back of the head.

33:50.294 --> 33:52.125
Left parietal bone
in Lindsey's skull fractured

33:52.296 --> 33:54.264
causing intracranial hemorrhaging.

33:54.432 --> 33:56.832
Were you able to determine
the murder weapon?

33:58.403 --> 34:01.304
- No.
- No? But...

34:01.472 --> 34:04.737
During the autopsy, we recovered
a wood fiber imbedded in the skull.

34:04.909 --> 34:07.901
The chief medical examiner
dismissed it as inconsequential.

34:08.379 --> 34:10.745
He explained that
the body was found in a forest

34:10.915 --> 34:13.475
so it stood to reason
that the wood could enter the wound.

34:13.650 --> 34:16.176
- But you disagreed?
- I was an assistant ME at that time.

34:16.387 --> 34:18.014
Only two months into the job.

34:18.188 --> 34:20.418
It wasn't my place
to challenge my superior.

34:20.591 --> 34:23.059
Dr. Gold made the ruling
and I respected it.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.022
But the question always
nagged at me.

34:32.937 --> 34:33.960
You kept it?

34:34.138 --> 34:37.039
Took me six months to save up
enough money for the testing.

34:38.409 --> 34:42.038
Spectroscopic analysis identified
the wood as northern white ash,

34:42.213 --> 34:45.376
- approximately 60 years old.
- That does not sound native to Hawaii.

34:45.550 --> 34:47.108
Correct.

34:48.219 --> 34:50.152
It could be found in the Northeast.

34:50.321 --> 34:53.222
In fact, this particular genus
was grown exclusively

34:53.424 --> 34:55.358
by a New York lumber supplier
that provided wood

34:55.525 --> 34:57.824
for a variety of commercial products
in the '40s and '50s:

34:58.296 --> 35:00.594
rifle stock, golf clubs
and, uh, picture frames.

35:00.965 --> 35:03.126
But the top account at that time
was Schuster & Mills,

35:03.301 --> 35:06.429
an athletic company
whose top seller was...

35:07.405 --> 35:10.932
Wait a minute. Are you saying we're
looking for a baseball bat from the '50s?

35:11.109 --> 35:12.201
Possibly, yes.

35:13.077 --> 35:16.171
- Come on. You're a genius, Max.
- Thank you.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.439
- What is this?
- Search warrant.

35:20.218 --> 35:21.549
Richard Davis.

35:21.719 --> 35:24.051
- What's going on?
- Hands behind your back, please.

35:24.222 --> 35:25.814
You have the right to remain silent.

35:25.990 --> 35:29.016
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

35:29.193 --> 35:31.024
You have the right to speak
to an attorney...

35:32.263 --> 35:33.855
This bat must have cost a fortune.

35:34.031 --> 35:37.523
It was made to kill pitches,
not pretty young women.

35:38.035 --> 35:39.297
What are you talking about?

35:39.470 --> 35:42.906
Lindsey Roberts died from
a blow to the head with a blunt object.

35:43.074 --> 35:45.338
There was a wood fragment
embedded in her skull.

35:45.510 --> 35:49.810
I'm betting the tests are gonna prove
that that fragment came from this bat.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.006
This is absurd.

35:52.350 --> 35:55.376
Lindsey Roberts was an intern
at my firm for maybe a couple months

35:55.553 --> 35:56.577
before she disappeared.

35:56.754 --> 36:00.622
Now, what happened to her is tragic,
but I had nothing to do with it.

36:00.791 --> 36:03.225
- You weren't having an affair with her?
- No.

36:08.099 --> 36:10.226
This is you and Lindsey.

36:10.601 --> 36:12.262
How do you explain this?

36:13.404 --> 36:15.736
Why don't you explain this?

36:16.007 --> 36:17.235
I didn't kill her.

36:18.042 --> 36:19.703
Are you really still trying
to deny this?

36:19.877 --> 36:22.971
I swear, I didn't kill her.
I couldn't have.

36:23.147 --> 36:24.580
I loved her.

36:29.921 --> 36:31.650
We were in a relationship.

36:31.822 --> 36:33.084
Yeah, I admit it.

36:35.159 --> 36:36.683
The bat is in my trophy case.

36:36.861 --> 36:39.352
The photo,
where did you get that photo?

36:39.530 --> 36:41.623
They're stills from
the little home video you made.

36:41.866 --> 36:42.890
Let me ask you something.

36:43.067 --> 36:45.228
Did Lindsey even know
that you were recording her?

36:45.403 --> 36:49.305
No. No. I didn't. That's me, yes.
It's my office.

36:49.473 --> 36:53.409
But I never made a video.
I wouldn't do that to her.

36:57.548 --> 36:58.947
Something you guys gotta see.

37:00.785 --> 37:03.447
One week after Lindsey disappears

37:03.621 --> 37:06.522
five calls from Davis' direct line
at work to her cell phone.

37:06.691 --> 37:08.784
Why would he be calling her
if he knew she was dead?

37:08.960 --> 37:10.825
Exactly.
So we did a little more digging.

37:10.995 --> 37:13.156
Davis' wife Anne
used to be a public school teacher,

37:13.331 --> 37:16.232
which means she had to undergo a
background check. I ran her fingerprints

37:16.400 --> 37:18.891
against the ones we lifted
off the SD card. It's a match.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.197
Did a little digging
in Anne Davis' financials.

37:21.372 --> 37:25.672
She writes a check to her personal
trainer for $500 every single month.

37:25.843 --> 37:29.108
A couple days ago
he gets a bonus check, $10,000.

37:29.280 --> 37:31.373
That's right?
So we did background on this guy.

37:31.582 --> 37:33.812
Paolo Bell, 37. He's got a record.

37:33.985 --> 37:36.681
Aggravated robbery and
multiple weapons charges, battery.

37:36.854 --> 37:37.878
That's a familiar face.

37:38.055 --> 37:40.853
That's because he matches
the sketch that you had mocked up

37:41.025 --> 37:44.517
of our suspect
based on Johnny D's description.

37:44.729 --> 37:46.890
We just found Anne's hired muscle.

37:47.665 --> 37:49.826
Five-0. Hey!
Hands where we can see them.

37:50.801 --> 37:53.793
You're under arrest
for the murder of Alex Baker.

38:09.754 --> 38:12.154
When did you learn
of your husband's affair with Lindsey?

38:12.323 --> 38:15.486
I'm not answering any more of your
questions until my attorney's here.

38:26.704 --> 38:28.262
Excuse me.

38:28.439 --> 38:31.806
Mrs. Davis has decided
to exercise her right to remain silent.

38:32.543 --> 38:35.569
Unfortunately for Mrs. Davis,
we just picked up her friend Mr. Bell,

38:35.746 --> 38:38.840
and he was in a much chattier mood.

38:39.016 --> 38:42.247
It's his word but he said
that you gave him $10,000,

38:42.920 --> 38:44.854
to retrieve some stolen property.

38:45.022 --> 38:48.287
In particular a snow globe that
you said had great sentimental value.

38:48.459 --> 38:52.361
You know the guy wasn't even aware
that it had evidence of a murder on it?

38:52.963 --> 38:55.591
So for all intents and purposes,

38:55.766 --> 38:58.234
Alex Baker, an innocent man,

38:58.402 --> 39:02.168
was thrown off of a balcony
for a snow globe.

39:08.879 --> 39:11.746
Anne, what really happened?

39:18.723 --> 39:22.215
When I first suspected
Richard was having an affair

39:23.327 --> 39:26.319
I needed to know the truth.

39:26.964 --> 39:29.728
So I set up a hidden camera
in his office.

39:29.900 --> 39:32.391
Did you confront your husband
with the proof?

39:33.637 --> 39:36.128
No, I never told him I knew.

39:36.974 --> 39:40.410
That night I e-mailed Lindsey
from his computer.

39:40.878 --> 39:43.210
Asked her to come over.

39:44.982 --> 39:47.507
I just wanted to talk.

39:48.919 --> 39:52.446
But then she admitted
that she was in love with him.

39:54.358 --> 39:58.021
And that he was gonna leave me
so they could be together.

40:00.297 --> 40:02.857
I don't know what happened.

40:03.834 --> 40:06.325
I just saw the bat and I...

40:08.539 --> 40:10.598
I didn't mean to kill her.

40:11.509 --> 40:14.444
I didn't mean to kill her.

40:19.150 --> 40:20.481
Book her, Danno.

40:22.119 --> 40:24.519
<i>We now take you to
the conference already in progress</i>

40:24.688 --> 40:26.315
<i>at the home
of Lindsey Roberts' parents.</i>

40:26.490 --> 40:29.516
<i>On behalf of Lindsey
and our entire family,</i>

40:29.693 --> 40:31.957
<i>we'd just like to thank
the Five-0 task force</i>

40:32.129 --> 40:34.188
<i>and the Honolulu
Police Department.</i>

40:34.365 --> 40:36.356
<i>Because of their hard work,
we can now move forward</i>

40:36.534 --> 40:39.469
<i>knowing justice will be served.</i>

41:22.713 --> 41:26.615
What makes you think I won't kill you
right here in this restaurant?

41:28.219 --> 41:32.246
"The man who strikes first
admits that his ideas have given out."

41:32.423 --> 41:34.220
Old Chinese proverb.

41:34.959 --> 41:37.427
"Say hello to my little friend."

41:40.564 --> 41:42.589
Old American proverb.

41:45.736 --> 41:47.397
Do you honestly believe
I'd come here

41:47.571 --> 41:49.732
without some assurance
of my safety?

41:55.546 --> 41:57.377
Where's Agent Kaye?

41:57.915 --> 42:00.475
Heading east on
Kapiolani Boulevard.

42:00.651 --> 42:02.915
Driving a silver Malibu.

42:03.087 --> 42:04.748
But who can really say?

42:05.990 --> 42:10.791
In any case, I'm sure
she'll make it here without incident.

42:23.741 --> 42:25.174
What do you want?

42:25.809 --> 42:28.972
To know the man
who is trying to know me.

42:29.146 --> 42:32.013
Well, what I know is that
Hiro and Hesse both answer to you,

42:32.182 --> 42:36.141
which means at the very least, you're
an accomplice to my parents' murder.

42:36.320 --> 42:38.914
And at the most,
you're directly responsible.

42:40.991 --> 42:42.322
Interesting theory.

42:42.493 --> 42:46.088
If that theory pans out,
I promise you

42:46.263 --> 42:50.893
I will find you and next time
it will be on my terms.

42:51.969 --> 42:54.494
A little friendly advice.

42:55.639 --> 42:58.631
I wouldn't dig too deeply
into your family's past.

43:00.010 --> 43:02.535
You might not like what you find.

43:08.419 --> 43:10.216
Dinner's on me.
