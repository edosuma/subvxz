A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:14.347 --> 00:16.891
<i>That woman</i>
<i>was at the salon yesterday.</i>

00:16.975 --> 00:20.270
<i>And guess what?</i> <i>She agrees with me.</i>

00:20.353 --> 00:24.566
<i>That here in Miami, with your talent,</i>
<i>you'd do very, very well.</i>

00:24.649 --> 00:26.609
Mama, I would do great here too.

00:27.402 --> 00:30.280
We just need Pure Street to take off.

00:30.363 --> 00:33.867
<i>Oh honey,</i>
<i>I know that they're your friends</i>

00:33.950 --> 00:36.119
<i>and that you feel bad about leaving,</i>

00:36.202 --> 00:38.329
<i>but time doesn't move backwards.</i>

00:43.251 --> 00:45.086
You know what? Get me that letter.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.087
<i>Are you sure?</i>

00:47.380 --> 00:49.299
Yeah, do it. Let's go all the way.

00:49.382 --> 00:52.427
But I'm still kinda busy,
so I'll call you later, okay?

00:53.011 --> 00:54.512
I love you.

00:55.680 --> 00:58.433
So, Ximena, you bailing on us?

01:01.853 --> 01:04.981
You think we can still make it with
Pure Street after what happened to us?

01:06.524 --> 01:10.153
Yes. Come to the Dembow,
I want to tell you something.

01:11.112 --> 01:12.739
Hurry up, everyone else is here.

01:13.573 --> 01:16.242
Girls, we need to talk about the trip.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.707
Pure Street is going to Medellín.

01:32.092 --> 01:32.926
Hey, Ma…

01:35.762 --> 01:37.305
I need to ask you a favor.

01:39.974 --> 01:41.142
I need a loan.

01:45.688 --> 01:48.525
You want me to give you money
after what you've done?

01:50.985 --> 01:53.780
It wasn't my fault,
I've told you a thousand times.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.407
I had nothing to do with it. Really.

01:56.491 --> 01:59.327
I don't know what else to say
to get you to believe me.

02:02.997 --> 02:05.333
-Ma, I swear I won't ask you again.
-No.

02:06.668 --> 02:07.502
Please, Ma.

02:08.753 --> 02:11.089
Look, if I do well,

02:11.172 --> 02:12.882
I'll be able to pay you back
what I borrow.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.759
Look, if you need money, get a job.

02:14.843 --> 02:17.011
Or study something serious.

02:17.512 --> 02:20.807
I'm not going to keep supporting
that Royal insanity.

02:27.772 --> 02:30.692
INCOMING CALL

02:30.775 --> 02:31.609
<i>Hello?</i>

02:33.194 --> 02:34.237
Three million pesos.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.282
Are you crazy?

02:37.365 --> 02:38.741
<i>That's a lot of money.</i>

02:39.242 --> 02:42.162
Okay. If that works for you, great.
Otherwise…

02:45.165 --> 02:45.999
<i>Think about it.</i>

02:46.082 --> 02:47.542
Then let me know, okay?

02:48.376 --> 02:49.419
Please, God.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.413
Go again. This time, do it right.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.114
Wake up, wake up.

04:41.197 --> 04:43.533
Okay, girls,
be alert over there, all right?

04:43.616 --> 04:45.576
Keep rehearsing. I'll be there tonight.

04:45.660 --> 04:48.579
When I get there later,
I'll catch up with you guys, okay?

04:48.663 --> 04:49.497
See you later.

04:54.252 --> 04:55.503
Karina, come here.

04:57.046 --> 04:58.798
What the fuck happened last night?

05:01.175 --> 05:04.387
-Do you think I'm stupid or what?
-No, how can you say that?

05:04.470 --> 05:07.432
Yesterday something came up
with my brother. Didn't have time to call.

05:07.515 --> 05:09.142
Anyway, the money I asked you to lend me--

05:09.225 --> 05:12.729
You have lost any privileges
you might have had with me.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.523
-You can forget about the loan check.
-Okay.

05:15.606 --> 05:16.691
So, go with Pinilla,

05:17.567 --> 05:21.279
and tell him that effective immediately,
on my orders, you two will trade posts.

05:21.362 --> 05:22.613
I don't want to do that again.

05:22.697 --> 05:24.991
I don't give a fuck
if you want to or not. You have to.

05:25.575 --> 05:29.120
If that works for you, good.
Otherwise, you know what to do, Karina.

05:29.203 --> 05:31.789
I have a long list
of capable young women

05:31.873 --> 05:33.958
who would gladly
give up a hand or more

05:34.042 --> 05:35.376
to be able to work here with me.

05:36.711 --> 05:37.545
Go.

05:38.296 --> 05:39.839
Go talk to Pinilla. Go on.

05:44.427 --> 05:47.221
-I have no idea what you're talking about.
-<i>The money in my purse.</i>

05:47.305 --> 05:50.391
-Ugh, Ma, really?
-<i>I had that money this morning.</i>

05:50.475 --> 05:53.644
Well, I don't know, check again.
And Ma, I'm hanging up.

05:53.728 --> 05:55.563
I'm already late for rehearsal.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.410
Hey, brother.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.580
Okay, men out. It's the girls' turn.

06:55.456 --> 06:56.582
Vincent.

06:59.377 --> 07:01.212
I see you're having trouble
with your knee.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.297
If you can't keep up during rehearsals,

07:03.381 --> 07:05.967
I don't know what else we're going to do
with the rest of the play.

07:07.135 --> 07:07.969
Go.

07:10.388 --> 07:12.557
The class begins at eight.
Please, come on.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.018
Yes, I know. Sorry.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.854
Well, if you're aware, then please leave.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.272
Go.

07:19.355 --> 07:21.691
I think you might be
going a little overboard, sir.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.570
-Oh really? You think I am?
-Yeah.

07:27.155 --> 07:30.950
Just to be extra clear, starting tomorrow,
anyone who arrives late

07:31.033 --> 07:33.327
will not only be required
to leave the rehearsal,

07:33.411 --> 07:34.996
but to leave the play entirely.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.540
Is that better for you?

07:41.085 --> 07:44.172
Antonia, please let us work. Let's go.

08:03.858 --> 08:07.361
-Okay, okay, stop.
-There was just a little bit left.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.405
-Let me help.
-It's almost done.

08:10.615 --> 08:11.491
Pinilla.

08:12.658 --> 08:13.618
Back to your post.

08:14.577 --> 08:15.995
Leave her. She can do it herself.

08:18.539 --> 08:20.791
-I'll be right back.
-Cool.

08:31.093 --> 08:33.221
María José, the question is,

08:33.304 --> 08:36.098
do you still want to have
the main role or not?

08:36.182 --> 08:37.141
Of course I do.

08:37.225 --> 08:41.020
Well then, if I'm making the others
put 100% effort into this,

08:41.103 --> 08:42.688
I need ten times more from you.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.026
Jacob, can I talk to you?

08:47.610 --> 08:48.736
Yeah, talk.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.823
I wanted to apologize
for the way I reacted yesterday.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.743
-I wanted to say--
-Antonia, get to the point. What's up?

08:57.203 --> 08:58.913
To show you that I'm good.

08:58.996 --> 09:03.960
Miranda told me you were a great artist
and truthfully, I haven't seen it yet.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.045
Okay.

09:08.422 --> 09:10.841
There's still the role
of the grandma left.

09:10.925 --> 09:12.718
If you're interested,
prepare it for tomorrow.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.149
-Hello?
-Hey, princess.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.818
Be in the neighborhood at 5:00.

09:30.194 --> 09:31.028
Okay.

09:31.696 --> 09:32.863
And bring the money.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.620
-Uncle…
-<i>How are you?</i>

09:40.121 --> 09:42.206
<i>I just got the results from the X-ray,</i>

09:42.290 --> 09:45.960
<i>and your knee looks worse.</i>
<i>Be careful, all right?</i>

09:46.043 --> 09:48.754
Thanks, uncle.
And please don't tell my parents.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.923
<i>Sure, kid, but you need to talk to them.</i>

10:02.018 --> 10:03.936
That's why I like the work of…
What's your name?

10:04.020 --> 10:05.313
María José.

10:05.396 --> 10:08.941
<i>You can tell she's humble and</i>
<i>that's what I'm looking for. Humbleness.</i>

10:09.900 --> 10:12.153
<i>Stop complaining and try harder.</i>

10:12.236 --> 10:14.989
<i>If I'm making the others</i>
<i>put 100% effort in this,</i>

10:15.072 --> 10:16.782
<i>I need ten times more from you.</i>

10:26.334 --> 10:28.919
I can't believe
how much I dislike that guy.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.004
How are you?

10:31.130 --> 10:32.131
How do you think?

10:35.134 --> 10:35.968
Good afternoon.

11:18.052 --> 11:18.886
What's up?

11:19.845 --> 11:21.472
-What's up?
-Bring the money?

11:22.098 --> 11:22.932
Yeah.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.109
What is this?

11:34.402 --> 11:38.280
Well, it's what I was able to get
while you keep your end of the deal.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.699
That wasn't part of the deal.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.828
The deal wasn't
three million pesos, either.

11:47.707 --> 11:51.711
You want it, or would you rather
give it back and leave things here?

11:52.545 --> 11:53.379
Let's go.

12:05.099 --> 12:05.933
Wait here.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.695
-Hey.
-What's good?

12:17.778 --> 12:20.656
-What's going on?
-Straightening the home. It's crooked.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.615
And Grandma?

12:21.699 --> 12:25.202
Oh, uh, she went to the store.
She was, like, a little…

12:25.286 --> 12:26.120
Excuse me.

12:26.203 --> 12:27.621
I told you to wait.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.582
-Oh, okay…
-Isn't this the girl who…?

12:29.665 --> 12:31.792
She's no one.
Leave, you're late for work.

12:31.876 --> 12:35.254
And if you see the girls,
watch what you tell them, okay?

12:36.297 --> 12:38.174
Okay, yeah, for sure.

12:38.257 --> 12:39.800
-Be careful, yeah?
-Yeah.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.051
Okay, come on.

12:46.182 --> 12:49.059
Next time I tell you
to do something, do it. Got it?

12:51.604 --> 12:52.438
And that's…?

12:52.521 --> 12:54.356
-My brother.
-Oh.

12:54.940 --> 12:55.983
Did he recognize me?

12:56.567 --> 12:58.569
Why do you think
I asked you not to come in?

12:58.652 --> 13:00.654
Oh man, this isn't good.

13:00.738 --> 13:03.199
Don't worry,
he's not gonna say anything about it.

13:03.282 --> 13:04.283
What'd you bring?

13:05.701 --> 13:07.953
-Can I open it?
-Yeah.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.039
Let's take a look.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.541
Do you two live here on your own?

13:13.292 --> 13:14.502
No, with my grandma.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.338
And your parents?

13:19.340 --> 13:21.258
You ask a lot of questions, don't you?

13:24.386 --> 13:26.430
I'll answer so you stop being curious.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.766
My father, mm…

13:28.849 --> 13:30.726
Well, you don't know anything about him.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.771
-Same for me.
-And my mom's been in Spain two years.

13:34.730 --> 13:36.065
Oh, that's great.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.025
She was caught with drugs.

13:42.613 --> 13:44.031
Damn, sorry.

13:44.615 --> 13:47.493
It's fine.
What'd you say the scholarship was for?

13:47.576 --> 13:48.828
To continue at Royal.

13:49.453 --> 13:51.205
The only thing I want is

13:51.288 --> 13:52.122
to dance.

13:55.417 --> 13:56.544
Will it work?

13:56.627 --> 14:01.507
Well, it's not bad,
but I can lend you some clothes of mine

14:01.590 --> 14:04.051
so you'll look different, and not so…

14:05.594 --> 14:06.762
like you.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.099
Okay.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.809
Is there a problem with that?

14:11.892 --> 14:14.645
No, no, I'm fine.
I'm cool. Thanks, actually.

15:29.803 --> 15:32.264
You know what?
I didn't give you any earrings.

15:32.348 --> 15:33.849
You can wear mine if you want.

15:34.308 --> 15:35.309
-Here.
-You sure?

15:35.392 --> 15:36.226
Yeah.

15:37.311 --> 15:38.479
All right, look…

15:39.939 --> 15:41.273
Here, we're all equal.

15:41.357 --> 15:45.152
We're all a family, and so
we stick together for better or for worse.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.905
If there's a fight,
then we're all gonna be there.

15:47.988 --> 15:49.782
And for other things too.

15:50.574 --> 15:54.745
So relax, take it easy, and if someone
talks to you, says hi or whatever,

15:55.579 --> 15:56.789
treat them well.

15:57.373 --> 16:00.000
I'm gonna look for the girls,
see where they're at. Okay?

16:00.084 --> 16:00.918
Karina,

16:02.002 --> 16:05.631
don't forget that, for the plan to work,
you can't tell them anything.

16:07.007 --> 16:08.384
It'll be all right.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.343
Thanks.

16:12.596 --> 16:15.766
What's up, old man?
Family, how's it goin'? How was it?

16:35.619 --> 16:36.954
Be back soon.

16:42.292 --> 16:43.419
Antonia Pombo.

16:44.878 --> 16:47.464
Well, isn't this a meet-cute here.

16:47.548 --> 16:48.382
See?

16:49.049 --> 16:51.260
I just knew we made a connection
back then.

16:51.969 --> 16:54.513
Coming all the way here
to watch me play soccer…

16:55.389 --> 16:56.223
So sweet.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.978
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?

17:01.061 --> 17:02.563
And why wouldn't I be?

17:05.607 --> 17:06.942
Why did you come then?

17:08.068 --> 17:09.153
I was invited.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.030
Who?

17:11.655 --> 17:12.489
Karina.

17:13.073 --> 17:15.117
-Karina?
-Yep.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.035
We're friends.

17:17.327 --> 17:19.955
Do you really think
I'm gonna believe that?

17:21.665 --> 17:22.499
And why not?

17:25.502 --> 17:28.297
Okay. Two nights ago,
you didn't know each other.

17:28.380 --> 17:31.508
Weren't you the one asking who Karina was
and how you could get in touch with her?

17:31.592 --> 17:33.385
That was only because…

17:33.469 --> 17:35.721
Okay, well, what are you
dressed like that for then?

17:37.014 --> 17:38.474
What's wrong with my clothes?

17:39.475 --> 17:41.268
Nothing, they actually look good on you.

17:41.351 --> 17:43.854
But I've seen those clothes before.

17:43.937 --> 17:46.315
Those aren't your clothes, are they?

17:48.609 --> 17:49.651
No answer?

17:50.819 --> 17:52.404
Then what are we doing here?

17:52.488 --> 17:53.447
I'm outta here.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.074
-Good luck.
-No, wait.

17:59.995 --> 18:01.997
Karina and I have business together.

18:03.540 --> 18:06.543
Well, she's going to help me
with something, and…

18:07.419 --> 18:10.297
it's important that no one knows about it.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.800
What business?

18:14.134 --> 18:15.761
So, can you tell me about it?

18:16.929 --> 18:17.763
No.

18:19.389 --> 18:22.434
I mean, at-- at least not now.
Maybe later I will.

18:23.310 --> 18:25.229
Aw, blondie!

18:25.813 --> 18:29.066
I thought you brought me out here
to share something more than a secret.

18:31.693 --> 18:32.528
I have to go.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.488
No, no, come on.

18:34.571 --> 18:35.906
Wait, wait, wait.

18:37.741 --> 18:39.326
If I decide to stay quiet,

18:40.494 --> 18:42.955
not say nothing, I keep your secret,

18:44.581 --> 18:45.916
what'll you do for me?

18:49.461 --> 18:50.295
Nothing.

18:51.213 --> 18:53.215
-Nothing?
-I'm not giving you anything.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.760
But you still owe me a drink.

18:57.636 --> 18:58.470
A drink?

19:16.196 --> 19:18.198
I'm only going
for a little while.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.658
Everyone's at the court.

19:20.826 --> 19:23.245
I'll go.
I'll close the salon and come back.

19:23.328 --> 19:24.329
Yeah, I'm coming.

19:36.049 --> 19:39.261
-Where were you?
-Behind there, looking around.

19:39.344 --> 19:42.514
Focus, because these girls
are very crafty.

19:42.598 --> 19:43.807
You'll see, okay?

19:44.391 --> 19:45.559
How's it goin'?

19:45.642 --> 19:47.811
-Look, isn't it beautiful?
-Very pretty.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.730
-Nothing?
-Nothing. She has high standards.

19:49.813 --> 19:52.774
Antonia, this is Bombita. She's a model.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.484
-Hi.
-Yeah, a sock model.

19:55.903 --> 19:58.363
Her brother Checho
doesn't like that she's a model.

19:59.948 --> 20:01.658
<i>Bombita's in charge</i>
<i>of choreography.</i>

20:01.742 --> 20:03.118
<i>Oh wow.</i>

20:03.202 --> 20:05.537
<i>She's crazy,</i>
<i>but I think she's from another planet.</i>

20:06.538 --> 20:09.291
<i>She loves wigs</i>
<i>more than anything else in life.</i>

20:10.334 --> 20:13.170
-Mm.
-And she's a great, great friend.

20:13.253 --> 20:15.005
-Pleasure.
-Likewise.

20:15.547 --> 20:18.842
This is Chama. She is the best
at twerking in the neighborhood.

20:18.926 --> 20:21.094
She can really shake it.

20:21.845 --> 20:24.514
<i>And she does deliveries</i>
<i>to help out her family in Venezuela.</i>

20:24.598 --> 20:25.766
<i>She's amazing.</i>

20:33.023 --> 20:34.316
Nice to meet you.

20:36.109 --> 20:39.029
-Ximena here?
-Not yet. She's still at the beauty salon.

20:40.697 --> 20:42.908
<i>Ximena is our stylist.</i>

20:42.991 --> 20:46.703
<i>The high heels, the wigs,</i>
<i>wardrobe, make-up…</i>

20:46.787 --> 20:47.913
<i>And drama.</i>

20:47.996 --> 20:50.374
<i>-She's the best at that.</i>
-<i>She's like the mom of hair.</i>

20:50.457 --> 20:52.542
What about you two?

20:54.795 --> 20:56.421
We met, uh…

20:56.505 --> 21:00.342
We worked at the shoe warehouse
before I started working at the factory.

21:00.425 --> 21:03.136
-We were there for what… six months?
-A year.

21:04.304 --> 21:05.472
No, it was six months, no?

21:05.555 --> 21:07.724
Well, sort of,

21:07.808 --> 21:10.644
because I sometimes
would be a replacement,

21:10.727 --> 21:12.813
-uh, here and there.
-Yeah, she was in and out.

21:12.896 --> 21:14.064
Exactly, yeah.

21:14.147 --> 21:14.982
Yeah, right.

21:16.191 --> 21:17.317
Hey.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.284
Hello.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.246
My friend told me about this neighborhood.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.457
But right when we were about
to start rehearsal,

22:13.540 --> 22:17.294
I saw a place just like this, actually.
With a soccer field too.

22:17.377 --> 22:20.088
It's similar, so I thought
it'd be a good idea to come and see.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.049
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

22:22.132 --> 22:23.717
Let's make this very clear.

22:24.426 --> 22:26.386
What the fuck kind of game
are you playing?

22:26.470 --> 22:29.514
I'm not playing any games.
I told you I didn't bring him.

22:30.265 --> 22:31.725
Do you think I'm stupid?

22:31.808 --> 22:34.186
After all that's happened,
why would I bring him here?

22:34.269 --> 22:35.270
He has to leave.

22:35.354 --> 22:38.023
Or I'll get in trouble, and they'll
kick you out of the neighborhood.

22:38.106 --> 22:38.982
Okay.

22:39.066 --> 22:41.985
We dance to urban music, all of us girls.

22:42.069 --> 22:43.028
Together?

22:43.737 --> 22:44.780
Well, uh…

22:45.447 --> 22:47.366
Not her. We just met her.

22:48.075 --> 22:50.744
-Ah, so she's not a friend of yours?
-No, she's friends with Karina.

22:51.787 --> 22:54.039
Ah. And where'd they meet?

22:54.664 --> 22:56.541
I don't know.
They said they sold shoes together.

22:56.625 --> 22:57.542
They sold shoes?

22:58.668 --> 22:59.503
Ah.

23:02.339 --> 23:03.298
So, what?

23:04.007 --> 23:04.966
You buying us beer?

23:05.926 --> 23:08.428
Drinking by yourself is pretty boring,
don't you think?

23:09.012 --> 23:10.847
You're right.
Do you want me to buy you a beer?

23:10.931 --> 23:13.809
-Yeah, I'll go with you, help you.
-Anyone else?

23:14.726 --> 23:15.936
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

23:17.104 --> 23:18.688
Want something else besides beer?

23:18.772 --> 23:21.525
I do. But first, just a beer.

23:22.651 --> 23:23.860
-Let's go.
-Okay.

23:23.944 --> 23:26.405
-What's up with you?
-He's really hot.

23:26.947 --> 23:30.117
So what's the name of the shop
where you sold shoes?

23:30.992 --> 23:33.662
The multicolored shoe line
that you invented?

23:35.163 --> 23:37.541
-Why are you here?
-Calm down.

23:38.166 --> 23:40.502
-Are you following me again?
-Yes.

23:40.585 --> 23:44.756
I was worried. You've been acting strange,
so I followed you. I'm worried about you.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.216
What's up, girl?

23:46.716 --> 23:48.176
God. You again?

23:48.260 --> 23:52.055
Look at this fool. You're the one
who's lost, man. What are you doing here?

23:52.139 --> 23:54.599
-It's fine.
-Why I'm here is none of your business.

23:54.683 --> 23:57.018
-Everything's fine. Just leave.
-Are you all right?

23:57.102 --> 23:59.771
-Yes I'm fine, please…
-You need anything, I'm around.

23:59.855 --> 24:03.733
Buddy, you better watch your step.
You're in the wrong part of town, homie.

24:06.570 --> 24:08.780
So that dumb fuckface
is threatening me now?

24:11.408 --> 24:13.660
-Who's that?
-The hottie?

24:13.743 --> 24:14.870
No, the girl.

24:14.953 --> 24:16.538
Ah, a friend of Karina.

24:17.164 --> 24:18.582
How'd it go with your uncle?

24:20.083 --> 24:21.793
Same as always, dude.

24:21.877 --> 24:24.379
Can you at least explain
what the hell you're doing here?

24:25.172 --> 24:28.091
What are you doing dressed like that,
here, with these people?

24:28.175 --> 24:29.718
This is nuts. What's the deal?

24:33.263 --> 24:35.098
You got me into all this, okay?

24:35.182 --> 24:37.142
I know what I did to you was shitty.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.144
I messed up.

24:39.895 --> 24:40.729
I'm sorry.

24:42.856 --> 24:43.690
I love you.

24:43.773 --> 24:44.691
No.

24:45.901 --> 24:48.653
Sir, please,
can you give me a bottle of tequila?

24:50.780 --> 24:52.908
-So what's the plan?
-Thank you.

24:52.991 --> 24:56.161
To dress up as a reggaeton singer
to get the scholarship?

24:58.580 --> 24:59.789
He's paying.

25:07.756 --> 25:09.007
And where's the hottie?

25:10.759 --> 25:12.260
Oh, he has to leave.

25:17.307 --> 25:19.351
But he gave us this.

25:19.434 --> 25:21.520
Ah, delicious.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.355
She's Ximena, who I told you about.

25:24.231 --> 25:25.524
Nice to meet you.

25:25.607 --> 25:27.567
No worries, I already know who you are.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.027
Oh yeah?

25:29.110 --> 25:30.654
Shall we get a place or what?

I knew I'd seen you somewhere before.

26:40.890 --> 26:41.808
Where?

26:41.891 --> 26:44.686
Social media. You're Lupita.

26:48.648 --> 26:49.816
Why didn't you text me?

26:56.114 --> 26:57.365
It's on the house.

26:57.449 --> 26:58.325
Mm.

27:08.168 --> 27:09.919
What's up?

27:11.504 --> 27:14.758
It's pretty weird to see men like you
at a place like this.

27:20.138 --> 27:22.515
You know what
the worst mistake people make is?

27:23.350 --> 27:24.184
What?

27:24.768 --> 27:26.686
Being guided by prejudice.

27:29.147 --> 27:30.190
Hey, Álex.

27:30.273 --> 27:31.733
It's all good, it's all good.

27:32.275 --> 27:33.860
Got to get back to work now.

27:33.943 --> 27:37.947
Well, we can have a beer some other time
with no prejudice, right?

27:38.031 --> 27:39.949
-Right.
-Álex.

27:41.576 --> 27:42.827
What if I text you?

27:44.204 --> 27:45.038
What then?

27:46.915 --> 27:47.749
Text me.

27:58.927 --> 28:00.095
Daddy has to pay!

28:00.178 --> 28:03.306
-Hey, you have to pay for--
-Hey, wait. Go get a drink. Here.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.058
Thanks, baby. Lando!

28:05.141 --> 28:06.226
Bring one, please.

28:07.018 --> 28:08.144
All good, thanks.

28:08.228 --> 28:11.147
You're so lucky
to get yourself a girlfriend so fast.

28:13.441 --> 28:15.568
Wait a minute, what are you talking about?

28:16.152 --> 28:18.321
Look, Checho,
don't be playing dumb with me.

28:18.405 --> 28:20.198
I saw you getting off the bus
with that bitch.

28:20.281 --> 28:22.409
Ah, all right. And what then?

28:23.159 --> 28:24.577
Are you mad at me, or what?

28:24.661 --> 28:27.205
For real, I'm…
I'm just asking you a question.

28:27.288 --> 28:28.748
-Ah, no.
-Answer it, all right?

28:28.832 --> 28:31.042
It's a question
that I don't have to answer.

28:31.126 --> 28:33.878
-And you know that.
-What's that supposed to mean, huh?

28:33.962 --> 28:34.796
You…

28:34.879 --> 28:36.297
You gotta stop being hysterical

28:36.381 --> 28:38.758
and so damn paranoid all the time,
so jealous.

28:40.051 --> 28:42.887
Any girl that comes anywhere near me,
so I wanna do her?

28:42.971 --> 28:44.472
-Don't you?
-No!

28:44.556 --> 28:46.057
Obviously not, Ximena.

28:47.517 --> 28:48.476
You want my advice?

28:49.769 --> 28:50.937
Grow the hell up, all right?

28:51.020 --> 28:52.981
Hey, don't come here
and tell me that bullshit.

28:53.064 --> 28:55.984
-Get out of here. Go.
-Hey, come on. We're getting a drink.

28:56.484 --> 28:59.195
-Yes.
-What is it? You like the blondie or what?

28:59.279 --> 29:00.822
Well here, take it.

29:01.781 --> 29:02.615
Cheers.

29:02.699 --> 29:04.325
-Do it!
-Cheers, girls!

29:04.909 --> 29:05.869
Karina.

29:07.245 --> 29:08.371
Come here.

29:08.455 --> 29:09.914
-Hey, Chama!
-Hey, come here!

29:09.998 --> 29:12.459
-Pour, here. Bottoms up.
-Karina, want a drink?

29:12.542 --> 29:14.461
-Ah, there she goes!
-Karina,

29:14.544 --> 29:15.628
my friend, my sister,

29:15.712 --> 29:18.590
told me I had to treat you
as if you were a part of this group.

29:18.673 --> 29:20.467
But until I see you like this… Look.

29:20.550 --> 29:22.218
Mami, ay!

29:25.764 --> 29:27.891
Accept you as part of the group,
all right?

29:27.974 --> 29:30.769
Hey, papi, play that shit loud.
Uh-huh, yeah, go on!

29:33.688 --> 29:36.775
You know what? I'm gonna give you
something for your whole vibe.

29:36.858 --> 29:39.360
I know just what you need. Uh-huh.

29:47.494 --> 29:48.495
Go ahead.

29:50.163 --> 29:50.997
Um…

29:51.080 --> 29:53.291
Sweetie, come on. It's all right.

29:53.875 --> 29:56.044
You're part of this now. Come on.

29:57.003 --> 30:00.089
Don't you want to be part of this group?
Don't you like us?

30:06.221 --> 30:09.724
-Okay, here you go. Yeah, come on.
-Let's go.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.184
Work that ass, huh?

30:55.436 --> 30:59.065
Go on. Bring it on, do it.
Show us what you've got.

31:01.693 --> 31:04.445
Hey, hey, hey!

31:07.156 --> 31:08.658
Oh, lose the jacket, huh?

32:51.511 --> 32:54.722
No, but what am I supposed to do
if sales are down and there's less money?

32:56.349 --> 32:59.102
What, should I wear a sign
saying I sell heroin, or…?

33:00.561 --> 33:01.562
Look, old man…

33:02.188 --> 33:04.190
Calm down.
I'll find a way to get that money, okay?

33:40.935 --> 33:42.186
Yes, all good.

33:46.816 --> 33:48.735
Just relax. I'll figure something out.

33:49.235 --> 33:51.612
In fact, if you want to come over
to get money from last week,

33:51.696 --> 33:53.072
come by. I have it here.

33:55.575 --> 33:56.868
-Wait a second.
-Checho.

33:56.951 --> 33:59.287
-I'm leaving.
-No, wait. I'll drive you.

33:59.370 --> 34:01.706
Come on. We'll have a coffee first
and leave soon.

34:01.789 --> 34:05.752
Look, it's just I really have to go now.
If I'm late, I'm dead.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.839
Look, man, I'll hit you up later, okay?

34:10.339 --> 34:11.174
Let's go.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.849
-Let's go.
-Where's the helmet?

34:20.558 --> 34:23.227
Oh come on, it's totally fine.
Are you scared or what?

34:23.311 --> 34:25.772
-Well, yeah, kind of.
-Hold on tight, okay?

35:10.066 --> 35:11.943
-<i>All right.</i>
-<i>I owe you one.</i>

35:12.026 --> 35:13.486
I'll see you later.

35:13.569 --> 35:16.197
Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute.
Come on, really?

35:16.280 --> 35:19.492
I drive through the city to bring you here
and that's how you say goodbye?

35:22.954 --> 35:23.788
Thanks.

35:24.413 --> 35:25.414
See ya.

35:26.332 --> 35:27.375
Hi.

35:33.798 --> 35:36.259
What is it
that you're not connecting with?

35:36.759 --> 35:40.888
Do you realize that the woman
you're supposedly playing

35:41.472 --> 35:45.143
just found out that the only man
in the world that can make her happy

35:45.643 --> 35:47.854
is the one person
she can't get involved with?

35:47.937 --> 35:50.398
Do you understand how hard that is?

35:51.941 --> 35:53.651
Do you understand or not?

35:54.861 --> 35:55.695
Yes.

35:55.778 --> 35:56.737
Again.

35:57.864 --> 36:00.825
Romeo, Romeo,
wherefore art thou Romeo?

36:00.908 --> 36:02.368
Have you never been in love?

36:03.286 --> 36:05.913
-Never been let down or heartbroken?
-Stop!

36:06.998 --> 36:08.541
All right? Stop it.

36:12.086 --> 36:15.298
If you're not able to give me
what I need, I'll replace you.

36:15.381 --> 36:16.257
Period.

36:17.466 --> 36:19.177
Ten minute break.

36:20.219 --> 36:23.514
And you, please leave the class.
You're out of the play as well.

36:25.266 --> 36:26.559
Are you serious?

36:26.642 --> 36:29.937
I told you yesterday
that the class begins at 8:00 a.m.

36:30.479 --> 36:33.399
If you can't handle a simple schedule,
I doubt you can handle anything else.

36:33.482 --> 36:34.483
So go.
