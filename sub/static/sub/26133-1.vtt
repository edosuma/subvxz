00:08.943 --> 00:11.143
And now it's time for bed.

00:11.245 --> 00:12.745
Yes, it is.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.546
Oh.

00:14.615 --> 00:17.316
I know.
I know, I know.

00:17.418 --> 00:19.018
It's bedtime though.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.021
'Cause Mommy
knows how early
you like to wake up.

00:23.024 --> 00:24.690
Oh, yes.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.692
Hey.

00:26.794 --> 00:28.027
Goodnighty night.

It's ok. It's ok Sadie.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.222
Ugh, not again...ugh.

01:35.062 --> 01:36.295
For heaven's sake.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.804
You're kidding me.
   Come on!

01:49.376 --> 01:51.677
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh, shh.

01:51.779 --> 01:54.213
Come on.
Come on.

01:54.315 --> 01:55.848
It's okay.

01:56.884 --> 01:59.151
Shh.

02:01.188 --> 02:02.888
Finally.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.656
Shh.

02:04.725 --> 02:09.228

Oh, my God. Sadie.

Oh, my--

02:25.045 --> 02:26.879
Oh, my God.

02:26.981 --> 02:29.615
Sadie?
                        Sadie.

02:31.418 --> 02:33.719
Oh, my God.

02:36.190 --> 02:38.123
Sadie. Sadie.

02:40.127 --> 02:41.793
Sadie!

02:41.896 --> 02:44.863
Oh, my--

02:56.377 --> 02:58.777
That's
            my beautiful girl.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.782
Everything's okay.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.684
Daddy's got you now.

Nice kick, Michael!
        Look out for
        your mother's flowers.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.921
Mr. Penderson?
                I'm Olivia.

04:15.990 --> 04:17.889
I'm here about the job
        as the nanny.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.692
Olivia. Yes. Hello.
It's nice to finally
 meet you in person.

04:20.793 --> 04:23.262
-Please come in. Come in.
    -Thank you.

04:23.330 --> 04:25.397
Oh! Nice house.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.199
Oh!

04:27.268 --> 04:29.368
I love this kitchen.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.937
Oh, thanks.
It's all my wife's doing.

04:32.039 --> 04:34.239
I just left it
the way she liked it.

04:34.308 --> 04:36.908
I'm sorry.
        The way she <i> liked</i> it?

04:38.078 --> 04:40.779
She's no longer with us.
I'm widowed.
                           Oh.

04:40.881 --> 04:43.415
My sympathies.

04:43.484 --> 04:47.986
When I was at the door,
        I swore I heard you
        talking with someone.

04:48.088 --> 04:51.957
I... talk to my wife
like she's still here sometimes.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.959
Helps me
sort through things.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.194
Old habits, as they say.

04:56.263 --> 04:58.630
As long as she doesn't
  speak back.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.599
That would be crazy!

05:00.701 --> 05:02.567
Right. It would.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.202
-Let me show you around.
    -Oh.

05:04.305 --> 05:06.371
Yeah, right this way.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.975
I was with my last employer
   for almost ten years.

05:10.044 --> 05:12.444
I raised them
    more than their parents did.

05:12.546 --> 05:15.414
That is a long time.
You'd just be tending
after Laura now, but--

05:15.482 --> 05:18.650
Oh, and this
is where you'd sleep
on the nights that you stay.

05:18.719 --> 05:21.119
My work keeps me late
sometimes.
              Fine.

05:21.188 --> 05:23.088
All the children will be
sleeping in the same room.

05:23.157 --> 05:27.025
I feel that keeping them close
really helps them to bond.
You know?

05:27.127 --> 05:28.493
And, uh--

05:28.562 --> 05:32.064
And this is my office.
I keep it locked,
just to be safe.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.199
I'll straighten it.
            Not to worry.

05:34.301 --> 05:37.035
That's not necessary.
I'm very particular
about these things.

05:37.104 --> 05:40.772
In my experience,
            men don't see dirt
            as women do.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.575
I'm sure I can make it
        spick-and-span.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.645
As I said,
this room is off-limits.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.714
Understood?

05:49.683 --> 05:51.616
Of course.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.585
Less for me to do then.
Exactly.

05:53.654 --> 05:56.988
As I mentioned on the phone,

05:57.057 --> 05:59.491
I would need for payment
        to be in cash.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.961
I find your government
        just gets in the way
        of these things.

06:03.030 --> 06:06.365
I would prefer that as well.
 It'll be our little secret.

06:06.433 --> 06:09.234
When can you start?
                   Right away.

06:09.336 --> 06:11.303
Good.

07:04.958 --> 07:09.227
God, I'm so stupid.
 Everyone told me not to trust you again.

07:09.329 --> 07:11.229
It's in our past.
            That has nothing--

07:11.331 --> 07:13.799
Yeah, I thought so too.
        But now this.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.467
No, no, I just wanted
 to tell you before
  someone else did.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.736
I bumped into her at a party and
       she came on to me.

07:17.805 --> 07:20.205
Look, I.. I... was...

07:20.307 --> 07:22.874
It was a kiss, Jenn.
            I was drunk.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.777
And that's supposed to
        make me feel better?

07:25.879 --> 07:29.114
-How could you do this
        to our family?
        -I'm sorry.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.552
I want--
            I want you to leave.

07:33.654 --> 07:36.288
-Jenn, let's just talk
        about this. Okay?
        -Talk?

07:36.390 --> 07:38.223
I can't even look at you
        right now.

07:38.325 --> 07:40.592
-Jenn--
        -Get out!

09:40.747 --> 09:41.813
Oh, God.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.520
<i> 911. What's your emergency?</i>

09:48.589 --> 09:50.956
Hello. I need an ambulance.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.725
There was an argument, um--
They w-- They were yelling.

09:53.827 --> 09:56.695
I think something
            might be wrong.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.797
The woman is--
She's pregnant, and she's hurt.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.633
The address is
4262 Navajo Court.

10:02.970 --> 10:06.771
<i> And what's your name, sir?</i>
Please hurry.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.919
All your vitals
are back to normal.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.388
Your placenta and cervix
still look good.

10:23.457 --> 10:25.824
-What about the baby?
    -The baby is fine.

10:25.892 --> 10:28.927
The bleeding was caused
by early cervix dilation.

10:28.996 --> 10:33.331
There can be numerous triggers,
    but in your case I'd say
it was caused by extreme stress.

10:33.433 --> 10:34.866
Gee,
                what a shock.

10:34.935 --> 10:37.168
Karen, can we
let the doctor talk?

10:37.270 --> 10:39.237
Mm-hmm.
You're very lucky.

10:39.306 --> 10:43.241
If the ambulance hadn't arrived
when it did, we wouldn't be
having this conversation.

10:44.578 --> 10:46.444
<i>Dr. Busmus, dial the operator.</i>

10:46.546 --> 10:49.514
Hey, uh, so I gotta
            see my wife Jenn.

10:49.616 --> 10:51.249
Where is she staying?

10:52.853 --> 10:55.186
This is where they told
          me to go. Room 203.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.125
Okay.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.930
You need rest,
    and absolutely no stress.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.133
Hey, Jenn.

11:08.201 --> 11:11.202
Matt, what a surprise.
        We were just
        talking about you.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.171
Are you okay?
The baby?

11:13.240 --> 11:16.007
-He's fine.
        -They both are,
        no thanks to you.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.243
What the hell happened?

11:18.345 --> 11:21.279
Your wife and child
        got very lucky.
        Count your blessings.

11:21.348 --> 11:25.617
We should have you induced.
      It'll be safest
for both you and the baby.

11:25.686 --> 11:28.420
I'll make sure
the nurses have it scheduled
before you're released.

11:28.488 --> 11:31.823
Until then, plenty of rest
and, as I said, no stress.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.825
No stress. Got it.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.660
Thanks, Doc.

11:37.497 --> 11:41.499
I'm sorry, Matt,
   but I think you should go.

11:41.601 --> 11:45.970
Look, if you need anything--
anything at all--

11:46.039 --> 11:48.907
I'll take care of it.
        Don't you worry, Matt.

11:48.975 --> 11:52.977
<i>Dr. Busmus, dial the operator.</i>
<i>Dr. Busmus, dial the operator.</i>

11:53.080 --> 11:57.115
<i>Dr. Scott,</i>
<i>dial the operator, please.</i>
<i>Dr. Scott, dial the operator.</i>

12:12.933 --> 12:14.299
Okay, what's up?

12:14.401 --> 12:15.900
I know that look.

12:16.002 --> 12:18.503
I just keep thinking
about last night.

12:18.605 --> 12:23.942
I mean, I could have sworn
I locked the door
when Matt left.

12:24.044 --> 12:27.445
Yet somehow it was open
for the paramedics to get in.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.848
It was
    a pretty stressful night.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.784
Memories get fuzzy
        during times like that.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.786
Consider yourself lucky
        you didn't lock it.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.889
Otherwise, they would have
   had to bust it open.
   Can you imagine that?

12:37.991 --> 12:41.860
Some burly fireman
            breaking his way in.

12:42.829 --> 12:45.630
Mmm.

12:48.769 --> 12:52.504
Yeah, and also,
I keep wondering,
who called 911?

12:54.207 --> 12:56.541
Your dad probably
      still knows people
      on the force, right?

12:56.643 --> 12:58.576
He hasn't been retired
        that long.

12:58.678 --> 13:02.247
I bet he could
            pull some strings,
              get some intel.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.649
Someone probably
        still owes him a favor.

13:06.987 --> 13:10.155
You... are a genius.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.624
It's really nice
            to hear someone else
            say it.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.955
When is the baby
            coming home?

13:44.057 --> 13:46.524
Soon, honey.
It's just not time yet.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.493
But I want a baby
            to play with.

13:48.562 --> 13:52.430
I know you do.
But what did I tell you
about waiting for things?

13:52.499 --> 13:54.399
You have to be patient.

13:54.467 --> 13:57.502
Right. Because
the best things in life--

13:57.571 --> 13:59.270
Are worth waiting for.

13:59.372 --> 14:00.972
Exactly.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.941
She'll be her before you know
             it.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.009
Daddy's going to pick her up in
          a few days,

14:05.078 --> 14:06.911
and then we'll all be together.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.479
The way it was ment to be.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.916
Is that where
        our sister is staying?

14:12.018 --> 14:13.151
It sure is.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.142
You have a guest.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.144
A guest?
                    Uh, a woman.

14:40.213 --> 14:43.414
I asked her to leave,
        but she's quite adamant.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.683
Were you on the phone?
        I heard you talking.

14:45.752 --> 14:47.886
Of course
I was on the phone.

14:59.366 --> 15:02.066
Hi. I'm Jennifer.

15:02.168 --> 15:03.201
Uh, hi.

15:03.303 --> 15:05.403
Um, I'm really sorry
            to bother you,

15:05.472 --> 15:09.574
but you were the one
    that called the ambulance
    last night, right?

15:09.676 --> 15:11.609
Um, I don't, uh--

15:11.678 --> 15:14.879
I know some people
    in law enforcement,
    and they tracked you down

15:14.948 --> 15:17.315
using your cell phone
        or something.

15:17.384 --> 15:21.085
Yeah, I mean, I just--
    I respect that you didn't
    want to leave your name,

15:21.187 --> 15:22.887
and I completely
                understand,

15:22.956 --> 15:25.823
but I had to come find you
   and say thank you
   for saving my life

15:25.892 --> 15:28.526
and the life of my son.

15:29.663 --> 15:32.096
-It's a boy.
        -Yeah.

15:32.198 --> 15:33.965
Please come in.
    I'm so sorry.
                   Oh! Yeah!

15:34.067 --> 15:36.668
How rude of me.
               No, no.

15:38.672 --> 15:40.939
Yeah, it's a boy.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.373
His name's Connor.

15:42.442 --> 15:45.443
Or it will be
when he gets here.

15:45.545 --> 15:50.214
And that's all thanks to you.
It was such a blessing
to have you there.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.216
Well, I was just--

15:52.319 --> 15:55.019
I-- I'm thinking about
    moving in across the street,

15:55.088 --> 15:57.288
get closer to the city
         and prep for schools.

15:57.357 --> 16:00.425
I like to check out
the neighborhood at all hours,
make sure there's no surprises.

16:00.493 --> 16:03.027
The last thing you want
    is some kid practicing drums
    in his garage

16:03.129 --> 16:04.996
while I've got kids
            to get to sleep.

16:05.098 --> 16:07.598
Oh. Yeah, sure.
I mean, that's really smart.

16:09.169 --> 16:12.837
Look, I heard the argument
   when I first got there.

16:12.939 --> 16:14.839
It sounded bad.

16:14.908 --> 16:17.775
So later, when I was leaving,
I just decided to check on you,

16:17.844 --> 16:20.611
and that's when I saw you
    on the floor,
    through the window.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.014
Thank God you did.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.983
It was like
you were meant to be there.

16:25.085 --> 16:26.751
Oh--

16:26.853 --> 16:28.720
Saying "thank you"
will never be enough.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.555
So will you at least
let me take you out to lunch?

16:30.657 --> 16:32.490
Oh, no.
        That's not necessary.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.325
Oh, it is <i> so</i> necessary.

16:34.394 --> 16:39.297
Besides, you wouldn't
deny a pregnant woman
a meal, would you?

16:42.102 --> 16:43.301
I love it.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.969
That's great.
           Thanks.

16:45.071 --> 16:47.705
So, is this
            our mystery man?
                   Yep.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.107
In the flesh.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.708
I approve.

16:52.879 --> 16:56.247
Thank you
     for saving the life
     of my business partner.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.749
You're welcome.

16:57.851 --> 17:00.852
All right.
        Give me a minute.

17:00.954 --> 17:02.954
Take your time.

17:03.056 --> 17:05.289
So, when are you
               moving into
            the neighborhood?

17:05.358 --> 17:08.291
Uh, I'm not--
Uh-- Uh, I mean--

17:09.429 --> 17:11.162
I don't know. I guess
I hadn't decided yet.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.330
I was still considering it.
                       Oh.

17:13.400 --> 17:17.234
Well, it would be great
        to have someone
        like you around,

17:17.337 --> 17:19.069
watching over us.

17:21.407 --> 17:23.808
Why didn't you
                leave your name
                with 911?

17:25.145 --> 17:27.111
I didn't want
any recognition.

17:29.916 --> 17:32.483
I lost my wife
last year,

17:32.585 --> 17:36.754
so when I saw you lying
on the floor, I just couldn't
let that happen to anybody else.

17:36.823 --> 17:38.990
Nobody
should have to experience
that kind of pain.

17:39.092 --> 17:41.025
Oh, my God, I'm--

17:42.529 --> 17:44.562
That is awful.

17:44.631 --> 17:48.399
Two of our children
were taken with her.
It was a car accident.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.003
I am so sorry.

17:53.006 --> 17:56.541
I-- I can't imagine
            that kind of loss.

17:56.609 --> 17:59.377
I-I think
        I would lose my mind.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.414
Yeah.

18:03.516 --> 18:06.517
Your world shatters,
and it tries
to shatter you with it.

18:06.619 --> 18:09.487
Mentally, physically.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.456
But then I thought about
my other children

18:11.524 --> 18:14.225
and how they needed me now
more than ever,

18:14.327 --> 18:16.861
needed me to keep them safe.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.863
I'm the only one who can.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.799
So you have
                other children.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.601
Two girls.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.570
Wow.
    At your age?

18:25.672 --> 18:28.206
Yeah.
      I got married young.
      I was 22.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.241
We wanted a big family,
so...

18:31.878 --> 18:33.744
That's a lot of work.

18:33.813 --> 18:36.147
Oh, I'm just taking care
of my oldest now.

18:36.249 --> 18:39.350
My other daughter is with family
 while I get things sorted here.

18:40.854 --> 18:41.986
What are their names?

18:43.990 --> 18:46.657
Laura and Mandy.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.192
Oh.

18:49.562 --> 18:52.396
Honestly, I can't imagine
    what you've been through,

18:52.499 --> 18:55.900
but they are so lucky
    to have such a great dad

18:56.002 --> 18:58.302
watching over them,
            protecting them.

18:58.404 --> 19:01.038
And when you move
        into the neighborhood,

19:03.042 --> 19:06.744
I would be happy
        to watch them anytime,
        if you need me to.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.847
It's the least I can do
        for my guardian angel.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.849
That's sweet. Thank you.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.751
Of course.

19:14.954 --> 19:17.155
Time for your nap.

19:17.223 --> 19:19.090
Being a baby
is quite tiring.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.561
Look! There's Mummy.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.831
Let's find pictures
            of the two of you.

19:26.900 --> 19:30.468
Certainly
        there are photos of you
              somewhere.

19:33.006 --> 19:35.173
Oh.
There's my sweet girl.

19:35.275 --> 19:38.776
- You ready for your nap?

19:38.878 --> 19:41.946
-How was your lunch?
    -It was very nice.

19:43.116 --> 19:46.784
Can I ask-- This woman,
you saved her life?

19:46.886 --> 19:48.619
Oh, it was nothing.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.888
Just happened
   to be at the right place
   at the right time, I guess.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.690
-And she wanted to thank me.
    -Oh.

19:52.759 --> 19:57.061
-You mentioned moving
to her neighborhood.
-Yes. We should start packing.

19:58.364 --> 20:01.532
Yesterday I was asked
to prepare for a new child,

20:01.634 --> 20:03.534
and now we're moving?

20:03.603 --> 20:07.104
The change of scenery
   will be good for everyone,
   especially the children.

20:07.173 --> 20:12.577
Giving them a place to settle
and stability is usually best.

20:12.645 --> 20:15.980
I don't pay you
    for your opinion.
    I pay you to do your job.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.815
But your other child--

20:17.884 --> 20:19.951
Olivia, I thought
        we had an understanding.

20:21.454 --> 20:25.289
You don't ask me
    about my situation,
    and I don't ask about yours.

20:25.358 --> 20:28.793
Because I'm sure yours
        would lead to
        much more trouble.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.497
Now, let's honor
                that agreement

20:33.600 --> 20:36.567
and go back to being
        the happy little family
        that we are.

20:41.441 --> 20:44.976
Mr. Penderson,
   I'd like to prepare for
   the other baby's arrival--

20:45.044 --> 20:47.612
put up some photos
             of her and Laura.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.480
But I couldn't find any.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.384
They're packed away.
I'll have to dig them up.

21:02.996 --> 21:04.862
I can't open
any of these drawers.

21:04.964 --> 21:07.465
That's because
    they're baby-locked, Dad,

21:07.533 --> 21:10.067
so that they can't get at
    anything dangerous.

21:10.169 --> 21:12.570
We didn't have
anything like that
when you were born.

21:12.639 --> 21:16.140
You turned out just fine.
You even played
with kitchen knives.

21:17.010 --> 21:18.509
Well, times have changed.

21:25.051 --> 21:26.917
Wow.

21:26.986 --> 21:29.220
What's that?
Another apology gift
from Matt?

21:29.289 --> 21:31.889
Uh, no.
    It's from Garrett.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.625
This is
        top-of-the-line stuff.

21:34.694 --> 21:36.594
You can watch this
       on your phone.

21:36.663 --> 21:39.330
I guess
he wants you to be safe.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.933
It's not for me.
        It's for the baby, Dad.

21:43.036 --> 21:46.003
Still, it's a good way
to keep your eye on things.

21:56.282 --> 21:58.916
What are you
        keeping in here?

22:39.592 --> 22:41.826
Oh, my.

22:41.928 --> 22:45.329
Where are you hiding
            all this money?

22:53.139 --> 22:54.672
"Jennifer."

23:16.729 --> 23:19.263
Come on, come on.

23:27.740 --> 23:31.442
Oh! You're back sooner
        than expected.

23:31.511 --> 23:32.610
Yep.
How's Laura doing?

23:32.712 --> 23:35.713
Perfect.
            She's been napping
            since you left.

23:35.782 --> 23:38.549
Oh, that's great.
Thank you, Olivia.

23:57.403 --> 23:59.670
Olivia.

23:59.739 --> 24:03.841
When I hired you,
I did so because I needed
somebody that I could trust.

24:05.511 --> 24:09.814
Trust to take care
of my Laura
and to obey my rules.

24:09.882 --> 24:11.115
Of course,
                Mr. Penderson.

24:11.217 --> 24:14.351
One of those rules
was that my office is private.

24:14.454 --> 24:16.854
No one was to go in
except me.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.289
Yes, of course.

24:18.391 --> 24:20.458
Then why did you
break that rule?

24:20.560 --> 24:23.694
I-I'm-- I'm sorry.
        I-I-I don't understand.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.329
You see,
that was a lie.

24:25.431 --> 24:27.498
What did you see
in my office?

24:27.600 --> 24:29.467
Oh, I don't know
        what you're on about--

24:29.569 --> 24:31.602
What did you see?
     Nothing.

24:31.704 --> 24:33.871
I-I-I didn't see
                anything.

24:33.940 --> 24:36.874
See, I would love
to believe you.
I really would.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.676
But I can't.

24:39.512 --> 24:42.213
So I will ask you again.

24:42.315 --> 24:44.515
What did you see
in my office?

24:44.584 --> 24:47.451
There were--
  The children's things.

24:47.553 --> 24:49.420
I-In boxes.

24:49.522 --> 24:53.357
A-A-A map
                    on the wall.
                    Papers.

24:53.459 --> 24:54.925
Thank you
for your honesty.

24:56.395 --> 24:57.795
I'm sorry,
            Mr. Penderson.

24:57.864 --> 25:01.098
Olivia, you're fired.
Get out.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.535
At least let me
        say good-bye to Laura.

25:04.637 --> 25:06.537
No.

25:06.606 --> 25:08.973
Gather your things
and leave.

25:10.009 --> 25:11.876
And if you even think

25:11.978 --> 25:13.844
about
making any trouble about this,

25:13.913 --> 25:15.813
my first call
will be to Immigration.

25:15.882 --> 25:18.916
And I have a hunch that
they will throw you in jail,

25:19.018 --> 25:22.520
and then
they're gonna put you on a boat
back to merry old England.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.555
Am I right?

25:26.425 --> 25:28.626
Good-bye, Mr. Penderson.

25:39.605 --> 25:41.805
You didn't need
                to come down.
                I'll get it.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.908
I can get the door, Dad.
               So can I!

25:44.010 --> 25:45.609
Will you go sit?
 No.

25:45.678 --> 25:47.378
Next time
               let me get it.
            Sure.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.313
Hi, Garrett.

25:49.415 --> 25:51.181
Hi.
Is this a good time?

25:51.250 --> 25:55.052
Please come in. This is my dad.
He's staying with me for a while
to help out.

25:55.154 --> 25:57.087
Hi. I'm John.

25:57.156 --> 25:59.990
You must be the guardian angel
I've heard so much about.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

26:00.059 --> 26:03.761
-I can't thank you enough
for what you did back there.
-Well--

26:03.829 --> 26:06.864
-It's like you were
   meant to be there.
   -It was just luck, I guess.

26:06.933 --> 26:09.366
But I understand.
I'm a father too.

26:09.435 --> 26:12.937
Come in. Please.
       Can I get you anything?
No, I'm all set.

26:13.005 --> 26:17.408
I just wanted to come by
and let you know that
we are officially neighbors.

26:17.510 --> 26:20.377
-I just signed the lease.
-Oh, that's great!

26:20.446 --> 26:22.580
-Welcome to the neighborhood.
-Thank you.

26:22.682 --> 26:24.081
Yeah, the house is great.

26:24.150 --> 26:26.050
It's got plenty of room
for the kids

26:26.118 --> 26:29.620
and a private office
in the attic so I
can get some work done.

26:29.722 --> 26:30.854
And how are you feeling?

26:30.923 --> 26:34.258
Uh, like a basketball
that's ready to pop.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.393
Well, you should be sitting.

26:36.462 --> 26:38.195
This is what
            I've been saying.

26:38.264 --> 26:40.998
She doesn't listen to me.
   She gets that from her mom.

26:42.335 --> 26:43.968
Oh, that's the oven.

26:44.036 --> 26:46.704
Jenn has me playing
    both chef and cleaning lady.

26:46.806 --> 26:49.306
I'll be right back.
No, I should
get going anyway.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.408
A lot of packing to do.
Just came to share
the good news.

26:51.477 --> 26:56.580
And once I'm settled,
I can come by and help finish
setting up the baby's room.

26:58.050 --> 27:00.184
H-How did you know
    the nursery wasn't finished?

27:02.321 --> 27:04.088
I guessed.

27:04.156 --> 27:07.157
It's not like you've had
much time anyways, after
everything that's happened.

27:07.259 --> 27:11.729
I just remember our first kid.
We were scrambled
up until the very last second.

27:13.332 --> 27:15.833
Matt.

27:15.935 --> 27:18.469
Um, this is Garrett.

27:18.537 --> 27:20.771
He's the one
    that called the ambulance
    the other night.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.941
Oh. Is that so?
         Uh, thank you.

27:24.010 --> 27:26.477
It was nothing.
I'm just glad they're okay.

27:26.545 --> 27:32.549
I should probably also thank you
for, uh, all the hours I spent
being questioned by the cops.

27:32.652 --> 27:34.351
Oh, my God.
            Seriously, Matt?

27:34.453 --> 27:37.054
How about next time
don't file a report
until you know all the facts.

27:37.123 --> 27:39.623
Look, I heard an argument--
a heated one--

27:39.725 --> 27:42.860
and then I saw a woman
lying on the floor, bleeding.

27:42.962 --> 27:45.195
I think you'd do the same,
Matt.

27:45.264 --> 27:48.432
One last question.
What, exactly, were you doing
looking into our window?

27:48.534 --> 27:50.234
Oh, for God's sakes, Matt.

27:50.302 --> 27:54.405
We're lucky he was there.
    If he hadn't,
    I could be dead.

27:56.242 --> 27:58.008
Did you need
                something?

28:00.012 --> 28:02.546
-I just came
    to check in on you.
    -I'm fine.

28:02.615 --> 28:05.816
I'm following
   the doctor's orders
   and keeping my stress down,

28:05.918 --> 28:08.318
and that's how
      I'd like it to stay.

28:08.387 --> 28:11.221
Maybe you wanna go
grab some dinner and just talk?

28:11.323 --> 28:13.357
It's already
                taken care of.

28:13.426 --> 28:15.659
She's fine, Matt.
        I'm making sure of that.

28:15.728 --> 28:18.395
I'm just gonna go.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.532
Thanks again.

28:21.634 --> 28:23.400
It was my pleasure.

28:36.649 --> 28:40.317
-All set.
       -It looks great.
       Thank you so much.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.286
-I could've done that.
        -Yeah.

28:42.354 --> 28:45.055
And then I would've
            heard you complain
            about it for days.

28:49.428 --> 28:51.495
My back's
        not what it used to be.

28:51.564 --> 28:53.797
She worries about me,
    but I'm built tough.

28:53.866 --> 28:55.599
That's fine.
I don't mind helping.

28:55.668 --> 28:58.869
Here, let me take that.
    It's the least I can do.

29:02.208 --> 29:03.974
Oh. One last touch.

29:20.392 --> 29:21.759
Now we're talkin'.

29:21.861 --> 29:23.594
If there's any way
        I can return the favor--

29:23.696 --> 29:26.029
Actually, there is.

29:26.132 --> 29:30.134
I'm heading to pick up
Laura's sister,
and my new nanny bailed on me.

29:30.202 --> 29:32.102
Would you mind
      watching her for me?

29:32.171 --> 29:34.371
Oh, I would love to.
            Yes, please!

29:34.473 --> 29:37.508
Really?
It's not too much to ask?
                           No.

29:37.576 --> 29:39.843
And it'll be
                great practice
                 for this guy.

29:39.945 --> 29:41.278
Thank you.

29:41.347 --> 29:44.381
It'll be so nice
to have both my daughters back.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.317
Well, thank you again,
and I'm glad
I could help today.

29:47.419 --> 29:49.052
So, I'll see ya.
                       Okay.

29:50.523 --> 29:52.289
Bye.
                       Bye.

30:58.824 --> 31:00.524
No, that won't do.

31:24.416 --> 31:27.751
Jenn. Hey, it's Garrett.
        I'm just calling to see
        how Laura's doing.

31:27.820 --> 31:32.356
Hi. She's great.
Although I'm not sure
my dad's gonna give her up.

31:32.458 --> 31:34.725
<i>How's your trip?</i>
                   Easy.

31:36.362 --> 31:38.295
None of that awful traffic?

31:38.364 --> 31:40.731
No problems at all.

31:40.833 --> 31:42.733
<i>Oh, good.</i>
<i>And how's Mandy?</i>

31:42.835 --> 31:44.368
She's beautiful.

31:44.436 --> 31:46.670
<i>Of course she is.</i>
<i>You already knew that.</i>

31:46.772 --> 31:48.906
Right.
        It's just, I-- It's--

31:49.008 --> 31:50.607
I just haven't seen her
        in so long,

31:50.709 --> 31:53.343
it feels like
            I'm seeing her again
            for the first time.

31:53.412 --> 31:57.281
Yeah, I can't imagine
what it must have been like
to be away from her for so long.

31:57.349 --> 32:01.585
It'll be nice to have her
    all to myself,
    have my family back.

32:01.687 --> 32:03.487
Yeah.

32:03.589 --> 32:05.555
Yeah, I bet.

32:07.826 --> 32:09.726
Hey, Garrett,
            can I call you back?

32:09.795 --> 32:11.695
Okay.
            Kiss Laura for me.

32:11.797 --> 32:13.096
Will do.

32:13.933 --> 32:16.433
Look what the cat dragged in.

32:16.535 --> 32:18.402
-Hey, John.
        -Hello.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.037
What do you want,
            Matt?

32:20.139 --> 32:21.571
Can we talk?

32:32.584 --> 32:35.652
I get it.
I screwed up. Okay?

32:35.754 --> 32:37.654
I wanna make things right.

32:37.723 --> 32:40.590
I wanna be around more.
I wanna fix the baby's room.
   I wanna make the crib.

32:40.659 --> 32:41.992
There's no need to.

32:42.094 --> 32:44.995
Stuff has to get done.
           It's already done.

32:46.365 --> 32:50.167
You should've let me know.
Your dad's back's
already bad enough.

32:50.269 --> 32:52.069
Actually,
                Garrett did it.

32:54.440 --> 32:57.274
You let him build
our baby's crib?

32:57.343 --> 33:01.244
Well, he offered,
and you weren't around,
and you weren't gonna be around.

33:01.313 --> 33:03.814
What's next?
He's gonna sleep
in the guest room?

33:03.916 --> 33:05.782
Or is he already
in the bed?

33:05.884 --> 33:09.686
Oh, please.
        You are in no position
        to tell me what to do.

33:09.755 --> 33:14.458
You hardly know the guy.
It's been, what, two weeks,
and he's around all the time.

33:14.526 --> 33:16.560
Because he's concerned
       about the baby.
Or maybe he's interested in you.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.695
Oh, really?

33:18.797 --> 33:22.632
I am, like,
        a thousand pounds
        and about ready to pop.

33:22.701 --> 33:24.735
Nobody
        finds this attractive.

33:24.837 --> 33:26.570
I do.

33:26.638 --> 33:28.405
Okay, well,
            in Garrett's case,

33:28.474 --> 33:30.340
I can assure you
                it's not me.

33:30.409 --> 33:32.442
And that makes it
even weirder.

33:32.511 --> 33:36.646
Or maybe it's the fact
    that he lost two children
    in an accident.

33:38.650 --> 33:41.184
Okay. I didn't know that.

33:41.253 --> 33:44.087
I know.
        'Cause you didn't ask.

33:44.189 --> 33:46.056
And he was also
                here for me.

33:46.158 --> 33:48.825
I mean, he basically
            saved my baby.

33:48.927 --> 33:50.394
Our baby, Jenn.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.231
I get it. Okay?

33:54.333 --> 33:56.400
I screwed up.

33:56.468 --> 33:59.703
It was a stupid kiss, a mistake,
and I'm sorry about that.
You have to let me--

33:59.772 --> 34:02.172
It's not just that.
            I can't rely on you.

34:02.274 --> 34:03.774
That's not true.
                       It is.

34:03.876 --> 34:05.409
You weren't there
            that night.

34:05.511 --> 34:07.077
You haven't been there
        in the past.

34:07.146 --> 34:09.545
Whenever I need you,
             you are not around.

34:11.917 --> 34:13.949
I'm-- No.
            I'm done talking.

34:14.018 --> 34:15.619
Come on, Jenn.

34:42.748 --> 34:44.681
Okay, Garrett Penderson.

34:46.085 --> 34:48.051
Let's see who you are.

34:57.329 --> 35:00.263
]

35:27.159 --> 35:28.325
Hi.

35:40.139 --> 35:42.205
It's okay. Mommy's coming.

35:47.379 --> 35:49.446
It's okay. Mommy's coming.

35:50.516 --> 35:53.049
Hey. Hey.

35:53.886 --> 35:56.620
It's okay. It's okay.

35:56.722 --> 36:00.223
Did you have a bad dream?
Yeah?

36:00.325 --> 36:03.426
It's okay. Shh.

36:03.529 --> 36:08.198
Oh, it's so late.
You need to go back to bed.

36:10.269 --> 36:12.169
You wanna sleep
with Mommy tonight?

36:12.237 --> 36:14.604
Daddy'll be home,
and he can put you back to bed.

36:14.706 --> 36:16.406
Okay? Okay.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.942
Now... where's Mr. Snuggles?

36:20.445 --> 36:24.281
Hmm? Did you drop him?
    Did you drop him?

36:24.349 --> 36:27.050
Where's... Snuggles?

36:27.152 --> 36:29.619
He's gotta be around here
    somewhere.

36:30.923 --> 36:32.455
Oh.

36:32.558 --> 36:35.458
There. There he is.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.394
There he is!

36:37.462 --> 36:39.663
Okay,
        let's go back to bed.

36:39.765 --> 36:42.165
Okay? Yeah.

36:42.267 --> 36:44.701
Yeah.
    You're so good.

37:07.492 --> 37:10.961
Tom? Is that you?

37:11.063 --> 37:13.263
Can you put the baby
      back in her crib?

37:37.122 --> 37:39.356
Wait! Stop!
What are you doing?

37:39.424 --> 37:42.993
Please... just put her down
and don't hurt her.

37:51.069 --> 37:53.370
I would <i> never</i> hurt her.

37:53.472 --> 37:54.971
I'm protecting her.

37:56.642 --> 38:01.611
Just leave-- leave my house now.
Her father will be home
at any minute.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.780
Her father's already home.

38:04.516 --> 38:05.882
What?

38:05.984 --> 38:07.517
It didn't
            have to be this way.

38:07.586 --> 38:10.453
No. No, you can leave.
You can still leave.

38:10.522 --> 38:13.056
You can leave.
Just leave now.

38:13.158 --> 38:15.292
I'm sorry.

38:17.296 --> 38:19.829
-You've already seen my face.
-Please! Please!

38:25.137 --> 38:26.569
Yeah!

38:29.041 --> 38:31.641
<i> ...are still fighting</i>
<i>to extinguish a house fire</i>

38:31.743 --> 38:34.244
<i>that claimed the life</i>

38:34.313 --> 38:36.813

38:40.552 --> 38:42.419
I agree.
    That is a little depressing.

38:42.521 --> 38:44.054
Let's try something--

38:44.122 --> 38:47.824

39:05.444 --> 39:07.477
Oh, she's beautiful.

39:07.546 --> 39:09.479
Thanks.

39:10.349 --> 39:11.915
She has your eyes.

39:12.017 --> 39:13.583
They both do,
                really.

39:13.652 --> 39:17.120
-Luck of the draw, I guess.
-Yeah. It shows you're family.

39:17.222 --> 39:18.922
Another little munchkin.

39:18.990 --> 39:22.592
-You had a good trip?
No problems?
-Yeah, nothing to talk about.

39:25.263 --> 39:26.830
Oh, yeah.

39:28.533 --> 39:31.401
Everything go okay?
Laura was a good girl?

39:31.470 --> 39:35.004
Yeah.
   She's a little fussy today,
   but we loved having her.

39:35.073 --> 39:37.340
And it's great
        because they keep
        the same nap schedule.

39:39.845 --> 39:43.513
And this is the thanks I get
       after I agreed
 to go to Lamaze class, huh?

39:43.615 --> 39:46.449
Well, Karen was supposed
        to go with me, but she
        has to work a double,

39:46.551 --> 39:48.351
so Dad volunteered.

39:48.420 --> 39:51.554
I don't know if "volunteer"
is the word I would have used.

39:51.623 --> 39:53.690
-Well, I'll go.
         -Oh!

39:53.759 --> 39:57.293
No, that's okay.
    I mean, that's really sweet,
    but we got it.

39:57.362 --> 40:01.064
No, seriously. I don't mind.
I mean, I've done it before.
Several times.

40:01.133 --> 40:03.366
And I'm sure the last thing
your dad wants to do

40:03.435 --> 40:07.437
is go sit on a hard floor
     for over an hour
doing breathing exercises.

40:07.539 --> 40:10.740
Well... I know
        you don't want to go.

40:10.842 --> 40:12.375
What gave you that idea?

40:12.477 --> 40:14.144
Are you sure?

40:14.246 --> 40:15.979
Yeah. Absolutely.

40:16.081 --> 40:19.215
Oh. My knees and my back
thank you.

40:21.820 --> 40:24.854
Oh, let's get a picture.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.623
We should get a picture
        of you guys.

40:26.691 --> 40:29.659
In a minute.
I want to get one
with all the kids first.

40:32.764 --> 40:34.197
Aw! Smile, honey.

40:34.299 --> 40:36.599
Say hello!
Say hi!

40:36.701 --> 40:38.835
Perfect.

40:43.141 --> 40:46.643
Okay. Garrett Penderson...

40:46.711 --> 40:49.012
tragedy.

40:49.848 --> 40:51.347
Let's try one more.

40:51.450 --> 40:53.483
Garrett Penderson...

40:53.585 --> 40:56.252
family tragedy.

40:58.657 --> 40:59.556
Okay.

40:59.658 --> 41:01.024
Um...

41:01.092 --> 41:03.026
No Garrett Penderson.

41:07.332 --> 41:08.765
He lied.

41:11.603 --> 41:14.003
I really appreciate
you coming with me.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.472
Of course.
        I'm happy to.

41:17.476 --> 41:21.010
-Matt, wha--
     -What is he doing here?

41:21.079 --> 41:24.147
He volunteered to be
my partner for the class.
What are <i> you</i> doing here?

41:24.216 --> 41:27.917
This is our class.
We've been doing it for weeks.
I'm not gonna stop now.

41:28.019 --> 41:31.821
Look, you just go home.
I'll make sure she's okay. Okay?

41:31.923 --> 41:34.023
I don't need you here, Matt.

41:35.026 --> 41:36.392
Can I please talk
            to you alone?

41:36.461 --> 41:39.429
No. Just say
whatever you need to say.

41:41.733 --> 41:43.633
Your little friend
            over here?

41:43.702 --> 41:45.602
I did a little research,
        and there is no record

41:45.670 --> 41:47.770
of Garrett Penderson
            losing his family.

41:49.608 --> 41:50.840
What?
                       Yeah.

41:50.909 --> 41:53.042
In fact,
            there is no records
            of him at all.

41:54.346 --> 41:55.512
Why is that,
                    Garrett?

41:58.116 --> 42:01.150
Well, he's right.

42:01.253 --> 42:04.153
There's no specific mention
of my family's tragedy

42:04.222 --> 42:07.690
because I asked the authorities
to keep our names
out of the press.

42:07.792 --> 42:10.326
For my children
                who survived.

42:10.428 --> 42:11.861
I didn't want them
   being treated differently,

42:11.963 --> 42:15.298
stigmatized for something
that they had no control over.

42:15.367 --> 42:19.536
So if protecting my family
        makes me a liar,
    then I'm happy to be one.

42:19.638 --> 42:23.006
And maybe I don't keep
a large social media profile
because I don't need to.

42:24.342 --> 42:26.543
Maybe I'm not seeking
attention from others,

42:26.645 --> 42:28.244
particularly
                    other women.

42:28.313 --> 42:31.147
-Do not try
   to turn this around on me.
   -You got your answer, Matt.

42:31.216 --> 42:32.615
Jenn, are you serious?

42:32.684 --> 42:33.850
Good-bye.

42:36.421 --> 42:39.088
Okay. You guys--
        You guys go have fun.
        Okay?

42:45.630 --> 42:47.897
[woHey, I'm really sorry
   about the whole Matt thing.

42:47.999 --> 42:49.198
No, that's fine.

42:49.301 --> 42:52.168
Actually, I was thinking
I'd like to have him over.

42:52.237 --> 42:54.103
Just the two of us,
man-to-man,

42:54.205 --> 42:56.105
and work things out.

42:56.174 --> 42:58.274
Are you sure
            that's a good idea?

42:58.343 --> 43:01.377
Yeah. This whole thing is just
 a big misunderstanding anyways.

43:01.446 --> 43:04.480
I can just explain things
over food and a beer.

43:04.583 --> 43:06.015
Maybe two beers.

43:07.852 --> 43:11.020
All I'm saying is
I don't think there needs
to be any bad blood between us.

43:11.089 --> 43:14.924
I mean,
        that is really sweet,
        but you don't have to.

43:15.026 --> 43:16.292
No, I want to.

43:16.361 --> 43:19.095
I think it'll make
life easier on all of us.

43:21.066 --> 43:24.601
Okay. I mean,
        if you think it'll help.

43:24.703 --> 43:26.002
No, it'll be great.

43:44.656 --> 43:47.190
I don't know
                     about this.

43:51.262 --> 43:54.530
Oh, Garrett's a big boy.
He can take care of himself.

43:54.633 --> 43:57.000
Hey. Thanks for coming.

43:59.104 --> 44:01.337
Come on. Let's eat.

44:05.010 --> 44:06.576
Hey, I'm glad
you agreed to come.

44:06.678 --> 44:09.979
I left the kids with Jenn
    so that we could talk
    uninterrupted.

44:10.081 --> 44:13.416
Look,
        I just think we got off
        on the wrong foot.

44:13.518 --> 44:16.052
There's no need
        for tension between us.

44:16.121 --> 44:18.054
And besides,
        if we can make amends,

44:18.123 --> 44:21.024
I'd be happy
        to put in a good word
        with Jenn for you.

44:21.993 --> 44:22.825
Beer?

44:28.900 --> 44:30.967
To new beginnings.

44:31.036 --> 44:33.736
You know, let me first
        just apologize.

44:33.838 --> 44:36.272
Look, I had no idea
that they were gonna
charge you that night

44:36.341 --> 44:37.874
when I called the police.

44:37.976 --> 44:40.476
It didn't even occur to me.
           That's not exactly
           what they said.

44:40.545 --> 44:42.412
They said you saw me
            assault my wife.

44:42.480 --> 44:46.115
I don't even remember
    what I said.
I was just reacting.

44:48.253 --> 44:50.620
You know
I lost my wife, right?

44:50.722 --> 44:51.988
And my kids too.

44:52.090 --> 44:55.391
So when I saw Jenn
laying there,

44:55.493 --> 44:57.994
bleeding and helpless,

44:58.096 --> 44:59.762
it just set me off.

45:00.899 --> 45:02.131
Look, between us,

45:02.200 --> 45:04.567
I have no romantic feelings
for Jenn.

45:04.669 --> 45:06.069
She's lovely,

45:06.137 --> 45:07.870
but she's already
part of a family.

45:07.939 --> 45:10.640
I would never get
in the way of that.

45:10.742 --> 45:12.909
Family is <i> the</i> most
important thing to me.

45:12.977 --> 45:15.111
See, I'm-- I'm--
                I'm really glad
                you said that.

45:17.082 --> 45:20.316
Man, I just don't like you
   hanging out with my wife
   all the time.

45:20.385 --> 45:21.918
I'm sure if the roles
        were switched,

45:21.986 --> 45:24.187
you would probably feel
        the same exact way.

45:24.289 --> 45:25.722
Absolutely.

45:27.726 --> 45:28.691
Hey.

45:29.861 --> 45:32.562
Thank you
                for helping her,
                by the way.

45:32.664 --> 45:34.530
Yeah, you <i> should</i> be
thankful.

45:34.632 --> 45:37.200
I saved the life
of your wife and son.

45:37.302 --> 45:38.334
Oh.

45:38.403 --> 45:41.637
He's not actually
your son, is he?

45:42.640 --> 45:44.707
Boy, that must eat at you,

45:44.776 --> 45:47.477
knowing that you
can't give Jenn, or any woman,

45:47.545 --> 45:51.280
what she really wants--
to be a mom.

45:56.254 --> 45:58.287
Thanks for the beer,
            psycho.

45:58.389 --> 46:00.656
Oh, I really wish you
        hadn't have done that.

46:00.725 --> 46:02.892
You really wish
I hadn't done what?

46:02.961 --> 46:05.361
Garrett, what are you doing?
Stop! Stop it!

46:05.463 --> 46:07.497
Please help me!
        Somebody! Please stop!

46:07.599 --> 46:09.799
- Garrett!
-    Oh, my God! Help me!

46:09.868 --> 46:12.101
-Somebody help me!
        Help! Help me, please!
        -Garrett!

46:13.772 --> 46:15.838
This is-- This is crazy.
                        Help me!

46:15.940 --> 46:17.440
I'm in here! Help!

46:17.542 --> 46:19.208
I've been attacked! Help me!

46:20.845 --> 46:21.878
Help!

46:21.980 --> 46:24.046
Help me!

46:24.149 --> 46:25.615
-What the--
            -I'm in here! Help!

46:25.717 --> 46:28.017
Dad!

46:30.622 --> 46:32.455
- I've been attacked!
-    Help me!

46:42.600 --> 46:44.367
Garrett?

46:45.904 --> 46:49.572
Hey-- Hey, Garrett.
    It's Jennifer and J--

46:49.674 --> 46:51.207
Oh, my God. Dad.
    Oh.

46:51.309 --> 46:53.009
Garrett.
Garrett.

46:53.111 --> 46:54.143
Hey.

46:54.245 --> 46:55.144
Hey.

46:55.246 --> 46:56.312
Hey.

46:56.414 --> 46:58.114
I'm gonna call this in.
              Okay.

46:58.216 --> 46:59.715
Hi.

46:59.818 --> 47:01.818
I'm sorry.
                What happened?

47:01.920 --> 47:04.453
I guess it
            didn't go too well.

47:15.066 --> 47:16.833
Oh, Jenn, thank God.

47:18.503 --> 47:20.703
I can't believe this.

47:20.805 --> 47:22.672
I mean, I knew
            you had a temper.

47:22.740 --> 47:24.307
But this?

47:24.409 --> 47:26.609
I-- I didn't touch him
at all, Jenn, I swear.

47:26.678 --> 47:28.578
You were the only one
        over there.

47:28.646 --> 47:30.379
I saw you.
   He has cuts and contusions.

47:30.448 --> 47:34.650
He was doing it to himself.
He went nuts, Jenn.

47:34.719 --> 47:36.819
He started grabbing things
and slamming it over his head.

47:36.921 --> 47:39.589
And then he started yelling
like I was attacking him.

47:40.825 --> 47:43.159
I-- Is that
            the best you can do?

47:43.228 --> 47:45.294
He set me up.

47:45.363 --> 47:47.463
This whole thing
is a plan, Jenn.

47:47.532 --> 47:50.533
Why?
      Why would he do that?
I don't know.

47:50.602 --> 47:52.869
I mean, to get to you,
to get to the baby.

47:52.971 --> 47:54.136
I--

47:54.205 --> 47:56.939
I-I honestly do not know.

47:57.041 --> 48:00.176
Look, this guy is dangerous,

48:00.278 --> 48:02.979
and you have
to stay away from him.

48:03.047 --> 48:04.981
The only person I need
    to stay away from is you.

48:05.049 --> 48:08.050
No. Jenn,
I swear on our son's life,
he's crazy.

48:08.152 --> 48:10.319
Listen to yourself.

48:10.922 --> 48:12.421
Look at you.

48:15.059 --> 48:16.893
We're done.

48:16.995 --> 48:18.160
No. Jenn.

48:20.465 --> 48:21.764
You okay?

48:21.866 --> 48:22.698
Let's go.

48:26.971 --> 48:28.337
Garrett.

48:29.440 --> 48:32.174
Oh, sorry.
            Got a little dizzy.

48:32.277 --> 48:35.411

48:57.168 --> 49:01.003
I knew Matt was volatile,
 but assault?

49:01.105 --> 49:04.240
I know.
    I was really shocked too.

49:04.342 --> 49:06.876
Jealousy will do that
to a man.

49:06.978 --> 49:07.843
Jealous?

49:07.946 --> 49:09.979
Of Garrett?

49:10.081 --> 49:12.949
Matt showed up
at the restaurant to talk.

49:13.017 --> 49:15.151
He said he was suspicious
of Garrett,

49:15.219 --> 49:17.853
that he had this feeling
that there was something
wrong with him.

49:17.956 --> 49:19.822
He said
        the same thing to me.

49:19.924 --> 49:21.357
I know jealous
when I see it.

49:21.459 --> 49:23.259
Hmm.

49:23.361 --> 49:26.862
I told him he could take
a lesson or two from Garrett
on how to be a better man.

49:26.965 --> 49:29.532
You don't think that's
what set him off, do you?

49:30.568 --> 49:32.134
No.

49:32.236 --> 49:33.970
I mean,
    if I've learned anything,

49:34.072 --> 49:37.340
it's that you cannot control
    the actions of others.

49:37.442 --> 49:39.275
Like this little guy

49:39.377 --> 49:42.345
who wakes me up
        every two hours to pee.

49:43.681 --> 49:45.214
Ladies.

49:45.316 --> 49:47.883
The babies are finally asleep
and dinner is ready.

49:47.986 --> 49:50.052
Thank you.

49:50.722 --> 49:52.621
Help me up.

49:54.192 --> 49:55.291
Here you go.

49:58.096 --> 49:59.962
Ooh!

50:00.064 --> 50:01.497
I'm not sure
      I'm gonna like this.

50:01.599 --> 50:03.132
It's just an herbal mix.

50:03.201 --> 50:06.569
It's supposed
to be good for the baby.
Antioxidants and stuff.

50:06.637 --> 50:10.106
You should start
taking it every day.
It worked wonders for my wife.

50:10.208 --> 50:13.442
John,
                it smells great.
                Can I help?

50:13.544 --> 50:15.678
Nope. All done.

50:15.780 --> 50:17.646
You did not need to cook for me.

50:17.749 --> 50:20.616
Oh, it's my pleasure.

50:20.685 --> 50:24.553
Besides, it's the least I can do
after all the trouble
we've put you through.

50:24.655 --> 50:26.856
It was no trouble, really.

50:26.958 --> 50:29.125
No, but I do
            wanna say again

50:29.227 --> 50:31.427
I'm so sorry
            for what happened.

50:31.496 --> 50:33.129
Oh, no. It was my fault.

50:33.197 --> 50:36.332
You warned me,
and I should have listened.

50:36.434 --> 50:39.335
-It was worth a try, I guess.
-I bet your forehead disagrees.

50:41.039 --> 50:45.174
Well, here's to those
whom we shed from our lives

50:45.243 --> 50:48.511
and to those we let in,
   including this little guy.

50:50.348 --> 50:51.147
- Cheers.
-     Cheers.

50:52.483 --> 50:53.916
Cheers.

50:56.254 --> 50:57.853
When is the due date exactly?

50:57.922 --> 50:59.922
Well, I'm supposed
    to be induced on the 20th

51:00.024 --> 51:02.725
unless this guy wants
    to pop out a little earlier.

51:02.794 --> 51:04.894
Well, the baby bags
 are all packed.

51:04.962 --> 51:06.796
We're ready to go
whenever he decides.

51:06.898 --> 51:09.365
Maybe he'll surprise us.

51:35.960 --> 51:38.260
What's that, Daddy?

51:39.730 --> 51:42.965
That is
when your brother arrives.

51:43.034 --> 51:44.233
But why so long?

51:44.335 --> 51:46.202
Oh, it'll be here
            before you know it.

51:46.304 --> 51:48.304
And I have a lot to do
        before then.

51:48.406 --> 51:51.073
A few weeks
after he gets here,
we're taking a trip.

51:51.175 --> 51:53.075
All of us, as a family.

51:53.144 --> 51:56.812
But I need you to be
   all packed and ready to go.
      Does that sound good?

51:56.914 --> 51:58.914
Will Mommy be there?

52:21.839 --> 52:23.439
Olivia.

52:23.508 --> 52:25.074
What do you want?
I fired you.

52:25.143 --> 52:28.444
I'm aware.
        You should invite me in.

52:28.546 --> 52:30.613
Why would I wanna do that?

52:30.681 --> 52:33.315
I don't think you'd want
   to have this talk outside.

52:33.417 --> 52:35.117
Too many ears.

52:38.856 --> 52:41.457
The kids are asleep.
How have you been?

52:42.126 --> 52:43.559
Unemployed.
Hmm.

52:43.628 --> 52:46.128
Well, you did that
to yourself.

52:46.230 --> 52:48.430
So, what's this about?

52:48.533 --> 52:52.234
From the first time
            I met you,
            something felt off.

52:52.336 --> 52:55.337
The conversations
            I overheard
            when you were alone.

52:55.406 --> 52:59.275
-I told you--
        -Oh, yes. The dead wife.
               Poor thing.

52:59.343 --> 53:04.013
You know, the other night,
there was something on the telly
about a missing baby.

53:04.081 --> 53:06.949
It made me think
        about your baby, Laura,

53:07.051 --> 53:10.452
why you didn't have
        a single photo of her

53:10.555 --> 53:13.022
or of your
                other daughter.

53:13.090 --> 53:15.791
Which led me to check
        the newspapers online,

53:15.893 --> 53:17.826
and I discovered this.

53:19.197 --> 53:22.064
Maybe you'd like
        to put that in a frame.

53:23.601 --> 53:25.167
And what's this
supposed to be?

53:25.269 --> 53:29.138
That's Laura, your child,
    or so you claim.

53:29.207 --> 53:31.874
Her real name is Sadie.

53:31.976 --> 53:34.443
Oh, don't bother
            with another lie.

53:34.545 --> 53:38.447
We both have
            far better things
            to do with our time.

53:39.483 --> 53:42.885
Besides, I know
                your real name,

53:42.987 --> 53:44.620
David Miller.

53:44.722 --> 53:46.622
I almost called the police.

53:46.724 --> 53:49.391
And then
                I had a thought.

53:49.460 --> 53:52.995
Maybe we could come
            to an arrangement.

53:53.064 --> 53:54.430
You're blackmailing me.

53:54.532 --> 53:57.666
No, love.
    I'm offering you protection.

53:58.803 --> 54:00.202
And if I say no?

54:00.304 --> 54:02.805
Then things would get
        rather unpleasant.

54:02.907 --> 54:04.940
The police
        would receive a call.

54:05.042 --> 54:08.077
Questions
                would be asked.

54:08.145 --> 54:10.412
Not an ideal situation
        for you

54:10.514 --> 54:11.981
or the children.

54:12.083 --> 54:13.449
No.

54:13.517 --> 54:16.518
What I'm proposing
            would work out
            for both of us.

54:18.756 --> 54:21.590
It'll be our little secret.

54:25.696 --> 54:26.629
How much?

54:27.698 --> 54:30.099
I'll take all the cash
        you have for now,

54:30.167 --> 54:31.900
and then we can
            figure out the rest.

54:31.969 --> 54:35.137
I think 25 grand
        would be about right.

54:35.206 --> 54:37.773
Where am I supposed to get
that kind of money?

54:37.875 --> 54:39.742
Where did you get
        all the money for this?

54:39.844 --> 54:41.844
Oh, I know.

54:41.946 --> 54:44.446
Your late wife's
             life insurance.

54:44.515 --> 54:46.382
What was it?
            Half a million?

54:46.450 --> 54:50.386
Funny how that
        all worked out for you.

55:13.811 --> 55:15.978
No one threatens my family.

55:23.721 --> 55:24.953
Matt Monroe?

55:25.823 --> 55:26.889
Yeah.

55:26.957 --> 55:28.657
You've been served.

55:28.726 --> 55:30.159
Have a nice day.

55:34.198 --> 55:37.599
Oh, God.

55:39.570 --> 55:42.805
-What do you want, Matt?
-A restraining order. Really?

55:42.907 --> 55:46.075
-You did this to yourself.
   -No, I didn't.

55:46.177 --> 55:49.011
Look, I think he has
something planned.

55:49.080 --> 55:50.479
<i>It has to do with you.</i>

55:50.548 --> 55:52.281
Do you hear yourself
      right now?

55:52.350 --> 55:54.116
You sound so paranoid.

55:54.185 --> 55:55.718
Okay, if I'm being
            so paranoid,

55:55.820 --> 55:58.420
why is the restraining order
    so wide I can't even
    go to our house?

55:58.489 --> 56:02.257
<i> Jenn, I can't even come home</i>
<i>with him living on our block.</i>

56:02.360 --> 56:04.727
I'm sure
        that's just standard.

56:04.829 --> 56:07.529
<i>It's-- It's not.</i>
<i>Trust me. I checked.</i>

56:07.598 --> 56:11.767
Look, I get things are
   not going well between us.

56:11.869 --> 56:14.903
I promised you
            I'm working on that.

56:14.972 --> 56:18.674
But why did you have
    to tell him about the clinic
    and the baby?

56:18.776 --> 56:20.642
I never said anything
    about that.

56:20.711 --> 56:23.979
You had to have
            because he threw it
            right into my face.

56:24.048 --> 56:25.714
I swear. I didn't tell him.

56:25.783 --> 56:27.716
Well, then how
                would he know?

56:28.953 --> 56:30.486
I don't know.

56:30.588 --> 56:32.755
<i>And you don't think</i>
<i>that is weird?</i>

56:32.823 --> 56:34.890
<i>Come on. Think of everything</i>
<i>that has happened.</i>

56:34.959 --> 56:36.558
I'll give him
        the night he found you.

56:36.627 --> 56:38.660
<i>But then moving in</i>
<i>across the street,</i>

56:38.729 --> 56:41.096
<i>and then me getting questioned</i>
<i>and arrested for assault?</i>

56:41.198 --> 56:43.132
<i>You think this is</i>
<i>all just coincidence?</i>

56:44.135 --> 56:45.868
I could have sworn
I locked the door,

56:45.936 --> 56:49.138
but somehow it was open
for the paramedics.

56:49.206 --> 56:53.475
Once I'm settled,
I can come by and help finish
setting up the baby's room.

56:53.544 --> 56:55.577
How did you know
    the nursery wasn't finished?

56:56.914 --> 56:58.380
I guessed.

57:02.720 --> 57:04.686
Listen, Matt, I hear you.
    I do.

57:04.755 --> 57:08.023
But I can't do this right now.
 Um, I'll have to call you back.

57:14.632 --> 57:15.664
Hey, Jenn.

57:15.766 --> 57:16.832
<i> Hey.</i>

57:16.901 --> 57:18.367
Um, I'm sorry to bother you.

57:18.436 --> 57:21.904
I was just wondering
if I could, um, ask you
for a huge favor.

57:22.006 --> 57:23.572
Absolutely.

57:23.674 --> 57:26.375
Um, I've run out
of a few things here,

57:26.444 --> 57:29.144
and I was wondering
if you would mind
running to the store for me.

57:29.246 --> 57:31.280
I'd be happy to watch the girls.

57:31.348 --> 57:33.649
Sure. Just give me the list
   and I'll drop the kids off.

57:33.751 --> 57:36.218
Great. Thanks. See you soon.

57:46.063 --> 57:47.362
-Hey.
            -Hey.

57:48.566 --> 57:50.766
Well, the girls
            are ready to rock.

57:50.835 --> 57:54.002
Definitely excited
   to spend some time
   with their Auntie Jennifer.

57:54.104 --> 57:56.505
Aw. Oh. Here's the list.

57:56.607 --> 57:57.973
Oh.

57:58.075 --> 57:59.508
That's it?

57:59.577 --> 58:02.211
Yeah. That's--
That's everything.
I don't know how I ran out.

58:02.279 --> 58:04.980
Oh, well, you've got
        more important things
        to focus on.

58:05.082 --> 58:06.849
Only a couple of days.

58:08.853 --> 58:11.386
Hey. You okay?
                 What's wrong?

58:11.455 --> 58:15.190
Oh, I'm okay.
I'm just a little stressed
about the delivery, that's all.

58:15.259 --> 58:18.160
All right.
        Well, I'll be back ASAP.

58:18.262 --> 58:19.561
I love you.

58:19.663 --> 58:20.562
Thanks again.

58:20.631 --> 58:21.797
Of course.

58:44.255 --> 58:45.120
Hey, Dad.

58:45.222 --> 58:46.455
Yeah, hon.

58:46.524 --> 58:47.756
I'm gonna go over
            to Garrett's

58:47.858 --> 58:49.892
because he forgot something
   for the girls.

58:49.960 --> 58:51.527
Can you just keep
            an eye on them?

58:51.629 --> 58:53.161
They're just napping
            in my room.

58:53.264 --> 58:55.130
I can go if you want me to.
                    That's okay.

58:55.232 --> 58:56.632
I could use
                the exercise.

58:56.734 --> 58:57.933
Okay. Got it covered.

58:58.035 --> 58:59.635
Okay, thanks.

59:53.223 --> 59:54.690
Now, why are you locked?

01:01:17.141 --> 01:01:18.840
- Hi.
<i>-  Hey.</i>

01:01:18.909 --> 01:01:22.277
I forgot to tell you.
    Mandy's due for a feeding
    at 2:00.

01:01:22.379 --> 01:01:25.347
No problem.
They're both sleeping right now.

01:01:25.449 --> 01:01:28.784
I'm just, uh--
I'm just folding laundry.

01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:35.090
Excellent.
Well, I'm almost done here.
Should be back pretty soon.

01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:36.591
Really? That quick?

01:01:36.694 --> 01:01:38.527
<i>Well, it wasn't</i>
<i>a long list.</i>

01:01:38.629 --> 01:01:40.962
You feeling okay?
        You sound a little off.

01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:43.565
<i>Yeah, I'm just--</i>
<i>I'm having a little back pain</i>

01:01:43.667 --> 01:01:45.267
<i>and just cramping a bit.</i>

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:47.002
Sounds like pre-labor.

01:01:47.104 --> 01:01:49.705
You're almost there.
            It's almost time.

01:01:50.708 --> 01:01:52.774
Yeah, c-could be.

01:01:52.876 --> 01:01:54.543
Um-- Oh, wait. You know what?

01:01:54.645 --> 01:01:57.345
I forgot to add something
to the list.

01:01:57.414 --> 01:01:59.214
<i>Um, could you</i>
<i>go back to the store</i>

01:01:59.283 --> 01:02:02.117
<i>and pick me up</i>
<i>some of that salted chocolate?</i>

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:04.553
<i>I've been having cravings.</i>

01:02:04.621 --> 01:02:06.354
Sure. No problem.

01:02:06.423 --> 01:02:08.690
Okay. Thanks. See you soon.

01:02:21.171 --> 01:02:22.904
<i>The mother of a baby</i>

01:02:22.973 --> 01:02:25.540
<i>who was kidnapped in Phoenix</i>
<i>three months ago</i>

01:02:25.609 --> 01:02:29.010
<i> caused quite a stir</i>
        <i> at this Westside</i>
        <i> fertility clinic today.</i>

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:33.081
<i>Kelly Lambert claims</i>
<i>that the staff is withholding</i>
<i>vital information</i>

01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:36.985
<i>that could lead</i>
<i>to the identity of the person</i>
<i>who kidnapped her child</i>

01:02:37.054 --> 01:02:42.224
<i>and that this person</i>
<i>might also be involved in</i>
<i>the violent murder-kidnapping</i>

01:02:42.326 --> 01:02:45.026
<i>that took place</i>
<i>in San Diego last week.</i>

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:48.330
<i>The baby that was taken</i>
<i>in San Diego--</i>
<i>I spoke to the father. Okay?</i>

01:02:48.398 --> 01:02:50.999
<i> He told me that their donor</i>
    <i> came from this clinic.</i>

01:02:51.068 --> 01:02:52.567
<i> My donor came</i>
    <i> from this clinic too. Okay?</i>

01:02:52.636 --> 01:02:54.836
<i> The Breck Fertility Clinic.</i>

01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:56.204
Oh, my God.

01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:58.940
The man who kidnapped my baby
called himself "Daddy."

01:02:59.042 --> 01:02:59.975
That's--

01:03:01.178 --> 01:03:02.611
That's what he said.

01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:05.347
It's him.

01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:07.816
I-I know it's him.

01:03:07.918 --> 01:03:11.086
<i> He's coming after</i>
        <i> all of his children.</i>

01:03:11.155 --> 01:03:12.921
<i> A spokesman for the clinic</i>

01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:16.725
<i>said that they are</i>
<i>contractually bound to protect</i>
<i>the privacy of their clients</i>

01:03:16.794 --> 01:03:20.762
<i>and would fight</i>
<i>any legal moves by Ms. Lambert</i>
<i>or law enforcement</i>

01:03:20.864 --> 01:03:22.397
<i> to open up their files.</i>

01:03:22.466 --> 01:03:25.801
<i>While admitting that there was</i>
<i>a break-in several months ago,</i>

01:03:25.903 --> 01:03:28.270
<i> a clinic spokesman</i>
            <i> had this to say.</i>

01:03:28.372 --> 01:03:30.772
<i>After a careful investigation</i>
<i>by our staff,</i>

01:03:30.841 --> 01:03:32.707
<i> it was determined</i>
        <i> that nothing was stolen</i>

01:03:32.776 --> 01:03:34.843
<i> and no private information</i>
   <i> was breached.</i>

01:03:34.912 --> 01:03:36.845
<i> Beyond that,</i>
    <i> we have no further comment.</i>

01:03:48.792 --> 01:03:49.958
Go!

01:04:29.933 --> 01:04:33.034
The light is green! Go!
I have a family emergency!

01:04:43.847 --> 01:04:45.213
Phoenix.

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:50.952
San Diego.

01:05:23.053 --> 01:05:24.552
Oh, my God.

01:05:24.655 --> 01:05:26.121
That's Mandy.

01:05:38.769 --> 01:05:41.002
Garrett.
        I didn't see your car.

01:05:41.071 --> 01:05:42.637
You know, you could've
        used the front door.

01:05:42.706 --> 01:05:44.139
Oh, I just forgot something.
                   Oh.

01:05:44.207 --> 01:05:46.241
Jennifer will be back
        any second now.

01:05:46.343 --> 01:05:48.576
Aah!

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:51.913
Matt, you were right.

01:05:51.982 --> 01:05:53.848
Garrett's been lying to us
   the whole time.

01:05:53.917 --> 01:05:55.650
That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

01:05:55.719 --> 01:05:58.753
No, but it's so much worse.
   I think he's the donor.

01:05:58.822 --> 01:06:00.055
What?

01:06:00.157 --> 01:06:01.556
<i> Connor's donor.</i>

01:06:01.658 --> 01:06:03.658
I think Garrett
            is the father.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:06.027
How the hell did he find us?

01:06:06.096 --> 01:06:10.031
I think he broke into the clinic
and he stole the information.

01:06:11.601 --> 01:06:15.770
And he's already kidnapped
   two little girls,

01:06:15.872 --> 01:06:17.105
<i> and I think we're next.</i>

01:06:17.174 --> 01:06:18.907
Okay, where are you?

01:06:18.976 --> 01:06:21.076
I'm just crossing the street.
I'm almost home.

01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:23.011
<i> Look, just go inside,</i>

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:24.512
lock the door
and call the police.

01:06:24.581 --> 01:06:26.448
<i> I'm gonna be there</i>
            <i> in ten minutes.</i>

01:06:26.516 --> 01:06:29.551
<i> Hey, does your dad</i>
            <i> still have his gun?</i>
                Yeah, he should.

01:06:29.653 --> 01:06:31.186
Matt, listen.
                I'm so sorry.

01:06:31.288 --> 01:06:32.654
<i> Look, don't be.</i>

01:06:32.756 --> 01:06:34.155
You had no idea.

01:06:34.257 --> 01:06:35.924
I'm sorry too, okay?

01:06:36.026 --> 01:06:38.193
<i> Babe, I love you.</i>

01:06:38.295 --> 01:06:39.627
I'm on my way.

01:06:44.735 --> 01:06:45.667
Dad?

01:06:46.837 --> 01:06:48.970
Dad, I need your help.

01:06:59.116 --> 01:07:01.349
- Hi.
-     <i> Hello.</i>

01:07:01.451 --> 01:07:03.485
Hey. Uh, where are you?

01:07:03.587 --> 01:07:05.954
<i> I'm close.</i>
        <i> I got your chocolates.</i>

01:07:06.056 --> 01:07:07.288
Thanks.

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:10.025
<i>You sure you're okay?</i>
<i>You sound a little stressed.</i>

01:07:10.093 --> 01:07:11.726
No, I'm-I'm fine.

01:07:11.795 --> 01:07:14.262
I-I'm just a little antsy.

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:15.930
How close are you?

01:07:16.033 --> 01:07:19.200
<i> I'll be home soon. Why?</i>

01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:22.003
I-I might take
the girls for a walk,

01:07:22.105 --> 01:07:24.639
so I might not be here
when you get back.

01:07:26.176 --> 01:07:28.243
<i> You sure</i>
            <i> that's a good idea?</i>

01:07:29.112 --> 01:07:31.179
Remember
what the doctor said.

01:07:31.281 --> 01:07:33.014
No stress.

01:07:34.818 --> 01:07:36.818
Think of the baby.

01:07:44.628 --> 01:07:46.961
We can probably hang up now.

01:07:51.068 --> 01:07:53.435
Garrett, whatever you're
planning on doing--

01:07:53.537 --> 01:07:55.336
I'm doing for my family.

01:07:58.141 --> 01:08:00.208
Oh, God.

01:08:01.378 --> 01:08:03.278
I just want you to know

01:08:03.346 --> 01:08:06.381
this wasn't
            how I planned it.

01:08:06.483 --> 01:08:08.683
I never intended
                to hurt you.

01:08:08.752 --> 01:08:09.984
I just want my son.

01:08:10.087 --> 01:08:12.287
He's not yours.

01:08:12.355 --> 01:08:13.421
But he is.

01:08:13.523 --> 01:08:15.790
And you know that now.

01:08:15.859 --> 01:08:18.393
When I lost my wife and kids
    in the accident,

01:08:18.495 --> 01:08:20.127
I thought
            I lost everything.

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:22.263
And then I remembered

01:08:22.365 --> 01:08:25.100
I donated sperm
                in college.

01:08:26.502 --> 01:08:29.804
All I have to do is find
         the rest of my children

01:08:29.906 --> 01:08:32.240
and my family
            will be whole again.

01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:34.776
Aah! Aah!

01:08:36.513 --> 01:08:37.845
It's time.

01:08:37.913 --> 01:08:39.647
Please, Garrett.

01:08:39.716 --> 01:08:41.950
Please don't do this. Please.

01:08:42.018 --> 01:08:45.653
Believe it or not,
        this is the safest way.

01:08:45.755 --> 01:08:47.555
For the baby anyway.

01:09:00.237 --> 01:09:01.769

Jenn.

01:09:24.127 --> 01:09:26.394
Matt, in here.
 John.

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:27.828
Oh, shoot.

01:09:27.898 --> 01:09:29.764
John, John. John, John.
Don't move. Don't move.

01:09:29.866 --> 01:09:31.232
You're gonna be okay?
                   I'm okay.

01:09:31.334 --> 01:09:32.966
Who did this?
                        Garrett.

01:09:33.036 --> 01:09:35.670
Where-- Where's Jenn, John?
I found her phone out front.
Where's Jenn?

01:09:35.772 --> 01:09:37.171
Garrett must have
           taken her.
Where?

01:09:37.274 --> 01:09:38.473
To his house.

01:09:38.542 --> 01:09:39.774
Across the street?
                   No, no, no.

01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:41.276
Where?
                His other house.

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:42.743
What other house, John?

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:45.546
The one where I originally
tracked him down for Jenn.

01:09:46.917 --> 01:09:48.383
Check her phone.

01:09:48.484 --> 01:09:49.617
Her searches.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.219
Acton?

01:09:51.321 --> 01:09:52.886
Okay. I'm gonna go get her.

01:09:52.988 --> 01:09:54.989
Matt.
John.

01:09:55.091 --> 01:09:56.157
-I'll bring her home.

01:09:56.226 --> 01:09:58.860
I promise.
        -Go.

01:09:58.929 --> 01:10:02.764
He needs immediate
medical attention.
I left the front door open.

01:10:02.866 --> 01:10:04.799
Okay. Okay.

01:10:04.901 --> 01:10:07.335
<i>Calculating route.</i>

01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:27.488
Breathe, Jenn.

01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:30.758
Just like we did in class.
Remember your exercises.

01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:33.528
What are you doing?

01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:34.696
Garrett, untie me.

01:10:36.233 --> 01:10:38.466
I'm protecting the baby.

01:10:38.535 --> 01:10:40.401
You need to take me
            to a hospital.

01:10:40.503 --> 01:10:41.903
I'm sorry, Jenn.

01:10:41.972 --> 01:10:44.172
This certainly isn't
            the way I wanted it.

01:10:44.241 --> 01:10:46.007
But a hospital is
            out of the question.

01:10:47.544 --> 01:10:49.944
This is what you get
for snooping around.

01:10:50.046 --> 01:10:53.081
So there's no one to blame
but yourself.

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:55.316
But don't worry.

01:10:55.385 --> 01:10:58.920
Women have been
giving birth from home
for thousands of years.

01:10:59.022 --> 01:11:00.722
Please, Garrett, no.

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:03.324
Aah!
Breathe.
Breathe through it.

01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:04.459
Breathe.

01:11:08.331 --> 01:11:12.133
There you go.
Just like we did in class.

01:11:17.507 --> 01:11:20.908
You're doing great.
There's nothing to worry about.

01:11:23.246 --> 01:11:25.813
I've watched
every home-birthing video
on the Internet.

01:11:27.384 --> 01:11:28.416
Oh, my God.

01:11:28.518 --> 01:11:30.685
You'd be amazed
at how many there are.

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:33.021
But just in case...

01:11:33.923 --> 01:11:36.391
we come across
            any complications...

01:11:38.461 --> 01:11:39.694
I'm prepared.

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:50.438
Help me!

01:11:50.507 --> 01:11:54.309
You know, I'm never one
to believe old wives' tales,

01:11:54.411 --> 01:11:56.477
but this tea
really did the trick.

01:11:56.579 --> 01:11:59.113
Please. Please call
        an ambulance. Please.

01:11:59.182 --> 01:12:02.350
No, we're gonna do this.
We're gonna do this together.

01:12:02.419 --> 01:12:04.352
No, think about the baby.

01:12:04.421 --> 01:12:05.987
Think about Connor.

01:12:06.056 --> 01:12:08.222
I know you
            don't want anything
            to happen to him.

01:12:08.325 --> 01:12:10.058
Of course not.

01:12:10.126 --> 01:12:13.227
Okay. So then you should
   take me to the hospital...

01:12:14.264 --> 01:12:15.330
so that he's safe.

01:12:15.398 --> 01:12:16.597
That's what you want.

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:19.267
You want him to be born
   healthy and strong, right?

01:12:19.336 --> 01:12:21.536
I know how much
            you care about him.

01:12:21.638 --> 01:12:22.837
Please, Garrett.

01:12:22.906 --> 01:12:25.840
I know you don't wanna lose
   another child, right?

01:12:29.212 --> 01:12:30.144
Nice try, Jenn.

01:12:32.615 --> 01:12:34.048
You should know me
well enough by now

01:12:34.117 --> 01:12:37.452
to know that I would never let
anything happen to my son.

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:39.554
Nothing is
more important than family.

01:12:45.862 --> 01:12:47.562
Come on. Come on, come on.

01:12:48.798 --> 01:12:51.199
That's right.
That's good. That's good.

01:12:51.301 --> 01:12:52.633
Big push, Jenn.

01:12:52.736 --> 01:12:54.769
Big push.
That's it. That's it.

01:12:56.373 --> 01:12:58.439
He's crowning.

01:13:03.613 --> 01:13:05.113
That's right, Jenn.
              Aah!

01:13:05.181 --> 01:13:07.548
Give me another big push.
Give me another big push.

01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:08.683
Push through it, Jenn.
                            Aah!

01:13:08.785 --> 01:13:09.751
There you go.

01:13:11.287 --> 01:13:13.488
There he is. He's coming.
Here he comes.

01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:16.057
Oh, wow.

01:13:16.159 --> 01:13:17.125
My boy.

01:13:18.495 --> 01:13:20.762
Oh!

01:13:23.233 --> 01:13:24.899
He's beautiful.

01:13:24.968 --> 01:13:28.903
-Garrett.
   -Oh, he's beautiful, Jenn.

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:32.874
My baby boy.

01:13:36.946 --> 01:13:38.579
Welcome to the world, Connor.

01:13:43.219 --> 01:13:45.553
I like the name, by the way.

01:13:45.655 --> 01:13:47.188
I think we'll keep it.

01:13:47.290 --> 01:13:49.023
Let me see him.

01:13:49.125 --> 01:13:50.458
Please.

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.260
Let me see my baby.

01:13:52.362 --> 01:13:53.694
I can't do that, Jenn.

01:13:54.864 --> 01:13:56.531
Untie me!

01:13:56.633 --> 01:13:58.199
Garrett,
            don't leave me here.

01:13:58.301 --> 01:14:00.234
I have to.

01:14:01.237 --> 01:14:03.304
It's the only way.

01:14:03.373 --> 01:14:05.206
You'll bleed out.

01:14:05.308 --> 01:14:07.408
It'll be slow, but painless.

01:14:08.611 --> 01:14:13.281
You'll just go to sleep
and then never wake up.

01:14:13.383 --> 01:14:14.682
The police will find you.

01:14:16.286 --> 01:14:17.585
I don't think so.

01:14:17.654 --> 01:14:20.822
I've already made arrangements
to get across the border.

01:14:20.924 --> 01:14:23.891
We already have
a nice home set up.

01:14:23.993 --> 01:14:25.693
The children
are gonna be so happy.

01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:28.429
No.

01:14:31.801 --> 01:14:33.134
Please Garret, let me see him.

01:14:33.236 --> 01:14:36.070
I'll tell him about you.

01:14:38.575 --> 01:14:40.541
About how much
you loved him.

01:14:41.678 --> 01:14:44.479
And thank you.
Thank you for our baby boy.

01:14:45.615 --> 01:14:47.215
He's perfect.

01:14:49.352 --> 01:14:50.685
No.

01:14:56.292 --> 01:14:57.692
No.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.994
No. Please.

01:15:07.203 --> 01:15:10.838
Help me! Help me!

01:16:42.265 --> 01:16:44.865
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:16:44.968 --> 01:16:48.269
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:16:48.371 --> 01:16:50.204
Oh, it's okay.

01:16:50.306 --> 01:16:51.672
It's okay.

01:16:51.774 --> 01:16:53.040
I know.

01:16:57.213 --> 01:16:58.145
Jenn?

01:17:00.116 --> 01:17:01.415
You should
                    be resting.

01:17:01.517 --> 01:17:02.984
Shh, shh, shh.

01:17:03.086 --> 01:17:06.253
You stay away from me.

01:17:06.356 --> 01:17:07.989
You know I can't
            let you take him.

01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:10.191
Go to hell.

01:17:10.293 --> 01:17:14.362
I've already been there.
        I'm not going back.

01:17:15.398 --> 01:17:16.931
Now, let me have my son.

01:17:17.033 --> 01:17:18.699
He's not yours.

01:17:18.801 --> 01:17:20.234
He'll never be yours.

01:17:49.265 --> 01:17:51.165
Daddy, get up.

01:17:51.234 --> 01:17:53.300
Come on, Daddy.
It's time to play.

01:17:53.369 --> 01:17:56.037
You promised
you'd play with us.

01:17:56.139 --> 01:17:57.772
Let's go play.

01:18:01.277 --> 01:18:03.110
Where are we going?

01:18:03.212 --> 01:18:04.912
You're taking me out here.
                   Chase us.

01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:08.049
Oh, you wanna be chased.
Oh, you're-- Oh, I got you.

01:18:08.151 --> 01:18:11.118
No, no, no, no.

01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:12.720
Come here.

01:18:21.264 --> 01:18:22.396
Ow.

01:18:27.603 --> 01:18:28.903
Hi.

01:18:30.106 --> 01:18:31.839
Hi.

01:18:40.883 --> 01:18:42.450
Hey, I'm here.

01:18:42.518 --> 01:18:44.685
You're here.
        I'm always here.

01:18:47.824 --> 01:18:50.925
Oh, my God.
        Those poor little girls.

01:18:51.594 --> 01:18:53.260
I know.

01:18:53.329 --> 01:18:55.129
We'll get them
        to their parents, okay?

01:18:56.899 --> 01:18:58.399
Connor, meet your daddy.

01:19:01.537 --> 01:19:03.037
Hi.

01:19:03.139 --> 01:19:04.505
Oh.

01:19:17.754 --> 01:19:22.156
What do you got?
No. No, we don't eat our toys.

01:19:22.225 --> 01:19:24.425
Unless we're teething.

01:19:24.494 --> 01:19:26.093
I bet we're teething.
        Huh?

01:19:26.162 --> 01:19:28.195
How are my two
favorite people?

01:19:28.297 --> 01:19:29.463
Hey.

01:19:29.532 --> 01:19:30.965
Where's my little guy?

01:19:31.067 --> 01:19:32.099
Oh.
           Look at this one.

01:19:32.201 --> 01:19:33.734
Come see Dad. Hi.

01:19:33.803 --> 01:19:35.503
He's getting bigger
            every day.

01:19:35.605 --> 01:19:37.004
Oh, look at that smile.

01:19:37.073 --> 01:19:38.839
Oh, how's my little boy?

01:19:38.908 --> 01:19:41.475
You mean
                <i> our</i> little boy.

01:19:42.979 --> 01:19:44.211
How's Mama?

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:45.212
She's good.
    Yeah?

01:19:45.314 --> 01:19:47.882
Better every day.
        Good.

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:50.317

  in your mouth?

01:19:50.386 --> 01:19:52.286

           "I got some keys."

01:19:52.355 --> 01:19:55.189
Is that a key?
           "I like to play
           with these keys."

01:19:55.258 --> 01:19:58.158

Oh-ho-ho-ho.
