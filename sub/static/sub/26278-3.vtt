William. It's a wedding.

00:50.647 --> 00:53.431
Weddings tend to bring
out the worst in people.

00:58.261 --> 01:00.024
I adore weddings.

01:00.149 --> 01:02.950
It always feels like love is in the air.

01:04.635 --> 01:06.569
Congratulations, Higgins.

01:06.694 --> 01:09.169
You mean Higgins-Newsome.

01:09.294 --> 01:10.739
What?

01:10.960 --> 01:14.380
Henry has decided to
hyphenate his last name.

01:14.727 --> 01:18.861
- Why?
- Well, it's a rather storied clan I'm joining.

01:18.986 --> 01:21.161
Being a Newsome is going
to be very much preferable

01:21.169 --> 01:22.682
to being a constable.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.506
All that responsibility
never sat well with me, Tom.

01:26.598 --> 01:29.398
- Somehow, we'll muddle through without you.
- Hmm.

01:29.896 --> 01:32.498
- Congratulations, Henry.
- Murdoch.

01:33.886 --> 01:36.122
(WHISPERING): How much
did you and the good doctor

01:36.135 --> 01:37.585
spend on your wedding gift?

01:38.370 --> 01:39.564
What's this?

01:39.866 --> 01:42.085
Just a little gift from your best man.

01:43.401 --> 01:45.868
- It's a pen.
- It's a Hanneman.

01:46.032 --> 01:48.352
I thought you could use it to
sign the wedding certificate.

01:49.970 --> 01:51.689
Thank you, George.

01:52.408 --> 01:54.471
You know, your friendship
has always meant so mu...

01:54.488 --> 01:56.426
All right, Higgins, let's...

01:56.442 --> 01:58.875
let's save that for
the speech, shall we?

02:01.615 --> 02:02.880
I'll tell you one thing.

02:02.943 --> 02:04.968
I'm looking forward to
walking into the Station House

02:04.981 --> 02:08.189
Monday morning and seeing a different
man sitting at Higgins' desk.

02:08.441 --> 02:10.963
Yes, there are a number
of strong candidates

02:10.989 --> 02:13.894
for Constable first class.
Have you made your decision yet?

02:13.942 --> 02:15.712
Hardly matters who we pick.

02:15.775 --> 02:18.144
It's called addition
through subtraction, Murdoch.

02:18.375 --> 02:20.282
Gents.

02:20.587 --> 02:21.974
Shall we?

02:22.099 --> 02:23.154
Are you sure you're ready, Henry?

02:23.166 --> 02:25.772
- Not even the slightest case of cold feet?
- No.

02:25.897 --> 02:28.071
Nothing could stop me
from marrying Ruth Newsome.

Roger? (STAMMERING)

02:52.113 --> 02:55.533
I am Rupert, you daft sweet boy.

02:55.601 --> 02:59.252
- I've simply shaved my chops.
- Henry!

02:59.377 --> 03:00.823
Are you hurt?

03:00.844 --> 03:04.505
- I'm fine, I think.
- Fine? You've been shot!

03:04.521 --> 03:06.875
Methinks the shot missed.

03:06.912 --> 03:10.187
- There's a bullet hole in his jacket.
- Oh...

03:15.911 --> 03:17.450
George...

03:19.047 --> 03:20.937
you saved my life.

03:24.557 --> 03:27.315
All right. Thank you, Rupert.

03:27.489 --> 03:29.280
- Brother.
- Yes.

03:29.317 --> 03:32.075
- You're quite welcome, "brother".
- Definitely strange.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.718
Are you quite all right, Henry?

03:33.776 --> 03:35.809
I think so, William.

03:38.089 --> 03:40.458
- 44 calibre.
- A hunting rifle.

03:40.490 --> 03:42.591
An accident, I'd imagine.

03:42.627 --> 03:45.642
- Likely the neighbours hunting grouse.
- With a rifle?

03:46.414 --> 03:48.164
They're Dutch.

03:48.915 --> 03:50.391
I'll go check outside,

03:50.407 --> 03:53.385
see if there's anyone
out there wearing clogs.

03:54.789 --> 03:56.542
Glad you're all right, Henry.

03:56.578 --> 03:58.107
Thank you.

04:00.197 --> 04:02.136
George, my jacket is ruined.

04:02.341 --> 04:05.084
Higgins! That's what you're
worried about? You're alive, man!

04:05.105 --> 04:07.616
Well, how can I get married now?

04:07.683 --> 04:09.322
Well, here, I'll swap you.

04:09.359 --> 04:11.040
Well, thank you, George!

04:11.434 --> 04:13.656
- You know, you really are... no...
- Higgins...

04:13.667 --> 04:16.288
Higgins, it's a jacket.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.503
All right, there.

04:19.628 --> 04:21.820
Crisis averted. Now,

04:21.873 --> 04:24.120
I'll explain to the ladies

04:24.367 --> 04:28.333
- why we've been delayed.
- Oh, one moment...

Geraldine Cholmondeley.

04:46.841 --> 04:49.058
You can call me Gigi.

04:49.090 --> 04:51.979
I'm Ruthie's cousin
from Ham Hill, Powick,

04:52.016 --> 04:54.185
- Worcestershire.
- I'm sorry, from what?

04:54.569 --> 04:57.069
You're a balmy old egg, aren't you?

04:57.095 --> 04:59.591
Come on, let's get boiled.

04:59.607 --> 05:01.350
Gigi, shush! Ahem.

05:01.834 --> 05:04.313
Now, George Crabtree, I...

05:04.355 --> 05:06.711
oh, I want you to meet my dear,
dear, dear, dear, dear cousin,

05:06.735 --> 05:09.156
this is Effie Newsome
of the Wexford Newsomes.

05:09.193 --> 05:12.066
Not too well off, poor devils,
but still they are Newsomes.

05:12.103 --> 05:13.459
Effie!

05:13.511 --> 05:16.913
George is Henry's best man.
Effie is my Maid of Honour, so...

05:16.915 --> 05:18.680
Matron of Honour.

05:18.753 --> 05:21.012
- Divorced.
- Right.

05:21.038 --> 05:23.396
- Ruth, I have something to tell you.
- Henry...

05:23.853 --> 05:25.923
Henry's been shot. What?!

05:25.933 --> 05:28.114
- He's fine, but he...
- Henny!

Um, Effie.

05:35.064 --> 05:37.269
I should say straight off, um,

05:37.296 --> 05:40.290
- Ruth has mentioned that you might be interested in...
- Save your breath.

05:40.295 --> 05:41.975
I just got out of one marriage,

05:41.986 --> 05:44.113
I'm hardly looking to race into another.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.976
Right. It's just, you
know how Ruth can get.

05:47.002 --> 05:49.665
I'd never get involved
with a copper anyway.

05:49.686 --> 05:51.416
I'm at Osgoode preparing for the bar

05:51.426 --> 05:53.338
and if there's one thing I've learned,

05:53.402 --> 05:55.886
it's policemen are the real criminals.

06:10.207 --> 06:13.291
- William, what's happened?
- Henry's been shot.

06:13.307 --> 06:16.154
- Dear God!
- Or rather, shot at.

06:16.279 --> 06:17.987
- Is he all right?
- He's fine.

06:18.008 --> 06:19.689
Found this by a tree in the garden.

06:19.742 --> 06:21.170
There's no sign of the shooter.

06:21.197 --> 06:22.951
The calibre matches the bullet.

06:23.135 --> 06:25.104
That looks like one of the Newsomes'.

06:25.178 --> 06:28.382
- The Newsomes keep guns?
- They keep all sorts of weapons, sir.

06:28.507 --> 06:31.467
Come, come Henry. You must sit down.

06:33.481 --> 06:34.854
All right.

06:34.860 --> 06:36.609
So, someone took it from here,

06:36.651 --> 06:39.598
went out into the garden, and
took a pot shot at Higgins.

06:39.614 --> 06:41.106
Ahem.

06:41.857 --> 06:43.711
Excuse me, gentlemen.

06:43.836 --> 06:46.994

remove this rifle from this room?

06:47.028 --> 06:49.064
What? No.

06:49.189 --> 06:51.128
We only came in a few moments ago.

06:51.138 --> 06:52.446
Who are you two?

06:52.725 --> 06:55.256
Constantine Kimberley and my son Pelham.

06:55.381 --> 06:57.368
The bride's uncle and cousin.

06:57.720 --> 07:02.022
- So, neither of you touched any of these guns?
- What? No.

Excuse us.

(OMINOUS MUSIC)

07:06.808 --> 07:10.196
We have no way to determine
exactly when the rifle was taken...

07:10.664 --> 07:13.306
but clearly, it was by
someone inside this house.

07:13.369 --> 07:15.439
Meaning they're likely
a guest at the wedding.

07:15.865 --> 07:18.954
I've just spoken to Ruth. We're
going to go ahead with the wedding.

07:19.027 --> 07:21.222
Are you sure you're feeling all right?

07:21.254 --> 07:24.437
- You look a little distraught.
- I'll be fine.

07:24.984 --> 07:27.436
I mean, you've just
had a brush with death.

07:27.457 --> 07:31.045
- It would be understandable.
- It's not that so much.

07:31.928 --> 07:34.013
When I came to, I...

07:34.138 --> 07:35.830
I thought I saw Roger.

07:36.511 --> 07:38.131
Roger Newsome?

07:38.413 --> 07:40.275
I thought I saw his ghost.

07:40.915 --> 07:42.544
I thought I was...

07:42.669 --> 07:44.703
in Hell, being punished for killing him.

07:44.713 --> 07:47.297
Henry. You didn't kill Roger Newsome.

07:47.329 --> 07:49.666
I was supposed to be watching
him, and I fell asleep.

07:49.703 --> 07:53.148
He went out for a haircut, and
he got shot. I was responsible.

07:53.164 --> 07:56.531
- He's mostly responsible.
- I still feel guilty.

07:56.820 --> 07:59.799
And if Ruth were ever to find
out, she'd leave me in a heartbeat.

08:00.609 --> 08:02.216

would be a good time to tell the

Well, no, that's not what
it was. I was trying to

09:14.318 --> 09:16.860

12:02.643 --> 12:04.027
I can't do it!

12:04.040 --> 12:06.171
- Ruth, you really must...
- OK, stop it. Stop it, Bingo!

12:06.184 --> 12:07.883
- You need to pull yourself together!
- No!

12:08.008 --> 12:09.836
No, I can't be a part of this.

12:13.601 --> 12:14.866
Ahem.

12:15.408 --> 12:17.652
(JULIA): William, who is that man?

12:17.816 --> 12:21.115
Oh... that's Ruth's cousin.

12:21.149 --> 12:23.355
He was in the room
where the gun was taken.

12:23.418 --> 12:25.844
- He does not look happy.
- No.

12:26.125 --> 12:28.535
Dearly beloved, here we are

12:28.569 --> 12:29.929
gathered on this

12:29.967 --> 12:32.181
finest of days to join

12:32.198 --> 12:34.039
Ruth Alfreda Newsome

12:34.056 --> 12:36.106
and Henry Hieronymus Higgins

12:36.119 --> 12:38.300
in holy matrimony.

12:38.334 --> 12:39.468
Where's Effie?

12:39.481 --> 12:41.015
She went to look for you.

12:41.751 --> 12:43.533
- Terribly sorry, do go on.
- Ah, yes.

12:43.571 --> 12:46.731
First I ask if there is any man present

12:46.754 --> 12:48.732
- who has any reason...
- I am. I am such a man!

12:48.761 --> 12:50.401
Dear Lord, Plummie, what
on earth are you doing?!

12:50.418 --> 12:53.208
You know we were meant to be
together, Ruthie. I love you.

12:53.221 --> 12:55.931
- I've always loved you.
- Stop, you're being a fool.

12:55.944 --> 12:59.125
No. This boor is only
marrying you for your money!

12:59.142 --> 13:02.054
- Please Ruthie, please!
- Come now, son, step down,

13:02.684 --> 13:05.542
- let's get some air.
- Oh!

13:06.173 --> 13:08.975
- (NERVOUS LAUGHING)
- Did you say that was her cousin?

13:09.766 --> 13:10.960
Newsomes...

13:10.981 --> 13:13.586
Do you, Ruth Alfreda Newsome,

13:13.711 --> 13:16.128
take this man to be your husband...

13:17.019 --> 13:19.045
to hold him and love him,

13:19.170 --> 13:21.130
to care for him and nurture him,

13:21.255 --> 13:23.739
in times of ailment and haleness,

13:23.777 --> 13:25.458
prosperity and ruin,

13:25.483 --> 13:30.023
in times of unending joy
and bottomless sorrow,

13:30.060 --> 13:33.359
for all the days and
nights granted unto you

13:33.401 --> 13:35.807
- by the Lord...
- Sh!

13:36.810 --> 13:38.749
So long as you shall live?

13:38.874 --> 13:40.351
I do.

13:40.398 --> 13:42.409
- (SIGHING)
- And do you,

13:42.443 --> 13:44.244
Henry Hieronymus Higgins

13:44.301 --> 13:46.629
take this woman to be your wife...

13:47.248 --> 13:49.554
- George, what are you are you doing?
- You're wearing...

13:49.586 --> 13:50.922
- you're wearing my jacket...
- George, what are you...

13:50.946 --> 13:52.400
Henry! The ring!

13:52.425 --> 13:54.240
Stand over there. I will get it.

13:55.005 --> 13:57.585
(EXCLAMATIONS OF SHOCK)

14:03.532 --> 14:05.994
Henny, you're not dead, are you?

14:06.200 --> 14:08.499
I don't think so... I...

14:08.520 --> 14:10.213
Everybody get back, give him some air.

14:10.394 --> 14:12.298
McNabb, Dimmick, close the front doors.

14:12.318 --> 14:14.743
- Nobody leaves the building.
- Henry, are you quite all right?

14:14.764 --> 14:16.895
I... I think... what...

14:16.916 --> 14:18.332
You were standing right there.

14:18.345 --> 14:19.912
If you hadn't gone for that ring...

14:21.517 --> 14:22.707
Thanks.

14:22.832 --> 14:24.660
George, you saved my life again!

14:24.785 --> 14:26.443
(LAUGHING)

14:29.220 --> 14:30.346
There.

14:30.426 --> 14:32.662
The mechanism for
lowering the chandelier.

14:33.011 --> 14:36.108
Why are there mechanisms
for lowering chandeliers?

14:36.949 --> 14:38.369
People have to clean them.

14:38.899 --> 14:40.672
Oh. Huh.

14:41.374 --> 14:43.471
It's been deliberately cut through.

14:43.673 --> 14:45.875
Someone is trying to harm Henry Higgins.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.318
So no one in there watching
the wedding could have done it.

14:48.342 --> 14:50.174
Rupert Newsome walked out.

14:50.299 --> 14:51.885
As did the Maid of Honour.

14:51.948 --> 14:54.773
And that nutcase of a cousin
who tried to stop the wedding.

14:57.217 --> 14:58.706
Is it over?

14:58.929 --> 15:00.912
I've missed it, haven't I?

15:00.988 --> 15:04.123
Oh, Gigi, you really are a fathead!

15:07.517 --> 15:10.485
I was simply unable to
bear witness to such a...

15:10.825 --> 15:12.733
- tragedy.
- Tragedy?

15:12.750 --> 15:14.682
Oh, come now.

15:14.896 --> 15:17.070
Henry Higgins, a Newsome? (SCOFFING)

15:17.095 --> 15:18.986
Pah. No!

15:19.036 --> 15:21.155
It would be an insult to
the Newsome family name,

15:21.184 --> 15:23.377
one from which we might never recover.

15:24.066 --> 15:26.941
- I thought you liked Henry.
- As did I.

15:27.021 --> 15:29.559
But this morning, I got to thinking.

15:29.684 --> 15:31.083
For instance,

15:31.345 --> 15:33.787
what would the Phanshaws think?

15:35.321 --> 15:38.186
- I don't know. What?
- Well, just picture it!

15:38.686 --> 15:42.073
The Phanshaws come round for
a nice dinner with the Newsomes

15:42.531 --> 15:44.637
and there's Henry Higgins.

15:49.419 --> 15:51.411
So, Ruthie hasn't married?

15:51.596 --> 15:53.851
It seems that someone
didn't want her to.

15:53.976 --> 15:55.595
Where did you go when you walked out?

15:55.650 --> 15:57.936
The garden. I needed some
air to calm my nerves.

15:57.974 --> 16:00.707
He has rather some trouble with
his nerves, don't you, Pelham?

16:00.719 --> 16:02.426
Yes. The doctor says I need fresh air

16:02.447 --> 16:04.977
and lots of it. He says
that's the only thing. Say,

16:05.464 --> 16:07.335
where has Ruth gone?

16:07.957 --> 16:09.849
- Did anyone see you?
- I doubt it.

16:10.576 --> 16:13.941
But we were together. I
was with him the whole time.

16:14.241 --> 16:15.922
(DISTANT HORSE NEIGHING)

16:15.964 --> 16:19.840
No, fine, I wasn't off looking
for Ruth. I was smoking.

16:19.866 --> 16:22.714
Smoking? So, you were
going to miss the wedding?

16:23.045 --> 16:25.120
- That was the aim.
- You're the Maid of Honour.

16:25.151 --> 16:26.549
- Matron.
- Nevertheless.

16:26.565 --> 16:28.702
I was bloody well tired
of the whole bloody thing

16:28.713 --> 16:30.494
and I thought I'd nip out for a puff.

16:30.509 --> 16:32.107
Hang me.

16:32.333 --> 16:34.203
I was asleep.

16:34.282 --> 16:36.724
- I can prove it.
- All right.

16:36.761 --> 16:40.696
You see, I was dreaming
that Ruthie and I were lions

16:40.885 --> 16:43.722
and we were prancing
about in a field of lilies,

16:43.738 --> 16:45.603
back home at Ham Hill.

16:45.650 --> 16:47.919
Oh. No, that's not proof.

16:48.044 --> 16:50.835
- No. Of course.
- Why would you decide

16:50.856 --> 16:54.375
to lie down and fall asleep when
the wedding was about to be begin?

16:54.396 --> 16:55.908
No, no. You dear man.

16:55.956 --> 16:58.420
You see, I have a
beastly medical condition.

16:58.467 --> 17:00.836
- That causes you to fall asleep?
- Yes, that's right.

17:00.846 --> 17:03.486
- I can't recall the name of it...
- Narcolepsy.

17:03.510 --> 17:04.750
No, that's not it.

17:04.813 --> 17:06.652
Narcolepsy is the medical condition

17:06.662 --> 17:08.375
- that causes you to fall asleep.
- To fall asleep...

17:08.390 --> 17:11.147
And how would you know what
causes me to fall asleep?

17:11.327 --> 17:13.807
- Well, I uh...
- Say...

17:13.932 --> 17:16.165
that stout fellow over there.

17:17.452 --> 17:20.194
He's not one of those... Never mind.

17:20.227 --> 17:22.138
I'll find out for myself.

17:22.212 --> 17:23.648
- Toodle pip!
- Where were you smoking your cigarette?

17:23.673 --> 17:26.425
- Outside.
- Outside where?

17:26.451 --> 17:27.974
I don't know. Who cares?

17:28.001 --> 17:29.981
Why would I want to
kill little Henry anyway?

17:30.060 --> 17:33.102
Now, quit stalling and go
on and get me that necklace.

17:40.850 --> 17:43.865
- Rupert?
- Oh, please!

17:43.897 --> 17:46.897
we're old friends now. Call me Bingo.

17:47.254 --> 17:49.778
Right. Well, I've heard
a funny story just now.

17:49.815 --> 17:52.042
Oh? I love funny stories.

17:52.063 --> 17:55.004
Yes, well, this one involves you
and a string of stolen pearls.

17:55.129 --> 17:58.147
Stolen? They were a wedding gift.

17:58.178 --> 18:01.661
When Effie ceased to be
wed, they ceased to be hers.

18:01.786 --> 18:04.771
Moomama would hardly have
wanted them worn by a divorcée.

18:04.782 --> 18:08.516
She would positively die...
if she weren't dead already.

18:09.162 --> 18:10.975
Dysentery, you know.

18:12.866 --> 18:14.688
She was visiting Croydon.

18:14.756 --> 18:16.500
Bad air.

18:17.393 --> 18:19.048
Perhaps I could just
have a look at them?

18:19.173 --> 18:21.575
- Whatever for?
- To finish the story.

18:21.596 --> 18:23.116
A picture is worth a
thousand words and all that.

18:23.140 --> 18:25.115
Well, you'll just have to wait.

18:25.131 --> 18:28.114
I've wrapped them up and given
them to Ruth as a wedding present.

18:32.385 --> 18:33.924
<i>One of the gifts?</i>

18:33.945 --> 18:35.841
How am I supposed to know which one?

18:35.862 --> 18:37.402
Well, presumably it will say

18:37.418 --> 18:39.918
"To Ruru, Love Bonny-bon"

18:39.950 --> 18:41.941
or some such nonsense.
Now, give me my speech.

18:41.978 --> 18:45.612
Your speech is safe. You can
have it once I have my pearls.

18:47.114 --> 18:49.652
(SIGHING HEAVILY)

- Sh.

How about we take a little stroll

19:05.983 --> 19:08.535
and get ourselves a good reminder

19:08.551 --> 19:12.092
of all nature has to offer, what?

Here he is!

Here's the fiend!

Oof!

Don't you move a solitary
muscle, Mr. Crabtree...

19:20.824 --> 19:23.697
or should I call you
Mr. Criminal Mastermind?

19:23.739 --> 19:25.673
Don't answer that. I
don't care what you think.

19:25.715 --> 19:27.212
All that matters is that you spend

19:27.233 --> 19:29.565
the rest of your
natural life behind bars.

19:29.690 --> 19:32.139
I hereby declare a citizen's arrest.

19:39.199 --> 19:41.184
- What for?
- Well, first of all,

19:41.210 --> 19:44.315
I don't exactly fancy the liberties
you're taking with my cousin.

19:44.337 --> 19:46.327
Ugh! But more importantly,

19:46.343 --> 19:49.001
- you stole my wedding gift for Ruth.
- No!

19:49.126 --> 19:51.544
I am not and I did not.

19:51.555 --> 19:54.318
I told you about it and two
minutes later, it was gone.

19:54.349 --> 19:57.196
- If you didn't steal those pearls, who did?
- Pearls!

19:57.238 --> 19:59.276
You were going to give
me Moomama's pearls?

19:59.286 --> 20:01.640
I was. It was to be a surprise.

20:01.677 --> 20:03.143
But I love pearls...

20:03.626 --> 20:05.060
and surprises...

- Oh, I know, Ruthie, I know.
- (RUTH CRYING)

I can't believe you'd
do this to me, George!

20:13.471 --> 20:15.783
And betray dear old Effie like that?

20:15.820 --> 20:19.092
- I didn't...
- You are just jealous, aren't you? You're a...

- Toad?

- A pitiable toad!
- Toad!

George. You are my best man
and you're ruining our wedding.

What've I missed?

20:39.600 --> 20:42.143
They've postponed the
wedding until tomorrow.

20:42.432 --> 20:45.090
They say there's enough room
for us all to stay the night.

Excellent.

20:49.397 --> 20:52.717
Oh, William, there's
something you should see.

20:55.264 --> 20:57.481
Since there's a thief in our midst,

20:57.486 --> 20:59.835
I thought I would lock
the ring away overnight.

20:59.960 --> 21:02.440
Look. The dial's been chipped.

- Mm.

Oh. But Father said to
open it after I'm married.

21:28.376 --> 21:30.951
Yes but whoever was
trying to break into this

21:30.972 --> 21:32.453
may be after this letter.

21:32.485 --> 21:34.234
But Father said to open
it after I'm married.

21:34.245 --> 21:35.673
I need to examine it.

21:35.721 --> 21:37.643
It may tell us who was
trying to kill Henry.

But Father said to open
it after I'm married.

promised not to open it? Hmm?

21:47.173 --> 21:49.862

Need what back?

- The necklace.
- Well, no.

right in and take the necklace.

35:06.828 --> 35:08.951
- Oh sir, thank you!
- Higgins, get off!

35:09.418 --> 35:13.426
Every account empty or overdrawn.

35:13.458 --> 35:16.089
And your signature is
on every withdrawal.

35:18.191 --> 35:20.160
I don't understand...

35:20.617 --> 35:22.330
You took the money.

35:22.787 --> 35:24.300
I didn't.

35:24.694 --> 35:28.256
The Toronto house, on
D'Arcy Street, was sold.

35:28.319 --> 35:30.041
Miss Newsome was going to move there

35:30.057 --> 35:33.125
after she was married,
thereby exposing your theft.

35:34.375 --> 35:36.939
Yes, quite right.

35:37.143 --> 35:38.578
I did it.

35:38.877 --> 35:40.873
- You did?
- Yes.

35:40.884 --> 35:44.634
I spent it all on booze and
cigars and other sundries.

35:45.594 --> 35:49.012
Great fun, but obviously
I regret it now.

35:49.054 --> 35:51.487
But why would you need to send $80,000

35:51.524 --> 35:54.412
to a bank account in San
Francisco to purchase "sundries"?

35:54.470 --> 35:56.151
Hoo.

35:56.276 --> 35:58.142
Good question.

35:58.978 --> 36:00.427
Ginseng?

36:01.068 --> 36:03.915
The important thing is, I did it.

36:06.692 --> 36:08.500
Mystery solved.

36:13.689 --> 36:15.728
I hate you, George Crabtree.

36:15.754 --> 36:18.443
Yes, and you have every reason
to. But that's the thing, Ruth!

36:18.464 --> 36:21.285
You have no reason to
be angry with Henry.

36:21.327 --> 36:25.004
Look, I'm the one who wrote that
speech and the fact of the matter is,

36:25.025 --> 36:26.889
I made the whole thing up.

36:28.213 --> 36:29.637
What?

36:29.678 --> 36:32.630
I mean, it's true on
the day that Roger died,

36:32.646 --> 36:34.642
he was determined,

36:34.689 --> 36:37.782
adamant even, that he
go off and get a haircut

36:37.982 --> 36:39.716
for his court appearance.

36:39.900 --> 36:42.259
Nevertheless, it was Henry who said,

36:42.290 --> 36:45.705
"No, no, no. You mustn't.
It's far too dangerous."

36:45.941 --> 36:49.760
Then, later, while again, Henry

36:49.776 --> 36:52.203
was off getting us all our suppers,

36:52.219 --> 36:54.645
I fell asleep.

36:54.871 --> 36:56.662
Roger left.

36:56.925 --> 36:58.847
I'm the one responsible.

36:58.894 --> 37:00.591
Oh!

37:00.716 --> 37:03.858
Oh, you really are
the worst, aren't you?

37:04.236 --> 37:06.431
Yes. Yes, I am.

37:06.489 --> 37:08.675
You are so jealous of Henry

37:08.706 --> 37:11.669
dear sweet Henry, your best
friend in the whole world...

37:11.684 --> 37:15.682
that you would go and tell a
host of lies on his wedding day?

37:15.850 --> 37:17.389
What, out of spite?

37:17.668 --> 37:20.062
- Jealousy?
- Yes. That's what I did.

37:20.110 --> 37:21.665
Now that it's settled,

37:22.106 --> 37:23.992
will you still marry Higgins?

37:24.013 --> 37:25.520
What?

37:26.591 --> 37:28.524
That Roger business
doesn't have anything to do

37:28.545 --> 37:29.968
with why we're not getting married.

37:29.989 --> 37:31.602
- It doesn't?
- Of course not.

37:31.681 --> 37:33.409
I could have forgiven him for that.

37:33.446 --> 37:35.216
Well, then the wedding is still on.

37:35.273 --> 37:37.201
We're destitute, George.

37:38.730 --> 37:40.699
Henry would never marry me now.

37:41.183 --> 37:43.873
I have a feeling he could be convinced.

37:44.314 --> 37:45.921
Oh, Ruthie!

37:47.152 --> 37:49.409
- Of course I'll still marry you!
- But...

37:49.534 --> 37:51.096
but I have nothing.

37:51.221 --> 37:53.796
But we will have everything.

38:02.915 --> 38:04.234
(JULIA): Presumably the thief

38:04.255 --> 38:06.351
is the one who tried
to break into the safe,

38:06.413 --> 38:09.029
but Mr. Newsome would
have that combination.

38:09.943 --> 38:11.482
Have a look at this.

38:12.233 --> 38:15.979
There appears to be two distinctly
different sets of signatures.

38:16.162 --> 38:17.571
When he's writing a cheque

38:17.581 --> 38:20.124
to the tobacconist or for an automobile,

38:20.371 --> 38:22.851
it's slanted, messy.

38:23.034 --> 38:25.188
But for a significant sum,

38:25.377 --> 38:27.789
it's neat and controlled.

38:28.440 --> 38:29.927
Forgery?

38:30.052 --> 38:31.467
But who?

38:32.139 --> 38:35.533
Someone who obviously knew
about the D'Arcy house.

38:35.717 --> 38:37.476
Someone in the family.

38:38.007 --> 38:41.715
I hate to admit it, but perhaps
it's Ruth Newsome herself.

38:42.424 --> 38:43.974
Me?

38:43.990 --> 38:47.158
Oh, that's nonsense. I don't
know a thing about bank doodahs.

38:47.168 --> 38:48.681
Uncle Connie takes care of all that.

38:48.692 --> 38:51.138
Your uncle was in charge
of the family finances?

38:51.139 --> 38:53.687
Of course. Oh!

38:53.729 --> 38:55.087
We should ask him who took the money.

38:55.111 --> 38:57.795
He left the wedding
before the chandelier fell.

38:57.920 --> 39:00.096
Yes, but he was supposedly with his son.

39:00.122 --> 39:01.683
(EFFIE): No, he wasn't.

39:02.639 --> 39:06.094
I was smoking a cigarette and saw
Plum walking the gardens alone.

39:06.787 --> 39:08.837
Leaving your uncle unaccounted for.

39:08.862 --> 39:12.165
But why would Mr. Newsome
lie and claim responsibility?

39:12.333 --> 39:13.678
Perhaps they colluded.

39:13.737 --> 39:15.422
Or he was angry.

39:15.863 --> 39:17.179
What do you mean?

39:17.658 --> 39:20.016
I've witnessed Rupert's
temper more than once.

39:20.141 --> 39:21.633
He might be trying to kill the man.

39:22.137 --> 39:23.962
(MEN SCREAMING)

39:30.644 --> 39:33.758
- It was an accident, man! Listen to me!
- No!

39:33.845 --> 39:35.603
I just needed to borrow a little capital

39:35.624 --> 39:37.385
for an opportunity in California.

39:37.409 --> 39:39.377
I was going to have the money
back inside of your accounts

39:39.388 --> 39:41.405
- inside of a fortnight.
- I am not listening!

39:41.941 --> 39:44.132
It was a sure thing.

39:44.920 --> 39:47.257
But then the quake hit Frisco and,

39:47.273 --> 39:49.333
well, it wasn't so sure anymore.

39:49.391 --> 39:52.133
I had to borrow more money to
make back the money I'd lost

39:52.148 --> 39:53.924
and delay the wedding
so you wouldn't find out

39:53.935 --> 39:56.128
- until I could buy back the Toronto house...
- Silence!

39:56.152 --> 39:58.641

prepare to die, will you?

- Mr. Newsome!

40:00.438 --> 40:03.621

be charged with attempted murder.

40:16.547 --> 40:20.619
Thank you, Mr. Newsome.
The sword, you idiot.

40:25.462 --> 40:26.980
Constantine Kimberley,

40:27.028 --> 40:30.591
you are under arrest for the thrice
attempted murder of Henry Higgins.

40:31.733 --> 40:33.293
What?

40:40.085 --> 40:41.950
To be honest,

40:43.231 --> 40:45.506
the pearls look better on Ruthie anyway.

40:46.866 --> 40:49.724
I should say, I'm sorry about
everything that happened.

40:49.750 --> 40:52.786
Effie. I just want to
get through the wedding.

41:28.092 --> 41:30.522
Well, it's spotted, dear.

41:30.585 --> 41:33.527
Horses don't have spots, Henry.

41:33.979 --> 41:35.565

41:35.599 --> 41:38.365
best of luck to you. I suppose I'll
be seeing you at work after all.

41:38.386 --> 41:40.902
Now, George, now, you must promise

41:40.934 --> 41:43.891
that you two will come and have
supper with us sometimes, yes?

41:43.912 --> 41:45.372
No, no, no. No, absolutely not.

41:45.393 --> 41:48.209
Look, I have saved Henry's
life three times this weekend.

41:48.267 --> 41:51.245
You wouldn't even be getting married
if it wasn't for me. All I want

41:51.261 --> 41:53.914
is never to lay eyes on Effie again.

41:53.930 --> 41:56.473
Oh, no! George, I know that
you don't care for Effie.

41:56.487 --> 41:58.727

clear, so I've decided

lay eyes on you again?
