00:01.835 --> 00:05.999
<i>Theorizing that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,</i>

00:06.072 --> 00:09.007
<i>Dr. Sam Beckett stepped
into the Quantum Leap accelerator...</i>

00:09.075 --> 00:11.066
<i>and vanished.</i>

00:16.483 --> 00:19.782
<i>He awoke to find himself
trapped in the past,</i>

00:19.853 --> 00:22.879
<i>facing mirror images
that were not his own...</i>

00:22.956 --> 00:27.188
<i>and driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.</i>

00:27.260 --> 00:32.527
<i>His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,</i>

00:32.598 --> 00:36.968
<i>who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.</i>

00:37.037 --> 00:41.406
<i>And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,</i>

00:42.776 --> 00:45.210
<i>striving to put right
what once went wrong...</i>

00:45.278 --> 00:47.678

that his next leap...</i>

00:47.747 --> 00:49.738

00:58.324 --> 01:01.316
<i>What the hell?
You heard me.!</i>

01:01.394 --> 01:03.885
Hands up!

01:03.963 --> 01:07.990
Everyone stay calm. We'll get
this over with and be on our way.

01:09.335 --> 01:11.997
Keep me covered
while I shut the blinds.

01:15.475 --> 01:17.807
Don't fall apart on me now,
little brother.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.907
Oh, boy.

02:47.233 --> 02:51.033
<i>As usual when I leap,
I didn't have a clue as to who I was,</i>

02:51.104 --> 02:53.265
<i>or for that matter,
why I was robbing a bank.</i>

02:53.339 --> 02:56.934
<i>But I did know fear when I saw it,
and I saw it everywhere.</i>

02:57.010 --> 02:59.570
<i>I also had a strange feeling
about this place.</i>

02:59.646 --> 03:01.580
<i>It seemed familiar.</i>

03:01.648 --> 03:06.210
<i>Check his office. I want Vernon out here now.</i>

03:06.286 --> 03:08.880
You folks keep
those hands up high.

03:08.955 --> 03:12.721
<i>Don't even think about going
for that alarm button.</i>

03:15.962 --> 03:18.089
Fill it!

03:18.164 --> 03:22.066
$37,893.19.

03:22.135 --> 03:24.126
Not a penny more,
not a penny less.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.933
I don't have that much cash.

03:27.507 --> 03:29.441
Open the vault.

03:29.509 --> 03:35.243
We can't. Mr. Vernon's the only one who has
the combination. Neil Walters, is that you?

03:36.282 --> 03:38.750
- You Bill Walters's boys?
- Never mind who we are.

03:38.818 --> 03:40.410
Bill Walters?

03:40.486 --> 03:42.317
Vernon isn't here!
He isn't here!

03:42.388 --> 03:44.754
Where is he?

03:44.824 --> 03:48.225
Out of town on business. He won't
be back till later this afternoon.

03:50.530 --> 03:55.627
Damn it! Maybe we should go on and get
out of here fore things get out of hand.

03:55.702 --> 04:00.105
And go where? We come this
far, we can't turn back now.

04:00.173 --> 04:02.164
Sure we can.
Nobody's been hurt.

04:02.242 --> 04:06.611
We just, uh-W-W-We go out
that back door over there.

04:06.679 --> 04:08.647
<i>What's that?</i>

04:08.715 --> 04:11.445
What's it sound like?
Nobody move!

04:12.452 --> 04:15.353
Willie, you check out the back.
John, watch the door.

04:15.421 --> 04:19.152
Nobody move! Just keep those hands
nice and high where I can see 'em.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.022
Nobody.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.294
Somebody must be
in that back office.

04:28.368 --> 04:30.359
I'll take a look.

04:45.551 --> 04:48.315
That was stupid.
That was really stupid!

04:48.388 --> 04:50.822
Take it easy. Yelling at
her is not gonna do any good.

04:50.890 --> 04:52.824
Come on.
Get out of there.

04:52.892 --> 04:54.826
<i>Go on.</i>

04:56.195 --> 04:58.129
All right.
All right!

04:58.197 --> 05:00.665
Somebody turn that alarm off.

05:00.733 --> 05:02.724
Turn it off!

05:12.312 --> 05:14.041
All right.
Come on. Move!

05:16.282 --> 05:19.547
Back over there.
Move it.

05:19.619 --> 05:22.588
<i>All right, smart boy.
What do you suggest we do now?</i>

05:22.655 --> 05:25.317
<i>Like I said,
we can still go out the back way.</i>

05:25.391 --> 05:27.552
Too late! Mundy just
pulled up across the street.

05:29.629 --> 05:32.097
That would be
Police Chief Clyde Mundy.

05:32.165 --> 05:36.329
Uh, Sam, I think we need to take a
trip to the little bank robbers' room.

05:36.402 --> 05:38.427
Uh, excuse me.
I, uh-

05:38.504 --> 05:40.699
I gotta-

05:40.773 --> 05:42.900
You need to go to the
bathroom now? Yeah.

05:42.975 --> 05:44.909
L- I-I-I gotta go.

05:44.977 --> 05:47.241
When you gotta go,
you gotta go.

05:49.048 --> 05:52.211
<i>How do I keep getting into these situations?
Don't look at me.</i>

05:54.420 --> 05:56.388
What's going on, Al? Huh?

05:58.458 --> 06:02.656
You're William Walters Jr.,
but everybody calls you "Willie. "

06:02.729 --> 06:05.527
It's the 22nd
of December, 1971.

06:08.801 --> 06:11.167
Where am I?

06:11.237 --> 06:13.432
You're home, Sam.
You're in Elk Ridge, Indiana.

06:13.506 --> 06:15.974
I'm- I'm
home? Mm-hmm.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.279
No wonder everything
seemed so familiar.

06:21.347 --> 06:24.282
Yeah. Well, your memory's
a little Swiss-cheesed, you know.

06:24.350 --> 06:28.047
It's '71.
My dad's still alive.

06:30.323 --> 06:34.919
I'm-I'm home and-and...
my dad's still alive.

06:37.830 --> 06:40.958
Willie Walters?

06:41.033 --> 06:43.001
I knew a guy named Willie,
Willie Walters.

06:43.069 --> 06:47.403
Uh, a couple years older than me.
He- He- He had a couple of brothers.

06:47.473 --> 06:50.237
Uh-huh.
And-And, uh-

06:50.309 --> 06:52.243
<i>Damn, I can't remember.</i>

06:52.311 --> 06:58.079
Well, the big one is Neil. He's a couple
years older than you. He's a loose cannon.

06:58.151 --> 07:01.712
He enlisted
in the Marine Corps in '69,

07:01.788 --> 07:04.780
and then he took a compassionate
discharge a year later.

07:04.857 --> 07:08.054
Why?
Uh, oh, his father died,

07:08.127 --> 07:10.618
and he came back to take charge
of the family farm.

07:10.696 --> 07:15.258
Uh, the younger one is John. He's still in high
school. He's never been in any kind of trouble.

07:15.334 --> 07:18.531
Yeah, until now.
What about Willie?

07:18.604 --> 07:20.731
Willie
- Indiana State University, honor student.

07:20.807 --> 07:23.708
He didn't come back home in time.
In time for what?

07:23.776 --> 07:25.710
Uh, to save the family farm
from foreclosure.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.178
Seems they were late
a couple of months on a loan.

07:28.247 --> 07:33.116
$37,893-
And 19 cents.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.814
Wh-They're robbing the bank
to pay the bank?

07:35.888 --> 07:38.322
Well, that has
a certain symmetry to it.

07:38.391 --> 07:40.325
More like insanity.
I don't believe this.

07:40.393 --> 07:42.361
Why does Ziggy say I'm here?

07:42.428 --> 07:46.228
In the original history, the
brothers were killed trying to escape.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.393
<i>Ziggy says there's
an 88.9% chance...</i>

07:49.469 --> 07:51.994
that you're here to see
that the brothers surrender.

07:52.071 --> 07:56.405
Look, uh, ask Ziggy what happens
to the farm after they lost it.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.444
What? Hey.

07:58.511 --> 08:02.072
You're not thinking of going through with
bank robbery? Just ask Ziggy what happened.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.480
Willie.
Willie, you better get out here.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.736
Hello?

08:25.805 --> 08:28.035
Willie, is that you?

08:29.742 --> 08:32.438
Now look, son,
you might as well talk to me.

08:32.511 --> 08:35.106
Everybody saw you
and your brothers go into the bank.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.412
Hello, Chief Mundy. How
ya been? How've I been?

08:38.484 --> 08:41.317
Willie-

08:41.386 --> 08:44.379
I've been fine until now.

08:44.457 --> 08:46.391
Now, uh, look, son.

08:46.459 --> 08:49.758
This thing is on the verge
of gettin' away from us here.

08:49.829 --> 08:52.423
Now listen to me, Chief. We don't
want anybody to get hurt here.

08:52.498 --> 08:54.432
<i>Well, that's good.
Uh, so-</i>

08:54.500 --> 08:58.732
Thank you, Flo. Why don't you boys just
throw out your guns and come on out?

09:00.506 --> 09:02.531
He knows who we are.

09:02.608 --> 09:06.271
- We should've worn them wigs.
- Shut up! What's he want?

09:06.345 --> 09:08.404
- He wants us to come out.
- Not until we see Vernon.

09:08.481 --> 09:10.949
Vernon? Gus Vernon?

09:11.017 --> 09:14.544
Of course, Gus Vernon.
He's bank president, isn't he?

09:14.620 --> 09:17.088
<i>He made the loan.
He can unmake it.</i>

09:17.156 --> 09:19.886
You said it looked like
we didn't get a fair deal.

09:24.864 --> 09:27.264
Hello, Chief?

09:27.333 --> 09:31.394
Yeah. Uh, we were wondering
if we could talk to Mr. Vernon.

09:31.470 --> 09:33.404
I mean,
if that would be possible.

09:33.472 --> 09:37.875
Gus Vernon?
He's in Harker Falls.

09:37.944 --> 09:39.935
Need time to get him back here.

09:40.012 --> 09:42.810
Well, you better hurry up then.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.848
Nice talking to you again.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.912
Again?

09:52.858 --> 09:55.224
Billy.

09:55.294 --> 09:57.285
I want you to take
that motorcycle of yours...

09:57.363 --> 10:02.391
and go over to Harker Falls
and get Gus Vernon back here.

10:03.402 --> 10:07.168
Now go on.
Oh, Flo?

10:07.239 --> 10:11.198
Can you give me a piece of that
pecan pie? Oh, sure, Sheriff.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.303
<i>Look out. Get out of my way.!</i>

10:18.684 --> 10:20.652
What the hell's
going on, Chief?

10:20.720 --> 10:23.883
They say the-the Walters boys
are in the bank with hostages.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.447
Just relax, Carl.
We've got everything under control.

10:26.525 --> 10:30.825
Relax? My wife is in there. I wanna
know what you plan to do about this.

10:30.896 --> 10:35.162
Well, I plan on finishing my coffee
and having a piece of pie.

10:35.234 --> 10:38.692
Then I plan on
waiting for Gus Vernon.

10:38.771 --> 10:41.865
Wh-What about Cindy? I mean,
y-you gotta get her outta there.

10:41.941 --> 10:43.568
Thank you, Flo.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.339
That's all you're
gonna do then? Wait?

10:46.412 --> 10:50.212
That's all I can do. I suggest you go
on home and do the same thing, Carl.

10:50.282 --> 10:54.480
I don't believe this. What
kind of man are you anyway?

10:54.553 --> 10:57.249
A patient man.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.553
Go on now,
fore I lose it.

11:14.273 --> 11:17.333
<i>Why don't you boys take
those silly things off your faces?</i>

11:17.410 --> 11:20.038
<i>We all know who you are.</i>

11:31.057 --> 11:33.025
Why are you doing this?

11:33.092 --> 11:36.152
If you could just be patient a little bit
- Let me tell her.

11:36.228 --> 11:38.219
See these?

11:40.299 --> 11:43.234
That's what my father left
my brothers and me when he died.

11:44.236 --> 11:48.263
We get up before the sun,
and we don't rest till after dark.

11:49.975 --> 11:53.103
Then along comes Gus Vernon.

11:53.179 --> 11:56.205
He tells you you ain't gonna make it
unless you increase the yield.

11:57.283 --> 11:59.410
<i>Modernize, he says.</i>

12:01.353 --> 12:03.583
<i>Well, you're afraid oflosing
the only thing you got.</i>

12:03.656 --> 12:08.025
So you go along,
and you make the deal.

12:08.094 --> 12:13.088
But somehow, no matter how hard
you work, you can't keep up.

12:13.165 --> 12:15.929
Pretty soon you're selling off
milk cows to make the next payment.

12:17.803 --> 12:20.431
<i>It was just business. Well,
we'd like to hear Gus Vernon...</i>

12:20.506 --> 12:23.873
explain that kind of business
to us face-to-face.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.111
<i>Yeah, I'd love to hear that.</i>

12:32.184 --> 12:37.417
Sam, it turns out that the Walters farm was one of six
parcels bought at auction by an out-of-state developer...

12:37.490 --> 12:41.551
who went on to build the largest shopping
center in the whole tri-county area,

12:41.627 --> 12:44.187
and Vernon made
a fortune in kickbacks.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.788
He's forcing the farms under
so he can get the land?

12:46.866 --> 12:51.803
That's crazy. Don't sound crazy
to me. Sounds like a banker.

12:51.871 --> 12:55.637
<i>- What the hell you talking about?
- Sam, we should talk.</i>

12:55.708 --> 12:59.644
Look, I'll explain everything.
I just, uh-

12:59.712 --> 13:03.148
- I just need a minute.
- You got to go again?

13:03.215 --> 13:05.877
Yeah, I just need a second
to-to think.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.885
Uh-

13:07.953 --> 13:11.719
Uh, I'll be right back.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.193
Sam, I know that look.

13:24.703 --> 13:27.069
<i>What look? What
look? That look.</i>

13:27.139 --> 13:29.573
The "I'm gonna save the world" look.

13:29.642 --> 13:33.009
Ziggy says this leap's over
as soon as the brothers surrender.

13:33.078 --> 13:35.012
I can't do that.

13:35.080 --> 13:39.881
What do you mean you can't? Maybe I'm not making
myself clear here. I'm talking life and death here.

13:39.952 --> 13:42.887
So am I.
Don't you get it, Al?

13:44.089 --> 13:47.388
It doesn't matter if you kill a man
with a gun or with a pen.

13:47.459 --> 13:49.427
In the end,
he's still dead.

13:51.096 --> 13:55.692
I'm home, Al. And I'm
gonna stay right here.

14:06.245 --> 14:09.180
<i>Sam, this is not going
the way it's supposed to.</i>

14:09.248 --> 14:11.648
Don't tell me. Tell them.

14:11.717 --> 14:15.915
I know that you're sympathetic with the
situation here because it's your hometown...

14:15.988 --> 14:20.254
and all of that, but Ziggy
says there's a 73.9% chance...

14:20.326 --> 14:22.317
that if you surrender,
you'll leap.

14:22.394 --> 14:25.659
Leap? Why would I
want to leap? I'm home.

14:25.731 --> 14:27.562
But you're here
to save the brothers, right?

14:27.633 --> 14:31.729
So? You got to turn
yourself in. Right?

14:31.804 --> 14:35.433
So. Let's go.
Right?

14:35.507 --> 14:37.668
I can't.
Eh-

14:39.144 --> 14:41.772
How did I know
he was gonna say that?

14:41.847 --> 14:45.442
<i>I can't have been put here to save their
lives and then leave 'em with nothing, Al.</i>

14:45.517 --> 14:47.747
I mean,
their farm is all they got.

14:47.820 --> 14:50.050
<i>But Ziggy says-
Oh, forget about Ziggy.</i>

14:50.122 --> 14:52.113
Forget about Ziggy.

14:52.191 --> 14:54.125
Al.

14:56.328 --> 15:01.994
My dad worked our farm 16
hours a day, seven days a week.

15:02.067 --> 15:04.001
It was his life.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.162
And when-

15:06.238 --> 15:08.331
And when they took it
away from him-

15:11.043 --> 15:13.739
Well, it was wrong then,
and it's wrong now.

15:13.812 --> 15:16.838
Yeah, but you weren't
even there. Exactly.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.907
I wasn't... even there.

15:20.352 --> 15:25.119
Maybe I could have... helped him save what he
worked so hard to build, but I wasn't there.

15:26.392 --> 15:31.261
I've had to carry that around with me my whole life.
I don't want Willie to have to do the same thing.

15:31.330 --> 15:34.424
Okay. If you had it to do over again,
you'd do things differently.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.434
But it's a little
late, isn't it? Is it?

15:36.502 --> 15:38.493
See, that's what I'm thinking, Al.

15:38.570 --> 15:41.767
Maybe I've been put here
to have a second chance.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.774
A second chance?

15:43.842 --> 15:46.174
<i>Yeah. I mean,
it's pretty clear that...</i>

15:46.245 --> 15:49.112
<i>Vernon's motives,
not to mention his methods,</i>

15:49.181 --> 15:53.379
<i>are suspect, right?
So?</i>

15:53.452 --> 15:57.946
What if we can prove that Vernon manipulated
the loans? You said Neil wasn't on top of things.

15:58.023 --> 16:01.254
What if we can prove that he took
advantage of Neil and the others...

16:01.327 --> 16:03.295
to clear the way
for the shopping mall?

16:03.362 --> 16:05.330
Well, that would be awesome,

16:05.397 --> 16:09.060
except the mall won't be built
for another two years.

16:10.369 --> 16:14.169
Well, there's got to be some way we
can link him up with the deal, you know?

16:14.239 --> 16:18.437
L
- I just can't walk away again, Al. Okay.

16:18.510 --> 16:20.603
I've got to try.
Okay.

16:20.679 --> 16:24.672
I will go back and-and try and get
Ziggy to come up with something.

16:26.518 --> 16:28.509
Thanks.

16:30.522 --> 16:33.719
I better- I better
get back out there.

16:35.794 --> 16:37.989
Who knows, you know?
I mean, maybe, um-

16:38.063 --> 16:42.693
maybe if this all works out okay,
and I don't leap right away, um,

16:42.768 --> 16:45.168
maybe I could
go see my family.

16:53.412 --> 16:55.573
<i>Could I have your attention,
please?</i>

16:57.516 --> 17:01.316
I know this isn't exactly how you
planned on spending your holidays, but...

17:02.855 --> 17:06.415
I just want you to know
that my brothers and I...

17:06.492 --> 17:11.224
<i>have no intention
ofletting any of you get hurt.</i>

17:11.296 --> 17:15.596
<i>Mr. Vernon's on his way,
and hopefully we'll get everything settled,</i>

17:15.666 --> 17:19.103
<i>and we can all get back home
where we belong.</i>

17:19.171 --> 17:21.662
What do you-
What do you want me to do?

17:21.740 --> 17:24.675
Uh, you should keep an eye
on the front door.

17:24.742 --> 17:26.676
Right.
Hey!

17:26.744 --> 17:29.236
Stay away from the window.

17:32.217 --> 17:34.310
We shouldn't have
brought him.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.650
Why? He's got just as much
at stake as anybody else.

17:36.722 --> 17:40.954
Hey now, what was you saying before
about Vernon wanting our land?

17:41.026 --> 17:45.019
I think he knew that we could never make
those payments when he made us the loan.

17:45.097 --> 17:47.031
He set us up.

17:47.099 --> 17:50.364
You mean me, don't ya?
No. I didn't say that.

17:50.436 --> 17:52.427
Yeah.
You didn't have to.

18:09.988 --> 18:13.321
I don't mean to tell ya
how you do your bank robbin',

18:13.392 --> 18:18.830
but would you mind pointing that
peashooter you got in a different direction?

18:18.897 --> 18:21.923
Yeah. I'm-
I'm sorry, Mr. Pierce.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.695
Mr. Pierce.

18:23.769 --> 18:26.602
Mr. And Mrs. Pierce.

18:26.672 --> 18:31.473
You folks had that dairy farm
just a couple miles from-

18:35.747 --> 18:38.045
You've lived around here
for a long time, haven't ya?

18:38.117 --> 18:40.051
<i>54 years.</i>

18:40.119 --> 18:43.384
We moved here the year
after we got married.

18:46.558 --> 18:48.856
You've been married
55 years.

18:48.927 --> 18:50.952
That's great.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.125
Listen, uh,

18:58.437 --> 19:01.873
do you by any chance know,
uh, the Beckett family?

19:01.940 --> 19:03.931
John Beckett?
Oh, yeah.

19:04.009 --> 19:07.809
Everybody in this part of the county
knows John and Thelma Beckett.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.246
Fine family.

19:10.315 --> 19:13.478
One of their boys
just came back from Vietnam.

19:13.552 --> 19:15.577
Tom.

19:15.654 --> 19:18.282
Uh, his name is Tom.

19:18.357 --> 19:21.485
Um, when was the last time
you saw Mr. Beckett?

19:21.560 --> 19:23.528
Uh, let's see.

19:23.595 --> 19:28.931
I ran into him at Benning's
Hardware store just two days ago.

19:29.001 --> 19:33.165
How'd he look?
Same as usual.

19:33.238 --> 19:35.763
I remember one time,

19:35.841 --> 19:41.507
uh, Stan was away, and I took sick,
and John drove me to the doctor,

19:41.580 --> 19:44.606
waited over an hour,
and then he drove me home.

19:44.683 --> 19:47.743
He's a fine man.
Yes, he is.

19:47.819 --> 19:51.687
You know my sister.

19:51.757 --> 19:54.521
Mandy Greer?

19:54.593 --> 19:57.460
She was in your history class.

19:57.529 --> 20:00.862
You must remember.
She had long, red hair and braces.

20:02.434 --> 20:04.231
Patch over her right eye.

20:05.704 --> 20:08.070
Yeah. Yeah.

20:08.140 --> 20:10.700
<i>Sure. She was in the high
school production of Peter Pan.</i>

20:10.776 --> 20:12.971
She played Captain... Hook.

20:14.680 --> 20:18.047
Gee, that was a long time ago. How's
she doin'? She got her braces off.

20:18.116 --> 20:20.084
Oh.

20:20.152 --> 20:21.881
She still wears the patch.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.217
I see.

20:26.291 --> 20:28.225
Well-

20:30.362 --> 20:32.353
Oh.

20:33.799 --> 20:38.031
I'm really sorry that
you got mixed up in all of this.

20:38.103 --> 20:42.039
That's all right. My daddy
lost his place a while back.

20:42.107 --> 20:44.439
The way I see it,
Gus Vernon has it coming.

20:44.509 --> 20:46.443
Beth!
Well, he does.

20:46.511 --> 20:48.502
I don't know why you're
always protecting that man.

20:48.580 --> 20:52.539
Because he is our boss, that's why. We
wouldn't have a job if it wasn't for him.

20:52.618 --> 20:54.552
Oh. Some job.

20:54.620 --> 20:57.088
Two dollars an hour,
no benefits... and you.

20:57.155 --> 20:59.521
<i>I should've never
quit the Dairy Queen.</i>

20:59.591 --> 21:01.422
If you ask me,
that's where you belong.

21:01.493 --> 21:04.519
At least I don't have to sleep
with the boss to keep my job.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.860
- You little bitch.
- Takes one to know one.

21:06.932 --> 21:12.131
All-All-All right. Ladies,
please. Please. Just-

21:12.204 --> 21:14.764
Oh!

21:15.774 --> 21:17.833
You all right?
Baby's kickin'.

21:19.911 --> 21:25.110
You know, we don't need to keep you here
with us. We can just go ahead and let you go.

21:25.183 --> 21:28.175
Nobody's going anywhere!

21:28.253 --> 21:30.881
She's pregnant, okay?
That's why she's here.

21:30.956 --> 21:33.618
Mundy's not gonna make a move
as long as she stays here.

21:33.692 --> 21:37.685
If we let her go, he'll see we're willing
to deal. He'll also see that we're weak.

21:37.763 --> 21:41.358
You're losing sight of your objectives here.
Use your head. What is that supposed to mean?

21:41.433 --> 21:43.128
Willie! Vernon's here.

21:52.711 --> 21:54.804
<i>Look at him.</i>

21:54.880 --> 21:57.314
Crisp as a hundred dollar bill.

22:02.054 --> 22:06.821
- Excuse me.
- It was about time you got here.

22:06.892 --> 22:11.352
What the hell's going on, Clyde? One minute I'm doing
business, the next I hear my bank's being robbed.

22:11.430 --> 22:15.560
Well, first of all, your bank isn't
being robbed. It's being occupied.

22:15.634 --> 22:20.401
Secondly, it isn't your bank.
It belongs to the town.

22:20.472 --> 22:24.238
I didn't drive 30 miles
to get a lesson in semantics.

22:24.309 --> 22:26.675
Now, who's in there?

22:26.745 --> 22:29.111
Bill Walters's boys.
Who?

22:29.181 --> 22:31.149
Is it that easy to forget?

22:31.216 --> 22:35.482
Mary, what are you
doing here?

22:35.554 --> 22:38.182
There's a law against a mother
wanting to be near her children?

22:38.256 --> 22:40.190
What's this all about?

22:40.258 --> 22:43.386
- Murder.
- Murder?

22:43.462 --> 22:45.692
- Who's been murdered?
- A way of life.

22:45.764 --> 22:48.733
Mary, look.
We all know, uh,

22:48.800 --> 22:52.463
how hard it's been for you since you lost
Bill, but this isn't gonna bring him back.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.471
Now do your boys a favor.

22:56.007 --> 22:58.567
- Tell them to come on out.
- No, sir.

22:58.643 --> 23:02.204
- They are breaking the law.
- What would you know about the law?

23:03.181 --> 23:07.709
And you, Clyde Mundy, ought to
be ashamed siding with his type.

23:07.786 --> 23:10.084
I am trying to do my job.

23:10.155 --> 23:12.248
When does your job include
running with the devil?

23:12.324 --> 23:14.724
I don't have to listen to
this. Oh, you're gonna listen.

23:14.793 --> 23:17.762
We're not the first to go under here.

23:17.829 --> 23:20.229
<i>And we won't be the last.</i>

23:20.298 --> 23:26.100
Now, I was born in this county.
Most of these folk here were.

23:26.171 --> 23:30.232
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna
sit here and let the likes of you...

23:30.308 --> 23:32.970
<i>steal it out from under us.</i>

23:35.280 --> 23:37.475
No, sir.

23:37.549 --> 23:40.882
My boys stay right where they are.

23:40.952 --> 23:44.080
And they stay there with my blessing.

24:03.341 --> 24:05.434
Why the hell doesn't he call?

24:05.510 --> 24:08.445
- Just give him some time.
- You don't think they'll try anything funny?

24:08.513 --> 24:11.914
I say we fire off a couple rounds. Let
'em know we're still here. Give me this.

24:11.983 --> 24:14.247
Hey, give it back.
I'll give it to you later.

24:14.319 --> 24:16.310
Hey, I'm still
the oldest in this family.

24:16.388 --> 24:18.379
Then why don't you
start acting like it?

24:18.457 --> 24:20.925
You're so full of yourself,
aren't you?

24:20.992 --> 24:22.960
Big college boy.
Come home and fix everything.

24:23.028 --> 24:25.394
Neil, don't! Why not? Everyone
knows Willie's the smart one.

24:25.464 --> 24:29.230
Leave him outta this. What's it feel
like to know everything about everything?

24:29.301 --> 24:31.735
This isn't the time or the
place. Why, you going somewhere?

24:31.803 --> 24:33.737
Yeah. I'm gonna
let you cool off.

24:33.805 --> 24:36.501
Neil, come on. Oh,
that's it. Run away!

24:36.575 --> 24:38.566
You're good at that,
aren't you?

24:38.643 --> 24:42.875
I wonder if Pop might not still be alive
if you hadn't took off the way you did.

24:42.948 --> 24:45.576
That's enough.
That man lived for you.

24:45.650 --> 24:48.448
John and I were his sons,
but you were his life.

24:48.520 --> 24:51.148
And when he needed you
most, you weren't even there.

24:51.223 --> 24:53.157
I didn't know.

24:53.225 --> 24:55.659
Didn't know or didn't care.

24:57.496 --> 25:00.488
Don't ever say that again.

25:15.213 --> 25:20.241
<i>After only a few hours, it was obvious that
my life and Willie's had taken similar paths.</i>

25:20.318 --> 25:25.221
<i>It was also becoming clear that the
line separating us was beginning to blur.</i>

25:25.290 --> 25:29.420
<i>Still, I knew these people,
and it felt good. Thanks.</i>

25:29.494 --> 25:31.519
<i>It felt like... home.</i>

25:37.302 --> 25:41.033
<i>How ya doin'?
Okay.</i>

25:43.508 --> 25:47.308
Kind of a long day, huh?
Yeah.

25:55.220 --> 25:58.212
You scared?
What?

25:58.290 --> 26:00.758
Just want to know
if you're scared.

26:02.227 --> 26:05.958
No. Are you?

26:06.031 --> 26:07.658
Yeah. I'm scared.

26:10.135 --> 26:12.262
Look, I'm sorry
about what happened before.

26:12.337 --> 26:16.296
I shouldn't have hit him. You know, I just, uh
- I lost it.

26:16.374 --> 26:19.901
It?
My temper.

26:19.978 --> 26:24.415
This is all kind of sudden for me.
He- He didn't mean what he said.

26:24.482 --> 26:27.144
Well, sure sounded like it to me.

26:27.218 --> 26:30.745
It-It hasn't been easy for him
since Pop died.

26:37.228 --> 26:39.924
If I tell you something,

26:39.998 --> 26:42.626
will you promise not
to repeat it to anyone?

26:44.336 --> 26:46.327
Uh, sure.

26:49.441 --> 26:52.308
A few weeks ago
we were working on the tractor.

26:52.377 --> 26:56.108
All of a sudden, Neil hops off
and tells me to get in the truck.

26:56.181 --> 26:58.206
Next thing I know,
we're at Pop's grave.

26:59.684 --> 27:02.847
Must've spent two hours
just sittin' there.

27:02.921 --> 27:04.616
Just sittin' there.

27:05.690 --> 27:09.524
Yeah. Like- Like we were
waiting for something.

27:11.963 --> 27:16.161
All of a sudden,
Neil starts talkin' about you.

27:18.036 --> 27:22.530
'Bout- 'Bout-'Bout
how much he admired you.

27:22.607 --> 27:25.337
How proud he was that you
were making something of yourself.

27:25.410 --> 27:31.315
And he said, uh, that you were too
smart to get trapped like he did.

27:31.383 --> 27:36.150
That life was too short
to spend it miserable...

27:36.221 --> 27:38.212
and full of regret.

27:44.129 --> 27:46.120
And...

27:48.366 --> 27:50.357
then he-

27:50.435 --> 27:52.426
he cried.

28:00.078 --> 28:02.239
Sam?

28:04.449 --> 28:08.545
Look, I'm gonna go
stretch my legs.

28:08.620 --> 28:11.214
Can I get you something?
You need anything?

28:13.958 --> 28:15.892
Kathy Campbell's phone number.

28:20.298 --> 28:22.391
Willie?

28:22.467 --> 28:24.458
I lied.

28:26.204 --> 28:28.536
I am scared.

28:43.788 --> 28:45.949
Seems pretty calm
out there right now.

28:46.024 --> 28:49.289
Yeah. Like right before a tornado.
Did Ziggy come up with anything?

28:49.360 --> 28:54.320
Uh, well, there was nothing ever officially
registered between Vernon and the developer.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.697
Nada.
He's too smart for that.

28:56.768 --> 29:01.535
Yeah. And if there's anything linking him to the
deal, he's keeping it pretty close to the vest.

29:01.606 --> 29:04.769
You think maybe
in his house, or-

29:04.843 --> 29:06.777
Well, you might
find something there. Yeah.

29:06.845 --> 29:09.814
All right. I got to get
out of here then. Now wait.

29:09.881 --> 29:14.318
There's a deputy guarding the back entrance,
but Ziggy's been running some escape scenarios.

29:14.385 --> 29:18.412
She says your best shot
is to create some kind of diversion.

29:18.490 --> 29:21.357
Diversion?
Al, take a look around.

29:21.426 --> 29:24.486
I'm stuck in this bank. How
am I gonna create a diversion?

29:27.732 --> 29:29.859
Are you gonna be much longer?

29:33.838 --> 29:37.330
Let me get this straight.
You want me to go out the door,

29:37.408 --> 29:40.809
and when I get in the middle
of the street, pretend to go into labor?

29:40.879 --> 29:43.814
That's right.

29:43.882 --> 29:45.816
<i>Doesn't sound too difficult.
Wait a second.!</i>

29:45.884 --> 29:47.977
You're not really going to do this?

29:49.454 --> 29:51.445
You sure that Vernon's guilty?
Positive.

29:51.523 --> 29:53.821
It's just gonna take more
than my word to prove it.

29:53.892 --> 29:57.157
Don't you see what he's doing?
He's just trying to use you to get away.

29:57.228 --> 30:00.994
<i>Don't be stupid.
This really bothers you, doesn't it?</i>

30:01.065 --> 30:03.829
Yes!
When do we go?

30:07.739 --> 30:09.900
<i>Don't shoot.! I'm coming out.!</i>

30:22.086 --> 30:24.077
<i>Come on, Beth.</i>

30:27.425 --> 30:29.586
<i>It's all right, hon.
Come on.</i>

30:34.966 --> 30:36.900
<i>Now, Beth?</i>

30:36.968 --> 30:40.961
- Come on across the street, hon.
- Okay, baby.

30:41.039 --> 30:43.030
Showtime.

30:44.275 --> 30:46.266
Come on.
Come on, honey.

30:48.313 --> 30:50.440
Ow!

31:02.927 --> 31:05.054
What's she doing?
I think she's gonna have a baby.

31:05.129 --> 31:08.758
<i>My baby.! My baby.!
Come on. Come on, come on.</i>

31:08.833 --> 31:10.892
<i>Well, go. Go, go, go!</i>

31:12.036 --> 31:14.231
<i>Okay, Sam. He's gone.
Ow, ow, ow.!</i>

31:14.305 --> 31:16.296
What now? What now?
Get out of here.

31:16.374 --> 31:19.036
Go down the alley, turn
around the corner, go north.

31:19.110 --> 31:22.102
Vernon's house is about a
mile out of town. Hurry up!

31:29.988 --> 31:31.979
<i>I'm okay. I'll be okay.</i>

31:51.209 --> 31:53.837
Do you think
he got away?

31:53.912 --> 31:56.176
How the hell should I know?

31:56.247 --> 31:58.408
I didn't hear any gunshots.

31:58.483 --> 32:00.974
Well, I don't want
to hear anymore talk!

32:07.625 --> 32:10.958
Everything's gonna be all right.

32:19.871 --> 32:22.806
<i>Come on, Sam. Hurry up.</i>

32:22.874 --> 32:25.308
Sam, hurry up!
Come on! Hurry up!

32:25.376 --> 32:28.140
Hurry up. It's not far.
It's just another hundred yards or so.

32:28.212 --> 32:30.271
You can almost see it
right down the road.

32:30.348 --> 32:32.282
Come on.
I'm out of shape, Al.

32:32.350 --> 32:37.686
Next leap, maybe you'll leap into Carl Lewis. Right now
you gotta suck it up. Now come on. You gonna make it?

32:37.755 --> 32:40.189
I don't have much left.
How far-

32:41.259 --> 32:43.193
<i>Churchdale Road.</i>

32:43.261 --> 32:47.220
I remember this place.
My-

32:48.299 --> 32:50.290
My folks' farm-

32:50.368 --> 32:52.836
It's just, uh,
10 miles down that road.

32:57.141 --> 33:00.804
Well, nobody could blame ya
if you kept going.

33:00.878 --> 33:03.039
What about Neil and John?

33:04.415 --> 33:08.010
What about all the other families
Vernon's taken advantage of?

33:09.020 --> 33:11.011
You think they'd understand?

33:11.089 --> 33:14.525
Well, I-
I didn't say it'd be easy.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.652
Need a lift, fella?

33:20.765 --> 33:22.756
No thanks.

33:33.444 --> 33:35.776
<i>Sam, look out for that-</i>

33:36.781 --> 33:39.944
that, uh, pile
of newspapers.

33:40.018 --> 33:44.114
That was smooth, Sam. I hope you
never leap in as a cat burglar.

33:47.692 --> 33:51.093
Wow. Looks like the housekeeper
took the year off here.

33:51.162 --> 33:56.099
Yeah. Vernon probably repossessed
her cleaning equipment or something.

33:56.167 --> 33:58.863
Did you know this Vernon
when you were here before?

33:58.936 --> 34:04.306
Uh, well, he was a couple years
ahead of my brother in high school.

34:04.375 --> 34:08.311
He ran for class president, I think.
Did he win?

34:08.379 --> 34:11.109
Uh, no. As I remember,
he was disqualified.

34:11.181 --> 34:14.514
Something about stuffing
the ballot box or something.

34:14.585 --> 34:18.146
Oh, he was stuffing the ballot
box. Well, at least he's consistent.

34:18.222 --> 34:20.156
What are we
looking for?

34:20.224 --> 34:22.317
Someplace you would
hide valuables, you know?

34:22.393 --> 34:26.693
A- A safe. A wall safe.
A filing cabinet or some drawers-

34:26.764 --> 34:29.597
A strongbox with
a lock the size of Maine?

34:43.114 --> 34:47.551
Okay, uh
- A letter opener or a file or something.

34:47.618 --> 34:49.609
<i>How about the key?</i>

35:00.431 --> 35:04.492
<i>I'll, uh, take the gun, please.</i>

35:08.806 --> 35:12.503
Careful.

35:12.577 --> 35:14.670
What are you doing here?

35:15.680 --> 35:18.774
You haven't changed since
high school, have you, Gus?

35:18.850 --> 35:22.445
High school? What do you know about
what I was like in high school?

35:22.520 --> 35:25.284
Why'd you do it? How could you
steal all those people's land?

35:25.356 --> 35:28.655
What you call stealing,
I call business.

35:28.726 --> 35:31.991
I guess that makes it a little
easier to sleep at night.

35:32.063 --> 35:34.531
I saw an opportunity,
so I took it.

35:34.599 --> 35:39.468
What a nozzle! I'd like to grab his Adam's
apple and pull it out through his nostrils.

35:39.537 --> 35:42.631
Most of the farms were so far under,
they couldn't see the light of day.

35:42.707 --> 35:46.905
So you put them out of their misery? Nobody
forced anyone to do anything he didn't want to do.

35:46.978 --> 35:51.677
You intimidated them, and then you stole their lives
out from under them, all so you could turn a profit.

35:51.749 --> 35:54.081
Yeah? Well, you can't
prove that, can you?

35:56.888 --> 35:59.686
No, I can't.

36:01.759 --> 36:04.250
But I'll bet there's
plenty of proof in here.

36:07.598 --> 36:09.532
You're crazy.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.864
Am I? Why don't we
open this and find out?

36:11.936 --> 36:15.428
No, I don't think so. I'll tell
you what I am gonna do though.

36:15.506 --> 36:21.445
I'm gonna call Chief Mundy and tell
him... that I just killed me an intruder.

36:25.216 --> 36:27.207
I was wrong.

36:29.287 --> 36:31.847
You have changed.

36:31.923 --> 36:34.721
What are you doing?
Sam, what are you doing?

36:34.792 --> 36:38.159
Go ahead, shoot me in the back.
It's more your style, isn't it?

36:38.229 --> 36:41.221
No. I wouldn't do that, Sam.
It's not a good idea. You know,

36:41.299 --> 36:44.564
you made a big mistake
coming back home.

36:45.570 --> 36:47.936
You should've stayed away.

36:48.005 --> 36:49.939
That makes two of us.

36:50.007 --> 36:52.942
Ow!

37:10.661 --> 37:13.221
What, what, what?
What is it?

37:15.633 --> 37:18.534
What is it? A letter of
intent from the developer.

37:18.603 --> 37:21.128
Ah, bingo!

37:21.205 --> 37:27.166
All you have to do now is get that back to Mundy, so
we can get this over with. Right. I'm all for that.

37:30.147 --> 37:32.081
You didn't see anything else?

37:32.149 --> 37:35.141
All I remember is turning around
and seeing Carl Wilkens.

37:35.219 --> 37:38.017
Next thing you know,
shots are fired inside the bank.

37:38.089 --> 37:40.148
What if he shot
one of my boys?

37:40.224 --> 37:42.215
Clyde, you've got
to do something.

37:42.293 --> 37:44.227
<i>What's that?</i>

37:44.295 --> 37:46.263
<i>Who's that there?</i>

37:52.036 --> 37:55.164
<i>Willie.
Willie?</i>

37:55.239 --> 37:57.503
<i>You keep Mary here.</i>

37:57.575 --> 38:00.635
Hold it right there, Willie.

38:00.711 --> 38:02.702
Drop the gun.

38:02.780 --> 38:04.771
Right now.

38:10.521 --> 38:13.649
Chief, this isn't necessary.
Humor me.

38:13.724 --> 38:19.128
Look, I have evidence that Gus Vernon manipulated,
intentionally, the farm loans in order to sell off the land.

38:20.197 --> 38:24.463
Is he?
Oh, no. He's just resting.

38:24.535 --> 38:26.628
I want you to look
at this. What is it?

38:26.704 --> 38:31.835
It's an agreement between Gus Vernon and a
private developer to build on the foreclosed land.

38:31.909 --> 38:34.969
And it was signed six months
before the first farm went under.

38:35.046 --> 38:38.482
Where'd you get this?
Vernon's house.

38:38.549 --> 38:42.178
Looks like you've got enough here to put
Gus away for a long while. That's great.

38:42.253 --> 38:45.654
Let me tell my brothers. We can end
this. We've got a bigger problem now.

38:45.723 --> 38:47.554
There's been a shooting.
What?

38:47.625 --> 38:50.492
Carl Wilkens decided to take
the law into his own hands,

38:50.561 --> 38:52.654
busted into the bank
and there were shots fired.

38:52.730 --> 38:56.029
Sam, no, it's John.
He's been shot.

38:56.100 --> 38:58.068
<i>He's hurt bad.
You better get in there quick.</i>

38:58.135 --> 39:02.435
Sheriff, I've got to go talk to my brother.
We've been tryin' to, but they don't answer.

39:02.506 --> 39:06.670
<i>- The state boys are gettin'ready to go in.
- You've got to get in there. Hurry up!</i>

39:06.744 --> 39:10.703
If you let me talk to them, I can
get them to come out. I don't know.

39:10.781 --> 39:13.614
You said yourself that might be
enough evidence to convict Vernon.

39:13.684 --> 39:17.120
Now let me go tell Neil. He doesn't
want to hurt anybody. Please, Chief?

39:17.188 --> 39:20.419
Please.
What do you got to lose?

39:21.459 --> 39:25.088
All right. Five minutes,
or they'll start moving in.

39:25.162 --> 39:27.062
Go! Go!

39:34.372 --> 39:36.840
You.
You killed him.

39:41.445 --> 39:44.573
This is all your fault.

39:44.648 --> 39:47.742
He wasn't gonna hurt anybody.
He's just a kid.

39:47.818 --> 39:49.809
<i>No!
Neil?</i>

39:49.887 --> 39:52.947
<i>Please, no.!
It's me.</i>

39:54.058 --> 39:55.992
Don't shoot.
It's just-

39:56.060 --> 39:58.494
It's just me.

39:58.562 --> 40:01.827
Willie.
Yeah.

40:01.899 --> 40:04.231
I didn't think
you were coming back.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.831
I really messed up
this time, didn't I?

40:11.909 --> 40:14.571
It's okay.

40:16.213 --> 40:18.704
We're gonna take care
of everything, all right?

40:26.557 --> 40:28.491
He's alive.

40:29.894 --> 40:34.024
- We have to get him to the hospital.
- I didn't mean for this to happen.

40:34.098 --> 40:36.965
<i>He came out of nowhere.
I thought he was gonna kill John.</i>

40:37.034 --> 40:42.165
<i>John. Oh, my God.
What did I do?</i>

40:42.239 --> 40:46.300
- Neil, this has gotta end.
- Well, what about Vernon? We can't let him get away!

40:46.377 --> 40:50.939
He's not gonna get away. I got the proof
that we needed to get the loan reviewed.

40:51.015 --> 40:54.473
You're gonna get the farm back, but there
are people waiting for us to come out first.

40:57.054 --> 40:59.147
You did it, didn't you?

41:01.358 --> 41:03.349
You saved us again.

41:07.398 --> 41:09.457
Pop would be so proud.

41:14.071 --> 41:17.837
God, what a disappointment
I must have been.

41:17.908 --> 41:20.604
L- I never could be what he wanted.

41:20.678 --> 41:22.805
I never could be you.

41:25.182 --> 41:27.742
Neil, it's all right.

41:27.818 --> 41:30.446
I tried to do the right things.

41:30.521 --> 41:33.149
I never wanted to be
head of the family.

41:34.825 --> 41:38.226
I've ruined... everything he built.

41:38.295 --> 41:42.823
You did your best.
How? By losing a farm?

41:42.900 --> 41:44.959
No.

41:45.035 --> 41:47.196
By being there
when he needed you.

41:47.271 --> 41:49.865
Don't you see?

41:51.442 --> 41:53.376
In the end,

41:54.378 --> 41:56.369
it wasn't my face he saw.

41:56.447 --> 41:58.438
It was yours.

41:59.783 --> 42:04.618
And no matter what happens to me, no
matter what I do for the rest of my life,

42:06.357 --> 42:08.518
I can never change that.

42:09.593 --> 42:11.584
That moment belongs to you.

42:13.998 --> 42:16.728
I loved that old man.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.362
I should've told him.

42:27.811 --> 42:29.745
You just did.

42:31.215 --> 42:34.150
Now come on.

42:34.218 --> 42:36.550
Let's get him out of here.

42:57.074 --> 42:59.065
Is he gonna be okay?

42:59.143 --> 43:03.477
Oh, sure. Yeah, he and Wilkens
are both gonna be just fine.

43:03.547 --> 43:07.381
<i>Vernon? Uh, Vernon is
convicted ofbank fraud,</i>

43:07.451 --> 43:11.182
<i>and he serves six months
and gets his license revoked.</i>

43:11.255 --> 43:15.817
And here's the good part. The state banking
commission reviews the loans that he made,

43:15.893 --> 43:18.259
and then they rescind
the foreclosure proceedings.

43:18.329 --> 43:20.320
<i>What about the brothers?</i>

43:20.397 --> 43:24.333
<i>John and Willie
are convicted of illegal entry,</i>

43:24.401 --> 43:28.269
<i>but thejudge takes things into consideration,
and he lets them off with probation.</i>

43:28.339 --> 43:30.273
<i>Uh, Neil is convicted...</i>

43:30.341 --> 43:34.437
of aggravated assault,
so he serves a term of five years.

43:34.511 --> 43:39.539
Then after he's released, he just drifts
around the country doing odd jobs...

43:39.617 --> 43:43.109
until, uh-
"Until, uh," what?

43:43.187 --> 43:48.420
Until he's-he's shot in an alley
in New Orleans in '77.

43:49.426 --> 43:51.951
It's a robbery,
and he gets killed.

43:54.965 --> 43:59.527
Are you saying that I leaped in here and
saved his life just so he could be murdered?

43:59.603 --> 44:03.164
Well, Sam, they
- they can't all be happy endings.

44:03.240 --> 44:05.231
And there's nothing I can do?

44:05.309 --> 44:08.301
Well, if you want to hang around
here for another six years-

44:08.379 --> 44:12.179
I wish I never would have stopped. Why
should I even stop? I should just keep going.

44:12.249 --> 44:14.945
It's-It's just like you're leaping
around in time fixing things.

44:15.019 --> 44:17.214
It-It's just supposed to be.

44:17.287 --> 44:19.448
I just wish this whole thing
never would-

44:20.457 --> 44:22.448
Okay, John.

44:23.460 --> 44:25.360
Dad.
Sam.

44:26.997 --> 44:28.988
<i>Sam.!</i>

44:29.066 --> 44:30.931
Dad?

44:31.001 --> 44:33.060
Dad, wait a minute. Wai-

44:34.938 --> 44:37.270
You're real.

44:37.341 --> 44:41.744
You're alive,
and you're real.

44:41.812 --> 44:44.042
Well, I believe that's true.

44:44.114 --> 44:46.048
Uh, do I know you?

44:48.118 --> 44:50.052
Know me?
Of course, you know me.

44:50.120 --> 44:52.054
<i>I'm your so-
No, no, Sam.!</i>

44:52.122 --> 44:54.590
No, he can't see you.
All he can see is Willie.

44:58.262 --> 45:00.196
I'm Willie Walters.

45:00.264 --> 45:03.722
Bill Walters's boy?
That's right.

45:03.801 --> 45:07.601
I haven't seen you
since the funeral.

45:07.671 --> 45:10.299
Your father was a good man.
He was the best.

45:10.374 --> 45:12.569
How's your mother?
She's good.

45:12.643 --> 45:15.976
She wanted me to give you
a message though. Message?

45:17.481 --> 45:20.416
Yeah, she, uh-

45:21.719 --> 45:24.779
she wanted me
to wish you a merry Christmas.

45:26.356 --> 45:28.347
Well,

45:28.425 --> 45:30.552
Merry Christmas to you too, son.

45:30.627 --> 45:32.618
Merry Christmas to you.

45:46.477 --> 45:48.775
<i>Dad.!
Daddy.! Daddy, you're here.!</i>

45:48.846 --> 45:52.111
Dad, you're home!
Well, it's about time.

45:52.182 --> 45:56.243
<i>Arriving passenger Martin Elroy,
please report to the courtesy desk.</i>

45:56.320 --> 45:58.447
- Martin Elroy.
- What's that about?

45:58.522 --> 46:00.956
What's what about?
They just paged you.

46:01.024 --> 46:05.620
Oh. Well, I guess I was so excited
to see everybody, I didn't hear.

46:05.696 --> 46:09.894
Well, we'll get your bags and meet you
at the curb. But don't take too long.

46:09.967 --> 46:14.233
I've got a pot roast in the oven
and something special for dessert.

46:15.239 --> 46:17.571
Come on.
Welcome, Daddy.

46:26.250 --> 46:28.241
Hi.
Just a moment, please.

46:28.318 --> 46:30.912
You, uh- Huh?

46:35.225 --> 46:37.216
Kids?

46:37.294 --> 46:39.728
It's my turn.
Here he is now!

46:39.797 --> 46:42.891
Oh, Daddy!
Oh, I missed you, Daddy.

46:42.966 --> 46:46.060
<i>Surprise.!
I missed you, Daddy.</i>

46:46.136 --> 46:48.127
Oh, boy.
