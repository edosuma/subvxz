OLIVER:
My name is Oliver Queen.

00:05.240 --> 00:07.846
After five years on a hellish island...

00:08.039 --> 00:10.520
I have come home with only one goal:

00:11.040 --> 00:12.929
To save my city.

00:13.120 --> 00:16.408
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

00:18.280 --> 00:22.285
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

00:23.200 --> 00:25.806
I must be something else.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.291
Previously on Arrow:

00:29.440 --> 00:31.807
Blood's trounced every
potential candidate we focus tested.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.724
You want me to run against Blood?

00:33.920 --> 00:38.926
- Child of Ra's Al Ghul awaits your return.
- Tell Ra's Al Ghul my family's off limits.

00:39.120 --> 00:41.282
- It's time for you to come back home.
- I can't.

00:41.480 --> 00:43.687
If they knew I was alive, Laurel and Mom...

00:43.880 --> 00:47.851
they would never stop looking for me
and that could get them both killed.

00:48.040 --> 00:51.522

enough is enough.

Welcome to Starling City...

02:29.520 --> 02:33.491
A successful mayoral campaign
isn't about polling, fundraising...

02:33.680 --> 02:36.411
or hot-button issues,
it's about connecting with people.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.329
After we announce tomorrow, Moira...

02:38.520 --> 02:41.330
I want you in front of
as many cameras as possible.

02:41.520 --> 02:44.490
- Morning shows, talk shows...
- I want to help rebuild the city...

02:44.720 --> 02:47.929
- not pander to it.
- It's not pandering, it's campaigning.

the real Moira Queen...

02:50.240 --> 02:53.323

03:01.680 --> 03:03.808
Mr. Steele, may I talk
to you about something?

03:03.960 --> 03:07.328
I'm no longer your boss, Felicity.
Let's make it Walter from now on.

03:07.520 --> 03:11.161
Okay. Walter. It's about Tempest.

03:12.320 --> 03:16.166
Mrs. Queen's super sketchy offshore LLC
you asked me to look into last year.

03:16.360 --> 03:17.646
I remember.

03:18.960 --> 03:20.121
That's right.

03:20.320 --> 03:23.688
So, the thing is, I left an
embedded account alert on it...

03:23.880 --> 03:26.645
so we'd know
if anyone ever accessed it again.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.810
A few days ago there was a wire transfer
made from Tempest...

03:30.000 --> 03:32.367
to a numbered account
at Starling National Bank.

03:32.600 --> 03:35.126
Probably the campaign

03:35.360 --> 03:37.169
Or it could be something else.

That is the money she used
to do really bad things.

for pretty good reasons...

03:44.000 --> 03:46.207

- What happened to her eye?
- Minor subconjunctival hemorrhaging.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.800
Probably from hitting her head

When I mentioned it to Walter,
he told me he'd talk to you about it.

I could tell on his face he wouldn't.
British people are really bad liars.

12:13.760 --> 12:17.606

- So I looked into it myself because...

12:18.040 --> 12:21.249
full disclosure? I don't trust you.

12:22.040 --> 12:25.408
You paid a substantial
sum of money to a Dr. Gill.

12:25.600 --> 12:28.683
He delivered Thea.
Which didn't make any sense to me.

until I remembered...

12:32.120 --> 12:33.963

12:34.160 --> 12:37.687
You had an affair with Malcolm Merlyn.

12:37.880 --> 12:40.531
One year before Thea was born.

12:42.920 --> 12:44.729
Merlyn is Thea's father.

12:45.560 --> 12:51.044
I can see why Walter and Oliver have
such a high appraisal of your capabilities.

12:51.920 --> 12:55.641
So, what are you going to do
with this information...

12:57.920 --> 12:59.445
Felicity?

13:01.360 --> 13:05.922
I don't know. Confronting you
was as far as my plan went.

13:09.760 --> 13:13.651
I thought you deserved
the chance to tell Oliver yourself.

13:13.840 --> 13:15.285
He should hear it from you.

13:15.520 --> 13:19.445
I'm not going to tell my son anything.
And neither are you.

13:20.480 --> 13:23.609
If you won't keep
my secret for Oliver's sake...

13:23.800 --> 13:25.689
you should keep it for your own.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.241
I see the way you look at him.

13:29.880 --> 13:34.169
You tell him this,
you will rip his world apart.

13:34.360 --> 13:37.011
And a part of him will always blame you.

13:37.200 --> 13:40.010
He'll hate me, for sure.

13:40.760 --> 13:42.728
But he will hate you too.

13:43.560 --> 13:47.565
We all have to keep secrets, Miss Smoak.

And so they are.

Now come home.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.929
I can't. I can't go back, Nyssa.

14:22.120 --> 14:24.122
I don't have much of a soul left in me...

14:24.320 --> 14:27.085
but what there is,
it can't take the killing anymore.

sent me here to make sure you honor it...

14:32.960 --> 14:34.769
one way or another.

14:37.280 --> 14:40.250
We both know the real reason
why you came here.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.448
When I found you...

14:49.040 --> 14:53.762
you were starving and alone,
simply waiting to die.

14:55.880 --> 14:57.928
The League took you in...

14:58.880 --> 15:00.530
nursed you back to health.

15:01.120 --> 15:04.169
The only reason you're alive today
is because of me.

15:04.840 --> 15:08.845
Hey, I wasn't with you
because you saved me...

15:09.800 --> 15:13.327
I was with you because I loved you.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.367
But not anymore.

15:25.440 --> 15:29.490
Ra's listens to you
and you could ask him to release me.

15:29.680 --> 15:32.411
My father has never
released anyone from the League.

15:32.600 --> 15:33.886
He released Malcolm Merlyn.

15:34.080 --> 15:37.687
An action he and the citizens
of this city dearly regret.
