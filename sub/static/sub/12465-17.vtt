HEY, WILLOW.

00:12.279 --> 00:14.413

00:14.415 --> 00:16.715
NOPE. CATCHING JOEYS.

00:17.818 --> 00:20.519
AND WHEN I NAB HIM,
I'M ASKING HIM TO PROM.

00:20.521 --> 00:23.355
OKAY, BUT IF YOU
CATCH HIM IN A NET,

00:23.357 --> 00:26.225
ISN'T THAT REALLY, LIKE,
NOT ASKING HIM?

00:26.961 --> 00:29.762
WE HAVE A COMPLICATED
RELATIONSHIP.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.298
SO, UH, WHO ARE YOU
GOING WITH?

00:33.300 --> 00:34.733
MY MICROPHONE.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.301
I'M PERFORMING A SONG
AT PROM, SO...

00:36.303 --> 00:37.970
NO WAY!
THAT'S SO COOL!

00:37.972 --> 00:39.671
THANK YOU. YEAH.
I'M STILL WRITING IT, THOUGH,

00:39.673 --> 00:41.607
SO I JUST FEEL LIKE HAVING
A DATE WOULD BE A DISTRACTION.

00:41.609 --> 00:43.308
I GOT YOU, JOEY!

00:44.945 --> 00:46.578
SORRY, JEFFREY.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.447
MOVE ALONG.

00:48.449 --> 00:51.350
OKAY, WILLOW...

00:51.352 --> 00:53.352
WILLOW.

00:53.354 --> 00:55.654
YOU CAN'T JUST
THROW A NET AROUND

00:55.656 --> 00:58.424
AND EXPECT TO
CATCH A GUY YOU LIKE.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.061
NICE WELCOME FOR
THE NEW KID.

01:02.063 --> 01:03.929

SUPER-CUTE NEIGHBOR

01:06.267 --> 01:07.733

SCHOOL.

01:07.735 --> 01:10.019

HE'S SUPER CUTE?

01:10.020 --> 01:12.304
BECAUSE IF I DIDN'T, YOU SHOULD
KNOW THAT HE'S SUPER CUTE.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.506

01:25.719 --> 01:28.520

01:28.522 --> 01:32.024
OH, WELL, MY BOARDING SCHOOL WAS

01:32.026 --> 01:33.992
WHICH IS NOW A NEW
SINKHOLE.

01:35.496 --> 01:37.329
WITH A BOARDING SCHOOL IN IT.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.165

03:10.124 --> 03:12.491
IT'S ABOUT OUR SWAN BOAT.

03:12.493 --> 03:15.928
I HAVE NO INTEREST
IN THAT WORTHLESS PIECE
OF WHIMSICAL PINE.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.797
LAST NEW YEAR'S,
PARKER AND I

03:18.799 --> 03:22.034
GOT OUR VERY OWN
SWAN BOAT.

03:22.036 --> 03:23.869
BUT IT WAS WINTER,

03:23.871 --> 03:25.571
SO INSTEAD OF THIS...

03:25.573 --> 03:28.707
WE GOT THIS.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.676
LOST A TOE THAT NIGHT.

03:30.678 --> 03:31.810
DOWN TO TEN,

03:31.812 --> 03:34.580
JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

03:34.582 --> 03:35.981
NO, HEAR ME OUT.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.016
WE SOUP-UP SWANNY WITH
TIRES AND AN ENGINE,

03:38.018 --> 03:41.620
AND WE'LL HAVE AN AMPHIBIOUS
SWAN BOAT FOR ALL SEASONS.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.488
HONK IF YOU LOVE SWAN BOATS.

03:43.490 --> 03:45.424
HONK! HONK!

03:47.061 --> 03:49.695
DID YOU JUST LEAVE ME HANGING
WITH A SOLO HONK?

03:49.697 --> 03:52.064
I'M SORRY, PARKER.

03:52.066 --> 03:54.066
I JUST CAN'T LOOK AT
THE SWAN BOAT ANYMORE.

03:54.068 --> 03:55.667
THE DAY THE PEDALS BROKE OFF

03:55.669 --> 03:57.436
AND WE HAD TO USE
MY UNDERPANTS AS A SAIL,

03:57.438 --> 03:59.838
THE DREAM DIED.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.674
I'M JUST NOT A HONK MAN
ANYMORE, BUD.

04:04.845 --> 04:08.013
MARK MY WORDS,
YOU WILL HONK AGAIN!

04:10.184 --> 04:13.018
MOM, JOEY WON'T
HONK WITH ME!

04:14.955 --> 04:16.522
PUT A PIN IN IT, PARKER.

04:16.523 --> 04:18.090
I AM HELPING MADDIE PICK OUT
HER PROM DRESS.

04:18.092 --> 04:20.492
MOM, I'M NOT GOING
TO PROM.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.728
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T GO
WITHOUT A DATE,

04:22.730 --> 04:24.430
AND DIGGIE'S IN TUNDRABANIA,

04:24.431 --> 04:26.131
AND IT'S NOT LIKE I'M GONNA GO
WITH ANYONE ELSE AT OUR SCHOOL.

04:26.133 --> 04:27.833
WELL...

04:27.835 --> 04:30.636
MOMMA FOUND A WAY
FOR YOU TO GO.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.138
I GET IT.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.140
TIME TO LINT-ROLL
MY TUX.

04:36.977 --> 04:41.046
ACTUALLY, I INVITED
COUSIN CRAIG TO BE YOUR DATE.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.047
YOU DID WHAT?

04:42.049 --> 04:43.949
OKAY, NO.

04:43.951 --> 04:47.653
MOM, THERE IS NO WAY
THAT I'M GOING TO THE PROM
WITH CRUSTY CRAIG.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.722
WHY DO YOU CALL HIM
CRUSTY CRAIG?

04:50.724 --> 04:53.125
DOES IT MATTER?

04:53.126 --> 04:55.527
DO YOU THINK
THERE'S A GOOD REASON
TO BE CALLED CRUSTY?

04:57.031 --> 04:58.497
MADDIE, THERE IS NO WAY

04:58.498 --> 04:59.964
THAT I AM LETTING MY DAUGHTER
MISS HER PROM.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.851
-BUT, MOM--
-NO BUTS!

05:02.852 --> 05:05.736
CRUSTY--CRAIG IS COMING ALL
THE WAY FROM MUNCIE, INDIANA.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.539
I AM YOUR MOTHER,
YOU ARE GOING,

05:07.541 --> 05:08.974
AND THAT IS THAT!

05:08.976 --> 05:11.076
NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT
THESE DRESSES.

05:13.714 --> 05:16.114
WELL, THE BLUE WORKS
WITH HER SKIN TONE,

05:16.116 --> 05:17.149
BUT I'D WEAR
A WRAP WITH IT.

05:17.151 --> 05:18.717
SOMETHING UNDERSTATED.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.889
I LIVE WITH TOO MANY GIRLS.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.027
HEY, LIV.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.996
THANKS FOR SHOWING ME
AROUND YESTERDAY.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.031
OH. YEAH.
(chuckles)

05:33.033 --> 05:36.001
I MEAN, ONCE YOU KNOW
WHICH WATER FOUNTAINS
SPRAY UP YOUR NOSE,

05:36.003 --> 05:37.269
RIDGEWOOD'S PRETTY
MUCH A CAKEWALK.

05:37.271 --> 05:39.705
A FRIENDLY FACE
DOESN'T HURT, EITHER.

05:39.707 --> 05:41.840
(grunting)

05:41.842 --> 05:43.508
ART SCULPTURE
COMING THROUGH!

05:43.510 --> 05:45.277
(grunting)

05:45.279 --> 05:46.978
HEY!

05:46.980 --> 05:48.980
ANDIE, THIS IS HOLDEN.
HE IS SUPER CU--

05:48.982 --> 05:50.782
HE'S NEW.
HE'S SUPER NEW HERE.

05:52.019 --> 05:55.187
YOUR ART PROJECT REMINDS ME
OF A SEBASTIAN OLIVER SCULPTURE.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.989
THANKS!
OLIVER'S MY FAVORITE.

05:57.991 --> 06:00.192
SERIOUSLY?
MINE, TOO.

06:00.194 --> 06:03.161
HEY, YOU SHOULD HELP US OUT ON
THE PROM DECORATING COMMITTEE.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.297
COME ON, HOLDEN.

06:05.299 --> 06:07.966

YOUR NEW SCHOOL.

06:07.968 --> 06:11.002

GET INVOLVED WITH ME.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.204
(laughs)

06:12.206 --> 06:14.806
I DON'T KNOW.
UH, LET ME CHECK MY SCHEDULE.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.274
YEP, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
COMPLETELY EMPTY,

06:16.276 --> 06:18.577
SINCE I KNOW ABSOLUTELY
NOBODY ELSE.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.045
(giggles)

06:20.047 --> 06:21.546
COOL.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.615
LONELY BOY IS IN.

06:23.617 --> 06:26.084
GREAT. WELL, WE MEET
AFTER SCHOOL TOMORROW.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.753
AND, HEY, IF YOU DON'T
SHOW UP,

06:27.755 --> 06:29.621
I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE.
HA HA.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.623
MOVE IT OR LOSE IT, PEOPLE!

06:31.625 --> 06:33.925
JOEY!

06:36.597 --> 06:39.965
SO, CRAIG SHOULD BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

06:39.967 --> 06:42.901
I MADE SOME "MOMMA'S SORRY"
COOKIES TO APOLOGIZE.

06:45.038 --> 06:50.108
UM, BY "MADE" DID YOU MEAN
"OPENED THE BAG?"

06:50.110 --> 06:52.110
YOU KNOW,
AUNT MELANIE SAID

06:52.112 --> 06:55.981
THAT CRAIG SORT OF REINVENTED
HIMSELF THIS SUMMER.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.015
(doorbell rings)

06:57.017 --> 06:58.583
-OH.
-OH. YEAH.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.118
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.888
I MEAN, HOW BAD COULD
CRAIG POSSIBLY BE?

07:10.297 --> 07:14.933
BEHOLD MY ARRIVAL!

07:16.136 --> 07:17.736
(clears throat)
CRAIG.

07:18.839 --> 07:21.907
I HAVEN'T BEEN CRAIG SINCE
I WENT TO MAGIC CAMP.

07:23.043 --> 07:26.645
NOW I AM KNOWN AS
KRAHGG THE INSIDIOUS.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.282
WITH MY TRUSTY COMPANION
MANOLO THE CROW.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.853
ILLUSION!

07:37.991 --> 07:39.024
WHERE'S MY CROW?

07:39.026 --> 07:40.158
(crow cawing)

07:40.160 --> 07:42.127
(gasps)
MANOLO!

07:42.129 --> 07:43.579
HEY! COME BACK!

07:43.580 --> 07:45.030
THIS IS A STRANGE
NEIGHBORHOOD!

07:47.100 --> 07:50.635
AND IT JUST GOT STRANGER.

08:01.381 --> 08:04.783
WELL, THIS IS AWKWARD.

08:06.753 --> 08:07.786
OR IS IT...

08:07.788 --> 08:10.889
AMAZING?

08:10.891 --> 08:13.725
NOPE, IT'S AWKWARD.

08:13.727 --> 08:17.062
KRAHGG THE INSIDIOUS
WILL BREAK FREE

08:17.064 --> 08:20.232
AND BLOW YOUR MINDS!

08:23.804 --> 08:25.704
IN JUST ONE MORE MINUTE.

08:25.706 --> 08:28.206
CRAIG, IT'S BEEN,
LIKE, 15 MINUTES.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.342
IT'S KRAHGG.

08:30.344 --> 08:33.745
ALL RIGHT, I'VE HAD JUST
ABOUT ENOUGH OF THIS.

08:33.747 --> 08:35.447
(clears throat)

08:35.449 --> 08:37.716
ILLUSION!

08:40.053 --> 08:41.820
HEY, WHAT ARE THE RULES?

08:41.822 --> 08:43.188
CAN YOU PUNCH A COUSIN

08:43.190 --> 08:45.090
OR IS IT JUST BROTHERS
AND EVIL CLOWNS?

08:46.894 --> 08:49.828
I HAVE YOUR "BAAAHG," KRAHGG.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.196
DO NOT PEEK!

08:51.198 --> 08:53.999
IT HOLDS THE TOOLS
OF MY TRADE.

08:54.001 --> 08:56.434
THE DARK ART OF MAGIC!

08:56.436 --> 08:57.836
HA HA HA HA!

08:57.838 --> 09:00.105
I AM LEVITATING
AS WE SPEAK!

09:03.210 --> 09:06.311
IT'S JUST YOU'RE NOT,
THOUGH.

09:06.313 --> 09:07.979
REALLY?

09:07.981 --> 09:09.180
WHAT IF I'M LEVITATING
THE HOUSE

09:09.182 --> 09:11.182
AND ALL IT CONTAINS WITH ME

09:11.184 --> 09:13.752
SO YOU JUST CAN'T TELL?

09:15.088 --> 09:17.422
WITH CRAZY CRAIG BY MADDIE'S
SIDE AT THE PROM,

09:17.424 --> 09:20.892
NO OTHER BOY'S GONNA
WANT TO GET NEAR HER.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.193
CRAIG'S MY BOY.

09:24.798 --> 09:27.966
IT'S PRONOUNCED KRA--
(coughs)

09:27.968 --> 09:30.068
SORRY, IT'S JUST
TOO MUCH SMOKE.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.770
(coughs)
IT'S KRAHGG...

09:31.772 --> 09:35.106
(coughs)
THE INSIDIOUS.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.013
GREETINGS, COUSINS!

09:43.483 --> 09:45.383
WHICH ONE OF YOU
HAS THE COURAGE

09:45.385 --> 09:49.788
TO STEP INTO MY BOX
AND DISAPPEAR...

09:49.790 --> 09:52.357
INTO THE GREAT BEYOND?

09:56.063 --> 09:59.164
SOUNDS DUMB.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.800
I JUST CAME TO GET GRAPES.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.202
(gasps)
JOEY! THERE YOU ARE!

10:04.204 --> 10:06.237
KRAHGG, MAKE ME DISAPPEAR!

10:11.345 --> 10:13.979
AW, COME ON!

10:13.981 --> 10:16.314
JOEY, QUIT GOOFING AROUND.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.049
ILLUSION!

10:20.354 --> 10:22.187
ILLUSION!

10:24.157 --> 10:26.524
JOEY!

10:29.162 --> 10:32.097
(sing-song)
UH, HEY, WILLOW.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

10:34.034 --> 10:36.835
UM, I WAS WONDERING

10:36.837 --> 10:39.204
IF YOU'D ACCOMPANY ME
TO THE PROM?

10:39.206 --> 10:40.438
I GOT THE TICKETS,
THE DRESS

10:40.440 --> 10:43.375
AND ENOUGH LOVE IN MY
HEART FOR US BOTH.

10:43.377 --> 10:45.143
UH...

10:45.145 --> 10:47.545
UH...

10:49.082 --> 10:51.950
THIS TENSION
IS INSIDIOUS.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.451
LIKE I, KRAHGG--

10:53.453 --> 10:55.954

11:00.594 --> 11:02.327
UH...

11:02.328 --> 11:04.061

11:05.565 --> 11:08.033

11:08.035 --> 11:11.069
HE PROMISED HE'D HELP ME
SOUP UP OUR SWAN BOAT,

11:11.071 --> 11:13.271
AND THE ONLY NIGHT
WE CAN DO IT IS PROM NIGHT.

11:13.273 --> 11:16.207
DARN OUR BUSY
SOCIAL SCHEDULES.

11:17.511 --> 11:20.245
WAIT, YOU'RE FIXING UP
A SWAN BOAT?

11:20.247 --> 11:22.313
YEAH, YEAH.

11:22.315 --> 11:23.982
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.

11:23.984 --> 11:27.152
'CAUSE WE LOVE SWAN BOATS
SO MUCH, RIGHT, BRO?

11:27.154 --> 11:30.855
-HONK! HONK! HONK!
-HONK! HONK! HONK!

11:30.857 --> 11:31.923
CALLED IT.

11:31.925 --> 11:34.993
ONCE A HONKER,
ALWAYS A HONKER.

11:39.599 --> 11:40.632
HMM!

11:40.634 --> 11:42.133
HEY!

11:42.135 --> 11:44.069
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR HELPING OUT.

11:44.071 --> 11:46.204
THEY SAY YOU DON'T
REALLY, LIKE, KNOW SOMEONE

11:46.206 --> 11:48.606
UNTIL YOU'VE DECORATED
A MAGICAL KINGDOM TOGETHER.

11:48.608 --> 11:50.442
MY PLEASURE.

11:50.444 --> 11:52.177
HEY, I HEAR YOU'RE SINGING
A SONG AT PROM.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.112
YEAH. YES, I AM.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.147
UM, I'M ACTUALLY STILL IN
THE PROCESS OF WRITING IT,

11:56.149 --> 11:59.217
BUT I THINK I KNOW WHAT
I WANT IT TO BE ABOUT.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.653
IT'S NOT ABOUT
A NEW GUY AT SCHOOL

12:01.655 --> 12:03.188
YOU CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT, IS IT?

12:03.190 --> 12:06.958
(laughs)
NO!

12:06.960 --> 12:09.060
(laughs)
YES.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.296
YO, TAPE ME.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.200
WHOA!

12:15.202 --> 12:16.601
NICE CATCH.

12:16.603 --> 12:20.105
WHEN YOU HAVE FIVE BROTHERS
WHO THROW THINGS AT YOU,

12:20.107 --> 12:23.274
IT'S NOT REALLY A CATCH AS MUCH
AS A DEFENSE MECHANISM.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.976
(both laugh)

12:27.948 --> 12:28.980
WHAT?

12:28.982 --> 12:30.381
WHY ARE THERE CHANDELIERS

12:30.383 --> 12:32.183
WHERE MY BASKETBALL HOOP
USED TO BE?

12:32.185 --> 12:34.452
I NEED TO SHOOT THIS BALL!

12:34.454 --> 12:38.156
(clears throat)
MADDIE, ARE YOU OKAY?

12:40.660 --> 12:42.160
YEAH.
NO, I'M SORRY.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.429
I'M JUST TRYING TO
BLOW OFF SOME...

12:44.431 --> 12:47.031
"DIGGIE'S IN THE ARCTIC CIRCLE,
SO I HAVE TO GO TO THE PROM

12:47.033 --> 12:49.667
WITH MY COUSIN AND THE CROW
WHO LIVES IN HIS COAT" STEAM.

12:49.669 --> 12:51.136
(chuckles)

12:51.138 --> 12:53.638
HEY, MADDIE--
EXCUSE ME FOR A MINUTE.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.141
LIV, WE HAVE TO TRIM THE CURTAIN
BY THE ENTRANCE.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.676
-SCISSOR ME?
-OH. YEAH. YES.

12:58.678 --> 13:00.445
HERE YOU GO.

13:03.049 --> 13:05.150
OKAY, BYE!
(laughs nervously)

13:06.286 --> 13:07.485
(sing-song)
LIVY'S GOT A BOYFRIEND!

13:09.055 --> 13:11.072
CUT IT OUT!

13:11.073 --> 13:13.090
AND LAUGH LIKE I JUST SAID
SOMETHING REALLY FUNNY.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.160
(both laugh)

13:17.531 --> 13:18.563
DO YOU THINK HE LIKES ME?

13:18.565 --> 13:20.064
I THINK YOU LIKE HIM

13:20.066 --> 13:21.299
OR ELSE I WOULDN'T
HAVE SAID

13:21.301 --> 13:23.334
(sing-song)
"LIVY'S GOT A BOYFRIEND!"

13:23.336 --> 13:25.103
STOP IT!

13:25.105 --> 13:26.404
OKAY, SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?

13:26.406 --> 13:28.540
ARE YOU GONNA, LIKE,
ASK HIM TO PROM AND JUNK?

13:28.542 --> 13:31.342
WHAT? NO.
MADDIE, THAT'S A TERRIBLE PLAN.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.211
NO, MY PLAN IS ALREADY
SET IN MOTION.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.246
I'VE INTRODUCED HIM TO ANDIE.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.282
NEXT, I WILL ASK HER TO FISH
AROUND AND SEE IF HE DIGS ME,

13:37.284 --> 13:39.350
AND IF HE DOES, SHE WILL TELL
HIM THAT THE DIGGING IS MUTUAL,

13:39.352 --> 13:41.419
AND THEN BOOM, PROM!
IT'S REALLY QUITE SIMPLE.

13:41.421 --> 13:44.389
OKAY. OR, YOU KNOW,
YOU COULD JUST
SEIZE THE MOMENT

13:44.391 --> 13:46.524
AND GO ASK HIM YOURSELF.

13:46.526 --> 13:49.194
I MEAN, ISN'T THAT ALWAYS
WHAT YOU TELL ME TO DO?

13:49.196 --> 13:50.595
WELL, YEAH, I KNOW,
BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.597
I MEAN, THESE ARE MY FEELINGS.
IT'S, LIKE, WAY SCARIER.

13:53.767 --> 13:56.568
(snorts)
OKAY, LIV, THERE IS
NOTHING TO BE SCARED OF.

13:56.570 --> 13:59.270
BELIEVE ME IT'S QUITE OBVIOUS
THAT HE'S REALLY INTO YOU.

13:59.272 --> 14:03.208
JUST GO TELL HIM YOU
WANT TO GO TO PROM.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.710
YEAH.
(laughs)

14:04.711 --> 14:06.211
OKAY, YEAH, I KNOW,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:06.213 --> 14:08.446
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I'M BEING SO SILLY.

14:08.448 --> 14:11.216
I'M JUST GONNA GO ASK HIM.

14:11.218 --> 14:12.768
HEY!

14:12.769 --> 14:14.319
I'M GOING TO THE PROM
WITH HOLDEN!

14:14.321 --> 14:17.188
(squealing)

14:18.625 --> 14:19.657
(clears throat)

14:19.659 --> 14:21.292
WHAT WAS THAT?

14:21.294 --> 14:24.162
I'M TRYING TO DO
THE "EXCITED GIRL" SQUEAL,

14:24.164 --> 14:26.164
BUT I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.265
SORRY.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.802
WOW.

14:30.804 --> 14:33.171
WOW. ANDIE.

14:33.173 --> 14:34.339
OH, THIS IS SO BIG.

14:34.341 --> 14:36.608
YOU'RE GOING TO THE PROM
WITH HOLDEN.

14:36.610 --> 14:38.743
WOW. HOW DID THAT--
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

14:38.745 --> 14:40.144
I JUST ASKED HIM,
YOU KNOW?

14:40.146 --> 14:42.680
I LIKE HIM,
SO I SEIZED THE MOMENT.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.682
JUST LIKE YOU ALWAYS SAY.

14:44.684 --> 14:48.186
YES! THAT'S ME!
I'M A MOMENT SEIZER!

14:49.556 --> 14:51.623
THANK YOU FOR
INTRODUCING ME, LIV.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.191
I'M GOING TO THE PROM
WITH HOLDEN!

14:53.193 --> 14:56.561
(sing-song)
ANDIE'S GOT A BOYFRIEND!

14:56.563 --> 14:57.795
(laughs)

14:57.797 --> 14:59.097
HA HA.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.599
(sad sing-song)
ANDIE'S GOT A BOYFRIEND!

15:10.076 --> 15:11.709
THERE'S MY
BEAUTIFUL GIRL.

15:11.711 --> 15:15.113
OH! WE CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE YOU PERFORM
AT THE PROM TONIGHT.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.347
ARE YOU EXCITED?

15:16.349 --> 15:20.351

15:20.353 --> 15:23.221

15:28.295 --> 15:30.728
-(gasps)
-LIV, HELP!

15:32.265 --> 15:34.699
MY BROTHER STYLED ME
FOR THE PROM.

15:34.701 --> 15:38.803
WOW. YOU LOOK SO, UM...

15:38.805 --> 15:40.772
WHAT DID HE DO TO YOUR HAIR?

15:42.208 --> 15:44.809
WE DIDN'T HAVE A FLAT IRON,
SO THEY USED A WAFFLE IRON.

15:46.112 --> 15:49.480
UH, YES.
YEAH, THERE'S A...

15:49.482 --> 15:51.816
LITTLE PIECE OF WAFFLE
RIGHT THERE.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.486
HONEST ANSWER.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.355
DO YOU THINK HOLDEN'S
GONNA HATE THIS?

15:57.357 --> 16:00.591
WELL...

16:04.331 --> 16:06.864
STOP LOOKING AT ME
LIKE THAT!

16:06.866 --> 16:09.634
OF COURSE I'M GONNA FIX HER.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.903
DON'T WORRY. YOU ARE IN
THE HANDS OF A MASTER.

16:11.905 --> 16:14.272
YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY
FIXED MY MOM,

16:14.274 --> 16:16.174
AND SHE USED TO MATCH
HER LIPSTICK TO HER PURSE.

16:17.911 --> 16:20.578
THE PURSE WAS BLUE.
IT WAS A BAD TIME.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.415
AW, THERE'S MY BEAUT--

16:24.417 --> 16:26.184
-STOP.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.188
PRESS "PLAY!"

16:32.225 --> 16:34.258
(dramatic music playing)

16:40.867 --> 16:42.433
FEAST YOUR EYES

16:42.435 --> 16:46.771
UPON MY DARK ESSENCE!

16:46.773 --> 16:48.439
(Liv laughs)

16:48.441 --> 16:50.608
WOW. CRAIG, THAT'S--

16:50.610 --> 16:52.243
OH, NO, IT'S KRAHGG NOW.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.478
YEAH, I KNOW.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.279
I'M NOT DOING IT.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.816
THAT'S A REALLY UNIQUE LOOK
FOR, UH, FOR THE PROM.

16:58.818 --> 17:01.819
LOOKS LIKE, OOH, SOMETHING
OUT OF A NIGHTMARE.

17:01.821 --> 17:04.222
AS A PRACTITIONER
OF THE FANTASTICAL,

17:04.224 --> 17:06.491
I TAKE THAT
AS HIGH PRAISE.

17:06.493 --> 17:08.226
ALL RIGHT.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.461
UH, COME ON. LET'S GO GET YOU
FIXED UP FOR PROM.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.196
WHAT--REALLY?

17:12.198 --> 17:14.232
I THINK SHE LOOKS GREAT.

17:14.234 --> 17:16.401
LIV, FIX ME!

17:17.771 --> 17:20.371
NOW, LET'S BE OFF!

17:20.373 --> 17:22.774
SHALL WE GO BY CAR...

17:22.776 --> 17:25.943
OR BY ILLUSION?

17:27.981 --> 17:30.982
WATCH AS I DISAPPEAR!

17:34.654 --> 17:36.854
KRAHGG, HONEY,
WE CAN STILL SEE YOU.

17:36.856 --> 17:39.357
YOU SEE NOTHING!

17:46.900 --> 17:48.366
NEXT WE WELCOME

17:48.368 --> 17:50.902
HOLDEN AND ANDIE!

17:50.904 --> 17:53.371
(applause)

17:54.707 --> 17:56.240
HOLDEN'S THE NEW KID,

17:56.242 --> 17:59.444
AND ANDIE'S A WORLD-CLASS
SPOT WELDER.

18:00.814 --> 18:03.448
WOW! ANDIE, YOU LOOK GREAT!

18:03.450 --> 18:05.817
THANKS. IT WAS LIV'S IDEA
TO FIX THE DRESS

18:05.819 --> 18:07.985
AND GET THE WAFFLE GUNK
OUT OF MY HAIR.

18:07.987 --> 18:09.854
SHE HAS GREAT
FASHION SENSE.

18:11.958 --> 18:14.258
AND NOW LET'S WELCOME

18:14.260 --> 18:18.029
MADDIE AND KRAHGG
THE INSIDIOUS!

18:18.031 --> 18:20.998
(applause)

18:21.000 --> 18:22.700
SHE'S MY DAUGHTER.

18:22.702 --> 18:26.437
HE'S...RELATED
ONLY BY MARRIAGE.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.941
ALL RIGHT,
SO WE ARE HERE NOW.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.676
LET'S JUST TRY AND KEEP
A LOW PROFILE.

18:32.979 --> 18:36.013
ATTENTION, RIDGEWOOD!

18:38.318 --> 18:42.587
I AM GOING TO LEVITATE MY BODY
IN THE AIR BY MYSTICAL MEANS!

18:42.589 --> 18:43.921
WHAT?
OKAY, NO!

18:43.923 --> 18:46.891
OKAY, KRAHGG, PLEASE
DO NOT DO THIS.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.426
YOU'RE TERRIBLE
AT ILLUSIONS.

18:48.427 --> 18:49.960
YOU REALLY DON'T WANT
EVERYONE MAKING FUN OF YOU.

18:49.963 --> 18:52.497
THE DOUBTERS ALWAYS DOUBT.

18:52.499 --> 18:54.899
OKAY.

18:54.901 --> 18:57.068
(exhales)

18:57.070 --> 18:59.303
ILLUSION!

19:00.473 --> 19:01.739
HA HA HA HA!

19:01.741 --> 19:03.908
(crowd gasps, applause)

19:03.910 --> 19:05.810
OH, YOU'RE DOING IT!

19:05.812 --> 19:06.844
YOU DID IT!

19:06.846 --> 19:08.045
THAT'S MY COUSIN!

19:08.047 --> 19:10.548
BAM! WHAT THE WHAT?

19:10.550 --> 19:13.050
REMEMBER MY NAME!

19:13.052 --> 19:13.985
I AM KRAHGG--

19:13.987 --> 19:16.087
OW!

19:18.892 --> 19:21.025
AVERT YOUR EYES
OR FEEL MY WRATH!

19:23.563 --> 19:26.664
HEY! HEY! COME ON!
STOP RECORDING!

19:26.666 --> 19:28.566
THAT GUY'S RECORDING!

19:28.568 --> 19:31.702
THAT'S NOT COOL, GUY.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.878
YOU KNOW, I KNOW I ONLY SAID
I WOULD DO THIS

19:40.880 --> 19:43.014
TO GET OUT OF GOING
TO PROM WITH WILLOW,

19:43.016 --> 19:45.082
BUT I'M ACTUALLY HAVING FUN.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.420
THERE'S MY LITTLE MAN!

19:51.024 --> 19:52.990
WILLOW, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

19:52.992 --> 19:55.126
I FIGURED IF WE CAN'T
GO TO THE PROM TOGETHER,

19:55.128 --> 19:57.495
WE COULD "NOT" GO TOGETHER.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.697
SO...

19:59.699 --> 20:01.599
I'M HERE TO HELP
FIX SWANNY.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.467
WELL, YOU GOOD
WITH A WRENCH?

20:05.805 --> 20:08.706
NOTHING FITS BETTER
IN MY HAND...

20:08.708 --> 20:10.408
EXCEPT JOEY'S HAND.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.910
OH, NO.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.546
(wrench clicking)

20:15.548 --> 20:16.948
HAVE FUN, KIDS!

20:16.950 --> 20:19.750
WILLOW, DON'T KEEP HIM
OUT TOO LATE.

20:24.857 --> 20:27.892
ONCE UPON A TIME,
OUR DAUGHTER LIV

20:27.894 --> 20:31.028
