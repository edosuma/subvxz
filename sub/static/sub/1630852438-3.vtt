<i>[Felipe] </i>Once I won

<i>I had to prove that I was</i>

<i>At that time, there was</i>
<i>no official competition in that field.</i>

<i>And in the distance,</i>
<i>I saw a body floating.</i>

07:06.717 --> 07:08.886
<i>At that moment, the body turned around…</i>

07:10.972 --> 07:12.348
<i>and it had my face.</i>

07:14.225 --> 07:17.353
<i>I thought,</i>
<i>"I'm afraid I'm in serious trouble."</i>

07:19.397 --> 07:21.566
<i>I started swimming to the surface,</i>

07:22.108 --> 07:22.984
<i>for air.</i>

07:29.073 --> 07:30.783
<i>"Just one more stroke."</i>

07:58.436 --> 07:59.562
<i>I got a cut here,</i>

08:00.771 --> 08:05.776
<i>and I asked the doctor</i>
<i>if he could make the stitches waterproof.</i>

08:07.820 --> 08:10.573
<i>The doctor said,</i>
<i>"Why? You can't go in the water."</i>

08:12.283 --> 08:15.995
<i>And I immediately said,</i>
<i>"Doctor, please, let's be honest!"</i>

08:16.996 --> 08:19.624
<i>"I'm going straight back</i>
<i>to the sea when we're done."</i>

<i>[Pope Francis] People who have</i>

<i>You need to have a dialogue with fear.</i>

<i>with an umbrella and jumped.</i>

09:13.886 --> 09:15.304
<i>Broke his arm. [chuckles]</i>

09:17.014 --> 09:19.267
<i>I mean, he didn't even consider fear.</i>

09:20.268 --> 09:22.812
<i>He wasn't afraid.</i>
<i>And in that case, fear was needed.</i>
