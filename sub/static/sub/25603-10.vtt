00:01.653 --> 00:03.394
-Previously on Wynonna Earp:

00:03.438 --> 00:06.267
You and Juan Carlo
and Constance sealed
Bulshar underground!

00:06.310 --> 00:10.053
-There has to be a way
to beat him.
-Soon that weapon will be mine.

00:10.097 --> 00:11.837
-I don't feel well.
-Give me the ring!!!

00:11.881 --> 00:13.709
-Take it!!
:
Your father's ring,

00:13.752 --> 00:16.016
-it found you.
-Waverly Earp,

00:16.059 --> 00:18.670
you sweet little lesbian,
you did it, you healed me!

00:18.714 --> 00:20.498
Bulshar was looking
for the Garden.

00:20.542 --> 00:23.284
You need the Tower
to get into the Garden.
Peacemaker is the Tower.

00:24.850 --> 00:27.157
Say you did not give up
Wyatt Earp's gun.

00:31.335 --> 00:34.034
"The guardians were powerless
in the face of evil

00:34.077 --> 00:36.558
that the serpent
was perpetrating.

00:36.601 --> 00:38.299
What could they do?

00:38.342 --> 00:40.997
Their remit
was to stand by idly,

00:41.041 --> 00:43.347
even as a new reign
of terror began."

00:44.305 --> 00:45.828
Forgive me, Father Juan Carlo.

00:47.656 --> 00:49.005
Wyatt Earp is coming.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.355
And right on time.

00:52.313 --> 00:55.533
The Blood Eclipse occurs
on this very night.

00:55.577 --> 00:58.754
-I had hoped
we would be spared.

00:58.797 --> 01:00.408
Bulshar spares none.

01:00.451 --> 01:03.367
Hope, Robert,
is God's greatest gift to us.

01:03.411 --> 01:04.368
Miss Maeve?

01:05.587 --> 01:07.241
Do you hope

01:07.284 --> 01:09.286
That is not for me to say,
Mr. Svane.

01:10.157 --> 01:11.897
I'll return this to your room,
Padre.

01:11.941 --> 01:15.162
No. No. Take it home.
Conceal it.

01:16.293 --> 01:17.207
Yes, Padre.

01:18.817 --> 01:21.516
Robert.
We need to ride to the flats.

01:22.995 --> 01:26.303
We need to get Peacemaker
to the champion.

01:26.347 --> 01:29.263
Yes, Father.
With haste we must.

01:29.306 --> 01:34.920
-We must, we must, we must--

01:34.964 --> 01:36.139
Bobo, I'm begging you.

01:36.183 --> 01:39.055
Give me something
I can hold onto. Please.

01:39.099 --> 01:39.751
Yes.

01:42.450 --> 01:43.103
Hope.

01:44.756 --> 01:46.454
But it's gone.

01:48.238 --> 01:49.370
It's gone.

01:52.851 --> 01:54.201
It's gone.

01:54.244 --> 01:56.725
Guess you must feel
pretty useless too, huh, Bobo?

02:01.425 --> 02:05.255
We are the heirs of cruelty
and torture.

02:05.299 --> 02:07.866
-I'm sorry,
we have to keep you in here.
-No.

02:07.910 --> 02:10.173
I can't be trusted.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.654
-Out of the mouths of Bae.

02:12.697 --> 02:15.918
Hi. We brought you
a quintuple-shot latte.

02:15.961 --> 02:17.746
Yeah, the barista said
it was like drinking a litre

02:17.789 --> 02:20.401
of espresso straight-up,
but we made her make it anyhoo.

02:20.444 --> 02:21.358
It'll do.

02:24.187 --> 02:25.928
-Meh.

02:27.408 --> 02:28.670
Bobo knows something
that might help

02:28.713 --> 02:30.759
with this whole
end-of-the-world mishigas.

02:30.802 --> 02:33.718
But he can't pull it off
his French-fried hard drive.

02:33.762 --> 02:34.937
I'm worried about you.

02:35.894 --> 02:38.027
With Doc and your gun gone,
you know?

02:38.070 --> 02:40.160
Even allowing for the whole
end-of-the-world mishigas.

02:41.465 --> 02:43.467
-Alright, I gotta go.

02:43.511 --> 02:46.949
I don't know. Just...
I can't sit here and do this.

02:46.992 --> 02:48.168
Research is your thing.

02:49.386 --> 02:50.126
Hey.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.650
You're still the heir, Wynonna.

02:53.651 --> 02:54.826
We're counting on you.

02:56.480 --> 03:00.049
Spoiler alert:
being the heir sucks balls.

03:11.495 --> 03:12.279
Ah!

03:14.237 --> 03:16.108
Come and get it, Chosen One.

03:22.376 --> 03:25.335
♪ 'Cause I gave you
all I got to give ♪

03:25.379 --> 03:27.859
♪ I know
that ain't no way to live ♪

03:27.903 --> 03:30.340
♪ I told that devil

03:30.384 --> 03:32.951
♪ To take you back

03:32.995 --> 03:37.956
♪ I told that devil
to take you back ♪♪

03:41.351 --> 03:45.703
Bulshar knows
where the Garden of Eden is,
and he has the key to open it.

03:45.747 --> 03:46.661
What do we have?

03:47.618 --> 03:50.012
Uh... each other?

03:50.055 --> 03:50.795
Squat.

03:51.970 --> 03:54.930
And...
and really great calves.

03:54.973 --> 03:56.323
Both of us.

03:56.366 --> 03:58.716
No, seriously, have you ever
contemplated these?

03:58.760 --> 04:02.024
Yeah, that's all genetics, too.

04:02.067 --> 04:03.417
Like, I don't even
take the stairs.

04:05.810 --> 04:08.552
Yeah, well, it sucks that those
works of art will be destroyed
by Bulshar's reign of evil.

04:08.596 --> 04:11.207
Yeah, my gams
are the real victims here.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.340
Hey, all I'm trying to say is...

04:14.471 --> 04:16.691
...we can't give up.
We can't.

04:16.734 --> 04:19.389
I know, but I don't know
what else to look at!

04:19.433 --> 04:22.827
We've read every bit
of history and research
we could get our hands on

04:22.871 --> 04:25.569
and... and it's not like Bulshar
has Pinterest!

04:25.613 --> 04:27.919
Whenever I'm confused
watching Game of Thrones,

04:27.963 --> 04:30.922
I, uh, watch a recap
of the season to remember

04:30.966 --> 04:33.708
which bearded guy
cut off the head
of the other bearded guy--

04:33.751 --> 04:35.579
Care Bear, looming apocalypse?

04:35.623 --> 04:38.365
We need a recap.

04:39.931 --> 04:43.500
Okay. Okay. Right.

04:43.544 --> 04:46.329
We know Bulshar has some kind
of power over the woods.

04:46.373 --> 04:47.896
Yeah, that guy would kill
on Tinder.

04:47.939 --> 04:50.507
Like if the Giving Tree had sex
with a Stephen King story.

04:50.551 --> 04:54.294
He wants into the Garden.
Do we know why?

04:54.337 --> 04:56.339
Maybe that's tree-related too.

04:56.383 --> 05:00.474
Yeah, the Bible claims
there were two trees
in the Garden of Eden. Right?

05:00.517 --> 05:02.606
The Tree of Life
and the Tree of Knowledge.

05:02.650 --> 05:05.653
Not only the Bible,
but the Kabbalah, the Talmud,

05:05.696 --> 05:08.177
the Qu'ran and that really weird
Hugh Jackman film.

05:08.220 --> 05:10.179
But it's in Purgatory?

05:11.049 --> 05:12.616
We don't even have an Ikea!

05:12.660 --> 05:15.793
-Let me out!!
I want out of this cage.

05:15.837 --> 05:17.404
Now.

05:17.447 --> 05:20.407
Well, a cage has bars. It's
technically more of a terrarium.

05:20.450 --> 05:23.801
Yeah, that's usually where
people keep lizards, so...

05:25.803 --> 05:28.763
He... took her book.

05:47.651 --> 05:50.393
-Hey, gorgeous.

05:50.437 --> 05:52.395
Well, if you start early,
it encourages growth.

05:53.788 --> 05:55.180
I'm fixing your lawnmower.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.360
-No, see, you're Wynonna Earp,
you're supposed to say, uh...

06:00.403 --> 06:02.579
"Is that code?" And I say,
"No, but I'd like it to be."

06:02.623 --> 06:04.146
And then you say, um...

06:05.147 --> 06:07.018
"My lawn is perfectly trimmed."

06:07.062 --> 06:10.805
-And then, I say something--
-We're T-minus 24 hours
to an apocalypse.

06:10.848 --> 06:12.110
Everyone's gonna die.

06:13.416 --> 06:14.199
Huh...

06:16.854 --> 06:18.639
Well, if we don't,

06:18.682 --> 06:20.380
you're gonna want
a nice soft place
to have a picnic.

06:25.080 --> 06:25.994
We're hugging?

06:26.037 --> 06:27.778
-Shush.

06:29.301 --> 06:31.347
Should I be nice and normal more
or never, ever again?

06:31.391 --> 06:34.481
-I said shush.
-Okay, shushing now.

06:37.222 --> 06:38.398
-Doc.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.008
-Doc.

06:40.051 --> 06:42.837
I feel you, son.

06:44.491 --> 06:46.884
-Ask Holliday about a witch.
-Okay.

06:46.928 --> 06:49.191
-Her name is...

06:49.234 --> 06:52.890
-Juan Carlo. Juan Carlo.
-No. No! No, Bobo!

06:52.934 --> 06:54.718
Juan Carlo was the Father.

06:54.762 --> 06:58.200
-No! Juan Carlo said
they were wrong.

06:58.243 --> 07:00.985
He defended her
when no one else did.

07:01.029 --> 07:02.030
They didn't care.

07:03.118 --> 07:04.554
They never cared.

07:05.686 --> 07:08.166
He's coming.

07:08.210 --> 07:09.820
-Bobo.
-He's coming.
-Bobo, stay with me.

07:09.864 --> 07:12.823
-Ride for the flats!
Ride for the flats!!
-Bobo! Bobo, wait!

07:12.867 --> 07:15.478
-And... he's gone.

07:15.522 --> 07:18.089
You guys capture
a pterodactyl or something?

07:18.133 --> 07:21.266
No, it's just Bobo.
Flipping the flip out.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.530
You want me to flip him
in the flippers? Balls.

07:23.573 --> 07:27.229
Do you want me
to kick him in the...
in... in the balls? No. Okay.

07:27.272 --> 07:28.535
Hey, do you know where Doc is?

07:28.578 --> 07:31.363
Uh, no, but I'm pretty sure
I can find him.

07:31.407 --> 07:32.626
Good.

07:32.669 --> 07:33.888
Ask him who...

07:35.193 --> 07:36.717
...Maeve was.

07:38.501 --> 07:40.460
Kinda thought
you might be avoiding me again.

07:41.765 --> 07:43.158
No, just been busy.

07:45.203 --> 07:47.336
If anybody was gonna
get cold feet after a date
involving a reanimated witch,

07:47.379 --> 07:49.512
-I figured it'd be me.
-Yeah, well, that was cool.

07:49.556 --> 07:52.733
-Some might say super cool.
-But then I got, uh...

07:54.561 --> 07:56.563
...stuck in a booby-trapped
house with a vampire,

07:56.606 --> 08:00.523
a demon and an over-dramatic
douche in a fur coat.

08:00.567 --> 08:03.787
Plus the world's ending
any minute, so...

08:03.831 --> 08:05.572
smoke 'em if you got 'em.

08:05.615 --> 08:06.573
I don't got 'em.

08:08.488 --> 08:12.187
Bulshar turned people
into trees
and used their root system

08:12.230 --> 08:16.408
to find the Garden -
as in, the... the Garden.

08:17.627 --> 08:20.412
It's... it's pretty ingenious,
actually.

08:20.456 --> 08:21.805
Are you fan-girling
the bad guy?

08:23.938 --> 08:26.723
He's winning.
And I'm just not sure
what other options are on

08:26.767 --> 08:28.856
-my tiny little table
at the moment.

08:31.336 --> 08:32.773
We could go see who that is.

08:33.774 --> 08:35.689
You got your magic gun
ready to go?

08:35.732 --> 08:37.952
-I gave it to my mortal enemy.

08:38.909 --> 08:41.085
To be fair, it was a regift.

08:47.918 --> 08:49.354
You're on my porch!

08:49.398 --> 08:52.140
Wow, you're a regular
Mariska Hargitay.

08:52.183 --> 08:53.663
-No gun.
-No.

08:59.669 --> 09:01.323
I'm Kevin.

09:01.366 --> 09:03.238
And I'm gonna help you
save the world, Earp.

09:05.153 --> 09:06.589
Next time, lead with that.

09:11.638 --> 09:13.422
Take it.
The money's in the menu.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.992
It's too much.
I only brought one.

09:18.035 --> 09:19.820
One bag? You brought me
one bag?!

09:20.908 --> 09:24.041
All I could get
without catching shit.
Make it last.

09:37.315 --> 09:39.317
You know,
you have a liquor licence.

09:39.361 --> 09:41.668
You don't have to brown-bag it
in your own bar.

09:41.711 --> 09:42.669
Officer Haught.

09:44.235 --> 09:47.238
Unless that isn't illicit hooch
and something way grosser.

09:47.282 --> 09:49.676
Bloody Mary mix it is not.
I have a contact

09:49.719 --> 09:51.460
at the veterinarian clinic.
He assures me--

09:51.503 --> 09:53.331
You know what? It's probably
better I don't know.

09:53.375 --> 09:56.639
Right. I do apologize
for involving you
in my intimate affairs.

09:56.683 --> 09:59.599
Well, can't Kate help you
with, uh, that?

10:00.730 --> 10:04.865
No. No, she's gone
without a trace.

10:04.908 --> 10:07.302
She always did have a flair
for the dramatic.

10:07.345 --> 10:08.608
Because Wynonna?

10:10.305 --> 10:13.395
That is also
a rather intimate affair.

10:13.438 --> 10:16.137
Just know I would do
whatever I can to keep her safe.

10:16.180 --> 10:18.313
Okay, good. 'Cause I'm here
to drag you on a recon mission.

10:18.356 --> 10:23.057
-Because Wynonna and... Bulshar.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.581
Bobo said for me to ask you...

10:26.626 --> 10:27.583
about this.

10:31.108 --> 10:32.240
Maeve.

10:33.807 --> 10:36.070
Her name is Maeve Perley.

10:36.113 --> 10:37.854
Maeve as in
"Mattie the Blacksmith

10:37.898 --> 10:40.204
and Gretta when you wish
upon a bitch" Perley?

10:40.248 --> 10:42.685
Nobody ever really leaves
Purgatory.

10:42.729 --> 10:45.079
Okay, well, there's something
about Maeve having a book.

10:45.122 --> 10:46.733
She kept it for Juan Carlo?

10:46.776 --> 10:49.692
-At the Perley homestead.
-Worth a shot.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.520
I will accompany you,
but, uh...

10:53.130 --> 10:56.568
...I find myself rather powerful
hungry, Officer Haught.

10:57.657 --> 11:02.270
And as this state of being is,
uh, rather new to me,

11:02.313 --> 11:06.535
you have my permission
to defend yourself should I...

11:07.492 --> 11:09.451
...should I cross
any boundaries.

11:17.198 --> 11:19.417
-Wooden bullets.
-Yeah, so I've got it covered.

11:21.637 --> 11:23.291
-Thank you, though.
-No.

11:25.162 --> 11:26.033
Thank you.

11:30.124 --> 11:32.343
I'm a representative
of a long line of ambassadors

11:32.387 --> 11:34.302
tasked with looking after
the balance in the world.

11:34.345 --> 11:36.652
-She's like the Williams
sisters.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.262
Did I stutter?

11:38.306 --> 11:39.960
God.

11:40.003 --> 11:42.223
Usually, we only watch.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.094
We observe and record,
but don't participate.

11:44.138 --> 11:46.096
But these are desperate times.

11:46.140 --> 11:49.230
Well, no kidding. I just spent
months in a demon-run
alt-reality prison.

11:49.273 --> 11:52.581
Do you truly intend
to go up against the beast
with no training, no blade,

11:52.624 --> 11:54.583
-and is that
what you are wearing?
-Hey.

11:54.626 --> 11:56.063
As in, hey, guess what,

11:56.106 --> 11:58.848
Kevin knows of a weapon
that may stop said beast.

12:03.070 --> 12:05.202
You drink too much,
you couldn't find your ass
with a map--

12:05.246 --> 12:08.205
I dunno.
-And you are literally
our only hope.

12:08.249 --> 12:09.772
That's what I've been saying!

12:09.816 --> 12:14.342
Hey, I took an extraordinary
risk coming here.

12:14.385 --> 12:16.083
My bosses - the Menfolk -

12:16.126 --> 12:18.825
do not think you deserve
this weapon or can wield it,

12:18.868 --> 12:21.871
but I am fairly sick
of their boy bullshit.

12:21.915 --> 12:25.614
And I'm fairly certain that
if you weren't such a douchebag,
we could hang.

12:25.657 --> 12:26.267
Hmm.

12:27.921 --> 12:30.271
It'll come at a cost,
to you and your team.

12:30.314 --> 12:33.361
-It always does.
-Well, then, say your goodbyes

12:33.404 --> 12:35.319
and switch those pants.
You're going hunting.

12:35.363 --> 12:37.278
Again,
I'm not changing this outfit.

12:37.321 --> 12:41.456
Well, times like these,
I really wish I could
force people to do things.

12:41.499 --> 12:42.413
For their own good.

12:44.676 --> 12:47.941
-But I cannot say more
in front of a civilian.
-Well, I'm a firefighter.

12:51.031 --> 12:53.642
You seriously have a line
on an actual Bulshar killer?

12:57.864 --> 12:59.779
Chucky? Quick porch chat.

13:01.737 --> 13:04.000
-You're kidding.
-Yeah, she'll do that.

13:08.396 --> 13:10.093
You don't even know
what this woman is.

13:10.137 --> 13:13.183
I know she can rock a suit
and karate chops necks
like a champ.

13:13.227 --> 13:15.229
-She called me a civilian.
-Yeah, it's a compliment.

13:15.272 --> 13:17.492
It means you're not
a supernatural weirdo.

13:17.535 --> 13:21.017
Okay, look, look, Wynonna,
I baby-sat your vampire
ex-boyfriend for you.

13:21.061 --> 13:23.063
-Yes.
-I killed a bunch
of psycho dudes

13:23.106 --> 13:27.458
dressed up as beekeepers
and I yanked the arm
off some zombie witch. For you.

13:27.502 --> 13:30.505
Very helpful.
And now I am gonna need you
to scoot your boots.

13:32.072 --> 13:33.247
I just don't know
what's happening here.

13:35.292 --> 13:37.860
-Well... it's fine,
'cause it's not about you.

13:39.557 --> 13:42.647
I'm trying to stop
a bloody apocalypse, okay?

13:42.691 --> 13:44.301
It's maybe not the time
to pull out the needy act.

13:44.345 --> 13:47.870
N Wynonna,
I'm trying to actually help you.

13:47.914 --> 13:49.654
-You don't even know
who this random lady is.
-Okay,

13:49.698 --> 13:52.483
let's just press pause on this

13:52.527 --> 13:55.922
and resume the butt-hurt song
and dance after I off Bulshar.

13:58.315 --> 14:01.666
Yep. We can definitely
press pause on this.

14:01.710 --> 14:02.842
No problem.

14:05.279 --> 14:07.455
Charlie... Tsk.

14:07.498 --> 14:09.631
You can for sure mow my lawn
in the spring!

14:14.114 --> 14:15.463
If we even get to spring.

14:22.296 --> 14:24.733
-You must be the sister.
-Yeah.

14:26.213 --> 14:27.431
Where's the other sister?

14:27.475 --> 14:29.433
Oh, she got dragged outside
by Mr. Flame.

14:29.477 --> 14:31.305
Hey, does your boyfriend
tell you what to do too?

14:31.348 --> 14:34.917
-Don't have a boyfriend.

14:34.961 --> 14:38.051
Weather update: being the heir
still sucks balls.

14:38.094 --> 14:40.009
Appreciate the weather update.
Now can I have

14:40.053 --> 14:42.882
the "there's a woman
in our kitchen
eating our pickles" update?

14:42.925 --> 14:44.753
She says she's from
a mysterious bunch of--

14:44.796 --> 14:45.928
World savers.

14:48.061 --> 14:50.759
-I believe we're running out
of options, my gun is gone.

14:50.802 --> 14:54.197
Plus Miss Maître D' claims
she can help us find
a special weapon.

14:54.241 --> 14:56.069
One that'll take down Bulshar.

14:56.112 --> 14:57.331
It's a magical arm.

15:02.771 --> 15:03.772
Grab a pickle.

15:04.991 --> 15:08.559
Maeve. Some people claimed
she was a witch.

15:08.603 --> 15:10.474
Well, it does seem
to run in the family.

15:10.518 --> 15:14.435
She lived alone,
she wrote in books all day,

15:14.478 --> 15:17.655
-she would not speak to men.
-Sounds like my kind of woman.

15:20.789 --> 15:23.661
She helped other women
with, uh, women things.

15:23.705 --> 15:26.751
Childbirth...
not having children.

15:26.795 --> 15:29.058
I bet this has a happy ending.

15:29.102 --> 15:31.408
Mob came, all riled up,
and got to her

15:31.452 --> 15:35.543
-just mere days before Wyatt
shot old Sheriff Clootie.
-Bulshar.

15:36.457 --> 15:38.981
They burned her...
at the stake.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.591
Jesus. You serious?

15:40.635 --> 15:45.292
I thought
you should be aware
before we go in.

15:45.335 --> 15:49.122
Bulshar's severed arm
is still in the mine
where he was entombed.

15:49.165 --> 15:50.688
I confirmed it myself.

15:50.732 --> 15:53.474
-That would be interfering.

15:53.517 --> 15:55.432
I was really hoping
for more of a flamethrower.

15:55.476 --> 15:57.521
A ride-on flamethrower
with cup-holders.

15:57.565 --> 16:00.307
-And heated seats.
-And a hula girl on the dash!

16:00.350 --> 16:02.483
Nope, just the arm.

16:02.526 --> 16:04.659
Only the champion
can retrieve it.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.530
Then we synthesize a weapon
to defeat him.

16:08.706 --> 16:11.144
I mean, it's about as logical
as using people trees
to find the Garden of Eden.

16:11.187 --> 16:14.060
Yeah, except the mine
is totally unstable.

16:14.103 --> 16:15.583
Right? Really dangerous.

16:15.626 --> 16:17.063
It could collapse.

16:17.106 --> 16:18.368
-Okay, I'm in.
-Me too.

16:20.457 --> 16:22.503
You know I want your help,
baby girl, but--

16:22.546 --> 16:25.810
But what? No, I'm not
gonna sit here waiting
for the world to end,

16:25.854 --> 16:29.771
!

16:29.814 --> 16:32.687
-So you girls
really gonna do this, huh?
-Don't be pushy, brine breath.

16:34.558 --> 16:36.996
-Yeah, we are.

16:38.519 --> 16:39.520
Ride or die.

16:42.392 --> 16:43.698
My money's on die.

16:51.227 --> 16:52.620
Gretta, you in here?

16:53.664 --> 16:56.145
Gretta's vehicle
is not in the drive.

16:56.189 --> 16:59.061
There are no shoes
in the doorway.

17:00.845 --> 17:03.587
She has apparently
turned off the heat.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.895
She's gone.

17:06.938 --> 17:10.290
Yeah, there seems to be
a lot of that
going around town these days.

17:10.333 --> 17:12.683
Like the town folk know
something is comin'.

17:14.903 --> 17:17.253
Oof. It's freezing in here.

17:17.297 --> 17:20.300
If we are gonna continue
our search, we need a fire.

17:31.441 --> 17:34.836
How dare you enter my home?!

17:34.879 --> 17:35.837
Maeve Perley?!

17:37.056 --> 17:40.798
Is that you?
I am John Henry Holliday!

17:40.842 --> 17:43.323
You are Wyatt Earp's boyfriend.

17:46.804 --> 17:47.762
Yeah, fine.

17:49.111 --> 17:52.027
Did you keep a journal
for the Padre Juan Carlo?

17:52.071 --> 17:56.075
-Uh, okay.

17:58.686 --> 18:01.384
-The world is ending, Maeve.

18:01.428 --> 18:04.083
I'm locked in fire for eternity!

18:05.736 --> 18:08.652
No body, no boys, no booze.

18:11.742 --> 18:13.483
That book
could really help us out.

18:13.527 --> 18:15.790
"That book
could really help us out."

18:15.833 --> 18:17.835
Okay, I'm pretty good
with teen girls.

18:17.879 --> 18:20.186
You just quit it with the poker.
Let me take it, okay?

18:22.449 --> 18:24.320
Hey, Maeve. Hi.

18:24.364 --> 18:27.193
Um, Officer Nicole Haught here.

18:27.236 --> 18:31.632
-Yeah, this isn't gonna work.

18:33.721 --> 18:35.723
: Oh, hush!

18:35.766 --> 18:37.028
That's right.

18:37.072 --> 18:41.598
You shut your little mouth,
John Henry.

18:41.642 --> 18:43.818
-Not anymore.

18:47.735 --> 18:50.477
Hi.

18:52.740 --> 18:55.743
: Okay, so all we do
is we find Bulshar's arm
and then we get out of here.

18:55.786 --> 18:57.832
-Easy-breezy tequila squeezy.
-That's not how that goes.

18:57.875 --> 18:59.660
I don't take that from someone
wearing an oven mitt.

18:59.703 --> 19:01.227
-It's a precaution.
-It's fugly.

19:01.270 --> 19:03.751
-Well, it's the only one
Mercedes had, okay?

19:04.752 --> 19:07.929
I still haven't had the chance
to tell you that I saw her.

19:10.366 --> 19:12.542
-Oof.
-Yeah.

19:12.586 --> 19:15.154
Once we stop the apocalypse,
I'll make her
redneck margaritas,

19:15.197 --> 19:17.895
buy her a dress with pockets.
She'll plotz.

19:24.728 --> 19:25.990
You get out of my friend!

19:27.078 --> 19:31.605
Something is different
about you, John Henry.

19:31.648 --> 19:33.824
Oh...

19:35.174 --> 19:37.263
You're undead.

19:37.306 --> 19:40.266
Well, that's gonna make this
really easy.

19:40.309 --> 19:44.922
See... I need, like,
a fresh body.

19:45.836 --> 19:46.968
To move into.

19:52.452 --> 19:53.409
Ah.

19:56.891 --> 19:59.937
Here... vampire.

20:01.548 --> 20:03.854
Do you want the book that
tells you how to defeat Bulshar?

20:05.291 --> 20:08.555
Okay. Well,
then why don't you kill her,

20:08.598 --> 20:09.904
and give me this body?

20:27.922 --> 20:31.099
What the hell's that?
Yeti

20:31.142 --> 20:33.275
Whole bunch of puppies
wearing a trench coat?

20:33.319 --> 20:35.321
Wait! This was a uranium mine
back in the day.

20:35.364 --> 20:40.717
-So my guess:
radioactive Revenant?

20:40.761 --> 20:42.371
How come it's never puppies?

20:46.027 --> 20:46.897
Come on.

20:48.769 --> 20:50.858
Just a little nibble?

20:55.993 --> 20:58.779
-Sheriff Haught is my friend.
-I...

21:00.302 --> 21:04.611
I, like... cannot stay in here
much longer.

21:04.654 --> 21:05.786
So...

21:07.135 --> 21:10.486
...you need to go
and fetch me a new corpse,

21:10.530 --> 21:13.010
and then... you get your book.

21:13.054 --> 21:15.926
Oh, and you have to kill it
in front of me

21:15.970 --> 21:17.798
so there's no time
for organ failure.

21:17.841 --> 21:19.278
No.

21:19.321 --> 21:22.498
No, there is no bargain here,
Perley.

21:22.542 --> 21:25.371
Now you get out of that body
this instant!

21:25.414 --> 21:26.807
Make me.

21:26.850 --> 21:29.288
-Okay.
-Oh, yes.

21:29.331 --> 21:31.420
Oh, thank kale it's not salad.

21:31.464 --> 21:34.728
You know, eating fried potatoes
is my payback
against the bad man

21:34.771 --> 21:36.730
who made me regurgitate dirt
for the last month.

21:36.773 --> 21:39.036
-Yeah, peachy.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.561
I mean, I did cough up
a blueberry the other day,

21:41.604 --> 21:43.432
but that's just because
my blender sucks.

21:44.912 --> 21:46.957
Oh, uh, hey there.
Nice ombré.

21:52.398 --> 21:55.749
This is Jeremy Chetri's phone
if this is Doc Holliday calling.

21:55.792 --> 21:58.360
Jeremy,
I know that you're there!

21:58.404 --> 21:59.579
And I'm not talking to you,

21:59.622 --> 22:02.756
so, uh, leave a message
after the never!

22:02.799 --> 22:06.542
Hey, Doc.
-Don't say hi to Doc.
He bit you!

22:06.586 --> 22:08.414
Look, Doc,
I'm not talking to you.

22:09.763 --> 22:12.766
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What do you mean, possessed?

22:23.907 --> 22:27.258
Okay, so much for Plan A,
B, C, D, E, F.
Any other ideas?

22:27.302 --> 22:28.956
Does he look kinda
familiar to you?

22:28.999 --> 22:30.871
Dude, even I've never been
that drunk.

22:30.914 --> 22:33.134
Oh! Oh, my God,
I knew getting back
into my research would pay off!

22:33.177 --> 22:34.222
That's One Armed Clint!

22:34.265 --> 22:36.093
-Okay, back in the day,

22:36.137 --> 22:38.966
Clint killed a miner
for his claim
and then hid out in this mine.

22:39.009 --> 22:41.664
Wyatt came to arrest him,
blew the mine to force him out,

22:41.708 --> 22:43.318
and then Clint got trapped!

22:43.362 --> 22:46.408
Super-great history
lesson, Waves.
That guy has two arms.

22:46.452 --> 22:48.932
-Mm-hmm.

22:48.976 --> 22:51.544
-That right arm, it's not his.

22:51.587 --> 22:52.936
It's Bulshar's.

22:54.460 --> 22:57.288
Damn, Two Arm Clint.

22:59.639 --> 23:02.859
-Ah, Jeremy. Thank God.
-Okay, I am here for her,
not for you,

23:02.903 --> 23:05.209
and I like your new shirt.
Dammit.

23:05.253 --> 23:07.429
D'you guys think
this is natural?

23:07.473 --> 23:10.693
Oh! Maybe I'll give her
a pixie cut.

23:10.737 --> 23:14.958
Oh, and look! Copper's down
with Victoria's Secret!

23:15.002 --> 23:18.658
Mattie and Gretta
had catalogues.

23:23.750 --> 23:26.796
Oh, I was hoping
for broader shoulders,

23:26.840 --> 23:29.669
but your eyebrows are on fleek.

23:29.712 --> 23:32.846
Just because I have a thin
frame doesn't mean I don't have
definition under here.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.460
Oh, ho.

23:38.504 --> 23:40.462
Oh...

23:40.506 --> 23:44.118
Mm... Mm. Okay. Okay.

23:44.161 --> 23:47.164
Wow. What do you know.
The kid does own a Shake Weight.

23:47.208 --> 23:52.039
What is happening...
to my shirt?

23:52.082 --> 23:54.345
Whoa. Whoa, whoa!

23:54.389 --> 23:56.870
Oh! God! Ah! It itches!

23:56.913 --> 24:00.003
-Hey, hey, listen.

24:00.047 --> 24:01.701
Maeve,
this is not your new body.

24:01.744 --> 24:05.531
Yeah, no kidding!
I need someone more pure.

24:05.574 --> 24:08.185
As in... purely human.

24:09.491 --> 24:10.753
-Ah!

24:10.797 --> 24:14.322
-Oh, God. Your loss, lady.
-Argh!
-Oh, God.

24:15.323 --> 24:16.759
-Jeremy.
-Yeah.

24:20.633 --> 24:24.245
Just so you know,
he does not like you
very much right now.

24:25.202 --> 24:26.900
Okay, how do we even know
she has the journal?

24:35.561 --> 24:37.867
Okay, this is gross.

24:37.911 --> 24:40.609
-Crap! I'm all outta bullets!

24:40.653 --> 24:42.872
-Well...

24:42.916 --> 24:44.483
Oh, shit.

24:44.526 --> 24:46.528
-Gonna have to "dark-alley
date-rapist" this dude.

24:46.572 --> 24:49.444
-Ah!!!

24:49.488 --> 24:51.838
: What happened?!

24:51.881 --> 24:55.189
What happened?!
Oh! Holy Hiroshima!

24:55.232 --> 24:57.539
I was right again!
Dude is radioactive!

24:57.583 --> 25:01.151
-Ugh! Congrats.
-Oh, my God!
-There is no prize.

25:01.195 --> 25:04.546
Unless you have any idea
on how to kill a Revenant
we can't touch.

25:04.590 --> 25:08.028
-Uh, we're definitely gonna need
more keys.

25:08.071 --> 25:10.465
-Pfft...

25:10.509 --> 25:11.858
-And also...

25:17.559 --> 25:19.779
Oh, God, he's coming!
Eventually.

25:19.822 --> 25:22.608
-Turtle race to the death.

25:22.651 --> 25:24.740
Oh. Oh!! No signal!!

25:24.784 --> 25:26.786
-No signal!

25:26.829 --> 25:30.441
-Ten miles at least.

25:30.485 --> 25:33.575
-I'll never make it.
-We have nothing left
to stop him with, so...

25:33.619 --> 25:36.926
What about this?
You melted
a demon jeweller's face!

25:36.970 --> 25:38.885
No, but I don't know
how I did it!

25:38.928 --> 25:41.844
You just... wanted to
and you touched him
and you did--

25:41.888 --> 25:45.413
Yeah, but I can't touch Clint!
Remember? He's toxic!

25:45.456 --> 25:47.589
-Oh, look. Gardner House.

25:47.633 --> 25:49.548
It's not far from here.

25:49.591 --> 25:50.984
-Yes.

26:05.041 --> 26:08.175
-You can put that down.
-Nope.

26:08.218 --> 26:10.917
No, I'm-I'm-I'm watching you.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.440
Got my orders.

26:12.483 --> 26:15.486
You've had your eyes closed
for the last 10 minutes...

26:16.444 --> 26:17.880
listening.

26:17.924 --> 26:18.751
What are you listening to?

26:22.972 --> 26:25.322
-It's jazz.
-I like avant-garde.

26:26.976 --> 26:28.412
The more experimental,
the better.

26:30.458 --> 26:33.330
I get it.
So if I let you listen,
open the door--

26:33.374 --> 26:35.681
Don't open the door.

26:38.074 --> 26:39.075
So who is it?

26:39.946 --> 26:42.426
Sun Ra

26:42.470 --> 26:44.646
-Oh, uh, no,
it's, uh, Colin Stetson.

26:44.690 --> 26:47.867
-Colin...
-Yeah, the song is called
Like Wolves on the Fold?

26:48.868 --> 26:49.695
I dig wolves.

26:55.396 --> 26:56.615
Maybe you'll dig this.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.632
Saxophone.

27:18.811 --> 27:20.247
The devil's horn.

27:23.990 --> 27:24.686
No.

27:25.818 --> 27:27.341
That wasn't made in hell.

27:27.384 --> 27:30.083
Uh, no, not in hell.
It's, uh, Montreal.

27:30.126 --> 27:31.258
He's from Montreal.

27:34.391 --> 27:37.612
You see,
the problem with humans...

27:39.527 --> 27:40.963
...is that sometimes...

27:44.488 --> 27:45.446
...sometimes...

27:46.621 --> 27:49.450
...you make
truly beautiful things.

27:52.888 --> 27:54.150
I can't figure it out, Bobo.

27:54.194 --> 27:57.284
Are you... a good guy,
or a bad guy?

28:00.809 --> 28:02.202
Can we listen some more?

28:03.159 --> 28:04.639
Just for a little while.

28:04.683 --> 28:05.640
Sure.

28:17.739 --> 28:21.787
Definitely from the late
nineteenth century.

28:21.830 --> 28:23.702
Smells like horse
and everything.

28:23.745 --> 28:26.661
-Yep.
-Maeve. Where is the rest
of that journal?

28:27.618 --> 28:28.968
-I dunno.
-Cough it up.

28:29.011 --> 28:30.926
Actually, for Nicole's sake,
maybe don't.

28:30.970 --> 28:32.972
No, I don't think
I'm gonna do that.

28:33.015 --> 28:36.192
Unless you're ready...

28:36.236 --> 28:38.934
to give me this body!!

28:38.978 --> 28:40.893
This is not a negotiation.

28:40.936 --> 28:45.071
Give me this scarlet Madonna,
or get the hell outta my crib!!!

28:45.114 --> 28:46.942
-What did you do
to get her so peeved?

28:48.378 --> 28:50.772
She's a teenage ghost witch!

28:50.816 --> 28:52.121
Okay.

28:52.165 --> 28:53.688
Come on, vampire.

28:53.732 --> 28:57.779
Her blood is so sweet,
I can sense it!

28:57.823 --> 29:00.651
Just one little bite?

29:01.652 --> 29:04.786
Yeah, Doc doesn't bite
his friends! Anymore.

29:04.830 --> 29:08.137
Then you'll never get
your hypocritical hands
on that book!

29:08.181 --> 29:10.531
I'm gonna burn it.

29:10.574 --> 29:13.403
How could you burn it
with no body?

29:17.364 --> 29:19.018
-Yes!
-No! No!

29:20.628 --> 29:23.936
-Oh, God, no!
Please don't arrest me
for this later, Nicole!

29:23.979 --> 29:27.374
-Ooh! You're deceptively strong.
-Yeah, I told you!

29:27.417 --> 29:28.201
: Ah! Ah! Ah!

29:29.855 --> 29:32.205
-This is it!
This is Juan Carlo's journal.

29:33.380 --> 29:34.555
Oh!

29:34.598 --> 29:36.035
You're not getting out of here
alive.

29:36.078 --> 29:38.820
Well, then you'll never get
your freshly killed body.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.735
Oh, I might.

29:44.739 --> 29:48.438
What good is a new body
with a hole in the head?

29:48.482 --> 29:49.875
Yeah, I mean,

29:49.918 --> 29:51.659
you can't walk around like that.

29:51.702 --> 29:54.662
Your... sunglasses
would sit crooked.

29:55.837 --> 29:58.274
-I don't know.
-Then you two...

29:58.318 --> 30:00.233
get nothing!!!

30:04.890 --> 30:05.586
Nicole?

30:09.068 --> 30:10.373
Ow.

30:10.417 --> 30:11.113
Listen.

30:12.506 --> 30:15.074
This book needs to get back
to BBD.

30:15.117 --> 30:17.990
I will torture you
with apologies along the way.

30:22.298 --> 30:23.343
We're toast.

30:27.129 --> 30:28.391
Mercedes!

30:28.435 --> 30:29.958
: Your face!

30:30.002 --> 30:33.570
-My freakin' face!
-It's, like, totally better!

30:33.614 --> 30:36.660
-Girl, you look fine as hell!
-And you look less pregnant.

30:36.704 --> 30:39.838
-Oof. We're all doing so great.
-Mm. Except there's a demon
following you.

30:41.361 --> 30:44.277
-A radioactive one.
-Oh, come! Come in! Come.

30:56.898 --> 30:58.639
-Come on, let's go, go, go!
-Yeah, yeah.

31:01.816 --> 31:04.514
Possible trapped victims.
Initiating primary search.

31:07.256 --> 31:09.650
I'll go in the back.
You two take the front.

31:09.693 --> 31:12.435
-We're on it.
-Hold tight, guys.
We're coming for you.

31:13.306 --> 31:15.351
-You did this, kid.

31:15.395 --> 31:18.311
You're... you're saying
I healed your face?

31:18.354 --> 31:20.487
You called me beautiful.
You touched me.

31:20.530 --> 31:23.229
Above the belt, though, right?
Such a ginger fetish.

31:23.272 --> 31:26.928
And then the next thing I know,
boom, I'm me.

31:26.972 --> 31:30.105
What...

31:30.149 --> 31:32.412
Don't know, don't care.
It really is a miracle, though.

31:32.455 --> 31:35.284
: Oh...
-Well, you'd better run,

31:35.328 --> 31:37.417
unless you want your face
to get a serious chemical peel.

31:37.460 --> 31:39.506
-I do not.
-No.

31:39.549 --> 31:41.203
-Incoming.
-Oh.

31:48.036 --> 31:49.342
: Ah!
-You!

31:50.647 --> 31:52.780
-No!

31:56.392 --> 31:59.265
Waverly, I love you,
and I know you don't know
how to work that thing.

31:59.308 --> 32:00.614
: Ah!

32:00.657 --> 32:02.224
-But you're gonna have to try!
-Oh, God, okay!

32:03.138 --> 32:04.835
Time to render you armless!

32:04.879 --> 32:06.359
-Good one!
-Thanks.

32:08.361 --> 32:10.537
-Ow, ow, ow! It didn't work!

32:10.580 --> 32:13.627
Sorry! I'll never make you
do that again!

32:27.989 --> 32:31.427
-Sorry! This was not my idea!

32:31.471 --> 32:33.952
-I'll twist this thing off
if I have to!

32:35.214 --> 32:39.479
Argh! You found me!
Now do something,
you useless piece of junk!

32:39.522 --> 32:40.959
What the...?

32:43.135 --> 32:46.399
The ring controls the arm!
It's like playing Wii!

32:46.442 --> 32:48.967
I'm really good at Wii!
Oh! Uh...

32:56.539 --> 33:00.195
Choke-out! Badass!
Aw. That was...

33:11.641 --> 33:14.557
The arm is mine.

33:14.601 --> 33:16.603
-'Cause... he was in a mine.

33:16.646 --> 33:18.387
-Yeah!
-High-five.

33:18.431 --> 33:20.607
-Okay.

33:20.650 --> 33:22.261
-I'm alright!

33:22.304 --> 33:24.654
Yank! Come on,
yank like you don't...

33:25.916 --> 33:28.354
-Yeah.
-Oh my God!

33:29.920 --> 33:30.660
Gross.

33:32.184 --> 33:33.620
I knew you could control
that thing.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.884
I... still don't know how.

33:39.060 --> 33:41.062
I never get sick
of being right.

33:50.854 --> 33:53.031
You need to lay off
those pretzels, old man.

34:07.610 --> 34:09.351
-You're alright.
-Yes.

34:10.222 --> 34:13.703
-Yes. You will save me...
-Yeah, I saved you.
Exactly. Exactly.

34:22.147 --> 34:23.626
I'm impressed.

34:23.670 --> 34:27.108
Honestly, I thought I'd be
mopping up Earp goo for sure.

34:27.152 --> 34:30.329
I passed your dumb test.
Now how do I use this thing
to kill Bulshar?

34:30.372 --> 34:35.334
Well, now, here's the thing,
pretty ladies.
The arm isn't the weapon.

34:35.377 --> 34:37.727
!
-You better be joking,

34:37.771 --> 34:39.555
or you better have
really good health insurance.

34:39.599 --> 34:41.905
-Okay, calm down.
-I am sick and tired
of your shit.

34:41.949 --> 34:44.299
I have proven myself
time and time again,

34:44.343 --> 34:46.301
and you would know that
if you'd been doing your job
properly.

34:46.345 --> 34:48.260
She used her gifts
and passed the trial.

34:49.174 --> 34:52.438
-Because now I know
that Mercedes's claim is true.

34:52.481 --> 34:53.917
A miracle did happen.

34:57.225 --> 34:58.357
And you...

35:02.143 --> 35:02.839
...are the one.

35:04.363 --> 35:05.146
The champion.

35:13.154 --> 35:15.156
: Doc!

35:15.200 --> 35:18.028
-Nicole!
-Oh, thank God you're okay!
Here. I got it, I got it.

35:18.072 --> 35:18.899
Nicole.

35:27.299 --> 35:28.691
What did you do?

35:30.084 --> 35:31.390
I retrieved the book.

35:34.306 --> 35:36.438
What did you do, Doc?!!

35:36.482 --> 35:38.136
The fire was too much.

35:41.965 --> 35:42.749
For him?

35:43.619 --> 35:44.664
Or for you?!

35:47.623 --> 35:51.192
-You killed him.
-You don't understand
what it's like.

35:51.236 --> 35:52.150
The hunger.

35:53.368 --> 35:54.978
The way it feels.

35:55.022 --> 36:00.158
I know that I am the only one
who volunteered to handle you!

36:00.201 --> 36:02.551
I know that I'm the last friend
that you had!!

36:15.912 --> 36:17.958
If I ever see you again,
John Henry...

36:19.916 --> 36:21.222
...I will kill you.

36:37.934 --> 36:40.459
-Hey.
-Oh, shit.

36:52.862 --> 36:55.474
Okay, so what do you mean,
that Waverly's the champion?

36:55.517 --> 36:58.085
That ring on your finger:
Bulshar stole it
from your father.

36:58.128 --> 37:00.870
So we know
neither of them had taste.

37:00.914 --> 37:04.134
Also... Julian and Bulshar
knew each other?

37:04.178 --> 37:06.311
They were the original haters.

37:06.354 --> 37:08.269
You are the daughter
of one of two angels

37:08.313 --> 37:10.880
tasked with protecting
the Garden: Juan Carlo--

37:10.924 --> 37:11.925
And Julian.

37:14.014 --> 37:14.623
Hmm.

37:15.972 --> 37:16.843
-Whew.
-Okay.

37:17.931 --> 37:20.977
So...
what does that make Bulshar?

37:21.021 --> 37:23.241
Juan Carlo says, and I quote:

37:23.284 --> 37:24.851
"Bulshar was created
in the Garden

37:24.894 --> 37:27.245
to enjoy the spoils
of Paradise."

37:27.288 --> 37:29.682
What does he mean
by "created in the Garden"?

37:29.725 --> 37:33.860
I don't know, but he, uh,
he says before Bulshar
was known as Sheriff Clootie,

37:33.903 --> 37:35.775
he took the form of a...

37:38.778 --> 37:40.693
Son-of-a-basilisk.

37:40.736 --> 37:42.912
-Thesnake.

37:42.956 --> 37:45.132
-Jesus Christ.
-Different book.

37:45.175 --> 37:46.176
: Bulshar's the snake!

37:48.004 --> 37:49.528
The snake from the Garden.

37:49.571 --> 37:50.920
As in:
The Last Temptation of Snake

37:50.964 --> 37:52.879
featuring special guest star
the Apple.

37:52.922 --> 37:54.576
Wow. Don't forget Eve.

37:54.620 --> 37:57.275
Ah. I wish I could.
Don't even get me started
on that girl.

37:58.406 --> 37:59.407
Bobo was right.

38:01.322 --> 38:04.456
-This isn't a demon's ring,
it's an angel's.
-Guys, I don't understand.

38:04.499 --> 38:06.066
It doesn't even have a diamond.

38:06.109 --> 38:07.894
And it found its way
back to you.

38:07.937 --> 38:10.157
We had to confirm you could
wield the power of the ring.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.333
You're only half-angel.
There's no precedent.

38:12.377 --> 38:15.293
Well, I...
I think I proved myself today.

38:15.336 --> 38:18.208
Yeah. Oh, and the other day,
with my face.

38:18.252 --> 38:21.429
Um, can you do other body parts?
Because I have a date tonight,

38:21.473 --> 38:23.910
and I went really hard
on the gelato while I was away.

38:23.953 --> 38:25.651
Waverly absolutely proved
herself.

38:25.694 --> 38:27.174
Which means
there's hope for us all.

38:27.217 --> 38:27.914
Oh!

38:29.742 --> 38:33.441
"We guarded the entrance
to keep him in,
to keep everything in.

38:33.485 --> 38:35.617
But we failed, Julian and I."

38:35.661 --> 38:38.185
Wait,
Julian as in Waverly's father.

38:38.228 --> 38:38.925
Yeah.

38:40.883 --> 38:44.496
"It has been a lifetime
since we had the chance
to right this wrong.

38:44.539 --> 38:47.629
And it will be another lifetime
until we can strike again.

38:47.673 --> 38:50.676
On this night,
and this night only,
we must stop him."

38:51.764 --> 38:52.678
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

38:54.114 --> 38:55.724
-I recognize this.

38:55.768 --> 38:59.075
This is the Blood Eclipse.
The pledge moon.

38:59.119 --> 39:01.208
Visible once every
120 years or so.

39:01.251 --> 39:03.689
-I minored in astronomy.

39:03.732 --> 39:06.909
With a Major in jazz history?
Are you too employable?

39:08.998 --> 39:10.348
Wait a minute. Wait.

39:11.914 --> 39:15.178
There's one happening soon.
Like... tomorrow soon.

39:16.136 --> 39:17.572
Then we better get ready.

39:19.182 --> 39:21.054
So what do I do
to stop Bulshar?

39:21.097 --> 39:23.578
You take your rightful place
on your father's throne.

39:25.188 --> 39:27.234
-The Garden gets sealed.

39:27.277 --> 39:30.498
-She saves the world.

39:31.891 --> 39:33.022
Just cut the shit!

39:35.851 --> 39:37.244
What's it gonna cost us?

39:40.813 --> 39:42.597
Her life. She'll turn to stone.

39:47.385 --> 39:50.344
No, she won't.
'Cause that is not gonna happen.

39:50.388 --> 39:54.522
But Waverly is the only thing
standing between humanity
and total annihilation.

39:55.654 --> 40:00.136
In the grand scheme of things,
isn't... one life kind of...

40:02.356 --> 40:03.618
Well, it's still mine.

40:03.662 --> 40:07.709
There's no goddamn way
I am sacrificing her.

40:07.753 --> 40:10.190
Well, it's not really up to you
anymore, is it?

40:14.237 --> 40:16.675
I don't...
I don't think I can do this.

40:19.504 --> 40:20.853
Wow.

40:20.896 --> 40:25.335
You selfish, shortsighted,
weak-willed millennials.

40:25.379 --> 40:27.250
You're gonna kill us all.

40:27.294 --> 40:30.210
I expected more from you.
And so would your father.

40:38.174 --> 40:41.308
Alright, Maeve...
you got your body.

40:41.351 --> 40:43.745
Now wake up!

40:43.789 --> 40:46.879
Nicole, hey, you can...
you can stand down.

40:46.922 --> 40:48.097
She's not in there.

40:49.316 --> 40:51.013
Why not?

40:51.057 --> 40:55.191
I... I don't know.
But the fire witch is gone.

40:56.454 --> 40:57.759
And so is Charlie.

40:59.848 --> 41:03.765
What are we gonna tell Wynonna?
What happened to Doc?

41:05.288 --> 41:06.725
I wish I knew.

41:08.770 --> 41:11.512
-If it's the only way
to stop Bulshar--
-It won't be.

41:11.556 --> 41:13.471
-If it was you
that could save us--
-I will.

41:13.514 --> 41:15.821
...you'd sacrifice yourself
in a heartbeat!

41:15.864 --> 41:17.518
In a heartbeat
to save the world.

41:17.562 --> 41:22.828
-To save me.
-Yeah. But this... this time,
this one time...

41:23.742 --> 41:25.395
...I'm gonna be selfish as hell.

41:27.833 --> 41:29.617
I've been through some shit,
baby girl.

41:32.838 --> 41:34.100
Some shit
that brought me so low,

41:34.143 --> 41:35.884
I didn't think I'd ever see
the light again.

41:40.019 --> 41:41.934
You're the only thing
that keeps me going.

41:43.892 --> 41:46.025
You're the light, Waverly.

41:46.068 --> 41:47.461
So I know it can't be true,

41:47.505 --> 41:50.203
'cause even my destiny
can't be this cruel.

41:51.421 --> 41:52.422
Come here.

42:04.478 --> 42:08.526
You've said it before
and I'll say it again.

42:09.831 --> 42:12.268
Being an Earp sucks balls.

42:20.189 --> 42:22.714
Waverly, it's 9 p.m.
in the middle of winter.

42:26.239 --> 42:28.241
Coming!

Ah, no-show.

42:38.120 --> 42:38.947
Not the face!!
