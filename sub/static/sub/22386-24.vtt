Hi, Ryder!

00:56.857 --> 01:00.492
Whoa, what a storm last night!

01:00.494 --> 01:01.660
Ah!

01:01.662 --> 01:02.661
And what a mess.

01:02.663 --> 01:05.898

We've got a lot of
cleaning up to do.

01:05.900 --> 01:06.698

Looks like Rubble's
already cleaning up.

That's Rubble on the gobble!

01:13.674 --> 01:15.507
(Laughing)

01:15.509 --> 01:17.743
I think he might be
sleepwalking, pups.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.411
Or sleep eating.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.479
(Laughing)

You were sleepwalking, Rubble.

01:32.593 --> 01:33.659
Oh-ho!

01:33.661 --> 01:35.928
Hope I didn't miss breakfast.

Oh, Rubble!

01:37.431 --> 01:38.530

Today's the big
Woof and Roll show.

01:41.035 --> 01:45.337
I can't miss Luke Stars'

01:54.381 --> 01:58.417
Oh, thank you for helping
clean up, Chicaletta.

01:58.419 --> 02:00.619
You are such a helpful
little chick!

02:00.621 --> 02:04.289
The Luke Stars' Woof and Roll
show starts soon.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.674

02:22.676 --> 02:25.844

but our fan-ness is huge!

02:28.516 --> 02:29.781
Uh, yeah, thanks, Mayor.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.783
I'm running a little late
because of the storm,

02:31.785 --> 02:35.320
but I can't wait to rock out
with Adventure Bay.

02:35.322 --> 02:36.421
<i> See you soon!</i>

(Clucking)

02:45.299 --> 02:46.632
Or something like that.

02:46.634 --> 02:49.434

Luke Stars!

03:01.715 --> 03:03.849
Mayor--
Can you believe it?

03:03.851 --> 03:06.818
He is as nice in person
as he seems on TV!

03:06.820 --> 03:07.853
Uh--
That voice!

03:07.855 --> 03:09.955
Oh, I could
listen to it all day!

03:09.957 --> 03:13.692
Mayor, uh, do you need
the PAW Patrol for anything?

03:13.694 --> 03:14.960
Oh, Ryder, yes!

03:14.962 --> 03:15.727
Yes, I do!

03:15.729 --> 03:18.130
The storm blew the equipment
all over the soccer field.

<i> There's no way this place</i>
<i> will be ready in time</i>

03:20.901 --> 03:22.434

03:22.436 --> 03:23.502
Yes it will, Mayor.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.948
Thanks for hustling, pups.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.016
Mayor Goodway needs help.

04:11.018 --> 04:15.254
The storm blew the equipment off
Luke Stars' concert stage.

04:15.256 --> 04:15.854
Oh, no!

04:15.856 --> 04:18.523
You mean Luke Stars
isn't coming?

04:18.525 --> 04:19.591
RYDER:
He's still coming,

04:19.593 --> 04:21.860
but we have to fix up the stage
before he gets here.

04:21.862 --> 04:26.531
Rubble, I'll need your truck and
crane to lift fallen lights.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.467
Rubble on the double!

04:28.469 --> 04:31.637
Rocky, I need
your forklift and tools

04:31.639 --> 04:33.672
to reassemble the bleachers.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.140
Green means go!

04:35.142 --> 04:37.843
And Chase, I need
your megaphone and cones

04:37.845 --> 04:40.946
to keep everyone organized
and safe until we're done.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.848

06:05.632 --> 06:08.333
Chase is on the case!

06:12.039 --> 06:14.473
Rocky, grab the bleacher seats

06:14.475 --> 06:16.575

<i> Skye, Zuma,</i>
<i> meet me at the old bridge.</i>

07:51.738 --> 07:53.305

08:03.750 --> 08:04.950
And, Marshall--

08:04.952 --> 08:05.617
Huh?

08:05.619 --> 08:08.420
You can head over here
and help finish the cleanup.

08:08.422 --> 08:09.955
I'm fired up!

08:09.957 --> 08:11.690
Whoa!

08:28.342 --> 08:28.974
Hi, Luke.

in no time.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.712
Luke Stars in person!

08:33.714 --> 08:35.347
And we get to save him!

08:35.349 --> 08:37.516
Skye, get ready
with your cable.

08:37.518 --> 08:38.183
Roger that!

08:38.185 --> 08:41.820
And Zuma, we'll use your dinghy
to carry Luke's equipment.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.436
Okay, Chase,

08:58.438 --> 09:00.205
make sure everyone
goes straight to their seats.

09:00.207 --> 09:03.675
No one goes backstage to bother
Luke before the concert.

09:03.677 --> 09:07.746
He won't have time for pictures
or autographs or anything.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.648
Ryder, the stage is almost
ready.

09:09.650 --> 09:10.649

<i> We're bringing everything</i>
<i> across now.</i>

09:12.719 --> 09:14.519
<i> It shouldn't be long.</i>

09:14.521 --> 09:16.721
Great!
See you soon.

09:17.591 --> 09:21.793
Oh, Chickaletta,
Luke Stars will be here soon!

09:21.795 --> 09:23.795
I can't wait to get his
autograph,

09:23.797 --> 09:26.631
and pictures with him,
and--

09:26.633 --> 09:27.532
Hi, Mayor Goodway.

09:27.534 --> 09:29.834
Follow these cones
to your seats.

09:29.836 --> 09:31.703
Oh, I'm just going
to wait backstage

09:31.705 --> 09:34.639
and get an autograph
and some pictures.

09:34.641 --> 09:39.077
I can't let anyone backstage.
Mayor's orders.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.345
But-- but I am the mayor.

09:40.347 --> 09:43.315
I just want to get two
or three or 30 little pictures

09:43.317 --> 09:46.084
with Luke, Chickaletta, and me.
Please?

09:46.086 --> 09:49.788
Sorry, but these paws
uphold the laws.

09:49.790 --> 09:52.290
Maybe after the show.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.492
Oh!

09:54.494 --> 09:56.861
(Chuckling)

10:00.634 --> 10:02.133

10:07.574 --> 10:10.008

10:11.712 --> 10:14.446
Got it, Ryder!

10:18.385 --> 10:19.384
(Cheering)

10:19.386 --> 10:21.953
Okay, Luke, your turn
for a ride.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.489
Can't wait!

10:26.026 --> 10:28.627
Thanks, Skye!

10:28.629 --> 10:32.697
Now we've got to get Luke
to the concert, fast.

10:40.607 --> 10:42.307
Ryder, how long
till you're here?

10:42.309 --> 10:43.575
<i> Be there soon, Mayor Goodway.</i>

10:43.577 --> 10:47.012
If only Chickaletta had
rehearsed her chicken dance.

10:47.014 --> 10:49.481
She could have kept everyone
entertained.

10:49.483 --> 10:54.819
Don't worry, I know what to do
until Ryder and Luke get here.

10:55.522 --> 10:56.488
(Applause)

10:56.490 --> 10:58.423
Hello, everyone!

10:58.425 --> 11:00.592
Luke Stars will be here soon,

11:00.594 --> 11:04.396
but until then,
put your hands together for

11:04.398 --> 11:07.932
Rubble and the PAW Patrol band!

11:07.934 --> 11:10.635
(Cheering)

11:10.637 --> 11:12.537
¶ A pup like me
likes a pup like you ¶

11:12.539 --> 11:16.908
¶ Whatever you are up to
is all I want to do ¶

11:16.910 --> 11:18.810
¶ I hear your bark ¶

11:18.812 --> 11:20.812
¶ Can't wait to see ¶

11:20.814 --> 11:24.416
¶ A pup like you,
you're the pup for me ¶

11:24.418 --> 11:29.721
¶ A pup like me ¶

11:30.090 --> 11:32.991
¶ A pup like me ¶

11:32.993 --> 11:38.363
¶ I'm a happy hound
whenever you're around ¶

11:38.365 --> 11:39.964
¶ A pup like me ¶

11:39.966 --> 11:43.935
¶ The happiest dog around ¶

11:53.480 --> 11:55.113
¶ Over hill, over dale ¶

11:55.115 --> 11:58.116
¶ Mayor Goodway's on the trail ¶

11:58.118 --> 12:01.986
Oh, it feels good
to stretch the legs,

12:01.988 --> 12:03.755
doesn't it, Chickaletta?

12:03.757 --> 12:05.123
Chickaletta?

12:05.125 --> 12:07.592
(Snoring)

12:09.563 --> 12:12.130
The climb up here was
rather tiring.

12:12.132 --> 12:16.935
Oh, but it's worth it to see
all the beautiful wildlife.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.671
Like butterflies, and--

12:19.673 --> 12:20.805
Oh, my!

12:20.807 --> 12:22.674
An eagle!

12:22.676 --> 12:24.976
She's protecting
her wittle baby!

12:24.978 --> 12:27.879
Like I protect my wittle
Chickaletta.

12:27.881 --> 12:31.116
Look at that cute little
fluttering butterfly

12:31.118 --> 12:34.753
fluttering by Chickaletta's
little beak.

12:34.755 --> 12:36.488
Aww.

12:36.490 --> 12:36.955
Oh!

12:36.957 --> 12:38.389
That's not a butterfly.

12:38.391 --> 12:39.958
That's a moth!

12:39.960 --> 12:42.694
Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo.
Go away now.

12:42.696 --> 12:44.329
Away you go. Away you go.

12:44.331 --> 12:47.799
Go away, flutter away now.
Away you go. Off, moth!

12:47.801 --> 12:49.367
(Clucking)

12:49.369 --> 12:51.870
Chickaletta!
Where are you going?

12:51.872 --> 12:55.306
(Clucking)

12:59.012 --> 13:01.679
(Clucking)

13:01.681 --> 13:03.948
(Snoring)

13:06.419 --> 13:07.719
Oh, no!

13:07.721 --> 13:10.722
Chicken overboard!

13:10.724 --> 13:13.658
Higher!

13:13.660 --> 13:15.727
Higher!

13:15.729 --> 13:17.562
Higher!

13:17.564 --> 13:20.932
(Laughing)

13:20.934 --> 13:23.067
It's my turn next.

13:23.069 --> 13:24.803
This pup's gotta fly!

13:24.805 --> 13:28.306
Well, I don't "gotta" fly.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.308
(Laughing)

13:30.310 --> 13:32.577
(Snoring)

13:32.579 --> 13:34.612
The PAW Patrol
will save the day.

13:34.614 --> 13:39.284
Stay calm, Chickaletta,
if you can!

13:43.957 --> 13:47.325
Whoops.
Not that switch.

13:48.895 --> 13:50.328
There. Fixed.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.730
(Phone ringing)

13:54.401 --> 13:55.700
Hello. Ryder here.

13:55.702 --> 13:58.303
I've got a bird emergency,
Ryder.

13:58.305 --> 13:59.771
Whoa.

13:59.773 --> 14:02.674
Poor Chickaletta was knocked
down the side of the hill!

14:02.676 --> 14:05.376
How did she get knocked
down the hill?

14:05.378 --> 14:06.911
Um, a moth did it.

14:06.913 --> 14:07.879
And that's not all.

14:07.881 --> 14:12.417
There a mommy eagle eyeing
my Chicky for snack time.

14:12.419 --> 14:13.551
(Eagle screaming)

14:13.553 --> 14:14.752
That is an emergency.

14:14.754 --> 14:19.424
No job is too big,
no pup is too small!

14:20.293 --> 14:22.760
PAW Patrol,
to the lookout!

14:22.762 --> 14:25.296
ALL:
Ryder needs us!

14:25.298 --> 14:27.398
Whoa!

14:27.400 --> 14:30.268
(Barking)

14:32.606 --> 14:34.472
Hey, where's Marshall?

14:34.474 --> 14:35.673
MARSHALL:
Rolling in!

14:35.675 --> 14:37.408
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:37.410 --> 14:39.043
SKYE:
Look out, Marshall!

14:39.045 --> 14:41.012
(Groaning)

14:41.014 --> 14:44.349
Look!
The PAW Patrol is in a roll.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.417
(Laughing)

15:00.867 --> 15:04.869
PAW Patrol, ready for action,
Ryder, sir!

15:04.871 --> 15:06.971
Thanks for coming so quickly,
pups.

15:06.973 --> 15:08.039
Chickaletta needs our help.

15:08.041 --> 15:12.076
She's in a backpack hanging from
a branch on the side of a cliff,

15:12.078 --> 15:13.945
and there's an eagle close by.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.546
<i> Chickaletta!</i>

15:15.548 --> 15:18.283
We've got to get her down
before the branch breaks.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.450
That eagle could be dangerous

15:19.452 --> 15:22.520
to small flying creatures
like Chickaletta.

15:22.522 --> 15:23.888
And me!

15:23.890 --> 15:24.923
Don't worry, Skye.

15:24.925 --> 15:26.858
For this rescue,
I need--

15:26.860 --> 15:28.026
Spy Chase.

15:28.028 --> 15:29.527
I need you and your winch

15:29.529 --> 15:31.796
to pull Chickaletta up to the
top of the cliff.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.398
<i>Hooray!</i>

15:33.400 --> 15:35.066
Spy Chase is on the case!

15:35.068 --> 15:39.304
Marshall, I need you below
with your truck and ladder

15:39.306 --> 15:41.806
in case Chickaletta falls.

15:43.410 --> 15:46.711
I'm ready
for a ruff ruff rescue!

15:46.713 --> 15:50.415
All right!
PAW Patrol is on a roll!

15:50.417 --> 15:52.684
(Barking)

15:54.421 --> 15:55.987
¶ PAW Patrol ¶

15:55.989 --> 15:59.290
(Barking)

15:59.292 --> 16:01.426
¶ PAW Patrol ¶

16:01.428 --> 16:02.560
(Laughing)

16:02.562 --> 16:04.729
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:04.731 --> 16:06.831
Whoa!

16:06.833 --> 16:11.970
¶

16:11.972 --> 16:13.571
¶ Chase! ¶

16:13.573 --> 16:14.806
(Barking)

16:14.808 --> 16:18.509
¶ Go, go, go, go! ¶

16:18.511 --> 16:20.912
¶ PAW Patrol ¶

16:20.914 --> 16:23.281
¶ Go, go, go, go! ¶

16:24.684 --> 16:25.984

16:25.986 --> 16:28.553

16:28.555 --> 16:30.455
¶ Go, go, go, go! ¶

16:30.457 --> 16:32.890
¶ PAW Patrol, PAW Patrol ¶

16:32.892 --> 16:36.461
(Tires screeching)

16:40.367 --> 16:44.802
(Sirens wailing)

16:53.913 --> 16:57.015
Okay, Marshall, take the
road down below the cliff.

16:57.017 --> 16:59.684
Chase and I will head up
to Mayor Goodway.

16:59.686 --> 17:03.554
You got it, Ryder!

17:10.897 --> 17:13.531
(Eagle screaming)

17:13.533 --> 17:16.034
That eagle doesn't sound happy.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.769
Good thing Skye's not here.

17:17.771 --> 17:21.339
Hearing that eagle wouldn't make
her happy either.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.408
Chase, Ryder!
Hurry!

17:23.410 --> 17:26.644
Poor Chickaletta
is so worried!

17:26.646 --> 17:28.913
(Snoring)

17:30.517 --> 17:32.950
Don't worry, the PAW Patrol
is here.

17:32.952 --> 17:33.985
Chase, lower your winch.

17:33.987 --> 17:36.921
We'll hook the backpack
to make sure it doesn't fall.

17:36.923 --> 17:39.390
Yes sir, Ryder!

17:39.392 --> 17:41.793
(Barking)

17:44.764 --> 17:47.832
(Barking)
Winch!

17:51.738 --> 17:55.273
Let's hook ourselves a chicken.

17:55.275 --> 17:59.243
CHASE:
Right on target, Ryder!

18:00.814 --> 18:01.979
Oh, my!

18:01.981 --> 18:03.614
Uh-oh.

18:07.020 --> 18:08.853
Marshall, climb up to
Chickaletta

18:08.855 --> 18:11.689
and secure the backpack
to the winch line.

18:11.691 --> 18:12.790
On it, Ryder!

18:12.792 --> 18:15.760
(Barking)
Ladder up!

18:15.762 --> 18:19.363
And Marshall up!

18:19.599 --> 18:23.367
Hi, Chickaletta.
We'll have you safe in no time.

18:25.071 --> 18:27.939
Backpack is all hooked up,
Chase!

18:27.941 --> 18:31.642
(Barking)
Up, winch!

18:38.685 --> 18:39.517
Chickaletta!

18:39.519 --> 18:42.553
MARSHALL:
I got her!

18:42.555 --> 18:44.455
Whoa!

18:47.260 --> 18:49.794
Chicken has landed!

18:49.796 --> 18:50.661
(Laughing)

18:50.663 --> 18:53.498
Chickaletta,
that tickles!

18:53.500 --> 18:55.867
(Cheering)

18:55.869 --> 18:58.002
Marshall, you're a hero!

18:58.004 --> 19:01.005
Great job, Marshall.
Come on up!

19:01.007 --> 19:03.407
(Laughing)

19:06.646 --> 19:07.512
Sweetums!

19:07.514 --> 19:09.514
Oh, you're safe and sound!

19:09.516 --> 19:10.715
(Eagle screaming)

19:10.717 --> 19:11.716
Chickaletta's all right,

19:11.718 --> 19:13.918
but something's wrong
with that eagle.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.019
(Screeching)

19:15.021 --> 19:17.922
She doesn't sound happy.

19:21.027 --> 19:23.728
Uh-oh, pups.
We've got another problem.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.796
The mother eagle
got tangled in twine

19:25.798 --> 19:26.931
and is caught in her nest.

19:26.933 --> 19:30.034
A mother who can't fly
to feed her baby.

19:30.036 --> 19:30.935
That is an emergency!

19:30.937 --> 19:33.671
We need a pup to get up here
and free that eagle.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.072
She's not going to like it.

19:35.074 --> 19:38.843
I know, but that eagle
needs Skye's help.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.384
<i> Skye! I need your help.</i>

19:46.386 --> 19:47.218
You got it, Ryder!

19:47.220 --> 19:49.020
RYDER:
<i> An eagle is tangled</i>
<i> with twine.</i>

19:49.022 --> 19:51.589
<i> She can't fly</i>
<i> or leave her nest.</i>

19:51.591 --> 19:52.757
<i> You have to free her.</i>

19:52.759 --> 19:54.892
The eagle?
(Gulping)

19:54.894 --> 19:57.528
Okay.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.597
(Barking)
Wings!

19:59.599 --> 20:03.000
This puppy's gotta fly!

20:09.909 --> 20:12.944
(Eagle screeching)

20:12.946 --> 20:14.812
(Barking)

20:17.417 --> 20:18.783
Okay, Ryder, I'm here.

20:18.785 --> 20:21.552
This is tricky, Skye,
but you can handle it.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.455
See the twine
on the eagle's foot?

20:24.457 --> 20:26.023
SKYE:
I see it!

20:26.025 --> 20:27.959
She's snagged on the nest!

20:27.961 --> 20:29.727
We have to help her get free.

20:29.729 --> 20:30.795
Think you can get it?

20:30.797 --> 20:32.663
I think I have to!

20:32.665 --> 20:33.965
Careful, Skye!

20:33.967 --> 20:35.299
(Barking)

20:35.301 --> 20:37.835
(Screeching)

20:37.837 --> 20:38.769
Oh, dear.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.371
(Whimpering)

20:40.373 --> 20:41.906
(Screaming)

20:41.908 --> 20:44.742
(Chirping)

20:44.744 --> 20:46.577
(Screeching)

20:46.579 --> 20:47.578
Whoa!

20:47.580 --> 20:49.013
Skye!

20:50.850 --> 20:51.716
Okay, new plan.

20:51.718 --> 20:54.118
Chase, use your spy drone as a
distraction.

20:54.120 --> 20:57.054
Keep the eagle busy so
Skye can fly in.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.422
(Howling)

20:58.424 --> 20:59.857
Great idea, Ryder!

20:59.859 --> 21:02.560
Spy Chase is on the case!

21:02.562 --> 21:04.829
(Barking)
Drone!

21:06.599 --> 21:09.267
(Barking)
Launch!

21:10.637 --> 21:13.471
(Chirping)

21:16.009 --> 21:19.076
(Screeching)

21:19.078 --> 21:20.645
Here's your chance, Skye!

21:20.647 --> 21:23.381
Okay, here I go!

21:25.585 --> 21:27.451
Yes! Woo-hoo!
All right!

21:27.453 --> 21:29.553
You did it, Skye.
The eagle is free.

21:29.555 --> 21:31.956
You and your pups
are amazing, Ryder.

21:31.958 --> 21:32.757
Thanks.

21:32.759 --> 21:34.692
Whenever you're in trouble,
just--

21:34.694 --> 21:35.826
(Eagle Screaming)

21:35.828 --> 21:36.560
for help!

21:36.562 --> 21:38.996
Wait, the eagle is free?
My drone!

21:38.998 --> 21:40.965
Better get it out of there,
Chase.

21:40.967 --> 21:44.268
You too, Skye.
Come down to safety.

21:48.541 --> 21:50.708
(Screaming)

21:59.385 --> 22:01.919
(Screaming)

22:01.921 --> 22:03.788
Skye, are you okay?

22:03.790 --> 22:04.655
I'm fine, Ryder.

22:04.657 --> 22:07.024
Just doing a little
birdwatching.

22:07.026 --> 22:08.592
(Chirping)

22:08.594 --> 22:10.528
She's so cute.

22:10.530 --> 22:11.629
Cute?

22:11.631 --> 22:13.864
(Laughing)

22:13.866 --> 22:15.733
(Chirping)

22:19.539 --> 22:20.338
ALL:
Aww!

22:20.340 --> 22:21.972
Looks like everyone's okay,

22:21.974 --> 22:23.741
thanks to you good pups.

22:23.743 --> 22:25.676
Let's get back to the lookout.

22:25.678 --> 22:28.312
All right!

22:28.314 --> 22:29.647
Thanks, Ryder.

22:29.649 --> 22:32.216
No problem.

22:32.452 --> 22:37.922
Chickaletta, you never thanked
those brave pups for saving you.

22:39.525 --> 22:44.528
