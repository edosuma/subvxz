WEBVTT

00:17.184 --> 00:20.754
I'd say we are like best friends.

00:20.821 --> 00:23.957
<i>We share the same room.</i>
<i>We are roommates.</i>

00:24.358 --> 00:27.761
<i>We encourage each other</i>
<i>when times are tough.</i>

00:32.633 --> 00:35.202
-Go!
-Korea!

00:42.442 --> 00:43.443
Korean Kim Yunhwan!

00:43.510 --> 00:46.246
<i>My older brother</i>
<i>will make it to the final with me,</i>

00:46.313 --> 00:48.515
but it's going to be me
that wins the final match,

00:48.582 --> 00:49.850
<i>and my brother will lose.</i>

00:49.917 --> 00:51.418
Kim Yungyung!

01:33.627 --> 01:35.696
Go get 'em!

01:55.482 --> 01:58.785
I'm also excited to compete
against my brother.

01:58.852 --> 02:02.089
While my strength is speed,
my brother's strength

02:02.155 --> 02:05.425
is that he is physically
much stronger than me.

02:51.471 --> 02:53.073
He grabbed the top!

02:53.140 --> 02:55.942
Korean Kim Yunhwan!

03:18.532 --> 03:22.703
He is like Tarzan.

03:22.769 --> 03:24.972
He is better than Tarzan!

03:25.038 --> 03:29.476
He is better than the monkey
that is next to Tarzan.

04:42.249 --> 04:44.384
I feel really bad.

04:44.785 --> 04:49.456
I am not satisfied with my performance.

05:03.603 --> 05:09.142
Regardless of the size of the wave,
I tamed it. This is how I see this show.

05:09.609 --> 05:11.778
<i>The sea waves did not stop me.</i>

05:11.845 --> 05:13.513
No one will stop me.

05:25.725 --> 05:27.127
Rafa, we have the same name!

05:27.194 --> 05:29.129
Let's go! We're with you!

05:29.530 --> 05:31.365
I never thought
I'd be cheering for myself.

05:32.366 --> 05:34.701
And he looks like me, even physically.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.372
Oh, my goodness!

06:36.363 --> 06:39.099
My brother will make it
to the final round.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.601
And I will make it, too.

06:40.667 --> 06:43.804
<i>But my brother</i>
<i>is a bit weaker than I am,</i>

06:45.038 --> 06:48.208
so for the final match,
I will be the winner and he will fail.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.660
Look, look! I can fly!

07:51.939 --> 07:53.540
I'll go get 'em!

08:33.180 --> 08:35.249
I was more relaxed than him,

08:35.315 --> 08:37.184
so I think I did better than him.

10:16.550 --> 10:18.819
My friends call me "Little Machine."

10:18.885 --> 10:21.788
<i>I'm not very tall,</i>
<i>and people tend to underestimate me,</i>

10:21.855 --> 10:24.691
<i>but I have a lot of power when I want.</i>

10:40.073 --> 10:41.975
The Beast is too strong!

10:45.712 --> 10:47.915
Come on, Mexico!

10:54.587 --> 10:58.391
Please, Adrian. Grab that vine! Bite it!

10:58.458 --> 11:00.293
Do whatever you have to do,
but don't let go!

11:00.760 --> 11:04.097
This is the beginning,
but you're going to hear more about me.

11:27.587 --> 11:28.454
Banzai!

11:50.010 --> 11:52.112
Oh, but he did really well!

11:52.746 --> 11:55.716
Darn it. I should have grabbed it.

13:26.572 --> 13:27.974
Come on, Claudia!

13:38.618 --> 13:40.153
-No!
-Why, woman?

13:47.427 --> 13:49.729
As you know, in <i>Rocky</i>,

13:49.796 --> 13:52.332
there is a scene
where he drinks raw eggs.

13:52.398 --> 13:57.337
<i>I wanted to surpass Rocky,</i>
<i>so I even ate the egg shells.</i>

13:58.404 --> 14:01.908
But I don't recommend it.
I got sick afterwards.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.555
Oh, he fell!

14:15.621 --> 14:18.825
I thought I could make it.
I'm disappointed.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.379
Germany!

15:06.707 --> 15:08.942
Relax, because they are not out yet...

15:09.009 --> 15:11.411
Eight will make it to the next level.

15:11.478 --> 15:16.416
So there's still a chance he keeps going
in this episode.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.289
-He didn't make it and he fell.
-Why?

17:37.958 --> 17:40.027
<i>Now these Americans...</i>

17:40.092 --> 17:42.395
...are making fun of us to our face!

17:45.365 --> 17:47.935
Now we have to listen to this...

17:48.000 --> 17:51.437
Just because they're beating us,
we have to listen to this...

18:44.057 --> 18:47.461
And the energy I saved in Level 1,
I will use in Level 2.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.629
<i>The Beast will see what I'm capable of.</i>

19:21.795 --> 19:25.532
My mother doesn't like
to go see her doctor

19:25.599 --> 19:27.167
because of doctor bills.

19:27.234 --> 19:31.038
But whenever I get sick,
she gives me money to see a doctor.

19:31.104 --> 19:36.510
If I become the Beastmaster
and win $10,000,

19:36.577 --> 19:42.115
I will give my mother a call
and give her the money.

20:20.419 --> 20:22.321
You can do it!

20:22.389 --> 20:24.391
A little bit more!

20:24.458 --> 20:26.660
You got it.

20:31.465 --> 20:34.001
You got to be careful.

22:40.260 --> 22:42.963
It moved down faster than I thought.

22:44.164 --> 22:45.766
When I reached the top, I was surprised.

22:50.037 --> 22:52.472
Adrien, here we go!

22:52.539 --> 22:53.774
Germany!

23:37.116 --> 23:42.187
The next 20 points go to Bochum!

24:18.592 --> 24:22.663
Hold on!

24:27.401 --> 24:31.438
He had bad timing. As a mover,
you don't need timing, see...

24:31.505 --> 24:34.141
If he had a washing machine on his back,
he would have made it!

25:01.900 --> 25:04.870
I practice several different sports.
So, I believe...

25:04.937 --> 25:08.140
...I will be a perfect athlete
for <i>Beastmaster.</i>

25:08.208 --> 25:09.376
<i>Brazil!</i>

25:25.190 --> 25:28.627
Unfortunately, Marcelo didn't make it.

25:55.454 --> 25:57.356
My legs were tired after the rotation.

25:57.656 --> 26:00.025
I could not put my legs forward
as I hoped.

26:12.204 --> 26:14.640
Once his hands touch,

26:14.708 --> 26:17.211
he'll be disqualified!

26:21.415 --> 26:24.151
What a shame, Adrian!

29:13.153 --> 29:15.889
Kim Yungyung!

31:12.306 --> 31:14.541
He landed! Good job!

31:14.608 --> 31:19.413
-Kim Yungyung!
-Kim Yungyung!

31:35.093 --> 31:37.796
-Use your legs.
-Just a little further.

31:43.969 --> 31:47.572
Yungyung Kim did it! He did it!

32:12.666 --> 32:18.772
The fact that I came this far...
I can be the Beastmaster!

32:18.839 --> 32:19.907
Thank you!

32:52.139 --> 32:56.343
In this group,
there are still two Japanese remaining,

32:56.410 --> 33:00.180
<i>so I think it would be nice and dramatic</i>

33:00.447 --> 33:03.717
if we both made it to the final round.

33:03.784 --> 33:07.855
Japanese are physically small
compared to other countries.

33:07.921 --> 33:10.724
<i>But even though my body's small,</i>

33:10.791 --> 33:14.595
I can win if I've got a big heart.
That's what I'm going to prove.

33:25.138 --> 33:27.074
He's our 20-year-old competitor.

33:40.452 --> 33:44.322
Placing second won't leave any impression.

33:44.391 --> 33:46.927
<i>I want to place first</i>
<i>and make my country famous.</i>

34:42.482 --> 34:45.018
Get outta here! Get outta here!

35:36.470 --> 35:37.905
I am shocked...

35:39.740 --> 35:42.843
...and at a loss for words.
Honestly a bit annoyed as well.

37:42.196 --> 37:44.932
Oh, no!
That's the trap of the Bungee Beds!

38:00.113 --> 38:02.583
It was going smoothly,
so I let my guard down.

38:03.617 --> 38:04.685
I'm disappointed.

40:48.549 --> 40:50.384
-Adrien!
-Adrien!

40:50.450 --> 40:53.253
-Adrien!
-Come on!

40:54.154 --> 40:57.958
I will collect all the points
that I can get.

40:58.022 --> 41:01.592
<i>Therefore, I will do my best</i>
<i>until my body is exhausted.</i>

41:12.105 --> 41:13.574
Germany!

41:22.814 --> 41:25.450
No!

41:34.058 --> 41:36.928
I have nothing to say.
I'll go bury my head in the sand.

44:32.873 --> 44:34.608
Yeah, yeah... Ouch!

44:46.186 --> 44:47.988
The second obstacle is really hard.

44:48.055 --> 44:49.756
There's nothing to grab onto.
