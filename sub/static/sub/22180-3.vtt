WEBVTT

00:01.553 --> 00:04.929
Before we return to the mat
for our next down dog,

00:04.993 --> 00:08.326
lets take a nice juicy
breath here in warrior two.

00:08.374 --> 00:12.278
Mm... ah...

00:12.279 --> 00:14.213
In the hustle and bustle of life,

00:14.214 --> 00:16.949
it is so easy to forget
what really matters,

00:16.950 --> 00:18.885
what's essential.

00:18.886 --> 00:21.988
And nothing is more
essential than breathing.

00:21.989 --> 00:23.888
Shut up.

00:26.659 --> 00:29.495
Senator Morejon, if your colleagues

00:29.496 --> 00:31.731
and President Dalton can't
come to some agreement

00:31.732 --> 00:33.900
on the budget, there will be

00:33.901 --> 00:35.768
a partial shutdown of
the federal government

00:35.769 --> 00:37.169
in a matter of days.

00:37.170 --> 00:40.072
Tens of thousands of
employees will be furloughed,

00:40.073 --> 00:43.309
and many important government
services will be reduced

00:43.310 --> 00:44.644
or halted altogether.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.812
Tell us why that would be
necessary, in your opinion.

00:46.813 --> 00:48.393
Look, no one wants a shutdown,

00:48.394 --> 00:50.716
least of all me, but the hard fact is,

00:50.717 --> 00:53.119
President Dalton is a spending addict.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.187
And, like any addict,
he needs an intervention.

00:55.188 --> 00:56.756
Shut up.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.357
Looks relaxing.

00:58.358 --> 01:01.661
I'm multitasking.
Women are famous for it.

01:01.662 --> 01:04.629
How's the meeting prep going?

01:04.631 --> 01:06.432
I'm numbing my feelings
with unhealthy substances.

01:06.433 --> 01:07.400
Men are famous for it.

01:07.401 --> 01:10.735
Oh, that sounds like a lot more fun.

01:12.071 --> 01:14.212
- You want to talk about it?
- There's no good way to spin it.

01:14.213 --> 01:16.776
What am I gonna say?
"Hey, Director Haymond,

01:16.777 --> 01:18.878
"you know that Russian kid
I stuck my neck out for?

01:18.879 --> 01:21.681
Turns out he's got a
drug problem. Whoops."

01:21.682 --> 01:26.919
On the other hand, Dmitri fooled a series

01:26.920 --> 01:28.621
of trained interrogators.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.957
You can't say he's not a good spy.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.158
Haymond doesn't strike me as

01:32.159 --> 01:34.727
a "glass half full" kind of guy.

01:34.728 --> 01:36.796
Well, he knows how messy
intelligence work can be.

01:36.797 --> 01:39.298
He'll appreciate you taking it to him,

01:39.299 --> 01:40.733
handling it like a grown-up.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.480
That, or he'll bounce
Dmitri out of the Agency,

01:42.481 --> 01:45.538
- and me along with him.
- More time to spend with the kids.

01:45.539 --> 01:48.874
You're really looking at the
bright side this morning, huh?

01:48.875 --> 01:50.443
Well, it beats brooding

01:50.444 --> 01:54.180
over the fact that this creep
wants to gut my department.

01:54.181 --> 01:57.416
Even if POTUS doesn't let him,

01:57.417 --> 01:58.618
I'll still probably have to furlough

01:58.619 --> 02:00.886
thousands of employees.

02:00.887 --> 02:03.856
Critical work all over
the globe will go undone,

02:03.857 --> 02:08.461
raising the likelihood of an
otherwise preventable disaster

02:08.461 --> 02:10.630
by, like, a thousand percent.

02:10.631 --> 02:13.432
Plus, I hate his dumb, stupid face.

02:13.433 --> 02:15.101
Well, at least you're
handling it like a grown-up.

02:15.102 --> 02:16.702
Hang in there.

02:16.703 --> 02:19.038
Yeah, you, too. I got to get dressed.

02:19.039 --> 02:21.540
- Call me after, will you?
- Yeah.

02:21.541 --> 02:22.508
Hey, that's...

02:22.509 --> 02:26.678
We all have feelings we have to eat.

02:27.613 --> 02:29.448
I'm still gathering recommendations

02:29.449 --> 02:32.485
from all departments, desks,
embassies and consulates

02:32.486 --> 02:35.554
on non-essential
personnel to be furloughed

02:35.555 --> 02:36.856
in the event of a shutdown.

02:36.857 --> 02:40.559
- That's fun.
- Oh, you have no idea.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.095
You know, all I can do
is follow the guidelines

02:43.096 --> 02:45.364
of the Office of Management and Budget,

02:45.365 --> 02:47.366
but people here are acting like I'm

02:47.367 --> 02:49.201
the great and powerful Oz.

02:49.202 --> 02:51.470
And I... Sorry.

02:51.471 --> 02:53.739
I will have a final
report to you shortly.

02:53.740 --> 02:55.574
- Okay.
- Um...

02:55.575 --> 02:59.745
oh, also, I had to move Daisy's
baby shower up to tomorrow.

02:59.746 --> 03:02.748
That's good... with the shutdown looming,

03:02.749 --> 03:04.116
I think it's better sooner than later.

03:04.117 --> 03:06.519
That's what I thought. There'll be cake,

03:06.520 --> 03:09.588
uh, champagne and sparkling cider.

03:09.589 --> 03:11.090
Oh, sparkling cider,

03:11.091 --> 03:13.893
the carob chips of beverages.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.327
Gifts?

03:15.328 --> 03:16.896
Uh, individual gifts are welcome,

03:16.897 --> 03:19.498
but we are pitching in to get her a crib.

03:19.499 --> 03:20.566
I invite you

03:20.567 --> 03:22.968
- to only $62.
- Noted.

03:22.969 --> 03:25.438
Hey, there's not gonna be
any baby games, are there?

03:25.439 --> 03:28.407
No. You think Daisy likes games?

03:28.408 --> 03:30.509
Deep down, it's my conviction that nobody

03:30.510 --> 03:33.112
normal likes baby shower games.

03:33.113 --> 03:35.614
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I like a good baby shower

03:35.615 --> 03:37.666
just like anybody else,
but I just can't stand

03:37.667 --> 03:40.953
- all the... frippery.
- Excellent word choice, ma'am.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.409
- I thought so.
- Good morning, ma'am.

03:42.410 --> 03:43.823
- Good morning.
- Jay is in your office,

03:43.824 --> 03:46.792
- ready to brief you on the overnight developments.
- Oh, good.

03:46.793 --> 03:48.494
Oh, and regarding Daisy's shower,

03:48.495 --> 03:52.298
I have some pretty lively
recommendations for games

03:52.299 --> 03:53.833
- that I think would be...
- She hates games.

03:53.834 --> 03:56.268
- Oh, uh...
- We all do.

03:56.269 --> 03:57.870
- But...
- I want to start

03:57.871 --> 04:01.173
with the riots at the
refugee camp in Lebanon.

04:01.174 --> 04:02.508
Regarding the 70-some-thousand

04:02.509 --> 04:04.210
Syrian refugees packed into this camp

04:04.211 --> 04:05.711
in the northern Bekaa Valley

04:05.712 --> 04:08.314
that's designed for
about half that number,

04:08.315 --> 04:11.239
tensions have been brewing,
and last night they boiled over.

04:11.240 --> 04:12.619
We have people on the
ground there, right?

04:12.620 --> 04:15.254
Yes, ma'am. There's a team
charged with bringing electricity

04:15.255 --> 04:16.488
to the camp, and they're fine.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.257
From what I've read, it sounds like

04:18.257 --> 04:21.127
lack of electricity is what's
underlying most of the issues

04:21.128 --> 04:22.428
that led to the riot.

04:22.429 --> 04:23.918
The whole place runs on generators,

04:23.919 --> 04:26.132
and fuel is expensive,
so it's dark at night.

04:26.133 --> 04:27.333
Then the criminals come out.

04:27.334 --> 04:30.102
Yeah, then the women are
terrified to leave the tent

04:30.103 --> 04:32.204
and go to the bathroom, which contributes

04:32.205 --> 04:34.073
to unsafe sanitation practices,

04:34.074 --> 04:35.040
which leads to cholera.

04:35.041 --> 04:36.075
Have they had an outbreak yet?

04:36.076 --> 04:38.177
Not yet, but it's a matter of time.

04:38.178 --> 04:40.312
Thousands of people crammed into a camp

04:40.313 --> 04:41.547
where not one feels secure.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.415
It's... It's a powder keg.

04:43.416 --> 04:44.784
So is Lebanon.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.652
If this camp melts down,

04:46.653 --> 04:48.521
whether it's due to disease outbreak

04:48.522 --> 04:51.123
or jihadis exploiting
the people's discontent,

04:51.124 --> 04:53.592
it wouldn't take much for
the whole country to blow up.

04:53.593 --> 04:55.928
The last thing we need
is another civil war

04:55.929 --> 04:57.129
in the Middle East.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.031
I want to talk to the
project manager on the ground.

04:59.032 --> 05:00.599
Let's get those lights turned on.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.368
And don't tell me that
they'll be furloughed

05:02.369 --> 05:03.435
if there's a shutdown.

05:03.436 --> 05:05.070
They are contractors,

05:05.071 --> 05:08.741
and, under the guidelines,
their activities

05:08.742 --> 05:10.276
are considered non-essential.

05:10.277 --> 05:11.277
Unbelievable.

05:11.278 --> 05:13.179
Deadline for budget negotiations

05:13.180 --> 05:14.346
is end of day tomorrow.

05:14.347 --> 05:17.364
After that, we're most
likely in shutdown mode.

05:17.365 --> 05:19.000
Well, then, we'd better work fast.

05:19.001 --> 05:21.854
So, what, exactly, do we do in there?

05:21.855 --> 05:24.023
Well, I take notes from Russell.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.958
You just sit quietly

05:25.959 --> 05:27.660
until he or I need anything.

05:27.661 --> 05:28.794
I can do that.

05:28.795 --> 05:30.262
Also, pretend to take notes,

05:30.263 --> 05:32.598
but really be watching
Morejon and his staffers.

05:32.599 --> 05:35.167
See how they're reacting,
write down your impressions.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.102
Russell might quiz you later.

05:37.103 --> 05:39.138
Wait, what? Oh, man.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.706
Look, I get it.

05:40.707 --> 05:42.608
You're in the room
everybody in the country

05:42.609 --> 05:43.642
is talking about.

05:43.643 --> 05:44.810
You want to do a good job.

05:44.811 --> 05:46.145
It's nerve-racking.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.780
But your biggest asset in there is that

05:47.781 --> 05:49.081
nobody thinks you matter.

05:49.082 --> 05:50.249
Got it?

05:50.250 --> 05:51.884
That's oddly reassuring. Thanks.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.091
Good morning, everyone.

05:53.092 --> 05:54.820
Please be seated.

05:58.390 --> 06:00.593
Let me start by saying that

06:00.594 --> 06:02.494
as much as we may disagree,

06:02.495 --> 06:03.896
we owe it to the American people

06:03.897 --> 06:05.831
to negotiate in good faith.

06:05.832 --> 06:09.101
I'm hoping we can do that this morning.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.770
With that in mind, have you, uh,

06:11.771 --> 06:14.907
had the opportunity to
review our latest proposal?

06:14.908 --> 06:17.743
We have indeed. Mm-hmm.

06:17.744 --> 06:20.913
A new auditing mechanism
for the Pentagon?

06:20.914 --> 06:24.450
Everyone in this room knows that
that is a political non-starter.

06:24.451 --> 06:26.485
They also know that if you really want

06:26.486 --> 06:28.687
to achieve significant
long-term savings,

06:28.688 --> 06:30.556
DoD's the place to start.

06:30.557 --> 06:34.126
No-bid, cost-plus contracts
for multibillion-dollar

06:34.127 --> 06:36.562
weapons systems the generals
aren't even asking for?

06:36.563 --> 06:39.265
I mean, come on, members
of your own caucus

06:39.266 --> 06:41.433
have complained about this for years.

06:41.434 --> 06:43.469
If we tackle this together, I'm confident

06:43.470 --> 06:45.638
that we can get the
deficit reductions you want

06:45.639 --> 06:49.441
and the clean continuing
resolution I want.

06:49.442 --> 06:50.843
With all due respect, Mr. President,

06:50.844 --> 06:54.313
I just don't see much
here to move the needle.

06:54.314 --> 06:56.315
Well, Senator,

06:56.316 --> 06:58.517
for the sake of the American people,

06:58.518 --> 07:01.085
I would encourage you to look harder.

07:03.000 --> 07:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:11.931 --> 07:14.500
I am not going to lie to you, Henry,

07:14.501 --> 07:17.369
- this looks pretty bad.
- And I take full responsibility.

07:17.370 --> 07:19.471
You understand a breach of
this kind is a firing offense.

07:19.472 --> 07:20.906
I do.

07:20.907 --> 07:22.274
But Dmitri was honest with me,

07:22.275 --> 07:24.777
and that speaks well of him...

07:24.778 --> 07:26.412
all things considered.

07:26.413 --> 07:27.746
And, obviously,

07:27.747 --> 07:29.448
he's an invaluable resource

07:29.449 --> 07:30.616
to our intelligence community.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.618
Arguably, he won a war for us.

07:32.619 --> 07:33.585
And, as you know,

07:33.586 --> 07:35.788
we're trying to thwart Russia's efforts

07:35.789 --> 07:38.023
in Afghanistan... he'll be
an important player in that.

07:38.024 --> 07:40.859
First we arm the mujahideen
to fight the Russians,

07:40.860 --> 07:43.295
now the Russians are
arming them to fight us.

07:44.364 --> 07:46.131
It's a hell of a business we're in.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.733
So, where's Petrov now?

07:47.734 --> 07:48.934
I ordered him to stay at home.

07:48.935 --> 07:50.569
I'm having him call in sick

07:50.570 --> 07:53.739
until we figure out our next steps.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.453
Well, here's the dirty
little secret that no one

07:55.454 --> 07:57.393
in the spy game wants to admit:

07:57.394 --> 08:00.512
this job takes a toll.

08:00.513 --> 08:02.915
You can ask any of my ex-wives.

08:02.916 --> 08:06.085
We have contingencies
for cases like Petrov's.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.620
I can get him a bed in a facility

08:08.621 --> 08:10.956
not far from here... very discreet.

08:10.957 --> 08:13.425
We'll get him cleaned
up and assess from there.

08:13.426 --> 08:14.460
Thank you.

08:14.461 --> 08:16.095
We'll keep this between us.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.796
You just come up with
some plausible reason

08:17.797 --> 08:20.132
he'll have to be off
the job for a few weeks.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.534
- Will do.
- But, Henry,

08:22.535 --> 08:27.339
if Petrov's issues come back to haunt us,

08:27.340 --> 08:30.442
I-if he compromises American
security in any way...

08:30.443 --> 08:33.544
It's on me.

08:33.546 --> 08:35.313
I understand.

08:35.315 --> 08:36.682
Oh, hi.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.317
I'm not allowed to talk about it.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.586
Of course not. Officially.

08:40.587 --> 08:42.187
But a heads-up among friends...

08:42.188 --> 08:44.857
It's mostly not even up to me.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.092
The OMB has set out strict guidelines...

08:47.093 --> 08:48.627
Mostly not up to you.

08:48.628 --> 08:50.547
Which means there's a
teeny bit that is up to you.

08:50.548 --> 08:52.364
I can work with that.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.700
No, no, no! I don't like lemon.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.869
Okay.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.871
Matt, Daisy, I am really sorry,

08:58.872 --> 09:03.542
but my hands are tied
by these guidelines.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.611
The best thing that could
happen for all of us...

09:05.612 --> 09:09.081
and by "us" I mean the United States,

09:09.082 --> 09:12.351
would be to avert this
shutdown altogether.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.586
Yep, that's what you say to somebody

09:14.587 --> 09:16.622
- who's about to get furloughed.
- Nadine...

09:16.623 --> 09:18.638
there's a personal
call for you on CONVYD.

09:18.803 --> 09:20.125
Not a moment too soon.

09:20.126 --> 09:21.960
Who is it?

09:21.961 --> 09:23.262
Your son, Roman.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.064
Oh. Thanks.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.066
Wait, so Nadine and her son

09:27.067 --> 09:28.167
are talking again?

09:28.168 --> 09:29.568
How should I know?

09:29.569 --> 09:30.869
Though I should probably call my mom,

09:30.870 --> 09:32.738
'cause I'm gonna have
to move back in with her.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.773
Uh...

09:34.774 --> 09:37.609
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, Roman. Hello, Shindy.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.411
- Hi, Nadine.
- Well,

09:39.412 --> 09:40.712
this is a nice surprise...

09:40.713 --> 09:42.181
Well, speaking of surprises,

09:42.182 --> 09:45.984
I'm glad you're sitting down because...

09:45.985 --> 09:47.853
you're gonna be a grandma!

09:47.854 --> 09:49.588
Real...

09:49.589 --> 09:52.091
Oh, well... Oh,

09:52.092 --> 09:54.560
that's wonderful.

09:54.561 --> 09:56.628
Oh, God, Shindy, how far along are you?

09:56.629 --> 09:59.064
Four months.

09:59.065 --> 10:01.500
I'm just so happy for both of you.

10:01.501 --> 10:03.506
But, Mom, we were also calling
because we actually need

10:03.507 --> 10:06.221
- a little favor.
- Oh, okay.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.606
So, what are the odds

10:07.607 --> 10:10.342
of getting the camp hooked up

10:10.343 --> 10:13.312
to the Lebanese power
grid in two days' time?

10:13.313 --> 10:15.781
Frankly, ma'am, not good at all.

10:15.782 --> 10:18.217
We've done our part.
The camp is good to go.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.852
But the Lebanese
government didn't calculate

10:19.853 --> 10:21.053
the capacity issues

10:21.054 --> 10:24.790
correctly, and their grid
is overtaxed as it is.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.558
We're trying to resolve the problem,

10:26.559 --> 10:28.393
but the bureaucracy here is

10:28.394 --> 10:30.095
fairly challenging.

10:30.096 --> 10:31.763
It's a complete nightmare.

10:31.764 --> 10:33.866
Well, I'll speak to
the Lebanese government

10:33.867 --> 10:35.400
at the highest level

10:35.401 --> 10:38.103
and see if I can't get this
straightened out for you.

10:38.104 --> 10:39.404
I appreciate that, ma'am.

10:39.405 --> 10:40.706
My team and I are willing to stay

10:40.707 --> 10:41.874
until the mission is complete.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.542
Even if there is a shutdown in D.C.

10:43.543 --> 10:46.211
Well, that is noble of you, Valerie,

10:46.212 --> 10:48.547
but I don't think That'll be possible.

10:48.548 --> 10:51.717
Permission to speak freely, ma'am.

10:51.718 --> 10:53.785
Go ahead.

10:53.786 --> 10:55.787
I started out in the
Army Corps of Engineers.

10:55.788 --> 10:57.623
Did tours in Afghanistan and Iraq.

10:57.624 --> 10:59.525
I noticed you received a
commendation for your service.

10:59.526 --> 11:00.759
Yeah.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.262
For building schools that
stayed empty in Kandahar

11:03.263 --> 11:05.497
until they were blown up by the Taliban.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.290
Clinics in Fallujah with
no doctors 'cause the money

11:08.291 --> 11:09.542
got siphoned off.

11:09.543 --> 11:11.837
I got into this line of work
to help people, you know?

11:11.838 --> 11:14.006
You wouldn't believe
what the folks around here

11:14.007 --> 11:15.140
have been through.

11:15.141 --> 11:17.910
In terms of engineering,
powering up this camp

11:17.911 --> 11:20.479
is complicated but completely feasible.

11:20.480 --> 11:24.115
It's just the politics;
it's always the politics.

11:26.485 --> 11:28.052
Apologies, ma'am.

11:29.594 --> 11:30.655
Long night.

11:30.656 --> 11:34.359
No, no, I appreciate your candor.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.962
I'm gonna do everything
I can to make this work.

11:36.963 --> 11:41.133
Meanwhile... you and
your team stay safe, okay?

11:41.134 --> 11:43.467
Will do, Madam Secretary.

11:50.442 --> 11:52.945
The purpose of government
is to manage core issues,

11:52.946 --> 11:54.446
not to create more government.

11:54.447 --> 11:55.944
This out of control
spending is imperiling

11:55.945 --> 11:56.881
our nation's future.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.817
Our CR gives the American people a signal

11:58.818 --> 12:01.486
that we understand that.

12:01.487 --> 12:02.554
That's the problem

12:02.555 --> 12:04.456
with this whole discussion, Senator.

12:04.457 --> 12:06.425
You're talking about signals.

12:06.426 --> 12:09.061
I'm talking about actual people's lives.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.698
Yes, Mr. President, you've been
moralizing at us all morning.

12:11.699 --> 12:14.132
Well, this has all been most

12:14.133 --> 12:16.935
illuminating.

12:16.936 --> 12:19.271
Let's circle back in the morning.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.439
Thank you.

12:25.611 --> 12:26.778
Any takeaways?

12:26.779 --> 12:29.781
Besides the fact that
POTUS's proposal is DOA

12:29.782 --> 12:32.618
and Morejon is even less likable

12:32.619 --> 12:34.586
in real life than he is on TV.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.189
Whenever Russell says
something is "illuminating,"

12:37.190 --> 12:39.591
what he's really saying
is that he doesn't like

12:39.592 --> 12:40.892
what's being illuminated.

12:40.893 --> 12:42.027
Meaning?

12:42.028 --> 12:43.095
Meaning he doesn't think

12:43.096 --> 12:45.297
Morejon is negotiating in good faith.

12:45.298 --> 12:48.333
If I were you, I'd start
calling some temp agencies.

12:48.334 --> 12:50.801
You're gonna need another job soon.

12:52.404 --> 12:59.305
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#FF0000"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#FF0000"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

13:04.529 --> 13:06.363
- Dr. McCord.
- Hi, Talia.

13:06.364 --> 13:08.599
Uh, what are you doing here?

13:08.600 --> 13:09.633
I'm looking for your brother.

13:09.634 --> 13:10.835
He's not answering his phone.

13:10.836 --> 13:12.970
You mean you don't
know where he is either?

13:12.971 --> 13:14.872
Wait, what are you talking about?

13:14.873 --> 13:16.340
When was the last time you saw him?

13:16.341 --> 13:18.476
Two days ago.

13:18.477 --> 13:19.443
Why didn't you call me?

13:19.444 --> 13:21.135
He told me he was going away for work,

13:21.136 --> 13:22.646
that it was secret

13:22.647 --> 13:24.081
and that you knew about it.

13:24.082 --> 13:25.704
He couldn't even bring his phone.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.351
He left it in his room.

13:27.352 --> 13:28.819
Are you telling me this isn't true?

13:28.820 --> 13:30.154
He's not on a mission.

13:30.155 --> 13:32.089
_

13:32.090 --> 13:34.225
If he lied to both of us,

13:34.226 --> 13:36.060
he could be shooting up heroin somewhere.

13:36.061 --> 13:38.833
I should have never let
him keep taking those pills.

13:38.834 --> 13:40.368
I shouldn't have helped him get them.

13:40.369 --> 13:41.319
- I...
- Stop it.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.978
- This is not your fault.
- Of course it is.

13:42.979 --> 13:44.332
Everything he did,

13:44.333 --> 13:45.432
everything he endured

13:45.433 --> 13:46.868
was for me.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.302
Th-This is how I repay him.

13:48.303 --> 13:49.471
- We'll find him, okay?
- How?

13:49.472 --> 13:52.641
We can't track his phone.
We can't call the police.

13:52.642 --> 13:54.176
He's been calling in
sick for work every day

13:54.177 --> 13:55.177
just like I asked.

13:55.178 --> 13:56.082
And believe it or not,

13:56.083 --> 13:57.812
calling in sick to
the CIA is not so easy.

13:57.813 --> 13:59.047
He's not using his own phone.

13:59.048 --> 14:00.248
At the very least, they'll have a record

14:00.249 --> 14:02.350
of the phone he's been calling from.

14:02.351 --> 14:04.118
We can start there.

14:05.721 --> 14:09.157
I would love to be able to tell
you we could connect the camp

14:09.158 --> 14:11.393
to our electrical grid within a few days,

14:11.394 --> 14:14.262
but, regrettably, it's
an impossible timeline.

14:14.263 --> 14:17.232
The electrification
project has been going on

14:17.233 --> 14:19.801
for six months, Mr. Ambassador.

14:19.802 --> 14:22.337
This is Lebanon we're talking
about, Madam Secretary,

14:22.338 --> 14:23.371
not Switzerland.

14:23.372 --> 14:26.174
Well, how about you at least try?

14:26.175 --> 14:28.843
So, you're browbeating me for
my government's dysfunction

14:28.844 --> 14:30.212
while yours is about to shut down?

14:30.213 --> 14:33.648
Fine. We're screwed up, too.

14:33.649 --> 14:36.051
You got me.

14:36.052 --> 14:38.753
Now can we talk about solutions?

14:38.754 --> 14:40.188
It seems to me

14:40.189 --> 14:44.658
you have two choices: buy
more time or buy more people.

14:46.361 --> 14:49.197
Meaning figure out a way
to keep my team on the clock

14:49.198 --> 14:51.967
or bribe the right guys in Lebanon.

14:51.968 --> 14:55.136
Not me, of course. I...

14:55.137 --> 14:57.572
want to help, Madam Secretary.

14:57.573 --> 15:00.308
I'm just paying you the
respect of being honest.

15:00.309 --> 15:03.578
Okay. More money.

15:03.579 --> 15:05.245
See what I can do.

15:06.948 --> 15:09.149
Thank you.

15:10.408 --> 15:13.956
Well, it wasn't their mistake,
sir, it was your mistake,

15:13.957 --> 15:16.359
so can you correct it or not?

15:16.360 --> 15:18.528
All right, so your answer,

15:18.529 --> 15:20.897
in so many words, is no.

15:20.898 --> 15:23.065
Got it. Yes. Thank you so much.

15:23.066 --> 15:24.667
Bad time?

15:24.668 --> 15:25.868
I can come back.

15:25.869 --> 15:28.171
No, it's fine. Please come in.

15:28.172 --> 15:30.873
Lower yourself onto my couch.

15:32.976 --> 15:35.069
My son, Roland, and
his girlfriend, Shindy,

15:35.070 --> 15:36.053
are gonna have a baby.

15:36.054 --> 15:37.980
- Hey, congratulations.
- Yeah. Thanks.

15:37.981 --> 15:39.448
I'm actually really thrilled about it.

15:39.449 --> 15:41.217
I'm just so annoyed

15:41.218 --> 15:42.285
it doesn't show.

15:42.286 --> 15:43.352
So, you and Roman are...

15:43.353 --> 15:45.888
Talking again, yeah.

15:45.889 --> 15:47.290
Yeah. Here and there.

15:47.291 --> 15:51.027
He just told me about the baby today.

15:51.028 --> 15:52.094
So, what was that call about?

15:52.095 --> 15:53.062
They're relocating

15:53.063 --> 15:55.198
to the Bay Area to have the baby.

15:55.199 --> 15:58.367
Uh, Roman got a job offer there.

15:58.368 --> 16:02.605
But apparently, Shindy's
name matches someone

16:02.606 --> 16:03.773
on the no-fly list.

16:03.774 --> 16:06.576
Well, doesn't sound so hard to clear up.

16:06.577 --> 16:08.978
But if I don't get this
resolved before the shutdown,

16:08.979 --> 16:11.147
then, by the time the shutdown is over,

16:11.148 --> 16:12.949
she may be too pregnant to fly.

16:12.950 --> 16:15.492
- What are you gonna do about it?
- I'm gonna hump it over

16:15.493 --> 16:18.187
to Homeland Security and
plead the case in person.

16:18.188 --> 16:20.523
The things we do for love.

16:20.524 --> 16:22.425
Anyway...

16:22.426 --> 16:24.527
what's up?

16:24.528 --> 16:26.662
So, um...

16:26.663 --> 16:27.730
about the shutdown...

16:27.731 --> 16:30.199
- Oy.
- I know, I know.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.717
Just don't let them furlough
me because I'm pregnant, okay?

16:32.718 --> 16:33.836
They won't say that's why,

16:33.837 --> 16:34.804
but That'll be why.

16:34.805 --> 16:35.938
You should be so lucky.

16:35.939 --> 16:38.174
You could sue and never
have to work again.

16:38.175 --> 16:39.742
Yeah, well, I want to work.

16:39.743 --> 16:41.043
My career is important to me.

16:41.044 --> 16:43.846
I mean, I'm just gonna
take a couple weeks of leave

16:43.847 --> 16:46.148
and I'll be right back at it.

16:46.149 --> 16:49.385
First of all, no, you won't.

16:49.386 --> 16:52.288
Those first few weeks with the baby...

16:52.289 --> 16:53.723
Are, like, super precious and magical,

16:53.724 --> 16:55.825
so everyone keeps insisting.

16:55.826 --> 16:57.627
Well, my experience was a little more

16:57.628 --> 17:00.529
like the opening sequence
to Saving Private Ryan.

17:00.530 --> 17:03.065
Way to sell it.

17:03.066 --> 17:05.300
But you'll get through it.

17:05.301 --> 17:10.740
And you will love that child so much,

17:10.741 --> 17:13.409
you won't know what to do with yourself.

17:13.410 --> 17:15.243
That's what I'm afraid of,

17:15.244 --> 17:16.913
losing myself.

17:16.914 --> 17:21.117
My career, everything I've
worked for, just subsumed.

17:21.117 --> 17:25.354
It's true. Things will change

17:25.355 --> 17:28.991
and some things will fall away.

17:28.992 --> 17:30.893
Drunken brunches, for example.

17:30.894 --> 17:35.398
But then other things
will take their place,

17:35.399 --> 17:38.134
other richer things.

17:38.135 --> 17:41.037
That's how life works.

17:41.038 --> 17:44.407
So take it while I can get
it is what you're saying.

17:44.408 --> 17:47.575
That's my two cents.

17:48.732 --> 17:49.904
Mr. President.

17:51.314 --> 17:54.884
Just getting some fresh air.

17:54.885 --> 17:58.421
Also contemplating going back to smoking.

17:58.422 --> 18:02.291
Wow. Budget negotiations
going that well, huh?

18:02.292 --> 18:04.581
I've had more fun fighting off a snake

18:04.582 --> 18:07.350
in a Vietnamese rice paddy.

18:07.351 --> 18:10.686
But it's the job I signed up for.

18:11.521 --> 18:14.057
So, Russell told me about your troubles

18:14.058 --> 18:15.725
with the refugee camp in Lebanon.

18:15.726 --> 18:19.329
Yeah. All we have to do
is turn on the lights.

18:19.330 --> 18:23.233
We do that, most of the
issues inside the camp go away.

18:23.234 --> 18:26.769
But if they fester, we could see

18:26.770 --> 18:28.037
Sunni radicalization...

18:28.038 --> 18:31.674
And in a country with such
a volatile mix of faiths...

18:31.675 --> 18:34.410
wouldn't take much for
the whole place to blow up.

18:34.411 --> 18:37.347
Sir, I remind you, every
single cabinet secretary

18:37.348 --> 18:39.916
has trooped through here
asking special dispensation

18:39.917 --> 18:42.118
for programs much closer to home.

18:42.119 --> 18:43.219
He's right.

18:43.220 --> 18:47.390
HHS, Veterans Affairs,
Education, Interior.

18:47.391 --> 18:50.994
If the shutdown comes,
there's lots of Americans

18:50.995 --> 18:52.128
are going to be hurting.

18:52.129 --> 18:54.497
No, I understand, sir,
but we're just talking

18:54.498 --> 18:57.233
about designating a few
contractors as essential.

18:57.234 --> 18:58.368
And how would it look

18:58.369 --> 19:00.903
when Morejon holds up a picture of a sad,

19:00.904 --> 19:04.641
furloughed park ranger next to
some Syrian refugee and asks,

19:04.642 --> 19:06.743
"Who does Dalton care about more?"

19:06.744 --> 19:09.145
All right, Russell, no need to pile on.

19:09.146 --> 19:10.880
Try sitting across from Morejon all day.

19:10.881 --> 19:12.077
See what it does for your mood.

19:12.078 --> 19:13.950
Look, Bess, I agree with you.

19:13.951 --> 19:15.618
I mean, you'd think that
a little bit of money

19:15.619 --> 19:17.850
or a little bit of extra time
for the team on the ground

19:17.851 --> 19:21.991
wouldn't be too much to ask, but...

19:21.992 --> 19:24.060
...today it is.

19:24.061 --> 19:25.795
No, I understand, sir.

19:25.796 --> 19:27.195
I'll find another way.

19:28.965 --> 19:30.500
Well, we'd better

19:30.501 --> 19:32.902
get back to it.

19:32.903 --> 19:34.803
Give 'em hell, Conrad.

19:37.674 --> 19:39.742
Look, Ms. Tolliver,

19:39.743 --> 19:41.611
I'd love to help, but
these vetting protocols

19:41.612 --> 19:42.679
are in place for a reason.

19:42.680 --> 19:44.681
I can't just make an exception for you.

19:44.682 --> 19:46.716
I'm not asking for special treatment.

19:46.717 --> 19:49.886
I'm asking you to rectify an obvious case

19:49.887 --> 19:51.020
of mistaken identity.

19:51.021 --> 19:52.322
But what if it isn't?

19:52.323 --> 19:54.490
You mean what if

19:54.491 --> 19:58.061
my son's 25-year-old girlfriend

19:58.062 --> 20:02.632
is actually the 60-year-old
wife of a retired,

20:02.633 --> 20:05.802
Burmese Army colonel with ties

20:05.803 --> 20:07.637
to opium traffickers?

20:07.638 --> 20:11.174
Uh, look, I'd have to review
the case more thoroughly.

20:11.175 --> 20:13.242
By which time our
government may be shut down

20:13.243 --> 20:14.911
for who knows how long, and meanwhile,

20:14.912 --> 20:16.646
Myanmar has one of the highest

20:16.647 --> 20:21.317
infant mortality rates in Southeast Asia.

20:21.318 --> 20:22.719
I don't make the rules.

20:22.720 --> 20:25.754
It's been a pleasure, Ms. Tolliver.

20:29.360 --> 20:30.660
Cute kids.

20:30.661 --> 20:33.429
Huh? Oh, uh, thanks.

20:33.430 --> 20:35.231
Madison and Hunter.

20:35.232 --> 20:36.733
Mm-hmm.

20:36.734 --> 20:38.801
You're gonna disappoint them.

20:38.802 --> 20:40.470
What?

20:40.471 --> 20:41.471
You don't believe me,

20:41.472 --> 20:42.872
but you will.

20:42.873 --> 20:47.043
And despite your best efforts,
they're going to resent you.

20:47.044 --> 20:50.146
And that, Mr. Bryant,

20:50.147 --> 20:53.116
will hurt more than you
can possibly imagine.

20:53.117 --> 20:55.218
So much so that

20:55.219 --> 20:57.553
in 20 years, when Madison

20:57.554 --> 20:59.789
or Hunter comes to you

20:59.790 --> 21:04.527
and asks you for a favor,
you will embarrass yourself

21:04.528 --> 21:09.298
doing anything you
possibly can to help them

21:09.299 --> 21:12.100
as I am now.

21:31.988 --> 21:34.690
This is the phone he called from?

21:34.691 --> 21:36.658
According to Langley, yeah.

21:38.394 --> 21:39.861
He could be anywhere.

21:42.498 --> 21:44.766
What do we do now?

21:45.501 --> 21:46.702
We find him.

21:46.703 --> 21:48.970
Come on.

22:05.696 --> 22:06.763
Help you?

22:06.764 --> 22:08.231
Yeah, we have kind of an odd request.

22:08.232 --> 22:10.299
We're looking for a missing
person. We think he might've

22:10.300 --> 22:12.268
showed up on one of
your security cameras.

22:12.269 --> 22:14.137
You think maybe we could
look at the footage?

22:14.138 --> 22:16.205
Yeah, that's not happening.

22:16.206 --> 22:18.174
Come on, man, this is really important.

22:18.175 --> 22:20.009
So go get a warrant.

22:20.010 --> 22:22.812
All right.

22:22.813 --> 22:24.746
How much is a room?

22:25.982 --> 22:29.384
Our presidential suite is 60 bucks.

22:30.620 --> 22:33.155
Here you go. Now can we look at the tape?

22:35.288 --> 22:36.917
_

22:37.660 --> 22:40.295
You two looking for a Russian kid?

22:43.866 --> 22:46.202
- Mitya?
- Alexander?

22:46.203 --> 22:48.438
- Mitya?
- Are you in there?

22:48.439 --> 22:50.071
- Mitya... _
- Hey, it's Henry.

22:51.140 --> 22:52.442
Hi.

22:52.443 --> 22:53.743
What do you mean, "Hi"?

22:53.744 --> 22:55.978
Get inside. _

22:55.979 --> 22:57.413
I'm clean. _

22:57.414 --> 22:59.749
Oh, yeah, right. That's why
you're holed up in this dump.

22:59.750 --> 23:01.984
I am clean, it's true.
Look, I knew I had to detox,

23:01.985 --> 23:04.954
and the only way to do
that was to be alone.

23:04.955 --> 23:08.224
So I came out here a few days ago and...

23:08.225 --> 23:09.559
I did it.

23:09.560 --> 23:11.527
Did what?

23:11.528 --> 23:13.629
I puked and cried

23:13.630 --> 23:16.532
and I shivered and
watched a lot of bad TV,

23:16.533 --> 23:18.134
but the point is, I'm better now.

23:18.135 --> 23:20.837
You think the CIA's just
gonna take your word for that?

23:20.838 --> 23:22.905
You think that's a thing
that's gonna happen?

23:22.906 --> 23:24.006
If you want to keep your job,

23:24.007 --> 23:25.041
you need to get your
stuff and come with us.

23:25.042 --> 23:27.477
Hey, look, I-I will take
any drug test you want.

23:27.478 --> 23:29.512
Look, I believe you're
clean right now, okay?

23:29.513 --> 23:31.147
And I know that this
started because you had

23:31.148 --> 23:33.149
some physical pain you
were trying to manage.

23:33.150 --> 23:35.017
But the point isn't just to detox.

23:35.018 --> 23:36.018
I'm a soldier.

23:36.019 --> 23:38.020
I'm not gonna sit around in a circle

23:38.021 --> 23:39.622
with a bunch of soft Americans

23:39.623 --> 23:41.591
and talk about how my
mother didn't hug me enough.

23:41.592 --> 23:44.160
- Although that's true. She didn't.
- Wha...?

23:44.161 --> 23:45.394
- Talia!
- What?

23:45.395 --> 23:47.063
She was a very withholding person.

23:47.064 --> 23:48.830
It could be a factor.

23:50.967 --> 23:52.502
Guys. Hey, guys.

23:52.503 --> 23:54.771
Hey, can you work this out later?

23:54.772 --> 23:56.839
I'm not an expert. Maybe
you have underlying issues

23:56.840 --> 23:58.674
that drove you to
addiction, maybe you don't.

23:58.675 --> 24:02.912
But right now Director Haymond
is getting you a bed in rehab.

24:02.913 --> 24:05.281
A place where your line
of work won't be an issue.

24:05.282 --> 24:06.349
I told you,

24:06.350 --> 24:09.084
I handled it my way, and I am clean now.

24:14.825 --> 24:17.426
Can't you see that I am ashamed?

24:17.427 --> 24:19.262
For what I have done

24:19.263 --> 24:21.164
to you, to my sister? Please.

24:21.165 --> 24:23.900
Please, it is better for
everyone if I can just...

24:23.901 --> 24:26.369
if I can deal with this alone.

24:26.370 --> 24:29.105
Alone and ashamed. That sounds
like a perfect emotional state

24:29.106 --> 24:30.439
to stay sober.

24:30.440 --> 24:32.775
Too bad for you, you're stuck with us.

24:32.776 --> 24:34.610
Come on.

24:34.611 --> 24:36.344
Let's go.

24:37.280 --> 24:38.481
How many cases?

24:38.482 --> 24:40.449
Just one so far.

24:40.450 --> 24:42.185
And it's definitely cholera?

24:42.186 --> 24:43.486
Yes, ma'am.

24:43.487 --> 24:46.322
The clinic at the camp only
has power three hours a day.

24:46.323 --> 24:47.623
I mean, they will never be able

24:47.624 --> 24:48.825
to get it under control with that.

24:48.826 --> 24:49.926
Good evening, ma'am.

24:49.927 --> 24:51.594
- Matt.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

24:51.595 --> 24:54.497
Uh, I drafted some remarks,
in case of a shutdown.

24:54.498 --> 24:57.099
Uh, an address to the
troops, if you will.

24:57.100 --> 24:58.701
You know, a speech like
this could prove to be...

24:58.702 --> 25:00.236
- "Essential"? Thanks.
- Yes.

25:00.237 --> 25:02.171
- I'm just right in the middle of something.
- That's your word.

25:02.172 --> 25:03.706
Okay, well, um... hey,
I'm always helping!

25:03.707 --> 25:05.875
You guys heard about the
cholera outbreak, right?

25:05.876 --> 25:07.410
- Hi, by the way.
- Yes, ma'am.

25:07.411 --> 25:08.878
We're running out of
time. Here's my pitch:

25:08.879 --> 25:10.079
what about solar?

25:10.080 --> 25:11.881
To power the refugee camp?

25:11.882 --> 25:12.882
No, my home.

25:12.883 --> 25:13.916
Of course the refugee camp.

25:13.917 --> 25:16.118
So-so I take it the meeting

25:16.119 --> 25:17.320
with POTUS didn't go as hoped.

25:17.321 --> 25:18.788
We're on our own.

25:18.789 --> 25:22.291
Here's my thought: if
we can't connect the camp

25:22.292 --> 25:24.427
to a reliable power
source, then how about

25:24.428 --> 25:26.696
we bring a power source to the camp?

25:26.697 --> 25:28.745
If I may, ma'am, that
idea was first broached

25:28.746 --> 25:30.099
when they built the camp,

25:30.100 --> 25:31.968
but deemed not feasible at the time.

25:31.969 --> 25:33.903
Solar technology has improved

25:33.904 --> 25:35.104
even since then.

25:35.105 --> 25:36.906
This assessment is worth reconsidering,

25:36.907 --> 25:38.274
given the circumstances.

25:38.275 --> 25:39.709
But quickly.

25:39.710 --> 25:42.678
- Yeah, if we had time.
- All we need is to find a contractor

25:42.679 --> 25:44.847
who's willing to ship enough solar panels

25:44.848 --> 25:46.983
to power a small city 6,000 miles away,

25:46.984 --> 25:49.685
before the government
shuts down tomorrow night,

25:49.686 --> 25:50.720
for free.

25:50.721 --> 25:51.821
All due respect, ma'am,

25:51.822 --> 25:54.190
but I don't know if we can pull that off.

25:54.191 --> 25:57.625
We are damn sure gonna
try, so let's get on it.

26:05.667 --> 26:07.688
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Roman.

26:07.689 --> 26:09.874
I just spoke with
Homeland Security, and...

26:09.875 --> 26:11.309
good news, Shindy.

26:11.310 --> 26:14.266
Your visa application has been approved,

26:14.267 --> 26:16.835
and you are free to travel to the U.S.

26:16.836 --> 26:18.170
whenever you're ready.

26:18.171 --> 26:19.504
Thank you so much, Nadine.

26:19.505 --> 26:22.074
Mom, I can't tell you
how much that means to us.

26:22.075 --> 26:23.341
It was my pleasure.

26:23.342 --> 26:25.343
We've got a great place
lined up in Berkeley.

26:25.344 --> 26:27.212
I hope you'll come out and see us.

26:27.213 --> 26:29.081
Are you kidding? My first grandchild?

26:29.082 --> 26:31.116
You'll have to drive
me away with a stick.

26:32.585 --> 26:34.252
Aw, I just wish you
lived on the West Coast.

26:34.253 --> 26:35.920
You could hang out with us all the time.

26:39.925 --> 26:43.095
What'd I say?

26:43.096 --> 26:44.429
Nothing.

26:44.430 --> 26:45.797
That's...

26:46.933 --> 26:49.167
Yes.

26:49.168 --> 26:52.637
That would be nice.

26:53.739 --> 26:54.973
Nadine?

26:54.974 --> 26:56.108
You're missing the party.

26:56.109 --> 26:57.708
Oh, I'll-I'll be right there.

26:59.244 --> 27:00.846
I have to go now.

27:00.847 --> 27:02.714
Um...

27:02.715 --> 27:03.815
I love you both.

27:03.816 --> 27:06.283
- Love you.
- Bye.

27:11.022 --> 27:13.125
Okay, this next one is from me.

27:13.126 --> 27:16.394
Meaning Blake ordered
it and I signed the card.

27:16.395 --> 27:17.829
It's an honor to serve, ma'am,

27:17.830 --> 27:20.431
even if you inexplicably hate games.

27:22.234 --> 27:25.470
Okay. Now, I-I know
what you're thinking.

27:25.471 --> 27:27.739
"A wet/dry vac? I don't get it?"

27:27.740 --> 27:28.878
But trust me,

27:28.879 --> 27:30.013
even though you're having a girl,

27:30.014 --> 27:32.144
from the minute they eat solid foods

27:32.145 --> 27:34.746
until they go to college, the
place is a complete pigsty,

27:34.747 --> 27:36.481
so... (whispers): you'll thank me later.

27:36.482 --> 27:38.383
Aw. I love it.

27:38.384 --> 27:39.618
Thank you, ma'am.

27:39.619 --> 27:41.219
- Okay.
- Sorry I'm late.

27:41.220 --> 27:42.521
Hey, Jay.

27:42.522 --> 27:43.889
Glad you could make it.

27:43.890 --> 27:46.291
Also... here.

27:46.292 --> 27:48.593
Uh, also, I need to borrow
the secretary for a minute.

27:48.594 --> 27:50.962
Uh...

27:50.963 --> 27:53.031
- A wipe warmer?
- Oh, believe me, it's the most important

27:53.032 --> 27:54.432
baby product you've never heard of.

27:54.433 --> 27:56.645
- Carry on without me, team.
- Thank you.

27:57.936 --> 28:00.871
Okay, here. Just a
little something from me.

28:02.107 --> 28:03.708
Oh!

28:03.709 --> 28:05.243
Come on.

28:05.244 --> 28:06.278
It's adorable.

28:06.279 --> 28:07.345
Ah!

28:08.781 --> 28:10.649
"Diplo Tot."

28:10.650 --> 28:13.718
- So, the good news and the bad news.
- Pardon me.

28:13.719 --> 28:15.287
- Yeah.
- I found a contractor

28:15.288 --> 28:17.556
who can install a small
solar field at the camp,

28:17.557 --> 28:19.324
probably within our time frame

28:19.325 --> 28:20.592
because they're already in the region.

28:20.593 --> 28:21.860
That's fantastic.

28:21.861 --> 28:23.962
They're a new company
whose whole business plan

28:23.963 --> 28:26.431
is using solar to power up refugee camps.

28:26.432 --> 28:28.300
They'd be willing to do the job for free,

28:28.301 --> 28:29.467
just for the publicity.

28:29.468 --> 28:30.802
What's the bad news?

28:30.803 --> 28:32.170
They're Israeli.

28:32.171 --> 28:34.206
And since Lebanon

28:34.207 --> 28:36.474
is still technically at war with
Israel, they're not gonna allow

28:36.475 --> 28:39.311
any Israeli goods, services
or citizens on their soil.

28:39.312 --> 28:41.613
Correct, ma'am.

28:41.614 --> 28:42.747
- That's...
- Bad.

28:42.748 --> 28:43.782
That's a bummer.

28:43.783 --> 28:45.549
Right?

28:48.320 --> 28:50.689
What if they weren't Israeli?

28:50.690 --> 28:52.657
- Ma'am?
- Does the company have

28:52.658 --> 28:53.758
reps here in the States?

28:53.759 --> 28:55.060
Yeah, actually. The guy I was talking to

28:55.061 --> 28:57.229
is here in D.C., hustling for contracts

28:57.230 --> 28:58.563
with Department of Energy and DoD.

28:58.564 --> 29:00.599
That's perfect. I want to talk to him.

29:00.600 --> 29:02.734
Tell Nadine to call Haymond at CIA,

29:02.735 --> 29:04.069
tell him I'm on my way over there,

29:04.070 --> 29:05.670
and then get your guy
to meet me at Langley.

29:05.671 --> 29:07.973
And also, the-the
Lebanese ambassador, okay?

29:07.974 --> 29:09.975
And tell my guys that
I'm on my way down, okay?

29:09.976 --> 29:11.610
Yes, ma'am.

29:11.611 --> 29:13.043
Langley?

29:14.379 --> 29:15.914
Well,

29:15.915 --> 29:19.184
here we are.

29:19.185 --> 29:21.987
It looks like a day spa.

29:21.988 --> 29:24.289
That's the idea.

29:25.958 --> 29:28.660
What are you going to
tell the rest of the team

29:28.661 --> 29:30.595
about where I am?

29:30.596 --> 29:31.863
Well, if we get shut down,

29:31.864 --> 29:34.666
I'll just tell 'em you were furloughed.

29:34.667 --> 29:38.635
If I say you're non-essential,
don't take it personally.

29:39.838 --> 29:41.840
Uh, it's, uh, it's
probably better for them

29:41.841 --> 29:44.309
to take a little break from me.

29:44.310 --> 29:46.577
They think I'm crazy.

29:47.612 --> 29:49.714
Maybe a little.

29:49.715 --> 29:52.951
But you impressed them before.

29:52.952 --> 29:56.320
And you'll impress them
again when you come back.

29:58.456 --> 30:01.693
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

30:01.694 --> 30:05.429
But we'll see how I do, right?

30:07.332 --> 30:10.402
Yeah, we'll have to see.

30:10.403 --> 30:11.703
So, let me understand this.

30:11.704 --> 30:14.739
You want us to hand over
proprietary technology,

30:14.740 --> 30:17.008
that we've spent years developing,

30:17.009 --> 30:18.143
to a CIA front company

30:18.144 --> 30:19.911
to install

30:19.912 --> 30:22.480
in a refugee camp in Lebanon,

30:22.481 --> 30:24.616
and we won't even get
any of the credit for it?

30:24.617 --> 30:26.518
That's about the size of it, yeah.

30:26.519 --> 30:28.253
In fact, this meeting
never even happened.

30:28.254 --> 30:29.554
And why would I do that?

30:29.555 --> 30:30.922
And why would we let them do that?

30:30.923 --> 30:34.225
Why would we accept charity
from a country that invades ours?

30:34.226 --> 30:37.295
That destroys our homes
and kills our citizens?

30:37.296 --> 30:39.030
To defend ourselves

30:39.031 --> 30:41.666
from rocket and guerrilla
attacks launched by terrorists

30:41.667 --> 30:43.068
- harbored in your country.
- Gentlemen.

30:43.069 --> 30:44.214
Gentlemen.

30:44.215 --> 30:45.737
We're not here to re-litigate

30:45.738 --> 30:47.171
the Israeli-Lebanese conflict.

30:48.840 --> 30:50.575
We're here to bring light and power

30:50.576 --> 30:52.977
to tens of thousands of
desperate, traumatized people.

30:52.978 --> 30:56.881
Yes, there are secondary
benefits, like...

30:56.882 --> 30:59.217
ensuring stability in your country

30:59.218 --> 31:01.820
and proving that your
product can work at scale,

31:01.821 --> 31:05.890
not to mention having the
U.S. government in your debt.

31:05.891 --> 31:07.859
If the shutdown happens,

31:07.860 --> 31:09.861
I will have to pull my team
out, and there will be no one

31:09.862 --> 31:12.530
on the ground to set up the solar field.

31:12.531 --> 31:16.768
I need you both to help
me help these people.

31:16.769 --> 31:18.636
By working with the Israelis

31:18.637 --> 31:21.071
and the CIA. What a world.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.576
Fine.

31:24.577 --> 31:25.910
Just please

31:25.911 --> 31:27.612
keep this to yourselves.

31:27.613 --> 31:29.214
I have plans this weekend,

31:29.215 --> 31:31.148
and it would be nice to live till then.

31:31.883 --> 31:33.650
So?

31:35.086 --> 31:36.421
We're in.

31:36.422 --> 31:38.757
But don't ask me to shake his hand.

31:38.758 --> 31:41.092
We're not Rabin and Arafat here.

31:41.093 --> 31:42.460
Great.

31:42.461 --> 31:43.962
So are we a go?

31:43.963 --> 31:46.664
It's never an easy ask
with you McCords, is it?

31:46.665 --> 31:48.365
No.

31:49.055 --> 31:51.728
Mr. President, the fiscal
year ends in a few hours.

31:51.729 --> 31:54.564
Either accept our amendments to the CR

31:54.565 --> 31:57.000
or we let the clock run out and
let the American people decide

31:57.001 --> 31:58.869
who to blame for the shutdown.

31:58.870 --> 32:01.171
You want to play that game? Fine.

32:01.172 --> 32:02.906
Our numbers may not be great,

32:02.907 --> 32:04.274
but Congress?

32:04.275 --> 32:05.742
You guys literally poll

32:05.743 --> 32:07.377
worse than staph infections.

32:07.378 --> 32:09.913
Carlos...

32:09.914 --> 32:14.418
I understand that you and
the party feel betrayed by me,

32:14.419 --> 32:18.088
but you're talking about
throwing hundreds of thousands

32:18.089 --> 32:19.456
of people out of work,

32:19.457 --> 32:22.426
delaying Medicare checks,

32:22.427 --> 32:24.394
projecting uncertainty to the world.

32:24.395 --> 32:25.896
Is that what you want?

32:25.897 --> 32:27.497
Mr. President,

32:27.498 --> 32:30.600
I know this might be difficult
for you to comprehend,

32:30.601 --> 32:33.403
but this isn't about you.

32:33.404 --> 32:35.504
It's about loyalty to principles.

32:37.975 --> 32:40.509
Well, I guess that's that.

32:45.215 --> 32:47.584
I did my best.

32:47.585 --> 32:49.286
Now you do your worst.

32:49.287 --> 32:51.188
Meantime, I'm going to continue

32:51.189 --> 32:52.990
serving the American people, so...

32:52.991 --> 32:55.325
if you'll excuse me,
I have somewhere to be.

32:55.326 --> 32:57.326
Y-You're leaving?

32:58.962 --> 33:01.631
But we still have three
hours before the deadline.

33:01.632 --> 33:04.066
And you have my final offer.

33:15.737 --> 33:18.840
Permission to ask an
impertinent question.

33:18.841 --> 33:21.643
Well, you did save my life
that time, so you get one.

33:21.644 --> 33:22.911
Shoot.

33:22.912 --> 33:24.212
Shouldn't POTUS still be in there,

33:24.213 --> 33:26.181
negotiating right up to the deadline?

33:26.182 --> 33:27.950
I mean, where is he going?

33:27.951 --> 33:30.352
You're right. That is pretty impertinent.

33:30.353 --> 33:32.354
Sorry.

33:32.355 --> 33:34.323
No, wait.

33:34.324 --> 33:36.325
You're still on the clock
for a few more hours.

33:36.326 --> 33:38.359
Come on and find out.

33:40.963 --> 33:43.732
So, if you're having
any issues with the VA,

33:43.733 --> 33:46.902
or retiring from active
duty, or if your family

33:46.903 --> 33:49.071
is getting jammed with your bills,

33:49.072 --> 33:51.006
you call that number

33:51.007 --> 33:53.542
and somebody will get it
straightened out for you.

33:53.543 --> 33:56.845
And if you're in a bad place

33:56.846 --> 33:58.447
and you just want to talk to a brother

33:58.448 --> 34:01.850
who understands, you call

34:01.851 --> 34:03.919
and you ask for me.

34:03.920 --> 34:07.255
I give you my word as a
Marine, I will answer that call.

34:07.256 --> 34:10.859
And those phone lines aren't
getting shut down ever.

34:10.860 --> 34:12.728
And that even goes for
you Army sons of bitches.

34:12.728 --> 34:13.829
Hooah.

34:13.830 --> 34:15.764
Hooah.

34:15.764 --> 34:17.866
Now I'll shut up so you all can talk.

34:17.867 --> 34:19.935
What's your name?

34:19.936 --> 34:21.103
Sean Johnson, Mr. President.

34:21.103 --> 34:22.371
United States Air Force.

34:22.371 --> 34:23.538
Thank you for your service.

34:23.539 --> 34:24.572
You're welcome, sir.

34:24.574 --> 34:26.408
- Thank you for your...
- So...

34:26.409 --> 34:28.976
- Pop quiz time.
- Hmm?

34:28.978 --> 34:31.079
What did you learn about
Morejon and those guys

34:31.080 --> 34:33.581
during all those meetings?

34:33.583 --> 34:37.585
That his chief of staff
has a staring problem.

34:37.587 --> 34:39.021
Good to know,

34:39.022 --> 34:40.755
I guess.

34:40.757 --> 34:42.456
What else?

34:42.458 --> 34:44.525
I think Morejon is scared.

34:44.527 --> 34:46.395
Yeah, he should be.

34:46.396 --> 34:50.063
He's the dog that caught the car.

34:53.735 --> 34:56.038
Well...

34:56.039 --> 34:59.241
let's hope you're right...

34:59.242 --> 35:01.810
'cause the Senate just
let the clock run out.

35:01.811 --> 35:04.679
Wow.

35:04.680 --> 35:07.282
Yeah.

35:07.283 --> 35:08.583
Buckle up.

35:08.584 --> 35:09.918
- Thank you, sir.
- Glad you made it back.

35:09.919 --> 35:12.191
You want to know why I brought you here?

35:13.822 --> 35:15.924
Because I asked an impertinent question?

35:18.223 --> 35:20.090
Look, the next few
weeks are gonna be ugly.

35:20.091 --> 35:24.829
People will say, "Ah,
that's Washington for you.

35:24.830 --> 35:26.597
A pox on both their houses."

35:26.598 --> 35:31.936
Meanwhile, Conrad Dalton
comes here every month,

35:31.937 --> 35:35.039
no matter what, and never
talks about it to anyone.

35:35.040 --> 35:38.242
And the reason he's
in that room right now

35:38.243 --> 35:42.112
and not me or Morejon
or some other windbag

35:42.113 --> 35:44.381
is 'cause he understands

35:44.382 --> 35:48.052
that some principles...

35:48.053 --> 35:52.122
really can't be compromised.

35:52.123 --> 35:55.159
Some duties really are sacred.

35:55.160 --> 35:58.461
I wanted you to see that.

36:02.933 --> 36:04.500
Thank you, Russell.

36:06.237 --> 36:08.939
Ah.

36:08.940 --> 36:10.573
Well?

36:18.482 --> 36:20.918
I'll edit the speech on Marine One.

36:20.919 --> 36:22.919
Let's go.

36:33.198 --> 36:35.332
We're really doing this, huh?

36:35.333 --> 36:37.434
Indeed we are.

36:37.435 --> 36:39.637
I've sent out the
department-wide e-mail

36:39.638 --> 36:42.473
to all non-essential personnel.

36:42.474 --> 36:44.909
And per your request, I asked everyone

36:44.910 --> 36:46.777
who worked in the building
who's been furloughed

36:46.778 --> 36:48.045
to gather in the main hall.

36:48.046 --> 36:49.246
Thanks, Nadine.

36:49.247 --> 36:51.982
Any changes to Matt's remarks?

36:51.983 --> 36:55.786
Uh, no. No, I think they
strike just the right tone.

36:55.787 --> 36:59.023
Believe this? Government shutdown.

36:59.024 --> 37:00.758
I mean, what kind of
message are we sending

37:00.759 --> 37:02.927
our friends and allies?

37:02.928 --> 37:04.862
I mean, not to mention our adversaries.

37:04.863 --> 37:07.565
- Ma'am...
- And now I've got to go out and send

37:07.566 --> 37:11.669
thousands of hard-working
men and women home

37:11.670 --> 37:13.804
on indefinite, unpaid leave.

37:13.805 --> 37:15.839
I mean, what are they supposed
to tell their families?

37:15.840 --> 37:17.041
And for what?

37:17.042 --> 37:21.445
I... I'm sorry, I'm ranting.

37:21.446 --> 37:23.380
Well, I know this is not the best time,

37:23.381 --> 37:25.382
but I really need to ask you something.

37:25.383 --> 37:27.051
Sure, yeah.

37:27.052 --> 37:29.119
- Just...
- Thank you.

37:31.189 --> 37:33.490
Well...

37:33.491 --> 37:34.758
...speaking of family,

37:34.759 --> 37:37.361
I'd like to request some

37:37.362 --> 37:39.563
personal leave to spend
some time with mine.

37:39.564 --> 37:41.498
- Of course.
- Thank you.

37:41.499 --> 37:43.200
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.

37:43.201 --> 37:47.471
Yes. Um...

37:47.472 --> 37:49.306
...I'm going to be a grandmother.

37:49.307 --> 37:51.342
Oh!

37:51.343 --> 37:53.978
That's really...

37:53.979 --> 37:55.913
that's wonderful.

37:55.914 --> 37:57.781
- Congratulations. Wow.
- Thank you.

37:57.782 --> 38:00.284
Thanks. Yeah.

38:00.285 --> 38:03.220
My son...

38:03.221 --> 38:08.025
said something to me today that...

38:08.026 --> 38:11.694
...I guess I've been waiting
a very long time to hear.

38:15.099 --> 38:16.900
Whatever you need, we'll make it work.

38:16.901 --> 38:19.536
Thank you.

38:19.537 --> 38:23.741
I mean, that is if you, if
you want to make it work.

38:23.742 --> 38:25.975
Ma'am?

38:27.711 --> 38:30.648
Something tells me you're not
coming back from that leave.

38:34.885 --> 38:39.123
I thought I needed time
to think about it, but...

38:39.124 --> 38:41.558
you're right. No.

38:41.559 --> 38:46.096
I won't be coming back from that leave.

38:46.097 --> 38:50.534
I love public service,
but it's gotten so vicious.

38:50.535 --> 38:54.738
Oh, and this pointless
government shutdown.

38:54.739 --> 38:57.141
Conspiracy mongering.

38:57.142 --> 39:00.778
Careful. You're talking
to a murderess, remember?

39:00.779 --> 39:03.147
Right. Right.

39:03.148 --> 39:04.615
I don't know.

39:04.616 --> 39:07.685
Somehow, we've become
our own worst enemy.

39:07.686 --> 39:12.889
And I don't want to spend the
rest of my career fighting.

39:18.762 --> 39:21.532
Well, I-I've become very dependent

39:21.533 --> 39:23.934
on you, Nadine.

39:23.935 --> 39:27.037
And as much as I'd
like to beg you to stay,

39:27.038 --> 39:30.641
sounds like you know what
you want in your heart.

39:30.642 --> 39:32.509
You're gonna be someone's grandma.

39:35.580 --> 39:39.516
Well, it's, it's very gracious
of you, Madam Secretary.

39:41.252 --> 39:43.187
Well, we made a damn good team.

39:43.188 --> 39:45.255
Yes, we did.

39:45.256 --> 39:50.928
And it has been my
great honor to serve you.

39:50.929 --> 39:53.063
The honor has been mine.

39:53.064 --> 39:54.898
Now brace yourself.

39:54.899 --> 39:56.567
I'm going to hug you.

39:56.568 --> 40:00.136
Oh.

40:03.874 --> 40:07.111
Thank you, Nadine, for everything.

40:07.112 --> 40:08.212
Thank you...

40:08.213 --> 40:10.748
Elizabeth.

40:13.051 --> 40:16.018
- Shall we?
- Mm.

40:28.132 --> 40:30.000
Good evening.

40:30.001 --> 40:31.668
I really appreciate

40:31.669 --> 40:34.705
you all indulging me
here for a few moments

40:34.706 --> 40:38.041
when I'm sure you'd rather be
at home with your loved ones,

40:38.042 --> 40:40.911
figuring out what comes next.

40:40.912 --> 40:43.614
Or at the very least, at
a bar with your colleagues,

40:43.615 --> 40:46.350
cursing the day you turned
down that job on Wall Street

40:46.351 --> 40:47.584
to work in government.

40:48.586 --> 40:49.720
Well, that commitment

40:49.721 --> 40:52.755
is what I want to talk
to you about tonight.

40:54.458 --> 40:57.861
Our work isn't political.

40:57.862 --> 41:01.265
Our work is representing
the interests and values

41:01.266 --> 41:03.600
of the United States to
the best of our ability.

41:03.601 --> 41:07.538
And let me be clear that in that effort,

41:07.539 --> 41:13.243
not one of you are non-essential.

41:13.244 --> 41:17.080
This department and
this nation and the world

41:17.081 --> 41:19.215
will be poorer for your absence.

41:20.818 --> 41:24.454
As for myself, each one of you pushes me

41:24.455 --> 41:27.023
to be better every single day.

41:28.692 --> 41:32.996
And I will be counting
the days until you return,

41:32.997 --> 41:35.232
especially the guy who wrote this speech.

41:36.734 --> 41:39.603
He-He put that line in
the speech, by the way.

41:42.073 --> 41:43.774
All of you,

41:43.775 --> 41:46.810
you chose to be here because
you believed in something

41:46.811 --> 41:48.412
larger than yourselves.

41:50.181 --> 41:53.150
That sense of duty and service is, well,

41:53.151 --> 41:57.354
particularly in today's
egotistical culture,

41:57.355 --> 42:00.356
in my mind, truly heroic.

42:03.093 --> 42:06.530
And so, on behalf of myself

42:06.531 --> 42:08.799
and the people of the United States,

42:08.800 --> 42:13.936
I say to each and every one
of you a heartfelt thank you.

42:19.710 --> 42:23.881
Until we see each other again...

42:23.882 --> 42:26.315
good night and good luck.
