00:40.673 --> 00:42.240
- So your parents have gone.
- Yeah.

00:42.242 --> 00:44.075
- Your girlfriend's gone.
- Mm-hm.

00:44.077 --> 00:46.077
You've been,
for want of a better word,

00:46.079 --> 00:48.012
abandoned this Christmas.

00:48.014 --> 00:49.414
Well, that's what I said
to them.

00:49.416 --> 00:52.617
We're not being unreasonable.
We're going on holiday.

00:52.619 --> 00:54.319
This house is gonna be
your house.

00:54.321 --> 00:56.721
You can do whatever you want,
invite friends over...

00:56.723 --> 00:58.289
Take a picture
of me and your mum.

00:58.291 --> 01:00.825
- Holiday!
- Whoo-hoo!

01:00.827 --> 01:03.094
- It's hard, right?
- Yeah.

01:03.096 --> 01:05.330
- It's tough.
- It's tough. It's...

01:05.331 --> 01:07.832
- How do you feel?
- How do you think I feel?

01:07.834 --> 01:09.801
- You tell me.
- I'm telling you.

01:09.803 --> 01:12.370
That's the point
of this session, right?

01:12.372 --> 01:15.874
My girlfriend of three years,
gone, left me,

01:15.876 --> 01:18.676
for a guy
who is completely my opposite.

01:18.678 --> 01:21.746
- This is my new boyfriend.
- I was gonna talk to you.

01:21.748 --> 01:25.984
You must have seen this coming.
This is not working out anymore.

01:25.986 --> 01:27.352
You're a mess, Noel.

01:27.354 --> 01:30.588
She's... she's gone.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.757
- Mm.
- And I don't understand.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.893
I don't understand
why she's gone.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.561
She was nice, I get it.

01:36.563 --> 01:40.131
She was a very attractive,
warm, funny...

01:40.133 --> 01:42.100
Thank you for the reminder.

01:42.102 --> 01:45.370
Well, you know,
let's not forget.

01:45.372 --> 01:46.671
I don't forget
and that's the problem.

01:46.673 --> 01:48.640
All I can do
is just sit in my bedroom

01:48.642 --> 01:52.877
and think about... her
and what we had.

01:52.879 --> 01:55.213
- You'll be fine,
- ok, enjoy yourself.

01:55.215 --> 01:57.448
- You'll be fine.
- Sweetheart, bye-bye.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.185
Alright, take care.

02:31.116 --> 02:32.217
<i> Bloody hell, Noel.</i>

02:32.219 --> 02:34.219
<i> I didn't want it
 to turn out like this.</i>

02:34.221 --> 02:37.388
<i> There's plenty more fish
 in the sea.</i>

02:37.390 --> 02:39.357
<i> The world's your oyster.</i>

02:39.359 --> 02:41.559
<i> You're not the guy
 that I fell for.</i>

02:41.561 --> 02:45.063
<i> We're not even
 into the same music.</i>

03:07.586 --> 03:08.920
Fucking hell.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.722
7, 7, 6.

03:10.724 --> 03:13.424
<i> Hello?</i>

03:13.426 --> 03:15.059
Hi. Hi. Oh, hello.

03:15.061 --> 03:19.097
I was just wondering
if Neil rodway still lived here.

03:19.099 --> 03:20.431
<i> - No, sorry.
- He doesn't?</i>

03:20.433 --> 03:23.501
<i> - No, he moved out.
- Ok.</i>

03:39.585 --> 03:41.753
<i>- Hello?
- Hi. You called?</i>

03:41.755 --> 03:45.089
<i>- Who's this?
 - It's Steve.</i>

03:45.357 --> 03:48.293
Oh. Uh, hey, man.

03:48.295 --> 03:51.195
<i>- It's Noel.
 - Yeah, yeah.</i>

03:51.197 --> 03:53.932
<i> - How you doing?
- Good.</i>

03:54.900 --> 03:56.167
Um, yeah, I was just...

03:56.169 --> 03:58.102
Seeing if you wanted
to go for a pint or something.

03:58.104 --> 04:00.438
<i> - Yeah, yeah, sounds good.
- Alright, mate.</i>

04:00.440 --> 04:04.442
<i> Get the old three amigos
 back together.</i>

04:04.444 --> 04:08.846
Yeah, definitely. Ok, bye.

04:14.954 --> 04:17.322
- How are you?
- What are you doing here?

04:17.324 --> 04:18.555
It's the session time, isn't it?

04:18.558 --> 04:19.791
I'm off to see my friend.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.291
That may be so. Five minutes.

04:21.293 --> 04:22.860
- Five minutes.
- For god's sake.

04:22.862 --> 04:25.463
Five minutes
is all I ask of you.

04:25.465 --> 04:26.664
- Shoes off.
- And then...

04:26.666 --> 04:29.100
- Shoes off.
- Coming off, coming off.

04:31.171 --> 04:32.503
- Wait. Simon.
- What?

04:32.505 --> 04:36.174
- Simon. Five minutes.
- Ok. Uh... let's begin.

04:36.176 --> 04:38.776
I need you to be as open
as you possibly can

04:38.778 --> 04:40.712
cos we're gonna try
something new today.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.880
- I've got a book here...
- Oh, Simon...

04:42.882 --> 04:47.051
And I've been looking and
there's pretty interesting stuff

04:47.053 --> 04:48.987
about opening up.

04:48.989 --> 04:51.289
So, ok, bend over.

04:52.091 --> 04:53.791
- Ok.
- This feels ridiculous.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.193
I know it feels ridiculous,

04:55.195 --> 04:56.527
but that's the whole reason.

04:56.529 --> 04:57.562
- Huh.
- Huh.

04:57.564 --> 04:59.731
Yeah? Huh.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.299
- Huh.
- Huh.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.735
- Huh!
- Huh!

05:03.737 --> 05:06.004
Huh!

05:08.040 --> 05:09.407
Huh!

05:09.409 --> 05:11.042
- That was good.
- Thank you.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.611
- That was very good, very good.

05:13.613 --> 05:16.614
- Phew. I feel good.
- Good.

05:34.066 --> 05:38.369
Whoa, whoa.

05:39.705 --> 05:41.539
- Don't do that.
- Oh.

05:41.541 --> 05:43.674
I thought that's what
we were doing.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.109
No, we're not doing that.

05:45.111 --> 05:46.244
Sorry, this is...

05:46.246 --> 05:48.579
I checked to see
if there was no one here.

05:48.581 --> 05:49.881
There was no one here.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.316
This isn't a joke. I'm not...
This isn't for fun.

05:52.318 --> 05:54.018
- I'm doing...
- I was actually just concerned.

05:54.020 --> 05:57.321
Cos you're stood on the edge
of a cliff screaming, so..

05:57.323 --> 06:00.124
- Ok.
- Wanna go again?

06:00.126 --> 06:01.392
No, I don't wanna go again.

06:01.394 --> 06:03.127
Look, this is
a private thing I do.

06:03.129 --> 06:04.195
It's part of my therapy.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.665
I kind of just need my space
to do this, thank you.

06:07.667 --> 06:12.103
You know, last year
my ex took me to Oslo,

06:12.105 --> 06:14.872
but the most amazing part of it
was we went to this gallery

06:14.874 --> 06:17.842
<i>and I saw edvard munch's
 the scream and I was just...</i>

06:17.844 --> 06:20.211
- Great. Sorry, I don't...
- I was just blown away by it.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.280
- Good. I don't... I need to...
- Have you seen it?

06:22.282 --> 06:26.884
- It's worth £119 million.
- £119 million? Brilliant.

06:26.886 --> 06:30.521
Can you please just leave?
Cos I need to do this.

06:30.523 --> 06:33.658
Good. It's not funny.
It's therapy.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.793
- It's a bit funny.
- It's not funny.

06:35.795 --> 06:40.465
Just so you know, I think
everything's gonna be ok.

06:45.971 --> 06:47.572
Not on that bench.
Sit down there.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.707
This is where I'm meeting
my friend.

06:49.709 --> 06:51.709
Well, there's benches
all down the place.

06:51.711 --> 06:53.277
You don't own this area
of the beach.

06:53.279 --> 06:55.179
There's a million benches
on this strip.

06:55.181 --> 06:57.815
Can you not just meet her
down there or there?

06:57.817 --> 07:00.785
- Or just not there?
- She's never been here before.

07:00.787 --> 07:02.753
She's from London.

07:02.755 --> 07:05.957
Just get on with your therapies
and I'll rate ya.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.226
- I'll rate ya.
- Jesus Christ.

07:08.228 --> 07:14.098
- Out of ten.
- Brrrrr.

07:17.402 --> 07:18.803
- I can feel you there.
- Oh, my god.

07:18.805 --> 07:20.538
That one was gonna be
a really good one.

07:20.540 --> 07:22.840
- That one was gonna be the one.
- Lovely meeting you.

07:22.842 --> 07:26.477
- You've been a real treat.
- Oh, no, don't go.

07:26.479 --> 07:28.146
Don't leave.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.982
I'm sorry.

07:33.519 --> 07:35.019
I thought you said
it's a ten-minute walk.

07:35.021 --> 07:37.455
I've just gone mad.
I've just gone absolutely mad.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.423
I've just walked
for fucking half an hour

07:39.425 --> 07:40.658
to get a shitty bottle of wine

07:40.660 --> 07:42.827
and you're talking to...
Who is he?

07:42.829 --> 07:43.928
I don't know, but I've just said

07:43.930 --> 07:45.730
the most amount
of weird stuff to him.

07:45.732 --> 07:47.064
- It's almost like...
- What?

07:47.066 --> 07:53.037
It's like I haven't spoken in...
In years and I meet someone...

07:53.039 --> 07:54.872
- Yeah.
- ...And I just ended up

07:54.874 --> 07:56.641
talking to him
about random stuff

07:56.643 --> 07:58.309
and then he just asked me
to leave.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.145
- That's really rude.
- He asked me to leave.

08:01.147 --> 08:06.484
It's fine. It's fine. He's
one guy... in wales. It's fine.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.953
Banzai!

08:19.064 --> 08:21.432
- Noel, mate!
- Alright, mate?

08:21.434 --> 08:22.733
- Over here.
- Hey.

08:22.735 --> 08:26.971
- Where have you been?
- Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

08:27.272 --> 08:28.272
You're effin' late,

08:28.274 --> 08:29.507
so I polished yours off.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.876
- Your round next.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

08:31.878 --> 08:35.613
I... I was up on the cliff.
I've got a thing I have to do...

08:35.615 --> 08:36.981
What were you doing
on the cliff?

08:36.982 --> 08:40.650
It's a form of therapy.
Primal screaming.

08:41.620 --> 08:45.823
It's complicated. It's just
a process I have to do.

08:45.825 --> 08:47.525
- It helps me...
- And you're screaming?

08:47.527 --> 08:51.229
- You're just going, "oh!"?
- No, no, no. It's a very...

08:51.231 --> 08:53.931
- How...
- It's a non-traditional, non...

08:53.933 --> 08:55.299
- Non-traditional.
- Yeah.

08:55.301 --> 08:57.235
It's a form of therapy
where you scream

08:57.237 --> 08:59.604
and it releases
some of your chemicals

08:59.606 --> 09:00.871
from the frontal cortex...

09:00.873 --> 09:03.074
Yeah, and that took you
45 minutes.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.675
That's the point,
it doesn't take that long,

09:04.677 --> 09:08.246
but I was interrupted
by a very obnoxious girl.

09:08.248 --> 09:11.649
Oh. Yeah?

09:11.651 --> 09:13.584
No.

09:14.920 --> 09:17.655
I know what you mean
by obnoxious, mate,

09:17.657 --> 09:18.889
and I'm holding 'em.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.958
Oh. Very good.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.861
Was she? Was she fit?

09:24.563 --> 09:28.065
She was...
Can I get you a beer?

09:28.067 --> 09:31.202
Wow. I can't believe
I'm actually traveling.

09:31.204 --> 09:33.838
Babe, you're in wales.
It's hardly traveling.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.539
- Wales is not in england.
- That's true.

09:35.541 --> 09:38.709
- You have to pay to get in.
- Therefore I'm trav...

09:38.711 --> 09:39.610
Really?

09:39.612 --> 09:41.612
Ah. Cheers, then, mate.

09:41.614 --> 09:42.813
Mm-hm.

09:42.815 --> 09:44.849
- Sorry.
- That was too much.

09:44.851 --> 09:46.050
I really get into a cheers.

09:46.052 --> 09:48.853
When I do a cheers,
i do a cheers.

09:48.855 --> 09:51.622
Here we go. One...

09:53.492 --> 09:55.860
That stings.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.137
Shut up.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.739
Where's the sand?
It's all rocks.

10:08.741 --> 10:11.175
Yeah.
- Did you proper grow up here?

10:11.177 --> 10:13.678
Proper grew up here.
- It's amazing.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.681
- It's fucking cold.
- It's fucking cold.

10:16.683 --> 10:17.648
It's fucking freezing.

10:17.650 --> 10:20.151
How many girlfriends
did you say you had again?

10:20.153 --> 10:22.953
- Too many. Too many.
- How many's too many?

10:22.955 --> 10:25.556
I've got so many notches
on my bedpost,

10:25.558 --> 10:28.592
my bed's become unstable.

10:29.061 --> 10:32.730
- That's a precarious bed, man.
- Yeah.

10:43.642 --> 10:45.142
Oh, my god.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.978
Oh, fucking hell.

10:50.682 --> 10:52.416
Steve?

10:53.151 --> 10:54.552
Steve, mate?

10:54.554 --> 10:55.653
Oh, f...

11:00.525 --> 11:03.627
- There's loads of that.
- Clear that up.

11:03.862 --> 11:07.565
I don't feel very well.
I don't feel very well.

11:09.801 --> 11:12.470
I feel...

11:12.472 --> 11:15.806
Oh, my... oh, my god.

11:16.308 --> 11:17.508
Steve?

11:17.510 --> 11:20.778
Steve! It's the girls...

11:20.780 --> 11:22.313
I was telling you about
last night.

11:22.315 --> 11:25.649
The girls are outside.
They're walking down the road.

11:25.651 --> 11:27.651
Oh, my go...
We've gotta talk to 'em.

11:27.653 --> 11:30.621
- Stop fucking pushing me.
- Hey, girls!

11:30.623 --> 11:33.057
- Shut the fuck up.
- Girls!

11:33.059 --> 11:34.558
Shh.
- Hey, girls!

11:34.560 --> 11:37.828
I'm gonna punch you in the dick.

11:37.830 --> 11:40.765
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:40.767 --> 11:41.632
Hello.

11:41.634 --> 11:44.034
Hey.
- Dick.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.803
- Primal scream guy.
- Hi.

11:45.805 --> 11:48.739
- Hello.
- Girl on the cliff girl.

11:48.741 --> 11:49.840
- This is weird.
- Yeah.

11:49.842 --> 11:52.743
- Do you live here?
- Yeah, that's my house.

11:52.745 --> 11:53.911
I'm literally round the corner.

11:53.913 --> 11:55.813
- No way.
- Yeah. It's really weird.

11:55.815 --> 11:58.182
Mandi.
Nice to officially meet you.

11:58.184 --> 12:01.185
- Oh. Noel.
- Saw you yesterday.

12:01.187 --> 12:04.021
- Noel. Noel.
- Cherie.

12:04.023 --> 12:05.089
- Hi.
- Noel.

12:05.091 --> 12:06.791
<i> Hi, Noel.</i>

12:06.793 --> 12:07.825
Hi. You alright?

12:07.827 --> 12:10.194
<i>- Where's Noel?
- Who are you?</i>

12:10.196 --> 12:11.929
He's nipped out for a second.

12:11.931 --> 12:14.331
<i>- It's Steve.
 - Hi, Steve.</i>

12:14.333 --> 12:16.967
<i> - Steve?
- I've got a mustache now.</i>

12:16.969 --> 12:18.269
<i> You've grown, haven't you?</i>

12:18.271 --> 12:19.904
<i> Oh, Steve!
- Hang on a second.</i>

12:19.906 --> 12:21.839
<i> We took him to football.
 - Yes.</i>

12:21.841 --> 12:23.941
<i>- Yeah.
- God, it's been years.</i>

12:23.943 --> 12:26.343
<i> - What's going on?
 - Yeah, what's happening?</i>

12:26.345 --> 12:28.012
<i>- Nothing. Nothing.
 - Where's Noel?</i>

12:28.014 --> 12:29.914
<i>- I'm just getting...
- What's that?</i>

12:29.916 --> 12:32.116
<i> What's that?
- No, no. How are you both?</i>

12:32.118 --> 12:33.584
I haven't seen you
in a long time.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.153
Yeah, that was weird yesterday,
wasn't it? But...

12:36.155 --> 12:37.721
- Yeah.
- Sorry about that.

12:37.723 --> 12:40.291
- It was all a bit...
- No, I... I'm sorry.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.159
I... that was strange.

12:42.161 --> 12:43.561
- It was strange.
- Yeah.

12:43.563 --> 12:44.862
It was just different,
wasn't it?

12:44.864 --> 12:46.564
And then I think
i just was like...

12:46.566 --> 12:49.033
Cos I was probably worried
about you, but...

12:49.035 --> 12:51.502
- It's fine.
- I don't really know you, so...

12:51.504 --> 12:53.737
- Ah.
- Got amazing eyes.

12:53.739 --> 12:55.573
- Oh.
- They're very, very pretty.

12:55.575 --> 12:56.974
You've got very pretty eyes.

12:56.976 --> 12:57.875
I can see through them.

12:57.877 --> 12:59.376
I'd probably shave the beard.

12:59.378 --> 13:00.544
We had a bit of a party.

13:00.546 --> 13:02.813
Got the old three amigos
back together.

13:02.815 --> 13:05.783
<i> - Ok.
 - So you and Noel and who?</i>

13:05.785 --> 13:09.119
Just the three amigos,
just me and Noel.

13:09.121 --> 13:10.020
<i> No third one?</i>

13:10.022 --> 13:11.655
You don't need three
when it's us two.

13:11.657 --> 13:14.058
That's what we always
used to say.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.093
So we're just gonna get
some breakfast.

13:16.095 --> 13:18.462
- Do you fancy breakfast?
- Oh, no, thank you.

13:18.464 --> 13:21.198
- We've got breakfast in here.
- You've got breakfast?

13:21.200 --> 13:23.934
What kind of breakfast
have you got in the house?

13:23.936 --> 13:25.169
Welsh breakfast, by any chance?

13:25.171 --> 13:28.873
- We're just having toast.
- Welsh toast, by any chance?

13:28.875 --> 13:31.141
I don't know.
I don't know what that is.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.978
- What's the difference?
- Do you have coffee?

13:33.980 --> 13:37.748
- Uh, I think we do.
- Shall we get some coffee?

13:37.750 --> 13:40.050
- I mean, is it ok?
- I think we should have coffee.

13:40.052 --> 13:41.719
- Ok.
- We don't... you don't have to.

13:41.721 --> 13:43.854
- No, it's fine.
- Oh, you do. You do have to.

13:43.856 --> 13:45.089
- Come on. Let's go.
- Ok.

13:45.091 --> 13:46.824
<i> Is the house alright?</i>

13:46.826 --> 13:49.159
Yeah, yeah. Look at that.
You've got the tree up.

13:49.161 --> 13:51.295
<i>- Can you see the tree?
 - Right, good.</i>

13:51.297 --> 13:52.062
He's been...

13:52.064 --> 13:54.431
Why wasn't he replying
to my texts?

13:54.433 --> 13:55.599
I sent him loads of texts.

13:55.601 --> 13:58.636
<i> He hasn't been himself
 recently, Steve.</i>

13:58.638 --> 14:00.871
<i>- Oh.
- He's... he's not...</i>

14:00.873 --> 14:02.640
<i> We've been so worried
 about him.</i>

14:02.642 --> 14:05.142
<i> He just needs
 to get out a bit.</i>

14:05.144 --> 14:06.911
Here he comes. There he is.

14:06.913 --> 14:09.179
- It's Noel!
- Hi.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.314
- This is Steve.
- Hello, girls.

14:10.316 --> 14:13.217
- Shut up.
- Come into the kitchen.

14:13.219 --> 14:14.418
- Come into the kitchen.
- Ok.

14:14.420 --> 14:15.853
- Ok, bye.
- My name is Steve.

14:15.855 --> 14:16.954
Nice to meet you.

14:16.956 --> 14:17.888
Nice to meet you, Steve.

14:17.890 --> 14:19.223
Who wants some bread?

14:19.225 --> 14:20.925
- Me.
- Toasted.

14:20.927 --> 14:22.993
Coffee. I need coffee
in me right now.

14:24.597 --> 14:27.264
- What was his name again?
- Hi.

14:27.266 --> 14:29.800
Hello!
- I'm just getting 'em drinks.

14:29.802 --> 14:31.602
- We're just having some coffee.
- Oh, good.

14:31.604 --> 14:34.638
- You hold the fort while I...
- Yeah, you stink.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.440
Got any clothes?

14:36.442 --> 14:39.209
- Um...
- This is nice.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.844
- What's his name again?
- Steve.

14:40.846 --> 14:43.847
- Steve. Steve, Steve, Steve.
- Oh, here he is.

14:43.849 --> 14:47.952
What? Have you just
turned your clothes inside out?

14:47.954 --> 14:50.854
- I couldn't find any clothes.
- Mate, oh...

14:50.856 --> 14:52.590
- Can you give me a hand a sec?
- Yeah.

14:52.592 --> 14:55.159
- Isn't that worse?
- It look... I think...

14:55.161 --> 14:57.528
Isn't the sick on your skin now?

14:57.530 --> 14:58.996
Steve.

14:58.998 --> 15:01.231
This is absolutely brilliant,
mate, absolutely brilliant.

15:01.233 --> 15:05.002
Shh. Just calm down.
Honestly, that really stinks.

15:05.004 --> 15:07.471
Mate, just calm down.
You're gonna freak 'em out.

15:07.473 --> 15:12.676
Mate, go and change. I've
got some... third drawer down.

15:12.678 --> 15:13.777
I'll be back in a little bit.

15:13.779 --> 15:15.112
I'm just gonna go and slip

15:15.114 --> 15:17.214
into something less reversed.

15:17.216 --> 15:18.716
- Ok.
- Something a bit more...

15:18.718 --> 15:20.951
- The right way round.
- Different clothes.

15:20.953 --> 15:22.886
- Ok.
- Come on.

15:22.888 --> 15:25.422
- So, Noel, you alright?
- Yeah.

15:25.424 --> 15:26.890
Have you ever traveled?

15:26.892 --> 15:29.226
Are you a traveler?
Do you like traveling?

15:29.228 --> 15:31.562
Not much, no.
- You don't like traveling?

15:31.564 --> 15:33.697
- I've been...
- I love traveling.

15:33.699 --> 15:37.101
I just love it. It's just
like... what's going on?

15:37.103 --> 15:38.736
He's just doing some yoga.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.604
- We do yoga.
- Oh, yeah?

15:40.606 --> 15:43.674
Yeah.
- My bloody bs are in a twist.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.376
What's going on?
What are you doing?

15:45.378 --> 15:47.111
- Hello.
- How you doing down there?

15:47.113 --> 15:49.179
Just chilling out.
- Hold on.

15:49.181 --> 15:50.314
He's got a bit of a bad injury.

15:50.316 --> 15:53.917
- I just have to help him up.
- I can so help you up.

15:53.919 --> 15:57.287
- That feels fantastic now!
- Oh, good, yes.

15:57.289 --> 16:00.090
Honestly, if you just take a
seat, we'll bring it right over.

16:00.092 --> 16:02.559
- Alright.
- Butter?

16:02.561 --> 16:06.030
- Have you put sugar in?
- So what's happening?

16:06.032 --> 16:08.799
- Which one do you want?
- I'm not doing that.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.235
- I don't mind, mate.
- I know you wouldn't mind.

16:11.237 --> 16:12.436
I know you wouldn't mind.

16:12.438 --> 16:16.407
Let's just say
this gentleman prefers blondes.

16:17.876 --> 16:19.276
Oh, the toast has popped. Toast?

16:19.278 --> 16:21.345
- Yeah, let's have some toast.
- You stay sat down.

16:21.347 --> 16:24.248
- You stay sat down.
- No, no, we'll come up here.

16:24.250 --> 16:25.716
We'll help. Cheers. Cheers.

16:25.718 --> 16:29.987
- Happy Christmas.
- Happy Christmas indeed.

16:30.422 --> 16:32.790
What brings you back
to porthcawl?

16:32.792 --> 16:35.859
- Are you a dancer?
- No, no, no, traveler.

16:35.861 --> 16:36.960
Oh, really? What, like a...?

16:36.962 --> 16:41.131
This is the furthest I've ever
been on my travels so far.

16:42.468 --> 16:45.035
- It looks good on me?
- It looks really good on you.

16:45.037 --> 16:46.670
Let me tell you something
about this guy.

16:46.672 --> 16:49.173
When we were bezzie mates
back in school,

16:49.175 --> 16:52.376
best wing backs
in the b team leagues.

16:52.378 --> 16:53.877
No.
- It's true.

16:53.879 --> 16:55.679
- Left wing?
- Left wing.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.314
- Left wing.
- What?

16:57.316 --> 16:58.182
- Yeah.
- No.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.817
I played football. I loved it.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.552
<i>I watched the karate kid and...</i>

17:01.554 --> 17:03.887
<i>- I love the karate kid.
- Do you love the karate kid?</i>

17:03.889 --> 17:06.356
- It's my favorite film.
- No! It's my favorite film.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.592
I've watched it,
like, over 100 times.

17:08.594 --> 17:11.829
I've seen the trailer to it.

17:13.397 --> 17:16.300
Uh, just see if I can get
a bit more coffee.

17:16.301 --> 17:18.769
Didn't you always wanna meet
your mr miyagi?

17:18.771 --> 17:21.371
- Yeah.
- I know.

17:35.620 --> 17:37.488
- Very good.
- That's so good.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.223
- That is so brilliant.
- So talented.

17:47.133 --> 17:48.932
- I love Ron Howard.
- I do.

17:48.934 --> 17:50.033
- Yeah.
- Me too.

17:50.035 --> 17:52.469
We could do that.

18:13.392 --> 18:14.825
- Oh!
- That's it, really.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.761
- It kind of stops there.
- Don't let kids listen to that.

18:17.763 --> 18:22.332
They wouldn't. I'm not basing it
on experience or anything.

18:22.334 --> 18:24.434
- They're so cool.
- Two, two, two.

18:24.436 --> 18:27.738
Ooh, ooh.
This is exciting.

18:30.075 --> 18:33.343
I know this song.
I know this song.

18:44.722 --> 18:47.324
It doesn't have to be
a film, by the way.

18:47.326 --> 18:50.227
Here we go. Ready?

18:50.361 --> 18:51.461
Film.

18:51.463 --> 18:54.097
<i>- Two words.
- Two's a crowd.</i>

18:54.099 --> 18:56.466
First word.

18:56.468 --> 18:57.835
<i> The grinch.
- Ill.</i>

18:57.837 --> 18:59.736
<i> Alien. Weird.
- Crazy.</i>

18:59.738 --> 19:01.071
Weird! Weird, weird.

19:01.073 --> 19:03.173
<i> Weird science! Yes!</i>

19:03.175 --> 19:05.175
We should be on a team.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.618
It's Christmas!

19:16.488 --> 19:18.889
- Do one from the '80s.
- '80s movie.

19:18.891 --> 19:21.225
- '80s movie?
- Movie from the '80s.

19:21.227 --> 19:23.160
Ok, shush. Right.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.862
- She's so bossy.
- Film. I know.

19:24.864 --> 19:27.397
- Film.
- And no talking.

19:27.399 --> 19:28.866
Fi... we've got the... film.

19:28.868 --> 19:32.002
It's so hard for her. It's
so hard for her not to talk.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.738
- Two words, babe.
- Two words.

19:34.740 --> 19:37.140
First word.

19:37.142 --> 19:39.276
- Pretty.
- Girl. Face.

19:39.278 --> 19:41.445
- Pretty?
- Oh!

19:41.447 --> 19:44.014
<i>- Pretty woman.
- Yes! Yes!</i>

19:44.016 --> 19:48.185
- That's it! That's it!
- 1990. Not from the '80s.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.920
Was it 1990?

19:49.922 --> 19:51.955
Welcome to Hollywood.
What's your dream?

20:02.768 --> 20:03.834
No, it isn't.

20:16.782 --> 20:20.517
- Oh! No one likes beans.
- And he hates beans as well.

20:29.661 --> 20:32.329
Oh, my god.

20:37.970 --> 20:38.969
I don't quite...

20:38.971 --> 20:41.939
I think we're going to go
and have some sex.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.908
Ok. I kind of assumed
that was...

20:44.910 --> 20:47.311
And I expect you to do the same.

20:47.313 --> 20:49.813
Ok.

20:50.915 --> 20:53.116
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

20:53.118 --> 20:56.453
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, my god. That was mad.

20:56.455 --> 20:59.456
That we were like rapping
and then we looked at them

20:59.458 --> 21:00.424
and they were like...

21:00.426 --> 21:01.959
- He's really...
- She's on it.

21:01.961 --> 21:04.227
She is confident with that.

21:06.365 --> 21:09.599
- Is she always like that?
- Yeah, that's why I love her.

21:09.601 --> 21:11.001
- Oh, my god.
- She's mad. You just...

21:11.003 --> 21:13.704
Everyone wants a bit of Mandi
in their lives.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.205
Well, he does.

21:15.207 --> 21:18.342
- In here?
- In here.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.848
- Oh, my god!
- What the f? Jesus!

21:24.850 --> 21:26.283
- Get out!
- Who are you?

21:26.285 --> 21:28.852
- Get out of here!
- What you doing? Who are you?

21:28.854 --> 21:30.420
- What are you doing here?!
- I'm sorry...

21:30.422 --> 21:32.990
- What are you doing here?!
- I am Simon!

21:32.992 --> 21:34.057
Who's Simon?

21:34.059 --> 21:36.860
There isn't anyone
called Simon in this house!

21:36.862 --> 21:38.095
- I'm Simon.
- Simon.

21:38.097 --> 21:40.931
- What you doing here, mate?
- I've got nowhere to sleep.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.666
It's Simon. It's fine.
I know him.

21:42.668 --> 21:44.634
I've been sleeping in the car
for two days.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.304
What do you mean,
you've been sleeping in the car?

21:47.306 --> 21:49.206
I just...
I didn't know where else to go.

21:49.208 --> 21:52.242
All I could think of was
coming here, Noel. I'm sorry.

21:52.244 --> 21:53.410
You're like a brother to me, ok?

21:53.412 --> 21:56.346
Don't touch him. Honestly,
you don't where he's been.

21:56.348 --> 21:57.347
No, it's good. It's nice.

21:57.349 --> 21:59.416
I've been sleeping in a car
for two nights.

21:59.418 --> 22:00.650
- A car?
- I had no option, Noel.

22:00.652 --> 22:03.186
It's the first thing
i could think. Thank you.

22:03.188 --> 22:05.956
- How did you get in?
- The key under the mat.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.724
- That's not your key.
- I know it's not.

22:07.726 --> 22:10.427
Honestly, my parents
will go mental if...

22:10.429 --> 22:11.862
I don't wanna abuse
our friendship,

22:11.864 --> 22:14.031
but I had to
sleep somewhere, ok?

22:14.033 --> 22:15.999
- I got kicked out two days ago.
- Why?

22:16.001 --> 22:17.968
I was just shoved
out of the house.

22:17.970 --> 22:20.303
My... my...
My... my snooker table,

22:20.305 --> 22:23.473
my... my... everything, my
flatscreen, it's all on the...

22:23.475 --> 22:25.008
You've been evicted
from your flat?

22:25.010 --> 22:27.010
I'm not very good
at paying the bills.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.645
But you're rich.
You're a therapist.

22:28.647 --> 22:31.882
It's not about the money. It's
the actual not paying the bills.

22:31.884 --> 22:33.250
Simon, why didn't you tell me?

22:33.252 --> 22:35.252
Because I didn't think
it was gonna happen

22:35.254 --> 22:36.787
and I just...
I didn't wanna burden you.

22:36.789 --> 22:38.622
You've got enough on your plate.
I know this.

22:38.624 --> 22:40.557
But I've thought about this
long and hard.

22:40.559 --> 22:42.192
I just think
this is a good period of time

22:42.194 --> 22:46.430
in which you and I, you know,
i can stay here for a few days

22:46.432 --> 22:47.464
and we can go through...

22:47.466 --> 22:50.967
We can make leaps and bounds
in your therapy.

22:50.969 --> 22:54.738
- I just need somewhere to stay.
- Where are your clothes?

22:54.740 --> 22:58.208
They're... they're in the car.
I broke in in my pants.

22:58.210 --> 23:02.879
Simon...
You can stay here

23:02.881 --> 23:06.950
for as long as you need
to get your shit together,

23:06.952 --> 23:08.151
or until my parents come back.

23:08.153 --> 23:12.089
But you are not staying
for any longer than that.

23:14.292 --> 23:15.592
- Ok.
- Good luck.

23:15.594 --> 23:16.927
Alright, mate. We'll...

23:16.929 --> 23:18.361
- We'll...
- Thanks a lot.

23:18.363 --> 23:19.830
It's fine, and, listen, mate,

23:19.832 --> 23:22.499
I just wanna say I'm really
sorry about your situation.

23:22.501 --> 23:23.800
No, you know, I just appreciate,

23:23.802 --> 23:26.169
you know,
what you're doing, so...

23:26.171 --> 23:27.771
Have a good time.

23:27.773 --> 23:32.209
- Have a good time.
- Ok.

23:36.615 --> 23:37.547
It was a present, so...

23:37.549 --> 23:39.449
You've got
an amazing collection.

23:39.451 --> 23:40.951
Yeah. I just like music.

23:40.953 --> 23:42.085
Oh, this is great.

23:42.087 --> 23:46.456
This, Elliott Smith, this guy
is the reason I got into music.

23:46.458 --> 23:48.425
- No way.
- Do you know him?

23:48.427 --> 23:50.660
You don't know Elliott Smith?
Oh, my god.

23:50.662 --> 23:55.832
He's, like, one of the seminal
artists of the late century.

23:55.834 --> 23:58.635
- What's that?
- Oh, it's just...

23:58.637 --> 24:00.704
- Oh.
- It was a gift from...

24:00.706 --> 24:02.572
- Sorry.
- That's ok.

24:02.574 --> 24:05.976
Yeah, she got it for me.

24:07.945 --> 24:09.846
What happened?

24:09.848 --> 24:12.983
- Um...
- When did you guys break up?

24:13.451 --> 24:16.386
- About a week ago.
- A week ago?

24:16.388 --> 24:17.621
- Yeah.
- That's new.

24:17.623 --> 24:20.790
It is, but I think it was
going on for longer than that.

24:20.792 --> 24:23.727
I think really
we broke up about a year ago.

24:23.729 --> 24:25.996
Really? The same as me.

24:25.998 --> 24:27.531
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:27.533 --> 24:29.199
Stayed in the relationship
for too long

24:29.201 --> 24:31.801
and then
the icing on the cake was

24:31.803 --> 24:34.004
he just became a complete idiot.

24:34.006 --> 24:36.139
He got this big, like,
acting job

24:36.141 --> 24:39.976
and... and just loved
all the attention.

24:39.978 --> 24:41.745
And it was just weird,
it was like...

24:41.747 --> 24:44.881
He was kind of normal
and then, yeah, got this job

24:44.883 --> 24:49.286
and just loved the attention
and loved everything about it

24:49.288 --> 24:52.022
and just kind of left me behind.

24:52.790 --> 24:54.591
It's mad
seeing someone change so much

24:54.593 --> 24:56.860
right in front of your eyes,
it's just...

24:56.862 --> 25:01.198
Every day I felt like I was
just behind this glass window

25:01.200 --> 25:04.768
going like, "hey! Mcfly!"

25:04.770 --> 25:06.102
"Anyone home!"

25:06.104 --> 25:10.006
Yeah. Oh! No one was home.

25:10.174 --> 25:12.909
Yeah, he wasn't at home.

25:14.011 --> 25:17.914
Well, how long
are you around for?

25:17.916 --> 25:19.716
Christmas.

25:19.718 --> 25:21.418
Look at your eyes.
You're so tired.

25:21.420 --> 25:23.420
I'm sorry.
I've been keeping you.

25:23.422 --> 25:26.957
No, I'm loving it.
I'm not... I'm not tired.

25:26.959 --> 25:30.493
- You're very tired.
- We can chat in bed.

25:32.130 --> 25:33.563
Sorry.

25:33.565 --> 25:34.531
Oh, yeah, socks off.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.433
- You don't want sweaty feet.
- No.

25:36.435 --> 25:39.469
Socks off. Always socks off.

25:55.586 --> 25:58.154
Are you still awake?

25:58.156 --> 26:00.523
No.

26:10.001 --> 26:14.404
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

26:14.739 --> 26:16.473
I misread it. I'm sorry.

26:16.475 --> 26:18.308
No, no.

26:19.411 --> 26:22.879
- I'm sorry.
- It's ok.

26:22.881 --> 26:24.481
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

26:24.483 --> 26:26.650
- I shouldn't have done that.
- No, no. It's ok.

26:26.652 --> 26:31.588
I just... I just don't wanna be
anyone's rebound.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.657
- Me neither.
- Ok.

26:33.659 --> 26:35.825
Ok.

26:37.562 --> 26:41.965
- Oh...
- I've got an idea.

26:45.336 --> 26:50.507
I could organize you
loads of dates...

26:50.509 --> 26:53.410
- Oh...
- And they can go really badly.

26:53.412 --> 26:54.811
Ok.

26:54.813 --> 26:57.814
And then you can
come back to me.

27:01.419 --> 27:04.220
And I wouldn't be a rebound.

27:07.825 --> 27:09.659
Deal.

27:11.395 --> 27:14.531
- Banzai.
- Banzai.

27:15.433 --> 27:17.400
Ok.

27:18.302 --> 27:21.237
<i> So, I'm just gonna throw
 a few things at you.</i>

27:21.239 --> 27:22.472
Metaphorically, of course.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.341
And we'll see
what we come up with.

27:24.343 --> 27:26.443
Have you been dreaming of late?

27:26.445 --> 27:27.644
- Yeah.
- You have?

27:27.646 --> 27:29.212
- Yeah.
- Talk me through one.

27:29.214 --> 27:30.914
- A typical dream.
- Um...

27:30.916 --> 27:35.318
I have this one recurring dream
where I'm underground

27:35.320 --> 27:40.657
and I'm a maggot and I'm sucking
on a dead cat's face.

27:40.659 --> 27:45.095
Ok, dead cat, sexual repression,
that makes sense.

27:45.097 --> 27:47.230
I don't dream that often,
which is unusual,

27:47.232 --> 27:52.135
because there's a lot going on
in my life at the moment.

27:52.137 --> 27:54.604
Um, I had
this awful, awful dream

27:54.606 --> 28:00.176
that I was a man,
sort of just an average man...

28:00.178 --> 28:02.412
That's not the awful bit,
obviously.

28:02.414 --> 28:03.480
So I'm on this ship

28:03.482 --> 28:06.282
and there are sort of
a menagerie of animals

28:06.284 --> 28:08.518
staring at me,
most of them cheetahs,

28:08.520 --> 28:11.554
and out of the mist
comes this figure

28:11.556 --> 28:13.757
and it's Terence Trent d'arby.

28:13.759 --> 28:16.259
And he sings at me
and he's got...

28:16.261 --> 28:18.428
I mean,
i used to be a fan of his,

28:18.430 --> 28:20.997
but he has got
a dreadful voice now,

28:20.999 --> 28:23.199
and something comes out,
it sounds like,

28:27.672 --> 28:30.840
well, this is what I'm trying
to work out. You tell me.

28:30.842 --> 28:33.276
I thought
you were the therapist.

28:33.278 --> 28:36.379
Yeah. Alright, let's move on.

28:36.381 --> 28:39.182
There's no point
in beating around the bush.

28:39.184 --> 28:44.788
Do you at any point
during your time alone...

28:45.823 --> 28:46.689
Masturbate?

28:46.691 --> 28:48.525
- What?
- Masturbate.

28:48.527 --> 28:50.293
- No.
- Masturbate. No? No?

28:50.295 --> 28:53.196
- Not at... never?
- I don't... I don't...

28:53.198 --> 28:54.664
Well, look,
if it's not something...

28:54.666 --> 28:56.332
If you don't look
at pornography...

28:56.334 --> 28:58.301
I don't look at pornography.
I find it disgusting.

28:58.303 --> 29:03.239
There's nothing disgusting about
two pelvises smashing together

29:03.241 --> 29:07.010
in a chorus of sexual ecstasy.

29:11.282 --> 29:11.981
Come.

29:11.983 --> 29:13.883
- All set?
- Think so.

29:13.885 --> 29:16.119
- Yeah, amazing.
- Thank you.

29:16.121 --> 29:18.521
- Smoking.
- Ok, then.

29:18.523 --> 29:19.589
- Done.
- Good.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.724
- Have fun.
- Thank you.

29:21.726 --> 29:24.227
- Thanks for sorting me out.
- Alright.

29:24.229 --> 29:26.396
- Bye.
- See you later.

29:26.398 --> 29:28.498
- Bye.
- Bye.

29:28.500 --> 29:31.401
<i> Did you like
 my choice of date?</i>

29:31.403 --> 29:32.335
Huh?

29:32.337 --> 29:34.904
What did you say
your name was?

29:34.906 --> 29:35.939
It's lovely out.

29:35.941 --> 29:39.042
Have I told you
that I'm a natural blonde?

29:39.044 --> 29:40.643
I said it's lovely out.

29:40.645 --> 29:42.445
- You what?
- Here...

29:42.447 --> 29:45.148
What did you say
your name was again?

29:45.150 --> 29:46.049
What?

29:46.051 --> 29:48.318
Have I told you
I'm a natural blonde?

29:48.320 --> 29:51.821
Yeah, you said that three times.

29:51.823 --> 29:53.022
What did you say your name was?

29:53.024 --> 29:54.924
- Noel.
- Oh. Mine's Michelle.

29:54.926 --> 29:55.925
I remember.

29:55.927 --> 29:57.026
Did you like my choice of date?

29:57.028 --> 29:58.628
- Yeah, it's lovely.
- It's good, isn't it?

29:58.630 --> 30:01.264
I really know what men like,
you know, activity and sweating

30:01.266 --> 30:04.567
and really enjoying outdoorsy,
cos I go on lots of dates.

30:04.569 --> 30:05.735
I'm not a slut or anything.

30:05.737 --> 30:07.270
I wasn't gonna say
you were a slut.

30:07.272 --> 30:09.272
I'm quite popular with the men,
quite alluring.

30:09.274 --> 30:11.441
When I'm in a nightclub,
it's absolutely awful

30:11.443 --> 30:13.243
because they just don't
leave me alone.

30:13.245 --> 30:14.410
I think it's because I can do

30:14.412 --> 30:16.179
this twerking thing
that Miley Cyrus does,

30:16.181 --> 30:19.115
when she goes like this
and she bends right down.

30:19.117 --> 30:20.016
I can see that.

30:20.018 --> 30:21.050
Have you ever noticed

30:21.052 --> 30:22.218
how flexible if you just...

30:22.220 --> 30:24.354
- I'd be watching mtv...
- Very like Miley Cyrus.

30:24.356 --> 30:27.323
- I can get my hands right down.
- You're very flexible. Ok, bye!

30:27.325 --> 30:33.630
Have you ever known anyone
quite as flexible as me before?

30:34.532 --> 30:38.701
Do it one wrap...
One wrap round.

30:38.703 --> 30:40.703
- I love it. I love it.
- It's gone in my eyes.

30:40.705 --> 30:42.472
- It's gone in my eyes.
- I love it.

30:45.142 --> 30:47.443
How do you feel
about this shirt?

30:47.445 --> 30:48.678
Brilliant.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.746
Wait till you see this woman.

30:49.748 --> 30:52.181
- She's incredible.
- Oh, good.

30:52.183 --> 30:55.184
She completely changed my life.

30:58.390 --> 30:59.289
Hi, there. Hi.

30:59.291 --> 31:02.959
<i>Welcome, everybody,
to living with a vagina.</i>

31:02.961 --> 31:06.429
Alright, have we got
any vaginas in the audience?

31:06.431 --> 31:10.867
Yep. I wanna hear v, v, v, v!

31:10.869 --> 31:14.904
- And your hands!
- V! V! V! V!

31:14.906 --> 31:17.140
You don't have one,
so you don't do it, ok?

31:17.142 --> 31:21.978
What do you have? You don't have
a v. What do you have instead?

31:22.279 --> 31:23.413
- Penis.
- Penis.

31:23.415 --> 31:26.716
Penis. You.
You, man with a p, up you come.

31:26.718 --> 31:30.453
There we go, ok? Are you
on a date with this gentleman?

31:30.455 --> 31:31.421
- Yes.
- Ok.

31:31.423 --> 31:34.123
So you haven't yet
had intercourse?

31:34.125 --> 31:35.458
No. Yet to.

31:35.460 --> 31:38.394
Do you feel like you want
to put his penis into you?

31:38.396 --> 31:39.729
I have had a slight urge.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.031
- There was a moment.
- It's kind of personal. What?

31:42.033 --> 31:43.600
- Pardon?
- Really?

31:43.602 --> 31:45.068
Am I not allowed
to speak about this?

31:45.070 --> 31:47.704
It's funny that this person

31:47.706 --> 31:49.038
is speaking over you.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.707
I wonder why that is.

31:50.709 --> 31:51.674
- Penis. Penis.
- Yeah.

31:51.676 --> 31:54.177
Because he has a penis. Exactly.

31:54.179 --> 31:57.547
Therefore he feels that it's ok,
it's acceptable,

31:57.549 --> 31:59.816
to talk over you
because you're a woman, ok?

31:59.818 --> 32:02.518
He thinks you're that small.
How about you feel small?

32:02.520 --> 32:04.988
- How about you go down there?
- Yeah.

32:04.990 --> 32:05.822
- Sit.
- Down.

32:05.824 --> 32:07.991
What? I'm not a dog.

32:09.660 --> 32:10.593
Ok. Ow.

32:10.595 --> 32:13.062
Who else would like to be part
of this program?

32:13.064 --> 32:15.231
You with the hat, up you come.

32:15.233 --> 32:17.900
Yeah, up you come.
- Oh, god.

32:17.902 --> 32:20.536
- Oh, my god.
- Come here.

32:20.538 --> 32:22.572
Ok? You are not special.

32:22.574 --> 32:24.273
- I want you to roll away.
- What?

32:24.275 --> 32:26.042
- Roll away.
- I'm not...

32:26.044 --> 32:26.843
Roll. Roll away.

32:26.845 --> 32:28.611
Seven quid for this?

32:28.613 --> 32:29.445
There we go. Ok.

32:29.447 --> 32:31.948
That's how it feels.
You on the end.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.316
- Lovely.
- Oh, my...

32:33.318 --> 32:34.317
Does that feel better?

32:34.319 --> 32:37.286
Well, looks like
you don't need me.

32:37.288 --> 32:40.156
You're obviously not taking this
very seriously, so...

32:40.158 --> 32:42.325
- Yeah, I'm gonna leave.
- Why are you leaving?

32:42.327 --> 32:43.726
- Because...
- Say it and walk away.

32:43.728 --> 32:45.561
Say it and walk away.
Three, two, one.

32:45.563 --> 32:47.597
Cos I fear you might have
a small penis.

32:47.599 --> 32:52.068
What? How did she make
that assessment?

32:52.070 --> 32:53.436
- What's that?
- Cologne.

32:53.438 --> 32:55.972
- Mm. Cologne.
- Perfume.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.507
- A bit of both?
- A bit of both.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.075
Ok. Right...

32:59.077 --> 33:01.144
On your marks, set...

33:01.146 --> 33:03.446
Oh, my god.

33:03.814 --> 33:05.415
- I don't like it.
- It's horrible.

33:05.417 --> 33:08.985
I don't like that.
It smells like bubblegum.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.854
So, uh, you like, um, weddings?

33:11.856 --> 33:14.991
Have you been to a wedding?
I don't know why I asked that.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.160
That's like a really
leading question for a date.

33:17.162 --> 33:19.696
- Have you done many of these?
- No.

33:19.698 --> 33:21.097
- First one?
- No, it's my first one.

33:21.099 --> 33:24.267
But I just thought, my friend,
it's actually a self-help book,

33:24.269 --> 33:26.703
but a friend said
that you should

33:26.705 --> 33:29.439
stop putting it off till later
and just do things now.

33:29.441 --> 33:30.873
Everything's an experience.

33:30.875 --> 33:32.475
Bad things and good things
have to exist.

33:32.477 --> 33:34.510
Do you understand?
It's about extremes.

33:34.512 --> 33:38.147
So even if some things go badly,
what you end with after that

33:38.149 --> 33:40.383
is something
that feels less bad

33:40.385 --> 33:42.251
because you've experienced
the badness.

33:42.253 --> 33:44.220
- Do you understand?
- You're coming from a...?

33:44.222 --> 33:47.090
Divorce. It's not finalized.
I'm technically married.

33:47.092 --> 33:48.624
I don't know
if that bothers you.

33:48.626 --> 33:52.228
No, it's fine. If you don't
wanna talk about it, it's fine.

33:52.230 --> 33:53.596
- No, I don't, no.
- Ok.

33:53.598 --> 33:56.666
He cheated on me, so I've got
a real thing about monogamy,

33:56.668 --> 33:57.700
if this does go further.

33:57.702 --> 34:00.603
I don't know if actually I want
another relationship in my life.

34:00.605 --> 34:03.139
- It's fine.
- You're a really good listener.

34:03.141 --> 34:04.907
This is really helping,
to talk to someone

34:04.909 --> 34:07.210
who actually understands
what I've been through.

34:07.212 --> 34:10.513
Don't laugh at me.
I'm a heart surgeon.

34:10.514 --> 34:12.482
- Yeah, I operate on people.
- Really?

34:12.484 --> 34:15.918
I know. People say, "you don't
seem like a heart surgeon."

34:15.920 --> 34:17.553
"You're so relaxed and fun."

34:17.554 --> 34:18.755
Obviously I'm not that at work.

34:18.757 --> 34:21.157
I have been under some pressure,
so things have been harder,

34:21.159 --> 34:24.260
but I have been... I mean,
I'm not like this at work.

34:24.262 --> 34:29.065
I don't... I do the operations
and nothing else really.

34:29.699 --> 34:30.900
We are having such a connection.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.835
I'm not supposed to talk about
how the date's going

34:32.837 --> 34:35.871
while I'm on the date, am I,
but I'm having such a nice time.

34:35.873 --> 34:39.342
Yeah, me too. It's really nice.

34:39.510 --> 34:41.944
- No. Yeah.
- Oh!

34:41.946 --> 34:47.683
Shall we... I just feel like
maybe we should go...

34:47.685 --> 34:48.885
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:48.887 --> 34:51.020
I think I need to say to you
straightaway that maybe,

34:51.022 --> 34:53.054
I mean, what do you mean,
a hotel?

34:53.056 --> 34:55.491
- The house.
- We just go to the house.

34:55.493 --> 34:56.659
And do whatever we want there.

34:56.661 --> 35:00.596
I've not done this before.
Do we set rules or no?

35:00.598 --> 35:04.734
Well, I mean, we'll just have
a cup of tea and see...

35:04.736 --> 35:06.736
- Mm, ok, I hear you.
- Yeah?

35:06.738 --> 35:09.806
- Mm, mm.
- I hear that.

35:10.374 --> 35:13.342
- Hm?
- Have a tea.

35:13.344 --> 35:15.211
- You're such a good listener.
- Thank you.

35:15.213 --> 35:16.946
I really feel like I can
just be myself with you.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.015
- Well, that's...
- Ok, shh. Act normal.

35:19.017 --> 35:20.883
Ok. Going back to the house.

35:20.885 --> 35:23.085
Going back to the house.

35:34.398 --> 35:35.598
- Hi.
- Alright?

35:35.600 --> 35:39.735
- What's going on?
- Dinner is served!

35:41.471 --> 35:43.339
Oh, wow.

35:43.341 --> 35:45.508
- You look amazing.
- You... yeah.

35:45.510 --> 35:48.678
- You look really christmassy.
- Very christmassy.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.379
I thought
you lived on your own.

35:50.381 --> 35:51.681
- Hey.
- Hello.

35:51.683 --> 35:53.449
- Oh, hi.
- How are you?

35:53.451 --> 35:56.085
Oh, I'm excellent, thank you.

35:56.087 --> 35:57.687
- Steve.
- Oh, hello, Steve.

35:57.689 --> 36:00.923
- I'm kind of scared.
- You don't need to be scared.

36:00.925 --> 36:03.726
Just... breathe out.

36:03.728 --> 36:05.027
It's gonna be amazing, ok?

36:05.029 --> 36:07.263
Do you want us to stay
and if you kind of think,

36:07.265 --> 36:08.865
"oh, god,
i don't wanna be here", then...

36:08.867 --> 36:10.833
- I think I'm gonna be ok.
- You are?

36:10.835 --> 36:12.168
- I think so.
- Ok. Ok.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.203
You don't think it's too much
for a first date?

36:14.205 --> 36:17.340
No, honestly.
You've got an amazing bum.

36:17.342 --> 36:19.709
Whispering about myself
as usual.

36:19.711 --> 36:23.646
Hello. This is the guy.
Are your ears burning?

36:23.648 --> 36:26.249
Cos I was just saying
about how great you are.

36:26.251 --> 36:29.652
- Shall we let you both...?
- Yeah, you should probably...

36:29.654 --> 36:30.953
- Shall we go?
- See you later.

36:30.955 --> 36:32.622
- Steve.
- Are we gonna get a pint later?

36:32.624 --> 36:33.789
We're not getting a pint.

36:33.791 --> 36:36.092
We might get a pint.
See what happens.

36:36.094 --> 36:37.994
I'll see you in a bit.
Alright, mate.

36:37.996 --> 36:39.262
- Bye.
- See you later.

36:39.264 --> 36:41.130
Your friends are really lovely.

36:41.132 --> 36:42.064
Oh, they're great.

36:42.066 --> 36:45.301
- So you've made a tea.
- I did. It's nearly all...

36:45.303 --> 36:49.805
Shall we... shall we do it?

36:49.807 --> 36:51.741
- Do what? Oh...
- Ok.

36:51.743 --> 36:55.711
I mean, ok, I think
the quicker we get down to it,

36:55.713 --> 36:56.846
the less embarrassing it is.

36:56.848 --> 36:58.080
Ok, number one, first rule,

36:58.082 --> 37:00.716
first rule of this,
don't look at me.

37:00.718 --> 37:02.151
- Ok.
- No, you can look at me now.

37:02.153 --> 37:04.153
Look at me in the eyes,
but don't look at my body.

37:04.155 --> 37:07.757
When I come on to you,
i want your hands up here,

37:07.759 --> 37:09.292
like around this area.

37:09.294 --> 37:11.360
Don't go round the back,
don't go at the front.

37:11.362 --> 37:13.529
- I'm very sensitive.
- Ok.

37:13.531 --> 37:15.331
Ooh.

37:15.333 --> 37:17.500
Ah. Hello.

37:17.668 --> 37:19.835
Noelly!
- Oh!

37:19.837 --> 37:23.172
- Hey.
- Hey. Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.

37:23.174 --> 37:25.574
Simon. Laura. Laura, Simon.

37:25.576 --> 37:27.276
How many times
is this going to happen?

37:27.278 --> 37:29.111
- Christmas has come early.
- Sorry.

37:29.113 --> 37:30.980
You should tell people
that you're on a date.

37:30.982 --> 37:33.349
Did I walk in
in the middle of you doing...?

37:33.351 --> 37:34.583
No, no, we were just...

37:34.585 --> 37:37.086
A couple of seconds later
and it would have been...

37:37.088 --> 37:39.422
- Inside?
- No. We were just chatting?

37:39.424 --> 37:40.856
How many people
do you live with?

37:43.227 --> 37:44.694
- This is...
- I am...

37:44.696 --> 37:46.062
- I am...
- My therapist.

37:46.064 --> 37:48.898
- You're in therapy?
- It's not really therapy.

37:48.900 --> 37:51.334
- We discuss everything, so...
- Where are you based?

37:51.336 --> 37:53.669
- Where did you study?
- I'm here, actually.

37:53.671 --> 37:55.204
- I'm living here at the moment.
- Ok.

37:55.206 --> 37:57.173
Just on a temporary
sort of basis.

37:57.175 --> 38:01.043
It's interesting. I only met
Noel tonight for the first time.

38:01.045 --> 38:03.212
- We've got a real connection.
- I'm sorry.

38:03.214 --> 38:06.115
I sort of feel like
I've really walked in on...

38:06.117 --> 38:09.185
You're not the first. It's been
like clapham junction station.

38:09.187 --> 38:13.389
Everyone coming and going.

38:13.790 --> 38:15.424
Oh, I see, right. Not...

38:15.426 --> 38:16.559
Yeah, ok. Um...

38:16.561 --> 38:18.494
What's wrong with him
with the therapy?

38:18.496 --> 38:22.465
Well, we're talking through
masturbation issues and stuff.

38:22.467 --> 38:26.502
He doesn't do it.
He just doesn't like doing it.

38:26.803 --> 38:30.172
<i>- You're upside down.
- That's better.</i>

38:30.174 --> 38:31.841
<i>- See me now?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

38:31.843 --> 38:33.209
<i>- Hi.
- Are you alright?</i>

38:33.211 --> 38:35.011
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

38:35.013 --> 38:35.978
<i> I've had a think,</i>

38:35.980 --> 38:38.080
<i> and I think what
 might be the problem with you,</i>

38:38.082 --> 38:44.186
<i> not that it's a problem,
 is that you might be... gay.</i>

38:44.188 --> 38:46.722
<i> - Are you a gay?
 - He's not a gay.</i>

38:46.724 --> 38:49.959
I'm not... I'm not...
I'm not gay.

38:49.961 --> 38:51.861
What are you talking about?
I'm not gay.

38:51.863 --> 38:53.629
There's nothing wrong with it,
but I'm not.

38:53.631 --> 38:57.233
<i> - He just wanks too much.
- I do not wank too...</i>

38:57.235 --> 38:59.935
I don't wank at all.
Why am I telling you this?

38:59.937 --> 39:01.771
<i> - Never?
- I don't, no, so shush.</i>

39:01.773 --> 39:03.506
<i> - You never wank?
- No.</i>

39:03.508 --> 39:05.274
<i> That's what being young
 is all about, wanking.</i>

39:05.276 --> 39:08.344
<i> You're in your 20s.
 You've got to wank.</i>

39:08.346 --> 39:10.846
<i> Your father,
 he wanks twice a day...</i>

39:10.848 --> 39:12.581
<i>- Don't wanna know.
 - Always has.</i>

39:12.583 --> 39:14.917
Don't wanna know. Don't need
to know that information.

39:14.919 --> 39:17.286
Don't wanna see that.

39:17.288 --> 39:21.924
- You're a good dancer.
- Just a bit of shiffy, shiffy.

39:21.926 --> 39:23.092
Progressing onto this now,

39:23.094 --> 39:25.027
which I haven't done
for quite a long time.

39:25.029 --> 39:27.463
I just usually would be
so embarrassed to do this.

39:27.465 --> 39:29.098
I'm gonna do a dip and a jump.

39:29.100 --> 39:31.033
- That's good.
- And a dip and a jump.

39:31.035 --> 39:33.369
Like this, like this,
like this.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.438
- Like that, like that.
- This is amazing.

39:35.440 --> 39:38.541
Like watching John barrowman
or someone really amazing.

39:38.543 --> 39:40.776
Really?
I need a heart specialist.

39:40.778 --> 39:42.078
I can check your blood pressure,

39:42.080 --> 39:45.514
but you seem to be
in very fine working condition.

39:45.516 --> 39:49.351
- Hip to hip.
- That feels like a dream.

39:49.353 --> 39:52.822
And you're the right shape
and height.

39:52.824 --> 39:58.094
- I just fit in here so nicely.
- It fits like a plug.

39:58.096 --> 40:00.729
It's just like
I've been here all of my life.

40:00.731 --> 40:02.698
Like a flesh plug.
- Mm.

40:02.700 --> 40:06.702
- Yeah, you're so right.
- Mm, yeah.

40:10.340 --> 40:14.410
Why's he got a funnel?

40:14.412 --> 40:15.478
Oh.

40:15.480 --> 40:18.948
It doesn't even work.

40:22.953 --> 40:24.620
<i> Oh, honey.</i>

40:51.314 --> 40:54.750
<i> I didn't want it
 to turn out like this.</i>

40:54.752 --> 40:58.320
<i> There's plenty more fish
 in the sea.</i>

41:00.123 --> 41:00.956
<i> Well...</i>

41:00.958 --> 41:03.225
Alright, mate?
- Fuck.

41:03.227 --> 41:04.927
Fuck.

41:04.929 --> 41:07.997
- Someone had a good night.
- I wasn't... that wasn't...

41:07.999 --> 41:08.964
No, course you weren't.

41:08.966 --> 41:11.867
- I never thought that you were.
- Jesus Christ.

41:11.869 --> 41:12.801
- So...
- So...

41:12.803 --> 41:16.138
I mean, that's great
that you did that last night.

41:16.140 --> 41:19.241
It's fine if you needed
to whack it out and slap it.

41:19.243 --> 41:21.977
I didn't whack it out
and slap anything.

41:21.979 --> 41:23.112
I didn't. Jesus.

41:23.114 --> 41:26.749
Would it make you feel better
if I said I did it as well?

41:26.751 --> 41:30.052
- No. Yes. Did you?
- No.

41:30.054 --> 41:31.887
For fuck's sake.

41:33.423 --> 41:36.859
- What?
- So what happened, then?

41:39.296 --> 41:41.797
Simon came back
and they ended up together.

41:41.799 --> 41:44.400
What?! He just cock-blocked you?

41:44.402 --> 41:45.634
He didn't cock-block me.

41:45.636 --> 41:46.902
I just handed the cock to him

41:46.904 --> 41:48.871
and he ran with it,
so it was fine.

41:48.873 --> 41:52.208
Like a Baton.
Like you're on a relay team.

41:52.210 --> 41:53.209
- Yes.
- Go!

41:53.211 --> 41:57.346
My cock into his hand,
he ran with it and it was fine.

41:57.948 --> 41:59.848
- Ok, so...
- Yes?

41:59.850 --> 42:03.285
I guess you're wondering
why I'm here so early.

42:03.287 --> 42:04.353
I was gonna ask.

42:04.355 --> 42:05.621
- Drinking tea.
- Drinking tea.

42:05.623 --> 42:09.758
Well, it's because you are
all done with your dates.

42:09.760 --> 42:10.626
Oh.

42:10.628 --> 42:14.263
So I've organized
something for you... for us.

42:14.731 --> 42:16.632
Ok.

42:16.634 --> 42:18.701
Wha... what?

42:18.703 --> 42:21.837
It's a surprise.
It's a day. It's just a day.

42:21.839 --> 42:24.240
- It's a day of fun.
- Ok.

42:25.609 --> 42:27.543
Ooh.

42:34.117 --> 42:37.019
Oh, look at this.

42:38.822 --> 42:41.090
This is amazing.

43:23.533 --> 43:25.301
Come on.

44:17.121 --> 44:20.823
Whoa. This is terrible.

44:24.094 --> 44:28.230
Let's have a little...
Oh, my god.

44:28.232 --> 44:32.000
- I like it, though.
- It's good.

44:32.002 --> 44:34.069
What was that about earlier?

44:34.071 --> 44:36.338
What was what about earlier?

44:36.340 --> 44:38.974
The text you got.

44:40.610 --> 44:43.345
From... what's-his-name.

44:43.347 --> 44:44.580
- From Gary.
- Yeah.

44:44.582 --> 44:47.850
It was nothing. He just said...
He was just asking how I was.

44:47.852 --> 44:53.021
I just thought you might be
a bit upset about it and...

44:53.023 --> 44:56.225
No, I'm having
a lovely old time.

45:01.931 --> 45:04.767
Dinner is served.

45:04.769 --> 45:06.368
- Wow.
- I've done Italian.

45:06.370 --> 45:08.470
I've done Italian pasta.

45:08.472 --> 45:10.339
It's very good for you.
Lines the stomach.

45:10.341 --> 45:13.308
- As my mum used to say to me.
- I'm very hungry.

45:13.310 --> 45:15.944
- So do pile it on.
- I will. One more?

45:15.946 --> 45:19.214
Yeah, just one more.
Just one more.

45:19.216 --> 45:22.084
I've got a confession.
I didn't make any dessert.

45:22.086 --> 45:24.887
So I thought we could just have
a smaller bit of pasta.

45:24.889 --> 45:26.388
- Great idea.
- As dessert?

45:26.390 --> 45:30.592
And then after that,
i was thinking that perhaps

45:30.594 --> 45:31.760
we could play a drinking game

45:31.762 --> 45:33.228
based on the twelve days
of Christmas.

45:33.230 --> 45:36.331
That's a really good idea.

45:40.403 --> 45:43.806
"Never have I had sex
in wales."

45:43.808 --> 45:46.375
- Oh, cheers.
- Oh, cheers to that.

45:46.377 --> 45:47.609
I haven't got anything to drink.

45:47.611 --> 45:49.111
Can I have
a little bit of your wine?

45:49.113 --> 45:50.846
- Drink if you have or haven't?
- You have.

45:50.848 --> 45:54.049
Oh, so if you have
had sex in wales, you drink.

45:54.051 --> 45:55.951
- Down the hatchet.
- Cheers.

45:55.953 --> 45:57.686
Down the hatchet.

45:57.688 --> 45:59.321
I've had a couple of sips.

45:59.323 --> 46:01.557
"Never have I ever been in love

46:01.559 --> 46:05.227
with somebody
around this table."

46:06.196 --> 46:09.331
- Ok. So nobody is.
- I can't...

46:09.333 --> 46:11.767
No, but it's...

46:11.769 --> 46:13.936
- God, I hope it's me.

46:13.938 --> 46:15.838
You'll never know.

46:15.840 --> 46:19.007
Secret Santa.
- Why are you drinking?

46:19.009 --> 46:20.609
I was just having a drink.

46:20.611 --> 46:27.149
So I have never been evicted

46:27.151 --> 46:29.184
from my flat.

46:32.555 --> 46:34.790
Lots of people here
have never even had a flat.

46:34.792 --> 46:38.494
Yeah, no, that's why
I've never actually, um...

46:38.496 --> 46:39.928
If you couldn't get evicted,

46:39.930 --> 46:44.166
it means you're doing
the right thing right from...

46:44.601 --> 46:49.137
I need the toilet.
Please excuse me.

46:49.372 --> 46:51.807
Do you think he's alright?

46:54.611 --> 46:57.379
Oh, look at this,
look at this, look at this!

46:57.381 --> 47:00.249
All of the uk,
we'll get that done first.

47:00.251 --> 47:01.717
- Ok.
- Before we go abroad.

47:01.719 --> 47:03.252
And then where do we go
from there?

47:03.254 --> 47:04.987
Cos I want to go to Ireland
as well.

47:04.989 --> 47:07.122
Do you wanna buy a phone?

47:07.124 --> 47:08.924
- Do you like it?
- Do you wanna buy a phone?

47:08.926 --> 47:12.027
Is that what they do in Ireland?
Well, we're all prepared.

47:12.029 --> 47:17.232
Scottish. Sit down now, poppet.

47:17.234 --> 47:19.301
- Oh, it's scary.
- I know.

47:19.303 --> 47:21.270
You're like a dominant wife.

47:21.538 --> 47:22.604
So it's a roll and a...

47:22.606 --> 47:23.805
A roll and a pop.

47:23.807 --> 47:25.474
Oh, no.

47:25.476 --> 47:27.309
- Mine's gone awol.
- A roll and a pop.

47:27.311 --> 47:30.846
- Roll and pop. Roll and pop.
- It's all in the roll and pop.

47:30.848 --> 47:33.615
- It's all in the roll and pop.
- Ah!

47:33.617 --> 47:34.816
- See?
- Ah!

47:34.818 --> 47:35.684
Hours.

47:39.323 --> 47:43.692
Right, competition,
who can peel it quicker. Go.

47:46.162 --> 47:48.397
Does it have to be in one piece?

47:48.399 --> 47:49.665
Ideally.

47:49.667 --> 47:52.568
Oh. My end fell off.

47:52.570 --> 47:54.603
Done.

48:02.613 --> 48:04.012
We should do
a Christmas movie night.

48:04.014 --> 48:05.847
Oh, my god. Marathon night.
I'd love that.

48:05.849 --> 48:08.216
- Just get loads of food and...
- Pick three.

48:08.218 --> 48:09.985
Now? Oh, my god. That's so hard.

48:09.987 --> 48:12.354
<i>Well, no, no. We've already
got karate kid, one.</i>

48:12.356 --> 48:15.057
<i>- Deffos home alone.
 - Home alone.</i>

48:15.059 --> 48:16.858
<i>- You pick the last one.
 - Weird science.</i>

48:16.860 --> 48:19.728
- Oh, good shout.
- Ker-ching!

48:19.730 --> 48:21.229
Bang.

48:25.401 --> 48:27.869
I'll put some music on.

48:27.871 --> 48:31.039
Come on,
I'll show you something.

48:31.041 --> 48:32.007
Come on.

48:32.009 --> 48:35.043
- What are you gonna show me?
- I'm gonna show you something.

48:35.045 --> 48:38.714
Swear never to tell anyone.
This is very sacred.

48:38.716 --> 48:39.881
- Ready?
- Yeah.

48:39.883 --> 48:41.416
Follow me.

48:41.418 --> 48:45.654
This is my room.

48:45.855 --> 48:47.923
Oh, my god.

50:04.568 --> 50:06.201
- You're amazing.
- I'm not.

50:06.203 --> 50:09.805
- Yes, you are.

50:09.807 --> 50:10.672
Just kind of...

50:10.674 --> 50:14.342
You're so much better
than you think you are.

50:16.345 --> 50:18.547
Promise me that
you'll do something with these.

50:18.549 --> 50:21.483
You have to put them out there.
This is you. I can see this.

50:21.485 --> 50:23.218
You light up. Yeah?

50:23.220 --> 50:28.023
You've done it now. That's it.
We're gonna do this.

50:32.129 --> 50:33.929
<i> Take some deep breaths. Go...</i>

50:33.931 --> 50:36.965
Through the nose...

50:36.967 --> 50:39.034
Out through the mouth.

50:43.040 --> 50:45.273
- Ho-da.
- Ha-zah!

50:45.275 --> 50:47.943
- Hoy.
- Hoy.

50:49.780 --> 50:55.784
Banzai!

51:01.992 --> 51:05.460
- No!
- I won it!

51:06.028 --> 51:07.562
Banzai.

51:07.564 --> 51:08.630
Banzai.

51:08.632 --> 51:13.068
Well done.
- Well done, Daniel-San.

52:05.154 --> 52:08.523
No.

52:13.162 --> 52:15.931
Hi. Hi. Alright?

52:15.933 --> 52:17.465
I'm sorry. Noel.

52:17.467 --> 52:19.501
- Gwen.
- Gwen. I know who you are.

52:19.503 --> 52:21.203
- You're amazing.
- Oh, thank you.

52:21.205 --> 52:23.705
I just wanted to...
I've got some beer.

52:23.707 --> 52:26.041
- Yeah, I'd love a beer.
- Sorry. I had a little bit.

52:26.043 --> 52:28.310
- That's alright. Cheers.
- Cheers.

52:28.312 --> 52:31.079
- How you doing? Alright?
- Yeah, good.

52:31.081 --> 52:32.881
- Good. You having a good night?
- Yeah.

52:32.883 --> 52:36.985
Wicked. Who are you...
Who are you here with?

52:36.987 --> 52:40.956
Um, I'm with my mate, Noel.

52:40.958 --> 52:42.157
I quite like electronica stuff.

52:42.159 --> 52:43.792
Some of the new
James Blake stuff's amazing.

52:43.794 --> 52:48.196
But I really like... I'm quite
into old Neil young records.

52:48.198 --> 52:49.164
Yeah, I love Neil young.

52:49.166 --> 52:51.166
Elliott Smith
and those sort of...

52:51.168 --> 52:55.270
- Boyfriend, then, is it?
- Um, no. He's not, no, no, no.

52:55.272 --> 52:58.807
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Oh, that's good. That's good.

52:58.809 --> 53:02.911
Sorry. Yeah,
how did it start for you?

53:02.913 --> 53:04.379
Cos I find the hardest bit is

53:04.381 --> 53:06.982
I can't ever
finish a song properly.

53:06.984 --> 53:09.417
And then once I do think
I've finished,

53:09.419 --> 53:12.554
I just can't stop...
Messing with it.

53:12.556 --> 53:15.857
Yeah. You've just gotta
learn, really, when to stop.

53:15.859 --> 53:17.792
Yeah. Sorry. I'm gonna...

53:17.794 --> 53:21.129
I'll be... one sec.
One second. Sorry.

53:21.864 --> 53:22.864
- Ok?
- Yeah.

53:22.866 --> 53:25.467
- Yeah.
- This... Noel, this is...

53:25.469 --> 53:27.035
- Sorry.
- Ryan. Ryan.

53:27.037 --> 53:29.471
- Nice to meet you. Alright?
- Yeah, cool, mate.

53:29.473 --> 53:34.542
Good. Listen, I'm gonna
go and have a... bit of a toot.

53:34.544 --> 53:36.077
Do you... are you a bit partial?

53:36.079 --> 53:38.346
- No, no.
- No, I'm not into it, mate.

53:38.348 --> 53:39.414
- Are you sure?
- Go.

53:39.416 --> 53:41.116
Come and put one
up in the air, yeah?

53:41.118 --> 53:44.085
I'll meet you outside in a sec.

53:44.087 --> 53:45.787
Go and have
a little one in the air.

53:45.789 --> 53:47.789
- I'm probably gonna kiss her.
- What?

53:47.791 --> 53:51.393
I'm just chatting about music
with Gwen and it's...

53:51.395 --> 53:52.694
- Honestly.
- Fine, fine.

53:52.696 --> 53:54.729
- Are you coming?
- Yeah, yeah.

53:54.731 --> 53:56.131
- Honest...
- Sorry to interrupt.

53:56.133 --> 53:58.099
- Are you serious?
- Serious about what?

53:58.101 --> 53:59.267
Me going outside with that guy?

53:59.269 --> 54:02.003
No. Go and have a big high one
or whatever he was saying.

54:02.005 --> 54:04.005
- Honestly.
- What has happened to you?

54:04.007 --> 54:06.241
Look, if you wanna
do that with him,

54:06.243 --> 54:09.678
I'll do that with Gwen,
so it's fine.

54:09.680 --> 54:12.614
- We're not a thing.
- No, we're not a thing.

54:12.616 --> 54:14.215
- No, we're not a thing.
- Great.

54:14.217 --> 54:15.417
You made that very clear.

54:15.419 --> 54:16.518
You made it clear.

54:16.520 --> 54:17.519
Yeah, you made it clear.

54:17.521 --> 54:20.088
Have a good one. Peace.

54:20.090 --> 54:22.023
Get a therapist.

54:22.025 --> 54:27.696
Anyway, the coolest thing is
when you think...

54:28.197 --> 54:29.831
Oh. Sorry.

54:29.833 --> 54:31.533
- Oh, alright, babes?
- Alright?

54:31.535 --> 54:34.903
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We were just
gonna go back to the Van and...

54:34.905 --> 54:37.872
Are you...
Did you want in on this?

54:37.874 --> 54:39.174
- No, I'm alright.
- Sure?

54:39.176 --> 54:43.545
- I like your hair.
- Have a good night.

54:59.829 --> 55:04.165
Any feedback from your highness
would be absolutely appreciated.

55:04.167 --> 55:07.569
- It'd be my pleasure, mate.
- Oh, my god. Thank you.

55:07.571 --> 55:10.338
- Can I get you another drink?
- Yes, I'd love one.

55:10.340 --> 55:11.940
I'll get you a fresh one
this time.

55:11.942 --> 55:15.210
Thank you.
Do you wanna take this one?

55:20.716 --> 55:23.551
Back to the Van, yeah?

55:25.221 --> 55:27.088
Cherie!

55:29.325 --> 55:30.759
Cherie!

55:31.427 --> 55:34.496
Cherie! Cherie!

55:38.534 --> 55:41.803
Cherie, please. Cherie.

55:43.139 --> 55:45.006
Cherie!

56:13.804 --> 56:16.504
- Happy Christmas!
- It's my satsumas!

56:16.506 --> 56:19.574
- Hey! Hey! Happy Christmas.
- Up you get. Up you get.

56:19.576 --> 56:22.343
How you feeling? You were
in a funny state, weren't you?

56:22.345 --> 56:25.947
- Hello. Happy Christmas.
- Happy Christmas.

56:25.949 --> 56:28.850
We have got an entire day
planned for you.

56:28.852 --> 56:31.686
Everything's happening.
The Robin has landed.

56:31.688 --> 56:33.288
And he's given us
a list of instructions.

56:33.290 --> 56:36.958
Yes, and he bought me
a pass to stay up all night

56:36.960 --> 56:38.126
and write the quiz.

56:38.128 --> 56:40.662
We'll be making the dinner
whilst you're swimming.

56:40.664 --> 56:43.298
Um, then the quiz.
Have I missed anything?

56:50.740 --> 56:54.042
- Happy Christmas.
- Morning.

56:54.044 --> 56:55.844
Happy Christmas.

56:55.846 --> 56:58.346
Why have you got
your trousers down? No.

56:58.348 --> 57:01.583
- Mate. Jesus.
- I've got to go.

57:01.585 --> 57:02.750
What are we doing today, then?

57:02.752 --> 57:05.653
- Are we texting the girls back?

57:05.655 --> 57:06.955
No.

57:06.957 --> 57:09.724
Come on, mate.
It's Christmas morning.

57:09.726 --> 57:11.593
I'm not...

57:11.595 --> 57:12.627
What? Come on.

57:12.629 --> 57:15.630
Can you just open the window
a little bit?

57:17.533 --> 57:19.334
We'll air it out.

57:19.336 --> 57:22.337
We've gotta get in touch
with them, mate, asap, mate.

57:22.339 --> 57:25.440
- Get down to the swim.
- I'm not going.

57:25.442 --> 57:27.909
- I'm not...
- Mate, mate, come on.

57:27.911 --> 57:29.911
- Mate...
- I'm not...

57:29.913 --> 57:32.380
Mate, look at me.

57:32.382 --> 57:34.816
Free mugs.
You'll get a free mug.

57:34.818 --> 57:36.518
If I go,
you can pull your pants up.

57:36.520 --> 57:42.257
- You get a free mug.
- It's too early for this.

57:46.328 --> 57:48.129
Have you spoken
to cherry...

57:48.131 --> 57:49.297
Cherie.
- What?

57:49.299 --> 57:52.400
- Cherie. Her name's cherie.
- I don't know if it is, mate.

57:52.402 --> 57:55.703
It's spelt cherry.

57:55.705 --> 57:58.339
It's cherie.

57:58.341 --> 58:01.209
We'll agree to disagree.

58:06.882 --> 58:09.751
Shouldn't we be in fancy dress?

58:12.189 --> 58:14.022
Shall we just go to the pub?

58:14.024 --> 58:19.928
Pub? Well, I didn't wanna
say anything, but I can't swim.

58:21.997 --> 58:26.301
Because there's one
and it's like... like a panda,

58:26.303 --> 58:28.203
but it looks like it's having...

58:28.205 --> 58:31.339
- You are here.
- Oi, what are you doing?

58:31.341 --> 58:33.007
Why weren't you
at the Christmas swim?

58:33.009 --> 58:36.077
- Can't swim, no costume.
- No cozzie?

58:36.079 --> 58:37.512
- No cozzie.
- Rookie's mistake.

58:37.514 --> 58:40.415
- I know. It was chilly...
- I wanted to go.

58:40.417 --> 58:42.550
Are we still doing
the Carol singing?

58:42.552 --> 58:45.086
- Yeah.
- We'll get one more half in.

58:45.088 --> 58:48.489
No. We've got to get back
and have dinner.

58:48.491 --> 58:52.160
Whoa. We've been spoken to.

58:52.162 --> 58:53.394
Yeah.

58:53.396 --> 58:54.662
Nice.

58:54.664 --> 58:59.767
- Lovely.
- Ok. Well, after you.

59:00.502 --> 59:02.637
It's nice, isn't it?

59:02.639 --> 59:05.406
Come on, chérie.

59:09.645 --> 59:10.878
<i> Scooch in a little bit.</i>

59:10.880 --> 59:15.116
You can go this way.
You can stay there.

59:15.118 --> 59:18.019
Actually, you two can switch.

59:19.955 --> 59:21.689
Ready?

59:25.128 --> 59:26.461
We don't even know
what we're singing.

59:26.463 --> 59:28.997
<i>- We wish you a merry Christmas.
- You need to tell us.</i>

59:28.999 --> 59:30.331
<i> We wish you a merry Christmas.</i>

59:30.333 --> 59:32.867
If you were listening,
i said it.

59:32.869 --> 59:33.768
Ready? Three...

59:35.305 --> 59:38.239
What was that?
- You count down. Three...

59:38.241 --> 59:40.441
But you don't count down.
Where's the two and one?

59:40.443 --> 59:42.410
You don't say the two
and the one because it's quiet

59:42.412 --> 59:45.747
because otherwise
the one and the two overlap.

59:45.749 --> 59:46.481
Alright.

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:02.997
I'm really sorry.
- It's not "king". It's "kin".

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:05.667
- It should be "king".
- K-i-n. It's kin, family.

01:00:05.669 --> 01:00:07.568
Good tidings we bring
to you and your kin.

01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:10.104
- I thought Jesus was the king.
- He was king of the Jews.

01:00:10.106 --> 01:00:13.074
And king of kings. But we're
talking about your family, kin.

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:24.385
Um...

01:00:31.293 --> 01:00:34.696
They've been through something
and we ought to leave them be.

01:00:34.698 --> 01:00:38.099
I completely understand they
need to speak to each other.

01:00:38.101 --> 01:00:40.368
But maybe if we just edge them
somewhere else,

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:42.704
I can get on with the dinner.

01:00:49.878 --> 01:00:51.379
I promise you,
just five minutes.

01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:53.614
If we interrupt,
it's gonna break the flow

01:00:53.616 --> 01:00:55.249
and I just think
he needs the time.

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:57.085
It's my job,
like yours was the quiz.

01:00:57.087 --> 01:00:58.886
- I know.
- I want to make the dinner.

01:00:58.888 --> 01:01:01.122
You will make the dinner.
A beautiful dinner.

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:04.158
Why can't they talk
somewhere else?

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:15.296
Check out that one.

01:02:45.294 --> 01:02:49.530
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

01:02:50.599 --> 01:02:52.633
- What are you doing here?
- What am I...

01:02:52.635 --> 01:02:55.069
The door was open
and I let myself in. Is that ok?

01:02:55.071 --> 01:02:57.371
Gary. Gary. Gary.

01:02:57.373 --> 01:03:00.908
It's Gary. It's Gary.

01:03:01.577 --> 01:03:02.777
No, it's not ok.

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:04.145
How did you know I was here?

01:03:04.147 --> 01:03:05.613
Well, it's Christmas.

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:08.015
Magic things happen.

01:03:08.017 --> 01:03:10.485
I called your mum.

01:03:10.786 --> 01:03:12.820
I've been worried sick
and I've been...

01:03:12.822 --> 01:03:14.222
What do you mean, worried sick?

01:03:14.224 --> 01:03:15.490
I just haven't heard from you.

01:03:15.492 --> 01:03:19.861
Yeah, cos I told you
that I needed some space.

01:03:20.362 --> 01:03:26.000
I got you Christmas flowers.
Um...

01:03:28.237 --> 01:03:29.804
Alright, I've been a dick,
haven't I?

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:31.939
Yes, you have been
a real massive dick.

01:03:31.941 --> 01:03:34.041
- Yeah.
- You checked out completely.

01:03:34.043 --> 01:03:35.977
I feel like I've been on my own
for the last year.

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:42.416
Yeah, yeah. I realize that.
I'll try and be... better.

01:03:42.418 --> 01:03:44.585
Let's just try
Christmas day together.

01:03:44.587 --> 01:03:47.154
I'm in a hotel.
It looks out over the sea.

01:03:47.156 --> 01:03:49.824
It's lovely. I'm booked there
till new year's.

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:53.227
We can go back to London
new year's Eve.

01:03:53.229 --> 01:03:55.329
I'm so sorry.
- Hi.

01:03:55.331 --> 01:03:57.298
Hi. I'm Simon.
I'm Noel's therapist.

01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:00.167
- Simon, hi.
- It's lovely to meet you.

01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:02.937
- We were... uh...
- Sorry, I'm Gary.

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:06.874
- Gary. Gary Greene.
- You really look very familiar.

01:04:06.876 --> 01:04:07.975
Gary Greene...

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:10.578
<i>Do you ever watch a show
called the boroughs?</i>

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:13.014
<i> The boroughs...
 The boroughs....</i>

01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:15.483
- Steve.
- St... Yes, of course.

01:04:15.485 --> 01:04:18.419
- Oi, you two, shut it.
- Yes, yes. Yes!

01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:19.987
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, Steve.
- Steve.

01:04:19.989 --> 01:04:21.322
Steve, of course.
That's amazing.

01:04:21.324 --> 01:04:22.890
People don't often
realize it's...

01:04:22.892 --> 01:04:25.526
I put it on.
I'm not really a cockney.

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:28.663
I would be remiss if I didn't
ask you to stay for dinner.

01:04:28.665 --> 01:04:31.265
We've made so much food
and it's Christmas day.

01:04:31.267 --> 01:04:33.267
Simon.
- I've got no plans. I just...

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:37.204
I just wanted to see cherie.
I mean, I can... I can stay.

01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:39.574
There's loads of room.
Potatoes galore.

01:04:39.576 --> 01:04:41.876
- Oh, fantastic.
- And some Turkey.

01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:44.612
- Great. Let's go.
- No, absolutely, yeah.

01:04:44.614 --> 01:04:47.815
- Come on, come on, let's go.
- Join in.

01:04:47.817 --> 01:04:49.984
- Hello, gang.
- Hey.

01:04:49.986 --> 01:04:52.486
- Hey, hey. I'm Gary. I'm Gary.
- This is Gary.

01:04:52.488 --> 01:04:54.221
<i>He's in the boroughs.
He plays...</i>

01:04:54.223 --> 01:04:56.524
Oh! I got it, I got it.

01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:03.030
That is something to behold.

01:05:03.032 --> 01:05:05.833
Perfectly cooked.
Well done, Laura.

01:05:05.835 --> 01:05:07.935
It's a big 'un this year.

01:05:07.937 --> 01:05:09.971
Absolutely amazing.

01:05:09.973 --> 01:05:12.506
- Cheers.
- Let me clink glasses with you.

01:05:12.508 --> 01:05:14.542
- Cheers, Gary. Cheers.
- Oh, cheers.

01:05:14.544 --> 01:05:16.611
You're nothing
like your character at all.

01:05:16.613 --> 01:05:19.714
Well, you know, you know,
that's acting, that's acting.

01:05:19.716 --> 01:05:21.682
You're really good
at that, though.

01:05:21.684 --> 01:05:24.118
Will you do the voice?
Please do the voice.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.486
Merry Christmas.

01:05:25.488 --> 01:05:28.522
Yeah? Yeah, merry Christmas.

01:05:28.524 --> 01:05:31.258
- Who wants some sprouts?

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:34.829
See, I can just kind of
turn it on, you know.

01:05:34.831 --> 01:05:37.765
Turkey time.
- Yes. Come on, come on.

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.400
- Right, then.
- Is that a Turkey?

01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:43.204
Let me... it's a very, very
little baby Turkey.

01:05:43.206 --> 01:05:45.673
What am I doing?
You should be doing this.

01:05:45.675 --> 01:05:47.475
- No, no.
- Gary, come on, please.

01:05:47.477 --> 01:05:49.510
- It's your honor.
- It's fine, I'll do it.

01:05:49.512 --> 01:05:53.247
- Well, no, I mean, I can do it.
- I'll do it. It's fine.

01:05:53.249 --> 01:05:56.917
- Oh, no.
- No, no. Really? Really?

01:05:56.919 --> 01:06:00.221
- No, you're...
- Split it in seven.

01:06:00.223 --> 01:06:02.556
- Even bits.
- Oh...

01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:04.825
- There you go, mate.
- Noel.

01:06:04.827 --> 01:06:06.661
What? What bit do you want? Leg?

01:06:06.663 --> 01:06:09.330
- I do like legs, yes.
- What do you want?

01:06:09.332 --> 01:06:14.368
No. It's still got the string on
that you bind it together.

01:06:14.370 --> 01:06:17.938
You've done a good job there.
There's no waste now.

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:21.475
No, I'm alright.
I don't need any more than that.

01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:22.276
Right, ok...

01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:24.211
That's worked out
surprising well.

01:06:24.213 --> 01:06:26.914
- Thank you, Noel. Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:06:26.916 --> 01:06:28.582
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:06:28.584 --> 01:06:32.520
Aren't you hungry?
- We only met three days ago.

01:06:32.522 --> 01:06:34.355
No. I thought
you'd been together for ages.

01:06:34.357 --> 01:06:36.290
What about you two?
How did you two meet?

01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:38.459
How did we meet?
It was drama school, wasn't it?

01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:41.762
- Yeah, we trained together.
- Yeah. We trained together.

01:06:41.764 --> 01:06:45.800
For three years and
then we both got a job together.

01:06:45.802 --> 01:06:48.969
It was just a fringe play.
You know what fringe theatre is?

01:06:48.971 --> 01:06:52.239
You don't get paid.
It was above a pub.

01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:56.911
And it was real... and we just
had a laugh every night.

01:06:59.014 --> 01:07:01.482
Right, pens for you.

01:07:01.484 --> 01:07:05.086
- Pens for you and pens for you.
- Thank you.

01:07:05.088 --> 01:07:08.122
Right, then,
Simon's Christmas bonanza!

01:07:08.124 --> 01:07:09.790
- You can do the writing.
- Alright, ok.

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:12.860
Thank you for doing this.
We are incredibly grateful.

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.695
I was up till
three in the morning doing this.

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:18.232
So I hope you enjoy. Alright,
then, here's question one.

01:07:18.234 --> 01:07:19.266
Happy Christmas.

01:07:19.268 --> 01:07:21.902
In what country,
the world's seventh largest

01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:27.975
<i>by geographical area,
is Christmas known as bada din?</i>

01:07:27.977 --> 01:07:29.343
- Yep, ok.
- Easy, mate.

01:07:29.345 --> 01:07:31.412
Do we write these down
or say them out loud?

01:07:31.414 --> 01:07:34.815
- It's not Norway.
- Move on.

01:07:34.817 --> 01:07:36.484
Yeah, put that.
It's gotta be that.

01:07:36.486 --> 01:07:39.153
- It's not Norway.
- Question number two.

01:07:39.155 --> 01:07:42.690
Which famous Christmas movie
is this a quote from?

01:07:42.692 --> 01:07:45.426
"Bless this
highly nutritious microwaveable

01:07:45.428 --> 01:07:49.296
macaroni and cheese dinner and
the people who sold it on sale."

01:07:49.298 --> 01:07:50.731
- Easy.
- "Amen."

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:53.834
- Easy.
- You know what that is?

01:07:53.836 --> 01:07:57.638
We're effing this, mate.
We are effing it.

01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:08.983
- What's going on?
- What's going on? Oh...

01:08:08.985 --> 01:08:11.619
It's not my fault
that he's here.

01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:12.686
Seriously? Honestly?

01:08:12.688 --> 01:08:17.390
Cherie, I saw you get
into the Van with another guy.

01:08:17.393 --> 01:08:19.859
- I saw...
- What Van?

01:08:19.862 --> 01:08:23.029
Please, cherie!
Please can I just talk to you?

01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:24.799
Cherie...

01:08:24.801 --> 01:08:26.600
I never went off
with the guy in the Van.

01:08:26.602 --> 01:08:29.703
- I saw you get in the Van.
- No, I didn't.

01:08:29.705 --> 01:08:31.372
- You're lying to me.
- Elaborate on the Van.

01:08:31.374 --> 01:08:34.140
Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm talking
about you, not to you!

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:37.211
- Can you just give us a...
- Take a break.

01:08:37.212 --> 01:08:40.381
- Are you alright?

01:08:41.015 --> 01:08:42.950
He's a bit tense.

01:09:00.001 --> 01:09:03.170
Oh, I've eaten
a lot of after eights.

01:09:03.171 --> 01:09:05.840
- Oh.
- Got an after eight baby.

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:07.942
Yeah. Oh, god, yeah.

01:09:12.046 --> 01:09:14.415
Nice to see ya.

01:09:14.683 --> 01:09:16.483
Thanks for letting me
have Christmas day

01:09:16.484 --> 01:09:18.919
with you and your...
Mental friends.

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:22.022
- They're nice. They're nice.
- Yeah, they're lovely.

01:09:22.024 --> 01:09:24.625
- Mad lovely.
- They are nice.

01:09:24.893 --> 01:09:30.798
So...
I have got a room in a hotel.

01:09:31.533 --> 01:09:36.370
It's nice. It's not too big,
but it's... it's ok.

01:09:36.638 --> 01:09:39.439
You're used to big,
swanky hotel rooms now.

01:09:39.442 --> 01:09:44.578
Yeah, well, you know...
It's not as sweet.

01:09:45.947 --> 01:09:47.448
Come on.

01:09:48.416 --> 01:09:51.585
I think it's time to go,
don't you?

01:11:18.974 --> 01:11:21.775
<i> Just let it out.</i>

01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:23.043
Say what you've gotta say.

01:11:23.045 --> 01:11:25.612
Well, I guess I have spent

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:29.316
the last three years of my life
being terrified.

01:11:29.318 --> 01:11:33.654
- Three years.
- Just paralyzed by fear.

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:34.455
Fear.

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:35.889
I feel pressured by my parents

01:11:35.891 --> 01:11:39.226
to always live up
to some kind of expectation.

01:11:39.228 --> 01:11:42.763
Parents. Let me stop you there.

01:11:42.765 --> 01:11:46.300
Three years, fear, parents.

01:11:47.369 --> 01:11:51.338
- That's what I said.
- That's what it is.

01:11:51.873 --> 01:11:55.509
But then I have met cherie.

01:11:55.511 --> 01:11:57.644
She's a good person.

01:11:57.646 --> 01:11:59.246
She changed everything.

01:11:59.248 --> 01:12:03.183
She's just a better person.
She makes me a better person.

01:12:03.185 --> 01:12:06.387
- Yeah.
- And...

01:12:06.621 --> 01:12:10.724
- I think I'm in love with her.
- At last.

01:12:10.726 --> 01:12:14.995
To think that she might even
feel the same back, I just...

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:15.963
Oh, god.

01:12:15.965 --> 01:12:18.098
The only way you're ever
gonna find out

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.266
is by doing something about it.

01:12:19.268 --> 01:12:24.238
And last night was not
how you go about these things.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:25.005
I've ruined it.

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:26.206
All you need to do

01:12:26.208 --> 01:12:28.909
is get to the hotel
and tell her how you feel.

01:12:28.911 --> 01:12:32.513
Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait. What
do you mean, hotel? What hotel?

01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:34.882
She's gone to that hotel
with that oaf Gary.

01:12:34.884 --> 01:12:36.350
And she's there
for the next week.

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:38.719
And if you don't do something
now, you're never going to.

01:12:38.721 --> 01:12:41.955
Now's your chance. You need to
find the hero inside yourself.

01:12:41.957 --> 01:12:44.091
You need to climb
inside that hero

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:47.061
and then you need
to let that hero free.

01:12:47.063 --> 01:12:48.695
Go, Noel, go.

01:12:48.697 --> 01:12:51.065
- There's no time to waste.
- Thank you.

01:13:09.652 --> 01:13:10.851
<i> How...</i>

01:13:10.853 --> 01:13:12.052
How could you do this to me?

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:14.455
- How could you do this to me?
- Want me to help you run them?

01:13:14.457 --> 01:13:18.792
No, it's fine. I think
I'm kind of better on my own.

01:13:18.794 --> 01:13:21.295
What? No, no, no.

01:13:21.297 --> 01:13:23.530
Three noes,
honestly, three noes.

01:13:23.532 --> 01:13:25.165
They've put "no, no, no".

01:13:25.167 --> 01:13:27.835
Who says that? No, no, no.

01:13:27.837 --> 01:13:29.536
I'm not gonna make that work.

01:13:29.538 --> 01:13:30.938
What do you take me for? A mug?

01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:34.541
What do you take me for? A mug?
What do you...

01:13:34.543 --> 01:13:37.978
What d'you take me for? A mug?

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:40.347
These scripts are just getting
worse and worse.

01:13:40.349 --> 01:13:43.350
You say to them, you say,
"Steve wouldn't say that."

01:13:43.352 --> 01:13:45.452
But they don't listen to you,
you know.

01:13:45.454 --> 01:13:47.888
You end up,
they get these writers in

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:50.390
who are just, you know,
they're in for a week,

01:13:50.392 --> 01:13:52.960
they don't know the back story
of the character

01:13:52.962 --> 01:13:56.730
and I have to say lines like,
"what d'you take me for? A mug?"

01:14:15.316 --> 01:14:17.351
<i> Do you honestly
 expect me to believe</i>

01:14:17.353 --> 01:14:18.919
you didn't know
anything about the fire?

01:14:18.921 --> 01:14:23.790
- Oh, Christ.
- I've started writing music.

01:14:24.292 --> 01:14:26.160
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:14:26.162 --> 01:14:29.596
And I like it.
I think I'm quite good at it.

01:14:29.598 --> 01:14:35.869
What d'you expect me to do?
What d'you expect me to do?

01:14:42.444 --> 01:14:44.011
What were you saying?
Writing what?

01:14:44.013 --> 01:14:46.580
- I'm writing music.
- Music?

01:14:46.582 --> 01:14:49.917
- Yeah.
- What kind of music?

01:14:49.919 --> 01:14:54.087
- Kind of indie, folky...

01:14:54.089 --> 01:14:55.856
- Indie folky?
- Yeah.

01:14:55.858 --> 01:15:00.093
- Is that your kind of thing?
- Yeah, it's my kind of thing.

01:15:02.797 --> 01:15:03.730
Oh, the signal here.

01:15:03.732 --> 01:15:08.502
I've got a message through from
John, but I can't reply to it.

01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:11.505
For fuck's sake.

01:15:16.544 --> 01:15:19.279
Do you wanna play a game?

01:15:19.914 --> 01:15:21.448
A game?

01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:22.583
What kind of game?

01:15:22.585 --> 01:15:26.620
You have that one
and I have this one,

01:15:26.622 --> 01:15:28.288
and we count down,
three, two, one,

01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:30.824
and then we peel them and see
who does it the quickest

01:15:30.826 --> 01:15:33.360
and then
who does it the quickest wins.

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:36.964
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:15:37.799 --> 01:15:42.069
Shit. I've got peel on my...
On my shirt.

01:15:42.071 --> 01:15:43.870
Fucking hell.
I bet they don't...

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:48.742
I bet it costs a fortune to get
stuff laundered here as well.

01:16:04.092 --> 01:16:07.227
Hi. Um, sorry. Uh...
I'm looking for cherie.

01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:09.663
- Cherie?
- She's with Gary Greene.

01:16:09.665 --> 01:16:12.766
Gary Greene?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Room one.

01:16:12.768 --> 01:16:15.302
I've got a tape that it's really
important that she gets it.

01:16:15.304 --> 01:16:18.472
That is old school.
Yeah, it's no problem.

01:16:18.474 --> 01:16:20.674
- Gary Greene.
- Sorry, not for Gary.

01:16:20.676 --> 01:16:22.643
That's for cherie,
the blonde girl.

01:16:22.645 --> 01:16:25.178
Yeah, no worries, no problem.
All sorted.

01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:27.614
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:16:27.616 --> 01:16:30.817
Thanks. It is really important.

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:34.688
Yeah, alright.

01:16:38.993 --> 01:16:42.296
He's spelled cherry wrong.

01:16:56.144 --> 01:16:57.844
<i> Well, tell them no.</i>

01:16:57.846 --> 01:17:00.180
I don't wanna do a personal
appearance in a nightclub.

01:17:00.182 --> 01:17:05.185
Well, cos it's tacky as fuck.
How much are they paying?

01:17:05.187 --> 01:17:07.587
Mr Greene, morning.
How are we, sir?

01:17:07.589 --> 01:17:10.457
Um, I'm fine, thanks.
Sorry, what's your name?

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:12.159
- Ben.
- Ben, Ben, Ben.

01:17:12.161 --> 01:17:14.027
- Steve.
- Yeah, thanks. Well, it's Gary.

01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:15.228
Is there any mail for room one?

01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:18.899
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I'm expecting a script.

01:17:18.901 --> 01:17:24.237
Oh, right. Oh, a guy came here,
red jacket, coat...

01:17:24.239 --> 01:17:26.406
- Yeah.
- A tape.

01:17:26.408 --> 01:17:28.041
- A tape.
- It's like '80s or something.

01:17:28.043 --> 01:17:31.044
"Song for cherie."
Yeah, I'll have that.

01:17:31.046 --> 01:17:33.280
Thanks for the tape.
I'll see you later.

01:17:33.282 --> 01:17:34.981
Cool, man.

01:18:05.948 --> 01:18:09.349
Can I get a gin and tonic,
please? What do you want?

01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:12.219
Can I just get a coffee?
Thank you so much.

01:18:12.221 --> 01:18:16.456
Don't just say coffee.
What kind of coffee do you want?

01:18:17.392 --> 01:18:20.961
Just wondering whether I should
up my Twitter profile a bit.

01:18:20.963 --> 01:18:25.098
But I've got, like,
over 100,000 followers now.

01:18:25.666 --> 01:18:28.602
Your battery must wear down
so quickly.

01:18:28.604 --> 01:18:29.770
You're constantly on that phone.

01:18:29.772 --> 01:18:34.341
- It's a pain in the arse.
- Yeah, it's a pain in the arse.

01:20:07.903 --> 01:20:10.837
- Have you got everything?
- Yeah, I think so.

01:20:10.839 --> 01:20:12.572
Yeah.

01:20:15.643 --> 01:20:17.677
Noel! Noel!

01:20:17.679 --> 01:20:19.779
Did you not get the tape?

01:20:19.781 --> 01:20:21.181
- What tape?
- He wrote you a song.

01:20:21.183 --> 01:20:23.116
A song for Christmas.
Did you not get it?

01:20:23.118 --> 01:20:25.519
- It's a beautiful song.
- Where did he take it?

01:20:25.521 --> 01:20:28.788
- He said he gave it to gazza.
- What, this?

01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:31.024
There was some tape left
at the hotel.

01:20:31.026 --> 01:20:34.094
- Yeah, that's...
- He made this for you?

01:20:34.096 --> 01:20:36.162
He's made you a tape?
How old is he? 12?

01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:37.931
Just give it to me. It's mine.

01:20:37.933 --> 01:20:39.065
Who makes fucking tapes?

01:20:39.067 --> 01:20:40.467
Why is he making you tapes?

01:20:40.469 --> 01:20:42.836
- Here's a tape! Here's a tape!
- No!

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:45.038
Have the tape!

01:22:19.967 --> 01:22:21.501
Oh!

01:22:26.741 --> 01:22:30.543
<i>That song from teen wolf
where he grew the thing.</i>

01:22:39.553 --> 01:22:43.390
Ok, now, it's five seconds
to the new year.

01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:46.993
Four! Three!

01:22:46.995 --> 01:22:49.529
Two! One!

01:22:49.531 --> 01:22:52.732
Banzai!

01:23:06.247 --> 01:23:08.548
<i> - Happy new year!
- Hey!</i>

01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:10.450
<i>- Happy new year!
 - Darling.</i>

01:23:10.452 --> 01:23:12.452
You look good.

01:23:12.454 --> 01:23:13.653
<i> Are you alright?</i>

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:14.654
Yeah, I'm good, thank you.

01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:16.823
<i> And how was last night?
 Good party?</i>

01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:19.559
<i>- Yeah, really good party.
 - Oh.</i>

01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:23.930
I need to introduce you
to someone.

01:23:23.932 --> 01:23:25.799
<i>- Whoop!
 - Well, hello.</i>

01:23:25.801 --> 01:23:27.600
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:23:27.602 --> 01:23:29.569
<i> - Who are you?
- I'm cherie.</i>

01:23:29.571 --> 01:23:31.204
This is cherie.
This is my parents.

01:23:31.206 --> 01:23:32.372
<i> Hi, cherie.</i>

01:23:32.374 --> 01:23:34.674
- Jack and penny.
- Hi, Jack and penny.

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:35.909
<i> She's very pretty. How? How?</i>

01:23:35.911 --> 01:23:39.145
- Wit and charm.
- Cos he's the best around.

01:23:39.147 --> 01:23:41.481
<i>- Yeah.
 - Wit and charm?</i>

01:23:41.483 --> 01:23:44.017
<i> - Ok, so...
 - So you've... you've...</i>

01:23:44.019 --> 01:23:47.454
<i> - Are you sort of together?
 - Together?</i>

01:23:47.456 --> 01:23:49.355
<i> - Are you?
- Yeah.</i>

01:23:49.357 --> 01:23:51.791
<i> - Have you got it together yet?
 - High five!</i>

01:23:51.793 --> 01:23:54.427
<i>- There you are.
- No, fair play, Noel.</i>

01:23:54.429 --> 01:23:57.664
She's... you're batting way
above your average there, mate.

01:23:57.666 --> 01:24:00.300
<i> - Fair play to you.
 - She's not out of his league.</i>

01:24:00.302 --> 01:24:03.903
<i> No, of course not. She's really
 pretty, though, isn't she?</i>

01:24:03.905 --> 01:24:06.606
<i>- Alright, dad.
 - Yes, darling, she is pretty.</i>

01:24:06.608 --> 01:24:09.109
<i>- No, they do this.
 - I think I...</i>

01:24:10.579 --> 01:24:12.045
<i> You've got your father
 going now.</i>

01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:15.615
<i> Oh, yeah.
 Come here, you. Hang on.</i>

01:24:15.617 --> 01:24:19.018
<i> - Hang on.
 - Ok, ok, sweetheart.</i>

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:23.189
- They seem lovely.
- They are lovely.
