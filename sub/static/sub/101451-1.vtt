WEBVTT

00:55.572 --> 00:57.507
Em? Darlin'?

04:56.180 --> 04:57.748
Get.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.969
Kill me. Kill me.

06:39.216 --> 06:40.785
Now, don't you worry, girl.

06:43.687 --> 06:45.256
I will accommodate you.

07:04.175 --> 07:05.843
No!

08:46.043 --> 08:49.847
I often ponder
the depths of your loyalty.

08:51.315 --> 08:52.883
Prove me wrong.

08:56.320 --> 08:57.888
Say your name, girl.

09:01.825 --> 09:03.160
Say your name.

09:22.880 --> 09:26.083
It brings me no joy
to do this.

09:31.989 --> 09:34.158
Silence!

09:34.191 --> 09:36.894
You will speak only when
I instruct you to speak.

09:40.064 --> 09:41.966
I am responsible
for you now,

09:41.999 --> 09:44.335
and I will tame
your savage ways.

09:47.171 --> 09:49.106
- Now, get up.
- No, no!

09:49.139 --> 09:51.308
Come on.

09:54.011 --> 09:55.412
Say your name, girl.

09:59.450 --> 10:01.885
Comply!

10:04.355 --> 10:06.156
You've given me no choice.

10:17.067 --> 10:19.036
Now, please stand up for me.

10:19.069 --> 10:21.939
No, no, no!

10:21.972 --> 10:25.209
No, no, no, no, no!

10:27.111 --> 10:29.546
Your friends are dead
because of you.

10:29.580 --> 10:30.814
You know that, right?

10:32.950 --> 10:34.585
Try to escape again,

10:34.618 --> 10:36.920
I'll drag you
to the burn shed myself.

10:55.272 --> 10:59.343
Now, let's try this again.

11:02.646 --> 11:04.381
Say your name, girl.

11:06.150 --> 11:07.918
Eden.

11:09.019 --> 11:10.187
Eden.

11:10.220 --> 11:13.057
Say your name
with pride and conviction!

11:14.091 --> 11:18.529
Eden.
My name is Eden.

11:21.666 --> 11:24.902
That's good, Eden.
Real good.

11:27.171 --> 11:29.606
Everything will be
all right now, and, uh,

11:32.609 --> 11:34.511
you can stop
that cryin'.

11:51.628 --> 11:54.231
Maybe I can get away
for supper tomorrow.

11:54.264 --> 11:56.166
You can make us a chicken.

13:27.191 --> 13:29.460
Y'all seem easily distracted.

13:32.396 --> 13:34.398
Why don't we break up
this monotony

13:34.431 --> 13:35.767
and get y'all focused?

13:37.669 --> 13:39.369
Go on, sing us somethin'.

13:41.038 --> 13:44.041
Perhaps one of those
old Negro tunes.

13:56.520 --> 13:59.757
We need to move.
These fuckers is crazy.

14:08.999 --> 14:11.703
Next time,
I won't be so generous.

14:15.339 --> 14:17.341
Back to work. All of you!

14:18.710 --> 14:20.678
Let the sound
of Confederate victory

14:20.712 --> 14:22.513
bring joy to your labor.

15:05.422 --> 15:07.190
Milk, chicken.

15:07.224 --> 15:09.192
We must try again.

15:13.865 --> 15:17.100
- Get down. Get down!
- Get off there. Come on.

15:17.134 --> 15:21.104
- Get off the wagon.
- Move! Get out of here!

15:21.138 --> 15:24.174
What you lookin' at?
Line up. Come on!

15:24.207 --> 15:25.242
Hurry!

15:26.010 --> 15:28.746
Line up!
Get over there.

15:29.580 --> 15:34.551
Eden! Get your ass
down here, girl!

15:38.923 --> 15:41.525
Separate yourself.
Turn.

15:48.398 --> 15:49.867
Look at her hair.

15:51.703 --> 15:53.236
Quite a beauty.

15:54.371 --> 15:56.139
Shall we
name her, child?

15:56.173 --> 15:58.241
Mmm... Let's name
her Julia.

15:58.275 --> 15:59.376
Hmm.

16:00.344 --> 16:01.645
You hear that?

16:05.349 --> 16:07.417
Those are worker hands.

16:08.485 --> 16:09.887
You're dismissed.

16:16.861 --> 16:17.862
Well,

16:19.697 --> 16:21.632
welcome home, one and all.

16:23.567 --> 16:26.236
Now, listen up! All of you.

16:29.907 --> 16:33.610
This here
is a reformer plantation

16:33.644 --> 16:35.880
commandeered
by the Ninth Infantry

16:35.913 --> 16:38.649
of the Confederate Army
of the 13 states.

16:41.485 --> 16:43.487
Wherever you were before,

16:45.723 --> 16:49.559
whatever small freedoms
you might have enjoyed,

16:50.895 --> 16:53.196
I'm here to tell you
that's over.

16:54.732 --> 16:58.803
I don't tolerate any back talk
whatsoever from inferiors.

17:00.504 --> 17:04.976
In fact,
on this plantation,

17:05.009 --> 17:08.680
you will only speak when
given permission to do so.

17:10.948 --> 17:12.449
That means

17:13.851 --> 17:18.288
absolutely no talking
among yourselves

17:18.321 --> 17:21.224
unless one of the white folk
on property...

17:22.559 --> 17:24.762
...gives you permission
to do so.

17:27.865 --> 17:29.466
If you do...

17:30.467 --> 17:31.468
Oh.

17:32.502 --> 17:33.738
We will know about it.

17:36.540 --> 17:39.443
Over here,
you will find your cabins.

17:39.476 --> 17:41.012
You will also
be given instructions

17:41.045 --> 17:42.579
by one of the overseers

17:42.612 --> 17:44.648
as to your daily duties,

17:44.682 --> 17:46.784
which ought to be
followed obediently

17:49.754 --> 17:51.421
and with a smile.

17:54.424 --> 17:56.861
Here, we whistle
while we work.

17:56.894 --> 17:58.696
Ain't that right, Eli?

18:01.032 --> 18:02.566
Raise the flag,
Corporal.

18:02.599 --> 18:04.001
The general will be
home this evening.

18:05.036 --> 18:06.838
You're dismissed.

18:06.871 --> 18:07.872
Get.

18:08.906 --> 18:10.742
Go on. Walk, now.

18:11.575 --> 18:14.444
Get on. Let's go, move.

18:14.478 --> 18:16.480
Hey, what is this?

18:16.513 --> 18:17.849
Quiet!

18:17.882 --> 18:19.549
Go, now!

18:19.583 --> 18:22.019
Mmm. You started early.

19:26.616 --> 19:27.919
When?

20:02.787 --> 20:04.487
How many...

20:06.891 --> 20:08.391
Get in here.

20:14.165 --> 20:15.967
You're from
Virginia, right?

20:21.072 --> 20:22.907
I'm from North Carolina.

20:28.746 --> 20:30.513
Look, I can't do this.

20:31.816 --> 20:33.117
Whatever you're doin',

20:33.150 --> 20:34.551
I can't do it.

20:34.986 --> 20:37.121
Listen to me.

20:37.154 --> 20:39.824
Wherever you came from
before here,

20:39.857 --> 20:42.626
- you need to forget about it.
- Mmm-mmm.

20:42.660 --> 20:44.829
That is not possible for me.

20:47.765 --> 20:49.432
What are we doin'?

20:51.568 --> 20:55.773
Huh? What is the plan?

20:55.806 --> 20:57.540
You think I haven't tried?

21:10.922 --> 21:14.191
We must choose
our moment wisely.

21:17.194 --> 21:19.496
But until then,

21:19.529 --> 21:24.567
we keep our heads down
and our mouths shut.

21:24.601 --> 21:27.570
Do you understand me?

21:31.709 --> 21:33.510
I know you.

21:36.047 --> 21:41.018
And I know that you are
my only way out of here.

21:50.828 --> 21:52.462
I'm pregnant.

22:05.876 --> 22:07.912
I need you to listen to me.

22:09.213 --> 22:11.882
You have to keep quiet.

22:11.916 --> 22:13.851
These white people
will kill you.

22:13.884 --> 22:16.087
Oh, you think being quiet
is being strong, huh?

22:19.223 --> 22:21.591
What has that
ever gotten us?

22:30.067 --> 22:32.036
You ain't no leader.

22:33.971 --> 22:36.173
You're just a talker.

22:36.207 --> 22:38.541
Ain't that right, huh?

22:40.044 --> 22:41.912
You... Hey!

22:42.780 --> 22:44.715
What, you just
a coward nigger slave

22:44.749 --> 22:46.083
with a brand
and no backbone?

22:53.657 --> 22:55.259
Blood and soil.

22:55.292 --> 22:58.796
Blood and soil.
Blood and soil.

23:44.809 --> 23:46.010
As you were.

23:48.312 --> 23:49.947
First,

23:50.915 --> 23:52.149
I want to congratulate you

23:52.183 --> 23:55.119
on our defeat of the Yanks
at Milliken's.

23:57.121 --> 24:00.724
This is what
victory looks like!

24:07.698 --> 24:10.968
We got those blue-bellied
bastards on their heels,

24:11.001 --> 24:13.270
Washington in our sights.

24:15.840 --> 24:18.175
But we must never relent.

24:22.947 --> 24:24.949
We are descendants
of the gods

24:26.383 --> 24:27.351
and we will fight

24:27.384 --> 24:30.688
with the same immeasurable
courage and vigor.

24:32.857 --> 24:35.392
We will sacrifice our blood

24:36.727 --> 24:39.196
and fertilize this soil
of our homeland.

24:40.865 --> 24:43.901
This is the only hope we have

24:43.934 --> 24:48.172
of retaining our heritage,
our way of life.

24:52.309 --> 24:54.912
This land
was always ours.

24:56.714 --> 24:59.250
It is our
rightful inheritance.

25:01.218 --> 25:04.688
And, rest assured,
our nationalist state

25:04.722 --> 25:10.394
will not be stolen from us
by these traitors to America.

25:12.730 --> 25:16.333
I have faith in this
because I have faith in you.

25:18.302 --> 25:20.171
You all are the future.

25:20.938 --> 25:22.439
And it is you

25:23.874 --> 25:28.112
who will lead us all
to the ultimate victory.

25:29.947 --> 25:35.286
But for tonight,
let us put away our troubles.

25:35.319 --> 25:39.156
Drink and be merry.
You've earned it. All of you.

25:39.990 --> 25:41.392
And, by the way,

25:42.927 --> 25:48.165
these Sapphires are here
to fulfill your every need,

25:48.799 --> 25:53.804
whatever those needs
may be.

25:56.040 --> 25:57.474
Faith! Family! Folk!

25:57.508 --> 25:59.076
Faith! Family! Folk!

26:05.216 --> 26:06.483
As you were.

26:12.890 --> 26:14.792
So, which one
of these girls do you like?

26:14.825 --> 26:15.859
What?

26:15.893 --> 26:16.994
Which one of these girls
do you like?

26:25.135 --> 26:26.136
Hey, angel.

26:27.471 --> 26:28.906
Yeah, you.

26:30.207 --> 26:32.109
Come here. I don't bite.

26:33.477 --> 26:34.945
Come on.

26:42.820 --> 26:44.188
My compadre here
was just telling me

26:44.221 --> 26:46.223
he thinks
you're real pretty.

26:46.257 --> 26:48.792
No, man. No.

26:48.826 --> 26:51.328
What, you don't think
she's pretty? Hmm?

26:51.362 --> 26:52.796
No, I mean...

26:54.531 --> 26:56.834
Yeah, of course I do.

26:56.867 --> 27:00.504
Well, then.
She ain't gonna say no. Hmm?

27:02.273 --> 27:03.474
Talk to her.

27:05.609 --> 27:07.177
You're in charge here.

27:15.185 --> 27:16.186
Um...

27:17.454 --> 27:19.556
Uh... I, um...

27:20.457 --> 27:21.825
Well, I...

27:21.859 --> 27:23.994
Oh, just...
Fuck's sake.

27:24.028 --> 27:25.462
He will meet you
at your cabin

27:25.496 --> 27:27.398
immediately following
dinner service.

27:28.198 --> 27:30.267
You're dismissed
as of this moment.

27:31.969 --> 27:33.337
Now, go and prepare
for your corporal.

27:37.641 --> 27:39.176
What's that, girl?

27:41.078 --> 27:42.079
Yes,

27:43.947 --> 27:45.015
sir.

27:45.582 --> 27:47.084
That's more like it.

27:52.122 --> 27:53.424
Go on, now. Go.

28:01.332 --> 28:03.267
Well, you enjoy,
all right?

28:04.601 --> 28:06.837
I'm going around back
to the whipping post.

28:26.924 --> 28:28.492
If I may?

28:30.494 --> 28:31.962
I never got
your name.

28:32.496 --> 28:34.264
Daniel. Um...

28:36.233 --> 28:38.135
It's Daniel.

28:38.168 --> 28:40.839
Well, thank you, Daniel.

28:43.407 --> 28:44.875
For earlier.

28:46.343 --> 28:49.279
You said that I was pretty.

28:52.349 --> 28:55.586
Of course you are.
Anyone can see that.

29:00.424 --> 29:01.425
It's, um...

29:02.426 --> 29:04.061
It's just been
such a long time

29:04.094 --> 29:07.231
since any man
has been nice to me.

29:08.966 --> 29:10.467
I appreciate
the compliment is all.

29:18.175 --> 29:20.077
How'd you get
to be so sweet?

29:26.417 --> 29:28.152
Look, you don't...

29:29.453 --> 29:32.389
You don't have to do this.

29:32.423 --> 29:35.159
I can tell
that you're special.

29:37.461 --> 29:40.597
You're not like the others.
Those monsters.

29:50.574 --> 29:52.943
Why'd you speak to me?

29:56.180 --> 29:58.615
You mean, when your friend
called me over before?

29:58.649 --> 30:01.118
No. Why'd you
speak to me

30:01.151 --> 30:03.020
when I entered the room
just now?

30:06.089 --> 30:07.291
Uh...

30:09.092 --> 30:14.131
I just thought we should have
a proper introduction.

30:14.164 --> 30:16.066
You have
a short memory, then.

30:17.167 --> 30:18.736
You heard
Commander Jasper.

30:18.770 --> 30:22.105
You speak only when
given permission to do so.

30:22.139 --> 30:24.742
- Is that not right?
- Yes, sir. Uh...

30:25.542 --> 30:26.711
I mean, Daniel.

30:26.744 --> 30:28.579
No. It's "sir"!

30:32.817 --> 30:36.119
You don't know shit!
You don't know shit!

30:36.153 --> 30:37.154
Okay.

30:38.756 --> 30:42.059
I'm as much a Confederate
as any man here.

30:42.092 --> 30:43.126
Because I don't wanna sleep

30:43.160 --> 30:45.229
with no filthy fucking mongrel

30:45.262 --> 30:49.233
instead of my own kind,
that don't make me no...

30:49.266 --> 30:51.635
I'm... I'm a patriot!
You understand me?

30:53.370 --> 30:54.772
Shut the fuck up!

30:54.806 --> 30:56.340
Shut up!

30:58.609 --> 31:00.611
You're lucky
I don't tell Jasper.

31:00.644 --> 31:02.279
You better make him believe
I had my way with you

31:02.312 --> 31:03.380
if you know what's good
for you.

31:03.413 --> 31:04.448
You understand me?

31:04.481 --> 31:06.450
Get off of me.

31:07.451 --> 31:09.286
Uh...

31:40.183 --> 31:44.521
Well, you're forgiven
your tardiness, this time.

31:44.555 --> 31:46.724
Don't make it a habit,
or the stocks will be waitin'.

32:02.707 --> 32:04.474
Are you okay?

32:07.344 --> 32:08.478
Please...

32:09.479 --> 32:13.617
I know. Be patient.

32:13.651 --> 32:16.688
Just keep goin'.
We have to keep goin'.

32:20.157 --> 32:22.125
Oh, no!

32:22.159 --> 32:25.128
No! No, no, no!

32:33.938 --> 32:36.708
No!

32:36.741 --> 32:39.376
- Oh, no! No!
- It's okay.

32:39.409 --> 32:41.111
It's not okay!

32:51.455 --> 32:52.456
Cracker!

32:55.927 --> 32:57.795
The fuck
you just say, boy?

33:03.567 --> 33:05.703
Oh, I'm gonna be
right back for you.

33:05.737 --> 33:07.170
Hyah.

33:07.204 --> 33:09.841
What the fuck is the issue?

33:09.874 --> 33:11.676
She's sick, sir.

33:11.709 --> 33:13.477
Oh, no...

33:13.510 --> 33:16.513
Oh... Go on.
Go get yourself cleaned up.

33:16.546 --> 33:17.749
May I go with her?

33:17.782 --> 33:20.350
She can handle herself.
Get back to work.

33:20.384 --> 33:21.886
Sir...

33:23.286 --> 33:25.222
Oh.

33:25.255 --> 33:28.392
Fine. Go clean her up,
get back here.

33:42.707 --> 33:44.307
Take hold of him.

33:46.410 --> 33:47.477
It's okay, boy.

33:54.551 --> 33:55.552
Now,

33:58.890 --> 34:00.624
what was that
you were sayin',

34:03.761 --> 34:04.762
boy?

34:11.703 --> 34:12.737
Oh.

34:14.404 --> 34:15.773
You missing your woman?

34:20.444 --> 34:21.813
Give me an excuse.

34:23.480 --> 34:24.581
Go on.

34:28.753 --> 34:29.754
No.

34:32.556 --> 34:35.993
Why, that reminds me,
the shed needs cleanin'.

34:37.627 --> 34:40.932
Too many foolish Negroes
with rebellious hearts.

34:44.702 --> 34:48.371
Yeah. Go get that
cleaned up, boy.

34:48.405 --> 34:50.474
That should stop you
flappin' them gums.

34:55.947 --> 34:56.981
Yes,

34:58.916 --> 34:59.951
sir.

35:01.518 --> 35:02.653
Yes, sir.

35:05.422 --> 35:06.623
Go on, get.

35:14.464 --> 35:16.533
Cracker-ass cracker.

37:55.092 --> 37:56.827
Sweet dreams, Eden.

38:35.700 --> 38:36.801
Good morning, Steph.

38:36.834 --> 38:37.902
<i>Good morning, V.</i>

38:37.935 --> 38:39.737
<i>Just making sure
you're ready for your flight.</i>

38:39.770 --> 38:40.972
<i>Skype is at 8:45,</i>

38:41.005 --> 38:42.707
<i>and the car will be there
at 9:00.</i>

38:42.740 --> 38:45.642
- Oh, shit. Okay. All right.
- <i>Okay.</i>

38:45.676 --> 38:47.510
- Thanks, Steph. Bye.
- <i>Safe travels.</i>

38:52.817 --> 38:54.151
Another bad dream?

38:54.652 --> 38:58.189
No. I'm... I'm okay.

38:59.924 --> 39:04.128
Babe? Can you
please do me a favor?

39:04.161 --> 39:05.997
Anything.

39:06.030 --> 39:08.699
Can you get Ken Ken
dressed for me today?

39:08.733 --> 39:10.935
Of course. Mmm-hmm.

39:10.968 --> 39:13.671
My first meeting is
right here in Georgetown

39:13.704 --> 39:16.273
and it got pushed
to 11:00 anyway, so...

39:16.307 --> 39:17.574
Okay.

39:18.075 --> 39:20.044
I don't know.

39:20.077 --> 39:24.315
I'm not gonna even be
dressed before 9:00.

39:24.348 --> 39:27.184
- I got you. I got you.
- Thank you, babe.

39:28.953 --> 39:32.990
But would it be the
worst thing in the world

39:33.024 --> 39:34.557
if you didn't make it?

39:39.997 --> 39:41.799
Not today.
Not today.

39:41.832 --> 39:44.735
There she is.

39:44.769 --> 39:46.771
My favorite girl.

39:46.804 --> 39:49.240
- Guess what?
- What?

39:49.273 --> 39:52.243
Daddy is gonna get
you dressed for school today.

39:52.276 --> 39:56.313
I know exactly
what I want to wear.

39:56.347 --> 39:57.748
You do?

39:57.782 --> 39:59.050
- Hurry up.
- I'm comin', girl.

39:59.083 --> 40:00.084
- She said "Hurry," Daddy.
- I'm hurryin'...

40:00.117 --> 40:01.786
I'm hurryin'.

40:01.819 --> 40:03.120
- Hurry up.
- You're gonna pull

40:03.154 --> 40:04.155
my arm off.

40:04.889 --> 40:06.824
Okay, okay, okay.

40:06.857 --> 40:08.159
What you wearin' today?

40:32.316 --> 40:34.685
Well,
look at you two.

40:34.718 --> 40:35.920
Look at you.

40:35.953 --> 40:38.122
Mommy loves that dress.

40:38.155 --> 40:40.825
Excellent
choice, baby.

40:40.858 --> 40:42.326
Yeah, she picked it.

40:42.359 --> 40:45.296
- Hi, babe.
- You stay trendin'.

40:45.329 --> 40:48.299
Paused it for you.

40:48.332 --> 40:51.769
<i>I understand
you think you are defending</i>

40:51.802 --> 40:53.636
<i>the plight of the black man.</i>

40:53.671 --> 40:56.140
<i>I guess, in your case,
the black woman.</i>

40:56.173 --> 40:58.943
<i>But we are doing a disservice
to the argument,</i>

40:58.976 --> 41:00.678
<i>much less your people...</i>

41:00.711 --> 41:04.782
<i>by conflating race
with basic common sense.</i>

41:04.815 --> 41:06.884
<i>I would say this.</i>

41:06.917 --> 41:09.753
<i>The disenfranchisement
of black people in America</i>

41:09.787 --> 41:10.821
<i>is by design,</i>

41:10.855 --> 41:13.657
<i>written into the actual DNA
of this country.</i>

41:13.691 --> 41:15.893
<i>Your argument,
however flawed</i>

41:15.926 --> 41:17.695
<i>has been successfully promoted</i>

41:17.728 --> 41:19.230
<i>and propagated
through repetition.</i>

41:19.263 --> 41:22.099
<i>We hear it over
and over again.</i>

41:22.133 --> 41:23.334
<i>But I'm here to tell you</i>

41:23.367 --> 41:25.836
<i>that this vicious cycle
of inequity</i>

41:25.870 --> 41:27.371
<i>will soon be broken.</i>

41:28.706 --> 41:30.207
- Boom!
- Boom!

41:30.241 --> 41:31.275
- Boom!
- Boom!

41:31.308 --> 41:32.977
Boom!

41:33.010 --> 41:36.247
Mommy, why was
that man so angry?

41:36.280 --> 41:40.184
Oh, baby,
that is a really great question.

41:45.055 --> 41:48.893
Sometimes
what looks like anger

41:48.926 --> 41:52.062
is really just fear.

41:52.096 --> 41:55.199
Things are not always
what they appear to be, baby.

41:55.232 --> 41:56.333
Does that make sense?

41:58.802 --> 42:02.406
Do you remember when Vanessa
was bullying you at school?

42:02.439 --> 42:03.941
She was pickin' on you?

42:03.974 --> 42:05.075
And Mommy had to
come up there

42:05.109 --> 42:06.310
because Vanessa thought

42:06.343 --> 42:08.245
that you were gonna
come in class

42:08.279 --> 42:10.814
and take
all of her toys away.

42:10.848 --> 42:12.983
And now you two
are like best friends.

42:14.818 --> 42:17.221
So, are you two
friends yet?

42:22.826 --> 42:23.827
Not yet, baby.

42:24.495 --> 42:26.697
Mommy's working on it.

42:56.927 --> 42:58.395
Pancake?

42:58.429 --> 43:00.764
Pancake?
On a Tuesday?

43:01.498 --> 43:03.534
What is the special occasion?

43:03.567 --> 43:05.169
Well, I was informed

43:05.202 --> 43:07.438
it was pancakes or nothing,
so, you know,

43:07.471 --> 43:08.973
we gotta pick our battles.

43:09.006 --> 43:11.108
Um, question,
are we vegan this week?

43:12.209 --> 43:16.547
Babe, the struggle
is real.

43:16.580 --> 43:21.252
Got it. So, one non-vegan
pancake coming up.

43:21.285 --> 43:24.255
Babe, no. I cannot.

43:34.265 --> 43:35.899
Elizabeth?

43:35.933 --> 43:39.270
<i>Yes. Dr. Henley.</i>

43:39.303 --> 43:43.307
Hi. And please call me Veronica.

43:43.340 --> 43:44.875
How are you this morning?

43:44.908 --> 43:46.443
<i>Oh, I'm fine.</i>

43:46.477 --> 43:49.880
<i>That lipstick just looks
lovely on you.</i>

43:51.015 --> 43:53.484
<i>It suits your skin tone.</i>

43:53.517 --> 43:56.420
<i>I don't think I could
pull it off.</i>

43:58.155 --> 44:00.824
So, do you have
any questions for me?

44:00.858 --> 44:02.393
How did you
come across my work?

44:02.426 --> 44:06.297
<i>Oh, I saw you on one of
those legacy media networks.</i>

44:06.330 --> 44:10.434
<i>I believe it was a roundtable
discussion about inclusion.</i>

44:12.002 --> 44:13.570
<i>You were so articulate.</i>

44:13.604 --> 44:17.107
<i>It must have been
a ratings bonanza.</i>

44:17.141 --> 44:21.245
Those particular segments
do garner a lot of attention.

44:21.278 --> 44:22.212
I don't mean to be curt,

44:22.246 --> 44:25.015
but do you have any questions
around the book?

44:25.649 --> 44:29.086
<i>Oh. Your book.</i>

44:30.454 --> 44:31.989
<i>Yes, I believe
you mentioned it</i>

44:32.022 --> 44:34.591
<i>on that show that you were on.</i>

44:34.625 --> 44:38.062
<i>As a matter of fact,
I know you mentioned it.</i>

44:38.095 --> 44:39.530
<i>'Cause I thought
it was rather odd</i>

44:39.563 --> 44:44.501
<i>that you chose that moment
to be peddlin' your wares.</i>

44:44.535 --> 44:47.438
Well, actually,
that particular segment

44:47.471 --> 44:50.541
focused on the lack
of inclusion.

44:50.574 --> 44:53.544
And that is exactly
what my book highlights.

44:53.577 --> 44:57.981
Intersectionality of race,
class, and gender.

44:58.015 --> 45:00.250
I wrote
<i>Shedding the Coping Persona</i>

45:00.284 --> 45:04.054
as a road map to revolution

45:04.088 --> 45:06.557
for historically
marginalized people.

45:06.590 --> 45:08.660
Maybe I didn't catch
this earlier,

45:08.693 --> 45:10.427
but who did you say
you were with again?

45:10.461 --> 45:12.463
<i>I didn't mention it.</i>

45:12.496 --> 45:14.666
<i>I'm a bit of a talent scout.</i>

45:14.699 --> 45:18.469
Oh. So, you're a headhunter.
That makes sense.

45:18.502 --> 45:20.571
<i>I'm a headhunter.</i>

45:23.974 --> 45:26.210
<i>Exactly that.</i>

45:26.243 --> 45:27.478
<i>Oh.</i>

45:28.345 --> 45:30.447
<i>Now, is that Kennedi?</i>

45:30.481 --> 45:34.418
<i>Will you move the camera over?
Oh. She's so cute.</i>

45:34.451 --> 45:35.687
<i>She'll make
a perfect little companion</i>

45:35.720 --> 45:36.954
<i>for my daughter.</i>

45:36.987 --> 45:39.623
<i>I see a playdate
in our future.</i>

45:39.657 --> 45:41.492
As my assistant
mentioned earlier,

45:41.525 --> 45:43.927
I am short on time
this morning.

45:43.961 --> 45:45.697
<i>Oh, no problem. I didn't
mean to trigger you none.</i>

45:45.730 --> 45:48.165
<i>You have fun at your summit,
and I'll see you soon.</i>

45:48.198 --> 45:50.300
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

45:54.204 --> 45:57.107
- Who was that?
- Oh, baby.

45:57.141 --> 45:58.942
It's nobody.

45:58.976 --> 46:01.512
Don't worry
about that woman, okay?

46:01.545 --> 46:03.113
Okay.

46:03.147 --> 46:05.082
That's my car.

46:05.115 --> 46:07.084
I can't even imagine what
y'all are about to get into.

46:07.117 --> 46:09.520
- Obviously.
- Mommy, wait.

46:09.553 --> 46:11.121
- I'll call you. I love you.
- I almost forgot.

46:11.155 --> 46:12.657
This is for you.

46:12.690 --> 46:15.092
Oh, baby.

46:15.125 --> 46:17.528
This is for Mommy?

46:17.561 --> 46:21.999
Ken Ken, I'm putting this
with all my important work.

46:22.032 --> 46:27.137
When you look in the sky
and you see that big airplane,

46:27.171 --> 46:30.007
you'll know that's Mommy,
comin' home to you.

46:30.040 --> 46:32.576
- Wow. That's a big head.
- Daddy. Come on.

46:32.609 --> 46:34.712
It's not that big.

46:34.746 --> 46:37.314
And I'm gonna hang it
on my wall in my hotel.

46:37.347 --> 46:38.582
Yeah.

46:39.684 --> 46:41.118
- Daddy.
- Yes?

46:41.151 --> 46:42.386
Twenty minutes
of screen time.

46:42.419 --> 46:43.520
Okay.

46:43.554 --> 46:45.489
- I need you to be strong.
- We got you.

46:45.522 --> 46:47.124
Be good.

46:47.157 --> 46:51.094
Mommy loves you. Come here.
Come here. Kiss me.

46:52.730 --> 46:54.131
Give Mommy all the kisses.

46:54.164 --> 46:55.132
One minute.

46:55.165 --> 46:56.200
I'll be back, baby.
I'll be back.

46:56.233 --> 46:57.702
- Okay, okay. I love you, baby.
- Bye. Love you, babe.

46:57.735 --> 46:59.269
- All right.
- All right, be safe.

46:59.303 --> 47:00.571
I love you.
I'll be back, baby.

47:00.604 --> 47:02.639
Love you more, Mommy.

47:41.645 --> 47:44.047
Okay. Release.

47:46.550 --> 47:49.821
And as we begin to gather
our thoughts for the day,

47:49.854 --> 47:54.191
I want you to focus on
bringing positivity and light

47:54.224 --> 47:57.594
to each and every situation
you may face today.

47:58.696 --> 48:00.264
Visualize yourself

48:00.297 --> 48:03.267
addressing any obstacles
you might face

48:03.300 --> 48:05.402
with the same determination

48:05.435 --> 48:08.438
and focus that you brought
to your practice today.

48:09.573 --> 48:12.509
See yourself
emerging successful

48:12.543 --> 48:14.712
and victorious
on the other side.

48:16.848 --> 48:18.415
<i>Namaste.</i>

48:18.917 --> 48:20.617
<i>Namaste.</i>

48:21.786 --> 48:23.688
V! V, girl,
I got some tea.

48:23.721 --> 48:26.724
You better open this door
and let me come and spill it.

48:26.758 --> 48:29.761
Positivity
and light, right?

48:29.794 --> 48:30.862
V!

48:30.895 --> 48:32.129
I'm coming!

48:32.162 --> 48:34.866
No, no. Faster!

48:34.899 --> 48:37.134
I'm coming, I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming.

48:40.637 --> 48:43.440
- Hey. How are you?
- Hey, babes!

48:43.473 --> 48:44.742
- Good mornting.
- Good mornting.

48:44.776 --> 48:48.412
How is the number one
relationship specialist...

48:48.445 --> 48:49.513
- True.
- ...in the world

48:49.546 --> 48:50.614
doing this mornting, doll?

48:50.647 --> 48:53.718
Well, you know... Ooh,
it's hot. Just flourishing.

48:53.751 --> 48:56.620
You know, being amazing
and fantastic as per usual.

48:56.654 --> 48:58.622
- You're looking sharp. Yes.
- You know how I do. Thank you.

48:58.656 --> 49:02.292
Oh, hello. Why is it
so goddamn hot in here?

49:02.326 --> 49:05.562
I'm trying to create
my own version of Bikram.

49:05.596 --> 49:08.332
You know I need
all the balance I can get.

49:08.365 --> 49:10.567
Well, speaking of
balance, I saw you balance

49:10.601 --> 49:13.270
and tag that ass
last night on TV, girl.

49:14.371 --> 49:16.506
You got him
all the way together.

49:16.540 --> 49:19.376
- Bye.
- Bye. Thank you.

49:20.778 --> 49:22.747
Okay. Before we
get down to it,

49:22.780 --> 49:25.215
how is my favorite little
human in the world,

49:25.248 --> 49:26.450
Miss Kennedi?

49:26.483 --> 49:29.553
She's great. She's doing good.
Yesterday was tough, though.

49:30.855 --> 49:33.523
- It was tough.
- I just... Ugh.

49:33.557 --> 49:36.293
It breaks my heart every time
I have to leave her.

49:36.326 --> 49:37.929
Mmm. Ken Ken.

49:37.962 --> 49:40.665
I just feel like
I'm not doing enough.

49:40.698 --> 49:43.400
It's like when I'm at home,
I'm not working enough.

49:43.433 --> 49:45.535
When I'm working,
I'm not home enough.

49:45.569 --> 49:47.604
I'm not Mom enough.
I'm not wife enough.

49:47.638 --> 49:48.706
Mmm-mmm,
mmm-mmm-mmm.

49:48.740 --> 49:51.575
Okay, you listen
to me now. Okay?

49:51.608 --> 49:55.646
Yes, you're a superwoman,
but you're also a human woman.

49:55.680 --> 49:57.849
Okay? And you
are doing awesome.

49:57.882 --> 49:58.816
And Miss Kennedi,

49:58.850 --> 50:01.618
or as the world
will one day refer to her,

50:01.653 --> 50:02.619
Madam President,

50:02.654 --> 50:05.690
is living her best life
thanks to you, okay?

50:05.723 --> 50:08.458
So be nicer
to yourself, please.

50:08.492 --> 50:11.696
- Thank you. I love you.
- Mmm-hmm. I love you, too.

50:11.729 --> 50:12.830
Now...

50:13.731 --> 50:16.233
So, Camille's
hostididy ass, right?

50:16.266 --> 50:17.601
- You, girl...
- Oh, girl.

50:17.634 --> 50:19.369
- ...Camille was in the...
- Babe, I can't. I can't.

50:19.403 --> 50:20.905
I... You know
I usually would,

50:20.938 --> 50:22.539
but I have to get
to this walk-through.

50:22.572 --> 50:23.741
I'm already
runnin' behind.

50:23.775 --> 50:25.308
No, I get it.
You're too good for it today.

50:26.678 --> 50:29.446
No, I get it. You tryin' to
<i>namaste</i> in a peaceful space.

50:29.479 --> 50:31.816
And I'm about to ruin that,
so let me just see myself out.

50:31.849 --> 50:33.383
<i>♪ I love
you, I love you I love you ♪</i>

50:33.417 --> 50:35.419
You're welcome
for this free coffee.

50:35.452 --> 50:37.789
I paid $74.93 for that.

50:37.822 --> 50:40.390
- No, you did not.
- I will Cash App you.

50:40.424 --> 50:42.526
- Stop. All right.
- I will. I will. I will.

50:42.559 --> 50:43.728
All right.

50:43.761 --> 50:47.631
And I wanna remind you to
be good to yourself, okay?

50:47.665 --> 50:48.733
- Be kind to yourself.
- All right.

50:48.766 --> 50:49.801
- Be kind to my friend.
- I will.

50:49.834 --> 50:50.735
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

50:50.768 --> 50:53.270
All right, I'll see you
downstairs. Bye.

51:01.713 --> 51:02.780
Girl.

51:05.382 --> 51:06.383
Ms. Henley?

51:07.785 --> 51:09.821
- Yes?
- Delivery.

51:10.888 --> 51:12.790
Oh.

51:12.824 --> 51:14.959
The front desk
didn't even call.

51:15.793 --> 51:17.227
Who are these from?

51:57.400 --> 52:00.337
V! Oh, my God.

52:00.370 --> 52:01.304
Sarah Bee!

52:01.338 --> 52:02.974
I'm so sorry.
I did not mean to scare you.

52:03.007 --> 52:06.077
It's okay. I have just been
so jumpy this morning.

52:06.110 --> 52:07.945
I guess it's travel
or something.

52:07.979 --> 52:09.747
Okay, I love you,
but I have to run to my panel

52:09.781 --> 52:11.983
"The Exorcism of
the Unconscious Past."

52:12.016 --> 52:13.583
Ah.

52:13.617 --> 52:15.686
"The past is never dead."

52:16.553 --> 52:18.823
"It's not even past."

52:18.856 --> 52:20.624
You know,
my nana used to say,

52:20.658 --> 52:22.927
"Our ancestors
haunt our dreams

52:22.960 --> 52:24.962
"to see themselves forward."

52:24.996 --> 52:26.596
The unresolved past

52:26.630 --> 52:28.331
can certainly wreak havoc
on the present.

52:28.365 --> 52:31.368
Listen, have an amazing panel.
You're gonna be incredible.

52:31.401 --> 52:33.037
- I'll see you later, girl.
- I'll see you tonight, babe.

52:33.070 --> 52:34.371
Love you.

52:36.908 --> 52:38.375
Hi.

52:38.408 --> 52:39.643
Can I please
make a reservation

52:39.677 --> 52:41.511
at Stefano's tonight?

52:41.545 --> 52:42.546
Concierge.

52:45.049 --> 52:47.952
Of course.
Working on it as we speak.

52:51.088 --> 52:52.389
What can I do for you?

52:53.658 --> 52:56.393
May I make a reservation
for three at Stefano's?

52:56.426 --> 52:58.062
Um, let's say around 7:30.

52:58.095 --> 52:59.864
And I'm in
the Jefferson Suite.

52:59.897 --> 53:00.965
Sure.

53:04.735 --> 53:05.903
God bless.

53:20.918 --> 53:23.087
Oh, shoot.

53:23.120 --> 53:27.959
Puddin', I left my key
in the room. Do you mind?

55:21.806 --> 55:24.275
<i>You know,
I learned very quickly</i>

55:24.308 --> 55:28.746
that black people,
black women in particular,

55:28.779 --> 55:31.816
we're expected to be seen,
not heard.

55:33.284 --> 55:35.219
Or we risk being perceived

55:35.252 --> 55:37.788
as threatening
to the patriarchy.

55:37.822 --> 55:39.991
Or, God forbid,

55:40.024 --> 55:45.229
we continue to get branded as
the "angry black woman."

55:45.262 --> 55:47.098
<i>Yes.</i>

55:47.131 --> 55:51.068
So, the coping persona has
been this mode of survival

55:51.102 --> 55:54.171
for generations
of oppressed people.

55:54.205 --> 55:56.606
What I also learned
through those experiences

55:56.639 --> 56:00.911
is within our authenticity
lies our real power.

56:00.945 --> 56:01.979
Yes.

56:02.013 --> 56:04.248
And that's even
in those environments,

56:05.216 --> 56:07.151
which by design,

56:07.184 --> 56:13.691
demand our complete
and total assimilation.

56:13.724 --> 56:16.761
To the patriarchy, we've
been practically invisible.

56:18.295 --> 56:22.632
But their arrogance is
their greatest vulnerability.

56:24.201 --> 56:27.071
And our greatest opportunity.

56:27.104 --> 56:28.773
Yes.

56:31.742 --> 56:33.944
And it brings me to a quote

56:33.978 --> 56:35.746
by Assata Shakur.

56:38.249 --> 56:42.619
"The only thing
that we have to lose

56:42.653 --> 56:45.622
"are our chains."

56:46.924 --> 56:52.129
Liberation over assimilation.

56:52.163 --> 56:53.898
They're stuck in the past.

56:55.066 --> 56:57.368
- We are the future.
- Yes.

56:57.401 --> 56:59.136
Our time is now.

57:00.071 --> 57:01.305
It's now.

57:01.338 --> 57:02.740
Right now.

57:09.646 --> 57:11.682
Just a reminder,
you can pick up

57:11.715 --> 57:14.085
<i>Shedding the Coping Persona</i>
on your way out.

57:14.118 --> 57:17.655
Twenty percent
goes to HBCU schools

57:17.688 --> 57:20.157
including Louisiana's own

57:20.191 --> 57:22.159
Dillard and Southern
Universities.

57:30.234 --> 57:32.303
The way that you
talked to them, the nuance,

57:32.336 --> 57:34.171
and there's a specificity
that I just can't...

57:34.205 --> 57:36.674
Oh, my God.
That was fantastic.

57:36.707 --> 57:39.343
So sorry.
That was really great, you know.

57:39.376 --> 57:40.244
I really enjoyed
my session,

57:40.277 --> 57:41.946
but I'm really glad
I stayed for that.

57:41.979 --> 57:43.714
- Wasn't that fantastic?
- It was.

57:43.747 --> 57:45.249
- Camille, this is...
- I'm sorry, did I interrupt?

57:45.282 --> 57:46.350
- No...
- I'm gonna continue to.

57:46.383 --> 57:48.719
I really have to steal her.
Sorry to be abrupt.

57:48.752 --> 57:49.787
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

57:49.820 --> 57:50.988
Thank you again.

57:51.021 --> 57:52.356
I'm just gonna finish up
work and get back to... Bye.

57:52.389 --> 57:54.191
- Thank you, love.
- Great. Bye.

57:54.225 --> 57:56.193
- Hey.
- You're welcome.

57:56.227 --> 57:58.729
Girl, I could feel
her angling in

57:58.762 --> 58:00.231
on our dinner tonight.
And no thank you.

58:00.264 --> 58:02.133
She needs to go
sit down some place.

58:02.166 --> 58:05.035
Plus, we could use
a break from academia.

58:05.069 --> 58:08.072
And also, how often
do I get my V?

58:08.739 --> 58:10.007
Twice a year?

58:10.040 --> 58:11.442
- Maybe three times a year.
- I know, I know, I know.

58:11.475 --> 58:14.879
Okay, I need you all to
myself tonight. Okay?

58:14.912 --> 58:16.780
No filter. Full Dawn.

58:16.814 --> 58:17.982
Oh, she comes
with a filter?

58:20.451 --> 58:22.052
Also, after dinner...

58:24.221 --> 58:25.055
Yeah.

58:25.089 --> 58:27.858
You know, when we
leave dinner, it's on.

58:27.892 --> 58:30.461
We gonna be out in
these streets body rolling.

58:30.494 --> 58:31.695
- Oh, dinner. Tonight?
- Yes.

58:31.729 --> 58:34.832
I'm sorry, but I have a date
with my king bed tonight.

58:34.865 --> 58:36.066
I won't be joining.

58:36.834 --> 58:38.135
Whack. Wow.

58:38.169 --> 58:40.704
No. I have
a 6:00 a.m. flight.

58:40.738 --> 58:43.240
I promised Ken Ken I'd take
her to Katie's birthday party.

58:43.274 --> 58:45.843
Okay. All right.
It's fine.

58:45.876 --> 58:46.810
We will keep you abreast

58:46.844 --> 58:49.280
of all of our hoetivities
via text anyhow.

58:49.313 --> 58:51.749
Please do.
I wanna know everything.

58:51.782 --> 58:54.718
Girl, the hoetivity
is gonna be popping tonight.

58:54.752 --> 58:56.754
Girl, meet me down here
at 7:00 p.m.

58:56.787 --> 58:57.821
We'll Uber over, okay?

58:57.855 --> 59:00.891
Yes, 7:00 p.m.
And I have to go get dressed.

59:00.925 --> 59:02.159
Oh, speaking
of getting dressed,

59:02.193 --> 59:03.127
what are you
wearing tonight?

59:03.160 --> 59:05.362
Do not come down here
in mom jeans, okay?

59:05.396 --> 59:06.797
I need all eyes
on our table

59:06.830 --> 59:08.199
'cause I'm tryin'
to fuck tonight.

59:08.232 --> 59:10.467
You are on board
for that, okay?

59:10.501 --> 59:13.037
I won't disappoint.
Bye, girl.

59:25.149 --> 59:27.284
Well, hi. Don't you
look beautiful?

59:27.318 --> 59:29.186
Are you going
to the 49th floor, too?

59:30.120 --> 59:32.823
Shh.

59:32.856 --> 59:35.793
You'll get in trouble
for talking.

59:36.293 --> 59:37.228
I'll get...

59:37.261 --> 59:40.464
Oh. I'll get in trouble
for talking? Okay.

59:40.731 --> 59:41.932
Shh.

59:55.512 --> 59:57.448
Okay.

1:00:34.518 --> 1:00:36.387
You rang, darling?

1:00:39.857 --> 1:00:43.160
Girl, I said "Step it up,"
not murder these hoes.

1:00:43.193 --> 1:00:44.328
Mmm-mmm.

1:00:47.164 --> 1:00:48.432
Okay.
Here's a new concept.

1:00:48.465 --> 1:00:49.366
What do you think?

1:00:49.400 --> 1:00:52.870
Instead of a "fuckboy,"
it's an "inti-mate."

1:00:52.903 --> 1:00:54.872
Okay, I love
everything about it.

1:00:54.905 --> 1:00:56.307
It's someone who's
gonna feed me ice cream

1:00:56.340 --> 1:00:58.008
and knows how to soothe
my childhood trauma.

1:00:59.109 --> 1:01:00.944
It doesn't sound like
you need to take a Plan B

1:01:00.978 --> 1:01:02.046
with that guy at all.

1:01:02.079 --> 1:01:03.514
- An inti-mate...
- I just want somebody

1:01:03.547 --> 1:01:04.581
to snuggle me at night.

1:01:04.615 --> 1:01:06.517
- That's all I want.
- You deserve.

1:01:06.550 --> 1:01:08.285
- Is that so much to ask?
- You can call me.

1:01:08.319 --> 1:01:09.987
You're
a great snuggler.

1:01:10.020 --> 1:01:13.957
- I am a great snuggler.
- Oh, my God.

1:01:13.991 --> 1:01:16.093
What are you smiling at?
Who's that?

1:01:16.126 --> 1:01:18.162
Well,
you know it's Nick.

1:01:18.195 --> 1:01:20.397
Let's see.
Dick pics or no?

1:01:21.231 --> 1:01:22.366
Aw.

1:01:22.399 --> 1:01:23.434
Yeah.

1:01:23.467 --> 1:01:26.637
See, here I thought marital
bliss was an oxymoron.

1:01:26.671 --> 1:01:30.441
Guys, I can 100% confirm that
Nick is not that perfect.

1:01:30.474 --> 1:01:32.609
Trust, okay?

1:01:32.643 --> 1:01:34.978
- But he is kind of perfect for me.
- Yeah.

1:01:35.012 --> 1:01:36.347
- Ugh. Girl, she ruined it.
- There it is.

1:01:36.380 --> 1:01:38.582
I thought there
was tea coming.

1:01:38.615 --> 1:01:40.918
I miss my babies, okay?

1:01:40.951 --> 1:01:42.419
I'd miss him, too.

1:01:44.388 --> 1:01:46.290
"I miss my baby.

1:01:46.323 --> 1:01:47.991
- "Oh, he's so perfect for me."
- Please, guys.

1:01:48.025 --> 1:01:49.460
"He's so perfect for me.

1:01:49.493 --> 1:01:51.161
"He's my lobster.

1:01:51.195 --> 1:01:54.098
"He's the Chandler Bing
to my Monica."

1:01:54.131 --> 1:01:55.499
"He fits perfectly
in my little box."

1:01:58.102 --> 1:01:59.436
"Like a puzzle piece."

1:02:00.571 --> 1:02:02.606
Yeah, no, we're very happy

1:02:02.639 --> 1:02:04.341
for you, bitch.

1:02:06.210 --> 1:02:08.445
- All right. Time to live in the present.
- Okay, babe.

1:02:08.479 --> 1:02:09.480
- Yeah.
- Okay, okay.

1:02:11.683 --> 1:02:12.916
Damn.

1:02:14.284 --> 1:02:17.254
- Oh, my God. Okay.
- Shit, are you okay? Holy...

1:02:18.255 --> 1:02:21.091
<i>Hi.
Henley for three, please.</i>

1:02:21.125 --> 1:02:24.628
We have your table.
Follow me.

1:02:40.344 --> 1:02:42.513
- Enjoy your dinner.
- Uh-uh. No, no, no, no.

1:02:42.546 --> 1:02:44.381
Sorry, I think what my friend
is trying to say is that...

1:02:44.415 --> 1:02:45.949
Actually, babe,
I got it.

1:02:45.983 --> 1:02:48.318
This table is 100%
not acceptable,

1:02:48.352 --> 1:02:50.487
and I think that you know
that, don't you...

1:02:50.521 --> 1:02:52.322
...Becky? Mmm-hmm.

1:02:52.356 --> 1:02:54.525
Listen, I'm actually not gonna
go back and forth with you

1:02:54.558 --> 1:02:57.394
about exactly why this
table's unacceptable.

1:02:57.428 --> 1:02:59.430
You're gonna seat us
over there.

1:02:59.463 --> 1:03:00.564
Oh, um...

1:03:00.597 --> 1:03:02.499
Thank you
so much, Rebecca!

1:03:02.533 --> 1:03:04.669
You're doing great!

1:03:04.702 --> 1:03:08.673
Yo, get your sis.
The Caucasity!

1:03:11.475 --> 1:03:14.211
- No, this is good.
- Well, then you're welcome.

1:03:14.244 --> 1:03:15.446
- Welcome.
- Hi.

1:03:15.479 --> 1:03:17.214
- Wine list. Hi.
- Thank you.

1:03:17.247 --> 1:03:20.083
My name is Sam.
I'll be taking care of you this evening.

1:03:20.117 --> 1:03:22.619
- Will a fourth be joining you?
- No, just us.

1:03:22.654 --> 1:03:26.223
Very good. And may I start
you off with a cocktail?

1:03:26.256 --> 1:03:30.360
Actually, we will share
a bottle of champagne.

1:03:30.394 --> 1:03:33.597
How about a nice bottle
of prosecco?

1:03:33.630 --> 1:03:36.668
A bottle of Armand de Brignac,
please. Thank you.

1:03:39.169 --> 1:03:41.104
Okay,
but more to the point,

1:03:41.138 --> 1:03:43.440
do you have any apt
prospects for the night?

1:03:43.474 --> 1:03:44.608
Mmm.

1:03:44.641 --> 1:03:47.511
Booked and busy,
actually.

1:03:47.544 --> 1:03:50.013
Actually, okay,
so there's this, um...

1:03:50.047 --> 1:03:51.582
Ooh, I've been trying
to set up a meeting

1:03:51.615 --> 1:03:53.150
with this guy, Justin.

1:03:53.183 --> 1:03:56.487
Fine. Just like
a dark chocolate,

1:03:56.520 --> 1:03:58.555
like a 72% cacao, you know?

1:03:58.589 --> 1:04:00.390
Just...
Chef kiss.

1:04:00.424 --> 1:04:01.759
- Is he fine?
- Yes, he's fine.

1:04:01.793 --> 1:04:04.161
- Mmm.
- And he's got a friend.

1:04:04.194 --> 1:04:05.730
- For me, a friend?
- Yeah, for you.

1:04:05.763 --> 1:04:08.232
- Mmm. A friend?
- Mmm-hmm.

1:04:08.265 --> 1:04:10.133
I don't know. That sounds
sort of suspicious.

1:04:11.101 --> 1:04:12.704
Like, it can't be good.

1:04:12.737 --> 1:04:14.104
I feel like you're leading me
into the snake den with this.

1:04:14.137 --> 1:04:15.272
Girl,
I'm sure he's fine.

1:04:15.305 --> 1:04:16.674
- You're sure?
- Oh, my God.

1:04:16.708 --> 1:04:18.041
- You're sure he's fine?
- You haven't even met him?

1:04:18.075 --> 1:04:19.076
No, I haven't met him.

1:04:19.109 --> 1:04:21.311
Nope. This is exactly
what is not happening.

1:04:21.345 --> 1:04:22.479
- I am too grown for this.
- It's not...

1:04:22.513 --> 1:04:23.547
Okay, you're too grown.

1:04:23.580 --> 1:04:25.148
No, got it. I feel blocked.

1:04:25.182 --> 1:04:28.085
I do. And that's okay.
'Cause you're grown.

1:04:28.118 --> 1:04:30.120
That's cool. It'll just
be you and me tonight

1:04:30.153 --> 1:04:31.823
and I will meet up
with fine-ass Justin

1:04:31.856 --> 1:04:33.758
some other time.
And maybe his friend, too.

1:04:33.791 --> 1:04:35.526
Hey.

1:04:36.728 --> 1:04:39.096
Okay. Do not look.

1:04:40.097 --> 1:04:42.266
There is a guy at the bar...

1:04:42.299 --> 1:04:44.401
I said don't look.

1:04:44.434 --> 1:04:48.071
...that has been staring
at us the entire night,

1:04:48.105 --> 1:04:49.506
and it's creeping me out.

1:04:49.540 --> 1:04:51.809
Excuse me, ladies.
Before we order entrees,

1:04:51.843 --> 1:04:54.111
I wanted to let you know
that the gentleman at the bar

1:04:54.144 --> 1:04:56.113
sent this drink
specifically for you.

1:04:56.480 --> 1:04:57.648
Oh.

1:05:00.517 --> 1:05:03.453
Specifically for me.

1:05:03.487 --> 1:05:05.556
Oh, my God.
He's coming over here.

1:05:05.589 --> 1:05:07.491
And he's coming this way.

1:05:07.524 --> 1:05:08.760
Okay, all right.

1:05:08.793 --> 1:05:10.193
Pardon me, ladies.

1:05:11.796 --> 1:05:13.330
I've had my eye on you.

1:05:14.666 --> 1:05:16.199
I just had to come by
and tell you

1:05:16.233 --> 1:05:18.101
that I think
you're quite stunning.

1:05:21.572 --> 1:05:26.643
Oh, thank you. Oh, gosh,
I'm so flattered, thank you.

1:05:26.678 --> 1:05:30.380
You are extremely
handsome yourself.

1:05:30.414 --> 1:05:31.448
Thanks.

1:05:31.481 --> 1:05:33.685
However, um,

1:05:33.718 --> 1:05:36.520
I'd be remiss if I didn't
take the chance to sort of

1:05:36.553 --> 1:05:39.189
critique your game
just a little bit.

1:05:39.222 --> 1:05:40.591
I'm sure that you can tell,

1:05:40.624 --> 1:05:41.659
even from all the way
over there,

1:05:41.693 --> 1:05:44.829
that we're actually
drinking champagne tonight.

1:05:44.862 --> 1:05:47.631
I am a champagne lady,

1:05:47.665 --> 1:05:51.134
and we are champagne ladies.

1:05:51.168 --> 1:05:55.572
So, sending over
a vodka-cran, yeah,

1:05:55.606 --> 1:05:57.909
it just shows
lack of appreciation

1:05:57.942 --> 1:06:01.311
for our situation
tonight, so...

1:06:01.345 --> 1:06:02.512
Well, what you should
have done is

1:06:02.546 --> 1:06:04.381
you should have
asked our waiter,

1:06:04.414 --> 1:06:07.150
which, again,
champagne we're drinking,

1:06:07.184 --> 1:06:10.587
and sent over a second bottle
of it for all of us.

1:06:10.621 --> 1:06:15.225
And then, you make eye contact
with me from across the room.

1:06:15.893 --> 1:06:17.227
You eye-fuck me.

1:06:17.260 --> 1:06:18.528
Oh, my God.

1:06:18.562 --> 1:06:21.264
And I say
all that to say,

1:06:21.298 --> 1:06:24.334
Oop, here's my number.

1:06:24.368 --> 1:06:27.772
Because this can happen.

1:06:28.438 --> 1:06:29.640
Good night.

1:06:32.209 --> 1:06:33.243
Oh.

1:06:33.276 --> 1:06:34.611
Why did you
do him like that?

1:06:34.645 --> 1:06:37.481
You know why I did him
like that. He needed to know.

1:06:37.514 --> 1:06:39.416
Okay, I'm sorry,
but can we just take a second

1:06:39.449 --> 1:06:43.253
to acknowledge that that guy
was supernaturally fine.

1:06:43.286 --> 1:06:44.621
Yeah, he was really cute.

1:06:44.656 --> 1:06:46.356
So? I'm cute, too.

1:06:46.390 --> 1:06:47.424
That's true.

1:06:47.457 --> 1:06:48.525
- You are cute.
- Yeah.

1:06:48.558 --> 1:06:50.728
Hey, to being cute and classy.

1:06:50.762 --> 1:06:52.764
- Yes. To being cute.
- To being fine as fuck.

1:06:54.932 --> 1:06:57.601
Well,
I definitely look forward

1:06:57.634 --> 1:06:59.904
to catching up on this saga.

1:06:59.937 --> 1:07:02.339
On a group text,
in my bed.

1:07:02.372 --> 1:07:03.373
Very safe move.

1:07:03.407 --> 1:07:08.846
Wait. Although,
this hotel has been so off.

1:07:08.880 --> 1:07:11.548
The front desk.
They didn't clean my room.

1:07:11.581 --> 1:07:13.685
So, I'm not even holding my
breath for turndown service.

1:07:13.718 --> 1:07:14.752
It's probably a mess.

1:07:14.786 --> 1:07:16.688
Really?
That's so strange.

1:07:16.721 --> 1:07:18.756
My service has
been impeccable.

1:07:21.959 --> 1:07:24.662
I got the Uber, but I can't
believe we're splitting up.

1:07:24.696 --> 1:07:26.363
- I know. I'm so sorry.
- Oh, no, no, no.

1:07:26.396 --> 1:07:27.899
Before we split up,
we have to take a selfie.

1:07:27.932 --> 1:07:29.701
- Oh, yes.
- Let's get a picture.

1:07:29.734 --> 1:07:31.769
Because it did not happen
if it didn't happen...

1:07:31.803 --> 1:07:34.271
- You are right about that.
- ...in a selfie.

1:07:34.304 --> 1:07:35.840
Where's my lipstick?

1:07:35.873 --> 1:07:37.742
- Girl, you look fine.
- Your lips look fine.

1:07:37.775 --> 1:07:38.810
No, but I put it
in there.

1:07:38.843 --> 1:07:39.877
- I could've sworn.
- Come on, come on.

1:07:39.911 --> 1:07:42.279
- Okay.
- Get ready and...

1:07:44.448 --> 1:07:46.550
- All right, that's it.
- Tag me in that.

1:07:46.583 --> 1:07:47.652
One-take wonders.
Everything.

1:07:47.685 --> 1:07:48.720
I love y'all.

1:07:48.753 --> 1:07:50.353
Thank you so much.

1:07:50.387 --> 1:07:51.388
One moment.

1:07:52.289 --> 1:07:54.025
- Love you.
- I love you.

1:07:54.058 --> 1:07:55.093
I'm so proud of you.

1:07:55.126 --> 1:07:58.261
- I love you. Get home safely.
- I love you so much.

1:07:58.295 --> 1:08:00.031
All right.
I hate I have to go.

1:08:00.064 --> 1:08:01.398
I have to get home
to my baby, though.

1:08:01.431 --> 1:08:02.566
Say hi to the family.

1:08:02.599 --> 1:08:04.836
All right. Love y'all.
Watch her.

1:08:04.869 --> 1:08:06.369
- You watch yourself.
- All night.

1:08:06.403 --> 1:08:08.973
- Watch her.
- You're gonna be in trouble.

1:08:09.006 --> 1:08:10.607
- Bye.
- Bye.

1:08:10.640 --> 1:08:12.342
Goodbye.
Is this our car?

1:08:12.375 --> 1:08:16.914
This is us. Let's go.

1:08:18.783 --> 1:08:22.385
The Montgomery Hotel, please.
I think I put it in.

1:08:22.419 --> 1:08:25.589
And do you mind turning
that down just a bit?

1:08:25.622 --> 1:08:26.623
Thank you.

1:08:33.064 --> 1:08:36.801
First off, that we are
some 5-star ladies.

1:08:36.834 --> 1:08:37.935
Aren't we, sister?

1:08:37.969 --> 1:08:40.004
And I just wanted
to comment

1:08:40.037 --> 1:08:41.839
that you look like
a 5-star gentleman.

1:08:41.873 --> 1:08:42.907
- Don't touch him.
- Is that too much?

1:08:42.940 --> 1:08:43.975
- Don't touch him.
- I know.

1:08:44.008 --> 1:08:45.209
- I wanna have five stars.
- It's too much.

1:08:45.243 --> 1:08:48.345
I feel like that was too much.
I shouldn't... I'm sorry, Gus.

1:08:48.378 --> 1:08:49.613
I'm so sorry, Gary.

1:08:49.646 --> 1:08:51.281
Hey, put your...
Can you turn that up?

1:08:55.753 --> 1:08:58.522
- Hello?
- <i>Hello, Veronica?</i>

1:08:58.555 --> 1:09:00.323
Who is this?

1:09:00.357 --> 1:09:01.793
<i>♪ Blame it on my juice</i>

1:09:01.826 --> 1:09:02.860
<i>♪ Blame it, blame it
on my juice ♪</i>

1:09:02.894 --> 1:09:03.928
Come on, alto.

1:09:03.961 --> 1:09:04.996
<i>♪ Ya-ya eee ♪</i>

1:09:05.029 --> 1:09:06.063
Wait, hold on, yo, hold on.

1:09:06.097 --> 1:09:07.497
<i>♪ Ya-ya-hold, ya-ya-hold ♪</i>

1:09:07.531 --> 1:09:09.066
<i>This is Autumn,
your Uber driver.</i>

1:09:09.100 --> 1:09:10.802
- Oh, there must be...
- <i>I'm outside of Stefano's.</i>

1:09:10.835 --> 1:09:13.070
Yeah, there must be a mistake.
I'm in my car right now.

1:09:13.104 --> 1:09:14.705
<i>I'm outside the restaurant.</i>

1:09:14.739 --> 1:09:16.339
No, there's a mistake.
I'm here now.

1:09:16.373 --> 1:09:17.708
- <i>Okay, whatever.</i>
- Thank you.

1:09:17.742 --> 1:09:21.746
Ma'am, do you mind turning
down the music, please?

1:09:24.481 --> 1:09:25.716
Hello!

1:09:34.859 --> 1:09:37.795
Turns out, this
color does look nice on me.

1:09:44.568 --> 1:09:47.738
Help! Help!

1:10:50.600 --> 1:10:52.670
What do you want?
It's 3:00 a.m.

1:10:56.674 --> 1:10:58.876
The arrangements
are already being made.

1:11:00.811 --> 1:11:03.714
Now, look, the ballot box
will go our way.

1:11:03.748 --> 1:11:06.183
The court will follow
one way or another.

1:11:08.152 --> 1:11:10.453
It's under control.
Is there anything else?

1:11:15.059 --> 1:11:16.493
Oh, really?

1:11:18.963 --> 1:11:22.033
If I see her pathetic husband
on the news one more time

1:11:22.066 --> 1:11:24.101
parading around
that little girl...

1:11:25.770 --> 1:11:27.905
Mouthy darkies are a plague.

1:11:29.740 --> 1:11:31.075
I'll take care of it.

1:11:32.076 --> 1:11:34.111
I'll take care of it.

1:11:34.145 --> 1:11:37.580
I said I will fucking
take care of it.

1:12:06.077 --> 1:12:07.211
Eden?

1:12:16.187 --> 1:12:17.487
Eden?

1:12:33.938 --> 1:12:37.174
They will never take you
away from me.

1:13:43.941 --> 1:13:44.942
What'd I say?

1:13:49.246 --> 1:13:52.249
What the fuck did I say?

1:13:54.852 --> 1:13:57.354
I told her yesterday
she got one pass.

1:13:57.388 --> 1:13:58.322
Now she thinks
she can come down

1:13:58.355 --> 1:14:00.124
to the fields whenever
she goddamn pleases.

1:14:01.859 --> 1:14:04.395
Well, she will learn
her lesson today.

1:14:04.428 --> 1:14:06.797
Girl, go get her.

1:14:07.765 --> 1:14:09.100
I can head up there, sir.

1:14:11.268 --> 1:14:13.270
Who gave you permission
to speak, boy?

1:14:15.072 --> 1:14:17.675
I gave myself
permission to speak.

1:16:02.513 --> 1:16:03.781
Tonight.

1:16:07.318 --> 1:16:10.454
We go tonight.

1:20:46.396 --> 1:20:47.431
I'm here.

1:20:57.307 --> 1:20:58.575
No, no, no...

1:21:11.488 --> 1:21:13.223
- Are you ready?
- Let's go.

1:21:14.591 --> 1:21:16.326
Wait. Wait.

1:21:23.567 --> 1:21:25.469
Well, I'll be damned.

1:21:49.761 --> 1:21:51.094
You're killing me, man.

1:21:51.128 --> 1:21:52.129
Hey, dude,
what the hell?

1:21:58.302 --> 1:21:59.403
Hey, is this yours?

1:22:01.305 --> 1:22:02.306
No, Purcell,

1:22:02.339 --> 1:22:03.875
you know I know the rules,
man. No cell phones.

1:22:03.908 --> 1:22:07.144
- You fucking cuck.
- No cell... What?

1:22:07.177 --> 1:22:09.413
Don't say my fucking name out
here, Daniel!

1:22:09.914 --> 1:22:11.615
I'm sorry.

1:22:11.648 --> 1:22:13.483
I don't fucking want it.

1:22:13.517 --> 1:22:14.686
All right.

1:22:22.459 --> 1:22:25.128
You should
have seen your face.

1:22:33.838 --> 1:22:34.772
Yeah, I'm mad.

1:22:34.806 --> 1:22:36.340
I mean, she's talking
to me all the time.

1:22:36.373 --> 1:22:37.407
Well, no, you gotta

1:22:37.441 --> 1:22:38.542
stick up for yourself,
all right?

1:22:38.575 --> 1:22:39.610
- I know.
- You can't expect every...

1:22:39.643 --> 1:22:41.445
What was that?

1:22:41.478 --> 1:22:42.714
Well, it came
from that direction.

1:23:07.805 --> 1:23:09.640
Fuck!

1:23:09.674 --> 1:23:11.408
Man, you scared
the shit out of me.

1:23:11.441 --> 1:23:14.746
Oh, what is it?
The spooks got you spooked?

1:23:15.747 --> 1:23:16.781
It's nothing, man.

1:23:16.814 --> 1:23:19.449
There's no one
out here this late.

1:23:19.483 --> 1:23:22.586
Look at that moon,
though. Beautiful.

1:23:23.721 --> 1:23:27.157
Yeah. Well,
enjoy it, snowflake.

1:23:32.629 --> 1:23:34.264
Fine, you traitor.

1:23:34.297 --> 1:23:36.801
Yeah, yeah, write
about it in your diary, Romeo.

1:23:59.423 --> 1:24:01.959
I need to piss, man.
I'm gonna take a piss.

1:24:03.393 --> 1:24:05.697
Let me get these
fucking things off.

1:24:06.898 --> 1:24:07.799
Daniel.

1:24:07.832 --> 1:24:09.633
You're not supposed
to say my fucking...

1:24:13.570 --> 1:24:15.272
- Get the damn phone.
- Got it.

1:24:19.443 --> 1:24:20.477
Oh, shit.

1:24:20.510 --> 1:24:23.848
Listen,
if I don't make it,

1:24:24.782 --> 1:24:27.719
the world has to find out
about this place.

1:24:28.920 --> 1:24:31.354
It has to end tonight.

1:24:32.589 --> 1:24:34.659
I know there's service
at the cabin.

1:24:35.392 --> 1:24:36.794
Let's go.

1:24:48.873 --> 1:24:49.907
Come on.

1:24:52.309 --> 1:24:54.578
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

1:24:55.913 --> 1:24:57.547
<i>What's your emergency?</i>

1:24:58.482 --> 1:25:01.953
My name is Veronica Henley.

1:25:01.986 --> 1:25:05.656
I have been kidnapped.
There are so many of us here.

1:25:05.690 --> 1:25:06.791
We're on some
sort of plantation.

1:25:06.824 --> 1:25:07.624
<i>I'm sorry,
ma'am, you're breaking up.</i>

1:25:07.658 --> 1:25:09.426
I need you
to send help right now.

1:25:09.459 --> 1:25:10.494
<i>Did you say "plantation"?</i>

1:25:10.527 --> 1:25:12.529
Hello? Hello?

1:25:24.407 --> 1:25:27.712
We need his face
to unlock this phone.

1:25:28.746 --> 1:25:31.548
That's the only way
we can send our location.

1:25:39.090 --> 1:25:40.423
I got you.

1:27:31.669 --> 1:27:33.637
No fuckin' loyalty!

1:27:38.776 --> 1:27:40.111
Eden!

1:27:41.879 --> 1:27:45.016
My name is Veronica!

1:28:03.267 --> 1:28:05.069
Open your eyes, motherfucker.

1:28:06.671 --> 1:28:10.007
I said, open your
motherfuckin' eyes!

1:28:26.824 --> 1:28:27.825
<i>Hello?</i>

1:28:28.659 --> 1:28:29.794
Nick?

1:28:29.827 --> 1:28:32.930
<i>V? V!</i>

1:28:32.964 --> 1:28:34.932
I'm okay. I'm alive.

1:28:34.966 --> 1:28:38.501
<i>V, no. No, no, no.
Tell me exactly where you are.</i>

1:28:38.535 --> 1:28:40.537
I don't know,
but I'm getting out.

1:28:40.570 --> 1:28:43.573
<i>Oh, my God. Everyone has
been searching for you.</i>

1:28:43.606 --> 1:28:44.809
I can't talk right now.

1:28:44.842 --> 1:28:48.578
I need you to call the police, now.
I'm gonna send you a pin.

1:28:48.611 --> 1:28:50.281
- <i>Mommy!</i>
- Oh.

1:28:50.314 --> 1:28:52.116
- <i>Okay, okay, V. No.</i>
- Baby.

1:28:52.149 --> 1:28:53.918
- <i>No, stay with me.</i>
- I love...

1:28:53.951 --> 1:28:55.485
Hello?

1:29:05.663 --> 1:29:08.799
Come on. No. No, no, no.

1:29:35.592 --> 1:29:36.961
Professor.

1:29:39.030 --> 1:29:40.530
I'm sorry.

1:31:26.470 --> 1:31:28.305
This doesn't end here.

1:31:31.842 --> 1:31:33.210
We're nowhere

1:31:35.846 --> 1:31:37.414
and everywhere.

1:31:49.727 --> 1:31:51.061
What the fuck are you doin'
out of your cabin?

1:31:51.095 --> 1:31:52.263
It's the general, sir.
He's hurt.

1:31:52.296 --> 1:31:53.931
- Please come quick.
- Wait.

1:31:53.964 --> 1:31:55.833
- Come quick. He's hurt.
- God!

1:31:55.866 --> 1:31:57.735
Oh, God. Oh.

1:31:57.768 --> 1:31:59.870
Jesus Christ. Senator?

1:31:59.904 --> 1:32:01.739
Senator Denton! Sir?

1:32:03.774 --> 1:32:05.843
Eden! Hey! Eden?

1:32:07.077 --> 1:32:08.646
Eden, open this door!

1:32:09.046 --> 1:32:10.447
Shh.

1:32:11.949 --> 1:32:14.185
Please,
open the fuckin' door.

1:32:14.218 --> 1:32:17.288
Open the door.
Jesus fuckin'...

1:32:17.321 --> 1:32:19.256
Eden, open this
fuckin' door right now!

1:32:19.290 --> 1:32:20.824
Open the door!

1:32:20.858 --> 1:32:22.126
No, Veronica!

1:32:22.159 --> 1:32:23.394
Veronica, Veronica,
listen to me.

1:32:23.427 --> 1:32:26.397
Please. Veronica!

1:32:26.430 --> 1:32:27.765
What the fuck
is she doing?

1:32:27.798 --> 1:32:29.033
Open that
fuckin' door!

1:32:31.302 --> 1:32:33.003
No! Get it off!

1:33:00.231 --> 1:33:01.498
The hell is that?

1:33:01.532 --> 1:33:02.933
Go on, mount up!
Let's go!

1:33:08.239 --> 1:33:09.940
Get, girl! Get!

1:33:28.592 --> 1:33:30.160
Get, girl!

1:33:43.941 --> 1:33:45.276
Eden!

1:33:55.052 --> 1:33:56.086
Get, girl!

1:34:09.900 --> 1:34:11.035
Eden!

1:34:16.507 --> 1:34:17.875
Eden!

1:34:22.346 --> 1:34:24.415
You're not gonna
get out of here alive.

1:34:24.448 --> 1:34:26.517
Now, why can't you
just accept that?

1:34:26.550 --> 1:34:29.286
Accept what you are.

1:34:30.988 --> 1:34:32.489
You are nothin'.

1:34:34.958 --> 1:34:37.227
You ain't nothin',
but a cotton picker.

1:34:39.296 --> 1:34:41.398
You think you're
better than us,

1:34:44.101 --> 1:34:46.537
but you ain't better than me,
you fuckin' cunt!

1:34:49.206 --> 1:34:51.575
My father kept insistin'.

1:34:53.177 --> 1:34:55.479
He said you were
spreadin' such filth!

1:34:57.081 --> 1:34:58.949
I told him you weren't
worth the risk,

1:35:01.485 --> 1:35:03.887
but he couldn't resist.

1:35:03.921 --> 1:35:05.489
The movement be damned!

1:35:06.557 --> 1:35:08.225
He just had to have you.

1:35:08.258 --> 1:35:10.961
Every single one of you
I picked,

1:35:11.528 --> 1:35:13.230
except for you.

1:35:14.264 --> 1:35:16.066
His favorite girl.

1:35:19.269 --> 1:35:23.273
Now, of course, like always,

1:35:23.307 --> 1:35:26.276
it's up to a woman
to clean up the mess of a man.

1:35:28.078 --> 1:35:29.113
Eden?

1:35:33.250 --> 1:35:35.486
Get your black ass out here!

1:35:52.970 --> 1:35:54.706
Get the fuck up.

1:35:54.739 --> 1:35:57.274
Get the fuck up.

1:35:57.307 --> 1:35:58.409
Get the fuck up!

1:36:45.322 --> 1:36:49.193
What kind of woman are you?

1:37:11.749 --> 1:37:13.383
Get, girl, Get.

1:37:24.328 --> 1:37:26.330
Go, Daphne. Get, girl.
