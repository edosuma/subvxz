Come in. Anyone? Anybody out there?

00:04.971 --> 00:06.906
[Crying]

00:06.939 --> 00:08.774
We're sick.

00:08.808 --> 00:10.643
I'm broadcasting in the blind.

00:10.710 --> 00:11.877
Mama?

00:11.912 --> 00:13.846
- Mama?
- In the blind!

00:13.880 --> 00:15.848
- [Coughing]
- Mama, please don't fall asleep.

00:15.882 --> 00:18.050
Sam: Mama, we're
gonna get you help.

00:18.084 --> 00:19.518
- [Coughs]
- Wake up, mama, please!

00:19.553 --> 00:22.421
Jed: Anyone, please? Anyone out there?

00:22.455 --> 00:25.190
Anyone... damn it! [Coughing]

00:25.225 --> 00:28.494
Mama, please don't fall asleep!
Wake up, mama!

00:28.528 --> 00:30.663
[Echoes] Mama!

You sure you have enough
for the whole crew?

01:38.264 --> 01:39.898
And 50 or 60 more.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.300
When we get home,

01:41.368 --> 01:43.402
we can use this as a vaccine and a cure?

01:43.436 --> 01:46.939
The uninfected will be immunized, and...

01:46.973 --> 01:48.741
The sick can be cured,

01:48.775 --> 01:51.276
providing they're not too far gone.

01:51.311 --> 01:54.647
After all the failures
and the false starts,

01:54.714 --> 01:56.448
I just feel so...

01:56.483 --> 01:57.950
Happy?

01:58.018 --> 02:00.019
[Exhales sharply]

02:00.053 --> 02:02.488
I can't truly remember the last time

02:02.522 --> 02:04.156
that I felt that emotion.

02:04.224 --> 02:07.059
Still so much to do.
We have to mass produce it,

02:07.127 --> 02:09.261
we have to distribute it.

02:09.329 --> 02:12.131
- Thank God...
- Rachel...

02:12.165 --> 02:13.966
You did it.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.970
Let's enjoy the moment.

Sync & Corrections by Darcade
- Addic7ed.com -

02:50.403 --> 02:53.505
I told her how I feel.

02:53.573 --> 02:55.074
I mean... [exhales]

02:55.108 --> 02:58.210
Basically spilled my guts to her.

02:58.244 --> 03:01.480
I mean, sure, I'm spiking
a 104-degree fever,

03:01.514 --> 03:04.416
but still.

03:04.451 --> 03:07.186
"You make me wanna love again."

03:07.220 --> 03:09.888
I actually said that.

03:09.923 --> 03:13.358
And what does she give me? Zip.

03:13.393 --> 03:18.530
What I understand about women,
you fit in a shot glass.

03:18.598 --> 03:20.733
I don't need to tell you.

03:20.800 --> 03:23.068
[Whines]

03:23.103 --> 03:26.105
[Indistinct conversations]

03:29.309 --> 03:32.211
Hey, how are you feeling?

03:33.913 --> 03:36.014
I don't get seasick, so...

03:36.049 --> 03:37.716
[Exhales]

03:37.751 --> 03:40.652
I've never seen morning sickness
on a D.D.G. before.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.021
[Exhales] Have you seen a nursery?

03:43.056 --> 03:44.256
[Chuckles] No.

03:44.290 --> 03:47.226
- [Door opens]
- Form up.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.096
[Sighs]

03:51.164 --> 03:55.100
Okay, here's the deal.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.802
We are presently attempting to make contact

03:56.836 --> 03:59.838
with the infectious disease lab
at Fort Detrick,

03:59.873 --> 04:01.807
as it has just the facility
Dr. Scott requires

04:01.841 --> 04:04.743
for mass producing the cure.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.578
So far we've had no joy.

04:06.613 --> 04:08.714
I'll be honest...

04:08.748 --> 04:11.550
Knowing how deadly this plague
is and how fast it spreads,

04:11.618 --> 04:13.085
I don't have any confidence

04:13.119 --> 04:15.454
that there's gonna be any survivors, so...

04:15.488 --> 04:17.822
That being said,

04:17.857 --> 04:19.158
there's a reason they call it a fort.

04:19.192 --> 04:20.993
And if anyone can hold their own,

04:21.027 --> 04:23.562
it's our friends in the U.S. army.

04:23.596 --> 04:24.897
Master Chief.

04:24.964 --> 04:27.466
Thank you, sir.

04:27.534 --> 04:30.135
I want to address the issue
that's on all of our minds.

04:30.170 --> 04:31.737
On our way up the coast,

04:31.771 --> 04:34.573
our ship will be passing
right by Norfolk... by home.

04:35.942 --> 04:38.243
And our comms team tells us
we could pick up

04:38.311 --> 04:40.979
some orphan signals from random cell towers

04:41.047 --> 04:43.282
or servers still online.

04:43.316 --> 04:45.117
You may even get a phone call

04:45.151 --> 04:46.652
if they've restored power on land.

04:46.719 --> 04:50.656
It's unlikely, but I just
wanna prepare you.

04:50.690 --> 04:53.492
We don't know what to expect
when we get back to the states.

04:53.526 --> 04:54.993
The only way to help the people we love

04:55.028 --> 04:57.029
is to deliver Dr. Scott and the cure

04:57.063 --> 04:59.164
to a secure and workable lab.

04:59.199 --> 05:01.533
Detrick's our best bet,
so that's our mission.

05:01.568 --> 05:02.801
All: Aye, sir.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.803
Carry on.

05:30.663 --> 05:31.864
Any station in this net vicinity

05:31.898 --> 05:33.565
of Fort Detrick U.S.A.M.R.I.I.D.,

05:33.600 --> 05:35.534
this is U.S.S.<i> Nathan James,</i> over.

05:35.568 --> 05:37.236
Aye, sir.

05:37.270 --> 05:39.271
Captain, S.S.E.S. reports
that the keyhole satellite

05:39.305 --> 05:41.807
will be flying over
our whiskey in 50 seconds.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.809
Unable to steer,

05:43.843 --> 05:45.978
but they did manage to break
the uplink/downlink encryption.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.346
Bringing up the feed now.

05:47.413 --> 05:49.848
[Beeping]

05:49.883 --> 05:52.651
- [Exhales deeply] It's traveling fast.
- Too fast, sir.

05:52.719 --> 05:54.453
There's no one left at home to control it.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.355
When it gets over the area,

05:56.389 --> 05:57.689
we'll have less than a minute
to capture the images we can.

05:57.724 --> 05:59.524
We just need enough to chart a clear route

05:59.559 --> 06:01.526
from the land to the lab.

06:01.561 --> 06:03.795
We've tapped into one of
the air force's spy satellites

06:03.863 --> 06:06.398
to check the traffic to Fort Detrick.

06:06.432 --> 06:08.901
Well, why not send
your helicopter or drone?

06:08.968 --> 06:10.435
No more fuel.

06:10.470 --> 06:12.504
They spent it all looking for me.

06:12.538 --> 06:15.073
Kara: Satellite passing over us.

06:15.108 --> 06:19.311
[Static]

06:19.379 --> 06:20.913
Mason: Any station...

06:20.947 --> 06:25.117
Come on, give us something.

06:25.151 --> 06:27.185
There it is.

06:27.253 --> 06:30.589
[Beeps]

06:30.623 --> 06:32.357
Home.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.059
That's interstate 70.

06:34.093 --> 06:35.894
If it's clear, it'll get us
all the way to detrick.

06:35.929 --> 06:39.131
There'll be some image blur,
but I'll get you closer, sir.

06:39.165 --> 06:40.866
[Clicks]

06:40.900 --> 06:44.369
That's a mass evacuation.

06:44.437 --> 06:46.505
- Take us north a mile.
- Aye, sir.

06:46.539 --> 06:49.074
[Typing]

06:49.108 --> 06:51.810
Any station this net vicinity of
Fort Detrick U.S.A.M.R.I.I.D.,

06:51.844 --> 06:53.378
this is U.S.S.<i> Nathan James...</i>

06:53.413 --> 06:56.782
That red "X"... Some sort of quarantine?

06:56.849 --> 06:59.284
More like a warning sign to stay away.

06:59.319 --> 07:01.820
Looks like people took it seriously.

07:01.854 --> 07:05.090
Sir, the satellite's approaching
Fort Detrick.

07:05.124 --> 07:06.625
I say again,

07:06.659 --> 07:08.927
anyone at Fort Detrick, please respond.

07:08.962 --> 07:11.430
The laboratory building's
in the center of campus.

07:11.497 --> 07:13.532
Roger that, ma'am. Zooming in.

07:17.770 --> 07:20.072
[Whispers] Oh, my God.

07:20.106 --> 07:23.108
[Normal voice] It's been
completely destroyed.

07:23.176 --> 07:27.446
The lab, the containment areas,
the equipment, everything.

07:27.480 --> 07:28.981
Nothing else on the base was burned.

07:29.048 --> 07:31.283
That lab was targeted.

07:31.317 --> 07:34.419
Who would've done that?

07:42.962 --> 07:45.897
Slow down! Slow down!

07:45.932 --> 07:47.366
Stop the car.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.167
Where you goin'?

07:49.202 --> 07:51.770
My family's sick. They need help.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.171
Can't go this way. Turn around.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.273
Please. Please, we're just trying...

07:55.308 --> 07:57.943
- Trying to get to Olympia.
- Olympia can't help you.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.845
Go back where you came from, old man.

08:05.818 --> 08:08.987
[Window whirs]

08:17.563 --> 08:18.997
Get down.

08:21.567 --> 08:23.168
- [Shifts gear]
- [Gasps]

08:23.202 --> 08:25.037
[Engine revs, tires screech]

08:25.071 --> 08:27.539
- [Children scream]
- [Gunshots]

08:27.573 --> 08:30.509
[Machine gunfire in distance]

08:30.543 --> 08:32.711
[Engine revs, tires screech]

08:32.745 --> 08:35.514
[Man shouts indistinctly]

08:35.581 --> 08:37.149
Should we go after 'em?

08:38.717 --> 08:41.820
No. They'll be dead soon.

08:46.908 --> 08:49.676
Sir! Sir!

08:49.710 --> 08:51.478
Take a breath. What is it?

08:51.512 --> 08:53.680
I caught a new broadcast.
It's another loop.

08:53.714 --> 08:55.615
But this one was updated today.

08:55.683 --> 08:57.951
And there's something you need to hear.

08:57.985 --> 08:59.953
Woman: <i> Winds are coming out</i>
<i>of the southwest,</i>

08:59.987 --> 09:02.122
<i>and temperatures will reach
50 degrees in Baltimore...</i>

09:02.156 --> 09:04.124
How come we're just hearing this now?

09:04.158 --> 09:05.625
Probably a weak F.M. transmitter, sir.

09:05.660 --> 09:07.494
It must've just come into range.

09:07.562 --> 09:08.929
<i>There are reports of a fresh
outbreak of the red flu</i>

09:08.963 --> 09:10.564
- <i>in sector 9.</i>
- "Red flu."

09:10.598 --> 09:12.032
Is that what they're calling it?

09:12.066 --> 09:13.500
Doesn't do it justice somehow.

09:13.534 --> 09:15.468
It's looping around. Here it comes.

09:15.503 --> 09:17.504
<i>U.S.S.</i> Nathan James,
<i>we are aware of your mission</i>

09:17.538 --> 09:20.006

<i>If you are within range of this signal,</i>

<i>please reply on V.H.F. channel 1-6.</i>

09:30.251 --> 09:32.853
- Get them on the line.
- Yes, sir.

09:32.887 --> 09:34.688
This is U.S. naval warship <i>Nathan James</i>

09:34.722 --> 09:39.025

We have heard your call, over.

09:39.060 --> 09:42.095
This is U.S. naval warship <i>Nathan James</i>

hailing you on channel 1-6.
We have heard your call, over.

09:45.299 --> 09:47.112
Baltimore. We should set a
course in that direction.

09:47.136 --> 09:48.168
Agreed.

09:49.737 --> 09:52.038
- [Door closes]
- We may still be too far out.

09:52.073 --> 09:54.040
You let me know as soon as you find out.

09:54.075 --> 09:55.909
Good work, son.

09:57.545 --> 09:59.579

- <i>Schools have reopened in sector 3,</i>

- Jed?

10:20.601 --> 10:23.803
Did you hear that, Darien?
Tom's still out there.

10:23.838 --> 10:28.275
People are waiting for him.
Don't worry, sweetheart.

10:28.342 --> 10:31.378
You're gonna make it. You hang in there.

10:32.780 --> 10:34.781
[Keys jangle]

10:34.815 --> 10:38.885
[Engine sputters, turns over]

10:38.953 --> 10:40.520
- Quincy: I had to do what was best...
- [Door opens]

10:40.588 --> 10:43.023
- Kelly: Best for whom?
- Please listen to that.

10:43.057 --> 10:44.925
Rachel: Ava?

10:44.992 --> 10:49.095
Kelly: We have been through it.

10:49.130 --> 10:51.431
They're at it again.

10:51.465 --> 10:53.066
Quincy: You know that I love you.

10:53.100 --> 10:56.603
Events... they just happen
on a mind of their own...

10:56.637 --> 11:00.106
I know that things are better now.

11:00.174 --> 11:02.275
But...

11:02.343 --> 11:05.679
I don't think they'll be the same again.

11:10.985 --> 11:12.652
Hello, Kelly.

11:12.687 --> 11:15.689
Hi. Ava, darling, shall we go
and find something to eat?

11:15.723 --> 11:17.557
All right.

11:21.128 --> 11:22.395
I'll see you later.

11:22.463 --> 11:24.965
I'll see you later. Bye.

11:31.706 --> 11:35.108
She can't forgive me
for what I put them through.

11:38.412 --> 11:40.981
To be honest, I don't blame her.

11:42.383 --> 11:43.750
Well, when the Captain
finds the right place

11:43.784 --> 11:47.754
for us to put ashore,

11:47.788 --> 11:50.490
maybe you can all start again

11:50.524 --> 11:53.193
on more solid ground.

11:57.031 --> 11:58.765
Captain, I've got Baltimore.

11:58.833 --> 12:00.533
A Mrs. Granderson is on the line.

12:00.568 --> 12:01.801
Did you say Granderson?

12:01.836 --> 12:03.970
- Yes, sir.
- Well, put her through.

12:04.005 --> 12:05.305
They're trying to use the vidcom,

12:05.339 --> 12:07.140
but so far it can only get audio, sir.

12:07.174 --> 12:09.142
- Go ahead, sir.
- This is Tom Chandler,

12:09.176 --> 12:12.178
commanding officer of
the U.S.S.<i> Nathan James,</i> over.

12:12.213 --> 12:14.014
<i>Captain Chandler.</i>

12:14.048 --> 12:17.684
<i>You have no idea how good it is
to hear your voice.</i>

12:17.718 --> 12:19.919
<i>We thought you were lost at sea.</i>

12:19.954 --> 12:22.322
No, ma'am, we're alive and well.

12:22.356 --> 12:24.557
- <i>Oh! There you are.</i>
- I got it.

12:24.625 --> 12:27.927
<i>You must be nearby. I'm Amy Granderson.</i>

12:27.962 --> 12:32.165
<i>And I suppose an explanation is in order.</i>

12:32.199 --> 12:33.600
<i>As vice-chair of</i>

12:33.634 --> 12:36.336
<i>the President's defense policy board,</i>

12:36.370 --> 12:39.072
<i>I was briefed on your
mission to the Arctic.</i>

12:39.106 --> 12:42.575
<i>I knew the risks of the coming pandemic,</i>

12:42.610 --> 12:47.881
<i>and I had my daughter
transferred to your ship.</i>

12:47.915 --> 12:50.016
<i>You must forgive me.</i>

12:50.051 --> 12:51.918
No apology needed, ma'am.

12:51.952 --> 12:53.853
Your daughter's been an incredible asset.

12:53.888 --> 12:56.356
Pleased to hear from you.

12:56.424 --> 12:58.725
We had no word
from the presidential bunker.

12:58.793 --> 13:02.729
<i>President Geller invited me underground.</i>

13:02.763 --> 13:05.732
<i>I declined. I-I felt the risk was too big</i>

13:05.766 --> 13:08.168
<i>to have so much of our civilian
and military command</i>

13:08.202 --> 13:13.706
<i>in one confined space.
Unfortunately, I was right.</i>

13:13.774 --> 13:15.809
So the government is gone.

13:15.843 --> 13:17.510
<i>For the most part, yes.</i>

13:17.545 --> 13:19.679
<i>Since the bunker went silent,</i>

13:19.713 --> 13:22.282
<i>there has been a breakdown
of infrastructure,</i>

13:22.316 --> 13:27.754
<i>general panic, and, of course,
a tremendous loss of life.</i>

13:27.788 --> 13:31.424
<i>I have tried to execute a contingency plan</i>

13:31.459 --> 13:33.460
<i>working with the state and local police</i>

13:33.527 --> 13:36.029
<i>to create safe zones.</i>

13:36.097 --> 13:39.232
<i>We have been hanging on as best we can.</i>

13:39.266 --> 13:44.037
<i>And I have been praying
every day for your return.</i>

13:47.108 --> 13:51.077
Ma'am, we can be in Baltimore
in the matter of hours.

13:51.112 --> 13:52.812
In the meantime,

13:52.847 --> 13:56.483
I'm sure there is someone
you'd like to speak with.

14:02.289 --> 14:03.957
Mom?

14:03.991 --> 14:05.558
<i>Alisha!</i>

14:05.593 --> 14:08.094
Mom, I don't... I don't understand...

14:08.129 --> 14:10.296
What are you doing? Where are you?

14:10.331 --> 14:15.368
<i>I'm here, darling.
Oh, I knew you were out there.</i>

14:15.402 --> 14:17.770
<i>I just knew it.</i>

14:23.910 --> 14:25.544
- Thorwald.
- [Water splashing]

14:25.578 --> 14:29.181
We've intercepted a transmission.

14:29.215 --> 14:31.350
A U.S. Navy ship is due to make
port in a matter of hours

14:31.384 --> 14:33.419
in Baltimore harbor.

14:33.453 --> 14:36.321
- What kind of ship?
- I don't know, sir.

14:36.356 --> 14:39.058
Well, is it a tug? A destroyer?

14:39.092 --> 14:41.560
A 5,000-sailor aircraft carrier?

14:41.594 --> 14:44.396
The signal was spotty.
All we know is the name.

14:44.431 --> 14:46.031
<i>Nathan James.</i>

14:46.066 --> 14:49.268
It's the ship
they've been hailing for weeks.

14:49.302 --> 14:51.203
Granderson's sending out a greeting party.

14:52.639 --> 14:55.574
Well, if they're having a party...

14:55.642 --> 14:58.243
Then let's party.

14:58.278 --> 14:59.611
Man: We are cleared, Baltimore.
[Speaks indistinctly]

14:59.679 --> 15:02.681
The port distance 1,000 yards.

15:02.715 --> 15:05.384
No threats, no contact.
Man: All commands reporting...

15:05.418 --> 15:07.753
Man: V.B.S.S. on the way
to designated meeting point.

15:07.787 --> 15:10.189
Kara: E.W. reports negative
rackets of interest.

15:10.256 --> 15:13.058
Nothing moving on surface plot.
Clean picture.

15:13.093 --> 15:14.760
Bridge? C.I.C.

15:14.828 --> 15:16.728
A.T.T.W.O. reports S.C.A.T.
team manned and ready

15:16.763 --> 15:21.266
at all crew-served weapon
stations port and starboard.

15:22.802 --> 15:24.470
Jeter: All right, let's move.

15:24.537 --> 15:26.738
- Fan out.
- Aye, sir.

15:26.773 --> 15:30.075
Secure a perimeter.
Dennis and Rowler, left flank.

15:30.110 --> 15:32.044
Cruz, you take right.

15:33.546 --> 15:35.914
Keep your hands on the swivel, fellas.

15:35.949 --> 15:38.851
[Man speaks indistinctly]

15:40.353 --> 15:41.987
Man: Perimeter secure.

15:42.021 --> 15:43.789
Man: Keep eyes on upper structures.

15:43.823 --> 15:45.757
Copy.

15:49.863 --> 15:51.697
Slattery: Here they come.

15:59.806 --> 16:02.741
[Men speaking indistinctly]

16:06.846 --> 16:08.614
Hi! Hey.

16:08.648 --> 16:11.016
I'm Lieutenant Pete Norris
of the Maryland state police.

16:11.050 --> 16:13.552
Inside my vehicles are
my assistant barrack commander,

16:13.586 --> 16:15.354
my criminal section supervisor,

16:15.388 --> 16:18.090
and a few surviving state troopers.

16:21.194 --> 16:24.363
You don't need the masks. We're not sick.

16:24.397 --> 16:27.065
I'm Lieutenant Green,
this is Lieutenant Burk.

16:41.114 --> 16:43.882
It's a pleasure to make your
acquaintance, Lieutenant.

16:43.917 --> 16:46.351
Bridge, Burk. The pier is secure.

16:46.419 --> 16:47.786
- All clear, over.
- [Radio static]

16:47.820 --> 16:49.521
Understand. All clear on the beach.

16:49.556 --> 16:50.856
- Landing party underway.
- [Radio chirps]

16:53.359 --> 16:55.794
- Welcome to Baltimore. [Laughs]
- Hey, it's great to be here.

16:55.828 --> 16:58.163
Looks like the troopers just got themselves

16:58.198 --> 17:00.032
a couple hundred U.S. sailors.

17:00.066 --> 17:02.701
A few dozen tomahawks, too.

17:08.441 --> 17:10.375
Looks like a landing party arriving.

17:13.112 --> 17:20.685
Thorwald: Including the Captain.

17:20.720 --> 17:22.621
You must be Lieutenant Norris.

17:22.655 --> 17:24.623
Tom Chandler, C.O., <i>Nathan James.</i>

17:24.656 --> 17:27.392
Pleasure to meet you.
This is Lieutenant Landau.

17:27.426 --> 17:28.894
Ma'am. Sir.

17:28.928 --> 17:31.330
Hey. How y'all doin'?

17:31.397 --> 17:33.432
Just fine, now that you're here.

17:33.466 --> 17:35.601
We can escort you guys back to our H.Q.

17:39.739 --> 17:41.139
Thorwald: Here comes another van.

17:41.174 --> 17:43.275
Man: <i> Cobra 1 in place.</i>

17:43.309 --> 17:45.577
<i>All clear on the beach.</i>

17:54.621 --> 17:56.688
[Engine turns off, doors close]

17:59.759 --> 18:01.560
Holy shit.

18:01.594 --> 18:02.828
What?

18:02.862 --> 18:04.129
- [Voice breaking]
- Mom?

18:04.163 --> 18:06.331
I had to come see for myself.

18:06.366 --> 18:08.533
Oh, my baby girl.

18:08.568 --> 18:10.769
It's her. It's Granderson.

18:12.872 --> 18:14.906
She came out herself.

18:16.442 --> 18:19.144
I am so glad to have you back.

18:19.178 --> 18:21.913
Captain Chandler, thank you.

18:21.948 --> 18:24.082
Thank you for returning my daughter to me.

18:24.117 --> 18:26.251
Privilege, ma'am.
We wouldn't be here without her.

18:26.286 --> 18:27.919
Take the shot.

18:29.555 --> 18:30.989
Mrs. Granderson,

18:31.024 --> 18:32.457
we really need to get you
back in the vehicle.

18:34.727 --> 18:36.762
She's blocked.

18:38.197 --> 18:39.865
Come. Everyone's eager to meet you.

18:42.969 --> 18:44.870
I can take out the fat man.

18:44.904 --> 18:47.739
No! You only have one shot.

18:47.807 --> 18:49.675
- I want her.
- <i>Danny: Nathan James,</i>

18:49.709 --> 18:51.109
<i>looks like we're having
a bit of a family reunion here.</i>

18:51.144 --> 18:52.844
We're headed out with the group.

18:52.912 --> 18:54.780
<i>Sending Lieutenant Norris back
with the V.B.S.S.</i>

18:54.814 --> 18:57.015
<i>To update you on the situation
on the ground, sir.</i>

18:57.050 --> 18:58.784
Roger that.

18:58.818 --> 19:00.852
We'll arrange a welcome
for Lieutenant Norris.

19:00.887 --> 19:03.789
Oh, and say "hi" to Mom for us.

19:03.823 --> 19:05.891
Damn it!

19:05.925 --> 19:07.559
I lost her.

19:15.835 --> 19:17.669
Talk to your friends on the inside.

19:17.704 --> 19:19.771
Find out what they're doing here.

19:21.107 --> 19:22.341
[Click]

19:56.149 --> 19:57.984
- Man: Let's go!
- [Dog barking in distance]

20:31.752 --> 20:33.019
[Doors close]

20:38.392 --> 20:41.227
We were fortunate to find this building.

20:41.261 --> 20:43.162
There's only one coal-fired
plant still operational,

20:43.230 --> 20:45.598
and we have a direct line.

20:45.632 --> 20:47.800
Plus, strategically we're
far enough from the city

20:47.834 --> 20:49.435
to avoid infection.

20:49.469 --> 20:52.238
You'll be safe here.

20:52.272 --> 20:54.040
Come.

21:06.086 --> 21:07.787
Mom, this is amazing.

21:07.821 --> 21:09.455
Oh, yes, but it's been a battle.

21:09.489 --> 21:10.723
And who's the enemy?

21:10.757 --> 21:12.958
Warlords, they call themselves.

21:13.026 --> 21:14.360
And recently, they've killed

21:14.394 --> 21:16.729
more people than the actual virus.

21:16.763 --> 21:20.166
Do you know they raided
the National Archives?

21:20.200 --> 21:21.667
They actually tried to steal

21:21.702 --> 21:24.003
original copies of the Constitution.

21:25.706 --> 21:30.476
As if that could take away
who we are as a people.

21:30.510 --> 21:32.078
Captain.

21:34.314 --> 21:36.148
I didn't want to broadcast about the virus

21:36.183 --> 21:38.684
over an open radio feed, but...

21:38.719 --> 21:41.120
The President told me
that you had the materials

21:41.188 --> 21:42.888
to produce a vaccine.

21:42.923 --> 21:45.257
Is that true?

21:45.292 --> 21:46.892
Yes, ma'am.

21:46.927 --> 21:49.495
We've actually made a little
more progress than that,

21:49.529 --> 21:50.796
Mrs. Granderson.

21:50.864 --> 21:52.965
[Inhales sharply]

21:52.999 --> 21:55.000
We have the cure.

22:00.640 --> 22:03.642
Fort Detrick was our first option, too.

22:03.677 --> 22:05.478
They had the lab and all, but, uh,

22:05.512 --> 22:08.614
- Thorwald got there first.
- Thorwald.

22:08.648 --> 22:11.517
Former Baltimore P.D. turned
self-proclaimed leader

22:11.551 --> 22:13.252
of the Warlords.

22:13.286 --> 22:16.122
Been a real pain in our ass
since this whole thing started.

22:16.156 --> 22:19.692
I shouldn't complain. [Chuckles]

22:19.760 --> 22:21.994
I imagine you've been through
a hell of a time yourselves.

22:22.028 --> 22:26.132
Listen, Lieutenant,
last I talked to my wife,

22:26.166 --> 22:28.334
she said was taking
the family to Deer Park.

22:28.368 --> 22:29.702
Safe zone. Heard of it.

22:29.736 --> 22:31.937
You know if it's still there?

22:32.005 --> 22:35.307
There was fighting,
but there are survivors.

22:37.511 --> 22:40.146
I can get you there as soon
as we get you off the ship.

22:40.213 --> 22:42.882
- [Click, hiss]
- Ooh! Thanks, Doc.

22:42.949 --> 22:44.850
You have no idea how good that felt.

22:44.885 --> 22:46.485
Well, I have some idea.

22:46.520 --> 22:47.820
- Yeah.
- [Click]

22:49.589 --> 22:50.856
Man: What were the results of the test...

22:50.891 --> 22:53.292
[Speaks indistinctly]

22:53.326 --> 22:55.094
See, these results are consistent...

22:55.128 --> 22:58.731
Now this is the main reason
we chose this building.

22:58.765 --> 23:02.001
[Speaking indistinctly]

23:02.035 --> 23:06.939
We've worked for months
trying to develop a cure.

23:06.973 --> 23:09.041
But now you're here.

23:09.109 --> 23:11.544
[Exhales] It's heavenly.

23:21.721 --> 23:23.422
[Clapping]

23:51.518 --> 23:54.820
- [Door opens]
- You're not gonna like this, boss.

23:54.855 --> 23:59.391
My guy inside Granderson's said
the ship came back with a cure.

23:59.426 --> 24:01.727
It could be bullshit.
We've heard this before.

24:01.761 --> 24:03.462
Not from the U.S. Navy.

24:03.497 --> 24:05.264
If that's true, Granderson will spread out,

24:05.298 --> 24:08.234
go anywhere she wants.
We will lose the city.

24:08.268 --> 24:10.636
We need to get our hands on the cure.

24:10.704 --> 24:12.905
It's probably locked away
somewhere on the ship.

24:14.207 --> 24:16.408
The only way is to take
Granderson on directly.

24:16.443 --> 24:18.444
We have to take her lab.

24:22.315 --> 24:24.984
Rachel: Extraordinary.

24:27.153 --> 24:29.288
- Look at her.
- [Speaks indistinctly]

24:29.356 --> 24:31.223
She's in love with a toaster.

24:31.258 --> 24:32.925
You still haven't made your move yet?

24:32.993 --> 24:34.693
Oh, I've been making my move since Gitmo.

24:34.728 --> 24:36.662
She ain't buying what I'm selling.

24:36.696 --> 24:38.230
I thought once she saved the world,

24:38.298 --> 24:40.199
- she'd let loose a little.
- [Chuckles]

24:40.233 --> 24:42.001
Jeter: <i> Nathan James,</i> this is
Vulture One. Do you copy?

24:42.035 --> 24:44.203
[Lowered voice] This is her letting loose.

24:44.237 --> 24:46.205
I repeat... <i> Nathan James,</i>
this is Vulture One.

24:46.239 --> 24:48.073
Do you copy? I can't get through, sir.

24:48.108 --> 24:49.808
You won't get a signal here, Master Chief.

24:49.843 --> 24:51.510
The Warlords are jamming
the local frequencies.

24:51.545 --> 24:52.978
They have a radio room, sir.

24:53.013 --> 24:55.714
I let the X.O. know where we are.

24:55.749 --> 24:58.150
Ma'am, uh, if that radio room
is still available,

24:58.218 --> 24:59.818
I'd like to get word to my family,

24:59.886 --> 25:01.387
see if they're still out there.

25:01.421 --> 25:03.722
I think it's time you thought of yourself.

25:03.757 --> 25:05.791
Meanwhile, we can work with your team

25:05.825 --> 25:09.361
to arrange safe transit here
for your ship's crew.

25:11.097 --> 25:12.831
- Due to warlord activity...
- This is Tom Chandler,

25:12.866 --> 25:14.366
listening on a spread spectrum,

25:14.401 --> 25:16.502
looking for Jed Chandler
in Clearwater, Virginia,

25:16.536 --> 25:18.337
- or parts nearby, over.
- Citizens are advised

25:18.371 --> 25:20.606
to avoid these areas until further notice.

25:20.640 --> 25:23.342
This is Tom Chandler, listening
on a spread spectrum,

- What do you mean?

29:24.631 --> 29:26.398
Olympia's off-limits. It's for sick people.

You'll inform the others then?

Very good.

I want to try and look for Sarah.

30:44.644 --> 30:46.645
I-if you survived, there's a chance

30:46.679 --> 30:47.980
that maybe she's still okay.

30:48.014 --> 30:50.182
Alisha...

30:50.250 --> 30:52.684
Your friend lived in Wisconsin.

[Pouring coffee]

30:56.856 --> 30:58.357
- Soon, maybe.
- But if we make...

30:58.391 --> 31:00.158
Soon.

31:00.193 --> 31:02.728
Now...

31:02.762 --> 31:04.730
Tell me this...

31:04.764 --> 31:07.666
What kind of man is Captain Chandler?

31:07.700 --> 31:10.135
He's amazing.

31:10.203 --> 31:12.971
Without him, we wouldn't have
gotten through any of this.

31:13.006 --> 31:15.774
So he hasn't the let
the power go to his head?

31:15.842 --> 31:19.077
I'm not sure I understand the question.

31:20.613 --> 31:24.249
I'm asking if he will still follow orders.

31:24.284 --> 31:26.184
Follow orders from whom?

31:29.022 --> 31:30.889
Mother, what's going on?

31:40.845 --> 31:44.247
Michael, have you seen these protocols?

31:44.281 --> 31:46.649
Of course. Why?

31:46.683 --> 31:48.718
Well, Dr. Hamada claims that his treatment

31:48.785 --> 31:51.287
prolongs the lives of the infected.

31:51.355 --> 31:53.456
But his whole assumption about the virus

31:53.490 --> 31:55.057
seems to be wrong.

31:55.092 --> 31:56.826
[Huffs] I'm just a statistician,

31:56.860 --> 31:58.227
but the data he's given me suggests

31:58.295 --> 31:59.829
- the treatment's working.
- No, that's impossible.

31:59.863 --> 32:02.398
- Is something wrong?
- Dr. Hamada,

32:02.432 --> 32:04.200
you're using ribavirin to introduce

32:04.234 --> 32:06.235
higher error rates to
the virus' D.N.A. replication.

32:06.269 --> 32:07.837
In a chemical cocktail, yes.

32:07.871 --> 32:09.672
Yes, but the pandemic virus is error-free.

32:09.706 --> 32:12.041
Your treatment wouldn't have
any positive effect whatsoever.

32:12.075 --> 32:15.578
In fact, these dose levels
are highly toxic.

32:15.645 --> 32:17.013

I understand you have some questions

In the 14th century, the Black Death

were wiped out.

from our point of view.

37:11.408 --> 37:14.043

who would use this crisis

37:14.077 --> 37:17.313
to take what does not belong to them.

37:17.347 --> 37:20.316
They are the barbarians at the gate

37:20.383 --> 37:23.352
who would send us into a new dark age.

37:23.386 --> 37:26.221

37:32.896 --> 37:35.531
the people whose survival will ensure

37:35.565 --> 37:38.300
the future of our entire society...

37:40.537 --> 37:43.272
And all that we hold dear.

37:43.306 --> 37:45.708
So you gather your elite few

37:45.775 --> 37:47.309
within these walls.

37:47.344 --> 37:49.378
And the rest...

37:49.446 --> 37:51.347
What happens to them?

37:51.381 --> 37:55.718
The virus doesn't discriminate.

37:55.752 --> 38:01.256
That unfortunate task falls to me.

38:03.059 --> 38:06.095
<i>[Indistinct chatter over P.A.]</i>

38:09.766 --> 38:13.001
[Man coughs in distance]

38:15.438 --> 38:16.672
[Clicks]

38:24.914 --> 38:27.282
Pl... [Breathing erratically]

38:27.317 --> 38:29.551
Plea... plea...

38:29.586 --> 38:30.819
Please...

38:32.889 --> 38:34.690
[Whimpering]

38:34.758 --> 38:38.127
[Gasping]

38:41.197 --> 38:43.899
Hey, what are you doing? You can't be here!

38:43.933 --> 38:45.234
You're killing them.

38:45.268 --> 38:46.869
Get the hell back behind the curtain!

38:48.505 --> 38:50.939
- You're killing them!
- Stay back!

38:50.974 --> 38:52.741
- You sick bastards!
- Man: Hey, you can't be here!

38:52.776 --> 38:55.277
[Gunfire]

38:55.311 --> 38:57.679
Captain, we gotta move!

38:57.714 --> 38:59.615
Man: Security breach in section 12.

38:59.649 --> 39:02.951
Repeat... security breach in section 12.

39:21.004 --> 39:23.972
[Truck engine revving]

39:30.980 --> 39:33.315
I don't... I don't... I don't get it.

39:33.349 --> 39:35.384
They're burning 'em.

39:38.655 --> 39:42.157
They're burning the bodies
to power the city.

39:47.831 --> 39:50.499
- [Clicks]
- I know it's hard to understand.

39:50.533 --> 39:52.501
You've been away so long.

39:52.535 --> 39:58.507
But in time, Rachel,
you'll see it's the only way.

40:03.112 --> 40:04.880
She was trying to run.

40:04.914 --> 40:06.982
Dr. Scott, I swear I had
no idea this was happening.

40:07.016 --> 40:08.750
- I swear...
- Hush, dear.

40:08.785 --> 40:10.786
You can't replicate my work

40:10.820 --> 40:12.688
with the doses that I've given you.

40:14.624 --> 40:17.526
Everything that you need
is locked up on that ship.

40:17.560 --> 40:20.863
And the Captain will never give it up.

40:21.998 --> 40:25.400
You let me worry about the Captain.

40:28.872 --> 40:30.405
Daddy...

40:32.242 --> 40:33.842
We have to go.

40:37.780 --> 40:41.517
- [Radio static]
- <i>Nathan James,</i> come in. Do you read me?

40:41.551 --> 40:43.852
[Radio static crackling]

40:43.887 --> 40:46.788
<i>Nathan James,</i> come in. Do you read me?

40:46.823 --> 40:48.090
<i>Nathan James,</i> this is the Captain.

40:48.124 --> 40:49.491
Come in. Do you read me?

41:18.421 --> 41:21.456
[Whirring]

41:25.595 --> 41:28.096
Chandler: Nathan James, <i>come in.
Do you read me?</i>

41:30.266 --> 41:31.466
Nathan James, <i>this is the Captain.</i>

41:31.534 --> 41:33.101
<i>Come in. Do you read me?</i>

41:33.169 --> 41:36.204
<i>Nathan James,</i> where are you?
