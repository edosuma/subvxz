WEBVTT

00:01.887 --> 00:05.355
Where I come from, some people had an idea
about what I was supposed to be.

00:05.423 --> 00:08.757
- That's over with now.
- I think you need taking care of.

00:10.592 --> 00:12.826
You wanna branch out,
that's Jake with me.

00:12.894 --> 00:15.795
But what I don't need
is a fuckin' headache.

00:15.862 --> 00:17.229
Nobody cares about
some colored kid.

00:17.296 --> 00:19.563
Chalky cares,
so that means I care.

00:19.631 --> 00:21.964
And you can bet your ass come
election day you're gonna care too.

00:22.032 --> 00:24.466
- He drives a Packard you said.
- But it wasn't chalky.

00:24.533 --> 00:25.966
You hung a fella
that works for him.

00:26.034 --> 00:27.434
He got the message, didn't he?

00:27.501 --> 00:29.101
Then why is he still
operational?

00:29.169 --> 00:32.537
Maybe you didn't hear.
Johnny Torrio... he runs things now

00:32.604 --> 00:34.237
and he's taking over
your territory.

00:34.305 --> 00:36.372
Tell Torrio he gets
what he wants.

00:36.439 --> 00:39.674
You will deliver to miss
Danziger this dress.

00:39.741 --> 00:41.374
I'll see you
to the dressing room.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.775
I hope you're not offended
by all the drinking.

00:43.843 --> 00:46.611
- Old habits die hard.
- If they die at all.

00:46.678 --> 00:48.612
Well, that's a very
practical perspective.

00:48.680 --> 00:50.647
I'm a very practical woman.

00:50.715 --> 00:52.614
Let me look at you.

02:50.114 --> 02:51.548
Two more.

02:51.582 --> 02:54.551
What do you say, Charlie?
Give me a hand, huh?

02:59.257 --> 03:01.692
All right, roll it down.
You got it?

03:01.727 --> 03:03.995
Whoa, easy now.

03:05.597 --> 03:07.899
I got it, I got it.

03:08.901 --> 03:11.036
Roll it down.

03:12.238 --> 03:14.772
All right.
Keep it going.

03:56.518 --> 03:58.085
As far as I'm concerned,
they can take

03:58.120 --> 04:00.788
St. Patrick's day
and sell it for scrap.

04:00.823 --> 04:02.924
Dad says it's 'cause
you hate being Irish.

04:02.958 --> 04:04.425
I love being Irish.

04:04.460 --> 04:06.894
What I hate is the yearly
display of crying, arguing

04:06.929 --> 04:08.730
and public drunkenness
that goes with it.

04:08.764 --> 04:11.733
Centuries of loss.
We're a sorrowful people.

04:11.767 --> 04:13.968
Maybe it'll snow.

04:15.638 --> 04:19.208
Good morning, Mr. Thompson.

04:19.242 --> 04:21.411
Good morning to you.

04:21.445 --> 04:23.413
Would you care to order
some breakfast?

04:23.447 --> 04:25.581
No, Martin.
Thank you.

04:29.185 --> 04:31.318
Who am I, the forgotten man?

04:33.351 --> 04:34.982
I beg your pardon, sir.

04:35.016 --> 04:38.115
- Would you like something?
- No.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.713
How come they ask you about breakfast
and I gotta raise a stink?

04:43.747 --> 04:45.480
I live here.
It's a courtesy.

04:45.515 --> 04:47.682
- You gotta live here to get served?
- I'm a big tipper, Eli.

04:47.717 --> 04:51.153
- Okay? - You act like it
doesn't mean anything.

04:51.187 --> 04:53.289
Because it doesn't.

04:55.392 --> 04:58.761
The Celtic dinner...
we're moving it up to 7:00.

04:58.795 --> 05:01.730
- Why so early?
- The civil war vets.

05:01.765 --> 05:04.399
One of them snored over the Attorney
General's speech last year.

05:04.434 --> 05:06.067
You don't gotta be old
for that to happen.

05:06.102 --> 05:07.536
You think you can do better?

05:07.570 --> 05:09.938
Actually, I was thinking
about saying a few words.

05:09.972 --> 05:12.741
- What for?
- Some electioneering.

05:12.775 --> 05:14.443
Those reformers are looking
to replace me.

05:14.477 --> 05:15.977
I dot think a speech
is a good idea.

05:16.012 --> 05:18.213
It's a captive audience of the
biggest pooh-bahs in the county.

05:18.247 --> 05:19.747
Who are there to celebrate
their heritage,

05:19.782 --> 05:21.249
not be bored
by your palavering.

05:21.283 --> 05:24.719
I've been practicing,
taking lessons at the Y.M.C.A.

05:30.592 --> 05:31.926
It's an important night, Eli.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.694
Bad enough I have dad
to look after.

05:33.729 --> 05:35.630
I don't need you upsetting
the apple cart too.

05:35.664 --> 05:37.131
I want to say my piece.

05:37.166 --> 05:39.800
Fine.

05:39.835 --> 05:41.602
Daniel fucking Webster.

05:48.210 --> 05:50.178
The widow Schroeder.

05:52.214 --> 05:53.814
The widow Schroeder.

05:53.849 --> 05:56.784
Mr. Thompson,
good morning.

05:56.818 --> 06:00.455
I was just on my way
to your office.

06:00.489 --> 06:02.123
Some soda bread.

06:02.157 --> 06:04.292
I thought you might enjoy it.

06:04.326 --> 06:06.127
It's from an old family recipe.

06:06.162 --> 06:07.596
You can leave it
with the bellhop.

06:07.630 --> 06:08.964
He'll see that I get it.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.268
I'm sure for your birthday
you received many fine gifts...

06:13.302 --> 06:14.969
I'm late for a meeting,
Mrs. Schroeder.

06:15.003 --> 06:16.970
But thank you.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.499
Not a bad-looking woman.

06:23.534 --> 06:25.801
My life's complicated enough.

06:39.016 --> 06:42.086
Jesus, did they even wash
these things from last year?

06:42.120 --> 06:44.488
I was baby new year in '17.

06:44.522 --> 06:46.056
Even the diaper was secondhand.

06:46.090 --> 06:48.358
- There's blood on this.
- Captain haddock's.

06:48.392 --> 06:51.127
Some wiseacre tossed him
off the boardwalk.

06:51.162 --> 06:53.863
He landed face first
on an ashcan.

06:53.898 --> 06:55.765
Fuck this.

06:55.799 --> 06:58.000
No more leprechauns,
no more cupids,

06:58.035 --> 07:00.302
no more goddamn elf costumes.

07:00.337 --> 07:03.505
Kiley, green, you're up.

07:05.441 --> 07:07.542
- What's with you?
- I'm done, Carl.

07:07.576 --> 07:10.544
We all are.
No more midget shit.

07:10.578 --> 07:12.880
Midget shit's what
they're paying us for.

07:12.914 --> 07:14.715
Not boxing.
That's a show at least.

07:14.749 --> 07:16.450
We're talking about
this nonsense.

07:16.484 --> 07:19.819
This fucking Celtic dinner...
it's degrading.

07:19.854 --> 07:21.821
Yeah, not to mention
having those drunk assholes

07:21.855 --> 07:23.322
put their filthy mitts
all over you.

07:23.356 --> 07:25.424
What am I supposed
to tell Nucky?

07:25.458 --> 07:27.359
- He's depending on us.
- Yeah?

07:27.393 --> 07:29.093
Let him wear
a leprechaun getup.

07:30.862 --> 07:33.030
- Fuck him!
- Yeah.

07:35.900 --> 07:38.201
What if I can get us a raise?

07:40.804 --> 07:43.806
- How much?
- Double.

07:43.840 --> 07:46.141
I'll tell him we want
10 bucks a man.

07:48.277 --> 07:49.877
I might do it for 10.

07:50.979 --> 07:54.482
10 clams for a few hours' work?

07:54.516 --> 07:56.884
Where's me fuckin' shillelagh?

08:05.059 --> 08:08.895
Making a mess of this.

08:08.929 --> 08:12.198
That's okay.
I like the smell.

08:12.232 --> 08:14.066
Oranges in the winter, huh?

08:14.100 --> 08:18.369
- From California.
- Long trip.

08:18.403 --> 08:23.573
A couple nights in a sleeper
car and then you're there,

08:23.608 --> 08:26.142
wading up to your waist
in the ocean.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.450
I love you.

08:33.121 --> 08:35.226
What was that?

08:36.530 --> 08:38.133
Someone shut a door.

08:38.167 --> 08:41.943
I'm not gonna
let anyone hurt you, pearl.

08:44.415 --> 08:48.785
- Doc says you're doing good.
- Does he?

08:48.819 --> 08:50.820
But you gotta leave it alone.

08:50.855 --> 08:54.858
- It itches! - That's good.
It means it's healing.

08:54.892 --> 08:57.193
Did your leg itch
in the hospital?

08:57.228 --> 09:01.565
- For a while.
- But not anymore?

09:01.599 --> 09:05.002
No. Now it's hitting
all six.

09:06.771 --> 09:09.940
You're so handsome
in your new suit.

09:12.576 --> 09:15.279
Everything's gonna
turn out fine.

09:15.313 --> 09:17.014
You'll see.

09:17.048 --> 09:20.416
How about that?
As fresh as it gets.

09:21.485 --> 09:23.986
Any more laudanum?

09:26.489 --> 09:29.825
- What happened here?
- Poof.

09:39.769 --> 09:43.538
- Don't be stingy.
- It's opium, not a milkshake.

09:57.518 --> 10:01.087
It's like the sun
just came out.

10:12.832 --> 10:15.301
Come on, George, it's the
busiest day of the year.

10:15.335 --> 10:18.041
Eh, St. paddy's or no,
with prohibition

10:18.075 --> 10:19.546
we're in uncharted territory.

10:19.581 --> 10:22.293
So it's dead reckoning then.

10:22.327 --> 10:24.094
To the Irish.

10:24.129 --> 10:25.997
They drink when they're happy.

10:26.031 --> 10:27.465
They drink when they're sad.

10:27.499 --> 10:30.100
I drink to forget,
but I can't remember what.

10:30.134 --> 10:31.568
Well, it ain't just the micks.

10:31.602 --> 10:35.005
My entire ward... the speaks are
packing 'em in every night.

10:35.039 --> 10:37.975
- Everybody wants what they ain't
allowed to have. - Psychology.

10:38.009 --> 10:40.276
Whatever it is, they can't
keep the booze on the shelves.

10:40.311 --> 10:42.011
Hidden under
the shelves, you mean.

10:42.046 --> 10:44.047
- I'm gonna need to up my order.
- You hearing this, Captain?

10:44.082 --> 10:45.649
- I'm gonna need an extra boat.
- Deal me in.

10:45.683 --> 10:47.317
When do you shove off?

10:47.352 --> 10:50.354
The stroke of midnight
on the sea of green.

10:50.388 --> 10:51.855
That from money or beer?

10:51.890 --> 10:54.291
- How we fixed on that anyway?
- Green beer?

10:54.326 --> 10:56.027
Food coloring came today.

10:56.061 --> 10:57.561
They're dyeing it as we speak.

10:57.596 --> 10:59.263
Make sure
that dinner's supplied.

10:59.298 --> 11:01.298
Gonna need those poor
Celts well lubricated

11:01.333 --> 11:03.400
so they can get through
Eli's re-election speech.

11:03.435 --> 11:04.969
- What speech?
- Didn't you hear?

11:05.003 --> 11:06.504
He's Daniel Webster now.

11:06.538 --> 11:08.939
- Yeah, you made that joke already.
- It's true.

11:08.974 --> 11:11.275
He's taking
Dale Carnegie lessons.

11:11.309 --> 11:14.011
- To the great orator.
- Go on, give us a sample.

11:14.046 --> 11:16.280
Fuck you. There's your sample.

11:16.315 --> 11:18.416
Ah, the Irish...
they're a surly lot.

11:18.450 --> 11:20.985
- Well, give him a drink.
- Some green beer.

11:21.019 --> 11:23.087
Yeah well, in a couple of days

11:23.121 --> 11:25.022
the town's gonna be
swimming in it.

11:25.056 --> 11:28.059
They can drown for all I
care, so long as they pay.

11:28.093 --> 11:31.895
And pay they will, Nucky,
through their pug Irish noses.

11:31.930 --> 11:37.668
♪ Oh, Nucky boy,
the cash is coming ♪

11:37.702 --> 11:42.372
♪ right from their hands
into your bank account. ♪

11:44.509 --> 11:47.244
None of us was
so naive as to believe

11:47.278 --> 11:50.881
that prohibition
would end all drinking.

11:50.915 --> 11:54.318
Mrs. Schroeder, how nice
to see you again.

11:54.352 --> 11:56.653
I was beginning
to think you were ill.

11:56.688 --> 12:00.491
No. Thank you for your concern.
I've been working.

12:00.525 --> 12:03.795
- Who's looking after your children?
- A neighbor woman.

12:06.232 --> 12:09.634
I've asked Betty Anne
Mulhaney to share with us

12:09.668 --> 12:12.869
an incident related
to her by a relative.

12:12.904 --> 12:14.938
Mrs. Mulhaney?

12:14.973 --> 12:20.410
I received a letter from my
cousin Martha in Nebraska.

12:20.445 --> 12:23.213
One of her neighbors,
the widow of a dairyarmer,

12:23.248 --> 12:26.850
had fallen on hard times.

12:29.087 --> 12:30.854
Um, ahem.

12:30.888 --> 12:34.691
"With six children to feed,
temptation got the better of her,

12:34.725 --> 12:37.927
so she decided to mix up
some gin in her bathtub

12:37.962 --> 12:41.064
using a formula she'd gotten
from a farmhand,

12:41.098 --> 12:44.167
the idea being they'd sell it
in town for a profit."

12:44.201 --> 12:47.303
The devil's elixir.

12:47.338 --> 12:48.938
Um, ahem.

12:48.973 --> 12:53.343
"She mixed some water with juniper
berries and denatured alcohol,

12:53.377 --> 12:56.579
let the mixture set while
she went off to fix supper.

12:56.614 --> 12:59.482
As she did, her little one
got into the alcohol,

12:59.516 --> 13:01.150
poisoned herself dead."

13:01.184 --> 13:05.287
Right here it's the same thing...
illegal stills everywhere.

13:05.321 --> 13:07.056
I passed by Ettinger's.

13:07.090 --> 13:09.892
All those men at the counter
drinking from coffee cups...

13:09.926 --> 13:11.961
well, you know as well as I
it's not coffee at all.

13:11.995 --> 13:14.796
- Ettinger's isn't the only place.
- There's Abe Klein's too.

13:14.831 --> 13:17.032
It's clear
the local authorities

13:17.067 --> 13:21.237
lack the ability or the
inclination to enforce the law.

13:21.272 --> 13:23.373
And with our numbers dwindling,

13:23.407 --> 13:27.443
we have to work even harder
to capture their attention.

13:27.478 --> 13:30.179
I heard doc Holland is writing
prescriptions for whiskey.

13:30.213 --> 13:31.647
You don't even have to be ill.

13:31.681 --> 13:33.182
It's a disgrace is what it is.

13:33.216 --> 13:35.617
Ladies, please,
with all this clatter

13:35.652 --> 13:37.953
I'm not hearing
what we might do about it.

13:37.988 --> 13:39.288
A rally at the parade.

13:39.322 --> 13:40.923
Get out there marching
like the old days.

13:40.957 --> 13:42.992
Marching is all well and good,

13:43.026 --> 13:46.895
but we need to stop
the alcohol at its source.

13:46.930 --> 13:51.400
This morning I saw barrels
of beer, dozens of them,

13:51.434 --> 13:53.902
being loaded into a garage
behind my home.

13:53.937 --> 13:56.004
This is what I'm talking about.

13:58.808 --> 14:02.077
Perhaps Mr. Thompson
could be of help.

14:02.112 --> 14:03.779
The sheriff?

14:03.813 --> 14:06.615
His brother,
actually... Enoch.

14:06.649 --> 14:10.819
He's a friend.

14:10.854 --> 14:14.657
Which is to say he's been
of great assistance

14:14.691 --> 14:16.826
since my husband passed.

14:16.860 --> 14:21.096
Well, perhaps you could
arrange a meeting.

14:21.131 --> 14:24.233
I'd be happy to try.

14:26.402 --> 14:28.504
"Professional baseball
has reached a crisis.

14:30.907 --> 14:32.574
Charges of crookedness

14:32.609 --> 14:35.110
relating to last year's
world series are emerging

14:35.144 --> 14:38.547
with a well-known New York
gambler at its center."

14:38.581 --> 14:41.149
It doesn't mention you
by name, does it?

14:41.184 --> 14:43.585
It does everything but.

14:52.628 --> 14:59.200
Speculation, innuendo, and, if I
remember my law school Latin,

14:59.234 --> 15:01.202
a steaming pile of horseshit.

15:01.236 --> 15:04.372
Is that the legal term?

15:04.406 --> 15:07.341
You had a meeting with
some washed-up ex-boxer.

15:07.376 --> 15:09.477
- So what?
- Abe Attell.

15:09.512 --> 15:12.013
Followed by
a very public dinner

15:12.048 --> 15:15.316
with sleepy bill burns
at the Astor hotel.

15:15.351 --> 15:17.385
Is it a crime now
for a fella to eat dinner?

15:17.419 --> 15:19.420
The dinner was innocent,
counselor.

15:19.455 --> 15:22.790
But for dessert he pitched me
on fixing the world series

15:22.825 --> 15:24.893
by bribing the players
on the White Sox.

15:24.927 --> 15:28.096
A scheme which you threw
cold water upon immediately.

15:29.765 --> 15:32.967
Isn't that correct,
Mr. Rothstein?

15:33.002 --> 15:35.570
It certainly is.

15:35.604 --> 15:38.106
Then there you have it.

15:38.140 --> 15:40.441
And what do I do
about this article?

15:40.475 --> 15:42.242
You do nothing, Arnold.

15:42.276 --> 15:46.212
You get mud on your trousers...
or horseshit.

15:46.246 --> 15:50.216
Or horseshit...
you don't rub it off.

15:50.250 --> 15:53.819
You let it dry.
You let it set a while.

15:53.854 --> 15:56.623
Then you brush it off
nice and easy.

16:01.227 --> 16:04.062
The world series was
months ago, lawyer Fallon,

16:04.096 --> 16:07.532
and the horseshit
hasn't dried yet.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.651
- Why are you hovering?
- Carl Heeley wants a word.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.620
Who?

16:30.323 --> 16:31.556
What does he want?

16:33.125 --> 16:35.160
Just a quick tête à tête.

16:43.670 --> 16:44.537
How's your dad?

16:44.571 --> 16:46.105
Will he be at the dinner this year?

16:46.139 --> 16:48.641
- Can we just skip to the "by the way"?
- Beg pardon?

16:48.675 --> 16:51.176
Every day people come in
here, Carl... dozens of them.

16:51.210 --> 16:54.445
They ask after my health, my
family, my goddamn goldfish.

16:54.479 --> 16:56.080
Inevitably
there's a "by the way."

16:56.114 --> 16:57.515
Then they tell me
what they really want.

16:57.549 --> 16:59.483
- Well, that's not what I...
- Carl, I'm busy.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.185
You'd be doing me a huge favor.

17:01.219 --> 17:04.521
Me and the boys want a raise
to work the Celtic dinner.

17:04.556 --> 17:05.723
Absolutely not.

17:05.757 --> 17:08.625
Nucky, $5 a man
is just not enough

17:08.660 --> 17:10.627
for enduring that kind
of humiliation.

17:10.662 --> 17:13.130
Dancing a jig in a leprechaun outfit?
You call that humiliating?

17:13.164 --> 17:15.999
- What do you call it?
- Show business.

17:16.032 --> 17:18.734
You don't mind beating the tar out of
each other every night in that ring.

17:18.769 --> 17:20.737
But these drunks
are twice our size.

17:20.771 --> 17:23.507
They get really rough
and they think it's funny.

17:23.540 --> 17:26.108
Well, how much do you want?

17:26.144 --> 17:27.644
$10 a man.

17:27.678 --> 17:29.747
What's that,
three bucks a foot?

17:29.781 --> 17:31.582
It'll be a lot easier
this year.

17:31.616 --> 17:33.284
With prohibition, there'll be no booze.

17:33.318 --> 17:36.287
Come on, Nucky.
I only look like a child.

17:40.326 --> 17:43.794
Suppose I figure out a way to
give you an extra 12 bucks

17:43.829 --> 17:45.462
and I get to save 12 myself.

17:45.497 --> 17:47.831
- I'm listening.
- There are eight leprechauns, right?

17:47.866 --> 17:49.466
Eight times 10 is 80.

17:49.501 --> 17:51.401
Tell your boys the best
you can do was seven.

17:51.436 --> 17:54.071
Then it'll cost me 56.
I give you an extra 12.

17:54.105 --> 17:56.207
That leaves me paying 68,
which is 12 less

17:56.241 --> 17:57.908
than the 80
you originally wanted.

17:57.943 --> 18:00.244
- I don't know, Nucky.
- Dinner starts at 7:00.

18:00.278 --> 18:03.280
Tell your men to be dressed
and ready by 6:30.

18:07.319 --> 18:09.487
I have another meeting waiting.

18:15.060 --> 18:17.528
Hello, ladies.

18:17.563 --> 18:20.565
Mr. Thompson, thank you
so much for seeing us.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.401
Not at all.

18:23.836 --> 18:27.040
- Did you enjoy the soda bread?
- Pardon?

18:27.074 --> 18:29.875
Oh! Yes, very much.
Thank you.

18:32.179 --> 18:34.814
May I offer you something?

18:34.849 --> 18:37.217
Thank you, no.

18:38.552 --> 18:41.153
Mrs. Schroeder
has seen something

18:41.188 --> 18:43.956
she feels compelled
to tell you about.

18:43.990 --> 18:46.358
Oh?

18:46.392 --> 18:50.194
Yesterday morning an entire
truckload of beer barrels

18:50.229 --> 18:53.497
was loaded into a garage
behind my home.

18:53.531 --> 18:58.801
A man who looked familiar...
but I couldn't really place him...

18:58.836 --> 19:02.071
was supervising the delivery.

19:02.105 --> 19:03.572
Why, that's outrageous.

19:03.607 --> 19:06.275
I saw it with my own eyes.

19:06.309 --> 19:10.846
- I'm sure you must have been appalled.
- I was, quite.

19:12.615 --> 19:14.349
I'm afraid my birthday party

19:14.384 --> 19:16.818
must have been
quite difficult for you...

19:16.853 --> 19:19.354
at Babette's, the nightclub.

19:19.389 --> 19:22.023
I was making a delivery
for the dress shop.

19:22.058 --> 19:24.225
It was quite
a celebratory atmosphere.

19:24.260 --> 19:26.828
Some champagne and whiskey
may have even been drunk.

19:26.862 --> 19:30.599
I'm sure your class of acquaintance
drinks only in moderation.

19:30.633 --> 19:32.734
If they drink at all.

19:32.768 --> 19:36.104
Mrs. Schroeder, thank you for
sharing this information.

19:36.139 --> 19:37.939
Eddie, get the sheriff
on the phone.

19:37.973 --> 19:40.009
You give the details
to my brother

19:40.043 --> 19:43.079
and we'll shut down that garage
before the tide goes out.

19:43.113 --> 19:48.017
Mr. Thompson, we are
grateful as always.

19:48.985 --> 19:50.719
I truly do appreciate it.

19:50.754 --> 19:53.689
This isn't a personal favor,
Mrs. Schroeder.

19:55.358 --> 19:58.460
Yes, I realize that.

20:07.504 --> 20:09.638
- Mm-mm.
- Come on, eat a little.

20:09.673 --> 20:11.574
- Mm!
- You can't live on laudanum.

20:11.608 --> 20:14.943
Watch me.

20:24.955 --> 20:27.357
- Hey, Johnny.
- Hey, hon.

20:27.391 --> 20:29.258
How you feeling?

20:29.293 --> 20:31.461
Swell.

20:41.104 --> 20:44.739
Jesus Christ!
She's fuckin' ruined.

20:44.774 --> 20:47.442
Come on, it's not that bad.

20:47.476 --> 20:49.912
If she was a filly,
they'd shoot her.

20:51.114 --> 20:55.318
I know you took a shine
to her, but she gotta go.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.688
She hasn't even had
her stitches out.

20:58.722 --> 21:02.158
This is a cathouse,
not the hotel Sherman.

21:02.192 --> 21:04.794
She don't earn, I don't earn.

21:07.264 --> 21:11.067
- What if cover it?
- 100 a day?

21:11.101 --> 21:14.236
- She makes that much?
- She did.

21:17.507 --> 21:19.808
She got till Friday.

21:37.859 --> 21:40.227
So what did he want?

21:41.263 --> 21:43.431
Nothing.

21:43.465 --> 21:45.566
Scalcione's out sick.

21:45.601 --> 21:47.902
He wants me to work the door.

21:58.680 --> 22:00.848
I'll take the soup now.

22:00.882 --> 22:03.784
Come
on, bring it back, bring it back.

22:03.819 --> 22:05.786
A little more, a little more.

22:05.820 --> 22:07.621
All right, good.
Stop stop!

22:07.655 --> 22:09.790
Go ahead.

22:09.824 --> 22:12.192
Whoa whoa, easy!
It's gonna fall on me.

22:12.227 --> 22:14.127
I got it, I got it.

22:14.161 --> 22:16.963
All right, let's start unloading.
Come on, guys.

22:16.997 --> 22:19.698
- All right, one at a time.
- All right, coming down, coming down.

22:19.733 --> 22:22.234
Come on, don't get
ahead of yourselves.

22:22.268 --> 22:25.469
Good good.
Ma'am.

22:26.571 --> 22:28.339
What are you doing?

22:28.373 --> 22:30.074
We're unloading this truck.

22:30.108 --> 22:31.575
Unloading it?

22:31.610 --> 22:36.113
We gotta tint it green by
tomorrow for St. paddy's.

22:36.147 --> 22:38.882
Who is in charge here?

22:38.917 --> 22:40.517
Boss?

22:44.389 --> 22:46.491
Well.

22:47.560 --> 22:50.863
- Mrs. Schroeder, right?
- Mr. Neary.

22:52.132 --> 22:54.266
Like a soft night
in Wicklow, isn't it?

22:54.300 --> 22:56.368
I couldn't say.
I'm from Kerry.

22:56.402 --> 23:00.005
Ah, the lofty peak
of carrauntoohil.

23:02.008 --> 23:04.276
Did Mr. Thompson
not speak with you today?

23:04.310 --> 23:06.778
- About what?
- Your business here.

23:06.813 --> 23:08.680
We'll be out of your hair
by tomorrow.

23:08.715 --> 23:11.617
Most of this stuff
is for the Celtic dinner.

23:11.651 --> 23:14.353
Listen, fellas,
you've gotta keep it down.

23:14.387 --> 23:16.889
People are trying
to sleep here.

23:18.291 --> 23:21.293
What say we pour you off
a growler for St. Paddy's, hmm?

23:21.327 --> 23:23.495

24:32.799 --> 24:35.000
He knows I've been waiting.

25:24.747 --> 25:28.082
90 Baltic:
11 cases gin.

25:32.187 --> 25:36.323
- Mrs. Schroeder.
- Good afternoon.

25:36.357 --> 25:39.727
- I'm intruding.
- You are not.

25:39.761 --> 25:42.563
This is my colleague
Agent Sebso.

25:42.597 --> 25:46.133
- Margaret Schroeder.
- Ma'am.

25:47.502 --> 25:49.503
Eh.

25:54.075 --> 25:56.743
Is the post office
in charge of prohibition?

25:56.777 --> 25:59.245
No, ma'am.

26:03.284 --> 26:07.453
You said I should come to
you if I had information.

26:09.924 --> 26:11.891
Roll down your sleeves.
Put on your jacket.

26:11.925 --> 26:13.392
Bring Mrs. Schroeder
a chair.

26:13.427 --> 26:15.428
Go outside and block
the entrance.

26:50.063 --> 26:53.132
On the street behind
my home is a garage.

26:53.166 --> 26:55.067
Yes?

26:55.102 --> 26:57.337
It's full of beer barrels.

26:58.872 --> 27:00.340
How many?

27:00.374 --> 27:02.842
Quite a large quantity.

27:02.877 --> 27:05.378
Could you give me an estimate?

27:05.412 --> 27:09.115
93?

27:11.218 --> 27:12.952
What's the address?

27:12.987 --> 27:15.455
2727 Caspian.

27:15.489 --> 27:18.925
The Hiiawatha garage.

27:18.959 --> 27:21.061
Right out in the open.

27:22.297 --> 27:26.333
You will close it down, won't you?

27:26.367 --> 27:28.368
When would you
like me to do that?

27:28.403 --> 27:32.472
Immediately.
Children can see it.

27:34.775 --> 27:39.211
There are now 117 pins here.

27:39.246 --> 27:42.482
Each one marks a location
in this city where alcohol

27:42.516 --> 27:45.418
is being warehoused,
distilled, or sold.

27:45.452 --> 27:47.487
They operate with impunity
and I do not possess

27:47.521 --> 27:49.823
the resources to shut
even 10% of them.

27:49.857 --> 27:52.759
I understand.

27:52.793 --> 27:56.061
Then you'll also understand
that every one of these pins

27:56.096 --> 27:58.263
taken together
amounts to nothing.

27:58.298 --> 28:01.599
Here on the south shore
of brigantine

28:01.634 --> 28:03.268
and here in the back bays
of the inlet,

28:03.302 --> 28:06.371
boats unload liquor
sailed down from Canada,

28:06.406 --> 28:08.440
up from the Caribbean,
across the Atlantic.

28:08.474 --> 28:10.975
It is watered down,
mixed with poisons,

28:11.009 --> 28:13.910
and sold illicitly by a
growing class of criminals

28:13.945 --> 28:17.747
for whom murder is a means
of doing business.

28:17.782 --> 28:21.317
Some of the victims are no
better than killers themselves.

28:21.352 --> 28:23.019
Others are just unlucky.

28:23.054 --> 28:26.690
They are shopkeepers,
schoolteachers.

28:27.825 --> 28:30.327
One was a baker's apprentice.

28:32.664 --> 28:35.332
Do you mean to be cruel,
Mr. van Alden?

28:37.668 --> 28:39.970
No, ma'am.
I mean to be honest.

28:41.305 --> 28:43.874
And what of the law
that creates the criminal?

28:43.908 --> 28:47.145
That's the law you've
just asked me to enforce

28:47.179 --> 28:50.548
for the safety
of your children,

28:50.582 --> 28:54.551
unless I misread
your intentions.

28:56.387 --> 28:58.655
I've been lectured to
a great deal today

28:58.689 --> 29:02.392
by men who speak boldly
and do nothing.

29:05.730 --> 29:09.032
- I'd like to leave now.
- Who else lectured you?

29:09.067 --> 29:10.434
Why should that
be your concern?

29:10.468 --> 29:12.603
Because you don't
want to tell me.

29:12.638 --> 29:15.606
Will you arrest me
in the post office?

29:15.640 --> 29:18.609
Not unless you've
committed a crime.

29:20.547 --> 29:22.948
Mr. Neary.

29:24.084 --> 29:26.018
Mr. Neary lectured you?

29:26.053 --> 29:28.721
Mr. Neary owns
the garage.

29:33.126 --> 29:35.628
James Neary, the alderman
from the fourth ward?

29:35.662 --> 29:37.463
I don't know his first name.

29:37.497 --> 29:40.533
What do you know about him?

29:40.567 --> 29:43.369
He works
for Mr. Thompson.

29:46.072 --> 29:47.740
Now they're frisking people?

29:47.774 --> 29:49.341
After they already
shot up the joint?

29:49.376 --> 29:51.076
Better late than never.

29:52.412 --> 29:54.814
It's like the horse after
the barn door in here.

29:54.848 --> 29:58.051
- After the horse.
- What?

29:58.086 --> 30:00.287
You close the barn door
after the horses are gone.

30:00.322 --> 30:02.256
- That's the expression.
- That's what I said.

30:02.291 --> 30:05.693
No, you said...
look, it doesn't matter.

30:05.727 --> 30:07.627
Fuck the horse.

30:07.662 --> 30:10.096
Torrio don't like headaches.

30:10.130 --> 30:12.765
I think he's already got one.

30:12.799 --> 30:15.868
Those mick bastards...
we should hit 'em tomorrow.

30:15.902 --> 30:18.670
And they'll be soused off
their asses for St. paddy's.

30:18.705 --> 30:20.272
Is that what Torrio wants?

30:20.306 --> 30:22.407
You start worrying about
what other people want,

30:22.442 --> 30:24.709
you'll go batty.

30:28.948 --> 30:33.085
- What happened to her?
- Hi, boys.

30:34.420 --> 30:36.488
Who wants to buy me a drink?

30:37.790 --> 30:39.857
Pearl, what are you doing?

30:39.892 --> 30:41.659
I'm working.

30:41.693 --> 30:43.027
I gotta earn my keep.

30:43.061 --> 30:44.528
You don't have
to work today, honey.

30:44.563 --> 30:47.365
Go on, get her outta here.

30:47.399 --> 30:50.334
Come on, let's go upstairs.

30:50.369 --> 30:52.069
I need more juice.

30:52.103 --> 30:54.605
I'm gonna make you some right now, okay?

30:54.639 --> 30:56.307
What's so funny?

30:56.341 --> 30:59.510
Nothing. Someone told a joke.

30:59.544 --> 31:01.478
Jimmy?

31:01.513 --> 31:03.781
What, sweetie?
What what?

31:03.815 --> 31:06.984
Who's gonna love me now?

31:15.926 --> 31:17.660
Relax, dear.

31:17.695 --> 31:19.929
It's the best thing
when they're overtired.

31:19.963 --> 31:21.430
You should have asked me.

31:21.465 --> 31:23.466
When James was that age
he used work himself

31:23.500 --> 31:25.334
into such an impossible state.

31:25.369 --> 31:28.203
Whiskey and milk
were a godsend.

31:30.240 --> 31:32.675
Do you think she's attractive?

31:32.710 --> 31:35.411
I don't have much time
for movies right now.

31:35.446 --> 31:37.680
I remember how that was.

31:37.715 --> 31:41.350
Of course I used to have the
girls around to help babysit.

31:41.384 --> 31:45.087
Jimmy never wanted
for feminine attention.

31:47.624 --> 31:50.092
I have to meet my friend.
She's waiting.

31:50.127 --> 31:52.695
Well, see a movie, dear.

31:52.729 --> 31:55.764
We're going to take
some air on the boardwalk.

31:55.799 --> 31:58.467
The night before
St. Patrick's?

31:58.501 --> 32:00.802
There tends to be
a lower element abroad.

32:00.837 --> 32:03.705
We'll be very careful.

32:03.739 --> 32:06.541
I'm sure you will be.

32:12.748 --> 32:15.050
You could be free, you know.

32:15.084 --> 32:16.985
Beg pardon?

32:16.986 --> 32:20.422
You're an attractive girl

32:20.456 --> 32:24.659
with artistic leanings...
the painting and all... ardon?

32:24.693 --> 32:30.898
Waiting for a man you're not
married to, who may never return.

32:30.933 --> 32:33.401
I have a child.

32:33.435 --> 32:35.703
I'll raise him.

32:35.738 --> 32:37.739
What?

32:37.773 --> 32:44.412
You go off, have your youthful
adventures and I'll raise Tommy.

32:44.447 --> 32:46.648
You'll raise my son?

32:48.451 --> 32:50.385
Well, think about it.

32:50.419 --> 32:52.020
Talk it over with your friend.

32:52.054 --> 32:53.655
I don't need to think about it.

32:53.689 --> 32:55.790
What kind of thing
is that to say?

32:55.824 --> 32:58.726
I didn't mean to offend you.

32:58.761 --> 33:01.029
I just assumed
that you'd be open

33:01.063 --> 33:05.733
to a different sort of arrangement,
bohemian that you are.

33:05.767 --> 33:08.636
Well, I'm not open
to it at all.

33:08.670 --> 33:11.405
Well, the more fool I.

33:20.949 --> 33:24.352
No need to keep
your friend waiting.

Thank you, Mayor Bacharach.

35:30.477 --> 35:34.246
God bless America and God
bless the emerald isle.

35:34.281 --> 35:38.050
Fellow members of the
ancient order of the Celts,

35:38.085 --> 35:42.355
welcome one and all to our annual St.
Patrick's Eve dinner.

35:42.389 --> 35:46.058
As is our custom, I'd like
to turn over the festivities

35:46.092 --> 35:48.760
to Atlantic county's
esteemed treasurer,

35:48.795 --> 35:52.564
that proud Irishman,
Enoch Thompson.

35:52.598 --> 35:55.967
When do I get to talk?

35:56.002 --> 35:57.602
They're here
to enjoy themselves.

35:57.637 --> 35:59.804
Is it really necessary?

36:01.374 --> 36:05.110
- Hear hear, Nucky!
- Good evening, gentlemen.

36:05.144 --> 36:10.081
This being an election year,
with your kind indulgence,

36:10.115 --> 36:13.251
sheriff Eli Thompson has asked to say
a few words before we get started.

36:13.285 --> 36:16.821
So this one's gonna talk now?

36:21.660 --> 36:24.629
Thank you, Enoch,
Mr. Mayor.

36:28.767 --> 36:32.803
Have a drink.

36:32.838 --> 36:37.608
Your hands are shaking.

36:37.642 --> 36:47.050
- Friends, romans... ...And Irishmen...
- Lend me your beers!

36:47.085 --> 36:50.387
...Tomorrow we will celebrate
our patron Saint,

36:50.422 --> 36:52.390
the beloved St. Patrick,

36:52.424 --> 36:53.958
he what drove the snakes
out of Ireland.

36:53.992 --> 36:55.426
- That's right!
- Hear hear!

36:55.460 --> 36:58.662
Today I submit
for your approval

36:58.697 --> 37:00.531
that he should have drove
the English out.

37:00.565 --> 37:02.666
Yeah!

37:02.701 --> 37:06.070
My friends, it wasn't
a famine of nature

37:06.104 --> 37:08.606
that killed our forefathers.

37:08.640 --> 37:10.241
It was a famine by Cromwell.

37:10.275 --> 37:11.942
- Here here!
- That's right!

37:11.976 --> 37:17.748
And now in our own time the
murdering Brits are at it again,

37:17.783 --> 37:22.553
slaughtering the heroes of the Easter
rebellion in Kilmainham gaol...

37:22.587 --> 37:25.422
- Pearse and McDonagh...
- That's right!

37:25.457 --> 37:27.858
Eamonn Ceannt and Jonah Clarke.

37:27.892 --> 37:31.261
- Thomas, you idiot. - What's he know?
He was born in the states.

37:31.296 --> 37:33.764
Of course.
Yes, Thomas.

37:33.798 --> 37:35.733
You speculating that
those of us born here

37:35.767 --> 37:37.801
are less committed
to the troubles back home?

37:37.836 --> 37:39.903
I'm saying I've seen things
with me own eyes in Dublin.

37:39.938 --> 37:41.505
By what right do the English

37:41.539 --> 37:43.340
suppress our brothers
across the ocean?

37:43.375 --> 37:46.277
My district alone raised
over $2,000 for the fight.

37:46.311 --> 37:49.046
I held a fuckin' line against the Brits
with nothin' more than a fire poker.

37:49.080 --> 37:51.949
- It's my sons who are fighting and dying.
- With arms we provided.

37:51.983 --> 37:53.617
- Up the rebels!
- Up your asses!

37:53.651 --> 37:56.687
By no right at all,
gentlemen...

37:56.721 --> 37:58.922
You're gonna have a fucking
riot on your hands.

37:58.956 --> 38:02.158
-...Our brothers across the
country... - Say that again!

38:02.192 --> 38:06.095
Gentlemen, we here
in the United States, we...

38:06.129 --> 38:07.896
sheriff Eli Thompson,
everybody.

38:11.468 --> 38:13.435
You remember that.

38:13.470 --> 38:16.037
So sit down!

38:16.071 --> 38:20.608
What do you call an
Irishman who doesn't swear?

38:20.642 --> 38:22.777
A mute.

38:22.811 --> 38:25.013
What do you call an
Irishman who doesn't drink?

38:25.047 --> 38:26.714
A corpse.

38:26.749 --> 38:29.384
What do you call an Irishman
from Atlantic City?

38:29.418 --> 38:31.953
It doesn't matter where he's
from; You call him an Irishman!

38:31.988 --> 38:35.024
Erin go bragh!

38:35.058 --> 38:37.493
Now let me hear those pipes.

38:42.066 --> 38:45.836
The little people...
they've been to the end of the rainbow

38:45.870 --> 38:48.339
and they're here
with the pots of gold.

38:58.453 --> 39:00.520
Whoo!

39:08.794 --> 39:10.461
Hey, where's the green beer?

39:10.495 --> 39:11.962
Not this year, assemblyman.

39:11.996 --> 39:13.762
But it's a goddamn tradition.

39:13.797 --> 39:16.898
The feds found our stash.

39:22.671 --> 39:26.907
You gotta go easy
on this stuff, okay?

39:26.942 --> 39:30.010
- Bad girl.
- Not bad, just go easy.

39:30.044 --> 39:33.680
We should go down
to Chinatown for a bowl.

39:33.715 --> 39:35.348
What did I just say?

39:35.383 --> 39:38.352
But it's so much better
when you smoke it.

39:38.386 --> 39:42.823
- Palm trees and sunshine.
- We'll do that, I promise.

39:44.759 --> 39:46.594
Tell me a story.

39:46.628 --> 39:50.364
- About what?
- You.

39:50.398 --> 39:52.299
Something happy.

39:52.334 --> 39:55.769
Uh... okay.

39:55.803 --> 40:00.240
Well, I was...
what, seven?

40:00.275 --> 40:02.643
- What'd you look like?
- Like I do now...

40:02.677 --> 40:06.213
smaller, hair down to here.

40:06.247 --> 40:09.349
- No.
- Yeah.

40:09.384 --> 40:12.986
My mother thought
it looked aristocratic.

40:15.689 --> 40:19.459
Everyone else just thought I was a girl.

40:21.028 --> 40:25.932
Anyway, there was this man... 
Mr. Lancaster.

40:25.966 --> 40:27.400
He was a worth a few dollars,

40:27.434 --> 40:31.170
so my mother figured she
could get him to marry her.

40:31.205 --> 40:32.672
He had a sailboat.

40:32.706 --> 40:35.141
Make it a yacht.

40:35.176 --> 40:37.043
Sure, a yacht.

40:41.181 --> 40:45.885
On the 4th of July he took us
boating, my mother and me.

40:45.919 --> 40:50.256
She was in a white tea dress
and a merry widow hat.

40:50.290 --> 40:54.960
- Mm, she was beautiful.
- She was. She still is.

40:57.530 --> 41:00.165
We sailed past the lighthouse
up along to brigantine

41:00.200 --> 41:03.101
where the pirates used to hide.

41:03.136 --> 41:07.572
Mr. Lancaster showed me
how to use the mainsheet,

41:07.607 --> 41:09.207
put me at the tiller.

41:09.242 --> 41:11.209
I steered us
into little egg inlet

41:11.244 --> 41:15.079
like I'd done it my whole life.

41:15.114 --> 41:18.249
We tied up at egg island.

41:18.284 --> 41:20.218
We went ashore.

41:22.721 --> 41:24.722
My mother told me
to go away for a while.

41:24.757 --> 41:26.858
I was used to that.

41:28.160 --> 41:32.029
So I ran around,
pretending to be a pirate.

41:32.064 --> 41:34.799
And when it was okay
to come back,

41:34.833 --> 41:38.035
Mr. Lancaster dug a pit
in the sand,

41:38.070 --> 41:40.571
loaded in some coals
to roast the lobster

41:40.605 --> 41:47.010
and the corn he had brought,
and we just ate like kings.

41:50.748 --> 41:53.684
When the sun began to set,

41:53.718 --> 41:58.021
Mr. Lancaster told me to go
get this box from the boat.

41:58.056 --> 42:00.991
"And be very careful."

42:01.025 --> 42:04.761
Inside was stars and stripes

42:04.796 --> 42:07.063
he said that his father
had carried at Gettysburg,

42:07.098 --> 42:11.534
which had to be true 'cause
there were bullet holes on it.

42:11.568 --> 42:18.309
So we stuck the flagpole in
the grass and we sang...

42:18.343 --> 42:23.181
♪ My country,
'tis of thee... ♪

42:28.086 --> 42:29.553
...With our hands
on our hearts.

42:29.588 --> 42:31.255
And we watched
the fireworks go off

42:31.289 --> 42:35.191
all the way down the boardwalk.

42:35.225 --> 42:38.160
We sailed home under the moon.

42:38.195 --> 42:42.331
My mother was combing
the sand out of my hair.

42:44.200 --> 42:46.768
That was a good day.

42:51.372 --> 42:53.972
Tell me he married her.

42:55.340 --> 42:58.576
Sure, he did.

42:58.611 --> 43:01.348
Happily ever after.

43:06.221 --> 43:09.523
Shit!
God damn it.

43:09.558 --> 43:13.397
Somebody's gonna really
have to take care of you.

43:15.066 --> 43:18.201
I should wash this.

43:18.235 --> 43:20.603
Kiss me.

43:38.222 --> 43:41.858
Get yourself cleaned up, lover.

44:45.955 --> 44:47.388
Thank you.

44:47.423 --> 44:49.891
It's great to see you again.

44:49.926 --> 44:52.260
There's a time and place, Eli.

44:52.295 --> 44:54.262
You have to know your audience.

44:54.297 --> 44:55.764
Give 'em what they want,
huh, Nuck?

44:55.798 --> 44:57.665
Well, isn't that
what your book says?

44:57.700 --> 44:59.634
The Dale Carnegie?

45:02.637 --> 45:04.804
- Why don't you take a break?
- Why?

45:04.839 --> 45:06.973
Because I'm trying to help
you and you're drunk.

45:07.007 --> 45:09.142
And you're not?

45:09.176 --> 45:12.445
Oh that's right...

45:12.479 --> 45:14.647
This is the one night
of the year you don't drink.

45:14.681 --> 45:18.818
These men, Eli...
these kingmakers you wanted to impress?

45:18.852 --> 45:22.188
You may not think so, but they're
judging you every second.

45:22.222 --> 45:24.924
And when something good
comes along, an opportunity,

45:24.958 --> 45:27.259
they remember the man
who showed good form.

45:27.294 --> 45:30.162
The whole thing's
a game, isn't it?

45:32.198 --> 45:34.433
It's so easy for you.

45:39.606 --> 45:42.007
Well, I'll keep at it.

45:42.041 --> 45:44.309
Maybe one day I'll lie
as good as you.

45:45.345 --> 45:47.946
It's lie as well as me,
you dolt.

45:47.981 --> 45:52.651
You want to be taken seriously,
then learn how to fuckin' speak.

45:52.685 --> 45:55.154
So the leprechaun
looks up at the blonde

45:55.188 --> 45:59.057
and says, "it may
be yellow, lady,

45:59.092 --> 46:01.159
but it's sure
no pot of gold."

46:02.862 --> 46:05.097
Nobody move!

46:05.131 --> 46:06.932
United States bureau
of internal revenue.

46:06.967 --> 46:09.668
- This is a private party!
- This is a raid.

46:09.703 --> 46:12.205
- What the hell is this now?
- Easy, dad.

46:14.141 --> 46:17.110
Do you have any idea
who these men are?

46:17.144 --> 46:18.745
This is a private party

46:18.779 --> 46:21.314
and the mere consumption
of alcohol is not illegal.

46:21.348 --> 46:24.482
Now I'm an attorney, and
the Volstead act clearly...

46:29.522 --> 46:31.623
would anyone else
care to interfere

46:31.657 --> 46:34.192
with the court-appointed duties
of a federal Agent?

46:36.395 --> 46:38.996
Stand down.

46:40.799 --> 46:45.670
Anybody tries to make a
run for it, shoot them.

47:00.853 --> 47:02.654
I have an arrest warrant.

47:08.027 --> 47:14.265
James Neary of 1222 Chelsea Avenue,
Atlantic City, New Jersey?

47:14.299 --> 47:16.634
You are Mr. James Neary?

47:16.668 --> 47:18.369
Yeah.

47:18.404 --> 47:21.039
I have witness testimony that
you knowingly and willingly

47:21.073 --> 47:24.776
stored and transported
intoxicating liquors...

47:24.810 --> 47:27.078
a direct violation
of the Volstead act.

47:27.112 --> 47:29.413
- No, I don't know what
your... - Stand up!

47:29.448 --> 47:31.215
You're under arrest.

47:46.865 --> 47:48.299
This assembly is over.

47:48.334 --> 47:51.269
This establishment
will be shuttered.

47:51.304 --> 47:56.307
Gather your belongings and
disperse in an orderly fashion.

47:56.342 --> 47:59.044
Mr. Neary, how much liquor?

47:59.078 --> 48:00.612
Is there anything
you want to say?

48:00.647 --> 48:02.614
- Just one more picture.
- Was he selling alcohol?

48:02.648 --> 48:04.316
- Who else is in there?
- How many are being arrested?

48:04.350 --> 48:06.017
