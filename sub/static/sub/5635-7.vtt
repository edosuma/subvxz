00:11.642 --> 00:12.981
(mice squeaking)

00:19.156 --> 00:20.924
Ooh, whatcha doing?

00:20.925 --> 00:23.392
Making a...
sexy piggy bank?

00:23.427 --> 00:24.627
No, it's the collection box

00:24.628 --> 00:26.795
for the Donations 4 Carnations
fund-raiser.

00:26.831 --> 00:28.031
Oh, romantic.

00:28.032 --> 00:29.965
How does it work?
What do you do?

00:30.000 --> 00:31.835
Students can buy carnations
to be delivered

00:31.836 --> 00:33.603
to their special someone
on Valentine's Day.

00:33.604 --> 00:35.338
<i>They write the lucky person's
name on an envelope,</i>

00:35.339 --> 00:36.973
<i>put it in the box,</i>

00:36.974 --> 00:39.108
<i>and then wait
for the fireworks on Friday.</i>

00:39.109 --> 00:40.911
<i>There's not going to be actual
fireworks, though.</i>

00:40.945 --> 00:42.411
We couldn't get the permit.

00:42.446 --> 00:44.013
Aw. Still... still romantic.

00:44.014 --> 00:45.615
What are you raising
the money for?

00:45.616 --> 00:47.183
That's TBD.
Either to help end hunger

00:47.184 --> 00:50.353
or re-pave
the faculty parking lot.

00:50.354 --> 00:51.855
Those are the big two.

00:51.856 --> 00:53.857
Yeah, Sophie's choice.

00:53.858 --> 00:55.191
Sophie Martinson
is the treasurer

00:55.192 --> 00:56.192
of the student council.

00:56.227 --> 00:57.794
And we treasure her.

00:57.795 --> 01:00.830
So, Dad, hopefully we'll
sell all 250 carnations.

01:00.831 --> 01:02.899
Okay. Why are you
saying that to me?

01:02.900 --> 01:04.167
Because you said two weeks ago

01:04.168 --> 01:05.468
that you'd pre-order
them for me.

01:05.468 --> 01:06.869
I... I did?

01:06.904 --> 01:08.071
Yeah, I remember that.

01:08.072 --> 01:09.973
I offered but you said,
"No, Linda, I got it.

01:09.974 --> 01:12.008
I'm on this." And then you
seemed a little huffy.

01:12.009 --> 01:13.009
And then you walked away.

01:13.010 --> 01:14.077
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

01:14.078 --> 01:15.812
You did pre-order them,
right, Dad?

01:15.813 --> 01:18.515
Yes. I did.
Pre-order carnations.

01:18.516 --> 01:20.016
Way... way before now...

01:20.017 --> 01:21.884
Since Valentine's Day
is on Friday.

01:21.919 --> 01:23.386
I-I, uh, I-I need to go.

01:23.387 --> 01:24.387
LOUISE: Where are you going?

01:24.388 --> 01:25.522
Just to... ah, move around.

01:25.523 --> 01:26.589
(grunts)

01:26.590 --> 01:28.157
Sitting is, uh, is bad for you.

01:28.158 --> 01:30.159
I mean, it's bad for me,
it's fine for you.

01:30.160 --> 01:31.160
Good!

01:31.195 --> 01:33.830
(Labonz clearing throat over PA)

01:33.831 --> 01:35.532
Good morning, Wagstaff.

01:35.533 --> 01:38.935
Lunch today will be chili.

01:38.936 --> 01:40.603
(paper rustles)

01:40.604 --> 01:43.940
The Donations 4 Carnations
fund-raiser is this week.

01:43.941 --> 01:45.008
(paper rustles)

01:45.009 --> 01:46.276
The weather forecast is meh.

01:46.277 --> 01:48.177
(paper rustles)

01:48.178 --> 01:51.547
The water fountain next to
the boy's bathroom is out of order.

01:51.582 --> 01:54.716
If you must drink water,
do so at these fountains:

01:54.752 --> 01:57.052
the one next
to the girl's bathroom.

01:57.087 --> 02:00.222
The one next to
the 5th grade classroom.

02:00.257 --> 02:01.524
The one in the cafeteria...

02:01.525 --> 02:04.393
Oh, my God,
I can't take it anymore!

02:04.428 --> 02:05.261
Gene!

02:05.262 --> 02:06.696
This is torture!

02:06.697 --> 02:08.031
That is for-sure.

02:08.032 --> 02:10.199
Yes! Ms. Labonz
should have stopped

02:10.199 --> 02:11.768
after "lunch will be chili!"

02:11.769 --> 02:14.904
Stop talking and talking
about fountains, you silly!

02:14.905 --> 02:18.408
Yeah. This is boring,
I want to escape on a boat.

02:18.409 --> 02:20.577
And it's totally gross when
Labonz clears her throat.

02:20.578 --> 02:22.045
(throat clearing over PA)

02:22.046 --> 02:24.447
Here's an announcement
and I am not joking...

02:24.448 --> 02:26.615
Ms. Labonz, you need
to stop smoking!

02:26.650 --> 02:28.952
(laughter) High five!

02:28.953 --> 02:30.453
(groans) Almost.

02:30.454 --> 02:31.454
Want to try that again?

02:31.488 --> 02:33.455
Up here.
High five!

02:33.490 --> 02:35.391
Oh, um, hey, uh, uh...

02:35.392 --> 02:36.959
Hi, Jimmy Jr.
Hey.

02:36.994 --> 02:38.394
So are you gonna
fill a card out now?

02:38.395 --> 02:40.263
Or fill one out later?
What?

02:40.264 --> 02:41.764
Nothing.
Um, it's just, um...

02:41.765 --> 02:43.566
Valentine's Day is coming up.

02:43.567 --> 02:45.234
'Kay. Don't forget when
you're filling it out

02:45.235 --> 02:47.070
to cross your T's
and dot your I's.

02:47.071 --> 02:48.471
And write the "N-A" clearly.

02:48.472 --> 02:49.739
Oh, my God.

02:49.740 --> 02:52.241
Tina, you look way cute today.

02:52.242 --> 02:53.343
Oh, thanks.
I opened a new pack

02:53.344 --> 02:54.409
of barrettes, so maybe that's...

02:54.445 --> 02:55.979
Yeah, yeah.
So how many carnations

02:55.980 --> 02:57.146
am I getting, do you know?

02:57.147 --> 02:58.848
I have the most cards
in there, right? Right?

02:58.849 --> 03:00.783
More than Jocelyn, obvis. Hey!

03:00.784 --> 03:03.686
I have a lot, I have
a lot, right? Right?

03:03.687 --> 03:05.488
Guys, cool it.

03:05.489 --> 03:07.123
I have no idea if anyone's
bought carnations for you.

03:07.124 --> 03:09.258
This box is locked
and very dark inside.

03:09.259 --> 03:10.927
You'll have to wait
until Valentine's Day to find out.

03:10.928 --> 03:14.263
It's like they say...
waiting is fun.

03:14.264 --> 03:16.432
Ugh, Tina, you're
being a smellentine!

03:16.433 --> 03:17.799
Yeah!

03:17.835 --> 03:20.302
♪ I have an announcement
you'll want to hear... ♪

03:20.337 --> 03:24.107
♪ Mr. Branca's mop bucket
is full of beer. ♪

03:24.108 --> 03:26.142
(laughing): You guys kill me.

03:26.143 --> 03:27.510
Do me! Do me!

03:27.511 --> 03:29.479
My middle name's Anthony,
that's easy to rhyme with.

03:29.480 --> 03:30.947
Hmm...

03:30.948 --> 03:32.015
Your first name's Zeke...
(continues)

03:32.016 --> 03:33.315
Those two are dynamite.

03:33.350 --> 03:34.684
God, I haven't seen
chemistry like that

03:34.685 --> 03:36.219
since we got rid of chemistry.

03:36.220 --> 03:37.787
They were doing this
in homeroom this morning.

03:37.788 --> 03:39.355
Yeah? It was the Gene
and Courtney show.

03:39.356 --> 03:41.190
They got me going.

03:41.191 --> 03:43.459
But I canceled my cable,
so I'm desperate for entertainment.

03:43.460 --> 03:44.961
I have cable.
Great.

03:44.962 --> 03:46.396
Just putting it out there.
(chuckles)

03:46.397 --> 03:48.463
Oh, you're looking at your phone,
that's fine.

03:48.499 --> 03:49.666
Maybe morning announcements

03:49.667 --> 03:51.833
could use
a little Mr. Grant makeover.

03:51.869 --> 03:54.070
And that's why I like
pork and beans.

03:54.071 --> 03:55.538
(fart noise)
Thank you, thank you.

03:55.539 --> 03:57.240
You two really have it going on.

03:57.241 --> 03:58.741
Thanks, Mr. Grant.

03:58.742 --> 03:59.842
We used to date.

03:59.843 --> 04:01.643
But now we just collaborate.

04:01.679 --> 04:02.979
Heard about how
you stole the show

04:02.980 --> 04:04.347
during morning announcements.

04:04.348 --> 04:06.082
Yeah, I guess we got
tired of Ms. Labonz

04:06.083 --> 04:07.516
going "onz" and "onz."

04:07.551 --> 04:09.585
She really is awful, isn't she.
Mm-hmm.

04:09.586 --> 04:10.853
I'm the A/V guy.

04:10.854 --> 04:12.722
She lays an egg
on the PA everyday

04:12.723 --> 04:14.257
and it makes us all look bad.

04:14.258 --> 04:15.692
Here's what
I'm thinking instead...

04:15.693 --> 04:18.327
"Morning Announcements
with Gene and Courtney."

04:18.327 --> 04:19.995
Go on.

04:19.997 --> 04:21.596
You two! You know, doing
your catchy jingle-jangles

04:21.598 --> 04:23.298
over the PA system.

04:23.333 --> 04:26.401
Oh, my God. Gene, I think
we're being discovered.

04:26.437 --> 04:28.371
So, should we put
the Announcements With Gene

04:28.372 --> 04:30.173
and Courtney show
on the air or what?

04:30.174 --> 04:32.442
For a one-week trial, pending
final approval by the principal,

04:32.443 --> 04:34.376
the vice principal,
and the assistant vice principal.

04:34.411 --> 04:35.678
I'm in if you're in.

04:35.679 --> 04:37.080
That's what I was gonna say.

04:37.081 --> 04:38.681
Should we try
our high five again? Yeah.

04:38.682 --> 04:40.717
Oh, good. Oh...
Oh, sorry.

04:40.718 --> 04:42.085
That was a lot of
spit in my hand.

04:42.086 --> 04:44.401
(chuckling): Wet and wild.

04:49.402 --> 04:50.735
Let's try it again.

04:50.736 --> 04:51.836
What's up?
Sign-ups, that's what.

04:51.837 --> 04:53.737
Art club sign-ups
today at recess.

04:53.773 --> 04:56.674
Hey-hey, that sounds amazing!
Maybe you could add a little

04:56.675 --> 05:01.179
"Art Club, not Art's Club.
Like what? Who's Art?"

05:01.180 --> 05:03.948
Dad! Knock it off!
This is Gene's and my thing.

05:03.949 --> 05:05.717
Sorry.
Oh, and remember

05:05.718 --> 05:07.519
not to suck on
your necklace during the show.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.087
She knows, Doug.

05:09.088 --> 05:11.456
Sorry, I'm just so excited.

05:11.457 --> 05:13.958
I've always wanted this
life for ya, sweetie!

05:13.959 --> 05:17.228
Nothing's better for a child
than being in showbiz.

05:17.229 --> 05:18.195
GENE: Thanks for the ride, Doug!

05:18.230 --> 05:19.496
Whoa, whoa, hey.

05:19.532 --> 05:21.832
Doesn't your half a muffin want
to go with you to school?

05:21.867 --> 05:23.735
Nah. I left
that there for tomorrow.

05:23.736 --> 05:25.303
And I know exactly
how much there is,

05:25.304 --> 05:26.870
so don't try anything!

05:26.906 --> 05:28.706
All right, so here's
how it's gonna work.

05:28.707 --> 05:30.809
Ms. Labonz will do the first
half of the announcements.

05:30.810 --> 05:32.243
Then you'll come on the air

05:32.244 --> 05:34.312
and blow everyone away
with the better half.

05:34.313 --> 05:36.713
You kids think you can do
the morning announcements?

05:36.749 --> 05:38.882
I am the morning announcements!

05:38.918 --> 05:39.917
GRANT (chuckling): Okay, okay.

05:39.952 --> 05:41.386
Let's calm down everyone.

05:41.387 --> 05:42.987
It's just a one-week trial.

05:42.988 --> 05:44.456
Unless they absolutely crush it

05:44.457 --> 05:45.557
and then your time is up,
Labonz.

05:45.558 --> 05:47.125
(groans)

05:47.126 --> 05:49.294
LABONZ (over PA):
And lastly, Cameron McPherson

05:49.295 --> 05:51.528
won some prize
for reading a book.

05:51.564 --> 05:53.864
Congratulations, Cameron.

05:53.899 --> 05:56.533
And now the rest of
the morning announcements

05:56.569 --> 06:01.872
will be read by two rising
stars here at Wagstaff.

06:01.907 --> 06:03.007

06:03.008 --> 06:05.176

here listening.

06:08.314 --> 06:11.115
I'm gonna come in
and take that Mic back.

06:11.116 --> 06:13.685
Oh, look, here's
a very important

06:13.686 --> 06:17.488
last minute announcement
that must've got misplaced.

06:17.523 --> 06:19.791
You hid that from them
so they couldn't prep.

06:19.792 --> 06:21.826
Damn it, Labonz, you're
not playing fair!

06:21.827 --> 06:23.261
Screw fair.

06:23.262 --> 06:25.463
Okay, okay, the Spanish Club
field trip

06:25.464 --> 06:27.131
to the Mexican restaurant
got canceled.

06:27.132 --> 06:29.100
We can do this!
What rhymes with canceled?

06:29.101 --> 06:30.869
Um...
romance-led?

06:30.870 --> 06:32.937
Gretel and Hanseled?

06:32.938 --> 06:34.272
Guys, come on!
Come on!

LOUISE: Need a flashlight?
Yes... Wait. No.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.047
I wasn't peeking.

07:49.048 --> 07:50.548
And I wasn't spying on you.

07:50.549 --> 07:53.184
Mr. Frond and the entire student
body have put their trust in me.

07:53.185 --> 07:54.852
These are private
Valentine's cards.

07:54.853 --> 07:57.789
I can pick that lock
in, like, two seconds.

07:57.790 --> 07:59.691
Then pick that son of a bitch!

07:59.692 --> 08:01.559
Voila.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.194
Wonder how many
have my name on them.

08:03.195 --> 08:04.862
I'm pretty sure
at least two, but...

08:04.863 --> 08:06.029
who knows, right?

08:06.065 --> 08:08.231
None!
Yikes.

08:08.267 --> 08:10.267
I didn't get a single
carnation?!

08:10.302 --> 08:12.103
Well, Valentine's Day
isn't till Friday.

08:12.104 --> 08:14.438
There's still time for some dope
to buy you a flower.

08:14.473 --> 08:15.907
Jocelyn got four?!

08:15.908 --> 08:18.408
Who the hell is sending Jocelyn
so many flowers?!

08:18.444 --> 08:20.979
Well, I can steam them open
and we could find out.

08:20.980 --> 08:22.380
No one would know we peeked.

08:22.381 --> 08:24.549
We shouldn't...
but we should.

08:24.550 --> 08:25.750
LOUISE: They were tricky,

08:25.751 --> 08:27.785
but I went real slow
and I think...

08:27.786 --> 08:29.754
Tina, what the hell?

08:29.755 --> 08:31.055
(panting): I couldn't help it!

08:31.056 --> 08:32.823
I opened one and then another!

08:32.825 --> 08:33.957
And then another!

08:33.958 --> 08:35.259
Oh, my God, this is...

08:35.260 --> 08:37.629
(laughing): I'm so proud of you!

08:37.630 --> 08:39.496
Now they're separated
and I have no way to know

08:39.498 --> 08:40.931
who sent a card to who!

08:40.966 --> 08:42.399
Why don't you know
who sent the cards?

08:42.433 --> 08:44.602
Because the envelopes only say
who they're to on them

08:44.603 --> 08:46.203
and the cards only say
who they're from!

08:46.238 --> 08:47.738
Well, that's a terrible system.

08:47.773 --> 08:50.274
It's only a terrible system
in this exact scenario.

08:50.275 --> 08:51.843
What do I do?
What do I do?!

08:51.844 --> 08:53.478
What's wrong sweetie?
What's the matter?

08:53.479 --> 08:54.946
Whoa...
Why does it look like

08:54.947 --> 08:56.580
Valentine's Day
threw up in here?

08:56.615 --> 08:58.148
I ripped open all the cards!

08:58.183 --> 09:01.786
Okay, okay, easy sweetheart,
Mommy's here, Mommy's here.

09:01.787 --> 09:03.187
Jocelyn got four cards?

09:03.188 --> 09:04.355
(hyperventilating)

09:04.356 --> 09:06.156
Come on, people,
we can fix this.

09:06.191 --> 09:08.159
We just need to match
the handwriting from the envelopes

09:08.160 --> 09:10.695
to the handwriting on the cards
and just shove them back in.

09:10.696 --> 09:13.830
Are these teeth marks?
Tina you went crazy.

09:13.866 --> 09:15.466
I may have been
a little forceful.

09:15.467 --> 09:16.768
All right, how much time
do we have?

09:16.769 --> 09:17.869
Till Friday morning.

09:17.870 --> 09:19.270
Do you really think
we can fix it?

09:19.271 --> 09:21.439
Sure.
Sure, yeah we could do it.

09:21.440 --> 09:23.274
Mom, you can't tell Dad
I screwed this up.

09:23.275 --> 09:25.476
He was so on top of it with
pre-ordering the flowers

09:25.477 --> 09:27.378
and I... I pre-opened
the envelopes.

09:27.379 --> 09:30.148
Right, I'm sure Dad totally
nailed his end of this.

09:30.149 --> 09:31.314
Right. I know.

09:31.350 --> 09:32.717
(whispering): Yes, hello.

09:32.718 --> 09:34.951
I'm dying
and I'm trying to order

09:34.987 --> 09:37.221
my favorite flowers
for my funeral

09:37.222 --> 09:39.524
which will be
on Valentine's Day.

09:39.525 --> 09:40.858
They need to be carnations.

09:40.859 --> 09:43.760
Wait, wait, wait.
Don't hang up, I'm dying.

09:43.796 --> 09:44.861

09:58.811 --> 10:01.579
No, I mean, what are we doing?

10:01.580 --> 10:04.148
Uh, what's going on

10:04.149 --> 10:05.383
We're holding them.

Now what are we doing?

10:14.927 --> 10:17.561
I think we're...
leaning our faces toward each other.

10:17.596 --> 10:19.129
Why?
To kiss.

10:19.164 --> 10:21.165
That doesn't sound right.

10:21.166 --> 10:23.234
Ah, no, we were kissing.

10:23.235 --> 10:25.748
I think we're gonna kiss again.

10:30.057 --> 10:31.124
Morning, Courtney.

10:31.125 --> 10:32.558
Morning, Mrs. Belcher.

10:32.559 --> 10:34.393
You smell like eggs.
Did you have eggs?

10:34.394 --> 10:35.895
No.
Oh.

10:35.896 --> 10:38.764
Uh, Gene, your ride's here!

10:38.765 --> 10:40.066
Right here, put one right here.

10:40.067 --> 10:41.134

10:41.135 --> 10:43.102
Ah.
Ah.

10:43.103 --> 10:44.637
(groans) Nice.

10:44.638 --> 10:46.939
You know, your line about
the chess club announcement

10:46.940 --> 10:48.608
is better than mine...
Knight to Rook Four,

10:48.609 --> 10:50.576
get your butt
on the chess board.

10:50.577 --> 10:52.411
No, your line is better.

10:52.412 --> 10:54.379
I think you did a much better
job with that line.

10:54.414 --> 10:56.482
I think I did a pretty good job,

10:56.483 --> 10:58.818
but in this instance
your line is the best.

10:58.819 --> 11:00.586
DOUG (sternly): We're here.

11:00.587 --> 11:02.421
Oh, uh...

11:02.422 --> 11:03.789
(locks click)
you closed my door.

11:03.790 --> 11:05.057
And now you locked it?

11:05.058 --> 11:06.626
What do you think you're doing

11:06.627 --> 11:08.227
with my daughter, mister?

11:08.228 --> 11:10.396
You broke her heart
once, literally.

11:10.397 --> 11:11.297
Isn't that enough?

11:11.298 --> 11:12.298
Don't worry.

11:12.299 --> 11:13.933
I'm not using Courtney

11:13.934 --> 11:17.003
to get to your high-end
synthesizers this time, okay?

11:17.004 --> 11:19.472
So you really
like-like Courtney?

11:19.473 --> 11:21.240
Doug, all I know
is we have fun together

11:21.241 --> 11:22.775
and holding hands with her

11:22.776 --> 11:25.511
feels like holding a hand
for the very first time.

11:25.512 --> 11:27.246
And it's, like, the fourth time.

11:27.247 --> 11:30.349
Damn. I haven't felt
that for quite a while.

11:30.350 --> 11:32.518
Good for you two.
Thanks, bro!

11:32.519 --> 11:34.287
You're late.
Is everything okay?

11:34.288 --> 11:35.621
Everything's peachy.

11:35.622 --> 11:37.389
We just shared a pudding cup
at our lockers.

11:37.424 --> 11:38.658
A pudding cup?!

11:38.659 --> 11:40.793
Yes. It was
chocolate-vanilla swirl.

11:40.794 --> 11:43.029
Like Gene's eyes.
Yeah!

11:43.030 --> 11:44.630
What is that...
Are you holding hands?

11:44.631 --> 11:45.631

11:45.632 --> 11:47.366
Well, stop!

11:58.946 --> 12:00.313

12:00.314 --> 12:02.114

Huh, their energy kinda dipped.

12:12.025 --> 12:13.292
I'm tuning out.

weird like it is right now

and everything's gonna be fine.
Mm-hmm.

12:30.677 --> 12:32.245
Mom's at home,
matching up handwriting.

12:32.246 --> 12:34.747
Just sit tight.
And stop talking.

12:34.748 --> 12:35.848
Well...

12:35.849 --> 12:37.817
how is
the big fund-raiser going?

12:37.818 --> 12:40.820
Are we gonna end world hunger
and/or fix the parking lot?

12:40.821 --> 12:42.054
Fine. Everything's fine.

12:42.055 --> 12:43.356
Look at my perfectly
normal face.

12:43.357 --> 12:44.890
Okay...

12:44.891 --> 12:46.859
it's not...
perfectly normal.

12:46.860 --> 12:50.096

normal. Carry on.

Gene, our show
means a lot to me.

15:11.761 --> 15:13.128
I don't want to mess it up.

15:13.129 --> 15:14.996
Same for me.
I feel the same way.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.498
I used to hate mornings,

15:16.499 --> 15:18.333
like those cats
on the coffee cups.

15:18.334 --> 15:19.768
But now I love them.

15:19.769 --> 15:22.003
Because of this show,
because of you.

15:22.004 --> 15:25.440
I don't think we can do the show
and be in a relationship.

15:25.441 --> 15:29.411
Okay, well, if we gotta choose,
I think it's a pretty easy call.

15:29.412 --> 15:31.413
Do the show.
Rela... do the show!

15:31.414 --> 15:33.982
Okay, good.
That wasn't so bad.

15:33.983 --> 15:35.650
Now let's get back
to work, okay?

15:35.651 --> 15:36.818
Mm-hmm.

15:36.819 --> 15:38.086
(groans)

15:38.087 --> 15:39.386
TEDDY: Have you asked
Mort for flowers?

15:39.422 --> 15:41.256
Maybe he's got some leftovers

15:41.257 --> 15:42.424
lying around the funeral home.

15:42.425 --> 15:43.625
Yes, I called.

15:43.626 --> 15:45.026
He only had six stupid tulips.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.028
Ugh, Mort.
It's ridiculous.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.896
You know what you could do?
You go to flower market.

15:48.931 --> 15:50.031
The flower market?

15:50.032 --> 15:51.166
Yeah, it's where florists go

15:51.167 --> 15:52.534
to get their supply.

15:52.535 --> 15:54.302
My cousin used to drive
a forklift there.

15:54.303 --> 15:56.204
He used to drive it around
and pick up chicks, literally.

15:56.205 --> 15:58.039
Thanks, Teddy, I'll head over
there right now.

15:58.040 --> 16:01.443
No, no, no, it's only open
like from 3:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m.

16:01.444 --> 16:03.644
Oh, wow, that's, like,
the middle of the night.

16:03.679 --> 16:05.313
Yup.
I'll pick you up at 2:00.

16:05.314 --> 16:06.781
Wait, you're coming?

16:06.782 --> 16:08.216
Eh, I wasn't gonna
sleep tonight anyway.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.118
I can never sleep
on Valentine's Eve.

16:10.119 --> 16:11.685
LINDA <i>And...</i>

16:11.721 --> 16:12.888
that's the last one!

16:12.889 --> 16:14.189
We friggin' did it.

16:14.190 --> 16:15.524
Huh. I just thought
we'd come across

16:15.525 --> 16:16.791
at least one card for me.

16:16.792 --> 16:18.159
No one came across
a card for me?

16:18.160 --> 16:19.794
Nope.
Yeah, no.

16:19.795 --> 16:21.463
Hey, St. Patrick's Day
is coming up.

16:21.464 --> 16:23.665
I bet you get a lot
of St. Patrick's cards.

16:23.666 --> 16:26.668
Oh, yeah, bet you get a ton
of President's Day cards, too.

16:26.669 --> 16:27.869
Yeah.

16:44.820 --> 16:45.887
It's a rough scene.

16:45.888 --> 16:46.888
It's a flower market, Teddy.

16:46.889 --> 16:47.855
How rough could it be?

16:47.890 --> 16:49.456
(clamoring) Whoa.

16:49.492 --> 16:52.093
It's intense in here.
But it smells nice.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.328
It's the flowers, Bob.

16:53.329 --> 16:54.996
Yeah, thank you, Teddy.

16:54.997 --> 16:57.565
Excuse me, do you know
where we can find carnations?

16:57.600 --> 17:00.001
Come, I'll take you
to the best carnations.

17:00.002 --> 17:01.903
Just have your, uh,
florist license ready.

17:01.904 --> 17:03.171
We aren't florists.

17:03.172 --> 17:04.772
What the hell is this?!

17:04.773 --> 17:07.075
You come into a legitimate
flower wholesale market

17:07.076 --> 17:09.511
without a re-seller license
and just expect to buy...

17:09.512 --> 17:11.012
(quietly): How many
carnations do you need?

17:11.012 --> 17:12.714
Uh, uh, 250?

17:12.714 --> 17:14.516
250 carnations?!

17:14.517 --> 17:16.117
(quietly): Put 20 bucks
in my hand and follow me.

17:16.117 --> 17:18.553
Uh, uh, yeah. Okay.

17:18.554 --> 17:20.055
Here, follow me.
Follow me.

17:20.056 --> 17:22.123
250 white? 250 pink?
What are we doing?

17:22.124 --> 17:23.558
I-I-I don't know.

17:23.559 --> 17:25.126
You don't know?
What's it for?

17:25.127 --> 17:26.926
My kid's school
Valentine's Day thing.

17:26.963 --> 17:28.029
You want red.

17:28.030 --> 17:29.364
Now, there's an added fee

17:29.365 --> 17:30.432
for day-of sales.

17:30.433 --> 17:32.233
Plus the holiday fee.

17:32.234 --> 17:34.736
This is a small order,
so there's a fee for that.

17:34.737 --> 17:37.004
He'll pay, he'll pay anything.
He's desperate.

17:37.039 --> 17:38.239
Teddy, please.

17:38.240 --> 17:39.441
It's for his daughter.

17:39.442 --> 17:40.976
You could charge him
whatever you want.

17:40.977 --> 17:43.812
Wow, that was, uh,
more than I expected.

17:43.813 --> 17:45.714
Kinda raked you over
the coals, huh, Bob?

17:45.715 --> 17:47.282
Yeah, they did.
Thanks, Teddy.

17:47.283 --> 17:49.150
Thanks for coming with me.

17:49.151 --> 17:51.285
Anytime, Bobby,
that's what friends are for. Mm-hmm.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.756
Gene, Gene, Gene.
Yeah?

17:54.757 --> 17:57.057
Heard about the break-up.
Sorry, buddy.

17:57.093 --> 17:57.993
Thanks, Doug.

17:57.994 --> 17:59.461
Yeah. I'm gonna need you

17:59.462 --> 18:01.295
to take that half a muffin
off the seat.

18:02.999 --> 18:06.267
Hi, Lin! Tina! Louise!
We got the flowers!

18:06.268 --> 18:07.402
I... know.

18:07.403 --> 18:08.903
Right, I mean, I m...

18:08.904 --> 18:11.271
I was always gonna get
the flowers, so yeah.

18:11.307 --> 18:12.774
Yeah, and we got the cards.

18:12.775 --> 18:14.509
All sealed up
in their little box

18:14.510 --> 18:16.344
just like they've been the whole
time, the little cards.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.212
Great. Look at us.

18:18.247 --> 18:21.082
So, uh, Teddy helped you get
some last-minute flowers?

18:21.083 --> 18:22.283
Yeah.

18:22.284 --> 18:23.918
Trouble with the cards?
Yeah.

18:23.919 --> 18:25.787
Happy Valentine's Day.
I didn't get you anything.

18:25.788 --> 18:27.122
I didn't get you
anything either.

18:27.123 --> 18:29.090
You want to go make out?
Yeah.

18:29.091 --> 18:32.427
Okay, is Cupid ready
to make the deliveries?

18:32.428 --> 18:34.929
Yup, sure, Cupid.
That's me.

18:34.930 --> 18:38.033
It looks like Cupid's arrow is
here for the following students:

18:38.034 --> 18:40.669
Rupa, two for Julie,

18:40.670 --> 18:42.771
Sam, six for Lenny.

18:42.772 --> 18:44.472
(sighs)

18:44.473 --> 18:46.641
LABONZ (over PA):
Happy Valentine's Day, Wagstaff.

18:46.642 --> 18:48.977
Today is the day for romance,

18:48.978 --> 18:51.613
but it's also the day
to take home

18:51.614 --> 18:54.982
P.E. sweatpants and wash them.

18:55.017 --> 18:57.651
I have an announcement
for you kids.

18:57.687 --> 18:59.521
These are
your last announcements.

18:59.522 --> 19:01.189
(gasping) Don't listen to her.

19:01.190 --> 19:03.491
Unless you suck in there,
and then she's right.

19:03.492 --> 19:04.859
(grunts) What?

19:04.860 --> 19:06.561
Oh, thanks.
